WEBVTT

00:01.843 --> 00:03.719
It's all about location,
location, location.

00:03.745 --> 00:06.579
Now, you know that vacant lot, the
one across the big box store,

00:06.614 --> 00:08.381
on your way into town?

00:08.415 --> 00:11.752
That is a perfect spot
for a buff burger franchise.

00:11.786 --> 00:15.922
So I finally got a meeting
with Bob chomsky, the CEO-

00:15.957 --> 00:17.641
of buff burger, I know.

00:18.458 --> 00:21.460
Never get involved
with a franchise.

00:21.494 --> 00:25.197
You know what that guy wanted
for an upfront payment?

00:25.232 --> 00:27.800
Well, let's just say it was
in the high six figures.

00:27.834 --> 00:31.771
The good news is, the insurance is
gonna cover the cost of the house

00:31.805 --> 00:33.139
and the repairs to the barn.

00:33.206 --> 00:34.338
That's good.

00:34.373 --> 00:36.174
Just good?

00:36.208 --> 00:38.009
<i>Ty, look.</i>

00:38.043 --> 00:40.111
<i>Amy Fleming...</i>

00:41.580 --> 00:43.314
Will you marry me?

00:47.352 --> 00:48.519
Come on, rem!

00:50.755 --> 00:52.256
Hi, Jack!

00:52.290 --> 00:53.791
Where's the fire?

00:53.858 --> 00:55.759
You seen Amy? No.

00:55.827 --> 00:58.662
If you're looking for something
to do, you could help me.

00:58.696 --> 01:00.063
Clean dirt off an old truck?

01:00.098 --> 01:01.431
No thanks.

01:01.499 --> 01:03.566
Come on, remi, let's go!

01:07.037 --> 01:10.173
Come on, Amy, just tell me how
much longer you're gonna be!

01:10.207 --> 01:14.510
Thirty seconds longer than when
you asked me 30 seconds ago.

01:16.613 --> 01:19.982
Amy! Sure you didn't
forget anything?

01:20.050 --> 01:21.817
<i>Nope!</i>

01:21.884 --> 01:23.285
Okay.

01:25.487 --> 01:26.888
There she goes!

01:26.956 --> 01:28.957
So how are things going
with the insurance claim?

01:29.025 --> 01:32.060
Actually, I called them yesterday
and the cheque is in the mail.

01:32.128 --> 01:34.129
You got this? Yeah.

01:34.197 --> 01:35.230
Well, that's good.

01:35.264 --> 01:36.397
So you can buy your old man
a coffee?

01:36.465 --> 01:38.432
I'll even spring for a muffin.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.969
You know, the great thing is me and Peter
can finally find a place of our own.

01:42.003 --> 01:43.070
Oh, house hunting with Peter.

01:43.138 --> 01:44.571
Deja vu all over again.

01:44.639 --> 01:45.906
It's different this time.

01:45.974 --> 01:47.741
Oh, yeah? How?
He's away half the time.

01:47.809 --> 01:49.043
Is he dialling it in now?

01:49.077 --> 01:51.045
He is not away in Vancouver
all the time.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.046
He's home now.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.780
Oh, really. Special occasion?

01:53.848 --> 01:55.215
Ha ha!

01:55.249 --> 01:56.482
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

01:56.550 --> 01:58.918
<i>Oh honey, you
dropped your pogy?</i>

01:58.986 --> 02:00.854
That's not good.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.421
You know what?

02:02.489 --> 02:05.358
Maybe grampa should buy you
a real pogy.

02:05.425 --> 02:06.826
That's all she needs
to hear, dad.

02:06.894 --> 02:07.927
Come on.

02:11.630 --> 02:14.599
It's closed.
How can it be closed?

02:14.633 --> 02:15.700
Lou.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.904
Oh my gosh.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.772
Maggie's for sale?
Really?

02:20.806 --> 02:22.407
Yeah. They just locked the door

02:22.475 --> 02:26.510
and no one even bothered to tell
me because hey, I just work there.

02:27.445 --> 02:29.513
You'll find another job.

02:29.581 --> 02:31.115
It wasn't just a job.

02:31.149 --> 02:33.517
Maggie's was a huge
part of my life.

02:33.551 --> 02:36.720
I mean, my mom used to take
me there when I was a baby.

02:36.755 --> 02:38.189
I had my first
milkshake there.

02:38.223 --> 02:41.458
For all I know, I could've had
my first solid food there too.

02:41.493 --> 02:43.126
It was probably a French fry.

02:43.160 --> 02:47.197
Those fries are tradition in this
town oh well, things change.

02:47.231 --> 02:48.365
Yeah, but it still sucks.

02:50.768 --> 02:52.735
I don't understand
why you're still mad at me.

02:52.770 --> 02:57.607
Come on, Georgie, I was in
the bathroom with the door closed.

02:57.641 --> 03:00.542
Not completely closed...

03:01.878 --> 03:03.812
Hey, where's the big bay?

03:03.846 --> 03:05.414
How come he's not
with the other horses?

03:07.450 --> 03:09.484
Um... what's that?

03:11.922 --> 03:15.689
Stay here, Georgie why?
What's going on?

03:15.724 --> 03:17.125
Just stay here!

03:19.628 --> 03:20.694
Ungh!

03:24.934 --> 03:26.000
Come on!

03:27.469 --> 03:29.837
<i>How can Maggie's
be for sale?</i>

03:29.871 --> 03:32.472
I mean, what's this town
even gonna be without it?

03:32.506 --> 03:33.941
I don't know. But
somebody's gonna buy it,

03:33.975 --> 03:35.542
they're gonna change the name,
it'll be business as usual.

03:35.576 --> 03:37.544
Change the name?
They can't change the name.

03:37.578 --> 03:39.612
It's been Maggie's
all my life.

03:39.647 --> 03:40.981
You know, Maggie is more
than just a place

03:41.015 --> 03:45.452
to buy a sack of oats and a cup of
coffee, it's-it's an institution.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.787
One of the very few
authentic meeting places left.

03:48.822 --> 03:51.290
Someone's probably just gonna tear
it down and build a strip mall,

03:51.358 --> 03:54.293
and no one's even gonna
remember it was-dad?

03:55.895 --> 03:57.296
No, I wasn't aware of that.
Is that right?

03:57.364 --> 03:59.325
Oh, this is an interesting
opportunity.

04:06.472 --> 04:08.606
Georgie, no! No!

04:08.640 --> 04:10.976
<i>He's not moving!
What's wrong with him?</i>

04:12.244 --> 04:13.845
Take your horse
and go back to the barn, okay?

04:13.912 --> 04:15.246
But-please just do it.

Normally, my guess
would be severe colic.

05:11.166 --> 05:13.300
But there was cardiac
muscle damage,

05:13.368 --> 05:17.571
which makes me think
congestive heart failure.

05:17.639 --> 05:19.640
I'll know more
when I get to the lab.

05:19.674 --> 05:23.076
I just don't get it.
You know, he seemed fine.

05:23.078 --> 05:24.577
You know anything about him?

05:24.611 --> 05:26.746
Not really. He just got here.

05:26.780 --> 05:28.881
I do know
he was from a horse camp,

05:28.949 --> 05:30.850
and then a rescue centre
saw him at an auction

05:30.918 --> 05:34.487
and they thought maybe I could re-home
him, so they brought him here.

05:34.555 --> 05:38.357
Guess I didn't do
a very good job, did I?

05:43.063 --> 05:45.130
Hey! Hey-hey! Jack!

05:46.766 --> 05:48.900
What happened
to no heavy lifting?

05:48.935 --> 05:51.170
I don't wanna have to scrape you
off the ground again.

05:51.204 --> 05:55.173
For your information, that
new doctor gave me the once over

05:55.240 --> 05:58.209
and was very impressed
by what she saw.

05:58.243 --> 06:00.111
Great. So you passed
the physical.

06:00.145 --> 06:01.412
Terrific.

06:01.447 --> 06:03.781
How did you do on
the cognitive functioning test?

06:03.848 --> 06:05.783
I remember
how I feel about you.

06:05.817 --> 06:09.019
A-ha!
You remember buff chomsky?

06:09.054 --> 06:11.088
Yeah, hamburger franchise.

06:11.122 --> 06:14.424
Bison burgers.
Buff as in buffalo.

06:14.459 --> 06:16.793
Yeah. The guy who wouldn't
take your calls.

06:16.827 --> 06:18.562
Yeah. Well,
guess who's calling who now?

06:18.596 --> 06:20.197
Tables have turned, buddy.

06:20.231 --> 06:21.698
Well, what does he want?

06:21.732 --> 06:25.835
He wants to put a franchise in
Hudson, and with Maggie's for sale,

06:25.869 --> 06:27.636
he's found
his perfect location.

06:27.670 --> 06:28.770
What, Maggie's?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.773
Now, I know that franchises aren't
cheap, but I'm telling you,

06:31.808 --> 06:35.144
with a little creative accounting, I
can probably pull this deal together.

06:35.178 --> 06:37.713
- What? Maggie's? Maggie's is for sale?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:37.780 --> 06:39.915
I got a good feeling
about this, Jack.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.850
I mean the stars are aligning.

06:44.052 --> 06:46.921
That's great. Wow.

06:46.955 --> 06:49.457
Uh, I'm happy for you.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.660
No, I am, Maggie.

06:52.694 --> 06:55.663
Okay. Give our love to soraya.

06:55.697 --> 06:57.098
Thanks. Bye.

06:58.966 --> 07:01.502
So it's true,
the end of an era.

07:01.536 --> 07:06.140
Maggie is moving to London to be with
soraya and she's selling everything.

07:06.174 --> 07:09.409
Wow. That's a great opportunity
for somebody.

07:09.477 --> 07:12.112
I mean business is booming,
great location.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.247
Yeah.

07:14.681 --> 07:16.616
Why don't you buy Maggie's,
Lou?

07:16.683 --> 07:17.816
Yeah, right.

07:17.884 --> 07:19.218
I'm serious.

07:19.286 --> 07:20.786
You'd be a great owner uh-huh.

07:20.854 --> 07:22.955
And I could be your manager.

07:23.023 --> 07:24.457
Aren't you going to school
in the fall?

07:24.525 --> 07:25.891
Maybe. I don't know.

07:25.925 --> 07:27.860
What do you mean?
Didn't you get accepted?

07:27.927 --> 07:29.828
Everywhere I applied.

07:29.863 --> 07:33.632
There is so many acceptance letters on
the fridge, my mom ran out of magnets.

07:33.699 --> 07:36.134
That's amazing
to have so many options.

07:36.202 --> 07:39.904
Sometimes too many options
is just as bad as none at all.

07:40.873 --> 07:43.475
That's why I'm thinking
of taking a gap year.

07:43.543 --> 07:44.842
A gap year?

07:44.910 --> 07:47.010
What does your mom
think about that?

07:47.078 --> 07:48.646
"If you wanna
waste a year of your life",

07:48.713 --> 07:50.514
you're on your own."

07:50.582 --> 07:53.384
That's why you buying Maggie's
is the perfect solution.

07:53.418 --> 07:56.119
Yeah, maybe for you,
but not for my bottom line.

07:56.188 --> 07:57.888
What about the insurance money?

07:57.955 --> 07:59.256
Peter would kill me.

07:59.291 --> 08:00.891
Every penny is going
into our new house.

08:00.958 --> 08:04.694
Why bother when you have a
perfectly good place to live here!

08:04.728 --> 08:08.431
Well, Peter doesn't quite
see it that way.

08:08.499 --> 08:10.099
Well, whoever buys
it better have deep pockets

08:10.133 --> 08:12.134
'cause you can bet Maggie's
not just giving it away.

08:12.203 --> 08:14.637
Well, I don't care who buys it
as long as they don't change it.

08:14.705 --> 08:17.307
There's been a feed store
on that block

08:17.374 --> 08:20.875
since before the town was
even incorporated <i>in 1906.</i>

08:20.910 --> 08:23.612
Yeah, you were there for the
opening, weren't you, Jack?

08:23.646 --> 08:25.780
Seriously, 1906?

08:25.848 --> 08:28.083
That would make Maggie's
a heritage site.

08:28.117 --> 08:29.518
What would that mean?

08:29.552 --> 08:32.221
Plenty. You know, who ever
buys it can't just demolish it

08:32.255 --> 08:34.422
or renovate it into...
Let's say, a Starbucks

08:34.456 --> 08:36.457
or a fast food restaurant.

08:36.491 --> 08:38.458
Look who's
back - the horsey!

08:38.493 --> 08:39.594
Mommy washed her.

08:39.628 --> 08:42.029
She's all clean
and she's better now.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.264
<i>Num, num, num, num...</i>

08:43.298 --> 08:44.765
<i>Hey, Tim?</i>

08:44.799 --> 08:47.335
Sorry, we're actually trying
not to do baby talk with her.

08:47.369 --> 08:49.837
We're using normal
adult speech.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.571
When do you do this speaking?

08:51.639 --> 08:53.906
The two minutes a day
that you Skype from Vancouver?

08:53.941 --> 08:55.442
Dad! Sorry.

08:57.678 --> 08:59.479
That's okay, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

08:59.513 --> 09:01.248
I'm sure he said
all the nice sensitive things

09:01.282 --> 09:02.982
he's going to say
for one evening.

09:03.016 --> 09:04.183
That's my girl.

09:04.218 --> 09:06.918
Just to be sure,
I'm gonna take her to bed.

09:06.953 --> 09:08.554
<i>Let's go.</i>

09:08.588 --> 09:10.256
Nice one, dad.

09:10.290 --> 09:11.357
Are you done with this, hon?

09:11.391 --> 09:13.459
Hey, where's your ring?

09:15.828 --> 09:17.228
I swear I just had it.

09:17.263 --> 09:18.730
Oh, your ring?

09:19.765 --> 09:21.666
Maybe I could help you out
with that one.

09:21.700 --> 09:22.833
Georgie...

09:22.868 --> 09:26.638
Now, let's see...
Where did I see it?

09:28.206 --> 09:31.142
Ah, voila! Your ring!

09:32.810 --> 09:34.110
Where was it?

09:34.145 --> 09:35.245
In the bathroom.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.614
Guess you're not
mad at me now.

09:41.152 --> 09:42.619
I love the ring, Ty, I do.

09:42.654 --> 09:44.921
I just don't like to wear it
when I'm working.

09:44.955 --> 09:47.157
Well, I can see that.

09:47.224 --> 09:51.294
Hey, what if,
while you're working,

09:51.328 --> 09:53.763
you just wear it on a chain
around your neck or something?

09:53.797 --> 09:56.231
Yeah, like...
Like a ball and chain.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.301
Like a what?

09:58.335 --> 10:00.035
Like a what?

10:00.069 --> 10:02.271
I didn't realize being engaged
to me was such a heavy burden.

10:02.306 --> 10:04.339
Oh well, it has its moments.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.377
Hey, Amy, you read-y?

10:09.412 --> 10:10.978
Okay, never mind.

10:13.316 --> 10:15.684
Georgie and I usually do
night check together.

10:15.751 --> 10:17.218
I'll be right out, Georgie.

10:17.286 --> 10:19.120
Well, why don't you go.
I'll finish up here.

10:19.188 --> 10:20.654
Really? Yep.

10:20.722 --> 10:22.956
Wow! A fiancee
who does dishes?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.192
That's worth more
than a diamond ring any day.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.644
You okay?

10:46.012 --> 10:47.780
Okay about what?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.115
Well...

10:51.652 --> 10:53.485
Seeing that horse
this morning.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.455
You think that's the first time
I've seen something dead before?

10:56.522 --> 10:57.989
Trust me, it's not.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.123
Good to know.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.160
Stuff dies all the time, and
it's not like I really knew him.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.563
He was just some random horse
with no name.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.432
I called him buddy.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.670
Ever since he stepped off the trailer,
he just looked like a buddy to me.

11:12.704 --> 11:14.405
Thumper.

11:14.473 --> 11:17.040
In my head,
I called him thumper.

11:17.075 --> 11:19.610
Because of his rabbit ears?

11:19.678 --> 11:20.878
Yeah.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.519
Did you get
those listings the agent sent?

11:29.587 --> 11:31.187
Uh, yeah.

11:31.255 --> 11:34.257
Agh! Don't get me wrong,
I love your family.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.360
But how great is it gonna be
to have dinner alone,

11:37.428 --> 11:42.698
just the four of us, living the dream
in a house we can call our own.

11:42.766 --> 11:45.033
What's this? "Hudson heritage
preservation program."

11:45.101 --> 11:47.736
It's guidelines for what
constitutes a heritage building,

11:47.804 --> 11:50.472
and Maggie's totally fits
the criteria.

11:50.507 --> 11:52.875
I mean somebody
has to get on this.

11:52.942 --> 11:54.109
Right.

11:54.176 --> 11:56.544
Somebody that's not spending
all their time

11:56.612 --> 11:58.479
trying to find their family
a place to call home, right?

11:58.547 --> 12:00.882
Yes, yes, another somebody.

12:01.817 --> 12:02.884
Good.

12:10.358 --> 12:12.526
But like, just hypothetically,

12:12.593 --> 12:14.895
did you ever think about
the great synergy there could be

12:14.929 --> 12:17.997
between a diner like Maggie's
and the dude ranch?

12:18.032 --> 12:20.133
I mean the opportunity
for tie-ins.

12:20.167 --> 12:22.869
No, no, I never have,
but it sounds like you have.

12:24.505 --> 12:25.472
No.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.041
I mean how crazy
would that be?

12:28.975 --> 12:29.942
Crazy.

12:29.976 --> 12:31.944
Yeah, very crazy, okay?

12:31.978 --> 12:34.012
Almost as crazy as being married
with two kids

12:34.047 --> 12:35.681
and still having to listen
to your grandfather snoring

12:35.715 --> 12:37.182
in the room down the hall.

12:43.723 --> 12:46.123
We had our first date
at Maggie's.

12:55.634 --> 12:58.770
Hey, um, are you doing
some work in there?

12:58.804 --> 13:00.838
Uh, just an estimate for a guy
that's looking to buy the place.

13:00.872 --> 13:01.972
Uh-huh.

13:02.006 --> 13:04.240
And this guy's looking
to renovate or...?

13:04.275 --> 13:05.742
Nope. It's a tear down.

13:05.777 --> 13:07.010
You know
these national chains.

13:07.044 --> 13:09.813
You could be in nunavut or Newark,
New Jersey, they all look the same.

13:09.848 --> 13:13.283
So what is it?
Tim horton's? Wendy's?

13:13.351 --> 13:15.986
Buff burger.
You ever heard of it?

13:20.924 --> 13:22.358
Lonesome trails cowboy camp.

13:22.392 --> 13:24.293
Does that ring any bells?

13:24.327 --> 13:25.628
Lonesome trails...

13:25.662 --> 13:28.263
Yeah, I was just there
doing spring vaccinations.

13:28.298 --> 13:31.501
You still thinking about
that bay horse?

13:31.568 --> 13:32.734
Yeah.

13:32.802 --> 13:35.637
Last July,
they had a horse that died.

13:35.671 --> 13:37.639
Yeah, a blue roan.

13:37.707 --> 13:40.341
Collicked right in front
of those little campers.

13:40.409 --> 13:41.776
Are you sure it was colic?

13:41.811 --> 13:43.011
Because we've been learning
about other conditions

13:43.078 --> 13:45.547
that look like colic,
but they are not.

13:45.615 --> 13:48.149
Really? You learned all that,
did you?

13:59.561 --> 14:00.728
Come on, boys!

14:08.335 --> 14:11.404
No... No, not again.

14:14.842 --> 14:16.042
So did you get the job?

14:16.109 --> 14:20.013
Nope. Apparently
I'm under-qualified.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.781
You wouldn't have been happy
selling underwear all day, anyway.

14:22.815 --> 14:26.384
Since when was making a minimum
wage job about following your bliss?

14:26.452 --> 14:28.987
It's not. That's
why I'm going to Paris.

14:29.055 --> 14:32.758
Paris? Paris, Ontario?
Paris, Texas?

14:32.825 --> 14:35.027
Paris, France.

14:35.094 --> 14:37.695
France?
You're going to France?

14:37.763 --> 14:40.164
I got a job
in a wild west show.

14:40.231 --> 14:44.035
In Paris? Who are you?

14:44.102 --> 14:46.871
An international man
of adventure?

14:46.905 --> 14:50.174
I'm just a cowboy
following his dream.

14:50.241 --> 14:51.341
See ya.

14:56.781 --> 14:59.683
Hey, Jack! You need some help?

14:59.717 --> 15:01.685
No, not from you, I don't.

15:01.719 --> 15:03.553
You should take advantage
of my generosity, you know,

15:03.588 --> 15:05.922
'cause pretty soon I'm gonna
be too busy to be generous.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.127
Dad?!

15:12.195 --> 15:13.963
Hi, Lou!

15:13.997 --> 15:17.066
Tell me that you know nothing
about buff burger coming to town.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.567
I think you're the one
who needs the help.

15:18.602 --> 15:21.503
I might have gotten a call
or two from buff chomsky.

15:21.537 --> 15:23.171
And why would he call you?

15:23.239 --> 15:25.539
He needs somebody local
to help run his new operation.

15:25.574 --> 15:27.308
And he chose you?

15:27.375 --> 15:29.276
Dad, I don't even know
what to say.

15:29.311 --> 15:32.013
How about "congratulations on
your new business opportunity,"

15:32.047 --> 15:33.380
dad?

15:33.415 --> 15:37.218
Congratulate you on turning a small
town icon into a burger franchise?

15:37.252 --> 15:39.353
Over my dead body.

15:39.387 --> 15:41.722
You know what?
You want a fight?

15:41.756 --> 15:42.823
You got one!

15:46.060 --> 15:48.795
What? She'll get over it.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.931
Yeah, she'll get over it.

15:50.965 --> 15:53.299
You are in
for a world of hurt.

15:57.713 --> 16:00.048
Oh, the mayor's busy.

16:00.082 --> 16:03.684
No, actually I cannot wait
until the town council meeting.

16:03.719 --> 16:07.788
Because by then Maggie's
will be a buff burger franchise.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.457
Message?

16:10.491 --> 16:11.525
Yeah, yeah. You bet I do.

16:11.559 --> 16:12.826
How about this:

16:12.860 --> 16:17.264
Our heritage means more to us voters
than a bison burger on a bun.

16:18.666 --> 16:19.833
Did you guys lose something?

16:19.867 --> 16:23.369
Um, my engagement ring.

16:23.404 --> 16:25.038
<i>I kind of took it off and...</i>

16:25.072 --> 16:26.372
You'd think she would've
learned her lesson.

16:26.407 --> 16:28.607
Amy, you lost
your engagement ring?

16:28.675 --> 16:30.310
I misplaced it, okay?

16:30.344 --> 16:31.844
Just don't tell Ty.

16:31.912 --> 16:33.179
I haven't lost it yet,
all right?

16:33.213 --> 16:34.847
I just haven't found it.

16:34.881 --> 16:36.681
That is why I never
take my ring off.

16:36.749 --> 16:38.116
Ever since Peter told me
what happened

16:38.151 --> 16:41.853
when his ex-wife dropped her ring
down the toilet at his parents' farm.

16:41.921 --> 16:44.522
Ew. Did they ever find it?

16:44.557 --> 16:45.790
Oh yeah, yeah, they found it.

16:45.858 --> 16:49.694
But by the time they drained the septic
tank, the marriage was already over.

16:57.202 --> 17:00.171
Hey, Scott,
come check this out.

17:02.707 --> 17:04.976
They haven't updated their
website in over a year.

17:05.010 --> 17:06.410
Oh yeah.

17:07.346 --> 17:09.179
Some of these horses have gone
to horse heaven already.

17:09.246 --> 17:10.946
Like blue - blue roan.

17:11.015 --> 17:12.915
Yeah, and bucky the big bay.

17:12.983 --> 17:15.718
Oh, his lab results came in.
I put them on your desk there.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.119
So did you look at them?

17:17.188 --> 17:19.422
Find out what killed him?

17:19.457 --> 17:22.492
Well, you were right about the
fibrous tissue in the heart muscle.

17:22.559 --> 17:25.160
I was wrong about
the pathogen.

17:25.228 --> 17:27.896
It turns out there was a slow build
up of toxins in his tissues.

17:28.865 --> 17:33.102
So my guess would be it was something
in the environment that killed him.

17:34.404 --> 17:36.438
So what next, Dr. borden?

17:37.673 --> 17:40.174
I think I'm gonna pay
lonesome trails a visit.

17:42.077 --> 17:43.611
Okay.

17:43.678 --> 17:44.712
Mm-hm.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.881
This is definitely
in the ball park.

17:48.884 --> 17:51.119
Enh. No ensuite bathroom.

17:52.621 --> 17:55.689
Look at this open plan.
I love that one.

17:55.757 --> 17:57.590
With two kids? I like doors.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.693
Okay, good.

18:00.728 --> 18:03.196
Fine. That's no problem.

18:04.165 --> 18:06.233
We'll find something
one of these years.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.334
I'm sorry.

18:07.368 --> 18:08.902
I'm just a little
bit distracted.

18:08.936 --> 18:10.803
But uh...

18:12.305 --> 18:14.273
Yeah, I read
your latest blog post.

18:14.307 --> 18:15.541
Oh, did you?

18:15.575 --> 18:18.077
As soon as I put it up,
I got like 76 replies.

18:18.145 --> 18:21.347
Crazy! But, you know, no one can believe
some creep can just waltz into town

18:21.381 --> 18:24.116
and turn a heritage site
into a burger franchise.

18:24.151 --> 18:25.284
I must have missed that.

18:25.318 --> 18:28.486
When was Maggie's declared
a heritage site?

18:28.521 --> 18:30.188
It's... on-going.

18:30.222 --> 18:32.157
You know,
it's a work in progress.

18:32.191 --> 18:33.925
Mm-hm.

18:33.959 --> 18:36.594
So instead of looking
for a house,

18:36.628 --> 18:39.597
you're gonna become a crusader
to save Maggie's, is that-

18:39.631 --> 18:41.199
no, honey, it's not like that.

18:41.233 --> 18:42.633
Well, what's it like then?

18:42.668 --> 18:44.601
Please tell me 'cause I'm...

18:44.635 --> 18:45.902
Is it a family feud
with your dad

18:45.937 --> 18:47.938
or something?

18:52.577 --> 18:53.643
Okay, I'm sor-

18:55.346 --> 18:56.880
just do me a favour
and ask yourself

18:56.914 --> 19:00.116
what's important to you
and your family, okay?

19:00.150 --> 19:03.852
And I really hope the answer's
not a diner and a feed store.

19:12.563 --> 19:13.796
<i>Here's
something I can do.</i>

19:13.830 --> 19:15.231
"Petite models wanted.

19:15.265 --> 19:18.600
Must have your own car.
No experience necessary."

19:18.667 --> 19:19.801
No, no.

19:19.835 --> 19:23.738
Okay, look, if you really need work,
between the dude ranch and babysitting,

19:23.772 --> 19:26.208
there's always a ton to do
around here.

19:26.275 --> 19:29.777
Okay, but you're not
giving up on Maggie's!

19:29.812 --> 19:32.113
You know, the for sale sign
is still in the window.

19:32.180 --> 19:35.549
Actually, I've decided, from now
on, I'm putting my family first.

19:35.617 --> 19:41.322
I'm sorry, but you need Maggie's and,
more importantly, Maggie's needs you!

19:41.356 --> 19:42.556
And why is that?

19:42.591 --> 19:45.426
Because if someone doesn't
do something fast,

19:45.494 --> 19:48.495
the entire main street is gonna
be renovated out of existence.

19:48.529 --> 19:50.530
It's not a renovation, okay?

19:50.564 --> 19:52.565
It's a tear down.

19:52.633 --> 19:53.799
That's what buff burger does.

19:53.867 --> 19:56.236
They just come in and they
destroy the whole place.

19:56.303 --> 19:58.738
Why wouldn't they?
What do they care?

19:58.805 --> 20:00.373
They don't.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.908
I sorta wish I didn't either.

20:07.046 --> 20:09.148
You're a vet?
We didn't call a vet.

20:09.215 --> 20:10.682
Well, actually,
I'm a vet student.

20:10.716 --> 20:12.717
Dr. cardinal,
he asked me to come by

20:12.785 --> 20:14.386
and re-check the horses
after their vaccinations

20:14.420 --> 20:16.921
to make sure
there's no adverse reactions.

20:16.989 --> 20:18.323
Good idea.

20:18.358 --> 20:20.125
With camp starting in a week,
better safe than sorry.

20:20.192 --> 20:21.259
Okay.

20:29.034 --> 20:30.968
This one looks good.

20:31.036 --> 20:33.070
No swelling
at the injection site.

20:33.138 --> 20:36.406
At lonesome trails,
we're all about the horses.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.775
You see, Adele and me,
we're not selling a product.

20:38.842 --> 20:40.810
We offer an experience.

20:40.878 --> 20:42.312
The triple c's:

20:42.380 --> 20:44.847
Communication, cooperation,
compromise.

20:44.882 --> 20:46.483
It equals...

20:46.551 --> 20:47.884
Perfect harmony.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.453
Well, I'm all for harmony,

20:50.488 --> 20:53.889
but you shouldn't keep chickens
so close to your horses there.

20:53.923 --> 20:55.457
Those birds, they
have the run of the place.

20:55.492 --> 20:57.859
Campers, they get a real kick
out of 'em.

20:57.894 --> 20:59.395
I'll bet.

20:59.429 --> 21:01.263
I'm sure you're aware that
some chicken feed has additives

21:01.298 --> 21:02.498
<i>that aren't good for horses.</i>

21:02.532 --> 21:03.899
Additives?

21:03.966 --> 21:05.534
Stuff they put in feed
to promote growth.

21:05.569 --> 21:08.836
It's for poultry. But if horses eat it,
it could build up in their system.

21:08.904 --> 21:10.371
So?

21:10.406 --> 21:12.473
Well, it can eventually
kill them.

21:12.541 --> 21:16.277
What are you talking about? Our horses
eat grain and hay, not chicken feed.

21:16.312 --> 21:19.681
Maybe not on purpose,
but they are eating it.

21:19.715 --> 21:22.417
You had a horse die last
summer, his name was blue.

21:22.451 --> 21:23.851
Don't talk to me about blue.

21:23.885 --> 21:26.986
And then the bay -
I think his name was bucky.

21:27.021 --> 21:29.823
Bucky? Bucky's dead, too?

21:29.857 --> 21:31.958
He died from a build up
of toxins in his system.

21:31.992 --> 21:33.727
So what? You're calling me
a horse killer now?

21:33.761 --> 21:35.596
No. You see how these
things get started?

21:35.630 --> 21:36.630
It's okay, Adele.

21:36.664 --> 21:37.897
No, Raymond, it's not.

21:37.932 --> 21:41.367
Listen, friend, I suggest
you mind your own business.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.168
How long do you think
you're gonna be?

21:44.104 --> 21:45.438
I need half an hour.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.540
I'll give you fifteen minutes.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.410
Sorry, pal.

21:53.714 --> 21:55.481
You guys, great timing.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.715
I need the kitchen.

21:56.749 --> 21:57.716
What are you making?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.517
Muffins. For Maggie's.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.586
Really, Lou? A bake sale?
Come on.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.488
No, no, no, see, the
muffins are to remind people

22:03.522 --> 22:04.922
what they'll miss out on.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.859
First, they eat the muffin,
then they sign the petition.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.895
Ew...

22:10.929 --> 22:11.963
Nasty.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.431
Let's see what we got here.

22:14.466 --> 22:19.536
There's hair, potato peel,
fingernail clippings.

22:19.571 --> 22:20.537
Ugh!

22:20.572 --> 22:21.705
No ring?

22:21.740 --> 22:26.610
If it's not in this p-trap, it must
have gone into the septic tank.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.911
Grampa, please?

22:28.979 --> 22:30.380
No. Not... no!

22:30.382 --> 22:31.481
No.

22:40.624 --> 22:42.024
What the hell?

22:51.937 --> 22:54.956
Amy, tell me this isn't ridiculous.

22:55.605 --> 22:57.272
You know what's in here,
don't ya?

22:57.307 --> 22:58.740
Oh!

22:58.775 --> 23:01.309
Come on, grampa,
we've got to at least try.

23:01.343 --> 23:03.210
You owe me for this.

23:04.145 --> 23:05.746
Something wrong
with the septic tank?

23:05.814 --> 23:07.515
No, the tank's fine.

23:09.584 --> 23:12.520
But something
else really smells.

23:12.554 --> 23:14.355
You!

23:14.423 --> 23:16.056
Yeah, me.

23:16.124 --> 23:19.192
Okay, I just got finished cleaning all
the chicken crap out of my truck.

23:19.226 --> 23:21.461
A little "gift" from the
lonesome trails cowboy camp.

23:21.529 --> 23:24.163
Or more like a message -
don't come back.

23:24.231 --> 23:25.298
Why don't you tell me
all about it.

23:25.333 --> 23:29.135
We'll get you into some sweatpants
so I can wash those jeans.

23:29.203 --> 23:33.505
Well... here goes nothing.

23:38.578 --> 23:39.911
Where is everybody?

23:39.979 --> 23:41.112
They'll be here.

23:41.180 --> 23:46.385
I contacted all the local media and
I even posted an online petition.

23:46.419 --> 23:48.519
So they will come.

23:48.587 --> 23:51.322
<i>Well, at least we
got one concerned citizen.</i>

23:54.593 --> 23:56.994
Where is everybody?

23:57.028 --> 23:58.763
<i>What's this one?</i>

23:58.797 --> 24:04.134
Looks like banana... crunch.
Mm. How much?

24:04.169 --> 24:05.435
I'm not here
to raise money, dad.

24:05.536 --> 24:07.337
I'm here to raise awareness.

24:07.405 --> 24:11.675
Lou, this buff burger thing,
it makes a lot of financial sense.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.611
I can show you their numbers
and projections.

24:14.679 --> 24:17.113
Honey, why don't you
go in on it with me.

24:17.147 --> 24:19.082
Dad, you don't get it, do you?

24:19.116 --> 24:20.850
I want Maggie's
to stay the way it is;

24:20.884 --> 24:23.051
You want to turn it
into a franchise.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.820
Here I thought you
were a businesswoman.

24:24.855 --> 24:26.321
For your information,

24:26.356 --> 24:28.891
complete strangers have been
sending in online donations.

24:28.925 --> 24:32.060
Buff burger is going down and
you are going down with it!

24:32.128 --> 24:33.596
No. Nobody's gonna
stop buff burger

24:33.630 --> 24:36.431
unless they make a better offer
and buy the damn place.

24:36.465 --> 24:38.099
So maybe I will.

24:38.133 --> 24:40.134
Maybe I will buy
the damn place!

24:40.168 --> 24:42.336
Well, it's gonna take real money,
not nickel and dime donations.

24:42.405 --> 24:43.571
Do you know how much
they're asking for it?

24:43.639 --> 24:46.941
Yeah, I do, and I can handle it
no problem.

24:46.975 --> 24:49.076
You think Peter's gonna let you
touch that insurance money?

24:49.111 --> 24:50.378
You're crazy.

24:50.446 --> 24:52.213
I'd rather be crazy
than a conniving opportunist

24:52.247 --> 24:53.714
who could care less
about his community.

24:53.748 --> 24:55.449
The thing about opportunists,
Lou,

24:55.483 --> 24:57.851
is that we don't waste our time
on lost causes.

24:57.886 --> 24:59.252
Oh, talk about a lost cause!

24:59.287 --> 25:01.422
Only a fool would go up
against his own daughter,

25:01.456 --> 25:03.424
especially if that daughter
is me!

25:03.458 --> 25:05.793
Fine! You wanna make this
personal?

25:05.827 --> 25:07.428
You're on!
That's for the muffin.

25:07.462 --> 25:10.563
Keep it! Looks like you're gonna
need it the way things are going.

25:11.498 --> 25:12.899
Thank you.

25:15.220 --> 25:17.789
<i>Hey, Tim!</i>

25:17.823 --> 25:18.956
Lou doesn't want your money.

25:18.991 --> 25:20.992
No, no, keep it.

25:21.059 --> 25:23.160
I'm sorry you had to see that.

25:23.195 --> 25:25.095
A couple of hot-heads
goin' at it.

25:25.129 --> 25:27.063
Runs in the family.

25:27.098 --> 25:29.633
Yeah, well, that's the beautiful
thing about families, Mallory,

25:29.701 --> 25:31.535
you fight, you make up.

25:31.569 --> 25:34.772
You know, for Lou and I,
it's water off a duck's back.

25:34.806 --> 25:37.474
Really? You're talking
about Lou.

25:37.509 --> 25:40.143
The one who was so mad at you
she was turning purple?

25:40.177 --> 25:41.544
Let me ask you something.

25:41.578 --> 25:45.314
What is so wrong
with a buffalo Patty on a bun?

25:45.348 --> 25:46.348
Nothing.

25:46.383 --> 25:47.784
I actually prefer it
over beef.

25:47.851 --> 25:49.018
Exactly.

25:49.052 --> 25:52.121
When I get that
franchise going...

25:53.290 --> 25:56.825
When I get that franchise going,
there's a job in it for you.

25:56.859 --> 26:00.629
Okay. But I wouldn't wanna
be a waitress.

26:00.696 --> 26:03.532
I mean...
If I were to work for you,

26:03.599 --> 26:05.600
I'd want to be manager.

26:05.668 --> 26:07.669
Manager, wow!

26:07.703 --> 26:09.137
Striking while the iron's hot.

26:09.171 --> 26:10.906
Didn't know
you were an opportunist.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.373
See, despite what
my daughter might say,

26:13.442 --> 26:18.512
being an opportunist is a
good thing, manager Mallory.

26:20.214 --> 26:21.749
I gotta run.

26:25.253 --> 26:26.720
Hey. Hey.

26:26.788 --> 26:27.721
Coming to bed?

26:27.789 --> 26:28.988
Yeah, in a sec.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.157
Uh, do you want to take
a look at something?

26:31.224 --> 26:32.391
Check this out.

26:32.460 --> 26:35.995
I, uh, found these photos
in the city archives.

26:36.063 --> 26:39.165
<i>The building actually</i>
<i>dates back to 1902.</i>

26:39.232 --> 26:44.437
Hmm. And here I'm thinking you
were looking at real estate listings.

26:45.404 --> 26:48.440
I'm making my presentation
tomorrow.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.209
What presentation? To who?

26:51.243 --> 26:52.678
The town council.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.045
Tomorrow?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.914
Well, we're looking
at real estate tomorrow.

26:55.982 --> 26:56.915
We got appointments,
all these listings.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.083
I know, I know.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.786
But honey, if you can patient
with me for a couple more days,

27:01.820 --> 27:04.755
then once I can get Maggie's
declared a heritage site,

27:04.790 --> 27:07.692
buff burger will be
out of the equation.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.326
And then what, Lou?

27:09.361 --> 27:12.563
And then I can buy the building
for something pretty reasonable.

27:12.598 --> 27:14.799
Oh! Buy the building?

27:14.833 --> 27:16.100
You wanna buy
the building?!

27:16.167 --> 27:17.133
Keep your voice down!

27:17.201 --> 27:18.334
What is reasonable about that?

27:18.402 --> 27:19.836
Honestly! How're you going
to pay for it?

27:19.904 --> 27:22.506
What, you got money hidden under the
mattress I don't know about or something?

27:22.573 --> 27:24.708
I'm working on
a business plan, okay?

27:24.742 --> 27:26.409
Okay, work on this.

27:26.443 --> 27:27.911
Every cent from that
insurance settlement

27:27.945 --> 27:30.179
has to go into the purchase
of our new house.

27:30.247 --> 27:31.515
Okay.

27:31.549 --> 27:34.349
New house? Why
do we need a new house?

27:34.417 --> 27:37.052
I don't want to move.
I like it here.

27:37.120 --> 27:40.689
Georgie.

27:40.724 --> 27:42.324
Perfect.

27:45.061 --> 27:46.896
Even better.

27:46.963 --> 27:49.731
Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
go look at houses, okay?

27:49.765 --> 27:50.999
I've taken time off work.

27:51.033 --> 27:52.466
I cleared my schedule,
I made it my priority.

27:52.501 --> 27:53.701
I really hope you do the same.

27:53.736 --> 27:55.269
Peter.

27:55.303 --> 27:56.704
Daddy's coming, Katie.

27:59.742 --> 28:02.677
So... I gotta
agree with Peter.

28:03.779 --> 28:06.914
Just give it up, Lou.
Just move on.

28:07.916 --> 28:09.616
I thought I was
the good guy here.

28:14.522 --> 28:18.258
Lou, the meeting's
about to start, where are you?

28:18.292 --> 28:21.226
Now? You're gonna look
for houses now?

28:21.261 --> 28:25.031
I'm sorry, Mallory,
but I'm doing what I have to do.

28:26.633 --> 28:28.701
I don't want to
move and neither does Katie!

28:28.769 --> 28:30.102
We're not moving.

28:30.136 --> 28:32.404
We're looking for a place,
right?

28:32.439 --> 28:38.276
That we all like, and when we find it
then we'll talk about moving, okay?

28:38.343 --> 28:41.212
Uh, Lou, have you seen my
jeans that Amy washed for me?

28:41.246 --> 28:42.447
Uh, they're right here.

28:42.514 --> 28:43.448
Oh, yeah.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.083
Oh, thanks.

28:45.117 --> 28:46.350
Are you looking for something?

28:46.385 --> 28:48.486
Uh, no. Nothing. It's just...

28:51.757 --> 28:53.523
Did you happen to see anything
in the washer or the dryer?

28:54.459 --> 28:57.928
The anything you didn't lose? Uh, no,
but you're welcome to have a look.

29:02.734 --> 29:04.334
<i>All right, ready to go?</i>

29:04.402 --> 29:06.570
Are you kidding?
It's gonna be great!

29:06.638 --> 29:07.838
Road trip!

29:07.872 --> 29:10.206
What's uh-
what's he doing here?

29:10.240 --> 29:11.674
I don't know.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.175
Hey, I'm glad I
caught you, guys.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.544
Dad, bad timing, okay?
We have a thing.

29:15.613 --> 29:19.348
Lou, I know we have our differences,
but there's always time for family.

29:19.416 --> 29:22.551
Come here,
I got something for you.

29:22.620 --> 29:24.987
I've got a surprise for you!

29:28.057 --> 29:30.092
Okay, here he is, everybody!

29:32.028 --> 29:33.495
Oh, he's so cute!

29:33.562 --> 29:36.131
Look, Katie, your first pony!

29:36.198 --> 29:39.067
Here you go. Let's just see.

29:40.702 --> 29:42.703
A real life pogy.

29:44.139 --> 29:45.205
Here we go!

29:45.240 --> 29:46.573
Do you
wanna go on a ride?

29:46.608 --> 29:47.675
Let's go for a ride.
Come on, pogy.

29:47.743 --> 29:49.010
<i>Let's go.</i>

29:49.044 --> 29:51.612
Can you believe Lou
just weaseled out like that?

29:51.680 --> 29:53.714
I was counting on
that manager job.

29:53.749 --> 29:55.349
Well, there's always
buff burger.

29:55.416 --> 29:57.383
Maybe you could talk to Tim.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.152
I already did.

30:00.121 --> 30:02.789
Does that make me
just as weaselly as Lou?

30:02.823 --> 30:05.058
What are you talking about?

30:05.092 --> 30:07.293
I only cared about
a stupid job.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.328
Lou was fighting
for our history.

30:09.396 --> 30:11.097
In a couple of months,
the kids in this town

30:11.165 --> 30:13.231
are just gonna be scarfing
down buffalo burgers.

30:13.266 --> 30:14.299
And they're not gonna
give a thought

30:14.333 --> 30:18.203
to how Hudson was a pioneer
town on a stagecoach line.

30:18.271 --> 30:22.274
Or that this place is more than chain
restaurants and big box stores.

30:23.209 --> 30:25.610
Well, you sold me...

30:25.679 --> 30:27.680
Bet you could sell him too.

30:28.614 --> 30:30.081
The mayor?

30:30.115 --> 30:31.315
You think I should talk
to the mayor?

30:31.349 --> 30:32.583
What would I say?

30:32.617 --> 30:33.685
Plenty.

30:35.120 --> 30:38.056
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Mr. mayor.

30:38.090 --> 30:41.192
Hi, I'm Mallory Wells.

30:41.226 --> 30:42.593
Brush the pony, Katie.

30:42.627 --> 30:47.430
Good job. You're gotta press nice and
hard, or else you're just tickling him.

30:47.464 --> 30:49.199
So did Lou ever tell you
that she and Amy had ponies

30:49.233 --> 30:51.267
before they could even walk?

30:52.203 --> 30:53.570
Probably not.

30:54.505 --> 30:55.806
Can I take
Katie for a ride?

30:55.840 --> 30:56.840
Sure. I'll come with you!

30:56.874 --> 30:58.241
<i>Okay.</i>

30:58.275 --> 31:00.543
You wanna go for a ride?!
Let's go, come on.

31:01.912 --> 31:03.378
Come on, pogy.

31:03.413 --> 31:06.315
Lou, that little pony...
It's like a family tradition.

31:06.349 --> 31:09.085
Actually, dad,
it's like bribery.

31:10.954 --> 31:13.022
Lou! Lou, slow down!

31:14.925 --> 31:17.959
Honey, listen,
help me understand something.

31:18.027 --> 31:20.695
You and I don't agree
on a business deal

31:20.730 --> 31:23.231
and now I can't buy gifts
for my granddaughter?

31:23.265 --> 31:25.666
So you can worm your way
back into my good books?

31:25.701 --> 31:27.736
You got this wrong.

31:27.770 --> 31:29.904
This buff burger idea
was not some...

31:29.939 --> 31:32.173
Part of a conspiracy
to ruin your life.

31:32.208 --> 31:35.275
I wanted to build something.

31:35.309 --> 31:37.644
I wanted to leave something
for you kids.

31:37.678 --> 31:41.580
Dad, I wanna build something too, and
if you bothered to do any research,

31:41.648 --> 31:44.917
you would have seen that Maggie's
has always turned a decent profit.

31:44.952 --> 31:46.652
If you compare that
to the exorbitant franchise fees

31:46.686 --> 31:48.054
you'd be paying...

31:48.088 --> 31:49.055
Hang on, I gotta take this.

31:49.089 --> 31:50.923
Hello! Buff!

31:52.359 --> 31:53.626
Yeah!

31:55.528 --> 31:57.095
Well, what do you mean?

31:57.163 --> 31:59.631
Well, why is that my fault?

32:00.566 --> 32:02.000
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

32:04.036 --> 32:05.971
Yeah, well, same to y-

32:17.282 --> 32:18.682
We gotta talk.

32:22.854 --> 32:25.622
Hey. Better be good.

32:25.690 --> 32:26.791
I'm missing a pony ride
for this.

32:26.825 --> 32:28.759
Yeah, it's good,
so just listen.

32:28.826 --> 32:31.627
Buff chomsky didn't get
his zoning change.

32:31.695 --> 32:34.798
The town council just declared the
entire block a heritage site.

32:36.733 --> 32:39.368
Okay, I'm still not seeing
how this is good news for me?

32:39.436 --> 32:40.970
Buff chomsky won't be
buying Maggie's

32:41.038 --> 32:45.808
to tear it down for his damn
franchise, so Lou can put in an offer.

32:45.842 --> 32:48.243
She can probably pick it up
for a song.

32:48.311 --> 32:50.712
Okay, I don't know
if you've heard yet or not, Tim,

32:50.780 --> 32:51.880
but we're not interested
in Maggie's.

32:51.948 --> 32:53.782
We're trying to buy a house
right now.

32:53.817 --> 32:55.317
I'm missing my real estate
appointment for this.

32:55.384 --> 32:57.085
Oh, really? Yeah.

32:58.354 --> 33:01.088
With two kids at home and a
husband who's away half the time,

33:01.156 --> 33:04.258
why would Lou want to sit
in a house by herself

33:04.326 --> 33:06.694
when she's got a perfectly good home
here at heartland? See? Thanks.

33:06.761 --> 33:07.795
I'm done here, Tim.

33:07.830 --> 33:09.197
It's not about you, general.

33:09.264 --> 33:12.733
It's about your wife,
my daughter.

33:14.703 --> 33:18.004
It's about Lou putting her heart
and soul into a labour of love

33:18.072 --> 33:21.674
and making money hand over fist
while she's at it.

33:21.742 --> 33:23.076
What? What?

33:23.110 --> 33:25.212
Are you not seeing
what I'm saying here?

33:25.246 --> 33:28.148
You know what I'm seeing,
honestly?

33:28.182 --> 33:29.182
It's just someone
who's doing a one-eighty.

33:29.217 --> 33:31.151
That's it.

33:31.185 --> 33:34.686
Okay, yeah. I was a jerk.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.923
I was a jerk for backing buff
chomsky and not my daughter.

33:37.958 --> 33:43.262
But now you have a chance to be a bigger
jerk by standing in your wife's way.

33:44.797 --> 33:46.131
I don't know what you want
from me here, Tim, okay?

33:46.166 --> 33:48.367
I'm not made of money,
all right?

33:48.401 --> 33:51.635
And even if they have re-zoned it or
it's a heritage site now or whatever,

33:51.670 --> 33:53.771
Maggie's is not gonna come cheap,
I'm telling you. Not cheap.

33:53.805 --> 33:55.473
Not cheap, but doable...

33:55.507 --> 33:58.476
If I get involved
and help out.

33:58.510 --> 33:59.577
What do you mean
help out? What?

33:59.611 --> 34:00.811
You talking about a loan
or something?

34:00.846 --> 34:03.047
Joint investment.

34:03.082 --> 34:06.316
I'll take the money I was gonna
put in that stupid franchise

34:06.351 --> 34:09.552
and I'll back
my daughter instead.

34:09.587 --> 34:13.190
I'll tell you, the
problem with that is,

34:13.257 --> 34:15.958
the way things have been going with you
and Lou, she's never gonna go for it.

34:15.994 --> 34:17.226
Doesn't have to know.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.661
Huh? Doesn't have to know.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.833
What's that,
we just shake hands and...

34:24.868 --> 34:27.235
Your word and a handshake
and that's it?

34:27.271 --> 34:30.339
It's all it takes
when you're family.

34:33.918 --> 34:35.163
<i>What if we get arrested?</i>

34:35.196 --> 34:36.696
It's not gonna happen.

34:36.697 --> 34:40.801
All I need is a small sample of the
chicken feed that they're using, okay?

34:40.835 --> 34:43.335
Well, why don't
you just ask them?

34:43.371 --> 34:45.538
They were a little
defensive before.

34:45.572 --> 34:47.739
Well, yeah,
their camp sucks.

34:47.774 --> 34:50.143
I mean all you have to do
is go online.

34:50.177 --> 34:53.446
A couple of kids saw a horse die last
year, now no one wants to go back.

34:53.481 --> 34:55.447
I mean I would never want
to go there.

34:55.516 --> 34:57.378
But you're gonna pretend
like you do, right?

34:58.518 --> 35:00.419
Right, Georgie?

35:00.487 --> 35:02.354
Yeah.

35:02.422 --> 35:04.423
Okay, let's go.

35:04.457 --> 35:05.991
Georgie, you
are gonna love it here.

35:06.059 --> 35:09.194
And your auntie Amy tells me
you're a real horse crazy kid.

35:09.262 --> 35:10.896
Auntie Amy?

35:25.344 --> 35:27.278
Our campers come
from all over the world.

35:27.346 --> 35:29.080
Such a great group.

35:29.148 --> 35:30.580
Do we have
to shower in groups?

35:30.614 --> 35:32.282
'Cause that's
not gonna happen.

35:50.434 --> 35:54.836
Hey, so why don't we check out the
cabins where Georgie will be staying?

35:54.871 --> 35:56.972
<i>Yeah, I'd really like that.</i>

35:57.040 --> 35:58.407
<i>But you haven't
met the horses yet.</i>

35:58.442 --> 36:00.008
Yeah, but you see,
Georgie is really particular

36:00.043 --> 36:02.210
about her sleeping arrangements.

36:06.915 --> 36:10.118
Hey! Hey you!

36:10.152 --> 36:11.652
<i>I thought you
got the message.</i>

36:11.720 --> 36:13.354
You're not welcome here.

36:13.389 --> 36:15.623
All right, let me explain.

36:15.691 --> 36:17.358
I was just collecting
some feed samples.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.059
No, you're trespassing
is what you're doing.

36:19.127 --> 36:20.760
Adele, go call the cops.

36:20.795 --> 36:22.829
Wait! Hold on a second.
Hold on! Hold on, okay?

36:22.897 --> 36:24.798
Look, I'm not trying to ruin
your business.

36:24.865 --> 36:26.666
I think I know what's poisoning
your horses.

36:26.701 --> 36:27.968
We run a riding camp!

36:28.035 --> 36:30.104
Why would we poison
our horses?

36:30.138 --> 36:32.206
Not on purpose, okay?

36:33.241 --> 36:37.110
This chicken feed,
it contains monensin

36:37.144 --> 36:38.877
it's that growth additive
that I was telling you about.

36:38.912 --> 36:40.079
Your horses are eating it.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.880
That's why they're dying.

36:41.915 --> 36:45.050
Yeah, and your
cred is like zero.

36:45.085 --> 36:46.919
All you have to do
is go online.

36:46.953 --> 36:48.954
Tell me about it.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.388
Do you guys have any idea

36:50.423 --> 36:52.324
what it's like to have your name
dragged through the mud?

36:52.358 --> 36:53.558
Horse killer.

36:53.593 --> 36:56.294
That's what they're calling me
on Facebook <i>and that Twitter.</i>

36:56.329 --> 36:57.462
Families we've known for years

36:57.530 --> 36:58.796
<i>have stopped sending</i>
<i>their kids here.</i>

36:58.831 --> 37:00.031
Once something
like that starts,

37:00.065 --> 37:02.134
you can't put the genie
back in the bottle.

37:02.168 --> 37:04.436
We just wanna help, okay?

37:04.470 --> 37:08.205
All you gotta do is move a few
bags of feed, clean up your barn,

37:08.240 --> 37:09.540
and keep your chickens away
from your horses

37:09.574 --> 37:11.509
and you can prevent
another horse from getting sick.

37:14.146 --> 37:15.379
Might be too late for that.

37:21.486 --> 37:23.219
His name's catwalk.

37:23.254 --> 37:24.954
Everyone's favourite.

37:24.988 --> 37:26.189
Yesterday,
he wouldn't touch his hay.

37:26.223 --> 37:28.625
Just not being himself.

37:28.659 --> 37:31.893
His heart rate is
through the roof right now.

37:31.927 --> 37:35.497
I keep walking him,
try to make him drink.

37:35.532 --> 37:37.232
Just figured it's colic.

37:37.267 --> 37:40.235
Yeah, well, monensin
poisoning has the same symptoms.

37:40.270 --> 37:43.472
We gotta get him to the clinic or
he might not make it till tomorrow.

37:43.506 --> 37:45.374
We can't let that
happen again.

37:45.408 --> 37:47.308
And we won't.

37:47.342 --> 37:50.678
Okay, let's go  Come on.

37:53.582 --> 37:54.649
Come on.

37:58.820 --> 38:00.388
How is he?

38:00.422 --> 38:02.455
He's good.
He's hanging in there.

38:03.658 --> 38:08.361
I have to say, I'm pretty
impressed with you right now.

38:08.429 --> 38:09.729
Well, don't be.

38:10.931 --> 38:13.366
Amy,
I gotta tell you something.

38:14.302 --> 38:15.902
I screwed up big time.

38:15.969 --> 38:17.404
What are you talking about?

38:17.471 --> 38:20.206
Your ring? I lost it.

38:20.273 --> 38:21.907
You lost it?

38:21.974 --> 38:23.775
You left it by the sink
in the kitchen that night

38:23.843 --> 38:26.612
and I put it in my jeans pocket
and then you washed my jeans.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.779
And I can't find it.

38:27.847 --> 38:28.947
I searched everywhere, Amy.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.049
I've looked everywhere.

38:33.386 --> 38:36.053
Is that what you and Jack
were doing the septic tank?

38:36.121 --> 38:38.523
Like I said, everywhere.

38:39.458 --> 38:44.662
So here I was breaking my back and the
ring was in your pocket the whole time?

38:44.730 --> 38:46.698
Well, it was.

38:46.765 --> 38:48.366
Now I'm gonna be saving up
for a new one.

38:48.434 --> 38:51.034
I guess you'll just have to
propose to me all over again.

38:51.102 --> 38:52.336
Well, you better say
yes the first time.

38:53.504 --> 38:55.205
Excuse me.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.840
Uh, hello? Hi.

38:58.743 --> 39:00.677
Real estate agent.

39:00.745 --> 39:03.012
Congratulations
on your new house.

39:03.080 --> 39:06.582
Oh, for your information, miss smarty
pants, she's not calling about a house.

39:06.650 --> 39:08.317
<i>What? No way.</i>

39:09.253 --> 39:11.053
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

39:11.121 --> 39:14.857
So they accepted the offer...

39:14.891 --> 39:17.192
And we just bought Maggie's!

39:17.261 --> 39:20.296
Congratulations!
That is so amazing!

39:20.330 --> 39:22.731
And just how do you plan
to manage all this?

39:22.765 --> 39:25.433
Hire good people,
stay out of the day-to-day.

39:25.468 --> 39:28.270
Yeah. We'll see how long
that lasts.

39:28.337 --> 39:29.904
So we don't have to move?

39:29.938 --> 39:31.773
<i>Ah, well, no.</i>

39:31.807 --> 39:34.876
No, for the time being, we're
gonna stay right where we are.

39:34.943 --> 39:38.512
We'll put the whole house hunting
thing on hold for now, I guess.

39:38.546 --> 39:42.182
Did I marry the right guy?
Am I lucky or what?

39:42.216 --> 39:44.117
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

39:44.152 --> 39:46.186
What's that supposed to mean?

39:46.220 --> 39:48.289
It means that...

39:50.091 --> 39:53.260
Everyone should be very proud
of you...

39:53.295 --> 39:55.461
Because Lou bought a diner!

39:55.496 --> 39:56.796
Let's have a toast to that!

39:56.863 --> 40:00.533
- I did! I absolutely did.
- Way to go, Lou!

40:00.567 --> 40:01.711
What have we done?

40:01.735 --> 40:03.536
I have no idea.

40:08.395 --> 40:10.530
<i>Pj's. What do you think?</i>

40:10.564 --> 40:11.764
Ice cream cones?

40:11.808 --> 40:13.241
- Mm-hm.
- No?

40:13.266 --> 40:16.100
How about elephants?
Do you like those?

40:16.135 --> 40:18.136
<i>- Mm-hm.
- No?</i>

40:18.170 --> 40:21.005
I usually let her
pick her own.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.974
Okay, go crazy.

40:23.909 --> 40:27.245
So, your new manager
starts tomorrow.

40:27.279 --> 40:28.947
That's great, Mallory.

40:28.981 --> 40:32.182
But you know being a manager,
it's a full-time job.

40:32.217 --> 40:33.551
Perfect.

40:33.585 --> 40:35.018
And I promised Peter
I'd be hands off.

40:35.053 --> 40:37.555
I need someone,
you know, long term.

40:37.589 --> 40:39.557
That's me.

40:39.624 --> 40:41.892
But, Mallory, what if you decide
to go to school in the fall?

40:41.926 --> 40:43.227
It's not gonna happen.

40:43.261 --> 40:44.628
But what if it does?

40:44.663 --> 40:46.697
I need someone
I can trust one hundred percent

40:46.765 --> 40:48.865
to take care
of absolutely everything.

40:48.899 --> 40:50.600
Someone like me.

40:50.668 --> 40:53.269
The same someone
who talked to the mayor.

40:53.303 --> 40:56.673
Zoning change denied.
Heritage site done.

40:56.707 --> 40:58.408
Wait... that was you?

40:58.442 --> 41:01.344
Yeah. It was the hardest thing
I've ever done,

41:01.379 --> 41:05.247
but if that doesn't prove
that I'm committed...

41:05.281 --> 41:09.284
What you did was amazing and
I can't thank you enough.

41:09.352 --> 41:12.521
But, you know, commitment
is only part of it.

41:12.589 --> 41:19.327
Being a manger is a huge job and for
someone who's only waitressed part-time,

41:19.362 --> 41:21.596
I just-
I don't think you're ready.

41:21.630 --> 41:25.500
Hey. I just
wanted to say congrats

41:25.534 --> 41:27.702
and you're crazy...

41:27.736 --> 41:28.803
And good luck.

41:28.837 --> 41:30.405
Thanks, I think.

41:30.439 --> 41:32.072
Good night, Katie.

41:33.041 --> 41:34.575
Picking out your own pajamas.

41:34.610 --> 41:36.109
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:36.176 --> 41:38.278
What's that?

41:38.345 --> 41:40.046
What you got there?

41:41.015 --> 41:42.215
Oh...

41:47.755 --> 41:50.957
<i>Katie, you found the ring,</i>
<i>honey!</i>

41:51.025 --> 41:52.391
Good girl.

41:56.596 --> 41:58.330
You know,
I talked to Scott today.

41:58.398 --> 41:59.932
He says the horses
are doing really well.

41:59.999 --> 42:02.601
Oh, good, that's a relief.

42:02.636 --> 42:04.437
Hey, you wanna know
what else is a relief?

42:04.504 --> 42:06.806
What's that?

42:06.840 --> 42:08.473
You found it!
Where did you find it?!

42:08.541 --> 42:11.142
Actually, Katie found it.

42:13.412 --> 42:15.480
Amy...

42:16.649 --> 42:19.651
I want you know that...

42:19.718 --> 42:21.886
Ring or no ring,

42:21.954 --> 42:26.122
I will always be there for you
and I will always love you.

42:26.190 --> 42:27.558
I'll always love you too.

42:31.395 --> 42:32.663
What?

42:32.697 --> 42:34.631
Uh...

42:35.567 --> 42:39.202
I guess I was just hoping
that you would propose again.
