00:05.773 --> 00:07.575
[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.608 --> 00:09.277
[woman] Coach Belov,
speaking of Worlds,

00:09.310 --> 00:11.579
who's taking Emily Kmetko's
spot now that she's quit?

00:11.612 --> 00:14.715
- Kelly Parker.
- [Kaylie] Sasha, I am ready.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.217
You've been out
for six weeks, Kaylie.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.651
If I don't compete at Worlds,

00:17.685 --> 00:19.720
the NGO won't even consider
me for the Olympic Team.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.122
[Payson] I don't know
what you want.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.191
I want you to know that
it's you I'm interested in,

00:23.224 --> 00:25.759
- not Lauren.
- I just can't do it.

00:25.793 --> 00:26.627
What are you doing?

00:26.660 --> 00:29.230
What you should've done
a long time ago.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.608
Three miles.
Not bad for a girl.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.643
Free to run ahead if my
pace is holding you back.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.145
Nah, that's OK.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.114
A nice easy run is
good once in a while.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.248
How about sprints?

00:47.281 --> 00:48.616
I'll race you to
the picnic tables.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.124
How did you get
here so fast?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.591
What? Can't believe
you were beat by a girl?

00:57.625 --> 00:59.560
[panting] Stop, you're
gonna give me a complex.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.262
All right, fine.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.431
I took a shortcut
at that bend in the trail.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.565
- That's not fair.
- Yes, it is.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.600
I just told you I'd
race you to the picnic tables.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.302
You're the dummy
that took the long way.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.803
All right,
I'll give it to you.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.440
But I am the victim
of a shady technicality.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.777
Hey, what's up
there buddy?

01:16.810 --> 01:19.380
Oh, hey, why are you so dirty?
Isn't anyone taking care of you?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.549
[Max] Looks like he's
been lost for a while.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.518
You and your gender issues.
Your little buddy is a she.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.187
[barks]

01:26.220 --> 01:28.522
[barking continues]

01:30.491 --> 01:32.693
[upbeat rock music playing]

01:42.270 --> 01:43.271
[woman]
No, no, no, higher.

01:43.304 --> 01:44.438
All right, my handsomes,
listen to me.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.474
We're gonna go straight up,
in the center,

01:46.507 --> 01:48.576
above the other sign.
And can you just even it out?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.511
Bring that down there.
No, no, no...

01:50.544 --> 01:53.481
Excuse me. Who are you?
And what are you doing?

01:53.514 --> 01:56.217
I am Kelly Parker's manager,
and I'm busy.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.219
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Kim Keeler.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.354
I'm manager of The Rock.
Is this your bus?

02:00.388 --> 02:02.623
This is my office.
I'm also head of KPE.

02:02.656 --> 02:06.660
- KPE?
- Yeah, Kelly Parker
Enterprises.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.696
Well, you cannot
park your office here.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.498
This is our entire parking lot.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.634
And that banner has
to come down until
Sasha approves it.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.603
All right, calm down.
Hold the work, boys.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.806
Someone has
control issues. Whoo.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.545
Morning, Sasha.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.314
I hope you've had
your coffee.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.749
- Sasha, this is...
- Sheila Baboyon.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.751
Two b's one
n. Nice to meet you.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.520
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Sheila is Kelly Parker's

02:32.553 --> 02:35.289
manager, and she's
apparently moving in.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.825
Listen, Sasha, Kelly
has graciously agreed

02:37.858 --> 02:41.262
to do her pre-World training
here at The Rock, right?

02:41.295 --> 02:43.864
So, her fans have the right
to know. Am I right?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.899
Come on, she's former
National Champion.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.701
She's gold medalist
at Worlds.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.438
I would think that your gym
would be honored
to have her banner

02:50.471 --> 02:52.773
above your
entrance, right?

02:52.806 --> 02:55.743
Plus, it ups
your cred big time.
Am I right, Sasha?

02:55.776 --> 02:58.512
I think it's best
we hold your banner

02:58.546 --> 03:00.781
until we all discuss
where best to put it.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.551
You know what?
Why don't we let Mrs. Baboyon...

03:03.584 --> 03:05.253
Baboyon.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.554
...hang Kelly's banner
wherever she likes?

03:06.587 --> 03:07.855
I mean, it's just
a banner after all.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.359
It's just a banner
after all. Thank you, sir.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.266
Oh, why did
you cave so fast?

03:18.299 --> 03:19.500
If you let them get
a few jabs in early,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.769
they don't expect the left hook.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.871
Am I right?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.773
[Max] I'll take her
to the vet after practice.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.641
They'll be able to tell us
if she has an ID chip.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.610
But we can't take her
into the gym.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.779
If the girls see a puppy,
they'll all turn into
little kids

03:31.812 --> 03:34.548
and want to play with her.
Sasha will go through the roof.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.517
Yeah, you're right. It'll
totally disrupt practice.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.920
This close to Worlds, Coach
is a little more than uptight.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.589
So, what are we gonna do
with our little runaway?

03:41.622 --> 03:44.458
[whimpering]

03:45.793 --> 03:48.529
[up-tempo electronic
music playing]

03:50.598 --> 03:52.933
The Kelly Parker Circus
is in town.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.370
Did you see that bus?
And how about that
Godzilla of a manager?

03:56.404 --> 03:59.473
Nope, I'm not going to waste
my energy worrying about KP.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.774
I'm trying to get
back in shape

04:00.808 --> 04:02.810
to land a spot
on the World Team.

04:02.843 --> 04:06.514
What's with that banner?
The Rock isn't even your gym.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.616
I mean, I don't even
have a banner here.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.217
I'm the only girl
on the National Team

04:10.250 --> 04:11.519
who's ever competed
in a World Championship.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.988
Been there, won that.
So, guess what? I get a banner.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.925
Plus, I'm also the only
former National Champ
on the World Team.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.227
Yeah? Well, when Kaylie
wins her spot back,

04:20.260 --> 04:21.762
the current National Champ
will be on the World Team.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.731
Lauren, keep me out of this.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.299
Just saying,
current trumps has-been.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.601
Aw, and it looks like
someone's a little jealous.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.303
But who can blame you, Lauren?

04:29.337 --> 04:30.771
You're a never-was
in the gymnastics world,

04:30.804 --> 04:33.607
and a has-been when
it comes to Carter.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.377
[scoffs] I could care less
about Carter. I'm with Max now.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.279
- Officially.
- Since when?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.252
[Kelly]
Has...

04:45.285 --> 04:47.621
...anyone told Max
about this official ruling?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.256
'Cause it looks like
he's in the dark,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.625
with someone else.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.627
I mean, dogs are den
creatures by nature.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.729
It's like a super
size dog crate.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.566
And we'll take turns
in watering her,
and feeding her,

04:58.599 --> 04:59.900
and walking her.
She's going to be fine.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.003
OK. And, remember,
not a word to anybody.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.639
- Anybody.
- All right.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.309
And they look pretty
darn chummy to me.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.780
World Team girls, to the mat.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.586
OK, girls.

05:18.619 --> 05:23.457
As you know, there is only one
spot left on the World Team.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.892
The three contenders
are Annie Dillon,

05:24.925 --> 05:26.927
Tessa Grande,
and Kaylie Cruz.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.897
[cheers]

05:29.930 --> 05:32.500
Now, at the end of this week,
I will hold a mini-meet

05:32.533 --> 05:35.703
where they will compete on
floor, beam, bars, and vault.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.671
The girl who proves
she has what it takes

05:37.705 --> 05:40.474
for the USA to win at Worlds
will join us in Rio.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.743
So, good luck to all of you.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.645
[chuckling] Yeah!

05:44.678 --> 05:46.647
[both giggling]

05:50.718 --> 05:52.586
[scoffs] Get her.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.789
Acting as if Tessa
has it in the bag.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.591
If Tessa gets the last spot,

05:57.625 --> 05:59.427
Kelly will be
team captain for sure.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.596
That's gonna happen.
Don't let KP mess
with your head.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.098
You're gonna blow
Tessa away.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.936
Yeah... definitely.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.872
[Kelly] I'm telling you,
Kaylie Cruz is history.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.608
There's no way
she's going to be ready
on all four events by Friday.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.109
Oh, really?

06:16.143 --> 06:18.679
Well, how about that Sasha
is her coach, dumb-dumb?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.682
You actually think that
he's going to be impartial? No.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.017
- Right.
- This isn't good.
You literally cannot

06:24.051 --> 06:26.554
afford to share the
spotlight with this girl.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.821
I mean, look at her.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.891
She's beautiful.
She's a champ.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.993
The sponsors love her.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.529
There is a lot of really
big money at stake here.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.930
And you know that it's been

06:36.964 --> 06:41.134
a long dry spell since you let
her beat you at Nationals.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.437
- [sighing] Can't you...?
- No, I can't. I can't.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.606
I can't keep trying to
sell yesterday's champion

06:45.639 --> 06:47.908
to the sponsors anymore.
Do you understand?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.143
- Yeah, I got it.
- But do you really?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.912
Yes, I got it. You've told me
this a thousand times.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.581
Well, then maybe
try listening.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.583
Show me that
you're listening.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.417
And you have to make sure
that Tessa is on her game

06:57.451 --> 06:58.586
to beat this girl.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.954
Then you just do
what you do best.

07:00.988 --> 07:04.858
You psych that airhead
Kaylie Cruz out, huh?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.694
I'll do whatever it takes

07:06.727 --> 07:09.763
to make sure Kaylie's
out of the picture.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.699
OK.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.803
You know why I'm
hard on you, right?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.939
Right? It's for
your own good. All right.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.974
[sighing] I know, Mom.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.616
[theme music playing]

07:52.873 --> 07:56.577
So, what's the deal
with you and Payson?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.878
We're just friends.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.148
And... what are we?

08:01.181 --> 08:02.683
I'm not sure.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.217
Still?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.954
You kissed me.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.622
I... think it was
you who kissed me.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.692
Yeah, but you kissed back.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.995
Yeah, I guess I did.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.464
So?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.534
So... Your strawberry
lip-gloss is pretty tasty.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.245
I wonder why Sasha's
for the final spot so soon?

08:32.279 --> 08:35.515
You'd think he'd give you
more time to get into shape.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.184
He must have
confidence in me.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.624
Does he? Or is it
that he won't look
like the bad guy

08:43.657 --> 08:47.194
when you choke on Friday
and he has to pick Tessa?

08:56.737 --> 08:59.306
Oops. Didn't mean
to distract you.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.814
Whatever she said,
shake it off.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.281
Yeah, I already have.

09:08.315 --> 09:12.052
Really?
It doesn't look like it.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.888
I just didn't think I'd have
to fight for my spot

09:14.922 --> 09:16.289
on the World Team so soon.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.259
You'll be ready.
and work with you if you want.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.094
No more secret practices.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.764
Sasha was totally pissed
about that last time, remember?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.172
- [dog whimpering]
- Say your good-byes.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.207
If the vet finds a chip
in her, then this may be it.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.344
I've fallen completely
in love with this dog.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.959
Hey, Payson!

09:51.992 --> 09:54.261
Spruce Juice for some
smoothies and girl talk?

09:54.294 --> 09:56.596
- My treat.
- I've really got
to get back home.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.799
My dad just came
in from Minnesota.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.969
That long-distance thing must
be tough for your parents, huh?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.904
It's hard on all of us.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.239
He must get so
lonely in Minnesota.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.608
Do you ever wonder if
your father is unfaithful?

10:08.642 --> 10:13.080
My father would never
cheat on my mother. Never.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.250
[funk music playing]

10:34.668 --> 10:36.970
Excuse me, sir?
Did you order the scotch?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.208
- Chloe?
- Mark?

10:43.643 --> 10:47.915
- [Mark] Anybody home?
- Daddy!

10:47.948 --> 10:50.217
Hey. How's my girl been?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.886
Missing you
like crazy, mostly.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.155
[sing-songy] Hello.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.226
So, why don't you
go find your sister?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.728
I bet your
dad's starving.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.062
I'll leave you two alone

11:02.095 --> 11:04.231
so you can smooch
in private.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.335
So, when are we going
to tell them?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.838
I don't want to spoil dinner.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.206
You weren't fired, Mark.
Your company went under.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.208
I know, but I still don't want
to get their hopes up

11:15.242 --> 11:17.845
and tell them I'm looking
for a job in Boulder

11:17.878 --> 11:19.279
until I know I got it.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.781
Well, how'd
the interview go?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.350
Guess where they wanted
to finish the meeting.

11:23.383 --> 11:27.320
- Bodacious Boulders.
- That sleazy strip bar thing?

11:27.354 --> 11:31.091
Yeah. They said they're
looking for a guy who likes
to work hard and party harder.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.360
We don't really want to
work for a bunch of guys

11:33.393 --> 11:36.063
who hang out
at Bodacious Boulders.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.664
We don't have really
much of a choice.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.200
We're still in debt a hundred
g's from Payson's surgery,

11:40.233 --> 11:41.301
we owe more on this house
than it's worth,

11:41.334 --> 11:43.036
and our savings are
all but depleted.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.173
[sighing] Well, I guess you
gotta do what you gotta do.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.142
A lot of people gotta do
what they gotta do.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.044
Guess who's working
at Bodacious Boulders?

11:51.078 --> 11:54.047
- Who?
- Chloe Kmetko.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.185
Austin.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.122
Sorry to bother
you so late.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.256
But I wanted to ask
your permission

12:03.290 --> 12:05.325
to work with Kaylie
after hours.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.427
I think we've already
covered this topic,

12:07.460 --> 12:10.197
- and the answer's no.
- Sasha.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.333
I'm sure as the
World Team coach,
you don't want to seem

12:13.366 --> 12:16.103
like you're giving
preferential treatment
to any of the Rock girls.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.771
Kaylie really needs
the extra help.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.473
There are other concerns with
Kaylie that I can't go into.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.776
Like her anorexia?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.478
You know about that?

12:25.512 --> 12:28.215
I was the first person to say
anything to her about it.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.184
My sister struggled
with an ED,

12:31.218 --> 12:32.886
so I'm aware of
all the danger signs.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.923
I promise to make sure
that Kaylie trains healthy.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.359
OK.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.195
But I want to know exactly
what you're working on

12:42.229 --> 12:43.864
and any issues that come up.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.498
And I don't want any surprises.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.972
No, it's all right.
I'm coming out.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.174
- My parents are in bed.
- [Max over phone] OK.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.909
[dog whimpering]

12:57.077 --> 12:59.346
[dog yelps]

12:59.379 --> 13:00.981
[whispering]
I got her groomed.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.383
She put this little
bow in her hair.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.919
I don't think she likes it
too much, but...

13:05.953 --> 13:07.487
...she got a clean
bill of health at the vet.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.222
No chip though.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.992
Someone's gotta be looking
for her, don't you think?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.793
I can't believe
she was just abandoned.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.328
I know.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.097
I'll keep her in my room
tonight, I think,

13:17.130 --> 13:18.431
and then tomorrow,
we should

13:18.465 --> 13:20.300
go around the running
trail and put up signs.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.236
Wish I could keep you,
but my mom would just kill me.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.173
I was always bringing
strays home as a kid.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.009
There's just something about
a stray dog that gets me.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.778
I know. I used to volunteer
at a shelter.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.014
- [dog whining]
- Come here, doggy.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.083
Let me get that stupid bow
out of your hair.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.818
Feels so weird just
calling her "doggy."

13:38.852 --> 13:41.488
Yeah, I sort of already
gave her a name.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.257
- What?
- Phoebe?

13:44.291 --> 13:47.794
No way. I used to have
a goldfish named Phoebe.
Phoebe Fish.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.996
[dog barks]

13:49.029 --> 13:50.931
Oh, you like that name?
Phoebe?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.133
- [barks]
- Shh. Shh.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.074
[upbeat rock music playing]

14:08.949 --> 14:11.985
Good news.
I spoke with Sasha last night,

14:12.019 --> 14:13.853
and he gave me permission
to work with you after hours.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.256
Seriously?

14:16.289 --> 14:19.859
I was expecting
more along the lines of

14:19.893 --> 14:21.895
"Thank you, Austin."
You need the help...

14:21.929 --> 14:23.863
I need you to stop
rushing to my rescue.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.133
I'm tired of being treated
like the tragic sick girl.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.401
I was just trying to help you.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.238
Look, if this is your way
of going back in time
and saving your sister,

14:31.271 --> 14:33.440
you gotta deal with this
in your therapist's office,

14:33.473 --> 14:35.142
not by making me
your little project.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.082
[sighing]

14:43.350 --> 14:45.318
It's nice that you want
to be there for Kaylie,

14:45.352 --> 14:48.155
even though she doesn't really
seem to appreciate it much.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.091
But then some guys are turned on
by girls who need saving.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.492
I'm not saving
anybody, OK?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.194
Kaylie's doing
just fine on her own.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.462
Come on.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.931
We both know she won't be
ready on all four events.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.266
If you really
want to help her,

14:59.299 --> 15:02.469
you convince her to drop out now
before she humiliates herself.

15:02.502 --> 15:07.574
Why don't you go back
to training your little
boot-licker, Tessa.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.142
We'll see who
wins on Friday.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.480
Why haven't you and Summer
set a date for the wedding yet?

15:13.513 --> 15:17.650
We can't hire caterers
or a wedding planner
until we have a solid date.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.988
I don't think Summer wants
a huge wedding, Lauren.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.323
And, besides,
we're not in any rush.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.398
What is she doing here?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.066
She should be in Vegas
with Emily.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.969
Hello. Her daughter
is having a baby.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.405
She can't
just up and leave.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.040
She has Brian
to think of.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.942
Yeah, but what's she still
hanging on to here? You?

15:42.976 --> 15:45.545
I doubt that.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.914
I wanted to come by
and settle up

15:47.947 --> 15:50.383
Emily's Rock dues
from last month, anyway.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.684
Oh, Chloe, that's not necessary.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.286
Summer, I want to.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.589
I know you think
that I'm a terrible,

15:56.623 --> 15:58.258
irresponsible mother.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.162
I got pregnant
at 17, and...

16:02.195 --> 16:04.297
...now my daughter's
following in my footsteps.

16:04.331 --> 16:07.700
Actually, I admire Emily's
choice to keep the baby.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.070
Well, I want more for her.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.507
I know my best wasn't good
enough but I tried, Summer.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.943
I really tried.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.112
Chloe, I don't think
you're a bad mother.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.348
I see the way
you look at Emily.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.250
And you love her.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.719
And I know that she'll
follow in your footsteps

16:26.753 --> 16:30.957
and become a loving, caring
and devoted mother, too.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.160
And that's a beautiful life.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.262
A beautiful, hard life.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.666
You know, there are
other options

16:39.699 --> 16:44.137
if Emily doesn't feel
ready to be a mother.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.605
There are
open adoptions.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.441
It's something to consider.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.214
You know, this place just
isn't going to be the same

16:54.247 --> 16:55.982
without the Kmetko family.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.586
This is a big loss
for The Rock.

16:59.619 --> 17:03.656
Yeah, it's a... big loss
for me and Emily, too.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.527
It was more than
just a gym, you know?

17:07.560 --> 17:11.631
It was like a small town,
and I really loved...

17:11.664 --> 17:13.366
being a part of it.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.678
It's a beautiful ring
by the way, Summer.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.682
Congratulations,
on getting engaged.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.153
I hope that you and Steve
will be really...

17:33.186 --> 17:35.322
happy together.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.796
Hey, what's up?

17:43.830 --> 17:45.598
Ready to sneak our girl out
of here and head to the park?

17:45.632 --> 17:47.400
Totally. Let's go.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.436
Hey, guys!

17:49.469 --> 17:52.038
Where are you two off to?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.773
- Running.
- See ya.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.677
[sighs]

17:58.345 --> 17:59.712
[rock music plays]

18:05.752 --> 18:07.320
You're really working
that pommel horse, huh?

18:07.354 --> 18:08.788
My favorite form of therapy.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.660
Yeah, about that.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.763
I was out of line with that
comment about your sister.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.832
I snapped at you because
I'm stressing really heavy.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.368
It happens.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.804
It's healthier to get that
stuff out than to keep it in.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.840
But I promise you, I don't
think of you as my sister.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.744
[sighing] I'm just scared.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.247
I have two days left,
and I don't think

18:34.281 --> 18:36.683
I can be ready to compete
on all four apparatuses.

18:36.716 --> 18:40.220
You're right.
You won't be.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.723
What? If you don't think
I can make the World Team,

18:43.756 --> 18:45.425
why did you ask Sasha
if you could help me?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.795
Because you won't be competing
on all four apparatuses.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.397
You'll only be competing on one.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.333
What are you talking about?

18:53.366 --> 18:54.534
Think about it.

18:54.567 --> 18:58.505
Sasha wants a Team USA win.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.608
With Emily gone, where is
the team's weakest link?

19:01.641 --> 19:05.745
Vault? I mean, it was her vault
that got her on the World Team.

19:05.778 --> 19:09.115
That's right, and now
it's the one position

19:09.148 --> 19:10.717
Sasha doesn't have a star on.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.820
In order for USA to win,
they need to medal
in every event.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.223
If your vault is
strong enough,

19:16.256 --> 19:18.658
Sasha has no choice but to take
you as his ringer on vault.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.127
Yeah, but, Austin,
it's my weakest event.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.263
Not if we work together
to make it your strongest.

19:23.296 --> 19:27.800
Sasha asked for all apparatuses.
He'll never go for this.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.602
That's why we won't tell him.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.703
Are you crazy?

19:30.737 --> 19:33.740
It's a gamble, Kaylie,
I admit it.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.246
But what have
you got to lose?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.682
Other than everything?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.295
Lauren knew we were
up to something.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.629
She could smell it.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.665
She probably thinks we're off
somewhere fooling around.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.268
She can't believe
we're just friends.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.336
Some friends do come
with benefits.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.505
What, like a health plan?

20:05.538 --> 20:06.639
You know what I mean.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.709
Yeah, I know what
you mean and...

20:09.742 --> 20:13.280
I know. You're not looking
for that kind of friend.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.681
But what if I am?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.716
I'm not offering any
benefits right now.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.818
If that's what you're looking
for, then stick with Lauren.

20:18.851 --> 20:22.689
I don't have the same
connection with her
as I have with you.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.792
Look, I know you made it
clear that you only want
to be buddies, but...

20:25.825 --> 20:28.795
...I was just wondering
if you ever think you
might change your mind?

20:28.828 --> 20:31.731
Honestly, Max?
I just don't see it.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.633
You know how focused
I am on my goal.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.235
I know. It's one of the
things I like about you.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.771
You have this clarity, this
passion for what you love.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.473
And I can't jeopardize that.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.310
So it wouldn't bother you
if I dated other girls?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.846
Why would it bother me?

20:46.879 --> 20:48.948
I guess that's my answer.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.584
[Phoebe whimpers]

20:51.618 --> 20:53.920
Part of me secretly hopes
that nobody claims Phoebe.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.524
Me too. I'm going
to ask Austin tonight
if I can keep her.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.758
Maybe we can share
custody rights?

20:58.791 --> 21:02.462
I think I'd need alimony.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.497
[electronic music plays]

21:19.546 --> 21:22.815
That was good.
It's really good.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.751
But good isn't bad-ass is it?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.754
No. And for this to work,
you have to be.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.255
You need to add
something amazing.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.758
Something
Worlds-worthy.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.660
You could put it over the top
if you throw a twist

21:33.693 --> 21:35.895
into your Yurchenko double
and make it a two-and-a-half.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.264
[stammering] Austin,
I don't have that skill.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.533
You will if you spend
all your time working
with me on it.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.769
[panting] You know,
I'm having second thoughts

21:42.802 --> 21:44.537
about this whole strategy.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.774
I'm risking everything
on one vault, one twist.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.042
And that one twist will make
all the difference.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.614
I know you can do this.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.785
Why can't you let me in,
let me help you?

21:58.818 --> 22:02.088
[sighing] I don't know,
I just...

22:03.456 --> 22:05.825
I want to help you, Kaylie.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.594
You are not in this alone.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.731
Why are you working so hard
to help me get this?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.766
I don't know.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.705
It's like something inside me
wants the best for you.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.641
There is something
about you

22:21.674 --> 22:23.075
that makes me
pay attention

22:23.109 --> 22:25.445
to everything little
thing you do.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.947
I just... want you to be happy.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.987
You ready to go bad-ass, Cruz?

22:42.629 --> 22:43.996
[Payson] Well,
that looks obvious.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.433
We've got to sneak her up
to the equipment cage

22:46.466 --> 22:48.568
before anyone sees this
huge bulge in my jacket.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.102
I have to say, she does
look awfully comfy

22:50.136 --> 22:51.638
all snuggled up
next to her daddy.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.441
Oh, and bad news.
Austin's allergic to dogs.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.610
So we won't be able
to keep her at our place
if we can't find the owner.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.846
Well, then I'll just
have to take her home
with me after practice

22:59.879 --> 23:01.981
and beg my parents
to let me keep her.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.783
What's one more
mouth to feed?

23:03.816 --> 23:04.817
[Mark] OK.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.855
- Sure, thanks.
- [phone beeps]

23:10.790 --> 23:12.725
You didn't get it,
did you?

23:12.759 --> 23:14.894
[sighing] Did you really want me
to work with a bunch of guys

23:14.927 --> 23:16.596
who take lunch
at a strip bar?

23:16.629 --> 23:20.667
- I know I didn't.
- No, I didn't.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.735
What now?

23:22.769 --> 23:26.138
Well, I... work my contacts
back in Minnesota, or...

23:26.172 --> 23:29.075
...start here in Boulder
from the ground floor.

23:29.108 --> 23:34.146
I hate us being apart,
believe me.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.650
But is a starting
position here

23:37.684 --> 23:39.686
going to pay enough
for us to live on,

23:39.719 --> 23:42.855
and support
the girls' gymnastics?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.726
I'm scared, Mark.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.730
Yeah, me too.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.704
Hey, I see you're only
working on vault today.
Shouldn't you rotate?

23:57.737 --> 24:00.006
I need to fine-tune my vault.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.841
How are the other
routines coming?

24:01.874 --> 24:03.743
[Austin]
She's doing great.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.914
Sasha said that Austin
could help me prepare
for the mini-meet.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.682
Well, I guess that's only fair,

24:09.716 --> 24:12.451
considering that Kelly
is acting like she's
Tessa's personal coach.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.722
And I hear she just got
a round off layout,
layout mount on beam.

24:15.755 --> 24:16.923
She what?

24:16.956 --> 24:19.726
But... I mean,
don't worry about it.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.161
She's young, and her
nerves will get to her.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.996
You're way more
experienced all around.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.644
Small emergency.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.745
Something wrong
with Phoebe?

24:38.778 --> 24:41.213
No, she's fine.
But I took her on a little walk

24:41.247 --> 24:43.482
and when we got back
up to the equipment cage,

24:43.516 --> 24:45.084
the janitor was in there
cleaning it.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.786
So, where is she?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.120
I hid her in
the men's locker room.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.657
Don't worry, I'm going
to sneak her back up
to the equipment cage

24:50.690 --> 24:53.092
- soon as the coast is clear.
- [Payson] OK.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.596
Looks like Max chose
the jock over the slut.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.064
Do you ever
get exhausted

24:58.097 --> 25:00.700
by the endless vomit of lies
that pour out of your mouth?

25:00.733 --> 25:01.768
I only know what
Carter told me.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.103
And what exactly did
Carter tell you?

25:04.136 --> 25:06.706
Plenty.
And a word of advice?

25:06.739 --> 25:08.074
They stick around
a lot longer

25:08.107 --> 25:11.010
if you save the dessert
until after dinner.

25:22.622 --> 25:25.057
I figured out what's going on
between you and Sporty Spice.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.193
Payson and I
are just friends.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.596
But you like a little muscle
and sweat in your sugar.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.865
I admit to respecting
a serious jock-ette.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.667
Then, how about
a little one-on-one?

25:34.701 --> 25:36.535
Are we talking basketball or...

25:36.569 --> 25:38.838
Get your head
out of the gutter.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.874
Yes, basketball.
Six-ish?

25:41.908 --> 25:44.744
The public court
at Chautauqua Park?

25:44.777 --> 25:50.182
Unless you're afraid
that your male ego can't
take being beaten by a girl.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.984
- You're on.
- [dog barks]

25:56.623 --> 25:57.757
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

25:57.790 --> 25:59.558
- [chattering]
- [dog barking]

25:59.592 --> 26:01.193
Oh, it's so cute!

26:01.227 --> 26:02.528
Whose dog is that?

26:02.561 --> 26:03.830
[both] Mine!

26:03.863 --> 26:05.531
[both] Ours!

26:05.564 --> 26:09.802
What? They have
a dog together now?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.040
[Payton] She doesn't have
an identification chip

26:14.073 --> 26:15.675
and we put up fliers
everywhere,

26:15.708 --> 26:17.777
but nobody's claimed her.
And to be perfectly honest,

26:17.810 --> 26:20.713
I've fallen completely
in love with her. So...

26:20.747 --> 26:22.114
...can we keep her?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.719
Payson, there is
absolutely no way

26:26.753 --> 26:29.321
we can deal with
a dog right now.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.290
I can't believe you
would even consider it.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.093
I know it's been hard paying
the bills and getting by

26:34.126 --> 26:35.862
with what Dad makes
in Minnesota,
but I promise,

26:35.895 --> 26:38.731
I will do my part.
I'll share my room with her.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.199
I'll share my food with her.

26:40.232 --> 26:43.736
I'll take her for a walk
everyday. Please? Dad?

26:43.770 --> 26:46.873
I'm sorry, honey,
your mom's right.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.207
Maybe Max can keep her.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.776
He can't.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.578
[Kim] Well neither can we.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.681
You guys are gonna
have to give her up.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.748
I'm sorry, Payson.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.163
I wasn't sure you'd come.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.705
I said I was coming, didn't I?

27:18.738 --> 27:24.677
Yeah, but after all that
doggy drama with Payson,

27:24.711 --> 27:26.278
I thought you might have
forgotten about me.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.147
I told you, Payson and I
are just friends.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.718
Right. So, are you ready?

27:34.086 --> 27:35.888
Shirts or skins?

27:35.922 --> 27:40.760
I'll be shirts this game.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.776
Bring it in.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.980
You sure you want
to give me that advantage?

28:01.013 --> 28:03.215
You don't know who
you're up against.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.120
[phone ringing]

28:33.212 --> 28:35.347
[rock music plays]

28:44.023 --> 28:46.158
- [Max] You're good.
- I play to win.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.996
Clearly.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.230
Payson's not the only
jock at The Rock.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.900
I had to do something
to get your attention.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.270
Well, you got it.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.392
That's...

29:20.426 --> 29:21.260
...a personal foul.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.231
If you want a more physical
game, then I want to go legit.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.400
No more kissy kissy
until we go on a date.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.169
- Isn't this a date?
- No.

29:30.202 --> 29:33.339
A date is what happens after
you ask me out and I say yes.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.344
[up-tempo music plays]

29:42.348 --> 29:44.316
[groans]

29:57.029 --> 30:00.867
- You OK?
- Yeah.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.071
I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.339
I heard you two were
coming in for some
late night sessions,

30:07.373 --> 30:10.809
so I thought why not bring Tessa
in for a little extra training.

30:10.843 --> 30:13.312
Although, it looks like
my coaching style's

30:13.345 --> 30:15.247
a little different
than yours, Austin.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.854
Don't engage her.
That's exactly
what she wants.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.323
You just walk to the end
of that vault run,

30:24.356 --> 30:26.859
clear your head
of everything else
and think:

30:26.893 --> 30:30.262
"I can do this."

30:39.939 --> 30:41.207
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.275
Sorry I missed
your call last night.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.810
You sounded really upset.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.379
My parents totally
freaked out about Phoebe.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.981
They let me keep
her last night,

30:49.015 --> 30:51.217
but they said I have to take her
to a shelter after practice.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.851
That sucks.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.254
Someone will
adopt her, right?

30:55.287 --> 30:58.290
We couldn't possibly be
the only two who think
she's irresistible.

30:58.324 --> 31:01.293
Aw, hey, she's
a little superstar.

31:01.327 --> 31:05.364
Someone else will
want her for sure.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.066
[Sheila] If Cruz makes
World Team, we're screwed.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.035
She's gonna be a magnet
or all the money

31:09.068 --> 31:10.469
and endorsements
that you need to score.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.105
Kaylie's been busting her butt
trying to land a Yurchenko

31:13.139 --> 31:14.373
two-and-a-half
for the last two days.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.308
There's no way she's
going to be ready

31:16.342 --> 31:19.145
to compete with Tessa
on floor, bars, and beam.

31:19.178 --> 31:22.148
- You sure?
- Trust me, Mom.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.150
Tessa's in, Kaylie's out,

31:24.183 --> 31:29.221
[sighs] and I'm the next
captain of the US Team.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.889
How you feeling?

31:30.923 --> 31:33.292
- [inhales] Nervous.
- Don't be.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.227
All you have to do
is show Sasha clean routines

31:35.261 --> 31:36.562
on all four events
and you're in.

31:36.595 --> 31:42.034
Except, um, I'm not
doing all four events.

31:42.068 --> 31:45.104
I'm...
only doing vault.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.907
What? Is Sasha cool
with this?

31:48.941 --> 31:52.278
We haven't told him yet.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.446
OK, now I'm nervous.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.083
OK, gather round.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.484
Three girls are competing

31:58.517 --> 32:00.119
for the final spot
on the World Team.

32:00.152 --> 32:03.990
So let's hear it for
Kaylie Cruz, Tessa Grande,

32:04.023 --> 32:05.324
and Annie Dillon.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.062
[Sasha] All right,
Let the games begin!

32:10.096 --> 32:11.430
Tessa, let's see
what you've got.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.299
Come on,
Tessa, kill it.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.304
[slow tempo rock music plays]

32:37.389 --> 32:39.391
[applause]

32:42.294 --> 32:45.597
Wow, Sasha, did you see
that round off layout, layout?

32:52.404 --> 32:54.440
- [man] You can do it!
- [woman] You got this, Annie.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.280
[applause]

33:16.095 --> 33:17.529
All right, Tessa!
Let's hear it!

33:22.734 --> 33:24.603
OK, Kaylie, you're up.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.405
Let's see you on beam.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.143
[clears throat] Sasha?

33:32.478 --> 33:35.381
- I'm not doing beam.
- You're not doing beam?

33:37.316 --> 33:40.552
Uh, OK, let's, uh...
Let's see your bars then.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.488
I'm not doing bars.

33:42.521 --> 33:46.725
Uh, well, what you better start
doing is some explaining.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.761
I'm not doing
four events.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.399
I'm only showing
my vault today.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.067
Trust me, it's all
you need to see.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.036
And this is your doing?

33:58.070 --> 34:00.506
- I thought I said no surprises.
- It's not a surprise.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.375
It's a strategy.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.043
What are they talking about?

34:05.077 --> 34:07.746
- Kaylie's only doing vault.
- What? No way!

34:07.779 --> 34:10.449
And you willingly signed on
for this risk, Kaylie?

34:12.418 --> 34:13.319
Well, may I ask why?

34:16.122 --> 34:18.023
I just asked myself,

34:18.056 --> 34:22.328
"If he was in my position,
what would Sasha Belov do?"

34:26.398 --> 34:28.367
May I, sir?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.370
You can do this, Kaylie!

34:31.403 --> 34:33.439
C'mon, Kay. Whoo!

34:35.174 --> 34:38.177
[mid tempo rock music plays]

34:58.197 --> 34:59.331
[cheers, applause]

35:01.667 --> 35:03.702
[applause continues]

35:30.696 --> 35:33.665
The spot on the World Team
goes to the girl who showed

35:33.699 --> 35:37.569
talent, discipline and guts.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.639
That girl is...

35:41.707 --> 35:42.674
...Kaylie Cruz.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.711
[cheers, applause]

35:54.152 --> 35:57.623
Thank you. I couldn't
have done this without you.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.859
You're lucky your
strategy paid off.

36:03.795 --> 36:04.896
Well done, Kaylie.

36:06.532 --> 36:07.799
Thank you.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.406
Did you see the look
on Payson's face

36:14.440 --> 36:16.508
when we told her
she couldn't keep the dog?

36:16.542 --> 36:17.809
I know.

36:17.843 --> 36:21.247
Almost as sad as the look
in McGinty's eyes right now.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.748
Did you just call
her McGinty?

36:22.781 --> 36:24.816
Oh yeah, I did.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.318
Remember when we
promised the girls

36:26.352 --> 36:28.787
we'd get another dog
after McGinty died?

36:29.888 --> 36:32.691
C'mon honey, we agreed
we can't afford a dog right now.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.860
I know.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.562
What happened to us?

36:36.595 --> 36:39.231
You know what happened.
This economy happened.

36:39.265 --> 36:41.700
Payson's back, this move,

36:41.733 --> 36:44.736
the high price tag
on her dream happened.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.505
That's not what
I'm talking about.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.408
- Well, what then?
- Remember when we had Payson?

36:49.441 --> 36:50.876
We didn't have two nickels
to rub together,

36:50.909 --> 36:53.479
but we had faith that
everything would work out.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.713
Well, things
were different then.

36:54.746 --> 36:58.650
Yeah, they were. For one
thing, we weren't so afraid.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.786
We're afraid to tell the
girls that you're looking

37:00.819 --> 37:02.754
for a job in Boulder
in case you don't get it.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.657
We're afraid to adopt
an adorable mutt

37:05.691 --> 37:07.759
because she might
send us to the poor house.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.261
Circumstances made us poor,

37:09.295 --> 37:11.797
but we're choosing
to be scared.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.799
How are we supposed to feel?

37:13.832 --> 37:19.405
Supported. Taken care of,
like we always have been.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.373
I mean, in every
single rough patch

37:21.407 --> 37:25.311
we've ever been through...
what's happened?

37:26.378 --> 37:28.714
Well, it all worked out.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.883
So, what are you afraid
is going to happen this time?

37:33.585 --> 37:36.455
We've never been on such
thin ice before, Kim.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.756
It'll all work out, Mark.

37:37.789 --> 37:41.527
You being in Minnesota,
us all being apart?

37:41.560 --> 37:43.295
That's a second-class life.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.697
That's not
the life we want.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.899
We're a first-class family.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.803
It's time we stop being afraid
and started acting like one.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.440
You, me, Payson, and Becca.

37:54.473 --> 37:57.543
- [yelps]
- And McGinty?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.315
I think you mean Phoebe.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.954
Mom, you're acting like
it's all over, but it's not.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.622
I'm still going
to kill at Worlds.

38:10.656 --> 38:11.723
Oh really?
Cut the crap, Kelly.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.859
You're 16 years old,
grow up, all right.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.927
You promised you were
going to take care of
Kaylie, and did you?

38:15.961 --> 38:18.497
No, you couldn't. And now
she's going to Worlds.

38:18.530 --> 38:21.967
And guess what? A current
National Champion is worth
a hell of a lot more

38:22.000 --> 38:23.802
than a former
National Champion.

38:23.835 --> 38:24.970
- But I'm still...
- Just shut up for a minute.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.672
We have to figure out
what to do.

38:26.705 --> 38:27.973
We still have to get
this girl out of here.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.741
How?

38:31.477 --> 38:33.812
You sure that this girl
has an eating disorder?

38:33.845 --> 38:36.314
Yes, I'm positive.

38:36.348 --> 38:37.683
They're pretending
like it's an ACL injury,

38:37.716 --> 38:39.785
but I saw all the warning signs
before anyone else.

38:39.818 --> 38:43.789
So you know.
So if the press finds out
that Kaylie's anorexic,

38:43.822 --> 38:45.924
the NGO will freak,

38:45.957 --> 38:48.694
and she can kiss any chance
of any endorsements good-bye.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.830
But Kaylie isn't out
about her anorexia,

38:51.863 --> 38:53.499
and no one is going to
take our word for it.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.734
Well, I know. That's
why we need some proof.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.469
And you better hope
that we find some.

38:57.503 --> 38:58.870
Because if we don't, frankly,

38:58.904 --> 39:01.407
I think may have to drop
you as my client.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.409
[sobbing]
But you're my mother!

39:03.442 --> 39:04.710
Yes, I'm your mother,
but you know what?

39:04.743 --> 39:05.877
This is for your own good.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.846
This is the real world,
Kelly, all right?

39:07.879 --> 39:10.516
This is not the safe little
bubble that I created for you.

39:10.549 --> 39:13.785
This isn't my fault.
I did my job.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.787
I did it for you.
You failed.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.989
I counted on you,
and you failed, Kelly.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.559
- And that's it.
- Mom!

39:20.592 --> 39:22.728
Mom, please!

39:22.761 --> 39:23.862
Mom!

39:33.772 --> 39:35.106
[sobbing]

39:35.140 --> 39:38.810
Hey. You OK?

39:38.844 --> 39:40.912
I'm sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.648
It's cool. Really.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.350
I mean, I know how brutal
this sport can be.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.786
It's as if our whole life
is riding on my shoulders

39:47.819 --> 39:50.922
and everything is up to me,
everything.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.692
Believe me,
I know how that feels.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.394
I know I may seem
like a bitch,

39:56.428 --> 40:00.466
[sobbing] but I feel like
I'm just never good enough.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.101
And I'm just really tired
of playing perfect.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:12.678 --> 40:15.547
I can't believe we
have to say good-bye to her.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.715
I know.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.850
But there's a shelter
over on Meadows Drive.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.552
I figure, it's close enough

40:20.586 --> 40:22.420
that maybe we can run into
Phoebe and her new owner

40:22.454 --> 40:24.890
- every once in a while.
- You bought her a bed?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.658
I thought we were going
to take her to the shelter.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.594
Psych! My parents are
letting me keep her after all.

40:28.627 --> 40:31.196
No way! That is awesome!

40:32.464 --> 40:35.066
God, looks like you're
sticking around.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.702
I hope I can have
visiting rights.

40:36.735 --> 40:39.871
Of course. In fact,
I was kind of hoping

40:39.905 --> 40:42.073
that all of us could go to
Chautauqua Park for a run.

40:42.107 --> 40:46.812
Uh... You know, actually,
I can't. I have a thing.

40:46.845 --> 40:49.447
A date?

40:49.481 --> 40:51.917
Look, Payson,
I could lie and say no,

40:51.950 --> 40:53.952
but the truth is
I value you too much,

40:53.985 --> 40:56.822
so I'm always going
to be honest with you.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.957
So don't ask questions
if you don't want answers, OK?

40:58.990 --> 41:02.160
Yeah, yeah, It's cool.
I mean, I told you that.

41:03.929 --> 41:07.733
- Who with?
- Lauren. Yeah.

41:07.766 --> 41:11.102
She finally convinced me
to go on an official date.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.071
I don't even know what
I think of her. I just...

41:13.104 --> 41:14.439
Wow. Lauren. You know...

41:14.472 --> 41:16.742
Yeah. I know.
Yeah. Wish me luck.

41:16.775 --> 41:19.244
- [scoffs]
- [chuckles]

41:20.946 --> 41:23.882
So, are we the kind of friends
where I call after a date
to debrief and...

41:23.915 --> 41:27.786
- No, not so much.
- Yeah. I get it.

41:29.187 --> 41:33.925
Well, I don't think it
will be a late night,

41:33.959 --> 41:36.227
so do you and our little girl
want to go for that run
in the morning?

41:36.261 --> 41:38.964
- About 6:00?
- Yeah, You got it.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.967
All right.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.539
Yeah.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.845
[Kelly] Thank you for
letting me come over.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.647
I just had to get away
from my mother for a while.

41:55.681 --> 41:56.948
It's cool.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.851
Hey.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.252
Do you want to stay for dinner?

42:01.286 --> 42:04.189
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Totally.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.991
I'll just go tell my mom
to set an extra plate.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.860
- Kaylie.
- Hmm?

42:08.894 --> 42:11.997
I really appreciate you
letting me unload on you.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.733
I kind of don't have anybody
that I can confide in,

42:14.766 --> 42:16.868
and my mother isn't really
a touchy-feely kind of woman.

42:16.902 --> 42:19.571
- So...
- What about your friends?

42:19.605 --> 42:21.139
My mother doesn't
like me having friends.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.041
As far as she's concerned,
friends are just something

42:23.074 --> 42:25.577
that gets in the way of me
winning a gold medal.

42:25.611 --> 42:26.878
Wow.

42:26.912 --> 42:30.015
You know, in all honesty, Kelly,

42:30.048 --> 42:34.252
I don't think I could have won
Nationals without my friends.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.956
[soft rock music plays]

43:37.983 --> 43:39.317
[Kelly sighs]
