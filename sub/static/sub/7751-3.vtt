00:00.054 --> 00:01.464
<i>Previously on "Devious Maids"...</i>

00:01.488 --> 00:03.722
This is not your house!

00:03.755 --> 00:06.590
I am seriously thinking
about asking Nick to fire her.

00:06.625 --> 00:09.527
I will personally see to it
that my label honors our deal.

00:09.561 --> 00:12.496
You are the best husband
I never married.

00:12.531 --> 00:14.332
[Guests screaming]
I'm not screwing around, people!

00:14.366 --> 00:16.233
[Grunts]

00:16.268 --> 00:17.601
Oh, my God.
You shot him!

00:17.636 --> 00:19.503
[Voice breaking]
Somebody call 911!

00:19.538 --> 00:21.005
So, your husband
doesn't talk?

00:21.039 --> 00:24.041
Not since the stroke,
and... I'm his daughter.

00:24.076 --> 00:26.077
I'm his wife.
Oh.

00:26.111 --> 00:27.278
I know how it looks.

00:27.312 --> 00:29.880
But every once in a while,
I need to have a good time.

00:29.915 --> 00:31.849
I gave up
my whole life for him.

00:31.883 --> 00:33.150
You are such a liar.

00:34.052 --> 00:36.120
I think that means
I work for him.

00:36.154 --> 00:37.355
Can I talk to you
about something?

00:37.389 --> 00:38.622
Are you going to ask me out?

00:38.657 --> 00:40.224
You're unhappy?

00:40.258 --> 00:41.559
Since as long
as I can remember.

00:41.593 --> 00:43.561
So, you're leaving me?
I'm taking a break.

00:43.595 --> 00:44.962
Aah!

00:44.997 --> 00:47.131
Adrian is convinced
the gunmen will come back.

00:47.165 --> 00:49.300
This robbery has revealed
a new side to Adrian,

00:49.334 --> 00:50.634
and it frightens me,

00:50.669 --> 00:53.204
because there's one thing
that I cannot tolerate...

00:53.238 --> 00:54.705
And that is weakness.

00:54.740 --> 00:56.140
Somebody gave this to me.

00:56.174 --> 00:57.408
Now you're going
to give it to me.

00:57.442 --> 00:58.943
How can I ever repay you?

00:58.977 --> 01:01.512
Seeing you smile
is payment enough.

01:06.117 --> 01:09.820
Beverly Hills is under attack.

01:09.854 --> 01:12.656
Twice in the last month,
residents of our street

01:12.690 --> 01:15.459
have been brutalized
by home invaders.

01:15.493 --> 01:20.631
One of our neighbors,
Alejandro Rubio, is dead.

01:20.665 --> 01:26.581
The time has come for us
to meet this threat head-on.

01:27.138 --> 01:28.939
What exactly
are you suggesting?

01:28.973 --> 01:31.341
A neighborhood watch.

01:31.376 --> 01:33.010
Ah.

01:33.044 --> 01:34.645
I gonna need another scotch.

01:34.679 --> 01:37.114
The idea is to augment

01:37.148 --> 01:39.349
our own security
with nightly patrols.

01:39.384 --> 01:41.318
And who would do these patrols?

01:41.352 --> 01:42.486
We would.

01:42.520 --> 01:46.123
"We," as in...
Our servants?

01:46.157 --> 01:48.325
No, the residents
of canon drive.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.527
We'd all take shifts walking
our street at night,

01:50.562 --> 01:53.764
then call the police
if we see anyone suspicious.

01:53.798 --> 01:55.766
Well, everyone
looks suspicious to me.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.368
But that's because
I'm a little racist.

01:58.403 --> 02:00.704
Wait...
Can't we pay a company

02:00.738 --> 02:02.573
to do this type of thing
for us?

02:02.607 --> 02:03.907
Armor alert had a car
three blocks away

02:03.942 --> 02:05.108
the night our home
was broken into.

02:05.143 --> 02:06.176
It was useless!

02:06.211 --> 02:08.312
We need another layer
of security.

02:08.346 --> 02:11.281
Well, maybe we could host
a benefit luncheon

02:11.316 --> 02:12.716
to combat gun violence.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.351
Wouldn't that be better?

02:14.385 --> 02:15.986
How would that be better?

02:16.020 --> 02:18.555
Everything's better
with a luncheon.

02:18.590 --> 02:21.992
[Inhales deeply]
What is wrong with you people?!

02:22.026 --> 02:23.994
If you think
they won't come after you,

02:24.028 --> 02:25.229
you are kidding yourself.

02:25.263 --> 02:28.298
You're not safe.
You're not special.

02:28.333 --> 02:33.303
They will come into your home
and attack you and beat you.

02:33.338 --> 02:34.638
And you will deserve it

02:34.672 --> 02:36.773
because you're too cowardly
to stop them.

02:43.181 --> 02:46.016
Thank you so much
for coming, Tanya.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.518
So, I'll see you
at the club then?

02:47.552 --> 02:49.853
Absolutely. Tony,
you'll see her to the door?

02:49.888 --> 02:52.389
It would be his pleasure.

02:56.494 --> 03:00.464
I realize you're still
traumatized by the break-in,

03:00.498 --> 03:03.634
but my patience has officially
expired. [Door opens]

03:03.668 --> 03:05.502
[Door closes]

03:05.537 --> 03:08.272
You are going to get help.

03:08.306 --> 03:10.908
I don't care
if it's thai massage

03:10.942 --> 03:12.075
or talk therapy

03:12.110 --> 03:13.644
or massive amounts
of psychotropic drugs.

03:13.678 --> 03:16.213
I will no longer be subjected
to these paranoid rantings.

03:16.247 --> 03:17.548
Do you understand me?

03:19.117 --> 03:21.752
The house is all locked up,
Mrs. Powell.

03:21.786 --> 03:22.920
Anything else?

03:22.954 --> 03:24.254
I want you to help my husband

03:24.289 --> 03:25.889
move his things
to the guest room.

03:25.924 --> 03:29.226
Until his psychosis
has subsided,

03:29.260 --> 03:31.628
he is not welcome in my bed.

03:31.663 --> 03:34.298
[Sighs]

03:36.067 --> 03:38.135
You okay, Mr. Powell?

03:38.169 --> 03:40.304
[Sighs] I will be.

03:40.338 --> 03:43.640
I just need to take back
control of my life.

03:43.675 --> 03:45.742
Anything I can help you with?

03:45.777 --> 03:47.945
Oh, yeah.

03:50.415 --> 03:54.051
You're gonna get me a gun.

03:56.354 --> 04:02.230

what you have to do, Dahlia.

Get Opal out of that house

04:12.937 --> 04:15.205
[Gasps] What did Opal do?

04:15.239 --> 04:17.908
I don't know.
That's why I'm freaking out.

04:17.942 --> 04:19.309
Where's the rest of the letter?

04:19.344 --> 04:20.810
Those pages are missing.
[Sighs]

04:20.845 --> 04:22.312
Did you talk to Nicholas?

04:22.347 --> 04:25.983
No. He'll tell me it's nothing,
and I don't think it is.

04:26.017 --> 04:27.484
Dahlia's mother
wrote the letter.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.752
Can't you talk to her?

04:28.786 --> 04:31.588
Not without a ouija board.
She died last year.

04:31.623 --> 04:32.923
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

04:32.957 --> 04:34.925

Yeah.

04:34.959 --> 04:38.428
"Get Opal out of that house
immediately."

04:38.463 --> 04:42.599
I can't fire her for something
that happened 15 years ago.

04:42.634 --> 04:45.135
Unless it was really awful.

04:45.169 --> 04:47.304
I wish I knew what her mother
was referring to.

04:47.338 --> 04:49.973
Well, then... find someone
she was close to,

04:50.008 --> 04:51.642
someone she confided in.

04:51.676 --> 04:53.143
Oh, yes.

04:53.177 --> 04:56.313
Rich women always complain about
their maids to their friends.

04:56.347 --> 04:58.482
- You think?
- They complain about us.

04:58.516 --> 05:02.052
We complain about them.
It's the circle of life.

05:02.086 --> 05:04.054
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

05:04.088 --> 05:07.457
I got to go.
Hey, how's Carmen?

05:07.492 --> 05:09.126
I left her
a couple messages, but...

05:09.160 --> 05:10.894
She still can't talk about it.

05:10.928 --> 05:14.064
Of course not. To see
Alejandro killed like that.

05:14.098 --> 05:17.534
And now his family has arrived
for the funeral.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.871
How's that going?

05:20.905 --> 05:24.007
[Sobbing]

05:24.042 --> 05:26.009
Renata wanted me
to thank you both

05:26.044 --> 05:28.512
for taking such good care
of her nephew.

05:28.546 --> 05:31.181
Alejandro was a...
Wonderful man.

05:31.215 --> 05:34.584
He meant the world to us.
[Sobbing continues]

05:34.619 --> 05:36.420
Yeah,
she's having a rough time.

05:36.454 --> 05:38.522
He was all the family
that she had left.

05:38.556 --> 05:40.457
We're sorry for your loss!

05:40.491 --> 05:42.159
Let us know
if you need more Tequila.

05:44.462 --> 05:46.229
So, y-you're
Mrs. Rubio's lawyer?

05:46.264 --> 05:48.532
Yeah, I came out from Miami
to help her settle the estate.

05:48.566 --> 05:50.934
Renata's had some
pretty tough decisions to make.

05:50.968 --> 05:52.469
Like what?

05:52.503 --> 05:55.138
Alejandro, he left
most of his money to charity.

05:55.173 --> 05:56.440
His aunt only got the house,

05:56.474 --> 05:59.743
and she can't afford to maintain
it, so it's gonna be sold.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.913
Well... uh,
can we at least stay here

06:02.947 --> 06:04.281
while you try to sell it?

06:04.315 --> 06:07.284
Well, actually, we have a buyer,
and he's paying cash.

06:07.318 --> 06:09.786
But he's gonna
need you out by Friday.

06:09.821 --> 06:11.922
- Friday?
- Mm.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.890
That's four days from now.

06:13.925 --> 06:14.958
[Sobbing] Please.

06:14.992 --> 06:17.461
This is a difficult situation
for everyone.

06:17.495 --> 06:19.129
Oh, mostly for the people
getting kicked to the curb.

06:19.163 --> 06:21.998
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing that I can do.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.105
[Sighs]

06:28.139 --> 06:30.941
As far as I can tell,
he's exactly the same.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.542
Are you sure?

06:32.577 --> 06:35.946
Last week, at dinner, he slammed
his fist on the table.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.447
[Chuckles] And you are?

06:37.482 --> 06:38.782
Rosie.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.784
She's the maid.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.119
Well, there could be
other explanations.

06:42.153 --> 06:43.987
- Perhaps it was just a muscle spasm.
- Mnh-mnh.

06:44.021 --> 06:47.991
He's still in there.
I can tell.

06:48.025 --> 06:51.228
Maybe he would get better
with therapy.

06:51.262 --> 06:52.395
Well, I've checked
all his markers,

06:52.430 --> 06:54.731
and there's no indication
of improvement.

06:54.766 --> 06:57.067
Unless you'd like
a second opinion.

06:57.101 --> 06:59.736
[Chuckles] Don't be silly.
We trust you.

06:59.771 --> 07:01.071
Okay.

07:01.105 --> 07:02.906
Thanks again for stopping by.

07:02.940 --> 07:03.907
You're welcome.

07:03.941 --> 07:06.576
[Door opens, closes]

07:06.611 --> 07:08.912
He's a doctor
who makes house calls.

07:08.946 --> 07:11.581
You're supposed to kiss his ass,
not insult him!

07:11.616 --> 07:12.983
Some doctor.

07:13.017 --> 07:16.319
He was barely here 10 minutes.
He took his pulse.

07:16.354 --> 07:18.321
He went like this.

07:18.356 --> 07:21.124
- I could do that.
- Really?

07:21.159 --> 07:23.293
You got a medical degree
I don't know about?

07:23.327 --> 07:25.128
My abuelita had a stroke.

07:25.163 --> 07:27.631
My doctor made her get therapy.

07:27.665 --> 07:30.467
She learned
how to walk again and talk.

07:30.501 --> 07:33.270
Don't you want Mr. Kenneth
to get better?

07:35.640 --> 07:40.277
I think Dr. Sanders
is doing a fine job.

07:42.213 --> 07:46.249
Maybe you should think
about doing yours.

07:46.284 --> 07:50.120
Ew.

08:01.933 --> 08:03.233
Can I help you?

08:03.267 --> 08:06.069
I...Heard about...

08:06.103 --> 08:09.272
Mr. Rubio being killed.
I just wanted to...

08:10.875 --> 08:13.176
I don't know what I wanted.

08:13.211 --> 08:14.744
Were you a friend?

08:14.779 --> 08:16.562
I guess.

08:18.449 --> 08:20.684
I'm so sorry
that this happened.

08:20.718 --> 08:23.019
Don't worry.

08:23.054 --> 08:24.855
The men who did this,

08:24.889 --> 08:28.225
they will be caught...
And punished.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.198
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

08:36.234 --> 08:37.701
I was just doing some homework.

08:37.735 --> 08:39.302
But if you need the room,
I can...

08:39.337 --> 08:42.739
No, not at all. Actually,
I wanted task you something.

08:42.773 --> 08:46.743
Are there any pictures
of Dahlia around?

08:46.777 --> 08:48.078
I've heard so much about her,

08:48.112 --> 08:50.413
and I have no idea
what she looks like.

08:50.448 --> 08:54.017
So, does Nicholas
have a photo album?

08:54.051 --> 08:55.752
Sure. You want to
check them out?

08:55.786 --> 08:57.821
Yeah.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.559
That's her.

09:02.593 --> 09:04.895
Dahlia was beautiful.
Yeah.

09:04.929 --> 09:07.397
That was some, uh,
party that Nick threw for her.

09:07.431 --> 09:08.832
I was really little
at the time,

09:08.866 --> 09:11.401
but I remember watching everyone
in their fancy clothes and...

09:11.435 --> 09:13.236
[Chuckles] So,
these are all Dahlia's friends?

09:13.271 --> 09:15.739
Yeah.
She had a lot of them.

09:15.773 --> 09:17.340
Wait, that woman.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.676
Yeah, I clean her pool.

09:19.710 --> 09:21.878
She was, like,
Dahlia's best friend.

09:21.913 --> 09:25.382
Why? You know her?

09:25.416 --> 09:29.085
I absolutely do.

09:37.526 --> 09:39.527
[Vacuum whirring]

09:43.098 --> 09:44.232
[Whirring stops]

09:44.266 --> 09:46.033
Goodness.

09:46.068 --> 09:48.603
So much noise
from such a little machine.

09:48.637 --> 09:50.671
Well, sorry,
but I have to get this done

09:50.706 --> 09:52.340
before your luncheon tomorrow.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.841
I know. It's...

09:53.876 --> 09:55.509
[Whirring resumes]

09:57.346 --> 09:58.679
[Whirring stops]

10:00.048 --> 10:03.684
I had my fillers
injected today.

10:03.719 --> 10:07.421
If I don't sleep,
the botulism won't settle.

10:07.456 --> 10:09.090
Well, I need 10 more minutes.

10:09.124 --> 10:11.292
Then, I can scrub
the floors... quietly.

10:11.326 --> 10:15.596
But it's 11:00.
Don't you want to go home?

10:15.631 --> 10:17.098
Not really.

10:17.132 --> 10:21.168
I guess your house is feeling
a little empty these days.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.738
I don't want to talk about it.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.541
You know what?

10:27.576 --> 10:29.210
You need to have some fun.

10:29.244 --> 10:31.412
Why not come to the luncheon?

10:31.446 --> 10:34.548
I guess it would be nice to see
how the other half lives.

10:34.583 --> 10:35.883
Good.

10:35.918 --> 10:38.319
I'm so happy.

10:38.353 --> 10:40.288
You don't look happy.

10:40.322 --> 10:43.791
That means
the poison kicked in.

10:43.825 --> 10:46.794
[Sighs] Wonderful.

10:54.536 --> 10:56.170
<i>Sí.</i>

10:56.204 --> 10:57.672
I'm off to my appointment.

10:57.706 --> 10:59.240
When will you be back?

10:59.274 --> 11:01.609
Couple hours. Why?

11:01.643 --> 11:03.744
No reason.

11:08.216 --> 11:12.019
[Speaks spanish]
Mr. Kenneth.

11:12.054 --> 11:14.889
We got our own appointment.

11:16.992 --> 11:18.626
Now, don't be scared.

11:18.660 --> 11:21.128
We're just going
to a wonderful clinic.

11:21.163 --> 11:22.964
A friend of mine
who works there

11:22.998 --> 11:25.099
is going to tell me
how to make you better.

11:25.133 --> 11:26.734
[Strained] Just...

11:26.768 --> 11:29.570
Promise me
not to tell Mrs. Didi.

11:29.604 --> 11:32.073
[Sighs]

11:32.107 --> 11:35.142
Good enough.

11:35.177 --> 11:36.477
[Ringing]

11:36.511 --> 11:38.446
[Chuckles]
Valentina: Hey, Remi.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.714
Did I wake you?

11:39.748 --> 11:41.816
[Chuckles]
It's 2:00 in the morning.

11:41.850 --> 11:44.485
Sorry...
I needed to talk to someone,

11:44.519 --> 11:47.054
and... I didn't know
who else to call.

11:47.089 --> 11:50.057
My parents broke up.

11:50.092 --> 11:52.760
[Yawns] That's sad.

11:52.794 --> 11:55.396
Could you please not yawn
while I'm telling you this?

11:55.430 --> 11:57.865
Look, I-I just got done working
a 20-hour shift.

11:57.899 --> 11:59.633
I really need
to get some sleep.

11:59.668 --> 12:01.302
Fine.

12:01.336 --> 12:03.137
I mean, you'll call me back,
right?

12:03.171 --> 12:07.375
Maybe. I don't know.
Go back to bed.

12:07.409 --> 12:08.709
[Cellphone beeps]

12:08.744 --> 12:10.211
What a jerk.

12:10.245 --> 12:12.713
Were you eavesdropping?

12:12.748 --> 12:15.816
You're sort of...
In my office.

12:15.851 --> 12:16.917
Fine.

12:16.952 --> 12:18.919
Look, if you need
someone to talk to,

12:18.954 --> 12:21.355
maybe we could
go out to dinner some night.

12:21.390 --> 12:23.024
I promise I'd be wide awake
the whole time.

12:23.058 --> 12:24.692
I can't go on a date.

12:24.726 --> 12:27.361
I'm not over my relationship.
Really?

12:27.396 --> 12:32.066
Because sleeping beauty
sure seems like he's over you.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.300
His name is Remi,

12:33.335 --> 12:35.302
and he's working his ass off
to save people's lives.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.304
Don't make fun of him!

12:39.107 --> 12:40.741
Adrian.

12:40.776 --> 12:43.244
[Chuckling] You'll never guess
who I just ran into...

12:43.278 --> 12:45.079
Cynthia Florek.

12:45.113 --> 12:47.581
I told her about
what you've been going through,

12:47.616 --> 12:50.484
and she suggested you try
this organic herbal tea.

12:52.054 --> 12:54.722
[Gasps]
What in God's name is that?

12:54.756 --> 12:58.059
It's a Ruger SR1911 Commander.

12:58.093 --> 13:01.695
Isn't it beautiful?

13:04.099 --> 13:07.568
[Breathing heavily]

13:07.602 --> 13:09.737
You bought him a gun?

13:11.740 --> 13:12.706
[Sighs]

13:12.741 --> 13:14.742
Mr. Powell
just wants to feel safe.

13:14.776 --> 13:17.244
Oh, so do I, but I can't
because the moron I'm married to

13:17.279 --> 13:18.746
is now armed and dangerous.

13:18.780 --> 13:21.449
Relax.
I'm keeping an eye on him.

13:21.483 --> 13:23.451
No, you should have come to me
and asked for my permission.

13:23.485 --> 13:25.453
But instead, you gave
a deadly weapon to a man...

13:25.487 --> 13:27.388
Now what are you doing?

13:27.422 --> 13:30.691
I'm sweaty.
I need to dry off.

13:32.627 --> 13:34.762
[Sighs] You were saying?

13:34.796 --> 13:36.263
No, ah... [sighs]

13:36.298 --> 13:38.265
I was saying you gave
a deadly weapon

13:38.300 --> 13:39.533
to someone
whose mental state...

13:39.601 --> 13:40.534
[Breathes deeply]

13:40.569 --> 13:42.069
Don't you know
it's... offensive

13:42.104 --> 13:43.604
to disrobe in front of a lady?

13:43.638 --> 13:45.439
I do.

13:45.474 --> 13:48.075
But most ladies
avert their eyes.

13:48.110 --> 13:49.577
Stop changing the subject.

13:49.611 --> 13:52.179
The topic at hand
is your utter lack of judgment.

13:52.214 --> 13:53.647
[Sighs]

13:53.682 --> 13:57.518
Look... guns can be useful tools
if you know how to use them.

13:57.552 --> 13:59.753
I've got one in this room.

13:59.788 --> 14:02.156
Would you like me to teach you
how to handle it?

14:02.190 --> 14:05.459
I will never handle any gun.

14:05.494 --> 14:07.862
Especially yours.

14:12.234 --> 14:14.368
How can they just kick us out?

14:14.402 --> 14:15.703
Where are we supposed to go?

14:15.737 --> 14:17.371
This is Odessa Burakov.

14:17.405 --> 14:20.040
I'm calling to invite Mr. West
to Alejandro Rubio's funeral.

14:20.075 --> 14:22.710
'Cause I am broke.
I can't afford an apartment.

14:22.744 --> 14:24.378
Well, don't you have a friend
who can loan you money?

14:24.412 --> 14:26.547
I don't know.

14:26.581 --> 14:29.216
Do I?

14:29.251 --> 14:31.385
It's Thursday at 2:00.

14:31.419 --> 14:33.354
St. Peter's church
in Beverly Hills.

14:33.388 --> 14:35.189
See you then.

14:35.223 --> 14:36.991
[Telephone beeps]
It's not fair.

14:37.025 --> 14:38.692
Alejandro was
gonna get my career started.

14:38.727 --> 14:40.194
He made promises to me.

14:40.228 --> 14:42.563
Yes, it was very rude
of him to die.

14:42.597 --> 14:44.565
I don't mean it
like that, Odessa.

14:44.599 --> 14:47.568
I loved Alejandro.
But I want to be famous.

14:47.602 --> 14:49.069
And that's
gonna be harder to do

14:49.104 --> 14:50.538
once I'm living
under a freeway.

14:50.572 --> 14:51.739
I know you're worried,

14:51.773 --> 14:53.541
but Renata needs help
planning the funeral.

14:53.608 --> 14:55.409
It can't be all about you
right now.

14:55.443 --> 14:57.211
Can it be all about me
tomorrow?

14:57.245 --> 14:59.713
Yes. Life will return
to normal.

14:59.748 --> 15:02.049
Now help me invite people
to the service. I know.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.919
The ones with checks by
their names are already coming.

15:08.390 --> 15:10.524
Kanye?

15:10.559 --> 15:12.893
Justin Timberlake?
Beyoncé is coming?

15:12.928 --> 15:14.128
Oh, yes.

15:14.162 --> 15:16.297
The entire recording industry
will be there...

15:16.331 --> 15:18.299
Singers, songwriters,
producers.

15:19.768 --> 15:22.002
Oh.

15:22.037 --> 15:23.837
This is good.

15:23.872 --> 15:25.839
Yeah, this is very good.

15:28.777 --> 15:31.512
Buenos días, tia Renata.

15:31.546 --> 15:34.014
[Sighs] How is the
funeral coming along?

15:34.049 --> 15:37.318
Oh.
There's so much to do.

15:37.352 --> 15:38.686
- I'll bet, yeah.
- Oh.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.521
Hey.

15:40.555 --> 15:42.690
Have you thought
about some music?

15:42.724 --> 15:45.192
- Music?
- Yeah, sure.

15:45.227 --> 15:47.595
I mean, what's a funeral
without some singing.

15:53.150 --> 15:54.352
Genevieve!

15:54.358 --> 15:55.795
- Tanya!
- Hi, darling.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.964
Mwah. Mwah.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.465
Oh, your skin is radiant.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.134
Oh. Who's doing your injections?

16:01.168 --> 16:04.504
No one.
This is all natural.

16:04.538 --> 16:07.006
[Both laugh]

16:07.041 --> 16:08.141
Oh, that never gets old.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.243
And neither do we.
[Laughs]

16:10.277 --> 16:11.744
Tanya, you know Zoila.

16:11.779 --> 16:13.846
Uh, no, I don't believe
we've met.

16:13.881 --> 16:16.616
I'm her maid.
We've met 10 times.

16:16.650 --> 16:18.017
Oh. My fault.

16:18.052 --> 16:20.353
I never really look at
the people who bring me drinks.

16:20.387 --> 16:21.387
So...
[Chuckles]

16:21.422 --> 16:22.855
Oh.

16:22.890 --> 16:25.058
Our featured speaker
just arrived.

16:25.092 --> 16:28.594
He's going to be lecturing today
on the cause of gun violence.

16:28.629 --> 16:29.929
You leave me alone
with this woman,

16:29.963 --> 16:31.764
and you'll be the cause
of gun violence.

16:31.799 --> 16:35.501
I'll be right back.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.504
You know, it's a bit warm.

16:38.539 --> 16:42.208
I should, uh...
I should get rid of this.

16:42.242 --> 16:46.879
Genevieve invited me
to this luncheon as her guest.

16:46.914 --> 16:49.015
And there's a closet
around the corner.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.016
[Inhales sharply]

16:50.050 --> 16:51.350
Look, I-I don't need
all the details.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.253
Just, um... make it go away.
[Chuckles] Okay?

16:54.288 --> 16:57.023
You got it.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.194
- Hey, Zoila.
- Oh.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.595
Mm.

17:02.629 --> 17:05.397
Thank you so much for getting me
an invitation to this party.

17:05.432 --> 17:09.035
They're all bitches.
Good luck to you.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.876
Evelyn.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.545
Oh.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.415
Well, if it isn't
the ghost of housecleaning past.

17:22.449 --> 17:23.950
Nice to see you, too.

17:23.983 --> 17:25.617
Why are you still
working as a maid?

17:25.652 --> 17:27.119
Don't tell me
another family member's

17:27.154 --> 17:29.355
been falsely imprisoned.

17:29.389 --> 17:31.190
I'm running in your circles
these days.

17:31.225 --> 17:33.259
I'm engaged
to Nicholas Deering.

17:33.293 --> 17:35.928
[Gulps]

17:35.963 --> 17:37.597
Oh.

17:37.631 --> 17:39.899
I hope this isn't awkward
for you.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.235
Adrian and I hired you
to scrub our toilets,

17:42.269 --> 17:44.904
and now you're with a man
worth twice what we are.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.073
Why would that be awkward?

17:50.978 --> 17:53.679
The other doctor says
he can't get better,

17:53.714 --> 17:54.947
but I think he can.

17:54.982 --> 17:56.115
Oh, I agree.

17:56.150 --> 17:57.383
And I can't imagine why

17:57.417 --> 18:00.153
his family physician hasn't
insisted on physical therapy.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.721
That's what I said.

18:01.755 --> 18:03.890
Right?
Didn't I say that?

18:03.924 --> 18:06.392
Now, obviously, we'll have to
work on his mobility...

18:06.426 --> 18:07.727
Three times a week
to begin with.

18:07.761 --> 18:10.730
Uh, my office can refer
a rehab facility.

18:10.764 --> 18:12.899
Thank you so much,
Dr. Joe.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.567
I also want you to get
a rubber ball.

18:14.601 --> 18:16.335
Mm-hmm. Have him
practice squeezing.

18:16.370 --> 18:17.837
Once he has mobility
in his hand,

18:17.871 --> 18:20.406
get a keyboard in front of him.
See if he can type.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.909
The sooner he can communicate
with us, the better.

18:22.943 --> 18:24.911
I will.

18:24.945 --> 18:28.714
This is so exciting,
Mr. Kenneth.

18:28.749 --> 18:31.717
[Singsong voice]
You're gonna get better.

18:31.752 --> 18:35.354
[Normal voice] Thank you.

18:37.758 --> 18:40.226
You doing okay back there?

18:40.260 --> 18:42.628
We'll get you home soon.

18:55.075 --> 18:57.143
[Gasps]

19:08.288 --> 19:10.723
[Indistinct conversations]

19:10.757 --> 19:12.491
Could I have my coat now?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.827
Oh, right.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.096
You have to apologize first.

19:17.130 --> 19:18.731
Excuse me?

19:18.799 --> 19:21.100
See, the way you demanded
I just take your coat

19:21.134 --> 19:24.170
was, you know... rude.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.339
Well, I don't think
that I was rude.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.709
Then you were raised by apes.

19:29.743 --> 19:32.378
Give me my coat.
Hmm.

19:32.412 --> 19:34.113
Genevieve, your maid refuses
to give me my coat.

19:34.147 --> 19:36.949
I told her I was here
as your guest,

19:36.984 --> 19:39.285
and she just shoved
that ratty old fur into my hands

19:39.319 --> 19:40.386
like I was her slave.

19:40.420 --> 19:42.889
- To hell with her.
- Okay, okay.

19:42.923 --> 19:45.124
What about this?
I'll get the coat.

19:45.158 --> 19:46.559
Thank you.

19:46.593 --> 19:48.895
I didn't put it in the closet.

19:48.929 --> 19:51.397
Oh. Where is it?

19:51.431 --> 19:53.532
Not until I get an apology.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.969
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Make her give me my coat.

19:57.004 --> 19:58.804
Can't you just apologize?

19:58.839 --> 20:00.139
Oh, for God's sake.
She is your maid.

20:00.173 --> 20:02.008
Doesn't she have to do
what you say?

20:03.944 --> 20:07.580
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

20:12.753 --> 20:13.886
Evelyn.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.621
May I talk to you for a moment?

20:15.656 --> 20:16.956
Why not?

20:16.990 --> 20:18.791
I've just finished
my third wine spritzer.

20:18.825 --> 20:20.927
I'm ready to pretend
we're equals now.

20:20.961 --> 20:22.595
[Pats chair]

20:22.629 --> 20:24.997
[Sighs]

20:25.032 --> 20:26.899
So, I understand

20:26.934 --> 20:29.969
that you were very close
with Nicholas' first wife.

20:30.003 --> 20:32.305
I loved Dahlia like a sister.

20:32.339 --> 20:34.807
And I'm guessing
she confided in you.

20:34.841 --> 20:35.808
All the time.

20:35.842 --> 20:38.477
But I can't betray secrets.

20:38.512 --> 20:40.780
- Can you gossip?
- That, I can do.

20:40.814 --> 20:45.618
Did Dahlia ever...
Talk about her maid?

20:45.652 --> 20:47.787
Opal?

20:47.821 --> 20:49.355
Not really.

20:49.389 --> 20:51.524
She complained
about her housekeeping.

20:51.558 --> 20:54.360
Opal was less than immaculate.
[Chuckles]

20:54.394 --> 20:57.596
Not like you. You can vacuum
with the best of them.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.099
Thank you.

21:00.133 --> 21:04.603
So, Dahlia never talked about
wanting to get rid of Opal?

21:04.638 --> 21:06.439
No.

21:06.473 --> 21:10.443
Although...
[Clears throat]

21:10.477 --> 21:13.446
Since she died,
there have been rumors.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.947
Rumors?

21:14.982 --> 21:17.650
This is the very worst
kind of gossip.

21:17.684 --> 21:19.986
People can be so cruel.

21:20.020 --> 21:23.823
But it does make sense
when you think about it.

21:23.857 --> 21:25.491
What are you talking about?

21:25.525 --> 21:28.828
He's been alone in that house
for 15 years,

21:28.862 --> 21:31.163
never dating,
never socializing.

21:31.198 --> 21:33.165
And men have needs.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.167
And she was right there.

21:35.202 --> 21:36.369
Wait. Wait.

21:36.403 --> 21:40.873
Are you suggesting that
Nick and Opal had an affair?

21:40.907 --> 21:43.042
[Gasps] Oh, dear.

21:43.076 --> 21:46.879
I hope this isn't awkward
for you.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.359
Very good, Mr. Kenneth.

21:57.393 --> 22:00.362
Soon, you will be able to type
on your computer,

22:00.396 --> 22:03.565
and we'll be able to have
nice, long talks.

22:03.599 --> 22:06.568
[Door closes] [Gasps]

22:06.602 --> 22:09.504
I'll be right back,
Mr. Kenneth.

22:13.008 --> 22:15.643
You're back already?

22:15.678 --> 22:18.480
Uh, yeah.

22:19.014 --> 22:22.616
- Did you start dinner?
- I didn't have time.

22:22.651 --> 22:25.987
While you were out, I took
Mr. Kenneth to a new doctor.

22:26.021 --> 22:28.155
What?

22:28.190 --> 22:30.791
He says therapy will
really help Mr. Kenneth.

22:30.826 --> 22:33.594
He wants him to start going
three times a week.

22:33.628 --> 22:36.097
I don't care what some
quack friend of yours wants.

22:36.131 --> 22:37.164
You don't take my husband

22:37.199 --> 22:38.666
out of this house
without my permission.

22:38.700 --> 22:41.002
And then, coming back,
this funny thing happened.

22:41.036 --> 22:43.671
Are you listening to me?
You're fired.

22:43.705 --> 22:45.473
I want you gone in an hour.

22:45.507 --> 22:48.275
I saw you kissing Dr. Sanders
in the street.

22:51.680 --> 22:56.450
I was just... thanking him
for his help with Kenny.

22:56.485 --> 22:59.887
From what I saw, you were very,
very thankful.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.889
[Sighs]

23:01.923 --> 23:03.657
Are you gonna tell Lucinda?

23:03.692 --> 23:06.527
Not if you let Mr. Kenneth
get the help he needs.

23:06.561 --> 23:09.397
Fine.
But it won't do any good.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.665
Bill says he's a lost cause.

23:11.700 --> 23:14.902
My doctor promised me therapy
will make a difference.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.904
Why would bill lie?

23:16.938 --> 23:21.108
Maybe he thinks you're more fun
without a husband.

23:21.143 --> 23:24.779
If there is a chance that Kenny
can go back to being Kenny,

23:24.813 --> 23:27.181
of course I'd love to meet
this new doctor.

23:27.215 --> 23:29.784

are going to come back.

when they do.

You don't look so good.

I know.
I haven't slept in days.

24:42.290 --> 24:44.758
I was about to get myself
some tea.

24:44.793 --> 24:46.327
I could fix you some, too.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.329
Yeah.

can I say something?

with a gun...

Did you know that Evelyn and I
had a son?

25:14.656 --> 25:17.191
- No.
- He died when he was six.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.292
Oh, my God.

25:18.326 --> 25:20.060
I gave him a bike
for his birthday.

Evelyn took him out riding.

25:21.363 --> 25:23.230
She turned her back
for just a second.

25:23.265 --> 25:25.900
He rode into the street,
and this car came.

Whoever was driving
didn't even stop.

25:28.637 --> 25:31.372
They just kept going.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.040
I'm so sorry.

I should have been there
to protect him.

for everyone if I didn't know,

you've been gossiping
about my personal life.

32:34.969 --> 32:37.070
Do you know
how that makes me feel?

32:37.104 --> 32:38.838
Humiliated?

32:38.906 --> 32:40.373
Exactly.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.377
What are you doing?

32:44.412 --> 32:45.545
[Sighs] I'm sitting.

32:45.579 --> 32:46.713
[Scoffs]

32:46.747 --> 32:49.049
Go on.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.552
You told Tanya
so she would apologize.

32:52.586 --> 32:56.056
You'd rather betray
my confidence

32:56.090 --> 32:59.426
than be embarrassed
about some stupid coat.

32:59.460 --> 33:02.095
Well?

33:02.129 --> 33:04.064
Aren't you gonna
defend yourself?

33:04.098 --> 33:06.266
I was wrong.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.601
What's with all the serenity?

33:08.636 --> 33:11.604
See, I don't mind if you yell

33:11.639 --> 33:13.606
because I know you're not
really angry with me.

33:13.641 --> 33:15.608
- Oh, yes, I am.
- No.

33:15.643 --> 33:19.446
And you're not angry
about Tanya's coat, either.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.082
This is about your husband.

33:24.452 --> 33:28.088
So, you can yell
and throw things

33:28.122 --> 33:30.924
and tell me to go to hell

33:30.958 --> 33:35.395
because I'm not Pablo
or Valentina.

33:35.429 --> 33:38.131
I will never leave you.

33:44.705 --> 33:45.939
See?

33:45.973 --> 33:49.342
This is why it's important
that we talk these things out.

33:49.376 --> 33:53.179
Because if we don't, we cry and
ruin our makeup. [Sniffles]

33:53.214 --> 33:55.949
I should probably go.

33:55.983 --> 33:58.618
To that empty house?

33:58.652 --> 34:00.286
No.

34:00.321 --> 34:02.455
You're gonna stay here
for awhile.

34:02.490 --> 34:05.758
I couldn't impose.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.994
Don't be silly.

34:08.027 --> 34:09.661
It'll be fun.

34:09.697 --> 34:12.732
We'll stay up late and eat carbs.
[Chuckles]

34:12.766 --> 34:14.734
What do you say?

34:14.768 --> 34:16.735
[Sniffles]

34:16.770 --> 34:18.737
I say...

34:20.808 --> 34:24.110
You're an amazing woman.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.270
It's so true.

34:31.319 --> 34:36.121
[Moaning]

34:45.699 --> 34:48.335
[Breathing heavily]

35:08.589 --> 35:11.391
Tony?

35:11.425 --> 35:14.761
It's Mrs. Powell...
Evelyn.

35:16.831 --> 35:19.332
I wanted to talk to you.

35:43.624 --> 35:45.458
[Doorknob rattling]

35:47.128 --> 35:50.263
For God's sake.

35:50.297 --> 35:52.265
[Chuckles]

35:58.973 --> 35:59.939
[Gunshot]

35:59.974 --> 36:01.608
[Gasps] [Thud]

36:05.746 --> 36:07.747
Evelyn!

36:14.288 --> 36:16.056
You idiot.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.214
Shouldn't we take her
to the hospital?

36:30.249 --> 36:32.049
You just grazed her.

36:32.084 --> 36:34.585
And besides, they have to
report gunshot wounds.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.087
You could be arrested.

36:36.121 --> 36:37.588
But Evelyn wouldn't
press charges.

36:37.623 --> 36:39.056
Would you, sweetheart?

36:39.091 --> 36:40.591
[Sighs]

36:40.626 --> 36:44.195
There's a doctor I know...
Very discreet.

36:44.229 --> 36:47.832
Phone him and say Tony Bishara
is calling in a favor.

36:49.835 --> 36:53.805
Obviously,
you're furious at me.

36:53.839 --> 36:57.809
I'm hoping, in time...
Perhaps with some counseling,

36:57.843 --> 36:59.210
you could find it
in your heart...

36:59.244 --> 37:01.746
Could we discuss this
once I've stopped bleeding?

37:01.780 --> 37:04.315
Sure.

37:04.350 --> 37:06.484
[Sighs]

37:12.558 --> 37:14.025
What is it?

37:14.059 --> 37:17.195
I saw you tonight.

37:17.229 --> 37:19.197
With Tanya.

37:19.231 --> 37:20.865
Oh.

37:20.900 --> 37:23.034
Now, I could care less
who you sleep with.

37:23.068 --> 37:25.003
It makes no difference to me.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.538
But just know
Tanya's breasts are fake

37:26.572 --> 37:28.473
and she's had chlamydia twice.

37:28.507 --> 37:31.543
Mrs. Taseltov
means nothing to me.

37:31.577 --> 37:34.679
Then why be with her?

37:34.713 --> 37:38.516
Because... I can't have
who I really want.

37:38.551 --> 37:41.819
Why not?

37:41.854 --> 37:45.390
Well, this woman
I'm interested in... is married,

37:45.424 --> 37:50.195
and I think if I ever told her
how I really felt...

37:50.229 --> 37:52.797
She'd be angry with me.

37:52.831 --> 37:58.283
Maybe... this... woman...

37:59.171 --> 38:01.005
Isn't happy.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.241
Maybe her husband
is falling apart

38:03.275 --> 38:06.911
and she is desperately in need
of a strong man like you.

38:06.946 --> 38:11.649
So... you think
I should tell her how I feel?

38:14.320 --> 38:16.120
As soon as possible.

38:22.094 --> 38:27.198
And even though Alejandro
was very famous,

38:27.233 --> 38:29.767
he never forgot
where he came from.

38:29.802 --> 38:32.604
When I turned 50,
I had a big party,

38:32.638 --> 38:36.708
and he flew in all the way
from Los Angeles just to see me.

38:39.211 --> 38:41.679
Anyway...

38:41.714 --> 38:44.549
[Voice breaking]
...I will miss him very much.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.051
[Sniffles]

38:47.086 --> 38:49.220
And now Carmen Luna

38:49.255 --> 38:54.225
would like to honor Alejandro
with a musical tribute.

38:55.961 --> 38:57.595
[Breathes shakily]

38:57.630 --> 39:00.298
Hello. I'm Carmen.

39:00.332 --> 39:03.201
Alejandro was my mentor.

39:03.235 --> 39:05.370
He taught me to believe
in myself and to...

39:05.404 --> 39:07.405
To pursue my dreams.

39:07.439 --> 39:11.409
Alejandro, this is for you.

39:11.443 --> 39:15.146
[Piano music plays]

39:28.827 --> 39:29.761
[Music stops]

39:29.795 --> 39:33.197
[Music resumes]

39:41.840 --> 39:43.975
I'm sorry.
[Music stops]

39:44.009 --> 39:45.977
Start again.

39:46.011 --> 39:48.946
[Music resumes]

39:53.786 --> 39:56.254
I r...
[Music stops]

39:58.457 --> 40:00.091
I'm sorry.

40:00.125 --> 40:02.660
[Sniffles]

40:02.695 --> 40:05.930
[Voice breaking]
He was so good to me.

40:05.964 --> 40:08.333
[Sniffles]

40:08.367 --> 40:13.371
I didn't realize
I was gonna miss him so much.

40:15.474 --> 40:19.277
[Crying]

40:21.046 --> 40:24.449
That was the tribute
he deserved.

40:43.105 --> 40:44.574
