WEBVTT

00:07.418 --> 00:10.019
Hey! Mind if I come in?

00:10.021 --> 00:12.255
House or bedroom? 'Cause
you've already done both.

00:12.257 --> 00:13.990
So what you doing, huh?

00:13.992 --> 00:15.196
Oh, sadly reminiscing

00:15.221 --> 00:16.859
- about the ex-boyfriend?
- No.

00:16.861 --> 00:18.227
I'm just finally boxing up his stuff.

00:18.229 --> 00:19.729
Scarf and beanie collection.

00:19.731 --> 00:21.364
Journals. Drawing charcoals?

00:21.366 --> 00:23.165
What? Are you sending a care package

00:23.167 --> 00:24.934
to a lesbian art student in Vermont?

00:24.936 --> 00:27.536
- I know, right?
- You don't miss him, do you?

00:27.538 --> 00:30.072
Evan? God, no. He was
the worst boyfriend ever.

00:30.074 --> 00:31.874
Good, 'cause you
needed to break up with him.

00:31.876 --> 00:33.242
But I got to tell you, ever since,

00:33.244 --> 00:34.543
you've been into hermit mode.

00:34.545 --> 00:35.764
Not true.

00:35.904 --> 00:37.947
I've been hanging out
with you and Dad and Brad.

00:37.949 --> 00:40.116
Okay, that is a little tragic.
I need to make some plans.

00:40.118 --> 00:41.550
Or make new friends.

00:41.552 --> 00:43.552
At a game night.

00:43.554 --> 00:45.421
Why do I have a dark
sense of foreboding?

00:45.423 --> 00:47.056
Because it's happening.

00:47.058 --> 00:49.225
Come on in, you guys.

00:49.227 --> 00:50.126
Um...

00:50.128 --> 00:51.232
Okay, so this is Pam.

00:51.338 --> 00:53.929
She's a disgraced pharmacist
and a delightful person.

00:53.931 --> 00:55.865
This is Troy of Helena, Montana,

00:55.867 --> 00:58.567
- and you already know School Bus.
- I do not.

00:58.569 --> 01:00.803
- This is School Bus.
- You have a lovely home.

01:00.805 --> 01:03.506
You've struck a perfect balance
between clean lines and whimsy.

01:03.508 --> 01:05.206
Not easy to do.

01:05.209 --> 01:07.310
Let's take this party to
the living room, shall we?

01:07.312 --> 01:08.944
Because Troy's already rummaging.

01:10.248 --> 01:11.914
It's a finely-woven merino.

01:11.916 --> 01:13.549
Thank you.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.051
The name of the game is Celebrity.

01:15.053 --> 01:16.552
Famous people only.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.688
Okay, this person...

01:18.690 --> 01:20.523
hangs out at the drugstore
parking lot all the time.

01:20.525 --> 01:22.958
- Uh, Lisa, the Human Beatbox.
- Correct.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.927
This person did community
service with Pam.

01:24.929 --> 01:26.896
- The Other Johnny!
- Boom! It was The Other Johnny.

01:26.898 --> 01:28.998
- I know that because I was there.
- Nice.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.396
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah, none of

01:30.421 --> 01:31.834
the people in the bowl are famous.

01:31.836 --> 01:34.537
Well, you're up next, but,
listen, don't worry.

01:34.539 --> 01:36.351
I'll use my angel powers,

01:36.376 --> 01:38.307
- and we'll crush it.
- Okay.

01:38.309 --> 01:41.877
Time! All right, Allison's turn.

01:41.879 --> 01:42.845
Okay.

01:42.847 --> 01:45.014
Okay. And... go.

01:45.016 --> 01:46.816
This is a pretty common name?

01:46.818 --> 01:48.384
Chris Smith, DDS to the streets.

01:48.386 --> 01:49.852
Yes, that's right.

01:49.854 --> 01:51.020
Solid clue.

01:51.022 --> 01:52.755
Okay, this is a part of the...

01:52.757 --> 01:54.190
Pinky Toenail! He's a religious rapper.

01:54.192 --> 01:55.658
His beats turn water into wine.

01:55.660 --> 01:57.259
- That was fast. God.
- Yeah.

01:57.261 --> 01:59.428
- Oh, this is an actual celebrity.
- Joe-Keen Phoenix.

01:59.430 --> 02:01.297
- Yes! Wow, um...
- Wow.

02:01.299 --> 02:02.465
But it's actually pronounced “Joaquin.”

02:02.467 --> 02:04.300
- I've only ever read it.
- Time!

02:04.302 --> 02:07.503
Allison, nice!

02:07.505 --> 02:08.770
Good round.

02:08.773 --> 02:10.172
Well, well, well.

02:10.174 --> 02:12.575
We crushed it, and, Pam...

02:13.249 --> 02:14.977
I do believe you owe me your hair.

02:14.979 --> 02:16.979
Well, a bet's a bet.

02:18.282 --> 02:20.516
Everybody, how about this?

02:20.518 --> 02:22.051
Victory wig!

02:22.053 --> 02:23.319
Looking good, girl.

02:23.321 --> 02:24.920
All right, everybody, round two.

02:24.922 --> 02:26.789
Oh, well, you know, I think I'm done.

02:26.791 --> 02:28.858
- What?! We're having so much fun.
- Yeah.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.327
- I'm wearing Pam's hair.
- I can see that.

02:31.329 --> 02:33.329
Well, thank you for
an enchanting evening.

02:33.331 --> 02:37.566
Oh, you are very welcome... School Bus.

02:37.568 --> 02:39.935
Uh, what's the deal with this bowl?

02:39.937 --> 02:43.139
Is it, like...? Like, are you keeping it?

02:43.141 --> 02:45.474
It's a crystal bowl. I'm keeping it.

02:45.476 --> 02:47.443
Everybody out.

02:47.445 --> 02:49.311
Sure, let's take this
to the guesthouse.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.312
For security reasons.

02:50.314 --> 02:52.248
All right, party in the
guesthouse, everybody.

02:53.818 --> 02:58.454
- Easy there, Bradzilla.
- Don't love when you call me that.

02:58.456 --> 03:01.457
- Look what I just got.
- Whoa. Is that the Phantom 2?

03:01.459 --> 03:02.758
It is. That's a top-notch drone, Dad.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.327
- Right?
- You always have the best toys, man.

03:05.329 --> 03:06.796
As you should. You know, you deserve it.

03:06.798 --> 03:08.631
You've built this successful practice.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.003
Why are you in sales mode?

03:10.028 --> 03:12.134
But what is the true
measure of success?

03:12.136 --> 03:13.602
Okay, I guess we're doing this.

03:13.604 --> 03:15.971
I define it as someone
looking out for their friends.

03:15.973 --> 03:18.140
Speaking of which, your
buddy, Steve McGuire, is trying

03:18.142 --> 03:20.976
to sell his house, and I
want to become his listing agent.

03:20.978 --> 03:22.545
Now, I see this as an opportunity

03:22.547 --> 03:24.113
for a win-win-win-win-win.

03:24.115 --> 03:25.581
Seems like one too many wins.

03:25.583 --> 03:26.982
I'd rather stay out of it if you don't...

03:26.984 --> 03:28.951
Siri, I have a will to bend.

03:28.953 --> 03:32.354
Here's what I found for wildebeests.
Traveling in packs.

03:32.356 --> 03:34.123
Wait, wait, wait. I didn't
know they traveled in packs.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.725
They do. They also pounce on
opportunities and define success

03:36.727 --> 03:38.561
as looking out for their friends.

03:38.563 --> 03:41.130
Ah, man. I'll send Steve an e-mail.

03:41.132 --> 03:42.598
Yes! Call might feel more personal,

03:42.600 --> 03:44.300
but I'll leave that up to you.

03:44.302 --> 03:45.501
Thanks, Dad.

03:45.503 --> 03:47.903
Got him with the hard sell.

03:49.507 --> 03:53.542
Siri, tell me everything you
know about wildebeests.

03:53.544 --> 03:57.780
Traveling in packs, this
mammal performs an annual...

03:59.884 --> 04:02.751
Oh, hey, Mr. Gibbs.

04:02.753 --> 04:04.753
Of course I have time for my supervisor.

04:04.755 --> 04:06.422
What's up, man?

04:06.424 --> 04:08.591
What? I'm on angel probation?

04:08.593 --> 04:10.593
Well, wait, wait, wait, slow down.

04:10.595 --> 04:13.095
You suspended my powers because
I cheated at game night?

04:13.097 --> 04:14.864
Oh, come on.

04:14.866 --> 04:18.334
So I read my human's mind to
let her win at Celebrity.

04:18.336 --> 04:21.036
Big deal. And don't you
have better things to do?

04:21.038 --> 04:25.708
I mean, isn't there a
giant refugee crisis everywhere?

04:25.710 --> 04:28.677
What do I have to do to
get my powers restored?

04:30.281 --> 04:31.747
Ten good deeds?

04:31.749 --> 04:33.782
Isn't that a tad excessive?

04:33.784 --> 04:35.651
No, I don't want 11.

04:35.653 --> 04:37.753
I'll take the ten.

04:39.624 --> 04:41.357
What's happening?

04:41.359 --> 04:44.193
I've been put on angel probation.

04:44.195 --> 04:45.761
The probation part makes a lot of sense.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.496
I'm offline from the angel cloud,

04:47.498 --> 04:50.065
which is the information
source I use to protect you.

04:50.067 --> 04:52.735
I have no premonitions, no powers.

04:52.737 --> 04:54.336
In fact...

04:54.338 --> 04:56.539
I'm as stupid as a human.

04:56.541 --> 04:57.873
Who's drilling books into my wall.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.608
- In case of an earthquake.
- I don't think

04:59.610 --> 05:02.011
a paperback copy of Gone
Girl's gonna knock me out.

05:02.013 --> 05:03.879
Well, you obviously
haven't gotten to the twist yet.

05:03.881 --> 05:06.949
Listen to me, you need to
be extra careful, okay?

05:06.951 --> 05:09.051
Because danger can be anywhere.

05:10.321 --> 05:11.787
- Want to get that?
- Are you sure?

05:11.789 --> 05:13.200
It might be the bogeyman!

05:13.202 --> 05:17.259
Allison, the bogeyman only
goes after children.

05:22.366 --> 05:26.035
- Hi, Evan.
- Hey, Allison.

05:26.037 --> 05:29.071
Just here to get my stuff.

05:29.073 --> 05:31.173
This is way worse than the bogeyman.

05:31.175 --> 05:33.642
At least you can trick him with riddles.

05:33.644 --> 05:36.579
Come on in.

05:36.581 --> 05:39.816
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:43.267 --> 05:45.785
Okay. Well, I'll get your stuff.

05:45.787 --> 05:47.453
Hey, remember me? I'm Amy, the S.O.B.

05:47.455 --> 05:49.055
that told Allison you
were cheating on her.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.690
Sound like a pretty good friend.

05:50.692 --> 05:52.125
Don't talk to me.

05:52.127 --> 05:53.726
What are you doing here?

05:53.728 --> 05:56.496
Picking up my stuff. Thought
that was pretty clear.

05:56.498 --> 05:58.931
Sorry, I'm... I'm a little off today.

05:58.933 --> 06:01.300
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

06:01.302 --> 06:03.136
- Mm-hmm.
- For packaging it all up.

06:03.138 --> 06:03.970
Bye now.

06:03.972 --> 06:06.439
Um...

06:06.441 --> 06:08.441
is there any way that we can talk,

06:08.443 --> 06:10.943
just, you know, alone for a second?

06:10.945 --> 06:12.912
One Mississippi. Bye now.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.180
Amy, guesthouse.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.552
Wow. Terrible reflexes.

06:19.554 --> 06:21.054
So, what's up?

06:21.056 --> 06:23.790
I just wanted to say how sorry I am

06:23.792 --> 06:27.660
for pretty much being the
worst boyfriend in the world.

06:27.662 --> 06:30.129
Okay. Apology noted.

06:30.131 --> 06:31.364
But not accepted.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.504
Oh. Hey, buddy.

06:38.506 --> 06:40.473
Oh, my gosh, who is this?

06:40.475 --> 06:42.708
Oh, that's Prince.

06:42.710 --> 06:44.644
- Where did you get him?
- Uh, Oliver.

06:44.646 --> 06:46.679
Remember, he, uh, you know,
volunteers at that rescue?

06:46.681 --> 06:48.214
Oh, yeah. How is he?

06:48.216 --> 06:50.483
I haven't seen him or
Jenny since we broke up.

06:50.485 --> 06:52.018
They're both... they're-they're great.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.486
They're really... they're good.

06:53.488 --> 06:54.854
Bye now.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.792
All right, I should probably go.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.061
- Yeah.
- All right, Prince, car.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.437
Are you seeing this?
This dog is a genius.

07:11.439 --> 07:14.941
Oh, relax. It's just one of those
new trunk-opening sensors.

07:14.943 --> 07:17.410
You know, dogs are actually much
smarter than human beings.

07:17.412 --> 07:19.378
It's just their fascination
with their own butt

07:19.380 --> 07:20.980
that's holding them back.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.682
See?

07:22.684 --> 07:24.584
Bogeyman and his wonder dog are gone.

07:24.586 --> 07:25.985
Oh, that was way too close.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.720
I got to start
knocking out these good deeds

07:27.722 --> 07:29.789
and get back online.

07:29.791 --> 07:32.758
All right, who's
hurting for a good deed?

07:33.828 --> 07:36.996
Oh. This man-bun trim

07:36.998 --> 07:39.565
should count as two
good deeds. One for him

07:39.567 --> 07:42.034
and one for the rest of the world.

07:43.238 --> 07:46.372
Dado! Nope, never called
you that before.

07:46.374 --> 07:48.841
- Didn't quite work. Felt weird.
- What's going on?

07:48.843 --> 07:51.144
Well, I wanted to swing by
and tell you the good news.

07:51.146 --> 07:52.879
That Steve McGuire hired
me as his agent.

07:52.881 --> 07:56.649
Yes, I got your e-card.
Felt very personal.

07:56.651 --> 07:58.184
And as a further thank you,

07:58.186 --> 08:00.386
I wanted to present you
with another opportunity.

08:00.388 --> 08:02.622
- And we're back in sales mode.
- Sharp as a tack.

08:02.624 --> 08:05.491
Can I borrow your drone for
aerial pics of his house?

08:05.493 --> 08:06.993
No. It's brand-new.

08:06.995 --> 08:08.828
Get a selfie stick.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.796
Oh, my God, you think I
would break your drone.

08:10.798 --> 08:12.932
And you don't know what
a selfie stick is, do you?

08:12.934 --> 08:14.433
Yes, I think you're
gonna break my drone.

08:14.435 --> 08:15.868
You're Bradzilla. It's what you do.

08:15.870 --> 08:16.944
Don't love when you call me that.

08:16.949 --> 08:19.372
And is this is because I messed
up your toy train set town?

08:19.374 --> 08:23.576
“Messed up.” You burnt West
Marvington to the ground.

08:23.578 --> 08:24.944
I was 12, thank you very much.

08:24.946 --> 08:26.345
I'm an adult now,

08:26.347 --> 08:28.014
and I fly drones all
the time at Brookstone.

08:28.016 --> 08:29.849
And I understand what
a lame brag that is.

08:29.851 --> 08:31.651
Please? It would mean a lot to me.

08:31.653 --> 08:34.921
- Fine.
- Thank you. Really.

08:34.923 --> 08:37.256
I love you, Dad.

08:38.993 --> 08:41.894
- Closed it with the sincere pitch.
- Huh?

08:42.764 --> 08:44.263
Hey, what are you doing here?

08:44.265 --> 08:46.199
Look, I just want to
make sure you're okay.

08:46.201 --> 08:48.201
And to let you know that
I am four deeds in,

08:48.203 --> 08:50.136
and some amount to get to ten.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.272
I have no math skills
without my you-know-whats.

08:53.274 --> 08:54.557
So Evan hasn't dropped by

08:54.582 --> 08:55.942
- here, has he?
- Whoa.

08:55.944 --> 08:56.855
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.144
- You've been hanging out with Evan?
- I'm sorry.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.712
Did I just hear the name
of he-who-will-not-be-named?

08:59.714 --> 09:01.341
Okay, guys, he just
came by to pick up his stuff.

09:01.342 --> 09:03.355
- It is not a big deal.
- Good. Good, 'cause

09:03.379 --> 09:05.318
I'd be all up in his face.
I'd be like,

09:05.320 --> 09:07.720
- “Oh, what's up, Evan? How you doing?”
- Look at me, falling for jukes.

09:07.722 --> 09:09.355
I'm flying blind here.

09:09.357 --> 09:10.389
- What?
- What?

09:10.391 --> 09:11.624
I will lock you away

09:11.626 --> 09:13.292
in a castle if you start up again

09:13.294 --> 09:14.694
with he-who-will-not-be-named.

09:14.696 --> 09:16.329
Guys, I'm never
even gonna see him again.

09:16.331 --> 09:17.763
- Good.
- Except when I dog-sit

09:17.765 --> 09:19.532
his unbelievably
adorable dog later today.

09:19.534 --> 09:21.524
- Oh! Come on.
- Oh! Allison!

09:21.525 --> 09:23.736
Did I mention he is the
cutest puppy-wuppy of all time?

09:23.738 --> 09:25.538
She's always been dog obsessed.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.306
It's her Achilles' paw.

09:27.308 --> 09:29.242
Sorry. It was hanging
out there like a tomato.

09:29.244 --> 09:31.143
So, what time is Evan
coming over to drop off the dog?

09:31.145 --> 09:32.354
- 4:00.
- 4:00.

09:32.356 --> 09:33.268
It's 2:00 now,

09:33.269 --> 09:35.165
which gives me an incalculable
amount of time

09:35.166 --> 09:37.049
to do an indeterminate number of deeds.

09:37.051 --> 09:39.485
Fullers, excuse me.

09:42.023 --> 09:43.623
She seems off today.

09:43.625 --> 09:47.126
I mean, she's always
off, but today, it's off-off.

09:53.434 --> 09:56.736
Go home. Be with your family.

09:56.738 --> 09:59.372
Tell 'em you love 'em.

10:00.608 --> 10:02.575
Count it.

10:07.282 --> 10:09.682
Go home. Be with your family.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.421
Go home.

10:17.859 --> 10:20.159
Did you know

10:20.161 --> 10:22.428
that the human body,
with no angel powers,

10:22.430 --> 10:24.463
can get drunk on eight drinks?

10:24.465 --> 10:27.300
I'm so hungry.

10:27.302 --> 10:31.070
Just a reminder, the
plastic bananas remain plastic.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.111
What, dog? I don't understand you

10:39.113 --> 10:41.247
without my powers, man.

10:41.916 --> 10:43.849
Oh, turkey dogs.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.251
Oh, good call.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.585
I can't eat these.

10:46.587 --> 10:48.354
Angels can't eat other birds.

10:50.758 --> 10:53.926
Fly, turkey dogs. Fly!

10:58.266 --> 10:59.231
Where's Prince?

10:59.233 --> 11:00.299
Don't ask me.

11:00.301 --> 11:01.367
Why is the door open?

11:01.369 --> 11:02.435
'Cause I just threw

11:02.437 --> 11:04.437
some... Guys,

11:04.439 --> 11:07.106
is Prince the kind of dog

11:07.108 --> 11:08.474
that if you waved some food in front

11:08.476 --> 11:10.309
of his nose and then you just whipped it

11:10.311 --> 11:13.412
out the door, that he'd go after it?

11:13.414 --> 11:15.614
Because if so...

11:15.616 --> 11:18.043
Oh, my God. He got out.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.318
Oh, no. He probably
didn't get too far.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.753
- We'll find him.
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:20.755 --> 11:22.321
You guys, wait. You can't go running off

11:22.323 --> 11:23.989
with each other like
that, not without me,

11:23.991 --> 11:26.759
like you're in some
kind of a damn rom-com.

11:26.761 --> 11:28.160
I'm coming with you.

11:28.162 --> 11:32.064
Oh. After I buckle my... my old boots.

11:33.835 --> 11:36.202
Now that I'm down
here, I think I'm just gonna...

11:36.204 --> 11:41.407
rest my head on
the... on the kitchen floor.

11:43.378 --> 11:46.278
That's like the cool side of the pillow.

11:49.681 --> 11:51.581
Well, thank you, guys,
for helping us out.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.150
I feel terrible. I can't
believe we didn't find him.

11:54.152 --> 11:56.019
It's almost midnight, Allison.

11:56.021 --> 11:58.087
We put up all the
flyers, we put a blast out

11:58.089 --> 12:00.356
to all the shelters. I mean,
we're doing everything we can.

12:00.358 --> 12:02.725
I even left a trail of
dog treats leading back

12:02.727 --> 12:05.562
to your house. Uh, you may
have an upcoming raccoon problem.

12:05.564 --> 12:09.399
Look, Prince is a smart dog.
He's gonna find his way back.

12:09.401 --> 12:11.901
The best thing we
can do is just hang here

12:11.903 --> 12:13.469
and wait for him to come back.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.305
- I don't know, guys.
- Okay,

12:15.307 --> 12:18.007
let's get your mind off this. Let's
make some food, all right?

12:18.009 --> 12:20.143
Everything's gonna be fine. Let's do it.

12:20.145 --> 12:21.878
- Let's grub it up.
- Feast!

12:21.880 --> 12:24.280
Whoa.

12:24.282 --> 12:26.716
Amy. 24601,

12:26.718 --> 12:28.151
ready for cell check.

12:28.153 --> 12:30.720
Hey, everybody.

12:30.722 --> 12:32.422
This is Amy. She's...

12:32.424 --> 12:34.090
This is Amy.

12:34.092 --> 12:36.526
Ah, it's hard to define what
we have, isn't it, kid?

12:36.528 --> 12:39.529
Why can't I open up these cabinets?

12:39.531 --> 12:40.797
They're baby-proof.

12:40.799 --> 12:42.131
Well, I guess

12:42.133 --> 12:43.600
if we're cooking tonight,

12:43.602 --> 12:45.501
I'd better turn the gas back on.

12:47.873 --> 12:50.306
Allison, there's been
a terrible accident.

12:50.308 --> 12:52.375
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:52.377 --> 12:53.710
I crashed Dad's drone.

12:53.712 --> 12:56.479
Why would you put it in
a doggy-sized body bag?

12:56.481 --> 12:58.982
Huh? No, I crashed it right
in these glass doors.

12:58.984 --> 13:01.885
It's all Humpty Dumpty'd.
He's gonna kill me.

13:01.887 --> 13:03.052
Great Train Fire of '93 all over again.

13:03.054 --> 13:05.355
Allison, be part of the solution.

13:05.357 --> 13:07.557
Okay. Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna order a new one online.

13:07.559 --> 13:09.926
Then you're gonna glue that one back
together. When the new one comes in,

13:09.928 --> 13:12.328
you're gonna swap 'em out, okay? I've
got stuff you can use in the closet.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.498
What's that doing here?

13:16.434 --> 13:18.067
Hey, Brad.

13:18.069 --> 13:19.903
If I weren't in the
middle of a serious craft crisis,

13:19.905 --> 13:21.504
I would so handle this right now.

13:24.776 --> 13:27.877
Wow. Terrible reflexes.

13:29.848 --> 13:31.681
Do you realize

13:31.683 --> 13:33.449
this is the second
night we were unable to find

13:33.451 --> 13:34.751
a little guy named Prince?

13:34.753 --> 13:36.419
You're talking about Bakersfield.

13:36.421 --> 13:38.154
We went all the way up
there to see Prince in concert,

13:38.156 --> 13:40.490
and the tickets that
Oliver got were fake.

13:40.492 --> 13:41.925
But the money I spent was very real.

13:41.927 --> 13:43.626
And you all still owe me.

13:44.763 --> 13:46.596
Seriously. It's been a year.

13:46.598 --> 13:48.231
There was the time we
thought we saw Prince

13:48.233 --> 13:50.266
in the parking lot, but
instead it was just

13:50.268 --> 13:52.135
a snazzy old Filipino lady.

13:52.137 --> 13:53.269
I still tell people

13:53.271 --> 13:54.103
I saw him.

13:55.807 --> 13:57.674
Such classic, good
times. Remember that time

13:57.676 --> 13:59.976
you guys found me
asleep on the kitchen floor?

14:04.149 --> 14:05.581
Oh... little pickles.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.984
Guys, I can't stop thinking
about the dog.

14:07.986 --> 14:08.985
I know.

14:08.987 --> 14:10.520
Well, maybe this will help.

14:14.259 --> 14:15.858
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

14:15.860 --> 14:17.894
I thought that was gonna start
a super fun food fight.

14:17.896 --> 14:21.164
But now I realize I
just threw meat at your face.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:31.643 --> 14:34.277
- Come with me.
- Oh.

14:34.279 --> 14:36.913
First of all, I think I'm fitting
in great with your friends.

14:36.915 --> 14:38.815
Secondly, what was up with
that Evan arm touch?

14:38.817 --> 14:41.484
I don't know. Am I actually
having a good time with Evan?

14:41.486 --> 14:43.319
Am I that idiot girl who actually thinks

14:43.321 --> 14:44.854
her jerk ex-boyfriend might have changed?

14:44.856 --> 14:46.255
And am I that idiot friend who thinks

14:46.257 --> 14:47.957
you two have crazy chemistry?

14:47.959 --> 14:50.460
Do I miss Evan? Is that even possible?

14:50.462 --> 14:51.995
I don't know. Without my angel powers,

14:51.997 --> 14:53.696
I am unable to guide you.

14:53.698 --> 14:56.132
Enough with the fake powers.
I need my nice, hard-drinking,

14:56.134 --> 14:58.501
bizarrely wise friend to
give me some good advice.

14:58.503 --> 15:02.271
Okay. I-I think you should...

15:02.273 --> 15:05.908
I'm so sorry. For the first time
in my life, I'm confused.

15:05.910 --> 15:08.144
For the first time? What about that
time you said you could catch a bullet?

15:08.146 --> 15:09.912
Shoot me and I'll show you. Actually,

15:09.914 --> 15:12.615
wait until I get my angel powers back.

15:21.793 --> 15:24.293
Go for Amy. Roger that.

15:24.295 --> 15:26.796
Hey, everybody! Get up! Got
a hot lead on the dog.

15:26.798 --> 15:28.865
School Bus saw Prince in the cemetery

15:28.867 --> 15:32.869
while he was digging up...
clues about where to find the dog.

15:32.871 --> 15:35.171
Let's roll!

15:35.173 --> 15:36.372
All right, I just caught a glimpse of him

15:36.374 --> 15:37.407
over by the Rodriguez funeral,

15:37.409 --> 15:39.142
so I'd start there.

15:39.144 --> 15:40.243
And if you have time,

15:40.245 --> 15:41.911
Rudolph Valentino is buried here.

15:41.913 --> 15:43.913
Very powerful experience.

15:43.915 --> 15:47.350
Okay. Let's go find Prince!

15:47.352 --> 15:49.318
Allison, honey, I don't
want you to worry.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.121
We're gonna find him. We
have a technological advantage.

15:52.123 --> 15:54.023
Brad, get the drone.

15:54.025 --> 15:56.059
Do we use it in a cemetery, though?

15:56.061 --> 15:57.427
That seems disrespectful.

15:57.429 --> 15:59.796
The Rodriguezes just
buried their mamacita.

15:59.798 --> 16:00.777
We need it to get a

16:00.802 --> 16:02.065
- bird's-eye view.
- Right,

16:02.067 --> 16:03.666
but wouldn't you want a dog's-eye view

16:03.668 --> 16:05.701
in this situation? That would
be more helpful, right?

16:05.703 --> 16:08.404
I-I could see using a drone
if Allison had lost Evan's eagle.

16:08.406 --> 16:10.440
Brad, it's every drone owner's dream

16:10.442 --> 16:12.775
to get called in on a rescue mission.

16:12.777 --> 16:14.510
Now, let's get the toy.

16:17.248 --> 16:19.749
Be careful with Evan.

16:19.751 --> 16:23.953
Or go for it. I don't know. I'm adrift.

16:25.657 --> 16:27.290
- And here we go!
- D... Yeah, let's not...

16:27.292 --> 16:29.158
let's not expect too much
your first time out, Dad. Up.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.794
I... Up!

16:34.432 --> 16:36.199
Oh...

16:39.070 --> 16:40.269
- Did you...
- I think it's

16:40.271 --> 16:42.238
- pretty obvious.
- And you thought a half-assed

16:42.240 --> 16:43.840
MacGyver job would do the trick?

16:43.842 --> 16:45.141
I... didn't want

16:45.143 --> 16:46.843
to disappoint you and
pull another Bradzilla.

16:46.845 --> 16:48.444
You already think I'm a screwup.

16:48.446 --> 16:51.180
No, no, no, no, no. A
klutz maybe but never a screwup.

16:51.182 --> 16:53.516
Dad, I had to sell you on
recommending me to your friend.

16:53.518 --> 16:55.451
That's because it's Steve
McGuire. He's an ass,

16:55.453 --> 16:57.602
and I was worried about you
having to work with him.

16:57.603 --> 16:59.689
Well, he does not know how
to take a compliment.

16:59.691 --> 17:00.723
About his daughter.

17:00.725 --> 17:02.658
And he was not super cool

17:02.660 --> 17:04.292
about a drone crashing
through his glass doors.

17:04.295 --> 17:05.761
That sounds like quite

17:05.762 --> 17:07.329
the tour de force for Bradzilla.

17:07.332 --> 17:09.898
You're only looking at
one side of that nickname.

17:09.901 --> 17:11.567
The other reason I call you Bradzilla is

17:11.569 --> 17:13.402
because you don't let
anything stand in your way,

17:13.404 --> 17:15.137
which is why you're
such a good salesman.

17:15.140 --> 17:18.808
So you forgive this dummy for
breaking your cool new toy?

17:18.810 --> 17:20.409
Don't even give it another thought.

17:20.411 --> 17:21.644
Let's go find this dog.

17:21.646 --> 17:23.813
Thanks, Dad.

17:23.815 --> 17:27.884
Closed him with the humble pitch.

17:27.886 --> 17:29.852
Hey, mister.

17:29.854 --> 17:32.355
Where you been, huh?

17:32.357 --> 17:33.789
Korea?

17:33.791 --> 17:36.359
Koreatown. Sorry. I should've
let you finish.

17:36.361 --> 17:39.795
Wait, my powers are back.

17:39.797 --> 17:43.199
Oh! Finding you must
be my final good deed.

17:43.201 --> 17:45.434
Oh, man.

17:45.436 --> 17:48.104
It feels so good. Not being able

17:48.106 --> 17:51.807
to talk to dogs made me
feel like a crazy person.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.777
Okay. Now that I'm back online,

17:54.779 --> 17:58.014
I can see this whole
situation with Allison very clearly.

17:58.016 --> 17:59.849
And this is what I need you to do.

18:06.524 --> 18:08.609
Prince!

18:08.611 --> 18:10.511
Oh, we'll find him soon.

18:10.513 --> 18:12.379
Then we can go out and celebrate, huh?

18:12.381 --> 18:13.747
Yeah. What?

18:13.749 --> 18:16.851
No, I meant... “we” as in all of us

18:16.853 --> 18:19.487
go out and celebrate.

18:19.489 --> 18:23.124
But... I know I don't really
have any place to ask this,

18:23.126 --> 18:27.828
but would you maybe someday
be interested in, you know,

18:27.830 --> 18:31.198
going to grab coffee with an
incredibly humbled d-bag?

18:31.200 --> 18:34.768
You know, just to catch
up and... get some coffee.

18:34.770 --> 18:36.737
Um...

18:36.739 --> 18:38.772
Whose car is this?!

18:38.774 --> 18:41.208
I need to know whose car this is!

18:41.210 --> 18:43.144
Um, th-that's mine. Why? What's up?

18:43.146 --> 18:45.012
There is a dog in there!

18:45.014 --> 18:46.814
Locked up! On a warm morning!

18:46.816 --> 18:50.151
Has this place not seen enough death?!

18:50.153 --> 18:51.452
Buddy!

18:51.454 --> 18:53.888
- Oh.
- Buddy!

18:53.890 --> 18:54.955
Prince!

18:54.957 --> 18:57.616
Hi. Yay! Hey, pal.

18:57.616 --> 19:00.995
Oh, you smell like you've been eating
trash all night, and I don't even care.

19:00.997 --> 19:04.064
Oh, dude, buddy, you got
into my drawing charcoals.

19:04.066 --> 19:05.232
Yeah, but we found him.

19:05.234 --> 19:06.333
Absolutely.

19:06.335 --> 19:08.802
He got into my uke!

19:08.804 --> 19:11.972
Leilani.

19:11.974 --> 19:14.575
That's okay. We'll fix you back up.

19:14.577 --> 19:15.843
Oh, God, I hope not.

19:15.845 --> 19:17.111
Oh, that dog is a hero. If I had

19:17.113 --> 19:19.480
to hear “Over the
Rainbo”" one more time...

19:19.482 --> 19:22.082
That is so weird. I thought
you guys were all into his ukulele.

19:22.084 --> 19:23.817
You seemed to really
love it up in Big Bear.

19:23.819 --> 19:26.620
- A, we were stoned as statues.
- We were totally out of it.

19:26.622 --> 19:28.389
And B, we loved that
face you made when he sang

19:28.391 --> 19:30.024
in that vaguely Samoan accent.

19:30.026 --> 19:32.293
Vaguely Samoan but completely offensive.

19:33.396 --> 19:35.663
He got my scarves!

19:35.665 --> 19:37.698
Can I just say? We miss you, Allison.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.668
I miss you guys, too. I
just... I don't know. I guess

19:40.670 --> 19:43.370
I thought you all, you know,
picked Evan in the breakup

19:43.372 --> 19:44.205
and that's why we weren't

19:44.230 --> 19:45.239
- hanging out.
- Are you kidding?

19:45.241 --> 19:47.074
No, we just wanted
to give you some space.

19:47.076 --> 19:49.276
We were worried that
we remind you of him.

19:49.278 --> 19:52.046
Okay. The three of
us, going out, very soon.

19:52.048 --> 19:55.849
And he got my Tibetan prayer beads.

19:55.851 --> 19:57.251
Yes. We got Allison back.

20:01.424 --> 20:03.962
She's all yours.

20:06.462 --> 20:07.795
Hey.

20:07.797 --> 20:09.263
I was bumbling my way

20:09.265 --> 20:11.298
into wondering if you
might want to get coff...

20:11.300 --> 20:13.133
No. I'm sorry. That was abrupt.

20:13.135 --> 20:15.502
Uh, no, thank you.

20:15.504 --> 20:18.539
I think I just got confused
about who I was missing.

20:18.541 --> 20:19.573
Yeah. So get

20:19.575 --> 20:21.175
in your lame compact SUV

20:21.177 --> 20:22.343
and show me some taillights.

20:22.345 --> 20:23.978
You heard him.

20:26.282 --> 20:27.781
Dr. Fuller. Dude.

20:27.783 --> 20:29.049
Yeah, Dad, you got to
pull up before you...

20:29.051 --> 20:30.017
None of that went right.

20:30.019 --> 20:31.151
Sorry, Evan.

20:31.153 --> 20:33.220
I swore I'd never say his name.

20:33.222 --> 20:34.755
Take care of yourself, Evan.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.958
Good boy.
