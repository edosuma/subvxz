00:02.503 --> 00:05.171
Radiologist,
contact 5317.

00:05.297 --> 00:08.383
Radiologist, contact 5317.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.802
- Amber.
- No.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.805
- Why not?
- Amber's a stripper name.

00:13.931 --> 00:17.266
Find me one stripper
named Amber Hartig.

00:17.393 --> 00:18.768
Or not. Okay.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.396
Non-stripper names.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.691
Desiree? Bambi? Kandy Kane?

00:24.817 --> 00:28.444
Max. Maxine.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.905
Max Hartig.
It's a cute name, isn't it?

00:31.031 --> 00:34.325
If you're a professional boxer,
maybe.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.786
Can you believe we made
this little creature?

00:36.912 --> 00:38.246
I know. It's incredible.

00:38.372 --> 00:42.041
It's the most amazing thing
we've ever done.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.502
I almost ran the marathon last year.

00:44.628 --> 00:47.130
If we're lucky, you won't inherit
your daddy's sense of humor.

00:47.256 --> 00:50.550
Hello. Say hi to bear.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.848
She hasn't even eaten anything.
Why is she spitting up?

00:56.974 --> 00:59.851
- Well, honey, we can't bug them again.
- Just...

00:59.977 --> 01:01.269
Okay, okay.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.357
I'm sorry. It's our first kid.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.859
We're both a little panicky, I guess.

01:07.985 --> 01:11.863
Well, you got to ask the pediatrician
next time. I just deliver them.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.114
Is she spitting up?

01:13.240 --> 01:15.992
- Yeah. Second time in an hour.
- Oh.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.202
If you lived underwater
for nine months,

01:18.328 --> 01:20.413
you'd have a lot to spit up, too.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.043
Is something wrong?

01:26.170 --> 01:27.795
A little lethargic.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.630
- Well, we didn't think...
- She's hot.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.968
Is she...

01:34.094 --> 01:35.595
The baby's seizing! Get the crash cart!

01:35.721 --> 01:37.263
What's wrong?

01:37.389 --> 01:38.473
Need some help in here!

01:38.599 --> 01:40.933
Oh, God. Is she all right?

01:41.059 --> 01:42.852
- IV access?
- No, Ativan.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.520
What's going on?

02:22.768 --> 02:24.644
The MRI's back.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.978
And?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.980
It's what we expected.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.982
The accident caused serious damage.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.528
It's amnesia.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.116
I'm sorry.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.245
I just can't believe it.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.711
Enjoying our lounge, House?

02:50.838 --> 02:53.881
Just came in to get milk for my coffee,
which you're out of.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.049
Flat or sparkling?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.009
- Sparkling.
- Flat.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.680
So, the Hartigs?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.306
Their baby gets a fever.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.183
Wait, don't tell me,
the kid had a seizure.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.269
Yep. The parents, of course,
start freaking,

03:06.395 --> 03:07.937
and I have to deal with that
for an hour.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.355
Like it was your fault.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.690
She was perfect when I delivered her.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.192
If you wanna blame someone,
blame the pediatrician.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.902
So, how is the kid now?

03:15.028 --> 03:18.656
Bowel obstruction. She's under
observation. She'll be fine.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.617
The pediatrician
will take all the credit.

03:28.959 --> 03:34.672
Exhibit A, baby girl Hartig,
term baby, 42 hours old.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.133
Went into seizures six hours ago,
brought into the intensive care,

03:37.259 --> 03:40.094
diagnosed with obstruction of
the small bowel.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.889
I'm still amazed you're actually
in the same room with a patient.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.266
People don't bug me
until they get teeth.

03:45.392 --> 03:49.979
Exhibit B, baby boy Hausen,
another term baby, 48 hours old.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.773
Brought into the NICU three hours
before the Hartig baby.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.485
Fever of unknown origin,
101 degrees, trending upwards.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.280
Wow, that is amazing. You hung out
in the OB/GYN lounge all morning

03:59.406 --> 04:00.948
and heard about two sick babies.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.409
- It's eerie.
- Don't touch that.

04:03.535 --> 04:04.577
All right.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.913
We have an infection
spreading in the hospital.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.708
These kids have
totally unrelated illnesses.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.377
They fell sick
within four hours of each other.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.962
They had the same delivery rooms,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.715
maternity rooms are neighboring,
so transmission's possible.

04:17.841 --> 04:18.966
They have the same symptoms.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.426
The Hartig girl
has a bowel obstruction.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.719
No matter how close their beds are,

04:21.845 --> 04:23.179
I'm pretty sure kids
can't share a blockage.

04:23.305 --> 04:26.098
What does bowel obstruction
on a chart indicate?

04:26.224 --> 04:29.936
Well, normally, I'd say it indicates
a patient's bowel is obstructed,

04:30.062 --> 04:31.771
but I'm pretty sure you have
some deeper truth to impart...

04:31.897 --> 04:34.607
It means that some random doctor
of indeterminate skill

04:34.733 --> 04:36.609
thinks that the patient's bowel
is obstructed.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.986
Okay, you're upset because
they threw you out of their lounge.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.072
Look at the X-ray.
It's a normal gas pattern.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.865
If you want, I can get you a key
to the oncology lounge.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.450
- Air in the colon.
- We're getting TiVo.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.994
If it's air, no bowel obstruction.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.622
Even if it is air, it could have been
there before the obstruction.

04:49.748 --> 04:53.918
No. Something's infected
both these infants.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.756
And you're the only one
who put this together because...

04:58.882 --> 05:01.092
Because I'm the only one
who looked at both kids.

05:01.218 --> 05:04.303
I want them isolated. I want
the maternity ward shut down.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.681
Because you're better at reading
an X-ray than a radiologist.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.933
Radiologists always over-read
babies' X-rays,

05:09.059 --> 05:10.977
especially if they're asked
to rule out a pathology.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.311
He read into it what he wanted.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.980
Which is exactly what you're doing.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.648
You're finding a cluster because

05:15.774 --> 05:17.984
you think it's interesting
to find a cluster.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.903
Two plain old sick babies
would bore you.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.406
See, this is why
I don't waste money on shrinks,

05:23.532 --> 05:25.700
'cause you give me all these really
great insights for free.

05:25.826 --> 05:30.955
Shrink. If you would consider going to
a shrink, I would pay for it myself.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.416
The hospital would hold a bake sale,
for God's sake.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.292
We have an epidemic.

05:36.712 --> 05:41.841
Two sick babies is very sad,
but it doesn't prove an epidemic.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.223
How many do?

05:52.144 --> 05:55.146
Get up. We're going hunting.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.314
For what?

05:57.441 --> 05:58.774
Wabbits.

06:10.579 --> 06:14.540
Hi. Bye. He's screaming. He's fine.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.672
Good-looking baby.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.596
Sorry. Wrong room.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.014
We'll see you later.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.724
12 rooms, right? That's it?

06:31.850 --> 06:32.808
Yep.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.479
We've definitely checked
the whole floor.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.231
Good news. No epidemic.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.067
Tragic, huh?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.530
Overflow rooms, third floor.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.200
This imaginary infection
has spread to the next floor?

06:50.702 --> 06:52.661
We were just gonna call.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.497
Did he get hot all of a sudden?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.083
Yeah.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.340
Yeah,
I'll take care of that for you.

07:07.886 --> 07:08.886
Almost there, honey.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.930
Don't worry. We're almost there.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.934
Excuse me! Hi.
Intake sent you up here?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.185
Yeah, my wife's contractions
are less...

07:16.311 --> 07:17.353
Okay, Intake messed up.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.896
I am very, very sorry.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.982
Nurse Alpert will arrange
for an ambulance

07:22.109 --> 07:23.776
to take you to Princeton General.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.154
The maternity ward is
temporarily closed.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.739
We have to leave?

07:28.865 --> 07:29.990
Yes. I am very sorry.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.450
Why are you doing this?

07:32.702 --> 07:35.037
You will be there very, very soon.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.040
Happy now?

07:38.166 --> 07:41.085
No, but I am interested.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.972
Three sick babies and a fourth
showing early symptoms.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.849
- How bad?
- Spiking fevers.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.434
BP's plummeting. They're barely able to
keep systolic up.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.811
At this rate,
they could be dead in a day.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.979
Where did this come from?

08:00.105 --> 08:01.981
Two delivery rooms,
four different maternity rooms.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.774
No common personnel
and no common equipment.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.484
Well, there's got to be
something in common.

08:05.610 --> 08:09.572
Yeah. That would be the difference
between an epidemic and a coincidence.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.823
I'm putting a team together.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.700
We're gonna start swabbing.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.910
What's she gonna swab?
Every respirator,

08:15.036 --> 08:16.829
sink, vent,
drain in the entire hospital?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.747
- That'll take months.
- Needle in a haystack.

08:18.874 --> 08:19.874
It's worse than that.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.709
We don't even know
it's a needle we're looking for.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.960
Then why'd you let her go do it?

08:23.086 --> 08:26.630
Because the hospital is her baby,
and her baby's sick.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.883
If she doesn't solve this soon,
her head's gonna explode,

08:29.009 --> 08:30.092
and I don't want to get any on me.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.802
So let's figure out
what's in the haystack.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.305
- Differential diagnosis, people.
- Parasite.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.848
It's spreading too quickly.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.183
- Next?
- Virus?

08:37.309 --> 08:40.853
The kids are too sick, and the blood
tests showed no lymphocytosis.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.606
And they're not responding to
acyclovir or ribavirin.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.150
If it's some other virus,
we'll never find it in time anyway.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.778
Which leads us to bacterial infection.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.323
It's not responding to
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

08:52.449 --> 08:53.657
so we've got something resistant.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.867
The usual suspects.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.536
MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.164
Maybe contaminated food
or water source.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.916
Pseudomonas.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.167
VRE.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.919
H. flu.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.837
Okay. Those are the big ones.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.839
Cultures will take 48 hours.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.799
Might as well be postmortem.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.385
We'll start them
on vancomycin for the MRSA

09:13.511 --> 09:15.679
and aztreonam to cover the rest.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.182
Let's get MRIs, check for abscesses

09:18.308 --> 09:20.893
or some occult infection.
I'll be in the clinic.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.021
Grab me if you find something
important or unimportant.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.002
We did an MRI on all the babies,

10:28.128 --> 10:30.921
and, unfortunately,
we didn't find anything,

10:31.047 --> 10:34.967
so we're starting them on the strongest
antibiotics that we've got,

10:35.093 --> 10:38.137
and we're hoping that
that will take care of it.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.222
But he's so tiny.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.974
How sick is he?

10:42.559 --> 10:46.020
His fever's up to 103.5,
and his blood pressure is 80 over 40.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.022
How bad is that?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.153
It's low.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.030
The heart needs to circulate the blood.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.657
If it's weak,
the oxygen isn't getting to the liver,

10:58.783 --> 11:00.826
the kidneys, the brain.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.954
I have to ask you something.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.957
- Judy...
- No, no, Kim. Let me.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.253
I had a cold last month,
and I told the doctors about it.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.380
Honey, this has nothing to do with you.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.466
Kim's right.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.217
Your son was born healthy.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.386
He caught the infection
after his birth.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.265
There's no reason to think
that he caught it from you.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.976
But you don't know. I mean,

11:26.102 --> 11:28.103
you don't know how he got sick.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.986
Pretty standard question,
"How sick is my child?"

11:36.112 --> 11:37.613
- You couldn't answer.
- I answered.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.407
You rattled off numbers, BP, O2 sats.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.617
It's not what they need to know.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.787
What they need to know is the future.
You got a Magic 8 Ball?

11:44.913 --> 11:47.706
No, just eight years of
medical training.

11:50.210 --> 11:54.254
Look, I realize it's tough
to break bad news to families.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.465
Not as tough as hearing it.

11:56.591 --> 12:01.011
And I guess being the poor guy dying is
the toughest of all?

12:01.137 --> 12:06.058
No, it's easier to die
than to watch someone die.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.898
Well, we're checking the vents.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.858
It could be airborne.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.986
Somebody get the sinks, too,
and underneath them.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.613
I'll get it.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.991
How many med students
have you got swabbing the decks?

12:23.118 --> 12:24.410
What else are they gonna do?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.120
It's not like they're delivering
babies.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.704
You find anything yet?

12:27.831 --> 12:28.997
Yeah.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.543
About half the antibacterial
gel dispensers are empty or broken.

12:32.669 --> 12:36.338
That's bad, and yet diagnostically,
completely insignificant.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.675
Well, if the staff
can't wash their hands,

12:39.801 --> 12:41.593
it's no wonder an infection has spread.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.887
Hey, tie clip!

12:44.013 --> 12:46.181
- Sorry?
- We have an epidemic in this hospital,

12:46.307 --> 12:48.684
and your tie is becoming a petri dish.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.312
Put on a tie clip
or take the damn thing off.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.650
My joints
have been feeling all loose,

12:56.776 --> 12:59.278
and lately I've been feeling
sick a lot.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.696
Maybe I'm over-training.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.449
I'm doing the marathon,
like, 10 miles a day,

13:03.575 --> 13:05.409
but I can't seem to lose any weight.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.119
Lift up your arms.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.041
You have a parasite.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.501
Like a tapeworm or something?

13:14.627 --> 13:17.004
Lie back and lift up your sweater.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.174
You can put your arms down.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.717
Can you do anything about it?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.260
Only for about a month or so.

13:23.386 --> 13:26.680
After that it becomes illegal to
remove, except in a couple of states.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.973
Illegal?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.475
But don't worry.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.060
Many women learn to
embrace this parasite.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.771
They name it,
dress it up in tiny clothes,

13:34.898 --> 13:36.732
arrange play dates with
other parasites.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.692
Play dates?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.194
It has your eyes.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.823
But that's impossible.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.868
Well, I assume
you weren't getting your period.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.078
Maybe that should have given you
an inkling.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.830
But I'm on this birth-control implant.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.874
Yeah, I know.
I saw the scar on your arm.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.376
And my doctor said
I might not get any periods at all

13:56.503 --> 13:58.003
- if it was working.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.004
Interestingly enough,

13:59.130 --> 14:01.256
you also don't get any periods
if it isn't working,

14:01.382 --> 14:04.301
which is why you were supposed
to get regular pregnancy tests.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.845
I'm gonna send a nurse in here
to schedule your prenatal care.

14:06.971 --> 14:11.058
You're due in about five months,
so start planning the shower.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.769
Doctor?

14:13.895 --> 14:19.107
Please, me and my husband
wanted to have a kid soon,

14:19.234 --> 14:21.777
but, oh, God,

14:21.903 --> 14:26.031
like four months ago,
we had this really big fight.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.618
He moved out.
I did something stupid.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.871
- One-night stand?
- Ex-boyfriend.

14:34.249 --> 14:37.459
Well, I'll schedule you
a paternity test, too.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.045
I can't let my husband know.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.840
Does the old boyfriend
look like your husband?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.467
Yeah.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.886
Then just have the kid.
He'll never know.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.389
The most successful marriages
are based on lies.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.015
You're off to a great start.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.396
Well, you look cheery. What's going on?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.314
The Hartig and Chen-Lupino babies,

14:59.440 --> 15:00.774
their kidneys are shutting down.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.318
And the urine tests show no casts.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.155
Which means the antibiotics
are causing the kidney failure.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.700
You're the nephrologist.
Which one did it?

15:09.826 --> 15:12.035
We'll take them off that one.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.706
Don't tell me
both vancomycin and aztreonam.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.165
They both can cause this.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.376
There's no way to know which one it is.
No test.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.295
We can't take them off
the antibiotics though.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.588
They'll die of the infection.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.006
But if we leave them
on both the antibiotics,

15:24.132 --> 15:25.132
they'll die of kidney failure.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.509
So, we take our best guess then.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.261
Which drug's causing
the kidney failure?

15:29.387 --> 15:32.723
It's like I said,
it's always MRSA in hospitals.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.057
Take them off aztreonam.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.976
I still think it's the pseudomonas.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.145
I vote to take them off the vancomycin.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.987
There's no point in guessing.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.785
Take one kid off vancomycin,
the other off aztreonam.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.246
They have the same disease. You want to
give them different treatments?

15:56.372 --> 15:57.372
What the hell are you doing?

15:57.498 --> 16:00.584
Therapeutic trial,
to find the cause of the infection.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.085
That's wrong.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.630
We have four sick kids at least.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.007
Who knows how many more haven't started
showing symptoms yet.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.592
We have a duty to these two.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.177
If these two have different reactions,

16:10.303 --> 16:12.179
we'll know how to save the rest.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.264
So you're condemning
one of these kids to die

16:14.390 --> 16:16.475
based on random chance?

16:23.566 --> 16:24.941
I guess I am.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.746
So you're going to flip a coin.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.207
That's how you decide which baby lives.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.376
Can I borrow a quarter?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.587
Do you want to get sued,
lose your license, House?

16:45.713 --> 16:46.922
Well, generally, I'd applaud that,

16:47.048 --> 16:48.799
but my job is to protect this hospital,

16:48.925 --> 16:52.427
so I strongly advise you to come up
with a medical rationale

16:52.553 --> 16:54.763
why baby A should get medicine X
and vice versa.

16:54.889 --> 16:55.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.599
Hold on there, slick.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.934
We didn't all go to law school.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.018
Your advice is that I should use

17:00.144 --> 17:02.270
medical reasons
to make medical decisions?

17:02.397 --> 17:03.772
Hmm. That's not gonna be as easy.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.316
Any medical justification.
It doesn't need to be a good one.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.444
Well, Hartig sounds Jewish,
so does aztreonam,

17:09.570 --> 17:11.154
so we'll take the Hartig kid off
vancomycin.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.864
How's that?

17:12.990 --> 17:14.449
You can't experiment on babies.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.909
Doctors experiment all the time.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.828
On adults, with their consent.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.955
Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.498
Their informed consent.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.542
They have to know the other kid
is getting a different treatment.

17:23.668 --> 17:24.710
Sorry. Can't do that.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.002
It would be unethical for one patient

17:26.129 --> 17:27.963
to know about another patient's
treatment.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.382
- They have a right to know.
- If they know, they won't consent.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.759
That defeats the whole purpose.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.636
That's their right.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.347
Two more babies
have just become symptomatic.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.849
I defer to your legal wisdom.

17:38.975 --> 17:43.395
Which takes precedence, six dying
babies or a missing consent form?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.022
You can't do it.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.364
Do what you think is best.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.518
Your daughter's kidneys
are shutting down.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.979
Your son's kidneys are failing.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.898
So we're going to take her off
the aztreonam.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.858
We're taking him off vancomycin.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.944
But what...
What made her sick in the first place?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.780
What do you think is causing it?

18:34.906 --> 18:37.449
It seems to be a germ
called pseudomonas.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.952
We think it's MRSA
Methicillin-resistant Staph aureus.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.164
It's a very resistant form of
a very common bacteria.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.625
We're hoping
the aztreonam will clear it up.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.919
Vancomycin is
the best treatment for MRSA,

18:49.045 --> 18:50.879
so we're gonna keep giving it to her.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.798
Is it gonna cure her?

18:56.719 --> 18:58.762
Your child is very sick.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.263
You need to know that.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.474
This is a Hail Mary pass.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.309
It might cure her. It might not.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.983
So, that'll cure him?

19:14.487 --> 19:17.155
We'll know in 24 hours if it's working.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.841
- What did you tell them?
- I told them the truth.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.009
They seemed relieved.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.761
Did you tell them
how sick their son is?

19:39.887 --> 19:40.929
I explained what was going on.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.056
Allison, their baby's dying.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.808
If the parents weren't in tears
by the time you left,

19:44.934 --> 19:45.976
you didn't tell them the truth.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.769
That's not how I see it.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.271
Do you want them blindsided?

19:49.397 --> 19:50.605
Want them coming up
and saying, "My God,

19:50.731 --> 19:52.232
"my baby died.
Why didn't you warn me?"

19:52.358 --> 19:53.942
So now it's about worrying about
them yelling at us?

19:54.068 --> 19:57.445
No, it's about getting them prepared
for the likely death of their child.

19:57.572 --> 19:58.822
If their son dies tomorrow,

19:58.948 --> 20:01.116
you think they'll give a damn
what I said to them today?

20:01.242 --> 20:02.868
It's not gonna matter.
They're not gonna care.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.871
Nothing's gonna be the same ever again.

20:05.997 --> 20:09.124
Just give those poor women
a few hours of hope.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.048
- Dr. House!
- Oh, no.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.718
Dr. House, this is my husband, Charlie.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.761
Who told you where my office was?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.555
Jill, come on. He obviously doesn't
want us bothering him.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.892
I was trying to hide it.

20:27.018 --> 20:31.605
Look, Doctor, this is about the mono
that you said you thought I had.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.690
- The mono?
- Yes.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.026
You know, shouldn't Charlie be tested?

20:36.152 --> 20:40.238
You know, the test, the blood test.

20:40.990 --> 20:44.200
Right. Yeah, I'm sorry.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.077
I sometimes forget patients.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.746
I thought you were this idiot

20:47.872 --> 20:50.040
who doesn't know
how to use birth control.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.791
I can't have mono.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.210
I don't even feel sick or anything.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.381
That's very often the first sign.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.635
Call my office in the morning,
and I'll schedule you for blood tests.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.219
Thank you.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.763
I'm not even tired.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.056
Oh!

21:16.609 --> 21:17.734
Find anything yet?

21:17.860 --> 21:22.489
Just some baby formula being stored
under a sink with a dripping faucet.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.032
Tap water contamination.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.158
You thinking pseudomonas infection?

21:25.284 --> 21:28.036
I was. I wasted a couple of
hours chasing it down,

21:28.162 --> 21:31.957
but, of course, the formula
hasn't been anywhere near the babies.

21:32.083 --> 21:32.999
Whatever idiot stored them there...

21:33.125 --> 21:34.584
All right, we'll figure it out.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.379
- Just calm down.
- I am calm.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.839
Let me know
when you're gonna need it.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.008
- Oh, come...
- I warned you.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.636
I did that calmly.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.893
Hey.

21:52.019 --> 21:52.936
Hi.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.022
She any better?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.942
Her fever has been stable
the last hour.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.530
We're not gonna make it, are we?

22:03.656 --> 22:04.948
Sorry?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.117
Me and Ethan.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.372
Our next-door neighbor,

22:12.498 --> 22:14.040
her little boy died in a car crash,

22:14.166 --> 22:18.294
and she and her husband split up,
like, four months after the funeral.

22:18.421 --> 22:22.424
It's just what always happens, right?

22:27.138 --> 22:28.430
What happens to patients

22:28.556 --> 22:29.889
after they leave the hospital,
I don't know,

22:30.016 --> 22:32.976
but try not to get ahead of yourself.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.859
Dr. Chase,
ectopy on the monitor.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.318
How long?
I don't know. It just started.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.320
Pulse? Fluid, wide open.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.114
Do we have an arterial line? Not yet.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.033
Let's get a BP.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.704
- You can't come in here.
- Is my baby dying?

22:52.830 --> 22:53.955
- Mrs. Hartig...
- Is she dying?

22:54.081 --> 22:56.708
- Ma'am, you'll have to leave.
- It's not your baby.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.963
Ventilate.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.091
BP 60 over 20.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.426
Heart rate's 180.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.220
Start the Levophed.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.514
Still dropping, 50 over 10.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.062
I can't hold BP,
even with three pressors.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.607
I'm losing pulse.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.902
V-fib.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.403
Shut the blinds.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.874
- Charging.
- Set.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.250
Clear.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.088
Still V-fib.

23:43.214 --> 23:50.303
Charging. Clear.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.934
Still V-fib.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.063
Charging. Clear.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.485
- Charging.
- Chase.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.866
Time of death, 6:57 p.m.

24:34.515 --> 24:37.392
The aztreonam doesn't work.

24:37.518 --> 24:40.520
Double-cover all the other babies
with vancomycin.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.397
I'll do it.

24:42.523 --> 24:45.108
Cameron, tell the parents.

24:45.860 --> 24:50.321
Tell them their child
probably saved five lives.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.073
- But Chase should...
- Chase is busy.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.992
You're the attending.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.164
Make sure she does her job.

26:00.851 --> 26:03.853
I asked you to make sure
she does her job, not do it for her.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.021
She froze up.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.940
She felt sorry for the parents,
so she shut up.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.025
You felt sorry for her,
so you opened your mouth.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.360
She has a problem.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.527
She needs to deal with it.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.029
If you hadn't bailed her out,
she would have done it.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.698
Great. Then she wouldn't have slept
for two weeks.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.785
Maybe she should be thinking about
a different specialty.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.162
Lab work, research?

26:21.956 --> 26:24.040
- Yeah, what is it?
- The Hartig baby,

26:24.166 --> 26:25.959
she's getting sicker, too.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.795
The vancomycin isn't working either.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.634
Vancomycin doesn't kill it.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.344
Aztreonam doesn't kill it.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.181
What the hell is this?

26:40.307 --> 26:42.642
It's a superbug.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.852
It could be VRSA.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.188
There's only been two reported cases
ever in the United States.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.899
One of the kids, the Hausen baby,
had a skin rash.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.236
It could be scalded-skin syndrome,
which would be a sign of VRSA.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.320
Then these kids are dead.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.114
This is our fault.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.284
Doctors over-prescribing antibiotics.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.161
"Got a cold? Take some penicillin.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.997
"Sniffles? No problem.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.498
"Have some azithromycin.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.042
"Is that not working anymore?
Well, got your Levaquin."

27:08.168 --> 27:10.670
Antibacterial soaps in every bathroom.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.923
They'll be adding vancomycin
to the water supply soon.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.717
We bred these superbugs.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.011
They're our babies,
and they're all grown up,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.888
and they've got body piercings
and a lot of anger.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.060
On the other hand,

27:26.186 --> 27:28.521
maybe antibiotics
had nothing to do with it.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.484
Did you notice
how low his BP was at the end,

27:33.610 --> 27:35.945
even with three pressors?

27:36.071 --> 27:37.405
Heart damage?

27:40.326 --> 27:41.326
Go home.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.119
There's nothing more
you can do tonight.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.391
Baby boy Chen-Lupino.

28:07.519 --> 28:12.315
Time of death 6:57 p.m., Thursday,
December 2nd, 2004.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.393
This is a cross section of the
Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium.

28:48.519 --> 28:51.062
Fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.857
There was no sign of
lymphocytosis in the blood tests.

28:54.983 --> 28:58.277
Yes, well, we all had plenty of
good reasons to think bacterial.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.987
Nobody is scolding you.

29:00.114 --> 29:02.907
Unfortunately,
all those clever reasons were wrong.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.201
It is a virus infecting their hearts.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.494
Man, we're screwed.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.789
We can't chase down a virus.
There's a thousand possibilities.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.791
We could run gels, antibody tests.

29:11.917 --> 29:12.917
A thousand of them?

29:13.043 --> 29:13.918
The kids don't have enough blood.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.461
Chase, you're the intensivist.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.047
How many could we do before we risk
exsanguinating the kids?

29:18.173 --> 29:20.466
You're talking vials, not stick tests?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.260
I wouldn't take more than five or six.

29:22.386 --> 29:28.391
Okay, so we have to narrow
the thousand viruses down to six.

29:28.517 --> 29:32.061
Now, the autopsy's shown us
what the virus does,

29:32.187 --> 29:33.980
so let's go. What do we know?

29:34.106 --> 29:36.441
That ribavirin and acyclovir
don't knock it out.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.109
Cross out the herpes viruses.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.195
Also adenovirus.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.864
What else? What else? Keep talking!

29:42.990 --> 29:45.032
Well, it only seems to hit children.

29:45.159 --> 29:46.200
The mothers aren't sick, so...

29:46.326 --> 29:48.995
No toxoplasmosis, no rubella.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.371
Cross out the entire TORCH Syndrome.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.623
- You didn't find any lung damage?
- No.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.709
None of the Paramyxoviridae.

29:54.835 --> 29:57.044
Cardiac scarring, people.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.296
CMV.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.968
Enteroviruses, too, I think.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.971
11.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.473
Influenza A.

30:09.183 --> 30:10.183
Flu A.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.438
Yes, and?

30:28.577 --> 30:31.621
I'm putting RSV down as a yes.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.998
That makes eight.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.958
Eight vials of blood is pushing it.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.044
Pushing it? Well, we love that.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.213
Get the antibody kits,
start testing the sick kids.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.465
All right, I'll look into
whether there are any antivirals

30:42.591 --> 30:43.758
for these eight.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.009
Wait a second, did...

30:45.135 --> 30:46.928
The kids on the floor
who didn't get sick,

30:47.054 --> 30:48.679
are any of them still in the hospital?

30:48.805 --> 30:50.223
They got moved to the fifth floor,

30:50.349 --> 30:51.974
but they're probably
all checked out by now.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.559
No, the Limpert boy
had a bit of jaundice.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.727
He's checking out today.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.521
- I want to test his blood, too.
- Why?

30:56.647 --> 30:58.689
Because we need
all the information we can get.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.274
The healthy kid
can be our control group.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.235
I'll just tell his parents

31:02.361 --> 31:05.112
he can't check out
because he has the smallpox.

31:07.908 --> 31:11.160
Stephen Morgan, contact
hospital administration.

31:14.873 --> 31:19.168
Dr. Paul to the recovery room.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.129
All done. All done.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.093
What did we get?

31:27.219 --> 31:30.179
Well, the sick babies all tested
positive for Echovirus 11.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.889
Great. And CMV

31:32.015 --> 31:33.766
and Parvovirus B19.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.976
Three viruses?

31:35.102 --> 31:37.061
But what's weirder,
the healthy kid we tested,

31:37.187 --> 31:40.982
he's positive for Echovirus 11
and CMV antibodies, as well.

31:45.696 --> 31:48.155
And they're infants.

31:49.157 --> 31:52.493
They have their mothers' blood,
their mothers' antibodies.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.911
So we've just learned nothing?

31:54.037 --> 31:55.538
Uh-uh. We have half the picture.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.958
The healthy kids survived because
their mothers' antibodies saved them.

31:59.084 --> 32:02.211
If the mom had CMV in the past,
she'd have the antibodies for CMV.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.839
The kid would be immune from it.

32:04.965 --> 32:08.968
So, we test the sick kids' moms
for Echovirus, CMV and Parvovirus.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.970
And whichever they don't have
the antibodies for,

32:11.096 --> 32:13.598
that's what's killing their kids.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.600
I'll test the mothers.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.938
Inhalation therapist,
2P 214.

32:21.064 --> 32:24.400
Inhalation therapist,
pediatric room 214.

32:34.536 --> 32:36.912
Dr. Kent's office on the line.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.540
Dr. Kent's office on the line.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.979
Echovirus 11.
It's an Enterovirus.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.023
It lodges in the intestinal tract.

33:04.149 --> 33:07.526
Enteroviruses cause diarrhea
and flu-like symptoms in adults,

33:07.653 --> 33:12.448
maybe a rash,
but for newborns, it can be deadly.

33:12.574 --> 33:15.117
It's damaging her heart.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.994
Well, is there anything you can do?

33:17.120 --> 33:20.831
Viruses are more difficult to treat
than bacterial infections.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.750
We still haven't found a cure
for the common cold.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.044
So, you mean there's no vaccine or...

33:25.170 --> 33:27.588
There's a company in Pennsylvania
developing an antiviral.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.548
It got positive results
in a lab setting,

33:29.675 --> 33:32.009
and we managed to get our hands on it.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.484
Imagine not being able
to touch your own baby.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.197
Can I get your guys' help
with something?

33:53.323 --> 33:54.824
Sure.

33:54.950 --> 33:55.991
Your daughter, her...

33:56.118 --> 33:57.660
Maxine.

33:57.786 --> 34:01.038
That's her name. Maxine.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.875
We need someone
to hold Maxine up off the bed

34:05.001 --> 34:06.502
while the nurse changes her sheet.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.379
Sure. Okay.

34:11.425 --> 34:15.761
Look at you. Hi. Hold still.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.601
That's it.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.150
Hi. Easy.

34:31.153 --> 34:32.528
There you go.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.691
Hey, Foreman. Got a minute?

35:18.575 --> 35:22.870
So, pulmonary resistance has stabilized
for the two kids, but BP's still...

35:22.996 --> 35:26.290
No news then. How's Cameron?

35:26.416 --> 35:28.083
Dr. Cameron?

35:28.210 --> 35:30.878
Sure. Let's start with her
and then move on

35:31.004 --> 35:32.546
to all the other Camerons we know.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.715
I'm sorry.
I'm just not used to you asking

35:34.841 --> 35:35.883
about someone's well-being.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.135
I can understand how the question would
surprise you.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.887
I don't quite get
how it would confuse you.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.139
Why do you wanna know?

35:42.265 --> 35:43.933
Why do you wanna know
why I want to know?

35:44.059 --> 35:45.601
Just curious.

35:45.727 --> 35:46.894
Me, too.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.687
You don't get curious.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.439
I'm the most curious man in the world.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.649
Not about trivialities.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.609
Well, then this must not be trivial.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.906
How is Cameron handling everything?

35:59.032 --> 36:00.825
Just fine.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.579
Great. Glad we talked.

36:11.253 --> 36:15.214
Your husband is definitely
the source of your mono.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.715
Oh!

36:16.842 --> 36:19.718
Wow! Oh, thank God.

36:20.053 --> 36:23.931
Wow, I'm gonna be a mom. Whoa!

36:25.183 --> 36:26.725
Thank you so much.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.936
I got to get you a gift or something.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.981
Sometimes the best gift is the gift of
never seeing you again.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.358
Okay. All right.

36:34.484 --> 36:38.112
But, Dr. House,
you've been so awesome.

36:38.238 --> 36:42.741
I mean, I really totally trust you.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.827
- Do you think you...
- No.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.996
...could do the prenatal...
- No.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.497
...or deliver the baby?

36:48.623 --> 36:50.457
- That would be no.
- Okay.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.132
Well...

37:36.004 --> 37:38.172
Chase, take a look at this.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.650
Oh, God.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.234
It's good news.

37:59.361 --> 38:00.736
No. It's great.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.034
Thank you.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.881
Hi. She's doing great.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.967
Hi, there.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.232
They all gone?

38:38.358 --> 38:40.109
Hartigs are checking out right now.

38:41.695 --> 38:42.861
You look tired.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.113
Thanks.

38:45.448 --> 38:49.952
It's no wonder. You've had a hard time
the last couple of days.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.079
And you haven't?

38:52.205 --> 38:53.706
Not like you.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.294
Anyone who's that awkward

38:59.421 --> 39:03.799
either has no experience with death
or too much,

39:03.925 --> 39:06.635
and I'm pretty sure
it's not the former.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.638
Chase told me about that idea you had,

39:09.764 --> 39:13.308
the parents holding the baby.
Where'd you get that?

39:16.312 --> 39:18.105
Did you lose someone?

39:20.567 --> 39:22.317
Did you lose a baby?

39:24.988 --> 39:27.197
You can be a real bastard.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.637
Unfinished business?

40:33.223 --> 40:34.973
- I'm in the haystack.
- Ah!

40:35.100 --> 40:36.975
Because now you know
you're looking for a needle.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.644
Right.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.981
If I tell you to let it go,
it won't make any difference, will it?

40:43.108 --> 40:45.651
Enteroviruses are spread by humans.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.736
Fecal or oral usually.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.322
It could be respiratory secretions
though.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.407
So Cuddy got stool samples
from the whole staff.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.159
- Just wait till they come back.
- That won't do it.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.327
Why not?

40:55.453 --> 40:57.246
The shedder, whoever he is,

40:57.372 --> 40:59.873
he's so virulent,
he must have been symptomatic.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.209
- Cuddy would have noticed him.
- Hmm.

41:02.335 --> 41:05.712
And the babies didn't share
any common personnel.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.339
That's what's weird.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.925
Yeah, yeah. That's what's weird.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.969
Transition team to OR 2.

41:12.095 --> 41:13.971
Transition team to OR 2.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.525
Can I help you?

42:12.947 --> 42:14.948
You saved my life.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.034
I just ran some tests.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.661
Your will and determination are
what saved your life.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.622
I know who I am now.

42:21.748 --> 42:23.248
Yes, you do.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.000
And I know who I am, as well.

42:25.126 --> 42:26.835
Naomi, I love you.

42:26.961 --> 42:30.047
Hey, seriously, man.
You're not supposed to be here.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.799
I'm performing a delivery.

42:32.926 --> 42:33.967
You are?

42:34.093 --> 42:36.178
A patient whose prenatal care
I've been handling.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.847
I just took her on
a couple of minutes ago.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.934
Of course, I'll need one of
you two guys to supervise.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.436
- When's she due?
- Late March.

42:45.855 --> 42:48.857
That's five months from now.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.568
Thank God,
these chairs are comfortable.
