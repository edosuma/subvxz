Marge, I'm bored.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.234
Why don't you
read something?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.904
Because I'm trying
to reduce my boredom.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.072
Well, you could hand out
these flyers

01:12.155 --> 01:14.449
for the neighborhood
rummage sale.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.785
You'd get some fresh air
and exercise.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.953
Eh, I'll do it anyway.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.498
Come on, boy. We're going

01:24.918 --> 01:26.586
Good old Evergreen Terrace...

01:26.669 --> 01:28.088
the swankiest street

01:28.171 --> 01:30.799
in the classiest part
of Pressboard Estates.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.009
If you love it so much,
why are you always littering?

until they fix that
malfunctioning Squishee machine.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.351
HOMER:
Hey, I never noticed this place.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.062
Dad, it's right across
the street from us.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.565
That fancy house
will never sell.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.983
Nobody who could afford it

02:30.066 --> 02:31.359
would want to live in
this neighborhood.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.111
Hey, what's wrong
with this neighborhood?

02:33.194 --> 02:36.781
Big shot! Too good to buy
a house here, snobby?

02:36.865 --> 02:37.991
Who are you
talking to, Homer?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.409
The guy who
doesn't live there.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.703
Can we get rid
of this Ayatollah t-shirt?

02:41.786 --> 02:43.997
Khomeini died years ago.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.457
But, Marge,
it works on any Ayatollah.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.627
Ayatollah Nakhbadeh,
Ayatollah Zahedi...

02:49.711 --> 02:51.504
even as we speak,
Ayatollah Razmara

02:51.588 --> 02:54.382
and his cadre of fanatics
are consolidating their power.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.427
I don't care who's
consolidating their power.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.137
Well, we don't need this.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.724
But, Marge, that's the
Rhinestone Nights fashion gun.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.226
I need it to rhinestone up
my old clothing.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.769
Who's Disco Stu?

03:06.853 --> 03:09.647
I wanted to write disco stud,
but I ran out of space.

03:09.731 --> 03:13.151
Not that Disco Stu didn't get
his share of the action.

03:17.405 --> 03:20.408
So if you're looking for
a half bag of charcoal briquettes

03:20.491 --> 03:22.744
or an artificial
Christmas tree-- trunk only--

03:22.827 --> 03:25.163
come on over
to the Hibbard table, pronto.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.497
Well, sir, looks like we got

03:26.581 --> 03:28.458
some nice items
here at table Glick.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.252
Like this... what the
heckaroonie is this, Mrs. Glick?

03:31.336 --> 03:34.255
It is a candy dish, Ned. $90.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.507
Uh-huh. Well, I, uh...

03:36.591 --> 03:38.593
I guess you could put
a lot of nice things in there.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.512
No! Just candy, Ned. $90.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.394
Well, looks like
somebody sold something today.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.233
Are you interested
in that motorized tie rack,

03:53.316 --> 03:54.609
Principal Skinner?

03:54.692 --> 03:56.986
(motor whirring)

03:57.070 --> 03:58.529
Hmm... it's
awfully loud.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.574
Well, you can always
take the motor out

04:01.658 --> 04:03.785
and use it
as an ordinary tie rack.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.079
But now the ties
are motionless

04:06.162 --> 04:08.957
and those in back are
virtually inaccessible.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.291
Well, it's a moot point,

04:10.375 --> 04:11.918
as I have only one
tie to begin with.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.087
I believe I'll pass.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.173
Have you sold
that tie rack yet?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.383
-No.
-I'll take it.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.593
Now, folks,
nothing spells fun

04:20.677 --> 04:23.680
like rhinestones
on a dungaree jacket.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.139
Stu, you should
buy that.

04:25.223 --> 04:29.185
Hey, Disco Stu
doesn't advertise.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.355
Uh... hey, Ned, let me
help you with that.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.066
Hey, everybody! Who thinks
Flanders should shut up?

04:35.149 --> 04:36.150
(all yelling in agreement)

04:38.111 --> 04:41.364
So, anyone here from
Evergreen Terrace?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.157
(applause and cheering)

04:43.241 --> 04:45.535
I think this is
the best neighborhood in town.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.953
Anybody agree with me?

04:47.036 --> 04:47.954
(cheering)

04:48.037 --> 04:49.664
You're the king, Homer!

04:49.747 --> 04:51.249
King of the neighborhood.

04:51.332 --> 04:55.545
Say, that Ayatollah
thinks he's better than America.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.671
Is he right?

04:56.754 --> 04:58.089
(booing)

04:58.172 --> 04:59.841
MAN:
Yes.

04:59.924 --> 05:03.845
Well, for only five dollars,
you can sock it to him in style.

05:03.928 --> 05:04.887
Right here!

05:04.971 --> 05:06.264
And for the man

05:06.347 --> 05:09.475
who has everything,
a tie rack motor.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.852
I'll take that.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.096
Hi there, neighbors.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.014
I'm... George Bush.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.020
Former President George Bush?

06:36.104 --> 06:38.815
(murmurs of recognition)

06:38.898 --> 06:42.610
HOMER: Okay, let's give it up
for the new guy.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.280
Now let's all turn around
and pay attention to me again.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.615
Hello?

06:47.698 --> 06:49.784
Hello?

06:49.867 --> 06:51.035
Hello?

06:54.747 --> 06:58.459
Wow! A former President
living right across the street.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.878
Oh! Why did he have
to move in on my territory?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.338
Look at him.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.132
Thinks just because
he led the free world

07:04.215 --> 07:05.633
he can act like a big shot.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.385
Stupid President.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.679
Why couldn't he just stay
in his own state?

07:09.762 --> 07:10.972
Actually, this is one
of the nine states

07:11.055 --> 07:13.724
where Mr. Bush
claims residency, Dad.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.518
I wouldn't have
voted for him

07:15.601 --> 07:17.228
but it's nice to have a
celebrity in the neighborhood.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.688
Wait a minute.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.523
If Lisa didn't vote for him

07:20.606 --> 07:22.358
and I didn't vote for him...

07:22.442 --> 07:24.110
You didn't vote
for anybody.

07:24.193 --> 07:27.989
I voted for Prell to go back
to the old glass bottle.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.116
After that,
I became deeply cynical.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.910
And your business
here, Mr. Flanders?

07:32.994 --> 07:35.121
Well, sir,
I'm welcoming the Bushes

07:35.204 --> 07:36.581
on behalf of the
Neighborhood Association.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.709
Never mind
about that, Ray.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.294
Just give them a quick pass
with the metal detector

07:41.377 --> 07:42.795
and let them on in.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.589
Hey, Bar!
The neighbors are here.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.550
Howdily-doodily there,
President Bush

07:47.633 --> 07:50.136
or should I say
President neighbor?

07:50.219 --> 07:53.806
I'm Ned Flanders and this
is Maude, Rod and Todd.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.017
Well, howdily-doodily
yourself there, Ned.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.643
This is my wife, Barbara.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.770
Call her Bar.
Would you like some lemonade?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.731
-Tip-top-notch!
-Okily-dokily.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.441
Thankily-dankily.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.442
Greatalicious!

08:04.525 --> 08:05.693
Scrumpdiddlerific!

08:05.776 --> 08:07.945
BOTH: Fine and dandy
like sour candy.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.155
Bar's a whiz
with cold drinks

08:09.238 --> 08:10.323
aren't you, Bar?

08:10.406 --> 08:12.033
Don't understand
lemonade myself.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.868
Not my forte.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.328
What brings you
to Springfield?

08:15.411 --> 08:16.829
Well, George and I

08:16.913 --> 08:18.372
just wanted to be
private citizens again...

08:18.456 --> 08:20.750
go where nobody cared
about politics.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.210
So we found the town

08:22.293 --> 08:24.337
with the lowest voter
turnout in America.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.048
Just happy to be here
among good, average people

08:27.131 --> 08:30.009
with no particular
hopes or dreams.

08:30.092 --> 08:34.013
But, Mr. President,
we're not all good people.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.432
There's one little boy
you should watch out for.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.601
He's a bad,
bad little boy.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.852
(laughing nervously)

08:39.936 --> 08:41.562
Now, Todd,
don't scare the President.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.740
(panting)

08:56.536 --> 08:59.747
Huh... look at those phonies,
sucking up to Bush.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.166
(whimpering)

09:02.250 --> 09:03.960
(barking)

09:04.043 --> 09:08.798
I guess you might say he's
barking up the wrong Bush.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.800
HOMER'S BRAIN:
<i>There it is, Homer.</i>

09:10.883 --> 09:12.593
<i>The cleverest thing you'll</i>
<i>ever say and nobody heard it.</i>

09:12.677 --> 09:13.553
D'oh!

09:15.596 --> 09:16.514
Ah!

09:16.597 --> 09:17.890
Just going to relax

09:17.974 --> 09:20.393
with my U.S. News and World
whatnot.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.519
Oh, good.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.146
They're roasting the new guy.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.316
(imitating Dennis the Menace)
Hello... Mr. Bush!

09:27.400 --> 09:28.734
George...

09:28.818 --> 09:30.820
this is a neighborhood
boy, Bart Simpson.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.572
He came over
to say hi.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.823
(quietly)
Hello.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.533
Hi! Hey, what's this?

09:35.616 --> 09:37.577
My electric card shuffler.
Don't go near the--

09:39.161 --> 09:40.913
Now, I told you.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.249
Oh... those cards
were from Air Force One

09:43.332 --> 09:45.543
and they only give you
so many packs.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.420
Oh, George,
boys will be boys.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.130
Bart's just being friendly.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.882
Why don't you get off that sofa
and show Bart your photos?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.551
Oh, he'll gunk
them all up.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.345
His hands are probably covered
with mud and cookies.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.347
Well...

09:58.431 --> 10:00.933
(muttering)
Probably stole a napkin.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.476
Who's that, George?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.103
That's me with
Charlton Heston. He was...

10:04.186 --> 10:05.438
Who's that, George?

10:05.521 --> 10:07.148
Now see, you
wouldn't know him.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.150
That's Bob Mosbacher,
He was Secretary of...

10:09.233 --> 10:11.110
That's a dumb name.
Who's that, George?

10:11.193 --> 10:13.362
Maybe he thinks Bart
is a dumb name.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.947
How many times were
you President, George?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.365
Just once.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.284
Bar, isn't it time
for dinner yet?

10:18.367 --> 10:21.120
I'm making rice.
It'll be a while.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.288
Did your
Secret Service goons

10:22.371 --> 10:23.372
ever whack anybody,
George?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.666
You know, in my day,

10:25.750 --> 10:29.170
little boys didn't call their
elders by their first names.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.964
Yeah, well, welcome
to the 20th century, George.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.884
(muttering) I'll kick you right out of
the 20th century, you little...

10:36.344 --> 10:38.054
(tires screeching)

10:38.137 --> 10:39.597
Oh, man! I only got one minute
till they stop serving

10:39.680 --> 10:42.058
those breakfast balls. D'oh!

10:42.141 --> 10:43.351
Let's see now.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.311
What do you folks
have here, huh?

10:45.394 --> 10:47.396
Hmm, a Krusty Burger.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.939
That doesn't sound
too appetizing.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.608
What kind of stew
do you have today?

10:50.691 --> 10:52.902
<i>Uh, we don't have stew.</i>

10:52.985 --> 10:54.362
(honking)

10:54.445 --> 10:56.322
Sir, why don't you just
have the cheeseburger?

10:56.405 --> 10:58.991
Oh, that's really more
of a weekend thing, Ray.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.494
Hey, jerk!
Move your fanny!

11:01.577 --> 11:03.204
That guy is louder
than World War II.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.331
Ray, go see what
the rhubarb is, will you?

11:05.414 --> 11:07.166
(honking)

11:07.249 --> 11:09.543
Sir, could you
pop your hood?

11:09.627 --> 11:12.004
(horn braying)

11:12.088 --> 11:14.507
Hey! My taxes paid
for that horn.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.550
Why, hello, Mrs. Bush.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.760
Hi, Bart.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.970
Mr. Bush is
upstairs napping.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.722
You know, your husband's
awful grumpy.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.641
Oh, that's just his way.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.267
He really likes you.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.769
You know, it's time
for him to get up

11:26.852 --> 11:28.270
and work on his memoirs.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.814
Why don't you
go wake him?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.149
(horn sounding)

11:32.233 --> 11:33.317
What? What the--

11:33.401 --> 11:34.860
Great Scott, don't touch that.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.988
That's the alpenhorn
Helmut Kohl gave me.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.365
Where'd you get
those pajamas?

11:39.448 --> 11:41.117
They're presidential pajamas.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.619
You have to be president,
and you're not president.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.620
Yes, I am.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.622
No, you're not! Bar!

11:50.751 --> 11:52.169
Hey, where's your candy?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.171
We don't have any.
Now, go away.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.173
George!

11:56.257 --> 11:58.300
Older people don't eat
much candy, Bart

11:58.384 --> 12:01.804
but I could bake you
some cookies if you like.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.390
(muttering) Can't remember the last time
she made cookies for me.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.058
-What's that?
-Oh, nothing.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.268
HOMER:
All right.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.061
His story checks out.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.398
Marge, would you love me
more if I were President?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.108
'Cause I'll do it
if it'll make you happy.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.401
Homie, as long
as you keep

12:15.484 --> 12:18.279
the car full of gas,
I'm happy.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.824
Well, she can always
depend on that.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.704
-(typing)
-And since I'd achieved

12:26.787 --> 12:31.041
all my goals as President
in one term

12:31.125 --> 12:33.753
there was no need for a second.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.843
Hmm... good memoirs.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.303
Good, not great.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.054
Now, let's look
at that old outboard.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.223
Soup that baby up,
rattle a few windows

12:46.307 --> 12:48.309
down in Kennebunkport
next May.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.729
Hello... Mr. Bush!

12:55.399 --> 12:56.442
What you doing?

12:56.525 --> 12:58.486
Don't upset the desk there.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.737
Careful! Don't want
to horse around with...

12:59.820 --> 13:01.238
Hey, cool! What does this do?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.032
Now don't you pull that cord,
young man!

13:03.115 --> 13:04.533
(engine revving)

13:04.617 --> 13:06.118
GEORGE: Now look what you did.
Whoops! Hey!

13:06.202 --> 13:08.621
Bar, my motor's gone loco!

13:08.704 --> 13:10.831
Oh! The birdhouse.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.625
My prize orchids!

13:23.385 --> 13:25.304
Oh, no!
Not the memoirs.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.305
Don't even
think about it.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.306
Not gonna happen.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.022
(groans)

13:35.105 --> 13:37.316
(engine stops)

13:37.399 --> 13:38.317
Whoa, man.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.777
Whoa, nothing.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.278
I'm going to do something

13:41.362 --> 13:44.365
your Daddy should
have done a long time ago.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.703
Now go home and think about
what you've done, young man.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.000
He spanked you?

13:55.084 --> 13:56.794
You? Bart Simpson?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.337
I begged him to stop

13:58.420 --> 14:00.422
but he said it was
for the good of the nation.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.966
Big deal.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.509
When I was a pup,
we got spanked by Presidents

14:03.592 --> 14:05.177
till the cows came home.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.679
Grover Cleveland spanked me

14:06.762 --> 14:08.973
on two non-consecutive
occasions.

14:09.056 --> 14:12.518
Grampa, I know in your day,
spanking was common

14:12.601 --> 14:14.144
but Homer and I
just don't believe

14:14.228 --> 14:15.855
in that kind of punishment.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.524
And that's why your no-good
kids are running wild!

14:19.984 --> 14:21.443
First, Bush invades
my home turf,

14:21.527 --> 14:23.028
then he takes my pals,

14:23.112 --> 14:25.865
then he makes fun
of the way I talk... probably.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.575
Now he steals my right

14:27.658 --> 14:30.411
to raise a disobedient,
smart-alecky son!

14:30.494 --> 14:32.413
Well, that's it!

14:34.206 --> 14:35.583
Hey, Bush!

14:35.666 --> 14:37.376
Get out here!

14:37.459 --> 14:40.129
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.381
I'm going to punch
George Bush in the face.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.550
Okay. Is he expecting you?

14:44.633 --> 14:45.926
You owe me
an apology.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.845
Hey, you owe me
an apology.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.597
If you were
any kind of a father

14:49.680 --> 14:52.641
you'd have disciplined
that boy a long time ago.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.393
You want to step back, sir?

14:54.476 --> 14:56.604
-You're trampling the flowers.
-Ooh!

14:56.687 --> 14:59.523
Hiding behind your goons,
eh, Bush?

14:59.607 --> 15:00.566
Oh!

15:00.649 --> 15:03.861
Well, you are a wimp!

15:05.613 --> 15:07.114
Wimp... am I?

15:07.197 --> 15:08.449
Agent Johnson?

15:08.532 --> 15:10.034
Agent Heintz?

15:10.117 --> 15:11.410
You men, stand down.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.541
All right, mister.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.460
You want trouble,
you're going to get trouble.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.545
Oh, I want trouble, all right.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.796
Then you're going
to get trouble.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.590
No, you're going
to get trouble.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.217
Oh, that's good, that's good
'cause I want trouble.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.218
Then we're agreed

15:28.302 --> 15:29.637
there'll be trouble.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.639
Oh, yeah,
lots of trouble.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.641
-Trouble, it is.
-For you.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.184
-For... D'oh!
-(door slams)

15:37.353 --> 15:39.813
(chuckles)
This is gonna be sweet.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.399
200 bottle rockets,
and George Bush

15:42.483 --> 15:44.485
doing toe-touches
by an open window.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.486
BART: If you get one
up his butt,

15:45.569 --> 15:46.487
it's a million points.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.156
(sizzling)

15:49.239 --> 15:50.199
(whistling)

15:50.282 --> 15:51.533
(booming)

15:53.744 --> 15:55.537
BARBARA:
Why don't you just

15:55.621 --> 15:57.289
say you're
sorry, George?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.290
Because I'm right.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.833
Oh, no.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.877
I'm going to fix
their wagon good.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.796
I've pulled some pranks
in my time.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.048
(rattling)

16:06.131 --> 16:08.509
DR. HIBBERT:
Uh, I don't understand.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.678
Are you saying you and
Barbara are bad neighbors?

16:10.761 --> 16:13.597
No, that's not Bar
and me, it's them.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.057
Who? Maude and me?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.642
No, the man
and his boy.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.603
You know, the...
the boy is named Bart.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.980
I don't know the
name of the man.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.815
Bar, what's the
name of the man?

16:22.898 --> 16:24.441
I'm not getting
involved, George.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.442
Look, just never mind.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.735
I thought the banner

16:26.819 --> 16:28.278
was pretty
straightforward

16:28.362 --> 16:29.863
but... guess I'll
just take it down.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.699
BARBARA:
George...

16:31.782 --> 16:33.117
it's time to
get dressed.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.952
Nuh-uh. I'm not
going outside today,

16:35.035 --> 16:36.620
not with those
neighbors.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.456
Staying right here till
my speech to the Elks Club.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.457
(knocking)

16:40.541 --> 16:41.834
HOMER:
Yoo-hoo.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.879
Who is it?

16:45.963 --> 16:48.340
HOMER: It's your sons,
George Bush, Jr. and Jeb Bush.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.800
Come outside, Dad.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.218
Oh, good.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.386
Bar, the boys are out
in the front yard.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.804
They'll help me
think of a plan

16:53.887 --> 16:55.180
to get those
Simpsons.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.224
Oh, George, is that all
you ever think about?

16:57.307 --> 16:59.977
The boys probably just want a
letter of recommendation.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.857
Boys? Where
you going?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.316
Okay, son, give him the glue.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.653
(Homer grunting)

17:09.737 --> 17:12.114
(Homer and Bart laughing)

17:12.197 --> 17:14.116
HOMER:
Hey, looking good!

17:16.410 --> 17:18.370
GEORGE:
And that's why I will continue

17:18.454 --> 17:22.958
to oppose teen alcoholism
in all its forms.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.839
Now, are there any questions?

17:28.922 --> 17:33.510
Keeping in mind that I already
explained about my hair.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.554
(mumbling)
Oh, yeah, that's right.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.016
(engine revving)

17:40.476 --> 17:42.394
(tires squealing)

17:42.478 --> 17:44.438
(mud splattering)

17:44.521 --> 17:47.316
President Bush is
driving on our lawn.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.525
He must be lost.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.360
He's not lost.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.737
Looks like we're
experiencing

17:51.820 --> 17:53.280
some blow-back from
the wig offensive.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.948
It's time to hit
him where he lives.

17:55.032 --> 17:55.949
His house?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.034
Bingo.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.082
So I thought to myself

18:03.165 --> 18:05.042
'what would God do
in this situation?'

18:05.125 --> 18:06.043
(buzzing)

18:06.126 --> 18:07.419
(snickering)
Locusts...

18:07.503 --> 18:08.796
They'll drive him nuts.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.422
It's all in the Bible, son.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.508
It's the prankster's Bible.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.218
(engine revving)

18:20.557 --> 18:25.312
Hmm. Can't decide if this'll
be considered feisty or crazy.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.438
Hey! Hey, what the..?

18:28.315 --> 18:31.110
Ohh, if he thinks George Bush
will stay out of the sewer

18:31.193 --> 18:33.153
he doesn't know George Bush.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.366
Hey, turkeys, behind you.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.410
For the last time, Bush,
apologize for spanking my boy.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.995
Never.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.164
You make him apologize
for destroying my memoirs.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.334
You didn't tell me you
destroyed his memoirs.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.627
Never!

19:00.013 --> 19:01.431
Yay, Dad!

19:01.515 --> 19:04.309
I really feel awful
about your lawn, Marge.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.519
George can be
so stubborn

19:05.602 --> 19:07.104
when he thinks
he's right.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.648
Well, Homer too.
They're so much alike.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.775
Too bad they got off
on the wrong foot.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.361
It's just like
the Noriega thing.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.573
Now, he and George are
the best of friends.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.576
(both panting)

19:20.659 --> 19:23.912
Here's a little something
we learned in C.I.A.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.374
(buzzing)

19:27.457 --> 19:28.417
Get him, boys.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.377
(buzzing)

19:37.092 --> 19:38.218
(doorbell ringing)

19:38.302 --> 19:40.345
Hello?

19:40.429 --> 19:41.388
Hello?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.349
(buzzing)

19:50.731 --> 19:53.567
I'll ruin you like
a Japanese banquet.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.736
I'll take your
head, and...

19:55.819 --> 19:56.820
Gorbachev.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.988
(nervous chuckling)

19:58.071 --> 19:59.823
What are you
doing here?

19:59.907 --> 20:02.618
I just dropped by with present
for warming of house.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.746
Instead, find you
grappling with local oaf.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.789
Oh, brought some of
your commie friends

20:07.873 --> 20:09.541
to help you
fight dirty, eh?

20:09.625 --> 20:12.252
But, Mikhail, he put
a wig on my head,

20:12.336 --> 20:13.253
my memoirs...

20:13.337 --> 20:14.254
BARBARA: George...

20:14.338 --> 20:15.547
this is the last straw.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.758
You apologize
to Homer right now.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.177
But, Bar, we can't
show any weakness

20:20.260 --> 20:21.595
in front of
the Russians.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.847
George.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.852
Yes, dear.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.438
(speaking Russian)

20:31.521 --> 20:32.940
(laughing)

20:34.233 --> 20:35.609
Okay.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.320
I'm sorry I spanked
your boy, Homer.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.446
Woo hoo!

20:39.529 --> 20:41.240
In your face, Bush!

20:41.323 --> 20:42.741
Now, apologize
for the tax hike.

20:49.122 --> 20:50.874
It's a shame it didn't
work out, Marge

20:50.958 --> 20:53.585
but George just felt
this neighborhood

20:53.669 --> 20:54.836
brought out the worst
in him, and...

20:54.920 --> 20:56.463
(honking)

20:56.546 --> 20:57.798
(honking)

20:59.925 --> 21:00.842
Oh, my.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.386
Well, so long.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.767
Bye-bye.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.654
Hi.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.533
Pleased to meet you.
I just moved in.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.868
My name is Jerry Ford.

21:26.952 --> 21:27.911
(gasping)

21:27.995 --> 21:29.663
Former President Gerald Ford?

21:29.746 --> 21:31.873
Put her there.
I'm Homer Simpson.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.043
Say, Homer,
do you like football?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.586
Do I ever?

21:36.670 --> 21:38.547
Do you like nachos?

21:38.630 --> 21:40.257
Yes, Mr. Ford.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.258
Well...

21:41.341 --> 21:42.592
why don't you come over

21:42.676 --> 21:45.554
and watch the game
and we'll have nachos

21:45.637 --> 21:47.597
and then, some beer.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.474
Oohh..

21:49.558 --> 21:50.976
Jerry, I think
you and I

21:51.059 --> 21:53.145
are going to
get along just...

21:53.228 --> 21:54.104
-D'oh!
-D'oh!
