00:31.490 --> 00:39.890
So tell us exactly what happened
well we went over to my room

00:39.890 --> 00:44.050
yes
and I took off my clothes

00:44.050 --> 00:47.410
ok
And then I took his clothes off

00:47.410 --> 00:54.199
go on
and then we did it

00:54.199 --> 00:55.590
how many times?

00:55.590 --> 01:02.880
I don't know, once maybe twice
he was doing okay

01:02.880 --> 01:07.050
then what happened
well then he told me he was broke and could

01:07.050 --> 01:11.870
I give him a break
what'd you do next?

01:11.870 --> 01:22.870
Well I went over to the closet
and I took out a sexual enhancement device

01:22.870 --> 01:25.600
And is this the device?

01:25.600 --> 01:29.960
Yeah that's it
then what did you do?

01:29.960 --> 01:31.960
I'll show ya

01:31.960 --> 04:08.290
(music)

04:08.290 --> 04:13.900
every time I look out my window it hits me
Los Angeles, the city of the angels

04:13.900 --> 04:19.600
I'd like to meet the sick son of a bitch that
thought that one up

04:19.600 --> 04:26.760
he must've had one wicked sense of humor
things had been relatively quiet until the

04:26.760 --> 04:30.590
middle of June
I say relatively as in relative to any giant

04:30.590 --> 04:32.940
sewer
that has 8 million rats scrurrying around

04:32.940 --> 04:36.680
looking for something to gnaw on
now that's the kind of quiet that makes L.A.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.900
the kind of place it is
Anyway

04:39.900 --> 04:43.430
Around mid-June someone must have turned over
a big rock

04:43.430 --> 04:47.569
because something weirder than the normal
weird began chewing up the local citizenry

04:47.569 --> 04:51.770
and spitting little pieces all over Glitter
City

04:51.770 --> 04:57.699
Where it started or exactly when I'm not sure
I don't think the cops even know

04:57.699 --> 05:02.310
but on a warm night, not long enough ago to
suit me, things were beginning to take shape

05:02.310 --> 05:08.949
somewhere on the other side of town
and it wasn't gonna be a pretty picture

05:08.949 --> 05:14.389
The West Side Bar
the kind of dark, quiet, sleazy place where

05:14.389 --> 05:18.180
dark, quiet, sleazy things happen on a regular
basis

05:18.180 --> 06:03.409
every now and then, someone dies

06:03.409 --> 06:05.160
you from around here?

06:05.160 --> 06:07.189
Yeah
where you from?

06:07.189 --> 06:13.759
Seattle
just down here for a few weeks on a job

06:13.759 --> 06:18.099
me too
what's your name, Seattle?

06:18.099 --> 06:19.099
Bo.

06:19.099 --> 06:25.360
Bo Hansen
Bo, Bo Hansen?

06:25.360 --> 06:27.840
What are you, a circus clown?

06:27.840 --> 06:32.039
Not Bobo, just Bo
my name, smart ass.

06:32.039 --> 06:33.620
Bo Hansen
well

06:33.620 --> 06:39.740
look who got up on the wrong side of the construction
site this morning

06:39.740 --> 06:43.009
what you need is some TFC to calm you down
TFC?

06:43.009 --> 06:53.400
What the hell is TFC?
It's Tender Fucking Care you big stiff

06:53.400 --> 06:58.379
you're a hooker, aren't you?

06:58.379 --> 07:01.729
Hey you moron
I'm a lady

07:01.729 --> 07:08.759
any jerk can see that
but I do, occasionally, provide services to

07:08.759 --> 07:14.969
release tension in our city's workforce
a social worker of sorts

07:14.969 --> 07:21.949
God knows you could use some social work
something got ya down, don't it baby?

07:21.949 --> 07:23.860
Yeah
but I don't wanna talk about it

07:23.860 --> 07:28.300
why don't you let Momma Mercedes buy you a
drink at her place

07:28.300 --> 07:31.370
it's cheaper there
I doubt that

07:31.370 --> 07:38.169
Oh come on, Bo
you could tell me how they sink those big

07:38.169 --> 07:45.210
girders in all that wet cement
Mercedes, huh?

07:45.210 --> 07:49.889
Man I bet you're as expensive as a fuckin
Mercedes Benz

07:49.889 --> 07:55.759
don't you worry about that
for big studs like you I can arrange financing

07:55.759 --> 07:58.539
what do ya say?

07:58.539 --> 08:28.770
Ah fuck it, come on let's go
this is your place?

08:28.770 --> 08:29.770
Yeah...

08:29.770 --> 08:34.650
Howard Hughes left it to me when he died
haven't seen anything like this since I left

08:34.650 --> 08:38.820
Okinawa
Ooh, a military man

08:38.820 --> 08:45.760
Drill Instructor
now we're talking

08:45.760 --> 09:05.399
have a seat
ya know, you construction workers really turn

09:05.399 --> 09:11.250
me on
must be the way we... pound nails

09:11.250 --> 09:22.300
I'll bet you pound a bucket-full a day
Sometimes

09:22.300 --> 09:26.110
you want some music?
It's your party

09:26.110 --> 09:51.130
it's OUR party
he really sends me

09:51.130 --> 10:12.579
yeah, nice
real nice

10:12.579 --> 11:00.910
this music does something to me
sometimes I get carried away

11:00.910 --> 11:13.700
want one?

11:13.700 --> 11:52.190
Oh, talk about stiff joints!
Oh yeah

11:52.190 --> 12:02.790
relax baby, relax
we don't want this to be over before we even

12:02.790 --> 12:03.790
get started, do we?

12:03.790 --> 12:06.720
I'm relaxin, I'm relaxin
I've got just the thing to loosen you up

12:06.720 --> 12:21.069
now close your eyes
and Mercedes will bring you a big surprise

12:21.069 --> 12:24.259
what are you doing?
Just keep those eyes closed

12:24.259 --> 12:28.020
and leave the driving to us, big boy
oh yeah

12:28.020 --> 12:34.000
oh yeah baby that's it
oh drag me to heaven

12:34.000 --> 12:46.110
take me to heaven
Your request is my demand!

12:46.110 --> 13:19.509
Oh no!
Oh nooooo!

13:19.509 --> 13:32.269
(screaming)
pieces started floating to the surface of

13:32.269 --> 13:36.850
the sewer around mid-June
cops immediately thought a serial killer was

13:36.850 --> 13:40.449
at large
well the M.O. was consistent, somebody liked

13:40.449 --> 13:45.089
a good chainsaw
but murder's not usually my racket

13:45.089 --> 13:50.290
my name's Jack Chandler
I find missing people, not pieces

13:50.290 --> 13:56.029
Once in a while, the two jobs overlap
I'd been hired to find a runaway teenage beauty

13:56.029 --> 13:59.259
from Oxnard
I was hired by the beauty's mother

13:59.259 --> 14:04.060
Seems the beauty's stepfather had been tucking
her into bed a little too tight and she decided

14:04.060 --> 14:08.350
to split to the big city
personally, I felt she couldn't be doing any

14:08.350 --> 14:13.730
worse than the deal she had at home
As usual, I was 100% wrong

14:13.730 --> 14:17.320
Harrison at metro had a freaked out girl that
matched that description of my runaway in

14:17.320 --> 14:21.639
custody
the charge: makin McNuggets with a chainsaw

14:21.639 --> 14:28.899
I don't give a good God damn
now you listen to me, put the gloves on, open

14:28.899 --> 14:32.300
the bag,
that's right, and count 'em again

14:32.300 --> 14:38.010
Jackson, you're the coroner, if your stomach
can't handle it, who's can?

14:38.010 --> 14:42.430
I don't care how many lunches you lose
I wanna know how many victims are in that

14:42.430 --> 14:46.600
bag and I wanna know soon or I'll find another
coroner!

14:46.600 --> 14:49.540
How's business, Mick?

14:49.540 --> 14:50.540
Chandler.

14:50.540 --> 14:54.439
Just what I need today, a private dick in
my face

14:54.439 --> 14:57.699
Come on Mick, let's have a little professional
courtesy, huh?

14:57.699 --> 15:00.420
After all, we're both on the same side of
the law

15:00.420 --> 15:03.579
Only because you haven't been caught, yet
now you don't wanna believe all those things

15:03.579 --> 15:05.980
you read in those dime novels, do ya?

15:05.980 --> 15:08.699
Some of us are honest
that's what this town's been needing for a

15:08.699 --> 15:14.769
long time, an honest dick
I'll tell ya, I'm about as honest as any man

15:14.769 --> 15:19.390
on the force
then you should be locked up

15:19.390 --> 15:23.500
what do you want, Jack?

15:23.500 --> 15:27.759
Looking for a girl
name's Samantha Kelso

15:27.759 --> 15:31.639
goes by Sam sometimes
I heard you had somebody down in lock up,

15:31.639 --> 15:34.060
looks just like her
thought I might get lucky

15:34.060 --> 15:38.189
you mean the nut with the chainsaw?
You get a name on her yet?

15:38.189 --> 15:40.740
Nah, the boys in interrogation screwed up
big time

15:40.740 --> 15:45.060
they thought the sight of the murder weapon
might shock her into spilling her guts

15:45.060 --> 15:47.569
only problem was they forgot to take the gas
out of it

15:47.569 --> 15:51.180
and she spilled their guts instead
she's a first class looney

15:51.180 --> 15:57.120
and we have no way of I.D.ing her so far
can I see her?

15:57.120 --> 16:04.360
What the hell... why not?
Have some men bring the Cuisinart queen in

16:04.360 --> 16:07.120
from lock up
thanks, Mick

16:07.120 --> 16:09.350
no problem.

16:09.350 --> 16:13.920
So, what's the story on this one?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.209
You know, typical runaway.

16:16.209 --> 16:20.209
Daddy bounces her on the wrong knee one too
many times, she goes searching for a new daddy

16:20.209 --> 16:23.470
town's full of 'em
yeah?

16:23.470 --> 16:24.650
Daddies or runaways?

16:24.650 --> 16:31.959
Both.
And I thought I was burned out

16:31.959 --> 16:37.269
bring her in
you can wait outside the door.

16:37.269 --> 16:40.050
Yes sir
sit down

16:40.050 --> 16:42.720
hello
Hi

16:42.720 --> 16:44.060
well?

16:44.060 --> 16:54.760
Close, but no cigar
what's your name, sweetheart?

16:54.760 --> 16:58.770
Lori, what's yours?

16:58.770 --> 17:00.110
Jack.

17:00.110 --> 17:01.389
You from around here Lori?

17:01.389 --> 17:03.640
Uh-huh
You ever been to Oxnard?

17:03.640 --> 17:11.770
No but I've been around the world a few times
you ever seen this girl?

17:11.770 --> 17:17.430
What's the matter, chainsaw got your tongue?
You guys are kinda cute

17:17.430 --> 17:22.349
both of ya
say, how'd you two boys like to take a little

17:22.349 --> 17:24.180
trip with Lori, huh?

17:24.180 --> 17:29.210
All you gotta do is pick my lock
forget it, psycho

17:29.210 --> 17:32.470
Officer Roberts, escort this freak back to
lock up

17:32.470 --> 17:38.700
Oooh talk tough to me daddy, it turns me on
get her outta here, now!

17:38.700 --> 17:43.530
Let's go
see ya later, boys

17:43.530 --> 17:49.539
don't bet on it
tough break, Chandler

17:49.539 --> 17:54.690
Nah, nah no sweat
I'd have been worried if it was really her,

17:54.690 --> 17:56.490
that woulda been too easy
yeah

17:56.490 --> 17:57.490
what?

17:57.490 --> 18:05.940
Sir, they just brought something in that you
might want to take a look at, it's down at

18:05.940 --> 18:09.710
the lab
Okay I'll head down that way

18:09.710 --> 18:11.049
Never ends.

18:11.049 --> 18:14.000
I'll walk with ya
yeah, ok

18:14.000 --> 18:26.380
set of keys, lip balm, mascara looks like,
and uh

18:26.380 --> 18:34.390
what do ya got?
The boys on the beat found this stuff on the

18:34.390 --> 18:36.850
sidewalk
dog was playing with it

18:36.850 --> 18:45.690
let's see it
this from uptown?

18:45.690 --> 18:50.500
No sir, they found it in West L.A.
get some prints off those and run 'em through

18:50.500 --> 18:51.770
the computer
yes sir

18:51.770 --> 18:56.230
let me know when you find the rest of 'em
sir! There's something else in here, stuck

18:56.230 --> 18:57.799
to the bottom
what is it?

18:57.799 --> 18:59.490
A matchbook
no shit!

18:59.490 --> 19:01.510
Could it be a clue?

19:01.510 --> 19:12.160
Everything's a clue, son
well, uh, see you around guys

19:12.160 --> 19:20.470
hey Harrison, wait for me
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake

19:20.470 --> 19:24.200
that girl Lori off my mind
her face, her voice

19:24.200 --> 19:28.179
the way she looked at us
it all kept bugging me, but it wasn't getting

19:28.179 --> 19:34.740
me any closer to finding Samantha Kelso
neither was coming here, but it made me feel

19:34.740 --> 19:38.909
better
this is where Sally lives, Sally's my girl,

19:38.909 --> 19:42.490
sort of
deep down I felt there was some connection

19:42.490 --> 19:46.020
between that chainsaw-happy chick and my missing
girl

19:46.020 --> 19:49.250
I saw the look in her eyes when she saw Samantha's
picture

19:49.250 --> 19:53.490
she knew her from somewhere
and the cops had come up with another victim,

19:53.490 --> 19:57.050
or at least part of him
maybe there was another killer out there

19:57.050 --> 20:29.970
just maybe
Something told me to pinch the matches when

20:29.970 --> 20:34.080
I first saw them
someone had scrawled a number inside the matches

20:34.080 --> 20:38.970
and a name, Mercedes
had the guy been trying to buy a car and wound

20:38.970 --> 20:47.000
up in a used parts department himself?

20:47.000 --> 20:50.160
Sally was out like a light
but the night was still young so I decided

20:50.160 --> 20:54.250
to get back to work
being a dick is a 24-hour a day job

20:54.250 --> 20:58.450
where the fuck do you think you're going now?

20:58.450 --> 21:03.020
Sally woke up and had that longing look in
her eye

21:03.020 --> 21:06.480
begged me not to leave, but I told her I had
a dangerous job I had to go on

21:06.480 --> 21:12.649
and she understood, she wished me well, threw
me a kiss

21:12.649 --> 21:19.870
what can I tell ya, the kid just loved me
I told her I'd be real careful and I'd come

21:19.870 --> 21:24.640
back as soon as I could
tears welled up in her eyes as I walked out

21:24.640 --> 22:02.140
the door
meanwhile, across town

22:02.140 --> 22:30.279
are you Lisa?

22:30.279 --> 22:36.309
Yeah
you Hermie Beamer?

22:36.309 --> 22:40.120
Just call me Herman
yeah, alright

22:40.120 --> 22:51.909
okay Hermie, what do you got to drink around
here?

22:51.909 --> 22:54.920
Is sour mash alright?
It'll do

22:54.920 --> 23:07.730
for a start
what's in the suitcase?

23:07.730 --> 23:22.370
24 inches of fun
I beg your pardon?

23:22.370 --> 23:29.039
Toys, for big boys
oh

23:29.039 --> 23:34.880
so tell me Hermie, what's on your beady little
mind?

23:34.880 --> 23:45.570
Well, I um, would like to take some pictures
nude

23:45.570 --> 23:50.640
that's doable
it's not for me, for my business

23:50.640 --> 23:58.500
Hermie, you're not going to sell naked pictures
of me on the street...

23:58.500 --> 23:59.500
no!

23:59.500 --> 24:08.399
I wouldn't do that
this is for a calendar, advertising my product

24:08.399 --> 24:15.039
and what exactly is it that you sell?

24:15.039 --> 24:19.159
Baseball bats
nude calendars for baseball bats...

24:19.159 --> 24:24.690
all the little leaguers just love 'em
church groups do, too

24:24.690 --> 24:37.840
ok Hermie, it's your ballgame
let's see if you can go the whole 9 innings

24:37.840 --> 24:51.539
hold it, hold it
oh great!

24:51.539 --> 25:17.490
Oh great, bring back... oh
hold it

25:17.490 --> 25:37.390
oh yes, that's perfect
just hold that

25:37.390 --> 25:59.710
perfect
oh that's really good

25:59.710 --> 26:14.130
why are you coming so close?

26:14.130 --> 26:16.890
I can't keep it in focus
why are you coming so close?

26:16.890 --> 26:42.769
I can't do it if you come this close!
Well Hermie, it looks like your calendar idea

26:42.769 --> 27:16.280
was ahead of it's time
while Herman's evening may have been... cut

27:16.280 --> 27:20.940
short... mine was just getting started
I came back to my office to dial the number

27:20.940 --> 27:24.880
on the matchbook
it rang a long time, something deep inside

27:24.880 --> 27:28.340
me hoped there'd be no answer
no such luck.

27:28.340 --> 27:33.179
A woman picked up the phone
she said she was selling, but not a car

27:33.179 --> 27:37.600
Mercedes was her name
low miles, built for comfort not speed

27:37.600 --> 27:41.049
I played it cool and agreed to meet her at
the West Side for a drink

27:41.049 --> 27:45.950
after I hung up I began to wonder if the finger
prints on the matchbook would turn out to

27:45.950 --> 27:49.500
be hers
another death by dismemberment in the news

27:49.500 --> 27:52.889
tonight, this brings the total up to 5 over
the last 2 weeks

27:52.889 --> 27:56.679
Detective Harrison of the metro division made
a statement this afternoon attributing the

27:56.679 --> 28:00.450
most recent death to an accident
the guy was just cleaning his chainsaw when

28:00.450 --> 28:03.950
it went off
yeah sure, maybe it was a suicide

28:03.950 --> 28:08.620
I didn't believe Harrison's theory any more
than the d.j. did, but I understood it

28:08.620 --> 28:12.910
I knew what the police statement was all about
it was just a little fairy tale to help the

28:12.910 --> 28:16.789
kids sleep at night
at the time I was a lot more concerned about

28:16.789 --> 28:21.899
meeting this mysterious dame alone than what
the radio had to say about the chainsaw killer

28:21.899 --> 28:25.919
if I was on the trail of one of these psychos,
I wanted to make sure I didn't end up in a

28:25.919 --> 28:29.230
paper bag
like the last guy who lit these matches

28:29.230 --> 28:35.520
who knows, maybe I'd get lucky and the dame
could lead me to Samantha Kelso and I could

28:35.520 --> 28:39.309
wrap up the case
nice and clean and pay last month's rent

28:39.309 --> 28:42.000
little Jack lucky
that's what they called me

28:42.000 --> 28:54.350
yeah... sure...
it didn't look like my date had arrived yet,

28:54.350 --> 28:58.940
I wasn't quite sure who I was looking for
all Mercedes said was that her headlights

28:58.940 --> 29:02.730
were great
I decided to get a drink and bug the bar hop

29:02.730 --> 29:17.840
a little
What'll it be, pal?

29:17.840 --> 29:43.840
Bourbon, with a bourbon chaser
think I'll have to write that down

29:43.840 --> 29:48.210
I decided to flash the missing girl's picture
around while I waited

29:48.210 --> 29:53.450
first I showed him Samantha Kelso's photo
then I showed him a picture of a chainsaw

29:53.450 --> 29:58.690
I'd torn out of a magazine at Sally's place
still nothing

29:58.690 --> 30:03.779
then I showed him how to make a shadow bunny
on the wall

30:03.779 --> 30:08.740
nothing phased this guy
I hope you haven't been waiting long

30:08.740 --> 30:18.279
no I... just got here
you're uh...

30:18.279 --> 30:24.929
Mercedes
oh, how'd you pick me out?

30:24.929 --> 30:32.600
You're the only man in here
buy you a drink?

30:32.600 --> 30:52.510
Yeah, first let's get a table
okay

30:52.510 --> 31:06.840
So, tell me, uh...

31:06.840 --> 31:10.380
Jack
Jack, so tell me Jack

31:10.380 --> 31:18.669
how did you come by my number?
An acquaintance of mine passed it on to me

31:18.669 --> 31:23.580
yeah, he said that he was very very happy
with the

31:23.580 --> 31:31.480
headlights and upholstery
Jack?

31:31.480 --> 31:36.159
Yeah
I'm going to fuck your brains out

31:36.159 --> 31:41.179
I didn't like the sound of that
Well I'll get the drinks

31:41.179 --> 31:44.950
oh, don't bother
this one's on me

31:44.950 --> 31:54.501
besides, I know the bartender personally
he might get mad if I don't come by to say

31:54.501 --> 31:59.320
hello
oh yeah, he's a real social kind of guy

31:59.320 --> 32:02.179
Mercedes certainly seemed to have her engine
racing

32:02.179 --> 32:06.240
but that didn't make her guilty of murder,
if that was the case the whole town would

32:06.240 --> 32:10.370
be in trouble
of course that didn't rule her out, either

32:10.370 --> 32:13.130
I looked over at the little number on the
stage

32:13.130 --> 32:23.820
she was shaking it pretty good, even if no
one was watching

32:23.820 --> 32:27.299
you could've knocked me over with a pubic
hair

32:27.299 --> 32:32.970
there she was, Samantha Kelso
humping it out on that little stage for anyone

32:32.970 --> 32:39.500
who could stick a buck down her pants
maybe my luck had started to change

32:39.500 --> 32:44.080
I checked the photo to make sure
it was her all right.

32:44.080 --> 32:48.840
A little slinkier and a little more seasoned
than when the picture was taken, but then

32:48.840 --> 32:54.510
city life will do that to a dish like her
warning bells started going off in my head

32:54.510 --> 32:59.929
so I decided to put in a call to Harrison
if there were going to be fireworks, I wanted

32:59.929 --> 33:02.740
to make sure my friends in blue were invited
to the party

33:02.740 --> 33:03.740
Hello Metro?

33:03.740 --> 33:05.880
You have reached the metropolitan police homicide
division.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.460
All operators are currently busy.

33:07.460 --> 33:08.460
Please hold.

33:08.460 --> 33:11.550
Your call will be answered in the order it
was received.

33:11.550 --> 33:14.049
If you have committed a recent homicide, please
stay on the line.

33:14.049 --> 33:15.049
We want very much to hear from you.

33:15.049 --> 33:25.409
If you are currently in fear of becoming a
homicide in the next few minutes, you may

33:25.409 --> 33:37.850
want to hang up and dial 911 for immediate
service

33:37.850 --> 33:44.070
Thank you
Damn answering machines!

33:44.070 --> 33:47.659
I didn't have time to wait for the metro boys
to get around to my call

33:47.659 --> 33:53.779
my date was back
I'm sorry, I had to go wash up it's kind of

33:53.779 --> 33:57.841
a rough day
well, let's hope that your evening goes a

33:57.841 --> 34:03.929
little smoother
yeah, let's hope

34:03.929 --> 34:09.550
are you looking for someone, Jack?

34:09.550 --> 34:12.159
Hmm?
It's not nice to make your date jealous

34:12.159 --> 34:15.460
oh I'm sorry, just this habit I have.

34:15.460 --> 34:22.469
I'm sort of a people watcher
well, I like to participate more than spectate

34:22.469 --> 34:30.199
well, different strokes for different folks,
that's what makes a superbowl

34:30.199 --> 34:37.750
what's that you're driking, anyway?
It's a Screaming Orgasm

34:37.750 --> 34:40.679
somehow I knew it would be...

34:40.679 --> 34:54.339
I just love intelligent men
yeah, I'm kind of an... noticing that you're

34:54.339 --> 34:56.469
kind of... you're...

34:56.469 --> 35:04.390
I'm a real scream once you get to know me
Oh yeah, little Jack lucky, that's what they

35:04.390 --> 35:07.720
should call me alright
I've got more luck than anyone should have

35:07.720 --> 35:12.000
a right to
unfortunately, it's all bad

35:12.000 --> 35:17.780
oh well, I guess I should've been looking
at the glass instead of the ass, that'll teach

35:17.780 --> 35:22.440
me
Yeah, sure it will

35:22.440 --> 35:26.760
if my head wasn't hurting so much I'd have
sworn I was in heaven

35:26.760 --> 35:32.359
heaven for guys who liked big tits
but my head was hurting, and I wasn't in heaven

35:32.359 --> 35:39.869
I wasn't even close
don't say a thing

35:39.869 --> 35:43.910
lie back, be still
you've been through a terrible ordeal

35:43.910 --> 35:47.839
what happened?
On my way home tonight I found you in the

35:47.839 --> 35:49.790
gutter
I thought you were dead

35:49.790 --> 35:53.240
well I guess I'm lucky you bumped over me,
huh?

35:53.240 --> 35:55.700
Lot of people wouldn't have had the nerve
to do that

35:55.700 --> 36:01.569
I'm so glad you didn't die on me
that would've been awful

36:01.569 --> 36:05.170
yeah... where am I exactly anyway?
In my apartment

36:05.170 --> 36:07.859
do you remember what happened?

36:07.859 --> 36:15.660
I was in a bar with a beautiful girl having
a drink, and all of a sudden lights out

36:15.660 --> 36:19.349
is that it?
That's all I remember.

36:19.349 --> 36:29.260
Sorry it's not a very exciting story
well, I was looking through your wallet for

36:29.260 --> 36:30.260
a little identification
you're a detective

36:30.260 --> 36:35.690
private eye, I trace missing persons mostly
that must be very exciting

36:35.690 --> 36:41.450
oh yeah, it's a barrel of laughs
I thought you might be chasing after some

36:41.450 --> 36:46.240
murderers or kidnappers or something
no nothing that spectacular, just a teenage

36:46.240 --> 36:49.350
runaway
somewhere along the line I must've slipped

36:49.350 --> 36:51.180
on a piece of shit and landed in here with
you

36:51.180 --> 36:56.550
why don't you call the police?

36:56.550 --> 37:04.339
Well I tried, couldn't get through
oh I'm so glad Jack

37:04.339 --> 37:09.060
because I have you all to myself now
for a moment there I thought I was paralyzed,

37:09.060 --> 37:16.290
then I noticed, my hands and feet were tied
sister, what's with the bondage routine here

37:16.290 --> 37:23.550
I just didn't want you running away before
I could get to know you better

37:23.550 --> 37:27.400
well that was it
I'd been played for a 14 karat gold plated

37:27.400 --> 37:31.349
goof one more time
if there was an award for suckers given out

37:31.349 --> 37:41.970
annually I'd have to buy a bigger mantle piece
now girls, girls, ordinarily this would be

37:41.970 --> 37:46.360
a real picnic for me
but see, I've been seeing this other lady

37:46.360 --> 37:50.410
recently
we're sort of going steady you know, so somehow

37:50.410 --> 37:59.150
I don't feel right about this
how dare you act like a pack of wild animals

37:59.150 --> 38:00.970
in my presence
we didn't hear you come in

38:00.970 --> 38:03.990
we were just preparing him
no kidding.

38:03.990 --> 38:10.270
Get out
till I call for you

38:10.270 --> 38:19.040
Well I'm sure lucky you showed up when you
did

38:19.040 --> 38:31.550
don't be so sure
Ilsa

38:31.550 --> 38:40.090
now now honey not in front of the guest
you don't have to do that, I took a bath only

38:40.090 --> 38:44.610
yesterday
whoa!

38:44.610 --> 38:54.520
We're very honored to have you here, Mr. Chandler
cut it out, cut it out

38:54.520 --> 38:56.810
let me rephrase that...
ahhh!

38:56.810 --> 39:14.349
Please Mr. Chandler, think of the neighbors
they're trying to sleep

39:14.349 --> 39:27.240
very good work Ilsa
there, I think that's clean enough

39:27.240 --> 39:35.089
you see, you've stumbled on us at a very bad
time Jack

39:35.089 --> 39:41.640
bad for you, that is
better?

39:41.640 --> 39:46.550
That's the biggest bra I ever tasted
you're an amusing fellow

39:46.550 --> 39:50.970
it's a shame we won't have more time to chat
oh yeah?

39:50.970 --> 39:53.950
I got plenty of time, I don't have another
appointment till noon tomorrow

39:53.950 --> 39:58.460
I'm afraid you'll have to cancel that, you'll
be otherwise engaged at that time

39:58.460 --> 40:05.260
I suppose you are wondering what's going on
huh, no, seems typical to me

40:05.260 --> 40:10.180
but I will admit that the sight of that chainsaw
on the nightstand has my curiosity piqued

40:10.180 --> 40:17.540
it's a very important part of our religion
oh.. sort of a means to an end, so to speak

40:17.540 --> 40:21.430
much more than that
it is the cosmic link by which all things

40:21.430 --> 40:22.960
are united
oh really?

40:22.960 --> 40:26.640
See I would've thought it was the other way
around

40:26.640 --> 40:29.940
doesn't seem like you kids have been doing
much uniting of anything around here lately

40:29.940 --> 40:31.850
Just what is it you think we have been doing?

40:31.850 --> 40:37.700
The way I see it, you guys have got this black
market body part transplant business

40:37.700 --> 40:41.510
where you take the arms and legs of young
studs and you give 'em to rich old fucks who

40:41.510 --> 40:44.960
can't hack it anymore
you know, sort of a love "em and cleave 'em"

40:44.960 --> 40:48.330
racket
with a little quality control department on

40:48.330 --> 40:51.430
the side
the girls?

40:51.430 --> 40:55.500
Yeah yeah these high powered vacuum pumps
with tits

40:55.500 --> 40:58.849
an imaginative theory, but you're way off
the mark

40:58.849 --> 41:04.250
these women are actually my minions, my disciples
oh yeah?

41:04.250 --> 41:07.710
What are you, the high priest kind of character
or somethin?

41:07.710 --> 41:10.569
What is this, some ancient chainsaw worshiping
cult?

41:10.569 --> 41:12.819
Actually, that"s just what it is
oh yeah?

41:12.819 --> 41:16.300
What do you do, pray to Black & Decker?

41:16.300 --> 41:18.560
Our religion has it's roots in the Egypt of
my ancestors

41:18.560 --> 41:24.880
come on, they didn't have chainsaws back then
but there were the chainsaws of the gods

41:24.880 --> 41:29.619
there are many things that modern man has
failed to understand

41:29.619 --> 41:35.380
our cult needs sacrifices, human sacrifices,
frequently

41:35.380 --> 41:40.470
the blade of the saw purifies the evil flesh
and makes it holy

41:40.470 --> 41:44.880
to please our god
and this is that big night for you huh?

41:44.880 --> 41:50.490
That really special sacrifice when you get
the chance to live for another hundred years

41:50.490 --> 41:51.490
or so, right?

41:51.490 --> 41:52.559
How do you know this?

41:52.559 --> 41:57.070
I read about it in the Enquirer
so what are you gonna do now?

41:57.070 --> 41:58.970
You gonna hack us up right here?

41:58.970 --> 42:00.569
Nothing so archaic Mr. Chandler.

42:00.569 --> 42:07.270
We're gonna take you to our temple downtown
Makes for a much nicer ceremony

42:07.270 --> 42:11.480
Well a lot can happen between here and Chop
City, big fella

42:11.480 --> 42:15.750
perhaps you're right, better cut him up now
No wait!

42:15.750 --> 42:16.750
Buddy!

42:16.750 --> 42:18.980
It was just a joke.

42:18.980 --> 42:22.869
I really wouldn't do that, actually I'd probably
enjoy being in the ceremony you know?

42:22.869 --> 42:25.059
Come to think of it, I haven't been to church
in weeks

42:25.059 --> 42:28.460
maybe I'd learn something
little late for that

42:28.460 --> 42:32.000
we can't trust you to behave yourself
you're making a big mistake here now

42:32.000 --> 42:35.710
I bet your god would get off on a heathen
soul like mine

42:35.710 --> 42:40.400
don't you worry about that
This isn't an official ceremony, he will know

42:40.400 --> 42:55.410
what are we supposed to do?
All right!

42:55.410 --> 42:58.820
Let's get to it!

42:58.820 --> 43:04.590
Don't we get to (moaning) first?

43:04.590 --> 43:12.480
Nah, it's almost time for Letterman
hey wait a minute...

43:12.480 --> 43:19.450
hey I thought you said you were going to fuck
my brains out

43:19.450 --> 43:24.180
oh I was!
But this is much faster!

43:24.180 --> 43:25.180
Hey kid!

43:25.180 --> 43:27.080
How about helping me out, huh?

43:27.080 --> 43:33.010
You're the reason I got into this mess
all I was trying to do was deliver a message

43:33.010 --> 43:34.630
from your mother
I wasn't planning on turning into a deli platter

43:34.630 --> 43:35.630
is this absolutely necessary?

43:35.630 --> 44:03.470
I mean don't they have hors d'oeuvres back
at the temple?

44:03.470 --> 44:05.320
Time to say goodnight!
Damn!

44:05.320 --> 44:07.540
We're out of gas
you idiot!

44:07.540 --> 44:15.890
I told you to stop at Texaco on the way here
well, come on there's a mini mart right down

44:15.890 --> 44:20.430
the street
ok

44:20.430 --> 44:28.950
Samantha, you stay here and watch this guy
ok

44:28.950 --> 44:34.160
hey pick me up a slushie while you're at it,
will ya?

44:34.160 --> 44:41.589
Cherry, if they've got it
you're not gonna let 'em use that oversize

44:41.589 --> 44:42.589
veg-o-matic on me, are ya?

44:42.589 --> 44:47.550
Untie me and I'll take you home to mom
I don't want to go home

44:47.550 --> 44:51.220
it's ok, she kicked out your stepfather, he's
not gonna bother you anymore

44:51.220 --> 44:56.599
mom kicked Mike out of the house?
You seem upset, I thought that'd be good news

44:56.599 --> 45:01.960
no, I kinda liked Mike
I thought he was the reason that you...

45:01.960 --> 45:12.109
Shhh!
We can't talk

45:12.109 --> 45:15.230
now
listen up, those sickos killed a friend of

45:15.230 --> 45:20.230
mine up in Oxnard
she told me all about them before she disappeared

45:20.230 --> 45:24.420
she was hanging out with them and everything
was nice and innocent

45:24.420 --> 45:29.349
just some religious freakiness
but then they found her head in a garbage

45:29.349 --> 45:32.170
can
and I knew what had happened so I followed

45:32.170 --> 45:37.180
this freak and his whores down to L.A.
to infiltrate their group so I could get revenge

45:37.180 --> 45:41.440
on these fuckers
I didn't want my mom to know what I was doing

45:41.440 --> 45:46.869
I figured she'd try to ground me or something
but I didn't know she'd blame it on Mike

45:46.869 --> 45:49.500
I didn't think you had time to talk!
We don't, we don't have time to talk but

45:49.500 --> 46:00.670
not if you wanna save your scalp
ok kid, you're the boss

46:00.670 --> 46:03.260
what's next?
You get the hell out of here

46:03.260 --> 46:09.210
I'm not leaving you now
I can't go with you, they're taking me to

46:09.210 --> 46:14.059
the temple tonight to be the prime sacrifice
somehow I don't think mom would like that

46:14.059 --> 46:18.280
too much
I have no intentions of being chopped up,

46:18.280 --> 46:22.300
I'm gonna burn that temple over those fuckers'
heads

46:22.300 --> 46:27.990
you got a lot of guts for a little girl
great dancer, too

46:27.990 --> 46:31.069
thanks!
The only thing is, you're not thinking clearly

46:31.069 --> 46:35.170
see, cause the minute those chainsaw chicks
get back and see that you let me go

46:35.170 --> 46:37.280
they're gonna start hacking into you real
good

46:37.280 --> 46:42.640
I can take care of myself
listen sister, your mother paid me to come

46:42.640 --> 46:48.720
and get you and bring you back in one piece
and I'm not leaving here without you

46:48.720 --> 47:00.770
you talk pretty tough when you're untied
don't make me use force, kid

47:00.770 --> 47:17.030
I said I'm staying!
It took a while, but I finally found my car

47:17.030 --> 47:20.760
stashed on the side of the motel
keys in it and everything

47:20.760 --> 47:25.119
guess I'm lucky it wasn't stolen
well I'd found Samantha Kelso

47:25.119 --> 47:30.430
but she'd led me to something even bigger
I'd stumbled into the middle of an evil, insidious

47:30.430 --> 47:35.309
cult of chainsaw worshiping maniacs
I had to wonder if we'd let our religious

47:35.309 --> 47:39.510
freedom go too far in this country
or maybe our immigration laws were just too

47:39.510 --> 47:43.559
lax
I've never been much for politics, but I kept

47:43.559 --> 47:46.530
thinking about that pretty girl's warm head
on my lap and

47:46.530 --> 47:50.530
then I wondered how many other pretty girls
would never be able to put their heads

47:50.530 --> 47:56.250
on my lap because they'd been cut off by that
refugee from the BTL club and his slice-happy

47:56.250 --> 47:59.089
sluts
I started to get mad

47:59.089 --> 48:02.089
my first instinct was to go straight to the
cops

48:02.089 --> 48:05.970
but that was all the way across town, and
there was no guarantee they were gonna believe

48:05.970 --> 48:10.109
me
So I decided to stop by my office and pick

48:10.109 --> 48:15.730
up some supplies
I decided to call Harrison at home even though

48:15.730 --> 48:20.060
he made me promise never to do that
I just didn't feel like listening to the homo

48:20.060 --> 48:27.359
squad's answering machine again
You've reached the home of homicide detective

48:27.359 --> 48:31.690
Mick Harrison, I'm not here at the moment
but you might be able to reach me at the metro

48:31.690 --> 48:36.040
homicide division
if you care to leave a message, wait for the

48:36.040 --> 48:38.680
beep
unless you're Jack Chandler, in which case

48:38.680 --> 48:42.950
you can hang up Jack
I told you a hundred times not to call me

48:42.950 --> 48:43.950
at home!

48:43.950 --> 48:46.750
Yeah Harrison this is Jack Chandler, I know
I'm not supposed to call you at home

48:46.750 --> 48:50.910
but this is really, really important
I just found out your chainsaw killer is not

48:50.910 --> 48:53.049
working alone
there's a whole pack of 'em and they're being

48:53.049 --> 48:58.630
led by some crazed chainsaw worshiping priest
I'll fill you in on the details later, alright?

48:58.630 --> 49:01.420
Look, meanwhile get down to the Purdone lane
area

49:01.420 --> 49:07.079
they've got some kind of warehouse there they've
turned into a sacrificial temple

49:07.079 --> 49:09.869
they're gonna have a big party tonight and
we're all invited

49:09.869 --> 49:19.920
Oh and Mick, bring your own beer
oh god, what happened?

49:19.920 --> 49:24.250
Where are we?
We're in my office

49:24.250 --> 49:26.940
pretty neat place, huh?

49:26.940 --> 49:30.160
Yeah...
god the sacrifice will begin soon, we gotta

49:30.160 --> 49:32.290
get to the temple
no no, just stay right here.

49:32.290 --> 49:38.559
You're in no condition to go anywhere
I feel like I've been hit with a brick

49:38.559 --> 49:46.089
Yeah sorry I had to cold cock you like that
that's okay, you did what you had to do

49:46.089 --> 50:00.839
you know maybe you could make up for it...
wait wait

50:00.839 --> 50:05.810
wait a minute.. ohhh
how old are you kid?

50:06.910 --> 50:10.210
You got any proof of I.D.?

50:10.210 --> 50:20.809
I left it at home
private dick, huh?

50:20.809 --> 50:23.369
I shoulda known better, there's no such thing
in Hollywood

50:23.369 --> 50:26.980
who was that?

50:26.980 --> 50:32.500
Well that was Sally
She was my girl, sort of

50:32.500 --> 50:34.480
Sorry
it's alright

50:34.480 --> 50:51.440
You mean to tell me your mother had no idea
why you left?

50:51.440 --> 50:57.920
I guess not
well, I told you I liked Mike, and I didn't

50:57.920 --> 51:03.559
mind the fact that he liked me back
except for my mom, I felt kinda bad for her

51:03.559 --> 51:05.160
of course
Oh yeah, of course

51:05.160 --> 51:10.480
but it was really a bitch that she got the
wrong idea and kicked Mike out

51:10.480 --> 51:12.819
well from where I'm sitting, I think Mike
could've used some kicking

51:12.819 --> 51:17.819
yeah I think you're right
it was crummy the way he treated her

51:17.819 --> 51:22.190
he should've respected her
oh yeah, like you did

51:22.190 --> 51:23.190
what?

51:23.190 --> 51:26.619
C'mon, you're a swell kid, you oughtta be
skipping rope in some school yard right now

51:26.619 --> 51:30.480
instead of on this wild goose chase
this is dangerous you know

51:30.480 --> 51:31.480
are you afraid?

51:31.480 --> 51:32.480
Afraid?

51:32.480 --> 51:33.480
Ha.

51:33.480 --> 51:38.880
Let me tell you something sister I've been
shot, almost, 5 times

51:38.880 --> 51:43.800
I didn't tell you how they found my friend
in that trash can, did I?

51:43.800 --> 51:51.430
In fact a couple times I was almost stabbed
besides being chainsawed, five times

51:51.430 --> 51:56.859
they had taken skin and torn it along her
jaws

51:56.859 --> 52:00.490
taken her eyes and gouged them till they hit
her chin

52:00.490 --> 52:05.569
all the skin on her mouth was cut and looked
like she was laughing

52:05.569 --> 52:08.400
but she really wasn't
shut up, will ya!

52:08.400 --> 52:11.329
Don't you wanna hear the worst part?

52:11.329 --> 52:15.750
No!
That kid talked like a frosted flake

52:15.750 --> 52:27.390
but she had the nicest set of knockers that
I'd seen in a long time

52:27.390 --> 52:29.309
don't you have any idea what this place looks
like?

52:29.309 --> 52:30.940
They never told me.

52:30.940 --> 52:36.490
I don't know, I think it has something to
do with importing and exporting

52:36.490 --> 52:42.660
Oh yeah, the old in out routine
Jeez, you wish they'd have some kind of a

52:42.660 --> 52:46.600
sign
Look, there!

52:46.600 --> 52:53.180
This could be it...
wow!

52:53.180 --> 53:03.930
Listen, you sure you want to get involved
in this?

53:03.930 --> 53:06.900
You wouldn't believe the things I've done
to get this far

53:06.900 --> 53:31.990
C'mon, let's check this place out, quietly
gotcha

53:31.990 --> 53:35.770
Gotta be some good way into this place, we
just gotta keep looking

53:35.770 --> 53:39.250
I am right behind you
Jack?

53:39.250 --> 53:41.380
Yeah?

53:41.380 --> 53:47.450
I'm scared
listen kid, this is no time to start thinking

53:47.450 --> 53:50.640
about some 3-foot long chainsaw slicing up
your midsection

53:50.640 --> 53:59.049
besides, I got a gun right here and they don't
even know we're here

53:59.049 --> 54:05.809
nobody heard that
alright, one lousy guy

54:05.809 --> 54:19.540
things aren't working out exactly the way
I planned

54:19.540 --> 54:23.810
at least we're together
yeah, let's hope we can keep it that way

54:23.810 --> 54:34.319
shut up!

54:34.319 --> 54:43.130
I am so sorry I got you involved in this
you know, you're kinda cute

54:43.130 --> 54:45.951
even though you do talk funny
thanks

54:45.951 --> 54:50.040
I think
yeah you're kinda cute too

54:50.040 --> 54:56.829
especially those beautiful...
ah thanks...

54:56.829 --> 55:02.390
girls!
How's it hanging?

55:02.390 --> 55:07.900
We'll find out... soon enough
have you ever considered therapy?

55:07.900 --> 55:13.430
I'm going to enjoy splattering you
Hostile, very hostile

55:13.430 --> 55:15.600
but a great set of...
Yeah, I know

55:15.600 --> 55:22.970
Samantha, how you disappointed the Master
fuck off, slut

55:22.970 --> 55:28.309
now your true nature is revealed
my how you deceived us

55:28.309 --> 55:33.809
you killed a good friend of mine, Jenny Lynn,
remember?

55:33.809 --> 55:35.500
Jenny Lynn?

55:35.500 --> 55:44.270
Jenny Lynn!
Oh yes, she was a snooty little bitch just

55:44.270 --> 55:48.400
like you
and we had fun with her

55:48.400 --> 55:54.470
you're gonna pay for what you did!

55:54.470 --> 56:02.990
Sweet...
what's that?

56:02.990 --> 56:10.250
You've been very naughty, Samantha, but our
Master's going to give you one more chance

56:10.250 --> 56:14.299
to redeem yourself
She's not a book of stamps!

56:14.299 --> 56:30.150
Shut your face, heathen.
She will redeem herself, to eternity

56:30.150 --> 56:31.390
oh come on!

56:31.390 --> 56:34.760
I'm sure you've been stuck by worse than that
tonight

56:34.760 --> 56:39.380
and I hope you enjoyed your little piece because
it will be your last

56:39.380 --> 56:44.250
and now it's your turn to be a piece, or should
I say, pieces

56:44.250 --> 56:51.480
well I guess it all depends on the context
Hey Sam you alright?

56:51.480 --> 56:56.140
What was in that needle?
The blood of our ancestors

56:56.140 --> 56:59.230
what are you doing, where are you taking her?

56:59.230 --> 57:05.670
Don't worry, you'll be together again soon
you're going to be our special guest tonight

57:05.670 --> 57:27.280
yeah, and our human sacrifice
terrific

57:27.280 --> 57:32.160
so good of you to drop by Mr. Chandler
you saved us the unpleasant task of having

57:32.160 --> 57:35.079
to go get you
Well I'm glad I could be of some help

57:35.079 --> 57:38.059
you're going to make an excellent offering
to our gods

57:38.059 --> 57:41.820
you know Ive been doing a lot of thinking
about that lately, I've come to the conclusion

57:41.820 --> 57:47.270
that this building isn't zoned for human sacrifices
you guys could get in a whole lot of trouble

57:47.270 --> 57:53.250
for doing this
I think it's time somebody cut you down to

57:53.250 --> 57:59.099
size, Jack.

57:59.099 --> 58:10.430
Oh Horace, great god of the heavens, look
down upon us, your faithful servants

58:10.430 --> 58:18.070
unworthy in your eyes, let us praise your
greatness this night, with our feast of the

58:18.070 --> 58:24.030
dead
accept our humble offering, that we might

58:24.030 --> 58:28.750
live on to serve and praise you for years
to come

58:28.750 --> 59:59.210
come forward, high priestess of Anubis
come forth and serve thy master

59:59.210 --> 01:00:13.421
go forth, go to the faithful they may taste
the blood of Anubis

01:00:13.421 --> 01:02:31.109
the blood is the life
Tonight, oh Horace, we offer you a new disciple

01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:36.730
a fresh, untouched flower to adorn the crown
of the gods

01:02:36.730 --> 01:05:00.920
we, your humble slaves, offer you the virgin
dance of the double chainsaws

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:12.400
Prepare to meet Anubis
yeah well I'll just scurry on home and slip

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.020
into my tux
C'mon, step on it!

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:26.660
I am Chief, I am!
Can't you go any faster?

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:37.500
You know Cheif, this is last year's model
got bald tires, needs a tune-up

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.500
god damn it, it would've been faster with
my Volkswagen

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:47.720
next time take your damn Volkswagen
You know, when I was a kid I used to have

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:53.650
the same problem with my old man's lawnmower
he used to get the same expression on his

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:56.040
face
oh shut up!

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.280
Hey, what's with Sam?

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:03.900
She looks kinda distant
ah, she's one with the gods

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:07.099
yeah well that and a quart of oil will start
your buzz saw

01:06:07.099 --> 01:06:24.839
in your hands you hold the chainsaw of the
gods

01:06:24.839 --> 01:06:33.720
use it wisely
kill him!

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.260
Kill him!

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:55.330
Now Sam, you're not still sore about that
headbutt are ya?

01:06:55.330 --> 01:08:02.480
C'mon have a heart!
Way to go!

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:15.830
Talk about cutting it close!
For a minute there I thought you were gonna

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:21.290
turn me into chop suey
Well I should have!

01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:26.170
Maybe my luck's changed at last
this must be the place

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:38.950
I think you're right chief
go round them up, I'm gonna go look for Jack

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:43.450
Chandler
and you boys behave yourselves

01:08:43.450 --> 01:09:05.990
alright, let's catch as many as we can!
Damn Chandler, what the hell happened?

01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:14.460
Glad you could make it, you're a little late
what took you so long?

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.270
Letterman was on, he had some pretty damn
good guests

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:19.520
how many times have I told ya, buy a VCR!

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.040
You can tape those things
crime rate in this town would probably go

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.560
down 10%
then they'd lay me off

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.300
how'd you find us?

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.450
Boys had their eye on this bunch for a long
time now

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:31.410
we thought they were just smuggling illegal
artifacts

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:37.560
but after your phone call, pieces all started
to fall into place

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.109
you always know what to say, Mick
aren't you going to introduce me to your lady

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:43.380
friend there?

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:47.779
Yeah, Mick this is Samantha Kelso, girl I
showed you the picture of

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:51.569
Glad to meet you miss Kelso, you're even prettier
than your photograph

01:09:51.569 --> 01:09:55.350
Hey Mick, you mind if I fill out the report
tomorrow?

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:59.250
I could use a little sack time
sure Jack, you look like you need the rest

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:22.700
Look they're gone!

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.310
And that just about wraps it up for this case.

01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:28.010
It sounds a lot more complicated than it really
was

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:32.110
hard to believe it all took place in a couple
of measly nights back in June when somebody

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:36.850
paid me a few bucks
to find their missing daughter

01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:41.480
I thought I should put all this down on paper
because they never did find the guy that called

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.330
himself the Master
I don't wanna appear paranoid or anything,

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:48.850
I just get a creepy feeling
when I think about that guy.

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:52.040
I mean sure, I saw Sam give him an unscheduled
appendectomy

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.790
but something deep down inside tells me we
haven't seen the last of him.

01:10:56.790 --> 01:11:00.430
I hope I'm wrong
Huh, I usually am.

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:04.980
This time I'd be glad to be wrong, but if
I'm not and something happens to Sam or me

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.600
I just thought there should be a record of
what we went through

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.660
maybe it can be of help to someone in the
future who might run into another chainsaw

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.940
cult
I'm sure there are others.

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:22.100
Oh yeah, as for Sam, she's a big girl, her
mother was happy when she heard Sam was safe

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.290
and I needed a secretary, like a hole in the
head

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:29.330
but she's a nice kid so maybe I'll let her
stay around a while

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:33.080
besides, she's got a great set of tits.

01:11:34.305 --> 01:11:40.521
