You should get a discount,
if you die visiting your beloved.

02:54.668 --> 02:57.318
I don't know why you
picked the hilltop.

02:57.418 --> 03:00.835
Not exactly like you
can take in the view.

03:04.835 --> 03:07.210
Anyway...

03:08.251 --> 03:10.460
Happy Birthday Sarah Elizabeth.

03:37.210 --> 03:41.501
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.

04:06.793 --> 04:11.793
You give me a present.
I'll give you a present.

04:17.043 --> 04:18.750
Bingo.

04:19.043 --> 04:24.276
Ten foot ceilings,
original Georgian classic cornices.

04:24.376 --> 04:27.443
We have rich quarter sawn oak floors.

04:27.543 --> 04:32.335
You don't find quality craftsmanship
in anything that is built today.

04:32.835 --> 04:35.460
We have a formal dining room.

04:37.376 --> 04:41.126
French doors opening to the patio.

04:41.335 --> 04:45.526
And this is the kitchen.
Double Viking Range.

04:45.626 --> 04:47.668
Too expensive.

04:48.876 --> 04:50.985
What? Are you an appraiser?

04:51.085 --> 04:53.568
5.7, 5.8 tops.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.193
Mister Little, I think
what Le Duc is asking

04:56.293 --> 04:59.335
is just whether there might be
a little wiggle room in the price?

05:00.793 --> 05:03.568
- He loves the house.
- Tour is over.

05:03.668 --> 05:08.110
Oren. Please. No one meant any
offense with the verbal offer.

05:08.210 --> 05:11.860
Let me explain something to you.
Wiggle room is squeezing into

05:11.960 --> 05:15.401
a pair of pants too small
and hoping they don't split.

05:15.501 --> 05:18.193
You got enough wiggle room
you can call extortion a loan.

05:18.293 --> 05:21.610
- Kidnapping, a get together.
- Point taken.

05:21.710 --> 05:24.693
Probably not the right term for
a three million dollar disparity.

05:24.793 --> 05:27.318
By the way, we're not Chinese.

05:27.418 --> 05:29.360
Rape is just another
sign of affection.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.668
- What do you mean you're not Chinese?
- Vietnamese.

05:33.001 --> 05:35.543
Well, I was in the area.

05:37.085 --> 05:39.818
Sorry this didn't work out, Oren.
He was a cash buyer.

05:39.918 --> 05:43.443
This house is worth 8.6 million,
that's what it's going to sell for.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.568
I have other clients flying in.
They saw the house on the Internet.

05:46.668 --> 05:47.860
Thursday at noon?

05:47.960 --> 05:51.335
- Where are they from?
- Black.

06:30.099 --> 06:36.100
<i>Hide your heart from sight</i>

06:38.098 --> 06:43.069
<i>Lock your dreams at night</i>

06:47.065 --> 06:52.171
<i>It could happen to you</i>

06:57.565 --> 07:02.829
<i>Don't count stars</i>

07:03.430 --> 07:06.336
<i>Or you might stumble</i>

07:12.060 --> 07:14.060
<i>Some...</i>

07:26.626 --> 07:28.751
I can't...

07:42.626 --> 07:44.085
Cats!

07:47.960 --> 07:51.960
Oh my, what are those kids doing here,
they came out of nowhere.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.526
Oh, my God.

07:53.626 --> 07:57.543
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye kids.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.628
- Oh, my gosh!
- Hey, Leah!

08:00.729 --> 08:02.364
- What?
- Is the noise okay?

08:02.465 --> 08:05.443
No. I love the commotion,
are you kidding?

08:05.543 --> 08:08.901
Look what I taught these guys.
Boys! Mister Little.

08:09.001 --> 08:11.651
Too much noise! Too much noise!

08:11.751 --> 08:16.193
I love that finger wag.
Nice touch guys. Oh, mojito, Kate?

08:16.293 --> 08:18.276
Oh, desperate for one.

08:18.376 --> 08:20.943
Too much noise! Too much noise!

08:21.043 --> 08:22.835
Dog!

08:25.418 --> 08:29.818
- Touch my car and I'll have you spayed.
- Neutered.

08:29.918 --> 08:33.318
For Pete's sake, cut their hair!
Dress them like men!

08:33.418 --> 08:37.025
Is what you're going to say really
worth what I'm about to say back.

08:37.126 --> 08:40.168
Oh, okay...

09:00.001 --> 09:02.568
- Would you care to join us, Mr. Little?
- Who's 'us'?

09:02.668 --> 09:06.585
- Kate. She's coming down for a mojito.
- Cheers.

09:09.626 --> 09:12.026
You know you should have let them
move downstairs with the children

09:12.126 --> 09:13.860
and then you could have
taken their apartment.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.568
This is the one that was available,
this is the one I took.

09:16.668 --> 09:20.396
But they told the manager they wanted
your place before it was even empty.

09:20.497 --> 09:24.068
So, if you ask me something
fishy went on for you...

09:24.168 --> 09:26.568
I was the number
one realtor in sales,

09:26.668 --> 09:30.026
seven years in a row,
back in the 90's. Entire county.

09:30.126 --> 09:32.110
I know everybody.

09:32.210 --> 09:34.776
And half of everybody I know,
thinks they know me, so...

09:34.876 --> 09:38.418
complain to the manager.

09:39.793 --> 09:42.110
- Give me the snake!
- No!

09:42.210 --> 09:44.068
Too much noise.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.985
Too much noise! Too much noise!

09:47.085 --> 09:51.376
If this is where number one lives?
God help number two.

10:49.418 --> 10:52.335
Hey, buddy.

10:52.501 --> 10:54.626
You all right?

10:54.793 --> 10:56.585
What's this?

10:58.585 --> 11:02.418
Now, what dumb ass would
shoot you with a paint ball gun.

11:04.043 --> 11:08.068
Okay, I like this drink,
but I think it's a little...

11:08.168 --> 11:11.585
- Evening.
- Hello!

11:12.543 --> 11:15.943
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.246
If he parked over just a little
bit we wouldn't have to hunt

11:18.347 --> 11:22.360
- for a space on the street.
- Complain to the manager.

11:22.460 --> 11:25.901
- Hey, Peter. How was that water?
- Choppy.

11:26.001 --> 11:28.735
- Choppy?
- Let's get you out of this wet suit.

11:28.835 --> 11:32.735
Put this guy on, put the towel up.

11:32.835 --> 11:36.651
Is that enough for you?

11:36.751 --> 11:39.443
For Pete's sake, will you cover your
dick, I'm trying to eat a sandwich.

11:39.543 --> 11:42.251
Is that language really necessary?

11:42.376 --> 11:45.943
- Complain to the manager.
- We have. Everyone has.

11:46.043 --> 11:48.026
- Well, I...
- Oh, everyone?

11:48.126 --> 11:49.610
And we're calling again tomorrow

11:49.710 --> 11:51.610
to tell her how rude
and selfish you are.

11:51.710 --> 11:55.318
So I got a dick in my face,
right, somehow I'm to blame.

11:55.418 --> 11:57.026
He said dick!

11:57.126 --> 12:00.526
- Okay...
- You called the manager on me, huh?

12:00.626 --> 12:02.818
Yeah, a number of times actually.

12:02.918 --> 12:04.526
Well, during one of those times

12:04.626 --> 12:09.293
did she happen to mention
that I own this building.

12:09.876 --> 12:12.960
- You own...
- Little Shangri-la.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.793
Little...

12:17.626 --> 12:20.251
Shangri-la.

12:21.210 --> 12:25.585
Something to think about the next
time you get an itch to rat me out.

12:27.126 --> 12:29.735
Look, I don't care if you
do own the building.

12:29.835 --> 12:32.026
My wife is going to give birth soon.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.193
Yesterday we had to park a block away

12:35.293 --> 12:38.193
because you refuse to move
your car just a few feet.

12:38.293 --> 12:40.485
Please share the drive way.

12:40.585 --> 12:43.918
- Or what?
- Or nothing.

12:44.668 --> 12:47.210
I'm asking as a favor.

12:51.793 --> 12:56.251
You need to have a
little compassion. Okay?

12:57.585 --> 13:00.126
Sorry about my dick.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.543
Okay...

13:17.960 --> 13:21.168
My wife died of cancer.

13:22.460 --> 13:26.193
For two years, I bathed her,
I changed her...

13:26.293 --> 13:28.735
I cooked for her. I fed her.

13:28.835 --> 13:31.610
I even prayed for her.

13:31.710 --> 13:36.210
And I cried all I'm
ever going to cry.

13:36.335 --> 13:38.668
I had compassion.

13:57.585 --> 13:59.693
- Claire.
- Oren.

13:59.793 --> 14:04.210
- Good morning, Oren. Today at noon?
- Wouldn't miss it, Teddy.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.860
The house is not worth 8 million.
And it's 'Ted.'

14:07.960 --> 14:11.460
8.6 million, Teddy.

14:12.626 --> 14:15.985
- How long have you been in the business?
- Seven years, as you well know.

14:16.085 --> 14:19.110
- Everyday is better than the last.
- Don't be a smart ass.

14:19.210 --> 14:21.860
We've been here since your
Grandfather started this business

14:21.960 --> 14:25.485
44 years ago. So where do you
get the gall to second guess

14:25.585 --> 14:29.276
- the listing of an Oren Little?
- I don't have gall, Grandma.

14:29.376 --> 14:32.651
I have comps. And they
don't support an 8 million...

14:32.751 --> 14:36.610
Excuse me, an 8.6
million dollar list price.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.193
When he was a baby,
he used to play with his willy

14:39.293 --> 14:42.668
like it was a rambunctious puppy.

14:43.335 --> 14:47.151
All I need is just one last sale
before I cast my line in the river.

14:47.251 --> 14:50.651
And if he can help me,
I'll play with his willy.

14:50.751 --> 14:53.193
The only way you're going to get
anywhere near a river is if you...

14:53.293 --> 14:55.485
lower the asking price.

14:55.585 --> 14:58.901
You'll get 5.8, not a penny more.

14:59.001 --> 15:03.376
And you'll get hit by a bus if the
driver does what he's paid to do.

15:04.418 --> 15:10.110
That's a Viking 48H duel fuel range.
With a convection oven.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.318
A Sub-Zero refrigerator and freezer.

15:13.418 --> 15:17.276
Both energy star and Kosher certified

15:17.376 --> 15:20.876
- if you're Sammy Davis Junior.
- Who?

15:23.876 --> 15:25.401
Look at this, two of them here

15:25.501 --> 15:27.943
and neither one of them knows
who Sammy Davis Junior is.

15:28.043 --> 15:30.068
Who is he?

15:30.168 --> 15:31.985
Oh, Jesus Christ.

15:32.085 --> 15:34.318
We have a Thermador
dishwasher here...

15:34.418 --> 15:38.626
and Clive Christian cabinetry
all the way around.

15:45.585 --> 15:49.793
If you'll wait outside I'll
join you after the showing.

15:50.085 --> 15:53.235
- You're selling our house?
- One client at a time.

15:53.335 --> 15:57.668
- I thought Common owned this house.
- Who's Common?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.485
- Dad?
- One client at a time, Luke!

16:03.585 --> 16:05.555
We've seen enough.

16:05.656 --> 16:10.743
The children's bedrooms
and game room are upstairs.

16:20.085 --> 16:24.193
I like the new kitchen.
So is my bedroom the same...

16:24.293 --> 16:28.618
or did you put a picture of a kid
who's not an addict in that room?

16:29.418 --> 16:31.693
What are you doing here?

16:31.793 --> 16:34.084
I don't know, I thought I
should check in every death

16:34.185 --> 16:37.343
or ten years, whichever comes first.

16:37.543 --> 16:41.918
You still got the scar from
rolling down the hill.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.743
Yeah, you shouldn't buried
mom on a mountaintop.

16:45.443 --> 16:50.110
It was a hill. And the only reason you
rolled down it is cause you were so high,

16:50.210 --> 16:53.443
you passed out and hit
your head on a gravestone.

16:53.543 --> 16:56.651
- Well, I'm sober now.
- Well, good for you.

16:56.751 --> 16:58.793
And I'm going to prison.

16:59.626 --> 17:01.568
Perfect.

17:01.668 --> 17:05.359
- I shouldn't ask you this...
- That's a bad start to a sentence.

17:05.460 --> 17:09.376
I need you to take care of
my daughter while I'm gone.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.443
You've got a daughter?

17:16.542 --> 17:21.292
Heroin's an ugly drug that
gave me a beautiful girl.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.835
Her name is Sarah.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.859
- That was your mother's name!
- She'll be ten next month.

17:27.960 --> 17:32.376
- She's got no where else to go, Dad.
- Where's the mother?

17:34.460 --> 17:37.001
The mother's family?

17:41.293 --> 17:43.793
I'm going to have to say no.

17:44.876 --> 17:47.485
- They're going to send her to foster care.
- I'm living in a four-plex.

17:47.585 --> 17:51.443
I've got all my things there.
I can barely turn around.

17:51.543 --> 17:54.566
It's only 9 months.
6 months with good behavior.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.601
I can't.

18:02.501 --> 18:07.735
Look, if I had anybody else I
could turn to, I wouldn't be here.

18:07.835 --> 18:12.210
I already tried to raise a kid.
It didn't work out.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.964
<i>Heaven</i>

18:21.064 --> 18:23.964
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

18:24.165 --> 18:30.596
<i>And my heart beats so
that I can barely speak</i>

18:30.897 --> 18:34.193
<i>- And I seem to find the happiness I seek</i>
- You, a grandfather.

18:34.293 --> 18:37.735
Christ and ice and
Mary in a penalty box!

18:37.835 --> 18:41.365
I'd escape to that cabin
of yours right now.

18:41.465 --> 18:44.896
<i>Out together dancing</i>

18:44.996 --> 18:51.930
<i>Out together dancing cheek to cheek</i>

18:55.210 --> 18:57.710
Thank you!

19:02.001 --> 19:07.293
This next song...

19:07.460 --> 19:09.793
Oh, my gosh.

19:10.501 --> 19:13.668
Anyway, oh, dear, what is this?

19:14.168 --> 19:16.818
Congratulations to Dan and Samantha.
Is that what you're telling me.

19:16.918 --> 19:19.568
Dan, Samantha where are you?
There you are.

19:19.668 --> 19:24.110
I'm so happy for you, it's your
30th wedding anniversary.

19:24.210 --> 19:26.960
- Thank you.
- 30 years.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.276
You know I was married for 30 years.

19:31.376 --> 19:35.543
And I know if my husband hadn't
died of an undetected aneurism...

19:35.960 --> 19:41.293
he'd be with me here tonight.
And we'd be singing...

19:42.996 --> 19:45.633
<i>Blue moon</i>

19:48.085 --> 19:50.610
Ma'am, there's no smoking in here.

19:50.710 --> 19:54.335
Good, you're too young to smoke.

19:56.097 --> 19:59.996
<i>Without a dream in my heart</i>

20:00.168 --> 20:04.293
What kind of act is this?
All she does is cry.

20:04.918 --> 20:07.251
I can't...

20:07.460 --> 20:11.293
I'm going to go over there for now.
Just going to get some air.

20:22.668 --> 20:25.960
Little Shangri-la.

21:16.751 --> 21:19.360
Oh, my God... I'm sorry I
thought I heard somebody.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.485
Are you okay?

21:21.585 --> 21:24.168
No, yeah. I'm fine.

21:24.668 --> 21:26.751
It's just something that I do.

21:27.376 --> 21:29.943
- You are a good cook.
- Really?

21:30.043 --> 21:33.860
My wife, she was a good cook.
Sarah Elizabeth.

21:33.960 --> 21:38.710
- Sarah Beth.
- Beautiful name.

21:40.376 --> 21:42.168
Eugene.

21:43.251 --> 21:48.501
Not so much in the name you know, but...
He was a really beautiful man.

21:48.751 --> 21:51.501
Not at all in the name.

21:52.126 --> 21:54.901
Do people really let you
get away with being you.

21:55.001 --> 21:57.776
Are you going to eat all this?

21:57.876 --> 22:01.943
- No, no. Would you like some?
- Only if you're...

22:02.043 --> 22:04.943
I'll get you a plate, okay.

22:05.043 --> 22:08.335
And maybe a glass.

22:11.876 --> 22:14.693
You have a very nice voice.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.901
You think so? I don't know.

22:18.001 --> 22:22.543
- Haunting.
- Well, thank you, I guess.

22:24.876 --> 22:29.651
Your patter on the other hand.

22:29.751 --> 22:33.943
I know, I know. I just started
this singing thing, I can't like...

22:34.043 --> 22:36.485
you like...

22:36.585 --> 22:40.943
It won't... You know, I don't know,
it's like out of my mouth.

22:41.043 --> 22:45.485
I think it's a basic rule that between
songs you keep any references

22:45.585 --> 22:48.985
to aneurisms or dead loved
ones down to a minimum.

22:49.085 --> 22:51.110
Yeah, I know. I gotta work on that.

22:51.210 --> 22:54.235
And when you sing 'Cry me a river',

22:54.335 --> 22:56.276
it doesn't have to
be the whole river.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.026
Right, I do get a little emotional.

22:59.126 --> 23:01.293
So you've said.

23:01.626 --> 23:05.793
- This is really good pasta.
- So you've said...

23:14.251 --> 23:18.501
- You ever just run out of things to say?
- No.

23:23.126 --> 23:25.626
Good pasta.

23:51.293 --> 23:52.960
You!

23:56.251 --> 24:00.001
- What do you think you're doing?
- It's just nine months.

24:00.418 --> 24:03.860
- I told you, I have no room.
- What's going on?

24:03.960 --> 24:07.418
It's my son. He's on his way to jail.

24:09.751 --> 24:11.526
But who's that?

24:11.626 --> 24:14.610
That's my granddaughter.
She's probably Guatemalan.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.735
- What?
- He had sex with a maid once.

24:16.835 --> 24:20.501
Dad, this is Sarah.
Sarah this is your...

24:21.710 --> 24:24.793
- Oren.
- Nice to meet you.

24:26.210 --> 24:30.126
You're pretty. Do you know that?
Oh my God, look at you.

24:32.168 --> 24:35.943
Look how beautiful you are. I'm Leah.

24:36.043 --> 24:39.151
- How old are you?
- Ten on my birthday.

24:39.251 --> 24:41.710
Next Friday.

24:42.801 --> 24:44.343
Okay.

24:45.085 --> 24:46.597
Daddy's got to go now, okay?

24:46.698 --> 24:50.018
- I'm going to write you everyday.
- No.

24:51.168 --> 24:55.543
- I love you so much.
- Don't leave me! No, no.

24:56.043 --> 24:58.068
It's okay. Grandpa's going
to take care of you.

24:58.168 --> 25:01.751
Oh, now I'm grandpa?
What happened to Oren?

25:07.001 --> 25:10.651
Don't worry. It's going to be okay.

25:10.751 --> 25:12.943
I'm going to make sure
that you're safe.

25:13.043 --> 25:16.918
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25:18.376 --> 25:21.276
Hey, wait a minute.
What's, what's with the dog?

25:21.376 --> 25:25.401
He's a stray, I found him by
the house. Sarah loves him.

25:25.501 --> 25:28.360
- She named him Paint.
- Here, it's okay.

25:28.460 --> 25:33.860
You want to come inside,
have some ice cream?

25:33.960 --> 25:36.543
Let's go.

25:41.126 --> 25:43.251
Let's go.

25:49.501 --> 25:54.085
What is it with you?
You only shit where I live?

25:58.418 --> 26:01.376
Am I going to stay here with you?

26:02.043 --> 26:06.668
Well, I don't really know.
I mean, this is all kind of new.

26:12.210 --> 26:16.376
- Can I have some more ice cream?
- Of course you can.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.426
One second.

26:22.626 --> 26:23.590
Is she okay?

26:23.691 --> 26:26.068
- Well, she's calmed down.
- Good, good.

26:26.168 --> 26:30.318
- I've got to go to work...
- Slow down. What's the game plan here?

26:30.418 --> 26:32.943
I don't know. I don't know.

26:33.043 --> 26:35.943
- Can you watch her for today?
- Yeah, sure I can watch her, but...

26:36.043 --> 26:41.210
- Just a second...
- I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out.

26:43.085 --> 26:46.568
Now I'm the shit bag.
I'm not the one going to jail.

26:46.668 --> 26:49.943
You know what Luke was thinking
when he was rolling down that hill?

26:50.043 --> 26:51.526
He wasn't thinking.

26:51.626 --> 26:53.610
Or he wouldn't have shown up
stoned at his mother's funeral.

26:53.710 --> 26:59.485
He was thinking that the last person
who really loved him had just died.

26:59.585 --> 27:02.985
- You know what he did to land in jail?
- I didn't ask, no.

27:03.085 --> 27:07.526
Nothing. He was bullied and
threatened by the SEC.

27:07.626 --> 27:11.568
To rat out his boss over
some back dating stock crap.

27:11.668 --> 27:13.985
They intimidated him
with a long sentence.

27:14.085 --> 27:16.901
Called him a co-conspirator.

27:17.001 --> 27:19.970
Then they offered a plea deal.
The only reason he took it

27:20.071 --> 27:23.776
was because he didn't want to
be away from Sarah for so long.

27:23.876 --> 27:27.318
- Good for him.
- You wanna hear the kicker?

27:27.418 --> 27:30.235
The charges against
his boss, were dropped.

27:30.335 --> 27:32.818
But Luke had already been sentenced.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.860
So, he's going to jail
for someone no one did.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.460
How do you know all this?

27:44.043 --> 27:47.735
I googled him.
I friended him on facebook.

27:47.835 --> 27:49.918
We've been texting.

27:52.835 --> 27:55.710
If you want to keep
in contact with him.

27:55.876 --> 27:58.501
You should be proud of him.

28:31.293 --> 28:35.026
Figure it out mean, ignore the
situation and hope that it goes away.

28:35.126 --> 28:36.894
I'm working on things, okay.

28:36.995 --> 28:38.735
- Where is the girl now?
- The girl?

28:38.835 --> 28:42.193
- The Guatemalan? My granddaughter.
- She's drawing.

28:42.293 --> 28:44.535
- I will pay you to watch her.
- I don't want your money.

28:44.635 --> 28:48.326
- It'll only be for a few days.
- What do you mean a few days?

28:48.426 --> 28:51.259
Don't worry about it,
I'm going to find her mother.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.185
Look what I drew.

28:53.335 --> 28:57.651
Oh, well, that is terrific.

28:57.751 --> 29:01.793
- What do you think of that, Oren?
- Yeah, that's a horse.

29:03.593 --> 29:06.610
You know what I think Sarah.
I think you should go inside.

29:06.710 --> 29:08.901
And I think you should
put on your pajamas

29:09.001 --> 29:13.043
- and then you'll spend the night with me.
- Okay.

29:16.293 --> 29:17.693
What is the matter with you?

29:17.793 --> 29:20.693
You can't possibly be as
heartless as you seem.

29:20.793 --> 29:26.043
- Yeah. Well, thanks for...
- You have a real good night, Oren.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.793
Okay. Good day.

29:34.393 --> 29:37.933
So you let me know if you
need anything at all.

29:38.034 --> 29:40.937
- Okay.
- Good night, Sarah.

29:41.038 --> 29:44.526
Everything's going to be okay.

29:44.626 --> 29:46.710
Yeah...

30:16.960 --> 30:21.960
- Do I have to be alone?
- No. Come here.

30:22.710 --> 30:25.735
Come on in. Come here, Sarah.

30:25.835 --> 30:29.943
Of course not, here...
quick into bed, here.

30:30.043 --> 30:34.851
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

30:43.918 --> 30:46.918
Here you go, Paint.
Here you go. There you go.

30:51.710 --> 30:54.876
- You want to go out and play, Sarah?
- No.

30:55.626 --> 30:58.376
It's a beautiful day out.

31:07.251 --> 31:09.360
Sarah, do you like caterpillars?

31:09.460 --> 31:12.443
- I don't know.
- You like butterflies, right?

31:12.543 --> 31:14.276
I guess.

31:14.376 --> 31:18.735
Do you know that Native Americans
believe that butterflies

31:18.835 --> 31:22.276
carry wishes to the great spirits
in heaven to be granted.

31:22.376 --> 31:24.943
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

31:25.043 --> 31:27.763
You want to go and try and
catch some caterpillars?

31:27.864 --> 31:31.985
- How?
- Well... I know a place.

31:32.085 --> 31:35.526
- Where caterpillars are?
- Oh, sometimes.

31:35.626 --> 31:40.043
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's do it.

32:10.293 --> 32:11.860
Jason?

32:11.960 --> 32:13.960
You look good.

32:14.418 --> 32:16.318
Working out?

32:16.418 --> 32:18.001
Mister Little?

32:19.293 --> 32:22.286
- Would you like to come in?
- Sure.

32:22.387 --> 32:25.643
Let me just clean up a little.

32:27.960 --> 32:31.318
I'm looking for Sarah's mother.

32:31.418 --> 32:33.668
- Luke's Sarah?
- That's the one, yeah.

32:33.793 --> 32:37.651
Oh, man, what was her name?

32:37.751 --> 32:40.543
I have no clue where
that chick has gone to.

32:40.710 --> 32:45.585
Well, Jason, I got a hundred
dollars in my wallet.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.297
Think of all the nice
chemicals you can buy.

32:49.398 --> 32:52.960
- It's Rita.
- Where does she live?

32:53.793 --> 32:56.860
- I don't know.
- Too bad for you.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.943
- I know where her parents used to live.
- Her parents?

33:00.043 --> 33:04.693
I kept the address 'cause we used
to break in to take stuff to sell,

33:04.793 --> 33:08.693
- when we got desperate.
- You sure they don't live there anymore.

33:08.793 --> 33:12.210
They moved. They kept getting robbed.

33:14.376 --> 33:16.293
Jason...

33:16.918 --> 33:19.335
why didn't you steal from me?

33:20.126 --> 33:22.585
Luke wouldn't let us.

33:26.043 --> 33:27.943
How can he not just fall in love.

33:28.043 --> 33:30.735
Really, I don't think he's ever
gotten over his wife's death.

33:30.835 --> 33:32.860
It's hard to imagine
him loving anyone.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.943
Can Caleb and Dylan have popsicles?

33:36.043 --> 33:41.793
Only if you give me a kiss. And I
want my kiss right on my nose.

33:43.043 --> 33:45.901
Okay! Now we're talking.

33:46.001 --> 33:51.085
One, two... and we got three.
Three popsicles, go. Have fun.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.251
Stay away from that one,
he showed me his penis.

34:02.376 --> 34:05.443
You're really a detective with the
Bridgeport Police Department.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.110
I'm still allowed to have some fun.

34:07.210 --> 34:09.467
There's something about seeing
the law in a bathing suit

34:09.568 --> 34:12.976
- that just doesn't fit right.
- You came over to tell me that?

34:14.918 --> 34:17.985
I was wondering if you could find
the people that owned this house,

34:18.085 --> 34:19.318
10 years ago.

34:19.418 --> 34:21.360
I don't think I can do that, Oren.

34:21.460 --> 34:27.210
It's amazing how nicely our two
cars fit together side by side.

34:33.085 --> 34:38.275
- I used to love the slip n' slide.
- Well, I'm sure you did.

34:38.376 --> 34:41.568
- I'll be right out!
- Okay, take your time.

34:41.668 --> 34:44.400
- You're the piano player.
- Yeah.

34:44.501 --> 34:47.275
Artie Burns. I play with
Leah at the Oaks Bistro.

34:47.376 --> 34:50.025
- What are you doing here?
- I came here to pick her up.

34:50.126 --> 34:51.943
- You mean on a date?
- Yeah.

34:52.043 --> 34:57.710
You're not her type.
She likes the men with actual hair.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.262
- Well, I've been going with her...
- Sleeping with her?

35:00.363 --> 35:04.835
- Well, no.
- I am. Don't embarrass yourself.

35:19.376 --> 35:22.862
- Hey! You told him we had sex!
- How much they pay you?

35:22.963 --> 35:25.235
- Did you tell him we had sex?
- How much?

35:25.335 --> 35:29.360
- $600. But that's not the point.
- They are stealing from you.

35:29.460 --> 35:34.651
- The food is shit. They come for you.
- I don't know.

35:34.751 --> 35:39.735
- Okay, thank you.
- I told you. You have a beautiful voice.

35:39.835 --> 35:41.735
Particularly when you make it
all the way through a song.

35:41.835 --> 35:44.188
I can get you a job that
pays twice as much.

35:44.289 --> 35:45.612
- What?
- From now on,

35:45.713 --> 35:47.907
- I'm going to be your agent.
- You're insane.

35:48.008 --> 35:51.072
- I don't what you're talking about.
- I'm a salesman, that's what I do.

35:51.173 --> 35:53.026
I know a hot property when I see one.

35:53.126 --> 35:57.501
- Hot property? This is a hot property?
- You bet your ass.

35:58.960 --> 36:02.943
Look, I... I don't need
an agent actually.

36:03.043 --> 36:05.526
- Yes, you do.
- No, I really don't need an agent.

36:05.626 --> 36:07.976
And if I did, it certainly wouldn't be you.
You don't have the qualifications.

36:08.076 --> 36:11.015
- What are your qualifications for example.
- Here's my qualifications.

36:11.116 --> 36:17.193
You don't have to pay me rent until
I find you a job at 1200 a week.

36:17.293 --> 36:18.818
- Really?
- Really.

36:18.918 --> 36:21.600
- Leah, I'm ready.
- I got to go. I got to go.

36:21.701 --> 36:26.710
- I consider that an oral contract.
- I... I don't think so...

36:29.876 --> 36:32.001
How old are you?

36:32.251 --> 36:34.985
Ten on Friday. Dad told you.

36:35.085 --> 36:37.829
Does your mom ever visit
you on your birthday?

36:37.930 --> 36:39.901
I don't know my mom.

36:40.001 --> 36:44.376
- What about grandparents.
- You're my grandparent.

36:44.918 --> 36:49.043
- Aren't you?
- Yeah, I guess, yeah.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.393
Are you a hoarder?

36:54.493 --> 37:00.851
What? No. I'm storing
things until I can escape.

37:01.043 --> 37:05.526
- You want one slice of bologna or two?
- Two. With one cheese in the middle.

37:05.626 --> 37:08.501
- All right, you got it.
- No mayo.

37:09.001 --> 37:12.585
- Butter.
- I knew that.

37:15.460 --> 37:19.651
- Where are you escaping to, Oren?
- I'm moving to Vermont.

37:19.751 --> 37:22.168
More butter, please.

37:22.876 --> 37:26.710
- Would you like to do this yourself?
- Only if you do it wrong.

37:28.001 --> 37:31.376
Daddy and I went to Vermont
last year when I was eight.

37:31.476 --> 37:33.943
We got to fly there.
And he taught me how to fish.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.726
I taught your Dad how to fish.

37:36.826 --> 37:40.151
The place we stayed at had
salt shakers shaped like cows.

37:40.251 --> 37:43.043
That's where I'm going.

37:43.668 --> 37:45.568
He always said he hated it up there.

37:45.668 --> 37:49.335
I think he liked going
up there with me.

37:49.543 --> 37:53.543
Take that box, put it on that box
that's on that box over there.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.668
Good girl.

38:12.126 --> 38:15.693
Don't give the dog human food.
It teaches him how to beg.

38:15.793 --> 38:19.443
- You gave him mayonnaise bread.
- No, I didn't.

38:19.543 --> 38:21.276
I saw you.

38:21.376 --> 38:25.026
You're gonna make someone
a great wife someday.

38:25.126 --> 38:27.193
- I like the sandwich.
- Thank you.

38:27.293 --> 38:29.776
So, what are you doing
with these bugs?

38:29.876 --> 38:34.918
They're caterpillars. Me and Leah
are doing a science project.

38:35.335 --> 38:37.610
Good for you.

38:37.710 --> 38:39.901
- Want to watch some TV?
- Sure.

38:40.001 --> 38:43.901
I don't watch animation,
MTV, Bravo, Oprah...

38:44.001 --> 38:48.610
or sitcoms. What do
you want to watch?

38:48.710 --> 38:52.526
- Can we watch Duck Dynasty?
- What station is it on?

38:52.626 --> 38:55.001
- A&E.
- Sure.

39:20.126 --> 39:22.151
Back so soon...

39:22.251 --> 39:25.860
- Hello.
- What happened? No chemistry, huh?

39:25.960 --> 39:28.901
Right... How'd it go with you two?

39:29.001 --> 39:30.985
She fell asleep.

39:31.085 --> 39:35.526
You want to come in and watch
the end of Duck Dynasty?

39:35.626 --> 39:36.943
I think I'm going to have to pass,

39:37.043 --> 39:38.526
but you can carry
her over to my place.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.276
My back. I got a bad back.

39:41.376 --> 39:43.610
You know what, you can wake
her up or just lift her up.

39:43.710 --> 39:44.943
Forget it, I don't care.

39:45.043 --> 39:49.276
- What's with you?
- What am I doing with my life!

39:49.376 --> 39:51.901
You know, I'm a
wanna-be lounge singer.

39:52.001 --> 39:56.360
- With a shark for an agent.
- No, it's ridiculous. I'm 65, ugh!

39:56.460 --> 40:01.026
I have sold houses, older than you.
And in a lot worse condition.

40:01.126 --> 40:04.668
That makes me feel good.

40:05.376 --> 40:07.668
Yeah.

40:09.293 --> 40:12.043
It was a compliment.

40:21.585 --> 40:25.610
- Where do you want me to put her?
- Just put her over there, thank you.

40:25.710 --> 40:29.668
Do you need... are you all right?
Here, thank you.

40:32.001 --> 40:35.776
I forgot how soundly they sleep.

40:35.876 --> 40:39.251
True. Look at her.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.835
This looks like a Eugene.

40:54.710 --> 40:57.860
And what does a Eugene look like?

40:57.960 --> 41:00.751
Like someone who loved you.

41:07.501 --> 41:11.068
Last time I had sex I tore my ACL.

41:11.168 --> 41:12.360
Is this relevant to anything?

41:12.460 --> 41:15.360
I just thought it was some
information you should have.

41:15.460 --> 41:19.610
Is this by any chance,
some pathetic attempt at flirtation?

41:19.710 --> 41:21.526
Well, when you put it that way... no.

41:21.626 --> 41:24.210
Good night, Oren.

41:37.668 --> 41:40.210
- Buenos Dias.
- Hello.

41:40.501 --> 41:42.235
His English isn't very good.

41:42.335 --> 41:47.901
This house is 8.6 million dollars.

41:48.001 --> 41:50.860
- Did you know that?
- It says so on the brochure.

41:50.960 --> 41:56.110
- You read English?
- It was in numbers. But I do read.

41:56.210 --> 41:59.710
Okay, why don't we
start in the living room.

42:03.585 --> 42:06.985
You've got 10 foot ceilings.
Mouldings.

42:07.085 --> 42:09.776
Floors. Plaster mantle.

42:10.918 --> 42:14.026
- What did he say?
- His papa was a plasterer.

42:14.126 --> 42:17.418
Everybody's gotta do something.

42:17.710 --> 42:20.985
- Wait, look.
- The large shell...

42:21.085 --> 42:22.441
What, you're kidding me.

42:22.542 --> 42:24.110
- But that lizard has a...
- Hey.

42:24.210 --> 42:25.360
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

42:25.460 --> 42:30.235
These guys they're looking for
an upgrade to a larger home.

42:30.335 --> 42:32.873
- Okay. You know they're caterpillars.
- Yeah, I know.

42:32.974 --> 42:35.735
- We're just doing a science project.
- Okay.

42:35.835 --> 42:40.335
- Is this your granddaughter?
- Yes.

42:45.335 --> 42:49.776
You know what. I need to go
get something for Paint, all right.

42:49.876 --> 42:52.168
You pick out the terrarium
that you want, okay.

43:02.543 --> 43:04.068
Okay... Okay...

43:04.168 --> 43:07.693
- So, where are you all from?
- Texas.

43:07.793 --> 43:13.318
I have a list of 40 states I try
to avoid. Texas is number seven.

43:13.418 --> 43:16.318
Can I get you anything
to drink, water? Soda? Beer?

43:16.418 --> 43:19.485
Thank you, we have two
other places to look at.

43:19.585 --> 43:22.793
Excuse me. Oren Little.

43:23.293 --> 43:25.585
Speak.

43:26.293 --> 43:30.085
You stay right there,
I'm coming right now.

43:30.376 --> 43:34.626
Well, I wish you the best of
luck on your search and...

43:34.960 --> 43:38.210
Yes, it's a hell of a
lot of lawn to mow.

43:41.793 --> 43:46.026
- So what have you got?
- The family that owned the house is dead.

43:46.126 --> 43:49.696
But, they have a daughter,
she still leaves in the county.

43:49.797 --> 43:51.748
- If that's of interest.
- Might be.

43:51.849 --> 43:54.568
Unfortunately, I'm not allowed
to give you the address.

43:54.668 --> 43:57.901
What did you bring me
down here for then?

43:58.001 --> 44:00.760
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

44:01.793 --> 44:06.901
- You want anything?
- Really. This is how it works?

44:07.001 --> 44:08.935
Look, either you break
the law or I do.

44:09.035 --> 44:10.901
I'm a detective and you're desperate.

44:11.001 --> 44:14.085
Who do you think's more
likely to be stupid.

44:27.001 --> 44:30.151
I think we gotta look for a bigger
place. Peter needs his own room.

44:30.251 --> 44:33.485
If you use Oren if might give
you a kick back the commission

44:33.585 --> 44:35.151
just to get rid of you.

44:35.251 --> 44:37.901
The advantages of a
intolerable relationship.

44:38.001 --> 44:42.360
He is good at what he does.
I do think that.

44:42.460 --> 44:44.710
Sarah.

44:45.376 --> 44:49.784
- Happy Birthday. I found your mother.
- It's not my birthday.

44:49.885 --> 44:53.985
But you'll be with your mother on Friday.
And you can take this with you.

44:54.085 --> 44:57.110
Guys, step back will ya,
you're making me nervous.

44:57.210 --> 45:00.151
Boys! Leave Mister Little alone.

45:00.251 --> 45:03.376
- Too much noise!
- Dog!

45:05.251 --> 45:08.443
And I bet you think your kids are funny.
What do you think I'm stupid?

45:08.543 --> 45:11.210
Would you be my realtor?

45:14.376 --> 45:18.818
- Is my mother nice?
- I haven't met her, but I'll bet she is.

45:18.918 --> 45:20.860
What do you mean you
haven't met her yet.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.860
I talked to her on the phone.

45:22.960 --> 45:26.276
Seemed nice. And surprised.

45:26.376 --> 45:28.610
Do I have to go?

45:28.710 --> 45:31.693
Me and grandma haven't finished
our science project yet.

45:31.793 --> 45:35.110
She wants to meet you, all right.
So I'm going to get your suitcase.

45:35.210 --> 45:37.610
You get your toothbrush
and your PJ's.

45:37.710 --> 45:40.110
- And you can spend the night together.
- I don't know her!

45:40.210 --> 45:42.735
She's your mother.

45:42.835 --> 45:47.126
- Do I have to?
- Let me handle this.

45:49.126 --> 45:51.276
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk.

45:51.376 --> 45:55.019
Did you even consider her feelings.
Her father's in jail...

45:55.120 --> 45:58.254
- she's never even met this woman.
- You think I didn't check her out?

45:58.355 --> 46:00.151
- She's clean?
- Clean?

46:00.251 --> 46:02.526
That's right, she's not
doing heroin anymore.

46:02.626 --> 46:04.093
You're sending her
to live with a junkie!

46:04.194 --> 46:08.026
- Former junkie.
- No, you're not! You are not.

46:08.126 --> 46:11.585
- No!
- I am her legal guardian.

46:11.685 --> 46:14.985
The only one that out ranks me
is her mother. You don't count.

46:15.085 --> 46:18.693
Now if you're looking for someone
to mother at your late stage in life.

46:18.793 --> 46:22.568
I suggest you get a dog.
I got one you can have too.

46:22.668 --> 46:25.401
You think it's a quick fix to give
her a mother she doesn't know?

46:25.501 --> 46:27.693
You know, I don't believe
you've ever loved anybody!

46:27.793 --> 46:30.943
Not your son, your grand
daughter or your wife!

46:31.043 --> 46:33.568
Don't you talk about my wife.

46:33.668 --> 46:35.568
When did it happen, Oren?

46:35.668 --> 46:39.276
When she died? Did you bury
all your feeling for her.

46:39.376 --> 46:41.960
Or where you always like this.

46:43.501 --> 46:46.710
Does she have more kids besides me?

46:47.126 --> 46:49.151
I'm not sure honey,
there might be more.

46:49.251 --> 46:52.026
- Will you be with me?
- Of course I'm going to be with you.

46:52.126 --> 46:56.126
Grandma's going to help you pack.
Aren't you grandma?

46:58.501 --> 47:00.818
Might as well take everything,
just in case you like her.

47:00.918 --> 47:05.193
Daddy takes me to Bristol
Playland on my birthday.

47:05.293 --> 47:08.110
He wrote me another letter.
Would you like to read it.

47:08.210 --> 47:11.001
Not now, honey. No.

47:23.626 --> 47:28.526
I understand you need
a real estate agent.

47:28.626 --> 47:33.985
I did teach them to say what they
say when they hear your name.

47:34.085 --> 47:38.068
And I did think it was funny,
but not anymore. Not at all.

47:38.168 --> 47:40.870
So what kind of property
are you looking for?

47:40.971 --> 47:42.901
A house, a lease?

47:43.001 --> 47:48.585
- Mommy! The dog and the bear are dancing!
- Like you and daddy!

48:18.793 --> 48:21.460
Oh, give me that teddy bear.

48:23.001 --> 48:26.585
- I'm scared grandma.
- Come on.

48:50.293 --> 48:52.585
Sarah?

48:53.835 --> 48:56.126
Is that you?

48:59.710 --> 49:02.543
You're so beautiful.

49:02.835 --> 49:04.651
Let me look at you.

49:04.752 --> 49:07.960
You know this is only a
temporary situation here.

49:08.501 --> 49:10.793
Come here.

49:12.793 --> 49:15.126
Can I get a hug?

49:26.710 --> 49:29.510
There hasn't been a day
since you were born

49:29.610 --> 49:32.568
that I don't think about you, baby.

49:32.668 --> 49:37.001
I'm so happy to have my baby back!

49:38.710 --> 49:41.168
Do we have to stay?

49:41.501 --> 49:44.110
No, you do not have to stay.

49:44.210 --> 49:48.235
- What?
- This is Sarah's birthday.

49:48.335 --> 49:52.901
And I thought it would be nice
for Sarah to meet her mother.

49:53.001 --> 49:57.418
And now she has...
And it's been a lovely visit.

49:58.168 --> 50:00.443
Maybe we can do this again sometime.

50:00.543 --> 50:03.026
And you have a good day.
Sarah, we got things to do.

50:03.126 --> 50:05.293
What things?

50:07.793 --> 50:11.918
- Stop it! Stop it!
- No more spinning for me.

50:12.668 --> 50:16.751
No more spinning.

50:20.085 --> 50:22.901
I want to go on it again,
let's go on it again!

50:23.001 --> 50:26.276
No, sweetie, I think there's so
much more to see in the park.

50:26.376 --> 50:30.610
Honey, let's go to the
bean bag toss. Okay?

50:30.710 --> 50:33.276
- That's always exciting.
- Bean bags?

50:33.376 --> 50:37.110
Yeah, you toss the bean bag
and you get a big prize.

50:37.210 --> 50:40.776
- Great idea.
- I want to go on the flying swings.

50:40.876 --> 50:43.985
The flying and the swinging,
it's not... you know.

50:44.085 --> 50:46.793
Come on. Please.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.651
I don't think so.

50:48.751 --> 50:52.776
Actually, grandma isn't a
flying swings kind of a person.

50:52.876 --> 50:58.297
It's okay. Dad let me go by myself last
year. And I was only 9. Now I'm 10.

50:58.398 --> 51:00.110
- Oh, you went by yourself?
- Yes.

51:00.210 --> 51:02.651
- Let's go to the flying swings.
- Are we going to do it?

51:02.751 --> 51:05.026
- Yes! By herself.
- Okay.

51:05.126 --> 51:06.818
Look at her.

51:06.918 --> 51:09.376
Hi!

51:11.293 --> 51:14.026
How come you never had kids.
I mean, you're a natural.

51:14.126 --> 51:16.110
You want the unabridged
version or the 'cliff notes'?

51:16.210 --> 51:18.943
Whatever you can get
through without crying.

51:19.043 --> 51:22.443
Well, Eugene and I we were
obviously struggling actors.

51:22.543 --> 51:25.610
And we took jobs wherever
there was any kind of work.

51:25.710 --> 51:27.443
And we kept telling ourselves that...

51:27.543 --> 51:30.985
we just needed time to get
our careers on solid footing.

51:31.085 --> 51:33.693
And then guess what, suddenly
I don't know what happened,

51:33.793 --> 51:35.401
we were 40 years old.

51:35.501 --> 51:38.793
- Grandma!
- Oh, hi!

51:39.501 --> 51:43.418
Anyway, that was around the
time I got pregnant and...

51:45.626 --> 51:48.568
Yeah, we didn't plan it,
it just kind of happened.

51:48.668 --> 51:50.401
But I remember being really scared

51:50.501 --> 51:53.735
because I couldn't
get it out of my mind

51:53.835 --> 51:55.901
how my parents used
to argue all the time,

51:56.001 --> 52:00.068
over how to raise me and my sister.

52:00.168 --> 52:02.501
And you know what the truth is?

52:03.751 --> 52:06.443
I didn't think I could
be a good mother.

52:06.543 --> 52:11.085
But I never got to
find out. After I...

52:13.085 --> 52:19.501
I lost the baby that part
of me kinda shut down.

52:19.626 --> 52:21.110
So...

52:21.210 --> 52:23.751
Oh, there she is, there...

52:26.126 --> 52:29.276
Well, for the record... I think
you would be a great mom.

52:29.376 --> 52:32.901
I thought I was a great dad.
But I think I just got dealt a bad kid.

52:33.001 --> 52:35.360
No such thing as a bad kid, Oren.

52:35.460 --> 52:38.818
Trust me, this kid was nothing
but grief from day one.

52:38.918 --> 52:42.276
Dropped outta school.
Quit all his team sports.

52:42.376 --> 52:46.443
The only thing he did
really well, is take drugs.

52:46.543 --> 52:50.460
- He didn't do anything right.
- No?

52:50.793 --> 52:53.668
He did one thing right.

52:59.126 --> 53:01.735
That was so much fun.

53:01.835 --> 53:06.276
- Thank you, Oren.
- You know you can call me grandpa.

53:06.376 --> 53:08.668
Okay.

53:11.418 --> 53:14.335
Will I ever see my mother again?

53:16.001 --> 53:19.443
Well, honey, if you
want to. Sure, yeah.

53:19.543 --> 53:21.360
I don't know.

53:21.460 --> 53:25.276
I think it's best if you hang out
with grandma and grandpa right now.

53:25.376 --> 53:29.210
At least until we break
your dad out of jail.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.318
- How do we do that?
- Yeah, how do we do that?

53:31.418 --> 53:37.418
- The usual way, lawyers, money, guns.
- Cool.

53:46.585 --> 53:50.151
- Can I stay with you tonight, grandpa?
- Well...

53:50.251 --> 53:53.735
- Yeah, he would love to.
- You didn't let me finish.

53:53.835 --> 53:56.651
Good. Can I have a bologna sandwich?

53:56.751 --> 54:00.401
Two slices of bologna, one slice
of cheese, butter, no mayo.

54:00.501 --> 54:02.793
You remembered.

54:41.460 --> 54:45.485
Thank you very much.
You've been a really lovely audience.

54:45.585 --> 54:50.901
I just wondered is there anybody
here tonight from New Jersey...

54:51.001 --> 54:52.818
Really? Really!

54:52.918 --> 54:54.276
You know, that's so interesting.

54:54.376 --> 54:57.401
Because my husband and I spent
an entire summer in Montclair...

54:57.501 --> 55:01.151
- Stay away from dead people.
- You scared the shit outta me!

55:01.251 --> 55:03.943
Well, at least I didn't
say that he died.

55:04.043 --> 55:07.360
But he did die. And you know he died.

55:07.460 --> 55:09.961
And the moment that thought
enters your head you start...

55:10.062 --> 55:14.526
- Okay, okay. Can we not talk about Eugene.
- I'm sorry I brought it up.

55:14.626 --> 55:17.943
I don't understand why I have
to talk in-between songs.

55:18.043 --> 55:21.026
- Because people want to get to know you.
- People don't really...

55:21.126 --> 55:24.301
And the more they know
you the more they like you.

55:24.402 --> 55:26.602
- You think?
- Absolutely.

55:26.703 --> 55:29.276
I like you. And I don't like anybody.

55:29.376 --> 55:32.651
Oh, I see. Is this one of
your backhanded compliments.

55:32.751 --> 55:34.838
Take it however you want.
I'm just stating a fact.

55:34.939 --> 55:38.743
- Yeah?
- And I love your songs.

55:39.543 --> 55:43.229
It wouldn't kill your act to throw
in a couple more recent ones.

55:43.330 --> 55:48.110
- Okay. Anything else?
- Well, since you bring it up.

55:48.210 --> 55:52.693
You're a very
attractive woman. But...

55:52.793 --> 55:56.868
some of your outfits they
just don't do you justice.

55:57.435 --> 56:03.710
Besides my song selection,
my patter and my physical appearance.

56:03.811 --> 56:06.318
- You like the act?
- I love it.

56:06.418 --> 56:10.603
I'm just getting eaten alive here.
Would you like to... I got an idea.

56:10.704 --> 56:13.685
- Why don't you come inside.
- Sure.

56:15.043 --> 56:16.318
Okay.

56:16.418 --> 56:19.443
You know, it doesn't always have
to be about you as part of a couple.

56:19.543 --> 56:22.151
- What?
- When you talk to the audience,

56:22.251 --> 56:25.212
you should talk about
yourself as an individual.

56:25.313 --> 56:29.135
Oh, God, yeah. As an individual.
I'm not that interesting.

56:29.235 --> 56:32.835
- You're interesting to me.
- Would you like something to drink?

56:33.376 --> 56:36.401
Thirst quenching type of drink

56:36.501 --> 56:41.008
- or a leading to something kind of drink?
- Would you like a glass of wine?

56:41.109 --> 56:42.860
- Sure.
- Okay.

56:42.960 --> 56:47.901
Honestly, I don't think an audience
wants to hear me talk about my life.

56:48.001 --> 56:50.443
Sure they would. Tell me
something about yourself

56:50.543 --> 56:52.735
that I would be surprised to hear.

56:52.835 --> 56:56.543
Okay, well, I used to collect
antique lipstick cases.

56:57.043 --> 56:59.110
- What else you got?
- See. I told you.

56:59.210 --> 57:03.068
I mean, tell me about
your first crush.

57:03.168 --> 57:06.735
No, wait. Are you asking me
as you, or are you asking me...

57:06.835 --> 57:11.485
- I'm just asking about your first crush.
- Okay, all right.

57:11.585 --> 57:13.985
You really want to hear it?

57:14.085 --> 57:16.985
Okay, I was in 7th grade and I was...

57:17.085 --> 57:19.693
at Amy Robinson's party

57:19.793 --> 57:24.235
and there was this boy,
Bobby Zaden who was a total jerk.

57:24.335 --> 57:27.485
But he asked me to dance.
And I don't know what happened.

57:27.585 --> 57:32.110
It was like a switch flipped
and then suddenly...

57:32.210 --> 57:35.443
I'm looking into these
gorgeous blue eyes...

57:35.543 --> 57:37.651
and we were dancing.

57:37.751 --> 57:42.543
And yeah, stepping on my feet
but I didn't care because...

57:43.126 --> 57:45.543
I was in love.

57:47.001 --> 57:48.735
- You see that...
- Yeah?

57:48.835 --> 57:54.960
You see that is really...
that is interesting.

57:59.501 --> 58:02.335
Are we really doing this?

58:02.501 --> 58:06.568
I thought I was but if
you don't want to...

58:06.668 --> 58:09.526
Well, no, it's not really that.
It's just...

58:09.626 --> 58:13.360
I mean, I don't...
it's been awhile for me.

58:13.460 --> 58:16.818
I know, it's been awhile for me too.

58:16.918 --> 58:19.526
Oh, is that because of your ACL?

58:19.626 --> 58:23.026
- Yeah, it was totally rehabbed I might add.
- That's good.

58:23.126 --> 58:25.026
I just think it's important
that we don't think of this

58:25.126 --> 58:30.668
- as anything more than what it is.
- Well, what is it?

58:31.543 --> 58:34.568
Well, we're both adults, we can
separate this from attachment.

58:34.668 --> 58:38.151
- Yeah, I don't know about that.
- Come on. Sure, we're animals.

58:38.251 --> 58:41.401
We are animals.
It's like a basic need.

58:41.501 --> 58:44.568
It's like water or food.
You know what I'm talking about.

58:44.668 --> 58:46.526
Are you... Whoa!

58:46.626 --> 58:49.801
Okay, of all the starts that
two people have every started,

58:49.901 --> 58:53.568
including teenagers and monkeys,
this is possibly the worst start,

58:53.668 --> 58:55.901
what I consider a potentially
intimate relationship.

58:56.001 --> 58:58.901
- Come on, it's not that bad, is it?
- Oh, really?

58:59.001 --> 59:02.901
I had a dog once,
that wouldn't leave my crotch alone

59:03.001 --> 59:05.735
and it was more romantic than this.

59:05.835 --> 59:07.901
It was way more romantic... oh, boy.

59:08.001 --> 59:09.710
It's...

59:20.001 --> 59:24.501
Better. Better. Yeah, okay.

59:31.126 --> 59:35.501
- You smell so good.
- I'm gonna leave my bra on.

59:42.335 --> 59:45.376
That was great.

59:54.085 --> 59:56.168
You got a great body.

01:00:07.543 --> 01:00:12.751
Listen, I should probably go,
Sarah's all alone over there.

01:00:21.293 --> 01:00:23.376
It was great.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:27.318
You were great, you know.

01:00:27.418 --> 01:00:32.626
I mean, the whole thing. It's great.

01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:35.001
Shit.

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:51.168
- Morning.
- If you say so.

01:00:51.835 --> 01:00:55.776
- You've been around Oren too much.
- Why you say that?

01:00:55.876 --> 01:01:01.043
- I don't know. You just seem...
- Yeah, I seem what? What do I seem?

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:06.059
- Nothing. Have a good day.
- I'm fine by the way, Kyle!

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.851
- Fine, thank you. Yeah.
- Okay. Sorry.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:18.068
- Beautiful day...
- Oh, my God! How dare you!

01:01:18.168 --> 01:01:20.318
I told you I had to
get back to Sarah.

01:01:20.418 --> 01:01:22.526
You told me 2 seconds
after we finished,

01:01:22.626 --> 01:01:26.115
- it was like an extension of your orgasm!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:29.401
You left me crying in the bathroom!
What were you thinking!

01:01:29.501 --> 01:01:31.610
I was thinking,
she's crying in the bathroom

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:35.901
- and I should probably leave.
- You're unbelievable!

01:01:36.001 --> 01:01:39.276
Do you know that was the first time
I've had sex in almost four years.

01:01:39.376 --> 01:01:43.360
Okay, I understand, I'm sorry.
I promise I'll do better the next time.

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:48.735
Are you nuts! First of all,
there's not going to be a next time!

01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:52.110
- There's a better chance of...
- Hi Grandma! Hi Grandpa!

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:56.276
- Grandma, are you okay?
- She's fine, sweetie.

01:01:56.376 --> 01:02:02.568
See your grandma and your grandpa
did an unfortunate thing last night...

01:02:02.668 --> 01:02:08.360
I mean the thing itself was not
unfortunate. But the aftermath...

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.901
- Jesus!
- Can I go down to the docks?

01:02:12.001 --> 01:02:15.668
Yes. Please go down and just
make sure we can see you.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.943
- Better chance than what?
- What?

01:02:18.043 --> 01:02:21.901
You were saying that there's a better
chance that something would happen

01:02:22.001 --> 01:02:24.194
than there is that you
and I would try...

01:02:24.295 --> 01:02:27.871
Unbelievable!
You got to be kidding me!

01:02:27.972 --> 01:02:33.735
- I'm just looking for clarification.
- I mean... wow! That's unbelievable.

01:02:36.376 --> 01:02:37.918
Little, you've got a visitor!

01:02:41.376 --> 01:02:42.751
Over there.

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.001
David Shaw.

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:03.610
- Who are you?
- I'm your lawyer.

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:06.610
I've been retained by your father...
to file an appeal to your sentence.

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:11.335
We're on solid ground here.
With any luck you'll be out in no time.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:20.168
Who leaves a empty donut box?

01:03:20.835 --> 01:03:24.668
You eat the last donut,
you throw the box away?

01:03:25.293 --> 01:03:27.318
It's just common courtesy.

01:03:27.418 --> 01:03:29.693
I think you're gardener stopped by.

01:03:29.793 --> 01:03:32.526
He looked hungry, so I
gave him the last one.

01:03:32.626 --> 01:03:36.251
He wants more money.
I'm trying to avoid him.

01:03:43.293 --> 01:03:47.376
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- What's the matter?

01:03:51.293 --> 01:03:55.401
I messed up. I need a
woman's perspective

01:03:55.501 --> 01:04:00.751
- and you're the closest thing too it.
- You always could charm me.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:04.693
- I slept with Leah.
- You did mess up.

01:04:04.793 --> 01:04:07.860
Well, the sex was
actually pretty good.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.318
- But you left immediately after, right?
- How'd you know that?

01:04:12.418 --> 01:04:15.318
You think you invented
men being assholes?

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.568
Well, what do I do?

01:04:17.668 --> 01:04:22.276
That depends. Are you looking to go
back to the way things were before?

01:04:22.376 --> 01:04:26.193
- No.
- Good. Because that's impossible.

01:04:26.293 --> 01:04:28.943
You have to understand,
she's very emotional.

01:04:29.043 --> 01:04:34.568
Give her some time,
let her calm down, then beg.

01:04:34.668 --> 01:04:38.360
Although why she would give
you a second chance...

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.651
Why does cancer kill good people?
And you're still alive.

01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:45.735
Careful. I'm the only friend you got.

01:04:45.835 --> 01:04:49.276
I might have found someone else
who likes me so you can die now.

01:04:49.376 --> 01:04:54.651
- Who in God's name would be that stupid.
- My granddaughter.

01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:57.235
- How do they know how to do this?
- It's nature.

01:04:57.335 --> 01:05:00.526
It's how baby turtles know
how to run into the ocean

01:05:00.626 --> 01:05:01.943
after they've been born.

01:05:02.043 --> 01:05:05.068
And I guess it's how bees
know how to make a hive.

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:08.360
- Nature's amazing.
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.733
- We should film it.
- That's such a great idea.

01:05:10.834 --> 01:05:13.405
Too bad we don't have a
camera though. What?

01:05:13.506 --> 01:05:15.542
- You do.
- Oh, no. I do, don't I?

01:05:15.643 --> 01:05:18.776
We can film a little
bit of it each day.

01:05:18.876 --> 01:05:22.151
Then we can download
it all to your computer.

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:25.985
Then we can get an editing app.
Then we can make a movie.

01:05:26.085 --> 01:05:30.526
- Do you really know how to do all this?
- No. But I can figure it out.

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:33.293
Nature's amazing.

01:05:34.043 --> 01:05:38.918
- What do you want?
- Grandpa, come in. We're making a movie.

01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:43.693
Oh, look at that.
Caterpillar's crawling on twigs.

01:05:43.793 --> 01:05:47.568
- That is some plot.
- It's a science project.

01:05:47.668 --> 01:05:51.026
- We're going to film the metamorphosis.
- That's terrific.

01:05:51.126 --> 01:05:55.818
- Is there a reason you're here?
- I got you an audition for a new job.

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:58.651
Paying 1500 a week.

01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:00.860
Look at this one.
He's already started his cocoon.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.235
Wait a second, so you
got me an audition

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:06.526
- without even telling me about it.
- I'm telling you now.

01:06:06.626 --> 01:06:09.110
I know, but you don't seem to
understand I have to get ready.

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.901
I gotta find an accompanist.
And I gotta pick a song.

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:15.526
- You better get a move on.
- Okay. I better make some calls.

01:06:15.626 --> 01:06:19.126
Sarah... Can I have the camera.
Thank you, thank you.

01:06:19.793 --> 01:06:23.526
I suppose this is your way
of smoothing things over?

01:06:23.626 --> 01:06:25.193
No, no. This isn't personal.

01:06:25.293 --> 01:06:27.943
This is strictly business.
Between you and your agent.

01:06:28.043 --> 01:06:31.735
Because on a personal level I
consider you a disgusting pig.

01:06:31.835 --> 01:06:34.360
Guess that's a step up
from being a asshole.

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:38.710
Artie. It's Leah. Yes,
well, I need a big favor.

01:06:40.168 --> 01:06:44.651
Is there any particular song or
style you would like, because...

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:48.360
- Whatever works for you.
- Okay, all right.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.517
- Artie?
- Two bar intro.

01:06:50.618 --> 01:06:52.960
- Two bar.
- Okay. Here we go.

01:06:57.762 --> 01:07:01.901
<i>People are talking,
talking 'bout people</i>

01:07:02.001 --> 01:07:06.526
The way you described her. I expected
someone considerably younger.

01:07:06.626 --> 01:07:09.818
Well, what she lacks in curb appeal.

01:07:09.918 --> 01:07:13.693
She makes up for in historic charm.

01:07:13.793 --> 01:07:16.668
She slept with Elvis.

01:07:17.168 --> 01:07:19.251
Really?

01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:23.235
<i>We stand just a little too close</i>

01:07:23.335 --> 01:07:28.168
Nice voice. But a little soft.

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.026
What do you say 1250
a week and we got a deal.

01:07:31.126 --> 01:07:33.318
Enjoy the rest of the song

01:07:33.418 --> 01:07:36.985
because this is the last time
you're going to hear it.

01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:41.543
- You're busting my balls.
- We had a deal for 1500.

01:07:42.961 --> 01:07:46.227
<i>Let's give them
something to talk about</i>

01:07:46.327 --> 01:07:51.427
<i>How about love, love, love?</i>

01:07:52.543 --> 01:07:55.335
Could she start Thursday?

01:07:58.251 --> 01:08:00.901
You were great!
You were great! Oh, my God!

01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:05.901
That run you had in the second chorus
was just, as the kids say, cra'!

01:08:06.001 --> 01:08:09.985
- No, no. What does 'cra' mean?
- Crazy. Crazy, oh.

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:13.043
Okay, I'm going to go with that.

01:08:13.501 --> 01:08:16.276
- And thank you so much.
- I had a great time.

01:08:16.376 --> 01:08:18.401
- I had fun.
- What you did for me.

01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:20.943
Artie, you are truly a stand up guy.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:25.126
Okay, I owe you. Hey,
get yourself a new toupe it's on me.

01:08:25.751 --> 01:08:30.417
Artie. Thanks again. Oh, God, thanks.

01:08:31.626 --> 01:08:34.234
I just want to say one thing to you.

01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:36.651
Thank you for getting
me this audition.

01:08:36.751 --> 01:08:39.568
- It means a lot to me.
- Come on, it was your talent.

01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:43.609
You know, Oren. You can be
surprisingly decent at times.

01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:49.960
Yeah, you know. I was thinking
about that night and...

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.276
And I agree it was really
unfortunate for the evening...

01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:59.026
to end that way and I
take full responsibility.

01:08:59.126 --> 01:09:03.335
- Good, because it was your fault.
- Didn't I just say that?

01:09:04.292 --> 01:09:10.359
And I was wondering if there was some,
you know, pathway to a do-over.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.276
- A do-over?
- Even teenagers and monkeys

01:09:13.376 --> 01:09:16.760
- get a second chance.
- To what end?

01:09:17.385 --> 01:09:20.318
- Well, you know, I just thought...
- You thought what?

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:23.526
You thought that we could...
what do the kids call it?

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:25.626
We could have a... hook up?

01:09:25.727 --> 01:09:27.901
- Is that what you thought?
- No. No, no.

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:33.151
Look, Oren, I don't do casual sex.
No, I never could.

01:09:33.251 --> 01:09:35.859
Even way back. Back in the day.
Way back in Woodstock

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.776
and everybody was talking about
free love, how cool, how groovy...

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:44.085
But I couldn't do it.
Even then I knew that...

01:09:45.585 --> 01:09:48.710
Love always comes with a price.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:54.860
Well, perhaps the choice of the
word do-over was ill advised.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.985
Yeah. Look.

01:09:58.085 --> 01:10:02.651
Why don't we take this conversation
as you trying to get into

01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:06.610
my good graces and me being
only too happy to let that happen.

01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:10.471
Okay, less than I hoped for,
more than I expected.

01:10:10.572 --> 01:10:12.685
Okay. All right.

01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:22.610
- You ready for the big move?
- I guess so.

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:25.818
- I'm going to miss you, grandma.
- I'm going to miss you.

01:10:25.918 --> 01:10:27.443
She's not joining the Army,

01:10:27.543 --> 01:10:29.485
you're going to be 20 feet
away from each other.

01:10:29.585 --> 01:10:31.193
I know, but it's not the same.

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:34.693
I love having Sarah here and I'm
going to miss watching her sleep.

01:10:34.793 --> 01:10:37.276
You can come next door and
watch her sleep all you want.

01:10:37.376 --> 01:10:41.568
- You watch me sleep?
- Yeah, because you are a wonder, that's why.

01:10:41.668 --> 01:10:43.279
And maybe when I'm not working

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.318
- we can spend the night together.
- Yeah. I love cuddling.

01:10:46.418 --> 01:10:49.776
I hate to break up this love
fest here, but you and I,

01:10:49.876 --> 01:10:52.693
- we got business to discuss.
- Bye bye.

01:10:52.793 --> 01:10:55.735
- Now, what is your favorite color?
- What?

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.901
For your room,
the painters are coming...

01:10:58.001 --> 01:11:01.651
- You can pick any color you want.
- Purple.

01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:06.793
No, that's no good.
What's your next favorite color?

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.251
- Pink?
- Pink.

01:11:09.835 --> 01:11:13.710
Pink is too...
You know it's just too pink.

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:18.751
- Yellow?
- Yellow reminds me of puke, you know.

01:11:19.168 --> 01:11:22.918
Wait a minute, I got an idea.

01:11:26.543 --> 01:11:29.001
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.751
It's perfect!

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:41.901
- I love you, grandpa!
- I love you, sweetheart.

01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:46.026
Did Oren tell you that he hired a
lawyer to appeal Luke's sentence?

01:11:46.126 --> 01:11:49.901
- It doesn't surprise me.
- It surprised Luke.

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:53.901
I stopped by to see him yesterday.
He hadn't even talked to his dad.

01:11:54.001 --> 01:11:59.735
That doesn't surprise me either.
Oren is different from you and me.

01:11:59.835 --> 01:12:03.318
Well, from me Grandma.
Two of you are peas in a pod.

01:12:03.418 --> 01:12:05.568
Blow me.

01:12:05.668 --> 01:12:08.501
I love you like family.

01:12:12.668 --> 01:12:16.357
Mow his lawn and leave
him the hell alone.

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:17.901
Oh, my God...

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:21.651
- He's stalking Oren for a shakedown.
- Is Mr. Little here?

01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:25.518
- Mario Reyes?
- Yes. This is my wife Selena.

01:12:25.619 --> 01:12:27.085
Hi.

01:12:27.251 --> 01:12:31.610
This is Mario Reyes. He won
the Cy Young last year.

01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:33.193
We just got him as a free
agent from the Rangers.

01:12:33.293 --> 01:12:35.626
So he's not a gardener?

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.401
He just signed a 175 million
dollar contract with the Mets.

01:12:40.501 --> 01:12:43.793
Would you like another donut?

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.751
What are you doing here? How'd you
get out? Come on, get in here.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.318
Come on, Paint.

01:13:03.418 --> 01:13:06.693
Come on. Come on. Good boy. Good boy.

01:13:06.793 --> 01:13:11.210
Yeah, good boy. All right.

01:13:19.335 --> 01:13:23.001
Jesus, I leave it for half an hour...

01:13:29.626 --> 01:13:33.751
Sarah! You left the
slip and slide on!

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:37.499
What the hell?

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.576
Kennedy's having her baby.
Hurry, she needs help.

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:47.443
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God!

01:13:47.543 --> 01:13:49.943
- What are you doing?
- Having my baby!

01:13:50.043 --> 01:13:52.818
- No, you can't do that!
- Well, it's not up to me!

01:13:52.918 --> 01:13:55.110
- Sarah, please call 911!
- I called 911.

01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:57.318
Why couldn't you do
this in your apartment?

01:13:57.418 --> 01:13:59.501
I couldn't make it up the stairs!

01:14:01.085 --> 01:14:05.068
- Leah! Get in here God damn it!
- She went shopping.

01:14:05.168 --> 01:14:07.710
She went shopping?

01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:12.568
See, this is what happens
when you have sex.

01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:17.185
- No, no, no, no. No pushing.
- I need to push! I have to push.

01:14:17.285 --> 01:14:19.818
Sarah, please, just go
into the purple room.

01:14:19.918 --> 01:14:24.460
- Oren! Do something!
- Okay!

01:14:25.585 --> 01:14:27.876
I'm going to wash up!

01:14:28.251 --> 01:14:30.776
Oren! Oren!

01:14:30.876 --> 01:14:35.293
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Just keep it in there.

01:14:36.543 --> 01:14:39.235
Just keep it in there!

01:14:39.335 --> 01:14:42.585
Okay, I'm coming!

01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:49.193
All right, okay! I'm going
to lift up your dress now.

01:14:49.293 --> 01:14:51.751
I want a epidermal!

01:14:52.793 --> 01:14:54.651
- You've got underpants on.
- Take 'em off!

01:14:54.751 --> 01:14:56.776
- I'm not going to look.
- Just look!

01:14:56.876 --> 01:14:58.610
- No, no.
- I want you to look.

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:02.460
- I won't look.
- I've got a baby that needs you to look!

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:07.151
Okay, I'm looking.

01:15:07.251 --> 01:15:08.985
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:15:09.085 --> 01:15:12.235
There's a head in your vagina!

01:15:12.335 --> 01:15:14.401
- Oh, my God!
- Get it out of there!

01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:17.193
Get it out of there. Oh, my God!

01:15:17.293 --> 01:15:20.901
Oh, thank God, get over here!
Get over, there's a baby!

01:15:21.001 --> 01:15:23.276
I can't do this! I need
you to help me out!

01:15:23.376 --> 01:15:26.193
You're fine, you're fine, Oren.

01:15:26.293 --> 01:15:29.110
- You gotta do it.
- I'll take over...

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:32.526
- No, Oren, don't leave!
- Okay! I'm not leaving.

01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:35.610
Cradle the head.

01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:40.626
Now listen to me Kennedy!
One more push!

01:15:42.085 --> 01:15:44.168
Go on, push!

01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:50.126
It's a boy!

01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:53.318
Look at that... That wasn't so bad!

01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:55.235
- He's not breathing.
- What?

01:15:55.335 --> 01:15:58.276
Oren... He's not crying.
Oren, make him cry!

01:15:58.376 --> 01:16:01.943
Pat him on the back.

01:16:02.043 --> 01:16:04.376
- Pat him harder, Oren.
- Breathe!

01:16:12.376 --> 01:16:15.951
I can make anybody cry.

01:16:16.626 --> 01:16:18.618
You want this?

01:16:22.835 --> 01:16:26.276
- You did it... Thank you, Oren.
- No problem.

01:16:26.376 --> 01:16:30.276
Sarah, come out.
He's perfect in every way.

01:16:30.376 --> 01:16:34.068
- It's so little.
- He didn't feel little.

01:16:34.168 --> 01:16:37.501
- Baby, I'm here! Kennedy!
- Ray!

01:16:40.918 --> 01:16:44.943
It's a boy! Oren delivered him.

01:16:45.043 --> 01:16:48.443
I think he was coming out on his own.
I just more or less caught him.

01:16:48.543 --> 01:16:50.401
Thanks, Oren.

01:16:50.501 --> 01:16:53.026
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:16:53.126 --> 01:16:56.460
We can help with the umbilical cord.

01:16:58.835 --> 01:17:01.126
Oren Little, speak.

01:17:01.626 --> 01:17:04.443
Hi Claire. Nothing.

01:17:04.543 --> 01:17:07.693
Just facilitating
the miracle of life.

01:17:07.793 --> 01:17:10.085
How about you?

01:17:20.793 --> 01:17:23.085
Are you okay?

01:17:23.418 --> 01:17:26.210
I just sold my house.

01:17:46.418 --> 01:17:48.401
Grandpa?

01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:52.626
Grandma's going to work.
She looks sad.

01:18:03.668 --> 01:18:05.960
Leah!

01:18:07.126 --> 01:18:09.668
I like the new look.

01:18:11.543 --> 01:18:13.835
Thank you.

01:18:19.626 --> 01:18:21.918
Come on, sweetie.

01:19:20.501 --> 01:19:22.710
Thank you so much.

01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:30.543
How'd it go tonight?

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:33.901
It went fine.

01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:36.068
Did you do the Bonnie Raitt song?

01:19:36.168 --> 01:19:40.001
Yeah, I did. I did the
Bonnie Raitt song.

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.901
When are you leaving?

01:19:45.001 --> 01:19:48.751
As soon as Luke gets out.
Day after tomorrow.

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:54.276
- Where will you go.
- I got a place up in Vermont.

01:19:54.376 --> 01:19:59.501
Sarah Beth and I we
talked about retiring there.

01:19:59.835 --> 01:20:02.168
That sounds really nice.

01:20:02.376 --> 01:20:04.960
Yes. It is quiet.

01:20:11.668 --> 01:20:14.360
This all worked out good.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.276
- Good.
- You don't need an agent anymore.

01:20:17.376 --> 01:20:19.668
No.

01:20:19.876 --> 01:20:21.651
Sarah gets her father back.

01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:26.168
We all get to stay here
in Little Shangri-La.

01:20:29.085 --> 01:20:31.376
I'm gonna miss you.

01:20:36.001 --> 01:20:39.001
I'll miss you too, Leah.

01:20:42.043 --> 01:20:46.376
Well, I guess I gotta go back inside.

01:20:58.876 --> 01:21:03.610
Are you sure you don't want to
use some financing? Mortgage?

01:21:03.710 --> 01:21:06.943
Interest rates on super-jumbos
these days are great.

01:21:07.043 --> 01:21:10.401
We just want to own this house.

01:21:10.501 --> 01:21:13.418
Cash is okay?

01:21:14.168 --> 01:21:17.126
Cash is fine, yes.

01:21:17.793 --> 01:21:19.818
How old are your kids?

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:25.110
Roberto is 2. Maria, 5.
J.J., 7 and Victor almost 9.

01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:28.443
My Luke was 3 when we moved here.

01:21:28.543 --> 01:21:30.960
And how many years ago is that?

01:21:32.085 --> 01:21:35.943
- Thirty-two.
- Our children will love it here, Oren.

01:21:36.043 --> 01:21:38.751
We will love your home for you.

01:21:41.751 --> 01:21:44.293
We're nearly done here.

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:51.418
You will always be welcomed back.

01:21:55.126 --> 01:21:59.610
The next song has a very
special meaning to me.

01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:02.276
When I was 17 and...

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.901
I love this song.

01:22:05.001 --> 01:22:07.068
It was playing...

01:22:07.168 --> 01:22:10.901
when I realized I was in
love first time in my life.

01:22:11.001 --> 01:22:13.901
I was really in love.

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:17.235
And you know how powerful
that first love is,

01:22:17.335 --> 01:22:22.960
you just think you're never going to
have those feelings for anybody else.

01:22:28.793 --> 01:22:31.085
For the road.

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:38.710
44 years, Claire.
You look exactly the same.

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:47.485
You know, I once heard
someone say that every hello

01:22:47.585 --> 01:22:50.068
is just a goodbye waiting to happen.

01:22:50.168 --> 01:22:54.610
See, it's shit like that,
that makes people sound stupid.

01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:57.318
Good luck, Oren.

01:22:57.418 --> 01:23:02.835
But sometimes... life outlives love.

01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:08.485
I never thought that I'd
ever fall in love again.

01:23:08.585 --> 01:23:12.360
But here I am,
what's the matter right?

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.751
I'm still...

01:23:15.585 --> 01:23:18.568
singing this song...

01:23:18.668 --> 01:23:21.710
and still dreaming...

01:23:22.251 --> 01:23:24.585
of love.

01:23:26.761 --> 01:23:32.560
<i>The shadow of your smile</i>

01:23:33.361 --> 01:23:39.229
<i>When you are gone</i>

01:23:41.627 --> 01:23:46.325
<i>Will color all my dreams</i>

01:23:46.926 --> 01:23:52.662
<i>And light the dawn</i>

01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:00.159
<i>Look into my eyes</i>

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:06.564
<i>And you will see</i>

01:24:09.561 --> 01:24:13.653
<i>All the lovely things</i>

01:24:13.753 --> 01:24:18.985
<i>You are to me</i>

01:24:19.085 --> 01:24:21.718
Why'd you do all this?

01:24:22.668 --> 01:24:25.361
You're my son.

01:24:25.461 --> 01:24:30.092
<i>Our wistful little star</i>

01:24:30.493 --> 01:24:36.826
<i>Was far too high</i>

01:24:38.827 --> 01:24:43.326
<i>A teardrop kissed your lips</i>

01:24:44.327 --> 01:24:50.959
<i>And so did I</i>

01:24:53.001 --> 01:24:55.543
Daddy!

01:24:58.661 --> 01:25:03.093
<i>Remember spring</i>

01:25:05.094 --> 01:25:12.026
<i>And all the joy that love can bring</i>

01:25:12.126 --> 01:25:17.127
Hey, S.B. I just wanted
to say good-bye.

01:25:17.227 --> 01:25:20.894
<i>I will be</i>

01:25:20.994 --> 01:25:26.560
<i>Remembering</i>

01:25:29.561 --> 01:25:33.328
<i>The shadow</i>

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:35.628
<i>Of</i>

01:25:36.426 --> 01:25:42.360
<i>Your smile</i>

01:25:54.918 --> 01:25:57.793
Every time. Thank you.

01:26:10.085 --> 01:26:12.360
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:15.860
So I notice the crying has
got back into the act.

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.293
Well, at least I almost
got through the song.

01:26:29.293 --> 01:26:32.543
I thought you were going to
leave without saying goodbye.

01:26:33.376 --> 01:26:38.126
Well, I did try,
but it didn't feel right.

01:26:38.543 --> 01:26:43.318
- How human you're becoming, Oren.
- Not as human as you might think.

01:26:43.418 --> 01:26:46.193
I had no problem with the
not saying good-bye part.

01:26:46.293 --> 01:26:50.276
You know, but a few
miles outside of town...

01:26:50.376 --> 01:26:56.085
I discovered that I had a big
problem with the leaving part.

01:26:57.001 --> 01:27:01.710
- Why might that be?
- I think you got some idea.

01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:07.876
If it's what I think it is,
you're gonna have to say it.

01:27:16.793 --> 01:27:20.835
I couldn't live next
door to you as a friend.

01:27:23.001 --> 01:27:25.068
I don't want to be your friend.

01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:29.543
I don't want to be
in your good graces.

01:27:31.751 --> 01:27:34.626
I want to be with you.

01:27:51.418 --> 01:27:56.793
- Would you like a ride home?
- Yes.

01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:12.318
Of course you know if we do this
you have to spend the whole night.

01:28:12.418 --> 01:28:16.460
- Really?
- Every night.

01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:20.543
Oh geez, I should have thought
this whole thing through.

01:28:24.918 --> 01:28:28.610
How do caterpillar's just
know how to make a cocoon?

01:28:28.710 --> 01:28:33.068
- It's called nature.
- Oh, I love the music.

01:28:33.168 --> 01:28:35.151
- It was Dad's idea.
- He's very talented.

01:28:35.251 --> 01:28:38.960
- How would you know?
- That's what I heard.

01:28:39.251 --> 01:28:42.568
- Look at that.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:28:42.668 --> 01:28:44.110
How'd you do that?

01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:47.651
There's an App that creates
time lapse photography.

01:28:47.751 --> 01:28:50.875
- I'm sure there is.
- Oren, look, look.

01:28:50.876 --> 01:28:55.043
Look, Oren, it's a butterfly!
