My client recognizes the deep attachment
that your client has to his Mercedes

01:16.493 --> 01:18.036
and will not contest it.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.079

01:19.162 --> 01:22.123
-She will retain the Buick Enclave.
-We don't have a problem with that.

-Excellent.

keep in mind that you aren't worth
the skin God spent to wrap your bones in.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.482
You best pray
he doesn't regret his investment in you

01:47.565 --> 01:48.942
as much as I regret mine.

-Helen, I'm sorry.
-Oh, don't you dare apologize.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.429
That was the most magnificent thing
I've seen you do

02:18.513 --> 02:20.140
since you ate that lizard in kindergarten.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.224

-But you will persevere.
-Yeah.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.155
What, so Bill gets to buy mistress Noreen
a new house?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.699
The kids and I just have to move
and start over?

02:37.782 --> 02:39.409
-No, you won't have to do that.
-[sighs]

02:41.119 --> 02:43.997
Helen, I swear sometimes I think
it would be a blessing

02:44.080 --> 02:47.208
to live in a place that...
nobody knew what happened.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.044
But the kids would have to find
a new school...

02:50.837 --> 02:53.840

and Dana Sue and I just...

02:54.632 --> 02:55.842

02:56.843 --> 02:59.262
How in the devil did I get to this place?

[sighs]

03:01.931 --> 03:03.057
Maddie, I got you.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.896
But Tom came on strong
because that's his job.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.275
I am gonna beat him down
because that's my job.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.862
I'm gonna get you everything you deserve
and then some.

03:17.030 --> 03:17.947
[sniffles]

03:19.824 --> 03:21.701
I'm still researching the legal precedent

03:21.784 --> 03:23.620
for getting Bill's head
on a silver platter.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.954
[both chuckle]

03:25.038 --> 03:27.040
It wasn't his head
that caused the problem.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.251

Seriously. First a baseball star
and now a theater star.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.860
Am I even worthy to walk to school
with the two of you?

03:55.944 --> 03:58.196
I'm just playing Puck.
It's not even the lead.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.573

and you're only a freshman.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.089
-[boys] The restaurant.
-[girl] The restaurant.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.757
[boy 2] Don't worry. You can sit with us.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.717
[boy 1] So what does Puck even do?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.010
He solves everything.

-[girl] Okay.

-Exactly.
-All right, I'll catch y'all.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.397
So, Annie,
you had Mrs. Kelsey last year, right?

04:32.939 --> 04:35.692
-Yeah.
-Any tips on conquering <i>The Odyssey?</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:38.278
Actually read it.
She'll know if you're faking.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.904
-Okay.
-I'll see you later.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.709
Ah! You're early! Okay, you know what?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.837
That is fine because I am ready to go.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.006
All right, new cocktail.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.009
I started with rye
to wish you a smooth finish,

05:01.092 --> 05:03.511
added some bitters
'cause you have every right to be.

05:03.594 --> 05:07.265
Then champagne
because this is truly a celebration

05:07.348 --> 05:09.684
and finished with <i>crème de pêche.</i>

05:09.767 --> 05:12.061
Because your future is gonna be peachy.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.731
Calling it Maddie's Moment.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.607
There is nothing to celebrate.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.570
Wait, what're you two up to?

05:21.154 --> 05:24.032
Darlin', we are all about being here
with you, for you.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.159
No, no, no. No. There's something else.
I can smell it.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.995
And you two should know better than anyone
that I have lost my tolerance

05:29.078 --> 05:31.706
-for people keeping secrets from me.
-Okay, you know what?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.833
Let's forget celebrating, all right?

05:34.208 --> 05:40.423
Let's think of these
more as a statement of intent. Okay?

05:41.382 --> 05:42.258
Helen?

05:44.218 --> 05:45.762
Press on. Okay?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.350
Maddie, nobody's gonna make you drink,
but at least sit down.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.518
-Come on. Take a moment or two--
-No, no, no. I cannot.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.314
I cannot because if I relax,
I'm gonna lose it.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.232
I swear to God, some days I just...

05:58.316 --> 06:01.736
I wake up, and I have nothing but hate

06:02.445 --> 06:04.489
for Bill and Noreen
pumping through my veins.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.491
I have to get a new job.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.332

06:15.041 --> 06:17.960
-Precisely why you need new inspiration.
-Dana Sue,

06:18.044 --> 06:20.797
-now's not the time. It's not the time.
-Why isn't--

06:20.880 --> 06:23.925
-Tell me. Tell me right this minute.
-Tell her.

06:26.969 --> 06:27.845
Maddie...

06:29.055 --> 06:32.183
you know how Ms. Frances for a while now
has been talking about downsizing?

06:32.266 --> 06:35.186
-Yeah.
-Well, I thought it was a lovely idea,

06:35.269 --> 06:37.063
but it also broke my heart a little

06:37.146 --> 06:39.482
to think of that house
just sitting there all empty.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.527
So, I, uh...

06:43.653 --> 06:46.614

that big, beautiful house of hers.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.131
We three are gonna turn
that big, old house

07:03.214 --> 07:09.637
into a fluffy, glorious, indulgent spa.

and you'll be the manager.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.479

07:18.563 --> 07:20.398
that I would be able to start
something new,

07:20.481 --> 07:23.192
something this huge,
in the midst of all of this chaos?

than she was prepared for.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.922

to regain her bearings, that's all.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.176
Well, I can empathize.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.637
I thought I would lose my mind
after I threw Ronnie out.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.931
But I at least let you two help me.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.435

to talk Maddie down. [laughs]

I'm hearing?

12:32.001 --> 12:33.753
[chuckles] Um...

12:33.836 --> 12:36.422
Ty and Jackson Lewis were at each other
during practice.

12:36.505 --> 12:40.217
I made 'em both run laps,
and Ty will be along... momentarily.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.344
Merciful heaven, why is it always Jackson?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.972
Those two have been grappling
since the sandbox.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.933
I thought I got a whiff
of a longstanding rivalry.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.810
Yeah, well, still, that is no excuse

12:49.894 --> 12:52.271
for Ty having a part
in disrupting your practice.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.230
I'm sorry.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.736
I-- I keep telling him that it's an honor
to be coached by a professional player.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.905
[chuckles] Former professional player.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.490
Well, still.

13:04.950 --> 13:05.826
Well, thank you.

13:08.871 --> 13:13.459
Uh, but I do wanna say that Ty has been
a little... hair-trigger lately...

13:14.084 --> 13:14.960
um...

13:15.044 --> 13:17.463
and I don't mean to overstep,
but are there any issues

13:17.546 --> 13:18.547
I should know about?

13:19.882 --> 13:20.800
Well, um...

13:21.842 --> 13:25.095
Yeah, he's...
he's hit a bit of a rough patch.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.097
Ah. Junior year's a beast.

13:27.181 --> 13:30.100
It certainly is.
And he's hard on himself, and...

13:31.143 --> 13:32.728
I'm going to take him home now.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.064
-As you should.
-Thank you.

13:35.147 --> 13:35.981
Anytime.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.531
[car engine starting]

13:44.323 --> 13:46.659
-[man indistinct]
-[woman] I got it.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.037
[Dana Sue] Explain this, please.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.540
Simon Spry wrote that, not me.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.667
I am talking about the picture,

13:55.125 --> 13:57.169
which was taken from the roof
of this restaurant

13:57.253 --> 13:58.712
in the middle of the night

13:58.796 --> 14:00.798
by a girl who could only
have gotten up there

14:00.881 --> 14:03.342
if she took my keys without my permission.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.303
-I don't know.
-Remember how I feel about lying?

14:10.057 --> 14:13.018
Okay, I took a risk,
but art requires risk.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.521
I'm just as committed to my art
as you are to yours.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.564
Okay.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.774
And by "art,"

14:18.858 --> 14:21.360
you mean this Instagram account
called Welcome to Serenity?

14:22.403 --> 14:26.198
Okay, your friend Simon says,
"It presents a look at the real Serenity."

14:26.282 --> 14:30.411
So I thought I would take a look
at my daughter's opinion of her hometown.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.497
And this Instagram account

14:33.581 --> 14:36.458
is filled with pictures of possums

14:36.542 --> 14:39.253
and broken windows and sick trees.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.214
Is that truly how you see us?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.884
Everyone in this town
pretends to be so perfect,

14:44.967 --> 14:48.596
always sweet, smiling, serene,

14:48.679 --> 14:49.805
and then when your life blows up,

14:49.889 --> 14:52.391
you're supposed to just pretend
like everything's still all good?

14:52.474 --> 14:54.268
All fine, all bright and shiny and--

14:54.351 --> 14:56.729
Okay, so because
of what happened with your dad,

14:57.271 --> 14:59.023
you are gonna mock this whole town,

14:59.106 --> 15:01.775
which is filled with good people

15:01.859 --> 15:03.986
just doing their best
to get through the day.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.654
This isn't about Dad.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.700
You know,
why are we even having this conversation?

15:09.783 --> 15:11.869
You don't get me. Or my art.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.746
I have something to say.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.082
Well, you find another way to say it.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.252
And don't you ever take my keys again.

15:21.712 --> 15:22.546
Go.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.175
[man] Yeah, put that on the side.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.469
Chef, thank you for joining us.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.762
What do you need, Brad?

15:30.304 --> 15:33.182
Let us discuss the dissolute life
this catfish led.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.767
Overlook his sins and fry him.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.269
Folks are coming to eat him,
not befriend him.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.270
I wanted to poach him.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.065
Well, we all want things we can't have.
All right, listen up, y'all.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.567
We have a problem.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.322
Several bottles
of very expensive liquor are missing.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.490
[Brad] Disappointing.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.118
These things don't happen
in a well-run kitchen, people.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.703
How are we gonna handle this?

15:56.246 --> 15:59.333
If the bottles are returned
by end of day tomorrow,

15:59.416 --> 16:03.712
I absolve you. If they aren't,
there will be hell to pay. That simple.

16:04.922 --> 16:05.965
Any questions?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.508
-[employees] No, chef.
-Thank you.

16:07.591 --> 16:08.592
Back to work, everyone.

16:09.843 --> 16:13.097
Erik's right. Let's get ready
to make some hungry people happy.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.983
Hey, can you go upstairs
and make sure Katie brushed her teeth?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.317
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.366
Thanks for dinner, Mom.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.952
Yeah, I'm glad you liked it.
You were pretty quiet.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.913
Can't get a word in
once Katie gets going on<i> Trollhunters.</i>

16:37.997 --> 16:40.833
I thought it was because you didn't want
to tell me the details of your practice.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.668
Told you on the way home.
Practice was fine.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.628
-Tyler.
-Mother.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.214
Coach Maddox told me there was a problem.

16:47.756 --> 16:48.674
[sighs]

16:48.966 --> 16:49.883
That's great.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.969
Thought maybe you'd wanna fess up.

16:52.052 --> 16:52.970
Tell me the details.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.015
[scoffs] Okay. Okay, Jacks is a jerk.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.392
Coach is a hardass, and I ran laps.
Is that enough detail?

16:58.475 --> 17:00.310
-Watch your tone.
-Can I watch it in my room?

17:00.394 --> 17:02.813
Tyler, I've had myself a day,

17:02.896 --> 17:05.232
and the last thing I need
is disrespect from you to ice the cake.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.859
-Yeah, but--
-Go upstairs

17:06.942 --> 17:09.403
before you say something
that I will make you regret.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.156
[softly] Okay.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.953
[sighs]

17:22.583 --> 17:23.667
[light switch clicks]

17:33.510 --> 17:34.344
Whoa.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.888
God, I-- I thought you'd gone!

17:36.388 --> 17:38.057
Inspiration struck.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.558
I want to experiment.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.519
Uh, not at this hour.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.605
This is when I do my best cooking.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.274
Well, that's supposed to be
when you're on the clock.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.358
[laughs]

17:48.442 --> 17:50.235
-[Dana Sue chuckles]
-Eh, you know,

17:50.611 --> 17:54.323
you squelch my creativity
because you're jealous.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.951
Have you been drinking?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.414
I'm not on your stupid clock.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.500
You're in my kitchen.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.461
And there's no drinking
in my kitchen. Ever.

18:08.962 --> 18:09.963
What...

18:10.047 --> 18:10.881
[sniffing]

18:10.964 --> 18:13.550
-Oh, you like my cologne?
-Oh my God, that's whiskey!

18:13.634 --> 18:16.595
That is old, expensive whiskey!

18:16.678 --> 18:18.555
You thief!

18:19.264 --> 18:21.016
You know, everything that you have

18:21.558 --> 18:22.559
is because of me.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.646
Everything I have, I worked for.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.731
And sacrificed for

18:27.815 --> 18:29.650
without talking down to my staff

18:29.733 --> 18:34.154
or pretending that
my talent excuses bad behavior.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.493
You know the reason
female chefs rarely succeed?

18:39.576 --> 18:41.203
You can't take criticism.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.542
Goodbye, Brad.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.043
[chortles] Oh, come on!

18:49.461 --> 18:50.671
Ah, don't be a buzzkill.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.423
We got this beautiful piece of meat
to play with.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.175
-We got all night.
-You're fired.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.344
[chortles] No, I'm not.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.345
Well,

18:58.846 --> 19:01.473
I don't think
I could use any smaller words.

19:02.015 --> 19:02.891
Go.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.191
-No, come on.
-Don't touch me!

19:12.526 --> 19:13.360
Get out.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.613
Get out.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.243
[bag slams table]

19:21.952 --> 19:24.288
Get your things and get out of here!

19:31.044 --> 19:32.421
And leave your key.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.627
[Katie] No, you're not Daddy.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.965
-Noreen.
-Bill got called into the office.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.551
There's this nasty bug going around,

20:19.635 --> 20:22.221
and we just got flooded
with emergency walk-ins.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.889
So I'm here to pick them up.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.686
Okay, I'm not going.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.023
Oh, no, your dad doesn't have to work
the whole day.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.692
He's just running late,
and he didn't want y'all to have to wait.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.194
It's your dad's day.

20:37.277 --> 20:40.072
Yeah, well, I don't have the bug
so I don't need to see him.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.032
I'm staying with Ty.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.243
[retreating footsteps]

20:47.537 --> 20:49.873
I'm not gonna force my children
to go with you.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.709
Bill will be so disappointed.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.171
Yeah, well, Bill should be here.

21:00.050 --> 21:00.926
I'll go.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.356
So, how's school?

21:15.023 --> 21:15.857
Great.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.070
I'm in the spring play.
I'm Puck in <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

21:20.737 --> 21:21.989
I don't know that one.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.449
Shakespeare?

21:24.533 --> 21:25.742
I've only seen one play.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.078
It was beautiful.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.162
It was called <i>Cats.</i>

21:29.955 --> 21:31.581
Yeah, but that's a musical.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.458
It's not real theater.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.960
But your play is?

21:35.752 --> 21:37.254
Doesn't get much more classic.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.464
Tell me more.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.049
[chuckles]

21:46.805 --> 21:47.806
[door closes]

21:48.140 --> 21:49.224
[Helen] Hey, girl.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.475
Hey, morning.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.063
You know, Erik's at the Farmer's Market
hunting strawberries for shortcake

21:55.147 --> 21:57.232
and you are way too early for croissants.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.275
[chuckles]

21:58.358 --> 22:01.111
I'm on my way to the office
for a little quiet work time,

22:01.194 --> 22:02.946
and I thought I'd pop in
and say good morning.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.072
Well, good morning.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.073
Hmm.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.742
You alone?

22:07.617 --> 22:09.578
Yeah, had to get a jump on things.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.704
Short-handed.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.456
I fired Brad.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.498
I see.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.417
He was drinking.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.086
-You have a rule.
-And he stole from me.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.504
Oh, he broke the law.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.672
And he lied to me.

22:21.423 --> 22:25.177
And I will not have a man who lies
in this kitchen or in my life.

22:26.803 --> 22:27.763
You'll find better.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.015
-[sighs]
-For both.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.144
[chuckles] Thank you. Thank you.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.438
I hope so.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.447
Hello!

22:45.530 --> 22:46.948
-Mama.
-[chuckles]

22:50.410 --> 22:52.579
[chuckling] How crappy is your day, dear?

22:52.662 --> 22:54.373
Well, that's such a kind assumption.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.750
If your day was fabulous,

22:56.833 --> 22:59.711
your daughter would not have called me,
begging me to rescue her.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.672
Katydid! Nana's here!

23:03.090 --> 23:05.884
You know she's not supposed
to use the phone without permission.

23:05.967 --> 23:09.137
Well, just be grateful that she called me
instead of someone less fun.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.640
Oh! Nuh-uh-uh.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.726
Oh, you're--
Good girl! You're doing your resume!

23:15.602 --> 23:17.562
But not very well. But you're doing it!

23:17.646 --> 23:18.939
Okay, well, don't help, Mama.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.149
Mothers returning to the workforce

23:21.233 --> 23:23.860
should be thinking
in terms of relevant experience.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.529
For instance, um,

23:25.612 --> 23:29.408
organizing school field trips is material
and manpower management.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.701
When was the last time you did a resume?

23:32.202 --> 23:34.871
Never, I have a catalog.
My paintings speak for me.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.790
Well, then you should probably be
the last person

23:36.873 --> 23:38.667
giving me advice on writing one.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.294
Why does everyone think
they can sit in judgment in my life?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.839
People are trying to help you
because they love you,

23:43.922 --> 23:46.508
and they believe that you deserve better.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.177
[door opens]

23:49.261 --> 23:51.555
Me and my friends are ready to go, Nana!

23:51.972 --> 23:54.474
Well, then let's go and have ourselves...

23:54.558 --> 23:56.435
[kisses] ...an adventure!

23:56.518 --> 23:58.395
Oh, you know what you have to do
before we go.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.564
-Bye, Mommy.
-Bye, baby.

24:02.023 --> 24:02.941
Have fun.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.569
How bad can the world be, really?

24:06.862 --> 24:09.448
[Paula] So, are we gonna go get
those black shoes today?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.616
-[Katie] Yeah.
-[Paula] You're very grown-up!

24:11.700 --> 24:12.617
[Katie chuckles]

24:16.204 --> 24:18.206
So you have heard of the Pickle Jar?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.916
I haven't been inside one.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.002
But the commercials make it look like
an arcade

24:22.085 --> 24:24.379
crossed with a barn
wrapped up in a burger joint.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.381
-Yeah.
-They're loud and messy,

24:26.465 --> 24:27.924
and they don't have ice cream!

24:28.008 --> 24:29.885
-[laughs]
-[Neville] They wanna buy the whole block.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.637
Us, the hardware store,
and the dry cleaner.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.347
The Gibsons don't wanna sell.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.517
Collins, he'd sell the hardware store
and leave town tomorrow.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.768
What do you want to do?

24:40.103 --> 24:42.397
Serenity does need the new business.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.024
Just not this one.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.234
It would be great to travel.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.611
You'd be bored in a week.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.653
[chuckling]

24:48.737 --> 24:50.780
Do I sense a lack of consensus?

24:50.864 --> 24:52.908
Mr. Worry Wart here is suddenly thinking

24:52.991 --> 24:55.994
that maybe we should sell
for the greater good.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.663
Go along with Collins,

24:58.747 --> 24:59.956
persuade the Gibsons,

25:00.040 --> 25:03.043
and use the money to help Serenity
in some new way.

25:03.126 --> 25:07.672
Which is why we wanted to see
what you think of the offer.

25:08.131 --> 25:10.675
We <i>do </i>need to think
of the greater good here.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.889
You and I have always been committed
to bringing business to Serenity, Helen.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.350
Why else be on Town Council?

25:19.017 --> 25:21.436
But as happy as Grace and I are here...

25:21.853 --> 25:22.729
[sighs]

25:22.812 --> 25:24.898
...if you think this is a good offer
and we--

25:24.981 --> 25:28.777
They're lowballing you. Significantly.
They won't come up in any meaningful way.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.403
Thank you, Jesus!

25:30.904 --> 25:32.989
All right, sugar. We are not selling.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.366
Helen says it's okay.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.660
But what happens to Collins?

25:36.743 --> 25:40.038
Well,
we can work on finding him another option,

25:40.121 --> 25:41.039
if he'll let us.

25:41.623 --> 25:45.126
Helen Decatur,
I'm making you a milkshake to celebrate.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.044
Yes.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.338
[laughing]

25:49.256 --> 25:50.423
[Annie] I've got dessert!

25:51.049 --> 25:53.176
-Yay! Chef Erik brownies!
-[Annie chuckles]

25:53.260 --> 25:55.053
Mom knows they're your favorite.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.763
So, Margarita Night underway?

25:56.846 --> 25:58.723
Yeah, uh, Aunt Helen came in
with Mom and me.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.809
-They're in the living room.
-As always.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.771
Uh, no, thanks. I gotta bounce.
I'm meeting Luke.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.398
Should I put it in the fridge?

26:06.481 --> 26:07.482
I'll take that!

26:10.527 --> 26:12.696
-Would you like to go--
<i>-Trollhunters!</i>

26:12.779 --> 26:14.030

26:14.114 --> 26:15.282
Captain, you have the comm.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.492
Wow, great power and great responsibility.

26:17.909 --> 26:18.868
I believe in you.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.121
All right, y'all. Don't have too much fun.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.546
[women laughing]

26:32.007 --> 26:33.300
[all] Pour it out.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.634
[laughs]

26:35.635 --> 26:36.469
Mmm.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.265
-[door closes]
-Oh. Ooh!

26:40.348 --> 26:41.808
This touches my soul.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.560
The companions or the margaritas?

26:43.643 --> 26:45.270
Mmm. Yes.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.896
[Helen, Maddie, laughing]

26:46.980 --> 26:48.648
I thank heavens for Margarita Nights.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.900
I truly, truly believe

26:50.984 --> 26:53.111
that there is not a problem in this world

26:53.194 --> 26:55.947
that cannot be solved
by having a drink and a talk

26:56.448 --> 26:57.490
with the two of you.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.450
Mmm.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.243
It's been a week, hasn't it?

27:00.327 --> 27:02.203
Oof. Yeah, my week had a week.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.163
[Helen] Hey.

27:04.539 --> 27:06.416
Right. I fired Brad.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.002
So I have to find a new sous-chef and...

27:09.836 --> 27:12.422
ugh, just regular kitchen turmoil.

27:12.505 --> 27:16.051
Oh, and also my daughter hates me
and hates Serenity

27:16.134 --> 27:18.345
and can't wait to get away
from both of us, so--

27:18.428 --> 27:19.596
What happened with Annie?

27:19.679 --> 27:22.182
She is going through
that very special phase.

27:22.265 --> 27:26.686
Serenity is small and slow
and she must see the world.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.979
Oh, I remember that phase.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.316
Yeah. You do, and you did it.
You left. Cheers.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.276
Yes, cheers. [chuckles]

27:33.777 --> 27:39.115
All right, well,
this is what Annie thinks of Serenity.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.119
[Helen] Whatever happened
to expressing yourself

27:43.203 --> 27:44.871
through bad haircuts and loud music?

27:44.954 --> 27:46.498
-[Dana Sue] Thank you.
-[Maddie] These are good.

27:46.581 --> 27:47.666
No.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.751
-Not the possum.
-[Helen] That's a possum!

27:49.834 --> 27:51.503
-But the pictures.
-[Helen] Uh-uh.

27:51.586 --> 27:52.837
She should keep this up.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.799
Well, this isn't really how
I want her to see Serenity.

27:55.882 --> 27:59.594
You can encourage her art while also
continuing to change her point of view.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.804
[Dana Sue] But the art, right?

28:00.887 --> 28:02.514
[Maddie] I'm sorry, Dana Sue.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.224
And I'm sorry about Brad.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.435
Is that why you're carrying that
weight of the world look on your face?

28:08.645 --> 28:09.604
You mean this?

28:09.979 --> 28:11.272
[laughing]

28:11.356 --> 28:13.608
It's all the rage this season, you know?
[laughs]

28:13.692 --> 28:14.776
And it goes perfectly

28:14.859 --> 28:18.071
with my "Are you sure
you want my opinion?" lipstick.

28:18.154 --> 28:21.866
Mmm. I highly recommend
the "Don't make me smack you" nail polish.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.118
[Maddie] Favorite shade.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.953
You know, all this beauty talk
sure makes me wish

28:25.036 --> 28:29.332
we were going somewhere soothing
and relaxing,

28:29.416 --> 28:30.834
like a spa.

28:30.917 --> 28:35.171
Mmm. Oh my, yes.
I would do anything to go to one.

28:35.255 --> 28:38.216
-Me too.
-Or better yet, to run one!

28:38.299 --> 28:39.175
Stop.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.220
I know you guys mean well,
but my life is insane.

28:42.929 --> 28:46.266
I'm holding it together
by duct tape and happy thoughts

28:46.349 --> 28:47.559
and I'm near out of both.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.395
Which makes this the perfect time
to start something new.

28:50.478 --> 28:53.231
I mean, I don't know
if it's going to restock your duct tape,

28:53.314 --> 28:54.190
but...

28:54.941 --> 28:57.485
-those happy thoughts will just--
-[Maddie] What about you?

28:57.569 --> 29:01.156
You're swamped at the restaurant.
You think you can take this on too?

29:01.239 --> 29:03.616
You know me.
The busier I am, the happier I am.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.912
Maddie, you are a terrific manager.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.706
And you have a gift for marketing.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.167
You remember what that boutique
in Charleston looked like

29:12.250 --> 29:13.835
-before you started?
-Barely.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.837
That was before the kids.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.465
That was how you put Bill
through medical school.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.424
Mmm.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.592
Another lifetime.

29:20.675 --> 29:23.303
And another lifetime starts right now.

When have we ever led you astray?

Don't answer that.

I cannot answer that.

That's not the way to convince her!
Don't lie to her!

30:06.846 --> 30:07.931
I take it back.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.474

30:16.231 --> 30:19.859
Then what is it that binds us together
as a congregation?

30:19.943 --> 30:20.902
As a community?

30:21.528 --> 30:23.905
Is it habit? Obligation?

30:24.989 --> 30:28.326
Or is it a shared vision of the future

30:28.409 --> 30:33.164
informed by the simple,
eloquent commandment to love one another?

30:33.748 --> 30:36.292
If we can trust that sharing,

30:36.376 --> 30:37.210
that commitment,

30:37.293 --> 30:40.797
then we can go forward
and do great things for each other

30:40.880 --> 30:42.215

34:51.255 --> 34:52.757
You just need to give them some time.

34:53.549 --> 34:55.968
And it wouldn't hurt
to show them a little understanding.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.305
Well, it wouldn't hurt
if they showed me a little respect.

35:01.307 --> 35:03.434
My daddy taught me that respect is earned.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.728

47:08.075 --> 47:09.284
She's in Charleston.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.788
But she's a straight-talking woman.
Strong opinions.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.665
I don't know that you two would get along.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.125
[laughing]

47:24.716 --> 47:25.592
Mama?

47:26.134 --> 47:28.971
Oh, my goodness! A surprise visit!

47:29.054 --> 47:30.347
[both chuckle]

47:30.848 --> 47:31.723
Aw...

47:32.266 --> 47:34.852
Ooh! And an unsolicited kiss.

47:34.935 --> 47:35.978
What happened?

47:36.645 --> 47:38.105
I made a mistake.

47:38.188 --> 47:40.774
Well, you didn't make me a grandma
before 40

47:40.858 --> 47:43.068
and in this town, that's saying something.

47:44.152 --> 47:45.904
So how bad could your mistake be?

47:45.988 --> 47:48.407
Well, I had a moment today
where I realized

47:48.490 --> 47:50.409
that a child does not always understand

47:50.492 --> 47:52.911
when their parent is trying
to take care of them.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.586
So I wanted to apologize to you

48:00.669 --> 48:02.671
for snapping at you Saturday about...

48:03.589 --> 48:04.464
well, everything.

48:05.132 --> 48:06.341
You could've called.

48:06.758 --> 48:09.261
Oh please, darlin'.
I was raised better than that.

48:09.344 --> 48:10.345
[chuckles]

48:10.888 --> 48:12.014
Oh, sweet girl.

48:12.431 --> 48:14.516
I am so sorry

48:14.600 --> 48:17.603
that life is kicking you in the fanny
so hard right now.

48:18.353 --> 48:19.271
[sobs]

48:19.897 --> 48:24.109
[sighs] What you need is a lavender bath
and a glass of Merlot.

48:24.192 --> 48:27.321
Oh, as lovely as that sounds, I can't.
I gotta get going.

48:27.404 --> 48:31.074
No, Maddie. If you don't start
taking care of yourself,

48:31.742 --> 48:33.702
who's gonna take care of your children?

48:34.494 --> 48:35.579
Your friends?

48:35.662 --> 48:37.539
And all the people counting on you?

48:37.623 --> 48:40.042
Mama, you sound like Helen and Dana Sue.

48:40.834 --> 48:42.461
What're you going on about?

48:42.544 --> 48:44.254
Oh, they... [chuckles]

48:44.338 --> 48:47.382
They have this crazy idea
about opening a spa

48:47.466 --> 48:49.301
and having me run it, and I just...

48:49.718 --> 48:51.428
They keep telling me
how wonderful it'll be,

48:51.511 --> 48:52.512
but honestly, it...

48:53.221 --> 48:55.849
it sounds overwhelming. And terrifying.

48:56.642 --> 48:58.518
I thought you were done

48:58.602 --> 49:01.104
with other people planning your life
for you.

49:02.356 --> 49:03.231
Yes, ma'am.

49:04.733 --> 49:07.527
Now, if you want to do it, do it.

49:07.611 --> 49:10.322
Now if you think it's a crazy idea,
tell them.

49:11.281 --> 49:14.451
Those girls love you.
They'll respect your decision.

49:15.786 --> 49:20.165
You chart... your own path.

49:21.750 --> 49:22.918
-All right?
-Okay.

49:23.001 --> 49:24.252
-Okay.
-[laughs]

49:24.878 --> 49:26.463
I love you so much.

49:26.546 --> 49:27.506
I love you too.

She's overwhelmed,
and I can't say that I blame her.

50:24.813 --> 50:26.773
So why would she wanna meet us here?
