WEBVTT

00:11.330 --> 00:12.539
I lost this dagger.

00:12.873 --> 00:13.873
To whom?

00:14.497 --> 00:15.664
Tyrion Lannister.

00:17.456 --> 00:19.455
Take a step toward a more productive relationship

00:19.456 --> 00:20.456
with a possible ally.

00:20.664 --> 00:22.663
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass

00:22.664 --> 00:23.913
and forge weapons from it.

00:23.914 --> 00:24.914
Thank you.

00:25.873 --> 00:28.789
She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.

00:29.372 --> 00:31.122
How do you propose to stop them?

00:31.539 --> 00:34.039
We are currently at work on a solution.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.664
I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.

00:41.873 --> 00:43.413
Jon Snow came down from Castle Black

00:43.414 --> 00:45.614
with a wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.

00:45.789 --> 00:46.873
He's King of the North now.

00:49.290 --> 00:50.490
Your sister's dead.

00:51.039 --> 00:52.079
Euron has her.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.706
I couldn't save her. I tried.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.205
You wouldn't be here if you'd tried.

00:58.706 --> 00:59.873
What about Casterly Rock?

01:08.456 --> 01:11.039
We both know how expensive war can be.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.539
Your vaults are empty.

01:12.831 --> 01:14.372
My debt will be paid in full.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.371
How will it happen?

01:16.372 --> 01:17.455
Will there be pain?

01:17.456 --> 01:18.873
No, I'll make sure of that.

01:19.164 --> 01:20.831
I'd hate to die like your son.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.414
Not at all what I intended.

01:23.873 --> 01:24.956
Tell Cersei.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.789
I want her to know it was me.

03:37.497 --> 03:39.497
Hold that wagon!

03:53.664 --> 03:55.913
You've just won the biggest prize in the world.

03:55.914 --> 03:58.164
What could you possibly have to be upset about?

04:00.247 --> 04:02.371
Come on, you can tell me.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.913
Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls

04:04.914 --> 04:06.246
before saying goodbye?

04:06.247 --> 04:08.830
I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.038
There is no more High Septon.

04:11.039 --> 04:13.288
No, there isn't, is there?

04:13.289 --> 04:16.581
There is still the question of my prize.

04:18.414 --> 04:21.245
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

04:21.247 --> 04:22.581
It's not a castle.

04:24.247 --> 04:26.413
How about that one? It's available.

04:26.414 --> 04:27.788
You don't want Highgarden.

04:27.789 --> 04:30.580
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

04:30.581 --> 04:33.789
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back the day after you move in.

04:35.164 --> 04:37.038
Besides, think of the upkeep.

04:37.039 --> 04:40.079
The more you owe, the more it weighs you down.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.663
Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?

04:42.664 --> 04:44.581
All your new riches weighing you down?

04:45.956 --> 04:48.121
- Move out!
- They're not mine.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.872
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.

04:50.873 --> 04:54.121
See? We pay our debts.

04:54.122 --> 04:55.956
Right, just not to me.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.621
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of...

05:00.622 --> 05:03.079
whatever nameless shit heap you're from

05:03.080 --> 05:04.997
with a saddlebag full of gold,

05:04.998 --> 05:07.455
complaining about not getting paid.

05:07.456 --> 05:09.246
When we win this war,

05:09.247 --> 05:11.121
all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms

05:11.122 --> 05:12.580
will be yours to choose from,

05:12.581 --> 05:13.997
with no one left to take them away from you.

05:13.998 --> 05:15.872
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign

05:15.873 --> 05:17.329
will be quiet and peaceable.

05:17.330 --> 05:18.913
Ah, stranger things have happened.

05:18.914 --> 05:19.956
Like what?

05:21.998 --> 05:24.955
The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.

05:24.956 --> 05:27.788
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

05:27.789 --> 05:29.455
from all the farms in the Reach.

05:29.456 --> 05:31.788
Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys

05:31.789 --> 05:33.955
and help them accelerate this process?

05:33.956 --> 05:35.955
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

05:35.956 --> 05:41.121
No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest...

05:41.122 --> 05:43.164
I bet you're going to have a real talent for that.

05:45.289 --> 05:46.997
My lord.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.122
My lord.

05:50.330 --> 05:51.330
My lord.

06:01.956 --> 06:04.246
I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank

06:04.247 --> 06:08.997
has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.

06:08.998 --> 06:13.204
I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man,

06:13.205 --> 06:16.830
but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.

06:16.831 --> 06:19.038
You're too kind, my lord.

06:19.039 --> 06:22.204
I am neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.

06:22.205 --> 06:25.371
I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent.

06:25.372 --> 06:29.121
Its well-being is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.205
And the current arithmetic is outstanding.

06:33.414 --> 06:35.496
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

06:35.497 --> 06:39.496
My brother is supervising its transportation himself.

06:39.497 --> 06:42.413
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.

06:42.414 --> 06:45.163
They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.

06:45.164 --> 06:48.413
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.

06:48.414 --> 06:50.872
Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance

06:50.873 --> 06:53.663
in some current venture.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.621
My only venture at this moment

06:55.622 --> 06:58.288
is reestablishing control over this continent

06:58.289 --> 07:00.580
and every person on it.

07:00.581 --> 07:03.413
I see a great deal of potential in that venture.

07:03.414 --> 07:07.371
I imagine it would require outside investment.

07:07.372 --> 07:08.621
It will, indeed.

07:08.622 --> 07:11.580
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

07:11.581 --> 07:15.288
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.

07:15.289 --> 07:16.496
I know them well.

07:16.497 --> 07:18.955
They have helped us recover significant sums

07:18.956 --> 07:21.913
from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.

07:21.914 --> 07:23.621
That's good to hear.

07:23.622 --> 07:27.039
I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.

07:28.456 --> 07:30.747
Rest assured, Your Grace,

07:30.748 --> 07:33.663
you can count on the Iron Bank's support.

07:33.664 --> 07:36.706
- Hmm.
- As soon as the gold arrives.

07:40.456 --> 07:41.789
This is for you.

07:46.581 --> 07:49.288
The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat,

07:49.289 --> 07:51.122
but your mother fought him off.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.955
The other dagger,

08:01.956 --> 08:04.621
the one that took her life,

08:04.622 --> 08:07.830
I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart

08:07.831 --> 08:09.247
if I could have.

08:11.330 --> 08:13.956
I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.

08:15.664 --> 08:18.663
But I am here for her now

08:18.664 --> 08:21.371
to do what she would have done,

08:21.372 --> 08:23.330
to protect her children.

08:25.914 --> 08:29.830
Anything I can do for you, Brandon,

08:29.831 --> 08:32.164
you need only ask.

08:34.664 --> 08:37.371
Do you know who this belonged to?

08:37.371 --> 08:40.078
No.

08:40.080 --> 08:43.913
That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.

08:43.914 --> 08:48.329
In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.

08:48.330 --> 08:50.204
Forced from your home,

08:50.205 --> 08:52.705
driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.

08:52.706 --> 08:57.456
I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.

09:06.914 --> 09:10.038
To go through all of that and make your way home again

09:10.039 --> 09:14.663
only to find such chaos in the world,

09:14.664 --> 09:15.705
I can only imagine...

09:15.706 --> 09:17.664
Chaos is a ladder.

09:30.039 --> 09:32.955
I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.

09:32.956 --> 09:34.372
I'm not Lord Stark.

09:45.748 --> 09:47.872
What's that?

09:47.873 --> 09:49.872
Maester Wolkan built it for me

09:49.873 --> 09:51.413
so I can move around more easily.

09:51.414 --> 09:53.247
It's a very good idea.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.956
You're leaving.

09:59.247 --> 10:00.913
I don't want to leave you,

10:00.914 --> 10:03.913
but when... when they come,

10:03.914 --> 10:05.622
I need to be with my family.

10:06.831 --> 10:08.705
And you're safe.

10:08.706 --> 10:10.581
Well, as safe as anyone can be now.

10:11.706 --> 10:13.914
You don't need me anymore.

10:14.998 --> 10:16.539
No, I don't.

10:20.998 --> 10:22.118
That's all you've got to say?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.164
Thank you.

10:26.622 --> 10:28.621
Thank you?

10:28.622 --> 10:30.289
For helping me.

10:32.205 --> 10:34.413
My brother died for you.

10:34.414 --> 10:37.121
Hodor and Summer died for you.

10:37.122 --> 10:39.456
I almost died for you.

10:43.289 --> 10:46.289
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.788
Not anymore.

10:51.956 --> 10:55.246
I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark,

10:55.247 --> 10:58.748
but I remember so much else now.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.456
You died in that cave.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.246
I did.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.663
The kitchen girl, the redhead with the behind.

11:49.664 --> 11:54.329
The only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver.

11:54.330 --> 11:57.663
'Ey up. Where you going?

11:57.664 --> 12:00.204
In there. I live here.

12:00.205 --> 12:01.913
Fuck off.

12:01.914 --> 12:03.998
I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

12:07.873 --> 12:09.497
Arya Stark's dead.

12:12.205 --> 12:14.329
Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrick.

12:14.330 --> 12:17.371
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

12:17.372 --> 12:19.204
Maester's named Wolkan.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.371
Go ask Jon Snow, then, the King in the North.

12:22.372 --> 12:24.913
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand miles away.

12:24.914 --> 12:27.705
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

12:27.706 --> 12:31.079
- so, you know, best fuck off.
- Mm.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.956
If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?

12:35.289 --> 12:39.121
The Lady of Winterfell. Lady Stark.

12:39.122 --> 12:40.830
- Which Lady Stark?
- You tell us.

12:40.831 --> 12:42.581
You're the one impersonating her sister.

12:46.289 --> 12:48.413
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

12:48.414 --> 12:52.747
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us.

12:52.748 --> 12:56.079
So, for the last time, fuck off.

13:00.330 --> 13:03.204
I'm getting into this castle one way or another.

13:03.205 --> 13:06.705
If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.

13:06.706 --> 13:10.748
But if I am and Sansa finds out you turned me away...

13:18.330 --> 13:20.955
Right, you sit there.

13:20.956 --> 13:23.163
Right there.

13:23.164 --> 13:24.164
Don't move.

13:25.789 --> 13:28.121
Right, go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

13:28.122 --> 13:31.455
I ain't telling Lady Stark. You can tell her.

13:31.456 --> 13:32.831
Why me?

13:58.039 --> 14:00.079
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.997
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face

14:02.998 --> 14:04.372
as hard as I can.

14:12.664 --> 14:14.121
We told her to wait.

14:14.122 --> 14:16.872
We were standing right next to her, and...

14:16.873 --> 14:18.997
And... and when we turned around, she'd gone, my lady.

14:18.998 --> 14:20.872
She... she was nothing. Some winter town girl.

14:20.873 --> 14:23.663
She comes in asking for, uh, Ser Rodrick...

14:23.664 --> 14:26.163
- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
- And Maester Luwin.

14:26.164 --> 14:28.580
And don't trouble yourself over it, my lady.

14:28.581 --> 14:31.788
- We'll... we'll find her.
- You don't have to.

14:31.789 --> 14:33.288
I know where she is.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.831
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

14:53.914 --> 14:55.539
Yes.

15:12.622 --> 15:14.955
You shouldn't have run from the guards.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.997
I didn't run.

15:16.998 --> 15:18.372
You need better guards.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.205
It suits you... Lady Stark.

15:29.372 --> 15:31.246
Jon left you in charge?

15:31.247 --> 15:32.622
He did.

15:34.039 --> 15:36.538
I hope he comes back soon.

15:36.539 --> 15:38.371
I remember how happy he was to see me.

15:38.372 --> 15:41.705
When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.

15:51.581 --> 15:53.788
It doesn't look like him.

15:53.789 --> 15:57.079
Should've been carved by someone who knew his face.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.080
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

16:02.414 --> 16:03.581
We're not.

16:09.247 --> 16:11.329
They say you killed Joffrey.

16:11.330 --> 16:13.621
Did you?

16:13.622 --> 16:15.288
I wish I had.

16:15.289 --> 16:18.329
Hmm. Me, too.

16:18.330 --> 16:20.956
I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.

16:22.956 --> 16:25.621
However long my list got, he was always first.

16:25.622 --> 16:27.538
Your list?

16:27.539 --> 16:29.748
Of people I'm going to kill.

16:39.622 --> 16:42.371
How did you get back to Winterfell?

16:42.372 --> 16:44.204
It's a long story.

16:44.205 --> 16:46.288
I imagine yours is, too.

16:46.289 --> 16:48.246
Yes.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.371
Not a very pleasant one.

16:50.372 --> 16:52.372
Mine neither.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.121
But our stories aren't over yet.

16:58.122 --> 17:00.998
No, they're not.

17:08.122 --> 17:09.497
Arya...

17:13.079 --> 17:14.204
Bran's home, too.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.873
You came home.

18:07.748 --> 18:09.748
I saw you at the crossroads.

18:11.581 --> 18:12.913
You saw me?

18:12.914 --> 18:15.413
I see quite a lot now.

18:15.414 --> 18:20.246
Bran has... visions.

18:20.247 --> 18:22.413
I thought you might go to King's Landing.

18:22.414 --> 18:24.663
So did I.

18:24.664 --> 18:26.538
Why would you go back there?

18:26.539 --> 18:29.122
Cersei's on her list of names.

18:40.664 --> 18:42.538
Who else is on your list?

18:42.539 --> 18:44.289
Most of them are dead already.

18:55.414 --> 18:57.747
Where did you get this?

18:57.748 --> 18:59.164
Littlefinger gave it to me.

19:00.456 --> 19:02.705
Littlefinger? He's here?

19:02.706 --> 19:04.580
He has declared for House Stark.

19:04.581 --> 19:06.455
Why would he give you a dagger?

19:06.456 --> 19:08.955
- He thought I'd want it.
- Why?

19:08.956 --> 19:10.663
Because it was meant to kill me.

19:10.664 --> 19:15.538
The cutthroat... after your fall?

19:15.539 --> 19:18.413
Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?

19:18.414 --> 19:21.455
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

19:21.456 --> 19:22.621
He's not a generous man.

19:22.622 --> 19:23.997
He wouldn't give you anything

19:23.998 --> 19:25.914
unless he thought he was getting something back.

19:28.289 --> 19:31.288
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

19:31.289 --> 19:33.205
I don't want it.

19:37.497 --> 19:38.539
Are you sure?

19:39.831 --> 19:41.246
It's Valyrian steel.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.622
It's wasted on a cripple.

20:19.414 --> 20:22.913
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

20:22.914 --> 20:25.288
You kept your vow.

20:25.289 --> 20:26.705
I did next to nothing.

20:26.706 --> 20:28.621
You're too hard on yourself, my lady.

20:28.622 --> 20:30.205
I'm not a...

20:33.372 --> 20:34.998
Thank you, Podrick.

20:52.873 --> 20:56.246
Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.

20:56.247 --> 20:57.913
Soon.

20:57.914 --> 20:59.748
He will come back to you.

21:01.622 --> 21:02.956
He'd better.

21:05.205 --> 21:07.913
What happened?

21:07.914 --> 21:09.247
Many things.

21:12.581 --> 21:13.789
Many things?

21:15.330 --> 21:17.372
Your Grace.

21:45.456 --> 21:46.705
I wanted you to see it

21:46.706 --> 21:49.456
before we start hacking it to bits.

22:26.539 --> 22:29.372
Well, this is it. All we'll ever need.

22:35.414 --> 22:38.873
There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.

23:03.998 --> 23:06.079
The children of the forest made these.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.914
When?

23:13.414 --> 23:15.706
A very long time ago.

23:18.873 --> 23:21.329
They were right here,

23:21.330 --> 23:23.747
standing where we're standing.

23:23.748 --> 23:28.913
Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.

23:28.914 --> 23:30.998
Maybe even before there were men.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.330
No.

23:43.873 --> 23:48.580
They were here together, the children and the First Men.

23:48.581 --> 23:50.789
Doing what? Fighting each other?

24:01.330 --> 24:06.371
They fought together against their common enemy.

24:06.372 --> 24:10.247
Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.

24:12.414 --> 24:13.414
Together.

24:15.247 --> 24:18.330
We need to do the same if we're going to survive.

24:21.956 --> 24:24.164
Because the enemy is real.

24:25.789 --> 24:27.414
It's always been real.

24:37.956 --> 24:39.705
And you say you can't defeat them

24:39.706 --> 24:43.621
without my armies and my dragons?

24:43.622 --> 24:46.247
No, I don't think I can.

24:54.456 --> 24:56.747
I will fight for you.

24:56.748 --> 24:58.622
I will fight for the North.

25:02.706 --> 25:04.873
When you bend the knee.

25:10.497 --> 25:12.039
My people...

25:13.456 --> 25:15.747
won't accept a southern ruler.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.289
Not after everything they've suffered.

25:21.789 --> 25:24.330
They will if their king does.

25:25.998 --> 25:28.997
They chose you to lead them.

25:28.998 --> 25:31.164
They chose you to protect them.

25:32.789 --> 25:35.998
Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

25:56.372 --> 25:58.455
What is it?

25:58.456 --> 26:01.204
We took Casterly Rock.

26:01.205 --> 26:03.205
That's very good to hear.

26:07.706 --> 26:08.873
Isn't it?

26:16.914 --> 26:19.204
You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.

26:19.205 --> 26:20.873
- Perhaps...
- You will stay.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.955
All my allies are gone.

26:23.956 --> 26:26.371
They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.

26:26.372 --> 26:28.913
- You still have the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

26:28.914 --> 26:30.997
because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.

26:30.998 --> 26:32.997
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

26:32.998 --> 26:35.788
We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.

26:35.789 --> 26:38.038
Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.

26:38.039 --> 26:41.079
- We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
- The right plan!

26:41.080 --> 26:45.872
Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

26:45.873 --> 26:49.288
- If I have underestimated our enemies...
- Our enemies?

26:49.289 --> 26:51.538
Your family, you mean.

26:51.539 --> 26:54.413
Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.329
Enough with the clever plans.

27:05.330 --> 27:06.997
I have three large dragons.

27:06.998 --> 27:08.705
I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

27:08.706 --> 27:10.038
We've discussed this.

27:10.039 --> 27:13.288
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

27:13.289 --> 27:16.663
What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?

27:16.664 --> 27:18.414
A smart one.

27:21.789 --> 27:23.789
What do you think I should do?

27:26.122 --> 27:28.371
- I would never presume to...
- I'm at war.

27:28.372 --> 27:30.414
I'm losing.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.956
What do you think I should do?

27:40.539 --> 27:42.997
I never thought that dragons would exist again.

27:42.998 --> 27:43.998
No one did.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.121
The people who follow you

27:48.122 --> 27:51.289
know that you made something impossible happen.

27:52.664 --> 27:54.163
Maybe that helps them believe

27:54.164 --> 27:57.329
that you can make other impossible things happen.

27:57.330 --> 27:59.288
Build a world that's different

27:59.289 --> 28:01.706
from the shit one they've always known.

28:03.956 --> 28:08.329
But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities,

28:08.330 --> 28:09.956
you're not different.

28:11.664 --> 28:13.664
You're just more of the same.

28:28.497 --> 28:30.164
Don't lunge.

28:43.039 --> 28:44.998
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

28:46.664 --> 28:48.039
Up.

28:53.039 --> 28:55.998
- And don't...
- Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

29:01.706 --> 29:03.205
Nice sword.

29:05.497 --> 29:06.831
Very nice dagger.

29:14.205 --> 29:17.163
If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores,

29:17.164 --> 29:19.580
then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.

29:19.581 --> 29:20.873
We can't...

29:25.205 --> 29:26.747
It's been a while since I trained.

29:26.748 --> 29:29.371
I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.

29:29.372 --> 29:32.246
He didn't beat the Hound.

29:32.247 --> 29:34.288
You did.

29:34.289 --> 29:35.789
I want to train with you.

29:37.873 --> 29:41.163
You swore to serve both my mother's daughters,

29:41.164 --> 29:42.289
didn't you?

29:49.956 --> 29:51.581
Move aside, Podrick.

29:56.122 --> 29:58.538
You can't use that, my lady. It's too small.

29:58.539 --> 30:00.748
I won't cut you. Don't worry.

30:02.164 --> 30:04.122
I'll try not to.

31:19.706 --> 31:21.705
Who taught you how to do that?

31:21.706 --> 31:23.372
No one.

31:57.998 --> 32:00.663
- What do you think of her?
- Who?

32:00.664 --> 32:05.121
I believe you know of whom I speak.

32:05.122 --> 32:07.455
I think she has a good heart.

32:07.456 --> 32:09.246
A good heart?

32:09.247 --> 32:11.913
I've noticed you staring at her good heart.

32:11.914 --> 32:14.747
There's no time for that.

32:14.748 --> 32:17.581
I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.496
How many men do we have in the North to fight him?

32:21.497 --> 32:23.038
10,000? Less?

32:23.039 --> 32:25.163
- Fewer.
- What?

32:25.164 --> 32:28.706
Speaking of good hearts... Missandei of Naath.

32:29.831 --> 32:32.705
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

32:32.706 --> 32:34.246
King Snow, isn't it?

32:34.247 --> 32:35.621
No, that doesn't sound right.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.496
- King Jon?
- It doesn't matter.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.329
Forgive me, but may I ask a question?

32:40.330 --> 32:42.288
Of course.

32:42.289 --> 32:46.163
Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?

32:46.164 --> 32:48.330
I'm a bastard.

32:50.205 --> 32:52.288
My mother and father weren't married.

32:52.289 --> 32:54.246
Is the custom different in Naath?

32:54.247 --> 32:56.163
We don't have marriage in Naath,

32:56.164 --> 32:59.121
so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

32:59.122 --> 33:02.622
That sounds... liberating.

33:04.622 --> 33:06.830
Why did you leave your homeland?

33:06.831 --> 33:09.455
I was stolen away by slavers.

33:09.456 --> 33:10.955
I'm sorry.

33:10.956 --> 33:14.079
If I may, how did a slave girl

33:14.080 --> 33:16.329
come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?

33:16.330 --> 33:20.204
She bought me from my master and set me free.

33:20.205 --> 33:21.997
That was good of her.

33:21.998 --> 33:25.955
Of course, you're serving her now, aren't you?

33:25.956 --> 33:30.121
I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.

33:30.122 --> 33:31.872
Because I believe in her.

33:31.873 --> 33:34.830
And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?

33:34.831 --> 33:38.164
Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.

33:39.330 --> 33:40.330
You believe that?

33:41.706 --> 33:43.163
I know it.

33:43.164 --> 33:46.163
All of us who came with her from Essos,

33:46.164 --> 33:47.872
we believe in her.

33:47.873 --> 33:50.538
She's not our queen because she's the daughter

33:50.539 --> 33:53.663
of some king we never knew.

33:53.664 --> 33:56.456
She's the queen we chose.

33:58.039 --> 34:00.330
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

34:05.581 --> 34:07.497
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

34:24.748 --> 34:26.371
Halt!

34:50.914 --> 34:52.581
Jon.

34:55.748 --> 34:57.080
I didn't know you were here.

35:04.247 --> 35:06.414
S-Sansa...

35:08.080 --> 35:10.414
is she all right?

35:11.456 --> 35:13.581
What you did for her...

35:14.873 --> 35:16.914
is the only reason I'm not killing you.

35:25.372 --> 35:27.955
We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.

35:27.956 --> 35:30.788
We thought you were dead.

35:30.789 --> 35:32.413
I should be.

35:32.414 --> 35:33.789
Your sister?

35:35.414 --> 35:37.913
Euron has her.

35:37.914 --> 35:40.622
I came to ask the queen to help me get her back.

35:43.456 --> 35:44.914
The queen is gone.

35:46.789 --> 35:49.246
Where did she go?

35:49.247 --> 35:52.831
Get the horses watered!

36:08.664 --> 36:11.496
All the gold's safely through the gates of King's Landing.

36:11.497 --> 36:12.663
Good.

36:12.664 --> 36:13.997
We need to get the last of these wagons

36:13.998 --> 36:16.079
over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.788
The head of the line is ambushed,

36:17.789 --> 36:20.079
the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.705
Well, we are stretched a bit thin.

36:21.706 --> 36:23.163
With your permission,

36:23.164 --> 36:26.330
flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.788
Let's give them fair warning first.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.706
These men fought well at Highgarden.

36:43.664 --> 36:46.079
Now, get it on this thing.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.330
Lift!

36:51.581 --> 36:53.329
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

36:53.330 --> 36:54.748
Dickon.

36:58.164 --> 37:00.830
I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.

37:00.831 --> 37:02.039
Your first battle?

37:03.873 --> 37:06.246
And?

37:06.247 --> 37:07.496
It was glorious.

37:07.497 --> 37:10.039
Come on, your father's not here.

37:11.539 --> 37:14.455
All my life, we've been pledged to House Tyrell.

37:14.456 --> 37:17.705
I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.

37:17.706 --> 37:20.455
They didn't deserve to die.

37:20.456 --> 37:22.621
But Lady Olenna chose to betray her queen

37:22.622 --> 37:24.747
and support the Targaryen girl.

37:24.748 --> 37:27.705
So here we are.

37:27.706 --> 37:29.872
I didn't expect it to smell like that.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.955
Men shit themselves when they die.

37:31.956 --> 37:34.039
Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?

37:35.914 --> 37:38.080
Well, I learned it when I was five.

37:45.122 --> 37:47.288
What?

37:47.289 --> 37:49.246
Listen.

38:00.956 --> 38:04.705
Spears and shields! Spears and shields!

38:04.706 --> 38:06.246
- What is it?
- Get in line!

38:06.247 --> 38:09.247
Spears and shields! Spears and shields!

38:10.706 --> 38:13.747
Get in line now!

38:13.748 --> 38:15.955
Form up! Come on, lads!

38:15.956 --> 38:17.538
Guard those wagons!

38:17.539 --> 38:19.998
Form a line! Form a line!

38:23.414 --> 38:25.122
Round those spears!

38:31.956 --> 38:34.122
Shield wall!

38:35.456 --> 38:37.121
Fill the gaps!

38:37.122 --> 38:40.455
- Archers, steady!
- Hold together!

38:40.456 --> 38:42.496
- Archers!
- Look alive!

38:42.497 --> 38:44.288
Get tight!

38:44.289 --> 38:46.121
Get in line, boys!

38:46.122 --> 38:48.538
- Ready!
- Here they come!

39:13.539 --> 39:15.872
Courage, lads! Courage!

39:15.873 --> 39:18.788
Wait! Wait for it!

39:18.789 --> 39:20.955
Spears out!

39:25.164 --> 39:28.539
- Spears out!
- Steady! Hold the line!

39:38.247 --> 39:40.830
- Get back to King's Landing.
- I'm not abandoning my army.

39:40.831 --> 39:43.163
You're the commander, not a damn infantryman.

39:43.164 --> 39:45.205
Those fuckers are about to swamp us.

39:46.372 --> 39:48.371
We can hold them off.

40:06.372 --> 40:07.872
Dracarys!

40:45.622 --> 40:48.038
Hold the line!

40:48.039 --> 40:49.414
Hold!

40:50.831 --> 40:52.956
- Hold it, lads!
- Hold the line!

40:56.372 --> 40:59.289
Throw it!

41:01.122 --> 41:02.581
Hold!

41:25.247 --> 41:27.455
Draw!

41:27.456 --> 41:28.456
Loose!

42:03.330 --> 42:05.580
- Archers!
- Archers!

42:05.581 --> 42:07.329
Archers, with me!

42:07.330 --> 42:10.289
- Archers, to the line!
- To the line!

42:15.956 --> 42:17.663
- Nock!
- Nock!

42:17.664 --> 42:20.164
Draw!

42:29.205 --> 42:30.873
- Loose!
- Loose!

42:37.998 --> 42:39.205
Run!

42:50.706 --> 42:52.329
Qyburn's scorpion is over there.

42:52.330 --> 42:53.371
Go get it, then.

42:53.372 --> 42:54.873
I can't shoot with one hand.

42:57.539 --> 42:59.873
Come on!

44:11.831 --> 44:14.289
Need help!

45:16.289 --> 45:17.998
Where are you?

46:28.330 --> 46:30.080
Take cover!

47:26.497 --> 47:27.872
Come on, you fucker.

47:27.873 --> 47:29.039
Dracarys.

48:42.456 --> 48:43.456
Flee, you idiot.

48:45.080 --> 48:47.080
Come on, boy. Come on!

48:55.914 --> 48:58.956
You idiot. You fucking idiot.

50:51.622 --> 50:53.302
I'm not here to murder.

50:53.497 --> 50:55.205
Bend the knee and join me.

50:55.581 --> 50:58.205
Or refuse... and die.

51:00.706 --> 51:03.164
You need to find a way to make her listen.

51:04.205 --> 51:06.045
Whatever stands in our way...

51:07.247 --> 51:08.372
we will defeat.

51:09.706 --> 51:12.496
Bran saw the Night King and his army marching

51:12.497 --> 51:13.706
towards Eastwatch.

51:15.122 --> 51:16.664
Bad things are coming.
