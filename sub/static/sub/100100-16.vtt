00:01.370 --> 00:03.990
So the monster who
ripped this family apart

00:04.000 --> 00:05.750
all those years ago

00:05.750 --> 00:07.950
has brought us all back together.

00:07.950 --> 00:13.390
Ahh. Irony, you are one sick bitch!

00:15.660 --> 00:21.130
And you, my darling sister, are my hero

00:21.130 --> 00:24.430
for finally putting Cartwright to rest.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.380
Knock it off, or your hands go

00:27.380 --> 00:29.100
back in the cuffs.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.280
Take a load off, Daddy.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.960
Farewell, Mr. Caterpillar.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.200
Give my regards to the Queen of Hearts.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.330
How you holding up?

00:45.330 --> 00:47.130
I'm not sure I am.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.870
Kate, do not waste
your guilt on that man.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.870
He does not deserve it.

00:52.870 --> 00:55.040
So we just pretend it never happened?

00:55.040 --> 00:57.580
Tried it. Doesn't work.

00:57.580 --> 01:00.370
Let's be honest. Your brief sojourn

01:00.370 --> 01:03.050
into my hellscape is but a flicker

01:03.050 --> 01:07.520
of my every waking
day for so many years.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.060
Now my Mouse is out in the world alone,

01:11.060 --> 01:12.760
battling his greatest fears.

01:12.760 --> 01:13.880
I need to find him.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.890
We find him together.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.000
I think we have very different ideas

01:18.000 --> 01:21.170
about what happens to Mouse
after we find him, so...

01:22.700 --> 01:24.770
Alice, stop. I cannot let you...

01:27.670 --> 01:30.040
But you can.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.060
It is amazing how distracted you get

01:33.060 --> 01:37.250
when you find out that both
your daughters are killers.

01:37.250 --> 01:41.420
Oh. A friendly reminder. Your
DNA and, uh... tch... your DNA

01:41.420 --> 01:44.690
is all over that body in the ground,

01:44.690 --> 01:47.230
so it's probably best
that you let me slink

01:47.230 --> 01:48.630
back into the shadows,

01:48.630 --> 01:51.600
where nobody has to hear about this.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.130
Family reunion's over.

02:13.790 --> 02:17.120
I never see you again, understood?

02:17.120 --> 02:20.590
Admit it, Batty. Guys
like me give you purpose.

02:20.590 --> 02:22.390
Never again.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.230
Do you understand?

02:35.610 --> 02:36.980
Go!

02:45.120 --> 02:46.480
No.

02:58.790 --> 03:02.060
My dad wants me to put
Cartwright behind me,

03:02.060 --> 03:04.230
but it's not that easy.

03:04.230 --> 03:06.700
I went to a dark place, Bruce,

03:06.700 --> 03:10.040
to avenge Beth, Alice, my mom,

03:10.040 --> 03:13.540
but in saving my sister,
I became more like her,

03:13.540 --> 03:15.740
and in taking out a killer,

03:15.740 --> 03:17.310
I became one myself.

03:19.550 --> 03:22.410
What does that make me now?

03:22.420 --> 03:25.080
- Any luck last night?
- With?

03:25.090 --> 03:26.640
Finding Cartwright.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.990
Because I've got nothing
on him or any of his aliases,

03:28.990 --> 03:31.760
and the thought of Beth's
killer still being out there...

03:31.760 --> 03:33.930
just tell me you found something.

03:33.930 --> 03:36.330
- Nothing on this end either.
- Great.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.900
- Bad news?
- Uh, it's my mom.

03:43.900 --> 03:47.530
Um... Reggie Harris's
post-conviction relief hearing

03:47.530 --> 03:48.970
was moved up.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.610
Reggie Harris.

03:50.610 --> 03:53.250
The guy that killed your dad?

03:53.250 --> 03:56.420
When did it get moved up to?

03:56.420 --> 03:59.150
Today.

03:59.150 --> 04:01.690
- I'll come with you.
- No. No need for that.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.380
Harris was found at Sip & Dash

04:03.380 --> 04:06.260
with the murder weapon and
my dad's blood all over him,

04:06.260 --> 04:09.030
so what's there to review?

04:09.030 --> 04:11.800
- Luke.
- Kate, seriously, I'm fine.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.840
If you want to be helpful,
find Cartwright, okay?

04:17.200 --> 04:20.170
Mouse, have you returned home?

04:22.010 --> 04:24.280
Hello?

04:24.280 --> 04:27.650
Evil henchmen? Is anybody there?

04:30.980 --> 04:32.820
"What a curious plan".

04:47.470 --> 04:49.330
Who did this?

05:11.210 --> 05:14.560
_

05:19.400 --> 05:21.900
I got 4 cameras'
worth of footage missing

05:21.900 --> 05:25.000
from the Sip & Dash on the
night Lucius Fox was murdered

05:25.010 --> 05:29.050
and a $50,000 cleanup
fee sent from The Crows

05:29.050 --> 05:31.840
to Alia Nazari, the Sip & Dash owner.

05:31.850 --> 05:34.780
You think The Crows paid
Nazari to lose the tapes.

05:36.380 --> 05:37.720
Who?

05:37.720 --> 05:39.420
That's what I need you to figure out.

05:39.420 --> 05:41.720
I don't trust anyone
else to look into it.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.090
Must be scraping the
bottom of the barrel, sir.

05:45.560 --> 05:50.560
You suspended me for lying.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.200
I still haven't changed
my opinion on Batwoman.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.470
I think we can both
agree that this is bigger

05:55.470 --> 05:57.470
than two different opinions.

05:57.470 --> 06:00.240
There should have been
footage of Fox's murder.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.770
There wasn't.

06:01.780 --> 06:03.440
Let me see if I can meet with Nazari

06:03.440 --> 06:05.440
and get her side of the story.

06:05.450 --> 06:07.810
This has to stay between us.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.650
Consider me back on payroll.

06:24.530 --> 06:27.380
_

06:31.740 --> 06:33.810
_

06:40.850 --> 06:42.150
Hey.

06:44.650 --> 06:47.620
I got your text last night...

06:47.620 --> 06:52.760
Late, like up when
you shouldn't be late.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.430
I'm just checking in to
make sure you're good.

07:04.140 --> 07:06.870
Your mother was a beautiful woman.

07:06.870 --> 07:09.010
It would have been a pity
for her to go to waste.

07:09.010 --> 07:10.840
Ohh!

07:10.840 --> 07:14.310
You stole everything from me!

07:17.380 --> 07:18.850
Kate!

07:24.720 --> 07:26.360
You missed a spot.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.990
What are you doing here?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.710
Oh. I've come to ask for your assistance

07:29.710 --> 07:31.330
in locating someone.

07:31.330 --> 07:33.360
Let me guess. You need help finding

07:33.360 --> 07:36.170
the guy who put Dad in
jail and killed Catherine.

07:36.170 --> 07:39.500
Both done at my request.

07:39.510 --> 07:41.710
Didn't he also try to kill you?

07:41.710 --> 07:44.840
And yet I still forgive him,

07:44.850 --> 07:47.210
choosing to see the best in him.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.080
Ever try that?

07:49.080 --> 07:51.550
All the time. Never works out.

07:53.550 --> 07:55.550
When I was dosed with Fear Toxin,

07:55.560 --> 07:58.860
I relived all my worst fears.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.690
If Daddy hadn't saved
me, there's no telling

08:00.690 --> 08:02.330
what I would have done to myself

08:02.330 --> 08:05.060
or anyone else to make the horror end.

08:05.070 --> 08:06.470
The Crows will find him.

08:06.470 --> 08:10.770
The Crows won't hesitate
to put a bullet in his head.

08:10.770 --> 08:12.400
Don't want another death on your hands.

08:12.410 --> 08:14.040
I want you to leave, Alice.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.840
That is precisely the plan.

08:16.840 --> 08:19.240
Once I find Mouse, I will flee

08:19.240 --> 08:21.050
this wretched city for good.

08:21.050 --> 08:22.380
Why should I believe you?

08:24.620 --> 08:26.420
My Cats and Rabbits are dead.

08:26.420 --> 08:28.750
What are you talking about?

08:28.760 --> 08:32.090
Let's just say subtlety is...

08:32.100 --> 08:34.090
not a defining characteristic of someone

08:34.100 --> 08:35.730
I wronged in the past.

08:35.730 --> 08:38.429
- Who?
- Careful, Kate.

08:38.429 --> 08:41.370
You're starting to sound interested.

08:41.370 --> 08:43.270
Just help me, and you will never

08:43.270 --> 08:44.900
have to deal with me again.

08:47.910 --> 08:50.310
Fine...

08:50.310 --> 08:52.380
But on one condition.

08:52.380 --> 08:53.750
We do it my way.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.920
Ohh. Considering your way involved

08:59.920 --> 09:02.020
strangling a man until
he choked to death

09:02.020 --> 09:03.620
on his own blood, I would love

09:03.620 --> 09:05.390
absolutely nothing more!

09:12.420 --> 09:14.220
Kate, everything okay?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.860
Thought I'd offer a hand
in the search for Mouse.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.230
Oh, we got our bases covered.

09:19.230 --> 09:21.430
Take a load off, kiddo. Get some sleep.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.820
I'd sleep better if I knew
there were one less lunatic

09:23.820 --> 09:25.030
on the streets of Gotham.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.870
Yeah, you and me both.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.100
Mouse attacked a nurse
outside of Arkham last night.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.100
- Nearly killed her.
- Arkham?

09:31.110 --> 09:33.040
Why would he go back there?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.680
Well, we'll figure it out.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.440
Get some rest. I'll
call you when we get him.

09:37.450 --> 09:38.850
Thanks.

09:41.050 --> 09:44.250
Why is Mouse attacking
nurses outside Arkham?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.020
He lived there for years.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.890
A real fan favorite.

09:48.890 --> 09:52.260
The warden Dr... Butler,

09:52.260 --> 09:55.120
an all-around vile,
waste of a soothing voice,

09:55.120 --> 09:56.530
used him as a guinea pig.

09:56.530 --> 09:59.200
He'd subject Mouse to Fear
Toxin, gauge its effects,

09:59.200 --> 10:01.270
have the nurses pull him out of it,

10:01.270 --> 10:03.740
and then start all over the next day.

10:03.740 --> 10:06.470
Do you think that Mouse
is still feeling the toxin?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.240
Cartwright dosed him for days.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.210
I'm still... shaking off the effects

10:11.210 --> 10:12.660
after only one afternoon.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.920
I can only imagine the hell he's in.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.270
Maybe he's looking for someone
to pull him back out of it,

10:17.280 --> 10:19.550
someone like one of his former nurses.

10:19.550 --> 10:21.090
What are you doing?

10:21.090 --> 10:24.220
Hmm. Just checking to see
if we're the same size.

10:24.230 --> 10:25.560
Why?

10:33.840 --> 10:36.240
I do the talking.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.500
Go ahead.

10:40.110 --> 10:41.240
Hello?

10:41.240 --> 10:42.920
Hi. I'm Agent Kane,

10:42.930 --> 10:45.250
and we're with the undercover
unit of Crows Security.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.310
Oh. Not in trouble, am I?

10:47.320 --> 10:50.250
No, but you could be in danger.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.650
We're looking for one
of your former patients,

10:52.660 --> 10:54.230
uh, Jonathan Cartwright.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.120
Goes by Mouse.

10:56.130 --> 10:59.450
Mouse? Yes. He's a sweet boy

10:59.450 --> 11:01.260
but beyond help sadly.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.960
Oh. That's so sad.

11:03.970 --> 11:05.870
We got word that he
might be coming here.

11:05.870 --> 11:08.440
Here? He's locked away at Arkham.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.600
He escaped last year, and we think

11:10.600 --> 11:12.470
that he's been targeting
his former nurses.

11:12.470 --> 11:14.100
Do you mind if we wait inside

11:14.100 --> 11:16.680
so we can grab him if he comes?

11:16.680 --> 11:19.510
Please. Come in.

11:24.890 --> 11:28.160
♪ And I remember... ♪

11:28.160 --> 11:30.290
Can I offer you anything?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.160
Just finished making some brownies.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.800
- We're good.
- A brownie would be nice.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.670
♪ Now I write new love songs from... ♪

11:38.670 --> 11:40.130
Seriously.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.870
We buried a body this morning.

11:41.870 --> 11:44.500
When did you have time to eat?

11:51.850 --> 11:53.310
All rise!

11:54.990 --> 11:56.520
The court is now in session,

11:56.520 --> 11:58.550
the honorable judge
Wellington presiding.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.420
You may be seated.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.890
This is the case of The
People v. Reggie Harris.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.560
What are you doing here?

12:09.570 --> 12:11.730
Heard about what was happening today,

12:11.730 --> 12:15.130
and I appreciate the whole
I need to be alone thing,

12:15.130 --> 12:17.050
but as someone whose
parent was just murdered

12:17.050 --> 12:19.010
and the killer was
never brought to justice,

12:19.010 --> 12:21.880
alone is not where you
need to be right now.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.410
Thanks.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.280
Where's your mom?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.420
She barely made it through the funeral.

12:30.420 --> 12:34.550
Imagine her being in the
same room as my dad's killer.

13:05.590 --> 13:06.920
Mrs. Nazari?

13:08.960 --> 13:11.630
Mrs. Nazari, it's Sophie Moore.

13:28.810 --> 13:30.910
Unh!

13:30.910 --> 13:33.180
Couldn't have rigged that to
be any closer, could we, luv?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.780
What the hell just happened?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.150
I work for the Special
Reconnaissance Regiment.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.190
We intercepted a communiqué
that someone was offering

13:42.190 --> 13:43.620
a handsome bounty for your head.

13:43.630 --> 13:47.330
When I saw your name, I came calling.

13:47.330 --> 13:48.760
We need to get out of here.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.500
Sorry. How do you know my name?

13:50.500 --> 13:52.470
You're Kate Kane's ex, right?

13:52.470 --> 13:55.870
Well, so am I. Julia
Pennyworth. How do you do?

13:55.870 --> 13:57.630
And I'm happy to tell
you everything I know,

13:57.640 --> 14:00.640
but... agh... can we
deal with this first?

14:05.380 --> 14:07.210
You sure you don't want any?

14:07.220 --> 14:09.620
Positive.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.050
Hmm. More for me.

14:12.050 --> 14:15.720
Are you trying to draw attention?

14:15.720 --> 14:19.630
Who me? Ohh!

14:19.630 --> 14:22.130
Hmm.

14:22.130 --> 14:23.830
- Want to try?
- Nope.

14:27.870 --> 14:31.300
It's really fun. Hmm?

14:31.310 --> 14:33.280
Because you can't,

14:33.280 --> 14:35.010
and you don't want to admit that

14:35.010 --> 14:37.210
I'm better at something than you.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.850
Exactly, Alice.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.520
Nurse Tammy!

14:41.520 --> 14:44.130
- He's here.
- Oh, my poor Mouse.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.720
Get the adrenaline.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.920
Nurse Tammy!

14:47.920 --> 14:50.160
Help me.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.330
What are they doing here?

14:58.330 --> 15:00.200
- Did you call them?
- No?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.360
- Do not lie to me.
- When would I have called them?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.800
I have literally not left your sight.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.270
- Get out of my way.
- Alice, stop it.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.540
You go out there, they
will shoot you, too.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.180
- Don't you move!
- Hands in the air!

15:25.930 --> 15:27.530
Take him to Arkham.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.200
How did they know he was here?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.630
I called The Crows.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.120
All that time spent
working in the asylum,

15:34.120 --> 15:37.240
you think I can't spot someone
who's telling me a story.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.740
Crows. Open up!

15:51.060 --> 15:54.130
There he was in our
grasp, yanked away by might,

15:55.870 --> 16:00.560
but what's lost is not gone.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.860
Whatever this is, I want
nothing to do with it.

16:03.870 --> 16:06.130
When I was under the
influence of Fear Toxin,

16:06.140 --> 16:11.440
of all the horrible
things I experienced,

16:11.440 --> 16:14.810
the worst was being left behind...

16:14.810 --> 16:16.580
by you.

16:16.580 --> 16:20.750
I cannot sleep at night
knowing I left Mouse behind,

16:20.750 --> 16:24.320
locked in a cell.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.750
You want to break him out.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.060
Yes, and you are going to help me.

16:30.060 --> 16:31.280
We just took out an old lady.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.630
I'm pretty sure that
sister bonding time is over.

16:33.630 --> 16:35.630
Aw. It'll be a breeze.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.150
When Mouse escaped last year,

16:37.160 --> 16:41.100
he showed me all the ways
in and out of this place.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.000
Sounds like you already have a plan,

16:43.010 --> 16:45.140
so why do you need me?

16:45.140 --> 16:49.610
As a recent escapee, Mouse
will be deemed high risk.

16:49.610 --> 16:52.280
Protocol will demand that he be confined

16:52.280 --> 16:56.350
to the most secure area, the basement,

16:56.350 --> 16:59.490
far away form the other inmates,

16:59.490 --> 17:03.690
where your screams echo
against the walls until one day

17:03.690 --> 17:05.960
they become a friend screaming back.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.160
Please no, no, no, no. Come on.

17:09.170 --> 17:11.200
Welcome back, Johnny.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.470
We missed you.

17:13.470 --> 17:17.440
I look forward to, uh,
resuming your therapy.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.010
Please... not that again.

17:21.010 --> 17:23.510
Oh, no, no. Shh.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.870
There will be no escape for Mouse.

17:29.870 --> 17:32.220
Access to his cell requires two keys.

17:32.220 --> 17:35.890
The first is in the
possession of Dr. Butler.

17:35.890 --> 17:38.190
The other stays with
the head of security.

17:46.370 --> 17:48.340
Which is why you need me...

17:48.340 --> 17:51.810
two keys, two different places.

17:51.810 --> 17:55.210
Two people. You and me, sis!

17:55.210 --> 17:57.850
Helping you find Mouse so
that you could leave Gotham

17:57.850 --> 17:59.810
is one thing.

17:59.820 --> 18:01.480
You're talking about breaking into

18:01.480 --> 18:03.420
a high-security psychiatric facility,

18:03.420 --> 18:06.150
distracting the guards,
skirting the medical staff...

18:06.160 --> 18:07.690
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, and, uh, freeing

18:07.690 --> 18:09.560
a wanted killer from captivity.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.160
Is that so insane?

18:11.160 --> 18:13.060
I'm pretty sure it's the definition.

18:13.060 --> 18:15.860
"How fond she is at
finding morals in things".

18:15.870 --> 18:17.770
Have to draw the line somewhere.

18:17.770 --> 18:19.670
Yeah, but who arbitrarily decides

18:19.670 --> 18:22.870
when and where those
lines are drawn? You?

18:22.870 --> 18:25.520
Mouse is in custody. If I were to
help you break him out of there,

18:25.520 --> 18:27.070
then how am I any better?

18:27.080 --> 18:30.010
Don't you get it by now?

18:30.010 --> 18:31.580
You're not!

18:31.580 --> 18:32.880
I'm not a criminal.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.420
Ah, ha ha ha!

18:35.420 --> 18:38.050
And they say I'm the delusional one.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.920
Here we are, two killers ourselves

18:40.920 --> 18:46.260
out and about by the
mercy of sweet, old daddy.

18:46.260 --> 18:49.430
We aren't that different.

18:49.430 --> 18:53.070
I never... planned
on hurting Cartwright.

18:53.070 --> 18:56.300
But I did. Heh heh heh.

18:56.310 --> 18:59.070
See, I could have easily
killed him myself

18:59.080 --> 19:01.240
and let you go on being the city's

19:01.240 --> 19:04.450
symbol of hope...

19:04.450 --> 19:07.820
But it was time for you
to see that you and I

19:07.820 --> 19:10.250
are one and the same.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.320
You wanted this.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.590
You left Cartwright for me to find.

19:17.590 --> 19:21.330
You wanted me to hear your story.

19:21.330 --> 19:23.330
You wanted to push me over the edge.

19:26.940 --> 19:28.900
You set me up to kill him

19:28.910 --> 19:31.470
so that I would be like you.

19:31.470 --> 19:35.280
Kate, you can't give me all the credit.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.310
After all, it wasn't that hard. Ha ha!

19:38.310 --> 19:40.110
Aah!

19:40.120 --> 19:42.580
Unh!

19:48.920 --> 19:51.760
You gonna kill me now, too?

19:51.760 --> 19:53.160
Aah!

19:57.330 --> 20:00.470
The court has reviewed
the defendant's case.

20:00.470 --> 20:02.370
It's gonna be okay.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.610
Judge Calverick has
already signed a statement

20:08.610 --> 20:11.070
indicating he cut
corners in order to close

20:11.080 --> 20:14.180
the high-profile murder of Lucius Fox.

20:14.180 --> 20:17.950
That along with the defendant's
claims of a coerced confession

20:17.950 --> 20:20.020
at the hands of a corrupt cop

20:20.020 --> 20:22.390
leads the court to
believe that the defendant

20:22.390 --> 20:25.730
has a basis for a retrial.

20:25.730 --> 20:27.390
No way.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.800
The state has the
right to retry the case

20:30.800 --> 20:32.670
at the D.A.'s discretion.

20:32.670 --> 20:36.370
Until then, the defendant
is free of his own volition.

20:36.370 --> 20:37.910
This court is adjourned.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.880
We're gonna fight this.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.350
This is not over, okay?

20:48.380 --> 20:49.820
I know.

20:55.690 --> 20:57.420
"Battle not with monsters,

20:57.430 --> 20:59.430
lest you become a monster".

21:01.600 --> 21:07.030
I'm afraid that passage wasn't in
the one book I was allowed to read.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.240
Someone once said it to me.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.670
How did that work out?

21:14.040 --> 21:15.680
He became a monster.

21:26.450 --> 21:29.120
I know I've made light of things...

21:31.460 --> 21:34.190
but I owe you a thank you.

21:36.530 --> 21:38.930
Thank you for killing the man

21:38.940 --> 21:42.870
who destroyed my life,

21:42.870 --> 21:44.910
destroyed our family.

21:47.250 --> 21:51.760
Do not feel guilty for what you did.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.150
I... I don't.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.660
The only thing I feel guilty about...

22:04.930 --> 22:06.760
is I don't feel guilty.

22:16.070 --> 22:18.910
So now you're scared you're becoming me.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.850
Isn't that what you wanted?

22:31.790 --> 22:34.590
Would that really be so awful?

22:43.500 --> 22:46.470
I'll do it. I'll do it.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.010
I'll reunite you with Mouse...

22:55.140 --> 22:59.450
But I... I need to be able to trust you.

22:59.450 --> 23:02.280
Okay.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.150
Say it.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.020
You can trust me, Kate.

23:09.030 --> 23:11.890
No one dies in the process.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.000
Kate, have I ever lied to you?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.670
Literally dozens of times.

23:18.670 --> 23:21.070
Yeah, okay.

23:21.070 --> 23:24.710
I promise...

23:24.710 --> 23:28.310
No... one...

23:28.310 --> 23:29.840
will die.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.420
You can trust me.

23:49.730 --> 23:51.700
What's this?

23:51.700 --> 23:54.120
Well, we're breaking
a killer out of Arkham,

23:54.120 --> 23:57.890
so you can't exactly go in
disguised as a flying rodent.

24:22.390 --> 24:23.690
I.D., please.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.540
Code Black.

24:32.540 --> 24:34.710
Repeat. Code Black!

24:34.710 --> 24:36.440
Hands where I can see them.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.380
- What's going on?
- Possible incendiary device

24:38.380 --> 24:39.640
at the main gate.

24:39.650 --> 24:41.880
Slowly exit the vehicle now.

24:46.220 --> 24:48.890
That should be the guards
responding to our little decoy.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.520
Alice, if they shoot that driver...

24:50.520 --> 24:52.620
Oh, relax. He drives a linen truck.

24:52.630 --> 24:54.590
Guards finding a fake bomb on the axel

24:54.590 --> 24:57.100
will be the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to him.

24:57.100 --> 25:00.930
Well, that should take us up
to the maximum security wing.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.300
Oh.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.240
Don't forget this.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.800
Once we pop the cork on this bunny,

25:06.810 --> 25:08.280
things are going to get...

25:08.280 --> 25:09.780
♪ Ca-razy. ♪

25:30.660 --> 25:31.930
Agh!

25:36.800 --> 25:38.140
We're clear.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.280
I'll get the keys from Dr. Butler.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.340
And I'll get the keys
from the head guard.

25:46.350 --> 25:49.210
Wait.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.350
Remember your promise.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.050
No killing.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.350
You can trust me.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.730
The doctor's not in,

26:02.730 --> 26:05.900
so... you get me.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.340
- Ahh!
- Careful.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.280
I can take a hit, luv,
but it's the cleanup

26:13.280 --> 26:15.840
after that I've never been good with.

26:15.840 --> 26:20.310
This is probably a good
time for me to say thank you.

26:20.310 --> 26:21.980
Ah. Comes with the paycheck.

26:26.020 --> 26:28.020
Uh, hi.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.750
Mary, hey. We could use your help.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.590
Oh, my God.

26:35.930 --> 26:39.110
I've met you before. You're Kate's...

26:39.110 --> 26:41.530
Ex. I know. We covered that.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.500
Uh...

26:43.500 --> 26:46.400
I was gonna say assistant,
but that's much more fun.

26:46.410 --> 26:47.940
Julia will suffice.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.710
British intelligence. SRR.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.280
Julia took a bullet
that was meant for me,

26:53.280 --> 26:56.110
which leaves the question
who wants me dead?

26:56.120 --> 26:57.720
Who was the other vic?

26:57.720 --> 27:01.420
Witness in a case. Alia Nazari.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.420
Someone's cleaning up their tracks.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.890
I have not seen outside of a building

27:07.890 --> 27:11.700
in the longest time, Grandma.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.100
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.270
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah.

27:14.270 --> 27:15.730
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah.

27:15.740 --> 27:18.140
Aw. You know I'm gonna
eat them all, too.

27:18.140 --> 27:19.470
You know I am.

27:22.970 --> 27:25.080
I'll wash the dishes.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.710
I... I will do whatever.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.090
Go on inside. I'll be right in.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.300
You murdered my father.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.500
I didn't.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.730
I am sorry somebody did.

27:50.740 --> 27:51.940
Your pops seemed like a good guy.

27:51.940 --> 27:54.170
Don't... don't do that.

27:54.170 --> 27:57.680
Don't act like you knew the
first thing about my dad.

27:57.680 --> 28:01.180
I know he was proud of you...

28:01.180 --> 28:02.510
getting into MIT.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.620
How the hell did you know that?

28:12.630 --> 28:17.190
You kidding? Your pops
wouldn't shut up about it.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.930
Told everybody in the store that night.

28:19.930 --> 28:25.100
"My son Lukas is gonna change the world.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.300
You heard it here first".

28:32.210 --> 28:34.710
Then why'd you kill him, man?

28:34.710 --> 28:40.520
The truth is, I went into a
Sip & Dash for a bag of chips,

28:40.520 --> 28:42.890
woke up with a gun in my hand

28:42.890 --> 28:45.360
and your dad's...

28:45.360 --> 28:48.230
your dad's blood all over me.

28:48.230 --> 28:52.700
Look at me. Tats, dreads, record.

28:52.700 --> 28:56.330
Of course, I'm gonna convince
a jury I killed Lucius Fox.

28:56.340 --> 28:58.490
I was the winning lottery ticket

28:58.500 --> 29:02.310
for a bunch of punks who needed
to keep their own ass out of jail.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.550
Hey, Reggie.

29:16.350 --> 29:19.260
Help! Help!

29:47.480 --> 29:49.680
Oh! Uh...

29:51.760 --> 29:54.500
Dr. Butler I presume.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.870
You're supposed to be dead.

29:58.170 --> 30:00.430
You know, it's funny how this place

30:00.430 --> 30:02.210
can make people feel like they're

30:02.210 --> 30:05.210
losing their minds. Heh.

30:05.210 --> 30:07.950
Even you, doctor.

30:07.950 --> 30:11.450
Uh, w-w-what do you want?

30:11.450 --> 30:15.920
I have long dreamed of meeting you,

30:15.920 --> 30:20.260
repaying you for all the pain

30:20.260 --> 30:22.560
you inflicted on a...

30:22.560 --> 30:24.600
dear friend.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.030
One...

30:26.030 --> 30:30.030
quick... swipe,

30:30.040 --> 30:32.070
another name off my list.

30:35.270 --> 30:36.440
Ohh!

30:37.940 --> 30:39.910
But a promise is a promise.

30:39.910 --> 30:41.910
Now where are your keys?

31:06.810 --> 31:08.510
Thank you.

31:13.650 --> 31:15.910
Ahh.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.350
You'll live.

31:20.820 --> 31:22.020
Agh!

32:16.480 --> 32:18.310
Alice, knife!

32:21.550 --> 32:23.310
Aah!

32:30.720 --> 32:32.360
Guess you do know how to use it.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.220
Mouse...

32:57.220 --> 32:59.950
It's me.

32:59.950 --> 33:03.050
- Alice?
- Heh.

33:03.060 --> 33:04.920
What are you doing here?

33:04.920 --> 33:07.930
You know I'd never leave you behind.

33:07.930 --> 33:12.960
Wow. Didn't take any chances.

33:12.970 --> 33:14.730
Why are there so many straps?

33:14.730 --> 33:17.540
Kate, help me.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.280
What are you doing? Open the door!

33:30.250 --> 33:32.780
Open the door.

33:32.790 --> 33:34.590
I can't do that, Alice.

33:41.790 --> 33:44.900
You... you promised.

33:44.900 --> 33:48.270
I promised to reunite you with Mouse.

33:48.270 --> 33:50.230
You wanted to be with your brother.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.000
Now you are.

33:52.010 --> 33:54.110
Why did you trust her?

33:59.510 --> 34:02.480
It's over, Alice.

34:02.480 --> 34:06.150
You can't hurt anyone anymore.

34:06.150 --> 34:08.949
Me?

34:08.960 --> 34:10.860
Me?!

34:10.860 --> 34:14.790
You are no better than me!

34:14.790 --> 34:17.429
And you?

34:17.429 --> 34:20.280
You and I are the same person!

34:20.280 --> 34:22.969
We are no different!

34:22.969 --> 34:24.969
Let's get out of here.

34:24.969 --> 34:28.639
No. No, no, no, no.

34:28.639 --> 34:31.510
No. No. No, no, no, no.

34:31.510 --> 34:33.880
Kate, don't leave me.

34:33.880 --> 34:36.310
No. Don't leave me. No, no, no, no.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.980
No, Kate, no. No! No!

34:39.989 --> 34:43.050
No! No, no, no no!

34:43.060 --> 34:45.659
No, Kate! Don't leave me!

34:45.659 --> 34:47.860
Don't leave me!

34:47.860 --> 34:49.230
Don't leave me!

34:49.230 --> 34:52.560
Don't leave! Kate! Kate!

34:52.570 --> 34:55.630
Don't leave me! No!

35:07.670 --> 35:11.500
Arkham officials have her in
isolation on 24-hour watch.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.210
Getting her to trust you, alerting me,

35:16.210 --> 35:19.080
helping your city wasn't easy.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.280
Took a hell of a lot of courage.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.980
It had to be done, and I
had to be the one to do it.

35:24.990 --> 35:29.990
I, um... I moved the body.

35:29.990 --> 35:33.460
She can't threaten us anymore.

35:33.460 --> 35:36.700
It's time to put Alice behind us.

35:42.170 --> 35:43.640
Kiddo?

36:08.300 --> 36:12.400
Oh, my God. Luke. Are you hurt?

36:12.400 --> 36:14.030
Let me take a look at you.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.640
It's Reggie's.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.470
What do you mean it's Reggie's?

36:17.470 --> 36:19.310
I went to go confront him,

36:19.310 --> 36:21.010
but someone shot him.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.180
- Who?
- I don't... I didn't see.

36:23.180 --> 36:27.850
Uh, GCPD thinks it was
a hit, professional.

36:27.850 --> 36:32.150
Reggie gets shot the day he
gets released from prison.

36:32.150 --> 36:35.190
Earlier today, Alia Nazari was shot.

36:35.190 --> 36:37.310
- Who?
- The woman who owned

36:37.310 --> 36:39.760
the Sip & Dash where
your father was killed.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.930
It was a professional hit, too.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.070
Why would anybody want to kill her?

36:47.070 --> 36:49.870
Nazari obviously knew
something that someone

36:49.870 --> 36:52.770
didn't want her to spill.

36:52.770 --> 36:55.680
Luke...

36:55.680 --> 37:00.510
I think there's a chance that
Reggie didn't kill your father.

37:02.070 --> 37:05.390
Yeah. After everything
that's happened today, I...

37:05.390 --> 37:07.420
I don't really know what to believe.

37:07.420 --> 37:11.220
But if Reggie was set up...

37:11.230 --> 37:13.860
Then my dad's killer's still out there.

37:20.900 --> 37:23.850
Reggie Harris's freedom
was short-lived today

37:23.850 --> 37:26.170
when he was gunned
down outside of his home

37:26.170 --> 37:29.110
just a handful of hours after
he was released from prison.

37:29.110 --> 37:32.260
Harris, who had previously
been convicted of manslaughter,

37:32.270 --> 37:34.280
had long proclaimed his innocence.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.950
His case was currently awaiting...

37:35.950 --> 37:39.790
No frills but no questions either.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.220
We'll be safe here.

37:42.220 --> 37:43.920
Guy claims he was set up for murder,

37:43.930 --> 37:45.990
then gets killed the day of his release.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.630
Well, that's not a coincidence.

37:47.630 --> 37:49.230
This cover-up I've been looking into,

37:49.230 --> 37:53.170
it's centered around
Lucius Fox's murder.

37:53.170 --> 37:57.770
- Lucius Fox?
- Know him?

37:57.770 --> 37:59.310
He was my godfather.

38:01.180 --> 38:03.740
We'll figure out who's behind this.

38:06.610 --> 38:09.780
Where are you going?

38:09.780 --> 38:11.680
I need to check on Luke.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.630
Calling from a burner phone.

38:23.630 --> 38:25.470
Never a good sign.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.130
You were right about The Crows,

38:27.140 --> 38:29.500
but it goes beyond
tampering with evidence.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.500
Someone took out two people today,

38:31.510 --> 38:34.040
and they put a hit out on me, too.

38:50.190 --> 38:51.490
Agh!

39:04.670 --> 39:06.410
Who hired you?

39:33.030 --> 39:35.600
Someone's aiming to see double tonight.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.840
Didn't realize you were in town.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.510
Came by to check on Luke,

39:39.510 --> 39:41.160
saw you out here,

39:41.160 --> 39:43.540
but it looks like I've
walked in on a party of one.

39:43.550 --> 39:46.210
I'd like to keep it that
way if you don't mind.

39:46.210 --> 39:51.050
Sorry, luv. I do.

39:51.050 --> 39:52.320
You don't have to say anything,

39:52.320 --> 39:55.220
but a friend wouldn't leave you drinking

39:55.220 --> 39:56.720
on a ledge.

40:06.130 --> 40:09.440
I'm not the hero the city thinks I am.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.100
I betrayed my sister today.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.210
I put her in Arkham.

40:15.210 --> 40:17.580
What compelled that?

40:17.580 --> 40:22.250
I felt myself becoming her.

40:22.250 --> 40:25.590
I killed someone, buried him,

40:25.590 --> 40:29.460
didn't feel an ounce of remorse.

40:33.290 --> 40:36.060
I don't know who I am right now.

40:39.930 --> 40:43.100
But I do know that I do
not want to be my sister.

40:47.910 --> 40:52.180
You... are nothing like your sister.

41:26.810 --> 41:29.820
"'It was a glorious victory, wasn't it?'

41:29.820 --> 41:32.550
said the White Knight.

41:32.550 --> 41:36.960
'I don't know', Alice said doubtfully.

41:36.960 --> 41:40.890
'I don't want to be
anybody's prisoner.'"

41:45.500 --> 41:48.230
'I want to be a Queen.'"

41:50.700 --> 42:24.000
