00:00.267 --> 00:03.035
         <i> - Papa, papa,</i>
         <i> come in here!</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:05.004
      - Hey, papa's here.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.772
     - Papa, i'm so scared.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.207
There's a monster in my closet.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.341
                    - Oh, buddy.
                            Shh.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.076
            It's okay, i'm here.

00:11.078 --> 00:13.078
          Monster's aren't real,
              my little pierogi.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.147
        - But i saw it.
     It was big and hairy.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.448
                  - You just had
             a nightmare, buddy.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.616
       - No, it was real!

00:17.618 --> 00:19.218
    - I'm sure it felt that way.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.454
             But i am gonna open
                    this closet,

00:22.456 --> 00:25.257
     And i'm gonna show you
 that there's nothing in there.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.458
     - Don't do that, papa!

00:26.460 --> 00:30.229
          See? Nothing--

00:30.231 --> 00:31.363
              whoo!

00:31.365 --> 00:33.399
                 ah, hey, chuck.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.400
                   It's pimento.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.388
     - And now nikolaj says
      he's too frightened

00:56.390 --> 00:58.424
      To ever sleep again,
   so that's just superduper.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.659
- I don't understand
what he's so scared about.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.128
If i was there to kill him,
he never would've heard me.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.462
     - A thing you told him
         several times.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.466
        - God, nikolaj is having
          such a rich childhood.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.851
       - Can we back up?

01:08.852 --> 01:10.235
      What were you doing
       in boyle's closet

01:10.237 --> 01:11.670
      In the first place?
   - Well, i still had a key

01:11.672 --> 01:13.605
From when i was crashing there
last year, and i wanted

01:13.607 --> 01:16.108
To shower and anoint my body
with essential oils

01:16.110 --> 01:17.609
Before i saw rosa.
Duh.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.411
          - Well, she's gonna be
    so psyched that you're back.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.146
     - Where have you been
         all this time?

01:21.148 --> 01:22.648
   Figgis has been locked up
          for a month.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.650
- I was in prison
in uzbekistan.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.385
It's actually not as bad
as it sounds.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.488
       - I deserve this!

01:29.490 --> 01:31.307
         - Why were you in jail?

01:31.308 --> 01:33.125
- Ah, i got shot down smuggling
ammo to a rebel group,

01:33.127 --> 01:34.693
Flying an old soviet prop plane.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.861
They tortured us.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.429
Made me eat
my co-pilot's tongue.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.298
Oof, now i've
got a taste for it.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.432
        - The important thing is
           you're safe and sound

01:40.434 --> 01:42.434
           And back in brooklyn.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.469
     - Thank you, captain.

01:45.473 --> 01:48.440
      Ooh, you smell good!
             Wowza.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.442
       - And end of hug.
            - Okay.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.643
                - I'll see about
          getting you reinstated

01:51.645 --> 01:53.312
    To the nypd immediately.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.713
    - I think this deserves
          another hug.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.381
           - Me too.
            - Nope.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.150
      One was sufficient.
            - Cool.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.418
 - Pimento, you son of a bitch!

01:59.420 --> 02:00.719
  - You're the son of a bitch!

02:00.721 --> 02:02.187
        - Oh, we'll see
    who's a son of a bitch.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.389
      - Oh, yes, we will.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.424
               aww.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.693
         It's so sweet.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.362
          and violent.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.331
        - Yeah, this is awkward.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.399
  I'm sure they'll stop soon.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.735
          - And it's escalating.
                       Let's go.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.470
       - I left my phone
     in the briefing room.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.405
     It's been 20 minutes.
   You think they're still--

02:20.407 --> 02:21.640
   - They're not doing anything.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.308
 Kissing just turned into talk.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.910
 It's like, why even work here?

02:24.912 --> 02:27.212
                    - Listen up!
We have an announcement to make.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.413
                 - When i was in
              that uzbek prison,

02:28.415 --> 02:29.915
         Choking on my own blood

02:29.917 --> 02:31.750
                 Because my face
            was being beaten in,

02:31.752 --> 02:34.186
                     I realized,
                  life is funny!

02:34.188 --> 02:35.354
  - That's what you realized?

02:35.356 --> 02:36.388
           - Mm-hmm.
       - And it's short.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.489
        We're picking up
       where we left off

02:37.491 --> 02:38.991
 When adrian went into hiding.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.492
We're getting married tomorrow.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.361
          - Tomorrow.
       That's real quick.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.462
             - Thank you, sarge.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.297
                  And we want it
                to be beautiful,

02:45.299 --> 02:47.499
         And lush, and romantic,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.301
 Just like a nancy meyers movie.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.402
 - She's our favorite director.
             - Aw.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.637
   I love "you've got mail."

02:51.639 --> 02:53.639
- That's nora ephron, you idiot.
           - I know.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.407
- Wait, hold up.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.376
Planning a wedding like that
in 14 hours would be

02:57.378 --> 03:00.379
The greatest organizational
challenge in history.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.446
How are you gonna do it?

03:01.448 --> 03:03.215
- I was kinda hoping you would.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.416
   - I thought i was supposed
        to get you guys

03:04.418 --> 03:06.251
      The wedding present!

03:06.253 --> 03:07.519
       Of course i will!
       - That's my girl.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.654
           all right.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.222
       Listen up, people.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.657
       The next 14 hours
       are gonna be hell,

03:11.659 --> 03:13.492
                  But in the end
  you will have the satisfaction

03:13.494 --> 03:15.394
 Of knowing that you've finally
   done something worthwhile

03:15.396 --> 03:16.662
        With your lives.
        - I kinda think

03:16.664 --> 03:18.964
    The police work we do--
          - eh-eh-eh!

03:18.965 --> 03:21.265
  I don't have time to stroke
    your damn ego, sergeant.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.467
     Let's make a wedding!

03:24.405 --> 03:25.771
                    - Hey, jake.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.306
         I need a wedding favor.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.858
          - Of course.
           Anything.

03:28.859 --> 03:30.409
    Except killing someone,
      or maiming someone,

03:30.411 --> 03:32.211
Or breaking the law in any way,
           or nudity.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.679
  Also i don't like waking up
  super early in the morning--

03:33.681 --> 03:35.231
    You know what, why don't
you just tell me what you want?

03:35.232 --> 03:36.782
            - Cool, i need to go
        to neustadter, new york.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.218
          I gotta pick up a pair
       of ruby earrings i pawned

03:39.220 --> 03:40.319
      Before i went into hiding.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.687
      - Neustadter's like
        six hours away.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.522
     I'm not so sure we can
  get there and back in time.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.457
      - Jake, there's no wedding
           without the earrings.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.326
        My grandmother wore them
             on her wedding day,

03:47.328 --> 03:48.694
And said they blessed her union.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.662
          Do you want this union
            to be blessed, jake?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.232
       Or do you want this union
       to be friggin' unblessed?

03:53.234 --> 03:55.300
  - Blessed, totally blessed.
     I'll do it, it's fine.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.735
     But i should warn you,
   my car is a piece of junk

03:56.737 --> 03:58.437
 And it's always breaking down.
         - Ah, come on!

03:58.439 --> 04:00.672
        The universe isn't gonna
         let anything bad happen

04:00.674 --> 04:03.709
          To two best friends...
  Unless we're in a fiery crash,

04:03.711 --> 04:06.278
       And our bodies are burned
             beyond recognition.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.347
    Ooh, gina's got jelly beans!

04:08.349 --> 04:10.015
- Pimento, no.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.516
              Bad.
         - Sorry, gina.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.719
             - That was amazing.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.454
     He actually listens to you.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.822
            Hey, you should come
           with us on this trip.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.023
               You know, in case
              he starts acting--

04:18.024 --> 04:19.690
    - Bat crap loony tunes.
             - Yes.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.360
         You can use your powers
           to keep him in check.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.694
    - Yeah, people fear me.
             - Mm.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.796
       - The only reason
  i'm not your boss right now

04:24.798 --> 04:26.498
       Is 'cause i'd hate
      to do that to holt.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.500
         He needs this.
  - And also you're not a cop.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.836
- Well, you're not the basis
of a character on "empire,"

04:30.838 --> 04:33.405
Jake, but i don't throw that
in your face every damn day.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.840
  - So you will come with us?
     - Yeah, i'll be there.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.375
         - You da man!
          - Bye, girl!

04:36.377 --> 04:38.277
      - See ya in the car, girl.

04:38.279 --> 04:40.379
            - Okay.
     First, the good news.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.481
   I've generated a detailed
      timeline broken down

04:42.483 --> 04:44.850
   Into 30-second increments
      to keep us on track.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.753
         The bad news:
 We're already 16.5 increments

04:47.755 --> 04:49.454
        Behind schedule.
           - Oh, man.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.789
    Terry feels overwhelmed.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.591
                         - Good!
                         Use it!

04:52.592 --> 04:54.392
 Neil armstrong was overwhelmed
  when he walked on the moon,

04:54.395 --> 04:55.460
   But you know what he did?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.728
     He walked on the moon!

04:56.730 --> 04:58.363
   Charles, you're in charge
            of food.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.731
- I've been planning
a nuptial menu

04:59.733 --> 05:01.500
Since the day i met genevieve.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.770
Warning, it will be delicious
and highly erotic.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.706
- Your menu is not gonna involve
animal genitalia, is it?

05:07.708 --> 05:11.410
   - No, i was gonna make...
           Not that.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.778
                        - Terry,
      you're on hair and makeup.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.779
                  I've seen your
         little girls' pigtails,

05:13.781 --> 05:15.380
        So i know you can do it.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.482
- They actually prefer
my hair work to their mommy's.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.386
i love their little heads.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.322
   terry, what's going on, man?

05:23.324 --> 05:25.324
  - It's just a matter of time
  before i'm doing their hair

05:25.326 --> 05:26.425
       At their weddings.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.493
        It goes so fast.
     They're still babies!

05:28.495 --> 05:29.861
   - Pull it together, jeffords!

05:29.863 --> 05:31.697
     Scully and hitchcock,
  you're in charge of seating.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.465
              - Smart move, amy.
                I've been called

05:33.467 --> 05:35.334
           The leonardo da vinci
           of sitting on my ass.

05:35.336 --> 05:36.602
                        - Great.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.869
         And, captain,
   you can help me decorate.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.738
- I'm at your disposal,
just tell me what to do.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.473
I'm here to implement
your vision.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.442
           - Well, we just wanna
                 keep it classy.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.743
- Got it.
Balloon arch.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.478
            - What?
   - Say no more, it's done.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.814
     I'm off to the nearest
         balloon store.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.482
         - Okay, rosa.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.484
     You go to the office,
    have a couple bellinis,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.419
        And just relax.
      - What's a bellini?

05:54.421 --> 05:55.754
    - Peach juice and champagne.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.422
- Peach juice and champagne?
What am i, six?

05:57.424 --> 05:59.458
           come on, just try it.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.892
          It's what nancy meyers
                    would drink.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.562
- Fine.
For nancy.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.731
                  - So, big day.
         How you feeling, buddy?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.532
Good, giddy.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.934
I've never felt giddy before.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.569
Didn't realize how close
it was to hungry.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.203
       - You know, it's possible
             you're just hungry.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.837
 When's the last time you ate?
     - Uh, three days ago?

06:13.841 --> 06:15.574
             - Ah.
- You excited for being married?

06:15.576 --> 06:17.509
- Yeah!
I love rosa.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.911
I can't wait to just jam
my tongue in her earholes,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.480
And eat the hair off her head.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.382
        Hoo! I'm giddy.
       - Aw, that's cute.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.384
      - All right, we're looking
           for 381 smith street.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.936
           It should be up here.

06:26.937 --> 06:28.487
       Hopefully they still have
                  your earrings.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.489
    - You sure we're looking
            for 381?

06:30.491 --> 06:33.992
      'cause 381's looking
        a little crispy.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.861
           - Oh, no.
        It burned down.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.663
      How did this happen?

06:37.664 --> 06:39.464
                - Uh, it's okay.
     Everything's gonna be fine.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.465
       We'll think of something,
                      all right?

06:40.467 --> 06:41.500
- Nope!

06:41.502 --> 06:43.969
This is a sign
from the universe.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.871
I can't marry rosa.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.973
Guys, the wedding's off.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.647
           That's it!
   We're not getting married.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.249
      This is a disaster.
           - Come on.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.850
  I mean, they're just earrings,
                          right?

06:58.851 --> 07:00.451
        We can get another pair,
 or we could make some new ones.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.720
           All we need is, like,
                   a blacksmith.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.755
      Or a smelter--a smelt man.
            That can't be right.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.190
                    The point is
          you can still married.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.625
- No, jake.
You don't understand.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.593
The universe is
sending me a sign.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.495
And when the universe talks,
i listen!

07:10.497 --> 07:12.664
 - Well, i personally don't even
  really believe in signs, so...

07:12.666 --> 07:14.666
- What?
Then you deserve to die.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.084
            - Ah...
      - The sign was real.

07:16.085 --> 07:17.501
If i ignore it
and marry rosa anyway,

07:17.504 --> 07:19.838
I'm basically asking the
universe to stomp on my balls.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.206
             - Okay, good point.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.641
                      Hey, gina,
     i could use your help here.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.142
                 You wanna maybe
           weigh in on this one?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.677
         - Yeah, sure.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.211
         You're right.
    The marriage is cursed.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.547
                     - What? No!
           You weighed in wrong.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.582
       - I'm sorry, jake,
         it's an omen.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.616
  And i'm not taking your side
    against the universe's.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.619
   It's hundred of years old.
 - What if there was something

07:34.621 --> 07:36.088
In the universe that could prove
                 to you that you

07:36.089 --> 07:37.556
       Should still get married?
             What would that be?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.391
         - Finding his
      grandma's earrings.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.225
Or we could cut rosa's ears off,
       and then it's like

07:41.228 --> 07:42.661
          The earrings
     don't even make sense.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.563
          - Thank you!
   Someone's trying to help.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.697
- Okay,
so the earrings.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.698
      Maybe somebody bought them

07:46.699 --> 07:47.698
   Before the place burned down,
                          right?

07:47.701 --> 07:48.767
        We could track 'em down.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.536
                And lookee here.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.705
    I just got the owner's name.
             That's good, right?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.707
     - Okay, maybe there is
     a little bit of hope.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.542
     you're damn right there is.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.077
              Suck it, universe!

07:59.078 --> 08:00.611
        - Are you crazy?
 - Why would you even say that?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.614
- Come on, man!

08:02.616 --> 08:03.849
    - How are the chairs coming,
                           guys?

08:03.851 --> 08:04.850
- Shh.
We're working!

08:04.852 --> 08:06.585
       - This one's good.
            - Okay.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.253
   So we'll go with that one?
   - No, i said it was good.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.972
   I didn't say it was right.

08:09.973 --> 08:11.690
   - Wow, you're taking this
       really seriously.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.558
                          - Amy,
     will you taste this batter?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.494
           - Mm-hmm.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.562
Hmm...
I think it's a little off.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.864
          - You know what's off?
                     Your mouth!

08:18.866 --> 08:21.600
Why jake lets your stupid tongue
              anywhere near him,

08:21.602 --> 08:23.201
                I'll never know.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.270
       Nope, i forgot the sugar.
                   That's on me.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.674
         - Whoa, you really made
               the balloon arch.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.577
          - Made? No.
         I birthed her.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.746
 There's no form more graceful
         than the arch,

08:34.748 --> 08:37.549
    No object more whimsical
       than the balloon.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.552
- Yes, you and i think that,
but...

08:40.554 --> 08:42.654
     What will rosa think?

08:42.655 --> 08:44.289
         - Good point.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.858
    Rosa would want a much,
   much bigger balloon arch.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.560
   Back to the balloon store.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.695
- Uh, amy?
We've got a problem.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.564
            - What?
        - Rosa's drunk.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.533
                         - Rosa?
                        No. How?

08:54.535 --> 08:56.585
- Bellinis rule!

08:56.586 --> 08:58.636
Nancy meyers, you've done it
again, you saucy bitch.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.273
            - For the last time,
     i don't have your earrings.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.674
   They didn't survive the fire.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.743
- Aw, no,
this is really bad.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.212
    - Well, not necessarily.
   I mean, maybe the universe

09:07.214 --> 09:08.780
     Allowed something else
     to survive, you know?

09:08.782 --> 09:10.782
     Like a rabbit's foot.
 - I don't think you understand

09:10.784 --> 09:12.784
      How pawn shops work.
 - I don't think you understand

09:12.786 --> 09:13.818
         How they work.
       Yours burned down!

09:13.820 --> 09:15.320
          I'm so sorry
      you lost everything.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.789
   I'm just really worked up.
       No, please don't!

09:17.791 --> 09:19.791
          Okay, so...

09:19.793 --> 09:22.561
    I know that seemed like
  a little bit of a dead end.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.262
     she's got the earrings.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.664
          - She does?
   - She stole all the merch,

09:25.666 --> 09:27.666
 And then burned down the store.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.601
      She was wearing a necklace
       that i also pawned there.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.037
- Oh, snap!
Signs on signs on signs!

09:32.039 --> 09:33.572
         - Are you sure
    it's the same necklace?

09:33.574 --> 09:34.806
               - Uh, yeah, jake.
               I once punched it

09:34.808 --> 09:36.675
         Through a guy's throat,
              so i'm pretty sure

09:36.677 --> 09:38.343
         I remember it.
      - I stand corrected.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.811
           All right,
i'm gonna call the local police

09:39.812 --> 09:41.278
       And get a warrant.
      - Oh, don't bother.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.781
  Let's just kick down the door,
      and take back what's mine.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.683
       - No! No, no, no.
       That's a bad idea.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.618
- He's right.
Just use the lattice.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.852
The upstairs window's open.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.654
             - No!
            - Nice!

09:49.656 --> 09:50.889
     - What are you doing?
      - I'm trying to make

09:50.890 --> 09:52.123
      This wedding happen.
      What are you doing?

09:52.124 --> 09:53.357
             - Trying to keep us
                  out of prison.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.893
       You know what, forget it.
I'll just deal with him myself--

09:54.895 --> 09:56.361
 Nope, he's already on the roof.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.630
       - Aha! Yeah, dog!
       Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

09:58.632 --> 10:00.732
     - Rosa, what happened?
            - Sorry.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.367
I didn't know you could drunk
off champers.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.302
   I mean, it's half bubbles.
      - Don't worry, amy.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.371
I got this.
I'm a master at sobering up.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.039
        - Are you sure?
       - Uh, you don't go

10:08.041 --> 10:09.908
To the renaissance faire
every weekend in your 20s

10:09.910 --> 10:11.710
Without learning
how to handle your mead.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.811
                        - Great.
                Thanks, charles.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.813
- Mm-hmm.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.616
           - Charles,
   i'm getting married today.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.817
                 - Yes, you are.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.785
         And i'm gonna make sure
                   you are sober

10:20.787 --> 10:23.688
              When that happens.
  Now i just need cayenne pepper

10:23.690 --> 10:25.824
      And some horse milk.
    - Marriage is the best.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.926
Hey, how come you and genevieve
aren't married?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.128
              Huh?
            - Uh...

10:30.130 --> 10:32.097
  You know, it's complicated.
        - No, it's not.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.932
It's easy.
Bring her down here.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.134
     We'll all get married!
         - Yeah, right.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.837
     She doesn't want that.
     - Whoa, that sounds...

10:38.839 --> 10:40.805
     no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.341
                     No, no, no.
                  Uh-uh, no, no.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.876
     Everything's great with us.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.410
     I mean, if it was up to me,
               we'd get hitched,

10:46.413 --> 10:48.313
                     But she had
     a really bad divorce, so...

10:48.315 --> 10:50.415
- Oh, i'm sorry.
Does that upset you?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.417
                     - I'm good!
                 Yeah, i'm good!

10:52.419 --> 10:54.319
I'm so sad.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.754
I love her so much.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.422
I wanna marry her butt so bad.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.392
     - To genevieve's butt!
     - To genevieve's butt!

11:00.394 --> 11:03.161
    <i> -</i> Look at all this crap.
        See, i told you.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.097
They took all their merchandise,
    and burned their store.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.433
           - This is a bad idea.
            We should leave now.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.768
          - What? No.
       All we're gonna do

11:09.770 --> 11:11.553
     Is find the earrings,

11:11.554 --> 11:13.337
   And then light this place
      on fire for revenge.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.173
- Check it out!
Rainstick.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.675
          Keeping it.
       - No, you're not.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.376
        That is a crime.
           - Untrue.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.778
   Once you steal something,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.046
       None of your stuff
        belongs to you.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.380
     - I've heard that too.
       - No, you haven't.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.782
                     No one has.
                  Put that down.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.116
  Okay.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.851
                         - Gina!
            Be a quieter robber!

11:26.853 --> 11:29.120
- But you told me
to put it down.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.455
- Hi, we met earlier.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.157
- You're breaking into my house?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.426
   - Or are you breaking into
           our house?

11:34.428 --> 11:36.761
            - Yeah.
     - Dino! Robbers! Dino!

11:36.763 --> 11:38.196
- Aha!
I found the earrings!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.698
            - Dino! Get up here!

11:39.700 --> 11:41.399
- Yeah, dino!
Get in here!

11:41.401 --> 11:43.935
      So you can watch me
   light your house on fire!

11:43.937 --> 11:45.937
- Whoa! Okay, everybody,
just keep it cool.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.473
Everybody be
chilly chill chill.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.742
       - I am gonna slice
         your face off!

11:50.744 --> 11:53.445
         Not chill, dino.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.146
              - Let me in there,
            you sons of bitches!

11:56.817 --> 11:58.367
- Wait, wait!

11:58.368 --> 11:59.918
The trellis won't hold all three
of us at the same time.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.821
              Smart.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.023
            - Whoo!
             - Ooh!

12:05.024 --> 12:07.224
       That was awesome!
 I love being a police officer!

12:07.227 --> 12:09.394
         - That was the opposite
      of being a police officer.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.830
    We just robbed somebody.
        - Who robbed us!

12:11.832 --> 12:13.832
The universe is back on track,
baby!

12:13.834 --> 12:15.166
We got grandma's earrings back!

12:15.168 --> 12:17.135
      - And the rainstick!

12:17.136 --> 12:19.103
 - Which you will be returning.
       - Uh, sure i will.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.672
  - How are we doing on traffic?

12:20.673 --> 12:22.239
      - Green all the way.
    - All right, looks like

12:22.242 --> 12:24.476
    We're actually gonna make it
       in time for this wedding.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.961
            Thank you, universe.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.445
          Thank you for blessing
                  this marriage.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.117
                    Okay, i know
           what you're thinking,

12:32.119 --> 12:33.986
         But this is not a sign.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.854
     I just have to pump the gas
     twice, and turn it back on.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.455
   This happens all the time.

12:37.457 --> 12:44.796
            oh, boy.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.114
- This is the worst day
of my life.

12:46.115 --> 12:47.431
The universe doesn't want me
to marry rosa.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.950
     - Look, it's gonna be fine.

12:48.951 --> 12:50.467
         We'll get the car fixed
       and make it back in time.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.404
      Gina, when's the tow truck
                   getting here?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.339
     - No idea, i'm talking
    to my spiritual advisor.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.274
        He says we have
       an engine problem.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.276
      - Yeah, i know, that's why
        i said call a tow truck!

12:58.278 --> 13:00.378
  - So you meant my spiritual
       advisor is right?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.814
- Guys! This is my fault.
I should've just given up

13:02.816 --> 13:04.516
When fate burned down
the pawn shop, okay?

13:04.518 --> 13:06.885
Stupid adrian.
Stupid adrian!

13:06.887 --> 13:09.287
     Idiot! Read the signs!
           - Enough!

13:09.289 --> 13:11.356
                     I'm so sick
     of this garbage, all right?

13:11.358 --> 13:13.125
     The two of you need to stop

13:13.126 --> 13:14.893
  Looking for signs everywhere--
             oh, my god, a sign.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.395
      - Whoo! He can fly!
          Prop planes!

13:17.397 --> 13:18.429
   You can fly, you can fly!

13:18.431 --> 13:20.398
                  - I'm a vessel
               for the universe.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.434
                          - Wow.
        The chairs look amazing.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.537
  I can't believe you two aren't
       my biggest problem today.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.438
- We're not?
Who is?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.340
           <i> - My arch.</i>
      <i> Isn't she beautiful?</i>

13:31.378 --> 13:34.445
          - I got eye-rolled <i> to,</i>
                      not <i> about!</i>

13:34.447 --> 13:36.447
 - While pimento stares at rosa,

13:36.449 --> 13:39.951
      We'll all be staring at...
                            Her.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.420
        - Yes, we will.
  - She's truly breathtaking.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.889
        There's a double meaning
                        to that.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.357
        The breath that it takes
  to inflate all those balloons.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.862
 Of course i used the hand pump,
   but the bon mot still works.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.397
    oh, no! What's happening?

13:52.399 --> 13:53.849
        Someone tell me
       what's happening.

13:53.850 --> 13:55.300
  - I got some more bad news.
             - Oh.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.368
- Oh, wow.
That thing's huge.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.370
Didn't rosa want things
to be classy?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.606
I mean, she's getting married,
not finishing a marathon.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.341
         - So says the hair guy.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.410
       Stay in your lane, bucko.
                Right, santiago?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.445
       - The arch sucks!
           I'm sorry.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.480
 I didn't want to say anything
     because you're my boss

14:09.482 --> 14:12.450
    And you were so excited,
  but the truth is every time

14:12.452 --> 14:15.386
    I look at it i wanna die
     and take you with me.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.288
                  - Well, i wish
            you'd said something

14:17.290 --> 14:18.623
                  Before i spent
              all day making it.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.326
                      Of course,
           you didn't want to...

14:21.328 --> 14:24.362
              "burst my bubble."
                   pun intended.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.932
                     And then...
                        You did.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.940
- Forget the arch!
Charles didn't sober up rosa.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.475
       She got him drunk!
           - Oh, no.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.210
                How drunk is he?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.944
- Remember the night
they cancelled "bunheads"?

14:40.947 --> 14:42.347
        - We're ruined.
          - It's fine.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.383
I'll handle it.
You got your hands full.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.618
             yeah.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.588
         - This is just 18 shots
                    of espresso.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.324
     It got me through the first
   three months of having twins,

14:53.326 --> 14:54.592
             But i imagine it'll
               sober you up too.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.395
- Aww,
he's taking care of you.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.396
Such a good father.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.398
- Ugh, i miss my father.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.399
     I used to be daddy's little
girl, but we never talk anymore.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.635
          - You don't?
     - That's what happens.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.904
                    You grow up,
 your bond with your dad goes...

15:06.907 --> 15:08.957
 - No, it doesn't always happen.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.008
       All right, not to special
    daddies who put the time in.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.411
    You know, read them stories,
       do their little pigtails.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.346
        - Really, sarge?

15:15.348 --> 15:18.416
        Who do you think
    used to do my pigtails?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.685
- Why can't they
stay babies forever?

15:20.687 --> 15:21.986
           - Berlini!

15:21.988 --> 15:24.555
           - Bellini!
           - Bellini!

15:24.557 --> 15:25.990
  - Okay, this is very scary,

15:25.992 --> 15:27.692
         But it's okay,
because you're a trained pilot.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.693
                  - No, i'm not.
                I'm self-taught.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.928
            - What?
          - Oh, yeah.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.496
  You can learn anything online.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.931
          Ooh, you should see me
                     do origami.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.399
- Oh, do you know
how to do a frog?

15:34.401 --> 15:35.589
                       - Oh, no!

15:35.590 --> 15:36.778
      - Can you do a swan?
             - No.

15:36.779 --> 15:37.967
     - Can you do a crane?
       - What's a crane?

15:37.971 --> 15:40.038
- Okay, he does not know
how to fly a plane.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.342
  - All right, food is ready,
      decorations are set,

15:44.344 --> 15:45.944
  Guests should start arriving
          any moment,

15:45.946 --> 15:48.513
         And the chairs
     are still perfection.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.683
  - She said they're perfection.
     I'm so proud of you, buddy.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.718
- It was you.
You made this happen.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.354
          - All right!
  Let's show rosa what we got.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.356
             Wait.
         Where is rosa?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.593
             narc.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.495
- And that's why
you shouldn't drink.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.397
  - Being drunk sounds terrible.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.699
         - Hello, amy,
    i didn't see you there.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.150
    How did the wedding go?
            - Terry!

16:09.151 --> 16:10.600
      What the hell, man?
    You said you were gonna

16:10.603 --> 16:12.470
         Sober them up.
      - It was her fault.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.039
My girls are never gonna grow up
and lose their virginity.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.741
 - I lost my v-card to the woman

16:16.743 --> 16:19.177
            That refilled nana's
                   oxygen tanks.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.546
        Her hands were so strong
       from turning the nozzles.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.415
this is a room of nightmares.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.616
         - You're the nightmare.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.486
        You made me kill
        my balloon baby.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.555
          Look at me.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.623
   So drunk, i'm alliterating
        like a beatnik.

16:32.625 --> 16:36.661
 - Okay, everybody outside now!

16:36.663 --> 16:38.629
Just know that you brought this
on yourselves.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.665
   - Wait, wait, wait, wait,
       wait, wait, wait!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.500
   Can't we just go to sleep
         for a winker?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.035
   - We're way past winkers.

16:44.037 --> 16:47.538
       Scully, hitchcock,
        bring the frost.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.044
               No!

16:55.515 --> 16:56.781
      - Nice job, you two.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.516
- We are nailing it today!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.084
                          - Hey!
                     We're back.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.651
     Pimento's got the earrings,
           guests are arriving--

17:01.654 --> 17:03.788
  What the hell are you doing?
  - Sobering these clowns up.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.623
All right,
everyone go get dressed.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.342
      you would not believe

17:07.343 --> 17:09.060
       The day i've had.
   - You and me both, sister.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.795
Rosa got drunk,
and then every time

17:10.797 --> 17:13.664
I sent someone in to help her,
she got them drunk too!

17:13.665 --> 17:15.433
It's like she was trying
to tank this thing.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.201
- Yeah, well, pimento called off
         the wedding three times

17:17.203 --> 17:19.487
        Because of the universe.
           If i didn't know them

17:19.488 --> 17:21.771
      Any better, i'd think they
   don't even wanna get married.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.473
           They don't wanna
          get married!

17:28.114 --> 17:29.814
But is it even our place
to say something?

17:29.816 --> 17:31.649
           No, right?
            - Right?

17:31.650 --> 17:33.483
            It's their decision,
         even if it's a bad one.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.286
 They could always get divorced.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.087
- People love getting divorced!
My parents got divorced,

17:37.090 --> 17:39.357
And all it did was scar our
family for years and years.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.325
  - We have to say something.
            - Yeah.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.828
           - I suppose i can see
              how a balloon arch

17:43.830 --> 17:46.431
Might've been a little too much.
     - Oh, yeah, for sure.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.698
   - No, you're supposed to say,

17:47.700 --> 17:50.501
             "this wedding looks
                  like garbage."

17:50.503 --> 17:52.103
- This wedding looks
like garbage.

17:52.105 --> 17:55.339
                       - No, no.
   As long as the bride's happy.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.209
     - Hey there, everyone.
  Great wedding so far, right?

17:58.211 --> 18:00.478
          Uh, next up,
we're gonna take a quick break,

18:00.480 --> 18:03.448
Which happens at every wedding,
      but in the meantime,

18:03.450 --> 18:04.849
       How about a little
         entertainment?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.517
             Boyle?
   You got your devil sticks?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.686
- Always.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.121
         - Hey, adrian.
            - Yeah.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.422
        - We gotta talk.
      - Really? Right now?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.424
         I'm working on my vows.
                            Hey!

18:13.426 --> 18:15.326
  what rhymes with juicy heinie?

18:15.328 --> 18:17.078
- Nothing.
Nothing rhymes with that.

18:17.079 --> 18:18.829
     I would cut that line.
    - But that's all i have.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.099
- Forget it.
The thing i wanna say is,

18:21.101 --> 18:23.101
Maybe the universe wasn't
telling you stuff today.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.303
Maybe you were telling
yourself something.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.371
     - Telling myself what?
   - Yeah, tell himself what?

18:27.373 --> 18:29.407
   - What are you doing here?
 - I'm a part of this journey.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.876
         Don't you dare
       try to cut me out.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.245
                          - Wow,
             you look beautiful.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.214
- Thanks, amy.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.149
I'm super nervous.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.318
 Kinda wish i was still drunk.
            - Yeah.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.154
                   About that...
         I think we should talk.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.423
  Why?
are you packing a bellini?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.258
- Look, i spent the whole day
denying the fact

18:47.260 --> 18:48.526
That there were signs,
but i was wrong.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.394
   They were actually there.
         - So far, duh.

18:50.396 --> 18:53.264
- The fact that you kept
cancelling your own wedding...

18:53.266 --> 18:55.133
    That was the real sign.
            - Whoa!

18:55.135 --> 18:57.268
    You took the situation,
  and you flippity-flopped it.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.370
          - I don't think it was
 an accident that you got drunk,

18:59.372 --> 19:01.439
                 Or that you got
            everyone else drunk.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.374
- What? You think i'm trying
to sabotage my own wedding?

19:03.376 --> 19:06.244
                 - I don't know.
                       Were you?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.246
- Maybe i was.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.247
I don't know, something
just doesn't feel right.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.582
Oh, man,
i gotta talk to adrian.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.484
             - I was my own sign
                 the whole time?

19:13.486 --> 19:16.187
              Wow, that's a real
  m. Night shyamalan twist the--

19:16.189 --> 19:17.455
                     Oh!
                        "signs"!

19:18.858 --> 19:20.258
            - Wait, do you think
        he's behind all of this?

19:20.260 --> 19:21.325
- I do not.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.194
     - I should go talk to rosa.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.329
         Thanks, jake.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.331
  - Jake, you done good, kid.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.468
           Glad i took you along
                   for the ride.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.470
   - Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!

19:32.472 --> 19:33.938
- All right,
give it up for charles.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.473
              Yeah!

19:35.475 --> 19:37.341
        - No, give it up
     for the devil sticks.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.243
 They're the real heroes here.
      - No, they are not.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.478
No one thinks that.
All right, i'm not sure

19:40.480 --> 19:42.480
How much time we have,
but anybody know a joke?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.348
          - Oh, i do!

19:44.350 --> 19:45.883
     Two jews walk into a--
        - no! Sit down!

19:45.885 --> 19:48.186
      No, definitely not.
              Oh!

19:51.224 --> 19:53.524
- All right,
we have an announcement to make.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.393
  - We're not getting married.
              - Aww!

19:55.395 --> 19:56.594
    - You can shove those "awws"
                  up your butts.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.229
- Yeah,
or i'll come out there,

19:58.231 --> 19:59.397
And i'll do it for ya!

19:59.399 --> 20:00.882
  - What an interesting event.

20:00.883 --> 20:02.366
              - I just feel like
         we were rushing things.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.968
             We love each other,

20:03.970 --> 20:05.903
      But we haven't even really
  spent that much time together.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.371
           We've never even been
                 on a real date,

20:07.373 --> 20:09.340
     So we're gonna start there.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.977
- Shut up!

20:12.979 --> 20:14.445
Thank you for the presents.
We're keeping them.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.214
         - All of them.
  - Yeah, if you got a problem

20:16.216 --> 20:17.882
    With it, come talk to us
      in the parking lot.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.984
    - Also, in just 14 hours
        amy put together

20:19.986 --> 20:22.386
        The most amazing
non-wedding wedding in history.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.921
                   - Better than
         "sleepless in seattle."

20:23.923 --> 20:25.890
- Nope.
That is also nora ephron.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.558
         Kill yourself.
  - Don't take it personally.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.393
- Anyway, we can't let all this
          go to waste.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.262
 Everybody, clear these chairs
   out of here, and let's get

20:31.264 --> 20:33.397
      This party started.
     - No, not the chairs!

20:33.399 --> 20:35.533
       - Don't touch the chairs,
                   you monsters!

20:38.571 --> 20:40.938
            - Yeah?
- Oh, i just wanted to thank you

20:40.940 --> 20:43.274
  For all your help yesterday.
      - I didn't do much.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.475
                 It was nothing.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.477
           Good day.
       - What's going on?

20:46.479 --> 20:49.580
           - I'm just very busy.
               Get back to work.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.549
- Wait.
What do you have in there?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.486
       - A balloon arch.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.421
- Oh, my god, captain.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.423
She is magnificent.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.493
         - Vindication!

21:02.495 --> 21:04.562
        <i> - Not a doctor.</i>
              <i> Shh.</i>
