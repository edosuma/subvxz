WEBVTT

00:44.720 --> 00:47.110
It's called the Victoria and Albert.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.633
And, darling,
we're going to see the world in it.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.713
Perhaps we should start by visiting
Uncle Leopold in Belgium.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.636
It's about time we saw inside one of
his palaces, don't you think?

01:05.319 --> 01:06.913
Thank you.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.314
Where else would you like to go?

01:10.480 --> 01:12.836
Louis Philippe had a meeting
promised yesterday.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.879
It's his son Antoine, the Duke
of Montpensier that worries me.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.952
- Indeed, sir.
- Good morning, Sir Robert.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.600
Lord Alfred.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.200
Our ambassador in Madrid writes
that the French are, as he puts it,

01:26.360 --> 01:29.239
"sniffing around the young
Spanish Queen".

01:30.280 --> 01:33.956
The Duke of Montpensier was there
last week and presented her with a zebra.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.395
What a curious present.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.756
<i>I'm not sure I would have married you,
Albert,</i>

01:37.920 --> 01:40.071
if you'd given me such a thing -
so inconvenient.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.677
And the poor beast, coming from Africa,
must find the climate most trying.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.036
I believe the climate
is very warm in Spain, ma'am.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.680
Of course.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.674
But surely Queen Isabel
can find a husband for herself?

01:50.840 --> 01:52.877
Queen Isabel is not yet of age, ma'am.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.795
And her mother, who acts as regent,
makes all the decisions.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.590
Poor girl.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.316
A French match would be
against the British interest.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.713
Louis Philippe wants to create a French
Empire in Europe through marriage.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.873
That would affect trade
and our access to India.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.238
We spent 20 years fighting Napoleon.
We don't want another war.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.312
No, indeed.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.393
Perhaps I should write a letter
to King Louis Philippe

02:21.560 --> 02:25.156
to express our displeasure
at the thought of a Spanish match.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.077
What do you think, Albert?

02:31.280 --> 02:33.033
Erm...

02:34.080 --> 02:38.233
.. I'm not sure I am qualified
to have an opinion.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.879
Not qualified?

02:41.040 --> 02:43.919
I'm sure Uncle Leopold would be horrified
to hear such a thing.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.356
I'm not sure writing
would do any good, ma'am.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.433
Louis Philippe is only on the throne
because he's a very wily man.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.160
- He will not easily be deflected.
- I think a self-made king

02:52.320 --> 02:55.677
like Louis Philippe should be flattered
to get a letter from an anointed queen.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.797
I shall see to it.

02:59.520 --> 03:05.517
Sir, I worry that a letter from Her Majesty
might be... misinterpreted.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.354
You are aware, of course,
that your Uncle Leopold

03:08.520 --> 03:10.955
wants Prince Ferdinand
to marry Queen Isabel?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.032
That's not of my concern.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.112
Indeed not, sir. But...

03:15.280 --> 03:19.559
I suspect Louis Philippe will think
there is a covert conspiracy.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.431
I am not my uncle's keeper.

04:53.440 --> 04:58.310
You have so many secrets from me,
you have to hide your diary?

04:58.480 --> 05:00.392
Secrets?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.313
I don't have any secrets.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.552
Not from you, anyway.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.397
Sir Robert...

05:19.560 --> 05:22.439
does not think that we should
write to Louis Philippe.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.073
Why not?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.274
Well, he...

05:28.440 --> 05:32.116
believes he will think that we are
promoting a Coburg match.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.480
Of course it would be better
for England if Queen Isabella

05:35.640 --> 05:38.917
married a Coburg,
but we're hardly promoting the match.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.756
The important thing is that
she doesn't marry the French Prince.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.718
Hm.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.032
<i>But perhaps Peel is right,
a letter is pointless.</i>

05:54.800 --> 05:57.110
I think I need to look
Louis Philippe in the eye

05:57.280 --> 05:59.272
and settle the matter in person.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.272
A visit to France?

06:01.440 --> 06:03.238
I wonder, ma'am, is that wise?

06:03.400 --> 06:05.756
Louis Philippe is a master of duplicity.

06:05.920 --> 06:10.119
I have had experience of people who say
one thing and mean another, Sir Robert.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.273
Indeed, ma'am.
But his father, the Duke of Orleans,

06:13.440 --> 06:17.116
supported the Revolution, only to face
the guillotine during the Terror,

06:17.280 --> 06:19.636
so Louis Philippe has
learned to trust no one.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.440
I have always found him
extremely difficult to deal with.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.160
Which is exactly why I must go.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.789
Between monarchs,
there can be a real frankness.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.792
I can say things to him that you cannot.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.590
I shall have Albert by my side.
I could not have a more able advisor.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.559
- Indeed.
- Erm... please, both of you, forgive me.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.598
There is something I have to attend to.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.590
Excuse me, ma'am, I wonder,
is the Prince entirely himself?

06:47.760 --> 06:50.832
He still seems most affected
by his father's death.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.277
I think perhaps a trip to France
might revive his spirits.

06:55.320 --> 07:00.031
Well, I only wish I could accompany you,
ma'am, but I have pressing business here.

07:01.720 --> 07:05.316
Might I suggest that you take Drummond
to represent the government?

07:05.480 --> 07:06.516
He could be useful.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.310
I have no objection to Drummond,
Sir Robert, but I do not need a nursemaid.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.790
Which dress would you like
to travel in, ma'am?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.952
The purple silk or the white organza?

07:25.120 --> 07:28.477
- Uh... the purple silk, I think.
- Very good, ma'am.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.750
Skerrett, have you seen my bag?

07:31.920 --> 07:35.391
The one with Dash embroidered on it.
I can't find it anywhere.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.153
It's over here, ma'am.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.079
Here it is.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.312
Oh. See, I can't travel
abroad without Dash.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.030
So it's true, ma'am, we
are to travel to France?

07:51.360 --> 07:55.718
- Quite true.
- And may I ask who is to accompany you?

07:55.880 --> 07:59.032
Why, you and Miss Coke,
and Lord Alfred, of course,

07:59.200 --> 08:02.318
and Mr Drummond is coming
from the Government.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.156
Lehzen, I am so sorry.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.915
Who else could I trust
to look after my children?

08:11.080 --> 08:14.073
With your permission, ma'am,
I would like to be excused.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.390
What nonsense!

08:15.560 --> 08:18.951
I can't face the French court
without my Mistress of the Robes.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.272
But ma'am, France is a Godless country.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.557
Then you must bring your Bible.

08:31.240 --> 08:36.235
Do you know I'm the first British
monarch to visit France since Henry VIII?

08:39.600 --> 08:42.354
I hope this could be
the start of a new relationship.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.319
I'm sure that between us,
we can make Louis Philippe see

08:45.480 --> 08:47.790
it would be unwise to jeopardise
such an alliance.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.633
Don't you think?

08:52.280 --> 08:55.352
- Albert?
- Sorry, Victoria, I'm...

08:57.080 --> 08:59.197
I'm not a good sailor.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.431
- I can't get used to it.
- Haven't you been on a boat before?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.512
- I've never seen the sea before.
- Oh.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.672
You'll get your sea legs right enough.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.436
I thought I would die from the sickness
when I first got on the boat from Ireland

09:20.600 --> 09:22.114
but you get used to it.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.754
Gardez-vous!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.910
- Poupée?
- A doll.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.231
Maybe we speak English, Victoria?

10:09.400 --> 10:12.313
I'm the first French King
to be able to speak your language,

10:12.480 --> 10:14.915
and I would be delighted to practise.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.474
Coburg.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.280
I am very glad to meet
you finally, monsieur.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.033
Pleasure.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.479
Iis sont charmants.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.836
You are a very charming couple.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.276
So... So young, so fresh.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.876
Kissed on both cheeks,
as if she were a washerwoman.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.316
I believe it is the French way.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.995
Isn't that right, Lord Alfred?

11:13.160 --> 11:14.958
I've no idea.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.400
To think I promised your mother
I'd look after you,

11:18.560 --> 11:22.759
and here we are in Sodom and Gomorrah.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.071
The country has no shame.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.436
Those court ladies were all painted.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.637
And the King? He smelt more like...

12:14.960 --> 12:18.510
Welcome to the Chateau d'Eu,
my summer cottage.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.270
Did you notice the way
the court ladies were staring at me?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.955
They were probably just
admiring your jewels, ma'am.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.237
I don't think it was admiration.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.313
I think they thought
there was something missing.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.593
Skerrett...

13:33.840 --> 13:37.675
.. could you find me something
to enhance my complexion?

13:37.840 --> 13:40.639
I want to look more... worldly.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.750
Certainly, ma'am.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.473
Lord Alfred, do you observe that
all the ladies' faces, they are painted?

13:55.640 --> 13:57.154
Yes, sir, I think you may be right.

13:57.320 --> 14:02.520
- And paint is surprising, no?
- The French take a different view on that.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.149
Yes, I believe even the King might...

14:05.320 --> 14:09.075
Son Altesse, le Prince Ernest,
Duc de Saxe-Cobourg.

14:11.160 --> 14:15.120
I'm so happy to see you, my dear Duke,
as I'm sure are all my court.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.749
The pleasure is all mine.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.670
Albert.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.232
I'm surprised that you could leave Coburg.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.152
The only surprising thing
is that I didn't leave sooner.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.953
Oh, merci.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.076
A charming touch, don't you think?

14:53.240 --> 14:57.120
To send all the ladies flowers
to match the colour of their dress.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.392
I wonder, miss, erm...

15:02.560 --> 15:06.634
as you speak French, if you could
translate something for me?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.917
It's for the Queen.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.993
It's a lotion...

15:33.160 --> 15:35.755
for the... the chest area.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.039
- Bonsoir.
- Guten Abend.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.319
I must offer my condolences on the death
of your father, mes chers cousins.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.278
Merci, Louis.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.000
My father met his end in the embrace
of Madame la Guillotine.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.197
He made the mistake of thinking
that he could ally himself with the mob.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.434
But in the end... they turned on him, too.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.711
I loved my father. He took particular care
of my education in every respect.

16:55.880 --> 17:00.909
There are not many men who would share
a woman like Madame Genlis with their son.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.072
So you understand now, mon cher cousin,

17:03.240 --> 17:06.153
why I am so determined to secure
the future for my family.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.871
Well, every man wants that.

17:10.040 --> 17:13.351
I am the only king in Europe
who has had to make his own living.

17:13.520 --> 17:17.752
I don't want my son Antoine
to face the same fate.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.348
Sa Majesté, la Reine Victoria.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.272
How beautiful you look, ma cousine.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.957
- Ernest, what a lovely surprise.
- Is it really you, Victoria?

17:55.120 --> 17:58.318
For a moment there,
I thought I was back in Paris.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.993
The Queen looks so well
with these flowers.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.753
She could be French.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.550
I was hoping, Louis Philippe,
that we'd talk about

18:40.720 --> 18:43.110
the future husband of the Queen of Spain.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.159
I know it is a subject of which
we both take an interest.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.200
My dear Victoria,
remember that you are in France,

18:50.360 --> 18:53.558
and in my country,
we never mix business with pleasure.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.795
Mm!

19:04.960 --> 19:07.270
Mm-hm. Fantastique.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.590
Mm.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.150
The ortolan is a great delicacy.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.757
The birds are trapped
and then drowned in Armagnac.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.274
Drowned?

19:16.440 --> 19:18.750
I've been close to death
on several occasions.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.834
I assure you I would not mind
drowning in very old Armagnac.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.830
- It does seem rather cruel, though.
- Wait until you've tasted one.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.674
Fortune favours the bold.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.836
Taste it.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.597
The napkin is to hide your face from God,
ma chère cousine.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.594
Look at that.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.395
Such a shame the Duchess
had to retire with a headache.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.758
I think she might consider it
to be the devil's work.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.640
Well, I'm prepared to be led
into temptation.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.678
What about you, Drummond?

20:12.720 --> 20:16.600
I think to refuse such a creation
might cause a diplomatic incident.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.319
Albert.

20:26.440 --> 20:31.117
I'm beginning to think Louis Philippe has no
intention of discussing the Spanish situation.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.318
When I brought it up,
he changed the subject entirely.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.151
I can't complain about
the hospitality, though.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.836
Although, I don't want to eat
those ortolans again. Do you?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.909
I do not wish to do any of it again.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.839
Ma'am.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.795
Albert, what's the matter with you?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.640
I'm just not comfortable here, Victoria.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.191
It is a place of artifice and deceit.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.352
Louis Philippe is a man
of the most vulgar tastes.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.555
The court ladies, they do not have
any concept of purity.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.873
And...

21:34.480 --> 21:36.517
And tonight...

21:39.000 --> 21:41.276
.. when you came in, I saw that...

21:45.520 --> 21:47.318
.. you had painted your face.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.270
Why would you feel the need to do that?

21:52.760 --> 21:55.480
The French ladies looked so smart.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.111
I wanted to look more like them
and less like the Duchess of Buccleuch.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.678
Please never do it again.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.598
I do not know if I could bear it.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.195
It was only a little rouge, Albert, but...

22:16.160 --> 22:17.879
.. yes, of course.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.512
If it means so much to you.

22:29.280 --> 22:33.320
Have you managed to speak to
Louis Philippe about the Spanish Queen?

22:33.480 --> 22:36.359
Do you know what we talked about,
the King and I?

22:38.120 --> 22:42.160
About how his father passed down his
mistress to him to complete his education.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.312
The French do things differently.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.632
And we're here to do business,
not to judge them.

22:49.520 --> 22:53.309
Your family is hardly blameless.
Think of Uncle Leopold.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.597
What do you mean?

22:56.760 --> 22:59.070
- He, too, has a mistress.
- Exactly!

23:01.560 --> 23:03.756
It's why we have to be different.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.600
<i>We a re different.</i>

23:08.640 --> 23:10.518
Well, I wish that I could believe that.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.873
Après vous.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.077
Everything here is so charming.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.358
I had no idea that kitchen gardens
could be so delightful.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.715
My pride and joy.

23:29.880 --> 23:34.432
We French believe that there is beauty
in a cabbage as well as a rose.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.353
And when you've starved on the streets,

23:36.520 --> 23:39.194
you realise how beautiful a cabbage can be.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.278
You've lived an interesting life, cousin.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.796
I've been lucky.
When I was teaching in Switzerland

23:45.960 --> 23:48.714
or in your country trying to make a living,

23:48.880 --> 23:52.760
I never thought that one day
I would be King of the French.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.350
There are many people in my country
who thought that I would not be Queen.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.159
But I never doubted it.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.552
Specialité du château.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.550
Merci.

24:21.240 --> 24:26.952
My years of real life taught me that you
should never go anywhere without a knife.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.511
- Well, you don't call this real life, do you?
- Don't you?

24:32.880 --> 24:36.112
I'm a patriot to my bones.

24:36.280 --> 24:40.320
But still... I envy you your country.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.360
Even with its rain and its roast beef.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.879
But this... Oh, this is glorious.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.714
You know how many times
my people tried to kill me? Seven times.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.190
We have that in common.
I, too, was shot at.

24:55.360 --> 24:59.070
Yeah, but in your case,
I believe the gun was not loaded.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.837
I don't mind so much for myself.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.840
But for my children I want safety.
The kind that you English enjoy.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.835
Then you should reconsider the marriage
between your son and the Spanish Queen.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.753
Such an alliance, I...

25:16.800 --> 25:19.838
.. I fear would upset the balance
between our countries.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.959
You are an iron fist in a velvet glove.

25:24.800 --> 25:29.750
You look so delicate, so charming,
so mignon.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.870
But inside you are Boadicea.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.033
If the Spanish Queen were to be
married to Prince Ferdinand,

25:36.200 --> 25:38.351
well, that, too, would have consequences.

25:38.520 --> 25:42.719
These handsome Coburg princes
cannot be allowed to build an empire

25:42.880 --> 25:44.951
by snapping up all the queens of Europe.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.759
I was not snapped up.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.756
I chose to marry Albert because I love him.

25:51.320 --> 25:54.711
Sans doute, if I was a young lady like you,

25:54.880 --> 25:57.998
I, too, would lose my heart
for such beautiful eyes.

25:59.800 --> 26:04.033
But he's a Coburg nonetheless.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.711
You must forgive me,
but we French are cynique.

26:09.880 --> 26:10.870
Cynical?

26:11.040 --> 26:14.351
Cynical when it comes to
the matter of the heart.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.716
We try not to confuse love and marriage,

26:16.880 --> 26:20.510
but I can see now that
is not the English way.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.354
No. No, it is not.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.034
Ha.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.035
There is a time to be serious,
but it's never before lunch.

26:29.200 --> 26:34.798
And in your honour, I arranged
a petite fête champêtre. Come.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.440
Lovely.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.876
Isn't it charming, sir?

27:01.040 --> 27:03.509
I know how much you like forests.

27:03.680 --> 27:08.311
This is hardly a forest, Lord Alfred.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.072
This is more akin to a boudoir.

27:14.560 --> 27:17.280
Well, your French is
improving, sir, I must say.

27:32.960 --> 27:37.910
I just wanted to say how sorry I was
to hear of the death of your father, sir.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.753
Thank you, Miss Coke.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.194
You must be feeling his loss very deeply.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.070
Oh, I am finding ways to distract myself.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.554
- But I thought...
- What did you think, Miss Coke?

27:54.720 --> 27:57.280
That I was a man
of delicate sensibility?

27:58.400 --> 28:00.278
I'm afraid I must disappoint you.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.472
Ça va?

28:11.960 --> 28:14.156
- Ernest.
- Albert.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.073
Are you all right?

28:16.240 --> 28:21.520
Ja. The Marquise and I
are talking about livestock.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.673
She prefers goat's milk for bathing.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.919
May I?

28:28.080 --> 28:30.117
Ah. Excusez-moi.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.633
Ernest, I'm...

28:37.040 --> 28:38.633
.. concerned.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.831
You're behaving like Papa.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.239
I like to think that I'm
honouring his memory.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.390
No, no, no!

28:49.560 --> 28:52.473
A dish of tea and some toast.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.911
- Duchess.
- Oh, Lord Alfred, thank goodness.

29:02.080 --> 29:06.472
Will you tell the man all I require
is a dish of tea and some toast?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.916
None of this foreign food.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.998
My dear Duchess, I can assure you
that the bread is fresh.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.197
But it's such a peculiar shape.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.391
I wondered if you could explain
to me how the coppicing is managed.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.678
Perhaps if we go for a walk,
you can meet the charbonnier.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.514
He will tell you how
often we cut the trees.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.352
- Suivez-moi.
- Après vous.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.280
Where are we going?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.832
You walk very quickly.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.195
I enjoy the exercise.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.477
- Do you not?
- Not really.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.715
Do you never tire of all of this...

30:36.880 --> 30:38.439
tableau vivant?

30:38.600 --> 30:41.957
I'm a prince.
One day I ought to marry a queen.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.759
Like you.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.113
What are you doing?

30:54.120 --> 30:55.759
I'm going to swim.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.231
But it will be cold and wet.
It's not civilised.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.993
Precisely.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.673
Shall we?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.760
I don't see why not.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.913
Whoa!

31:38.160 --> 31:41.278
I like my bathing water warm
like a woman's thigh.

31:41.440 --> 31:44.990
Hm. Well, I think my brother has a point.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.800
Whoo!

32:13.960 --> 32:15.553
Oh!

32:34.160 --> 32:35.640
How strange.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.031
- That sounds like...
- Oh, some peasants.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.432
There is a place nearby
where they like to bathe.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.440
Oh!

32:55.520 --> 32:58.319
Yes. Just some peasants.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.631
They must have the simple pleasures.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.920
- Ah.
- Whoo!

33:41.200 --> 33:44.796
- How was your afternoon?
- Oh, wonderful, thank you, sir.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.196
Did you enjoy your swim, Albert?

34:00.480 --> 34:02.073
I saw you.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.319
And so did la Duchesse de Berry.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.837
What possessed you?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.277
Is that conduct becoming for the husband
of the Queen of England?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.079
What sort of man are you?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.556
Oh.

34:21.719 --> 34:25.190
La Duchesse says that you, Albert,
that you are a noble peasant.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.397
Oh. What do you think?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.790
Well, I wish you would stop looking
so disapproving

34:30.960 --> 34:32.757
and maybe smile a bit more.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.592
- Mm-hm.
- And I can't understand why

34:34.760 --> 34:37.514
we can't stay in bed just a little bit
longer in the mornings.

34:39.639 --> 34:42.280
Ah. But nevertheless, I have to say...

34:43.280 --> 34:45.237
.. you're the man that I love.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.437
Till death do us part.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.592
As long as we both shall live.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.280
Shh!

35:34.160 --> 35:35.310
I...

35:36.440 --> 35:40.275
I need to tell you something,
but I do not know where to begin.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.478
When I was in Coburg...

35:50.360 --> 35:52.079
.. Leopold...

35:56.040 --> 35:59.590
.. Leopold told me that he believes
that he is my father.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.512
Your mother and Uncle Leopold?

36:09.800 --> 36:12.235
He asked me not to tell...

36:14.920 --> 36:16.513
.. anyone.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.670
But I find I cannot bear this alone.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.952
Albert, listen to me.

36:39.440 --> 36:43.070
Yes, of course Leopold wants to
believe he's your father.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.993
Any man would.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.438
But he can't know for certain.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.793
But I'm an impostor.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.275
Our children.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.600
Our marriage.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.352
All of it built on deceit.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.633
I would be a bastard, Victoria.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.831
I'm ashamed to stand by your side.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.232
Then we have a problem.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.833
Because I cannot face
this world without you.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.831
Albert, I don't care who your father is.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.600
All that matters to me is you...

37:47.120 --> 37:48.873
.. my husband...

37:49.040 --> 37:51.680
standing by my side now and always.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.600
But...

37:55.600 --> 37:57.592
.. I'm not the man you married.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.392
Albert, I know who you are...

38:07.400 --> 38:09.232
.. even if you don't.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.359
Now, you take my hand...

38:18.560 --> 38:22.110
.. and we go downstairs and we'll do
what we came here to do.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.319
Together.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.869
I would like to thank you,
dear cousin, for your hospitality.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.509
This has been my first visit to France.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.752
- I do hope it won't be my last.
- No, indeed.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.154
Our two nations should be,
as they say in America,

38:50.320 --> 38:51.800
kissing cousins.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.074
But we are at odds.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.277
You want your son
to marry the Spanish Queen

38:57.440 --> 38:59.955
and yet my government... well...

39:00.800 --> 39:03.520
.. they will say it is tantamount
to a declaration of war.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.240
But if the Spanish Queen
marries your cousin,

39:06.400 --> 39:08.073
Prince Ferdinand of Coburg,

39:08.240 --> 39:10.755
who is so closely allied
with your good self,

39:10.920 --> 39:14.834
then my government will think
it is an act of aggression.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.595
That is what we call in France une impasse.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.639
There is another solution...

39:21.640 --> 39:23.279
.. should we wish to take it.

39:23.720 --> 39:26.633
Imagine, if you will, that...

39:29.200 --> 39:31.237
.. this bunch of grapes...

39:35.120 --> 39:36.839
.. is the Queen of Spain.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.272
Now, here they are on the vine.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.719
They look delicious, don't you agree?

39:47.880 --> 39:51.351
But they are guarded by a vicious dog.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.638
So the first person that picks a grape...

39:55.480 --> 39:57.278
.. is bitten by the dog...

39:58.120 --> 39:59.600
.. mauled to death.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.074
So the question
that we have to ask ourselves is

40:03.240 --> 40:07.598
are the grapes, delicious though they are,
worth the consequence?

40:12.600 --> 40:14.990
So, if I follow your metaphor...

40:15.720 --> 40:18.599
.. you propose that we both do nothing?

40:20.720 --> 40:23.918
It would be a shame to let
our new friendship wither on the vine.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.872
But my government will think
that I am weak.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.157
They don't trust British.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.874
"Perfide Albion," Napoleon said.
Excuse me, ma chérie.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.999
Surely you do not care
what your ministers think?

40:37.760 --> 40:42.073
Surely you have the authority
to present a... a fait accompli?

40:43.760 --> 40:47.231
The understanding of one sovereign
to another.

40:55.960 --> 40:58.031
So let's drink champagne...

40:59.000 --> 41:04.359
.. to celebrate the new understanding
between our two great nations.

41:04.520 --> 41:09.834
To the understanding between us,
to the Entente Cordiale.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.592
To the Entente Cordiale.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.240
Champagne!

41:47.520 --> 41:49.159
I miss France.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.753
I don't.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.557
Did you not enjoy it at all, Aunt?

41:54.720 --> 41:58.191
You have to admit that the French court
was extremely elegant.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.670
Elegance is all very well, but...

42:02.120 --> 42:04.874
.. my brother Mungo
was killed at Trafalgar.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.510
They may do things with style, Wilhelmina,

42:08.680 --> 42:10.637
but I do not like the French.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.792
At heart, they are not...

42:13.960 --> 42:15.360
.. respectable.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.354
What about you, Drummond?
What do you think?

42:18.520 --> 42:20.796
I agree with the Duchess.

42:20.960 --> 42:25.477
The trip was stylish but...
not altogether respectable.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.800
Hello! Oh!

42:38.600 --> 42:40.159
Hello, darling!

42:40.320 --> 42:41.834
Mwah.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.992
Have you missed me? Oh.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.674
Vicky. Hello.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.479
Oh, let's see you.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.474
My goodness, Lehzen.
Oh, you've grown.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.680
It took a while, of course, for Louis Philippe
to see things from our point of view,

42:56.840 --> 43:00.277
but once he had heard the arguments
for mutual neutrality,

43:00.440 --> 43:02.671
he realised that was
the only reasonable position.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.991
Albert was so eloquent, really.

43:05.160 --> 43:07.277
It was his words that convinced the King.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.717
- To His Royal Highness.
- His Royal Highness.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.952
Well, we are grateful to you, sir.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.555
The country cannot afford
another war with France.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.518
Do you really think it would come to that?

43:21.680 --> 43:24.400
- I found Louis Philippe most congenial.
- I'm sure he was, ma'am.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.313
But his country is not.

43:26.480 --> 43:29.279
They've had one revolution,
they could easily have another.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.478
When a king is under pressure,
the easiest way to unite his people

43:32.640 --> 43:34.279
is to find a common enemy.

43:34.440 --> 43:35.590
Mm.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.958
Do you wish to say something, Duchess?

43:40.120 --> 43:43.955
I was merely thinking how pleasant it is
to be eating English food again.

43:44.120 --> 43:47.033
You are too old-fashioned.
I thought the food was delicious.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.157
It is not honest food.

43:49.320 --> 43:52.916
Everything's covered in sauces.
Who knows what's underneath?

43:53.080 --> 43:56.391
Give me a wholesome plate
of boiled mutton and turnips.

44:23.720 --> 44:27.919
It's nothing to do with you or the Queen.
You did your best. It's not naive, sir.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.390
How are we going to explain this
to the Queen?

44:30.560 --> 44:32.153
I should've listened to my instincts.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.471
Albert, what is it?
Whatever's the matter?

44:34.640 --> 44:36.552
We have been deceived.

44:36.720 --> 44:41.590
Your Majesty, King Louis's son has
become engaged to the Spanish Queen.

44:43.400 --> 44:47.155
- Louis Philippe gave us his word.
- He was using us, Victoria.

45:09.640 --> 45:13.156
I really thought
we had achieved something great there.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.792
Albert, look at me.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.831
As Wellington would say,
we may have lost the battle...

45:25.160 --> 45:29.074
When we went to France, we were...
not ourselves, you and I.

45:30.760 --> 45:34.800
But now, whatever happens... we're united.

45:38.160 --> 45:40.311
There are no secrets between us.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.113
No secrets.

45:52.400 --> 45:55.518
Actually, that's not... quite true.
