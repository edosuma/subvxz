think about those things.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.163
A lot of times, you know,

16:05.165 --> 16:06.764
we used to have
these little fly traps.

16:06.766 --> 16:07.632
Gerome would come in.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.067
He would take
those fly traps out.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.902
He was a real man like that.
He was an October Libra, though.

16:10.904 --> 16:12.070
They're later...
Late bloomers.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.738
She has got to go.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.974
Yes, she has got to go.
Mm-hmm.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.643
And I threw a $1,500 pair of
shoes into a hot oven

16:18.645 --> 16:20.011
because of my white guilt.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.113
You're still spending
that much money on shoes?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.948
Bow, I'm gonna need you to stay
on point, okay? All right.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.450
'Cause right now
we need to fire black nanny.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.851
Black nanny.
Yes.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.486
They're getting rid of my Vivi?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.321
Why, God, why?

16:30.323 --> 16:34.359
Well, at least we'll always have
the burn ward.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.794
And that time we were behind her
going up the stairs.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.930
Oh, yeah!
[ Gasps ]

16:38.932 --> 16:41.766
So, we're gonna say Susie Kwest
wets the bed?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.034
Did we fact-check this?

16:43.036 --> 16:44.969
Who cares?

16:44.971 --> 16:48.272
Meatball Gate really put us
in a hole, and if we do this,

16:48.274 --> 16:50.875
there is no way
she can recover.

16:50.877 --> 16:54.012
Really?
She'll never recover?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.680
That's awful.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.215
Let's do it.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.050
All right, and posting it...

16:59.052 --> 17:00.852
Whoa!
- I don't think so.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.054
- What?
- I have been watching you two.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.222
This is wrong.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.691
Diane, if you want to be
class president,

17:06.693 --> 17:08.826
you need to be a leader,
not a bully.

17:08.828 --> 17:12.030
And, Zoey, you are too pretty
to be mean.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.364
Oh, thank you!

17:13.366 --> 17:14.699
No, not, "Thank you."

17:14.701 --> 17:16.501
Somebody is gonna
whup that ass!

17:16.503 --> 17:18.336
And then what, huh?

17:18.338 --> 17:21.239
Now, come on. Go.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.709
And don't just do better.
Be better.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.144
Go.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.478
Vivian don't play.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.348
Yeah, she even got through
to me, and I'm broken inside.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.716
Yeah.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.386
[ Gasps ]

17:35.388 --> 17:38.856
How can we fire her when
she's so good with our kids?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.726
Yeah, and it's not only
the big stuff.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.928
She got Jack
to change his underwear

17:43.930 --> 17:45.730
three out of five days
this week.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.466
[ Gasps ] You're kidding me!

17:49.269 --> 17:51.169
[ Both gasp ]

<i>So instead of kicking</i>
<i>black nanny to the curb,</i>

17:54.040 --> 17:57.241
<i>we sat her down on the sofa</i>
<i>and had a conversation</i>

17:57.243 --> 17:58.943

17:58.945 --> 18:00.244
Look, I'm going to be
completely honest with you.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.679
- Okay.
- When I first met you...

18:01.681 --> 18:03.381
Mm-hmm.
...I tripped over how black you are.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.383
I know. I-I-I remember.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.717
Acoustics.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.186
- Right. Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.787
What I think Dre's
trying to say is

18:09.789 --> 18:11.255
that we've never had
a black person

18:11.257 --> 18:12.690
working in our house.
[ Chuckles ]

18:12.692 --> 18:14.425
And I just felt
so comfortable with you.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.793
I felt like
we were girlfriends.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.295
No, and I felt the same way.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.362
We... Well,
I didn't, you know.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.098
- Okay.
- I felt hella uncomfortable.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.366
Mm-hmm. What?
Because all my boxes of shoes...

18:22.368 --> 18:24.469
and my two Benzes
and my crazy jacket game

18:24.471 --> 18:27.038
and my Sonicare and my neti pot.
Okay, all right.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.639
You don't have to feel guilty.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.408
I admire how hard you work.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.943
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.611
I-I hope to ball out and...
and have what you do one day.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.079
Well, that's probably
not gonna happen.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.381
- Dre.
- W-W-W-With hard work.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.950
With hard work,
it... it... it could happen.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.418
- Yeah.
- And... And a GED.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.819
- Yeah.
- But anyway, you know,

18:41.821 --> 18:43.588
the lines got a little blurred.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.290
Mm-hmm. But moving forward,
I have to be comfortable

18:46.292 --> 18:48.226
with who I am in my own house.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.994
Yes, and I need to know
that what happens

18:49.996 --> 18:51.796
at the Johnsons

18:51.798 --> 18:54.132
Mm-hmm. Right here.
No, I-I am so sorry.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.501
I-I-I screwed up
that whole nail-shop thing.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.903
Mm-hmm.I almost felt like I
was talking about my sister,

18:58.905 --> 19:00.404
Yolanda, you know.
- Mm-hmm.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.173
And... And she had
just asked me to pee in a cup

19:02.175 --> 19:03.508
for her for the third time.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.976
She... She is a mess.
- Don't...

19:04.978 --> 19:07.011
And...
And there I go again.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.679
-Mm-hmm.
-I-I'm sorry.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.848
You know what,
let's just keep it professional.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.283
- Agreed.
- Mm-hmm.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.118
And to that point,
if we are going to

19:14.120 --> 19:16.921
keep it professional,
uh, Bow, I-I can't...

19:16.923 --> 19:18.789
I can't be braiding your hair
like that in the tub anymore.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.626
No!
I love it so much!

19:21.628 --> 19:23.294
Baby, she...
she wrote "Bow" in my hair.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- And the way she scratches my...

19:25.965 --> 19:27.031
you need to let that go, okay?

19:27.033 --> 19:29.033
You look crazy in braids.
- No, I don't.

amazing with the babies.

that maybe you could
