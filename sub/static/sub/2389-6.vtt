00:01.135 --> 00:02.281
TED:
<i>Look at this,</i>

00:02.282 --> 00:04.248
your wedding weekend.
I know.

00:04.301 --> 00:06.552
This close to finally
having sex again.

00:06.554 --> 00:07.987
It's been forever.

00:07.989 --> 00:09.522
Oh, you and Robin
been abstaining?

00:09.524 --> 00:10.489
Talking about you, Ted.

00:10.491 --> 00:12.641
Now here's the deal:
every hookup

00:12.643 --> 00:15.477
at a weekend wedding is decided
at Friday night drinks.

00:15.479 --> 00:17.113
Get stuck with
the wrong girl

00:17.115 --> 00:19.481
tonight, the only action you'll
be getting all weekend

00:19.483 --> 00:22.151
is a self-five,
and I don't mean the cool kind.

00:22.153 --> 00:24.704
(chuckles)
Self-five! That's the cool kind.

00:24.706 --> 00:26.172
Well, that's a big decision.

00:26.174 --> 00:28.124
The biggest.

00:28.126 --> 00:31.460
It brings to mind
that religious text

00:31.462 --> 00:33.512
which we hold most sacred:

00:33.514 --> 00:36.983
<i>Indiana Jones and</i>
<i>the Last Crusade.</i>

00:36.985 --> 00:39.685
Remember?
They entered a chamber.

00:39.687 --> 00:42.504
Really? I'm the one working
with the Nazis?

00:42.506 --> 00:45.725
Ted, just... just... okay?

00:45.727 --> 00:48.010
Yeah.
They had to choose

00:48.012 --> 00:50.345
which cup was
this special cup.

00:50.347 --> 00:51.864
I forget what
it was called,

00:51.866 --> 00:53.699
but it's like the
Holy Grail of cups.

00:53.701 --> 00:56.535
It was the Holy Grail.
Of cups, exactly.

00:56.537 --> 00:59.705
So the Nazi confederate
chose, and...

00:59.707 --> 01:01.991
(quietly):
Please don't make me do that...

01:01.993 --> 01:04.459
Ted, Ted, the confederate
Nazi chose, and...? - I...

01:04.462 --> 01:06.045
Okay, okay.

01:06.047 --> 01:07.696
Oh.

01:12.419 --> 01:13.869
And so now I'm gonna explode.

01:13.871 --> 01:15.254
(explosion sounds)

01:15.256 --> 01:17.006
He chose...

01:17.008 --> 01:18.474
poorly.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.561
Then Indy picked
a cup, and...

01:26.549 --> 01:28.317
You chose...

01:28.319 --> 01:29.718
wisely.

01:32.639 --> 01:34.640
(playing surf guitar)

01:36.676 --> 01:38.060
So choose wisely, Ted.

01:38.062 --> 01:41.113
To help you decide,
I spent all day yesterday

01:41.115 --> 01:42.531
picking your top
three prospects.

01:42.533 --> 01:43.616
And I helped.

01:43.618 --> 01:45.701
It was either that
or writing our vows.

01:45.703 --> 01:46.752
Uch! Gag.

01:46.754 --> 01:50.039
Sophia was Robin's
college roommate,

01:50.041 --> 01:53.092
and she's apparently "a bit
of a screamer" in the sack.

01:53.094 --> 01:54.409
Yeah, mid-sex,

01:54.411 --> 01:56.679
she sounds exactly like
a car alarm from the '90s.

01:56.681 --> 02:01.767
You know, whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo,
ooh-uh, ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah.

02:01.769 --> 02:03.418
Dudes love it.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.522
Cassie is the daughter
of my mom's best friend.

02:06.524 --> 02:09.809
Sad story: 12 years ago,
her gymnast career

02:09.811 --> 02:13.963
was tragically cut short
when her boobs got too big.

02:14.981 --> 02:16.265
Grace is a new coworker.

02:16.267 --> 02:19.285
She's had six different
positions at the firm,

02:19.287 --> 02:21.403
and that was just at
the Christmas party.

02:21.405 --> 02:22.655
Ooh.

02:22.657 --> 02:24.573
So, Grace doesn't arrive till later,
Mm-hmm.

02:24.575 --> 02:27.159
I recommend
(whistles) Sophia.

02:27.161 --> 02:31.914
I strongly feel that you
should strongly feel her.

02:31.916 --> 02:33.916
I guess it's decided, then.

02:33.918 --> 02:35.701
Ted, right?
Yeah.

02:35.703 --> 02:37.336
I'm Cassie.

02:37.338 --> 02:39.588
Oh... something tells me

02:39.590 --> 02:42.975
that we are gonna have a lot
of fun this weekend. (chuckles)

02:45.178 --> 02:47.062
(quietly):
Cassie. I pick Cassie.

02:49.983 --> 02:52.134
You chose...

02:52.136 --> 02:54.103
poorly.

03:08.869 --> 03:10.319
Hey, there's our minister.

03:10.321 --> 03:12.588
Oh, what a sweet-looking old...

03:13.456 --> 03:15.624
Ah! He looks scary.

03:15.626 --> 03:16.992
Looks can be
deceiving, Lily.

03:16.994 --> 03:18.327
But not in this case.

03:18.329 --> 03:19.795
He's a mean old tool.

03:21.398 --> 03:24.383
Oh, he can't be that bad.

03:24.385 --> 03:26.685
I'll get him to come around.
Just...

03:28.004 --> 03:29.605
Hi, Reverend,

03:29.607 --> 03:32.141
I'm Lily Aldrin,
the maid of honor.

03:32.143 --> 03:33.809
Not too much honor.

03:33.811 --> 03:36.045
You're dressed like a whore.

03:37.647 --> 03:39.448
(mouthing)

03:41.535 --> 03:43.669
So what's going on?
Why aren't you telling your wife

03:43.671 --> 03:45.004
you got an offer to be a judge?

03:45.006 --> 03:47.506
Lily had her heart set
on us moving to Rome,

03:47.508 --> 03:49.341
so I have to tell her in person.

03:49.343 --> 03:51.627
That way, I know that I can
convince her

03:51.629 --> 03:53.229
that we need to stay.

03:53.231 --> 03:56.582
In the courtroom,
they call me The Convincer.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.500
They really call you that?

03:58.502 --> 04:01.587
I convinced them
to call me that.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.272
But you have to prepare
for your court cases.

04:03.274 --> 04:05.641
Did you prepare
for talking to Lily?

04:05.643 --> 04:06.909
I don't need to prepare, okay?

04:06.911 --> 04:09.545
I can craft a nice...

04:09.547 --> 04:11.080
thingy.

04:12.349 --> 04:14.133
Oh, wow I'm totally...

04:14.135 --> 04:15.601
the twisty metal thingy?

04:15.603 --> 04:16.517
You're screwed.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.103
I'm screwed!

04:18.105 --> 04:19.688
(both laughing)

04:19.690 --> 04:21.723
I'm sorry, Ted, I don't know.

04:21.725 --> 04:23.859
I'm just so tired
of this routine:

04:23.861 --> 04:25.727
we flirt, we have a few drinks,

04:25.729 --> 04:28.080
and then we end the night
with meaningless sex.

04:28.082 --> 04:30.199
Oh...

04:30.201 --> 04:32.334
yeah.

04:32.336 --> 04:33.919
Me, too.

04:33.921 --> 04:36.338
Do you want to start the night
with meaningless sex

04:36.340 --> 04:37.623
and then flirt later?

04:37.625 --> 04:38.907
You are a visionary.

04:38.909 --> 04:40.326
(laughs)

04:40.328 --> 04:41.327
Come on.

04:41.329 --> 04:42.344
(phone rings)

04:42.346 --> 04:44.630
Oh! Oh! It's work.

04:44.632 --> 04:46.749
Should I get it or ignore it?

04:46.751 --> 04:48.583
Or get it? Oh, or ignore it?

04:48.585 --> 04:49.885
Um...
Forget it?

04:49.887 --> 04:51.270
You know? Go ahead, get it.

04:51.272 --> 04:52.688
Okay. (clears throat)

04:52.690 --> 04:54.223
Hello?

04:55.225 --> 04:57.092
You chose...

04:57.094 --> 04:58.327
poorly.

04:58.329 --> 05:00.579
I'm fired?

05:00.581 --> 05:02.481
But teaching there
was my dream job!

05:02.483 --> 05:04.566
And you guys
are my only friends.

05:04.568 --> 05:07.602
You all hate me?

05:07.604 --> 05:09.989
Can I at least say
good-bye to all my kids?

05:09.991 --> 05:13.492
My kids all hate me?!

05:13.494 --> 05:14.994
(sobbing)

05:14.996 --> 05:16.195
Oh!

05:16.197 --> 05:18.998
Oh. It's okay.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.669
So, what were we
about to do?

05:23.671 --> 05:26.005
I think it was
"meaningless" something?

05:26.007 --> 05:27.423
Meaningless socks? No.

05:27.425 --> 05:28.490
(sobbing)

05:28.492 --> 05:30.242
No, it wasn't
meaningless socks.

05:30.244 --> 05:32.344
Hey, hi, hi, hi.

05:32.346 --> 05:34.229
Um, so, a little problem.

05:34.231 --> 05:38.267
I was trying really hard
not to offend your minister...

05:38.269 --> 05:42.187
So how did you
and your husband meet?

05:42.189 --> 05:45.024
Oh, it was our first week
of college.

05:45.026 --> 05:47.493
<i>I needed help hooking up</i>
<i>my stereo,</i>

05:47.495 --> 05:51.030
<i>so I walked down the hall,</i>
<i>and I just knew</i>

05:51.032 --> 05:52.581
<i>I should knock</i>
<i>on this one door.</i>

05:52.583 --> 05:54.583
<i>Marshall opened it.</i>

05:54.585 --> 05:55.934
<i>It was destiny.</i>

05:55.936 --> 05:57.953
Hi.
Hi.

05:57.955 --> 06:00.673
We've been together ever since.

06:01.558 --> 06:03.175
Excuse me!

06:04.294 --> 06:06.095
What did I do wrong?

06:06.829 --> 06:09.348
What did <i>you</i> do wrong?

06:09.350 --> 06:12.051
We really wanted him
to marry us.

06:12.053 --> 06:14.353
His church has cute
coming out the wazoo,

06:14.355 --> 06:16.505
but when we met with him...

06:16.507 --> 06:18.340
No pets in my church.

06:18.342 --> 06:20.926
No casual attire in my church.

06:20.928 --> 06:24.013
No gum.
No sports logos...

06:24.015 --> 06:25.881
Reverend?
More like Never-end.

06:25.883 --> 06:28.567
Prayer-five.
No shouting. No cell phones.

06:28.569 --> 06:29.618
I'll warn you

06:29.620 --> 06:32.855
that I turn down
most wedding requests.

06:32.857 --> 06:36.425
Particularly from boozy,
promiscuous Manhattanites

06:36.427 --> 06:38.911
who only want me
to marry them because

06:38.913 --> 06:43.248
my church has "cute
coming out the wazoo."

06:43.250 --> 06:46.502
That is the total
opposite of us.

06:46.504 --> 06:49.054
People are like that?

06:49.056 --> 06:50.622
Well, then,
how did you two meet?

06:50.624 --> 06:53.642
Oh, um, um...

06:53.644 --> 06:54.709
Um...

06:54.711 --> 06:57.146
Uh, we've been...
dating since college.

06:57.148 --> 06:59.848
We met the
very first week.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.368
<i>I needed help</i>
<i>hooking up my stereo,</i>

07:02.370 --> 07:05.687
<i>so I walked down the hall,</i>
<i>and I just knew</i>

07:05.689 --> 07:07.740
<i>that I should knock</i>
<i>on this one door.</i>

07:07.742 --> 07:09.575
BARNEY:
<i>I opened the door.</i>

07:09.577 --> 07:11.110
<i>And it was destiny.</i>

07:13.413 --> 07:14.763
Hi.

07:14.765 --> 07:16.448
Hi.

07:16.450 --> 07:18.733
BOTH:
We've been together ever since!

07:18.735 --> 07:21.069
You stole our story
of how we met?!

07:21.071 --> 07:23.539
We had to! Your story is so sweet!
Mm.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.407
You didn't even kiss
till the third date.

07:25.409 --> 07:27.242
By our third date,
I'd hit more bases

07:27.244 --> 07:29.945
than Bob Hope on a USO tour.
Topical.

07:29.947 --> 07:32.247
Now Reverend Lowell
knows that we lied to him.

07:32.249 --> 07:34.500
What if he cancels
our wedding?

07:34.502 --> 07:36.218
What? That's ridiculous.

07:36.220 --> 07:37.519
Barney, Robin,
I need to speak

07:37.521 --> 07:39.555
with you in private immediately.

07:40.890 --> 07:42.274
And it's not just
losing my job,

07:42.276 --> 07:45.694
my car just got stolen
with all my stuff in it.

07:45.696 --> 07:47.629
And now I think
I'm getting the flu!

07:47.631 --> 07:49.431
I'm sorry.

07:49.433 --> 07:51.567
I've been talking
for, like, a half an hour.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.752
It's fine.
40 minutes. It's fine.

07:53.754 --> 07:56.538
Still, I think I would be able
to handle all of this

07:56.540 --> 08:01.577
(voice breaks): if my boyfriend Wesley
hadn't just broken up with me!

08:01.579 --> 08:03.796
(sobs softly)

08:05.948 --> 08:07.583
(inhales deeply)

08:10.420 --> 08:12.621
Why don't you tell me about it?

08:12.623 --> 08:15.507
Okay! I should go back
to the beginning.

08:15.509 --> 08:17.176
Oh, no, before the beginning.

08:17.178 --> 08:18.560
Winter, 1998...

08:18.562 --> 08:20.128
<i>Man, this girl is a drag!</i>

08:20.130 --> 08:24.233
If I hurry, I bet I still have
<i>a shot with Sophia.</i>

08:24.235 --> 08:26.768
<i>Okay, I'll get one more drink</i>
<i>with Cassie, then bail.</i>

08:26.770 --> 08:28.353
But where, bar or dining room?

08:28.355 --> 08:30.606
<i>Bar or dining room?</i>

08:30.608 --> 08:32.857
For my fourth date
with Wesley, we went...

08:32.860 --> 08:36.028
Cassie, let's get one more drink
in the dining room.

08:36.030 --> 08:37.880
You chose...

08:39.866 --> 08:41.033
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

08:41.034 --> 08:43.118
Hey! We just ordered
appetizers.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.253
Sit down, you two!

08:45.288 --> 08:47.623
...Ha-poorly!

08:50.344 --> 08:53.017
Marshall, you're walking into
the biggest fight of your life.

08:53.018 --> 08:55.602
You have to be prepared.
You have to be tough.

08:55.604 --> 08:57.220
I am tough!
No, you're not.

08:57.222 --> 08:58.388
You make some good points.

08:58.390 --> 09:00.257
Now, what exactly
are you gonna say to Lily

09:00.259 --> 09:01.524
when you walk
through that door?

09:01.526 --> 09:03.143
Okay.

09:03.145 --> 09:04.344
Hey, baby.

09:04.346 --> 09:05.862
So, listen,
I got this phone call...

09:05.864 --> 09:07.330
DAPHNE:
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

09:07.332 --> 09:08.565
You haven't seen her in a week.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.901
Where's the "I missed you"?
How about a kiss?

09:10.903 --> 09:12.786
Nothing about her new hairstyle?

09:12.788 --> 09:14.237
Hairstyle?
I can't actually see...

09:14.239 --> 09:15.322
Start over!

09:15.873 --> 09:17.774
Lily! Hi.

09:17.776 --> 09:19.042
Mmm.

09:19.044 --> 09:20.043
I missed you.

09:20.045 --> 09:22.462
And your hairstyle so much.

09:22.464 --> 09:23.713
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
I missed you, too.

09:23.715 --> 09:27.150
I can't wait to show you
how much in bed tonight.

09:27.152 --> 09:28.418
Okay, that's creepy.

09:28.420 --> 09:29.552
Don't break character.

09:29.554 --> 09:31.137
Okay, um...

09:31.139 --> 09:33.957
So, listen, I got this
phone call last week, and I...

09:33.959 --> 09:35.342
DAPHNE:
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

09:35.344 --> 09:37.177
Acknowledge her own views
on the matter first.

09:37.179 --> 09:38.595
Start over.

09:39.363 --> 09:40.847
Lily, hi, mwah.

09:40.849 --> 09:42.315
I missed you
and your hairstyle so much.

09:42.317 --> 09:43.800
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
I missed you, too.

09:43.802 --> 09:46.670
Okay, so, I know
that you're excited for Rome.

09:46.672 --> 09:48.521
I'm more excited
for bed tonight.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.109
While I was away,
uh, I got a phone call.

09:53.111 --> 09:54.828
To be a judge.

09:54.830 --> 09:56.012
What the damn hell?!

09:56.014 --> 09:57.146
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:57.148 --> 09:59.332
Lily does not say
"What the damn hell."

09:59.334 --> 10:00.917
Well, I've never met her
but, yes, she does.

10:00.919 --> 10:02.585
You make some good points.
Wow.

10:02.587 --> 10:04.387
You are terrible at this.

10:05.339 --> 10:06.823
(sighs)
Why did we lie?

10:06.825 --> 10:08.291
We have to come clean.

10:08.293 --> 10:10.944
Frankly,
I am appalled.

10:10.946 --> 10:12.345
I know. I...
Your friend

10:12.347 --> 10:15.899
Lily just tried to pass off
your sweet story

10:15.901 --> 10:18.852
of how you met as her own.

10:19.971 --> 10:22.639
That lying little tart!
I am horrified and relieved!

10:22.641 --> 10:26.609
Does Lily have any... problems
that you're aware of?

10:26.611 --> 10:27.861
Drinking.
Drugs.

10:27.863 --> 10:31.180
BOTH:
She's been drinking drugs.

10:31.182 --> 10:32.449
LOWELL:
<i>Well,</i>

10:32.451 --> 10:34.350
I talked to Barney
and Robin,

10:34.352 --> 10:36.369
and, let me say, I'm shocked.

10:36.371 --> 10:37.871
You should be.

10:37.873 --> 10:39.656
Flat-out lying to me like that?

10:39.658 --> 10:41.755
We are not misunderstanding
each other.

10:41.780 --> 10:45.263
How dare you pretend their
beautiful story is actually your own.

10:45.363 --> 10:47.047
Come again for Lil' Fudge?
(chuckles)

10:47.049 --> 10:48.465
I understand the temptation.

10:48.467 --> 10:50.366
They're such a sweet couple.

10:50.368 --> 10:51.885
I mean, the way
they call each other

10:51.887 --> 10:54.387
Barnmallow and Robinpad.

10:54.389 --> 10:56.706
(chuckles)
Oh.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.374
LILY:
Yes.

10:58.376 --> 11:00.677
I do steal
their stories.

11:00.679 --> 11:02.395
Mm-hmm.
But only because

11:02.397 --> 11:03.763
my husband and I

11:03.765 --> 11:06.883
are so ashamed
of how we met.

11:06.885 --> 11:09.853
<i>See, we only met</i>
<i>because his friend Ted</i>

11:09.855 --> 11:11.187
<i>fell in love with me.</i>

11:11.189 --> 11:12.906
<i>And who could blame him?</i>

11:12.908 --> 11:14.107
Hey, Marshall.

11:14.109 --> 11:15.275
See that girl?

11:15.277 --> 11:16.693
Oh, yeah.

11:16.695 --> 11:18.578
You just know
she likes it dirty.

11:18.580 --> 11:19.896
Go say hi.
What?

11:19.898 --> 11:21.934
I can't just go say hi.
I-I need a plan.

11:21.935 --> 11:22.443
Hmm.

11:22.468 --> 11:23.834
I'm gonna wait until
she goes to the bathroom...

11:23.835 --> 11:24.834
Hi.

11:24.836 --> 11:26.536
Have you met Ted?

11:26.538 --> 11:28.071
MARSHALL:
I'm sorry,

11:28.073 --> 11:30.090
I can't...

11:30.092 --> 11:31.591
LILY:
And now, after years of lying,

11:31.593 --> 11:32.909
<i>cheating and backsliding,</i>

11:32.911 --> 11:34.227
<i>here we are, married!</i>

11:34.229 --> 11:35.962
But what can I say?

11:35.964 --> 11:37.797
My husband's a sociopath

11:37.799 --> 11:39.265
who's slept with over
a hundred women,

11:39.267 --> 11:42.552
and I'm a slut who once let
my boss feel me up.

11:42.554 --> 11:43.603
Oh, come on!

11:43.605 --> 11:45.555
I felt <i>him</i> up!
It is over 250 women!

11:45.557 --> 11:47.857
If you two want to get married
in my church,

11:47.859 --> 11:49.926
you'll stop breaking
the ninth commandment.

11:49.928 --> 11:51.644
Uh...
no fat chicks?

11:51.646 --> 11:53.146
Thou shalt not lie!

11:53.148 --> 11:55.431
With fat chicks?

11:55.433 --> 11:57.817
You're killing me.
You're killing me.

11:57.819 --> 11:58.952
Now that...

11:58.954 --> 12:00.436
was a good dessert.
(Cassie sighs)

12:00.438 --> 12:03.289
"Dessert" sounds like "desert."

12:03.291 --> 12:06.776
The desert
has sand...

12:06.778 --> 12:08.812
there's sand
at the beach...

12:08.814 --> 12:10.880
and Wesley and I

12:10.882 --> 12:13.049
once drove by a beach.

12:13.051 --> 12:14.050
(sobbing)

12:14.052 --> 12:15.952
Excuse me.

12:15.954 --> 12:18.004
(sobbing)

12:18.006 --> 12:19.789
TED:
<i>Now's my chance to leave.</i>

12:19.791 --> 12:21.257
No, I'll wait five more seconds

12:21.259 --> 12:22.675
<i>so I don't seem too eager.</i>

12:22.677 --> 12:23.643
<i>Four...</i>

12:23.645 --> 12:24.677
<i>three...</i>

12:24.679 --> 12:25.812
<i>two...</i>

12:25.814 --> 12:27.730
Well, thanks for keeping
our daughter company.

12:27.732 --> 12:29.132
Man, she can be
a real drag, huh?

12:29.134 --> 12:32.318
We're gonna go have
a little fun. See ya!

12:33.571 --> 12:34.904
(laughing)

12:34.906 --> 12:37.657
You're on fire tonight, bro.

12:38.742 --> 12:41.027
But, Lily, being a judge
is my dream job.

12:41.029 --> 12:42.529
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
So your dream job

12:42.531 --> 12:44.114
is more important
than my dream job?

12:44.116 --> 12:46.116
Exactly.
Now you're getting it.

12:46.118 --> 12:47.534
(clucks tongue)
Nope.

12:47.536 --> 12:48.551
Start over.

12:48.553 --> 12:50.036
So your dream job's

12:50.038 --> 12:51.838
more important
than my dream job?

12:51.840 --> 12:54.541
But, baby, you already have
the best job in the world:

12:54.543 --> 12:56.009
Mom.
Nope.

12:56.011 --> 12:57.076
Start over.

12:57.078 --> 12:58.962
So your dream job's
more important

12:58.964 --> 13:00.096
than my dream job?

13:00.098 --> 13:03.166
Hey, I gave up peeing
in the shower for you.

13:03.168 --> 13:04.184
Nope.

13:04.186 --> 13:05.218
Start over.

13:05.220 --> 13:06.553
So your dream job's

13:06.555 --> 13:08.388
more important
than my dream job?

13:08.390 --> 13:09.505
Of course not.

13:09.507 --> 13:10.740
But this isn't

13:10.742 --> 13:12.475
just about our future.

13:12.477 --> 13:14.060
It's about everyone's.

13:14.062 --> 13:15.061
As a lawyer,

13:15.063 --> 13:16.729
I couldn't stop big oil
from polluting,

13:16.731 --> 13:18.231
but as a judge...

13:18.233 --> 13:19.482
well, maybe I can.

13:19.484 --> 13:21.284
And that's why I took the job.

13:22.019 --> 13:23.186
You've just been "convincered."

13:23.188 --> 13:24.487
Wait.

13:24.489 --> 13:26.372
You already took the job?

13:26.374 --> 13:28.158
Without even talking
to your wife?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.859
Start over.

13:29.861 --> 13:31.244
Start over... start over.

13:31.246 --> 13:33.213
What the damn hell?!

13:34.748 --> 13:36.299
Hi, Reverend
Lowell?

13:36.301 --> 13:38.301
Whew.
Made it through my half.

13:38.303 --> 13:39.869
You're up.

13:39.871 --> 13:41.054
Oh. Uh...

13:41.056 --> 13:43.289
The-the truth is,
we-we have

13:43.291 --> 13:45.141
a complicated,
messy history

13:45.143 --> 13:46.726
that-that we're
not too proud of.

13:46.728 --> 13:48.011
But...

13:48.013 --> 13:49.345
we're sorry
that we lied,

13:49.347 --> 13:52.999
and hope that
you can forgive us.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.904
Nope, I can't do it.

13:57.906 --> 13:59.939
You're going to have
to find a new officiant.

13:59.941 --> 14:01.224
Okay.

14:01.226 --> 14:02.325
Well, these
things happen.

14:02.327 --> 14:03.359
And a new church.

14:03.361 --> 14:05.828
What the damn hell?!

14:06.780 --> 14:09.749
TED: <i>This evening could not</i>
<i>get any worse.</i>

14:09.751 --> 14:11.618
Whenever you're ready.
Crap!

14:13.721 --> 14:14.871
Hey, Ted.

14:14.873 --> 14:16.589
Thanks for
being so great.

14:16.591 --> 14:18.608
I'm lucky to have you
around this weekend.

14:18.610 --> 14:20.593
Ooh, yeah...

14:20.595 --> 14:22.095
About that...

14:22.097 --> 14:25.014
I should really go see
about the, uh...

14:25.016 --> 14:26.883
So, sex?
My room is very close.

14:26.885 --> 14:28.635
(Cassie laughs)

14:28.637 --> 14:29.903
TED:
Sophia. Hi.

14:29.905 --> 14:31.221
Oh, God. Wesley.

14:31.223 --> 14:33.523
Wait. Wait, you're Wesley?

14:33.525 --> 14:35.058
Hey, Cassie.
(laughs nervously)

14:35.060 --> 14:37.260
Your parents were just saying
you have a new boyfriend.

14:37.262 --> 14:39.646
"Boyfriend" is
a little premature.

14:39.648 --> 14:40.980
Though I did
pay for dinner.

14:40.982 --> 14:43.432
Ted and I are
very happy.

14:43.434 --> 14:44.784
Are we?

14:44.786 --> 14:48.071
(crying): Even if... he'll
never replace you.

14:48.073 --> 14:50.456
(sobbing)

14:52.509 --> 14:53.826
So, Sophia. Hi.

14:53.828 --> 14:54.844
I'm Ted.

14:54.846 --> 14:56.713
Robin's friend.

14:56.715 --> 14:58.447
What do you say we give
these two old flames

14:58.449 --> 15:00.383
a chance to...
catch up alone,

15:00.385 --> 15:01.968
and maybe you and I
could go get a drink.

15:01.970 --> 15:03.386
Are you hitting on me?
Dude!

15:03.388 --> 15:04.671
Ted, let's go!

15:08.642 --> 15:10.877
You tip...

15:10.879 --> 15:12.061
(scoffs)

15:12.063 --> 15:13.680
...poorly.

15:17.704 --> 15:20.012
Look, I know. I shouldn't
have taken the job

15:20.013 --> 15:21.095
without telling Lily.

15:21.097 --> 15:22.847
Why are you so ticked off
about it?

15:22.849 --> 15:25.016
Because I know
what she's going through.

15:25.018 --> 15:26.067
I always dreamed

15:26.069 --> 15:28.620
of having a career
I could be proud of,

15:28.622 --> 15:30.705
but my husband never
supported me.

15:30.707 --> 15:31.890
Eventually,

15:31.892 --> 15:34.676
I had to... make a choice.

15:34.678 --> 15:35.743
Now, every day,

15:35.745 --> 15:36.961
I'm out there,

15:36.963 --> 15:39.130
I'm fighting for the good guys,
and I love it.

15:39.132 --> 15:40.398
Doesn't

15:40.400 --> 15:41.916
your wife deserve th, too?

15:41.918 --> 15:46.004
Wow. Um, maybe
you're right.

15:46.006 --> 15:49.340
I didn't realize how many
sacrifices you'd made.

15:50.359 --> 15:51.976
What is it you do, anyway?

15:51.978 --> 15:53.761
I'm a lobbyist
for a big oil company.

15:53.763 --> 15:55.379
What the damn hell?!

15:57.382 --> 15:58.733
You know
that I'm an environmentalist!

15:58.735 --> 16:00.384
That's why you don't want me
to become a judge.

16:00.386 --> 16:02.219
But you're the reason
I <i>have</i> to become a judge!

16:02.221 --> 16:04.689
You're the devil incarnate!
And outcarnate!

16:04.691 --> 16:06.891
Every kind of carnate!

16:08.460 --> 16:09.644
Please, is-is there

16:09.646 --> 16:10.878
any way you'd reconsider?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.580
No! No, no!

16:12.582 --> 16:14.749
You two are both
terrible people.

16:14.751 --> 16:17.819
Who found each other
in this crazy world!

16:17.821 --> 16:19.170
Aw!

16:19.172 --> 16:21.739
And who lie
about <i>how</i> they found each other.

16:21.741 --> 16:23.958
So, please leave now. Just...

16:23.960 --> 16:26.044
Ugh! Ugh!

16:26.046 --> 16:28.346
You know what?
You're right.

16:28.348 --> 16:30.748
We shouldn't have lied
about our story.

16:31.433 --> 16:32.850
I <i>love</i> our story.

16:32.852 --> 16:34.802
Sure, it's messy,
but it's the story

16:34.804 --> 16:37.188
that got us here,
about to get married.

16:37.190 --> 16:39.524
I love it, too.

16:39.526 --> 16:41.492
Every messy chapter.

16:41.494 --> 16:43.978
I love that you slept
with over 250 women

16:43.980 --> 16:46.114
before deciding that
I was your favorite.

16:46.116 --> 16:47.282
This is killing me.

16:47.284 --> 16:48.833
And I love
that we just had

16:48.835 --> 16:50.434
to keep having sex
with each other,

16:50.436 --> 16:51.903
even when we were dating
other people.

16:51.905 --> 16:53.437
This is <i>really</i> killing me.

16:53.439 --> 16:55.106
And I love that your
marriage proposal

16:55.108 --> 16:57.208
involved a strip
club, lying to me,

16:57.210 --> 17:01.095
and pretending to bang the
woman I <i>hate</i> for two months.

17:01.097 --> 17:02.664
I love that we keep
a running tally

17:02.666 --> 17:04.248
of all the different rooms
we've had sex in.

17:04.250 --> 17:07.502
I love that two weeks ago, we
put this room on that list.

17:07.503 --> 17:09.420
Huh? Come on, Rev.

17:09.422 --> 17:11.622
That's got to be worth
some kind of reaction, right?

17:11.624 --> 17:13.858
I mean, right where
your hymnal is, is where we...

17:13.859 --> 17:16.010
we...

17:17.896 --> 17:20.064

17:33.496 --> 17:36.664
(crying and kissing)

17:36.666 --> 17:38.750
(crying, sniffling,
kissing)

17:38.752 --> 17:40.651
Um, are...
are you okay?

17:40.653 --> 17:43.955
I think... think maybe seeing
your ex was a bit much for you.

17:43.957 --> 17:46.174
No. Not at all.

17:46.176 --> 17:48.176
I want... only you.

17:48.178 --> 17:49.927
Oh, yeah.

17:49.929 --> 17:53.097
I want to...
I want to rock your world.

17:53.099 --> 17:55.433
And you're so hot.
(sniffling)

17:55.435 --> 17:59.137
I want to ride you
like a bronco.

17:59.139 --> 18:01.422
(sobbing)
Okay, Cassie. Cassie.

18:01.424 --> 18:03.507
Yeah, we...
we can't do this.

18:03.509 --> 18:04.809
I mean, you're crying.

18:04.811 --> 18:06.060
(coughing)

18:06.062 --> 18:07.445
And contagious.

18:07.447 --> 18:08.780
You're-you're having

18:08.782 --> 18:10.148
a really, really bad week.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.150
I think... I think
you should just

18:12.152 --> 18:14.752
take it easy.

18:14.754 --> 18:15.870
You're right.

18:15.872 --> 18:18.373
I'm not in a good place.
No.

18:18.375 --> 18:19.457
Oh, wow.

18:19.459 --> 18:21.459
I probably would have
let you do

18:21.461 --> 18:24.195
all sorts of crazy things to me.

18:24.197 --> 18:26.381
(sighs)

18:27.549 --> 18:29.300
Exactly.

18:29.302 --> 18:31.335
I release you.

18:31.337 --> 18:33.638
Go have fun this weekend.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.223
Meet someone else.

18:35.225 --> 18:37.058
TED: <i>Yes! Yes! Be cool.</i>
Okay.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.060
NARRATOR: <i>But I couldn't</i>
<i>meet someone else.</i>

18:39.062 --> 18:41.062
Hey, Ted?
Yeah.

18:41.064 --> 18:42.213
Everyone here is saying

18:42.215 --> 18:44.515
you and Cassie are the
couple of the weekend.

18:44.517 --> 18:45.850
How great is that?

18:45.852 --> 18:47.735
NARRATOR:
<i>Barney was right.</i>

18:47.737 --> 18:50.605
<i>I'd chosen poorly,</i>
<i>everyone had seen us together,</i>

18:50.607 --> 18:52.723
<i>and now the whole weekend</i>
<i>seemed lost.</i>

18:52.725 --> 18:55.159
<i>Until...</i>

18:55.161 --> 18:57.561
Hi. I just got here.

18:57.563 --> 18:59.447
Did I miss anything?

18:59.449 --> 19:02.417
Not at all. Grace, right?

19:02.419 --> 19:05.620
I'm Ted. Let's get you a drink
before you talk to anyone else

19:05.622 --> 19:07.839
or hear anything.

19:09.174 --> 19:10.858
Hey, guys.
How's your night going?

19:10.860 --> 19:12.176
Ugh!
Ugh!

19:12.178 --> 19:13.928
Our minister just died.

19:13.930 --> 19:15.913
Wh...?
We can still use the church,

19:15.915 --> 19:17.765
but we only have two days
to find a new officiant.

19:17.767 --> 19:19.133
Unless...

19:19.243 --> 19:20.334
BARNEY:
Wedding at Bernie's!

19:20.335 --> 19:21.835
We're not doing
Wedding at Bernie's!

19:21.837 --> 19:24.754
Wow. Oh, that's terrible.

19:24.756 --> 19:26.723
Should I make a toast
in his honor?

19:26.725 --> 19:28.308
(whispers):
No.

19:28.310 --> 19:29.726
Of course I should.

19:30.678 --> 19:32.128
Everyone?

19:32.130 --> 19:33.763
To Reverend Lowell.

19:33.765 --> 19:35.732
He may have
passed away

19:35.734 --> 19:37.133
tonight, but
he will always...

19:37.135 --> 19:39.169
Uncle Robert died?!

19:39.987 --> 19:41.571
Oh, no.

19:41.573 --> 19:43.907
(crying)

19:46.878 --> 19:48.811
(high-pitched crying)

19:48.813 --> 19:50.030
(sobbing)

19:50.032 --> 19:51.832
Have a nice weekend.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.784
NARRATOR: <i>All that night, I did nothing</i>
<i>but choose poorly.</i>

19:54.786 --> 19:56.169
<i>But thanks to Cassie,</i>

19:56.171 --> 19:58.722
<i>I didn't get together</i>
<i>with anyone at that wedding.</i>

19:58.724 --> 20:00.040
<i>And if I had,</i>

20:00.042 --> 20:04.127
<i>well, then, your mother</i>
<i>and I might never have met.</i>

20:04.129 --> 20:07.997
<i>So, maybe, in a way,</i>
<i>I chose wisely.</i>

20:08.712 --> 20:11.692
SOPHIA:
Boo-uh! Boo-uh! Eee!

20:11.693 --> 20:13.526
<i>Although, it sure as heck</i>

20:13.528 --> 20:14.745
<i>didn't feel like it</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

20:14.746 --> 20:16.029
Aah! Aah! Aah!

20:16.031 --> 20:17.664
(sighs)

20:17.666 --> 20:19.532
She chose...

20:19.534 --> 20:20.917
Wesley.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.285
(chuckling)

20:22.287 --> 20:24.838
I've been dying
to say that one all night.

20:26.657 --> 20:28.625
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

20:28.627 --> 20:29.992
The truth is, you're right.

20:29.994 --> 20:32.829
It was wrong of me to take
that job without telling Lily.

20:32.831 --> 20:35.799
I don't need to be tough
with her. I need to be fair.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.434
Thanks, Marshall.
Mm.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.552
I should also apologize.

20:39.554 --> 20:41.771
While you were filling the tank,

20:41.773 --> 20:44.357
I may have been so angry,

20:44.359 --> 20:47.544
I texted your wife with the news

20:47.546 --> 20:50.213
that you took that judge offer.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.032
(phone ringing)

20:52.034 --> 20:53.950
Don't forget
to compliment her hair.
