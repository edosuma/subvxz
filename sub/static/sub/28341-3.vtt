WEBVTT

00:01.066 --> 00:03.519
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.599
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

00:05.600 --> 00:07.839
within an organised crime group.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.020
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.440
Go, go, go!

00:20.120 --> 00:21.439
Drinks are on me, lads.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.039
- Who am I talking to?
- Just answer.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.519
We're tooled up, ready for a raid.
I want to plan it.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.841
He believed he was on to the top man.

00:32.842 --> 00:34.919
- Who?
- Just a code name.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.119
H?

00:36.120 --> 00:37.319
Hilton.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.399
He was the senior police officer
who was running

00:39.400 --> 00:42.519
the show for organised crime.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.532
H, finally.

00:44.533 --> 00:45.900
Well done, everybody.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.119
My senior legal counsel, Gill Biggeloe.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.100
You don't mind if she sits in?

00:53.200 --> 00:55.760
I'm here to ask you one more time
to sign the papers.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.239
Since retiring, I've joined a mate's
property development business,

01:05.239 --> 01:08.879
and one of our new projects
is the Kettle Bell Complex.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.660
Our terms of business include
compensating the original investors.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.599
Detective Chief
Superintendent Hargreaves.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.799
Gaffer thinks he knows the
magic words to make them talk.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.200
Don't they all?

01:23.400 --> 01:26.240
- I'll call you.
- By the hairs on your chinny-chin-chin!

01:31.040 --> 01:32.919
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.599
The top brass,
they don't want me to succeed.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.100
There's a bent copper running
organised crime, I'm sure of it.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.879
Everything I've said is
the God's honest truth,

01:42.880 --> 01:46.220
and I'll prove it. But that depends
if you've got the guts to listen.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.500
Or are you just another lap dog
for Hastings and the rest of them?

01:52.040 --> 01:54.559
I've been developing a CHIS
who hears things about the OCG.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.079
Someone I should know about?

01:56.080 --> 01:58.439
No. Definitely not something
to bother a DI about.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.679
We'll go after the bent bastards,
whatever it takes.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.799
But once you're in,
there's no turning back.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.140
Are you in?

02:08.199 --> 02:12.039
KF-1 to KF-6 are a series of images
of individuals known to be part of

02:12.040 --> 02:15.399
a clandestine network
of corrupt police officers.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.080
PS Cafferty, do you see the person
who recruited you?

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.360 --> 02:29.640
Right, lads.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.359
The Eastfield Depot.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.599
Used by three police forces to store all

02:34.600 --> 02:36.130
the good stuff they use in evidence.

02:36.131 --> 02:39.359
Drugs, cash, jewels, precious metals.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.879
Proceeds of robberies.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.999
It's one of the most securely
guarded facilities in the area.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.599
But since we acquired a couple of
dozen automatic assault rifles from

02:48.600 --> 02:52.120
the ballistics job, well, then we've
got the firepower to get inside.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.220
This is a complicated job.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.260
No disrespect.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.340
None taken.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.599
After I came out of Altcourse,
I knocked up some false documents

03:02.600 --> 03:05.100
to help me brother out
with a security job in Iraq.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.199
We were guarding
high security facilities.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.519
I've seen what it takes to defend them,

03:10.520 --> 03:12.660
so I know what it takes to raid them.

03:13.240 --> 03:17.039
We've got these plans,
plus some basic information from

03:17.040 --> 03:18.919
the AFOs we've been using.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.839
There's a routine pick-up,
we've got the driver.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.279
Instead of the planned pick-up,

03:23.280 --> 03:25.999
we hijack the empty lorry to do our job.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.829
And higher levels of our organisation

03:28.830 --> 03:30.800
have bent coppers in their pocket.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.919
You just said we had the firepower.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.079
Yeah, but hopefully that's just for show.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.399
A big shoot-out'll bring
every copper in the area

03:38.400 --> 03:39.840
out on a blue light.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.440
We need time to load the lorry.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.180
Best way to do that is to get in quietly.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.040
That means inside men.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.940
You make the necessary contacts.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.060
Bent coppers.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.839
We could call her back in,
show her a range of images

03:58.840 --> 04:00.426
and try and make it evidential.

04:00.426 --> 04:01.785
- Sir.
- Sir.

04:01.786 --> 04:03.585
Yeah, you were saying?

04:03.586 --> 04:05.425
We've been following up on a possible ID

04:05.426 --> 04:06.705
made by PS Jane Cafferty.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.825
Yeah, well, I'm glad you're
getting round to that.

04:08.826 --> 04:11.185
The last time I looked,
I was still in charge around here.

04:11.186 --> 04:12.545
- Sir.
- Sir.

04:12.546 --> 04:14.785
To be fair, sir,
the ID wasn't evidential.

04:14.786 --> 04:17.425
Cafferty claims she was recruited
by a corrupt police officer

04:17.426 --> 04:19.766
with established links
to organised crime.

04:20.666 --> 04:23.385
I was pursuing a lead,
just covering all the possibilities.

04:23.386 --> 04:25.585
Some possibilities
being Cafferty's mistaken,

04:25.586 --> 04:27.426
or she's bargaining for immunity.

04:30.066 --> 04:31.945
Jesus Christ.

04:31.946 --> 04:34.545
Sorry, sir. That's why we held back.

04:34.546 --> 04:36.825
Look, Dot's a stick
for everyone to beat us with.

04:36.826 --> 04:38.773
They know he undermines our credibility.

04:38.774 --> 04:42.065
Yeah, well, no more skulking around, OK?

04:42.066 --> 04:45.126
- There's no secrets in AC-12.
- Sir.

05:10.586 --> 05:11.825
Sorry I'm late.

05:11.826 --> 05:13.806
You're all right. I'm early.

05:16.466 --> 05:17.785
Another?

05:17.786 --> 05:20.986
Well, let's wait and see if
we've something to celebrate first.

05:23.546 --> 05:25.306
- Yes, sir?
- Two more of those, please.

05:29.986 --> 05:32.985
We can secure your investment
with a deposit payment.

05:32.986 --> 05:34.526
I've got all the paperwork.

05:34.906 --> 05:36.426
What's the deposit?

05:36.451 --> 05:37.985
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

05:37.986 --> 05:40.225
Yeah, I know. How much?

05:40.226 --> 05:41.745
100 grand.

05:43.106 --> 05:45.625
Ted, wait, wait, wait.
There's a way around it.

05:45.626 --> 05:48.305
Part of the deal is to
recoup your original losses.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.425
We can set up a loan facility
against the credit you'll receive

05:51.426 --> 05:53.426
when those losses are paid back.

05:55.346 --> 05:56.905
Look, you've told me your situation.

05:56.906 --> 05:59.665
You've sold the family home,
you're living out of a hotel room,

05:59.666 --> 06:01.545
your missus is in a poky little flat.

06:01.546 --> 06:03.506
This'll put all that in reverse.

06:07.306 --> 06:09.145
We're both seasoned coppers.

06:09.146 --> 06:12.226
We've risked our lives and
stood all the crap they rain down.

06:14.906 --> 06:16.706
Haven't we earned a payday?

06:21.266 --> 06:22.906
What do I owe you?

06:40.705 --> 06:42.104
Any news?

06:42.105 --> 06:44.544
Yeah. Things are falling into place.

06:44.545 --> 06:47.225
I'm onto a bent copper
that can get us into Eastfield.

07:00.745 --> 07:02.305
OK.

07:09.585 --> 07:11.224
It's me. It's John Clayton.

07:11.512 --> 07:13.312
Can you hear me?

07:16.583 --> 07:19.583
_

07:25.311 --> 07:27.847
_

07:27.883 --> 07:29.464
Yeah, definitely.

07:29.465 --> 07:34.405
There's drugs, probably double figures.

07:35.584 --> 07:39.897
Cash, bullion, jewellery,
another set of double figures.

07:39.929 --> 07:41.765
Look, we're talking millions.

07:46.825 --> 07:51.184
As far as the risk goes, we can
minimise that by using your assets,

07:51.185 --> 07:52.665
bent coppers.

07:55.412 --> 07:59.132
Obviously, if you need anything
more from our end, well, then...

08:02.473 --> 08:04.050
_

08:04.945 --> 08:07.125
Great. Thanks.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.665
Any new orders for me?

08:16.370 --> 08:18.370
_

08:22.105 --> 08:26.085
Who is it, Lise?
Who am I giving all this info to?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.118
H?

08:30.145 --> 08:31.744
Truth is...

08:32.164 --> 08:33.965
...I don't know, John.

08:34.385 --> 08:36.705
For my own good,
I plan to keep it that way.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.365
I've had enough of this game.

08:42.825 --> 08:44.824
This is how he operates. He's one of us.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.305
Is he?

08:48.465 --> 08:49.865
Or is he one of them?

08:51.204 --> 08:52.804
Same thing...

08:56.025 --> 08:57.785
...if you're bent enough.

09:02.865 --> 09:05.304
This other copper you've got
on the Eastfield job,

09:05.305 --> 09:07.024
he'd best be there on the night.

09:07.025 --> 09:08.745
He's never going to go for that.

09:11.705 --> 09:14.325
He's got to be there, in the same trench,

09:14.825 --> 09:16.424
for our security.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.545
I'm not having this bent bastard
cross us.

09:20.945 --> 09:22.305
OK.

09:24.185 --> 09:25.585
Shit.

10:06.065 --> 10:08.144
- All right, mate?
- All right.

10:08.145 --> 10:10.345
It's a bit brass monkeys tonight,
isn't it?

10:12.585 --> 10:14.645
Right, no time for small talk.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.424
There's a girl on the unit.

10:17.425 --> 10:19.384
Name's Lisa McQueen.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.805
I've got her reaching out
to bent coppers.

10:22.345 --> 10:24.864
She's also the one that
makes contact with the

10:24.865 --> 10:27.024
higher levels of the organisation.

10:27.025 --> 10:29.024
- How?
- Laptop.

10:29.025 --> 10:32.885
We talk via an audio link.
The replies come up as a text.

10:34.025 --> 10:36.224
Any username or IP address?

10:36.225 --> 10:37.885
No, sorry, mate.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.565
This is McQueen's burner number.

10:42.025 --> 10:44.064
It's for surveillance only.

10:44.065 --> 10:47.344
Don't go making any kind of moves
without clearing it with me first.

10:47.345 --> 10:48.865
Got it.

10:49.905 --> 10:53.944
Look, John, the stuff you've done...

10:54.025 --> 10:55.624
...we're after you.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.998
It would be easier for you to
come in and work with all of us.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.277
No, no, no, way.

10:59.278 --> 11:01.464
Look, the deal we made, mate,
it's for keeps.

11:01.465 --> 11:04.024
We go after the bent bastards,
no matter how high,

11:04.025 --> 11:05.584
no matter what it takes.

11:05.585 --> 11:07.385
Look, we're in this together!

11:23.124 --> 11:25.365
_

11:30.265 --> 11:32.117
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

11:32.142 --> 11:34.224
We've been provided with the
metadata on the phone number

11:34.225 --> 11:35.624
you gave me for Lisa McQueen.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.784
All the numbers the user's
called recently

11:37.785 --> 11:40.664
are of the same type.
Unregistered, pay-as-you-go devices.

11:40.665 --> 11:41.697
Burner phones.

11:41.722 --> 11:43.264
And some have already
gone out of service,

11:43.265 --> 11:45.784
suggesting they use them for only
a few days at a time

11:45.785 --> 11:48.384
before disposing of them. But while
she remains on this device,

11:48.385 --> 11:50.744
we can identify her calls
and track her location.

11:50.745 --> 11:52.464
I've had signal strength triangulation

11:52.465 --> 11:54.904
authorised by the Gaffer.
The user's current movements

11:54.905 --> 11:56.785
place her in the Moss Heath area.

11:58.538 --> 12:00.138
- Good work.
- Sarge.

12:02.465 --> 12:06.245
Liz, James. Surveillance op. Let's go.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.745
Don't know how long I'll be.

12:59.545 --> 13:02.704
This is a surveillance image
captured on the Borogrove Estate

13:02.705 --> 13:06.264
that appears to show an OCG Nominal
I encountered in 2012

13:06.265 --> 13:09.664
during our inquiry into DCI Tony Gates.

13:09.665 --> 13:13.667
Recognition software gives
a 99.5% probability

13:13.668 --> 13:17.445
the image represents
Miroslav Minkowicz, as he is today.

13:17.737 --> 13:21.245
Minkowicz is a violent offender,
considered extremely dangerous.

13:21.785 --> 13:25.864
Surveillance of Lisa McQueen,
the female OCG nominal,

13:25.865 --> 13:29.264
has identified two locations
of interest to our inquiry.

13:29.265 --> 13:31.304
Pulton House on the Borogrove Estate,

13:31.305 --> 13:33.464
where McQueen spent over an hour,

13:33.465 --> 13:36.184
and Kingsgate Printing Services.

13:36.185 --> 13:38.625
So what do we know about
this block on the Grove?

13:40.465 --> 13:43.261
Six flats. All were
a cash purchase four months ago.

13:43.262 --> 13:44.744
Now, we're trying to trace the owners,

13:44.745 --> 13:47.325
but there's every chance
they're a front for the OCG.

13:48.145 --> 13:49.864
Surveillance images.

13:49.865 --> 13:51.725
Various visitors.

13:52.105 --> 13:54.184
Recognition software
indicates a number of them

13:54.185 --> 13:56.344
are on the sex offenders' register.

13:56.345 --> 13:59.984
Now, we were particularly interested
in the period McQueen was there.

13:59.985 --> 14:02.745
This image shows a figure
leaving via a back exit.

14:06.385 --> 14:07.784
Any recognition data?

14:07.785 --> 14:09.144
Unfortunately not, sir.

14:09.145 --> 14:11.904
We've blown it up, but we can't
visualise any features.

14:11.905 --> 14:14.384
But we're keeping the image
on file in case biometrics match

14:14.385 --> 14:16.664
- a suspect down the line.
- Good.

14:16.665 --> 14:19.544
There are only two reasons
an OCG would use this house,

14:19.545 --> 14:21.464
drugs and prostitution.

14:21.465 --> 14:24.424
All the visitors were male,
with the exception of McQueen.

14:24.425 --> 14:27.285
No females seen entering
or exiting the property?

14:28.065 --> 14:29.285
Correct.

14:30.145 --> 14:33.784
Sir, DI Fleming's right, but we
still haven't determined for certain

14:33.785 --> 14:36.224
the nature of what occurs
at these premises.

14:36.225 --> 14:38.304
McQueen's still carrying out contacts,

14:38.305 --> 14:40.184
possibly with corrupt police officers.

14:40.185 --> 14:42.984
If we go in, we risk missing out
on future leads.

14:42.985 --> 14:46.024
Same applies to raiding the
print shop to arrest the UCO.

14:46.025 --> 14:48.945
We might miss out on apprehending
every member of the OCG.

14:52.185 --> 14:53.544
Look, Steve,

14:53.545 --> 14:55.864
I know this Minkowicz guy
is the guy that tortured you,

14:55.865 --> 14:57.704
and we all want him behind bars,

14:57.705 --> 15:00.824
but Kate has raised a vulnerability
issue here we cannot ignore.

15:00.825 --> 15:03.544
There's a strong suggestion
women in that block are being

15:03.545 --> 15:06.824
kept in modern-day slavery
to provide sexual services.

15:06.825 --> 15:08.584
Our duty is to protect them.

15:08.585 --> 15:10.704
So we will carry out that duty,

15:10.705 --> 15:16.064
and we will raid the house,
and raid the print shop.

15:16.065 --> 15:17.405
Sir.

15:17.987 --> 15:21.585
Good. Now we're sucking diesel.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.744
This is the lorry.

15:25.745 --> 15:27.704
Payload, 3.5 tonne.

15:27.705 --> 15:30.485
We can't take everything.
We've got to be selective.

15:30.945 --> 15:33.145
What about the security guards?

15:34.425 --> 15:35.664
These are our guys.

15:35.665 --> 15:36.846
They've already organised their shifts

15:36.847 --> 15:38.565
so they'll be on when the lorries arrive.

15:42.585 --> 15:44.464
Bird's been on my case for days.

15:44.465 --> 15:47.144
Best just give her
what's she's gagging for, huh?

15:47.145 --> 15:48.744
That'd take all of us.

15:48.745 --> 15:50.745
Including her!

15:52.305 --> 15:54.424
Hi, love. What are you wearing?

15:54.425 --> 15:57.704
We're going to hit Pulton House
and Kingsgate Printing Services.

15:57.705 --> 16:00.245
You sound a bit overdressed to me.

16:01.145 --> 16:03.985
This was out of my hands, mate,
you've got to understand.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.704
Do you think you could sort
your sex life out another time?

16:07.705 --> 16:09.264
Yeah, all right, all right.

16:09.265 --> 16:10.944
All right. Look, I'm in work.

16:10.945 --> 16:12.824
I've got to go.

16:12.825 --> 16:14.464
I'll bell you later.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.124
All right, ta-ra.

16:23.905 --> 16:26.624
OK, so we're getting
an inventory of what's in there.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.784
Cash in there from
the Nottingham bank job,

16:28.785 --> 16:31.322
bullion from the A5 security van hold-up,

16:31.323 --> 16:33.424
and jewels off of the safe
deposit job in Wolverhampton.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.896
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

16:51.897 --> 16:54.505
Armed police! Do not move!

16:55.545 --> 16:57.144
Armed police! Don't move!

16:57.145 --> 16:58.704
- Don't move!
- Hands above your head!

16:58.705 --> 17:00.744
- Armed police!
- Armed police! Don't move!

17:00.745 --> 17:02.332
Hands on your head!
Hands on your head! Over here!

17:02.333 --> 17:03.719
Keep still!

17:03.744 --> 17:06.104
Put your hands behind your back!
Face the wall!

17:06.105 --> 17:09.925
On your knees! Now!
Keep your hands on your head!

17:13.065 --> 17:14.664
All clear.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.104
Face the wall!

17:20.305 --> 17:21.744
Hands behind your back!

17:23.185 --> 17:24.784
Shit.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.944
Cuff him. Get them out.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.745
You're OK, Miss, all right?
No-one's going to hurt you.

17:32.345 --> 17:34.985
Christ, these have all got locks
on the outside.

17:40.705 --> 17:43.664
Armed police. Whoever's in there,
please stand clear of the door.

17:43.665 --> 17:46.845
We've going to break in.
No-one's going to hurt you.

17:47.945 --> 17:49.325
Do it.

17:56.478 --> 17:58.278
Clear!

18:01.785 --> 18:04.165
Oh, Christ, how old is she?

18:08.705 --> 18:10.224
It's all right.

18:10.225 --> 18:12.025
You're safe now. It's OK.

18:13.545 --> 18:15.125
Take care of her.

18:15.705 --> 18:18.045
DS Arnott. Superintendent Hastings.

18:26.185 --> 18:27.585
Carry on.

18:43.545 --> 18:47.885
The OCG had vacated the premises,
only the workers left.

18:48.345 --> 18:49.965
How the hell did they know?

18:51.945 --> 18:54.045
Any other notable findings in the safe?

18:54.585 --> 18:56.505
No. Not yet, sir.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.099
What are you playing at?!

19:15.124 --> 19:16.664
- We had an agreement!
- I know.

19:16.665 --> 19:19.184
Hitting the print shop like that,
I couldn't let that happen.

19:19.185 --> 19:21.904
Have you any idea how many potential
leads have gone up the spout?

19:21.905 --> 19:23.424
The risks I take!

19:23.425 --> 19:25.664
John, I know you do.
But you're right to be pissed off.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.304
You know? You're anti-corruption,
but yet you go on like

19:28.305 --> 19:31.485
you haven't got the first clue
about the damage bent coppers cause.

19:32.665 --> 19:35.824
Look, I'm the last one to defend
what they do to the livestock.

19:35.825 --> 19:38.045
Right, and if them girls are free,
then good luck to them.

19:38.825 --> 19:40.784
Look, it all comes down to politics.

19:40.785 --> 19:43.384
No-one wants it coming out
that organised crime depends on

19:43.385 --> 19:46.224
bent coppers, and for all I know,
there could be a bent copper

19:46.225 --> 19:48.344
at the top of the tree
pulling all the strings.

19:48.345 --> 19:50.895
Powell lost her bottle.
Maybe you have, too.

19:50.896 --> 19:54.005
No. I'm in. Whatever it takes, I'm in.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.405
Who gave the order?

20:03.971 --> 20:05.491
Hastings?!

20:10.345 --> 20:13.045
Look, there's a reason we had
to pull out of the print shop.

20:13.531 --> 20:15.251
There's a big job Thursday night.

20:17.745 --> 20:20.024
What's the plan? Who's involved?

20:20.025 --> 20:23.145
After last time? You get the bare bones.

20:25.385 --> 20:26.984
There's a routine transport.

20:26.985 --> 20:30.664
We've paid the driver off,
and the security guards as well.

20:30.665 --> 20:33.864
But they're just small fry.
There's going to be a big fish.

20:33.865 --> 20:36.344
A senior police officer
who's been pulling strings to

20:36.345 --> 20:38.784
make sure that we don't have
half the force descending on us.

20:38.785 --> 20:41.565
Wait. What place are you on about?

20:45.625 --> 20:47.345
Eastfield Depot.

20:49.185 --> 20:50.824
You're kidding.

20:50.825 --> 20:51.805
No.

20:52.225 --> 20:53.584
I need more info than that.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.944
Look, you'll get the OCG.
But, most importantly, you'll get to

20:56.945 --> 20:59.265
nick a high-ranking
corrupt police officer.

21:00.305 --> 21:01.665
H?

21:03.425 --> 21:05.824
Just make sure you're in place
with the surveillance

21:05.825 --> 21:08.184
- and the firepower to take them on.
- Look, John!

21:08.185 --> 21:10.144
I need the name of the corrupt officer.

21:10.145 --> 21:12.025
Like I'd take the risk of telling you.

21:13.745 --> 21:16.224
There's people in high places
who don't want this coming out.

21:16.225 --> 21:17.505
Come on, mate.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.885
I need more.

21:49.065 --> 21:50.384
All right?

21:50.385 --> 21:51.905
All right.

21:53.585 --> 21:56.125
- How'd you know?
- Know what?

21:56.825 --> 21:58.585
To clear out the print shop.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.744
I didn't.

22:01.745 --> 22:03.584
It's common sense.

22:03.585 --> 22:05.705
When you're planning a big job,
you keep moving on.

22:07.398 --> 22:11.325
I wish I HAD known. Then I could've
warned about the brothel, as well.

22:12.745 --> 22:14.405
Just lucky, then?

22:15.185 --> 22:19.024
Yeah. Yeah, that's me, Lise.

22:19.278 --> 22:21.038
I've always been a lucky lad.

22:43.665 --> 22:46.504
Gill. I wasn't expecting you.

22:46.505 --> 22:49.224
I had a meeting
with the PCC this morning.

22:49.225 --> 22:50.485
Oh?

22:50.945 --> 22:52.344
What can I say?

22:52.345 --> 22:54.504
We're throwing
a lot of resources at the problem,

22:54.505 --> 22:56.664
but Corbett's still at large.

22:56.665 --> 22:59.664
The PCC's anxious for a breakthrough.

22:59.665 --> 23:01.304
You know, don't worry, we're close.

23:01.305 --> 23:02.401
We're going to get our man.

23:02.402 --> 23:05.077
I also had to talk Rohan down
after we found out

23:05.102 --> 23:07.424
that Deputy Chief Constable Wise
had agreed to suppress the

23:07.425 --> 23:09.585
red notice against Maneet Bindra.

23:10.905 --> 23:14.105
DCC Wise accepted the evidence

23:14.130 --> 23:16.424
that Maneet Bindra was acting undercover.

23:16.425 --> 23:18.905
Andrea was only appointed
because she's a woman.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.024
The DCC oversees anti-corruption.

23:23.025 --> 23:26.384
Being female, she can't be a Mason.

23:26.385 --> 23:29.984
Speaking of which, I understand
that you have finally promoted

23:29.985 --> 23:33.144
a female inspector, DI Fleming?

23:33.145 --> 23:34.424
Kate.

23:34.425 --> 23:36.744
Yeah, yeah, great wee girl,
doing a bang-up job.

23:36.745 --> 23:40.525
Mind you, that is exactly what a
sexist would do to cover his tracks.

23:41.425 --> 23:42.944
What?

23:42.945 --> 23:44.845
I'm just pulling your leg!

23:46.625 --> 23:48.104
Find Corbett, Ted,

23:48.105 --> 23:52.205
and then all this other bullshit
will vanish like the bullshit it is.

24:15.385 --> 24:17.664
Mariana, can you tell me
about anyone who came

24:17.665 --> 24:18.944
to the house yesterday?

24:18.945 --> 24:21.344
We're particularly
interested in a woman who visited.

24:38.865 --> 24:41.224
Normally, they only bring
men into the house,

24:41.225 --> 24:44.165
but there was a woman,
and she spoke with one of the men.

24:45.905 --> 24:48.205
Can you tell us more about this man?

24:48.865 --> 24:51.464
Boss, might have got something
out of the brothel.

24:51.465 --> 24:52.885
Great.

24:53.465 --> 24:55.424
Through the interpreter,
one of the girls said

24:55.425 --> 24:58.104
she glimpsed a woman matching
Lisa McQueen's description,

24:58.105 --> 24:59.843
around the time we know McQueen
was in there.

24:59.844 --> 25:03.384
She, McQueen, was seen taking
one of the Johns into a bedroom.

25:03.385 --> 25:05.424
She wasn't providing sexual services?

25:05.425 --> 25:07.744
The girl said the John
appeared surprised by McQueen,

25:07.745 --> 25:10.504
maybe even intimidated,
but about what, she doesn't know.

25:10.505 --> 25:11.824
Description?

25:11.825 --> 25:16.384
Middle-aged, average height, or just
above, heavy-ish build, light hair.

25:16.385 --> 25:18.025
She believes this could be him.

25:21.105 --> 25:23.104
Any distinguishing features?

25:23.105 --> 25:26.064
The girl doesn't know enough English
to identify a specific region,

25:26.065 --> 25:29.944
but she thinks he had a
strong accent, definitely not local.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.165
- OK.
- Kate...

25:34.185 --> 25:35.745
...we need to talk.

25:49.391 --> 25:50.831
What's up, mate?

25:52.025 --> 25:54.725
The CHIS who's been giving me
intel on the OCG...

25:55.745 --> 25:57.205
...it's Corbett.

25:58.025 --> 26:00.224
Look, I should have told you earlier.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.545
No, really?

26:01.570 --> 26:03.144
I didn't know how it
was going to play out.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.504
I was protecting you.

26:04.505 --> 26:07.264
What? Because I'm a DI?
That's bullshit, Steve.

26:07.265 --> 26:09.584
You'd have never have held out on me
when we were both DSs.

26:09.585 --> 26:11.504
- It's the truth.
- Christ's sake, Steve!

26:11.505 --> 26:13.944
Corbett's insisted we met
on the DL because he's convinced

26:13.945 --> 26:17.144
there's a high-level conspiracy
to suppress his investigation.

26:17.145 --> 26:19.384
Who? Who at high level?

26:19.385 --> 26:22.624
He reckoned DSU Powell sabotaged
his efforts to gather intelligence

26:22.625 --> 26:25.665
on senior police officers
colluding with organised crime.

26:27.505 --> 26:30.864
He also expressed suspicions about
the Gaffer.

26:30.865 --> 26:32.064
Right.

26:32.065 --> 26:33.864
What's he got to back it up?

26:33.865 --> 26:35.704
The raids on the print shop
and the brothel.

26:35.705 --> 26:38.464
There is no way, in this day and
age, the Gaffer would have ignored

26:38.465 --> 26:41.025
the vulnerability of the women
in that brothel.

26:44.905 --> 26:46.425
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:51.185 --> 26:53.665
This is the reason
I had to tell you about Corbett.

27:05.705 --> 27:07.345
Oh, Jesus.

27:09.665 --> 27:11.185
Let's go.

27:19.425 --> 27:20.825
Yep?

27:28.105 --> 27:29.984
What's going on?
You look like a couple of kids

27:29.985 --> 27:31.985
who've been caught robbing an orchard.

27:34.145 --> 27:36.904
Sir, I've made contact
with DS John Corbett.

27:37.152 --> 27:38.952
Dear God. How?

27:40.025 --> 27:42.365
Corbett reached out
to Steve directly, sir.

27:43.025 --> 27:45.704
Well, that's the ticket. Do you
think we can lure him to a meeting?

27:45.705 --> 27:47.744
Steve's already had one, sir.

27:47.745 --> 27:49.005
You have?

27:49.425 --> 27:50.664
Four.

27:50.665 --> 27:52.125
And who was with you?

27:52.385 --> 27:54.144
No-one.

27:54.145 --> 27:57.064
Oh, for Christ's sake, son, you've
just broken every rule in the book!

27:57.065 --> 27:58.704
Sir, it's not what you might think.

27:58.705 --> 28:00.104
A couple of times, he ambushed me.

28:00.105 --> 28:01.778
The others wouldn't have happened
if I wasn't on my own.

28:01.803 --> 28:03.531
Yeah, for good reason!
For your own safety,

28:03.532 --> 28:06.944
- and for proper authorisation!
- I thought it best not to jeopardise

28:06.945 --> 28:09.196
the contact, to try and develop
a supply line of intelligence.

28:09.197 --> 28:10.922
- Did you know about this?
- Yes, I did.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.904
Sir, I didn't tell Kate at first.

28:12.905 --> 28:15.429
Soon as I did, she took
the decision to include you.

28:15.430 --> 28:17.584
I should report you, DS Arnott,

28:17.585 --> 28:20.085
if it wouldn't cause a bigger stink
than we have already!

28:20.665 --> 28:22.704
Did you think of reporting
to your seniors?

28:22.705 --> 28:24.672
What about arresting John Corbett,
did that occur to you?

28:24.673 --> 28:26.874
Corbett claims he was forced to
commit offences to maintain

28:26.899 --> 28:30.104
- his cover.
- Sir, Steve's built a rapport.

28:30.105 --> 28:32.184
Corbett's the CHIS he's been using.

28:32.185 --> 28:34.704
He's enabled us to detect
Jane Cafferty's corruption,

28:34.705 --> 28:38.904
apprehend Lee Banks, identify
Miroslav Minkowicz and Lisa McQueen,

28:38.905 --> 28:42.224
and break up an important element
of their sex trafficking operation.

28:42.225 --> 28:44.104
It does appear Corbett's still
carrying out

28:44.105 --> 28:46.491
- an undercover operation.
- "Appear."

28:46.492 --> 28:49.544
And now he's relayed intelligence
on a planned armed robbery of the

28:49.545 --> 28:52.104
- Eastfield Depot.
- Eastfield?

28:52.105 --> 28:54.824
What's he got backing him up there,
a Panzer division?

28:54.825 --> 28:57.424
Communication with the higher
levels of the OCG have been

28:57.425 --> 28:58.904
carried out via a computer link.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.224
Corbett's disclosed the
robbery's been planned

29:01.225 --> 29:03.485
with the collusion of a corrupt
senior police officer.

29:04.425 --> 29:06.064
Any details on this officer?

29:06.065 --> 29:08.605
No, sir,
I've not been provided with an ID.

29:11.265 --> 29:14.464
Sir, this is a chance to crack
the highest-level link

29:14.465 --> 29:17.384
between corrupt officers
and organised crime,

29:17.385 --> 29:18.945
possibly even the top man.

29:25.345 --> 29:28.144
Look, if we are contemplating
collaborating with John Corbett,

29:28.145 --> 29:33.565
and that's a big if, we cannot
allow this to blow up in our faces.

29:36.345 --> 29:39.685
He will go to jail, come what may,
I can promise you that.

29:41.745 --> 29:43.925
I'm going to have to run this
past the DCC.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.585
But, look...

29:49.065 --> 29:50.745
...you're my best team.

29:51.985 --> 29:54.125
If this is how you want to call it...

29:54.505 --> 29:56.864
...I will back you to the hilt.

29:56.865 --> 29:58.765
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.018
Off you go.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.784
One thing.

30:08.785 --> 30:10.064
Yeah?

30:10.065 --> 30:13.904
The raid on the print shop,
any reason they knew to clear out?

30:14.184 --> 30:15.504
No.

30:16.345 --> 30:17.785
Christ's sake, Steve.

30:53.625 --> 30:56.405
_

31:08.945 --> 31:12.105
Alpha Charlie Eight Two, sit rep, no obs.

31:17.785 --> 31:21.265
Alpha Charlie Nine Six, sit rep, no obs.

31:45.785 --> 31:48.464
Eastfield from
Transport, ETA five minutes.

31:48.465 --> 31:50.485
- Copy that.
- John!

31:54.585 --> 31:57.184
Where's your man? I thought
you said promises had been made!

31:57.185 --> 31:58.344
They have.

31:58.345 --> 32:00.984
I want that bent bastard here with
us, taking the same risk we are.

32:00.985 --> 32:02.800
How do we know he's not going
to set us up?

32:02.801 --> 32:04.647
- You want to call it off?
- No way.

32:04.648 --> 32:06.925
How's it going to look
when we say we bottled it?

32:07.585 --> 32:10.624
Right. Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Let's get these cars going.

32:10.625 --> 32:13.064
Come on, let's move!

32:13.065 --> 32:14.585
Come on!

32:40.945 --> 32:42.705
That's the planned transport.

32:47.545 --> 32:50.504
Alpha Charlie Nine Six, obs on LGV.

32:50.505 --> 32:53.405
Bravo Echo Six Five India.

32:56.665 --> 32:58.984
One of these security guards
looks at us the wrong way,

32:58.985 --> 33:01.344
no beating around the bush,
we're straight out of here.

33:01.345 --> 33:02.585
Yeah? Got it.

33:04.105 --> 33:06.913
Alpha Charlie Eight Two, obs on 3 SUVs

33:06.914 --> 33:08.485
entering main gate.

33:12.065 --> 33:13.304
Right, game on.

33:13.305 --> 33:15.264
Corbett was right.

33:15.265 --> 33:17.104
Security's definitely in on it.

33:17.105 --> 33:20.304
Sharon, snap those security guards.

33:20.305 --> 33:23.144
Three Seven Eight
Two, snap those security guards.

33:23.145 --> 33:25.085
- Eight Two received.
- SHUTTER CLICKS

33:40.265 --> 33:41.824
Right, weapons.

33:41.825 --> 33:44.264
I've got four M4s...

33:44.265 --> 33:46.079
Right, everyone stay calm,

33:46.080 --> 33:48.744
and no-one gets hurt, it's just for show.

33:48.745 --> 33:52.584
- Hands above your heads!
- Don't even think about it, dickhead!

33:52.585 --> 33:54.745
Move. Hands behind your back.

34:02.785 --> 34:04.845
They're going for the CCTV.

34:05.545 --> 34:08.063
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

34:08.065 --> 34:11.224
Back it up! Keep coming.

34:11.225 --> 34:12.425
Come on.

34:28.225 --> 34:29.945
Sharon, get as much as you can.

34:31.536 --> 34:33.224
Get the cars turned round.

34:34.585 --> 34:36.264
Keep going. Come on!

34:38.625 --> 34:41.465
We can't tell if there's
a corrupt officer in among them.

34:50.425 --> 34:52.143
Good lad. Good lad. Well done.

34:52.145 --> 34:54.304
Come on! Everybody, keep moving!

34:54.304 --> 34:55.784
Keep moving!

35:12.225 --> 35:13.744
We got a signal?

35:13.745 --> 35:15.184
Yeah.

35:15.185 --> 35:17.025
All trackers active.

35:25.745 --> 35:27.344
The bent copper's a no-show.

35:27.345 --> 35:29.665
We've got a good haul.
I say we get the hell out.

35:32.705 --> 35:34.344
John, let's not push our luck.

35:34.345 --> 35:35.945
No, let's keep going.

35:37.625 --> 35:41.185
Keep loading! Keep loading!

35:42.865 --> 35:45.144
Alpha Charlie Three Seven, sit rep.

35:45.145 --> 35:47.264
Alpha Charlie One Zero, receiving.

35:47.265 --> 35:50.184
Sir, OCG have entered the depot.
Currently all going as planned.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.645
Received. Standing by.

35:55.345 --> 35:56.745
Ah, shit!

36:02.145 --> 36:03.825
The bent bastard's crossed us!

36:05.945 --> 36:07.424
What the hell's going on?

36:07.425 --> 36:09.224
Turn your radios up.

36:09.225 --> 36:12.464
Who's got the pool radio? Come on!

36:12.465 --> 36:18.784
Charlie Yankee Three
Five, status zero, Farmers Lane.

36:18.785 --> 36:21.704
Status zero, Farmers Lane.

36:21.705 --> 36:24.184
Farmers Lane,
that's only a few minutes from here.

36:24.185 --> 36:27.984
Local units state five, stand by.

36:27.985 --> 36:30.944
Charlie Yankee Three Five,
request sit rep.

36:30.945 --> 36:34.424
Control, Three Five, suspect...

36:34.425 --> 36:36.264
We've been targeted for ambush.

36:36.265 --> 36:37.784
Status zero!

36:37.785 --> 36:40.904
Alpha Charlie One Zero,
I'm picking up a Status Zero call.

36:40.905 --> 36:43.024
You've got a whole firearms unit there.

36:43.025 --> 36:45.464
Sir, this could be
a deliberate diversion.

36:45.465 --> 36:48.304
That's as may be, Kate,
but regs are regs.

36:48.305 --> 36:50.784
First duty, preservation of life.

36:50.785 --> 36:53.925
Divert the AFOs to respond
to the Status Zero.

36:54.945 --> 36:56.464
Three Seven, received.

36:56.465 --> 36:59.072
All units, status zero, Farmers Lane...

36:59.073 --> 37:01.824
H hasn't showed. We've got
trackers on the goods.

37:01.825 --> 37:04.705
Lima Oscar Three Six,
state five to Farmers Lane.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.144
Shit.

37:09.145 --> 37:12.104
- You go. Be as quick as you can.
- Ma'am. Kyle, let's go.

37:12.105 --> 37:13.905
Deploy with me.

37:20.905 --> 37:24.384
Sierra Zulu Five Two.
State five to Farmers Lane.

37:24.385 --> 37:26.344
Every copper and his dog's on his way!

37:26.345 --> 37:28.504
- We've got to clear out.
- We can't stay here.

37:28.505 --> 37:30.745
Now, come on. Keep loading! Keep going!

37:32.585 --> 37:34.824
Go, move!

37:34.825 --> 37:38.104
Get moving! Move! Faster!

37:38.105 --> 37:41.624
Come on, lads. Let's go! Let's go!

37:41.625 --> 37:43.345
Move, move, move, move!

37:44.665 --> 37:46.265
Faster!

37:48.785 --> 37:50.344
DS Arnott, AC-12.

37:50.345 --> 37:52.384
We've got firearms cover.

37:52.385 --> 37:53.784
Secure the officers.

37:53.785 --> 37:55.744
Fan out! Secure the area.

37:55.745 --> 37:59.144
Control. Alpha Charlie Four Five.
Status six, Farmers Lane.

37:59.145 --> 38:00.944
Stand by for sit rep.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.325
Received, Four Five. Standing by.

38:05.425 --> 38:06.704
What happened?

38:06.705 --> 38:08.144
We skidded off the road, Sarge.

38:08.145 --> 38:10.424
- They must've put oil down or something.
- "They"?

38:10.425 --> 38:12.508
We saw the OCG in the trees.

38:12.509 --> 38:14.024
Guns and balaclavas.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.645
Move. Everyone, take cover!

38:19.385 --> 38:21.144
Alpha Charlie Four Five.

38:21.145 --> 38:24.104
Armed OCG reported, Farmers Lane.

38:24.105 --> 38:25.464
Received, Four Five.

38:25.465 --> 38:26.945
- All right?

38:30.145 --> 38:31.664
Alpha Charlie Eight Two,

38:31.665 --> 38:34.024
obs on vehicle approaching gatehouse.

38:34.025 --> 38:35.464
Take a reg.

38:35.465 --> 38:37.485
This could be him.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.705
Hey, John.

38:43.065 --> 38:45.645
Bravo Tango One Seven.

38:55.705 --> 38:57.224
Hold your fire!

38:57.545 --> 38:59.185
Here he is.

39:00.665 --> 39:03.085
It's a friendly. It's a job car.

39:11.585 --> 39:13.104
Shit!

39:26.265 --> 39:27.904
You took your time!

39:27.905 --> 39:30.344
Alpha Charlie
Nine Six, obs on male subject

39:30.345 --> 39:32.885
wearing dark clothing and balaclava.

39:37.225 --> 39:39.065
What the hell is he doing?

39:43.025 --> 39:47.344
Alpha Charlie Nine Six,
male subject engaged with OCG,

39:47.345 --> 39:49.344
appears to have passed them something,

39:49.345 --> 39:51.365
could be an electronic device.

39:57.105 --> 39:59.705
Christ's sake, he's telling them
about our trackers!

40:02.985 --> 40:06.264
Three Seven to Four Five,
state 12 on three.

40:06.265 --> 40:09.544
Four Five, receiving, state 12.

40:09.545 --> 40:12.824
We have obs on high-ranking nominal
having joined the OCG operation.

40:12.825 --> 40:15.845
I need the AFOs, state six ASAP.

40:15.846 --> 40:19.165
Ma'am, we're in a lockdown here.
Possible firearms threat.

40:19.985 --> 40:23.624
I'm sorry, mate, I'm pulling rank.
I'm making the decision as TFC.

40:23.625 --> 40:26.864
Deploy me one vehicle
and three AFOs, ASAP.

40:26.865 --> 40:28.104
Received.

40:28.105 --> 40:31.544
We're moving out.
One vehicle, three AFOs with me!

40:31.545 --> 40:33.264
- Kyle, stay here with them.
- Got it.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.664
- You can't leave us here, Sarge.
- Sorry, mate.

40:35.665 --> 40:39.904
Paul, Andy, deploy with DS Arnott.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.944
Right, that's all the trackers.

40:42.945 --> 40:44.184
Let's go!

40:44.185 --> 40:46.544
What if this bent bastard
still does the dirty on us?

40:46.545 --> 40:48.105
Come on, Steve.

40:49.825 --> 40:51.505
Come on.

41:00.505 --> 41:02.241
What you waiting for?!

41:02.277 --> 41:03.757
John?

41:10.265 --> 41:13.224
RAPID GUNFIRE, SCREAMS

41:13.225 --> 41:14.784
Shit!

41:14.785 --> 41:16.384
Bloody hell, John!

41:16.385 --> 41:18.864
He crossed us! Come on! Let's go!

41:20.305 --> 41:24.744
Control, Alpha Charlie Three Seven,
Status Zero at Eastfield Depot.

41:24.745 --> 41:29.064
Urgent ambulance required,
serious casualty, gunshot wounds.

41:29.065 --> 41:31.305
- Received, Three Seven.
- Shit.

41:36.672 --> 41:38.151
Shit!

41:38.345 --> 41:40.544
There's a disused service road
down the back.

41:40.545 --> 41:42.824
Three Seven Four Five, status six.

41:42.825 --> 41:44.944
Nominal's down. We're moving in.

41:47.865 --> 41:50.565
One Zero Three Seven, active message.

41:53.145 --> 41:56.144
Alpha Charlie One Zero, do you copy?

41:56.145 --> 41:58.584
Sir, do you copy?

41:58.585 --> 42:00.224
Follow us. Keep following us.

42:00.225 --> 42:04.504
I told you that bent bastard
grassed us up to cover his own arse!

42:04.505 --> 42:06.785
I know a rat when I see one!

42:08.905 --> 42:09.945
Keep on him!

42:11.105 --> 42:12.345
Keep on him!

42:29.065 --> 42:32.144
One Zero, are you receiving?

42:32.145 --> 42:34.145
Oh, Christ!

42:46.665 --> 42:47.985
Shit!

42:59.785 --> 43:01.704
Shit!

43:01.705 --> 43:03.544
One Zero, what's your sit rep?

43:03.545 --> 43:05.664
Hold on, there's an ambulance coming.

43:05.665 --> 43:08.424
DCS Hargreaves, sir. Can you hear me?

43:08.425 --> 43:10.152
Kate, what's going on?

43:10.153 --> 43:13.685
One Zero, Three Seven, one
in custody, severe gunshot wounds.

43:14.725 --> 43:16.624
He's bleeding out.

43:16.625 --> 43:18.864
- Keep going straight!
- OK.

43:18.865 --> 43:20.624
Go on! Go on!

43:20.625 --> 43:22.265
Go on!

43:35.465 --> 43:36.905
Shit!

43:51.185 --> 43:54.264
Gunshot wounds to the lower limbs,
severe haemorrhaging.

43:54.265 --> 43:56.504
Tourniquets are only
giving partial control,

43:56.505 --> 43:58.504
looks like major arterial bleeds.

43:58.505 --> 44:01.384
Patient has weak pulse with tachycardia,

44:01.385 --> 44:04.625
needs 100% oxygen and rapid IVI.

44:11.865 --> 44:12.989
Sir.

44:12.990 --> 44:14.268
Right. Sir.

44:14.269 --> 44:16.984
This is a right mess. What did they get?

44:16.985 --> 44:19.104
We're estimating
they got away with seized goods

44:19.105 --> 44:21.464
worth in the region of 50 million quid.

44:21.465 --> 44:23.584
That's before you throw in
the evidential losses

44:23.585 --> 44:25.704
- to ongoing inquiries.
- Mother of God.

44:25.705 --> 44:29.024
We had trackers concealed in
every single consignment of value.

44:29.025 --> 44:30.704
Hargreaves tipped them off.

44:30.705 --> 44:32.664
They detected and disposed of them all.

44:32.665 --> 44:34.285
We don't know how he knew.

44:35.025 --> 44:38.224
Right. Who's in charge here?

44:38.225 --> 44:41.184
Serious Crime. DCI Patel over there
with DS Railston.

44:41.185 --> 44:42.545
All right.

44:47.225 --> 44:49.984
We've got AFOs out searching,
but as yet, there's no sign of them.

44:49.985 --> 44:51.445
Thanks.

44:52.225 --> 44:54.984
Everyone's talking about
DCS Hargreaves going missing.

44:54.985 --> 44:57.345
- What's the story?
- Kate!

45:01.905 --> 45:03.264
Steve?

45:03.265 --> 45:05.105
You know I can't say a word, Sam.

45:07.385 --> 45:09.544
Look, it's probably not the place, but...

45:09.545 --> 45:13.625
Yeah, I'm sorry. I meant to call.

45:14.865 --> 45:16.657
Well, if you were investigating
Hargreaves,

45:16.658 --> 45:18.845
I'm guessing that's why you didn't
want to complicate things.

45:20.145 --> 45:21.345
Yeah.

45:23.398 --> 45:25.118
Sorry, Steve.

45:25.865 --> 45:27.104
I'm telling you, this Corbett fella's

45:27.105 --> 45:29.000
playing us for a bunch of mugs.

45:29.001 --> 45:31.505
But that's OK, cos we can play
that game as well.

45:41.025 --> 45:43.664
PC Bloom, in the early hours
of this morning, March 7th,

45:43.665 --> 45:45.424
your police patrol vehicle left the road

45:45.425 --> 45:47.584
and crashed into a ditch
alongside Farmers Lane.

45:47.585 --> 45:49.064
Correct, Sarge.

45:49.065 --> 45:50.624
In a remark made to me at the scene,

45:50.625 --> 45:52.503
you suggested oil had
been put on the road.

45:52.528 --> 45:53.624
That's right.

45:53.625 --> 45:56.544
You also claimed to have observed
suspects wearing balaclavas,

45:56.545 --> 45:58.144
equipped with firearms,

45:58.145 --> 46:00.375
as a result of which, you
made a Status Zero call.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.467
Yes.

46:03.505 --> 46:05.904
Search of the area found no suspects.

46:05.905 --> 46:08.656
They must have fled
when the cavalry arrived.

46:08.657 --> 46:10.344
OK, makes sense.

46:10.345 --> 46:12.025
And we DID find oil on the road.

46:13.345 --> 46:16.525
Document 14 in your folder,
forensic chemical report.

46:20.145 --> 46:23.384
Great. So everything checks out, then.

46:23.385 --> 46:25.984
Please refer to
Document 15 in your folder.

46:25.985 --> 46:27.944
This is a forensic report
on chemical samples

46:27.945 --> 46:30.184
taken from PC Bloom's hands.

46:30.185 --> 46:32.464
You'll see from Document 15
that minute traces of oil

46:32.465 --> 46:34.664
were detected on PC Bloom's hands.

46:34.665 --> 46:36.344
Document 16.

46:36.345 --> 46:38.704
Chemical comparison of the oil
detected on the road,

46:38.705 --> 46:41.304
and the oil detected on PC Bloom.

46:41.305 --> 46:44.144
Spectrographic analysis gives
a 99.5% probability

46:44.145 --> 46:47.184
that the oil detected on the road
and the oil detected

46:47.185 --> 46:50.245
on PC Bloom's hands came from
the same original source.

46:52.225 --> 46:53.424
You crashed the patrol car,

46:53.425 --> 46:56.265
and then put oil on the road
to make it look like an ambush.

46:57.305 --> 47:00.510
PC Bloom, I've been in consultation
with the Crown Prosecutor

47:00.511 --> 47:03.365
regarding a charge of
conspiracy to commit armed robbery.

47:04.305 --> 47:07.225
Your best option right now
is to tell us who put you up to it.

47:24.505 --> 47:26.025
DCS Hargreaves.

47:27.185 --> 47:29.825
What was the purpose of
the fake Status Zero call?

47:32.905 --> 47:36.485
Hargreaves said that he had to
be in the area at a certain time.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.305
The Status Zero call gave him an excuse.

47:43.025 --> 47:45.704
Mariana, our forensic
investigators carried out

47:45.705 --> 47:47.984
a search of the house
you were being kept in,

47:47.985 --> 47:50.825
and they detected a small freezer
in the back.

47:52.305 --> 47:54.965
Inside the freezer,
they found used condoms.

47:56.105 --> 47:57.745
Can you tell me why that might be?

48:20.625 --> 48:23.184
"Some of the men they made me
have sex with,

48:23.185 --> 48:25.305
"they told us,
'Always keep the condoms'."

48:29.825 --> 48:31.944
Did this order apply
to the man you told me

48:31.945 --> 48:35.465
you saw with Lisa McQueen
on the 4th of March?

48:42.917 --> 48:44.317
"Yes."

48:45.265 --> 48:46.504
DS Arnott, AC-12.

48:46.505 --> 48:48.864
I need a custody cell for
a police constable at a station

48:48.865 --> 48:50.224
he isn't known at.

48:50.225 --> 48:51.665
Decker Avenue.

48:53.465 --> 48:55.105
Great. Thanks.

48:57.545 --> 48:59.624
You call me back
when you've got confirmation?

48:59.625 --> 49:00.985
Yeah, thanks.

49:04.345 --> 49:06.544
I heard. Nice one.

49:06.545 --> 49:09.304
Any explanation on where the leak
came from about the trackers?

49:09.305 --> 49:10.605
No.

49:11.145 --> 49:13.824
Looks like Hargreaves
made an educated guess.

49:13.825 --> 49:15.304
How's yours gone?

49:15.305 --> 49:17.944
Well, the trafficked girl alleges
they were under orders to

49:17.945 --> 49:22.104
harvest DNA with certain clients,
used condoms kept in cold storage.

49:22.105 --> 49:24.024
Same blackmail MO they've used before,

49:24.025 --> 49:26.624
capturing DNA to plant at a crime scene.

49:26.625 --> 49:29.224
Possibly Hargreaves WAS being
blackmailed into conspiring

49:29.225 --> 49:31.104
in the robbery,
and he was forced to be there

49:31.105 --> 49:33.464
as security against
double crossing the OCG.

49:33.465 --> 49:35.184
Hence the Status Zero call.

49:35.185 --> 49:37.544
A cover story in case he was
spotted, and had to explain

49:37.545 --> 49:39.664
what he was doing in the vicinity
of the robbery.

49:39.665 --> 49:41.744
The only problem with the
Status Zero call

49:41.745 --> 49:43.345
meant we couldn't apprehend the OCG.

49:44.865 --> 49:46.984
The Gaffer had no choice.

49:47.325 --> 49:48.984
Preservation of life.

49:48.985 --> 49:50.625
Yeah, he had no choice.

49:54.065 --> 49:55.944
Sir, we've reached
threshold on Hargreaves.

49:55.945 --> 49:59.005
We need the trafficked girl to
ID him as soon as he's well enough.

49:59.945 --> 50:01.445
Sir?

50:01.705 --> 50:03.744
The hospital just called.

50:03.745 --> 50:06.944
Detective Chief Superintendent
Hargreaves was pronounced dead

50:06.945 --> 50:08.465
a short while ago.

50:42.618 --> 50:43.937
Hi, Gill.

50:43.962 --> 50:45.641
I was worried I was being stood up.

50:45.705 --> 50:47.944
Yeah. No, I'm sorry about that.

50:47.945 --> 50:49.424
Sorry.

50:49.425 --> 50:51.304
I found a way to pass the time.

50:51.305 --> 50:52.665
Join me?

50:53.945 --> 50:56.144
Yeah. Oh, thanks.

50:56.145 --> 50:58.144
Can I have a whiskey, please?
One piece of ice.

50:58.145 --> 50:59.665
Yes, of course, sir.

51:00.825 --> 51:02.145
Yeah.

51:04.825 --> 51:10.897
How would you characterise
AC-12's endeavours to apprehend

51:10.898 --> 51:14.645
a dangerously unpredictable UCO?

51:17.705 --> 51:20.285
I would say that we've been unlucky.

51:21.425 --> 51:22.865
Yeah.

51:24.985 --> 51:27.224
And we're failing.

51:27.225 --> 51:28.945
Well, not everyone agrees.

51:30.665 --> 51:33.765
- No?
- Some say it's just you that's failing.

51:35.585 --> 51:37.624
I'm not one of them, obviously.

51:37.625 --> 51:38.985
Right.

51:40.705 --> 51:43.285
Ted, I'm on your side.

51:45.145 --> 51:47.325
I don't want this to end badly for you.

51:47.705 --> 51:50.064
I don't want the fiasco of
Operation Pear Tree,

51:50.065 --> 51:52.184
which was not of your making,

51:52.185 --> 51:56.405
to add a disastrous coda to an
otherwise distinguished career.

52:01.985 --> 52:03.585
What are you saying?

52:05.465 --> 52:10.905
You've always put your team, your
department, your principles first.

52:13.065 --> 52:15.925
Maybe the time's come
to look after number one.

52:17.465 --> 52:19.704
How come I've got the sneaking
suspicion that we're

52:19.705 --> 52:21.555
talking about early retirement here?

52:21.556 --> 52:25.045
You're flattering yourself
using the adjective "early"!

52:29.124 --> 52:30.644
Thank you.

52:31.765 --> 52:33.885
I'm glad you said yes to this.

52:34.425 --> 52:38.485
But also a teeny bit surprised.

52:40.185 --> 52:41.565
Yeah, well...

52:42.265 --> 52:44.625
It's like you said,
we're both on the same side.

52:45.985 --> 52:48.264
I meant your...

52:48.265 --> 52:50.365
...personal situation.

52:54.225 --> 52:59.344
Yeah, well, that's personal, isn't it?

52:59.345 --> 53:00.945
So nothing's changed?

53:02.504 --> 53:04.064
Honestly?

53:08.564 --> 53:11.404
Hence you said yes to tonight.

53:18.505 --> 53:20.184
Yeah, well, it's only dinner.

53:20.185 --> 53:21.705
Yeah.

53:23.065 --> 53:24.425
It's only dinner.

53:32.865 --> 53:35.624
You screwed me over! I trusted you.

53:35.625 --> 53:37.744
You were meant to be there
to nick the bent bastard!

53:37.745 --> 53:39.425
Is that why you murdered him?!

53:40.705 --> 53:41.750
He's dead?

53:41.751 --> 53:44.725
What do you expect when you unload
an automatic rifle at someone?!

53:45.665 --> 53:48.504
No, I aimed low, to wound,

53:48.505 --> 53:52.024
so he wouldn't get away,
so you'd have him for questioning.

53:52.025 --> 53:53.824
Where were you when I needed you?

53:53.825 --> 53:56.664
The Status Zero gave us no choice.
First duty, preserve life.

53:56.665 --> 54:00.784
What kind of mug wouldn't realise
that that was a diversion, eh?

54:00.785 --> 54:02.405
Hastings?

54:03.485 --> 54:05.144
Look, Steve, don't you get it?

54:05.145 --> 54:07.824
He pulled you out of there
so we could get away with the gear.

54:07.825 --> 54:09.824
He's the one calling all the shots.
He's H!

54:09.825 --> 54:12.205
Look, I've had it with your bullshit!

54:12.945 --> 54:14.895
John Corbett, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Lester Har...

54:26.305 --> 54:28.805
I didn't mean to kill Hargreaves.

54:29.785 --> 54:33.027
But now I have, I've crossed the line.

54:33.028 --> 54:35.864
John, you crossed the line
a long while back.

54:35.865 --> 54:37.965
Police! Get back!

54:43.625 --> 54:45.565
No, that was always to keep my cover,

54:46.465 --> 54:49.464
and it was always someone else
who pulled the trigger.

54:49.465 --> 54:51.065
It wasn't me.

54:52.265 --> 54:53.825
It was their choice.

54:55.185 --> 54:57.245
But this time, it WAS me.

54:57.905 --> 54:59.465
It was MY choice.

55:03.705 --> 55:05.385
I'm on my own...

55:08.451 --> 55:10.171
...and there's no way back.

55:12.625 --> 55:15.265
I couldn't give myself up
even if I wanted to.

55:21.745 --> 55:24.224
No, I'll get this job done my way.

55:24.225 --> 55:25.785
My rules.

55:28.385 --> 55:31.125
We had a deal, and you sold me out.

55:31.625 --> 55:33.065
I trusted you.

55:36.745 --> 55:38.345
This is on you.

55:40.505 --> 55:41.945
It's all on you.

55:45.345 --> 55:46.445
What is?

55:47.258 --> 55:48.938
John, wait.

55:51.564 --> 55:54.725
What is? John!

56:03.985 --> 56:06.904
So it's only...
It's only temporary, obviously.

56:06.905 --> 56:08.765
Temporary, you know.

56:13.305 --> 56:15.145
I'm just going to use your bathroom.

56:26.225 --> 56:28.944
- Hello?
- Mrs Hastings?

56:28.945 --> 56:30.344
Yeah?

56:30.345 --> 56:32.984
I'm sorry to bother you at
such a late hour, Mrs Hastings.

56:32.985 --> 56:37.165
I'm Detective Sergeant
Steve Arnott, AC-12.

56:38.145 --> 56:40.045
Have we... Have we met before?

56:41.945 --> 56:43.384
I think once.

56:43.385 --> 56:45.624
It was a fair while ago. Sorry...

56:45.625 --> 56:47.384
How can I help you, Sergeant?

56:47.385 --> 56:49.664
It's a... It's a sensitive matter.

56:49.665 --> 56:51.904
Would it be possible to talk inside?

56:51.905 --> 56:54.425
Maybe I should phone my husband first.

56:55.585 --> 56:57.424
Of course, ma'am. Yeah. I'll wait.

56:57.425 --> 56:58.785
OK.
