00:01.320 --> 00:03.070
Previously on damages...

00:03.090 --> 00:07.820
Why would the lead counsel of an
energy company be defending a hooker?

00:07.860 --> 00:11.770
There was someone else
in the car: Finn garrety.

00:11.810 --> 00:12.840
You screwed up.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.110
But he's in the unique
position to help us.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.450
- I caught wind of something you should know.
- Okay...

00:17.460 --> 00:18.420
It's about your wife.

00:18.460 --> 00:20.650
You have to forget
about this whole thing.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.480
Patty, kendrick is too well connected.

00:22.510 --> 00:24.590
Frobisher had my fianc? killed.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.970
Frobisher is the only shareholder
who is willing to sue right now.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.740
You're going to stop all
contact with patty hewes.

00:30.770 --> 00:32.290
How'd you find me?

00:32.320 --> 00:33.990
You have to take a vacation.

00:34.020 --> 00:35.660
It's because of that girl we went after?

00:35.680 --> 00:37.360
How long have you known uncle pete?

00:37.390 --> 00:38.560
Since I was a kid.

00:38.590 --> 00:43.070
If pete mckee knows where patty's
skeleton's are buried, we'll find them.

00:43.100 --> 00:47.340
You give us patty hewes, or are you
going to abandon your dying wife?

00:47.350 --> 00:50.660
I've got to give stefania
her medication before i leave.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.170
Can't sleep?

01:34.710 --> 01:37.030
David?

01:37.570 --> 01:39.190
You're not dreaming.

01:39.210 --> 01:43.570
Technically speaking, you're
having a hypnopompic hallucination.

01:43.580 --> 01:46.750
Your mind doesn't know
if it's asleep or awake.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.850
I-I only take them when I can't sleep.

01:59.670 --> 02:02.510
- I had to move out of the apartment.
- Good.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.450
I always hated that place.

02:05.460 --> 02:09.280
David, I'M... I'm so sorry.

02:09.289 --> 02:13.040
You were right. You were
right about everything.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.780
Ah, it's okay.

02:14.810 --> 02:19.100
I just want to know why you
haven't opened your wedding present.

02:24.780 --> 02:27.060
I really... I don't know.

02:27.470 --> 02:31.910
It's nothing special. But
you'll know what it means.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.550
And it'll make you laugh.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.070
is that patty?

02:43.460 --> 02:44.780
It's the fbi.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.260
Oh, that's right. You're a fow n.

02:48.270 --> 02:51.000
An informant.

02:51.470 --> 02:54.200
You want to get that?

02:55.290 --> 02:58.590
I'll just be one minute. Okay?

03:04.200 --> 03:06.740
- David?
- Ellen?

03:08.430 --> 03:10.410
- Ellen?
- What is it?

03:10.420 --> 03:13.660
Pkee mce tried to kill himself.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.310
Is he going to live?

03:17.340 --> 03:18.600
We don't know.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.980
Why did pete do this?

04:07.440 --> 04:09.860
I don't know.

04:11.060 --> 04:16.300
But last night, he
bring home two clients.

04:16.730 --> 04:19.700
It's strange he never did that before.

04:20.019 --> 04:22.780
Whose clients were they?

04:22.790 --> 04:25.260
He say yours.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.280
But I think maybe they be no clients.

04:30.610 --> 04:33.500
They go away with him.

04:34.390 --> 04:37.590
But then I go to bathroom...

04:38.200 --> 04:41.250
and I find pills.

04:41.690 --> 04:44.670
Peter take pills.

04:49.450 --> 04:51.990
He left this.

04:59.740 --> 05:03.260
Please to god... let him wake up.

05:03.270 --> 05:07.480
Please. Please, please...

05:26.410 --> 05:27.900
Where's my wife?

05:27.930 --> 05:30.190
I told you not to come back here drunk.

05:30.210 --> 05:31.760
Where's my goddamn wife?

05:31.780 --> 05:34.040
She doesn't want to see
you. Neither does patty.

05:34.050 --> 05:36.860
Get out of my way, pete.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.600
What the hell happened?

05:47.630 --> 05:50.860
Pete swallowed a bottle
of his wife's meds.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.380
Why?

05:52.390 --> 05:54.550
So that he wouldn't have to
give us evidence on patty.

05:54.590 --> 05:56.510
We got him to the hospital,
but he's in a coma.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.220
What did patty say?

05:58.230 --> 06:01.790
She knows about the overdose,
but she has no idea why.

06:02.090 --> 06:05.380
We got surveillance in place
to monitor the situation.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.940
What's gonna happen if
he regains consciousness?

06:07.960 --> 06:09.310
We still got leverage on him.

06:09.340 --> 06:10.690
He wakes up, he's got to make a choice.

06:10.700 --> 06:14.140
He either gives us
patty or he goes to jail.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.690
So you said on the phone
there's an opportunity.

06:20.710 --> 06:25.010
Phil, there's a thing people say when they
want you to do something you don't want to do.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.260
What's that?

06:27.310 --> 06:30.460
You're gonna thank me someday.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.280
Invest in unr.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.510
Look, we've done a lot of
business together over the years.

06:36.540 --> 06:38.120
Have I ever steered you wrong?

06:38.160 --> 06:43.510
Dave, I've gone over all of the
data, and this merger is a dud.

06:43.520 --> 06:49.680
Grapevine says walter kendrick has
assembled a group of private investors,

06:50.550 --> 06:55.030
and they're about to invest a
significant amount of capital.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.430
A very significant amount.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.590
There's also a conflict
of interest here.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.960
And I think the world of your wife.

07:02.970 --> 07:05.740
But the basis for her, uh,

07:05.800 --> 07:10.110
shareholder suit was the
plunge in unr's stock price.

07:10.120 --> 07:15.210
It's gonna start creeping up,
and she's gonna lose this one.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.480
Patty doesn't lose.

07:19.520 --> 07:23.900
The stock will rise,
the case will vanish.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.960
We'll see.

07:27.970 --> 07:31.080
Invest in unr, phil.

07:31.110 --> 07:34.050
Someday, you're gonna thank me.

07:45.550 --> 07:48.410
This is where it happened.

07:49.050 --> 07:52.120
I was standing right here.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.520
I was looking that way.

07:58.740 --> 08:01.700
And I turned...

08:11.610 --> 08:15.550
- This is a key moment in your healing process.
- Yeah.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.060
listen... about that.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.240
See, I own all this land, manu.

08:26.280 --> 08:30.070
You know, I could, I could just as easily
sell it and be done with it, you know.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.909
I could, I could just
put all of this behind me.

08:34.380 --> 08:39.080
But this patch of earth changed my life.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.860
How can I help you, arthur?

08:41.900 --> 08:47.090
I want to build a healing center right on this
very spot, and I want you to run it for me.

08:47.130 --> 08:50.860
- A healing center?
- Yeah.

08:51.200 --> 08:57.540
Yeah. Look, see, we could, uh, you know, we could
do the, that holotropic, uh, breathing thing.

08:57.550 --> 08:58.980
We could do that over here.

08:59.010 --> 09:03.240
And then we could have, uh, the
drumming circle right in this area.

09:03.270 --> 09:06.080
And then out back, you
could have stables for the,

09:06.100 --> 09:08.000
- uh, you know, that thing they do with the horses.
- Equine therapy.

09:08.010 --> 09:09.540
Yes, exactly.

09:09.580 --> 09:13.890
It'll be like one-stop shopping for all
the shit that we've been doing together.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.720
What do you think?

09:15.750 --> 09:19.910
Hey, wait, wait, wait, look.
I want to show you this.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.310
This is the bullet that he shot me with.

09:23.340 --> 09:25.690
I mean, they had to tweeze
that out of my kidney.

09:25.740 --> 09:28.640
Well, we're gonna put
it right down here.

09:28.650 --> 09:32.440
I'm gonna bury this. there.

09:33.570 --> 09:38.500
Consider that the cornerstone
of-of this whole place.

09:42.770 --> 09:46.030
Why are you looking skeptical?

09:46.040 --> 09:48.500
Every gesture has two sides.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.060
One faces the sun, the other darkness.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.260
No, I-I know that. I know.

09:52.270 --> 09:57.010
As part of your ongoing journey, building
a healing center is an excellent idea.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.470
- But if it's a shortcut to peace, arthur...
- No, no, no, no, no, it's not, it's not.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.760
Listen to me, listen.

10:03.180 --> 10:09.380
My entire life, I've pursued the wrong things,
and I've been, I've been shackled to negativity.

10:09.390 --> 10:13.020
I've been guarded, I've been
competitive and calculating--

10:13.090 --> 10:15.690
all that stuff that we talk about.

10:15.700 --> 10:19.990
See, this... this could
be my new beginning.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.080
Then you have my blessing.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.650
Thank you, manu.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.560
Mrs. Mckee.

10:42.570 --> 10:46.950
Patrick... is that you?

10:48.030 --> 10:49.960
I thought you went away.

10:49.990 --> 10:53.510
I came back when i heard
pete was in the hospital.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.120
- Yeah.
- What happened?

10:57.220 --> 11:00.730
There's trouble for
peter. Someone rat on him.

11:00.740 --> 11:02.680
Who?

11:03.630 --> 11:08.050
I don't know, but the men
from government, they come.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.270
They want information.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.650
Information about what?

11:12.690 --> 11:15.910
His boss. I must go.

11:16.650 --> 11:18.760
Where are you going?

11:18.800 --> 11:22.240
I go to store to get licorice for peter.

11:22.250 --> 11:27.020
Uh, you want a lift? I'll take you.

11:28.490 --> 11:32.120
Uh, yeah, thank you, patrick.

11:40.220 --> 11:43.250
Oh, I'm sorry. I saw the light on.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.640
It's all right. Come in, sit.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.180
How's uncle pete doing?

11:59.970 --> 12:02.990
He's still unconscious.

12:09.260 --> 12:12.220
Have I ever told you about my father?

12:12.230 --> 12:14.360
No.

12:14.390 --> 12:18.960
He was A... complicated man.

12:19.670 --> 12:25.010
Brilliant, I think,
but frustrated, angry,

12:25.430 --> 12:27.300
never accomplished what he wanted to,

12:27.330 --> 12:33.210
and then one day he
just picked up and left.

12:36.770 --> 12:39.950
That's when pete stepped in.

12:40.620 --> 12:42.770
He was your mother's brother, right?

12:42.780 --> 12:45.360
Her screwup brother.

12:46.180 --> 12:49.610
He was always in trouble,
in and out of jail.

12:52.830 --> 12:55.910
But he took care of us.

12:59.470 --> 13:03.520
You warned me that this would happen.

13:05.310 --> 13:11.740
When the fbi came to you, and you turned
them down, then they went after pete.

13:13.150 --> 13:16.650
I think he was protecting me.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.390
Does pete have anything
incriminating on you?

13:24.080 --> 13:28.420
If he wakes up, patty, the
feds could still flip him.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.440
What are we gonna do?

13:33.040 --> 13:37.610
The only thing
we can do-- wait.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.420
Mr. Frobisher.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.710
For christ's sake. Who are you?

13:52.220 --> 13:54.440
He works for me.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.880
So now you bring someone
along to intimidate me?

13:59.900 --> 14:03.160
No, he has information.

14:03.180 --> 14:04.890
He's been keeping an
eye on ellen parsons.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.340
Well, wh-what the hell for?

14:06.350 --> 14:08.880
She believes you're
behind her fianc? s murder.

14:09.350 --> 14:12.440
You, you come here and
talk this kind of crap?

14:12.460 --> 14:16.990
Hey, asshole, you want to ignore
what I've got to say, fine, go ahead.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.280
- What is this?
- Listen to him.

14:19.290 --> 14:23.380
When you were in the hospital,
ellen parsons visited you.

14:24.130 --> 14:30.100
She stood at your bedside, deciding
whether she wanted you dead.

14:31.630 --> 14:33.800
How could you possibly know that?

14:33.830 --> 14:37.060
She told me. She tells
me a lot of things.

14:37.070 --> 14:40.370
You're lucky I've been
keeping an eye on her.

14:40.640 --> 14:45.820
But she has been using patty hewes'
firm to investigate her fianc? s murder.

14:45.830 --> 14:49.560
I am not gonna let anyone connect
that to us, do you understand?

14:49.580 --> 14:53.140
You know, I am sick of this shit!*****

14:54.090 --> 14:57.210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:57.220 --> 14:59.260
I'm not gonna tell you this again.

14:59.270 --> 15:01.620
You're gonna drop this lawsuit.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.170
No, I'm not.

15:06.200 --> 15:12.040
If parsons traces this back to either
of us, there will be consequences.

15:13.630 --> 15:19.690
Every action has two sides-- one
faces the sun, the other, darkness.

15:20.830 --> 15:21.780
And what does that mean?

15:21.800 --> 15:27.250
It means I am prepared to take responsibility,
but you, you are still stuck in the past.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.520
I'm not. I'm free.

15:29.530 --> 15:33.740
Today, I am... I-I walk without fear.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.360
Thanks for meeting me.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.240
I just wanted to make sure
there was a friendly face.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.960
Listen, it'll be good for me, too.

15:58.020 --> 16:00.980
Actually, I haven't been
coming as much as I should.

16:01.220 --> 16:05.450
Ellen, welcome back. Have a seat.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.820
David sent me a wedding gift.

16:10.940 --> 16:14.200
It was sent to our old apartment.

16:14.210 --> 16:16.530
And what was the gift?

16:17.240 --> 16:21.530
I don't know. I haven't
opened it. I can'T.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.830
Why not?

16:25.650 --> 16:29.850
Maybe I'm protecting myself.

16:30.330 --> 16:32.680
How so?

16:32.690 --> 16:34.940
I don't want to be reminded of the past.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.030
I'm trying to move on.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.870
- I don't think so.
- Wes.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.720
No, it's okay. What were you gonna say?

16:46.340 --> 16:50.680
That gift, whatever it is...

16:53.410 --> 16:59.310
it's your last piece of david. Once you
open it, it's over. There'll be nothing left.

17:00.910 --> 17:06.829
But if you don't, you'll always have one
more moment with him to look forward to.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.640
Isn't that the opposite of moving on?

17:22.829 --> 17:25.349
What did the doctors say?

17:26.130 --> 17:29.080
It's possible pete will never wake up.

17:32.520 --> 17:38.560
I know you have a lot on your mind right now,
but, I've gotten some new information on unr.

17:40.550 --> 17:42.660
Yes?

17:42.700 --> 17:46.990
Apparently, they're expecting
an influx of capital,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.200
and the word is it's gonna
turn the stock around.

17:50.810 --> 17:54.770
Who would put up the capital?
Everyone knows it's a bad merger.

17:59.630 --> 18:05.790
Last week, unr's lead counsel
was in a courtroom in new jersey

18:05.800 --> 18:09.030
defending a prostitute on drug charges.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.480
Don't tell me she was
schtupping walter kendrick?

18:12.510 --> 18:17.730
No, she was with an energy trader...

18:17.740 --> 18:19.590
finn garrety.

18:19.610 --> 18:24.390
Now, apparently,
garrety devises formulas

18:24.400 --> 18:27.280
for speculating on energy futures.

18:27.310 --> 18:31.100
And you think he might have something
to do with unr's new capital?

18:31.110 --> 18:37.960
Kendrick could be using him to
manipulate the energy market;

18:37.970 --> 18:41.100
hold back supply,
drive up the price--

18:41.130 --> 18:45.830
they'd make a killing and
get the capital they need.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.610
Susie?

18:56.060 --> 18:58.240
Ms.Samble?

18:59.430 --> 19:00.570
Who are you?

19:00.580 --> 19:03.390
Hopefully, a friend, but
that will be up to you.

19:04.070 --> 19:07.250
I'm sorry, I don't know you.
Have we had a date before?

19:07.260 --> 19:08.950
No, no.

19:08.990 --> 19:12.560
Well, if you want to book my
time, please go to the web site.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.930
Actually, I'd like a couple of minutes
to ask you a question about finn garrety.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.920
Should that name mean something?

19:18.970 --> 19:20.780
I hope so.You were arrested
with him a couple of weeks ago

19:20.790 --> 19:23.480
when he was up in your hotel room.

19:23.970 --> 19:25.750
What do you want?

19:25.780 --> 19:28.540
How do you know claire maddox?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.040
I don'T.

19:31.660 --> 19:36.860
Look, lonnie, I know your johns want you to
lie to them, but I want honest intercourse.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.080
Who are you?

19:38.120 --> 19:39.830
I'm an attorney...

19:39.880 --> 19:44.100
who knows that if a hooker gets a corporate
litigator to defend her on cocaine charges,

19:44.110 --> 19:46.120
it ain't because she's a good lay.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.580
Go screw yourself.

19:47.630 --> 19:50.020
I may have to, due to our
obvious lack of chemistry.

19:50.030 --> 19:52.010
I'm trying to help you here, lonnie.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.520
You've let some very dangerous
people into your life.

19:54.530 --> 19:55.570
I'm gonna prosecute them.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.980
Either you can talk to me, or
I'm gonna take you down with them.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.440
Here'S... here's my cell.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.920
I'd hate to see you end up on
the wrong side of this thing.

20:18.850 --> 20:22.720
Yeah, look, I want to take
a position in unr. No, long.

20:22.730 --> 20:28.290
I'm looking to buy. I'm watching it right
now. I think it's due for a turnaround.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.810
And do me a favor-- run this
through the subsidiary fund.

20:32.820 --> 20:35.950
I want to keep this quiet.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.450
All right.

20:40.140 --> 20:43.410
I swear, you should have seen the
size of this guy i laid out. Bow!

20:43.420 --> 20:45.660
One punch.

20:46.180 --> 20:49.450
Get out of here. Get out of here.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.580
Where you been, patrick?

20:53.590 --> 20:56.260
- What happened, mikey?
- What happened when?

20:59.720 --> 21:01.300
I heard pete was set up; who was it?

21:01.330 --> 21:03.980
Timmy. Timmy mcadams!

21:05.010 --> 21:08.910
We get pinched selling
bootlegs. The feds talk to us.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.290
Next thing I know, they grab up pete.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.180
I'm worried, patrick.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.650
Pete could turn us all in.

21:22.700 --> 21:27.000
Shut your mouth. Pete
would never do that.

21:55.290 --> 21:57.270
Nurse!

22:04.280 --> 22:07.070
Hello, pete.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.780
You remember me?

22:13.610 --> 22:16.640
Where's the other asshole?

22:16.650 --> 22:21.790
He's, uh... out in the waiting
room, talking to your lovely wife.

22:24.150 --> 22:28.070
God, I wish... I wish
they'd fed me through a tube.

22:28.410 --> 22:32.210
I am so sick of all that chewing.

22:32.220 --> 22:35.600
You've got something
to say to me, say it.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.820
Well... we know you
have evidence on patty.

22:41.190 --> 22:44.600
Why else would you try to off yourself?

22:46.780 --> 22:49.460
Your wife...

22:49.470 --> 22:53.290
was devastated by your little stunt.

22:53.300 --> 22:58.420
If you were gone, how long do you
think she would make it without you?

22:59.800 --> 23:02.110
Go to hell.

23:03.220 --> 23:07.870
I... guess we're back where we started.

23:08.690 --> 23:11.480
What's it gonna be, pete?

23:11.520 --> 23:15.330
Your wife... or patty hewes?

23:18.940 --> 23:22.920
You are going to a prison hospital.

23:23.960 --> 23:27.760
You got to decide, pete.

23:30.670 --> 23:33.870
Get me a bedpan. I got to take a shit.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.050
All right, that's right.

23:36.060 --> 23:38.920
You do what daddy tells you.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.890
What are you trading?

23:40.930 --> 23:44.950
Baby, I told you, this
is work, this is pleasure.

23:51.230 --> 23:54.530
There's another deal... done.

23:55.460 --> 23:57.920
Undress me.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.860
Finn, yesterday...

24:04.900 --> 24:08.350
a guy came up to me and started
asking questions about you.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.070
What guy?

24:10.150 --> 24:12.230
- He didn't give a name.
- What guy?

24:12.240 --> 24:14.570
He said he was an attorney.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.820
Now he's an attorney?
An attorney for who?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.680
- He didn't say.
- What did you tell him about me?

24:18.690 --> 24:20.400
- Nothing.
- What did you tell him about me?

24:20.410 --> 24:23.350
Nothing! What do i even know about you?

24:23.730 --> 24:27.990
Look, if you're... if you're
lying to me, you're dead.

24:33.580 --> 24:36.400
All right, don't talk to him ever again.

24:36.420 --> 24:38.620
I won'T.

24:42.610 --> 24:45.820
I'm sorry I said that
thing about you being dead.

24:51.100 --> 24:53.680
All right, now undress me.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.460
Am I interrupting?

25:07.470 --> 25:11.240
There is no interruption.
Though arthur's not here.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.940
I read your book.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.460
That rabbit reminds
me of a story you told.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.800
Oh, yes?

25:17.810 --> 25:22.300
A monkey, an otter,
a jackal and a rabbit

25:22.310 --> 25:25.150
each decide to practice charity.

25:30.340 --> 25:33.770
A blind man comes
along begging for food.

25:34.170 --> 25:38.190
So the monkey gathers fruit for
him, the otter gathers fish...

25:38.220 --> 25:44.000
And the rabbit, only able to gather
grass, makes the ultimate sacrifice.

25:44.590 --> 25:50.610
He throws himself on the fire so
the old man's hunger may be sated.

25:51.140 --> 25:56.500
And when the blind man sits down to eat, the jackal
slits his throat and takes the bounty for himself.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.700
That is not the ending.

26:01.710 --> 26:04.470
No?

26:07.500 --> 26:10.450
Can I hold him?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.900
Why have you come?

26:24.910 --> 26:29.200
Long before you were arthur's teacher...

26:29.240 --> 26:32.200
he sought my guidance.

26:32.210 --> 26:37.910
I want you to tell him
that he is still my pupil.

26:39.920 --> 26:43.350
My lessons are not finished.

26:59.270 --> 27:01.850
What did they arrest you for?

27:01.890 --> 27:05.770
They witnessed me receiving a payoff.

27:05.810 --> 27:07.600
They flipped one of my boys.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.690
He told them everything.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.940
The feds have got me by the balls.

27:13.820 --> 27:17.030
You promised me you'd stop.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.350
Why, pete?

27:19.410 --> 27:25.520
It's just... well, you know me, patty.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.410
I really screwed things up for you.

27:31.330 --> 27:33.750
I failed you worse than your old man.

27:33.780 --> 27:35.270
Don't say that.

27:35.310 --> 27:39.450
If I wasn't such a goddamn screwup, I would
have taken more pills and finished the job right.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.820
Why didn't you come to me?

27:42.830 --> 27:44.910
We can fight the feds in court.

27:44.950 --> 27:48.630
They've got enough on me to put
me away for the rest of my life.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.850
What did the feds ask you for?

28:05.430 --> 28:08.730
Everything I've got on you.

28:09.150 --> 28:14.520
If I don't give them enough to put
you in jail, they're putting me there.

28:19.580 --> 28:24.130
The man with the beard came to
see me. He is not your friend.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.860
What'd he want?

28:27.510 --> 28:33.320
Remember, arthur, whatever he may do to your
physical embodiment, he cannot touch your soul.

28:34.300 --> 28:38.150
My physical embodiment?
Did he threaten me?

28:39.100 --> 28:43.640
I believe he... wished me
to convey that message, yes.

28:46.010 --> 28:50.750
I've begun to think, perhaps, you
have set these events in motion.

28:53.260 --> 28:56.070
Yes, I did.

28:57.460 --> 29:01.400
Are there authorities
to which you can appeal?

29:01.410 --> 29:04.240
No, no, no, i can't go to the police.

29:04.300 --> 29:08.050
Arthur, you have invited
a jackal into your life.

29:08.740 --> 29:13.870
And it is the jackal's nature to
hunt until he has made his kill.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.650
What's that supposed to mean?

29:18.710 --> 29:21.240
It means you
have a choice--

29:21.250 --> 29:25.200
you must either spend the rest of
your life running from this man...

29:25.800 --> 29:30.560
or turn yourself in and face
the repercussions of your past.

29:33.080 --> 29:36.280
That's my choice?

29:39.150 --> 29:42.700
I'm sure your decision
will be well considered.

30:03.160 --> 30:07.420
Yeah, I need to see you. Right away.

30:10.300 --> 30:15.570
Oh, god! Oh, god! you are y! Bad h!

30:16.130 --> 30:19.520
More! Mo! Go, d!

30:19.530 --> 30:21.210
Oh, you stallion!

30:25.360 --> 30:27.380
oh, god, yes!

30:28.730 --> 30:31.080
oh, god.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.000
oh, god.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.660
Oh, yes.

30:38.260 --> 30:41.520
oh, you just keep
getting better and better.

30:41.750 --> 30:44.530
Get off, will you?

30:45.860 --> 30:49.660
Yeah. I'll do it.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.460
- You have a daughter to think about.
- Get out of my way!

30:59.470 --> 31:02.000
- One step closer, and I'll clock you.
- Stop it!

31:03.060 --> 31:07.120
Both of you, stop it! Get out,
pete. Let me talk to my husband.

31:24.950 --> 31:26.940
Hey, there, patty.

31:44.810 --> 31:46.990
Hey, there.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.140
Can I ask you something?

31:52.990 --> 31:55.710
Why did you stick around?

31:56.090 --> 31:57.550
When?

31:57.590 --> 31:59.990
When dad took off.

32:01.230 --> 32:05.140
You didn't owe us anything.

32:07.150 --> 32:09.490
You could've left, too.

32:10.580 --> 32:15.270
No responsibility, no debts.

32:17.090 --> 32:20.310
I know you never wanted a family.

32:22.890 --> 32:25.830
Why did you take care of us?

32:37.940 --> 32:40.570
I don't know.

32:43.540 --> 32:46.690
You give them whatever you need to.

32:46.700 --> 32:50.010
- No.
- Yes.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.080
What do you think?

32:54.110 --> 32:57.350
I don't buy it. There's
no way she'll let him talk.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.780
I had one thing on her,
and she tried to kill me.

33:00.820 --> 33:03.740
Can you imagine what pete knows?

33:08.470 --> 33:11.200
Save yourself.

33:21.140 --> 33:24.630
All right. I'll give you what you want.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.710
Good.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.230
I'll drop the suit.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.340
And the funds I need?

33:32.370 --> 33:35.120
Same arrangement as before.

33:36.910 --> 33:39.040
Yes, sir.

33:40.550 --> 33:43.020
Yeah.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.500
Well, you know how to contact me.

33:54.870 --> 33:57.610
Lonnie.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.770
You ready to talk?

34:04.090 --> 34:08.550
Did I mention the woman who was murdered
because her husband wouldn't play ball?

34:10.400 --> 34:12.389
I'm scared of finn.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.429
What can you tell me about him?

34:14.469 --> 34:17.010
He's got money everywhere.

34:17.020 --> 34:23.730
I don't understand any of it, but
he's got companies hidden in companies.

34:24.340 --> 34:27.360
He plays markets all over the world.

34:27.639 --> 34:30.050
What else?

34:30.060 --> 34:31.949
If I talk to you, i need protection.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.790
Well, I can provide that.

34:33.810 --> 34:37.580
Does finn know a guy by
the name of walter kendrick?

34:37.600 --> 34:39.060
I-I don't know.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.610
Well, can you try to find out?

34:42.310 --> 34:44.679
I'll see what I can do.

34:46.190 --> 34:50.250
Keep it. When the time comes,
I'll let you know what I want.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.920
Frobisher's dropped out of the case.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.250
Why?

34:59.290 --> 35:03.570
He said all the media attention was
interfering with his path to spirituality.

35:04.550 --> 35:06.650
Of course it is.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.270
But we got what we needed.

35:09.300 --> 35:13.640
Dozens of plaintiffs jumping on board, all
having sold their shares at rock bottom.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.150
Sounds like a
full-fledged class action.

35:17.180 --> 35:19.330
Any progress with lonnie samble?

35:19.370 --> 35:22.900
I think she's almost ready to talk.

35:22.910 --> 35:25.190
Good.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.790
How you feeling?

35:29.830 --> 35:32.220
What are you doing here?

35:32.240 --> 35:36.040
I told you to get out of
town. You've got to go.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.150
No one can see us here together.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.130
Is it because of what
we did for your boss?

35:46.030 --> 35:49.890
No, it has nothing to do with you.

35:50.340 --> 35:55.550
Stefania said the feds want
you to give them information.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.130
- Who is that guy?
- I don't know.

35:57.140 --> 35:59.560
- You don't recognize his voice?
- No.

36:02.490 --> 36:06.480
If I don't, I go to prison.

36:08.790 --> 36:11.320
Get in there and see if you can id him.

36:11.330 --> 36:14.050
What are you gonna do?

36:14.060 --> 36:18.880
This is my problem. You have to go, now.

36:18.890 --> 36:23.330
You're gonna have to give the feds
something big to keep you out of jail.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.280
You're safe, patrick.

36:28.090 --> 36:33.710
Whatever I decide, I
won't tell them about you.

36:49.570 --> 36:54.060
- Need anything before I go?
- No. I'm fine.

36:54.960 --> 37:00.300
Listen, this is gonna
mean good-bye, patrick.

37:05.730 --> 37:09.510
You've got to get out of town for good.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.540
Hi, there.

37:30.330 --> 37:33.470
Take care, pete.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.760
Oh, my god.

38:10.830 --> 38:14.070
- This is patty.
- It's me.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.340
Patty, I called the
hospital to check in on pete.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.270
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

38:24.810 --> 38:27.460
When?

38:31.780 --> 38:34.490
Mikey, come get me.

38:42.190 --> 38:45.290
- Let's go before patty hewes finds out.
- Are we safe?

38:45.930 --> 38:48.990
Pete mckee won't be talking to anyone.

39:19.420 --> 39:22.320
Hey, there, patty.

39:24.790 --> 39:27.610
How about we get you some licorice?

39:28.580 --> 39:31.410
Okay, uncle pete.

39:43.950 --> 39:47.030
<i>******</i>

40:27.480 --> 40:29.500
Mrs. Mckee.

40:29.510 --> 40:34.450
I found something in peter's
closet that has your name.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.820
Actually...

40:42.230 --> 40:44.770
I take that back.

40:47.370 --> 40:49.950
You should be scared.

40:51.050 --> 40:54.210
You should be terrified.

40:54.220 --> 40:57.230
Ellen, don'T.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.760
It's not who you are.

41:04.420 --> 41:08.480
You're right. You know me too well.

41:09.180 --> 41:11.910
I would never use this.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.050
It's not even loaded.

41:17.990 --> 41:21.120
So it's just the two of us.

41:21.360 --> 41:24.320
Face-to-face.

41:24.710 --> 41:27.000
Just the two of us.
