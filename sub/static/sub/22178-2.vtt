00:00.043 --> 00:02.359
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.362 --> 00:03.918
- Who are you?
- I'm your daughter.

00:03.921 --> 00:05.044
I don't have a daughter.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.328
You just don't remember
because you're cursed.

00:07.331 --> 00:10.239
Come with me to my
neighborhood, Hyperion Heights.

00:10.242 --> 00:12.408
You can meet your true
love... Cinderella.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.145
My step-grandma, Cinderella's
step-mom, is trying

00:15.147 --> 00:17.080
to bring people from this world in

00:17.082 --> 00:19.182
so all the fairy-tale
characters move out.

00:19.184 --> 00:21.885
Everyone will lose
each other... forever.

00:55.554 --> 00:57.851
"Always watch the blade." I got it.

00:57.854 --> 00:59.556
Wow. I'm impressed.

00:59.558 --> 01:01.224
You fight like your grandfather.

01:01.226 --> 01:02.759
Mom, we're practicing.

01:02.761 --> 01:04.694
Actually, we just finished.

01:04.696 --> 01:07.163
Like I told you... always
keep your eye on the blade.

01:07.165 --> 01:09.399
What's the point? I'm
never gonna be good enough.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.532
What's going on with him lately?

01:16.701 --> 01:18.667
I think you know, Emma.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.009
He's almost grown.

01:20.011 --> 01:21.578
He's about to leave home, isn't he?

01:23.748 --> 01:24.781
Aye.

01:24.783 --> 01:26.035
I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:26.038 --> 01:27.237
What, to stop him?

01:27.240 --> 01:29.052
I missed so much already.
I don't want to...

01:29.054 --> 01:32.722
This isn't an ending, Emma.

01:32.724 --> 01:34.524
There's more to come.

01:34.526 --> 01:35.792
But we don't know for sure.

01:35.794 --> 01:37.894
What if I don't get a second chance?

01:37.896 --> 01:39.629
It's gonna be okay.

01:39.631 --> 01:42.198
I have something to make
things a little less terrifying.

01:47.138 --> 01:49.572
A little bottle of rum?
Because I wouldn't say no.

01:49.574 --> 01:51.407
It's a little bottle of magic.

01:51.409 --> 01:54.333
You speak your message in here,

01:54.341 --> 01:56.679
add the name of your favorite
pirate, drop it in the water,

01:56.681 --> 01:58.982
and before you can say "Yo-ho-ho,"

01:58.984 --> 02:00.450
it'll find the person you seek.

02:00.452 --> 02:01.618
A message in a bottle.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.186
Mm-hmm.

02:03.188 --> 02:04.520
Thank you.

02:04.522 --> 02:06.189
Look, he's grown into a fine young lad,

02:06.191 --> 02:09.268
and he is lucky to
have a mother like you.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.038
He's lucky to have a pirate like you.

02:16.067 --> 02:18.434
He's gonna be fine.

02:36.148 --> 02:38.254
That's the man who helped Cinderella

02:38.256 --> 02:39.956
kill our beloved prince.

02:39.958 --> 02:41.057
She didn't kill him.

02:41.059 --> 02:42.926
The royal family disagrees.

02:42.928 --> 02:44.688
Where is she? Tell me.

02:44.691 --> 02:46.115
Never.

02:46.118 --> 02:48.097
So...

02:48.099 --> 02:50.366
You're in love with her.

02:50.368 --> 02:51.534
Didn't say that.

02:51.536 --> 02:53.336
You were spotted with
something of hers...

02:53.338 --> 02:54.771
A glass slipper.

02:54.773 --> 02:56.773
Give it to me, and you can live.

02:56.775 --> 02:58.241
Sorry, lady, I hid it.

02:58.243 --> 03:00.209
And you're not gonna get it.

03:00.211 --> 03:02.812
Although... I do have
something else made of glass.

03:02.814 --> 03:04.380
And that bottle's going to save you?

03:04.382 --> 03:05.982
Not all by itself.

03:05.984 --> 03:07.784
Help. I've been captured
by Lady Tremaine.

03:07.786 --> 03:10.086
-Stop him. 
-Send Emma, Regina, and Captain Hook.

03:10.088 --> 03:11.177
Stop him!

03:25.437 --> 03:26.970
_

03:30.208 --> 03:32.909
Officer Rogers. Uh... h-hey. Hi.

03:32.911 --> 03:34.744
Why are you here at 6:00 in the morning?

03:34.746 --> 03:37.213
I have some questions that can't wait.

03:37.215 --> 03:39.482
Would you like some coffee?

03:39.484 --> 03:41.117
Look, if this is about Jacinda and Lucy,

03:41.119 --> 03:42.819
I already feel terrible
about what I did.

03:42.821 --> 03:44.988
No, no, no, no. This is...

03:46.333 --> 03:47.599
about something else.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.459
I read your book, and
there's something in there

03:49.461 --> 03:51.127
that I can't get out of my head.

03:51.129 --> 03:52.362
So, um....

03:52.364 --> 03:54.130
Can you tell me who this woman is?

03:54.132 --> 03:56.432
Yeah... She's a, uh, character,

03:56.434 --> 03:59.415
in a book of fiction.

03:59.418 --> 04:00.536
I understand that.

04:00.538 --> 04:04.807
Um... I feel like I've met her before.

04:04.809 --> 04:06.642
Now, did you base her on someone?

04:06.644 --> 04:09.145
Somebody real?

04:09.147 --> 04:12.814
Truth is... I made her up.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.183
Okay.

04:14.186 --> 04:15.618
Sorry to bother you.

04:18.023 --> 04:20.423
Actually, um... while you're here,

04:20.425 --> 04:22.392
there's something, maybe,
you can help me with.

04:22.394 --> 04:25.811
I've been trying to find
where some family of mine...

04:25.814 --> 04:27.501
are buried.

04:27.504 --> 04:29.432
I keep hitting dead ends.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.834
It's not exactly my department, but...

04:31.836 --> 04:33.069
I'll see what I can do.

04:33.071 --> 04:34.137
Thank you.

04:34.139 --> 04:36.631
Oh, and, uh...

04:36.634 --> 04:38.975
you were the one who picked
up Jacinda and Lucy, huh?

04:38.977 --> 04:40.866
- Yes.
- How are they?

04:40.869 --> 04:44.080
As of yesterday, not great.

04:51.756 --> 04:53.389
Lucy's ballet recital.

04:53.391 --> 04:55.124
Victoria was supposed to leave a ticket?

04:55.126 --> 04:57.060
And Mother decided that
the performance is now

04:57.062 --> 04:59.429
a charity event for
disadvantaged children.

04:59.431 --> 05:02.031
The tickets are $550
each. No exceptions.

05:02.033 --> 05:03.699
$550?

05:03.701 --> 05:06.702
I could always take a credit
card if cash flow is a problem.

05:10.241 --> 05:11.441
Hey!

05:11.443 --> 05:13.309
You know my paycheck is $500.

05:13.311 --> 05:14.811
You want this just out of reach.

05:14.813 --> 05:16.412
My assistant set the price.

05:16.414 --> 05:18.681
Come on, Victoria. I am trying here.

05:18.683 --> 05:20.416
I got my job back.

05:20.418 --> 05:22.085
I just want to see Lucy.

05:22.087 --> 05:24.257
People should be given a second chance.

05:24.260 --> 05:27.393
Second chances aren't
given. They're earned.

05:44.776 --> 05:48.010
This is where your lovely,
conniving Cinderella

05:48.012 --> 05:49.627
used to sleep.

05:49.630 --> 05:53.353
Sadly, this is as close
as you'll ever get to her.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.423
Find out where he hid the slipper.

06:00.425 --> 06:01.824
Then kill him.

06:01.826 --> 06:04.594
Cinderella must never
see that man again.

06:04.596 --> 06:06.129
But why? I don't understand.

06:06.131 --> 06:08.164
I don't need you to understand.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.765
I need you to obey.

06:12.849 --> 06:15.404
Whatever she wants you to do
to me, you don't have to do it.

06:15.406 --> 06:17.273
You seem a lot nicer than she is.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.444
I'm not.

06:24.353 --> 06:27.387
So...

06:27.390 --> 06:29.152
where did you hide the slipper?

06:39.364 --> 06:40.796
Get away from him... Now.

06:40.798 --> 06:41.764
And who are you?

06:41.766 --> 06:43.099
I'm his mother.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.804
Good to see you're
still in one piece, lad.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.771
Good to see you, too.

06:48.773 --> 06:50.573
And am I bloody glad that you sent this.

06:50.575 --> 06:51.674
That makes two of us.

06:54.712 --> 06:56.145
Mom.

06:56.147 --> 06:57.480
It's okay. I'm fine.

06:57.482 --> 06:59.015
Oh, Henry. You...

06:59.017 --> 07:00.850
You grew up.

07:00.852 --> 07:02.051
I did.

07:02.053 --> 07:03.152
You look good.

07:04.522 --> 07:05.555
I just...

07:05.557 --> 07:07.356
I know, I know. I missed you, too.

07:07.358 --> 07:09.058
Much as I love hugs and tears,

07:09.060 --> 07:10.626
can we do it outside
the torture chamber?

07:10.628 --> 07:13.129
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But
wait. Where's my other mom?

07:13.131 --> 07:15.464
Emma? Well, she's back in Storybrooke.

07:15.466 --> 07:18.367
She's fighting a swarm of
tiny, irritating dragons.

07:18.369 --> 07:19.669
Nothing she can't handle.

07:19.671 --> 07:23.306
Sounds like Mom. Okay,
come on. Come on. Let's go.

07:23.308 --> 07:25.341
What the hell was that?

07:25.343 --> 07:27.577
Why did you just lie to Henry?

07:27.579 --> 07:29.412
Because that's what Emma wanted.

07:29.414 --> 07:31.147
If he knew what really happened,

07:31.149 --> 07:32.815
he'd drop everything and come back.

07:32.817 --> 07:34.617
She wants to let him
get on with his life.

07:34.619 --> 07:35.885
Well, I think she's wrong.

07:35.887 --> 07:37.887
Well, that's not your decision.

07:37.889 --> 07:39.855
We have to respect Emma's wishes.

07:45.808 --> 07:48.510
First day as my partner...

07:48.512 --> 07:49.845
and you're late.

07:51.048 --> 07:52.813
But my shift doesn't
start for another hour.

07:52.816 --> 07:55.450
Do you know why you
were partnered with me?

07:55.452 --> 07:57.219
Because I work hard and I paid my dues.

07:57.221 --> 07:59.188
Because I chose you.

07:59.190 --> 08:01.089
Some of the boys said
"He can't do the job...

08:01.091 --> 08:03.892
Not with that fake hand of
his," but I picked you anyway.

08:03.894 --> 08:06.128
I don't even know you.
Why would you pick me?

08:06.130 --> 08:07.696
That's the real question, isn't it?

08:07.698 --> 08:10.715
Maybe someday, when you learn
how to become a real detective,

08:10.718 --> 08:12.134
you can answer it for yourself.

08:12.136 --> 08:14.670
Now, get in. Big day ahead of us.

08:14.672 --> 08:15.904
New guy drives.

08:18.042 --> 08:20.342
I promise you... You
will see Lucy tonight.

08:20.344 --> 08:21.810
Check it out.

08:21.812 --> 08:23.178
WorkBunny.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.846
It's an app for part-time jobs.

08:24.848 --> 08:25.847
Look at all these gigs.

08:25.849 --> 08:28.850
You can organize closets, fix a car...

08:28.852 --> 08:30.419
None of that will pay $550.

08:30.421 --> 08:32.788
Yeah, no, I know, but, you
know, like, cumulatively.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.722
By tonight?

08:34.725 --> 08:36.058
Hey.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.029
Oh, this is Henry.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.864
I got to hop.

08:42.866 --> 08:44.232
You've got five.

08:45.269 --> 08:47.736
Look, what I did yesterday was wrong.

08:47.738 --> 08:49.471
I should've just said "I'm sorry."

08:49.473 --> 08:52.274
So, this is me trying to apologize.

08:52.276 --> 08:55.043
I don't need apologies.
I need to see Lucy.

08:55.045 --> 08:57.546
And thanks to you, that now costs $550.

08:57.548 --> 08:58.914
Well, if you need cash,
I could help with that.

08:58.916 --> 09:00.291
I make okay money driving Swyft.

09:00.294 --> 09:02.017
No. Do not do that.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.852
Do not come in here trying to save me.

09:03.854 --> 09:05.554
No, I wasn't trying to sa... I know...

09:05.556 --> 09:08.490
Lucy may believe in
fairy tales, but I don't.

09:08.492 --> 09:10.459
I'm not a damsel waiting for a prince.

09:10.461 --> 09:11.932
I can earn my own money.

09:11.935 --> 09:14.563
She's my daughter. I'll figure
this out, fix what you broke.

09:14.565 --> 09:15.764
Jacinda, that's not fair.

09:15.766 --> 09:18.433
"Not fair" is being
separated from your kid.

09:20.604 --> 09:23.105
I am sorry.

09:23.107 --> 09:24.506
My break's over.

09:24.508 --> 09:26.008
I've got chicken to sell.

09:26.010 --> 09:27.442
And a ballet to attend.

09:32.783 --> 09:36.567
_

09:37.723 --> 09:39.321
Well, that's quite a look.

09:39.323 --> 09:41.890
You want them just to
wilt or burst into flames?

09:41.892 --> 09:45.227
I called you, Detective,
because I have a job for you.

09:45.229 --> 09:48.163
I need you both to make
a little problem go away...

09:48.165 --> 09:50.526
A sad little man named Henry Mills.

09:50.529 --> 09:54.603
Today, he was seen with
Jacinda at that bar again.

09:54.605 --> 09:56.738
He's a bad influence on my family.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.607
So, dig up something.

09:58.609 --> 10:02.411
Unless either of you
have a problem with that?

10:05.393 --> 10:06.759
What the hell was that?

10:06.762 --> 10:08.650
Why are we taking orders
from Victoria Belfrey?

10:08.652 --> 10:09.785
We don't work for her.

10:09.787 --> 10:12.054
You're right. We don't work for her.

10:12.056 --> 10:13.288
We work for me.

10:19.596 --> 10:21.196
My magic worked earlier.

10:25.402 --> 10:28.770
Location spell should be easy. I...

10:28.772 --> 10:30.205
I might have a way to help.

10:30.207 --> 10:31.406
Smell that?

10:31.408 --> 10:32.574
Salt water.

10:32.576 --> 10:34.509
We're near the sea, which
means there's a port.

10:34.511 --> 10:36.758
Where there are ports,
there are pirates.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.613
If a woman passed through
with a glass slipper,

10:38.615 --> 10:40.315
believe me, they'd know.

10:40.317 --> 10:42.351
Go to it, Pirate.

10:42.353 --> 10:43.985
And, uh...

10:43.987 --> 10:45.253
bring Henry with you.

10:45.255 --> 10:49.424
You know, it'll be a good
chance for you two to... talk.

10:50.928 --> 10:52.527
You're wanted in this realm, lad.

10:52.529 --> 10:54.262
I think it's probably best I go alone.

10:56.166 --> 10:59.468
Now, why are you in my bar?

10:59.470 --> 11:00.936
Well...

11:00.938 --> 11:04.373
You're the only one who
knows this town as well I do.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.376
I hear Henry Mills was in here today.

11:07.378 --> 11:09.177
Bartender's like a therapist.

11:09.179 --> 11:10.846
I don't share secrets.

11:10.848 --> 11:12.547
Is that so?

11:12.549 --> 11:13.849
Yep.

11:19.690 --> 11:21.823
Well, that's okay.

11:21.825 --> 11:23.358
I always get my answers.

11:27.946 --> 11:29.131
Pay for the drink.

11:33.337 --> 11:35.203
Hey. Even as a beat cop,

11:35.205 --> 11:38.974
I'm sure you've heard to be
careful around him, right?

11:38.976 --> 11:40.842
I can take care of myself.

11:40.844 --> 11:42.326
Yeah, but listen.

11:42.329 --> 11:44.179
Weaver brings a lot of
new partners in here,

11:44.181 --> 11:45.947
and not a lot of them come back.

11:45.949 --> 11:49.418
So ask yourself... How
badly do you want this job?

11:59.463 --> 12:01.897
Yo-ho-ho.

12:01.899 --> 12:03.999
Captain Hook.

12:04.001 --> 12:05.834
Who knows me in this world?

12:05.836 --> 12:07.035
Give me your name.

12:09.473 --> 12:13.133
Why would I give you my name...

12:13.136 --> 12:15.277
when you already have it?

12:17.014 --> 12:19.981
I've heard of you... Of
me, from that other realm...

12:19.983 --> 12:21.450
The one created by a wish.

12:21.452 --> 12:22.851
So Emma did mention me?

12:22.853 --> 12:25.887
It's always... nice
to make an impression.

12:25.889 --> 12:27.956
Yeah, like a bad dream.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.458
Everything in that realm

12:29.460 --> 12:32.994
was just a twisted version of the truth.

12:32.996 --> 12:34.729
Like a cracked mirror.

12:34.731 --> 12:35.831
You're not real.

12:35.833 --> 12:40.669
I am as real... as the night is long.

12:40.671 --> 12:42.137
Infinite realms.

12:42.139 --> 12:43.939
Infinite possibilities!

12:43.941 --> 12:45.774
You're just upset that
you aren't always you.

12:45.776 --> 12:47.943
So, tell me... what did that
sweet lass say about me, hmm?

12:47.945 --> 12:50.412
She told me she ran into a
drunken-fool version of me.

12:50.414 --> 12:54.549
What's the... what's the
matter, Captain Youthful?

12:54.551 --> 12:56.651
Are you afraid of what you might become?

12:58.255 --> 13:01.423
You see, our stories were the same,

13:01.425 --> 13:03.325
up to a point.

13:03.327 --> 13:05.760
But in my realm, Regina's
curse was never cast,

13:05.762 --> 13:07.996
and that's when our tales parted ways,

13:07.998 --> 13:10.532
and that's...

13:10.534 --> 13:13.502
when you found love and happiness.

13:13.504 --> 13:15.804
But I found...

13:15.806 --> 13:18.840
misery and heartbreak.

13:18.842 --> 13:21.877
And cheap rum, apparently.

13:21.879 --> 13:23.378
Now, what do you want from me?

13:23.380 --> 13:26.848
That's the 100-doubloon
question, isn't it?

13:26.850 --> 13:28.316
You see, I always thought

13:28.318 --> 13:30.285
Captain Hook could never find love,

13:30.287 --> 13:35.557
but then, in another
realm, I realized...

13:35.559 --> 13:37.559
you had it.

13:37.561 --> 13:40.161
With Emma Swan.

13:40.163 --> 13:42.998
So I wandered the realms
trying to find her once again.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.900
But where was she?

13:44.902 --> 13:47.068
I couldn't find her?

13:47.070 --> 13:49.237
Then, today...

13:49.239 --> 13:53.598
the answer literally
jumped into my hand.

13:53.601 --> 13:55.810
Help. I've been captured
by Lady Tremaine.

13:55.812 --> 13:56.811
Send Emma...

13:56.813 --> 13:57.946
That's my bottle.

13:57.948 --> 14:01.216
Our bottle.

14:01.218 --> 14:06.254
Its magic sent Henry's
message to both Captain Hooks.

14:06.256 --> 14:07.689
Now...

14:08.945 --> 14:11.660
I know Emma's here, and I
aim to take her from you.

14:11.662 --> 14:14.062
So, tell me... Where is she?

14:14.064 --> 14:16.264
Enough.

14:16.266 --> 14:19.634
I don't owe an answer to a man
soaked in rum and self-pity.

14:19.636 --> 14:21.703
Oh, I may be soaked in self-pity,

14:21.705 --> 14:26.408
but... the truth is...

14:26.410 --> 14:28.677
I haven't touched a
drop of rum for years.

14:46.242 --> 14:48.320
There he is, taking his sweet time.

14:48.323 --> 14:50.162
Now, let's find this Henry Mills.

14:50.164 --> 14:51.697
I'm not doing that.

14:51.699 --> 14:54.266
Why, what's wrong, Detective?
Afraid we're going too far?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.901
I don't think we're going far enough.

14:55.903 --> 14:57.569
We've got a job. Let's do it.

14:57.571 --> 14:58.937
I have a way of getting it done now.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.505
Ooh, does someone have a dark side?

15:00.507 --> 15:02.240
I'm not the man you think I am.

15:12.352 --> 15:14.953
Well, I heard you were in this realm.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.923
I had to see for meself.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.395
After what you did to me, Captain,

15:23.397 --> 15:26.498
you're lucky you have eyes
left to see anything at all.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.827
Now, tell me what you want,

15:27.830 --> 15:30.268
before I give you a second hook, Hook.

15:30.270 --> 15:31.837
Well...

15:31.839 --> 15:33.138
you're not gonna hurt me...

15:33.140 --> 15:37.142
Not when I can help you with
a problem like Henry Mills.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.443
I can make him go home,

15:38.445 --> 15:41.001
and we can both get what we want.

15:41.004 --> 15:42.670
And what is it you want?

15:42.673 --> 15:43.639
A woman.

15:45.018 --> 15:46.518
Named Emma Swan.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.987
What makes you think this Emma Swan

15:48.989 --> 15:51.723
would possibly love you,
when no one else would?

15:51.725 --> 15:53.191
Because she's already fallen in love

15:53.193 --> 15:57.162
with another Captain
Hook... From another realm.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.965
Now, that Captain Hook
is dying of thirst,

15:59.967 --> 16:02.234
tied under a cart in a filthy alley.

16:02.236 --> 16:05.871
Now, I managed to get...

16:05.873 --> 16:08.640
a little bit of fresh
blood before I left him.

16:08.642 --> 16:11.810
And I want you to make me like him.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.981
You forget... I don't wield magic.

16:15.983 --> 16:20.619
Well, you always had a talent
for acquiring... things.

16:20.621 --> 16:21.720
Hm?

16:23.423 --> 16:24.990
Well, now.

16:26.827 --> 16:31.363
I did recently acquire
this little number

16:31.365 --> 16:32.998
from a fairy godmother.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.266
Mm.

16:34.268 --> 16:36.802
Bad luck for her.

16:36.804 --> 16:38.018
Good luck for me.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.573
And you.

16:41.575 --> 16:43.041
We have a deal.

17:00.861 --> 17:04.762
How would you like to build a
house out of reclaimed straw?

17:04.765 --> 17:06.932
This app sucks. I'm
just wasting your time.

17:06.934 --> 17:08.934
It's okay. You did the best you could.

17:08.935 --> 17:09.968
Wait, wait, wait.

17:09.970 --> 17:12.170
You must have a fairy
godmother somewhere,

17:12.172 --> 17:14.888
because the perfect job just got posted.

17:14.892 --> 17:16.174
A catering gig.

17:19.445 --> 17:21.213
At the ballet.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.949
Thanks so much for
coming on short notice.

17:23.951 --> 17:25.784
These last-minute
events are gonna kill me.

17:25.786 --> 17:28.420
Uh, you do both have
catering experience, right?

17:28.422 --> 17:29.421
- Of course.
- Tons.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.189
Great. Here's the new bartender.

17:31.191 --> 17:32.657
He'll set you up.

17:33.703 --> 17:34.793
Hey, there.

17:34.795 --> 17:36.561
What the hell are you doing here?

17:36.563 --> 17:38.063
I'm just trying to help.

17:38.066 --> 17:40.432
Look, I used to work a lot of
serving gigs, so I came here,

17:40.434 --> 17:42.033
I convinced a really nervous caterer

17:42.035 --> 17:43.368
that he needed a second bar.

17:43.370 --> 17:46.204
And let me guess... you
generously offered to bartend.

17:46.206 --> 17:48.373
As long as he let me hire the servers.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.476
Wow. That is a weirdly impressive move.

17:51.478 --> 17:54.746
I feel terrible for separating you two.

17:54.748 --> 17:57.315
I'm just trying to make up for it.

17:57.317 --> 18:00.352
Hey, look, after tonight, you
never have to see me again.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.692
How do you like my search warrant?

18:07.694 --> 18:09.661
Not a bad start.

18:09.663 --> 18:11.830
Let's see how you go on.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.840
Nothing.

18:21.842 --> 18:23.608
Zero dirt on this guy.

18:25.178 --> 18:27.946
Use your eyes, not your hands.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.750
And look at what you missed.

18:35.822 --> 18:37.122
It's a girl.

18:37.124 --> 18:38.690
I'd say this man had a daughter,

18:38.692 --> 18:41.326
doesn't live here
now, probably divorced.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.996
Either way, it's hardly dirt.

18:44.998 --> 18:48.199
Don't be so literal.

18:48.201 --> 18:52.370
We're here to find
points of vulnerability.

18:52.372 --> 18:55.573
And a daughter...
That's the grand prize.

18:57.524 --> 19:01.112
Unless that somehow
bothers you, because, uh...

19:01.114 --> 19:02.580
seeing as how, uh...

19:05.352 --> 19:07.218
you've been here before...

19:09.923 --> 19:14.392
I need you to be either
a, uh, good detective,

19:14.394 --> 19:16.861
or extremely loyal to me.

19:16.863 --> 19:20.899
And at this point, I'm pinning
all my hopes on "Loyal."

19:20.901 --> 19:26.438
Now, you can see why I would
be concerned if you lie to me.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.540
Are you loyal?

19:28.542 --> 19:29.541
Try me.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.076
Oh, I will.

19:31.078 --> 19:32.544
I most certainly will.

19:39.727 --> 19:42.495
Oh, hey. Look who it is.

19:43.831 --> 19:46.165
Mom, you're here! I knew you'd make it!

19:46.167 --> 19:48.267
Of course. I wouldn't miss this.

19:48.269 --> 19:49.867
And Henry... Did he help you get in?

19:50.938 --> 19:52.204
He did.

19:52.206 --> 19:54.974
I knew it! I knew he'd
believe! It's all happening!

19:57.578 --> 19:59.078
Are you in love with her?

19:59.080 --> 20:02.148
Am... Uh, wha... Am I in... Uh...

20:02.150 --> 20:04.583
Hardly.

20:04.585 --> 20:06.619
I j... I just met her.

20:06.621 --> 20:08.521
So, I'm just a guy who screwed up,

20:08.523 --> 20:11.023
and I'm trying to fix it.

20:11.025 --> 20:12.958
Yeah. Looks like a start, anyway.

20:14.984 --> 20:16.250
I got to go warm up,

20:16.253 --> 20:19.031
but I'll look at you from
the stage, so look close!

20:19.033 --> 20:20.299
He's here.

20:20.301 --> 20:23.569
Get him out of my life now.

20:23.571 --> 20:25.071
Understood.

20:27.575 --> 20:30.543
Come. The lady beckons.

20:50.465 --> 20:53.165
So, tell me about home.
How is it back there?

20:55.085 --> 20:57.952
Well, Granny's added poke.

20:57.955 --> 20:59.905
Archie's seen business go down

20:59.907 --> 21:03.576
because of all the...
well, happy endings.

21:03.578 --> 21:05.978
But on the flip side,

21:05.980 --> 21:08.080
his wedding officiating has gone way up.

21:11.018 --> 21:12.651
My family? Grandma, Grandpa?

21:12.653 --> 21:15.821
As you can imagine, sickeningly happy.

21:16.990 --> 21:19.524
You left out one person...

21:19.527 --> 21:21.560
You.

21:21.562 --> 21:24.530
How are you, Mom?

21:24.532 --> 21:26.165
I'm... I'm fine.

21:26.167 --> 21:27.366
Mom.

21:27.368 --> 21:28.501
I miss you.

21:28.503 --> 21:30.169
I know.

21:30.171 --> 21:31.904
I miss you, too. I do.

21:33.654 --> 21:35.407
And Emma... Everything's good with her?

21:35.409 --> 21:37.409
Mm.

21:37.411 --> 21:39.311
What? Is something going on with her?

21:39.313 --> 21:41.480
No. She's... She's fine.

21:41.482 --> 21:42.748
Enough about us.

21:42.750 --> 21:46.919
I want to hear more about
you, about your story.

21:46.921 --> 21:49.688
It appears it's been interesting?

21:50.725 --> 21:52.858
Yeah.

21:52.860 --> 21:54.994
Yeah, I guess.

21:54.996 --> 21:57.329
Although, I wouldn't mind
a little less interesting.

21:57.331 --> 21:59.064
Hmm.

21:59.066 --> 22:00.933
Cinderella might not even like me.

22:00.935 --> 22:02.434
I mean, if I was running for my life,

22:02.436 --> 22:05.771
I'd probably ditch the glass heels, too.

22:05.773 --> 22:07.540
I just...

22:07.542 --> 22:09.375
I have no idea what she thinks of me.

22:09.377 --> 22:12.311
Actually, I do.

22:12.313 --> 22:14.246
And it's... it's...

22:14.248 --> 22:16.448
I-it's not good.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.350
What? What... What happened?

22:18.352 --> 22:20.586
I came across some pirates
who crossed paths with her.

22:20.588 --> 22:23.789
She bought passage on a
ship for the next morning.

22:23.791 --> 22:26.792
I caught her before she weighed anchor.

22:26.794 --> 22:28.594
She wrote this on the spot.

22:38.005 --> 22:39.872
Yeah.

22:39.874 --> 22:41.707
Then she set sail.

22:41.709 --> 22:45.311
I really think it's
time we... head home.

22:47.348 --> 22:49.348
Uh...

22:49.350 --> 22:51.617
yeah.

22:51.619 --> 22:53.519
Yeah, it is.

22:53.521 --> 22:55.521
This trip was an absolute failure.

22:55.523 --> 22:57.823
- Henry...
- No, no. It's... It's okay. It's okay.

22:57.825 --> 22:59.625
It's... It's a failure.

22:59.627 --> 23:01.927
You are not a failure, Henry.

23:01.929 --> 23:04.230
Well...

23:04.232 --> 23:07.132
Right. Uh, thanks, Mom.

23:10.238 --> 23:13.439
Go give him one of your
piratey heart-to-hearts.

23:13.441 --> 23:15.841
Make him feel better.

23:15.843 --> 23:17.776
Go!

23:17.778 --> 23:18.911
Aye.

23:23.918 --> 23:25.391
Sorry about the lass.

23:25.394 --> 23:26.552
Thanks.

23:26.554 --> 23:29.221
It's, uh... it's gonna take a while.

23:31.125 --> 23:32.579
But before we even...

23:34.108 --> 23:35.728
Is everything really all right at home?

23:35.730 --> 23:37.830
What's going on with Emma? Is she okay?

23:37.832 --> 23:40.099
Uh, well, you know, a Savior...

23:41.168 --> 23:44.603
Um... ticklish, tall.

23:44.605 --> 23:46.171
You don't seem like yourself.

23:46.173 --> 23:48.374
What's the matter with you?

23:48.376 --> 23:50.776
I'll tell you what...
Let's... Let's just go home.

23:54.515 --> 23:55.914
Tell me Mom's okay.

23:55.916 --> 23:58.617
Well, u-umm...

23:58.619 --> 24:01.086
She...

24:01.088 --> 24:02.988
is...

24:02.990 --> 24:04.523
o... kay.

24:04.525 --> 24:05.758
Tell me.

24:05.760 --> 24:08.594
Last I checked, I'm fine.

24:08.596 --> 24:10.329
Mom!

24:10.331 --> 24:11.864
Oh, my God. Look at you!

24:13.234 --> 24:14.733
I know, I know. It's been a while.

24:14.735 --> 24:16.201
I've missed you, kid.

24:16.203 --> 24:17.770
Me too. I thought something was wrong.

24:17.772 --> 24:20.039
No, it's... it's
nothing like that at all.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.074
I'm... I'm fine. It's just,
Killian wanted me to rest,

24:22.076 --> 24:23.175
but I couldn't wait any longer.

24:23.177 --> 24:24.443
I had to make sure you were both okay.

24:24.445 --> 24:28.547
And I just... I wanted
to tell you myself.

24:28.549 --> 24:29.915
Tell me what?

24:31.285 --> 24:32.751
I'm pregnant.

24:41.357 --> 24:43.325
- You're gonna be great!
- I hope so, kid.

24:43.328 --> 24:45.667
I mean, neither of us have done
the diapers-and-the-feedings thing.

24:45.669 --> 24:47.217
It's what I missed with you.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.785
Mom, you did okay with me.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.887
I know, but, you know, it
just... it took a long time

24:50.889 --> 24:54.991
to find each other and
find ourselves, and...

24:54.993 --> 24:57.394
Now, we both made mistakes,
and we both can learn from them,

24:57.396 --> 25:00.976
and we both can do something
good from the start.

25:02.968 --> 25:04.401
I've always tried to do good.

25:04.403 --> 25:05.802
Killian?

25:08.540 --> 25:10.740
I've... done something.

25:10.742 --> 25:13.009
I...

25:13.011 --> 25:14.310
I have to fix it.

25:16.615 --> 25:17.614
Killian?

25:24.556 --> 25:27.157
I don't care what you do.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.324
Frame him or something.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.526
If you'll permit me...

25:31.897 --> 25:33.263
It's like a riddle.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.666
What fits in your pocket but
pays the rent for a decade?

25:36.668 --> 25:38.001
Just put him away.

25:40.494 --> 25:42.672
So, you're gonna put
that in his pocket here?

25:42.674 --> 25:44.641
No, no, not me.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.776
You.

25:46.778 --> 25:50.413
You told me you're not
the man I think you are.

25:50.415 --> 25:52.849
So...

25:52.851 --> 25:54.184
let's see who you are.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.148
Where are you?!

26:59.150 --> 27:01.784
We have to talk!

27:01.786 --> 27:03.753
Talk? More like "Finish me off."

27:05.336 --> 27:06.489
No.

27:06.491 --> 27:07.594
Wait!

27:15.133 --> 27:16.833
You tried to finish me off.

27:16.835 --> 27:18.668
Well, it looks like you
finished yourself off.

27:22.243 --> 27:24.974
I didn't come here to kill you.
I came here to set you free.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.376
Aye?

27:26.378 --> 27:28.011
And why would you do that?

27:28.013 --> 27:29.779
And when did you get so young?

27:29.781 --> 27:31.180
I was gonna take your place.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.283
Oh, you are a bastard.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.261
But Emma...

27:35.264 --> 27:36.296
she's here.

27:36.299 --> 27:37.265
Is she okay?

27:37.268 --> 27:38.604
Yeah, she's fine.

27:39.642 --> 27:41.842
And yes, I know...
You're to be a father.

27:41.845 --> 27:43.459
And I couldn't... I...

27:43.461 --> 27:46.070
I wouldn't get between
a father and his child.

27:46.073 --> 27:47.906
What kind of deception is this?

27:47.909 --> 27:49.566
Because a child...

27:49.568 --> 27:52.468
That's why'm doing all
this in this first place.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.404
I'm trying to find my daughter.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.183
Whoo!

28:14.359 --> 28:16.693
What a delightful performance.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.561
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.063
If I can have your attention, please.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.465
My name is Detective Weaver.

28:22.467 --> 28:24.500
At some point during this event,

28:24.502 --> 28:27.070
Ms. Belfrey's bracelet
has come up missing.

28:27.072 --> 28:30.535
I'd like to ask all paying
guests to please remain seated.

28:30.538 --> 28:32.809
Event employees, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you

28:32.811 --> 28:36.512
to consent to a quick,
non-invasive search.

28:36.514 --> 28:39.749
Wait. You're just looking at us?

28:39.751 --> 28:41.718
Step back. You have been warned.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.952
Hey! Leave her alone!

28:42.954 --> 28:44.420
Unh!

28:44.422 --> 28:46.422
Do not touch a peace officer.

28:49.327 --> 28:52.161
In fact, turn out your pockets.

28:53.498 --> 28:55.498
Are you listening to me?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.066
Turn out your pockets.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.002
Okay!

29:03.475 --> 29:05.508
Oh, w...

29:05.510 --> 29:07.076
Well, I have no idea how...

29:13.018 --> 29:14.283
This is my key chain.

29:20.158 --> 29:22.706
Stay awake till Emma gets here.

29:22.709 --> 29:24.325
Tell me about your daughter.

29:24.328 --> 29:27.597
A vengeful witch
trapped her in a prison.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.432
Every day, I'd sneak in

29:29.434 --> 29:31.768
to play chess with her.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.603
But I was discovered...

29:34.906 --> 29:36.730
and punished.

29:36.733 --> 29:39.208
My heart was poisoned...

29:39.210 --> 29:41.438
cursed.

29:41.441 --> 29:44.242
So I can never...

29:44.245 --> 29:45.748
save her.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.119
I knew...

29:50.121 --> 29:52.889
I knew that true love was the cure.

29:52.891 --> 29:54.957
So I roamed the realms seeking it,

29:54.959 --> 29:57.293
but it was futile.

29:57.295 --> 30:00.096
Then, I thought, maybe Emma...

30:00.098 --> 30:01.698
Killian?

30:01.700 --> 30:02.732
Who's that?

30:02.734 --> 30:04.701
He's hurt. Please help him.

30:04.703 --> 30:07.503
It's me... from the wish
realm, magically aged down.

30:07.505 --> 30:10.206
Please save him. He
deserves his second chance.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.275
It's too late for me.

30:14.379 --> 30:15.712
Here.

30:15.847 --> 30:17.113
Here.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.118
This was hers.

30:22.135 --> 30:24.602
I kept it to remember her.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.124
It's her rook.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.793
She has my knight.

30:30.795 --> 30:32.061
Find her.

30:33.431 --> 30:34.931
Give that to her.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.204
Emma.

30:41.672 --> 30:45.340
I'm sorry. I don't think my
magic works in this realm.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.376
If it were me, you'd find a way.

30:47.378 --> 30:49.979
Find the part in him...
The part that's me.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.319
Hey. Killian.

30:56.321 --> 30:58.955
You don't know me, but I know you.

31:00.925 --> 31:02.892
The man I fell in love with..

31:05.430 --> 31:09.031
Until we met, he was you.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.033
Which means there's hope.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.202
All you need to do is believe.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.438
Hey. Hey, just look at me...

31:17.709 --> 31:18.875
and believe.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.959
Thank you.

31:43.605 --> 31:46.129
No, no, no. Let's not do that.

31:48.477 --> 31:51.077
Thought you'd taken this for the money.

31:51.079 --> 31:53.179
And yet, here we are.

31:53.181 --> 31:55.448
He's an innocent man.

31:55.450 --> 31:56.750
One who lost a daughter.

31:56.752 --> 31:58.785
I couldn't do it to him.

31:58.787 --> 32:03.223
So, am I just out of a partner,
or am I out of a job, too?

32:03.225 --> 32:05.692
You asked me why I chose you.

32:05.694 --> 32:07.560
'Cause you wanted it so damn much.

32:07.562 --> 32:09.529
I thought you'd do just
about anything to keep it,

32:09.531 --> 32:11.766
cross any line.

32:11.769 --> 32:13.802
Then I caught a glimpse of something,

32:13.805 --> 32:16.870
something in you I
thought was extinct...

32:16.872 --> 32:19.306
A moral core.

32:19.308 --> 32:22.809
And that, believe it or not,

32:22.811 --> 32:24.444
is exactly what I wanted.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.515
Don't worry about this.

32:28.517 --> 32:30.250
I'll put it back where it belongs.

32:32.321 --> 32:34.020
Impressive.

32:34.022 --> 32:37.924
Not only did you fail at
the special task I gave you,

32:37.926 --> 32:40.460
you couldn't even pull
off basic police work.

32:40.462 --> 32:43.563
Ms. Belfrey, you do not employ me,

32:43.565 --> 32:45.498
you do not own me,

32:45.500 --> 32:48.168
and you most certainly don't control me.

32:48.170 --> 32:51.004
Up until now, our goals have aligned.

32:51.006 --> 32:52.505
They may not always.

32:59.910 --> 33:01.102
Hey.

33:05.022 --> 33:08.423
Lucy's thing about me being Cinderella?

33:08.426 --> 33:11.858
It kills me that she sees me that way.

33:11.860 --> 33:14.027
So, you getting me the job tonight

33:14.029 --> 33:16.596
was way too...

33:16.598 --> 33:18.798
"Someday, my prince will come."

33:18.800 --> 33:22.102
I think that's Snow White, but...

33:22.104 --> 33:25.805
But without you, I
wouldn't have seen Lucy.

33:25.807 --> 33:28.308
And then, you took an elbow to the head,

33:28.310 --> 33:29.836
which was amazing.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.444
Mm.

33:31.446 --> 33:34.014
So, um, you add it all up, and...

33:34.016 --> 33:37.250
And you'll... accept my apology?

33:39.254 --> 33:41.888
You earned a second chance.

33:41.890 --> 33:42.989
Thank you.

33:44.593 --> 33:46.026
Thank you.

33:46.028 --> 33:48.661
Want to pull up a stool?

33:48.663 --> 33:51.431
I picked up a... A late shift.

33:51.433 --> 33:53.733
I'm sorry.

33:53.735 --> 33:55.168
Enjoy the beer.

34:02.611 --> 34:05.512
So, you're good... You and Hook?

34:05.514 --> 34:07.480
Yeah. Great.

34:07.482 --> 34:10.952
We're... a family, almost.

34:10.955 --> 34:12.118
I had to go.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.585
I know.

34:13.588 --> 34:15.688
I didn't always like it, but I know.

34:15.690 --> 34:19.192
So... you're not here to drag me back?

34:19.194 --> 34:20.293
Do you want to come back?

34:20.295 --> 34:23.429
I...

34:23.431 --> 34:25.031
I do.

34:25.033 --> 34:27.967
I do want to.

34:27.969 --> 34:29.668
But...

34:29.670 --> 34:31.971
I still haven't found my story.

34:31.973 --> 34:34.774
Or... well, maybe I did, but
I still have to fight for it.

34:34.775 --> 34:36.842
Yeah.

34:36.844 --> 34:38.143
I know that feeling.

34:38.146 --> 34:40.447
I can't give up.

34:40.449 --> 34:42.916
And, I mean, it all
could be for nothing.

34:42.918 --> 34:44.918
Who knows if she left the slipper for me

34:44.920 --> 34:46.853
or if it just fell off.

34:48.956 --> 34:52.025
You're not allowed to come
home until you find your answer.

34:52.027 --> 34:53.860
So, you're okay with me staying?

34:53.862 --> 34:55.661
I'm your mom.

34:55.664 --> 34:58.998
I'm never gonna be
okay with being apart.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
But all those years
ago, when you were a kid

35:01.002 --> 35:03.169
and you found me and you
brought me to Storybrooke

35:03.171 --> 35:06.172
and brought me to my family...

35:06.174 --> 35:09.008
I'm gonna keep missing
the hell out of you.

35:09.010 --> 35:11.010
But I got to give you what you gave me.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.448
We are gonna miss you, m'boy.

35:17.819 --> 35:19.486
Aye.

35:19.488 --> 35:21.988
Never give up on love, Henry.

35:21.990 --> 35:24.457
I wasted many years trying
to steal another man's love,

35:24.459 --> 35:26.226
and, uh...

35:26.228 --> 35:28.761
now it's time for me
to find one of my own...

35:28.763 --> 35:30.864
My daughter.

35:30.866 --> 35:32.232
And I will.

35:32.234 --> 35:35.068
I don't doubt it.

35:35.070 --> 35:37.170
When you do...

35:37.172 --> 35:38.538
give her this.

35:42.043 --> 35:43.443
Thank you.

35:43.445 --> 35:46.012
I just wish I knew the
first steps to take.

35:46.014 --> 35:47.514
Yeah.

35:47.516 --> 35:48.615
Me too.

35:48.617 --> 35:50.389
Team up.

35:50.392 --> 35:51.488
What?

35:51.491 --> 35:52.652
You need Henry.

35:52.654 --> 35:54.554
You made the wrong choices,
but for the right reasons,

35:54.556 --> 35:57.394
and Henry always knows
the right things to do.

35:57.397 --> 35:59.159
And I think I'd feel better knowing that

35:59.161 --> 36:01.661
some sort of Killian
was looking out for him.

36:03.565 --> 36:05.632
I'm in if you are.

36:05.634 --> 36:06.666
All right.

36:09.704 --> 36:11.371
Someone better go get Regina.

36:11.373 --> 36:13.206
Storybrooke awaits.

36:15.410 --> 36:18.111
Are you sure you won't come with us?

36:18.113 --> 36:20.313
I'll be back.

36:20.315 --> 36:22.182
I know. I just...

36:22.184 --> 36:24.350
I hate being apart.

36:27.756 --> 36:29.522
Why don't...

36:29.524 --> 36:31.524
Why don't you come with us?

36:31.526 --> 36:34.761
With you and... Other Hook?

36:34.763 --> 36:36.963
Why not? Look, your story's not over.

36:38.567 --> 36:40.166
Maybe you need to be here to find it.

36:41.536 --> 36:43.303
And...

36:43.305 --> 36:44.871
Maybe I need you here, too.

36:51.479 --> 36:54.614
Well, can this be one of...

36:54.616 --> 36:56.449
your "operations"?

36:58.753 --> 37:03.289
How about "Operation: Next Chapter"?

37:03.291 --> 37:04.791
Hmm.

37:04.793 --> 37:06.659
Let's go say goodbye.

37:12.601 --> 37:13.866
I love you, kid.

37:13.868 --> 37:15.168
I love you, too, Mom.

37:20.208 --> 37:22.375
Best of luck, m'boy.

38:12.526 --> 38:14.926
Hey.

38:14.929 --> 38:16.562
What's this?

38:16.564 --> 38:17.797
Addresses.

38:17.799 --> 38:20.078
A list of all the cemeteries in Seattle.

38:20.081 --> 38:21.934
I couldn't find the names
that you were looking for,

38:21.936 --> 38:24.337
so I thought that might be a
good place for you to start.

38:28.343 --> 38:32.345
You know, I sure was
happy to find this tonight.

38:34.115 --> 38:36.115
Funny thing... I took the bus.

38:36.117 --> 38:39.619
I could've swore I left it at home.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.509
I always liked swans.

38:41.512 --> 38:43.122
That's why I named her "Emma Swan"...

38:43.124 --> 38:45.510
The woman from the book.

38:45.513 --> 38:47.193
She's the mother of the main character,

38:47.195 --> 38:49.696
and I guess I wrote
the mother I wanted...

38:49.698 --> 38:50.863
A hero.

38:50.865 --> 38:52.799
The illustration...
You drew that, right?

38:52.801 --> 38:54.801
Mm-hmm.

38:54.803 --> 38:56.491
My first year on the job,

38:56.494 --> 38:59.505
I was trying to find a missing girl.

38:59.507 --> 39:02.308
Searching for her, I
went down the wrong alley,

39:02.310 --> 39:03.509
and I got shot.

39:05.480 --> 39:08.022
Uh, I didn't see who it was.

39:08.025 --> 39:11.026
And then this...

39:11.029 --> 39:12.851
woman came from nowhere.

39:12.854 --> 39:14.187
She placed her hand on my wound,

39:14.189 --> 39:16.756
and she told me to look her in the eye,

39:16.758 --> 39:22.261
said, uh, "If you believe
in me, this will work."

39:22.263 --> 39:25.031
She kept me alive until
the ambulance arrived.

39:26.968 --> 39:28.601
The woman from your book.

39:28.603 --> 39:32.105
Now, I didn't see her again.

39:32.107 --> 39:36.509
But she gave me a second
chance, and I vowed to use it

39:36.511 --> 39:39.212
to find that poor little missing girl.

39:39.214 --> 39:41.197
I became desperate to succeed...

39:41.200 --> 39:43.850
So desperate..

39:43.852 --> 39:45.785
That I almost lost myself.

39:46.955 --> 39:49.489
Doesn't seem like you have.

39:49.491 --> 39:53.726
Because of that woman... From your book.

39:53.728 --> 39:58.231
She reminded me that I had
to do things the right way,

39:58.233 --> 40:01.934
that I had to be a hero, like she was.

40:01.936 --> 40:04.871
Looking for that girl, it's
been nothing but dead ends.

40:04.873 --> 40:07.507
It's like someone
doesn't want her found,

40:07.509 --> 40:09.175
someone with a lot of pull in this town.

40:09.177 --> 40:11.577
And after today,

40:11.579 --> 40:14.247
I might have an idea who that is.

40:17.419 --> 40:18.718
Roni's okay.

40:21.556 --> 40:23.556
I have a feeling that
all of our problems

40:23.558 --> 40:25.892
all have the same name.

40:25.894 --> 40:27.660
And that name is Victoria Belfrey.

40:28.863 --> 40:31.264
So, what are you thinking, Detective?

40:31.266 --> 40:33.032
I'm thinking that she's dirty

40:33.034 --> 40:35.902
in a way that we don't understand yet.

40:35.904 --> 40:38.171
And now that I'm a detective,

40:38.173 --> 40:41.474
I can dig into things
I never could before...

40:41.476 --> 40:44.310
Maybe find out what it is she's up to.

40:44.312 --> 40:47.051
And if, maybe, someone could
point me in the direction

40:47.054 --> 40:48.887
of people who are
being squeezed by her...

40:50.385 --> 40:52.285
and if somebody could write about it

40:52.287 --> 40:55.021
and release it when it's ready...

40:55.023 --> 40:57.523
if we do this...

40:57.525 --> 41:02.361
then maybe someday, I can
find that missing girl.

41:02.363 --> 41:03.596
Huh.

41:03.598 --> 41:06.332
Almost sounds like
there's enough for a book.

41:06.334 --> 41:07.667
Possibly two.

41:09.003 --> 41:10.203
You in?

41:10.205 --> 41:12.505
Oh, yeah.

41:12.507 --> 41:13.706
Are you ready?

41:13.708 --> 41:14.807
Aye.

41:16.311 --> 41:19.378
Let's get to work.
