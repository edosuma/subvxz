01:07.430 --> 01:08.786
In a shocking turn of events,

01:08.811 --> 01:10.380
Sierra Macy, thought
to have been murdered...

01:10.405 --> 01:12.912
Lazy morning in bed with
your new girlfriend Naomi?

01:12.937 --> 01:15.687
No, we're both a little busy
what with the U.S. Attorney

01:15.712 --> 01:17.578
going through every case
I've ever worked.

01:17.614 --> 01:19.080
You said you were 10 blocks away.

01:19.115 --> 01:20.124
Traffic on Broadway.

01:20.149 --> 01:21.937
You also said
I got to pick my own cases.

01:21.962 --> 01:23.194
Believe me, you'll pick this one.

01:23.219 --> 01:25.085
You see the news this morning
about Sierra Macy?

01:25.121 --> 01:27.488
Woman from Queens,
went missing a decade ago.

01:27.524 --> 01:28.856
Presumed dead until today

01:28.892 --> 01:30.991
when she flagged down
a UPS driver in Yonkers.

01:31.026 --> 01:33.092
- A miracle.
- If it's really her.

01:33.128 --> 01:34.238
Prints are a match. It's her.

01:34.263 --> 01:36.909
I've had my share of lost weekends,
but 10 years? Where's she been?

01:36.934 --> 01:40.299
Apparently held captive by a long-haul
trucker named Peter Gunther.

01:40.335 --> 01:42.368
He died of a heart attack,
Sierra escaped.

01:42.404 --> 01:44.337
You want CIU to review
the conviction of the guy

01:44.372 --> 01:46.272
currently in prison
for her kidnap and murder.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.007
Josh Fleck.
He was a teacher at her school.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.342
He should go free.
Clearly, he didn't kill Sierra.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.110
But Peter Gunther didn't abduct her.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.446
NYPD found his trip sheets in the house.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.516
He was doing a long haul in Iowa
the night she went missing.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.592
Gunther had an accomplice.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.986
Could've been Josh Fleck
or someone else entirely.

02:01.022 --> 02:02.988
How solid is the case against Fleck?

02:03.032 --> 02:04.599
Physical evidence
connects him to the crime,

02:04.624 --> 02:06.490
he lied to the cops, and pled guilty.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.826
Could mean he's guilty,
could mean some bulldog prosecutor

02:08.851 --> 02:11.495
railroaded an innocent guy
into a plea deal.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.398
Is it really her?

02:14.434 --> 02:17.201
- Is Sierra alive?
- Yeah.

02:17.236 --> 02:20.371
Hayes, meet the bulldog
who put Josh Fleck away.

02:30.082 --> 02:32.215
Sierra Macy was a junior
at Westford High

02:32.250 --> 02:33.183
when she disappeared.

02:33.218 --> 02:35.552
She had a reputation
for breaking the rules...

02:35.588 --> 02:37.653
skipping class, smoking pot,
running away from home.

02:37.689 --> 02:39.254
Girl after my own heart.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.423
Josh Fleck started teaching
at Westford that year.

02:41.459 --> 02:44.595
He was 23, known as
the cool teacher, offering advice,

02:44.629 --> 02:46.395
taking an interest
in students' personal lives...

02:46.430 --> 02:47.529
Maybe too personal an interest.

02:47.565 --> 02:49.331
Sierra called Josh from
a train station that night,

02:49.366 --> 02:51.500
which he denied when the cops
first contacted him.

02:51.535 --> 02:53.569
You shouldn't be here.

02:53.605 --> 02:55.003
I'm still a part of this unit.

02:55.038 --> 02:57.238
Turns out Josh was lying.

02:57.273 --> 02:58.940
He picked up Sierra
and drove her to a nearby diner.

02:58.976 --> 03:00.441
You put this guy away, though.

03:00.477 --> 03:02.210
Which means I know this case
inside and out.

03:02.245 --> 03:03.712
And since we only have five days...

03:03.747 --> 03:05.413
A waitress served them
around 10:00 p.m.,

03:05.448 --> 03:08.282
and a half-hour later, she said she
saw Sierra getting into Josh's truck.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.351
There's no way you can be
objective about this.

03:10.386 --> 03:12.586
- You should recuse yourself.
- Thanks for the support.

03:12.622 --> 03:14.254
Or you should do it for him.

03:14.289 --> 03:17.091
Maxine's right, according
to conventional wisdom.

03:17.126 --> 03:20.127
I hate conventional wisdom.
Sam's familiar with the case.

03:20.162 --> 03:21.595
And I want to see how he handles

03:21.631 --> 03:23.396
the anguish of facing his mistake.

03:23.432 --> 03:25.733
It's not a problem if I made a mistake.

03:25.768 --> 03:28.035
Sierra Macy's alive,
and since you got Josh

03:28.070 --> 03:29.435
to plead guilty
to her kidnap and murder...

03:29.470 --> 03:31.037
Because Detective Quinn
and I put together

03:31.072 --> 03:32.271
an airtight case against him.

03:32.306 --> 03:34.540
We had Sierra's blood on the
passenger door of Josh's truck

03:34.575 --> 03:36.142
and a shovel
with fresh dirt in the back.

03:36.177 --> 03:37.710
Which he obviously didn't use
to bury her.

03:37.746 --> 03:41.280
The point is even without a body,
I had enough for a life sentence.

03:41.315 --> 03:43.116
This time, just get the truth.

03:43.151 --> 03:45.284
You can start by reinterviewing Josh.

03:45.319 --> 03:47.318
I wasn't kidding
about facing your mistakes.

03:47.354 --> 03:49.955
Maxine, go with him,
make sure he stays objective.

03:49.990 --> 03:53.158
Frankie, see if you can find
a link between Josh and Gunther.

03:53.193 --> 03:55.127
Tess, reach out to Sierra's mom,

03:55.162 --> 03:58.263
see if Sierra's up for talking to us.

04:07.140 --> 04:09.640
How have the last 10 years
been for you, A.D.A. Spencer?

04:09.676 --> 04:12.643
'Cause mine have really sucked.

04:12.679 --> 04:14.065
When am I getting out of here?

04:14.090 --> 04:15.479
Your murder conviction's
being overturned,

04:15.514 --> 04:16.981
but the kidnapping still stands.

04:17.016 --> 04:18.649
We'll be adding trafficking charges

04:18.685 --> 04:21.284
if we prove you were
responsible for her abduction.

04:21.319 --> 04:22.786
So this time you'll prove it

04:22.821 --> 04:24.487
instead of bullying me into a plea?

04:24.522 --> 04:26.355
If you were innocent, why take the deal?

04:26.391 --> 04:30.026
My lawyer told me a jury
might give me a life sentence.

04:30.062 --> 04:33.496
Figured 20 years, I'm 43 when I get out.

04:33.531 --> 04:36.132
I still have a shot at a life.

04:36.168 --> 04:38.600
Tell us what happened
the night Sierra disappeared.

04:38.635 --> 04:40.678
I've already told him plenty of times.

04:40.703 --> 04:42.428
Tell me.

04:42.453 --> 04:44.173
Taking a plea means
you give up your appeals.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.675
This review's your only shot
of getting out of here.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.380
Sierra called me from the train station,

04:52.416 --> 04:56.050
said she was running away,
she wanted to say goodbye,

04:56.086 --> 04:59.353
which is teenage speak
for "Stop me, please."

04:59.388 --> 05:00.688
So I picked her up,

05:00.724 --> 05:03.390
took her to the diner
where we could talk.

05:03.426 --> 05:05.359
Sounds like you two were really close.

05:05.394 --> 05:08.362
School was hard for her. Home, too.

05:08.397 --> 05:12.799
Being a teenager, your life
is like wall-to-wall rules.

05:12.835 --> 05:16.302
Sierra needed somebody who could
understand how she felt,

05:16.338 --> 05:18.739
who could tell her it gets better.

05:18.774 --> 05:20.340
You were her teacher, not her friend.

05:20.375 --> 05:23.210
I was trying to do both.

05:23.245 --> 05:25.545
Not the best judgment, I know.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.714
So at the diner, I calmed her down,

05:28.750 --> 05:30.816
or at least I thought I did.

05:30.852 --> 05:34.720
She got up to use the bathroom,
and she never came back.

05:34.756 --> 05:37.656
I figured she needed more time.

05:37.691 --> 05:39.391
It is a nice story,

05:39.426 --> 05:42.394
but it leaves out one little detail...

05:42.429 --> 05:45.630
her blood on the door of your truck.

05:47.768 --> 05:49.600
Please talk to Sierra.

05:49.636 --> 05:51.569
She will tell you we were friends.

05:51.604 --> 05:54.572
I would never hurt her.

05:54.607 --> 05:57.608
We'll see what she has to say.

05:57.644 --> 05:59.244
You're not serious.

05:59.269 --> 06:01.945
Keeping Sam on the case puts him
in complete conflict of interest.

06:01.981 --> 06:03.613
Great way to discover what he's made of.

06:03.648 --> 06:04.614
Your team, your call,

06:04.649 --> 06:06.884
but it's on you to make sure
he doesn't screw up.

06:06.919 --> 06:08.518
Mm-hmm.

06:08.553 --> 06:09.686
You talk to Sierra Macy yet?

06:09.721 --> 06:10.720
About to head over with Sam.

06:10.756 --> 06:12.822
Any update on the battle
with the U.S. Attorney?

06:12.858 --> 06:14.791
Naomi's there now.

06:14.826 --> 06:15.866
Have they found something?

06:15.895 --> 06:17.527
Nothing for them to find.

06:17.562 --> 06:19.362
Doesn't mean they won't find anything.

06:20.899 --> 06:22.865
Well, let me know
if I can help in any way.

06:22.901 --> 06:24.867
Naomi's got me covered. Thanks.

06:24.903 --> 06:26.702
Hello?

06:33.244 --> 06:35.211
Hayes, what can you tell
about the investigation?

06:35.246 --> 06:37.545
All these reporters remind me of
when Sierra disappeared.

06:37.590 --> 06:38.962
Camped out day and night then, too.

06:38.987 --> 06:41.749
The media loves triumph
almost as much as they love tragedy.

06:41.785 --> 06:43.818
Sierra's story bridges both.
She's the dream girl.

06:49.059 --> 06:52.993
Mrs. Macy, thank you for letting
us speak with Sierra.

06:54.797 --> 06:56.397
I'll go get her.

06:56.432 --> 06:58.732
Actually, we need to talk to her alone.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.667
Last door on the left.

07:07.076 --> 07:08.976
Carla, how are you?

07:10.778 --> 07:11.877
Ah.

07:11.913 --> 07:13.346
I cleaned out her room.

07:13.381 --> 07:15.748
I gave away her clothes.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.783
We had a funeral.

07:17.819 --> 07:20.786
I'm sorry.

07:20.822 --> 07:22.062
Based on the evidence we had...

07:22.090 --> 07:24.590
10 years that monster
had my baby locked up.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.725
The things he did.

07:26.761 --> 07:28.260
The police stopped looking.

07:28.295 --> 07:32.113
I gave up because
you told me she was dead.

07:48.982 --> 07:51.249
He showed me a clip from "GMA."

07:52.418 --> 07:54.518
It was my mom talking about my murder...

07:56.032 --> 07:58.970
so that I'd know
no one was coming for me.

07:59.595 --> 08:02.235
Can you remember anything else?

08:03.634 --> 08:05.626
He called me his baby girl.

08:07.144 --> 08:10.934
I'd hear him coming down the stairs
every night like clockwork.

08:13.438 --> 08:15.838
Then a few nights ago, it stopped.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.250
That's when I knew if I didn't get out,

08:19.275 --> 08:21.103
I was gonna die down there.

08:23.747 --> 08:25.564
I didn't, but...

08:28.161 --> 08:30.093
I feel like this girl did.

08:32.715 --> 08:35.347
I don't even remember being her.

08:37.727 --> 08:39.905
Sierra, you know
that Josh Fleck is in prison

08:39.929 --> 08:41.532
for your kidnapping and murder.

08:42.102 --> 08:43.780
He's been cleared of the murder charges,

08:43.804 --> 08:46.664
but there are still some
questions about your abduction.

08:46.937 --> 08:49.104
We know that Gunther wasn't responsible.

08:50.025 --> 08:52.472
We need to find out
who may have taken you.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.838
Do you really think Mr. Fleck did it?

08:56.812 --> 08:59.413
We don't know.
That's why we're asking you.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.799
I remember fighting with Liam,

09:06.174 --> 09:08.221
my mom's boyfriend, here at home.

09:08.479 --> 09:10.229
Is that why you ran off?

09:11.625 --> 09:13.960
I ended up at the train station.

09:14.385 --> 09:16.714
I wasn't sure who to call.

09:17.665 --> 09:20.210
I knew Mr. Fleck wouldn't yell at me.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.639
So he picked me up

09:22.928 --> 09:25.741
and drove me to the diner,
and... and we just...

09:26.436 --> 09:27.765
talked.

09:28.342 --> 09:31.742
And then... everything gets hazy.

09:32.501 --> 09:34.829
I remember feeling dizzy,

09:35.478 --> 09:38.164
and my mouth was dry
like... like I was high.

09:38.199 --> 09:39.603
Do you think Mr. Fleck drugged you?

09:39.729 --> 09:41.603
I don't think so.

09:42.155 --> 09:44.821
- We were friends.
- Try to remember, Sierra.

09:46.892 --> 09:48.634
I'm sorry.

09:49.561 --> 09:51.175
I can't.

09:55.001 --> 09:58.068
Sierra, those scars on your arms,
did Gunther do that to you?

10:00.633 --> 10:02.250
No.

10:02.547 --> 10:04.461
You used to cut yourself?

10:07.975 --> 10:10.309
Did you cut yourself earlier that night

10:10.334 --> 10:12.147
before you called Josh?

10:13.787 --> 10:14.957
Yes.

10:16.587 --> 10:18.086
I was upset.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.536
Thank you, Sierra.

10:26.201 --> 10:28.397
What's with all the questions
about her cutting?

10:28.675 --> 10:30.832
Another explanation
for how Sierra's blood

10:30.857 --> 10:32.222
was found in Josh's truck.

10:32.602 --> 10:35.722
Looks like your airtight case
has sprung a leak.

10:46.627 --> 10:48.127
_

10:48.244 --> 10:50.311
Sierra was cutting
the night she disappeared.

10:50.340 --> 10:53.573
That could be how her blood
got on the door of Josh's truck.

10:53.608 --> 10:55.614
Even if that is the case,
Josh could've kidnapped Sierra

10:55.639 --> 10:57.028
and delivered her to Gunther.

10:57.053 --> 10:58.445
He didn't have an alibi
for later that night.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.162
Because he was at home asleep.

11:00.187 --> 11:02.149
That blood was
the only evidence of foul play.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.451
And it's how you painted Josh
as a violent assailant.

11:04.486 --> 11:06.319
Detective Quinn talked
to a waitress at the diner

11:06.347 --> 11:08.822
who said that she saw Josh
touching Sierra inappropriately

11:08.857 --> 11:10.223
then saw the two leave together.

11:10.258 --> 11:11.557
Someone needs to go talk to the witness.

11:11.592 --> 11:13.091
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

11:13.126 --> 11:14.518
I need someone who doesn't
have an ax to grind.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.588
Tess, go speak to the waitress.
Take Maxine with you.

11:29.843 --> 11:32.319
Hayes wants us to talk
to the waitress from the diner.

11:32.344 --> 11:34.278
Oh, great. I'll be there in a sec.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.494
Thanks so much for
meeting with us on your break.

11:44.134 --> 11:47.220
That poor girl. It's a miracle
she's still alive.

11:47.245 --> 11:49.658
Yes. Unfortunately,
that wasn't the least of it.

11:49.806 --> 11:51.863
The man you saw her with
the night she went missing...

11:51.888 --> 11:53.293
Uh, Josh Fleck.

11:53.472 --> 11:55.738
I see lots of people
come through every week.

11:55.824 --> 11:58.236
- He creeped me out.
- Care to elaborate?

11:58.261 --> 12:01.637
Mm, the way he was talking
to her, holding her hand.

12:01.672 --> 12:04.850
Young girl like that, you could
just tell something wasn't right.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.241
In your statement, you said you saw

12:06.277 --> 12:07.543
Josh and Sierra leave together.

12:07.578 --> 12:09.445
I'd come out here for a smoke,

12:09.480 --> 12:11.514
and I watched them get into his truck.

12:11.549 --> 12:13.882
And that was parked
on the side of the diner?

12:13.918 --> 12:15.601
That's right.

12:16.765 --> 12:18.847
Problem is, these big propane tanks

12:18.872 --> 12:20.789
were parked there at the time.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.227
Not only would it have been
a bad place for you to light up,

12:23.252 --> 12:26.422
but the tanks would've obstructed
your view of the parking lot.

12:28.455 --> 12:30.799
The penalty for perjury in New York
is up to seven years.

12:31.915 --> 12:34.790
Look, I saw them inside, I served them.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.304
Whatever was going on, it wasn't right.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.767
But you never saw them
drive off together?

12:40.179 --> 12:41.111
No.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.943
Then why did you tell
the police you did?

12:43.595 --> 12:45.744
That detective, he told me

12:45.769 --> 12:47.655
they found blood in Josh Fleck's truck.

12:47.790 --> 12:50.124
They knew he'd done it,
but they needed someone

12:50.149 --> 12:52.495
to confirm he and Sierra
left here together.

12:52.982 --> 12:54.552
I was trying to help.

12:58.935 --> 13:01.494
What does the U.S. Attorney
have on Wallace?

13:01.611 --> 13:03.017
He doesn't want me to tell you.

13:03.751 --> 13:05.106
And yet, you're here.

13:06.728 --> 13:09.023
Do you remember
when you and Wallace faced off

13:09.048 --> 13:10.741
on Tim Gore's insider trading case?

13:10.766 --> 13:13.177
Of course. My father
asked me to represent Tim,

13:13.202 --> 13:14.454
but we never made it to trial.

13:14.479 --> 13:16.008
- The charges were dropped.
- Yes.

13:16.033 --> 13:19.110
After Wallace's star witness
from the grand jury recanted.

13:19.135 --> 13:21.613
His confidential star witness
who now says

13:21.648 --> 13:23.582
that you pressured him into recanting.

13:24.350 --> 13:28.018
The U.S. Attorney thinks
that Wallace leaked

13:28.053 --> 13:30.120
the identity of the witness to me.

13:30.155 --> 13:32.256
- Exactly.
- That's a felony.

13:32.619 --> 13:34.377
Wallace could get disbarred.

13:35.213 --> 13:37.294
Edward Marchand's handling the case.

13:37.329 --> 13:39.291
I know him. He's tough.

13:39.499 --> 13:42.814
Right now, he's offering Wallace a deal
that would keep him out of jail.

13:43.744 --> 13:45.869
That would end his political career.

13:46.002 --> 13:48.728
I know. But he's considering it.

13:51.835 --> 13:54.343
Wallace didn't leak the name to me.

13:55.718 --> 13:58.749
And I will testify to that effect
in front of the U.S. Attorney.

14:00.186 --> 14:02.861
As Wallace's attorney, I'm thrilled.

14:03.619 --> 14:06.078
As your friend, I'll point out
that you'll be asked

14:06.103 --> 14:07.820
how you got a confidential
witness's name,

14:07.845 --> 14:09.164
and you will need to answer.

14:09.189 --> 14:11.159
Mm. I know.

14:11.194 --> 14:13.028
And depending on that answer,

14:13.063 --> 14:15.055
you could be in a lot
of trouble yourself.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.533
Call me in front of the U.S. Attorney.

14:25.968 --> 14:28.774
No wonder why they can't
fix the toilet at the precinct.

14:29.188 --> 14:30.773
The city blew their bankroll
on this place.

14:30.806 --> 14:31.796
What's up, Quinn?

14:31.821 --> 14:33.614
Come here.

14:34.616 --> 14:36.377
Sierra Macy.

14:36.718 --> 14:38.552
I figured you'd be calling about that.

14:39.057 --> 14:40.602
The waitress admitted to my colleague

14:40.627 --> 14:42.667
that she never saw them leave
the diner together.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.938
You told me she was a solid witness.

14:44.963 --> 14:46.298
You told me you needed to put Sierra

14:46.323 --> 14:47.931
in that dirtbag's truck
leaving the diner.

14:47.956 --> 14:50.645
I never meant you should
fabricate a witness statement.

14:50.670 --> 14:53.967
What does this matter?
Josh Fleck pled guilty.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.034
He obviously played a role in this.

14:56.070 --> 14:58.727
We put him away for her murder.
Clearly, she's not dead.

14:58.752 --> 15:00.946
The evidence still points
to him for the kidnapping.

15:00.971 --> 15:02.323
It might not.

15:02.705 --> 15:04.436
What the hell happened to you, Sam?

15:04.983 --> 15:07.530
All of this
Monday morning quarterbacking,

15:07.733 --> 15:10.281
overturning cases
we busted our asses off to make.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.957
And we did that to get
the bad guys off the street.

15:12.982 --> 15:13.973
That's important work.

15:13.998 --> 15:15.707
So is making sure
we actually got the bad guys,

15:15.732 --> 15:19.056
because if we didn't, whoever
grabbed Sierra is still out there.

15:24.764 --> 15:26.328
We didn't screw up.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.436
New info on Josh Fleck.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.601
Sierra Macy's not the first girl
he overstepped with.

15:30.626 --> 15:31.756
Angela Cheng.

15:31.781 --> 15:32.922
She didn't go to Josh's school,

15:32.947 --> 15:34.657
and yet her parents
filed a complaint there.

15:34.682 --> 15:35.689
Why?

15:35.714 --> 15:38.441
Apparently, he sexually
assaulted their daughter.

15:40.145 --> 15:42.145
There's no mention of her
in any of your case notes.

15:42.180 --> 15:44.313
Josh pled to Sierra's murder
before I found out about it,

15:44.405 --> 15:46.053
but he met Angela on a message board,

15:46.108 --> 15:47.678
and she was 16 years old.

15:48.753 --> 15:50.915
You still think this guy's innocent?

16:00.205 --> 16:01.603
_

16:02.392 --> 16:05.205
You have a history
of dating underage girls,

16:05.300 --> 16:06.908
like Angela Cheng.

16:07.169 --> 16:09.269
Angela said she was 20 in her post.

16:09.304 --> 16:11.104
She said the same thing in person.

16:11.140 --> 16:12.804
We looked for that post,
couldn't find it.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.414
It was over a decade ago.

16:14.439 --> 16:15.974
Her parents made her delete it
when they found out...

16:16.010 --> 16:17.578
Or maybe you're a predator.

16:17.611 --> 16:19.453
What was next for Angela? Abduction?

16:19.537 --> 16:22.081
That is ridiculous. She came on to me.

16:22.116 --> 16:23.682
Blaming the victim's not
gonna get you out of here.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.516
I'm not blaming her. It was consensual.

16:26.602 --> 16:27.719
That's not what Angela said.

16:27.763 --> 16:29.828
She told us that
you forced yourself on her.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.368
- Sam!
- Hey!

16:32.125 --> 16:33.218
Just like you did with Sierra.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.726
- That is a lie.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.595
Says the man in the orange jumpsuit.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.431
You want to talk about a victim?

16:39.466 --> 16:42.600
How about the guy doing 20 years
for a crime he didn't commit?

16:42.635 --> 16:44.828
Josh, we are here to help you.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.468
Maybe you are.

16:46.595 --> 16:48.705
But he's trying to railroad me again.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.995
- I just want your side of the story.
- I already told you.

16:53.081 --> 16:55.612
Angela said she was 20. She looked 20.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.081
She was underage.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.749
Vulnerable.

17:00.354 --> 17:03.789
Your preferred target, just like Sierra.

17:05.683 --> 17:08.233
I've got nothing more to say to you.

17:09.272 --> 17:10.830
Guard!

17:20.971 --> 17:22.704
What was that?

17:23.365 --> 17:24.723
Just trying to cut through the lies.

17:24.748 --> 17:26.208
By telling more lies?

17:26.242 --> 17:27.616
We never found Angela.

17:27.641 --> 17:28.906
He doesn't know that.

17:28.931 --> 17:29.844
Oh, come on, Maxine.

17:29.871 --> 17:31.351
All the years
we've worked cases together,

17:31.376 --> 17:32.914
I've seen you lie to dozens of perps.

17:32.949 --> 17:34.271
Josh is right.

17:34.296 --> 17:35.726
You're trying to railroad him again.

17:35.751 --> 17:37.648
He's a viable suspect.

17:38.254 --> 17:39.454
And if you weren't still pissed

17:39.489 --> 17:41.589
about what happened with the
filmmaker, you'd agree with me.

17:41.624 --> 17:43.029
Like hell I would.

17:43.126 --> 17:45.420
Your blood evidence
against Josh is suspect,

17:45.521 --> 17:47.806
your main witness outright lied,

17:47.831 --> 17:50.534
and there is nothing
connecting him to the man

17:50.559 --> 17:52.633
who held Sierra captive for 10 years.

17:52.668 --> 17:55.370
So you need to wake up or back off!

18:33.306 --> 18:34.826
Frankie has an idea.

18:34.974 --> 18:36.940
Wallace just summoned me,
so take your time.

18:36.976 --> 18:39.577
I've run everything I could find on
Gunther, but this guy was careful.

18:39.612 --> 18:41.893
No credit cards,
only used burner phones.

18:41.918 --> 18:44.114
Explains why we're having a hard
time connecting him to Josh.

18:44.150 --> 18:46.783
Josh's actual innocence
being another explanation.

18:46.818 --> 18:49.213
It got me thinking. The only person
besides the kidnapper

18:49.238 --> 18:51.487
who knows the truth
about that night is Sierra.

18:51.768 --> 18:54.123
You ever heard of state-dependent
memory retrieval?

18:54.159 --> 18:55.625
I have a feeling I'm about to.

18:55.661 --> 18:57.561
It's the use of psychotropic drugs

18:57.596 --> 18:59.028
to recover repressed memories.

18:59.064 --> 19:01.087
Works even better
if the subject was on drugs

19:01.112 --> 19:04.032
- at the time the memory was formed.
- Sierra was clearly drugged.

19:04.068 --> 19:05.967
Her symptoms... the dry mouth,
disorientation,

19:06.003 --> 19:08.036
memory loss...
are consistent with an opioid.

19:08.072 --> 19:09.871
Most likely fentanyl or hydromorphone.

19:09.907 --> 19:12.074
You want to turn Sierra into a lab rat.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.745
Maybe if we bring her back to the diner,
her memories will come back to her.

19:14.912 --> 19:17.179
She'll be able to identify
Josh Fleck as her kidnapper.

19:17.215 --> 19:18.880
Or if it was someone else.

19:18.916 --> 19:21.716
Dr. Lorraine Maltin is an expert
in this type of memory retrieval.

19:21.751 --> 19:23.726
She volunteered to supervise
the whole thing.

19:23.976 --> 19:27.297
Just keep Sierra safe.
She has been through enough.

19:29.633 --> 19:32.203
_

19:35.198 --> 19:37.864
I spoke to Naomi. You're not testifying.

19:37.899 --> 19:38.837
Of course I am.

19:38.862 --> 19:40.752
You didn't leak the witness' name to me.

19:41.635 --> 19:43.036
I stole it from you.

19:44.373 --> 19:46.285
I was over at your place one night,

19:46.348 --> 19:48.526
and I saw the grand jury minutes
in your briefcase,

19:48.551 --> 19:50.176
and I read them.

19:50.212 --> 19:51.574
I know.

19:51.947 --> 19:54.113
- I was counting on that.
- Wait. What?

19:54.410 --> 19:57.613
I left my briefcase open with
the grand jury minutes on top.

19:57.752 --> 19:59.252
I knew you wouldn't be able
to help yourself.

19:59.287 --> 20:00.720
Why would you do that?

20:00.755 --> 20:01.830
So you could win.

20:01.855 --> 20:04.757
It was a frivolous white-collar case.
It meant nothing to me.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.692
You were on the partner track.
I wanted to help you.

20:06.728 --> 20:09.094
Oh, like I couldn't
have beaten you on my own?

20:09.130 --> 20:11.929
The point is
I'm responsible for the leak.

20:11.965 --> 20:13.322
I'm going to take the deal.

20:13.347 --> 20:16.582
I don't want you to. I stole the
damn minutes. Let me testify.

20:16.607 --> 20:18.770
I won't be responsible
for you getting disbarred.

20:18.805 --> 20:20.377
Oh, don't you dare
"knight in shining armor" me.

20:20.402 --> 20:21.925
Okay.

20:22.276 --> 20:24.838
I also don't want to risk
tanking the CIU.

20:25.312 --> 20:26.651
That's my legacy.

20:27.409 --> 20:29.417
You take this deal,

20:29.672 --> 20:31.776
your political career is over.

20:32.346 --> 20:34.618
I can live with that.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.930
Dr. Maltin will take Sierra

20:40.955 --> 20:43.126
through the events
leading up to her abduction.

20:43.162 --> 20:45.161
You can stop any time you need, okay?

20:45.829 --> 20:47.868
I spent the last 10 years of my life

20:48.032 --> 20:49.641
trapped in a tiny cell,

20:49.899 --> 20:54.136
hoping and... praying
that someone would save me.

20:54.172 --> 20:57.209
And if Mr. Fleck is innocent,
he's doing the same.

20:57.771 --> 20:59.873
I have to help him.

21:00.779 --> 21:04.959
Sierra, I'm gonna inject you
with a small does of fentanyl.

21:05.685 --> 21:07.952
It'll make you feel
a little disoriented.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.318
That's all.

21:18.361 --> 21:19.809
Now look around.

21:21.897 --> 21:25.395
I want you to try to put yourself
back in the night you disappeared...

21:25.802 --> 21:29.303
how you felt, what you were thinking.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.824
I wanted to get away.

21:33.909 --> 21:35.342
That's good, Sierra.

21:35.449 --> 21:37.143
What else were you feeling?

21:37.544 --> 21:39.958
I had to get out of the house.

21:42.293 --> 21:44.794
I didn't know where I was gonna go.

21:46.341 --> 21:49.248
I went to the train station,
but I chickened out.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.396
That's when I called Mr. Fleck.

21:53.799 --> 21:55.697
He brought me here.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.247
I was cold.

22:01.739 --> 22:03.841
He gave me his jacket.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.201
Mr. Fleck ordered a hot chocolate.

22:09.935 --> 22:12.209
He said it would make me feel better,

22:12.927 --> 22:14.615
and it did.

22:17.917 --> 22:19.688
Did he seem nervous?

22:20.704 --> 22:21.829
No.

22:21.854 --> 22:23.521
How about the other people in the diner?

22:23.587 --> 22:26.390
Did anyone stand out, look suspicious?

22:40.039 --> 22:41.438
No.

22:41.578 --> 22:44.452
I'm sorry. I wish I was more help.

22:44.477 --> 22:46.211
Oh, it's okay.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.229
Maybe Josh was the only
suspicious person.

22:51.126 --> 22:52.892
So, what happened next?

22:53.573 --> 22:56.103
He calmed me down,

22:57.009 --> 22:59.009
said he would take me home,

23:00.893 --> 23:02.625
and then we left.

23:09.563 --> 23:11.149
I don't remember.

23:11.968 --> 23:14.867
Take a few deep breaths. Try and relax.

23:20.008 --> 23:21.932
There's nothing. I'm sorry.

23:22.104 --> 23:23.270
I'm trying.

23:23.345 --> 23:25.080
You're doing a great job, Sierra.

23:29.236 --> 23:30.440
Wait.

23:31.487 --> 23:33.675
Wait. I went to the bathroom.

23:35.156 --> 23:37.122
I wanted to clean myself up.

23:39.260 --> 23:41.303
Someone came up behind me.

23:41.564 --> 23:44.064
I felt a pinch like... like a needle.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.335
Did you see who it was?

23:47.602 --> 23:48.991
No.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.720
But I-I-I felt... heavy.

23:52.996 --> 23:55.009
It was dark.

23:55.446 --> 23:57.712
I was in the trunk of a car.

23:58.011 --> 24:00.311
I-I-I felt like I was there for hours.

24:01.949 --> 24:02.981
Then I was at a house.

24:03.016 --> 24:04.983
- Gunther's house?
- No, that was later.

24:05.018 --> 24:07.112
Like, a few days later.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.411
I was blindfolded.

24:11.524 --> 24:13.323
But... But I could hear things.

24:13.763 --> 24:15.427
Chimes.

24:16.161 --> 24:19.170
For days, all I could hear
was stupid chimes.

24:19.231 --> 24:20.531
What about faces?

24:20.906 --> 24:22.500
This is important, Sierra.

24:22.601 --> 24:24.635
Did you see who put you in the trunk?

24:25.219 --> 24:27.136
- No.
- Was it Mr. Fleck?

24:27.171 --> 24:28.288
I don't know.

24:28.313 --> 24:32.171
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- That's enough. Leave her alone.

24:33.316 --> 24:34.616
Josh drove a pickup.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.289
- No trunk.
- Maybe he used a different car.

24:37.314 --> 24:39.203
It's a different kidnapper.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.317
Think you locked up the wrong dude.

24:54.094 --> 24:55.569
_

24:55.594 --> 24:57.601
...when she was sexually abused
and deprived

24:57.626 --> 24:59.896
of all contact with the outside world.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.764
Neighbors were reeling at the discovery

25:01.800 --> 25:03.599
of something so gruesome
in a neighborhood

25:03.624 --> 25:06.011
they thought was a safe haven
for their families.

25:06.279 --> 25:08.965
New York's Conviction Integrity
Unit, in conjunction...

25:08.990 --> 25:11.381
I told you this case would hurt.

25:11.542 --> 25:12.708
What are you doing here, Hayes?

25:12.743 --> 25:16.044
Following a trail of drunk texts
that get progressively more pathetic.

25:17.134 --> 25:19.384
"I think I made a mistake about Josh.

25:19.584 --> 25:21.898
I'm taking myself off the case."
Blah, blah, blah.

25:21.923 --> 25:23.887
You really walk all that way
to lord that over me?

25:23.912 --> 25:26.099
Uh, self-pity isn't your strong suit.

25:28.225 --> 25:30.127
The night Josh pled guilty,

25:30.227 --> 25:32.509
I stood on that booth right there,

25:33.181 --> 25:35.369
and I bought a round for the house.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.234
Took me a month to pay off that bar tab,

25:38.259 --> 25:40.212
but it was worth it.

25:47.243 --> 25:48.709
What the hell are you doing?

25:48.744 --> 25:51.169
Clearly, you want to punish yourself.
I figured I'd help.

25:55.108 --> 25:56.349
You could've hit me.

25:56.468 --> 25:57.883
I was trying to.

25:57.975 --> 25:59.640
You know what your problem is?

25:59.754 --> 26:01.630
You're not a seasoned screwup like me.

26:01.655 --> 26:04.549
- You haven't perfected the rebound.
- So my problem is I'm too good?

26:04.574 --> 26:06.359
Oh, no.

26:06.394 --> 26:08.227
It's just that you think
of yourself that way,

26:08.263 --> 26:11.422
and that there's this clean line
between the good guys and the bad guys,

26:11.447 --> 26:13.310
and your job is to hold
that line secure.

26:13.335 --> 26:14.335
Is that so wrong?

26:14.360 --> 26:16.940
Yeah, because it has nothing
to do with reality.

26:17.103 --> 26:19.112
We're all bad guys in someone's story.

26:19.207 --> 26:20.573
You're Josh Fleck's.

26:21.549 --> 26:23.375
And I should just accept that?

26:23.651 --> 26:26.797
Or you can start the rewrite. Up to you.

26:43.429 --> 26:44.810
Rough night?

26:44.835 --> 26:46.521
Been going over Sierra's case file.

26:46.554 --> 26:48.472
Whatever you need to ask her,
it'll have to wait.

26:48.513 --> 26:49.818
I came to talk to you.

26:49.927 --> 26:51.066
May I?

26:53.638 --> 26:55.015
Thank you.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.179
10 years ago, I sat in this room,

26:58.310 --> 27:00.459
and I asked you who else
might've taken Sierra.

27:00.484 --> 27:01.365
I remember.

27:01.398 --> 27:03.088
And we talked about your boyfriend Liam.

27:03.113 --> 27:04.557
We're not together anymore.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.150
You swore to me that he spent
the entire night with you.

27:07.984 --> 27:10.819
At 12:30 a.m. on the night
that Sierra disappeared,

27:10.963 --> 27:14.289
Liam was stopped by a state trooper
for a busted taillight on 295.

27:14.325 --> 27:16.111
He was out looking for her.

27:16.193 --> 27:17.619
Was he?

27:19.062 --> 27:22.363
295 north is the road he would've
taken to Gunther's house.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.271
I didn't want to believe
he could've, but...

27:32.875 --> 27:35.801
Carla, what else didn't
you tell us about Liam?

27:38.231 --> 27:40.814
Wallace wants to take a bullet for you,
and you're mad at him?

27:40.849 --> 27:43.316
- Just doesn't make sense.
- He's trying to protect you.

27:43.343 --> 27:45.512
Well, I don't need protection,
and his political career,

27:45.546 --> 27:46.919
he wouldn't give that up for anyone.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.289
No one asked you to do that.

27:50.325 --> 27:52.158
It's not for you, it's for me.

27:52.864 --> 27:54.479
I think that you're upset with Wallace

27:54.504 --> 27:56.129
because you want to protect him.

27:56.154 --> 27:58.129
You want to be his
knight in shining armor.

27:58.153 --> 27:59.730
- No way!
- Because...

27:59.832 --> 28:01.197
you want to win him back from Naomi.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.668
You're out of your mind.

28:02.703 --> 28:04.470
I want him to owe me for a change.

28:04.729 --> 28:06.229
Whatever you say.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.728
The election's getting close.
How are you feeling?

28:08.753 --> 28:11.292
Mm. Nice subject change.

28:11.512 --> 28:13.344
We're cautiously optimistic.

28:16.891 --> 28:19.491
My work here is done. Bye.

28:21.508 --> 28:24.856
Once I pointed out
holes in Liam's story, Carla opened up.

28:27.878 --> 28:30.727
So, he was, um, also a vet tech.
He had access to fentanyl.

28:30.763 --> 28:32.328
Oh, look, you started without me.

28:32.872 --> 28:34.338
This is Liam Strout...

28:34.363 --> 28:35.965
Carla's former live-in boyfriend.

28:36.001 --> 28:36.966
How's the hangover?

28:37.836 --> 28:38.902
I'll survive.

28:38.937 --> 28:42.038
Liam moved in with Carla
six months before Sierra disappeared.

28:42.073 --> 28:43.373
Sierra started acting up
around that time.

28:43.409 --> 28:45.759
Teenage girl doesn't like
Mom's new boyfriend.

28:45.784 --> 28:47.517
What differentiates this
from "Gossip Girl"?

28:47.542 --> 28:49.540
Carla said that Liam and Sierra
argued a lot,

28:49.565 --> 28:50.979
but that night, it got physical.

28:51.015 --> 28:52.448
She ran because she was afraid of him.

28:52.483 --> 28:53.957
Liam's never been considered
a person of interest.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.985
Not until now. But I did some digging,
looked into his financials.

28:57.021 --> 28:58.479
Two months after Sierra disappeared,

28:58.504 --> 29:00.856
he put a large down payment
on a condo in Williamsburg.

29:01.959 --> 29:03.358
$80,000 in cash.

29:03.394 --> 29:05.493
You think Liam sold Sierra to Gunther?

29:05.529 --> 29:09.330
He was supposedly out looking for her
between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.

29:09.365 --> 29:11.198
More than enough time
to drive to Gunther's and back.

29:11.234 --> 29:14.335
Sounds like a solid new suspect.
Let's bring him in.

29:23.175 --> 29:24.385
_

29:24.842 --> 29:27.660
Carla and me, we had a good thing going.

29:27.779 --> 29:31.013
Always wondered if we'd have
made it work, you know,

29:31.049 --> 29:32.381
if Sierra hadn't gone missing.

29:32.416 --> 29:34.056
Yeah, but you and Sierra
didn't get along.

29:35.619 --> 29:38.412
She was a teenager.
I was dating her mom.

29:38.789 --> 29:42.356
It was awkward sometimes,
you know, but we made it work.

29:42.392 --> 29:45.302
When you slammed her against the wall,
was that making it work?

29:45.762 --> 29:46.961
Trust me,

29:47.263 --> 29:48.925
if you lived under
the same roof as that girl,

29:48.950 --> 29:50.935
you would've lost your cool, too.

29:51.161 --> 29:53.935
The night Sierra went missing,
you went looking for her.

29:53.970 --> 29:55.736
Carla was freaking out. I was, too.

29:55.771 --> 29:56.871
You were home around 2:00 a.m.?

29:56.896 --> 29:58.191
- What's your point?
- I didn't look hard enough?

29:58.216 --> 29:59.816
You had plenty of time
to pick her up at the diner

29:59.841 --> 30:01.441
and drop her at Peter Gunther's place.

30:01.476 --> 30:03.085
You think I gave her to that psycho?

30:03.110 --> 30:04.475
Gave? No, no, no.

30:05.557 --> 30:06.824
Sold.

30:08.317 --> 30:09.616
Two months after Sierra disappeared,

30:09.641 --> 30:12.218
you put an $80,000 deposit
on a Brooklyn condo.

30:12.243 --> 30:13.686
That's a lot of money for anyone,

30:13.855 --> 30:15.398
especially a vet tech...

30:15.423 --> 30:17.131
a job that gives you access to fentanyl.

30:17.156 --> 30:19.056
That's what you used on Sierra, right?

30:20.418 --> 30:24.870
Sierra Macy was a mess
long before I met her.

30:24.895 --> 30:27.559
It was only a matter of time
before she got herself in trouble.

30:27.692 --> 30:31.065
Anything else you want to know,
ask my lawyer.

30:38.123 --> 30:40.249
Oh, what happened with the ex?

30:40.347 --> 30:41.512
I shook him.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.614
He didn't break.

30:42.649 --> 30:44.015
Maybe he'll make a mistake

30:44.058 --> 30:45.990
now that he knows
that we're looking at him.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.421
Yeah, I'll call the 91st,

30:47.446 --> 30:49.211
see if they can spare a squad
to keep eyes on him.

30:49.236 --> 30:51.169
Good idea.

30:52.037 --> 30:53.637
You were right.

30:54.984 --> 30:57.070
I should've stepped off this case.

30:58.101 --> 31:00.891
It's not easy to face your screw-ups.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.524
I guess we all handle it in our own way.

31:04.249 --> 31:05.788
I'm gonna make it right.

31:06.555 --> 31:08.782
It might not be that simple,

31:09.332 --> 31:11.324
but good for you for trying.

31:13.711 --> 31:15.822
- The waitress at the diner...
- Melissa DeLeon.

31:15.847 --> 31:17.402
I'm gonna show her Liam's picture.

31:17.427 --> 31:19.128
Maybe she can
place him there that night.

31:22.653 --> 31:23.718
Happy to do it.

31:23.754 --> 31:25.451
I understand you're ready
to accept the plea deal

31:25.476 --> 31:26.989
and acknowledge your wrongdoing.

31:27.024 --> 31:28.024
That's correct.

31:28.065 --> 31:29.865
It's okay, he's expecting me.

31:29.894 --> 31:31.026
Don't start the party without me.

31:31.061 --> 31:32.102
Little busy here.

31:32.127 --> 31:34.369
I am sorry to interrupt, except I'm not.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.031
Hayes. What are you doing?

31:36.066 --> 31:38.800
- Testifying.
- You haven't been sworn in.

31:38.835 --> 31:39.801
Details.

31:39.836 --> 31:42.036
Wallace didn't leak
the grand jury minutes.

31:42.071 --> 31:45.183
Then how did you learn
the identity of the key witness?

31:45.339 --> 31:46.841
From the grand jury minutes.

31:47.058 --> 31:48.582
Wallace didn't give them to me.

31:48.644 --> 31:51.179
They were mailed to me
by an anonymous source.

31:51.496 --> 31:52.713
Convenient.

31:52.748 --> 31:54.421
That's what I thought,
so I looked into it.

31:54.446 --> 31:55.789
Guess who it was traced back to?

31:55.814 --> 31:57.108
- Hayes...
- Chuck Sawyer.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.524
He was a paralegal
at the Chicago D.A.'s office.

32:01.549 --> 32:03.523
Turns out he hated you.

32:03.558 --> 32:06.773
Guess Chuck wanted to get even
by sinking your big break with the feds.

32:06.812 --> 32:08.872
Well, let's hope Mr. Sawyer corroborates

32:08.897 --> 32:10.497
your story when I subpoena him.

32:10.532 --> 32:12.994
I'm sure he'd be happy to,
except he's dead.

32:13.019 --> 32:14.800
Passed away in February.

32:14.836 --> 32:16.969
Then I'll need to hear it from you,

32:17.215 --> 32:20.706
assuming you're willing
to take the stand officially.

32:20.742 --> 32:21.974
I'd love to.

32:22.382 --> 32:24.437
We won't be taking that deal.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.219
Melissa DeLeon?

32:31.351 --> 32:32.416
I know you?

32:32.452 --> 32:35.386
Sam Spencer, from the City's
Conviction Integrity Unit.

32:35.477 --> 32:37.743
Can I ask you a few questions?

32:38.358 --> 32:40.191
Thank you.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.948
Hey, so I did some more digging on Liam.

32:47.143 --> 32:51.368
This is a copy of a wire transfer
from Liam's brotherin-law in Miami.

32:51.403 --> 32:52.507
Liam wasn't lying.

32:52.532 --> 32:54.195
He borrowed money for the condo.

32:54.220 --> 32:55.335
Well, that accounts for the cash,

32:55.360 --> 32:56.940
but it still doesn't let
Liam off the hook entirely.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.562
Anything on the fentanyl lead?

32:58.587 --> 33:01.880
I phoned Liam's old supervisor
at the shelter three times,

33:01.905 --> 33:02.983
but they haven't called me back.

33:03.008 --> 33:04.547
Then we need to go there
in person and get some answers.

33:04.582 --> 33:05.826
You may not need to.

33:05.851 --> 33:08.384
I went looking for a connection
between Liam and Gunther,

33:08.419 --> 33:11.011
- came across this instead.
- It's an old ConEd bill.

33:11.036 --> 33:12.889
For Gunther's house in Yonkers.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.490
Look who's name is on the payment slip.

33:14.848 --> 33:16.458
Melissa DeLeon?

33:17.091 --> 33:20.341
We need to call Sam now.

33:26.798 --> 33:28.469
Thanks again for cooperating.

33:28.505 --> 33:31.203
I thought they had the man
who abducted that poor girl.

33:31.228 --> 33:33.426
Well, we're considering other suspects.

33:33.696 --> 33:35.728
Do you recognize this man

33:35.855 --> 33:37.910
from the night you saw Sierra
at the diner?

33:38.081 --> 33:39.916
Would've been driving this car.

33:39.941 --> 33:42.973
He looks familiar, but, uh...

33:43.067 --> 33:45.856
- Give me a sec. Let me grab my glasses.
- Okay.

34:04.505 --> 34:06.405
These chimes,
how long have you had them?

34:06.441 --> 34:09.213
I got them in Cabo about 20 years ago.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.143
You kidnapped Sierra.

34:15.168 --> 34:16.949
Show me your hands!

34:17.239 --> 34:19.451
Don't say another word.

34:25.192 --> 34:27.045
Killing me is only gonna
make your problems worse.

34:27.054 --> 34:28.679
My team knows I came to see you.

34:28.704 --> 34:30.524
They know where I am.

34:32.478 --> 34:34.311
I loved Gunther.

34:34.409 --> 34:38.543
So you helped him rape
and torture Sierra for 10 years?

34:38.579 --> 34:41.190
You're the reason he had all that time.

34:41.216 --> 34:43.357
Locking up the wrong man.

34:44.138 --> 34:46.841
Didn't work out for me, either.

34:46.909 --> 34:48.320
He didn't need me anymore.

34:48.355 --> 34:49.687
So why didn't you turn him in?

34:49.947 --> 34:52.190
That'd mean turning myself in.

34:53.411 --> 34:55.659
Stay back.

34:58.832 --> 35:00.499
All you did was take her.

35:00.601 --> 35:02.398
You didn't know
what Gunther was gonna do.

35:02.617 --> 35:06.163
You'll be out in 10 years,
6 for good behavior.

35:06.339 --> 35:09.954
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.

35:11.344 --> 35:12.544
- Move, move!
- Freeze! Freeze!

35:12.578 --> 35:14.678
- Drop it!
- Stay right where you are.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.013
Now!

35:31.763 --> 35:35.365
Melissa DeLeon admitted
to abducting Sierra.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.434
Your conviction's been vacated.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.935
You're a free man.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.209
People will still think
I was involved...

35:49.756 --> 35:51.279
no matter what I do.

35:51.304 --> 35:53.314
I'll do whatever I can to make it right.

35:53.750 --> 35:56.478
I've been in here 10 years.

35:57.307 --> 36:00.564
Do you have any idea how long that is...

36:00.890 --> 36:03.009
when you're locked in a cage,

36:03.572 --> 36:05.572
staring at a cement wall?

36:07.597 --> 36:09.890
- I know you've been through hell.
- No, you don't.

36:10.776 --> 36:13.436
You have no damn idea.

36:15.103 --> 36:16.937
You had a life.

36:17.072 --> 36:19.265
I had nothing.

36:20.202 --> 36:21.575
I'm sorry.

36:21.827 --> 36:24.421
You stole those years from me.

36:24.946 --> 36:27.249
I will never get them back,

36:27.916 --> 36:29.952
and I will never forgive you.

37:00.549 --> 37:03.186
Josh, there are still rumors
you were involved in the kidnapping.

37:03.211 --> 37:04.180
Any comment?

37:04.216 --> 37:06.483
Josh, think you'll ever get
a teaching job again?

37:06.518 --> 37:08.527
I, uh...

37:08.715 --> 37:10.262
I, uh...

37:17.963 --> 37:19.861
Hey, Mr. Fleck.

37:25.850 --> 37:27.670
Mr. Fleck, please.

37:44.008 --> 37:45.337
Thanks.

37:45.422 --> 37:46.477
For what?

37:46.813 --> 37:48.370
Saving my life.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.183
Oh, that.

37:50.454 --> 37:52.042
You know, line of duty.

37:52.529 --> 37:54.222
You were right.

37:54.311 --> 37:55.932
I needed a wake-up call.

37:56.878 --> 38:00.401
Well, I think being held hostage
by a psychopath qualifies.

38:00.798 --> 38:02.423
Yeah.

38:02.571 --> 38:05.071
We've seen some crazy things lately.

38:06.110 --> 38:07.582
You okay with all of it?

38:07.696 --> 38:09.098
Yeah.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.077
'Cause we've known each other
a long time.

38:11.113 --> 38:12.380
If you ever want to talk...

38:12.405 --> 38:13.686
I'm good.

38:13.881 --> 38:15.608
But thanks.

38:21.423 --> 38:23.104
I'm going home.

38:53.219 --> 38:54.733
I was gonna call you.

38:54.875 --> 38:58.021
What you did for me earlier
with the A.U.S.A. was...

38:58.046 --> 38:59.914
Heroic, wasn't it?

39:00.226 --> 39:03.406
Well, conniving, really.

39:03.962 --> 39:07.492
Not nearly as conniving as what you did.

39:08.933 --> 39:10.600
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:11.847 --> 39:13.880
When you were ready to take the deal,

39:14.081 --> 39:17.073
something kept bothering me,
well, two things, really...

39:17.098 --> 39:19.475
why you gave me the grand jury minutes

39:19.510 --> 39:20.876
and why you would take a deal

39:20.911 --> 39:23.140
that would end your political career.

39:23.947 --> 39:26.703
Turns out, both questions
have the same answer.

39:26.728 --> 39:29.397
See, I remember when Tim Gore's
charges were dropped,

39:29.422 --> 39:31.733
you met my parents for the first time.

39:31.822 --> 39:33.054
My dad liked you immediately,

39:33.090 --> 39:35.557
which is atypical for him,
to say the least,

39:35.593 --> 39:37.558
but made perfect sense

39:37.594 --> 39:39.627
because you'd already done him a favor.

39:39.662 --> 39:42.129
You gave me the grand jury minutes

39:42.164 --> 39:45.225
because my father asked you
to throw the case

39:45.250 --> 39:48.669
because my client
was his friend and backer,

39:49.074 --> 39:51.171
which leads me to the present moment.

39:51.293 --> 39:55.302
What did my parents promise
to make you take the fall for me now?

39:55.327 --> 39:58.327
- None of that matters now...
- Don't even think about handling me.

40:01.683 --> 40:04.467
Judge Burgos is retiring
at the end of the year.

40:04.827 --> 40:06.568
District Court.

40:06.709 --> 40:08.829
White House is gonna need
a nominee to fill the void

40:08.857 --> 40:10.228
between Harper and your dad.

40:10.253 --> 40:11.957
It'd be a formality.

40:11.983 --> 40:15.767
Taking the deal would've meant
you stepping down as D.A.,

40:15.792 --> 40:16.946
but wouldn't have blocked you

40:16.971 --> 40:19.306
from being appointed
to federal judgeship.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.547
That's a job for life.

40:22.570 --> 40:23.758
- You know, Hayes, maybe you...
- You lied to me.

40:23.783 --> 40:25.758
You made me think
that you were protecting me.

40:25.783 --> 40:27.985
I did. I didn't want you
to get disbarred.

40:28.010 --> 40:30.142
But not enough to make
an actual sacrifice

40:30.167 --> 40:32.511
or even be honest
about what was going on.

40:32.646 --> 40:34.894
Perfect. You're here.

40:35.970 --> 40:37.494
I just got word.

40:37.759 --> 40:41.463
Since the U.S. Attorney came up
empty on the grand jury leak,

40:41.559 --> 40:44.270
he is shutting down
his investigation of you.

40:44.528 --> 40:47.239
It's over. You won.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.693
Thanks to you.

40:50.076 --> 40:52.459
Hayes, join us?

40:52.832 --> 40:54.381
Oh.

40:54.933 --> 40:57.113
He's all yours, Naomi.
