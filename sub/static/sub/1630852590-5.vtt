00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
Previously on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

00:03.086 --> 00:04.796
I thought the springs dried up.

00:04.879 --> 00:08.383
The springs. They're back!
This means our luck is changing.

00:08.466 --> 00:11.302
I wanna help you bring this place
back to life. With a few phone calls,

00:11.386 --> 00:13.054
I'll have a dozen workers over here.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.807
That was no electrical surge.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.768
No way! I think our ghost
is getting really ticked off.

00:18.852 --> 00:22.063
Hoping I could talk you
into reconsidering my offer, Elijah.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.441
One bad season, heck, one bad accident,

00:24.524 --> 00:26.752
and all you'll leave your children with
is a mountain of debt.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.446
- Do you trust that man?
- I don't know who to trust.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.072
But I do know one thing for sure.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.324
You're not my sister.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.286
So who are you
and where did you come from?

00:36.369 --> 00:39.247
I've been trying to think
how I can prove I traveled through time,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.499
- but all I have is this.
- "Guys, help.

00:41.583 --> 00:42.625
I'm stuck in 1930.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.627
I'm trying my best
pretending to be Daisy."

00:44.711 --> 00:46.129
Daisy's my sister's name.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.423
You have to go to school
to maintain cover as Harper.

00:48.506 --> 00:51.009
You got every single question
on the quiz wrong.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.177
It's not like you at all.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.763
The truth is, I'm not who you think I am.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.935
I'm sorry, it's just...

01:01.686 --> 01:03.480
It's... It's... It's a lot to process. So…

01:04.397 --> 01:07.192
So... So you're saying that
you and your friend, Harper...

01:07.275 --> 01:08.735
We've both used your machine.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.653
And not just us. Daisy too.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.573
It says here she's stuck in the future.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.575
And if Harper's trapped in 1930...

01:15.658 --> 01:17.744
- That means they're both in trouble.
- Exactly.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.964
Which is why you need to get back
to work on that invention of yours.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, hold on.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.917
Now, even if all this is true,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.672
i-it doesn't change the fact
that my invention isn't working now.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.926
Yeah, but you're so close. You must be.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.137
Savannah, are you in there?
I need help with dinner.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.306
Sure, I'll just be a minute!

01:38.390 --> 01:40.642
No, no, no. No, no.
You go help your mother.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.895
Look, I'm just gonna finish up here,
and then I'll head down to the basement,

01:43.978 --> 01:46.356
and I'll take a look at that...

01:46.439 --> 01:47.732
Time machine.

01:47.816 --> 01:48.817
Yeah.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.823
I think I have an idea
to get it up and running.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.782
Cool! I'll see you in the basement
after dinner.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.589
Whoa! What's that?

02:11.673 --> 02:14.033
Found it in the springs.
Guess it's some kind of weird rock.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.844
Not like any rock I've seen.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.512
Maybe it's from space.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.181
Definite alien vibes.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.642
Could be.
Why don't you guys do some research?

02:26.896 --> 02:29.566
Oh, no! We broke it.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.114
What do you mean
you're not who I think you are?

02:37.282 --> 02:38.283
I just meant, I'm…

02:40.994 --> 02:43.246
not as smart as you thought I was.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.667
I get it. There's a lot of pressure
on kids these days.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.670
If you'd done the reading,
the quiz should've been easy.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.548
I know. And I'll do better
next time, really.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.092
You're one of my best students, Harper.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.137
Which is why I'm going to allow you
to take a makeup quiz tomorrow.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.766
This time, come prepared. Fair?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.601
Yes, ma'am. Very fair.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.359
Hey, nice save.

03:12.442 --> 03:16.112
- So listen, I've been thinking...
- No, Griffin. I can't do this anymore!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.197
I'm a nervous wreck.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.675
Every second I stay here
is just another chance I'll get caught.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.552
- And then what?
- But you've been doing so great.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.660
Great?

03:22.744 --> 03:25.997
Until this morning, I didn't even know
we had 50 states. Alaska and Hawaii?

03:26.081 --> 03:28.416
- When did that happen?
- I don't know. A while ago.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.002
Look, I was thinking about
what you said earlier.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.213
- Topher told you he was sleepwalking?
- Yes.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.382
He woke up this morning covered in mud.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.676
Said something about eating worms.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.094
- Worms?
- Yeah.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.281
See, that's pretty weird, even for him.
I mean, he's got to be hiding something.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.600
The crystal? Griffin, I told you.
I already searched his room.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.204
- You said you were interrupted.
- Yes! And I was almost caught.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.428
- It's too risky.
- Look, do you want to go home or not?

04:29.227 --> 04:31.479
Just down to the post office!

04:34.566 --> 04:37.068
Look who it is. Good afternoon, kids.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.361
Afternoon.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.071
Doing a little shopping, I see.

04:40.155 --> 04:43.825
Miss Landry's famous beignets.
Must be a special occasion.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.410
Mother's favorite.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.454
Papa treats us sometimes.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.247
Your father's a fine man.

04:49.330 --> 04:52.250
I just wish he'd let me help him
with your situation.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.710
We don't need your help.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.296
We just want the farm
to stay in our family.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.630
Well, of course you do.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.549
Well, that's what I want too.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.803
If only someone could get your father
to listen to reason

05:03.887 --> 05:04.971
and sign these.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.643
I'll talk to him.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.979
Smart girl. Let's work together.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.940
Save your sweet mother's farm
before it's too late.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.613
Why did you take those papers?

05:21.696 --> 05:23.031
Because if I didn't...

05:23.907 --> 05:25.742
I have a reason, okay?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.995
More of a feeling, actually.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.622
A feeling?

05:30.705 --> 05:31.956
I wish I could explain.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.043
So why can't you?
We tell each other everything.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.420
Or at least we used to

05:38.088 --> 05:39.881
before you started acting so strange.

05:39.964 --> 05:40.965
Sam.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.816
Oh, my gosh. The judge.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.151
He's really gonna do it.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.580
Nail it down good.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.374
That deck is rotted through.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.043
- Nice.
- You got it.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.297
- Uh, hi. You in charge here?
- I am. Are you the owner?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.966
Depends. You about to hand me a bill?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.968
Actually,
someone's already taken care of that.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.096
- That would be me. Bennett Campbell.
- Appreciate the business, sir.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.390
We never worked a job
in Sulphur Springs before.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.017
Really? Where are you from?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.352
Waller City,
about a hundred miles north of here.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.647
Heard you guys are having
some plumbing issues.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.065
Mind if I take a peek?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.316
Go right ahead.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.325
Dad, this is generous,
but you should've talked to us first.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.453
Oh! Oh.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.580
I'm sorry, Bennett.
I thought we covered that.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.831
When? You just got here.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.001
Come here.
There's something I wanna show you.

07:00.128 --> 07:04.215
What do you think about a parking garage
right over there?

07:04.299 --> 07:05.800
Once this place takes off,

07:05.884 --> 07:08.762
all those guests are gonna have to
have some place to park, right?

07:08.845 --> 07:11.598
- I guess so.
- Yeah. And that's only the beginning.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.641
Once this hotel is done, Bennett,

07:13.725 --> 07:17.520
trust me, everyone in town will forget
all about that ridiculous ghost business.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.065
Dad!

07:20.690 --> 07:22.817
Oh! Ah.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.361
Dad, are you okay?

07:25.653 --> 07:26.863
Better me than a guest.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.451
Looks like I got here just in time.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.491
Hello?

08:15.704 --> 08:16.705
Whoever's there,

08:17.706 --> 08:23.378
I'm under legal obligation to warn you,
these hands are lethal weapons.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.932
What're you doing in there?

08:36.016 --> 08:38.184
I could've seriously hurt you!

08:38.268 --> 08:39.519
What's going on in here?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.563
Harper was snooping
through my stuff again.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.857
No, I wasn't. I was just, um...

08:43.940 --> 08:45.608
Planning to do my laundry?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.445
No, uh... You don't understand.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.780
Uh, then maybe you should explain.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.909
First, I get a call from Mrs. Roth
telling me you failed a quiz,

08:54.993 --> 08:56.661
and now this?

08:56.745 --> 08:59.122
I'm sorry, Mother... Mom, I, uh...

08:59.205 --> 09:01.791
Harper, what is going on?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.626
I know you haven't been sleeping well.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.587
Or is it something at school?

09:06.338 --> 09:07.672
Baby, just talk to me.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.633
I wish I could.

09:11.843 --> 09:12.886
I can't.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.438
Dad, hey. Have you seen Topher around?

09:23.521 --> 09:25.482
Not since yesterday.
Have you asked the twins?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.276
- They're not in their rooms.
- Well, maybe check the springs.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.987
- The springs?
- Yeah.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.824
Yeah, I found this crazy-looking rock
in the water earlier and gave it to them.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.785
They're probably down there
looking for more.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.454
- Crazy-looking rock, huh?
- Yeah, I was kind of hoping

09:39.537 --> 09:42.499
it'd be a distraction from ghost-busting,
but I guess we'll…

09:45.043 --> 09:46.127
see.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.423
Just tell me where it is, okay?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.592
Haven't you ever heard of
"finders keepers"?

09:52.676 --> 09:54.928
Come on, you didn't find anything.
Dad gave it to you.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.805
Exactly. Which makes it mine.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.599
Ours.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.227
- Why do you want it so bad?
- I just...

10:03.019 --> 10:04.312
I just do, okay?

10:04.396 --> 10:07.273
- Must be really valuable.
- Definitely alien.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.317
And don't even think about looking for it,

10:09.401 --> 10:11.319
because I found the ultimate hiding place.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.780
If you want your own,
why don't you come in and look for it?

10:13.863 --> 10:16.282
Because I'm running out of time,
that's why!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.663
Whatever. Let's keep looking.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.048
Great news!
Wyatt and Zoey have the crystal.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.551
That's wonderful!
So, they'll give it to you, right?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.511
Clearly, you don't know
my brother and sister.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.555
No, they're hiding it somewhere.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.057
Oh, my. Any idea where?

10:42.225 --> 10:45.478
Not yet. But as soon as we find it,
we're heading straight to the bunker.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.772
- Meet me at The Tremont.
- I'll be right there.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.696
Everything the judge said is right here.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.032
Man of his word.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.578
- You okay with this, Daisy?
- No, I'm not!

11:02.370 --> 11:05.665
Please don't sign, Papa.
This land is all we have left of Mother.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.208
Sam, listen to me.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.046
Your mother's always gonna be
with us wherever we go.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.213
You know that, right?

11:12.297 --> 11:14.382
Then why does this feel so wrong?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.562
- I know this is hard but...
- Why should I believe anything you say?

11:27.645 --> 11:31.107
Because I'm telling the truth.
If Papa doesn't sign those papers...

11:32.108 --> 11:34.486
Remember that vision
I was telling you about?

11:34.569 --> 11:36.446
- Yeah.
- I've been having more of them.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.823
And each time, it's been about a fire.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.868
Someone's going to burn down
our home, Sam. I can feel it.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.328
Who?

11:43.912 --> 11:45.497
Judge Walker?

11:45.580 --> 11:48.333
Remember the other day when
he hinted that something could go wrong?

11:48.416 --> 11:49.417
Some kind of accident.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.711
- You really think he'd...
- Yes!

11:51.795 --> 11:54.047
That's why I need you to trust me on this.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.846
So what's the big wire for?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.890
Power. Lots of it.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.435
Yeah, just hoping
it doesn't overload the capacitor bank.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.978
It's been an issue in the past.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.563
Cool.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.108
- Hey, Sam.
- Yeah?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.402
Do you hate it here?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.907
Now, why would you ask me
a question like that?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.827
I guess I just know what it's like
to wanna run away.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.038
- And you are building this machine.
- So you think I wanna run away too?

12:27.664 --> 12:28.665
Am I right?

12:30.750 --> 12:31.835
I used to.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.628
Studied hard.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.046
Got an engineering degree

12:35.630 --> 12:37.632
and a big job lined up in Boston.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.135
So, why did you come back?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.595
The springs.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.308
After my mother got sick,
she used to soak in them for hours.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.813
Believed they had healing properties that
came from these little guys right here.

12:51.896 --> 12:52.897
So it's true?

12:52.981 --> 12:54.566
The crystal has magical powers?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.693
Energy.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.904
It didn't save her life,
but it might have extended it.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.615
Now I'm trying to use it
to power this contraption.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.744
I dedicated the last 18 years to it.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.412
Wow.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.915
So where are you gonna go
when it finally works?

13:10.999 --> 13:12.250
Far into the future,

13:12.334 --> 13:15.003
to a time where
they had a cure for what took her.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.504
And, with any luck,

13:17.213 --> 13:19.424
that crystal might save her life yet.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.389
So, what do you say?
You want to give it another try?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.319
Oh, my gosh! It's working!

13:41.488 --> 13:42.864
Ah!

13:53.291 --> 13:54.959
How much longer is this going to take?

13:55.043 --> 13:58.046
I've got five cases of melting Nutt-O Bars
in the Deepfreeze.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.631
Any minute, Miss Caroline.

14:00.632 --> 14:01.883
And you.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.469
How many times have I told you
to stay out of this man's hair?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.471
What? I'm helping!

14:06.554 --> 14:08.014
The best assistant I ever had.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.975
Well, she's the only assistant I ever had.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.164
Might be good for her to learn
the ins and outs of this place, you know,

14:15.188 --> 14:17.524
in case I'm not around one of these days.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.192
Now, Sam, why would she do that?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.194
It's not like you're leaving anytime soon.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.373
I appreciate the hospitality, Elijah.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.667
Beignets were as delicious as always.

14:36.251 --> 14:40.171
Least we can do, considering how much
you're helping us out with the farm.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.090
I like to assist when I can.

14:44.259 --> 14:47.846
So, what do you say
we get down to business?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.895
Everything all right?

14:57.897 --> 15:00.608
Everything's fine, Judge. Just fine.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.182
Come on. We have to hurry
if we're gonna find the crystal

15:15.206 --> 15:16.976
before Wyatt and Zoey
get back from the springs.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.376
Any idea where it could be?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.962
No, but it can't be that hard to find.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.298
I mean, Wyatt's hiding spots
tend to be kinda lame.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.055
Topher?

15:30.138 --> 15:31.389
Uh. Oh!

15:31.473 --> 15:33.641
Hey, guys. What's up?

15:39.022 --> 15:40.190
What're you doing here?

15:40.273 --> 15:43.026
Me? What are you doing here?

15:43.985 --> 15:44.986
I live here.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.905
Okay. Valid point.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.573
Th-This place is a mess!

15:49.824 --> 15:51.368
What're you looking for?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.788
I... Why were you going through my closet?

15:54.871 --> 15:56.122
Don't change the subject.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.501
You told me you were sleepwalking
last night. What were you really doing?

15:59.584 --> 16:01.920
Uh, could you rephrase
the question, please?

16:02.003 --> 16:03.588
- Topher!
- Fine!

16:05.340 --> 16:08.051
I took the crystal,
but it was a huge mistake.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.511
That thing is cursed!

16:09.594 --> 16:10.887
Cursed?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.932
Weird things kept happening.
We need to put it back where it belongs.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.183
That's what we want too.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.851
Then we're all out of luck.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.312
I've been through this whole room,
and it's not here.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.731
- So, then let's check Wyatt's room.
- Not in there either.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.859
I have a lot of cleaning up to do.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.446
So what do we do now?

16:28.530 --> 16:29.572
I don't know.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.827
Oh, a long day, huh?

16:33.910 --> 16:36.913
Yeah. Would've been a lot longer
without that crew you hired.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.957
You sure you don't want to ice that ankle?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.959
Oh, no, it's just a scrape. It's fine.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.214
Hey, listen, Dad, um,

16:47.924 --> 16:51.302
sorry if I didn't seem
more appreciative earlier.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.140
It means a lot to me
that we're doing this together.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.177
That's good to hear, Bennett.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.315
Now we just have to figure out
a way to brighten up this old firetrap.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.984
- Yeah.
- It's depressing.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.363
Whoa!

17:13.742 --> 17:15.201
What was that?

17:15.285 --> 17:16.661
Probably another power surge.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.955
I have to get that contractor
before he leaves.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.791
This place is a disaster.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.676
This doesn't make any sense.
There should be more than enough power.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.471
Maybe try another cable.
There's more in the barn.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.641
No, no, it just...
It just doesn't work, that's all. I...

17:39.225 --> 17:40.602
I should've known better.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.521
But you can't give up. Harper needs us!

17:43.605 --> 17:45.607
- Your sister needs...
- There's no point!

17:51.112 --> 17:53.448
I'm sorry, okay?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.992
Look, it's not your fault.
You... You're a kid.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.205
I guess I just wanted to believe
that crazy imagination of yours.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.706
Sam, please!

18:01.790 --> 18:02.791
No.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.251
No, your mother's right.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.799
From now on, just stay out of my hair.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.891
Why won't you work?

18:28.566 --> 18:29.943
I'm on my way, Harper.

18:37.867 --> 18:38.868
Ah!

19:00.515 --> 19:01.516
Savannah!

19:01.599 --> 19:04.185
Got your note.
Figured you could use a lift home.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.520
I can't believe it's you!

19:05.603 --> 19:08.440
And I can't believe you got stuck here!
What have you been doing?

19:08.523 --> 19:11.234
Pretending to be my great-grandmother.
It's been so crazy.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.194
I cooked this terrible dinner,
I milked a goat,

19:13.278 --> 19:16.865
then I kept having these visions of this
horrible judge burning down the house.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.034
Whoa! You milked a goat?

19:19.701 --> 19:20.702
Yes, an actual goat.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.871
Did you not hear the part
about the visions?

19:25.582 --> 19:26.750
Oh, no.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.586
- What is it?
- I don't know, but go now.

19:32.339 --> 19:36.259
Papa, something's happening.
I really think you should come out here.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.523
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.401
Something I can help you with?

19:53.485 --> 19:54.486
Elijah Tremont?

19:55.403 --> 19:56.613
Yes.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.741
According to your agreement
with Judge Emmett Walker,

19:59.824 --> 20:03.328
you are hereby ordered to vacate
this property within 48 hours.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.706
Vacate?

20:06.790 --> 20:09.167
No, no, Sheriff,
there must be some mistake.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.752
The judge and I have an agreement.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.629
And that agreement's in your hand.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.549
If I was you, I'd start packing now.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.277
Think. Where else could it be?

20:36.903 --> 20:40.699
I don't know, but Zoey and Wyatt
are going to be back any minute.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.793
Hey, uh, Topher? I just had an idea.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.130
Uh, do you think you could go down
and stall the twins for a bit?

20:55.213 --> 20:56.881
You know, give us more time to search?

20:56.965 --> 20:58.425
I guess so. Sure.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.014
I can't do this anymore, Griffin.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.266
Every time I think we're close,
something happens.

21:06.349 --> 21:09.728
I might as well accept it.
I am never going home.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.272
Actually, I think you might.

21:13.898 --> 21:14.899
What do you mean?

21:14.983 --> 21:18.069
I mean, I think
I'm sitting on Wyatt's hiding place.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.621
Oh, my goodness!

21:28.705 --> 21:31.207
I've never been so happy
to see anything in my whole life!

21:31.291 --> 21:32.500
Me either. I...

21:33.877 --> 21:35.295
- Is that a crack?
- A crack?

21:35.378 --> 21:36.963
This jagged line right here.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.340
That wasn't there before?

21:38.423 --> 21:40.216
No, it wasn't.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.806
Next time on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

21:46.890 --> 21:49.059
Your family can't let
that slimy judge win.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.477
We have to stop him.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.355
- Got the document for their farm?
- If you mean the original.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.358
- I'm not sure I can leave.
- What? No! You have to switch back.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.318
This is new.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.321
It's the ghost
sending a message loud and clear.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.448
Put the rock back now…

22:03.531 --> 22:04.741
Oh, god! No!

22:04.824 --> 22:06.409
- …or else.
- Fire!

22:06.493 --> 22:08.661
Savannah! Are you down there?
