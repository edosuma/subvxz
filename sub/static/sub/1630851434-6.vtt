00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:15.000 --> 00:16.458
Do you know where Antonio is?

00:17.333 --> 00:19.166
Over there with those people.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.625
Which one of you is Antonio?

00:26.375 --> 00:27.958
-Are you Antonio?
-Yes, that's me.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.333
-Hey!
-You piece of shit!

00:31.416 --> 00:32.458
Are you trying to frame me?

00:32.541 --> 00:34.458
You sent your daughter? You asshole!

00:35.666 --> 00:37.208
Come on, try it now!

00:37.833 --> 00:39.708
Stop it!

00:39.791 --> 00:41.333
Hey, that's enough!

00:43.875 --> 00:44.791
What's your problem?

00:44.875 --> 00:47.375
Don't you dare try
to manipulate my family again.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.958
Look, you've got the wrong guy.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.458
What's going on here?

00:55.708 --> 00:56.958
Hey, I know you.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.125
You're the woman with the cat.

01:00.833 --> 01:03.125
How long have you had your sights on us?

01:03.208 --> 01:04.458
No.

01:05.416 --> 01:06.791
What the fuck are you after?

01:09.250 --> 01:12.083
Here's the bitch who's going around
saying she's my daughter.

01:12.166 --> 01:13.375
What the fuck?

01:13.458 --> 01:18.375
Are you in some kind of trouble?
Did you try to scam these people?

01:21.625 --> 01:23.125
You really have no idea?

01:26.250 --> 01:27.333
About what?

01:27.416 --> 01:30.916
-You really have no idea.
-And I asked you not to tell him.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.625
Get out of here! Go!

01:34.375 --> 01:35.541
Shame on you.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.500
Why…

01:45.333 --> 01:47.416
did you tell him you're his daughter?

01:52.958 --> 01:54.250
Because I am.

01:55.125 --> 01:56.166
What do you mean?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.625
Miranda?

02:03.416 --> 02:06.083
I'm so sorry, Antonio. I can explain.

02:11.750 --> 02:12.708
Dad!

02:28.541 --> 02:31.041
So, ladies and gentlemen,
that's it for tonight.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.833
But don't worry, we'll be back.

02:32.916 --> 02:35.791
Let's thank our orchestra,
our three contestants,

02:35.875 --> 02:37.500
Sandro Ralli, of course,

02:37.583 --> 02:39.625
and all of you watching from home tonight.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.333
See you on the next episode of Musicherò!

02:42.416 --> 02:44.166
Bravo!

02:51.250 --> 02:52.458
Giggi.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.375
Thank you, Sandro.

02:57.375 --> 03:00.208
-You were amazing.
-Thank you so much, really.

03:00.291 --> 03:03.791
Giggi, tonight you almost made me cry.
I'm serious. I want to talk to you.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.750
-About what?
-About your future.

03:07.875 --> 03:08.875
-Bravo.
-Thank you.

03:08.958 --> 03:11.625
-Good job. Bravo.
-Thank you so much.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.500
Wonderful, Giggi.

03:14.583 --> 03:15.958
-Unexpected success.
-Thanks.

03:16.041 --> 03:18.833
-Sandro, can we talk for a moment, please?
-Of course.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.291
-We'll talk.
-Excuse us.

03:21.166 --> 03:24.041
-Is that your agent?
-Yes. She's a very balanced person.

03:25.416 --> 03:27.833
-So how was I?
-Good! Great!

03:27.916 --> 03:29.291
What do you want?

03:29.375 --> 03:32.166
So you and Giggi are best buddies now?

03:32.250 --> 03:33.583
Why? Is that a problem?

03:33.666 --> 03:36.291
-Who are those other two?
-I don't know. Friends of his.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.583
You're exposing yourself too much.

03:38.666 --> 03:40.958
You're the one who told me
to act normally.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.583
Yes, but things have changed.

03:42.666 --> 03:45.166
I shouldn't be telling you this.
Someone saw you.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
-Saw what?
-You know what I mean.

03:48.083 --> 03:51.791
I'm taking care of it, but until
it's fixed, careful who you hang out with.

03:51.875 --> 03:55.500
Tell me the truth.
Are they going to send me to jail?

03:55.583 --> 03:58.041
No, because I have friends we can trust.

03:58.625 --> 04:02.416
And these friends we can trust,
what's their price?

04:03.041 --> 04:05.750
You think
making someone disappear is cheap?

04:08.208 --> 04:12.333
Disappear? You mean buy them off,
not disappear, right?

04:12.416 --> 04:14.833
I know it might seem strange
to people like us,

04:15.333 --> 04:17.666
but not everyone can be bought.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.833
I have to talk to her.

04:30.125 --> 04:32.458
-If she really is Adele, I swear, I'll…
-Mom.

04:32.541 --> 04:34.375
Don't worry. We'll fix everything.

04:34.458 --> 04:36.291
Don't treat me like an idiot!

04:37.541 --> 04:38.916
Why didn't you tell me?

04:39.708 --> 04:42.625
Because I had promised her.
She said she needed time.

04:42.708 --> 04:44.791
You should've told me anyway!

04:48.291 --> 04:50.666
But I let you meet her,
you spent time together.

04:50.750 --> 04:55.208
Oh, sure! Over a cup of tea,
like two perfect strangers! Oh, please!

04:55.291 --> 04:57.791
I didn't want her to hate me, Mom!

04:58.500 --> 04:59.916
Good evening, everyone!

05:01.500 --> 05:02.916
So? How was I?

05:05.833 --> 05:07.166
Where is my fan club?

05:11.416 --> 05:12.708
What's going on?

05:13.375 --> 05:14.416
A nightmare.

05:14.916 --> 05:16.416
A real nightmare, darling.

05:18.791 --> 05:19.833
Mom.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.625
Was I that bad?

05:31.958 --> 05:33.208
Dad, open up!

05:33.708 --> 05:35.875
Antonio, open this door

05:35.958 --> 05:37.500
or I will break it down!

05:38.083 --> 05:39.291
Antonio!

05:40.208 --> 05:41.250
Open the door!

05:42.125 --> 05:44.083
Enough, already. Stop it.

05:44.166 --> 05:47.375
It's understandable.
Let him cool off. Trust me, he will.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.291
-Mind your business.
-It is my business.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.875
You let my brother believe
he had a daughter

05:52.958 --> 05:54.291
and let him give up his freedom.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.916
-It's not like that.
-How is it, then?

05:57.625 --> 05:59.458
-Witch!
-I'll smash your face in!

05:59.541 --> 06:02.083
-Grandma, calm down.
-You're pathetic.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.666
Everyone knows who you really are now.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.333
Shut up.

06:08.416 --> 06:09.500
Shut up!

06:09.583 --> 06:10.708
She's crazy.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.750
It's my fault. I'm the one
who told her to speak to her father,

06:24.833 --> 06:26.666
that it would be all right.

06:27.916 --> 06:30.291
But if Tullio went there,
Nora must be devastated.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.458
I guess so.

06:31.541 --> 06:34.958
My Mom stayed up until dawn.
She wanted to know everything.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.916
I'd have liked to know too.
Why didn't you tell me about Nora?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.125
I made a promise!

06:39.208 --> 06:41.791
She's my twin sister.
Why can't anybody understand that?

06:41.875 --> 06:43.500
Twin sister, my ass. It's a scam.

06:43.583 --> 06:44.750
No, Giggi, it's not.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.583
What can we do?

06:47.083 --> 06:48.125
You're asking me?

06:48.625 --> 06:50.458
I was the only one who didn't know.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.958
-Matteo, please, don't get mad.
-No.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.083
I won't. Just give me a minute, okay?

06:55.166 --> 06:56.333
We didn't mean it!

06:57.125 --> 06:58.125
Let me talk to him.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.291
-What a drag!
-Matteo!

07:05.375 --> 07:06.791
Matteo, wait!

07:17.541 --> 07:19.291
Will you stop for a moment?

07:23.583 --> 07:24.500
What?

07:25.125 --> 07:27.875
Come on.
This isn't the time to start fighting.

07:27.958 --> 07:29.875
She's my fiancée and she doesn't trust me.

07:29.958 --> 07:33.041
That's not true. She'd just promised Nora
she wouldn't tell anyone.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.708
Please, make up with her.
Don't let me carry this burden too!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.666
Of course we will.

07:40.916 --> 07:43.458
It's just awful
to feel left out like that.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.708
-By you as well.
-What did I do?

07:45.791 --> 07:46.916
Oh really?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.500
So why don't you tell me the truth
about Sandro Ralli?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.291
Exactly. There you go.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.583
What happened?
Everybody's looking for you.

08:09.666 --> 08:12.166
For you too.
People who better not find you.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.416
What have you done?

08:14.041 --> 08:16.250
-What are you talking about?
-They want you dead.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.791
Is there a place where you can hide?

08:18.875 --> 08:20.250
No, I…

08:20.333 --> 08:22.250
-I don't know--
-Listen. Look at me.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.416
Whatever you did,
are my kids involved too?

08:26.041 --> 08:28.000
-Only Nora.
-She's not my daughter.

08:29.416 --> 08:30.791
But if she's involved,

08:31.708 --> 08:33.125
go hide at the carnival.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.041
Don't ask anyone for help,
not even the police. Got it?

08:36.666 --> 08:38.375
How do you know all this stuff?

08:38.458 --> 08:41.166
No questions.
I'm putting everything on the line here.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.166
Listen,

08:46.833 --> 08:49.083
don't tell my family that you saw me here.

08:49.916 --> 08:51.500
I still have to fix a few things.

08:58.958 --> 09:00.958
-Coffee, Mom?
-Yes, honey.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.500
You and Adele were in the stroller.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.875
But it wasn't the nanny
who took you for a walk.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.791
In my dream, it was me.

09:11.791 --> 09:13.000
As it should have been.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.375
Suddenly, Adele undoes her belt
and jumps out of the stroller.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.250
I see her right away.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.875
I take her by the hand and hold her tight.

09:27.083 --> 09:31.666
She turns, looks at me and smiles
with those cute little teeth.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.541
-Mom.
-Thanks, honey.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.666
I hadn't had this dream in years.

09:40.416 --> 09:41.416
Mom.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.833
Listen,

09:44.541 --> 09:46.583
there's something I didn't tell you.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.625
When the carnies found Adele,
she wasn't lost in the park.

09:51.708 --> 09:54.250
She was locked up in a basement,
all by herself.

09:55.541 --> 09:57.833
-What? That makes no sense.
-It does.

09:57.916 --> 10:00.291
Before she took her away,
her grandma saw a tall man

10:00.375 --> 10:02.666
with a cane lurking around the building.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.625
-Alfio?
-I think so.

10:05.416 --> 10:08.833
Did you see how Dad reacted
when I showed him the photo?

10:08.916 --> 10:11.750
-Dad?
-Honestly, I think Dad knows something.

10:11.833 --> 10:14.708
He's never hidden anything from me,
not about our daughter.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.750
Exactly. Dad is Dad, Rosa.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.833
Are we treating him like a stranger now?

10:18.916 --> 10:20.833
We can at least talk to him, Giggi.

10:48.958 --> 10:51.083
How could you not see this coming?

10:52.458 --> 10:55.791
You're the one paying me to pretend
I'm looking for your daughter,

10:56.750 --> 10:58.083
not to actually find her.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.416
Who are these people?

11:00.041 --> 11:01.541
I don't know. I have no idea.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.625
Do a real investigation this time, then.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.375
Find proof that this is a scam.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.625
These scumbags
must have a criminal record a mile long.

11:09.708 --> 11:11.541
Here's what you'll do now.

11:12.416 --> 11:14.458
You'll go home and get some rest.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.000
No way!
I'm going to the construction site.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.125
I don't want to deal with my family.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.458
-Sooner or later you'll have to.
-I know.

11:23.541 --> 11:25.458
That's why you have to get a move on.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.041
At least talk to Miranda.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.125
If she tricked you,
you have a right to know.

11:33.208 --> 11:36.375
No, nobody tricked me.
Don't you dare saying anything like that.

11:36.458 --> 11:39.250
They led you to believe
Nora is your daughter. It's monstrous.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.041
-I would've lost it.
-Exactly.

11:41.125 --> 11:41.958
What?

11:42.583 --> 11:44.416
Stella wasn't a monster.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.125
It was during the war.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.416
Anything was allowed.
It goes for us and it goes for them.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.166
Fuck, they made you raise
someone else's daughter.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.416
Shut up!

11:58.541 --> 11:59.541
Come on.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.958
Nora is mine.

12:17.041 --> 12:18.666
-There you go.
-Thank you.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.041
-I'll give them back.
-No. Tell me what's going on.

12:21.125 --> 12:23.458
-Last night--
-Later. I promise.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.375
Bye.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.125
Put these on.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.166
With those clothes of yours,
they'll spot you right away.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.041
I messed things up
and you're still helping me?

12:36.125 --> 12:37.458
I'm doing it for myself.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.125
You don't look like you can
withstand torture. You'd give me up.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.583
Oh, thanks!

12:44.125 --> 12:45.666
How are things with your dad?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.583
He doesn't want to see me.

12:49.541 --> 12:52.166
Insist. Stop wasting time with me.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.291
But I don't want to tell him the truth.

12:56.833 --> 13:00.375
And he doesn't want to hear it either.
That's why he's hiding.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.000
It's too late to hide, isn't it?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.250
I hope it's not too late for us too.

13:05.333 --> 13:09.166
Anyway, I think your new dad
is some kind of spy.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.666
I'm not surprised.
He's rich and a total asshole.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.708
But he took a risk, protecting me.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.333
-He probably needed something in return.
-Maybe.

13:18.416 --> 13:20.458
Ralli must really be untouchable.

13:23.666 --> 13:25.166
What if he's a spy too?

13:25.250 --> 13:28.125
If you read the newspapers these days,
everyone's a spy.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.333
Or spied on. Like us.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.083
-Good morning.
-Well?

13:35.041 --> 13:37.333
What's he doing here dressed like this?

13:37.416 --> 13:39.208
He's in trouble. We have to help him.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.333
Don't we have enough trouble as it is?

13:41.416 --> 13:44.708
Please, come on.
It's just for a little while.

13:45.833 --> 13:46.791
All right.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.833
We could use some help
at the shooting gallery.

13:50.916 --> 13:51.791
Thank you.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.333
The kid is at your place every day
and now he's gone?

13:55.416 --> 13:58.666
What about his parents?
You're buddies now, aren't you? Ask them.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.166
I did. They know nothing.

14:00.666 --> 14:01.958
He must've run away.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.833
That kid is hot-headed.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.125
But why don't you tell me what he did?

14:07.916 --> 14:10.500
Remember, before the war,
when I used to work for you?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.666
If I messed up the flooring,
you didn't pay me for the day.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.041
Of course not. I'm still that way.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.208
You were a good boss.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.833
Let me be a good one too.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.250
I don't have a boss.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.500
We all do.

14:27.041 --> 14:30.291
Without a chain of command,
all that is left is chaos.

14:30.375 --> 14:33.500
Right. During the war,
our chain of command worked really well!

14:33.583 --> 14:36.625
Hurry up and find the kid.
This is serious.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.500
Don't make me use what I know against you.

14:39.958 --> 14:41.458
So now you're blackmailing me?

14:43.291 --> 14:44.666
Do you want to lose it all?

14:45.833 --> 14:46.833
Your wife,

14:46.916 --> 14:48.000
your children,

14:49.541 --> 14:51.250
this beautiful sky to look at?

14:51.333 --> 14:53.416
After we've been friends for 20 years?

14:53.500 --> 14:56.750
You collaborate with the secret services
because we're friends?

14:56.833 --> 14:59.458
Not because I covered for you
when you killed your friend?

15:03.791 --> 15:05.041
Go.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.125
Thank you.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.791
What the fuck are you doing here?

15:10.875 --> 15:11.958
I'm helping him out.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.833
He doesn't look like he needs help.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.041
What's your problem?

15:15.125 --> 15:17.416
-She's the one who needs help.
-What are you doing?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.541
And I'm perfectly capable
of protecting her.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.541
Hey! Have you gone crazy?

15:25.083 --> 15:26.333
Stop it!

15:33.250 --> 15:34.666
All right, go ahead then.

15:45.958 --> 15:47.833
Giggi, where are you going?

15:47.916 --> 15:50.083
Listen, Mom's completely lost it.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.041
She wants to go to the carnival
to see Nora. Are you coming?

15:54.416 --> 15:55.375
No.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.083
No way.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.875
I think you've messed up enough already.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.791
What have I messed up?

16:01.875 --> 16:04.250
You just had to find your sister,
didn't you?

16:04.333 --> 16:07.416
Our sister. And what kind
of question is that? It's ridiculous.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.458
It's like she never existed, for you.

16:09.541 --> 16:10.833
And she did for you?

16:10.916 --> 16:13.625
I wasn't there, you were a baby.
What can you remember?

16:13.708 --> 16:15.541
How much it hurt Mom and Dad.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.250
No way, sweetheart.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.625
It's thanks to me that Mom and Dad
got back on their feet.

16:20.708 --> 16:23.583
Thanks to their happy son,
the always cheerful one!

16:23.666 --> 16:25.416
The family jokester is back!

16:26.666 --> 16:28.958
What? Didn't I make you laugh enough?

16:29.041 --> 16:30.958
How can you say such horrible things?

16:32.750 --> 16:35.541
Maybe it's time to change my act.

16:37.208 --> 16:40.833
Everything is unraveling
around here anyway. Can't you see it?

16:44.291 --> 16:45.583
What is Ralli doing here?

16:48.625 --> 16:49.875
We're going to an audition.

16:50.958 --> 16:53.333
No, Giggi, please. Tell him you're busy.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.416
Here?

16:57.458 --> 16:59.458
I don't have anything to do here.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.208
Easy! There's enough of me for everyone!

17:22.291 --> 17:24.083
That's the guy from Musicherò!

17:24.166 --> 17:26.208
Yes! It's Giggi Gabrielli! Go!

17:26.833 --> 17:28.750
Excuse me!

17:29.333 --> 17:30.791
Can you give me your autograph?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.125
Of course!

17:32.208 --> 17:33.708
What's your name, radiant beauty?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.791
-Franca.
-I bet you are.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.958
"To Franca." Shall I leave her
my phone number too, Sandro?

17:40.458 --> 17:41.625
Slow down, there!

17:42.666 --> 17:44.583
"To Franca. With love, Giggi."

17:44.666 --> 17:47.333
-There you go. The whole thing.
-Thank you!

17:47.416 --> 17:50.625
And now, let us through,
because we've got work to do.

17:50.708 --> 17:52.541
Bravo!

17:57.833 --> 17:58.708
Oh my God!

18:30.333 --> 18:31.750
Excuse us a second.

19:19.333 --> 19:20.416
Who's there?

19:31.833 --> 19:34.958
Don't move. Don't scream.
Nobody can hear you anyway.

19:36.250 --> 19:38.250
-Shut up! Shut up! Don't--
-Cut!

19:39.125 --> 19:42.375
Sandro, this is not working.
Unleash your rage.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.041
You have to attack her.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.166
Right. I'm sorry. Let me try again.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.666
Good. Try again.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.541
Sorry, would you mind spitting the gum?

19:49.625 --> 19:51.000
Go on. Let's do it again.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.750
Go on. Don't worry. Go.

19:59.708 --> 20:02.916
Don't move. Don't scream.
No one can hear you anyway!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.083
Why would I scream?

20:04.625 --> 20:07.041
He wouldn't even scare a baby!

20:07.125 --> 20:08.250
Cut.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.250
Sandro, I'll repeat it for you.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.708
You used to be a good kid,
but life in the big city has changed you.

20:14.791 --> 20:17.250
You've struggled
to keep your family alive,

20:17.333 --> 20:20.583
you've gone without food,
and she teases you and then rejects you.

20:20.666 --> 20:26.166
Do you understand? I want
your dark side to come out here.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.666
Dark side?

20:27.750 --> 20:30.000
I don't think he has a dark side.

20:32.208 --> 20:33.875
Don't worry. Go.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.583
Come on. Spit out that fucking gum.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.583
Spit that fucking gum out!

20:44.666 --> 20:46.208
You're not screaming now.

20:46.291 --> 20:47.666
-No one can hear you!
-Let go!

20:47.750 --> 20:50.958
You whore! What part of this
do you not understand, huh?

20:51.041 --> 20:53.541
Don't you like me?
Don't you like me anymore?

20:53.625 --> 20:56.916
How come? Am I too poor for you?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.125
Do I still stink like a beggar?

20:59.208 --> 21:00.166
Stop it!

21:00.250 --> 21:04.458
Eva, what the fuck are you doing?
You're improvising now?

21:04.541 --> 21:07.833
She's improvising!
We've got ourselves a diva!

21:12.416 --> 21:14.708
Son of a bitch.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.583
So where were you?

22:17.666 --> 22:19.333
-I was busy.
-With what?

22:20.958 --> 22:22.250
I met with Bartoli.

22:22.916 --> 22:24.916
I told him to look into those people.

22:25.833 --> 22:27.583
What happened at the carnival?

22:27.666 --> 22:28.791
Nothing.

22:29.375 --> 22:30.416
Nothing, Dad?

22:30.500 --> 22:32.458
I taught that carny a lesson, all right?

22:32.541 --> 22:34.000
A lesson? What kind of lesson?

22:34.083 --> 22:36.041
A caress with my fist closed!

22:36.125 --> 22:38.291
-I can't believe you, Dad!
-You be quiet!

22:38.375 --> 22:40.125
I want to talk to that girl.

22:40.708 --> 22:41.833
Absolutely not.

22:41.916 --> 22:44.625
We're not taking any initiative
until things are clear.

22:45.125 --> 22:46.833
I don't like your tone of voice.

22:46.916 --> 22:50.666
How can you be so sure she's not Adele?
If you know something, tell us.

22:50.750 --> 22:51.791
Please!

22:56.041 --> 22:58.250
There he is! Shoo!

22:59.208 --> 23:02.083
Shoo! You bastards! Shoo!

23:03.833 --> 23:05.375
Damn you!

23:07.375 --> 23:09.750
-Did you see more of them?
-More of what?

23:09.833 --> 23:11.791
Pigeons. In the windows. Today.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.583
Did you see other pigeons?

23:13.666 --> 23:15.250
-Answer me!
-No!

23:15.333 --> 23:18.000
Nobody move a finger.
We'll wait for Bartoli. Period.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.541
I set up the bed for you.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.583
Well, the sofa.

23:47.333 --> 23:49.125
I'm not tired anyway.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.041
Me neither.

24:00.666 --> 24:03.208
I was thinking, we should warn the others.

24:04.541 --> 24:06.625
Someone might look for them to get to me.

24:06.708 --> 24:09.166
Yes, but we should be careful
about the meeting place.

24:09.250 --> 24:11.125
They may already be following them.

24:16.041 --> 24:17.208
What a mess.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.958
Let's try to get some sleep. Come on.

24:49.000 --> 24:49.833
Nora?

24:53.791 --> 24:55.583
-What's wrong?
-Can I have a pillow?

25:05.125 --> 25:07.250
Because I was thinking…

25:09.458 --> 25:11.291
even though all around us

25:12.708 --> 25:14.791
everything is so screwed up…

25:17.416 --> 25:18.708
with me and you,

25:19.708 --> 25:21.375
right from the start…

25:23.708 --> 25:25.791
things always seem so…

25:27.125 --> 25:28.125
Simple?

25:30.250 --> 25:31.708
Simple.

26:37.750 --> 26:38.708
Stella?

26:45.250 --> 26:46.583
Stella, is that you?

26:51.750 --> 26:53.000
Who's there?

28:15.500 --> 28:17.625
Come with me, you piece of shit!

28:17.708 --> 28:19.208
-Ouch!
-Come here.

28:19.291 --> 28:20.500
Come here, you bastard!

28:22.000 --> 28:25.041
You son of a bitch!
Did you kill her? Who's that poor girl?

28:25.125 --> 28:27.083
There's a corpse buried in the park!

28:27.166 --> 28:29.291
Shut up!

28:29.375 --> 28:31.250
What the fuck are you doing?

28:31.333 --> 28:33.083
Don't touch me! I'll go tell Antonio.

28:33.166 --> 28:35.875
No, wait. You can't tell Antonio. Wait.

28:37.375 --> 28:40.041
The Grottas needed the land.
I gave it to them.

28:40.125 --> 28:43.125
I thought I was doing something good.
I didn't know about the girl.

28:43.208 --> 28:44.416
-Who's she?
-I don't know.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.791
But don't tell Antonio. I'll take care
of everything. I'm working on it.

28:47.875 --> 28:49.958
-Then get rid of the body.
-Okay.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.375
And give her a decent burial.

28:52.416 --> 28:54.666
Or I'll tell Antonio,
and you'll be done here.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.041
I'm doing you a favor.

28:57.125 --> 29:01.416
Remember that next time
you talk shit about me to your brother.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.666
They're all respectable people.

29:04.583 --> 29:07.833
That Antonio is some kind of legend,
like a hero.

29:07.916 --> 29:11.125
No criminal record, not a soul
who's got a bone to pick with him.

29:11.625 --> 29:15.083
The only thing that's fishy
are their ties with the Grotta brothers.

29:15.916 --> 29:18.458
-Do you remember the Grotta Circus?
-Never heard of it.

29:18.541 --> 29:21.291
Well, the Grotta brothers
are small-time crooks.

29:22.291 --> 29:25.083
They worked at the carnival,
but something must have happened

29:25.166 --> 29:27.166
because, suddenly, Antonio threw them out.

29:27.250 --> 29:29.541
Are they the ones who organized the scam?

29:29.625 --> 29:31.541
No! There's no proof it's a scam.

29:31.625 --> 29:33.750
-What are you saying?
-Listen to me.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.416
The Grotta brothers,

29:37.166 --> 29:40.000
they work for your friend, Minnella.

29:41.625 --> 29:42.791
And we both know

29:42.875 --> 29:45.375
that Minnella works
for the secret services.

29:45.458 --> 29:48.000
What? No way,
I've never heard anything about it!

29:48.083 --> 29:49.791
All I had to do was a little digging.

29:49.875 --> 29:53.458
No way! I would know! I've known Minnella
since he was a manual laborer.

29:53.541 --> 29:57.333
Minnella does the dirty work for the rich,
hiring thugs like the Grottas.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.083
So at one point, I asked myself,

30:01.166 --> 30:04.833
"If I were rich, filthy rich,
and my daughter disappeared,

30:04.916 --> 30:06.000
what would I do?"

30:07.208 --> 30:10.166
I'd call someone like me
to pretend I'm helping,

30:10.250 --> 30:12.833
and someone like Minnella to really help.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.958
What does this have to do
with the girl, anyway?

30:17.041 --> 30:18.500
I don't know. Nothing, maybe.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.875
But you know what?
For me, the case is closed.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.083
Because your daughter isn't dead.

30:23.583 --> 30:27.375
And if you believed that for 20 years,
it's because someone made you believe it.

30:34.500 --> 30:38.500
Postcards! Get your postcards!

30:38.583 --> 30:40.833
-Do you want a nice postcard?
-No. Thank you.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.708
-Peanuts!
-Get your postcards!

30:45.791 --> 30:46.666
Peanuts!

30:47.708 --> 30:48.833
Why are we here?

30:51.125 --> 30:53.833
-Because it's safer.
-What happened? Are you in danger?

30:53.916 --> 30:55.666
We all are now.

30:55.750 --> 30:58.958
Is that why you two are wearing
these ridiculous clothes?

30:59.041 --> 31:01.458
No, it's for my fans.
I don't want to be recognized.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.916
-Are you the guy from Musicherò?
-There you go.

31:04.458 --> 31:05.833
-Name? Brava.
-Anna.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.333
Thank you.

31:08.416 --> 31:11.708
Clothes, fans… You don't get it.
Sandro Ralli killed Gioia.

31:11.791 --> 31:13.291
The photos speak loud and clear.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.958
-I knew it. God damn it, Simone!
-Lower your voice!

31:16.916 --> 31:18.083
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.375
I should have told you.
You're right, I'm sorry.

31:20.458 --> 31:22.458
But I did it for you, to protect you.

31:22.541 --> 31:23.791
Did you go to the police?

31:23.875 --> 31:26.041
Yes, but I've only made things worse.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.791
It's as if I turned myself in.

31:28.833 --> 31:30.833
The secret service is protecting Ralli.

31:32.250 --> 31:36.041
He tricked me and I fell for it,
like a perfect idiot. I'm sorry.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.250
Don't worry.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.958
Why don't we try and,
I don't know, ask Dad for help?

31:40.041 --> 31:41.875
No, absolutely not.

31:41.958 --> 31:44.000
He's already helped enough.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.583
If Ralli has protection, I can speak
with the editor at the newspaper,

31:53.666 --> 31:55.500
convince him to start an investigation--

31:55.583 --> 31:57.708
No, we don't have time for that, Matteo!

31:58.750 --> 31:59.916
I'll take care of this.

32:01.416 --> 32:04.208
But I need your help.
Let's drop by your place.

32:04.291 --> 32:05.916
Why? What do you have in mind?

32:06.666 --> 32:07.750
Do you guys trust me?

32:07.833 --> 32:09.875
You two go back to hiding.
You come with me.

32:12.833 --> 32:13.958
Wait. Nora?

32:16.166 --> 32:19.000
I found out that Dad beat up your father.

32:19.541 --> 32:20.625
I'm sorry.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.625
And you were right. He's hiding something.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.166
-What?
-I don't know.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.000
But I promise I'll find out.

32:35.208 --> 32:36.791
Let's go. Come on.

32:37.666 --> 32:38.583
Come on.

32:45.666 --> 32:47.958
Postcards! Get your postcards!

32:59.416 --> 33:00.375
Esther.

33:01.541 --> 33:04.458
-Call the driver, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.416
I'm a mother.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.166
My instincts must be
worth something, right?

33:10.250 --> 33:11.958
Where would you like to go, ma'am?

33:17.666 --> 33:18.958
To the carnival.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.791
So cool!

33:22.875 --> 33:25.875
-Is Sandro Ralli here yet?
-I don't think so.

33:25.958 --> 33:28.208
-Can you get them front row seats?
-Of course.

33:28.291 --> 33:29.875
-Thank you.
-Guys, come with me.

33:32.583 --> 33:33.708
You can sit here.

33:35.583 --> 33:38.500
Excuse me? Can I have an autograph?

33:38.583 --> 33:39.875
Yes, of course.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.833
Can we have a kiss too?

33:57.916 --> 33:58.791
Thank you.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.916
It was short but sweet.

34:07.791 --> 34:10.125
I have to admit, I admire your brother.

34:11.458 --> 34:14.500
-I'm even a little afraid for him now.
-Yes. Me too.

34:14.583 --> 34:16.500
He acts like a clown,

34:17.250 --> 34:20.083
but in the end,
clowns always tell the truth, don't they?

34:22.541 --> 34:24.791
We wanted to grow up so bad, right?

34:25.791 --> 34:27.666
And everything's really up to us now.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.291
-Would you go back in time?
-No.

34:31.041 --> 34:33.166
I wouldn't have found my sister.

34:35.583 --> 34:37.916
Why didn't you tell me about her
when you found out?

34:38.541 --> 34:40.458
Because I promised her, Matteo.

34:41.041 --> 34:43.333
And I want to be
a woman who keeps her word.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.875
It's all that matters.

34:49.583 --> 34:50.916
Be quiet!

34:51.000 --> 34:52.250
You're a rat.

34:53.916 --> 34:55.500
I didn't say a word.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.916
So tell me,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.583
how the fuck did Miranda
find the body in all this land?

35:00.083 --> 35:01.750
She had some kind of premonition.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.333
-Yeah, right!
-Yes, she had a…

35:04.416 --> 35:05.833
And I'm Houdini!

35:07.541 --> 35:09.833
We'll take care of the body.
We'll get rid of it.

35:09.916 --> 35:11.916
But then we'll deal with you, Ettore.

35:12.583 --> 35:14.250
Leave my brother out of it.

35:14.333 --> 35:16.208
You should've thought about that earlier!

35:26.291 --> 35:28.125
-Canio, it's him.
-Who, Cesare?

35:28.625 --> 35:30.500
What do you mean? The petty bourgeois kid.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.500
The one we're looking for? From the photo?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.708
What do I always say?
What comes around goes around.

35:35.791 --> 35:37.041
Let's go, Canio.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.250
-Hi, Grandma.
-Hi.

35:39.333 --> 35:40.583
Good evening.

35:45.291 --> 35:47.291
-What can I do for you?
-Good evening.

35:48.666 --> 35:50.125
I'd like to talk to Nora.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.208
Wait, ma'am.

35:56.541 --> 35:58.250
First, we need to have a chat.

35:59.333 --> 36:01.708
Way to go! Good shot! Give that to me.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.250
I'll go get the picture for you.

36:07.375 --> 36:08.916
It's stuck.

36:09.416 --> 36:10.625
Just a sec. It's coming.

36:10.708 --> 36:12.833
Mom, why isn't he giving me my picture?

36:12.916 --> 36:14.791
Don't worry. The gypsy will get it.

36:14.875 --> 36:17.083
Sure!
The gypsy will take care of everything.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.291
What are you doing?

36:24.458 --> 36:26.166
Don't worry. I know how to fix it.

36:26.916 --> 36:29.416
Nice system. Simple, but ingenious.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.625
Who the fuck are you?

36:30.708 --> 36:32.166
A friend of Nora's.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.375
Simone Baldi.

36:34.083 --> 36:35.875
Oh, the "friend" we've heard about.

36:36.416 --> 36:38.291
I didn't know I was so famous.

36:41.083 --> 36:43.083
-Here's your picture. Bye.
-Thanks.

36:46.875 --> 36:47.791
Excuse me.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.875
I know it's none of my business,

36:52.666 --> 36:54.125
but your daughter's suffering.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.666
Stay out of it.

37:00.541 --> 37:01.916
She was one and a half.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.916
It's not her fault she got kidnapped.

37:05.750 --> 37:08.083
You're not the real victim here, Nora is.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.583
I don't know if I can take the truth.

37:10.666 --> 37:13.041
Truth and reality aren't the same thing.

37:13.125 --> 37:15.250
Nora told me you're an academic.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.416
Sorry, but I don't follow you.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.875
Let me give you an example.

37:20.833 --> 37:22.000
If one day

37:22.666 --> 37:24.791
I were to ask for Nora's hand in marriage,

37:25.791 --> 37:27.458
who do you think I would ask?

37:57.541 --> 37:59.583
I'm not mad at you. It's not your fault.

38:01.791 --> 38:04.541
Your mother always used to say
that you looked like me.

38:05.291 --> 38:07.000
"See? She has your smile."

38:07.083 --> 38:08.375
Dad,

38:09.208 --> 38:12.208
before you judge her,
you need to know what happened.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.375
I'll tell you everything I know.

38:14.958 --> 38:15.875
No.

38:16.625 --> 38:19.208
I want the whole truth,
and it has to come from Miranda.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.041
That's my daughter.

38:33.541 --> 38:34.458
Stella.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.666
She's the one who raised your child.

39:07.833 --> 39:09.208
This is all I have.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.416
I drew them.

39:14.416 --> 39:15.791
They don't even look like her.

39:21.208 --> 39:22.750
What I am trying to tell you…

39:25.250 --> 39:26.916
is that Nora had a mother.

39:29.041 --> 39:31.750
It may be hard to accept,
but you have to deal with it.

39:33.958 --> 39:36.125
Because not even Jesus Christ…

39:37.625 --> 39:39.666
was able to go back in time.

39:42.291 --> 39:44.875
I don't want you to ruin
my granddaughter's life.

39:52.541 --> 39:54.041
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:54.125 --> 39:57.333
good evening and welcome
to the musical game show of the year.

39:57.416 --> 39:59.000
This is Musicherò!

40:03.625 --> 40:06.000
As usual, we're here
with our radiant orchestra,

40:06.083 --> 40:08.791
and the even more radiant Claudia,

40:08.875 --> 40:11.166
and our three very lively contestants!

40:11.250 --> 40:12.333
Here they are!

40:12.416 --> 40:15.875
And here at Musicherò,
for the second time, our guest star.

40:15.958 --> 40:18.833
Ladies and gentlemen, Sandro Ralli!

40:21.500 --> 40:24.166
Thank you, Sandro.
You can get to your position now.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.666
A little more to the side, please.

40:26.750 --> 40:30.083
Tonight's show
is going to be unforgettable.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.166
Unforgettable, because it's special.

40:32.250 --> 40:34.875
After all,
everything's special here at Musicherò,

40:34.958 --> 40:38.208
inside this little magic box
called television.

40:38.291 --> 40:41.000
From here, I can see everything,
I can get anywhere.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.333
So…

40:42.416 --> 40:44.833
I've decided to show you some evidence.

40:44.916 --> 40:46.708
But there's no music involved,

40:46.791 --> 40:48.916
as you might mistakenly assume. No.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.041
I'll show you evidence of a murder.

40:54.250 --> 40:55.916
It's the only way I know

40:56.708 --> 40:58.458
to make sure justice is served.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.166
Do you recognize him?

41:02.875 --> 41:04.375
He's crazy.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.875
It's a quiz, so you'd have to guess.

41:09.041 --> 41:09.875
No?

41:10.375 --> 41:13.958
Strange, because the answer
is right here before your eyes.

41:15.125 --> 41:16.291
He's a friend of mine.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.375
Or at least I thought he was.

41:19.458 --> 41:21.208
-Shut it down!
-Get us off the air!

41:27.125 --> 41:29.416
I'm home! Sorry I'm late, love!

41:30.208 --> 41:31.916
Has the show started already?

41:32.708 --> 41:33.958
Lucia?

41:35.208 --> 41:36.583
Where's everybody?

41:37.333 --> 41:38.541
What about the show?

41:40.708 --> 41:42.250
Is the television broken?

41:42.750 --> 41:43.750
What's going on?

41:45.500 --> 41:47.166
Esther, where's my wife?

41:47.250 --> 41:50.375
-She went out.
-What do you mean, "She went out"?

41:50.458 --> 41:51.583
Where did she go?

41:52.208 --> 41:53.333
To the carnival.

41:55.708 --> 41:58.041
You'll see,
your dad will talk to your grandma

41:58.125 --> 41:59.875
and he'll come to terms with it.

42:00.916 --> 42:04.291
In the end, if you think about it,
she and your mom saved your life.

42:04.375 --> 42:07.333
What did you say to him
to convince him to come talk to me?

42:07.416 --> 42:09.291
I can't reveal my secrets.

42:10.750 --> 42:13.250
Careful,
you're starting to talk like a carny.

42:13.875 --> 42:16.125
Welcome! One full cartridge, five lire.

42:16.208 --> 42:17.916
-Three boxes--
-They're my cousins.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.250
Be quiet and come with us.

42:21.958 --> 42:23.333
Let's go grab a coffee.

42:25.166 --> 42:26.458
Come on. Let's go.

42:35.250 --> 42:38.208
-I think they're here for you.
-I thought they were your cousins.

42:38.291 --> 42:39.708
Nice family, huh?

42:40.416 --> 42:41.333
Run!

42:43.583 --> 42:44.958
Let's go, Canio!

43:00.583 --> 43:01.458
Excuse us!

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Sorry!

43:08.500 --> 43:09.750
Let's go! Come on!

43:13.166 --> 43:15.125
If we built that thing…

43:17.125 --> 43:18.250
Let's go!

43:24.791 --> 43:28.083
-Didn't I tell you to stay home?
-You stay at home.

43:28.166 --> 43:30.291
Too many emotions are bad for you.

43:31.833 --> 43:35.375
I could feel that Adele was alive,
that I was right.

43:35.458 --> 43:37.250
You know what's bad for me?

43:38.833 --> 43:40.791
Keeping these emotions bottled up inside.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.291
Out of fear.

43:43.375 --> 43:46.625
Fear of looking like
a crazy person, a lunatic.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.916
And you know
who makes me feel like that? You do!

43:51.000 --> 43:53.166
You discourage me because it's convenient!

43:53.250 --> 43:56.541
But I want to get to know my daughter now.

43:58.500 --> 44:00.708
And if you're not okay with that, my love,

44:01.750 --> 44:02.875
it's your problem.

44:07.125 --> 44:08.833
No! Wait for the next one!

44:08.916 --> 44:10.583
I was here first!

44:10.666 --> 44:12.416
Did you see that?

44:13.833 --> 44:14.916
Go, Canio.

44:42.208 --> 44:43.208
No!

44:45.666 --> 44:47.333
What the fuck are they doing here?

44:47.416 --> 44:48.875
Assholes.

45:03.041 --> 45:04.583
Is this thing safe?

45:06.375 --> 45:07.625
No!

45:32.875 --> 45:35.875
