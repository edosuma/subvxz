<i>¶ O, Hamilton, I sing of thee ¶</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:03.162
<i>¶ Hamilton, all</i>
<i>praise to thee ¶</i>

01:04.931 --> 01:09.668
<i>¶ though life may take</i>

01:11.171 --> 01:15.908

01:17.911 --> 01:24.083
<i>¶ Hamilton, o, Hamilton ¶</i>

01:24.085 --> 01:28.687
<i>¶ your hallowed walls</i>

01:31.458 --> 01:37.629
<i>¶ Hamilton, o, Hamilton ¶</i>

01:37.631 --> 01:42.434

01:45.038 --> 01:49.808

<i>you'll always be ¶</i>

01:58.651 --> 02:03.388

02:12.465 --> 02:18.737
<i>¶ Hamilton, o, Hamilton ¶</i>

02:18.739 --> 02:23.475
<i>¶ a beacon shining</i>
<i>for your fellow man ¶</i>

02:26.279 --> 02:32.184
<i>¶ Hamilton, o, Hamilton ¶</i>

02:32.186 --> 02:36.989

03:07.020 --> 03:10.122
He honestly doesn't seem
to like you, finstock.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.126
He loves me. Do you know why?

03:16.029 --> 03:20.232
He loves me because
I'm his master.

03:20.234 --> 03:23.168
He knows I will protect him...

03:23.170 --> 03:25.204
Like the students here
at Hamilton university.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.371
Sit!

03:29.976 --> 03:32.511
They know why I'm here.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.380
Finstock, do you
know why you're here?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.716
Oh, uh, yes, sir. $32,500
a year and summers off.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.986
You're here because it's time

03:40.988 --> 03:43.155
to bring the glory
back to this institution.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.189
The regional boxing finals

03:44.191 --> 03:46.024
are in 3 months.

03:46.026 --> 03:50.229
Now, you and I
have a sacred oath

03:50.231 --> 03:51.863
to provide these young people

03:51.865 --> 03:53.699
with an opportunity

03:53.701 --> 03:55.901
to develop not
only their minds,

03:55.903 --> 03:57.903
but their spirit as well.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.404
Their fighting spirit.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.206
Heh heh!

04:01.208 --> 04:02.474
Am I right?

04:03.610 --> 04:05.344
I promised the alumni

04:05.346 --> 04:06.878
I'd give 'em a
winning boxing team,

04:06.880 --> 04:09.448
and all you've given me
is this... this Todd Howard.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.583
The only thing he ever
did on an athletic field

04:11.585 --> 04:13.785
was to play in the school band.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.254
Clarinet, looks like.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.360
Can I make a sudden move?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.199
Oh, yeah, that's
the kid. I know him.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.768
Uh, his cousin Scott played basketball
for me down at beacontown high.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.736
And?

04:30.738 --> 04:31.737
And what?

04:31.739 --> 04:32.804
And what? And what?

04:33.072 --> 04:35.540
What?

04:35.542 --> 04:36.742
Well, oh, and uh, I don't think
Scott knew the first thing

04:36.744 --> 04:39.645
about playing
the, uh, clarinet.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.580
I gave that kid
a full scholarship

04:41.582 --> 04:43.382
based on your recommendation!

04:43.384 --> 04:44.883
On my recommendation?

04:44.885 --> 04:46.051
That's great!

04:46.053 --> 04:47.085
Finstock!

04:47.087 --> 04:47.886
What?

04:49.255 --> 04:50.422
Your job is riding

04:50.424 --> 04:52.090
on this boxing team!

04:52.092 --> 04:53.558
My reputation as an educator

04:53.560 --> 04:55.327
is riding on this boxing team!

05:00.967 --> 05:02.401
And all you've brought me

05:02.403 --> 05:04.136
is a clarinet player?

05:04.138 --> 05:05.237
Hmm?

05:05.239 --> 05:06.305
I think it's that way.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.273
Ok, 3 blocks?

05:08.275 --> 05:09.308
Todd! Todd!

05:10.944 --> 05:12.277
All right. Thanks a lot.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.412
Bye. Bye.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.946
Come on, Todd! Let's go.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.348
Excuse me!
Whoa, whoa, watch out!

05:17.650 --> 05:20.485
Ok, she said the dorm
was past the quad

05:20.487 --> 05:23.088
and left after the
administration building.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.824
Or was it right?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.693
That's ok. We'll just
keep going straight.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.769
I know how you feel.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.372
College is a stressful time,

05:40.374 --> 05:43.308
especially on your first day.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.610
I mean, it's... it's
stressful for anyone,

05:47.046 --> 05:49.948
even for people without
your particular worry.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.985
What worry?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.120
You know.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.527
I don't believe it!

06:03.363 --> 06:04.563
Whoa!

06:05.231 --> 06:06.431
Absolutely...

06:08.034 --> 06:10.902
I hate it when you do that.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.971
I'm not ashamed of
who or what I am,

06:12.973 --> 06:14.473
and you shouldn't be, either.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.708
Well, I'm not, because
it skipped my family.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.581
No, look, I've got
enough problems, ok?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.549
I'm here at a new school,

06:24.551 --> 06:26.551
it's the first time I've
lived away from home,

06:26.553 --> 06:28.653
I gotta make new friends,
I gotta try to fit in

06:28.655 --> 06:29.815
without this hanging over me.

06:35.828 --> 06:38.864
Well, it is true that sometimes
it skips family members.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.467
Your mother and father
aren't werewolves.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.502
But if I were you,

06:43.504 --> 06:46.605
I'd, uh, keep my
possibilities open.

06:52.378 --> 06:53.612
Uncle Harold,

06:53.614 --> 06:55.080
can you please change back

06:55.082 --> 06:56.915
before we get to the dorm?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.584
Thanks.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.791
I think the dorm is just a
little north from here.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.926
Watch out!

07:11.030 --> 07:13.365
¶

07:13.367 --> 07:18.303
<i>¶ She's a little deceiver,</i>
<i>couldn't believe her ¶</i>

07:18.305 --> 07:22.407
excuse me, I think that
this was our space.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.975
Are you talking to me?

07:23.977 --> 07:25.444
Uh, no, but...

07:26.145 --> 07:27.546
I'd like to...

07:27.548 --> 07:29.181
Maybe give you a call.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.722
Gus, he says this is his space.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.691
A freshman.

07:42.094 --> 07:44.629
Did you think I said
that this is my space?

07:44.631 --> 07:47.098
Um, I didn't say that, no.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.000
This is your space.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.936
Um, my space has got a couple
of yellow lines on it.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.071
I brought my Uncle by
to see your space,

07:53.073 --> 07:55.740
'cause it was, um,
such a nice one.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.642
And now, since you're
in your space,

07:58.578 --> 08:00.378
we'll go get in ours.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.786
They seem like nice kids.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.668
Yeah, I think I saw another
space up the street.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.938
Todd?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.173
Buddy, how are you?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.041
Come on in.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.343
Drop your stuff off.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.544
Make yourself at home.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.280
Do I, um... Do I know you?

08:36.283 --> 08:37.482
Stiles.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.116
We're roommates.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.284
Ok.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.119
Stiles?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.386
Mr. h?

08:43.456 --> 08:44.489
Stiles!

08:44.491 --> 08:45.857
Mr. h!

08:45.859 --> 08:47.359
How's the prince of paint?

08:47.361 --> 08:49.060
What are you doing here?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.829
Took some doing, but
I've got connections.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.163
You know, daughter
of somebody...

08:52.165 --> 08:53.965
Let me just tidy up a bit.

08:57.136 --> 08:58.403
It's a great room, huh?

08:58.405 --> 09:01.339
I decorated it myself.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.208
Well, what do you think?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.710
You're in the big
time, kid... college.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.479
No one telling you what to do.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.648
No more picking up your
stuff if you don't want to.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.982
No parents.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.517
No offense, Mr. h.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.818
Let me help you with that.

09:20.326 --> 09:21.259
Todd?

09:21.761 --> 09:22.727
Yeah?

09:24.096 --> 09:25.564
I got to get back
to beacontown.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.865
Could you walk me to the van?
Sure.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.533
Hey, Mr. H.,
everything's kosher.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.035
I've taken care of everything.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.270
I've got Todd's year at
college all mapped out.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.076
For the drive home.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.312
Todd.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.750
Whoa, thanks.
You got any fries?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.285
See you in a bit.
Yeah, I'll see you.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.454
Hey, we are going to
have a great year.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.555
I think so.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.958
Yeah. I got them
vibes happening.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.959
Yeah. Yeah.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.028
In a big way.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.399
Hey. Todd, I, uh...

10:01.401 --> 10:03.234
listen, Uncle Harold,

10:03.236 --> 10:05.370
everything's going to be fine.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.972
I'm sure once I get started
in those science classes,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.974
I'll really like it here.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.209
But what about that sports
scholarship they gave you?

10:11.211 --> 10:13.378
I mean, the closest you ever
came to an athletic field

10:13.380 --> 10:16.281
was playing clarinet
in the marching band.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.083
Well, I'm sure once
they take a look at me,

10:18.085 --> 10:20.218
they won't really want me
to try out for any team.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.587
Well, they're not gonna give
you something for nothing.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.556
Well, I guess that's
their problem, huh?

10:26.425 --> 10:28.426
Hey, listen, don't
forget your groceries.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.929
Oh, yeah, thanks.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.797
It's just that
your mom and dad...

10:32.799 --> 10:35.734
I promised them to
look after you, and...

10:35.736 --> 10:38.417
well, the last thing I expected was
to find stiles as your roommate.

10:39.605 --> 10:42.007
Well, he seems ok.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.576
Well, stiles was Scott's
best friend in high school.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.911
He knows all about us.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.747
Well, I figure
since I'm not a...

10:50.950 --> 10:53.485
Since I don't have
the family problem,

10:53.487 --> 10:55.353
there's nothing really
to worry about stiles,

10:55.355 --> 10:57.355
is there?

10:57.357 --> 10:58.456
Yeah, I'm sure you'll be ok.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.824
Hey, listen, uh...

10:59.826 --> 11:01.126
what are you doing?

11:01.128 --> 11:02.193
Take this. You never know.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.261
Thanks.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.000
Well, take care.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.702
Yeah.

11:10.704 --> 11:11.670
What?

11:13.606 --> 11:14.706
If you need anything,

11:14.708 --> 11:16.274
you call me, you hear me?

11:16.276 --> 11:18.276
I will. Ok.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.879
Thanks again, Uncle Harold.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.280
Take it easy.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.016
Call me!

11:33.492 --> 11:35.694
All right, all right, I...
I'll give you a hand later.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.040
En garde!

11:49.642 --> 11:51.342
No mercy!

11:55.181 --> 11:56.481
Hey! Take that!

11:56.483 --> 11:58.016
Take it easy, man!

11:58.018 --> 11:58.917
Die!

12:00.753 --> 12:02.220
He's nuts!

12:02.222 --> 12:02.887
Sorry.

12:06.258 --> 12:07.759
Chocolate milk.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.166
Grab the door for me?

12:15.168 --> 12:16.935
Todd, chubby. Chub, Todd.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.336
Hi. Hi.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.905
Chub played basketball
at beacontown, Todd.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.073
Oh, yeah? You know my cousin?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.341
Scott.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.944
We just love the Howard family.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.912
Stiles, where's all my stuff?

12:27.914 --> 12:28.847
Zoop.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.088
Uh, some of my
t-shirts are in there,

12:37.090 --> 12:39.023
but go ahead and help
yourself, I don't mind.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.729
Hey, stiles, what did you mean
when you told, uh, Uncle Harold

12:44.731 --> 12:46.297
that you'd taken
care of everything?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.599
All your classes.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.134
I registered for you.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.636
You what?

12:51.638 --> 12:53.571
Stiles, I've already
pre-registered.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.140
I know, I saw what you picked.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.708
I made the necessary changes.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.109
Trust me.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.078
Mmm. Mmm.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.546
See, this is all wrong.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.647
Stiles, "girls' volleyball"?

13:02.649 --> 13:03.615
Good class.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.983
"Candle-making,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.618
"French for chefs"?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.253
Ah, <i> c'est tres magnifique.</i>

13:08.255 --> 13:10.722
I took it twice.
I'm taking it again.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.225
I mean, there's not one
science class on here.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.094
Science?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.662
You don't understand.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.969
That boy's got werewolf
written all over him.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.105
If everything goes as planned,

13:27.107 --> 13:29.407
he and I are gonna take
this school by storm.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.076
I love college.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.311
I love it.

13:39.585 --> 13:40.985
I got to change these.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.087
Don't make me laugh, kid.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.857
Rules are rules.
Policy is policy.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.926
You don't understand.
This has got to be changed.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.128
You've got a lot of nerve.
Excuse me.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.831
Nobody ever changes
their classes.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.586
Yeah, what do you want?

14:15.321 --> 14:16.688
Uh, I, uh...

14:16.690 --> 14:17.622
Well?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.325
Well?

14:20.327 --> 14:23.862
Come on, come on. I
haven't got all day.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.699
I'd like to change
some classes.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.481
Have your Professor sign this

14:43.483 --> 14:45.049
and bring it back here,

14:45.051 --> 14:46.551
but not to me.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.819
Thank you.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.587
You're very welcome.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.826
It's not as tough as it looks.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.738
I'm looking for
Professor Brooks.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.574
She's not in there.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.680
Uh... uh, well, I was wondering

15:15.682 --> 15:17.949
if you could tell me
where she might be?

15:17.951 --> 15:20.752
Professor Brooks is both
omnivorous and bipedal.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.624
She's also a
<i>homo sapiens femininus.</i>

15:26.626 --> 15:28.259
And a brilliant one at that.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.042
I'm Tanya Brooks.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.209
Can I help you?

15:45.211 --> 15:47.378
Yeah, I'm Todd... Howard.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.713
Howard, yes.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.282
I know all about you.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.483
You do?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.218
Well, I'm your faculty advisor.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.787
I read your application.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.389
Your talent for science
is very impressive.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.991
That's why I was
surprised to see

15:59.993 --> 16:01.826
that you're here on an
athletic scholarship.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.962
That surprised me, too.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.930
Listen, uh,
Professor Brooks, uh,

16:05.932 --> 16:07.432
I have a little
favor to ask you.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.000
You see, I want to
be a veterinarian,

16:09.002 --> 16:10.601
and I need your class.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.971
I realize registration
is over and everything,

16:12.973 --> 16:14.072
but I was just
wondering if you...

16:14.074 --> 16:15.073
yes.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.607
Yes?

16:16.609 --> 16:18.109
Yes, you're in my class.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.277
It's not full yet.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.279
As your advisor, I'll
make an exception for you.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.714
Really? Thank you.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.585
Thank you very much.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.528
What are you looking at?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.998
I'm looking for
<i>lubrus protozoa.</i>

16:40.000 --> 16:40.865
Oh.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.334
Let's see.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.076
Here it is, right here.

16:59.318 --> 17:00.852
There's nothing on this.

17:03.789 --> 17:06.124
It sort of helps
if you turn it on.

17:10.162 --> 17:11.262
See you.

17:24.810 --> 17:25.977
Are you a coach?

17:25.979 --> 17:27.512
I need to speak to a coach.

17:27.513 --> 17:30.348
There's nothing to talk about.
You're Todd Howard.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.483
We're all depending on you.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.484
Depending on me?

17:33.486 --> 17:34.819
Depending on me for what?

17:34.821 --> 17:35.820
Hey!

17:35.822 --> 17:37.755
You missed a spot!

17:37.757 --> 17:39.357
I know just how you feel.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.059
I had this kid once,

17:41.061 --> 17:43.061
uh, he had an athletic
scholarship just like you.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.229
A gifted athlete,

17:45.231 --> 17:47.065
but he had this crazy dream

17:47.067 --> 17:50.068
about wanting to
become a chiropractor.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.402
But he had to work all night

17:51.404 --> 17:53.938
as a short-order
cook at this diner,

17:53.940 --> 17:56.908
because he was supporting
his, uh, his sister,

17:56.910 --> 17:58.609
and she had 3 kids.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.244
And, uh, wait...

18:00.246 --> 18:01.846
His name was Phillip.

18:01.848 --> 18:02.914
No, wait, er...

18:02.916 --> 18:04.182
Doesn't matter.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.716
Ok, no, but it does,
well, anyway...

18:05.718 --> 18:06.951
No, his name was George

18:06.953 --> 18:08.619
and her 3 kids

18:08.621 --> 18:10.388
were really nice,

18:10.390 --> 18:12.490
but one of them had 2
thumbs on his right hand.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.093
Well...

18:15.095 --> 18:17.528
Did he become a chiropractor?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.864
Uh, not with 2 thumbs on
his right hand, he didn't.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.109
Wait a minute.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.610
You're from beacontown,
aren't you?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.611
Yeah.

18:34.813 --> 18:36.881
Now I get it.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.649
You think that I'm...

18:40.886 --> 18:42.086
Well, you can forget it,

18:42.088 --> 18:43.754
because you see, I'm not Scott.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.590
I can't do what Scott did.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.624
I'm not like him.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.494
What's a 5-letter word
for Italian sausage?

18:49.496 --> 18:52.396
So that's why they gave
me a sports scholarship.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.965
Well, what's the
worst that can happen?

18:53.967 --> 18:55.833
So you jump in the ring,
you go a few rounds,

18:55.835 --> 18:58.436
you get your head
knocked off... maybe...

18:58.438 --> 19:00.878
then y-you get your sports
scholarship, and everybody's happy.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.840
Jump into what ring?

19:02.842 --> 19:05.176
Just show up for practice
this Thursday, ok?

19:05.178 --> 19:06.744
Practice? Practice for what?

19:06.746 --> 19:07.879
Boxing.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.215
"Frank!" That's perfect!

19:19.758 --> 19:21.392
Would you take it easy?

19:23.662 --> 19:25.329
Well, I'm just trying
to make it look good.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.597
I wanna keep this scholarship,

19:26.599 --> 19:28.432
but I don't know
what I'm doing.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.201
Fat kid's a great dancer.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.238
All right. Go, chub.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.509
Ok. You want to play rough?

19:38.511 --> 19:39.877
I'm gonna throw 2 jabs.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.279
You come back with a right.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.529
Which one's the Howard kid?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.764
Hey, Todd.

20:03.735 --> 20:06.304
Well, I guess he's a
little rusty, you know.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.488
If this is some kind of joke,

20:24.490 --> 20:27.225
you'll notice I'm not laughing.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.291
Hey, I had dibs on this.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.426
Possession is
9-10ths of the law.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.794
Oh, so now you're a lawyer?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.229
Thought you were a biologist.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.031
What do you want
with it, anyways?

21:07.033 --> 21:09.100
It's probably over your head.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.736
Over my head?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.537
Over any jock's head.

21:14.306 --> 21:15.273
Jock?

21:18.377 --> 21:19.877
Listen...

21:19.879 --> 21:22.313
All I wanna do is
go to this school,

21:22.315 --> 21:24.482
but I'm here on some
stupid sports scholarship

21:24.484 --> 21:27.985
with a coach who wants
me to have 2 right thumbs.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.254
I got a roommate that sunbathes
with a 40-watt light bulb,

21:30.256 --> 21:32.456
some fat kid eating me
out of house and home,

21:32.458 --> 21:35.493
I got Dean Dunn's dog
trying to bite my leg off,

21:35.495 --> 21:36.594
and you want the only book

21:36.596 --> 21:37.962
that I want in
this entire library?

21:37.964 --> 21:38.863
Shh!

21:40.265 --> 21:41.666
Well, I'll tell you what.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.567
You can have this book

21:43.569 --> 21:46.137
and this book and this
book and this book.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.505
And you can keep
that book as well.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.506
Shh!

21:48.508 --> 21:50.074
You too, buddy.

22:24.843 --> 22:25.910
You ok?

22:27.112 --> 22:28.045
Yeah.

22:29.147 --> 22:30.648
Here.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.484
I think you want this a
little more than I do.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.785
Thanks.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.322
I, um...

22:38.324 --> 22:41.258
I guess I got a little
carried away in there.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.728
I guess you did.

22:58.243 --> 22:59.643
Hey, wait up.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.415
"Phylum and genus classes

23:04.417 --> 23:07.318
"of north American
crustaceans?"

23:07.320 --> 23:09.820
A little light
reading for you, huh?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.058
Listen, I guess I
should have known

23:14.060 --> 23:16.794
that I'd find you in
the science section.

23:20.766 --> 23:23.126
Hey, you know, I probably won't
be needing this book anyway.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.871
I was a science fair
champion in the...

23:26.873 --> 23:28.906
tri-county area.
Tri-county area.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.608
Yeah.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.077
And my research is in
crustacean reproduction.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.745
How exciting.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.416
¶

24:12.951 --> 24:15.152
So, how's your schedule?

24:15.154 --> 24:16.720
Uh, it's better.

24:18.256 --> 24:21.992
Uh, listen, Nicki.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.794
I... I was wondering if, uh...

24:24.629 --> 24:25.696
Well...

24:27.432 --> 24:29.233
Would you like to, uh...

24:29.235 --> 24:31.168
I'd love to.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.269
You would?

24:32.271 --> 24:33.304
Sure.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.572
Great.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.076
Oh, well, I'm busy Friday,

24:39.078 --> 24:40.644
but Saturday I'm free.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.914
Do lab partners usually
work on the weekends

24:43.916 --> 24:45.416
this early in the semester?

24:47.285 --> 24:48.385
Oh.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.323
I thought you were
asking me if...

24:53.859 --> 24:54.925
Really?

24:56.161 --> 24:57.261
Oh.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.463
Well, uh... Then...

24:59.465 --> 25:01.131
You mean you'd...
You'd like to.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.066
I mean, maybe...

25:03.368 --> 25:04.768
Maybe we can.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.441
¶

25:21.219 --> 25:22.353
Hi.

25:22.821 --> 25:23.888
Bye.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.289
Bye-bye. Bye.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.034
Hi.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.702
Hi.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.671
Uh, a-about earlier...

25:40.673 --> 25:42.806
hey, don't worry about it.

25:42.808 --> 25:43.774
It's nothing.

25:45.010 --> 25:45.943
Um...

25:47.312 --> 25:49.013
Oh.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.648
Thanks. You look nice.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.516
Thank you.

25:52.518 --> 25:53.417
You want to dance?

25:53.419 --> 25:54.618
Sure.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.521
How's that left hook?

25:57.523 --> 25:59.156
It's great. It's great.

26:00.425 --> 26:01.892
Todd Howard,

26:01.894 --> 26:03.861
I'd like you to
meet Mrs. St. Claire,

26:03.863 --> 26:06.530
one of our principal
benefactors.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.766
New physics lab,
athletic field,

26:08.768 --> 26:11.735
and, uh, other endowments.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.203
It's a pleasure to meet you.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.939
Thank you. Oh!

26:14.941 --> 26:17.107
I'd like you also to
meet Lisa goldfluss

26:17.109 --> 26:19.777
and Emily lord.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.947
They are co-hostesses of
our reception committee.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.615
We've... we've met.

26:25.550 --> 26:27.418
This fine young man

26:27.420 --> 26:30.955
carries our hopes and
dreams into the ring, eh?

26:32.524 --> 26:34.191
Lisa, dance with Todd.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.392
Uh, Dean Dunn, I...

26:35.394 --> 26:36.660
do it.

26:44.369 --> 26:45.869
What are you smiling
at? You're next.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.373
How's your boyfriend?

26:49.375 --> 26:51.408
I may have to dance with you,

26:51.410 --> 26:53.611
but I don't have
to talk to you.

27:56.608 --> 27:57.741
Hey!

28:24.569 --> 28:26.403
You sure do sweat a lot.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.072
Shut up and dance.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.407
Huh?

29:03.409 --> 29:04.775
Oh, no.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.377
Oh, my God.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.645
Oh, my God.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.090
Aah! Oh, my...

29:20.092 --> 29:21.391
you're a dog.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.460
I've been dancing with a dog.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.230
Yeah, I knew you had it in you!

29:26.232 --> 29:27.965
Hey, look out!

29:27.967 --> 29:29.800
Mrs. Woodbury, be careful.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.569
Aah!

29:32.571 --> 29:33.237
I can't believe...

29:33.239 --> 29:34.605
Aah!

29:34.607 --> 29:35.572
This is by far an outrage.

29:35.574 --> 29:36.640
Deb?

29:37.642 --> 29:38.709
Ugh!

29:41.446 --> 29:44.214
Let me give you a
hand with that.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.682
This has gone much too far.

29:47.152 --> 29:48.619
Miss goldfluss,

29:48.621 --> 29:50.854
do you have an
explanation for this?

29:53.224 --> 29:54.758
What are you so upset about?

29:54.760 --> 29:58.762
Upset, stiles? Me, upset?

29:58.764 --> 30:00.397
I just had a beard
all over my body...

30:00.399 --> 30:01.398
Yeah. Ok?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.666
I had fingernails

30:02.668 --> 30:03.467
the size of French fries. So?

30:03.469 --> 30:05.269
Teeth from here to Texas,

30:05.271 --> 30:07.171
and she called me a dog.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.506
A dog, stiles! Ok, ok.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.408
I might be able
to cut you a deal.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.243
If they'll let you
keep the scholarship,

30:13.245 --> 30:15.512
you'll promise to
be the school mascot.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.114
Yeah?

30:17.116 --> 30:19.349
This is just the tip
of the iceberg, buddy!

30:19.351 --> 30:21.685
The whole school will
be talking about you.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.787
All you gotta do is
be the wolf, Todd.

30:23.789 --> 30:25.422
I'll take care of the rest.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.657
Wonderful.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.426
Wonderful.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.328
She called me a dog.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.764
The bed they laid him in

30:33.766 --> 30:35.566
was only 6 feet long.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.535
His...

30:38.537 --> 30:39.937
His feet...

30:39.939 --> 30:41.405
Hung over the end.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.174
Mary...

30:44.176 --> 30:45.442
His wife...

30:45.444 --> 30:46.944
Clung to his side.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.347
Her tears mingled

30:50.349 --> 30:51.682
with his blood.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.552
Her prayers echoed the grief

30:55.554 --> 30:57.120
of an entire nation.

30:58.489 --> 31:01.358
The small projectile
from the derringer

31:01.360 --> 31:03.894
that John wilkes booth used

31:03.896 --> 31:04.995
was still lodged...

31:04.997 --> 31:06.163
Hey, I got fleas.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.998
You distract him.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.234
And all night long...

31:10.236 --> 31:11.368
Hi.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.303
The vigil waited

31:13.305 --> 31:17.307
in that small boarding house
across from Ford's theatre,

31:17.309 --> 31:19.409
until the wee hours
in the morning...

31:21.847 --> 31:25.148
When fate dealt
that final blow...

31:28.086 --> 31:31.321
A crowd of mourners gathered...

31:31.323 --> 31:33.657
White, black...

31:33.659 --> 31:36.226
Rich and poor.

31:37.496 --> 31:41.531
And so, 10 hours
after that fatal shot,

31:41.533 --> 31:44.234
president Abraham Lincoln...

31:44.236 --> 31:47.271
Mr. Howard,
where are you going?

31:47.273 --> 31:48.906
Mr. Howard.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.178
Todd Howard,

31:55.180 --> 31:57.021
I've been wanting to
speak with you, young man.

31:58.249 --> 32:02.219
Your disruptive behavior
at yesterday's reception

32:02.221 --> 32:05.589
warrants my personal
attention, don't you think?

32:05.591 --> 32:08.725
I don't like practical jokes.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.395
I am not a funny man.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.397
Frankly, I fail
to see the humor

32:13.399 --> 32:15.365
of dressing up in a dog costume

32:15.367 --> 32:17.301
and trying to
frighten our alumni.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.568
But, Dean Dunn...

32:18.570 --> 32:21.571
don't give me any
of that back talk.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.307
If you're trying to push me,

32:24.710 --> 32:27.644
You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

32:34.419 --> 32:36.053
Your first fight is coming up.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.889
So far, I'm unimpressed.

32:38.891 --> 32:40.557
You'd better not fail me,

32:40.559 --> 32:42.225
because if you do,

32:42.227 --> 32:45.062
I'll call every Dean

32:45.064 --> 32:46.997
at every school,

32:46.999 --> 32:48.398
and you'll never go to college,

32:48.400 --> 32:50.600
anywhere, ever.

32:52.171 --> 32:54.304
Do I make myself crystal clear?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.639
Mm-hmm.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.511
Strange boy.

33:06.084 --> 33:07.551
Excuse me.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.287
It's the guy.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.822
You know, the guy who
turned into a dog?

33:11.824 --> 33:13.623
You know, I don't know
what his problem is.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.659
He's really weird.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.028
Everybody's scratching
around here.

33:20.431 --> 33:22.966
Well, anyway, why can't we...

33:22.968 --> 33:25.102
Todd, we're all looking
forward to your presentation.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.370
Are you ready?

33:26.372 --> 33:27.771
Oh.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.172
Yeah. I think so.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.882
Todd, I want to see you.

33:38.884 --> 33:41.251
All right, everyone. That's
all for today. Thank you.

33:44.622 --> 33:46.356
Do you want to go to lunch?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.525
You don't want to be seen with me.
I'm a dog.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.194
Do you want to go
to lunch, or not?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.156
Nicki, I've got to go see
the Professor right now.

33:57.802 --> 34:00.237
They're giving you a
hard time, aren't they?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.706
I'm your faculty advisor.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.508
Maybe there's something
I can do to help.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.475
I don't think so.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.244
Well, I would like to try.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.347
You have a talent for science.
Let's start with that.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.916
No matter what anybody
says or does to you,

34:12.918 --> 34:15.152
you shouldn't lose
sight of your goals.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.585
All I wanted to do
was to study hard

34:16.588 --> 34:17.853
and become a veterinarian.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.822
I can help you with that.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.192
You're a very bright
young man, Todd.

34:22.194 --> 34:25.594
You'll find a way to deal
with your other problems.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.731
If you only knew,
Professor Brooks.

34:30.168 --> 34:33.570
Well, I'll do my very best
to try and understand.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.839
In any case, I'm always
here if you need me.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.507
Ok.

34:57.895 --> 34:59.596
I hope you're hungry.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.431
I got a ton of stuff here.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.802
You like chicken, don't you?

35:05.804 --> 35:07.437
Why are you doing this?

35:07.439 --> 35:08.705
Because I'm hungry.

35:13.644 --> 35:15.212
Drumstick?

35:15.214 --> 35:17.214
Nick, you know what I mean.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.915
Listen...

35:18.917 --> 35:21.485
Biologically speaking,
it's absolutely fascinating

35:21.487 --> 35:23.186
what's happened to you.

35:24.622 --> 35:25.789
If you think I'm gonna

35:25.791 --> 35:27.057
feel sorry for you,

35:27.059 --> 35:28.291
you can forget it.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.726
But I'm a dog.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.696
You'll be ok.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.698
You will.

36:15.873 --> 36:18.475
1, 2, 3. Come on.
You're outta here.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.510
Bring the doctor in here.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.190
How many does that make?

36:33.192 --> 36:34.891
3 for them. None for us.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.228
Ok, you're up next, big guy.

36:39.664 --> 36:42.032
Coach, it isn't
my weight class.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.600
That'll be my
problem, ok? Go on.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.709
W-what do I... w-what if I...

36:52.711 --> 36:54.411
you gotta be kiddin'
me. That guy's a tub.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.213
He outweighs my
guy by 50 pounds.

36:56.215 --> 36:57.881
It's all water
weight. Look at him.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.970
All right, chubby, look
tough, look tough.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.366
Let's box.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.034
Hey!

37:18.036 --> 37:19.102
What are you doing?

37:19.104 --> 37:20.237
Put him down.

37:21.539 --> 37:22.939
Put me down!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.507
I'm warning you.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.010
All right. Let's... let's box.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.847
You pig!

37:30.849 --> 37:31.348
I'm warning you. Come on.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.682
Come on.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.519
Come on. Come on.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.088
Use your weight,
chub. Use your weight.

37:42.960 --> 37:43.927
Break.

37:43.929 --> 37:44.961
Break!

37:56.941 --> 37:58.108
Aah!

38:01.145 --> 38:01.978
Huh.

38:03.581 --> 38:04.648
Yeah!

38:07.052 --> 38:07.951
Huh.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.468
That's the last fight you win.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.143
All right, chubby.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.254
All right, Gus.

38:44.256 --> 38:45.822
Take him, babe. Take him.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.157
Get out there, babe.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.091
All right.

39:00.371 --> 39:01.738
Ok, get in there.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.549
Ok, let's box.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.159
Next.

39:58.662 --> 39:59.596
Next.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.167
Don't worry,

40:04.169 --> 40:05.735
there's a good
hospital on campus.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.003
Let's get this over with.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.138
I got a date in a half hour.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.249
"Let's go, big blue, let's go.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.518
"Let's go, big blue, let's go.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.019
"Let's go, big blue, let's go."

40:26.123 --> 40:28.124
This makes or
breaks your career.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.027
We want a knock out!

40:31.029 --> 40:32.162
Let's go, pug!

40:35.065 --> 40:37.267
You're going to die.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.334
I know.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.881
Move! Move! Move!

40:53.951 --> 40:55.118
Knock him out!

40:58.489 --> 40:59.722
Great move!

40:59.724 --> 41:01.324
I'm going to break
your kneecaps

41:01.326 --> 41:03.006
if you don't keep still
and let me hit you.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.471
Come on, pug, come on!

41:31.355 --> 41:32.789
All right. All right.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.023
Yeah!

41:34.025 --> 41:35.425
All right, get back over there.

41:35.427 --> 41:36.860
Come on.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.862
You're history.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.730
I knew it. I knew pug
would win that fight.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.201
You ok, kid?

41:45.203 --> 41:46.636
1, 2...

41:46.638 --> 41:48.671
Todd, get up. Come on!

41:48.673 --> 41:50.313
Get up, Todd! Don't
lay there like a fish.

41:55.613 --> 41:56.546
3...

42:02.821 --> 42:03.620
4...

42:10.294 --> 42:11.427
5...

42:20.471 --> 42:22.205
Holy shit!

42:23.240 --> 42:25.642
Yeah! Yeah!

42:26.377 --> 42:28.311
Yeah! Yeah!

42:28.313 --> 42:29.579
What is this?

42:29.581 --> 42:31.714
It's that dog you
were dancing with.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.083
You want to stop the fight?

42:34.085 --> 42:35.752
Hell, no.

42:35.754 --> 42:36.786
Go on.

42:45.729 --> 42:46.930
All right...

42:46.932 --> 42:47.830
Box!

42:49.266 --> 42:50.767
Stay away from him, pug.

42:53.337 --> 42:54.571
Nail him, Todd.

42:54.573 --> 42:55.738
Nail him!

43:04.949 --> 43:07.250
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

43:10.622 --> 43:11.688
Come on.

43:13.390 --> 43:14.857
What are you doing?

43:14.859 --> 43:16.192
Get in there and kill him.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.136
Look, he's got a right hook.
He can fight.

43:39.316 --> 43:40.617
Murder him!

43:45.657 --> 43:46.823
Pug!

43:47.558 --> 43:48.825
You're out.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.797
Yeah! Yeah!

43:54.799 --> 43:55.865
Yee-ha!

44:09.780 --> 44:10.780
Have no fear,

44:10.782 --> 44:12.849
stiles is here.

44:12.851 --> 44:14.617
Ok, we're going
to rock 'n' roll.

44:14.619 --> 44:16.653
The brewskis are
coming, everybody.

44:16.655 --> 44:18.154
We're going to have a party.

44:18.156 --> 44:20.089
We're going to
have so much fun.

44:23.193 --> 44:24.827
We need music!

44:26.364 --> 44:27.430
<i>Is this thing on?</i>

44:27.432 --> 44:29.098
<i>Can you hear me? Good.</i>

44:29.100 --> 44:31.200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

44:31.202 --> 44:34.337
<i>we have a very special guest
with us this evening.</i>

44:34.339 --> 44:36.305
<i>Not only does our teen wolf</i>

44:36.307 --> 44:38.875
<i>throw a punch like lightning,</i>

44:38.877 --> 44:40.543
<i>but he sings, too.</i>

44:43.947 --> 44:46.382
<i>¶ You broke my heart ¶</i>

44:46.384 --> 44:48.985
<i>¶ 'cause I couldn't dance ¶</i>

44:48.987 --> 44:51.287
<i>¶ you didn't even</i>
<i>want me around ¶</i>

44:52.556 --> 44:54.023
<i>¶ but now I'm back ¶</i>

44:54.025 --> 44:55.658
<i>¶ to let you know ¶</i>

44:55.660 --> 44:58.561
<i>¶ I can really shake 'em down ¶</i>

44:58.563 --> 45:00.363
<i>¶ do you love me? ¶</i>

45:00.365 --> 45:01.698
<i>¶ I can really move ¶</i>

45:01.700 --> 45:03.533
<i>¶ do you love me? ¶</i>

45:03.535 --> 45:05.034
<i>¶ I'm in the groove ¶</i>

45:05.036 --> 45:07.236
<i>¶ now do you love me? ¶</i>

48:19.731 --> 48:21.764

Anything you need.

The championship...

51:28.052 --> 51:29.685
it's just 2 weeks away.

51:29.687 --> 51:31.420
It's down to just
you and that wolf.

51:31.422 --> 51:32.988
Any predictions?

51:34.291 --> 51:36.192
Every dog has his day,

51:36.194 --> 51:37.793
and his is mine.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.728
<i>¶ I'd rather be a cowboy ¶</i>

Hello?

54:11.081 --> 54:12.081
Emily.

54:12.083 --> 54:13.048
Stiles.

54:13.050 --> 54:14.083
Yeah?

54:14.085 --> 54:15.351
Go away.

54:15.353 --> 54:17.086
What?

54:17.088 --> 54:19.255
You don't mind, do you, buddy?

54:20.591 --> 54:21.557
Lisa!

54:21.559 --> 54:23.092
Whoo-ee!

54:23.094 --> 54:24.226
Hey, Todd!

54:24.228 --> 54:26.395
Stiles, beat it.

54:26.397 --> 54:27.696
Chubby?

54:30.233 --> 54:31.300
Chubby.

54:32.035 --> 54:33.202
Chub.

54:40.977 --> 54:42.211
Chubby.

54:42.213 --> 54:43.345
Huh?

54:51.222 --> 54:52.288
Chubby.

54:53.223 --> 54:54.390
What?

54:56.393 --> 54:58.060
I've created a monster.

55:00.497 --> 55:01.664
Mmm.

55:07.604 --> 55:08.671
Mmm?

55:27.123 --> 55:29.725
Ok, so I was absent the
day you guys did this.

55:33.963 --> 55:36.031
Are you mad at me?

55:36.033 --> 55:37.199
Huh.

55:37.201 --> 55:39.301
You're jealous. What?

55:39.303 --> 55:40.469
Of those 2 leeches

55:40.471 --> 55:41.870
you've been
hanging around with?

55:41.872 --> 55:43.005
You can't even see it,

55:43.007 --> 55:43.872
can you?

55:44.641 --> 55:45.774
They don't like you,

55:45.776 --> 55:47.009
only the wolf.

55:47.644 --> 55:48.977
Look.

55:48.979 --> 55:51.780
Just because everything's
going great for me

55:51.782 --> 55:53.949
doesn't give you the right
to go off and start...

56:00.223 --> 56:02.358
you just hit me
with a dead frog.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.325
Jerk.

56:03.327 --> 56:04.259
Jerk?

56:14.804 --> 56:16.071
Frog fight!

56:26.649 --> 56:27.916
Incoming!

56:40.230 --> 56:42.564
What is going on here?

56:42.566 --> 56:44.767
Frog fighting in my lab?

56:44.769 --> 56:46.668
Put those things away.

56:48.204 --> 56:50.506
That's the end of
class for today.

56:51.875 --> 56:53.342
Except for you.

56:54.177 --> 56:55.978
I want to talk to you.

57:15.732 --> 57:18.467
I've been talking with
your other professors.

57:19.536 --> 57:21.236
I know about the car,

57:21.238 --> 57:22.738
about the grades
you're getting,

57:22.740 --> 57:24.773
and how you're
coasting through.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.542
It's like anything
else in life.

57:26.544 --> 57:27.910
When you have a gift,

57:27.912 --> 57:30.879
you have a responsibility
to use it wisely.

57:30.881 --> 57:32.781
You're not.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.850
And you're only letting
yourself down.

57:36.085 --> 57:38.587
Are you in a hurry?

57:38.589 --> 57:42.057
Yeah, actually, I have
to get to practice.

57:42.059 --> 57:43.826
Team's nothing
without the wolf.

57:43.828 --> 57:45.594
You can't face life as a wolf

57:45.596 --> 57:47.429
and expect it to solve
all your problems.

57:47.431 --> 57:49.131
You do realize

57:49.133 --> 57:50.999
you have finals
coming up, don't you?

57:51.001 --> 57:53.268
Oh, yeah. Regional finals.

57:53.270 --> 57:55.571
No. Course finals.

57:58.842 --> 58:00.609
Listen,

58:00.611 --> 58:02.544
I don't think
I need this class.

58:04.180 --> 58:05.113
You told me to choose

58:05.115 --> 58:06.782
the right path,

58:06.784 --> 58:07.683
and with the road

58:07.685 --> 58:09.251
that I've chosen...

58:10.487 --> 58:12.754
I don't think I
need biology at all.

58:17.293 --> 58:19.228
I'm very sorry to hear that.

58:30.707 --> 58:32.374
You waited for me?

58:35.812 --> 58:37.412
I don't know why.

58:40.984 --> 58:43.619
You know, I never
thought I'd say it,

58:43.621 --> 58:45.287
but I miss the old Todd.

58:47.390 --> 58:48.857
What happened?

58:50.460 --> 58:52.027
He turned into a werewolf.

58:52.029 --> 58:54.396
But that's not the real you.

58:54.398 --> 58:55.564
The wolf lets me do

58:55.566 --> 58:56.832
what I want to do.

58:56.834 --> 58:58.500
Ok? It's a gift.

58:58.502 --> 59:00.502
I've a responsibility
to myself...

59:00.504 --> 59:01.637
responsibility?

59:01.639 --> 59:03.038
What about school?

59:03.040 --> 59:04.840
What about wanting
to be a veterinarian?

59:04.842 --> 59:06.241
What about you and me?

59:09.913 --> 59:12.414
My feelings for you are real.

59:12.416 --> 59:14.583
They have nothing
to do with the wolf.

59:14.585 --> 59:17.653
Those others could care
less about the real you.

59:17.655 --> 59:19.488
Look, I'm late,
and you're wrong.

59:32.769 --> 59:34.570
That's the way
it's done, girls.

59:39.576 --> 59:40.943
Hmph.

59:40.945 --> 59:42.244
Watch this.

59:55.224 --> 59:56.959
We'll play through.

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.865
How can you take him seriously?

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:05.500
He's a freshman...

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:08.704
With an awful lot of hair.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:16.578
Why don't you shut your mouth?

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.480
Why don't we settle
this man-to-man?

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:19.881
I don't fight chipmunks.

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:20.949
Not here, Gus.

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.997
What are you doing?

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.504
Where are you going?

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:46.808
You die in the ring, pal.

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.156
Fore!

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.193
It's in the hole.

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:21.843
You guys studying?

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:23.845
Yes.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.982
Some of us actually
have to take finals.

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:27.883
Hmm.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.589
Mr. Stilinsky...

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:40.529
What say you, me,
and the wolf...

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.831
Take the wheels for a little...

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.369
Spin?

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.136
Nope.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.471
Hmm? No?

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.913
How about you, big guy, huh?

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:00.148
I might even let you drive.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.717
What do you say?

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:04.820
I'm busy. Ok?

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.558
See you, stiles.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.992
See you, chub.

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.600
Shot a 46.

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:20.769
You know, it's funny. Mmm?

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:22.070
I wanted you to become the wolf

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.239
more than anybody else.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.607
So I guess I'm partly to blame

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:27.509
for what you've become.

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:31.747
What have I become?

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.916
A jerk, Todd.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:35.784
Aw!

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.066
Thank you for coming.

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:26.168
I, uh...

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.639
I really need to talk to you.

01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:32.841
You're in a tough spot, huh?

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:33.809
Yeah.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.748
I just let it get out of hand.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.854
I mean, I know you...

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:47.756
You warned me.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:54.396
And I guess I should
have listened because...

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.533
I got a little
crazy, Uncle Harold,

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.969
and I ended up hurting...

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.405
A lot of people that
I really care about.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.175
What are you going
to do about it?

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.745
I don't know.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:16.151
I really don't know.

01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:18.386
Well, don't be too
tough on yourself.

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:20.722
After all...

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.624
You're only human, too.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.260
So?

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:28.163
So you made a mistake.

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:29.164
You admitted it.

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:30.966
It's over.

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:33.802
Maybe it's time you
were Todd Howard again.

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.705
I'm scared.

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.243
Really scared.

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:47.349
I mean, if I'm myself
in this ring tomorrow,

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:49.150
I'll get killed.

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:50.919
Oh, I don't think you're
going to get killed.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.822
This guy's really big.

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:56.825
He's huge.

01:04:56.827 --> 01:04:59.027
Never mind him,

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:01.196
because what I'm
interested in is you

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:03.164
and what you've
got right there.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.236
What's that got to do
with the game of boxing

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.005
when the guy's twice your size?

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:12.007
Well...

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:13.808
Uncle Harold, I wouldn't
stand a chance.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:15.944
Maybe not.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:23.551
But sometimes, you
have to make a stand,

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.387
even if it's the last
thing you want to do.

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:27.422
What's that?

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:28.924
These are boxing gloves.
They used to belong to me.

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:30.525
It may come as a
to surprise you,

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:31.760
but when I was in college,

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.795
I did a fair bit
of boxing myself.

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:34.896
Really? Yeah, really.

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:36.765
Maybe I can show you
a couple of moves

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:39.100
nobody's seen in
the last 30 years.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.468
Now, when's this big match?

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:41.469
Tomorrow.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:42.971
Plenty of time.

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.070
What are you doing?

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:16.204
Studying.

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:19.874
I still have 2 more finals.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:22.978
I guess you wouldn't
know about that.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.186
Nicki.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:33.922
I'm real sorry...

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.926
For everything.

01:06:37.928 --> 01:06:39.995
I guess the wolf
makes you a jerk.

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.130
No.

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:43.398
I'm a jerk.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:48.103
I just hope that...

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:50.839
There's still time to
make up for it all.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.883
There's still time to try.

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:03.618
Well, I, uh, I want to try.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.454
You can start by saying

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:08.356
you're really sorry

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:09.391
for mistreating someone

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.826
you like.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.029
I'm sorry for
mistreating someone...

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.798
I really love.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.779
You missed your final.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:32.514
What?

01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:33.882
Your final.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:36.351
I'm sure Professor
Brooks flunked you.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:37.652
Oh.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:38.820
Yeah.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.589
Maybe we could talk to her.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.491
Yeah.

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.665
Professor Brooks.

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:51.599
Hi!

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:53.334
Hi.

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:56.438
We were just coming
to see you. Um...

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.373
Listen, I know I probably
don't deserve it,

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:02.010
but if you're willing to
give me a 2nd chance,

01:08:02.012 --> 01:08:03.845
I'd really like
to earn my grade.

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:06.714
Well, you can take
a make-up exam

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:07.882
tomorrow at Oo noon.

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:09.851
That's the latest
I can give it.

01:08:09.853 --> 01:08:12.654
I have to turn the grades
in by the end of the day.

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.857
I have a fight at 3:00, see?

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:17.792
Well, the test takes 3 hours.

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:19.961
You ought to just make it.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.429
That's my final offer.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.564
Take it or leave it.

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:23.898
We'll take it!

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.533
Yeah, thank you very much!

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.908

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.484
Thanks.

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:24.752
And at the match.

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:48.610
Bye.

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:37.959
Well...

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.629
That's the best I could do.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.531
I missed a few classes.

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:51.406
Well, it looks like

01:11:51.408 --> 01:11:53.474
you did well enough
to pass the course.

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:55.543
Great.

01:11:58.113 --> 01:11:59.714
Professor Brooks,

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:02.617
I really want to thank you

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:05.520
for trying to help

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:07.588
when things got a little...

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.490
Crazy.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.892
Welcome back.

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.083
Where've you been?

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:37.285
Taking a final.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.189
Where's the wolf?

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.724
What are you doing?
You got to go fight

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:44.926
in the 145-pound class now.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.029
That's Peter's weight class.

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:50.665
Yeah, so what?

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:53.067
Look, coach, we are a team.

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:58.072
We're going to fight as a team.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:00.875
And by the way, I am
going up against Gus.

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:03.978
That's great. That's great.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.246
All of you, go on out there

01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:07.014
and get your
brains knocked out.

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:08.916
That'll be attractive.

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:26.534
¶ Hamilton ¶

01:13:26.536 --> 01:13:31.038
¶ thou art highest
of them all ¶

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.076
¶ we, your loyal subjects ¶

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:38.880
¶ are listening for your call ¶

01:13:38.882 --> 01:13:43.117
¶ proud are we of your emblem ¶

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:46.587
¶ of your columns
straight and... ¶

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:47.522
white! White!

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:49.524
¶ White ¶

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:53.027
¶ so let's get
in the ring, boys ¶

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.596
¶ and fight, fight, fight ¶

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.965
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.814
This is only the beginning.

01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:15.483
From here, we go to
the state finals,

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:18.920
then the nationals,
the Olympics!

01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:21.289
Remember, this is
only your first year.

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:25.893
What you've got to
do is fight and win,

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:27.295
and I'll take care of the rest.

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:28.262
Grades...

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:29.330
Cars...

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:30.398
Money...

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.833
Women!

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.970
It'll be our little secret.

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.511
I hope you don't
have any funny ideas

01:14:43.513 --> 01:14:45.646
about not fighting as the wolf.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:49.150
Oh, no.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.986
Remember, I still
run this school!

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.656
I hold your scholarship.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.464
Give 'em hell, kid.

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:57.151
"Way to go, Hamilton!

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:58.486
"Way to go! Fight, fight!

01:15:58.488 --> 01:15:59.921
"Way to go, Hamilton!

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:01.589
"Way to go! Fight, fight!

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:02.723
"Way to go, Hamilton!

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.358
"Way to go! Fight, fight!

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.760
"Way to go, Hamilton!

"Way to go! Fight, fight!

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:08.529
"Way to go, Hamilton!

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:09.864
"Way to go! Fight, fight!"

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:13.267
¶ Hamilton says,
for all to see ¶

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:15.269
¶ "we're gonna float
like a butterfly ¶

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:17.071
¶ "and sting like a bee!" ¶

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.706
¶ we know how to punch! ¶

¶ we know how to fight! ¶

¶ we're gonna hit 'em
with the left ¶

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.878
¶ then we'll hit 'em
with the right! ¶

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:27.214
Ok, Peter! Peter!

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:28.349
Peter, you're next!

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:29.483
Go on up!

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.338
I'm sorry. I'm busy right now.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.442
I know what you're doing.

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:56.611
I know about the car,

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:57.745
the grades,

01:16:57.747 --> 01:16:59.647
and the promises.

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:01.015
I want you to lay off.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.384
Todd Howard has a future

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:04.585
at this school,

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:06.754
but it's not in the ring.

01:17:06.756 --> 01:17:09.123
Who do you think
you're talking to?

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.459
He'll do exactly as I say.

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:12.860
You don't own him.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:16.597
Is this your idea of a threat?

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:17.698
No.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.467
This is.

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:32.647
You don't know

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:33.981
who you're dealing with.

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:01.842
Yeah!

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.619
Yeah!

01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:13.421
All right, chubby! Come on!

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:14.955

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:04.772
He's out.

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:06.040
Let him go, let him go.

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:08.342
Come on, come on,
come on. Put him down.

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:11.112
Put him down so I can count.

01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:13.781
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:15.082

What is the meaning of this?

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.914
Um... Tactics.

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:28.616
I'll have him kicked
out of this college!

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:32.219
Bring out the wolf!

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.454
Dean Dunn,

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:37.658
I won't be needing
these anymore.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.027
It's my last fight.

01:21:40.029 --> 01:21:41.829
Good. I hope he kills you.

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:46.100
He probably will.

01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:47.101
Sure you know what you're doing?

01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:48.736
Are you kidding?

01:21:48.738 --> 01:21:50.738
It pays to be
positive, big guy..

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:52.339
Come on!

01:21:54.844 --> 01:21:55.976
Box!

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:59.446
He made such a great wolf.

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:07.821
Kill him, Todd!

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.735
Come on, come on.
Hit me. Hit me.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:25.406
Come on. Hit me.
Right here. Hit me.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:28.709
Come on. Come on.
Hit me. Hit me.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:32.613
Come on. Come on.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.548
My grandmother hits
harder than that.

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:35.783
Take that!

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.661
Come on!

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:48.963
Good round!

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.932
Try that with me!

01:22:51.934 --> 01:22:54.301
What are you? Come on. Come on.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.636
Come on. Calm down now.

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:58.772
Get back. Back.

01:22:58.774 --> 01:23:00.641
Hey, look, I'm warning you.

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:18.926
Are you listening to me?

01:23:18.928 --> 01:23:19.860
Yeah.

01:23:19.862 --> 01:23:21.829
Cut the ring off on him.

01:23:26.968 --> 01:23:28.102
How you doing? All right.

01:23:28.104 --> 01:23:29.303
You feeling ok?

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:31.538
Keep them in, keep them tight.
How's the ribs?

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.440
Aah! Uh, chubby?

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:34.375
Give me some.

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:35.142
How's the jaw?

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:36.477
Ow!

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:37.811
Hey, listen, I'm really sorry

01:23:37.813 --> 01:23:39.346
I called the wolf a jerk.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.681
Don't worry, I was a jerk.

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:42.016
But if you don't turn
back into the jerk,

01:23:42.018 --> 01:23:43.617
you're gonna get
us both killed.

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:45.219
It's gotta be this way.

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.455
Coach, you got
anything to say to me?

01:23:49.959 --> 01:23:51.859
Well, um...

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:54.428
No.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.400
Go out and kick
some butt, Todd!

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:01.068
Take him now, take him!

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:05.973
Break! Break!

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.676
Step back. Step back.

01:24:09.678 --> 01:24:10.978
He's a baby!

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:14.948
Let's box.

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:31.932
Come on. Get up.

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:37.905
Break!

01:24:37.907 --> 01:24:39.173
Let go, you sissy.
Break! Come on, let's go.

01:24:39.175 --> 01:24:40.407
Let him go. Break!

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:41.508
Break, I say.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:42.643
Box!

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.379
Aw!

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:21.949
Come on. Sit down.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:28.956
That's an early bell!

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.591
I said, "sit down!"

01:25:30.593 --> 01:25:32.459
Oh, God.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:34.895
Come on, ref, keep your
eyes open over there.

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:43.570
Now listen,

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:45.506
unless you're planning on
wolfing out on this guy,

01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:47.174
I suggest we throw in
the proverbial towel.

01:25:47.176 --> 01:25:48.142
I'm not quitting.

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:49.910
Todd!

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:59.853
Don't worry. It's not
as bad as it looks.

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:10.831
You're way ahead on points, ok?

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:11.965
You got both rounds.

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:13.800
Keep fighting the same fight.

01:26:13.802 --> 01:26:15.836
Look at his face. Look
at his face over there.

01:26:15.838 --> 01:26:17.171
That guy's in trouble.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.506
You got it? You got it? Go!

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:25.012
Touch gloves.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:26.280
Last round.

01:26:26.282 --> 01:26:27.181
Box!

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:33.520
Go, Todd, go! Go, Todd, go!

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.522
Do it!

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:44.865
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:52.005
I'm gonna make you
howl with pain.

01:26:52.007 --> 01:26:53.907
It's gonna be a long night.

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:15.229
Come on, come on.

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:16.730
Back in the ring, back in the ring.
Let's go, let's go!

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:19.566
He's going to kill him.
Somebody do something!

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:21.368
Don't worry.

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:23.103
He'll be all right.

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:28.408
Are you all right?

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:32.246
Back, back, back.
Get back in there.

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:34.348
Where are you going? Home.

01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:35.782
Ok. Let's box.

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:52.366
1...

01:27:52.368 --> 01:27:54.434
Get back, blue. Nuetral corner.

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:56.470
2...

01:27:56.472 --> 01:27:57.638
3...
