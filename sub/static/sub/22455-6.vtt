00:24.905 --> 00:26.862
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:26.906 --> 00:28.898
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.381
Yeah.

00:31.428 --> 00:36.140
'This is bad, very bad. The canal -
perfect venue for the emotional bump-off

00:36.190 --> 00:39.069
'cos if I start screaming, there's no-one to hear.

00:39.111 --> 00:42.742
'On the plus side, she's obviously confident
I'm not a potential murderer.'

00:42.793 --> 00:45.183
Listen, Jez, honey, I...

00:45.234 --> 00:49.309
I need to talk to you about something. About us.

00:49.356 --> 00:51.917
'Here it comes. No blubbing, no garment rending.'

00:51.957 --> 00:56.111
- Yeah?
- Jez, I've got a biggie to ask you.

00:56.159 --> 00:58.674
- Would you consider marrying me?
- Yes!

00:58.720 --> 01:02.510
Obviously it wouldn't be a real wedding.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.757
No? Oh, right.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.031
Well, in that case...

01:06.083 --> 01:06.994
yes!

01:07.044 --> 01:11.039
See, it's just my visa's run out
and the Home Office called.

01:11.086 --> 01:13.442
I know a couple of gay guys
who'd be up for it but...

01:13.487 --> 01:17.197
Oh, Nancy, don't marry those gays. Marry me.

01:17.248 --> 01:20.765
Honey, you understand this would just be
an administrative procedure, right?

01:20.810 --> 01:21.959
Exactly.

01:23.411 --> 01:26.643
The happiest administrative procedure of our lives.

01:26.692 --> 01:28.649
Hey, I'm home.

01:28.693 --> 01:30.810
I've got Gladiator on DVD.

01:30.854 --> 01:35.372
Apparently there's an outtake where
this extra gets piked and you can see all the...

01:35.416 --> 01:37.567
Jez, you're cleaning the bathroom.

01:37.617 --> 01:39.336
That's right, my friend.

01:39.378 --> 01:42.736
'Why?! Sex slavery? Murder clear-up? '

01:42.780 --> 01:46.820
See, if it's all right with you,
which I'm sure it will be, Nancy's moving in.

01:46.861 --> 01:47.897
She is?

01:47.942 --> 01:51.413
Mmm. As an actual precursor
to us getting married. On Friday.

01:51.463 --> 01:53.774
- You're getting married?!
- That's right.

01:53.825 --> 01:57.136
- Why?
- Well, because we love each other.

01:57.186 --> 01:59.417
Also, partially, for visa reasons.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.777
What do you want me to do
with all your toilet books?

02:01.828 --> 02:06.745
Don't you think...
Nancy, isn't she using you... a bit?

02:06.790 --> 02:10.751
Oh, OK, great.
Well, thanks for your show of support, mate

02:10.792 --> 02:16.347
I was gonna ask you to be best man
but, actually, maybe I should ask Super Hans.

02:16.395 --> 02:19.786
Yeah, well, sure,
if that's the way you feel, maybe you should.

02:19.836 --> 02:23.672
You're just jealous
because you want to get married to Sophie.

02:23.718 --> 02:26.950
Jeremy, I'm totally and completely over Sophie.

02:26.999 --> 02:30.835
Oh, sure. And I suppose
that's the reason why you wrote her name

02:30.881 --> 02:33.191
on every single egg under the Word Bird.

02:37.524 --> 02:40.483
So, Super Hans, what've you been up to?

02:40.525 --> 02:44.645
- Long weekend looking into the mirror.
- Oh, bit of soul-searching, was it?

02:44.687 --> 02:46.724
Cocaine, Mark, cocaine.

02:46.768 --> 02:51.685
Fancy a punt on the quizzie?
Shit a bit of data out of that bunged-up brainbox?

02:51.730 --> 02:54.325
I'll do the buttons, you do the answers.

02:54.371 --> 02:56.807
Listen, I wanted to have a chat about Nancy.

02:56.853 --> 03:00.927
You mean Yoko? Yeah, hello marriage,
goodbye major recording contract.

03:00.974 --> 03:02.806
So you agree it's a terrible...

03:02.855 --> 03:04.005
Capital of Indonesia?

03:04.056 --> 03:06.446
Er, Jakarta.

03:06.497 --> 03:10.856
Correct. She's got trouble
written through her like a stick of Brighton rock.

03:10.899 --> 03:15.099
So I thought we could split them up.
Maybe you could tell him you got off with her.

03:15.141 --> 03:19.261
Fucking hell, that's a bit strong.
Where might you find a dipthong?

03:19.303 --> 03:21.339
- It's an element of speech.
- Where might you find one?

03:21.383 --> 03:24.695
- In a word.
- Good boy. Why don't you do it?

03:24.745 --> 03:27.624
He'd never believe it, whereas you...

03:27.666 --> 03:32.663
Yeah, you're right, much more believable. Jamie
Lee Curtis, born a hermaphrodite - true or false?

03:32.709 --> 03:35.065
Urban myth.

03:35.110 --> 03:38.581
I don't know. I don't wanna come out fighting
with just my cock in my hand.

03:38.631 --> 03:41.271
If I go for it, are you gonna back me up?

03:41.312 --> 03:43.873
- This is for the jackpot.
- Of course I'll back you up.

03:43.914 --> 03:46.383
- What kind of animal was Rikki Tikki Tavi?
- A mongoose.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.506
- Piss off, he's a little rat.
- He was a mongoose.

03:48.556 --> 03:51.117
- Rat!
- Mongoose!

03:51.157 --> 03:53.592
See! Told you.

03:53.638 --> 03:59.476
Yeah, but I was in charge of the buttons, Mark.
I drew a line. You crossed that line.

04:00.641 --> 04:04.795
I'll have to have a think about you. I don't
know if you can be trusted in a combat situation.

04:06.363 --> 04:08.355
Thanks so much for sorting me out with this, Toni.

04:08.404 --> 04:12.479
You would not believe how hard it is
to get into trainers and architecting.

04:12.526 --> 04:14.085
It's practically a closed shop.

04:16.088 --> 04:18.398
Oh, I love this!

04:18.449 --> 04:21.886
Yeah, well,
I'll take all the phone monkeys I can wrangle.

04:21.930 --> 04:26.608
Yeah. It's great though -
my own phone, my own space,

04:26.653 --> 04:28.609
might move that to there.

04:28.653 --> 04:31.613
Me, bringing home the bacon for my fiancee.

04:31.655 --> 04:35.092
How is the Yank?
She started spanking your plank again?

04:35.136 --> 04:37.776
That's not terribly important really, Toni.

04:37.817 --> 04:40.093
You see, we're very much in love.

04:40.139 --> 04:43.655
Jez, I've seen Love Story.
I know how it ends, yeah?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.090
Here's a clue - somebody dies.

04:47.542 --> 04:51.856
I can't believe you wanted to meet for lunch!
You really meant it about being friends.

04:51.904 --> 04:53.782
Of course I meant it, Mark. How've you been?

04:53.825 --> 04:57.978
Fine, fine. The human being's basic needs
are really very simple...

04:58.026 --> 05:01.782
food, liquid, entertainment and the regular
release of fluids at regular intervals.

05:01.828 --> 05:03.865
Nice. And how's your love life?

05:03.909 --> 05:07.267
"Love life" may be a grandiose term
for staring at women on the bus.

05:07.311 --> 05:09.746
Oh, shut up.
You just need to find someone you like.

05:09.792 --> 05:12.148
Oh, what about her?
I know her, she's a friend of Nancy's.

05:12.193 --> 05:15.152
- Hi, Karen!
- Sophie, be quiet!

05:15.194 --> 05:19.109
- You like her.
- I don't necessarily like her.

05:19.156 --> 05:21.113
Yes you do. Go and tell her you like her hair.

05:21.157 --> 05:24.514
You do realise it's me you're talking to,
not an Italian builder?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.675
OK, I'll go and talk to her for you.

05:26.719 --> 05:29.075
Sophie, no! No, Sophie, no, don't!

05:30.481 --> 05:32.837
'Oh, God, this is terrible.

05:32.882 --> 05:37.639
'Maybe it'll go really well and I'll have
a double wedding with Jeremy on Friday.

05:37.684 --> 05:39.641
'Oh, no, she's coming.

05:39.685 --> 05:43.282
'Must... think... words, funny words.'

05:43.327 --> 05:46.126
- Hi there.
- Hi, hi.

05:46.168 --> 05:49.559
Say, isn't it funny, all the... coffee?

05:50.850 --> 05:55.801
What's with all the coffee?
Listen, I'm just gonna go over to my stupid friend

05:55.852 --> 05:58.492
and, grrr, give her a good shake.

05:58.533 --> 06:03.610
But if you ever want to call me about anything,
then I'm in the book,

06:03.656 --> 06:04.850
Mark Corrigan.

06:04.896 --> 06:07.127
'Too formal. Lighten things up.

06:08.418 --> 06:10.375
'Light, not slimy!

06:10.419 --> 06:13.537
'Ohh, can't retract the wink.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.856
'Unless... '

06:16.701 --> 06:19.092
See you.

06:19.143 --> 06:22.261
'Brilliant, the twitching freak. Works every time.'

06:23.865 --> 06:27.222
Who needs to go off to Amsterdam
paintballing in a go-kart?

06:27.266 --> 06:29.258
You know, that is such bullshit.

06:29.307 --> 06:34.224
No danger, my friend, no danger!
Just a load of old mates in the boozer loving it!

06:34.269 --> 06:37.707
Hans, is it perhaps time
we had a word with Jeremy?

06:37.751 --> 06:41.506
Oh, yeah. Jez, listen...
Oi, oi, tequila slammers!

06:42.833 --> 06:45.632
Three, two, one, lift-off!

06:49.436 --> 06:53.511
- Mate, aren't you gonna slam?
- I don't drink, it's a Buddhist thing.

06:53.558 --> 06:55.550
What's his name again?

06:55.599 --> 06:57.511
Sam, mate of Darren's.

06:57.560 --> 07:01.600
Come on, it's a stag night.
You gotta slam on a stag night. Slam, slam!

07:01.641 --> 07:06.034
Slam, slam, slam, slam, slam!

07:07.564 --> 07:09.396
Aah!!

07:11.606 --> 07:15.760
Ouch.
I'm thinking maybe Buddha wasn't too pleased.

07:19.329 --> 07:21.366
When are you gonna say something, Super Hans?

07:21.410 --> 07:24.961
I don't know, Mark. I'm having second thoughts.
He seems really happy.

07:25.012 --> 07:28.085
Come on, you said it. She's Yoko, remember?

07:28.133 --> 07:32.606
Wa-hey, guys!
Sam's gonna be out in an hour or two so...

07:32.655 --> 07:34.089
Night to remember or what?

07:34.136 --> 07:35.570
Yeah.

07:37.818 --> 07:42.176
Listen, Jez, there's something I've been meaning
to tell ya that I didn't wanna tell ya.

07:42.219 --> 07:45.497
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's about Nancy.

07:45.541 --> 07:47.931
I know you two aren't doing it,

07:47.982 --> 07:50.133
and it must've got to her, cos...

07:51.304 --> 07:53.260
the other day,

07:53.304 --> 07:55.500
she sucked me off...

07:55.545 --> 07:57.537
while I was having a widdle.

07:57.586 --> 07:59.305
What?

07:59.347 --> 08:03.900
Yeah. Not just as, obviously, but, er, right after.

08:03.949 --> 08:07.341
I didn't want to -
she's obviously into that sort of thing.

08:07.391 --> 08:09.348
It was pretty disgusting.

08:09.392 --> 08:13.990
- I don't believe you.
- Seriously. I wouldn't lie about a thing like this.

08:14.034 --> 08:16.629
Anyway, Mark saw the whole thing.

08:18.476 --> 08:19.591
Mark?

08:19.636 --> 08:25.908
Yep. I wouldn't've believed it,
but I saw the whole darn shooting match.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.187
Really?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.117
'Fraid so. Definitely.

08:30.321 --> 08:32.517
Fuck, I can't believe she'd do something like that.

08:33.562 --> 08:36.157
Jez, cheer up, you'll get over her.

08:36.203 --> 08:40.198
How could she do something like that to me?
God...

08:40.245 --> 08:42.520
I love her.

08:42.566 --> 08:44.558
I really love her.

08:45.888 --> 08:47.880
What am I gonna do?

08:49.249 --> 08:54.531
You'll have forgotten her in a week.
You know what you're like, you big idiot.

08:55.972 --> 09:00.650
Everything's turned from gold... into shit.

09:16.541 --> 09:20.536
- Jez?
- Yeah?

09:20.663 --> 09:22.655
It-It was...

09:22.704 --> 09:24.263
a joke.

09:24.305 --> 09:26.866
A joke?

09:26.906 --> 09:28.863
Yeah, we... we were joking.

09:28.907 --> 09:32.868
She didn't suck his widdle. It was a put-on.

09:32.909 --> 09:35.629
Yeah. We stagged ya,

09:35.670 --> 09:37.741
good and proper.

09:37.791 --> 09:39.987
Oh, right.

09:40.032 --> 09:44.550
<i>Brilliant. Yeah, you fucking... guys.</i>

09:45.554 --> 09:47.273
You got me all right.

09:47.315 --> 09:51.276
Yeah... brilliant.

09:57.240 --> 10:00.392
'There he goes, dead man walking.

10:00.441 --> 10:02.398
'I tried, I failed.

10:02.442 --> 10:06.835
'Got to let him make his own mistakes
like Dad did with me and the Strimmer.'

10:06.884 --> 10:09.718
- She looks lovely, doesn't she?
- Yeah.

10:09.765 --> 10:13.840
Jesus, didn't realise
I was with the fucking Nancy Appreciation Society.

10:13.887 --> 10:17.278
Tony, if you'd like to bang her,
why don't you just say it?

10:17.328 --> 10:21.323
OK. I would like to bang her.

10:24.011 --> 10:25.764
Hi, we're here to get married.

10:25.812 --> 10:28.168
Just one thing before we start.

10:28.213 --> 10:33.529
To be different, when I'm meant
to say "I do," I want to say "Do I."

10:33.576 --> 10:38.413
- I'm sorry?
- You know, "Do I?" as in "Do I ever?!"

10:38.458 --> 10:40.290
You should've spoken to someone
about this before.

10:40.339 --> 10:43.332
No, but "Do I?" as in "Do I?!"

10:43.380 --> 10:48.058
I'm sorry, he's just excited.
We're both so happy to be getting married.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.584
'Where's Sophie? She said she'd be here.

10:51.624 --> 10:55.061
'Don't get hung up, Mark. It's over. Case closed.'

10:55.105 --> 10:57.415
Do you take Nancy as your wife

10:57.466 --> 11:00.824
and promise to walk by her side for ever

11:00.868 --> 11:04.658
as her best friend, her lover and her soul mate?

11:04.710 --> 11:06.063
Do I?!

11:06.110 --> 11:07.021
Say "I do."

11:07.071 --> 11:08.823
I do.

11:12.993 --> 11:15.462
It was a lovely service, wasn't it?

11:15.514 --> 11:19.111
I know some people
go for that country church vibe,

11:19.156 --> 11:23.276
but we were "Who's this wedding for,
us or the tourist board?"

11:23.318 --> 11:25.150
Hey, Nance. You've met Auntie Helen.

11:25.199 --> 11:27.919
Hi. Jez, I've got great news.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.360
Oh, brilliant, what?

11:29.401 --> 11:32.758
The health club called - the receptionist job?

11:32.802 --> 11:35.715
I'm underqualified but if I make it
there by four they'll consider me.

11:35.763 --> 11:39.235
Oh, OK... You're not going?

11:40.726 --> 11:43.560
No, obviously, yeah, you must go.

11:44.687 --> 11:46.087
See you later, Jez.

11:46.128 --> 11:48.279
See you later, Mrs Osborne.

11:48.929 --> 11:52.321
Health club interview. It's a biggie.

11:52.371 --> 11:54.840
Really hope she gets it.

11:55.892 --> 11:59.569
Anyway... on with the wedding.

11:59.614 --> 12:00.649
Jez, you all right?

12:00.694 --> 12:04.006
<i>Super Hans has taken four grams
of coke to relax him for his speech.</i>

12:04.056 --> 12:05.331
It didn't relax him?

12:11.059 --> 12:14.337
- Everything's fucked.
- Calm down, it's gonna be OK.

12:14.381 --> 12:16.019
Maybe you were right, Mark.

12:16.061 --> 12:20.773
This wedding's all wrong. It's against God
and man and the rule of law and nature.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.019
Listen, it's your special day,

12:23.064 --> 12:29.984
and even if I have to die of anxiety making an
off-the-cuff speech, we're gonna keep it special.

12:36.670 --> 12:39.823
So... ladies and gentlemen,

12:39.872 --> 12:44.470
you'll forgive me,
I haven't prepared a proper speech,

12:44.514 --> 12:49.749
but then perhaps that's appropriate,
since this isn't a proper wedding...

12:49.796 --> 12:52.517
or so the cynics may say.

12:52.558 --> 12:54.549
But I say to those cynics,

12:54.598 --> 12:57.956
"Listen, cynics, this is the modern world,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.156
"and just because
it's new and strange and unnerving

13:03.202 --> 13:05.797
"doesn't mean it's not brilliant."

13:08.285 --> 13:11.517
In Ancient Rome, they had Cupid.

13:11.566 --> 13:15.004
In modern days, it's the Home Office.

13:15.048 --> 13:17.279
Love is blind.

13:17.329 --> 13:20.322
That's not a joke about David Blunkett.

13:21.450 --> 13:25.240
No, seriously, I would never make that joke.

13:25.292 --> 13:29.526
So I say to Jeremy and... Where's Nancy?

13:29.574 --> 13:31.930
Job interview, health club. It's a biggie.

13:33.216 --> 13:35.172
Oh. OK.

13:35.216 --> 13:39.211
I say to Nancy, "Good luck with the interview"

13:39.258 --> 13:41.489
and I say to Jeremy

13:41.539 --> 13:43.849
"Good luck with the marriage."

13:43.900 --> 13:49.261
And I think the rest of us can unite
in saying, "Two fingers to the cynics"

13:49.303 --> 13:54.095
and raising our glasses... to true love.

13:54.145 --> 13:55.738
True love.

13:55.786 --> 13:59.496
And this first number is for Jez and Nancy.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.539
<i>Solid as a rock</i>

14:03.149 --> 14:05.106
<i>That's what this...</i>

14:05.150 --> 14:08.986
I shouldn't have to be a machine
in bed just because I meditate.

14:09.032 --> 14:10.670
Hey, Mark, how's it going? >

14:10.712 --> 14:13.307
Hey, Karen, good. And you?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.389
Good, thanks.

14:14.434 --> 14:16.630
It was good to see you in Gino's.

14:16.675 --> 14:18.871
Got over the twitch, by the way.

14:18.916 --> 14:21.192
Next time I have acupuncture
I'll get someone else to do it for me.

14:22.117 --> 14:24.678
'Look at me go, I'm charming! '

14:24.719 --> 14:27.473
So sorry if I was acting a bit weird.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.674
I just wanted to see
if you wanted to hang out some time.

14:31.722 --> 14:33.075
That sounds nice.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.673
'I'm a natural! Maybe I should try it
on someone better looking.'

14:36.724 --> 14:38.317
Hey, Mark. Karen.

14:38.365 --> 14:40.321
- Sophie!
- Sorry I'm late.

14:40.365 --> 14:42.277
Are you all right?

14:42.326 --> 14:46.082
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just been breaking up with Jeff.

14:46.128 --> 14:47.562
Oh, God, Soph, really?

14:47.609 --> 14:51.000
Yeah. It's all actually finally over.

14:51.050 --> 14:53.964
Oh, Soph, I'm sorry, that's terrible.

14:54.012 --> 14:55.161
'That wasn't convincing.'

14:55.212 --> 14:57.169
It's probably for the best.

14:57.213 --> 15:00.890
Anyway, let's get pissed. Bollocks to love!

15:00.935 --> 15:02.050
Bollocks to love!

15:02.095 --> 15:04.690
'Oh, God, I love you. I love you so much.'

15:04.736 --> 15:07.457
So, you two are getting on well.

15:07.498 --> 15:10.093
Yeah, we just arranged to go out.

15:10.139 --> 15:12.495
Oh, right, great.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.577
But why don't you come too, Soph?

15:14.621 --> 15:18.855
- With the both of you?
- No, no, obviously, come along with... Sam!

15:18.903 --> 15:20.541
- This is Sam.
- Hi.

15:20.583 --> 15:24.863
You two have loads in common.
Sam's a single Buddhist.

15:24.905 --> 15:28.456
Just as long as you know
I'm not a Tantric superman.

15:28.507 --> 15:31.022
OK, why the hell not?

15:31.068 --> 15:32.057
Oh, this will be fun.

15:32.108 --> 15:37.743
'She's only been single for a few minutes
but already you've found her a new boyfriend.

15:37.791 --> 15:39.942
'Nice work, Mr Fucking Stupid.'

15:41.593 --> 15:46.589
Hey, guys? What about if we move this chair
from here over to here?

15:46.635 --> 15:49.355
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

15:49.396 --> 15:55.349
Mark, what do you think?
My wife was saying maybe move that to there.

15:55.399 --> 15:57.391
Sure, whatever.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.154
Yeah, great one, Nance, brilliant.

16:01.321 --> 16:04.315
<i>Dooby dooby dooby dooby doo</i>

16:04.363 --> 16:07.800
<i>Dooby dooby dooby dooby doo...</i>

16:07.844 --> 16:13.046
Nancy, it's lovely, your dooby-dooing,
but could you wait till this ends?

16:13.087 --> 16:15.841
Do I dooby-doo? I didn't think I did.

16:15.888 --> 16:17.766
- You do.
- Really?

16:17.809 --> 16:21.598
You definitely do.
You were dooby-doing all over the place.

16:21.651 --> 16:24.246
If you think I was, I'll stop.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.281
She definitely was.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.290
I know. We know.

16:29.334 --> 16:31.371
It's OK. We know.

16:35.377 --> 16:40.692
So how do you feel it's going, Jez?
What do you make of media sales?

16:40.739 --> 16:44.654
I feel like every day quite a big part of me dies...

16:44.701 --> 16:46.054
forever.

16:46.101 --> 16:50.335
- Yeah. Still, welcome to the real world.
- Yeah. You keep saying that.

16:50.383 --> 16:53.980
So, er... how's the marriage?

16:54.025 --> 16:56.699
Oh, good. Pretty good.

16:56.746 --> 16:58.624
You don't sound 110% there.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.624
No, no, it's brilliant.

17:00.668 --> 17:04.025
Obviously there are sometimes... niggles.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.345
Niggles? That doesn't sound good.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.268
It's all about compromise.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.951
Compromise, niggles? Jesus, Jez.

17:10.992 --> 17:16.194
You don't think? Isn't it normal
for there to be little differences?

17:16.234 --> 17:18.590
No. What sort of things are niggling?

17:18.636 --> 17:21.992
Stupid stuff. What DVDs we watch.

17:22.037 --> 17:26.954
Oh, stupid stuff like what you do
with your free time. Your life!

17:27.000 --> 17:28.398
Sounds like you're in a hellhole.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.001
It's true, it is kind of annoying.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.682
Last night we had to watch a whole
load of Robin Williams' movies.

17:33.723 --> 17:36.033
Oh, Robin Williams? That sap?

17:36.084 --> 17:38.679
She likes him? That is so sappy.

17:40.846 --> 17:44.601
The guy is a stupid little... gherkin

17:44.647 --> 17:46.161
and so's anyone who likes him.

17:46.208 --> 17:50.203
Yeah. He is a bit like a gherkin.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.003
You know what you should do?

17:52.051 --> 17:54.202
Get some Jim Carrey DVDs?

17:54.252 --> 17:55.480
Have an affair.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.727
What?!

17:56.773 --> 17:59.766
Come on! Welcome to the real world.

17:59.814 --> 18:01.771
Can you please stop doing that?

18:01.815 --> 18:05.332
You think people don't have affairs?
Everyone does.

18:05.377 --> 18:08.927
Mummy, Daddy, me, you... John Major.

18:08.978 --> 18:09.570
No, but...

18:09.619 --> 18:14.217
Oh, affairs are great.
They're simple and no-one gets hurt.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.455
They're simple?

18:15.501 --> 18:19.098
Sure! As simple as me closing the door.

18:19.703 --> 18:23.095
And then putting my hand down your trousers.

18:28.107 --> 18:33.661
And I was like, "You don't have to
be enlightened to work here but it helps."

18:33.709 --> 18:37.420
'Sophie's eating up his whole Buddhist schtick.

18:37.471 --> 18:41.148
'Got to stick it out.
Keep being charming to Sophie,

18:41.193 --> 18:45.073
'stay cold to Karen,
without breaking social convention.'

18:45.114 --> 18:47.185
Who's that?

18:47.235 --> 18:49.670
Hello? Jeff?

18:50.957 --> 18:55.032
'Oh, Jesus, don't kill me,
I'm not her date. Kill him.

18:55.079 --> 18:56.353
'Actually, that'd be perfect.'

18:56.399 --> 18:59.598
- You moved on pretty fucking quick.
- Now's not the time to talk about it.

18:59.641 --> 19:02.395
I've just come to pick up some stuff.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.397
Don't mind me.

19:03.442 --> 19:08.803
'Yeah, right, don't mind the maniac!
How are we supposed to not mind him? '

19:08.845 --> 19:11.121
So, er... old question,

19:11.166 --> 19:13.920
but John or Paul, who was the best?

19:13.967 --> 19:16.641
Paul, obviously, but for the sake of argument.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.680
That's mine, pal.

19:18.729 --> 19:23.566
'Shit. This is just not normal.
Someone's gotta do something.

19:23.611 --> 19:28.050
'He's gonna do nothing
like Jeff's the invading Chinese army.

19:28.093 --> 19:30.973
'They're... women, that old get-out.

19:31.015 --> 19:33.246
'Oh, God, it's gotta be me.'

19:33.416 --> 19:35.726
Listen, Jeff,

19:35.777 --> 19:40.330
I er... I think, you know, it's time you left.

19:40.939 --> 19:42.896
Oh, really?

19:42.940 --> 19:44.977
And what are you gonna do about it exactly?

19:45.021 --> 19:46.933
What am I gonna do?

19:46.982 --> 19:48.381
'What am I gonna do?! '

19:49.743 --> 19:53.784
Nothing... except stand here like a civilised man

19:53.825 --> 19:58.298
and wait for you to do
the civilised thing and leave.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.547
Yeah, well, I'll just be getting
some CDs out the bedroom.

20:08.631 --> 20:12.262
'Brilliant. Probably looks
like I was ready to punch him

20:12.313 --> 20:15.112
'when actually I was gonna use
the Buddhist as a human shield.'

20:18.276 --> 20:20.108
Wow, Nance, this is amazing.

20:20.157 --> 20:23.628
You've been so sweet putting up
with me and my dumb sappy movies.

20:23.678 --> 20:30.234
Mom called. She's so pissed we got
married I thought she was gonna shit.

20:30.281 --> 20:31.351
Oh.

20:31.402 --> 20:34.201
But, um... it kinda got me thinking.

20:35.203 --> 20:39.244
I mean, although this
obviously isn't a real marriage,

20:39.285 --> 20:42.084
it still is a marriage, obviously.

20:42.126 --> 20:46.360
I mean, legally, and therefore
probably in the eyes of God.

20:46.408 --> 20:49.208
But I thought you thought it was
just a stupid piece of paper.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.448
It is, but a potentially holy one.

20:52.491 --> 20:57.965
Anyway, I got thinking that those
feelings about guilt around sex,

20:58.013 --> 21:00.734
maybe they won't be such a problem any more.

21:00.775 --> 21:03.244
You mean we might start to...

21:03.296 --> 21:07.849
'Fuck niggles,
she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

21:07.898 --> 21:10.254
'Oh, God, why did I... with Toni?

21:10.299 --> 21:12.860
'Try and forget. Mash will help.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.973
'Mash will clog up my brain
and make everything all right.'

21:16.021 --> 21:18.742
Oh! You are gonna pay for that!

21:18.783 --> 21:19.898
En garde, monsieur.

21:23.065 --> 21:25.626
'Toni, shit, gotta deal with Toni.'

21:25.666 --> 21:29.421
Um, Nance, I'm really sorry but I've got to go.

21:29.467 --> 21:31.424
Oh. OK.

21:31.468 --> 21:35.145
Super Hans is thinking about
going back on the crack.

21:35.190 --> 21:40.425
I'll get him a Scotch egg.
That will usually take his mind off it.

21:42.713 --> 21:45.103
Look, Toni, this is...

21:45.154 --> 21:46.588
wrong.

21:46.635 --> 21:47.705
Why?

21:49.076 --> 21:50.635
Won't Tony be back soon?

21:50.677 --> 21:52.350
Tony's never coming back.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.311
- What?
- Tony ran for the hills.

21:55.359 --> 21:57.669
He's at home in Lincoln getting
his tummy rubbed by lovely Mummy.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.837
Shit.

21:59.881 --> 22:01.918
But me and Nancy, we're married and...

22:01.962 --> 22:04.523
Mm. What about me, Jeremy?
What about Toni?

22:04.563 --> 22:06.919
Where's my lollipop?

22:06.964 --> 22:10.197
Why should I have to go without a husband?

22:10.246 --> 22:14.160
Where's my piece of pie?
The farmer wants a wife, Jeremy.

22:15.328 --> 22:17.968
- Don't answer it.
- But it's Nancy.

22:18.009 --> 22:21.047
Do you want me to have a chat to her

22:21.090 --> 22:23.241
about you and your cock?

22:27.813 --> 22:30.613
- God, what a weird one.
- I know.

22:30.655 --> 22:32.726
So what do you think to Karen?

22:32.776 --> 22:35.337
- Oh, she's nice.
- Great.

22:35.377 --> 22:37.528
Really nice.

22:38.538 --> 22:41.292
She just... isn't...

22:41.339 --> 22:42.739
Isn't what?

22:42.780 --> 22:45.011
You.

22:48.703 --> 22:52.777
<i>I can't live</i>

22:52.824 --> 22:55.977
<i>If living is without you</i>

22:56.026 --> 22:59.576
<i>I can't give</i>

22:59.708 --> 23:02.507
<i>I can't give any more...</i>

23:02.549 --> 23:06.703
'Public humiliation. Welcome to my world, Jeff.

23:06.751 --> 23:09.869
'Although personally I wouldn't've
picked that dress to cry on.'

23:12.193 --> 23:14.867
<i>But I guess that's just the way...</i>

23:17.515 --> 23:19.472
Hey, Jez. Hey, Nance.

23:19.516 --> 23:22.316
Hey, Mark. Oh, there you go, hubby.

23:24.439 --> 23:25.428
How'd it go tonight?

23:25.479 --> 23:27.436
Ooh, pretty darn well!

23:27.480 --> 23:30.553
Nearly, really nearly,
finally got it together with Soph.

23:30.601 --> 23:32.957
Excellent.

23:33.002 --> 23:36.440
Oh, yes!
Now it's coming together, my friend.

23:36.484 --> 23:42.596
Look at you with your beautiful American wife
and me with my lovely maybe girlfriend.

23:42.647 --> 23:48.963
We should get a couple of tandems and go to
the Pyrenees and pick grapes or some crazy thing.

23:49.009 --> 23:52.321
Oh, Jez, could you sleep on the couch tonight?

23:52.371 --> 23:55.205
I'm on my way to see Metallica at Wembley Arena

23:55.252 --> 23:58.690
and I've taken a coupla Es so I'm
gonna start feeling pretty horny.

23:58.734 --> 24:04.652
And if I meet somebody, and I probably will,
we'll wanna come back and bone.

24:04.696 --> 24:06.688
So I'll need the bed.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.057
Later.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.055
See you later.

24:10.099 --> 24:13.137
Oh, by the way, we need milk. Later, Mark.

24:13.180 --> 24:15.741
Er, OK, later.

24:15.781 --> 24:20.061
'Metallica... milk? '

24:20.103 --> 24:22.254
Is everything all right?

24:22.304 --> 24:25.582
I had an affair with Toni by mistake

24:25.626 --> 24:28.903
and Nancy found out because I told her.

24:28.947 --> 24:30.939
Why?

24:31.949 --> 24:34.305
Because of stupid honesty.

24:34.350 --> 24:37.309
And now we're going to stay married

24:37.351 --> 24:42.632
but apparently our relationship
is nothing more than a husk.

24:42.673 --> 24:46.224
A husk? That doesn't sound good.

24:46.275 --> 24:51.635
Do you think maybe,
if I plead and plead and plead,

24:51.677 --> 24:57.596

and things will go back to like before?

24:57.640 --> 24:59.836
Honestly?

24:59.881 --> 25:04.195
Quite honestly,

25:04.243 --> 25:06.235
not brutally honestly.

25:07.644 --> 25:12.037
Then... yeah, absolutely.

25:13.687 --> 25:16.122
Cheers, mate.

25:16.168 --> 25:19.128
No problem, mate.

25:19.170 --> 25:22.481
<i>I can't live</i>

25:23.211 --> 25:26.205

25:30.174 --> 25:33.168
<i>I can't give any more</i>

25:33.896 --> 25:37.971
<i>I can't live</i>

25:38.018 --> 25:40.852
<i>If living is without you</i>

25:40.899 --> 25:44.530
<i>I can't give...</i>
