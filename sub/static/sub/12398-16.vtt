Then maybe there's someone else
you'd like to help.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.730
Nikita?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.608
Can you hear me?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.949
-Is that Fletcher?
-No, he's gone. Nikita was there.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.737
What did you do, Amanda?

14:34.916 --> 14:38.625
Have your techs splice together
some old recordings of Ryan's voice?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.205
RYAN:
No.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.997
Listen, the first time we met...

14:44.217 --> 14:47.300
...we were in that bunker in Chile.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.091
I asked who you were. You said, "Nikita. "

14:51.265 --> 14:53.756
You hung up on me.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.645
Ryan.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.328
You died. How?

15:16.499 --> 15:17.989
RYAN [OVER SPEAKERPHONE]:
Surprised me too.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.543
I mean, the part where l was alive.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.792
The dying thing I--

15:21.963 --> 15:24.454
I kind of saw that coming.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.382
You okay? She hasn't--?

15:28.553 --> 15:30.464
Oh. I'm still in one piece.

15:31.347 --> 15:36.341
Amanda's kept me alive to help her
work on her special projects.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.431
I really hope for his sake
that's not a euphemism.

15:40.565 --> 15:44.729
Here's the offer.
You bring me Percy, I'll give you Ryan.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.485
-Deal?
-Bring you Percy?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.609
AMANDA:
Unfortunately I need him alive...

15:50.783 --> 15:52.239
...to answer for his crimes.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.570
You got a deal.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.337
CAMERAMAN:
And rolling.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.623
Wow, just like I remember it.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.793
And yet the original actually
burned to the ground.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.633
How did you feel when you heard
Semak had constructed...

16:14.807 --> 16:16.923
...an exact replica
of your childhood home?

16:17.101 --> 16:20.639
It was very emotional.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.766
Now that I'm here,
I can feel my family's presence.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.276
Like my mother is upstairs
waiting for me right now.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.446
Maybe we should go through here.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.823
Right, my father's office.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.576
Not an exact replica.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.539
Mr. Pierce, I thought we discussed
the route of today's tour.

16:45.755 --> 16:50.215
-I'm sorry. I have a terrible memory.
-If you continue down that corridor...

16:50.384 --> 16:52.796
...you'll make your way to the conservatory.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.632
Thank you so much, Mr. Tasarov.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.395
Sonya, who's working on Caleb's
abduction case?

17:08.569 --> 17:09.900
My team is on standby.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.653
No one. Look at the monitors.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.570
-Amanda's got a special team on it.
-Who? What team?

17:16.786 --> 17:21.155
You should talk to Amanda.
I've got a lot of data to sort through here.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.843
What took you so long?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.628
Your old hard drives were a mess.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.423
I've seen hoarders
with better organizational systems.

17:41.102 --> 17:44.139
True genius cannot be contained.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.765
So it's official. We're working for Amanda.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.150
Technically I'm only working
with Sonya here.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.936
Nikita thought putting
our two giant brains together...

17:54.115 --> 17:56.197
gave us the best chance
of ﬁnding Percy.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.825
Sonya, you remember Carla. You guys
tried to have her killed last week.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.404
I found the file. What does it do?

18:03.583 --> 18:07.121
Well, when Nikki first came back to town,
this is before your time...

18:07.336 --> 18:11.420
...she kidnapped a certain, ahem,
Division asset.

18:11.591 --> 18:15.083
I've heard this story.
She left you duct-taped to a swing set.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.469
-Actually it was a rocking horse.
-Whatever.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.971
The point is she jammed my tracker.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.674
When I got back to Division...

18:22.852 --> 18:25.184
...I started working
on a back channel system.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.017
A way to find someone
even if their signal was being jammed.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.528
Have you tested this?
I don't see how it'll work.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.610
-The hardware would--
-Bah,bah,bah,bah,bah.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.571
It is not yours to question the genius.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.156
Only to marvel at it.

18:43.372 --> 18:47.365
Now, all I need from you is a frequency
for the missing agent.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.957
You can change his frequency later, after
we pull his ass out of Percy's frying pan.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.999
-If we find the agent--
-We find Percy. Your call.

19:11.150 --> 19:15.018
Amanda is using your sympathies
against you. Don't let her.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.437
I can't worry about
punishing Amanda now...

19:17.615 --> 19:21.028
...when I can save Ryan and get Percy
off the streets at the same time.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.444
This isn't about punishment
or revenge.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.495
It isn't.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.704
Look, in the right hands,
under the right leadership...

19:30.920 --> 19:33.787
...Division can save
so many more lives.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.001
Division is not a shield. It's a sword.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.588
And it bleeds everything it touches.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.783
We're sure his tracker can't
send out a signal?

20:11.961 --> 20:14.327
Been dead for almost an hour.
The chip is useless.

20:14.505 --> 20:18.248
Why take the chance?
Get that body out of here now.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.547
-Got him! Whoomp! There he is. Ha, ha, ha.
-So fast?

20:22.722 --> 20:25.338
I'm still not really sure
whatjust happened.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.599

22:46.824 --> 22:49.406
You've been working with Amanda.
Big victory for her.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.364
I know she was always pained
by your defection.

22:52.538 --> 22:56.281
It's a one-time deal.
I made an exception for you.

-How do you feel about that?
-I don't like it.
