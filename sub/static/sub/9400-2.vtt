<i>I hit you with the borrowed car,
and now I am going to kill you.</i>

00:08.600 --> 00:11.400
But first, I'm gonna get Jamie back.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.100
- I love you.
- Yes.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.400
- You didn't let me ask you.
- Yes, baby, yes.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.200
- This isn't right.
- No, it's.. it's okay. It is.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.700
I just want to be your wife.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.500
<i>This is supposed
to be a dream come true.</i>

00:24.800 --> 00:26.600
- You right. We just gonna have to go public.
- Yeah.

00:26.700 --> 00:27.800
I'm gonna say, "Nate, look,

00:27.900 --> 00:32.400
I'm dating your mom.. sleeping with her,
doing all kind of freaky stuff to her."

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
You want to tell him or should I?

00:33.900 --> 00:36.200
What's up? What's up? There it is.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.600
For the first time, I, uh...
felt like I was on my way back.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.600
I'm so glad for you, Nathan.

00:40.700 --> 00:44.400
Hey, daddy, when you play in the NBA,
you should play for the Bobcats.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.600
Q says they need a shooting guard.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.100
You and Q. Come here.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.500
- It's my company.
- No, it's our company.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.000
- Without my designs, you have nothing.
- We'll see about that.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.700
<i>I want you to lock it. She's not
getting anywhere near the new line.</i>

"Lucas Scott, if you break
that box spring,

01:40.815 --> 01:44.202
you're gonna be sleeping on
the floor the rest of your life."

01:45.400 --> 01:48.200
Well, here's the good news.

01:48.300 --> 01:53.600
If you have to sleep on the floor,
I'll sleep there with you.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.700
For the rest of your life?

01:56.100 --> 01:58.100
Definitely.

Jamie Scott, if you break
that box spring,

02:25.036 --> 02:27.000
you're sleeping on the floor
the rest of your life.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.400
And get ready for school, you goof.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.600
Good morning.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.700
Skills! What are you doing here? Hi!

02:42.000 --> 02:43.700
Haley James Scott,
good morning, baby girl.

02:43.785 --> 02:45.703
Hey, I was just in the neighborhood

02:45.785 --> 02:48.622
and thought maybe Nathan could
use a ride to morning practice.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.300
It's because of Deb, isn't it?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.100
What?

02:54.200 --> 02:55.900
You don't fool me, Skills.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.900
Look, mouth and millicent are out of town.
Nathan told you what a great cook Deb is.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.400
I get it. Come on in.
Breakfast is served.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.700
Hey, can't fool you, Hales.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.700
What are you doing here?

03:09.800 --> 03:13.600
Just picking up Nathan...
and kissing your sexy ass.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.900
Well, breakfast is served.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.000
- Hey, uncle Skills.
- Hey. There he is.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.400
Um, let me check.

03:25.900 --> 03:30.700
Oh, yeah, I-I-I think you're good.
She just had some, uh... yeah, she good.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.600
Good morning, grandma.

03:33.900 --> 03:37.000
- "Nanny Deb."
- Nanny Deb.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.100
Okay, well, I'm gonna just, uh...

03:40.200 --> 03:45.400
you know... hey, lock it up,
little man. All right.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.800
See you later, grandma.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.800
Right.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.300
Well, um... let's get you
some breakfast.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.800
And they thought the last
nanny was crazy.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.200
Breakfast is served.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.200
You're gonna need to eat if you want
to get big and strong before I kill you.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.500
Still can't talk, huh?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.600
You are, like, the perfect man.

04:21.700 --> 04:26.100
I mean, if you were younger
and better-looking.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.300
No biting.

04:40.400 --> 04:46.200
Oh, okay. Here comes the choo-choo.
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.800
Do people just kiss all the time?

04:57.300 --> 04:59.700
If they love each other.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
Do you love uncle Skills?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.100
What? W-why?

05:04.200 --> 05:08.900
- You were kissing him.
- Uh, n-no. No, I wasn't. When?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.200
This morning, in the kitchen.

05:11.500 --> 05:17.400
No, no, honey. I-I had something in my eye,
and he was helping me get it out.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.100
With his mouth?

05:19.200 --> 05:21.700
Jamie, I was not kissing uncle Skills.

05:21.800 --> 05:26.400
I mean, first of all, he's your parents' age
and one of uncle Lucas' best friends.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.200
It-It just.. it wouldn't be right.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.600
I think it'd be cool.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.300
"Grandpa Skills."

05:49.800 --> 05:52.200
Hey, we got to release way
sooner than that.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.100
If we don't get out ahead of the ball,
we might as well forget about it.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.100
Now, can anybody get
this thing right?

05:57.200 --> 05:59.200
I'll give it a shot.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.900
It's about time.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.300
Q, you got a new shooting guard.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.100
All right.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.300
Okay.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
years from now,

06:11.755 --> 06:14.961
you'll be able to tell your
friends you was in the gym

06:15.057 --> 06:18.523
the day Nathan Scott got
back in the game!

06:19.100 --> 06:21.200
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

06:21.300 --> 06:23.200
Just give me the ball
and get out of the way.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.900
Eight seconds and the shot goes up.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.433
Skins, we block out,
kick the ball to Q,

06:27.506 --> 06:29.263
fill the lanes, and push it.

06:29.335 --> 06:30.223
All right? Let's go.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
Go, go, go!

06:50.600 --> 06:54.000
Don't call it a comeback, baby.
Don't do that.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.900
How was breakfast?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.400
- So damn good.
<i>- Good.</i>

06:59.425 --> 07:00.503
Hey, will you remind Quentin

07:00.555 --> 07:02.880
that he's got a tutoring session
after practice today?

07:03.100 --> 07:04.300
- Yeah, I will.
<i>- Okay, thank you.</i>

07:04.400 --> 07:06.100
- How's he doing?
- Great, actually.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.600
He's doing better with "les mis"
than I did in high school.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, that's great... whatever that is.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.400
Somebody getting sexy!

07:22.500 --> 07:25.000
He's right about that. That boy
looks damn good on a basketball court.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.000
Hey, 23...

07:28.100 --> 07:29.700
call me.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.700
Damn, I got to change
my jersey number.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.700
I'll see you later.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.600
Hey, Haley. How's Luke doing?

07:37.700 --> 07:40.900
Something tells me
Lucas is gonna be just fine...

07:50.100 --> 07:52.400
Ooh! Excuse me.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.300
It's okay. We're getting married.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.300
Thanks.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.900
Um, okay. So...

08:03.000 --> 08:06.700
you know how you said our wedding
should be a dream come true?

08:07.100 --> 08:08.200
Oh, boy.

08:08.300 --> 08:12.200
I just.. I never wanted my wedding
to be like "princess for a day,"

08:12.300 --> 08:17.600
but I do think it would be fun
to have your mom there and..

08:21.400 --> 08:24.300
It's Brooke. Can I tell her?

08:25.400 --> 08:29.700
Sure. You can tell her we're
coming home for the ceremony.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.100
Hey, best friend!

08:31.200 --> 08:33.500
<i>Hi. You didn't come home again.</i>

08:33.600 --> 08:38.200
Oh, yeah, well, that's 'cause
I'm in L.A with Lucas.

08:38.299 --> 08:41.500
And we wanted you
to be the first to know...

08:41.600 --> 08:43.900
we're getting married.

08:44.700 --> 08:48.800
That's great, Peyton. I, uh...

08:50.200 --> 08:53.400
I'm just.. I'm at the store,
and someone needs help.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.800
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, okay.
Um, you sure everything's okay?</i>

08:56.900 --> 09:01.900
Yeah. I'm just really happy for you.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.600
I got to go.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.800
Hi. It's Brooke.

09:28.516 --> 09:31.093
I know this probably seems
out of the blue,

09:31.486 --> 09:33.791
but do you think you could
meet me at my store?

09:41.800 --> 09:43.900
I thought you were gonna
come meet me.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.700
I chickened out.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.800
You're just gonna have to join
the mile-high club on your own.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.000
I just kind of did.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

09:53.300 --> 09:57.800
So, um... when would you like
to get married, Peyton Sawyer?

09:58.500 --> 10:02.900
Oh, I love that question.
Um... I don't know.

10:03.100 --> 10:06.300
Why don't we find a place we both like,
and then we could pick a date?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.900
Okay.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.600
Well, until then, how do you feel
about living in sin, moving in with me?

10:13.786 --> 10:15.973
Well, considering the last 48 hours,

10:16.055 --> 10:18.810
I'm pretty sure we already
have been living in sin.

10:19.200 --> 10:24.400
Um... yeah. I'd love to.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.000
I do want to spend one more
night with Brooke, though.

10:29.300 --> 10:34.400
She sounded sad on the phone,
and I'm gonna miss her.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.200
You got it.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.700
My god.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.600
- Brooke?
- Hi.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.400
Honey, what.. what happened?
Were you robbed?

11:03.100 --> 11:04.900
Yeah.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.700
Last night.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.100
Oh, my god.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.300
I'm not gonna cry.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.400
Oh, it's okay.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.200
I'm not gonna cry.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.300
- Hey, baby. How was school?
- Pretty good.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.200
Come on.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.300
Hey.. grandpa Dan.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.300
Come on. Let's go.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.700
What's up, man? What's up, boy?

12:13.900 --> 12:16.900
My god, man.
You are getting it back.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.300
- Slowly but surely.
- Slowly? Dude, you're playing like me.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.200
- Hi, boys.
- Hey.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.400
Oh, yeah.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.400
I said they call him J Lucas
so put up your dukes..

12:28.500 --> 12:32.200
the boy blowin' up and
the boy done shook us, hey!

12:32.300 --> 12:34.600
They call him Q fields he's
a pretty big deal

12:34.700 --> 12:38.300
he's working my corner
he's keeping it real.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.000
Give me some.

12:44.900 --> 12:48.300
Man, it looks so much cooler when
you're rocking that cape, man.

12:48.900 --> 12:52.400
Whoo! Yeah, I see.
I like that, man.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.700
I wish I had me one of them.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
That's hot.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.700
Wait a second.
I brought you something, man.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.000
I got you a little something.
Hold on one second.

13:05.800 --> 13:10.400
Hey. Dan was at school again today.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.600
It just bothers me that he
keeps coming around.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.800
Check this out.

13:17.600 --> 13:21.300
Now, when I was a kid, I used to put
all my little treasures in here.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.700
See that? Hmm? Now you can, too.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.100
Cool! Thanks, Q!

13:26.200 --> 13:28.700
Oh, man, it was nothing.
You got it.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.200
Q, I'm gonna be in my classroom.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.500
All right, I'll be right there, miss H.J.S.

13:33.800 --> 13:38.700
All right, baller, I got to go, man, but, uh...
see if you can beat your dad in that cape.

13:39.300 --> 13:43.400
Oh, yeah, it's easy. It's nothing.
Yeah. You can do it.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.600
It's a pretty cool gift, huh?

13:46.300 --> 13:48.300
Let's see what you got, dr. J.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.600
Yes! Nothing but net.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Did you call the police?

14:06.100 --> 14:08.200
No, and I don't want to.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.300
Brooke, you have to file a police report, or
your insurance company won't accept the claim.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.900
I don't want to. I have
plenty of money for this.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.100
Well, do you know what's missing?

14:20.500 --> 14:25.700
The computer, cash from the register,
and the sketches for my new line.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.500
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.300
But I really think we need
to call the police.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.400
No. I don't want the press
involved in this.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.900
So you can't tell anyone, okay?

14:37.000 --> 14:41.700
Not Haley and Nathan
or Peyton or anyone.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Please.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.000
Okay.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.000
Thank you.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.600
Come here.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.400
Deb, you own a gun, right?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.800
I do.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.100
I want you to teach me
how to use it.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.100
Jamie was happy to see you
at school today.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.200
Haley didn't look very pleased, though.

15:24.200 --> 15:30.000
Pretty soon, when Jamie goes missing, she'll
remember that grandpa Dan kept coming around.

15:30.800 --> 15:36.700
As a matter of fact, she saw
his car there practically every day.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.400
How does it feel to be
the prime suspect, huh?

15:55.400 --> 15:57.100
What's on your mind, Skills?

15:57.300 --> 15:59.400
Oh, nothing.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
Actually, when you first started dating Haley,
how hard was that for you to keep that from Lucas?

16:05.100 --> 16:07.000
Not very hard.

16:07.100 --> 16:11.100
It was probably harder for Haley 'cause
they were friends, but I didn't like Lucas.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.800
You didn't like uncle Lucas?

16:15.200 --> 16:18.100
It was a long time ago, big ears.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.800
Why? Where's your head?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.500
Just thinking about
the rules of it all, you know..

16:24.000 --> 16:26.800
how sometimes the heart just
wants what it wants.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.900
So, what's going on, Skills?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.200
You sneaking around with some
hot girl and not telling us?

16:32.600 --> 16:36.000
Yeah, what's going on, Skills?

16:38.200 --> 16:41.500
Hey. My ears aren't that big.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.700
Well, mr. Fields, you've certainly
come a long way.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.300
It almost seems as though you're
starting to enjoy "les misérables."

16:54.500 --> 16:56.200
Oh, come on, now.
Don't get crazy on me.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.500
You asked me to read the book,
and I'm reading the book.

16:58.600 --> 17:03.700
I've also noticed how you are with
Jamie and Nathan. I appreciate it.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.099
I'm telling you, man. Jamie, that kid
right there, he is gonna be the man.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.500
I'm serious. He already
got some things going for him.

17:10.599 --> 17:14.400
Well, I think he likes it that the star of
the basketball team makes him feel special.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.900
Well, I gota little brother his age.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.500
Yeah, he always watching me and
copying me and whatever. I just..

17:23.599 --> 17:29.000
I don't know. I just try to keep it fun for him
before he grows up and life gets harder.

17:33.200 --> 17:38.400
Quentin, what do you want to do
with your life? Besides basketball.

17:38.700 --> 17:42.300
Besides basketball... I don't know,
I guess, uh...

17:43.100 --> 17:47.300
get married, raise a family.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.200
Yeah? You want kids?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.300
I mean, I think about it sometimes.

17:52.400 --> 17:57.300
When I look at my little brother
or when I see J Luke, I don't know.

17:57.400 --> 18:03.700
I think maybe I'll have a son of my own
someday or, you know, a little girl.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.300
- That'd be all right.
- Yeah.

18:09.900 --> 18:13.400
Well, like I said, you've
certainly come a long way.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.300
A-plus, mr. Fields.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.700
- A-plus?
- A-plus.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.000
What? I got A..

18:24.400 --> 18:25.900
Nice.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.300
So, I guess this means I get to go
ahead and stop reading this book?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.500
No.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.300
I not even.. I can't...

18:37.200 --> 18:40.000
Okay, that's good.
Just a little lower now.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.400
Okay.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.300
Ahh. Perfect.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.700
- Hi.
- Hi, mama.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.700
What is this? I won't let you hop on the bed,
so you're hopping on the pop?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.900
It's fun. You should try it.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Maybe I will.

18:56.900 --> 19:01.200
- Hey, um, where's Deb?
- I have no idea, again.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.400
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:08.100 --> 19:12.400
- Um, I-I don't have very long.
- Oh, okay.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.100
Sorry. How was your day?

19:19.500 --> 19:22.200
I had to lie to Jamie about us.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.300
Then... something else happened.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.600
Wait. Come on. Sit down.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.800
What's going on?

19:31.400 --> 19:34.400
Well, I-I can't really talk about it,
but, um...

19:34.900 --> 19:39.400
I have a friend who's going through
some really emotional stuff.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.400
And she wants me to keep it a secret.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.500
Okay.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.800
I'm just not sure I should.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.200
Well, how'd you find out about it?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.300
She called me.

19:53.500 --> 19:57.300
Well, without knowing the situation,
I'd say that she called you for a reason.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.000
And if she ain't really tell nobody else about it,
then that means that she respects you

20:01.200 --> 20:06.900
and probably thinks that you're the one person
that just might understand what she going through.

20:07.700 --> 20:11.600
Yeah. That makes a lot of sense.

20:11.700 --> 20:14.400
I mean, is there anything I can do?

20:15.300 --> 20:17.500
You just did it.

20:17.600 --> 20:24.200
Hey. We just had our first
real conversation.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.900
- It was nice.
- Yeah, it was kind of nice, huh?

20:29.100 --> 20:32.200
I mean, it wasn't better than
that cheerleading outfit, but...

20:34.300 --> 20:36.500
It was nice.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.100
Brooke, I'm home!

20:45.200 --> 20:49.100
- Okay, don't freak out.
- Why?

20:54.000 --> 20:57.800
Oh, my god.
Brooke, what happened?

20:58.800 --> 21:04.400
Lindsey came by and said, "Peyton's a bitch."
And I said, "Peyton is not a bitch."

21:04.600 --> 21:09.400
And she said, "yes, she is." And I said,
"well, maybe you're the bitch, bitch." And...

21:11.900 --> 21:14.500
but you should see her face.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.100
Brooke...

21:18.100 --> 21:22.800
I was doing laundry, and I got all
tangled up in one of the sheets,

21:22.900 --> 21:27.400
and I fell face-first
down the stairs.

21:27.500 --> 21:32.200
Oh, honey. I'm sorry I wasn't here.
Why didn't you call me?

21:32.500 --> 21:37.100
I did, but you said you
were getting married.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.300
Is that why you sounded
so bad on the phone?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.700
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.700
- Really, I'm too sore to hug.
- Okay.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.600
- But congratulations.
- Thanks.

21:51.700 --> 21:55.200
- It's kind of sudden, right?
- Are you kidding?

21:55.300 --> 21:59.000
The rest of the world's been waiting
on you two idiots since high school.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
- He asked me to move in with him.
- Really?

22:04.600 --> 22:07.200
Do married people do that?

22:12.800 --> 22:15.900
I really am happy for you, P. Sawyer.

22:16.800 --> 22:22.400
I might be a little happier if it was your bony
ass that fell down the stairs, but still...

22:23.000 --> 22:27.400
- I'm gonna miss this.
- Me too.

22:42.800 --> 22:47.100
I smell a little monster
sneaking up behind me.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.000
What's up, beastie boy?

22:52.100 --> 22:55.400
- Can you help me make a cape?
- Sure. How come?

22:55.600 --> 23:01.000
Well, Quentin really likes mine, and I thought
maybe we could make one for him, too.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.800
I think that's a very nice idea.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.200
I'd be happy to help you, sir.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.900
Do you smell that?

23:10.200 --> 23:13.600
- No.
- I-I smell a bigger monster.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.000
Uncle Lucas!

23:18.000 --> 23:19.200
You're getting heavy.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.900
Did you know that daddy
didn't like you once?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.300
What? When?

23:24.400 --> 23:28.600
When he was dating mama.
I have big ears.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.300
Good looking out.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.900
Kid's got my back.

23:35.400 --> 23:40.200
So, speaking of sneaking around, uh,
where have you been the last few days?

23:42.200 --> 23:44.300
With Peyton, maybe?

23:45.100 --> 23:47.300
Actually, we're engaged.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.700
Get out!

23:50.900 --> 23:53.400
Dude, I just shaved your head from
your last engagement gone wrong!

23:53.500 --> 23:55.900
I know. I know it sounds crazy.

23:56.600 --> 24:01.800
But we just spent the last couple of days together,
happier than either one of us can remember.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.600
And I know I have been
all over the place.

24:04.700 --> 24:10.300
But my best friend told me,
"pick a team." And you were right.

24:12.100 --> 24:15.600
- You're happy?
- We both are.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.300
That's all that counts.

24:18.500 --> 24:22.100
Besides, the only people that tear happy
people down are those that are unhappy,

24:22.200 --> 24:26.100
so you go do your thing.
I got your back.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.400
Thanks.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.900
Thank you.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.200
For what?

24:35.500 --> 24:37.400
For always helping me,

24:38.300 --> 24:42.600
for giving me a place to live
and for the record label and...

24:43.900 --> 24:46.400
for being my best friend.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.600
You really are a good person,
Brooke Davis.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.500
And what do I get out of it?

24:53.100 --> 24:57.600
Great friends... great life...
good Karma.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.200
I don't believe in Karma.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.100
I try to be a good person,
and bad stuff happens anyway.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.600
Like what kind of bad stuff?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.400
Like falling down the stairs?

25:12.400 --> 25:15.000
Yeah, something like that.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.700
You missing Angie?

25:19.300 --> 25:21.900
I don't really want
to talk about it.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.000
Okay.

25:26.300 --> 25:28.600
Well, let me ask you something.

25:29.200 --> 25:33.900
If you don't believe in Karma...
what do you believe in?

25:35.400 --> 25:37.300
Justice.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.600
Make sure we make it bigger, mama.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.900
- Q's a little bigger than me.
- A little?

25:47.700 --> 25:50.000
You think nanny Deb wants help?

25:50.100 --> 25:53.600
Oh, I think nanny Deb's taking
a nap right now.

25:53.700 --> 25:58.400
- She sure has been tired a lot lately.
- Yeah, she has, huh?

26:00.200 --> 26:02.600
Where did I put my scissors?

26:22.900 --> 26:26.400
- Hey. Masked avenger, get up.
- What?

26:26.500 --> 26:28.800
I know what you've been up to.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.200
I was gonna tell you.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.700
Deb, I will not have a junkie
around my son.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.600
Oh, wait. What?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.900
I found the pills.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.200
Okay.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.900
Come on, Deb. Nathan's pain
medication for his back.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.200
This bottle was full a week ago, and now
you're out all night and you're always tired.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.700
You think I took those pills?

26:50.800 --> 26:54.200
Well, unless you've been fighting crime
in that thing, where the hell have you been?

26:55.600 --> 26:58.000
I've been having sex.

26:58.800 --> 27:03.100
Well, I have. And I haven't
taken a single one of those pills.

27:04.500 --> 27:08.700
I believe your husband's back
has been bothering him lately.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.900
<i>We know what you've been
up to, Nathan.</i>

27:12.000 --> 27:16.100
And don't try and blame it on Deb,
because she has been having sex.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.100
Have you been taking these pills?

27:20.200 --> 27:21.600
- And don't say...
- Yes.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.100
- Yes. Yes?
- Yeah.

27:24.300 --> 27:28.200
Those are my pain pills for my back,
and my back's been in pain.

27:28.300 --> 27:31.200
- This bottle was full a week ago.
- I know.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.200
I've been taking two a day,
which is what the prescription says.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.200
- But..
- You know, contrary to popular belief,

27:36.200 --> 27:40.000
some people can take pills
without turning into a junkie.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.000
I'm going back to bed.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.600
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I could probably play through the pain,

27:52.700 --> 27:54.600
but those pills really seem to help.

27:54.700 --> 27:58.700
- I just want you to be careful.
- I will.

27:59.100 --> 28:04.100
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.500
Can we at least just
go see the doctor

28:07.600 --> 28:11.000
and talk to him about everything
now that you're playing again?

28:11.100 --> 28:14.400
Sure. We'll go tomorrow.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.100
Okay.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.800
You know what the worst part
about being a fugitive is?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.400
Being a fugitive.

28:24.500 --> 28:28.700
All that sneaking around,
constantly being pursued.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.400
See, that's where you come in.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.700
Grandpa Dan, just out of prison,
hanging around the schoolyard,

28:33.800 --> 28:38.900
and then Jamie's missing
and grandpa Dan's missing.

28:39.100 --> 28:44.000
I'm sure the manhunt will be extensive, but
they'll be looking for you in a black S.U.V.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.700
Not in a shallow grave out
by the swing set.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.600
You know what I love most?

28:56.700 --> 29:00.300
The fact that no one checks up
on you because no one likes you.

29:00.400 --> 29:04.300
Yeah, they'll all miss Jamie,
but no one's gonna miss you.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.400
All I have to do is burn
your I.D and that pager.

29:07.500 --> 29:11.600
And, by the way, a beeper.. what are you,
a drug dealer on "Miami Vice?"

29:15.900 --> 29:20.300
You did get one page, though..
right after I hit you with that car.

29:20.700 --> 29:24.400
So I guess your table's ready
at the cheesecake factory.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.600
It's alive!

29:35.500 --> 29:37.400
Well done.

29:38.100 --> 29:41.300
What does it want to say?

29:45.700 --> 29:48.200
Your plan sucks.

29:58.160 --> 30:02.400
You know, that pain you're experiencing
is your body telling you to slow down.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.620
You can't handle the pace you kept
before your accident.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.790
Which is not to say you can't
have a basketball career again,

30:07.790 --> 30:09.270
if you're smart about it.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.950
What does that mean, exactly?

30:11.050 --> 30:13.560
Can you tell us the risks
to him if he plays again?

30:13.560 --> 30:16.130
Well, it's the "exactly" part
that's a little tricky, Haley.

30:16.130 --> 30:19.990
Nathan's back is held together with
medical ingenuity and a few miracles.

30:19.990 --> 30:22.700
The miracle part isn't
exactly scientific.

30:22.700 --> 30:25.530
But it's possible that I could play
for 10 years and be fine, right?

30:25.530 --> 30:26.810
Oh, yeah, it's possible.

30:27.210 --> 30:28.880
But here's the worst-case scenario.

30:28.880 --> 30:32.820
You cause your spine enough trauma
to end up back in that wheelchair..

30:32.820 --> 30:35.470
possibly for life.

30:40.260 --> 30:42.790
How come Peyton's moving out?

30:42.990 --> 30:44.950
Because she's moving in with me.

30:44.950 --> 30:46.090
We're getting married.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.490
What happened to Lindsey?

30:49.780 --> 30:51.350
It's a long story, kid.

30:52.437 --> 30:55.802
Were you ever in love with mama?

30:56.550 --> 30:59.500
What do you mean? Like "love" love?

31:00.450 --> 31:03.520
No, we were always, uh,
just friends.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.130
Why?

31:05.130 --> 31:06.590
Just wondered.

31:06.590 --> 31:09.490
Were you ever in love
with aunt Brooke?

31:11.430 --> 31:13.810
Long story.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.040
Here.

31:16.400 --> 31:20.070
Make yourself useful, knucklehead.

31:20.820 --> 31:25.030
When you get married, do I have
to be the ring bearer again?

31:25.030 --> 31:27.010
Not if you don't want to.

31:27.010 --> 31:31.520
Good. 'Cause last time,
it didn't work out so well.

31:37.150 --> 31:40.130
Your plan sucks.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.200
Really?

31:41.200 --> 31:44.050
The guy can finally speak,
and he's a frickin' talking parrot.

31:44.050 --> 31:46.300
Don't make me get the ball gag.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.060
Now you're just turning me on.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.520
Okay.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.770
I'll play your little game, parrot.

31:54.770 --> 31:58.280
Why does my plan suck?

31:58.280 --> 32:00.700
The pager.

32:00.700 --> 32:03.390
There's a number on the back of it.

32:03.390 --> 32:06.040
Call it.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.660
Is this a trick?

32:12.660 --> 32:16.600
Call it and find out.

32:21.680 --> 32:25.450
My plan doesn't suck.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.510
They're getting married, huh?

32:31.510 --> 32:34.070
Yeah.

32:37.730 --> 32:40.580
The doctor scared you, didn't he?

32:41.050 --> 32:44.290
Right about the time he said "paralysis."

32:49.520 --> 32:53.590
I was watching you practice
with the team yesterday.

32:53.590 --> 32:55.720
You looked so happy.

32:55.720 --> 32:59.670
Somebody that was doing exactly
what they were born to do.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.480
You still love it, don't you?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.500
Yeah.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.410
I do.

33:04.410 --> 33:07.750
And the truth is, I could probably slow down
and try to play a little differently.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.520
No, you can't.
That's not who you are.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.330
You can't do that.

33:12.330 --> 33:14.090
Can I tell you a secret, though?

33:14.090 --> 33:16.280
That's what I love about you.

33:16.280 --> 33:19.370
I remember the first time I saw you
play when I was tutoring you.

33:19.370 --> 33:21.560
You were like a rock star out there.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.200
Masonboro.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.230
You sat with Keith,
and you wore that goofy hat.

33:26.230 --> 33:27.950
Whatever.

33:27.950 --> 33:30.010
I scored 35 points that night,

33:30.010 --> 33:35.380
and each basket was like my own personal
version of a Haley James pickup line.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.760
It worked.

33:39.110 --> 33:42.920
I played that game for you, Haley,
and you know what?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.700
I'd give it up for you, too.

33:45.700 --> 33:51.340
'Cause as much as I love playing the game
and the person that I am when I play it,

33:51.870 --> 33:56.690
I love being a husband
and a father more.

34:02.990 --> 34:05.200
This is the last of it.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.310
- No Brooke?
- No.

34:07.310 --> 34:08.760
She was gone when
I woke up this morning,

34:08.760 --> 34:11.620
and she's not picking up
her cell or at the store.

34:11.620 --> 34:13.370
That sucks. I really
wanted to see her.

34:13.370 --> 34:14.909
A little help here.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.400
I got you.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.570
Hey, Peyton.

34:21.570 --> 34:26.030
It's a beginning, not an end.

35:08.870 --> 35:12.070
Stop smiling!

35:12.330 --> 35:14.130
Call the number.

35:14.130 --> 35:15.030
"Call the number, call the number!"

35:15.030 --> 35:16.040
You want me to call the number?

35:16.040 --> 35:18.450
I'll call the damn number!

35:22.950 --> 35:25.990
Pay as you go. No caller I.D.

35:25.990 --> 35:30.820
My "plan sucks," says
the cripple in the restraints.

35:31.090 --> 35:32.420
<i>Emergency medical response team.</i>

35:32.420 --> 35:36.170
May I have your name and
the number on your pager, please?

35:36.170 --> 35:37.850
I-I'm sorry. I think I've dialed
the wrong number.

35:37.850 --> 35:38.990
Who is this?

35:38.990 --> 35:41.240
<i>Emergency medical response team.</i>

35:41.240 --> 35:43.530
<i>And unless you're on the waiting list
for a heart transplant,</i>

35:43.530 --> 35:45.680
<i>you've called the wrong number.</i>

35:45.680 --> 35:48.070
I'm sorry.

35:49.250 --> 35:50.590
Shut up.

35:50.590 --> 35:54.230
I said, shut up!

36:05.330 --> 36:06.500
Brooke?

36:06.500 --> 36:10.010
It's Deb, honey.

36:10.310 --> 36:12.820
Brooke?

36:26.030 --> 36:27.500
Hi.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.070
I was in the neighborhood.

36:29.070 --> 36:31.860
Thought you might want
to have a little girls' night.

36:31.860 --> 36:34.310
No, thank you.

36:34.310 --> 36:35.820
Brooke...

36:35.820 --> 36:40.080
I lived a lot of years
feeling powerless and alone.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.960
I was pissed off and medicated
and scared to death.

36:42.960 --> 36:48.090
That's not going to happen to you..
not if I can help it.

36:49.010 --> 36:50.940
Now, get dressed.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.480
What does that mean..
emergency response team?

36:53.480 --> 36:56.230
Speak!

36:56.230 --> 36:58.300
It means...

36:58.300 --> 37:01.220
I have less than six
months to live.

37:01.220 --> 37:04.620
And even if I kidnap
my own grandson,

37:04.620 --> 37:09.090
then I'm only a suspect
for a few months.

37:09.090 --> 37:11.040
Then I'm dead.

37:11.040 --> 37:14.670
And where is he?

37:19.770 --> 37:24.660
Which is means.. your plan sucks.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.420
Stop saying that!

37:26.420 --> 37:27.350
You hear me?

37:27.350 --> 37:33.530
Stop saying that, and keep your mouth shut,
or I promise you I will kill you right now!

37:33.530 --> 37:35.970
Without that heart...

37:35.970 --> 37:39.810
I'm already dead.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.490
<i>- Hi, this is Brooke.
- And this is Peyton.</i>

38:09.490 --> 38:10.490
<i>- Leave us..
- Call us..</i>

38:10.490 --> 38:11.700
<i>You said I was supposed
to go next.</i>

38:11.700 --> 38:12.790
<i>- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did!</i>

38:12.790 --> 38:16.610
<i>- Leave a message. Bye.
- I told you I was gonna go next.</i>

38:36.636 --> 38:37.892
Game.

38:38.230 --> 38:39.020
<i>Damn.</i>

38:39.020 --> 38:40.140
One more, man. Let's go.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.410
That's it. I'm done today, man.

38:42.410 --> 38:43.910
What?

38:43.910 --> 38:45.280
That's soft, man.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.900
You ain't never getting
to the association like that.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.260
All right, we'll see about that.

38:50.260 --> 38:51.830
<i>So, you're leaving?</i>

38:51.830 --> 38:54.190
<i>Just like that?</i>

38:54.190 --> 38:56.260
What the hell are you
thinking about, Nate?

38:56.260 --> 39:02.620
I'm thinking I got a really hot wife and
an awesome son waiting for me at home.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.370
<i>Hey, Nate.</i>

39:08.240 --> 39:11.040
I'm happy to be a part of it, man.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.790
What's that?

39:12.790 --> 39:14.230
The comeback.

39:14.230 --> 39:15.970
Don't call it a comeback, man.

39:15.970 --> 39:17.880
Oh, it's a comeback, baby.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.670
It's a beautiful thing to watch, bro.

39:20.670 --> 39:23.400
Tomorrow morning.. Rivercourt.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.570
And, Q...

39:26.770 --> 39:30.470
Thank you.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.050
It's so awesome, mama.

39:42.050 --> 39:44.560
Quentin's gonna love it.

39:49.940 --> 39:53.040
Don't you have the apartment
all to yourself now?

39:53.040 --> 39:54.290
Where's the party?

39:54.290 --> 39:57.530
Yeah, well, you got a whole
house all to yourself.

39:57.530 --> 40:00.250
Not anymore.

40:00.250 --> 40:03.610
Peyton's moving in.
We're getting married.

40:03.910 --> 40:05.590
Well, well.

40:05.590 --> 40:09.870
You want another drink, or should
I just wait till you propose to Brooke?

40:09.870 --> 40:10.720
Nice.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.820
How about I buy you a drink, huh?

40:12.820 --> 40:14.750
I mean, unless it's a bad time.

40:14.750 --> 40:15.480
Nah.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.600
I was just gonna talk
to Q about something.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.850
But I'll see him tomorrow.

40:18.850 --> 40:19.910
All right. Let's go.

40:19.910 --> 40:22.720
Let's roll.

40:41.260 --> 40:45.340
Can I get 20 on pump number 1, please?

Oh, my god.

41:37.150 --> 41:39.970
Lucas, what is it?

41:46.530 --> 41:50.150
Quentin Fields was shot tonight.

41:50.150 --> 41:51.230
He's dead.
