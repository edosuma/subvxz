WEBVTT

05:34.543 --> 05:36.503
Where is this?

05:39.048 --> 05:40.799
Where are we?

19:15.446 --> 19:16.739
Mm.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.248
Dougie, what is wrong
with your arm?

19:25.373 --> 19:26.249
I don't know.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.208
Huh.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.294
I think it fell asleep.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.378
It's sort of tingly.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.423
I'm kind of tingly too.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.051
I'ma go wash up, okay?

19:37.177 --> 19:38.136
Mm.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.731
Mm.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.242
Oh! Oh.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.143
What the fuck was that?

21:51.227 --> 21:52.645
Dougie!

22:53.873 --> 22:56.793
I feel...funny.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.719
What's happening to me?

23:18.564 --> 23:20.024
What?

23:36.082 --> 23:38.459
It has?

23:59.522 --> 24:01.566
That's weird.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.005
What was that noise, Dougie?

26:30.298 --> 26:31.674
Where are you?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.009
Dougie?

26:35.136 --> 26:35.970
Oh, my God.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.848
Dougie, what the hell?

26:38.973 --> 26:42.101
Where'd you get that suit...

26:42.226 --> 26:43.853
and haircut?

26:46.022 --> 26:49.609
Have you been wearing a rug
all this time, Dougie?

26:53.904 --> 26:55.239
Mm.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.783
Oh, my God,
are you sick, Dougie?

26:57.908 --> 27:00.494
Come on, we got to get
out of this house.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.541
Come on, Dougie!

27:28.064 --> 27:29.148
Dougie.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.984
Dougie, did you
forget something?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.361
Your shoes?

27:38.324 --> 27:40.159
I'll get them.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.850
Dougie!

28:07.228 --> 28:09.230
Could you quit fucking around?

28:09.355 --> 28:11.857
And put on your shoes. Here.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.988
Put on your damn shoes!

28:24.537 --> 28:25.538
Come on, let's go.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.010
All right...

28:41.303 --> 28:42.847
You do have your keys, right?

29:07.455 --> 29:11.417
You mean Jade
has to give you two rides?

29:42.364 --> 29:44.992
Yeah, she just drove by
in a Wrangler.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.203
Looked like
maybe two people, but...

29:47.328 --> 29:48.829
his car's still here.

29:50.581 --> 29:52.625
I'm all set near the entrance.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.379
If he's in the car, I'll get him here.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.591
Once you find your wallet

30:00.716 --> 30:02.301
or your cell phone,

30:02.426 --> 30:05.012
a pay phone or some money,

30:05.137 --> 30:06.847
you can call AAA, Dougie.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.641
They will help you.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.156
Jade give two rides.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.702
Oh, my God.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.253
Gene...

31:19.378 --> 31:20.921
he's not in the car.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.632
Yeah, he must still be inside.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.384
I'll load up his car.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.969
All right.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.013
I'll see you at Mikey's.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.655
One-one-nine!

31:46.780 --> 31:48.866
One-one-nine!

31:51.201 --> 31:52.578
One-one-nine!

32:10.304 --> 32:12.264
One-one-nine!

34:01.957 --> 34:03.292
What the hell, Billy?

34:03.417 --> 34:05.210
Oh, God,
something awful's in there.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.005
Dispatch.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.590
We need an ambulance.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.091
And tell them
to bring gas masks.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.386
There is something bad
in this vehicle.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.347
Come here.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.937
You'll be all right.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.225
We laid
everything out, Hawk,

35:01.350 --> 35:05.020
and we can't find
anything that's missing.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.110
If it's not here, then...

35:11.235 --> 35:13.278
how do you know
it's missing?

35:27.417 --> 35:29.628
But if it is here...

35:29.753 --> 35:32.881
then it isn't missing?

35:38.137 --> 35:40.764
This...

35:40.889 --> 35:42.891
is here.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.772
Let's sit down.

35:53.026 --> 35:53.986
Let‒

35:54.111 --> 35:56.405
let me sit down.

35:56.530 --> 35:59.116
Let's start
from the beginning.

35:59.241 --> 36:01.827
- And‒
- Don't say a thing.

36:03.704 --> 36:05.998
I need to think out loud.

36:07.457 --> 36:11.503
Something is missing,
and I need to find it.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.089
And the way I'm gonna find it

36:14.214 --> 36:17.301
has something to do
with my heritage.

36:23.807 --> 36:26.351
You're an Indian.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.068
Yes, Lucy.

36:36.486 --> 36:38.405
And apparently...

36:38.530 --> 36:41.742
that's the way I'm gonna find
what's missing.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.509
- Aah!
- What is it?

36:59.635 --> 37:01.678
- Aah!
- Are you okay, punky?

37:01.803 --> 37:04.223
I know what's missing!

37:04.348 --> 37:06.141
What's missing?

37:06.266 --> 37:08.101
The bunny!

37:08.227 --> 37:10.062
The bunny.

37:10.187 --> 37:12.606
I ate that bunny!

37:15.150 --> 37:16.276
That's missing.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.904
That's missing.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.490
Do chocolate bunnies

37:21.615 --> 37:24.076
have anything to do
with your heritage?

37:30.123 --> 37:31.041
No.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.126
It's not about the bunny.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.799
You ate the evidence, Lucy?

37:38.924 --> 37:40.842
I know!

37:40.968 --> 37:43.595
I never did it again.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.389
And I only ate one.

37:45.514 --> 37:48.183
And I never did it again.

37:48.308 --> 37:52.145
But I had a problem
at that time with‒

37:52.271 --> 37:56.358
And I don't like to
say this in front of Andy.

37:58.777 --> 38:02.447
But I had a bubble...

38:02.572 --> 38:05.075
of gas.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.077
And I had read...

38:07.202 --> 38:09.496
...that sometimes chocolate,

38:09.621 --> 38:11.873
which I love,

38:11.999 --> 38:14.876
can be used as a remedy,

38:15.002 --> 38:17.462
maybe by indigenous people.

38:17.587 --> 38:19.715
Is that true, Hawk?

38:19.840 --> 38:23.302
Do you use chocolate
as a remedy for gas?

38:24.970 --> 38:28.515
Do you want
another bunny, punky?

38:28.640 --> 38:30.183
I can get you more bunnies.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.812
It's not about the bunny.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.998
Is it about the bunny?

39:01.673 --> 39:02.674
No.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.844
It's not about the bunny.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.165
All right.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.416
Go inside, Dougie.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.293
Someone will help you in there.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.631
- In there.
- Right.

41:47.756 --> 41:50.675
And I think you should try
to forget you ever met me.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.385
Shouldn't be too hard for you.

41:52.511 --> 41:53.929
Now, here's five dollars.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.014
Call for help.

41:57.807 --> 41:59.184
Call for help.

41:59.309 --> 42:00.977
Right.

42:01.102 --> 42:03.230
And I think you should maybe
call a doctor or something

42:03.355 --> 42:06.024
because I think you might've had
a little stroke or something.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.152
Something.

42:10.862 --> 42:11.988
Yes.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.657
You can go out now.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.627
Dougie, go.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.464
Come on, let's get you out of here.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.512
Come on.
Let's go, Dougie.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.140
Right, right.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.049
Call for help.

43:55.842 --> 43:57.510
In the back, Jack.

44:05.852 --> 44:07.479
Hey!

44:09.564 --> 44:11.816
You're gonna need
some change.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.488
Some change.

44:36.341 --> 44:37.884
Some change.

44:39.052 --> 44:42.764
Well, how do you want it?
You gonna play a game?

44:42.889 --> 44:44.432
Game.

44:46.518 --> 44:48.395
What game are you gonna play?

44:51.398 --> 44:53.024
Call for help.

46:07.390 --> 46:08.600
Hello!

47:24.175 --> 47:25.176
Hello.

47:32.267 --> 47:34.561
Ah, you broke that one.

47:34.686 --> 47:36.354
You broke it real good.

47:37.689 --> 47:39.649
Broke it.

47:39.774 --> 47:41.359
Sure did, pal.

48:23.568 --> 48:26.237
Hello!

48:44.881 --> 48:46.758
<i>Mega, mega jackpot.</i>

48:46.883 --> 48:48.176
Congratulations, sir.

48:48.301 --> 48:50.094
You are a mega winner.

48:50.219 --> 48:52.347
You've just won
two mega jackpots

48:52.472 --> 48:55.808
for a total of $28,400.

48:55.934 --> 48:58.269
It's much more
than these quarters.

49:00.063 --> 49:01.397
Call for help.

49:01.522 --> 49:02.857
Oh, well, that's what I'm here for.

49:02.982 --> 49:04.817
Let me get you a bigger bucket.

49:29.592 --> 49:31.094
No.

50:20.852 --> 50:23.479
The nutcake left.

50:23.604 --> 50:25.314
Joe, you watch this one.

50:38.161 --> 50:40.955
Hello!

51:15.740 --> 51:17.909
Oh! Oh! Oh!

51:31.422 --> 51:33.591
Albert?

51:33.716 --> 51:35.426
He's been officially accused now

51:35.551 --> 51:37.637
of brutally murdering his wife.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.348
He claims he's innocent
and knows who did it

51:40.473 --> 51:43.059
but can't say because it would
breach national security.

51:43.184 --> 51:44.685
However...

51:44.811 --> 51:47.897
he got word to Chris here
that these items,

51:48.022 --> 51:50.608
which he placed
in his garden in Georgetown,

51:50.733 --> 51:53.653
are the clues to the identity
of the killer.

52:29.856 --> 52:33.526
The congressman's dilemma.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.529
All right, you all can
go get to work on this.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.573
And, Tammy, you stay

52:38.698 --> 52:41.325
and show me and Albert
what you found in New York.

52:43.369 --> 52:44.245
Thank you all.

52:44.370 --> 52:46.497
- You're welcome.
- Welcome.

53:05.725 --> 53:09.103
NYPD doesn't have a clue
what was going on here.

53:09.228 --> 53:12.481
They don't even know
who owns the place.

53:12.607 --> 53:15.109
Apparently there were guards
on duty 24-7,

53:15.234 --> 53:17.904
but they can't find any of them.

53:18.029 --> 53:21.616
Only the victims‒
Sam Colby, Tracey Barberato‒

53:21.741 --> 53:23.576
have been ID'd.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.661
They confiscated
hundreds of digital files

53:25.786 --> 53:28.497
showing various angles
of this glass box.

53:30.041 --> 53:34.253
Once in a while, they show
some blurred shape pass through,

53:34.378 --> 53:35.963
but only a few frames.

53:36.088 --> 53:38.299
Then on the night
of the murders,

53:38.424 --> 53:40.676
on camera, this appears.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.849
What the hell?

53:48.601 --> 53:50.269
The other cameras saw nothing.

53:50.394 --> 53:53.773
And as soon
as this thing moved,

53:53.898 --> 53:55.650
it disappeared.

53:57.401 --> 53:58.486
Forensics?

53:58.611 --> 54:00.404
The bodies were
violently mutilated,

54:00.529 --> 54:03.282
but no prints,
no DNA, no fibers.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.951
Completely clean.

54:05.076 --> 54:06.619
Nothing.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.996
<i>Director Cole?</i>

54:09.121 --> 54:11.040
<i>On your phone, it's Cooper.</i>

54:11.165 --> 54:12.541
What?

54:12.667 --> 54:15.503
<i>On your phone, it's Cooper.</i>

54:17.171 --> 54:18.339
Albert.

54:30.059 --> 54:32.061
This is Cole.

54:32.186 --> 54:34.313
Yes, I'll hold.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.773
- Is it him?
- What?

54:35.898 --> 54:37.066
Is it him?

54:37.191 --> 54:38.567
Yes, I hear you.

54:39.819 --> 54:41.153
What?

54:41.279 --> 54:44.365
Where?

54:44.490 --> 54:45.700
Are you sure it's him?

54:48.286 --> 54:50.288
What do you mean "trouble"?

54:52.164 --> 54:55.084
All right, we'll be out there
first thing tomorrow morning.

54:55.209 --> 54:57.795
Set up an interview
for nine o'clock sharp.

55:00.673 --> 55:01.882
Albert, we're headed

55:02.008 --> 55:04.719
for the Black Hills
of South Dakota.

55:04.844 --> 55:05.886
The Black Hills?

55:06.012 --> 55:07.763
Seriously?

55:07.888 --> 55:10.016
As happy as this news
makes us, Albert,

55:10.141 --> 55:12.143
we can't put this
on the radio.

55:12.268 --> 55:13.686
Perfect.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.813
I've been dying to see
Mount Rushmore.

55:15.938 --> 55:17.606
It's good you want to hurry.

55:17.732 --> 55:19.025
We fly at dawn,

55:19.150 --> 55:21.235
and, Tammy,
you're coming with us.

55:27.450 --> 55:32.079
The absurd mystery
of the strange forces of existence.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.709
