02:27.833 --> 02:29.833
Oh, my God.

02:29.833 --> 02:31.666
Did you see that?

02:58.208 --> 03:00.791
Your ass should be in school.

03:00.833 --> 03:04.083
lt’s Saturday, dear Gypsy.
Come out and play.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.375
When are you gonna
learn to drive...

03:06.375 --> 03:08.333
like a normal 18-year-old?

03:08.375 --> 03:10.625
Soon as you let me
practice in the Trans.

03:12.041 --> 03:14.166
ln your dreams.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.666
Hello.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.750
Hello, sunshine.

03:21.958 --> 03:23.958
lt’s been, like,
ten whole hours.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.708
l know.

03:25.791 --> 03:26.916
Oh, shit!

03:26.958 --> 03:28.541
My sister.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.291
Stay down.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.541
Sorry.

03:35.958 --> 03:39.333
Gypsy Vale, that three-for-one
Thursdays idea of yours...

03:39.333 --> 03:40.750
is going apeshit.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.833
Top sales in north-central Ohio.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.291
Cool.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.500
Dinner for two,
compliments of Polly Pearl.

03:50.833 --> 03:54.458
Chili’s. l love Chili’s.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.666
Try the low-cal potato poppers.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.166
Keep it up, G-force.

04:05.083 --> 04:07.583
You little shit.

04:07.625 --> 04:10.541
l need to keep this job.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.000
Hello.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.625
Hi. lt’s Taylor, Connie.

04:20.625 --> 04:21.833
Yeah.

04:27.125 --> 04:30.291
Didn’t you go
to Sandusky High?

04:30.333 --> 04:32.291
Yeah. lt’s gonna be
$9.48, please.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.416
Gypsy something, right?

04:35.833 --> 04:38.916
Vale. Gypsy Vale.

04:40.166 --> 04:45.083
l see you’re still
into Stevie Nicks.

04:45.125 --> 04:46.250
Jammin’.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.666
Hello, Connie.

04:48.708 --> 04:53.958
Weren’t you going to be
some big rock star or something?

04:54.000 --> 04:58.416
Yeah. You sang at talent night.
What was that?

04:58.416 --> 05:02.541
Third grade? Oh, my God.
How hilarious.

05:02.583 --> 05:07.500
So, like...what happened?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.250
That sure is
some good eating, little lady.

05:17.666 --> 05:20.125
Thank you
for shopping at Foto-Hut.

05:23.416 --> 05:27.125
Who is she now?
Some loser housewife?

05:27.166 --> 05:29.875
You’re the one
who’s gonna be famous.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.625
Hi, Carl.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.500
Hey, dad.

05:59.541 --> 06:02.958
Hey, mom. Hey, Charlie.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.875
Give me the camera.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.583
OK...Clive.

06:56.833 --> 07:02.166
l come out with my back
to the audience.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.708
Total mystery and drama.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.125
With the fog machine?

07:05.166 --> 07:07.708
Smoke, Stevie wind,
the whole damn nine.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.333
And l take off my cape.

07:13.375 --> 07:17.041
And three white-winged doves
fly out.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.250
And then, at the height
of the guitar solo...

07:22.291 --> 07:24.750
l come center stage.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.708
And l fuckin’ twirl.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.000
Stop. You’re giving me wood.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.625
Go, baby! Go!

07:39.583 --> 07:42.375
l want the world
to hear my voice, you know.

07:42.416 --> 07:45.958
l want them to write my lyrics
on their AOL profiles...

07:46.000 --> 07:48.500
just like they do Stevie.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.625
And when my CD comes out...

07:50.666 --> 07:55.750
l want all these assholes to
line up at the fucking mall...

07:55.791 --> 07:59.541
and kiss my ass
one sound-scan at a time.

07:59.625 --> 08:00.750
Excuse me.

08:00.791 --> 08:02.791
May l ask you a question?

08:02.833 --> 08:06.750
Do you think it’s appropriate
to dance in a graveyard?

08:06.791 --> 08:09.750
Don’t you think that we should
dance while we can?

08:09.791 --> 08:13.750
l think you should have
more respect for the dead...

08:13.791 --> 08:17.000
and especially for yourself.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.083
Excuse me?

08:19.125 --> 08:21.416
l didn’t want to mention this...

08:21.458 --> 08:23.708
but you could be
a very pretty girl...

08:23.750 --> 08:27.875
but that would be inappropriate
for any young lady...

08:27.916 --> 08:30.666
especially for someone
your size.

08:30.708 --> 08:34.625
Look, Granny,
l am a pretty girl, OK?

08:34.666 --> 08:36.082
Big is beautiful.
Haven’t you heard?

08:36.166 --> 08:37.875
And for the record,
l don’t give...

08:37.875 --> 08:40.166
a flying fuck
or a rolling rimjob...

08:40.207 --> 08:44.166
what you or anyone else
thinks of me.

08:44.207 --> 08:45.708
You’re dismissed.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.250
Hey, G.

09:06.666 --> 09:10.625
Hey, daddy. lt’s gonna have to
be the Colonel tonight.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.666
OK.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.500
Nails.

09:19.541 --> 09:20.750
Cheers.

09:20.791 --> 09:22.416
How was work?

09:24.083 --> 09:27.833
Fucking fabulous. And you?

09:27.916 --> 09:29.791
lt was pretty good.

09:29.791 --> 09:33.250
l signed up a new kid
for lessons today.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.500
That’s awesome.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.625
What’s this?

09:50.666 --> 09:52.666
Something to write
your lyrics in.

09:52.708 --> 09:55.125
l love it. Thank you.

09:57.125 --> 10:01.458
Why don’t we do one
of your old Luna Angel tunes?

10:01.500 --> 10:03.916
’’Crystal Sea?’’

10:05.791 --> 10:07.458
OK.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.875
l fell into a crystal sea

10:21.750 --> 10:28.333
lnside a ship of fools
like...me

10:28.375 --> 10:30.875
Was it just a dream?

10:30.916 --> 10:34.750
Was l floating ’round
in circles?

10:34.750 --> 10:37.791
Oh, your face, your face

10:37.833 --> 10:39.958
ls all l see

10:42.166 --> 10:46.791
l’ll be waiting here, my love

10:49.416 --> 10:53.500
Forever and a year, my love

10:56.375 --> 11:01.000
Waiting here for you, my love

11:13.541 --> 11:15.958
Forget your trench coat,
girlie boy?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.916
Piss off!

12:23.791 --> 12:25.625
Hey.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.333
Hey, Lois.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.708
Nice outfit.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.000
Thank you. l like it.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.750
My brother,
he’s in the basement.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.666
Gypsy?

12:36.708 --> 12:40.458
This whole...gay thing.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.000
He thinks we can’t deal,
but cripe...

12:43.041 --> 12:45.458
l had a gay friend
in college.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.750
We used to be so close.

12:49.791 --> 12:54.500
ls he using...safe sex?

13:00.833 --> 13:02.458
He’s a virgin.

13:02.500 --> 13:06.416
Good. l just worry.

13:10.333 --> 13:14.375
Look after him for me, OK?

13:14.416 --> 13:16.166
l do.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.666
Thanks.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.291
Check it out.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.375
Come here.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.500
Clive.

13:38.541 --> 13:40.125
Cool, G.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.500
Did you finish my new shawl?

13:46.541 --> 13:48.958
Not yet.

13:51.666 --> 13:54.750
Could you please just ditch
the fucking term paper...

13:54.791 --> 13:56.583
and fix my face?

13:58.333 --> 14:01.583
How could l improve
on perfection?

14:01.625 --> 14:04.000
All right, Mr. Straight-A...

14:04.000 --> 14:07.458
l’m not getting nearly enough
hard-core fagma this afternoon.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.875
l’m sorry.

14:09.916 --> 14:13.125
l’m just kind of down today.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.416
l’ll help you get it up.

14:16.916 --> 14:20.625
l’m kidding.
What’s your paper on?

14:20.666 --> 14:23.958
’’Stevie Nicks,
unlikely godmother of goth.’’

14:25.166 --> 14:26.458
Sterling.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.000
Did you check
on the Nicks-Pix?

14:29.041 --> 14:31.416
They just posted
some delicious new photos.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.041
Oh, my God.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.750
What?

14:46.791 --> 14:48.666
The goth nightclub Mother
announces...

14:48.708 --> 14:51.458
their fifth annual
’’Night of a Thousand Stevies...’’

14:51.500 --> 14:54.750
to be held on Tuesday,
May fifteenth, in New York City.

14:54.791 --> 14:57.000
A strict Stevie dress code
will be enforced.

14:57.041 --> 14:58.666
Suggested attire is...

14:58.708 --> 15:01.000
’’Like a White-Winged Dove’’
Stevie realness...

15:01.041 --> 15:03.083
all periods,
including ’’Rhiannon’’ capes...

15:03.125 --> 15:06.000
metallic shawls, baby’s breath,
platform boots...

15:06.041 --> 15:09.083
leather and lace, tophats,
beribboned tambourines...

15:09.125 --> 15:12.000
and the best hair
in rock-and-roll.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.500
Performers are to be selected
at an audition screening...

15:14.541 --> 15:16.208
before the show
and compete for awards...

15:16.250 --> 15:18.541
selected by a judging committee
of Stevie experts.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.416
Oh, my God. Let me see.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.541
What?

15:28.625 --> 15:30.625
Nothing.

15:30.666 --> 15:32.458
lt’s just...lt’s cool.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.000
Oh, my God.
This is in four days.

15:37.041 --> 15:38.291
We have to go to this.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.125
You have to perform.

16:58.500 --> 17:02.125
Earth to Gypsy.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.708
Do you regret not taking
Luna Angel to New York or L.A.?

17:06.750 --> 17:09.290
You know, building
on the Cleveland triumph...

17:09.333 --> 17:11.000
really going for it?

17:11.040 --> 17:13.833
Where did that come from?

17:13.875 --> 17:16.290
l’d like a real answer, dad.
No bullshit.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.665
Not anymore.

17:24.625 --> 17:27.915
You think l have
what it takes...

17:27.958 --> 17:31.958
to make it big or whatever?

17:32.000 --> 17:35.333
As a totally objective party...

17:35.375 --> 17:38.791
l think you are a superstar.

17:42.958 --> 17:46.125
What if l told you
that l know where Velvet is?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.291
Look.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.041
These were taken
several years back...

17:51.125 --> 17:55.125
at a club in New York City,
and l’m thinking about going...

17:55.125 --> 17:57.791
performing.

17:57.833 --> 18:00.875
And maybe she’s still there.

18:00.958 --> 18:03.500
We agreed
that your mother is dead.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.958
l know, but maybe
she had a reason.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.916
Maybe she could explain.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.375
You know the reason, baby.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.500
l know.

18:22.791 --> 18:25.458
You don’t ever wish
you went with her?

18:29.958 --> 18:33.500
Everything l need
to make me happy...

18:33.541 --> 18:35.583
is right here in this room.

18:48.541 --> 18:50.916
This is the life.

18:53.041 --> 18:56.208
Last night, l dreamt
we were in New York City.

18:57.666 --> 19:00.583
We decided to stay.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.250
That’s a good idea.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.291
Then you could completely
drop out of school...

19:08.333 --> 19:11.208
and trash your 4.0.
That’s smart.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.375
Yeah.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.416
Fuck it.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.750
l don’t...

19:21.000 --> 19:22.416
l can’t go.

19:22.416 --> 19:25.083
lt’s just shitty timing,
you know.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.166
Maybe next year we could go.
We could plan more.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.291
No, we could be dead
next year.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.541
l’m sorry, sweet child.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.666
You’ve been talking about
getting out of Sandusky...

19:37.750 --> 19:38.875
since l met you.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.458
Yeah. Well,
Sandusky’s not that bad.

19:43.041 --> 19:45.166
My dad’s here.

19:45.208 --> 19:48.125
OK. Look me in the eye...

19:48.125 --> 19:50.333
and tell me that you’re
happy in Ohio.

19:53.791 --> 19:56.166
l’m happy in Ohio.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.833
Did you just have an aneurysm?

19:58.875 --> 20:00.791
Sometimes life is a tradeoff.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.541
You’re eighteen,
and you don’t get it.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.208
Get off the gown.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.833
You’re twenty-five,
and you’re gonna be here...

20:06.875 --> 20:09.625
until they bury your ass.
Admit it.

20:11.375 --> 20:12.875
What about our dreams?

20:20.250 --> 20:21.791
My mom is alive.

20:22.916 --> 20:24.833
She bailed on us.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.958
Bye-bye.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.583
When?

20:32.708 --> 20:35.416
1983...

20:35.458 --> 20:37.625
April thirteenth.

20:39.250 --> 20:43.166
She moved to New York to be
a big-time rock star.

20:43.208 --> 20:46.458
Ended up tending bar...
at Mother.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.541
And you don’t want to see her?

20:48.583 --> 20:51.083
No. l don’t really
give a shit about her.

20:51.125 --> 20:54.125
She’s your mom.

20:54.166 --> 20:58.166
Don’t you fucking
lecture me, kiddo.

20:58.208 --> 21:01.750
She’s been dead to me
since before you were born.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.291
l’m sorry.

21:05.791 --> 21:07.750
l bet you are.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.208
Did you say good-bye?

22:24.250 --> 22:25.541
You?

22:25.583 --> 22:29.000
No. We’re runaways!

22:29.041 --> 22:31.083
Farewell, Sandusky!

23:03.000 --> 23:05.833
l don’t think
l ever want to have sex.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.875
- l’m serious.
- OK.

23:10.875 --> 23:13.333
l just want someone to kiss...

23:13.375 --> 23:17.250
with big, soft, delicious lips.

23:17.291 --> 23:20.750
He’d have to smother me
in old-school romance.

23:20.791 --> 23:25.791
l mean, candles and incense...

23:25.833 --> 23:29.750
Moet and Chandon...

23:29.791 --> 23:35.500
but only in a deserted castle
in the south of France.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.333
Oh, my God. You are so much more
of a girl than l am.

23:43.666 --> 23:47.333
Sex just seems so...messy.

23:47.375 --> 23:51.166
Oh, no, no.
Sex can be awesome.

23:51.208 --> 23:53.833
Not that l would
remember, but...

23:58.333 --> 24:00.500
Maybe you and l should try.

24:03.208 --> 24:08.916
l think l’m past my wayward-sex
fag-hag test-fuck phase...

24:08.958 --> 24:11.708
but thank you for the offer.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.500
lt’s just ’’been there,
done that.’’

24:15.875 --> 24:17.708
At least l’d know for sure.

24:17.708 --> 24:21.458
Honey, you’re a queer,
with a capital ’’Q.’’

24:21.541 --> 24:23.125
OK, you know what?
Some of us...

24:23.166 --> 24:25.791
don’t care to be defined
by our sexuality.

24:26.791 --> 24:29.625
OK. Sorry.

24:33.458 --> 24:34.791
Can l ask you a question?

24:34.833 --> 24:35.958
What?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.208
Are you gay?

24:38.250 --> 24:42.208
Yes! But l don’t have anything
in common with those people.

24:42.250 --> 24:45.791
l mean, like l give a rat’s ass
about Judy Garland...

24:45.833 --> 24:48.250
or...Stonewall.

24:48.333 --> 24:50.875
Being queer is
a very small part of me.

24:50.916 --> 24:52.875
Yeah, whatever.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.041
Wow.

25:44.750 --> 25:48.875
So much beauty...
all in one place.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.208
Please give
a warm welcome...

25:55.208 --> 25:57.166
to international
recording artist...

25:57.208 --> 26:00.250
and karaoke hostess
extraordinaire...

26:00.291 --> 26:02.958
Miss Bambi LeBleau.

26:04.791 --> 26:08.041
We love you, Bambi!

26:08.083 --> 26:10.333
Maestro.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.291
Yeah, girl!

26:17.416 --> 26:21.250
When Sunny gets blue

26:21.291 --> 26:26.000
Her eyes get dry and cloudy

26:26.000 --> 26:31.875
Then the rain begins to fall

26:34.041 --> 26:38.458
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter

26:38.458 --> 26:42.458
Love is gone, what can matter

26:42.500 --> 26:49.333
When no lover comes to call?

26:49.375 --> 26:52.791
When Sunny gets blue

26:52.833 --> 26:57.250
She breathes a sigh
of sadness

26:57.291 --> 27:04.750
Like the wind
that stirs the trees

27:04.791 --> 27:09.666
Wind that sets leaves a-swaying

27:09.708 --> 27:12.791
Like some violins are playing

27:12.833 --> 27:20.375
Weird and lonesome melodies

27:20.416 --> 27:24.333
People used to love

27:24.375 --> 27:29.750
To see her smile and laugh

27:29.791 --> 27:35.458
That’s how she got her name

27:35.500 --> 27:39.083
Since that sad affair

27:39.125 --> 27:44.000
She lost her smile
and changed her style

27:44.041 --> 27:48.333
Somehow she’s not the same

27:50.291 --> 27:55.000
But memories will fade

27:55.041 --> 27:59.500
Pretty dreams will rise up

27:59.541 --> 28:06.791
Where the other dreams
fell through

28:06.833 --> 28:11.041
Hurry, new love, hurry here

28:11.041 --> 28:14.125
Kiss away each lonely tear

28:14.208 --> 28:20.625
And hold her near when Sunny

28:20.625 --> 28:31.041
Gets blue

28:35.666 --> 28:37.750
Thank you so much.

28:37.833 --> 28:39.333
She’s a genius.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.625
l think l’m in love with her.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.708
How are you feeling tonight?

28:42.708 --> 28:45.125
My name is Bambi LeBleau...

28:45.166 --> 28:47.375
and l’m delighted
to be your hostess...

28:47.375 --> 28:49.875
for an evening
of karaoke in Maryland.

28:49.916 --> 28:52.083
But if you’re feeling
kind of shy tonight...

28:52.125 --> 28:57.583
by all means...
have another cocktail.

28:57.625 --> 29:00.875
And our first request is...

29:00.875 --> 29:03.375
Sigma Alpha Sigma.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.833
Hello. My name is Troy.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.000
We’re passing through
from Ohio State University.

29:13.041 --> 29:15.625
We’re training this year’s
banner crop of pledges...

29:15.708 --> 29:19.750
who will now entertain
you fine folks with a song.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.666
Enter, bitches.

29:33.166 --> 29:35.416
l’m too sexy for my shirt

29:35.458 --> 29:37.458
Too sexy for my shirt

29:37.500 --> 29:40.708
Too sexy it hurts

29:40.750 --> 29:43.291
l’m too sexy for Milan

29:46.500 --> 29:50.916
What some people will do
to belong.

29:50.958 --> 29:53.958
Troy’s a little fox,
though, huh?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.625
They’re not my type.

29:55.666 --> 29:57.708
Ten to one, he’s horse-hung.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.958
Did you check out his thumbs?
A dead giveaway.

29:59.958 --> 30:02.541
Like l would care.

30:02.583 --> 30:07.041
l think my dear boy
doth protest too much.

30:07.125 --> 30:11.041
OK, Miss Rock Star,
fill one of those out...

30:11.083 --> 30:13.000
and get your freak ass
up there.

30:13.041 --> 30:14.458
ln this dump? Please.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.125
Do you actually care
what these people think?

30:17.166 --> 30:18.708
That’s a first.

30:18.708 --> 30:21.458
Just consider it a dress
rehearsal for New York.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.291
Left, left, right, left...

30:39.000 --> 30:43.041
Bye, guys.
Next time, bring your togas.

30:43.083 --> 30:47.208
l have to admit to you-all
that l am out of requests.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.833
So l need a volunteer.

30:49.875 --> 30:51.041
Her!

30:52.500 --> 30:53.666
- Yes.
- No.

30:53.708 --> 30:55.250
What are you worried about?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.041
Come on. Do l have to
come on down there...

30:59.041 --> 31:01.458
and drag you up here?
Come on.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.916
Come on.
What are you worried about?

31:03.958 --> 31:06.375
Someone’s gonna show you up
or something?

31:09.708 --> 31:11.250
That’s right.
Helps you compete, doesn’t it?

31:11.291 --> 31:13.416
- l’ll be back.
- There we go.

31:13.583 --> 31:18.833
Please give a warm welcome
to Gypsy 83.

31:32.500 --> 31:37.375
l can see we’re thinking
about the same thing and

31:37.416 --> 31:42.166
And l see your expression
when the phone rings

31:42.166 --> 31:43.500
And we both know

31:43.541 --> 31:48.000
There’s something
happening here

31:51.333 --> 31:55.583
There’s no sense in dancing
’round the subject

31:55.666 --> 31:58.416
Come on. Come on.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.833
...When it’s treated
with neglect

31:59.875 --> 32:02.125
So don’t turn now

32:02.166 --> 32:07.500
There’s nothing here
for you to fear

32:07.541 --> 32:10.916
You can talk to me

32:12.291 --> 32:15.541
You can talk to me

32:16.958 --> 32:20.916
You can talk to me

32:22.458 --> 32:26.125
You can set your secrets
free, baby

32:27.375 --> 32:32.708
Dusty words lying under carpets

32:32.750 --> 32:37.041
Seldom heard, honey,
must you keep your secrets

32:37.083 --> 32:39.750
All locked inside

32:39.791 --> 32:45.375
Hidden safe from view, oh-oh?

32:45.416 --> 32:48.458
And was it all that hard?

32:48.500 --> 32:51.041
ls it all that tough?

32:51.083 --> 32:53.000
l showed you all my cards now

32:53.041 --> 32:55.125
lsn’t that enough?

32:55.166 --> 32:57.916
Oh, you can hide your hurt

32:57.958 --> 33:02.541
But there’s something
you can’t do

33:02.583 --> 33:06.125
You can talk to me

33:08.208 --> 33:11.750
You can talk to me

33:13.000 --> 33:15.250
You can talk to me

33:18.125 --> 33:22.541
You can set
your secrets free, baby

33:30.250 --> 33:32.708
That moron.

33:41.375 --> 33:44.125
A big hand for Gypsy 83.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.916
You’re a star
in my book, baby.

33:46.916 --> 33:48.958
l didn’t know
it was Halloween.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.666
You hurt? You rocked.
Fuck them. Just fuck them.

33:51.708 --> 33:53.833
Hey, you--fat chick and the fag.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.583
This one’s for you.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.083
How does this happen?

34:03.958 --> 34:05.833
l’d like to dedicate this one...

34:05.875 --> 34:08.791
to the redneck, beer-gut
pig-fucker up on stage.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.875
Yeah, you, bitch.

34:10.875 --> 34:14.583
Why don’t you come down here
and suck my fucking cock?

34:22.291 --> 34:24.416
lnbred motherfuckers!

34:29.666 --> 34:33.208
How about coming up to my pad
for a nightcap?

34:33.291 --> 34:34.833
l could probably use one.

34:38.125 --> 34:40.333
Wow.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.500
Cocktails?

34:45.500 --> 34:48.625
l do a wicked Bloody Mary.

34:48.708 --> 34:52.125
The bloodier, the better,
right, baby?

34:56.666 --> 34:59.708
- Lebleau.
- OK.

34:59.750 --> 35:02.291
Oh, my God.

35:02.375 --> 35:03.875
This is amazing.

35:05.541 --> 35:08.333
Let me apologize
about tonight.

35:08.375 --> 35:10.666
For some reason,
this karaoke thing...

35:10.708 --> 35:13.250
seems to attract the lowbrows.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.666
You can say that again.

35:15.666 --> 35:19.583
Believe it or not,
in my day...

35:19.666 --> 35:22.625
that joint
was a classy place.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.750
And we thought
Sandusky was bad.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.416
Thank God you rescued us.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.458
Avec bon plaisir.

35:32.791 --> 35:34.208
Where’s yours?

35:34.250 --> 35:35.791
Teetotaler, baby.

35:35.875 --> 35:38.541
So, where are you guys headed?

35:38.583 --> 35:40.291
New York, New York.

35:40.333 --> 35:42.250
Gypsy’s gonna be
a famous rock star...

35:42.291 --> 35:44.458
and l either want to be...

35:44.500 --> 35:48.916
a photographer, a painter,
a stylist, or a poet.

35:48.958 --> 35:51.250
Here’s to New York City.

35:52.333 --> 35:55.000
May all your dreams come true.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.583
You’re good.

36:02.625 --> 36:05.041
You could be great.

36:05.083 --> 36:07.500
Please. l blew.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.583
Rule number one--never let
the assholes get you down.

36:12.833 --> 36:16.583
Been there, done it,
learned it the hard way.

36:18.333 --> 36:22.041
As a matter of fact,
you...remind me a lot of me...

36:22.083 --> 36:24.083
when l was your age.

36:24.125 --> 36:26.375
Yeah? How come?

36:26.375 --> 36:29.666
You’ve got stars in your eyes.

36:35.625 --> 36:37.166
You lived in New York?

36:39.791 --> 36:42.250
Twenty-one years, baby.

36:43.750 --> 36:46.958
Were you, like, famous?

36:46.958 --> 36:49.625
That is you, isn’t it?

36:53.416 --> 36:54.833
You’re dreamy.

36:54.833 --> 36:57.083
Come on. Let’s hear
some of your records.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.833
You’d have to scrape
the dust off, baby.

36:59.833 --> 37:02.083
Come on. We think
you’re sterling.

37:02.125 --> 37:05.666
That was yesterday.
l live for today.

37:05.708 --> 37:08.541
- Please.
- With sugar on top.

37:08.583 --> 37:11.833
- You know you want to.
- Never.

37:25.750 --> 37:29.791
- This is so awesome.
- Yeah.

37:29.875 --> 37:32.791
God, what the hell are you doing
in the middle of nowhere?

37:32.833 --> 37:37.041
l’m out to pasture, retired.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.708
You don’t miss it--

37:38.750 --> 37:44.500
the big city and all
the buzz-buzz, glamour-glamour?

37:44.541 --> 37:46.708
The truth is no.

37:46.750 --> 37:52.208
The first record was a smash,
but then music changed.

37:52.250 --> 37:56.583
Tits and cocktails went out,
and the hustle came in.

37:56.625 --> 37:58.791
Of course, that didn’t stop me
from beating my head...

37:58.833 --> 38:01.083
against the wall
for 20 years.

38:01.083 --> 38:05.333
One day l just woke up,
looked in the mirror...

38:05.375 --> 38:10.083
and said, ’’Give it up, girlie.’’

38:10.125 --> 38:13.250
l’m sorry. l don’t get it.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.375
You made it. You had a hit.

38:18.458 --> 38:20.458
l had a blast.

38:21.958 --> 38:24.750
Thank Christ l socked away
the big bucks...

38:24.833 --> 38:27.666
while l was still making them.
So now l’m just...

38:27.666 --> 38:29.791
living the good life.

38:29.833 --> 38:33.416
You got a husband and kid
stashed away somewhere?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.708
Never wanted them.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.000
Thanks, honey.

38:49.833 --> 38:53.250
l had a dream,
gave it my best shot.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.166
C’est la vie.

38:56.541 --> 38:58.583
You know what?
This should really be...

38:58.625 --> 39:01.375
on one of those
Rhino reissues.

39:01.375 --> 39:02.666
Excuse me?

39:02.708 --> 39:05.250
Yeah. Lounge is
totally hip again.

39:05.291 --> 39:07.833
You’re yanking my crank.

39:07.875 --> 39:10.416
Wait. Oh, my God.
Total brainstorm.

39:10.458 --> 39:12.250
You should come
to New York with us...

39:12.291 --> 39:13.708
and make your big comeback.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.333
Oh, my God. lt’s brilliant.

39:15.416 --> 39:16.541
l’m...

39:16.583 --> 39:17.708
l’m fift...

39:17.750 --> 39:18.791
for...

39:19.958 --> 39:22.958
Let’s just say
l am no spring chicken.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.291
Seriously, you’d be
totally cutting-edge.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.375
l could photograph
your album covers...

39:27.458 --> 39:29.666
and design your costume.

39:35.041 --> 39:38.083
l have a life here, sweetie.

39:38.166 --> 39:40.000
So did we.

39:41.166 --> 39:44.916
The return
of Miss Bambi LeBleau.

39:44.958 --> 39:47.208
What have you got to lose?

39:47.250 --> 39:51.166
Really. l mean,
you’re a singer.

39:51.208 --> 39:52.916
Fuck.

39:52.916 --> 39:55.833
Singers are meant to sing.

39:59.333 --> 40:02.208
Let me think about it.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.500
- Yes!
- OK.

40:04.541 --> 40:07.458
You think about it,
but l’m going to New York...

40:07.500 --> 40:10.125
first thing
in the morning, so...

40:12.875 --> 40:15.250
But right now,
l really have to pee.

40:16.708 --> 40:19.500
Through the bedroom,
first door on the right.

40:34.708 --> 40:36.875
May l have this dance?

40:36.916 --> 40:38.708
Enchante.

41:26.375 --> 41:29.333
Sorry about that.

41:29.375 --> 41:30.791
Guess what.

41:30.791 --> 41:32.833
Bambi said yes.

41:32.875 --> 41:35.041
Are you sure it’s OK?

41:35.083 --> 41:37.000
Yeah. lt’s awesome.

41:37.041 --> 41:39.458
This is gonna be so cool.

41:42.125 --> 41:46.541
Try as we may, l guess
the dream never dies.

41:46.625 --> 41:48.500
Does it?

41:48.500 --> 41:51.333
No, l guess it doesn’t.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.833
- What happened?
- Don’t worry about it.

42:57.875 --> 43:00.500
- l loved her.
- Me, too.

43:00.541 --> 43:03.041
Then what is your problem?

43:18.458 --> 43:20.791
You’re going the wrong way.

43:20.833 --> 43:22.625
Where are you going?

43:22.666 --> 43:24.416
Home.

43:24.458 --> 43:26.458
This was stupid.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.291
Your ass belongs
back in school.

43:28.333 --> 43:31.083
Turn around...please.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.875
Fuck. Fuck.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.916
The night that Velvet left...

44:14.958 --> 44:17.791
dad just didn’t know
how to deal, you know.

44:17.833 --> 44:19.958
So he looked me
straight in the eye...

44:20.000 --> 44:24.083
and he said,
’’Your mother left us...

44:24.125 --> 44:29.166
’’because she loved her dreams
more than she loved us.’’

44:32.416 --> 44:35.458
Bambi never had a hit.

44:35.458 --> 44:38.125
She’s a drunk.

44:38.166 --> 44:41.625
She rolled the dice,
and she came up bust.

44:45.666 --> 44:47.500
Just like Velvet.

44:49.166 --> 44:50.875
Bingo.

44:50.916 --> 44:54.166
So you abandoned her
like Velvet did you?

44:55.833 --> 45:00.416
Maybe l refuse to give up
my life for a pipedream.

45:04.791 --> 45:06.333
We’re going home now.

45:06.375 --> 45:08.458
Dad and Lois
must be worried sick.

45:08.500 --> 45:11.833
They’re grownups. They can
take care of themselves.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.666
l’m not doing it
to my dad again. Get in the car.

45:23.791 --> 45:26.625
What happened at talent night?

45:26.666 --> 45:28.125
Excuse me?

45:28.166 --> 45:30.083
ln third grade.

45:30.125 --> 45:32.875
Screw you.

45:32.916 --> 45:35.666
No. Gypsy, please.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.083
Just tell me.

45:41.125 --> 45:42.625
All right.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.916
Spring jubilee, talent night.

45:50.958 --> 45:55.833
Velvet taught me one
of her favorite Stevie songs.

45:55.875 --> 45:58.666
We practiced for weeks.

45:58.708 --> 46:02.208
And dad showed me
the chords on the guitar.

46:02.250 --> 46:06.500
Anyway...a week before
my big debut...

46:06.541 --> 46:09.083
Velvet splits.

46:10.500 --> 46:12.041
But l go through
with it anyway...

46:12.125 --> 46:18.291
because she’s gonna show,
right? l mean...

46:19.791 --> 46:22.458
She’s got to show.

46:23.958 --> 46:26.375
So...

46:26.416 --> 46:29.291
all the cutesie little
kiddies...

46:29.333 --> 46:32.958
and their perfect
mommies and daddies are there.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.458
And l get up on the stage...

46:34.500 --> 46:36.625
singing and playing
my little guitar...

46:39.791 --> 46:42.250
And l pissed my dress.

46:45.458 --> 46:50.541
lt ran down my leg
and dripped off the stage.

46:52.166 --> 46:56.250
And some guy with a mop
came out...

46:56.291 --> 47:00.333
and told me to get back
to the audience...

47:00.375 --> 47:02.666
and go find my mom.

47:07.041 --> 47:10.083
Come here, sweetie.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.750
Cool. Pick him up.

47:59.833 --> 48:03.125
- Are you kidding?
- Come on. The Amish rock.

48:12.750 --> 48:14.291
Hello.

48:14.375 --> 48:17.083
l’m Zachariah.

48:17.083 --> 48:18.916
l’m running away.

48:23.625 --> 48:25.916
OK.

48:28.291 --> 48:33.625
So, Zachariah, have you ever
been in a car before?

48:33.666 --> 48:35.958
Never one this radical.

48:37.625 --> 48:39.625
Do either of you
have a cigarette?

48:39.666 --> 48:41.208
You can smoke?

48:41.250 --> 48:45.625
As of this moment, l can do
anything l damn well please.

48:48.791 --> 48:52.333
So, you running from something?

48:52.416 --> 48:54.833
Conformity.

48:54.875 --> 48:56.291
Boredom.

48:56.333 --> 48:57.833
And cows.

49:00.125 --> 49:01.958
May l pump?

49:02.000 --> 49:03.125
Sure.

49:03.166 --> 49:04.625
Awesome.

49:07.166 --> 49:08.666
What do l do?

49:08.666 --> 49:10.625
OK, no problem.

49:10.666 --> 49:13.625
First, you unscrew
the gas cap, like so.

49:13.708 --> 49:15.750
On some cars, there’s a button
on the inside...

49:15.750 --> 49:18.583
you have to press to unlock it,
but this is an older model.

49:18.625 --> 49:22.541
And then you make
your octane selection.

49:22.583 --> 49:27.250
We’re on a budget,
so we’ll use this one.

49:27.291 --> 49:30.083
And then you put it
in the hole...

49:30.125 --> 49:32.250
and you simply pump away.

49:33.791 --> 49:35.041
Yeah.

49:39.958 --> 49:42.958
l really like your clothes.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.541
l’m dying to get out of mine.

49:52.583 --> 49:54.625
He’s gorgeous.

49:54.666 --> 49:57.500
Come on, man.
So is Norman Bates.

49:57.541 --> 49:59.625
l know l would kill
for that hat.

49:59.666 --> 50:01.666
When you were walking
over here...

50:01.708 --> 50:03.625
l think l saw him
staring at your ass.

50:03.666 --> 50:06.375
- Shut up.
- l’m not kidding.

50:09.625 --> 50:12.666
Just my luck--an Amish sodomist.

50:12.708 --> 50:14.916
Go for it.

50:14.958 --> 50:17.000
What are you looking at?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.125
Damn, honey, l don’t know.
You ask them.

50:19.166 --> 50:21.958
Are you guys some kind
of dragon queens or something?

50:22.041 --> 50:24.833
- l’m sorry?
- Don’t even bother.

50:29.666 --> 50:32.666
Look, honey, an Amish.

50:32.708 --> 50:35.500
You people sure make
a kick-ass pie.

50:35.541 --> 50:38.125
That’s some good-eating pie.

50:38.166 --> 50:39.583
What the fuck?

50:51.458 --> 50:53.500
Fucking perverts.

50:55.708 --> 50:57.166
Look. Check it out.

52:42.916 --> 52:45.250
We’re hungry, mommy.

52:45.291 --> 52:47.000
l am starving.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.500
Anything in particular?

52:50.250 --> 52:51.875
May l make a request?

53:06.208 --> 53:08.291
Eat your Whopper
before it gets cold.

53:08.333 --> 53:11.791
Whopper? Oh, yes. Thank you.

53:20.125 --> 53:22.666
l have a secret confession.

53:22.708 --> 53:24.208
l was a fast-food virgin.

53:29.916 --> 53:32.833
l have a secret
confession, too.

53:32.875 --> 53:35.875
Yeah? What is it?

53:35.916 --> 53:41.833
OK. l’ve never really
said this to anyone before...

53:41.875 --> 53:46.625
but...l’m kind of a virgin, too.

53:46.666 --> 53:49.083
What?

53:49.083 --> 53:51.375
Normally l’m really not
this forward...

53:51.416 --> 53:54.541
but the light is so beautiful
right now...

53:54.583 --> 53:58.291
and l’m a little tipsy,
and l...

54:02.333 --> 54:04.375
l think you’re
the most beautiful man...

54:04.416 --> 54:06.166
that l’ve ever seen.

54:09.666 --> 54:10.875
Me?

54:17.791 --> 54:19.541
l’m flattered, but...

54:28.791 --> 54:30.000
Oh, God.

54:30.083 --> 54:31.625
l’m sorry.

54:33.125 --> 54:35.625
He does this. lt’s OK.
He’ll be back.

54:40.333 --> 54:42.375
Who are you
fucking girls pledging?

54:42.375 --> 54:44.791
Sir, Sigma Alpha Sigma, sir.

54:44.833 --> 54:46.208
Excuse me?

54:46.250 --> 54:48.666
Sir, Sigma Alpha
fucking Sigma, sir.

54:48.708 --> 54:52.500
That’s better.
Troy, you want to crash here?

54:52.541 --> 54:54.541
Right on.

54:54.583 --> 54:58.750
OK, guys. Get up. Up!

54:58.791 --> 55:00.708
March. Go.

55:04.666 --> 55:06.666
After a bottle of this...

55:06.708 --> 55:10.708
our asses are camping
right here tonight.

55:14.791 --> 55:18.625
Absinthe--the green fairy.

55:19.666 --> 55:21.708
- Hey.

55:21.750 --> 55:23.166
- Hey.

55:23.208 --> 55:25.541
So, where are your robots?

55:25.583 --> 55:30.833
They’re in the camper.
l needed a break from them.

55:30.875 --> 55:32.791
Yeah, l bet you did.

56:41.250 --> 56:42.458
Hi.

56:55.833 --> 56:58.958
This stuff completely fucked me.

57:08.041 --> 57:09.958
Who the fuck was that?

57:10.000 --> 57:11.791
l don’t know.

57:18.958 --> 57:20.750
Wait, wait.

57:21.958 --> 57:23.958
Could you leave it on?

57:23.958 --> 57:25.833
OK.

57:25.875 --> 57:28.208
OK. lt’s OK.

57:28.250 --> 57:29.416
OK.

57:41.666 --> 57:44.166
Hey.

57:44.208 --> 57:45.958
Hey, there.

57:51.291 --> 57:54.416
OK, l think there’s...

57:54.458 --> 57:56.333
some kind of twisted fag
sex ring going on here.

57:56.333 --> 57:57.458
Really?

57:57.500 --> 57:58.916
That guy just looked at us...

57:59.000 --> 58:00.541
like he wanted to peel off
our boxer shorts...

58:00.583 --> 58:03.666
and eat us for breakfast.

58:03.708 --> 58:05.541
That is so wrong.

58:05.583 --> 58:08.000
This is a public place.

58:08.041 --> 58:09.500
Damn queers, man.

58:09.541 --> 58:11.666
Yeah.

58:11.708 --> 58:14.416
You can’t trust the...

58:14.416 --> 58:16.958
l don’t even wear boxers.

58:26.625 --> 58:28.750
What is that?

58:28.791 --> 58:30.875
lt’s a ring.

58:42.458 --> 58:44.708
l’m so fucking trashed.

59:28.875 --> 59:31.916
You are so beautiful.
You don’t even know it.

59:49.708 --> 59:52.166
Look at me.

01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:57.041
You gonna be all right?

01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:59.583
l can go all by myself
now, daddy.

01:00:59.666 --> 01:01:02.416
l’m a big boy now.

01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:04.375
l’ll be right out here
if you need me.

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:52.875
Just think,
this time tomorrow...

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:55.166
we’ll be in New York City.

01:01:57.333 --> 01:02:00.000
The Big Apple.

01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:03.583
God, l was so fucking nervous
about the audition.

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:06.625
We are talking
killer stage fright.

01:02:06.666 --> 01:02:09.875
But now that l know
you’re gonna be there...

01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:14.625
Buzz-buzz.

01:02:14.666 --> 01:02:17.125
Glamour-glamour.

01:02:21.791 --> 01:02:24.458
We’re closed.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.208
l guess we better
put our clothes on.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.125
You make me feel warm.

01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:18.458
Don’t forget me.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.458
OK.

01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:57.375
No one has ever
touched me like you.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:02.625
l just wanted you
to know that.

01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:05.833
OK, l know it.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.791
Forgive me, Gypsy.

01:04:11.833 --> 01:04:14.833
l thought
this was what l wanted.

01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:19.083
l don’t understand.

01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:21.250
l’m going back.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:23.916
Back?

01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:25.125
Home.

01:04:25.166 --> 01:04:27.083
l am so, so sorry.

01:04:27.125 --> 01:04:29.208
What did l do wrong?

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.375
Nothing.

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:34.958
No, you know what?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.500
l’m not gonna let you.

01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:38.625
l’m married.

01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:43.583
And we’re gonna have a baby.

01:04:46.833 --> 01:04:49.791
l will never forget you.

01:04:49.833 --> 01:04:53.250
You’re just like
all the rest, huh?

01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:54.833
Fucking throw me
in the garbage.

01:04:54.916 --> 01:04:56.500
Do me a favor.

01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:58.166
The next time you want
some pussy on the side...

01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:00.208
you can fuck
a goddamn sheep...

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:02.500
and leave us women alone.

01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:04.958
Get out!

01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:25.458
Hey, baby.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.791
How was it?

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:32.500
Where is he?

01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:39.791
Why can’t they all
be like you?

01:05:40.791 --> 01:05:42.458
You OK?

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:47.333
What’s wrong?

01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:48.958
Where’s Troy?

01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:54.166
You hooked up with him.

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:59.000
Oh, my God.

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:05.041
l thought l would have
been petrified...

01:06:05.083 --> 01:06:07.666
but l just dove
right in there.

01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:10.958
You said you weren’t even
into him. l don’t believe this.

01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:15.000
You were so right
about the thumb thing.

01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:17.708
This is great.

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.625
This is just
fucking sterling.

01:06:19.666 --> 01:06:21.416
What’s wrong with you?

01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:23.541
Now you can go join
the fag club...

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:26.583
get a tan, big muscles...

01:06:26.625 --> 01:06:29.125
some gorgeous boyfriend.

01:06:29.166 --> 01:06:30.791
Don’t make me laugh.

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:32.666
l’m just wondering what the hell
happens to me...

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:35.166
now that you’ve graduated
to butt-fucking.

01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:38.791
Where do l fit in?

01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:45.458
Why is it always about you?

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.083
That’s bullshit.
lt’s not always--

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.625
No, it’s always about you.

01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:51.791
All you can ever think about
is your own fat ass!

01:06:54.333 --> 01:06:55.833
Where are you going?

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:57.583
l need my own space right now!

01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:03.833
What are you doing?

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.333
Oh, my God.

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.500
Are you OK?

01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:17.583
Maybe l’ll just
catch a ride with Troy.

01:07:17.625 --> 01:07:19.250
Shit. lf there is
one scratch on--

01:07:19.291 --> 01:07:21.250
Have a nice life!

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:27.708
Fuck.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.333
The sun’s up.

01:08:27.666 --> 01:08:29.500
Goddamn it!

01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:32.082
You’re right!

01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:34.791
OK?

01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:40.791
Look, what you said...

01:08:40.832 --> 01:08:46.291
about how l’m,
you know, selfish or whatever.

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:48.291
l’ve been up all night.

01:08:52.291 --> 01:08:56.291
You needed me,
and l wasn’t there...

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:57.957
and then...

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:01.125
l’m sorry.

01:09:02.791 --> 01:09:04.125
OK?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.791
Look, baby, l was just a mess
after Zachariah.

01:09:13.291 --> 01:09:14.500
What did he do to you?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.916
He fucked me,
and then he dumped me...

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:19.750
for his wife.

01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.625
Oh, my God. He’s married?

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:37.291
l always wondered how l’d feel
when you finally did the nasty.

01:09:37.291 --> 01:09:41.250
Part of me would be
really happy for you.

01:09:41.332 --> 01:09:44.625
Then the selfish bitch
was always scared shitless.

01:09:44.666 --> 01:09:46.125
Why?

01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:49.291
Because...l don’t want
to lose what we have.

01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:51.625
Which is what?

01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:54.375
Something sick and twisted...

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:56.916
that we both desperately
need therapy for.

01:09:58.291 --> 01:10:02.791
Look, all l know is,
when l’m with you...

01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:07.958
l was just about to say
something really corny.

01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:12.958
l’m afraid you’re gonna give
your love to someone else.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.000
But enough about me.

01:10:21.041 --> 01:10:23.500
Let’s talk about you.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.333
What do you mean?

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.000
l mean...

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:33.208
You can talk to me.
Come on.

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:35.833
l won’t bite you.

01:10:38.208 --> 01:10:39.833
OK.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:44.666
l guess l thought that...

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:47.041
l was in love with you.

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:49.625
And l’m not.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.333
lt’s more like...
l worship you.

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:07.916
l’m a fag.

01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:12.375
l’m really fucking gay.

01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:22.166
l’m scared.

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:26.000
l know.

01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:29.333
You’re gonna be OK.

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:02.000
You are so fucking dead!

01:13:16.666 --> 01:13:18.625
- Valley freak!
- Faggot!

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.291
Oh, my God.

01:14:09.833 --> 01:14:12.625
Oh, yes, Lord.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.208
We’re home.

01:15:47.083 --> 01:15:49.041
Children of the night.

01:15:57.291 --> 01:16:00.875
l, the Empress
Chi Chi Valenti...

01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:10.625
welcome you to the fifth annual
’’Night of a Thousand Stevies!’’

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.916
Silence!

01:16:12.958 --> 01:16:17.333
Goddess Nicks, l call out.

01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:20.875
lf you are present,
reveal yourself.

01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:25.416
Wherever you are tonight...

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:28.375
the recording studios
of Los Angeles...

01:16:28.416 --> 01:16:32.291
your desert home
in Paradise Valley, Arizona...

01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:38.583
please hear our call!

01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:40.916
Please welcome
our first performer...

01:16:40.958 --> 01:16:48.458
on this most magical evening--
the lovely Enchantress.

01:17:16.458 --> 01:17:17.958
Ask her.

01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:22.083
- Love the look, lady.
- Thanks.

01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:26.958
l would really like
to perform here tonight...

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.541
but l missed the audition.

01:17:28.541 --> 01:17:31.000
l’m sorry.
lt’s totally packed. l don’t...

01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:33.416
Do you know Velvet Vale?

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:40.875
Anybody here
who’s been here awhile?

01:17:40.916 --> 01:17:43.000
Yeah. Chi Chi. She should be
back there somewhere.

01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:44.791
OK. Thanks.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:53.375
- Hi. l’m Danny.
- l’m Gypsy 83.

01:17:54.791 --> 01:17:56.750
The judges will adore your cape.

01:17:56.791 --> 01:18:01.041
Thank you. Actually, he deserves
all the credit, though.

01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:06.208
This is Clive, by the way.
Excuse me.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:12.041
l’m Hazleton.

01:18:12.041 --> 01:18:13.333
Hi.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.791
So, you’re into Poppy Z, right?

01:18:25.833 --> 01:18:28.041
Yeah, of course.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.375
Oh, my God.
We have so much in common.

01:18:29.416 --> 01:18:31.541
l’m obsessed with ’’Lost Souls,’’
you know.

01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:35.291
lt’s so lyrical and completely
and totally sensual.

01:18:35.333 --> 01:18:37.000
Yeah. What a great album.

01:18:39.708 --> 01:18:44.208
’’Lost Souls’’
is a book, sweetie.

01:18:44.208 --> 01:18:46.791
Poppy writes books.

01:18:49.083 --> 01:18:51.000
l’m kind of new at this.

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:53.416
Poser!

01:18:53.416 --> 01:18:56.791
They’re just jealous
because l like you.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.125
Yeah, right.

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.500
Hazleton, darling,
l think your boyfriend...

01:19:00.541 --> 01:19:04.125
needs to use the bathroom
to powder his nose.

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:15.208
Why don’t you try being a freak
out in the real world?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.916
You catty cunts.

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:26.916
Honey, here.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:32.458
Let me see.

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:35.458
lt’s Robbie.

01:19:38.458 --> 01:19:40.625
My name is Robbie.

01:19:44.791 --> 01:19:47.125
l always hated it.

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:52.375
l mean, you know,
’’Clive’’ is way edgier, right?

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.083
l just don’t
fit in...anywhere.

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:30.041
Could l see Chi Chi?

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.916
My, aren’t you the cat’s meow?

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.500
l know that you’re busy...

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:47.833
but l drove all the way
from Ohio...

01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:49.500
to perform here tonight.

01:20:49.541 --> 01:20:52.000
Did you audition?

01:20:52.041 --> 01:20:53.791
No. We got hung up.

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:56.666
Sorry, hons.

01:21:04.541 --> 01:21:05.750
Do you know her?

01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:08.625
That’s Velvet.

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:10.916
ls she here?

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:15.125
Chi Chi needs privacy.

01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:17.208
Yes, Empress.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.791
ls she performing tonight?

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.416
Open it.

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.791
This is me.

01:21:37.833 --> 01:21:41.500
You have your mother’s eyes...

01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:43.583
Gypsy.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.375
You didn’t get
your mother’s poems?

01:21:48.416 --> 01:21:49.666
No.

01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:53.958
She wrote to you for years.
She never heard back.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.541
No, l never got any poems.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.916
Why isn’t she wearing this?

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.625
l’m sorry.

01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:11.250
When?

01:22:11.291 --> 01:22:13.791
Four years ago.

01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:16.916
Why didn’t she
come back for me?

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:30.041
My sweet darling, l’m so sorry.

01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:40.625
Hello.

01:22:40.666 --> 01:22:42.333
Daddy.

01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:45.208
Sweetie, are you OK?

01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:47.500
Where are you?

01:22:47.541 --> 01:22:49.000
l’m in New York.

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.875
l thought so.

01:22:51.916 --> 01:22:54.333
Are you sure you’re OK?

01:22:56.166 --> 01:22:58.916
l’m gonna sing tonight, dad.

01:22:58.958 --> 01:23:01.375
l wish you were here
to watch me.

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:05.666
Yeah, me, too.

01:23:07.708 --> 01:23:12.208
You know, l decided
to finish the studio.

01:23:12.208 --> 01:23:15.166
l’ve been working like a dog
since you’ve been gone...

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:20.291
and l got the sixteen-track
working really good...

01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:23.125
and l thought,
as soon as you get back...

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:26.750
we could start working
on that album.

01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:29.708
Why didn’t you tell me
about the poems?

01:23:35.166 --> 01:23:37.500
Did she recognize you?

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.041
She’s dead.

01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:51.666
She killed herself, daddy.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:03.500
And you want to be
just like her, huh?

01:24:11.166 --> 01:24:14.000
l love you, sweetheart.

01:24:14.041 --> 01:24:16.583
Please come home.

01:24:18.958 --> 01:24:22.125
l’m your daughter, dad.
l’m not your wife.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.458
l love you, too.
l’ll call you soon.

01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:42.541
Please welcome the daughter
of Mother legend Velvet Vale...

01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:45.833
Gypsy 83!

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.833
l wrote this song for my mother.

01:25:18.125 --> 01:25:19.958
Lullabies

01:25:21.958 --> 01:25:24.625
Her voice so sweet

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:30.708
l remember every moment

01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:35.458
How she sang me fast asleep

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.958
And then the emptiness

01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:41.500
The angry lace

01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:48.166
All those gray Novembers

01:25:48.208 --> 01:25:52.958
Lost, alone, can’t find my way

01:25:53.041 --> 01:25:57.791
But you come running,
arms wide open

01:25:57.833 --> 01:26:02.083
Pick me up,
and say we’re spinning

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:05.708
Mama’s home,
her journey’s done

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:10.291
Gonna kiss your tears away

01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:14.625
And you come running
with your arms wide open

01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:18.583
Pick me up,
hey, we’re spinning

01:26:18.666 --> 01:26:22.541
Mama’s home,
her journey’s done

01:26:22.541 --> 01:26:27.875
Gonna kiss your tears away

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:32.125
Now l’m awake

01:26:32.166 --> 01:26:34.166
And l can see

01:26:35.916 --> 01:26:40.833
Oh, the nightbird call
you heard so strong

01:26:40.916 --> 01:26:47.583
You passed along to me

01:26:47.625 --> 01:26:51.000
And l’m still running,
arms wide open

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.875
Hold you tight
and pray l’m dreaming

01:26:54.916 --> 01:26:58.458
Take me home
with your sweet song

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:02.416
No more tears to wipe away

01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:06.416
And l’m still running,
arms wide open

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:10.208
Hold you tight
and pray l’m dreaming

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:13.958
Take me home
with your sweet song

01:27:13.958 --> 01:27:15.875
And promise me

01:27:15.916 --> 01:27:24.750
Promise me you’ll stay

01:27:24.833 --> 01:27:27.291
Lullabies

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:44.583
Voice so sweet

01:28:25.541 --> 01:28:28.583
Did you find it OK?

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:30.541
Yeah.

01:28:30.583 --> 01:28:33.250
OK.

01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:36.666
l know you’re doing
the right thing...

01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:38.416
but l still can’t help
but try and think...

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:41.125
of things to make you stay.
