How did Robert die? All they'll tell
us is that it was a military accident.

00:04.906 --> 00:07.289
My sister's death
destroyed my family

00:07.421 --> 00:09.382
and they deserve to be punished!

00:12.312 --> 00:13.812
We came here to rob you.

00:13.929 --> 00:16.328
I need you to leave
and not come back.

00:16.524 --> 00:17.556
Okay.

00:17.658 --> 00:21.718
- You said I can trust you! Stop! Stop, Liam!
- I know who killed your father!

00:22.251 --> 00:25.147
Get me close enough
and I'll kill him myself.

00:29.209 --> 00:30.897
These children are illegitimate.

00:31.037 --> 00:32.747
Tell us it isn't true.

00:32.881 --> 00:35.006
- What do you do?
- I'm a dominatrix.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.991
Has he finally stopped crying?

00:39.264 --> 00:43.037
You take away my future,
I take away yours.

00:43.686 --> 00:45.280

00:45.381 --> 00:47.980
My son is the rightful heir
to the throne

00:48.108 --> 00:50.256

00:50.405 --> 00:52.022

I know in my heart this

00:54.834 --> 00:57.420
inspiring and visionary,
I truly do.

But this will be
the Eleanor warrant.

07:50.105 --> 07:51.942
You could endorse condoms

07:52.106 --> 07:54.504
or a personal lubricant,
perhaps a firearm.

07:55.426 --> 07:56.461
I'm kidding.

07:56.528 --> 07:59.387
Endorse something you enjoy,
other than those things.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.504
Like tea or chocolate.

08:01.590 --> 08:02.871
Yeah, but why now?

The Princess Eleanor line of

12:51.056 --> 12:52.087

12:52.152 --> 12:54.627
Ele-noir.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.924
Even Beyonce has her own scent.

12:58.961 --> 13:01.290
Urgh, it smells like
a whore house.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.994

13:18.005 --> 13:19.605
Interesting.

13:19.741 --> 13:23.100
How is this any different
than the first model?

13:23.756 --> 13:25.179
More reliable.

13:25.506 --> 13:27.114
A little less stubborn.

13:27.413 --> 13:30.694
And this version
is sorry for the last one.

13:31.631 --> 13:34.116
And would never take your
endorsement for granted.

13:42.381 --> 13:44.631
Well, it certainly has
nice lines.

13:52.358 --> 13:55.175

demonstration is in order.

13:56.006 --> 13:57.978

14:16.959 --> 14:19.166
I don't want to do it.

14:19.381 --> 14:22.788
I don't want to put my name on
worthless things just because I can.

14:22.866 --> 14:24.905
I mean, who even cares about
this stuff?

14:25.225 --> 14:28.772
Um, a nation full of people.
Women and young girls.

14:28.881 --> 14:31.170
Well, I'm not their role model
or their personal stylist.

14:31.233 --> 14:33.447
I just do what I do
and they should, too.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.515
Yeah, but people look up to you.

14:35.780 --> 14:39.053
They like your style, your
attitude, your confidence.

14:42.842 --> 14:44.944
I'm not that confident.

14:45.505 --> 14:47.471
But you fake it well.

14:48.990 --> 14:50.850
You find the right clothes,
put on the right mask.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.530
They see this brave,
fearless girl,

14:53.577 --> 14:56.124
who is defiantly
and perfectly herself.

14:56.327 --> 14:59.194
No matter how hard anyone tries
to make her something else.

15:00.077 --> 15:02.280
It... it compels them.

15:02.475 --> 15:04.108
And they think...

15:04.272 --> 15:07.327
"Maybe if I did my eyes
like this,"

15:07.420 --> 15:09.750
I could be a small step
closer to who I wanna be

15:09.833 --> 15:13.225
"and a little less of what
the world... expects me to be."

15:15.502 --> 15:17.603
I do like this eyeliner.

15:20.029 --> 15:22.229
I like the eyes.

15:34.486 --> 15:36.811
I'm gonna make a call.

15:39.903 --> 15:41.327
Jasper...

15:43.483 --> 15:45.619
I've decided to forgive you.

15:46.827 --> 15:48.342
For what?

15:48.702 --> 15:50.290
All of it.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.000
Okay.

15:59.468 --> 16:01.535
So where do we go from here?

16:02.860 --> 16:05.260
Maybe ask me out sometime.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.699
Possibly tonight.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.155
Okay.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.709
Uh, I will.

16:14.342 --> 16:15.642
Yep.

16:29.398 --> 16:30.827
Yes!

16:35.526 --> 16:36.859
Mr hill.

16:38.577 --> 16:39.616
Your majesty.

16:39.702 --> 16:42.444
We have an opening for
the king's head of security,

16:42.577 --> 16:44.803
which is also the queen's
head of security.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.347
I'm choosing the person
to fill that position.

16:47.447 --> 16:49.113
I'd like it to be you.

16:50.137 --> 16:51.749
Your majesty, I have...

16:51.827 --> 16:55.577
A daughter and I know you're
quite protective of her.

16:55.975 --> 16:57.467
Will you, at least, consider it?

16:57.604 --> 16:58.803
Of course.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.730
Oh. One more thing.

17:04.030 --> 17:07.194
This hashtag king Liam movement,

17:07.342 --> 17:08.935
I'd like to know
where it started.

17:09.003 --> 17:11.577
Or, better still,
who started it.

17:12.058 --> 17:13.424
Ma'am.

17:25.104 --> 17:27.388
Hello. Hi.
Hi.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.342
Did you have sugary cereal
when you were a kid?

17:30.436 --> 17:31.483
Never. Not once.

17:31.572 --> 17:35.342
Me, neither. You know how you
always want what you can't have?

17:35.764 --> 17:38.030
I'm having Froot Loops
and then apple Jacks

17:38.100 --> 17:39.670
and then honey smacks.

17:39.780 --> 17:41.358
Whatever those are.

17:41.592 --> 17:44.584
- You're out of control.
- I know. It feels good.

17:45.225 --> 17:47.209
You want some?
No, I'm good.

17:49.452 --> 17:52.655
That why you're trying to hide
your hangover beneath that cap?

17:54.148 --> 17:56.381
I've been thinking
about Robert a lot lately.

17:58.233 --> 17:59.889
Missing him.

18:00.327 --> 18:02.522
Asking myself how he would
have handled things.

18:02.913 --> 18:04.553
Did you contact Ophelia?

18:04.741 --> 18:06.326
I tried.

18:06.436 --> 18:08.361
Her phone is disconnected.

18:08.474 --> 18:11.375
Her social media is closed.
I even flew to New York.

18:11.803 --> 18:13.433
Her flat's empty.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.202
No forwarding address.

18:16.577 --> 18:19.944
You didn't betray her, Liam.
Her father did.

18:20.372 --> 18:22.733
And only two things
are going to make it better.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.946
Absolving yourself of that
guilt is one of them.

18:26.428 --> 18:28.952
- What's the other?
- Cocoa krispies.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.006
- You're a good friend.
- You know that?

18:34.100 --> 18:35.922
I am a damn good friend.

18:36.163 --> 18:38.436
Now... have some Froot Loops.

18:39.491 --> 18:41.952
They're the gateway drug
to apple Jacks.

18:45.256 --> 18:46.533
Mm!

18:46.602 --> 18:48.502
Holy shit, this is good.

18:49.682 --> 18:51.081
All right.

18:56.741 --> 18:59.513
Ah. The king has agreed to speak with you.
He's on his way now.

18:59.624 --> 19:02.311
I've also selected
a potential lord Chamberlain.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.116
And your Booty call is waiting.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.475
What? Really?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.095
This place is weird.

19:15.303 --> 19:17.045
You wanted to see me?

19:24.147 --> 19:26.506
Do you plan on attending
parliament in this thing?

19:26.655 --> 19:28.475
We're the Royal family.

19:28.630 --> 19:32.165
I can go months without being
seen in person. Maybe even years.

19:32.311 --> 19:34.194
Whatever you say, bubble boy.

19:35.272 --> 19:37.131
But I see two flies
in your lube.

19:37.319 --> 19:38.985
One is this little thing
called cancer.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.678
And two... is this.

19:41.811 --> 19:43.924
'You killed her, didn't you?'

19:43.992 --> 19:46.178
Jeffrey Stewart is not
going away.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.895
He's threatening to release the
footage unless we meet with him.

19:48.964 --> 19:50.225
So?

19:50.506 --> 19:52.092
So we still have a problem.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.925
No. You still have a problem.

19:55.077 --> 19:59.178
As a matter of fact, I think I might
reach out to our friend, Jeff.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.398
See if he and I can make a deal.

20:01.663 --> 20:05.011
You really are a hideous little
backstabber, aren't you?

20:05.139 --> 20:08.147
No. I'm more than happy
to stab you in the front.

20:08.342 --> 20:10.311
Like Ted stabbed your husband.

20:11.428 --> 20:13.249
Roll away.

20:15.584 --> 20:19.616
Geez, if looks could kill,
you'd be your mother.

20:28.858 --> 20:31.271
- Your majesty.
- Hm. You'll do.

Follow me.

20:36.557 --> 20:38.723
Close the door.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.045
- You've spoken to Rachel?
- I have.

20:47.242 --> 20:49.225
Very good.

20:50.905 --> 20:52.859

21:16.889 --> 21:18.577

21:18.766 --> 21:20.332

23:31.679 --> 23:34.484
I've been offered the
head of security position.
