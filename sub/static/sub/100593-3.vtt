01:48.984 --> 01:52.905
I am vengeance.
I am the night. I am Batman.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.621
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.551
Take it easy.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.443
What the hell is he wearing?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.363
He's Batman.
It's Halloween this weekend, Dad.

02:34.947 --> 02:35.948
Looking good, buddy.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.283
Isn't he a little old for that?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.160
Please.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.666
You know, Dad,
you can view this as an opportunity.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.168
You know, be with us, not have to work.

02:48.252 --> 02:51.672
Spend some time with your grandkids,
your family. We'll just take care of you.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.216
I don't need taking care of, Michael.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.010
Dad, come on.
It doesn't have to be a bad thing.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.012
This could be a new beginning.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.391
You know, I got all the exercise equipment
that the trainer recommended.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.393
And she'll be here
to start rehab tomorrow.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.271
-It's like I tell my patients--
-You're a gastroenterologist.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.732
I still have to tell them stuff.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.612
Okay.
We've got Dylan's room all set up for you.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.656
Where's the kid gonna sleep?

03:18.115 --> 03:19.575
Oh, upstairs with Bryce.

03:19.658 --> 03:23.036
And we're just down the hall if you need
us for any reason at all during the night.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.790
I think I can handle
being unconscious for six hours.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.876
Be the best six hours of my day.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.670
You know, Joe,

03:33.005 --> 03:36.550
if at any point you wanna talk about
how you're feeling, I'm around.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.594
In my practice,

03:38.677 --> 03:41.805
I've counseled a lot of patients going
through similar transitions with aging

03:41.889 --> 03:45.017
and the grief that goes with that.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.226
I don't feel any grief.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.020
Oh, no, no. Yeah.

03:48.103 --> 03:51.982
I'm just saying that it's natural,
you know, if there's some sense of loss--

03:52.065 --> 03:53.817
And I'm not feeling any loss.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.071
Well, I am here if you wanna talk.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.548
You're into comics, huh?

04:19.426 --> 04:21.261
You're-- You feeling any better?

04:21.345 --> 04:23.430
Since an hour ago? No.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.938
You can read any of my comics
if you'd like.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.692
I made these.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.909
You made Batman?

04:43.992 --> 04:46.703
Well, no. I'm trying to make my own.

04:48.080 --> 04:54.586
I wanna be like the next Neal Adams.
The guy who made Batman.

04:56.463 --> 05:00.467
-I need to be alone, kid.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.929
If you need anything, just let me know.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.309
I will have to come in and feed him
every once in a while, but yeah.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.151
Sorry.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.280
-Jesus, Dyl. Why don't you knock?
-Sorry.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.323
Do you need something?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.577
Why is Grandpa such a jerk?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.787
I don't know. He's old.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.707
Can we talk about this,
like, any other time?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.126
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.086
What are you doing?

05:36.170 --> 05:37.713
Mom said I'm sleeping here.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.356
Why aren't you in Bryce's room?

05:57.232 --> 05:58.650
I like this better.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.908
-Listen, I know. Grandpa can be a bit--
-Mean.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.576
-Well--
-Dad, he's just mean.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.161
Well...

06:09.244 --> 06:11.830
Look, he's had a different life.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.209
His dad died young. He had to be tough.

06:16.293 --> 06:20.130
So, I don't know.
Maybe we can cut him a little slack.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.343
-Okay?
-Okay.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.807
All right.
Don't stay up too late, pal. Okay?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.563
-Good night.
-Good night. Love you.

06:58.961 --> 07:03.173
All right. Let's see where you are.
So, let me see if you can lift the foot.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.137
All right. Okay. It's okay.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.473
I have patients too. Important ones.

07:11.557 --> 07:14.977
I'm not suggesting yours aren't important,
just that mine aren't less important.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.855
My 3:00 has a colon
that's completely wrapped around itself.

07:17.938 --> 07:18.939
So gross, Dad.

07:19.022 --> 07:22.401
Sorry, Bryce, but this is what I do for a
living. People's colons paid for your car.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.319
Hey, can you drive Dylan home from school?

07:24.403 --> 07:26.864
-Can he wait till I'm done with practice?
-That's like 6:30.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.449
-Dylan, be flexible.
-Stop. I'll get him.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.203
What else am I doing around here?
Let me have the keys.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.956
Well, Dad, I don't think you can drive.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.333
I can drive, Michael. It's my left leg.

07:49.887 --> 07:56.101
Hey, Brady. Did you get my texts?
So, you wanna start at your house or mine?

07:56.185 --> 07:57.686
Actually, Dylan, I was thinking.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.897
This year I might have something
I need to do.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.232
What are you talking about?

08:03.150 --> 08:06.403
We always spend Halloween together.
Since, like, preschool.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.991
No, I know. But this year
I was thinking of going to the dance.

08:11.074 --> 08:15.662
A dance? On Halloween?
What are you talking about?

08:15.746 --> 08:17.331
-It's just that--
-Hey, Brady.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.833
Hey. One sec.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.543
Okay.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.172
I'm sorry, Dylan.
Just not this year, but...

08:25.881 --> 08:27.257
I'll catch up with you.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.594
Hey, Maya, wait up.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.388
Yeah, catch you later.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.863
Boys, I'm back.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.156
-Hey, Joe!
-How's it going?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.658
Hey, how you do--

08:52.741 --> 08:54.409
Frank, watch your fingers.
You're gonna lose one.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.619
-Hey, Joe.
-Kenny.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.829
I was gonna come check on you.
Why you dragging yourself in here?

08:57.913 --> 08:59.206
I got a check in the office.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.209
You don't think I'm gonna let
you son of a bitches grab it, do ya?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.461
Seriously, Joe.
Do you need a hand or something?

09:04.545 --> 09:07.923
I don't need a hand, Kenny.
I don't need a hand.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.260
-Lance.
-Joe.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.096
Don't worry.
Doc says I'll be back in six weeks.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.390
Don't even think
about hiring a replacement.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.433
Slow down a second, Joe.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.811
You've been out of surgery,
what, three days?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.772
Four days. But I'm getting better.
I'm gonna be better than better.

09:23.856 --> 09:27.818
Look, I was gonna put this in the mail.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.196
But seeing as how you're here...

09:32.739 --> 09:34.616
It's your union contract.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.120
What's that got to do with anything?

09:38.203 --> 09:41.331
Well, your pension plan is in there.
You've been with us for 45 years, Joe.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.583
You're fully vested.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.963
I mean, with social security, you were
practically working for nothing. You know?

09:48.046 --> 09:50.507
What are you talking about, Lance?
You want me to retire?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.677
Got some A-plus benefits in here, Joe.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.930
I'm not gonna retire.
I belong here. This is my shop.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.056
I've been here longer than you.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.767
-I'm the best guy in the place.
-I'm not denying that you were.

10:00.851 --> 10:04.771
What do you mean "were"? I am.
I am getting better every day.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.524
Look, we got a lot of big contracts
coming in right now.

10:07.608 --> 10:11.695
We got restaurants, hotels, and these are
some hard deadlines I gotta meet.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.865
I can't put a man out there
who can't do the work.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.118
We'll see.

10:18.994 --> 10:22.289
You know, look. Come on.
Save yourself the heartache, Joe.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.041
We all know it's time to--

10:24.124 --> 10:25.667
Look, this happens to other people.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.378
-I've seen it.
-I'm not other people. I will be back.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.255
No, you won't.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.301
Look, I'm saying this as a friend.
Okay, Joe?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.220
You're either gonna take
this retirement plan right now

10:36.303 --> 10:39.097
or you're gonna take it in six weeks,
but we both know you're taking it.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.079
I thought you forgot.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.250
No, I had to deal with
something at the shop.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.421
So, how was your day?

11:12.047 --> 11:13.298
Great.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.175
Great. Buckle up.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.886
I hate junior high. It sucks.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.932
You hate junior high?
I'd give anything to be back in school.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.310
-I was captain of the football team...
-So you were popular.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.606
Well, popular?
That's an understatement. I was a legend.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.358
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.735
Night of the senior prom,

11:33.819 --> 11:37.281
I got the football team
to put the principal's car on the roof.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.615
-The roof?
-Yes!

11:38.699 --> 11:40.534
-What?
-Well, not all at once.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.202
You gotta disassemble it and--

11:42.286 --> 11:43.996
Doesn't matter how you got it up there.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.331
At the end of the dance,

11:46.415 --> 11:49.126
everybody came out,
and there we were on the roof.

11:49.209 --> 11:54.590
Football team, Principal Moon's car
and me. Legendary.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.217
They talk about it at every reunion.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.429
So, to become popular,

12:00.512 --> 12:03.724
I gotta become captain of
the football team and put a car on a roof.

12:04.683 --> 12:05.809
Got it.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.230
So, what's the story?
You don't have any friends?

12:10.647 --> 12:13.192
I sorta have one. Brady.

12:13.775 --> 12:18.947
But recently, I don't think he wants
to be around me anymore.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.325
Well, to hell with him then.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.702
Buckle up, please.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.389
Hey, this is for you, Grandpa.

12:45.891 --> 12:48.644
Probably some exercise equipment
from your father.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.396
He goes overboard with that kinda stuff.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.066
It says it's from Wham Comics.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.944
What'd you say?

13:00.489 --> 13:01.490
What is it?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.244
Let's find out.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.755
"Dynoman."

13:17.756 --> 13:22.344
I ordered this when I was a kid.
I don't understand.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.846
Maybe it got lost in the mail.

13:24.763 --> 13:26.098
For 60 years?

13:26.723 --> 13:31.019
I ordered this from the back
of a comic book, and it never came.

13:31.103 --> 13:34.898
I bugged my mother for months
to get my 50 cents back.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.109
Wait. You were into comics too?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.821
Long time ago.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.662
This is nuts. It must be a joke.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.916
Probably Kenny at the shop
is behind this. Yeah.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.836
What did you do with the comics?

13:58.589 --> 14:02.509
I guess I probably gave 'em to your dad.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.930
He never throws anything away.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.684
What's the story of Dynoman?

14:11.351 --> 14:16.607
He was a miner like my dad.
I think that's probably why I liked him.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.443
He was working underground one day,

14:19.526 --> 14:25.741
and a stick of dynamite blew up and shot
three radioactive rocks into his ring.

14:25.824 --> 14:30.370
Each one had a special power.
Strength, speed and flight.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.667
So, like, how do the powers work?

14:37.252 --> 14:38.337
What do you mean?

14:38.420 --> 14:42.216
Like, are they alien rocks
that change his metabolism?

14:42.299 --> 14:43.717
Or is it magic?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.385
Why do you need
an explanation for everything?

14:45.469 --> 14:47.513
Your generation needs
an explanation for everything.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.181
What the hell's the matter with you guys?

14:49.264 --> 14:50.349
Sorry.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.728
So, who's that?

14:54.811 --> 14:58.065
That's the Volt, Dynoman's archenemy.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.902
Dynoman saved Volt's village
in Romania from a meteor.

15:01.985 --> 15:06.114
He smashed it with his ring.
But a chunk of debris destroyed a house,

15:06.198 --> 15:10.035
killing a man and woman inside
while their son played outside.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.871
The boy vowed vengeance on Dynoman.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.249
He found all the remnants of the meteor,

15:15.332 --> 15:19.753
which had absorbed the power
of Dynoman's ring and began to glow.

15:19.837 --> 15:23.590
The Volt saw that glow
and knew he could have that power too.

15:23.674 --> 15:26.343
From those remains, he built his helmet.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.428
So, the hero made the villain.

15:29.847 --> 15:31.139
Pretty standard stuff.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.642
You're right.

15:35.435 --> 15:39.356
Coulda used a twist.
My stories had more panache.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.067
Wait. What do you mean, "your stories"?

15:42.150 --> 15:46.029
Yeah. I wrote a few stories in my day.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.740
Really? That's what I do.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.909
So, why'd you stop?

15:52.411 --> 15:54.830
Can't play with superheroes forever, kid.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.753
-Wait, Grandpa.
-Okay...

16:02.379 --> 16:07.301
It says it comes when you need it, right?
And this came now. Because you need it.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.052
You gotta try it.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.306
You try it. Put it on. See if it fits.

16:13.473 --> 16:17.853
No, it's too big. You gotta try it.
I think it's for you. Come on, for me.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.314
Let me have it.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.360
Holy moly. It fits.

16:25.736 --> 16:26.737
Yeah.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.115
-What is it?
-Nothing.

16:30.199 --> 16:32.701
See? It's a piece of junk. It's a toy.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.414
What?

16:39.041 --> 16:40.501
Wait, wait. Grandpa, Grandpa.

16:40.584 --> 16:44.630
All I'm saying is, toys don't just
magically appear after 60 years.

16:45.631 --> 16:46.965
Try. Hit the bag.

16:48.008 --> 16:51.303
Are you kidding? You don't actually
believe in magic, do ya?

16:51.386 --> 16:54.515
I saw it glow. Isn't that how it works?

16:54.598 --> 16:59.269
Yes. But I got it from a comic book.
This is a chunk of plastic.

16:59.353 --> 17:02.397
And we're gonna do with it
what we should've done a long time ago.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.650
We're gonna throw it in the garbage can.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.984
Son of a bitch, I can't get it off.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.780
-Hey, Grandpa. Please, stop. I... Come on.
-I think my beta-blockers--

17:09.863 --> 17:12.991
-Please.
-Stop it. Quit. Stop it! Please stop.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.617
I know things are crappy right now,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.371
but believing in something stupid
is not the answer.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.624
It's not stupid.

17:22.084 --> 17:26.505
Son of a-- Goddamn it.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.475
Hey. Where are you going?

17:38.976 --> 17:42.145
Dylan? Get cleaned up. It's almost dinner.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.315
Hi.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.736
That doesn't look like Indian food.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.156
Yeah, called an audible.
Figured we'd try something new.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.577
"New" as in "let's give our family
a new species of tapeworm"?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.579
They're burgers. They're fine.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.831
Burgers that were just
the subject of an exposé in the <c.styledotitalic>Times

18:00.914 --> 18:03.959
for putting God knows what in their meat.
Not meat.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.836
They're his favorite, okay?

18:08.505 --> 18:09.590
So that's what this is.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.425
Please, don't analyze me right now.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.552
I hate what he does to you.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.512
What is he--
He's not doing anything to me.

18:15.596 --> 18:17.055
He doesn't even know about dinner.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.724
You're always trying to impress him.

18:19.183 --> 18:23.103
You walk on eggshells so that he doesn't
criticize you, but he always does anyway.

18:23.187 --> 18:25.606
And then you feel bad. Like right now.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.857
You didn't get Indian food

18:26.940 --> 18:28.567
because you were worried
your dad would go on some rant

18:28.650 --> 18:32.196
about how we think we're too good
for regular old American food.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.156
I'm just protective of you.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.117
We're doing a lot for your dad,
and he doesn't even seem to be grateful.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.536
You watch.
This gesture will go a long way. Yeah?

18:39.620 --> 18:41.705
He might-- He might even say thank you.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.166
I would eat those burgers
every night for a month

18:44.249 --> 18:45.834
if your father ever says thank you.

18:50.923 --> 18:53.467
-Where's Dylan?
-He wanted to eat in the living room.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.427
Bryce, can you stop with the ball?
We're eating now, please.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.679
Coach said I have to keep my hands
on it at all times.

18:57.763 --> 18:59.473
I'm pretty sure he meant figuratively.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.227
Nice bling, Grandpa.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.772
This is nothing.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.946
Hey, Dad, before I forget,
guess who called me today.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.031
-Who?
-Lance.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.283
They were talking about
how much they appreciate the work

19:18.367 --> 19:20.744
you've done over the years for them.
And apparently, to honor that,

19:20.827 --> 19:23.539
they've offered you
a pretty generous retirement package?

19:24.289 --> 19:27.084
Fine. I'll take it in 20 years.

19:28.752 --> 19:29.753
Well, okay.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.130
I think you might wanna think
about it a little sooner.

19:33.757 --> 19:34.758
What are you saying?

19:36.051 --> 19:39.680
Nothing. I'm just, you know, you've put
your time in there for, what, 45 years?

19:39.763 --> 19:40.931
Paid your dues.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.516
You don't think I can get back, do you?

19:42.599 --> 19:43.725
No, I'm not saying that.

19:44.226 --> 19:49.231
Wow. What a payoff
for a father who believed in you.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.315
Okay.

19:50.399 --> 19:51.692
Did you?

19:52.609 --> 19:55.737
Didn't you call medical school
a boot camp for know-it-alls?

19:55.821 --> 19:58.031
It is. That's where you two met, isn't it?

19:58.115 --> 20:01.159
Hey, Dylan. Why don't you come in here
and sit with us for a little bit?

20:01.243 --> 20:04.162
Joe, Mike's just looking out for you.
And he trusts Lance.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.873
Lance has been running point

20:05.956 --> 20:08.500
on the ins and outs of all the new jobs
that are coming in.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.752
If he's worried about you being there,

20:10.836 --> 20:13.380
we're not just gonna let you go
back to work, because you...

20:13.463 --> 20:14.590
Let me?

20:15.257 --> 20:17.342
Yeah. Frankly, at your age--

20:17.426 --> 20:21.722
My age? You are not far behind me.
Don't forget that.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.891
Dad. Stop. Take a breath.

20:23.974 --> 20:27.895
We're just trying to get you
to think realistically about your future.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.522
I'm the reason we get those big orders.

20:30.606 --> 20:33.025
I am the one responsible
for all those contracts.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.151
-I'm the reason--
-Grandpa, look.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.652
we ship all that furniture
out of the state.

20:35.736 --> 20:36.737
And now Lance is.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.405
-I built it with my own hands.
-Grandpa, the ring.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.449
I have been building it all my life.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.743
-Maybe that life is over.
-Bryce, the ball.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.996
My life is not over!

20:57.257 --> 20:59.134
There has got to be an explanation.

20:59.510 --> 21:02.221
Yeah, that it's real. You saw it glowing.

21:02.888 --> 21:06.016
Kid, this rock's as dull
as your dad's sense of humor.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.018
Yeah, now. But before?

21:08.101 --> 21:11.522
Don't you feel different?
Strong? Anything?

21:12.940 --> 21:15.234
Come on, just try. Smash it.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.610
Nah.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.529
Come on. You said it yourself.

21:18.946 --> 21:21.740
Dynoman's powers only came to him
whenever he needed them.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.868
And you clearly needed it because
you were pissed off at Mom and Dad.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.496
-It was your anger.
-Nah, it'd be insane.

21:27.579 --> 21:31.792
Is it? Or are you just too afraid
to see if you're strong?

21:32.584 --> 21:35.838
I guess he is smarter than you, 'cause
you barely made it out of high school,

21:35.921 --> 21:37.923
and he made it all the way
to medical school.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.092
You're basically uneducated--

21:43.929 --> 21:46.139
Son of a bitch.

21:46.974 --> 21:47.975
I was right.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.395
You're right.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.440
You're a superhero, Grandpa.
Oh, my-- You really are!

21:56.775 --> 21:58.151
Hot damn!

22:01.947 --> 22:02.948
Mother of God.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.284
And the knee?

22:24.469 --> 22:25.470
Cool.

22:30.017 --> 22:31.643
Remember, guys.
This is black walnut.

22:31.727 --> 22:33.770
You bend your knees,
you watch your backs, okay?

22:33.854 --> 22:35.564
Kenny, this needs to go out by Tuesday.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.648
Copy.

22:36.732 --> 22:40.485
Joe. Hey, listen. I'm glad your family
talked some sense into you.

22:40.569 --> 22:41.778
Wait. No. You can't do that, Joe.

22:41.862 --> 22:43.822
-You need a full doctor's--
-What are you doing?

22:43.906 --> 22:45.616
That's a liability.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.910
Shall I clock in, Lance?

22:47.993 --> 22:48.994
What the...

22:54.416 --> 22:57.961
Hey, Brady. Brady. I found something
so cool. You're never gonna believe this.

22:58.045 --> 22:59.546
Can we... talk about this later?

22:59.630 --> 23:01.006
Okay.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.299
Is that him?

23:03.050 --> 23:04.384
It's me?

23:05.052 --> 23:06.053
What?

23:06.136 --> 23:07.679
-I can explain.
-Hey, Batman.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.015
My dad's being
a real bitch about my curfew.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.434
Could you and Robin
go kick his ass for me?

23:14.102 --> 23:16.563
Jesse. Be nice.
He's just playing dress-up.

23:17.064 --> 23:20.484
Dress-up Dylan.
It has a nice ring to it. Huh? Huh?

23:24.321 --> 23:25.447
Hey, where are you going?

23:25.531 --> 23:28.825
We can have a party. A costume party.
You can be Wonder Woman.

23:30.118 --> 23:34.581
Dylan, hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:34.665 --> 23:37.876
Me and some other people,
we were just hanging out the other day,

23:37.960 --> 23:39.628
and I took a group selfie.

23:39.711 --> 23:40.838
And I was about to post it

23:40.921 --> 23:46.593
when they saw my photo stream
and the photo you sent to me.

23:46.677 --> 23:48.220
Of me in the costume.

23:49.054 --> 23:53.934
Yeah. I told them you were
an old friend who likes to--

23:54.017 --> 23:55.143
To dress up.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.312
-They thought it was funny.
-No kidding!

23:57.938 --> 24:00.107
-Dylan, I...
-Why didn't you stop them?

24:00.190 --> 24:01.400
Why didn't you say, like,

24:01.483 --> 24:04.987
how last year you dressed up as Venom
and thought it was cool?

24:05.988 --> 24:07.197
You were laughing at me.

24:08.991 --> 24:10.284
-Dude.
-Just go.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.537
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.506
-Concept. Yeah, yeah.
-<c.styledotitalic>Hola.

24:24.590 --> 24:25.757
Hey, Dad.

24:25.841 --> 24:28.552
By the way, did something happen with
your physical therapist in the garage?

24:28.635 --> 24:30.304
The work bench is all shattered.

24:31.471 --> 24:34.349
Yes. She put some weights on it.
It collapsed.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.393
Shoddy construction.
Let me tell you about that.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.979
Really? How you feeling today?

24:39.980 --> 24:41.440
Actually, fantastic.

24:41.982 --> 24:44.651
Fantastic.
That's a big leap from yesterday. Good.

24:44.735 --> 24:48.155
I've just come from the doctor's.
He gave me a complete release.

24:48.655 --> 24:49.489
What?

24:50.240 --> 24:52.868
Maybe you'll think twice
about doubting me again.

24:53.493 --> 24:56.163
I go back to work tomorrow.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.082
What? But that's not possible.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.459
And yet it is.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.754
And what's better,
I will be out of your hair in...

25:04.922 --> 25:06.757
six days, never mind six weeks.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.841
Where's Dylan?

25:08.842 --> 25:10.302
In his room. In your room.

25:12.054 --> 25:13.305
Over there.

25:13.388 --> 25:17.059
Dylan, man, you should've been there.
I'm sorry you didn't see it.

25:18.101 --> 25:21.396
What's going on with you? You--
Why you got such a long face?

25:21.813 --> 25:22.814
I'm toxic.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.441
"Toxic"?

25:25.192 --> 25:26.193
Look.

25:28.529 --> 25:29.530
Who is this?

25:29.613 --> 25:30.822
Just look.

25:33.784 --> 25:36.745
They're calling you Dress-up Dylan.
I see that. Okay.

25:37.412 --> 25:41.542
Dylan, if I could get this ring off,
I would give it to you.

25:41.625 --> 25:44.878
You could kick the crap out of that guy.
But I can't get it off.

25:44.962 --> 25:47.589
But if there's anything else
I could do to help you, I would.

25:48.173 --> 25:51.593
Actually... maybe there is.

25:51.677 --> 25:52.803
What?

25:52.886 --> 25:56.849
Let's put the principal's car on the roof.
You can get it up there. Easy.

25:56.932 --> 25:59.142
And I'll stand by it, take credit for it.

25:59.226 --> 26:03.272
Look. When I was a kid,
we did not put the car on the roof.

26:03.355 --> 26:06.358
We lifted it up and took it down
the block a little bit.

26:06.441 --> 26:10.195
The principal was surprised.
I exaggerated, honestly.

26:10.279 --> 26:15.242
We could do it now.
I'll be, like, a total legend.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.452
No one will know how I did it.

26:18.495 --> 26:21.874
I don't think you really need to worry
about those kids in school.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.711
They're losers.
They're gonna grow up to be losers, too.

26:26.336 --> 26:29.006
You wanna go trick-or-treating,
you go trick-or-treating.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.592
You know, go on out there.
Get yourself some candy.

26:31.675 --> 26:33.385
It's not really the same.

26:35.012 --> 26:36.430
No, I guess it isn't.

26:37.514 --> 26:38.724
All right, look.

26:38.807 --> 26:42.686
I know when I get down,
I don't wanna have anybody near me,

26:42.769 --> 26:45.355
so I'm gonna leave you alone.

26:45.439 --> 26:46.440
Wait.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.817
You're right.

26:49.318 --> 26:50.319
I am?

26:50.652 --> 26:54.781
Yeah. I don't need Brady, or any of them.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.159
-No.
-I could go have the best Halloween ever.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.577
Yes, that's the spirit.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.786
With you.

27:01.038 --> 27:03.916
Let's go trick-or-treating.
It'll be awesome. It'll be so much fun.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.752
You get off at work at 5:00. Right?

27:09.171 --> 27:10.172
All right.

27:11.548 --> 27:16.178
Five o'clock. Trick-or-treating.
You and me. Don't be late.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.689
Jeez, Joe.
I guess I should've asked you for help.

27:27.773 --> 27:28.774
Damn right.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.289
I'm taking an early lunch, Lance.

28:31.461 --> 28:33.714
Good-lookin' map you got there, kiddo.

28:33.797 --> 28:34.923
What are you doing here?

28:36.175 --> 28:39.845
I just took a little lunch break.
Thought I'd come say hello.

28:41.930 --> 28:44.349
-Guess how I got here.
-How?

28:45.517 --> 28:46.518
I ran.

28:46.602 --> 28:47.686
No way!

28:47.769 --> 28:49.354
-Yep.
-Speed, the second stone?

28:49.855 --> 28:51.148
-Damn right.
-Okay.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.358
So, Fox Point and Shorewood
have the best candy.

28:53.442 --> 28:54.443
Yeah.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.236
The East Side and Whitefish Bay
are second.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.321
Yeah.

28:57.404 --> 29:01.617
Usually, me and Brady have time for one,
maybe two. But with your speed...

29:01.992 --> 29:03.577
We'll get all four tonight.

29:04.203 --> 29:07.748
Bring a big bag. We're gonna keep
your dentist busy for years.

29:07.831 --> 29:08.916
Oh, yeah.

29:20.385 --> 29:23.680
Soon as I called, you said,
"Sure, 150 tables. Those will be done."

29:23.764 --> 29:26.350
-Yes.
-But now you don't have my 150 tables.

29:26.433 --> 29:27.434
Hey, Joe.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.437
-How we doing, Kenny?
-Doing okay.

29:30.896 --> 29:34.233
What's Lance all in a tizzy
about over there?

29:34.316 --> 29:36.860
Customer's pissed. She's got
a restaurant opening in two days,

29:36.944 --> 29:39.154
and we were supposed to have
all their tables ready by tomorrow.

29:39.238 --> 29:40.447
It's gonna be another week.

29:40.989 --> 29:44.826
Well, always happens. You oughta be
more straight with the customer.

29:44.910 --> 29:47.621
Oh, he's just trying to keep her business.
She's the regional manager.

29:47.704 --> 29:48.705
It's a big chain.

29:48.789 --> 29:50.666
So now I expect them tomorrow.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.584
I understand, yes. I'm very sorry.

29:52.668 --> 29:54.753
-We just need-- We need--
-Till tomorrow.

29:55.754 --> 29:59.007
Your tables and chairs
will be ready tomorrow, guaranteed.

29:59.758 --> 30:02.427
And we'll throw in a handmade sign. Free.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.097
-Handmade sign.
-Yep.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.181
You better.

30:10.644 --> 30:12.229
Joe, what are you doing?

30:12.312 --> 30:15.315
Don't worry about a thing, Lance.
I got this covered.

30:16.275 --> 30:18.110
Okay. You...

30:18.694 --> 30:21.780
You got this covered. Okay.

31:37.356 --> 31:38.857
Please don't say, "I told you so."

31:39.858 --> 31:42.819
I don't have to say anything.
The look on our son's face says it all.

31:43.362 --> 31:46.448
Nothing you can say about your dad
right now makes that look okay.

31:50.619 --> 31:51.620
You're right.

31:57.960 --> 31:58.961
Not here yet, huh?

32:03.590 --> 32:05.217
What's going on with you and Grandpa?

32:06.426 --> 32:08.178
Nothing. What?

32:08.262 --> 32:12.015
It just seems like both of you have been
acting a little different lately.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.062
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

32:17.771 --> 32:20.274
Try me. Do you know where he is right now?

32:22.651 --> 32:25.654
Dylan? Come on, honey. You can tell me.

32:28.574 --> 32:30.826
Probably having fun with his superpowers.

32:30.909 --> 32:32.452
His what?

32:32.536 --> 32:33.954
Do you know Dynoman?

32:36.874 --> 32:38.041
You mean, like, the comic?

32:40.419 --> 32:44.339
Yeah. Grandpa used to try to get me
into that when I was a kid.

32:44.423 --> 32:49.511
Well, I like it. But...

32:49.928 --> 32:53.265
Dylan, trust me. Whatever it is, I've been
in the same boat with Grandpa Joe.

32:57.102 --> 32:59.938
So, okay.

33:01.315 --> 33:02.482
There's this ring...

33:06.486 --> 33:08.530
-Hey, did you see the look on his face?
-Wow.

33:08.614 --> 33:10.449
I think you're gonna send him
to an early retirement.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.533
-Okay.
-Be a good idea.

33:11.617 --> 33:14.036
We'll get a guy in here
with managerial experience.

33:14.119 --> 33:15.287
I was gonna tell you guys.

33:15.370 --> 33:17.915
You're all getting a big fat
"you're fired" is what's happening.

33:17.998 --> 33:19.124
Yeah.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.460
Dad, what the hell are you doing?

33:22.294 --> 33:26.340
Hey, fellas. Maybe,
let's grab another round at the bar.

33:31.887 --> 33:34.473
-You've gotta be kidding me right now.
-Mike, I'm sorry.

33:34.556 --> 33:37.684
And not only did you stand him up,
he thinks you're a superhero?

33:38.393 --> 33:40.062
He's not just a boy
looking up to his grandpa.

33:40.145 --> 33:41.980
He thinks you're
an actual superhero with powers.

33:42.064 --> 33:44.566
-I will go home and explain things.
-No, you're not. Trust me.

33:44.650 --> 33:45.651
You can explain things to me,

33:45.734 --> 33:47.694
like why you're filling his head
with this Dynoman crap anyway.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.279
Dynoman. It's my favorite comic book.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.073
-Don't you remember?
-I know what it is, Dad.

33:51.156 --> 33:52.199
-I tried to give it to you...
-Yeah.

33:52.282 --> 33:55.369
...like I tried to give you all
the things I love, all the stuff I loved.

33:55.452 --> 33:58.830
Dad, you think I wanted stuff?
I wanted you.

34:00.541 --> 34:01.959
And that's what Dylan wants.

34:02.459 --> 34:05.128
And you're screwing that up with him
the way you screwed it up with me.

34:05.212 --> 34:07.923
He's learning what I learned
a long time ago this very moment:

34:08.005 --> 34:09.466
that all you ever really care about
is you,

34:09.550 --> 34:12.386
-your shop, your interests, your friends.
-Me?

34:12.469 --> 34:16.473
This is my work. I love this place.
And not only that, but I worked today.

34:16.556 --> 34:17.933
-I made all those tables.
-Stop.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.935
You see those tables? We made them today.

34:20.018 --> 34:22.521
-We were backed up. I lost track of time.
-Just stop. Dad.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.856
Just stop, Dad.

34:24.857 --> 34:26.149
It was always something.

34:26.817 --> 34:28.735
An order came in. Another shift came up.

34:28.819 --> 34:30.487
Anything so you wouldn't have
to have dinner with us.

34:30.571 --> 34:34.241
I worked for you.
I worked for your mother and you.

34:34.324 --> 34:35.576
No.

34:35.659 --> 34:38.954
You tell yourself that so you can sleep
at night. But it was always about you.

34:39.036 --> 34:42.791
For whatever reason, whatever you needed,
you couldn't get from me, or Mom.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.670
You know what the thing is, I actually
thought this time was gonna be different.

34:46.753 --> 34:48.547
I thought maybe, finally you could change.

34:48.630 --> 34:50.924
I actually thought
the injury could be a good thing.

34:51.007 --> 34:52.592
But you know
what the interesting thing is?

34:52.676 --> 34:55.804
The minute that your job was threatened,
suddenly your knee fixes itself.

34:55.888 --> 34:57.556
That's very convenient, Dad.

34:57.639 --> 34:58.640
Where is Dylan now?

34:58.724 --> 35:00.392
Dylan's in his room crying his eyes out

35:00.475 --> 35:03.812
that the one guy who he thought
was on his team isn't.

35:05.063 --> 35:06.773
The one guy who said he wasn't a loser

35:06.857 --> 35:10.110
decides he'd rather show off for some
friends at work that don't need him

35:10.819 --> 35:13.030
than keep his word to a grandson who does.

35:14.990 --> 35:16.742
I can fix this, Mike.

35:16.825 --> 35:19.620
No, this isn't patching up
some dining room table.

35:19.703 --> 35:21.496
It's way too late to fix.

35:23.123 --> 35:26.126
You've been wanting to leave our house
from the minute you got there.

35:26.210 --> 35:27.419
Now you're gonna get your wish.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.671
I want you to go home,
get your stuff and leave.

36:01.495 --> 36:02.496
Ow.

36:32.943 --> 36:34.194
<c.styledotitalic>Who's that?

36:34.278 --> 36:37.990
<c.styledotitalic>That's the Volt, Dynoman's archenemy.

36:38.073 --> 36:41.535
<c.styledotitalic>Dynoman saved Volt's village
in Romania from a meteor.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.537
<c.styledotitalic>He smashed it with his ring...

36:46.540 --> 36:50.919
<c.styledotitalic>which had absorbed the power
of Dynoman's ring and began to glow.

36:54.631 --> 36:58.886
<c.styledotitalic>The Volt saw that glow
and knew he could have that power too.

36:58.969 --> 37:02.097
<c.styledotitalic>From those remains, he built his helmet.

37:49.228 --> 37:50.896
Happy Halloween.

37:50.979 --> 37:53.190
-Thanks so much.
-Thank you. Yeah, happy Halloween.

37:56.193 --> 37:59.863
-What happened?
-What do you think happened? Nothing.

37:59.947 --> 38:03.116
He doesn't get it. And I'm done trying
to make him care about his family.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.078
If he wants to push everyone away
and end up alone, that's his problem.

38:06.161 --> 38:07.287
I'm sorry. I just--

38:12.125 --> 38:13.877
I'm gonna go tell Dylan he can
have his room back.

38:13.961 --> 38:16.296
I'll be very surprised if Dad
even comes home tonight.

38:17.923 --> 38:19.091
I wouldn't be so sure.

38:31.645 --> 38:34.147
Dylan! Dylan!

39:05.804 --> 39:07.723
-Damn it, Dylan!
-Where is he?

39:08.223 --> 39:09.474
Hi, Mr. Harris.

39:09.558 --> 39:10.809
Sorry, Grandpa.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.227
Your brother, where is he?

39:12.311 --> 39:14.271
I don't know.
I think there's a dance tonight.

39:14.646 --> 39:16.064
We saw him leave in his costume.

39:16.148 --> 39:19.443
He said tonight was gonna be legendary.
Whatever that means.

39:19.526 --> 39:22.446
"Legendary." Oh, no.

39:24.114 --> 39:25.407
Hey, Grandpa. Close the door.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.083
Let's go, guys.

39:36.877 --> 39:38.170
You look great.

40:10.786 --> 40:11.995
Dad, we need to talk.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.575
Come on. Come on. Come on.

40:59.126 --> 41:01.128
Okay. Okay.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.410
No, no, no.

41:42.586 --> 41:43.921
No, no.

41:54.348 --> 41:56.391
Oh, no. Oh, no.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.231
Come on.

42:03.815 --> 42:04.816
Crap!

42:18.330 --> 42:20.290
Holy moly! Kid!

42:20.874 --> 42:21.875
Okay.

42:26.088 --> 42:27.339
Oh, God. Oh, God.

42:30.509 --> 42:31.927
Oh, God. I'm coming, kid.

42:33.929 --> 42:36.473
-Dylan!
-Grandpa! Grandpa! Help!

42:37.307 --> 42:39.518
-Grandpa. Push the car up.
-Oh, Dylan. No.

42:39.601 --> 42:41.186
No, no. I got no more powers.

42:41.270 --> 42:42.729
-What?
-I have no powers left.

42:42.813 --> 42:44.523
Okay. Just stay forward.

42:44.606 --> 42:46.233
-Stay forward. Okay.
-Okay.

42:46.316 --> 42:48.402
Grab hold of the wheel.
Come toward me, real easy.

42:48.485 --> 42:52.531
Don't make any sudden move-- No, no, no.
Wait. Let me grab my-- Grab my hand.

42:54.449 --> 42:55.534
No! No!

42:55.617 --> 42:57.411
-I'm so sorry, Dylan!
-No, Grandpa!

42:58.912 --> 42:59.997
No, no!

43:09.631 --> 43:11.091
-Mike.
-Dad!

43:11.175 --> 43:12.384
I got ya. Hold on.

43:12.467 --> 43:14.553
Mike. How you doing that?

43:20.309 --> 43:21.310
What?

43:26.899 --> 43:27.900
It's incredible.

43:30.903 --> 43:32.112
It is.

43:36.783 --> 43:38.827
-Dad, Dylan?
-Dad.

43:38.911 --> 43:41.788
-That was...
-Slow, slow. It's okay. You're okay.

43:41.872 --> 43:43.624
Holy mackerel, Mike.

43:44.541 --> 43:46.084
You're okay. I got ya.

43:48.378 --> 43:49.588
That's scary, Mike.

43:52.925 --> 43:57.054
Oh, my God. Did you--
I just-- And then I--

43:57.137 --> 43:59.097
-That was awesome!
-That was awesome.

43:59.181 --> 44:01.683
I held a car, Dad. I held a car.

44:01.767 --> 44:03.810
-How'd you do it, Mike?
-I don't know. It just happened.

44:03.894 --> 44:06.396
I was in the garage.
I was looking for you. You weren't there.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.483
I saw the ring on the ground,
and then it just took over.

44:18.367 --> 44:19.409
They're gonna catch us.

44:19.493 --> 44:22.162
No. They're not. Come here.

44:24.957 --> 44:26.333
-You ready?
-Yeah.

44:26.416 --> 44:29.294
One, two, three!

44:47.271 --> 44:48.814
Is that my car?

44:49.439 --> 44:51.859
Yep. It is!

44:57.906 --> 45:00.534
So, that's it? We're just gonna bury it?

45:01.159 --> 45:06.665
Well, it's like Dynoman said,
"It only comes when you need it," kiddo.

45:07.499 --> 45:09.585
And I don't need it anymore.

45:10.252 --> 45:11.253
None of us do.

45:14.715 --> 45:16.425
You know, I was thinking, kid.

45:16.508 --> 45:22.931
Why be the next Neal Adams
when you can be the only Dylan Harris?

45:23.599 --> 45:25.893
We ought to make our own superhero.

45:26.310 --> 45:27.644
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

45:29.104 --> 45:31.064
I was thinking of some ideas.

45:32.316 --> 45:33.317
I can draw them.

45:34.109 --> 45:35.319
That's what I was thinking.

45:37.696 --> 45:39.740
-How we doing, Dad?
-I think we're good.

45:39.823 --> 45:41.033
There we go.

45:41.116 --> 45:44.328
Hey, maybe the kryptonite
for that superhero could be Jolly Burger.

45:44.411 --> 45:46.121
I'm still feeling that
from the other night.

45:46.205 --> 45:47.831
I don't know how you eat that stuff.

45:49.082 --> 45:51.460
What do gastroenterologists say
about that?

45:51.543 --> 45:53.086
That should be the superpower.

45:53.170 --> 45:54.254
Yeah!

45:54.338 --> 45:55.339
Yeah!

45:56.507 --> 45:58.091
Gastroenterology Man.
