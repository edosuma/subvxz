01:04.063 --> 01:05.622
Get her out.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.630
- No!
- God damn it!

01:28.671 --> 01:30.230
Shift!

01:39.682 --> 01:43.285
Hold her down!
Hold her down! Relax! Relax.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.747
Hold, relax, relax, relax, relax.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.488
- Morning, partner.
- Hey.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.349
When did they call it in?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.851
About three hours ago.

04:29.852 --> 04:33.413
A couple of joggers found her
after the tide went out.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.650
Watch your step here,
it's a bit dicey.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.461
Victim is Caucasian
female, mid-20's

04:40.029 --> 04:41.154
suffered severe trauma

04:41.155 --> 04:43.575
from apparently falling off this
structure right over here.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.302
I've also got a partial ID.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.597
Found a British passport that
lists her as a Samantha Walker

04:51.291 --> 04:55.602
and a driver's license that shows
a local address in Hollywood.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.733
Why only partial?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.553
She was out here for
most of the night.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.447
Seems like maybe the local
wildlife took a run at her.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.368
See if you can find someone
to confirm the identity.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.857
Track down the next of kin.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.376
If she's got a visa,
State's got a record.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.112
So, send a black and
white to the residence,

05:22.113 --> 05:25.257
talk to the landlord, neighbors,
anybody who maybe knew her.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.175
All right.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.513
Sheriff report a car, abandoned car,
missing car somewhere?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.850
No, not that I'm aware of.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.379
Yep, she didn't get
here on her own.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.089
- A long way from Hollywood.
- Yep.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.358
- Someone saw her.
- Copy that.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.528
Walker, the man needs to see you.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.414
You wanted to see me, sir.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.918
Give us a minute.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.285
You are aware that all voice
and e-mail communications

06:52.286 --> 06:56.223
sent to and from this base are monitored
under standard security protocols?

06:56.707 --> 06:58.099
Well, of course, yeah.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.854
We received this yesterday
while you were on patrol.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.278
I'm sorry, Walker, there is
no easy way to say this.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.098
Your daughter was found dead
after an apparent drug overdose

07:13.099 --> 07:15.617
earlier this week in Los Angeles.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.982
This can't be right.
This can't be right.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.818
It's a mistake, you're gonna
have to double-check this.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.028
The body is actually still there.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.864
They'll need you to sign off on it

07:28.865 --> 07:32.217
before it can be shipped
back to London for burial.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.768
I'm gonna have to get the
next chopper out of here.

07:42.044 --> 07:44.771
Yeah, well, it's not
as simple as that.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.426
Look, I know this is hard
for you to understand,

07:49.427 --> 07:52.179
but when you signed your contract
extension with Everest last March,

07:52.180 --> 07:53.889
you gave up certain liberties

07:53.890 --> 07:56.825
that government military
personnel are allowed.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.227
You can't be serious.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.980
We've been tasked with
a major staging operation

08:01.981 --> 08:05.108
in coordination with the arrival
of a senator from the States.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.736
We'll need you for
full tactical support.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.421
We're talking about
my daughter here.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.840
And you are a team
leader at Everest.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.015
What the fuck has that
got to do with anything?

08:16.078 --> 08:18.497
Risk versus reward.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.540
When we brought you in
from the British military,

08:20.541 --> 08:23.226
you were making less
than Â£30,000 a year.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.855
At Everest, you're making
more than four times that.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.800
Now you listen to me,
you walk away from this,

08:30.801 --> 08:32.802
you'll be abandoning
your operational post.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.780
No contractor in the
world would touch you.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.366
Yeah?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.413
Well, fuck you and yours.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.259
Anyone there?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.928
Hold on a minute, mate.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.978
What the hell are you doing here?

10:30.254 --> 10:32.105
I thought you were still abroad.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.734
Yeah, well, things didn't
quite go as planned.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.487
Fancy a drink? I think I still
got whiskey down here.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.909
Yeah, I'll come down.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.876
Listen, Nick, I just
want to say thanks.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.570
I appreciate you looking
after the place.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.173
Just wish it were under
better circumstances.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.341
Yeah.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.817
You know, it's funny...

11:19.387 --> 11:20.695
We used to collect these

11:22.390 --> 11:25.033
from restaurants all over the world

11:25.935 --> 11:28.244
whenever we were on holiday.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.875
Melissa thought we'd
settle in this place.

11:34.735 --> 11:39.280
That we would build a life together
having these dinner parties

11:39.281 --> 11:41.616
with plates from all
over the world.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.176
I think it made me laugh.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.972
And it was a very good
conversation piece.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.604
And then after Sam was born...

11:55.297 --> 11:58.608
The only time we got to
travel abroad was when...

11:58.801 --> 12:00.360
Was when I got new orders.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.112
Grounded on the base...

12:04.306 --> 12:06.199
No way to raise a kid.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.997
When was the last time
you heard from her?

12:16.360 --> 12:17.836
Months ago.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.548
I mean, after her mom died...

12:22.241 --> 12:24.884
Things kind of drifted.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.722
One month led to another month
and then before you know it,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.308
we lost contact.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.397
I forget...

12:37.840 --> 12:41.651
I forget how hard it was for
her growing up in Los Angeles.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.281
I should have been there for her.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.951
I should have been a better
dad, made the effort.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.664
Surprised you got back so early.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.959
They give you any problems when
you asked for the time off?

12:58.861 --> 13:01.379
Only for the fact because I told
them to go fuck themselves.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.631
That's classy.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.116
No matter where you seem to go,

13:05.117 --> 13:08.386
there's more than likely a bridge
that's gonna get burned down.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.790
I don't know how you made it in the
military for as long as you did.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.642
Well, they kept me on the
front line for a reason.

13:17.046 --> 13:20.106
But I'm done with it now,
I've had enough.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.443
Twenty five years in service.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.155
Time to try something new.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.574
Any ideas?

13:32.019 --> 13:35.163
No, not yet. But I'm working on it.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.670
Look, Nick, I don't want to put
it on you, but I need your help.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.825
I need you to sort some stuff
out for me. I need to...

13:46.826 --> 13:49.260
I need to get rid of this house.

13:49.662 --> 13:54.182
The only things that are left here now
are just memories I'd rather forget.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.353
In this market, you're not gonna
get what it used to be worth.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.338
That don't matter.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.483
There's enough in this to at
least get me started again.

14:03.759 --> 14:07.320
I'll make some calls when you
head over to the States.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.741
I'm not with you, what do you
mean, back to the States?

14:12.059 --> 14:13.868
When you fly back to the States.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.537
I'm not going anywhere, mate.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.613
You don't know, do you?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.298
Don't know what?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.510
Her body's still in Los Angeles.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.894
Please tell me that you
are fucking kidding me.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.191
They were supposed to
bring her home tomorrow.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.487
After you contacted us,
I thought you would have heard.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.574
No, because they cut all
communication when I left the base.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.912
Fucking hell.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.649
You got your phone on you?

15:01.650 --> 15:02.734
Back at the house.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.415
I'm gonna need you to
go and get it for me.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.188
I'm gonna phone the airlines and
get a direct flight out of here.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.158
That's been here the whole time?

15:10.159 --> 15:13.369
Well, it ain't much, but it's
better than putting it in the bank.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.595
Give me five minutes.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.604
Listen, I apologize,
Mr. Walker, for the delay.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.332
It's been a bit slow
down here today.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.506
Please don't worry, I understand.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.299
Go ahead.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.605
What is this, some sort of a joke?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.468
That's not my daughter,
that's not Sam.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.762
I understand this can be
difficult, Mr. Walker.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.347
Please, just take your time.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.308
I'm telling you, you're
not listening to me.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.369
This is not my daughter.
It's not Sam.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.707
Just give me a second, hold on,
let me check on this real quick.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.880
This... This has got
to be some mistake.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.032
How was she originally identified?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.218
We just brought her in
under standard procedures.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.435
Mr. Walker?

19:14.111 --> 19:17.713
Hi, this is Cathy, I'm not around,
but I will call you back.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.504
Welcome to the offices
of Most Industries.

19:33.505 --> 19:38.276
Our office hours are between 10:00 a.m.
and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.622
Welcome to the offices
of Most Industries.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.541
Our office hours are
between 10:00 a. m....

21:51.226 --> 21:54.370
Good morning, Most Industries.
How may I direct your call?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.664
Samantha Walker, please.

21:57.065 --> 22:00.167
I'm sorry, can you please
hold for one moment?

22:04.406 --> 22:06.991
I thank you for holding,
how may I direct your call?

22:06.992 --> 22:09.301
Yeah, I need to talk
to a Samantha Walker.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.746
Can I have your name, please?

22:11.747 --> 22:14.390
Is there a Samantha Walker
in your department?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.560
Miss Walker no longer works for us.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.522
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.425
I need your address, please,
of your corporate offices.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.845
We're at 11579,
Fulton in Century City.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.447
What's this in regards to?

23:07.010 --> 23:08.260
God morning, how you doing?

23:08.261 --> 23:09.845
Good morning.

23:09.846 --> 23:12.266
I have an appointment scheduled
with Most Industries today.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.269
Karl Schuuster?

23:17.270 --> 23:19.480
Yeah, yeah, that's
exactly who it is.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.040
I haven't seen him come by yet.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.441
Well, I like to be early
for these types of things.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.484
You know what it's like.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.986
You know what they say, early
bird gets the worm and all that.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.446
Just sign in there for me, please.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.797
Yep.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.535
You can take the
elevator, 11th floor.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.303
Appreciate it, thanks.

23:49.052 --> 23:50.778
Most Industries.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.724
One moment, please. Can I help you?

23:55.725 --> 23:56.809
Hi, yeah, good morning.

23:56.810 --> 24:00.579
Uh, I'm here to inquire about
my daughter, Samantha Walker.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.414
Do you recognize her?

24:02.482 --> 24:05.793
Sorry, Most Industries,
how may I direct your call?

24:05.944 --> 24:08.154
You're the girl
I spoke with earlier.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.613
One moment, please.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.450
I'm sorry, Mr. Schuuster isn't
meant to be in the office today,

24:12.451 --> 24:15.744
but if you'd like to leave your number,
I'll be glad to let him now you stopped by.

24:15.745 --> 24:16.971
Well, thanks very much.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.456
Is that his office?

24:18.457 --> 24:20.666
- No, sir, you can't go up there.
- Is that his office?

24:20.667 --> 24:23.878
Sir... Excuse me, sir!
Sir, you can't go up there!

24:23.879 --> 24:26.772
Sir! You can't just run upstairs!

24:28.633 --> 24:31.677
So I need all those numbers in place.
You guys cross-check, okay?

24:31.678 --> 24:33.471
- You can't go up there!
- What the hell is this?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.447
Sir, excuse me, sir!

24:35.682 --> 24:37.992
Oh, my God. Excuse me.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.311
I'm so sorry, sir.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.938
That's okay, honey. Thanks,
Marissa, it'll be all right.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.331
You're Karl Schuuster?

24:44.649 --> 24:47.209
Uh, yeah, yes, I am.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.055
Um, you got me at a
little disadvantage here.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.865
My name's Lex Walker.

24:52.866 --> 24:57.077
I don't know what's going on here, but let
me just start off with a little apology.

24:57.078 --> 25:01.265
See, I got a terribly hectic schedule
today, I'm gonna be tied up.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.752
In the interest of
speeding things up,

25:04.753 --> 25:06.712
what can I do for you?
What are you here for?

25:06.713 --> 25:09.356
You knew my daughter,
Samantha Walker?

25:10.258 --> 25:12.259
Hmm... Is that right?

25:12.260 --> 25:14.361
Yeah, she worked for you.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.031
Well, for at least
this company anyway.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.350
Well, I understand why
you'd think that,

25:19.351 --> 25:23.270
but something you should know is
that I have hundreds of employees

25:23.271 --> 25:27.441
and I guess a pretty large
portion of them I've never met,

25:27.442 --> 25:29.835
and I'm afraid your
daughter is one of them.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.031
Well, gentlemen, you can
leave now. Thank you.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.159
Uh, do me a favor, Saphire should be
sitting right outside that office.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.285
Would you ask him to come in

25:38.286 --> 25:41.221
and show this gentleman down
to human resources, thanks.

25:42.582 --> 25:46.060
And now, Mister, uh, Walker, um,

25:46.461 --> 25:49.146
I've got a webinar presentation.

25:49.297 --> 25:51.148
She was killed over a week ago.

25:52.133 --> 25:55.194
And the body they were gonna
ship back to London wasn't hers.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.906
Your corporate office was one
of the last numbers she called.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.661
Uh, jeez, I'm... I'm...

26:05.063 --> 26:08.791
I'm very sorry to hear about that,
accept my condolences.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.001
I just need some help.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.695
Tell me the last time she was here,

26:12.696 --> 26:15.214
times, dates, anything,
please, I'm begging you.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.049
I'd really love to help you,

26:17.117 --> 26:20.244
but if you came here
for those answers from me,

26:20.245 --> 26:22.888
I'm sorry, again, I really am.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.433
I don't know, this city, it's...

26:27.460 --> 26:29.478
I don't know,
it just gets rougher...

26:30.922 --> 26:34.274
It's rotten, especially if you're a pretty,
little blonde, you know? It's just...

26:35.594 --> 26:37.778
I never mentioned the
color of her hair.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.949
I'm sorry, uh... Saphire.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.327
Please, just look at her picture.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.124
That's her. It's a different
girl, it's not Sam.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.465
Sorry.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.677
Can you show him
downstairs, please, guys?

27:01.995 --> 27:03.387
All right.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.849
Good luck to you.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.767
Follow me.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.650
Certainly, sir, just one moment.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.027
Transferring you now.

27:21.806 --> 27:25.117
Most Industries.
One moment, please.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.620
- There's one other thing.
- It's time to leave.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.440
You want to watch that hand, mate.
You might just lose it.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.959
From a proper gent like you?
I don't think so.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.152
Most Industries.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.587
And I'm not asking you again.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.682
I need security to
suite 712 immediately!

28:00.804 --> 28:02.279
Down!

28:03.640 --> 28:05.365
Down! Get on the ground now!

28:07.352 --> 28:09.787
On your knees! Down!

28:10.355 --> 28:11.789
Get your hands behind your back.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.850
I could swear I just
left here an hour ago.

28:32.293 --> 28:34.269
Lieutenant's been all over my ass.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.797
Sheriff's Department pick
up a guy on assault charges

28:36.798 --> 28:39.024
and immediately contacted us.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.844
Last time I checked,
we were a major crimes unit.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.429
You might want to remind
the Lieutenant that

28:43.430 --> 28:45.305
next time he calls us in
for something like this.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.740
I'll keep that in mind.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.475
The assailant's a British national.

28:48.476 --> 28:51.311
Military contractor,
Iraq, Afghanistan.

28:51.312 --> 28:55.399
Got picked up at the offices of Most
Industries down in Century City.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.359
Apparently he got into
a heated argument

28:57.360 --> 29:00.112
and beat the living daylights
out of the security detail.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.156
Here's the catch. He says
that his daughter was missing

29:02.157 --> 29:04.950
and he was trying to track her down
through her last known employer.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.135
Her name's Samantha Walker.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.497
Our San Pedro victim?

29:10.498 --> 29:13.976
Yeah, told the arresting officers
that they got the wrong girl.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.961
Well, find out if there's
any truth to it.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.102
Have Henderson pull the file
and bring it down here.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.524
- Yeah.
- I'll see what I can get out of him.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.238
Welcome to Los Angeles, Mr. Walker.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.951
Long way across the pond, huh?

29:32.687 --> 29:35.038
How long before I can
get out of here?

29:36.816 --> 29:38.959
Well, it's not that simple.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.919
Sure it is.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.489
I know all about the
American justice system.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.758
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah, set the arraignment and let's go.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.973
I've heard about your daughter.
I have a young son.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.542
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

29:55.543 --> 29:59.646
Is there anyone in this
town who'll listen to me?

30:00.381 --> 30:03.150
I'm gonna say it again
for the last time.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.885
My daughter's not dead.

30:04.886 --> 30:08.822
The body they were gonna ship
back to London is not Samantha's.

30:09.724 --> 30:12.993
Well, maybe you could tell me
why you busted up that place.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.917
That guy, um, Schuuster...

30:21.069 --> 30:23.111
He's not telling me everything.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.671
He knows Sam.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.925
You're right about that.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.619
See, he gave us a
full statement today

30:30.620 --> 30:32.579
and luckily he's not
gonna press charges.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.747
Well, isn't that big of him?

30:33.748 --> 30:36.667
Well, he's got 12 months from
this date to change his mind,

30:36.668 --> 30:39.853
so if I were you, Mr. Walker,
I'd leave it alone.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.858
Look, I did not go in
there to cause trouble.

30:45.093 --> 30:49.529
All I want to do is find my girl, get her
safe, and bring her home, that's it.

30:55.436 --> 30:56.603
Excuse me a minute.

30:56.604 --> 30:58.789
Don't worry, mate. I'll be here.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.019
All right, I pulled the file.
Here's what we're looking at.

31:08.783 --> 31:09.867
There's not much on her.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.552
Some parking tickets and shit,
until about a month ago,

31:12.579 --> 31:16.223
when she got arrested at a DUI checkpoint
at a bar in the Valley called Cabos.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.583
Look at this picture.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.502
It was taken four weeks ago
the night she got arrested.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.880
And this one was taken
at the crime scene

31:22.881 --> 31:24.861
right after they pulled
the body from the water.

31:26.509 --> 31:30.696
I don't know, it's hard to tell, but
the limey may be telling the truth.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.907
Pull the box.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.634
The police are cutting
him loose in an hour.

31:52.660 --> 31:56.346
My contact at the department said
you refused to press charges.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.266
Your contact?

32:00.001 --> 32:04.438
That would actually imply that
you knew what you were doing.

32:05.423 --> 32:09.317
With all due respect, with Walker
in jail, it buys us more time.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.777
For what?

32:12.472 --> 32:14.489
I mean, if the girl was alive,

32:15.558 --> 32:16.767
the easiest way to track her

32:16.768 --> 32:19.645
is through the one man that
wants her as badly as we do.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.997
Now that would be a good idea,
don't you think?

32:23.524 --> 32:25.125
Don't worry, I'm on it.

32:25.443 --> 32:29.171
You're on it, you're on it.

32:29.572 --> 32:33.075
See, here's the thing.

32:33.076 --> 32:36.595
You were responsible for all
this in the first place.

32:36.788 --> 32:41.058
Why in God's name would I let you
go fuck this up over again, why?

32:41.376 --> 32:44.252
We trailed her, from her
apartment to the night club,

32:44.253 --> 32:45.979
exactly where you said she'd be.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.482
Did you get the right girl?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.968
She fit the description
you gave us.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.069
Right.

33:01.562 --> 33:04.539
You know, when I came to
this city, it was in disarray.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.109
Manufacturing was messed up,

33:07.110 --> 33:11.113
corporations were going bankrupt, because
of their problems with the union labor,

33:11.114 --> 33:12.506
but I changed all that.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.283
See I had a lot of cash to lend.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.469
There were borrowers
all around the block.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.746
So basically I...

33:19.747 --> 33:23.058
I painted a new face on the
city, I made it look clean.

33:23.751 --> 33:26.503
So I became Mr. Wonderful,

33:26.504 --> 33:29.189
with love and respect
from just about everyone.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.610
You respect me, Saphire?

33:34.721 --> 33:38.281
See, I don't think so, because now,

33:38.391 --> 33:42.811
for the first time ever, I got
goddamn cops all around my house.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.038
Because of you, you fucking moron!

34:01.956 --> 34:05.725
1881, Castaic. That's
where he used to live.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.170
I want you to go there,
gather up the family,

34:08.170 --> 34:10.438
anybody with the name of Saphire,
make 'em go away.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.203
I would love to hear
you beg for your life,

34:14.302 --> 34:15.944
but you'd bore the shit out of me.

34:18.681 --> 34:21.408
Go on, Baron. Do what I told you.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.024
So these are all the effects

34:29.025 --> 34:31.751
that were found on the body of
the woman in the photograph.

34:31.985 --> 34:35.030
It's your daughter's passport, driver's
license and multiple credit cards.

34:35.031 --> 34:38.425
You can see how it
would be an easy miss.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.011
You can justify it all
you want, Detective.

34:41.536 --> 34:44.164
You gotta admit, you and
your men were sloppy.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.248
Oh, is that right?

34:45.248 --> 34:46.600
Yeah.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.565
Sure has a lot of plastic for a
25-year-old, don't you think?

34:54.675 --> 34:57.094
Yeah, well, what can I say?
Girls like to shop, don't they?

34:57.178 --> 35:00.238
Or she got turned upside
down, over-extended.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.117
What's this got to do with the
fact that my daughter's missing?

35:04.602 --> 35:06.161
We're not sure of anything.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.455
Total bollocks, the lot of it.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.109
Let me ask you a
question, Mr. Walker.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.295
When was the last time you
actually spoke to your daughter?

35:20.618 --> 35:23.595
Are we through here, Detective?

35:25.039 --> 35:26.973
My partner will walk you out.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.997
Taxi.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.587
Do you know a bar called Los Cabos?

36:37.737 --> 36:40.797
Here's 100. Keep it running,
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.343
Fucking slag!

37:09.602 --> 37:11.077
Excuse me.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.540
I said, excuse me!

37:15.691 --> 37:18.293
- Can I get a drink?
- What do you need?

37:18.319 --> 37:21.671
How you doing? I want
a whiskey and a pint.

37:21.822 --> 37:22.989
What?

37:22.990 --> 37:25.158
A whiskey and a pint.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.760
$10.50.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.605
$100, keep it.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.273
Thanks.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.777
Let me get a favor.
You see that girl?

37:44.512 --> 37:46.012
You ever seen her in here?

37:46.013 --> 37:47.947
No, I've never seen
her around here.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.684
You need to take a closer
look at this, try it again.

37:50.685 --> 37:51.825
Have you seen her in here?

37:52.561 --> 37:54.496
Like I said, I've never seen her.

37:55.147 --> 37:59.793
Well, she got nicked right outside at
a DUI checkpoint, about a month ago.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.462
They said she was in here.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.255
You a cop?

38:04.365 --> 38:07.575
I'm a long way from home.
I'm just an interested party.

38:07.576 --> 38:08.843
Now, have you seen her?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.638
Haven't seen her.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.693
Give me another one.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.990
And here's another $100 for you.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.955
Now let me jog your fucking memory.

38:37.523 --> 38:41.209
Five foot eight, young blonde,
really easy on the eyes.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.696
She got caught by the police about
a month ago leaving this place.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.172
Now, have you seen her or not?

39:06.218 --> 39:07.944
Now I've got your attention.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.031
Her name is Samantha Walker.

39:13.976 --> 39:19.122
Blonde hair, medium height, she's
missing and she's my daughter.

39:20.066 --> 39:25.295
Now, please, please, if there's
anyone who might know anything.

39:27.740 --> 39:30.008
I have $10,000 here in cash.

39:31.285 --> 39:34.721
For any information that might
lead me to her whereabouts.

39:36.207 --> 39:40.351
And the cash is yours, if I
find her where you tell me.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.397
Anyone?

40:00.064 --> 40:01.623
Hey.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.666
I know the girl you're looking for.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.336
Is that right? So where is she?

40:07.196 --> 40:09.364
I tell you that and what's
to guarantee I get paid?

40:09.365 --> 40:13.384
Listen to me carefully,
I'm not playing any games here.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.329
But if you are,
I'm gonna be back for this

40:16.330 --> 40:18.264
and you ain't gonna want that,
do you get me?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.143
The Roux. I saw her
there a few times

40:22.336 --> 40:26.397
and then heard she was hanging out with
one of the guys that runs the place.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.551
So let's call this a finder's fee.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.010
You take me to that place,
you get the rest.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.511
That's bullshit, asshole!
I told you what you wanted to know.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.849
If I found her, that was the
offer and that was the deal.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.601
I mean, for all I know, you could be
leading me on some wild fucking chase.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.578
How would I know that?

40:42.606 --> 40:46.125
You want the full 10 grand,
you show me where she is.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.796
Let's go.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.178
That's our guy. Call it in.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.068
I can't believe I'm doing this.

41:29.069 --> 41:31.087
You could be a serial
killer, for all I know.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.256
Yeah, that's right.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.326
Something tells me you'd still
drive me around all night

41:36.327 --> 41:38.845
if you thought you were gonna
get your hands on my money.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.432
Whatever.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.143
You know my daughter?

41:45.669 --> 41:48.146
That's what I said, I know her.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.483
So where are you taking me?

41:52.968 --> 41:55.612
To the club in Hollywood.

41:55.721 --> 41:59.115
It's an old warehouse they
transitioned a while back.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.726
- Did she work there?
- I don't know.

42:01.727 --> 42:03.937
Well, you said you saw her
in there, make up your mind.

42:03.938 --> 42:07.165
Yeah, I saw her there. I don't
know what she was doing.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.609
I don't, like, keep track
of her, but I saw her.

42:09.610 --> 42:11.528
Look, if this is gonna
be a waste of my time,

42:11.529 --> 42:14.297
you can pull over now and
give me my money back.

42:15.574 --> 42:18.384
Or you can answer my questions.

42:19.286 --> 42:22.889
What was she involved in and
who was she involved with?

42:24.041 --> 42:28.394
Ricky Cummins, he runs the club.

42:29.046 --> 42:33.066
They came in to Cabos a few
times after hours to score.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.235
And how would you know that?

42:36.929 --> 42:39.155
Because I'm the one
that hooked 'em up.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.992
Just get us there.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.964
All right, just be cool in here. These
guys don't respond well to hooligans.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.257
So what does this geezer look like?

43:14.258 --> 43:16.009
Just let me take care of it.
They know me here.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.510
Look, just tell me,
what does he look like?

43:17.511 --> 43:19.846
Just wait here for me,
I'm cool with them.

43:19.847 --> 43:21.472
They're not gonna respond to you.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.199
Be cool, okay?

43:26.186 --> 43:28.955
Excuse me, sorry, sorry, excuse me.

43:29.523 --> 43:31.274
- Hi, sorry.
- No dudes.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.734
- Excuse me.
- You and your friends are fine.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.485
Hey, Romeo, I need to talk to you.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.653
I'm busy.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.922
Yeah, I see that.
She can take a break.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.784
Hey, you're looking good.

43:41.785 --> 43:43.244
So are you, what's up?

43:43.245 --> 43:44.454
I got this guy with me.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.764
No, no guys. Why are you here?

43:47.333 --> 43:50.209
See the guy in the
brown leather jacket?

43:50.210 --> 43:52.562
He's asking questions
about your girlfriend.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.214
What?

43:55.215 --> 43:57.550
I don't know, look, I just told him
I'd bring him here to talk to you.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.635
Just talk to the guy.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.178
I don't know that guy,

44:00.179 --> 44:01.863
and by the way, no, this is
not happening right now.

44:01.930 --> 44:03.640
- So just...
- Why the fuck did you do that?

44:03.641 --> 44:05.642
I told him I'd bring him,
what am I supposed to do?

44:05.643 --> 44:06.726
- For what, though?
- I don't know.

44:06.727 --> 44:07.935
I don't know what he wants.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.228
Excuse me, hey, is this the guy?

44:09.229 --> 44:11.731
- Listen, I need to talk to you. This him?
- Hey, I don't know you, buddy.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.358
I need to talk to you for
one minute, come here.

44:13.359 --> 44:14.500
Fuck!

44:15.736 --> 44:16.836
What the...

44:28.082 --> 44:30.183
Pick up! Come on, baby! Pick up!

44:34.421 --> 44:37.523
Honey, pick up the fucking phone!
Pick up the fucking phone!

44:47.184 --> 44:48.409
Just settle down.

44:48.727 --> 44:50.478
- All I want to do is talk to you.
- All right.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.830
Now, listen to me. You see that?

44:53.774 --> 44:55.875
That's my daughter, Sam.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.820
Now she was found dead of
an apparent drug overdose.

44:58.821 --> 45:02.799
But the body they was gonna ship
back to London was that girl.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.035
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

45:06.036 --> 45:07.136
No, I wouldn't.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.956
Look, I had no idea about that.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.624
I don't know why you're fu...

45:14.837 --> 45:17.755
Okay, I might... I might know a
little something about that.

45:17.756 --> 45:18.881
Right.

45:18.882 --> 45:20.591
She came by the club a
couple of weeks ago.

45:20.592 --> 45:22.427
Two guys like you came,
they picked her up,

45:22.428 --> 45:23.636
that's the last I saw of her.

45:23.637 --> 45:24.971
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Don't give me shit.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.139
I told you the fucking
truth, buddy. Okay?

45:26.140 --> 45:28.407
Lex!

45:35.983 --> 45:37.291
Jesus Christ.

45:37.693 --> 45:38.818
Get over here!

45:38.819 --> 45:41.112
Come here right now, Ricky Cummins!

45:41.113 --> 45:42.630
Step away from the car!

45:42.698 --> 45:44.966
What's your problem, mate?
We don't want any trouble.

45:46.493 --> 45:48.774
You don't want any trouble?
Well, you got fucking trouble!

46:05.721 --> 46:07.196
What the fuck?

46:12.436 --> 46:14.312
What are you doing?
What's going on?

46:14.313 --> 46:16.080
You tell me, mate.

46:17.065 --> 46:18.232
Go and get the car.

46:18.233 --> 46:19.317
No, wait, we've gotta figure...

46:19.318 --> 46:21.794
- Go and get the car now!
- Okay.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.880
They... They're fucking dead!

46:24.072 --> 46:27.633
You've got exactly 30 seconds
to tell me where she is.

46:27.785 --> 46:31.829
Otherwise, you're gonna end up on the
fucking floor dead like the rest of them.

46:31.830 --> 46:33.039
- You got me?
- Yeah.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.457
- Where is she?
- She's...

46:34.458 --> 46:36.017
She's on Wilshire, I can take you.

46:36.710 --> 46:39.228
- You're coming with us.
- Okay.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.697
Silver one, right there. Get in.

47:05.030 --> 47:06.964
Just try and get us there
in one piece, yeah?

47:07.074 --> 47:09.200
Are you kidding me? We're
fleeing the scene of a crime!

47:09.201 --> 47:11.302
Well, then, try not to
make it so obvious!

47:20.754 --> 47:22.630
Directions, where are
we going? Tell her.

47:22.631 --> 47:24.090
Go over Laurel Canyon.

47:24.091 --> 47:26.467
When you get down to Wilshire,
hit the 101 South, downtown.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.194
And then, I'll show you from there.

47:35.561 --> 47:36.869
So why they after you?

47:37.104 --> 47:40.665
Most Industries is a front, okay?
It doesn't exist.

47:40.691 --> 47:44.318
It's a shell Internet company.
They steal people's identities.

47:44.319 --> 47:46.112
Explain to me how.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.047
Credit cards, payroll cards,

47:48.198 --> 47:51.117
and they put, like, $5,000
to $10,000 on the cards.

47:51.118 --> 47:53.059
They sell them to guys
like me for half price.

47:53.912 --> 47:55.872
And then I sell them at the
club, that's what I do.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.206
You expect me to believe that shit?

47:57.207 --> 47:59.333
I swear to God,
I'm telling you the truth.

47:59.334 --> 48:00.459
That's what we do.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.812
So, tell me, how is
my daughter involved?

48:03.463 --> 48:04.843
You'll have to ask her yourself.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.818
Don't worry, mate, I plan on it.

48:40.792 --> 48:42.601
Detectives.

48:43.420 --> 48:46.731
All right, so, we got the
call about an hour ago.

48:47.049 --> 48:51.444
Witnesses reported a fight broke out
outside the club, and spilling out here.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.596
And no one can confirm
spotting any of the victims

48:53.597 --> 48:55.139
before they were found
lying right there.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.557
Description on the assailant?

48:56.558 --> 48:59.018
It all happened so fast,
what we got is spotty at best.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.439
Spotty what? Spotty whites,
spotty blacks? Spotty Hispanic?

49:01.688 --> 49:04.874
Uh, Caucasian male,
40's, large build.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.818
One of the bartenders said he
had some sort of crazy accent,

49:07.819 --> 49:09.295
so he definitely wasn't from here.

49:11.198 --> 49:13.240
He was seen chasing after
the guy who ran the club,

49:13.241 --> 49:15.885
a guy by the name of Ricky Cummins.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.472
You got any IDs on the victims?

49:19.873 --> 49:23.084
No, no wallets, no cash, they've
just got their own prints on them.

49:23.085 --> 49:26.170
Talk to security, find out if they
had cameras on top of the doors

49:26.171 --> 49:28.464
or is there any kind of surveillance
on the exterior of the club.

49:28.465 --> 49:29.565
Will do.

49:30.217 --> 49:33.319
I want to find out where
these guys came from.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.721
- Run down that Ricky.
- Ricky Cummins.

49:35.722 --> 49:38.683
- Run him down.
- Will do.

49:38.684 --> 49:41.060
Double tap is within a few
centimeters of the first shot.

49:41.061 --> 49:45.414
Accent, military precision,
leaves us with about one choice.

49:46.233 --> 49:47.416
Yup.

49:47.484 --> 49:51.737
Call dispatch, get a couple black and whites
out to the residence of Karl Schuuster.

49:51.738 --> 49:54.131
Tell them we'll be following.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.842
You got it.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.057
Are you sure about this?

50:20.058 --> 50:22.935
Of course, I'm sure about this.
This is the safe house, buddy.

50:22.936 --> 50:25.730
We set it up a month ago
when she got popped.

50:25.731 --> 50:27.898
- So how do we get inside?
- We don't get inside.

50:27.899 --> 50:29.400
Remember when I was running
through the parking lot?

50:29.401 --> 50:30.443
I had the phone, I threw it?

50:30.444 --> 50:33.154
That's the only connection we have.
You can't get inside right now.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.572
- Stay here.
- Stay here, what?

50:34.573 --> 50:36.382
You can't get inside,
I'm telling you.

50:54.801 --> 50:55.968
What do you want?

50:55.969 --> 50:59.180
Go and tell Sam that daddy's
here to take her home.

50:59.181 --> 51:00.364
Man, it's late, all right?

51:00.557 --> 51:01.891
And I don't have
time for your bullshit.

51:01.892 --> 51:04.743
Get the fuck out of here
before I call my boys down.

51:04.853 --> 51:07.313
There's nobody here by that name,
you got the wrong address.

51:17.991 --> 51:20.509
Sam! Sam!

51:22.746 --> 51:24.096
Sam!

51:24.456 --> 51:25.890
Wait, wait... Where are you...

51:26.708 --> 51:27.892
Sam!

51:43.350 --> 51:44.992
Sam!

52:12.045 --> 52:13.312
Dad?

52:15.841 --> 52:17.550
What are you doing here?

52:17.551 --> 52:18.884
We're with him.

52:18.885 --> 52:20.319
What?

52:36.570 --> 52:38.362
- Where is he?
- Back there.

52:38.363 --> 52:39.713
All right.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.430
- No, that would not be the case.
- I got it.

52:49.916 --> 52:51.917
- Uh, Detective Michael Klein.
- How you doing?

52:51.918 --> 52:53.544
This is my partner, Det...

52:53.545 --> 52:56.589
Hey, uh, look, I was just
telling your man over here

52:56.590 --> 53:00.759
that, uh, I have the utmost
confidence in my security system here

53:00.760 --> 53:05.406
and, uh, as you can see, I really
have no need for officers here.

53:05.432 --> 53:08.492
I don't think you understand
the severity of the situation.

53:08.518 --> 53:12.188
We are tracking a suspect who's involved
in a shooting on the West side.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.190
Left three people dead.

53:14.191 --> 53:17.735
Now his description very
closely resembles the man

53:17.736 --> 53:20.362
who was arrested in your
office earlier today.

53:20.363 --> 53:23.215
Well, why would you
think he'd come here?

53:23.283 --> 53:26.802
He believes his daughter, who
used to work for you, is missing.

53:27.204 --> 53:31.307
Miss Walker was found dead of a
drug overdose about a week ago, no?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.225
It's not public knowledge.

53:33.627 --> 53:35.728
Well, I'm sure it's not.

53:36.296 --> 53:38.876
I had this little conversation
with a lieutenant earlier today.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.443
Chatted a bit.

53:43.136 --> 53:45.512
Well, that case is still
pending a review.

53:45.513 --> 53:47.072
Yeah, right.

53:47.641 --> 53:50.534
Well, I mean, it could be, uh...

53:52.479 --> 53:55.356
Of course, this is my view,

53:55.357 --> 53:59.501
just one of the normal cases where
these young kids come in here.

54:00.278 --> 54:05.132
Want to be attractive, people who
look for their fame and fortune,

54:06.534 --> 54:09.453
and, uh, things don't work out and they
leave about as fast as they got here,

54:09.454 --> 54:12.389
except they look a
little worse, you know?

54:13.166 --> 54:14.808
Yeah, that happens.

54:15.085 --> 54:17.269
Mr. Schuuster, you may
still be able to help us.

54:17.671 --> 54:20.314
Have you ever seen
these men before?

54:22.425 --> 54:26.737
Um, no, no,
I can't say that I have.

54:28.598 --> 54:31.934
Listen, I really appreciate you
looking out for my best interest,

54:31.935 --> 54:34.286
but, uh, you'll have to excuse me.

54:34.312 --> 54:38.207
There's, uh... I have some special
guests I'd like to attend to.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.793
I don't blame you, yeah.

54:41.653 --> 54:44.446
Tell you what, we'd like to keep
a couple officers out front,

54:44.447 --> 54:45.631
in case this suspect...

54:45.782 --> 54:49.051
No, no, that's really
not necessary.

54:49.536 --> 54:50.911
Just the same.

54:50.912 --> 54:55.974
Okay, then, well, you'll just have to
submit a request to the board, uh,

54:56.042 --> 54:57.726
you know that oversees
these estates.

54:59.379 --> 55:03.315
Uh, that would be, I think,
the first Tuesday in every month.

55:06.052 --> 55:08.612
Anyway, you guys have a
nice night, nice meeting you.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.307
Hi, girls.

55:11.308 --> 55:12.933
We're happy to have you back.

55:12.934 --> 55:16.078
Did you miss me?
Well, I'm happy to be here.

55:16.730 --> 55:20.040
- You believe one word of that bullshit?
- Not one.

55:20.525 --> 55:24.820
Call Judge Booth, see if we can get
authorization for a surveillance team.

55:24.821 --> 55:27.798
- At this hour?
- Let's wake his lazy ass up.

55:32.245 --> 55:34.079
Thanks.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.514
Mmm.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.854
Excuse me for a minute,
will you, honey?

55:42.547 --> 55:44.256
The last contact was
several hours ago.

55:44.257 --> 55:46.358
It seems they've completely
fallen off the grid.

55:48.720 --> 55:51.930
Listen, gather everybody we got.

55:51.931 --> 55:53.515
I want him and her back here.

55:53.516 --> 55:55.392
I don't care if they're
standing or laying down.

55:55.393 --> 55:57.436
I want them back here now, come on.

55:57.437 --> 55:58.871
Yes, sir.

56:14.788 --> 56:16.088
Give me one of those, can you?

56:17.123 --> 56:18.223
Sure.

56:21.086 --> 56:22.628
- That good?
- Thanks.

56:22.629 --> 56:23.729
You're welcome.

56:32.305 --> 56:34.448
Nobody heard nothing.
We should be good for now.

56:34.891 --> 56:37.351
No, if he can find us, so can they.

56:37.352 --> 56:40.412
We... We have to get packed
and moved out of here tonight.

56:52.784 --> 56:54.644
I see you've got your
mother's taste in men.

56:55.328 --> 56:58.096
Present company excluded.

57:04.170 --> 57:07.523
Easy, there, Dad. It looks
like you've taken a few hits.

57:08.508 --> 57:11.109
Yeah, I have, and you know why?

57:12.595 --> 57:14.056
Because I've been looking for you.

57:15.849 --> 57:17.433
I mean, Sam, what was you thinking,

57:17.434 --> 57:20.202
disappearing like that
without even contacting me.

57:20.353 --> 57:21.895
Don't start with me now.

57:21.896 --> 57:25.149
Do you know something?
If your mother was alive...

57:25.150 --> 57:28.377
God, if she was alive, she'd have
been worried sick and panic-stricken.

57:28.695 --> 57:30.462
Hmm, but not you.

57:31.030 --> 57:32.656
That's not what I said.

57:32.657 --> 57:35.133
I haven't heard from you in months.

57:37.704 --> 57:40.138
Do you know something?

57:40.415 --> 57:44.768
I've been beaten up, nearly
stabbed, shot at, and electrocuted.

57:45.712 --> 57:48.313
All things I'm sure you've
grown accustomed to.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.316
Do you have any idea...

57:51.885 --> 57:53.844
Any idea...

57:53.845 --> 57:55.625
What it's been like for
me this past week?

57:56.890 --> 57:59.933
Not knowing whether you was alive or
dead, who you was with, where you was.

57:59.934 --> 58:03.078
I mean, for all I know, you could have
been lying dead in a ditch somewhere!

58:03.771 --> 58:07.332
You know, you never seemed
to care before, so why now?

58:10.236 --> 58:12.421
I'll tell you exactly why.

58:13.364 --> 58:16.508
Because you're the only
one I've got left now.

58:18.745 --> 58:21.305
And like it or not,
you're still my daughter.

58:23.708 --> 58:25.542
Look, listen to me, there...

58:25.543 --> 58:28.604
There was only one thing
I was ever good at.

58:28.880 --> 58:31.315
And being a young dad wasn't it.

58:33.551 --> 58:35.694
But I'm here now for you.

58:41.142 --> 58:42.643
Yeah.

58:42.644 --> 58:46.204
Please, you've got to believe me,
I'm not here to judge you.

58:47.065 --> 58:49.374
I don't care what trouble
you've got yourself into.

58:51.903 --> 58:54.004
All I care about is you.

58:54.656 --> 58:57.633
That you're safe and I
can bring you home.

59:07.794 --> 59:10.629
I needed everyone in my
life to believe I was dead.

59:10.630 --> 59:12.891
Because if he knew I was still
alive, he'd be after me.

59:17.095 --> 59:18.528
This is what he wants.

59:23.476 --> 59:29.081
Schuuster created a series of Internet
banks and an online lending solution.

59:29.482 --> 59:31.124
It was a phishing scam.

59:31.317 --> 59:33.694
Every applicant that
went to the website

59:33.695 --> 59:37.172
submitted information that
he used to steal their identity.

59:38.741 --> 59:41.134
This is a database that
contains the names

59:41.160 --> 59:43.970
of hundreds of thousands of
people that he's stolen from.

59:44.664 --> 59:46.264
So how has he not been caught?

59:46.374 --> 59:50.294
The websites were set up at hosting
facilities all over the country.

59:50.295 --> 59:52.838
The sites would be up for
a week and then removed.

59:52.839 --> 59:56.049
Nothing, not even an imprint
was left to chance.

59:56.050 --> 59:57.968
So how did you get
involved in this?

59:57.969 --> 01:00:02.155
I was hired as a programmer to
manage the root access database.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.991
Good morning, Most Industries.
How may I direct your call?

01:00:05.226 --> 01:00:08.103
Several months ago,
I started finding discrepancies

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:12.374
in the risk scoring that was used to
approve and deny loan applications.

01:00:13.818 --> 01:00:17.337
So I tracked it through to the
credit services department.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.800
And that's when I met...

01:00:25.663 --> 01:00:27.055
What, this fucking geezer?

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:28.306
Jesus, Dad.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.375
I needed more time.

01:00:30.376 --> 01:00:31.810
For what?

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.311
I broke the code.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:40.652
I found a way to back up the database,
so I could get it in the hands of the FBI.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:45.724
But I knew if they arrested him, he'd still
have the resources to come after me.

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.559
So I needed a way out.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.896
Then I created a series
of accounts and identities.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.856
And I funded it with
10 million dollars

01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:55.667
that I got from the Most
Industries ledger account.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:02.632
I simply had to merge the new database
into the mainframe host processor.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:06.203
And once the cards were created,

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:09.723
I could activate the accounts
and transfer the funds.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.185
Schuuster's people were never
prepared for an internal breach.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.421
Are you sure these are clean?

01:01:16.422 --> 01:01:19.966
Yeah, I bought the plane
tickets with them today.

01:01:19.967 --> 01:01:21.443
So I need your passport.

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.696
Before I had a chance
to transfer the funds...

01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:27.032
Mmm.

01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:31.661
I knew I only had a few days before
Schuuster found out I was arrested.

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:36.082
I was able to get the
accounts activated,

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:39.878
but I didn't have enough
time to transfer the funds.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:52.165
It's just a small piece of the pie,
nothing that he would even notice.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.625
Then why did he want you dead?

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:57.170
Well, when I was busted,
they caught his cards on me.

01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:59.564
And then he knew I
was a risk to him.

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.024
And the other girl?

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.109
Let me know as soon
as you cash them.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.320
- Okay, I will.
- Thank you so much.

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:08.657
Cathy was my roommate.

01:02:10.017 --> 01:02:14.037
After I ran from the office,
I had her met up with Ricky.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.653
There wasn't enough time.

01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:25.757
So Ricky was the only one that
could still get into the facility.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.637
But it was too late.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.499
So the money's in limbo and
everyone wants it back.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.103
You know, there's still a way
for us to do this clean.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:43.043
Yeah, well, I don't see that unless
we get inside that building.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:46.778
Schuuster has a secondary server set
up in his panic room in his estate.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:58.356
So we don't have to break into the office,
we just have to get into that room.

01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:00.166
Yeah, well, how do you
propose we do that?

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:01.918
I have an idea.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:06.548
There is one thing that he
likes better than money.

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.679
What? I'm missing
something, what is it?

01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:11.303
Escorts.

01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:15.974
What? No, no!

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.184
Come on, it's the only
way we can get inside.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.839
No, look, our deal was 10,000
if I helped you find her.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.940
That's it, done.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:25.734
You're a target now, just like us.

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.469
Bullshit, I am.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.804
She's right.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:33.033
I mean, how long do you think it's gonna
be before he finds out you was involved?

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.102
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:37.913
Here you go, 10 grand.

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:41.708
Nice doing business with you.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.585
Fifty grand.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.157
You're gonna have to
do better than that, mate.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:50.675
All right,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:53.678
Let's make it an even
hundred thousand.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:24.054
And how is it we still
can't tie the rental car

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.195
to either Most Industries
or Karl Schuuster?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.531
We've been over this.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.216
Well, tell me again.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:35.620
The credit card was
authorized three days ago.

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:37.998
Who made the reservation,
who signed for the car,

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:40.292
and why is it being declined now?

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.836
Credit card was stolen from
a Michael Hicks out of Detroit.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.297
He was at home,
alive and well today.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:47.065
That's not our guy.

01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.402
Son of a bitch.

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.141
This is Klein.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.922
Are you looking for me, Detective?

01:04:59.478 --> 01:05:00.912
Walker.

01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:04.733
Where are you?

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.751
I'm very, very close by,
funny enough.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.466
I need a trace on
415, caller's on now.

01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:15.201
I was actually gonna pop in and ask

01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:17.637
if you fancied a cup of tea,
if you weren't too busy.

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:19.039
Yeah, no, not at all,

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.393
there's a good coffee shop on the
corner of Fairfax and Burdon.

01:05:23.961 --> 01:05:25.629
Sounds really nice,
but something tells me

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:29.607
there might be a full SWAT team
just waiting for me to arrive.

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:32.677
Is that how you think
this is gonna go down?

01:05:32.678 --> 01:05:36.389
Well, to be honest with you, I reckon
I'd get within say 50 feet of the place

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:39.225
before you had me cuffed
and pinned to the floor.

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:43.730
Well, at least that'll give us
time to talk about Ricky Cummins

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.790
and that night club you
tore up last night.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:50.670
That was self-defense. I was attacked.
We was nowhere near the night club.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:54.966
If you're innocent, come in.
I'll help you.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:58.928
What and allow Schuuster to carry on
doing what he's doing? I don't think so.

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:01.289
There's nothing to suggest
he's doing anything illegal.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.141
And if there was?

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.877
If you could pinpoint several
murders and executions

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:09.731
back to a financial scheme
that he himself perpetrated,

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.483
now what would you do?

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:15.011
Are you in possession
of this evidence?

01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:17.989
No, but you are, Detective.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.872
Not long enough.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.167
Let's go!

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.836
So how much time
do you think we have?

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:52.132
Well, it won't take long once
you get inside, but listen to me.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.567
If anything goes wrong in there

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.012
I want you to keep your head down
and get out as fast as you can,

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.471
- do you understand that?
- Dad...

01:06:58.472 --> 01:07:00.615
Listen, Sam, I'm serious.

01:07:01.642 --> 01:07:04.035
Look, I want you to take this.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:07.705
This is a number for a really
good mate of mine back in London.

01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:09.190
I didn't want to tell you,

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.668
but I've been saving up since
your mom died and all that.

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:15.713
But there's money there for you if
anything were to ever happen to me.

01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:18.842
Thank you, for everything.

01:07:19.076 --> 01:07:21.177
And you know I love you.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.416
- Hey.
- All right, I'll see you guys in the car.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.767
Yeah.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.962
Listen, remember
what I said to you.

01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:33.798
Park on the turn around, because
you've got the best vantage point.

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:34.349
Right.

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:36.551
Remember, lights out,
keep your eyes open.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:37.761
Okay.

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:40.263
When I give you that signal,
when you hear anything going down,

01:07:40.264 --> 01:07:41.306
I need you to be there.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.615
- Understand?
- Yeah.

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:44.742
- If anything happens there.
- Yeah.

01:07:44.935 --> 01:07:46.619
Listen, I want to say thanks.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:48.955
I appreciate it.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.752
Whoever sent you this knew
exactly what they were doing.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.212
Look, it's all names and
numbers to me, kid.

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:14.564
Just show me what
you're telling me.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.633
Take Nicholas Fields
here, all right?

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:19.484
Now when you click on
him, this window pops up.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.171
Which is everything you're gonna
need if you want to create this.

01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:26.184
Now meet Nick Fields.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.228
He's got over $30,000
in a checking account

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.564
several credit cards and a
debt-income ratio of 42 percent.

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:37.278
So, he makes a variation on the
naming convention and then boom.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.029
All of a sudden, our guy's
got a brand new identity.

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:40.173
Exactly.

01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:43.551
Give me a name, just
call something out.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:50.767
Michael Hicks.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.979
Michael Hicks, originated out of D-town,
he's got accounts over at Sierra National.

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.482
Pull him up.

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:10.703
- That's our guy.
- Yeah.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.832
Is there any way you can determine
who created this system?

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.335
Yeah, better than that.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:19.946
Now whoever developed this
database also added a map

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:23.925
to the IP where the server that
holds the master key is located.

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:28.095
So if you match this
address to that server

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:30.848
you're gonna find out who's
controlling everything.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:34.769
Call Judge Booth and get his
fat, lazy ass out of bed.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:40.133
I want warrants executed on Most Industries
and the estate of Karl Schuuster.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:42.777
We'll take that
fucker down tonight.

01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:44.569
Where are you going?

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.353
Stop! Come on, slow down.

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:21.341
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:23.676
Thank you for stopping,
my car broke down right here.

01:10:23.677 --> 01:10:25.803
You have no idea, I lost my cell
phone, I've been stuck here...

01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:27.597
I need your car, get out.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:29.115
Now pop the trunk, fool.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:34.746
Now give me the cap and walk away.

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:37.874
Get out!

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:22.418
Sam, now remember when we
get inside, you stay with me.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.089
And when I say stay with
me, you stay close.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:39.477
- I'm gonna take this, guys.
- All right.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:42.714
Yeah.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.399
Black Escalade,

01:11:45.759 --> 01:11:48.653
looks like Schuuster's
in for the night.

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:51.531
You get those warrants signed?

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:54.892
Got the ADA in there right now,
we need more time.

01:11:54.893 --> 01:11:58.396
Judge is balking at the prelim, says
the evidence is too circumstantial.

01:11:58.397 --> 01:11:59.897
No, it's because he's chicken shit.

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:02.166
It's a Beverly Hills address.

01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:06.796
You tell him to sign that or we're
gonna lose our window of opportunity.

01:12:07.614 --> 01:12:09.424
- Do it.
- All right.

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:27.733
Now remember, when we get inside,
everybody do exactly as I say.

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:01.184
Welcome, drive up
to the side entrance, please.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.061
Okay, here we go.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.833
Everybody get ready.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:06.040
I wasn't told there'd
be more than one,

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:07.775
my rate's double.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.076
That's not gonna be a problem.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:17.134
Okay, let's go.

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:23.516
Make yourself a drink.
He'll be with you in a moment.

01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:27.770
You stay with me,
stay close, all right?

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:04.332
That's right, my
margin stays the same.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.351
No, it doesn't change.
It's non-negotiable.

01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:11.564
10:00 tomorrow morning, yes or no?
Okay, goodbye.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.260
How we doing here tonight?

01:15:16.261 --> 01:15:17.778
In the red.

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:22.325
Oh, is it a late arrival?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.078
Says she's gonna charge you extra.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:31.334
Really? Hang onto this. I'm gonna
try to get my money's worth.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.097
Good evening.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:47.892
You are a vision, Miss...

01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:50.394
My friends call me Scarlett.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:55.274
Scarlett, isn't that from
that picture, the...

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.610
- Gone With The Wind?
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.612
Scarlett, I like that.

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:02.056
I'm sure you will.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.908
Really.

01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:05.826
Buy me a drink?

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.245
Sure, what would you like?

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:11.315
Always been a big fan of rum.

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:14.585
Rum, you are one lucky, young lady.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.073
Because me, I got a world-class
recipe for mojitos

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:21.576
which I got on my last
vacation, more or less.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:22.994
And where was that?

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.929
That would be Havana.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.456
Yeah, see, Germany
doesn't do it justice.

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:31.811
Oh, you know what the key is?

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:32.962
Tell me.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.022
- You won't tell anyone else.
- Never.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.525
You gotta use real sugar cane.

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:41.862
And you take some dark rum
and you float that, see?

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:43.948
The longer you wait,

01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:47.702
if you have patience,
it'll put a smile on your face.

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:52.456
I bet it will.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:54.984
- Let me go to work.
- Please.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.794
Don't you leave.

01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:11.876
What does it look like?

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:13.897
I don't know, it's gotta
be some sort of switch.

01:17:19.092 --> 01:17:20.651
Come on!

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.448
Jesus.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.680
Hang on to that,
just leave it there.

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:35.916
- I got it, Dad.
- Go ahead.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:38.711
Come.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:41.881
You follow me and you stay close.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:02.985
Quickly.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.263
Look at all this lot.

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:07.740
Focus, Dad.

01:18:12.437 --> 01:18:14.497
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:16.916
- Cheers to Havana.
- Cheers.

01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:22.004
Mmm.

01:18:26.618 --> 01:18:29.386
If we need it, now we got it.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:33.224
I'm gonna trust they've got online shit.

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:36.460
Let's hurry up.

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:37.561
Okay.

01:18:43.927 --> 01:18:46.195
We got a potential breach
on the second floor.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.865
Get me confirmation.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.369
Mmm, you were right.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.539
Does put a smile on my face.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.357
No, I was talking about me.

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:01.235
You know, if I hang
around a little bit.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:02.753
Oh, you're good.

01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:11.470
Master bedroom is clear.
Moving on to the office.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:14.265
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.959
Excuse me for a moment.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.435
Well, okay.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.480
Yes, how are you?

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.373
Ninety seconds!

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.053
So, um, what's your story?

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.667
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:19:58.668 --> 01:20:02.146
Oh, um, let me go get someone
to clean this up, okay?

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:05.216
Four and a half hours.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:08.152
Well, I was feeling a
little tired on that day.

01:20:08.845 --> 01:20:10.095
Beautiful home you have.

01:20:10.096 --> 01:20:11.764
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:13.390
What a beautiful dress you have.

01:20:13.391 --> 01:20:15.367
Thank you, you like it?

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:18.395
- I've become a fast worker.
- Are you?

01:20:23.026 --> 01:20:24.418
Looks like I'm empty.

01:20:24.569 --> 01:20:26.737
- Yes, yes, you are.
- Well, you could give me...

01:20:26.738 --> 01:20:29.214
Would you excuse us for a moment?

01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:31.258
Sure.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.744
Saved by the bell.

01:20:33.745 --> 01:20:35.721
Finally.

01:20:36.706 --> 01:20:38.891
So how warm is your pool?

01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:43.562
How warm is, um... Warm enough.

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:47.466
Warm enough for us to get in later?

01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:49.526
- Sounds like a good idea.
- Really?

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:14.051
Sam, hurry up! We've got
to get some company!

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:17.805
Come on with me! Come on!

01:21:32.637 --> 01:21:34.113
What the fuck is going on?

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:36.824
We've been breached!
Take this! Stay here!

01:21:37.642 --> 01:21:40.911
Come here, you bitch! Stop it!

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.148
Dispatch,
this is Edward Lincoln 12,

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:48.127
I need immediate back-up at
15715, Coldwater. Shots fired!

01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:25.372
Sam, we need to move now!

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.850
Got it!

01:23:39.931 --> 01:23:41.657
Quit it.

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:01.118
I need that backup in here now!

01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:19.403
Drop it!

01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:24.308
You put that fucking thing down or I
swear to Christ I'll blow her head off.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.742
Put it the fuck down.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.311
You shoot her,

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:30.747
there's no way you can stop them
putting a needle in your arm.

01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:34.818
You and half your fucking department
spent the whole day threatening me.

01:24:34.819 --> 01:24:36.528
Telling me how this guy
was gonna come kill me.

01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:38.046
There he is.

01:24:38.656 --> 01:24:40.757
That's not how it's gonna
go down, you know that.

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:47.206
Well, I'll take the gamble.
How about you, asshole?

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:48.599
Put it the fuck down.

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:51.668
You put that fucking thing down

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:53.529
or I swear to Christ
I'll blow her head off.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:00.903
Put it the fuck down!

01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:16.168
You shut up!

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:18.962
- Now kick it over.
- It's on the ground.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:23.717
Kick it the fuck over, asshole!

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:41.693
Schuuster!

01:26:23.094 --> 01:26:25.737
- Dad!
- Get her out of here, go now!

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:38.333
Give me the gun.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.515
I was first on the scene.

01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:58.812
The way I see it, I'd
already called for back-up.

01:26:59.422 --> 01:27:02.649
I was engaged by Schuuster's bodyguards
as soon as I got in the complex.

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.737
Schuuster tried to overpower me.

01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:11.074
In one last burst,
I overcame him and his men.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:16.079
That will be justifiable
in the eyes of the law.

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:20.834
It's gonna work.

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.087
You better get out of here.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:32.596
Thank you, Detective.

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:22.212
You know, at that range,

01:28:22.213 --> 01:28:25.565
you're lucky the bullet
didn't penetrate the vest.

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:29.820
Jesus Christ, partner.

01:28:30.596 --> 01:28:32.389
You think we got enough
for a warrant now?

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:35.392
Judge Booth signed off on it
the second the call came in.

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:37.769
The Lieutenant's scrambling
to cover his ass on this one.

01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:39.771
Well, he's always there when
you need him, isn't he?

01:28:39.772 --> 01:28:41.206
Oh, yeah.

01:28:43.359 --> 01:28:45.127
I'll leave you to it.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.547
This is Klein.

01:28:49.532 --> 01:28:53.076
Detective, listen, mate,
this is just a courtesy call.

01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:55.418
I'm just checking to see if
you have everything you need.

01:28:57.749 --> 01:29:03.061
Actually, no, it's gonna be a lot of months
before we can close the books on this one.

01:29:05.298 --> 01:29:07.799
It'd kind of be nice if we had
someone that could help us

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.110
tie everything together.
You know what I mean?

01:29:10.386 --> 01:29:13.029
Detective, look, after all
that we've been through...

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.366
Listen, mate, you'll sort
something out, I know you will.

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:18.618
Good luck.

01:29:21.814 --> 01:29:23.248
Walker?

01:29:28.821 --> 01:29:31.882
Mike, I need you to
come take a look at this.

01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:04.815
Listen, I almost forgot,
here you go.

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:06.274
Ooh, a hundred grand?

01:30:06.275 --> 01:30:08.084
Want to count it?

01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:11.671
Well, I figured I owed you a little
bit more after our big adventure.

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:15.383
Um, think I could hitch a ride?

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:17.802
What, on that?

01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:20.514
What else do I have to lose?

01:30:20.665 --> 01:30:22.390
Well, where'd you want to go?

01:30:23.167 --> 01:30:24.835
I don't know, where
do you want to go?

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:27.504
Why... Why does everything
have to be so difficult?
