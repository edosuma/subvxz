00:03.366 --> 00:04.533
[people screaming on TV]

00:04.600 --> 00:06.100
It's 2:00 in the morning.

00:06.166 --> 00:07.733
What are y'all still doin' up?

00:07.800 --> 00:10.466
There is good quality
programming on at this hour.

00:10.533 --> 00:11.966
That's "Godzilla."

00:14.300 --> 00:15.933
I know,
but if you look real close

00:16.000 --> 00:17.800
you see young Marlon Brando
being squashed

00:17.866 --> 00:19.866
by his mighty tail.

00:19.933 --> 00:21.800
Yeah, right,
you're not fooling me.

00:21.866 --> 00:23.633
Y'all just trippin'
because Kyle and Overton

00:23.700 --> 00:25.933
are not back
from that bachelor party yet.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.566
Not even!

00:27.633 --> 00:29.966
Overton told me it was gonna be
a very mundane affair.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.333
‐ Pfft.
‐ Yeah.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.766
Nothing says mundane like

00:32.833 --> 00:35.300
a stripper
and a few ping‐pong balls.

00:38.133 --> 00:39.933
Well, the way I see it,
they're just enjoying

00:40.000 --> 00:42.466
the time‐honored male tradition.
Acting stupid.

00:43.833 --> 00:45.366
How do you figure
into this visual?

00:45.433 --> 00:47.366
I'm here to lend support.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.633
And on the off chance,
there might be a big ugly fight.

00:52.633 --> 00:53.900
[knock on door]

00:53.966 --> 00:55.700
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey!

00:55.766 --> 00:58.833
Look who's back
from the boys club?

00:59.733 --> 01:02.173
So, you hidin' any hickeys?

01:04.640 --> 01:06.073
Be gone, little woman.

01:08.539 --> 01:09.806
What's wrong, Obie?

01:09.873 --> 01:12.806
Nothing, other than the fact
that my life has spun

01:12.873 --> 01:14.706
hopelessly out of control.

01:14.773 --> 01:16.973
Now, we were makin' our rounds
at the bachelor party, right?

01:17.040 --> 01:17.973
When we came across a few

01:18.040 --> 01:20.673
of the more
plebeian partiers watching..

01:20.740 --> 01:21.906
Uh, how should I put this?

01:21.973 --> 01:24.840
Um, a film geared toward

01:24.906 --> 01:26.406
mature sensibilities.

01:26.473 --> 01:28.040
[growls]

01:28.106 --> 01:29.640
[laughing]

01:29.706 --> 01:31.273
Oh, a skin flick!

01:31.340 --> 01:33.473
Standard, or girls‐with‐girls?

01:37.040 --> 01:38.706
Sadly, the former. Ha!

01:38.773 --> 01:39.906
Uh, well, at any rate

01:39.973 --> 01:41.973
we couldn't help but notice
a certain actor

01:42.040 --> 01:43.306
who had a vague resemblance

01:43.373 --> 01:46.406
to a certain handyman, oh!

01:49.073 --> 01:50.006
"Vague?"

01:50.073 --> 01:51.240
It was like I was standing

01:51.306 --> 01:53.406
in front
of a full‐length mirror.

01:53.473 --> 01:55.540
And I do mean full‐length.

I have got some real news.

02:36.513 --> 02:38.413
This afternoon
I am going to land

02:38.480 --> 02:40.313
the job of a lifetime!

02:40.380 --> 02:41.813
Well, I thought they said
you were too top‐heavy

02:41.880 --> 02:43.813
to be a figure skater.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.780
I'm talking about fashion.

02:46.846 --> 02:48.180
Anyway, just so happens

02:48.246 --> 02:49.813
that the boutique has been sold

02:49.880 --> 02:51.213
to Jean Luc Gerard

02:51.280 --> 02:53.080
or, as the world knows him

02:53.146 --> 02:54.446
Monsieur Luc.

02:54.513 --> 02:56.446
That guy who owns
that chichi poo‐poo boutique

02:56.513 --> 02:58.880
on Upper East Side,
that sells the $1000 socks?

02:59.913 --> 03:01.086
That's him.

03:01.153 --> 03:03.853
And now,
he's poised to conquer Downtown

03:03.920 --> 03:05.420
via my little shop.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.486
Well, what makes you think
he's poised to hire

03:07.553 --> 03:09.353
your little behind?

03:10.286 --> 03:11.420
Well, he just has to.

what she said

but I feel flattered.

You guys, I have got to get
this job with Monsieur Luc.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.720
All my life,
I've had one simple dream.

03:52.786 --> 03:55.020
To make the world
look as good as me.

03:56.786 --> 03:58.253
[scoffs]
Who am I kidding?

03:58.320 --> 03:59.953
I'll just make it
look presentable.

about my body‐double‐trouble.

04:13.926 --> 04:16.926
Shoot, why couldn't my
look‐alike be a respectable man?

04:16.993 --> 04:18.625
Or a world leader

04:18.692 --> 04:19.959
a famous athlete

04:20.026 --> 04:22.726

earth and wind to fire?

04:23.593 --> 04:25.193
Look, it could be worse.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.593

is a dead ringer

‐ Why is he ashamed of that?
‐ She's not ashamed.

to get dates.

04:44.526 --> 04:46.160
Well, thanks, baby, but

04:46.226 --> 04:48.526
unfortunately,
the Jones clan at Cleveland

04:48.593 --> 04:51.193
is not quite so perceptive.

to the homestay

with a videotape in his hand

04:56.726 --> 04:58.760
and treachery in his heart.

04:58.826 --> 05:00.193
Who's Cousin Bumpy?

05:00.260 --> 05:03.033
Uh, family member
with the unfortunate distinction

05:03.100 --> 05:05.566
of being both a pervert
and a big mouth.

05:06.566 --> 05:07.633
'By this time tomorrow'

05:07.700 --> 05:09.433

prayin' for my fallen soul.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.266
You look that much
like this mattress man?

05:18.333 --> 05:20.400
Well, in truth, we only
caught a passing glimpse.

05:20.466 --> 05:22.233
You know, it's not easy
to ask a room full of men

05:22.300 --> 05:24.900
to rewind a tape, so you can
get look at a naked brother.

05:26.266 --> 05:28.900
Then rent the video
and make sure.

05:28.966 --> 05:31.933
Kyle, take Overton
down to the video store

05:32.000 --> 05:34.533
and head straight
to the freaky‐sneaky section.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.333
<i>Tres bien.</i>

05:41.400 --> 05:44.566
I want these floors buffed
within an inch of their lives.

05:44.633 --> 05:47.000
Bop‐bop‐bop‐bop‐bop.

05:47.066 --> 05:49.033
I should be able to see
my Cheshire grin

05:49.100 --> 05:50.766
in every tile.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.166
Excuse me.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.266
Ah!

I'm in the presence of royalty.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.106
‐ Mm.
‐ Ah!

06:06.173 --> 06:07.873
A hand‐stitched sport coat

06:07.940 --> 06:11.440
made of wool from the
underbellies of Tibetan sheep.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.306
Ah, female sheep.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.673
[speaking in foreign language]

06:18.740 --> 06:21.306
Surely someone so wise
in the ways of fashion

06:21.373 --> 06:24.706
can be none other than
Regine Hunter.

06:24.773 --> 06:27.006

Oh, well, <i>merci!</i>

06:27.073 --> 06:28.506
[laughing]

06:28.573 --> 06:31.373
I had no idea
that I was so well‐known

06:31.440 --> 06:33.106
in the fashion community.

06:33.173 --> 06:36.906
You attached an eight‐by‐ten
color photograph to your resume.

06:36.973 --> 06:39.373
By the way, that stretch wig
you were wearing

06:39.440 --> 06:41.373
what a madcap touch.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.106
Well, that's me.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.106
Madcap Regine.

06:49.173 --> 06:50.806
Uh, "Madcap" is good, right?

06:50.873 --> 06:52.840
Oh‐ho‐ho, <i>sans doute.</i>

06:52.906 --> 06:54.940
We must all be a little crazy

06:55.006 --> 06:57.173
to work in this
glamorously wicked business.

06:58.373 --> 07:01.480
[laughing]
Well, heck, I‐I can be crazy.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.546
I mean, I can be
downright schizophrenic.

07:05.446 --> 07:06.780
I must warn you

07:06.846 --> 07:08.813
this new store
will be worlds away

07:08.880 --> 07:11.213
from anything you are used to.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.580
As you can see,
we are laying waste

07:12.646 --> 07:15.280
to Mary's little boutique.

07:15.346 --> 07:17.480
Oh, wow, you're even expanding

07:17.546 --> 07:19.413
into the pizza shop next door.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.313
[chuckling]
Adieu, Papa Pepperoni.

07:23.380 --> 07:27.380
Ah! The things I could do
with all that extra space.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.513
So tell me,
what kind of merchandise

07:29.580 --> 07:31.413
will you be tempting us with?

07:31.480 --> 07:33.946
[laughs]
It will be outrageous.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.480
Garments such as these

07:37.546 --> 07:38.746
will be banished.

07:38.813 --> 07:39.946
Look at that price tag, eh?

07:40.013 --> 07:41.480
‐ Two hundred dollars.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

07:41.546 --> 07:42.646
Poof.

07:43.913 --> 07:47.080
Catching people
and their wallets off guard

07:47.146 --> 07:48.280
has been my dream

07:48.346 --> 07:50.880
since I was
a well‐coiffed toddler.

07:50.946 --> 07:53.946
But when I worked for Mary,
my hands were tied.

07:54.013 --> 07:56.646
The woman even
stocked crushed velvet.

07:56.713 --> 07:58.546
Crushed velvet is in.

07:58.613 --> 08:01.353
I love crushed velvet.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.220
You know,
I could tell by your resume

08:03.286 --> 08:06.120
you are a woman of vision.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.886
Ah. Monsieur Luc

08:07.953 --> 08:09.953
I know, in my heart,
that I could work

08:10.020 --> 08:12.120
small miracles as your buyer.

08:12.186 --> 08:14.253
So do I.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.220
Unfortunately, <i>Monsieur</i> Luc
does his own buying. <i>Adieu.</i>

08:17.286 --> 08:18.620
N‐no, wait, wait, wait.

08:18.686 --> 08:20.720
Monsieur Luc,
uh, surely there must be

08:20.786 --> 08:22.586
something that I can do, huh?

08:22.653 --> 08:25.920
I mean, after all,
heh, I‐I am Madcap.

08:25.986 --> 08:27.253
[nervous chuckle]

08:27.320 --> 08:29.286
Certainly.

08:29.353 --> 08:32.720
Oh, such a dilemma
for Monsieur Luc.

08:32.785 --> 08:34.285
What to do? What to do?

08:35.352 --> 08:38.086
Oh! I am looking for a manager.

08:38.153 --> 08:41.352
I practically ran this place!

08:41.419 --> 08:44.520
Monsieur Luc, what can
I possibly say to convince you?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.920
Other than..

08:47.986 --> 08:50.920
[speaking in foreign language]

08:53.820 --> 08:56.153
Regine, you are

08:56.220 --> 08:58.020
a brazen kiss‐ass.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.726
I treasure that in a manager.

09:01.793 --> 09:03.693
Welcome to my employ.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.126
Thank you! Oh! Muah. Muah.

09:09.126 --> 09:11.260
How many of that man's videos
did you rent?

09:11.326 --> 09:12.826
Just one.

09:12.893 --> 09:14.393
Overton padded the transaction

09:14.460 --> 09:16.560
to delude
the perversion quotient.

09:17.993 --> 09:21.426
Let's see, we got a
"Herbie, The Love Bug"

09:21.493 --> 09:23.960
uh, "Fievel Goes West"

09:24.026 --> 09:26.326
uh, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks

09:26.393 --> 09:28.326
The Director's Cut.."

09:32.060 --> 09:33.560
And our feature attraction

09:33.626 --> 09:35.960
starring the one and only

09:36.026 --> 09:38.260
Nas‐s‐s‐T.

09:39.893 --> 09:42.493
‐ "Nas‐T." Never heard of him.
‐ 'Mm‐hm.'

09:42.560 --> 09:45.926
That's because
he's brand spanking new.

09:48.526 --> 09:49.726
And incidentally
that happens to be

09:49.793 --> 09:51.293
the title of the film.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.926
So, ladies

09:54.993 --> 09:56.293
and gentlemen..

09:57.393 --> 09:59.426
...it's showtime. Ah!

09:59.493 --> 10:02.066
Uh, Synclaire, you might wanna
leave the room now

10:02.133 --> 10:04.666
as to avoid
this pagan spectacle.

10:04.733 --> 10:08.166
Obie, of course not. I'm gonna
sit right here by your side.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.433
Plus, I wanna see if this is
one of the ones with a plot.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.733
[chuckling]
I can't believe I'm watching
a porno flick with my friends.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.800
‐ Just watch, there he is.
‐ Which one?

10:20.866 --> 10:22.266
The one with the baseball hat

10:22.333 --> 10:25.800
the overalls, the tool belt,
and the paddle.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.333
He's turning around...now.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.333

<i>Bienvenue.</i>

11:08.106 --> 11:10.740
Welcome to your new home!

11:11.673 --> 11:13.940
What did you do
to the boutique?

11:14.873 --> 11:17.340
Oh, my God, is that a tube top?

11:19.306 --> 11:22.506
Available
in ten fluorescent colors.

11:23.973 --> 11:26.340
But you don't sell this..

11:26.406 --> 11:28.906
...stuff in your
other New York stores.

11:28.973 --> 11:31.206
<i>Exactement.</i>

11:31.273 --> 11:33.106
This is for, uh

11:33.173 --> 11:35.340
the less discriminating.

11:35.406 --> 11:37.373
That is why I call it
"Le Rag Bin."

11:37.440 --> 11:39.006
"Le Rag Bin?"

11:39.073 --> 11:42.173
The discount chain?
It's impossible.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.340
How else you think
I keep my exclusive shops

11:44.406 --> 11:45.440
up and running?

11:45.506 --> 11:46.440
At Monsieur Luc Boutique

11:46.506 --> 11:48.140
if we sell one item a week

11:48.206 --> 11:50.373
it's considered brisk business.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.273
At Le Rag Bin, we average

11:52.340 --> 11:55.273
one sale every
twenty‐two‐and‐one‐half seconds.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.706
Cha‐ching.

11:58.140 --> 12:00.613
Try on your smock, binmaster.

12:02.446 --> 12:04.646
‐ "Binmaster?"
‐ And not to forget.

12:05.713 --> 12:07.913
Your very own pricing gun.

12:09.113 --> 12:11.046
Carry it with pride.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.846
You there,
you there, binmaster.

12:30.113 --> 12:32.113
I thought
this was a classy joint

12:32.180 --> 12:33.880
but when I went to try these on

12:33.946 --> 12:37.046
a spider crawled out
of the back pocket.

12:37.113 --> 12:40.180
Oh, then you've met
our quality control inspector.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.480
Regine, you were rude to her.

12:48.546 --> 12:49.846
Sorry.

12:49.913 --> 12:52.480
I guess the smell
of Rayon and Charlie

12:52.546 --> 12:54.613
went to my head.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.613
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Rude is good.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.253
If you are too accommodating,
the customer will suspect

13:00.320 --> 13:02.753
that these bargains
are the sham that they are.

13:02.820 --> 13:06.220
You know, um, Monsieur Luc..

13:06.286 --> 13:08.920
...I don't think
that I'm right for this job.

13:08.986 --> 13:11.386
Oh, poppycock!

13:11.453 --> 13:15.386
You are Rag Bin material
through and through.

13:15.453 --> 13:18.586
Besides, Monsieur Luc
hires no one for his boutiques

13:18.653 --> 13:20.453
who does not cut
their eyeteeth

13:20.520 --> 13:22.586
at Le Rag Bin.

13:22.653 --> 13:25.786
My original managers
are now toasting their success

13:25.853 --> 13:27.420
in gay Paris.

13:27.486 --> 13:28.786
All of 'em?

13:28.853 --> 13:30.920
All but one.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.186
Such a shame.

13:33.253 --> 13:35.386
No one thought
that she would actually jump.

13:36.353 --> 13:37.553
‐ Au revoir.
‐ W‐wait.

13:37.620 --> 13:40.786
‐ Wh‐where you going?
‐ Somewhere far, far away.

13:40.853 --> 13:42.886
If Monsieur Luc
is caught around here

13:42.953 --> 13:44.920
his reputation go poof!

13:51.020 --> 13:52.020
Am I hallucinating

13:52.086 --> 13:54.020
or is that Regine
wearing a poncho?

13:55.853 --> 13:59.086
Who cares.
They closed down Papa Pepperoni.

13:59.153 --> 14:01.826
I was one stamp short
of a free Calzone.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.060
Uh, Binmaster Reggie.

You know, when you told me
you'd be working

14:12.393 --> 14:13.626
in a chic, upscale boutique

14:13.693 --> 14:15.293
I pictured something,
oh, I don't know

14:15.360 --> 14:17.626
chic and upscale.

14:17.693 --> 14:20.660
It seems as if Monsieur Luc
neglected to tell me

14:20.726 --> 14:22.326
he also owns Le Rag Bin.

14:22.393 --> 14:24.326
It's his cash cow.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.793
And you, a binmaster?

in the trailer park.

14:38.226 --> 14:39.826
Okay, that's it!

14:39.893 --> 14:40.893
Well, now, hold up now.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.460
The shabby‐chic look
is in these days.

14:43.526 --> 14:45.460
Oh, no, this just junk.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.360
Honey, why didn't you tell me

14:55.426 --> 14:57.693
you were working
at the Le Rag Bin?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.966
Uh, I have died
and gone to heaven.

That's right, Momma Hunter.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.533
Your baby is the binmaster.

15:08.733 --> 15:12.433

That's rag‐binese for manager.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.866
Aw. My little girl has finally

15:15.933 --> 15:18.200
made something of herself.

15:31.733 --> 15:33.233

15:33.300 --> 15:36.066

of several summers ago

15:36.133 --> 15:38.666
but, uh, we thought you'd like
to hear this from friends. See‐‐

15:38.733 --> 15:41.200
See, I was visiting a client
down at Central Brooklyn today

15:41.266 --> 15:42.800
when I ran
into your buddy Nas‐T.

15:42.866 --> 15:45.266
Seems he was arrested
for exposing himself

15:45.333 --> 15:46.533
in an adult theater.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.933
Oh, that'll stop him
from making those smutty movies.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.466
‐ Oh, no‐‐
‐ No, probably not.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.633
Because Alan Dershowitz

15:51.700 --> 15:53.833
is turning it into
a First Amendment case.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.700
So look forward to seeing Nas‐T

"Jerry Springer"

with Tom Arnold, man.

to nip this in the bud.

give up like that.

16:36.306 --> 16:37.706
At what price, Khadijah?

16:37.773 --> 16:38.873
I could wake up one morning

16:38.940 --> 16:40.606
in a corduroy jumper
and saddle shoes

16:40.673 --> 16:42.673
and be okay with it.

16:43.973 --> 16:45.773
You could also wake up
on a park bench

make the rent.

any mirrors in here.

Excuse me, miss.
I need your expert opinion.

18:05.853 --> 18:08.053
Can you tell me
what goes with this?

Sure, why not?

Why can't I tell you
what goes with that, huh?

conservative partner, hmm?

leopard‐print knee pants.

18:30.053 --> 18:31.353
‐ Nice.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

18:31.420 --> 18:33.753
Now, you gotta make it sing
with accessories.

18:33.820 --> 18:37.086
How about this genuine
faux gold belt?

18:37.753 --> 18:40.353
Oh, that's good.

Wait a minute now,
you can't leave without shoes.

of any great outfit.

‐ What?
‐ Oh.

19:14.893 --> 19:17.493
I should explain,
I'm not shopping for myself.

the town slut.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.360
Ooh, I adore Bambi!

19:27.426 --> 19:29.393
And I don't think
she's so much a slut

19:29.460 --> 19:31.426
as much as she is misunderstood.

19:31.493 --> 19:33.493
Mm, well,
she has been misunderstood

19:33.560 --> 19:35.660
by virtually every character
on the show.

19:35.726 --> 19:36.826

Wow, it must be so glamorous

19:40.226 --> 19:41.926
Oh, please,
it's hard to be glamourous

when you're working
a double shift.

19:43.326 --> 19:44.560

19:44.626 --> 19:47.693

I am to replace her.

Really? Hold that thought,
let me get my resume.

together in a size‐three

Thank you, Miss Mills.

because I'm gonna remember

see me on the street

to feel the wrath..

21:19.873 --> 21:21.506
...of the binmaster.

21:24.873 --> 21:26.206
<i>(female narrator)</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

21:30.440 --> 21:32.406
Happy days are here again!

21:35.073 --> 21:37.973
Wow! You‐you're in a good mood.
Did you talk to your mom?

21:38.040 --> 21:40.540
Yep, just got off the phone.

21:40.606 --> 21:43.973
As I suspected, Cousin Bumpy
showed her the offending tape

21:44.040 --> 21:46.640
but she wasn't fooled
for a minute.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.506
Well, maybe a minute.

21:48.573 --> 21:51.473
But then,
she realized that all her sons

21:51.540 --> 21:52.906
have innies

21:52.973 --> 21:56.373
and this Nas‐T dude,
was definitely an outie.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.373
Okay.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.980
So, now, it's time to watch

22:00.046 --> 22:03.013
"Herbie,
My Favorite Volkswagen."

22:03.080 --> 22:06.180
That wacky love bug,
he's got a mind all his own.

22:06.246 --> 22:08.113
[gasping on TV]

22:09.980 --> 22:12.580
Oh. Oh. Now, this isn't
the Herbie I remember.

22:13.980 --> 22:16.113
Yeah, I don't remember
a orgy scene.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.446
Ooh.

22:19.180 --> 22:20.546
"Herbie, The Lust Bug?"

22:20.613 --> 22:21.580
[gasps]

22:23.313 --> 22:24.580
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
