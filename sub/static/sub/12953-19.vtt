00:28.525 --> 00:29.912
Mr. Sloane,

00:30.708 --> 00:34.042
welcome to Mount Inferno monastery of the vespertine order.

00:34.134 --> 00:34.794
Thank you.

00:34.933 --> 00:36.833
You will forgive us our cautions.

00:37.347 --> 00:38.292
Of course.

00:42.736 --> 00:44.016
Hunting season?

00:45.605 --> 00:47.889
Come. Father Kampinski is waiting.

01:01.786 --> 01:04.596
- Mr. Sloane.
- Father Kampinski.

01:06.091 --> 01:08.135
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

01:09.351 --> 01:10.918
What can I do for you, Mr. Sloane?

01:11.940 --> 01:16.500
Our institute is mandated to develop measures to counter terrorism.

01:16.590 --> 01:19.930
We have, of course, heard about the work you've done here,

01:20.070 --> 01:22.920
and, you know, wanted to perhaps --

01:23.021 --> 01:25.495
Our bees are not for sale.

01:25.588 --> 01:27.201
Well, of course they're not.

01:27.574 --> 01:30.814
What we wanted was your... knowledge,

01:31.374 --> 01:33.323
not your insects, per se.

01:33.929 --> 01:36.980
I understand you've bred the aggression out of them.

01:37.024 --> 01:38.877
This is not strictly true.

01:38.970 --> 01:40.201
The aggression is there.

01:40.623 --> 01:43.574
The need for it, happily, is not.

01:43.713 --> 01:46.522
Come, Mr. Sloane. I'll show you.

01:47.504 --> 01:50.742
The truth is, these bees have an exceptionally venomous sting.

01:51.162 --> 01:53.164
They're very hard to antagonize.

01:53.861 --> 01:57.559
They choose productivity over aggression. Aggression is a distraction,

01:57.604 --> 01:59.936
which is why we're able to work among the apiaries

02:00.029 --> 02:02.838
without the traditional protective garments.

02:02.934 --> 02:03.830
Remarkable.

02:03.921 --> 02:07.686
There is so very much we can learn from these exquisite beings.

02:09.369 --> 02:10.459
Fascinating.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.311
They're imbued with a kind of grace --

02:13.638 --> 02:15.491
unlike so many humans.

02:15.772 --> 02:18.341
And you've achieved that grace? How?

02:18.434 --> 02:19.952
At Monte Inferno,

02:20.185 --> 02:22.134
we're dedicated to the --

02:22.227 --> 02:24.463
the marriage of supposed opposites,

02:24.556 --> 02:26.695
amongst them man and his science, God and his miracles

02:26.835 --> 02:29.835
coming together for the profit of all.

02:30.027 --> 02:31.159
Just think about it.

02:31.390 --> 02:33.243
The right blend of genetic engineering,

02:33.411 --> 02:36.747
dietetic supplements, behavior modification, and --

02:36.838 --> 02:38.409
You could create a new species.

02:38.499 --> 02:41.928
Oh, no. No, my son. Merely a better bee.

02:42.397 --> 02:45.156
One closer to God's grand design.

02:46.606 --> 02:49.749
We even have the ability to control their body temperatures,

02:49.889 --> 02:52.795
makes the bees work harder, longer, more in synch --

02:52.886 --> 02:54.793
all for the common good.

02:57.219 --> 03:00.890
Extraordinary. Paphiopedilum khan.

03:00.935 --> 03:05.512
The rarest of lady slipper orchid species, generally thought to be extinct.

03:06.212 --> 03:07.971
Not exactly. A close cousin.

03:08.017 --> 03:12.069
No. This is the genuine article.

03:12.723 --> 03:17.922
Brought here to Italy from China by Marco Polo in 1269,

03:18.389 --> 03:20.193
a gift from Kubla Khan.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.614
And what do you want?

03:21.706 --> 03:22.938
If I might,

03:23.668 --> 03:25.952
I'd like to spend a little time here,

03:26.044 --> 03:28.758
examine your historical papers,

03:28.943 --> 03:31.704
take a cutting of your orchid.

03:31.985 --> 03:34.746
A cutting? Ha ha ha.

03:34.839 --> 03:39.655
For $50 million deposited immediately to your accounts in Vanuatu and Samoa.

03:41.666 --> 03:45.239
Yes, it's true, I have a little put away for a rainy day.

03:45.752 --> 03:48.562
The fact is, I'm uninterested in money.

03:48.701 --> 03:50.824
I'm a man of God, not a merchant.

03:53.114 --> 03:56.496
In my experience, father,

03:57.057 --> 03:59.826
the two are hard mutually exclusive.

04:01.361 --> 04:03.648
I'm so sorry you came all this way for nothing.

04:03.736 --> 04:04.491
No.

04:06.408 --> 04:08.691
I'm the one who's sorry.

04:09.672 --> 04:10.954
I'm coming home.

04:12.309 --> 04:13.397
Plan "B."

05:21.543 --> 05:23.685
Please... help me.

05:23.782 --> 05:24.674
Certainly.

05:25.468 --> 05:26.748
Anti-venom.

05:27.028 --> 05:30.602
Enough to give you a shot at actually surviving.

05:31.449 --> 05:34.968
But first -- the Rambaldi orchid formulas

05:35.107 --> 05:36.655
which you used on your bees.

05:38.945 --> 05:41.091
You go to hell.

05:41.749 --> 05:42.975
You first.

05:46.552 --> 05:48.309
Now keep both arms up like this.

05:48.402 --> 05:51.784
Yes, I know, I know. You tell me every day, thank you.

05:54.122 --> 05:55.738
They treat you like an idiot.

05:55.782 --> 05:59.880
Keep 'em up, dad. It's for your own good.

05:59.974 --> 06:03.843
Dr. Liddell said you have to follow procedure to the letter if you want to make a full recovery.

06:07.246 --> 06:09.817
I never thanked you for what you did --

06:10.517 --> 06:12.658
helping to find Liddell.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.197
You don't have to.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.015
That other charade --

06:18.770 --> 06:21.046
you pretending to be your mother -- whose idea was that?

06:22.119 --> 06:23.050
Sloane's.

06:25.104 --> 06:28.007
You were living in 1981. You were delusional.

06:28.504 --> 06:31.550
It was the only way we could get you to reveal Liddell's whereabouts.

06:36.554 --> 06:38.438
You told her, dad.

06:39.746 --> 06:42.699
You told mom you were a CIA agent.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.261
You broke protocol.

06:44.311 --> 06:46.593
That's how she stole agency secrets.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.431
I'm putting these down now.

06:50.525 --> 06:54.050
You also said you were thinking about resigning from the CIA.

06:56.481 --> 06:59.528
You would have, right, dad, if she hadn't left?

07:01.071 --> 07:03.306
I didn't like being away all the time...

07:05.803 --> 07:08.375
not  being a part of your life.

07:11.789 --> 07:13.270
You're part of it now.

07:16.486 --> 07:17.718
They're ready for the briefing.

07:17.821 --> 07:19.138
Thank you. We're coming.

07:23.656 --> 07:25.126
Yesterday a rare orchid was stolen

07:25.219 --> 07:27.656
from the Monte Inferno monastery in Umbria.

07:27.784 --> 07:29.973
45 monks were killed to obtain it.

07:30.299 --> 07:33.633
Satellite photos confirm it's the same man we encountered in Santiago,

07:35.037 --> 07:36.650
the man who claims to be me.

07:37.398 --> 07:39.156
Details are in your briefing folders.

07:39.249 --> 07:40.682
What's  so special about this orchid?

07:40.765 --> 07:44.433
It has chemical properties which heighten the receptivity in the neural pathways...

07:44.527 --> 07:47.289
we think -- we assume. Well, we don't know, really.

07:47.380 --> 07:51.241
It's just that nobody in the scientific community has laid eyes on it for centuries.

07:51.614 --> 07:53.324
We have been asked to recover it.

07:53.509 --> 07:56.317
Find the impostor. Get the orchid.

07:56.691 --> 07:59.122
I want a plan on my desk by 2200.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.466
That's it.

08:01.495 --> 08:02.680
Arvin...

08:03.754 --> 08:04.699
a word.

08:05.962 --> 08:06.811
Of course.

08:08.218 --> 08:10.878
You said it was harmless, this could never happen.

08:10.971 --> 08:12.349
I didn't know it could.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.581
I never imagined the effects of the orchid could be reversed.

08:14.674 --> 08:16.432
No. But somebody did.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.163
Let's not overreact, Jack.

08:19.353 --> 08:21.778
What we saw -- the effect of the Mueller device --

08:22.151 --> 08:24.863
was a demonstration on insects, not on humans.

08:24.954 --> 08:27.286
We are staring at the potential for global disaster,

08:27.528 --> 08:30.327
in no small part because of what you've put in place.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.373
Don't you think I realize the responsibility I bear?

08:34.868 --> 08:37.113
We need to find the orchid, Jack,

08:37.244 --> 08:40.447
not waste time arguing over what we can't change.

08:40.528 --> 08:42.030
72 hours.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.495
If we haven't recovered the orchid in that time,

08:44.633 --> 08:46.294
I'm going to Langley with this.

08:47.702 --> 08:49.310
It'll mean the end of you, Arvin.

08:49.405 --> 08:50.636
You too, jack.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.852
I know.

08:53.672 --> 08:55.143
72 hours.

09:35.019 --> 09:37.279
The italian police dead-ended on both vehicles.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.062
Satellite surveillance was a bust.

09:39.341 --> 09:40.502
Echelon's bone-dry.

09:40.605 --> 09:43.427
Apparently our Sloane Clone has vanished into the ether.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.990
- Then we're back to square one.
- Not exactly.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.740
If we can't find him, we'll make him find us.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.440
The vespertine papers --

09:49.588 --> 09:52.334
Rambaldi text that refer to our stolen orchid.

09:52.421 --> 09:54.991
Rumor is they were destroyed during World War II.

09:55.084 --> 09:56.412
You want to bring them out of hiding?

09:56.504 --> 10:00.507
Leak dummy intel that they were found in father Kampinski's personal belongings.

10:00.606 --> 10:02.692
We can get the DSR to loan us some documents.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.169
Set it up as an auction.

10:04.253 --> 10:07.062
I have a contact at the Paris antiquities house.

10:15.341 --> 10:17.338
Smile and look like a lot of money.

10:17.429 --> 10:19.765
- Dollars or Euros?
- Euros, definitely.

10:24.967 --> 10:27.905
Mark Mullins from the Carolina institute.

10:28.138 --> 10:29.322
Ah, yes.

10:30.023 --> 10:31.016
Thank you.

10:36.357 --> 10:37.921
Evergreen, you are on the air.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.622
Uplinking to A.P.O.

10:39.761 --> 10:40.804
I'd love to be there.

10:40.909 --> 10:43.083
It's too risky. The impostor's seen you before.

10:43.130 --> 10:45.140
- I know. Just --
- Nadia will do fine.

10:45.219 --> 10:46.308
Let's hope so.

10:47.196 --> 10:50.816
Sold, for 5 million euros to the man in the gray flannel suit.

10:51.732 --> 10:55.878
Our next item -- lot 47 -- is a last-minute addition.

10:56.251 --> 10:58.105
The vespertine papers.

10:58.459 --> 11:03.036
All interested bidders should take a few moments to examine the documents.

11:03.649 --> 11:06.751
Look, but, please, do not touch.

11:08.005 --> 11:09.901
Let's see who takes the bait.

11:18.462 --> 11:19.360
Identity?

11:19.792 --> 11:23.305
Toshiro Takenada. Wealthy Rambaldi collector from Kyoto.

11:28.539 --> 11:34.674
Efraim Dousseau Ngumbe. Dilettante, far more money than vision.

11:36.018 --> 11:36.962
Remarkable.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.473
I've never seen her before.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.866
Evergreen, get a look at her name tag.

11:46.466 --> 11:48.559
Pamela McNabb, Stanwyck institute.

11:48.652 --> 11:49.979
- Yowza.
- Easy.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.164
What? We can't appreciate beautiful things?

11:52.239 --> 11:54.953
No, you're right. Watch tv, can't touch the knobs.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.108
It's a dummy corp. McNabb's a phoney.

11:59.574 --> 12:02.621
We will start the bidding at 2 million euros.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.702
I have 2 million. Do I hear 2.5?

12:06.526 --> 12:09.508
2.5. Do I have 3 million?

12:10.200 --> 12:11.348
4 million?

12:12.228 --> 12:13.660
6 million?

12:14.209 --> 12:15.203
9 million?

12:16.886 --> 12:17.783
10 million?

12:17.922 --> 12:20.255
- The girl stopped bidding.
- Something went wrong.

12:20.580 --> 12:23.496
- Merlin, McNabb's cell phone.
- I'm all over it.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.854
Scanning to get a GSM source.

12:26.979 --> 12:27.928
Her conversation's encrypted.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.616
11.5?

12:31.082 --> 12:32.315
McNabb's on the move.

12:32.424 --> 12:34.069
- Stop the woman.
- Copy that.

12:35.343 --> 12:36.373
12 million?

12:36.478 --> 12:38.046
Suppose she's not working for your impostor.

12:38.179 --> 12:40.266
- No, it's her.
- Then why's she leaving?

12:40.358 --> 12:41.494
I would only stop bidding

12:41.587 --> 12:45.065
if  I was certain that I could recover the papers through some other means.

12:47.590 --> 12:49.126
13 million?

12:50.841 --> 12:53.648
She's a decoy. Outrigger, check the papers.

12:53.694 --> 12:54.573
Copy that.

13:08.847 --> 13:13.671
Evergreen, forget about her. The papers are gone. Out the back.

13:44.351 --> 13:48.163
Marcus. What a surprise.

13:51.503 --> 13:52.526
We got him.

13:53.226 --> 13:56.226
Good work. Bring him home.

13:56.981 --> 13:59.401
We'll make him tell us where the orchid is.

14:29.950 --> 14:30.711
Jack.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.831
Of course. I should have known.

14:34.568 --> 14:35.518
You know me?

14:36.120 --> 14:38.547
What kind of question is that? Of course I know you.

14:38.638 --> 14:39.709
And me?

14:39.989 --> 14:42.339
- What about you?
- Do you know me?

14:43.489 --> 14:44.443
No.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.138
I am Arvin Sloane.

14:48.442 --> 14:49.548
I see.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.640
This is your idea, Jack -- play with my sense of reality.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.398
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:55.048 --> 14:56.137
I've never met you.

14:56.951 --> 14:58.354
It's not going to work.

14:59.608 --> 15:00.815
Okay.

15:01.281 --> 15:02.866
Shall we state this for the record?

15:03.455 --> 15:05.806
I am Arvin Sloane.

15:13.552 --> 15:15.176
Posing as Arvin Sloane,

15:15.680 --> 15:19.828
you recently stole a rare orchid from the Monte Inferno monastery.

15:20.013 --> 15:22.248
Your masquerade is over. You've been caught.

15:22.529 --> 15:25.767
What happens next? You deprive me of food?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.045
Try to alter my sense of time?

15:28.181 --> 15:30.639
Childish attempts to break me down.

15:30.733 --> 15:33.447
You, Jack, of all people, should know that.

15:33.554 --> 15:34.963
Who are you?

15:35.103 --> 15:36.307
Who am I?

15:38.253 --> 15:39.452
1985.

15:40.044 --> 15:40.989
Belize.

15:41.643 --> 15:47.320
For 72 hours, we were stuck in a safe house questioning a revolutionary.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.689
And after you cut off --

15:50.286 --> 15:52.236
how many fingers was it? --

15:52.750 --> 15:53.551
Eight...

15:55.777 --> 15:57.391
He told us what we wanted.

15:58.467 --> 16:00.224
Only you and I know that.

16:00.738 --> 16:03.357
You left it off the after-action report.

16:03.450 --> 16:06.690
How desperate the company must be to play this pitiable mind game.

16:06.828 --> 16:08.990
Think you could call this... actor,

16:09.350 --> 16:13.585
this -- this clown Arvin Sloane and make me doubt my own identity?

16:13.726 --> 16:17.411
Tell me, how do you account for the fact that in the recent past, this man

16:17.695 --> 16:21.392
created and ran an international relief agency called OMNIFAM?

16:21.484 --> 16:24.819
The world knows his face as Arvin Sloane.

16:26.189 --> 16:30.896
He's a CIA stooge with my good looks, and I can prove it.

16:31.002 --> 16:32.577
The affair in Santiago --

16:32.660 --> 16:36.843
I noticed that both Marcus Dixon and Sydney Bristow were in on that mission.

16:36.984 --> 16:40.142
It beggars reason to believe that these same two agents

16:40.288 --> 16:46.291
would ever agree to work for the man who killed their loved ones.

16:46.371 --> 16:48.993
What's the most logical scenario?

16:49.297 --> 16:51.628
That I'm the impostor...

16:52.797 --> 16:54.602
or that you are?

17:01.104 --> 17:02.291
This is weird.

17:02.476 --> 17:04.282
Unless you have something better to offer,

17:04.382 --> 17:08.236
either start cutting off my fingers, or kindly call my lawyer.

17:11.276 --> 17:12.699
Marshall would like to see you.

17:12.839 --> 17:15.839
- Tell him I say hello.
- Try not to kill him.

17:19.441 --> 17:20.387
What have we got?

17:20.529 --> 17:23.344
Oh, hey, uh, I think you should see for yourself.

17:23.488 --> 17:24.682
What am I looking at?

17:24.846 --> 17:29.189
Well, these are the impostor's EEG readings, his brain activity.

17:29.277 --> 17:31.707
Basically every individual has a unique brain pattern,

17:31.796 --> 17:34.800
a signature, and -- take a look at this other one.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.374
- They're identical.
- Exactly.

17:38.484 --> 17:40.464
- Whose EEG is this?
- Well, that's the weird part.

17:40.555 --> 17:42.342
I pulled these from the CIA's database.

17:42.733 --> 17:45.830
This is Arvin Sloane. The real Sloane. Our Sloane.

17:45.971 --> 17:48.094
You're telling me these two men share identical brains?

17:48.183 --> 17:50.424
For all intents and purposes, well, yes.

17:50.723 --> 17:53.031
I mean, this man is Arvin Sloane.

17:53.123 --> 17:55.663
- At least his brain is.
- How is that possible?

17:55.739 --> 17:57.522
Back at SD-6, I worked on a project

17:57.608 --> 18:00.026
that focused on brain imprinting -- engram encoding.

18:00.111 --> 18:03.637
That program was run out of psy-ops by McCullough.

18:04.478 --> 18:05.518
Who's McCullough?

18:06.476 --> 18:09.384
Calvin McCullough, senior partner at SD-6.

18:09.695 --> 18:12.655
He headed the psychological warfare and operations division.

18:12.779 --> 18:14.777
Among the numerous programs he oversaw

18:14.868 --> 18:17.151
was something called Project Brainstorm.

18:17.524 --> 18:22.275
Its purpose -- to explore experimental technologies to aid in interrogation,

18:22.368 --> 18:25.463
brainwashing, the creation of sleeper agents,

18:25.605 --> 18:28.987
as well as the transfer of memories from one subject to another.

18:29.079 --> 18:30.455
This is what we think happened to this man?

18:30.565 --> 18:32.115
He was made to believe he's Sloane?

18:32.229 --> 18:34.611
Not just believe, but to act.

18:34.727 --> 18:37.202
Among other things, he shares the same desires,

18:37.294 --> 18:39.531
which explains his pursuit of Rambaldi artifacts.

18:39.623 --> 18:40.673
Well, if you think about it,

18:40.758 --> 18:43.423
this guy's been able to stay two steps ahead of us the entire time.

18:43.518 --> 18:47.998
He thinks like you, he knows your strategies, your playbooks, your secrets.

18:48.092 --> 18:50.854
When we were in Santiago going after Sloane Clone the first time,

18:50.993 --> 18:54.580
you knew the access code to his facility -- "Jacquelyn."

18:54.660 --> 18:57.707
I had no reference for that. It just came to me.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.480
Probably because it's buried deep inside your subconscious,

19:00.746 --> 19:04.159
which also means it's buried inside his.

19:04.251 --> 19:07.252
But  you said the were only experimental technologies at the time.

19:07.392 --> 19:11.702
So someone must have continued McCullough's research after SD-6 was taken down.

19:11.781 --> 19:14.586
McCullough was tipped off to the raid. He evaded capture.

19:14.678 --> 19:16.895
- Who tipped him?
- I did.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.052
I owed him a favor, one he clearly didn't return to me.

19:21.192 --> 19:24.049
If McCullough is holding the strings, then we may have a lead on the orchid.

19:24.142 --> 19:25.984
I have a good idea where he might be.

19:26.070 --> 19:27.692
I'll put Dixon and Vaughn on McCullough.

19:27.779 --> 19:30.013
In the meantime, we continue the interrogation here.

19:48.965 --> 19:50.582
I see you're enjoying your retirement.

19:51.044 --> 19:52.661
Don't mind if we join you, do you?

19:56.803 --> 19:59.231
It's been a long time, Mr. Dixon.

19:59.464 --> 20:03.197
To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?

20:03.461 --> 20:05.093
Arvin Sloane sent us.

20:05.964 --> 20:07.886
The real Arvin Sloane.

20:10.073 --> 20:13.921
Tell us where the orchid is, and we might be able to cut you a deal.

20:15.447 --> 20:17.453
I don't know where it is.

20:19.502 --> 20:21.620
Listen to me. If you don't want to spend the rest of your life

20:21.700 --> 20:24.879
in a federal prison, I suggest you start cooperating with us now.

20:25.674 --> 20:28.974
And I am telling you I don't have the answers you're looking for.

20:29.009 --> 20:31.591
We know you used Project Brainstorm technology

20:31.672 --> 20:34.595
to make that man believe he's Arvin Sloane.

20:34.672 --> 20:36.476
And I'm not denying that.

20:36.599 --> 20:38.869
You had him acquire the orchid for you.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.282
Where is it?

20:42.050 --> 20:43.951
Yes.

20:44.239 --> 20:46.389
I made him believe he's Sloane.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.551
But I did too good a job.

20:48.986 --> 20:52.019
He double-crossed me and kept the orchid for himself.

20:52.346 --> 20:55.748
Just like Arvin would have done.

20:56.067 --> 20:57.485
You're lying.

20:58.694 --> 21:00.982
I'm beyond lying.

21:01.865 --> 21:03.767
All that really matters now

21:03.859 --> 21:07.927
is that my employer would never let me live long enough

21:08.192 --> 21:12.101
to be interrogated, and that right now

21:12.300 --> 21:17.921
I have 300 milligrams of cyanide coursing through my veins.

21:18.009 --> 21:20.081
- The coffee!
- Get an ambulance.

21:21.134 --> 21:22.235
Who are you working for?

21:23.422 --> 21:26.357
Tell Arvin I --

21:39.971 --> 21:41.640
I'm so happy to see you, Sydney.

21:44.230 --> 21:46.204
I have only one question to ask you.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.935
Where's the orchid?

21:49.049 --> 21:52.149
Four years is a long time not to see someone you love.

21:55.266 --> 21:56.587
It appears you've done well.

21:57.053 --> 21:59.149
Look, if you want to tell me where to find the orchid,

21:59.239 --> 22:01.256
I'll be happy to continue this farce.

22:01.890 --> 22:02.946
Otherwise...

22:03.024 --> 22:04.889
Are you sure that's what you want, Sydney?

22:04.971 --> 22:09.551
Think about it. There are so many things you could ask of me.

22:10.389 --> 22:12.638
Why not choose one that matters?

22:13.684 --> 22:14.696
Such as?

22:19.403 --> 22:24.856
The reengineering of the evolution of the species.

22:25.088 --> 22:27.644
You found an application for one of Rambaldi's formulas.

22:27.784 --> 22:28.873
Mm-hmm. Finally.

22:28.994 --> 22:33.474
I'm the first to admit that some of Rambaldi's quests occasionally

22:33.663 --> 22:37.836
degenerated into sheer foly, but not this one.

22:39.282 --> 22:40.169
Go on.

22:40.982 --> 22:44.433
The work we did -- the work you do now --

22:44.757 --> 22:47.382
taking down bad guys, putting out fires --

22:47.549 --> 22:50.209
you're a beat cop. Not making a dent.

22:50.353 --> 22:54.114
You've got to go to the source -- human nature itself.

22:54.659 --> 22:56.173
Where we are headed.

22:56.267 --> 22:58.789
What will become of human beings.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.330
You want to change the world?

23:01.416 --> 23:06.577
You want to really deal in the vanquishing of evil

23:06.658 --> 23:08.747
and the ascendency of good?

23:08.961 --> 23:10.549
Well, I'm your guy.

23:10.752 --> 23:12.444
You're telling me you're one of the good guys?

23:12.538 --> 23:13.584
Come work with me.

23:13.673 --> 23:17.114
This work -- would it involve genetics and bioengineering?

23:17.195 --> 23:18.045
In part.

23:18.674 --> 23:21.941
A vulgarian would use the word "mutate,"

23:22.033 --> 23:24.128
but it has such negative connotations.

23:24.266 --> 23:25.834
Mutate into what?

23:25.926 --> 23:29.142
Ostensibly into a more evolved, less aggressive being --

23:29.637 --> 23:31.031
you know, cooperative, calmer.

23:31.195 --> 23:33.956
Easier to control, like the bees at the monastery.

23:34.082 --> 23:35.520
You turned them into killers.

23:35.613 --> 23:36.799
The bees were a test.

23:37.031 --> 23:38.746
I wanted to see if what goes down could come up, so to speak.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.569
Oh, come on, Sydney.

23:41.777 --> 23:43.572
How many wars were there last century?

23:43.748 --> 23:48.184
And how many people died in those wars through genocide or political repression?

23:48.601 --> 23:51.125
We're disgusting, humans.

23:52.076 --> 23:57.752
Do we learn from grace or beauty or what we call God?

23:58.016 --> 23:59.487
What were you gonna do about it?

23:59.696 --> 24:05.121
Suppose one could administer a formula to the general population

24:05.813 --> 24:10.410
that would quietly alter our brain chemistry,

24:11.184 --> 24:16.479
exponentially expanding our capacity for qualities like empathy

24:16.993 --> 24:18.944
and harmonic coexistence.

24:20.735 --> 24:26.827
This formula -- how would you administer it?

24:29.305 --> 24:30.669
Nothing could be more simple.

24:34.691 --> 24:38.574
Do you have any idea how many additives are in our drinking water?

24:44.586 --> 24:47.494
If I could undo what I did, I would.

24:48.473 --> 24:52.409
The truth is, through OMNIFAM I introduced a combination of substances

24:52.662 --> 24:54.324
into water supplies throughout the world.

24:55.036 --> 24:57.978
It was my intent, based on Rambaldi's formulas,

24:58.538 --> 25:00.687
to create a more peaceful species.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.344
To breed the aggression out of the population

25:04.429 --> 25:06.407
just as the monks had done with their bees.

25:06.501 --> 25:08.452
We don't have time for your rationalizations.

25:08.543 --> 25:09.633
- No --
- Excuse me.

25:09.789 --> 25:12.134
I'm assuming that you failed, right?

25:12.898 --> 25:13.988
Yes, I failed.

25:15.504 --> 25:16.971
Because I didn't have the orchid,

25:17.655 --> 25:19.990
I attempted to artificially manufacture its nectar.

25:20.375 --> 25:22.023
Because your impostor already has the orchid,

25:22.168 --> 25:25.117
he doesn't need to acquire any of the other substances you mentioned.

25:25.863 --> 25:29.105
All he has to do is put the nectar into the water you contaminated.

25:29.430 --> 25:30.662
You loaded the gun.

25:31.082 --> 25:32.678
That's right.

25:32.789 --> 25:34.315
How many people are we talking about?

25:34.447 --> 25:36.590
How many people drank the contaminated water?

25:36.978 --> 25:39.054
Somewhere between 300 and 400 million.

25:40.222 --> 25:40.900
What?

25:41.021 --> 25:42.492
Assuming the impostor's organization

25:42.632 --> 25:45.211
is already harvesting the chemical from inside that orchid,

25:45.389 --> 25:48.772
I suggest we not waste time on accusations right now.

25:50.877 --> 25:52.037
What are the options?

25:52.294 --> 25:54.470
Dixon and Vaughn are uplinking all of McCullough's files.

25:55.148 --> 25:56.463
There might be a lead in there.

25:56.602 --> 25:58.553
Divide it up. See what you can find.

26:04.072 --> 26:05.145
I'd like to talk to you.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.599
I saw it on your face. You knew.

26:12.019 --> 26:13.660
You knew what he did, and you ignored it.

26:13.913 --> 26:15.212
- I want to know why.
- Sydney --

26:15.299 --> 26:16.710
He's sick, dad. Can't you see that?

26:16.802 --> 26:18.594
He was at the height of his obsession with Rambaldi,

26:18.701 --> 26:20.080
but he abandoned his scheme.

26:20.591 --> 26:21.441
You still trust him.

26:21.535 --> 26:23.324
I trust that when he laid the seeds for this crisis,

26:23.395 --> 26:24.573
he thought he was doing something good,

26:24.792 --> 26:27.328
that he didn't see this as a trigger for global genocide.

26:27.683 --> 26:30.710
So he's simply a delusional megalomaniac with benign intentions?

26:30.916 --> 26:32.820
Sydney, what Sloane did cannot be undone.

26:32.979 --> 26:34.955
To alert the public would be worse than useless.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.344
It would create worldwide panic. We need that flower.

26:38.670 --> 26:42.300
Which we could have recovered long ago and turned over to the DSR for safe keeping,

26:42.387 --> 26:45.395
but we didn't, because you sat on what you knew,

26:45.733 --> 26:47.329
which makes you as guilty as he is.

26:49.983 --> 26:50.836
Yes, Marshall?

26:50.995 --> 26:52.062
I think I found something.

26:52.308 --> 26:54.073
Okay, from what I was able to get from McCullough's files,

26:54.147 --> 26:57.002
SD-6 performed detailed brain scans on Sloane.

26:57.142 --> 27:00.592
McCullough then recreated Sloane's brain digitally

27:00.677 --> 27:01.931
and then uploaded it to this guy.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.251
I mean, those files -- they're ingrained deep.

27:04.755 --> 27:06.478
Which leaves us very few options.

27:07.318 --> 27:09.028
He'll never give us the location of the orchid

27:09.168 --> 27:11.193
as long as he still believes that he's me.

27:11.305 --> 27:13.448
That's right. We'll have to shock it out of him --

27:13.632 --> 27:15.294
you know, split it off from his dual persona

27:15.448 --> 27:17.985
and then get his real personality to tell us where the orchid is.

27:18.311 --> 27:21.133
- Are we talking shock therapy?
- No, not in the traditional sense.

27:21.468 --> 27:22.613
According to the research,

27:22.787 --> 27:24.021
reliving a painful memory

27:24.191 --> 27:27.146
or a tragic experience will literally shake his moorings,

27:27.310 --> 27:28.688
but  has to be something really bad.

27:28.873 --> 27:30.644
It can't be, you know, like, "I'm sorry --"

27:30.677 --> 27:32.970
Hypnotic regression. Take him back to a point in the past and --

27:33.057 --> 27:35.961
your past -- and make him recall the memory.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.000
Arvin Clone? He'll probably resist that.

27:38.387 --> 27:42.549
You would have to relive a painful memory.

27:42.758 --> 27:44.612
And then record it using McCullough's technology,

27:45.551 --> 27:47.366
and then upload it to Sloane II.

27:47.402 --> 27:49.820
You know, it's kind of like throwing a switch.

27:49.977 --> 27:53.183
One second he's Arvin Clone, and then shazam, he's himself again.

27:53.572 --> 27:54.447
What are the risks?

27:54.842 --> 27:57.941
To the subject? I'm not sure. It'll either break him down or not.

27:58.031 --> 27:58.897
What about to him?

27:59.055 --> 27:59.634
The thing is,

27:59.724 --> 28:02.582
I'm gonna need a little bit more time to run some tests before I synthesize, so --

28:02.768 --> 28:03.888
No.

28:05.728 --> 28:06.353
We do it now.

28:07.132 --> 28:07.792
Fine.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.142
Where do we begin?

28:11.020 --> 28:12.040
Jacquelyn.

28:15.487 --> 28:16.591
Who's Jacquelyn?

28:18.180 --> 28:20.931
- 30 years ago, I --
- No! Don't.

28:21.004 --> 28:22.365
Sorry, sir. It's just --

28:22.689 --> 28:25.722
it's better if you experience it in the moment. Don't verbalize.

28:26.345 --> 28:29.039
Okay, now, this should help you feel nice and relaxed.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.774
Once you're semi-conscious,

28:30.958 --> 28:34.780
the electrodes will administer small pulses to put you into a hypnotic state.

28:35.423 --> 28:38.586
I'm going to need some help accessing Jacquelyn.

28:38.942 --> 28:41.212
Right. Mr. Bristow will speak to you through your ear bugs.

28:41.908 --> 28:43.871
He'll administer certain verbal cues

28:44.213 --> 28:46.363
which should bring your mind into the right place.

28:46.528 --> 28:48.266
- I see.
- Okay. Good luck.

29:06.968 --> 29:12.777
We are ready to record his experience. You're on.

29:13.410 --> 29:16.066
Arvin, I'm going to count back from 10 to 1.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.123
When I get to 1,

29:18.241 --> 29:21.057
you'll be in a place where you can tell me about Jacquelyn.

29:21.450 --> 29:24.595
10... 9... 8...

29:26.278 --> 29:27.160
What was that?

29:27.248 --> 29:27.960
He's fighting it.

29:28.047 --> 29:30.865
He doesn't want to go back to Jacquelyn. Keep going.

29:31.063 --> 29:33.060
7... 6...

29:33.668 --> 29:35.774
5... 4...

29:36.041 --> 29:40.048
3... 2... 1.

29:58.311 --> 30:01.229
I thought we could take the boat before it gets too cold.

30:02.182 --> 30:06.312
Perhaps have lunch in Bellagio, hmm? What do you think?

30:06.685 --> 30:08.037
I like just being here.

30:09.480 --> 30:14.477
You can see the wind in the trees. Maybe you should go.

30:14.986 --> 30:16.556
No, no.

30:17.412 --> 30:19.582
No, we can sit here for as long as you like.

30:20.539 --> 30:21.821
For as long as you need.

30:23.799 --> 30:29.155
And I promise you we will get past Jacquelyn.

30:32.380 --> 30:36.671
I don't want to hear that name. You can't say it, Arvin.

30:36.858 --> 30:38.916
It hurts too much.

30:40.538 --> 30:44.639
Will you promise me that? You won't speak her name again?

30:46.135 --> 30:49.089
Never say... her name.

30:50.070 --> 30:52.422
Let me in, Emily, please.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.833
I'm alone in this, Arvin.

30:57.210 --> 31:00.136
Right now I am alone.

31:00.302 --> 31:01.135
No.

31:04.557 --> 31:05.420
Jacquelyn.

31:05.656 --> 31:08.127
Jacquelyn. Could she have been a mistress?

31:12.758 --> 31:13.482
Please.

31:14.732 --> 31:16.414
Wait a minute. Look at this.

31:16.528 --> 31:17.821
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

31:18.463 --> 31:21.288
Arvin, we're not quite there yet. You need to go back.

31:23.097 --> 31:26.404
Who is Jacquelyn, Arvin? Go back to when you met her.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.340
You're supposed to be doing exactly nothing.

31:45.619 --> 31:46.837
And that means not gardening.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.149
It's the nesting instinct. I can't help it.

31:53.955 --> 31:54.998
Emily...

31:55.603 --> 31:57.100
please.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.931
Please, no more funny names of italian villages.

32:01.584 --> 32:05.161
We can't have a daughter named Carlotta, Tabanabia,

32:05.329 --> 32:07.023
or Fabina.

32:07.335 --> 32:09.236
Fabina. That name is perfect.

32:10.983 --> 32:13.752
How about Jacquelyn? Hmm?

32:16.773 --> 32:18.004
Jacquelyn.

32:20.391 --> 32:21.507
Yeah.

32:22.795 --> 32:24.190
Do you like it? Ha ha ha.

32:24.910 --> 32:25.950
Baby Jacquelyn.

32:26.519 --> 32:28.804
Jacquelyn. I like that.

32:30.535 --> 32:31.642
Baby Jacquelyn.

32:32.838 --> 32:34.358
Dad, did you have any idea?

32:35.053 --> 32:36.104
Sloane's numbers are wild.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.656
His beta brainwaves are cycling at 14 per second,

32:38.758 --> 32:41.138
and he's releasing massive amounts of glycine onto the motoneurons.

32:41.231 --> 32:42.465
We have to bring him out.

32:42.613 --> 32:44.267
Do we have enough? Enough to confront the impostor?

32:44.359 --> 32:45.171
No, not yet.

32:46.372 --> 32:47.242
Arvin...

32:48.096 --> 32:49.203
keep going.

32:49.278 --> 32:50.636
What happened to Jacquelyn?

32:54.098 --> 32:55.154
How is she?

33:03.015 --> 33:03.674
No.

33:05.614 --> 33:09.073
No, no... no, please, Arvin.

33:09.149 --> 33:11.413
It's a mistake. Please, no.

33:13.022 --> 33:15.459
No, no, Arvin, please.

33:15.635 --> 33:17.855
Listen to me. This was a risky pregnancy.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.590
And she fought.

33:22.105 --> 33:23.977
She tried so hard to stay with us.

33:24.609 --> 33:26.152
It was too much. Her heart couldn't --

33:26.227 --> 33:27.535
No, no...

33:29.565 --> 33:30.791
My baby!

33:40.676 --> 33:41.429
Emily...

33:53.101 --> 33:55.221
Oh, my baby...

33:58.678 --> 33:59.624
I'm sorry.

34:00.342 --> 34:01.412
I'm so sorry.

34:07.543 --> 34:08.210
No.

34:10.239 --> 34:12.065
Guys... that's it.

34:13.002 --> 34:14.802
We have enough to break down the impostor.

34:16.196 --> 34:18.114
Come with me, Marshall. Bring Sloane out.

34:22.210 --> 34:25.020
Jack, please, are you really wasting our time with this?

34:25.300 --> 34:27.965
After all, it was you who taught me how to endure torture.

34:28.228 --> 34:30.250
It was your training that enabled me to get through

34:30.429 --> 34:32.524
McKenas Cole and the needles of fire.

34:33.060 --> 34:34.766
Listen to me, you pathetic freak.

34:34.953 --> 34:36.569
Even if what you're saying was true,

34:36.668 --> 34:39.356
you can be sure that I kept a few things to myself.

35:01.282 --> 35:02.281
Tell us your name.

35:06.907 --> 35:07.758
My name --

35:08.789 --> 35:09.657
Ned Bolger.

35:11.020 --> 35:11.828
Corporal.

35:12.554 --> 35:13.607
U.S. Army.

35:14.178 --> 35:16.790
Serial number 112762.

35:17.047 --> 35:18.487
Where's the orchid?

35:22.914 --> 35:23.983
Who are you?

35:24.075 --> 35:26.220
Corporal, where's the flower?

35:30.341 --> 35:31.680
At a warehouse.

35:32.155 --> 35:33.531
Ugano, Switzerland.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.984
43 Paseo Mantello.

35:39.406 --> 35:40.563
Damn you, Jack!

35:40.683 --> 35:42.679
I always knew you were a traitor, and you turn me in?

35:42.749 --> 35:44.859
Sydney, please. Please don't let him do this.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.522
I'm Ned Bolger.

35:47.172 --> 35:49.168
I'm from Torch Lake, Michigan.

35:50.295 --> 35:52.514
You can't torture POWs.

35:53.249 --> 35:55.032
Geneva convention.

35:57.418 --> 35:59.183
Who a-- who am --

35:59.549 --> 36:01.862
Who am I? Who are you?

36:02.214 --> 36:04.281
Who -- who are you?

36:05.309 --> 36:06.591
There's a problem.

36:07.510 --> 36:08.882
It's Sloane. He's not coming back.

36:08.962 --> 36:11.274
I'm trying to bring himout of it, but he's fighting it.

36:11.698 --> 36:12.856
I mean, he's supposed to be waking up.

36:29.151 --> 36:29.741
Honey...

36:32.483 --> 36:33.561
is everything okay?

36:36.901 --> 36:37.608
Yeah.

36:39.339 --> 36:40.237
Yeah.

36:42.902 --> 36:44.465
Everything is wonderful.

36:45.994 --> 36:47.006
Take a look right here.

36:47.099 --> 36:49.436
You see that spike right there? That's his serotonin release.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.805
You know, like a please center.

36:51.056 --> 36:54.420
It mirrors the exact reaction he had at the time of Emily's pregnancy.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.893
He's there right now. He's stuck there. He's kind of in that state.

36:58.071 --> 36:59.073
Can't we just wake him up?

36:59.166 --> 37:01.122
You saw what happened to Bolger, and the shock could kill him.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.037
Right. Think of it like in computer terms.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.228
You can't just force-quit. We have to reboot his brain.

37:05.505 --> 37:06.282
How?

37:06.773 --> 37:07.626
Beats me.

37:07.998 --> 37:10.376
What if one us tried to guide him back the way that Jack

37:10.423 --> 37:13.576
was able to prompt some of my father's memories by talking to him?

37:13.921 --> 37:14.791
Well, it could work.

37:15.353 --> 37:17.138
But it also could kill him.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.796
You know, serotonin overload.

37:18.954 --> 37:21.246
I mean, he could die of happiness -- literally.

37:21.918 --> 37:23.607
- You have a better idea?
- No.

37:24.641 --> 37:25.366
Let's get started.

37:28.319 --> 37:30.260
Okay, he can hear you now.

37:32.695 --> 37:33.312
Hi, dad.

37:35.506 --> 37:36.411
Keep going.

37:36.728 --> 37:39.836
Dad, it's me. Nadia. Your daughter.

37:42.926 --> 37:47.862
You know that nice lady in the little store in town, Angelina?

37:48.020 --> 37:48.658
Uh-huh.

37:49.117 --> 37:53.337
She told me that she didn't approve of the way I was dressing Jacquelyn.

37:53.531 --> 37:54.462
Dad?

37:57.363 --> 38:00.073
- Who's that?
- She's a very lovely girl.

38:01.327 --> 38:02.799
She's my...

38:04.738 --> 38:06.056
she's my Nadia.

38:07.175 --> 38:09.224
You can't stay here, dad. I'm sorry.

38:11.655 --> 38:12.739
I'm happy here.

38:12.836 --> 38:14.646
You may be, but your work isn't done.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.144
What a beautiful girl you are.

38:19.997 --> 38:21.197
How proud you make me.

38:23.032 --> 38:26.494
But I can't come with you. The terrible things I've done.

38:27.147 --> 38:28.556
That's why you have to.

38:29.452 --> 38:31.568
Why don't you stay here with us?

38:34.257 --> 38:36.732
Stay here with us. Nadia...

38:38.641 --> 38:42.118
Stay with us, darling. We're family.

38:43.456 --> 38:46.952
Emily and Jacquelyn are gone, and you have to let them go.

38:47.647 --> 38:49.794
I will never let them go again.

38:50.068 --> 38:50.881
No.

38:52.888 --> 38:54.617
They're already gone.

39:00.752 --> 39:02.082
What did you do?

39:05.016 --> 39:06.469
I was a good man once.

39:07.609 --> 39:08.782
Now I'm a monster.

39:09.723 --> 39:13.014
And monsters cannot be allowed in this world.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.295
Yes, you were once a good man.

39:15.690 --> 39:16.775
I believe it.

39:17.291 --> 39:18.619
And you can be again.

39:19.415 --> 39:21.876
But you have to undo what you've set in motion.

39:22.589 --> 39:24.763
You have not earned the right to rest.

39:24.943 --> 39:26.375
I'm tired, Nadia.

39:27.053 --> 39:28.301
I am tired,

39:29.564 --> 39:31.270
and I am ashamed.

39:33.341 --> 39:34.565
Then there's hope.

39:34.844 --> 39:36.506
Come back and redeem yourself.

39:41.412 --> 39:43.721
It's so beautiful here.

39:44.968 --> 39:46.284
But it's not real.

39:47.981 --> 39:49.849
Be brave. Come back with me.

39:51.048 --> 39:53.168
Show me who you are deep down.

39:54.590 --> 39:56.098
I believe in you.

39:56.435 --> 39:59.299
Please, do not betray that belief.

40:00.374 --> 40:02.031
Do not betray it again.

40:08.648 --> 40:09.569
Goodbye.

40:10.882 --> 40:13.221
No. Don't go. Dad --

40:13.682 --> 40:14.197
Uhh!

40:18.456 --> 40:18.953
Dad.

40:45.521 --> 40:47.135
The first time I heard the name Rambaldi,

40:47.714 --> 40:49.667
I was working with the army corps of engineers.

40:50.642 --> 40:53.430
It meant nothing to me -- his life, his works.

40:54.715 --> 40:56.377
It was simply a curiosity.

40:58.343 --> 40:59.923
Something I quickly set aside.

41:02.462 --> 41:04.328
And then when we lost Jacquelyn...

41:07.529 --> 41:08.798
when Emily lost the baby...

41:10.483 --> 41:12.275
I felt utterly abandoned.

41:13.457 --> 41:17.451
One night I came across some of his writings that I had stored in a drawer.

41:19.285 --> 41:20.887
And somehow...

41:23.972 --> 41:25.734
it filled the hole in my heart.

41:28.124 --> 41:30.321
Oddly, it wasn't until I saw him

41:32.086 --> 41:34.935
that I realized how much of myself I had lost.

41:37.949 --> 41:40.416
I am going to rectify this, Jack.

41:41.616 --> 41:44.420
I will clean up this mess that I have made.

41:45.197 --> 41:46.800
I'd like to believe that, Arvin.

41:46.904 --> 41:47.849
But you can't.

41:48.224 --> 41:49.521
I've heard it before.

41:50.704 --> 41:51.141
Yeah.

41:52.918 --> 41:54.675
Well, Jack, all I can say is I'm trying.

41:57.698 --> 41:59.317
And every day it's a struggle.

42:04.424 --> 42:05.257
Every day.
