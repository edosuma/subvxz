00:03.004 --> 00:04.636
Do you think we should
tell them not to take a cab?

00:04.638 --> 00:06.171
Eh, let 'em make
their own mistakes.
(chuckles)

00:06.173 --> 00:07.473
Did I ever tell you,
dr. Harris,

00:07.475 --> 00:09.308
That someone once left <i>me</i>
<i>at the altar?</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:11.010
That is awful.
Yeah?

00:11.012 --> 00:13.412
And I hope he spends the rest
of his life making it up to you.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.747
Me, too.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.613
So I'm hearing we have to
amortize budget cuts

01:21.615 --> 01:23.082
Over five years.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.084
Do you want bedpans
or a surgical robot?

01:25.086 --> 01:27.152
I want both.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.154

01:39.834 --> 01:41.300
Alex.
We got a shooting.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.501
At least two other victims,
all gunshot wounds.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.869
Hey, zach,
we got a 32-year-old male,

01:43.871 --> 01:45.404
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.306
G.C.S. 15, heart rate 130.
(man) watch it. Easy.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.876
C-spine negative,
and his leg's a mess.
Excuse me?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.244
Welcome back.
Must've been some vacation.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.113
Where is my wife?
(alex) yeah.

01:54.115 --> 01:56.315
Get him to trauma!
Wait! My wife! I need to know
where my wife is!

01:56.317 --> 01:57.850
She--she's nine months pregnant.
Sir, sir, she was talking
to the police.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.384
I gotta know where she--
she seems fine.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.286
Fine? Fine? What does that mean,
she's fine?

02:01.288 --> 02:02.821
Where is she?
You need to lay back, calm down,
and let us treat you.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.189
I'm not gonna lay back.
Nick! Nick!

02:04.191 --> 02:06.191
Lucy!
Baby is kicking! I'm fine!

02:06.193 --> 02:07.726
Ha! Oh!
Pork sandwich, baby!

02:07.728 --> 02:09.862
Pork sandwich! Pork sandwich!
Pork sandwich! (laughs)

02:09.864 --> 02:12.364
That's what we say. We say
"pork sandwich," you know,

02:12.366 --> 02:14.199
'cause "I love you" is
nauseating.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.801
For sure, nick.
Here we go, guys. On three.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.336
One, two, three.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.403
Aah!

02:18.405 --> 02:20.339
Yep. Let's get in here.
Ow!

02:20.341 --> 02:22.207
(woman) vitals are unstable.
88% on 5 liters.
(nick screaming)

02:22.209 --> 02:24.543
Tachy at 120.
Get him a liter of saline.
And get some o-neg.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.145
You're in good hands there,
nick. It's all good.
(groaning)

02:26.147 --> 02:27.312
Let me at him.
Go. He's all yours.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.614
Okay, nick. Okay, nick.
Aah!

02:28.616 --> 02:30.215
All right.
(groans)

02:30.217 --> 02:32.551
Gunshot wound to the left flank.
Gonna do a f.A.S.T.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.319
Nick, can you wiggle your toes
for me?
Yeah.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.621
Good. You feel that?
Yeah.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.889
Anything I can do, guys?

02:36.891 --> 02:38.524
Yeah, I need traction on this
right now.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.925
You got it.
How was costa rica?
(nick) uhh!

02:39.927 --> 02:41.460
Hot.
Yeah?

02:41.462 --> 02:42.794
(ultrasound beeps)
no blood around the heart.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.496
Chief of surgery?
Yeah, man. It's a trip.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.398
Ow! It's my stomach!
It's my stomach!

02:46.400 --> 02:47.766
I know. Nick, we're trying
to figure it out here.
Ow!

02:47.768 --> 02:49.668
(strained voice) oh, god.
Just take it easy, pal.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.171
Spleen--f.A.S.T. Is positive.
We need to get him to the o.R.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.772
(machinery beeping)
trauma panel.
Cross and type for four units.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.908
You guys happy with that leg?
Not yet. Get him exposed.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.409
(joel) I'm on it. I'm on it.
I'm on it.
Where's lucy?

02:57.411 --> 02:58.744
(charlie) I got it.
(beeps)

02:58.746 --> 03:01.513
Aah! Ow!
(alex) okay. Okay.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.215
Aah!
Okay, his b.P.'s dropping.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.917
Ah, ah.
Bad pelvic fracture here.
Nick?

03:04.919 --> 03:06.919
It's open book.
Nick!

03:06.921 --> 03:09.354
Belt was acting as a binder.
He's tanking.
Push warm fluids wide open.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.656
You gotta give him everything.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.191
Come on, you guys.
We gotta get him to the o.R.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.525
Okay, give me
a couple of minutes.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.826
Forget the leg.
I'll help you with traction.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.361
Okay.
(beep)

03:16.363 --> 03:18.363
I need the kellys
from the chest tube tray now.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.531
There's an o.R. Free.
I'm gonna take him up.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.533
Little late to the party,
reycraft.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.968
I'm on call. It's my surgery.
He's my patient.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.536
Okay, reycraft's got this one,
all right?

03:24.538 --> 03:25.938
Just do me a favor.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.674
Fill out the trauma form
or something, please.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.942
(joel) look out!

03:29.944 --> 03:31.410
Thank you.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.813
(sighs) you know what?
You deal with it.

03:34.815 --> 03:35.948
I gotta talk to the wife.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.416
(indistinct conversations)

03:37.418 --> 03:39.284
Oh, my god. What happened?!
What happened?!

03:39.286 --> 03:40.552
W-where--where--where did they
take nick?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.688
He's on his way up
to the operating room.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.724
Okay. Is he okay? Wh--
your husband's sustained
a severe pelvic injury.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.993
His femur is broken.
He's got some internal bleeding.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.761
But we're doing everything
that we can.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.931
Oh, my god.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.434
My water just broke.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.802
Yes, it did.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.804
Okay, let's, uh,
let's sit you down. All right?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.707
Okay. Oh.
Ex-excuse me, ma'am? Can we use
your seat. Thank you.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.009
All right. Sit right there.
I'll be right back.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.477
Okay.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.813
Hey, lady having a baby.
Page labor and delivery.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.615
(labored breathing)

04:09.617 --> 04:11.450
Somebody will be here
to take care of you, okay?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.452
(lucy) okay.
This is the shooter.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.620
Kids are out there
wreaking havoc.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.455
Now I got a million cops
in the e.R.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.423
I count five. Need a hand?

04:18.425 --> 04:19.658
No. He was shot in the head.
His brain is pudding.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.993
So unless you acquired
the hand of god

04:20.995 --> 04:22.761
While you were on vacation,

04:22.763 --> 04:25.330
I'll just push saline
and keep him ventilated.
Okay, then.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.432
All right. Oh. Did, uh,

04:27.434 --> 04:29.568
Did you guys get married?
Nope.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.037
(exhales) I got divorced.
It's brutal, acrimonious.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.506
It's... I feel like
a squeezed lemon, you know?

04:34.508 --> 04:35.841
<i>(man speaking indistinctly</i>

<i>indistinctly)</i>

04:40.614 --> 04:41.780
Dr. Reid?

04:41.782 --> 04:42.981
Can I get your help
in here?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.717
Yeah.
It's good to see you.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.586
Well, I'm back and I'm bad.
What do you need, maggie?

04:47.588 --> 04:50.055
Katie over here--she's groggy,
she has stomach pain.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.291
But it's hard to tell
where or why.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.626
She's not exactly
communicative.
Right.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.461
Katie,

04:56.463 --> 04:59.498
Do you know where you are?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.300
Who brought her in?

05:01.302 --> 05:02.501
Someone must have
dropped her off.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.835
Security found her
lying outside the e.R.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.370
Mm. That's nice.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.606
Katie, do you know
what day it is?

05:07.608 --> 05:08.774
(cries) no.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.075
Did you take anything?
(inhales deeply)

05:10.077 --> 05:12.744
Drugs? Alcohol?

05:12.746 --> 05:13.812
I wanna die.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.747
You don't know what
you're saying.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.049
Don't you get it? I wanna die.
(sobs) please, I wanna die.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.450
You just need to try
to calm down.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.918
Please let me die! Please!

05:19.920 --> 05:21.653
Listen, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.422
Please let--I do. I wanna die!

Send for a tox screen.

hi, there. I'm dr. Goran.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.086
And this must be, uh, ryan.

05:54.088 --> 05:55.687
This is ryan,
and I am sonja.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.089
And I'm his mother,
and we were at the shooting.

05:57.091 --> 05:58.623
And there was bullets
flying everywhere,

05:58.625 --> 06:00.125
And some jerk trampled on him.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.094
And I have already told
two nurses

06:02.096 --> 06:05.731
And a police officer and that
freakishly handsome tall guy.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.567
I mean, what are you--
what are you doing?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.435
I am feeling for broken ribs.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.104
Ryan, do me a favor.
Take a big deep breath.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.139
Hold it.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.841
Does that hurt?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.576
(grunts) kind of.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.977
Okay.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.712
He's also--he's just,
he's allergic to penicillin

06:20.714 --> 06:22.013
And to tomatoes.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.448
All right.
Take another breath.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.751
Do you feel that?
Okay.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.586
Well, I'm gonna need to get
an x-ray to be sure,

06:27.588 --> 06:28.854
But I'm pretty certain

06:28.856 --> 06:30.989
That you don't have
any broken ribs, man.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.557
Oh, my god, thank you.
Okay. Your son's fine.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.925
Thank you, doctor.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.862
Dr. Goran,
that is great news.
Um...

06:36.864 --> 06:38.463
Let's get out of here.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.399
Okay, you're bleeding.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.666
What?
You are bleeding.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.834
Wow. Let me take a look
at that.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.169
Oh, my god.
Uh, buddy, just hop--

06:44.171 --> 06:45.604
Hop down a sec.
Thank you.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.172
It's okay.
Just take a seat up there.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.508
Yep. Just let me...

06:49.510 --> 06:50.709
Oh.
Oh, my god.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.010
You've been shot.
What?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.912
You've been shot.
(ryan) mom, are you okay?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.847
Yeah. Do--
no, mom--mommy's fine.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.149
Hey, do you not feel
any pain whatsoever here?

06:57.151 --> 06:58.884
I'm, uh, no.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.420
She's gonna be fine. There's no
obvious exit wound here.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.021
We have to get you
in x-ray right now.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.856
Okay, but now? I can't--
who's gonna take care of ryan?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.792
Because I can't--I-I can't
just leave him here.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.693
Do you have someone
you could call or...

07:08.695 --> 07:10.595
I could call my sister,
but she's, like, an hour away--

07:10.597 --> 07:12.164
I don't want aunt becca.
She's annoying.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.632
I know.
Danielle.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.900
Do me a favor.
Go to the vending machine.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.035
Get, like, um, a bag
of chips or something--

07:17.037 --> 07:18.637
I got it. It's okay.
You got it? I don't--

07:18.639 --> 07:19.838
No. No, I got it.
I'm so sorry.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.506
(sonja)
I'm here, all right?

07:21.508 --> 07:24.009
All right.
Spleen is out. (exhales)

07:24.011 --> 07:26.478
Bleeding should stop.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.646
You want to throw
your pins in?

07:27.648 --> 07:28.980
Yeah, you need to give me
a hand

07:28.982 --> 07:31.450
To stabilize the pelvis
while I remove the sheet.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.818
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

07:32.820 --> 07:34.119
Yeah.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.654
His lactic acid
is still 7.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.956
I've given him every
o-negative unit we have.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.525
He must still be bleeding
from somewhere.
Maybe retroperitoneal?

07:40.527 --> 07:41.927
No bruising on the flank.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.462
No, I don't see anything,
either.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.996
Okay, it's gotta be
on your end.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.531
Let's get the pins in,
and I'll do a pelvic packing.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.034
C-arm, please.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.708
Charlie?
Yeah.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.143
You gonna screw in
that pin or what?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.945
Yeah.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.080
(equipment beeps)
c-arm out, please. Yeah.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.249
I'm checking his labs.
Bleeding time's elevated.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.252
(whirs)

08:07.254 --> 08:08.620
He's not clotting?

08:08.622 --> 08:09.821
Could it be a drug reaction?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.757
We didn't get much history.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.927
What about natural remedies?
Homeopathic, things like that?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.262
<i>Arnica.</i>

08:17.264 --> 08:18.930
<i>I take arnica.</i>

08:18.932 --> 08:20.131
Arnica.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.566
What about arnica?

08:21.568 --> 08:23.902
Arnica, really?
That's a little obscure.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.804
There's no test for it.
Try the tranexamic acid.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.273
(equipment beeps)
arm in, please.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.175
Sats are coming up.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.843
He's stable.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.178
Nice call.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.846
You still got it.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.082
(exhales deeply)

08:37.084 --> 08:39.851
Yeah, I still do.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.686
(whirs)

08:44.824 --> 08:48.026
(indistinct conversations)

08:50.196 --> 08:51.863
I heard it went well.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.732
(exhales)

08:53.734 --> 08:55.100
You don't look like
it did.

08:55.102 --> 08:59.004
Uh, bit of the yips.
First day back and all.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.573
(exhales)

09:03.943 --> 09:05.110
You okay?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.681
I slapped a patient today.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.150
And I-I don't know
why I did it.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.552
You know, she was--

09:13.554 --> 09:14.986
She was saying
she wanted to die.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.289
She was just--
she's just a kid, charlie.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.723
I don't--

09:18.725 --> 09:20.725
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Sh--

09:20.727 --> 09:23.662
You saw a lot of people
get shot today, okay?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.931
Were you scared?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.899
Yeah.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.670
I just got my life back.
I was...

09:33.039 --> 09:35.640
I was scared.

09:35.642 --> 09:39.077
Why does this stuff
keep happening to us?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.146
I don't know.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.628
(siren wailing)

09:56.630 --> 09:58.096
(knocks on door frame)

09:58.098 --> 10:01.132
(wailing continues)

10:01.134 --> 10:03.935
I want another c.T., shahir.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.270
Why?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.238
Your last one from rehab
was clean.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.708
Yeah, I know.
I'm just, uh...

10:09.710 --> 10:12.944
I, uh... Want another one.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.347
Charlie,
you're back at work,

10:15.349 --> 10:16.948
You know?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.717
I've scanned you
up and down,

10:18.719 --> 10:20.685
From your medulla
to your peduncle.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.187
Your brain's fine.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.822
Well, what if I told you
that being back at hope zion

10:23.824 --> 10:26.091
Was giving me coma flashbacks?

10:26.093 --> 10:27.325
Mm. Well, I would say that

10:27.327 --> 10:29.728
"coma flashbacks" isn't
a neurological term.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.664
I'm feeling weird, shahir.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.700
Feeling weird.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.302
Okay.
What are your symptoms?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.371
Uh, I don't know.
Just, um...

10:39.373 --> 10:40.939
Brain-type perceptual things,

10:40.941 --> 10:45.243
Vivid thoughts
and, uh, sounds.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.646
I watch death.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.914
That's an acronym, right?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.816
It's a mnemonic
for causes of hallucinations,

10:51.818 --> 10:53.184
Which is
what you just described.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.053
Infection, withdrawal,
acute metabolic problems,

10:55.055 --> 10:57.155
Etcetera, etcetera.
I'm not hallucinating.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.131
Is that a scrip?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.002
You want me to see
a psychiatrist?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.303
Charlie, you were in a coma
for three months.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.340
Now your brain is fine,
but you're acting weird,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.743
And...
I don't do feelings.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.946
(siren wailing)

11:25.384 --> 11:26.751
(indistinct conversations)

11:26.753 --> 11:28.119
You paged me?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.754
Yeah, the patient you...

11:29.756 --> 11:32.824
I did the blood panel
and the tox screen.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.426
And?

11:34.428 --> 11:35.794
Um, her I.N.R. Is elevated,

11:35.796 --> 11:37.162
Alt and a.S.T.
Are in the thousands,

11:37.164 --> 11:40.065
And her acetaminophen levels
are 500 mics per liter.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.299
Painkiller overdose.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.701
Yeah, I gave her nac,

11:42.703 --> 11:43.868
Bolused activated charcoal,

11:43.870 --> 11:45.170
And gave her an amp
of naloxone.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.806
So what exactly do you
need my help with?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.174
Her liver is swollen.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.142
Maggie...
Where's your patient?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.444
She was just here.

11:52.446 --> 11:55.213
We need to call
a code yellow.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.981
Yeah.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.416
(p.A. Beeps)
<i>(man) code yellow...</i>

11:58.418 --> 11:59.784
He's unresponsive?

11:59.786 --> 12:01.986
B.P.'s low. 70 over 46.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.788
He lost a lot of blood,
right?

12:03.790 --> 12:06.291
Yeah. Um, tons.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.726
Okay. Hemorrhagic shock.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.861
You got a bunch of fluid
in the ambulance.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.030
2 more liters
in the trauma bay.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.231
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:13.233 --> 12:16.334
We got control of the bleeders
and, um...

12:16.336 --> 12:18.136
Fixed the pelvis
in the o.R.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.972
Ah, he's so full of saline,
he's gonna float away.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.174
Yeah? What do you think
we should do?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.777
Give him ringers
instead of saline.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.113
He should be waking up.
Do it.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.814
Yeah?

12:29.816 --> 12:32.083
Okay. (chuckles)

12:32.085 --> 12:34.285
What?

12:34.287 --> 12:35.820
No, I...

12:35.822 --> 12:37.055
I just feel like we almost
had a conversation.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.389
I mean, you asked my opinion.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.892
You used to just come in here
and bark at me.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.930
(indistinct conversations)

12:47.299 --> 12:50.335
Hey, ryan.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.070
How you doing?

12:52.072 --> 12:54.272
I need you to do
a little job for me.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.840
Okay.

12:55.842 --> 12:59.310
I have to make a speech
tonight for a fund-raiser.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.112
What's a fund-raiser?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.248
Um, a fund-raiser
is basically like

13:03.250 --> 13:06.885
A boring party for adults.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.119
Anyways, it doesn't matter.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.990
Um, I need an opening joke
for my speech.

13:11.992 --> 13:15.960
And I was wondering if you could
come up with one for me.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.862
I don't know any jokes.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.899
Everybody knows jokes.
You just gotta think a little.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.467
You reckon you can do that?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.135
Yeah.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.204
Cool.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.873
Oh, and, uh, ryan.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.241
I like to work clean.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.178
So take it easy
on the swearing, okay?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.085
(door opens)

13:42.922 --> 13:44.889
(joel) what do we got?

13:44.891 --> 13:48.393
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:48.395 --> 13:51.896
Wait. You've x-rayed
the wrong leg.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.264
I x-rayed
the right leg,

13:53.266 --> 13:54.566
Meaning the left leg.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.401
No, you--

13:56.403 --> 13:58.436
There's an entrance wound
on the left leg,

13:58.438 --> 14:00.171
And there's no exit wound...

14:00.173 --> 14:02.373
Uh, I'm sorry,
what's going on?

14:02.375 --> 14:05.043
Sonja, the bullet in your leg
appears to have vanished.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.979
What, you lost
my bullet?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.448
Well... Uh...
Yes, he lost your bullet.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.583
(motor whirring)

14:11.585 --> 14:13.218
Do you think
you should go home?

14:14.486 --> 14:15.987
It's my first day back.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.189
It's not going very well.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.924
No kidding.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.361
Aah.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.363
Maybe I had a little,
uh, I don't know,

14:25.365 --> 14:26.931
P.T.S.D. Or whatever,

14:26.933 --> 14:29.067
But I-I saw a bunch of people
get shot this morning.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.402
It's not an excuse,
I just...

14:31.404 --> 14:34.639
So... Do you think
you should go home?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.908
I'm fine.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.343
Is everything okay
with you and charlie?

14:38.345 --> 14:39.477
Maggie.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.512
I want to find our patient.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.314
I want to get her better.
Okay?

14:43.316 --> 14:45.183
Okay.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.518
You can't have
a "little" p.T.S.D.
(elevator bells dings)

14:47.520 --> 14:49.254
Can we drop this?

14:49.256 --> 14:51.456
Found her curled up
like a kitten.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.625
Thank you. Katie?

14:53.627 --> 14:55.159
You guys good?
Yeah. We're good.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.427
Katie.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.029
We need to get you
to the e.R., okay?

14:58.031 --> 14:59.297
(crying) I'm feeling
a lot better.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.132
I need to go. I have
somewhere I need to be.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.533
First we need to try to
get you off this bed.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.335
Can you stand?

15:04.337 --> 15:06.371
(object clatters)

15:06.373 --> 15:08.239
I need to get to the park.
No, honey. You're sick.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.341
You need to be in a hospital.
You hate me.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.643
No, katie,
I don't hate you.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.044
What's at the park?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.013
I want to lie down
in the grass.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.283
I don't want to wake up.
I don't want to wake up.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.651
Okay.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.152
I think I'm gonna puke.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.254
Do you see her eyes?
Yeah, she's jaundiced.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.923
Yeah. Change of plans.
I think I'm gonna puke.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.357
Let's lay you back down.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.426
Katie, we're gonna take you
straight to the I.C.U.,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.295
All right?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.297
(continues crying)

15:34.667 --> 15:36.000
Mel.
Hey, lady.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.402
This your o.D.?
Uh-huh.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.004
I'll get a nurse
to do her blood ph asap.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.406
Where's that sexy
marine biologist

15:41.408 --> 15:43.308
You promised me?
Couldn't fit him
in my carry-on.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.276
Her liver's
definitely congested, mel.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.345
Katie, I'm gonna need you
to scooch over, okay?

15:47.347 --> 15:48.680
(inhales sharply)
I don't feel good.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.248
I know you don't.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.650
Katie, we gave you a drug
called n-acetylcysteine

15:52.652 --> 15:54.218
To counteract
your drug overdose.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.687
It didn't work.
We're gonna do what we can

15:55.689 --> 15:57.588
To make you feel comfortable.
What's happening to me?

15:57.590 --> 16:00.158
We need to consider
the next steps from here.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.160
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:02.162 --> 16:06.464
"next steps"?
Uh, there are no next steps.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.700
She's in fulminant
liver failure.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.635
Unless she gets
a liver transplant

16:10.637 --> 16:12.003
In the next few hours,

16:12.005 --> 16:13.738
She'll get her wish.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.374
She'll die.

16:20.446 --> 16:22.180
Okay.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.383
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:25.385 --> 16:27.318
Is she a viable candidate
for a new liver?

16:27.320 --> 16:30.588
Yeah. She's 17 in an I.C.U.
In fulminant liver failure.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.091
One suicide attempt
won't be prejudicial.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.459
She say why she did it?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.194
No,
she didn't really say much.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.296
But there's a lot of shame.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.165
So if I had to guess,
it'd be something situational.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.568
Okay.
She's not clinically depressed,

16:43.570 --> 16:44.736
That's all I'm saying.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.270
I think that something
happened to her.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.472
Thanks.

16:47.474 --> 16:52.143
Maggie, did you find
her parents?
You have her phone.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.444
(phone buzzing and chirping)

16:53.446 --> 16:55.780
What? Sometimes
you don't see the obvious.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.082
(buzzing and chirping continue)
her mom?

16:58.084 --> 17:01.119
I hope not.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.754
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

17:02.756 --> 17:04.689
Jeez.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.059
(indistinct conversations)

17:13.165 --> 17:15.533
(exhales and clears throat)

17:19.239 --> 17:23.174
<i>I</i> knew <i>it.</i>
<i>So am I dead?</i>

17:23.176 --> 17:25.510
<i>'cause I'm--I'm feeling</i>
<i>a little ghosty.</i>

17:25.512 --> 17:28.513
(normal voice) no. You're in
a coma and you're in the I.C.U.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.349
<i>Okay, great. Great.</i>
<i>So, look, I need your help.</i>

17:31.351 --> 17:32.517
I can't--

17:35.487 --> 17:38.589
Yeah. Hey. Nick, is it?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.558
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I can't be talking</i>
<i>to you right now.</i>

17:40.560 --> 17:41.793
Uh-huh.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.461
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>So my wife is upstairs</i>

17:43.463 --> 17:46.164
<i>And she's about</i>
<i>to give birth, and, uh...</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:48.566
<i>I convinced her</i>
<i>to name our son jedi.</i>

17:48.568 --> 17:49.734
"jedi," you say?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.269
<i>Yeah, I know. I know.</i>

17:51.271 --> 17:53.204
<i>I thought it would be cool.</i>

17:53.206 --> 17:54.439
<i>Talk to her for me.</i>

17:54.441 --> 17:57.275
Here's the thing,
nick, um...

17:57.277 --> 17:58.476
You're gonna wake up soon,

17:58.478 --> 18:02.080
And you can
talk to her yourself, okay?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.815
All right. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.550
Don't call here
anymore, okay?

18:05.552 --> 18:07.351
<i>Okay.</i>

18:08.287 --> 18:10.855
"slut." "ugly." "worthless."

18:10.857 --> 18:12.857
Texts telling her
that she should die.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.760
Bully much?
No kidding.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.295
Kids can be so mean.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.131
They used to call me
"psycho maggie."

18:20.133 --> 18:21.499
Really? Why?

18:21.501 --> 18:24.669
<i>(katie) what?</i>
<i>(man) I'm just gonna</i>
<i>sit down a sec.</i>

18:24.671 --> 18:27.105
Whoa. Nelly.
What?

18:27.107 --> 18:28.272
<i>Come on. Just a little bit.</i>

18:28.274 --> 18:29.607
<i>A little bit of what?</i>

18:29.609 --> 18:31.776
<i>Take off your pants,</i>
<i>just a little bit.</i>

18:31.778 --> 18:33.144
<i>(laughs)</i>

18:33.146 --> 18:34.779
<i>Just a little bit.</i>

18:34.781 --> 18:36.447
(alex) turn it off.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.849
That is so vile.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.851
And I hit her.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.853
I literally hit her
when she was down.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.421
What do you wanna do?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.423
Put her in the system
for a liver transplant

18:45.425 --> 18:48.259
And get some genius to wipe
her sex tape off the web.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.229
Is this the <i>milf?</i>

18:51.231 --> 18:53.164
Her name is sonja.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.299
What? I'm single. I'm just
kind of working on the lingo.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.601
What do you got?
Okay.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.436
Here was the x-ray
that we took this morning,

18:58.438 --> 19:01.239
And there was an entrance wound
right there on the thigh.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.474
So where's the bullet?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.642
And...

19:04.644 --> 19:05.810
In her abdomen?
Mm-hmm.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.211
It moved?

19:07.213 --> 19:09.580
You ever seen
anything like it?
No.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.549
I mean, I've seen a lot
of grody, messed-up trauma,

19:11.551 --> 19:14.418
But usually a bullet will
kind of rattle around in there,

19:14.420 --> 19:15.820
And make some wreckage,
you know?

19:15.822 --> 19:18.589
Exactly.
Femoral vein.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.757
What?

19:19.759 --> 19:21.325
The patient got shot,

19:21.327 --> 19:22.927
And the bullet got sucked
into the femoral vein.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.562
So it's migrating
through the venous system?

19:24.564 --> 19:27.331
Tumbling through the veins
like a pebble in a river.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.768
What?
Just creating a visual.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.470
Well, at least you know
where it's going.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.805
(joel) straight to the heart.
I owe you one, man.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.374
Not keeping score.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.477
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

19:39.479 --> 19:42.647
(blows whistle)

19:42.649 --> 19:45.349
(beeping continues)

19:46.752 --> 19:48.186
<i>Dude, I'm not feeling that.</i>

19:48.188 --> 19:49.687
<i>Should--should I be</i>
<i>feeling that?</i>

19:49.689 --> 19:51.255
Hmm. Smelling salts.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.657
Sal volatile.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.960
It's not insane.
Athletes use it.
Mm.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.628
Is he a boozer?

19:57.630 --> 19:58.796
Um...

19:58.798 --> 20:00.298
<i>No.</i>
<i>No.</i>

20:00.300 --> 20:01.532
It could be
wernicke's encephalopathy.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.334
I mean, we could try
vitamin b.

20:05.737 --> 20:06.904
I grew up in a small town.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.506
I know a lot
of alcoholics.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.208
No, it's not booze,
and it's not delirium.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.944
<i>Question--can marijuana</i>
<i>put you in a coma?</i>

20:12.946 --> 20:15.313
There is some diffuse
axonal injury.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.381
You know,
in a broad sense,

20:17.383 --> 20:19.517
Prolonged coma
is an artificial state

20:19.519 --> 20:21.352
Created by medical technology.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.687
Before life-support systems,

20:22.689 --> 20:24.288
A patient like this
would not have survived.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.557
But he is here. Alive.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.559
That is strange.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.794
Yes, it is.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.596
Jackson!

20:31.598 --> 20:34.832
Push naloxone.
Page me if anything changes.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.867
<i>There's</i> the old charlie.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.736
That's... My heart.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.339
Yeah. Which is actually a pretty
safe place for a bullet,

20:41.341 --> 20:42.940
If you can believe it.

20:42.942 --> 20:46.244
Really? 'cause I don't actually
be-believe that. (huffs)

20:46.246 --> 20:48.446
You're asymptomatic, which
is great. But the problem is,

20:48.448 --> 20:50.014
That right ventricle
is opening and closing,

20:50.016 --> 20:51.649
Pumping blood every second.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.584
And that bullet
is gonna bounce on you,

20:53.586 --> 20:57.255
It's gonna head right for
your pulmonary artery.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.723
And then what?

20:58.725 --> 21:00.758
Then it'll obstruct
the blood flow to your lungs.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.727
We have to get in there
before that happens.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.894
Or what?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.763
Or you'll die.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.931
You need a sternotomy.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.499
Uh, a sternom--I-I mean,

21:08.501 --> 21:09.834
I don't--
I don't know what that is.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.002
It's open-heart surgery.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.470
Uh... (exhales)

21:12.472 --> 21:15.573
Our, um, our father
died from that.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.874
Just listen
to what she's saying.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.309
Your father probably died

21:18.311 --> 21:20.611
From complications
to open-heart surgery.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.612
Uh-huh.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.547
And how is that
any different?

21:23.549 --> 21:26.050
Why are you arguing
with the heart surgeon?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.652
I'm just trying
to understand.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.020
She's like this.
Makes drama.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.354
(scoffs)

21:30.356 --> 21:32.456
I have a bullet
in my heart, becca.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.824
You don't see me
getting shot.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.059
Ju-- (sighs)

21:35.061 --> 21:38.462
Okay. Um, give me
a plan "b."

21:38.464 --> 21:40.598
Well, option "b" could be

21:40.600 --> 21:44.068
That we take
a modified angiogram wire,

21:44.070 --> 21:46.370
We thread it up
through your femoral vein,

21:46.372 --> 21:47.705
And then into your heart,

21:47.707 --> 21:50.341
And then we would
lasso the bullet with the wire.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.509
I mean, would that work?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.477
Well, the bullet
is slippery and moving,

21:53.479 --> 21:55.346
So there's no guarantee
we that we could catch it.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.516
So your rodeo fails,
and I die?

21:58.518 --> 22:00.584
No. Then dr. Bell
would do her sternotomy.

22:00.586 --> 22:01.786
Of course.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.587
Those are your options.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.056
(laughs)

22:05.058 --> 22:07.058
Uh...

22:07.060 --> 22:08.793
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

22:08.795 --> 22:10.895
(p.A. Beeps)

22:10.897 --> 22:12.897
Rodeo.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.332
Besides, I like you better.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.334
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:16.336 --> 22:17.702
No offense.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.403
(dawn) none taken.

22:19.405 --> 22:22.540
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:22.542 --> 22:23.974
We should cut.
It's a sure thing.

22:23.976 --> 22:27.545
Dr. Bell, um, it's kind of
my bullet in there.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.046
I think we should do
the wire.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.414
It's ridiculous.
Hey. Hey.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.116
I'm--I'm also chief, so...

22:32.118 --> 22:33.818
Hmm.
You know?

22:33.820 --> 22:36.454
If it doesn't work,
we--we crack her open, right?

22:37.422 --> 22:39.690
(monitor beeping erratically)

22:39.692 --> 22:40.925
Talk to me, mel.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.360
Her creatinine level
is 400.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.527
That means her kidneys
are shutting down.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.962
I'll put her on dialysis.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.864
Her sats are dropping.
There's a liver in vancouver.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.032
That's five hours away.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.433
(coughs)
uh-oh. Dr. Reid.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.701
Yeah. She's got
internal bleeding.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.002
We're gonna need to intubate.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.904
You know what? I need a...
A blakemore tube.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.506
I have one.
Seriously?

22:55.508 --> 22:56.741
Yeah, I've been dying
to use it since med school.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.443
Uh, nurses' station,
under the desk.

22:59.445 --> 23:02.780
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

23:02.782 --> 23:03.948
Come on.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.917
Where are you?

23:06.919 --> 23:08.452
Got it!

23:11.022 --> 23:13.591
We can buy her some time.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.393
After this,
we're out of moves.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.594
There's always another move.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.095
We just haven't thought
of it yet.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.463
Okay. I'm going in.

23:19.465 --> 23:21.665
I love a hail mary.
Love it.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.502
Okay?

23:33.813 --> 23:34.812
Hey.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.680
I need a liver.
Who's dead?

23:37.916 --> 23:39.517
Well, he's the closest,

23:39.519 --> 23:41.152
Unless the cops
shot him again.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.620
(indistinct conversations)

23:42.622 --> 23:44.054
You cuff him
even though he's brain-dead?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.623
Can't be too careful.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.191
Anyway, we're waiting
for his parents to come down

23:47.193 --> 23:48.592
And okay us
to pull the plug on him.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.860
Is he an organ donor?

23:49.862 --> 23:51.796
No. He shot four people.
He's a scumbag.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.097
Did you look in his wallet?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.999
Of course I did.
You're skipping protocol.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.901
Protocol is gonna
kill my patient, zach.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.702
The nearest liver
for her is in vancouver.

23:58.704 --> 23:59.904
It's too far away.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.039
Cross type him for me, please?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.774
You'll need
the family's permission.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.910
Well, then,
page me when they come.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.511
Just don't get
your hopes up.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.813
Thank you.

24:17.490 --> 24:21.859
Sonja, I'm so sorry.
I cannot hold your hand.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.962
Oh, right.
Of course. Of course.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.799
That's stupid. I'll re-scrub.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.734
Thank you.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.136
You're in the right place
here, you know that?

24:32.138 --> 24:33.671
We're doing
everything we can.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.206
Oh, no, I know that.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.774
And it's not--it's not me
that I'm worried about.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.542
It's just that, um...

24:38.544 --> 24:41.212
I mean, I'm all that he has
in the world, right?

24:41.214 --> 24:43.714
And if I die...

24:43.716 --> 24:44.882
He's screwed, dr. Goran.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.484
Oh, I'm sure he's not.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.918
No, he is.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.553
I mean, he's just...

24:49.555 --> 24:51.121
He's the sweetest kid,
you know?

24:51.123 --> 24:57.127
And my sister,
she'll take care of him, but...

24:57.129 --> 24:58.529
(voice breaking)
she doesn't love him.

24:58.531 --> 25:02.600
And, um, his dad,
I mean...

25:02.602 --> 25:05.736
He's not
the right guy, right? So...

25:05.738 --> 25:08.172
(exhales, laughs)

25:08.174 --> 25:12.243
I don't usually hold hands
on the first date.

25:12.245 --> 25:15.079
(laughs)
yeah, me, neither.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.249
Yeah, I usually just go
right to the lying down part.

25:18.251 --> 25:22.219
But, uh, you're sober
and you have job,

25:22.221 --> 25:24.822
So I know
we're not involved.

25:24.824 --> 25:28.125
Okay. Well, I better
go scrub.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.994
It's gonna be okay.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.796
You better make it okay.

25:32.798 --> 25:35.032
(indistinct conversations)

25:35.034 --> 25:36.600
(cash register beeps)

25:36.602 --> 25:38.202
(alex) large dark.

25:39.938 --> 25:42.006
You paged me?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.173
Yes.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.542
Am I in trouble?

25:44.544 --> 25:46.810
I need your advice.

25:46.812 --> 25:49.680
Actually, not really
your advice, but, uh...

25:49.682 --> 25:50.848
Okay.

25:50.850 --> 25:55.252
(indistinct conversations
continue)

25:55.254 --> 25:56.854
I wasn't
totally honest before.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.889
Yeah.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.025
Alex, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.260
I feel really sick
about hitting that girl, maggie.

26:03.262 --> 26:06.163
Okay.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.731
Okay...

26:07.733 --> 26:09.833
Everybody thinks
that I'm this saint, you know,

26:09.835 --> 26:11.268
With what happened
to charlie.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.304
That I was, you know,
sitting by his bed

26:13.306 --> 26:17.908
And... Willing him
out of the coma or whatever.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.110
But...

26:20.112 --> 26:21.712
<i>(man) code blue, six west.</i>

26:21.714 --> 26:23.581
<i>(speaking indistinctly)</i>

26:23.583 --> 26:28.018
There's just
a couple of moments...

26:28.020 --> 26:29.353
I get it.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.756
One small moment.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.959
And I was exhausted,
and he kept getting worse,

26:34.961 --> 26:38.829
And I just thought maybe,
you know,

26:38.831 --> 26:40.664
It would be better
if he just...

26:40.666 --> 26:43.067
Went to the park
and laid down in the grass?

26:43.069 --> 26:45.836
Yes.

26:45.838 --> 26:49.206
Anyway, so when the girl said,
you know, "I want to die,"

26:49.208 --> 26:51.175
I just kind of
short-circuited and...

26:51.177 --> 26:52.977
Yeah. Look, I...

26:52.979 --> 26:56.046
I've never been through anything
really massive like that,

26:56.048 --> 26:59.750
But maybe it takes a while
for you to feel normal.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.019
Just give yourself
a little time.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.854
(charlie) alex.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.389
Hey.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.026
Hi.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.028
Mmm.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.163
What was that for?

27:13.165 --> 27:14.798
Because I can.

27:17.335 --> 27:21.305
Um, there's something I should
probably talk to you about.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.840
Okay.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.343
After work?

27:26.345 --> 27:28.779
Sounds good.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.347
See you.
<i>Hey.</i>

27:30.349 --> 27:33.684
<i>Hey, man, ho--hold up.</i>
<i>Hold up. Hold up.</i>

27:33.686 --> 27:36.420
<i>Can you--</i>
<i>wait a minute.</i>

27:37.722 --> 27:39.189
<i>You--you said</i>
<i>I would get better.</i>

27:39.191 --> 27:41.191
(exhales)

27:41.193 --> 27:42.660
We're doing our best.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.996
<i>(chuckles) so, I'm...</i>

27:45.998 --> 27:47.798
<i>I'm, uh... I'm not</i>
<i>coming out of this, am I?</i>

27:47.800 --> 27:49.333
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>
<i>And I'm...</i>

27:49.335 --> 27:51.902
<i>I'm never gonna...</i>
<i>I'm never gonna meet my son?</i>

27:51.904 --> 27:54.338
(exhales)
we don't know that, nick.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.274
Comas are... Mysterious.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.810
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Well, I got a...</i>

27:59.812 --> 28:01.879
<i>Pretty deep,</i>
<i>bad feeling about this.</i>

28:04.949 --> 28:06.950
<i>Did you talk to my wife yet?</i>

28:06.952 --> 28:08.152
Oh, come on, nick.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.287
I don't even know
if you're real.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.690
You could be
a... A hallucination,

28:12.692 --> 28:14.191
Or a-a figment
of my subconscious.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.326
<i>I'm here, okay?</i>
<i>If--if you were making me up,</i>

28:16.328 --> 28:17.928
<i>I-I would have combed my hair.</i>

28:17.930 --> 28:20.397
<i>Look, just...</i>
<i>Just tell my wife</i>

28:20.399 --> 28:24.234
<i>"jedi" is not the name, okay?</i>
<i>That's--that's it.</i>

28:24.236 --> 28:26.770
Right. So I should be willing
to seem totally crazy

28:26.772 --> 28:29.973
Because you regret
your baby name?

28:29.975 --> 28:31.442
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

28:31.444 --> 28:36.714
<i>You know, did I live my life</i>
<i>the way I wanted to?</i>

28:36.716 --> 28:38.115
<i>Well, I didn't always, okay?</i>

28:38.117 --> 28:39.450
<i>And I don't want this</i>
<i>to be my legacy.</i>

28:39.452 --> 28:41.085
It's a little weird, nick.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.854
<i>Just don't let her name</i>
<i>my boy that stupid name.</i>

28:43.856 --> 28:46.990
<i>You're the only one</i>
<i>that can help me. Please.</i>

28:46.992 --> 28:48.492
<i>Please.</i>

28:48.494 --> 28:50.027
<i>Please.</i>

28:53.198 --> 28:54.498
I can't.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.366
<i>Why not? You have a--</i>
<i>you have a gift.</i>

28:56.368 --> 29:00.003
Because if I do this, if I...
If I do this for you...

29:00.005 --> 29:02.906
That's my life from now on.
I'm talking to... Spirits.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.742
Ghosts. Whatever you are.

29:04.744 --> 29:08.412
<i>So what? What--what have</i>
<i>you got to lose?</i>

29:08.414 --> 29:11.181
My sanity.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.483
My job.

29:12.485 --> 29:15.018
My fiancée. You know,
stuff like that.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.221
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.</i>
<i>You--you're a doctor, right?</i>

29:17.223 --> 29:19.289
<i>I thought doctors--they're</i>
<i>supposed to help people,</i>

29:19.291 --> 29:20.891
<i>Aren't they?</i>
<i>People.</i>

29:20.893 --> 29:22.860
Flesh-and-blood people.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.897
(door closes)

29:26.899 --> 29:30.100
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:41.146 --> 29:43.547
I am so sorry.

29:45.083 --> 29:48.786
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
ventilator hissing)

29:48.788 --> 29:51.955
(people speaking indistinctly)

29:57.228 --> 29:59.930
The bullet caused
a catastrophic collapse

29:59.932 --> 30:02.566
Of your son's
central nervous system.

30:02.568 --> 30:05.035
He meets our criteria
for brain death.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.805
He looks
like he's breathing.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.540
He's not.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.275
The ventilator
is doing it.

30:11.277 --> 30:14.578
His heart is beating.
There's hope.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.079
Hope for what?

30:16.081 --> 30:19.283
I-I don't mean that
in a disrespectful way.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.450
What do you hope for?

30:20.452 --> 30:23.086
I c--

30:24.989 --> 30:27.324
Your son could help
a lot of people.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.593
I just...

30:29.595 --> 30:31.228
What if he wakes up?

30:31.230 --> 30:34.331
He's not going to.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.967
How can you be certain?

30:36.969 --> 30:40.103
He could save a girl's life.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.939
That I know.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.208
That's certain.

30:44.210 --> 30:47.377
You need to...
Just give me some time.

30:48.546 --> 30:51.615
Unfortunately...

30:51.617 --> 30:54.151
There isn't any.

31:04.395 --> 31:07.097
He's still my son.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.066
That's never gonna change.

31:20.111 --> 31:22.079
You ready to lasso
that bullet?
Absolutely.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.580
You know it's only
'cause she wants you, right?

31:23.582 --> 31:24.982
Who?
The    <i>milf.</i>

31:24.984 --> 31:27.284
You've been talking to zach.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.452
You should ask her out.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.087
She is my patient.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.622
That's the beauty
of being a surgeon--

31:31.624 --> 31:33.423
Once the stitches
are out--bam--you are in.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.092
You know what? Contrary to what
you might have heard, dawn,

31:35.094 --> 31:37.394
I'm not really a one-night-stand
kind of guy.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.496
Oh, right.
You hold the torch.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.465
Olympic longing.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.333
You know, it's funny,
I don't really see you married

31:43.335 --> 31:45.235
To anyone
who isn't charlie harris.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.140
(singsongy)
ride 'em, cowboy.

31:50.142 --> 31:53.310
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:56.614 --> 31:57.981
(joel) show me the heart.

31:57.983 --> 32:00.150
(dawn) watch
the tricuspid valve,

32:00.152 --> 32:01.551
Between the atrium
and the ventricle.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.220
(machine beeps)

32:04.956 --> 32:07.124
(beep)
show me
the right ventricle, please.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.159
I cannot see the wire.
She's got arrhythmia.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.527
You gotta go faster
through the heart.

32:10.529 --> 32:13.063
I have a few very difficult
turns in here, dawn.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.198
Then make them.
I will if you stop
backseat driving.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.668
Man up and I'll be a mouse.

32:17.670 --> 32:22.539
Okay. I'm just kissing it...

32:22.541 --> 32:24.074
Now. There we are.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.643
Okay, hang on a second, guys.

32:26.645 --> 32:30.013
Just gonna tighten
the noose.

32:30.015 --> 32:31.348
Okay. Keep it smooth.
Mm-hmm.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.383
Slowly.
Mm-hmm.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.718
Slowly.

32:36.321 --> 32:37.487
(clicks, beeps)

32:37.489 --> 32:39.222
Goddamn it.

32:39.224 --> 32:42.492
I lost it. Okay, uh,
I can get it back.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.628
It's in the pulmonary artery.
Yes, I can see that, dawn.
Thank you very much.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.196
(monitor beeping erratically)
okay, we gotta crack her.
Get it out.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.364
(victor) b.P. Is dropping.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.466
Heart rate is up to 110.
Sats are 85.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.068
(joel) just--
her heart rate
is all over the place.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.369
We gotta open her.
I can get it out, dawn.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.172
I just need a second to go in
and do this, all right?

32:55.174 --> 32:56.673
You can't do this.
Shut up, dawn!

32:56.675 --> 32:59.309
(machinery beeping)

32:59.311 --> 33:00.711
Step aside, please.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.479
Edna, bring that in.

33:07.385 --> 33:08.986
Okay.

33:08.988 --> 33:13.023
(beeping continues)

33:18.496 --> 33:21.031
(clicks)

33:34.512 --> 33:36.279
Yes.

33:38.583 --> 33:39.750
(clanks)

33:39.752 --> 33:43.387
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:46.691 --> 33:48.091
I'm sorry, dawn.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.292
I should not
have told you to shut up.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.161
That was really...
That was very rude.

33:51.163 --> 33:54.631
Are you kidding me?

33:54.633 --> 33:56.800
(laughs) that was great.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.469
You ever want to
have a good time

33:59.471 --> 34:02.272
With somebody you're not
in love with, you call me.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.279
(charlie) you tubed him?
Yeah.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.314
I've been increasing
the fraction of oxygen

34:11.316 --> 34:13.350
On the ventilator.
His sats keep dropping?

34:13.352 --> 34:14.518
Yeah.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.488
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

34:18.490 --> 34:20.757
It's respiratory
distress syndrome.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.060
His lungs
are filling with fluid.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.629
So I should do a chest x-ray?
Yeah.

34:25.631 --> 34:27.330
And then?

34:27.332 --> 34:30.333
Then we wait.
Some people get better.

34:31.769 --> 34:33.837
Some don't.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.143
(charlie) things haven't
been going

34:40.145 --> 34:42.312
The way we would have liked
with your husband.

34:42.314 --> 34:45.615
His injuries are putting
a huge strain on his system.

34:45.617 --> 34:49.086
Um, we're trying
to keep him oxygenated.

34:53.191 --> 34:54.491
He's not in any pain.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.793
(inhales deeply)

34:56.795 --> 34:58.361
Okay.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.766
Uh, lucy, this is--this is gonna
sound kind of strange,

35:02.768 --> 35:05.168
But, um...

35:05.170 --> 35:06.336
Nick wanted me to
talk to you

35:06.338 --> 35:08.505
About your baby's name.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.507
What? When?

35:10.509 --> 35:13.777
In the ambulance.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.113
Something about "jedi"?

35:16.115 --> 35:17.814
(laughs) yeah.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.817
(laughs)

35:20.819 --> 35:24.554
He loves that name.
(laughing)

35:24.556 --> 35:27.390
Uh, uh, what about...

35:27.392 --> 35:28.525
<i>Joseph.</i>

35:28.527 --> 35:33.663
No, I gotta go with, uh,
with nick's wishes.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.432
No, that's--that's--
that's his wish.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.600
Um, joseph...

35:36.602 --> 35:37.801
<i>After her father.</i>

35:37.803 --> 35:40.170
After your father.
My father?

35:44.642 --> 35:46.209
Joseph nick.

35:48.613 --> 35:50.280
That's a good name.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.516
Yeah. (chuckles) I'll call him
"jedi" for short.

35:52.518 --> 35:56.920
(laughs)

36:03.494 --> 36:05.162
(sniffles)

36:05.164 --> 36:06.496
(exhales)

36:12.170 --> 36:15.338
(indistinct conversations)

36:17.341 --> 36:20.243
Hey, I heard you found
that girl a liver.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.579
Yeah. Her family's up north.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.247
They're coming down.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.551
Do I get a reprimand?

36:27.553 --> 36:29.686
Uh, for what,

36:29.688 --> 36:30.854
Not filling out any forms

36:30.856 --> 36:33.390
Or asking any permission
whatsoever?

36:34.725 --> 36:37.861
The transplant team is taking
out his liver as we speak.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.396
I'm just gonna stick around.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.666
Cool.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.871
Okay. So I was gone, joel.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.473
Mm-hmm.
And I don't know if it's
that I'm slow or--

36:50.475 --> 36:53.777
Like you said--
or that I'm different,

36:53.779 --> 36:56.546
Or--or what,
but I feel different.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.981
I don't know if I'm
the same kind of doctor

36:57.983 --> 36:59.382
That I was before.

36:59.384 --> 37:00.951
Well, are you better,
or are you worse?

37:00.953 --> 37:02.552
I have no idea.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.621
But reycraft scooping
my surgery from me this morning,

37:04.623 --> 37:06.223
There is no way I would have
allowed that to happen

37:06.225 --> 37:07.557
A year ago.
You just found a liver

37:07.559 --> 37:09.793
For a girl who would have
died otherwise.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.295
Do me a favor.
Get in there.

37:13.764 --> 37:15.398
Oh,    <i>and...</i>

37:15.400 --> 37:17.634
You are talking
about your feelings...

37:17.636 --> 37:20.370
(indistinct conversations
continue)

37:20.372 --> 37:21.404
(huffs)

37:21.406 --> 37:24.608
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

37:39.824 --> 37:42.459
Knife.

37:46.297 --> 37:48.398
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

37:48.400 --> 37:49.866
(ryan speaking indistinctly)

37:49.868 --> 37:51.568
Hi there.

37:51.570 --> 37:55.272
Hey.
I have something for you.

37:55.274 --> 37:58.275
Um, he can take it
for show and tell.
(rattles)

37:58.277 --> 38:01.044
Wow. Thank you.
No problem.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.545
Look at that.
You're welcome.

38:02.547 --> 38:05.282
Hey, uh, ryan thought of
a joke for you.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.284
Okay. Yeah. That, um,

38:07.286 --> 38:08.585
That was sort of
more of a ploy

38:08.587 --> 38:10.820
To make him
sit through the operation.

38:10.822 --> 38:13.556
Listen, my 8-year-old son,
he thought of a joke for you.

38:13.558 --> 38:15.659
You're gonna sit down
and you're gonna listen to it

38:15.661 --> 38:17.427
And you're gonna
laugh your ass off,

38:17.429 --> 38:18.862
'cause it's
really freakin' funny.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.063
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

38:20.065 --> 38:22.565
Okay.
Okay.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.534
(exhales)

38:24.536 --> 38:26.503
Lay it on me.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.572
So a man walks
into the emergency room

38:29.574 --> 38:32.575
And yells, "doctor! Doctor!
I'm shrinking!"

38:32.577 --> 38:34.444
(knocks)

38:34.446 --> 38:36.579
(people speaking indistinctly)

38:36.581 --> 38:38.682
Hey.
Hey.

38:38.684 --> 38:42.819
Uh, shahir said I should
come and talk to you.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.622
Oh. Uh, have a seat.

38:45.624 --> 38:48.725
No, thank you.
I'll, uh, I'll stand.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.561
That's a... A nice fern.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.729
Thanks.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.469
Okay, there's this thing that
I need to talk about,

38:59.471 --> 39:04.040
But, um, I can't
talk about it, so, uh...

39:04.042 --> 39:06.509
"I watch death."

39:06.511 --> 39:07.844
You know what that means?

39:07.846 --> 39:09.045
Yeah. That's the mnemonic

39:09.047 --> 39:10.613
For the organic causes
of hallucinations.

39:10.615 --> 39:13.616
Right. Uh, what are
the psychological causes

39:13.618 --> 39:16.820
That, uh, someone
or a patient

39:16.822 --> 39:18.722
Might be hallucinating?

39:18.724 --> 39:22.492
Uh, pathological bereavement,
pathological depression,

39:22.494 --> 39:24.027
Postpartum psychosis.

39:24.029 --> 39:27.697
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

39:27.699 --> 39:29.632
Okay.

39:29.634 --> 39:31.568
We're good.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.605
Uh, dr. Harris,
if you do want to...
Oh. Sorry.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.774
Talk about...

39:37.776 --> 39:38.908
What was that?

39:38.910 --> 39:41.678
Uh... I have no idea.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.381
Hmm. There's a couch
in your office.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.783
Yes.
It's for healing the mind.

39:48.085 --> 39:50.153
I know.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.425
You know, if people knew
what we did on this couch...

39:55.427 --> 39:57.694
Mm. They'd get better
so fast.

39:59.430 --> 40:02.599
(indistinct conversations)

40:05.102 --> 40:07.070
Katie?

40:07.072 --> 40:08.938
Do you mind if I
keep you company?

40:08.940 --> 40:10.807
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

40:10.809 --> 40:12.675
You really want to?

40:12.677 --> 40:14.644
Yeah. I do.

40:19.084 --> 40:23.086
¶

40:23.088 --> 40:25.688
You're going through
a terrible time,

40:25.690 --> 40:28.458
But it's just
a moment in time...

40:28.460 --> 40:31.828

40:31.830 --> 40:36.032
¶ how do we get over
this time? ¶

40:36.034 --> 40:37.767
Patient walks into an e.R.,

40:37.769 --> 40:41.471
And he says,
"doctor, look at me.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.072
I... I'm shrinking."

40:43.074 --> 40:45.875
So the doc says to him,

40:45.877 --> 40:50.480
"well, then, you will just
have to be a little patient."

40:50.482 --> 40:54.451
¶ one foot in a sinking hole

No. I think we're lucky.

42:19.271 --> 42:23.172
So... Why does that
make me so nervous?

42:23.174 --> 42:25.208
¶ let it get too hard

42:25.210 --> 42:28.144
