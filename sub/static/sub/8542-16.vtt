WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:05.353
Body's inside.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.050
Victim's name is
Gabriel Meadows.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.052
Somebody hit him in the back
of the head with a blunt object.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.488
Cleaning crew found
him around 1:00 A.M.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.055
Any witnesses?

00:12.142 --> 00:14.231
Local boys talked to a
co-worker, Dave Bisping

00:14.318 --> 00:15.928
who saw him here at
10:00 last night.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.756
- Rigsby's meeting him at CBI.
- What about the murder weapon?

00:17.843 --> 00:19.106
Nothing inside.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.498
Maybe the killer
dropped it nearby.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.805
Get a group of people together.
Search the area.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.807
Trash duty.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.462
- Is there a problem?
- No. Nothing.

00:27.549 --> 00:30.030
Alright, when Cho
shows up, grab him.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.902
- Spread the pain around.
- Alright.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.426
[instrumental music]

00:36.819 --> 00:38.908
Morning, Lisbon.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.040
Is it morning yet?

00:40.127 --> 00:41.650
Not quite.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.130
Any prints?

00:43.217 --> 00:45.480
None. But it looks
like someone wiped up.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.308
Some of the blood is smears,
not spatter.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.439
Was anything missing?

00:48.526 --> 00:50.093
Looks like his
laptop was taken

00:50.180 --> 00:51.660
but whoever took it
was in a hurry.

00:51.747 --> 00:55.446
They left his cell
phone and wallet.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.969
Interesting, yes?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.667
Hmm, because the murder
and the theft

00:58.754 --> 01:00.103
seem hurried, impulsive.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.410
But the cleanup,
methodical and careful.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.239
Almost as if it was carried out
by two different people.

01:05.326 --> 01:09.156
You think somebody else
cleaned up after he was killed?

01:09.243 --> 01:11.027
Why would somebody do that?

01:11.114 --> 01:12.768
Excellent question.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.639
"Anti-Cult activistnetwork."

01:14.726 --> 01:16.989
I've heard of them,
they expose fake religions

01:17.077 --> 01:18.817
rescue cult members,
stuff like that?

01:18.904 --> 01:22.256
Meadows specialized
in one in particular.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.040
"Visualize."
Wait, that's the cult

01:24.127 --> 01:25.172
that Bret Stiles runs.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.130
- You got it.
- Great. Great.

01:27.217 --> 01:28.479
We're dealing with those wackos
again.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.090
"Wackos?"

01:30.177 --> 01:31.743
That's a little
uncharitable, Lisbon.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.180
Uncharitable?
What do you mean?

01:33.267 --> 01:34.355
Well, I always knew
that you were

01:34.442 --> 01:36.270
closed-minded
about Visualize

01:36.357 --> 01:37.619
but I never thought
you were actually bigoted.

01:37.706 --> 01:38.707
I'm not bigoted.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.448
Of course you
would think that.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.276
Because your
preconceptions blind you.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.625
'Use your eyes.'

01:43.712 --> 01:45.975
Your eyes are
the gateway to truth.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.846
I actually have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:47.933 --> 01:50.588
I know you don't,
but he does. Hi.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.068
Excuse me?

01:52.155 --> 01:53.983
You're a member
of Visualize.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.028
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.639
"Your eyes are
the gateway to truth.."

01:57.726 --> 01:58.901
Visualize dogma.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.468
You're the only one
that recognized it.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.992
Look, I don't know
what you're after.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.821
- I'm just trying to do my job.
- Well, let me explain.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.128
A critic of Visualize
was killed here this evening

02:08.215 --> 02:09.868
and a member shows
up at the scene.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.522
That can't be an accident.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.481
You're the one that
cleared all this up.

02:13.568 --> 02:16.571
- Well, that's crazy.
- I don't think it's crazy.

02:16.658 --> 02:19.008
- What's your name?
- Downs.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.489
Were you involved in this,
Officer Downs?

02:21.576 --> 02:22.968
No. No.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.796
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

02:24.883 --> 02:28.409
You're coming with us.
We're gonna search your car.

02:28.496 --> 02:32.195
- Stop him! Somebody stop him!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

02:32.282 --> 02:33.805
Let me go!

02:33.892 --> 02:36.547
- This is religious persecution!
- Let's go.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.291
Pre-member bigot!

02:41.378 --> 02:44.294
Sticks and stones
may break my bones

02:44.381 --> 02:47.341
but names will never hurt me.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.257
[theme music]

03:04.619 --> 03:07.361
We're testing your
uniform for blood

03:07.448 --> 03:09.798
and we found this in the trunk
of your squad car.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.761
Your watch commander
vouched for your whereabouts

03:16.848 --> 03:18.328
at the time of the murder.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.634
We know you didn't
kill Meadows

03:19.721 --> 03:21.201
but you did clean
up the crime scene

03:21.288 --> 03:24.856
making it very difficult
for us to find the killer.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.206
Why would you do that?

03:31.559 --> 03:32.560
Hello?

03:42.657 --> 03:45.703
So, Mr. Bisping, you set up
A-CAN with Meadows, right?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.966
How'd he get into
the anti-cult business?

03:48.053 --> 03:50.360
Uh, Gabe was born
into Visualize.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.841
When his parents
died five years ago

03:52.928 --> 03:55.191
he sort of woke up.
Um..

03:56.584 --> 03:59.326
His younger sister
is still in Visualize.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.502
Everything he did
was about getting her out.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.896
All it did
was get him killed.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.158
Visualize has
a lot of enemies.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.725
Why would they target Gabe?

04:07.812 --> 04:10.075
To shut him up.

04:10.162 --> 04:12.469
Gabe was
a fierce researcher.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.036
He broke a lot of
embarrassing stories

04:14.123 --> 04:17.518
about Visualize
for our web site.

04:17.605 --> 04:18.954
He was hitting
the inner circle hard.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.172
The inner circle?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.958
They help Stiles
run Visualize.

04:23.045 --> 04:25.830
It-it's sort of his
College of Cardinals.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.615
What was Gabe working
on before he died?

04:27.702 --> 04:29.791
Murder.

04:29.878 --> 04:33.751
From the early days
of Visualize back in the '70s.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.014
Gabe thought Stiles
killed a rival of his

04:36.101 --> 04:37.277
to consolidate his power.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.582
He dig up any evidence?

04:38.669 --> 04:41.281
He told me last
week he was close.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.500
Now he's dead.

04:43.587 --> 04:44.588
What do you think?

04:45.937 --> 04:47.330
[telephone ringing]

04:47.417 --> 04:49.201
How's the spy?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.986
He hasn't moved since
we brought him in.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.162
- It's creepy.
- Well, it's not surprising.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.817
He's a member of
a brainwashing cult.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.384
The thought of a clean mind

04:57.471 --> 04:59.255
is terribly
frightening to you.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.517
Isn't it, Patrick?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.780
Bret Stiles.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.305
The brainwasher-in-chief.

05:05.392 --> 05:08.482
Ah, Agent Lisbon,
it's been far too long.

05:08.569 --> 05:11.093
Why are you here,
Mr. Stiles?

05:11.180 --> 05:14.705
I'm the spiritual advisor
of a man that you've imprisoned

05:14.792 --> 05:16.881
and I was told
that Patrick here

05:16.968 --> 05:18.361
tricked him into revealing

05:18.448 --> 05:19.971
that he was a member
of my church

05:20.058 --> 05:22.322
which, of course,
is not a crime.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.715
He tampered with evidence.
That is a crime.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.283
Well, if you let me
talk to him, Agent Lisbon

05:27.370 --> 05:28.676
I'm sure we can clear
all this up.

05:28.763 --> 05:31.766
Uh, what's going on, Bret?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.855
- Hmm?
- They're not Visualize members.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.378
They're professional muscle.

05:35.465 --> 05:36.901
You don't trust your own
people to protect you.

05:36.988 --> 05:38.468
What are you scared of?

05:38.555 --> 05:39.991
I wouldn't want you
to mistake me

05:40.078 --> 05:41.819
for Red John
and shoot me.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.607
[intense music]

05:46.694 --> 05:48.565
Look at me.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.308
Tell them everything.

05:55.703 --> 05:58.923
I heard a report of
the body over my radio.

05:59.010 --> 06:02.449
Got to the office before
the first responders.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.233
Wiped the surfaces
for fingerprints

06:04.320 --> 06:05.539
wiped up some blood, too.

06:05.626 --> 06:08.498
- Why?
- Meadows was an ex-member.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.718
A non-person.

06:10.805 --> 06:15.026
Whoever killed him was
doing Visualize a service.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.333
You were duty-bound to
help clean up the evidence

06:17.420 --> 06:18.639
weren't you?

06:21.293 --> 06:25.123
No. I did it
of my own initiative.

06:25.210 --> 06:28.257
You know, as a rule,
we hope to welcome back

06:28.344 --> 06:29.998
'ex-members into the fold.'

06:30.085 --> 06:32.740
We certainly don't want
to aid their assassins.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.873
What about the missing laptop?
Did you take that?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.484
No.

06:37.571 --> 06:40.574
The computer was already
gone when I got there.

06:40.661 --> 06:43.228
Hmm.
That's the truth.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.883
[sighs]
Alright.
Take him to booking

06:49.713 --> 06:52.760
Well, I've done
my good deed for the day.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.631
If there's nothing else,
I'll be getting along.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.241
We just have
a few more questions.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.200
Well, uh, could we
do it on the walk?

06:58.287 --> 07:00.811
Uh, I've gotta get back
to running my religion.

07:00.898 --> 07:03.074
Yes, your flock
won't fleece itself.

07:03.161 --> 07:07.122
Mr. Stiles, where were you last
night between 10:00 and 1:00?

07:07.209 --> 07:09.646
What, uh, during the murder?
Let me see.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.474
I was at Casper's Bistro.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.042
Had the roasted turbot.
It was a little dry.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.871
We'll check, I'm also gonna
have Agent Rigsby get in contact

07:16.958 --> 07:18.307
with your people to see what
your schedule was yesterday.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.091
Of course.

07:20.178 --> 07:23.530
Uh, I have one last question.

07:23.617 --> 07:26.184
You did this
for a lowly drone.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.795
Why is that?

07:27.882 --> 07:31.015
Every man in Visualize
is like a son to me.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.323
Every woman
is my daughter.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.978
Ooh. How are those
demons of yours

07:37.065 --> 07:38.980
coming on, Patrick?

07:39.067 --> 07:40.938
They're still chasing you,
are they?

07:42.897 --> 07:44.159
I'm chasing them.

07:45.769 --> 07:46.944
Are you?

07:49.207 --> 07:52.254
Seriously, I haven't had
hot water in three days.

07:52.341 --> 07:56.911
My landlord's being a total
jerk and won't fix it.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.782
You should buy.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.784
So I can deal with a bank
instead of a landlord?

08:00.871 --> 08:02.177
Big step up.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.353
Excuse me, agents?
We found something.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.702
You should take a look.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.664
They were stuffed
inside this old TV.

08:10.751 --> 08:13.362
We almost missed 'em.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.668
Ooh, a lot of blood here.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.368
That suit
looks handmade.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.196
If the tailor's local,
maybe we can ID the owner.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.807
"Gerard's on Sutter."

08:23.894 --> 08:25.940
- That's in San Fran, isn't it?
- Yeah.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.772
What are you reading?
"Visualize Self."

08:31.859 --> 08:32.903
You thinking about converting?

08:32.990 --> 08:34.775
Yeah, just brushing up.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.125
Well, Stiles might have to
write his next book from jail.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.561
His alibi didn't hold up.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.084
He left the restaurant
at 10:30.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.999
- Well, that's not like him.
- To lie?

08:42.086 --> 08:45.568
- No, to do it so poorly.
- Van Pelt and Cho called in.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.832
Tailor identified the clothes.
They belong to Bret Stiles.

08:48.919 --> 08:52.096
Alright, we're dealing with the
head of a multi-national cult

08:52.183 --> 08:53.402
a 900-pound gorilla.

08:53.489 --> 08:56.710
We need to proceed
carefully and slowly.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.189
Put together a timeline
of the day of the murder.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.756
I wanna know where
he was every minute.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.542
- You got it.
- We should pay Bret a visit.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.239
Not until we have
an airtight case.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.371
Where's the fun in that?

09:06.458 --> 09:09.157
Let's get a stick and go
and poke this 900-pound gorilla.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.638
See what happens.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.901
[instrumental music]

09:19.254 --> 09:21.343
Mr. Stiles.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.171
Oh, Patrick. Agent Lisbon.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.868
How nice of you
to join us.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.567
This is Cal Leben
and Jason Cooper.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.004
Two of my most
loyal lieutenants.

09:30.091 --> 09:33.964
Your alibi for the Meadows
killing didn't hold up.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.487
You left that restaurant
hours earlier

09:35.575 --> 09:37.446
than you told me you did.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.623
Really? I must have been
mistaken. I'm sorry.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.408
And, uh, we found bloody
clothes in a dumpster

09:43.495 --> 09:44.758
'near the crime scene.'

09:44.845 --> 09:46.803
Bloody clothes
that belong to you.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.806
Listen, I give clothes
away all the time

09:49.893 --> 09:51.329
to Visualize charities.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.940
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.681
[phone ringing]

09:54.768 --> 09:56.030
Would you excuse me?

09:57.161 --> 09:58.510
Rigsby, what's up?

10:01.470 --> 10:02.645
What's going on, Bret?

10:03.690 --> 10:05.605
Beg your pardon?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.607
You know this doesn't look good,
yet you're not asking

10:07.694 --> 10:08.999
the questions that you should.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.654
Huh?

10:11.741 --> 10:13.787
Why is it that
you're not worried?

10:13.874 --> 10:16.920
What does Bret Stiles
have to be worried about?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.620
Well, he's about to get
arrested for murder.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.754
- Bret, what's he talking about?
- Let it go.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.237
- Do you recognize this?
- Well. Let me see. Ooh.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.283
Well, I suppose it could
be me giving a speech.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.198
Aha.
I give lots of speeches.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.723
It was taken yesterday,
and you're wearing

10:36.810 --> 10:39.029
the shirt and tie
we found covered in blood.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.860
Bret Stiles,
you're under arrest

10:43.947 --> 10:45.993
for the murder of
Gabriel Meadows.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.734
You have to come with us.
Let's go.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.699
I said let's go.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.879
[chairs creaking]

11:07.884 --> 11:10.757
[intense music]

11:27.817 --> 11:30.690
[music continues]

11:31.821 --> 11:33.605
Uh..

11:33.693 --> 11:37.044
Everyone, no cause for alarm.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.482
Be at peace.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.312
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

11:45.269 --> 11:48.055
[music continues]

11:59.501 --> 12:02.504
Yes.
That appears to be mine.

12:05.812 --> 12:06.943
Where did the blood
come from?

12:08.031 --> 12:09.729
I don't know.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.082
Meadows was writing an
article on Timothy Farragut.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.040
He thought you'd
murdered him.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.086
Poor old Tim.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.958
He died, oh,
30 years ago now.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.786
Car crash on PCH.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.962
And what if Meadows
found evidence

12:26.049 --> 12:28.269
that it wasn't an accident?

12:28.356 --> 12:30.575
That would give you motive
for murder, wouldn't it?

12:30.662 --> 12:33.491
No.
Because there's nothing to find.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.450
Look, I'm not responsible
for Tim's death

12:35.537 --> 12:37.669
or the demise
of Mr. Meadows.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.759
Then why does the
evidence say you are?

12:41.456 --> 12:43.284
Well, maybe
I'm being set up.

12:43.371 --> 12:45.939
And why would
somebody do that?

12:46.026 --> 12:48.245
Tell me, Agent Lisbon.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.900
Do you enjoy watching
Patrick Jane

12:50.987 --> 12:53.381
take over your team
and your life?

12:53.468 --> 12:55.252
We close cases.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.385
That's all that
matters to me.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.691
Oh, I see.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.565
So you're telling me that you
love justice more than yourself?

13:03.652 --> 13:05.785
Come on.
Justice, what-what is that?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.482
It's just an idea.

13:07.569 --> 13:11.791
You are flesh and blood.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.968
Why sacrifice the real
for the imaginary?

13:15.055 --> 13:17.666
I'm not looking
for a guru.

13:17.753 --> 13:21.104
- I'm looking for a murderer.
- Hmm.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.106
Well..

13:23.193 --> 13:24.586
...I didn't kill anybody.

13:24.673 --> 13:28.155
And if you keep
insisting that I did then..

13:28.242 --> 13:31.506
...gonna have to lawyer up.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.421
[telephone ringing]

13:33.508 --> 13:34.901
He's lawyered up.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.380
It doesn't give us
much time to nail him.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.295
Where are we at with
the bloody clothes?

13:38.382 --> 13:40.689
Lab confirmed the blood type is
A-Negative, same as the victim

13:40.776 --> 13:42.822
but they won't have the DNA
results for three or four days.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.954
We don't have that much time.
We need something else.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.304
We're still missing the murder
weapon and the victim's laptop.

13:47.391 --> 13:48.871
We're gonna need to search
his house and office.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.264
- I'll get a warrant.
- Good.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.918
Where are we at with
the Farragut motive?

13:52.005 --> 13:53.180
Well, apparently,
his notes were on the laptop

13:53.267 --> 13:54.529
so that's no good.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.747
I have a file of his stories.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.184
Meadows definitely
had a solid contact

13:57.271 --> 13:59.055
feeding him inside
information about Visualize.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.796
Any idea on how
to find the source?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.754
Yeah, there's an old hippie
named Randall Parker.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.799
He's an ex-Visualize member.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.322
Meadows talked to him last week.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.672
Start with him.
What about Meadows' sister?

14:07.759 --> 14:09.761
She's at Clear View ,
the Visualize College.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.546
Visualize has a college?

14:11.633 --> 14:13.026
Apparently, you major
in yourself.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.335
Ah, Patrick.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.511
I wondered when
you'd pop in.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.078
Hmm.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.037
Reading about you.

14:24.124 --> 14:27.083
Gabe Meadows doesn't paint
a very pretty picture.

14:27.170 --> 14:31.044
Oh, surely you're not going
to fall forgutter journalism.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.394
One thing that's consistent
in all these stories

14:33.481 --> 14:36.136
is that you never actually
wield the knife yourself.

14:36.223 --> 14:40.183
You always manipulate someone
else into doing your dirty work.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.577
That's somethingyou'd
know a little bit about.

14:42.664 --> 14:45.710
Getting Red John to kill
the San Joaquin killer

14:45.797 --> 14:46.929
that was very nice.

14:47.016 --> 14:50.193
Almost elegant, I'd say.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.065
Yes, you're coming along.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.241
I'm doing nothing
of this sort.

14:56.504 --> 15:00.377
You're not very happy,
are you, Patrick?

15:00.464 --> 15:04.251
Perhaps you feel a bit like
the sorcerer's apprentice

15:04.338 --> 15:08.777
you've woken up a power
that you can't control.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.345
Tell me, how is
Rosalind Harker

15:11.432 --> 15:13.869
enjoying life under
FBI protection?

15:13.956 --> 15:17.307
Is she glad that you brought
Red John back into her life?

15:19.788 --> 15:22.008
Are you enjoying this?

15:22.095 --> 15:24.880
'Cause I know you didn't
kill Gabe Meadows.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.969
I've been telling
you that all along.

15:27.056 --> 15:30.930
But you're not acting like
a man that's being framed.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.323
Even someone in your position
is gonna reach out for help

15:33.410 --> 15:36.544
when being framed.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.894
Jon Musashi.
I'm Mr. Stiles' attorney.

15:38.981 --> 15:39.982
This interview is over.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.553
Hi, Jon.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.469
Are you a member of Visualize?
Yes, I think you are.

15:48.556 --> 15:51.951
Did you know that Mr. Stiles'
last lawyer was a murderer?

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996
Whereas I am not.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.955
And again,
this interview is over.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.826
Excellent.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.959
Well, if you'll excuse me
always a pleasure.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.090
Nice to meet you, Jon

16:02.048 --> 16:04.137
Jon..

16:04.224 --> 16:05.486
Thank you for coming.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.140
- Thank you--
- Mr. Stiles, please.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.184
[Stiles]
'I need to tell
them everything.'

16:08.271 --> 16:10.186
'But I mean, you know me.'

16:12.667 --> 16:15.409
I mean, I'm the leader
of a church, I mean..

16:19.065 --> 16:21.981
[church bell ringing]

16:27.595 --> 16:29.379
Really, I'm okay.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.512
I'm glad to hear it.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.470
No, I mean you can
go back to class.

16:33.557 --> 16:37.039
Oh, my inner visions
don't start for another hour.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.694
Agent Lisbon.
Dean Nora Hill.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.739
Ah, thank you for taking
the time to meet me.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.611
Happy to assist.
That will be all, Rose.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.308
Thank you, Dean Hill.

16:45.395 --> 16:48.268
Jessie Meadows is waiting
for you in Stiles Hall.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.704
It's an impressive campus.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.010
Thank you.

16:51.097 --> 16:55.710
4,642 students
from 27 countries.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.408
Only the best and
the brightest young people.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.497
How are the students
taking the news?

17:00.584 --> 17:01.977
What news?

17:02.064 --> 17:04.153
That one of the students'
brother's been murdered

17:04.240 --> 17:06.764
and your leader's been
arrested for the crime?

17:06.851 --> 17:09.463
They don't know about that.
They don't need to.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.204
But it's all over
the internet.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.815
They don't have
the internet.

17:13.902 --> 17:17.688
The mind suffers from junk
food as much as the body does.

17:17.775 --> 17:18.776
We keep it away.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.519
Does Jessie know
her brother's dead?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.043
Aren't you gonna
tell her?

17:26.436 --> 17:29.700
[Lisbon]
'We'll do whatever we can
to find out who did this.'

17:29.787 --> 17:31.876
I am so sorry
for your loss.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.054
Oh, Gabe.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.191
I'm sorry he's dead

17:42.278 --> 17:44.454
but he wasn't a part
of my life anymore.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.239
He's still your brother.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.154
He left me.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.678
Left us.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.071
That's not what
a brother does.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.642
Can you think of anybody
who may have wanted to hurt him?

18:01.689 --> 18:04.300
Gabe published stories
about our community.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.042
Some of the students here,
they didn't like it.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.349
Some of them even thought that
I was feeding him information.

18:09.436 --> 18:12.917
- Were you?
- No, I wouldn't do that.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.616
I know you and your
brother didn't get along.

18:15.703 --> 18:18.184
And he wanted to help you.

18:18.271 --> 18:22.753
I think he wanted that
more than anything.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.322
That was the problem.
I didn't need his help.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.584
He couldn't see that.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.025
I'm with my real family here.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.858
[engine revving]

18:46.821 --> 18:48.214
[Rigsby]
'Thanks for seeing me,
Mr. Parker.'

18:48.301 --> 18:50.825
Meadows broke a lot of
stories about Visualize.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.261
Were you his source?

18:52.348 --> 18:55.960
All my stories are
30 years old.

18:56.047 --> 18:59.355
All I know about
are the old days.

18:59.442 --> 19:00.965
Did he ask you about
Timothy Farragut?

19:01.052 --> 19:03.316
- Sure.
- What'd you tell him?

19:03.403 --> 19:04.795
Well, Farragut
was into dispelling

19:04.882 --> 19:08.756
all the bad vibes
in the world.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.975
I liked how that sounded.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.629
A lot of people did.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.589
People who felt guilty
about having too much money.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.199
When did Bret Stiles
come into the picture?

19:17.286 --> 19:18.896
'76 or so.

19:18.983 --> 19:22.073
A year later, Farragut died,
and Stiles wastheman.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.336
I read the police report.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.598
Farragut's death seems like

19:24.685 --> 19:26.077
an open-and-shut
drunk driving fatality.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.993
Well, you notice
who wrote that report.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.561
Sheriff Elliott Elswit.

19:31.648 --> 19:34.347
Oh, he liked those
Visualize ladies

19:34.434 --> 19:36.653
and Stiles made sure
he met plenty.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.003
So you're saying that
the sheriff doctored the report?

19:39.090 --> 19:41.180
Well, Farragut didn't drink.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.183
How'd he get so loaded
he couldn't see a tree?

19:44.270 --> 19:45.749
How do I get in touch
with the sheriff?

19:45.836 --> 19:47.925
Elswit's been
dead 20 years.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.536
A suicide, they say.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.538
And you think that Bret Stiles
killed him, too?

19:51.625 --> 19:52.930
You bet I do.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.543
- You think I'm crazy?
- No.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.806
It's just a lot
of conspiracy talk.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.721
Well, just because
you're paranoid

20:00.808 --> 20:02.157
don't mean they're
not after you.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.681
Hey.
Where are you?

20:04.768 --> 20:08.250
- I'm back at the snake pit.
- Visualize? Why?

20:08.337 --> 20:10.383
[Jane]
'Okay, so the Visualize
attorney shows up'

20:10.470 --> 20:13.124
and Stiles starts acting
all weird and scared.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.561
It's just like a little show.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.085
- Hey, could you hold on?
- Yeah.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.783
Uh, would you mind giving
me some privacy, please?

20:24.397 --> 20:25.920
Really? Go.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.881
So Stiles is acting scared.
So?

20:30.968 --> 20:33.144
Well, it's for
the benefit of the lawyer.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.190
Whatever game he's playing,
it isn't aimed at us.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.888
It's aimed at Visualize,
and I'm here to find out why.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.673
- I'll call you when I get out.
- 'Okay.'

20:39.760 --> 20:41.152
Bye.

20:42.153 --> 20:45.069
[instrumental music]

20:45.156 --> 20:46.636
Leben.

20:48.508 --> 20:49.683
Mr. Jane.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.467
Hope the whole
"Arrest your master" thing

20:51.554 --> 20:52.816
didn't ruin your lunch.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.515
No hard feelings, right?

20:55.602 --> 20:57.299
Did you come here to gloat?

20:57.386 --> 21:00.737
No, I can gloat from a distance.
I have a message from Stiles.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.913
- Hmm. What is it?
- Sorry.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.480
It's for the entire
inner circle.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.786
Ah, you can give it to me.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.005
I'll pass it to
the other members.

21:08.092 --> 21:11.182
Yeah, I-I don't think so.
I think I need the whole gang.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.490
Light the Bret signal.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.971
Gather the pooh-bahs.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.320
Come on.
Let's go.

21:28.896 --> 21:31.202
Ah..

21:31.290 --> 21:35.816
Agent Grace Van Pelt,
I presume.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.775
Mr. Stiles, I'm hoping you can
help me with something.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.300
I'm trying to find
any property

21:41.387 --> 21:43.040
held by you in the
state of California.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.999
A car, a residence?

21:45.086 --> 21:48.916
- Please, Agent Grace Van Pelt.
- Excuse me?

21:49.003 --> 21:50.961
The helpless maiden routine?

21:52.789 --> 21:55.879
Worth a try. Look, I can't
find anything you own.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.317
Well, that's because
there's nothing to find.

21:58.404 --> 22:01.363
I have no house, no car.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.757
certainly not
in myname. Hmm?

22:03.844 --> 22:06.237
I've dedicated my
life to Visualize.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.022
So there's no place
for us to look?

22:08.109 --> 22:10.764
Oh, no. You can look and look.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.027
You will not find.

22:24.995 --> 22:27.215
You're upset.

22:28.869 --> 22:31.480
Something small, domestic?

22:31.567 --> 22:34.004
A household problem?

22:34.091 --> 22:35.658
No.

22:35.745 --> 22:39.183
Hmm? But no, it's not family.

22:39.270 --> 22:44.363
But still, it's...
connected to the home.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.016
Landlord.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.586
Petty dictator, no doubt.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.632
Abuses you because he can.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.896
Or because he's
a jerk. He won't fix..

23:00.683 --> 23:01.945
You're good.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.730
Not as good as Jane,
but good.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.210
Hmm.

23:06.297 --> 23:09.779
The anger that you
feel is a symptom

23:09.866 --> 23:11.694
of a deeper condition

23:11.781 --> 23:14.523
an organic rage, if you will.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.220
'You know..'

23:18.527 --> 23:21.225
I can help you with that.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.575
Not interested.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.751
Hmm?

23:24.838 --> 23:26.666
Close your eyes.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.321
Come on. Close your eyes.

23:30.409 --> 23:35.152
Visualize your anger as
a red cloud inside your body.

23:35.239 --> 23:37.024
Take some deep breaths.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.808
Exhale.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.594
Let the red smoke
come out of your body.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.815
Try it.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.817
Red smoke?

23:47.904 --> 23:49.689
Seriously?

23:49.776 --> 23:51.255
Or not.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.214
Your choice.

[door screeching]

24:23.679 --> 24:26.726
Mr. Jane, you have
a message for us from Bret?

24:26.813 --> 24:30.077
Uh, no, not really, no.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.209
Do you mind if I sit here?
Just can't resist.

24:32.296 --> 24:33.602
Looks too comfortable.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.127
Wow.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.440
I don't understand.

24:45.527 --> 24:48.225
We were told you had a message.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.705
No, that was a lie.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.142
I just wanted to get
you all together. Sorry.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.277
Why did you need
to get in here?

24:56.364 --> 24:58.279
Get the lay of the land see
who's running the show

24:58.366 --> 25:00.237
now that Bret's in the clink.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.631
None of us would presume to.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.894
Bret Stiles is
still our leader.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.722
Other members of the inner
circle are flying in.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.638
We hold a vote
reaffirming Bret tomorrow.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.251
Is that what you
came here to find out?

25:16.166 --> 25:19.169
I came here to accuse one
of you of framing Bret Stiles

25:19.256 --> 25:22.042
for the murder
of Gabriel Meadows.

25:22.999 --> 25:25.175
[instrumental music]

25:31.704 --> 25:33.662
And judging from your
reactions, none of you did that.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.272
Of course we didn't.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.928
Well, that clarifies
things considerably.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.800
How?

25:42.453 --> 25:45.544
Well, either one
of you framed Bret Stiles..

25:45.631 --> 25:47.894
Or?

25:47.981 --> 25:49.983
Or you didn't.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.247
What does that mean?

25:53.334 --> 25:55.423
Sorry. Can't tell you that.
That is a police secret.

25:55.510 --> 25:59.775
But you're gonna love it
when you do find out.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.821
Carry on.

Do you have hot water
at your place?

26:17.706 --> 26:20.274
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

26:20.361 --> 26:21.928
Fine. Whatever.

'Farragut had a commune
called Visualize'

26:52.741 --> 26:54.221
'Just a few hundred members'

and a promising young
guru named Bret Stiles.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.183
Farragut crashes his car.
Stiles takes over.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.316
Now, the police report says
it was an accident.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.666
Randal Parker says no,
Stiles killed Farragut

27:04.753 --> 27:06.450
and the cop that made
the accident report

27:06.537 --> 27:08.670
and Meadows, who was
investigating the whole thing.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.759
That's crazy.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.543
I don't know. I wouldn't
put anything past Stiles.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.415
Well, one thing's
for certain. We can't prove it.

27:14.502 --> 27:17.723
But Meadows may have a source
inside Visualize who can.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.855
- Any idea who that source is?
- No.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.771
It's definitely not
the sister. Who else is there?

27:22.858 --> 27:25.513
Maybe Stiles knows.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.471
I could ask. He talked
to me earlier.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.864
Maybe I could get
him to open up.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.693
What'd he say?

27:31.780 --> 27:34.043
He showed me something.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.611
Never mind. It's nothing.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.395
He's trying to get to you.

27:38.482 --> 27:39.701
What?

27:39.788 --> 27:41.268
No.

27:41.355 --> 27:44.575
Okay. Take another run
at him, but be careful.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.099
Alright.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.241
Hello, Grace.
You look refreshed.

27:58.328 --> 27:59.982
You tried my little trick then.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.331
No.

28:01.418 --> 28:04.247
Works though, doesn't it?

28:04.334 --> 28:06.380
I wanted to ask you
about Timothy Farragut.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.164
He ran Visualize
before you did, right?

28:08.251 --> 28:11.907
No one ran Visualize
before I did.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.343
No one.

28:13.430 --> 28:14.997
Hmm.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.347
Tim said things that
people wanted to hear

28:17.434 --> 28:20.481
but he didn't know what to do
with the people who listened.

28:20.568 --> 28:21.787
What do you mean?

28:21.874 --> 28:24.441
[sighs]
Farragut was a dreamer.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.443
And dreamers are
useful in their way

28:26.530 --> 28:29.142
but we don't live
in dreams, do we?

28:29.229 --> 28:32.406
We live in the here
and the now.

28:32.493 --> 28:33.886
Did you kill him?

28:35.975 --> 28:38.325
You've killed, haven't you?

28:38.412 --> 28:41.937
Someone who mattered
to you, who hurt you.

28:42.024 --> 28:44.766
Did you enjoy it?

28:44.853 --> 28:48.465
- No.
- Really?

28:48.552 --> 28:51.033
I'm told it gives the feeling
of great perspective

like waking from a dream.

28:55.603 --> 28:58.519
It...it changes you.

Did your friends notice?

29:03.480 --> 29:05.134
A little.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.919
But I think
it freaks 'em out.

Of course. They don't
have the imagination

with you about it. Hmm.

Enlightening. I need a
little more information.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.170
Could Bret Stiles know what
blood type Meadows was?

29:41.257 --> 29:43.477
Sure. Visualize keeps medical
records on all its members.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.871
And the source for Meadows'
stories was highly placed?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.176

you were that stupid

were doing it on purpose.

33:36.884 --> 33:39.800
[people applauding]

33:44.109 --> 33:46.633
Uh, I'm sorry. Are we
interrupting something?

33:49.027 --> 33:51.116
Bret, you're free.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.769
We dropped the charges.

33:52.856 --> 33:55.163
Looks like you guys
have been busy.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.644
Hello, Cooper.

33:57.731 --> 34:01.735
I see you've taken the seat
at the head of the table.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.478
That's very bold of you.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.133
We thought..

34:08.220 --> 34:09.612
What? You thought, what?

34:09.699 --> 34:12.137
My corpse cold enough to loot?

34:12.224 --> 34:13.529
Bret.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.270
Mr. Stiles..

34:15.357 --> 34:19.100
Do you really think that I am
weak enough to be pushed aside?

34:19.187 --> 34:21.363
I mean, do-do you think
that I'm stupid enough

34:21.450 --> 34:24.323
to get caught
with blood on my hands?

34:29.328 --> 34:31.634
Tell me, Cooper.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.246
Do I seem weak to you now?

34:36.596 --> 34:38.511
Hmm?

34:38.598 --> 34:40.034
Sit down.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.910
[people applauding]

34:46.997 --> 34:48.999
Thank you.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.479
Nice to be back.

34:50.566 --> 34:53.047
Just one more piece
of business to, uh, clear up.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.005
In the matter
of personal curiosity

34:55.093 --> 34:57.399
who of you voted
for Cooper here?

34:58.008 --> 34:59.009
Hmm?

35:00.707 --> 35:03.057
Well, I don't see
how that's important.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.537
Well, that's one vote,

35:04.624 --> 35:07.453
Obviously. Who else
voted for Cooper?

35:09.411 --> 35:11.935
You did.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.851
And you.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.636
'Yes, and you.'

35:16.723 --> 35:19.769
Oh, Bret, looks like
it was a landslide.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.467
Well, Leben.

35:21.554 --> 35:24.165
You've always been
true to me, I know.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.865
Hmm.

35:29.997 --> 35:31.346
I see.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.394
I stood by you, Bret.

35:35.481 --> 35:38.136
I told them they were
fools to doubt you.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.442
Really?

35:40.529 --> 35:42.662
Stiles is going down for murder.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.316
Shouldn't you have sucked
up to the new boss

35:44.403 --> 35:46.318
'like the rest of these folks?'

35:46.405 --> 35:48.450
The bloody clothes,
the security footage

35:48.537 --> 35:50.931
'Stiles seemed very guilty.'

35:51.018 --> 35:53.977
You had to be 100%
sure he wasn't.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.849
How would you know that?

35:58.460 --> 36:02.551
You're the killer.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.423
That's ridiculous.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.295
- Hmm.
- Is it?

36:07.382 --> 36:08.905
[Lisbon]
'You couldn't warn the others'

36:08.992 --> 36:11.256
'because then they would
know you were a murderer.'

36:11.343 --> 36:14.563
You voted for Stiles because
you knew he'd be coming back.

36:16.739 --> 36:18.741
[intense music]

36:24.269 --> 36:26.706
Damn you for what
you've turned me into.

36:31.232 --> 36:34.235
So you were Meadows'
inside source?

36:34.322 --> 36:36.846
I fed him information
when it helped me.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.371
You leaked stories that hurt
your enemies at Visualize.

36:43.462 --> 36:47.379
My mistake was..

36:47.466 --> 36:49.729
...was letting him
know who I was.

36:51.948 --> 36:54.081
Meadows was desperate

36:54.168 --> 36:56.388
to connect Stiles
to the murder of Farragut

36:56.475 --> 36:59.782
and he thought I knew
something that could prove it.

36:59.869 --> 37:02.698
Why not give it to him?

37:02.785 --> 37:04.918
Doesn't exist.

37:06.485 --> 37:10.793
Do you think Bret Stiles
needs a smoking gun?

37:10.880 --> 37:15.581
He probably didkill
Farragut and that sheriff

37:15.668 --> 37:18.148
but there'll never be
any evidence to prove it.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.934
I don't believe you.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.544
That's the truth.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.726
What do you think Stiles
would do if he found out

37:30.813 --> 37:32.554
you'd been feeding
me information?

37:35.035 --> 37:37.429
[Nora Hill]
I sensed that Meadows' crusade

37:37.516 --> 37:40.736
was pushing him
to desperate measures.

37:40.823 --> 37:44.523
So...I brought the
hammer, just in case.

37:58.145 --> 38:01.322
I knew my name was all over
the laptop, so I took it.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.851
I examined myself honestly

38:08.938 --> 38:12.246
and I find I feel no remorse.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.382
150,000 people die
every single day.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.340
And why should I feel anything

38:19.427 --> 38:21.516
for one man, just 'cause..

38:26.521 --> 38:28.958
...just 'cause I was
the cause of his death?

38:30.569 --> 38:32.484
That's a good question.

38:32.571 --> 38:33.963
Sign here.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.626
So that's it then.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.107
Thank you for letting
me watch this.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.152
No problem.

38:49.239 --> 38:52.373
Visualizing my anger
works really well.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.332
Just returning the favor.

38:57.378 --> 39:00.338
There's so much more
that I could teach you.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.035
Is there?

39:02.122 --> 39:05.734
To be free of doubt,
anger, fear.

39:08.650 --> 39:11.653
Let me show you the world
as you've never seen it.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.046
Let me show you

39:13.133 --> 39:16.354
you as you've never
seen yourself.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.794
Great sales pitch.

39:24.405 --> 39:27.277
But I'm sort of over
bad boys these days.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.553
Thanks anyway.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.476
Ms. Hill killed Gabe? Why?

39:51.563 --> 39:54.696
There was political
stuff going on.

39:54.783 --> 39:58.918
But I think mostly your brother
just wanted you to be happy

39:59.005 --> 40:00.310
and to get out.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.661
I don't know what to do.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.576
We were going through
your brother's laptop

40:04.663 --> 40:07.535
and we found some videos
that he'd made for you.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.408
Kinda like letters.

40:12.061 --> 40:14.412
I thought you might
like to see one.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.980
'Happy Birthday, sis.'

40:18.067 --> 40:20.026
I hope it's a good one.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.941
I don't know if you'll
ever see this

40:22.028 --> 40:25.901
but I just wanted to say
that I'm proud of you.

40:25.988 --> 40:29.252
'I miss you so much, sis.'

40:29.339 --> 40:31.167
'I know we don't agree
about some things'

40:31.254 --> 40:35.607
but, uh, I hope you know
that I'm always here for you.'

40:35.694 --> 40:36.825
Anytime.

40:38.392 --> 40:40.525
I'll be waiting.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.091
'See you soon, I hope.'

40:45.660 --> 40:47.053
Are there more of these?

40:47.140 --> 40:51.187
Yeah, there's a whole
lot of 'em.

40:51.274 --> 40:54.452
Would it be okay if I
stayed to watch a few?

40:54.539 --> 40:56.454
You can stay as
long as you'd like.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.942
Ah, Patrick.

41:07.029 --> 41:10.119
Always a pleasure
doing business with you.

41:10.206 --> 41:14.080
There are many fearful men
hiding from my wrath tonight.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.995
It's a good feeling

41:16.082 --> 41:18.476
And the murder of Farragut goes
back in the cold case file

41:18.563 --> 41:19.999
so that's a nice twofer.

41:20.086 --> 41:23.437
Well, you didn't do
toobadly yourself.

41:23.524 --> 41:26.527
You played a deep
game here, Patrick.

41:26.614 --> 41:29.748
A mind like yours could've
developed a dozen ways

41:29.835 --> 41:31.314
of tricking Nora Hill

41:31.401 --> 41:33.882
without helping me
in mylittle power play.

41:33.969 --> 41:36.581
Well, I'm flattered.
It was the easiest way.

41:36.668 --> 41:38.887
No.

41:39.932 --> 41:41.107
No.

41:42.674 --> 41:46.112
You wanted me to owe you
a favor, didn't you?

41:47.940 --> 41:50.246
Hmm? Well, alright.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.683
I owe you.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.293
Yes.

41:56.992 --> 41:59.125
You do.

42:02.128 --> 42:03.259
Goodnight.

42:03.346 --> 42:04.957
Goodnight.
