WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:03.836
<i> PREVIOUSLY</i>
<i> ON</i> PRETTY LITTLE LIARS.

00:03.838 --> 00:06.171
Emily: I NEVER TOLD
THE POLICE WHERE YOU WERE.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.774
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?
THAT'S WHAT I ASKED YOU...

00:08.776 --> 00:10.376
BEFORE THE COPS
PICKED ME UP.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.144
I NEVER GOT
AN ANSWER, EITHER.

00:12.146 --> 00:15.180
THE D.A. IS DROPPING
THE CHARGES AGAINST ME.
I'M FREE.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.850
WE CAN GET THAT AWFUL THING
OFF YOUR LEG RIGHT NOW.
THE CAB IS WAITING.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.551
I'M GOING WITH SPENCER.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.819
Aria: WELL, HOW DID
YOU LIKE MR. FITZ?

00:20.821 --> 00:22.521
EVERY ENGLISH
DEPARTMENT HAS ONE,

00:22.523 --> 00:24.390
FULL OF CHARM
AND PROMISE.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.825
THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU CAN'T KEEP STAYING HERE.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.394
HEY, IF YOU NEED
A PLACE TO STAY,

00:28.396 --> 00:29.661
THERE'S AN OLD COUCH
IN MY BASEMENT.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.964
MY MOM
WILL NEVER KNOW.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.201
I FIGURED OUT
WHAT THE MESSAGE MEANS.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.171
IT WASN'T B-A-D.
IT WAS THE NUMBER 214.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.873
ALL EM, ALL THE TIME!

00:42.676 --> 00:44.543
DON'T TELL.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.379
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO,
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.581
<i> COME CLOSER.</i>
I THINK HE'S DANGEROUS.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.883
Melissa: AND I THINK
YOU NEED HELP.

00:50.885 --> 00:54.720
MELISSA...
SPENCER, WE'RE PREGNANT.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.221
( phone ringing )

00:56.223 --> 00:57.556
( beep )

00:57.558 --> 00:59.425
<i> MR. FITZ, THIS IS</i>
<i> BYRON MONTGOMERY.</i>

00:59.427 --> 01:01.360
<i> I'M SORRY ABOUT</i>
<i> HOW OUR MEETING WENT,</i>

01:01.362 --> 01:05.297
<i> AND I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU,</i>
<i> SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A BEER?</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:08.233
Fitz: IF YOU'RE TRYING OUT
FOR<i> THE BAD SEED,</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:10.836
YOU NEED TO SIGN UP HERE
AND WAIT BY THE AUDITORIUM DOOR

01:10.838 --> 01:12.471
UNTIL YOUR NAME
IS CALLED.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.373
THANK YOU,
AND GOOD LUCK.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.547
START WITH THE LINE
ABOUT THE STOLEN MEDAL.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.549
WHY ISN'T SHE
WEARING ANY SHOES?

01:23.551 --> 01:26.218
SO SHE CAN LOOK SHORT ENOUGH
TO PLAY AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.619
WHAT'S MY LINE?

01:27.621 --> 01:30.789
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
ABOUT A MEDAL.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.325
NO, THAT'S WHAT
THE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KILLED
HER CLASSMATE FOR.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.394
PENMANSHIP MEDAL.
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL
HER THE BAD SEED.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.362
A PENMANSHIP
MEDAL, REALLY?

01:37.364 --> 01:39.665
DIDN'T YOU READ
THE WHOLE PLAY?

01:39.667 --> 01:42.601
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
HANNA'S THE ONE TRYING OUT.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.570
I'M JUST HERE
TO MAKE HER LOOK TALLER.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.438
WHY DO I HAVE TO READ
THE WHOLE PLAY?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.273
I DON'T WANNA BE
THE BAD SEED'S MOTHER.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.542
I WANT THE OTHER MOTHER,
THE ONE WHO'S DRUNK
ALL THE TIME.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.279
NO COMMENT.
ARE YOU STILL RAGGING ON ME
FOR BRINGING A FLASK TO A DANCE?

01:54.281 --> 01:57.716
I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER PARENT, SPENCE.
ONE'S PLENTY.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.452
WELL, HAS THE ONE FIGURED OUT
THAT CALEB'S IN YOUR BASEMENT?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.888
NO, BUT "A" HAS.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.758
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.261
I'M GONNA TELL MY MOM
BEFORE "A" GETS TO HER.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.598
I'M JUST GONNA ASK HER
IF CALEB CAN STAY
IN THE GUESTROOM.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.633
HEY, THERE, HANNA
AND HER CLANNA!

02:14.635 --> 02:16.602
HEY, MONA.
HOW'D IT GO IN THERE?

02:16.604 --> 02:19.404
HONESTLY, I NAILED IT.
IT WAS EPIC.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.406
I THINK MR. FITZ CRIED.

02:21.408 --> 02:25.177
GOOD FOR YOU, MONA.
I GUESS THE REST OF US
SHOULD GO HOME.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.746
NO! THERE ARE
NO SMALL PARTS,

02:27.748 --> 02:30.115
ONLY PARTS THAT
DON'T MAKE IT
INTO THE YEARBOOK.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.750
GOOD LUCK.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.791
Spencer: WHY DON'T
YOU AUDITION?

02:39.793 --> 02:43.295
YOU KIND OF HAVE AN IN
WITH THE DIRECTOR.
STOP.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.465
IS HE WEARING
THE TIE YOU GAVE HIM?
STOP!

02:46.467 --> 02:48.634
IT WOULD BE SO AWESOME
TO HANG OUT WITH

02:48.636 --> 02:50.736
YOU TWO AFTER SCHOOL,
SEE YOU AS A COUPLE.

02:50.738 --> 02:54.206
NEWS FLASH. JUST 'CAUSE
WE'RE ON THIS SIDE
OF THE BUILDING

02:54.208 --> 02:56.808
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN
SUDDENLY LIGHT CANDLES
AND SLOW DANCE.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.544
THAT'S
THE OPENING NIGHT PARTY.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.680
"HELLO, ARIA."
"HELLO, EZRA."

03:01.682 --> 03:02.748
ARE YOU FINISHED?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.082
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'LL EVER BE ABLE

03:04.084 --> 03:05.784
TO GO ON A DOUBLE DATE
WITH YOU GUYS.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.319
YOU WON'T EVEN
SEND US PICTURES.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.288
PICTURES? HANNA, WE MEET
AT HIS APARTMENT.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.790
IT'S NOT SEA WORLD.
WE'RE JUST SAYING
IT'D BE NICE.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.127
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.429
WISH I COULD.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.032
BUT I CAN'T.
UM, WHERE'S YOUR OTHER SCENE?

03:24.338 --> 03:27.139
IS MR. FITZ
IN THE AUDITORIUM?

03:27.141 --> 03:30.242
UH, I'M, UH, RIGHT HERE, JENNA.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

03:30.244 --> 03:31.810
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

03:31.812 --> 03:33.645
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO COMPOSE SOME MUSIC
FOR THE PLAY.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.748
SURE. THAT'D BE GREAT.
FOR THE FLUTE?
YES.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.818
IS THERE A REASON THAT
YOU PICKED<i> THE BAD SEED?</i>

03:39.820 --> 03:42.354
IT'S ONE
OF MY FAVORITES.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.823
THE THEME
IS SO INSPIRING.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.259
UH, INSPIRING?

03:47.261 --> 03:50.128
I'M FASCINATED
BY THE NATURE OF EVIL.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.338
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT ¶</i>

03:59.340 --> 04:01.707
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

04:01.709 --> 04:04.343
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

04:04.345 --> 04:07.079
<i> ¶ TAKIN' THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

04:07.081 --> 04:09.214
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THAT I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

04:09.216 --> 04:12.117
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

04:12.119 --> 04:14.419
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO CAN</i>
<i> KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:16.588
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

04:23.797 --> 04:26.565
( baby cooing )

04:45.619 --> 04:47.419
MAMA.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.091
( gasps )

05:11.211 --> 05:12.978
( tape squeaking )

05:21.322 --> 05:23.655
OH, HEY. DIDN'T,
UH, WAKE YOU, DID I?

05:25.192 --> 05:26.458
SORT OF.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.365
ARE YOU PACKING OR UNPACKING?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.434
UH, LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.069
YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA MAKE ROOM.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.771
BABIES COME WITH
A LOT OF GEAR.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.274
YEAH, IT'S TIME I GET RID
OF SOME OF THIS DEAD WEIGHT.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.142
WHAT'S IN THERE?

05:44.144 --> 05:46.111
JUNK, MOSTLY.
YEARBOOKS.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.480
BASEBALL GLOVES,
TROPHIES.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.315
STUFF MY MOM PROBABLY
WANTS MORE THAN ME.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.151
LISTEN, CAN YOU, UH,
HOLD THIS FLAP DOWN FOR ME?

05:56.056 --> 06:01.259
( sighs ) IT'S A TAPE GUN,
SPENCE. YOU WON'T GET HURT.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.161
I KNOW THAT.
REALLY?

06:03.163 --> 06:05.430
'CAUSE YOU FLINCH
EVERY TIME I COME NEAR YOU.

06:05.432 --> 06:08.800
HAVE TO GO GET READY
FOR SCHOOL.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.202
YEAH, MELISSA TOLD ME

06:10.204 --> 06:12.804
WHAT YOU SAID TO HER
AT THE SWIM MEET.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.172
YOU THINK I HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH

06:14.174 --> 06:15.707
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALISON DE LAURENTIS?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.810
WELL, FOR THE RECORD,
I DIDN'T...

06:18.812 --> 06:21.146
THOUGH I'M NOT SURPRISED
SHE ENDED UP THAT WAY.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.981
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO ME?

06:22.983 --> 06:26.151
IT MEANS YOUR FRIEND ALISON
WAS A PSYCHO STALKER

06:26.153 --> 06:28.387
WHO WOULDN'T TAKE
NO FOR AN ANSWER.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.122
OKAY, SOMEONE ELSE PROBABLY
HAD ENOUGH OF HER.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.857
YEAH, OR MAYBE YOU
HAD ENOUGH OF HER.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.159
LISTEN, OUR RELATIONSHIP

06:34.161 --> 06:38.830
COULD BE SUMMED UP
IN TWO WORDS: GET LOST.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.867
RIGHT, WELL,
IT'S TOO BAD SHE'S NOT
HERE TO DEFEND HERSELF.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.169
TRUST ME, SHE NEVER
PLAYED THAT POSITION.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.471
YOUR FRIEND ALISON
WAS ALWAYS ON OFFENSE.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.446
DIDN'T I JUST BUY
THIS MILK?

06:54.448 --> 06:56.114
IS IT SOUR?

06:56.116 --> 06:57.482
EMPTY.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.419
AND... SO IS
THE BUTTER DISH.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.220
WHY ARE WE GOING THROUGH
SO MANY GROCERIES?

07:02.222 --> 07:04.956
I MAY HAVE MADE SOME
MAC & CHEESE FOR CALEB AND ME.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.926
HE STAYED OVER FOR DINNER
A COUPLE TIMES.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.327
I THOUGHT WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.463
I'M NOT CRAZY
ABOUT THIS FRIENDSHIP.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.131
MOM, HIS HOME SITUATION SUCKS.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.666
HIS FOSTER PARENTS
TREAT HIM LIKE DIRT.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.401
HANNA, THERE ARE A LOT
OF GREAT FAMILIES OUT THERE

07:16.403 --> 07:18.003
HE COULD BE PLACED WITH,
JUST NOT OURS.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.173
AND... THERE'S
NO SUGAR, EITHER.

07:21.175 --> 07:24.409
UH, YEAH, WE MADE
BROWNIES FOR DESSERT.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.449
SO, I GUESS THIS WOULD BE
A BAD TIME TO SEE

07:30.451 --> 07:33.385
IF HE CAN STAY IN OUR GUESTROOM
FOR A COUPLE NIGHTS?

07:33.387 --> 07:37.189
AH, SO THE CAT IN THE HAT
NOW WANTS ROOM AND BOARD?

07:37.191 --> 07:39.357
HE NEVER ASKED.
I'M ASKING.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.394
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU
EXPECT HIM TO STUDY
OR GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP?

07:42.396 --> 07:44.229
HANNA, WE NEED
OUR PRIVACY.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.331
MRS. POTTER'S NEPHEW
IS STILL CIRCLING OUT THERE.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.866
WE'RE NOT IN THE CLEAR.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.202
I APPLAUD
YOUR COMPASSION,

07:50.204 --> 07:52.170
BUT I WORRY
ABOUT YOUR JUDGMENT.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.005
SO, IS THAT A MAYBE?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.174
AND NOW I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR HEARING.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.276
I'M LATE. I LOVE YOU.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.816
SHE'S GONE.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.722
MORNING.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.357
HOW MUCH DID YOU HEAR?

08:12.359 --> 08:16.094
BETWEEN YOU AND MOMMY?
NOT MUCH.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.698
I WILL, UH, PUT SOME
GROCERIES ON THE BACK PORCH.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.066
MY PARTING GIFT.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.767
CALEB, CHILL.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.402
I'LL TALK TO HER.
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.838
SAID THE GIRL
WITH POOR JUDGMENT
TO THE CAT IN THE HAT.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.946
( knocking )

08:38.085 --> 08:39.951
SURPRISE.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.786
UH, HEY.
WHAT'S THIS?

08:41.788 --> 08:43.822
YOUR NEWSPAPER.
I DON'T SUBSCRIBE.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.157
OH. OOPS.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.359
( chuckles )

08:47.361 --> 08:48.460
HEY.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.798
W-WHAT'S UP?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:53.800 --> 08:57.302
NOTHING. I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU BEFORE SCHOOL.

08:57.304 --> 09:01.139
ABOUT YOUR DAD WANTING TO
TAKE ME OUT FOR THAT BEER?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.074
I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT, ARIA.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.143
I CAN DODGE HIM.
NO, DON'T DODGE HIM.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.679
I WANT YOU TO SPEND
SOME QUALITY TIME WITH HIM.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.214
WHY?
BECAUSE.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.684
IT'D BE COOL IF MY DAD
COULD SEE HOW SPECIAL YOU ARE.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.419
I WANT MY FRIENDS
TO SEE THAT, TOO.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.087
AND WHY DO
WE SUDDENLY CARE

09:16.089 --> 09:17.756
WHAT YOUR FRIENDS
THINK ABOUT ME?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.791
HAVE YOU TOLD THEM
ABOUT US?

09:19.793 --> 09:20.959
MM.

09:20.961 --> 09:24.229
YOUR HOMIES
WILL LIKE ME JUST FINE.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.232
I CAST SPENCER AND HANNA
IN THE SCHOOL PLAY.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.902
REALLY? EXCELLENT.
THEY'LL BE SO PSYCHED.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.238
WHO'S YOUR STAGE MANAGER?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.707
AH, COUPLE OF KIDS
HAVE ASKED. WHY?

09:35.709 --> 09:38.009
WELL, YOU'LL BE SPENDING
EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL

09:38.011 --> 09:41.746
AND WEEKENDS...
SO IF I'M STAGE MANAGING

09:41.748 --> 09:43.315
WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER
ALL THE TIME.

09:43.317 --> 09:44.816
ON CAMPUS.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.953
OFF CAMPUS, TOO.
IT'LL GIVE US AN EXCUSE

09:47.955 --> 09:50.288
TO FINALLY HAVE COFFEE
OUTSIDE THIS LITTLE APARTMENT.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.258
I LOVE THIS
LITTLE APARTMENT.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.492
I DO. A LOT.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.560
ARIA.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.165
COME ON. LET ME BE
YOUR STAGE MANAGER, PLEASE?

10:00.167 --> 10:02.367
PART OF ME SAYS
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.135
BUT I'M NOT TALKING
TO THAT PART.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.705
JUST SAY YES, EZRA.
COME ON, JUST SAY IT.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.473
SAY IT.
YES.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.912
CALEB, CAN YOU GET ME
MY MASCARA?

10:13.914 --> 10:16.014
I'M IN THE SHOWER!

10:16.016 --> 10:18.717
CAN I JUST COME IN
AND GRAB IT?
SURE.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.855
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS
CLEANED THIS SHOWERHEAD,

10:23.857 --> 10:26.157
YOU COULD HAVE
AMAZING PRESSURE.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.059
GO FOR IT.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.694
Mom: HANNA?

10:31.398 --> 10:33.098
IS MY PHONE
IN YOUR BATHROOM?

10:35.902 --> 10:37.802
UM, I-I--
I'M IN THE SHOWER, MOM!

10:43.276 --> 10:45.210
I WAS HALFWAY TO THE BANK

10:45.212 --> 10:46.845
WHEN I REALIZED
I DIDN'T HAVE IT.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.317
WHAT IS WITH THIS CHARGER?

10:52.319 --> 10:53.918
I ONLY HAVE THREE BARS.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.054
UH, I REALLY CAN'T TALK
RIGHT NOW, MOM.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.822
I'M GETTING SHAMPOO
IN MY MOUTH.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.491
OKAY.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.063
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU AT DINNER.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.942
WANNA SHARE A TOWEL, TOO?

11:21.882 --> 11:25.250
THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT'S THE PART YOU
REALLY WANTED, RIGHT?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.519
YEAH! IT'S PRETTY COOL.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.320
( phone ringing )

11:31.158 --> 11:32.991
IF YOU GUYS ARE
ALL INVOLVED,

11:32.993 --> 11:34.859
MAYBE I SHOULD DO
PROPS OR SOMETHING.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.128
WHY IS
PAIGE McCULLERS CALLING?

11:37.130 --> 11:38.930
IS SHE STILL
TORTURING YOU?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.733
NO, SHE'S--
WE'RE COOL NOW.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.270
REALLY? WHAT BROUGHT
YOU CLOSER, HER TRYING
TO DROWN YOU?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.906
SHE'S GOT A COUSIN
IN THE MILITARY,

11:47.908 --> 11:50.141
AND SHE'S KIND OF
ANXIOUS ABOUT IT.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.976
DID YOU AND TOBY
FIGURE OUT

11:51.978 --> 11:54.212
THAT BRAILLE THING YET,
WHAT 214 MEANS?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.980
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP,
HAVE YOU?

11:55.982 --> 11:58.450
DEFINITELY NOT.
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT.

11:58.452 --> 12:01.953
I'M SUPPOSED TO DROP OFF
HIS FRENCH BOOK
AFTER SCHOOL, SO...

12:01.955 --> 12:03.922
CAN I DO IT?

12:03.924 --> 12:06.691
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
SINCE THEY DROPPED
THE CHARGES,

12:06.693 --> 12:08.927
AND I'D KIND OF LIKE
TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.962
YEAH.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.333
MAYBE NOW HE'LL BE
MORE WILLING TO HEAR ME

12:15.335 --> 12:17.335
WHEN I SAY
I DIDN'T TURN HIM IN.

12:21.942 --> 12:26.144
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.012
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY KNEW EACH OTHER.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.917
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.992
WHAT IS THAT?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.927
WHAT DID HE JUST GIVE HER?

12:58.145 --> 13:01.746
SO, THE PLAY RAISES
AN INTERESTING QUESTION.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.949
ARE PEOPLE BORN EVIL,
OR DO THEY LEARN IT?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.718
I BROUGHT
SOME ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

13:06.720 --> 13:09.420
TO GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME BACKGROUND ON THE PERIOD.

13:09.422 --> 13:14.459
<i> ¶ CAN'T SEEM TO FIND</i>
<i> MY WAY AROUND HERE ANYMORE ¶</i>

13:14.461 --> 13:16.995
<i> ¶ ANYMORE ¶</i>

13:16.997 --> 13:18.997
WHAT GIVES, VELMA?

13:18.999 --> 13:21.900
DID YOU HAVE A NASTY DREAM
LAST NIGHT ABOUT SHAGGY?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.268
( sighs )

13:23.270 --> 13:25.069
I WAS IN THE SHOWER
WITH HIM.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.771
OH, TALK ABOUT
A WET DREAM.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.941
NO, IT WASN'T A DREAM.
HE TOOK A SHOWER
AT MY PLACE.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.242
Did you lose your V-card?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.111
NO! NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.013
WELL, THAT WAS
A WASTE OF WATER.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.347
ARE YOU INTO HIM
OR NOT?

13:36.349 --> 13:38.149
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST CONFUSED.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.586
DECIDE SOON. BAD BOY
ONLY SHOWERS ONCE A YEAR.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.690
DO YOU NEED HELP?

13:45.692 --> 13:47.492
OH, NO,
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.994
SO, I RECOMMEND
THAT YOU READ THE NOVEL,

13:49.996 --> 13:53.264
AND TO WHET YOUR APPETITES,
I COPIED THE FIRST CHAP--

14:00.040 --> 14:01.739
I-I GOT IT.
THANKS.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.474
WHY DON'T YOU HAND OUT
THE SCHEDULES?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.714
OH, ARIA, UH,
WHILE YOU'RE UP,

14:09.716 --> 14:11.082
COULD YOU DO ME
A FAVOR?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.151
UH, SURE. WHAT DO
YOU NEED, MONA?

14:13.153 --> 14:16.321
COULD YOU HIT THE VENDY
AND GRAB ME A POWERBAR
AND SOME MINTS?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.790
I THINK I SHOULD
JUST PASS THESE OUT,

14:18.792 --> 14:22.160
BUT EVERYONE CAN
"HIT THE VENDY" WHEN WE
GO ON BREAK, OKAY?

14:25.866 --> 14:28.933
I THINK YOU'LL SEE,
EVEN WITH THE NOVEL,

14:28.935 --> 14:31.703
RHODA IS NOT THE TYPICAL
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.072
ONLY THE JANITOR IS--

14:34.074 --> 14:35.940
YES.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.844
UH, I'M GUESSING THIS ISN'T
THE VARSITY BOOSTER CLUB.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.113
MY BAD. SORRY.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.782
LET'S ALL TAKE A LOOK
AT THE FIRST SCENE

14:44.784 --> 14:47.986
WITH RHODA AND THE JANITOR,
IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE 25.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.420
HE IS SO CREEPY!

14:49.422 --> 14:51.823
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU EVER KISSED HIM.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.258
WE ALL WANTED
TO KISS HIM.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.193
NEVER.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.462
AT THAT FRAT PARTY WHEN HE
WAS BIG MAN ON CAMPUS?

14:57.464 --> 14:59.530
THE ONE THAT ALISON
GOT US INTO?

14:59.532 --> 15:01.332
NOT ME.
YES. YOU.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.671
YOU ARE SO BAD-ASS.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.673
DID YOU MAKE THESE?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.541
WHERE'D YOU GET
THIS PICTURE OF ME?

15:10.543 --> 15:11.709
I LOOK LIKE
MY MOTHER.

15:11.711 --> 15:12.977
THAT IS YOUR MOTHER.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.952
<i> ¶ SHE WOULDN'T</i>
<i> LET ME GO ¶</i>

15:28.194 --> 15:29.761
YEAH!

15:32.432 --> 15:35.466
SO, YOU GUYS CAN
THANK ME LATER.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.602
WAIT! SO...

15:37.604 --> 15:39.537
WHAT DO WE--
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

15:39.539 --> 15:40.805
ACT YOUR NEW AGE.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.176
OH, EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.680
HEY, SPENCE, ISN'T THAT
YOUR SISTER'S NEW BOYFRIEND?

15:48.682 --> 15:51.482
REALLY? THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT. ARE YOU--?

15:51.484 --> 15:54.085
HE'S KINDA CUTE.
SO'S HIS FRIEND.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.054
EASY. HE'S
A LITTLE BIT OLD FOR YOU.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.589
NOT TONIGHT...
'CAUSE I'M 26!

15:58.591 --> 16:00.124
PUT THAT AWAY.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.427
YEAH, AND TAKE
A MATH CLASS.
YOU'RE 21.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.362
( girl giggling )

16:04.364 --> 16:07.532
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
JUST RIGHT UP HERE.

16:07.534 --> 16:11.035
LOOKS LIKE MR. MELISSA
IS GIVING MISS RUM & COKE
A SPECIAL TOUR.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.037
MAYBE HE'S JUST
TAKING HER TO THE BATHROOM.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.039
OR FINDING AN EMPTY ROOM
SO SHE CAN LIE DOWN.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.074
YEAH, ON TOP OF HER.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.078
WHAT?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.513
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU VESTAL VIRGINS,

16:22.515 --> 16:24.749
BUT I'M HERE
TO MAKE SOME MEMORIES.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.118
LET'S DIVIDE AND CONQUER
AND MEET BACK HERE AT MIDNIGHT.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.556
YOU SHOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING
TO YOUR SISTER THAT NIGHT.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.726
LIKE WHAT? "I CRASHED
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S FRAT PARTY"?

16:34.728 --> 16:36.561
I WOULD'VE BEEN SO DEAD.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.196
LIKE YOUR SISTER
ISN'T NOW?

16:38.198 --> 16:40.398
YEAH, KNOCKED UP
WITH HIS BAD SEED.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.468
HANNA, WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT THE JANITOR IN THE PLAY

16:43.470 --> 16:47.405
IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS
THE LITTLE GIRL'S NOT A LIAR?

16:47.407 --> 16:51.743
UM, THAT'S BECAUSE THE JANITOR
IS CHILDLIKE HIMSELF.

16:51.745 --> 16:55.246
IT'S LIKE WHEN WE
WERE READING SHAKESPEARE,

16:55.248 --> 16:57.115
AND EZRA TALKED
ABOUT THE FOOLS

16:57.117 --> 17:00.618
AND HOW THEY CAN
GET AWAY WITH SAYING...

17:00.620 --> 17:04.522
THINGS THAT...
OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.258
LET'S JUST FOCUS
ON THIS PLAY.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.459
OKAY?

17:15.502 --> 17:18.136
HI.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.538
SPENCER ASKED ME
TO DROP OFF YOUR FRENCH BOOK.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.373
THERE A REASON
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.308
NO. NOT AT ALL.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.544
I PRACTICALLY SNATCHED IT
OUT OF HER HAND.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.112
I WANTED TO.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.083
I SHOULD BE
ON YOUR PORCH.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.485
I FOUND OUT
WHO TURNED ME IN.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.654
IT WAS JENNA.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.790
HER WAY OF KEEPING
ME CLOSE TO HOME.

17:42.662 --> 17:46.431
WELL, NO ONE CAN
DO THAT NOW.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.367
IT MUST FEEL GOOD,
KNOWING YOU CAN RIDE THAT
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.202
IT'LL FEEL EVEN BETTER
WHEN I CAN GET IT TO MOVE.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.077
SO, I WAS THINKING...

17:59.079 --> 18:02.547
MAYBE WE COULD GO OUT
SOMETIME AND CELEBRATE,

18:02.549 --> 18:04.248
NOW THAT THIS IS OVER.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.716
WHAT HAPPENED TO MAYA?

18:05.718 --> 18:09.220
I MEANT CELEBRATE
AS FRIENDS.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.255
BREAKFAST OR SOMETHING.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.958
I LIKE BREAKFAST.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.359
TOMORROW?

18:21.734 --> 18:23.634
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE STILL WORKING.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.670
NO, JUST PREPPING.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.005
I LIKE TO FOOL MYSELF
INTO THINKING

18:28.007 --> 18:30.475
THEY ACTUALLY READ SOME
OF THE THINGS I PUT UP HERE.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.276
WELL, HOPE
SPRINGS ETERNAL.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.445
LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE
TEACHING, WRITING,

18:34.447 --> 18:35.780
DIRECTING
THE SCHOOL PLAY.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.815
DO YOU EVEN HAVE TIME
FOR A BEER?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.151
SURE. JUST, UH,
DON'T TELL MY STUDENTS.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.686
IT'LL ONLY MAKE THEM
LOVE YOU MORE,

18:41.688 --> 18:43.654
IF THAT WERE
EVEN POSSIBLE.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.157
MY DAUGHTER THINKS
THAT YOU ARE
PRETTY HOT STUFF.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.391
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:47.393 --> 18:49.127
AFTER READING
YOUR STORIES

18:49.129 --> 18:52.196
THAT ARIA GAVE ME,
I HAVE TO AGREE.

18:52.198 --> 18:56.033
BUT I GOTTA SAY,
IT'S VERY BOLD OF YOU,

18:56.035 --> 18:58.569
EXPOSING YOURSELF
TO YOUR STUDENTS.

18:58.571 --> 19:03.407
COME ON. YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU NEED
THAT BEER.

19:03.409 --> 19:06.611
OKAY, PICK UP THE COAT,
MOVE STAGE LEFT,

19:06.613 --> 19:08.679
AND THEN PUSH HIM
OUT THE DOOR.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.181
CAN HE HAVE
LUNCH FIRST?

19:10.183 --> 19:12.550
I... WASN'T
TALKING TO YOU.

19:12.552 --> 19:15.419
OH, YOU HAVE SOMEONE
CRASHING IN YOUR ATTIC, TOO?

19:15.421 --> 19:17.121
NO. I'M LEARNING
MY LINES.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.357
CAN I HELP?
NOPE.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.759
CAN I MAKE THE SANDWICH?

19:21.761 --> 19:23.161
NO.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.135
SO, HOW WAS
THE REST OF YOUR DAY?

19:31.137 --> 19:33.671
MINE GOT OFF TO
A REALLY STRANGE START.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.073
I WAS TAKING A SHOWER--
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

19:36.075 --> 19:38.643
YOU CAN MAKE A SANDWICH,
AND YOU CAN EAT IT, TOO.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.278
I HAVE TO PRACTICE
BEING DRUNK.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.579
CAN I... HELP?

19:41.581 --> 19:42.547
NO!

19:46.085 --> 19:47.218
THANKS.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.221
HERE YOU GO.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.823
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR WRITING,

19:52.825 --> 19:54.025
YOU SEEM
MUCH MORE RELAXED

19:54.027 --> 19:56.027
THAN WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR DAY JOB.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.462
YOU'RE NOT HIDING OUT
AT THAT HIGH SCHOOL,
ARE YOU?

19:58.464 --> 19:59.797
WHAT?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.832
LISTEN, EZRA, I HAVE KNOWN
MANY GIFTED PEOPLE

20:01.834 --> 20:04.569
WHO WERE TOO SCARED TO BET
ON THEIR OWN TALENT.

20:04.571 --> 20:09.707
NO, NO. NO. NOT ME.
I LOVE TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.142
OH, OF COURSE YOU DO.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.444
I MEAN, EVERYBODY ALWAYS
LOVES THEIR FIRST CLASS.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.213
YOU BOND WITH THEM
IN A SPECIAL WAY,

20:15.215 --> 20:17.882
BUT DON'T FORGET--
THE SAME KIDS

20:17.884 --> 20:20.751
THAT YOU LOVE ARE
GONNA MOVE ON, YOU KNOW?

20:20.753 --> 20:23.721
YOU KNOW,
TIME GOES BY SO FAST.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.123
I MEAN, ARIA'S ALREADY
LOOKING AT COLLEGES
IN CALIFORNIA.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.530
YOU KNOW, IF YOU TAUGHT
AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL,

20:32.532 --> 20:34.198
YOU'D HAVE A LOT MORE
TIME FOR YOUR WRITING.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.903
I NEED YOUR HELP.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.438
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:41.941 --> 20:44.609
I SAW IAN HAND JENNA
A BAG AT SCHOOL.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.878
SO?
WELL, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT WAS IN IT?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.181
NO.
WHY DO THEY EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER?

20:50.183 --> 20:52.683
HE'S A COACH.
WHAT TEAM DOES
SHE PLAY ON?

20:52.685 --> 20:55.052
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO ASK JENNA.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.154
WE'RE NOT TALKING MUCH
THESE DAYS.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.857
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TALK TO HER. JUST...

20:59.859 --> 21:01.759
GET HER PHONE.
WHAT?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.762
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT IF IAN
IS IN HER RECENT CALL LISTS,

21:04.764 --> 21:06.931
AND HANNA HAS A FRIEND
WHO CAN UNLOCK HER PASSWORD.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.433
I'M NOT STEALING
HER PHONE.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.602
TOBY, WE'RE NO CLOSER

21:11.604 --> 21:14.438
TO FIGURING OUT
WHAT 214 MEANS.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.608
IAN MIGHT BE
WHO SHE'S WHISPERING TO
ON THE OTHER END.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.011
I DON'T KNOW.
IF-- I'VE GOTTA BE CAREFUL.

21:20.013 --> 21:22.847
IF I START STEALING--
IF WE DON'T GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS,

21:22.849 --> 21:24.615
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE
WAITING AROUND

21:24.617 --> 21:26.851
FOR THE NEXT PIECE OF
EVIDENCE TO BE PLANTED
IN YOUR ROOM.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.253
UNTIL THEY FIND
THE REAL KILLER,

21:29.255 --> 21:32.556
YOUR NIGHTMARE IS
NEVER GOING TO END.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.860
WE NEED JENNA'S PHONE.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.109
MORNING.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.744
IS THAT EMILY?

21:53.746 --> 21:54.779
YES.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.348
TOBY'S NOT HERE.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.586
OR ARE YOU HERE
TO SEE ME?

22:02.588 --> 22:05.089
HE'S NOT HERE?
WE MADE A--

22:05.091 --> 22:07.591
I SAID I'D TAKE HIM
OUT FOR BREAKFAST.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.660
WELL, HE'S HAVING
THAT WITH SPENCER.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.829
HE LEFT EARLY
THIS MORNING.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.631
SAID HE NEEDED
TO DO HOMEWORK.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.966
IT SUCKS, DOESN'T IT?

22:15.968 --> 22:17.134
WHAT?

22:17.136 --> 22:18.836
FEELING LIKE
YOU'RE SECOND CHOICE.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.876
( playing flute )

22:40.159 --> 22:42.193
HOW SOON CAN
I GET IT BACK?

22:42.195 --> 22:43.728
SHOULDN'T
TAKE HIM LONG.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.968
HAVE YOU EATEN?
YOU WANT SOME TOAST?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.603
IS WHOLE WHEAT OKAY?

22:52.605 --> 22:54.605
SHE GOES BALLISTIC
WHEN I TOUCH HER STUFF.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.475
YEAH, I GET IT.
MY SISTER ONCE THREATENED

22:57.477 --> 22:59.543
TO BREAK MY THUMBS
FOR USING HER HAIRBRUSH.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.084
TOBY, CAN I ASK
YOU SOMETHING?

23:09.422 --> 23:12.156
WHY WAS ALISON
SO SURE IT WAS YOU

23:12.158 --> 23:14.892
SPYING ON US THE NIGHT
OF JENNA'S ACCIDENT?

23:17.797 --> 23:19.663
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T--

23:19.665 --> 23:21.632
I NEVER SPIED
ON ANYONE.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.667
I NEVER LOOKED
IN ANYONE'S WINDOW.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.836
YOUR FRIEND ALISON
MADE THAT UP.

23:25.838 --> 23:29.673
WHY? WHY YOU?

23:29.675 --> 23:32.143
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT
SHE HAD SOMETHING ON ME.

23:32.145 --> 23:34.678
SHE-- SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON,

23:34.680 --> 23:37.047
AND SHE USED IT
AGAINST ME ANYWAY.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.483
WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE SHE
HAD SOMETHING ON ALL OF US.

23:39.485 --> 23:42.153
MAYBE, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LIVE IN A TOWN

23:42.155 --> 23:44.655
WHERE EVERYONE BELIEVES
YOU KILLED HER.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.424
NOT EVERYONE.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.625
YOU DID.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.163
YEAH. I GUESS I DID.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.468
BUT I'M NOT
PROUD OF THAT.

24:01.808 --> 24:05.676
THIS WHOLE ALISON THING

24:05.678 --> 24:07.945
HAS NEVER MADE
ANY SENSE TO ME.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.420
IT STILL DOESN'T.

24:31.904 --> 24:35.172
HEY. YOU'RE...
ALREADY TAPING.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.675
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED ME TO.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.945
I DO. JUST NOT SURE WE'LL HAVE
PEOPLE UP ON THEIR FEET YET.

24:44.517 --> 24:48.419
LOOK. I'M SORRY ABOUT
SLIPPING UP YESTERDAY,

24:48.421 --> 24:51.422
BUT I DON'T THINK
ANYONE PICKED UP ON IT.

24:51.424 --> 24:53.324
OH, THEY DID.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.127
I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL.
I PROMISE.

24:59.799 --> 25:03.601
OH! SO HOW WAS THAT BEER
WITH MY DAD?

25:03.603 --> 25:05.436
WHAT'D YOU TWO
TALK ABOUT?

25:05.438 --> 25:08.939
LOTS OF STUFF.
HE OFFERED TO HELP ME GET
A JOB AT HAWES COLLEGE.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.442
WHY? YOU ALREADY
HAVE A JOB.

25:11.444 --> 25:13.444
BUT THERE'S ONE CLASS
AVAILABLE THERE,

25:13.446 --> 25:15.012
AND IT COULD LEAD
TO SOMETHING MORE.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.549
WHY WOULD YOU NEED
SOMETHING MORE?

25:18.551 --> 25:22.253
TRUTH IS, I...
NEED SOMETHING LESS.

25:22.255 --> 25:25.756
IF I WORKED AT HAWES,
I WOULD HAVE MORE TIME
TO DO MY OWN WRITING.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.859
YEAH, BUT TEACHING HERE
HASN'T KEPT YOU FROM
YOUR WRITING, HAS IT?

25:28.861 --> 25:31.295
NOT ENTIRELY, BUT I GOTTA
THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.398
SO, YOU'RE PLANNING
ON LEAVING HERE?

25:34.400 --> 25:37.334
MAYBE, EVENTUALLY.
BUT YOU ARE, TOO...

25:37.336 --> 25:40.271
LEAVING
EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

25:40.273 --> 25:41.872
( door opens )

25:43.776 --> 25:46.844
OH, HEY, MR. FITZ.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.812
OH, ARIA, UM,
I'M A LITTLE PARCHED.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.181
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO PICK ME UP SOME THROAT COAT?

25:51.183 --> 25:54.818
UM, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
GET YOUR OWN TEA, MONA.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.820
I'M A STAGE MANAGER,
NOT A GOPHER.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.223
WOW. YOU SURE
BITE LIKE ONE.

26:05.698 --> 26:08.799
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
THE YEAR 2020?

26:08.801 --> 26:11.068
IT'S FOR SOMEONE
WHO CAN'T SEE.

26:11.070 --> 26:15.806
OKAY. WELL, SOMEONE WHO CAN,
MIGHT NEED TO CALL NASA
TO TURN IT ON.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.909
UH, TAKE HOWEVER
LONG YOU NEED.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.078
NO. TAKE AN HOUR.
IT HAS TO BE RETURNED

26:21.080 --> 26:23.180
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
OR THE PERSON WHO...

26:23.182 --> 26:25.049
BORROWED IT MIGHT
BE IN TROUBLE.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.384
THEY SHOULD BE.

26:27.386 --> 26:30.321
STEALING A BLIND PERSON'S PHONE?
THAT'S SICK.

26:30.323 --> 26:33.958
WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO
FOR FUN ON THE WEEKENDS,
BREAK OLD LADY'S HIPS?

26:33.960 --> 26:36.493
JUST GIVE IT BACK TO SPENCER
AS SOON AS YOU CAN, OKAY?

26:44.737 --> 26:46.737
WHERE DOES
MY CHARACTER SIT?

26:46.739 --> 26:49.807
UH, I HAVEN'T BLOCKED
IT YET, MONA.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.442
WE'LL GET TO THAT
ON SATURDAY.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.110
FOR THOSE OF YOU
JUST ARRIVING,

26:53.112 --> 26:55.779
THE STAGE HAS BEEN TAPED OFF
TO MARK THE LIVING ROOM,

26:55.781 --> 26:58.482
AND THE PROP TABLE
IS BEING STOCKED AS I SPEAK.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.085
WAIT, THIS SATURDAY?
I CAN'T BE HERE THIS SATURDAY.

27:03.255 --> 27:07.024
I ONLY SENT THE E-MAIL
TO THOSE WHO WERE CALLED
FOR THAT REHEARSAL.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.826
WELL, AM I
CALLED IN OR NOT?

27:08.828 --> 27:10.661
WE'LL BE BLOCKING THAT SCENE
ON SATURDAY.

27:10.663 --> 27:13.631
I THOUGHT
I MENTIONED THAT.
YOU DIDN'T.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.133
MR. FITZ, CAN WE FIND
A WAY TO WORK OUT
THE<i> KINKS</i> IN THE SYSTEM?

27:16.135 --> 27:18.035
I ASSURE YOU, MONA,
FROM THIS POINT ON

27:18.037 --> 27:20.070
ARIA WILL BE
ON TOP OF THINGS.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.973
I JUST NEED
SOME CLARIFICATION

27:22.975 --> 27:24.975
FROM OUR DIRECTOR
ON THE SCHEDULING.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.678
CAN WE TAKE FIVE,
EVERYONE?!

27:27.680 --> 27:29.313
THANKS.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.922
ARE YOU STILL ANGRY
AT ME ABOUT YESTERDAY?

27:38.924 --> 27:41.025
I'M ANGRY AT MYSELF
BECAUSE...

27:41.027 --> 27:43.093
I KNEW THIS WASN'T
GONNA WORK.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.030
FINE. I WILL HELP YOU
FIND A NEW STAGE MANAGER,

27:46.032 --> 27:49.133
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO REPLACE ME
IN OTHER PARTS OF YOUR LIFE.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.367
WHO SAID THAT?
YOU DID.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.636
SUDDENLY, EVERYBODY'S
LEAVING HERE.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.005
AND WHY WERE YOU TALKING

27:55.007 --> 27:56.840
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE
VERSUS OUR FUTURE?

27:56.842 --> 27:59.243
BECAUSE THEY
MAY NOT BE LINKED.

28:01.213 --> 28:04.281
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING
I'M LEAVING HERE TOMORROW,

28:04.283 --> 28:06.116
BUT, LET'S FACE IT--

28:06.118 --> 28:08.252
WE ARE NOT TIED
TO THIS PLACE FOREVER.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.821
YOU'RE LOOKING AT COLLEGES
IN CALIFORNIA,

28:10.823 --> 28:12.322
WHICH YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO DO.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.825
ONE. I LOOKED AT ONE COLLEGE
IN YOUR FAVORITE CITY.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.160
WE COULD
MOVE THERE TOGETHER!

28:16.162 --> 28:17.628
ARIA, THAT'S
NOT HOW IT WORKS.

28:17.630 --> 28:19.163
WHY CAN'T IT
IF WE WANT IT TO?

28:19.165 --> 28:21.098
THE WHOLE POINT OF COLLEGE
IS TO BROADEN YOUR WORLD,

28:21.100 --> 28:23.634
NOT PACK UP YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
ENGLISH TEACHER AND BRING
HIM WITH YOU.

28:23.636 --> 28:26.036
YOU'RE NOT JUST
MY HIGH SCHOOL
ENGLISH TEACHER.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.005
IS THAT HOW YOU
SEE YOURSELF?

28:28.007 --> 28:31.508
NO. BUT YOU WILL,
WHEN THE TIME COMES.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.750
CUTE COUPLE,
AREN'T THEY?

28:39.752 --> 28:41.652
WE SHOULD STUDY
OUR LINES.

28:41.654 --> 28:43.387
YEAH, I STILL DON'T GET
MY SECOND SCENE.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.289
YOUR CHARACTER
IS SUSPICIOUS.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.024
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT
IN THE SCRIPT.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.259
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S
UNDERNEATH THE WORDS.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.028
THAT'S THE REASON
WHY SHE'S DRINKING.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.197
NO, SHE'S DRINKING
BECAUSE HER KID DROWNED.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.232
HANNA, AT THIS POINT
EVEN THE LITTLE GIRL'S

28:55.234 --> 28:57.101
MOTHER THINKS THAT
SHE'S A MURDERER.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.737
IT'S THE DROWNING,
THE OLD LADY WHO
FELL DOWN THE STAIRS,

28:59.739 --> 29:01.371
THE JANITOR
WHO WAS SET ON FIRE...

29:01.373 --> 29:03.073
I WAS JUST TALKING
ABOUT THIS SCENE.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.808
SHE COULD THINK
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.978
MAYBE THERE
ARE NO ACCIDENTS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:07.980 --> 29:11.081
WE NEVER QUESTIONED
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT PARTY.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.717
Ian: ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE
YOU GUYS LATER, OKAY?

29:13.719 --> 29:15.486
HEY, MIKE, I WANT
TO SEE PICTURES.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.591
I REALLY LIKE
THAT TOP, EM...

29:20.593 --> 29:23.560
AND I THINK SOMEONE ELSE
MIGHT LIKE IT, TOO.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.031
NO.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.968
WHY? HE'S DROOLING
IN HIS BEER PONG CUP.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.603
JUST GO TALK TO HIM.
NO.

29:32.605 --> 29:33.771
GO TALK TO HIM!

29:33.773 --> 29:35.572
( thudding, screaming )

29:39.345 --> 29:41.812
ARE YOU OKAY?
DON'T TOUCH HER!

29:41.814 --> 29:42.946
I'M GONNA GO
GET HELP!

29:42.948 --> 29:43.847
SOMEBODY
CALL 911!

29:48.821 --> 29:50.654
SHE'S STILL BREATHING.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.861
WE SHOULD GO. NOW.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.869
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT IAN AT THE TOP
OF THE STAIRS BEFORE?

30:05.871 --> 30:08.605
I... I DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT IT TILL NOW.

30:08.607 --> 30:12.075
WHAT IF THAT GIRL DIDN'T FALL
JUST 'CAUSE SHE WAS WASTED?

30:12.077 --> 30:13.577
( footsteps )

30:13.579 --> 30:15.245
WE'RE... STARTING.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.082
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:19.084 --> 30:22.152
THE NIGHT THAT WE
CRASHED THAT FRAT PARTY.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.755
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?
WE'RE THINKING ALISON

30:24.757 --> 30:26.390
WASN'T THE FIRST PERSON
IAN SHOVED.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.639
<i> ¶ PICK UP THE PHONE ¶</i>

30:44.677 --> 30:48.278
<i> ¶ I'M TRYING TO SAY SORRY ¶</i>

30:48.280 --> 30:51.548
<i> ¶ THE THINGS</i>
<i> THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ¶</i>

30:51.550 --> 30:52.883
( sighs )

30:58.157 --> 31:01.024
I CAN'T DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.
THIS PHONE IS
OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.627
I CAN'T CRACK IT,
AND I KNOW YOU'RE DEALING
WITH A TIME ISSUE.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.496
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GIVE UP?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!

31:06.498 --> 31:08.632
WHY? WHY ARE
YOU BREAKING

31:08.634 --> 31:10.634
AND ENTERING
JENNA CAVANAUGH'S PHONE?

31:10.636 --> 31:12.002
IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.006
HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS JENNA'S?

31:16.008 --> 31:17.708
BECAUSE I'M NOT BLIND.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.646
ARE YOU GONNA GET OVER
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY MORNING?

31:22.648 --> 31:25.215
BECAUSE I CAN HAVE
THAT TATTOO REMOVED.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.784
( chuckles ) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.727
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ARE PEOPLE BORN BAD?

31:36.729 --> 31:39.196
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
FIGURING OUT

31:39.198 --> 31:42.032
WHO'S EVIL
AND WHO'S JUST NAUGHTY.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.434
I THINK YOU KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE, MONA,

31:44.436 --> 31:46.737
BUT LET'S ASK
SOME OF YOUR CASTMATES.

31:46.739 --> 31:49.506
SPENCER. THOUGHTS?

31:49.508 --> 31:53.510
YES. SOME PEOPLE
ARE PURE EVIL.

32:01.654 --> 32:04.888
( siren squawks )

32:11.163 --> 32:12.629
WE SHOULD GET
OUT OF HERE.

32:12.631 --> 32:13.964
THEY'RE GONNA START
QUESTIONING EVERYONE.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.966
WE CAN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT ALISON!

32:15.968 --> 32:17.401
I VOTED
FOR MINI GOLF.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.202
THIS WAS
A HUGE MISTAKE.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.607
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:23.609 --> 32:25.742
YOU MISSED IT?
WHERE WERE YOU?

32:25.744 --> 32:27.945
THAT-- THAT GIRL
THAT WAS WITH IAN--

32:27.947 --> 32:30.180
SHE FELL
DOWN THE STAIRS,
AND IT WAS TERRIBLE.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.582
CAN WE JUST TELL HER
ON THE BUS?

32:32.584 --> 32:35.419
NOTE TO SELF:
DON'T DRINK AND DIVE.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.587
IF MY MOM FINDS OUT
I WAS HERE,

32:37.589 --> 32:39.389
I'M GONNA BE GROUNDED
UNTIL I'M 50.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.258
GUYS, IF WE RUN AWAY
LIKE BABIES,

32:41.260 --> 32:42.492
WE'LL DEFINITELY
BE QUESTIONED.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.733
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

32:49.735 --> 32:52.269
EXCUSE ME. MY FRIENDS AND I
MADE THE MISTAKE

32:52.271 --> 32:54.338
OF HAVING A LITTLE DRINK
BEFORE WE ATE,

32:54.340 --> 32:57.341
AND NONE OF US
FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT
GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.676
CAN WE TROUBLE YOU
FOR A RIDE BACK TO ROSEWOOD?

33:02.548 --> 33:05.148
WHAT-- WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

33:05.150 --> 33:07.417
I'M THINKING WE'RE
NOT TAKING THE BUS.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.286
CHILLAX, LADIES.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.521
THE BOLDER THE MOVE,
THE LESS ANYONE QUESTIONS IT.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.976
I THINK MY CHARACTER'S
BEING TOTALLY SELFISH.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.312
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO PLAY THAT.

33:35.314 --> 33:38.048
MISS VERNE IS PROTECTING
THE FUTURE OF HER SCHOOL, MONA.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.617
SO, IS SHE
FORGIVABLE OR NOT?

33:40.619 --> 33:43.653
IT'S UNFORGIVABLE IF SHE'S
ONLY THINKING OF HERSELF.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.325
LET'S STOP HERE.

33:48.327 --> 33:49.659
THESE ARE
ALL GOOD THOUGHTS.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.561
WE'LL PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF TOMORROW.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.363
STUDY YOUR LINES.
PUT AWAY YOUR PROPS.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.698
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.724
GUYS.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.663
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

34:26.665 --> 34:29.499
WHY WOULD THAT BE IN HERE?
WHAT'S THAT? IS THAT BLOOD?

34:29.501 --> 34:31.301
EM, WHERE DID
YOU GET THIS?

34:31.303 --> 34:33.103
I DIDN'T! I'VE NEVER
SEEN IT BEFORE.

34:34.940 --> 34:38.208
OH, GOD, NO.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.644
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT IAN USED--
TO KILL ALISON, DON'T YOU?

34:40.646 --> 34:43.680
GUYS, SLOW DOWN. WE DON'T KNOW
THAT THAT'S ALISON'S BLOOD.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.649
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THAT IS BLOOD.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.984
YEAH, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT.

34:47.986 --> 34:49.719
THAT'S INSANE.

34:49.721 --> 34:53.056
WHY WOULD HE HIDE THAT
IN HERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE?

34:53.058 --> 34:56.193
BECAUSE IT'S A BOLD MOVE,
AND NO ONE WOULD EVER
LOOK FOR IT HERE.

34:56.195 --> 34:59.196
WHY DID THE BAD SEED
HIDE THE MEDAL IN THE BOX
ON TOP OF HER DESK?

34:59.198 --> 35:00.397
WHY DIDN'T SHE
JUST BURY IT?

35:00.399 --> 35:02.032
BECAUSE SHE WAS EIGHT!

35:02.034 --> 35:03.400
GUYS, WE ALL SAW
THAT VIDEO.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.402
IAN DID NOT HAVE
A TROPHY IN HIS HAND.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.704
Emily: WE DIDN'T SEE
WHAT WAS ON THE GROUND.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.272
IT COULD'VE BEEN
IN HIS LUGGAGE.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.074
THIS WAS WHEN
THEY WERE TOGETHER
AT HILTON HEAD.

35:11.076 --> 35:12.409
WOW.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.244
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.912
WE HAND IT IN.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.115
WE'RE NOT WASTING TIME
LOSING EVIDENCE AGAIN.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.449
EMILY'S RIGHT.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.084
THIS GOES
TO THE POLICE NOW.

35:42.407 --> 35:45.475
Emily: SO, WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

35:45.477 --> 35:47.144
Spencer: JUST WAIT.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.612
Aria: HOW LONG
UNTIL THE POLICE

35:48.614 --> 35:50.447
FIGURE OUT THAT
IT'S ALISON'S BLOOD?

35:50.449 --> 35:52.015
I DON'T KNOW.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.151
I'LL TELL YOU THIS--
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.553
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE IAN IS.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.988
YOU CAN STAY
AT MY PLACE.

35:57.990 --> 36:01.491
COULD WE JUST
ALL STAY AT YOUR PLACE?

36:01.493 --> 36:04.561
I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST FEELS
WEIRD SPLITTING UP AFTER THIS.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.535
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE HAD IT,

36:11.537 --> 36:13.737
THE WEAPON,
IN OUR HANDS.

36:15.374 --> 36:18.441
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
IT'S LIKE...

36:18.443 --> 36:21.411
LIKE ALI CAN FINALLY
REST IN PEACE.

36:21.413 --> 36:24.214
YEAH. WE ALL CAN.

36:28.220 --> 36:31.488
WE'LL PICK UP SOME FOOD
ON THE WAY TO EMILY'S.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.590
I-I CAN'T STAY
OVER TONIGHT.

36:33.592 --> 36:36.226
LOOK, BELIEVE ME,
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME EITHER,

36:36.228 --> 36:38.461
BUT MY MOM HEARS
SOMETHING IN THE BASEMENT...

36:38.463 --> 36:39.829
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER
ABOUT CALEB?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.498
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
I CAN DO IN ONE DAY, OKAY?

36:43.902 --> 36:47.571
ACTUALLY, CAN WE JUST MAKE
ONE STOP ALONG THE WAY?

36:47.573 --> 36:49.506
I-I PROMISE
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

36:49.508 --> 36:50.607
YEAH, SURE.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.315
WAIT, EM.
WE DIDN'T CALL TOBY.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.883
WHAT?

36:59.885 --> 37:02.018
WE HAVE TO TELL HIM
WHAT WE FOUND.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.754
YOU TELL HIM.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.123
THAT SHOULD BE YOU.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.962
( knocking )

37:13.599 --> 37:15.799
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT I'M--

37:15.801 --> 37:17.968
I'M NOT SLEEPING TONIGHT
UNTIL I SAY THIS.

37:17.970 --> 37:21.304
TAKE YOUR COAT OFF.
SIT DOWN.
NO, NO.
I'M NOT STAYING.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.540
I JUST CAME HERE TO SAY
THAT I SIGNED UP

37:23.542 --> 37:25.442
FOR THE PLAY FOR ALL
THE WRONG REASONS,

37:25.444 --> 37:26.710
SO I'M OFFICIALLY DONE.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.478
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT WAS
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.580
ARIA--
BUT YOU WERE WRONG TOO...

37:30.582 --> 37:33.216
ABOUT THE FUTURE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

37:33.218 --> 37:35.585
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW.
NOBODY DOES.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.487
MY FRIEND ALISON,
SHE DIDN'T.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.290
SHE DIDN'T GET A FUTURE.
SHE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO TURN 16.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.528
LISTEN--
NO, BUT LET ME FINISH.

37:45.529 --> 37:46.895
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA
END UP IN CALIFORNIA,

37:46.898 --> 37:51.368
OR SOME FISHING VILLAGE
IN GUAM-- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.470
WE'RE BOTH HERE NOW.

37:53.472 --> 37:56.706
CAN'T WE JUST BE HAPPY
THAT WE HAVE THAT?

38:08.253 --> 38:09.853
GOOD ANSWER.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.248
DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING
THAT WASN'T MINE, OFFICER.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.051
ARE YOU LEAVING?

38:42.587 --> 38:44.220
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE RELIEVED.

38:44.222 --> 38:45.689
WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

38:45.691 --> 38:48.425
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
TREATING ME

38:48.427 --> 38:50.026
LIKE SOMETHING
YOU SCRAPE OFF YOUR SHOE?

38:52.331 --> 38:54.564
AT LEAST,
SINCE OUR SHOWER.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.733
LOOK...

38:56.735 --> 38:59.903
I KNOW. I JUST...

38:59.905 --> 39:01.805
I WASN'T...

39:01.807 --> 39:04.407
READY TO SEE
THAT MUCH OF ME?

39:04.409 --> 39:06.042
NO.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.847
YES.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.116
WHAT, AND NOW YOU THINK
YOU HAVE TO THROW DOWN, TOO?

39:14.886 --> 39:17.153
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO?

39:17.155 --> 39:18.822
IT'S OKAY.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.793
WHAT IF I DO WANT TO?

39:25.797 --> 39:27.931
THAT'S OKAY, TOO.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.220
DID YOU GUYS
SLEEP AT ALL?

39:50.222 --> 39:52.789
NO. JUST TOSSED
AND TURNED.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.225
SHE TOSSED.
I TURNED.

39:55.227 --> 39:58.261
I CANNOT WAIT FOR HIM
TO BE CARTED OUT OF HERE.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.597
JUST KNOWING THAT HE'S
IN THIS BUILDING NOW--

40:00.599 --> 40:02.365
THINKING HE COULD
GET AWAY WITH IT.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.267
HER BLOOD
IN THAT TROPHY CASE.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.402
MAKES ME SICK.

40:05.404 --> 40:06.536
GUYS.

40:08.840 --> 40:12.041
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE GOING TO DRAG HIM OUT
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.515
WHY IS HE COMING
OVER HERE?

40:18.517 --> 40:20.450
LADIES.

40:20.452 --> 40:23.720
WHICH ONE OF YOU
FOUND THE TROPHY?

40:23.722 --> 40:25.522
WHO'S, UH, SPENCER HASTINGS?

40:28.427 --> 40:30.427
SO, WAS THIS A GROUP EFFORT,

40:30.429 --> 40:32.529
OR ARE YOU THREE JUST
ALONG FOR THE RIDE?

40:32.531 --> 40:34.364
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:34.366 --> 40:36.366
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD'VE
DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH.

40:36.368 --> 40:39.602
THERE'S NO GOLF TOURNAMENT
ON HILTON HEAD ON THAT DATE.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.538
WHAT ABOUT
THE BLOOD?

40:41.540 --> 40:42.639
IT'S NOT HUMAN BLOOD.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.810
COMES FROM A RAT.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.912
NO, BUT WHY
WOULD THERE--

40:48.914 --> 40:51.981
LET'S SAVE OUR QUESTIONS
FOR THE PRECINCT.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.650
FOLLOW ME.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.871
Cop: DETECTIVE BREYER?

41:16.408 --> 41:18.508
( phones chirping )

41:24.950 --> 41:26.683
Hanna: "A" PLANTED
THAT TROPHY.

41:26.685 --> 41:27.951
Aria:
WE SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

41:36.628 --> 41:41.831
GUYS, WHERE WAS
SHE THAT NIGHT?

41:41.833 --> 41:43.867
AT THE FRAT PARTY
WHEN THE GIRL FELL,

41:43.869 --> 41:45.301
WHERE WAS ALISON?

41:45.303 --> 41:46.870
SHE WASN'T WITH US.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.372
SHE WASN'T
WITH US, EITHER.

41:49.374 --> 41:52.308
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

41:52.310 --> 41:56.312
I'M SAYING MAYBE IT WASN'T
IAN WHO PUSHED THAT GIRL.

41:56.314 --> 41:59.582
MAYBE-- MAYBE THAT DRUNK GIRL
WAS JUST IN ALISON'S WAY.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.251
Hanna: WHY WOULD
ALISON DO THAT?

42:01.253 --> 42:03.720
BECAUSE THAT FRAT PARTY
WASN'T A RANDOM PICK.

42:03.722 --> 42:06.589
SHE TOOK US THERE
BECAUSE SHE WANTED
TO SEE IAN.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.358
MAYBE SHE
WAS STALKING HIM.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.226
WAIT, SO NOW YOU
BELIEVE IAN?

42:10.228 --> 42:11.694
YOU DON'T THINK
HE KILLED ALISON?

42:11.696 --> 42:15.231
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I THINK HE KILLED HER.

42:15.233 --> 42:18.601
THERE'S JUST A LOT
ABOUT THAT NIGHT THAT
WAS STILL DON'T KNOW.

42:18.603 --> 42:21.170
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT?

42:21.172 --> 42:24.173
WHAT IF JENNA WAS ALSO
BLOCKING HER WAY TO IAN?

42:24.175 --> 42:26.142
WHAT IF ALI THREW
THAT FIRECRACKER

42:26.144 --> 42:28.711
IN TOBY'S GARAGE
KNOWING THAT JENNA
WAS IN THERE?

42:28.713 --> 42:31.981
SHE HAD US ALL FOOLED...
UNTIL NOW.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.372
( squeaking )
