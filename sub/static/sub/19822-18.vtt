00:01.736 --> 00:04.603
(distorted voice) So, you
want to hear the true story

00:04.672 --> 00:07.506
about the Hunter fortune.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.709
It's a tragic tale about love gone bad.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.112
It's about a handsome and
passionate young man

00:13.180 --> 00:15.347
who falls in love with a
beautiful young woman

00:15.416 --> 00:17.049
who cannot love him back

00:17.118 --> 00:21.520
because she is married to his
step-brother, Case Hunter.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.323
Poor Jan Saganash's heart was broken

00:24.392 --> 00:27.760
by the wife of his best friend
and brother by marriage.

00:27.828 --> 00:31.764
Case Hunter and Jan Saganash
were step-brothers?

00:31.832 --> 00:32.831
Mm-hmm.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.135
And-and Case Hunter's wife

00:36.203 --> 00:37.503
was Josephine, right?

00:37.571 --> 00:40.072
Can we get back to the story, please?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.341
Josephine loved her husband,

00:42.410 --> 00:46.412
but she also couldn't deny
that she loved Jan Saganash.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.946
That's so sad.

00:48.015 --> 00:51.016
Anika, you're a Hunter.
You're on our side, remember?

00:51.085 --> 00:52.551
Oh, right.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.886
But it's still sad.

00:53.954 --> 00:57.756
When Josephine chose Case
and bore him two children,

00:57.825 --> 01:01.360
Jan Saganash couldn't bear to
stay in Amsterdam any longer.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.029
With a broken heart, he left Amsterdam

01:04.098 --> 01:05.831
on a ship named after his love.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.666
The "Josephine!"

01:07.735 --> 01:09.401
(Tess) Keep going, Sophie.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.303
(regular voice) That was
the end of the story.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.771
(groans) Wow!

01:12.840 --> 01:14.540
That voice distorter is so cool.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.010
New state-of-the-art technology.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.312
(distorted voice) Hello.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.347
Wait, wait, wait, what does
Brule have to do with this?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.651
My father hired him
to do stuff for him.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.586
They have something in common.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.088
They both want this house.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.457
But my father wants something bigger.

01:31.525 --> 01:35.427
Whoever finds the deed to the
Hunter house and signs it

01:35.496 --> 01:38.964
inherits the whole Hunter fortune.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.699
Wait, not just the house?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.201
Everything.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.503
Well, we have to find the
deed before your father does.

01:44.572 --> 01:45.704
Did he tell you where to look?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.406
The map he stole for you in the maze

01:47.475 --> 01:48.874
didn't make any sense.

01:48.943 --> 01:52.311
That's why I broke in
here, to look for clues.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.414
And diamonds.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.450
Do you have them? Any of them?

01:58.519 --> 01:59.618
Well...

01:59.687 --> 02:02.488
Wait. Don't say anything.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.123
You don't trust me?

02:04.191 --> 02:05.991
Why should we?

02:08.262 --> 02:10.362
All my life,

02:10.431 --> 02:14.766
I thought that a Hunter was a
really mean and bad person,

02:14.835 --> 02:17.169
full of hatred for the Saganash name.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.937
And then Tess told me

02:19.006 --> 02:21.740
that you hadn't even heard
of the name Saganash

02:21.809 --> 02:23.775
before all of this started.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.378
And now I feel really bad about
everything that's happened.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.814
I let myself be a part of it

02:28.883 --> 02:32.317
because I thought I had no choice,

02:32.386 --> 02:34.186
because I am a Saganash.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.791
We gotta talk this over.
Could you give us a second?

02:39.860 --> 02:42.361
(doorbell rings)

02:42.429 --> 02:44.062
What if it's my father?

02:44.131 --> 02:46.532
(stuttering) S-Saganash?

02:46.600 --> 02:49.301
Relax. I doubt he would show up here.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.304
But we should still hide you anyway.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.376
And a very good morning to you.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.977
What do you want, Brule?

02:59.046 --> 03:01.813
Oh, wait, it's gonna
be a terrible morning.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.982
What are you talking about?

03:04.051 --> 03:05.884
This.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.187
It's a eviction notice.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.622
You're ordered to leave
this house immediately.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.564
This doesn't make any sense.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.032
Doesn't it?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.500
No, you obviously just
typed that up yourself.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.268
Did I now?

03:23.337 --> 03:25.771
Look, you can't just
make us leave, okay?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.973
Erik and Kate would never...
Erik and Kate would never what?

03:28.042 --> 03:30.209
Where are Erik and Kate anyway?

03:30.277 --> 03:32.144
Haven't seen 'em for quite some time.

03:32.213 --> 03:35.247
Have they abandoned
such charming children?

03:35.316 --> 03:37.416
Perhaps I should call Child Services.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.719
I think they'd be very
disturbed to hear

03:40.788 --> 03:43.055
that five youngsters are
living all by themselves.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.357
Well...

03:49.196 --> 03:50.896
Oh, you think that's the only copy?

03:50.965 --> 03:53.565
(laughs) Sweet.

Yeah, right! You're trained.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.664
Wah dojo.

No, my father never actually
let me do any sports.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.135
And he never let me
go to school either.

05:37.204 --> 05:41.173
So I was tutored at home and...

05:41.241 --> 05:43.208
In the meantime, I just watched

05:43.277 --> 05:45.677
every single kung-fu
movie I could find.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.145
You didn't go to school?

05:49.083 --> 05:51.183
How did you make friends?

05:54.221 --> 05:56.421
Oh. Hey, hey.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.225
Well, uh...

06:00.294 --> 06:01.860
you're really good at martial arts.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.131
Thank you, sensei.

have to leave the house?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.267
Where are we supposed to go?

06:09.336 --> 06:10.469
Hey, nowhere, okay?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.003
We barricade the windows and doors

06:12.072 --> 06:13.972
and just sit tight until
Erik and Kate come back.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.207
How big were his two henchmen?

06:15.275 --> 06:17.909
Don't worry about that, okay?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.111
They didn't look like geniuses.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.313
We can outsmart them. Brule, too.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.347
Okay.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.683
So, we're just supposed
to hole up in here

06:24.752 --> 06:25.984
until who knows when?

06:26.053 --> 06:27.819
It could be weeks before
they get back, maybe months.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.921
I once heard about a guy
who was stuck at school

06:29.990 --> 06:31.456
for a hundred years.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.024
Now he's nothing more than a skeleton

06:33.093 --> 06:35.560
in the biology classroom.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.096
Really.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.398
All right. Um...

06:39.466 --> 06:41.066
Tess, Anika, why don't you guys

06:41.135 --> 06:42.501
go gather some information about Brule.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.503
Maybe there's something we
can use to blackmail him.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.570
Anything to get him off our case.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.972
What about me?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.040
Yeah, and what about Sophie?
What do we do about her?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.675
She can stay here for now.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.977
And, Daniel, you keep an eye on her.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.780
I bet he'll keep more
than an eye on her.

06:54.848 --> 06:55.881
Huh?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.482
He'll keep his lips on her, too.

06:57.551 --> 07:02.087
Come on. Sal, we gotta work on
the perfect defense mechanism.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.890
Hey, you ever heard of McMacho?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.057
Mack who?

Dude, I can't believe you've
never watched McMacho.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.029
It was such a good show.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.697
You never saw the one where McMacho

07:12.766 --> 07:14.132
disarmed an atom bomb with nothing more

07:14.201 --> 07:17.335
than a mozzarella stick
and some dental floss?

07:17.404 --> 07:18.737

07:18.806 --> 07:21.373

07:21.442 --> 07:24.075
See, McMacho would know
how to create a trap

07:24.144 --> 07:25.444
for anyone who tried to come in here.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.979

07:32.085 --> 07:33.952
Because I'm not fictional.

Everybody knows the show.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.698
But it's totally fake.

him, his very real henchmen

07:56.376 --> 07:57.876
are gonna come bursting in here.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.479
That's what I'm saying. If
we do this McMacho style,

08:00.547 --> 08:03.482
we'll take these clown down
and deliver maximum pain.

Fear is way more powerful than pain.

run away so fast,

08:08.722 --> 08:10.422
it'll make their head spin.

Nobody makes people run
away like McMacho.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.960
Do you think that's the deed?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.996
Turn it over.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.235
"My dearest brother.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.940
"Though I am deeply wounded
by your actions towards me,

11:49.009 --> 11:51.810
"I swore to our parents to
always take care of you.

11:51.878 --> 11:56.614
"Therefore, our fortune
we shall always share.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.350
"In your hand I place the deed

11:59.419 --> 12:03.755
"that will grant us
such for all eternity.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.591
"Please, my brother,
join me in signing it.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.526
Your truly, Case Hunter."

12:08.595 --> 12:10.729
I don't understand.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.697
Case says Jan deeply wounded him.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.966
It sounds like he found out

12:15.035 --> 12:16.968
about Jan and Josephine's secret love.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.070
But he didn't hold it against him.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.606
He was still willing to
share the family fortune.

12:21.675 --> 12:24.042
All they had to do was
sign the deed together.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.510
But it was never signed,

12:25.579 --> 12:27.545
because Jan disappeared at sea.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.749
(pounding)

12:32.052 --> 12:33.017
Someone's at the door.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.286
(all) Brule!

12:35.355 --> 12:38.123
He's early! We still have 51
minutes and four seconds left!

12:38.191 --> 12:40.759
Doesn't matter to me!
I'm ready! Are you?

12:40.827 --> 12:42.127
I was born ready!

12:42.195 --> 12:44.863
Come on! To the command post!

12:51.004 --> 12:52.504
(click)

12:59.045 --> 13:01.012
They don't look like
too much to handle.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.415
Why don't I just go and
rearrange their faces.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.885
There's no need for that.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.820
I got everything under control.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.456
Step one:

13:11.525 --> 13:13.758
Disorientation.

13:13.827 --> 13:14.793
(beep)

13:19.399 --> 13:22.066
Step two: Horror sound effects.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.969
Transition from disorientation to fear.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.107
(eerie music playing)

13:29.176 --> 13:32.944
(groaning, shouting)

13:33.013 --> 13:36.214
(shouting)

13:36.283 --> 13:37.415
Step three:

13:37.484 --> 13:40.518
Let the blood bath ensue.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.555
Really just tomato juice and ketchup.

13:43.623 --> 13:44.556

Brule: <i> Go around the back!</i>

14:10.050 --> 14:11.416
That was amazing, Sal.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.284
Science.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.553
Yo, you should get some
tight jeans and a mullet

14:15.622 --> 14:17.455

14:23.096 --> 14:24.629
Idiots.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.698
They're coming in the back.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.366
All right, I'm on it.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.601
All right.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.870
I'm bringin' the pain...

14:31.938 --> 14:33.238

"McMacho": Season 16, episode 13.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.713
I may have sampled it.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.948
Occasionally.

They're in.

All right, how about some
flowers for our guests?

14:58.632 --> 15:01.132
Flowers? Oh, did I say flowers?

15:01.201 --> 15:03.501
I meant flour. (beep)

15:05.405 --> 15:07.038
(all) Oh!

15:08.608 --> 15:10.875
Little ghost pepper
extract on the doorknobs.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.076
Works every time.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.679

15:46.546 --> 15:48.646
You guys didn't find any

15:48.715 --> 15:50.415
For such a bad guy, he
sure does a good job

15:50.483 --> 15:52.150
of keeping himself out of trouble.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.519
Nobody has a bad word to say about him.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.154
They must be afraid of him.

15:59.359 --> 16:02.160
What if we could get him to say
something bad about himself?

16:02.228 --> 16:03.795
Huh?

16:03.863 --> 16:05.430
You know, get him to confess
the whole stupid plan

16:05.498 --> 16:06.664
and then secretly record him.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.866
Good idea, but he wouldn't
admit to anything.

Not to us, but...

16:11.304 --> 16:12.437

hears about any of this.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.246
Of course not. Dude, I'm...

21:22.315 --> 21:23.814
Okay, okay, all right, all right.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.716
We got to get back to
looking for the deed.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.219
At least we have a clue.
So, who's got the letter?

21:28.288 --> 21:30.421
Oh, no.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.056
What's wrong?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.524
I...

21:33.593 --> 21:35.159
I gave it to Sophie.

21:35.228 --> 21:38.462
Last night. She said she
waned to see it and...

21:38.531 --> 21:41.132
She took it and ran off?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.600
No, she wouldn't do that.

21:42.669 --> 21:46.137
She didn't run off, she-she
came back, remember?

21:46.205 --> 21:48.339
There's a reason she came
back the first time.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.977
So we trusted her.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.745
(Anika) And we did.
