WEBVTT

00:06.010 --> 00:07.969
[Clary] <i>Previously
on Shadowhunters...</i>

00:08.054 --> 00:11.223
He's Valentine's son.
We were trained to do the impossible.

00:11.307 --> 00:13.507
[Clary] Jonathan attacked Max
and came for the Mirror...

00:13.559 --> 00:15.811
[Alec] He's not getting out alive.
You forgot something.

00:15.894 --> 00:17.247
[Sebastian groans] [guard]
Go, go, go!

00:17.271 --> 00:18.271
[Clary grunts]

00:18.939 --> 00:20.566
[grunts] [Sebastian groans]

00:21.442 --> 00:23.319
[Clary grunts]
[Alec] Go after him.

00:23.902 --> 00:25.612
Doesn't it seem strange
that Clary's runes

00:25.696 --> 00:27.906
would be powerful enough to
destroy a Mortal Instrument?

00:27.989 --> 00:30.326
I didn't destroy the Mirror.
The Mirror is Lake Lyn.

00:33.037 --> 00:34.830
[Sebastian screaming]

00:40.627 --> 00:42.338
[grunting]

00:51.012 --> 00:52.306
[panting]

00:52.848 --> 00:54.225
We need to leave.

00:54.933 --> 00:57.978
What happened?
My position within the Institute was...

00:58.854 --> 00:59.855
compromised.

01:00.439 --> 01:01.565
Where's the Mirror?

01:04.318 --> 01:06.487
I said, where is it?

01:07.404 --> 01:09.823
Clary, uh, took it from me.

01:09.906 --> 01:12.201
You know, in all honesty,
I would have figured Jace

01:12.284 --> 01:15.329
to be the only Shadowhunter capable
of giving you a run for your money.

01:15.912 --> 01:17.724
It's only a matter of
time before the Institute

01:17.748 --> 01:19.166
comes breaking down that door.

01:19.250 --> 01:23.504
See, I wonder... I wonder how
they learned where you live, huh?

01:23.587 --> 01:26.840
Okay, being discovered
wasn't part of my plan!

01:27.466 --> 01:29.468
But killing you, it was.

01:31.052 --> 01:32.304
[breathing heavily]

01:32.388 --> 01:35.641
Then it would seem you have
some issues with followthrough.

01:36.225 --> 01:37.225
Doesn't it?

01:41.147 --> 01:42.189
Clary, don't.

01:42.273 --> 01:45.025
No, I knew there was something off
about Sebastian, or Jonathan. I...

01:45.109 --> 01:46.709
I should have never
secondguessed myself.

01:46.777 --> 01:48.838
He would have found his way into
our lives one way or another.

01:48.862 --> 01:51.582
The only thing that matters now is
taking Jonathan and Valentine out.

01:55.994 --> 01:57.037
Jonathan!

02:01.167 --> 02:02.584
Turn around and face us.

02:02.668 --> 02:03.919
Where's Valentine?

02:14.555 --> 02:15.806
[chair creaking]

02:22.688 --> 02:23.772
[sighing]

02:26.233 --> 02:28.068
What, did Valentine kill him?

02:28.152 --> 02:29.695
[sighs] He's been dead for days.

02:31.363 --> 02:33.031
Tortured first.

02:33.114 --> 02:35.909
[sighs] This was the
real Sebastian Verlac.

02:44.084 --> 02:46.044
Ave atque vale.

02:46.878 --> 02:48.088
[all] Hail and farewell.

02:54.177 --> 02:55.177
Jace.

02:56.847 --> 02:58.181
[growling]

03:03.270 --> 03:05.897
It's a possessing demon.
The same kind that murdered my mom.

03:05.981 --> 03:07.107
Then we know how to kill it.

03:09.568 --> 03:11.528
[grunts] [groaning and gasping]

03:18.744 --> 03:20.621
We'll make 'em pay for
what they did to you.

03:22.373 --> 03:24.916
We're going to make
them pay for everything.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.600
== Sync,
Corrected by Prabhat Rana ==

03:49.566 --> 03:52.528
[computer beeps] Have you
notified the Verlac family yet?

03:52.611 --> 03:54.238
The Penhallow daughter, Aline,

03:54.321 --> 03:56.740
will deliver the message in
person, Madam Inquisitor.

03:57.366 --> 04:00.869
Defiling the body of a fallen soldier
and turning it into a booby trap

04:00.952 --> 04:03.997
is sadly par for the course
for Valentine, isn't it?

04:04.080 --> 04:06.142
A possessing demon wouldn't
have done this on its own.

04:06.166 --> 04:09.044
The trap could only have been set
using the Mortal Cup to command it.

04:09.127 --> 04:11.046
So he had it all along.

04:11.129 --> 04:13.649
And our intel shows he's also in
possession of the Mortal Sword.

04:14.090 --> 04:16.343
Do you have any good news for me
today, Mr. Lightwood?

04:16.427 --> 04:18.762
Valentine and Jonathan believe
that the New York Institute

04:18.845 --> 04:20.197
is in possession of
the Mortal Mirror.

04:20.221 --> 04:21.661
They won't leave
the city without it.

04:21.723 --> 04:24.393
Thank the Angel that at least
he wasn't able to find that.

04:24.476 --> 04:26.562
We were. Clary?

04:27.563 --> 04:29.315
My connection with the
angel led us to it.

04:29.940 --> 04:30.982
It's in Idris.

04:31.066 --> 04:32.568
The Mirror is Lake Lyn.

04:34.403 --> 04:38.031
That's the very same water
that Raziel first rose from.

04:38.114 --> 04:39.741
Who else knows about this?

04:39.825 --> 04:43.537
Unfortunately, the number of people we
can trust is getting smaller by the day.

04:44.204 --> 04:46.247
We thought it best
to tell you first.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.418
And we'd like to
officially request

04:49.501 --> 04:52.713
soldiers from the Gard to be placed in
the surrounding woods around the lake.

04:52.796 --> 04:56.132
It may only be a matter of time before
Valentine realizes he's been had.

04:56.216 --> 04:59.636
I'll speak to Consul Malachi
about deployment at once.

05:00.846 --> 05:01.930
Good hunting.

05:04.725 --> 05:05.851
So what do we do now?

05:06.518 --> 05:09.020
There's only nine million
people in the metro area.

05:09.104 --> 05:10.814
How hard could it
be to find two?

05:10.897 --> 05:12.483
This job is too big to go alone.

05:12.566 --> 05:15.319
We need to ask for help.
From who, Alec?

05:18.113 --> 05:19.114
From everyone.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.201
After the night is through,
you're gonna wish you had these.

05:29.666 --> 05:32.378
Look, just because you're not
willing to face Alec sober,

05:32.461 --> 05:34.230
doesn't mean the rest of
us shouldn't walk into

05:34.254 --> 05:36.339
this emergency council
meeting levelheaded.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.966
No need to be hurtful.

05:39.092 --> 05:41.887
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was a long night with the cubs.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.096
Where's Meliorn?

05:44.765 --> 05:47.518
The queen will be attending this
very special meeting in his place.

05:47.601 --> 05:50.270
And exactly how do you know that?
She told me.

05:51.312 --> 05:55.401
And I'd suggest you both cozy up to
her, sooner rather than later.

05:55.484 --> 05:56.610
She's a fanatic.

05:56.693 --> 05:58.404
Valentine is a fanatic.
[stammers]

05:58.487 --> 06:00.214
The Clave is filled to
the gills with fanatics.

06:00.238 --> 06:03.366
The queen is simply a woman
with a strong point of view.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.036
Does that strong point of view
differ from breaking the Accords?

06:06.119 --> 06:09.164
Because last time I checked, war with
the Clave is the order of the day.

06:09.247 --> 06:11.542
Unless Valentine succeeds
in raising Raziel.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.334
Kills everyone with
demon blood first.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.129
In which case,

06:16.212 --> 06:19.299
she'd like to offer the entire Downworld
protection in the Seelie Realm.

06:19.382 --> 06:20.717
She insists the court has been

06:20.801 --> 06:23.512
beyond the reach of the angels and
their power for quite some time.

06:23.595 --> 06:26.097
So we live in safety
as, what, her subjects?

06:26.682 --> 06:30.060
"Loyal guests" is how she worded it
when I brought up the same concern.

06:30.143 --> 06:32.729
Oh. Mmmhmm.
[Scoffs] And you believed her?

06:33.689 --> 06:35.524
I believe that
Seelies cannot lie.

06:38.652 --> 06:40.153
[sighs] Look...

06:41.822 --> 06:45.033
No pressure,
but I have already accepted her offer

06:45.116 --> 06:47.619
on behalf of the warlock
community in Brooklyn.

06:51.081 --> 06:52.082
What's the catch?

06:54.375 --> 06:55.836
You're gonna want
that drink now.

07:04.970 --> 07:07.013
Where, oh, where is Simon?

07:08.181 --> 07:11.059
Your Highness,
what an unpleasant surprise.

07:11.602 --> 07:13.394
Well,
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

07:13.479 --> 07:15.856
No offense, Alec,
but I agree with Clary.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.192
Your Majesty, is this another
one of your little games?

07:19.275 --> 07:22.821
The Institute called an emergency
meeting of the Downworld Council.

07:23.447 --> 07:25.198
I speak on behalf
of the Downworld.

07:28.284 --> 07:29.536
Magnus, is this true?

07:30.120 --> 07:32.515
[Seelie Queen] Henceforth,
when you need anything from the Downworld,

07:32.539 --> 07:33.939
you shall address
me, Mr. Lightwood.

07:33.999 --> 07:35.959
Such is the nature
of our new agreement.

07:36.793 --> 07:41.047
Your Highness, Valentine believes that
the Institute has the Mortal Mirror

07:41.131 --> 07:42.900
and he's not going to
leave this city without it.

07:42.924 --> 07:44.736
I would like the Downworld's
help in locating him.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.763
In order to capture him,
so that he might escape once again?

07:47.846 --> 07:50.932
In order to execute him,
so this threat may finally end.

07:51.808 --> 07:53.059
Why should we believe you?

07:55.687 --> 07:58.857
[sighs] I understand why you
might doubt my intentions

07:58.940 --> 08:00.734
after what happened
with the SoulSword.

08:01.401 --> 08:02.986
And for that, I am sorry.

08:03.069 --> 08:04.488
But I founded this council

08:04.571 --> 08:07.699
to make things more transparent
between the Downworld and the Clave.

08:07.783 --> 08:09.200
And how has that been going?

08:09.284 --> 08:11.161
It's been a bit of
a work in progress.

08:14.873 --> 08:17.584
For far too long,
the Downworld has depended on the Clave

08:17.668 --> 08:20.629
and your Institute to protect
us from men like Valentine.

08:20.712 --> 08:23.799
It's time we learned our lesson
and started fighting for ourselves.

08:24.633 --> 08:28.679
We can't do this alone.
Valentine is a threat to all of us.

08:28.762 --> 08:32.390
The answer, Shadowhunters...
is no.

08:34.392 --> 08:35.602
Come along.

08:56.998 --> 08:58.598
I'd say,
"Let us know what you find out,"

08:58.667 --> 09:00.752
but you're not allowed to
do that anymore, are you?

09:00.836 --> 09:02.021
Look,
sorry it had to be like this.

09:02.045 --> 09:05.215
Well, as long as one side catches
them, that's all that matters, right?

09:05.298 --> 09:06.299
Right.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.927
[Clary] Luke, wait!

09:12.806 --> 09:14.265
Why are you doing this?

09:14.891 --> 09:17.494
We both know the Seelie Queen doesn't
have your best interests at heart.

09:17.518 --> 09:19.270
To be honest,
I don't think she has a heart.

09:19.896 --> 09:21.231
Look, I gotta think of my pack.

09:21.314 --> 09:22.649
Her court can protect us

09:22.733 --> 09:24.973
from anything that Valentine
and his son can throw at us.

09:25.944 --> 09:27.278
The Institute can't.

09:32.993 --> 09:34.077
No matter what,

09:35.579 --> 09:37.455
don't let either of
them leave the city.

09:37.538 --> 09:39.249
Me and my wolves
will die trying.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.251
Please don't.

09:59.519 --> 10:02.522
Shouldn't you be waking up every
vamp in the city to start hunting?

10:02.606 --> 10:06.067
[sighs] I texted Eloise to
start spreading the word.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.780
We'll search every tunnel,
sewer and darkened corner that we can.

10:10.363 --> 10:12.032
Until the sun sets.

10:12.115 --> 10:13.784
That's the best we can do.

10:15.994 --> 10:19.748
I'd be more than happy to join
them, but Magnus was kinda my ride.

10:19.831 --> 10:23.001
[chuckles] Yeah, I was surprised
he'd leave you behind like that.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.879
He's got bigger things
on his mind right now.

10:27.631 --> 10:29.257
He's been through a lot lately.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.635
We all have.

10:36.890 --> 10:39.059
[sighs] I'm truly sorry...

10:39.851 --> 10:40.936
for everything.

10:41.019 --> 10:44.564
Our worlds...
turned against each other. It's...

10:45.523 --> 10:48.026
It's not quite how I pictured
our paths would cross again.

10:49.152 --> 10:50.278
How did you picture it?

10:52.072 --> 10:53.699
I made a mistake, Isabelle.

10:54.991 --> 10:56.952
And whatever there
is between us,

10:57.535 --> 10:59.375
it's not just about
craving each other's blood.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.206
I know.

11:04.167 --> 11:05.418
I know.

11:08.171 --> 11:09.255
[clears throat] Well...

11:10.173 --> 11:13.343
if there's any good that comes out
of being at the brink of war...

11:14.886 --> 11:16.888
it's being able to stand
here in front of you.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.393
Do you really think it's
gonna come down to war?

11:24.354 --> 11:26.522
If the Downworld
stays the course...

11:27.565 --> 11:29.567
and refuses to work
with the Clave,

11:30.318 --> 11:32.487
that can be a violation
of the Accords.

11:38.659 --> 11:41.704
You may not like to hear
it, but orders are orders.

11:41.788 --> 11:45.876
Luke said to start spreading the word,
pack to pack, about Valentine and his son.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.211
It's imperative
that they be found.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.171
Look, all due respect...

11:51.464 --> 11:54.134
Luke was overwhelmingly
clear when we last spoke.

11:54.717 --> 11:58.721
I am only to listen to my alpha, all right?
So why should I listen to you?

12:00.431 --> 12:01.431
Because.

12:04.895 --> 12:05.896
That's your answer?

12:05.979 --> 12:08.523
Because she's the beta wolf.

12:09.107 --> 12:12.944
And everyone knows when the alpha's
not around, the beta's in charge.

12:13.028 --> 12:15.113
Come on,
everyone knows this, man.

12:15.196 --> 12:16.836
I mean, how long have
you been a werewolf?

12:19.117 --> 12:21.757
Don't look at me like I'm supposed
to know what he's talking about.

12:23.121 --> 12:25.402
[Simon] You turned him,
and you don't even know the rules?

12:26.707 --> 12:31.880
I think what Simon means to say is
that you should probably just go.

12:33.048 --> 12:34.549
Pretty please.

12:51.566 --> 12:52.733
[Maia] Greek alphabet, huh?

12:52.818 --> 12:55.445
Who knew dating a college
boy would come in handy?

12:56.029 --> 12:57.029
Oh, no.

12:58.364 --> 13:00.616
What? Was it the word "dating"?

13:00.700 --> 13:02.035
No, no,
it was the word "college."

13:02.118 --> 13:04.370
I mean, I haven't been
to school in forever.

13:04.454 --> 13:07.540
Classes started, like, a week ago,
and my mom already paid the meal plans.

13:07.623 --> 13:10.343
I don't even eat anymore so she's
out, like, three grand. And then...

13:11.127 --> 13:13.504
Wait. Are we dating?

13:15.298 --> 13:17.175
Would that be a bad thing?

13:18.509 --> 13:20.345
No. I... No, I just...

13:22.638 --> 13:26.059
Things like going to class and
boyfriendgirlfriend, they feel very...

13:26.142 --> 13:27.894
Mundane. Yeah.

13:27.978 --> 13:30.271
Considering how insane
everything's been.

13:31.022 --> 13:32.732
We should just stick
with, like...

13:33.608 --> 13:36.694
I like you... and you like me.

13:38.279 --> 13:40.656
But what if I likelike you?

13:42.825 --> 13:46.329
Sorry to interrupt.
Clary, hey. Long time.

13:47.163 --> 13:48.748
Hey, Maia. Um...

13:49.582 --> 13:52.085
Simon, we need to talk. Yeah.

14:06.892 --> 14:08.559
[Clary] So, you and Maia, huh?

14:08.643 --> 14:10.686
[Simon] Yeah.
I guess it kinda just, uh...

14:11.312 --> 14:12.313
happened.

14:12.855 --> 14:15.608
If it makes you happy,
then that's totally okay.

14:16.860 --> 14:17.861
Hey.

14:18.694 --> 14:19.695
I miss you.

14:21.239 --> 14:22.240
I miss you, too.

14:22.823 --> 14:25.451
But take it from someone
who knows all of your looks.

14:25.535 --> 14:27.703
This is not "just checking
in with my best friend."

14:28.329 --> 14:29.330
What's wrong?

14:29.414 --> 14:32.708
Okay, look. Given everything
that you and I have been through,

14:32.792 --> 14:37.255
I know that asking you for a favor
right now might be a little awkward.

14:37.338 --> 14:39.174
Derek Russel's seventh
birthday party.

14:39.257 --> 14:41.568
You sat in chocolate ice cream,
and you were afraid people might.

14:41.592 --> 14:44.554
Yeah, you switched pants with
me so that nobody would notice.

14:44.637 --> 14:47.491
And I was never invited to another one
of his birthday parties ever again.

14:47.515 --> 14:49.642
That's awkward. This is us.

14:49.725 --> 14:52.979
You know I always have your back, Fray.
And there's no job that's too big.

14:55.231 --> 14:57.233
I need you to talk
to the Seelie Queen.

14:57.317 --> 14:59.360
That job's too big. Hey...

14:59.986 --> 15:03.281
Luke talked to you about what happened
at the Downworld Council meeting, right?

15:04.074 --> 15:07.077
Look, if the Clave goes
to war with the Downworld,

15:07.160 --> 15:10.038
everything that we know
and love will be destroyed.

15:11.664 --> 15:12.832
And...

15:13.458 --> 15:18.046
you, Simon Lewis,
are the one person on the planet

15:18.129 --> 15:20.131
that even has a chance of
getting the Seelie Queen

15:20.215 --> 15:21.757
to change her mind
and work with us.

15:21.841 --> 15:23.468
How do you know this for sure?

15:24.302 --> 15:25.636
She asked about you.

15:26.262 --> 15:27.722
Me? Mmmhmm.

15:27.805 --> 15:29.682
Meeting for the fate
of the whole world?

15:29.765 --> 15:32.768
Yeah. [Sighing] Oh, boy.

15:33.353 --> 15:35.521
She'll at least hear you out.

15:40.610 --> 15:41.819
[sighs]

15:59.879 --> 16:01.256
[Madzie] Magnus.

16:04.467 --> 16:05.843
Sweet Pea!

16:05.926 --> 16:07.220
[grunts and laughs]

16:08.596 --> 16:10.140
It's so good to see you.

16:10.223 --> 16:14.560
So many warlocks all in one place.
Mmmhmm. [Chuckles]

16:15.478 --> 16:17.605
Don't get comfortable, kiddo.

16:19.899 --> 16:22.443
My dearest Catarina. [Chuckles]

16:23.486 --> 16:25.571
[Catarina chuckles] Hmm.

16:26.281 --> 16:29.993
Why so tense?
I just pulled a double in the ER.

16:30.076 --> 16:33.371
Mundanes. Can't seem to get
out of their own way, can they?

16:33.454 --> 16:35.498
Hmm.
You would know more than most.

16:35.581 --> 16:36.791
[both chuckle]

16:36.874 --> 16:39.252
Thank you so much for
coming, by the way. Hmm.

16:40.128 --> 16:43.339
Our kind only rallies for
birthdays and funerals.

16:43.423 --> 16:46.509
You're not in a suit and
there's nary a cake in sight,

16:46.592 --> 16:49.429
so what's the special occasion?

16:51.306 --> 16:55.143
Remember when we bottled Malta
during that godawful demon attack?

16:56.394 --> 16:58.114
What are you trying to
keep out of New York?

16:58.146 --> 17:00.065
It's not "out," it's "in."

17:00.606 --> 17:01.857
It's not "what"...

17:03.401 --> 17:04.484
but "who."

17:05.194 --> 17:07.238
Two very bad Shadowhunters
who cannot leave.

17:07.321 --> 17:08.614
Did the Clave okay this?

17:10.032 --> 17:11.659
Suffice to say,

17:11.742 --> 17:15.121
the common ground between the
Downworld and Alicante is...

17:16.330 --> 17:17.332
shifting.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.336
Then it's a good thing I
wear comfortable shoes.

17:23.588 --> 17:25.339
[indistinct chatter]

17:40.646 --> 17:41.814
The others have gathered.

17:46.611 --> 17:49.029
So what's our plan of attack
to infiltrate the Institute?

17:49.114 --> 17:53.701
Why waste our time on that when
the Mirror is actually in Idris?

17:54.410 --> 17:57.372
See, my operative in Alicante
just sent me a fire message.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.832
The true mirror is in Lake Lyn.

17:59.915 --> 18:02.835
Wait, why didn't you tell
me you had a spy in place?

18:02.918 --> 18:05.296
Compartmentalized information

18:05.963 --> 18:09.717
is the only way movements like
the Circle can be sustained.

18:12.678 --> 18:13.929
Right. Right.

18:14.639 --> 18:18.476
See, the true path to victory
is found by being in control

18:18.559 --> 18:21.104
of every aspect
of your situation.

18:24.149 --> 18:25.150
You understand?

18:28.068 --> 18:30.280
Warlock, let's be on our way.

18:40.623 --> 18:41.749
[Rufus grunting]

18:44.460 --> 18:45.670
[panting]

18:46.879 --> 18:47.922
[grunting]

18:50.800 --> 18:52.510
[groaning]

18:54.179 --> 18:55.180
[grunts]

18:55.888 --> 18:58.558
Make me a Portal.

18:59.142 --> 19:00.142
I can't.

19:00.935 --> 19:03.479
Someone must have erected
Portal wards around the city.

19:04.647 --> 19:07.107
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't bring 'em down.

19:07.192 --> 19:09.569
Fine. We'll fly to
the nearest airport,

19:09.652 --> 19:11.737
hike across the mountains
to Brocelind Forest.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.867
I've seen this type of ward
before, but they're rare.

19:18.035 --> 19:21.038
They're wired to keep Nephilim
blood from passing through.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.042
You're trapped.

19:29.630 --> 19:31.882
[grunts] [wolves howling]

19:34.344 --> 19:36.387
Hold them at bay
as long as you can.

19:37.305 --> 19:38.431
Jonathan.

19:39.056 --> 19:42.017
You and I have to keep moving.
Are you with me?

19:43.228 --> 19:44.687
Until the bitter end.

19:44.770 --> 19:46.356
[chuckles]

19:46.439 --> 19:47.440
Good.

19:47.523 --> 19:49.567
[howling continues]

19:50.485 --> 19:52.111
[snarling]

20:00.703 --> 20:03.163
I have an open invitation
with the queen herself.

20:03.248 --> 20:04.707
I just need a minute...

20:07.001 --> 20:09.044
I just need a minute
of her time and.

20:09.128 --> 20:11.130
And so you show up unannounced?

20:12.423 --> 20:14.049
[chuckles] No,
this is a game I play.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.926
With my, uh...
my neighbor and her kid.

20:16.761 --> 20:18.053
[stammers]

20:18.137 --> 20:20.407
Walking away pretending not to
know me is part of the game.

20:20.431 --> 20:22.850
The kid made it up.
We pretend there are fairies in the water

20:22.933 --> 20:24.495
and I'm the only one
that can talk to them.

20:24.519 --> 20:25.770
[laughing]

20:26.354 --> 20:27.563
Silly boy.

20:27.647 --> 20:30.483
The Fair Folk hide beyond the
water, not in it.

20:31.191 --> 20:33.110
You're a Seelie. Great.

20:33.193 --> 20:35.363
Uh, I need a minute
with your queen.

20:36.071 --> 20:37.990
Your queen stands before you.

20:39.659 --> 20:42.119
But you were a child,
and now you're...

20:43.621 --> 20:44.914
Confusing.

20:45.748 --> 20:47.708
Different outfits for
different occasions.

20:47.792 --> 20:48.793
Hmm.

20:49.835 --> 20:51.754
You're wary of me, aren't you?

20:52.338 --> 20:55.633
Is it because of the little game I played
with you and your friends in my court?

20:55.716 --> 20:58.093
No. No, not at all.
That's all water under the...

21:00.263 --> 21:02.390
Your Highness,
I'm here on business.

21:03.182 --> 21:07.186
That whole "moving out against the
Clave" thing, that could lead to war.

21:08.646 --> 21:09.980
I ask that you
please reconsider.

21:10.773 --> 21:13.067
I mean, you have to know
this won't end well,

21:13.150 --> 21:14.735
regardless of who
stops Valentine.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.364
So long as you're at my
side when the wind changes,

21:18.448 --> 21:22.117
not a single hair on that perfect
head of yours will be tousled.

21:24.119 --> 21:26.038
You don't want things to end
well, do you?

21:27.332 --> 21:28.499
You want war.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.293
I want change.

21:31.210 --> 21:33.504
And you, Daylighter.

21:34.213 --> 21:35.631
Join me in my court.

21:35.715 --> 21:39.134
Give me what I ask, and I shall grant
you whatever your heart desires.

21:40.010 --> 21:42.805
Thanks, but no
thanks, Your Highness.

21:45.015 --> 21:47.059
You've refused me twice now.

21:47.643 --> 21:50.043
No one, in my very long life,
has ever dared do such a thing.

21:50.104 --> 21:51.188
Well...

21:51.856 --> 21:55.943
considering you're trying to get vampires,
werewolves and warlocks to play nice...

21:56.736 --> 21:58.321
might wanna get used
to some rejection.

22:16.547 --> 22:17.547
[cell phone rings]

22:17.965 --> 22:20.068
[Clary] I thought you weren't
supposed to be helping us.

22:20.092 --> 22:22.387
[Luke on phone] Consider
this an anonymous tip.

22:22.470 --> 22:23.763
We ran down his Circle members,

22:23.846 --> 22:25.931
but we lost Valentine
when Jonathan grabbed him

22:26.015 --> 22:28.934
and pinballed up three fire
escapes and leapt out of sight.

22:29.018 --> 22:30.161
Yeah,
blondie moves like a demon.

22:30.185 --> 22:31.353
That's because he is one.

22:32.146 --> 22:35.650
On the plus side, he won't get very far.
Yeah. By order of the queen.

22:35.733 --> 22:37.693
Warlocks have put up
wards all around the city.

22:37.777 --> 22:40.905
No Portals or travel in or out
for anyone with Nephilim blood.

22:40.988 --> 22:44.116
A Shadowhunter crosses that
threshold, they get vaporized.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.828
So be careful.
We'll continue the hunt on our end.

22:50.748 --> 22:52.291
[siren wailing]

22:53.751 --> 22:55.545
Hey, spread the word.
[woman] Hey.

22:55.628 --> 22:58.423
Shadowhunter movement into and
out of the city stops immediately.

22:58.506 --> 22:59.339
[man] Okay. [Woman] We're on it.

22:59.424 --> 23:01.008
No more Shadowhunters die today.

23:01.634 --> 23:02.634
[Alec] Hey.

23:03.594 --> 23:05.430
Isabelle is on her
way back with Rufus.

23:05.513 --> 23:07.723
Guess who just tried
to Portal to Idris?

23:07.807 --> 23:09.660
Valentine must know that
we don't have the Mirror.

23:09.684 --> 23:12.770
And, presumably,
where the real one is.

23:12.853 --> 23:16.566
Look, let's stay focused on what
we can control, not what we can't.

23:16.649 --> 23:18.108
We will figure this out.

23:18.192 --> 23:20.486
So we're stuck inside the
city alone with that man?

23:20.570 --> 23:22.851
But I have no way...
[Jace and Alec continue indistinctly]

23:23.280 --> 23:24.323
[Clary] Who's JC?

23:28.202 --> 23:29.787
[Alec] ...Antitracking runes.

23:29.870 --> 23:31.706
I might be able to
speed things up.

23:33.916 --> 23:35.876
But I'm gonna need
Jace's help to do it.

23:41.466 --> 23:42.467
[Sebastian] A cemetery?

23:42.550 --> 23:47.346
As you may recall, Shadowhunters keep a
secret stash of weapons on holy ground.

23:47.429 --> 23:49.223
Enough to hold off
the entire Downworld?

23:50.182 --> 23:52.434
And then some, my boy.
And then some.

23:53.644 --> 23:58.733
So you wanna use your blood to
track your untrackable brother

23:58.816 --> 24:00.901
through the angelic connection
that you and I share?

24:01.861 --> 24:04.446
[stammers] Totally.
That sounds great. Doable.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.156
Yeah. I wanna try.

24:07.492 --> 24:10.119
Jonathan and I both have
Morgenstern blood in our veins.

24:10.202 --> 24:13.539
I had this flash of a rune when I
was thinking about the three of us.

24:14.123 --> 24:17.668
Maybe I can use our shared connections
to figure out where Jonathan is.

24:19.044 --> 24:22.422
Which I realize, thinking
back, is a bit farfetched,

24:22.507 --> 24:25.843
but hey, this from the girl who
can shoot sunlight out of her hand

24:25.926 --> 24:27.762
and make Portals
out of thin air.

24:28.345 --> 24:29.722
Well, sometimes.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.974
Well...

24:35.269 --> 24:36.729
Help me find a blank spot?

24:39.690 --> 24:41.316
Um, could you...

everything I have to give ♪

25:08.594 --> 25:13.098

25:53.598 --> 25:55.641
[Clary panting]

25:57.977 --> 26:01.480
[priest] So Jesus, returned
again, came to the tomb...

26:02.147 --> 26:03.440
[groans]

26:03.523 --> 26:06.193
[panting] What's wrong?

26:08.028 --> 26:09.905
I think we've been located.

26:12.742 --> 26:14.368
Despite my Antitracking rune.

26:17.037 --> 26:20.791
I won't say that I'm not impressed, but...
this certainly complicates things.

26:22.376 --> 26:23.979
How long will it take
your remaining soldiers

26:24.003 --> 26:25.713
to locate the
source of the wards?

26:25.796 --> 26:28.883
[Valentine] Time is a luxury
that we no longer have.

26:28.966 --> 26:31.761
There's an avenue of escape
which I'm hesitant to explore.

26:31.844 --> 26:35.973
I'll need you to hold the Institute at
bay while I do what needs to be done.

26:36.056 --> 26:37.057
I see.

26:37.892 --> 26:39.101
I'm a dead weight, am I?

26:39.184 --> 26:40.770
I know when I'm being played.

26:40.853 --> 26:43.689
Believe me, where I need to go,
it's too dangerous for you to follow.

26:43.773 --> 26:44.857
[scoffs]

26:45.440 --> 26:48.027
You, Jonathan Morgenstern,
are brilliant.

26:48.736 --> 26:52.322
And as cunning and vicious
as I have ever hoped for.

26:53.448 --> 26:54.533
Listen to me.

26:56.285 --> 26:57.536
I will come back for you.

26:58.913 --> 27:00.205
I promise.

27:03.458 --> 27:05.460
I will kill them all.

27:06.045 --> 27:08.130
Then let's stack the
deck in your favor.

27:10.632 --> 27:11.676
Excuse me.

27:12.677 --> 27:14.437
I couldn't help but
notice your tattoo there.

27:16.471 --> 27:17.597
Yeah?

27:17.682 --> 27:19.599
You ever thought about
getting a second one?

27:21.060 --> 27:22.394
[grunting]

27:25.147 --> 27:26.231
[man groaning]

27:27.482 --> 27:29.442
Feel the angelic power
coursing through your body?

27:30.861 --> 27:33.363
[man grunting] See,
it empowers my kind, but...

27:34.573 --> 27:36.742
it drives yours to a
certain kind of madness.

27:36.826 --> 27:38.160
[grunting]

27:41.288 --> 27:42.539
[growling]

27:42.622 --> 27:44.333
Take care of my son, will you?

27:46.168 --> 27:47.502
I'll go find some more.

27:49.046 --> 27:50.756
[priest speaking indistinctly]

27:56.804 --> 28:00.182
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you. [Crying]

28:18.868 --> 28:20.702
[Clary] Why would they
hide in a graveyard?

28:20.786 --> 28:23.288
They probably raided
an old weapons cache.

28:23.372 --> 28:25.852
[Jace] It doesn't explain what
happened to everybody else here.

28:30.545 --> 28:31.756
I don't think they left.

28:39.679 --> 28:41.098
Another demon trap.

28:41.181 --> 28:43.142
Well, let's split up.
Teams of two.

28:43.225 --> 28:44.665
I'll go with Izzy.
I'll go with Alec.

28:49.982 --> 28:50.983
Okay.

29:31.941 --> 29:35.485
Wanna talk about whatever happened
between you and Jace at the Institute?

29:37.696 --> 29:40.783
There's no point in talking about
any of that till we figure this out.

29:41.909 --> 29:44.744
Thank you for not asking
any questions about Clary.

29:44.829 --> 29:46.496
I figure you'll talk
when you're ready.

29:47.832 --> 29:50.125
I knew there was a reason
you were my parabatai.

30:07.392 --> 30:08.477
Stop.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.312
[growling]

30:16.276 --> 30:17.277
Is she hurt?

30:18.403 --> 30:20.739
No. She's Forsaken.

30:22.116 --> 30:23.325
[growling]

30:24.118 --> 30:25.119
[growling]

30:28.747 --> 30:30.165
[all grunting]

30:34.086 --> 30:35.880
[Alec grunts] Alec!

30:35.963 --> 30:37.047
Jace!

30:38.465 --> 30:42.094
Hello, brother.
Mind if I take you outside for a moment?

30:42.177 --> 30:43.303
[grunting]

30:44.304 --> 30:45.848
[growling]

30:47.892 --> 30:48.725
[growling]

30:48.808 --> 30:50.394
[all grunting]

31:10.289 --> 31:11.790
[growling]

31:16.628 --> 31:17.629
[sighs]

31:17.712 --> 31:19.089
I think that's the last of 'em.

31:21.675 --> 31:23.427
Alec, are you okay?
[sighs] I'm okay.

31:24.344 --> 31:27.681
Where's Jace? Sebastian.
We gotta find him.

31:28.473 --> 31:29.641
Guys!

31:30.392 --> 31:31.560
[all growling]

31:35.147 --> 31:37.191
Izzy, Alec and I got this.
Go get Sebastian.

31:37.274 --> 31:40.945
You've got the whip. The electrum.
We know it can hurt him. Go!

31:50.537 --> 31:52.039
[Jace groaning]

31:52.998 --> 31:54.333
[choking]

31:58.253 --> 31:59.754
[breathing heavily]

31:59.838 --> 32:02.341
You'll make an excellent
trophy to present Father with.

32:06.971 --> 32:08.931
[Jace choking and grunting]

32:15.479 --> 32:17.064
[laughing]

32:17.647 --> 32:19.816
Lack of oxygen getting to your
brain, is it?

32:19.899 --> 32:21.568
[grunting]

32:22.402 --> 32:23.903
[straining] He left you.

32:23.988 --> 32:25.614
He's probably not coming back.

32:25.697 --> 32:27.157
[grunting] [choking]

32:27.241 --> 32:29.368
My father is a man of his word.

32:29.451 --> 32:31.495
[gasping] He made you
spaghetti, too.

32:31.578 --> 32:32.955
[groaning]

32:35.207 --> 32:36.708
He'll be back for me. No.

32:36.791 --> 32:37.834
He will.

32:37.917 --> 32:40.337
He abandoned you. Again.

32:41.171 --> 32:42.631
He came back for me, though.

32:42.714 --> 32:45.509
It kinda makes me the favorite
son, doesn't it?

32:45.592 --> 32:46.760
[groans]

32:46.843 --> 32:48.887
If you are trying to
goad me into a fight...

32:50.139 --> 32:51.890
[Jace gasping and coughing]

32:53.475 --> 32:55.144
It is working!

32:55.227 --> 32:56.436
[breathing heavily]

33:00.899 --> 33:03.360
[Jace grunting and coughing]

33:06.446 --> 33:09.449
Care to find out who's the
best JC once and for all?

33:18.458 --> 33:20.252
It would be my absolute delight.

33:23.422 --> 33:25.174
[both grunting]

33:51.866 --> 33:54.619
You know, my father taught
me about a certain spot

33:55.204 --> 33:56.871
on a man's back where
you can stab him

33:56.955 --> 33:58.875
through his spine and the
heart at the same time.

34:00.584 --> 34:02.836
Would you mind awfully
if I showed you?

34:02.919 --> 34:04.921
You know, for a split second,

34:05.004 --> 34:07.591
when I found those journals,
I actually felt sorry for you.

34:08.175 --> 34:09.217
I don't need your pity.

34:09.301 --> 34:11.053
I need your life.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.762
[both grunting]

34:19.603 --> 34:20.978
[spits] [grunts]

34:28.027 --> 34:29.279
[both grunting]

34:30.364 --> 34:31.364
[Jace groaning]

34:34.909 --> 34:35.909
I wonder...

34:36.453 --> 34:38.996
have you stopped blathering
on because I just...

34:39.081 --> 34:41.500
[yells and groans]

34:41.583 --> 34:43.335
Punctured your lung?

34:43.418 --> 34:44.710
[groaning]

34:44.793 --> 34:47.672
Or maybe you've realized,
here at the end...

34:48.715 --> 34:51.467
that I have always
been better than you?

34:52.177 --> 34:53.303
[yells]

34:54.846 --> 34:56.931
[Isabelle] Stay away from
him, you son of a bitch.

34:57.014 --> 34:58.350
[grunting]

35:02.896 --> 35:05.690
Well, I suppose this won't be a fair
fight, then, will it?

35:05.774 --> 35:08.860
You didn't seem to have a problem when
you took a run at my baby brother.

35:09.778 --> 35:11.070
[grunts]

35:11.571 --> 35:14.991
I trusted you when I was at my
weakest, at my lowest.

35:15.074 --> 35:19.078
I brought you into my life,
into my family, and you betrayed me.

35:19.163 --> 35:20.163
[grunts]

35:23.458 --> 35:25.460
I saved your life.

35:28.963 --> 35:30.632
That should be worth something.

35:30.715 --> 35:33.315
That's why I'm giving you a more
honorable death than you deserve.

35:35.845 --> 35:38.807
[gasping] That spot
on a man's back...

35:39.433 --> 35:40.850
Father taught me, too.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.648
[Sebastian wheezing]

35:56.741 --> 35:58.243
[both grunting]

36:01.955 --> 36:03.248
[panting]

36:08.212 --> 36:10.046
Hail and farewell.

36:29.316 --> 36:32.110
[Jace] You know,
you don't have to heal them all at once.

36:34.946 --> 36:36.406
Valentine is still out there.

36:36.990 --> 36:38.074
[sighs]

36:38.157 --> 36:40.619
Yeah, well,
at least we got Jonathan, right?

36:42.120 --> 36:46.500
[inhales deeply] If we would've been
one second later, he would've...

36:49.127 --> 36:51.671
You would be...
[breath shuddering]

36:51.755 --> 36:53.882
People die in war, Clary.

36:56.468 --> 36:58.637
My mom and Dot and...

37:01.848 --> 37:04.309
[crying] I...
I can't lose you, too.

37:08.688 --> 37:11.358
You're not the only person
afraid of losing someone.

37:12.984 --> 37:13.985
[sighs]

37:15.570 --> 37:17.989
I am tired of being afraid.

37:39.177 --> 37:41.471
Thanks, Alec.
Yeah, I'll inform the council.

37:41.555 --> 37:43.598
And by council,
I mean the queen.

37:44.223 --> 37:45.892
Yeah. Give Maryse my best.

37:45.975 --> 37:46.976
[Simon] Luke!

37:47.060 --> 37:49.563
Oh. There you are.
We need to talk.

37:50.229 --> 37:52.389
Have you seen Maia?
No, she's supposed to meet me here.

37:52.441 --> 37:54.209
We're gonna tell the
wolves that Jonathan's dead

37:54.233 --> 37:55.610
but Valentine's still out there.

37:55.694 --> 37:57.070
Oh, no. What?

37:57.153 --> 37:58.213
I went back to the boat basin,

37:58.237 --> 38:00.397
and I found this outside of the Jade Wolf.
It's Maia's.

38:02.075 --> 38:04.661
What happened to her?
I don't know.

38:09.958 --> 38:10.959
[grunts]

38:14.045 --> 38:15.129
[groans]

38:28.643 --> 38:29.644
[grunts]

38:30.937 --> 38:32.606
[breathing heavily]

38:33.857 --> 38:35.317
Someone drugged me.

38:37.611 --> 38:38.820
[gasps]

38:43.825 --> 38:45.159
Where's the queen?

38:45.243 --> 38:47.746
[Meliorn] Her Majesty
will be along shortly,

38:47.829 --> 38:50.749
just as soon as she's dealt
with a more pressing matter.

39:06.055 --> 39:07.599
It's been a long time.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.521
Your Majesty.

39:15.064 --> 39:16.400
So good to see you once again.

39:16.483 --> 39:18.943
You've kept the Downworld
quite busy today.

39:19.528 --> 39:22.406
How pleased they'll be when I
deliver your head on a pike.

39:22.489 --> 39:25.367
I haven't asked you here to fight,
nor come here to be captured.

39:27.035 --> 39:28.828
I've come to make you a deal.

39:28.912 --> 39:30.246
[scoffs]

39:30.329 --> 39:32.999
What could you have that
I could possibly want?

39:47.431 --> 39:48.890
Walk with me, won't you?

39:49.891 --> 39:51.810
It's such a lovely night.

39:51.893 --> 39:56.064
Though not so beautiful as what
tomorrow may bring to the both of us.

39:57.231 --> 39:58.232
Hmm.
