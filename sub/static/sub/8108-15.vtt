00:05.923 --> 00:07.591
That's okay, Eileen.
I got this.

00:07.717 --> 00:08.718
You sure?

00:08.843 --> 00:09.677
Yeah, you get home.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.053
Thanks, Danny.
See you in the morning.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.722
I'll be here.

(SIGHS)

00:35.494 --> 00:36.704
Food's gone, Daryl.
We're closed.

00:36.829 --> 00:39.749
You wouldn't happen to have an extra
coat in there, would you?

00:39.874 --> 00:43.335
- You're wearing a coat.
- A winter coat, man. It's cold.

00:43.461 --> 00:44.670
Come on.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.805
Here.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.016
(SIGHS)

00:57.391 --> 01:01.604
Rangers? You expect me
to wear this in Jersey?

01:01.729 --> 01:04.857
Come on, man, where's your
sense of humor?

01:04.982 --> 01:06.233
Good night, Daryl.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.107
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:46.690 --> 01:47.983
Go away.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.778
(CONTINUES KNOCKING)

02:10.005 --> 02:11.590
That's not funny, freak.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.636
No one is laughing, Daniel.

03:01.724 --> 03:03.767
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

03:03.893 --> 03:05.561
You doing
anything Friday?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.439
I'm taking a lovely young lady
to the Philharmonic.

03:08.564 --> 03:10.524
Is that your way of saying
you're having sex with a hooker?

03:10.649 --> 03:13.694
Two. Can't create
a harmonic with just one.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.572
Well, I was hoping you might be
available for Rachel's Simchat Bat.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.908
- It's a...
- Jewish baby naming ceremony.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.620
A time-honored tradition,
dating all the way back to the 1960s.

03:23.162 --> 03:24.830
My house at 7:00.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.584
It'll just be the rabbi and a
few friends and some family.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.461
Nothing like welcoming
a baby into the world

03:30.586 --> 03:32.755
with a completely
naked display of hypocrisy.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.548
There'll be
plenty of wine

03:34.673 --> 03:37.259
and nice people
you can quietly mock.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.510
Wish I could,

03:38.636 --> 03:41.263
but I already put down
a deposit on 16 crates of Jell-O.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.556
House.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.561
It's one evening.
I'd like you to be there.

03:47.686 --> 03:52.441
Religious hokum against sponge bath.
Can I get back to you?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.579
Can I help you?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.039
Just browsing, thanks.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.751
Happy to be
underachieving again?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.711
Running the ER
is slacker heaven.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.005
Looking for anything
in particular?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.173
Not anymore.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.008
- Where's this guy?
- Why?

04:18.133 --> 04:21.637
'Cause he's my next patient. It'd be
rude of me not to introduce myself.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.431
He's a drunk priest
who hallucinated Jesus.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.392
Afraid you might have
missed something?

04:26.517 --> 04:27.935
Afraid you're wasting
everyone's time?

04:28.060 --> 04:30.437
It's obviously either
alcohol or exhaustion.

04:30.813 --> 04:33.440
So, you admit
you have no idea which?

04:34.233 --> 04:37.444
I admit that I'm too busy to care
who you're screwing with.

04:39.822 --> 04:40.948
Don't thank me.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.118
Just knowing I can be
of assistance is thanks enough.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.875
You went out of your way to pick him?
This is nothing.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.003
There are
no small cases...

04:54.128 --> 04:56.171
Any guesses where
this joke is going?

04:57.631 --> 04:58.966
Could be
psychomotor epilepsy.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.175
TAUB: Could be alcohol.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.344
Shouldn't we let the ER rule
the obvious out before...

05:02.469 --> 05:04.805
Could be atropine toxicity,
occipital lobe tumor.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.807
You know something about this case
you're not telling us?

05:06.932 --> 05:08.934
- Why would you think that?
- 'Cause you wanna screw with us.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.437
Or screw with
a hallucinating priest.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.148
Both are possible.
There's only one way to find out.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.026
Run an EEG for epilepsy,
CT his brain for tumors.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.738
And go check his
house of God for toxins.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.324
Foreteen, hold up.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.828
This department
is broken,

05:27.953 --> 05:30.873
and I'm not going to take a real case
until it's fixed.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.418
Job or relationship,
your choice.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.338
What?

05:37.463 --> 05:39.715
To put it in terms
you might better understand,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.259
if you don't split,
you must quit.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.762
The drug trial is over.
I'm out, she's out.

05:44.887 --> 05:45.721
Don't care.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.473
We're adults,
we can handle this.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.682
You just have to
give us a chance.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.727
No, you're not, no, you can't,
and, no, I don't.

05:52.102 --> 05:56.065
Mull it over. You got till the end
of this fake case to decide.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.905
I wasn't drunk.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.740
I had one or two drinks.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.867
People often underestimate
alcohol's effect on their...

06:06.992 --> 06:09.787
I was on my way to six.
I know how alcohol affects me.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.288
This wasn't the alcohol.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.500
You lived in Manhattan for three years,
then a year in Oregon,

06:14.625 --> 06:17.628
18 months in New Mexico,
less than a year in Wisconsin,

06:17.753 --> 06:20.464
and now you've been living in Trenton
for the last six months.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.840
Yeah.

06:23.592 --> 06:24.760
The more we know about you,

06:24.885 --> 06:26.387
the more likely it is
we can help you.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.389
Mmm. It's not medically
relevant, so...

06:28.514 --> 06:31.392
No way to know,
unless you went to medical school.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.977
(SIGHS)

06:36.480 --> 06:38.732
Four years ago, a teen in a youth group
at my church

06:38.857 --> 06:40.943
accused me of
inappropriate contact.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.237
I was innocent,
but the church decided to transfer me,

06:43.362 --> 06:45.697
said it would be easier
for all involved.

06:45.823 --> 06:47.699
When the parishioners
at the new church

06:47.825 --> 06:49.368
got wind
of why I'd been transferred,

06:49.493 --> 06:52.746
they were unhappy.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.374
I was sent off
again and again.

06:55.499 --> 06:58.210
And how is any of that
medically relevant?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.963
So, the kid lied?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.674
He was confused.

07:03.799 --> 07:06.510
Confused whether you
molested him or not?

07:06.635 --> 07:08.554
Okay, you wanted to know
why I moved around so much,

07:08.679 --> 07:09.513
and I told you.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.515
How about telling me
why I was hallucinating?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.892
Syphilis could explain
the hallucination.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.853
I'm not sexually active.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.689
You don't have to admit
you did anything with the kid.

07:18.814 --> 07:19.982
You weren't
always a priest.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.817
I wanted to be
since I was 12.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.319
I entered the seminary
when I was 17.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.113
Maybe it wasn't
a hallucination.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.739
Maybe it really
was Jesus.

07:27.865 --> 07:28.699
I'm not insane.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.701
KUTNER: Seeing Jesus
makes you insane?

07:30.826 --> 07:32.786
Bit of an odd attitude
coming from a priest.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.790
Well, it's just a job now.
The fairytale ended a long time ago.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.254
You're a wuss,
part wimp, part puss.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.673
I have no choice.
I'm part of the ceremony.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.134
I thought you were
already circumcised.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.720
It's one night
for a friend.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.346
What about the friend
who has two tickets

07:51.472 --> 07:52.931
to see
Brubeck at the Blue Note?

07:53.056 --> 07:54.600
I thought you had
an orgy planned.

07:54.725 --> 07:55.767
I lied.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.186
Are you lying about
the Brubeck tickets?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.855
Yes, but only to save you
from yourself.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.233
I'll be fine, and so will Cuddy,
if you don't show up.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.527
I'm surprised
she even invited you.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.489
It is oddly flattering.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.658
God, I'm so sick
of his stupid stunts.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.411
Everybody has to put up with their
boss' stupid stunts.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.331
No, they don't. There's HR,
there's Cuddy, there's other jobs.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.916
House doesn't listen to HR,

08:19.041 --> 08:21.210
Cuddy'll let him fire us
before she fires him,

08:21.335 --> 08:23.253
and I don't want
another job.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.631
Why do you cling to him?
Why do you defend him?

08:25.756 --> 08:26.882
Just because I don't
want to be unemployed

08:27.007 --> 08:28.050
doesn't mean I'm co-dependent.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.969
I'm not saying you're co-dependent,
I'm saying you're scared.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.597
(SIGHS)

08:36.683 --> 08:39.853
You know what?
You're right.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.898
So, you wanna quit?

08:43.023 --> 08:46.652
No, I wanna stop
a stupid stunt.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.571
House doesn't want either
one of us to quit. He wants this.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.450
He's got two lab rats in a maze
and thrown in one piece of cheese.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.994
(CHUCKLES)

08:58.789 --> 09:00.332
So, what do we do?

09:01.583 --> 09:02.834
Nothing.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.546
HOUSE: Cool.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.005
It's cool he's
a child molester?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.466
It's cool that a priest
doesn't believe in God.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.885
It's cool that God
did to him what he did to the kid.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.387
Allegedly.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.513
You think
he's innocent?

09:14.638 --> 09:15.931
He had honest eyes?

09:16.056 --> 09:16.890
And you think he's guilty,

09:17.015 --> 09:18.850
which explains why you're
dying to discharge him.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.561
I'm dying to discharge him
because he's not sick,

09:20.686 --> 09:22.437
- not because he's a pedophile.
- Allegedly.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.398
You actually believe
the kid got confused?

09:24.523 --> 09:27.609
If everybody lies,
that includes teenage boys.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.903
Aren't we lucky to have
such an interesting patient?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.822
Had. There's nothing
wrong with him.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.366
World's most boring case
just became a page turner,

09:34.491 --> 09:35.951
and you want to tear out
the last chapter?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.453
You want to examine his character,
go to his soup kitchen.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.331
We're done testing him
for things he doesn't have.

09:42.124 --> 09:44.751
Bad news for Foreman
and Thirteen.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.129
HOUSE: Case is over.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.755
We're not
splitting up.

09:49.715 --> 09:50.966
So, which one of you
is taking a hike?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.260
And neither of us
is quitting.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.137
Interesting.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.055
You were fine with Chase
and Cameron dating.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.765
You obviously don't
actually have an...

09:58.890 --> 10:00.058
You're fired.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.062
How long you
gonna keep this up?

10:04.187 --> 10:06.857
- We know you're not...
- Wrong. Again.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.859
In fact,
in the last few weeks,

10:08.984 --> 10:11.194
it's hard to remember
a correct call you made.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.947
If Chase had compromised his
professional judgment to help Cameron,

10:14.072 --> 10:15.741
I would have fired
his ass, too.

10:15.866 --> 10:16.992
FOREMAN:
When my mistake blew up,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.911
you did everything to keep me
from contacting the drug company.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.372
To save your license,
not your job,

10:22.497 --> 10:24.082
and definitely
not your relationship.

10:25.834 --> 10:26.960
So, badge.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.423
Fine.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.106
Why don't you see if you can find us
a real case?

10:55.614 --> 10:57.991
How can you discharge me when you have
no idea what's wrong?

10:58.116 --> 11:01.453
We know what's wrong,
and now that you've slept it off...

11:01.578 --> 11:03.288
It's not just
the hallucination.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.917
I feel nauseous, my foot feels numb,
like it's fallen asleep.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.377
You didn't mention
that before.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.920
I didn't notice it before.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.296
Are you hiding
from someone?

11:11.421 --> 11:12.881
Why are you so intent
on staying here?

11:13.006 --> 11:16.134
I don't feel well. I know there's
something wrong with me.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.928
Which foot?

11:18.053 --> 11:19.096
My um.

11:26.978 --> 11:27.896
Oh, God.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.527
What the hell is that?
What is that?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.988
Your toe just fell off.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.324
(SIGHS)

11:42.577 --> 11:45.038
Must be my lucky day.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.499
New symptom means the old symptom
was a real symptom,

11:47.624 --> 11:50.585
and I get to keep our pederast priest
after all.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.379
Where are Foreman
and Thirteen?

11:52.504 --> 11:53.422
They left.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.924
Leprosy could cause necrosis
and hallucinations.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.134
Why would they leave?

11:57.259 --> 11:59.678
Because Foreman
doesn't work here anymore,

11:59.803 --> 12:03.223
and Thirteen is mad
that I fired him.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.226
Don't worry,
she'll be back.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.437
She'll be pissed off,
she'll want to take a stand,

12:08.562 --> 12:10.230
and then Foreman
will convince her there's no reason

12:10.355 --> 12:12.149
both of them
should be out of a job.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.400
Leprosy's a bad fit.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.568
Why'd you fire Foreman?

12:14.693 --> 12:16.903
I gave him a choice,
split or quit.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.740
He chose neither.
How about ergotism?

12:19.865 --> 12:21.450
He's giving up
his career for her?

12:21.575 --> 12:23.452
He's giving up
this career for her.

12:23.577 --> 12:27.080
No, normal white blood count.
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

12:27.205 --> 12:28.039
They're good doctors.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.041
Separately,
they're great doctors.

12:30.167 --> 12:33.545
Better than you.
Together they're morons.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.297
Go check out the house
that they would have checked

12:35.422 --> 12:36.590
had this been a real case.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.800
And page Thirteen, tell her to run
the blood for CO,

12:38.925 --> 12:42.262
and get the priest in a hyperbaric
chamber before anything else falls off.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.768
So, what are we
gonna do now?

12:47.893 --> 12:51.855
I get a letter of recommendation
from Cuddy and find a new job.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.149
Oh, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

12:55.358 --> 12:59.279
House was right. Our relationship
did affect my judgment.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.117
Then I should quit. It'll be easier
for me to find another job.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.244
Not like this one.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.746
(SIGHS)

13:07.871 --> 13:09.331
We should both quit.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.916
What's that gonna
accomplish?

13:12.375 --> 13:15.337
Don't worry,
I'll be fine.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.257
We'll be fine.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.225
(PAGER BEEPING)

13:28.642 --> 13:30.018
(SIGHS)

13:31.144 --> 13:32.437
Go ahead.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.648
I'll see you tonight?

13:34.773 --> 13:35.982
I'll be home early.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.492
KUTNER: You really think
House is done with Foreman?

13:45.617 --> 13:47.536
TAUB: If you ask me,
Foreman should be done with Thirteen.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.162
He's not gonna get
a better job,

13:49.287 --> 13:52.082
which means he'll end up
resenting her for losing this one,

13:52.207 --> 13:53.416
which she'll
end up resenting.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.460
Or the hardship
will bring them closer together,

13:55.585 --> 13:58.505
she'll invite friends over
for Foreman to share.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.841
No leaks from the heater.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.218
She's not a nympho,
she's bisexual,

14:03.343 --> 14:05.136
which, by the way,
means she's accustomed to partners

14:05.262 --> 14:07.347
who don't need a map
to find the treasure.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.308
CO poisoning might have come
from these cigarettes.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.519
Not unless he was
smoking them in a bell jar.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.062
And even if you know
where the treasure is,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.398
it can still be pretty hard
to dig it up without a shovel.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.316
You can buy a shovel.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.781
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:28.451 --> 14:31.121
Let's see,
how do I keep House

14:31.246 --> 14:35.000
from ruining my precious display
of religious hypocrisy?

14:35.125 --> 14:37.335
I know,
I'll pressure him to attend,

14:37.460 --> 14:40.130
knowing that he'll never agree to
anything I actually want him to do.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.757
I didn't pressure you,
I invited you.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.427
And there's nothing hypocritical
about recognizing your heritage.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.262
So, you keeping kosher now?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.972
Wearing four-cornered garments?

14:49.097 --> 14:51.850
Slaughtering heifers
to the god Ra?

14:51.975 --> 14:54.185
Wait, is that
one of your people?

14:54.311 --> 14:56.396
Do it all, do nothing
or option C,

14:56.521 --> 14:58.481
you're a liar
and a hypocrite.

14:58.607 --> 15:02.861
House, for better or for worse,
you are a part of my life.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.364
It isn't a ploy,
it's a sincere invitation.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.283
I honestly want you to come.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.870
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.958
I'm glad.

15:20.879 --> 15:24.007
You idiot.
I was free and clear.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.384
Now he's coming,
and it's your fault.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.136
Since when have
your failed attempts

15:28.261 --> 15:30.764
at communication through lies
become my fault?

15:30.889 --> 15:34.225
Since you forgot
how to keep your mouth shut.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.978
You messed it up,
and now you're gonna fix it.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.356
And you're gonna
keep my name out of it.

15:42.817 --> 15:43.818
KUTNER: How is he?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.237
THIRTEEN: Stable.
Necrosis doesn't look to be spreading.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.740
I was talking about Foreman.
Is he really gonna leave?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.951
That's usually what people do
when they get fired.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.077
Why are you
biting my head off?

15:52.202 --> 15:53.662
I was just wondering
what he was gonna do.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.580
You're right, I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.998
It's not House's
fault, either.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.541
He gave
you guys a chance, you blew it.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.585
He didn't give us a chance,
he gave us an ultimatum.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.672
I would have thought five years here
would buy a mistake or two.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.715
Help me!

16:09.302 --> 16:10.387
Help me.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.142
I can't breathe. Feels like someone's
sitting on my chest.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.269
Looks like
a heart attack.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.188
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:22.107 --> 16:23.733
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

16:26.861 --> 16:28.530
I assume you've heard.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.283
I can't override him.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.285
I'm not asking you
to override him.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.371
I'm asking for a letter
of recommendation.

16:37.497 --> 16:42.335
Eric, the reality here is,
House should have fired you.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.379
You falsified
medical records,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.673
put this hospital's
reputation in jeopardy.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.800
You're lucky
you still have a license.

16:50.385 --> 16:54.180
I can't get a decent position at another
hospital without a recommendation.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.602
I'm sorry.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.027
Chest pain wasn't angina.
EKG ruled out heart attack.

17:07.152 --> 17:10.030
So, the good news is,
he didn't have a heart attack.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.157
The bad news is,
I apparently fired the only guy

17:12.282 --> 17:14.951
who actually knows
what a heart attack looks like.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.828
So, the man of God
who doesn't believe in God

17:16.953 --> 17:18.997
had a heart attack
that isn't a heart attack.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.833
Do I know how to pick
awesome cases or what?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.251
Could be
a clotting disorder.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.045
Three different symptoms,
three different clots?

17:25.170 --> 17:29.424
I know. How cool is that?
You two do an angio.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.472
You don't want to work, so why don't
you just go get me a lottery ticket?

17:35.597 --> 17:37.515
The sicker he gets,
the luckier I feel.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.100
KUTNER: Where are
you going?

17:39.225 --> 17:41.394
I've been wanting
to introduce myself.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.862
You really a virgin?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.115
You have to treat me,
you don't have to believe me.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.951
And before we treat you,
we have to diagnose you.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.287
Not knowing whether we can believe you
is making that difficult.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.039
Everything I've
told you is true.

18:01.164 --> 18:05.126
You lost your faith
because a teenager got confused.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.629
And my church abandoned me,
and my God forsook me,

18:07.754 --> 18:10.298
and I couldn't come up
with a reason why a god would do that.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.425
God gave the church
and the kid free will.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.844
Their exercise of that
free will hurt you.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.098
Means you're just
a victim of God's gift to mankind.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.100
Oh, yeah.
God wants life to have meaning.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.018
Life's meaningless
without free will.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.772
With free will, there's always
suffering. So God wants suffering.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.567
I got tired of that argument
before I even finished saying it.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.862
And even if I bought that,
what the hell is God doing?

18:32.987 --> 18:34.489
Just the big stuff?

18:34.614 --> 18:36.866
The acts of God, the hurricanes,
the earthquakes,

18:36.991 --> 18:39.452
the random killings
of millions of innocent people?

18:39.577 --> 18:40.995
Then we better damn pray.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.125
God, I wish you
weren't a pedophile.

18:46.376 --> 18:50.797

no pleurisy, no pneumonia.

KUTNER: No pain at all?

18:56.636 --> 19:00.515
- No, why?
- Because there should be.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.810
You feel that?

19:03.935 --> 19:04.978
No.

Regional anesthesia's

is related to the numbness.

it's neurological.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.290
It's a religious ceremony,
it's boring.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.125
Why waste a good evening
that could be much better spent

19:27.250 --> 19:30.044
in a drunken stupor,
feeling sorry for yourself?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.171
Okay-

19:31.296 --> 19:33.089
Okay? Okay, you won't go?

It's usually a bad one,
but a reason.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.557
She's being childish.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.768
See, that's an example
from the bad category. Is it resentment?

19:45.894 --> 19:48.062
The stork brought home a new baby
and you don't want to share Mommy,

19:48.188 --> 19:50.899
or you just can't stand
to see others happy?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.233
She's trying to play me.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.069
If I let her succeed,
the terrorists win.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.575
(BOTH CHATTERING)

20:02.035 --> 20:04.662
I heard there might be
an opening in the ER.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.581
Foreman's a neurologist,
that's not where he...

20:06.706 --> 20:08.750
I did an ER rotation
in Miami.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.378
If I can find another position, I figure
House will rehire Foreman.

20:12.503 --> 20:13.755
Don't quit.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.423
Cuddy wouldn't
give Foreman a recommendation.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.217
He's not gonna be able
to find a decent job.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.551
Foreman shouldn't
leave, either.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.304
You think they
should split up?

20:21.429 --> 20:23.765
Office romances
are a bad idea.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.101
We beat some
very long odds.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.729
Wow, honey,
save the gushy stuff for the wedding.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.772
House is
playing with you.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.857
If you let him get away with it,
he won't respect you anyway.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.192
Or House is helping you.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.902
He knows it probably
won't work out,

20:36.027 --> 20:39.072
and he's actually
doing you a favor.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.491
Yeah, that sounds
a lot more like House.

20:41.616 --> 20:44.702
I know they're looking for someone
at Mercy. I'll make a call.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.039
Is your boss
always like that?

20:48.164 --> 20:49.290
Usually worse.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.460
Finding a fellow atheist
always makes his day.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.129
You think it's possible
maybe God's testing your faith?

20:55.255 --> 20:56.464
No, I already failed.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.883
There'd be no point in
what he's doing to me now.

Got something. Looks like
intercostal neuralgia.

21:01.803 --> 21:02.971
BRESSON: What's that?

21:03.096 --> 21:06.140
Something's traumatizing one of the
nerves that runs along your ribs.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.017
Explains the chest pain
and numbness.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.811
Could also cause
muscle atrophy.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.729
- Does it do anything to the eyes?
- Why? What's wrong?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.523
You're seeing Jesus again?

21:13.648 --> 21:15.942
I'm seeing nothing.
My right eye went blind.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.367
TAUB: Ophthalmological

Nothing structurally
wrong with the eye.

His heart rate's down,
sensory loss is becoming more diffuse,

21:28.997 --> 21:30.748
progressive muscle weakness.
He's shutting down.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.793
It's got to be something systemic,
like autoimmune.

- CSF was clear for Guillain-Barré.
- Cancer?

21:41.509 --> 21:43.428
TAUB: Imaging studies
have been clear for tumors.

21:43.553 --> 21:44.846
Then that leaves infection.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.681
He'd be brimming
with white blood cells.

21:46.806 --> 21:50.852
Or we're at the backstage door
of a Duran Duran concert.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.314
Hundreds of screaming girls
clustered around.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.273
What does that mean?

21:55.398 --> 21:56.399
That girls like
rock bands.

21:56.524 --> 21:59.736
The presence of the fans
indicates the presence of the band.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.572
Different night.
Same band, same door.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.574
Now there's not
a girl in sight.

22:04.699 --> 22:05.533
What does that mean?

22:05.658 --> 22:06.826
Sorry, I don't speak
hair band.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.911
They weren't a hair band,
they were new romantics.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.079
The band already left?

22:10.204 --> 22:13.041
Nope. Band's still there,
still rocking out.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.462
When does the absence of the fans not
indicate the absence of the band?

22:19.547 --> 22:22.759
When it's 2009. There aren't
any Duran Duran fans.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.385
They don't make them
anymore.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.636
If there's no infection,

22:25.762 --> 22:28.222
it's because there aren't
any fans, no white cells.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.100
You think his spleen?

22:32.477 --> 22:34.479
Why do I bother with these
great metaphors

22:34.604 --> 22:35.646
if I still
have to spell it out?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.982
Yes, I think it's his spleen.
Go get a biopsy.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.818
I'll try to get
New Moon on Monday out of my head.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.490
Why are you
talking this time?

22:49.577 --> 22:52.038
If I quit,
will you rehire Foreman?

22:52.497 --> 22:53.498
Why?

22:53.623 --> 22:55.958
He can't find
another job, I can.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.461
And you're willing to make
that sacrifice for him?

22:58.586 --> 22:59.587
Yes.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.132
Does Foreman know
about this plan?

23:03.257 --> 23:04.342
Yes.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.683
Well, if he's okay with it,
who am I to say no?

23:17.730 --> 23:18.689
KUTNER: Hold still.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.113
You think it's my spleen?

23:25.238 --> 23:27.824
(SIGHS) That's what
they're testing.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.786
So, if I happen to cure you,
what happens then?

23:32.870 --> 23:35.665
You start thinking that God was working
through me,

23:35.790 --> 23:37.375
this is some
sort of miracle?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.419
Do you think
I'm an idiot?

23:39.544 --> 23:40.837
That's what I'm testing.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.215
Losing my faith
wasn't a choice I made.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.092
It happened,
it's gone, for good.

23:46.217 --> 23:49.929
But if it can magically disappear,
it can magically reappear.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.390
And that's what
you're hoping.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.809
- Your job...
- Sucks.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.896
That's my point. You could make
more money frapping decafs,

23:59.021 --> 24:01.774
and yet you're still
ministering to the meek.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.485
Why do the Lord's work
if the Lord has left the building?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.320
I've been with the church
my entire adult life.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.573
It's my only
marketable skill.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.492
I detect the stink
of leftover faith.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.996
You want to
talk hypocrisy, what about you?

24:15.121 --> 24:17.457
You act like
you don't care about anyone,

24:17.582 --> 24:20.418
but here you are,
saving lives.

24:20.543 --> 24:24.297
Solving puzzles. Saving lives
is just collateral damage.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.717
Nice try. I don't think you're looking
for somebody to prove you right,

24:27.842 --> 24:31.596
I think you're looking for somebody
to prove you wrong, to give you hope.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.100
You want to believe,
don't you?

24:39.353 --> 24:43.774
Yeah. I want to walk out and find myself
in a forest of whore trees.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.859
But I don't think
it's a good idea

24:44.984 --> 24:47.820
to tell people
to go fornicate with fruit.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.787
Hey, I was just
talking about you.

24:56.913 --> 25:00.082
Well, not you specifically,
whores and hypocrisy.

25:00.333 --> 25:04.378
(SIGHS) You were right.
I don't want you there.

25:04.504 --> 25:08.424
It's a special occasion,
filled with love and acceptance,

25:08.549 --> 25:09.717
and the last thing I need
is someone there

25:09.842 --> 25:12.386
who's filled
with loathing and contempt.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.473
Okay-

25:17.391 --> 25:18.601
That's it?

25:20.102 --> 25:22.063
You're really
not coming?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.523
I'm really not coming.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.318
Thank you.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.861
You're welcome.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.697
Gosh, I feel so grown-up.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.952
He's obviously just
jerking you around.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.662
Wants to see
if you're serious.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.830
If you just stick it out,
I think he'll bring Foreman back.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.666
I don't.
And even if I'm wrong,

25:41.791 --> 25:43.793
I think you should
still split up.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.045
It's just a matter of time
before one of you finds

25:46.170 --> 25:47.755
the other in bed
with another woman.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.757
This coming from
the relationship expert.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.008
12 years and counting.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.511
Hey, if you can
make it that long, then anyone can.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.221
Funny how
the two people in the room

25:55.346 --> 25:56.973
who think
relationships are easy

25:57.098 --> 25:58.224
are both single.

25:58.349 --> 25:59.392
I don't think
they're easy.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.351
That's why I think

26:00.476 --> 26:01.978
if you find something
that could be good,

26:02.103 --> 26:02.979
you should
hang on to it.

26:03.104 --> 26:05.856
Everything could be good,
very little ever is.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.818
His spleen is fine. Just some
insignificant traces of minor bugs.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.570
Nothing that'd
make him sick.

26:10.695 --> 26:11.862
Which minor bugs?

26:15.616 --> 26:18.119
Why do people suddenly find religion
when they have kids?

26:18.244 --> 26:19.704
Fear of the unknown.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.998
Cornerstone of faith.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.750
I think it makes
perfect sense.

26:24.875 --> 26:28.254
So it makes sense
because it doesn't make sense?

26:28.379 --> 26:31.549
The fact that you're railing about it
doesn't make a lot of sense.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.802
You really got a thing
for your boss, huh?

26:34.927 --> 26:38.097
I've got a thing
for my boss's thing.

26:38.222 --> 26:42.393
She doesn't have a thing per so.
I'm big on metaphors.

26:43.978 --> 26:47.857
What about you?
Twenty-nine years of celibacy.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.150
What's holding
you back now?

26:49.525 --> 26:51.444
Who wants a relationship
with a priest?

26:51.569 --> 26:52.903
Who wants
a relationship?

26:57.283 --> 26:58.868
House.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.623
It's the holy water.

27:03.748 --> 27:06.876
We assumed if it was an infection, it
had to be something big and nasty.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.878
But he has pneumocystis,

27:09.003 --> 27:11.797
a harmless bug that's everywhere
and never makes anyone sick,

27:11.922 --> 27:14.091
unless they have
a compromised immune system.

27:23.351 --> 27:26.812
So Father Nietzsche has AIDS.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.234
Impossible.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.986
I've never had
a blood transfusion,

27:34.111 --> 27:36.572
I've never done IV drugs,
I've never had sex.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.157
So prove it.
Have an AIDS test.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.951
No. I know
I don't have AIDS.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.162
We can't treat you
until we know what it is.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.622
A negative result
proves nothing.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.666
On the off chance
it's a false positive,

27:46.791 --> 27:49.001
I permanently lose any
credibility I have left.

27:49.126 --> 27:50.294
I'd say
you just lost that.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.463
I'd say I lost that with you
a long time ago.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.052
TAUB: We should start
treatment for AIDS.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.011
KUTNER: We need to be sure.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.806
The antiretrovirals could fry his heart,
his liver, his kidneys...

28:01.931 --> 28:03.557
- I'm willing to take that chance.
- Big of you.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.476
I'm more worried about
the kid he molested.

28:05.601 --> 28:06.811
We should be finding him
and getting him tested.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.020
You don't think
he already got tested?

28:08.145 --> 28:09.772
Maybe he did,
maybe he didn't,

28:09.897 --> 28:11.565
but that's a chance
I'm not willing to take.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.193
Legally, we can't inform
sexual partners about STDs.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.987
This isn't some middle-aged barfly
who likes it bareback,

28:17.113 --> 28:18.698
this is an innocent kid
who was molested.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.367
You just want to rub the priest's face
in it. Get him transferred again.

28:21.492 --> 28:24.620
Yeah, heaven forbid
a diddler has job issues.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.665
And you get brought up
on charges.

28:27.790 --> 28:31.127
Lost enough doctors this week.
Treat him for AIDS.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.214
Found a job.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.175
I didn't know
you were looking.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.761
Eggers at Mercy says
I can start Monday.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.723
- Why would you...
- House says if I go, you can come back.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.474
(CHUCKLES) It's been
less than two days.

28:45.599 --> 28:48.310
You give up on me that fast?
You get a job behind my back?

28:48.436 --> 28:49.687
You're acting like
I'm cheating on you.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.772
I said I would handle this.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.025
House knew
you'd be like this.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.153
(SCOFFS)

28:57.278 --> 28:58.404
Wow.

28:59.321 --> 29:02.032
Guess House knows me
better than you do.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.909
Too bad I don't go
both ways.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.287
Good night.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.712
Don't you hate when they put
the mushrooms underneath the cheese?

29:14.837 --> 29:18.174
Your attendance
is validating her hypocrisy.

29:18.299 --> 29:22.386
If she invited you to a ceremonial
lynching, would you go?

29:22.511 --> 29:26.223
It would depend on what she was serving.
Everyone's a hypocrite.

29:26.348 --> 29:29.769
Why are you suddenly so obsessed with
Cuddy's particular brand?

29:29.894 --> 29:31.812
I'm just making
conversation.

29:31.937 --> 29:32.938
Would you rather we go back
to talking

29:33.063 --> 29:34.774
about mushrooms
and cheese?

29:35.608 --> 29:37.526
You're the hypocrite.
You want to go.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.780
You don't resent this baby,
you want to be a part of it.

29:40.905 --> 29:44.033
Yes, but not until
her 16th birthday in some states.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.701
This is ridiculous.
You two deserve each other.

29:45.826 --> 29:49.455
If you want to go,
just go and act like a human being.

29:49.580 --> 29:53.250
Wow. Solid advice.
Except for two things.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.212
I'm acting like I don't want to go
because I don't want to go,

29:56.337 --> 30:01.884
and I am incapable
of acting like a human being.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.524
Ryan?

30:18.108 --> 30:21.570
- Yeah.
- I'm Dr. Chris Taub. Can we talk?

30:22.071 --> 30:24.156
Yeah. What's wrong?

30:25.491 --> 30:27.076
In private?

30:27.201 --> 30:28.744
Nobody's listening
to us here.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.873
I work at
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.209
I have some news
about Father Daniel Bresson.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.504
What about him?

30:40.756 --> 30:42.800
We believe he has AIDS.

30:44.093 --> 30:45.553
Okay, so?

30:46.428 --> 30:50.474
Well, given the incident
four years ago,

30:50.599 --> 30:53.602
I think you should be tested,
unless you've already done so.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.317
How sick is he?

31:00.442 --> 31:01.610
Very.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.114
Okay. Well, thanks.

31:06.323 --> 31:09.076
Have you been tested?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.536
Yeah.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.913
And?

31:13.789 --> 31:16.500
And it really isn't
any of your business.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.598
I want my job back.

31:32.850 --> 31:37.396
Love, sacrifice,
deception and now betrayal.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.732
This is better
than a telenovela.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.275
What's going on?

31:41.400 --> 31:44.653
Well, either Foreman is here
as the two of you discussed,

31:44.778 --> 31:47.364
to beg for his job back in
exchange for me dumping you

31:47.573 --> 31:49.658
or nothing.

31:52.536 --> 31:53.579
You're trying
to get me fired?

31:53.704 --> 31:55.873
I'm suggesting you quit
and I stay,

31:56.081 --> 31:58.083
which is exactly what
you suggested last night.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.752
I told Eggers
I didn't want the job.

31:59.877 --> 32:03.464
Find another one. it took you
eight hours to find that one.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.383
The point is, why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

32:06.508 --> 32:07.718
Why are you here
without me?

32:07.843 --> 32:09.678
You're overreacting.
We'll talk about this later.

32:09.803 --> 32:11.764
That's what this is about.
It's about you taking control.

32:11.889 --> 32:14.308
It's about you not being
able to handle me saving your ass.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.185
And you're not being
controlling right now?

32:16.310 --> 32:19.021
Yeah, who's the
controlling bitch now?

32:19.146 --> 32:20.773
House, shut up.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.817
You never wanted
to take that other job.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.611
You never wanted
to save me.

32:25.736 --> 32:28.530
You wanted to offer to save me,
so you wouldn't feel guilty.

32:28.656 --> 32:31.784
You knew I'd say no.
That's why you're so mad right now.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.039
You're an idiot.

32:43.504 --> 32:46.882
Well, either you can go after her
and try and patch things up,

32:47.925 --> 32:51.011
or you blow her off
and take your old job back.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.392
(SIGHS)

33:03.857 --> 33:05.275
Welcome back.

33:10.447 --> 33:11.824
The AIDS meds
aren't gonna work.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.493
If you'd let us do a test,
we could stop treating you,

33:14.618 --> 33:16.161
or you could stop lying.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.372
(GROANS)

33:18.497 --> 33:19.748
I know the feeling.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.835
BP's climbing.
You feeling okay?

33:22.960 --> 33:24.795
No. I feel flushed.

33:24.920 --> 33:29.049
I'm burning all over.
My chest...

33:34.680 --> 33:35.806
TAUB: It's not a new symptom,

33:35.931 --> 33:37.433
it's just a reaction
to the AIDS meds.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.852
Yeah, he reacted by getting worse.
Means it's not AIDS.

33:39.977 --> 33:41.270
"So went Satan forth

33:41.395 --> 33:45.315
from the presence of the Lord
and smote Job sore with boils."

33:45.441 --> 33:47.693
You think
it's Hyper lgE Syndrome?

33:47.818 --> 33:50.529
I prefer the colloquial term,
Job's Syndrome.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.990
Explains the symptoms,
and my quote.

33:53.115 --> 33:55.117
It's the first thing I checked.
lgE levels are normal.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.660
It could be some
other genetic disorder.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.788
Cerebral microtumors could explain
the blindness and the hallucinations.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.790
We didn't find
any tumors.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.917
That's why I didn't say tumors,
I said microtumors.

34:04.043 --> 34:07.921
So your explanation doesn't depend on us
being major morons, just morons?

34:09.381 --> 34:11.175
- We should start genetic testing.
- Takes too long.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.177
- So we start treatment.
- Treatment is surgery.

34:13.302 --> 34:14.928
We can't open him up
without confirmation.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.181
So your position is we can't test
and we can't treat?

34:17.306 --> 34:19.266
My position is
you're wrong.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.934
This isn't going to work.

34:21.060 --> 34:24.188
Are you kidding?
I've never felt more alive.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.107
Conflict breeds creativity.
Go run the genetic test.

34:27.232 --> 34:28.317
On it.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.367
So, now you don't think
I have AIDS?

34:37.493 --> 34:38.952
I still think it's AIDS.

34:39.078 --> 34:42.539
On the off chance it isn't,
we're pursuing other avenues.

34:47.461 --> 34:48.670
Ryan.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.510
He's...
He's dying?

34:54.635 --> 34:56.386
We don't know
what's wrong with him.

34:56.512 --> 34:59.264
- Can I speak to him?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

34:59.389 --> 35:00.432
Ryan?

35:03.936 --> 35:07.731
Why don't I get you a...
Come on, Ryan. Now's not a good time.

35:17.199 --> 35:18.367
I'm sorry.

35:24.414 --> 35:25.624
For everything.

35:33.549 --> 35:35.050
I'm sorry.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.360
I know.

35:55.612 --> 35:56.780
I know.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.337
(SIGHS)

36:12.462 --> 36:14.131
(DOOR OPENING)

36:17.176 --> 36:19.052
Any second thoughts
about Cuddy?

36:19.178 --> 36:23.265
No, but please feel
free to blather on.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.392
Raising a child
on her own is scary.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.562
She's just doing what
you do, what everyone does.

36:28.687 --> 36:29.938
Trying to avoid pain.

36:30.063 --> 36:31.899
Religion is not the opiate
of the masses,

36:32.024 --> 36:34.651
religion is the placebo
of the masses.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.236
If you're saying that
she's not a hypocrite...

36:36.361 --> 36:39.907
I'm not.
I'm trying to give you a rational reason

36:40.032 --> 36:44.494
to overlook her hypocrisy, so you don't
feel like a hypocrite for going.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.705
Oh. Sorry, continue.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.123
Okay-

36:48.540 --> 36:52.502
Even if an absolute truth exists,
we can't know all of it.

36:52.628 --> 36:55.714
And you can't condemn her
for recognizing that.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.069
Are you eliminating
symptoms?

37:17.194 --> 37:18.904
We can know everything.

37:19.196 --> 37:21.448
This is medicine,
not metaphysics.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.158
Truth is truth.

37:28.622 --> 37:29.456
It fits.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.083
It doesn't fit.

37:31.208 --> 37:33.210
You can't eliminate
a symptom.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.128
I can if it's not
a symptom.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.922
Well, what is it?

37:37.047 --> 37:38.215
Not a symptom.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.309
You're not going to die.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.439
You have
Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.692
It impairs
your immune system,

37:56.817 --> 38:00.654
makes you susceptible to all the AIDS
stuff without actually having AIDS.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.532
And you didn't catch it,
you were born with it.

38:03.657 --> 38:05.325
Another gift from God.

38:07.869 --> 38:08.704
You sure?

38:08.829 --> 38:10.455
Genetic tests
should confirm it,

38:10.580 --> 38:14.334
but it explains all your symptoms.
Toe, chest, eyes, skin.

38:14.668 --> 38:17.170
What about
my hallucination?

38:17.296 --> 38:19.172
Scotch explains that.

38:22.843 --> 38:24.553
That was just
a coincidence?

38:26.763 --> 38:29.057
Coincidences do happen.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.814
But that coincidence is what brought me
to you in the first place.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.236
You promised
you wouldn't go there.

38:43.655 --> 38:48.160
Einstein said, "Coincidences are God's
way of remaining anonymous."

38:49.328 --> 38:54.082
A woman in Florida said, "Look, Jesus
is on my cheese sandwich."

38:54.207 --> 38:57.669
You didn't even want to take my case.
You didn't even think I was sick.

38:59.296 --> 39:02.299
The fact that I was wrong
is not a proof of God.

39:07.137 --> 39:08.513
I'm just trying to understand

39:08.638 --> 39:12.100
how my life can completely turn around
in a single day.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.315
Don't worry, your life will go back
to sucking soon enough.

39:21.109 --> 39:24.321
Everything that happened to you
can be rationally explained.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.158
I know. It's just...

39:33.789 --> 39:35.624
That's a lot
of coincidences.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.726
House was right
about the priest.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.188
Genetic test confirmed
it was Wiskott-Aldrich.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.606
And I would've
discharged him.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.191
Everybody would've
discharged him.

40:01.316 --> 40:05.320
House included.
He only took that case as a stall.

40:06.196 --> 40:09.074
And yet it was a real case,
and he solved it.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.701
By violating
his own principles,

40:11.827 --> 40:14.287
and ignoring
the admitting symptoms.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.206
Still, he somehow
got away with it.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.835
Saved another life.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.255
You want him
there tonight.

40:29.136 --> 40:30.262
You should tell him.

40:39.563 --> 40:41.273
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:50.198 --> 40:51.283
Cold out there.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.785
At least you have shoes
that cover your toes.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.331
So, it's tonight?

40:58.457 --> 40:59.624
Yeah.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.377
Bad weather for it, huh?

41:02.502 --> 41:03.628
Maybe you'll get lucky.

41:03.753 --> 41:07.382
Maybe your sister will decide the roads
are too dangerous to drive on.

41:07.507 --> 41:08.633
(CHUCKLES)

41:08.758 --> 41:10.051
Fingers crossed.

41:16.725 --> 41:18.018
Have fun.
