00:10.260 --> 00:13.752
- Walter, what are you doing?
- I'm dosing a caterpillar.

00:13.930 --> 00:18.333
- Dosing. As in LSD?
- Well, it's a special blend.

00:18.535 --> 00:22.767
- I see. Hey, guess what just happened?
- Hmm?

00:22.939 --> 00:26.272
My father giving drugs to bugs
became a typical moment in my life.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.070
It's wonderful, isn't it?

00:28.244 --> 00:30.109
Have you heard from Olivia
this morning?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.771
- No. Why, what's up?
- She's missing.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

01:13.389 --> 01:14.515
Who are you?

01:21.331 --> 01:23.299
What do you want?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.242
This won't take long.

01:35.745 --> 01:37.679
I'm sure you say that to all the girls.

01:41.618 --> 01:43.586
- Turn her over.
- Aah!

01:43.753 --> 01:46.085
Listen up.
One of our own has been abducted.

01:46.256 --> 01:49.089
The vehicle of Agent Olivia Dunham
was found abandoned...

01:49.259 --> 01:52.751
...on Graniteville Road in Westford
three miles northeast of Little Hill.

01:52.929 --> 01:55.557
I want everyone doing everything.
Cameras checked.

01:55.732 --> 01:58.895
Officers and agents questioned.
Anyone who might've seen anything.

01:59.068 --> 02:01.935
P.D., D.W.P, AAA,
I don't care what acronym it is.

02:02.138 --> 02:04.163
Get them, talk to them
and find Dunham.

02:04.340 --> 02:07.935
For those of you new to this office,
this is Francis, my second in command.

02:08.144 --> 02:10.134
You got anything,
you come to me or him.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.235
Try not to move.

02:39.209 --> 02:40.301
Hah!

02:48.918 --> 02:52.410
- Sir, did it work?
- I hope so. Get my car ready.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.422
- I'm going back to the office.
- Yes, sir.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.691
Can I please have some water?

03:08.438 --> 03:11.430
If you're going to kill me,
then can I please have some water?

03:13.643 --> 03:14.803
Please?

03:25.788 --> 03:27.312
I need to... I need to sit up.

03:29.259 --> 03:30.920
Please.

03:34.831 --> 03:36.958
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

03:41.671 --> 03:43.832
Thank you.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.389
Pull agents from Albany
and get them to Boston.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.721
Do I need to remind you
how I started this?

04:06.896 --> 04:11.629
- I have a Sanford Harris, line six.
- Just get it done.

04:13.002 --> 04:16.961
Sanford? Listen, we are...
We're having something of a crisis here.

04:17.140 --> 04:19.130
Yeah, your crisis is why I'm calling.

04:19.309 --> 04:21.004
Look, Phillip, we go back too far.

04:21.177 --> 04:25.011
I say something diplomatic, you'll see
through it before the end of my sentence.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.878
- You're calling about Olivia Dunham?
- I'm calling about Fringe Division.

04:29.052 --> 04:31.816
Internal Affairs is sending me in
to review your office.

04:31.988 --> 04:34.047
Make sure things
are running as they should.

04:34.724 --> 04:36.885
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.590
Hey!

05:45.762 --> 05:48.094
This is Agent Dunham.
I need to speak to Broyles.

05:49.866 --> 05:51.800
- What happened to you?
- I'm in Watertown.

05:51.968 --> 05:54.630
There's a building we need to raid.
I need agents, maybe 20.

05:54.804 --> 05:57.238
Have them meet me in 30 minutes
at Talcott Street.

05:57.407 --> 05:59.898
- Are you okay?
- Not yet I'm not.

06:59.202 --> 07:01.067
The building I was being held at...

07:01.237 --> 07:04.138
Hands behind your head
and drop to the floor.

07:04.307 --> 07:06.070
- Where's Broyles?
- Do it!

07:07.376 --> 07:08.638
What's going on here?

07:08.811 --> 07:10.005
Freeze, right there!

07:46.282 --> 07:48.512
Quite a day, Agent Dunham.

07:51.954 --> 07:53.785
You're in Boston Hospital.

07:56.425 --> 07:59.394
You probably didn't think
you'd see me again so soon.

08:02.098 --> 08:05.727
Don't take this the wrong way,
Mr. Harris, but...

08:06.402 --> 08:08.427
...I don't think about you
all too often.

08:08.604 --> 08:10.094
Really?

08:12.542 --> 08:18.503
Well, you must get some satisfaction
from what you did to me.

08:19.215 --> 08:22.378
My conviction
wasn't a point of pride for you?

08:23.886 --> 08:25.751
Why am I cuffed to the bed?

08:25.922 --> 08:31.019
Because this is the kind of authority
that I have here.

08:31.594 --> 08:37.328
You see,
my conviction on sexual assault...

08:37.832 --> 08:41.826
...that you so ably prosecuted,
was overturned.

08:42.837 --> 08:45.602
And Homeland Security,
for whom I consult...

08:45.775 --> 08:50.109
...has assigned me
to review Fringe Division.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.837
Just like that.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.652
Which gives me the prerogative
to question your sanity...

08:58.821 --> 09:01.949
...your loyalty,
your worthiness to serve.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.685
And it seems to me
the people you surround yourself with...

09:05.861 --> 09:09.160
...have failed those tests
at every turn.

09:11.367 --> 09:14.427
Beginning with your former partner...

09:14.604 --> 09:16.265
...uh, heh...

09:16.439 --> 09:18.168
...and lover.

09:20.276 --> 09:21.766
John Scott.

09:26.182 --> 09:28.150
John!

09:28.651 --> 09:31.779
An agent who betrayed you.

09:32.088 --> 09:35.148
A guy who turned out to be a traitor
against this country.

09:35.324 --> 09:39.226
A traitor whose life you went to
considerable lengths to save.

09:39.395 --> 09:40.987
If you're suggesting I knew...

09:41.163 --> 09:46.795
You went to Iraq to recruit a man
to help you save Agent Scott's life.

09:47.370 --> 09:52.569
- Peter Bishop. Arrested seven times.
- I needed Peter.

09:52.742 --> 09:56.473
To assist you in freeing his father
from a mental institution.

09:58.347 --> 10:01.077
Walter Bishop.
He was sent to St. Claire's...

10:01.250 --> 10:05.209
...because he was deemed unfit
to stand trial for manslaughter.

10:05.388 --> 10:07.549
A man who spent
most of his adult years...

10:07.723 --> 10:12.717
...running questionable scientific
experiments on human subjects.

10:12.895 --> 10:16.490
He's out of his mind, Ms. Dunham.

10:16.666 --> 10:20.602
These are the people
you surround yourself with.

10:20.770 --> 10:23.830
A traitor, a criminal, and a lunatic.

10:25.341 --> 10:27.070
What does that say about you?

10:29.545 --> 10:31.740
Am I under arrest?

10:35.685 --> 10:37.050
Hmm.

10:42.191 --> 10:46.787
It goes without saying that you are not
to investigate your own abduction.

10:46.962 --> 10:48.691
Understood?

11:13.489 --> 11:15.081
Liv.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.061
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.724
Liv, you know I had nothing to do
with the way you were taken in, right?

11:27.903 --> 11:29.666
Yeah. I know that.

11:29.839 --> 11:33.741
Harris molested three women, I put
him away. That's what this is about.

11:33.909 --> 11:37.675
I'm not gonna ask him for a thing.
I'm gonna go to that building myself.

11:37.847 --> 11:41.715
Yeah, we sent a team to the address,
the building where you were being held.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.617
It was empty.

11:47.156 --> 11:48.646
There was nothing there.

11:48.824 --> 11:51.691
What about the phone I got?
The car I took?

11:51.861 --> 11:56.298
They're clean.
The only prints were yours.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.038
Oh, there's something else.

12:04.607 --> 12:08.771
There's a woman here to see you.
Rachel. Says that you're expecting her.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.275
Who is she?

12:15.551 --> 12:17.178
She's my sister.

12:18.521 --> 12:21.285
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:21.690 --> 12:23.282
- You look great.
- I don't really.

12:23.459 --> 12:24.824
- Come on, you do.
- I don't.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.452
- You're always so hard on yourself.
- I know. Whatever. Thank you.

12:28.631 --> 12:31.623
- You are just a giant person.
- Hi, Aunt Olivia.

12:31.801 --> 12:35.237
Hello. When did you get so big?

12:35.404 --> 12:39.306
- What happened to your face?
- Oh, it's...

12:40.309 --> 12:41.401
I brought this for you.

12:41.577 --> 12:43.909
She wanted to bring you something
from her room.

12:46.215 --> 12:50.015
I really, really needed one of these.
Thank you so much.

12:52.488 --> 12:55.582
- Are you sure you're all right?
- It's a long story. I...

12:55.791 --> 12:58.487
- I'm working on a case, so...
- Go, go. We're good.

12:58.661 --> 13:01.562
Is it okay if we still stay
with you tonight? If it's not...

13:01.730 --> 13:04.392
No, of course.
I'll meet you back here at 5.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.263
- Perfect. Go. Save the world. I love you.
- All right.

13:07.436 --> 13:09.427
- I'll see you at 5.
- Thank you so much.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.163
Bye.

13:17.446 --> 13:19.175
- Hello?
- Peter, it's me.

13:19.348 --> 13:23.284
Olivia. Thank God. Are you okay?
How are you? Where are you?

13:23.452 --> 13:25.943
I'm on my way to you.
Meet me outside in 10 minutes.

13:26.121 --> 13:27.679
Bring your father, we need him.

13:31.026 --> 13:32.789
Do I have to?

13:41.971 --> 13:44.804
They... They gave me a spinal tap.

13:44.974 --> 13:47.943
They put electrodes
with sensors on my head.

13:48.477 --> 13:50.638
Why would they do that?
What would they want?

13:50.846 --> 13:53.110
What were they doing?
Who could they be?

13:53.282 --> 13:56.080
You're like a question machine.

13:56.452 --> 13:59.216
- There was nothing when they checked?
- No.

13:59.388 --> 14:02.380
They cleared the building,
but I took something before I left.

14:02.558 --> 14:05.891
Something from one of their labs,
and I hid it to keep it safe.

14:06.061 --> 14:07.119
What was it?

14:35.758 --> 14:37.385
Can you identify what it is?

14:39.194 --> 14:42.095
Yes, I'm afraid I can.

14:42.898 --> 14:46.356
If your high school bio teacher told
you that humans sit at the top...

14:46.535 --> 14:49.504
...of the food chain,
he or she was dead wrong.

14:50.940 --> 14:55.377
Literally millions and millions
of organisms feed on us...

14:55.544 --> 14:58.445
...reproduce within us.

15:04.286 --> 15:09.485
Viruses, bacteria,
protozoa and fungi:

15:09.658 --> 15:12.821
The four musketeers
of the pathogenic world.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.201
Dr. Kinberg?

15:24.373 --> 15:25.567
Dr. Kinberg?

15:26.308 --> 15:28.367
Somebody call an ambulance!

15:28.544 --> 15:29.841
Somebody help him!

15:33.048 --> 15:35.710
Call 911! Get a doctor right away!

15:43.926 --> 15:44.950
Somebody help him.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.385
Gah!

16:45.054 --> 16:46.954
Dunham,
I know you've had quite a day...

16:47.122 --> 16:49.488
...but there's been an event
that requires our attention.

16:49.658 --> 16:50.989
Okay. Where?

16:56.398 --> 17:00.334
Internal hemorrhaging,
rapid cell deterioration.

17:00.903 --> 17:03.133
It appears that he suffocated
from within.

17:03.305 --> 17:06.502
Maybe that's because a slimy,
spiky slug came out of his mouth.

17:06.675 --> 17:08.233
Yes.

17:08.410 --> 17:10.901
And I have a theory
as to what it might have been.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.207
I'm sure you do. Care to share?

17:13.781 --> 17:15.477
- Eventually.
- Peter, anything?

17:15.651 --> 17:18.814
No. It always takes a second
for the thermal cameras to calibrate.

17:18.987 --> 17:21.717
- What do we know about our guy?
- What I was told outside.

17:21.890 --> 17:26.691
His name's Miles Kinberg. Immunologist.
Cutting-edge work. An expert in his field.

17:26.862 --> 17:28.159
That's all I know.

17:28.329 --> 17:32.528
Well, whatever it was, it ripped
through his esophagus on the way out.

17:32.701 --> 17:36.102
At least he died teaching.
A righteous profession.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.363
Hold on a second.

17:39.041 --> 17:41.601
- I got it.
- Stay there.

17:45.380 --> 17:48.577
- Right there. Right there, right there!
- Look.

17:48.751 --> 17:50.912
- Simian hemorrhagic fever.
- Under the chair.

17:51.086 --> 17:55.352
The infected cells
have a definitive spiderweb look.

17:55.524 --> 17:58.721
Makes HIV look like a common cold
by comparison.

17:58.894 --> 18:02.887
- Walter.
- Ebola. First, the headaches.

18:03.065 --> 18:07.263
- Then the skin turns to rice pudding.
- Walter, please.

18:07.436 --> 18:10.837
No time for the immune response.

18:14.109 --> 18:15.736
I lost it.

18:16.278 --> 18:19.475
- What do you mean you lost it?
- Either it can vanish, or it's fast.

18:20.949 --> 18:23.884
- It's really fast. There.
- Cover the doors.

18:24.052 --> 18:26.111
It's going down. There.

18:27.122 --> 18:28.282
- Get it!
- There! There!

18:28.457 --> 18:31.085
Get it. Get it, get it, get it.

18:33.061 --> 18:36.155
Things like this used to happen
in the lab all the time.

18:38.467 --> 18:39.900
Makes me nostalgic.

18:48.443 --> 18:49.933
Spirited, isn't it?

18:50.112 --> 18:53.081
Well, have you considered,
I don't know, killing it?

18:53.248 --> 18:58.515
We can always kill it, son.
We can't always bring it back.

18:58.687 --> 19:01.383
- You probably could.
- That is true.

19:04.193 --> 19:06.957
- Do you know what I could go for?
- Don't say food.

19:07.129 --> 19:08.687
- Cheese steak.
- Ugh.

19:08.897 --> 19:13.664
- How can he even think about eating?
- I know. It's disgusting, right? And yet...

19:14.002 --> 19:17.028
- Heh. You want one too.
- Extra provolone, please.

19:17.206 --> 19:21.472
- Like father, like son.
- Come on, don't say that.

19:24.012 --> 19:27.140
My theory is correct. I knew it.

19:27.316 --> 19:30.046
This organism was developed
from the same material...

19:30.219 --> 19:32.050
...that Olivia stole from her captors.

19:33.155 --> 19:35.146
- We must let her know.
- You're sure?

19:35.324 --> 19:37.815
My boy, I'm not even sure
that we all exist...

19:37.993 --> 19:41.827
...on the same plane of consciousness.
But yes, I believe so.

19:47.202 --> 19:51.229
I've been briefed
on how you brought in Olivia Dunham.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.237
I suspected she might be dangerous.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.536
I agreed to let you question her,
not tranq her like a rabid dog.

19:56.712 --> 19:58.202
What you did was unacceptable.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.838
Dunham's been nothing but an
exemplary agent and this is my office.

20:02.050 --> 20:04.644
Well, then, you need to be corrected
on two counts.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.082
The jury's out on Dunham.

20:06.255 --> 20:09.224
I'm not convinced
she's the superstar you claim she is.

20:09.391 --> 20:11.086
How could you be?
You're on a vendetta.

20:11.260 --> 20:12.352
Secondly...

20:12.527 --> 20:15.758
...while I'm here on active investigation,
this is under my purview.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.331
Active investigation?
This morning it was a review.

20:19.501 --> 20:22.231
Well, the Pentagon is concerned,
Phillip.

20:22.404 --> 20:25.032
Well, think of how this office
was thrown together.

20:25.207 --> 20:28.574
Flight 627 lands, and suddenly
you're in charge of two dozen agents?

20:28.744 --> 20:31.372
Somehow, I think none of that's
the reason you're here.

20:32.848 --> 20:34.679
This isn't a witch hunt.

20:35.617 --> 20:39.383
I'm not here to punish some JV agent
who tried to ruin my life...

20:39.554 --> 20:41.351
...for chasing a little tail.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.185
I'm here to do my job.

20:44.893 --> 20:46.121
Why don't you do the same?

20:50.332 --> 20:53.130
Did you see anyone unusual
in class?

20:53.302 --> 20:55.702
- No.
- And did he mention anything to you?

20:55.871 --> 20:58.237
- Anything in private?
- Why would he?

20:58.407 --> 21:00.875
- You were his teacher's assistant.
- Oh.

21:01.043 --> 21:04.240
I thought he might've mentioned
if something unusual had happened.

21:04.413 --> 21:07.075
No, he didn't. Nothing.

21:07.249 --> 21:10.548
We've been trying to track Kinberg's
whereabouts over the past week.

21:10.719 --> 21:14.246
We spoke to his wife
and she said that he had arrived home...

21:14.423 --> 21:16.584
...just before midnight
the last two nights...

21:16.758 --> 21:21.752
...but according to his schedule,
his last class started at 6:00.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.023
He's had extended office hours
this week.

21:24.666 --> 21:28.102
Well, could I get a list of the students
he talked to?

21:28.770 --> 21:31.238
It was drop-in. I'm not really sure.

21:33.976 --> 21:35.671
I'm sorry.

21:36.078 --> 21:37.739
After what happened today...

21:39.147 --> 21:41.945
...I feel like nothing's real.
That was crazy.

21:42.117 --> 21:44.642
How long were you seeing him?

21:45.654 --> 21:48.054
Professor Kinberg.

21:57.099 --> 21:59.067
Three months.

21:59.334 --> 22:01.097
I knew he was gonna take the job...

22:01.269 --> 22:03.703
...and he hadn't even told his wife
about it yet.

22:03.872 --> 22:05.066
What job was that?

22:05.941 --> 22:07.465
I shouldn't...

22:07.642 --> 22:09.872
- He wasn't supposed to tell me.
- It's okay.

22:11.013 --> 22:15.006
The CDC. Centers for Disease Control.

22:15.183 --> 22:18.949
They offered him this big job,
which meant moving to Atlanta.

22:19.121 --> 22:21.146
I figured that was gonna be it for us.

22:21.323 --> 22:23.791
- And what exactly was the job?
- Task force.

22:24.326 --> 22:27.955
To oversee the country's preparedness
to fight off an epidemic.

22:28.130 --> 22:30.030
It sounded like a big deal.

22:33.035 --> 22:35.799
- Can I come in?
- I hate that.

22:35.971 --> 22:38.667
Knocking and asking
while you're coming in.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.071
Dr. Kinberg, the professor
who died at Boston College...

22:42.244 --> 22:45.975
...was offered a job at the CDC
to co-chair a classified task force...

22:46.148 --> 22:48.981
...whose sole responsibility
was to respond to epidemics.

22:49.151 --> 22:51.676
- And?
- He wasn't the only scientist asked.

22:51.853 --> 22:55.653
There was another one.
Dr. Russell Simon from Cambridge.

22:55.824 --> 22:58.884
- I'm trying to locate him now.
- You think he's a target too?

22:59.061 --> 23:02.827
I do, and I also think that the people
who killed Kinberg...

23:02.998 --> 23:04.488
...are the people who took me.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.930
- And how'd you make that leap?
- Walter.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.695
He thinks the thing
that killed Dr. Kinberg...

23:09.871 --> 23:13.830
...is similar to evidence that I grabbed
from the people who abducted me.

23:14.009 --> 23:16.876
Why abduct you? What's the link?
Why kill Kinberg like that?

23:17.045 --> 23:21.573
I don't know yet, but so far I figured
why kill an epidemiologist...

23:21.750 --> 23:23.911
...unless you're looking
to start an epidemic?

23:24.086 --> 23:26.577
Get rid of the firefighter
before you start a fire.

23:28.457 --> 23:30.220
Why am I just now hearing of this?

23:30.392 --> 23:34.089
Your friend, Sanford Harris, forbade me
from investigating my own abduction.

23:34.262 --> 23:36.059
Harris.

23:36.865 --> 23:38.765
He's put everything on hold...

23:38.934 --> 23:43.268
...has requested that I run all operations
past him before we move.

23:43.438 --> 23:45.201
- Is that even possible?
- Apparently.

23:45.373 --> 23:47.933
Sir, I'm asking you
to save a man's life.

23:48.110 --> 23:52.240
Are you telling me that you don't
have the authority to let me do my job?

23:53.682 --> 23:55.980
Find Simon.
Get him in protective custody now.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.708
- Thank you.
- I'll handle Harris.

23:57.886 --> 23:58.978
I know you will.

23:59.754 --> 24:03.713
Hey, Rach, it's me. Can we just
meet at the apartment? Is that okay?

24:03.892 --> 24:06.122
Yeah, sure. I have the key.
Is everything okay?

24:06.294 --> 24:07.761
I'm fine. I won't be too late.

24:07.929 --> 24:10.090
If you get hungry
there's food in the fridge.

24:10.265 --> 24:13.928
Or there are some menus by the phone
in the kitchen if you wanna order in.

24:14.102 --> 24:16.570
Don't worry about us at all.
Ella's having a blast.

24:16.738 --> 24:18.968
Okay. I'll see you tonight.
I love you.

24:19.141 --> 24:21.006
You too. Bye.

24:22.144 --> 24:24.510
I'm going to Cambridge
to pick up Russell Simon.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.011
- Who's that?
- A man we're taking into custody.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.446
- I'll give you the details on the way.
- Oh, I'm going with you?

24:30.619 --> 24:33.019
- Yeah.
- Meet you downstairs.

24:35.257 --> 24:36.952
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey.

24:37.125 --> 24:42.495
Listen, Olivia, your abduction.
I'm gonna coordinate the investigation.

24:42.664 --> 24:45.599
I assume everything you remember
is already in your debrief.

24:45.767 --> 24:47.029
Yeah.

24:47.235 --> 24:50.363
If I find anything, I'll let you know.
We'll find him.

24:50.539 --> 24:53.372
That's great, Mitch. Thank you.

25:04.554 --> 25:06.784
Dr. Simon, thank you
for your cooperation.

25:06.956 --> 25:08.981
I suppose I should be thanking you.

25:09.158 --> 25:12.150
FBI tells you they're here
to save your life, you listen.

25:12.361 --> 25:15.558
- I know it must seem confusing.
- Well, it's certainly shocking.

25:15.732 --> 25:18.326
- Miles was a dear friend.
- I'm sorry.

25:18.501 --> 25:23.268
Know that we're doing everything we
can to bring those responsible to justice.

25:24.407 --> 25:26.739
The CDC wasn't expecting me
for three months.

25:26.909 --> 25:29.503
Who else knew
you were planning on taking this job?

25:29.679 --> 25:33.479
Well, no one. Just my wife.
I was instructed not to tell anyone.

25:33.649 --> 25:36.846
And is there anyone you can think of
who might be targeting you?

25:37.019 --> 25:42.252
Maybe students whose grades
they might've felt were undeserved.

25:43.159 --> 25:46.094
Will you excuse us for a moment?
I need to talk to my agents.

25:46.262 --> 25:47.422
Sure.

25:53.536 --> 25:55.629
Can you give us a minute?

25:56.439 --> 26:01.968
So I understand that you have requested
placing Dr. Simon in protective custody.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.113
I believe that his life
may be in danger.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.441
Well, that's taxpayer dollars,
Ms. Dunham...

26:06.616 --> 26:08.481
...and I haven't approved that.

26:08.651 --> 26:09.879
Let me ask you a question.

26:10.052 --> 26:14.455
I enjoy having you here, but how long
are you planning on sticking around?

26:14.624 --> 26:18.958
Until I have made a full assessment
of how this office conducts its business.

26:19.128 --> 26:20.789
Did Broyles approve your request?

26:21.564 --> 26:23.862
No, he did not.

26:30.740 --> 26:33.732
Mr. Harris, you don't like me,
you don't respect me...

26:33.943 --> 26:35.570
...and you think I'm bad at my job.

26:35.745 --> 26:38.646
But don't let that get in the way
of doing the right thing.

26:39.148 --> 26:43.676
That man in there may likely die
if we don't keep him safe.

26:44.187 --> 26:48.351
I'm not asking you to like me.
I'm asking you to do the right thing.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.459
Yeah, we'll keep him safe.

27:01.604 --> 27:02.901
Thank you.

27:08.845 --> 27:11.177
- This is Dunham.
- Walter's trying to determine...

27:11.347 --> 27:14.339
...what that thing is,
but I think we made a breakthrough.

27:14.517 --> 27:17.543
- Okay. So, what is it?
- It seems to be activated by a liquid.

27:18.020 --> 27:20.181
What does? The parasite?

27:20.356 --> 27:23.348
The yellow powdery stuff in the vials?
They're like eggs.

27:23.526 --> 27:25.118
But the catalyst is stomach acid.

27:25.294 --> 27:27.228
So the victim just needs to ingest it.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.762
Exactly right. And then it grows. Fast.

27:32.935 --> 27:35.802
- Thank you.
- No problem.

27:38.140 --> 27:40.370
Is there any way
to trace where it came from?

27:40.543 --> 27:42.238
Walter doesn't think so, no.

27:47.250 --> 27:52.278
Dr. Simon. With your permission,
we'd like to take you to our field office.

27:52.455 --> 27:56.414
We'll debrief you, go over your options.
Then we'll move you to a safe house.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.326
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.961
There'll be agents there on call,
24 hours a day...

28:07.470 --> 28:11.133
This is Agent Francis.
I need medical attention, Room 6.

28:12.675 --> 28:14.472
I called medical assistance...

28:25.054 --> 28:26.112
Oh, my God.

28:42.371 --> 28:43.497
It's viral.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.273
Nasopharyngitis,
albeit a gargantuan specimen.

28:48.444 --> 28:49.536
What does that mean?

28:49.712 --> 28:54.649
This organism is a single specimen
of a virus of a common cold.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.581
So you're saying this is one single cell?

28:58.087 --> 28:59.987
It's not unprecedented.

29:00.156 --> 29:03.387
The ostrich egg is a single cell
and it can grow up to five pounds.

29:03.592 --> 29:06.390
They supersized the common cold,
which is disgusting.

29:06.595 --> 29:09.496
- Obviously somebody is playing with us.
- They're showing off.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.725
- Killing epidemiologists with a cold.
- It is impressive.

29:12.902 --> 29:15.063
I wanna know
what they wanted from you.

29:15.237 --> 29:17.967
Oh, who cares about me?
I wanna know who's next.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.233
I care about you.

29:20.977 --> 29:22.911
If we can figure out
why they need you...

29:23.112 --> 29:25.876
...then maybe we can figure out
who's next.

29:29.885 --> 29:31.079
I'm gonna keep looking...

29:31.253 --> 29:34.745
...for someone who's connected
to Kinberg and Simon.

29:37.893 --> 29:39.360
She is beautiful, isn't she?

29:40.896 --> 29:44.161
- Who?
- The slug.

30:04.887 --> 30:10.519
- You know, I could have cooked for you.
- Oh, no thanks, I've tasted your cooking.

30:10.693 --> 30:12.524
Hey, I've gotten really good,
you know.

30:12.695 --> 30:14.686
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

30:14.864 --> 30:19.198
- No, I haven't.
- I didn't think so.

30:20.302 --> 30:23.066
- Hard day?
- Heh.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.398
I honestly wouldn't know
what to tell you.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.271
And if I did, it would be a felony.

30:29.445 --> 30:33.575
- You have a crazy job.
- Yeah, I have a crazy job.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.877
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:41.690 --> 30:42.918
Have you heard from Greg?

30:52.301 --> 30:54.826
I don't know how to do this alone.

30:55.004 --> 30:59.065
Ella is beautiful and smart and strong,
and she gets that from you.

30:59.241 --> 31:02.472
Me? No, you've always been
the strong one, you have.

31:02.645 --> 31:04.306
Rach...

31:05.948 --> 31:08.815
I've only done one thing right
in my life.

31:09.285 --> 31:11.344
Then you need to be strong for her.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.820
Whatever you need, I'm here.

31:15.424 --> 31:19.019
And you guys can stay here
as long as you want.

31:21.630 --> 31:22.790
Thank you.

31:26.535 --> 31:31.302
Is there something else?
Something you're not telling me?

31:31.874 --> 31:33.466
No.

31:34.043 --> 31:36.102
No, there's nothing else.

31:54.063 --> 31:56.657
- How goes it?
- Horrible.

31:57.333 --> 32:00.962
We'll find him, whoever's responsible
for what happened.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.329
Maybe this'll help.

32:28.597 --> 32:30.792
I need to talk to you.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.693
Charlie,
I think I know who killed Simon...

32:33.869 --> 32:36.702
...and I think it's the same person
who abducted me.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.499
Who?

32:38.908 --> 32:42.002
Mitchell Loeb. Don't ask me
how I know, I'll tell you later.

32:42.178 --> 32:47.548
- Livvy, that can't be right.
- It is. And I can prove it.

32:47.716 --> 32:51.379
But I've got Harris watching me like
a prison guard. I can't do this myself.

32:54.823 --> 32:56.518
What do you need?

33:47.409 --> 33:51.038
- Walter, is that LSD?
- LSD? Why would I...?

33:52.348 --> 33:57.342
It's a decongestant.
She is a giant cold virus, after all.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.512
Right.

34:02.791 --> 34:06.192
Peter. You got a moment?

34:12.034 --> 34:13.524
What's up?

34:13.702 --> 34:16.637
Olivia may have a lead
on who abducted her.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.899
Only she can't pursue it
without some help.

34:20.074 --> 34:22.202
- I can't help her.
- Why not?

34:22.378 --> 34:26.576
Suffice it to say that sometimes the
problem with being in law enforcement...

34:26.748 --> 34:28.808
...is that you gotta obey the law
yourself.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.849
You think I'm the guy
to break the law.

34:31.020 --> 34:33.011
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- No, you're right.

34:33.188 --> 34:35.850
I am the guy to break the law for you.
What do we need?

34:39.762 --> 34:41.195
I need a wiretap.

34:41.964 --> 34:47.527
- On who?
- Mitchell Loeb, FBI.

35:00.215 --> 35:01.910
Hello?

35:06.121 --> 35:09.784
- Samantha.
- Olivia, hi.

35:10.592 --> 35:15.529
I was just in Marlborough. I thought
I'd drop by, just to see if you're okay.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.623
I don't understand.

35:19.435 --> 35:23.394
I don't know, I guess I hadn't
talked to you since Mitchell's surgery.

35:24.473 --> 35:25.872
Oh.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.240
Well, how sweet of you.

35:31.413 --> 35:34.746
Would you like to come inside?
Have a cup of tea?

35:35.818 --> 35:37.718
Yeah, thank you.

35:42.758 --> 35:44.555
I've been thinking a lot about you...

35:44.727 --> 35:47.218
...and everything that you and Mitchell
went through.

35:47.396 --> 35:51.799
- It's lovely having him back at the office.
- Oh, yes, he's really glad to be back.

35:52.968 --> 35:55.300
His recovery seemed to go smoothly.

35:57.172 --> 35:59.299
What were you doing in Marlborough?

35:59.975 --> 36:02.341
I'm working on a case.

36:03.178 --> 36:04.577
Well, what's the case?

36:06.315 --> 36:08.476
Suspicion of a double agent.

36:16.658 --> 36:18.125
Excuse me.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.054
I'll get the tea.

36:21.864 --> 36:23.923
Mind if I use your bathroom?

36:25.100 --> 36:28.263
- It's down the hall.
- Thank you.

36:30.439 --> 36:33.670
Kyle. Hey, man...
Can you grab me that phone?

36:33.842 --> 36:36.777
All right, go ahead. Uh-huh.

36:38.113 --> 36:41.549
Okay, so I enter the phone number
and then just punch in that code.

36:41.717 --> 36:44.948
Kyle, you are the greatest, man.
Have I told you that lately?

36:45.821 --> 36:47.152
Yeah, thanks, you too.

36:47.823 --> 36:50.792
He used to work at the phone company,
I never understood why.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.620
- The guy's a genius.
- You're right.

36:52.795 --> 36:54.956
You don't wanna waste
any of that potential.

36:56.331 --> 36:57.798
He tapped into
the Loebs' home phone.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.730
We should be able to pick up
any outgoing calls they make.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.006
This is Mitchell.

37:13.182 --> 37:16.674
- Olivia Dunham is in our house.
- Why?

37:16.852 --> 37:20.015
She claims she was here
to check on you.

37:25.060 --> 37:26.857
Is it working?

37:28.630 --> 37:30.120
No.

37:31.066 --> 37:34.502
Kyle, it's not working. All I'm getting
is buzz. I don't hear anything.

37:35.137 --> 37:39.198
- I think she knows.
- I don't know how she could.

37:40.142 --> 37:43.771
- I don't know what to do.
- Well, I do.

37:43.946 --> 37:46.437
And you have to move fast.

37:48.884 --> 37:50.749
You need to kill her.

37:51.653 --> 37:53.382
Right now.

38:12.407 --> 38:15.035
Her office might know that she's here.
How can I just...

38:15.210 --> 38:17.701
Dunham's already under suspicion
for being unstable.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.472
They think she's dangerous.

38:19.648 --> 38:21.912
All right, I'll try it again.

38:41.737 --> 38:43.170
Whew.

38:44.540 --> 38:48.840
We can say she came after you,
that it was self-defense.

38:49.011 --> 38:52.913
- There has to be another way to do this.
- There isn't, honey. There's one way.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.244
You cannot let Dunham
leave there alive.

38:56.418 --> 39:01.515
In the entry closet, top shelf,
in the back, there's a gun.

39:02.391 --> 39:04.916
Contact me when it's done.

39:06.428 --> 39:08.055
- What is it?
- Olivia's in trouble.

39:08.230 --> 39:09.697
- What happened?
- Hold on.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.442
Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up.

39:33.121 --> 39:34.213
It's me.

39:34.389 --> 39:36.414
Get out of the house,
she's gonna kill you.

39:36.592 --> 39:38.617
- What?
- Samantha Loeb is going to kill you.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.819
Get out of the house right now.

39:52.941 --> 39:54.067
Olivia.

39:55.944 --> 39:58.003
Tea's ready.

40:05.721 --> 40:07.586
Olivia.

40:19.101 --> 40:25.006
Samantha. Turn around
and put the gun on the ground.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.266
Put the gun down.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.009
Now get down on the ground.

40:35.817 --> 40:37.785
Samantha.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.848
Please. Don't hurt me.

40:41.023 --> 40:42.183
Get on the ground.

40:42.357 --> 40:45.690
- I was doing what my husband asked.
- Samantha, get down on the ground.

40:45.861 --> 40:48.728
- I don't wanna shoot you, but I will.
- Are you gonna hurt me?

40:48.897 --> 40:51.798
Damn it, Samantha, shut up
and get down on the ground.

40:51.967 --> 40:53.628
Please, get down...

41:33.675 --> 41:36.610
There's nothing here.
Loeb knew he was gonna cut and run.

41:36.812 --> 41:39.906
- You have nothing to trace.
- No, nothing yet.

41:40.082 --> 41:43.882
I'll need more time
to trace the origin of the virus.

41:44.052 --> 41:47.044
But even then, it would be impossible
to know the exact origin.

41:47.222 --> 41:51.090
Liv, I hate to even ask you this. Anything
you remember from when they had you?

41:51.259 --> 41:54.092
No. There's nothing that I heard,
nothing that I remember.

41:54.262 --> 41:56.253
There's no other way
to track Loeb's cell?

41:56.431 --> 41:59.298
- Tech services tried everything.
- Wait, not everything.

41:59.468 --> 42:02.437
The agents are surveilling the area,
right? No sign of Loeb?

42:02.604 --> 42:04.765
- Not yet.
- So he doesn't know about his wife.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.773
- No, he doesn't.
- Meaning she could still contact him.

42:07.943 --> 42:11.037
- I'm ahead of you. I'll get a team.
- What happened? I missed it.

42:11.213 --> 42:13.681
Okay, we need Samantha's
cell phone. Inventory has it.

42:13.849 --> 42:15.077
- I'm on it.
- Nice work.

42:15.250 --> 42:17.047
Thanks.

42:37.739 --> 42:40.003
It's all rather tense, isn't it?

42:41.076 --> 42:45.570
He's gonna come. Assuming, of course,
they text each other.

42:46.681 --> 42:50.674
- Do you see him yet?
- No, not yet.

42:51.453 --> 42:53.944
Peter was worried about you
when you were gone.

42:54.122 --> 42:55.146
- Walter...
- You were.

42:55.323 --> 42:58.952
- Well, of course I was worried.
- He was really worried.

43:09.604 --> 43:11.504
We got him.

43:24.419 --> 43:25.852
Stay here.

43:40.001 --> 43:42.435
Mitchell. Put it down, put it down.

43:43.939 --> 43:45.429
Freeze.

43:45.907 --> 43:47.135
Aah!

43:48.476 --> 43:50.444
Drop it. Drop your weapon.

43:54.950 --> 43:56.315
You're under arrest.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.328
Nice work.

44:09.097 --> 44:10.826
Thank you.

44:17.105 --> 44:18.470
Who are you working for?

44:22.010 --> 44:24.478
Don't be an idiot, Loeb.

44:24.646 --> 44:27.513
This is your one chance to cooperate.

44:27.682 --> 44:31.379
I'd say to you that you have no idea how
hard we're gonna come down on you...

44:31.553 --> 44:33.214
...except you do.

44:33.855 --> 44:36.016
I wanna see my wife.

44:37.926 --> 44:39.985
You're not getting a thing
until you talk.

44:40.161 --> 44:42.026
Then you're out of luck.

44:42.197 --> 44:46.395
Why'd you kill them?
Kinberg and Simon? And why like that?

44:46.568 --> 44:49.867
I mean, there are easier ways
to take somebody out.

44:51.139 --> 44:53.130
You're getting nothing.

44:53.475 --> 44:56.501
She can't do it.
She won't get a confession.

44:56.678 --> 44:58.737
I'd say the evidence in his house
is plenty.

44:59.247 --> 45:01.340
I'd say evidence is no confession.

45:01.549 --> 45:04.211
Ask as many questions as you want.

45:04.386 --> 45:06.684
Why take me?

45:06.855 --> 45:09.722
And that spinal tap,
what did you want?

45:10.091 --> 45:12.355
Look, this is your last chance
to cooperate.

45:12.527 --> 45:15.724
Or what? You'll torture me?

45:23.004 --> 45:24.767
Can you leave me alone with him?

45:33.114 --> 45:34.172
What's she doing?

45:34.349 --> 45:36.510
You want your wife, Mitch?

45:37.118 --> 45:39.518
Yeah, Olivia, I do.

45:48.430 --> 45:50.193
Okay.

46:02.377 --> 46:04.072
Okay.

46:12.887 --> 46:15.515
And do you wanna know
who pulled the trigger?

46:17.659 --> 46:19.286
Mitch.

46:21.162 --> 46:22.959
You're looking at her.

46:25.667 --> 46:26.929
Did you kill them?

46:30.038 --> 46:31.096
- Did you...?
- Yes!

46:32.474 --> 46:36.433
Do you not understand the rules?
What we're up against?

46:36.611 --> 46:39.171
Who the two sides are?
Tell me at least you know that.

46:39.347 --> 46:43.443
- Who's we?
- We had a plan here, lady.

46:43.618 --> 46:45.415
We had a shot.

46:46.154 --> 46:48.782
- And you just blew it.
- Why did you kidnap me?

46:48.957 --> 46:52.085
Kidnap you. Idiot.

46:52.260 --> 46:54.626
- We saved you.
- Saved me from what?

46:54.796 --> 46:57.264
We were going to let you go.
We saved you.

47:00.135 --> 47:04.970
You have no idea what you've done.

47:06.207 --> 47:08.072
Not a clue.

47:17.452 --> 47:18.851
There's your confession.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.661
You need to get some rest.

47:34.903 --> 47:39.602
- I think you've earned it.
- I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you.

47:41.109 --> 47:42.474
Thank you.

47:42.644 --> 47:46.512
He's right. You should get home.

47:47.482 --> 47:49.973
What did he mean he saved me?
What the hell was that?

47:50.151 --> 47:52.551
- He was messing with you.
- I don't know.

47:52.720 --> 47:55.985
Did you see him? There was something
about the way he said that...

47:56.157 --> 47:58.057
The man's insane, Olivia.

47:58.226 --> 48:02.720
I concur, and in the category of
"It takes one to know one."

48:02.897 --> 48:06.333
- That man did seem disturbed.
- Then why take me?

48:06.501 --> 48:09.493
They wanted to hurt you.
They knew you were investigating them.

48:09.671 --> 48:12.697
- They wanted to take you out.
- Then why not just kill me?

48:12.874 --> 48:16.037
You're talking about a man
who infects people with giant viruses.

48:16.211 --> 48:19.044
If you hadn't escaped, who knows
what they would have done?

48:19.214 --> 48:22.206
Listen to me. You just told him
that you killed his wife.

48:22.383 --> 48:25.910
He said that to you to try and get
a reaction out of you, to get to you.

48:26.087 --> 48:27.179
Let it go.

48:28.690 --> 48:31.090
You got his confession.

48:32.193 --> 48:33.660
Go home.

48:35.029 --> 48:38.795
I was worried too,
when you were taken.

48:39.467 --> 48:41.401
Thank you, Walter.

48:45.406 --> 48:47.431
Not as much as him, of course.

48:47.609 --> 48:50.373
- Walter...
- It's true.
