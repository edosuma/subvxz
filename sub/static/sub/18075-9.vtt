WEBVTT

00:02.531 --> 00:06.116
[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:06.203 --> 00:08.114
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:08.207 --> 00:13.002
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:13.089 --> 00:16.710
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:16.804 --> 00:20.886
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:20.977 --> 00:23.018
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

02:59.770 --> 03:02.723
What are we doin' here?

03:04.152 --> 03:06.276
What are we waitin' for?

03:10.788 --> 03:12.912
Patience, B.A.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.993
Face, hold still.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.089
Boy, these mosquitoes
are killers.

03:19.176 --> 03:21.086
- You get him?
- Yeah.

03:21.179 --> 03:24.633
- Look at the size of that sucker.
- Unbelievable!

03:27.189 --> 03:28.981
[Plane Engine Droning]

03:29.067 --> 03:31.357
- Uh, do you know the words to...
- What?

03:31.445 --> 03:36.075
[Both] # You are my sunshine
my only sunshine #

03:36.161 --> 03:39.413
[Harmonizing] # You make me happy
when skies are grey ##

03:39.500 --> 03:42.039
Shut up! What's that noise?

03:49.975 --> 03:53.346
- Sounds like a jeep.
- Sounds like a supercharged jeep.

03:53.439 --> 03:55.812
Sounds like an aeroplane to me.

03:55.901 --> 03:58.524
Uh, well, it's probably
the guerillas' aeroplane.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.284
If that"s Murdock, l"m not gettin"
in the air with that crazy sucker.

04:01.368 --> 04:06.246
B.A., you really, really have to
lighten up on this paranoia
you have about flying.

04:06.334 --> 04:09.123
Hold still, B.A.

04:09.214 --> 04:12.916
Got him! That's a monster!
Look at that.

04:13.011 --> 04:14.922
Mmm!
[Clicks Tongue]

04:15.014 --> 04:18.017
- Thanks, Hannibal.
- It's okay, pal.

04:18.103 --> 04:20.012
Right.

04:20.106 --> 04:21.767
[Horn Honking]

04:21.858 --> 04:24.695
- Why does he always fall on the horn?
- Beats me.

04:35.589 --> 04:38.164
Shall we?

04:38.260 --> 04:40.253
I love to crash parties.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.628
[Coughing]

06:07.484 --> 06:09.395
Is he down yet?

06:14.996 --> 06:16.741
Almost.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.048
That-a-boy, Murdock!

06:59.650 --> 07:01.561
[Voice Echoing On Speaker]
Ladies and gentlemen...

07:01.654 --> 07:06.069
the captain has just turned on the
"no smoking" and "fasten your seat belt"
sign for taxiing and take-off.

07:06.161 --> 07:08.867
Please make sure that your seats are
in the upright and forward position...

07:08.957 --> 07:11.414
and that your table trays
are secured in front of you.

07:11.502 --> 07:13.413
Please sit back
and enjoy your flight.

07:13.506 --> 07:16.294
Let's go, Murdock!

07:36.083 --> 07:37.993
[Yelling]

07:38.086 --> 07:41.754
Ya-hoo!

07:41.842 --> 07:44.169
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!

07:46.850 --> 07:49.224
[Chuckling]

07:49.312 --> 07:53.229
Speak of the devil.
This is Amy Allen.

07:53.319 --> 07:55.811
Hi. I'm Mitchell Barnes,
U.P.I.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.529
Mitch just got back
from covering the crisis in Lebanon.

07:58.619 --> 08:00.613
He'll be in L.A.
for a couple of days...

08:00.705 --> 08:04.076
and, uh, he wanted to meet
the person who filed the story
on the Jamestown incident.

08:04.169 --> 08:06.293
Excellent,
excellent example...

08:06.381 --> 08:09.467
- of infield journalistic
investigative technique.
- Of what?

08:09.553 --> 08:13.387
Reminded me a lot of that story
I filed from Belgrade in '71.
You happen to read that?

08:13.476 --> 08:15.516
Ran in Time, Newsweek, Life.

08:15.604 --> 08:18.275
I might have. I was a sophomore
in high school at the time.

08:18.358 --> 08:20.269
I'd love to compare
battle notes with you.

08:20.362 --> 08:23.697
- What do you say we grab a bite
to eat before we hit the Law Spa?
- The what?

08:23.784 --> 08:28.329
The Law Spa. That's what we wiremen
call the courtrooms. Kind of catchy, huh?

08:28.416 --> 08:31.205
Mitch wants to sit in on
the Caldwell murder trial.
You're covering that, aren't you?

08:31.296 --> 08:34.298
Well, yeah, but the trial
was moved back until 4.00.

08:34.384 --> 08:37.755
- Actually, I can"t this afternoon.
- You"ve got nothing to say about it.
It"s settled.

08:37.847 --> 08:41.183
- Mitch, talk to you later. Okay?
- Do you have a phone I could use?

08:41.270 --> 08:44.771
- Uh, yeah, on that desk
right over there.
- Oh, thanks.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.707
[Beeps]

08:57.796 --> 08:59.706
This is Captain Stewart.
Go.

08:59.799 --> 09:02.718
I've hooked up with the skirt.
We're comin' out.

09:02.804 --> 09:06.886
- You guys are really gonna
owe me one for this.
- Barnes, we've played ball before.

09:06.977 --> 09:11.227
Personally, I think it's a long shot,
but Lynch seems to think this Amy Allen
might be working with the A-Team.

09:11.317 --> 09:13.228
- She hired 'em once.
- Maybe he's right.

09:13.321 --> 09:16.774
If I were working on a story like
the A-Team, I wouldn't give it up either.
Bet your captain's bars on it.

09:16.868 --> 09:20.405
You've got the tailing device, so stick
with her. We'll be about a block back.

09:20.499 --> 09:22.991
- Time's a-wasting.
- Okay.

09:31.349 --> 09:33.592
[Hannibal]
Face, I can"t believe it.

09:33.686 --> 09:37.817
That was the sloppiest, most
unprofessional job I've ever seen you do.

09:37.901 --> 09:42.067
I did the best I could. I got you through
Customs and over to the church, didn't I?

09:42.158 --> 09:45.695
- But why wasn't the bridge dynamited?
- Ah, well...

09:45.789 --> 09:49.741
Now, look, kid.
I like a little shoot-'em-up now and then.
It keeps the adrenaline going.

09:49.837 --> 09:52.460
But it was not part of my plan
to be chased...

09:52.549 --> 09:55.006
by the Guatemalan army
to the airport.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.848
Oh, the archbishop's
gonna be real happy.

09:57.933 --> 10:00.093
We got him his money back.

10:00.186 --> 10:03.189
That"ll teach the government
to try and throw the clergy
out of the country...

10:03.275 --> 10:05.601
and then steal
their building-fund money.

10:05.695 --> 10:07.606
Yeah. You do have a point there.

10:07.698 --> 10:10.155
I like working for the church
now and then.

10:10.244 --> 10:12.154
Insurance
against Judgement Day.

10:12.247 --> 10:14.621
[Engine Chugging]

10:16.295 --> 10:18.622
Knock it off, you guys!

10:21.846 --> 10:24.338
Uh...

10:24.433 --> 10:26.641
are you having a problem,
Murdock?

10:32.404 --> 10:35.573
Well, it's hard to tell with these.

10:35.659 --> 10:37.819
With these?
What do you mean, "with these"?

10:37.913 --> 10:40.951
- Where" d you get this plane, Face?
- Face didn't scam it. I did.

10:41.043 --> 10:44.746
- What?
- Well, I-I had to con
the passport people.

10:44.841 --> 10:48.461
Okay. Murdock,
where did you get this bird?

10:48.555 --> 10:51.178
I clipped it off
of the rental plane repair line.

10:54.648 --> 10:59.443
It would be ridiculous for me
to assume that it'd been fixed.

10:59.531 --> 11:02.201
Of course it wasn't fixed.
They start to miss 'em
once they've been fixed.

11:02.285 --> 11:05.241
- You gotta get 'em before they're fixed.
- Of course.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.491
Uh, Murdock?
What's gonna happen?

11:08.670 --> 11:11.875
- Looks like we're gonna crash.
- No, come on, really.
What's gonna happen?

11:13.094 --> 11:17.010
- It looks like we're gonna crash and die.
- I'll get the parachute.

11:24.278 --> 11:26.188
Four thousand feet
and dropping.

11:28.910 --> 11:31.830
This thing's got the glide
characteristics of a free-falling safe.

11:31.915 --> 11:35.582
- Where are we, Murdock?
- I don't know.
Somewhere in South Carolina.

11:35.671 --> 11:38.543
Uh, I think.
I've been dead reckoning it.

11:38.634 --> 11:42.681
This funny little thing
that points and spins ain"t workin'.

11:49.443 --> 11:52.280
There's just one parachute.
I'll jump and go for help.

11:52.364 --> 11:55.866
Too low, too late to jump.

11:55.953 --> 11:59.289
- He got this plane off a repair line?
- Okay!

11:59.375 --> 12:02.912
Find a comfy little spot
and hold on!

12:50.122 --> 12:52.793
[Murdock On P.A.]
Ladies and gentlemen,
that concludes your flight.

12:52.877 --> 12:57.091
Thank you for flying Miracle Airlines,
the only airline where Lady Luck
is your co-pilot.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.798
[Chuckles Quietly]

12:59.888 --> 13:02.926
Easy for you to laugh.

13:07.817 --> 13:10.310
We're probably the only guys
to survive an aeroplane crash...

13:10.405 --> 13:12.897
only to be killed minutes later
by an irate passenger.

13:20.671 --> 13:23.163
[Murdock] Another satisfied customer.
See, he"s not complaining.

13:23.258 --> 13:26.712
- Here we go. One, two, three!
- Two, three!

13:26.806 --> 13:29.974
Oh!
I got him, I got him, I got him.

13:30.061 --> 13:32.980
[Hannibal]
Hang on to him a second.

13:33.066 --> 13:37.148
- Anybody know
how much this man weighs?
- God, man! He's heavy!

13:38.741 --> 13:42.112
- I ain't knockin' him out no more.
- This is the last time I'm carrying him.

13:42.205 --> 13:46.537
You think it's easy on this end?
I got 200 pounds of gold
pullin' me down.

13:46.629 --> 13:48.706
Maybe it would help
if we took the jewellery off.

13:48.799 --> 13:52.134
No. Can't. I think he's got it
hooked up to a burglar alarm.

13:52.221 --> 13:54.760
[Snoring, Moans]

13:54.850 --> 13:57.936
[Grunting] Put me down!
Put me down! Put me down!

13:58.022 --> 13:59.932
Put me down!
Put me down.

14:00.025 --> 14:05.105
Face, check the rear,
see if we lost those guerrillas.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.526
Lost them? Where are we?

14:07.620 --> 14:10.991
They've been following us
for two hours.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.078
It's all clear... for now, Colonel...

14:13.171 --> 14:15.330
but those guerrillas are tricky.

14:15.424 --> 14:20.255
- They could be flanking us
up on that ridge there.
- Sergeant, how're you feeling?

14:20.349 --> 14:22.758
Boy, that concussion grenade...

14:22.853 --> 14:24.893
almost put your lights out
for good, man.

14:24.981 --> 14:26.939
Concussion? Grenade?

14:27.026 --> 14:29.519
All I remember is
being bit by a mosquito.

14:29.613 --> 14:32.865
- Where did you come from?
- When I get that figured out,
I can drop out of analysis.

14:32.952 --> 14:36.074
- Face, take the point.
- Anybody want to switch?

14:36.166 --> 14:37.791
Face!

14:37.877 --> 14:40.084
B.A., take the rear.
Murdock, follow me.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.415
This don't look like
Guatemala to me!

14:42.509 --> 14:45.180
Well, it ain't South Carolina.

14:51.315 --> 14:55.778
- Pine trees?
- South American Chi-Chi trees,
but they're related.

14:55.863 --> 14:58.071
[Man]
We decide how much we pay you.

14:58.159 --> 15:01.909
Let me tell you something, mister.
We got a code among us.

15:01.998 --> 15:04.917
We got no time for folks
who don't respect our rules.

15:05.003 --> 15:08.255
- Ain't that right, boys?
- Right. We got a code.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.799
It's all agreed, now.

15:10.887 --> 15:13.261
- Fire him up, boys!
- [Men] Yeah! Yeah!

15:13.349 --> 15:15.557
Are they doing
what I think they're doing?

15:15.645 --> 15:17.888
Are they burning that guy
at the stake?

15:17.982 --> 15:21.816
Since we don"t know what"s going on,
let"s run these guys off.

15:21.905 --> 15:25.774
Besides...
Baby's a little low on ammo.

15:25.869 --> 15:28.872
B.A.,
take the right flank.

15:28.958 --> 15:31.580
Face, take the left.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.997
Murdock...

15:34.091 --> 15:36.084
cover the rear.

15:44.357 --> 15:48.108
What are you fellas doin'?
You havin' a cookout?

15:48.196 --> 15:50.155
Kill him!

15:50.241 --> 15:52.816
Return fire!

16:10.148 --> 16:11.892
[Gun Clicking]

16:35.354 --> 16:37.229
[Clicking]

16:38.401 --> 16:41.439
Get out of here
or you're all dead!

16:43.492 --> 16:45.985
Let's get out of here!

16:55.303 --> 16:57.878
- B.A., you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay!

16:57.974 --> 16:59.884
- Murdock?
- Yeah. I'm okay!

16:59.977 --> 17:02.600
Face?

17:04.733 --> 17:07.108
Face!

17:07.196 --> 17:10.781
[Murdock] His position"s been overrun.
Those men are after him.

17:18.339 --> 17:22.339
Okay.
Let's get this guy down.

17:22.429 --> 17:25.135
- Give me a hand, Murdock. B.A.
- Okay.

17:25.224 --> 17:27.183
- You got him?
- Yeah.

17:27.270 --> 17:29.893
- Ammo report.
- I'm out.

17:29.983 --> 17:34.315
- l"ve got five rounds left in my.45.
- I got three rounds left in my.45.
My rifle's empty.

17:34.406 --> 17:36.365
Okay, let's get back
to the plane.

17:36.451 --> 17:38.991
- Plane? What plane?
- Sergeant, grab Baby.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.991
Bring up the rear.

17:41.084 --> 17:43.837
Stay in tight, Murdock,
on the point.

18:19.269 --> 18:21.940
- Hello.
- Get up.

18:23.943 --> 18:27.195
[Sighs, Groans]

18:27.282 --> 18:30.238
Well, I, uh...
I guess you caught me.

18:32.624 --> 18:34.748
[Grunts]

18:43.057 --> 18:45.846
We ain't restin' until every one of'em
trespassers are caught and punished.

18:45.936 --> 18:47.895
Every one of'em.

18:50.527 --> 18:53.862
Murdock,
give me a hand.

18:53.949 --> 18:57.783
See if we can get him
under this tail section here.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.659
[Hannibal Grunts]

19:04.341 --> 19:06.963
We gotta set up a perimeter.

19:07.053 --> 19:10.424
Murdock, get some shrouds off
that parachute. Set up some trip wires.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.427
We ain't in Guatemala
no more.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.644
Them guys back there
was hillbillies.

19:14.732 --> 19:16.642
Murdock crashed the plane,
didn't he?

19:16.735 --> 19:18.812
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

19:18.905 --> 19:21.480
I simply relocated the aircraft
with extreme prejudice...

19:21.576 --> 19:25.161
because of a total loss
of thrust and lift functions!

19:25.249 --> 19:28.417
- You crashed it, sucker!
- Sergeant!

19:28.504 --> 19:30.747
Now, we did put you
aboard this plane.

19:30.841 --> 19:34.971
You were unconscious because
we took a hit on that truck in Guatemala.

19:35.056 --> 19:38.676
Now, Murdock risked his life
and flew in and rescued us.

19:38.770 --> 19:42.106
- I should be given a medal.
- You're both gonna eat medals.
I die before I fly!

19:42.192 --> 19:46.691
Put it on hold, Sergeant!
I'm not gonna stand around and argue.
This man is dying!

19:50.121 --> 19:53.208
I don't like you guys
always lying to me, man.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.287
Now, we don't always
lie to you, B.A.

19:55.380 --> 19:57.290
That isn't fair,
and you know it.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.670
[Panting]
Boy, that was close.

20:00.763 --> 20:03.256
Those Guatemalan hill troops
are real tough customers.

20:04.352 --> 20:07.271
- What's up?
- I'll tell you what's up.

20:07.357 --> 20:10.609
I know you guys lied to me.
I know you put me on an aeroplane.

20:10.696 --> 20:12.654
And I know Murdock crashed it.

20:12.741 --> 20:17.489
B.A. Baracus gonna take that lie
out of each and every one of your hides.

20:17.582 --> 20:20.501
B.A., you got something there.
Murdock.

20:20.586 --> 20:24.918
Better get those trip wires out,
and don"t forget the last belt
for the M-60.

20:25.010 --> 20:27.549
Those guys could be on us
any minute.

20:27.639 --> 20:30.262
This plane sticks out
like a fly on a wedding cake.

20:30.352 --> 20:33.354
B.A., you better watch
our back trail.

20:44.499 --> 20:47.870
I wonder what they got
against this guy.

20:47.963 --> 20:50.290
"James McDonald...

20:50.384 --> 20:52.377
age 54."

20:52.470 --> 20:54.879
- He"s got three kids.
- This guy works for the county.

20:54.974 --> 20:58.594
Here's a surveyor's map.
They're gonna put a highway in up here.

20:58.688 --> 21:01.940
Murdock, come here.

21:02.027 --> 21:05.315
Can you make any sense
out of this?

21:05.407 --> 21:07.366
Yeah. Yeah.
That's the peak right there.

21:07.452 --> 21:10.954
That"s the one we barely missed
when we came in.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.914
And we almost hit that summit
right there.

21:15.382 --> 21:18.587
[Sighs]
We're surrounded by mountains.

21:18.678 --> 21:22.346
Okay, we can climb over 'em
and leave him here...

21:22.434 --> 21:24.891
or we can stay here
and try and keep him alive.

21:24.980 --> 21:28.481
- We never left any wounded
back in 'Nam, Colonel.
- That's right.

21:28.569 --> 21:30.563
Okay.

21:31.949 --> 21:33.990
We stay.

21:34.078 --> 21:38.078
Uh, Hannibal, how are we
gonna get this guy outta here?

21:38.168 --> 21:40.956
They show movies at the hospital
every Thursday night.

21:41.047 --> 21:44.085
We get old ones mostly, but some...
some are all right, you know?

21:44.177 --> 21:48.011
Look, Murdock!
I'm on a real short leash here,
and I'm getting tired of your crazy rap!

21:48.100 --> 21:51.056
Flight of the Phoenix.
Last Thursday night they showed
Flight of the Phoenix.

21:51.147 --> 21:54.517
These guys crash in the desert,
and they fix their aircraft
by redesigning it.

21:54.610 --> 21:59.240
Will you let go of my arm
before I get gangrene! Man!

22:00.536 --> 22:03.954
I could design an ultralight.

22:04.042 --> 22:06.416
It's like a hang glider
with a motor.

22:06.504 --> 22:10.089
Seats two. I could fly out of here
with our patient. You guys could take off.

22:10.177 --> 22:11.921
- A motor?
- Yeah.

22:12.013 --> 22:15.680
- How long would it take?
- Depends on how long it takes
to get what I need.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.059
- With wings?
- Flap, flap.

22:18.148 --> 22:19.809
Just like 'Nam.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.811
And "Nam was no picnic,
believe me.

22:21.904 --> 22:24.396
There I was, perched between
the U.S. bunkers and Charlie.

22:24.491 --> 22:27.114
There were weapons and bullets
everywhere.

22:27.204 --> 22:29.957
I know what you're saying.
"This guy is crazy."

22:30.041 --> 22:34.505
But my answer to that is,
if you're gonna cover a war,
you cover a war.

22:35.801 --> 22:39.635
I would've stayed to the bitter end,
but my boss wanted me
to cover the Middle East.

22:39.724 --> 22:43.426
But I guarantee you, by then I saw
more action than 90 percent of the G.I.s.

22:43.521 --> 22:46.477
- Really?
- By the way, who are
these friends you're meeting?

22:46.568 --> 22:48.977
- Oh, nobody newsworthy.
- Hmm.

22:49.072 --> 22:51.695
So that's how I came to be
in the Middle East for the Six-Day War.

22:51.784 --> 22:53.862
Six days?
I made it a full week.

22:53.954 --> 22:57.456
I knew every tollbooth
from Kangnung to the 40th parallel.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.668
And they weren't taking tokens,
believe me.

22:59.755 --> 23:03.043
I mean, your life wasn't worth a dime
out there. We're talkin' survival here.

23:03.136 --> 23:06.507
You gotta know,
the regular troops figured that
if my porch light wasn't out...

23:06.599 --> 23:08.510
it was at least blinking.

23:08.603 --> 23:12.223
But I knew the stories were hidden
in that jungle, and I had to find 'em.

23:12.317 --> 23:15.023
- Is that so?
- [Car Door Alarm Dinging]

23:15.113 --> 23:17.652
Is this where we're
picking up your friends?

23:17.742 --> 23:20.032
Guess they're not on time.

23:20.121 --> 23:24.121
- What was their E.T.A.?
- Around now.

23:24.211 --> 23:27.379
Huh. Gee, it doesn't even look
like there's anybody here to ask.

23:27.466 --> 23:31.762
Well, let's wait a while. I mean,
they're always a little bit late anyway.

23:31.848 --> 23:34.091
Maybe they got into
some trouble.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.478
[Grunting]

24:12.829 --> 24:14.823
Hey, Face. Come here.

24:19.799 --> 24:21.709
"Two 10-inch wheels.

24:21.802 --> 24:24.294
- A 10, uh..." What?
- Horsie power.

24:24.389 --> 24:28.176
"Horsie power engine.
Three bolts of industrial silk."

24:28.271 --> 24:30.348
- Are you nuts?
- Absolutely and totally.

24:30.441 --> 24:32.933
How am I gonna get all this stuff
in the middle of nowhere?

24:33.028 --> 24:35.485
- You always say you can get
anything, anywhere, anytime,
- Yeah, but...

24:35.574 --> 24:39.740
Think of it as a challenge.
How did you get that '53 Cadillac
in the jungles of'Nam?

24:39.831 --> 24:43.367
How did you get that '53
Cadillac in the jungles of'Nam?

24:43.461 --> 24:45.372
Professional secret.

24:45.464 --> 24:48.301
Of course,
he was a lot younger then.

24:56.148 --> 24:58.106
Industrial silk.

25:07.166 --> 25:11.000
The guy
is absolutely incredible.

25:13.258 --> 25:15.751
- Come on, mudsucker.
Get up and get going.
- Sucker...

25:15.846 --> 25:19.264
B.A., get a blanket and cover this guy.
His temperature's really droppin' fast.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.474
Okay, Murdock.

25:23.566 --> 25:27.816
I'm gonna take our little
country cousins on a decoy operation...

25:27.907 --> 25:30.399
lead 'em away from here
as far as I can...

25:30.494 --> 25:32.951
buy some time.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.248
They're used to
huntin' rabbits.

25:35.335 --> 25:39.632
Let's see how they do
with a wolf that bites back.

25:41.637 --> 25:44.842
You see, I have what you call
your nose for news.

25:44.934 --> 25:48.803
That"s why I was there when Big Daddy
Amin pulled off his coup in Uganda.

25:48.898 --> 25:52.234
- I was there when the shah
took his hike from Iran.
- No need to wait here any longer.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.276
[Chuckling] Don't think I was just
looking for a spa in Czechoslovakia...

25:55.367 --> 25:57.824
when the big red machine
came over the border.

25:57.913 --> 25:59.871
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

27:12.489 --> 27:14.779
[Gunshot]

28:13.043 --> 28:14.954
Hold it!

28:27.566 --> 28:29.477
Why, you're a priest!

28:29.570 --> 28:31.563
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry...

28:31.656 --> 28:35.822
but I can"t keep from laughing
whenever I hear that term applied to me.

28:35.913 --> 28:39.248
- You ain't a priest?
- Ah, I don't know what I am.

28:39.335 --> 28:42.836
Why does life have to be so hard
for some of us?

28:42.924 --> 28:45.843
All my life,
I-I've dedicated myself to the Lord...

28:45.929 --> 28:49.382
only to wake up one morning
and discover I have no inner peace...

28:49.476 --> 28:51.684
no tranquillity in my soul...

28:51.771 --> 28:54.525
no... no faith.

28:54.609 --> 28:57.565
Mister, are you all right?
Maybe you oughta sit down.

28:57.656 --> 29:00.029
You're such a sweet soul.

29:00.118 --> 29:04.249
So innocent and... pretty.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.872
Just like... Mary Ann.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.502
- Mary Ann?
- Mmm.

29:09.591 --> 29:12.962
- My name's Louanne.
- Really?

29:13.055 --> 29:16.011
You know, l"ve always been
kind of fascinated with priests...

29:16.102 --> 29:18.060
because they aren't allowed...

29:19.190 --> 29:20.982
I mean, they don't...

29:21.068 --> 29:25.364
Ah, but sometimes... they do.

29:25.450 --> 29:29.450
Oh, no! You and Mary Ann?

29:29.540 --> 29:32.412
Sometimes the runner stumbles.

29:32.503 --> 29:34.793
Oh, Father, I'm truly sorry.

29:34.881 --> 29:36.922
What can I do to help?

29:37.010 --> 29:41.390
Well... would you happen
to have a gasoline engine?

29:41.475 --> 29:43.386
Gasoline engine?

29:43.478 --> 29:45.519
You know, for my power
lawn mower.

29:45.607 --> 29:47.648
You want a power lawn mower?

29:47.735 --> 29:52.364
Well, yes. You see, I feel that if I could
put my garden in order once again...

29:52.451 --> 29:55.573
then it would be akin to putting
my internal house in order...

29:55.664 --> 29:58.501
and I'd have a chance
at another beginning.

29:58.586 --> 30:00.544
Hmm, we don't have
a lawn mower...

30:00.631 --> 30:03.669
- but we do have a power seeding machine.
- Perfect.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.342
This is the seeding machine.
We're not gonna need it till next month.

30:08.435 --> 30:11.390
It's, uh, just what I had in mind.

30:12.399 --> 30:16.399
Actually, all I need to borrow
is the, uh, engine and the wheels.

30:16.489 --> 30:19.445
How you gonna do your plantin'
if you don't take the whole thing?

30:19.536 --> 30:21.446
Oh! Oh, I forgot to tell you.

30:21.539 --> 30:24.031
I have a seeder.
See, I just lack parts.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.701
It would be very selfish to borrow
what I don't really need.

30:26.797 --> 30:30.085
- Waste not, want not.
- Whatever you say.

30:30.177 --> 30:34.676
I know it sounds silly, but,
Louanne, you must... you must understand.

30:34.768 --> 30:37.307
I am a lost sheep...

30:37.397 --> 30:41.148
and you... you've helped me
to find my way.

31:35.573 --> 31:38.112
You can't put the rudder on
before the elevator.

31:38.202 --> 31:40.873
- [B.A.] Man, ain"t nothin" I can"t do.
- Look, I'm the supervisor here.

31:40.956 --> 31:43.663
You ain"t nothin" but a nut
that know how to fly.

31:43.752 --> 31:47.883
You know, B.A., this bickering
is so counterproductive.

31:47.967 --> 31:52.762
I think that now we're out here alone,
just you and me, takin' on the elements,
trying to survive...

31:52.850 --> 31:54.808
- that this would be a good time to...
- [Bird Call]

31:56.397 --> 31:58.972
It's Hannibal.
It's okay, muchacho.

32:02.115 --> 32:04.025
[B.A.]
What took you so long?

32:04.118 --> 32:07.240
I bought us some time,
like I said I would.

32:07.331 --> 32:09.325
This thing is supposed to fly?

32:09.418 --> 32:12.337
I've got no fear. I'll go up
in anything except an elevator.

32:12.423 --> 32:14.251
Where are they?

32:14.342 --> 32:17.096
I left 'em in a canyon
up east of here.

32:17.180 --> 32:19.637
There's more than we thought...
about 20 of them.

32:19.726 --> 32:24.058
B.A., you know those flares
we got aboard the plane?

32:25.068 --> 32:29.863
You think you could put those together
with a... maybe a pipe from
the hydraulic system on the brakes...

32:29.951 --> 32:31.861
and get us some firepower?

32:31.954 --> 32:33.864
Right, right.
No problem, Colonel.

32:33.957 --> 32:37.791
B.A., there's an old saying...
"The best defence is a good offence."

32:37.880 --> 32:39.874
You got that wrong, man.

32:39.966 --> 32:43.302
A good offence
is the best defence.

32:43.389 --> 32:45.596
Okay. Have it your way.

32:45.684 --> 32:48.355
Thanks. Thanks.

32:49.774 --> 32:52.610
- What now?
- I have somebody I have to look in on.

32:52.695 --> 32:55.022
Okay.
Where are we going?

32:55.115 --> 32:57.442
I'll let it be a surprise.

33:02.043 --> 33:04.500
So this is an insane asylum.

33:04.589 --> 33:07.081
I always wanted to do an in-depth
on a bin like this.

33:07.176 --> 33:09.669
I visited one once in Germany...
the Freudian Institute.

33:09.764 --> 33:12.552
Met a guy who thought
he was Douglas Fairbanks.

33:12.643 --> 33:15.729
Shell-shocked.
War's unmerciful to the mind.

33:15.815 --> 33:19.649
- Mitch, I think I should go in alone.
You know what I mean?
- No sweat. I understand.

33:19.738 --> 33:23.191
It's not easy having complete strangers
watch your loved ones
bounce off the walls.

33:23.285 --> 33:27.332
- Hang tough.
I'll be out here if you need me.
- Thanks.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.794
Murdock.

33:39.269 --> 33:41.179
An answering machine.

33:44.944 --> 33:47.698
[Murdock Screams] Hi, y'all.
Howling Mad here in voice only.

33:47.782 --> 33:49.693
This time my body has split,
along with my mind.

33:49.785 --> 33:53.868
So at the tone, leave your name
and the message, and I'll get back to you
as soon as my shock therapy's over. Bye.

33:59.175 --> 34:02.178
What are you doing inside?
You want her to spot us here together?

34:02.264 --> 34:05.634
Not that it matters much.
I don't think she has anything
to do with this A-Team any more.

34:05.727 --> 34:09.726
- Wrong. Then what is she doing here
checking in with H.M. Murdock?
- It's in her files.

34:09.817 --> 34:13.603
She's remained friendly with him
ever since a while ago when she
tried to contact the A-Team.

34:13.697 --> 34:17.034
Look, she's a good kid.
She just probably feels bad for the guy.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.031
Look, she...

34:25.175 --> 34:28.295
Great!
Now we've lost our bird dog.

34:28.388 --> 34:31.724
Wrong. The tailing device
is still in the car.

34:35.024 --> 34:36.934
And working.

34:39.822 --> 34:41.983
This thing is never gonna work.

34:42.077 --> 34:45.245
[Panting] Hey, you want to
give me a hand here?

34:45.331 --> 34:47.705
Pays to stay fit.

34:47.793 --> 34:49.918
So you found us a wheel
and a motor.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.248
[Loud Grunt]
That's right.

34:52.342 --> 34:55.594
Not a five-horse,
not a seven-and-a-half horse...

34:55.681 --> 34:59.349
but a 10-horse, air-cooled
gasoline motor, as ordered.

34:59.437 --> 35:02.310
[Murdock] Face, I don"t know
how you do it, but you sure do it good.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.691
Well, look, you give me
a job to do, I do it.

35:04.779 --> 35:08.447
I pool my resources, I consider
my options and then I go for it.

35:08.535 --> 35:11.206
Sure, it's not easy.
There are risks, but I take 'em.

35:11.290 --> 35:14.126
- What was her name?
- Louanne.

35:16.131 --> 35:19.667
- [Gasps]
- That preacher was workin'
with them city boys.

35:19.761 --> 35:23.132
- He helped them steal our prisoner.
- No!

35:23.225 --> 35:27.806
He said he was plantin"a garden
and that he needed parts for his seeder.

35:27.899 --> 35:31.235
He said that he was
becomin' a lost sheep.

35:31.321 --> 35:34.657
- All right. We're goin'.
- Where?

35:36.496 --> 35:39.167
To help the reverend find God.

35:47.514 --> 35:50.600
Red Carpet Flight 86
now ready for boarding.

35:50.685 --> 35:53.771
All passengers holding tickets
will now be on board.

35:53.857 --> 35:56.350
You got some structural weakness
in the wing struts...

35:56.444 --> 35:58.735
and they won't hold if you start
any of your aerobatics.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.609
Remember, keep an eye on the silks.
If it starts to shred, take it down.

36:02.704 --> 36:06.455
I didn't know you cared, sweetheart.

36:06.544 --> 36:08.454
Thanks, B.A.

36:08.547 --> 36:11.218
Don't thank me.

36:11.301 --> 36:13.591
Just keep it out of the trees.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.098
Get this bird off the ground.
That guy's sweatin' bullets.

36:17.186 --> 36:20.853
[Mock German Accent]
I will find civilization, muchacho!

36:20.942 --> 36:25.357
I will bring back reinforcements!
What on earth will you be doing
while I'm gone?

36:25.449 --> 36:28.950
Just guess, Murdock.
Just guess.

36:30.540 --> 36:33.709
[Engine Revving]

36:40.973 --> 36:45.389
## [Singing In Mock German]

36:48.986 --> 36:52.487
Oops!
## [Continues]

37:00.880 --> 37:04.500
- ## [Continues]
- Beautiful!

37:13.984 --> 37:16.393
That man is crazy.

37:16.488 --> 37:19.407
Yeah, but it's
a good kind of crazy.

37:20.411 --> 37:24.363
Whoo-hoo!
We are flying!

37:24.459 --> 37:29.088
- # Someday the birds will come to me #
- [Ripping]

37:29.842 --> 37:33.095
# Someday the birds
will say I'm free #

37:34.266 --> 37:38.681
# Someday the birds
will sing my song #

37:38.773 --> 37:42.904
# Someday the birds
will come along ##

38:38.618 --> 38:42.285
## [Singing In Mock German]

38:56.229 --> 38:58.473
You're gonna be okay, Pop.

38:58.566 --> 39:01.854
We're gonna get you there
in no time.

39:03.741 --> 39:08.073
- [Silk Ripping]
- Uh, hang on, Lucy. I'm comin' around.

39:08.165 --> 39:11.417
I know you're only pretending
to have your eyes shut!

39:11.504 --> 39:14.340
But it doesn't matter anyway
'cause it's gonna be a rough landing.

39:14.425 --> 39:17.511
Keep your arms in
and don't put your feet over the side.

39:17.597 --> 39:19.637
I think I see the landing strip.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.849
[Engine Droning]

39:21.937 --> 39:23.681
There it is!

39:23.773 --> 39:25.850
I think we"re gonna come in safely.

39:25.943 --> 39:29.361
Just hold your breath, Pop.
We're on our way down.

39:29.449 --> 39:34.410
And with a...
[Mock German]

39:34.498 --> 39:39.412
we are gonna manipulate this son of a gun
into the correct position.

39:39.506 --> 39:43.008
Tighten your seat belts!
Secure your trays!

39:43.095 --> 39:46.264
Blah, blah, blah!
I am coming down!

39:46.350 --> 39:48.973
Oops!
Pay no attention to that rip!

39:49.063 --> 39:52.066
Air goes through that
like water through my nose!

39:52.151 --> 39:55.071
We are just 20 feet, Pop!
Twenty feet!

39:55.156 --> 39:59.488
And we have... landed!

40:01.499 --> 40:04.419
Whoo! Phew.

40:07.300 --> 40:10.968
Help me! Help me! I got a sick man here!
I gotta get him to the hospital!

40:11.056 --> 40:13.810
There's a hospital about a mile and a half
down the road in Fulton.

40:13.894 --> 40:17.063
Best way is to put him in my
four-wheel drive and take him on down.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.060
What the heck happened
to him anyway?

40:19.152 --> 40:22.606
You've got some guys with white eyeballs
living on the other side of that ridge!

40:22.700 --> 40:24.694
I've seen some crazy guys
in my time.

40:24.786 --> 40:27.991
I've been in a whole ward full of them,
but I've never seen anybody like those.

40:28.083 --> 40:31.834
- They did that to him?
- Well, it wasn't a grey,
furry squirrel with a shotgun!

40:31.923 --> 40:34.380
Now get! Get!
Before he croaks!

40:34.468 --> 40:37.139
- I'm on my way.
- [Tyres Squealing]

40:38.224 --> 40:40.218
[Mock English Accent]
By the way...

40:40.311 --> 40:43.314
would you mind awfully
if I borrowed your shiny little chopper?

40:43.399 --> 40:47.696
[American Accent]
Absolutely not! No problem, pal.

40:47.781 --> 40:51.235
[English Accent]
Well, that's very kind of you.
I'll certainly take good care of it.

40:51.328 --> 40:54.664
You Americans certainly know
how to take care of your friends
from across the sea.

40:54.751 --> 40:57.587
[American Accent]
Have you had dinner yet, by the way, pal?
Maybe we could get together...

41:04.850 --> 41:07.853
All right.
Now we know where they is.

41:07.938 --> 41:10.561
There's that plane crashed up yonder
in the holler...

41:10.651 --> 41:12.977
the one Zeb saw from the hills.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.860
We're gonna spread out
and come in on 'em from all sides.

41:15.951 --> 41:18.158
There he is!
Let"s get him!

41:18.246 --> 41:21.783
Get him! Kill him!
Get to the cars.

42:13.834 --> 42:15.994
[Hannibal]
Now, Face!

42:27.147 --> 42:30.399
[Men Shouting]

42:33.699 --> 42:35.740
[Hannibal]
Now, B.A.!

42:55.358 --> 42:57.648
I've had enough of this.
Let's get out of here.

43:22.276 --> 43:24.151
Ain't nobody around here.

43:24.237 --> 43:28.783
We'll just close off this valley.
We'll find them sooner or later.

43:28.870 --> 43:30.994
[Helicopter Blades Whirring]

43:48.735 --> 43:51.192
Whaa!

43:53.367 --> 43:55.694
Drop 'em!

43:55.787 --> 43:57.781
Do it now!

43:59.710 --> 44:03.841
Or the next one
won"t be over your heads!

44:03.925 --> 44:06.679
Everybody in the aeroplane!

44:16.487 --> 44:20.107
Now, close that door!

44:20.201 --> 44:22.824
Anybody sticks their head out...

44:22.914 --> 44:24.872
Ioses everything!

44:26.378 --> 44:29.214
- How come you put 'em in there?
- Because I'm out of ammunition.

44:30.801 --> 44:33.294
[Murdock] The guy they tried to kill
is with the road department.

44:33.389 --> 44:35.881
We'll hold these fellas down
till you can come out and arrest them.

44:35.976 --> 44:39.976
Don't you love it? They're in there
worried we're gonna kill 'em.

44:40.066 --> 44:42.641
And we're out here with no ammo.

44:42.737 --> 44:46.190
Hannibal, sometimes I think
you're crazier than Murdock.

44:46.284 --> 44:49.987
[Laughs]
Sometimes I am.

45:20.505 --> 45:24.457
All right, that must be it.

45:25.722 --> 45:29.140
Come on. Let's go. Inside.
Come on!

45:48.967 --> 45:52.753
[Man On P.A.] Will Colonel Lynch please
check at the reservation desk, please?

45:52.848 --> 45:57.097
- Colonel Lynch, please check
at the reservation desk.
- M.P.s.

46:02.613 --> 46:05.652
[Driver] Hey, man. In or out.
I gotta take this bus in to be cleaned.

46:22.270 --> 46:25.937
Amy must have paged Lynch
to warn us. Good girl.

46:26.026 --> 46:28.518
I wonder how long
they been following her.

46:28.613 --> 46:31.284
Well, if it was since this morning
and if we'd been on schedule...

46:31.367 --> 46:34.074
we'd have landed right
in Lynch's military lap.

46:34.163 --> 46:36.952
- That means we're
pretty lucky we crashed!
- Ohh!

46:37.043 --> 46:40.046
I love it when a plan
comes together.
