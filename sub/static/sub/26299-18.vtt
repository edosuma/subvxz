in every moment,

in every person,

Good news.
[ Burps ]

16:23.016 --> 16:24.484
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.786
I, uh -- I just
slipped the guy $20

16:26.819 --> 16:28.155
so that we could ride
the mechanical bull together.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.623
Okay, which guy?
Because that's a plastic cow,

to tell you which is the front.

Hey, listen,
it's starting to slow down.

get going, huh?
Really?

Night's just
gettin' started.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.469
I'll get us a car.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.570
Why are you
in such a rush

16:43.603 --> 16:45.338
to get us out of here?

16:45.372 --> 16:46.406
Is it about me?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.875
No!

It's about
your clothes

and your --

You're embarrassed
of me.

who's been asking me

16:57.684 --> 16:58.818
to come here
for years.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.887
I really thought I wanted
you here, but then,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.155
once you came here,

17:02.189 --> 17:04.757
I discovered that I don't
really want you here.

[ Sighs ]
Wow, that is beyond --

17:06.559 --> 17:07.560
Okay, well,
let me ask you.

Did you have
a good time tonight?

Okay, answer
the question.
No.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.102
No, the floor's sticky,
I don't know a single song,

17:15.135 --> 17:16.836
and I'm not entirely sure

17:16.868 --> 17:18.204
Donna isn't
your sister, Pam.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.740
Honey, I appreciate that
you went to all this trouble,

17:20.772 --> 17:21.840
but you know what?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.176
Maybe we don't have to do
everything together.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.944
Maybe that's how
we'll make sure

17:25.978 --> 17:28.214
we have lots
of anniversaries.
Oh.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.683
And I promise
never to forget again.

And I promise I'll never count
down the seconds to shame you.

Okay, let's get you
out of that belt buckle.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.558
Ooh.
No, I didn't mean it
in a sexy way.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.726
It's hideous.
It looks like something

17:39.759 --> 17:41.794
you'd get
off CalShopTV.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.297
Um, can you call me a driver
for the ride home?

Uh, talk loud.

your dog beds?

Beds by Stella.

she's your inspiration

What kind of dog
is she?

French bulldog.
And I know what you're thinking.

so she has an attitude.

of the Earth.

when I sit her next to me

sports.

You know, I explain
the whole game to her,

19:50.357 --> 19:52.392

because, you know, um,

understand sports.

it's very annoying

that live with you.
