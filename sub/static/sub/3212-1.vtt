You passed out,
you wet your underpants.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.631
I thought you were dying.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.500
I did not wet my
underpants, okay?

20:02.502 --> 20:04.335
They're... Oh,
they're wet. Ew!

20:04.337 --> 20:06.003
Super wet. But that was

20:06.005 --> 20:08.506
from something else before.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.874
I-I was-was, uh,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.976
swimming the front,
the... the front side.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.011
Okay, I just thought
that you were in trouble...
Well, you thought wrong!

20:14.013 --> 20:15.880
That was from something
else before, I told you!

20:15.882 --> 20:18.082
I'm not accusing you...
I'm not saying
you're accusing me!

20:18.084 --> 20:20.685
I'm telling you they
were wet before, okay?
Okay, okay! Oh, gosh!

20:20.687 --> 20:22.520
Okay, back up! Back up!
Okay, whoa, whoa,

20:22.522 --> 20:24.222
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:25.491 --> 20:27.592
Okay, okay.
Drop my bra.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.393
Okay, okay, okay.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.695
No!

20:30.697 --> 20:32.230
Drop it!

20:33.732 --> 20:35.666
Gross.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.735
Are you nice?
What?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.837
Are you a nice person?!

20:39.839 --> 20:41.172
Okay, yes, yes!
I'm really nice!

20:41.174 --> 20:42.573
I'm very, very, very nice!

20:42.575 --> 20:44.342
I'm so nice, seriously.
I promise you.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.510
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.846
Nothing of which to be afraid.
But I just said that.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.414
You can't end sentences
with prepositions!

20:50.416 --> 20:52.450
"Nothing of which to be afraid"
is the proper grammar!

20:52.452 --> 20:53.584
Fine, yes, okay.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.219
There's nothing of which...
Yes.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.420
Huh?

20:56.422 --> 20:57.555
That's better.
Good with that?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.690
Of which to be afraid, okay?

20:59.692 --> 21:00.791
Mm-hmm.
Huh?

21:00.793 --> 21:02.293
You can trust me,
seriously.

21:02.295 --> 21:05.630
Honestly? I did
wet my underpants.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.865
They were totally dry
before I soaked them.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.034
I soaked them.
Why did you lie to me?

21:10.036 --> 21:12.270
'Cause I'm an adult and
I wet my underpants.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.605
Are you the one who put up all
those "Alive in Tucson" signs?

21:14.607 --> 21:16.741
Yes! Yes! That was me.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.476
That was me.
I did that. Look.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.211
I am so sorry.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.747
I haven't seen another human
being in, like, two years.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.048
And I was literally

21:24.050 --> 21:25.750
about to kill myself
five minutes ago.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.151
I'm harmless, okay?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.153
Why don't you put
that gun away?

21:29.155 --> 21:30.655
What do you need
that gun out for?

21:30.657 --> 21:32.590
Don't you mean "Out for what
do you need that gun"?

21:32.592 --> 21:33.824
Okay, that can't be right.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.393
It is.
No, come on.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.962
No, no, no! You don't
have to cock that thing!

21:37.964 --> 21:39.297
Fine. Look.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.499
Out for what do
you need that gun?

21:41.501 --> 21:42.967
Huh?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.468
Come on.

21:45.437 --> 21:47.338
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.941
Why don't you put
that thing away?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.009
There you go.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.678
I'm a quick draw.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.346
So watch yourself.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.982
Thank you, thank you.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.483

22:26.312 --> 22:28.446
You wouldn't think Florida
for radishes,

22:28.448 --> 22:29.814
but they are absolutely
chockablock.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.649

22:31.651 --> 22:32.983
just walk five feet.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.665

23:01.013 --> 23:02.346
I was a temp.

23:02.348 --> 23:04.348
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:04.350 --> 23:05.583

23:13.259 --> 23:15.693
You mean not something
of which you are super-proud.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.727
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.828
Were you an
English teacher?

23:17.830 --> 23:20.097
No, I was an office manager

23:20.099 --> 23:22.099
at a hot sauce
bottling company.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.336
Sounds like a spicy job.

23:25.338 --> 23:27.405
No, it... I didn't work
with the spices.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.773
I was filing.

23:29.775 --> 23:30.841

23:30.843 --> 23:32.276

23:32.278 --> 23:33.344

23:33.346 --> 23:34.412
Oh, whoa, whoa.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.413
(makes clinking noise)

23:35.415 --> 23:37.014
I want to protect the ceramic.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.383
Noted.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.218
And you have to make eye
contact, or it won't come true.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.753
Oh, okay.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.121
Well, let's
try it again.
Okay.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.122
Cheers.
Cheers.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.557
(makes clinking noise)

23:46.559 --> 23:47.958
(laughs)

24:03.542 --> 24:04.809
Uh, oh.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.477
That was a stop sign.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.812
Y-Yeah, it was.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.146
You just went
right through it.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.382
Uh, y-yes, I did.

24:11.384 --> 24:14.718
Well, could you do me a flavor
and stop at the next one?

24:14.720 --> 24:17.655
Carol, stop signs are
there to mediate traffic.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.224
And traffic doesn't
exist anymore,

24:20.226 --> 24:22.159
so essentially stop
signs don't either.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.661
Yeah, except that they do.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.262
And I'd rather
you stopped at them.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.464
Oh, here's one.
Here's one.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.598
Here's one.
Okay, okay,
okay.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.999
Stopping.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.604
Looking both ways.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.306
And moving on.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.340
<i> Here we go.</i>

24:36.342 --> 24:38.275
<i> I'm gonna ease into it.</i>

24:38.277 --> 24:39.276
Feel better?

24:39.278 --> 24:40.277
Thank you, Phil.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.912
Yeah.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.948
I can't wait
to see your house.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.418
They say a person's home
is a reflection of their soul.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.620
So this is my toilet pool.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.855
Mmm.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.525
And here's my garbage pool.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.694
And, uh, this is
my margarita pool.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.163
CAROL:
You swim in that?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.532
Well, I swim in it,
I drink out of it.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.968
There's really no wrong way
to use a margarita pool,

25:03.970 --> 25:05.870
you know what I mean?

25:06.972 --> 25:09.874
Work your way through here.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.443
Sorry, it's kind of
messy right now.

25:12.445 --> 25:15.012
What a collection of cans.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.115
Oh, where'd you get
all these paintings?

25:18.117 --> 25:19.650
You know, I took
them from, uh...

25:19.652 --> 25:21.318
various museums.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.355
I got some van Goghs
and Monets.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.723
In that pile alone,
there's, like,

25:25.725 --> 25:27.525
a billion dollars worth
of famous paintings.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.127
So you stole all
these paintings?

25:30.129 --> 25:32.129
What? No. No.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.632
Plus, I take very good
care of this stuff... Oh, shoot.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.968
Uh, I'd better
dry this baby off.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.336
There we go.

25:39.338 --> 25:40.671
Dry as new.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.906
Sorry, Rembrandt.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.240
Phil, what are these?

25:43.242 --> 25:44.508
Uh...

25:44.510 --> 25:47.845
And those and those and that?

25:47.847 --> 25:50.514
They are... magazines.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.716
Oh. What kind of magazines?

25:52.718 --> 25:54.985
Well, they are...

25:54.987 --> 25:57.555
masturbatory magazines.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.224
Okay. Okay.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.258
What?

26:01.260 --> 26:03.160
Is there, uh...
something wrong?

26:03.162 --> 26:06.997
You know, I'm just trying not
to judge the book by its cover.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.833
And-and what book
are you referring to, Carol?

26:09.835 --> 26:12.169
The book<i> to which </i>
I'm referring

26:12.171 --> 26:13.904
is called Phil Miller.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.706
Sounds like a good book.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.042
It's the story of a man
with a brothel of a home

26:18.044 --> 26:19.777
and a pool filled
with human excrement.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.745
Carol, there is
no running water.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.547
Did you ever
try to fix that?

26:23.549 --> 26:26.016
I did fix it.
With a toilet pool.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.284
Mmm.
You probably
would have done

26:27.286 --> 26:28.452
the exact same thing.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.187
Oh, no, I know that
I wouldn't have.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.622
Because I'm not
an animal.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.123
Oh, so I'm an animal now?

26:33.125 --> 26:34.124
Okay, thank you.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.392
I'm just saying

26:35.394 --> 26:38.062
that if you diverted
a small percentage

26:38.064 --> 26:39.363
of your
masturbation energy

26:39.365 --> 26:41.298
towards fixing
the water problem,

26:41.300 --> 26:45.035
you might be going potty
in a toilet right now.

26:45.037 --> 26:48.305
Maybe we should get you
back to that campsite.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.946
Look, I know you've been
through a hard time--

26:55.948 --> 26:57.815
we both have--

26:57.817 --> 26:59.984
but I'm gonna help you get
your life back together.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.286
Well, I am looking forward
to that.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.654
Good first day.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.222
Great first day.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.157
See you tomorr...
(tires screeching)

27:11.896 --> 27:13.297
(cans clattering)

27:15.233 --> 27:16.634
Carol?

27:16.636 --> 27:17.768
What are you
doing in here?

27:17.770 --> 27:18.769
Good morning!

27:18.771 --> 27:20.571
Remember how I said

27:20.573 --> 27:22.640
your home was a reflection
of your soul?

27:22.642 --> 27:24.842
Well, I'm cleaning up your soul.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.244
Well, uh, next time
you want to clean up my soul,

27:27.246 --> 27:28.512
could you please give me

27:28.514 --> 27:29.847
a little advanced
notice beforehand?

27:29.849 --> 27:31.482
Of course.
Yeah.

27:31.484 --> 27:33.117
Sorry.
Okay.
(laughs)

27:33.119 --> 27:35.919
Uh, here, I'll just put it
back the way you had it.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.254
That'd be great.

27:38.089 --> 27:39.089
Whoa, whoa, wait!

27:39.091 --> 27:40.124
Now, no, no, no!

27:40.126 --> 27:41.925
Be gentle!
Carol, Carol!

27:41.927 --> 27:43.594
Watch out for my
Jenga tower, okay?

27:43.596 --> 27:45.262
I spent a lot
of time on that.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.432
Oh, and you think
that's time well spent, Phil?

27:49.934 --> 27:51.035
Yes, I do.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.369
Phil, you can't just be playing

27:52.371 --> 27:53.804
with your Yenga all day.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.773
We have work to do.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.676
I need gardening supplies,
you need cleaning supplies.

27:58.678 --> 27:59.877
We're going to the store.

27:59.879 --> 28:02.713
No, we're n...

28:07.719 --> 28:10.020
CAROL:
<i> Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?</i>

28:10.022 --> 28:11.055
PHIL:
<i> What now?</i>

28:11.057 --> 28:12.322
(Carol scoffs)

28:12.324 --> 28:13.857
This is a handicapped
parking spot.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.192
Okay, Carol.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.994
We're the last two
people on Earth.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.996
If by some tiny chance

28:18.998 --> 28:21.965
a handicapped person happens
to be driving through Tucson

28:21.967 --> 28:24.134
and makes a beeline for
this hardware store,

28:24.136 --> 28:25.502
they can park
right over there,

28:25.504 --> 28:27.538
which is even closer
to the store.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.073
That's not a parking spot.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.474
That is a spot, Carol!

28:30.476 --> 28:31.642
No, it's not a spot.

28:31.644 --> 28:32.976
And that is a
parking spot...

28:32.978 --> 28:34.645
No.
...and that is a
parking spot.

28:34.647 --> 28:36.046
Look all around you.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.482
Everything you see right
now is a parking spot.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.750
You're a parking spot.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.085
Yes, I am!

28:41.087 --> 28:42.553
Now you're getting it.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.589
The whole freaking world
is a parking spot now.

28:45.591 --> 28:48.025
It's one of the only
benefits of our situation.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.326
In fact, you know what?

28:49.328 --> 28:50.928
I want to park a
little closer...

28:50.930 --> 28:52.696
I want to park
a little closer.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.865
CAROL:
<i> What are you doing?</i>

28:54.867 --> 28:57.267
PHIL:
<i> Getting a closer parking spot.</i>

29:06.444 --> 29:08.345
This spot feels
right to me.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.913
This feels good.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.384
So that's it, huh?

29:14.386 --> 29:16.587
You don't care about rules
or laws anymore?

29:16.589 --> 29:17.921
What's next?

29:17.923 --> 29:19.256
You gonna burn down
a church?

29:19.258 --> 29:21.525
Carol, I would never
burn down a church.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.927
Why?
It's a church!

29:23.929 --> 29:27.765
And this is a store, and that
is a handicapped parking spot!

29:29.567 --> 29:31.602
Fine.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.112
PHIL:
<i> So, uh, guess who's not the</i>
<i> last person on Earth anymore.</i>

29:42.114 --> 29:44.381
It should be the best day
of my life, right?

29:44.383 --> 29:46.550
I mean, you guys know
how horny I've been.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.218
Just so, so, so, so, so horny.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.220
Just next-level horny.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.089
But this woman is just a turd.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.391
Eight ball, corner pocket.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.326
Maybe I'm being too harsh.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.828
At times
she's almost kind of cute.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.297
Then she opens her mouth,
and it just sucks.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.099
What a turd.
Eight ball, corner pocket.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.500
Ugh!

30:03.502 --> 30:05.669
"Ooh, I want to fix you, Phil."

30:05.671 --> 30:07.271
That's what she said to me.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.739
I'm a work in progress, sure,

30:08.741 --> 30:10.140
but I've progressed
to the point where it's...

30:10.142 --> 30:11.842
I'm very close, I'm very close.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.977
Eight ball, corner pocket.
(groans)

30:13.979 --> 30:15.813
Bottom line, and I can't
believe I'm saying this,

30:15.815 --> 30:18.015
I think I need a little space.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.691
(gargles)

30:33.598 --> 30:36.333
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

30:36.335 --> 30:37.968
No, no, no, no, no!

30:37.970 --> 30:39.803
No, no, no, no
no, no, no, no.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.438
No, no, no, no.
Carol, Carol.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.506
Carol, Carol, Carol?

30:42.508 --> 30:43.707
Yeah.
What are you doing?

30:43.709 --> 30:45.142
Huh?
I'm moving in
next door.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.610
Carol...
Yeah.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.111
...there are, no
exaggeration,

30:48.113 --> 30:49.947
all the houses in the
world to choose from.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.683
Okay, why does it have to be the
house right next door to mine?

30:52.685 --> 30:54.384
What's wrong?

30:54.386 --> 30:56.220
Do you do weird stuff
in your house

30:56.222 --> 30:57.721
that you don't want me to see?

30:57.723 --> 30:59.456
I... No, I do not
do weird stuff.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.958
I do normal stuff.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.126
But I'd like to do that
normal stuff in private.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.795
Are you afraid
I'm gonna see you naked?

31:04.797 --> 31:06.563
(chuckles)

31:08.233 --> 31:09.666
Does this answer
your question?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.835
Do you want me
to look at it? Hello.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.303
No! No, Carol.
What do you say, little guy?

31:13.305 --> 31:15.138
Is this what you want?
I'm looking right at it.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.373
Carol, stop this.
Ooh.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.307
Don't be scared.
Come on, Carol.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.243
Carol.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.878
Look, I'll choose
a different house,

31:20.880 --> 31:22.579
but I'm staying
in this neighborhood.

31:24.349 --> 31:26.650
All right.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.353
How much longer are we gonna
dance around this?

31:29.355 --> 31:31.421
Dance around what?

31:31.423 --> 31:33.824
The reason we both
survived-- our purpose.

31:33.826 --> 31:35.659
We were chosen.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.028
W-Would you just say what
you're trying to say?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.930
Repopulation, you dumb donkey!

31:39.932 --> 31:41.899
Something we have to do!

31:41.901 --> 31:43.333
Together!

31:43.335 --> 31:46.203
Carol, no
disrespect here,

31:46.205 --> 31:48.672
but have you ever
heard the phrase,

31:48.674 --> 31:50.007
"I wouldn't have
sex with you

31:50.009 --> 31:51.541
if you were the last
person on Earth"?

31:51.543 --> 31:54.211
You think I want
to repopulate with you?

31:54.213 --> 31:57.347
Oh, I would rather
eat a cat.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.082
And I love cats.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.351
(voice breaking):
And the thought of killing a cat

32:01.353 --> 32:03.887
and then eating
its little furry body,

32:03.889 --> 32:06.623
like, that's how I feel
about making love to you.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.258
So we're done here, then?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.960
Oh, not by a long shot.

32:11.195 --> 32:13.730
The fate of the human race
is depending on us.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.867
You may hide behind that
rat's nest of a beard of yours

32:16.869 --> 32:18.936
and pretend that you don't
care about anything,

32:18.938 --> 32:21.538
but I know that deep down
inside of you,

32:21.540 --> 32:24.908
there is a nice-smelling person
who actually gives a hoot,

32:24.910 --> 32:27.244
and I am not giving up
until I find him!

32:27.246 --> 32:30.514
Well, good luck
with that, Carol.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.151
I'm gonna find him!

32:34.153 --> 32:36.420
You're a great
guy, Phil!

32:36.422 --> 32:39.122
Somewhere in there!

32:39.124 --> 32:40.424
Hidden.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.059
Far away.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.733
Hi, Phil.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.134
Carol!

32:51.136 --> 32:53.103
Geez! Can I get a
little privacy here?!

32:53.105 --> 32:55.906
Oh, definitely-- if you used
your inside toilet.

32:55.908 --> 32:58.241
What part of "no running
water" do you not understand?

32:58.243 --> 32:59.743
All of it.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.345
(chuckles): I mean, look at
what you're doing, Phil.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.981
Carol, this
works for me.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.650
The fact that it doesn't work
for you is not my problem.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.152
I just want to live
like a human being again.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.654
I want to take a shower.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.155
I want to water my garden.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.124
I want our kids to have
fresh fruits and vegetables.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.025
Our kids?!

33:15.027 --> 33:16.593
Yes.
Carol,

33:16.595 --> 33:19.262
I am definitely not
having kids with you.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.665
Fine,<i> I</i> want fresh fruits
and vegetables.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.933
Don't you want that?

33:22.935 --> 33:24.968
I honestly don't care.

33:24.970 --> 33:27.270

33:34.480 --> 33:36.346

33:36.348 --> 33:37.814
Phil, some people say
"to-mah-to."

33:37.816 --> 33:38.849
I'm one of those people.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.784
Of course you are.

Oh, I'm definitely out.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.027
I was never even close
to being in.

don't eat.

(knocking)

38:51.162 --> 38:52.495
Carol.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.496
Hello, Phil.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.131
How's the foot?
Not great.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.200
How's the toilet fountain?
Full.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.702
Ah, geez, Carol.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.370
Could you come with me
for a minute?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.714
You know anything
about this?

39:10.716 --> 39:12.482
Nope.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.683
Can't help you.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.218
Really?

39:15.220 --> 39:17.654
No. Carol, I mean,
look at this thing.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.356
Whoever did this
would've had to

39:19.358 --> 39:20.690
stay up all night

39:20.692 --> 39:22.492
and go research
water systems at a library

39:22.494 --> 39:24.327
and then put
all this stuff together.

39:24.329 --> 39:26.996
Do I look like somebody who
could do something like that?

39:26.998 --> 39:29.366
Y-You're right.
Couldn't have been you.

39:32.169 --> 39:35.205
Hey. You want to come over
for dinner tonight?

39:38.342 --> 39:40.377
Yeah. I'd like that.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.545
Okay.

39:42.547 --> 39:45.548
Well, see you.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.586
Hey, uh, Carol?

39:50.421 --> 39:52.689
You know I did this, right?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.991
Yeah, I know, Phil.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.560
It was... a lot of work
and it took all night

39:57.562 --> 40:00.430
and I had to go to a library
and read a bunch of crap.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.932
Yeah, it's very, very obvious
it was you who did it.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.534
Feels good, I'll admit.

40:04.536 --> 40:07.470
It feels good to be so selfless.

40:08.539 --> 40:10.039
Anyway, we can talk
more about it

40:10.041 --> 40:11.741
at dinner.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.777
Okay.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.445
I have a feeling
we're gonna remember

40:15.447 --> 40:17.514
what I did here today
for a long time.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.416
And that's cool.

40:29.860 --> 40:33.563
There's a fork, if...
if you need it.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.131
Oh.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.966
I'm good.

40:38.035 --> 40:39.936
This is really nice.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.337
Mmm, I know.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.741
You showed a lot
of chutzpah today, Phil.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.242
And it made me

40:46.244 --> 40:50.113
think that maybe God does
want us to lay together.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.051
Okay.
Oh.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.386
I've been really horny, so...

40:56.388 --> 40:58.822
Well, that's nice.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.791
I should probably go
wash my balls first.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.126
Mmm!
Meet you back
here in five?

41:03.128 --> 41:04.594
Want to knock
it out?
(laughs)

41:04.596 --> 41:05.795
No.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.464
Wait, I don't...
What do you mean?

41:07.466 --> 41:09.766
I'm not gonna have sex with you
unless we're married.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.469
(laughing)

41:12.471 --> 41:14.437
Oh, it's nice to see you smile.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.940
That is your first
really good joke.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.074
That's very funny.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.809
Phil, I'm not kidding.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.312
We have to be married first.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.680
You're serious.

41:23.682 --> 41:24.948
Yes.
Oh.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.115
Then, no.

41:26.117 --> 41:26.983
Phil, we can't...

41:26.985 --> 41:28.117
Absolute no.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.285
Why not?

41:29.287 --> 41:30.854
Wh... what do you mean,
"Why not?"

41:30.856 --> 41:32.622
Why?

41:32.624 --> 41:34.324
The first child of this new
world is not gonna be a bastard.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.025
Yeah, 'cause it's not
gonna exist,

41:36.027 --> 41:37.327
'cause I'm not gonna marry you.

41:37.329 --> 41:38.995
Then you're the bastard.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.196
Fine, I'm the bastard.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.431
And good-bye human race.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.266
(chuckles)
Thank you for dinner.

41:43.268 --> 41:46.202
I am going to go
back to my house...

41:46.204 --> 41:47.370
Right.

41:47.372 --> 41:49.172
...think about how
crazy you are.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.473
Okay.

41:50.475 --> 41:51.941
Enjoy those...
You are being serious?!

41:51.943 --> 41:53.009
Yes.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.611
Why do you have to be married?

41:54.613 --> 41:57.180
It-it doesn't mean anything
anymore.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.681
It means something to me, Phil.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.650
Well, it doesn't mean
anything to me.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.352
Then why do you care?

42:11.695 --> 42:14.364
PHIL:
What is happening here?!

42:14.366 --> 42:18.301
It's tomato! It's tomato!

42:27.378 --> 42:29.245
Oh, hi.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.415
Fine.

42:32.417 --> 42:33.983
We're married.

42:33.985 --> 42:37.353
Phil, get down on one knee
and do it properly.

42:37.355 --> 42:39.389
This is so stupid.

42:39.391 --> 42:41.057
Can you do it over here?
Carol...

42:41.059 --> 42:42.191
Well, do it...
We...

42:42.193 --> 42:43.660
Get it over here...
over here...

42:43.662 --> 42:45.228
No! This is where
the proposal is happening.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.064
Okay.
You want it, you come
over here and get it.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.098
Okay.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.167
Carol...
what's your middle name?

42:51.169 --> 42:51.935
Andrew.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.102
Andrew?
Yeah.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.604
What is that,
a family name?

42:54.606 --> 42:55.939
No.

42:58.075 --> 43:01.110
Carol... Andrew Pilbasian...

43:01.946 --> 43:03.179
...will you marry me?

43:03.181 --> 43:04.714
Yes!

43:04.716 --> 43:06.382
Yes, I will!

43:06.384 --> 43:07.717
Yes, I will!
You will?

43:07.719 --> 43:10.019
Yes!
Oh!

43:10.021 --> 43:11.888
Did you... have any doubt?

43:11.890 --> 43:13.423
I was so nervous.
(laughing)

43:13.425 --> 43:15.558
Oh!

43:15.560 --> 43:16.793
Yay!

43:16.795 --> 43:19.062
We're getting married!
Yay!
Yeah.
