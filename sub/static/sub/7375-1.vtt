00:35.746 --> 00:37.475
Woman's voice:
Hello, my name is Goody,

00:37.514 --> 00:41.177
and in 1841, I was bitten
by a stem vampire.

00:41.218 --> 00:43.686
A stem is able to awaken
the victims

00:43.720 --> 00:45.347
they choose not to drain.

00:45.389 --> 00:47.050
Normally, this would be
one of those tales

00:47.090 --> 00:49.354
of gore and homicidal urges,

00:49.393 --> 00:51.293
but I've always looked
on the bright side.

00:51.328 --> 00:53.125
So I learned to live
on animal blood.

00:53.163 --> 00:54.528
And having eternal life

00:54.565 --> 00:57.398
gave me extra years
with my loved ones.

00:57.434 --> 00:59.732
Nighttime used to be
dull and dark,

00:59.770 --> 01:02.068
but things got a lot better
in the '80s.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.471
Oh, the 1880s, that is.

01:04.507 --> 01:07.033
The Industrial Revolution
gave us electricity

01:07.077 --> 01:08.567
and light bulbs.

01:08.612 --> 01:11.172
And suddenly, nights were
as bright as daytime.

01:11.214 --> 01:12.772
Telephones replaced letters,

01:12.816 --> 01:15.114
and the new subways let
you travel the whole city

01:15.152 --> 01:17.677
and still be in your coffin
by sunrise.

01:17.721 --> 01:20.849
In the 1920s,
things really turned modern.

01:20.891 --> 01:22.688
Skirts got shorter,

01:22.726 --> 01:25.889
jazz babies and flappers
owned the night.

01:25.929 --> 01:27.419
The world belonged
to the young,

01:27.464 --> 01:29.591
and I was an expert
at being young.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.464
And then came
my favorite invention...

01:31.501 --> 01:32.798
flickers.

01:32.836 --> 01:35.464
Chaplin, Keaton,
Cagney...

01:35.505 --> 01:38.065
and in movies,
they never got any older.

01:38.108 --> 01:39.473
I could relate.

01:39.509 --> 01:42.410
In the 1960s, I messed up.

01:42.446 --> 01:43.811
I let my guard down

01:43.847 --> 01:46.543
and I stupidly let myself
fall in love.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.949
After that, things started
to go downhill.

01:48.986 --> 01:52.080
In the '70s, I kinda lost
interest in dating.

01:52.122 --> 01:54.852
But in the '90s,
my stem turned Stacy.

01:54.891 --> 01:58.258
She was kind of lost
and I took care of her.

01:58.295 --> 02:00.786
I taught her to get hometown
soil for her coffin,

02:00.831 --> 02:02.992
how to use
hypnotic powers,

02:03.033 --> 02:05.297
and how to find the jugular
on a rodent.

02:05.335 --> 02:08.202
And she taught
me about e-mail,

02:08.238 --> 02:10.798
Napster,
and this great group,

02:10.841 --> 02:12.240
Green Day.

02:12.275 --> 02:13.640
So we have lots of fun.

02:13.677 --> 02:16.077
We party with normal kids,
we go to college.

02:16.113 --> 02:18.343
I've got over 10,000 credits.

02:18.382 --> 02:20.612
I could graduate if
it wasn't during the day.

02:21.918 --> 02:24.113
I love having a friend,

02:24.154 --> 02:26.418
or "bestie," as she calls it.

02:26.456 --> 02:28.447
And, aw,
look how cute she is.

02:30.093 --> 02:32.152
- Hey, Goody.
(phone beeps)

02:32.195 --> 02:34.493
- Goody, wake up. It's sunset.
(phone rings)

02:34.531 --> 02:35.930
Goody's voice:
The only bad thing about Stacy

02:35.966 --> 02:37.456
are her practical jokes,

02:37.501 --> 02:40.800
which she thinks are way funnier
than they actually are.

02:40.837 --> 02:42.270
Goody:
What?

02:42.305 --> 02:43.829
No, you didn't.

02:43.874 --> 02:45.865
Come on, let me out.

02:49.579 --> 02:52.104
- You got me
- Again.

02:52.149 --> 02:53.741
(Stacy laughs)

02:57.120 --> 02:59.554
Hurry, I've got an 8:00 class.

03:01.425 --> 03:03.359
Hey, Stacy.
Your friend from Boston

03:03.393 --> 03:04.792
sent your hometown soil.

03:04.828 --> 03:06.352
Oh, thank God.

03:06.396 --> 03:09.160
I hardly have any left.
My back has been killing me.

03:12.369 --> 03:14.599
"We're sorry but
your package has

03:14.638 --> 03:16.606
accidentally been
harmed in delivery."

03:16.640 --> 03:19.473
I think the Post Office
x-rays everything now,

03:19.509 --> 03:21.477
and this looked suspicious
so they opened it.

03:21.511 --> 03:23.001
But this is just dirt.

03:23.046 --> 03:25.344
Yeah, but you know
Homeland Security.

03:25.382 --> 03:28.249
Man, the terrorists ruined
things for everybody.

03:30.620 --> 03:33.282
"Visit us at www..."

03:33.323 --> 03:34.756
why do they call it visiting?

03:34.791 --> 03:37.885
Isn't it more like "type us
a letter on the computer"?

03:37.928 --> 03:40.726
Visiting is when
you go somewhere.

03:40.764 --> 03:42.425
Yeah, you're at one place
on the Internet,

03:42.466 --> 03:43.933
and then
you go someplace else.

03:43.967 --> 03:45.958
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Yes, it does.

03:46.002 --> 03:48.027
So if you're reading a book
and you turn the page,

03:48.071 --> 03:49.800
are you visiting
another page?

03:49.840 --> 03:53.367
Hold on.
You still can't find your mouth

03:53.410 --> 03:54.934
- without a mirror?
- Thank you.

04:00.317 --> 04:02.148
Sunrise is at 6:40.

04:02.185 --> 04:03.743
You know, I put that app
in your phone.

04:03.787 --> 04:05.118
You don't need the almanac.

04:05.155 --> 04:07.282
I like my almanac.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.758
What's with the mom jeans?

04:09.793 --> 04:11.954
- Jeans are jeans.
- Are you kidding?

04:11.995 --> 04:14.589
Jeans mark your age
more than a birth certificate.

04:14.631 --> 04:15.689
(scoffs)

04:15.732 --> 04:17.427
Trade shoes.
At least my gladiators

04:17.466 --> 04:18.957
will get you in
the right millennium.

04:19.002 --> 04:21.266
- Those are cute.
- Race you.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.169
Oh!

04:23.206 --> 04:25.197
(Goody groaning)

04:26.443 --> 04:29.276
(grunts)

04:29.312 --> 04:31.280
- Took you long enough.
- Well, that didn't count.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.612
- These aren't my shoes.
- Excuses, excuses.

04:33.650 --> 04:34.947
Oh, for goodness' sake.

04:34.985 --> 04:36.850
- What time does your class end?
- 9:30.

04:36.887 --> 04:38.354
Okay, then I'll meet
you at work.

04:38.388 --> 04:39.753
(rat squeaking)

04:39.790 --> 04:41.655
Goody: Oh, God.
Where are you going?

04:43.093 --> 04:44.822
(groans)
Come back here.

04:44.861 --> 04:47.853
(rat squeals)
- Goody!

04:47.898 --> 04:50.696
Cradle of Filth, Ozzy Osbourne,
The Cure...

04:50.734 --> 04:52.463
Ooh, where?

04:52.502 --> 04:55.630
Oh, no. It's one of those
daytime festival things.

04:55.672 --> 04:57.162
(groans)
Whose idiot idea was it

04:57.207 --> 04:59.038
to have rock concerts
during the day?

04:59.075 --> 05:00.940
(groans, hisses)

05:05.215 --> 05:08.844
Mmm.
Let's check the traps.

05:08.885 --> 05:11.046
Ugh, rats will eat anything.

05:11.087 --> 05:12.884
(squeaking)

05:16.193 --> 05:18.024
Oh, dead one.

05:18.061 --> 05:20.188
Oh, trap got him?

05:20.230 --> 05:22.960
I think the artificial
sweeteners gave him cancer.

05:22.999 --> 05:25.661
Woman's voice:
53rd Street.

05:25.702 --> 05:26.964
53rd Street.

05:27.003 --> 05:29.130
Woman's voice:
And 6th Avenue.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.971
53rd Street and 6th Avenue.

05:33.009 --> 05:34.772
- Penthouse suite.
(groans)

05:34.811 --> 05:36.278
- We're being summoned.
(woman's voice echoing)

05:36.313 --> 05:38.577
Stacy: Ask me questions.
Who's the stupidest person on TV?

05:38.615 --> 05:41.209
- Uh, Snooki!
- Oh, yes. You're right.

05:41.251 --> 05:43.048
53rd Street.

05:43.086 --> 05:45.213
(groans)
Who's the smartest?

05:45.255 --> 05:48.884
- Um, House or Frylock?
- Who?

05:48.925 --> 05:51.951
The limping doctor
or the flying French fry.

05:51.995 --> 05:53.360
Woman's voice:
53rd Street.

05:53.396 --> 05:56.263
- Okay, 53rd Street.
(groans)

05:57.500 --> 06:00.128
Don't you love
Times Square?

06:00.170 --> 06:02.001
It feels like the center
of the world.

06:02.038 --> 06:04.131
I feel like a bunch of TVs
threw up.

06:04.174 --> 06:06.233
Woman's voice: Take a cab.
What are you, walking?

06:06.276 --> 06:08.011
Goody: Okay, okay.
We're coming.

06:08.812 --> 06:10.746
What kind of mood
is she in?

06:10.780 --> 06:12.509
- I've seen worse.
- Has she finished feeding?

06:12.549 --> 06:14.073
Because we don't want
to be around any of that.

06:15.085 --> 06:17.417
Where are my offshoots?

06:17.454 --> 06:18.944
There they are.

06:19.956 --> 06:21.423
Look at the new fall line.

06:21.458 --> 06:24.427
Gaultier, Prada.

06:24.461 --> 06:27.055
Dries.

06:27.097 --> 06:29.122
And I can never see how
I look in them.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.460
What is the point
of looking like this

06:32.502 --> 06:34.970
if I can never enjoy it?

06:35.005 --> 06:36.302
Hmm?

06:36.339 --> 06:38.603
- Oh, sucks hard.
- Not so nice.

06:38.642 --> 06:41.543
So put them on and then
I will just imagine

06:41.578 --> 06:44.775
how much better
they will look on me.

06:46.683 --> 06:48.947
Ivan, call Mr. Pizza Guy.

06:48.985 --> 06:50.577
I thought
we were going out.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.019
I feel like a pizza guy.

06:52.055 --> 06:54.922
Oh, come on.
Those clothes are wearing you.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.823
Give it some juice.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.522
- I don't know about this one.
- Why not?

06:59.562 --> 07:01.826
It's just not for young people.

07:02.832 --> 07:04.231
Excuse me?

07:04.267 --> 07:07.566
Are you telling me
about being young?

07:07.604 --> 07:09.435
Do you have any idea

07:09.472 --> 07:12.168
how long I have been young?

07:12.208 --> 07:14.073
She just means that,
with the recession and all,

07:14.110 --> 07:16.044
girls of a certain age couldn't
afford something like this.

07:16.079 --> 07:18.980
Plus, it's fur.
It's like wearing a dead animal.

07:19.015 --> 07:20.983
Okay, here's the flaw
in that argument.

07:21.017 --> 07:22.644
Why should the life of a mink

07:22.686 --> 07:25.211
be more valuable than
the life of a pigeon?

07:25.255 --> 07:27.155
You two drink pigeons
every day.

07:27.190 --> 07:29.055
We set them free.

07:29.092 --> 07:31.856
- Stacy got attached.
- To pigeons?

07:31.895 --> 07:33.328
You know what?
We never should've named them.

07:33.363 --> 07:34.796
I know, you're so right.

07:34.831 --> 07:36.594
I mean, how can you hurt
something named Snuggles?

07:36.633 --> 07:38.157
- Or Mr. Doodles?
- Do you remember...

07:38.201 --> 07:40.192
You're pathetic.

07:40.236 --> 07:41.897
(knock on door)

07:41.938 --> 07:43.428
Pizza guy.

07:45.575 --> 07:46.769
Pizza guy.

07:49.379 --> 07:51.813
Who ordered the double cheese
and sausage?

07:51.848 --> 07:53.611
You're late.

07:53.650 --> 07:55.675
They said
20 minutes or less.

07:55.719 --> 07:58.779
You kept me waiting,
you bad boy.

07:58.822 --> 08:00.221
Sorry.

08:00.256 --> 08:03.157
You know what happens
to bad boys.

08:07.564 --> 08:09.429
I hate when she's in town.

08:09.466 --> 08:11.525
- It's disgusting.
- I know.

08:11.568 --> 08:12.967
But let's just have
a good time.

08:13.003 --> 08:14.994
- Come on, we deserve it.
Man: - Taxi!

08:15.038 --> 08:16.528
Besides, it's goth night.

08:16.573 --> 08:19.041
And all the day players
always dress up so cute.

08:19.075 --> 08:23.774
<i>♪ Crash,
the thunderous moan ♪</i>

08:25.782 --> 08:30.583
<i>♪ Thrash and rattle the bones ♪</i>

08:30.620 --> 08:32.520
<i>♪ Alone... ♪</i>

08:32.554 --> 08:33.953
We're the oldest ones here.

08:33.990 --> 08:35.684
Except for this schmo hawk.

08:35.725 --> 08:38.216
- Can I buy you ladies a drink?
- We never drink...

08:38.260 --> 08:39.956
(both)
mojitos.

08:39.996 --> 08:41.861
Maybe you should court
someone your own age.

08:41.898 --> 08:44.332
- Oh, did you see that cute one?
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.335 --> 08:46.768
- Hey.
- Hey, Renfield.

08:46.803 --> 08:49.237
Adam Ant called.
He wants his makeup back.

08:49.272 --> 08:52.002
Oh, come on. Awaken me.
I wanna live forever.

08:52.042 --> 08:54.010
Then you should try
eating more broccoli.

08:54.044 --> 08:56.410
No, I don't want to eat more
broccoli. I want to be undead.

08:56.446 --> 08:58.641
You are undead.
You're alive.

08:58.681 --> 09:01.275
Yeah, stop imagining
crazy ideas.

09:02.485 --> 09:04.919
(groans)
No.

09:04.954 --> 09:07.855
What?
- Stuck-up McVainypants is here.

09:07.891 --> 09:11.327
So what?
Just ignore him.

09:11.361 --> 09:12.919
Show him how much fun
you're having.

09:12.962 --> 09:14.361
(phone beeps)

09:14.397 --> 09:15.762
What? No!
No pictures.

09:15.799 --> 09:17.494
Wh... then take me.

09:17.534 --> 09:19.092
Come on.
Let's just go dance.

09:23.907 --> 09:26.307
Isn't this place
a little Mickey Mouse for you?

09:29.946 --> 09:32.847
There is Donor Club
in Chinatown.

09:32.882 --> 09:34.577
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:35.885 --> 09:38.080
I think I can sense
a real vampire.

09:38.121 --> 09:41.113
Vampire?
That word is so cornball.

09:41.157 --> 09:43.625
And anyone
who says "cornball"

09:43.660 --> 09:45.560
is at least 80 years old.

09:47.363 --> 09:49.228
Okay.
I just don't appreciate

09:49.265 --> 09:50.755
being called the V-word.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.131
You prefer ELF?

09:52.168 --> 09:54.830
Extended Life Form, yes.

09:54.871 --> 09:57.237
(chuckles)
So gay.

09:57.273 --> 09:58.968
- Hey.
- Hi, Ivan.

09:59.008 --> 10:01.533
I see you met Vadim.
You know he's my stem.

10:01.578 --> 10:03.637
Oh, you're the Soviet stem.

10:04.747 --> 10:06.237
Ukrainian.

10:08.184 --> 10:09.913
Let's go to that club.
Blood Bank.

10:09.953 --> 10:12.319
We don't feed
off of people.

10:12.355 --> 10:14.118
Oh, great.

10:14.157 --> 10:16.182
As long as Cisserus
takes care of herself.

10:17.393 --> 10:19.884
- Why?
- Anything happens to her,

10:19.929 --> 10:22.523
your years will accrue.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.123
(inhales deeply)
You wouldn't want

10:24.167 --> 10:26.465
to look your age.

10:26.503 --> 10:28.130
Excuse me.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.336
(hisses)

10:37.480 --> 10:39.209
I am Vadim.
This is Ivan.

10:39.249 --> 10:41.615
I'll get my coat.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.685
- Oh, Juicy.
- She is asking for it.

10:45.722 --> 10:47.314
Yeah, I'd say.

10:50.593 --> 10:51.992
Listen to me.

10:52.028 --> 10:55.088
Vadim and Ivan
are bad guys.

10:55.131 --> 10:56.598
I like bad guys.

10:59.836 --> 11:02.805
No, you like nice guys.

11:02.839 --> 11:05.831
Don't look at them
and don't talk to them.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.365
Don't talk to them.

11:07.410 --> 11:09.970
And remember,
nice guys.

11:10.013 --> 11:11.913
Nice guys.

11:17.687 --> 11:20.713
Guys that listen
when you say stuff.

11:20.757 --> 11:23.191
Guys that compliment you.

11:23.226 --> 11:25.217
Hey, Juicy.
Where are you going?

11:25.261 --> 11:27.661
<i>♪ ...a spell ♪</i>

11:27.697 --> 11:31.292
<i>♪ From chasing ♪</i>

11:31.334 --> 11:35.270
<i>♪ A star that's
long since fell in ♪</i>

11:35.305 --> 11:38.206
<i>♪ Hills and valleys ♪</i>

11:38.241 --> 11:42.007
<i>♪ But mostly valleys ♪</i>

11:42.045 --> 11:46.812
<i>♪ Are all I can see

11:46.849 --> 11:49.044
(laughing)

11:50.853 --> 11:54.345
<i>♪ Seen faintly ♪</i>

11:54.390 --> 11:58.884

12:02.198 --> 12:04.496

12:04.534 --> 12:06.798
- Hey. We're gonna go.
- BRB.

12:07.804 --> 12:10.204
Um, that only works
if you're leaving.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.730
"Be right back."

12:11.774 --> 12:15.073
- Oh. SL.
- What?

12:15.111 --> 12:18.239
- "So long"?
- Close enough.

12:21.484 --> 12:23.179
(sniffing)

12:23.219 --> 12:25.483
So I tell my parents I'm coming
to the city for my music.

12:25.521 --> 12:27.648
And they say okay,
as long as I go to NYU.

12:27.690 --> 12:29.317
(sniffs)
You want?

12:29.359 --> 12:31.850
No thanks.
I'm already in the mood.

12:34.631 --> 12:36.292
So now they're all,
"What about law school?"

12:36.332 --> 12:38.197
And I go, "I told you I was
coming here for my music."

12:38.234 --> 12:40.668
So they're, "Then why did we
spend $100,000, Derek?"

12:40.703 --> 12:42.227
I'm like, "You got me.
You could've just gotten me

12:42.272 --> 12:44.001
Pro Tools and I'd be happy.
Law school is your dream,

12:44.040 --> 12:45.337
not mine."

12:45.375 --> 12:47.002
And they think it's all
about record deals,

12:47.043 --> 12:48.533
but it's so different now.
They're so old-fashioned.

12:48.578 --> 12:49.943
They just don't get it,
you know?

12:49.979 --> 12:52.106
Hey, my parents
believed in witches.

12:52.148 --> 12:54.412
Hold on, I gotta play
you something.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.547
(music playing)

12:57.587 --> 12:58.918
Mm.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.191
(moans)

13:07.764 --> 13:09.789
You've got...
you've got something.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.824
Hmm?
You want a rail?

13:12.869 --> 13:14.564
(whimpers)

13:20.877 --> 13:23.072
A little bit won't hurt.

13:34.590 --> 13:36.785
(sighs)

13:43.166 --> 13:45.760
(groans)
I gotta get out of here.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.775
Hey, people can see you.

13:54.811 --> 13:56.244
What?
Nobody cares.

13:56.279 --> 13:58.770
Besides, the streets are wet
and my shoes are suede.

13:58.815 --> 14:01.477
Stacy, I kinda did
something bad.

14:01.517 --> 14:03.917
- What?
- Well, this drummer guy

14:03.953 --> 14:06.387
was all coked up and his nose
started bleeding.

14:06.422 --> 14:08.890
- Oh, no.
- I just licked a drop.

14:08.925 --> 14:10.790
And what now? Are you jonesing?
Do you have the hunger?

14:10.827 --> 14:12.021
No.

14:12.061 --> 14:14.256
I just had what came out.
It wasn't even flowing.

14:14.297 --> 14:18.165
But I know it would be so much
more satisfying than this whole

14:18.201 --> 14:20.328
get-dressed-go-out-
and-have-sex routine.

14:20.370 --> 14:22.930
I mean, guys used
to want to sing

14:22.972 --> 14:24.667
or paint or write.

14:24.707 --> 14:27.574
Now, it's like iPod hits
and webisodes.

14:27.610 --> 14:29.703
Half the time, I don't even know
what they're talking about.

14:29.746 --> 14:31.805
Well, we're going to group tomorrow.
That always helps.

14:31.848 --> 14:34.112
(men laughing)
- Hey.

14:34.150 --> 14:36.175
Didn't that used to be
a yogurt place?

14:36.219 --> 14:37.777
Things keep changing
around here.

14:37.820 --> 14:40.516
Well, in the '70s,
it was a methadone clinic

14:40.556 --> 14:42.854
and all the hippies
would be sitting on the stairs

14:42.892 --> 14:44.757
waiting for their medicine.

14:44.794 --> 14:47.160
And in the '50s,
it was a dance studio,

14:47.196 --> 14:51.394
and everyone came to the Village
to be beatniks.

14:51.434 --> 14:54.164
And before that,
it was a German newspaper.

14:55.204 --> 14:56.694
How do you
know this stuff?

14:57.707 --> 15:00.870
- The History Channel.
- Oh.

15:00.910 --> 15:02.935
(birds chirping)
- Uh-oh, birds.

15:02.979 --> 15:04.378
- Hurry. Go, go!
- Whoops!

15:04.414 --> 15:06.006
- Get back.
- Watch out, Kenny!

15:06.048 --> 15:08.250
Oh!

15:08.251 --> 15:09.548
(siren blaring)

15:16.325 --> 15:18.350
Officer: That's Van Helsing.
Let him through.

15:20.363 --> 15:21.853
Oh, no, no, no.
This doesn't have

15:21.898 --> 15:23.456
anything to do
with Homeland Security

15:23.499 --> 15:25.160
so get away from
my crime scene, huh?

15:25.201 --> 15:26.691
Did you recover the neck?

15:26.736 --> 15:29.569
Look, it's your garden variety
John Doe.

15:29.605 --> 15:31.300
Killed, bled out
someplace else,

15:31.340 --> 15:33.171
they hacked it up
and dumped it here.

15:33.209 --> 15:35.939
You call this bled out?
It's bone dry.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.809
- Detective.
(laughs)

15:37.847 --> 15:40.577
Officer 2: Excuse me, ma'am.
I need you to back up, please.

15:41.584 --> 15:43.176
What is that,
a pizza carrier?

15:45.021 --> 15:47.080
There.
You happy now?

15:47.123 --> 15:49.887
Hey, if we find a subway map
and explosives, we'll call you.

15:52.829 --> 15:54.319
- Whoa.
(woman gasps)

15:56.599 --> 15:58.328
Good evening.
My name is Harry,

15:58.367 --> 16:00.335
and welcome to
Sanguines Anonymous.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.406
Tepish, you're a stem,
aren't you?

16:06.442 --> 16:09.138
Someone told me
that if a stem dies,

16:09.178 --> 16:11.043
all the offshoots die.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.139
It's an old wives' tale, right?

16:13.182 --> 16:15.173
I thought as long as you stayed
out of the sun, you're okay.

16:15.218 --> 16:17.448
And if your stem died,
you start aging.

16:17.487 --> 16:21.446
No, you start aging,
but not like the day players.

16:21.491 --> 16:24.722
You become
your chronological age.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.318
When were you awakened?

16:26.362 --> 16:28.057
1841.

16:28.097 --> 16:30.531
Ah, pfft.
Baby.

16:30.566 --> 16:33.626
Besides,
200 is the new 80.

16:33.669 --> 16:36.035
Stacy turned in 1992.

16:36.072 --> 16:38.540
Does she know
how old you are?

16:38.574 --> 16:39.939
No.

16:39.976 --> 16:43.070
It seemed to comfort her
thinking we were the same age.

16:43.112 --> 16:44.340
Ah, I see.

16:44.380 --> 16:47.611
- You're from Cisserus, huh?
- You know her?

16:49.085 --> 16:50.575
We had a fling.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.053
Mm.

16:52.088 --> 16:54.522
That took about
a century off my life.

16:54.557 --> 16:56.320
Hey.

16:57.727 --> 17:01.128
Tepish, would you like
to start off tonight?

17:01.163 --> 17:02.892
Okay.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.632
Thank you, Harry.

17:07.670 --> 17:09.160
Hi, everyone.

17:09.204 --> 17:11.173
I am Vlad Tepish.

17:11.207 --> 17:12.435
You know,
Vlad the Impaler.

17:12.474 --> 17:13.999
All:
Hi, Vlad Tepish.

17:14.042 --> 17:17.979
I have abstained
from the fluids of homo sapiens

17:18.013 --> 17:21.915
for 362 years.

17:21.951 --> 17:23.851
(cheering, clapping)

17:25.555 --> 17:27.352
I'm sure that you've heard
about what I did

17:27.390 --> 17:28.880
to the Turkish army, huh?

17:28.925 --> 17:30.290
Woman:
He impaled them.

17:30.326 --> 17:33.295
You youngsters have to learn
how to substitute

17:33.329 --> 17:37.390
what you can't do with things
that are less harmful.

17:37.433 --> 17:40.698
Personally,
I like knitting.

17:40.736 --> 17:42.328
Especially...

17:44.140 --> 17:46.665
- this part.
(crowd laughing)

17:46.709 --> 17:48.438
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

17:52.848 --> 17:56.648
- Hi, I'm Stacy.
- Hi, Stacy.

17:56.686 --> 17:59.484
I've been in my 20s
for two decades,

17:59.522 --> 18:03.117
and when I was a day player,
I was doing a lot of E.

18:03.159 --> 18:05.150
Man: E?
I don't know what that is.

18:05.194 --> 18:07.355
That's ecstasy.

18:07.396 --> 18:10.832
And then one night,
I must've been pretty stoned,

18:10.866 --> 18:12.197
'cause I don't even remember,

18:12.234 --> 18:15.169
but I know Cisserus
was feeding on me,

18:15.204 --> 18:17.331
and Goody was arguing
that I would be a good

18:17.373 --> 18:19.102
clothing model for her.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.905
So if it wasn't for Goody,
I would be dead.

18:21.944 --> 18:24.037
Like, dead-dead.

18:25.414 --> 18:28.713
But she says that I saved her
because she'd been so lonely,

18:28.751 --> 18:31.447
and having a friend made
her want to keep existing.

18:31.487 --> 18:34.479
Even though I've never
had human blood,

18:34.523 --> 18:36.423
I still feel tempted.

18:36.459 --> 18:38.893
But it's like drugs.

18:38.928 --> 18:41.419
We don't need
the high-highs.

18:41.464 --> 18:44.024
It's more satisfying
to not hurt anybody

18:44.066 --> 18:45.658
and just have fun
with your friends.

18:45.701 --> 18:47.362
(clapping)

18:48.838 --> 18:51.033
- Thanks.
Harry: - Good meeting, people.

18:51.073 --> 18:53.234
Shall we?

18:53.275 --> 18:56.301
All: When it comes to
drinking human blood,

18:56.345 --> 18:59.212
a single drop is too much,

18:59.248 --> 19:02.183
and a whole family
is never enough.

19:02.218 --> 19:04.413
Support your fellow ELFs.

19:04.453 --> 19:08.082
Undead is not unfeeling.

19:08.124 --> 19:09.853
Great.

19:28.044 --> 19:29.739
What are you doing?

19:29.779 --> 19:31.371
Don't you hate it when
you sprout fangs,

19:31.414 --> 19:33.541
part's white and then
the other part's dingy?

19:33.582 --> 19:35.447
I never thought about it.

19:35.484 --> 19:37.952
(phone rings)
- It's Renfield.

19:37.987 --> 19:40.353
Both: - Hey, Renfield!
- Where are you guys?

19:40.389 --> 19:41.686
Let's go to SoHo House.

19:41.724 --> 19:43.555
I'm sick of these clip joints.

19:43.592 --> 19:46.789
How about this?
You go, and if it's great, text us.

19:46.829 --> 19:48.023
All right. G2G

19:48.064 --> 19:49.895
Both:
G2G.

19:49.932 --> 19:51.422
"Got to go."

19:51.467 --> 19:54.698
(sighs)
Why can't kids say entire words?

19:54.737 --> 19:56.637
It takes just as long
to say letters.

19:56.672 --> 19:59.004
Remember, we said
that we'd keep up with the times

19:59.041 --> 20:00.770
even though it's not as good
as the '80s.

20:00.810 --> 20:02.402
You don't hear me
complaining every time

20:02.445 --> 20:04.345
a new song comes on
that Devo is much better.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.245
That's true.

20:06.282 --> 20:07.943
You have a glob.

20:07.983 --> 20:10.451
- Here?
- Other side.

20:10.486 --> 20:13.455
- Here?
- A little higher.

20:13.489 --> 20:16.083
(groans)
Doesn't it drive you crazy

20:16.125 --> 20:17.558
not knowing
what you look like?

20:17.593 --> 20:19.151
You look the same
as you always did.

20:19.195 --> 20:21.561
- You have pictures from before.
- No.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.224
You don't have any pictures
from your early years?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.130
No.

20:25.167 --> 20:26.964
A guy in the park drew this.

20:27.002 --> 20:28.697
Do I look anything like this?

20:28.738 --> 20:30.638
(laughs)
Oh, yeah.

20:30.673 --> 20:32.436
- He really captured you.
- Oh.

20:32.475 --> 20:34.375
Hold on.

20:38.981 --> 20:42.542
Okay, she sort of has
your structure.

20:42.585 --> 20:44.576
You have rounder eyes,

20:44.620 --> 20:46.417
shorter chin,

20:46.455 --> 20:49.117
change the hair,

20:49.158 --> 20:50.489
green eyes,

20:50.526 --> 20:52.289
and...

20:52.328 --> 20:54.421
fix the nose.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.260
- And print.
(printer whirrs)

21:00.503 --> 21:02.266
Oh, my God.

21:04.106 --> 21:06.700
- That's me.
- Yeah.

21:06.742 --> 21:08.801
It's been so long.

21:08.844 --> 21:13.042
I take back everything bad
I ever said about computers.

21:13.082 --> 21:14.549
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.811
(birds chirping)
- Ooh.

21:22.424 --> 21:25.293
- Good morning.
- Morning.

21:25.294 --> 21:28.229
(phones beeping)
(music playing)

21:35.538 --> 21:37.870
(gasps)
Ew.

21:37.907 --> 21:40.068
Well, LASIK has come
a long way.

21:43.379 --> 21:46.075
- Hi, I'm Joey.
- Hi, I'm Stacy.

22:20.115 --> 22:22.106
Hey, would you like to have
lunch with me sometime?

22:22.151 --> 22:23.618
- No.
- Okay.

22:24.787 --> 22:27.347
Um, no, what I meant was
I work during the day

22:27.389 --> 22:31.223
but I could have coffee
or drinks.

22:31.260 --> 22:33.228
Okay, great.

22:37.433 --> 22:40.095
All right,
any questions?

22:40.135 --> 22:41.625
Yes, Professor Quincy.

22:41.670 --> 22:43.934
How many surrealists does
it take to change a light bulb?

22:43.973 --> 22:46.464
- How many?
- A bicycle.

22:46.508 --> 22:47.907
(students groan)

22:47.943 --> 22:50.207
Well, thank you for that wonderful
insight, Mr. Van Helsing.

22:52.514 --> 22:55.483
Quincy: All right, I know
that was no "Talladega Nights."

22:55.517 --> 22:57.747
Now what was Dalí
trying to do in this?

22:59.722 --> 23:03.089
Stacy, don't take a nap.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.615
You'll be up all day.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.720
I'm so tired.
I was IM'ing all day.

23:10.366 --> 23:12.357
I barely slept.

23:12.401 --> 23:14.028
I met someone
at school.

23:14.069 --> 23:16.401
- What's his story?
- He's silly.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.338
Goofy but cute.

23:18.374 --> 23:20.808
- What's his name?
- His name?

23:20.843 --> 23:22.777
Um, his name is Joey...

23:22.811 --> 23:24.210
Van Helsing.

23:24.246 --> 23:25.611
What?

23:25.648 --> 23:28.811
I'm sure it's a coincidence.
It's a common name.

23:28.851 --> 23:31.786
And you didn't hit it off
with Timmy Hitler?

23:31.820 --> 23:33.287
Very funny.

23:33.322 --> 23:34.755
I don't like it.

23:35.758 --> 23:37.953
I can take care
of myself.

23:41.563 --> 23:43.394
Guess what Joey
wants to do this weekend?

23:43.432 --> 23:46.265
- Behead you?
- Ha-ha.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.694
Man: I need to see
my wife's chart.

23:49.738 --> 23:52.298
You know, I've asked about
four times in the past hour.

23:52.341 --> 23:55.208
So get me
the goddamn chart.

23:55.244 --> 23:58.771
And don't start
with the shifts.

23:58.814 --> 24:01.510
And you won't be sued
for malpractice

24:01.550 --> 24:02.915
if you do it now.

24:02.952 --> 24:05.079
Hell no, we won't go.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.145
Hell no,
we won't go.

24:07.189 --> 24:08.679
Hell no...

24:08.724 --> 24:11.192
Man: Enough already.
I've had enough.

24:28.177 --> 24:30.611
Man: Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.

24:30.646 --> 24:31.806
Love you.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.839
I told them not to bring
you any... look at this.

24:34.883 --> 24:37.317
I don't want you to eat this.
Look at this.

24:37.353 --> 24:39.719
They use this for breast
implants in the other wing.

24:39.755 --> 24:41.484
Guess where I went?
Cappuccino.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.321
- Oh...
- Look at this.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.920
How much?
How much do we love cannoli?

24:50.466 --> 24:52.297
All right, maybe later.

24:54.303 --> 24:55.998
How you doing in there?

24:56.038 --> 24:58.700
(lid creaks open)
- Ugh.

24:58.741 --> 25:02.370
- I'm tired.
- Oh, shit.

25:03.846 --> 25:06.076
- You got jury duty.
- What?

25:06.115 --> 25:09.414
- 8:00 a.m.
- No.

25:09.451 --> 25:11.112
How could this happen?

25:11.153 --> 25:13.280
We're paid in cash.
We don't do taxes.

25:13.322 --> 25:14.721
I don't even have
a driver's license.

25:14.757 --> 25:16.281
Our credit cards
are through a third party.

25:16.325 --> 25:18.520
(gasps)
Oh. I voted once.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.892
- You what?
- I voted for Dukakis.

25:20.929 --> 25:24.023
- Dukakis?
- It was before I turned.

25:24.066 --> 25:25.863
And I was just thinking
about the good of the country.

25:25.901 --> 25:28.267
Goody: Country?
It's just business.

25:28.303 --> 25:30.498
From the Dutch West
India Company

25:30.539 --> 25:32.006
to the slave trade.

25:32.041 --> 25:33.531
How do you know
all this stuff?

25:34.710 --> 25:36.974
Um, The History Channel.

25:37.012 --> 25:38.707
(phone chimes)

25:38.747 --> 25:40.840
Yay!

25:40.883 --> 25:43.716
If you're here and he's there,
why don't you talk?

25:43.752 --> 25:45.310
Nobody talks.

25:45.354 --> 25:46.878
Do you want him
to think I'm 40?

25:50.692 --> 25:52.785
So, if the city has
too much garbage,

25:52.828 --> 25:54.261
and rats eat garbage,

25:54.296 --> 25:56.230
why don't we just get rats
to eat the garbage

25:56.265 --> 25:58.130
instead of spraying
toxic crap everywhere?

25:58.167 --> 25:59.828
- Rats breed too quickly.
- So?

25:59.868 --> 26:01.062
What if we give them
birth control?

26:01.103 --> 26:02.832
You mean get rats
to put on condoms?

26:02.871 --> 26:05.237
Yeah.
Teensy-weensy little condoms.

26:05.274 --> 26:07.799
Who's that old hippie
talking to Fred?

26:07.843 --> 26:09.743
You must mean the girls from
the graveyard shift.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.769
Shit.
I used to go out with him

26:11.814 --> 26:13.042
before you and I
knew each other.

26:13.082 --> 26:15.243
Oh, my God. He's gonna
expect you to be like 40.

26:15.284 --> 26:17.775
- I know.
- Hi.

26:17.820 --> 26:20.050
Wow.

26:20.089 --> 26:21.681
How is it possible?

26:21.723 --> 26:23.520
How is what possible?

26:25.761 --> 26:27.922
Goody, you have not
aged a day.

26:27.963 --> 26:29.760
Mister, my name is Susan.

26:29.798 --> 26:32.631
But my mother's name was Goody.
Did you know her?

26:32.668 --> 26:35.967
Goody Rutherford?
Is that your mother?

26:36.004 --> 26:38.234
Yes, but she passed away.

26:38.273 --> 26:41.367
Oh.
I-l-I'm sorry.

26:41.410 --> 26:44.345
My name is Danny Horowitz.

26:44.379 --> 26:46.973
Did she ever, uh, you know,
like, mention me?

26:48.684 --> 26:50.743
I think.

26:50.786 --> 26:52.276
- But we have to get to work.
- Hey.

26:52.321 --> 26:55.779
Hi, I under... listen.
I have to talk to you.

26:55.824 --> 26:58.019
Please call me tomorrow.

26:58.060 --> 26:59.618
Okay.
Tomorrow night.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.289
(chuckles)
Night, of course.

27:02.331 --> 27:04.196
Just like your mother.

27:04.233 --> 27:06.428
Okay.

27:12.774 --> 27:15.641
- So, is this your place?
- It's my parents' place.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.168
When my ex and I broke up,
I was traveling

27:18.213 --> 27:21.114
and I haven't found
a new place yet.

27:21.150 --> 27:23.675
Computer: - Iris recognition.
- So, what does your dad do?

27:23.719 --> 27:25.550
Well, he works for
Homeland Security now,

27:25.587 --> 27:28.681
but he was with MI-6 in London
for quite a long time.

27:28.724 --> 27:31.454
So is he, um,
some kind of spy?

27:31.493 --> 27:34.758
Yeah, like James Bond
but shorter.

27:35.797 --> 27:37.856
Listen, Stacy.
There's something I have to tell you.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.097
- What?
- I'm older than you think.

27:41.136 --> 27:43.969
I've been helping my dad with
this project for a few years,

27:44.006 --> 27:47.464
and since I'm still in school,
you probably think I'm, like, 20.

27:47.509 --> 27:49.534
But I'm almost 25.

27:49.578 --> 27:53.173
- And since you're like 17...
(laughs)

27:53.215 --> 27:56.150
Um, actually
I'm a little bit older

27:56.185 --> 27:57.948
than the other kids, too.

27:57.986 --> 27:59.783
You are?

28:00.856 --> 28:02.380
Well, great.
Well, how old are you?

28:02.424 --> 28:04.722
You don't ask
a lady her age.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.251
- Well, why not?
- Because it's very impolite.

28:07.296 --> 28:09.025
- How am I gonna find out?
- I don't know.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.089
I'm gonna nick
your passport.

28:11.133 --> 28:13.693
Woman: I'm never going again.
The performance was ghastly.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.602
No, the clown was so...

28:16.638 --> 28:18.799
- Joey.
- Oh.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.307
I didn't know
you had company.

28:20.342 --> 28:22.139
We just got back.
This is Stacy.

28:22.177 --> 28:24.008
Stacy, my mother and father.

28:24.046 --> 28:25.445
- Hi, Stacy.
- Oh, pleasure.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.811
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, yeah.

28:26.848 --> 28:28.782
- How do you do?
- Hi.

28:28.817 --> 28:30.307
Well, I actually
have to get to my job.

28:30.352 --> 28:33.617
- You work at night?
- Yeah, it's so depressing.

28:33.655 --> 28:37.022
But, you know,
just until school gets out.

28:37.059 --> 28:38.856
- I have to go.
- I'll see you out.

28:41.063 --> 28:42.496
- Ta!
- Yeah.

28:42.531 --> 28:43.930
(door closes)

28:43.966 --> 28:46.764
- Did you feel her hands?
- Freezing.

28:46.802 --> 28:49.896
(people chanting)

28:49.938 --> 28:51.530
I'm glad you're interested.
Are you a registered voter?

28:51.573 --> 28:53.268
No matter what's going
on in the world,

28:53.308 --> 28:55.833
there's always someone
protesting or petitioning,

28:55.877 --> 28:58.175
and they always wind up
in Union Square.

29:00.015 --> 29:03.542
Even in the 1840s, people were
pamphleteering for abolition.

29:03.585 --> 29:05.576
...southern flesh peddlers!

29:05.621 --> 29:07.885
Slavery will tear
our country apart!

29:07.923 --> 29:09.948
Sir, may I proffer
you a pamphlet?

29:09.992 --> 29:12.085
Abolition now!

29:12.127 --> 29:14.994
Sir... sir, may I proffer
you a pamphlet?

29:17.199 --> 29:18.757
And in the 1950s,

29:18.800 --> 29:21.530
thousands of people
protested to stop

29:21.570 --> 29:23.470
the execution
of the Rosenbergs.

29:25.274 --> 29:28.368
Of course, in the '60s, there was
always a Vietnam demonstration.

29:28.410 --> 29:29.707
Hell no, we won't go!

29:29.745 --> 29:32.111
Hell no, we won't go!

29:32.147 --> 29:35.207
Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no...

29:35.250 --> 29:38.686
Must've been pretty crazy to see
your old boyfriend like that, huh?

29:39.688 --> 29:41.246
How long were
you guys together?

29:41.290 --> 29:43.258
Over a year.
We never lived together,

29:43.292 --> 29:45.522
but we saw each other
every night.

29:45.560 --> 29:49.428
I forgot how nice it felt seeing
someone you love all the time.

29:50.766 --> 29:53.257
I wonder what Joey's parents
think about me.

29:53.302 --> 29:54.860
So what did you think
of Stacy?

29:54.903 --> 29:56.700
(clears throat)
She's rather pale.

29:56.738 --> 29:58.035
How do you mean?

29:58.073 --> 30:00.098
What your mother means
is she's...

30:01.109 --> 30:03.669
exceedingly white.

30:03.712 --> 30:05.373
So you don't like her because
of the color of her skin?

30:05.414 --> 30:06.745
Is that what
you're telling me?

30:06.782 --> 30:08.272
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

30:08.317 --> 30:10.217
No, it's simply that
she's not like us.

30:10.252 --> 30:12.083
You mean wealthy,
over-educated,

30:12.120 --> 30:14.315
Upper-West-Side,
paranoid, ghoul-chasing...

30:14.356 --> 30:16.586
Oh, for fuck's sake.
She's undead!

30:16.625 --> 30:19.594
(sighs)
- And I forbid you to see her!

30:19.628 --> 30:21.118
You think everyone
is a vampire.

30:21.163 --> 30:22.687
Just because somebody stays up late,
doesn't go to bed before 3:00...

30:22.731 --> 30:24.096
Well excuse me for being
overly vigilant.

30:24.132 --> 30:25.599
...doesn't mean
they can just grow fangs,

30:25.634 --> 30:27.465
- put on a black cape...
- But I think beings

30:27.502 --> 30:29.663
- devoid of warm blood...
- ...and fly around town like a bat!

30:29.705 --> 30:31.104
Just because
they're a little peaky,

30:31.139 --> 30:32.504
it doesn't mean
they drink blood.

30:32.541 --> 30:34.668
...roam the street at night
looking for innocent victims.

30:34.710 --> 30:36.177
You are so intolerant.

30:36.211 --> 30:39.647
Enough!
Stop it, both of you.

30:39.681 --> 30:42.309
Let's just invite
your little friend to supper.

30:42.351 --> 30:44.512
If she's one of them,
we'll know.

30:44.553 --> 30:46.180
Fine.

30:48.056 --> 30:51.321
Tonight, we're meeting
under sad circumstances.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.885
I'm sure by now you've
all heard about David's

30:53.929 --> 30:56.124
tragic Daylight Savings accident.

30:56.164 --> 30:57.631
(group murmurs)

30:57.666 --> 30:59.600
Harry:
Boy, one century you're here

30:59.634 --> 31:01.226
and the next you're gone.

31:02.571 --> 31:04.232
Do you sense
something gross?

31:06.408 --> 31:08.035
Yes.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.441
Harry:
I see we have a newcomer.

31:09.478 --> 31:11.503
Uh, yeah, hi.
I'm Rita.

31:11.546 --> 31:12.979
All:
Hi, Rita.

31:13.014 --> 31:15.073
I am a psy-vampire.

31:15.117 --> 31:17.415
(faint laughing)

31:17.452 --> 31:20.250
- What exactly is that?
- Psychic vampire.

31:20.288 --> 31:23.746
I'm able to feed off
other people's auras.

31:23.792 --> 31:25.987
You know,
I absorb their energy.

31:26.027 --> 31:28.325
How do you know you're
not just annoying them?

31:28.363 --> 31:29.523
(laughing)

31:29.564 --> 31:32.829
Psy-vampires are
a true vampiric subset, okay?

31:32.868 --> 31:35.098
And we don't need blood
to draw...

31:35.137 --> 31:36.729
(growls)

31:36.772 --> 31:38.433
(screaming)

31:38.473 --> 31:40.441
What the fuck is that?

31:40.475 --> 31:42.500
(laughing)

31:42.544 --> 31:44.739
All right, all right.
Settle down.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.509
Harry: We really
gotta be more careful

31:46.548 --> 31:48.345
about how we announce
our meetings.

31:48.383 --> 31:50.681
Anybody else
have something to share?

31:50.719 --> 31:52.778
Stacy got called in
for jury duty,

31:52.821 --> 31:54.812
but she hasn't voted
since the '80s.

31:54.856 --> 31:56.084
That happened to me.

31:56.124 --> 31:58.024
And they're bringing me in
for an audit.

31:58.059 --> 31:59.686
Everybody call
on your stems

31:59.728 --> 32:01.593
and any human-feeders
you know.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.154
But how are we
gonna find Cisserus?

32:03.198 --> 32:04.529
You don't know
her resting place?

32:04.566 --> 32:06.557
When she wants us,
she summons us.

32:06.601 --> 32:08.330
We never call on her.

32:08.370 --> 32:09.701
Okay.

32:09.738 --> 32:11.330
We all gotta work together, folks.

32:11.373 --> 32:13.967
The community
is being persecuted.

32:14.009 --> 32:16.136
I've seen it all before.

32:16.178 --> 32:19.944
Now instead of tortures,
they're using computers.

32:22.350 --> 32:24.545
Does Mr. Davidoff
know you are coming?

32:24.586 --> 32:27.111
Mr. Davidoff is aware

32:27.155 --> 32:29.646
we'll be here between
7:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.

32:30.659 --> 32:33.059
But don't you need
a search warrant?

32:33.094 --> 32:36.928
Madam, you've insultingly
confused us with the police.

32:36.965 --> 32:38.432
I'm from Time Warner,

32:38.467 --> 32:40.731
and if you ever want to see
Jon Stewart again,

32:40.769 --> 32:42.293
you'll open this door.

32:44.739 --> 32:46.400
Let's get some light in here.

32:51.613 --> 32:53.012
Van Helsing:
Morning, Sunshine.

32:53.048 --> 32:55.141
(growling)

32:55.183 --> 32:57.310
(grunts)
(screams)

32:57.352 --> 32:59.684
(growling)

33:11.566 --> 33:14.364
(singing in Spanish)

33:17.739 --> 33:19.764
Buenas noches, chicas.

33:19.808 --> 33:21.298
Have you seen Ivan?

33:21.343 --> 33:23.311
He hasn't answered
any of my summonses.

33:23.345 --> 33:25.336
Uh, I think we saw him
last week.

33:25.380 --> 33:26.847
Something must have happened.

33:26.882 --> 33:28.474
He's not strong enough
to ignore you.

33:28.517 --> 33:31.714
Well, you chicas
will just have to fill in.

33:31.753 --> 33:34.586
But we're only good at modeling
and light clerical work.

33:34.623 --> 33:38.081
So, you fold these carefully,

33:38.126 --> 33:40.356
and you pack this soil.

33:40.395 --> 33:43.728
Don't you just love
these "As-seen-on-TV" bags?

33:45.033 --> 33:47.297
(air hissing)

33:49.804 --> 33:51.328
Look how much soil
it can fit.

33:52.340 --> 33:54.001
Oh, it's a good thing we're here
because there's gonna be

33:54.042 --> 33:56.772
a big meeting with all
the local stems and ELFs.

33:56.811 --> 33:59.041
Stacy: There's been a lot of
persecution of the community.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.310
- What do I care?
- Well, if you keep acting

34:01.349 --> 34:03.044
so recklessly,
they're gonna find you.

34:03.084 --> 34:06.315
No one will ever
find my lair.

34:06.354 --> 34:09.983
And I'm in the one place
no New Yorker ever goes.

34:10.025 --> 34:12.152
But your behavior makes
it harder for everyone else.

34:12.193 --> 34:13.717
For who?

34:13.762 --> 34:16.128
For Vlad Tepish
and his doofus peasants?

34:16.164 --> 34:17.824
"Vlad the Impaler"?

34:17.866 --> 34:20.357
I'll tell you what that whole
impaling routine was.

34:20.402 --> 34:22.233
Compensation.

34:22.270 --> 34:23.998
You know what I'm saying?

34:24.039 --> 34:27.304
Besides, I am leaving town.

34:29.177 --> 34:31.543
And look at this pimpin'
travel coffin he made me.

34:33.214 --> 34:35.114
Here's the itinerary.

34:35.150 --> 34:37.482
Just get me on cargo
before dawn.

34:37.518 --> 34:38.918
It's a private jet.

34:38.954 --> 34:40.853
Spain?
What's in Spain?

34:40.889 --> 34:42.914
It is not just the rain
in Spain.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.789
Look at him.

34:44.826 --> 34:46.690
Diego Bardem.

34:46.728 --> 34:49.525
Only the handsomest,
most talented man in the world.

34:49.563 --> 34:52.533
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't know him.

34:52.567 --> 34:54.467
But I got mad love for him.

34:54.502 --> 34:55.935
And I'll tell you a secret.

34:57.772 --> 35:01.367
I am not gonna use
any hypnotism.

35:02.844 --> 35:04.869
I want this to be real.

35:06.915 --> 35:10.612
I haven't felt this way about
anyone since Al Jolson.

35:10.652 --> 35:12.176
The Mammy guy?

35:13.188 --> 35:14.985
Yes, the Mammy guy.

35:15.023 --> 35:17.821
I mean, he was an amazingly
dynamic performer.

35:17.859 --> 35:20.953
You have no idea because
you never saw him live.

35:23.264 --> 35:24.788
No, no, no.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.164
(trilling)

35:26.201 --> 35:27.828
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

35:33.308 --> 35:33.375
(phone rings)
- Hey.

35:33.376 --> 35:35.639
(phone rings)
- Hey.

35:36.645 --> 35:38.613
What did your parents
say about me?

35:38.647 --> 35:41.013
- Are you near your computer?
- Yeah.

35:41.049 --> 35:42.346
Come on iChat.
I wanna see you.

35:43.351 --> 35:44.716
(screams)
- Oh!

35:44.753 --> 35:47.688
I don't... I don't have iChat.

35:47.722 --> 35:49.451
Yeah, you do.
It's built in.

35:49.491 --> 35:51.891
Yeah, but my roommate
was spray painting

35:51.926 --> 35:53.791
and she got paint
on the lens.

35:53.828 --> 35:55.295
- So...
- Pfft.

35:55.330 --> 35:56.820
What did
your parents say?

35:56.865 --> 35:59.561
They thought
you were a bit pale.

36:01.236 --> 36:02.965
What do you mean pale?

36:03.004 --> 36:04.801
Well, you know, pale,
fair skin.

36:04.839 --> 36:07.000
Like maybe you were sick
or something.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.636
Well, it's just those
environmental light bulbs.

36:09.678 --> 36:11.168
I mean, they make everybody
look horrible.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.009
Look, they want you to come
for dinner on Friday.

36:13.048 --> 36:14.538
Can you make it?

36:14.582 --> 36:16.243
Oh, I'll be there.

36:21.423 --> 36:25.723
<i>♪ Hope they got
a jukebox on the moon ♪</i>

36:28.196 --> 36:32.565

37:20.181 --> 37:21.671
(giggles)

37:21.716 --> 37:24.276
- It's good, right?
- I think it's totally working.

37:24.319 --> 37:25.809
I'm gonna be so tan.

37:25.854 --> 37:27.287
(doorbell chimes)

37:29.557 --> 37:31.047
Hi.

37:32.060 --> 37:33.550
Wow.
You look...

37:33.595 --> 37:35.062
Robust?

37:35.096 --> 37:37.564
Sure.

37:37.599 --> 37:39.692
Come in.
Dinner will be a few minutes.

37:39.734 --> 37:41.634
Let me give you
the tour.

37:46.775 --> 37:48.265
What is all this stuff?

37:48.309 --> 37:50.174
Well, it's mostly stuff
from my grandfather

37:50.211 --> 37:51.678
or my great grandfather.

37:51.713 --> 37:55.080
My father is an expert
on vampirism.

37:55.116 --> 37:56.913
Told you my family's nuts.

37:56.951 --> 37:59.613
- What's this thing?
- Ah, well...

37:59.654 --> 38:02.350
if someone you suspect of being
a vampire dies,

38:02.390 --> 38:04.551
you place this over their neck
before they're buried

38:04.592 --> 38:07.686
and if they wake up and try
to climb out of their coffin,

38:07.729 --> 38:10.459
they get beheaded.

38:10.498 --> 38:12.432
Mrs. Van Helsing:
Dinner's ready!

38:22.143 --> 38:24.509
Hey, I know him.

38:24.546 --> 38:26.138
Van Helsing:
You know him?

38:26.181 --> 38:28.012
I mean,
I know who he is.

38:28.049 --> 38:29.880
It's Vlad Tepish.

38:29.918 --> 38:32.011
It's pronounced "Tee-pees."

38:32.053 --> 38:36.490
He was one of the most sadistic
figures in history.

38:36.524 --> 38:40.255
Well, I guess that sort of
depends on your point of view.

38:40.295 --> 38:41.922
Really?

38:41.963 --> 38:44.090
How many points of view
can there be on the subject

38:44.132 --> 38:46.896
of impaling people
and drinking their blood?

38:46.935 --> 38:49.130
If a weird stunt like that stops

38:49.170 --> 38:51.968
the entire Ottoman Empire
from taking over Europe.

38:52.006 --> 38:54.236
His armor is in
the museum in Bucharest.

38:54.275 --> 38:56.573
I mean, they consider
him a hero.

38:56.611 --> 38:59.774
Yeah, if it wasn't for him,
we'd all be speaking "Ottomanese."

38:59.814 --> 39:02.112
Didn't you like your fish?

39:02.150 --> 39:03.708
Shall we make
something else for you?

39:03.751 --> 39:06.811
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Van Helsing.

39:06.855 --> 39:09.187
I'm enjoying my dinner
a great deal.

39:09.224 --> 39:13.217
Now, you must try our soup.

39:13.261 --> 39:15.661
It's an old Van Helsing recipe.

39:20.635 --> 39:22.330
Ahh!

39:22.370 --> 39:24.736
Not a fan of garlic?

39:24.772 --> 39:27.536
Stacy: Oh, no, it's not the garlic.
It's the salt.

39:27.575 --> 39:29.634
Even the tiniest bit
and I blow up

39:29.677 --> 39:32.111
like a Thanksgiving Day
balloon.

39:32.146 --> 39:33.943
My father thinks that
if he gives us garlic breath,

39:33.982 --> 39:35.574
we won't make out.

39:35.617 --> 39:37.608
Not going to work, Pops.

39:37.652 --> 39:40.086
Ma, we'll take dessert later.
The movie starts at 9:30.

39:40.121 --> 39:41.611
I'll just get our things.

39:44.959 --> 39:46.483
(breathes deeply)

39:55.937 --> 39:57.700
(laughs)

40:00.775 --> 40:02.504
Hmm.

40:02.543 --> 40:05.444
You have a very strong will,
Dr. Van Helsing.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.744
What are your intentions
with my son?

40:07.782 --> 40:09.113
What do you mean?

40:09.150 --> 40:12.119
Do you plan to suck
the life out of him?

40:12.153 --> 40:15.020
No more than
any other girlfriend.

40:16.124 --> 40:17.751
Hey, you ready?

40:19.494 --> 40:21.189
Thank you for dinner.

40:21.229 --> 40:23.459
- See you later.
(doorbell rings)

40:24.999 --> 40:27.297
Oh, I know.
But did you see the girl

40:27.335 --> 40:29.530
who left with Joey?
Is she one of them?

40:29.570 --> 40:32.698
I wasn't really paying attention.
That girl, she seemed pretty dark.

40:32.740 --> 40:35.538
But it's all gonna be on my phone.
So hold on.

40:35.576 --> 40:38.511
Wait, I don't remember
seeing empty chairs.

40:38.546 --> 40:40.309
What did I do wrong?

40:40.348 --> 40:42.976
You didn't do
anything wrong.

40:43.017 --> 40:45.247
(singing)

40:45.286 --> 40:47.516
(beeps)

40:51.559 --> 40:53.254
Why do people
bother going out

40:53.294 --> 40:54.886
if the only thing
they want to bond with

40:54.929 --> 40:56.294
is their little
glowing boxes?

40:56.331 --> 40:58.162
Don't go grandma on me.

40:58.199 --> 40:59.928
- Oh, there's Renfield.
- Hey.

40:59.968 --> 41:02.334
Uh, you guys, um...

41:02.370 --> 41:05.203
kinda can't sit here unless
we order a $400 bottle.

41:05.239 --> 41:07.469
- Don't worry about it.
Waitress: - Bottle service.

41:09.610 --> 41:12.545
She left him 10 minutes ago.
The sex must be great.

41:12.580 --> 41:14.707
Oh, we haven't done it yet.

41:14.749 --> 41:17.115
Oh, so it's a purely
textual relationship?

41:18.786 --> 41:21.584
I've been looking for you,
you lifeless bitch.

41:21.622 --> 41:23.180
What is your problem?

41:23.224 --> 41:25.021
What did you do to Ivan?

41:25.059 --> 41:26.526
What are you talking about?

41:26.561 --> 41:28.586
(hissing)

41:28.629 --> 41:31.655
(lisping) First you kill
my game with Juicy girl.

41:31.699 --> 41:33.599
Now Ivan is missing.

41:33.634 --> 41:35.363
Suckerin' succotash.

41:35.403 --> 41:37.234
(growling)

41:37.271 --> 41:39.239
- Guys, guys, guys!
(screaming)

41:39.273 --> 41:41.104
Not in front of the day players.

41:42.176 --> 41:44.007
The past few minutes,
you remember nothing.

41:44.045 --> 41:45.342
Complete Sergeant Schultz.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.075
(German accent)
I know nothing!

41:47.115 --> 41:49.845
- I saw nothing!
- Now cut it out.

41:49.884 --> 41:52.352
Besides, why would
we hurt Ivan?

41:52.387 --> 41:54.753
We'd just wind up doing
more work for Cisserus.

41:54.789 --> 41:56.381
Actually, it's a good thing
we ran into you.

41:56.424 --> 41:58.619
We need you to come to
a Sanguines Anonymous meeting.

41:58.659 --> 42:00.752
- No way.
- You don't have to join,

42:00.795 --> 42:02.956
but a lot of weird stuff
has been going down.

42:02.997 --> 42:04.760
They're trying to force us
out into the sun.

42:04.799 --> 42:07.563
You think this has something
to do with Ivan's disappearance?

42:07.602 --> 42:09.092
It might.

42:09.137 --> 42:11.765
Did anyone in his building
see anything?

42:11.806 --> 42:13.865
The neighbor said the cable
company was there.

42:13.908 --> 42:16.741
Can Time Warner just burst into
a person's home and kill them?

42:16.778 --> 42:18.405
Yeah, they're terrible.

42:18.446 --> 42:20.243
(sighs)

42:20.281 --> 42:22.340
Come to a meeting.
We've got to figure this out.

42:22.383 --> 42:24.010
Everybody's getting audited.

42:24.052 --> 42:25.713
Well, you don't have to go.

42:25.753 --> 42:27.152
What?

42:27.188 --> 42:29.088
An audit is just
the IRS saying,

42:29.123 --> 42:30.613
"We think you should
pay more taxes."

42:30.658 --> 42:32.649
And if you agree with them,
then you say, "Okay, how much?"

42:32.693 --> 42:35.491
But you only have to go in
if you wanna challenge them.

42:35.530 --> 42:37.157
How do you know this?

42:37.198 --> 42:38.665
I'm a CPA.

42:38.699 --> 42:40.189
- You are?
- Yeah.

42:40.234 --> 42:41.724
You just got
some new clients.

42:43.237 --> 42:44.805
Not me.
I have a guy.

42:44.806 --> 42:46.899
(music playing)

42:57.118 --> 42:58.608
Stacy:
What are you wearing?

42:58.653 --> 43:00.416
It's like the history
of fashion.

43:00.455 --> 43:04.050
I'm going to see Danny.
I wanna look nice.

43:04.092 --> 43:06.253
Gibson Girl shirts
were the prettiest.

43:06.294 --> 43:09.127
1960s skirts are great
on short women.

43:09.163 --> 43:12.496
1970s shoes make you tall
but are comfortable.

43:12.533 --> 43:14.364
Okay, but what's
with the hat?

43:14.402 --> 43:15.801
It's a boater.

43:15.837 --> 43:17.634
People always said
it looked spiffy on me.

43:17.672 --> 43:19.731
People from
your barbershop quartet

43:19.774 --> 43:22.004
or people from
the Republican convention?

43:22.043 --> 43:24.068
Oh, God.

43:25.913 --> 43:27.107
Here we are.

43:27.148 --> 43:29.639
"Architectural Digest" time.
Enjoy yourself.

43:29.684 --> 43:31.049
Sure you don't
want anything to drink?

43:31.085 --> 43:32.814
- I'm sure.
- Well, I'm not.

43:32.854 --> 43:34.879
I need some coffee, man.
For energy.

43:37.191 --> 43:38.658
I just made this last week.

43:38.693 --> 43:40.684
- Oh.
- You work for the government?

43:40.728 --> 43:42.719
Do I look like I work
for the government?

43:42.763 --> 43:44.390
I'm with the ACLU.

43:44.432 --> 43:46.992
Right now I'm in the middle
of this deportation case

43:47.034 --> 43:50.834
with abuses of wiretapping.
It's unbearable.

43:50.872 --> 43:52.737
Well, I thought
if the government

43:52.773 --> 43:55.503
doesn't hear terrorist-related stuff,
they have to hang up.

43:55.543 --> 43:57.340
No.

43:58.346 --> 43:59.677
Ah, look at this.

43:59.714 --> 44:01.545
I was going through these
looking for your mother.

44:04.619 --> 44:06.086
Look at these.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.145
She had this habit of just

44:08.189 --> 44:11.750
ducking out right before
they took a picture.

44:11.792 --> 44:13.783
Well, she was superstitious.

44:13.828 --> 44:15.591
Still, I mean,
it's a little nutty, isn't it?

44:15.630 --> 44:17.029
My God.

44:17.064 --> 44:19.191
- I have this one.
- You do? Really?

44:19.233 --> 44:21.030
She saved it?

44:21.068 --> 44:22.831
You better put yours
in plastic.

44:22.870 --> 44:24.929
She liked this, huh?
Well, why not?

44:24.972 --> 44:27.270
I was not bad-looking
back then, huh?

44:28.676 --> 44:30.541
What an amazing
time this was.

44:30.578 --> 44:33.479
Being young and in love.

44:33.514 --> 44:36.039
Feeling like you're a part of
something that really mattered.

44:37.885 --> 44:40.285
Your mother never mentioned
why she just disappeared?

44:40.321 --> 44:42.949
- Not really.
- Oh, man.

44:42.990 --> 44:44.582
Hey, you know what?

44:44.625 --> 44:48.391
I have to get movies for my wife
before the store closes.

44:48.429 --> 44:50.863
- Right on.
- Huh?

44:50.898 --> 44:52.798
My way.

44:52.833 --> 44:55.097
- I'll go with.
- Oh.

44:55.136 --> 44:56.626
All right, cool.

44:56.671 --> 44:58.764
You know,
Angela is really in and out.

44:58.806 --> 45:01.536
And that's why I gotta get her
movies that she really loves.

45:01.576 --> 45:03.168
So, you know,
when she dozes off,

45:03.211 --> 45:05.042
you know, she won't miss
anything, really.

45:05.079 --> 45:07.138
- Can I help?
- Uh, no.

45:07.181 --> 45:08.842
When I see 'em,
I'll know it.

45:08.883 --> 45:11.443
- Then I'm gonna look around.
- Okay, cool.

45:14.088 --> 45:15.885
(groans)
Excuse me.

45:15.923 --> 45:17.720
Do you have any
James Cagney posters?

45:17.758 --> 45:19.123
Oh, James Cameron?

45:21.262 --> 45:23.025
No, uh, James Cagney.

45:23.064 --> 45:25.555
You know, "Made it, Ma!
Top of the world!"

45:25.600 --> 45:27.227
(chuckles)
No.

45:27.268 --> 45:28.929
What about...

45:28.970 --> 45:30.801
- Fred Astaire?
- No.

45:30.838 --> 45:32.499
- Jack Lemmon?
- No.

45:32.540 --> 45:35.771
- Paul Newman.
- Oh, the salad dressing guy?

45:37.678 --> 45:40.511
- Yeah.
- No.

45:46.053 --> 45:47.577
Phones on the ground.

45:47.622 --> 45:50.750
Phones on the ground now.
Drop 'em!

45:50.791 --> 45:52.691
Hands in the air. Hands in the air.
Give me the money.

45:52.727 --> 45:54.285
Woman: Don't you point that.
He's got a heart condition.

45:54.328 --> 45:56.296
- Shut up!
- Oh, my God!

45:56.330 --> 45:58.059
Fuck.
Come on!

45:58.099 --> 45:59.896
- He's having a heart attack.
- No, no, no, lady.

45:59.934 --> 46:01.401
Get up and give me
the money now.

46:01.435 --> 46:03.733
- Shit, come on!
- Oh!

46:06.007 --> 46:07.736
Stop it.

46:07.775 --> 46:09.037
Calm down.

46:10.711 --> 46:12.645
(hisses)

46:15.383 --> 46:16.941
(sighs)

46:20.655 --> 46:22.418
Mm.
Feel better?

46:22.456 --> 46:24.390
Yeah.
(chuckles)

46:25.459 --> 46:27.188
You are gonna take this couple
to the hospital.

46:27.228 --> 46:28.991
And no more stealing

46:29.030 --> 46:30.463
The bite was from your cat.

46:30.498 --> 46:32.898
You guys,
take CPR courses.

46:32.933 --> 46:35.493
You hate junk food.

46:35.536 --> 46:37.367
And get "Public Enemy."

46:37.405 --> 46:39.532
The Cagney one.

46:41.208 --> 46:42.835
You all right?

46:43.911 --> 46:46.379
I could hypnotize you,

46:46.414 --> 46:48.974
but I've been wanting to tell you.

46:49.984 --> 46:51.781
So what are you saying?
You broke up with me 'cause

46:51.819 --> 46:54.049
you wouldn't drink my blood?
Is that what you're telling me?

46:54.088 --> 46:56.750
I don't drink human blood.

46:56.791 --> 46:59.726
You don't?
That guy, what was that?

46:59.760 --> 47:03.161
No. Have you ever seen
a vampire bat?

47:04.665 --> 47:07.964
A little rodent can get
the blood out of an entire cow

47:08.002 --> 47:10.903
in a few minutes because
of this enzyme in their saliva.

47:10.938 --> 47:13.202
It's a completely safe
blood thinner.

47:13.240 --> 47:14.867
And I also have it.

47:14.909 --> 47:17.377
I didn't drink
that man's blood.

47:17.411 --> 47:20.209
I spit into him
to stop the stroke.

47:20.247 --> 47:23.045
Oh.
You just spit into him.

47:23.084 --> 47:25.018
Oh, that's a whole
other ball game.

47:25.052 --> 47:27.919
Well, if I didn't, he would have
had a lot of brain damage.

47:27.955 --> 47:29.388
How old are you?

47:31.625 --> 47:33.115
A little older than you.

47:33.160 --> 47:35.720
So people can only be
around you for, like, what...

47:35.763 --> 47:36.957
a year or something?

47:36.997 --> 47:38.862
No, I could go around
seven years

47:38.899 --> 47:40.890
without them expecting
me to look older.

47:40.935 --> 47:44.427
And I would've stayed with
you for as long as possible.

47:44.472 --> 47:46.406
But when you became
one of the student leaders,

47:46.440 --> 47:49.170
people on the street
recognized you.

47:49.210 --> 47:52.373
I thought,
"This is his time."

47:52.413 --> 47:56.110
You could have your choice
of any woman out there.

47:56.150 --> 47:58.084
It didn't seem right
to rob you of the chance

47:58.119 --> 48:00.053
to meet someone amazing.

48:01.789 --> 48:04.451
And you did, didn't you?

48:04.492 --> 48:06.960
I did.
I really did.

48:06.994 --> 48:08.723
And you know what?
I really should check

48:08.763 --> 48:10.731
and see how she's doing.

48:10.765 --> 48:12.096
And I gotta tell
you something else.

48:12.133 --> 48:15.034
I feel like I'm really, like,
tripping right now.

48:15.069 --> 48:17.264
Am I gonna see you again?

48:17.304 --> 48:19.704
Uh...

48:19.740 --> 48:22.208
of course, yeah.

48:23.210 --> 48:25.770

before World War II.

49:21.535 --> 49:23.469
The sleepwalker
keeps murdering people,

49:23.504 --> 49:25.836
but only because the evil guy
has him under a spell.

49:25.873 --> 49:28.103
What does that remind you of?

49:29.109 --> 49:30.838
I'm flummoxed.

49:30.878 --> 49:33.403
Germany?
Evil spell?

49:33.447 --> 49:35.005
Adolf?

49:35.049 --> 49:36.812
Your eyes remind me
of somebody.

49:36.851 --> 49:38.716
Adolf Hitler.

49:38.752 --> 49:40.481
No, that wasn't
who I was thinking of.

49:40.521 --> 49:43.684
Audrey Hepburn.
Same initials, though.

49:43.724 --> 49:46.352
Can you please just focus
on symbolism?

49:46.393 --> 49:48.384
Sorry.

49:49.497 --> 49:51.431
Joey:
Can I be under your spell?

49:51.465 --> 49:53.330
Or better still,
you could be under my spell.

49:53.367 --> 49:55.130
What are you
gonna make me do?

49:55.169 --> 49:57.262
Laugh hysterically.

49:57.304 --> 49:58.601

50:21.495 --> 50:24.157
Has it ever been like that
for your before?

50:24.198 --> 50:26.359
Not since the '80s.

50:30.771 --> 50:33.069
(birds chirping)
(gasps)

50:36.043 --> 50:37.533
Hey, where are you going?

50:37.578 --> 50:38.943
Um, I've got an early class.

50:38.979 --> 50:40.708
Well, ditch it
and come back to bed.

50:40.748 --> 50:43.842
I can't.
But I'll call you later.

50:43.884 --> 50:45.511
Come on, my parents won't
be home until tomorrow.

50:45.553 --> 50:48.579
Look, it's a little early in the
relationship to get into this,

50:48.622 --> 50:50.055
but I've really gotta go.

51:03.003 --> 51:04.732
What the...

51:04.772 --> 51:07.070
(stammering)

51:11.211 --> 51:13.179
- Something bothering you?
- What?

51:14.281 --> 51:15.612
No.

51:15.649 --> 51:17.514
(phone rings)
(gasps)

51:17.551 --> 51:20.042
If there's anything
you wanna talk about...

51:20.087 --> 51:22.851
maybe trouble
with Stacy, or...

51:26.694 --> 51:28.457
Yeah, 'cause you'd love that.

51:28.495 --> 51:31.521
He's not answering my texts,
my tweets, my e-mails,

51:31.565 --> 51:32.930
my voicemail,
my Facebook messages...

51:32.967 --> 51:34.434
Do you think
he'll tell his father?

51:34.468 --> 51:36.459
No, he wouldn't do that.
What about Danny?

51:36.503 --> 51:37.936
Do you think he'll
tell the authorities?

51:37.972 --> 51:40.099
- He'd never.
- How do you know?

51:40.140 --> 51:41.630
Danny hates authority.

51:41.675 --> 51:43.472
I'm gonna go to his class
so he has to confront me.

51:46.146 --> 51:47.738
- Are you mad at me?
(screams)

51:49.083 --> 51:50.607
- Don't go away.
- Huh? What?

51:54.755 --> 51:56.586
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:57.591 --> 51:59.786
How do you like
them apples?

51:59.827 --> 52:01.886
Garlic?

52:01.929 --> 52:03.055
You were afraid of it
the other night.

52:03.097 --> 52:05.497
Yeah, because
I've always hated garlic.

52:07.301 --> 52:08.859
Can we please just
talk about this?

52:08.902 --> 52:11.632
- My father tried to warn me.
- Against what?

52:11.672 --> 52:14.106
I have never harmed a human
being or a domestic animal

52:14.141 --> 52:15.802
my entire life.

52:15.843 --> 52:18.175
Oh, so you didn't go after me
'cause I'm a Van Helsing?

52:18.212 --> 52:20.840
No. If anything,
I would've stayed away.

52:20.881 --> 52:22.371
Besides, if I wanted
to drink your blood,

52:22.416 --> 52:24.976
would I have written you
this 10-page report

52:25.019 --> 52:28.284
on Freud and his influence
on surrealist imagery?

52:32.526 --> 52:35.017
How do I know
you wrote this for me?

52:35.062 --> 52:37.826
Because I also wrote one
on World War I

52:37.865 --> 52:39.992
and how it gave birth
to Surrealism.

52:40.034 --> 52:41.524
Actually, I like
that one better.

52:41.568 --> 52:43.365
Oh, you do?

52:43.404 --> 52:45.634
So now you trust me, huh?

52:45.673 --> 52:47.106
I trust you to give yourself
the better grade.

52:47.141 --> 52:48.574
I don't blame you.

52:57.418 --> 52:59.579
You know
I would never hurt you, right?

52:59.620 --> 53:01.679
Yeah.

53:01.722 --> 53:03.587
Well, then what is it?
Is it the day thing?

53:03.624 --> 53:05.421
Do you want to have a girlfriend

53:05.459 --> 53:07.120
you can go hiking with
and go to the beach?

53:07.161 --> 53:10.494
No, I'm... I'm more of
a night person.

53:10.531 --> 53:12.021
Is it the blood, then?

53:12.066 --> 53:15.558
- You wanna try new restaurants?
- No, I'm not much of a foodie.

53:15.602 --> 53:17.263
So what is it?

You know what? I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.

53:52.239 --> 53:54.537
I shouldn't be dumping

54:43.690 --> 54:46.716
- Hey, Renfield. Come on in.
- Hey. How are you, Goody?

54:46.760 --> 54:48.921
Jesus.

54:48.962 --> 54:50.953
- Hey, Renfield.
- Hey, how are you?

54:50.998 --> 54:53.262
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Yes.

54:53.300 --> 54:55.393
But... I mean,
this can't bother you.

54:55.435 --> 54:58.529
It bothers me
if you're hurting yourself.

54:58.572 --> 55:00.130
Well, then awaken me.

55:00.174 --> 55:02.301
It doesn't work that way.

55:02.342 --> 55:03.707
You're an accountant.
Do the math.

55:03.744 --> 55:05.234
If every infected person

55:05.279 --> 55:07.713
fed on or infected
the rest of the people,

55:07.748 --> 55:10.717
the entire population would've
eaten itself off the planet

55:10.751 --> 55:13.151
Iong before Christ
was even born.

55:13.187 --> 55:15.849
Only a stem
can turn someone.

55:15.889 --> 55:17.379
Is that the sweater
Tepish knit you?

55:17.424 --> 55:19.221
Mm-hmm. It would be impolite
not to wear it.

55:19.259 --> 55:20.783
And it goes with everything.

55:20.828 --> 55:23.263
Wait till you see the one
he's making you.

55:24.965 --> 55:26.830
Okay, people.

55:26.867 --> 55:28.732
This is an amazing event.

55:28.769 --> 55:31.169
Except for Cisserus,
we have all the stems

55:31.205 --> 55:33.400
from the tri-state area.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.409
- Vadim the Russian,
- Ukrainian.

55:36.443 --> 55:39.003
- Ashwan from Kush.
All: - Hi, Ashwan.

55:39.046 --> 55:41.674
- Ghuri, the Turkish stem.
All: - Hi, Ghuri.

55:41.715 --> 55:43.182
Yuppa, yuppa.

55:43.217 --> 55:44.946
Harry:
I'd like to start by asking,

55:44.985 --> 55:47.579
how many of you
have gotten subpoenas?

55:47.621 --> 55:50.647
(group murmuring)

55:50.691 --> 55:52.090
Excuse me.

55:52.125 --> 55:55.754
Why do not
we just eat the lawyers?

55:55.796 --> 55:59.391
You crazy.
We can't eat all the lawyers.

55:59.433 --> 56:00.730
Why not?

56:00.767 --> 56:02.826
Let's just say eating lawyers
is out of the question.

56:02.870 --> 56:04.337
(groaning)
- I know you can sense

56:04.371 --> 56:06.396
that we have
day players among us.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.840
This is my granddaughter,
Sarah.

56:08.876 --> 56:11.071
All: - Hi, Sarah.
- And this is our friend Renfield.

56:11.111 --> 56:13.341
He's a CPA so he can help
with the IRS stuff.

56:13.380 --> 56:16.611
And I understand
we have a lawyer here.

56:16.650 --> 56:18.208
You absolutely do.

56:18.252 --> 56:20.652
How you doin?
My name is Danny.

56:20.687 --> 56:23.281
All: - Hi, Danny.
- And I'm from the ACLU.

56:23.323 --> 56:25.553
From what I understand,
you can't be forced out

56:25.592 --> 56:28.425
during the day and you don't
want anyone to molest

56:28.462 --> 56:30.430
your resting places.

56:30.464 --> 56:33.194
But the government can enter
your home any time they want

56:33.233 --> 56:34.632
because of the Patriot Act.

56:34.668 --> 56:36.693
See what's going down now

56:36.737 --> 56:39.900
is that all your cell phones
and your iPhones

56:39.940 --> 56:42.534
and all the computers
are helping them find you.

56:42.576 --> 56:46.672
So I urge you not to use
any of your electronic devices.

56:46.713 --> 56:49.273
How will we do anything?

56:49.316 --> 56:51.113
How do we even stay in touch
with each other?

56:51.151 --> 56:53.244
I used to write things down.

56:53.287 --> 56:56.484
- Oh, yeah. Like in a datebook.
- Right.

56:56.523 --> 56:59.151
But I need my computer
to tell me sunrise and sunset.

56:59.192 --> 57:01.387
Oh, I can tell everyone that
on my almanac.

57:04.998 --> 57:07.899
Under "Sky Watch,"
it's got phases of the moon,

57:07.935 --> 57:11.803
high tide, sunrise and sunset,
and... good Lord!

57:11.838 --> 57:13.328
What?
What is it?

57:13.373 --> 57:16.171
Total eclipse of the sun
in two weeks.

57:16.209 --> 57:17.437
(gasps)
Goody: - Hold on, hold on.

57:17.477 --> 57:19.570
2:10 to 3:40.

57:19.613 --> 57:21.513
Too bad that wasn't
the exact time of our summons.

57:21.548 --> 57:23.482
If we had face time,
we could use hypnotism.

57:24.484 --> 57:26.611
No, why? That wouldn't
make any difference.

57:26.653 --> 57:28.746
Couldn't we just change
the times of the appointments?

57:28.789 --> 57:31.417
Yeah. We could get you
completely eliminated

57:31.458 --> 57:33.221
from their system.
We could delete and change

57:33.260 --> 57:34.591
everything
in their computers.

57:34.628 --> 57:36.994
You know,
I can see why

57:37.030 --> 57:38.691
you have sworn off
human blood.

57:38.732 --> 57:40.597
Awesome.
Do you want to join?

57:40.634 --> 57:42.693
How would you ladies
like to be my wives?

57:42.736 --> 57:44.328
(scoffs)
Eat me.

57:44.371 --> 57:47.272
- All right.
- Not literally.

57:48.642 --> 57:51.304
(music playing)

57:52.846 --> 57:55.144
(rats squeaking)

57:58.218 --> 58:00.778
Oh, are you okay?

58:00.821 --> 58:03.187
You were sick yesterday, too.

58:03.223 --> 58:04.690
(vomits)

58:04.725 --> 58:06.886
Look what I got you.

58:06.927 --> 58:08.861
(gasps)
- Pure pharmaceutical grade.

58:08.895 --> 58:11.159
Oh, but they're so cute.

58:11.198 --> 58:14.190
They're not like vermin.
They could be somebody's pets. Hi!

58:14.234 --> 58:15.667
I figured they wouldn't
make you sick.

58:15.702 --> 58:17.499
It's nothing.
I'm fine.

58:17.537 --> 58:19.971
It's just when I get up.

58:20.007 --> 58:22.601
Quit futzing.
We have to go.

58:24.845 --> 58:26.335
Oh, don't start with me.

58:26.380 --> 58:29.178
- Drop waists are coming back.
- Yeah, says who?

58:29.216 --> 58:31.343
I saw a picture
of Keira Knightley in one.

58:31.385 --> 58:32.818
Yeah, right.

58:32.853 --> 58:35.185
That's because
Keira Knightley's in a movie.

58:35.222 --> 58:38.191
- Ha, look at you!
- I know.

58:38.225 --> 58:40.318
This was
my college interview outfit.

58:40.360 --> 58:42.225
Were you trying
for a football scholarship?

58:42.262 --> 58:45.026
Ha-ha. It's the only thing
I have that looks respectful.

58:45.065 --> 58:46.259
(laughs)

58:46.299 --> 58:48.733
Child: - Whoa, check it out.
Man: - I know, it's crazy.

58:48.769 --> 58:52.705
Child 2: Mom, look!
I've never seen it before.

58:52.739 --> 58:56.698
Mother: Don't look
directly at it, honey.

58:56.743 --> 58:59.541
Wow, I totally forgot
what it was like.

58:59.579 --> 59:01.843
It's an entirely
different world.

59:01.882 --> 59:04.316
Oh, so many women.

59:04.351 --> 59:05.477
Have a nice day.

59:05.519 --> 59:08.147
Come on, everybody. Let's go.
We only have two hours.

59:08.188 --> 59:10.383
Hey, so do you know
where we're going?

59:10.424 --> 59:11.721
You will do what
my accountant says.

59:11.758 --> 59:12.918
It's CPA.

59:18.698 --> 59:20.928
Okay, this is Ghuri.

59:20.967 --> 59:23.265
This is file number 318.

59:23.303 --> 59:24.930
This Vlad Tepish.

59:24.971 --> 59:27.439
He was granted asylum in, um...

59:27.474 --> 59:29.635
1583.

59:29.676 --> 59:33.168
Currently married
to a US citizen.

59:33.213 --> 59:35.272
Well, four.

59:35.315 --> 59:36.339
Yeah, that's okay.

59:36.383 --> 59:38.408
Child of
an American fiancée.

59:38.452 --> 59:40.113
For an adjustment
of status.

59:40.153 --> 59:42.986
A student visa so
he can matriculate at UCLA.

59:43.023 --> 59:44.513
Go Bruins.

59:44.558 --> 59:45.957
Yeah.

59:50.997 --> 59:54.364
Stacy Daimer is unable to perform
jury duty obligations.

59:54.401 --> 59:56.961
Unable to perform
jury duty obligations.

59:57.003 --> 59:59.369
- In fact, I'll just delete them.
- Just delete them.

59:59.406 --> 01:00:00.998
Put the deleted names
in the trash.

01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:02.440
Deleted names in trash.

01:00:02.476 --> 01:00:03.807
- Empty the trash.
- Empty the trash.

01:00:03.844 --> 01:00:07.143
Ask the IT guy
to remove the hard drive.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:09.842
- Go, go, go!
- Excuse us, coming through!

01:00:09.883 --> 01:00:11.942
(squealing)

01:00:16.022 --> 01:00:18.081

01:00:33.173 --> 01:00:35.232
Man: Joey!

01:00:52.592 --> 01:00:54.856
Man 2: Yeah!

01:00:54.895 --> 01:00:57.363
(squeaking)

01:00:59.232 --> 01:01:01.029
Let me see. Open.

01:01:01.067 --> 01:01:03.331
(makes kissing noises)

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.065
Hold it up.
Hold it up.

01:01:05.105 --> 01:01:06.970
Aw, beautiful color.

01:01:07.007 --> 01:01:10.534
They're having the book launch
party for The Situation

01:01:10.577 --> 01:01:12.442
right now on 10th.
What do you say?

01:01:12.479 --> 01:01:13.912
- Ugh.
- Not worth the candle.

01:01:13.947 --> 01:01:15.380
We're happy here.

01:01:15.415 --> 01:01:17.576
Every A-lister in New York
will be there.

01:01:17.617 --> 01:01:19.448
You can have
whoever you want.

01:01:19.486 --> 01:01:21.545
Mm.
You get tired of that.

01:01:23.156 --> 01:01:24.919
(gasps)
Oh, I like this song.

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.482
- You wanna dance.
- Yeah, do you?

01:01:26.526 --> 01:01:28.391
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:28.428 --> 01:01:30.555
(phone beeps)

01:01:34.434 --> 01:01:35.924
Aren't you gonna dance?

01:01:35.969 --> 01:01:37.300
Me?
I don't think so.

01:01:37.337 --> 01:01:40.204
- I'm not very good, no.
- Yes, you are.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.401

- Yeah, but I don't remember.

Hmm.
Wonder who that could be.

01:02:30.357 --> 01:02:32.587
Oh, isn't it insane?

01:02:32.626 --> 01:02:34.423
I was dating for 25 years

01:02:34.461 --> 01:02:37.487
and I've never imagined to feel
this way about somebody.

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:39.327
What about
you and Danny?

01:02:39.366 --> 01:02:41.527
Mm, I never stopped
loving him.

01:02:41.568 --> 01:02:44.560
But his wife's sick so there's
no even thinking about it.

01:02:44.604 --> 01:02:46.401
I'm just happy around him.

01:02:46.439 --> 01:02:47.963
Reminds me
of being hopeful.

01:02:48.008 --> 01:02:50.602
But how great would it be
if we both had relationships?

01:02:50.644 --> 01:02:52.271
I mean,
wouldn't it be so cool...

01:02:52.312 --> 01:02:53.836
Cisserus's voice:
Mott Street.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.871
Mott Street.
Oh!

01:02:55.915 --> 01:02:57.644
What is she doing
back so soon?

01:02:57.684 --> 01:02:59.174
I guess things didn't
work out with Diego.

01:02:59.219 --> 01:03:00.652
- Ugh.
- She's in Chinatown.

01:03:00.687 --> 01:03:03.223
God, just when things
were going so well.

01:03:03.224 --> 01:03:04.781
(growls)

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:07.224
Mm.

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.455
Oh... oh, God.

01:03:09.496 --> 01:03:10.861
(burps)

01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:13.297
I've never seen
real dead people.

01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:14.766
What did you do?

01:03:14.801 --> 01:03:16.530
(Yiddish accent)
You know how it is

01:03:16.569 --> 01:03:18.935
when you eat Chinese.

01:03:18.972 --> 01:03:21.497
Half an hour later
you're hungry again.

01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:23.202
How could you?

01:03:23.243 --> 01:03:24.938
(groans)

01:03:24.978 --> 01:03:27.276
Oh, I just can't
stop eating.

01:03:27.314 --> 01:03:28.872
I'm so depressed.

01:03:28.915 --> 01:03:31.145
Why didn't he like me?

01:03:31.184 --> 01:03:34.244
I am so much more bomb-ass
than his girlfriend.

01:03:34.287 --> 01:03:36.812
Maybe she wasn't
a homicidal maniac.

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:38.084
Maybe.

01:03:38.124 --> 01:03:40.319
This is disgusting!

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.691
I know.

01:03:41.728 --> 01:03:44.196
I could so easily
hate myself.

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:47.324
But just because
you overdid it one day,

01:03:47.367 --> 01:03:50.165
doesn't mean
you have to be bad all weekend.

01:03:50.203 --> 01:03:51.864
- What's wrong with him?
(waiter moaning)

01:03:51.905 --> 01:03:53.395
(laughing)

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.635
Finish him off,
will ya?

01:03:58.411 --> 01:04:01.005
I said kill him.

01:04:02.282 --> 01:04:03.772
(sighs)

01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:15.388
(sighs)
You really can't kill.

01:04:15.428 --> 01:04:18.625
You guys are so useless.

01:04:18.665 --> 01:04:20.326
Forget it.

01:04:21.868 --> 01:04:25.235
Hey, can I have
a fortune cookie, at least?

01:04:29.376 --> 01:04:31.207
(birds chirping)

01:04:37.617 --> 01:04:40.085
(phone rings)
Goody: - That was way too close.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.610
Stacy:
And I didn't put in rollers.

01:04:41.654 --> 01:04:43.178
I'm gonna have
coffin hair tomorrow.

01:04:43.223 --> 01:04:44.850
Goody:
I know.

01:04:44.891 --> 01:04:48.383
Stacy: Goody, I don't think I can
do anything like that again.

01:04:48.428 --> 01:04:50.157
Goody:
Me either.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.968
The world changes,
we have to adapt.

01:05:00.006 --> 01:05:01.871
These violent old ways

01:05:01.908 --> 01:05:03.671
don't make
any sense anymore.

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:05.974
But she won't listen.

01:05:06.012 --> 01:05:09.448
- She's insane.
- Oh, tell me about it.

01:05:11.684 --> 01:05:14.050
Tepish, is there
anything like a...

01:05:14.087 --> 01:05:15.918
Sanguine's doctor?

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.513
Stacy is sick.

01:05:17.557 --> 01:05:19.286
That's impossible.
We don't get sick.

01:05:19.325 --> 01:05:22.817
That's what I thought, but every night
when we get up, she vomits.

01:05:22.862 --> 01:05:25.797
Just how old was she
when she was awakened?

01:05:25.832 --> 01:05:27.322
20.

01:05:27.367 --> 01:05:29.096
And I assume
there is a boyfriend.

01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:30.796
- Why?
(chuckles)

01:05:30.837 --> 01:05:32.862
She's not sick.
She's pregnant.

01:05:32.906 --> 01:05:35.033
So she can have a baby?

01:05:35.074 --> 01:05:38.009
No, the pregnancy
will end by itself.

01:05:38.044 --> 01:05:40.035
Unless she turns back.

01:05:40.079 --> 01:05:42.343
Like, if Cisserus dies?

01:05:42.382 --> 01:05:44.942
(groans)
Cisserus.

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:47.646
Don't you worry, hmm?

01:05:47.687 --> 01:05:50.781
Stacy will be just fine
in about a week.

01:05:52.025 --> 01:05:54.323
They notified us
about a patient having seizures

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.590
who had a double puncture wound.
When I asked who checked him in,

01:05:56.629 --> 01:05:58.790
I went back to
their surveillance cameras.

01:05:58.832 --> 01:06:00.663
- Where's the body?
- Mount Sinai.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.225
- Tell them we're coming.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:07.296
All right,
sit down, listen to me.

01:06:08.541 --> 01:06:10.202
Now, I know
you think I'm crazy,

01:06:10.243 --> 01:06:13.076
but you have to do
something for me.

01:06:13.112 --> 01:06:14.238
Sure.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.271
Carry this with you
at all times.

01:06:16.316 --> 01:06:19.285
- What?
- This is how you load it.

01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:21.310
Only use the silver bullets.

01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:23.219
Only use them on what?
Stacy?

01:06:23.256 --> 01:06:25.053
Just keep it with you.

01:06:25.091 --> 01:06:27.355
Don't give me any shit.

01:06:27.393 --> 01:06:31.625
When a problem comes along,
like hunger, you must whip it.

01:06:31.664 --> 01:06:34.497
It says this guy's a comic?
He's not even funny.

01:06:34.534 --> 01:06:36.126
I've never seen him
in anything.

01:06:36.169 --> 01:06:37.796
What's on?

01:06:37.837 --> 01:06:40.135
"Assholes Insult People
More Talented Than Them."

01:06:40.173 --> 01:06:43.472
"The Excessively '80s
Countdown."

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:44.943
Oh, show Goody.

01:06:44.978 --> 01:06:46.377
Oh.

01:06:46.412 --> 01:06:50.178
So my father decided
to give me this.

01:06:50.216 --> 01:06:51.774
Hmm.
That's weird.

01:06:51.818 --> 01:06:53.149
Oh, careful.
It's got silver bullets in it.

01:06:53.186 --> 01:06:54.881
(gasps)

01:06:54.921 --> 01:06:57.151
Stacy:
What's he thinking?

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.090
He's got more paranoid

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.683
since he saw the footage
from the hospital.

01:07:00.727 --> 01:07:02.592
What footage?

01:07:02.629 --> 01:07:05.655
This guy just seemed to fly
from a cab to the front door.

01:07:05.698 --> 01:07:07.188
I'm such an idiot.

01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:09.599
Why didn't I look
for surveillance cameras?

01:07:09.636 --> 01:07:11.604
- Wait a minute, you...
- No, no. We didn't do anything.

01:07:11.638 --> 01:07:14.368
It was...
it was our stem, Cisserus.

01:07:14.407 --> 01:07:16.637
She's a monster.

01:07:16.676 --> 01:07:18.735
She's gonna louse it up
for all of us.

01:07:18.778 --> 01:07:21.246
Don't trip.
We'll talk to Tepish.

01:07:21.281 --> 01:07:23.715
Oh, I saw him after work

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.615
and he said
you'll be feeling better soon.

01:07:25.652 --> 01:07:27.142
You're just pregnant.

01:07:27.186 --> 01:07:29.916
(laughing)
- What?

01:07:29.956 --> 01:07:32.015
- I'm pregnant?
- We're gonna have a baby.

01:07:32.058 --> 01:07:33.753
I'm pregnant!

01:07:33.793 --> 01:07:35.522
Stacy:
Oh, my God!

01:07:35.562 --> 01:07:37.291
Oh, I can't believe this.
I'm pregnant?

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:39.025
You want a baby?

01:07:39.065 --> 01:07:40.896
Well...

01:07:40.934 --> 01:07:43.232
yeah.

01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:45.737
I'm over 40. How many more
chances am I gonna get?

01:07:45.772 --> 01:07:47.262
And besides,
I'll make a kick-ass father.

01:07:47.307 --> 01:07:48.831
(door opens, closes)
Renfield: - All right.

01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:51.173
Forget cell phones,
forget iPhones,

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:53.974
forget PowerBooks,
forget iPads.

01:07:54.013 --> 01:07:55.480
Goody:
Yay.

01:07:55.515 --> 01:07:58.313
Now I can do
everything I want

01:07:58.351 --> 01:08:00.216
with my iPad Mini.

01:08:00.253 --> 01:08:01.845
That looks just like your phone.

01:08:01.888 --> 01:08:03.651
But it doesn't make calls.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.590
I got my tweets,
I got my e-mails,

01:08:05.625 --> 01:08:07.217
I got my friends,
I got my alerts, I got...

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.160
So as the day progresses,
you can read

01:08:09.195 --> 01:08:11.561
thousands
of unsolicited messages,

01:08:11.598 --> 01:08:15.500
advertisements, and the mindless
brain vomit of acquaintances?

01:08:15.535 --> 01:08:17.399
Someone sounds hormonal.

01:08:17.437 --> 01:08:18.961
Maybe you're pregnant, too!

01:08:19.005 --> 01:08:20.939
(groans)
So annoying.

01:08:20.974 --> 01:08:23.636
You have to keep
learning to use new crap

01:08:23.676 --> 01:08:25.303
that doesn't actually
do anything better

01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:27.813
than the old crap, which is
incompatible with the new crap,

01:08:27.846 --> 01:08:30.680
all so you can have blogs
and watch fake teenagers

01:08:30.716 --> 01:08:32.377
and real housewives?

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:35.285
And it's all happening
too fast

01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:37.152
and I'm tired.

01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:41.149
I'm just sick
and tired of it all.

01:08:41.194 --> 01:08:43.822
Stacy:
It's okay.

01:08:43.863 --> 01:08:45.854
We don't have to get
the iPad Minis.

01:08:49.769 --> 01:08:51.167
No, I'm sorry...

01:08:51.203 --> 01:08:53.934
Look. Only a couple stations,
but they had Groucho Marx.

01:08:53.973 --> 01:08:55.964
No, that's not Groucho.

01:08:56.009 --> 01:08:57.499
Groucho was
the mustache guy.

01:08:57.542 --> 01:08:59.100
Joey:
Yeah, he had glasses and a cigar.

01:08:59.145 --> 01:09:01.045
Renfield:
Yeah, a cigar and glasses.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.877
You'll split $25 between you.
Are you ready?

01:09:02.915 --> 01:09:04.678
- Yes.
- Who is buried in Grant's Tomb?

01:09:04.716 --> 01:09:06.344
Were people
really that stupid?

01:09:06.386 --> 01:09:08.649
No, that's what he'd ask
when he felt bad

01:09:08.688 --> 01:09:10.279
and wanted to give 'em
a few bucks.

01:09:10.323 --> 01:09:11.984
Is Grant's Tomb
in New York?

01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:14.084
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:14.127 --> 01:09:15.651
Have any of you
ever been there?

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:17.629
- No.
- No.

01:09:17.663 --> 01:09:20.497
- That's it.
Stacy: - What?

01:09:20.533 --> 01:09:24.299
God, the place
no New Yorker ever goes.

01:09:24.337 --> 01:09:26.600
Of course, Cisserus would
want a monument.

01:09:26.639 --> 01:09:28.197
And it's gota tomb

01:09:28.241 --> 01:09:30.037
Oh, my God.
You're probably right.

01:09:30.076 --> 01:09:31.542
Come on.

01:09:34.413 --> 01:09:36.006
- Show me again.
- Yeah, here.

01:09:36.049 --> 01:09:38.415
I guess I totally can tell,
but it's...

01:09:38.451 --> 01:09:40.078
it's like, I don't know.
I always thought you'd be

01:09:40.118 --> 01:09:41.848
the first one to have a baby.
Is that weird?

01:09:41.888 --> 01:09:43.377
- But now that it's happening...
- Listen.

01:09:43.423 --> 01:09:46.551
You have to decide something
independent of me or Joey.

01:09:46.591 --> 01:09:49.857
This baby won't survive
in your condition.

01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:52.261
If you want it,
you have to turn back.

01:09:52.298 --> 01:09:53.822
How does that even...

01:09:53.866 --> 01:09:55.527
Cisserus would have
to be killed.

01:09:55.568 --> 01:09:57.092
That's right.

01:09:57.136 --> 01:10:00.264
I'd be in my '40s.

01:10:00.306 --> 01:10:01.796
But I'd be a mom.

01:10:03.543 --> 01:10:06.944
- You'd be older, too.
- I know.

01:10:06.979 --> 01:10:08.503
I can't decide
for the both of us.

01:10:08.548 --> 01:10:12.211
How do you feel about
not being young anymore?

01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:13.741
Which part...

01:10:13.786 --> 01:10:16.584
running around to clubs
and dating idiots?

01:10:16.622 --> 01:10:19.557
Would be nice not to
have to fake all the references.

01:10:19.592 --> 01:10:21.184
- Ugh.
- Like acting nostalgic over

01:10:21.227 --> 01:10:23.559
"Hey, Arnold" instead of
"Happy Days."

01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:25.962
Not to mention
the slang, "BTW."

01:10:25.998 --> 01:10:27.659
And the clothes
and the music.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.498
Staying young is getting old.

01:10:30.536 --> 01:10:33.699
Plus, we'll have a baby.

01:10:35.842 --> 01:10:38.606
What are we even talking about?
We can't kill Cisserus.

01:10:38.644 --> 01:10:40.441
She's lasted hundreds of years.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.744
But that's because
nobody knew where she was.

01:10:42.782 --> 01:10:44.010
But she's very sturdy.

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:46.348
And let's face it,
we're wimps.

01:10:46.385 --> 01:10:49.786
Yeah, but she's sloppy.
And conceited.

01:10:49.822 --> 01:10:51.289
And we'll call in
the heavy-hitters.

01:10:51.324 --> 01:10:52.689
Who?

01:10:52.725 --> 01:10:54.852
Your future father-in-law.

01:10:54.894 --> 01:10:57.158
(laughs)

01:10:57.196 --> 01:11:00.098
I just have to do
one thing first.

01:11:00.099 --> 01:11:02.363
You said for a little more time,
you'd do anything.

01:11:02.401 --> 01:11:04.926
- Did you mean it?
- Of course, but what can I do?

01:11:04.971 --> 01:11:06.939
Would you change your schedule
and stay up later

01:11:06.973 --> 01:11:09.237
and promise to let her
only have animals?

01:11:09.275 --> 01:11:12.005
Now, wait a minute.
Can you keep her alive?

01:11:12.044 --> 01:11:15.343
- Not exactly alive.
- But not dead?

01:11:15.381 --> 01:11:17.906
I can't but he can.

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:20.111
- It's up to you.
- Yeah.

01:11:20.153 --> 01:11:22.451
Yeah, I can't lose her.

01:11:26.292 --> 01:11:29.125
I need privacy to do this.

01:11:32.265 --> 01:11:34.699
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

01:11:34.734 --> 01:11:37.760

01:11:37.804 --> 01:11:40.295

That's enough.
It doesn't take that long.

01:12:49.075 --> 01:12:51.168
(growls)

01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:01.416
Your wife is very sweet.

01:13:03.456 --> 01:13:06.118
- Yeah.
- So, uh...

01:13:06.158 --> 01:13:08.217
I am just wondering,

01:13:08.261 --> 01:13:10.923
are you guys
getting along, or, uh...

01:13:10.963 --> 01:13:13.557
any chance of breaking up
in the future?

01:13:16.969 --> 01:13:18.459
Danny.

01:13:25.945 --> 01:13:27.606
Thank you.

01:13:27.647 --> 01:13:29.877
You're welcome.

01:13:38.157 --> 01:13:41.126
(knock on door)
Goody: - Come on, open up.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.185
- Who's there?
- I'm a friend of your son.

01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:46.221
- I wanna help you.
- You want to help me?

01:13:46.265 --> 01:13:49.029
I've got some news
for you, Grandpa.

01:13:54.073 --> 01:13:55.768
Did you say Grandpa?

01:13:57.276 --> 01:13:59.801
(music playing)

01:14:01.013 --> 01:14:04.505
I thought all victims
turned into vampires or died.

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:07.041
I've never heard of anyone
turning back.

01:14:07.086 --> 01:14:08.883
Well, I've never known
anyone firsthand.

01:14:08.921 --> 01:14:11.617
But apparently,
if you're young enough...

01:14:11.657 --> 01:14:13.420
those are useless on a stem.

01:14:16.529 --> 01:14:20.829
Are you really sure this isn't just
Joey's rebelliousness?

01:14:20.866 --> 01:14:23.630
I mean,
do they seem serious?

01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:26.263
Well, I've never seen Stacy
like this before.

01:14:26.305 --> 01:14:28.364
And he's so excited
to be a dad.

01:14:28.407 --> 01:14:31.137
I believe
they really are in love.

01:14:31.177 --> 01:14:33.077
When did you awaken?

01:14:33.112 --> 01:14:34.739
1841.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.078
I survived a feeding
and begged her to turn me.

01:14:37.116 --> 01:14:39.209
You wanted
to become a vampire?

01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:41.981
It was the lesser
of two infections.

01:14:42.021 --> 01:14:44.455
In 1840, there was
an epidemic of cholera

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:45.980
in lower Manhattan.

01:14:46.025 --> 01:14:49.051
It was a painful
and degrading death.

01:14:49.095 --> 01:14:51.757
My husband and sisters
had all passed.

01:14:51.797 --> 01:14:55.062
But, miraculously,
my children were fine.

01:14:55.101 --> 01:14:58.969
Not to be indelicate,
but I had digestive rumblings

01:14:59.005 --> 01:15:00.768
that I knew were
the early symptoms,

01:15:00.806 --> 01:15:03.673
and orphans did not fare well
in those days.

01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:05.734
So did your kids survive?

01:15:05.778 --> 01:15:09.771
My son lived
to the ripe old age of 63.

01:15:09.815 --> 01:15:12.409
And my daughter
married Peter Meester,

01:15:12.451 --> 01:15:14.612
and lived to be 99.

01:15:14.653 --> 01:15:16.644
Unprecedented at the time.

01:15:16.689 --> 01:15:19.283
Well, not many elderly people
had strong young mothers

01:15:19.325 --> 01:15:20.815
to look out for them.

01:15:22.428 --> 01:15:24.726
After the grandchildren,
it would've been hard

01:15:24.764 --> 01:15:26.789
to stay in their lives
and not scare them.

01:15:28.334 --> 01:15:29.528
(intercom clicks)

01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:31.832
- Did you get that?
Rita: - Got it.

01:15:31.871 --> 01:15:35.637
You know, the only surefire
way is to behead her.

01:15:35.674 --> 01:15:39.405
Everything else might
just piss her off.

01:15:39.445 --> 01:15:41.379
And when Cisserus is dead,

01:15:41.414 --> 01:15:44.247
Stacy will be a normal girl.

01:15:44.283 --> 01:15:47.218
Normal for Stacy.

01:15:47.253 --> 01:15:50.586
But, what happens
to you, then?

01:15:52.024 --> 01:15:54.288
I saved my kids.

01:15:54.326 --> 01:15:55.850
Let's go save yours.

01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:59.523
Here you go.
Here's your family tree.

01:16:02.034 --> 01:16:03.831
Your living descendants.

01:16:03.869 --> 01:16:07.168
A great-great-great-great grandson.

01:16:07.206 --> 01:16:10.539
A drug addict.
Incarcerated.

01:16:10.576 --> 01:16:15.309
Four doctors.
One in Doctors Without Borders.

01:16:15.347 --> 01:16:17.781
Two professors,
four teachers,

01:16:17.817 --> 01:16:19.808
and in the House
of Representatives,

01:16:19.852 --> 01:16:22.787
Jane Rutherford,
who chairs several committees.

01:16:22.822 --> 01:16:24.449
She looks like you.

01:16:26.158 --> 01:16:27.648
Thank you.

01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:31.289
All right,
leave the guns.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:34.265
Bring the axes,
hatchets, blades.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.134
All right, let's go get
this dried up bitch.

01:16:40.272 --> 01:16:42.365
Well, I don't go
to those places much, either.

01:16:42.408 --> 01:16:45.468
But it just shows you can meet
someone really nice.

01:16:45.511 --> 01:16:48.002
Well, I never go
to those places, so...

01:16:48.047 --> 01:16:49.947
I can't believe
I met you, though.

01:16:49.982 --> 01:16:52.883
- You are beautiful.
- You're so sweet.

01:16:52.918 --> 01:16:54.408
(laughs)

01:16:54.453 --> 01:16:57.320
- Would you like to sit?
- Oh, would I?

01:16:59.191 --> 01:17:02.183
- Nice here.
- Isn't it?

01:17:02.228 --> 01:17:04.526
Oh.

01:17:04.563 --> 01:17:06.724
Isn't your wife
worried about

01:17:06.765 --> 01:17:08.665
where you are so late?

01:17:08.701 --> 01:17:11.898
She's on a trip and what she
don't know won't hurt her.

01:17:14.306 --> 01:17:16.501
Aren't you a bad boy?

01:17:16.542 --> 01:17:18.976
I can be very bad.

01:17:19.011 --> 01:17:22.469
So what does a dirty boy
like you do for a living?

01:17:22.515 --> 01:17:24.312
I'm a dentist.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:27.012
You're a dentist?

01:17:27.052 --> 01:17:29.020
What a lucky break.

01:17:29.054 --> 01:17:31.284
Because I have something
I'm really concerned about.

01:17:31.323 --> 01:17:33.086
Can I show you?

01:17:36.929 --> 01:17:40.695
I've never seen anything
like that in my...

01:17:40.733 --> 01:17:43.702
(growling)
- Oh, no! No!

01:17:43.736 --> 01:17:45.636
(screaming)

01:17:47.573 --> 01:17:49.734
Run!
Get out of here!

01:17:53.012 --> 01:17:54.741
You asshole.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.509
Let's go.

01:18:04.256 --> 01:18:05.553
(grunts)

01:18:05.591 --> 01:18:07.388
You bad girls.

01:18:07.426 --> 01:18:09.986
I am very
disappointed in you.

01:18:10.029 --> 01:18:12.589
After all
I've done for you,

01:18:12.631 --> 01:18:15.623
this is how you pay me back?

01:18:15.668 --> 01:18:16.828
(screams)

01:18:16.869 --> 01:18:19.030
(girls scream)
Goody: - Are you okay?

01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:21.130
Who treats
their stem like this?

01:18:24.376 --> 01:18:26.776
(clicks)
(Van Helsing laughs)

01:18:26.812 --> 01:18:28.780
Those needed gunpowder!

01:18:32.218 --> 01:18:34.243
(growling)

01:18:34.286 --> 01:18:35.583
(groaning)

01:18:38.324 --> 01:18:40.258
Joey: Duck!

01:18:40.292 --> 01:18:42.624
(screaming)

01:18:45.598 --> 01:18:47.065
Oh, my God.
We did it.

01:18:47.099 --> 01:18:50.068
No. You guys, we have
to get her into the tomb.

01:18:50.102 --> 01:18:51.501
- Help me.
- Okay, okay.

01:18:51.537 --> 01:18:54.267
Argh.

01:18:54.306 --> 01:18:56.467
When did my ass
get so flat?

01:19:00.379 --> 01:19:02.574
Can I just say... ow!

01:19:06.719 --> 01:19:08.209
Wait... what are we gonna do
about the body?

01:19:08.254 --> 01:19:09.585
Oh, it'll die in a minute.

01:19:09.622 --> 01:19:11.021
Where were you?

01:19:11.056 --> 01:19:12.853
What? You asked me
to get a chainsaw.

01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:14.882
I get halfway here
and realize it needs gasoline.

01:19:14.927 --> 01:19:17.327
Do you know where to get gasoline
at 4:00 in the morning?

01:19:17.363 --> 01:19:18.921
Why didn't you get it
where you got the saw?

01:19:18.964 --> 01:19:20.659
Because I thought
you plugged them in.

01:19:20.699 --> 01:19:21.927
What am I, a lumberjack?

01:19:21.967 --> 01:19:24.231
In the forest,
you're plugging things in?

01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:26.670
- Yes, like a hairdryer or a...

You've aged 20 years?

01:20:29.735 --> 01:20:32.670
Well, I didn't drink, smoke,
do drugs, or sunbathe.

01:20:32.705 --> 01:20:34.104
(laughs)

01:20:39.578 --> 01:20:43.241
Oh, well, maybe your genes
just aren't as good.

01:20:43.282 --> 01:20:45.716
But with Botox
and laser resurfacing...

01:20:49.154 --> 01:20:51.281
Don't tell me you lied
about your age.

01:20:51.323 --> 01:20:52.756
Oh, come on.

01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:55.351
Who the hell names their kid
Goody anymore?

01:20:58.330 --> 01:21:00.389
You won't get
any older, will you?

01:21:00.432 --> 01:21:01.990
It's okay.

01:21:02.034 --> 01:21:04.059
I've been around
long enough.

01:21:04.103 --> 01:21:05.730
I'm tired.

01:21:06.939 --> 01:21:08.770
I should've known.

01:21:08.807 --> 01:21:10.741
Every time I turned on
the History Channel,

01:21:10.776 --> 01:21:12.767
all I saw was stuff
about Hitler.

01:21:14.179 --> 01:21:17.148
Don't be sad. I was gonna go
into the sun before I met you.

01:21:17.182 --> 01:21:19.275
You showed me
how to have fun.

01:21:27.559 --> 01:21:29.288
Is there anything you want?

01:21:29.328 --> 01:21:30.727
Yes.

01:21:30.763 --> 01:21:32.628
I don't wanna be here.

01:21:32.664 --> 01:21:34.962
I want to be
in the center of things.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.831
Let's go.

01:21:48.046 --> 01:21:49.809
You all right?

01:22:02.194 --> 01:22:05.595
You all right?
How do you feel?

01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:07.394
Hungry.

01:22:07.433 --> 01:22:10.334
How about one of those
pretzel things?

01:22:10.369 --> 01:22:12.098
Joey, can you go get
one of those pretzel things?

01:22:12.137 --> 01:22:13.968
- Of course.
- Thanks.
