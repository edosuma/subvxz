03:13.960 --> 03:15.723
The stones!

05:26.759 --> 05:30.422
We have failed in our duty...

05:30.496 --> 05:32.259
the Armageddon.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.459
We saved two of the stones.

05:34.534 --> 05:37.526
The amulet...
does she still wear it?

05:37.603 --> 05:42.006
- It is gone.
- His birth is still to come...

05:42.241 --> 05:45.802
and the battle is still
to be fought.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.926
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;

06:00.993 --> 06:03.393
Too like the lightning,
which doth cease to be...

06:03.463 --> 06:06.455
Ere one can say ''It lightens.''
Sweet good night...

06:06.532 --> 06:09.262
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath

06:09.335 --> 06:11.963
May prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.969
Good night, good night!
as sweet repose and rest

06:15.208 --> 06:17.904
Come to thy heart
as that within my breast.

06:17.977 --> 06:20.880
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.178
What satisfaction canst
thou have to-night?

06:23.249 --> 06:25.877
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.318
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it:

06:28.388 --> 06:31.516
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

06:31.591 --> 06:32.922
Whoa!

06:34.026 --> 06:35.618
Travis!?

06:35.695 --> 06:36.719
Sir?

06:38.431 --> 06:40.956
I cannot work under
these conditions.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.365
Go on, go home.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.631
Same time tomorrow.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.900
I think what Shakespeare
meant was...

06:51.978 --> 06:54.469
we should seize the moment.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.572
I don't think so, Andy.

07:02.855 --> 07:04.846
Travis?

07:07.794 --> 07:10.194
We've got to talk.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.528
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, hon.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.506
Oh, let's get out of here.

07:20.506 --> 07:23.339
- Good evening, Reverend.
- Hey, Andy.

07:23.409 --> 07:26.276
You taking Samantha
to the movies this weekend?

07:26.345 --> 07:28.745
- Yeah, I'd like to.
- Bye, Andy.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.942
We'll see ya soon, Andy.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.451
Okay. Take care.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.642
Listen good, Devil boy.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.877
Samantha doesn't want
anything to do with you.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.681
Her father doesn't
want you near her...

08:07.753 --> 08:11.314
and I don't want your Satanic ass
within a hundred yards of her.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.221
- You got that?
- Lay off, Andy.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.260
Look at this,
still reading comics.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.455
Bet you wish you were a
superhero now, huh?

08:17.530 --> 08:20.328
Kenny, the mutant crusader
and the ex-wimps.

08:20.399 --> 08:22.697
- Back off, Andy.
- Come on.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.671
- I'm serious.
- Show me your powers.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.696
Oh, shit!

08:27.773 --> 08:30.936
- Don't just stand there.
- Butthead.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.922
(thunder clap)

08:59.906 --> 09:01.806
(wind howling)

09:39.845 --> 09:42.609
The sign of his birth.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.298
Woman's voice:
What are you doing still home?

10:10.409 --> 10:12.900
Well, you're gonna be late.

10:12.979 --> 10:16.278
No, that's going to be a surprise.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.874
Now, hurry up or
you'll miss the eclipse.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.748
(hangs up phone)

10:21.821 --> 10:24.949
Now, Obelisk, I need your opinion.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.015
Do you think he'll like this?

10:27.259 --> 10:29.750
Bark once for yes and...
(growling)

10:29.829 --> 10:33.560
Hmm, a growl, huh?
You probably need glasses anyway.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.568
Now where did I put
grandma's necklace?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.571
Here it is.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.540
Hey, it is our only family heirloom.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.003
What do you think
he'll think about this?

12:28.914 --> 12:30.404
Obelisk, no.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.278
Stay away.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.525
(yelping)

13:27.039 --> 13:30.531
Don't you want to give
your boy a kiss, mother?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.966
Let me in, mother.
Let me in.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.228
Fuck you!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.897
(screams)

14:49.755 --> 14:52.417
Boy: You're up late.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.652
You too.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.457
I heard you making coffee.

14:57.529 --> 15:01.397
Sorry, look, it's fresh, hot...
Why don't you have a cup?

15:01.467 --> 15:03.662
I've got school tomorrow.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.668
Afraid you'll lose?

15:04.737 --> 15:05.761
No.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.706
Then, come on. Sit down and
let's finish this one last game.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.265
(sighs)

15:13.412 --> 15:16.381
Dad, I'm gonna come home
for holidays and stuff.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.746
I know, but...
let's play.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.557
It's your move.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.726
Oh, yeah. Right.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.532
Dad...

15:40.606 --> 15:42.301
Nice move.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.803
Are you okay, dad?

15:49.548 --> 15:52.381
Sure. It must be
the moon or something.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.476
You thinking about mom?

15:54.553 --> 15:57.215
She would have been
real proud of you, son.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.784
Is there something
you want to tell me, dad?

16:01.860 --> 16:03.691
Yeah...

16:05.464 --> 16:07.523
I love you, Kenny.

16:23.449 --> 16:27.749
(distorted voice) You were born
at my grace to serve only me.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.220
What does that command?

16:30.289 --> 16:33.292
There are five stones
like the one she wears.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.351
You must possess them all.

16:35.427 --> 16:37.486
Thy will be done.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.499
You will have six days
to complete my task.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.662
When the sun emerges
from the darkness...

16:43.736 --> 16:46.227
your time will pass.

16:46.305 --> 16:49.240
She, the force creator
shall guide you.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.558
(buzzer sounds)

17:45.664 --> 17:47.222
Surprise!

17:48.667 --> 17:50.294
Who the hell are you?

17:53.439 --> 17:55.339
Mmmm... black.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.710
(horns honking, tires squealing)

18:06.785 --> 18:09.151
What are you,
some kind of idiot?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.450
(laughing)
It's the devil.

18:15.694 --> 18:19.255
Hey, buddy, you must have
bricks for balls...

18:19.331 --> 18:21.697
or you must be
one stupid yuppie.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.632
Is this your carriage?

18:23.702 --> 18:26.728
Yeah, this is my carriage.

18:26.805 --> 18:29.968
I wish to be transported
to Chicago.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.507
Get the fuck out
of my face, blondie.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.337
I like you, Hector.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.953
Hey, sweetheart,
I missed you last night.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.798
...this boy from Spokane...

18:55.868 --> 18:58.803
...threw his second
no-hitter this season.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.339
The Giant's ain't
going to bring him up early.

19:01.406 --> 19:05.638
But I say, hell, take the diaper off
him and let him pitch.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.709
Well...

19:09.781 --> 19:11.578
Good evening, friends.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.741
Doesn't necessarily mean
what you think.

19:36.808 --> 19:39.276
I know exactly what it means.

19:45.584 --> 19:48.348
Diving for shells,
you show-off?

19:48.420 --> 19:51.651
- I didn't know you were here.
- You're not supposed to.

19:54.293 --> 19:55.658
A spy...
(chuckles)

19:55.727 --> 19:58.195
You know what we do with spies?

19:58.263 --> 19:59.753
Don't touch me.

19:59.831 --> 20:03.426
No, please. No!
I don't want to get wet, Kenny.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.231
No! I hate you!

20:05.304 --> 20:07.738
- I don't think you hate me.
- Yes, I do. I hate you.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.438
I've got something to brag about.

20:13.512 --> 20:17.209
I tried to tell you last night
but you bolted out of there so fast.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.307
I know, my dad picked me up.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.718
- I know... I saw him.
- So, brag.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.585
Guess what I'm going
to be doing this summer?

20:25.657 --> 20:29.525
You got the job.
Oh, that's great.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.654
I'm going to have
everything set up for us

20:31.730 --> 20:33.789
by the time you're ready
to start Berkeley.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.634
You'll get accepted,
I'm not worried.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.832
Man's voice:
The trees shall be torn in half.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.467
The birds shall be severed
from the sky.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.841
The water shall turn red
as death.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.403
The maggots shall seek
the light.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.574
And within the heart of each...

20:51.650 --> 20:53.880
lay the icons of our
destruction.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.455
(radio broadcast)
...there have been some
military conflicts...

21:04.529 --> 21:06.498
...three plane crashes...
(radio changing frequency)

21:06.498 --> 21:08.363
...riots in the street of Tokyo...
(changing)

21:08.433 --> 21:10.628
...last night,
police in Manhattan...

21:10.702 --> 21:13.000
...reported violent crimes were up
seventy-five percent...

21:13.238 --> 21:16.298
...the succession of incidents has
prompted a number of star watchers

21:16.408 --> 21:19.707
to draw a correlation between these
events and last night's lunar eclipse...

21:26.051 --> 21:29.214
The warlock is here, ain't he?

21:31.690 --> 21:34.454
So much for my
seventieth birthday.

21:37.496 --> 21:40.488
Well, you know we'll have
to talk with...

21:40.565 --> 21:43.466
No! The reverend's not
one of us anymore.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.469
It's been a while since
I took a road trip.

21:45.537 --> 21:46.299
What for?

21:46.371 --> 21:48.839
There's only one way to stop
a warlock, you know that.

21:48.907 --> 21:51.375
- It's how we always planned it.
- I know, but...

21:51.443 --> 21:53.377
I'm just going to get in
his way a little.

21:53.445 --> 21:57.438
If we can slow the son-of-a-bitch
down we might have a chance.

22:02.954 --> 22:06.856
This Asgardian compass
will reveal a path to the warlock.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.230
We have something to do.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.228
I've been thinking a lot, Kenny.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.923
I'm just not sure anymore.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.795
What? Wait a minute.
I thought we talked about this.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.335
- I know.
- I thought we had it all planned.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.895
- Well, I changed my mind.
- Is it because of Andy?

22:54.973 --> 22:57.533
No! I'm just not ready
to leave Logan Valley.

22:57.609 --> 23:00.373
Why? I mean, what
do you have here without me?

23:00.445 --> 23:01.912
My dad, for one.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.813
He needs me.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.716
I don't want to stay here
the rest of my life.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.881
I mean, I want to go...

23:11.957 --> 23:14.585
...just not yet.
I need more time.

23:14.659 --> 23:17.219
Well, I don't have
any more time.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.854
All my life I've heard what people
have said about my dad.

23:19.931 --> 23:25.233
And all he tells me is people live
in fear of what they don't understand.

23:25.303 --> 23:27.601
I don't understand what that means.

23:27.672 --> 23:30.470
I'm going to San Francisco...

23:30.542 --> 23:33.238
with or without you.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.577
I'm sorry.

23:36.648 --> 23:37.842
Yeah.

23:37.916 --> 23:41.682
Oh, don't do that.
I'm just confused.

23:41.753 --> 23:45.314
I just have this feeling
this is where I belong.

23:55.534 --> 23:56.796
(silence)

23:59.404 --> 24:00.735
The birds.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.740
What about 'em?

24:02.808 --> 24:04.901
There aren't any.

24:18.857 --> 24:21.257
Ah, great.

24:22.527 --> 24:25.291
Sam... it's just my dad.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.480
You're scaring me, dad.

24:50.789 --> 24:52.586
Talk to me.

24:54.759 --> 24:56.386
I love you, Kenny.

25:16.281 --> 25:20.581
Hurry up! He's going to look
like aged old lettuce.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.633
- Don't shoot!
- Kenny, calm down.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.231
Calm down?

26:19.377 --> 26:21.212
No, no, no.
Don't touch me.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.544
- It's true.
- What's the matter with you?

26:23.615 --> 26:25.708
Everything they said about you.
It's all true.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.344
Come here.
What's the matter with you, boy?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.320
Calm down!

26:30.388 --> 26:32.379
I don't want anything to do with
any devil worshiping.

26:32.457 --> 26:35.551
Devil worship?
What the hell's wrong with you?

26:35.627 --> 26:37.652
Dead for half an inning and

26:37.729 --> 26:40.357
you're back at the plate
with half a screw loose.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.366
Frank, stop.
You're gonna kill him again.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.628
You killed me?

26:43.702 --> 26:45.727
Why did you kill me, dad?

26:45.804 --> 26:47.965
You're not dead, son.

26:50.241 --> 26:52.801
Kenny, just give us
a chance to explain.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.556
(techno music playing)

29:01.706 --> 29:03.435
Oh, one more thing...

29:03.508 --> 29:04.907
tell Laura to stop
swaying her hips so much.

29:05.176 --> 29:06.768
She looks like a slut.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.712
This area is off limits
until after the show.

29:09.781 --> 29:12.682
Look, what ever it is,
it's going to have to wait.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.481
I'm interested in
one of your pieces.

29:15.553 --> 29:18.750
You don't look like the kind of man
who would wear a dress.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.916
Jewelry, perhaps.

29:20.992 --> 29:24.393
Ancient, my favorite.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.259
Perfect choice.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.231
It's not for sale.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.358
I have no intention
of buying it.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.300
You're going to steal it?

29:32.370 --> 29:35.635
You're going to give it to me...
freely and willingly.

29:35.707 --> 29:36.969
Those are the rules.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.540
Men have no rules.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.580
I'm not a man...
I'm a witch.

29:42.647 --> 29:45.844
- A warlock.
- You mock me.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.654
You still doubt me?

29:50.722 --> 29:54.385
That you're really Merlin?
Maybe just a bit.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.450
I can prove it.

29:59.497 --> 30:02.591
All right,
cast a spell or something...

30:02.667 --> 30:05.465
and I might consider
giving you the stone.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.404
- How's that for a deal?
- Follow me.

30:12.010 --> 30:16.470
Take over for me, darling.
I think I'm in love.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.384
Well?

30:55.453 --> 30:59.856
I reveal my power,
you give me the stone.

30:59.924 --> 31:02.256
That's the deal.

31:02.327 --> 31:05.592
Faust would be proud.

31:05.663 --> 31:07.756
Take my hand.

31:09.801 --> 31:13.862
Are you going to turn me
into a frog or something?

31:13.938 --> 31:15.735
Something much better.

31:15.807 --> 31:17.468
(woman gasps)

31:22.380 --> 31:26.874
I can smell fear and excitement
dripping from your every pour.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.916
Do you wish to go higher?

31:32.991 --> 31:35.551
I...I can't.

31:37.929 --> 31:39.954
I don't...yes.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.468
Do you believe me now?

31:52.543 --> 31:54.477
Yes. Yes.

31:54.545 --> 31:56.536
The stone.

31:58.383 --> 31:59.850
Here, take it.

32:03.454 --> 32:05.217
Ride's over.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.315
(screaming)

32:07.392 --> 32:10.919
And now, it is my pleasure
to present to you...

32:10.995 --> 32:13.759
Miss Paula Dare.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.367
Paula?

32:35.987 --> 32:38.387
Kenny: You mean to tell me
that the devil is

32:38.456 --> 32:40.447
trapped in some kind of prison
that we call hell

32:40.525 --> 32:43.255
and every 6-7OO years
gets the chance to escape?

32:43.328 --> 32:45.262
I told you,
first there's a lunar eclipse...

32:45.363 --> 32:47.593
then six days later
there's a solar eclipse.

32:47.665 --> 32:50.600
Yes, and during that time
God's out of rotation.

32:50.668 --> 32:53.330
And if the devil's child,
the warlock...

32:53.404 --> 32:55.338
succeeds in releasing his daddy...

32:55.406 --> 32:57.601
the whole damn planet
is shit out of luck.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.200
You mean,
like the end of the world?

33:04.248 --> 33:06.512
We're druids, guardians...

33:06.584 --> 33:09.417
God gave us certain gifts.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.690
They're for one purpose...

33:13.791 --> 33:15.759
to stop the Armageddon.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.622
Runestones...

33:19.697 --> 33:22.962
They have the power
to free the devil.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.229
Or to keep him trapped
where he belongs.

33:25.303 --> 33:26.702
It's a world of magic, son...

33:26.771 --> 33:29.239
where nothing
is what it seems to be.

33:30.408 --> 33:33.434
The trees talk,
the birds whisper...

33:33.511 --> 33:35.413
if you know how to listen.

33:35.413 --> 33:37.278
I just don't get why
you had to shoot me.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.838
That's enough for now.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.713
Uh...uh...

33:40.785 --> 33:42.980
Come on, boy,
let's get some breakfast.

33:43.054 --> 33:46.387
Getting killed can build up
a whale of an appetite.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.787
Well, we're gonna have
to tell him. All of it.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.916
These good people are concerned.

34:19.991 --> 34:23.654
They believe you may have had
something to do with this.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.628
Well, Reverend?

34:25.696 --> 34:28.563
I believe that...

34:28.632 --> 34:31.761
...birds die.

34:31.835 --> 34:35.533
Probably an insecticide.

34:35.606 --> 34:39.337
- Maybe some kind of pollution.
- An act of God.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.844
No! This is your fault.
You're all a bunch of freaks.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.972
(man yelling)
We want an explanation.

34:44.047 --> 34:45.242
People, please.

34:45.315 --> 34:46.943
Who's going be next,
our children?

34:47.018 --> 34:49.213
That's enough.

34:49.286 --> 34:53.382
The birds are dead.
That's all we know here.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.291
There's no one to blame.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.261
Now just go back to
what you were doing.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.389
All of you. Go on.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.165
You're good with crowds,
Reverend.

35:09.240 --> 35:12.676
They were just scared.
The birds scared them.

35:12.743 --> 35:15.713
Think how frightened they'd be
if you told them the truth.

35:15.713 --> 35:19.843
What truth?
A few birds died, that's all.

35:19.917 --> 35:22.977
Come on, Ted, you know
it's one of the signs.

35:23.221 --> 35:24.813
Rev: I don't want to hear it.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.449
- He's got to
be coming for the stones.

35:27.525 --> 35:31.518
Rev: It's superstitious nonsense.
Just grow up.

35:31.596 --> 35:34.292
''The birds shall be
severed from the sky.''

35:34.365 --> 35:36.424
Remember those words, Ted?

35:40.805 --> 35:43.330
The icon of our destruction.

35:48.846 --> 35:50.336
Samantha...

35:51.415 --> 35:53.212
Sam...

36:05.997 --> 36:08.830
Two down, four to go.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.544
Fill 'er up?

36:29.353 --> 36:32.481
What, did you take a wrong
turn at Albuquerque?

36:36.027 --> 36:38.188
(chuckles)
New Yorkers.

36:44.902 --> 36:47.462
It isn't going to work, Franks.

36:47.538 --> 36:51.440
Only warriors can kill the warlock.
And even they need the dagger.

36:53.578 --> 36:58.242
Will, this scroll I found says
there's a spell that will hurt him.

36:58.316 --> 37:01.717
- An old wives tale.
- So are we.

37:01.786 --> 37:05.381
It says here that you
can damage a warlock.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.859
When you take a blue wooden pin...

37:09.927 --> 37:14.227
dipped in the ink of
mandrake juice...

37:14.298 --> 37:17.324
during the space of
the black light...

37:17.401 --> 37:22.270
mark this stone and
fix this curseth on thee...

37:22.340 --> 37:26.800
in the name of the four
fighters whose are...

37:26.877 --> 37:31.780
Ryl, Yok, Zar and Lod...

37:31.849 --> 37:36.286
who shall consume thee
as they are consumed.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.498
Hey, hey.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.741
Hey, mister... hey mister...

38:00.645 --> 38:03.341
I don't know how to tell you this...

38:03.414 --> 38:06.440
but he's dead.
Your taxi driver's dead.

38:08.419 --> 38:10.717
He's dead as disco.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.382
Is this vehicle fast?

38:13.457 --> 38:15.391
What are you talking about?

38:17.194 --> 38:19.628
I tell you,
you're wasting your time.

38:19.697 --> 38:22.791
Yeah, but just imagine.

38:31.375 --> 38:33.172
What's wrong, mister?

38:33.244 --> 38:34.973
Mister, what's going on?

38:45.956 --> 38:48.220
You're squirting blood
all over the place.

38:48.292 --> 38:51.728
It's black blood.
What do I do?

38:51.796 --> 38:54.526
Let's put our minds
to helping the boy.

38:54.598 --> 38:57.533
He's the one who has
to stop him, not us.

38:59.704 --> 39:02.935
Damn, I feel so damn helpless.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.607
Damn, damn, damn.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.220
I got to...
I got to get you to a hospital.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.949
You're losing a lot of blood.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.594
Then fill me up.

39:38.542 --> 39:42.740
The trees...
they're talking to me.

39:42.813 --> 39:45.782
I know, you'll get used to it.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.648
It's like they're chanting,
but I don't understand it.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.846
You will.

39:50.921 --> 39:53.253
Why me?

39:53.324 --> 39:56.760
Your birth, its timing.
It was a sign that...

39:56.827 --> 39:59.261
Of what?

39:59.330 --> 40:03.198
That you're not just a druid...
but a druid warrior.

40:04.268 --> 40:06.395
You mean,
like I have to fight?

40:06.470 --> 40:08.768
The son of Satan.

40:08.839 --> 40:11.239
Yeah, right, dad.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.643
I can't even fight
the school bully.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.545
You don't have a choice.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.312
I didn't ask you to shoot me.

40:21.385 --> 40:26.015
Like the Phoenix rising from the ashes,
the warrior rises from his own death.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.317
- That's the way it's written.
- Well, what else is written?

40:29.393 --> 40:31.987
That the warlock will
come for the stones.

40:32.062 --> 40:34.530
So, why don't we just
run with them?

40:34.598 --> 40:36.964
'Cause he'll find us
wherever we go.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.830
We have to stand and fight.

40:40.337 --> 40:42.532
This isn't what I want.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.234
I just want to go to
San Francisco with Sam.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.869
I just want to get out
of this town.

40:47.945 --> 40:52.882
In four days there won't be a town,
a San Francisco or anything else.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.918
Not unless you fight him.

40:54.985 --> 40:59.615
We were put on this earth
to be his guardians.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.452
If I had my way I'd trade places
with you in a heartbeat.

41:08.666 --> 41:12.568
Stay here, listen to the trees,
we'll start training in the morning.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.698
You keep him away from her.

41:40.698 --> 41:44.031
I don't want your son
around my daughter.

41:44.268 --> 41:46.828
There has to be two, Ted, two!

41:46.904 --> 41:50.237
- Good night.
- It's suicide if there isn't.

41:50.307 --> 41:51.968
You know that.

41:52.042 --> 41:55.808
This town's looking
for an excuse to burn you out.

41:55.880 --> 42:00.010
If he doesn't let her alone...
I'll give it to them.

42:12.563 --> 42:14.929
Ah, the wild west.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.307
I'm going to show you
the power of the druid.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.467
I don't think I want to see.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.477
All right, don't trust your eyes.

42:27.578 --> 42:30.012
Your worst enemy now
is what you see.

42:30.247 --> 42:32.875
It can make you weak,
it can take away your inner focus.

42:32.950 --> 42:35.248
You rely on what you can hear...

42:35.319 --> 42:39.255
not with your ears but in
your heart, right here.

42:39.323 --> 42:40.984
That's where the power really lies

42:41.058 --> 42:44.892
and when you find it,
just stand back and admire the show.

42:48.599 --> 42:50.499
Now close your eyes.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.594
Close your eyes,
now sense the ball.

42:53.671 --> 42:56.936
Feel it rise in the air.
Just sense it.

42:57.007 --> 42:59.999
Feel it rise.
Feel it, sense it.

43:05.883 --> 43:06.679
Look!

43:14.391 --> 43:15.824
Did I do that?

43:15.893 --> 43:18.259
Shall we try again?

43:46.957 --> 43:48.822
(loud pop)

44:00.938 --> 44:04.305
Um, I'll replace
the window in the morning.

44:04.375 --> 44:06.935
Don't...don't worry about it.

44:07.011 --> 44:10.777
Look, I'm sorry. You know, I...

44:10.848 --> 44:12.475
For what?

44:12.549 --> 44:14.813
Well, I'm letting you guys down.

44:14.885 --> 44:17.376
No, you're not letting us down.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.285
- Is he?
- No.

44:19.356 --> 44:22.484
Why don't you go get some rest?
We'll see you in the morning.

44:23.293 --> 44:24.988
Good night, dad.
Good night, Franks.

44:26.997 --> 44:29.591
We've got three days left.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.498
I know that.
I know that.

44:31.568 --> 44:35.334
Look, the kid's going to be fine.
He'll do it. I'm sure of.

44:35.406 --> 44:37.271
(loud crashing)

44:39.243 --> 44:41.245
Kenny: Sorry!

44:41.245 --> 44:44.806
I'm going to go find me
a nice burial spot.

44:49.953 --> 44:51.887
Good night, Will.

44:56.894 --> 45:01.298
Good bye, come again.

45:01.298 --> 45:04.199
Good night.

45:04.268 --> 45:07.203
We're your family.

45:17.748 --> 45:19.545
They are all gone.

45:20.918 --> 45:23.754
Sometimes I think you
actually are psychic.

45:23.754 --> 45:26.222
(laughing)
Yeah, right.

45:26.290 --> 45:28.588
You did fool those old bats
tonight, though.

45:28.659 --> 45:30.718
That's not a bad take.

45:33.931 --> 45:36.627
Buy yourself a big steak, huh?

45:48.245 --> 45:52.579
How can you have faith in a god
that cannot even control creation?

45:52.649 --> 45:55.413
How can he lead you to salvation?

45:55.486 --> 45:59.923
There is no hope in chaos,
only in order.

45:59.990 --> 46:04.324
Nice speech, buddy. But I've got
enough freaks in this side-show.

46:06.764 --> 46:09.392
I seek no employment...

46:09.466 --> 46:12.162
I've come for the stone.

46:14.938 --> 46:16.769
You're a buyer?

46:16.840 --> 46:18.865
A buyer...

46:18.942 --> 46:21.775
Well, why didn't you say so?

46:21.845 --> 46:25.781
Now, you do mean that rare
piece of Egyptian antiquity?

46:25.849 --> 46:29.717
That is a very valuable
and expensive item.

46:29.787 --> 46:33.314
It has great emotional and
material value.

46:37.861 --> 46:39.829
How much?

46:39.897 --> 46:42.297
Oh, I'd say at least...

46:44.334 --> 46:45.995
at least a hundred dollars.

46:46.236 --> 46:48.038
- What?
- Seventy-five.

46:48.038 --> 46:51.530
It's worth a thousand times that,
you cretinous fool.

46:57.781 --> 47:03.344
Do not sell to him the stone...
he is evil.

47:03.420 --> 47:06.821
The devil of Armageddon.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.191
You really are a psychic.

47:10.260 --> 47:13.855
Very good.
Very bad.

47:13.931 --> 47:15.626
(screams)

47:29.880 --> 47:32.212
Now, where were we?

47:32.282 --> 47:34.216
(ominous laughter)

47:45.629 --> 47:48.359
I'm here...
I'm everywhere.

47:48.432 --> 47:50.593
(laughing continues)

47:56.707 --> 47:57.935
Give me the stone.

47:58.008 --> 48:00.442
So you can kill me, too?

48:07.851 --> 48:09.682
(laughing intensifies)

48:13.423 --> 48:16.950
I see a mirror
when I look into a fool...

48:17.194 --> 48:19.685
but when I look into a mirror...

48:19.763 --> 48:21.560
I see a fool.
(laughing)

48:36.246 --> 48:39.841
Welcome to the other side
of reality.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.782
Where the hell am I?

48:41.852 --> 48:43.786
Check your pocket.

48:43.854 --> 48:46.379
I said, check your pocket!

48:47.791 --> 48:50.658
If you're so clever,
freak master...

48:50.727 --> 48:56.256
tell me which one is the real stone
and which the illusion.

48:56.333 --> 48:59.769
Guess correctly and
I'll let you live.

48:59.870 --> 49:03.431
If you're wrong,
then this is your eternity.

49:12.649 --> 49:15.709
You'll have to do
better than that.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.778
You don't think I don't know
the real from the fake?

49:27.698 --> 49:29.529
You lose, asshole.

49:38.709 --> 49:42.440
That depends on which side
of the mirror you're standing.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.652
(screaming)

50:27.057 --> 50:29.025
I knew I'd find you here.

50:29.259 --> 50:31.284
Make them stop.

50:31.361 --> 50:33.226
- What?
- The dreams.

50:33.296 --> 50:34.763
What dreams?

50:34.831 --> 50:37.664
I'm walking to school
and they're there.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.894
And then they're not.

50:40.971 --> 50:44.930
And I see you, Kenny,
and I'm calling your name.

50:45.008 --> 50:50.310
And this thing turns around and
it looks like an angel but it's not.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.245
It's evil.

50:52.315 --> 50:54.977
- They're just dreams.
- No, I'm awake.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.646
I keep seeing these letters...

50:57.721 --> 51:01.316
and symbols and
this great blackness...

51:01.391 --> 51:03.825
and daggers.
Why do I see daggers?

51:03.894 --> 51:08.194
- Am I going crazy?
- No, you're not going crazy.

51:08.265 --> 51:10.460
Then explain it to me.

51:10.534 --> 51:12.798
I can't.

51:12.869 --> 51:15.372
Please, please.

51:15.372 --> 51:17.704
Look, you wouldn't understand.

51:17.774 --> 51:20.208
Kenny? Kenny?

51:21.645 --> 51:23.636
Okay...

51:23.713 --> 51:26.375
Two days ago my dad shot me.

51:26.450 --> 51:27.784
Dead.

51:27.784 --> 51:31.413
And then he brought me back to life.
So now I'm this walking zombie

51:31.488 --> 51:34.252
who's supposed to save the
world from all the forces of evil.

51:35.992 --> 51:37.789
You don't look too impressed.

51:37.861 --> 51:40.489
You're really starting
to scare me, Kenny.

51:40.564 --> 51:41.929
(loud thunder)

51:45.402 --> 51:46.869
Quick, the bridge.

52:14.731 --> 52:16.528
It tastes like blood.

52:17.767 --> 52:20.793
Chalk by the water shall
turn red as death.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.831
How do I know that?
How do I know that?!

52:25.909 --> 52:28.605
- It's going to be okay, Sam.
- Stay away from me.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.777
Sam!

52:31.848 --> 52:33.475
Sammy!

52:35.819 --> 52:36.911
Shit!

53:06.416 --> 53:09.442
What about Sammy, dad?
Tell me about her.

53:11.821 --> 53:14.915
Look, Kenny, I know how much
you care for that girl.

53:14.991 --> 53:17.960
But right now you need
all your concentration.

53:18.028 --> 53:20.223
Everything else you can
work out later.

53:20.297 --> 53:21.423
Yeah, hopefully.

53:21.798 --> 53:24.596
Hey, why don't you fire
up that barbecue?

53:24.668 --> 53:26.898
- Dad?
- Just try.

53:45.388 --> 53:46.582
Hey, you did it.

53:46.656 --> 53:49.750
Your aim may need a little work.
But what the hell.

53:49.826 --> 53:51.919
I'll go get the hose.

53:56.032 --> 53:57.556
(bell tolls)

53:58.868 --> 54:01.632
I'll meet you all in the town
center tomorrow morning.

54:07.777 --> 54:11.679
Reverend, people like them
don't belong in our town.

54:11.748 --> 54:13.875
We all have to do our part.

54:13.950 --> 54:15.815
Good sermon.

54:18.388 --> 54:21.448
I'll be here in the morning and
so will all our neighbors.

54:21.524 --> 54:23.890
Thanks, Mrs. Wallace.
God bless.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.622
I'm with you... Reverend.
I want you to know that.

54:26.696 --> 54:28.630
Thank you, Buck,
you're a good man.

54:28.698 --> 54:30.723
See ya... tomorrow.

54:32.269 --> 54:33.896
Ted, I have to talk to you.

54:33.970 --> 54:37.804
Kate, I'm sorry you missed
my sermon.

54:37.874 --> 54:41.366
I heard enough.
Why are you doing this?

54:41.444 --> 54:45.540
It's something I should have
done a long time ago.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.708
You're really scared,
aren't you?

55:07.003 --> 55:09.494
This is the one thing that can
send the demon home.

55:15.912 --> 55:18.608
- What the hell is it?
- Son-of-a-bitch.

55:18.682 --> 55:20.479
Ethan must have thought he
was doing right.

55:20.550 --> 55:22.677
He's not a warrior,
he should never have tried.

55:22.752 --> 55:23.753
Tried what?

55:23.753 --> 55:26.278
Make sure the warlock
doesn't open the gateway...

55:26.356 --> 55:29.257
-...then worry about killing him.
- What the hell is it?

55:29.326 --> 55:31.794
This is going to be suicide.

55:33.296 --> 55:34.923
(sirens wailing - horns honking)

55:43.540 --> 55:45.405
Hi. Sorry.

57:08.258 --> 57:09.953
(Woman's voice)
Sinclair Enterprises,
may I help you?

57:10.193 --> 57:11.751
(Ethen yelling)

57:14.230 --> 57:16.391
Sinclair Enterprises,
may I help you?

57:16.466 --> 57:18.798
Just one moment, please.

57:21.538 --> 57:24.234
May I help you, sir!?

57:24.307 --> 57:26.275
Sir, can I help you?

57:26.342 --> 57:31.405
Can I help you, sir!
Sir, sir... can I help you?

57:31.481 --> 57:33.972
- Sir?
- Shut up!

57:39.789 --> 57:41.222
Who the hell are you?

57:43.927 --> 57:46.896
I'm sorry I couldn't make
an appointment, Nathan.

57:50.900 --> 57:52.891
How did you get past
my secretary?

57:56.306 --> 57:58.797
She's looking for a new opening.

57:59.809 --> 58:03.176
I can have security in here
in less than a minute.

58:04.414 --> 58:06.609
Who the hell do you
think you are?

58:07.383 --> 58:09.146
A collector.

58:21.364 --> 58:23.161
Wonderful.

58:26.569 --> 58:29.902
I'll give you about three seconds
to get to the point.

58:30.006 --> 58:32.873
I'm interested in this stone.

58:32.942 --> 58:35.672
Sorry, it's not for sale.

58:35.745 --> 58:38.714
I never said anything
about buying it.

58:39.749 --> 58:42.980
Please, remove it from
its encasement.

58:43.219 --> 58:44.982
You're really beginning
to piss me off.

58:45.221 --> 58:49.385
Shame, I thought you'd like to
see it with its companion pieces.

58:58.234 --> 58:59.667
Where did you get those?

59:01.204 --> 59:04.230
I told you, I'm a collector.

59:49.786 --> 59:51.549
Incredible.

59:53.256 --> 59:56.384
- How much do you want for them?
- They're not for sale.

59:56.893 --> 59:59.327
Everything is for sale.

59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.295
Including your soul?

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.922
What's that supposed to mean?

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.933
You give me the stone

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:09.404
and I'll give you the finest piece of
art your collection has ever seen.

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:12.339
And I'm supposed to trust you?

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:14.740
You are holding the gun.

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.659
I've kept my part of the bargain.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:40.862
And I shall keep mine.

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.830
Hey, where are you going?

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:48.536
What are you doing?

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:50.943
Come on, we had a deal.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:37.291
Picasso.
Definitely Picasso.

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:54.273
I don't understand.

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.879
You and my father were friends?

01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:00.177
I remember that like it was yesterday.

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:02.945
It was one hell of a day.
It really was.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:06.854
Who am I?

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:09.550
Your father and I
were very good friends.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:12.617
Until the day your
mother and my wife died.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:15.186
My mother died in childbirth.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.323
So did Kenny's mother.

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.363
I'll see you later.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.567
Don't turn away from me, Will.
Answer me.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.505
Who am I?

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.338
Who am I?

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:35.576
Sammy, you want to
open the door?

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.985
What?

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:40.420
Open the door.

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:54.563
Thank you.

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:10.880
(sneezes)

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.545
Aw, shit.

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.459
Hey, come here.

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.797
Hey, little fellah.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.908
Hi. I'm okay, yeah.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.509
You're not afraid of me, are you?

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.280
(faint laughing)

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.850
Stop laughing.

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.891
It takes a while to
get used to these things.

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.929
We'll show 'em.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.258
Okay...

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.926
Watch this.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.761
Well, how about some applause?

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.425
(wind and leaves clapping)

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.495
(humming)

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:00.786
No!

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.630
No!

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.692
Sam: And the light
of God shall pass.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:11.433
And in all places holy
the bowels of Earth shall split

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:14.271
sending forth that which
preys on the dead.

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:16.868
And within the heart of each...

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.813
lies the icon
of our destruction.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:26.512
(sighs)

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.523
I'm tired.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:33.360
You have no idea
how tired I am.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.659
Why didn't you tell me?

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:40.632
I just wanted us
to live a normal life.

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.830
I'm a warrior like Kenny.
I know it.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.637
You don't know what you're saying.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.612
Yes, I do.
I have to be reborn.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.672
There's only one way.

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:58.381
I know.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:06.291
Daddy, you have to help me.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:10.428
I can't.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.163
I can't let Kenny be alone.

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.432
I can't.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:40.520
Are you okay?

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.631
Oh, that was strange.

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:48.499
Taking that Juliet role
a little too seriously, huh?

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:51.301
I'm sorry, hon,
I couldn't.

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:54.002
I love you, daddy.

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:58.407
All back together
and the two warriors.

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:00.873
What a sight.

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.611
He'll be here soon.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.812
All the signs are now in place.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:07.355
Then it's time to give
the boy the stone.

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:09.357
These are the remaining
two stones.

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:11.222
One is a stone of our people...

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:13.853
the other is a stone that binds
all the other stones together.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:16.955
When exposed to bright light,
it can disrupt the ritual.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.759
Bright light during an eclipse,
good thinking.

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.393
Well, it's all we have left.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.838
It ain't enough.

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:25.363
We'll make it enough.

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.966
(air horn sounding)

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:33.841
Girl shouting: Fuck you!
Go to hell, bastard!

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.511
Bastard!

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.919
I'll bet you never
let your wife do that.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.947
The minute I saw you,
I said to myself..

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:13.246
there's a good samaritan.

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:18.260
Would never leave a lady
stranded out here all alone.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.886
(engine revvs-tires squeal)

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:23.295
- So, how far you headed?
- To the place of angels.

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.395
So, you got business there?

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:32.941
Of sorts.

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:37.411
Mmm...probably going to see a girl.
I don't mind.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.649
I'm the kind of girl that likes
to live in the moment.

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.777
If you know what I mean?

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.723
I must look a mess.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:55.627
Oh, god, no wonder.
It'll just take me a second...

01:08:55.698 --> 01:09:00.397
and you will see the Saline
you have only dreamed about.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:03.768
Oh, this mirror is so small,
I can't see my hair.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:06.307
It must look awful.
Doesn't it?

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.935
It does.
It looks dreadful.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.145
I know it looks awful.

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:13.443
You would tell me the truth,
wouldn't you?

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:14.846
How does it look?

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.879
Here, see for yourself.

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.819
(screaming)

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.916
It's beautiful...

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:59.927
isn't it?

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:03.260
I was never allowed to
play here as a kid.

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:06.267
(chuckles)
I was scared to, really.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:10.237
Thought I might get swallowed up by
the spirits that live underground.

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:13.739
You scared now?

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:15.709
Terrified.

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:32.327
Come on, Samantha,
I'm taking you home.

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.986
Andy, don't be an idiot.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.224
You've been brainwashed
by this freak.

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.789
Nobody's done anything to me.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.459
I don't think you're listening.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:43.300
Oh, what's this?
Sir Fucking Lancelot to the rescue.

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.033
Get out of my face, Travis.

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.469
I don't think so.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:49.477
Leave us alone.

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.035
(gasping)

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.712
Stop! You're killing him.

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:07.586
Tomorrow, everything's
going to be destroyed.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:09.927
You, us, everything.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:13.594
So just go home and tell your
parents how much you love them.

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:23.935
I thought we were supposed to
use our powers to help people?

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:27.710
Including these witch hunters who
have driven us druids so far west

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:30.877
that the only place left
to hide is the sea?

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:34.252
Yeah, Andy as well.

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.719
What are you doing?

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.721
In the old days...

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:09.883
warriors would make love
before going off into battle.

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.459
- Good evening.
- (shrieks)

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.963
I'm sorry,
have I startled you?

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:25.499
Are you looking for someone?

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:30.004
Yes, and you could
be the one to announce me.

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.811
Are you trying to make
the eclipse not happen?

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.677
Yeah.

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:43.574
But it's happening anyway.

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:50.951
What are you doing?

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:55.286
I'm the one who's
trained to fight him.

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.699
- But I have to help...
- Just listen to me.

01:13:57.699 --> 01:14:00.395
You've gotta keep this safe...

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:05.397
no matter what happens to me...

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:08.341
don't let him get this stone.

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.721
(pounding)

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.662
Where is everybody?

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:33.257
I thought you organized a little
tar and feather party.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.735
Yeah... something's not
right here.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:39.874
Well, I guess we found out
where everybody is.

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:42.911
What in heaven's name are they
doing by the church?

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:52.644
What are you all doing?

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.951
Please, let us through.

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.753
Excuse me. Come on, people.

01:14:57.826 --> 01:15:00.226
Step aside, please.

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:02.320
Please, let us through.

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:13.765
For God's sake,
somebody cut her down.

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.241
Cut her down yourself!

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:16.174
Satanist.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.837
You sick bastard!

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:19.972
Please, please.

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:22.979
What did you do, Reverend,
help them nail her up?

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:25.379
You're all in terrible danger.

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:27.718
The safest place for you
is in your houses.

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:30.349
There's no safe place
for you to be.

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.303
Welcome to the majors.

01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:50.241
Dad.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.678
No! Where's Franks?

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.942
I thought he was with you.

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.418
The warlock's here, isn't he?

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.651
I'm going after him.

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:03.520
I'm going with you.

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.685
Dad, you and Ted get
these people off the streets.

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:08.525
Will... it's time to let him go.

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:12.191
Get this stone
as far away as possible.

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:14.531
Remember, no matter
what happens to me...

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:20.708
Give me the stone.

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.573
You'll never get the stone!

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.771
Give me the stone!

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:26.336
(yelling)

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:32.248
Thank you.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.631
You missed.

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.499
No, I didn't.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.969
My move.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:36.345
Is this the best you can do!?

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.258
(revving)

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:31.806
Nice move.

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:33.704
It's your last.

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:05.834
So...

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:10.275
which of you is a second warrior?

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.570
You're no warrior...

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.542
and nor you.

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:20.943
Happy trails, partners.

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:48.842
Where is the final stone?

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:53.041
Sorry?

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:59.887
Where is the final stone?

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.752
(Kenny continues yelling)

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.697
Let him go, you bastard.

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:15.861
Sam, no!

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:18.997
Ah, the second warrior.

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:22.635
Here's your damn necklace.
You want it?

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.508
Come and get it.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.491
Kenny...

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.692
you're going to be all right.

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:50.632
We may not be able to fight...
but we can still heal.

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.673
(screams in agony)

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:01.906
I believe you have
something for me.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:11.775
Let's not make this difficult,
shall we?

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:44.213
You don't look so tough now,
do you blondie?

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:08.274
You didn't really
expect me to die?

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:14.209
I mean,
I'm older than these trees.

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.840
These rocks.

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:32.657
Wench.

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:57.685
I believe your exact words were...

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.954
''Here's your damn necklace.''

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:18.607
Thank you, very much.

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:24.178
Go to hell.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.581
It is time.

01:25:57.519 --> 01:26:00.317
I welcome thy lord!

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.278
Strike!

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:37.752
Sam!

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:54.599
Kenny!

01:27:19.467 --> 01:27:21.765
(growling)

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:53.425
Oh, shit.

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:58.463
Sam! I need your help.

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:00.473
I'm too weak.

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:03.305
Hit the stones with the lights.

01:28:03.378 --> 01:28:05.676
The headlights.

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:08.238
Concentrate on the lights.

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:27.835
Welcome to the twentieth
century, asshole!

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:46.970
They say this is tempered with
metal from the Holy Grail.

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:49.978
I think it belongs to you.

01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:07.279
Wait... the stones.

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:39.783
The birth stone.
