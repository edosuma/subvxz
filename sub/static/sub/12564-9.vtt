00:00.054 --> 00:01.617
Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:01.639 --> 00:03.232
I'm still experiencing some pain,

00:03.258 --> 00:05.458
so I thought I should add back
a little Hydrocodone.

00:05.460 --> 00:08.645
- How much do you need?
- Don't fret, you're new.

00:08.647 --> 00:10.230
I've lived here for over two years.

00:10.232 --> 00:11.848
Oh, dear, no. I meant new to politics.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.483
I'm sure you'll catch on.

00:13.485 --> 00:16.486
I'm running against Blythe
Ballard's handpicked candidate

00:16.488 --> 00:18.438
because Blythe has
a monopoly on the power

00:18.440 --> 00:19.772
of the Hamptons' village council.

00:19.774 --> 00:21.191
We want to buy Hankmed.

00:21.193 --> 00:22.442
Get a room, and don't come out

00:22.444 --> 00:23.910
until a deal's been finalized.

00:23.912 --> 00:26.496
I think you're gonna be very
pleased with what we worked out.

00:26.498 --> 00:27.980
- I know I am.
- Huh.

00:27.982 --> 00:30.950
- Isn't it beautiful?
- We paid this for that?

00:30.952 --> 00:32.869
I would buy you a copy
of <i>Art For Dummies,</i>

00:32.871 --> 00:34.537
but I don't think you'd understand it!

00:34.539 --> 00:36.789
I share more than a surname with Boris.

00:36.791 --> 00:38.708
You have the same genetic disease.

00:38.710 --> 00:41.827
What is Milos expecting
to find in these items?

00:41.829 --> 00:43.429
The Count of St. Germain.

00:43.431 --> 00:46.266
It's an old Bavarian myth
about a magic elixir

00:46.268 --> 00:47.884
which, when stored inside of a clock,

00:47.886 --> 00:49.052
promised immortality.

00:49.054 --> 00:51.054
You do have the cure,

00:51.056 --> 00:53.439
and you've kept it for yourself.

00:54.809 --> 00:57.060
There is no cure.

01:29.511 --> 01:30.643
I'm sorry, sir.

01:30.645 --> 01:31.844
Pothole.

01:31.846 --> 01:34.380
But we're almost out of the city.

01:47.612 --> 01:50.830
Ask me about my stance on plastic bags.

01:50.832 --> 01:52.115
What's your stance on plastic bags?

01:52.117 --> 01:53.917
I am against plastic bags.

01:53.919 --> 01:56.336
The only thing that belongs
in the ocean is fish.

01:56.338 --> 01:57.870
What about whales?

01:57.872 --> 01:59.372
Are you anti-mammal?

01:59.374 --> 02:02.592
I am pro-whale, but anti-plastic bag.

02:02.594 --> 02:03.676
Except the one you're using right now.

02:03.678 --> 02:05.378
The... yes.

02:05.380 --> 02:07.180
That's a really great answer, Evan.

02:07.182 --> 02:08.298
Yeah.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.414
So okay, let's remember that

02:09.417 --> 02:11.050
I'm debating Edwina Bowman,

02:11.051 --> 02:12.418
who was handpicked by Blythe Ballard,

02:12.420 --> 02:14.137
and Blythe Ballard is probably
prepping her right now,

02:14.139 --> 02:16.105
and she's definitely not
just like, "oh, good answer."

02:16.107 --> 02:18.057
Evan, I don't have time
to argue about a debate.

02:18.059 --> 02:19.726
I need to put Boris's estate
back in order

02:19.728 --> 02:21.894
now that he's alive again.

02:21.896 --> 02:24.897
- That sounds really weird.
- That may sound weird,

02:24.899 --> 02:26.816
but the fact is, everything
is back to normal now.

02:26.818 --> 02:29.118
Yeah, except "normal" means
no more castle-sitting.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.954
Well, we can live without 16 bathrooms.

02:30.956 --> 02:32.438
I know.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.656
I'm just saying,
a person shouldn't have to.

02:33.658 --> 02:36.326
We're gonna find a great place, okay?

02:36.328 --> 02:38.211
- Bye.
- All right, bye, babe.

02:39.447 --> 02:40.964
Okay, so...

02:40.966 --> 02:43.583
Oh, Twitter alert!

02:43.585 --> 02:45.168
I'm following this political blogger,

02:45.170 --> 02:47.086
Ally Cunningham.
She's moderating the debate.

02:47.088 --> 02:48.554
- Huh.
- She tweets a lot about opinion

02:48.556 --> 02:51.474
polls and, apparently,
also pocket tweets.

02:51.476 --> 02:53.676
What the heck?

02:53.678 --> 02:56.646
And another one, wow.
She must be sitting on her...

02:56.648 --> 02:57.897
Uh-oh.

02:57.899 --> 02:58.931
- I don't want to ask.
- I wouldn't.

02:58.933 --> 02:59.983
- I have to.
- Are you sure?

02:59.985 --> 03:01.067
Maybe not. I could live with...

03:01.069 --> 03:02.068
Would you please look at this?

03:02.070 --> 03:03.653
- Yeah
- Yes.

03:03.655 --> 03:05.938
Oh, it's a political sign.
They're all over town.

03:05.940 --> 03:08.107
Yeah, outside Baker And The Bean.

03:08.109 --> 03:10.476
Hashtag, "I'd better get down there."

03:10.478 --> 03:12.645
Uh, please don't hashtag
things out loud.

03:12.647 --> 03:14.248
I've got to put some of my signs up too.

03:14.249 --> 03:15.448
Wait, wait, wait.
Aren't you supposed to be

03:15.450 --> 03:17.116
covering me at
the Hamptons Heritage meeting?

03:17.118 --> 03:18.534
Uh, yes, that's why I sent Jeremiah.

03:18.536 --> 03:19.869
Jeremiah is not a department head.

03:19.871 --> 03:21.838
Hashtag, "boring meeting."

03:34.685 --> 03:37.503
Oh! Jeremiah.
Is the meeting over already?

03:37.505 --> 03:39.772
Yes, it was quite efficient.
I enjoyed it.

03:39.774 --> 03:41.557
Oh. I was on my way to relieve you,

03:41.559 --> 03:43.192
but, uh, thanks for covering for Evan.

03:43.194 --> 03:45.311
Oh, you mean covering for you.

03:45.313 --> 03:46.779
You're the head of the department, Hank.

03:46.781 --> 03:48.948
Chief of concierge medicine,
whether you like it or not.

03:48.950 --> 03:50.400
Yeah, I'm not much of a meeting guy.

03:50.402 --> 03:51.701
- That's more Evan's territory...
- Hmm.

03:51.703 --> 03:53.185
Which is why I tried to send him.

03:53.187 --> 03:55.488
- Oh.
- Shelby Shackleford?

03:55.490 --> 03:57.373
That's me. Who are they from?

03:57.375 --> 03:59.792
Uh, Mr. Keller.

03:59.794 --> 04:01.828
Every flower sends a particular message.

04:01.830 --> 04:04.630
Would you like to hear about gardenias?

04:04.632 --> 04:06.999
Oh, no. I got the message.

04:07.001 --> 04:08.634
Huh. I never would have taken Ken

04:08.636 --> 04:10.136
as the flower type.

04:10.138 --> 04:11.721
Oh, he's not. But I am.

04:11.723 --> 04:13.673
Call me once Jeremiah has filled you in

04:13.675 --> 04:15.758
on the meeting you skipped.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.894
Will do.

04:21.148 --> 04:23.316
Oh, by the way, I'm on
my last day of pain pills.

04:23.318 --> 04:26.519
- I could use a refill.
- Of course.

04:26.521 --> 04:27.770
When did I write the last one?

04:27.772 --> 04:29.439
Aah! Help!

04:29.441 --> 04:30.606
Help me!

04:30.608 --> 04:33.392
I need help! Aah!

04:33.394 --> 04:34.894
- Okay, okay, careful.
- Aah! Aah!

04:34.896 --> 04:36.696
Don't move! Don't move.

04:36.698 --> 04:38.831
Easy. Okay.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.451
Okay. All right.

Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

04:54.052 --> 04:56.186
It really hurts.

04:56.188 --> 04:58.555
How can I help, Dr. Lawson?

04:58.557 --> 05:00.690
More alcohol swabs, please.

05:06.315 --> 05:08.431
Um, is the pain subsiding?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.116
Oh, it hurts like crazy.

05:10.118 --> 05:12.068
I... I always laugh at the wrong time.

05:12.070 --> 05:13.987
My dad called it, "the church giggles."

05:13.989 --> 05:15.405
How did this happen?

05:15.407 --> 05:18.158
Oh, I was bringing
the nurses purple lilacs,

05:18.160 --> 05:21.110
but then I accidentally
grabbed the cactus,

05:21.112 --> 05:24.631
and then... I fell.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.716
Looks like you've done this before.

05:26.718 --> 05:28.585
How did you know?

05:28.587 --> 05:31.755
Um, these are granulomas.

05:31.757 --> 05:33.723
They form when your
immune system walls off

05:33.725 --> 05:35.508
foreign bodies to your skin.

05:35.510 --> 05:36.626
They're telling me this wasn't

05:36.628 --> 05:38.178
your first scuffle with a cactus.

05:38.180 --> 05:39.512
I'm gonna give you

05:39.514 --> 05:41.982
a steroid injection
for the inflammation.

05:41.984 --> 05:44.851
Little pinch.

05:44.853 --> 05:46.736
Could you have a vision problem?

05:46.738 --> 05:48.188
I wondered that.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.607
That's why I had
my eyes tested last week.

05:50.609 --> 05:52.325
20/20 vision.

05:52.327 --> 05:54.411
Good.

05:54.413 --> 05:55.829
- Anything else?
- Uh, no.

05:55.831 --> 05:57.330
We've got it under control.
You're a lifesaver.

05:57.332 --> 06:00.533
I have ten hours worth of work
to do in an eight-hour shift.

06:00.535 --> 06:01.701
Go ahead. We're fine.

06:01.703 --> 06:03.670
Thanks. Feel better.

06:10.428 --> 06:13.263
Well, I guess there's nothing
wrong with your eyesight,

06:13.265 --> 06:15.882
but you do need to pay attention
to what you're doing, okay?

06:15.884 --> 06:17.517
Next time, watch for thorns.

06:17.519 --> 06:19.052
Glochids.

06:19.054 --> 06:20.186
The hair-like spines on cacti

06:20.188 --> 06:22.689
are called glochids.

06:22.691 --> 06:25.392
Oh. Okay, um, ooh.

06:25.394 --> 06:27.694
You mind finishing up
the glochid removal?

06:27.696 --> 06:31.948
I... I'm meeting Boris. Thanks.

06:31.950 --> 06:34.567
Oh, and Jeremiah,
I'll... I'll get that other

06:34.569 --> 06:36.519
patient's prescription from you later.

06:37.988 --> 06:39.188
Bye, Felix.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.408
Mm, bye.

07:07.435 --> 07:08.768
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:08.770 --> 07:10.070
Sorry to bother you, Ally,

07:10.072 --> 07:12.155
but I'm Evan R. Lawson, for Change.

07:12.157 --> 07:15.108
I know who you are.
I'm your debate moderator.

07:15.110 --> 07:16.409
Oh, right.

07:16.411 --> 07:17.994
Also, your umbrella impaled a protestor

07:17.996 --> 07:19.162
at the campaign event.

07:19.164 --> 07:21.063
That was a huge story for me.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.165
The video went viral.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.534
Did it?

07:24.536 --> 07:27.203
Did you see my tweet
on the Harborfest poll?

07:27.205 --> 07:28.671
I did not. Not yet.

07:28.673 --> 07:32.125
Um, did... wait a minute. Unless...

07:32.127 --> 07:34.594
There were these.

07:34.596 --> 07:36.880
- Is that it?
- Oh.

07:36.882 --> 07:38.247
How did I miss that?

07:38.249 --> 07:39.799
Oh, people pocket tweet all the time.

07:39.801 --> 07:41.250
I guess I got distracted.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.085
I have a bit of a headache.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.972
Well, a headache can totally
throw you off your game, Ally.

07:45.974 --> 07:49.309
That's serious. Would you let me help?

07:49.311 --> 07:50.777
You see, I'm not just
Evan R. Lawson for Change,

07:50.779 --> 07:52.812
I'm also Evan R. Lawson, CFO of Hankmed.

07:52.814 --> 07:54.030
I know that too.

07:54.032 --> 07:55.949
You must think that I'm
a terrible reporter.

07:55.951 --> 07:57.266
No, not at all.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.735
It's... it's just...

07:58.737 --> 08:00.436
you know, pick up a few things

08:00.438 --> 08:02.155
being around a doctor your whole life.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.740
- Oh, whoa, what are you doing?
- Oh.

08:03.742 --> 08:05.158
My brother.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.409
I've seen him do it
a million times for headaches.

08:06.411 --> 08:08.044
It works like a charm, like, instantly.

08:08.046 --> 08:10.547
So you've just got to put it
against your orbital...

08:10.549 --> 08:12.048
- That's cold.
- Lobe thing.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.249
Okay.

08:13.251 --> 08:14.884
Breathe.

08:14.886 --> 08:16.619
Okay.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.221
If you breathe...
is that feeling a little better?

08:18.223 --> 08:20.507
Thanks, but now I have mascara
in my eye, so...

08:20.509 --> 08:22.458
Oh, well, I... I'm sorry.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.893
I'm so sorry. I can...

08:23.895 --> 08:26.896
Oh! Oh, no.

08:26.898 --> 08:28.264
Okay, I'll... I... I'll fix this.

08:28.266 --> 08:31.634
- Oh, my God.
- I'll be right back.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.269
Oh, my God.

08:37.192 --> 08:39.659
Do you really think he'll apologize?

08:39.660 --> 08:41.644
Well, I imagine his attorney

08:41.645 --> 08:43.312
has insisted that he appear remorseful

08:43.313 --> 08:45.281
so she can plead for leniency.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.990
Cousin Boris, thank you for visiting.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.659
This is not a social call, Milos.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.128
You're lucky I turned you over
to the authorities

08:59.130 --> 09:01.881
instead of handling you myself.

09:01.883 --> 09:06.803
Uh, I gave the physicians here
your latest test results.

09:06.805 --> 09:08.471
I have some questions.

09:08.473 --> 09:10.356
First, tell me again?

09:10.358 --> 09:12.141
- What?
- I know, I know.

09:12.143 --> 09:18.314
You've told me 100 times. But once more?

09:18.316 --> 09:22.035
The Count of St. Germain.

09:22.037 --> 09:25.405
The man who does not die.

09:25.407 --> 09:26.873
Oh-oh, we'll have to come back later

09:26.875 --> 09:30.326
- when he's more... lucid.
- Milos...

09:30.328 --> 09:34.581
Cousin Boris, papa won't be
home for hours, and I'm bored.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.596
I've had a couple
of headaches this week,

09:49.598 --> 09:51.848
but I ignore them and they go away.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.516
Pain is your body's way of telling you

09:53.518 --> 09:54.767
that something isn't right.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.436
Well, I'm not gonna slow down

09:56.438 --> 09:58.605
for a couple of barely-there headaches.

09:58.607 --> 10:00.273
There's too much to cover.

10:00.275 --> 10:02.242
Blythe's council is busy.

10:02.244 --> 10:03.660
"Blythe's council"?

10:03.662 --> 10:05.078
Hard not to think of it as hers.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.914
She's been around since
my grandfather ran the show.

10:07.916 --> 10:10.166
Who's your grandfather?

10:10.168 --> 10:12.418
You've never heard of John Cunningham?

10:12.420 --> 10:14.837
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's great.

10:14.839 --> 10:16.205
You'll be the first person

10:16.207 --> 10:18.407
in Hamptons politics not to call me

10:18.409 --> 10:20.576
"John Cunningham's granddaughter Ally."

10:20.578 --> 10:22.745
Wow, that's not much of a nickname.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.930
How about we just go with "Al"?

10:25.550 --> 10:28.751
Point is, he had the place
wired, and now Blythe does.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.853
You'll learn.

10:30.855 --> 10:32.605
I would suggest over
the counter Ibuprofen,

10:32.607 --> 10:34.807
but if your headaches become
more severe or more frequent,

10:34.809 --> 10:36.258
please give me a call, right away.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.394
Sure. Thanks.

10:38.396 --> 10:40.530
So, that's it, Divya. Thank you.

10:40.532 --> 10:42.115
Don't hesitate to call anytime
you want, Ally.

10:42.117 --> 10:43.316
- Anytime.
- Okay.

10:43.318 --> 10:44.484
Looking forward to that debate.

10:44.486 --> 10:46.703
- Thank you.
- Great.

10:46.705 --> 10:48.771
Bye-bye.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.206
Aspirin?

10:50.208 --> 10:52.942
That's your big medical solve, aspirin?

10:52.944 --> 10:54.077
Ibuprofen.

10:54.079 --> 10:56.913
Oh, okay. Divya...

10:56.915 --> 10:58.781
you need to follow up with her, today.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.500
This woman could make or break
my political future.

11:00.502 --> 11:02.335
You heard her.
Blythe has the council wired.

11:02.337 --> 11:03.953
You know what that means, "wired"?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.805
It means I cut the wrong wire,
boom, my future explodes!

11:05.807 --> 11:08.624
Just be prepared
and be the best candidate.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.292
Or at least be prepared.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.594
I can't... how am I supposed
to be prepared?

11:11.596 --> 11:14.230
I have no one to prepare with.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.184
- No.
- Yes.

11:18.186 --> 11:20.136
- No!
- Come on, it's perfect!

11:20.138 --> 11:21.354
You never agree with me on anything!

11:21.356 --> 11:22.905
- No way!
- See?

11:22.907 --> 11:24.991
Please, Divya, Divya.

11:24.993 --> 11:27.026
I will owe you, big time, okay?

11:27.028 --> 11:29.529
I'll owe a huge favor to be named later.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.117
I know I'm gonna regret this.

11:34.119 --> 11:36.919
Divya!

11:36.921 --> 11:38.955
Yeah, I regret it.

11:43.794 --> 11:45.094
Jeremiah.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.347
How long have you been here?

11:47.349 --> 11:48.548
47 minutes.

11:48.550 --> 11:51.884
- Oh.
- Um, I checked my records

11:51.886 --> 11:55.471
on the date and dosage
of the Hydrocodone I prescribed.

11:55.473 --> 11:57.506
You shouldn't need a refill yet.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.610
Oh, yeah, I did take
a couple extra pills.

12:00.612 --> 12:02.278
Only on bad days.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.148
14 bad days?

12:05.150 --> 12:07.116
What are you implying?

12:07.118 --> 12:09.185
I'm uncomfortable writing
another prescription

12:09.187 --> 12:11.037
for opiates again so soon.

12:11.039 --> 12:13.406
I was gonna suggest maybe trying
an anti-seizure med.

12:13.408 --> 12:15.074
Yeah, I... I can't take those.

12:15.076 --> 12:17.043
They make me groggy, and I can't risk

12:17.045 --> 12:19.829
not being at my best for my patients.

12:19.831 --> 12:21.581
Are you anticipating the pain?

12:21.583 --> 12:23.132
Is that why you've taken extra?

12:23.134 --> 12:25.201
No, I've just developed
a bit of a tolerance,

12:25.203 --> 12:26.836
which is predictable with opiates.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.054
Do you watch the clock

12:28.056 --> 12:29.538
until it's time to take your medication?

12:29.540 --> 12:32.225
So you're a pain psychologist now?

12:32.227 --> 12:34.427
Uh, no, I have no background
in psychology.

12:34.429 --> 12:37.346
Right, but you're suggesting
I'm addicted to my medication.

12:37.348 --> 12:38.564
I want to make sure you're not...

12:38.566 --> 12:41.317
I'm not. I've got it under control.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.820
Isn't that what an addict would say?

12:45.774 --> 12:47.723
Jeremiah, do I look like
an addict to you?

12:47.725 --> 12:48.891
No.

12:48.893 --> 12:49.992
- But...
- Look, if you don't want

12:49.994 --> 12:52.528
to write the script, that's fine.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.497
Sorry I asked.

13:08.751 --> 13:10.301
Oh, my... Hank.

13:10.303 --> 13:13.203
I... I wasn't expecting to see you here.

13:13.205 --> 13:15.222
I thought I was following up
with Felix this morning.

13:15.224 --> 13:17.040
I thought I was.

13:17.042 --> 13:20.010
Well, since you're here,
you can grab me a 4x4.

13:25.934 --> 13:28.686
Thank you.

13:28.688 --> 13:30.604
These are beautiful.

13:30.606 --> 13:33.240
Romance and faithfulness.

13:33.242 --> 13:36.393
Peonies say romance, and birds
of paradise say faithfulness.

13:36.395 --> 13:38.061
- Huh.
- Perfect for an anniversary.

13:38.063 --> 13:39.663
Where did you learn all that?

13:39.665 --> 13:42.666
My dad taught me floriology
when I was in high school.

13:42.668 --> 13:45.903
- Floriology?
- The language of flowers.

13:45.905 --> 13:47.788
I was kind of awkward.

13:47.790 --> 13:51.091
I hit puberty early,
and kids thought I was weird.

13:51.093 --> 13:52.576
How early?

13:52.578 --> 13:55.212
Around eight, I guess.

13:55.214 --> 13:57.515
So, you dealt with social awkwardness...

13:57.517 --> 13:59.600
using flower language.

13:59.602 --> 14:01.218
I know, it didn't work out so well.

14:01.220 --> 14:04.555
I started a bimetallic
coin collectors club.

14:04.557 --> 14:06.423
That also did not work out so well.

14:08.194 --> 14:09.476
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.

14:09.478 --> 14:11.762
That's just my church giggles again.

14:11.764 --> 14:12.947
It's all right.

14:12.949 --> 14:14.064
I never have a problem talking

14:14.066 --> 14:16.150
when it comes to flowers, though.

14:16.152 --> 14:19.036
The perfect flower
for the perfect message.

14:19.038 --> 14:23.774
No words, just peonies
and birds of paradise.

14:23.776 --> 14:27.161
I was up all night arranging
these, but it was worth it.

14:27.163 --> 14:28.946
Do you work through the night a lot?

14:28.948 --> 14:32.383
All the time. I never needed much sleep.

14:32.385 --> 14:34.051
I think I'd like to do a blood draw.

14:34.053 --> 14:37.287
Early puberty could suggest
a hormone abnormality.

14:37.289 --> 14:38.505
And I want to do a sleep study.

14:38.507 --> 14:40.257
Shouldn't we wait for the blood results?

14:40.259 --> 14:42.176
Or we do the sleep study tonight.

14:42.178 --> 14:44.511
I'm not trying to be insubordinate.

14:44.513 --> 14:46.463
Yeah, no, I never...
I never said you were.

14:49.017 --> 14:51.986
Do you guys need star of Bethlehem?

14:51.988 --> 14:53.520
For reconciliation.

14:53.522 --> 14:56.490
Oh, we're fine.

14:56.492 --> 14:58.492
We're fine.

15:01.145 --> 15:03.364
Are the podia really necessary?

15:03.366 --> 15:04.999
Couldn't we have debated
at the guest house?

15:05.001 --> 15:06.367
Uh, no.

15:06.369 --> 15:07.701
The more like the actual debate it is,

15:07.703 --> 15:09.169
the more prepared I'll be.
I've thought it out.

15:09.171 --> 15:11.538
And it's actually "podiums."

15:11.540 --> 15:13.757
"Podia," from the Latin.

15:13.759 --> 15:16.844
"Podiums," from the office depot.

15:16.846 --> 15:18.345
It's... it's... but this is good.

15:18.347 --> 15:19.680
This is good debating so far.
This is great!

15:19.682 --> 15:21.181
We're getting warmed up. All right.

15:21.183 --> 15:23.350
So I know there's gonna be
a question about Harborfest,

15:23.352 --> 15:24.802
'cause Ally just did a poll.

15:24.804 --> 15:25.853
Let's just get started.

15:25.855 --> 15:26.887
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

15:26.889 --> 15:28.105
Harborfest!

15:28.107 --> 15:29.723
I think Harborfest is expensive,

15:29.725 --> 15:32.142
as well as a public safety nightmare.

15:32.144 --> 15:34.144
Don't you dare get rid of Harborfest!

15:34.146 --> 15:35.529
Whoa.

15:35.531 --> 15:37.231
It blew up the pier last year, Divya.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.449
There are lawsuits pending.

15:38.451 --> 15:40.851
Harborfest... it should be mothballed.

15:40.853 --> 15:42.820
I have loved that festival
since I was a little girl,

15:42.822 --> 15:45.239
and so have most of your constituents.

15:45.241 --> 15:47.190
So I should be pro-lawsuit?

15:47.192 --> 15:48.626
Don't take such a hard line.

15:48.628 --> 15:50.794
You can be against
the problems of Harborfest

15:50.796 --> 15:52.963
without being against
the festival itself.

15:52.965 --> 15:54.882
Sneaky.

15:54.884 --> 15:56.333
What if Ally asks me
a direct question, though?

15:56.335 --> 15:57.551
Am I pro or con?

15:57.553 --> 15:58.702
I have never heard a politician

15:58.704 --> 16:01.171
answer a question directly.

16:01.173 --> 16:02.890
No reason for you to be the first.

16:02.892 --> 16:05.059
Divya, you're like the debate whisperer.

16:05.061 --> 16:07.094
- It's so cool.
- Yeah.

16:07.096 --> 16:10.397
So where do you stand on Harborfest?

16:10.399 --> 16:13.216
Harborfest is a cherished

16:13.218 --> 16:15.653
community tradition with problems.

16:15.655 --> 16:16.770
I vehemently disagree!

16:16.772 --> 16:19.857
The festival has unique challenges.

16:19.859 --> 16:21.492
Isn't that the same thing I just said?

16:21.494 --> 16:23.410
Mine sounded better. I win.

16:25.613 --> 16:29.750
- It's just the gardener.
- I know! But he was listening.

16:29.752 --> 16:31.902
- You really are good at this.
- I know.

16:31.904 --> 16:34.672
- All right, teach me.
- First things first.

16:34.674 --> 16:36.957
They go away. I can't without my cards.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.342
Yes, you can. So ready?

16:38.344 --> 16:39.426
What is your stance on roadside mu...

16:39.428 --> 16:41.128
I can't, I need them. I'm just...

16:41.130 --> 16:42.412
- I can't, I need my cards.
- Stand!

16:42.414 --> 16:43.931
- Please give me my cards.
- No.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.132
- Are you kidding?
- I said "no."

16:45.134 --> 16:46.467
- Give me my...
- No, don't! No!

17:00.782 --> 17:04.867
Seeing Milos must have been hard for you.

17:04.869 --> 17:08.038
There are so many questions
we'll never answer.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.607
How did all this start?

17:10.608 --> 17:13.794
How long has Milos
been mentally impaired?

17:13.796 --> 17:17.114
Well, greed and illness have
been so prevalent in my family,

17:17.116 --> 17:19.717
it's difficult to know where one ends

17:19.719 --> 17:22.169
and the other begins.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.888
I doubt Milos will be able
to shed light on that now.

17:25.891 --> 17:28.509
But you might learn more
if you talk to him.

17:28.511 --> 17:31.595
Dementia does ebb and flow.

17:31.597 --> 17:34.431
All I remember is my father, Hank.

17:34.433 --> 17:36.633
He was never himself again once...

17:40.605 --> 17:42.406
Ugh. I must admit to you,

17:42.408 --> 17:44.992
since you suggested my family
history of premature death

17:44.994 --> 17:46.610
might be attributable to poisoning,

17:46.612 --> 17:48.028
I had embraced the theory,

17:48.030 --> 17:52.449
but... seeing Milos...

17:52.451 --> 17:54.501
How sick.

17:54.503 --> 17:56.486
No.

17:56.488 --> 17:59.289
This disease has always been
the real culprit.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.158
Boris, we don't know that.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.511
Well, he's not poisoning himself, is he?

18:08.166 --> 18:11.435
What I mean is...

18:11.437 --> 18:15.472
I wanted to believe that
my only enemy was Milos.

18:17.175 --> 18:19.143
And, in truth, he and I

18:19.145 --> 18:22.112
share a common enemy...

18:22.114 --> 18:23.614
Our own blood.

18:23.616 --> 18:28.018
You've outlived your father
and your grandfather already.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.037
Medicine has come a long way since then.

18:30.039 --> 18:33.707
Your wife is a preeminent geneticist.

18:33.709 --> 18:38.078
Yes, you may become sick, someday.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.031
But none of us gets to choose
when we die.

18:41.033 --> 18:42.666
Only how we live.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.210
Daisy.

18:53.212 --> 18:54.928
I didn't know you worked down here.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.230
I'm floating tonight.

18:56.232 --> 18:58.715
It sounds much more peaceful than it is.

18:58.717 --> 19:01.318
Really, I'm running around like
a chicken with her head cut off.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.403
I've got to be everywhere

19:03.405 --> 19:04.888
and know everything.

19:04.890 --> 19:06.389
It's so doctors have someone
to blame, right?

19:06.391 --> 19:07.825
You found us out.

19:07.827 --> 19:09.443
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:09.445 --> 19:11.695
- Did I tickle you?
- No.

19:13.081 --> 19:16.416
Well, is it too tight then?

19:16.418 --> 19:19.453
Okay, well, sleep well.

19:19.455 --> 19:21.505
Good night, Daisy.

19:25.343 --> 19:28.929
Guys, what is all this?

19:28.931 --> 19:30.714
This is a polysomnogram.

19:30.716 --> 19:32.883
It'll record your blood oxygen
level, breathing,

19:32.885 --> 19:36.803
and rem stages, and this eeg
will record your brain activity.

19:36.805 --> 19:39.640
Like a seismograph,
but without earthquakes.

19:39.642 --> 19:42.192
No earthquakes.

19:42.194 --> 19:43.593
I'll do my best.

19:43.595 --> 19:45.595
You'll do great. All right, Felix.

19:45.597 --> 19:47.564
Pleasant dreams.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.334
- Hey.
- Hey, babe!

22:50.336 --> 22:52.136
I missed you this morning.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.337
I feel like it's been forever

22:53.339 --> 22:54.721
since you were here when I woke up.

22:54.723 --> 22:55.806
Yeah, sorry.

22:55.808 --> 22:59.309
- I had to leave early.
- Why?

22:59.311 --> 23:01.845
Oh, no. She's here.

23:01.847 --> 23:03.129
Who's where?

23:03.131 --> 23:06.433
Blythe Ballard is
at the Red Hat Society.

23:06.435 --> 23:08.352
Why are you at the Red Hat Society?

23:08.354 --> 23:09.853
Ally tweeted she'd be here

23:09.855 --> 23:11.989
and I thought she could cover me
at a community event.

23:11.991 --> 23:16.193
But the Red Hat Society
is a women's organization.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.997
Yes, I know that... now.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.616
Um, oh, man, this keeps getting worse.

23:22.618 --> 23:23.817
My opponent is here.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.202
Yeah, you said that.

23:25.204 --> 23:28.789
No, Blythe Ballard is my nemesis.

23:28.791 --> 23:31.124
Edwina Bowman is my opponent.

23:31.126 --> 23:32.292
What are you drinking, Blythe?

23:32.294 --> 23:33.827
- It looks delicious.
- Oh.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.262
What did you say this was, Countess?

23:35.264 --> 23:38.348
This is the pomegranate
champagne cocktail.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.468
And, of course, the Countess
always uses the best champagne.

23:41.470 --> 23:43.520
Oh, my God.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.522
They're talking
to the friggin' Countess now.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.357
It sounds like we chose
the perfect chairwoman

23:47.359 --> 23:49.009
to provide the event with elegance.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.311
Darling, I literally
wrote the book on it.

23:51.313 --> 23:54.014
It looks like they're friends.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.650
Look at them all together.
They're laughing and talking.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.952
They're like the <i>Mayflower</i> mafia.

23:58.954 --> 24:00.237
Oh, my God, Blythe
is going in for a hug.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.822
Blythe is hugging Ally.

24:01.824 --> 24:04.024
She's hugging her.
It's a tender and genuine

24:04.026 --> 24:05.659
warm hug.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.193
That's a clear conflict of interest!

24:07.195 --> 24:09.046
I doubt it's a conspiracy.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.498
The Red Hat Society is one of the oldest

24:11.500 --> 24:12.883
and most prestigious in the Hamptons.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.468
My mom is a member.

24:14.470 --> 24:16.536
What are you saying,
you're on their side?

24:16.538 --> 24:18.872
Of course not!
But I'm sure Ally is just there

24:18.874 --> 24:21.008
to do her job.

24:22.710 --> 24:24.595
You're probably right. Ugh.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.980
I think I have the debate nerves.

24:26.982 --> 24:28.849
Hey, do you want to get an early lunch?

24:28.851 --> 24:31.435
- I could really use a break.
- Yeah, sounds great.

24:38.159 --> 24:39.276
I gotta go.

24:40.394 --> 24:42.696
Hello? Evan?

24:42.698 --> 24:43.864
I need Divya.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.966
Uh, I brought you something.

25:05.353 --> 25:07.137
A biofeedback machine?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.272
Yes, I've had success with it before.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.356
I'll show you.

25:09.358 --> 25:10.974
That... that's okay.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.726
Listen, I owe you an apology.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.978
I reacted badly the other day.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.097
I mean, you were just asking
the appropriate questions.

25:17.099 --> 25:21.368
- I know.
- Oh, uh, glad that's settled.

25:21.370 --> 25:23.070
I can show you how
the biofeedback machine

25:23.072 --> 25:24.121
works now, if you like.

25:25.491 --> 25:28.492
That might be Felix's
sleep study results.

25:34.048 --> 25:35.582
He never reached slow-wave sleep.

25:35.584 --> 25:36.783
Check the EEG.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.336
Yep.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.055
Seizures. Looks like five of them.

25:42.057 --> 25:44.591
I wonder if partial or absence seizures

25:44.593 --> 25:46.810
might have caused Felix
to pick up the cactus.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.261
An automatism.

25:48.263 --> 25:50.180
Brief, unconscious behavior.
That makes sense.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.398
Felix needs an MRI.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.233
- As soon as possible.
- Let's go get him now.

25:53.235 --> 25:55.319
He shouldn't be driving anything
bigger than a flower cart

25:55.321 --> 25:57.270
until we know what's causing
the seizures.

25:57.272 --> 25:59.573
I guess you were right
about the sleep study.

25:59.575 --> 26:02.576
I know.

26:02.578 --> 26:05.329
Just kidding.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.332
- Can I walk on it?
- Yes, it's a mild sprain,

26:08.334 --> 26:10.867
but do take it easy for a few days.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.252
Ally was awfully lucky you were here

26:12.254 --> 26:14.621
to call your colleague, Mr. Lawson.

26:14.623 --> 26:16.123
Yes, all in a day's work.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.507
What were you doing here?

26:20.128 --> 26:22.963
Well, Ms. Ballard, the Red Hat Society

26:22.965 --> 26:25.182
is a cherished community organization.

26:25.184 --> 26:28.468
Also, I look good in hats.

26:28.470 --> 26:30.687
Do you remember when you
joined the Red Hats, dear?

26:30.689 --> 26:32.139
You had that adorable pink cap.

26:33.475 --> 26:34.674
That was the year Frances Vance

26:34.676 --> 26:36.610
drank a full bottle of Chardonnay.

26:37.980 --> 26:40.147
I think I fell down
the same stairs she did.

26:40.149 --> 26:41.347
It's a good thing you control

26:41.349 --> 26:42.949
the media coverage for the event.

26:42.951 --> 26:45.118
One time in high school,

26:45.120 --> 26:47.988
I drank three wine coolers at
Gregg Millman's homecoming party

26:47.990 --> 26:49.956
and fell out of his
little brother's tree house.

26:49.958 --> 26:52.358
That's similar...

26:52.360 --> 26:55.128
Oh, that's... charming.

26:56.530 --> 26:59.049
Thanks, Divya. Evan.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.034
Call me if you need anything.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.893
How am I supposed to compete with that?

27:21.022 --> 27:23.273
Hard to believe there's
a language of flowers, huh?

27:23.275 --> 27:24.991
Apparently, the Victorian era

27:24.993 --> 27:27.060
was rigid in custom and etiquette,

27:27.062 --> 27:30.247
so the subtlety of floriology provided

27:30.249 --> 27:33.250
a way around outright flirtation.

27:34.952 --> 27:38.422
Is that Felix?

27:50.853 --> 27:52.969
Felix!

27:52.971 --> 27:54.855
He's picking flowers.
It must be an automatism.

27:54.857 --> 27:56.589
Felix!

27:56.591 --> 28:00.610
He can't hear us.

28:09.672 --> 28:11.440
Wait, wait, wait.

28:11.442 --> 28:12.474
Is there any neck pain?

28:12.476 --> 28:14.509
- No, no.
- Are you okay?

28:14.511 --> 28:17.613
Oh, my head hurts.

28:17.615 --> 28:21.533
Oof. Let's get you up.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.185
That's it.

28:23.187 --> 28:25.404
Bringing you over to the car, okay?

28:25.406 --> 28:26.705
Right here.

28:26.707 --> 28:30.525
That's it.

28:30.527 --> 28:32.861
Okay, let me just take
a look at your eye.

28:32.863 --> 28:34.213
Right.

28:34.215 --> 28:36.331
How many fingers am I holding up?

28:36.333 --> 28:38.050
II can't see.

28:38.052 --> 28:40.869
The swelling is progressing too rapidly.

28:40.871 --> 28:42.171
Could be a retrobulbar hemorrhage.

28:42.173 --> 28:44.757
Yep.

28:44.759 --> 28:46.258
Felix, we just need to examine your eye.

28:52.099 --> 28:53.381
Head back, please.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.401
That's it, head back.

28:57.187 --> 28:59.188
Steady.

28:59.190 --> 29:01.490
Ow.

29:01.492 --> 29:03.558
- 38.
- He needs a lateral canthotomy,

29:03.560 --> 29:05.393
- now.
- Wha... here?

29:05.395 --> 29:07.062
- Not at the hospital?
- I called 911,

29:07.064 --> 29:08.664
but if we wait too long
to relieve the pressure,

29:08.666 --> 29:11.533
your vision may be in danger.

29:11.535 --> 29:13.368
Yep.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.339
Oh, God.

29:17.341 --> 29:19.875
Stay calm, stay calm. You're okay.

29:19.877 --> 29:21.743
I just need to anesthetize your eye.

29:21.745 --> 29:23.411
You're gonna feel a little pressure.

29:27.251 --> 29:30.385
Okay. Clamp.

29:30.387 --> 29:32.387
Thank you.

29:32.389 --> 29:33.755
Okay, this will minimize bleeding.

29:35.309 --> 29:38.143
- Clamping.
- You'll feel relief right away.

29:38.145 --> 29:41.980
The scissors.

29:43.450 --> 29:45.868
Thank you.

29:55.712 --> 29:58.113
Okay, I got it. Yep.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.834
Once more.

30:03.921 --> 30:05.420
- 15, normal.
- Okay.

30:05.422 --> 30:06.672
You're not gonna lose your eyesight,

30:06.674 --> 30:08.307
but we still need to get you
to a hospital.

30:09.844 --> 30:13.128
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

30:13.130 --> 30:15.097
I've never been able to help it.

30:21.138 --> 30:23.572
Evan?

30:23.574 --> 30:26.241
Evan. Evan!

30:26.243 --> 30:27.359
What?

30:27.361 --> 30:28.643
Focus.

30:28.645 --> 30:31.079
I'm good, okay? I got this.

30:31.081 --> 30:34.199
Just... do 40% of citizens want
to revamp Harborfest,

30:34.201 --> 30:35.701
or was it that 40% want

30:35.703 --> 30:37.035
to charge for plastic bags?
I can't remember.

30:37.037 --> 30:38.954
Ally tweeted the stats.
I just can't find the tweet now.

30:38.956 --> 30:42.424
Evan! You may not be a Ballard,

30:42.426 --> 30:45.010
or a Bowman, or a Cunningham,

30:45.012 --> 30:47.346
but you are a Lawson!

30:47.348 --> 30:48.630
What does that mean?

30:48.632 --> 30:50.215
I'm trying to give you a pep talk.

30:50.217 --> 30:52.301
- So far, it sucks.
- Pull yourself together!

30:52.303 --> 30:55.270
You can do this.
No one works as hard as you.

30:55.272 --> 30:57.890
And besides, think of it this way...

30:57.892 --> 31:00.192
you are the underdog.

31:00.194 --> 31:03.228
That's not good, Divya.

31:04.847 --> 31:06.949
Wait a second, wait a second.

31:06.951 --> 31:08.483
I'm the underdog.

31:08.485 --> 31:10.652
- That's what I just said.
- No, you don't understand.

31:10.654 --> 31:12.621
People love a good underdog story.

31:12.623 --> 31:15.073
Miracle on ice, seabiscuit, underdog!

31:15.075 --> 31:16.208
That's what I was trying to say.

31:16.210 --> 31:17.525
Take your seats, everyone.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.044
And candidates, take your places.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.963
Thank you.

31:20.965 --> 31:22.714
I can make this work for me.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.967
I still need to know
about that 40%, though.

31:24.969 --> 31:26.168
I will find Ally's tweet,

31:26.170 --> 31:28.220
and I will signal you about the poll.

31:28.222 --> 31:30.589
Go.

31:30.591 --> 31:33.592
Candidates Edwina Bowman

31:33.594 --> 31:37.012
and Evan R. Lawson. Thank you.

31:37.014 --> 31:40.215
And may the best purple win.

31:40.217 --> 31:42.651
Don't you mean, "the best person"?

31:42.653 --> 31:44.653
That's what I said.

31:47.390 --> 31:49.825
So, Felix... it turns out

31:49.827 --> 31:52.277
your "church giggles"
weren't laughter at all.

31:52.279 --> 31:54.246
They were gelastic seizures.

31:54.248 --> 31:57.115
Well, aren't seizures
when your body shakes?

31:57.117 --> 31:58.667
That's a complex seizure.

31:58.669 --> 32:00.419
A partial or absence seizures

32:00.421 --> 32:03.121
can resemble laughing
or purposeless movements.

32:03.123 --> 32:05.573
Like picking flowers that aren't there.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.092
You were born with this condition,

32:07.094 --> 32:09.795
but in some cases it can
get worse in your 30s.

32:09.797 --> 32:12.097
It explains your early puberty,
lack of sleep,

32:12.099 --> 32:14.600
- and laughing seizures.
- And the intense

32:14.602 --> 32:16.969
dreams you experienced,
they're most likely

32:16.971 --> 32:18.420
a hypnagogic hallucination.

32:18.422 --> 32:21.273
It's another possible form
of seizure activity.

32:21.275 --> 32:22.424
Will I be okay?

32:22.426 --> 32:26.194
Yes... uh, with medication.

32:26.196 --> 32:29.281
This whole time, I haven't been weird.

32:29.283 --> 32:31.700
I've been... broken.

32:31.702 --> 32:33.986
You're not weird, Felix.

32:33.988 --> 32:35.603
You may have a little trouble
communicating,

32:35.605 --> 32:37.605
but that's up to you,

32:37.607 --> 32:39.574
not your illness.

32:41.077 --> 32:43.211
Sorry to interrupt.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.914
Just wanted to leave these for you.

32:45.916 --> 32:49.084
You speak floriology?

32:49.086 --> 32:52.337
Eglantine roses are for healing.

32:52.339 --> 32:55.457
These were the freshest ones
in the gift shop.

32:55.459 --> 32:56.925
The nurses wanted to get you some

32:56.927 --> 32:59.144
since you're always leaving them for us.

32:59.146 --> 33:01.179
Felix, get well soon.

33:06.519 --> 33:09.154
I leave them for you.

33:09.156 --> 33:11.273
Me? Why?

33:13.026 --> 33:18.363
Your name, it means "cheerful."

33:18.365 --> 33:21.283
It was my grandmother's name.
She was the cheerful one.

33:21.285 --> 33:23.285
So are you.

33:25.254 --> 33:28.790
So what's floriology?

33:28.792 --> 33:32.094
Eh, how much time do you have?

33:32.096 --> 33:33.995
I could take my lunch break.

33:36.966 --> 33:39.267
Jeremiah.

33:42.855 --> 33:46.308
Every flower has a message.

33:49.812 --> 33:51.813
The humidor goes over there.

33:59.322 --> 34:02.407
Boris, I am so sorry this
reassembly is taking so long.

34:02.409 --> 34:03.658
We should be done by next week.

34:03.660 --> 34:05.243
There's no rush.

34:05.245 --> 34:06.745
Well, you can rest assured
that everything will

34:06.747 --> 34:08.029
be exactly as you left it.

34:08.031 --> 34:10.297
Good. Open that.

34:10.300 --> 34:13.835
What is it?

34:15.588 --> 34:17.304
I would like for you, Ms. Lawson,

34:17.306 --> 34:19.091
to put these up for auction personally,

34:19.092 --> 34:21.726
and to claim the commission.

34:21.728 --> 34:22.811
That's not necessary.

34:22.813 --> 34:25.731
I insist.

34:25.733 --> 34:29.900
I regret enlisting you
and your auction house

34:29.902 --> 34:32.737
without making you aware
of all the implications.

34:35.108 --> 34:37.943
Oh... Marisa, Carlos, and I

34:37.945 --> 34:39.945
won't return until the fall.

34:39.947 --> 34:40.996
You and your husband should feel free

34:40.998 --> 34:42.781
to remain in our home if you wish.

34:42.783 --> 34:45.083
That's very generous.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.734
Will you and your family be traveling?

34:46.735 --> 34:48.920
We've not yet decided.

34:48.922 --> 34:51.505
They must be looking forward to spending

34:51.507 --> 34:54.342
some time with you now that
everything's behind you.

34:57.713 --> 35:00.799
Mr. Lawson, do you support
a ban on plastic bags?

35:00.801 --> 35:03.852
Well, we need to safeguard
our waterways and landscape

35:03.854 --> 35:05.887
from pollution... that's obvious.

35:05.889 --> 35:07.639
If we lead by example now,

35:07.641 --> 35:10.925
we teach future generations to
be more conscientious consumers,

35:10.927 --> 35:13.928
and instill a feeling of pride
in this place we call home.

35:13.930 --> 35:16.264
So, ye... yes, I...

35:16.266 --> 35:19.067
Whoo!

35:22.905 --> 35:25.073
Mrs. Bowman, your rebuttal?

35:25.075 --> 35:26.408
He's doing well. He's doing well!

35:26.410 --> 35:28.410
Yes. Yes, surprisingly.

35:28.412 --> 35:30.378
Take a look at these, Ally's tweets.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.631
There are simple spelling errors
in the earlier ones,

35:32.633 --> 35:35.634
and then they turn nonsensical.

35:35.636 --> 35:37.586
You're only recently
a visitor here, Mr. Lawson.

35:37.588 --> 35:38.837
You may have been less than careful

35:38.839 --> 35:40.755
about where you threw out your garbage.

35:40.757 --> 35:42.457
I have always been an ardent recycler.

35:42.459 --> 35:44.009
I challenge you to prove otherwise.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.510
Yeah, but they could be typing errors.

35:45.512 --> 35:48.096
- I make 'em all the time.
- Or, it might be aphasia.

35:48.098 --> 35:49.931
She's had headaches for the past week.

35:49.933 --> 35:51.316
She fell down some stairs this morning.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.467
It might have been

35:52.469 --> 35:53.635
- an unsteady gait.
- Hmm.

35:53.637 --> 35:56.304
In fact, 60% of the community

35:56.306 --> 35:58.023
approves of the plastic bag charge.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.075
Are you sure it's not 40% approve?

36:00.077 --> 36:01.309
Uh...

36:01.311 --> 36:04.029
uh, it is, in fact, 40%.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.247
Thank you, Ms. Cunningham,

36:05.249 --> 36:07.032
but I don't hide behind stats.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.416
I really don't.

36:08.418 --> 36:11.336
I'm just an average guy trying
to make a difference

36:11.338 --> 36:12.454
and protect this town.

36:15.659 --> 36:17.425
I think you're right.
These tweets suggest

36:17.427 --> 36:19.127
the episodes are becoming more frequent.

36:19.129 --> 36:20.545
We need to get her to the hospital, now.

36:20.547 --> 36:22.464
Mr. Lawson, your turn.

36:22.466 --> 36:24.883
Now, I... I...

36:24.885 --> 36:26.852
Ally, we need to call
the debate off now.

36:26.854 --> 36:28.136
- Why?
- You could have a stroke

36:28.138 --> 36:29.387
at any time. Let's go.

36:29.389 --> 36:30.856
It's too important. I can't stop now.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.340
I'm sorry.

36:32.342 --> 36:33.525
Not more important than your health.

36:33.527 --> 36:35.343
I'm sorry to say,
the debate is suspended

36:35.345 --> 36:36.478
until further notice.

36:36.480 --> 36:37.779
- Thank you, all.
- Wait, what?

36:37.781 --> 36:39.147
I'm sorry, bro. We gotta go.

36:39.149 --> 36:41.283
But wha...

36:44.620 --> 36:47.739
but I'm winning.

37:27.428 --> 37:30.095
- Is she going to be all right?
- She is going to be fine.

37:30.097 --> 37:32.348
Ah, what a relief.
Thank you, Ms. Katdare.

37:32.350 --> 37:33.682
I'm so grateful you were there.

37:33.684 --> 37:35.818
Well, I'm happy to help.

37:35.820 --> 37:36.968
And, Mr. Lawson...

37:36.970 --> 37:38.520
well done this afternoon

37:38.522 --> 37:40.138
- at the debate.
- Oh.

37:40.140 --> 37:43.975
Although, I was sorry to hear
you dodge so many questions,

37:43.977 --> 37:46.912
but your first campaign is about
learning from your mistakes.

37:46.914 --> 37:48.247
Perhaps you'll be better prepared

37:48.249 --> 37:50.315
when you've been here a little longer.

37:58.842 --> 38:00.676
Do not listen to her, okay?

38:00.678 --> 38:04.096
You're just as Hamptons as anyone.

38:04.098 --> 38:08.217
No, I'm not. I am an outsider.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.185
But that's my asset.

38:11.771 --> 38:13.972
And that's how I'm gonna take her down.

38:23.451 --> 38:25.067
What are you doing here?

38:25.069 --> 38:26.852
Not exactly Southern hospitality,

38:26.854 --> 38:28.404
but it'll do for now.

38:28.406 --> 38:29.538
You didn't call me after

38:29.540 --> 38:31.407
Jeremiah briefed you on the meeting.

38:31.409 --> 38:32.825
Oh! Yeah, no.

38:32.827 --> 38:34.192
We really haven't had
a chance to discuss it.

38:34.194 --> 38:35.544
The last couple of days have just been...

38:35.546 --> 38:37.162
I know, you're used
to doing things one way,

38:37.164 --> 38:38.831
and I'm used to doing them another.

38:38.833 --> 38:40.215
I get everybody together in a meeting,

38:40.217 --> 38:42.051
I solve a problem, and go.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.086
And, I have dinner?

38:44.088 --> 38:45.754
I assume.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.539
And since you weren't at
the department head meeting,

38:47.541 --> 38:49.141
I thought we could get together
and go over a few

38:49.143 --> 38:50.976
important policies
we'd like to implement,

38:50.978 --> 38:53.312
while we eat.

38:53.314 --> 38:55.380
- I'm impressed.
- I try.

38:56.684 --> 38:58.383
Beautiful.

38:58.385 --> 39:00.569
Oh, yeah. They mean, "gratitude."

39:00.571 --> 39:02.387
I know.

39:02.389 --> 39:04.490
Ken sent me the same kind.

39:04.492 --> 39:05.824
Okay.

39:05.826 --> 39:06.825
I know it's none of my business...

39:06.827 --> 39:08.944
but Keller?

39:08.946 --> 39:09.912
I like challenges.

39:09.914 --> 39:11.530
Well, you got one.

39:11.532 --> 39:13.031
How long have you known each other?

39:13.033 --> 39:14.733
Since we were kids.

39:14.735 --> 39:16.585
He used to steal my lunch money
in junior high.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.871
- And yet, you're still friends.
- Something like that.

39:18.873 --> 39:21.423
You like challenges too.

39:21.425 --> 39:25.076
Speaking of which,
here's what we need from you.

39:25.078 --> 39:26.962
We want to expand
the concierge department.

39:26.964 --> 39:30.099
I've organized a five year plan
that is aggressive, but doable.

39:32.135 --> 39:35.253
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

39:56.826 --> 39:58.794
Boris.

40:04.217 --> 40:07.553
Long ago, there lived man who
attended the council of Nicaea.

40:10.974 --> 40:13.809
And many hundreds of years later,

40:13.811 --> 40:17.396
he influenced the poet Dante.

40:17.398 --> 40:19.130
Hundreds of years after that,

40:19.132 --> 40:21.800
he breezed into the inner circle
of Louis XV.

40:25.239 --> 40:28.407
A virtuoso violinist,

40:28.409 --> 40:30.409
he never needed a bite of food to live.

40:30.411 --> 40:32.911
He discovered the secret of alchemy.

40:32.913 --> 40:34.947
- Yes, he did.
- Mm.

40:34.949 --> 40:37.749
He created an elixir,

40:37.751 --> 40:40.118
and carried it with him
through these hundreds of years

40:40.120 --> 40:43.321
in a timepiece,

40:43.323 --> 40:47.459
because when you drink
this fantastic potion...

40:47.461 --> 40:49.428
you never die.

40:51.381 --> 40:53.432
You never die.

41:02.476 --> 41:05.644
Oh, hey.

41:05.646 --> 41:08.313
I got you these.

41:08.315 --> 41:10.699
Thanks.

41:10.701 --> 41:12.484
Five pills.

41:18.408 --> 41:22.211
I know you're in pain,
but I'm concerned.

41:22.213 --> 41:25.030
Plenty of people with real pain
become real addicts.

41:25.032 --> 41:27.198
I want to investigate your pain control,

41:27.200 --> 41:29.051
and monitor your medication intake,

41:29.053 --> 41:31.303
and prescribing these five
will allow me to do that

41:31.305 --> 41:34.890
until we can figure out
a better solution.

41:37.227 --> 41:39.878
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:41.514 --> 41:43.932
Thank you, Jeremiah.
