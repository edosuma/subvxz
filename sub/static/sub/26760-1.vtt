Fuck, you think this shit's
funny? This is my thesis, man!

02:58.278 --> 03:01.213
What are you doing?
It's a prank. It's me, Dougie.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.614
Yeah? It's a prank?
It's a prank about this!

03:04.284 --> 03:06.284
No, no, no, no, no!
What did you do?!

03:06.286 --> 03:08.587
It was a joke, that's
Dougie, man.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.556
Oh my God, you killed him.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.726
Oh fuck, I gotta hide the body.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.695
I gotta hide the fuckin' body,
Wiggles!

03:16.697 --> 03:18.330
Tanner! Tanner!

03:20.133 --> 03:23.702
Oh! Oh, shit!
Oh, did you see his face?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.404
That's gonna be cash money.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.239
That's 3 million views
out the gate, easily.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.541
Oh, we're gonna get so paid
for this.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.110
And the luau gods have blessed
us again.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.112
You were prankin' me?

03:35.114 --> 03:38.115
That was good. It went better
than I thought it would go.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.017
I thought it went the
best it could've gone.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.586
What's up?
What's up, Victor?

03:41.588 --> 03:45.357
We're now exiting the
red light district, Wiggles.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.091
Uh, you're not allowed in
here 'til you're a senior.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.026
Yes, sir.

03:49.028 --> 03:51.563
Unless he's accompanied by one
of us. This is obviously okay.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.564
Bakowski!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.998
Aw, did he puke again?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.267
Aw, you puke, you get the balls.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.936
Carlito, Beefcake.

04:00.774 --> 04:04.074
Hey, uh, asswipe.
Huh?

04:04.076 --> 04:06.076
Turn the fuck around!
Thank you!

04:06.078 --> 04:07.746
Jesus! That could've been you.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.317
What's up, man?
Yo, what's up, amigos?

04:11.452 --> 04:12.686
Timmy!

04:14.688 --> 04:17.021
Woo-hoo-hoo!

04:17.023 --> 04:18.089
Let's fuckin' luau!

04:20.360 --> 04:23.295
Aw, Doug, that's animal
cruelty, bro.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.297
Dude, they eat the
green shit, alright?

04:25.299 --> 04:26.565
It's full of vitamins.

04:26.567 --> 04:30.635
Oh hey, it's Jason.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.206
Is he sleeping?
He's sleeping.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.278
What better way to start
the day?

04:53.560 --> 04:57.061
Woo-hoo!
Are you kidding me?

04:57.063 --> 05:01.065
Are you fucking kidding me?
What did you do?

05:01.067 --> 05:03.268
Wake and bake, yo. Rise and
shine!

05:03.270 --> 05:04.803
It's the fuckin' luau party!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.271
It's working!

05:08.408 --> 05:11.209
Aw shit, J, you alright,
bro?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.347
Jason, are you okay, man?

05:18.418 --> 05:21.319
I feel good.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.656
I feel really good.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.791
What the fuck is
Wiggles doing in my room?

05:26.793 --> 05:29.093
Can't believe you got
the pledges doing this.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.765
Please don't ruin a gift that
I'm making for you, thank you.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.335
Whoa. Why so many cameras?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.471
This is our last fuckin' luau.
Mm-hm.

05:39.473 --> 05:44.843
It deserves to be... no, it
demands to be remembered.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.213
You will all thank me for making
this fuckin' luau movie...

05:48.215 --> 05:50.114
because this is gonna be the
best night of our lives.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.883
All right fine, but you gotta
promise me that no one's...

05:51.885 --> 05:53.818
gonna see this except for us,
'cause it'll ruin my life.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.488
I mean, all of ours, seriously.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.323
I know, I know, you're gonna be
a big-time doctor, I get it.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.624
Trust, I know what I'm doing.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.293
Trust, he knows what he's doing.
Thank you.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.728
Trying to immortalize you, man.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.333
Let's do that in the kitchen,
I'm starving.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.414
Oh this is some exciting stuff,
huh?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.349
Dude, it's act one. We're
meeting all the characters.

06:24.351 --> 06:29.554
Okay well, get to know
this character.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.824
Oh God, he's just
diggin' her out.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.191
Yo, yo, yo!

06:34.193 --> 06:35.192
Ay!

06:35.194 --> 06:36.494
What the fuck is this?

06:36.496 --> 06:40.197
I thought this was
just for the party, man.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.500
Yeah, the party started,
my brotha.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.868
Alright, well keep me the fuck
out of it...

06:43.870 --> 06:45.737
'cause I wanna keep my
legacy intact.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.505
Yeah, the legacy of Liza.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.442
Well, yeah, the legacy that you
guys can tell your mommies...

06:50.444 --> 06:53.445
and your daddies about when you
move back home after college...

06:53.447 --> 06:56.748
and I am working at the richest
hedge fund in New York City.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.750
Wait, were you
just with Liza's dad?

06:58.752 --> 07:01.753
Oh yeah. We were cruisin'
at 10,000 feet, man.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.754
Pretty sick.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.755
You took the copter?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.824
Yeah, well I... I took it there.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.460
I had to hoof it back,
but it was so fuckin' worth it.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.695
Bro, don't forget
your promise, alright?

07:10.697 --> 07:14.466
When you start meltin' gold,
you're buying me a jet ski.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.267
Are you kiddin' me?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.470
When I start meltin'
gold, you get a jet ski.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.738
Ay!

07:19.740 --> 07:21.840
You get a jet ski!
You get a jet ski!

07:21.842 --> 07:23.375
You get a jet ski!

07:23.377 --> 07:24.743
Everyone gets a jet ski!

07:24.745 --> 07:26.277
We all get jet skis!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.912
But I... I'm serious...

07:27.914 --> 07:30.248
Liza is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.249
Oh.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.250
I love her so much.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.518
Yup.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.253
I actually need
this for beer so....

07:35.255 --> 07:36.554
We need to do a beer run.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.590
Ah, here you go, brother.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.426
I'm gonna miss this and I you
guys are my brothers, you know.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.894
You're my boys.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.796
Dude this is like the last luau.
That's kinda sad.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.998
Yeah, it went by really,
really fast.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.268
Well, then, let's make sure
we fuck shit up...

07:50.270 --> 07:53.271
and don't remember
anything in the morning.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.708
One, two, three, the party luau!

07:56.710 --> 07:58.610
I'm sure that like lots
of people haven't heard...

07:58.612 --> 08:00.845
anything yet, you know, it could
take months and months...

08:00.847 --> 08:02.580
especially with like different
schools.

08:02.582 --> 08:03.915
I don't know, man...

08:03.917 --> 08:06.518
I think they all do this
around the same time...

08:06.520 --> 08:08.853
I mean first they send out the
acceptance letters, that's now..

08:08.855 --> 08:10.789
and then the rejection ones.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.524
But you haven't gotten
either yet, so you're tight.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.693
No, but I saw this
threat and people were saying...

08:14.695 --> 08:16.895
that they already got their
letters and shit.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.565
Whoa, dude! Just hold on
a second, don't come out.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.000
What the fuck, man?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.035
Have you been shitting
this whole time?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.770
Dude, I'm not shitting.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.939
I'm pooping, alright?
There's a big difference.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.808
It went right in the
water. There's no smell.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.810
I probably don't
even have to wipe.

08:31.812 --> 08:35.513
We're like real brothers.
Half brothers.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.681
Still, real brothers.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.527
Hey, honey, just got your text.
I'm so sorry.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.695
You weren't waiting long,
were you?

08:50.697 --> 08:53.531
Sort of... ugh, what is this?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.366
Remember, it's Dougie's
little art project.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.901
Oh, whatever. How did it go
with my dad?

08:56.903 --> 08:59.037
Good, yeah. I got to the airport
safely. It was a lot of fun.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.539
And did he say anything?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.542
Um yeah, sorta not really. I had
to ride with the luggage...

09:04.544 --> 09:06.444
and like he was on his phone
the whole time.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.613
He's like such an important
guy that it was... it was cool.

09:08.615 --> 09:09.948
It was very, very fun.

09:09.950 --> 09:10.949
He said to stay in touch.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.784
Oh baby, that's perfect!

09:12.786 --> 09:15.086
Hello, hello, my KLP beauties.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.589
How are we on this
fine luau morning?

09:17.591 --> 09:20.492
Uh, sober as fuck,
where's the booze?

09:20.494 --> 09:22.060
Maggie, I like
the way you think.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.695
You should follow me.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.497
In fact, why don't
all of you follow me?

09:25.499 --> 09:27.098
No... hold on.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.535
I brought my pledges to
help set up the fucking luau.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.771
I mean, they'll clean
toilets, do dishes, laundry.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.372
Get these bitches dirty!

09:34.374 --> 09:36.641
No, we don't need them
to clean the toilets....

09:36.643 --> 09:39.946
No, Grant, seriously,
these girls suck.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.482
You shits think you're fucking
good enough...

09:44.484 --> 09:47.385
for Kappa Lambda Phi, but you're
literally the most boring...

09:47.387 --> 09:49.788
awkward group of sluts
I've ever seen.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.924
I want this place sparkling now!
Okay.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.759
Okay, we got a lot to do so
Tanner's gonna show you around.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.994
He'll take care of you.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.763
Yeah, alright,
follow me, ladies.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.146
All right, boys.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.082
Let's get some fuckin'
pyramids on this table.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.786
You guys study Mesopotamia
in high school?

10:39.439 --> 10:40.972
Let's see yours now.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.778
Excuse me.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.589
Hm...

10:57.591 --> 10:58.923
I got one.
Hm.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.693
Pledge, you are now to
be called Lube.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.695
Did we...?

11:03.697 --> 11:06.366
Lube is my name, it will not
be of shame.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.639
You are not to leave this beach
till your detail gets clean.

11:24.651 --> 11:25.884
Oh, hi.
Hi.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.552
Um.
Yeah, you go down.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.622
Thank you.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.762
Nascar, left!

11:37.764 --> 11:39.764
How many times do
we have to tell you?

11:39.766 --> 11:42.634
Come on, dude, left, left.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.936
Oh, how does that asparagus and
goat cheese omelet taste?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.738
You're gonna be carrying this
up and down...

11:46.740 --> 11:48.172
the stairs all night, boys.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.941
This part should still be easy.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.677
They're not looking good.
Not looking good at all.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.246
Left!

11:54.248 --> 11:56.215
Jesus fucking Christ, Nascar.
You can only turn left.

11:56.217 --> 11:57.715
What don't you understand?!

11:57.717 --> 11:59.584
Stop!

11:59.586 --> 12:01.220
Nascar, you only got three
more weeks...

12:01.222 --> 12:02.887
until you see that
checkered flag.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.126
You turn right, you crash,
and you're out.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.895
Fuck!

12:10.897 --> 12:12.864
What the fuck don't you
understand...

12:12.866 --> 12:14.668
about not dropping my beer?!

12:21.174 --> 12:25.810
Oh! Oh! My baby!
What's going down here?

12:25.812 --> 12:28.513
Ah, the booze juice is good!

12:28.515 --> 12:30.748
Ah, fuck, the banister.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.218
Does it smell like jizz
down here?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.153
What is wrong with you, Dougie?
What?

12:35.155 --> 12:38.723
Wait a minute, you guys! There's
something behind here.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.758
Wiggles, bring that light over.
Come here.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.593
What? Dude, Jason, what are
you doing?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.128
I'm feelin' around.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.596
Dude, hey, I wouldn't
put my hand in there, man.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.098
There could be
something that bites.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.633
That's the dumbest
idea I've ever heard.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.704
- Ssh!
- Man, guys, let's go.

12:52.206 --> 12:55.673
Ohhh! Shit!

12:55.675 --> 12:57.675
Dude!
Fuck you!

12:57.677 --> 12:59.877
Oh my God!
Fuck you.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.046
That was good.
Fucking asshole.

13:02.048 --> 13:05.016
That was a good one.
Now what?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.918
Let's see what's
going on back here.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.889
Why? No, let's not, just don't
make it worse.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.191
Well, Jesus!

13:13.193 --> 13:16.694
All right... there goes the
whole wall.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.933
Whoa! What? This is fucked up.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.169
What the fuck?

13:30.311 --> 13:34.047
What the hell?
That's normal.

13:36.350 --> 13:38.151
What are you doing with that?

13:47.961 --> 13:49.794
I'm goin' in.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.195
That's a terrible idea.
Why would you ever do that?

13:51.197 --> 13:52.799
Wiggles, let me see that.

14:03.643 --> 14:04.878
Whoa.

14:09.383 --> 14:12.619
Okay. Okay.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.227
My God.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.044
Wow.

14:43.317 --> 14:46.418
Jase, what's up?

14:46.420 --> 14:51.089
Yo, it's crazy. Come in
here, you gotta see this.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.959
Come on!
Go.

15:01.302 --> 15:04.205
Whoa, look at all these lights.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.972
What the fuck?

15:07.974 --> 15:10.110
Think there's a
switch somewhere?

15:15.982 --> 15:20.885
Check it. What kind of bulbs
are these?

15:20.887 --> 15:23.688
What do you think
went on down here?

15:23.690 --> 15:26.258
I'll tell you what, our alumni
were masters...

15:26.260 --> 15:29.160
of the fuckin' haze, bro.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.462
I mean honestly, there's some
stuff...

15:30.464 --> 15:33.232
in the old books that puts
us to shame.

15:33.234 --> 15:35.234
Gotta start getting harder
on these kids.

15:35.236 --> 15:38.405
Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch out.
Fuck, man, shit.

15:42.376 --> 15:45.710
My beer has found the cup
it wants to be drunk from.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.479
This is a sign, boys.

15:47.481 --> 15:50.014
Our ancestors, they have spoken.

15:50.016 --> 15:54.253
Tonight is going to be epic.

15:54.255 --> 15:55.420
Whoa!
What the shit?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.291
What... what was that?

15:58.459 --> 16:00.392
I don't know.

16:02.095 --> 16:05.129
Shit, hold on, Liza's texting
me, I gotta go.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.398
Whoa, okay.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.166
Hey! Pledge!
Yes?

16:08.168 --> 16:10.202
No one comes down here tonight.
Yes, sir.

16:10.204 --> 16:12.003
Yeah, I feel like we
might get electrocuted.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.740
Let's get out of here.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.344
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah!

16:50.810 --> 16:53.345
Damn, even the cleaning
lady hot.

16:53.347 --> 16:56.448
Dude! Why are you peepin'
on Daphne?

16:56.450 --> 16:57.949
I'm sorry, sir...

16:57.951 --> 16:59.817
I was just doing
what I was told to do.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.486
Is it weird that our cleaning
lady is here the day...

17:01.488 --> 17:03.788
of the party and not tomorrow
when this place is a shithole.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.425
Mm-hm.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.961
Daphne! What's up?

17:09.963 --> 17:11.929
What are you doin' here?
Oh... getting paid.

17:11.931 --> 17:15.367
You know tonight's
like the fuckin' luau.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.269
Ugh, yeah.

17:17.271 --> 17:20.271
I see you guys gettin' ready
for it. It's the big one!

17:20.273 --> 17:21.506
It's legendary.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.308
I know.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.377
God, I've watched you guys
tear this house apart for years.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.446
And can you believe
she's still standing?

17:28.449 --> 17:30.215
I know you're here
today cleaning but....

17:30.217 --> 17:31.882
Actually, I'm really not.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.819
Your pledges and the
Kappas are doing it for me.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.288
Okay, cool but...
Yeah.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.122
Tomorrow, I mean can you please,
please come...

17:38.124 --> 17:40.325
because this place is gonna be...
Hells no.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.826
A shit hole.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.263
Day after the fucking luau?

17:44.265 --> 17:45.597
Yeah, no.

17:45.599 --> 17:47.534
I'll see ya in a month.

18:06.986 --> 18:11.088
Oinky, oinky, J, don't get your
face on our dinner.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.525
Yo, dude, it's just Claire.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.327
Man, go fuckin' talk to her.

18:15.329 --> 18:16.927
I got a bunch of classes
with her, she's really cool.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.297
I don't wanna talk to her.

18:18.299 --> 18:20.465
I mean, I don't have anything
to say.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.434
You're being such a pussy
right now.

18:22.436 --> 18:25.437
Claire! Hey! Hi.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.573
I'm gonna come say hi
in a second.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.874
You see how easy that is?

18:29.876 --> 18:33.211
Man, that was a dick move.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.146
Aw, J!

18:35.148 --> 18:39.351
Aw this fucking guy is
drowning in Claire jerkoff land.

18:39.353 --> 18:43.187
Wait, what are
you talking about?

18:43.189 --> 18:46.957
Dougie, for the last four years
this guy has been lighting...

18:46.959 --> 18:50.529
a candle, putting a smooth lube
on it, and jerking off...

18:50.531 --> 18:53.097
to some idea he's made up
for this girl, right?

18:53.099 --> 18:55.099
I'm sure he's smashed
her every single way.

18:55.101 --> 18:58.102
Raw dog anal, we hope, but the
problem is all those...

18:58.104 --> 19:01.340
sexual fantasies that he had,
they're all mixed up, right?

19:01.342 --> 19:04.075
They're like this burrito,
mushed together.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.578
It'll always be an amazing
Claire jerk burrito...

19:06.580 --> 19:08.513
when they're all together, but
if you take that burrito apart..

19:08.515 --> 19:10.449
you take that shit apart and you
just eat the corn...

19:10.451 --> 19:13.184
it's just fucking corn, Dougie,
Claire is fucking corn.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.388
She is boring.

19:16.956 --> 19:20.225
Wait, so you're... so you're
saying that real, live Claire...

19:20.227 --> 19:21.626
will never live up to the
fantasy Claire...

19:21.628 --> 19:23.428
he's created in his head.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.298
Exactly!
Wow!

19:26.300 --> 19:27.965
Yeah, they're doomed
before they even start.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.568
Dude, that's a really
deep way of putting it.

19:29.570 --> 19:32.537
That is six years of college,
my man.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.939
Who's wasting money now?

19:34.941 --> 19:36.310
Not you, Dad.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.412
Just calm down.
No!

19:40.414 --> 19:43.482
No, I am not dealing with
this erectile dysfunction shit.

19:43.484 --> 19:45.584
No! I told you I don't have
a problem down there.

19:45.586 --> 19:47.486
Oh really? We all know what
happens to you when you drink.

19:47.488 --> 19:49.153
Ssh!

19:49.155 --> 19:51.256
You know it's... I
sometimes have a problem.

19:51.258 --> 19:54.024
We haven't had sex
in a month, Grant!

19:54.026 --> 19:55.025
And I want it tonight!

19:55.027 --> 19:56.361
Okay, okay.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.531
So no drinking until
I'm serviced down there.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.099
It's the fucking luau, baby.

20:02.101 --> 20:05.102
Oh no, are you saying that this
party is more important than me?

20:05.104 --> 20:06.971
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I'm not.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.274
I'm not saying that at all.
Okay, good, good.

20:09.276 --> 20:12.277
Now we know you won't
fuck up what we have.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.045
Ugh, be a man and take care
of your girlfriend properly.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.047
I mean maybe you should
have some of my dad's Viagra.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.216
Oh, God.

20:18.218 --> 20:22.587
And... in, okay, hand me
another one.

20:22.589 --> 20:27.426
So, my first fuckin' luau, my
job was bathroom attendant...

20:27.428 --> 20:30.562
and they had this like Hawaiian
buffet.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.197
Everybody got food poisoning and
I had to keep the toilets...

20:33.199 --> 20:35.333
flushed and clean with this
like...

20:36.770 --> 20:39.304
Claire, hi.
Hi.

20:39.306 --> 20:42.207
Uh...
Uh, where should I put these?

20:42.209 --> 20:45.176
Um... what are they?

20:45.178 --> 20:46.311
Glow sticks.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.213
Oh, shit!

20:48.215 --> 20:50.549
Don't move, don't move,
don't move. Are you okay?

20:50.551 --> 20:53.050
There's glass everywhere.
No, I'm okay. Yeah no, I'm okay.

20:53.052 --> 20:56.354
Okay, let me... I'll
I'll... I will just uh....

20:56.356 --> 20:58.490
Ah, okay, ooh.
I can, yeah, I got you.

20:58.492 --> 21:00.525
Okay.
I can help you out.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.126
Oh, thank you.
Uh...

21:02.128 --> 21:04.329
Oh, perfect, right next
to my shoes.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.031
Yeah, I guess I could've grabbed
those...

21:07.033 --> 21:08.433
and just given them to you.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.402
Oh no, thank you.

21:10.404 --> 21:12.206
Okay, bye.
Yeah, bye.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.641
Bye.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.544
Future Dougie, this is uh,
young Dougie from college.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.046
I'd like to apologize for what
I'm about to do...

21:22.048 --> 21:23.682
to your body tonight.

21:23.684 --> 21:25.684
Hopefully there's not too many
long-lasting medical...

21:25.686 --> 21:31.258
repercussions, but if there are,
just know it was so worth it.

21:33.393 --> 21:38.164
Hm... hm.

21:43.303 --> 21:49.710
A hidden room, lots of lights,
and Tanner's cup... hm.

21:57.116 --> 22:00.619
Does this does this
look like a letter here?

22:00.621 --> 22:05.259
Um... looks like an H maybe?

22:07.159 --> 22:09.630
An H?

22:10.731 --> 22:13.298
O.

22:13.300 --> 22:18.737
An S... maybe there's a P.

22:18.739 --> 22:21.475
That's maybe... maybe an E.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.613
S!

22:28.849 --> 22:30.749
Hopes!

22:30.751 --> 22:33.518
I-I think it's hospice.

22:33.520 --> 22:37.222
Hospice! That sounds Chinese.
What does that mean?

22:37.224 --> 22:39.824
No idea, sir,
I think it's Latin.

22:39.826 --> 22:45.397
Computer, what does hospice
mean? Probably Chinese.

22:45.399 --> 22:53.072
Okay, hospice derives from the
Latin hospes meaning guest.

22:56.343 --> 22:58.679
Maybe this place was a hotel.

23:24.471 --> 23:28.275
Ha-ha, very funny,
guys, turn the lights back on!

23:30.577 --> 23:32.412
Shit.

23:37.918 --> 23:41.187
Oh hell, shit.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.156
Hello?

23:45.292 --> 23:48.362
Hello? Man, what's...

23:51.565 --> 23:53.867
Get your ass.

23:55.936 --> 23:58.637
What the fuck is...?

23:58.639 --> 24:00.574
Oh, shit!

24:03.910 --> 24:05.744
Wiggles!

24:05.746 --> 24:08.480
Unless you wanna see what a
high-fiber diet looks like...

24:08.482 --> 24:11.916
I suggest you get the fuck out
of my bathroom.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.985
Yes, sir... shit.

24:13.987 --> 24:16.855
Okay, so are you gonna stay out
and party with us tonight...

24:16.857 --> 24:18.690
or are you gonna ditch out like
you always do?

24:18.692 --> 24:20.525
Yeah, I'll hang out
for a little bit...

24:20.527 --> 24:22.494
but I've got that 5k cancer walk
thing tomorrow morning.

24:22.496 --> 24:24.763
Ugh, Jesus Christ, how
convenient.

24:24.765 --> 24:27.532
What? I'm representing our
entire sorority.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.001
You know, we do more
than just party.

24:30.003 --> 24:31.503
Sup, ladies? How we doin'?

24:31.505 --> 24:33.004
Oh, good, how are you?

24:33.006 --> 24:35.807
I'm just fuckin'
killin' it, you know.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.976
I'm just finishing
putting the roofies in.

24:37.978 --> 24:39.379
Ooh.
Yeah.

24:42.416 --> 24:46.885
Oh, goddamn, I am so
aroused right now!

24:46.887 --> 24:48.255
Let me try this.

24:54.928 --> 24:58.263
You know, I gotta say it's a
little fuckin' tame for me.

24:58.265 --> 24:59.431
Oh.
Mm-hm.

24:59.433 --> 25:00.932
Claire, you wanna give it a try?

25:00.934 --> 25:03.001
Oh, no, no, no, I'm good,
thank you.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.870
Oh, shocker, she's such a
fuckin' lightweight, right, T?

25:05.872 --> 25:09.908
Totally. You know who else
is a lightweight? Jason.

25:09.910 --> 25:11.743
But Jason...
Oh my God.

25:11.745 --> 25:14.946
Claire, Jason... Jason,
he's a babyweight, you know?

25:14.948 --> 25:16.948
Oh my god, Mags, think about
that.

25:16.950 --> 25:20.919
Claire, Jason, am I right?!

25:20.921 --> 25:22.721
Oh, my god, no.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.389
Alright, well I think this was a
really good and productive talk.

25:24.391 --> 25:26.458
Thank you for your example.

25:26.460 --> 25:27.592
You're welcome.

25:27.594 --> 25:31.563
I'll just I'm here for you.

25:31.565 --> 25:33.031
He is so quiche.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.999
Oh God, I do not understand
what you see in him.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.769
Yeah, you wouldn't because
you don't like masculine men.

25:37.771 --> 25:40.371
What?! That's not true.

25:40.373 --> 25:44.342
Claire, you like guys who
rollerblade...

25:44.344 --> 25:45.543
and play fucking Frisbee games.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.878
I do not!

25:46.880 --> 25:49.547
Oh, really? Well, then
what about Jason?

25:49.549 --> 25:50.982
Are you trying to get it
in tonight?

25:50.984 --> 25:53.551
Ew, no, Maggie, there's no...
there's nothing...

25:53.553 --> 25:56.521
between me and Jason
or anybody at all.

25:56.523 --> 25:59.591
Come on! It is obvious that
he has a huge boner for you.

25:59.593 --> 26:00.558
No.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.026
And I can tell that you
have one for him, too.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.495
No.
Let me see.

26:03.497 --> 26:06.498
Oh my God, Claire!
I'm pressing charges.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.702
That thing is huge!
No. Stop! Stop!

26:14.407 --> 26:15.974
Pssst.

26:15.976 --> 26:17.742
Um, hi, can I help you?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.812
Did you just take my picture?

26:20.814 --> 26:24.883
Just wanted to show my mom what
my new girlfriend looks like.

26:24.885 --> 26:27.585
So what time do you
have to be back in heaven?

26:27.587 --> 26:29.387
Hell, fucking no!

26:29.389 --> 26:31.790
What the fuck are you doing
here?

26:31.792 --> 26:33.725
Why you C blocking me, bro?
No, no, no, no.

26:33.727 --> 26:35.593
You're supposed to be here
next weekend.

26:35.595 --> 26:36.961
You need to get the fuck out.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.797
Okay, I just rode eight hours
in a bus...

26:38.799 --> 26:40.932
that smelled like sliced onions,
I'm not going home.

26:40.934 --> 26:46.638
You told me this weekend, so
hand me another beer, grandpa.

26:46.640 --> 26:50.608
Let's go, adios, amigo!
Let's go, come on.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.777
- Hold this, sweetheart.
- Kick his ass, Tanner.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.012
Go.

26:54.014 --> 26:54.981
All right.

26:56.516 --> 26:58.650
Oh!

26:58.652 --> 27:00.552
How do you like that, huh?

27:00.554 --> 27:03.121
Okay, okay. Dude, it fuckin'
hurts!

27:03.123 --> 27:05.056
Say uncle. Say uncle.
Fuck you.

27:05.058 --> 27:07.625
Say uncle.
Uncle!

27:07.627 --> 27:09.093
That's embarrassing.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.462
Oh my God, who are you?
Those are some incredible moves.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.931
Name's Drew.

27:12.933 --> 27:14.833
Is it hot out here or
are your boobs just huge?

27:14.835 --> 27:16.534
Yeah, that's my
asshole little brother.

27:16.536 --> 27:18.403
He's gay actually, though,
sorry about that.

27:18.405 --> 27:21.606
He's so cute. I love
the freckles.

27:21.608 --> 27:22.943
Fuck.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.411
Guys, can you help me?

27:26.413 --> 27:28.849
Yeah, coming.

27:39.793 --> 27:41.693
What happened?

27:41.695 --> 27:43.895
Yeah, I'm not really sure.

27:43.897 --> 27:46.097
Has anyone gone in there?

27:46.099 --> 27:47.968
Yes, ma'am, they did.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.618
I'm gonna go get some
more ice.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.152
All right.

28:42.555 --> 28:46.658
Daphne? Uh, Daphne?

28:46.660 --> 28:49.095
Hey!
Don't touch me.

28:51.232 --> 28:52.899
Excuse you.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.842
Daphne!

29:04.844 --> 29:08.846
What the fuck is she doing?
I don't know.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.917
I mean, do you think she's okay?

29:15.755 --> 29:17.989
I-I've gotta... I've gotta
take this.

29:17.991 --> 29:19.459
Okay.

29:24.130 --> 29:28.300
Hello, hi, yeah, this is him.

29:28.302 --> 29:30.470
Okay. Yup.

29:32.706 --> 29:34.841
Yeah, I understand, yeah.

29:37.577 --> 29:39.546
All right.

29:43.250 --> 29:45.819
Yeah.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.992
So, honey, I left an outfit out
for you to wear tonight...

29:53.994 --> 29:56.594
and I will be really angry
if you don't wear it.

29:56.596 --> 29:58.162
That sounds great, baby,
I can't wait.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.932
Okay, remember, no alcohol,
I am serious.

30:00.934 --> 30:03.935
Yeah, just Peligrino,
lots of ice cubes.

30:03.937 --> 30:07.171
Oh, I just love you so much.
You're just so handsome.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.940
Oh, and that cute little ass!

30:08.942 --> 30:11.044
See ya.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.214
Six for six.

30:15.216 --> 30:21.085
Miracles happen every day and
they can even happen for you, T.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.121
Alright, you got this, man.

30:23.123 --> 30:24.122

30:25.825 --> 30:29.794
I need the support, man.
I appreciate the support!

30:29.796 --> 30:31.363
Sup, ladies?

30:31.365 --> 30:33.164
Silver medal in the long jump.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.334

cat with this tonight!

30:35.336 --> 30:36.834
Yeah, take that shit off.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.069
You are not leaving this floor.

30:38.071 --> 30:40.205
Dude.
Come on, no, no, no, no.

30:40.207 --> 30:41.739
Dude, can he stay in
your room tonight?

30:41.741 --> 30:43.708
I look, everybody knows that you
and this guy...

30:43.710 --> 30:44.876
are going to bed
with some dry dicks.

30:44.878 --> 30:47.312
Uh, no, it's not happening.

30:47.314 --> 30:49.080
What's the six for six?

30:49.082 --> 30:52.351
So, Tanner's had a menage
at the last five luaus.

30:52.353 --> 30:54.919
Like a threesome?
You're kidding.

30:54.921 --> 30:57.090
No, it's a fact. He put it
on Wikipedia.

31:00.060 --> 31:05.663
Oh no. Dude, come on!
Oh my God!

31:05.665 --> 31:07.131
You look like a douchebag.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.633
Thank you, thank you.

31:08.635 --> 31:11.002
Oh!
That's enough!

31:11.004 --> 31:12.904
My...! Oh!

31:12.906 --> 31:14.872
This is school spirit, alright?

31:14.874 --> 31:17.041
This is... this is what fuckin'
pride and devotion looks like.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.776
No, no, no, this is great.

31:18.778 --> 31:21.145
This is why you are the
president of our fraternity.

31:21.147 --> 31:23.083
Because of that.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.318
Yeah.

31:26.320 --> 31:29.256
Fuck, you guys, I'm taking
it off!

31:31.358 --> 31:34.192
Yo, all of these fish are dead.

31:34.194 --> 31:36.228
Yeah, yeah, I know, alright?
Just don't tell Tanner.

31:36.230 --> 31:37.662
I'm gonna get some new ones.

31:37.664 --> 31:39.264
Okay, we gotta get
downstairs, man.

31:39.266 --> 31:41.134
You gotta get dressed, you
gotta chill with the games.

31:43.103 --> 31:45.237
Yo! Dougie, come on, come on!

31:45.239 --> 31:46.904
Dude, have you ever looked
up the history of this house?

31:46.906 --> 31:49.241
Uh, no, why?

31:49.243 --> 31:51.709
Dude, people have been
killed here, like a lot.

31:51.711 --> 31:53.711
What? Really?

31:53.713 --> 31:55.314
Yeah, dude, back in the 60's,
before fraternity bought...

31:55.316 --> 31:57.748

William Sarken...

31:57.750 --> 31:59.717
had a dinner party and like
killed everyone.

31:59.719 --> 32:02.153
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you serious?

32:02.155 --> 32:04.423
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, even
himself, it was like...

32:04.425 --> 32:07.158

32:07.160 --> 32:09.160
Dude, like right here,

32:09.162 --> 32:12.163
Damn, does it say like
what room it was in or...?

32:12.165 --> 32:13.164
I don't know!

32:13.166 --> 32:14.832
Who cares, dude?

32:14.834 --> 32:16.701
I can't believe this
happened and we never knew this.

32:16.703 --> 32:19.036
Okay, well this shit is
a fuckin' buzzkill, okay?

32:19.038 --> 32:21.072
I don't wanna be
freaked out all night.

32:21.074 --> 32:25.009
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

32:25.011 --> 32:28.014
Yeah, okay, you're right.
Alright, it's a fuckin luau.

32:29.716 --> 32:32.484
Uh, hey, do you uh did
you hear any news yet?

32:32.486 --> 32:34.819
No, uh not yet.

32:34.821 --> 32:38.823
Well hang in there man, alright?
If anyone deserves it, it's you.

32:38.825 --> 32:41.726
Okay, security cam on.

32:41.728 --> 32:44.095
Uh, throw a towel over it if you
bring any honeys up, or don't.

32:44.097 --> 32:45.497
Okay, towel over camera.

32:45.499 --> 32:47.499
Okay, let's do this.
I love you, man.

32:47.501 --> 32:48.935
Dude, love you, bro.

32:56.776 --> 32:59.043
Alright, alright, alright,
listen up.

32:59.045 --> 33:02.180
We are about to kick off the
greatest party of the year.

33:02.182 --> 33:04.015
Mm-hm.
Oh yeah.

33:04.017 --> 33:07.219
Now I can't think of a better
group of guys to do that with...

33:07.221 --> 33:09.321
than the guys standing in this
room right now.

33:09.323 --> 33:11.155
That's right!

33:11.157 --> 33:14.226
But listen, this is the party
that every single student...

33:14.228 --> 33:16.961
on campus wants to be at.

33:16.963 --> 33:18.963
Yup. Yes!

33:18.965 --> 33:21.999
Now, that's a privilege,
but it's also a responsibility.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.769
Each and every one of you
motherfuckin' pledges...

33:24.771 --> 33:26.238
is gonna have a task tonight.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.540
Some of you are gonna tend
bar...

33:28.542 --> 33:32.176
some of you are gonna make sure
that our beaches are safe, okay?

33:32.178 --> 33:34.346
I'm sure that some of you think
that this is gonna suck...

33:34.348 --> 33:35.447
'cause you're gonna be working
all night.

33:35.449 --> 33:37.449
No way.
You're wrong.

33:37.451 --> 33:41.185
Alright? We've all had shitty
jobs, we were pledges once.

33:41.187 --> 33:46.824
But so long as you do what
you're told, we are maybe...

33:46.826 --> 33:49.461
gonna consider letting you be
one step closer...

33:49.463 --> 33:51.929
to being brothers of Sigma Tau.

33:57.371 --> 33:58.869
Shit, man!

33:58.871 --> 34:00.205
It's not coming from me.
What is that?

34:00.207 --> 34:02.073
What's that, you, uh, need my
help?

34:02.075 --> 34:06.110
Jesus! What the fuck, dude?!
You are not to come down here!

34:06.112 --> 34:09.179
You're sixteen! You keep
your ass upstairs!

34:09.181 --> 34:11.416
Look, if anyone sees that
motherfucker coming down here...

34:11.418 --> 34:14.885
you have my permission, you put
his ass upstairs, okay?

34:14.887 --> 34:16.521
It might take a couple of you
to do it...

34:16.523 --> 34:20.123
because he's retard-strong,
but you keep him up there.

34:20.126 --> 34:23.928
Man, I am really disappointed
in the loser you have become.

34:23.929 --> 34:28.899
To think you used to
be my best friend.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.369
Jesus Christ.

35:45.312 --> 35:48.280
Ow! You look fucking amazing.

35:48.282 --> 35:50.315
Do you wanna go upstairs
right now, huh?

35:50.317 --> 35:52.149
No, why?
What do you mean?

35:52.151 --> 35:54.286
Let's... let's go, you know,
let's go.

35:54.288 --> 35:57.088
Grant, I literally just got
here.

35:57.090 --> 36:00.091
It's gonna take two seconds.
Come on, let's go.

36:00.093 --> 36:02.159
Oh okay, well that's not
romantic at all.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.596
Baby, what do you mean? I just
wanna make you feel good.

36:04.598 --> 36:05.996
Come on.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.932
Please! You have to get
me in the mood!

36:07.934 --> 36:09.501
I'm totally turned off
right now.

36:09.503 --> 36:12.169
Wh-wh-why aren't you
in the mood?

36:12.171 --> 36:14.475
Because you're disgusting
as fuck.

36:26.387 --> 36:30.624
Go Wiggles! Go Wiggles!
Go Wiggles! Go Wiggles!

36:35.061 --> 36:40.199
Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead.
Dead. All dead.

36:50.411 --> 36:52.143
Sup, amigo?!

36:52.145 --> 36:54.312
Crawling in that secret
passageway shit is awesome!

36:54.314 --> 36:55.547
Whoa! What are you doing, dude?

36:55.549 --> 36:57.382
Get back in there
before Tanner sees you.

36:57.384 --> 37:00.017
Oh no, man. I didn't come all
this way to just sit on my ass.

37:00.019 --> 37:01.620
I'm ready to partay.

37:01.622 --> 37:04.322
Dude, do you wanna be the
person that gets us shut down?

37:04.324 --> 37:06.056
Huh?

37:06.058 --> 37:09.160
What the fuck are you doing?!
Dude, stop!

37:09.162 --> 37:12.196
I'm beesin', bro. It tingles.

37:12.198 --> 37:14.200
It's tight. Oh!

37:16.437 --> 37:18.169

37:18.171 --> 37:20.639
Okay. Shit. Alright, okay, okay,

37:20.641 --> 37:23.542
I have an idea. Come on.

37:23.544 --> 37:25.410
Nobody will see you.

37:25.412 --> 37:29.414
Do what you want, but look,
don't take the head off.

37:29.416 --> 37:31.683
Alright.
Promise me.

37:31.685 --> 37:33.017
I promise.
Okay.

37:33.019 --> 37:34.151
Bro.
Alright.

37:34.153 --> 37:35.787
You're the brother I wish I had.

37:35.789 --> 37:38.323
I will never forget you for
looking out for me like this.

37:38.325 --> 37:41.961
Never ever.
Yeah, man, for sure.

37:46.233 --> 37:47.632
Alright, that's good.

37:47.634 --> 37:49.166
Long enough.

37:49.168 --> 37:51.168

38:30.109 --> 38:33.311
Oh, them? Yeah.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.347
What's wrong?
They're just fucking losers.

38:35.349 --> 38:38.316
What the fuck, dude?
Dougie, what are you doing?

38:38.318 --> 38:40.318
Uh, nothing.

38:56.770 --> 38:58.168

39:33.307 --> 39:34.741
Shame you have to sit on it.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.270
Maybe it went to his junk mail.

40:39.272 --> 40:40.905
Well, he said he'll find a place
for you at the fund...

40:40.907 --> 40:42.741
so you shouldn't worry.

40:42.743 --> 40:44.743
I really want
this to work, okay?

40:44.745 --> 40:46.211
Going out into the real world
and leaving college...

40:46.213 --> 40:47.545
it's... it's scary, baby.

40:47.547 --> 40:49.347
Can you just stop stressing out?

40:49.349 --> 40:51.650
As long as we're good,
everything with my daddy's fine.

40:51.652 --> 40:53.887
I love you so much.

40:55.756 --> 40:57.355
Wanna go to my room?

40:57.357 --> 41:00.460
Who invited those
fucking KZB bitches?

41:01.862 --> 41:04.396
Did you just
fucking wave at her?!

41:04.398 --> 41:05.697
Baby, I'm being hospitable.

41:05.699 --> 41:08.333
Her vagina's hospitable.

41:08.335 --> 41:10.001
I can't believe you
used to fuck that bitch.

41:10.003 --> 41:11.970
That was before I met you!

41:11.972 --> 41:15.809
Oh yeah, right, hardly. What a
disgusting whore, I can't.

41:19.513 --> 41:22.616
What? Wait. Hey. Wait.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.584
Wait, what do you mean
all the ice is melted?

41:26.586 --> 41:29.921
It's just water now.

41:29.923 --> 41:32.557
I was just gone for a second,
I swear.

41:32.559 --> 41:35.827
Okay, look, go find Grant, tell
him we need emergency ice.

41:35.829 --> 41:37.028
Okay.
Alright?

41:37.030 --> 41:40.534
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
Fast. Faster.

41:58.552 --> 42:00.685
Who's there?

42:00.687 --> 42:02.756
Who's back there?

42:11.765 --> 42:14.267
The basement's off limits.

42:36.990 --> 42:39.726
Is there someone with me
right now?

42:48.468 --> 42:50.270
Did you come from
the hidden room?

43:00.580 --> 43:02.647
Whippits, bro.

43:02.649 --> 43:04.916
Fucking dickhead! Fuck!

43:04.918 --> 43:06.720
I love 'em.

43:42.856 --> 43:45.023
One Mississippi, two
Mississippi...

43:45.025 --> 43:48.728
three Mississippi, four
Mississippi, five Mississippi.

43:51.431 --> 43:52.797
Do you need a drink?

43:52.799 --> 43:54.532
Oh, no, no, it's okay,
I can get it.

43:54.534 --> 43:57.569
No, no, no. I can grab it
for you.

43:57.571 --> 43:58.803
Oh, uh yeah, yeah, just a water
though.

43:58.805 --> 44:00.071
Vodka?
Water.

44:00.073 --> 44:01.072
Water.
Water, water.

44:01.074 --> 44:02.674
Water, okay.

44:02.676 --> 44:04.442
I have to wake up early for this
thing tomorrow and...

44:04.444 --> 44:06.811
so I uh... why I can't really...
not that it matters.

44:06.813 --> 44:09.049
Okay, water, it's water.

44:10.417 --> 44:12.550
Here you go.
Thanks.

44:12.552 --> 44:18.957
Uh so what... what are... what are
you gonna do after graduation?

44:18.959 --> 44:22.560
Oh, uh, a family friend of mine
is a politician...

44:22.562 --> 44:24.028
so I might go work for them
for a little while.

44:24.030 --> 44:26.731
Wait, a what?
A politician.

44:26.733 --> 44:27.866
A politician, okay.

44:27.868 --> 44:29.033
So I might do something
with them...

44:29.035 --> 44:31.203
but um, I don't really know.

44:31.205 --> 44:34.539
I'm still figuring it all
out, but um what about you?

44:34.541 --> 44:36.841
Do you know what you're
gonna...

44:36.843 --> 44:40.044
Um, well, I-I actually
got into medical school.

44:40.046 --> 44:44.916
Holy shit! Wow! Congratulations!
That's amazing.

44:44.918 --> 44:49.721
Thank you. Thank you.

44:49.723 --> 44:51.556
Wow.

44:51.558 --> 44:53.858
Yeah, the Dean, he called me
earlier...

44:53.860 --> 44:56.594
and you're the first
person I told.

44:56.596 --> 44:59.163
Oh that's that's really amazing.

44:59.165 --> 45:01.733
I didn't even know you
wanted to be a doctor.

45:01.735 --> 45:04.502
I'm thinking probably
pediatrics.

45:04.504 --> 45:06.070
You know, I love kids.

45:06.072 --> 45:08.473
Not like in a weird way, I
just like to play with them.

45:08.475 --> 45:10.942
No like I like to...
Claire!

45:10.944 --> 45:13.077
Oh my God! Get down here and
dance with us! Oh, yeah.

45:13.079 --> 45:17.782
Okay, okay, wait. Um, uh,
I'm so happy for you.

45:17.784 --> 45:20.184
Okay, yeah, see ya.

45:20.186 --> 45:22.053
Oh. Oh.

45:22.055 --> 45:23.621
Oh.

45:23.623 --> 45:25.757
Congratulations, Jason.

45:25.759 --> 45:28.695
Thank you, Wiggles.

45:37.570 --> 45:38.937
Bedrooms are safe, sir.

45:38.939 --> 45:41.208
Good work, Nascar.

45:43.009 --> 45:44.978
Left turns only.

45:51.618 --> 45:53.184
Yo, get out of
this goddamn dungeon.

45:53.186 --> 45:55.019
Hey.
I've been texting you.

45:55.021 --> 45:56.955
Come on, the party's fucking
great downstairs, okay?

45:56.957 --> 45:59.291
Hey, can I show you something?
No, where's the prank video?

45:59.293 --> 46:01.592
No, no, no, you don't need to
know about the prank video.

46:01.594 --> 46:03.761
You need to see this.
Check this out.

46:03.763 --> 46:05.598
Aw man.
Okay, watch this.

46:08.168 --> 46:10.735
Oh shit, Tanner's
little brother.

46:10.737 --> 46:13.871
That! Right there!
You see that behind him?

46:13.873 --> 46:17.008
See what?
Okay, watch again.

46:17.010 --> 46:19.546
Right here, alright? Right here
in this corner, watch.

46:25.719 --> 46:27.652
I didn't see anything.

46:27.654 --> 46:29.687
Dude! Right here! Look, look.

46:29.689 --> 46:31.756
You see that dark spot
right there?

46:31.758 --> 46:32.957
The shadow?

46:32.959 --> 46:35.327
Dude! That is not a shadow, man!

46:35.329 --> 46:37.762
Okay, I need the prank video,
though.

46:37.764 --> 46:39.331
This is great, but I need...

46:39.333 --> 46:40.999
You're acting fuckin' crazy
right now.

46:41.001 --> 46:42.301
I don't know what
you're talking about.

46:42.303 --> 46:43.701
Who the fuck cares
about a prank video?

46:43.703 --> 46:45.237
You need to come to your senses.

46:45.239 --> 46:48.840
Dude, you love all of
this UFO conspiracy shit.

46:48.842 --> 46:51.042
Yeah, alright. Yeah, I do.

46:51.044 --> 46:52.910
But I have facts about
this Sarken guy.

46:52.912 --> 46:54.679
Now the library has all the
newspapers...

46:54.681 --> 46:56.281
hidden from the 60's.
Okay, right.

46:56.283 --> 47:00.252
Okay, look at this pic.
There's Sarken, right there.

47:00.254 --> 47:02.954
Check this, look what
he's holding.

47:02.956 --> 47:05.990
Okay...
Boom! Tanner's cup! Right there!

47:05.992 --> 47:10.595
Okay, so he lived here and
Tanner found his cup. So what?

47:10.597 --> 47:12.597
No, this guy was fucked up, man!

47:12.599 --> 47:14.599
I mean thank God he beat his kid
and she wasn't here...

47:14.601 --> 47:16.268
when he killed those 13 people.

47:16.270 --> 47:18.237
Okay, I'm actually impressed
with all of this research...

47:18.239 --> 47:20.738
man, but what does it have
to do with the shadow?

47:20.740 --> 47:22.675
What was the only class
I ever got an A in?

47:25.045 --> 47:26.144
Religious studies.

47:26.146 --> 47:28.112
Bingo!

47:28.114 --> 47:29.914
Okay, so you're saying
the house is haunted?

47:29.916 --> 47:31.883
Dougie, man, come on.
I'm not saying that exactly...

47:31.885 --> 47:34.185
No, yo, don't start! Come on!
You're being fucking crazy.

47:34.187 --> 47:36.288
Am I? I don't know. Maybe
I'm... maybe I'm crazy.

47:36.290 --> 47:38.223
Why was the cup sitting
all by itself...

47:38.225 --> 47:40.725
in a room surrounded
by lights?

47:40.727 --> 47:42.660
That's actually a good question.
Ask me tomorrow.

47:42.662 --> 47:44.862
Ask me tomorr...
Jason!

47:44.864 --> 47:46.964
Yo.
What's up, Dougie?

47:46.966 --> 47:50.101
It's time to light it up.
Let's fuckin' do it!

47:50.103 --> 47:55.073
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

47:55.075 --> 47:57.242
Ah, you know what?
You do the honors.

47:57.244 --> 47:58.776
Okay.

47:58.778 --> 48:01.913
But first things first,
ladies and gentlemen...

48:01.915 --> 48:05.618
my boy Jason just
got into medical school.

48:14.060 --> 48:15.993
Plug her in.

48:55.702 --> 49:00.272
Mommy, Daddy, and I just wanted
to say that I love you guys...

49:00.274 --> 49:03.774
and I love the chase you beer
with, a lot.

49:03.776 --> 49:07.979
And I think I wanna get fucked
up every night of the week.

49:07.981 --> 49:11.149
I think I'm gonna try coke now.

49:11.151 --> 49:13.987
Oh shit. Aw.

49:57.063 --> 49:59.364
Oh shit.

49:59.366 --> 50:01.165
Poor bunny.

50:59.293 --> 51:02.762
Ow! God! Dammit!

51:06.199 --> 51:08.065
Jesus, it's dark.

51:08.067 --> 51:11.470
All right, okay, let's just get
out of here, let's go.

51:11.472 --> 51:14.208
Okay, fuse box.

51:16.577 --> 51:18.477
Okay.

51:18.479 --> 51:21.912
It's normal, it's an old house,
they have rooms like that.

51:21.914 --> 51:24.148
They stored coal for heating
and...

51:24.150 --> 51:26.285
Yeah, yeah, that's really
normal.

51:26.287 --> 51:27.985
Yeah, just chill and let me
see that light.

51:27.987 --> 51:30.990
I think the fuse box is
somewhere... somewhere over here.

51:42.269 --> 51:43.237
Fuck!

51:45.339 --> 51:47.807
Okay. All right, okay, jumpy,
a little jumpy.

51:51.211 --> 51:53.110
Okay, okay.
Holy shit.

51:53.112 --> 51:56.113
Hey, you remember these?
Oh my God, yes.

51:56.115 --> 51:58.049
So okay, when we were pledges...

51:58.051 --> 52:01.286
they made us sleep down here
for like a week.

52:01.288 --> 52:04.155
It was a week, right?
Yeah.

52:04.157 --> 52:07.158
Man, we got soft. We need to
step it up.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.560
Okay, alright.

52:08.562 --> 52:10.961
Yo, it's back here.

52:10.963 --> 52:13.097
Of course.
Get the fuck out!

52:13.099 --> 52:16.167
Shit, Wiggles, uh, look
for night vision in the menu.

52:16.169 --> 52:18.169
Hurry up, come on, hurry up.

52:18.171 --> 52:20.539
I found it,
and I can see.

52:20.541 --> 52:24.309
Okay, hand me the camera.

52:24.311 --> 52:27.579
Agh!

52:27.581 --> 52:29.080
- What? What happened?!
- Shit, shit.

52:29.082 --> 52:30.515
What the fuck is going on?

52:30.517 --> 52:33.117
Wiggles, where are you?
Dude, say something.

52:33.119 --> 52:35.154
Shit.

52:38.392 --> 52:41.326
I'm sorry. I saw something.

52:41.328 --> 52:44.195
Where?
Right behind you.

52:44.197 --> 52:45.397
Wait, what did you see?

52:45.399 --> 52:46.997
What did it look like?

52:46.999 --> 52:48.700
I don't know. It was fuckin'
freaky.

52:48.702 --> 52:51.703
You see! I told you!
There's something down here.

52:51.705 --> 52:54.439
Let's see what you saw.

52:54.441 --> 52:55.440
Come on!

52:55.442 --> 53:00.247
Okay, rewind. Rewind. And...

53:01.715 --> 53:04.115
And...

53:08.222 --> 53:09.721
Nothing.

53:09.723 --> 53:13.358
What the fuck, Wiggles,
there's nothing there.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.126
I'm sorry, guys!

53:15.128 --> 53:17.729
See, Dougie, you're
freaking everybody out, okay?

53:17.731 --> 53:19.731
No more weed, you're paranoid.

53:19.733 --> 53:22.334
Let's go upstairs, we'll do a
shot. This is the fuckin' luau.

53:22.336 --> 53:24.569
I mean, this is stupid,
we should be having fun.

53:24.571 --> 53:27.138
Okay.
Okay?

53:27.140 --> 53:28.707
Yeah, all right, okay.

53:28.709 --> 53:31.108
Man.

53:31.110 --> 53:32.246
Wait.

53:35.416 --> 53:36.650
What is that?

53:44.691 --> 53:46.460
Just...

53:49.696 --> 53:52.999
Holy... okay.

53:55.001 --> 53:56.334
Let's go in.
No! No way, dude.

53:56.336 --> 53:57.769
I'm actually scared, dude.

53:57.771 --> 53:59.337
I'm like really scared,
like I could shit myself.

53:59.339 --> 54:01.339
No! You need to see
that this is nothing.

54:01.341 --> 54:04.476
God, I hate when you
do this shit.

54:04.478 --> 54:08.145
You're not ruining my night,
okay? We're goin' in.

54:08.147 --> 54:10.116
Fuck... okay.

54:15.456 --> 54:17.291
Oh, fuck.

54:22.028 --> 54:23.562
Whoa.

54:23.564 --> 54:25.764
Yeah, no more weed for me.

54:25.766 --> 54:27.701
Just your normal coal cellar.

54:29.336 --> 54:30.335
This is weird.

54:30.337 --> 54:31.770
This is really weird.

54:31.772 --> 54:34.241
Maybe they're sleep
depriving the pledges?

54:36.175 --> 54:39.076
Or maybe they were trying to
build a room with no shadows...

54:39.078 --> 54:41.080
I'm just saying.

54:43.049 --> 54:44.251
Wait, look.

54:45.786 --> 54:47.419
All right, turn it on. Turn it
back on. Turn it back on.

54:47.421 --> 54:49.086
Agh!

54:50.156 --> 54:51.456
Okay, okay.

54:51.458 --> 54:53.258
I'm glad you think this
is funny.

54:53.260 --> 54:56.661
No, this is all suspect, but I'm
sure Grant can find out...

54:56.663 --> 54:58.463
what this was and put your
theory to rest...

54:58.465 --> 55:02.099
but I'm telling you,
it's nothing.

55:02.101 --> 55:06.238
Okay, we'll just... wait, okay,
wait, wait.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.706
Ouch.

55:07.708 --> 55:12.277
I call that one the
rubber lover.

55:12.279 --> 55:14.078
It's so amazing.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.548
Yeah, you're a great artist.

55:16.550 --> 55:18.216
Yeah, it's... it's crazy.

55:18.218 --> 55:20.385
It's... it's actually
clay and feathers.

55:20.387 --> 55:22.320
Wow.
Yeah.

55:22.322 --> 55:24.823
Hey, you guys wanna
do another line?

55:24.825 --> 55:27.091
Yes, please, yes, yes, yes.

55:27.093 --> 55:29.327
Oh, well, excellent.

55:29.329 --> 55:33.565
Here, I'll give this to you.

55:33.567 --> 55:36.268
I know that...

55:36.270 --> 55:39.103
you didn't come up here just
to talk art and do coke.

55:39.105 --> 55:40.839
We came up here to
look at your sculpture.

55:40.841 --> 55:42.574
Uh...

55:42.576 --> 55:44.309
I think you came up here
for a little more than that.

55:44.311 --> 55:46.378
What do you mean?

55:46.380 --> 55:50.715
Lesbi-honest... with each other.

55:50.717 --> 55:54.786
I like you, I do.

55:54.788 --> 55:56.356
I fuck... I like you.

55:58.492 --> 56:04.331
And... I like you.

56:10.470 --> 56:12.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, settle down,
ladies, come on.

56:12.171 --> 56:15.507
Settle down, all right?

56:15.509 --> 56:19.611
There's enough T
for the both of you.

56:20.781 --> 56:24.351
Now, let me see you kiss
and make out.

56:33.226 --> 56:35.627
See, now we're all friends.

56:35.629 --> 56:37.596
Look, I'm just gonna do another
little bump...

56:37.598 --> 56:41.700
and then we'll really get
this party started.

56:41.702 --> 56:42.803
Yeah?

56:44.237 --> 56:46.271
What the fuck?

56:46.273 --> 56:49.307
Ladies, I know I'm ripped, but
let's just play gentle, okay?

56:49.309 --> 56:50.677
Whatever, come on.

56:54.281 --> 56:55.549
Oh shit.

56:56.617 --> 56:59.453
Ah fuck, ah fuck, come here.

57:02.522 --> 57:04.358
Oh my God.

57:09.296 --> 57:10.497
Oh yeah.

57:20.707 --> 57:23.408
Whoa! Fuck!

57:23.410 --> 57:25.243
What did you do to him?
Did you use your teeth?

57:25.245 --> 57:26.578
No! Of course not! I know
what I'm doing!

57:26.580 --> 57:28.446
What the fuck?

57:28.448 --> 57:31.549
Do you fuckin... you fuck... you
it was... it was looking at me.

57:31.551 --> 57:33.618
It was right here.
Okay, um...

57:33.620 --> 57:36.755
There was a... it was
um... it was right here.

57:36.757 --> 57:38.657
It was fucking looking at me.

57:38.659 --> 57:40.425
This just got really weird.

57:40.427 --> 57:45.430
Yeah, right, it got fucking
weird! What was that?

57:45.432 --> 57:46.998
Hey, do you wanna go
back to the party?

57:47.000 --> 57:48.500
Yes, and thank you for the
laced coke...

57:48.502 --> 57:50.402
I cannot wait to start
hallucinating.

57:50.404 --> 57:53.304
No, I thought I saw the uh,
fuck, hold on, don't go, no.

57:53.306 --> 57:54.506
Yeah, I don't think so.

57:54.508 --> 57:56.307
Let's do another line, I got
a big dick, my dick's huge.

57:56.309 --> 57:57.709
I'm sure you do.

57:57.711 --> 58:00.247
Let's play with it, fuck,
what the fuck!

58:02.249 --> 58:04.251
<i>It was a
joke. That's Dougie, man.</i>

58:06.453 --> 58:08.655
<i>Let's hide the fuckin' body,
Wiggles!</i>

58:17.597 --> 58:19.030
That was pretty quick.

58:19.032 --> 58:21.766
Yeah. Six for six?
This guy's fuckin' wild.

58:21.768 --> 58:23.935
Let's say tonight's not over.

58:23.937 --> 58:26.504
Are you kidding? Liza said
those girls are sluts.

58:26.506 --> 58:28.273
Yeah, they're fucking nuts,
Grant.

58:28.275 --> 58:29.974
Okay.
Take this shit.

58:29.976 --> 58:32.744
No, no, I don't....
Oh, I'll... yeah, I'll take it.

58:32.746 --> 58:34.448
I gotta get fucked up.

58:35.449 --> 58:36.748
Weird.

59:39.079 --> 59:40.879
Hi, can I get a sangria, please?

59:40.881 --> 59:42.881
Whatcha' want?
A sangria.

59:42.883 --> 59:44.317
You got it.

59:51.825 --> 59:53.426
Thank you.

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:11.444
Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:14.414 --> 01:00:18.819
<i>Horrificum.</i>

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:23.655
<i>Horrificum Hospes....</i>

01:00:23.657 --> 01:00:25.625
<i>Horrificum Hospes.</i>

01:00:40.774 --> 01:00:43.608
You need to hurry up
and get over there.

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:44.709
Hm?

01:00:44.711 --> 01:00:46.611
You two are so annoying!

01:00:46.613 --> 01:00:48.079
Stop being such a puss.

01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:50.448
Go over there and change that
girl's life.

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:52.517
Unless you like dudes.
You like dudes?

01:00:52.519 --> 01:00:54.052
No.

01:00:54.054 --> 01:00:56.154
If you like dudes, that's fine,
I get it, I love dudes.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:57.889
I've been eyeing
these dudes all night.

01:00:57.891 --> 01:00:59.691
What do you think of that guy?
He's hot, right?

01:00:59.693 --> 01:01:01.561
Looks like he really
knows how to kiss a girl.

01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:05.866
Okay.

01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:10.168
Fuck it. Thank you, man.

01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:38.796
Hm.
Okay, all right, here we go.

01:01:38.798 --> 01:01:40.098
Ah, this is old school.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:44.068
Is there a date?
Uh... June 1974.

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:49.507
Okay, it's an interview with
Sarken's daughter, Miranda.

01:01:49.509 --> 01:01:52.644
Okay, so Miranda Sarken says
that her home life...

01:01:52.646 --> 01:01:54.145
deteriorated when her father
came back...

01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:56.681
from a research trip in Europe.

01:01:56.683 --> 01:02:00.618
He feared the dark,
he would never sleep.

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.588
That would explain the crazy
light room in the basement!

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:05.623
Fucking A, okay, all right,
all right.

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:07.759
Like a panic room.

01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:10.061
So as a child, her mother
drowned in a swimming pool...

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:12.096
accident, was pronounced dead,
and then...

01:02:12.098 --> 01:02:15.133
en route to the hospital
miraculously woke up.

01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:16.968
She came back to life.

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:21.806
Shit, man, this family, see how
I've been following the clues?

01:02:21.808 --> 01:02:24.809
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:27.011
I should be an FBI agent,
not a fucking teacher.

01:02:27.013 --> 01:02:30.581
Okay, child services removed her
from the home after finding...

01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:33.985
severe scratches and bruises
across her torso at school.

01:02:33.987 --> 01:02:36.288
Miranda says her father never
hurt her...

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.923
and her parents were good
people.

01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:40.992
Before she was placed with her
aunt, her mother said...

01:02:40.994 --> 01:02:44.296
her father was influenced by
a demon and that he invited...

01:02:44.298 --> 01:02:46.597
the horrifying guest
into their home.

01:02:46.599 --> 01:02:49.803
She didn't believe her father
took all those poor souls.

01:02:51.905 --> 01:02:54.306
Dude.

01:02:54.308 --> 01:02:57.775
<i>Horrificum Hospes.</i> Come on!
What?!

01:02:57.777 --> 01:03:00.812
Holy shit! Okay, okay.
What do we do?

01:03:00.814 --> 01:03:02.214
About what?

01:03:02.216 --> 01:03:04.716
What? There's a fucking
demon in the house, man!

01:03:04.718 --> 01:03:06.718
What the fuck?! Oh fuck.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.253
Dougie, man, you've
been smoking all night.

01:03:08.255 --> 01:03:10.088
No.

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.956
I thought I saw something but
I don't know if it was anything.

01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:14.559
No, no, no, no, no,
we gotta go, we gotta...

01:03:14.561 --> 01:03:17.595
Fuck, we gotta go, man.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

01:03:17.597 --> 01:03:18.798
Shit.

01:03:24.238 --> 01:03:26.604
Hey! Hey! Where's Jason? Have
you seen him?

01:03:26.606 --> 01:03:27.739
No, sir, I haven't.

01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:29.107
Okay look, go find Jason...

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:30.575
tell him I'm looking for him,
alright?

01:03:30.577 --> 01:03:32.112
We gotta get out of here,
all of us.

01:03:37.318 --> 01:03:39.083
Oh, I need another one.

01:03:39.085 --> 01:03:40.818
Oh my God.

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.820
Ugh baby, if you wanna hump
my leg at least do it...

01:03:42.822 --> 01:03:45.056
on the dance floor where
it's less embarrassing.

01:03:45.058 --> 01:03:47.226
Okay, why don't we go upstairs
to my room...

01:03:47.228 --> 01:03:49.027
where it's a little less
embarrassing?

01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:50.862
Wait, let me smell your breath.
Come here.

01:03:50.864 --> 01:03:52.163
Why?

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:54.699
Come here!
No.

01:03:54.701 --> 01:03:57.802
You asshole!
Liza, it was just one shot.

01:03:57.804 --> 01:03:59.371
It's fine, let's go to my room.

01:03:59.373 --> 01:04:01.240
I'm trying to give us
a special night.

01:04:01.242 --> 01:04:05.977
Just leave me the fuck alone.
Baby, hey...

01:04:05.979 --> 01:04:09.013
I said get the fuck away
from me, Grant!

01:04:09.015 --> 01:04:12.150
Okay, you know what?
You are fucking insane.

01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:15.153
I'm done with this, this is the
fucking luau, alright?!

01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:19.157
It's the best party of the year
and if I wanna drink...

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:20.925
oh, baby, I'm gonna drink.

01:04:20.927 --> 01:04:24.629
So get over it, bitch.

01:04:24.631 --> 01:04:28.733
Excuse me? Did you just
fucking call me a bitch?!

01:04:28.735 --> 01:04:30.902
Yes, he did.

01:04:30.904 --> 01:04:35.309
Fuck you, Grant, get out
of my fucking way!

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:47.386
Let's see... okay.

01:05:06.973 --> 01:05:08.005
Oh, Jesus! Nascar!

01:05:08.007 --> 01:05:10.007
Sir.

01:05:10.009 --> 01:05:12.043
Yo, you are not doing your job.
Sir?

01:05:12.045 --> 01:05:13.878
Get these people out of here.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.714
Oh my God, I'm so sorry, sir.
Guys, get the fuck out!

01:05:16.716 --> 01:05:19.418
What the fuck is this?!
Get out! Get out!

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.121
What the fuck?! Get your...

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:25.923
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:27.125
What are we drinking to?

01:05:27.127 --> 01:05:28.793
To old friends.

01:05:28.795 --> 01:05:31.398
Yeah, you used to fuck
each other. Ha!

01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:38.203
Thar she blows.

01:05:38.205 --> 01:05:41.772
Is your girlfriend gonna be mad
if she sees me talking to you?

01:05:41.774 --> 01:05:44.944
Liza? No. Fuck that bitch and
her dad, I don't need 'em.

01:05:48.982 --> 01:05:51.252
It's the fucking luau!

01:05:58.825 --> 01:06:00.825
Have you seen him?
Have you seen Jason?

01:06:00.827 --> 01:06:02.994
Maggie! Maggie! Maggie!
Maggie!

01:06:02.996 --> 01:06:04.762
Uh, I'm looking for Jason,
have you seen him?

01:06:04.764 --> 01:06:09.967
Dougie, listen to me right now.
You leave him the fuck alone.

01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:13.037
He is with my girl and
she has had a rough life.

01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:15.873
And if you beaver dam that shit
because of this shit...

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:18.310
because I can tell that you
are fucked up right now,

01:06:18.312 --> 01:06:21.946
I will come after you and I will
break your fucking legs...

01:06:21.948 --> 01:06:24.015
and I don't give a fuck about
getting kicked out of school.

01:06:24.017 --> 01:06:27.051
Don't fucking mess with my girl!

01:06:27.053 --> 01:06:31.358
So, no, I haven't seen him.
Cheers.

01:06:32.825 --> 01:06:35.161
Jason? Jason, you in there?

01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:38.263
Claire, I'm sorry for the
taco blocko...

01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:39.732
but I need to talk to Jason.

01:06:43.002 --> 01:06:47.004
Jason! Jason! Open up.
Should I bust in?

01:06:47.006 --> 01:06:49.173
Honestly, this is not
a good idea.

01:06:49.175 --> 01:06:50.908
Let's just leave them alone.

01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:52.411
No way, man! This is a matter
of life or death.

01:06:52.413 --> 01:06:54.011
We gotta get in.

01:06:54.013 --> 01:06:56.914
You know what?
I gotta run downstairs.

01:06:56.916 --> 01:06:58.916
- Are you bailing on me?
- Hell yes...

01:06:58.918 --> 01:07:00.385
this is too damn much.

01:07:00.387 --> 01:07:03.955
Fucking piece of shit. Okay,
give me the camera.

01:07:03.957 --> 01:07:05.792
Jason, bro, I'm sorry.

01:07:21.475 --> 01:07:24.309
Okay, I literally haven't
been on a slide like this.

01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:25.810
Okay, okay, I haven't either...

01:07:25.812 --> 01:07:27.479
Okay, here, let me go first.

01:07:27.481 --> 01:07:30.249
Yeah, it's like kinda...
is it safe?

01:07:30.251 --> 01:07:32.850
Jason! Hey. Um, where are you,
man?

01:07:32.852 --> 01:07:35.354
Listen dude, we fucked up,
alright?

01:07:35.356 --> 01:07:37.088
Dude, I'm not being paranoid.

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:39.324
I am totally sober, but I think
this cup we found, dude...

01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:42.427
I don't think it's a cup, man.
I think it's a fucking cage.

01:07:42.429 --> 01:07:45.062
It held something inside that's
out now and these things dude...

01:07:45.064 --> 01:07:46.931
they usually need something
to survive.

01:07:46.933 --> 01:07:50.201
Dude, I don't know what to do,
man, I'm bugging out.

01:07:53.973 --> 01:07:56.210
Call me back. This is not
a joke.

01:08:02.449 --> 01:08:04.385
Who's there?

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.085
You trying to prank me?

01:08:08.087 --> 01:08:11.525
Fuck, dude! Drew! You fucking
dickhead, man! You scared me!

01:08:14.994 --> 01:08:19.095
You're very funny, take it off.

01:08:19.098 --> 01:08:23.134
Do something useful!
Help me find your brother!

01:08:23.136 --> 01:08:24.868
What the fuck?!

01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:28.340
Open the door! Help! Somebody,
can you let me out?!

01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:35.011
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Help!

01:08:35.014 --> 01:08:40.951
Help! Hey! Somebody! Shit! Ah!

01:08:47.328 --> 01:08:48.861
Agh!

01:08:52.566 --> 01:08:55.234
Sucks, it's the worst.

01:09:15.356 --> 01:09:18.523
Damn, who's the slut now, Liza?

01:09:18.524 --> 01:09:20.126
This is fucking gold.

01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:31.569
Ha-ha, are you okay?

01:09:31.572 --> 01:09:38.477
Sorry, I never really smoke
this.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:41.178
So what is this thing that you
have to do tomorrow morning?

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:43.981
Oh my God, I totally forgot
about that.

01:09:43.983 --> 01:09:47.184
Uh, it's a cancer walk thing.

01:09:47.185 --> 01:09:48.319
Shit.

01:09:48.322 --> 01:09:51.020
A lot of people donated too.

01:09:51.023 --> 01:09:52.691
Oh man. I'm... I mean, do you
need to go?

01:09:52.693 --> 01:09:54.428
I should, right?

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:59.431
No, I uh... I wanna stay.

01:09:59.433 --> 01:10:03.069
I mean, it's just...
it's just an easy 5k, right?

01:10:06.005 --> 01:10:08.306
We should've done more
charity stuff, for real.

01:10:08.308 --> 01:10:11.075
Like we're so lame like that,
it's crazy.

01:10:11.077 --> 01:10:14.145
Oh no, we are pretty lame, too,
trust me.

01:10:14.147 --> 01:10:16.080
This thing that I'm doing
tomorrow...

01:10:16.082 --> 01:10:19.418
I'm doing it for my mom's, uh...
my mom's memorial fund.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:22.354
Wow, I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't know.

01:10:22.356 --> 01:10:28.226
No, I mean it's fine, I was
eleven, it was a long time ago.

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:33.197
Um, she was actually in complete
remission and uh...

01:10:33.199 --> 01:10:35.333
she was starting to feel like
herself again...

01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:38.570
and she had her energy back and
she was eating again...

01:10:38.572 --> 01:10:42.574
and then um, this one afternoon
she wanted to surprise me...

01:10:42.576 --> 01:10:47.579
and uh, she picked me up from my
field hockey practice.

01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:50.315
She wanted to take me to dinner.

01:10:50.317 --> 01:10:54.719
And um, you know,
everything was... was fine.

01:10:54.721 --> 01:11:00.258
We were we were laughing and
then out of nowhere...

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:04.964
she fainted at the wheel and um,
we skidded off the road...

01:11:09.068 --> 01:11:12.571
and um, I woke up seven days
later...

01:11:12.573 --> 01:11:14.372
with the doctor's telling me
that I was miracle.

01:11:14.374 --> 01:11:17.009
They didn't think that
I was gonna make it back.

01:11:21.348 --> 01:11:26.518
Man, I-I'm really sorry, Claire.
No, I'm sorry.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.321
I uh... I always end up doing
this.

01:11:29.323 --> 01:11:31.756
I've been trying really hard not
to be a buzz kill...

01:11:31.758 --> 01:11:33.492
all night and this always
happens so...

01:11:33.494 --> 01:11:35.494
No, no, you're not being
a buzzkill.

01:11:35.496 --> 01:11:38.530
Thank you for sharing
that with me.

01:11:38.532 --> 01:11:40.365
It's... it's horrible,
I'm so sorry.

01:11:40.367 --> 01:11:44.101
Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.

01:11:44.103 --> 01:11:49.343
But I've been letting it dictate
my life for too long so...

01:11:51.245 --> 01:11:54.346
Look at that fucking asshole!

01:11:54.348 --> 01:11:56.080
Dougie don't even fuck it up!

01:11:56.082 --> 01:11:58.082
Oh my god, I think
they're gonna fucking kiss.

01:11:58.084 --> 01:12:00.418
No, fucking Jason?

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.521
Nah, he like to
take things slow.

01:12:02.523 --> 01:12:04.656
I think holding hands might
be appropriate for tonight.

01:12:04.658 --> 01:12:07.093
I don't know, I think
it might happen.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.468
Oh! Fuck, I told you.

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:21.339
You know, all he had to do was
just brush her hair away...

01:12:21.341 --> 01:12:25.379
gently touch her cheek, and kiss
her soft lips.

01:12:40.794 --> 01:12:42.629
Okay.

01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:56.508
Liza, you fucking stupid bitch.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:13:00.280
I'm gonna fuck your boyfriend
and film it. I win!

01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:09.489
Um, hello? Grant? Are you
hiding?

01:13:11.157 --> 01:13:12.257
Grant!

01:13:12.259 --> 01:13:14.225
Agh!
Oh!

01:13:14.227 --> 01:13:15.862
Gotcha.

01:13:18.632 --> 01:13:20.599
Are you are you
filming this right now?

01:13:20.601 --> 01:13:24.269
Uh-huh, we're making a sex tape.

01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:26.705
Well that is definitely not
something...

01:13:26.707 --> 01:13:30.241
that I am comfortable
with at all.

01:13:30.243 --> 01:13:35.513
Oh, come on. We can watch it
after we fuck.

01:13:35.515 --> 01:13:37.551
Then we can fuck again.

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:47.225
Fuck, you have matured.

01:13:47.227 --> 01:13:50.962
I've matured? You've matured.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.532
Ssh.

01:13:54.534 --> 01:13:56.801
Is that your fucking girlfriend?

01:13:56.803 --> 01:13:58.872
I fuckin' hope so.

01:14:05.779 --> 01:14:07.881
I don't hear anybody.

01:14:09.516 --> 01:14:14.586
What the fuck?

01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:17.422
Hey, whoever the fuck that
is, that's a private bathroom.

01:14:17.424 --> 01:14:19.324
You gotta get out.

01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:22.661
Seriously, get the
fuck out of there.

01:14:22.663 --> 01:14:25.430
Grant, what's happening?

01:14:25.432 --> 01:14:26.933
Grant?

01:14:33.273 --> 01:14:35.208
Asshole.

01:14:43.016 --> 01:14:44.716
Where was this guy hiding?

01:14:44.718 --> 01:14:47.552
Mostly from Liza, but he has
been working out...

01:14:47.554 --> 01:14:50.822
lifting weights, a little, light
cardio just for you.

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:54.461
Aw fuck, you feel so good.

01:15:00.734 --> 01:15:03.902
You like this?
Yeah.

01:15:03.904 --> 01:15:09.543
You like me?
Yeah, I love you. I love you.

01:15:13.447 --> 01:15:20.454
Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't
stop. Don't stop, I'm so close.

01:15:22.823 --> 01:15:25.692
Kate? Kate. Kate?

01:15:28.795 --> 01:15:32.666
What the fuck? Fuck.

01:15:34.334 --> 01:15:35.869
Oh, God.

01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.371
No!

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:45.710
Well, that's good.

01:15:45.712 --> 01:15:48.379
Wait, this is... this is Grant's
room.

01:15:48.381 --> 01:15:50.048
Oh my God.
Listen.

01:15:53.453 --> 01:15:56.389
Ew, I think I can hear Kate.
No, no, that's gotta be Liza.

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:05.999
Oh Liza, Liza.

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:08.933
Let's leave 'em alone.

01:16:08.935 --> 01:16:10.802
That was really loud.
Yeah.

01:16:10.804 --> 01:16:12.873
What's happening in there?

01:16:14.407 --> 01:16:16.007
I wanna marry you.

01:16:16.009 --> 01:16:18.443
Fucking seriously, I will
fucking marry you right now.

01:16:18.445 --> 01:16:20.378
That was insane, your fingers
are amazing.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.781
I'm like outside of myself
right now.

01:16:22.783 --> 01:16:24.883
I'll fuckin' marry you...

01:16:24.885 --> 01:16:27.519
right after I find a bathroom,
I need to pee.

01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:30.922
Hey! Hey! You promise?

01:16:30.924 --> 01:16:34.692
Fuck yeah, I promise.

01:16:34.694 --> 01:16:38.496
Now this is the good stuff,
it's my favorite.

01:16:38.498 --> 01:16:39.931
Thank you.

01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:42.567
Wow, you guys are
finally fucking hanging out.

01:16:42.569 --> 01:16:43.935
Only took four years, right?

01:16:43.937 --> 01:16:46.137
Yeah, it's been a pretty
good night.

01:16:46.139 --> 01:16:48.006
And what about you?

01:16:48.008 --> 01:16:49.641
It sounds like you've been
having a <i>great</i> night.

01:16:49.643 --> 01:16:52.477
No, it's been fuckin' terrible,
okay?

01:16:52.479 --> 01:16:54.112
Grant and I got into
some stupid fight.

01:16:54.114 --> 01:16:56.848
Oh, I thought you guys
were upstairs?

01:16:56.850 --> 01:16:58.383
Yeah, we...

01:16:58.385 --> 01:17:00.518
Upstairs?
We heard you guys in his room.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.888
Well, it couldn't have been me.
I've been down here all night.

01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:05.623
Oh, no, no, no. You know what?
I saw him.

01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:09.527
Actually, he was out front, uh,
with Dougie... with Dougie.

01:17:09.529 --> 01:17:12.964
Grant went upstairs
with that KZB girl.

01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:15.502
Yeah, they went up to his room.

01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:33.585
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, this
area is off limits, back off!

01:17:33.587 --> 01:17:35.987
Get the fuck out of my way!

01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:38.890
You wanna fuck with me,
you piece of shit?

01:17:38.892 --> 01:17:41.626
You will not work a day
on Wall Street.

01:17:41.628 --> 01:17:44.963
My daddy will end you,
you little bitch. Guess what?

01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:47.799
I'm gonna send this fucking
video to every fucking bank...

01:17:47.801 --> 01:17:51.669
in the entire fucking world.

01:17:51.671 --> 01:17:56.441
Oh, open the door! I know you're
in there with that stupid whore!

01:17:56.443 --> 01:18:00.013
Guess what? I made my own key,
bitch.

01:18:02.749 --> 01:18:07.886
Oh, you stupid slut. Come here!
Wake the fuck up!

01:18:07.888 --> 01:18:11.489
Oh my...!

01:18:11.491 --> 01:18:15.862
Somebody help me!
Ah! Oh my God! Grant! No!

01:18:24.037 --> 01:18:25.772
Fuck.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:28.775
Fuck.

01:18:54.834 --> 01:18:57.570
Agh! What the fuck?

01:19:05.545 --> 01:19:07.447
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:19:12.018 --> 01:19:13.785
Time to go.

01:19:13.787 --> 01:19:15.254
Maggie, Maggie, come on.

01:19:15.256 --> 01:19:17.757
No, I'm staying.

01:19:19.059 --> 01:19:22.593
No, no, no, okay.

01:19:22.595 --> 01:19:25.029
Wait, what? You're not supposed
to be better than me.

01:19:25.031 --> 01:19:27.565
Ha-ha, yeah.
Okay, wait a minute.

01:19:27.567 --> 01:19:29.234
I played a lot with my dad
when I was a kid, so...

01:19:29.236 --> 01:19:31.636
You're cheating.
No.

01:19:31.638 --> 01:19:33.671
Yeah, okay, well I need some
help.

01:19:33.673 --> 01:19:35.540
What's this magic that you have?
Okay, are you ready?

01:19:35.542 --> 01:19:36.841
Sorcery. Yeah.

01:19:36.843 --> 01:19:39.777
You cannot just spin it
like a mad man, okay?

01:19:39.779 --> 01:19:43.881
You have to just lightly flick
it in. It's all in the wrist.

01:19:43.883 --> 01:19:45.183
Wait, wait, show me again.

01:19:45.185 --> 01:19:48.686
Okay, you just lightly
touch it in, like that.

01:19:48.688 --> 01:19:52.092
Like?
Mm-hm.

01:20:14.647 --> 01:20:16.781
Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you
alright?

01:20:16.783 --> 01:20:19.684
Hey, man, someone call
911.

01:20:19.686 --> 01:20:21.019
Yo, buddy, you... you alright?

01:20:21.021 --> 01:20:23.187
We need a fucking doctor!
Hey. Hey.

01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:24.889
Oh shit!

01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:34.701
Out of the way!

01:20:39.139 --> 01:20:42.142
Get the fuck out of here!
Everybody run!

01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:05.330
What?

01:21:05.332 --> 01:21:06.898
Just one second, okay?

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.800
I just have to I have to turn
something off.

01:21:08.802 --> 01:21:10.335
What? You have a camera?

01:21:10.337 --> 01:21:15.374
Yeah, we like, we prank each
other and do al... what the fuck?

01:21:15.376 --> 01:21:17.642
Is this...? Where's the...?

01:21:17.644 --> 01:21:20.345
Oh, hello.

01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:22.980
Whoa, okay, it's recording.

01:21:22.982 --> 01:21:24.949
Wait, what's that?

01:21:24.951 --> 01:21:27.151
Wait, what the fuck?!
Hold this for a sec?

01:21:27.153 --> 01:21:29.821
Drew! Come on, man! Get the fuck
outta here!

01:21:29.823 --> 01:21:32.190
Jesus Christ!
What's wrong with his eyes?

01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:35.026
Wait, what the fuck?

01:21:35.028 --> 01:21:37.795
Where's Dougie?! Something has
happened downstairs.

01:21:37.797 --> 01:21:39.831
We have to go! We have to go!

01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:41.165
What?
What the fuck is happening?

01:21:41.167 --> 01:21:42.602
You guys, look.

01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:49.441
Oh, dammit. Dougie. Yo.
Oh my God.

01:21:49.443 --> 01:21:51.878
Dougie. Dougie.
Oh my...

01:21:54.415 --> 01:21:55.713
Okay, he's breathing! He's
breathing!

01:21:55.715 --> 01:21:56.981
Dougie! Dude, come on!

01:21:58.452 --> 01:22:01.286
Dougie! Fuck! Wake up!
Wiggles, what is going on?

01:22:01.288 --> 01:22:04.956
Dougie was right! It killed the
family that used to live here...

01:22:04.958 --> 01:22:07.925
and now it's getting stronger,
it's feeding on us!

01:22:07.927 --> 01:22:11.796
We need to leave!
We need to leave now!

01:22:28.047 --> 01:22:30.915
No, please let me out!
No!

01:22:54.974 --> 01:22:56.443
Ssh!

01:22:58.479 --> 01:23:02.079
No... Tate.

01:23:02.081 --> 01:23:04.916
Tate. Tate!

01:23:04.918 --> 01:23:06.753
Tate!

01:23:09.122 --> 01:23:11.523
Ali, no. Ali!

01:23:31.844 --> 01:23:34.845
Guys, come on, we can't just
leave him here.

01:23:34.847 --> 01:23:36.814
We can't carry him.

01:23:36.816 --> 01:23:40.019
Wiggles is right. He'll be safer
here. We have to go for help.

01:23:42.021 --> 01:23:44.891
Okay. Okay.

01:24:00.073 --> 01:24:05.009
Okay, the quickest way out is
through the living room, okay?

01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:07.212
Yo, will you put that shit down,
you fuck?

01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:09.214
No, nobody will ever believe us.

01:24:09.216 --> 01:24:12.085
We have to show what's
happening here!

01:24:19.025 --> 01:24:22.227
Okay, we gotta go out this
way.

01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:24.363
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Can we get down here?

01:24:24.365 --> 01:24:25.965
No, no, no, no, it's too high.
It's too high. It's too high.

01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:29.002
Okay.

01:24:31.472 --> 01:24:32.839
Quietly.

01:24:44.150 --> 01:24:46.185
Okay.

01:24:49.256 --> 01:24:53.294
Fuck. Fuck. Goddammit. Okay.

01:24:55.596 --> 01:24:59.431
We're gonna have to go to
the... to the living room.

01:24:59.433 --> 01:25:01.600
Oh my God! Oh my...!

01:25:01.602 --> 01:25:03.102
Come on, come on.

01:25:40.574 --> 01:25:43.542
Tanner! Tanner! You can still
get out!

01:26:19.979 --> 01:26:22.516
What the fuck is that?
Is he dead?

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.322
Wait, hold on.
Okay.

01:26:33.727 --> 01:26:36.095
Hurry up, gimme that!

01:26:37.531 --> 01:26:40.965
Okay... okay, okay.

01:26:40.967 --> 01:26:43.370
This way, this way. Come on,
come on.

01:26:52.212 --> 01:26:54.581
Okay. Okay.

01:27:06.226 --> 01:27:08.995
Tanner. T?

01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:22.309
Maggie? Oh my God.

01:27:27.481 --> 01:27:29.316
Wait.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

01:27:43.464 --> 01:27:45.965
It won't open. We're trapped.
What?

01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:52.237
Greg, dude, man, get up,
we gotta go.

01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:53.738
Where, Wiggles?
Aw man, get the fuck up.

01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.174
What are you doing?!

01:27:59.279 --> 01:28:00.745
Stop! Stop!

01:28:00.747 --> 01:28:03.317
There's a safe room. Come on,
let's go.

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.662
We need to turn the lights on.
Okay.

01:28:21.735 --> 01:28:23.568
What do we do? What... what do we
do?

01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:25.537
The light switch, on the wall.

01:28:25.539 --> 01:28:27.372
Okay.

01:28:27.374 --> 01:28:29.508
Where? Where? Where?

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:30.842
We have to hurry, Claire!

01:28:30.844 --> 01:28:33.447
Okay, okay, okay.

01:28:35.682 --> 01:28:38.148
Claire! We have to find
it, Claire!

01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:40.318
Oh my God.

01:28:50.831 --> 01:28:52.533
Oh, my god.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.808
How do we... how do we get
it in there?

01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:40.447
I don't know. I don't know.

01:29:42.516 --> 01:29:46.320
Maybe there's something in
here that that tells us.

01:30:00.233 --> 01:30:01.702
Let's see.

01:30:08.275 --> 01:30:10.711
The police will be here soon.

01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:31.898
Hello?

01:30:34.401 --> 01:30:36.436
Hello! We're down here!

01:30:42.876 --> 01:30:44.843
Jason?

01:30:44.845 --> 01:30:47.979
Daphne, what are you doing here?
Are you okay?

01:30:47.981 --> 01:30:50.615
Are the police up there?
What's going on?

01:30:50.617 --> 01:30:52.517
Are you okay?

01:30:52.519 --> 01:30:54.386
Is it safe? What's happening?
Is it safe?

01:30:54.388 --> 01:30:56.821
What's happening? Daphne!

01:30:56.823 --> 01:30:58.923
Daphne, what's going on?
Is it safe?

01:30:58.925 --> 01:31:00.725
Hello?!

01:31:00.727 --> 01:31:03.561
My mom always thought the evil
was still in the house...

01:31:03.563 --> 01:31:05.664
after my grandparents died.

01:31:05.666 --> 01:31:08.833
And I promised to never
let it get out again.

01:31:08.835 --> 01:31:11.336
Wait, what are you talking
about, Daphne?!

01:31:11.338 --> 01:31:14.305
Your grandparents?
I'm sorry, Jason.

01:31:14.307 --> 01:31:15.807
Agh!

01:31:15.809 --> 01:31:17.642
Oh my God! Oh my God! Jason!

01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:20.345
- I'm sorry, I had to.
- What did you do?

01:31:20.347 --> 01:31:22.280
What did you do to him?

01:31:22.282 --> 01:31:25.617
It's you or Jason, he saved you
for last.

01:31:25.619 --> 01:31:27.018
Oh my God.

01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:36.294
It must be you. Did you survive
a death?

01:31:36.296 --> 01:31:37.595
What? No.

01:31:37.597 --> 01:31:39.397
Did you survive a death?!
What are you saying?

01:31:39.399 --> 01:31:41.399
I have to kill you. It's the
only way to stop it.

01:31:41.401 --> 01:31:42.834
No!
You have to die!

01:31:42.836 --> 01:31:44.636
Please! I didn't do
anything!

01:31:44.638 --> 01:31:46.504
My grandfather had to
kill his wife to stop it!

01:31:46.506 --> 01:31:48.306
Stop this please,
please!

01:31:48.308 --> 01:31:50.308
It needs you to fully
free itself from the cage.

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:51.876
Please! No!

01:31:51.878 --> 01:31:55.513
- Just turn around!
- No! Please!

01:31:55.515 --> 01:31:57.784
- Close your eyes, Claire, please!
- You're crazy!

01:32:01.722 --> 01:32:06.226
Let go! Claire! Don't...
Run... run.

01:32:10.464 --> 01:32:11.930
Claire!

01:32:11.932 --> 01:32:16.501
It's gonna cross over
and we're all gonna die.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.908
Dougie! Dougie!

01:32:26.046 --> 01:32:27.681
I'm sorry, Claire.

01:32:33.887 --> 01:32:36.654
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I-I couldn't let it out.

01:32:36.656 --> 01:32:40.658
Claire, I heard everything.
I'm sorry.

01:32:48.735 --> 01:32:50.804
I'm sorry.

01:33:01.114 --> 01:33:03.483
