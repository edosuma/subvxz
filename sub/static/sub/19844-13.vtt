WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.430
- <i>Previously on</i> The Originals...
- We were in love for two centuries.

00:02.432 --> 00:04.723
- What the hell happened?
- I asked you to leave with me!

00:04.726 --> 00:06.955
But you didn't love me as
much as you love New Orleans.

00:06.957 --> 00:08.122
I saw things, Rebekah,

00:08.125 --> 00:10.592
<i>in his mind. Not just memories.</i>

00:10.594 --> 00:12.328
<i>I saw his natural instincts, and...</i>

00:12.330 --> 00:14.329
I think maybe that's who he really is.

00:14.331 --> 00:15.897
VINCENT: The Hollow is
stronger than we are.

00:15.899 --> 00:16.898
It's got more followers,

00:16.900 --> 00:18.499
<i>and it's gonna destroy New Orleans.</i>

00:18.501 --> 00:20.040
LEAD ACOLYTE:
The Hollow has shed her flesh

00:20.042 --> 00:21.436
to take on that of another.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.670
We'll kill that body as well.

00:22.672 --> 00:23.738
Oh, you won't dare.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.006
<i>Even now, she's locking herself</i>

00:25.008 --> 00:26.141
<i>within the greatest witch</i>

00:26.143 --> 00:27.467
<i>this world may ever know.</i>

00:27.470 --> 00:29.444
Hope's gone. She's the Hollow now.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.312
I have to find her.

00:31.314 --> 00:33.065
Vincent, surely you
can pull the Hollow out.

00:33.068 --> 00:35.316
- I think I know a way to save her.
- Anything.

00:35.318 --> 00:37.637
If we go this route, this is
gonna be the end of your family.

00:37.639 --> 00:40.254
This is gonna be the end
of always and forever.

00:41.358 --> 00:43.391
VINCENT: The Hollow has
been haunting New Orleans

00:43.393 --> 00:44.759
for centuries.

00:44.761 --> 00:47.194
It's an unending evil.

00:47.196 --> 00:49.979
Its appetite for power is insatiable.

00:49.982 --> 00:52.665
And that's what attracted
it to your little girl.

00:52.668 --> 00:54.281
You said there was a way to save her.

00:54.284 --> 00:55.222
VINCENT: There is.

00:55.225 --> 00:56.719
But I'm gonna tell you right now,

00:56.722 --> 00:58.522
you are not gonna like my plan.

00:59.575 --> 01:01.842
Step one:

01:01.844 --> 01:03.977
we pull the Hollow out of Hope.

01:03.979 --> 01:07.614
Step two: we find
someplace else to put it.

01:07.616 --> 01:09.716
But with the book gone, I need a place

01:09.718 --> 01:11.951
that's both powerful and eternal.

01:11.953 --> 01:13.987
And in order to make the
transition work, I'm gonna need

01:13.989 --> 01:15.995
something that's connected
to Hope through blood.

01:15.998 --> 01:17.824
You need a vampire.

01:18.894 --> 01:21.227
You want to put the Hollow
into one of my siblings.

01:21.229 --> 01:23.696
Uh, one ain't gonna cut it.

01:26.134 --> 01:28.101
I'm gonna need four of them.

01:29.837 --> 01:31.058
Why four of us?

01:31.061 --> 01:33.306
Well, 1,500 years ago, when
the Hollow was first killed,

01:33.308 --> 01:34.774
they divided her remains.

01:34.776 --> 01:36.342
Four bones, four volunteers,

01:36.344 --> 01:37.576
four different locations.

01:37.578 --> 01:39.879
That's how we're going
to beat the Hollow now.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.508
Transfer the Hollow's power
into four immortal vampires.

01:43.511 --> 01:45.284
And just send us on our way.

01:45.286 --> 01:46.459
So the evil is drawn,

01:46.462 --> 01:48.754
quartered and separated for all time.

01:48.756 --> 01:50.489
And you have to go your separate ways,

01:50.491 --> 01:51.857
and you have to stay separate.

01:51.859 --> 01:53.625
For all time.

01:53.627 --> 01:55.394
We can never see each other again.

01:56.230 --> 01:57.896
Can never go near each other again.

02:02.102 --> 02:04.669
That is the only way that
we're gonna beat the Hollow.

02:06.974 --> 02:10.908
Well, if it'll save my little
girl, then we will make it so.

DOMINIC: All of you, know that this

03:10.958 --> 03:13.503
is the power of the Hollow.

03:13.505 --> 03:16.005
The power to transcend death,

03:16.007 --> 03:19.041
and destroy all who stand against us.

03:31.222 --> 03:32.954
[grunts softly]

03:35.559 --> 03:38.327
Vincent needs our blood.

03:38.329 --> 03:41.497
Right. All four of us,
and Kol isn't answering

03:41.499 --> 03:42.764
his bloody phone.

03:42.766 --> 03:44.233
He's finally got a chance at happiness,

03:44.235 --> 03:45.767
and we're asking him to
come home and play host

03:45.769 --> 03:46.792
to a quarter of a demon.

03:46.795 --> 03:47.800
There has to be another way.

03:47.802 --> 03:49.432
What if there isn't another way?

03:49.435 --> 03:51.105
I can't believe this is happening.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.641
I'm usually the first one who wants to

03:52.643 --> 03:53.842
run off on my own, and-and now

03:53.844 --> 03:55.143
I don't have a say in the matter.

03:55.145 --> 03:56.277
- I'm feeling quite perturbed.
- Hope.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.412
Hope is all that matters.

03:57.414 --> 03:58.580
This is not happening.

03:58.582 --> 04:01.219
I will not let this
family be split apart.

04:01.222 --> 04:03.484
I'm going to the bell tower
and I'm going to go through

04:03.486 --> 04:05.586
more of mother's grimoires.

04:05.588 --> 04:07.289
Freya.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.460
Elijah, you know how
it feels to be apart.

04:12.462 --> 04:14.929
At first, the freedom is exhilarating,

04:14.931 --> 04:16.363
and then, one day, inevitably,

04:16.366 --> 04:18.065
you wake up with that
pit in your stomach,

04:18.067 --> 04:19.867
that dull, aching feeling

04:19.869 --> 04:22.135
of missing the only people who know you.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.539
Until that very ache threatens
to consume you entirely.

04:25.541 --> 04:28.175
For a thousand years, we
have been honoring a vow

04:28.177 --> 04:29.610
to stand together.

04:32.281 --> 04:34.949
Being forced to separate
feels like torture.

04:41.790 --> 04:44.081
JOSH: I just texted
all of you her photo.

04:44.084 --> 04:47.094
Now, Marcel literally
said "scour the city.”

04:47.096 --> 04:50.597
That means everyone is
searching everywhere.

04:50.599 --> 04:52.499
Witches, check the Cauldron.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.701
Vampires, search the Quarter.

04:54.703 --> 04:56.168
[woman gasps]

04:56.170 --> 04:58.738
Hello, Joshua.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.107
No way.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.010
Good-bye, Joshua.

05:06.214 --> 05:08.481
[vampires moaning]

05:11.652 --> 05:14.286
Degenerate vampire filth.

05:14.288 --> 05:17.623
Now, why would noble witches stoop

05:17.625 --> 05:19.725
to associate with these...

05:19.727 --> 05:22.261
parasites?

05:22.263 --> 05:25.297
Now, if you wish to embrace true power,

05:25.299 --> 05:27.366
and rid your city of vermin,

05:27.368 --> 05:30.040
declare your allegiance to the Hollow.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.808
[line ringing]

05:36.810 --> 05:39.511
- [phone beeps]
- Still no word from Kol.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.412
And if he doesn't bother to show,

05:41.414 --> 05:43.281
that just leaves Haley.

05:43.283 --> 05:45.772
She is Hope's only
other immortal relative.

05:47.663 --> 05:49.910
That means you would have to
part ways with her as well.

05:49.913 --> 05:51.789
ELIJAH: No. Kol will come.

05:51.791 --> 05:53.525
And Niklaus will be with his child.

05:53.527 --> 05:57.328
The three of them must remain together.

05:57.330 --> 06:00.064
Oh, and you would just walk away
from the woman that you love?

06:01.600 --> 06:02.767
And what about Nik?

06:02.769 --> 06:04.401
On his own, no family.

06:04.403 --> 06:07.304
You know very well that without
you around, he will go mad.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.754
DOMINIC: Witches of the Cauldron.

06:24.756 --> 06:29.593
I ask you to join your
one and true savior.

06:31.213 --> 06:35.999
Pledge your loyalty, and she
will free you from oppression.

06:36.001 --> 06:40.136
MAN: Watch that girl. She kills witches.

06:45.911 --> 06:47.944
[crowd yelling, screaming]

[screaming continues]

HAYLEY: Hey!

06:58.223 --> 06:59.689
Hope!

06:59.691 --> 07:01.090
[panting]

07:01.092 --> 07:05.127
Baby, I know you can hear me.

07:06.864 --> 07:09.098
I need you to fight her.

07:09.934 --> 07:11.800
You think you can stop me?

07:11.803 --> 07:13.536
I'm not gonna let you take her.

07:14.638 --> 07:16.538
[gasps]

07:18.342 --> 07:19.775
[gasps]

[Hayley moans]

07:43.143 --> 07:45.911
Ah.

07:45.913 --> 07:48.314
You're okay.

07:48.316 --> 07:49.801
You're all right.

07:49.804 --> 07:51.584
Some witches, um, they found you

07:51.586 --> 07:53.585
on the street, they called
me and I brought you here.

07:53.587 --> 07:55.918
I have to go back. I have to
get that thing out of Hope.

07:55.921 --> 07:58.056
That's what I'm trying to do, Hayley.

07:58.058 --> 08:01.827
I'm shoring up my power for the ritual.

08:03.097 --> 08:04.662
What ritual?

08:04.664 --> 08:08.100
The ritual that we need to talk about.

08:12.872 --> 08:15.906
We should go before whoever
did this decides to come back.

08:15.908 --> 08:19.244
[Josh coughing]

08:19.246 --> 08:20.841
MARCEL: Easy.

08:20.844 --> 08:23.077
Easy. [Josh groans]

08:23.080 --> 08:25.347
MARCEL: Hey. You got hit pretty hard.

08:26.626 --> 08:27.792
Tell me what happened.

08:27.795 --> 08:29.255
Well, it's, uh...

08:29.257 --> 08:31.157
pretty straightforward, really.

08:31.159 --> 08:33.994
Creepy resurrected witch
made me his personal piñata.

08:33.996 --> 08:36.284
What creepy resurrected witch?

08:36.287 --> 08:39.332
Oh, that would be your
old buddy, Dominic.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.701
MARCEL: Wait, how the hell

08:40.703 --> 08:42.168
- is he alive?
- SOFYA: Does anything

08:42.169 --> 08:44.136
surprise you at this
point? I mean, look around.

08:44.139 --> 08:45.896
We're standing in the
middle of a war zone.

08:45.899 --> 08:49.609
The Hollow almost destroyed
me. Now it's raising the dead?

08:49.611 --> 08:51.011
I say we either

08:51.013 --> 08:52.412
get out of here while we can,

08:52.414 --> 08:54.547
or we offer the Hollow a deal.

08:54.549 --> 08:57.183
JOSH: Uh, sorry to interrupt here.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.552
Wouldn't it be smart
to, like, align ourselves

08:59.554 --> 09:01.554
with the crazy powerful,
unbeatable family

09:01.556 --> 09:03.890
who also wants to kill this thing?

09:06.193 --> 09:10.329
So, all four of them have
to go their separate ways?

09:10.331 --> 09:12.579
Forever.

09:12.582 --> 09:14.699
Yeah, and I didn't tell them this.

09:14.701 --> 09:16.201
When you leave here,

09:16.203 --> 09:18.003
you need to go home, you
need to pack some bags,

09:18.005 --> 09:20.139
you need to find a way out
of town, quick and quiet,

09:20.141 --> 09:21.407
just for you and Hope.

09:21.409 --> 09:22.829
What are you talking about?

09:22.832 --> 09:25.411
Hayley, the Hollow has felt
your little girl's power.

09:25.413 --> 09:28.514
And it's gonna want
to get that power back.

09:29.607 --> 09:32.050
And when we finish
this ritual, the Hollow

09:32.052 --> 09:33.985
is gonna live inside of the Mikaelsons.

09:35.121 --> 09:37.154
Through them, it's gonna reach out,

09:37.157 --> 09:39.791
and it's gonna try to regain
access to your little girl.

09:39.793 --> 09:41.660
That can never happen
and any time they are

09:41.662 --> 09:43.762
anywhere near her, she
is not gonna be safe.

09:43.764 --> 09:45.498
Ever.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.398
Now, you and I both know
that Klaus Mikaelson,

09:47.400 --> 09:49.400
he's not gonna be okay with that.

09:49.402 --> 09:52.173
So when we finish this ritual,

09:52.176 --> 09:55.710
when we get your little girl
back, you have got to go.

09:57.134 --> 09:59.867
Hayley, you take her,
and you run like hell.

10:08.812 --> 10:10.645
[breathing shakily]

10:21.490 --> 10:24.058
KEELIN: This is Keelin, leave a message.

10:24.060 --> 10:26.327
- [line beeps]
- Keelin, hey.

10:26.329 --> 10:29.263
It's me, uh...

10:29.265 --> 10:32.221
I'm just kind of losing
my mind at the moment.

10:32.224 --> 10:34.268
Um...

10:34.270 --> 10:36.103
my family's about to be pulled apart

10:36.105 --> 10:39.205
and there's literally
nothing I can do about it.

10:42.010 --> 10:43.677
I'm supposed to be the big sister

10:43.679 --> 10:45.779
that could fix everything, and I just...

10:48.450 --> 10:50.249
I really need you.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.386
[phone beeps]

11:00.095 --> 11:01.594
<i>[line ringing]</i>

11:01.596 --> 11:03.363
No word for Kol and Hayley.

11:03.365 --> 11:04.998
- Try again.
- What is the bloody point...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.599
Niklaus, try again!

11:06.601 --> 11:08.534
Where have you been?

11:08.536 --> 11:10.402
Doesn't matter.

11:10.404 --> 11:11.871
Vincent told me everything.

11:11.873 --> 11:13.772
Is this really happening?

11:15.409 --> 11:18.443
Assuming our other immortal
brother answers the damn phone.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.679
We still need to go get Hope.

11:20.682 --> 11:22.347
Vincent said the Hollow
is gathering a congregation

11:22.349 --> 11:23.616
at the church.

11:23.618 --> 11:26.382
- Then let's go get her.
- She's possessed, Klaus,

11:26.385 --> 11:28.053
surrounded by followers.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.787
We can't just go running in there.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.589
REBEKAH: Hayley, we have a plan.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.691
It's actually a rather good one.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.093
[shackles jingling]

11:36.830 --> 11:38.530
This collection is priceless.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.790
You sure you want to hand it
all over to the Mikaelsons?

11:40.793 --> 11:42.434
Dark objects belong to the city.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.135
As long as they help
us take down the Hollow,

11:44.137 --> 11:45.537
that's all that matters.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.006
Even if it means trusting
the family who made a weapon

11:48.008 --> 11:50.842
specifically designed to kill you?

11:52.378 --> 11:55.346
Desperate times. We need allies.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.044
Hayley,

12:27.046 --> 12:29.379
I can't undo the things I've...

12:29.381 --> 12:30.747
- Elijah...
- No.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.715
I can't stop

12:32.717 --> 12:34.250
being...

12:34.252 --> 12:35.285
this.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.587
I also can't stop loving you.

12:37.589 --> 12:40.557
So you tell me what you need me to do.

12:42.127 --> 12:44.660
Yes, I'm ashamed and I'm appalled...

12:44.662 --> 12:46.862
I don't need you to apologize, Elijah.

12:46.864 --> 12:48.709
Not right now.

12:48.712 --> 12:52.334
Right now, I need you
to get my daughter back.

12:54.606 --> 12:55.960
Of course.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.194
MARCEL: Quite the party.

13:17.228 --> 13:18.660
[acolytes murmuring]

13:18.662 --> 13:20.562
DOMINIC: Marcel Gerard,

13:20.564 --> 13:22.430
king of New Orleans.

13:25.368 --> 13:27.435
Accompanied by his top advisor.

13:28.672 --> 13:30.204
Well, I trust you've come to grovel

13:30.206 --> 13:32.173
and bow before the power of the Hollow.

13:32.175 --> 13:34.509
Actually, we came to make a truce.

13:34.511 --> 13:37.345
The way I see it, we
both have the same enemy:

13:37.347 --> 13:38.712
the Mikaelsons.

13:38.714 --> 13:41.182
Now, you help me get
them out of this city,

13:41.184 --> 13:43.050
and maybe there's a world in which

13:43.052 --> 13:45.153
we all live happily ever after.

13:45.155 --> 13:49.257
Diplomacy. A wise choice.

13:58.734 --> 14:00.200
[ghostly whispers]

14:12.847 --> 14:16.054
I want the king to kneel before me.

14:24.493 --> 14:25.925
Behold,

14:25.927 --> 14:27.861
covens of New Orleans,

14:27.864 --> 14:30.362
even the great Marcel Gerard

14:30.364 --> 14:33.099
is nothing in the face of the Hollow.

14:33.768 --> 14:35.267
[blows]

14:35.269 --> 14:36.769
[shackles clamp]

14:37.605 --> 14:39.672
[Dominic grunts, acolytes yell]

14:40.505 --> 14:41.974
KLAUS: Hear ye, hear ye,

14:41.976 --> 14:43.776
all disciples and acolytes

14:43.778 --> 14:46.412
of the evil Hollow.

14:46.414 --> 14:48.046
Now that your master has been subdued,

14:48.048 --> 14:50.249
the power she promised
you has been revoked,

14:50.251 --> 14:51.701
rendering you helpless,

14:51.704 --> 14:54.653
and bringing this pitiful
coup to a rather abrupt end.

14:54.655 --> 14:59.124
This dark object has
the astounding ability

14:59.126 --> 15:01.126
to seal you in the room.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.596
[acolytes gasping]

15:05.933 --> 15:07.699
Which is very inconvenient indeed.

15:08.451 --> 15:10.017
Particularly when one considers

15:10.020 --> 15:12.017
the architectural
composition of the structure.

15:12.020 --> 15:14.620
And so, with very little effort...

15:18.578 --> 15:19.977
this place becomes an inferno.

15:19.979 --> 15:21.713
[acolytes murmuring]

15:22.582 --> 15:24.882
[acolytes scream, bottle explodes]

15:39.941 --> 15:42.875
I know you're in there.

15:42.877 --> 15:44.710
And I know you can hear me,

15:44.712 --> 15:48.280
so I want you to listen very carefully.

15:53.587 --> 15:56.797
You are my daughter.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.424
You're a Mikaelson.

15:58.426 --> 16:01.360
And you are strong,

16:01.362 --> 16:03.321
and brave,

16:03.324 --> 16:05.224
unlike anyone I've ever known.

16:07.587 --> 16:10.322
In fact, you helped
me believe in something

16:10.325 --> 16:12.191
your uncle once said.

16:15.496 --> 16:18.297
“Family is power.”

16:36.463 --> 16:38.295
You're a good dad, Klaus.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.898
And you deserve the truth.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.501
There is something that you
need to know about the ritual.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.403
Vincent didn't want to tell
you because he didn't think

16:46.405 --> 16:48.806
that you'd go through with
it, but I know that you will.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.343
I know that you'll do anything for her.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.274
Even if it means never seeing her again.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.292
REBEKAH: Did you honestly
think you could trick us

17:11.295 --> 17:12.494
into performing the ritual

17:12.497 --> 17:14.388
without telling the entire truth?

17:14.392 --> 17:16.298
VINCENT: You and your
family aren't my problem.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.366
The only thing

17:17.367 --> 17:18.768
that I'm concerned about right now

17:18.770 --> 17:20.853
is that little girl and the
monster that's inside of her.

17:20.855 --> 17:23.271
Is it hard to see me from
up there on your high horse?

17:23.273 --> 17:25.073
She is my niece.

17:25.076 --> 17:27.411
Of course we will do whatever
we have to do to protect her,

17:27.414 --> 17:29.414
but you can damn well
be honest about it!

17:29.417 --> 17:31.713
See, your reaction, right there
has just proven my point.

17:31.715 --> 17:34.583
You Mikaelsons are selfish,
egocentric fanatics.

17:34.585 --> 17:35.984
It is not my job, nor is it

17:35.986 --> 17:37.253
my inclination to try to convince you

17:37.255 --> 17:38.424
to do the right thing.

17:38.427 --> 17:40.540
If you really want to save
your niece, then you need to

17:40.542 --> 17:42.724
get out of my ear and let
me do what it is that I do.

17:42.726 --> 17:44.092
- You know what? You...
- FREYA: He's right.

17:44.094 --> 17:46.672
I may not agree with his tactics...

17:46.675 --> 17:48.730
but he's our only chance at saving Hope.

17:48.732 --> 17:50.132
Lucky you, I guess I'll just have to

17:50.134 --> 17:51.299
postpone the disembowelment.

17:51.301 --> 17:52.801
- Rebekah?
- What?

17:52.803 --> 17:54.136
Have you heard from Kol?

17:54.138 --> 17:56.237
Not a word.

17:57.274 --> 17:58.874
I'll try reaching him with magic.

17:58.876 --> 18:00.208
VINCENT: Okay, look, we need

18:00.210 --> 18:02.843
four volunteers that are
connected to Hope through blood.

18:02.845 --> 18:06.013
We have Rebekah, we have Klaus
and Elijah, that makes three.

18:06.015 --> 18:08.319
If you can't get to Kol, then we're
gonna have to use Hayley.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.217
FREYA: No.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.751
No, that is not happening.

18:14.157 --> 18:15.690
Not when there's another way.

18:25.267 --> 18:27.835
[footfalls approaching]

18:27.837 --> 18:29.236
Thank you for coming.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.973
MARCEL: Was something
wrong? Vincent said that...

18:30.975 --> 18:33.006
Vincent said a lot of things.

18:33.008 --> 18:35.775
And he failed to say a few things more,

18:35.777 --> 18:38.478
one of which has me rather vexed.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.748
Oh, okay, I see. So
you need another favor.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.685
No. No more favors.

18:44.687 --> 18:47.721
Unless, of course, you count the
burden of hearing my confession.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.161
I was never a good father to you.

18:55.163 --> 18:58.664
No surprises, I never had
much in the way of an example.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.499
[clears throat]

19:00.501 --> 19:03.502
I never saw myself in
the man who raised me.

19:03.504 --> 19:05.671
In fact, the first time
I saw myself in another

19:05.673 --> 19:07.273
was the day I met you.

19:08.610 --> 19:12.545
Throwing apples at the
oppressor who whipped you raw.

19:14.915 --> 19:17.950
I should've known you'd grow
up to be a better man than I.

19:20.121 --> 19:22.221
You do realize we're about, um,

19:22.223 --> 19:24.123
100 years too late for this talk.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.358
Well, I'm hardly perfect.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.294
Unless we forget the five
years I spent in your dungeon,

19:29.296 --> 19:31.230
- neither are you.
- Yeah, well, you see,

19:31.232 --> 19:33.165
I'm not really too
moved by your opinion.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.134
If I was, I'd have to face the fact that

19:35.136 --> 19:36.701
I'm not good enough for your family,

19:36.703 --> 19:39.337
that I'm not good enough
for Rebekah, that I'm not...

19:39.339 --> 19:40.605
You are family.

19:40.607 --> 19:42.407
And as for my sister,

19:42.409 --> 19:43.975
her love for you was a threat.

19:45.746 --> 19:48.713
How could either of you love each other

19:48.715 --> 19:50.515
and still have room for me?

19:52.519 --> 19:54.218
In any case,

19:54.220 --> 19:57.554
I just wanted to see you one last time

19:57.556 --> 19:59.056
before we part ways for good,

19:59.058 --> 20:01.458
if only to set the record straight.

20:05.631 --> 20:07.631
I failed you...

20:08.768 --> 20:10.334
Marcellus.

20:14.674 --> 20:17.040
To my eternal shame.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.796
[sighs]

20:32.324 --> 20:33.824
Hey.

20:34.893 --> 20:37.027
I got your messages.

20:39.164 --> 20:41.298
Are you okay?

20:42.968 --> 20:44.767
We need to talk.

20:44.769 --> 20:48.705
And... you're not going to like it.

20:50.007 --> 20:52.375
Okay.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.943
I just...

20:53.945 --> 20:58.614
Say the first thing
that comes to mind and...

20:58.616 --> 21:00.916
then the next and we'll
keep going from there.

21:08.959 --> 21:12.526
I grew up without a mother,

21:12.528 --> 21:15.296
without anybody who loved me.

21:15.298 --> 21:20.300
And I can't just sit back and
watch Hope be taken from Hayley.

21:20.302 --> 21:23.337
If Kol doesn't show up,

21:23.339 --> 21:25.973
I have to make things right.

21:25.975 --> 21:29.218
They need four vampires...

21:31.080 --> 21:34.181
each related by blood to Hope.

21:36.886 --> 21:40.354
I can be the fourth...

21:40.356 --> 21:42.356
if I turn.

21:42.358 --> 21:45.192
But you would lose everything:

21:45.194 --> 21:46.960
your home, your family,

21:46.962 --> 21:48.561
your ability to practice magic.

21:48.563 --> 21:50.030
And will I lose you?

21:50.032 --> 21:51.265
[sighs]

21:51.267 --> 21:53.679
If I become the kind of monster

21:53.682 --> 21:54.901
that killed your family?

21:54.903 --> 21:56.202
I am not going anywhere.

21:57.773 --> 21:59.211
Julie and Juliet all the way.

21:59.214 --> 22:01.441
[both chuckle]

22:07.749 --> 22:09.882
[Hayley sniffles]

22:09.884 --> 22:12.059
We should talk before it's too late.

22:12.062 --> 22:14.086
You don't have to say anything.

22:18.692 --> 22:20.960
I want you to know that
what happened in the pendant

22:20.962 --> 22:23.862
doesn't take away everything
that we've had between us.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.998
I know it's over.

22:33.441 --> 22:36.575
And what are we, anyway?

22:36.577 --> 22:39.344
What is the Mikaelson family?

22:39.346 --> 22:43.148
Desperately searching
for some kind of humanity

22:43.150 --> 22:46.151
beneath the ridiculous
banner of always and forever.

22:48.588 --> 22:50.989
Whatever we are,

22:50.991 --> 22:53.158
you and me...

22:54.995 --> 22:56.828
we were doomed.

22:56.830 --> 23:01.298
I could never be what
you needed me to be.

23:04.370 --> 23:07.071
Best thing I could do
for you is disappear.

23:08.908 --> 23:10.137
I love you.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.259
I love you, too.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.714
Ugh. Is that disgusting?

23:30.716 --> 23:32.582
You're chugging a glass of blood?

23:32.584 --> 23:33.850
That looks disgusting.

23:33.852 --> 23:35.485
Are you ready for what's next?

23:35.487 --> 23:37.388
Mm-hmm.

23:37.390 --> 23:40.065
Potassium chloride.

23:40.068 --> 23:42.125
It'll stop your heart,

23:42.127 --> 23:44.463
quick and painless.

23:47.633 --> 23:48.832
Okay, this is crazy.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.567
I mean, what if you don't wake up?

23:50.569 --> 23:53.773
I will. Okay? I promise.

24:00.545 --> 24:01.710
[sighs]

24:01.712 --> 24:04.080
I'm ready for this.

24:04.082 --> 24:06.282
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

24:06.284 --> 24:08.251
I come from a long line of vampires.

24:08.253 --> 24:12.322
And, besides, magic's kind of overrated.

24:12.324 --> 24:13.923
KOL: Easy for you to say.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.792
You haven't had to live without it.

24:16.794 --> 24:20.128
[both chuckle]

24:20.130 --> 24:21.764
I didn't think you were coming.

24:21.766 --> 24:25.033
Almost didn't, but given

24:25.035 --> 24:27.102
the number of messages and magic notes

24:27.104 --> 24:28.737
appearing in my pocket,

24:28.739 --> 24:30.439
I figured there might be an emergency.

24:36.813 --> 24:38.113
Look who decided to show up.

24:38.115 --> 24:39.448
KLAUS: Little brother.

24:39.450 --> 24:42.050
You always did love a dramatic entrance.

24:42.052 --> 24:43.818
Well, I prefer them
more than my departures,

24:43.820 --> 24:46.989
which often involved you and
the pointy end of a dagger.

24:49.659 --> 24:51.493
ELIJAH: Now that we're all here...

24:53.897 --> 24:55.497
shall we?

25:06.775 --> 25:08.075
KLAUS: Elijah.

25:10.380 --> 25:13.114
You were always the keeper of our bond,

25:13.116 --> 25:16.517
and because of that, you
will feel this pain the most.

25:16.519 --> 25:19.751
When the inevitable happens,

25:19.754 --> 25:22.087
and I, devoid of family influence,

25:22.090 --> 25:24.991
relapse into a spiral of
mayhem and bloodshed...

25:26.896 --> 25:30.531
I need you to leave me to my fate.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.799
If you come to my rescue

25:32.801 --> 25:34.801
as you have done so many times before,

25:34.803 --> 25:38.171
it will only serve to aid our enemy,

25:38.173 --> 25:41.041
allowing it one step
closer to my daughter,

25:41.043 --> 25:43.743
and I cannot allow that.

25:45.116 --> 25:46.793
So,

25:46.795 --> 25:50.629
my brother...

25:50.631 --> 25:54.433
when the time comes, I beg you,

25:54.435 --> 25:56.602
let me go.

26:10.050 --> 26:11.883
You have my word.

26:20.593 --> 26:23.028
VINCENT: Thank you.

26:23.030 --> 26:26.798
Uh, Kol, if you would, right there.

I just want to say that what
you guys are doing here today

26:55.839 --> 26:57.740
is gonna go a long way
towards setting things right

26:57.742 --> 26:59.107
in this city.

27:00.399 --> 27:03.967
The Hollow took everything away from me.

27:03.969 --> 27:06.936
It inspired nothing but
suffering and torment.

27:06.938 --> 27:09.339

gone after little kids.

27:12.644 --> 27:15.211

27:15.213 --> 27:17.546

27:42.740 --> 27:45.608
Not for a second.

27:45.610 --> 27:48.577

28:07.063 --> 28:08.530

Doesn't it all feel like yesterday?

That funeral procession which took place

30:41.099 --> 30:42.998
just beyond those trees, as I recall,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.299
that sweltering heat.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.334
Amazing that Klaus

30:46.336 --> 30:48.303
was able to see
anything at all, and yet,

You're getting nostalgic
in your old age.

30:59.849 --> 31:01.882
Why'd you ask me here, Elijah?

31:06.289 --> 31:08.523
I'm a danger to my family.

31:08.525 --> 31:10.125
What?

31:10.127 --> 31:12.798
You see, Marcel, my
disease has always been

31:12.801 --> 31:16.538
this blind devotion to my brother.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.481
In a thousand years,

31:18.484 --> 31:20.090
whenever my family has needed me,

31:20.093 --> 31:21.593
I have been there.

31:22.805 --> 31:25.640
And no matter what I do,

31:25.642 --> 31:28.643
I'm at the complete
mercy of that devotion.

31:31.147 --> 31:33.547
I can't do that anymore.

31:33.549 --> 31:36.950
What are you asking me
to do? I don't understand.

You have to end this for me.

31:38.987 --> 31:41.755
What do you want me to do?
You want me to put you down?

31:45.272 --> 31:47.005
I want you to set me free.

an ancient malignant spirit

32:02.678 --> 32:06.412

around inside my skull?

32:13.921 --> 32:15.921
Then I better not dally.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.593
You know, I spent eight glorious months

32:20.595 --> 32:24.129
covered in spit-up,
changing dirty diapers

32:24.131 --> 32:27.099
and reading bedtime
stories to that sweet girl.

32:31.371 --> 32:33.271
Please give this to her.

32:35.209 --> 32:39.211
And tell her that her
Auntie Bex loves her.

32:43.650 --> 32:46.351
Sister, I will fix this.

32:46.353 --> 32:48.386
The Hollow was born on this land,

32:48.388 --> 32:51.223

33:41.105 --> 33:43.406
VINCENT: The Hollow's too powerful.

33:43.408 --> 33:45.941
It's gonna tempt him to try
to get back with his siblings.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.910
If we don't do this, the
Hollow's gonna come back.

33:47.912 --> 33:49.612
What if we're just
creating a monster here?

33:49.614 --> 33:52.447
