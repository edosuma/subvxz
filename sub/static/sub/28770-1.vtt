00:33.447 --> 00:36.381
- What the hell have
you done, savage?

00:49.394 --> 00:52.569
- My daughter will see her
child with one eye only.

00:53.812 --> 00:55.814
Your son will not
see his with two.

01:05.686 --> 01:08.309
We could not protect our
children from violence.

01:09.379 --> 01:10.829
We must do better.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.059
- Shit.

03:31.245 --> 03:35.801
- You have
arrived at your destination.

03:41.428 --> 03:43.015
- Babe, we're here.

03:51.955 --> 03:54.924
♪ Well, it's lucky
I've seen it ♪

04:30.408 --> 04:32.202
- This looks like
your kinda place.

04:36.931 --> 04:39.969
- Welcome, Alice, Vera.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.661
- Thank you, thank you so much.

04:42.696 --> 04:45.043
This place, it's so beautiful.

04:45.975 --> 04:47.425
- You're kind.

04:47.459 --> 04:50.428
This land has been in my
family for generations.

04:50.462 --> 04:52.326
It's been a blessing.

04:52.361 --> 04:56.088
- And I understand there's a
burial mound somewhere nearby?

04:57.331 --> 05:00.092
- Yes, you have
entered a sacred space.

05:01.370 --> 05:02.302
- It's so quiet.

05:03.682 --> 05:07.410
- We say, listen to the silence.

05:07.445 --> 05:08.549
Let it speak to you.

05:09.654 --> 05:12.381
It can bring you peace.

05:16.868 --> 05:18.283
- I'm gonna go get our bags.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.977
- Then I'll give
you the grand tour.

05:48.175 --> 05:50.419
We encourage our guests
to fish the pond.

05:50.453 --> 05:51.558
It's fully stocked.

05:52.731 --> 05:54.837
We only ask that you
eat what you catch

05:54.871 --> 05:56.494
or return it to the pond.

05:56.528 --> 05:58.150
These fish are not for mounting.

06:02.879 --> 06:06.020
- She said these fish
are not for mounting.

06:09.679 --> 06:11.371
- My wife, she has
the sense of humor

06:11.405 --> 06:12.682
of an eight-year-old boy.

06:14.304 --> 06:16.721
- Mounting, like sex.

06:18.757 --> 06:20.483
Having sex with a fish.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.729
Well, taxidermy is
such a clinical term.

06:24.763 --> 06:25.592
- Mm-hmm.

06:38.984 --> 06:39.813
Who's that?

06:41.193 --> 06:42.471
- Oh, that's Sandy.

06:42.505 --> 06:44.265
He's the custodian
of the property.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.128
You'll see him around.

06:45.163 --> 06:47.096
He's a little eccentric,

06:47.130 --> 06:49.995
but he's been with
me for some time.

06:50.030 --> 06:53.205
He's, well, he's family.

06:54.379 --> 06:55.380
- And he lives here?

06:56.899 --> 06:59.729
- Yes, it's always
good to have someone

06:59.764 --> 07:00.972
keeping a watchful eye.

07:04.734 --> 07:07.530
I encourage you to
explore these woods,

07:07.565 --> 07:12.570
but digging is not allowed,
even for archeologists.

07:13.191 --> 07:14.606
- Of course.

07:14.641 --> 07:17.540
- The bones of our dead still
mingle with the soil here,

07:17.575 --> 07:22.096
and about that fact,
we are deadly serious.

07:32.693 --> 07:33.798
- Oh.

07:37.353 --> 07:38.354
- You got us.

07:45.154 --> 07:45.982
- May I?

07:48.088 --> 07:52.092
Obsidian, it's a truth enhancer.

07:52.126 --> 07:54.094
It's said to bring
to the surface

07:54.128 --> 07:56.476
the purest incarnation
of oneself.

07:59.789 --> 08:00.652
It's beautiful.

08:01.688 --> 08:02.689
- Thank you.

08:06.624 --> 08:11.145
- Well, I'll leave you to enjoy.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.078
You have my cell if
you need anything.

08:13.113 --> 08:14.079
- Thank you.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.845
- I'm sorry, I almost forgot,
and this is very important.

08:22.329 --> 08:25.021
Please be mindful of
the property line.

08:25.056 --> 08:27.886
Our neighbors are
vehemently possessive

08:27.921 --> 08:30.440
of their land, as they call it.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.927
- I assume the line
is clearly marked.

08:36.446 --> 08:38.068
- With barbed wire.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.808
- None of the reviews

08:52.842 --> 08:54.326
mentioned the creep
factor around here.

08:56.190 --> 08:58.227
Well, she wasn't that
weird on the phone.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.540
And what was all that,

09:00.574 --> 09:03.128
the bones of our dead are still
mingling with the soil crap?

09:03.163 --> 09:05.786
I mean, come on.

09:05.821 --> 09:08.962
- Well, it is her belief system,

09:08.996 --> 09:12.448
so I don't know why you have
to be so judge-y about it.

09:12.482 --> 09:14.415
- You mean, observant.

09:14.450 --> 09:17.833
- No, no, I mean judgmental.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.145
I mean, I study these
people for a living,

09:20.180 --> 09:21.561
and you're judging them.

09:22.872 --> 09:25.047
- She had a weird energy.

09:25.081 --> 09:26.842
Okay, that's what
I'm trying to say,

09:26.876 --> 09:28.153
but that's all
I'm trying to say.

09:28.188 --> 09:30.535
You don't have to go all
PC police on me, okay?

09:33.227 --> 09:37.404
Hey, I don't want to
fight about stupid shit.

09:38.681 --> 09:40.787
It's not why we're here.

09:40.821 --> 09:42.098
- No, it's not.

09:49.243 --> 09:51.729
- To not fighting
about stupid shit.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.515
And to some more of that.

10:24.071 --> 10:25.072
- I hope so.

10:38.983 --> 10:41.157
- What time is it?

10:41.192 --> 10:42.055
- Late-ish?

10:53.722 --> 10:55.585
- Hey, do you
know what time it is?

10:55.620 --> 10:56.656
- Ally.
- Hey!

10:56.690 --> 10:57.898
- Ally!
- What?

10:57.933 --> 11:00.176
- The man works
here, give him a break.

11:00.211 --> 11:02.903
- Well, I'm just
trying to listen to silence, V.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.396
- I'm not disturbing
you pretty ladies, am I?

11:14.535 --> 11:15.813
- A little bit, yeah.

11:17.228 --> 11:19.057
- Well, I am so sorry.

11:20.403 --> 11:22.820
See, I got a lotta
property I gotta work on.

11:24.131 --> 11:26.064
Much cooler at night, you know?

11:27.514 --> 11:31.104
Man my age gotta be mindful

11:31.138 --> 11:35.556
of his health in
this thick heat.

11:35.591 --> 11:37.904
That heat'll wear you out.

11:37.938 --> 11:38.801
Yes, ma'am.

11:41.631 --> 11:46.119
Oh, I shoulda been mindful
of y'all's privacy too.

11:47.051 --> 11:48.259
Dang me to hell.

11:53.126 --> 11:54.506

11:57.682 --> 12:01.893
- So, y'all girlfriends, huh?

I mean, uh, you know, you're uh,

12:10.005 --> 12:12.766
y'all are romantically entwined.

12:14.147 --> 12:15.838
- That's really none
of your business.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.083
- Um, we're married.

12:22.051 --> 12:25.261
- No, I ain't got no
problem with it, nope.

12:26.538 --> 12:29.507

marijuana, I enjoyed it.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.463
Yeah, I believe that.

13:10.272 --> 13:12.964
Well, I reckon I'll go

13:12.999 --> 13:15.415

up under the shed

13:15.449 --> 13:19.419

more than physical,

21:23.558 --> 21:25.249

and you are
incredibly photogenic.

22:45.985 --> 22:48.090
- That's not an answer.

22:48.125 --> 22:48.919
- Sure it is.

22:50.507 --> 22:52.025
I could ask you the same thing.

22:53.130 --> 22:54.234
Why are you doing this?

22:54.269 --> 22:56.513
- It's something different.

22:56.547 --> 22:59.654
My wife won't have sex
with me, and you will.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.358
- Where'd you go?

23:17.603 --> 23:18.397
Ally?

23:21.158 --> 23:24.368
- Fuck, no where,
I'm, I'm right here.

23:26.612 --> 23:28.407
- You wanna talk now?

24:11.208 --> 24:12.002
- I'm--

24:12.036 --> 24:13.590
- I know, I am too.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.467
Let's go for a walk.

24:39.305 --> 24:41.618
- Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

24:51.351 --> 24:53.492
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

25:00.947 --> 25:01.914
Mornin'!

25:03.950 --> 25:05.469
Feedin' the fish.

25:07.057 --> 25:09.508
How was y'all's
evenin' last night?

25:10.681 --> 25:12.441
- Not quite what we'd hoped.

25:13.822 --> 25:16.584
- It was great, this
is a lovely place.

25:18.447 --> 25:19.276
- Yup.

25:20.242 --> 25:22.555
Y'all headed out to the mound?

25:24.212 --> 25:25.006
- Yes.

25:26.870 --> 25:30.667
- I've always been
intuitive.

25:32.807 --> 25:34.429
- Uh-huh.

25:34.463 --> 25:37.536
- Now, be mindful of
that property line now.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.124
- Will do.

25:43.852 --> 25:44.681
Come on.

25:45.716 --> 25:48.477
- Mm-hmm, all right then.

25:50.410 --> 25:52.309
Here, fishy, fishy, fishy.

26:06.288 --> 26:07.220
- Oh, wow.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.465
Hey baby, what are all
these painted rocks?

26:10.499 --> 26:12.812
- Oh, well, this is
still a very active shrine.

26:14.987 --> 26:17.783
- How many people are
buried out here, do you think?

26:17.817 --> 26:19.129
- Could be hundreds.

26:19.163 --> 26:20.406
- Really?

26:20.440 --> 26:21.269
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.477 --> 26:25.031
See, when a member
of the tribe died,

26:25.066 --> 26:26.446
they would place them

26:26.481 --> 26:29.760
up on an elevated
platform above the mound,

26:29.795 --> 26:34.075
and then family and
friends would leave food,

26:34.109 --> 26:36.733
clothing, sometimes kill
a dog or something--

26:36.767 --> 26:38.113
- What?

26:38.148 --> 26:41.358
- Oh, um, the deceased's dog,

26:41.392 --> 26:44.672
if the deceased had
a companion or a pet,

26:44.706 --> 26:47.433
anything that they believed
would help usher them

26:47.467 --> 26:49.297
on their journey to
the spirit world.

26:50.678 --> 26:53.819
And then, the body would
literally lay above the mound

26:53.853 --> 26:55.406
until the flesh began to rot.

26:56.304 --> 26:57.201
- Gross.

26:57.236 --> 26:58.168
- Yeah.

26:58.202 --> 26:59.928
Well, it gets better.

26:59.963 --> 27:03.483
So, the Choctaw had
what they called

27:03.518 --> 27:06.728
, bone pickers.

27:08.350 --> 27:11.837
See, they would grow the
fingernails really long

27:11.871 --> 27:15.047
because it was their
job to scrape and clean

27:15.081 --> 27:18.050
the decomposing
flesh from the bones,

27:18.084 --> 27:21.916
and then burn it while
friends and family

27:21.950 --> 27:23.676
sang songs of celebration.

27:23.711 --> 27:24.712
- Celebration?

27:26.783 --> 27:28.267
- Well, yes.

27:28.301 --> 27:31.373
You see, with the
flesh destroyed,

27:31.408 --> 27:34.204
the deceased's last
remaining tether

27:34.238 --> 27:37.414
to the material world
would be broken,

27:37.448 --> 27:40.175
and the spirit
could truly be free.

27:40.210 --> 27:42.039
- Hmm.

27:42.074 --> 27:44.663
- So then, they
would take the bones,

27:44.697 --> 27:47.182
and they would place
them inside the mound

27:47.217 --> 27:50.082
and have a great feast with
the bone picker presiding.

27:51.428 --> 27:53.188
- I hope he washed
his hands first.

27:54.327 --> 27:55.570
- Yeah.

27:55.604 --> 27:56.433
- Oh.

27:57.745 --> 27:59.885
You know, I just
don't understand

27:59.919 --> 28:01.680
why anyone would
celebrate death.

28:02.784 --> 28:06.546
I mean, someone is dead,
what's to celebrate?

28:06.581 --> 28:09.066
- Well, I guess that depends
on what you think death is.

28:14.416 --> 28:15.245
You know,

28:17.040 --> 28:19.318
if you just close your eyes

28:22.079 --> 28:23.011
and breathe,

28:24.772 --> 28:27.533
you can really feel
something in this place,

28:29.328 --> 28:32.607
something beyond all this

28:34.022 --> 28:35.299
stuff.

28:42.099 --> 28:42.928
Try.

28:44.101 --> 28:44.930
- Oh.

28:57.839 --> 28:59.358
- What's funny?

28:59.392 --> 29:00.600
- Oh, come--
- What's funny?

29:00.635 --> 29:01.912
- Oh, come on, V,

29:01.947 --> 29:04.950
like you can really feel
something in this place.

29:04.984 --> 29:07.055
- All right, yeah, okay, well,

29:07.090 --> 29:08.781
please don't be
disrespectful, but--

29:08.816 --> 29:11.094
- I'm not being disrespectful.

29:11.128 --> 29:13.130
- Okay, are we done?

29:14.614 --> 29:15.857
Okay, come one.

29:16.858 --> 29:18.204
Ah, you're hopeless.

29:18.239 --> 29:19.274
- Can I have
one of the rocks?

29:19.309 --> 29:20.310
- No.

29:33.633 --> 29:35.946
- The dreaded property line.

29:39.467 --> 29:41.469
Wonder who lives on
the other side of this.

29:41.503 --> 29:43.989
Probably some redneck asshole.

29:44.023 --> 29:45.853
All this beauty grinding
to a screeching halt

29:45.887 --> 29:48.994
with a barbed wire fence
and a cheap Keep Out sign.

29:49.995 --> 29:50.823
- Hey.

29:51.859 --> 29:52.721
- What?

29:54.137 --> 29:54.965
- Kiss me.

30:14.916 --> 30:16.400
Oh my god.

30:16.435 --> 30:17.263
Shit.

30:28.447 --> 30:29.793
- What the fuck?

30:36.558 --> 30:41.356
- You came onto our property,
and your friend's hurt.

30:41.391 --> 30:43.186
- Baby, that looks bad.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.670
- Yeah, it's probably fine,

30:44.704 --> 30:47.190
but I guess I need a
tetanus shot or something.

30:48.363 --> 30:49.675
- Didn't you see the signs?

30:50.779 --> 30:52.920
- Is that a cat?

30:54.093 --> 30:57.476
- Mm-hmm, came
onto our property,

30:57.510 --> 30:58.822
killed one of our chickens.

31:00.065 --> 31:01.894
- Lonny
Barham, where you at?

31:01.929 --> 31:02.999
Lonny Barham!

31:03.033 --> 31:04.552
- At the property line.

31:04.586 --> 31:06.174
We got trespassers.

31:11.731 --> 31:13.664
- Lonny Barham, what did you do?

31:13.699 --> 31:15.183
- I ain't done nothin', Daddy.

31:19.636 --> 31:20.602
- You cut yourself?

31:22.742 --> 31:25.573
- Um, just on the fence, yeah.

31:25.607 --> 31:27.886
- On the fence, on this fence?

31:27.920 --> 31:29.922
- Yeah, that fence.

31:29.957 --> 31:32.304
Do you, your kid killed a cat.

31:37.516 --> 31:38.897
- That the one that
ate our Dominicker hen?

31:38.931 --> 31:40.036
- Mm-hmm.

31:41.416 --> 31:42.901
- That's my boy.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.557
That cat's been wreaking
havoc like a son of a bitch

31:44.592 --> 31:46.939
on our property killin'
all our chickens.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.600
You know, you might
wanna wrap that up.

31:52.634 --> 31:53.428
- I'll be fine.

31:55.361 --> 31:56.466
- You mighty confident.

32:02.817 --> 32:05.130
You best go ahead and
wrap it up, there you go.

32:06.096 --> 32:06.925
Come on, now.

32:09.134 --> 32:10.929
Don't want it to get infected.

32:13.310 --> 32:16.727
My name's Bill
Barham, this is Lonny.

32:16.762 --> 32:17.866
Pleased to meet y'all.

32:20.317 --> 32:21.215
Y'all be safe now.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.529
Come on, kiddo.

32:37.610 --> 32:39.198
- I think we should go.

32:39.233 --> 32:40.165
This place is off.

32:42.029 --> 32:44.514
- Is it any more off
than anywhere else?

32:44.548 --> 32:47.172
Just please remember why we
came here in the first place.

32:47.206 --> 32:49.484
- I mean, yeah, okay,
it's fucked up everywhere,

32:49.519 --> 32:51.486
but at least at home,
we know the score.

32:53.557 --> 32:54.420
- Right.

32:58.493 --> 33:00.633
I guess call blocking
doesn't work on your phone.

33:12.024 --> 33:13.715
- Did you cross
the property line?

33:19.480 --> 33:20.653
- Nita, I--

33:20.688 --> 33:22.724
- Alice, I thought
you might like to see

33:22.759 --> 33:24.554
the results of our latest shoot.

33:25.624 --> 33:26.866
- I'm calling 9-1-1.

33:26.901 --> 33:29.145
- Wait, just give
me a minute, okay?

33:29.179 --> 33:32.941
I just wanted to talk
about what happened.

33:32.976 --> 33:35.875
I feel we had a
misunderstanding.

33:37.843 --> 33:39.810
- You've gotta be kidding.

33:39.845 --> 33:42.882
- I was just stopping by to
see how your stay was going,

33:42.917 --> 33:44.505
and I found him here.

33:44.539 --> 33:46.334
- Thatcher, what the
fuck are you doing?

33:46.369 --> 33:49.579
- I called, quite a few times.

33:49.613 --> 33:51.270
I don't know why I had the
tracker put on the car.

33:51.305 --> 33:52.961
I'm troubled, obviously.

33:57.104 --> 34:01.073
- Look, I don't know what
this is, but whatever it is,

34:01.108 --> 34:03.386
it's not worth you
destroying your life over,

34:03.420 --> 34:05.319
which is what you're
going to do here.

34:07.114 --> 34:11.118
- You must be Vera, the
cold fish professor.

34:17.745 --> 34:21.887
I have long waited to meet you.

34:26.788 --> 34:28.514
- Did you hear what I said?

34:29.826 --> 34:30.654
- I think so.

34:32.415 --> 34:35.900
Why would I be destroying
my life?

34:35.935 --> 34:40.940
I'm, I'm here to make amends
with the woman I love.

34:42.839 --> 34:44.909
That is a noble thing.

34:45.842 --> 34:47.223
Isn't that what you're doing?

34:49.534 --> 34:51.675
Let me ask you a question.

34:51.710 --> 34:54.092
Have you ever had
sex with a camera?

34:57.750 --> 34:59.027
Answer the question.

35:00.167 --> 35:04.274
Have you ever fucked a camera?

35:07.898 --> 35:12.248
See, you can take all the
pictures in the world,

35:13.387 --> 35:18.116
people, places, and
capture emotion,

35:20.739 --> 35:22.948
a perspective, a mood,

35:24.018 --> 35:25.433
bottle it up into celluloid,

35:25.468 --> 35:28.988
or nowadays, into thousands
and thousands of digital pixels

35:29.023 --> 35:31.715
and put 'em in this little
device called a camera.

35:33.683 --> 35:37.583
And be celebrated and paid
handsomely for your work.

35:37.618 --> 35:42.623
Some might even call you
the Great Thatcher Vance,

35:44.383 --> 35:45.971
which of course is empowering.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.389
But the device itself,

35:50.424 --> 35:54.600
the instrument of your success,

35:55.705 --> 35:57.465
it doesn't love you.

35:59.709 --> 36:01.780
It's cold to the touch.

36:03.195 --> 36:08.166
It doesn't satisfy your
basic biological needs.

36:14.241 --> 36:17.105
Of course, you'd know something
about that, wouldn't you?

36:18.210 --> 36:20.178
'Cause you sure weren't
satisfying Ally's.

36:23.388 --> 36:24.975
- Damn you, Thatcher.

36:25.010 --> 36:27.426
- I am really tired of
being beat up by women.

36:28.600 --> 36:33.536
Now, I'd like us to just
sit down and converse

36:34.985 --> 36:37.816
while Alice tells me what she
thinks of our latest shoot.

36:40.715 --> 36:41.544
- You're insane.

36:42.717 --> 36:44.512
- You're still wearing
the necklace I gave you.

36:47.619 --> 36:50.311
- You said you got
that at an artisan's market.

36:53.383 --> 36:54.902
- Mm, really, Ally.

36:56.110 --> 37:00.908
These are better
than the first time.

37:02.634 --> 37:05.292
You remember the first time.

37:12.437 --> 37:13.783
- I remember the last time.

37:14.991 --> 37:16.406
- What are you doing?

37:17.476 --> 37:19.409
I said, I love you.

37:22.101 --> 37:24.276
- Don't you ever put
your hands on me again.

37:28.763 --> 37:30.075
- You crazy bitch.

37:31.456 --> 37:33.872
It's gonna take more than
that to get rid of me though.

37:38.117 --> 37:38.911
So do I.

37:57.413 --> 37:58.793
- What is going on here?

37:58.828 --> 37:59.656
- Bill.

38:03.453 --> 38:07.146
- Now, Nita, don't
go overreacting.

38:07.181 --> 38:10.288
We're simply responding
to a complaint.

38:11.772 --> 38:12.773
- We just saw you.

38:13.670 --> 38:14.499
- Did ya?

38:17.778 --> 38:22.783
We're here in a formal capacity,
just so everyone's clear,

38:24.129 --> 38:25.993
you were caught trespassing
on Barham property,

38:26.027 --> 38:29.686
and you were seen by a child
doing some unsavory things,

38:29.721 --> 38:33.656
which, perhaps ought best
be left behind closed doors,

38:33.690 --> 38:35.140
if done at all.

38:35.174 --> 38:37.591
- You mean the psycho
kid with the dead cat.

38:37.625 --> 38:38.454
- Alice.

38:44.252 --> 38:45.357
- You got spirit.

38:46.910 --> 38:47.877
I like that.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.156
But if you wanna get
off with a warning,

38:51.190 --> 38:53.296
your better keep
your mouth shut.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.366
- A warning for what?

38:55.816 --> 38:59.337
- Sir, we would like to
report an unwanted person.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.547
- An unwanted person?

39:04.272 --> 39:06.205
Is that like a trespasser?

39:06.240 --> 39:07.241
Like what y'all are?

39:08.415 --> 39:11.003
- Sir, look, this is
my ex-girlfriend--

39:11.038 --> 39:12.729
- You have got a lot
of fucking nerve.

39:12.764 --> 39:14.800
- I'm here just trying to
figure some things out.

39:14.835 --> 39:15.801
- You are not wanted here.

39:15.836 --> 39:16.768
- I didn't ask you.

39:16.802 --> 39:17.700
- Hey!

39:17.734 --> 39:19.460
- Did you fucking grab me?

39:20.841 --> 39:21.980
- I'll do whatever
the hell I want.

39:22.014 --> 39:23.499
I'm gonna do a
hell of a lot worse

39:23.533 --> 39:25.121
if you don't calm your ass down.

39:25.155 --> 39:26.260
You understand me?

39:28.642 --> 39:29.470
- Yes, sir.

39:35.442 --> 39:39.411
- Now, I don't know
what kinda weird

39:39.446 --> 39:42.414
ungodly sexual proclivities
your degenerates

39:42.449 --> 39:45.072
have goin' on here, but
I'm gonna tell you this--

39:45.106 --> 39:46.349
- Bill!

39:48.765 --> 39:49.732
- Uncle Sandy.

39:50.836 --> 39:52.838
- I got a bone to pick with you.

39:52.873 --> 39:53.770
- That right?

39:53.805 --> 39:55.462
- What you say we walk over here

39:55.496 --> 39:59.845
and have us a little talky talk.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.227
Jerry.

40:02.261 --> 40:03.401
What the hell's goin' on here?

40:03.435 --> 40:04.781
- You know they crossed
the property line,

40:04.816 --> 40:06.818
you know what that gives
me the right to do.

40:08.475 --> 40:09.993
- You gon'
leave these girls alone.

40:10.028 --> 40:14.273
- I'm gonna do what I'm want
to do.

40:15.723 --> 40:20.728
- Well, that's real
nice of you, Bill, Jerry.

40:21.488 --> 40:22.178
- Y'all have a nice one.

40:23.869 --> 40:25.699
- What was that about?

40:32.809 --> 40:35.329
- Nita, you all right?

40:35.363 --> 40:37.573
- What did you tell him?

40:37.607 --> 40:41.059
- Well, I told him the
truth, that he's an asshole.

40:46.202 --> 40:46.996
Ladies.

40:48.998 --> 40:49.792
Pfft.

40:53.589 --> 40:54.969
- We're leaving.

40:55.004 --> 40:56.592
- I'm afraid that's
not possible.

40:57.558 --> 40:58.386
For any of you.

41:00.665 --> 41:01.700
At least not for now.

41:11.089 --> 41:15.369
We made deals with
devils, heinous men.

41:17.026 --> 41:17.854
- The Barhams?

41:19.546 --> 41:21.755
- They'd encroached on our land.

41:21.789 --> 41:23.204
Our little sliver of the world

41:23.239 --> 41:26.104
seemed to recede
further each season.

41:27.692 --> 41:29.625
We had survived
the Trail of Tears,

41:30.971 --> 41:33.801
but my people had no delusions
about their security.

41:34.906 --> 41:36.597
The mounds themselves
were threatened,

41:37.633 --> 41:39.704
the very soul of our people.

41:41.775 --> 41:45.710
After the war, their
Dark Dragon cult grew,

41:46.607 --> 41:48.816
fueled by fear and blood.

41:50.335 --> 41:53.407
Fear that they would lose the
choke hold they had on power.

41:53.441 --> 41:54.788
- The war?

41:54.822 --> 41:56.030
- Between the States.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.861
- There's a cult?

42:00.448 --> 42:03.521
- My great-great-grandmother,
Coahoma Anoche,

42:04.660 --> 42:07.352
was walking with her dog
in the woods one night

42:07.386 --> 42:10.907
when she stumbled onto their
land, or so they claimed.

42:12.184 --> 42:13.496
The line was muddy then.

42:15.325 --> 42:19.191
One of them saw
her, used some slur.

42:21.021 --> 42:23.575
She didn't back down.

42:23.610 --> 42:25.543
She was a very powerful woman.

42:27.337 --> 42:32.308
Coahoma means red
panther in our language,

42:33.930 --> 42:38.486
and she was worthy of
that name, so strong,

42:40.212 --> 42:43.422
but her strength cost
her dearly that night.

42:44.769 --> 42:49.359
Three of them, sons of Curtwell
Barham, beat her horribly.

42:50.775 --> 42:51.845
She lost an eye.

42:54.261 --> 42:57.851
One of them raped
her, impregnated her.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.993
They left her for dead
at the foot of the mound,

43:03.995 --> 43:04.996
killed her dog,

43:06.998 --> 43:10.864
hung him from a
tree by his tail.

43:10.898 --> 43:12.141
- That's awful.

43:16.283 --> 43:20.459
- Her father, my
great-great-great-grandfather,

43:21.875 --> 43:26.327
was a bone picker, Nashoba
Nawa, the walking wolf.

43:29.537 --> 43:31.332
He was a deeply spiritual man,

43:32.748 --> 43:35.751
but he lost his mind at what
they did to his daughter.

43:37.856 --> 43:41.101
He took his revenge on
Coahoma's attackers.

43:41.135 --> 43:43.206
With his great long fingernails

43:43.241 --> 43:45.139
he ripped their throats
from their bodies

43:45.174 --> 43:46.624
so they couldn't scream

43:46.658 --> 43:49.868
as he peeled their
flesh from their bones

43:49.903 --> 43:52.733
and burned it in the
field behind their barn.

43:53.941 --> 43:58.636
But a baby with Barham
blood was to be born,

44:00.085 --> 44:03.157
the only thing preventing
immediate retaliation.

44:05.297 --> 44:09.094
When the child was born,
Old Man Curtwell Barham

44:09.129 --> 44:11.579
approached Nashoba
with a proposition.

44:13.236 --> 44:16.861
If Nashoba would offer his
life freely to the Barhams,

44:18.345 --> 44:21.900
they would make no claim on
the child and do no violence

44:21.935 --> 44:25.076
to any other members
of our family or tribe.

44:28.044 --> 44:29.597
The slate would be wiped clean,

44:30.737 --> 44:34.637
provided no Choctaw
or guest thereof

44:36.466 --> 44:39.538
ever trespassed on
Barham property again,

44:41.506 --> 44:46.028
for to him, that most
innocent act of Coahoma

44:47.443 --> 44:50.618
resulted in the
deaths of three sons.

44:53.760 --> 44:54.588
Nashoba agreed.

44:56.555 --> 45:00.249
They hung him on a
cross, set fire to it,

45:02.769 --> 45:05.564
and a pact was forged in blood.

45:05.599 --> 45:07.808
- Why have we never
heard any of this before?

45:09.534 --> 45:13.987
- The slate was indeed wiped
clean, just as Curtwell Barham,

45:15.160 --> 45:18.232
then Judge Curtwell
Barham, had promised.

45:19.544 --> 45:23.651
The story exists
now only in memory.

45:23.686 --> 45:26.516
- And we can't leave because?

45:28.104 --> 45:30.003
- The Barhams have
a claim on you now.

45:31.004 --> 45:35.456
You and your guest.

45:37.804 --> 45:39.288
According to the
rules of the pact,

45:39.322 --> 45:42.429
they have 48 hours to decide
whether or not assert it.

45:44.672 --> 45:49.677
But if you leave our land,
I assure you, they will.

45:52.819 --> 45:56.788
- What the actual fuck are
we talking about right now?

46:00.205 --> 46:03.208
- We're talkin' about the
spillin' of your blood,

46:03.243 --> 46:05.970
possibly in a
particularly painful way,

46:07.178 --> 46:10.560
but I mighta warded
off that possibility

46:10.595 --> 46:12.321
if you stay where ya are

46:13.494 --> 46:15.945
and don't trouble the
waters any further.

46:19.846 --> 46:22.745
- Okay, I'm outta here.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.367
Look, get outta my way, old man.

46:25.299 --> 46:28.924
- Name's Sandy, but you right,

46:30.373 --> 46:34.999
I am old, even got a little
bit of sense for all my years.

46:38.243 --> 46:41.695
- So, you're saying we can't
leave for at least 48 hours,

46:41.729 --> 46:43.559
but we may not
even be safe here?

46:44.629 --> 46:45.526
- That's correct.

46:47.080 --> 46:49.185
But I believe this
place will protect you.

46:50.083 --> 46:51.636
It has protected others.

46:53.396 --> 46:55.813
There are many
powerful spirits here.

46:59.126 --> 47:00.818
- I'll take my
chances on the road.

47:02.267 --> 47:05.926
- Thatcher, let's just have
drink and think this over.

48:44.887 --> 48:46.509
- You have done well, my son.

48:48.684 --> 48:52.757
To spill the blood to still
the heart of this invader,

48:52.791 --> 48:55.967
this murderer who has
trespassed our land

48:56.002 --> 48:57.762
and taken what was ours.

49:00.834 --> 49:03.492
We protect our sacred soil

49:03.526 --> 49:07.116
and every living thing
that inhabits it.

49:07.151 --> 49:11.155
Those who defile our land
become an offering in blood.

49:23.443 --> 49:24.962
Give me your hand.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.348
Life is suffering, life is pain,

49:32.383 --> 49:36.076
but there is also glory on
the other side of that pain.

49:44.015 --> 49:47.225
May your blood co-mingle
with this offering,

49:47.260 --> 49:50.228
may it become an
offering in and of itself

49:50.263 --> 49:54.405
acceptable to our Master,
our Lord, the Great Dragon

49:54.439 --> 49:56.372
whose blood has given us life.

50:07.418 --> 50:11.422
Before the staff of our
enemy say what must be said.

50:11.456 --> 50:12.354
- Amen.

50:12.388 --> 50:13.596
- Say it like you mean it.

50:13.631 --> 50:14.735
- Amen.

50:17.842 --> 50:19.292
- Take this vile creature

50:20.465 --> 50:22.329
and hang it by its
tail from a tree

50:22.364 --> 50:24.504
so that every
passerby will know,

50:24.538 --> 50:27.300
so that every passerby
will understand.

50:32.512 --> 50:36.999
Gentlemen, tonight we
have the opportunity

50:37.034 --> 50:40.554

greater than a cat,

and we shall not allow
some Injun burial mound

50:44.144 --> 50:46.284

It stinks and it's offensive.

50:56.915 --> 50:58.779
You cheated on me with a smoker?

51:00.195 --> 51:05.027
- I used to smoke,

57:18.711 --> 57:21.714
You, you can't, somebody,
somebody'll find out.

57:25.718 --> 57:29.446
- Everyone who matters in
this place stands at my side,

57:30.412 --> 57:32.587
and the rest cower in fear.

57:35.935 --> 57:36.798
- Why me, though?

57:37.937 --> 57:40.077
- As opposed to your
dyke friends, you mean?

57:43.080 --> 57:44.461
Well, the short answer is,

57:47.049 --> 57:48.810
they're better
people than you are.

57:52.399 --> 57:54.678
You are and always have been

57:54.712 --> 57:59.165
a self-serving manipulative
lascivious prick

58:00.787 --> 58:04.860
bent and driven only
by your own lusts,

58:07.276 --> 58:11.867
by your insatiable
carnal predilections.

58:15.008 --> 58:17.321
I am right about that, am I not?

58:19.565 --> 58:20.497
- You don't know me.

58:23.292 --> 58:28.090
- I know many things,
but don't worry.

58:30.576 --> 58:32.681
Your girlfriend and her

58:36.582 --> 58:37.410
wife

58:39.619 --> 58:41.518
are not out of the
woods just yet.

58:42.691 --> 58:44.935
- What do you mean by that?

58:48.697 --> 58:52.114
- You did get those bitches'
phones, did you not, Jerry?

58:52.149 --> 58:53.806
- Mm-hmm.

58:53.840 --> 58:54.669
- Good deal.

58:56.291 --> 58:57.154
Good deal.

59:01.089 --> 59:02.711
- Ooh, whoa, ooh, okay.

59:04.057 --> 59:05.024
Okay, ooh.

59:06.197 --> 59:07.854
- Do you like my saber?

59:11.064 --> 59:12.479
It's a family heirloom.

59:15.690 --> 59:20.695
My great-great-great-granddaddy,
Judson Barham

59:21.834 --> 59:24.112
wore and wielded this sword

59:24.146 --> 59:26.045
in the War of
Northern Aggression

59:27.598 --> 59:32.569
as lieutenant in Perrin's
Regiment, 11th cavalry.

59:35.192 --> 59:39.092
And with this sword,
he spilled the blood

59:39.127 --> 59:43.614
of vile Yankee
trespassers and usurpers,

59:43.649 --> 59:46.686
and now, all these years later,

59:48.136 --> 59:50.172
it will spill yours.

59:53.175 --> 59:55.868
Isn't that glorious?

59:58.560 --> 59:59.941
Shall we get started?

01:00:02.771 --> 01:00:07.604
- Can we talk about this?

01:00:58.965 --> 01:01:00.691
You are blessed, my child.

01:01:03.211 --> 01:01:07.491
For blood is life and
blood must have blood.

01:01:09.493 --> 01:01:11.840
Tonight, you will
know the truth,

01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:14.671
and the truth will set you free.

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:26.130
X marks the spot.

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.137
- Glorious night.

01:02:07.171 --> 01:02:08.000
- Yeah.

01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:15.628
- Husband.

01:02:15.662 --> 01:02:16.491
- Wife.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.909
- I brought your wine.

01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:24.085
- Two glasses?

01:02:25.224 --> 01:02:27.744
- I, I thought I
might have a little,

01:02:29.435 --> 01:02:33.094
that we might celebrate together
what is to come tonight.

01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:37.615
- That's mighty
presumptuous of you.

01:02:41.205 --> 01:02:42.275
- Then the shame is mine.

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.658
- But tonight

01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:51.698
our son will see his
first human sacrifice,

01:02:51.733 --> 01:02:54.701
and that indeed is
worthy of celebration,

01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:58.636
so by all means,
pour two glasses.

01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:18.415
To you, Mother.

01:03:28.632 --> 01:03:30.565
- They must have been
inside the house.

01:03:32.498 --> 01:03:35.294
They were inside
the house with us.

01:03:35.328 --> 01:03:36.916
- What are they gonna do to him?

01:03:38.193 --> 01:03:39.643
What have they done?

01:03:39.677 --> 01:03:42.163
So much for this place
protecting us, right?

01:03:42.197 --> 01:03:44.475
I mean, isn't that
what she said?

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:48.514
- I said this place would
protect you, not him.

01:03:52.656 --> 01:03:56.763
The ancestors know the
character of souls.

01:03:58.455 --> 01:04:01.251
Tonight, your friend will die.

01:04:03.943 --> 01:04:06.463
Their thirst for blood
will be satiated.

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:10.570
This will be over,
and you'll be safe.

01:04:12.538 --> 01:04:14.402
It is what has to be now.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.199
- We can't let that happen.

01:04:21.512 --> 01:04:24.895
I don't care who he is

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:28.795
or was to you,

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.145
he's still a human being.

01:04:39.254 --> 01:04:42.085
- Do you know where
they took him?

01:04:43.258 --> 01:04:45.019
- I feared you might
respond this way.

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:50.507
Come.

01:05:08.421 --> 01:05:09.353
- What is this?

01:05:10.251 --> 01:05:12.494
- This is your only hope.

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:18.535
- Y'all ever shot a gun before?

01:05:18.569 --> 01:05:19.398
- Yeah.

01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:22.677
- These are the shells here.

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:34.689
I can tell y'all where
you goin' and what to do,

01:05:35.897 --> 01:05:38.141
but I can't help you
once you get there.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:46.321
- So, if he's one of them,
why would he help us?

01:05:46.356 --> 01:05:48.945
- Sandy's only one
of them by blood,

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:52.949
and that tie is strong,
impenetrable at times,

01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:54.398
but his heart is good.

01:05:54.433 --> 01:05:56.814
- They kill people and
he allows that to happen.

01:05:56.849 --> 01:05:58.782
How do you call that good?

01:05:58.816 --> 01:06:01.992
- You don't know what
Bill Barham is capable of.

01:06:02.027 --> 01:06:07.032
His father, Sandy's brother,
died a relatively young man.

01:06:08.585 --> 01:06:10.621
Bill inherited
his position at 18

01:06:10.656 --> 01:06:14.280
and was drunk on power and
blood from the beginning.

01:06:15.454 --> 01:06:18.008
These last years would
have been far worse

01:06:18.043 --> 01:06:20.769
without Sandy to
mitigate the damage.

01:06:20.804 --> 01:06:23.565
He's more capable of doing
that from the inside.

01:06:31.401 --> 01:06:33.334
This is as far as I go.

01:06:35.129 --> 01:06:37.648
I'll pray the ancestors
watch over you.

01:06:37.683 --> 01:06:41.514
- Come with us,
don't you want this to end?

01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:42.446
- Of course, I do,

01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:48.970
but my birthright was an
oath, sealed with blood,

01:06:51.697 --> 01:06:52.974
and I cannot betray that.

01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:59.774
If you get the chance
to kill Bill Barham,

01:07:00.982 --> 01:07:04.020
whatever the cost,
you must take it.

01:07:06.091 --> 01:07:08.024
He does not know the
meaning of mercy.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.303
Do you understand?

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:16.860
- Yeah.

01:08:03.148 --> 01:08:04.010
Holy shit.

01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:43.636
- Behold, my husband,
my priest, my lord.

01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:38.519
- No, no, no, no.

01:09:38.553 --> 01:09:43.558
- You are blessed, you
are a living sacrifice.

01:09:44.732 --> 01:09:46.768
Your blood is food
for the Dragon,

01:09:47.872 --> 01:09:50.288
the dying and
rising Lord of all.

01:09:57.848 --> 01:09:59.850
Come, my son.

01:10:28.016 --> 01:10:29.121
- Don't come after me.

01:10:30.847 --> 01:10:32.538
- What are you gonna do?

01:10:32.573 --> 01:10:35.955
- I did this, do
not come after me.

01:10:38.303 --> 01:10:43.273
I love you.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:53.249
- It's okay.

01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:55.251
Try again.

01:11:01.878 --> 01:11:05.364
- Let him go, take me instead.

01:11:12.337 --> 01:11:14.649
- And here I was gonna
let you off scot-free.

01:11:17.342 --> 01:11:20.552
- Do whatever you want
to me, just let him go,

01:11:22.036 --> 01:11:23.520
and let my wife go.

01:11:25.936 --> 01:11:26.868
- Whatever I want?

01:11:29.595 --> 01:11:33.358
That's tempting, it truly is,

01:11:33.392 --> 01:11:37.810
but you are standing on my
land, and for that reason alone,

01:11:37.845 --> 01:11:41.607
I can do whatever the hell
I want to you regardless.

01:12:00.695 --> 01:12:01.662
You're not a killer.

01:12:03.905 --> 01:12:08.910
A moral reprobate maybe,
a doer of unnatural deeds,

01:12:10.602 --> 01:12:13.259
but not a killer, I know.

01:12:15.089 --> 01:12:18.230
You wanna take his
place, I can accept that.

01:12:19.714 --> 01:12:24.167
Give me the gun,
or you can shoot me

01:12:25.582 --> 01:12:29.414
and ensure that you, he,
and your pretty girlfriend

01:12:29.448 --> 01:12:31.243
end up strung up on a cross!

01:12:43.117 --> 01:12:43.945
Jerry!

01:12:46.776 --> 01:12:50.193
Saved by a woman, disgusting.

01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:52.575
Untie him.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.999
Get off my land.

01:13:06.485 --> 01:13:10.627
Friends, we have
new blood, take her.

01:13:22.294 --> 01:13:24.848
I hope you fully appreciate
what you've done.

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.095
If not, you will soon.

01:13:33.892 --> 01:13:34.789
- No!

01:13:36.998 --> 01:13:39.484
- No, damn it, Vera!

01:13:39.518 --> 01:13:40.381
Run, run!

01:13:41.831 --> 01:13:42.659
- You missed!

01:13:46.491 --> 01:13:47.319
Go get her.

01:13:48.734 --> 01:13:50.909
- No, no, that wasn't the
deal, please, leave her, no.

01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:53.739
Vera!

01:13:55.948 --> 01:13:57.502
- Wait.
- Damn it.

01:13:57.536 --> 01:13:59.745
God.

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.333
- We'll just take
this hero here.

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:15.416
Take her to the stall.

01:14:30.293 --> 01:14:31.605
- Come on, get up.

01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:52.073
Okay.

01:14:55.214 --> 01:14:56.043
Okay.

01:14:59.874 --> 01:15:01.186
Okay, let's just.

01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:05.535
Shh.

01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:12.231
You're too heavy,
I don't know if I.

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:20.170
- She, she never loved me.

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:29.283
She never stopped lovin' you

01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:33.218
and that got to me.

01:15:35.116 --> 01:15:37.084
- Why me?

01:15:37.118 --> 01:15:38.603
- Because I'm a photographer,

01:15:38.637 --> 01:15:41.813
and you're incredibly
photogenic.

01:15:44.712 --> 01:15:46.093
- That's not an answer.

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:48.198
- Sure it is.

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:53.514
I could ask you the
same thing, why me?

01:15:54.757 --> 01:15:56.137
You're not even into dudes.

01:15:57.622 --> 01:16:02.109
- I used to be into guys, but
I needed something different.

01:16:03.869 --> 01:16:06.492
My wife won't have sex with me,

01:16:07.873 --> 01:16:09.841
but that doesn't mean
I don't love her.

01:16:11.049 --> 01:16:12.533
She's the only person

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.053
I could ever really see
myself loving in that way.

01:16:20.955 --> 01:16:23.302
But this is about one thing.

01:16:31.828 --> 01:16:33.623
- Okay, we gotta go.

01:16:33.658 --> 01:16:36.143
We gotta go, come on.

01:16:36.177 --> 01:16:38.766
Come on.

01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:57.992
- It's a big deal to
postpone the ritual,

01:17:02.272 --> 01:17:04.136
but for you, I'm
making an exception.

01:17:16.908 --> 01:17:21.913
But how to purify for the
glorious death that is to come?

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:27.159
With a blade?

01:17:34.615 --> 01:17:35.443
A whip?

01:17:41.726 --> 01:17:42.554
A cane.

01:17:46.282 --> 01:17:48.042
There are so many options.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:54.497
Jerry.

01:17:56.326 --> 01:17:57.845
Go see about my wife and child.

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:08.649
You too, Winslow.

01:18:18.521 --> 01:18:23.491
Now that I think about it,
there is another option.

01:18:29.635 --> 01:18:30.464
Hell,

01:18:35.469 --> 01:18:39.024
it might even fix you,

01:18:41.475 --> 01:18:46.204
purge you of your aberrant
desire for the same sex.

01:18:47.619 --> 01:18:50.864
You have, of course,
been with men,

01:18:56.283 --> 01:18:59.527
but you have never
been with one like me.

01:18:59.562 --> 01:19:01.806
- You have a wife, a child.

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:10.780
- King Solomon had 700
wives and 300 concubines.

01:19:12.264 --> 01:19:14.473
You, of course, would fall
into the latter category,

01:19:14.508 --> 01:19:16.268
if I were to let you live,

01:19:19.962 --> 01:19:24.587
if I were to let her live.

01:19:32.215 --> 01:19:36.599
What would you say if I
offered you such a proposition?

01:19:40.292 --> 01:19:41.397
- If you let her live.

01:19:44.503 --> 01:19:45.332
- Deal.

01:19:59.173 --> 01:20:00.002
- Untie me.

01:20:32.344 --> 01:20:37.349
- I am man, superior
in every way to woman.

01:20:39.973 --> 01:20:42.596
Inside me lives a dragon,

01:20:45.633 --> 01:20:50.328
and now, I shall show you
the meaning of suffering.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:04.687
Get up.

01:21:08.449 --> 01:21:09.278
- Nita, Nita!

01:21:13.144 --> 01:21:13.972
Whoa.

01:21:15.525 --> 01:21:17.734
He's lost a lot of
blood, he needs a doctor.

01:21:20.151 --> 01:21:22.118
- He's lost too much
blood, I'm afraid.

01:21:23.706 --> 01:21:26.191
- Do something, damn it!

01:21:26.226 --> 01:21:29.608
How are you gonna just let these
monsters do this to people?

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.475
- Let me make a call.

01:21:39.584 --> 01:21:40.516
- I'm sorry.

01:22:12.513 --> 01:22:14.791
- It doesn't take much of a man

01:22:14.826 --> 01:22:16.517
to torture a helpless victim.

01:22:21.867 --> 01:22:24.940
- Oh, you're
helpless now, are ya?

01:22:28.081 --> 01:22:30.083
You mean, you're to my equal.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.605
Isn't that what you
feminists think?

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.333
That a woman is somehow
the same as a man?

01:22:43.475 --> 01:22:48.377
I would imagine that belief
is prevalent among your kind.

01:22:56.523 --> 01:22:59.836
You're gonna like this
better from behind.

01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:14.644
You know, in certain
Asian countries,

01:23:14.679 --> 01:23:17.509
caning is a punishment
reserved for men only.

01:23:19.097 --> 01:23:20.926
Since you wanna be one so badly,

01:23:22.549 --> 01:23:24.585
I figured it was a
good place to start.

01:23:33.422 --> 01:23:34.250
- Bill.

01:23:35.217 --> 01:23:36.632
- What?

01:23:36.666 --> 01:23:38.358
Can't you see I'm in
the middle of somethin'?

01:23:40.325 --> 01:23:41.499
- I can see that.

01:23:42.569 --> 01:23:45.399
You need to go see to your son.

01:23:45.434 --> 01:23:48.264
He's all shook up about
what he's seen earlier.

01:23:49.127 --> 01:23:50.956
I don't think he's ready for it.

01:23:52.855 --> 01:23:56.238
- You presume to educate
me about my own son?

01:23:58.309 --> 01:24:00.242
He's got a stronger
stomach than that.

01:24:02.278 --> 01:24:04.453
Anyway, Jerry's
seein' about him.

01:24:05.937 --> 01:24:09.113
- He ain't never seen a man's
flesh fallin' from his bones.

01:24:11.184 --> 01:24:13.013
He ain't never been asked

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:16.465
to nail a human being
to a board before.

01:24:18.122 --> 01:24:21.056
That's a long way from
a 'possum or a cat.

01:24:25.646 --> 01:24:30.030
He needs his father to
help him understand better

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.100
what it all means.

01:24:35.035 --> 01:24:36.278
- Can you take over here?

01:24:40.454 --> 01:24:41.283
Can ya?

01:24:43.043 --> 01:24:43.837
- Yup.

01:24:46.943 --> 01:24:48.428
- All right, then.

01:24:57.747 --> 01:24:59.163
I'm gonna stick around
for the first lick

01:24:59.197 --> 01:25:01.579
just to make sure you're
not holding somethin' back.

01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:11.623
Get on with it, I'm tryin'
to go see about my son.

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:20.943
Good, carry on.

01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:41.550
- This is gonna
cost me, you know?

01:25:42.516 --> 01:25:44.000
Nita's my daughter.

01:25:46.313 --> 01:25:47.832
Her mama died havin' her.

01:25:49.454 --> 01:25:54.183
I insisted she keep her mama's
name, good Choctaw name,

01:25:54.218 --> 01:25:57.290
so she wouldn't be polluted
by the Barham name.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.570
Take her away from here.

01:26:02.605 --> 01:26:03.572
She's got a.

01:26:05.574 --> 01:26:06.402
- A what?

01:26:07.507 --> 01:26:09.164
- Well, you best
better be goin'.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.339
Go on!

01:26:39.953 --> 01:26:42.645
- Your technique
needs a little work.

01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:57.384
- Bill!

01:27:56.409 --> 01:28:00.275
- I always wondered what it
felt like to wear this thing.

01:29:13.244 --> 01:29:16.454
- Bill's gonna get
his saber back.

01:29:43.101 --> 01:29:44.724
- Ally!

01:29:44.758 --> 01:29:47.968
Oh my god, are you,
how did you even?

01:29:48.003 --> 01:29:49.556
Baby, are you okay?

01:29:49.591 --> 01:29:52.939
- I don't know, no, yes,
we don't have much time.

01:29:54.803 --> 01:29:58.013
Her, she's his daughter.

01:30:00.084 --> 01:30:01.430
- What?

01:30:01.465 --> 01:30:05.123
- Sandy, motherfucking
Sandy, she's his daughter, V.

01:30:07.194 --> 01:30:09.749
- Oh, okay, we need
to get you inside.

01:30:09.783 --> 01:30:12.407
- What is going on
with this fucked up

01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:13.925
incestuous family?
- Ally, Ally.

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.788
- What?

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.723
- This is Nita's family,

01:30:20.794 --> 01:30:24.936
and um, Thatcher didn't make it.

01:30:30.459 --> 01:30:32.668
And um, I tried, I'm sorry.

01:30:35.015 --> 01:30:36.534
- May I tend to your wound?

01:30:39.572 --> 01:30:41.436
- I don't know.

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:43.472
- Minco's a nurse.

01:30:48.339 --> 01:30:49.305
- Thank you.

01:31:10.016 --> 01:31:11.258
They're coming.

01:31:20.544 --> 01:31:21.441
- Get your traitorous

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.305
ass down.
- Oh, goddamn.

01:31:40.391 --> 01:31:44.050
- Tonight has been unexpected.

01:31:47.053 --> 01:31:50.505
We have traveled from the
verge of glorious sacrifice

01:31:50.539 --> 01:31:53.300
to the loss of two of our own.

01:31:56.234 --> 01:31:58.789
For this, I shoulder
my share of the blame.

01:32:02.068 --> 01:32:06.210
But a society that has
normalized debauchery,

01:32:06.244 --> 01:32:11.215
women and men embracing unnatural
desires and inclinations,

01:32:11.249 --> 01:32:13.700
this too must be
taken into account.

01:32:17.428 --> 01:32:19.119
But more importantly,

01:32:20.742 --> 01:32:25.747
betrayal, deep, disgraceful,

01:32:26.851 --> 01:32:30.337
and familial has branded
our tribe tonight.

01:32:35.066 --> 01:32:35.895
You.

01:32:38.967 --> 01:32:42.384
I only kept you close, hell,
perhaps even kept you alive

01:32:42.418 --> 01:32:43.937
out of respect for my father.

01:32:43.972 --> 01:32:46.250
I see now that was a mistake.

01:32:48.597 --> 01:32:49.425
But maybe,

01:32:52.636 --> 01:32:55.466
maybe you might help me
achieve my end tonight

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:58.331
before you receive
your just desserts.

01:33:02.162 --> 01:33:04.233
Won't be long now, Uncle.

01:33:06.063 --> 01:33:07.409
- Go to hell, Bill.

01:33:10.895 --> 01:33:12.828
- Daddy, Daddy!

01:33:20.698 --> 01:33:24.875
- He, he was goin' crazy,
wanted to be with his daddy.

01:33:25.772 --> 01:33:27.394
- I wanna come with you!

01:33:27.429 --> 01:33:28.810
I wanna see you purify them.

01:33:31.053 --> 01:33:33.159
- Thought you was
all shook up earlier.

01:33:33.193 --> 01:33:34.022
- I'm better now.

01:33:36.887 --> 01:33:38.026
- What you think, Mama?

01:33:41.236 --> 01:33:45.999
- The decision is yours,
my husband and my lord.

01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:17.479
- You need to learn
to control your son.

01:34:19.515 --> 01:34:20.896
He ain't a man yet.

01:34:20.931 --> 01:34:21.966
You understand me?

01:34:23.347 --> 01:34:24.175
- Yes.

01:34:26.246 --> 01:34:27.420
- You wanna come, boy?

01:34:28.766 --> 01:34:31.286
See your legacy up
close and personal?

01:34:33.737 --> 01:34:34.599
Come on.

01:34:37.119 --> 01:34:39.501
You go home, prepare.

01:34:39.535 --> 01:34:42.090
I truly do not know what
is to come of tonight.

01:34:50.408 --> 01:34:53.929
May the Dragon purify this
world with fire and blood

01:34:53.964 --> 01:34:56.794
and may we be his instruments.

01:34:56.829 --> 01:34:57.692
Give me that.

01:34:59.728 --> 01:35:01.661
Get up, get your ass up.

01:35:22.647 --> 01:35:26.306
- Drive as far and as fast as
you can, and don't look back.

01:35:27.307 --> 01:35:28.688
- What will you do?

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:30.655
- Trust the ancestors.

01:35:33.831 --> 01:35:35.419
- I admire your faith.

01:35:36.351 --> 01:35:37.593
- What else is there now?

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.497
- I'm afraid you can't leave.

01:35:45.463 --> 01:35:46.361
- What?

01:35:46.395 --> 01:35:47.983
- They're here.

01:35:48.018 --> 01:35:50.503
- Minco, take our
daughter away from here.

01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:51.987
- I won't leave you.

01:35:52.022 --> 01:35:53.678
- You must and you will.

01:35:53.713 --> 01:35:56.095
I'll handle my family,
you protect ours.

01:36:04.034 --> 01:36:04.862
Go out the back.

01:36:34.029 --> 01:36:37.032
- Get the shotgun and the sword.

01:36:42.141 --> 01:36:44.005
- You gonna regret this, nephew.

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:49.424
- How in the hell you
think that's gonna happen?

01:36:52.496 --> 01:36:54.015
Nita!

01:36:54.049 --> 01:36:57.087
You send those depraved
murderous dykes out here

01:36:57.121 --> 01:36:58.882
right now with my saber

01:36:58.916 --> 01:37:02.851
or I'm gonna put a bullet in
your daddy's traitorous brain!

01:37:02.886 --> 01:37:03.714
You hear me?

01:37:13.137 --> 01:37:17.590
- Don't you worry about me,.

01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:19.730
Don't you worry about me.

01:37:20.904 --> 01:37:22.595
- You shut your
treacherous mouth!

01:37:27.703 --> 01:37:31.949
Fox King, bring my pistol.

01:37:45.894 --> 01:37:47.206
- I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:37:48.586 --> 01:37:50.968
- You're not the one he wants.

01:37:51.003 --> 01:37:51.831
I should go.

01:37:53.074 --> 01:37:55.524
- If you go, I'm going with you.

01:37:57.457 --> 01:38:00.081
I just got you back, I'm
not leaving your side again.

01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:10.470
- I want you to pay close
attention now, Nita.

01:38:21.861 --> 01:38:24.312
- Son of a bitch.

01:38:24.346 --> 01:38:27.039
- Please, don't do anything

01:38:27.073 --> 01:38:29.420
until I've exhausted
all options.

01:38:30.732 --> 01:38:32.044
- What options?

01:38:33.977 --> 01:38:36.289
- I shall not ask again, Nita.

01:38:38.809 --> 01:38:39.637
- No.

01:38:41.087 --> 01:38:41.916
Please.

01:38:43.607 --> 01:38:44.435
Wait.

01:38:46.196 --> 01:38:47.438
We can solve this.

01:38:48.819 --> 01:38:51.201
- I told you how we solve it.

01:38:52.478 --> 01:38:53.997
- This has to end, Bill.

01:38:55.412 --> 01:38:58.898
So many of our own have
suffered, and for what end?

01:39:00.624 --> 01:39:03.868
- How can you say that to
me after what Nashoba did?

01:39:06.147 --> 01:39:08.321
To take our precious Barham boys

01:39:08.356 --> 01:39:12.947
from their own beds on
their own sacred soil

01:39:12.981 --> 01:39:16.329
and to massacre them like
hogs to the slaughter.

01:39:16.364 --> 01:39:17.710
- They were not innocent,

01:39:18.849 --> 01:39:20.989
and Nashoba gave
his life as surety.

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:27.099
Cousin, our blood
is co-mingled now.

01:39:28.652 --> 01:39:29.894
We are the same.

01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:35.314
And the soil, whether
here or there,

01:39:38.593 --> 01:39:40.491
never belonged to
either of us anyway.

01:39:42.528 --> 01:39:46.118
We have the power
to lay this to rest.

01:39:46.152 --> 01:39:47.291
- I have the power!

01:39:49.431 --> 01:39:51.019
The Dragon gave it to me.

01:39:52.193 --> 01:39:53.677
Goodbye, Nita.

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:55.334
- No!

01:39:57.715 --> 01:39:58.544
No!

01:40:10.659 --> 01:40:12.178
You son of a bitch.

01:40:12.213 --> 01:40:13.421
You son of a bitch.

01:40:14.318 --> 01:40:15.147
- Shut up.

01:40:17.218 --> 01:40:19.116
I wanted you to
see your daughter

01:40:19.151 --> 01:40:22.706
bathed in her own
blood before you died.

01:40:28.574 --> 01:40:30.024
How does it feel?

01:40:31.715 --> 01:40:35.132
You take the Dragon's
prize, he takes from you.

01:40:38.963 --> 01:40:43.934
Now, maybe you understand,
actions have consequences.

01:40:48.421 --> 01:40:49.215
- Wait.

01:41:07.647 --> 01:41:08.476
You were right.

01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:13.101
Actions do have consequences.

01:41:15.207 --> 01:41:16.691
I'm to blame.

01:41:16.725 --> 01:41:20.212
I manipulated Sandy because
I couldn't manipulate you.

01:41:22.317 --> 01:41:24.595
I'm the one you want.

01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:28.151
I'm the vile thing that
set this all in motion.

01:41:29.290 --> 01:41:30.601
- Yes, you are,

01:41:33.190 --> 01:41:34.467
but so what?

01:41:36.055 --> 01:41:39.714
You belong to me, and so
does your pretty wife.

01:41:39.748 --> 01:41:40.577
- Please.

01:41:43.027 --> 01:41:44.098
We made a mistake.

01:41:45.961 --> 01:41:49.862
We never meant you or
your family any harm.

01:41:51.519 --> 01:41:53.762
We didn't even know that
we crossed the line.

01:41:56.317 --> 01:41:58.042
We only came to this place

01:41:59.216 --> 01:42:03.220
because we just wanted
to find some peace and.

01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:13.575
- There is no peace here,
only fire and blood.

01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:17.545
- I can't breathe.

01:42:17.579 --> 01:42:18.373
- That's the idea.

01:42:18.408 --> 01:42:19.236
- Stop!

01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:27.831
- Bring me my saber.

01:42:33.423 --> 01:42:38.428
Now.

01:42:45.745 --> 01:42:47.920
Kneel and place
it on the ground.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.242
I see now it should have
been you from the beginning,

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:06.525
but that's all behind
us, isn't it, Alice?

01:43:08.975 --> 01:43:13.980
Know this, your wife will
suffer horribly for your sins,

01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:18.951
and we shall rejoice
in her suffering.

01:43:27.718 --> 01:43:31.412
Watch closely, son, do
not avert your eyes.

01:44:21.324 --> 01:44:23.118
- I am woman, you
son of a bitch,

01:44:23.153 --> 01:44:25.880
and a fuckin' dragon
lives inside me too.

01:44:59.741 --> 01:45:00.535
- Come.

01:45:06.092 --> 01:45:08.302
I told you about this place.

01:45:10.407 --> 01:45:13.928
- But they didn't protect
you, the ancestors.

01:45:17.172 --> 01:45:18.001
- Protected you.

01:45:20.693 --> 01:45:21.660
It is said

01:45:24.179 --> 01:45:29.115
our , Nanishta

01:45:30.945 --> 01:45:34.362
gave hearts to women
closer to its own

01:45:35.915 --> 01:45:38.504
than those that it gave to men.

01:45:40.403 --> 01:45:42.819
I see that in the two of you.

01:46:36.804 --> 01:46:39.600
- This is over right now.

01:46:40.635 --> 01:46:41.843
Y'all hear me?

01:46:43.224 --> 01:46:46.745
I'm next in line, I'm
callin' a halt to it.

01:46:46.779 --> 01:46:49.437
- Traitor, Lonny is the heir!

01:46:49.472 --> 01:46:53.234
- When he's of age, he is,
but he ain't there yet.

01:46:54.615 --> 01:46:57.065
I'm the only Barham
standing here right now,

01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:59.930
and I'm tellin' you, it's done.

01:47:02.761 --> 01:47:04.797
I made my decision, I made it.

01:47:06.627 --> 01:47:10.424
Bill didn't agree, but
he ain't around no more.

01:47:13.081 --> 01:47:18.086
Barham blood must hold the
priesthood of the Dragon.

01:47:21.227 --> 01:47:22.574
Ain't that the way it goes?

01:47:25.749 --> 01:47:29.926
Y'all gonna leave these ladies
alone to go their own way,

01:47:32.756 --> 01:47:36.104
and y'all gonna help me
clean up this god-awful mess.

01:47:38.831 --> 01:47:40.695
And I know you
know a thing or two

01:47:40.730 --> 01:47:44.803
about cleanin' up messes, Judge.

01:47:46.494 --> 01:47:48.013
You too, Mayor.

01:47:50.533 --> 01:47:52.845
Or y'all can try to kill me.

01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:57.125
You can sure try.

01:48:00.577 --> 01:48:03.960
But you gonna go ahead and
make a decision right now.

01:48:06.859 --> 01:48:10.138
Go on.

01:48:12.762 --> 01:48:14.349
- Everyone.

01:49:02.363 --> 01:49:04.330
- It'll be dawn soon.

01:49:04.365 --> 01:49:06.298
- Longest night of my life.

01:49:07.886 --> 01:49:11.268
- Look, let's just get a motel,

01:49:11.303 --> 01:49:14.375
something so we
can sleep, regroup.

01:49:15.376 --> 01:49:16.791
- Yeah.

01:49:16.826 --> 01:49:18.586
- Once we're far, far
away from here, obviously.

01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:22.728
You okay?

01:49:24.592 --> 01:49:25.386
- I'll live.

01:49:28.976 --> 01:49:29.804
- I love you.

01:49:32.082 --> 01:49:32.911
- I love you.

01:49:35.879 --> 01:49:37.329
- We're gonna make this work.

01:49:52.137 --> 01:49:53.310
Let's go home.

01:49:54.277 --> 01:49:55.105
- Yeah.

01:50:18.508 --> 01:50:20.648
I'm sorry about Nita.

01:51:24.988 --> 01:51:25.955
We slept late.

01:51:30.684 --> 01:51:32.030
- Guess we were worn out.

01:51:37.276 --> 01:51:38.105
- Coffee?

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:40.486
- Yeah.

01:51:40.521 --> 01:51:41.349
- Yeah.

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.853
- I fixed that busted
pipe underneath the house.

01:52:02.992 --> 01:52:04.856
Shouldn't have no
more problem with it.

01:52:10.413 --> 01:52:12.380
I gotta go to the
other property.

01:52:21.355 --> 01:52:24.979
Stella, you know it was
the right thing, don't ya?

01:52:36.542 --> 01:52:38.717
Whatcha drawin' there, Lonny?

01:52:51.178 --> 01:52:52.766
