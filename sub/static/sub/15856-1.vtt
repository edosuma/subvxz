01:13.876 --> 01:15.514
I've got Talia.

01:20.996 --> 01:22.952
All right, let's do this thing.

01:30.996 --> 01:32.190
Transfer's confirmed.

01:32.276 --> 01:34.744
-Move in.
-That's very good.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.670
This is the FBl.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.753
The building is surrounded.
You're all under arrest.

01:42.196 --> 01:44.266
I repeat, you're all under arrest.

01:44.556 --> 01:45.989
Put your hands up.

01:47.356 --> 01:48.471
This is the FBl!

01:52.276 --> 01:55.348
Sonny Talia, you're under arrest.

01:55.636 --> 01:59.470
Oh, yeah? For what? lmport, export?

02:01.836 --> 02:05.226
Calm down, buddy.
Here's my bill of lading.

02:05.716 --> 02:09.503
Coffee, paint, computer chips
and lawn chairs.

02:11.156 --> 02:13.624
There's nothing in here but lawn chairs.

02:14.556 --> 02:17.070
Hey, sweetheart, you're a beautiful girl.

02:17.276 --> 02:18.994
If you get tired of the FBl...

02:19.076 --> 02:22.671
...you can come and work for me
in one of my dance joints.

02:23.316 --> 02:25.113
Bring in Agent 1 1 !

02:43.596 --> 02:44.745
Agent 1 1 ...

02:45.276 --> 02:46.345
...search!

03:13.916 --> 03:15.065
What's this?

03:18.956 --> 03:19.866
Go!

04:03.156 --> 04:04.828
Get away from me!

04:08.156 --> 04:09.225
Agent 1 1 !

04:43.595 --> 04:46.393
Bleeker Street. Dog town.

04:51.035 --> 04:52.787
Canine Alley.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.627
No, you don't.

05:16.115 --> 05:19.027
Come on, Spike.
Can't we do this nice, just once?

05:22.075 --> 05:24.305
All right. You asked for it.

05:26.755 --> 05:29.189
What do we got here? Go get the chicken.

05:29.315 --> 05:30.748
Go get the chicken.

05:38.595 --> 05:40.392
Psych, Spike!

05:46.515 --> 05:47.868
Come on, Boodles.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.834
We gotta stop meeting like this.
I'm telling you.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.349
It costs me $20 a week in meatballs.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.789
Let's do it again. Go get the meatball!

06:05.635 --> 06:08.627
Where are you?
Where is that stinking dog?

06:29.395 --> 06:30.748
Well, well, well.

06:34.275 --> 06:37.233
What's up, Tyson? You on lock-down?

06:37.395 --> 06:42.105
Want to get the mail?
Want to get the mailman? Come on, try!

06:51.315 --> 06:52.668
Too fast!

06:58.835 --> 07:03.067
Who am l? MC Hammer! You know why?
Because you can't touch this.

07:16.675 --> 07:18.233
Not today, Tyson!

07:24.595 --> 07:28.144
Here you are, baby.
Signed, sealed, delivered.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.270
Thank you, Benny. I'll see you tomorrow?

07:31.355 --> 07:35.633
Oh, yeah. And remember,
if there's anything I can do for you...

07:35.795 --> 07:38.309
...all you have to do is raise that flag...

07:38.955 --> 07:43.346
...and I'll come through for you, baby.
Rain, sleet or snow.

07:45.395 --> 07:47.909
This postman always delivers.

07:49.315 --> 07:50.509
Damn.

07:53.755 --> 07:58.033
Oh, hey, Gordon. What's up, man?
You're looking smooth, brother.

07:58.675 --> 07:59.790
Tyson again?

08:02.355 --> 08:03.993
Yeah, but I'm cool.

08:04.355 --> 08:08.314
That dog's on an all-white-meat diet.
He never did that to no brother.

08:09.075 --> 08:11.714
-That's not funny.
-Yes, it is.

08:12.275 --> 08:16.268
Why don't you request a different route
if he's giving you a hard time?

08:16.475 --> 08:19.148
There's not a dog on this planet
that can scare me.

08:19.235 --> 08:20.429
Okay, brother.

08:26.475 --> 08:28.352
That's funny. That's hysterical.

08:28.435 --> 08:30.266
Come on, baby. They're just jokes.

08:30.355 --> 08:33.745
-Don't get postal on me.
-Postal? I'm not postal.

08:34.034 --> 08:38.153
Don't even play with me like that.
You know all white people are crazy.

08:39.235 --> 08:41.351
I'll check you back at the crib.

08:42.515 --> 08:45.109
Hey, G. You can keep that dog, dog.

08:46.435 --> 08:47.390
Get it, dog?

08:57.435 --> 08:59.391
Here's some good news, Mr. Talia.

08:59.475 --> 09:03.434
The metal ball bearing we inserted
to replace your missing appendage...

09:03.635 --> 09:06.274
...should help you maintain
a natural appearance.

09:06.355 --> 09:08.915
Luckily we were able
to save the other one...

09:08.995 --> 09:12.146
...or else we'd have to put in two,
and when you walk....

09:18.275 --> 09:20.425
It's just a little urological humor.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.984
Sonny, let it go, please!
Listen, Sonny, it's okay.

09:25.195 --> 09:27.755
The prosecution has
absolutely nothing on you.

09:27.835 --> 09:32.545
You're a businessman with a valid bill
of lading for importation.

09:32.755 --> 09:35.394
They can't prove
prior knowledge or possession.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.148
They got no case!

09:38.915 --> 09:41.031
I'm not worried about that right now.

09:41.115 --> 09:44.994
What I'm worried about is this
Agent 1 1 dog. It's always this dog.

09:45.195 --> 09:48.392
He made me lose $22 million
in the last three years.

09:48.595 --> 09:51.029
And now he made me lose, he made me....

09:51.555 --> 09:53.785
You know, Sonny, you only need one.

09:53.995 --> 09:58.432
-Then give me one of yours.
-Just looking on the bright side.

09:58.635 --> 10:02.753
-You can't do anything about the dog.
-Yes, I can.

10:06.675 --> 10:09.348
Man's best friend. Bad dog!

10:21.235 --> 10:22.793
I'm sorry, buddy.

10:29.755 --> 10:30.824
Hey, baby.

10:32.315 --> 10:35.910
Steph, someone has mailed you
a stuffed dog.

10:36.715 --> 10:39.627
Rick, the shoot for Slick and Slimy
is down the hall.

10:40.115 --> 10:42.390
-Gordon!
-Hey, Steph.

10:45.635 --> 10:48.024
This isn't a good time for me right now.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.431
I got James a little present here.

10:52.395 --> 10:57.105
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.
All he's been talking about is dogs.

10:57.315 --> 11:00.466
He doesn't understand
you can't have one in an apartment.

11:00.555 --> 11:03.831
Honey, come here.
Gordon's got something for you.

11:07.475 --> 11:10.433
What's up, little man?
Look what Uncle Gordon got you!

11:10.635 --> 11:13.752
I'm not really your uncle,
so if I kiss your mom...

11:15.275 --> 11:16.503
...that's okay.

11:17.875 --> 11:21.072
Don't worry, James.
There's no chance of that happening.

11:22.435 --> 11:24.153
Hey, pal, what do we say?

11:25.715 --> 11:27.467
Thank you.

11:30.755 --> 11:34.350
I like dogs.
I'm gonna keep you for a long time.

11:35.555 --> 11:38.547
Yo, Steph. This guy's whacky.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.710
Hello. Yeah, Daisy? Flight's at 9:00.

11:47.795 --> 11:49.751
You waltz in here with that toy...

11:49.835 --> 11:52.474
...thinking you can buy back
Stephanie through her son?

11:52.555 --> 11:54.511
You're mad you didn't think of it first.

11:54.595 --> 11:58.110
I don't have to. I'm here because
she wants a real man around the house.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.948
Are you gonna go arrest one
and bring him home to her?

12:01.035 --> 12:02.787
Okay, guys.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.711
Police business. I gotta go.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.513
I'll show you to the door.

12:25.515 --> 12:28.473
All right, bye now. Take care.
Don't get shot.

12:29.555 --> 12:30.590
-Out.
-What?

12:30.675 --> 12:33.826
-Out. Now. Go.
-Come on, Steph.

12:34.355 --> 12:36.949
You can't fight it, baby.

12:38.955 --> 12:40.104
I'm cool.

12:40.875 --> 12:41.944
Don't even start.

12:42.035 --> 12:46.665
You need some handcuffs instead
of them stamps. Rick got them.

12:50.355 --> 12:53.472
Look, G, I'm filling you, man.
Stephanie's a dime.

12:53.675 --> 12:55.791
A dime? What's that mean?

12:55.995 --> 12:57.030
A ten.

12:58.435 --> 13:00.505
But she comes with carry-on.

13:00.915 --> 13:02.064
The kid.

13:03.435 --> 13:04.663
What's your point?

13:04.755 --> 13:08.543
It's like you're dating Janet,
but Janet's bringing Tito.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.154
You don't want that!

13:10.235 --> 13:13.864
We're just friends. I'm giving
her advice on her love life.

13:14.195 --> 13:18.985
Love life advice? She'd be better off
calling the Psychic Friends Network.

13:19.195 --> 13:22.392
If you want to get with that mommy,
you got to be a pappy.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.795
-Are you ready for that?
-No!

13:25.995 --> 13:28.953
I'm cool with my current
responsibilities, thank you.

13:29.155 --> 13:30.224
Like what?

13:30.915 --> 13:32.428
Remembering to floss.

13:33.235 --> 13:35.146
Feeding my fish.

13:36.155 --> 13:40.114
And, at some point,
returning The Matrix video to Blockbuster.

13:42.035 --> 13:45.186
A kid abandoned in a mailbox
should jump at the chance...

13:45.275 --> 13:48.506
-...to screw up a family of his own.
-You have to bring that up?

13:48.595 --> 13:51.632
Yeah, I have to bring that up, man!
What the--

13:53.235 --> 13:57.547
Didn't your foster parents teach you
to respect other people's property?

13:57.715 --> 14:01.344
The last time I sat on this couch,
my butt was orange for a week.

14:01.555 --> 14:05.673
Take your dang couch out of here.
I didn't want it in the first place.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.593
I don't have space for it.

14:07.675 --> 14:09.825
I'm teaching yoga in the front room.

14:10.195 --> 14:12.470
I don't want to hear
about you teaching yoga.

14:12.555 --> 14:14.546
You don't even know one yoga move.

14:14.635 --> 14:17.274
I can pick a $5 bill up with my butt.

14:17.515 --> 14:20.154
-You cannot.
-Give me $5.

14:21.275 --> 14:22.674
I want to see this.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.309
You're gonna see it, baby.
You're gonna see it.

14:25.395 --> 14:27.147
Watch this.

14:31.835 --> 14:32.904
Okay.

14:33.195 --> 14:34.548
All right, I'm stuck.

14:34.635 --> 14:37.388
-You all right?
-Just come push me over. Push me.

14:37.555 --> 14:40.467
Just push me. Just push me to the right.

14:42.235 --> 14:44.305
Hey, watch the couch, baby.

14:44.515 --> 14:46.107
All right, come on, man.

14:48.795 --> 14:51.707
-Yes, I'm gonna watch football.
-You know I'm ready!

14:53.155 --> 14:55.669
Yeah, I'm gonna watch some football!

14:58.355 --> 15:02.143
Miss Maguire, I have people here.
You must come down now.

15:02.595 --> 15:06.907
Miss Maguire, I have people here.
You must come down now.

15:08.235 --> 15:10.191
Hey, what are you yelling about?

15:10.355 --> 15:13.950
You tell her to come down now,
because we are leaving to the airport.

15:14.035 --> 15:15.229
She's so slow.

15:20.875 --> 15:23.150
-Where you going, man?
-Nowhere, man.

15:25.155 --> 15:27.430
Hey, man! Gordon!

15:27.635 --> 15:28.784
Do you mind?

15:28.995 --> 15:31.634
You can't take care
of the hamster I gave you.

15:31.835 --> 15:35.430
-What you gonna do with a woman?
-Come on, man, let me do this.

15:36.275 --> 15:38.231
Go handle your business then.

15:42.675 --> 15:43.744
What's up?

15:44.915 --> 15:47.668
I'm going away on business
and the babysitter's late.

15:47.755 --> 15:50.315
She said she'd be here in 10 minutes,
30 minutes ago.

15:50.395 --> 15:53.353
Okay, calm down. It's okay.
Super G's here.

15:55.675 --> 15:57.666
God, I hope this is you, Daisy.

15:58.115 --> 16:00.071
Hello? Daisy!

16:01.315 --> 16:05.627
You'll be here in 10 more minutes?
lf you don't get here, I'll miss my plane!

16:05.835 --> 16:08.190
I'll watch James until Daisy gets here.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.543
I don't think--

16:09.635 --> 16:11.353
Daisy! Yeah, it's Gordon.

16:11.475 --> 16:13.511
Get your butt over here, girl, fast!

16:13.595 --> 16:14.664
There you go.

16:14.755 --> 16:18.350
This isn't a good idea.
You don't know anything about children.

16:18.515 --> 16:21.234
It's 10 minutes.
What's he going to do, dry out?

16:21.315 --> 16:24.432
Come on, we'll kick back,
have a couple of beers, huh?

16:26.835 --> 16:28.553
Okay, one beer.

16:29.875 --> 16:33.663
You got business to take care of.
Just relax, it's gonna be fine.

16:34.395 --> 16:37.546
I'll keep an eye on James
and James'll keep an eye on me.

16:40.395 --> 16:44.024
Daisy is on her way, so Gordon's
gonna watch you for a few minutes.

16:44.355 --> 16:45.993
Are you okay with that?

16:50.035 --> 16:51.388
-Let's go!
-Okay, okay.

16:51.475 --> 16:53.705
Move it! Move it now!

16:57.675 --> 17:01.793
This is important. Remind Daisy
to always check the food pyramid.

17:01.995 --> 17:05.749
This is a list of what he can watch
and when, only an hour a day, no PG.

17:05.835 --> 17:07.553
No video games, all right?

17:07.755 --> 17:11.191
You've got to make sure that
she takes him to piano and soccer.

17:11.395 --> 17:13.351
Look, it's all in the schedule.

17:13.714 --> 17:16.512
All the shaded green areas
are all free playtime.

17:16.635 --> 17:20.310
Daisy knows all this, right?
She's been watching him for two years.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.113
Right. You're right. Okay.

17:22.194 --> 17:26.711
Mommy will be home tomorrow, and
when Mommy's away who do we listen to?

17:26.915 --> 17:29.304
-Daisy.
-Right. And remember, follow....

17:29.515 --> 17:32.075
"Follow the rules and playtime will follow."

17:32.275 --> 17:33.230
Got it.

17:33.675 --> 17:35.267
I love you.

17:35.475 --> 17:39.468
-Gordon, you're a lifesaver.
-Yeah, all five flavors.

17:40.155 --> 17:41.907
All people waiting for you!

17:43.355 --> 17:47.234
Don't make smoochie-smoochie.
Everybody, put on seat belts!

17:56.915 --> 17:59.634
All right, there it goes! Run, baby, run!

18:00.435 --> 18:02.187
Knock him on his ass!

18:03.915 --> 18:06.509
My bad. Knock him to the asphalt!

18:06.715 --> 18:08.467
Knock him to the asphalt!

18:09.115 --> 18:12.505
I hope the babysitter gets here soon
so we can go to the big screen.

18:12.595 --> 18:14.153
I know.

18:18.755 --> 18:22.589
Hello? Daisy, yeah, it's Gordon.
Where are you?

18:23.795 --> 18:25.706
What do you mean, you can't come?

18:25.795 --> 18:28.184
The game's on. Get your butt over here.

18:29.835 --> 18:31.063
Food poisoning?

18:34.675 --> 18:38.509
Daisy, listen, you can have
food poisoning over here...

18:38.675 --> 18:39.869
...with James.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.830
I don't understand what you're saying.

18:50.995 --> 18:52.747
I don't think she's coming.

18:53.795 --> 18:54.910
Don't worry.

18:54.995 --> 18:58.192
Your mom'll be back tomorrow,
and Benny will hang with us.

18:59.675 --> 19:01.506
You're hanging yourself fine.

19:02.995 --> 19:05.145
Remember, if he gets scared, cries...

19:05.235 --> 19:07.669
...or messes his drawers, give me a call.

19:08.235 --> 19:09.953
Benny, he's gonna be fine.

19:10.155 --> 19:12.874
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to him.

19:13.075 --> 19:16.590
James, if he goes to the bathroom
longer than five minutes...

19:16.755 --> 19:18.108
...light a match.

19:19.795 --> 19:23.788
I'll be watching the big screen!
You're on your own, dog!

19:24.075 --> 19:26.509
That ain't funny. Benny!

19:55.195 --> 19:56.389
I'm hungry.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.792
Good. Okay, food, I could do that.

20:01.595 --> 20:04.712
-Come on, kid.
-I can't have breakfast now.

20:05.595 --> 20:08.063
-Why not?
-It's dinnertime.

20:09.555 --> 20:10.544
So?

20:10.755 --> 20:12.393
I don't know about this.

20:26.555 --> 20:28.546
Doesn't your mommy make you clean?

20:28.635 --> 20:32.548
Occasionally, I take a flamethrower
to it and start all over again.

20:32.755 --> 20:34.154
What's that smell?

20:35.475 --> 20:37.193
That's the smell of a man.

20:38.035 --> 20:40.947
It's what a man's place smells like.

20:41.155 --> 20:42.986
But listen. Come over here.

20:43.475 --> 20:46.547
We gotta go over some rules here.
Listen carefully.

20:48.155 --> 20:50.305
This is my stuff.

20:51.395 --> 20:52.510
Look at it.

20:52.795 --> 20:56.913
It's beautiful. It's 500 watts
of Dolby Digital sound.

20:58.275 --> 21:01.824
Stereo, receiver, DVD player.
The tower of power!

21:02.435 --> 21:03.629
Check it out.

21:05.395 --> 21:06.589
Don't touch it.

21:06.875 --> 21:10.026
You hear that? Can you feel it, baby?

21:12.395 --> 21:15.990
-Say, "Don't touch Gordon's stuff."
-"Don't touch Gordon's stuff."

21:16.195 --> 21:18.550
We're gonna get along just fine.

21:19.715 --> 21:20.784
Here we go.

21:20.875 --> 21:24.754
Some natural whole-bran cereal,
just like the chart says...

21:24.955 --> 21:26.866
...and some soy milk.

21:33.355 --> 21:35.152
Hold it now, hold it now.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.466
Can't forget your prunes.

21:39.315 --> 21:41.875
All right, dig in.

21:48.835 --> 21:52.589
-Your mom ever say anything about me?
-I heard her with Daisy.

21:52.755 --> 21:57.545
Listening in to your mom's conversations?
That's good.

21:58.355 --> 22:01.028
-What'd she say?
-She said that you're funny.

22:01.235 --> 22:04.307
Funny? Funny, that's good.

22:04.515 --> 22:06.426
Yeah, we like funny.

22:07.155 --> 22:10.113
-What else?
-That you're irresponsible.

22:10.595 --> 22:12.108
Irresponsible?

22:12.275 --> 22:14.709
Irresponsible, waste your time...

22:14.915 --> 22:17.224
...and you only want one thing.

22:17.435 --> 22:20.268
Oh, and you're some kind of hound.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.348
She said that?

22:30.515 --> 22:32.471
What's she got you eating here?

22:49.555 --> 22:50.590
It's good.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.354
How can you eat that?

23:07.435 --> 23:10.188
"No sugar added"?
And they're proud of that?

23:12.795 --> 23:16.754
I want to tell you about this man I know.
His name's Cap'n Crunch.

23:17.235 --> 23:18.748
He's got some friends, too.

23:18.835 --> 23:22.430
Count Chocula and Toucan Sam.

23:25.075 --> 23:26.224
Froot Loops.

23:28.595 --> 23:30.233
I'm not allowed.

23:33.075 --> 23:36.954
Wait, wait. You see, the warden's away.

23:37.155 --> 23:41.831
Just us guys here. We hunt,
we gather, we eat what we want.

23:43.435 --> 23:45.073
What if my mom finds out?

23:45.755 --> 23:47.473
I won't tell if you don't.

23:58.835 --> 24:01.474
I see why it says
I shouldn't have given you sugar.

24:09.235 --> 24:10.873
Those are live animals!

24:12.235 --> 24:13.384
Catch me!

24:24.675 --> 24:26.950
I want this Agent 1 1 taken out.

24:28.595 --> 24:31.667
I don't know.
An FBI agent could be a little tricky.

24:34.475 --> 24:35.828
This guy is huge!

24:36.115 --> 24:40.267
Not him, you moron. The dog.
Agent 1 1 is a dog.

24:45.195 --> 24:49.234
That's funny. That's a good one, Sonny.
That's a good one.

24:49.475 --> 24:51.431
You want we should whack a dog?

24:52.835 --> 24:55.349
You two tubs of blubber think that's funny?

24:57.555 --> 25:00.513
-There's no reason to get personal.
-This is personal!

25:00.715 --> 25:04.708
It don't get no more personal!
I want the dog dead!

25:04.915 --> 25:06.587
All right, all right, Sonny.

25:06.675 --> 25:08.552
But, you know, we're pros.

25:08.755 --> 25:11.633
How we gonna hold our heads up
in the community...

25:11.835 --> 25:15.544
...with people knowing we're going
around to put the whack on a pooch?

25:15.635 --> 25:17.591
I mean, we got an image.

25:17.995 --> 25:21.067
If the two of you don't whack this pooch...

25:22.675 --> 25:24.552
...then you will get whacked.

25:25.955 --> 25:27.752
Okay. You're the boss.

25:27.955 --> 25:29.104
No problem.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.433
Do regular fees apply?

25:32.595 --> 25:34.153
-Come on.
-What'd I say?

25:35.555 --> 25:37.273
It is important that your dog...

25:37.355 --> 25:38.424
You see him?

25:38.515 --> 25:39.743
...know work ethic.

25:39.835 --> 25:41.587
It's a bunch of puppies.

25:42.235 --> 25:44.430
But he also wants to please you.

25:44.595 --> 25:48.747
Teach him to work, to work well,
and in the end that is all he will want.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.273
-Michaels, what are you doing?
-Nothing, sir.

25:52.475 --> 25:54.033
Is Agent 44 your pet?

25:54.115 --> 25:55.434
-No, sir.
-He's not.

25:55.515 --> 25:57.392
-He's an FBI agent.
-Yes, sir.

25:57.755 --> 26:01.225
-You wouldn't tickle an agent's belly.
-No, sir.

26:01.475 --> 26:06.026
You don't see me tickling
Agent Cassavettes' underbelly, do you?

26:06.235 --> 26:07.350
No, you do not!

26:07.435 --> 26:10.154
Get this through your head!
This is not a drill!

26:10.395 --> 26:15.105
These dogs will save your life.
Agent 1 1 saved mine several times.

26:15.315 --> 26:17.226
So don't tickle my animals.

26:17.435 --> 26:20.666
All canine agents wear
an lnvisible Fence collar...

26:20.875 --> 26:23.787
...which gives a shock designed
to get his attention.

26:24.275 --> 26:26.869
Since we work exclusively
with hand signals...

26:26.955 --> 26:30.664
...sometimes it is necessary
to prompt the dog to look back.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.752
This causes serious discomfort.

26:32.835 --> 26:34.188
For the dog's safety...

26:34.275 --> 26:37.745
...the collar has a voltage regulator
to prevent power surges.

26:37.955 --> 26:42.312
Never introduce a metal object
or you'll light your animal up.

26:43.795 --> 26:48.425
A demonstration of the collar by
the most decorated canine in FBI history.

26:49.235 --> 26:50.827
-That's him!
-You sure?

26:51.155 --> 26:55.785
Oh, yeah. Yeah, a little older maybe,
but that's him.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.104
Attack!

26:58.235 --> 26:59.953
Come to Papa. Now!

27:04.315 --> 27:07.307
-You said, "Now."
-I meant now "now," not "now"!

27:09.955 --> 27:13.743
Word on the street is Sonny Talia
put the hit out on Agent 1 1 .

27:13.955 --> 27:15.786
Not that we're surprised.

27:15.955 --> 27:20.631
If Talia can infiltrate our training facility,
Agent 1 1 isn't safe here.

27:23.315 --> 27:26.193
I've decided to call Witness Protection
in on this.

27:26.835 --> 27:29.588
Agent Murdoch, Agent Sharp.

27:30.155 --> 27:33.545
-This is a highly unusual--
-Agent Sharp, Agent 1 1 .

27:43.315 --> 27:46.830
This is a highly unusual request.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.548
But the agency is very concerned.

27:51.755 --> 27:56.067
To be able to do something like this,
Talia must have a man on the inside....

27:59.635 --> 28:04.425
Until we learn who that is,
we will be relocating Agent 1 1 ...

28:04.635 --> 28:06.432
...to a protected environment.

28:06.515 --> 28:09.985
-Okay, so where will we be going?
-Not "we."

28:10.195 --> 28:11.833
Agent 1 1 is going alone.

28:12.435 --> 28:16.587
-So you're taking him away from me?
-Let it go. It's for his own good.

28:16.755 --> 28:19.747
But we're a team.
Agent 1 1 is my most important tool.

28:20.275 --> 28:22.789
What would I be without him?
Nothing at all!

28:22.875 --> 28:26.345
You can't take him away from me!
That's like taking away my gun!

28:33.475 --> 28:34.908
That'll be fine.

29:12.115 --> 29:13.548
Hey, little buddy.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.025
Little hair of the dog that bit you.

29:24.595 --> 29:26.472
I feel better.

29:37.555 --> 29:41.309
-Where's your school?
-I don't have school. It's summer.

29:41.555 --> 29:43.307
Guess I'll take you to my work.

29:43.395 --> 29:46.148
I get to deliver the mail!

29:46.355 --> 29:47.151
Great.

29:51.195 --> 29:53.709
At least tell me where he's going.

29:54.675 --> 29:56.552
There's no harm in that, I guess.

29:56.635 --> 30:00.753
He's going to an FBI sled dog
training facility in Alaska.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.313
Watch yourself up there.

30:08.195 --> 30:09.230
Okay, boy?

30:10.835 --> 30:12.154
Come on, get in.

30:20.595 --> 30:21.789
I'll take those.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.548
Don't worry, Murdoch, okay? He'll be fine.

30:24.755 --> 30:26.825
Yeah, he better be.

30:41.675 --> 30:43.154
Message from Sonny:

30:45.235 --> 30:46.953
"Play dead."

30:50.795 --> 30:53.229
The dog is in the third van.

31:10.075 --> 31:12.828
Remember, you're not supposed to be
in the truck.

31:13.235 --> 31:15.066
It's against regulations.

31:15.275 --> 31:18.108
So just stay low and make yourself useful.

31:18.315 --> 31:21.352
Divide those stacks of letters
into odd and even numbers.

31:21.435 --> 31:23.426
-Okay.
-Thanks, pal.

31:32.435 --> 31:33.663
Pull alongside.

31:33.795 --> 31:35.865
I'll whack the driver, then the dog.

31:35.955 --> 31:37.707
Gotcha. Whoa!

31:39.155 --> 31:40.747
When it's safe.

31:43.315 --> 31:44.714
Ease up alongside.

31:54.235 --> 31:55.634
Get the dog!

31:55.795 --> 31:57.069
Drive the car!

32:00.955 --> 32:03.025
Hey, buddy, I'll be right back.

32:03.235 --> 32:04.827
Don't go anywhere.

32:26.995 --> 32:27.950
Hi.

32:42.515 --> 32:44.028
How you doing back there?

32:44.115 --> 32:46.026
Gordon, is this your dog?

32:46.835 --> 32:48.314
No, that's your dog.

32:49.275 --> 32:50.594
Mine?

32:50.795 --> 32:53.025
Yeah, I gave him to you, remember?

32:53.235 --> 32:55.590
Cool. What's his name?

32:56.755 --> 32:59.189
Spot. The dog's name's Spot.

32:59.795 --> 33:01.547
Spot?

33:04.475 --> 33:07.467
Yo, Cleavis! What's up, brother?

33:20.755 --> 33:22.188
Oh, man!

33:23.675 --> 33:24.869
James!

33:25.075 --> 33:26.667
James!

33:29.155 --> 33:30.508
James, come here.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.426
You okay? Any broken bones?

33:34.515 --> 33:35.743
-I'm fine.
-Good!

33:35.835 --> 33:37.985
-Whose dog is that?
-That's my dog.

33:38.475 --> 33:39.464
Your dog?

33:39.675 --> 33:41.506
-Don't lie to me!
-I'm not.

33:41.715 --> 33:44.024
It's my dog, Spot. You gave him to me.

33:48.915 --> 33:51.031
I did not give you a dog.

33:54.435 --> 33:55.584
What?

33:56.075 --> 33:57.667
Hey, Stephanie.

33:57.875 --> 34:00.184
I've been leaving you messages all night.

34:00.275 --> 34:01.833
I know. Is James okay?

34:01.915 --> 34:04.429
Yeah, the kid's fine. Everything's cool.

34:04.755 --> 34:08.225
I can't believe this. I shouldn't
have left him. I have to get back.

34:08.315 --> 34:09.987
So you'll be here in two hours?

34:10.074 --> 34:11.393
No, I'm not.

34:11.594 --> 34:13.630
There's been some freak blizzard.

34:13.715 --> 34:15.592
The flights are canceled...

34:15.795 --> 34:18.263
...roads are closed,
even cell phones don't work.

34:18.355 --> 34:19.947
People are going insane.

34:20.915 --> 34:22.348
Everyone, back off!

34:23.795 --> 34:25.864
I don't think you can handle this.

34:25.955 --> 34:28.025
I'm coming. Somehow, I'm coming.

34:28.195 --> 34:31.152
What do you mean I can't handle
something like this?

34:31.315 --> 34:33.783
You think I'm irresponsible.

34:33.995 --> 34:38.034
Well, for your information,
I'm a very responsible guy.

34:38.235 --> 34:41.545
I'm going to call Beverly
and see if she can take James.

34:41.835 --> 34:45.190
Well, go ahead and do that.
That's probably a good idea.

34:45.395 --> 34:47.511
But if you need me, I'm here.

34:50.275 --> 34:52.106
Can I talk to James, please?

34:52.875 --> 34:55.594
Yeah, sure. Hold on.

34:57.315 --> 34:58.828
Listen...

34:58.915 --> 35:01.190
...don't tell her about this. It's guy stuff.

35:01.275 --> 35:03.152
Don't mention the accident...

35:03.475 --> 35:06.194
...and don't say anything about the D-O-G.

35:08.835 --> 35:12.032
Hi, Mom. Gordon got me a dog.

35:12.915 --> 35:15.110
I know, I saw him before I left.

35:15.315 --> 35:17.306
His name is Spot. Can I keep him?

35:17.395 --> 35:19.147
Yeah, you sure can.

35:19.315 --> 35:20.873
Wow! Thanks, Mom!

35:35.155 --> 35:37.589
I wonder, is Agent 1 1 all right up there?

35:37.795 --> 35:41.708
We've never been apart.
I feel like a part of me is missing.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.073
Cassavettes.

35:47.995 --> 35:51.032
What do you mean,
he jumped out of the van? Which van?

35:55.955 --> 35:58.025
No problem. That wasn't our dog.

35:58.195 --> 36:01.153
That was a decoy.
Let the local dogcatcher handle it.

36:02.515 --> 36:03.789
Check on him.

36:04.475 --> 36:06.989
Murdoch, he's fine. It wasn't him.

36:18.715 --> 36:20.546
FBI substation, Nome.

36:20.755 --> 36:21.790
Danvers...

36:21.875 --> 36:23.388
...this is the Tiger.

36:23.475 --> 36:25.306
Hi, Murdoch. How you doing?

36:26.355 --> 36:30.143
Don't use my real name, man.
I don't know if this line is secure.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.470
Sorry.

36:31.635 --> 36:33.034
What's up, Tigger?

36:33.115 --> 36:36.266
It's Tiger, and has the package arrived?

36:36.435 --> 36:38.107
He's here, yeah.

36:38.315 --> 36:41.944
Are you sure this is an FBI dog?
He doesn't look like much.

36:42.155 --> 36:45.147
Listen, 1 1 is the top canine agent
in America...

36:45.355 --> 36:48.153
...and probably the world. He is a killer.

36:48.435 --> 36:49.868
Okay.

37:00.595 --> 37:02.984
That didn't impress you all? Okay.

37:03.395 --> 37:04.874
Yeah! Look at that!

37:05.075 --> 37:06.190
What?

37:09.555 --> 37:12.911
See? You're in trouble now.
There comes my boy right there.

37:14.115 --> 37:16.106
My boy's always got my back.

37:16.315 --> 37:18.226
Hold on right there. Hold on!

37:19.315 --> 37:22.512
-Benny, what's going down?
-Just on my 15-minute break.

37:22.715 --> 37:25.309
-But I don't back down.
-They calling you out?

37:25.395 --> 37:27.784
-You got my back?
-Let's get disgruntled.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.710
Okay. I'll give you that.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.065
I give you that. What else you got?

37:51.195 --> 37:53.834
Little something I call
"The George Jefferson."

37:57.155 --> 37:58.873
Yeah, that's it!

37:59.075 --> 38:01.953
-Call Weezie!
-Weezie!

38:03.995 --> 38:05.826
Put the mail in the box!

38:06.035 --> 38:08.265
E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial.

38:10.075 --> 38:12.111
-Make him phone home!
-Phone home.

38:12.315 --> 38:15.034
-Make him phone home!
-Phone home!

38:17.795 --> 38:19.626
There you go! Break it down!

38:24.035 --> 38:26.310
Grab them! Get dizzy on them!

38:28.795 --> 38:32.470
-Don't get dizzy, make them dizzy!
-Air Gordon, baby!

38:35.515 --> 38:38.188
You know what?
This is how I shut the club down.

38:38.395 --> 38:40.226
Yeah, you want some of this?

38:48.315 --> 38:51.307
You see the expression on that dog's face?

38:51.595 --> 38:54.348
It wasn't a scowl.
It was more like a smirk.

38:54.555 --> 38:56.625
It was like he was smirking at us.

38:56.755 --> 39:00.589
Yeah, well, I can't even believe that
I'm doing this.

39:02.595 --> 39:03.584
What?

39:03.795 --> 39:05.467
Give me the good news.

39:07.515 --> 39:10.587
Listen, that skirt
from the Witness Protection Program...

39:10.675 --> 39:13.235
...she gave us some bad information.

39:13.395 --> 39:15.625
So we kind of...

39:15.795 --> 39:17.467
...followed the wrong dog.

39:17.555 --> 39:20.592
But don't worry,
because we got it all figured out.

39:20.795 --> 39:24.754
We know where her mistake was.
We'll have the dog by the morning.

39:25.395 --> 39:26.874
I know you all my life.

39:26.955 --> 39:28.866
We grew up on the same block.

39:29.075 --> 39:31.031
Your mother changed my diapers.

39:31.155 --> 39:33.464
Your sister's married to my goombah...

39:33.675 --> 39:37.384
...and I'll personally shove you
headfirst into an incinerator...

39:37.595 --> 39:39.631
...and burn you to a crisp...

39:39.835 --> 39:41.473
...if you screw this up!

39:42.195 --> 39:45.824
This is good. You ought to have some
of this with the tomato.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.469
Oh, boy. If this ever gets out....

39:48.675 --> 39:51.633
Hey, you didn't say nothing to nobody,
did you?

39:51.795 --> 39:53.069
No!

39:53.275 --> 39:54.708
Well, I told Paulie.

39:54.795 --> 39:56.865
You told Paulie?

39:57.115 --> 39:58.468
He's a gossip.

39:58.675 --> 40:01.314
I had to. I was supposed
to do that thing in Atlanta.

40:01.395 --> 40:04.353
-He promised he'll keep his mouth shut.
-Yeah, right.

40:04.595 --> 40:06.313
Let's go to the dog pound.

40:06.515 --> 40:07.470
Big mouth!

40:07.555 --> 40:09.034
Nobody will know nothing.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.867
Charlie the Clip from Jersey.

40:10.955 --> 40:12.434
-Gino--
-Shut up!

40:12.595 --> 40:15.826
Vinny Bash from Brooklyn. Eddie Sharp.

40:16.035 --> 40:18.833
Oh, Joey BB Eyes!

40:20.595 --> 40:22.108
I don't want to leave him here.

40:22.195 --> 40:24.026
You don't want a dog. Trust me.

40:24.115 --> 40:25.867
I want Spot.

40:26.035 --> 40:27.866
This dog isn't Spot, it....

40:28.075 --> 40:30.509
This dog doesn't even
have one spot on him.

40:30.795 --> 40:33.389
Doesn't matter. It's just a name.

40:33.555 --> 40:35.466
Come on. You don't want a dog.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.150
Dogs stink!

40:39.355 --> 40:41.664
You gotta feed and walk and clean them.

40:41.795 --> 40:44.184
They poop everywhere. Even in your bed.

40:45.675 --> 40:48.951
James, I'm a mailman. Mailmen hate dogs.

40:51.955 --> 40:54.515
I won't have a dog in my house. I'm sorry.

40:54.715 --> 40:56.194
It'll never happen.

40:56.395 --> 40:58.306
What will happen to him?

41:19.115 --> 41:21.549
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.234
The dog's weird.

41:35.155 --> 41:37.908
Know what, dog?
You're giving me the creeps.

41:39.195 --> 41:41.265
What's wrong with him?

41:41.795 --> 41:42.830
I got it!

41:43.675 --> 41:45.711
We'll play catch, okay?

41:45.875 --> 41:47.354
Okay, catch the ball.

41:51.795 --> 41:53.308
Let's try that again.

41:54.355 --> 41:56.107
Watch the ball.

41:59.195 --> 42:00.548
Are you serious?

42:02.035 --> 42:04.595
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you play?

42:05.795 --> 42:07.945
No play.

42:08.155 --> 42:09.110
No.

42:09.315 --> 42:11.351
Do you hear me, Agent 1 1? No.

42:11.555 --> 42:14.592
Bad agent. We don't do that. No.

42:14.795 --> 42:15.944
Hello!

42:16.115 --> 42:18.310
Is anybody home?

42:18.755 --> 42:19.824
Okay, look...

42:19.915 --> 42:22.827
...l'm gonna do
what you're supposed to do.

42:23.035 --> 42:25.390
Check it out. I'll take your collar...

42:25.875 --> 42:27.945
...and I'm gonna be a dog.

42:28.715 --> 42:31.309
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna be you.

42:31.515 --> 42:33.790
A big, stupid dog.

42:35.075 --> 42:36.110
Look.

42:36.315 --> 42:37.668
I can sit.

42:38.275 --> 42:39.708
I can lay down.

42:47.595 --> 42:50.632
Well, I can't scratch my head,
but Benny probably could.

42:50.715 --> 42:52.114
I can lick my...

42:53.435 --> 42:54.504
...paw.

42:55.595 --> 42:57.551
Watch me, I can chase my tail.

42:57.755 --> 42:59.313
I'm chasing my tail.

43:01.355 --> 43:03.505
He's so weird.

43:05.635 --> 43:07.034
Oh, God.

43:09.475 --> 43:11.705
I don't know what to tell you, James.

43:11.915 --> 43:13.871
You're not trying hard enough.

43:14.075 --> 43:15.474
Are you kidding?

43:15.755 --> 43:17.188
I mean, come on...

43:17.395 --> 43:19.272
...the dog doesn't want to play.

43:19.355 --> 43:20.583
Dog's broken.

43:20.675 --> 43:22.313
You didn't try hard enough.

43:22.395 --> 43:23.794
I'm about to throw up!

43:23.875 --> 43:25.547
I didn't try hard enough.

43:25.675 --> 43:28.030
It's not my fault this dog is broke!

43:28.235 --> 43:30.271
Maybe when your mom gets back...

43:30.475 --> 43:33.035
...she can get you a dog
that actually works!

43:33.235 --> 43:35.385
Why don't you watch TV or something?

43:35.595 --> 43:38.632
Keep it on cartoons.
Don't try to get smart.

43:41.675 --> 43:44.394
Thank you.
Now quietly entertain yourself.

43:44.555 --> 43:45.908
Yeah, this'll do.

43:48.915 --> 43:51.907
Look, Brain! I made a round bird.

43:52.115 --> 43:54.549
Gotta get this stupid dog collar
off my neck!

43:54.635 --> 43:57.707
Birdy, birdy, birdy! Narf!

44:27.475 --> 44:28.590
No!

44:33.035 --> 44:34.673
James, put that down!

44:35.315 --> 44:37.067
James, put that down.

44:37.235 --> 44:38.827
Say we'll keep Spot.

44:39.035 --> 44:40.548
We can't. He's not--

44:41.275 --> 44:44.073
Okay, okay! You can keep the dog.

44:50.675 --> 44:52.506
Here we go! You ready?

44:53.235 --> 44:54.827
Go get it, girl!

44:56.635 --> 44:58.353
Hey, there.

44:58.515 --> 44:59.743
That's him.

45:05.795 --> 45:07.308
Wrong dog.

45:11.315 --> 45:13.146
Do you mind?

45:13.475 --> 45:16.114
I gotta take these two creatures
to the park...

45:16.235 --> 45:18.703
...and I don't need you giving me attitude.

45:19.515 --> 45:21.312
Don't you all look adorable?

45:21.395 --> 45:24.592
Look, you got a kid,
you got the dog, you got you.

45:24.795 --> 45:27.263
Norman Rockwell, man.
Let me get a picture.

45:27.395 --> 45:28.589
Say "Tupac! "

45:28.955 --> 45:30.183
"Tupac! "

45:32.755 --> 45:35.315
You see that, dog? He said, "Tupac."

45:38.035 --> 45:41.027
I feel like such a proud mama right now.

45:41.355 --> 45:42.629
Look...

45:43.435 --> 45:44.709
...my family.

45:44.915 --> 45:47.224
All right, you want to come to the park?

45:47.315 --> 45:49.067
Park? For what, man?

45:49.235 --> 45:52.113
To watch you watch the dog?
The dog don't move!

45:52.275 --> 45:55.187
He ain't moved since I walked in!
Look at him!

45:56.155 --> 45:57.747
-I think he broke.
-Yeah.

45:57.835 --> 46:00.952
Get Spot's ball, we'll get the Frisbee.
Meet in the hall.

46:02.875 --> 46:04.228
Go get it, Spot!

46:04.435 --> 46:05.550
Go get it.

46:13.235 --> 46:14.748
Maybe the Frisbee will work.

46:14.835 --> 46:16.826
Come on, go get the Frisbee.

46:17.875 --> 46:19.467
What's wrong with you?

46:28.275 --> 46:29.628
You see anything?

46:30.315 --> 46:32.271
Just keep your eyes peeled.

46:32.475 --> 46:34.511
Where does a mutt go?

46:43.155 --> 46:44.190
Take it easy.

46:44.275 --> 46:47.108
He has a bladder condition.
He can't control himself.

46:47.195 --> 46:49.550
I got your bladder condition over here.

46:49.755 --> 46:51.393
Take it easy. Come on.

46:51.635 --> 46:54.103
Get your mutt out of here! Take a hike!

46:54.595 --> 46:56.586
Jeez, it stinks, Gino.

46:56.755 --> 46:58.313
You think it'll stain?

47:02.755 --> 47:04.586
Hey, help!

47:05.035 --> 47:06.866
He stole her purse!

47:08.155 --> 47:09.110
Help!

47:09.715 --> 47:10.830
There he is.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.384
-Spot!
-James, come here!

47:13.675 --> 47:16.269
Spot, come back!

47:36.155 --> 47:38.988
Sorry, man. That dog is totally psycho.

47:43.635 --> 47:45.273
Where's that crazy dog?

47:45.395 --> 47:46.953
There he is.

47:48.155 --> 47:49.986
Spot, no!

47:50.195 --> 47:52.106
Bad dog! What are you doing?

47:52.315 --> 47:55.944
I'm sorry. He's not really my dog.
I didn't know he was a thief!

47:56.715 --> 47:57.670
What?

48:01.555 --> 48:02.829
What's that?

48:03.035 --> 48:04.866
Listen, I said I'm sorry.

48:05.075 --> 48:08.112
Oh, I get it. How much you want? $20?

48:08.275 --> 48:09.674
$25.

48:09.755 --> 48:12.349
Come on, that purse ain't worth
more than that.

48:12.435 --> 48:13.709
I said I'm sorry.

48:13.795 --> 48:16.184
Hey, back off. What's the matter, lady?

48:30.235 --> 48:31.987
Gordon, it's me again.

48:32.835 --> 48:34.871
I can't believe it. This is terrible.

48:34.955 --> 48:37.913
I made it out of the snow,
but all the roads are blocked.

48:37.995 --> 48:42.193
The stupid bus is stuck.
I don't know how I'll get back.

48:42.915 --> 48:45.952
You really don't know
how much I appreciate this.

48:46.155 --> 48:48.350
You're a good man, Gordon.

48:48.555 --> 48:50.352
Hey, Gordon?

48:50.515 --> 48:53.791
You know what? I really hate asking this...

48:53.995 --> 48:58.227
...but the thing is, James has
this little trouble sleeping....

49:20.635 --> 49:22.193
I gotta go.

49:27.315 --> 49:28.543
What's wrong?

49:29.435 --> 49:30.993
I can't take it anymore!

49:31.075 --> 49:34.351
I can't sleep! I can't eat!
I'm an emotional wreck!

49:34.555 --> 49:35.988
It's all right.

49:36.715 --> 49:38.433
You're here now.

49:39.315 --> 49:41.067
Cassavettes...

49:42.915 --> 49:45.383
...l don't know how to tell you this.

49:46.275 --> 49:50.109
-Are you wearing 1 1's dog tag?
-He's feeling what I'm feeling.

49:50.315 --> 49:52.226
I talked to Danvers.

49:52.435 --> 49:55.074
He's only had one cup of kibbles today.

49:55.275 --> 49:58.028
The dog? You came here
to talk about the dog?

49:58.195 --> 50:00.629
Of course! He's my partner! I miss him!

50:00.755 --> 50:02.791
We've never been apart this long.

50:02.995 --> 50:07.352
He's always been a good eater,
just like me, even when he was a puppy.

50:09.675 --> 50:11.313
This is not healthy.

50:11.475 --> 50:13.306
I want you to fly up there...

50:13.515 --> 50:16.473
...check on him,
and get this out of your system.

50:17.715 --> 50:18.864
Really?

50:19.475 --> 50:22.672
There you go.
You do the crime, you do the time.

50:25.355 --> 50:28.586
I told you he wouldn't like that.

50:29.195 --> 50:30.674
Of course he likes that.

50:30.755 --> 50:32.347
That's what that sound means.

50:32.435 --> 50:33.584
Yeah, right.

50:35.315 --> 50:37.112
Come on, it's bedtime.

50:39.955 --> 50:42.025
Just holler if you need anything.

50:52.075 --> 50:53.872
Good night, Spot.

51:08.435 --> 51:10.187
Are you kidding?

51:14.355 --> 51:16.107
Stupid dog!

51:17.155 --> 51:18.793
What's the racket about?

51:21.875 --> 51:23.752
Okay, I get it.

51:25.715 --> 51:27.592
I'm glad you can sleep.

51:31.315 --> 51:33.670
Wait, my keys.

51:38.555 --> 51:39.908
Let's go, stupid.

51:52.875 --> 51:54.354
Come on, go already.

51:57.395 --> 51:58.669
What now?

52:04.435 --> 52:07.108
That's nasty. I'm not picking that up.

52:28.675 --> 52:30.154
What's the big idea?

52:30.515 --> 52:33.552
All right, I'm sorry
I tied you to the furnace.

52:34.275 --> 52:35.549
Let me in.

52:35.755 --> 52:37.746
All right. Where you going?

52:38.155 --> 52:39.304
Come back here!

52:39.395 --> 52:43.388
Where are you going? You stupid dog.

53:06.355 --> 53:09.028
Oh, God. Nasty.

53:15.235 --> 53:16.714
God!

53:30.795 --> 53:32.513
Shut up down there!

53:32.715 --> 53:35.309
I'm covered in caca!

53:35.475 --> 53:36.749
God.

53:38.635 --> 53:40.830
Oh, God.

54:10.075 --> 54:13.067
Spot. I'm gonna kill you.

54:32.115 --> 54:33.070
Come on.

55:06.075 --> 55:07.269
Got some ID?

55:07.635 --> 55:08.750
ID?

55:08.955 --> 55:10.274
I don't think so.

55:10.355 --> 55:12.027
Don't get wise, buddy.

55:12.235 --> 55:15.432
Listen, I live right here.
The dog locked me out.

55:15.955 --> 55:17.104
You been drinking?

55:17.195 --> 55:19.470
No, I have not been drinking!

55:19.635 --> 55:21.944
I'm taking care of the neighbor's kid...

55:22.035 --> 55:23.388
...then this dog came!

55:23.475 --> 55:24.828
Came from where?

55:24.915 --> 55:26.189
Hell.

55:26.355 --> 55:30.985
This is Satan's dog. I'm telling you!
He gets mad at the drop of a hat!

55:31.155 --> 55:34.943
He got pissed off and locked me
out of my own house! He's crazy!

55:35.235 --> 55:38.193
Put your hands on your head!

55:41.435 --> 55:44.268
Okay, let's just try to relax here.

55:44.475 --> 55:46.033
He locked me out of my house.

55:46.115 --> 55:48.470
Satan's dog locked you out?

55:48.675 --> 55:49.869
Yeah.

55:50.075 --> 55:52.111
You think I'd do this to myself?.

55:53.315 --> 55:56.193
Come with us.
We'll get someone who can help you.

55:56.595 --> 55:58.313
Not in my car. He reeks.

56:00.635 --> 56:03.911
Oh, thank God! James!
See, that's the kid!

56:05.355 --> 56:06.788
And that's the dog!

56:07.115 --> 56:08.548
Son, do you know him?

56:08.635 --> 56:11.149
That's Gordon. He lives here.

56:12.515 --> 56:16.110
Next time you step outside, sir,
I suggest you take your keys.

56:16.275 --> 56:18.027
Thanks, I'll remember that.

56:21.275 --> 56:23.550
Let me in the house!

56:29.795 --> 56:32.946
This is crazy, Gino.
Sonny will nail our heads together.

56:33.155 --> 56:36.067
I say we get our passports,
start to learn Spanish.

56:36.275 --> 56:37.788
Arliss...

56:37.995 --> 56:39.713
...you gotta focus.

56:39.915 --> 56:42.349
All we gotta do is get in the dog's head.

56:42.675 --> 56:45.348
So every place a dog has gotta go...

56:45.435 --> 56:46.993
...we hang the posters.

56:47.075 --> 56:49.191
Sooner or later he's gotta show.

56:49.755 --> 56:52.428
And when he does, bada-bing.

56:52.635 --> 56:53.590
That's smart.

57:04.355 --> 57:05.788
What are you doing?

57:07.035 --> 57:09.754
You're doing it all wrong.
Come on, check it out.

57:09.835 --> 57:13.874
You gotta put a bunch of junk on it.
Let me give you some style.

57:14.315 --> 57:15.464
Here you go.

57:15.795 --> 57:18.832
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, get crazy.

57:19.035 --> 57:20.753
Girls love that.

57:20.915 --> 57:22.348
That's the look.

57:22.515 --> 57:23.470
Yeah.

57:24.115 --> 57:26.106
See? That's got attitude.

57:29.595 --> 57:32.063
Gordon, what was your daddy like?

57:33.075 --> 57:34.190
My daddy?

57:35.235 --> 57:37.988
Well, I'm just like you.
I don't have a daddy.

57:38.195 --> 57:39.753
What about your mommy?

57:39.955 --> 57:43.630
-Well, I didn't have a mommy either.
-You didn't have a mommy?

57:44.635 --> 57:46.193
Hey, man, it's cool.

57:46.395 --> 57:47.908
I mean, look at Spot.

57:48.275 --> 57:50.266
Spot doesn't have a mommy or daddy.

57:50.355 --> 57:53.074
He's a stray, but he's happy.

57:53.275 --> 57:56.028
I mean, he's a little screwed up,
but he's happy.

57:56.755 --> 57:59.189
I'm sorry you didn't have
a mommy, Gordon.

58:00.675 --> 58:02.347
I didn't need a mommy.

58:03.515 --> 58:06.666
If I did have one,
she'd probably comb my hair like this.

58:06.795 --> 58:08.592
Make me look foolish.

58:11.435 --> 58:13.073
Mush! Come on!

58:23.795 --> 58:25.865
Tigger, you made it.

58:26.315 --> 58:28.670
It's Tiger, you moron!

58:28.875 --> 58:32.106
You seem awfully happy to be here.

58:32.995 --> 58:35.463
This is not a smile.

58:35.635 --> 58:38.354
My face is frozen like this!

58:38.515 --> 58:39.994
Now, how's Agent 1 1?

58:44.035 --> 58:45.468
That's not Agent 1 1 !

58:45.675 --> 58:47.791
Well, that's the dog they sent us.

58:50.555 --> 58:54.833
-Cassavettes.
-The dog that jumped out was Agent 1 1 .

58:54.995 --> 58:56.906
The tags were switched!

58:57.115 --> 58:58.707
-Are you sure?
-I'm positive.

58:58.795 --> 59:00.751
It had to be Sharp.

59:07.435 --> 59:08.754
Forget it.

59:09.115 --> 59:10.833
She's long gone.

59:11.475 --> 59:14.035
Okay, Spot, let's try it again.

59:25.435 --> 59:27.995
Listen up, Spot. I got no time for you.

59:28.195 --> 59:30.345
And I know you don't like me either.

59:31.315 --> 59:33.783
You're your own dog.
You like to hang back.

59:33.875 --> 59:35.433
I'm down with that.

59:36.475 --> 59:38.625
But I'm here to talk about the kid.

59:38.835 --> 59:41.144
See, his mom keeps him on a short leash.

59:41.235 --> 59:42.907
You hear what I'm saying?

59:43.035 --> 59:45.265
I'd like to see the kid have some fun.

59:47.315 --> 59:50.432
Let's go, Spot. Let's hook
the kid up with some fun.

59:50.835 --> 59:52.905
Let's go! Let's go have some fun!

59:53.155 --> 59:55.146
Come on, let's go have some fun!

59:58.515 --> 01:00:00.267
I'm sorry, James.

01:00:04.675 --> 01:00:06.074
Let's just go.

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:16.068
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Come on.

01:00:23.475 --> 01:00:24.828
What's he doing?

01:00:25.315 --> 01:00:27.783
I don't know.
Why don't you try throwing it?

01:00:33.075 --> 01:00:34.303
How about that?

01:00:36.835 --> 01:00:38.871
Good boy, good boy.

01:00:40.475 --> 01:00:41.954
Here, come on, Spot.

01:00:53.395 --> 01:00:54.748
Come on, jump up.

01:00:54.995 --> 01:00:56.508
Come on, Spot. Good boy.

01:00:56.595 --> 01:00:59.632
-Did you see how high he jumped?
-Yeah, like five feet.

01:00:59.795 --> 01:01:01.148
Our boy can play!

01:01:01.515 --> 01:01:05.269
-He isn't retarded.
-No, he's a smart dog.

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.072
Thanks, Spot. I owe you one.

01:01:08.755 --> 01:01:12.430
What do you say we get him a bone
or a snack or whatever dogs eat?

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:21.068
Get out of here!

01:01:23.315 --> 01:01:25.545
-You believe these kids?
-No respect.

01:01:30.075 --> 01:01:31.349
That's our mutt!

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:33.707
-That's our mutt!
-Let's go.

01:01:37.835 --> 01:01:39.791
All right, you go get the dog...

01:01:39.955 --> 01:01:44.233
...one of those.... Whatever he wants.
I'm gonna ask this lady a question.

01:01:45.075 --> 01:01:47.191
Hey, how's it going?

01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:51.354
Starchild?

01:01:52.555 --> 01:01:54.466
"Starchild." Are you serious?

01:01:57.795 --> 01:02:00.309
You can have anything you want, Spot.

01:02:00.515 --> 01:02:01.994
What about this one?

01:02:02.355 --> 01:02:03.470
No.

01:02:03.675 --> 01:02:04.710
Hello.

01:02:05.275 --> 01:02:06.833
Cat got your tongue?

01:02:21.075 --> 01:02:22.906
Now, where did this mutt go?

01:02:24.915 --> 01:02:27.713
Hey, kid! Where's that dog?

01:02:43.395 --> 01:02:45.909
Be careful. There's piranha in there.

01:02:46.155 --> 01:02:47.588
You get the guns.

01:02:54.355 --> 01:02:56.266
Let's get that mutt.

01:02:58.355 --> 01:03:00.915
No! I'm not paying for this!

01:03:22.355 --> 01:03:23.754
Spot, are you okay?

01:03:26.795 --> 01:03:28.831
"Can cause paralysis"?

01:03:31.715 --> 01:03:33.273
I'll go the other way.

01:03:43.475 --> 01:03:45.033
Get this thing off me!

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.474
Help!

01:04:09.635 --> 01:04:10.954
Hey, kid.

01:04:11.155 --> 01:04:12.349
How you doing?

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:15.224
Want to help your Uncle Gino
find the doggy?

01:04:15.315 --> 01:04:16.430
Hey!

01:04:25.715 --> 01:04:27.592
Whoa. Help!

01:04:28.275 --> 01:04:29.390
Help!

01:05:07.475 --> 01:05:08.749
You go that way.

01:05:08.835 --> 01:05:10.553
That's it. It's over.

01:05:13.315 --> 01:05:14.953
My legs!

01:05:37.151 --> 01:05:39.870
Gordon? It's me again.

01:05:40.071 --> 01:05:41.948
I'm just calling to check in.

01:05:42.151 --> 01:05:44.665
Are you there? I'm sure everything's fine.

01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:47.305
If you want to, call me on my cell phone.

01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:49.501
Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:03.986
Stop!

01:06:09.951 --> 01:06:12.101
-So Seattle, huh?
-Yeah.

01:06:12.431 --> 01:06:14.387
Don't worry. We have lots of room.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.110
-We'll get you there.
-We'll go straight there?

01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:19.222
We're not stopping for nothing.

01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:23.302
Well, there you are.

01:06:23.711 --> 01:06:26.179
Oh, you're gonna be really comfy in there.

01:06:32.631 --> 01:06:35.384
Just don't make any fast movements.

01:06:44.151 --> 01:06:45.630
What's that smell?

01:06:49.951 --> 01:06:50.940
Hello?

01:06:52.671 --> 01:06:53.990
Hi, Mr. Zebra.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:12.461
-I gotta report an attempted murder.
-Yo, Granger!

01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:14.470
You're catching!

01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:19.061
This is just perfect.

01:07:19.431 --> 01:07:21.626
So where did this happen?

01:07:21.831 --> 01:07:24.299
At the pet store. There were two of them.

01:07:24.391 --> 01:07:27.110
One was a real big guy,
looking like Pavarotti.

01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:29.222
I'm telling you, it was a hit.

01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:31.862
A hit? And you were the target?

01:07:32.031 --> 01:07:33.589
Dude, not me, the dog.

01:07:33.871 --> 01:07:36.021
-The dog?
-Spot was incredible.

01:07:36.191 --> 01:07:37.943
He got the bad guys.

01:07:38.111 --> 01:07:40.989
It was amazing.
He just took those two guys out.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:43.830
It's weird, I always thought
he was retarded.

01:07:44.511 --> 01:07:46.706
You know what? lf you're asking me...

01:07:46.791 --> 01:07:48.588
...you're the one who is retarded.

01:07:48.671 --> 01:07:51.231
Dude, he's not retarded. You are.

01:07:51.831 --> 01:07:53.059
Yeah? Well....

01:07:57.591 --> 01:07:59.309
-Know what I'm thinking?
-What?

01:07:59.391 --> 01:08:01.382
When Stephanie returns, I'll tell her...

01:08:01.471 --> 01:08:05.589
...not to leave James with a nut who
gets her kid a dog while she's away.

01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:07.941
Actually, that's not his dog at all.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:10.103
That's "Satan's dog."

01:08:13.111 --> 01:08:15.545
Let's leave. We don't need these idiots.

01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:17.419
Oh, man.

01:08:17.631 --> 01:08:18.950
Come on, Spot.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.944
Looks like Agent Sharp
skipped the country.

01:08:22.111 --> 01:08:23.544
She did not.

01:08:23.711 --> 01:08:26.305
We got ahold of all her credit card records.

01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:28.819
She bought a one-way ticket to Belize.

01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:30.510
She never made the airport.

01:08:30.591 --> 01:08:33.707
And let me tell you something,
if you don't get that dog...

01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:37.750
...you're gonna make the airport.
But as part of a runway!

01:08:38.591 --> 01:08:42.265
We're dead. We are so dead.

01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:45.060
You know, I never saw Godfather Ill.

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:47.626
I heard it wasn't as good as the first two.

01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:50.066
I thought we had more time, Gino.

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:52.666
Listen to me.

01:08:52.871 --> 01:08:55.145
Take a rest. We're gonna find the dog.

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:59.019
Hey, Gino, I didn't think
they let you out of Jersey.

01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:01.984
-What are you doing here?
-What do you say, Tommy?

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.426
I just got a little business to finish up.

01:09:04.511 --> 01:09:06.899
That's good. Great.

01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:11.984
I can't stand that clown.
He's got no respect.

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:16.826
-Hello.
-Yeah, I know who's got your dog.

01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:20.343
My neighbor. The guy's a freak.

01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:22.421
They got the dog. We got the dog.

01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:24.508
The bureau appreciates your help.

01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:27.707
A canine agent disappeared
in this area a few days ago.

01:09:27.911 --> 01:09:30.185
We are intent on finding that dog.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:33.109
What is it with the dogs all of a sudden?

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:37.462
I had this idiot in who said the Mafia
put a contract out on his dog.

01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:38.990
That's Agent 1 1 .

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:40.823
Yeah, and?

01:09:41.151 --> 01:09:45.429
He's my partner, you greasy-haired reptile.
Tell me everything.

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:52.189
I can't sleep.

01:09:54.151 --> 01:09:56.745
-Why not, buddy?
-I had a bad dream.

01:09:56.951 --> 01:09:58.145
About what?

01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:02.699
Charizard was trying to burn me,
and I had to run away.

01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:04.822
-Who's Charizard?
-A Pokémon.

01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:06.862
I thought Pikachu was the Pokémon.

01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:08.862
There's all different Pokémon.

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:12.627
-And they all have different powers?
-You catch on fast.

01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:17.501
And are they named
after what they sort of do?

01:10:17.831 --> 01:10:18.786
Kind of.

01:10:19.551 --> 01:10:23.942
Okay, so if you were a Pokémon,
you'd be Snotty-nose-achu.

01:10:24.151 --> 01:10:27.700
You would be Stinky-feet-achu.

01:10:31.391 --> 01:10:33.427
And you'd be Fart-in-bed-achu.

01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:35.270
It wasn't me.

01:10:35.471 --> 01:10:36.984
It wasn't me, either.

01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:39.950
Wait, if it wasn't me, and it wasn't you....

01:10:45.231 --> 01:10:46.664
Do you like my mom?

01:10:48.071 --> 01:10:50.426
Yeah. I really do.

01:10:50.591 --> 01:10:52.070
Why don't you marry her?

01:10:52.151 --> 01:10:55.541
Well, because, you know,
marriage is a big step.

01:10:55.711 --> 01:10:59.181
You really gotta know someone
before you do something like that.

01:10:59.431 --> 01:11:01.183
You'd be fun for a dad.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:03.785
You think so?

01:11:04.911 --> 01:11:05.821
Thanks.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:09.820
Hold it.

01:11:10.031 --> 01:11:11.862
I think this is the block.

01:11:12.071 --> 01:11:13.629
Yeah, let's go.

01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:15.822
And they lived happily ever after...

01:11:15.911 --> 01:11:18.869
...because they won the lottery
and moved to Hawaii.

01:11:25.631 --> 01:11:26.984
There you go.

01:11:57.431 --> 01:11:59.501
Don't hog all the blankets.

01:12:00.791 --> 01:12:03.180
I am so glad this is off our plate.

01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:06.861
Yeah, you look like you could use
something off your plate.

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.781
Have you seen any of these men?

01:12:23.391 --> 01:12:26.030
Yeah. These two.
They destroyed the pet store.

01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:31.708
If there's any cost for the damages,
they should be held responsible.

01:12:31.871 --> 01:12:35.386
You're very lucky, Mr. Smith.
These men are extremely dangerous.

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:39.146
You should be all right now that
Agent 1 1 is with us. 1 1, let's go!

01:12:39.231 --> 01:12:40.459
What?

01:12:40.991 --> 01:12:43.744
-No.
-Spot's leaving?

01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:48.503
I promised the dog to the kid.
You can't take the dog.

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:50.781
Don't take the dog. Look at the kid.

01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:55.023
-You can't take him.
-Agent 1 1 is U.S. Government property.

01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:56.823
But you can't take him.

01:13:03.071 --> 01:13:04.663
Come on, James.

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:07.263
Spot doesn't belong to us.

01:13:07.471 --> 01:13:09.939
I think he has to go back with these guys.

01:13:12.391 --> 01:13:14.063
Here we go, boy.

01:13:15.231 --> 01:13:17.347
He doesn't like that.

01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:19.866
Come on.

01:13:22.671 --> 01:13:24.548
Don't go, Spot.

01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:32.020
No!

01:14:03.711 --> 01:14:08.023
-You're gonna have to eat something.
-I'm not eating till Spot comes back.

01:14:08.631 --> 01:14:10.508
Well, Spot's not coming back.

01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:12.662
That's life. Get used to it.

01:14:21.871 --> 01:14:23.145
Let's see.

01:14:23.991 --> 01:14:25.583
You lost the dog.

01:14:25.791 --> 01:14:27.349
The boy wants you dead.

01:14:27.431 --> 01:14:29.865
No way you're getting jiggy
with his mama.

01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:33.546
That makes you a single man again,
brother. Give it to me up top.

01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:36.946
Okay, leave me hanging. Okay, cool.

01:14:37.151 --> 01:14:38.584
I'll remember that.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.584
I need you to eat.

01:14:51.391 --> 01:14:52.346
1 1, eat.

01:14:56.031 --> 01:14:58.499
You're gonna be stupid
and not do anything?

01:14:58.631 --> 01:15:00.826
I am doing something. I'm moving on.

01:15:00.991 --> 01:15:04.301
You should, too. Listen, James,
don't get attached to things.

01:15:04.391 --> 01:15:07.349
-It only ends up messing with you.
-But he's our dog.

01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:10.702
No, he's a government official,
much like myself.

01:15:10.911 --> 01:15:13.106
No, he's our dog and he loves us.

01:15:13.631 --> 01:15:15.349
Know what? You're just a kid.

01:15:15.431 --> 01:15:17.422
You know nothing. You're irrational!

01:15:17.511 --> 01:15:19.467
No, you're stupid!

01:15:27.831 --> 01:15:31.062
-Hello!
-Gordon, hi.

01:15:31.231 --> 01:15:32.664
Oh, it's you.

01:15:32.871 --> 01:15:36.659
You won't believe what I've been through,
but I'm really close now.

01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:39.391
Every time you call,
you got some lame excuse.

01:15:39.471 --> 01:15:41.939
What's it this time?
Dog ate your homework?

01:15:42.151 --> 01:15:44.506
Are you okay? ls everything all right?

01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:46.588
And always with the questions.

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.504
All I want to know is,
when are you gonna be here?

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.030
Gordon, what happened?

01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:53.909
I will not be treated
like an irresponsible idiot.

01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:56.027
You're the irresponsible one.

01:15:56.191 --> 01:15:57.260
It's your fault!

01:15:57.351 --> 01:15:59.546
I shouldn't be watching a dog...

01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:02.305
...and I sure don't need some kid in my life.

01:16:07.191 --> 01:16:08.146
Stop!

01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:10.581
You're taking me to my kid, now!

01:16:52.951 --> 01:16:54.907
Agent 1 1 ! He's escaped.

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:56.826
Agent 1 1 !

01:17:09.071 --> 01:17:11.141
All right, truce. Come out here.

01:17:20.431 --> 01:17:22.103
Come on, this isn't funny.

01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:30.741
My kid. I lost my kid.

01:17:37.431 --> 01:17:39.103
Keep your mouth shut.

01:17:43.351 --> 01:17:44.670
This is suicide.

01:17:44.791 --> 01:17:47.510
How in the hell could you guys
let Agent 1 1 escape?

01:17:47.591 --> 01:17:49.502
You'll all be reprimanded.

01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:52.190
Where you going?

01:17:52.551 --> 01:17:55.384
To find my dog,
and I know exactly where he went.

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:57.589
Back to those two.

01:18:08.071 --> 01:18:11.268
I thought you were dead. Get in the truck.

01:18:13.231 --> 01:18:16.507
-Come on, buddy, get in the truck.
-I'm gonna find Spot.

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:20.989
How you gonna find him?
Think you're a detective?

01:18:33.791 --> 01:18:35.349
Why did you run away?

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:38.830
What do you care? You don't want me.

01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:41.225
What?

01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:44.547
No, I didn't mean it like that.

01:18:44.871 --> 01:18:46.941
Why did you say that to my mom?

01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:51.743
You know, I was just scared.

01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:55.984
And sometimes, when people get upset...

01:18:56.191 --> 01:18:58.102
...it comes out all messed up.

01:18:59.591 --> 01:19:00.944
Do you miss Spot?

01:19:03.191 --> 01:19:04.783
Yeah, I guess I do.

01:19:05.831 --> 01:19:08.345
I'm really glad you ended up
staying with me.

01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:10.308
Glad we became pals.

01:19:11.751 --> 01:19:15.027
I didn't mean what I said to your ma.
Not even a little bit.

01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:18.543
Think you could forgive me?

01:19:25.111 --> 01:19:28.023
It's okay, Gordon. I'm glad we're friends.

01:19:30.751 --> 01:19:31.706
Me too.

01:19:36.191 --> 01:19:38.307
There they are. Back it up.

01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:40.987
It's those guys. Come on!

01:19:41.751 --> 01:19:43.423
Get back there! Hold on!

01:19:53.471 --> 01:19:55.109
-James, you okay?
-Yeah.

01:19:56.631 --> 01:19:59.668
-Throw those boxes at them.
-All right!

01:20:02.911 --> 01:20:05.903
Dive bomb! Depth charge!

01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:07.863
-Watch it!
-I got it.

01:20:12.991 --> 01:20:15.061
This mailman's gonna lose his job.

01:20:15.871 --> 01:20:17.190
Where'd they go?

01:20:23.871 --> 01:20:25.384
James, are you okay?

01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:27.104
Look what I found.

01:20:27.311 --> 01:20:29.188
Good idea. Come on.

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.744
Police!

01:20:33.791 --> 01:20:34.780
Police!

01:20:34.991 --> 01:20:37.141
Help! 91 1 !

01:20:37.511 --> 01:20:38.546
Help!

01:20:42.111 --> 01:20:44.227
That's gotta hurt.

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.146
Hurry, James!

01:20:51.231 --> 01:20:54.223
-Hey, get over here!
-Give me the dog!

01:20:54.431 --> 01:20:56.422
Where's the dog? Get over here.

01:21:07.831 --> 01:21:11.187
Help me! Come on!

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:23.710
Come on, get off.

01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:31.426
Help.

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:36.060
Run!

01:21:49.311 --> 01:21:52.223
I'll save you from calling the cops.
We got one here.

01:21:52.431 --> 01:21:53.910
Sit down over there.

01:21:53.991 --> 01:21:55.549
And you, shut up.

01:21:57.431 --> 01:21:58.659
Where is that mutt?

01:21:58.751 --> 01:22:00.628
I thought he was with the FBl.

01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:03.544
He escaped to be with you.

01:22:04.871 --> 01:22:07.431
How touching. I'm all choked up.

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:10.907
Could you loan me a handkerchief
while we wait for the mutt?

01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:18.790
Somebody help me here.

01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:20.668
Get off of me!

01:22:24.591 --> 01:22:25.944
Come here, you.

01:22:27.071 --> 01:22:28.345
That's it.

01:22:28.831 --> 01:22:30.867
Mr. Talia, what are you doing here?

01:22:30.951 --> 01:22:34.546
I took a wild guess and figured
you two baboons would screw it up.

01:22:34.631 --> 01:22:37.270
-Sit down, the both of youse.
-Sonny, the dog--

01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:39.546
-It wasn't our fault.
-No?

01:22:39.711 --> 01:22:42.862
I don't know if it's worth
the bullets for the two of you.

01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:45.266
I gotta ask my accountant. Afterwards.

01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:49.742
Excuse me, Mr. Mob Boss Guy, I wouldn't
make any sudden moves if I were you.

01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:51.782
You wouldn't, you punk? Why not?

01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:55.227
-I don't think Spot would like that.
-And who is Spot?

01:23:00.311 --> 01:23:01.539
Spot!

01:23:07.111 --> 01:23:08.180
Come on.

01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:10.025
Come on.

01:23:18.271 --> 01:23:19.420
1 1, the gun!

01:23:21.191 --> 01:23:22.943
You take it.

01:23:44.831 --> 01:23:46.423
-Spot!
-1 1 !

01:23:46.831 --> 01:23:48.150
Kick him, James!

01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:51.341
Run, James! Run!

01:23:56.311 --> 01:23:59.064
No, not again! Come on!

01:23:59.271 --> 01:24:02.104
No, not again.

01:24:07.711 --> 01:24:10.145
-Hey, Spot.
-You're the greatest, Spot.

01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:12.742
Hey, what do you got there, boy?

01:24:20.711 --> 01:24:22.144
All right, get up!

01:24:23.631 --> 01:24:25.383
Scratchy, scratchy, good dog!

01:24:25.471 --> 01:24:27.621
Good boy. I love you.

01:24:28.191 --> 01:24:29.590
Agent 1 1 ...

01:24:30.391 --> 01:24:31.506
...come on.

01:24:31.871 --> 01:24:34.180
His name's Spot. He's staying with us.

01:24:35.591 --> 01:24:39.061
Open up your eyes, man.
This dog's got a lot going on inside.

01:24:40.231 --> 01:24:42.699
He just wants to be a dog, with a family.

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:46.142
He's never had a family before,
and it's been really rough.

01:24:46.911 --> 01:24:48.264
The FBI is his family.

01:24:48.351 --> 01:24:50.546
The FBI is not a family. It's a job.

01:24:50.631 --> 01:24:53.225
Come on. He's got a chance
to be happy now...

01:24:53.991 --> 01:24:56.107
...with people that care about him.

01:24:56.231 --> 01:24:59.701
I want to give him a home.
I won't let you mess that up.

01:25:00.511 --> 01:25:03.309
I think it's time that Spot
decides what he wants.

01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:06.388
I can't ask him. He's a dog.

01:25:06.911 --> 01:25:09.300
Let's just see. Let's see what he wants.

01:25:33.511 --> 01:25:34.705
Good boy, Spot.

01:25:52.351 --> 01:25:53.466
What is it?

01:25:54.871 --> 01:25:56.429
What do you want, boy?

01:25:57.991 --> 01:25:59.310
What is it, boy?

01:26:01.471 --> 01:26:02.904
I'll miss you, too.

01:26:11.711 --> 01:26:13.144
Thanks for the ride.

01:26:13.391 --> 01:26:15.507
Benny! What happened?

01:26:15.711 --> 01:26:17.542
I don't believe anybody's dead.

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:20.862
Gordon and James took down
a mob boss and his henchmen--

01:26:22.631 --> 01:26:24.462
Gordon gonna need some help.

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:27.103
We need a SWAT team, man.

01:26:28.271 --> 01:26:30.990
Then you hit the guy in the head
with the meatballs?

01:26:31.071 --> 01:26:32.299
That was funny.

01:26:33.591 --> 01:26:34.910
Mom!

01:26:35.551 --> 01:26:36.870
What's going on?

01:26:40.151 --> 01:26:41.300
Oh, my God!

01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:44.987
-Stephanie. You look great.
-We had the greatest time!

01:26:45.151 --> 01:26:50.066
Gordon had me under his arm and then
two bad guys with guns chased us.

01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:54.344
There were dogs everywhere,
and this is Spot, the dog Gordon gave me.

01:26:57.311 --> 01:27:01.304
You look like you had a hard trip.
Maybe we should talk about this later.

01:27:01.471 --> 01:27:05.464
If you ever come within 50 feet of my son,
I'll call the police.

01:27:05.671 --> 01:27:08.583
Well, Stephanie, I live 25 feet away.

01:27:08.791 --> 01:27:10.827
Those came in very handy.

01:27:12.511 --> 01:27:14.103
I can explain.

01:27:21.311 --> 01:27:22.380
Come on.

01:27:32.631 --> 01:27:34.508
Hey there, music man.

01:27:39.831 --> 01:27:43.870
I'm gonna catch you in the yard.
We're gonna settle this, man to man.

01:27:52.991 --> 01:27:54.868
-What's up, G?
-Yo, what's up?

01:27:54.951 --> 01:27:57.306
I'm all right. You know what, man?

01:27:57.831 --> 01:28:00.982
-He's not such a bad dog after all.
-No, he's a good dog.

01:28:06.551 --> 01:28:08.781
You really dug Stephanie, didn't you?

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:13.630
Now she just sees you
as unreliable, immature...

01:28:13.951 --> 01:28:17.944
...irresponsible, fly-by-night,
bad kid-watching dude.

01:28:20.671 --> 01:28:22.024
You want a hug, man?

01:28:22.111 --> 01:28:26.263
No, I'd rather not. I'll just take the dog
to the park or something.

01:28:26.711 --> 01:28:28.827
-But thanks, man.
-Go on and walk your dog.

01:28:28.911 --> 01:28:30.867
All right. See you later.

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:35.586
Do you like it? There you go. Thanks.

01:28:35.671 --> 01:28:36.945
Hey!

01:28:38.591 --> 01:28:39.990
I'm sorry.

01:28:43.391 --> 01:28:44.824
What? What's this?

01:28:50.671 --> 01:28:53.549
What's up, buddy? Trying to jump me?

01:28:58.751 --> 01:29:01.140
You two turning to a life of crime now?

01:29:02.231 --> 01:29:03.869
-Here.
-Thanks.

01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:05.944
So, you're a hero now.

01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:09.307
James tells me you and Spot
saved him from the bad guys.

01:29:09.471 --> 01:29:13.146
I actually thought he was exaggerating
because he likes you so much.

01:29:14.071 --> 01:29:18.906
-It's really true. He's an FBI agent.
-I actually checked it out.

01:29:21.711 --> 01:29:25.306
It sounds like you saved James' life, too.
Thank you.

01:29:30.111 --> 01:29:31.829
Listen, l...

01:29:32.831 --> 01:29:37.302
...l think maybe I might have jumped
to conclusions about you...

01:29:37.471 --> 01:29:40.463
...and I wonder if you'd
like to give it another shot.

01:29:40.911 --> 01:29:43.141
"It"? You mean us?

01:29:43.871 --> 01:29:45.065
The two of us.

01:29:50.391 --> 01:29:52.700
If you make it the three of us, I'm in.

01:29:57.551 --> 01:30:00.190
Okay! The four of us. Sorry.

01:30:00.631 --> 01:30:01.746
Come on.

01:30:02.591 --> 01:30:05.310
-Go get your ball, Spot!
-Go get it! Go on!
