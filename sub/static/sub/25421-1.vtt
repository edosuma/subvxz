And away.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.722
- Getting a full one?
- Yeah. We've got to get a full one.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.139
I hate 'em without handles.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.937
I know.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.903
- Do you want me to...?
- No, it's all right, I got it. OK.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.198
- Your wages.
- Yeah, thanks.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.204
Was it something we said?

02:10.088 --> 02:12.000
Er, we um...

02:13.133 --> 02:15.090
My dad died.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.170
Oh, Alice.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.435
When you're ready to come back...

02:27.606 --> 02:29.313
Probably not coming back.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.933
He... promised farm to me.

02:32.069 --> 02:35.107
- That's good news, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah, be good, yeah.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.613
Be good to settle.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.992
You know, see my brother and...

02:50.212 --> 02:52.420
Well, there'll always be
a place for you here.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.967
Hey. Sshh.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.060
Who are you, eh?

08:02.190 --> 08:05.024
Oh. You're one of Fly's, are you?

08:34.222 --> 08:35.962
Hey.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.847
Joe?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.814
Joe?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.859
Joe?

12:21.783 --> 12:23.649
Oh, stop!

12:49.644 --> 12:50.976
Come on!

12:51.104 --> 12:53.517
It's not gonna be that cold. Come on!

12:53.648 --> 12:55.856
Oh, my God, look at that.
That's awesome.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.271
I am not getting in that.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.941
Who's going in first?

13:02.073 --> 13:03.939
You are.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.067
Come on, guys!

13:06.911 --> 13:09.449
To be fair, I wouldn't mind going in.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.078
Come on!

16:04.672 --> 16:05.958
Sshh.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.127
Hey, hey, hey! Sshh.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.014
Oh...

16:24.859 --> 16:26.851
Hep.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.772
Oh, God.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.072
Oh, lassie.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.569
Let me see.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.240
Hey.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.382
I'll get gun, eh? Let's get you sorted.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.050
Sshh, Billie, Billie.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.216
- Sshh. Sshh. Sshh.
- She bred out of Fly, is she?

17:38.266 --> 17:40.349
Eh? Er...

17:40.476 --> 17:42.138
Erm... No, no, she's...

17:45.189 --> 17:48.307
I paid good money for her - Â£500, like.

17:48.442 --> 17:53.107
I've wasted her. She's... She's more of
an alarm system than a working dog.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.526
Needs an owner that can do better for you,
don't you?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.088
Where were you?

18:12.216 --> 18:14.299
- I were contracted...
- Don't.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.420
You don't need to chat shit.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.382
I'm here now.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.100
And what good is that?

18:25.146 --> 18:27.183
Really? I mean, it's too late now, innit?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.981
He's gone.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.027
- I've been driving all night.
- Where's key for gun cabinet?

18:38.159 --> 18:40.776
- I've got to get my head down.
- There's a yow needs culling.

18:40.911 --> 18:44.200
- I'm not giving you my gun.
- Well, better get up there, hadn't you?

18:52.590 --> 18:55.082
I haven't seen you for 15 years.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.925
You've...

19:03.934 --> 19:05.141
I'll...

19:05.269 --> 19:06.885
I'll wait with her.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.063
Can you call knacker man?

19:26.582 --> 19:29.120
It's all right.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.083
Be over soon.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.874
All right.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.541
Stay there.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.841
You all right, love?

19:37.968 --> 19:41.427
Yeah. She's broke her leg.
She's done for.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.262
Alice?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.259
It's David. Spider.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.726
Yeah, it's her left one.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.353
Aye.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.652
Aye.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.251
20, is it?

20:13.379 --> 20:16.167
You didn't know I were knacker man,
did you?

20:16.298 --> 20:19.166
- I got out of farming a while back now.
- You said 20, did you?

20:21.262 --> 20:22.503
Aye.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.646
- Your Joe still hanging on, is he?
- Yeah.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.514
He's proper fucked now, in't he?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.516
No, he's all right, actually.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.232
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.529
You know where to find me.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.528
Where you stopping?

21:21.655 --> 21:23.362
Prefab.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.153
Don't be daft. Stop in house.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.318
Oh!

22:48.951 --> 22:51.159
Go on, hold my hand.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.574
Go on, then. Take one step. One step.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.618
No, no, you gotta hold my hand properly.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.991
Erm... I've made you summat to eat.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.954
Erm... I'm not hungry. It's fine.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.749
Go on, then.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.158
I expect you've been all over, then.

24:15.537 --> 24:19.076
Yeah, well, er... there's a circuit,
you know.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.666
- New Zealand, Norway.
- Yeah?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.080
Anywhere there's sheep.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.578
- Want one? No?
- No.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.372
Well...

24:27.508 --> 24:29.875
you've seen the world.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.297
Well, you must have been some places.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.795
Dover.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.056
To pick up spuds.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.977
I used to get over to Ireland.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.188
On wagons, like.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.399
Yeah, it were great.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.979
Ferry and that.

24:54.284 --> 24:57.277
Most of the time, just been grafting here,
you know what it's like.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.706
And looking after Dad.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.626
I've applied for tenancy.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.130
Eh?

25:19.643 --> 25:21.384
Interview's tomorrow.

25:23.689 --> 25:28.059
I'll do hard graft. You can...
You can give up lorries.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.615
Dad promised it to me.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.792
Sorry? Am I fucking losing it?

26:09.943 --> 26:12.276
You know he were asking for you,
don't you?

26:13.739 --> 26:16.197
Oh, yeah. He kept on asking,
"When's she coming?"

26:16.325 --> 26:19.443
And I had to...
Well, I had to lie to him, didn't I?

26:20.496 --> 26:22.783
I had to make shit up on your behalf.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.222
Um... Will you get out, please?

26:44.561 --> 26:46.268
- Get out.
- Joe...

26:49.024 --> 26:50.981
Please, can you just get out?

27:56.300 --> 27:58.132
- You're early.
- Rowan Spender.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.675
Lead the way.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.523
What you doing?

28:24.369 --> 28:25.951
This is land agent.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.659
Water Corporation sent him.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.201
Rowan Spender.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.826
Fuck off. I don't care who you are.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.873
You can fuck off out my house.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.213
Now.

28:47.184 --> 28:48.516
Sorry.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.307
Oh, um... We can go in there.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.526
You know, technically,
the farm should go to me.

29:02.658 --> 29:03.648
You know that, don't you?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.741
We don't seem to have received
your application.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.701
Fuck off with your applications!

29:07.829 --> 29:10.788
I swear to fucking God, I've grafted
on this land since I could walk.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.624
We do expect our tenant
to maintain our properties better.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.745
- Bib-bib-bib-bib-bib!
- Joe.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.247
Is that right?
And what would you know about it, eh?

29:19.383 --> 29:20.669
Joe!

29:20.801 --> 29:23.214
I mean, where do they find
little boys like you?

29:23.345 --> 29:26.258
Dressed in little uniforms,
pottering about like a little pussy.

29:27.975 --> 29:31.719
You come here, treat me like I'm some
rare breed out of a fucking textbook!

29:31.853 --> 29:34.596
It's all fucking assets
and lifestyle to you lot, ain't it?

29:34.731 --> 29:36.347
- Sorry about that.
- No. No, no, no.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.224
You're all selfish fucking twats!

29:38.360 --> 29:39.692
- So...
- I'm sorry.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.062
OK.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.484
The land's in poor condition.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.699
Barn roof and the mortar need replacing

29:46.827 --> 29:49.444
or you could be found
in breach of your contract.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.195
And the rats are a problem.

29:51.331 --> 29:55.450
Look... my dad and my brother have
done their best but they've let it go.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.624
I wanna sort it...

29:59.298 --> 30:01.790
get it back to how it were
when my mum and nanna ran it.

30:01.925 --> 30:05.464
And what is the situation
with your brother?

30:07.472 --> 30:09.805
Erm... well,
we can work it together.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.426
- He's not done a very good job of...
- No, I know, I know, but I'll sort it.

30:16.773 --> 30:20.687
Look, he's just...
he's not himself with my dad... dying.

30:26.867 --> 30:30.110
If you make a start fixing
the holding up.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.822
Maintaining boundaries,
deal with vermin...

30:37.919 --> 30:39.956
I'd say you're in
with a very good chance.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.840
Thank you.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.197
Away. Away.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.741
Lie down. Lie down.
Lie down. Lie down, Billie.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.037
Hey, Joe.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.711
She's dead intelligent.
Reckon I could train her up.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.631
No, it's too late now.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.348
Joe.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.098
Yeah?

31:42.818 --> 31:44.559
I should have come back.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.070
But I just...

31:48.198 --> 31:50.030
I couldn't face him.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.581
Did he suffer?

32:08.301 --> 32:10.463
Yeah, he did.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.179
Away.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.108
Away. Away.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.935
Away.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.358
Away. Lie down.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.321
Lie down.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.369
Come by.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.335
Come by. Come by.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.920
Come by.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.146
What are you doing?

34:31.277 --> 34:33.315
- I'm doing rats.
- No, no, no, no.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.187
- No, no, no, don't do that.
- Why?

34:36.949 --> 34:39.658
No, no, there's owls in here.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.322
Up there, there's fledglings.

34:41.454 --> 34:44.367
Ohh!

34:44.498 --> 34:46.616
- There.
- Oh, wow.

34:49.504 --> 34:50.960
Oh, there...

34:51.089 --> 34:53.706
- Sshh.
- Been a while.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.105
Wait.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.099
We should cut that field.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.149
I don't cut for silage.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.863
I leave it for hay.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.153
They're all skin and bone.

35:23.413 --> 35:25.245
Come here.

35:26.416 --> 35:28.703
I wanna show you summat.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.590
It's shepherd's needle.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.302
You don't see it very often.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.346
Not round here, anyway.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.566
When it comes through its seed pods,
they look like a needle.

35:55.737 --> 35:58.275
When you cut it for silage,
all you end up doing is...

36:00.116 --> 36:02.278
...killing everything that's under it.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.155
In one acre of hay meadow...

36:08.833 --> 36:10.825
...you've got 400 million insects.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.955
600 million mites.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.170
Two million spiders.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.304
Burnet moths.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.424
Butterflies, bees.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.886
Voles, shrews.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.019
Yeah, yeah...

36:44.744 --> 36:46.781
But, Joe...

36:46.913 --> 36:48.654
silage is better for 'em.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.207
Maybe we just... cut it just this year?

36:56.172 --> 36:57.208
No.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.377
Only take contractor couple of hours.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.501
We can't afford a contractor.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.390
- Look, what if I sell a few lambs?
- No, no. You're not selling my lambs.

37:08.518 --> 37:11.135
- We gotta do summat!
- It's too early! I sell 'em fat!

37:11.271 --> 37:14.139
- Yeah, but it'll grow back.
- I said no! I said no!

37:43.344 --> 37:47.509
I can clip flock,
cut bale and wrap silage.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.432
415 all in.

37:55.315 --> 37:58.103
- What are you hoping for?
- 50 a head.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.060
Think you'll get that?

38:01.821 --> 38:03.232
Yeah.

38:05.575 --> 38:08.158
I can do it for 400. Deal?

38:08.286 --> 38:09.993
Yeah. Thanks, Jim.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.862
You'll be right.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.330
Hup!

38:18.671 --> 38:20.537
Alice! Alice!

38:20.673 --> 38:23.586
- I'd heard you were back.
- Matty! Long time no see.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.176
Aye. And if there's owt you want,
let us know.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.636
Bell. Keld Farm.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.632
- Ta. That's kind of you, Matty.
- I mean it.

38:31.893 --> 38:35.057
- All right, I've gotta go.
- Bell. Keld Farm.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.225
I'm looking for um... 50 per head.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.647
Right, where we gonna be there?

38:46.783 --> 38:48.445
50.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.989
Want 45... 40.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.611
40 B. 40 B. 40 B. 40 B.

40.50 B. 40.50.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.453
41.50, 41.50, 41.50, 41.50, 41.50, 41.50.

39:00.588 --> 39:01.999

39:02.131 --> 39:06.045
At 42, B 42.50, 42.50,
42.50, 42.50, 42.50.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.511
Last chance. At 42.50

39:10.557 --> 39:11.843
Scowcroft.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.466
Eight at 42.50

39:17.230 --> 39:20.439
Bad luck, love.
Your Joe won't be too pleased.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.857
Look, tell you what,
I'll do job for 300.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.902
Your dad would have wanted me
to look out for you.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.070
It hurt him when you didn't come back.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.904
Thought they'd have gi' you
some time off for funeral.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.826
A lot came. He were well-liked.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.200
Well, Jim,
you don't know shite, all right?

39:40.670 --> 39:42.787
- Where you going?
- I'll find someone else.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.914
I'm doing you a favour here!

39:45.508 --> 39:48.091
You won't get anyone else
do it for that money, you know?

39:48.219 --> 39:51.132
You know what? Your mother were
an hard-nosed bitch an' all!

39:53.683 --> 39:57.302
He should have taught both of you
some respect, the soft bastard!

40:04.611 --> 40:06.273
Fuck!

41:43.376 --> 41:45.618
Away!

42:05.314 --> 42:06.771
Thanks.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.837
Go on.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.345
- Matty.
- Yeah?

42:46.481 --> 42:47.722
Here.

42:50.026 --> 42:52.268
- Shall we crack on?
- Yeah, look, Matty, I'm...

42:52.403 --> 42:56.363
- I'm sorry it's not much. I...
- Don't worry about it.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.422
I don't fucking believe it.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.089
Alice?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.840
You've sold my fucking lambs, haven't you?

43:22.975 --> 43:26.059
- I only sold eight. Now we can afford...
- It don't matter. No, no, no.

43:26.187 --> 43:27.849
I told you not to
and you've fucking done it!

43:27.980 --> 43:30.017
You've been away on shift.
Things have to be done.

43:30.149 --> 43:31.310
I don't care!
You've gone behind my back.

43:31.442 --> 43:32.649
I told you not to fucking do it

43:32.777 --> 43:35.440
and you've gone and done it,
haven't you?

43:36.614 --> 43:39.482
Selling my lambs to pay your wages now?
Is that how it's going?

43:40.201 --> 43:42.784
- I thought you knew.
- You ain't got enough going on in...

43:42.912 --> 43:44.619
I thought you...

43:45.248 --> 43:47.160
Pack it in! Pack it in!

43:50.378 --> 43:52.540
Don't lay a finger on my sheep
without my say-so.

43:52.672 --> 43:54.629
You're lucky to have her.

43:56.259 --> 43:57.750
Are you OK?

43:57.885 --> 43:59.296
Yeah, fine.

44:00.263 --> 44:02.550
- Take your money.
- I don't want it. You can fuck off.

44:02.682 --> 44:04.674
Don't want your charity.

44:14.527 --> 44:16.644
What the fuck are you playing at?

44:16.779 --> 44:18.566
Eh?

44:18.698 --> 44:21.281
What, are you showing me up
in front of neighbours now?

44:21.409 --> 44:23.366
That the game?

44:25.329 --> 44:28.788
- What you doing with that?
- I thought I'd spray 'em.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.373
I don't spray 'em. I dip 'em.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.702
- Dip's not good for you.
- Well, I dip 'em!

44:36.174 --> 44:37.961
Go on, dip's where it always is.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.181
Get up there.

45:46.327 --> 45:47.534
Ssh.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.743
I've struggled with you being back here.

45:58.172 --> 46:00.164
No, no, I find it hard.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.715
Do you wish I hadn't come?

46:11.727 --> 46:13.389
Ssh.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.935
I've got succession rights and...

46:22.071 --> 46:24.154
I'm gonna claim for tenancy.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.237
Joe...

46:34.667 --> 46:36.329
Can we talk about this, please?

46:44.302 --> 46:46.339
Keep an eye on her.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.706
Do you like my tattoo?

47:24.842 --> 47:26.208
It's all right, yeah.

47:26.344 --> 47:28.006
Do you like me?

47:57.375 --> 47:59.367
What do you want?

48:00.878 --> 48:02.540
Is someone living in there?

48:04.215 --> 48:06.878
No, it's just for feed and that.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.334
It's your sister, isn't it?

48:11.889 --> 48:14.973
Simon Shawcross.
Acquisitions, North Moors Water.

48:15.101 --> 48:17.218
Can I have a word?

48:26.987 --> 48:29.900
These farms aren't making any money
any more, are they, eh?

48:34.745 --> 48:37.453
We sell quite a few of them on
to property developers now.

48:40.376 --> 48:42.413
There's 100 grand in it for the tenant.

48:44.755 --> 48:47.088
We interviewed your sister. Point is...

48:48.843 --> 48:50.459
...we need the farm back.

48:52.471 --> 48:55.179
So if we er...
award the tenancy to you,

48:56.350 --> 48:58.216
technically, she'd be trespassing.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.350
So, you evict her, we buy you out.

49:04.608 --> 49:06.895
Money in your pocket.
How's that sound?

49:14.285 --> 49:16.151
I'll er... I'll leave you my number.

49:18.747 --> 49:20.659
Give us a ring.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.748
Get it sorted, yeah?

51:35.301 --> 51:36.633
Hey, listen.

51:38.512 --> 51:41.004
If I am awarded this tenancy,
you'll ha' to go.

51:42.016 --> 51:43.257
- What?
- All right?

51:43.392 --> 51:45.099
I don't understand.

51:45.227 --> 51:47.640
If I'm awarded it, you can stay on,
you can work with me.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.387
Won't work.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.117
No, don't, it's all I got!

54:16.253 --> 54:17.835
No!

54:20.924 --> 54:22.460
Oh, sh...

54:22.593 --> 54:24.505
I'll fucking kill you!

54:40.402 --> 54:42.064
Oh, shit!

54:42.905 --> 54:44.066
Get here!

54:44.198 --> 54:45.734
Oh, fuck!

55:36.458 --> 55:38.290
You can't just bring that down here!

55:38.418 --> 55:42.458
Get it fucking off my land right now!
I ain't fucking about! Get out my way!

55:42.589 --> 55:45.832
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

55:46.802 --> 55:49.545
Fuck off! Fuck off!

55:49.680 --> 55:51.387
- Fuck...
- Steady now.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.848
All right, OK.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.558
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.594
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.347
Fuck's sa-aake!

56:36.268 --> 56:38.009
Get Nailer, will you?

56:40.314 --> 56:42.306
He's a good ratter, this one.

56:46.111 --> 56:47.352
So, what's up?

56:48.655 --> 56:50.647
Joe lost it last night.

56:51.533 --> 56:54.321
- He tried to set fire to my Land Rover.
- Oh, God.

56:54.453 --> 56:56.536
- He were dead drunk.
- That's just no excuse.

56:58.332 --> 56:59.868
He were arrested.

57:02.002 --> 57:03.743
Matty, it were me that called 'em.

57:07.341 --> 57:10.004
Well, he shouldn't have done it.
So you did right thing.

57:10.135 --> 57:13.344
- I don't...
- He's an idiot. You did the right thing.

57:14.348 --> 57:15.589
Yeah?

57:16.683 --> 57:18.265
Go on.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.869
Ssh. Come on, you.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.353
Nailer?

58:23.083 --> 58:24.574
Nailer?

58:29.464 --> 58:31.126
Where are you?

59:09.337 --> 59:11.329
'Alice?

59:13.091 --> 59:14.673
'Alice?

59:14.801 --> 59:16.633
- Yeah.
- 'Did you go with that lad?'

59:22.517 --> 59:24.304
'You told him? You bastard!'

59:38.241 --> 59:40.198
See what you've done to me?

59:40.911 --> 59:42.277
Eh?

59:42.412 --> 59:43.823
Go on.

59:45.957 --> 59:48.074
Alice? Alice?

59:51.713 --> 59:53.249
Out!

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:05.592
I've gotta go down that police station
every fucking week because of you now.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:11.226
- You came at me, Joe.
- You tell 'em you come at me with shears?

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.065
- Did ya?
- You came at me.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.276
No, you didn't tell 'em that bit, did you?

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.236
Get off!

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:00.571
Calm down.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:03.112
Watch your fucking mouth!

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.866
You all right?

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.952
Yeah.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.630
- Is that for me, is it?
- It's not for me.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.597
Not here.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.632
Alice!

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:04.065
Is Mr Bell home?

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.274
I need to speak with both of you.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.673
Well...

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.303
After much consideration,

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:40.728
it has been decided that the tenancy
will be awarded to Joe Bell.

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:46.604
You're mad.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:51.367
He can't... He can't even look after
himself, never mind a farm.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.486
The decision's been made higher up.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:59.371
Mr Bell, if you could just sign here
for me, please.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.995
Joe?

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.381
Joe... Joe?

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.168
It's nothing personal.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.421
Joe...

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.765
I've... tried so hard. Joe...

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:17.350
Don't take it from me. I've tried...

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.345
Stop! Just stop!

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:21.689
All right. How's it ever gonna work?

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.728
You're scared...

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.318
every time
you set foot in the fucking door.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.986
Hey! Hey!

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:24.369
That's it, draw them in, draw them in.
Bring them round. Bring them round.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.545
Oi. What you doing?

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:32.669
Taking 'em to auction.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:36.214
What?

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:38.636
No.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.680
No!

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.769
- Bring 'em round.
- Hey, shh.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:53.481
Come on, out you get.
Hey, come on.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.608
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:03.665
What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.785
Come on.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:10.172
- Come on.
- Get in there, get in there!

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.212
No. You can't.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:14.335
- You can't do this.
- Fuck's sake!

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.508
No, he promised me.
No, he promised me.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:19.882
Just stop it. Stop it! Just stop!

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.011
It's finished!

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.347
Get in there. Sshh, sshh. Get in there.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:35.027
I said, fucking no!

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.739
Hey.

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.863
Hey!

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:22.133
'Alice?'

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:32.764
No.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.607
No!

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.358
Here.

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.481
It's OK. It's OK.

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.027
You told me not to tell anyone.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:48.287
Did you think it was something
I ought to be ashamed of?

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:52.368
No, I...

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:57.874
I was trying to protect you.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.357
Why'd you never say owt to him?

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.238
I were a child.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.078
Told me to keep quiet.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.837
I were a child.

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.933
I saw you go to him.

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:03.655
I just...

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.901
I couldn't stand waiting.

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:15.827
Not knowing when he were gonna...

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.832
...he were gonna...

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.019
Why didn't you stop him?

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.362
Why didn't you stop him?

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:56.826
Alice...

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.803
No, no, no!

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:56.097
- What you doing?
- No, no, no.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.141
You evicting me, are you? Are you?

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:00.184
They've bought me out.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.809
That's why they give me tenancy
cos I agreed to a fucking buy-out.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:05.561
I'm sorry.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.188
