any real protection.

Listen, if it'll make you feel any better,
I'll put the safety on.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.367
Whoops!
Guess it was already on.

13:25.671 --> 13:29.630
Uh, I'd better just put it down.

13:32.244 --> 13:35.111
No offense, Mom,
but that was pretty cool.

13:35.214 --> 13:40.948
Homer, I think you'd agree that
I've put up with a lot in this marriage.

13:46.225 --> 13:49.490
But this is the first time
since we've been married...

13:49.595 --> 13:52.564
that I've actually feared for our lives.

13:52.665 --> 13:57.932
So I'm asking you, if you really care
about me and the children...

13:58.037 --> 14:01.200
please, please get rid of the gun.

14:07.546 --> 14:11.949
All right, Marge.
I'll do it for you.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.110
[Moaning]

14:14.220 --> 14:16.120
I'm a lucky woman.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.952
And I'm a wonderful man.

14:19.058 --> 14:23.188
[Straining]
Aw! I don't feel them.

14:23.295 --> 14:27.197
You said there'd be "Fudgeicles," Bart.
Where's the "Fudgeicles"?

14:27.299 --> 14:29.893
First, it's Fudgsicle.

14:30.002 --> 14:33.961
And I know they're up here.
I just need a better foothold.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.200
Hello!

14:36.308 --> 14:40.005
And the next marksman is
William Tell, Jr.!

14:40.112 --> 14:42.012
Jinx!

14:42.114 --> 14:44.981
[Gasps]
Bart!

14:45.084 --> 14:48.212
Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.288
You lied to me!

14:50.389 --> 14:52.721
You promised to get rid of this gun.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.123
I put it in a safe place, Marge.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.958
I mean, what are the odds the boy
would look in the vegetable crisper?

14:59.064 --> 15:01.259
How could you?

15:01.367 --> 15:06.304
Of all the terrible things you've ever
done in your life, this is the worst...

15:06.405 --> 15:08.600
<i>the most despicable!</i>

15:08.707 --> 15:13.644
- But, Marge, I swear to you,
I never thought you'd find out!
- [Groans]

15:13.746 --> 15:16.408
Until you decide
what's more important...

15:16.515 --> 15:18.574
your gun or your family...

15:18.684 --> 15:20.743
we can't live in the same house.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.287
Come on, kids.

15:23.389 --> 15:27.086
So this is the thanks I get
for protecting my family?

15:27.192 --> 15:30.650
Then go!
I'll be just fine!

15:33.432 --> 15:36.424
- Do you know how to cook dinner?
- Do I?

15:46.412 --> 15:48.676
- I've left Homer.
- Thank God.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.182
So we need a place
to spend the night.

15:52.284 --> 15:56.152
Try the Sleep-Eazy Motel.
I woke up there once. Seemed nice.

15:56.255 --> 16:01.022
- Why can't we stay here?
- Uh, we have a gentleman caller.

16:01.126 --> 16:05.153
Hey, this TV's not broken.
It's just unplugged. What the-

16:08.567 --> 16:11.058
- Ooh, the gun club's gonna be here any minute.
- <i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

16:11.170 --> 16:13.138
[Gasps]
They're here! They're here!

16:14.840 --> 16:19.504
Hiya, Homer.
I brung ya a big bag of irregular Oreos.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.506
I don't see what's wrong
with this one. Oh.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.120
Lookir for a good time, sailor?

16:39.231 --> 16:41.563
- I certainly am.
- No, you're not!

16:41.667 --> 16:43.567
He's really not.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.103
And that's how,
with a few minor adjustments...

16:46.205 --> 16:49.197
you can turn a regular gun
into five guns.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.276
[Light Applause]

16:53.812 --> 16:56.838
Here's some more
chocolate curls, gun buddies.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.418
Anyone else want a beer?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.717
Homer, you use your gun
as a can opener?

17:04.823 --> 17:06.723
I use it for everything.

17:06.825 --> 17:08.816
Watch me turn on the TV.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.794
- <i>[Gunfire]</i>
- [Grunting]

17:13.432 --> 17:17.266
I've never seen such recklessness!

17:17.368 --> 17:21.237
- You might've hurt someone!
- Are you some kind of moron?

17:21.339 --> 17:24.776
- Yeah, but-
- Hey, <i>yutz.</i> Guns aren't toys.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.335
They're for family protection,
hunting dangerous or delicious animals...

17:28.446 --> 17:30.472
and keeping the king of England
out of your face.

17:32.484 --> 17:36.716
- Your membership card please, Homer.
- Oh!

17:36.822 --> 17:39.290
I'll also need to remove your tattoo.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.723
- I didn't get one yet.
- Rats.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.954
Now, since you're
no longer a member...

17:44.063 --> 17:46.293
please go outside
until the meeting is over.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.298
[Chuckling]

17:48.400 --> 17:51.392
- <i>##[Disco]</i>
- <i>[Laughing, Chattering]</i>

17:51.503 --> 17:55.030
- Hey, we got a pool!
- Can we go swimming, Mom?

17:56.375 --> 17:58.969
Mmm, not right now, dear.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.370
Wow!
The TV's coin-operated.

18:02.481 --> 18:06.349
And so is the Bible!

18:06.452 --> 18:08.579
I'd like to order
a wake-up call, please.

18:08.687 --> 18:12.054
3:00 a.m.
Uh, for every room except this one.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.057
That's right.
Good night.

18:14.159 --> 18:17.560
[Chuckling] Always love
trying out new material on the road.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.257
<i>[Bart] No way are you gonna</i>
<i>beat me this time, Lise.</i>

18:20.365 --> 18:22.959
- [Coins Clinking]
- [Voice Wavering] Yes, I am!

18:23.068 --> 18:27.528
- Come on, Spotty!
- Come on, Smelly!

18:31.877 --> 18:35.779
<i>[Gunfire]</i>

18:40.719 --> 18:43.085
Oh! This gun cost me everything-

18:43.188 --> 18:45.088
my wife, my kids.

18:45.190 --> 18:49.092
Everything but my precious, precious gun.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.424
<i>[Gunshot]</i>

18:51.530 --> 18:54.761
This stinks.
I want my family back.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.268
Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?

18:58.370 --> 18:59.894
[Male Voice]
No. Go back to sleep.

19:00.005 --> 19:03.634
This bed is making me nauseous!

19:03.742 --> 19:05.642
Why won't it stop?

19:05.744 --> 19:09.077
Honey, it'll be morning soon.
Try to get some sleep.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.376
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- [Gasps]

19:11.483 --> 19:15.044
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
Are you planning to stay the whole night?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.748
- Yes!
- All right.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.756
Vote Quimby.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.225
- Marge?
- <i>[Man Groans]</i>

19:25.330 --> 19:27.230
- Sorry. Marge?
- <i>[Woman Gasps]</i>

19:27.332 --> 19:30.028
- Oh. Sorry. Marge?
- <i>[Mayor Quimby] Vote Quimby.</i>

19:30.135 --> 19:32.433
- Sorry.
- [Marge] Down here, Homer!

19:32.538 --> 19:36.099
Oh, Marge, there's so many things
I wanna yell to you!

19:36.208 --> 19:38.005
Come down here!

19:38.110 --> 19:40.010
Okay!

19:40.112 --> 19:43.343
Oh, honey, please come home.
I need you.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.848
It's dark in the house
and I'm hungry and lonesome...

19:45.951 --> 19:48.852
and there's no one there to hear
my various witty remarks.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.151
- What about the gun?
- It's gone for good, Marge.

19:52.257 --> 19:55.988
I finally realized, what's the point
of having a gun for protection...

19:56.094 --> 19:57.994
if you've got no one to protect?

19:58.096 --> 20:00.963
Oh, Homie.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.966
Mmm!

20:03.068 --> 20:05.502
Come on, kids.
We're goir home.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.504
<i>[Together]</i>
<i>Yea!</i>

20:10.742 --> 20:12.642
Okeydoke.
Here's your bill...

20:12.744 --> 20:15.304
and your continental breakfast.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.382
[Coughing]

20:20.719 --> 20:22.619
All right, everybody, hands up!

20:22.721 --> 20:24.951
You, give me the cash drawer.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.582
Do what he says.
I'm too rich to die.

20:28.760 --> 20:32.287
Freeze, bad guy!

20:32.397 --> 20:36.197
- Vote Quimby!
- Okay, man. Don't shoot. Chill.

20:36.301 --> 20:41.500
Homer, you said you got rid of the gun!
You lied to me again!

20:41.607 --> 20:44.804
- I know I said that,
but what I secretly meant was-
- Yoink!

20:44.910 --> 20:46.935
[Sinister Laughter]

20:47.045 --> 20:50.071
The joke's on you, buddy.
There's no bullets in that thing.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.446
- [Rattling]
- [Laughing]

20:52.551 --> 20:54.451
Yo, give me the bullets.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.716
- Okay. Don't shoot!
- [All] Drop it!

21:00.659 --> 21:02.490
Bye!

21:02.594 --> 21:04.755
How did you know
we were being robbed?

21:04.863 --> 21:08.355
The clerk here pressed the silent alarm,
and we picked it up on our scanner.

21:08.467 --> 21:12.301
- Did anyone stop that robber?
- No, I don't think so.

21:14.906 --> 21:16.931
I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge...

21:17.042 --> 21:19.272
but this gun had a hold on me.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.903
I felt this incredible
surge of power...

21:22.014 --> 21:24.710
like God must feel
when he's holding a gun.

21:24.816 --> 21:29.981
So please, get rid of it, because I know
I'll just lie to you again and again.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.433
Hmm!

22:39.491 --> 22:41.789
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
