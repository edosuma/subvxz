00:13.713 --> 00:15.044
An S.

00:15.281 --> 00:17.613
How exactly did you come up
with this, Clark?

00:17.817 --> 00:19.045
It's for Smallville High.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.653
Thought the school logo
could use an update.

00:21.821 --> 00:24.187
Your form could use a little function.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.521
I told you. Stick with the basics.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.564
You can't miss with a candlestick holder.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.195
You call this a letter opener?

00:38.371 --> 00:42.865
Poorly cast, shoddy workmanship.
I expected better from you, Ian.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.136
You're not gonna
grade me down, are you?

00:46.112 --> 00:48.580
I'm gonna give you the grade you deserve.

00:48.748 --> 00:51.114
But I did the work.
I came to every class.

00:51.351 --> 00:55.583
Attendance isn't everything.
There's also attitude and effort.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.892
That's it. Good work, most of you.

01:06.699 --> 01:09.259
Grades will be posted Thursday.

01:13.339 --> 01:16.570
Clark, how about a sneak preview?

01:17.277 --> 01:19.643
Come on, man. I'm not gonna tell your dad.

01:33.426 --> 01:38.125
So? Come on, man.
Don't keep me in suspense. How'd I do?

01:39.666 --> 01:41.463
You were smart to stick to the basics.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.977
What's bugging him?

01:52.145 --> 01:56.844
Let's just say that Ian's legendary 4.0
took a hit. I saw his grade.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.747
His name's right above yours
in Frankel's book.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.615
That's too bad. Kid's an academic dynamo.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.555
But keep loading up on night classes and
extracurriculars, something's gotta give.

02:06.726 --> 02:07.954
Yeah.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.400
Ian.

02:18.905 --> 02:21.703
I need an A in this class.

02:25.678 --> 02:29.307
Mr. Frankel, we need to talk
about my grade.

02:29.682 --> 02:33.209
I told you, it'll be posted on Thursday.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.378
No, I need to know now.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.758
It's a C. And frankly, that was generous.

02:39.926 --> 02:43.259
Wait, that's not fair. I work twice as hard
as anybody at this school...

02:43.429 --> 02:47.331
...and I need a perfect 4.0 to lock down
the Luthor Foundation scholarship.

02:48.635 --> 02:52.230
That grade is final, Ian,
and this conversation is over.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.742
Ian, what the hell is this?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.913
I'm calling the police!

03:18.331 --> 03:20.424
I just can't accept a C.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.916
Yes, I'm aware I'm late.

04:16.089 --> 04:20.389
Look, make my apologies to the EPA rep
and start the plant tour without me.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.586
Yes, I still plan on being in Metropolis
for the charity auction.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.254
Excuse me. I've been here
less than five minutes.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.668
Yeah, wouldn't want you to miss
your tee time.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.901
These are for a charity auction.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.171
So you'll give away a $4000-dollar
set of golf clubs...

04:41.381 --> 04:44.817
...but you'll gripe over a $25
parking ticket.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.716
I'm sorry, have I done something
to offend you?

04:51.691 --> 04:54.922
It's always the rich ones that put up a stink.

04:59.866 --> 05:02.266
Some of us actually work for a living.

05:05.004 --> 05:07.598
Watch where you park your car
in the future...

05:09.976 --> 05:11.603
...Lex.

05:24.624 --> 05:25.921
Hey!

05:27.160 --> 05:28.650
Are you crazy?

05:28.828 --> 05:31.820
I employ 2500 people in this town.

05:32.598 --> 05:37.035
Who all pay taxes,
which provide your salary.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.235
Get a real job.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.976
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.751
- More?
- I know. Just a couple more boxes.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.856
Thanks for letting me live with you,
Mr. Sullivan.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.257
- It really, really means a lot.
- You're welcome.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.488
In honor of the day,
I'm gonna make dinner.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.362
- Oh, hey, don't put yourself out.
- Mi casa es su casserole.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.767
- So how you feeling?
- Excited and terrified at the same time...

06:14.941 --> 06:16.306
...if that makes any sense.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.500
Well, it is a big change.

06:19.145 --> 06:21.978
Huge, and not just for me.
Even though she agreed to it...

06:22.148 --> 06:25.049
...Nell was kind of upset that I decided
to stay in Smallville.

06:26.085 --> 06:29.521
It's not easy when someone you love
moves away.

06:39.165 --> 06:44.068
So that looks like it's everything,
if you need to get your truck back.

06:45.304 --> 06:48.535
I lucked out. My mom called and said
she was gonna take off early...

06:48.708 --> 06:51.176
...help finish up the chores.
You wanna celebrate?

06:51.344 --> 06:54.677
I wish I could, but I've gotta get changed
and take a shift at the Talon.

06:54.847 --> 07:00.183
I only have a second to grab a bite before
I need to run over to the Torch. Sorry.

07:01.020 --> 07:04.319
Well, when you two are scheduled
to take a breath, give me a call.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.390
- Will do.
- Thanks, Clark.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.923
Yeah.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.323
Bye.

07:11.297 --> 07:13.390
This is gonna be so great.

07:29.415 --> 07:33.909
Well, looks like it's just you and me,
old girl.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.519
Come on.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.465
Come on, you.

08:01.914 --> 08:05.350
Mom? Dad?

08:05.518 --> 08:07.247
Anyone home?

08:07.420 --> 08:11.151
- Clark! Clark!
- Dad.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.749
Dad?

08:20.032 --> 08:21.829
I can't move my leg.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.800
It's broken. Hold on.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.081
Oh, sorry, the door was open. I'm lan.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.480
Randall. Yeah, I know.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.918
You practically own the library table
by the math and science shelves.

08:44.090 --> 08:47.890
Yeah, and you've staked out carrel 17,
current events.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.463
Guess we're both candidates for
the Overachievers Anonymous Club.

08:52.632 --> 08:56.591
Yeah. So, what brings you to my
stressed-out part of the world?

08:57.036 --> 09:00.733
Well, actually, I had heard that most
of the library's reference books...

09:00.907 --> 09:03.034
...had migrated over to this side
of the building.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.370
Oh, right. I've been meaning
to return these...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.537
But just couldn't find the time.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.877
Exactly. Days like this,
I could really use two of me.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.144
Are you getting started early as well?

09:16.455 --> 09:20.357
No, actually, I'm planning on graduating
at the end of this school year.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.924
But you're only a sophomore.

09:23.095 --> 09:26.929
Yeah, but I've been piling on night classes,
extra-credit work.

09:27.099 --> 09:30.796
If I can land the Luthor Scholarship,
I'll be going Ivy League next year.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.438
Color me journalistically intrigued.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.479
How about an interview?

09:42.982 --> 09:45.246
Okay. All right.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.819
But take it easy on me.
Your reputation precedes you.

09:50.323 --> 09:54.384
I have a feeling I'll be able to leave my
hard-hitting reporter hat at home this time...

09:54.560 --> 09:57.028
...so don't worry.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.997
Is he gonna be all right?

10:05.171 --> 10:07.435
I don't see him square-dancing
in the near term...

10:07.607 --> 10:10.098
...but if he stays off the leg,
he should heal fine.

10:10.343 --> 10:14.507
- Oh, my God. Jonathan.
- Stop. Martha, I'm gonna be fine.

10:14.714 --> 10:18.548
His doctor agrees. As soon as I can find you
a pair of crutches, you're good to go.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.083
Thank you.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.585
Where've you been?
I left a message an hour ago.

10:26.759 --> 10:30.627
I was in a closed-door teleconference
between Lionel and the LuthorCorp board.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.459
- I wish you'd waited for me.
- I did wait for you. I waited over an hour.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.194
I'm sorry. I tried to call,
but the machine was on.

10:37.370 --> 10:41.306
What's done is done. I would just really
like to get out of here. Now, please?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.068
- I'll pack up your stuff.
- Okay.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.942
I'm really sorry.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.608
I know.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.348
I'm looking for a Dr. Bryce.

10:55.521 --> 10:56.988
You found her.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.522
Yes, I'm a friend of Jonathan Kent's.

10:59.692 --> 11:02.957
I've placed a call to my father's personal
orthopedist in Metropolis.

11:03.129 --> 11:06.121
Any complications, he can be flown
out here within the hour.

11:06.699 --> 11:10.465
A broken leg is nothing to sneeze at, but
there's no reason to summon the cavalry.

11:10.636 --> 11:14.128
- I just want him to get the best care.
- So do I.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.606
I've offended you.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.980
I'm second-guessed for a living, Mr. Luthor.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.616
It comes with the territory.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.917
Lex, what's going on?

11:29.088 --> 11:32.353
Mr. Luthor and I were just discussing
the state of small-town medicine.

11:39.498 --> 11:42.490
- How's your dad?
- He's okay.

11:42.668 --> 11:46.764
It's my mom I'm worried about.
She blames herself for the accident.

11:46.939 --> 11:50.067
Well, your mom's taken on a lot
and she's trying to find a balance.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.107
Believe me, it's not always that easy.

11:53.679 --> 11:58.378
Guess I'm just lucky she didn't take
a 9-iron to a meter maid's car.

12:00.419 --> 12:04.583
- You heard about that.
- The town is called Smallville.

12:04.757 --> 12:09.490
- I was having a bad day.
- Yeah.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.330
- I can do it. I can do it.
- Thank you.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.470
Thank you. No, I'm fine.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.206
- Oh, God. All right.
- Just take it easy.

12:26.178 --> 12:30.945
So perfect attendance, straight A's and a
class load that would make Einstein crack.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.278
Forget the interview. Let's just call Ripley's.

12:33.452 --> 12:37.411
- It's kind of intense, huh?
- That's like saying the sun is kind of hot.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.353
I think it's an only-child thing.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.755
Part of me always wants to do
twice as much...

12:41.927 --> 12:44.555
...make up for the children
my parents never had.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.459
As an only myself, I understand.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.226
Though I'll never get this mad rush
to graduate.

12:49.401 --> 12:54.100
Well, I just know there's more to life than
Smallville. And I can't wait to take it on.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.264
You and me both.

12:58.377 --> 13:00.174
You are on a deadline, right?

13:00.346 --> 13:05.010
Oh, yeah. One of the drawbacks
of actually enjoying yourself.

13:05.184 --> 13:07.277
Time flies.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.547
Well, you know, if you want,
maybe I could tag along.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.658
We could do something
when you're through.

13:13.826 --> 13:16.226
Great. Yeah, I would love that.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.101
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hi, Clark.

13:24.370 --> 13:29.273
You remember lan, the amazing lan.
We were just finishing up.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.740
- Yeah, I'll grab the check.
- Okay, I'll grab the car.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.544
Meet you outside in five.

13:37.850 --> 13:40.751
Ian. Frankel gave you
a pretty hard time today, huh?

13:40.920 --> 13:42.945
Yeah, well, his bark's worse than his bite.

13:43.122 --> 13:47.058
I caught him in the hall after class,
he said I definitely nailed the A.

13:47.226 --> 13:50.093
Really? That's good for you.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.127
Thank God. I thought you'd
forgotten about our math session.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.561
That's why I'm here.

13:54.733 --> 13:57.827
With my dad out of commission,
I have to make the feed store run.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.903
Okay. Yeah, I understand.

14:01.240 --> 14:05.301
So. Simultaneous equations
giving you grief?

14:05.477 --> 14:07.911
Higher math and I don't seem
to get along very well.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.983
Yeah, I suffered through algebra last term.
If you want, I can give you a few tips.

14:13.152 --> 14:16.679
Are you serious?
Because I am totally lost.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.848
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
When's a good time?

14:20.059 --> 14:22.027
I'm off in 10 minutes.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.628
Great.

14:25.497 --> 14:28.762
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thanks.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.200
You okay, Clark?

14:36.075 --> 14:37.906
Yep.

14:39.845 --> 14:42.439
- I'd better go.
- All right.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.078
Hey, lan. Hop in.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.414
- Come on.
- Oh, great car.

15:58.023 --> 16:01.117
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

16:01.293 --> 16:06.128
- Thanks, lan. You're a lifesaver.
- Trust me. There's no place I'd rather be.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.498
Dad, aren't you supposed to be
taking it easy?

16:15.674 --> 16:18.507
I am taking it easy.
I slept in till 6, didn't I?

16:18.677 --> 16:21.669
Besides, I've gotta go out
and feed and water the cattle.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.576
Done.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.381
Really?

16:26.719 --> 16:29.745
- Well, did you clean out the...
- Chicken coop?

16:29.922 --> 16:33.085
Dad, I took care of it, don't worry.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.722
Good morning.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.590
Mom, you're not dressed for work.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.824
I thought I would stay home today.
Just until things settle down.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.198
Sweetheart, I don't want my accident
to disrupt this whole family.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.965
Dad, the couch is over there.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.836
Clark, believe me.
I can take it just as easy...

16:51.010 --> 16:55.777
...greasing the bearings on the tractor out
in the barn as I can sitting on that couch.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.893
Mom, you can't blame yourself
for Dad's accident.

17:12.064 --> 17:14.055
This farm is supposed to be a partnership.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.964
But ever since I've been working with
Lionel, I haven't been able to do my share.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.402
You took that job to help the farm.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.836
No one expects you to be in two places
at once.

17:23.008 --> 17:26.204
No, but I should try to be where I'm needed.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.920
How's that for weird?
Frankel's never even missed a class before.

17:37.089 --> 17:40.252
Looks like the metal-shop impaired
caught a break today.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.724
I'm glad you scoped out my grade.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.126
Hey, check out Lana's new study buddy.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.802
Yeah.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.234
Do I detect a hint of the J-word?

17:54.406 --> 17:58.740
- No, Lana and I are just friends.
- Right.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.413
Thanks. I really appreciate this, Lana.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.246
Your peer recommendation's gonna carry
a lot of weight with Lex Luthor.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.857
Anyone who can help me with double-angle
functions deserves a scholarship.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.003
Well, I'll talk to you later. Page me.

18:32.578 --> 18:35.843
Looks like the study date went well.

18:36.014 --> 18:41.714
Yeah, lan showed me this great shortcut
and after that, the study part was over.

18:43.122 --> 18:47.058
Ian's really intense.
You know, in a good way.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.319
We're getting together again tonight.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.990
- More studying?
- Actually, we're gonna go see a movie.

18:55.167 --> 18:58.034
- What does Chloe think?
- What do you mean?

18:58.203 --> 19:00.433
You saw her and lan at the Talon last night.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.666
- Yeah, they were doing an interview.
- No...

19:03.842 --> 19:06.037
...they were gonna go on a date.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.305
He bailed on her to help you
with your algebra homework.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.281
Chloe and I were unpacking for an hour
last night, she didn't say a word.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.783
Lana, I swear, they...

19:14.987 --> 19:19.185
Listen, this move's been tough enough.
And Chloe and her dad have been great.

19:19.358 --> 19:24.421
So please, if you don't have any facts,
just stay out of it.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.919
Dr. Bryce?

19:53.992 --> 19:56.517
Mr. Luthor.

19:58.263 --> 20:02.222
- Like your nametag.
- It's my secret identity. Don't tell anyone.

20:02.601 --> 20:07.095
Gotta admit, you are the last person
I expected to see here today.

20:08.273 --> 20:13.301
- What are you here for?
- I drop-kicked an orderly.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.843
I have a violent reaction to incompetence.

20:19.017 --> 20:22.248
Drop-kick must have caught him off guard.

20:22.421 --> 20:27.085
So, what'd you do?
Verbally demean your butler?

20:27.259 --> 20:32.458
Cute. I took a 9-iron
to a meter maid's car.

20:32.631 --> 20:38.900
Now I'm really jealous. I've always
wanted to do that. How'd it feel?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.561
Great.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.436
Word of advice,
keep that to yourself in here.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.039
Wanna get together after class?
Grab something...

20:49.214 --> 20:50.442
No.

20:50.616 --> 20:54.211
- Got a thing about dating classmates?
- No, I've got a thing about dating you.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.149
Why?

20:58.257 --> 21:01.715
You don't remember me, do you?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.986
If everyone could please take their seats...

21:15.874 --> 21:17.535
- Chloe?
- Yeah.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.769
- Got a second?
- Sure.

21:22.748 --> 21:27.447
"Primed to graduate two years early,
Ian Randall is a true academic superstar."

21:27.619 --> 21:29.883
Well, so much for journalistic detachment.

21:30.055 --> 21:33.718
Believe it or not, not every story
has to be Wall of Weird material.

21:33.892 --> 21:36.588
Why am I defending myself?

21:36.762 --> 21:39.094
Do you like him?

21:39.264 --> 21:43.394
I don't not like him.
What is this about, Clark?

21:43.568 --> 21:45.559
Nothing, I just want you to be careful.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.602
Why?

21:47.939 --> 21:50.066
Look, I probably shouldn't say anything...

21:50.242 --> 21:54.702
...but I saw him and Lana in the hallway
and they seemed pretty close.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.108
Oh, I get it.

21:56.281 --> 22:00.684
You just wanna make sure that poor little
Chloe doesn't get burned. Again.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.717
- No. Chloe...
- You know what, Clark?

22:02.888 --> 22:06.346
Not that it matters, but Ian already
told me Lana was kind of into him...

22:06.558 --> 22:08.321
...but he'd rather be with me.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.985
He asked me to keep it a secret because
he doesn't wanna hurt her feelings.

22:12.464 --> 22:13.692
And you believe that?

22:16.134 --> 22:19.661
You really can't imagine that someone
would choose me over Lana, can you?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.936
Chloe, wait...

22:34.920 --> 22:37.548
Ian, we need to talk.

22:37.723 --> 22:41.523
- Later, Clark, I'm busy.
- Now. It's about Chloe and Lana.

22:41.727 --> 22:43.752
I know you're playing them off each other.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.556
Must have learned from the master.

22:46.331 --> 22:48.060
What does that mean?

22:48.233 --> 22:52.533
Chloe told me how you dumped her
the day after spring formal.

22:52.704 --> 22:57.937
And Lana said you send off so many
mixed signals you could scramble a radar.

22:59.578 --> 23:02.308
Maybe they'd rather be with a guy
who's going someplace.

23:02.481 --> 23:05.541
You know, after I get my scholarship,
I am out of this hick town.

23:05.817 --> 23:07.717
So you don't care about them at all,
do you?

23:07.886 --> 23:10.081
You're using them to get your scholarship.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.723
Chloe writes you the big article and
Lana gives you the fast track to Lex.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.757
I never said that.

23:15.927 --> 23:17.224
Why don't you just admit it.

23:17.396 --> 23:21.890
The two girls who used to like you
now like me and you're jealous.

23:22.434 --> 23:26.632
It's gonna be hard to keep your 4.0
when Frankel gave you a C.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.367
I never saw any grades posted.

23:33.545 --> 23:38.005
It's pretty weird, Frankel takes the day off.
Lucky break for you.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.612
You trying to say something?

23:44.456 --> 23:46.754
Guy took a sick day.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.957
Stay out of my life, Kent.

23:57.002 --> 24:00.494
Clark, for the record, this is messed up.
Mr. Frankel's sick.

24:00.672 --> 24:06.110
I checked with Principal Reynolds' office.
He didn't call in sick. He didn't call at all.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.406
This is the last place anyone saw Frankel.
I just wanna look around.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.446
You wanna look around,
we'll look around.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.584
But I don't know what
you think we'll find.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.720
Gonna have a little look around.
There.

24:16.354 --> 24:18.447
- Just take a look.
- I'm looking around.

24:18.623 --> 24:22.059
You happy? We looked around.
There's nothing here.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.495
What are you doing here?

25:06.771 --> 25:08.238
What's it look like?

25:08.406 --> 25:12.536
Chloe, he just tried to kill me and Pete.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.702
And I think he murdered Frankel.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.507
What is this, a joke?

25:16.681 --> 25:19.650
Yeah, Clark. When did this
deadly encounter occur?

25:19.818 --> 25:22.378
Twenty minutes ago. I came right over.

25:22.554 --> 25:27.048
- Okay, stop, that's impossible.
- Why?

25:27.225 --> 25:30.717
Because I've been here for the last
three hours, Clark.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.145
Lana, have you seen Chloe?

25:54.319 --> 25:56.753
She's at the sheriff station
giving her statement.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.049
I don't remember ordering
a side of hostility.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.292
I can't believe you accused Ian
of murdering Mr. Frankel.

26:02.694 --> 26:06.824
Lana, you have to believe me. I don't know
how he did it, but he's lying to everyone.

26:07.132 --> 26:09.896
A boy with secrets. I'm surprised
you're not fast friends.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.729
Don't try to turn this around on me.

26:11.903 --> 26:15.498
He's seeing you and Chloe both.
He was at her house, she's his alibi.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.904
Clark, they were finishing up an interview.

26:18.076 --> 26:22.069
Does Chloe always finish up her interviews
by making out with her subjects?

26:23.348 --> 26:26.909
Ian told me that Chloe had a little
crush on him but it wasn't serious.

26:27.085 --> 26:30.248
And he told you not to say anything
to Chloe about it, didn't he?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.754
Lana, he said the same thing
to Chloe about you.

26:35.460 --> 26:41.296
If this is all because I enjoy spending time
with Ian, then you are way overreacting.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.457
I'd say you were jealous.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.661
No, Lana, I'm trying to be your friend.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.328
Look, you gotta ask yourself...

26:48.506 --> 26:51.942
...what kind of person asks the two people
he cares about to lie for him?

27:07.459 --> 27:13.329
Metropolis General. I was drunk,
puking my guts out in the ER.

27:13.498 --> 27:17.059
You were the first-year med student
assigned to sober me up.

27:17.235 --> 27:20.033
It's a night I'll never forget either.

27:20.939 --> 27:24.932
- Guess I owe you a belated thank-you.
- Actually, I should be thanking you.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.273
It's cases like yours that convinced me
to leave Metropolis.

27:30.015 --> 27:35.647
I'm flattered I turned you from nose jobs
and liposuction to small-town medicine.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.046
Your father is Stanley Bryce, right?

27:38.223 --> 27:40.691
Plastic surgeon to the Metropolis
rich and famous?

27:40.859 --> 27:42.793
Somebody's been doing his homework.

27:42.961 --> 27:44.292
You intrigue me, Helen.

27:44.462 --> 27:47.295
Suddenly we're on a first-name basis, Lex?

27:47.465 --> 27:49.933
Don't worry, I won't give up
your secret identity.

27:50.101 --> 27:54.197
For the record, I refused to join my father's
practice and we stopped speaking.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.163
They hate when you do that.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.140
Sounds like you speak from experience.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.710
You witnessed my self-destructive phase.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.873
Then I almost let my father die. Now I'm
just trying to beat him at his own game.

28:06.051 --> 28:09.885
- How's that going?
- I terrorize meter maids.

28:10.055 --> 28:16.324
Yeah. I drop-kick orderlies. It's funny,
I was never an angry child.

28:19.297 --> 28:21.561
I'll see you in class.

28:27.138 --> 28:29.333
I'm off in 10 minutes.

28:31.976 --> 28:35.412
If you wanted to go do something.

28:45.023 --> 28:48.288
Clark, I got your 911.
I assume we're back on the Ian trail?

28:48.460 --> 28:50.485
I got lan's scholarship information
from Lex.

28:50.662 --> 28:53.290
He was taking classes
at Smallville Community College...

28:53.465 --> 28:55.865
...at the exact same time he was
at Smallville High.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.631
Any idea how an only child can make like
the Olsen twins?

28:58.803 --> 29:02.739
"How" isn't important. I wanna make sure
we're right before throwing around charges.

29:02.941 --> 29:06.900
Yeah, well, I wouldn't look for much help
in our Lana and Chloe department.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.608
Maybe I can. Doesn't lan carry a pager?

29:19.457 --> 29:21.755
- Hey, lan.
- Mr. Sullivan, hi.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.760
- Is Chloe here?
- No, I'm afraid she's not home.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.161
I don't understand. She paged me
to meet her here at 5:30.

29:29.334 --> 29:32.963
Must be some kind of mix-up. Last I heard,
she was working late at the Torch.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.639
- Okay, thanks.
- All right.

29:54.459 --> 29:59.396
- Hey, Pete, have you seen Lana?
- Not for a while. Why?

29:59.564 --> 30:03.022
Well, she paged me, said she wanted
to get together at 5:30.

30:03.201 --> 30:06.693
What can I say?
Something must have come up.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.477
Clark, Mr. Punctual made his appearance
at exactly 5:30.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.945
Which means we're definitely
seeing double.

30:18.116 --> 30:21.711
Thanks, Pete. I'll call Chloe.

30:30.895 --> 30:34.331
God, Clark. Give it a rest.

30:34.899 --> 30:39.131
Hey, lan, I will be with you
in just one second.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.269
Lana, hi. Would you...

30:44.442 --> 30:47.570
I thought that you were going home
after your shift was over.

30:48.379 --> 30:49.676
We need to talk.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.547
Okay, sure. About what?

30:53.885 --> 30:55.477
About Ian.

30:57.021 --> 31:01.390
He's... Actually, he's stopping by
to look over his article.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.995
Is that why you're wearing a new blouse?

31:06.898 --> 31:10.061
Okay, this just got incredibly awkward.

31:11.903 --> 31:15.031
Clark came by the Talon.
I know about you and lan.

31:16.608 --> 31:20.339
For a guy so concerned with privacy,
he can't seem to keep his mouth shut.

31:20.511 --> 31:24.003
This isn't about Clark. It's about us.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.348
I hated keeping it from you...

31:28.519 --> 31:32.956
...but I really like lan
and I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

31:33.124 --> 31:37.185
I don't wanna hurt your feelings either.
But I was out with lan last night too.

31:40.531 --> 31:44.228
Making me 0 for 2 in the "they always
go for Lana" sweepstakes.

31:44.402 --> 31:47.235
Chloe, he's playing us both.

31:50.141 --> 31:53.372
And I should have been honest
with you up front.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.273
Me too.

31:58.983 --> 32:00.473
Hey.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.277
Ian. What are you doing here?

32:03.454 --> 32:06.946
Well, I was looking for you.
Both of you, actually.

32:07.725 --> 32:11.092
The two-for-one special?
Ian, we know.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.996
Well, can you blame me?

32:14.165 --> 32:18.693
I mean, I enjoyed being with the two
smartest, prettiest girls in school.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.895
Together, you're almost my equal.

32:24.409 --> 32:28.072
I don't believe this.
Clark tried to warn us about you.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.915
Kent.

32:32.016 --> 32:35.543
Is that why you paged me at the same time?

32:35.720 --> 32:38.951
What are you talking about?
I never paged you.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.327
Ian, what are you doing?

32:47.532 --> 32:48.965
Securing my future.

32:51.903 --> 32:55.100
Your futures, on the other hand,
don't look so bright.

32:58.242 --> 33:00.710
Hey, girls. How about a double date?

33:07.919 --> 33:10.217
Chloe! Lana!

33:10.388 --> 33:13.118
Chloe!
Clark, check this out.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.486
"We've both been deceiving ourselves
over lan."

33:15.660 --> 33:19.494
"Now the pain's too much. We've gone
to the dam to end our suffering."

33:19.664 --> 33:21.097
Sounds like a suicide note.

33:21.265 --> 33:23.495
Ian wanted me to see that.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.569
He's gonna kill them to get to me.

33:56.934 --> 34:01.837
- Ian, don't. Please.
- I'm not gonna let you ruin my life.

34:03.207 --> 34:08.735
- Ian, you need help.
- That's what I'm doing. Helping myself.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.617
No!

34:18.022 --> 34:19.420
Chloe!

34:27.697 --> 34:31.759
- Hey, give me a hand here!
- Be there in a sec.

35:06.404 --> 35:08.304
Come on.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.235
Clark!

36:01.692 --> 36:03.751
You okay?

36:04.762 --> 36:06.957
You sure?

36:21.879 --> 36:24.245
Clark, any word on Lana and Chloe?

36:24.415 --> 36:26.280
They're shaken up, but okay.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.509
They didn't see you use your abilities?

36:28.686 --> 36:32.713
I think they were a little preoccupied
with the idea of two Ians.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.382
I thought we were done with bills
this month.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.926
We were, but I thought
I'd take another look...

36:38.095 --> 36:40.791
...and see if we could get along
without my extra paycheck.

36:40.965 --> 36:45.595
I've been thinking that I've been trying
to do too many things.

36:45.770 --> 36:49.171
- I really should stay on the farm.
- Look...

36:49.607 --> 36:52.508
I was not angry because
you weren't here.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.373
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

36:55.613 --> 36:57.706
Ever since you took this job...

36:58.082 --> 37:02.178
...things have been different between
you and me.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.584
I don't want you to quit.

37:05.756 --> 37:09.487
But you've gotta know that
it seems to me like sometimes...

37:09.660 --> 37:12.060
...the Luthors take top priority.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.026
I guess I've just gotta work through that.

37:17.568 --> 37:20.901
I really like what I'm doing, Jonathan...

37:21.072 --> 37:24.064
...but you and Clark will always come first.
You know that.

37:27.678 --> 37:29.373
Yeah.

37:38.055 --> 37:40.182
- Hey, Lana.
- Oh, hey.

37:40.358 --> 37:43.850
- How you feeling?
- Still a little freaked.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.791
Kind of stupid.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.932
Ditto. What really gets me is
I should have known better.

37:49.100 --> 37:53.537
Only Chloe Sullivan could fall for a guy
who splits himself in two.

37:53.704 --> 37:55.296
I don't know. What is it about me?

37:55.473 --> 37:57.998
Do I have a sign around my neck
that says "mutant magnet"?

37:58.175 --> 37:59.608
He fooled me too, Chloe.

38:00.711 --> 38:02.838
So much for our taste in guys.

38:04.715 --> 38:08.481
It only went as far as it did because we
weren't being honest with each other.

38:08.653 --> 38:12.589
- So no more secrets, okay?
- Okay.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.692
I'm gonna finish the laundry because
I'm cooking dinner tonight.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.761
- Lana, you don't have to do that.
- Oh, I don't mind.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.329
You're not a glorified guest.
This is your house too...

38:21.499 --> 38:25.060
...and we're not gonna kick you out
if there's evidence you actually live here.

38:25.236 --> 38:28.797
I guess after my parents and Nell,
I've got a few abandonment issues.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.373
I went through the same thing
when my mom walked out.

38:31.542 --> 38:33.476
I was afraid my dad was
gonna leave too.

38:33.811 --> 38:37.838
But he sat me down and said I didn't have
to earn the right to be part of this family.

38:38.015 --> 38:39.346
Neither do you.

38:41.285 --> 38:46.018
- Thanks, Chloe.
- Sure. Now, let's go over the house rules.

38:46.190 --> 38:47.987
Okay, and they are?

38:48.159 --> 38:50.957
One, do not make your bed
until after 5 p.m.

38:51.128 --> 38:55.360
Two, don't touch the dishes in the sink
until it's overflowing.

38:55.533 --> 38:58.866
And three, contrary to my dad's
protestations...

38:59.036 --> 39:02.369
...your bedroom floor is definitely a closet.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.731
- Okay.
- Okay?

39:17.088 --> 39:18.988
Got your message.
Is everything all right?

39:19.423 --> 39:21.084
We've been up all night talking.

39:21.258 --> 39:23.726
And you were the number-one topic
of discussion.

39:25.262 --> 39:26.524
This can't be good.

39:26.931 --> 39:30.833
Actually, we wanted to apologize to you
for the way we've been treating you.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.765
Even though you did technically
use us as bait.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.307
I didn't count on it getting out of control.

39:37.475 --> 39:40.842
The point is, you warned us about Ian
and we didn't listen.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.212
Yeah, you thought I was jealous.

39:44.415 --> 39:47.282
There's a lot of water under the bridge
between us, Clark.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.620
I know you each have issues with me,
but you have to understand that...

39:51.789 --> 39:53.518
...I would never let anyone hurt you.

39:54.558 --> 39:57.220
We know that, Clark.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.489
I find it interesting you gave
Ian all the latitude in the world...

40:00.664 --> 40:02.859
...and I would just be
immediately dismissed.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.534
After all the times you've been
less than honest...

40:06.704 --> 40:09.138
...can you really blame us
for having some doubts?

40:09.306 --> 40:11.399
You want honesty?

40:12.009 --> 40:14.944
The truth is that I expected more
from both of you.

40:17.181 --> 40:19.445
And we expected more from you.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.086
We made a mistake.
But it was ours to make.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.062
So, what do we do now?

40:36.233 --> 40:40.169
Well, first we can stop treating me
like the jealous boyfriend.

40:40.337 --> 40:42.805
Since none of us have actually dated.

40:42.973 --> 40:45.339
If you wanna be friends, let's be friends.

40:47.144 --> 40:49.476
Is that what you really want?

40:49.647 --> 40:52.138
Yeah, it is.

40:59.523 --> 41:00.990
Good night.
