WEBVTT

00:19.936 --> 00:21.563
You'll clean them up, right?

00:21.646 --> 00:23.231
And the wristbands?

00:24.190 --> 00:25.817
Here, I'll put them on in a second.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.654
Don't be stupid, the wristbands
are never to be removed.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.157
If they find out, you'll get fired.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.411
You do remember which one's which, right?

00:39.330 --> 00:40.540
Yes… Yes.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.168
Well, then put them on.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.252
Yes.

00:53.011 --> 00:56.139
Eenie, meenie, miny, mo,
catch a tiger by the toe.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.516
Okay.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.852
Hello, Regina.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.439
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:01.913 --> 02:03.456
No, no, no!

02:03.540 --> 02:05.250
But… I let you know.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.836
I told you I was going
to the women's rights march.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.964
-That can't count as absence.
-Still, you missed my class.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.382
But for a good cause.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.968
Or don't you think
women have the right to protest?

02:15.802 --> 02:18.513
If you want to be a mathematician,
my class is important.

02:18.596 --> 02:19.806
Stop skipping class.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.058
Sorry, I've been busy with…

02:22.142 --> 02:23.184
something else.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.520
Or aren't we entitled
to get pregnant either?

02:25.603 --> 02:27.605
You lost the right to take the test.

02:28.106 --> 02:31.442
I was clear at the beginning
of the semester, ten absences maximum.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.866
Damn oppressive macho.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.537
Suck it up, and hurry
to the test you are allowed to take--

02:42.620 --> 02:44.247
What, Mariana? Are you okay?

02:44.330 --> 02:48.168
No, I'm having a hell of a contraction.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.171
Wait, wait.

02:52.088 --> 02:52.964
It's gone.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.134
Oh, boy!

02:57.719 --> 02:58.845
Damn it.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.097
Did you pee?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.807
I think my water broke.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.225
You're shitting me!

03:04.309 --> 03:06.769
-And why here, dude?
-I don't know, dude.

03:06.853 --> 03:07.687
Okay!

03:08.730 --> 03:10.148
Okay, all right now…

03:10.231 --> 03:12.358
Exhale, exhale, relax, breathe.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.071
Our products are top quality.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.326
And they're produced
using cutting-edge technology.

03:21.951 --> 03:26.456
And I, personally, make sure
we build a relationship with our clients

03:26.539 --> 03:29.417
so as to ensure
stock availability at all times.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.381
So, shipping product to Japan
won't be a problem.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.097
Ana?

03:44.098 --> 03:45.558
You're leaking.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.692
Careful, Yumiko, someone spilled water.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.196
Though they say water
is good for feng shui, huh?

03:58.279 --> 03:59.197
That's Chinese.

03:59.864 --> 04:00.949
What's Chinese?

04:01.032 --> 04:01.866
Feng shui.

04:06.746 --> 04:10.833
Just fill the tub with warm water.
You called the gas company, right?

04:10.917 --> 04:14.462
Yes, I called them, but you know them,
I'm not sure if they'll come.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.256
Mom, you don't have money, do you?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.424
I'll pay for it, just call them.

04:19.175 --> 04:23.888
Don't forget the clean towels
and the rosemary candles I bought.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.225
And don't even think about calling
that idiot Pablo.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.852
-Promise you won't call him.
-Stop, calm down.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.563
I won't tell him.
I'll see you in a bit, okay? Bye.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.360
Come on!

04:39.821 --> 04:41.489
There you go, okay.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.573
I have to run.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.575
Tell the boss I'll be back later.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.869
-Please finish that half-done haircut.
-Yes.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.413
-Thank you.
-Be careful.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.831
-Yes.
-"Granny."

04:55.586 --> 04:56.921
Call my OB-GYN.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.717
Text my stylist, Jason,
and Frank, the photographer.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.553
Then call my husband
and put him through, okay?

05:04.512 --> 05:06.889
And not a word about this.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.975
Got it? Both of you?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.186
Juan Carlos can't know I'm working.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.025
Don't judge me, Ramón.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.693
No, ma'am, not at all.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.070
When I got pregnant, by accident…

05:22.405 --> 05:27.618
I promised my husband I'd stop working
for a year, if we had this girl.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.663
Because I wasn't there for the first two
and…

05:30.747 --> 05:34.042
Why am I sharing intimate details
with the two of you?

05:34.542 --> 05:35.877
It must be the hormones.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.046
Call him, okay? Call him now.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.844
What's up, Ana?

05:45.762 --> 05:47.597
What? I'm on my way!

05:49.349 --> 05:50.391
Don't worry, man.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.559
You are the father.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.645
Tere, Mariana
hasn't taken my calls in three months.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.732
-Do you think she'll let me see the girl?
-Of course.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.276
Just don't show up while she's in labor,

06:00.360 --> 06:03.154
that's when we want to kill
the guy that knocked us up.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.990
It's Elena's fault.
Since she hooked up with Mariana--

06:06.074 --> 06:08.785
The whole lesbian thing
is just a phase we go through.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.203
She'll get over it.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.330
-I'll call you when the girl is born.
-Great.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.539
-Okay. Bye.
-Thank you.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.959
I'm about to become a dad, fuckers!

06:17.043 --> 06:19.337
-Congrats!
-Dad, dad!

06:19.420 --> 06:21.381
A dad, dude!

06:32.517 --> 06:34.102
What do you mean he's in Tulum?

06:35.186 --> 06:37.939
No, you don't get it, miss.
I'm about to give birth!

06:38.523 --> 06:42.068
I don't want another doctor.
I want him, Julio, my doctor!

06:43.653 --> 06:47.573
Judging by your rate of contractions,
you're about to give birth.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.076
Ramón, how much longer to the hospital?

06:50.159 --> 06:52.829
According to Waze, one hour fifty,
but I highly doubt it.

06:52.912 --> 06:53.788
Oh, unbelievable!

06:55.915 --> 06:59.919
I don't care what Waze says.
I'm giving birth at the best hospital,

07:00.002 --> 07:02.422
even if it means I have to close my legs.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.006
This can't be happening.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.974
Roger, what a surprise.
I was just thinking about you.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.018
Oh, I'm glad to hear that, Tere.
You know why?

07:16.102 --> 07:19.188
You have to pay the rent now
or I'll be forced to evict you.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.441
You're being nasty.
Why are you being like that?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.609
I always dye your gray hair for you.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.112
Plus, I've seen girls
hanging out by your place.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.990
Bad boy! I'll get jealous.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.283
No, I mean it, Tere.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.161
The owner's on my back.
I need you to pay the rent.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.162
Oh, my darling!

07:34.245 --> 07:36.289
-Come in, how are you? Yes, yes.
-Tere.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.374
-Tere, no, wait…
-Yes, I'll call you.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.792
Thank you, love. Bye!

07:40.543 --> 07:41.836
How are you feeling?

07:41.919 --> 07:44.422
-What did he want?
-To fix his gray hair. Are you okay?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.215
-Did the gas people come?
-No.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.469
Don't worry, the tub is almost ready,
water's warm. Elena!

07:49.552 --> 07:52.138
Get the rosemary candles
from the linen closet.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.433
You're going to be a mom!
I can't believe it!

07:55.516 --> 07:57.810
-Yes. I'll go change, okay?
-Right.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.647
Yes, and to think 22 years ago
you were my baby.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.109
And now, look at us, we could be sisters.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.282
That's strange.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.451
They say no one's registered to that name.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.204
Maybe she stopped somewhere
to get a blowout.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.705
You know Mom,

08:17.788 --> 08:19.832
she always has to look stunning.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.419
I don't think so, Jason and Ronald
are here, she only trusts them.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.132
-Isn't she at the office?
-No way, she's not working.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.636
Siri, how do I deliver a baby
in a car without an epidural?

08:31.719 --> 08:34.931
Cynthia, Siri has never been in labor,
don't ask her.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.767
Ma'am, there's a hospital nearby.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.060
No, Ramón, no…

08:39.143 --> 08:41.229
No, I can't have my baby
in this neighborhood.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.564
My girls were born here.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.902
Take this girl out of me!

08:47.985 --> 08:50.530
Now, please!

08:51.531 --> 08:52.740
Move, asshole!

08:56.827 --> 08:59.038
I couldn't get out in time.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.082
You can help her while I get there.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.042
Fuck no, Mom, I can't do this alone!

09:03.125 --> 09:05.044
What if there are complications?

09:05.127 --> 09:08.297
Oh, honey, birth
is the most natural thing in the world.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.508
Don't resist.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.759
Let it flow.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.721
Let the spirit of Venus do its job.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.434
Jeez, I have no license.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.104
Oh, no, they'll take Grandma
to the impound lot!

09:23.187 --> 09:24.897
Calm down. Hang up already.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.191
Take me to a hospital. Take me now!

09:27.275 --> 09:29.694
Relax, you want to deliver here,
with candles, music.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.321
-I even got you a dolphin.
-For fuck's sake, Mom!

09:32.405 --> 09:35.366
This won't work without Grandma.
Let's go, now!

09:35.449 --> 09:38.077
-Now, now!
-Careful, be careful!

09:39.829 --> 09:42.415
-You really think she'll like it?
-Of course.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.834
-You like bowling, right?
-Yes.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.711
Well, the baby has your genes.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.046
Look, here they come.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.424
Breathe.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.679
-Fuck, what do I do?
-Go talk.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.933
Don't go, don't.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.604
Oh, you're really something, Teresa!

10:04.687 --> 10:06.814
No, love, don't get mad.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.988
Send the hospital's location
to Juan Carlos.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.157
-Yes.
-And make sure we get a suite

10:16.240 --> 10:18.075
with high-speed Internet, okay?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.620
How about an ocean-view suite?

10:22.663 --> 10:25.041
We only have shared rooms, ma'am.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.210
No, what? Can't you kick someone out?

10:29.670 --> 10:32.256
Mom, what was Pablo doing
outside the house?

10:34.508 --> 10:35.509
Mom!

10:37.219 --> 10:38.679
Answer me, Mom!

10:38.763 --> 10:40.264
How should I know, my darling?

10:40.348 --> 10:43.017
Can't he meet the baby? He's her dad.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.561
No, Mom. Pablo broke my heart.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.022
I was in love and he left me
when I needed him.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.274
-Do you think it doesn't hurt?
-Yes, love.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.444
Why does it smell like patchouli?

10:53.527 --> 10:55.112
I'll have an allergic reaction.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.742
It's Yumiko.
She has a question about the contract.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.328
-I said you'd call back.
-I'm fine, put her on.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.538
She says she'll be quick.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.665
What's up, Yumiko?

11:05.748 --> 11:09.126
The delivery date
specified in the contract,

11:09.210 --> 11:11.671
is it when it arrives in Japan
or leaves Mexico?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.464
No, it's when it arrives…

11:15.216 --> 11:17.301
Excuse me, sorry!

11:17.385 --> 11:18.803
Could you push more quietly?

11:18.886 --> 11:21.847
We are having a very important
conversation with a client.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.891
-We can't hear.
-This is no office.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.351
It's no ashram either.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.436
So, take your ugly music elsewhere.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.521
Look, ma'am…

11:28.604 --> 11:31.524
I want to deliver my girl
immersed in peace and harmony.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.817
On second thought,

11:32.900 --> 11:35.820
that will only be possible
if you vanish from this world.

11:43.911 --> 11:44.787
I died…

11:45.371 --> 11:47.123
I'm in hell, aren't I?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.667
Don't exaggerate, Ana.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.252
No, I'm not exaggerating.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.755
How am I supposed to take 
a picture with the baby in this room?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.926
What was Regina's Apgar score?

12:00.803 --> 12:01.637
Eight.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.435
-That's what they said at delivery.
-Eight? That can't be right.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.645
My kids only get tens.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.107
I guess they don't know how to score them.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.860
-No.
-And where is the girl?

12:15.943 --> 12:17.486
They took her to the nursery.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.572
Can you go get her? For the photo.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.535
Where are Roland and Jason?

12:24.618 --> 12:25.786
They're outside.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.622
They should get started with my makeup.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.666
Oh, this sucks!

12:30.750 --> 12:32.460
-Can you go get them, please?
-Yes.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.754
Hey…

12:35.921 --> 12:37.506
Why were you so far from home?

12:39.884 --> 12:41.802
It's all Waze's fault, honey.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.097
It takes you to random streets,

12:45.181 --> 12:47.600
and then you lose the signal.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.477
It starts recalculating and…

12:50.269 --> 12:51.479
Ask Ramón.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.523
Go get them, will you? For the picture.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.441
Yes.

12:58.819 --> 12:59.695
Sweetie…

13:00.362 --> 13:01.489
how do you feel?

13:02.782 --> 13:03.699
Where's Valentina?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.242
They took her to the nursery.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.328
No, Mom. I need them to bring her to me.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.872
The first couple of hours are crucial.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.792
We need skin-to-skin contact.
I have to feed her.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.795
Yes, don't worry.
I'll ask them to bring her. Relax.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.672
How are you doing, dear?

13:19.256 --> 13:22.218
Hey, that ex of yours is out there.
Did you forgive him?

13:23.844 --> 13:25.638
Well, he obviously followed us.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.264
I'll talk to him, don't worry.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.476
I'll go with you.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.437
Tere…

13:35.022 --> 13:38.317
Look, I'm really sorry
about this whole situation, but…

13:38.400 --> 13:41.987
why don't you try to be
in Mariana's shoes for a second?

13:43.113 --> 13:45.825
Of course I put myself in Mariana's shoes.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.869
If there's someone who knows 
how to be a single mom, it's me.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.663
Well, Mariana has me.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.664
Right.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.173
-Hello.
-Hi.

14:01.882 --> 14:02.716
Elena.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.343
It's for the baby.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.137
For her to get a taste
of the family sport.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.058
Can I see her now?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.144
Sorry, Mariana doesn't want you to.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.356
But I am her parent too.

14:17.439 --> 14:18.274
I know.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.776
But, what can I do?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.778
I can't betray Mariana.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.197
I hope you understand, Pablo.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.159
Will you send me a picture?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.621
To see her.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.666
I can't.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.418
Forgive me.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.670
I mean it, I'm sorry.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.180
It's your fault, Mom.
Who would ever want to have a baby here?

14:50.264 --> 14:52.683
I told you, we got lost.

14:52.766 --> 14:56.270
Ro, do me a favor.
Take that hideous vase out of my sight.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.271
I can't stand it.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.443
Jason, can we use Photoshop
to change the color, the blankets?

15:02.526 --> 15:05.446
And make it look bigger,
a bit more spacious.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.239
-No problem.
-Really? I'm glad.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.240
Here's Regina.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.076
It wasn't easy
convincing them to bring her.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.877
Hi, sweetheart!

15:21.503 --> 15:25.758
Oh, you're the cutest thing in the world.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.469
She has your eyes, honey.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.762
You think so?

15:30.512 --> 15:32.848
No, hers are prettier.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.558
Mine are swollen.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.061
Oh, my baby girl.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.901
I'll be the best mom for you, Regina.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.240
Oh, no, I ruined my makeup.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.993
Shall we take the picture?

15:53.661 --> 15:54.620
Yes.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.414
Oh, my baby girl!

16:00.918 --> 16:03.379
Oh, my beautiful baby.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.255
Latch on, baby.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.883
She's so pretty, Mom.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.009
Yes.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.221
She has your Uncle Alberto's eyes,
doesn't she?

16:12.304 --> 16:13.889
-Grayish.
-Yeah.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.518
Look at her tiny feet, so little.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.150
She's feeding.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.113
Oh, Valentina.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.703
I promise I'll be
the best mom for you, my baby.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.840
Every mom wants that.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.967
It's the hospital rules, ma'am.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.970
Try to understand, I can't leave
the baby with you all the time.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.848
We need to be together
as long as possible.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.932
Look.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.477
Milk production is directly correlated

17:00.561 --> 17:03.564
to the amount of times
you hold your baby on your breast.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.107
That's why it's so important.

17:07.401 --> 17:10.779
I don't think it's appropriate
for you to watch videos while you work.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.866
No, they're not videos.
Actually, it's a lactation app.

17:13.949 --> 17:18.078
Don't waste the nurses' time.
They have a lot of work to do here.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.914
-Do me a favor, please.
-Yes.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.125
Dress my daughter in this onesie.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.045
It was washed
with a special hypoallergenic detergent.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.214
My family and I
are allergic to regular detergent.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.091
I wasn't wasting her time.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.635
Actually, I have a baby
in the nursery too.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.472
And these bottles have been sterilized.

17:36.555 --> 17:40.225
I'll ask you to only feed my girl
with these bottles.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.811
One never knows
what germs these other babies have.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.980
-Thanks.
-Oh, come on, lady.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.607
The only germ here is you.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.527
I hope your baby doesn't turn out
like her mother, cause jeez!

17:51.820 --> 17:57.785
My Regina will have to try very hard
to be better than her mother.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.245
On the other hand, yours…
What's her name?

18:00.329 --> 18:01.163
Valentina.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.248
Valentina?

18:04.708 --> 18:05.793
Poor girl.

18:07.586 --> 18:11.507
Valentina won't have much trouble
being classier than her raggedy mother.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.009
Well, you can easily fix being raggedy.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.260
But, being a bitch…

18:15.344 --> 18:16.804
Well, if it's that easy, do it.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.097
Thanks, nurse.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.059
Oh, worse than a witch.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.563
At least we won't have to see
that woman's face anymore. Right, Vale?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.315
Oh, yes, my love.

18:28.398 --> 18:32.152
I feel sorry for her baby, having to
put up with her the rest of her life.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.487
Let's go.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.408
She was horrible.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.328
But more than horrible, obnoxious.

18:42.204 --> 18:46.166
At least we won't have to see
her face anymore. Right, baby?

18:47.167 --> 18:50.379
I don't get why Cynthia was with you
if you weren't working.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.967
We were having coffee.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.426
You know…

18:56.510 --> 18:59.138
catching up on all the office gossip.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.891
The chip must be faulty.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.269
Uh… Is there a payment plan?

19:05.352 --> 19:07.688
No, ma'am, we don't have a payment plan.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.275
Right, give me a minute. Wait.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.952
TERE - SHE HAS YOUR EYES!

19:23.537 --> 19:24.371
Look.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.167
Shit, no.
She looks nothing like you, dude.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.460
Don't be stupid, she's bloated.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.129
Okay…

19:35.048 --> 19:37.759
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER, 
COME TO THE HOSPITAL NOW.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.223
Where are you going, man?

19:45.225 --> 19:48.395
FOUR MONTHS LATER.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.530
I'LL CALL YUMIKO AT THE USUAL TIME

19:58.614 --> 20:00.532
She opened her eyes, ma'am.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.660
Yes, but don't pick her up,
it's not time yet.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.704
Remy is showing her some cards.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.873
Hello, darling.

20:07.956 --> 20:10.792
Hi, my beautiful princess.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.877
Hello, love.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.630
Done, the school finally confirmed.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.882
-Great.
-They'll see Regina on Tuesday.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.091
Not until Tuesday?

20:18.592 --> 20:20.052
No, it has to be earlier.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.013
It's been four months,
we're lagging behind!

20:23.096 --> 20:25.349
-Four months.
-No, it's not time for cuddles.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.601
She said the same to me, sir.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.270
-And when can I carry her?
-In 20 minutes.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.064
Twenty minutes.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.023
Remy…

20:33.899 --> 20:36.777
Bring the cards, please.
The ones with the circles.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.369
Hello?

20:47.454 --> 20:48.497
Which hospital?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.294
Hello?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.881
This isn't her, who's calling?

20:59.258 --> 21:02.594
Okay, I'll put her through. One second.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.512
The hospital.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.223
Yes, hello?

21:07.849 --> 21:09.768
Yes, yes, I am her mother.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.438
We are really sorry.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.400
This is a very unfortunate situation.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.154
Who has my daughter?
I mean, the other girl?

21:22.531 --> 21:23.365
Sorry.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.828
-You?
-You again?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.587
-You know each other?
-She's that obnoxious woman.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.423
That's the hag from the nursery.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.968
How could this happen?

21:43.468 --> 21:46.346
We were digitizing all the records and…

21:46.430 --> 21:49.683
Eenie, meenie, miny, mo,
catch a tiger by the toe.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.227
The head nurse spotted the mix-up.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.897
Of course, we fired the nurse responsible.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.152
Don't worry, I'll make sure
this is done in a lawful manner.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.821
Fortunately, we caught this on time.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.240
-"On time"?
-Do you think this is on time?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.199
Honey…

22:08.493 --> 22:11.955
Sorry I'm late, I went for coffee.
I'm the girl's grandmother.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.174
Nice to meet you.

22:24.593 --> 22:28.096
We have to run DNA tests
to document this situation,

22:28.180 --> 22:31.141
so we can proceed 
to the immediate exchange.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.894
It's what's best for the babies.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.277
I can't believe it.

22:43.987 --> 22:46.156
I can't believe you're not mine.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.454
My heart is torn to pieces.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.043
Oh, I feel like I'll die without you.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.049
You are mine.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.183
Shall I give her the bottle?

23:14.434 --> 23:16.228
Leave me alone with her, please.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.176
Aren't hugs supposed to be
in half an hour?

23:48.927 --> 23:49.970
I don't care.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.020
I'm not sure I can let them
take her away from me.

24:04.025 --> 24:04.985
Me neither.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.905
-Come in, take a seat.
-Thanks.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.747
This way.

24:17.831 --> 24:18.665
Thank you.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.793
-Hello.
-Have a seat.

24:21.877 --> 24:22.711
Thank you.

24:22.794 --> 24:23.753
Good evening.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.130
-Hi.
-Excuse me.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.675
You didn't shave her head?
Her hair will grow weird.

24:28.758 --> 24:29.718
Ceci…

24:31.595 --> 24:32.512
She's beautiful.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.482
Do you have a car chair?

24:44.232 --> 24:45.984
We don't have a car.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.863
Ramón can drive you home.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.364
Thanks.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.996
Hello, Regina.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.459
-Hello.
-We suggest non-biological families

25:02.542 --> 25:04.544
break contact with the babies

25:04.628 --> 25:06.588
and bond with their biological family.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.097
I could take care of both of them.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.934
I could adopt Regina.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.644
Regina is not up for adoption.

25:21.937 --> 25:22.771
Listen, girl.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.566
I imagine you didn't plan
on getting pregnant.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.360
-Neither did you.
-Ceci.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.198
Besides, it's obvious 
you don't have a stable relationship.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.076
The father couldn't come,
but he's a family friend.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.286
Let's go, Mom.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.956
-Yes.
-No, you can't take my daughter.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.666
You can't keep mine either.

25:42.749 --> 25:45.168
I don't want my sister 
to leave with the hippie.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.128
Technically, your sister is that one.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.756
And Mariana isn't a hippie,
she's not wearing sandals.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.509
Raggedy or whatever,
Regi can't go with her.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.344
Ceci, it's her daughter.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.347
This irresponsible child can't be a mom.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.474
"Irresponsible"? That's disrespectful.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.143
I'd never let you keep my daughter.
What's wrong with you?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.228
Let's see…

26:03.311 --> 26:04.354
Stop.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.816
Please exchange the girls.

26:07.899 --> 26:11.194
Otherwise, I'll call the authorities
to force you to do it.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.865
The counselor is right.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.585
Don't make this harder, love.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.759
Mariana… give her to me.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.602
Darling, please.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.847
-Let's go.
-I'll show you out.

27:20.930 --> 27:21.890
Excuse us.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.372
You said Regina had my eyes.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.212
It was all a mistake.

27:53.046 --> 27:56.549
I should've never used that website,
but Ana had been working nonstop.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.678
I'm a jerk.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.972
So, you vanished
off the face of the earth.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.767
I found out Ana was pregnant.

28:06.267 --> 28:09.396
No, Juan Carlos,
I'm not asking for an explanation.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.689
You don't owe me one.

28:12.148 --> 28:15.735
In the end, people go on those websites
for some reason or other.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.779
And I'm in no position to judge you.

28:18.321 --> 28:22.909
The truth is, we are free to do
whatever we want with our asses.

28:29.290 --> 28:32.627
Tere, you don't know how thankful I am…
for what happened.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.549
No one can find out.

28:39.759 --> 28:40.802
Don't worry.

28:42.637 --> 28:45.682
After today, we won't have to see
each other ever again.

28:51.938 --> 28:52.939
Bye, Juan Carlos.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.486
Goodbye, Tere.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.364
No.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.659
It's my treat… today.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.245
Take good care of Regina.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.747
Of course.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.817
ANA SERVÍN

29:37.901 --> 29:40.111
BENEND BABY - PREMIUM FORMULA

30:16.105 --> 30:17.232
I'll feed her, thanks.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.215
This one does have my eyes.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.132
Yes, right?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.177
So pretty, so pretty.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.179
A pretty princess.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.432
What are you two doing?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.018
We were--

30:54.102 --> 30:57.647
Once again, I don't want you
in my daughter's life only to bail later.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.483
Will you please relax?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.110
Pablo has been great so far.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.153
-Really? Great how?
-Yes.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.155
By showing up out of the blue?

31:07.782 --> 31:11.369
Pablo paid the hospital bill,
he's been giving me money for the girl.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.079
I mean, for the other girl.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.664
Why?

31:15.373 --> 31:17.000
Because it's my responsibility.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.587
We can't make ends meet, that's why!

31:20.670 --> 31:23.339
We're lucky we haven't been evicted
for not paying rent.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.341
Why didn't you say anything?

31:25.425 --> 31:28.344
I didn't want to worry you,
you have enough on your plate.

31:28.428 --> 31:31.639
You think I can't handle it?
How much do we owe in rent?

31:31.723 --> 31:35.393
Enough for us to pack our bags and go live
with your grandma in Tepoztlán.

31:35.476 --> 31:38.021
I told you,
I want to stay close to Valentina, Mom.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.315
Move in with me and my roomies.

31:40.398 --> 31:41.733
Oh, for fuck's sake!

31:42.317 --> 31:46.779
Well, your deadbeat father
never even asked to see a picture of you.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.866
You've been sending him pictures
in exchange for money?

31:51.576 --> 31:53.119
She's his daughter too.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.914
You're really something, Teresa.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.457
Hey, Mariana, get back here!

31:58.958 --> 32:02.086
Listen, Mom,
if Pablo leaves, I'll get over it,

32:02.170 --> 32:04.923
but I can't let him break my girl's heart.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.091
And I can't believe you can't get that.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.011
Stay away from my baby.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.888
Mariana, please!

32:15.350 --> 32:16.392
Sorry.

32:19.145 --> 32:23.191
The new product is stuck
at the US border, Yumiko.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.319
They're screwing us with import fees.
What do you want me to do?

32:26.903 --> 32:29.948
Can we guarantee a date
for the product to arrive?

32:30.031 --> 32:32.659
Otherwise, we'll have to cancel the order.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.620
We need it as soon as possible.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.914
Remy, please give her the other bottle.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.999
Ana-san.

32:40.083 --> 32:43.002
Is this a bad time for you to speak?

32:43.086 --> 32:46.798
No. There's nothing
I can do about this, Yumiko.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.801
You said you weren't working.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.261
Honey, no, no.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.930
I mean, I'm not--

32:55.431 --> 32:56.474
Come here, baby.

32:57.809 --> 33:02.897
Ana-san?

33:04.732 --> 33:06.985
I'll call you back
as soon as I find out more.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.125
Forgive me.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.753
I know I promised I'd stop working,

33:25.837 --> 33:28.047
to spend a whole year with my daughter…

33:28.715 --> 33:31.050
and with my family,
but that's just not me.

33:33.511 --> 33:36.014
And the worst thing is,
I don't know who I am…

33:37.223 --> 33:41.310
Because, on one hand, I'm not the mother
of the girl I thought was my daughter.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.353
And on the other…

33:43.062 --> 33:46.274
I'm not my biological child's mother
because I don't know her.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.071
I'm broken up about it.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.407
I'm the one who's sorry.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.286
I'm also quite confused about it.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.004
Come on, time to feed.

34:13.468 --> 34:14.302
Take her.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.485
Please, do something,
she hasn't stopped crying.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.403
Poor thing, she must be hungry.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.034
Hello, my love!

34:38.117 --> 34:41.662
Oh, my beautiful princess!

34:42.789 --> 34:45.500
You don't know how much
I've missed you.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.335
My princess.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.377
That's better.

34:48.461 --> 34:52.340
If we all had a boob on hand,
this world would be a better place.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.509
She hasn't stopped crying either.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.637
Oh, my baby. Why, sweetie?

34:57.720 --> 34:59.597
It seems she doesn't like to be held.

35:01.557 --> 35:03.309
Didn't you read the manual I sent you?

35:03.392 --> 35:06.395
Regina should only be held
20 minutes every 2 hours.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.605
She's used to it.

35:07.688 --> 35:10.525
Sorry, but I don't believe
in manuals for humans.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.819
Oh, why am I not surprised?

35:14.862 --> 35:17.657
Look, child,
I won't lie, I don't like you at all.

35:18.324 --> 35:20.576
Or the way you dress.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.412
And you could have a better haircut.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.832
Well, I don't like you either.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.875
And you could use some manners.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.587
Though I don't know who's worse,
you or my mom, seriously.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.552
Why don't you come live with me?

35:39.178 --> 35:41.097
I don't think that's a good idea.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.351
No, it's definitely a bad idea.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.651
Rock, paper, scissors?

35:55.153 --> 35:58.072
If I win, it's a no.
If you win, it's a yes, okay?

35:58.990 --> 35:59.949
Okay, deal.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.954
One, two, three, rock, paper, scissors.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.668
