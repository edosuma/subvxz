WEBVTT

00:19.144 --> 00:21.813
THREE YEARS LATER

00:21.896 --> 00:25.442
...constitutional president
of the United States of Mexico.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.194
From December 1st, 1988,

00:28.278 --> 00:32.198
to November 30th, 1994...

00:32.282 --> 00:35.368
Attorney at law,

00:35.452 --> 00:39.247
United States of Mexico
constitutional president

00:39.330 --> 00:41.207
will speak to the people.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.048
I affirm...

00:50.049 --> 00:53.303
to loyally execute...

00:54.429 --> 00:57.098
my job as President of the Republic

00:57.182 --> 00:59.392
given to me by the people...

01:00.435 --> 01:01.895
...always safeguarding

01:02.395 --> 01:05.607
the union's wellbeing.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.568
If I fail to comply with this task...

01:09.277 --> 01:11.237
may my country demand it from me.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.910
MMH
ADMINISTRATION OF FRAUDS

01:21.915 --> 01:24.626
Honorable Congress of the Union...

01:25.752 --> 01:27.337
citizens of Mexico...

01:28.713 --> 01:31.424
with emotion and conviction...

01:32.467 --> 01:36.179
I've promised to protect

01:36.262 --> 01:39.182
our constitution...

01:53.363 --> 01:57.575
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

01:57.659 --> 02:01.913
I feel the fear sweat dripping away

02:01.996 --> 02:06.501
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

02:06.584 --> 02:12.549
I am a breeze that grows stronger

02:12.632 --> 02:16.427
Even when the clouds drift away

02:17.512 --> 02:20.974
Even when my skin dries away

02:21.683 --> 02:25.478
I'll be back someday

02:26.271 --> 02:30.942
To unleash my return

02:34.612 --> 02:38.783
I have the dust
that protects the road

02:38.867 --> 02:43.788
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

02:43.872 --> 02:48.167
I'm the guardian of the tired night

02:48.251 --> 02:53.798
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

02:54.591 --> 02:58.136
Even when the clouds drift away

02:59.262 --> 03:02.765
Even when my skin dries away

03:02.849 --> 03:07.562
I'll be back someday

03:07.645 --> 03:12.317
To unleash my return

03:42.931 --> 03:45.475
-Why won't anybody stop him?
-He's the owner.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.853
Who the fuck do you think you are?

03:54.192 --> 03:55.443
Ramón!

03:55.526 --> 03:57.612
It's me, it's me, it's me!

04:01.866 --> 04:03.493
How are you, Chapo?

04:07.163 --> 04:08.581
What did he do?

04:08.665 --> 04:10.708
I didn't like his haircut.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.754
-Let's go inside, man.
-Yeah.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.222
TOÑO
CHAPO'S GUNMAN

04:24.305 --> 04:27.767
-Why did you want to see me?
-I have a business proposal.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.894
Cut it out, Ramón.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.146
Weed, how much?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.273
Blow.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.028
I like my plants better, Chapo.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.280
They're cheaper.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.366
But it won't last.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.244
Sooner or later,
it will be legalized.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.246
Whoever controls
the marijuana business wins.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.914
Maybe.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.166
But for now,
Yankees want blow.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.379
What are you thinking?

04:56.462 --> 04:59.048
Tijuana's the best place
to cross the border.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.135
And I'm the best man for the job.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.596
Let's be partners.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.058
You open your territory for me,
and I do the crossing.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.811
We all win.

05:11.894 --> 05:15.356
Why do you like
to complicate things, fucker?

05:16.774 --> 05:17.817
Meaning?

05:18.943 --> 05:21.863
You know how it is, Chapo,
how it will always be.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.326
If we eventually turn to coke,

05:26.409 --> 05:28.661
we'll use Amado, not you.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.955
No offense, Chapo,

05:31.039 --> 05:34.584
but bosses
only deal with bosses.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.014
-Let's go.
-Where?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.725
-The airport.
-They said no.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.685
I don't care what they said.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.439
We'll cross their territory,
and they won't know a thing.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.402
BENJAMÍN AND RAMÓN AVENDAÑO
TIJUANA BOSSES

06:16.834 --> 06:20.004
I need someone trustworthy
to cross Tijuana.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.549
No time like the present.
When do I leave?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.899
The Avendaños know nothing
about this job.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.077
Joaquín, are you sure?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.914
-If they catch us, they'll kill us.
-That's why I'm asking you, pal.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.797
If someone can do it...

07:03.798 --> 07:04.799
it's you.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.666
Rayo, the small cans are good.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.751
The big cans have the merch.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.652
We're fucked.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.446
Those are Avendaño's men.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.171
-What's in there?
-Good evening.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.965
Chili. We were
on our way to the border.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.093
Park it here.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.095
We have to check the trucks.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.154
Chili. Well.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.323
Show me a can.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.254
Here, boss.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.139
Those cans
have different colors. Why?

09:19.183 --> 09:21.602
Well... They're bigger.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.325
Open up.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.762
No, no, wait, boss.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.265
Don't open that one,
I'll lose two kilos.

09:59.348 --> 10:00.808
It's double the money.

10:00.891 --> 10:04.186
Come on, you know us.
We always use this route.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.189
Please. I'll give you your part.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.566
Okay? Wait here.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.738
There you go.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.205
Next time, I'll bring some crackers
for the boys, okay?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.875
Please close the doors,
I don't want the cans to get dirty.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.376
Okay, off you go.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.503
Thanks, boss.
Close the doors.

10:48.439 --> 10:52.109
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
MR. CHETO'S WAREHOUSE

10:52.193 --> 10:53.944
Now you'll see, Don Cheto.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.385
Well done, bud.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.096
Tough blow for the Avendaños.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.473
You say the word,
I'll get my hands dirty.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.321
ALEJANDRA'S HOUSE
CHAPO'S FIRST WIFE

11:38.364 --> 11:40.032
-Hello.
-Mrs. Alejandra.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.330
-Joaquín. Toño.
-Here.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.416
-Ma'am.
-What's up, Armando?

11:48.499 --> 11:49.542
Hello.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.756
-I didn't know you were coming.
-Here.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.176
-Buy whatever you want.
-What's this?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.929
A little something
from the Avendaños.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.851
I don't get you.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.185
Those two are ready.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.815
You have enough money,
but you go and do this.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.777
Trying to fuck
with the Avendaños.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.863
What are you talking about?

12:18.946 --> 12:20.823
They know nothing about this.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.868
Stop complaining and help me.
Put the money in the bag.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.205
You want revenge
because they belittled you.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.208
Am I wrong?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.840
-Am I wrong?
-About what?

12:37.923 --> 12:40.968
About you wanting revenge.
Just like your father did.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.681
-Belittling you because you're not a boss.
-Stop talking shit.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.323
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE
MEXICO CITY

13:05.493 --> 13:07.995
-The general will see you soon.
-Thank you.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.495
Conrado Higuera Sol.

13:49.578 --> 13:54.333
Secretary for the Labor Party presidency.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.172
GENERAL BLANCO
NATIONAL SECURITY CONSULTANT

14:00.256 --> 14:02.091
You come highly recommended.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.386
But even if the Pope told me
you were the man for the job,

14:06.095 --> 14:08.222
I'll decide what to do with you.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.309
You were told the position
is for internal communication consultant.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.936
-Yes, sir.
-Wrong.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.022
Your job would be to be my slave.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.484
Any problems with that?

14:21.318 --> 14:22.528
-No.
-Good.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.738
I have to choose
between you and another man like you.

14:24.822 --> 14:29.285
Both graduated college
with honors and all that shit.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.996
Why should I choose you?

14:34.498 --> 14:36.292
Because I want to be president.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.336
And I don't mind
starting as an ass-kisser.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.383
CONSTRUCTION BEGINS
FOR FIRST MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

14:44.466 --> 14:45.593
Wake him up.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.349
Boss.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.853
Boss.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.354
Don Miguel Ángel.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.273
What?

14:59.356 --> 15:01.358
Don Miguel Ángel on the phone.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.237
Miguelón.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.283
Read the news. Page four.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.493
Okay, give me a minute.

15:16.248 --> 15:20.294
"Construction begins
for the first maximum security prison.

15:21.170 --> 15:25.466
The president's first step
was to start building

15:25.549 --> 15:28.218
the first Mexican
maximum security prison..."

15:28.302 --> 15:32.056
"...Almoloya's Federal Center
for Social Readaptation."

15:33.140 --> 15:36.477
Why the fuck is he building
a maximum security prison?

15:40.648 --> 15:44.151
Did something change
since this guy came into power?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.362
No.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.199
-Everything's still the same.
-I don't know, Miguelón.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.577
-I don't like this one bit.
-Me neither.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.412
Boss.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.707
Chapo's looking for you.
Says he brought you a present.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.795
I'll call you later, okay? Chapo's here.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.255
Be careful with that fucker, Miguel.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.926
After Colombia,
he thinks he's a big deal.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.860
-Why did you bring me a present?
-I'm celebrating.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.572
And there's more.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.912
15 million for the organization.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.624
Take them inside.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.503
I know how useful you are, Chapo.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.131
Why don't you tell me what you want?

16:47.214 --> 16:49.425
-Make me a boss.
-Not yet.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.970
-I've waited a long time for this.
-Not enough.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.055
Take the car.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.057
I deserve this, Miguel Ángel.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.352
Take it before I forget
how much money you make me.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.379
GRACIELA'S HOUSE
CHAPO'S SECOND WIFE

17:42.936 --> 17:43.979
What happened?

17:58.786 --> 18:00.579
-The boy?
-At school.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.728
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE
MEXICO CITY

18:27.356 --> 18:29.358
Excuse me, Mr. President.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.446
-News from General Blanco?
-Yes, sir.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.615
Everything's ready.
We can begin the operations.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.247
DEA CHIEF MEXICO

18:58.303 --> 18:59.388
Downtown.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.774
Don Amado, please.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.318
Would you do us the honor
of giving a speech?

19:13.402 --> 19:16.488
-Mm, no...
-Yes...

19:20.826 --> 19:22.035
Okay, okay.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.163
To continue with our celebration,
we'll make a toast

19:24.246 --> 19:25.372
to the lovely couple...

19:25.455 --> 19:27.708
Don't move! Don't move!

19:27.791 --> 19:30.878
...who don't know
what's awaiting them...

19:31.628 --> 19:33.589
-Cheers!
-Don't move!

19:33.672 --> 19:35.465
Or everyone dies.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.968
Disarm them!

19:38.051 --> 19:39.970
-What's going on, Blanco?
-I don't know you.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.724
Take him.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.231
Don't move!

20:02.910 --> 20:05.579
You can't do this
to my client. It's inhuman.

20:05.662 --> 20:06.955
Uncuff him.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.761
I'm not Amado...

20:21.678 --> 20:23.680
but if you had called me,
I'd have come.

20:24.514 --> 20:28.143
Not if you knew
you wouldn't be allowed to leave again.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.020
There are deals in place.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.397
That's in the past.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.815
Fucking traitors.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.945
That's why the newbie
ordered that prison to be built.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.780
He wants to change the rules.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.741
Not just the rules.
He wants to own the game.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.791
Miguel Angel put the meeting together.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.501
So we'll meet
with the real bosses this time?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.628
That's what Güero said.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.089
I think you made it, pal.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.132
Don't jinx me, asshole.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.663
Buddy.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.833
How are you, Güerito?

21:38.797 --> 21:40.507
Your cooperation.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.677
We can't set you free,

21:43.760 --> 21:46.054
but you'll have
a good time in prison.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.315
Hello, Mr. Emilio.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.983
-Güero.
-How are you?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.736
-Rafael.
-How are you?

Mr. Emilio.

EMILIO QUINTERO PAYÁN

22:06.783 --> 22:08.160
Good to see you, Joaquín.

22:10.078 --> 22:12.205
RAFAEL AGUILAR GUAJARDO
BOSS

22:17.127 --> 22:18.587
What if I refuse?

22:20.255 --> 22:22.716
We'll extradite you to the United States.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.052
And the Avendaños?

22:25.135 --> 22:27.095
They sent Don Chuy on their behalf.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.935
Hello, everyone.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.396

22:36.480 --> 22:38.440
-How's it going, Emilio?
-Ismael.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.450
-Well, I'm still here, so...
-Good.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.576
Beer, son.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.953
Good morning, Mr. Ismael.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.125
I hope Mrs. Rosaura
is feeling better.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.628
She's better, thanks.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.173
-And your family?
-Good.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.717
My Quino's the same age
as your boy.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.427
Always playing soccer.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.264
Same as my Mayelito.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.724
Good to see you, Joaquín.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.228
Thank you for coming.

LIVAS
MIGUEL ÁNGEL'S LAWYER

23:28.198 --> 23:30.742
Don Miguel Ángel sends his regards.

23:33.453 --> 23:37.124
As you know, this meeting
has been called on his behalf

23:37.207 --> 23:41.128
so we can reorganize the business
after his arrest.

23:56.059 --> 23:59.187
But before we start,
Miguel Ángel wants you to meet

23:59.271 --> 24:03.275
the person
who'll be in charge from now on.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.156
Good morning, everyone.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.460
-What's this?
-Please, sit.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.004
What's this, Livas?

24:24.087 --> 24:25.255
Please, sit.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.634
We'll distribute
Miguel Ángel's territories

24:29.718 --> 24:33.597
by mutual agreement
with the federal government.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.270
Everyone, calm down.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.230
Don Miguel's orders.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.982
Please, sit.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.959
Division of territories.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.964
Chihuahua and Nuevo Laredo

25:08.048 --> 25:10.842
will be managed
by Rafael Aguilar Guajardo,

25:10.926 --> 25:14.763
who will also control
Ciudad Juárez

25:14.846 --> 25:17.015
on behalf of Amado.

25:20.727 --> 25:21.978
Sinaloa...

25:23.063 --> 25:24.606
to Ismael.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.612
The Avendaños
will be in charge of Tijuana.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.744
Nogales and Hermosillo
will now be managed

25:37.827 --> 25:39.412
by Emilio Quintero Payán.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.380
San Luis Río Colorado
goes to Heriberto Palma.

25:49.673 --> 25:53.218
Rafael Chao will control Mexicali.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.763
And Tecate...

25:57.514 --> 26:00.517
is now Joaquín Guzmán Loera's...

26:03.979 --> 26:05.855
MEXICAN UNITED STATES

26:08.692 --> 26:11.444
...who, from this day forward...

26:12.654 --> 26:14.656
will be recognized as a boss.

26:56.239 --> 27:01.244
JOAQUÍN GUZMÁN LOERA
BOSS

27:01.328 --> 27:03.705
-Congrats, boss.
-Well done, Chapo.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.291
To Miguel Ángel,

27:06.374 --> 27:08.501
who's in jail,
but did a good deed.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.795
He should've made me boss
when I asked him to.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.590
Miguel Ángel is fucked.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.924
But me?

27:16.926 --> 27:18.345
I'm unstoppable now.

27:19.763 --> 27:20.764
Cheers!

27:21.848 --> 27:23.058
Hi, sweetie.

27:23.141 --> 27:26.603
-Bring more ice, okay?
-Do it yourself.

27:26.686 --> 27:29.189
Quino, be careful, son.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.148
Hold this.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.109
-Do you want one?
-Yes.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.821
Ale, the tray.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.493
You still mad?

27:41.576 --> 27:44.204
Now you care?
I thought I only talked shit.

27:46.539 --> 27:47.916
Hello, everyone.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.627
Be careful or she'll get jealous.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.255
Dad!

27:55.548 --> 27:56.633
Son!

27:58.093 --> 27:59.844
Go play with your brother.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.765
Come here.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.185
-I brought this.
-Thank you.

28:07.268 --> 28:09.479
There's some meat
if the boy's hungry.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.648
Later, when they stop playing.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.942
Need a hand?

28:21.074 --> 28:22.200
Asshole.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.160
For you.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.456
Hello.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.959
Hello?

28:31.042 --> 28:32.252
Congrats, Chapito.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.338
-Ramón?
-Yes, who else?

28:36.881 --> 28:40.093
Benjamín told me to invite you
to Ismael's birthday party.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.512
In Tijuana?

28:42.595 --> 28:45.515
Yeah, it will be a huge party.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.684
Bring a good present, asshole.

28:56.609 --> 28:58.069
I got another job for you, pal.

28:58.778 --> 29:01.698
-It's a party.
-Okay.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.450
You'll go on my behalf,

29:03.533 --> 29:05.702
so buy a very nice present.

29:06.703 --> 29:10.206
Tell the Avendaños I'm sorry,
I had a family emergency

29:10.290 --> 29:12.834
or something,
but make it good.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.128
Why can't you make it?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.923
Because we have work to do.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.426
Don't fuck this up.

29:21.509 --> 29:25.263
You wanted to be a boss so bad,
and now you won't enjoy it?

29:25.346 --> 29:27.015
You're wrong, Güero.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.641
I want to enjoy everything.

29:28.725 --> 29:32.437
But the more power I have,
the more I'll enjoy it.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.647
You have to walk
before you start running, pal.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.524
Easy does it.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.152
Miguelón is in jail, man.
We can start running now.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.031
His men have no leader.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.159
Rayo will go to the party,
and we'll recruit Miguel's men

29:46.242 --> 29:47.619
before someone else does it.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.292
If you tell me what you need,

29:54.375 --> 29:56.252
-maybe I can help you.
-Move.

30:16.981 --> 30:19.192
Easy, easy, everyone!

30:21.027 --> 30:23.446
We just want
to talk to your boss.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.076
Boss.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.121
Nobody move!

31:23.965 --> 31:25.091
We just want to talk.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.594
Your boss is in jail, yes or no?

31:27.677 --> 31:29.095
Well, yes.

31:29.178 --> 31:32.473
-And you want to keep working?
-Yes, sir, but...

31:34.309 --> 31:35.310
It's your choice.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.980
Stay on the losing side
and keep working for Miguel Ángel,

31:39.063 --> 31:41.733
or come work for me
on the winning side.

31:41.816 --> 31:47.280
I'm sorry, boss, but I can't ditch
Miguel Ángel that easily.

31:49.657 --> 31:51.534
-Are you afraid he'll kill you?
-Yes.

31:52.535 --> 31:55.413
-But you're not afraid I'll kill you?
-Well, yes.

31:55.496 --> 31:58.082
But I'm more scared of him.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.027
From now on, you work for me.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.744
LIVA'S HOUSE. MIGUEL ÁNGEL'S LAWYER
GUADALAJARA

33:41.894 --> 33:43.604
Here you go.

33:44.480 --> 33:48.192
All the evidence
Mr. Miguel Ángel spent years gathering.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.485
GOVERNOR OF SINALOA

33:49.569 --> 33:51.696
Bribes to politicians, the army,

33:51.779 --> 33:53.990
everyone he bought.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.586
Well, you've got
what you were looking for.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.546
-Where are your guards?
-Excuse me?

34:09.839 --> 34:11.382
We don't want no trouble.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.594
We'll take the evidence and leave.
We don't want no trouble.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.137
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.514
That your guards
are waiting to kill us.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.768
But we aren't leaving alone.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.936
-You're coming with us.
-Move!

34:25.480 --> 34:26.731
Let's go.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.113
This way.

34:35.531 --> 34:36.949
Hey!

34:39.285 --> 34:41.370
-So we weren't overreacting.
-Don't shoot.

34:42.622 --> 34:43.498
Put the guns down.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.044
-Or your boss dies.
-Put them down!

35:01.766 --> 35:03.142
Easy, pal.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.979
Grab the briefcase.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.176
-Happy birthday, love.
-Thanks.

36:18.259 --> 36:21.012
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thanks, son.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.306
-Pal.
-Thanks, man.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.893
-This is amazing.
-My pleasure, man.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.645
It was the least I could do for you.
No need to thank me.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.695
Well, look at that.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.865
Rayo López.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.242
You're a sight for sore eyes, sweetie.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.662
-Are you staying here?
-Yes.

36:47.955 --> 36:51.125
But even if I wasn't, with you here,
I'd change hotels in no time.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.963
So, want to have a drink?

36:56.047 --> 36:58.382
And you can tell me
what you're doing here.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.718
Okay. But just one.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.516
Happy birthday, Don Ismael!

37:07.600 --> 37:10.061
Ramón. Thanks.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.313
Do you remember our boy?

37:12.396 --> 37:14.106
Lobito?

37:14.190 --> 37:15.983
Of course. See how tall he is?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.818
Don't be like that, asshole.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.696
-Pay your respects.
-Happy birthday, Don Ismael.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.658
-Thanks, boy.
-Come on, Ismael.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.454
-Excuse me.
-Of course, man.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.500
What's this? Is it for me?

37:37.713 --> 37:40.049
It's a present
for a party I'm going to.

37:40.132 --> 37:43.261
If you want anything, just ask.
Your wish is my command.

37:43.344 --> 37:46.222
-Cut it.
-I'm not doing anything.

37:46.305 --> 37:49.433
-Where were we?
-You never change...

37:50.893 --> 37:52.353
Tell me about that party.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.855
You'll have to see it
to believe me.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.901
But I think
that can be arranged, don't you?

37:59.735 --> 38:00.736
Cheers.

38:38.607 --> 38:42.570
Whoever did this came
for whatever was in there.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.868
General, one of the guards is still alive.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.787
He saw everything.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.586
It was Guzmán Loera, El Chapo.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.064
That asshole Chapo isn't here yet.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.982
Güero is late, too.

39:20.066 --> 39:24.528
He can't do this shit.
Who does that fucker think he is?

39:24.612 --> 39:26.739
Slow down
with the alcohol, Ramón.

39:26.822 --> 39:28.115
I want a quiet night.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.223
There you go. Thanks.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.392
Rayo, did you really have to come?

39:54.475 --> 39:58.479
-We should have stayed at the hotel.
-I have to do this for my pal.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.940
-Just a few minutes, and we can go.
-Okay.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.650
Let's go.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.026
What's up?

40:05.152 --> 40:06.237
What's your name?

40:06.320 --> 40:08.781
Armando López,
but they call me Rayo.

40:08.864 --> 40:12.034
-I love that song. Let's go!
-Just a minute.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.666
You're not on the list.
I can't let you in.

40:18.749 --> 40:22.503
Then look for my pal's name.
Go ahead.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.797
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.091
-We're not going in?
-Wait.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.593
I told you.
Look for my pal's name.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.888
El Chapo. Joaquín Guzmán, go on.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.640
I said, leave.

40:34.723 --> 40:37.268
-Don't talk to me like that, asshole.
-What's your problem?

40:37.351 --> 40:40.563
-Wait. I said, wait!
-I'm sorry, he drank too much...

40:40.646 --> 40:43.524
There it is. Look, here.
Are you blind or what? Look, man.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.859
Armando, stop it.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.320
Listen to your woman, asshole.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.907
Don't tell me what to do, fucker.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.742
I'm here on behalf
of Chapo Guzmán, move.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.661
No, no, stop it!

40:55.744 --> 40:57.621
Stop it now!

40:57.705 --> 40:59.331
What are you doing? Stop!

40:59.415 --> 41:02.001
I don't give a fuck
about that asshole.

41:02.084 --> 41:04.420
-Am I lying?
- Leave him alone!

41:04.503 --> 41:06.714
Stop this now!

41:06.797 --> 41:09.633
-What the fuck?
-Stop it! Leave him alone!

41:09.717 --> 41:11.969
Ramón! Jimmy.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.848
-Let him go!
-Let him go!

41:17.183 --> 41:19.977
-Ramón, it's me. Rayo.
-What the fuck are you doing here, fucker?

41:20.644 --> 41:22.229
I'm here on behalf of Chapo.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.982
Who the fuck does he think he is,
sending a cheap drunk?

41:25.065 --> 41:28.277
-Watch it, asshole.
-Your boss is the asshole, fucker.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.945
Send this to Chapo.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.575
Ramón!

42:13.781 --> 42:15.032
Follow me, please.

42:55.447 --> 42:56.865
For your troubles, Doctor.

43:06.125 --> 43:09.044
They belittle me
and then kill my man.

43:14.049 --> 43:16.010
This is the end
of the Avendaños, Güero.

43:35.195 --> 43:39.491
Sir, Joaquín Guzmán Loera is the killer.
They call him Chapo.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.870
I believe we should kill hm.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.372
Go ahead.

43:47.374 --> 43:51.420
-I think that would be a mistake, sir.
-Don't disrespect the president, asshole.

43:51.503 --> 43:53.130
Easy. Let him speak.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.092
With all due respect,
Mr. President...

43:58.510 --> 44:01.263
the bosses see General Blanco
as an imposed leader.

44:01.347 --> 44:02.598
They didn't choose him.

44:02.681 --> 44:05.100
If we kill one of them so soon,

44:05.184 --> 44:08.354
the balance we have now
could be disrupted.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.816
What's your name?

44:12.900 --> 44:15.235
Conrado Higuera Sol, Mr. President.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.863
Due to his lack of experience,
Mr. Sol can't understand

44:17.946 --> 44:20.115
that you don't ask
the drug lords for their opinion.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.076
You give them orders,
and they must follow them.

44:22.159 --> 44:25.120
If they don't, you kill them.

44:26.747 --> 44:27.998
You're both right.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.376
Control that Chapo.

44:32.127 --> 44:35.130
But do it... without violence.

44:36.131 --> 44:38.050
Like Mr. Sol suggested.

44:39.968 --> 44:41.428
Of course, sir.

44:49.186 --> 44:51.313
I'm sorry, General.

44:51.397 --> 44:53.190
It was careless of me.

44:53.273 --> 44:55.401
-It won't happen again, sir.
-Of course it won't!

44:55.484 --> 44:58.362
Because if it does,
you'll be dining with maggots.

47:13.747 --> 47:16.667
