NARRATOR:
Previously onX-Men...

00:02.166 --> 00:04.708
Do you,
Scott Summers,
take this woman

00:04.708 --> 00:06.416
to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

00:06.416 --> 00:07.458
I do.

00:07.458 --> 00:10.208
You’ll destroy them all.

00:10.208 --> 00:13.333
I’ll destroy them all.

00:13.333 --> 00:18.000
Xavier, terrible violence.
Meet me
at these coordinates.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.875
Magneto!
That’s in Antarctica!

00:20.875 --> 00:22.416
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

00:23.708 --> 00:24.750
(LAUGHING)

00:28.000 --> 00:31.208
What if I’d been lying
about not being able to
touch another human being?

00:33.333 --> 00:34.583
(GAMBIT GROANING)

00:37.166 --> 00:41.000
We have information that
a violent anti-mutant
attack is expected

00:41.000 --> 00:42.375
at the mutant
halfway house.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.291
Go!

00:45.250 --> 00:47.000
-Hi!
-Won’t you come in?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.416
How about
a truly beastly workout?

00:51.750 --> 00:52.625
Oh, dear.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.750
Fire on that mutant.
Full energy!

00:56.750 --> 00:57.958
(GROANS)

00:59.083 --> 01:00.291
(GROANS)

02:18.625 --> 02:21.875
We better get going, Jean,
if we want to reach
the island by sundown.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.500
(PANTING)

02:27.500 --> 02:29.958
This is definitely not
the workout I programmed.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.583
When the Danger Room
is against you...

02:39.583 --> 02:42.000
turn the Danger Room
against itself.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.208
(PANTING)

02:52.625 --> 02:57.083
Xavier’s school.
I belonged here
once.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.000
I was an X-Man.

03:00.708 --> 03:03.583
I sense your
determination
fading, Morph.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.583
You!
What do you
want from me?

03:05.583 --> 03:09.708
I’m here to make sure you
are still committed to
our purpose,

03:09.708 --> 03:11.708
to destroy the X-Men.

03:11.708 --> 03:14.250
Destroy the X-Men? No!

03:15.625 --> 03:19.458
They’re my friends!

03:21.333 --> 03:24.333
But friends don’t
betray friends,
Morph.

03:24.333 --> 03:26.083
They don’t abandon them!

03:28.208 --> 03:31.125
No. But two are missing!

03:31.125 --> 03:35.000
I sent them... I sent them...

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Somewhere very romantic.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.833
But Cyclops and
Jean Grey are mine!

03:43.500 --> 03:46.750
We’re finally alone,
just the two of us,

03:46.750 --> 03:49.750
without
another person
for a hundred miles.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.416
Oh, Scott.

03:55.625 --> 03:58.458
RUCKUS: Ahoy!
On the sailboat!

04:00.708 --> 04:02.250
JEAN: Who could that be?

04:02.250 --> 04:04.083
I thought
the island
was uninhabited.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.000
I have a message for you!

04:09.833 --> 04:11.000
Go ahead!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.333
With pleasure!

04:24.250 --> 04:28.250
Looks like you are all
dry-docked, permanently!

04:30.083 --> 04:31.958
Nobody invited you on
the honeymoon!

04:31.958 --> 04:33.000
(SCREAMS)

04:33.000 --> 04:34.291
Scott!

04:34.291 --> 04:36.458
You ain’t going nowhere,
lady!

04:36.458 --> 04:38.833
(JEAN GRUNTS)

04:38.833 --> 04:43.875
Collar them.
I don’t want to
have to hurt them, yet.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.250
(GROANS)

04:46.250 --> 04:48.458
My powers!

04:48.458 --> 04:53.458
These are out of
fashion now on Genosha,
but on you it looks good!

04:53.458 --> 04:55.125
(COLLARS BEEPING)

04:57.000 --> 04:59.583
(GROANING)

04:59.583 --> 05:05.000
It will be easier
if you don’t resist,
and less dangerous.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.958
Who are you?
What do you want with us?

05:06.958 --> 05:11.000
My name
is Sinister,
Mr. Sinister.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.125
Peace officers
and the media.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.833
Not a good combination
for a purported

05:22.833 --> 05:25.625
gun-toting troublemaker
like myself.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.291
Then we sneak in.
Come on.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.250
After you.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.458
Hmm. Nice work, Beast.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.250
Storm!
What have they
done to you, gal?

05:50.958 --> 05:54.583
She’s sleeping deeply,
but according to her
medical charts,

05:54.583 --> 05:57.416
Storm should
recover with time.

05:57.416 --> 06:00.125
(SIGHING) I shouldn’t
have left her alone
with that mob.

06:00.125 --> 06:01.458
I should have been
there to help her!

06:01.458 --> 06:03.250
It wasn’t your fault.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.375
At least I tried to help!

06:05.375 --> 06:08.458
I didn’t say I’d be there
and then never show my
shaggy blue hide!

06:08.458 --> 06:10.958
But I was never
told of your mission.

06:10.958 --> 06:12.583
Don’t try to feed
me that hog slop!

06:12.583 --> 06:14.458
I was with Storm
when she called you.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.166
This is very odd, indeed.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.708
Perhaps someone...

06:19.708 --> 06:20.875
DOCTOR: Someone’s
in the mutant’s room!

06:20.875 --> 06:22.625
Uh-oh!

06:22.625 --> 06:24.500
Security!

06:24.500 --> 06:28.416
Perhaps we should return
during normal
visiting hours.

06:34.416 --> 06:37.583
Leader! Leader! Leader!
Leader! Leader! Leader!

06:37.583 --> 06:43.583
What we have
accomplished tonight
is a warning to all mutants

06:43.583 --> 06:46.291
of what the future
holds for them!

06:46.291 --> 06:49.708
Tomorrow belongs
to humanity,

06:49.708 --> 06:55.583
a humanity cleansed
of this foul mutant
disease!

06:55.583 --> 06:58.458
Here’s one of them!
A mutant!

06:58.458 --> 07:00.750
What should
we do with her?

07:00.750 --> 07:02.250
Get rid of her!

07:02.250 --> 07:03.708
It’ll be one
less mutant freak!

07:03.708 --> 07:04.958
You’ve heard the verdict.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.416
(CROWD CHEERING)

07:06.416 --> 07:09.708
The normal people
have spoken.

07:09.708 --> 07:12.291
You call
this bunch of
sickos normal?

07:12.291 --> 07:15.416
Why do you hate us?
What did we ever
do to you?

07:15.416 --> 07:20.375
You were born.
Take her away!

07:20.375 --> 07:22.958
You wouldn’t be so brave
if my hands weren’t tied!

07:35.333 --> 07:37.875
You sure pick
weird places to hang out.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.375
Storm sent me to
one of their headquarters
and their goons grabbed me.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.333
It’s not my fault!

07:43.333 --> 07:46.125
If you knew how much
bubblegum I had to sniff
to find you...

07:49.458 --> 07:51.458

-MAN 2: He’s in the alley.

07:51.458 --> 07:54.625
-MAN 3: After them. Get them!
-MAN 4: Come on! This way!

07:54.625 --> 07:58.000
BEAST: These constant
recriminations are
counterproductive.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.458
It don’t matter how pretty
you try to make it sound,

08:00.458 --> 08:02.375
you weren’t there for Storm
when she needed you!

08:02.375 --> 08:03.458
(GROANS)

08:03.458 --> 08:05.375
You two make enough noise

08:05.375 --> 08:07.250
to wake the half-dead.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.583
(GASPING) Gambit!
You’re okay!

08:09.583 --> 08:11.458
No thanks to you, chere.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.875
You told Gambit
a little kiss wouldn’t hurt.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.708
No, I didn’t.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.875
You snuck a kiss
and got what was
coming to you!

08:17.875 --> 08:21.208
Gambit don’t never go
where he’s not invited.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.958

for angry words!

08:25.583 --> 08:28.250
Apparently,
I’ve returned
just in time.

08:28.250 --> 08:31.375
And the news I
have is disturbing.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.625
I have just discovered
that we may all be
under attack

08:34.625 --> 08:36.750
by a most unusual weapon,

08:36.750 --> 08:39.875
a neural disruptor
which alters brain
waves,

08:39.875 --> 08:44.583
causing its target
to behave in strange,
even irrational ways.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.750
(SNIFFING)

08:46.750 --> 08:52.208
It can’t be!
But I can smell him!
Morph’s here! He’s alive!

08:52.208 --> 08:55.708
Restrain him!
He’s being affected
by the neural disruptor!

It’s Morph!

09:13.125 --> 09:14.750
(GROANS)

09:14.750 --> 09:18.208
He’s out of control!
Destroy him!

09:18.208 --> 09:20.708
Gambit never
hear the Professor
say that before.

deserves another!

He’s alive.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.458
And in a lousy mood.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.958
I can’t believe it.

09:45.958 --> 09:48.416
I’m sealing
off the school’s
defensive perimeter.

09:48.416 --> 09:50.083
He won’t be able
to leave the grounds.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.500
But why would
Morph want to
hurt us?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
I cannot be certain.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.583
Perhaps because
we left him behind.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.458
(BEEPING)

10:04.458 --> 10:06.125
You wouldn’t leave
without saying goodbye.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.875
After
we were whipped
by the Sentinels,

10:19.875 --> 10:23.000
I tried to make Cyclops
go back for you and Beast.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.083
(SCREAMS)

10:26.083 --> 10:29.583
Cyclops had to
leave you behind
to save the rest of us.

Maybe he was wrong,
but that’s no reason
for revenge.

to hate.

He’s never left you behind!

14:11.458 --> 14:15.208
MR. SINISTER:
Shoot him and I destroy you!

14:15.208 --> 14:17.375
You again!
Who are you?

14:17.375 --> 14:19.708
You know who I am, Morph.

14:19.708 --> 14:22.750
Think. Remember.

14:22.750 --> 14:26.208
I can’t! I can’t!

14:26.208 --> 14:27.250
(SCREAMS)

14:28.708 --> 14:30.000
(SCREAMS)

14:33.958 --> 14:36.583
MR. SINISTER:
I found you, lying lifeless

14:36.583 --> 14:40.375
outside the mutant
registration headquarters.

14:40.375 --> 14:46.000
After your friends had
deserted you, I healed
your broken body.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.958
I gave you new life,
but your mind was
beyond repair.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.500
You became two people.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.583
The one you would
recognize as Morph,

14:54.583 --> 14:56.625
and the one
who interested me,

14:56.625 --> 14:59.416
the one who wanted
revenge on his betrayer!

15:00.625 --> 15:02.166
I remember!

15:04.416 --> 15:05.875
(EXPLOSION)

15:05.875 --> 15:09.750
Destroy them!
Tear them apart!

15:09.750 --> 15:11.208
I wouldn’t bet on it!

15:17.375 --> 15:18.708
(SHRIEKING)

15:22.375 --> 15:25.875
I never thought
a super sense of hearing
could be so painful.

15:25.875 --> 15:30.500
That’s because
you never heard Ruckus
raise a ruckus before!

15:30.500 --> 15:31.750
(GRUNTS)

15:33.000 --> 15:34.875
Didn’t anybody ever tell you?

15:34.875 --> 15:38.000
You don’t kick a man
when he’s down, hairbag!

15:38.000 --> 15:40.958
Hey! Who told you my name?

15:40.958 --> 15:42.958
You making fun of me?

15:42.958 --> 15:45.625
Nobody makes fun of Hairbag!

15:52.333 --> 15:57.416
I’ll just have to swat
you like a blue-tail fly!

15:57.416 --> 16:01.583
You’ll just be a greasy
blue spot on the sand!

16:02.583 --> 16:03.958
Huh?

16:03.958 --> 16:05.416
Y’all don’t mind
if I play through?

16:09.708 --> 16:13.125
Two of you! The odds are
getting better and better!

16:13.125 --> 16:14.583
(GROWLING)

16:14.583 --> 16:15.708
(COUGHING)

16:17.291 --> 16:20.416
I’m choking!
My eyes! I can’t see!

16:20.416 --> 16:23.000
Then you won’t
know what hit you!

16:25.000 --> 16:27.333
Gambit say,
"You play fair or
you don’t play at all!"

16:28.458 --> 16:30.708
Come to Gorgeous, pretty boy!

16:30.708 --> 16:32.583
Gambit likes to
play hard to get!

16:36.166 --> 16:38.375
You’ve got to play
harder than that!

16:38.375 --> 16:39.708
(SCREAMING)

16:41.833 --> 16:44.083
(GROANING)

16:44.083 --> 16:45.875
Gambit!
Keep your sticky fingers

16:45.875 --> 16:48.958
to yourself,
you walking tar pit!

16:48.958 --> 16:52.833
Oh!
You wouldn’t say that
if you knew me better!

16:52.833 --> 16:54.458
(GRUNTING)

16:54.458 --> 16:55.500
Whoa!

16:59.291 --> 17:01.250
Hey, Gorgeous!
Where are the...

17:02.416 --> 17:03.708
(SLAB GAGS)

17:03.708 --> 17:05.333
(SLAB GROANING)

17:05.333 --> 17:06.625
(SHRIEKING)

17:07.291 --> 17:08.500
(GRUNTS)

17:09.875 --> 17:11.083
(GROANS)

17:12.750 --> 17:14.708
(SNARLING)

17:16.875 --> 17:19.166
(INHALES DEEPLY)

17:19.166 --> 17:23.291
"The noblest answer
unto such is kindly silence
when they brawl."

17:23.291 --> 17:24.875
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

17:24.875 --> 17:25.875
RUCKUS: Whoa!

17:25.875 --> 17:27.208
(SNARLING)

17:28.708 --> 17:30.750
We practiced
with the B-team.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.875
Now it’s time
for the big game.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.083
(GRUNTS)

17:35.875 --> 17:38.500
I think you get your wish,
mon ami.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.708
You shall not interfere
with my greatest experiment!

17:45.458 --> 17:48.625
Morph!
You’ve got to help us!

17:48.625 --> 17:51.375
Look, whatever happened,
you’re still part of
the team!

17:51.375 --> 17:53.291
You’re still
one of the X-Men!

17:53.291 --> 17:56.958
One of the X-Men?

17:56.958 --> 18:01.708
The future belongs
to superior mutants,
the ones I shall create!

18:01.708 --> 18:03.875
None of you are necessary!

18:03.875 --> 18:08.625
You kept me alive!
And the evil
that’s in me!

18:08.625 --> 18:11.416
But the worst of us
still has some good!

18:16.708 --> 18:19.583
I should have let you die!

18:19.583 --> 18:20.708
(GASPS)

18:33.416 --> 18:34.583
(SIGHS)

18:37.250 --> 18:39.333
Leave him alone, Sinister!

18:39.333 --> 18:41.250
Your fight is with me!

18:41.250 --> 18:42.625
(GROANING)

18:43.958 --> 18:48.458
My body!
This is impossible!

18:48.458 --> 18:52.333
So, you like playing God
with mutants’ lives.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.250
Well, just keep away
from my friends!

18:56.333 --> 18:57.625
(SCREAMING)

19:00.333 --> 19:02.458
Ruckus! The plane!

19:05.708 --> 19:07.083
(GROANING)

19:19.125 --> 19:20.875
Yeah, go ahead, run.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.083
I’ll be watching for you.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.375
Cyclops,
are you all right?

19:26.375 --> 19:30.333
No, and I won’t be
until that scum
pays for what he’s done!

19:30.333 --> 19:33.458
Forget it, Scott.
We’re all okay.

19:34.416 --> 19:35.750
We’re going home.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.166
Unmarried.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.000
Still married
in our hearts.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.416
And to be married again,
one day.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.625
Where’s Morph?

19:48.166 --> 19:50.333
Morph, no! Come back!

19:50.333 --> 19:52.458
Let him go, Wolverine.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.375
Morph may be afraid
of what he would do
if he stays with us.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.958
He must learn to deal
with what he has become.

19:57.958 --> 20:02.458
He’s my friend.
He’s the only one who could
ever make me laugh.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.875
I’m not going to
desert him this time!

20:13.375 --> 20:17.458
XAVIER:
You seem well for
a dying man, Magneto.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.166
I’m disappointed.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.625
You’ve never resorted
to lies with me before.

20:21.625 --> 20:23.416
What do you mean?

20:23.416 --> 20:25.875
It was you
who had last words
to share with me!

20:27.708 --> 20:31.625
I sense the
lingering presence
of something sinister.

20:33.416 --> 20:36.583
Avalanche!
We’ve walked into a trap!

20:40.875 --> 20:43.833
(BOTH SCREAMING)
