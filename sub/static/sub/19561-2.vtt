00:18.976 --> 00:21.106
Kevin.

00:21.112 --> 00:23.112
Mrs. Salib, I'm...
I'm so sorry to bother you,

00:23.114 --> 00:25.214
but I was wondering
if I could...

00:25.217 --> 00:26.986
I know. It's so early,
and I hate to ask,

00:26.987 --> 00:28.815
but I-I have a big meeting
this morning,

00:28.820 --> 00:30.960
and I didn't have a chance
to get to the store, so...

00:47.005 --> 00:50.535
Mrs. Salib,
you are a lifesaver.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.785
Something's wrong.

01:01.786 --> 01:03.816
I was supposed to meet my source
at Hamdi market last night.

01:03.822 --> 01:05.282
He didn't show.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.190
I tried.
He's not picking up his phone.

01:11.562 --> 01:13.192
Okay, they're following me.

01:20.571 --> 01:21.741
Police!

02:06.117 --> 02:07.985
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

02:07.986 --> 02:10.786
Journalist. I'm...
I'm a journalist.

02:19.063 --> 02:23.333
Mr. Jensen, welcome
to Tariq prison.

02:23.335 --> 02:26.804
I suggest you make yourself
at home.

02:26.805 --> 02:29.605
My name is commander Bahar.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.676
I'll be overseeing
your interrogation.

02:32.677 --> 02:34.677
Interrogation?

02:34.679 --> 02:36.979
No. No, wait. Listen. I don't
know who you think I am.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.872
We know exactly who you are.

02:38.883 --> 02:41.113
Kevin Jensen, journalist.

02:43.087 --> 02:45.887
<i>Sahafi. S-Sahafi.</i>

02:47.325 --> 02:49.255
Yes. Reporter.

02:49.260 --> 02:52.196
Yes. I'm an international
correspondent

02:52.197 --> 02:54.127
for the <i> empire times</i>
in New York.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.832
I'm in Kyrkistan to cover...

02:55.834 --> 02:57.264
objectively cover...

02:57.268 --> 02:58.838
what some people are saying...

02:58.839 --> 03:00.337
human rights violations by y...

03:02.306 --> 03:06.206
as you can see,
I've been reading your work.

03:06.211 --> 03:10.848
Stories about
oppressed students in China.

03:10.849 --> 03:12.783
"Missing mustard gas

03:12.784 --> 03:16.684
stolen by extremists
in Libya."

03:16.688 --> 03:22.183
All very convincing.
But also a lie.

03:22.193 --> 03:24.823
You say you come here to report.

03:24.829 --> 03:29.939
This is true, but not as a
journalist for an American paper.

03:32.870 --> 03:36.410
As an operative for the CIA.

03:37.408 --> 03:40.108
CIA?

03:40.111 --> 03:42.913
Come on.
You don't really believe that.

03:42.914 --> 03:45.344
Go ahead. Call my editor.
I...

03:45.350 --> 03:47.450
I have a degree
from the school of journalism

03:47.452 --> 03:49.882
at Boston university. I...

03:55.025 --> 03:56.825
I want a lawyer.

03:56.828 --> 03:58.158
And I want a phone call.

03:58.163 --> 03:59.893
And I assert the rights
afforded to the press

03:59.898 --> 04:02.398
by the humanitarian law
set forth by article...

04:10.941 --> 04:14.745
I don't care about
the government's policy, Walter.

04:14.746 --> 04:17.046
We're talking about my son.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.384
If there's a way to pay
for his release,

04:20.385 --> 04:22.215
then look into it, Walter.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.020
We should be exploring
every option.

04:27.192 --> 04:29.792
That was the family lawyer.

04:29.794 --> 04:31.824
He's skiing in Aspen.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.400
Meryl, I am so sorry.

04:38.268 --> 04:41.068
Kevin's paper's been fantastic.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.802
I spoke with
the editor in chief.

04:43.808 --> 04:46.777
She promises to use every
resource at her disposal.

04:46.778 --> 04:48.178
What's the state department
saying?

04:49.780 --> 04:51.980
Their intelligence confirms.

04:51.983 --> 04:54.113
He's being charged
with espionage.

04:54.119 --> 04:57.187
Kevin's not a spy, Scottie.

04:57.188 --> 04:59.757
You know him as well as anyone.
And I don't understand.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.028
Don't they have to tell us what
evidence they're relying on?

05:02.029 --> 05:04.126
No, not in their system.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.429
There's no formal arraignment,
no written charges,

05:06.431 --> 05:07.501
no right to council.

05:07.502 --> 05:09.767
But he will get a trial?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.898
If you can call it that.

05:11.903 --> 05:13.833
There are no witnesses called.

05:13.838 --> 05:16.076
He won't be allowed
to make statements.

05:16.077 --> 05:19.774
Generally, the judge just reviews
the government's case in chambers

05:19.778 --> 05:22.078
and reaches a verdict.
When will that happen?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.450
I don't know.
They won't give notice.

05:23.451 --> 05:26.483
Could be a day,
could be a few years.

05:26.484 --> 05:30.484
The man I spoke with... uh, his
name is Jerry Langsfeld. He...

05:30.488 --> 05:34.088
he's the under secretary for civilian
security, democracy, and human rights.

05:34.092 --> 05:36.222
He said state was working

05:36.227 --> 05:39.127
with the FBI,
doing everything they can.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.830
I told him, "you can send
a black hawk with a seal team"

05:41.833 --> 05:43.463
and go get my kid.
That's what you can do."

05:43.468 --> 05:45.806
Let me get you some water.
"That won't be possible."

05:45.807 --> 05:49.064
That's what he said. Like I'd asked
him if Tuesday was good for dinner.

05:49.073 --> 05:53.003
Jerry's a nice guy,
but he's not calling the shots.

05:53.011 --> 05:55.921
There are others
I can reach out to.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.983
Thank you.

05:59.984 --> 06:01.414
I'm just...

06:04.922 --> 06:06.322
Kevin loves you so much.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.556
And I don't know
what I'd do without you.

06:11.562 --> 06:13.192
Hey. Hey.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.269
I'll get him back.

06:20.137 --> 06:21.467
Welcome, players.

06:21.472 --> 06:23.172
For those of you
joining our game in progress,

06:23.174 --> 06:25.004
today we'll be talking
about Kyrkistan,

06:25.009 --> 06:28.378
the brutal and unseasonably
chilly nation-state

06:28.379 --> 06:30.619
located on the eastern border
of Turkey.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.615
- Leaving when?
- TBD.

06:32.617 --> 06:35.085
Scottie just said to have
everyone stand ready.

06:35.086 --> 06:36.916
Please tell me we're
going to get Kevin Jensen.

06:36.921 --> 06:38.521
You know him?
No, but I know his work.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.853
He's one of the best investigative
journalists we have.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.328
He'll do anything for the story.

06:42.329 --> 06:44.096
Yeah, well, he picked
a pretty insane time

06:44.097 --> 06:45.455
to go sniffing around Kyrkistan.

06:45.463 --> 06:47.163
The country's run by this guy...

06:47.165 --> 06:48.995
president Ahmed Aberjan.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.638
He's supposed to be up for
re-election in six weeks,

06:50.639 --> 06:52.365
but I guess he didn't like
how the polls were tracking

06:52.370 --> 06:54.137
because he decided
not to risk it.

06:54.138 --> 06:56.278
Instead, he cracked down
on the rival political party.

06:56.279 --> 06:58.074
Mm, doesn't sound
very Democratic.

06:58.076 --> 06:59.406
Put the whole country
on lockdown.

06:59.410 --> 07:01.110
Tens of thousands
have been arrested.

07:01.112 --> 07:03.912
Police, military,
judges, students...

07:03.915 --> 07:06.115
journalists. He's taking out
anyone who doesn't support him.

07:06.117 --> 07:08.547
So botTom line, it won't be
easy getting in undetected.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.013
Especially with the weaponry
needed for a rescue mission.

07:11.022 --> 07:12.516
Well, getting in
is only the beginning.

07:12.523 --> 07:14.053
We still have to rescue Jensen

07:14.058 --> 07:15.558
from a maximum-security prison

07:15.560 --> 07:18.899
and get him and our team
out of the country safely.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.467
Not that that doesn't sound
thrilling, but...

07:21.468 --> 07:23.366
How the hell
are we supposed to do that?

07:23.368 --> 07:25.468
You don't.
Fine. Then you do it.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.104
Absolutely not.

07:27.105 --> 07:29.005
Look, Aberjan's
on the warpath right now.

07:29.007 --> 07:31.407
The man's paranoid, angry,
and we're on the long list

07:31.409 --> 07:33.579
of enemies he's pointing the finger at.
- That's ridiculous.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.578
We supported his regime. Yeah, well,
apparently not to his satisfaction.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.451
He's making threats, and we're doing
everything we can to appease him.

07:39.452 --> 07:41.650
You're letting him railroad
an American civilian.

07:41.653 --> 07:44.083
Kevin Jensen's not CIA.
Come on.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.688
This kid's like family to me.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.630
And we will employ
every diplomatic resource

07:47.631 --> 07:49.125
to bring him home.

07:49.127 --> 07:50.957
I'm sorry, Scottie.
I really am.

07:50.962 --> 07:53.222
But you know the deal.
We need Aberjan.

07:53.231 --> 07:55.531
We've got our hands full fighting
extremists in the region.

07:55.533 --> 07:57.433
To do that, our military
needs safe passage

07:57.435 --> 07:59.135
across Kyrkistani airspace.

07:59.137 --> 08:00.667
If I send in a black-ops team

08:00.672 --> 08:03.002
to forcibly extract Jensen,

08:03.007 --> 08:05.676
Aberjan will close the airspace,
and the president will fire me,

08:05.677 --> 08:07.945
and he'd be right to do so.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.376
I don't need your permission.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.014
Now, you listen.

08:11.015 --> 08:13.215
Your government is telling you
to stand down.

08:13.217 --> 08:15.217
I'll say that again

08:15.219 --> 08:17.189
so that you don't someday argue
to some congressional committee

08:17.190 --> 08:18.388
that I was unclear.

08:18.389 --> 08:21.458
Stand down.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.059
They're torturing him, Bob.

08:23.061 --> 08:24.398
You know how they operate.

08:24.399 --> 08:27.095
They'll coerce a confession
and execute him.

08:27.098 --> 08:29.198
That's if he survives
the interrogation.

09:14.177 --> 09:15.777
My name is Kevin Jensen.

09:21.685 --> 09:24.585
I entered this country
claiming to be a journalist

09:24.589 --> 09:27.024
working for the <i> empire times</i>

09:27.025 --> 09:29.695
as an international
correspondent, but...

09:32.529 --> 09:34.069
That was not the truth.

09:37.567 --> 09:40.504
The truth is I am
a deep-cover operative

09:40.505 --> 09:43.535
for the central
intelligence agency.

09:46.076 --> 09:48.746
I apologize
to the Kyrkistani people.

09:51.281 --> 09:53.551
I pray for their understanding,
and now...

09:56.319 --> 09:57.519
For their mercy.

10:04.828 --> 10:07.098
None of that was true.

10:08.532 --> 10:11.132
You know that.
I'm a reporter.<i> Sahafi.</i>

10:12.302 --> 10:15.202
Your denials are an insult.

10:16.306 --> 10:18.606
There will be no mercy.

10:18.609 --> 10:23.246
In time, you will be executed
for your crimes.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.417
But I said
what you wanted me to say.

10:25.418 --> 10:27.784
You say what you are...

10:27.785 --> 10:29.715
Not because I want you to...

10:31.455 --> 10:33.385
But because this is the truth.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.500
Please...

10:43.633 --> 10:46.233
Please don't...

10:46.237 --> 10:48.667
No. Please don't do this.

10:51.205 --> 10:54.344
<i>I entered this country
claiming to be a journalist</i>

10:54.345 --> 10:56.143
<i>working for the</i> Empire Times

10:56.145 --> 10:58.815
<i>as an international

11:01.716 --> 11:03.486
<i>That was not the truth.</i>

11:17.398 --> 11:20.068
<i>Hi, honey. As you can see,
I'm here at the Jensen house.</i>

11:20.069 --> 11:22.069
<i>I know you're
somewhere across the world</i>

11:22.071 --> 11:23.801
<i>saving us from god knows what,</i>

11:23.806 --> 11:26.576
<i>but I thought you should know
today is a very big day</i>

11:26.577 --> 11:27.805
<i>here too.</i>

11:27.810 --> 11:30.545
<i>Aunt Scottie, watch this!</i>

11:30.546 --> 11:33.446
<i>That's right.
No training wheels.</i>

11:36.418 --> 11:37.658
<i>Kevin, be careful.</i>

11:37.659 --> 11:39.353
<i>I'm okay.</i>

11:50.698 --> 11:52.837
Scottie, everyone's standing by.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.705
What do you want me
to tell them?

11:57.705 --> 12:00.274
I lost my son, Christopher,
when he was four.

12:00.275 --> 12:03.544
He and Kevin were
in the same preschool class...

12:03.545 --> 12:06.745
blue room... a lifetime ago.

12:06.748 --> 12:09.487
When Christopher disappeared,
when I lost my family,

12:09.488 --> 12:11.554
the Jensens made me
part of theirs.

12:11.555 --> 12:13.353
Kevin's not my child, but...

12:16.657 --> 12:18.496
If I leave him there, he'll die.

12:18.497 --> 12:19.724
Diplomacy won't save him.

12:19.728 --> 12:21.262
He'll be executed,

12:21.263 --> 12:23.223
and we won't know
until it's over.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.863
With Howard gone, everyone's
watching what you do now,

12:28.871 --> 12:30.731
and ordering
an unsanctioned black op

12:30.739 --> 12:32.439
on enemy soil

12:32.441 --> 12:35.401
is going to make
a lot of people very nervous.

12:35.410 --> 12:36.910
Where are we on infiltration?

12:36.912 --> 12:38.912
There's a plan.
It's awaiting your approval.

12:41.849 --> 12:43.818
Let me be clear.
The administration

12:43.819 --> 12:47.655
has specifically instructed
halcyon to stand down.

12:47.656 --> 12:49.526
For that reason,
what I'm asking you to do

12:49.527 --> 12:51.194
is even more dangerous
and illegal

12:51.195 --> 12:52.893
than most of the Grey matters
we take on.

12:52.895 --> 12:54.825
You know Jensen and his family?

12:54.830 --> 12:57.270
Very well. Kevin and my son,
Christopher, were friends.

12:57.271 --> 12:59.196
They were?

12:59.201 --> 13:03.201
Yes, and I've remained
close with him and his family.

13:03.205 --> 13:04.674
Look, this is personal for me.

13:04.675 --> 13:06.673
I'm not hiding that,
and I realize that fact

13:06.675 --> 13:08.475
may be clouding my judgment,

13:08.477 --> 13:09.846
but I won't leave him there.

13:09.847 --> 13:11.845
You all have to make
your own decision.

13:11.847 --> 13:13.447
If you want out,
you have my word

13:13.448 --> 13:15.418
there won't be any reprisals.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.717
But if you do,
I need to know now.

13:22.790 --> 13:24.500
So, how do we get in?

13:25.927 --> 13:27.895
Our journey begins
with the European union.

13:27.896 --> 13:29.466
They got a partnership
and cooperation agreement

13:29.467 --> 13:31.334
with Kyrkistan,
but president Aberjan

13:31.335 --> 13:33.433
has been acting like
a real dictator lately.

13:33.435 --> 13:35.335
So that relationship's
a bit dicey.

13:35.337 --> 13:36.506
The Eu wants a meeting.

13:36.507 --> 13:38.635
Under pressure,
Aberjan has agreed

13:38.640 --> 13:40.910
to make some low-level
foreign ministers available.

13:40.911 --> 13:42.443
Which we thought
was an opportunity.

13:42.444 --> 13:43.604
I agree.
Who are they sending?

13:43.612 --> 13:44.972
You mean,
"who were they sending?"

13:44.980 --> 13:47.280
Two special envoys...
one Dutch, one German.

13:47.282 --> 13:48.582
These were submitted
electronically

13:48.584 --> 13:50.414
to Kyrkistan for pre-approval
a few hours ago.

13:50.419 --> 13:51.719
Of course I intercepted them.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.890
We propose to send
these instead,

13:53.891 --> 13:56.329
along with a request to hold
the meeting up by 48 hours.

13:56.330 --> 13:57.892
Call me Omar Claasen.

13:57.893 --> 13:59.593
<i>Trained in law at the Hague,</i>

13:59.595 --> 14:01.465
<i>four years as a special
representative in Ankara,</i>

14:01.466 --> 14:02.723
two in Brussels.

14:02.731 --> 14:05.261
...Helen Gruner,

14:05.267 --> 14:07.737
<i>most recently a part
of the EU delegation</i>

14:07.738 --> 14:10.336
<i>to Afghanistan.</i>
I like it.

14:10.339 --> 14:12.807
<i>When you deplane, you'll be
met by a government liaison.</i>

14:12.808 --> 14:15.008
He'll check your credentials
against the ones we pre-cleared.

14:15.010 --> 14:16.777
Mr. Claasen, Ms. Gruner.

14:16.778 --> 14:19.247
Welcome to Kyrkistan.
Documents, please.

14:19.248 --> 14:20.986
<i>And what if something
goes wrong?</i>

14:20.987 --> 14:24.613
If it does, you're on your own.
There's no backup this time.

14:35.830 --> 14:36.830
Uh-oh.

14:41.836 --> 14:44.736
If things pop off, we take down
these two, go back the way we came,

14:44.740 --> 14:46.280
try to get back to the tarmac.
Mm-hmm.

14:51.279 --> 14:53.579
Is there a problem?
Security matter.

14:53.582 --> 14:56.012
I assumed it would be acceptable to
review your credentials here at the gate.

14:56.018 --> 14:57.818
I was wrong.

14:57.819 --> 14:59.819
My superior insisted on
inspecting them personally.

15:04.358 --> 15:06.327
It appears everything's
in order.

15:06.328 --> 15:08.828
If you follow me, I will
escort you to a hotel. <i>Danke.</i>

15:08.830 --> 15:11.999
- Yes.
- <i>Once you land, the clock's ticking.</i>

15:12.000 --> 15:14.610
You have to be out before
the real Eu envoys show up

15:14.611 --> 15:16.333
and your cover is blown.

15:16.338 --> 15:17.338
What about weapons?

15:17.339 --> 15:18.639
Weapons are my job.
Dumont

15:18.640 --> 15:20.340
thinks that we can just, uh...

15:20.342 --> 15:21.672
Drive them right across
the border.

15:21.677 --> 15:23.507
How? What are we
hiding them in?

15:23.512 --> 15:25.912
There's a trucking company
called Kyrkistan logistics.

15:25.914 --> 15:27.544
Twice a week, they drive
supplies and equipment

15:27.549 --> 15:29.016
across the border to Armenia,

15:29.017 --> 15:30.547
where they're unloaded
and come back empty.

15:30.552 --> 15:32.052
All I have to do
is seize control

15:32.054 --> 15:34.354
of the truck in Armenia,
load the weapons,

15:34.356 --> 15:37.026
and then drive it back
across the border undetected.

15:37.027 --> 15:39.095
Forget it. They'll inspect
the truck on return.

15:39.096 --> 15:42.324
How do we hide assault rifles and
body armor in an empty truck?

15:42.331 --> 15:45.991
It's my personal spin on what
scientists call a Rochester cloak.

15:46.001 --> 15:48.431
It was developed at the university
of Rochester, although...

15:48.437 --> 15:50.637
They never did it
quite like this.

15:50.639 --> 15:52.108
So it's a cloaking device?

15:52.109 --> 15:54.345
Kinda. More of
a system than a device.

15:54.346 --> 15:57.373
Bottom line, it uses a pre-standing
array of mirrors and lenses

15:57.379 --> 15:59.619
to bend light around objects
you want to hide.

16:03.451 --> 16:04.981
Looks empty.

16:04.986 --> 16:06.686
That's the idea.

16:06.688 --> 16:08.058
But go ahead, step inside.

16:12.426 --> 16:14.426
The light coming off
the back wall

16:14.429 --> 16:16.767
is literally bent around
the boxes at the center

16:16.768 --> 16:18.765
and projected
to the eye unbroken.

16:20.701 --> 16:22.501
Tasty.

16:22.504 --> 16:25.074
Okay, let's do some recon
on the driver.

16:25.075 --> 16:27.033
<i>His name is Evren Margosian.</i>

16:27.042 --> 16:29.942
<i>He delivers a shipment
in Armenia at 7:00 A.M.</i>

16:29.945 --> 16:31.775
Now, we've mapped out
his return route,

16:31.780 --> 16:33.980
which generally includes
a truck stop

16:33.982 --> 16:36.012
about 20 minutes
from the border.

16:36.017 --> 16:37.887
That's where
you'll need to take him.

16:46.727 --> 16:49.666
<i>Once you have the truck, you'll
take it to an arranged location.</i>

16:49.667 --> 16:52.733
<i>We have people standing by to configure
the cloak and load the gear.</i>

16:52.734 --> 16:54.604
<i>From there,
you just have to drive.</i>

16:54.605 --> 16:56.133
How's your Arabic?

17:13.753 --> 17:15.154
Hmm.

17:25.833 --> 17:26.933
<i>We're in.</i>

17:26.935 --> 17:28.135
Not bad.

17:49.824 --> 17:51.724
<i>Sit tight. You're fine.</i>

17:53.594 --> 17:55.124
Uh-oh.

17:55.130 --> 17:57.630
He didn't see anything.
He just got distracted.

17:57.632 --> 17:59.462
<i>They're talking about something else.</i>
He left the frickin' door open.

17:59.468 --> 18:01.535
Is that a problem?
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

18:01.536 --> 18:03.866
The air in the truck is a lot
warmer than the air outside.

18:03.872 --> 18:06.532
What happens when a mass of cold
air meets a mass of warm air?

18:06.541 --> 18:08.871
<i>The condensation is going
to break the illusion.</i>

18:16.083 --> 18:17.743
You're burned.
Get out of there!

18:23.606 --> 18:25.406
I made it across.

18:25.409 --> 18:27.149
<i>I'm on foot, about
a mile inside the border.</i>

18:27.150 --> 18:28.544
Thank god.

18:28.545 --> 18:29.845
Question is, what now, Tom-Tom?

18:29.847 --> 18:31.577
<i>We just lost all our weapons.</i>

18:31.582 --> 18:34.819
Yeah. And to replace them,
we're gonna need a contact

18:34.820 --> 18:36.988
<i>with access
to military-grade gear.</i>

18:36.989 --> 18:39.555
Hang on. Hang on.
I might know someone.

18:39.556 --> 18:41.126
He's not a soldier,
but he makes a living

18:41.127 --> 18:42.585
by getting people
what they need.

18:42.593 --> 18:44.723
<i>I'll send the address.</i>
- Okay.

18:46.763 --> 18:48.163
Yes, yes.

18:49.866 --> 18:52.666
Your man just got here, Scottie.

18:52.669 --> 18:53.969
You could have saved him
the trip.

18:53.971 --> 18:56.539
Volkan, darling,
this is no time to be shy.

18:56.540 --> 18:59.180
<i>You're one of the most powerful
men in the Kyrkistani underworld.</i>

18:59.181 --> 19:01.106
Surely you can get what we need.

19:01.111 --> 19:04.046
<i>Under normal circumstances, yes,</i>

19:04.047 --> 19:07.417
but things right now,
they're anything but normal.

19:07.418 --> 19:09.948
Many of my associates
have been arrested.

19:09.953 --> 19:12.613
Many of my assets
have been seized.

19:12.623 --> 19:15.553
In fact, the only reason
I myself was not arrested

19:15.559 --> 19:19.659
is because I maintain high-level
contacts within the national police.

19:19.663 --> 19:22.563
Name your price. <i>I don't
think I need to tell you</i>

19:22.566 --> 19:27.003
what the government would do
to my family, to my business,

19:27.004 --> 19:30.473
if your people were caught and
connected to me. <i>They won't be.</i>

19:30.474 --> 19:31.834
You're expanding
into real estate,

19:31.842 --> 19:34.002
developing areas destroyed
by regional fighting.

19:34.011 --> 19:35.811
What if I get you contracts?

19:35.813 --> 19:37.773
American government contracts?

19:37.781 --> 19:40.076
<i>No, no, no,</i>
now you're overreaching.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.143
Even Howard
could not get that done.

19:42.152 --> 19:43.582
Try me.

19:43.587 --> 19:45.187
You and Howard were associates.

19:45.189 --> 19:47.059
<i>I'm suggesting we be friends.</i>

19:47.060 --> 19:50.057
Okay, friend, truth be told,

19:50.060 --> 19:53.629
there is one contract
I am interested in.

19:53.630 --> 19:55.598
My daughter is a singer.

19:55.599 --> 19:59.199
She loves
your American pop music.

19:59.203 --> 20:00.733
I want a record deal

20:00.737 --> 20:03.137
<i>with an American label,
album release,</i>

20:03.140 --> 20:04.574
national tour.

20:04.575 --> 20:06.735
I'm not a record executive.

20:06.743 --> 20:08.943
But you know people who are.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.876
Hey, you ask me what I want.

20:11.882 --> 20:13.742
That is what I want.

20:16.152 --> 20:18.252
Fine. I'll...
I'll get her a deal.

20:18.255 --> 20:20.085
But no guarantee on a tour.

20:20.090 --> 20:22.060
<i>I mean, how do I even know
if she's any good?</i>

20:57.527 --> 20:59.857
Fantastic. Really.

20:59.863 --> 21:01.523
So good.

21:01.532 --> 21:06.592
Thank you. Thank you for
indulging a proud papa.

21:06.603 --> 21:09.603
Brava! Brava!

21:16.279 --> 21:20.049
You're kidding, right?
That... that's everything?

21:20.050 --> 21:23.219
I told you. Most of my
stockpile has been seized.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.220
These two are empty?
Yes.

21:25.222 --> 21:27.282
I don't think our good friend
Volkan understands.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.631
We're talking about an assault
on a maximum-security prison.

21:29.632 --> 21:31.994
We won't get past the perimeter

21:31.995 --> 21:33.595
with two rifles.

21:33.597 --> 21:36.127
We need night vision.
We need body armor,

21:36.133 --> 21:37.763
grenade... I don't know if we
need night vision goggles...

21:37.768 --> 21:40.068
You don't want it? Fine.
We're done here.

21:40.070 --> 21:43.010
No, no, no, no, no. We didn't say that, all
right? It's just not what we expected.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.236
Give... give us a minute.

21:46.809 --> 21:47.843
Ungrateful.

21:47.844 --> 21:50.674
I am risking my life here.

21:50.681 --> 21:54.750
These days, even the rumor that you
spoke critically of the president

21:54.751 --> 21:57.021
is enough to get you thrown
into a cell.

21:57.022 --> 21:58.920
Yeah,

21:58.922 --> 22:01.182
that could work to our advantage.
How?

22:01.191 --> 22:02.991
You said you had friends
in the national police?

22:02.993 --> 22:04.723
Yes. Could they get
us uniforms and gear?

22:04.728 --> 22:06.758
Of course. Why?

22:06.763 --> 22:09.163
What if someone told
the national police

22:09.166 --> 22:11.296
that the warden and his staff
at Tariq prison

22:11.301 --> 22:13.841
were supporting Aberjan's rival
in the upcoming election?

22:13.842 --> 22:18.174
I imagine emergency warrants
would issue for their arrest.

22:18.175 --> 22:20.105
We could piggyback on that,
right?

22:20.110 --> 22:21.180
Walk right through
the front door.

22:21.181 --> 22:22.778
We need a vehicle.

22:22.779 --> 22:24.319
But that could work.
Attaboy. Hmm.

22:28.784 --> 22:30.284
Naz, you've got a right turn

22:30.287 --> 22:32.655
coming up in three, two...

22:32.656 --> 22:34.186
Roger that.

22:34.191 --> 22:35.191
We're all set.

22:35.192 --> 22:36.382
Volkan's sources confirm

22:36.393 --> 22:37.953
arrest warrants were issued

22:37.961 --> 22:40.161
<i>for the warden
and 16 of his employees.</i>

22:40.163 --> 22:41.693
Convoy's tracking
south to north.

22:41.698 --> 22:42.828
According to this,

22:42.833 --> 22:44.063
you're headed straight for it.

22:44.067 --> 22:47.136
Stand by. Go for siren.
Copy that.

22:47.137 --> 22:48.404
<i>Right.</i>

22:48.405 --> 22:50.135
Now, sweet cheeks!

22:56.679 --> 22:57.719
<i>We are in position.</i>

23:01.884 --> 23:03.214
East exit.
If we get him out,

23:03.220 --> 23:04.860
it won't do much good
without a ride.

23:04.861 --> 23:06.215
I'll be there.

23:17.733 --> 23:19.033
<i>All right. We're inside.</i>

23:19.036 --> 23:20.196
Best guess, Jensen's being held

23:20.203 --> 23:21.433
in the northeast quadrant.

23:40.156 --> 23:41.956
Good. Moving east.

23:41.958 --> 23:43.858
I see the corridor
to the northeast quadrant.

24:02.078 --> 24:03.248
Jensen.

24:07.249 --> 24:08.289
Kevin Jensen?

24:09.752 --> 24:11.282
We got him.
He's alive.

24:11.288 --> 24:12.958
<i>Just hang on.</i>

24:14.757 --> 24:16.457
<i>Okay. Get back.</i>

24:33.310 --> 24:35.810
Whoever that was is gonna
come looking for him.

24:35.812 --> 24:38.852
Yeah, we need to keep moving, or none
of us are going to make it out of here.

24:42.581 --> 24:43.911
We are Oscar Mike.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.586
Be advised, our cover is blown.

24:45.587 --> 24:47.885
<i>We are heading
for the northwest exit.</i>

24:47.887 --> 24:49.287
Had to neutralize an unfriendly.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.888
At this point,
it's only a matter of time

24:50.890 --> 24:52.090
before the police come
and discover the body.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.921
<i>Nez...</i>
- Yeah, I heard.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.926
I'm repositioning now.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.736
There it is.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.078
All right. You're okay.
You're okay.

25:10.141 --> 25:12.841
Dumont, are you seeing this?
We need another way out.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.115
They found your unfriendly.
It's not just where you are.

25:15.116 --> 25:19.384
The whole building's going into
emergency lockdown. We're boxed in.

25:19.385 --> 25:22.055
Forward exit's blocked, and we
can't go back the way we came.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.252
Hey, Dumont, we're gonna take
this chance here.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.228
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.064
We're in the kitchen, Dumont.
Where the hell are we going?

25:33.065 --> 25:35.803
<i>I'm on it. Looks like there's
a way out at the far end.</i>

25:35.804 --> 25:37.831
There should be a storage room
on your right

25:37.837 --> 25:40.237
that leads out to an exit door.
<i>Got it.</i>

25:40.239 --> 25:41.839
Yeah.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.211
It's not working.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.386
Dumont, I'm looking
at a security keypad.

25:51.387 --> 25:52.951
<i>How many numbers?</i>

25:52.952 --> 25:54.782
Six.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.121
Son of a bitch.

25:56.122 --> 25:59.122
Okay, I can try
to override remotely.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.755
<i>That's gonna take time, brother.</i>

26:01.894 --> 26:03.694
Come on.

26:43.968 --> 26:45.438
Aah!

26:53.011 --> 26:56.081
Tom? Solomon, talk to me.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.342
We're pinned down.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.882
I'm out.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.855
Stay here.
What are you doing?

27:16.801 --> 27:18.971
Can't hold them
like this forever.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.442
The keypad... how many is that?
Four.

27:22.443 --> 27:26.071
<i>Dumont,
I hate to rush you, buddy,</i>

27:26.078 --> 27:28.048
but in about 20 seconds,
we're about to be overrun.

27:28.049 --> 27:29.817
<i>I'm trying.</i>

27:31.951 --> 27:33.181
That's five.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.085
<i>Come on, Dumont.
One more.</i>

27:35.087 --> 27:37.287
Not gonna make it.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.919
<i>Well, then, neither will we.</i>

27:45.163 --> 27:46.293
Here comes number six.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.874
Let's move!

28:18.229 --> 28:19.489
You have news?

28:19.498 --> 28:22.068
We found Kevin.
He's alive and stable.

28:22.069 --> 28:23.201
Oh, thank god!

28:23.202 --> 28:24.362
I-it's not over.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.500
He's not out of the country yet,

28:25.504 --> 28:27.934
but, uh, he's with my people.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.170
We're bringing him home.

28:30.176 --> 28:33.816
Scottie, the chief of staff's on the
phone for you. Excuse me one moment.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.255
- What the hell did you do?
<i>- Sorry, Bob,</i>

28:39.256 --> 28:41.451
but you're gonna need to be
a little more specific.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.553
You know perfectly well
what I'm talking about.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.426
Why are my assets in Kyrkistan
telling me about a firefight

28:46.427 --> 28:48.525
at the prison where
Kevin Jensen is being held?

28:48.527 --> 28:51.296
I think you mean,
<i>was</i> being held.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.264
I told you to stand down.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.265
<i>And I told you I didn't need
your permission.</i>

28:55.267 --> 28:57.205
Halcyon is
an independent entity.

28:57.206 --> 28:59.903
Howard founded it that way,
ran it that way.

28:59.905 --> 29:03.074
And he may be gone, but that
hasn't changed. <i>I swear, Scottie,</i>

29:03.075 --> 29:04.975
if our relationship
with Aberjan crumbles

29:04.977 --> 29:08.477
so you could rescue a civilian
for personal reasons,

29:08.480 --> 29:10.040
you're done.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.439
<i>You could be indicted for this.</i>

29:11.450 --> 29:14.280
Oh, please.
We're way past that, Bob.

29:14.286 --> 29:18.486
<i>The things I know? The things halcyon
has done in the name of this country?</i>

29:18.490 --> 29:20.250
<i>This administration?</i>

29:20.259 --> 29:23.219
We are the very definition
of "too big to fail."

29:23.229 --> 29:25.459
You can't afford to make us
an enemy. You need us.

29:25.464 --> 29:29.033
<i>So please spare me the
selective memory and morality.</i>

29:29.034 --> 29:30.364
Now you do sound like Howard.

29:33.504 --> 29:36.074
Look. What's done is done,

29:36.075 --> 29:38.145
and the truth, is I could use
an assist at this point.

29:38.146 --> 29:40.143
<i>So please tell your boss</i>

29:40.145 --> 29:42.614
he can either abandon Jensen
and my people over there,

29:42.615 --> 29:45.415
or step up and be
part of the solution.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.495
We're working on
a new exfiltration plan.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.265
So, we'll get you home,
just a few hours.

30:00.266 --> 30:03.301
Wait. No, we can't just leave.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.032
I came here to report
on human rights violations.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.438
My camera and my laptop are all still
at the building where I was staying.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.440
I need to go get them.
Absolutely not.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.072
The entire government's
looking for us.

30:12.077 --> 30:13.477
And we're basically
down to handguns.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.079
Please. The people I spoke
with, the victims...

30:16.081 --> 30:18.081
they deserve to have
their stories heard.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.483
They spoke to me
at great personal risk.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.985
If I don't have my notes
and my recordings,

30:20.986 --> 30:23.224
all of this was for nothing.
Nez is right.

30:23.225 --> 30:26.252
The apartment's the first place
they're gonna look.

30:26.258 --> 30:30.228
I'm sorry, man. It's just
not a risk we can take.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.289
No, of course. I get it.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.498
You guys have... you guys have
done enough already.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.560
Safety has to be the priority.

30:40.571 --> 30:43.001
All right.
Today must be our lucky day.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.208
Government didn't approve
of this mission,

30:45.210 --> 30:47.310
but now that it's done, they're not
gonna abandon us in hostile territory.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.713
So they're coming to get us?
No.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.414
Oh. But if we can make
it to our embassy,

30:50.416 --> 30:52.216
preferably without
being discovered,

30:52.217 --> 30:53.617
they'll stick us
on the next flight home.

30:53.619 --> 30:54.949
But it's not going to be easy.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.121
The embassy is 12 miles
from here.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.352
We just sit tight
till it's dark.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.226
Dumont will monitor
police activities.

31:00.227 --> 31:01.594
We just stay one step ahead.

31:01.595 --> 31:03.223
Stay on back roads,
keep out of sight.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.697
Still, it's going to be
a long 12 miles.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.038
Mm.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.667
Where's Jensen?

31:10.669 --> 31:12.369
He was just here.

31:26.800 --> 31:30.130
We risk our lives to go get
this guy, and he bolts on us?

31:30.137 --> 31:32.167
I guess you were right, Tom.
Anything for a story.

31:32.173 --> 31:34.711
Screw that. No story's worth
getting killed for.

31:34.712 --> 31:36.868
And I did not come all the way
out here for nothing.

31:36.877 --> 31:39.037
Well, now you know how he feels.

31:39.046 --> 31:41.506
Guy risks his life because
the work needs doing.

31:41.515 --> 31:45.525
I'm not saying he was right
to go, but... I get it.

31:48.521 --> 31:49.551
Kevin...

31:49.557 --> 31:50.557
Kevin!

31:52.092 --> 31:53.622
I'll be out of here
in two seconds, Mrs. Salib.

31:53.627 --> 31:55.057
Thank you.

32:05.905 --> 32:08.041
There's no sign
of Jensen out front.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.672
It's possible the police
were waiting for him.

32:09.677 --> 32:10.877
And us.

32:10.878 --> 32:12.638
Only one way to find out.

32:12.646 --> 32:14.106
Go. We'll keep watch
from here.

32:26.659 --> 32:27.829
What the hell are you doing,
huh?

32:27.830 --> 32:29.158
I told you we can't be here.

32:29.163 --> 32:31.803
I got what I came for.
Let's go.

32:35.069 --> 32:37.999
What do you think? I think we
should've been chiropractors.

32:38.005 --> 32:40.543
Or proctologists. Pretty
much anything else. Hm.

32:40.544 --> 32:43.141
Can't defend this position.
Let's go. Okay.

32:44.844 --> 32:46.584
We had to ditch the car. We got company.
How many?

32:46.585 --> 32:48.280
Too many.
Can we take them?

32:48.282 --> 32:50.182
No, I count six vehicles.
That's at least a dozen police

32:50.184 --> 32:51.984
and state security. We gotta
find a different way out.

32:51.986 --> 32:53.676
I know a way.
Follow me.

33:02.629 --> 33:04.799
Shh!

33:20.980 --> 33:22.950
Our apologies.

33:40.099 --> 33:42.068
<i>Dumont, there's been a change
in the program.</i>

33:42.069 --> 33:44.899
We're mobile and in some
serious trouble, my friend.

33:44.905 --> 33:48.312
What? No, no, no. You're supposed
to be sitting tight until dark.

33:48.313 --> 33:51.678
Yeah, you know, it turns out that
game plan was not unanimous.

33:51.679 --> 33:54.009
Had to call an audible. We're
travelling in a commandeered vehicle.

33:54.014 --> 33:56.883
I need you to get on the phone with the embassy
right now and tell them we're coming in.

33:56.884 --> 33:58.984
<i>On it.</i>
Guys.

34:01.689 --> 34:05.219
Yes, this is halcyon operator
one-niner, contract code 6-3-7,

34:05.225 --> 34:06.259
Sierra-2.

34:06.260 --> 34:07.960
Be advised, we are requesting

34:07.962 --> 34:10.092
early arrival of our package
at the northern gate.

34:10.097 --> 34:12.027
<i>Copy that, halcyon one-niner.</i>

34:12.032 --> 34:14.170
<i>Package will be arriving
momentarily,</i>

34:14.170 --> 34:15.668
<i>with authorities in pursuit.</i>

34:15.668 --> 34:17.168
There's a road block up ahead.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.940
All right. There's the gate.
We're almost there.

34:18.942 --> 34:21.009
What do I do? Should I stop?
Should I go back?

34:21.010 --> 34:23.338
- Back's not an option.
- There's nowhere to go.

34:23.344 --> 34:25.014
Brace yourselves!
We're gonna hit it!

34:25.014 --> 34:26.141
Down!

34:59.278 --> 35:01.008
Come on.
Get him inside.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.415
Where you going?
Get him inside. Take him.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.116
Keen, don't even
think about it. Keen.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.680
On presidential authority,

35:37.685 --> 35:39.154
we demand
the release Kevin Jensen

35:39.155 --> 35:40.987
and the fugitives
that helped him escape.

35:40.988 --> 35:42.449
I don't know anything
about that, commander.

35:42.456 --> 35:44.386
You send them out right now,
or we are coming in.

35:44.391 --> 35:46.021
Sir, if you take one more step,

35:46.026 --> 35:48.756
I am authorized by
my government to shoot you.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.169
What are you doing?

35:56.170 --> 35:59.300
What are you doing?
Come on. He can make it.

35:59.306 --> 36:01.036
He can make it.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.311
He can make it!

36:36.142 --> 36:38.742
This is how you preserve
our plausible deniability?

36:38.746 --> 36:40.476
With a gun battle and car chase?

36:40.481 --> 36:42.311
It couldn't be avoided.

36:42.316 --> 36:44.010
<i>I've got their ambassador
holding on the line.</i>

36:44.017 --> 36:46.017
<i>They're demanding
we hand over Jensen</i>

36:46.019 --> 36:47.789
<i>and your team.</i>

36:51.891 --> 36:53.521
Bob, I'm going to have
to call you back.

37:12.145 --> 37:14.115
<i>He didn't make it?</i>

37:17.250 --> 37:18.350
No.

37:48.582 --> 37:50.082
You two can go on in.

37:59.551 --> 38:03.251
Mrs. Hargrave,
I'm Rebecca Fuller,

38:03.256 --> 38:05.626
editor of the paper,
and this is...

38:05.627 --> 38:08.063
Robert Wilmont,
white house chief of staff;

38:08.064 --> 38:11.161
and Owen Pruitt, deputy
director of the CIA. We've met.

38:11.164 --> 38:14.264
Scottie, you have to believe me. I
didn't know until this morning.

38:14.267 --> 38:17.667
CIA? He was never
a journalist.

38:17.671 --> 38:19.371
He was an operative.

38:19.372 --> 38:21.202
This country considers him
a patriot.

38:21.207 --> 38:22.367
He never said anything.

38:22.375 --> 38:24.043
I'm not surprised.

38:24.044 --> 38:25.613
Kevin was one of our best.

38:25.614 --> 38:27.142
We recruited him
right out of school.

38:27.147 --> 38:29.177
Letting agents pose
as journalists

38:29.182 --> 38:30.582
puts real journalists at risk.

38:30.583 --> 38:32.518
It violates CIA policy.

38:32.519 --> 38:35.688
No. As a policy,
we avoid using journalists.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.489
Unless the director decides
it's absolutely necessary

38:39.492 --> 38:41.192
to protect national security.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.628
And this was?

38:42.629 --> 38:44.689
What was Kevin doing out there?

38:44.698 --> 38:47.228
Something that needed doing.

38:47.233 --> 38:48.663
I wish I could say more.

38:52.037 --> 38:56.067
I understand you are the one
who went back for these.

38:56.076 --> 38:58.676
You should know,
the material on this

38:58.678 --> 39:01.138
will save a lot
of American lives.

39:01.147 --> 39:03.677
You did a great service
bringing these home.

39:03.683 --> 39:06.283
Well, at least his family
can take comfort

39:06.286 --> 39:08.155
knowing he died
for something important.

39:08.156 --> 39:09.354
No, son, they can't.

39:11.256 --> 39:12.426
Oh, come on. Why not?

39:14.093 --> 39:17.129
The U.S. denied Kevin
was an asset.

39:17.130 --> 39:19.700
Admitting it now would destroy
any remaining chance

39:19.701 --> 39:21.359
of repairing relations
with Aberjan.

39:21.368 --> 39:22.728
It would also shine a spotlight

39:22.736 --> 39:24.476
on everyone Kevin
made contact with

39:24.477 --> 39:25.701
in the field.

39:25.705 --> 39:27.743
Other active agents
would be at risk.

39:27.744 --> 39:29.441
We can't have anyone thinking

39:29.442 --> 39:32.272
or saying anything other
than that he was a journalist.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.446
Are we clear?

39:35.448 --> 39:36.609
His mother's
one of my best friends.

39:36.616 --> 39:38.016
I won't lie to her.

39:38.018 --> 39:40.148
That's exactly
what you have to do.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.380
It's my fault.

40:13.652 --> 40:15.652
I thought going to get him
was the right thing to do.

40:15.655 --> 40:17.525
No, don't do that to yourself.

40:17.526 --> 40:19.391
I asked you to go.

40:19.392 --> 40:20.762
Kevin would've died there.

40:20.763 --> 40:23.630
What you did gave him
a fighting chance.

40:25.197 --> 40:28.127
He chose to go back,
and that was Kevin.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.674
Nothing was more important
than the story.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.604
If we had to lose him,

40:34.607 --> 40:36.237
at least I know he died

40:36.242 --> 40:37.842
doing what he loved the most.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.554
What is it?

40:45.384 --> 40:46.654
Nothing.

40:49.388 --> 40:52.658
I just can't believe
he's really gone.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.830
So you didn't tell his mother.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.300
No.

41:02.302 --> 41:03.469
Why not?

41:03.470 --> 41:04.800
I don't know.

41:04.804 --> 41:07.604
I... I, uh...

41:07.607 --> 41:10.137
I guess in the moment,
I just felt

41:10.143 --> 41:11.673
Kevin wouldn't
have wanted me to.

41:12.744 --> 41:14.644
Imagine, her own son,

41:14.647 --> 41:18.377
and she had no idea
who he really was.

41:23.622 --> 41:27.392
They can't all have
happy endings.

41:27.393 --> 41:29.663
Be proud of
what we did out there.

41:30.662 --> 41:33.902
I am.

41:43.576 --> 41:45.886
