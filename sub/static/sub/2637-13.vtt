00:01.065 --> 00:03.048
More details
about the new <i>Star Trek</i> film.

00:03.507 --> 00:06.897
{pos(192,220)}There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

00:07.545 --> 00:10.472
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

00:11.841 --> 00:12.779
Oh, please.

00:12.899 --> 00:16.274
For Vulcans, mating...
or if you will, PonFahr...

00:17.489 --> 00:21.002
- it's an extremely private matter.
- Still, I'd like to know the details.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.047
His mother was human.
His father is Vulcan.

00:23.167 --> 00:25.832
- They couldn't just conceive.
- Maybe they had to go to a clinic.

00:25.952 --> 00:27.944
Can you imagine Spock's Dad
in a little room

00:28.064 --> 00:30.599
with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears.

00:32.264 --> 00:34.829
How come on <i>Star Trek</i>
everybody's private parts are the same?

00:35.712 --> 00:39.533
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose."

00:42.511 --> 00:43.737
Hi. Can you help me?

00:43.857 --> 00:46.119
I was writing an e-mail
and the "A" key got stuck.

00:46.239 --> 00:47.960
Now it's just going "Aaa..."

00:49.087 --> 00:51.263
- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

00:52.351 --> 00:53.305
Diet Coke.

00:55.155 --> 00:56.202
And yogurt.

00:56.912 --> 00:58.269
And a little nail polish.

00:58.431 --> 00:59.896
I'll take a look at it.

01:00.326 --> 01:03.130
Gentlemen,
switching to local nerd news...

01:03.457 --> 01:06.157
Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team

01:06.277 --> 01:08.154
in the university Physics Bowl
this year.

01:08.314 --> 01:09.655
You're kidding. Why not?

01:09.816 --> 01:12.252
They formed a barbershop quartet
and got a gig

01:12.372 --> 01:14.145
playing Knott's Berry Farm.

01:15.795 --> 01:17.234
So, in your world,

01:17.777 --> 01:19.462
you're like the cool guys.

01:20.726 --> 01:21.885
Recognize.

01:24.122 --> 01:26.321
This is our year.
With those guys out,

01:26.441 --> 01:28.549
the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

01:29.203 --> 01:30.047
Zod?

01:30.254 --> 01:31.886
Kryptonian villain. Long story.

01:32.046 --> 01:33.087
Good story.

01:36.718 --> 01:38.976
- Count me out.
- What? Why?

01:39.345 --> 01:42.355
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

01:42.995 --> 01:45.388
Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

01:46.466 --> 01:48.896
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

01:49.858 --> 01:52.559
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

01:54.027 --> 01:57.040
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.288
By that reasoning we should also
play Bridge, hold up a chuppah

02:00.408 --> 02:02.838
and enter the Olympic
bobsled competition.

02:03.654 --> 02:05.253
Tickets to that, please.

02:06.331 --> 02:10.174
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

02:10.335 --> 02:11.468
No, don't.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.054
"The needs of the many...

02:14.214 --> 02:16.221
"... outweigh the needs of the few.

02:16.383 --> 02:17.445
"Or the one."

02:18.500 --> 02:19.937
Damn it, I'll do it.

02:21.622 --> 02:24.052
Episode 1x13

02:45.866 --> 02:47.629
First order of Physics Bowl business.

02:48.452 --> 02:51.841
{pos(192,220)}We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

02:52.207 --> 02:54.618
{pos(192,220)}How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

02:55.824 --> 02:59.683
{pos(192,220)}It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads-up for the ladies.

03:00.451 --> 03:01.309
The ladies?

03:01.470 --> 03:04.545
"Perpetual Motion Squad...
we can go all night."

03:05.473 --> 03:07.267
- I like it.
- I don't.

03:07.778 --> 03:10.264
{pos(192,210)}Teams are traditionally
named after fierce creatures,

03:10.384 --> 03:12.403
{pos(192,210)}thus intimidating one's opponent.

03:12.564 --> 03:15.274
{pos(192,210)}- Then we could be the Bengal tigers.
- Poor choice.

03:15.394 --> 03:17.444
Gram for gram,
no animal exceeds

03:17.564 --> 03:20.181
the relative fighting strength
of the army ant.

03:21.071 --> 03:22.062
{pos(192,210)}Maybe so,

03:22.182 --> 03:25.292
{pos(192,210)}but you can't incinerate a Bengal tiger
with a magnifying glass.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.867
Let's put it to a vote.
All those in favor...

03:30.987 --> 03:32.006
{pos(192,210)}Point of order.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.675
{pos(192,210)}I move that any vote on team names
must be unanimous.

03:34.795 --> 03:37.441
{pos(192,210)}No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger

03:37.561 --> 03:40.333
{pos(192,210)}when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

03:41.176 --> 03:44.337
{pos(192,210)}Will the gentleman from the great
State of Denial yield for a question?

03:45.160 --> 03:46.113
I will yield.

03:46.233 --> 03:49.116
{pos(192,210)}After we go through the exercise
of an annoying series of votes,

03:49.236 --> 03:52.267
{pos(192,210)}all of which the gentleman will lose,
does he then intend to threaten to quit

03:52.387 --> 03:54.219
{pos(192,210)}- if he does not get his way?
- He does.

03:54.339 --> 03:56.705
I move we are the Army Ants.
All those in favor?

03:58.840 --> 04:02.329
Good afternoon, and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

04:02.490 --> 04:04.178
{pos(192,200)}I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host

04:04.298 --> 04:06.515
{pos(192,200)}because apparently
I didn't have anything else to do

04:06.635 --> 04:09.906
on a Saturday afternoon,
and isn't that just a little sad?

04:11.956 --> 04:13.088
Gentlemen, ready?

04:13.249 --> 04:14.633
- Yes.
- Fire away.

04:14.753 --> 04:16.778
{pos(192,180)}It's none of my business,
but isn't a guy

04:16.898 --> 04:19.505
{pos(192,180)}who can't speak in front of women
gonna hold you back a little?

04:19.625 --> 04:22.197
{pos(192,210)}He'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

04:22.317 --> 04:25.577
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.271
Thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

04:28.658 --> 04:31.608
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

04:32.203 --> 04:35.053
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

04:35.173 --> 04:37.322
"What is the shortest
light pulse ever produced?"

04:38.274 --> 04:39.841
- Dr. Cooper.
- And of course,

04:39.961 --> 04:41.660
the answer is 130 attoseconds.

04:41.927 --> 04:43.870
- That is correct.
- I knew that, too.

04:44.688 --> 04:47.606
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question:

04:47.726 --> 04:49.520
"What is the quantum mechanical effect

04:49.640 --> 04:51.753
"used to encode data
on hard-disk drives?"

04:53.472 --> 04:55.923
And of course the answer is
giant magnetoresistance.

04:56.159 --> 04:57.941
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

04:58.394 --> 05:00.562
And I answered.
It's called teamwork.

05:02.549 --> 05:05.030
Don't you think I should answer
the engineering questions?

05:05.150 --> 05:06.338
I am an engineer.

05:06.642 --> 05:09.164
By that logic I should answer
all the anthropology questions

05:09.284 --> 05:10.715
because I'm a mammal.

05:13.660 --> 05:14.943
Just ask another one.

05:16.470 --> 05:18.668
"What artificial satellite
has seen glimpses

05:18.788 --> 05:20.740
of Einstein's predicted
frame dragging?"

05:21.784 --> 05:24.000
And of course,
it's Gravity Probe B.

05:24.599 --> 05:27.162
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

05:27.489 --> 05:28.198
Why?

05:28.451 --> 05:29.623
Because it's polite.

05:30.207 --> 05:32.225
What do manners
have to do with it?

05:32.385 --> 05:33.537
This is war.

05:34.485 --> 05:37.056
Were the Romans polite
when they salted the ground of Carthage

05:37.216 --> 05:39.208
to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

05:40.121 --> 05:42.772
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

05:44.882 --> 05:47.329
The objective of the competion
is to give correct answers.

05:47.489 --> 05:49.474
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

05:49.634 --> 05:52.107
Some of us might have
the correct answers, too.

05:52.357 --> 05:54.382
Oh, please.
You don't even have a PhD.

05:54.542 --> 05:56.777
- All right, that's it!
- Howard, sit down.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.180
- Maybe we should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

06:02.340 --> 06:05.485
All this button-pushing
is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.

06:06.988 --> 06:07.828
I agree.

06:08.191 --> 06:09.508
What did he say?

06:09.896 --> 06:11.212
He compared Sheldon

06:11.332 --> 06:14.451
to a disposable feminine
cleansing product

06:14.611 --> 06:16.709
one might use
on a summer's eve.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.074
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

06:25.684 --> 06:27.848
Leonard, excellent.
I want to show you something.

06:28.194 --> 06:29.865
Can it wait?
I need to talk to you.

06:30.054 --> 06:33.363
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.873
The colors are based
on <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>.

06:36.109 --> 06:39.427
The three of you will wear Support Red,
and I will wear Command Gold.

06:41.437 --> 06:42.731
Why do they say "AA"?

06:43.492 --> 06:44.490
Army Ants.

06:45.995 --> 06:49.654
Isn't that confusing? "AA" might mean
something else to certain people.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.820
Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

06:55.032 --> 06:56.194
No, I meant...

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
Never mind.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.420
Check it out,

07:01.023 --> 07:03.980
I got you a <i>Batman</i> cookie jar.

07:04.381 --> 07:07.123
Oh, neat!
What's the occasion?

07:07.341 --> 07:09.737
Well, you're a friend,
and you like <i>Batman</i>

07:09.897 --> 07:12.093
and cookies,
and you're off the team.

07:15.802 --> 07:16.711
What?

07:17.154 --> 07:19.306
Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.999
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did. I just came from there.

07:22.119 --> 07:24.200
Okay, I don't know
where you just came from,

07:24.360 --> 07:27.366
but it could'nt have been a team meeting
because I wasn't there.

07:27.532 --> 07:29.335
Ergo, the team did not meet.

07:30.204 --> 07:32.196
Okay, let me try it this way:

07:32.961 --> 07:35.857
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends,

07:36.017 --> 07:39.264
and one thing led to another,
and it turns out you're off the team.

07:40.533 --> 07:41.342
Why?

07:41.542 --> 07:43.625
Because you're taking
all the fun out of it.

07:44.028 --> 07:47.785
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics
Bowl the team that has the most fun?

07:48.014 --> 07:49.675
Okay, let me try it this way:

07:49.835 --> 07:53.048
You're annoying and no one
wants to play with you anymore.

07:55.341 --> 07:56.293
I see.

07:58.563 --> 08:00.725
At this point I should inform you

08:01.162 --> 08:03.402
that I intend to form my own team

08:03.562 --> 08:06.903
and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together

08:07.063 --> 08:10.044
and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.489
Thanks for the heads-up.

08:15.279 --> 08:16.248
You're welcome.

08:18.036 --> 08:19.419
- One more thing.
- Yes?

08:19.629 --> 08:20.858
It's on, bitch.

08:28.648 --> 08:31.464
{pos(192,220)}- So who'd he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

08:31.955 --> 08:34.982
{pos(192,220)}He just smiles and eats
macaroons out of his bat jar.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.020
{pos(192,220)}He's using psychological warfare.

08:38.466 --> 08:41.971
We must reply in kind.
I say we wait until he looks at us,

08:42.131 --> 08:45.669
then laugh like, "Yes, you are
a smart and strong competitor,

08:45.829 --> 08:47.618
"but we are also smart and strong,

08:47.778 --> 08:50.469
and we have a reasonable
chance of defeating you."

08:52.481 --> 08:54.237
How exactly would that laugh go?

08:59.531 --> 09:02.429
That sounds more like,
"We are a tall, thin woman

09:02.589 --> 09:05.128
who wants to make a
coat out of your Dalmatians."

09:07.670 --> 09:10.844
Let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

09:11.097 --> 09:11.897
So?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.674
So nothing.
Let's destroy him.

09:16.061 --> 09:17.061
Gentlemen.

09:25.334 --> 09:27.604
We're going to need
a strong fourth for our team.

09:28.070 --> 09:31.566
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played <i>TV's Blossom</i>.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.577
She got a PhD. in neuroscience
or something.

09:35.757 --> 09:39.584
Raj, we're not getting <i>TV's Blossom</i>
to join our Physics Bowl team.

09:41.758 --> 09:43.870
How about the girl
from <i>The Wonder Years</i> ?

09:45.618 --> 09:49.251
Gentlemen, I believe I've found
the solution to all our problems.

09:51.671 --> 09:53.367
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.344
Why? Because you slept together,
and when she was done with you

09:56.504 --> 09:58.992
she discarded you
like last night's chutney?

10:03.077 --> 10:03.937
Yes.

10:05.101 --> 10:07.157
Sometimes you've got
to take one for the team.

10:07.549 --> 10:08.876
Sack up, dude.

10:10.689 --> 10:11.493
Fine.

10:13.176 --> 10:15.547
Here I go, taking one for the team...

10:15.888 --> 10:16.991
in the sack.

10:20.225 --> 10:22.416
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

10:22.759 --> 10:24.960
So, Leslie,
I have a question for you,

10:25.122 --> 10:29.093
and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

10:29.471 --> 10:30.630
Hit that thing.

10:34.215 --> 10:36.429
Leonard, there's no reason
to feel uncomfortable

10:36.549 --> 10:38.471
just because we've seen
each other's faces

10:38.591 --> 10:41.645
and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

10:43.124 --> 10:44.115
There's not?

10:44.235 --> 10:46.807
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds
like there should be.

10:47.698 --> 10:50.314
Rest assured that any aspects
of our sexual relationship

10:50.434 --> 10:53.773
regarding your preferences,
your idiosyncrasies, your performance

10:53.893 --> 10:56.801
are still protected by the inherent
confidentiality of the bedroom.

10:56.921 --> 10:58.764
That's all very comforting,
but if it's okay,

10:58.884 --> 11:00.874
I'd like to get on
to my question now.

11:01.475 --> 11:02.283
Proceed.

11:02.718 --> 11:06.157
We are entering the Physics Bowl,
and we need a fourth for our team.

11:06.277 --> 11:09.798
No, thanks. I'm really busy with my
like-sign dilepton supersymmetry search.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.177
Dilepton, shmylepton.
We need you.

11:13.646 --> 11:14.506
Sorry.

11:15.777 --> 11:17.197
Well, we tried.

11:17.553 --> 11:21.102
We'll just have to face Sheldonmano
y mano y mano a mano.

11:22.013 --> 11:24.270
Wait, you're going up
against Sheldon Cooper?

11:25.473 --> 11:28.374
That arrogant, misogynistic,
East Texas doorknob

11:28.494 --> 11:31.189
that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles

11:31.309 --> 11:33.570
for laundry and childbearing?

11:36.607 --> 11:37.654
She's in.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.056
So, how do you feel?

11:42.490 --> 11:45.542
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

11:46.995 --> 11:48.168
Are you ready?

11:49.038 --> 11:51.672
Yeah. You know, you don't have
to stay for the whole thing.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.593
Oh, no. I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

12:01.544 --> 12:02.423
Gentlemen.

12:11.159 --> 12:12.747
I'm just gonna sit down.

12:16.691 --> 12:18.324
So, is that your team?

12:18.665 --> 12:20.227
Actually, I don't need a team.

12:20.347 --> 12:22.244
I could easily defeat you
single-handedly,

12:22.438 --> 12:24.204
but the rules require four.

12:24.365 --> 12:27.362
So, may I introduce
the third-floor janitor,

12:27.482 --> 12:30.360
the lady from the lunch room,
and my Spanish is not good...

12:30.480 --> 12:32.294
either her son or her butcher.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.911
And what about your team?

12:35.031 --> 12:37.977
What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

12:38.097 --> 12:39.191
Hello, Sheldon.

12:42.724 --> 12:43.767
Leslie Winkle.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.534
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question,

12:46.654 --> 12:49.355
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

12:51.137 --> 12:54.693
Well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

12:54.813 --> 12:57.588
So whatever verbal projectile
you launch in my direction

12:57.708 --> 13:00.311
is reflected off of me,
returns on its original trajectory

13:00.431 --> 13:01.656
and adheres to you.

13:02.774 --> 13:04.007
Oh, ouch!

13:05.281 --> 13:07.916
Okay, if everyone could
please take your seats.

13:15.852 --> 13:17.273
Here's your T-shirt.

13:20.873 --> 13:21.826
PMS?

13:22.499 --> 13:24.125
It's a couple days early...

13:26.295 --> 13:29.061
It stands for "Perpetual Motion Squad."

13:29.447 --> 13:31.119
Of course.
What was I thinking?

13:33.104 --> 13:34.562
Good afternoon, everyone,

13:34.682 --> 13:37.600
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl!

13:39.687 --> 13:43.158
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.954
AA versus...

13:47.115 --> 13:48.055
PMS.

13:48.616 --> 13:50.178
All night long, y'all!

13:55.239 --> 13:59.174
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question for ten points:

13:59.520 --> 14:02.288
"What is the iso-spin singlet partner

14:02.408 --> 14:04.054
"of the pi-zero meson?"

14:05.133 --> 14:05.932
PMS?

14:06.093 --> 14:07.631
- The eta meson.
- Correct.

14:10.306 --> 14:12.128
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

14:12.248 --> 14:14.816
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

14:15.351 --> 14:18.305
Denied.
All right, for ten points,

14:18.522 --> 14:20.875
"What is the lightest element on Earth

14:20.995 --> 14:22.741
"with no stable isotope?"

14:23.082 --> 14:23.887
AA?

14:24.007 --> 14:25.909
And of course,
the answer is technetium.

14:26.071 --> 14:26.869
Terrific.

14:28.156 --> 14:29.205
Next question:

14:29.366 --> 14:31.917
"What is the force between
two uncharged plates

14:32.037 --> 14:34.251
"due to quantum vacuum fluctuations?"

14:34.727 --> 14:35.544
PMS?

14:35.706 --> 14:38.189
Sheldon can suck on...
the Casimir effect.

14:38.309 --> 14:39.187
Correct.

14:44.461 --> 14:47.900
How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?

14:48.491 --> 14:49.309
PMS?

14:49.469 --> 14:51.183
- Shor's algorithm.
- Correct!

14:55.439 --> 14:58.317
4.1855 times ten
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.542
Prevost's theory of exchanges.

15:01.139 --> 15:03.226
Lambda equals one
over pi r squared n.

15:03.721 --> 15:05.407
760 degrees Celsius...

15:05.569 --> 15:08.431
the approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

15:09.656 --> 15:11.623
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

15:13.385 --> 15:14.525
A sigma particle.

15:14.923 --> 15:18.254
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

15:18.416 --> 15:19.214
Correct!

15:24.704 --> 15:28.597
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

15:29.634 --> 15:32.767
The score now stands.
AA: 1,150,

15:32.887 --> 15:36.022
PMS: 1,175.

15:36.183 --> 15:39.674
So, for 100 points and the match,

15:39.794 --> 15:43.744
please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

15:44.357 --> 15:46.074
Solve the equation.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.010
Holy crap.

15:51.032 --> 15:52.289
What the hell is that?

15:52.639 --> 15:56.125
Looks like something
they found on the ship at Roswell.

15:56.286 --> 15:58.420
Come on. Think.
Leslie?

15:58.581 --> 16:01.464
It's not gonna work if you rush me.
You have to let me get there.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.966
You are never gonna
let that go, are you?

16:04.128 --> 16:05.343
Ten seconds.

16:09.496 --> 16:10.390
PMS?

16:12.458 --> 16:13.785
Sorry, I panicked.

16:15.388 --> 16:16.604
Then guess.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.281
Eight.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.149
.4

16:27.567 --> 16:29.476
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

16:29.857 --> 16:30.661
AA,

16:31.375 --> 16:33.747
if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

16:36.852 --> 16:38.123
He doesn't have it.

16:38.739 --> 16:39.842
He's got squat.

16:49.354 --> 16:51.092
AA, I need your answer.

16:53.063 --> 16:55.896
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.853
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

16:58.015 --> 17:00.232
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.771
Winning Physics Bowl.

17:03.813 --> 17:05.771
How do you know anything
about physics?

17:05.891 --> 17:07.323
Here I am janitor.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.366
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

17:10.810 --> 17:12.660
Leningrad Politechnika.

17:13.151 --> 17:14.703
Go Polar Bears.

17:17.844 --> 17:19.482
That's a delightful little story,

17:19.602 --> 17:22.106
but our arrangement was that
you sit here and not say anything...

17:22.226 --> 17:25.179
- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

17:25.299 --> 17:28.320
Look, now, maybe you have
democracy now in your beloved Russia,

17:28.441 --> 17:31.301
but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

17:33.207 --> 17:35.154
AA, I need your official answer.

17:35.344 --> 17:37.434
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

17:37.647 --> 17:39.604
- I want a different question.
- You can't.

17:39.724 --> 17:41.147
- Formal protest.
- Denied.

17:41.308 --> 17:42.773
Informal protest.

17:43.522 --> 17:44.359
Denied.

17:45.311 --> 17:48.404
- I need your official answer.
- No. I decline to provide one.

17:48.566 --> 17:51.907
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

17:53.393 --> 17:54.963
That's your opinion.

17:57.945 --> 18:00.542
- The winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

18:02.008 --> 18:05.677
Is proving that you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important

18:05.797 --> 18:09.174
that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

18:10.859 --> 18:12.636
I don't understand the question.

18:14.098 --> 18:16.557
- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.

18:53.047 --> 18:54.798
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

18:55.715 --> 18:56.515
Who?

18:56.841 --> 18:58.897
My Physics Bowl trophy.

19:01.548 --> 19:04.814
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

19:04.974 --> 19:07.144
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

19:07.264 --> 19:09.568
My Physics Bowl trophy.

19:10.824 --> 19:12.322
Leonard is so smart.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.783
- Sheldon who?
- All right, that is very immature.

19:15.944 --> 19:18.373
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm not!

19:20.854 --> 19:23.285
- Okay, new contest.
- What are you doing?

19:23.584 --> 19:25.739
I am settling once and for all

19:25.859 --> 19:28.574
who is the smartest around here, okay?

19:28.694 --> 19:30.002
- Ready?
- Absolutely.

19:30.122 --> 19:31.174
Bring it on.

19:31.806 --> 19:34.423
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy
were the three daughters

19:34.543 --> 19:35.971
"in what TV family?"

19:40.450 --> 19:41.517
<i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

19:44.431 --> 19:48.275
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

19:53.174 --> 19:54.314
<i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

19:57.155 --> 19:58.118
<i>Van Halen.</i>

19:59.654 --> 20:02.289
"Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

20:04.635 --> 20:06.799
Oh, my God! Sean Penn!

20:06.995 --> 20:08.932
How do you know these things?

20:09.771 --> 20:12.631
I go outside,
and I talk to people.

20:14.494 --> 20:17.025
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record

20:17.145 --> 20:19.681
"for being named <i>People Magazine</i>'s
Sexiest Man Alive?"

20:20.140 --> 20:21.683
- William Shatner.
- Wait.

20:24.488 --> 20:26.077
I don't think it's Shatner.

20:26.432 --> 20:28.339
Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.

20:32.442 --> 20:33.694
Formal protest.

20:35.855 --> 20:38.116
"Singer who sang,
<i>Oops, I Did It Again</i> ?"

20:46.337 --> 20:49.085
"Tweetie Bird tought
he taw a what?"

20:53.159 --> 20:54.149
Romulan.

20:58.598 --> 20:59.532
Yes.

20:59.652 --> 21:01.887
He tought he taw a Romulan.
