- <i>Previously on</i> Good Witch...
- Shouldn't you be studying?

00:03.767 --> 00:05.770
- I already know everything.
- <i>I had such dreams</i>

00:05.804 --> 00:08.907
of leaving my mark
in so many different places.

00:08.939 --> 00:10.908
So you've made some
improvements on this guy, huh?

00:10.942 --> 00:13.011
- Sam's been good for me, too.
- Yeah, you told me you'd never

00:13.044 --> 00:15.547
- fall in love again.
- I probably did say that.

00:28.710 --> 00:30.680
Here you go! If you're
not feeling your best,

00:30.712 --> 00:32.348
you can come back here anytime.

00:35.450 --> 00:37.686
(door chimes)

00:41.441 --> 00:43.527
Can I help you find something?

00:45.995 --> 00:47.697
Oh, uh...

00:48.240 --> 00:49.741
Here.

00:50.813 --> 00:52.054
Take your pick.

00:53.978 --> 00:56.548
I found these paintbrushes in Italy.
They were being sold

00:56.581 --> 00:59.154
by an artist who barely
said a word to me.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.020
He just let his art do the talking.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.191
You can keep that one and just pay me

01:06.224 --> 01:08.226
if you think it inspires you to create.

01:09.261 --> 01:10.629
Thank you.

01:10.661 --> 01:12.097
Sure.

01:13.432 --> 01:15.897
Were you planning on setting up
your easel out front?

01:15.930 --> 01:17.869
- I was.
- Well, then I'm eager to see

01:17.902 --> 01:19.971
how your art comes alive.

01:23.924 --> 01:24.904
Hello.

01:24.937 --> 01:26.445
Mm-hmm...

01:28.912 --> 01:31.015
I thought you were
seeing patients all day.

01:31.048 --> 01:33.717
Well, that's sort of why I'm here.
I need some ginger candies

01:33.750 --> 01:36.587
for a woman I'm treating
with a digestion difficulty.

01:36.620 --> 01:39.723
Oh! Are you finally seeing the value
in some of my natural remedies?

01:39.756 --> 01:42.660
No, I'm sticking with science,
but she's allergic

01:42.694 --> 01:44.696
to the medication I prescribed
so I'm going with plan B.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.765
Here, let me show you where they are.

01:46.798 --> 01:48.319
That's not the only reason I came by.

01:48.353 --> 01:50.902
- Oh...
- (romantic melody)

01:54.140 --> 01:55.769
Oh, for heaven's sake.

01:55.802 --> 01:58.638
Alright, you two!
We get it, you're in love.

01:58.671 --> 02:01.007
A little restraint, please.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.315
Hello, Martha. Here.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.715
Help yourself to as many as you like.

02:06.748 --> 02:08.070
- Thank you.
- Hmm-hmm!

02:08.794 --> 02:10.863
Martha, thank you so much
for stopping by. I really wanted

02:10.896 --> 02:12.933
to talk to you about this
weekend's Tri-Cities Healthfest.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.934
Yes, and we're all
looking forward to it.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.470
Every year we just love
what you put together

02:17.504 --> 02:19.506
to showcase the best
this area has to offer

02:19.539 --> 02:22.342
for the mind, the body, and the spirit.

02:22.374 --> 02:24.410
But maybe this year we could have

02:24.444 --> 02:26.780
two minds working on the event,
instead of just one.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.048
Well, you've always been able
to handle it by yourself.

02:29.081 --> 02:31.083
Yeah, I just thought
that different perspectives

02:31.117 --> 02:33.153
might be useful.

02:33.185 --> 02:36.181
Oh! Who did you want working with you?

02:37.975 --> 02:40.460
- I haven't asked him yet.
- I wanted to get your approval.

02:40.492 --> 02:43.195
- Are you sure he has the time?
- The Healthfest takes

02:43.229 --> 02:47.300
- a lot of work.
- Well, maybe his schedule will open up.

02:47.332 --> 02:50.069
Then perhaps we should
make sure that it does,

02:50.103 --> 02:53.172
shall we, before we bring him on board.

02:53.206 --> 02:56.285
I'll let you make the announcement
once everything's a go.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.919
- What's in there?
- Ginger candies.

03:01.951 --> 03:04.951
- Ooh, that sounds delicious!
- I know.

03:08.751 --> 03:09.696
Want one?

03:09.730 --> 03:12.225
Oh, I couldn't possibly!
But since you insist...

03:12.258 --> 03:15.295
We can settle up later
when we talk with...

03:15.327 --> 03:17.600
you know who. Ta-ta!

03:18.900 --> 03:21.868
Here. Go get some more.

03:30.176 --> 03:33.313
- Hey!
- Oh!

03:33.345 --> 03:36.148
- Hi, Abigail.
- How was school?

03:36.182 --> 03:39.018
- Not so good.
- Mr. Decarlo announced

03:39.052 --> 03:41.488
the captain for the academic
decathlon team today.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.857
- And it wasn't you?
- He chose Larissa Diaz.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.160
- But it should have been you.
- I really thought

03:47.193 --> 03:50.330
I was going to be,
and I wanted it so much, but...

03:51.423 --> 03:52.758
Oh, well.

03:52.792 --> 03:54.500
You know, I've never been
the type who accepts

03:54.534 --> 03:56.570
what happens just because it happens.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.838
And you don't have to be either.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.173
But what am I supposed
to do about it now?

04:01.206 --> 04:04.176
There are always things
you can do to get what you want.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.347
I don't know.

04:07.379 --> 04:09.515
She got picked and I didn't.

04:09.548 --> 04:11.885
Shouldn't I just leave it that way?

04:11.917 --> 04:14.053
I'm just reminding you
there are always options,

04:14.087 --> 04:15.822
that's all.

04:32.214 --> 04:34.540
Well, you've put in some long hours.

04:34.966 --> 04:36.909
I guess so.

04:37.469 --> 04:38.910
How many more paintings
do you need to finish

04:38.943 --> 04:41.980
- before you leave town?
- How did you know?

04:42.013 --> 04:45.350
I can always tell when
an artist is under a deadline.

04:45.383 --> 04:48.086
I've got an exhibition
in St. Louis next week.

04:48.119 --> 04:50.154
With a lot of people there.

04:50.982 --> 04:52.224
I have a room

04:52.256 --> 04:54.768
that I could turn
into a studio at Grey House.

04:55.361 --> 04:58.965
A perfect place for an artist
who wants to observe life.

05:01.368 --> 05:04.069
Here's the address. I'll have
a room ready when you get there.

05:05.956 --> 05:07.205
Thanks.

05:11.406 --> 05:12.864
- Hey!
- Hello!

05:13.088 --> 05:15.314
Who's the artist?

05:18.009 --> 05:19.150
A guest at Grey House.

05:19.183 --> 05:21.587
Oh. I got a call from Martha saying

05:21.619 --> 05:23.969
she wants to meet with us
tomorrow. What's that about?

05:24.002 --> 05:26.658
Martha always has
the most interesting plans.

05:37.536 --> 05:41.474
(theme music)

05:43.456 --> 05:51.480
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:56.989 --> 06:00.491
I don't think we've ever had
an artist working here before.

06:00.525 --> 06:02.561
Is there going to be enough room?

06:02.594 --> 06:05.464
- Yeah, thanks.
- I brought you some breakfast.

06:05.496 --> 06:07.732
Ah, this place looks perfect!

06:07.765 --> 06:10.001
We want our guest to be
comfortable in case he wants

06:10.034 --> 06:13.005
- to produce a masterpiece.
- What are you going to work on?

06:13.037 --> 06:16.174
I'm not sure. I never really
know until it's finished.

06:16.207 --> 06:18.577
Well, I set you up right here
for a reason.

06:18.609 --> 06:21.513
Hopefully, you'll be inspired
by what you see.

06:23.481 --> 06:24.582
Oh, hello!

06:24.616 --> 06:27.219
I heard we had a painter staying here.

06:27.251 --> 06:30.188
- I'm Abigail.
- Harrison likes to, uh,

06:30.222 --> 06:31.961
introduce himself through his art.

06:32.821 --> 06:36.328
Oh. Then, I look forward
to seeing what you do.

06:37.923 --> 06:40.065
Maybe we should clear out

06:40.097 --> 06:42.767
and let our artist create.

06:42.801 --> 06:45.104
Might as well go outside
and enjoy our day.

06:45.137 --> 06:47.106
It is nice out there.

06:47.138 --> 06:49.737
Maybe I'll put out some things
for the guests to use,

06:49.770 --> 06:52.010
- if they want.
- That's a great idea.

07:02.179 --> 07:04.033
(Sam): <i>Who put this week's
schedule together?</i>

07:04.065 --> 07:06.392
- Jennifer Noreen, I think.
- Why am I so light on it?

07:06.424 --> 07:08.794
Maybe she wants you to have
a couple days off.

07:08.827 --> 07:12.164
- Huh. I'll have to thank her.
- (ringtone)

07:13.333 --> 07:14.298
Hey.

07:14.332 --> 07:17.479
Dr. Radford, I know you're at
the hospital all day...

07:17.512 --> 07:19.037
Is there a problem?

07:19.070 --> 07:21.506
Well, Arthur Brachvogel called

07:21.539 --> 07:24.275
and he was wondering
if he could see you today.

07:24.308 --> 07:27.712
- It sounds like he has the flu.
- Um, I could stop by his house

07:27.746 --> 07:30.183
when I leave the hospital.
Say six o'clock?

07:30.215 --> 07:32.450
- He lives on the edge of town.
- It's kind of out of your way...

07:32.484 --> 07:35.621
- Just tell him I'll be there.
- Right around six. Very good!

07:35.654 --> 07:37.389
Good. Thanks.

07:39.082 --> 07:40.207
Thanks for helping me

07:40.241 --> 07:42.094
get ready for next week's
competition, Grace.

07:42.126 --> 07:45.663
Well, I need to review my
constitutional amendments anyway.

07:45.696 --> 07:47.665
I hope they don't change it
again while we're studying.

07:47.698 --> 07:50.335
Yeah! You want to quiz me?

07:50.996 --> 07:52.372
Sure.

07:53.790 --> 07:56.341
I should pick through the hardest ones.

07:56.373 --> 07:58.777
I just feel like I really
need to know this stuff

07:58.810 --> 08:00.589
now that Mr. Decarlo made me captain.

08:01.590 --> 08:04.216
And hopefully nobody
on the team lets you down.

08:04.248 --> 08:06.585
(sigh) Hey, ladies!

08:06.618 --> 08:08.854
- Can you do me a favor?
- Probably.

08:08.887 --> 08:11.623
Can you taste these
and tell me what you think?

08:11.655 --> 08:14.502
Any favor that involves eating
is an easy favor to do.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.128
It's food for the Healthfest.

08:17.162 --> 08:18.437
I've done it six years in a row

08:18.470 --> 08:21.099
but I like to do something a
little extra special each year.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.402
- It's pretty good!
- Yeah!

08:23.435 --> 08:27.272
- It's low fat and low sodium.
- And it's still good.

08:27.304 --> 08:28.806
Good! Well, I'm gonna
make a whole bunch.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.142
Your mom hasn't asked me to be there yet

08:31.176 --> 08:33.578
but I'm just gonna be ready
when the call comes in.

08:33.611 --> 08:36.215
Yeah, you should definitely
make a lot of these.

08:36.248 --> 08:38.783
- Right after I have one more.
- Me too!

08:38.816 --> 08:41.719
- Help yourselves.
- Oh! My notes!

08:41.753 --> 08:44.657
- I'll grab a rag.
- These things are ruined.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.292
I'm going to have to redo
the whole stack!

08:47.326 --> 08:49.655
Look, you probably already
know everything on there anyway.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.507
But I'm the captain, Grace.

08:51.540 --> 08:53.700
I have to know things
better than anyone!

08:53.733 --> 08:56.703
Otherwise they might replace me
with someone else.

09:00.826 --> 09:02.409
Here...

09:09.675 --> 09:11.168
You've been feeling dizzy?

09:11.201 --> 09:14.320
- And tired all day.
- Huh. How's your appetite?

09:14.352 --> 09:17.156
I haven't really wanted to eat.
Not for a couple of days.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.659
Hmm. Well, it doesn't sound

09:19.692 --> 09:21.827
like the flu because your
temperature's not that high.

09:21.860 --> 09:24.496
But I can give you something
for the dizziness, if you want.

09:24.529 --> 09:26.838
And when do you think
I can get back to work?

09:27.565 --> 09:30.470
It's hard to say. Probably not
until the end of the week.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.117
- That long, huh?
- That's funny.

09:33.150 --> 09:35.350
Most people look for a chance
to say, "The doctor says

09:35.383 --> 09:37.676
I can't come in." I mean around here.

09:37.709 --> 09:40.301
I'm putting a plumbing line
in for a guest house out back

09:40.334 --> 09:41.748
and wanted to get the job done.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.751
This bug is putting me
a couple days behind schedule.

09:44.783 --> 09:47.519
You can get back to work
as soon as it all clears up.

09:48.238 --> 09:49.655
Thanks.

10:00.997 --> 10:02.711
Hey.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.337
Did you do all this today?

10:05.370 --> 10:07.657
I'm able to work fast when
there aren't any people around.

10:08.138 --> 10:09.676
It's really good.

10:13.312 --> 10:17.309
Hey, that's me... And that's George,

10:17.342 --> 10:19.318
carrying that stuff in the crate.

10:19.936 --> 10:21.420
Oh.

10:21.453 --> 10:23.956
I sometimes use the faces
of people I remember.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.592
I've never been in a painting before.

10:27.485 --> 10:30.488
I wonder if this is
what Mona Lisa felt like.

10:44.419 --> 10:45.945
What's all that?

10:45.977 --> 10:48.547
Just some things Cassie wanted
put outside, for the guests.

10:53.928 --> 10:56.421
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

10:57.474 --> 10:58.992
Good.

11:02.187 --> 11:03.629
It's just...

11:15.121 --> 11:16.156
Huh.

11:28.963 --> 11:30.623
So what did Martha want
to talk with us about?

11:30.656 --> 11:32.792
I'll let her make the official request.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.778
An official request?
I feel like I've been called

11:35.811 --> 11:38.331
- into the principal's office.
- Don't worry, you're not in trouble.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.700
Unless you've done something
I don't know about.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.466
There was a one day in senior year,

11:42.491 --> 11:44.173
when I skipped class to go to the
beach...

11:44.205 --> 11:45.937
Is that the worst thing
you did in high school?

11:45.970 --> 11:47.740
Just don't ask what I did at the beach.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.567
I can only imagine...

11:50.643 --> 11:53.745
- Oh, good! You're both here.
- Yes. And why?

11:53.778 --> 11:57.015
As you know, the Tri-Cities
Healthfest is this weekend.

11:57.048 --> 11:59.384
Well, sure. Cassie's organized
that thing for years.

11:59.417 --> 12:02.522
Except we thought that an extra dose

12:02.555 --> 12:04.857
of something special might
make it better than ever.

12:04.889 --> 12:07.460
- An extra dose of what?
- You.

12:08.837 --> 12:10.463
So, you want us to work together?

12:10.495 --> 12:13.007
Isn't that a wonderful idea?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.336
Yeah, I don't know if I have
time for something like that.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.071
The hospital has already given
you the time off you'll need.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.954
- Yeah? What a coincidence.
- Actually, that was

12:21.988 --> 12:25.010
- all Martha's doing.
- No one says no to the mayor.

12:25.043 --> 12:26.978
But there are still
all my other patients.

12:27.012 --> 12:30.483
Sam. I don't think you're
suddenly going to get hit

12:30.515 --> 12:32.818
with extra work that's going
to take time and energy away

12:32.851 --> 12:35.321
from something as important as this.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.255
- I guess I'm in.
- Wonderful! So, it's official.

12:41.148 --> 12:42.862
So that means we're co-workers?

12:42.894 --> 12:45.630
Yeah, I just hope
the two of us can get along.

12:45.663 --> 12:48.400
- Of course you can get along.
- I wouldn't even be considering

12:48.433 --> 12:50.602
this idea if I thought you were
going to mess things up.

12:52.287 --> 12:56.107
So... don't mess things up.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.810
Yes, Ma'am.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.616
Grace?

13:24.235 --> 13:27.305
Uh, sorry. I was looking for...

13:28.255 --> 13:30.709
- Grace.
- Yeah.

13:30.742 --> 13:34.313
- That's really good.
- Okay.

13:35.018 --> 13:36.351
What's that guy doing on the ladder?

13:36.966 --> 13:39.020
He's putting up a birdhouse.

13:39.053 --> 13:42.924
- He's gonna need a face.
- It's not finished yet.

13:45.928 --> 13:48.898
(ringtone)

13:49.437 --> 13:51.367
Hey, Courtney.

13:51.399 --> 13:53.232
I'm over at Grace's.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.903
You and I just saw each other.

13:58.439 --> 14:01.042
Fine, I miss you too.

14:01.616 --> 14:03.079
Okay.

14:03.660 --> 14:07.382
There she is. We'll be there
in a bit. Okay, bye.

14:09.040 --> 14:09.951
Hey.

14:09.985 --> 14:12.053
- You ready to go?
- Yeah,

14:12.087 --> 14:14.222
but we gotta go to Larissa's, first.

14:14.255 --> 14:17.058
I grabbed all of her study
materials by mistake

14:17.091 --> 14:19.227
and she needs time to go over everything

14:19.260 --> 14:22.397
- before she heads to her job.
- We can drop it off on the way.

14:22.431 --> 14:25.401
She's kind of freaking out
about everything.

14:25.433 --> 14:27.937
She already had to redo
all of her note cards,

14:27.970 --> 14:31.072
and then she lost the permission
slip for our next competition.

14:31.106 --> 14:33.442
It sounds like she's not
having a very good week.

14:35.223 --> 14:39.320
Yeah, there's been
a lot of stuff going on.

14:43.366 --> 14:44.786
(Cassie): Hey.

14:44.819 --> 14:46.788
- Hey, thanks for coming over!
- Sure!

14:46.822 --> 14:49.167
I printed out the names
of the new people I invited

14:49.200 --> 14:52.495
- to the Healthfest.
- You've already invited them?

14:52.528 --> 14:55.096
Well, yeah. I wanted
to get things moving.

14:55.130 --> 14:58.534
Oh! I thought we'd start by going
over who we want to be there.

14:58.567 --> 15:00.436
Oh, well we're kind of in a time crunch.

15:00.468 --> 15:03.271
No, I know. I just didn't
expect you to be so...

15:03.304 --> 15:07.008
- Efficient?
- Eager to make so many changes.

15:09.845 --> 15:12.447
Oh. What's this?

15:12.481 --> 15:15.016
Ah, I was just thinking about
where we could put everybody.

15:15.049 --> 15:16.986
That you've invited.

15:17.019 --> 15:19.421
There's room for your people, too.

15:19.453 --> 15:21.923
Well, the yoga instructors will need

15:21.957 --> 15:24.260
a lot more room than that,
and the massage therapists

15:24.293 --> 15:26.262
have to have room
to set up their tables.

15:26.294 --> 15:28.930
Well, as long as we have room
for the blood pressure monitors.

15:28.963 --> 15:31.966
And I invited a cardiologist to
check everybody's heart rates.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.068
Except you also need to keep in mind

15:34.101 --> 15:35.501
the flow of the room.

15:36.605 --> 15:39.475
I didn't realize the room had a flow.

15:39.508 --> 15:41.343
You'll get a sense of it
once you get there.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.246
Oh, here. I had a chance
to print up these flyers.

15:47.472 --> 15:50.318
Maybe you wanna give some
of those to your patients.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.054
- Okay, I will.
- What's this woman doing?

15:53.087 --> 15:55.558
- Yoga?
- Meditative aerobics.

15:55.591 --> 15:59.028
While the doctor just stands there.

15:59.061 --> 16:01.430
He's thinking about
very important doctor things.

16:01.462 --> 16:03.654
That's true!

16:16.544 --> 16:18.880
So, how long have you been
feeling this way?

16:18.913 --> 16:21.049
I was feeling sick
to my stomach for a few days

16:21.082 --> 16:23.084
last week, and then
I noticed how tired I was

16:23.117 --> 16:25.220
- over the weekend.
- But no fever?

16:25.254 --> 16:27.243
- No.
- Just general fatigue.

16:27.276 --> 16:30.024
Yeah. At first we thought
it might be food poisoning

16:30.058 --> 16:31.709
because my husband was
feeling the same way,

16:31.742 --> 16:34.529
but he hates doctors so he won't
be coming to see you.

16:34.562 --> 16:37.600
(chuckling): I'll try
not to take it personally.

16:37.633 --> 16:40.202
I can give you something for the nausea,

16:40.235 --> 16:42.204
but it sounds like you might
be dehydrated, so you should try

16:42.236 --> 16:44.539
to take some clear fluids until
you get your appetite back.

16:44.572 --> 16:46.875
- Got it.
- And if you're feeling better,

16:46.909 --> 16:48.643
you should come
to the Healthfest this weekend.

16:48.676 --> 16:51.312
Oh, I've seen posters for this
but I've never been.

16:51.346 --> 16:53.282
Yeah. I think
it's gonna be good this year.

16:53.314 --> 16:55.250
That woman's doing meditative yoga.

16:55.836 --> 16:59.621
And that's a doctor,
just standing there.

16:59.654 --> 17:01.838
Thanks.

17:12.056 --> 17:13.635
Tough time getting
out of bed this morning?

17:14.767 --> 17:16.906
- Yeah.
- How did you know?

17:16.939 --> 17:19.105
I could tell you were tired
when you walked in.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.279
But I have just the thing.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.084
Dried reishi mushrooms.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.438
You can eat them on their own,
or they make a really good soup.

17:31.472 --> 17:34.829
It'll boost your immune system
and get your energy back up.

17:35.456 --> 17:37.959
And there'll be a lot more food
that's good for you

17:37.992 --> 17:39.962
at this weekend's Healthfest.

17:39.994 --> 17:43.064
- Maybe I'll check it out.
- I hope to see you there.

17:48.092 --> 17:50.538
- Margo, aw!
- Cassie.

17:52.673 --> 17:56.077
I stopped by to see when I'll be
getting my invitation to display

17:56.110 --> 17:58.446
- my crystals at the Healthfest.
- And I was hoping to invite you

17:58.480 --> 18:01.016
again but I'm not sure there's
going to be room this year.

18:01.048 --> 18:05.119
So it's true. I'd heard there
was this newbie know-it-all

18:05.153 --> 18:06.775
who was taking over and was
pushing the rest of us out.

18:06.808 --> 18:08.730
You're not going to give in, are you?

18:08.763 --> 18:11.292
Well, that newbie and I
are working together.

18:11.326 --> 18:14.730
So then you should be able
to get him to do what you want.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.298
I sure he and I will be able to come up

18:17.331 --> 18:19.467
- with some sort of compromise.
- Good.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.502
I wouldn't want you to be
seduced by his ways.

18:21.536 --> 18:24.240
Well, I'll try to keep
my head on straight.

18:29.425 --> 18:31.313
Okay.

18:34.142 --> 18:37.018
We should definitely go to the bistro.

18:37.051 --> 18:40.121
- Oh, good! Young people.
- Can one of you give me a hand?

18:40.154 --> 18:43.557
- Oh, yeah. What do you need?
- I need someone to go up there

18:43.589 --> 18:45.954
and change a bulb. Cassie wanted
to brighten things up

18:45.988 --> 18:49.163
for the painter but my knee
doesn't do ladders very well.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.132
- Yeah, I can do it.
- Thanks.

18:51.165 --> 18:54.435
- I'll get you the right bulb.
- Hey.

18:54.469 --> 18:58.673
How are things going with
that smart-girl decathlon thing?

18:58.706 --> 19:00.785
Has there been any change
in your status?

19:00.819 --> 19:04.513
No. But I've been trying
to help Larissa not stress out

19:04.546 --> 19:07.583
over all the weird things that
have been going on with her.

19:07.615 --> 19:09.340
Weird things?

19:10.085 --> 19:12.520
Have you been working
on getting rid of your nemesis?

19:13.469 --> 19:15.724
Abigail, I would never do that!

19:17.014 --> 19:19.795
At least, I don't think I would.

19:19.827 --> 19:22.697
- This one should work.
- Alright, you go up there

19:22.731 --> 19:26.067
and hold the bulb and the rest
of us will turn the ladder.

19:29.008 --> 19:31.807
That's an old joke. Actually,

19:31.839 --> 19:34.076
Some buddies and I tried it
once. Didn't work very well.

19:34.108 --> 19:37.112
- Up you go.
- Okay.

19:38.712 --> 19:41.584
- Whoa!
- Oh! Let me get that.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.446
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

19:47.626 --> 19:49.391
Have you guys seen this?

19:50.172 --> 19:52.693
Is that the one
he was working on outside?

19:52.727 --> 19:57.166
I don't know, but... look.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.439
Wow.

20:05.688 --> 20:07.608
Is that me in the painting?

20:07.642 --> 20:10.078
And me in there with you?

20:10.112 --> 20:11.555
His last painting had stuff in it

20:11.588 --> 20:15.418
- that hadn't happened yet, too.
- Okay, this is freaky.

20:17.586 --> 20:19.910
I agree with my granddaughter.

20:20.355 --> 20:22.458
This is freaky.

20:37.172 --> 20:39.341
(door chimes)

20:39.374 --> 20:42.266
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.681
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:45.713 --> 20:48.243
It's just, um... I was wondering

20:48.277 --> 20:51.153
if you might have anything
like a study-notes organizer.

20:51.776 --> 20:54.122
It's for Larissa. She's been having

20:54.155 --> 20:56.858
weird things happen to her
ever since she was named captain

20:56.892 --> 20:59.502
and I just want her to know
that I support her and want her

20:59.535 --> 21:01.843
- to succeed.
- Glad to know that you're not

21:01.875 --> 21:04.288
jealous because Larissa
got something you wanted.

21:04.766 --> 21:08.031
I mean, even if I was jealous,
which I'm not,

21:08.064 --> 21:10.172
what could I do? She was chosen over me

21:10.204 --> 21:12.171
and that's the end of it.

21:12.239 --> 21:13.858
That's a good thing to remember.

21:13.883 --> 21:17.321
- Yeah.
- Umm...

21:19.220 --> 21:20.985
Well, would this work?

21:21.017 --> 21:23.442
- Uh, yeah.
- It's perfect.

21:23.476 --> 21:26.060
Okay. Here you go.

21:26.506 --> 21:27.395
Thanks.

21:30.232 --> 21:31.653
(door chimes)

21:37.947 --> 21:41.068
- Hey, Monica.
- Hi!

21:41.093 --> 21:43.062
This is what you got last time.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.063
You're absolutely right.

21:46.095 --> 21:48.339
- Did it help you relax?
- It did.

21:48.372 --> 21:50.006
But just this week

21:50.039 --> 21:52.814
I started having headaches
right after my morning walk,

21:52.846 --> 21:56.918
so I thought something like this
might help take the pain away.

21:56.952 --> 22:00.125
It will. Just light the candle
and think about the flames,

22:00.157 --> 22:02.545
and imagine yourself pain-free

22:02.577 --> 22:04.636
while the aroma stimulates
your endorphins.

22:04.670 --> 22:05.891
Thanks!

22:11.566 --> 22:15.317
- Is everything okay?
- I thought I brought my wallet.

22:15.670 --> 22:18.045
I've been forgetting everything
this week.

22:18.077 --> 22:21.751
- You can just pay me next time.
- Or better yet,

22:22.319 --> 22:25.381
why not come to the Healthfest
and we can settle up there?

22:28.016 --> 22:31.000
Maybe you'll meet some
of my other customers there.

22:31.786 --> 22:35.169
- I just might do that.
- Thanks for this.

22:35.194 --> 22:36.839
I hope it does the trick.

22:41.048 --> 22:43.059
(Sam): You can put that
right there, please,

22:43.093 --> 22:45.580
and I'll put the respiratory
specialist right here,

22:45.613 --> 22:48.556
across from the booth
on muscular degeneration.

22:48.589 --> 22:51.091
Hey. I didn't know you were

22:51.124 --> 22:52.345
going to start setting up already.

22:52.377 --> 22:54.505
Oh, I was just putting cards
on all the tables marking off

22:54.537 --> 22:56.649
- who goes where.
- Oh! Well, these are...

22:56.683 --> 22:59.300
all medical. People from the hospital.

22:59.334 --> 23:03.004
Are they? Oh, I guess
I just went with what I know.

23:03.037 --> 23:05.841
Then that would put
everyone I know at the end.

23:05.874 --> 23:08.844
Oh, well, we can mix and match.

23:08.876 --> 23:11.445
Can I at least put
your aromatherapy friend

23:11.479 --> 23:13.971
a few booths away from
the "dangers of smoking"?

23:14.005 --> 23:16.879
- So people don't get confused.
- Fine.

23:18.255 --> 23:20.288
- Hey!
- Stephanie.

23:20.320 --> 23:24.711
Just thought I'd stop by
and see where my booth might be.

23:24.744 --> 23:27.461
But I've looking all around
and I can't seem to find mine.

23:27.494 --> 23:30.298
- Oh! I'm sure it's somewhere.
- I saw it on Sam's list.

23:30.330 --> 23:32.600
- Is it?
- Oh, yeah,

23:32.634 --> 23:35.380
I may not have made a card for that one.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.873
Wait. So you might not
have room for me at all?

23:37.905 --> 23:39.068
No, I'm sure we'll find something.

23:39.102 --> 23:41.028
Yeah! Somewhere.

23:43.781 --> 23:45.881
Oh! There you are!

23:45.913 --> 23:47.214
I just thought I'd come and see

23:47.248 --> 23:50.352
my two favorite event planners
in action.

23:50.384 --> 23:52.953
It looks like things are being
set up differently this year.

23:52.987 --> 23:56.458
- Yeah, they moved me.
- For some variety!

23:56.490 --> 23:59.000
Oh, I like it! That way,
everyone in the tri cities

23:59.033 --> 24:01.462
can get the full taste
of what we have to offer.

24:01.496 --> 24:03.465
If they can even find me.

24:03.498 --> 24:05.403
- They'll find you.
- Don't worry.

24:05.436 --> 24:08.169
Oh, wonderful!

24:08.201 --> 24:10.923
You know, they say that some
couples can't work together

24:10.944 --> 24:13.080
but I knew it'd be different
with you two.

24:13.114 --> 24:15.249
You don't seem to be having
any trouble at all!

24:35.769 --> 24:38.172
- Good morning.
- What are you working on?

24:38.919 --> 24:40.975
I'm still figuring it out.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.746
After seeing your other
paintings, I can't wait

24:43.778 --> 24:46.313
to find out what's going
to be happening in this one.

24:48.470 --> 24:49.951
Am I in it?

24:50.347 --> 24:51.919
Maybe.

24:52.349 --> 24:54.155
What am I going to be doing?

24:57.479 --> 24:59.361
I'll let you see when I'm done.

25:01.609 --> 25:02.998
I guess I can wait till then.

25:04.612 --> 25:05.399
But everyone who lives here

25:05.432 --> 25:08.970
is very curious to see what's
gonna come out of that brush.

25:24.152 --> 25:27.922
In what year was the most recent
amendment to the constitution ratified?

25:27.955 --> 25:29.990
- 1992.
- Good.

25:30.024 --> 25:32.294
- And when was it first proposed?
- 1789.

25:32.326 --> 25:35.329
That's right! Larissa.

25:36.185 --> 25:38.900
We started practicing 20 minutes ago.

25:38.932 --> 25:41.135
Yeah, um... sorry.

25:41.169 --> 25:43.271
It's the second time
you've been late this week.

25:43.567 --> 25:47.109
- I fell asleep in the quad.
- Okay.

25:47.142 --> 25:49.978
Well, we were just going over
constitutional amendments.

25:50.010 --> 25:51.992
The most recent one ratified?

25:53.047 --> 25:55.579
Is that about voting age?

25:57.331 --> 25:58.319
Um...

25:58.353 --> 26:01.189
Congressional salaries.

26:02.215 --> 26:03.587
Right.

26:04.092 --> 26:06.928
Larissa, I need all team members

26:06.961 --> 26:10.265
performing at their best
and if you can't do it, I...

26:14.056 --> 26:15.470
Grace...

26:20.396 --> 26:22.410
I think you should
take her place as captain.

26:23.732 --> 26:25.879
Except you already picked Larissa.

26:25.911 --> 26:28.816
I know, but... I think
we need to make a change.

26:28.849 --> 26:31.218
Maybe she just needs some rest...

26:31.251 --> 26:33.045
And if we had the time,
she could take it.

26:33.078 --> 26:35.990
But the competition is next week, so...

26:37.371 --> 26:38.527
Larissa, are you okay?

26:38.559 --> 26:40.666
I don't know.

26:41.542 --> 26:43.532
I think somebody should call a doctor.

26:44.420 --> 26:47.169
- Okay. Just have a seat.
- Have a seat.

26:47.201 --> 26:50.050
You'll be okay.
Don't worry, don't worry.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.341
(Sam): Your daughter's going to be fine,

26:53.374 --> 26:56.484
but she does need a lot of rest.
I'd keep her home from school

26:56.516 --> 26:58.846
for a couple days. After that,
I think you'll be all right.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.449
Great. Thank you so much.

27:03.772 --> 27:05.086
- Uh, hey!
- Hi.

27:05.118 --> 27:07.121
I brought by a couple
of invoices that we both need

27:07.154 --> 27:09.523
- to sign before the weekend.
- Well, let me take a look.

27:09.557 --> 27:11.526
Yeah, um...

27:11.558 --> 27:14.261
was that Grace's friend,
Larissa, and her mom?

27:14.295 --> 27:17.332
Yeah. She had a dizzy spell at school

27:17.364 --> 27:20.035
and her teacher said
she kept forgetting things.

27:20.581 --> 27:22.136
Tired and forgetful?

27:22.170 --> 27:24.306
I've had customers complaining
about the same thing.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.169
- You, too?
- Yeah.

27:26.203 --> 27:28.576
Larissa was my fourth patient to
come in with the same symptoms:

27:28.609 --> 27:31.045
Lethargy, headache, nausea,
and decreased memory.

27:31.078 --> 27:33.114
- When did it start?
- About a week ago.

27:33.146 --> 27:35.249
- Same as mine.
- I ran a culture

27:35.282 --> 27:37.251
to see if it was a virus,
but it came back negative.

27:37.285 --> 27:38.720
What do you think is causing it?

27:38.752 --> 27:42.110
I don't know. Can you get
in touch with your customers

27:42.142 --> 27:44.368
- and get them back in the shop?
- Yeah, I can try.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.692
Eve, can you set times for
these patients to come back in?

27:46.725 --> 27:49.445
- Yes, Doctor.
- Do you think everybody's sick

27:49.470 --> 27:51.670
- because of the same thing?
- I think they might be.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.336
And you and I are
going to figure out why.

28:04.605 --> 28:05.673
(Sam): Thanks for coming in.

28:05.707 --> 28:07.976
I've been going back over
your chart and communicating

28:08.008 --> 28:11.555
with some other patients and
there are some commonalities

28:11.587 --> 28:14.448
- we think might be connected.
- Connected in what way?

28:14.482 --> 28:17.886
It does seem odd that we were
all thrown off our feet

28:17.919 --> 28:20.755
- in pretty much the same way.
- Right around the same time.

28:20.787 --> 28:23.592
- About a week ago, yeah.
- Did you make

28:23.624 --> 28:25.559
any dietary changes,
or alter your sleep pattern?

28:25.593 --> 28:28.349
- Nothing's different, no.
- <i>I've been eating</i>

28:28.382 --> 28:30.798
that mushroom soup you told me
to do, but before that,

28:30.832 --> 28:34.870
- meat and potatoes, mostly.
- So it's not food related.

28:34.902 --> 28:36.872
We hardly eat dinner
with Larissa at all.

28:36.904 --> 28:39.173
She's got a baby-sitting job
most nights,

28:39.207 --> 28:41.410
so she usually eats on the way.

28:41.435 --> 28:43.785
And does she have any history
of cognitive failure?

28:43.817 --> 28:46.884
No. She usually remembers everything.

28:48.121 --> 28:49.286
<i>You know how much</i>

28:49.320 --> 28:51.186
- I like to walk.
- Every morning.

28:51.218 --> 28:54.123
And until last week
I was zipping right along.

28:54.155 --> 28:57.721
Whatever this is
slowed me down completely.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.728
<i>Oh, how about that prescription?</i>

28:59.760 --> 29:02.596
- Did it take care of your dizziness?
- Better, yeah.

29:02.630 --> 29:04.053
Spent a little bit of time working on

29:04.085 --> 29:07.201
that new plumbing line.
But I got tired so quickly.

29:07.938 --> 29:10.262
I just hope this isn't going
to end up with me having to see

29:10.296 --> 29:12.974
a doctor. I just like what you
prescribe a whole lot better.

29:13.007 --> 29:15.776
Not all of them are as bad
as you think they are.

29:15.810 --> 29:17.712
We'll get to the bottom of this.

29:17.745 --> 29:20.450
Once we figure out
how everything connects.

29:25.914 --> 29:27.833
(sigh)

29:35.697 --> 29:39.301
Hey! I heard you got made captain.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.670
- How'd you know that?
- Your mom told me.

29:41.702 --> 29:43.671
But I figured it would happen eventually

29:43.705 --> 29:45.840
- because you wanted it so badly.
- Except I didn't want it

29:45.872 --> 29:48.656
- to happen like this.
- All that matters is that it did.

29:48.690 --> 29:51.539
- So good job.
- Oh, no, no.

29:51.571 --> 29:53.847
I didn't do anything to cause it.

29:55.406 --> 29:57.319
At least, I don't think I did.

29:57.352 --> 30:00.555
You never know. You might be
more powerful than you thought.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.750
There's got to be something
these people have in common.

30:09.983 --> 30:12.333
Yeah, I thought you and I'd
be able to figure it out.

30:12.366 --> 30:15.035
Are your customers going through, like,

30:15.068 --> 30:17.351
any emotional or existential crisis?

30:17.352 --> 30:19.322
You want to know about
their spiritual well-being?

30:19.354 --> 30:23.491
- I'm looking for anything.
- No, they all seemed okay.

30:23.524 --> 30:26.475
What about your patients?
Maybe they stopped taking their meds?

30:26.507 --> 30:28.496
Sounds like something
a doctor would ask.

30:28.530 --> 30:30.833
Well, I do hang out with one
every now and then.

30:31.730 --> 30:34.669
What is the common thread?

30:34.703 --> 30:36.672
If they lived in the same
neighborhood at least that would

30:36.705 --> 30:39.342
- give us something to look at...
- They live all over.

30:40.739 --> 30:41.946
Well, we'd better

30:41.978 --> 30:44.713
get this map figured out
before the Healthfest gets here.

30:45.661 --> 30:48.851
So I moved things around
to make room for your friends.

30:48.883 --> 30:50.986
And I figured out a way

30:51.019 --> 30:54.002
to get all your hospital people
where you wanted them.

30:56.171 --> 30:58.761
Well, look at that.

30:58.794 --> 31:01.593
It's nice to see when things
finally come together.

31:10.978 --> 31:12.607
Still working?

31:12.640 --> 31:15.777
Yeah. I just want to finish
this last painting before I go.

31:15.811 --> 31:18.047
- Can I see how it looks?
- You can see

31:18.080 --> 31:20.049
with everybody else, when I'm done.

31:20.904 --> 31:23.451
Have you enjoyed your time
here at Grey House?

31:23.699 --> 31:26.289
- I've started to, yeah.
- I mean, at first I didn't like

31:26.322 --> 31:28.056
that you set me up here,
in what seems to be

31:28.090 --> 31:29.871
the busiest room in the house.

31:30.488 --> 31:33.295
I thought you might like
to see some familiar faces.

31:33.329 --> 31:36.065
Faces, I don't mind.
It's the people that are the problem.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.834
They're just so unpredictable.

31:38.867 --> 31:41.937
- I don't understand them at all.
- From what I've seen

31:41.969 --> 31:45.073
you understand them better
than anyone I know.

31:45.345 --> 31:47.097
All I do is paint.

31:47.409 --> 31:50.880
Well, you painted Sam and me together

31:50.912 --> 31:54.092
- before you even knew we were.
- He looked at you a certain way

31:54.125 --> 31:56.818
when he came into your shop.
I could tell you were together.

31:56.851 --> 31:58.853
And you predicted what
George and Nick and the others

31:58.887 --> 32:00.856
were gonna do before they even did it.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.626
I heard some certain things get said.

32:03.659 --> 32:06.395
It was clear what was
going to happen after that.

32:07.034 --> 32:08.898
Well, I'll let you get back
to your painting.

32:09.745 --> 32:12.735
So we can all find out what's
going to happen after that.

32:32.121 --> 32:34.090
Oh my!

32:34.122 --> 32:37.624
Well, this is quite the event
you put together.

32:37.658 --> 32:41.364
Bringing on someone with Sam's
perspective was a good idea.

32:41.397 --> 32:43.631
I'm just glad he agreed
to the partnership.

32:43.665 --> 32:46.736
When I found out who I'd be
working with, how could I say no?

32:46.768 --> 32:48.803
Perhaps you two should consider planning

32:48.836 --> 32:51.072
a different kind
of special event someday.

32:51.105 --> 32:53.842
You know, for some special occasion...

32:53.876 --> 32:56.712
- This one was fine, for now.
- Yeah, there's no rush.

32:56.745 --> 33:00.483
I'm just saying this was
good practice, that's all.

33:00.515 --> 33:03.017
(laughing) Stephanie!

33:03.051 --> 33:06.688
Ah! Thank you for giving me
my old spot back.

33:06.722 --> 33:09.592
Oh, yeah. We decided we didn't
need to make too many changes.

33:10.735 --> 33:12.160
Can I bring you over a plate?

33:12.194 --> 33:14.362
- It's really healthy, right?
- It is.

33:14.394 --> 33:16.498
Well, then, I can eat
twice as much, bring two.

33:16.532 --> 33:19.397
- Ha, ha! Okay.
- Thanks.

33:24.361 --> 33:26.642
Monica. You made it!

33:26.675 --> 33:29.145
Yeah, I managed to walk
all the way here.

33:29.178 --> 33:32.614
Getting in tune with nature
really seemed to perk me up.

33:32.648 --> 33:36.081
Great. Margo, nice to see you.

33:42.170 --> 33:43.893
Dr. Radford.

33:44.548 --> 33:45.928
Arthur.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.697
- You're looking better.
- Yeah, it feels good

33:48.729 --> 33:50.932
to get out of the house
and get some fresh air.

33:50.966 --> 33:54.503
Yeah, well, low-impact aerobic activity
really increases that lung capacity.

33:54.535 --> 33:56.471
In fact, there's a whole exhibit
on it right here.

33:56.505 --> 33:59.050
Or, check out the meditation
display over there,

33:59.082 --> 34:01.190
which is another great way
to regulate breathing.

34:01.222 --> 34:04.442
- Maybe I'll do them both.
- See ya.

34:07.082 --> 34:09.184
- Dr. Radford.
- Oh, hi Carol.

34:09.217 --> 34:11.520
- And how are you feeling today?
- Better.

34:11.552 --> 34:14.297
We're both feeling better.
Maybe it was just

34:14.331 --> 34:16.204
getting back into our own house.

34:16.958 --> 34:20.686
- Hey there, Arthur.
- Carol.

34:20.719 --> 34:24.132
- I see your mom got home okay.
- Yep, back in her own bed.

34:24.743 --> 34:26.583
What, you two know each other?

34:26.614 --> 34:29.070
Arthur's sort of our neighbor.

34:29.103 --> 34:31.706
Oh? I thought you live
on the other side of town.

34:31.739 --> 34:34.810
We were house-sitting for my
mom who lives next door to him.

34:35.228 --> 34:37.513
Do you have a walking path
behind your house?

34:37.545 --> 34:39.648
Yeah. I see the same people
back there all the time.

34:40.728 --> 34:43.117
I think, maybe, one of my
customers walks back there.

34:43.150 --> 34:46.978
If everyone else has been
staying at the same place...

34:47.011 --> 34:48.877
That gives us a proximal cause.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.192
Arthur, did you get a permit

34:51.226 --> 34:53.195
to dig that new plumbing line
you're putting in?

34:53.226 --> 34:55.996
Why would I need permission
to dig in my own backyard?

34:56.453 --> 34:58.700
Because you never know what
you'll tap into down there.

34:58.733 --> 35:00.702
And if he hit a pocket of gas...

35:00.735 --> 35:02.542
That would explain everything.

35:11.201 --> 35:12.615
Well, there's no way
you could have known

35:12.648 --> 35:14.550
that you hit a pocket of methane gas.

35:15.055 --> 35:17.720
But it causes the kinds
of headaches and dizziness

35:17.753 --> 35:19.722
and loss of memory
that people were experiencing.

35:20.769 --> 35:22.291
I guess I really messed up.

35:22.323 --> 35:25.193
- Is it okay to even be here?
- Just to play it safe,

35:25.227 --> 35:27.263
they're recommending that
everyone in the neighbourhood

35:27.296 --> 35:29.631
find alternate housing for one night.

35:38.714 --> 35:40.150
Dr. Radford?

35:40.183 --> 35:42.919
- Ms. Diaz!
- What's going on?

35:42.951 --> 35:45.287
We figured out why
everyone was feeling sick.

35:45.321 --> 35:48.634
There was an underground patch
of methane that was exposed.

35:49.074 --> 35:52.562
- Oh? Is that serious?
- It can be, but this was

35:52.594 --> 35:55.517
was a very small amount,
so there's no long-term danger.

35:55.550 --> 35:57.070
What are you doing here?

35:57.103 --> 36:00.116
Larissa has her
baby-sitting job right here.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.540
Which is why she was affected too.

36:04.573 --> 36:07.809
I was just filling in for her
until she feels better.

36:07.843 --> 36:10.836
And she'll be fine. Too, in another day.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.553
But we should let the others know.

36:12.585 --> 36:15.949
- Good idea.
- Excuse us.

36:17.742 --> 36:20.223
Monica. Hi, it's Cassie Nightingale.

36:24.794 --> 36:26.895
(Larissa): Is this why
I was feeling so tired?

36:26.928 --> 36:28.915
And why I forgot so many things?

36:28.949 --> 36:30.967
Forgetfulness and sluggishness

36:31.000 --> 36:34.204
- were part of the same thing.
- But the effect is short-term.

36:34.236 --> 36:36.939
They're testing the air to
make sure they stopped the leak,

36:36.973 --> 36:39.791
but within a day or so it should
be safe to get back there.

36:40.324 --> 36:43.978
- I'm so sorry, to all of you.
- It's okay.

36:44.519 --> 36:45.982
There's no way you could have known.

36:47.397 --> 36:48.658
You should all increase

36:48.690 --> 36:50.319
your respiratory activity
for a couple of days.

36:50.352 --> 36:52.354
Get some air circulating in your lungs.

36:52.388 --> 36:54.357
And try to get lots of fresh
air and drink plenty of water.

36:54.390 --> 36:56.491
Yes, stay hydrated and start getting

36:56.524 --> 36:58.660
some variety back in your diets.

36:58.694 --> 37:00.763
Yeah, just sit down and enjoy
some meals with friends.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.435
- Well, thanks to both of you.
- Thank you so much.

37:05.468 --> 37:07.837
Yeah, it's a good thing you
both ended up at that Healthfest

37:07.870 --> 37:10.839
- to compare notes.
- It was Cassie's idea

37:10.872 --> 37:13.442
that we team up on it
in the first place.

37:15.877 --> 37:17.913
Otherwise, we might have
never figured this out.

37:18.595 --> 37:19.848
I just thought it'd be good idea

37:19.881 --> 37:21.783
to combine our different perspectives.

37:21.817 --> 37:25.255
It's a good thing we did.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.529
- So Larissa's going to be okay?
- Yes, she is.

37:34.562 --> 37:36.531
Just a few days of fresh air

37:36.564 --> 37:39.001
and she'll be to full
academic decathlon strength.

37:39.035 --> 37:41.303
Which means she'll be captain again.

37:41.337 --> 37:44.007
- If Mr. Decarlo lets her.
- I already talked to him.

37:44.040 --> 37:46.676
- He said that he will.
- Oh! That's really nice of you.

37:46.709 --> 37:49.645
I'm just glad I wasn't
the reason Larissa got sick.

37:49.678 --> 37:52.137
And nothing else that happened
was because of you either.

37:53.964 --> 37:55.645
How can you be so sure of that?

37:56.549 --> 37:59.354
Because sometimes notes get ruined

37:59.388 --> 38:02.792
and permission slips get lost
and things just happen.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.986
That's good to remember.

38:06.838 --> 38:08.048
I'm so glad to hear

38:08.081 --> 38:09.598
you were concerned
that none of it was your fault.

38:09.631 --> 38:11.967
It just shows how compassionate you are.

38:12.482 --> 38:14.288
You don't want something bad
to happen to someone else even

38:14.322 --> 38:16.639
- if it meant good things for you.
- No, never.

38:16.672 --> 38:19.914
And whether you're the captain
or not, I will be there,

38:19.947 --> 38:22.779
- cheering you on.
- Oh, um, hey,

38:22.812 --> 38:25.179
just don't cheer too loud.
You can be kind of embarrassing.

38:25.212 --> 38:28.540
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll cheer even louder.

38:33.122 --> 38:36.859
- There we go.
- Everything back in its place.

38:36.892 --> 38:39.861
Did you get enough artwork
together for your exhibition?

38:39.895 --> 38:43.543
I did. For as many people
as want to come there and see.

38:43.576 --> 38:45.714
I'm sure they'll be very impressed.

38:45.748 --> 38:47.437
I don't think I ever paid you
for the paintbrush.

38:47.469 --> 38:50.506
- You can keep it.
- I don't need it anymore.

38:50.538 --> 38:53.910
I was using my paintings
to do all the talking for me

38:53.942 --> 38:55.911
but it turns out that there's a
whole other way to communicate.

38:55.944 --> 38:58.780
I learned that by watching
everyone in this room.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.783
Then I hope this is the beginning

39:00.815 --> 39:02.951
of some wonderful conversations.

39:03.616 --> 39:05.289
It was really nice meeting all of you.

39:06.009 --> 39:08.056
I actually enjoyed being with you.

39:08.089 --> 39:10.622
- Thank you.
- Take care.

39:10.656 --> 39:13.376
And let us know if we end up
in any more of your paintings.

39:14.224 --> 39:16.226
- I can help you with these.
- Oh, thanks.

39:22.939 --> 39:25.613
- Oh, hello!
- Hi. Oh, there's everybody.

39:25.646 --> 39:27.609
We were just
saying goodbye to the artist.

39:27.643 --> 39:30.387
Hmm. Hey, I got an e-mail
from a friend of yours.

39:30.419 --> 39:32.614
At least I assume he was
a friend of yours

39:32.647 --> 39:34.616
because his name is Swami Floyd.

39:34.649 --> 39:38.488
- He's one of my best customers.
- He loved being

39:38.520 --> 39:41.375
at the Healthfest and he hopes
we'll invite him back next year.

39:41.407 --> 39:44.694
Oh, so we're already
planning on doing it again?

39:44.727 --> 39:48.531
Well, nobody can predict the
future but if I have time, I...

39:50.371 --> 39:51.567
might be willing to pair up.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.571
I could maybe see us doing that, sure.

39:56.004 --> 39:58.677
- Oh, hey, Sam!
- Hey, George. What's that?

39:58.709 --> 40:01.676
Oh, our guest wanted
to leave us all a gift.

40:01.710 --> 40:03.746
It's a painting he did
while he was here.

40:03.779 --> 40:05.915
That could mean something.

40:05.948 --> 40:09.018
Well, let's have a look.

40:09.051 --> 40:11.654
I think Harrison was doing
a painting of Grey House.

40:11.687 --> 40:14.043
That'd be amazing if we were in it.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.030
Oh!

40:16.062 --> 40:17.926
- That's us.
- Wow.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.038
Yeah. He put us in the
other ones, too, doing things

40:20.071 --> 40:21.903
before we even did it.

40:22.198 --> 40:24.901
Except we're hardly doing
anything in this one...

40:26.366 --> 40:28.036
It looks like
it doesn't predict a thing.

40:28.069 --> 40:29.971
Well, I can't imagine
Harrison would give us

40:30.004 --> 40:31.940
a painting that didn't mean something.

40:32.413 --> 40:34.374
Let's take a closer look.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.547
Who's that girl with Nick?

40:39.264 --> 40:40.649
I can't tell.

40:40.683 --> 40:42.819
But Grace looks mad at me
about something.

40:42.852 --> 40:44.596
Why would I be mad at you?

40:44.629 --> 40:47.722
- I don't know.
- What'd I do?

40:48.346 --> 40:50.353
Well, at least the two of you
are together.

40:50.385 --> 40:52.160
Yes!

40:53.184 --> 40:57.088
- Except you aren't holding hands.
- That's kind of weird.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.435
Yeah, I thought that guy
knew we were together.

41:01.270 --> 41:03.906
It's probably no big deal.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.442
It's just a painting.

41:08.576 --> 41:09.951
Right.
