WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:02.540
We're off the Sharp case
due to negligence.

00:03.300 --> 00:06.020
You had Sharp in your custody
and now he's dead.

00:06.100 --> 00:09.860
Listen to me, Barton.
Help me and I'll help you.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.700
The weapons were used on the work...

00:13.700 --> 00:14.940
I know the supplier.

00:15.020 --> 00:16.820
Barton's dead.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.860
My contacts tell me he had his
throat cut in the shower.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.020 --> 00:41.340
Sir.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.420
Sir.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.580
It was my decision
to go and see Barton.

00:54.380 --> 00:56.340
Yet Ms Tanner authorised it?

00:56.420 --> 00:58.620
I just thought,
under the circumstances...

00:58.700 --> 01:00.620
Only because I pressurised her.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.420
This is what happens
when rules get broken,

01:05.500 --> 01:10.940
when officers disregard
the law... and their duty.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.700
You were told you were
off the Sharp investigation.

01:14.780 --> 01:17.820
I didn't cause Barton's murder.
You disobeyed a direct order.

01:17.900 --> 01:21.540
There was a robbery.
The three men that did it are dead.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.420
Sharp's killer shot 'em.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.180
He's covering his tracks.
Barton was the next on the list.

01:26.260 --> 01:29.180
For all you know, your prison visit
put him on that list,

01:29.260 --> 01:32.340
if there is a list,
which you also don't know.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.020
You don't know anything.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.140
Which is precisely why your unit
was taken off the Sharp case.

01:37.860 --> 01:41.340
Misjudgement, failure, incompetence.

01:41.420 --> 01:43.540
If you'd just let us do our job,
then we...

01:43.620 --> 01:46.980
Without my support,
you wouldn't have a job at all.

01:47.060 --> 01:49.100
You'd be in front of
a disciplinary board,

01:49.180 --> 01:52.340
answering charges of
gross professional misconduct.

01:53.900 --> 01:59.740
Which is why Ms Tanner authorised you
and not Bishop to visit Barton.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.500
She knew that if anything went awry

02:01.580 --> 02:03.900
that I would step in
to protect my son's career

02:03.980 --> 02:05.940
and, by extension, her own.

02:09.100 --> 02:12.540
Your mother never wanted you
to come into law enforcement.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.900
Maybe she knew you weren't up to it.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.860
I will not have you ruin
my reputation.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.100
This is the last time
I intervene on your behalf.

02:21.180 --> 02:22.940
I can live with that. Sir.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.740
I can live with that, sir.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.060
Yo, man, how did it go? Bad.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.220
That wasn't fair, Pike.
The man doesn't do fair.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.580
For the record, it was Director Pike
that took us off the Sharp case.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.500
Against my advice and better
judgment.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.900
I'm never gonna get
an exec-level promotion.

02:50.980 --> 02:53.540
Do you know why?
Cos I'm not a massive twat.

03:27.580 --> 03:29.740
How you doing, bro?

03:29.820 --> 03:33.100
You seem pretty relaxed
about everything.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.740
Put your weight on your left foot...
Bastard!

03:35.820 --> 03:37.260
Who, him or your dad?

03:37.340 --> 03:39.940
If it's your dad,
I've been thinking that for a while.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.140
I'm an embarrassment, innit?

03:42.220 --> 03:44.860
A stain on his reputation
he wants to get rid of.

03:44.940 --> 03:47.260
He should look in a mirror,
if he's embarrassed.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.260
It's not like it's nothing new,
is it?

03:50.340 --> 03:52.980
One more screw-up... and I'm out.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.860
So, what's the solution, bro?

03:57.580 --> 04:00.340
We don't screw up, then, do we?
Exactly!

04:51.660 --> 04:52.900
Psst. Yo.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.300
Yo.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.203
Question. If you
guys were looking

05:02.216 --> 05:04.020
for a Luger, where
would you start?

05:04.100 --> 05:06.820
A Luger? A P08?

05:09.380 --> 05:11.700
Yeah. Yeah, that kind of thing, yeah.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.580
The same one used
by your friend "Ray"

05:13.660 --> 05:16.500
to murder Darren Brown,
Curtis Cox and Michael Sharp?

05:16.580 --> 05:18.060
But a different one.

05:18.140 --> 05:20.820
So, not the gun
we've been ordered not to go after?

05:20.900 --> 05:22.900
Yes. Not that one.

05:34.900 --> 05:39.180
Nellios... You worked in Trojan
for a lot of years.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.300
You'll know better than anyone.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.500
For me?

05:46.020 --> 05:47.940
OK, listen.

05:48.020 --> 05:50.580
It was Director Pike that took us off
the case, not Tanner.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.780
Jonesy's back this afternoon

05:55.860 --> 05:58.540
and you're the only one
who hasn't signed.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.660
That's cos I don't like Jonesy.
That's why I haven't signed.

06:14.220 --> 06:16.420
This how you spell Jonesy, right?

06:19.740 --> 06:21.380
So?

06:21.780 --> 06:24.940
Well, if you wanted a silencer, too,

06:25.020 --> 06:28.020
I have a list of suspect dealers.
And their addresses?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.900
No. Thanks.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.820
This is a joke.
I signed up for the glamour.

06:55.900 --> 06:59.220
No, you didn't. You signed up
because your dad forced you.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.260
Oh, man. My sneaks, bruv!

07:04.220 --> 07:05.540
This is just London.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.060
Sharp's killer could have got
the gun from anywhere.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.980
No, no, see,
I researched these places.

07:10.060 --> 07:12.220
Your problem is
you're not as meticulous as me.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.260
You're the problem, mate. Why?

07:14.980 --> 07:17.220
Where do you keep your dirty boxers?
Tell me.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.540
Bro, I thought that was
the laundry basket.

07:19.620 --> 07:21.980
Yeah, well,
it's Donna's dressing-up box!

07:22.060 --> 07:23.860
Sorry, mate. I'm getting a flat soon.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.500
Shut up, man.
You think I'm scared of you?

07:28.580 --> 07:30.780
Leave it, before we put
some laxative in your...

07:31.580 --> 07:34.180
He's barking at you, you know.
Whatever, man.

07:34.260 --> 07:35.780
Oh, shut up.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.780
Afternoon, lads. What's up?

07:44.420 --> 07:46.260
Not much, you know.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.580
How can I help you chaps?

07:50.660 --> 07:52.140
We wanna buy a piece.

07:52.220 --> 07:55.260
Sorry, a what?
A fucking nine, bruv!

07:55.340 --> 07:56.980
You know, a gun?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.860
You think I come here
to scrap my car?

07:58.940 --> 08:00.898
Don't know what
you're talking about.

08:00.911 --> 08:02.620
You don't want to sell us a gun?

08:02.700 --> 08:04.580
All right, we'll take it, then.

08:04.660 --> 08:06.540
Get fucked.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.940
Argh! Fuck!

08:08.020 --> 08:10.100
Where are the guns, man?
Where are they?

08:10.180 --> 08:12.500
The money's in there!
It's just a couple of hundred.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.540
It's all I've got. Please!

08:15.580 --> 08:19.140
I'm talking about guns, not money.
See the badge? See the badge?

08:19.220 --> 08:21.140
Yes, I fucking see the badge!

08:21.220 --> 08:23.300
Then you don't mind
if we have a look around?

08:23.380 --> 08:25.980
Good lad.

08:34.299 --> 08:37.740
I don't even wanna touch anything
in here, to be fair.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.260
Disgusting shit.

08:39.940 --> 08:43.140
This place is a waste of our time.
It's nasty, innit?

08:43.220 --> 08:45.540
Nothing? Nothing in there, man.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.860
See? I told. Shut up.

08:49.980 --> 08:53.300
I'll take a cigarette, if you don't
mind. Yeah, help yourself.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.820
Do you want one? I don't smoke.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.900
Let's hope we have better luck
with the next one on the list.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.980
Where's it at?
Just out past Hornchurch.

09:15.060 --> 09:17.460
About two miles on the...
What the...?

09:17.540 --> 09:19.580
Yo. Yo. Yeah.
Come on, man, move!

09:24.940 --> 09:27.100
Reverse! Come on! Reverse!

09:28.020 --> 09:30.180
This guy, man?
Move the car, man!

09:31.060 --> 09:33.580
He wants you to reverse.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.740
Don't reverse.
I'm not reversing.

09:37.940 --> 09:40.420
Polizia. Polizia.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.340
He'll move now.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.580
Oh, man.

09:47.660 --> 09:49.170
Stalling now, yeah? Mm.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.160
What's this guy even doing here,
anyway?

09:51.240 --> 09:55.200
Don't look like he's stalling to me.
It looks like he's panicking.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.520
Do you wanna go and talk to him?
Yeah, we probably should.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.800
No, don't bother.
Stop wasting your time.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.440
Window.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.320
OK? We in your way, man?

10:23.240 --> 10:24.680
No, no.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.000
Sorry, it's my fault.
I should be more... less impatient.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.600
True.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.800
Hey, Bish! Yo.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.680
What's the legal tyre depth?

10:33.760 --> 10:36.200
I believe the legal tyre depth
is 1.6mm.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.080
These are looking a bit bald to me.
Ooh. Problems.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.720
Mind stepping out the car, please,
sir?

10:47.160 --> 10:50.320
Whereabouts do you keep
your insurance documents, mate?

10:51.080 --> 10:52.960
In the front of the car, maybe.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.400
Maybe?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.360
Let me have a look.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.280
I'm hoping it's more than a "maybe",

10:58.360 --> 11:00.880
cos you know you need
your V5C to scrap this.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.760
I mean, that's why you're here,
right, to scrap the car? Hm?

11:09.760 --> 11:11.800
What have you got in your boot?

11:21.960 --> 11:24.120
Excuse me, sir, I'm talking to you.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.960
Can you open the boot, please?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.400
Open the boot, man.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.400
No.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.720
What was that?
The man said no, innit.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.720
It's all right.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.880
Well... I mean, I know we can't
open it.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.800
But I've heard these cars
have a tendency

11:45.880 --> 11:48.760
for the boot to pop open accidently.
I know. I've heard that.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.800
Oh, my gosh. Wow!

12:18.680 --> 12:20.440
Get up.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.960
Bruv, call this in.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.760
She... She's my daughter.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.520
I am arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.280
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm...

12:38.665 --> 12:38.800
You had Sharp in your custody
and now he's dead.

12:35.984 --> 12:39.184
Resuming interview
with asylum seeker, Bakur Nezan,

12:39.264 --> 12:42.824
to ascertain the circumstances
of his daughter's death.

12:46.104 --> 12:50.584
I vowed to do what I could
to make a better life for Dila.

12:50.664 --> 12:53.904
I trusted those traffickers.

12:53.984 --> 12:56.664
I understand, believe me.

12:56.744 --> 12:58.544
You have a daughter?

13:03.735 --> 13:09.375
Look, we can't release her body yet,
but we will treat her with care.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.935
And she's gonna help us
find the men that did this.

13:13.015 --> 13:15.215
We hope you understand
that we will need to run

13:15.295 --> 13:17.975
some identification checks
on both of you.

13:21.095 --> 13:23.255
What was she like?

13:26.375 --> 13:28.095
She loved trucks.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.055
Big ones.

13:30.135 --> 13:31.847
When she knew that's how we were

13:31.860 --> 13:34.015
coming to England,
she was so excited.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.215
Here.

13:39.895 --> 13:41.535
Where's the rest of your family?

13:44.295 --> 13:47.775
My wife... was killed in an air raid,

13:47.855 --> 13:49.535
with my son.

13:50.695 --> 13:53.935
Where did these traffickers take you
when you got to the UK?

13:55.895 --> 13:58.975
It was a place with many buildings.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.615
They took us to one
with a locked door.

14:02.455 --> 14:04.255
Me and Dila, we were the last.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.455
They came when we were sleeping
and took her.

14:08.535 --> 14:10.495
They took your girl?

14:14.095 --> 14:16.095
They stole her from me.

14:18.535 --> 14:21.935
It took me a day and a night
to break out of that building.

14:22.855 --> 14:25.735
In front of the building,
I found the car.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.935
In the car was my precious daughter.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.095
What were you doing at this yard?

14:39.655 --> 14:41.135
I went there to buy a gun.

14:42.295 --> 14:43.975
To kill the people who did this.

14:46.655 --> 14:48.975
And then myself.

14:53.855 --> 14:56.535
It's great. Huge. It's got this...

14:56.615 --> 14:58.175
amazing view.

14:58.255 --> 14:59.735
I'll send you photos.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.495
Nah, nah, I'd prefer
to see it in person, babe.

15:05.295 --> 15:06.895
You OK, baby?

15:06.975 --> 15:08.575
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

15:08.655 --> 15:11.055
I'm just having a really tough day
and I...

15:12.055 --> 15:14.495
..I just wanted to hear your voice.
That's all.

15:16.455 --> 15:18.295
I've got to go. Love you.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.735
Love you. OK.

15:29.175 --> 15:30.935
You've never mentioned this before.

15:31.015 --> 15:32.975
I wasn't sure
I could get it off the ground.

15:33.055 --> 15:34.975
Which is where I come in?

15:35.055 --> 15:36.655
Which is where you come in. OK.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.095
Look, the site is
ready, the plans are

15:39.108 --> 15:41.175
done, the keys are
in the digger.

15:41.255 --> 15:44.935
All I need is for the S-ten-six
to be signed off and it's a go.

15:45.655 --> 15:48.535
OK, so what sort of timeframe
are we playing with here?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.095
Oh, you know me. Yesterday.

15:50.175 --> 15:52.415
Of course.

15:52.495 --> 15:55.095
Look, I want this development
to be part of my legacy.

15:55.175 --> 15:58.415
1,500 social-housing units.

15:58.495 --> 16:00.615
And just imagine
having that up my sleeve

16:00.695 --> 16:02.455
when I make my run for Mayor.

16:03.455 --> 16:05.015
Oh.

16:05.095 --> 16:06.535
Yeah, I know. But look...

16:06.615 --> 16:09.735
The first female Mayor of London
has got a nice ring to it.

16:09.815 --> 16:12.695
Yeah. Yeah, it really does.

16:12.775 --> 16:15.695
As long as you don't bring out
the shoulder pads, we'll be fine.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.375
Look, erm...

16:17.455 --> 16:20.895
Do me a favour, just take a look at
it, let me know what you think.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.575
Hello.

16:23.655 --> 16:26.975
Yes. Yeah, OK. I'll be there.

16:27.055 --> 16:28.831
He says that he and
his daughter are

16:28.844 --> 16:30.775
Kurds, escaping
persecution from Syria.

16:30.855 --> 16:33.015
He's claiming asylum.

16:33.095 --> 16:35.975
Where were they brought in?
He has no idea.

16:36.055 --> 16:39.255
Look, I say we get him one.
We could take this.

16:39.335 --> 16:41.015
Uncovering a
people-smuggling ring

16:41.028 --> 16:42.815
sounds like a good
use of your time.

16:42.895 --> 16:44.975
Christ knows we could
do with a result now.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.535
Ma'am? Bakur was looking for a gun
at the breaker's yard.

16:51.615 --> 16:53.735
We think that killer Ray
got his from there.

16:53.815 --> 16:55.095
I don't want to hear.

16:55.895 --> 16:59.335
When you say you don't want to
hear... We're off the Sharp case.

16:59.415 --> 17:01.495
Get out.

17:04.175 --> 17:06.175
Listen, man,

17:06.255 --> 17:08.734
if Bakur went there to get a gun,

17:08.815 --> 17:11.415
we might have been right
about Ray's stash the whole time.

17:11.494 --> 17:12.935
We'll trace the gun. Yeah?

17:13.015 --> 17:16.415
Let's just concentrate on a man
that's lost his daughter right now.

17:24.655 --> 17:27.295
That my new call sign, is it?
Fuckface?

17:27.375 --> 17:30.895
Nothing new about it. Been calling
you a lot worse for a lot longer.

17:32.575 --> 17:34.855
If you're gonna hit me, mate,
let's not do it here.

17:34.935 --> 17:36.935
We both like this job.

17:39.255 --> 17:43.215
I can't help how I feel
and neither can Soph.

17:47.855 --> 17:50.055
You know what, man?

17:50.135 --> 17:52.535
I hope you make a go of it
and I wish you all the best.

17:54.655 --> 17:56.655
Thanks, mate.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.935
I trust my friends.

18:00.015 --> 18:03.135
You got a long way to go
before that ever happens.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.015
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

18:05.095 --> 18:06.615
But now we're all square, yeah?

18:08.295 --> 18:10.255
Let's get the ball rolling, man.

18:10.975 --> 18:14.215
I know you got my back and everything,
but in public like that? Damn.

18:14.295 --> 18:17.775
It was needed.
Yeah, you're right! Fuck him!

18:24.055 --> 18:26.855
She was actually a remarkably healthy
young girl.

18:26.935 --> 18:29.735
Which is undoubtedly
why they chose her.

18:29.815 --> 18:31.255
If you look here,

18:31.335 --> 18:34.615
there's a second incision...
like that on the left side.

18:35.775 --> 18:37.615
A rib has also been removed.

18:37.695 --> 18:39.535
What for?

18:39.615 --> 18:41.695
To facilitate organ removal.

18:42.975 --> 18:46.615
Both kidneys were taken,
by someone with medical training.

18:48.255 --> 18:50.535
She was alive when they operated.

18:50.615 --> 18:55.015
Unconscious, but alive. The kidneys
are in better condition that way,

18:55.095 --> 18:57.455
improving the chances
of a successful transplant.

19:22.415 --> 19:24.295
Thank you.

19:29.295 --> 19:31.015
Pike?

19:31.095 --> 19:32.855
You all right?

19:32.935 --> 19:34.935
Yeah. Good.

19:41.575 --> 19:43.695
That was a bit rough still, man.

19:45.055 --> 19:47.055
How do we tell him, bro?

19:47.135 --> 19:49.295
How can we tell him? Mm.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.855
All I could see was Ali lying there.

19:51.935 --> 19:53.735
It doesn't feel right.

19:53.815 --> 19:55.655
What doesn't?

19:55.735 --> 19:57.895
Bruv, we're Feds...

19:57.975 --> 19:59.975
This is my job.

20:00.055 --> 20:02.215
But, in there, I was a dad.

20:04.574 --> 20:06.974
Listen, I'll tell him.
Don't worry about it.

20:07.054 --> 20:08.534
Bro...

20:08.614 --> 20:10.334
It has to be me.

20:13.174 --> 20:15.134
Oh, no.

20:27.614 --> 20:29.694
Sorry. It's OK.

20:31.294 --> 20:34.494
I understand.
I have two daughters.

20:35.374 --> 20:37.934
Ali and Donna.

20:39.854 --> 20:42.534
I failed mine.

20:44.414 --> 20:46.774
I failed my daughter.

20:48.054 --> 20:50.174
I am not a father.

20:51.374 --> 20:54.854
He's broken.

20:54.934 --> 20:58.574
You really think he's gonna help you
bring down a smuggling ring?

21:08.014 --> 21:09.734
Bakur, listen to me.

21:09.814 --> 21:12.974
You don't fail... if you don't let
them get away with this.

21:14.054 --> 21:16.134
Help me find these men.

21:17.254 --> 21:21.254
I would give my life to find them...
and I tried.

21:22.854 --> 21:25.414
But where do you look? I don't know.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.734
No.

21:26.814 --> 21:29.894
Don't tell me what you don't know.
Tell me what you do.

21:38.094 --> 21:42.214
So, they concealed you in the truck
in Southern Italy?

21:42.974 --> 21:44.334
Yeah.

21:44.414 --> 21:46.094
When the truck stopped at the docks,

21:46.174 --> 21:48.814
did you hear any other cars
parking around you?

21:48.894 --> 21:50.934
Was your container lifted up?

21:51.014 --> 21:52.694
Lifted.

21:52.774 --> 21:54.774
It was lifted up.

21:54.854 --> 21:57.334
What is the most likely exit port
in Southern Italy?

21:57.414 --> 22:00.774
Uh... UK-Italy,
it's gonna be Venice or Genoa.

22:00.854 --> 22:05.974
How long were you at sea?
Seven days, perhaps. Maybe eight.

22:06.054 --> 22:07.734
Genoa

22:07.814 --> 22:10.614
OK, I need a list of Europol's
top traffickers and smugglers

22:10.694 --> 22:13.174
coming out of Genoa. OK, on it.

22:13.254 --> 22:15.654
So, when the container
drove out of the docks,

22:15.734 --> 22:19.334
did you hear a steady rumble,
the truck driving straight?

22:19.414 --> 22:21.414
A motorway, you mean?

22:21.494 --> 22:23.174
Yeah. Yeah.

22:24.174 --> 22:25.694
Yeah, but not for long.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.934
20 minutes, maybe.

22:29.934 --> 22:31.094
OK.

22:32.134 --> 22:34.174
They have got to have come in here.

22:34.254 --> 22:36.694
These are most likely,
according to Europol.

22:36.774 --> 22:38.174
So plenty to choose from.

22:38.254 --> 22:40.694
So he spends two to three hours
driving around the city

22:40.774 --> 22:43.534
with his daughter in the back
of the car but he never leaves it.

22:43.614 --> 22:45.134
That's a radius.
Yeah, a big one.

22:45.214 --> 22:47.214
Well, narrow it down!

22:48.894 --> 22:52.054
Any luck on the plates?
Nah, fake, as you'd expect.

22:52.134 --> 22:54.854
Do you remember
any particular landmarks?

23:01.694 --> 23:03.534
What about signs?

23:03.614 --> 23:06.814
Names of businesses?
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

23:07.614 --> 23:09.814
The colour of the door,
for instance? Anything.

23:09.894 --> 23:11.854
I don't know. There was a...

23:12.854 --> 23:16.254
There was a tower...
a big brick chimney.

23:16.334 --> 23:18.134
Yeah?

23:19.854 --> 23:21.814
I don't remember.

23:24.814 --> 23:26.854
I just wanted my daughter.

23:28.534 --> 23:30.854
Oh, man, look. It's OK.

23:30.934 --> 23:33.014
I'm sorry. It's OK.

23:37.174 --> 23:39.774
All right, let's leave it there
for tonight.

24:33.854 --> 24:35.534
Oh, he's here, man. Fuck me.

24:35.614 --> 24:37.374
Dawn Of The Dead, yeah?

24:37.454 --> 24:39.414
Yeah, something like that.
You good?

24:39.494 --> 24:41.734
Yeah, man, cool.
What happened to you last night?

24:41.814 --> 24:43.734
Well, you now.... Just...

24:43.814 --> 24:46.734
What? That social worker thing?
No, man, she was not a thing.

24:46.814 --> 24:48.494
Suspects for Bakur to look at.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.694
Oh, thank you. Cheers.

24:52.054 --> 24:55.214
Why are you talking my business?
I'm saying did you beat?

24:55.294 --> 24:57.614
No, of course I didn't.
Are you sure?

25:08.934 --> 25:10.654
That's him.

25:12.694 --> 25:14.014
When did you see him?

25:14.094 --> 25:17.254
When they took us from the truck
to the locked building.

25:17.334 --> 25:19.894
This is the man I'm looking for.

25:19.974 --> 25:22.014
Not you. Me.

25:30.771 --> 25:32.331
You all right?

25:33.411 --> 25:35.291
Yeah. Good.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.981
So, I've sorted you a hostel
for tonight.

25:39.353 --> 25:42.073
Nothing fancy, but it's clean.

25:42.153 --> 25:44.153
Oh...

25:44.233 --> 25:45.833
For you. Ah.

25:46.593 --> 25:48.233
You take care.

25:49.313 --> 25:51.993
You... will find him?

25:55.593 --> 26:00.953
Gazim Dushku, aka "Sergio Roshi"
and probably more besides.

26:01.033 --> 26:03.993
He's on Europol's database
but we haven't seen him here before.

26:04.073 --> 26:05.793
He's Albanian, top guy in a crew

26:05.873 --> 26:08.593
that usually deals with
people trafficking and smuggling.

26:08.673 --> 26:11.033
They've been running
the European routes for years.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.673
It looks like the UK's new business.

26:12.753 --> 26:15.073
Bring him in, gold stars till
Christmas.

26:16.233 --> 26:17.833
Here, here and here

26:17.913 --> 26:21.073
are light-industrial parks
within 50 minutes of the docks,

26:21.153 --> 26:24.513
none more than a 25-minute stretch
on the dual carriageway.

26:24.593 --> 26:27.273
But look at this one...
"Colour of the door, for instance?"

26:27.353 --> 26:29.753
"Anything.
I don't know. There was a...

26:30.793 --> 26:33.433
There was a tower,
a big brick chimney."

26:33.513 --> 26:35.433
You know what? I fucking love you.

26:35.513 --> 26:37.593
Nell deserves a round of applause.
It's on.

26:37.673 --> 26:39.767
Europol have been tracking
a container linked

26:39.780 --> 26:41.793
to Gazim's gang, shipping
out of Rotterdam.

26:41.873 --> 26:43.833
It's due in here now. Let's go.

27:47.873 --> 27:49.873
Load up.

27:53.553 --> 27:56.113
Pike to Nell. We're in position.

27:57.313 --> 27:59.553
There he is.

27:59.633 --> 28:02.593
We see Gazim.
I repeat, we have eyes on Gazim.

28:02.673 --> 28:05.833
What's your ETA?
Closing in. ETA 50 seconds.

28:05.913 --> 28:08.233
Rear's secure.
They ain't getting out this way.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.433
Remember, there's people
in that container.

28:10.513 --> 28:12.793
Let's not shoot the people
we're here to protect.

28:15.273 --> 28:18.273
Jesus, that's an old woman.
Some fucked-up shit.

28:18.993 --> 28:20.513
Ready to nail this motherfucker.

28:21.433 --> 28:25.193
I count about 15 civilians.
20 seconds out. Let's go.

28:27.553 --> 28:29.553
Making final approach on York Way.

28:29.633 --> 28:31.993
No. No, that's gonna lead you
right out front.

28:32.073 --> 28:33.993
For fuck's sake!

28:34.073 --> 28:36.353
Fucking idiots, man!
Drop your weapon!

28:53.993 --> 28:55.433
Stop!

29:03.953 --> 29:05.713
Shit!

29:06.753 --> 29:09.033
Get out!

29:12.513 --> 29:15.713
Pike! Pike!

29:42.993 --> 29:44.473
Come here!

30:00.393 --> 30:02.593
Fuck!

30:55.593 --> 30:57.353
Fucker!

30:59.753 --> 31:02.033
Yaargh! What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

31:02.113 --> 31:04.313
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

31:04.393 --> 31:07.753
He fucking killed a kid! And you're
gonna leave yours without a dad?

31:07.833 --> 31:10.393
What the fuck do you know?
You don't have fucking kids!

31:10.473 --> 31:13.873
Fuck you! Hey, bro, relax, man.

31:14.593 --> 31:16.833
Bro, come on, man. Come on!

31:19.113 --> 31:20.913
Just cool down, man.

31:27.033 --> 31:28.833
Stay there, man.

31:29.593 --> 31:31.233
Fuck!

31:46.313 --> 31:49.433
This guy pepper-sprayed you
good and proper. Just hold still.

31:50.713 --> 31:53.593
W... Ohh! What are you doing?

31:54.193 --> 31:56.993
You flinched. Because you're putting
shit in my eye.

31:57.073 --> 31:58.713
Are you finished? Yeah.

31:58.793 --> 32:01.353
Go on, just do it. Do the other eye.
But just do...

32:01.433 --> 32:03.993
Just... Just hold still.

32:04.073 --> 32:06.033
OK. Go on, then, do it.

32:07.033 --> 32:08.913
Done. Ah.

32:12.193 --> 32:14.353
Good? Yeah, thanks.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.713
You are a rubbish patient.
You know that?

32:17.393 --> 32:19.833
Doctor's rubbish bedside manner,
more like.

32:37.073 --> 32:39.073
What was he doing, Bish?

32:42.593 --> 32:44.633
I don't know.

32:46.313 --> 32:48.353
Fallen out with your boyfriend?

32:48.433 --> 32:49.553
Please.

32:49.633 --> 32:52.233
I don't know.
What about your girlfriend?

32:52.953 --> 32:55.233
What girlfriend? Social worker?

32:55.313 --> 32:57.313
What? Netflix and chill?

32:57.393 --> 33:01.673
Listen, that was all flix
and no chill, trust me. You know.

33:01.753 --> 33:04.073
We just got there
and the next thing I remember,

33:04.153 --> 33:06.633
I woke up with all my clothes on.
Nothing happened.

33:06.713 --> 33:08.153
Do I believe you?

33:09.393 --> 33:11.393
I wouldn't lie to you.

33:12.513 --> 33:13.953
See you upstairs.

33:26.993 --> 33:28.993
Mm. Eat, man. Please.

33:30.593 --> 33:33.233
I know why you did this
and I thank you.

33:33.313 --> 33:35.313
You didn't need to.

33:35.393 --> 33:37.673
Hello, lovelies.

33:38.353 --> 33:41.633
Babe, you'll never guess
what Charlotte told me today.

33:41.713 --> 33:43.353
She's running for Mayor...

33:43.433 --> 33:45.393
Oh. Hi.

33:45.473 --> 33:46.833
Hi, Mummy. Hi, baby.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.993
Sorry... This is Bakur.

33:50.073 --> 33:52.073
I was taking him to a hostel.

33:52.153 --> 33:55.633
Bakur's an asylum seeker.
Were you really smuggled here?

33:55.713 --> 33:57.233
Oh.

33:57.313 --> 33:58.673
Yeah.

33:58.753 --> 34:00.713
I must go.

34:00.793 --> 34:03.913
Not because of me, I hope?
I must.

34:03.993 --> 34:05.713
Please, stay. You're welcome.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.033
Oh, right... Um... You ready, yeah?

34:08.112 --> 34:09.913
Yeah. See you, babe.

34:12.273 --> 34:13.873
Nice.

34:13.953 --> 34:16.281
I'll ask Arjana to
find someone who

34:16.293 --> 34:18.632
specialises in
asylum applications.

34:19.713 --> 34:23.753
I... don't have the words
to express how much I appreciate

34:23.833 --> 34:25.592
what you've done for me.

34:25.672 --> 34:28.833
You're a good man,
who did his best for his family.

34:30.753 --> 34:32.753
Family is all that matters.

34:32.833 --> 34:36.233
Look after yours, my friend.
Your girls are very special.

34:36.313 --> 34:38.273
Take care.

34:44.193 --> 34:47.473
In case you were wondering,
I didn't ask Pike to punch you,

34:47.553 --> 34:49.112
but I'm glad he did.

34:49.193 --> 34:50.993
Come on, man.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.753
I know you guys can't jump. I didn't
know you couldn't climb either.

34:54.833 --> 34:56.873
Left foot, left foot!

34:56.953 --> 35:00.193
Explain again what I'm doing here.

35:02.313 --> 35:04.633
This guy says he doesn't deal
in guns.

35:04.713 --> 35:07.673
An illegal immigrant said
he came here to get a gun.

35:07.753 --> 35:09.433
I think that's worth checking out.

35:09.513 --> 35:11.346
I definitely think
this guy provided

35:11.359 --> 35:13.153
Ray with the gun
that killed Sharp.

35:13.233 --> 35:15.193
Yeah, but... why me?

35:16.873 --> 35:18.953
This is a highly-sensitive...

35:19.033 --> 35:22.713
borderline gross misconduct
reconnaissance we're on, you know,

35:22.793 --> 35:26.553
and whoever led the way into here
would get in some serious trouble.

35:26.633 --> 35:27.873
Oh!

35:27.953 --> 35:30.193
Watch out for the dog, man.

35:41.713 --> 35:43.633
Whoa, easy, easy, yeah.

35:43.713 --> 35:45.113
Whoa, whoa.

35:45.193 --> 35:47.353
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

35:48.153 --> 35:50.113
You stay here. You stay here.

35:50.193 --> 35:51.913
What? You stay here.

35:55.833 --> 35:57.044
Psst!

35:57.045 --> 35:59.085
He's left his door open.

36:03.285 --> 36:04.925
See?

36:33.365 --> 36:34.765
Ohh.

36:36.645 --> 36:39.925
See, this is the problem. Pike never
fucking looks anywhere properly.

36:42.805 --> 36:46.205
Found a load of guns, man.
I'm gonna call it in.

36:48.005 --> 36:50.365
What are you...
What can I say? They like me.

36:50.445 --> 36:53.125
Why does that not surprise me?

36:56.325 --> 36:57.965
After you.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.525
I'm not gonna let you
go behind me, am I?

37:32.205 --> 37:34.005
Fuck.

37:39.085 --> 37:40.685
Shall I call it in?

37:41.485 --> 37:43.485
Yeah. Call it in.

37:52.931 --> 37:55.251
Yo. Oh.

37:56.371 --> 37:59.131
All right?
What happened to you last night?

37:59.211 --> 38:01.771
Listen, man,
I need to talk to you about it.

38:01.851 --> 38:04.611
Don't ask me how I know, but the
scrapyard guy was a gun dealer

38:04.691 --> 38:06.891
and when I was at...
We'll talk after the kids...

38:06.971 --> 38:09.331
Yeah, yeah.
Find your shoes. Come on!

38:09.411 --> 38:11.491
Dad, where are they?
They're your shoes.

38:11.571 --> 38:14.091
You have to look for them.
Come off your phone, please.

38:14.171 --> 38:16.611
I've told you already.
Hey. I can take Ali to school,

38:16.691 --> 38:18.691
if it's easier,
you can just deal with Donna.

38:18.771 --> 38:21.411
Yeah? Yeah, man.
That's what uncles are for.

38:21.491 --> 38:23.571
All right. Off your phone.
All right.

38:23.651 --> 38:25.878
If I knew you was making
chicken, I would have

38:25.891 --> 38:27.891
come. Don't touch that.
It was for Bakur.

38:27.971 --> 38:30.531
He came for dinner last night.

38:31.331 --> 38:33.971
Oh, come on, man.
The man just lost his family.

38:34.051 --> 38:35.891
It's the least I could do.

38:35.971 --> 38:38.531
Well, I don't like him.
And he doesn't like you either.

38:38.611 --> 38:41.971
Can you get off your phone, please?
Get off your phone!

38:42.051 --> 38:45.011
Where's your bag? This one?
Get out. Get on.

38:45.091 --> 38:48.171
Hey, take your time, man.
I'll be ten minutes.

38:48.971 --> 38:50.611
15.

38:51.491 --> 38:54.251
Are you jealous
you're being replaced by Bakur?

38:54.331 --> 38:57.171
No. Don't be silly.
I just don't see why it's acceptable

38:57.251 --> 39:00.251
that he brings any Tom, Dick and Aziz
back for tea and biscuits.

39:00.331 --> 39:02.931
He didn't stay. Don't worry.
You still have Donna's room.

39:03.011 --> 39:04.651
I'm getting my own place in a while.

39:04.731 --> 39:06.611
With your girlfriend,
the social worker?

39:06.691 --> 39:10.771
Hey. For the record, for the record,
nothing happened, all right?

39:10.851 --> 39:13.211
That cos you're still into Sophie?

39:13.971 --> 39:16.851
You see you, yeah...
Listen, you... you're little people.

39:16.931 --> 39:19.571
That big people business,
you understand me? All right?

39:19.651 --> 39:21.091
All right? Yes!

39:21.171 --> 39:23.611
What do you mean "yes"?
I won the game. Just here.

39:23.691 --> 39:24.891
What? Here's good.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.811
What do you mean here?
Here's good.

39:26.891 --> 39:29.251
Right here? Sure?
Yeah, here's fine. I'm sure.

39:29.331 --> 39:31.211
Are you sure, yeah?
Who's that boy there?

39:31.291 --> 39:33.331
I don't really... Bye! Bye!

39:33.411 --> 39:36.171
OK. Have a nice day.
OK, learn... learn things.

39:36.251 --> 39:37.411
Bye.

39:37.491 --> 39:39.851
How is that kid 12 years old?
I don't get it.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.251
Hey, Nell, how's it going?

40:07.331 --> 40:09.680
I'm tracking private
purchases of medical

40:09.693 --> 40:11.771
equipment used in
organ transplants.

40:11.851 --> 40:15.051
Good. Gazim's happy to cough up
for people smuggling.

40:15.131 --> 40:18.971
Flatly denies organ harvesting. He's
outraged by the very idea of it.

40:19.051 --> 40:21.931
Yeah, of course. He reckons it's
a set-up by his rival.

40:22.011 --> 40:25.611
When you've got a minute, can you
check out this name? Sercan Kubat.

40:25.691 --> 40:28.051
Sercan Kubat. Got it. Kam? Yo.

40:29.611 --> 40:31.251
Sercan Kubat.

40:37.331 --> 40:38.811
You been getting my messages?

40:38.891 --> 40:40.531
The scrapyard guy is dead.

40:40.611 --> 40:42.571
Double-tap head shot...
Mate, listen.

40:42.651 --> 40:45.331
Ali's school just sent me a text
to say she's absent.

40:45.411 --> 40:47.771
You did drop her off, right?
Yeah, of course I did.

40:47.851 --> 40:49.811
What, at the gates?
You saw her go in?

40:51.851 --> 40:55.451
Well, yeah. She must be there.
Hold on. I've got a call coming in.

40:55.531 --> 40:57.051
Oh, it's her.

40:58.531 --> 41:00.892
Listen, little girl,
if you're bunking

41:00.905 --> 41:02.851
lessons, yeah, you know I'll...

41:32.971 --> 41:34.451
Bishop!

41:49.771 --> 41:51.251
Sit down.

42:00.411 --> 42:02.411
You OK?

42:04.131 --> 42:06.131
She's fine.

42:06.811 --> 42:09.091
Unless you've brought your friends.

42:10.651 --> 42:12.371
Who are you?

42:13.731 --> 42:17.091
As your friends will discover,
if they haven't already...

42:17.171 --> 42:19.131
my name is Sercan Kubat.

42:20.211 --> 42:22.211
I traffic in this and that.

42:22.291 --> 42:25.011
Organs, when the price is right.

42:26.331 --> 42:30.411
And, believe me, a financier whose
child needs a kidney

42:30.491 --> 42:32.491
will pay a very great deal of money.

42:32.571 --> 42:37.051
And my associates and I
have no issues providing them.

42:37.131 --> 42:39.131
Dila wasn't your daughter.

42:41.451 --> 42:45.491
My daughter died two years ago with
the rest of my family. Air raid.

42:45.571 --> 42:46.971
Bullshit.

42:48.571 --> 42:52.531
The more truth that is in the lie,
the more believable it is.

43:03.251 --> 43:05.531
He's not picking up.

43:05.611 --> 43:08.891
What's his location?
Yeah. Phone's offline. GPS is dead.

43:08.971 --> 43:12.091
OK, try his daughter Ali.
What's she got to do with it?

43:12.171 --> 43:13.731
Just try her!

43:17.691 --> 43:20.051
Talk to me!
Yeah, all right. I'm searching.

43:22.251 --> 43:23.891
Right, it's a cafe on North Street.

43:23.971 --> 43:27.011
I'll send you over the co-ordinates.
Got it.

43:29.891 --> 43:31.651
Oh, fuck, man.

43:52.771 --> 43:56.171
Listen to me, baby.
It's all right, OK?

43:56.931 --> 43:58.451
I promise.

43:59.371 --> 44:01.571
Your colleagues will be looking
for me.

44:02.571 --> 44:04.051
You must divert them.

44:05.051 --> 44:09.611
Otherwise, I'll find your family
and kill them while you watch.

44:13.251 --> 44:15.371
I know where your house is.

44:16.371 --> 44:20.771
I know where your wife works,
where your children go to school.

44:20.851 --> 44:22.891
And so do my associates.

44:23.891 --> 44:26.771
Arrest me and my people will find
them.

44:27.771 --> 44:30.731
They are safe... as long as I'm safe.

44:34.211 --> 44:35.811
Do you understand?

44:39.691 --> 44:41.411
Yes.

44:48.611 --> 44:50.931
We'll never see each other again.

44:56.091 --> 44:58.091
I'm so sorry.

45:04.691 --> 45:07.091
Hey! Hey, stop!
Don't run, you little...

45:10.531 --> 45:12.611
Oi, Bish! Bish!

45:13.331 --> 45:15.891
Oi, Bish! No! No!

45:18.691 --> 45:20.211
Bish!

45:22.811 --> 45:24.811
Bish, man. Bish, no!

45:27.731 --> 45:29.891
What's wrong with you?
We have to let him go!

45:29.971 --> 45:32.691
You don't understand!
He played you for a fool!

45:32.771 --> 45:34.356
You let him in your
fucking house!

45:34.369 --> 45:36.011
Who do you think
you're talking to?

45:36.091 --> 45:38.691
What the fuck?

45:40.611 --> 45:42.611
What the hell is wrong with you?

46:09.251 --> 46:10.891
Sorry, baby.

46:14.171 --> 46:15.771
Aaaah!

46:29.051 --> 46:31.771
I need you to tell me where Bakur is.

46:31.851 --> 46:34.891
You think Pike will forgive you
if you deliver his head on a plate?

46:34.971 --> 46:37.251
Is Bakur really coming to kill us?

46:37.331 --> 46:39.171
You did act like a father
and not a cop.

46:41.291 --> 46:44.691
Take the kids upstairs. I'm going
outside. There's someone out there.

46:47.011 --> 46:50.611
You need to know the truth...
before you sign your life away.
