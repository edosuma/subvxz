[Players] Woo!

03:09.523 --> 03:10.523
Ah!

03:15.796 --> 03:17.729
All right, this is what I got.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.731
I got right Z-mode.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.366
25 count on two.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.502

Blue 42.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.338

Set hut!

03:45.326 --> 03:48.594

03:48.596 --> 03:49.995
Let's go right, Z-tight.

[Greg]
Field goal team's ready.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.117
No, no, no.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.584
We're finishing
this game right now.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.922
All right, now, right
slot, Z return, 46...

04:16.923 --> 04:18.724
But they keep
crashing my side, coach.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.625
I know, he's gonna crash, okay?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.661
So we just bounce it
a little bit outside,

04:22.663 --> 04:23.979
and then cut it back up.

04:23.980 --> 04:25.296
Just bounce it a little
bit to the outside,

04:25.299 --> 04:26.565
cut it back up,
and he'll bite ya.

04:26.567 --> 04:27.633
Okay? Okay?

04:27.635 --> 04:29.001
[Benny] It sounds good.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.368
[Vick] It's all you,
buddy, it's all you.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.336
Let's go.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.639
(team clapping)

04:33.641 --> 04:34.873
We got a big stop right here.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.453
[Quarterback] Blue 42.

(time clock buzzing)

05:15.616 --> 05:18.417
(crowd cheering)

05:24.625 --> 05:25.557
That's what I'm talking about!

05:25.559 --> 05:27.993
That's what I'm talking about!

05:43.644 --> 05:46.478
(team celebrating)

05:46.480 --> 05:47.946
Come on, come on!

05:51.118 --> 05:53.452
Okay, okay, bring
it in, bring it in.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.953
All right.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.054
It was a good game.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.723
It's not a great game.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.258
That's one game.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.792
We've got a lot of
games to go, all right?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.694
We'll celebrate big when
we win state, you hear me?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.396
Special, special, Benny.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.864
Special night,
buddy, special night.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.965
Take 'em home.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.534
[Team Member] One, two, three!

06:09.536 --> 06:10.602
[Team] Saints win!

06:10.604 --> 06:11.436
Saints win!

06:11.438 --> 06:12.070
Saints win!

06:12.072 --> 06:15.006
(team cheering)

06:19.813 --> 06:21.713
Hey, good game tonight.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.715
[Mark] Let's go.

06:23.650 --> 06:24.483
What is your deal?

06:24.485 --> 06:25.917
You guys won.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.119
I didn't play.

06:27.121 --> 06:27.953
Yes, you did.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.488
You were on kickoffs.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.889
And you almost returned
that shanked punt.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.957
Dad, that's special teams.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.125
You and I both know
that's bullshit.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.127
Let's go.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.495
Dad!

06:36.497 --> 06:38.029
That kind of language
isn't necessary.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.965
You guys played great out there.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.833
You're gonna get some
chances for more play time

06:41.835 --> 06:42.968
later in the season.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.002
You guys goin' to Tommy's?

06:44.004 --> 06:44.836
Yeah, bro, let's go!

06:44.838 --> 06:46.071
[Mark] Hell, yeah.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.973
Mark, your mother's
got dinner at home.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.975
Then I want more playing time.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.760
What am I supposed
to do about it?

06:51.761 --> 06:53.544
[Mark] I don't know, do
somethin', dad, you're rich.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.479
[Drew] Mark!

06:54.481 --> 06:55.414
[Mark] You guys full here?

06:55.416 --> 06:56.681
Oh, I'm gettin' in this one.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.318
Where did I go
wrong with that kid?

06:59.319 --> 07:00.886
It was like Barry Sanders
out there tonight, right?

07:00.888 --> 07:01.953
It's crazy.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.422
It's crazy.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.823
You played a good game, man.
I appreciate that.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.091
I'm gonna hit
Tommy's, you wanna come?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.025
- Can't, man.
- Sure?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.126
Mom wants me home, I'm sure.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.578
All right.

07:09.579 --> 07:11.379
I'll see you later.
All right, man, see you.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.037
(sighs)

07:21.909 --> 07:25.076
(car horn honking)

07:25.879 --> 07:28.880
(moderate music)

07:41.562 --> 07:45.063
(phone ringing)

07:45.065 --> 07:46.598
I'm sorry, Benny.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.134
It's just not good enough
for a college application.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.002
I don't see what's
got you excited

07:51.004 --> 07:52.637
about going into sports science.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.539
But that's what they
want to read about, right?

07:54.541 --> 07:56.475
Write about what you
want to write about.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.477
Don't worry about what
they want to read.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.011
What means a lot to you?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.848
(bell ringing)

08:13.627 --> 08:16.061
(door closing)

08:21.001 --> 08:22.000
Okay.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.000
[Tom] You never quit, do you?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.202
[Vick] Oh.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.036
Hey.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.905
Tom Price, Auburn.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.840
Hey, Tom, good to meet you.

08:28.842 --> 08:29.908
I get you a Coke or somethin'?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.209
[Tom] Oh, no,
you're good, coach.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.711
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.945
I just wanted to come by here

08:33.947 --> 08:35.746
and shake your hand
before the game on Friday.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.847
[Vick] Okay.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.015
I'll be there, I'll be watchin'.

08:38.018 --> 08:38.950
Good.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.251
I'll be lookin' for talent.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.553
Keep things goin' the
way they're goin',

08:41.554 --> 08:43.788
and you win out on Friday,

08:43.789 --> 08:45.690
you might just be lookin'
at a front office.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.958
If that sounds
interesting to you.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.060
That sounds damn interestin'.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.612
Hell, yeah.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.163
I got all my chips
in your corner, coach.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.266
I will see you on Friday.

08:54.268 --> 08:55.800
[Vick] Okay.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.202
Thank you.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.071
(phone ringing)

09:06.046 --> 09:07.245
[Drew] Coach Trenton?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.580
Yeah.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.148
[Drew] You got a minute?

09:10.150 --> 09:11.150
Drew?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.952
Yeah, what can I do for you?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.020
What's on your mind?

09:22.029 --> 09:23.194
You're a good dad.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.896
But if Mark wants
more playin' time,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.264
he's gonna have to work harder

09:26.266 --> 09:28.233
and get in more
reps after practice.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.834
[Drew] We are big-time donors

09:29.836 --> 09:31.236
to this football program, coach.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.837
Ah.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.873
You wanna come run a
championship football team,

09:34.875 --> 09:36.341
be my guest.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.309
Benny!

09:37.310 --> 09:38.276
- Yes, sir?
- Come on in.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.644
No, no, no, I'll come back.

09:39.646 --> 09:40.946
I'll come back another time.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.247
[Vick] I am never
too busy for you, son.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.081
Come right on in.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.150
Here, have a seat.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.852
What you got?

09:50.190 --> 09:53.058
All right, so I've been
thinking a lot about college.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.159
But I ain't smart like my mama,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.094
so I don't wanna be no lawyer.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.930
But I do wanna go and
study something, you know?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.933
You talked to Coach
Dykes at SMU, right?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.234
Yes, sir.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.271
He told me if I played
football, I'd be a sure shot.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.172
Great.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.640
Then you're on your way.

10:11.111 --> 10:11.943
Well?

10:11.945 --> 10:12.945
What's the problem?

10:14.681 --> 10:16.014
You know, my mom,

10:16.016 --> 10:18.683
she don't want me playin'
after high school, coach.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.285
She barely let me
play this season.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.289
You makin' all As and Bs?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.857
I got a B.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.158
Two, I think, maybe.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.162
So you're not gonna get
no academic scholarship.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.265
(laughs)

10:34.267 --> 10:36.067
Okay.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.636
But here's the deal.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.905
Right now your mama's gotta
sign permission slips,

10:40.907 --> 10:43.775
and she's gotta help
you pay for the gear

10:43.777 --> 10:45.043
and all that kind of stuff,

10:45.045 --> 10:46.277
and you gotta get
her approval, right?

10:46.279 --> 10:47.846
Yeah.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.382
Well, it's not
that way in college.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.683
College is different.

10:53.053 --> 10:57.222
Now, I'm not tellin' you
to disobey your mama,

10:57.224 --> 10:58.790
but I am tellin' you that

10:59.893 --> 11:02.093
there comes a time
in a man's life

11:02.095 --> 11:05.296
when he's gotta
decide for himself.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.001
It's somethin' to think about.

11:10.003 --> 11:10.902
Yeah.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.871
Hey, you remember this?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.206
I remember that.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.241
I remember all this.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.075
[Benny] Ninth grade.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.109
Yeah.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.077
Yeah.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.679
So.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.814
Work it out with your mama.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.182
It's gonna be all right.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.350
You come in here
anytime you want.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.785
You're kickin' ass this season.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.153
- Thanks, coach.
- I'm proud of you, son.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.187
Yes, sir.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.773
Thanks for everything.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.358
I'll see you at practice.
I'll see you at practice.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.312
(whistle tweeting)

12:12.866 --> 12:14.232
- Hey, mom.
- Finally.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.767
[Benny] Sorry I'm late.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.302
Those coaches know they
are not supposed to keep you

12:17.304 --> 12:18.369
past six o'clock.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.105
Practice ended at six.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.740
We just had team meetings
and stuff after, you know.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.474
Oh.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.942
Team meetings sounds like

12:23.944 --> 12:25.504
screwing around with
your friends to me.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.146
Thank you for grabbin'
all those groceries.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.782
[Benny] You're welcome.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.016
[Theresa] So how
was your meeting

12:32.018 --> 12:32.851
with the college advisor?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.120
Fine, fine, all right.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.858
What did he say
about your essay?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.860
He said I need to write
about somethin' else.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.194
[Theresa]
So the two of you sat

12:43.196 --> 12:44.462
and brainstormed
some more ideas?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.464
[Benny] Kinda.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.201
Don't tell me you were
doin' football at lunch.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.839
Ma, so I went to
Coach Vick's office,

12:54.841 --> 12:56.407
and he told me he can
get me into college

12:56.409 --> 12:58.376
and with a full scholarship.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.111
Wow.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.179
[Benny] That's good news.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.480
Mm-hm.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.249
And when did he say
he would do this?

13:04.251 --> 13:05.483
Well, he didn't really say,

13:05.485 --> 13:07.185
but it's somethin'
he's workin' on.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.253
Oh, but he's sure about it?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.287
[Benny] Yeah, he's sure.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.822
I trust him.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.356
Well, if you trust
him, then, Benny.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.227
Why aren't you happy about this?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.098
Honey, you can't
rely on other people

13:20.100 --> 13:21.432
to help you get through life.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.503
Ma, I'm not relying on Coach
Vick to get me through life.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.338
Everyone that I
have ever worked with

13:27.340 --> 13:30.041
is a liar until they
put it on paper.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.342
And even then,

13:31.344 --> 13:33.304
sometimes they're still
tryin' to get over on you.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.881
I mean, did he say what
he wanted in return?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.050
Oh.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.052
Great.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.354
So you just went out there and
wrote that man a blank check.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.557
No, I didn't write
him no blank check.

13:45.559 --> 13:48.393
Boy, you are just another
pawn in his winning streak.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.267
Look, honey, I'm sorry.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.335
Okay?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.537
I just don't want
you to get stuck

13:59.539 --> 14:02.073
doing something that
you don't even like.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.310
Ma,

14:07.113 --> 14:08.446
I like playing football.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.516
And I'm doin' this.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.555
I love you.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.297
I love you too.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.445
(door closing)

14:41.448 --> 14:42.448
What's funny?

14:45.352 --> 14:46.351
I'm just taking my time.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.419
We ain't got much time, Mark.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.555
And coach won't be
happy if you're late.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.523
What's he gonna do, take
away playing time I don't get?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.092
Don't screw us over.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.660
If you're late, we could
all take the heat for it.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.495
But coach is not gonna
make us run sprints

14:57.497 --> 14:59.030
three days before the
biggest game of the season.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.966
Mark, you still
should just get movin'.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.969
Benny, do you do everything
Coach Vick tells you to do?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.990
What time you got?

15:28.561 --> 15:29.994
[Greg] 3:02 exactly.

15:29.996 --> 15:30.995
[Vick] That's what I got.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.497
3:02 exactly.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.365
They're not all here.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.468
Think that English teacher
Crossley kept them late?

15:37.470 --> 15:38.536
[Vick] I hope so.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.104
That better be the reason.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.407
[Greg] I'll go
find out who it is.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.441
[Vick] All right.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.443
[Greg] Atta boy.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.645
[Benny] Bein' late's
one thing, fellas,

15:47.647 --> 15:49.347
but we should get movin'.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.549
[Mark] Okay, look, you wanna
run all the way to the field,

15:51.551 --> 15:52.183
be my guest.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.685
Anybody?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.186
Aw, man, I just got a
bad feelin' about this.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.304
Shut up!

15:56.305 --> 15:57.421
Stop tellin' me to shut up!

15:57.424 --> 15:58.390
What's your problem?

15:58.391 --> 15:59.391
All right, man!

16:05.498 --> 16:06.431
[Player] Feel better?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.599
[Benny] Damn straight, man.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.303
Asshole.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.442
[Player] Crap.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.026
11 minutes late.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.596
I give you guys a full half-hour

16:38.598 --> 16:41.265
to get from the school
to the locker room,

16:41.267 --> 16:43.134
and you still can't do it.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.538
One of's you late, same
as all y'all bein' late.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.309
The weakest link can break us.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.678
And I'm not gonna
see us get broken

16:53.680 --> 16:56.381
after all that
we've been through.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.449
So I'm gonna put a
stop to it right now.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.718
11 minutes.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.553
11 gassers.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.288
Right now.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.290
On me.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.160
(whistle tweeting)

17:09.162 --> 17:11.695
This is gonna wreck
'em for Friday's game.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.798
[Vick] We'll stop at 11.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.434
We can't be on time,
we got nothin'.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.769
[Greg] I think the
season's doin' fine.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.537
I don't care what you think.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.209
(whistle tweeting)

17:26.512 --> 17:28.396
(whistle tweeting)

17:28.396 --> 17:30.280
[Greg] Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.618
(whistle tweeting)

17:33.620 --> 17:36.220
(whistle tweeting)

17:36.222 --> 17:38.456
[Vick] Get the lead
out, it's fourth quarter.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.607
It's fourth quarter,

17:39.608 --> 17:40.757
you gonna give up in
the fourth quarter?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.827
If you do, you're not
gonna win the game.

17:42.829 --> 17:43.828
Chaz, move it.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.329
Let's go!

17:45.331 --> 17:47.065
I didn't see anybody puke yet.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.067
Let's go!

17:55.275 --> 17:57.508
(vomits)

17:57.510 --> 17:59.710
(claps)

18:06.119 --> 18:07.285
(Vick claps)

18:07.287 --> 18:08.287
One more.

18:10.356 --> 18:14.092
(whistle tweeting)

18:14.094 --> 18:15.426
[Mark] That was 11!

18:15.428 --> 18:16.427
[Vick] What?

18:16.428 --> 18:17.427
[Mark] That was 11, I counted!

18:17.430 --> 18:18.196
[Vick] One more!

18:18.198 --> 18:19.464
[Mark] We're done!

18:19.465 --> 18:20.731
You gonna run with
the rest of the team,

18:20.733 --> 18:22.800
or you're not gonna be
a part of this team.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.843
[Greg] All right,
boys, hit the showers.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.762
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, coach.

18:33.763 --> 18:35.680
We're gonna keep runnin'
till everybody runs their 11.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.814
I did already.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.484
Everybody runs 11.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.086
You better get
him runnin', boys!

18:41.087 --> 18:42.687
[Player] Come on,
Mark, let's do this.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.721
I'm done.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.189
You're not done, man.

18:45.190 --> 18:46.656
He wants everyone, come on.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.292
Let's go.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.393
[Player] Let's
do this, all right?

18:49.395 --> 18:51.295
- Come on.
- All right, damn!

18:51.297 --> 18:52.830
This is a lot right now, Vick.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.899
[Vick] It's the only way
we're gonna get discipline.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.981
It's the only way we're
gonna win this football game.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.738
(whistle tweeting)

19:04.844 --> 19:05.710
Get the lead out!

19:05.712 --> 19:06.711
Atta boy.

19:06.712 --> 19:07.711
- Come on, Turner.
- Atta boy.

19:07.714 --> 19:08.714
[Greg] Come on, Turner!

19:12.385 --> 19:16.387
(players panting and grunting)

19:21.161 --> 19:22.860
Yo, Benny, come on.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.428
Here, I got you, bro.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.430
Here, come on.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.666
Hey.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.501
Coach!

19:30.503 --> 19:31.936
Come on.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.604
Coach!

19:33.606 --> 19:34.606
Coach!

19:35.475 --> 19:36.475
Coach!

19:40.713 --> 19:41.646
[Vick] What the hell?

19:41.648 --> 19:42.680
Get Duffy now, get Duffy now!

19:42.682 --> 19:43.915
[Greg] I don't
think we need Duffy.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.250
I think we need the paramedics.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.819
(crow cawing)

19:55.728 --> 19:57.728
(ambulance engine starting)

19:57.730 --> 20:00.565
(siren blipping)

20:08.741 --> 20:11.676
(Theresa cries)

20:14.480 --> 20:15.880
Hey, is he gonna be okay?

20:17.784 --> 20:19.417
I don't think so.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.785
How do you know?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.621
[Ford] They didn't
turn on the sirens.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.724
What have you done?

20:28.962 --> 20:30.928
Stay away from me.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.863
He's all I had left.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.800
Why?

20:36.603 --> 20:38.436
His blood is on your hands.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.772
(cries)

20:50.483 --> 20:52.984
(clears throat)

20:57.790 --> 20:59.890
Benny had somethin'
wrong with his heart.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.893
He's gone, boys.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.800
Practice for the rest of
the week's gonna be canceled.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.504
We're gonna reschedule
Friday's game.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.608
Go home.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.710
Everybody go home.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.426
(Vick cries)

21:54.447 --> 21:55.880
[Male Reporter] Heart
disease must continue.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.315
[Female Reporter]
Tragedy this week

21:57.317 --> 21:58.983
as local football
player Benny Robinson

21:58.985 --> 22:01.352
died suddenly on
the practice field.

22:01.354 --> 22:04.488
A caring, a thoughtful,
a wonderful human being,

22:04.490 --> 22:06.957
they are going to
miss him greatly.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.826
We're also being told
that Benny Robinson

22:08.828 --> 22:11.329
had a rare heart condition.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.930
We'll be finding
out more about that

22:12.932 --> 22:15.900
as the autopsy happens
in a little bit.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.702
We're here live
at Saints Stadium.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.071
We will have more on
this story tonight at 10.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.948
(country music)

22:40.026 --> 22:41.492
Coach.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.494
[Vick] Ted.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.396
We all just heard about it.

22:45.398 --> 22:48.432
People are comin' in
nonstop talkin' about it.

22:48.434 --> 22:49.684
Yeah.

22:49.685 --> 22:50.935
But we are literally
sick to our stomachs.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.371
I just never thought
something like this'd happen.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.507
What can I get you?

22:56.576 --> 22:57.875
A double.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.794
You're a good man.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.875
I don't think I could handle
anything under a triple.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.447
Okay.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.482
Do that.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.616
You got it.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.092
Tonight's on the house.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.027
Thanks, Ted.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.402
- Hello?
- Hey, Vick.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.003
This is Coach Brown
from the Lions.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.605
Oh, hey!

23:28.741 --> 23:30.474
[Brown] I gotta
apologize to you.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.042
Our bye week was last week,

23:32.044 --> 23:34.612
and there's just no
way we can reschedule.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.113
Well, we have to.

23:36.115 --> 23:39.717
[Brown] I cannot imagine
what you are goin' through.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.052
You have my deepest condolences.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.054
Thank you.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.060
Dammit.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.732
The usual, bartender.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.068
Well,

23:58.070 --> 23:59.603
what do you say?

23:59.605 --> 24:01.972
Big-time football
coach in my bar.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.209
Yeah.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.481
Heard about that kid.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.884
Damn shame.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.221
It is.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.522
Heard it was your fault.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.561
[Vick] Who said that crap?

24:23.563 --> 24:26.063
Just everybody I
been seein' tonight.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.932
The whole town's buzzin'.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.533
It was his heart.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.769
It's just what I was hearin'.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.205
It's not like I was hearin'
you was gonna win on Friday.

24:34.207 --> 24:37.007
Game's off, Billy.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.876
You ain't even gonna try.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.013
[Greg] Come on,
you can't be serious.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.081
[Vick] We don't have a choice.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.516
[Greg] It's a game.

24:45.517 --> 24:46.950
It's one game.
It is not your call to make.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.652
Coach, just wait a second.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.587
I am begging you right now.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.121
Do not do this.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.691
You have the team here,
ready to play, Friday night.

24:53.693 --> 24:54.525
Why, though?

24:54.527 --> 24:55.626
Why? Is it that scout?

24:55.628 --> 24:56.627
Is that what this is about?

24:56.629 --> 24:57.695
We're playin'.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.829
Coach.

24:58.831 --> 24:59.964
Come on.

24:59.966 --> 25:03.167

25:03.169 --> 25:08.239

25:09.809 --> 25:14.879

25:53.185 --> 25:54.118
- Saints!
- Win!

25:54.120 --> 25:55.152
- Saints!
- Win!

25:57.790 --> 25:59.256
This is for Benny.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.569
Right into your belly.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.038
And just, I'll keep
the leg moving.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.005
See, there's always drops.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.006
[Greg] Lower to the gut.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.975
There's always drops.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.314
What's the superintendent
doin' here?

26:23.316 --> 26:26.116
Greg, what is the
superintendent doin' here?

26:27.019 --> 26:28.218
What the hell's
goin' on, Wesley?

26:28.220 --> 26:30.154
Coach, I need
you to turn around.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.989
Oh, why would I do that?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.157
The game's canceled.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.059
Saints forfeited.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.260
(players protesting)

26:36.262 --> 26:37.127
Hey, hey, hey.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.796
We're ready to play.

26:38.798 --> 26:42.032
Victor, please take your
team back to the locker room.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.201
I'm not takin' my team
back to the locker room.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.136
We're playin' this game, Wesley.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.638
It's done.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.672
Greg made the call.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.343
[Vick] It's not
his call to make.

26:52.345 --> 26:53.811
It's my call to make.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.079
It was the wrong call.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.218
Boy.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.252
Let's go, let's go.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.354
- Come on, coach...
- Let's go!

27:03.356 --> 27:04.855
Turn around, let's go.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.657
It was the right
thing to do, Greg.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.144
Get in there, get in there.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.312
Get in there.

27:31.217 --> 27:32.750
Tom.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.084
Vick.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.154
What's the deal?

27:37.155 --> 27:38.087
I had nothin' to do with this.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.357
It all amounts
to the same thing.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.359
So that's it?

27:44.263 --> 27:48.265
Look, man, I guess I'll come
out for a championship game.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.267
At least I can trust y'all

27:50.269 --> 27:52.202
not to forfeit
somethin' like that.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.108
(car starting)

28:03.716 --> 28:05.182
[Radio Show Host] We
got some breaking news.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.451
Coach Vick and the Saints
kicked off the field.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.419
What do you think?

28:08.421 --> 28:11.255
[Sportscaster] Well,
we all know Coach Vick.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.190
He's very competitive, he's
tryin' to make it to state.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.758
He's in a tight spot right now.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.326
I think he was right
in tryin' to play.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.696
He has a commitment to
his team, to the town.

28:18.698 --> 28:21.131
I think his player would
have wanted him to play.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.933
We'll see what happens
the next coming weeks.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.302
[Radio Show Host] Well,
whatever the right decision was,

28:25.304 --> 28:27.337
he's got a storm comin' his way.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.739
Hope he rides it out.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.846
[Wendy] And there he is.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.147
That'll be all, Wendy.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.149
Thank you.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.818
Victor.

28:40.820 --> 28:41.820
Come in.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.257
Do you recognize her?

28:47.259 --> 28:50.027
That's Wendy Maine, the
reporter you see all over TV.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.446
She's had me cornered
in this office,

28:52.447 --> 28:54.864
asking for a comment about the
death on your team this week.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.200
And?

28:56.202 --> 28:58.435
[Wesley] You turned this
whole thing into a circus.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.272
It was a freak accident.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.841
What was I supposed to do?

29:03.843 --> 29:05.275
Maybe not forcing
the team to play

29:05.277 --> 29:07.010
before they could bury
their friend, for starters?

29:07.012 --> 29:09.847
Oh, so am I here
for you to tell me

29:09.849 --> 29:11.248
how to coach a football team,

29:11.250 --> 29:14.151
or can I just go
ahead and leave?

29:14.153 --> 29:15.519
I think you need
to be more concerned

29:15.521 --> 29:17.287
about your future
employment, Victor.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.190
You can't fire me.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.864
I can find room in the
budget for counselors.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.399
I can't say the same thing for
attorneys and a settlement.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.269
You're a spineless
son of a bitch.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.007
You're suspended!

29:37.008 --> 29:38.007
I can't fire you without
a school board vote,

29:38.010 --> 29:41.145
but I can tell you what
that vote's gonna be.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.886
[Vick] Pitiful.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.857
(car engine running)

30:01.934 --> 30:04.902
(car door closing)

30:07.273 --> 30:08.405
Coach Trenton.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.506
[Vick] Not anymore.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.842
[Theresa] This is for you.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.310
I had to deliver it by hand.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.383
You're suin' me?

30:21.053 --> 30:23.387
This is how you
mourn Benny's death?

30:23.389 --> 30:25.455
This shit isn't my fault.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.293
Benny had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy,

30:29.295 --> 30:31.094
a condition that
doesn't kill anyone

30:31.096 --> 30:34.464
unless they're immense
physical stress.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.867
He's gone because you
pushed him too hard.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.404
I suggest you get a lawyer.

30:40.406 --> 30:43.006
I don't need a lawyer.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.408
I know what happened.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.413
Ma'am.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.282
Please.

30:54.887 --> 30:55.986
When is his funeral?

30:57.456 --> 30:59.489
You're not welcome there.

31:13.873 --> 31:16.540
(door closing)

31:38.998 --> 31:41.064

31:48.374 --> 31:50.507

32:23.409 --> 32:26.143
I know things are tough
for you right now.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.145
I'm just

32:29.315 --> 32:31.281

shut everybody out.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.530
Well, I'm gonna
close it up, Vick.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.198
Of course, you can
always come back in

32:48.200 --> 32:50.434
tomorrow afternoon at
opening, if you'd like.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.501
(laughs)

32:51.503 --> 32:53.270
Maybe I will.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.038
What are folks sayin', Ted?

32:56.675 --> 32:59.242
Oh, uh,

32:59.244 --> 33:00.644
well, you know folks.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.180
Always sayin' some
sort of thing.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.615
Yeah, what kind of things?

33:07.453 --> 33:09.186
I meant to ask you,

33:09.188 --> 33:12.055
are you gonna say a few
words at that boy's service?

33:12.057 --> 33:13.090
I don't think so.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.559
His mother doesn't
want me there.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.062
Well.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.399
If that changes, it might help.

33:22.401 --> 33:23.401
Maybe.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.037
Goodnight, Vick.

33:27.039 --> 33:28.039
[Vick] Goodnight.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.340
[Turner] Guys, just face it.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.708
Like, the season's over.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.895
[Ford] Come on,
man, don't say that.

33:34.896 --> 33:36.613
No, seriously, like Benny
was freakin' amazing, man.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.749
Everything just sucks
now, and coach is gone.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.051
I'm pretty sure Mark

33:41.053 --> 33:42.973
and a bunch of the other
guys are gonna quit too.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.691
Coach wants to know where
the funeral's gonna be.

33:49.762 --> 33:51.228
Are you gonna tell him?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.696
Hell yeah.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.064
Shouldn't he be there?

are you doing here?

34:37.576 --> 34:39.842
I'm just here to
pay my respects.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.313
I made it clear that
you are not welcome here.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.650
I really need
closure on this, ma'am.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.388
That is a luxury
that I will never have.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.791
And I don't plan to let you
have it anytime soon either.

35:10.642 --> 35:11.741
- Hey, coach.
- Oh, hey, coach.

35:11.743 --> 35:12.743
[Vick] Hey, guys.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.800
[Ford] You're not staying?

35:17.483 --> 35:18.927
I can't.

35:18.928 --> 35:20.372
Thanks for tellin' me about it.

35:20.373 --> 35:21.817
You know, coach, I think it's
some crap you got suspended.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.421
You guys just keep
playing your asses off and

35:26.158 --> 35:27.757
pray for Benny,

35:27.759 --> 35:28.759
and everybody,

35:30.329 --> 35:31.261
and I'll be your coach again

35:31.263 --> 35:32.629
as soon as all this crap's over.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.730
- Go get 'em.
- All right.

35:33.732 --> 35:34.698
Thanks, coach.

35:34.700 --> 35:35.732
[Vick] Yeah.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.772
(car door closing)

35:43.609 --> 35:44.641
Hey, Coach Vick!

35:44.643 --> 35:45.609
Oh, Christ.

35:45.611 --> 35:46.611
How's it goin'?

35:47.913 --> 35:50.147
It's not too great, Drew.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.549
I just wanted to see if
Mark's reached out to you.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.785
I haven't seen him.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.721
Well, he wasn't here, actually.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.724
He's been at home
since Friday night.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.759
He's pretty messed
up over all this.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.494
I don't know how to help him.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.465
Well, you're his dad.

36:10.469 --> 36:11.151
Figure it out.

36:11.152 --> 36:11.834
I don't know what to do, Vick.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.703
He won't tell me anything.

36:13.705 --> 36:14.804
I mean,

36:15.674 --> 36:17.340
what happened on that field?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.846
The superintendent told
me that he was gonna be

36:22.848 --> 36:24.848
hiring some grief
counselors for the school

36:24.850 --> 36:27.651
to help with the players
and the teachers and stuff,

36:27.653 --> 36:31.922
and so if you could get Mark
to go talk to one of them,

36:31.924 --> 36:35.892
I'm sure that'll help, and
he'll be much better off.

36:35.894 --> 36:36.894
All right?

36:37.696 --> 36:38.795
We'll see ya.

36:44.803 --> 36:45.803
Hey.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.572
Jesus, Vick.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.607
I was only half kiddin' about
you comin' back at opening.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.609
I think it's time
for another triple.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.446
All right, head on in.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.722
Wouldn't even let you stay?

37:05.724 --> 37:06.890
It's ridiculous.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.392
What's next?

37:10.929 --> 37:13.763
Well, the Auburn scout
says I gotta win state

37:13.765 --> 37:15.398
to have a shot.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.900
We can still win with one loss,

37:16.902 --> 37:21.438
but the school board's decidin'
whether I get to come back.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.440
Maybe it'll help
if you win the case.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.442
Maybe.

37:32.718 --> 37:33.950
I was at the funeral.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.688
I didn't see you there.

37:40.859 --> 37:45.829
You shoulda heard the folks
talkin' after the service,

37:45.831 --> 37:48.365
whisperin' about the head coach,

37:49.468 --> 37:52.469
how he done run the
boy in the ground.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.670
He done it.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.772
He's guilty as sin.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.007
It wasn't my fault.

37:57.009 --> 37:58.375
Vick.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.476
(laughs)

37:59.477 --> 38:00.576
It wasn't my fault!
(glass shattering)

38:00.579 --> 38:01.278
Hey!

38:01.280 --> 38:02.062
Cool it!

38:02.063 --> 38:02.845
[Vick] Get off me, Ted.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.398
You gotta go.

38:04.399 --> 38:05.949
Bartender, you
think he's innocent?

38:07.786 --> 38:09.819
What do you think?

38:09.821 --> 38:11.071
You gotta go, Vick.

38:11.072 --> 38:12.322
I don't want any trouble
around here, okay?

38:12.324 --> 38:13.924
You think it was my fault!

38:13.925 --> 38:15.525
I think that I've never
seen you like this, okay?

38:15.527 --> 38:17.694
Just go home and
get some rest, okay?

38:22.834 --> 38:23.834
Thanks, asshole.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.875
(grunts)

38:32.811 --> 38:34.744
Christ Almighty.

38:34.746 --> 38:35.829
Yeah.

38:35.830 --> 38:36.913
[Sara] You've been
ignoring my messages.

38:36.915 --> 38:37.948
Huh.

38:37.949 --> 38:38.982
[Sara] I'm worried
about you, dad.

38:38.984 --> 38:39.916
Really.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.351
[Sara] Yeah.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.819
I feel on top of it, all right?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.587
[Sara] How could you
possibly be on top of it?

38:44.589 --> 38:46.790
I'm not here to cry about it.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.091
It's not gonna do any good.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.526
[Sara] Oh my God, you're trying

38:49.528 --> 38:51.094
to win something
that can't be won.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.029
You have to turn
this around, dad.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.764
Oh, thank you, coach.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.966
What do I do after halftime,
why don't you tell me that?

38:56.968 --> 39:00.870
Fine, Vick... (phone beeping)

39:00.872 --> 39:03.807
(alarm beeping)

39:05.110 --> 39:07.911
(moderate music)

39:33.372 --> 39:36.539
(newspaper rustling)

39:50.055 --> 39:51.055
Dammit.

40:01.433 --> 40:05.602
In the 1960s, as many as
26 high school players died

40:05.604 --> 40:08.671
in one year during
football practice.

40:08.673 --> 40:12.709
Even with our modern
technology, updated safety gear,

40:12.711 --> 40:16.880
we still average eight
to 16 players a year

40:16.882 --> 40:20.049
dead each year nationwide.

40:20.051 --> 40:24.087
That means there's a one in
100,000 chance that a player

40:24.089 --> 40:27.123
will die during his playing
of high school football.

40:28.193 --> 40:32.629
Just think about car
wrecks, addiction, alcohol,

40:32.631 --> 40:33.963
think about those numbers.

40:33.965 --> 40:34.998
Way higher.

40:36.535 --> 40:41.070
Of all youth sports, one
player dies every three days.

40:42.674 --> 40:45.875
Does that mean that one in
100,000 football coaches

40:45.877 --> 40:47.777
should be tried for murder?

40:48.780 --> 40:50.146
I don't think so.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.018
What happened to Benny
was a freak accident.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.021
An accident.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.457
We should simply
have more awareness

41:00.459 --> 41:01.858
of why these things happen.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.996
You gonna write
any of that down?

41:10.502 --> 41:12.902
Do you feel that crashing
the player's funeral

41:12.904 --> 41:15.672
was inappropriate in any way?

41:17.142 --> 41:18.475
His mother was
under the impression

41:18.477 --> 41:20.176
that this was not an accident,

41:20.178 --> 41:23.813
and that's why she's bringing
a lawsuit against me.

41:23.815 --> 41:27.083
So you blame the
mother of the deceased.

41:27.085 --> 41:28.085
Yes.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.587
No.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.021
Yes?

41:32.023 --> 41:33.656
No?

41:33.658 --> 41:34.658
Care to clarify?

41:36.695 --> 41:39.062
She just shoulda known
about his heart problem.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.264
So you don't feel that any
of this is your responsibility.

41:41.266 --> 41:45.869
When I get rid of
this ridiculous lawsuit,

41:45.871 --> 41:48.204
then everybody
will see the truth.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.973
The administration
will see the truth,

41:49.975 --> 41:52.025
the people will see the truth,

41:52.026 --> 41:54.076
and hopefully you see
the truth right now.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.245
Let me get this straight.

41:57.682 --> 42:00.817
A player dies from
physical stress

42:00.819 --> 42:03.052
because of your
punishment sprints,

42:03.054 --> 42:06.155
only to ruin the mother
in a court of law.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.190
No!

42:07.192 --> 42:08.224
That's not it at all!

42:10.028 --> 42:11.661
I'm gonna have my photographer

42:11.663 --> 42:14.197
take some shots for the
piece, if you don't mind.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.666
Thank you for your time, Victor.

42:16.668 --> 42:19.669
(discordant music)

42:21.873 --> 42:25.174
(bicycle bell ringing)

42:32.784 --> 42:35.151
(dog barking)

42:52.170 --> 42:53.736
[Vick] Dammit!

42:59.311 --> 43:02.245
(phone ringing)

43:09.154 --> 43:10.820
[Wesley] What the hell
do you think you're doing,

43:10.822 --> 43:11.921
going to the press?

43:11.923 --> 43:13.256
Wendy Maine, of all people?

43:13.258 --> 43:14.190
You stupid...

43:14.192 --> 43:17.860
(phone receiver banging)

43:18.897 --> 43:20.630
[Announcer] The
Saints score a touchdown

43:20.632 --> 43:21.731
right off the bat.

43:21.733 --> 43:23.366
This team is on fire!

43:24.970 --> 43:28.104
The 20, the 10, the five,
and he's in the end zone!

43:28.106 --> 43:31.240
The Saints are going to
beat the defending champs!

43:31.242 --> 43:34.210
What a night it has
been for the Saints

43:34.212 --> 43:37.647
under their new head
coach, Mr. Greg Reid.

43:37.649 --> 43:40.049
The rest of this
season is looking good.

43:41.686 --> 43:42.686
Cheers.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.321
(slurps)

43:47.726 --> 43:49.225
In cases like this,

43:49.227 --> 43:51.861
it is recommended that you
both seek legal counsel.

43:53.098 --> 43:57.166
But both of you have decided
to represent yourselves pro se.

43:57.168 --> 43:59.936
It is unconventional,
but it is legal.

43:59.938 --> 44:02.138
You both waived a jury as well,

44:02.140 --> 44:04.240
so you'll present
your case to me.

44:04.242 --> 44:07.143
You'll question your
witnesses in front of me.

44:07.145 --> 44:10.079
You will talk to each other
as you normally would.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.748
Are there any questions?

44:11.750 --> 44:12.815
- No, your honor.
- No.

44:13.752 --> 44:14.384
Your honor.

44:14.386 --> 44:16.152
(gavel banging)

44:16.154 --> 44:18.221
Calling to order the case
of Robinson versus Trenton.

44:18.223 --> 44:19.822
The plaintiff, Miss Robinson,

44:19.824 --> 44:21.758
sues in the amount of $1.

44:23.361 --> 44:25.928
My son was a
hardworking young man

44:25.930 --> 44:30.066
who kept his nose to the
grindstone his whole life.

44:30.068 --> 44:34.704
He had friends, he had family,
he had a bright future.

44:35.774 --> 44:39.175
He also had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy,

44:39.177 --> 44:41.110
a condition that we would
have never known about,

44:41.112 --> 44:44.313
had it not been for Coach
Trenton's revenge sprints

44:44.315 --> 44:45.314
- that unfairly...
- I object!

44:45.316 --> 44:46.249
These are not...

44:46.251 --> 44:47.316
[Judge] Mr. Trenton, please.

44:47.318 --> 44:48.151
Please.

44:48.153 --> 44:49.318
[Vick] Okay.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.170
You've been advised
there is no jury

44:51.171 --> 44:53.021
and you're free to speak
as you normally would.

44:53.024 --> 44:54.924
There's no need to
formally object.

44:54.926 --> 44:56.259
Oh.

44:56.261 --> 44:57.727
Okay.

44:57.729 --> 44:58.729
But

44:59.297 --> 45:01.230
that's not fair, right?

45:01.232 --> 45:04.133
You're right, it was
an unfair assumption.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.035
Now, Miss Robinson,
you may continue

45:06.037 --> 45:09.305
without the objectionable
material this time.

45:09.307 --> 45:11.708
This man is at fault
for the death of my son.

45:13.011 --> 45:15.812
I could sue him for a
dollar or a million dollars.

45:15.814 --> 45:17.180
It wouldn't matter to me.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.316
Because when he loses this case,

45:21.853 --> 45:23.419
he'll never hurt anyone again.

45:24.355 --> 45:27.056
Because he'll never coach again.

45:28.293 --> 45:30.993
And he'll finally understand
what it feels like

45:30.995 --> 45:32.895
to lose something that he loves.

45:35.467 --> 45:38.167
[Judge] Does the defendant
have an opening statement?

45:39.370 --> 45:43.306
Benny's loss has been
absolutely tragic for me too.

45:43.308 --> 45:44.907
I never thought
anything in the world

45:44.909 --> 45:46.142
like this could happen.

45:47.378 --> 45:50.313
Did you ever even come
to one of his games?

45:50.315 --> 45:53.116
Your honor, I would like
to call my first witness.

45:53.118 --> 45:54.350
Please do, Miss Robinson.

45:56.321 --> 45:58.488
Would you say
that you've ever had

45:58.490 --> 46:00.790
a practice entirely of sprints?

46:01.459 --> 46:02.959
No, ma'am.

46:02.961 --> 46:04.460
So what was the reason
for them this day?

46:04.462 --> 46:07.230
'Cause me and three of
the other guys were late.

46:07.232 --> 46:09.265
So this was a
form of punishment.

46:10.435 --> 46:11.435
Yes, ma'am.

46:12.470 --> 46:14.437
Was Benny one of
those other guys?

46:15.240 --> 46:16.139
Yes, ma'am.

46:16.141 --> 46:20.209
Your honor, while the sprints
were a form of punishment,

46:20.211 --> 46:23.146
I argue that they were increased
beyond the normal level

46:23.148 --> 46:25.414
due to the aggression
of the defendant

46:25.416 --> 46:29.285
and only at this stage
were they deemed harmful.

46:29.287 --> 46:30.853
[Judge] Duly noted.

46:30.855 --> 46:32.255
That's the problem these days.

46:32.257 --> 46:34.223
It's discipline,

46:34.225 --> 46:35.958
not aggression.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.260
Life is all about discipline.

46:37.262 --> 46:38.427
You know that, judge.

46:39.230 --> 46:40.830
A kid should respect it.

46:40.832 --> 46:42.565
And when I get a player
that comes in there

46:42.567 --> 46:46.202
who hadn't been taught any
discipline by his parents,

46:47.338 --> 46:49.405
the only way I'm gonna
get respect out of him

46:49.407 --> 46:51.340
is with law and order.

46:51.342 --> 46:53.309
Yeah, you tell 'em, coach.

46:53.311 --> 46:57.346
Mr. Trenton, you do realize
that you're not their parent?

46:57.348 --> 46:59.081
Nor are you a police officer?

47:00.418 --> 47:02.351
You're a high school
football coach.

47:07.292 --> 47:09.959
If Mr. Trenton felt that
he was being challenged

47:09.961 --> 47:13.296
by insubordination
from his players,

47:13.298 --> 47:15.565
would that be something
that he could just

47:15.567 --> 47:16.933
forget about?

47:18.570 --> 47:21.571
Um, he would stamp it out.

47:21.573 --> 47:23.406
At the cost of their well being?

47:23.408 --> 47:25.925
Give it a rest.

47:25.926 --> 47:28.443
You think I'd let somebody die
just to win a football game?

47:30.415 --> 47:31.415
Tell 'em, Greg.

47:32.483 --> 47:33.883
You've worked with me for years.

47:33.884 --> 47:35.284
Tell 'em how I feel
about the team.

47:35.286 --> 47:36.485
Go ahead, tell 'em.

47:36.487 --> 47:38.187
Well, I mean, you'd
go for a touchdown

47:38.189 --> 47:39.555
rather than kick a field goal.

47:41.593 --> 47:43.960
But this was a level
I hadn't seen before.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.495
Did you observe the
player in question

47:46.497 --> 47:48.364
struggling with these sprints?

47:48.366 --> 47:51.567
Yeah, but it wasn't
out of the ordinary

47:51.569 --> 47:52.602
after that much runnin'.

47:52.604 --> 47:54.303
[Vick] That's right.

47:54.305 --> 47:56.873
[Judge] And did you feel
the sprints were excessive?

47:56.875 --> 47:59.508
I felt they were
excessive for a game week.

47:59.510 --> 48:02.178
[Judge] Did you express
this concern to Mr. Trenton?

48:02.180 --> 48:03.379
[Greg] Yes.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.740
[Theresa] And
how did he respond?

48:05.984 --> 48:06.984
Um,

48:08.920 --> 48:09.920
he ignored me.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.056
How long thereafter
did Benny collapse?

48:15.326 --> 48:16.959
It was the next gasser.

48:16.961 --> 48:17.894
Really?

48:17.896 --> 48:19.128
[Vick] That was the last one.

48:19.130 --> 48:20.162
[Theresa] You can't prove that.

48:20.164 --> 48:21.364
Yes, I can.

48:21.366 --> 48:23.466
That was the last
one, I told you that.

48:23.468 --> 48:26.002
I don't remember
you sayin' that.

48:26.004 --> 48:27.153
[Theresa] Your honor,

48:27.154 --> 48:28.634
I would like to call
one last witness.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.974
[Judge] You're excused.

48:31.976 --> 48:33.509
Sir, you're excused.

48:38.983 --> 48:41.384
[Theresa] Did you end
up running 11 gassers?

48:41.386 --> 48:42.551
[Mark] Yes.

48:42.553 --> 48:45.821
[Theresa] What happened then?

48:45.822 --> 48:49.090
I stopped because I counted,
and I said that that was 11,

48:50.361 --> 48:53.062
and we kept going,
'cause coach didn't care.

48:53.064 --> 48:54.563
Why did he keep them going?

48:57.135 --> 48:58.968
'Cause he wanted me to give in.

48:58.970 --> 48:59.970
[Theresa] Did you?

49:01.673 --> 49:03.139
No.

49:03.141 --> 49:05.608
So if you were the
insubordinate party,

49:05.610 --> 49:08.544
why did the entire team
have to run sprints?

49:09.347 --> 49:11.227
'Cause he'll do anything
to get what he wants.

49:13.718 --> 49:15.618
Even at the cost
of an innocent life?

49:15.620 --> 49:18.587
(discordant music)

49:24.128 --> 49:25.128
Um,

49:26.064 --> 49:27.064
yes.

49:28.099 --> 49:29.165
[Theresa] No further
questions, your honor.

49:29.167 --> 49:30.167
Plaintiff rests.

49:31.602 --> 49:32.635
You're excused.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.639
I don't feel any better.

49:36.641 --> 49:38.574
You said that this
would help me.

49:38.576 --> 49:40.242
You did great, honey.

49:40.244 --> 49:41.577
But you have to go now, okay?

49:41.579 --> 49:42.478
You're excused.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.647
I'm not ready yet.

49:44.649 --> 49:45.481
I don't think that I,

49:45.483 --> 49:46.315
I could say more.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.317
I didn't say enough.

49:48.152 --> 49:49.485
We'll talk in a minute.

49:52.056 --> 49:53.056
Thank you.

49:56.461 --> 49:57.994
Contrary to what I advised,

49:57.996 --> 49:59.395
both of you have
expressed the need

49:59.397 --> 50:01.430
for an immediate decision

50:01.432 --> 50:03.632
despite of a lack of
reflection on my part.

50:04.569 --> 50:07.670
So we shall reconvene
after a short recess.

50:08.539 --> 50:11.273
(gavel banging)

50:15.279 --> 50:16.279
Hey.

50:17.648 --> 50:20.716
Why don't you believe me when
I say I cared about Benny?

50:22.286 --> 50:24.620
Because you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

50:26.124 --> 50:29.358
When Benny's father left,
I had to be both parents.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.660
I paid the bills,
I ran the house,

50:32.497 --> 50:34.530
I raised him to have a future.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.565
And when you invest that
much time into a child,

50:36.567 --> 50:38.701
you know when they're
falling behind.

50:40.038 --> 50:44.140
You watch them, protect them.

50:44.142 --> 50:47.376
You don't keep blowing a damn
whistle until they drop dead.

50:49.447 --> 50:52.248
So it's just revenge, huh?

50:52.250 --> 50:54.683
He kept spending more and
more time with the team.

50:56.254 --> 50:59.055
I raised him just so he
could come home after dark,

50:59.057 --> 51:02.091
exhausted, and then
wake up the next day

51:02.093 --> 51:03.659
and waste his time
all over again.

51:04.796 --> 51:08.697
I raised him just so you
could take him from me.

51:10.768 --> 51:13.469
I didn't take him from you.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.406
I am doing this to protect

51:17.408 --> 51:20.509
other parents in the world
from people like you.

51:27.718 --> 51:28.751
(door slamming)

51:28.753 --> 51:29.652
Mr. Trenton,

51:29.654 --> 51:33.823
I don't know you, but I've
known plenty of people like you

51:33.825 --> 51:35.791
in all my years
of public service.

51:37.095 --> 51:39.161
There's nothing wrong
with the desire to win,

51:40.498 --> 51:42.264
but there is something wrong
when you blind yourself

51:42.266 --> 51:45.134
to the needs of
others in the process.

51:45.136 --> 51:48.804
That is called negligence,
and negligence is punishable.

51:51.209 --> 51:54.710
However, evidence does not show

51:54.712 --> 51:56.979
that the defendant's negligence

51:56.980 --> 51:59.247
was the direct cause
of death to the victim.

51:59.250 --> 52:01.650
The plaintiff's evidence
was too speculative

52:01.652 --> 52:04.220
and objectionable to
support liability.

52:04.222 --> 52:09.225
I find the defendant,
Victor Trenton, not liable.

52:09.227 --> 52:10.259
Case closed.

52:11.395 --> 52:12.728
Thank you, your honor.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.133
Thank you.

52:17.135 --> 52:19.735
(moderate music)

52:34.452 --> 52:35.684
Oh, whoa, whoa,
no, no, no, Vick.

52:35.686 --> 52:37.520
Vick, I didn't just
mean for the weekend.

52:37.522 --> 52:38.521
No, no, you gotta go.

52:38.523 --> 52:40.389
Ted, I won the case.

52:40.391 --> 52:41.824
And I'm happy for ya.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.592
[Customer] Ted.

52:43.594 --> 52:44.594
Another.

52:45.730 --> 52:47.163
What's that grin for?

52:47.165 --> 52:48.164
You high?

52:48.166 --> 52:50.299
No, Billy, I'm innocent.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.669
I still think you're guilty.

52:53.671 --> 52:55.171
Well, I don't
care what you think.

52:55.173 --> 52:56.705
You can look in the
newspaper in the mornin',

52:56.707 --> 52:58.674
and it will say otherwise.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.276
I have been acquitted.

53:00.278 --> 53:00.910
Oh yeah?

53:00.912 --> 53:02.678
[Vick] Yeah.

53:02.680 --> 53:03.680
I don't know.

53:04.682 --> 53:07.183
I don't care what you know.

53:08.819 --> 53:10.519
It's about time.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.389
Look, I told you, Vick,
you can't be here right now.

53:14.592 --> 53:15.758
But

53:15.760 --> 53:16.926
it's over, Ted.

53:19.330 --> 53:20.396
Maybe for you.

53:21.766 --> 53:22.932
You gotta go.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.950
(sighs)

54:00.271 --> 54:01.670
God almighty.

54:01.672 --> 54:02.938
[Sara] Jesus, what time is it?

54:02.940 --> 54:03.939
- God, dad.
- What the hell

54:03.941 --> 54:05.407
are you doin' here?

54:05.409 --> 54:07.843
Jeez, I didn't think
you'd be home so late.

54:07.845 --> 54:09.612
How'd you get in?

54:09.614 --> 54:12.314
You gave me a key when I
left for Baylor, remember?

54:13.584 --> 54:14.917
Well, you're goin' back
first thin the mornin'.

54:14.919 --> 54:16.285
You're goin' right back to Waco.

54:16.287 --> 54:17.453
Dad, not until you talk to me.

54:17.455 --> 54:18.687
What do you want to talk about?

54:18.689 --> 54:19.922
Oh, I know, you came to fix me.

54:19.924 --> 54:21.357
Go ahead and do whatever it is...

54:21.359 --> 54:22.791
Come on, I'm not
here to fix you.

54:22.793 --> 54:25.694
I'm here because you spent
14 hours in court today,

54:25.696 --> 54:27.630
and I want to make
sure you're okay.

54:27.632 --> 54:29.965
[Vick] I am fine.

54:29.967 --> 54:32.935
So why don't you just drive
on back to your boyfriend?

54:32.937 --> 54:35.604
Yeah, you know, at least
there's a man in my life

54:35.606 --> 54:37.806
that cares about me
more than football.

54:39.977 --> 54:42.611
You were always the most
important thing in my life.

54:42.613 --> 54:46.315
Why didn't you act like
that while I was here, huh?

54:46.317 --> 54:47.950
There's a lot
worse dads out there,

54:47.952 --> 54:51.820
did a lot crappier things than
miss a daddy-daughter dance

54:51.822 --> 54:54.290
because I had a
damn playoff game.

54:55.860 --> 54:57.026
Wow.

54:57.028 --> 54:59.461
You missed a lot
more than one dance.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.597
Recitals, graduations.

55:01.599 --> 55:02.798
You divorced mom.

55:02.800 --> 55:03.899
Your mother.

55:05.836 --> 55:09.405
It was your mother
who filed for divorce.

55:10.908 --> 55:11.874
- Mm-hm.
- No.

55:11.876 --> 55:13.342
You never told me that.

55:13.344 --> 55:14.376
Oh yes, she did.

55:14.378 --> 55:16.345
[Sara] You're so full of shit.

55:16.347 --> 55:17.680
- Ask her!
- You're so full of shit!

55:17.682 --> 55:18.914
You ask her, you ask her!

55:18.916 --> 55:19.748
That's what happened.

55:19.749 --> 55:20.581
- Yeah, uh-huh.
- Yeah.

55:20.584 --> 55:21.784
[Sara] Bet it did.

55:21.786 --> 55:24.420
You want me to tuck you in?

55:24.422 --> 55:26.955
(door slamming)

55:39.937 --> 55:42.004
(sighs)

55:48.512 --> 55:50.646
(snores)

55:54.919 --> 55:57.052
(grunts)

56:19.710 --> 56:23.045
(bicycle bell ringing)

56:34.492 --> 56:37.159
(door closing)

56:43.834 --> 56:46.969
(newspaper rustling)

57:22.206 --> 57:24.473
(sighs)

57:28.646 --> 57:31.180
(phone ringing)

57:34.051 --> 57:35.051
Hello.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.985
[Woman] Uh, who is this?

57:36.987 --> 57:39.588
This is Coach Vick.

57:39.590 --> 57:41.924
You're on the board, right?

57:41.926 --> 57:44.693
[Woman] Yeah,
that's right, Vick.

57:44.695 --> 57:45.928
Well, I just called to tell you

57:45.930 --> 57:48.997
that I've been acquitted
in the lawsuit.

57:48.999 --> 57:50.199
[Woman] Okay.

57:50.201 --> 57:52.201
I'll make sure the other
board members know.

57:54.138 --> 57:55.138
Great.

57:56.941 --> 57:58.073
When is the vote?

58:00.010 --> 58:03.512
[Woman] Um, we haven't
scheduled that meeting yet,

58:03.514 --> 58:04.880
but we'll let you know.

58:06.550 --> 58:07.616
Okay.

58:07.618 --> 58:08.884
- You take care now, Vick.
- Bye.

58:08.886 --> 58:11.553
(dial tone humming)

58:14.925 --> 58:17.759
(moderate music)

59:14.919 --> 59:17.586
(bell ringing)

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:45.407
(grunts)

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.151
[Producer] We need Wendy.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.185
We need Wendy to set.

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:58.020
Start in five.

01:00:58.022 --> 01:00:59.087
[Vick] Wendy.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.822
What do you want?

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.357
[Vick] I was hoping we
could do another interview.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:03.792
[Wendy] Why?

01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:05.427
[Vick] Well, I want
everybody out there

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:06.995
to know that I'm innocent.

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.164
But you're not innocent.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.866
The case is closed.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:13.835
Look, you may be innocent
in a court of law or whatever,

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.705
but it's still
kind of your fault.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:20.742
Take it from me, a little
apology never hurt nobody.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:22.210
[Producer] Wendy,
let's go, we need you.

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:23.745
[Vick] Hey, wait, Wendy.

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:24.747
Hey.

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:26.683
[Wendy] Thank you.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.700
[Vick] Hello.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.034
[Drew] I just wanted
to call and let you know

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.302
that Mark's been chatting
with the counselors

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:48.804
from the school district
like you recommended.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:50.005
Well?

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.205
[Drew] And that was
goin' well for a while,

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.458
but it didn't help.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.709
Then I don't know
if there's anything

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.143
I can do or say that would help.

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:56.812
[Drew] Coach, it
would mean the world

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.574
if you could just sit
down and talk with him.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:03.218
He testified against
me in a court, Drew.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.454
I don't think there's
anything I can do or say.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:28.911
Dammit.

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:43.292
Thank you.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:53.802
You want a beer?

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:57.973
I'm 17.

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:01.410
I'm messin' with you.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:02.571
How are things with the team?

01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:05.881
I don't know.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.251
I quit.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:10.386
Oh.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.487
Yeah, that's too bad.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:17.192
Unless you're better
off without football.

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:19.796
Maybe, yeah.

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:27.068
You know, when I left, the
team was doing really good.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.303
Coach Greg's doing really good.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.371
Yeah, I heard.

01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.142
You applying for college?

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:35.978
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:38.182 --> 01:03:40.482
I got lots of extra time
now to work on my paper,

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:42.317
without practice.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.486
I'll bet you do.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.321
How have you been
doing, pretty good?

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.522
Fine, fine.

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:49.524
I got a lot of extra time too.

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:52.594
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:54.062
For what?

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:55.463
Doin' nothin'.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.300
And I hate it.

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:04.039
[Mark] Hey, listen,

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:07.309
I want to say I'm sorry about
the things I said in court.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:09.477
No, no, no, no, that's
water under the bridge.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:10.912
[Mark] But it's...

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.554
[Vick] Theresa made
you say that, right?

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.217
Nobody can make me say anything.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:18.386
What are we here for?

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.222
What do you want to talk about?

01:04:20.224 --> 01:04:22.524
What do you really
want to talk about?

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.563
I don't know.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:31.334
Ah.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:35.438
Thank you.

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:42.510
You need a ride home?

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:43.879
No, it's all good.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:44.980
My dad's parked
around the corner.

01:04:44.982 --> 01:04:45.647
All right.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:48.416
Well, let me know if
you need anything.

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:49.418
Thanks, coach.

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:51.586
Later.

01:04:59.463 --> 01:05:00.463
Christ.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:02.565
Hey, Mark!

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:07.219
[Mark] Yeah?

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.460
You actually feel any better?

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:10.907
'Cause I don't.

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:13.575
I feel terrible.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.277
I don't even know what to do.

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:17.846
I'm goin' outta my dadgum mind.

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.480
I'm tryin' to fix everything,
everything in my power.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:22.050
I'm tryin' to fix things,
and I can't do it.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:23.585
I don't know what to think.

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:25.587
I feel terrible too.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.155
I can't even sleep.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:32.194
I killed him, coach.

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:34.262
Benny was the nicest guy, and
now he's dead because of me.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.931
Benny didn't
deserve any of this.

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:36.564
No, you didn't.

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.099
You did not kill Benny.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.267
You hear me?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.602
- I...
- You didn't kill Benny!

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:43.638
Yes, sir.

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:48.477
Thanks, coach.

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:50.679
Be a man.

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:53.581
We're both gonna be a man.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:55.083
Goodnight.

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:56.618
- Sir, goodnight.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.719
Yes, sir.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.961
(moderate music)

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:17.138
(sighs)

01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:58.747
Vick.

01:06:58.749 --> 01:06:59.547
What are you doin' here?

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.750
Oh, sorry, Greg.

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:03.718
I like what you've
done to the place,

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.287
but where's all the trophies?

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:08.690
I don't have any of those.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.409
Well, you will have,

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:12.127
if you keep goin' like
you're goin' out there.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:13.561
You're doin' great, son.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.196
Thank you, Vick, thank you.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.331
I appreciate that.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:21.669
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.305
I know you were just tryin'

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:26.241
to do the right thing
when you forfeited.

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:31.579
Wow.

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:32.781
Yeah, I know.

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:34.716
I'm new to it.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:35.784
Yeah.

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:37.719
I wasn't expectin' that.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.320
[Vick] How'm I doin'?

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:41.222
[Greg] You know,
you're doin' all right.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.424
Well, good.

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:43.358
(laughs)

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.527
Thank you, that means a lot.

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:47.128
You're welcome.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:51.266
Look, coach, if I could, I'd
just like to talk to the team.

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:58.339
You know, I think
that'd be a good idea.

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:00.308
They need closure
with you, right?

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.443
But you are suspended.

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:02.677
[Vick] From coaching.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:05.613
Well, I wouldn't
mess with the board.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:06.848
Yeah, I don't know what's takin'

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:08.249
that dadgum board so long.

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:19.594
Did you do this?

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.095
Yeah.

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:22.764
I like movin' the
backs like that.

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:25.800
It's an interesting stack.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.236
You know what you're doin'.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:29.871
Yeah, a little bit.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:32.541
You always did.

01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:35.478
Huh.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.716
This is the last place
I ever talked to him.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:42.550
What about?

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.551
[Vick] College.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:45.254
His future.

01:08:50.527 --> 01:08:51.792
I wish he was still here.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:55.162
There's so many things
I'd like to tell him.

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:58.166
I would love to talk
to that kid again.

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:00.702
You know, we all feel that way.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:02.670
The whole team.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.839
There's gotta be somethin'

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:06.774
that we can do to
help those kids.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.479
It's a little bit harder
than movin' Xs and Os

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.962
around a whiteboard,
though, isn't it?

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:17.386
It is.

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:24.826
(sighs)

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:34.935
(phone ringing)

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:36.703
[Sara] Dad?

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:37.805
Sara.

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:42.810
I'm sorry.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:44.779
[Sara] What's wrong?

01:09:46.316 --> 01:09:47.615
[Vick] Nothin'.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:48.683
[Sara] Hey, don't move.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:49.751
I'll be right there.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.719
Don't do anything, dad!

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.819
Sara.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:53.854
(dial tone humming)

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:54.956
Sara!

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:10.772
(car door slamming)

01:10:10.774 --> 01:10:13.942
(knocking on door)

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:17.379
Jesus.

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:22.317
God, I was so worried!

01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:23.418
[Vick] Why?

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.686
- Are you gonna hurt yourself?
- No!

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:25.687
[Sara] Have you been drinking?

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:26.888
No!

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.406
God, I've never heard you

01:10:28.407 --> 01:10:29.923
start a conversation
with an apology.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:30.758
You wanna come in?

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.893
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:41.603
What's goin' on?

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:46.342
You thirsty?

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:48.310
I'm fine.

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:54.817
Dad, what?

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:01.690
I'm sorry.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.392
I'm sorry for a lot of things,

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:07.295
but I'm very sorry
for pushin' you out,

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.832
and I'm sorry for
criticizin' you,

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:16.037
and I should have known
you were tryin' to help me.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.373
It's okay, dad.

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:19.375
No, really.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:24.946
And number two, I'm sorry for

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.620
James, the James thing.

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:34.656
God, dad.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:37.476
- No, I mean...
- It took a while.

01:11:37.477 --> 01:11:40.295
I really should have been
happy for ya, but I was jealous.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:42.764
He took my little
girl away from me,

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:44.032
and I didn't understand.

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:46.000
He's really good to me.

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:48.836
I shoulda known
that you bein' happy

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:52.907
was what should make me happy.

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:55.610
Hoo, I really wasn't
prepared for this, dad.

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:56.612
I'm not through.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:01.449
I'm sorry about the family,
about you, me, and mom,

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:07.655
because I know that
I put football first.

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:11.392
I didn't know I was
doin' it, but I did.

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:13.796
I truly,

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:18.666
I want my baby back,
if she'll have me.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:21.803
I waited a long time for
this, you know that, right?

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.037
[Vick] Yeah.

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:26.774
Yeah, dad, I would like that.

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:31.012
Jesus.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.014
I think it's time
for that drink.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:33.848
(laughs)

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:34.850
Yeah?

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:37.786
Join me?

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.859
Is this the hug part?

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:45.893
I guess it is.

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:46.994
Comin' in hot.

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:50.965
Feels better than
that touchdown, right?

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:51.933
[Vick] Uh, yeah.

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:52.967
No, it does.

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:56.404
(Vick and Sara laughing)

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:07.449
Sorry.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.420
Wow.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:18.960
Hey, Vick.

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:21.095
Listen, it turns out
that I have gotten myself

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:24.732
a brand-new whisky glass
with your name on it.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:27.001
I think you'd better come
down and have the first sip.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:28.102
See you soon.

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:34.876
Good to see ya.

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:36.861
[Vick] Thanks, Ted.

01:13:36.862 --> 01:13:38.845
[Ted] I just got this
brand-new, beautiful glass.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.114
Ain't that somethin'?

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:41.916
Just like the other one.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.084
Ah.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:44.185
Enjoy.

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:45.187
[Vick] Thank you.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.591
New Saints coach
is a damn good one.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.093
He's better'n you ever were.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.548
He may be.

01:13:56.549 --> 01:13:59.167
I heard you won't be on the
sidelines during the playoffs.

01:13:59.169 --> 01:14:01.502
Yeah, that's sad,

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:03.806
but true.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.675
What's the matter with you?

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:10.778
Don't you got a fire
in your belly no more?

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.712
I do, Billy.

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:13.214
It's just a different fire.

01:14:15.819 --> 01:14:16.918
What's the matter with him?

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.085
He doin' yoga or somethin'?

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:19.120
(laughs)

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:21.589
Are you on yoga, Vick?

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:22.657
I think he's on yoga.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:23.691
- Is this yoga?
- Yeah.

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:24.892
I think you're on yoga.

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:25.894
Cheers, Ted.

01:14:41.211 --> 01:14:43.945
(phone ringing)

01:14:46.216 --> 01:14:47.216
Theresa.

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:50.117
[Theresa] Who is this?

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:51.119
Uh.

01:14:56.793 --> 01:14:59.794
(dial tone humming)

01:15:05.268 --> 01:15:07.535
(sighs)

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:20.248
(whistle tweeting)

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:22.183
Well, son of a gun, Vick.

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:23.017
[Vick] Sorry, Greg.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.502
I'll get outta here.

01:15:24.503 --> 01:15:25.986
I guess I wasn't as
sly as I thought I was.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:27.655
No, you don't be crazy, now.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.257
You stay right where you are.

01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:31.158
[Vick] The board votes tomorrow.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.595
I'm just tryin'
to calm my nerves.

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:36.764
Well, heck, I'd vote for ya.

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:38.566
You deserve that
state championship.

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:40.268
It's what you always wanted.

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:42.169
Yeah, we all do.

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:45.006
[Greg] That's right.

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:46.274
It's good to see you.

01:15:46.276 --> 01:15:47.742
Good to see you, Greg.

01:15:48.745 --> 01:15:49.944
Go get 'em, coach.

01:15:49.946 --> 01:15:51.296
[Greg] Thank you.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:52.647
Tell seven to keep
that right foot back.

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:54.215
[Greg] I was thinkin'
the same thing.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.551
(laughs)

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:10.632
Glen.

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:12.634
Hello.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240
Ann.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.274
Three votes in your favor.

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:23.111
Four in mine.

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:26.280
Guess you're not
innocent after all.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:36.324
(sighs)

01:16:36.326 --> 01:16:38.025
Que sera sera.

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:40.194
It's all right.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:42.064
We'll live.

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:52.106
(moderate music)

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:01.766
What's up, dude?

01:17:01.767 --> 01:17:02.850
- What's up, man?
- How are you?

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:03.852
Good, bro.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:05.987
- How are you?
- Good.

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:07.922
- Good to see you.
- Here, come get some food.

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:08.756
[Mark] Yeah, yeah.

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:11.626
(all chatting)

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:25.007
[Vick] Theresa.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:36.351
This is for you.

01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:40.187
I had to deliver it by hand.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:43.357
This is not a legal thing?

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:45.761
No.

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:47.328
Oh.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.233
Do you want to come in?

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:53.868
No.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:57.071
Thank you.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:58.305
You should read that.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:02.443
I didn't know.

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:04.212
Okay?

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:08.315
I'm sorry for all of this.

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:10.985
I didn't know.

01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:12.821
I'm sorry.

01:18:22.265 --> 01:18:25.466
(thunder rumbling)

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:35.710
[Benny] Benny Robinson,
senior, college essay.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.112
Oh my God.

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:41.816
[Benny] There are a lot of
ways that people talk about me.

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:43.284
They say that I'm fast,

01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:45.286
they say that I'm
nice, or I'm strong.

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:47.788
But I don't think
anyone's ever told me

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:49.290
that I was cool, you know?

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:50.825
And that's just fine with me,

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.293
'cause I don't think that
I'm all that cool anyway,

01:18:52.295 --> 01:18:56.063
but that's why my coach,
Coach Vick, is my hero.

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:59.393
'Cause he makes me feel
like the coolest guy ever.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.268
Coach Vick's hard on me,

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.070
but I learned pretty
quick that he does that

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.072
because he cares a
whole lot about me.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.307
And he knows that
I can do better

01:19:06.309 --> 01:19:08.109
and be better if he pushes me.

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.144
I wouldn't have stayed in school

01:19:10.146 --> 01:19:11.445
if it weren't for Coach Vick.

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:15.349
No matter what happens
or where I go to college,

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:17.084
Coach Vick'd be there for me.

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:19.820
He's like the dad I never had.

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:24.225
I hope someday I can
inspire people like he can,

01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:28.395
just like I feel my best self
every day I play football

01:19:28.397 --> 01:19:29.764
or work out to get better.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.466
He's always there for me.

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.301
He's always rootin'.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.237
I wouldn't change my
time with the Saints

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:37.872
for anything in the world.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.276
I love you, son.

01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:48.115
"That's why I want to
be a Saint forever."

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:50.951
"Because I don't
think I'll ever find"

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.987
"a better group of
guys to be around"

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:59.293
"who like me so much and
who I know are my brothers."

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:05.499
"I'm gonna miss them
after this season."

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:10.037
"I hope they don't
miss me too bad"

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.341
"and that they still
play good when I'm gone."

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:22.284
Guys,

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.019
when we lost Benny,

01:20:31.093 --> 01:20:32.810
I didn't know what to do.

01:20:32.811 --> 01:20:34.528
All I've ever done my whole
life is win football games.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.463
That's all I cared about.

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:38.232
I'm here to tell you right now.

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:43.070
I love each and
every one of you.

01:20:43.906 --> 01:20:45.172
I'm very proud of you.

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:47.474
Proud of all of you.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:51.445
But I can tell you
this right now.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:57.151
This game, it is not near as big

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:00.454
as what you have
already overcome.

01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:05.359
I want you to win the
state championship,

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:06.427
I do, but

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:11.632
it's not as important as
what you already have.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:14.168
And that is a team.

01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:16.304
You are part of a team,

01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:18.439
and that's gonna stay with you
forever, I promise you that.

01:21:18.441 --> 01:21:20.040
Now and forever.

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:22.509
Because you've been in the
trenches with each other.

01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:26.480
You've fought together,
you've pained together,

01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:28.582
you've passioned together.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:30.484
You've won and you've lost,

01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:33.487
but you're gonna remember this
for the rest of your life.

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:38.492
You are part of a
team now and forever.

01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:41.263
Benny

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:43.631
will be

01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:46.500
a Saint forever.

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:50.638
Because he's right here with us.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:56.944
He'll be in this locker room
from now till the end of time.

01:21:56.946 --> 01:21:59.580
For every kid that comes
in this locker room,

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:01.515
they're gonna know
who Benny was.

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:06.487
He's in your heart,
he's in your head,

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:09.089
he's all around us.

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:11.592
Now.

01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:16.163
(team applauding)

01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:17.331
[Greg] All right, boys!

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.533
Everyone up, let's go!

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:21.035
Take us out on three!

01:22:21.037 --> 01:22:22.503
One, two, three!

01:22:22.505 --> 01:22:24.138
[Team] Protect the family!

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.707
[Greg] Let's go, let's go!

01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:27.709
Come on!

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.581
Thank you, coach.

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:37.151
Go get 'em.

01:22:37.153 --> 01:22:38.218
Sure will.

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:41.622
Let's go, boys!
