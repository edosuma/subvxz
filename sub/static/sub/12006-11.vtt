00:01.927 --> 00:05.229
Being in Peru makes me feel
like my life means something.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.999
Are you saying you don't
want to be with me anymore?

00:08.100 --> 00:11.870
Of course I do, but this
work... it's going to be my life.

00:11.971 --> 00:13.872
- What fraternity is Tank in again?
- Omega Psi!

00:13.973 --> 00:15.940
One of them invited me to
that luau they're having.

00:16.042 --> 00:17.909
- It's a dogfight.
- A what?

00:18.010 --> 00:21.579
One of these days, all these girls are gonna
get together and pull a dogfight on you guys.

00:21.681 --> 00:23.514
Not cool, bro.

00:23.615 --> 00:26.584
This is a buyout agreement for a business

00:26.685 --> 00:29.019
we're tearing down in East Riverside
to make room for our project.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.955
He asked me what I thought
and I said it was a good deal.

00:32.057 --> 00:34.357
It is... for your boss.

00:34.458 --> 00:38.662
You have a text from "Mandy"?
So are you two, like, together?

00:43.835 --> 00:45.502

00:45.603 --> 00:47.604

- Uh, I...</i>

00:47.706 --> 00:49.106
Can't feel my legs.

00:49.207 --> 00:51.675
Oh, sorry.

00:51.775 --> 00:52.909
(Chuckles)

00:53.010 --> 00:55.244
- See what I did there?
- Yeah, very funny.

00:55.345 --> 00:56.946
- (Chuckles)
- Read my lips.

00:57.047 --> 00:58.881
- Yeah.
- Less bad jokes,

00:58.982 --> 01:01.184
- more kissing.
- Ah.

01:05.555 --> 01:07.456
- Oh, uh...
- Uh...

01:07.557 --> 01:09.291
- Sorry.
- Jorge.

01:09.392 --> 01:11.360
(Stammers)

01:13.296 --> 01:16.232
- (Groans)
- You haven't told him about us.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.734
- No.
- Guess he knows now.

01:21.854 --> 01:24.189
Bay: The artist's name is Todd Grafton.

01:24.290 --> 01:27.092
He took the picture in 1994.

01:28.230 --> 01:29.610
_

01:29.729 --> 01:31.897
It's the same picture.

01:31.998 --> 01:34.099
It's in his book of photography, too.

01:36.650 --> 01:42.207
_

01:43.275 --> 01:46.578
But... the album

01:46.679 --> 01:49.380
that it came from is called

01:49.481 --> 01:51.249
"My Snaps." You showed it to me.

01:51.250 --> 01:56.915
_

01:56.919 --> 01:59.624
If Mandy is passing off work as her own,

01:59.725 --> 02:01.858
what else is she lying about?

02:01.859 --> 02:02.591
_

02:03.233 --> 02:04.637
_

02:04.729 --> 02:06.863

02:06.864 --> 02:11.318
_

02:11.460 --> 02:15.001
_

02:15.973 --> 02:17.140
Okay, uh...

02:17.242 --> 02:19.743
all right, that is not it, okay?

02:19.844 --> 02:22.678
I care about you. I don't
want to see you get hurt.

02:22.679 --> 02:25.380
_

02:26.316 --> 02:27.883
You've never even met her!

02:30.720 --> 02:32.810
_

02:34.258 --> 02:36.325
You are?

02:37.220 --> 02:40.755
_

02:40.756 --> 02:47.494

02:49.538 --> 02:51.072

03:11.226 --> 03:12.960
I was looking for the right moment.

03:13.061 --> 03:15.830
Walking in on the two of you making
out... yeah, that was perfect.

03:15.931 --> 03:17.165
I'm so sorry about that.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.801
(Sighs) You're a great guy

03:19.902 --> 03:22.503
- and you deserve better.
- Look, you've made your choice.

03:22.604 --> 03:26.140
I'm not happy about it, but your
community service is over in a week.

03:26.241 --> 03:29.342
Let's get through it and work
together like professionals

03:29.443 --> 03:31.812
and you and Campbell can
go live happily ever after.

03:31.913 --> 03:35.682
Actually I was gonna ask Dr. J

03:35.783 --> 03:38.584
if I could keep volunteering
after my hours are up.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.387
Fine.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.090
- You do me a favor?
- Anything.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.428
Spare me any more P.D.A....

03:49.997 --> 03:51.331
A.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.901
Your signing's gotten really good.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.444
- Do you have a second?
- No.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.746
Jess said you wanted me

04:07.848 --> 04:09.681
to get these buyout contracts signed?

04:09.782 --> 04:11.450
Yeah, 3000 block of ashland.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.686
- Chop chop.
- Actually... (Clears throat)

04:14.787 --> 04:15.921
I'd prefer not to.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.757
Why not?

04:18.858 --> 04:21.024
I don't think you're
playing fair with the owners.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.395
Really? Have you been hearing complaints?

04:23.496 --> 04:25.897
No, but that's because
you've been lying to them

04:25.998 --> 04:28.066
- about the value of the properties.
- (Sighs)

04:28.167 --> 04:29.392
Value is subjective.

04:29.393 --> 04:31.915
I offered what I felt
their businesses were worth.

04:32.037 --> 04:34.606
They were free to disagree
or get a second opinion.

04:34.707 --> 04:37.376
- You gave me false information. They trusted me...
- It wasn't false.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.943
And you used that.

04:39.044 --> 04:41.813
So now it's my fault that they trusted you?

04:41.914 --> 04:44.949
No, that's on me, but moving forward

04:45.050 --> 04:47.185
I would like to stick
to what you hired me for.

04:47.286 --> 04:48.920
You're a business owner now, Regina.

04:49.021 --> 04:51.089
If you want to keep K&D in the
black, you need to be willing

04:51.190 --> 04:54.058
- to play advantages when they come your way.
- I'll take my chances.

04:58.329 --> 05:00.030
- So I don't have to...
- No.

05:00.131 --> 05:03.567
You've lost your value.
I want the design specs

05:03.668 --> 05:05.269
for the main lobby by lunch.

05:15.847 --> 05:17.247
- Boo!
- Whoa.

05:17.348 --> 05:19.982
Oh, sorry. A little porn before art?

05:20.083 --> 05:22.018
Yes, I am looking up porn

05:22.119 --> 05:24.387
before our lecture on
the art of Ancient Greece.

05:25.656 --> 05:28.157
Actually, uh...

05:28.258 --> 05:31.227
I was just... you remember that
thing I was telling you about

05:31.328 --> 05:34.997
my friend Emmett, how he's dating
this girl that he met online?

05:35.098 --> 05:38.134
- Yeah.
- Okay, do you think it's weird

05:38.235 --> 05:40.169
that when you search for her,

05:40.270 --> 05:42.071
her name only pops up on the website

05:42.172 --> 05:44.773
- where he met her?
- That's definitely weird.

05:47.010 --> 05:49.845
I was afraid that you'd
think I was caring too much.

05:49.947 --> 05:51.347
No, I think you're being a good friend.

05:53.116 --> 05:55.684
Uh, you have a picture of this
girl, right? Off that site?

05:55.785 --> 05:57.286
Yeah, miss deep thoughts.

05:57.387 --> 05:59.721
(Laughs) Well, you can
do a reverse image search.

05:59.823 --> 06:01.357
See if her photo pops up anywhere else.

06:01.458 --> 06:04.025
- A reverse what?
- A reverse image search.

06:04.126 --> 06:06.695
I used it once when I met this
girl on spring break in Mazatlan.

06:06.796 --> 06:09.832
I never got her number, but
I had her photo in my phone.

06:09.933 --> 06:12.400
So I search her picture, it
turns out she lives in Akron,

06:12.502 --> 06:16.071
- but she's a lesbian.
- Yeah, that's not gonna work out.

06:16.172 --> 06:18.006
- (Both laugh)
- Okay, so how do you do it?

06:18.107 --> 06:20.041
Teacher: Would you all
please take your seats?

06:20.142 --> 06:22.577
- I'll show you later.
- Today we're going to study

06:22.678 --> 06:23.978
the impressionist era.

06:25.614 --> 06:28.783
Ask Colin if he'll do a
double shift. Yeah, thank you.

06:28.884 --> 06:31.719
- (Beeps)
- Well, Toby hasn't shown up for work.

06:32.821 --> 06:34.288
Kathryn?

06:35.591 --> 06:37.291
Someone leaked my book.

06:37.392 --> 06:38.793
What?

06:38.894 --> 06:40.695
How did that happen?

06:40.796 --> 06:43.663
I have no idea, but they hate it.

06:43.764 --> 06:45.331
I'm sure they don't hate it.

06:45.432 --> 06:48.602
Uh, "I can't decide which I hate more,

06:48.703 --> 06:52.639
Kennish's staccato style or
the sleazy sports sexcapades."

06:52.740 --> 06:55.074
Well... they're just trying to be quippy.

06:55.175 --> 06:58.545
- I'd ignore them if I were you.
- These pages were a first draft.

06:58.646 --> 07:00.881
I hadn't even gotten notes from Lydia yet.

07:01.883 --> 07:02.849
Oh my God, Lydia!

07:02.950 --> 07:05.785
What if she thinks I leaked my own pages?

07:05.887 --> 07:07.853
Let's just review here, all right?

07:07.954 --> 07:10.223
You showed the pages to me, to Lydia...

07:10.324 --> 07:12.825
- anyone else?
- Renzo.

07:15.429 --> 07:17.630
<i>- Renzo!
- (Elevator dings)</i>

07:19.166 --> 07:22.068
So I figured I should find
out if I really love medicine

07:22.169 --> 07:24.737
before committing the next
12 years of my life to it.

07:24.838 --> 07:26.839
Let me talk to the board chair.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.509
We might be able to wrangle
up a part-time paid position.

07:29.609 --> 07:31.511
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:31.611 --> 07:34.413
Oh, that's awesome. Thank you.

07:34.514 --> 07:36.448
Good night. See you tomorrow.

07:44.524 --> 07:48.160
So, Daphne, you want to go out sometime?

07:49.395 --> 07:51.229
Uh...

07:53.066 --> 07:55.566
- (Shouts, screams)
- Catch.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.035
- Come on, man, let's go!
- (Sobs)

08:02.274 --> 08:04.141
<i>(Elevator dings)</i>

08:15.152 --> 08:17.619
- He's gone.
- Are you sure?

08:17.720 --> 08:19.822
Yeah, Daphne said he
had a bandaged left arm.

08:19.923 --> 08:22.959
I treated a drug addict
with an arm abscess.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.327
Adam Larson. Desk clerk saw him sign out.

08:25.428 --> 08:28.563
- That's him.
- So he attacked you?

08:29.966 --> 08:32.799
- When?
- Uh...

08:32.900 --> 08:34.702
Last year.

08:40.109 --> 08:42.110
Was the guy ever caught?

08:42.211 --> 08:44.679
He served his time. I guess he's out now.

08:44.780 --> 08:47.582
If he comes here again, I'll
beat the living crap out of him.

08:47.683 --> 08:49.817
I got this, Campbell.

08:49.918 --> 08:51.819
Why don't you go back to work?

08:53.089 --> 08:54.522
I'm okay.

08:56.025 --> 08:58.425
If you need me, I'll be right outside.

09:01.997 --> 09:04.198
That guy shouldn't be allowed back here.

09:04.299 --> 09:06.033
That's not how this place works.

09:06.134 --> 09:08.202
We have to treat whoever
needs medical care.

09:08.303 --> 09:10.137
(Scoffs)

09:12.574 --> 09:14.341
Even if he's dangerous?

09:14.442 --> 09:16.377
He didn't show any violent behavior.

09:16.478 --> 09:18.779
If he had, we would have called 911.

09:18.881 --> 09:20.882
And it might have been too late.

09:20.983 --> 09:23.750
Look, I take what he did
to you very seriously.

09:23.851 --> 09:27.020
If and when he were to come back,
we'd keep a close eye on him.

09:27.121 --> 09:29.723
Beyond that there's
nothing we can do about it.

09:29.824 --> 09:34.360
Like it or not, we have to treat
every patient with the same respect.

09:34.461 --> 09:36.229
Is this because of me and Campbell?

09:36.330 --> 09:39.900
- What?
- Is this your way of...

09:40.001 --> 09:41.868
getting back at me?

09:41.969 --> 09:44.671
Daphne, this is the job...

09:45.973 --> 09:49.275
to help people no matter who they are.

09:49.376 --> 09:52.145
And if you can't deal with that,

09:52.246 --> 09:54.312
you shouldn't go into medicine.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.617
(Laughs) Of course it wasn't me.

09:58.718 --> 10:01.486
Do I look like an Asian Julian Assange?

10:01.588 --> 10:03.656
Although I could rock
that platinum blond hair.

10:03.757 --> 10:05.558
You're the only one I showed it to

10:05.659 --> 10:08.326
and I know how much you
love those gossip blogs.

10:08.428 --> 10:10.295
Oh my God.

10:10.396 --> 10:14.033
- You're serious.
- There's no other explanation.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.468
And now my book is out
there for everyone to judge,

10:16.570 --> 10:18.203
and I haven't even finished it yet.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.305
I've supported your writing from the start,

10:20.406 --> 10:22.340
took you to New York,
introduced you to Lydia...

10:22.442 --> 10:25.077
why would I sabotage all that now?

10:25.178 --> 10:28.213
Because you love to stir things
up, create a little drama.

10:28.314 --> 10:30.515
- (Sighs)
- Do you know why I was late to class?

10:30.616 --> 10:34.319
My friend's in the hospital starting chemo.

10:35.488 --> 10:37.289
I have other things going on in my life

10:37.390 --> 10:39.257
besides you and your book.

10:39.358 --> 10:42.494
I don't know what kind
of friend you think I am,

10:42.595 --> 10:45.029
but I'm starting to wonder
if you've ever been mine.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.688
You can't just pick and
choose where you serve.

12:53.788 --> 12:55.723
What about time off for good behavior?

12:55.824 --> 12:57.825
I've worked really hard,
just ask Dr. Jackson.

12:57.926 --> 13:01.528
- Only a judge can do that.
- Fine, let's go talk to a judge.

13:01.629 --> 13:03.931
Even if the courts got involved,

13:04.032 --> 13:06.200
this would take weeks to play out.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.635
You only have one week left to serve.

13:08.737 --> 13:11.138
This is so unfair.

13:11.239 --> 13:13.540
I should not have to face
the guy who attacked me.

13:15.409 --> 13:17.911
When you saw him, did
he say anything to you,

13:18.012 --> 13:21.481
- did threaten you in any way?
- No.

13:23.551 --> 13:25.719
My advice? Go back to the clinic,

13:25.819 --> 13:28.020
keep your head down,

13:28.122 --> 13:29.822
finish out your service.

13:31.559 --> 13:32.892
(Sighs)

13:32.993 --> 13:35.362
I'm not going to say I told you so...

13:35.463 --> 13:36.563
Thank you.

13:36.664 --> 13:38.732
But I knew that man was using you.

13:38.832 --> 13:42.335
Fine. You were right,
I was wrong. Satisfied?

13:42.436 --> 13:43.570
No, I am not.

13:43.671 --> 13:46.372
I feel sick to my stomach
knowing our friends,

13:46.473 --> 13:48.140
our neighbors, are being swindled

13:48.241 --> 13:50.309
and that you continue to
work for the man responsible.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.911
I don't exactly have a choice, okay?

13:53.012 --> 13:54.713
I tried to quit once
and Wes wouldn't let me.

13:54.814 --> 13:56.615
What are you, his slave?

13:56.716 --> 14:00.486
He gave me a $50,000
salary advance to buy K&D,

14:00.587 --> 14:02.288
so yeah, in a way I am.

14:02.389 --> 14:05.624
At least now I'm back to
doing what I was hired to do.

14:07.627 --> 14:10.262
And your reputation? What about that?

14:11.931 --> 14:14.132
- What about it?
- Never mind.

14:14.233 --> 14:15.566
Ma, spit it out.

14:15.668 --> 14:18.836
<i>I hear people are calling you la malinche.</i>

14:18.937 --> 14:22.507
(Scoffs) Cortes's whore?

14:22.608 --> 14:24.609
They think I'm sleeping with my boss?

14:26.044 --> 14:28.979
You too? Oh, thanks a lot.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.450
Regina, I barely recognize you these days,

14:32.551 --> 14:36.354
so caught up in your fancy new
car and your expensive clothes.

14:36.455 --> 14:39.123
Where is the woman I raised,
the one with such integrity?

14:39.224 --> 14:41.091
I am right here, ma.

14:41.193 --> 14:43.093
I care about these people, I swear.

14:43.195 --> 14:44.995
I just don't know what else to do.

14:45.096 --> 14:47.231
You fight back.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.735
<i>- (Knocks)
- John: Toby.</i>

14:55.373 --> 14:57.107
Toby, what the hell is going on?

14:57.209 --> 14:59.609
I've been calling you. You
haven't shown up for work.

14:59.711 --> 15:01.912
You... Toby!

15:03.781 --> 15:05.649
Tobe?

15:08.153 --> 15:09.920
What happened?

15:17.094 --> 15:18.427
(Sighs)

15:20.898 --> 15:22.966
You were right.

15:24.701 --> 15:26.702
You tried to tell me.

15:27.938 --> 15:30.039
Everybody tried to tell me.

15:31.308 --> 15:32.942
Tell you what?

15:33.978 --> 15:36.012
That me and Nikki...

15:36.113 --> 15:38.447
(Sighs) wouldn't work out.

15:43.052 --> 15:44.687
I guess you can say "I told you so."

15:44.788 --> 15:47.189
Honey, I'm not going to do that.

15:47.290 --> 15:49.525
(Whispers) Oh, sweetie.

15:49.626 --> 15:52.327
Do you know how much I
wish I had been wrong?

15:55.832 --> 15:57.700
- I feel so stupid.
- No.

15:57.801 --> 16:00.002
Do you know how many stupid
things I've done in my life?

16:00.103 --> 16:01.637
Listen to me.

16:01.738 --> 16:04.106
You tried, okay?

16:04.207 --> 16:06.208
No one can ever say you didn't try.

16:08.812 --> 16:11.579
What you're doing right now takes courage,

16:11.680 --> 16:14.816
to recognize this and to move on

16:14.917 --> 16:17.385
and I'm really proud of you.

16:19.588 --> 16:22.023
I'm a 19-year-old divorcé.

16:22.124 --> 16:25.092
- And you will learn from this.
- I don't wanna learn from it.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.929
I wanna be with her.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.298
I know, I know.

16:30.399 --> 16:32.801
Your mom and I,

16:32.902 --> 16:35.002
we're there for you.

16:35.103 --> 16:38.606
We're gonna get you out of this
lease, you move back in with us.

16:38.707 --> 16:42.009
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

16:48.050 --> 16:49.683
Okay, now find her picture.

16:49.784 --> 16:51.285
(Beeps)

16:52.955 --> 16:54.621
(Cellphone chimes)

16:56.524 --> 16:59.427
Ha! I'm not gonna be blackballed.

16:59.527 --> 17:00.861
- Thank God.
- Ohh.

17:00.963 --> 17:02.229
Honestly, I was a little worried.

17:02.331 --> 17:04.031
A bunch of the guys in my pledge class

17:04.132 --> 17:05.898
kind of freaked out about the whole thing.

17:06.001 --> 17:08.068
And I was afraid if they
took a vote, it'd be close.

17:08.169 --> 17:09.970
What, seriously?

17:10.070 --> 17:13.106
Here, now you take her picture...

17:13.207 --> 17:15.008
and you drag it.

17:15.108 --> 17:17.577
Yeah, but then the coach
got involved and he was like,

17:17.678 --> 17:20.180
"if Tank gets kicked out, it's gonna
cause a lot of drama on the team."

17:20.281 --> 17:22.548
So the only reason you're still
in is because of the coach?

17:22.648 --> 17:24.284
- (Beeps)
- I... I mean...

17:24.385 --> 17:25.718
Oh, there she is!

17:25.819 --> 17:27.319
Heyward?

17:27.421 --> 17:30.523
The one in K.C.? I thought
you said she was from Seattle.

17:30.624 --> 17:32.359
That's what Emmett said.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.827
Her name is Jennifer Murray.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.064
No, it's Mandy something.
Uh... Mandy Starling.

17:38.165 --> 17:40.900
She seems to think her
name is Jennifer Murray.

17:42.168 --> 17:44.336
Why would she lie about her
name and where she lives?

17:44.437 --> 17:46.238
Maybe she has a boyfriend?

17:47.708 --> 17:50.309
- Are you going to tell Emmett?
- No, no way.

17:50.410 --> 17:52.578
He is already pissed.

17:53.881 --> 17:56.248
I gotta find out more
before I say anything.

17:56.349 --> 17:58.450
Well, it looks like we're staking out

17:58.552 --> 18:00.452
cheerleader practice at Heyward tomorrow.

18:00.554 --> 18:02.021
(Laughs)

18:06.217 --> 18:08.151
Regina: Hey, Juanita.

18:08.252 --> 18:11.153
- Hi.
- I'm not here on business.

18:12.389 --> 18:14.390
These need some serious work.

18:14.491 --> 18:17.026
All right. Let's find you a color.

18:18.428 --> 18:19.996
Hmmm.

18:21.498 --> 18:23.699
I'm really gonna be sad
to see this place go.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.568
- Really?
- Really.

18:26.603 --> 18:28.370
Um...

18:31.607 --> 18:33.575
If you...

18:33.676 --> 18:36.011
Don't mind my asking, have
you signed anything yet?

18:36.112 --> 18:39.448
No. When I saw you, I
thought maybe you're...

18:39.549 --> 18:41.850
Like I said, I'm not here on business.

18:41.951 --> 18:44.319
Though if I were the owner of this place,

18:44.421 --> 18:46.455
I'd want to make sure
I got my money's worth.

18:46.556 --> 18:49.525
Have it appraised, get a
lawyer to look at the contract.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.260
- Would you?
- Just to cover my bases.

18:52.361 --> 18:55.196
After all, value is subjective.

18:55.297 --> 18:57.998
For all I know, your salon
could be worth a whole lot more

18:58.100 --> 19:00.601
- than what they're offering.
- Huh.

19:00.702 --> 19:04.038
- Interesting.
- I mean, that's just me.

19:04.139 --> 19:05.940
Off the record, of course.

19:06.041 --> 19:08.109
Of course.

19:09.211 --> 19:11.546
How about... this?

19:11.646 --> 19:13.448
Perfect.

19:21.689 --> 19:24.491
- Angelo.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

19:24.592 --> 19:27.194
(Sighs) It's okay. Thanks for coming over.

19:27.295 --> 19:29.129
You want a brownie?

19:30.131 --> 19:31.864
Yes, please!

19:33.634 --> 19:34.801
Thanks.

19:38.472 --> 19:39.938
What's going on?

19:40.039 --> 19:42.441
Um, I was wondering

19:42.542 --> 19:45.043
if maybe I could come work at
the restaurant once it's open?

19:45.145 --> 19:46.312
I would love it.

19:47.547 --> 19:49.181
But what about medicine?

19:49.282 --> 19:50.882
I thought you loved the clinic.

19:52.119 --> 19:55.087
- (Sighs)
- Daphne, what's going on?

19:55.188 --> 19:58.790
You have to promise that you're
not going to go punch somebody out.

19:58.891 --> 20:00.759
I promise.

20:00.860 --> 20:04.563
One of the guys who
attacked me on the food truck

20:04.664 --> 20:07.099
came into the clinic for treatment.

20:07.199 --> 20:11.003
- Did he hurt you?
- No, not at all. He didn't even remember me.

20:13.272 --> 20:16.174
I just don't ever want to...

20:16.275 --> 20:19.077
see him or think about him ever again.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.113
Of course. You shouldn't have to.

20:21.213 --> 20:23.148
It just got me thinking...

20:23.249 --> 20:26.118
maybe I'm not cut out for medicine.

20:27.787 --> 20:31.189
You know, if I had to work on a...

20:31.290 --> 20:32.958
rapist or a murderer,

20:33.059 --> 20:34.993
I... I don't think I could do that.

20:39.330 --> 20:41.098
And besides,

20:41.199 --> 20:43.801
cooking's always been what I love, so...

20:46.938 --> 20:49.006
Okay, the job is yours.

20:50.475 --> 20:52.143
Thanks.

20:58.150 --> 21:00.017
Hey, I gotta get going pretty soon.

21:00.118 --> 21:02.920
There's this one brother who is trying
to use the last couple weeks of pledging

21:03.021 --> 21:05.389
to get us to clean his room,
do a bunch of his homework.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.824
(Sighs) I cannot wait till I'm a brother...

21:07.925 --> 21:10.627
and I can do that to some
other pathetic pledge. (Laughs)

21:10.728 --> 21:13.230
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

21:13.261 --> 21:15.662
Doesn't it bother you that these guys

21:15.763 --> 21:19.065
who are supposed to be your
friends didn't stand up for you?

21:19.167 --> 21:22.269
Well, I did break the rules by
telling you about that thing.

21:22.370 --> 21:25.071
Okay, but they know you

21:25.173 --> 21:27.039
and they know what a great guy you are.

21:27.141 --> 21:30.109
You're clearly dedicated to
the place, like to the core.

21:30.210 --> 21:32.378
So you told one person about a party

21:32.479 --> 21:34.913
that never should've
happened in the first place?

21:35.015 --> 21:38.151
And after everything you've gone
through with your pledge brothers...

21:38.252 --> 21:40.586
the bowling balls, the keg
stands, cleaning toilets,

21:40.687 --> 21:43.222
who knows what else... shouldn't
they have stood up for you

21:43.323 --> 21:46.159
and said, "if he goes, we go"?

21:46.260 --> 21:48.293
Why are you always
dumping on my fraternity?

21:48.394 --> 21:50.529
- I'm not. I just...
- No, these guys have gone through a lot

21:50.630 --> 21:52.997
and they don't want to jeopardize
themselves either, which I understand.

21:53.098 --> 21:56.334
I just don't get why you want to
be a part of that stupid world.

21:56.435 --> 21:59.003
You're better than them. Ever
since I walked into that house

21:59.104 --> 22:01.173
and that one guy was trying
to sleep with me... Ledge...

22:01.274 --> 22:02.740
- Cliff!
- Whoever!

22:02.841 --> 22:04.742
-
-Every interaction that I've had with them

22:04.843 --> 22:06.878
has made me wonder why
you want to be part of it.

22:06.979 --> 22:10.548
I'm sitting here, helping you stake
out your ex-boyfriend's girlfriend.

22:10.649 --> 22:12.984
What am I doing? Why do
I keep doing these things

22:13.085 --> 22:15.219
- for someone who clearly thinks I'm a complete idiot?
- Tank!

22:15.320 --> 22:16.921
I don't think...

22:17.022 --> 22:18.556
(sighs)

22:22.561 --> 22:24.862
Kathryn: You told Toby
he could move back home?!

22:24.963 --> 22:27.198
Of course I did, sweetie.
He's a mess, he needs us now.

22:27.299 --> 22:29.700
(Sighs) Do you really think

22:29.801 --> 22:32.468
- that's the best thing for him?
- I absolutely ag...

22:32.570 --> 22:34.504
Hey, we still keep the
passports in the study, right?

22:34.605 --> 22:36.472
Uh, yeah, the...

22:37.774 --> 22:40.210
Toby, is everything okay? Honey?

22:41.878 --> 22:44.880
I was sitting in my apartment
alone, feeling sorry for myself,

22:44.981 --> 22:46.649
and then I remembered what you said.

22:46.750 --> 22:49.552
- What'd I say?
- That I need to give it my all.

22:49.653 --> 22:51.954
I'm going to Peru! I'm going after her!

22:52.055 --> 22:53.623
Wait a second. I never said anything...

22:53.724 --> 22:56.958
The only reason that we broke
up was because of circumstances.

22:57.059 --> 22:59.094
I can change those circumstances.

22:59.195 --> 23:01.896
- What are you going to do there?
- I'm gonna be her husband!

23:01.932 --> 23:05.001
I love Nikki and... I'm Christian enough.

23:05.102 --> 23:08.071
And I can save my marriage and
help people at the same time.

23:08.173 --> 23:10.740
Don't try to talk me
out of this. I'm happy.

23:11.742 --> 23:13.177
I gotta get a typhoid shot.

23:15.079 --> 23:16.680
Love you!

23:18.249 --> 23:20.484
- I thought you said he was depressed.
- He was!

23:20.585 --> 23:23.053
- We gotta stop him.
- Last time we tried that,

23:23.154 --> 23:25.989
he ignored us and went off and got married.

23:26.090 --> 23:28.958
Yesterday you accused me of not
playing fair in east riverside.

23:29.060 --> 23:31.094
Well, today Juanita Perez
and three other owners

23:31.195 --> 23:33.730
suddenly lawyer up, asking
for a ton more money.

23:33.831 --> 23:36.199
Getting a lawyer involved is good business.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.068
Well, biting the hand
that feeds you is not.

23:39.269 --> 23:41.004
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:41.105 --> 23:44.273
Spare me the B.S. I'm rescinding
all unsigned contracts,

23:44.374 --> 23:46.542
and offering 10% less
than what I did before.

23:46.643 --> 23:48.178
- What?
- And they have you to thank.

23:48.278 --> 23:49.545
Of course now it'll look

23:49.646 --> 23:51.613
like you're the one playing
people off each other.

23:51.715 --> 23:53.782
Wes, please, do what you
want to me, but don't...

23:53.883 --> 23:55.851
Don't worry, I got big plans for you.

23:55.952 --> 23:58.453
First, I'm going to be suing
for breach of fiduciary duty.

23:58.554 --> 24:01.757
You took what I said in confidence
and you used it against me...

24:01.858 --> 24:03.926
You played dirty, I played dirty.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.460
Uh-huh.

24:07.597 --> 24:09.564
Jess, call security,

24:09.665 --> 24:12.567
have them escort Ms.
Vasquez from the building.

24:12.668 --> 24:13.901
You're fired, of course.

24:14.002 --> 24:15.469
Oh, and I want my car back.

24:15.570 --> 24:17.972
- Of course.
- And I expect a cashier's check

24:18.073 --> 24:21.475
for the balance of your salary advance
by the end of the business day tomorrow.

24:27.324 --> 24:28.024
Hi.

24:31.029 --> 24:32.362
(Sighs)

24:32.463 --> 24:34.331
I am so so sorry.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.868
I shouldn't have accused you of that.

24:39.070 --> 24:41.137
It was awful of me.

24:42.239 --> 24:43.640
How's your friend?

24:43.741 --> 24:45.608
He's hanging in there.

24:47.478 --> 24:50.747
Do you wanna blow off class and go eat
a cinnamon roll the size of your face?

24:50.848 --> 24:52.449
Yes!

24:54.151 --> 24:55.585
Yes.

24:57.955 --> 25:01.557
My son's running off to Peru
to be with his child bride

25:01.658 --> 25:04.226
- and now my book's dead.
- What do you mean your book's dead?

25:04.327 --> 25:06.027
- You read the review.
- (Scoffs)

25:06.128 --> 25:09.097
That review was written
by some wannabe writer

25:09.198 --> 25:13.301
with her own unfinished herotica
gathering dust in some drawer somewhere.

25:13.403 --> 25:15.738
You should wear that review
like a badge of honor.

25:15.839 --> 25:20.108
Kathryn, what's the worst thing
that can happen with this thing?

25:20.209 --> 25:22.977
It bombs. My name is
dragged through the mud.

25:23.078 --> 25:25.179
- I'll be humiliated.
- So?

25:26.281 --> 25:27.415
That's easy for you to say.

25:27.516 --> 25:29.484
You're not putting yourself
out there like this.

25:29.585 --> 25:31.018
Are you kidding me?

25:31.119 --> 25:34.054
What do you think it was like
coming out to my super Catholic

25:34.155 --> 25:36.223
Filipina mother 20 years ago?

25:36.324 --> 25:40.561
Or my grandmother? No one in my
family was giving me pats on the back

25:40.662 --> 25:42.462
for that announcement, trust me.

25:42.563 --> 25:45.164
But if I lived my life
worrying about everyone

25:45.266 --> 25:48.134
approving of everything I
did, I'd never leave the house.

25:48.235 --> 25:50.670
- But everyone loves you.
- Ehh.

25:50.772 --> 25:53.086
- What?
- You think I don't know

25:53.090 --> 25:55.308
your husband flinched the
first time we shook hands?

25:56.844 --> 25:58.945
John's come a long way since then.

25:59.046 --> 26:02.816
Yes, he has, but the
point is it doesn't matter.

26:02.917 --> 26:05.985
This is me. If it makes
other people uncomfortable,

26:06.086 --> 26:08.021
that's their problem.

26:08.122 --> 26:10.223
- I wish I could be more like that.
- You can.

26:10.324 --> 26:12.191
So your book bombs?

26:12.293 --> 26:14.760
Big deal! You tried something!

26:14.861 --> 26:18.131
Unless you want to climb
back on that safe little boat

26:18.232 --> 26:21.334
- I found you on.
- No.

26:21.435 --> 26:23.102
I don't.

26:26.472 --> 26:29.574
You didn't want me working for Wes to
begin with. I thought you'd be happy!

26:29.675 --> 26:32.744
Happy? I'm up to my ears
with bills for the restaurant

26:32.845 --> 26:36.214
and now you owe 50 grand?!
You have that kind of money?

26:36.316 --> 26:38.250
Because if you expect me to bail you out...

26:38.351 --> 26:40.953
Don't worry, I will figure it out myself,

26:41.054 --> 26:42.887
- just like I always have.
- How?

26:42.989 --> 26:46.324
Dig up new business, liquidate
assets. Anything is better

26:46.425 --> 26:48.359
than working for that lying son of a bitch.

26:48.461 --> 26:51.162
Do you think working for
Christy is a piece of cake?

26:51.263 --> 26:53.465
She's all over my ass every day!

26:53.566 --> 26:57.535
But I take it for the sake of
building a better future for us.

26:58.838 --> 27:01.339
Angelo, this is not about money,

27:01.440 --> 27:03.942
- my integrity was on the line.
- Can your integrity pay our bills?

27:04.042 --> 27:06.910
I am not getting my job back.

27:07.011 --> 27:08.679
End of story.

Uh, hi, excuse me. Hi.

28:16.746 --> 28:20.849
This is a weird question,
but are you Mandy?

28:20.950 --> 28:23.885
Or do you ever go by Mandy

28:23.986 --> 28:26.387
or do you know a Mandy?

28:26.488 --> 28:28.756
Why are you doing that?

28:28.857 --> 28:31.659
- You're not deaf.
- No.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.295
- And your name isn't Mandy.
- Nope.

28:34.396 --> 28:36.130
Uh, sorry.

28:36.231 --> 28:39.367
- Do you know a guy named Emmett Bledsoe?
- No again.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.936
Uh, it's just there's this guy, my friend,

28:42.037 --> 28:44.337
he thinks he's in a relationship with you

28:44.439 --> 28:46.806
and that your name is Mandy starling

28:46.907 --> 28:49.509
and that you're deaf and live in Seattle.

28:49.610 --> 28:51.244
This is getting a little creepy.

28:53.013 --> 28:56.383
I'm so sorry I've clearly
made a huge mistake.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.784
Yep.

29:01.122 --> 29:03.690
(Sighs) My cousin's deaf.

29:03.791 --> 29:05.658
Maybe they know each other.

29:06.659 --> 29:07.826

I need a doctor!

I'll... uh...

30:07.718 --> 30:09.186
let me find one.

30:17.517 --> 30:19.351
He's back.

30:21.554 --> 30:23.255
- Where does it hurt?
- My stomach.

30:23.356 --> 30:25.623
- Are you on anything?
- Man, I'm trying to quit.

30:25.725 --> 30:28.459

- (Groans) Yesterday.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.461
Find me an exam room.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.064
- Okay, come on, come on.
- (Groaning)

30:33.165 --> 30:35.366
- Oh my God!
- Excuse me.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.403
Exam one's open!

30:39.504 --> 30:41.672
- (Hissing)
- Just walk with me, walk with me.

30:41.774 --> 30:44.075
Breathe. Breathe. You're doing great.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.844
- Sit down, lay your head, lay your head.
- (Moaning)

30:46.945 --> 30:49.213
Okay, okay. Relax, relax.
I need you to hold still.

30:49.313 --> 30:51.782
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.
- What's wrong with him?

30:51.883 --> 30:53.683
Heroin withdrawal. He quit cold turkey,

30:53.785 --> 30:55.919
- now he's dehydrated.
- Oh God, make it stop!

30:56.020 --> 30:58.088
Okay okay, he needs an I.V.

30:58.189 --> 30:59.857
Find me someone to assist.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.359
- Ow, please help me!
- Breathe.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.694
Okay, breathe.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.463
I'll do it.

31:07.765 --> 31:08.965
You sure?

31:09.066 --> 31:11.834
- (Wheezing)
- Okay, hold his left arm still.

31:11.935 --> 31:14.504
(Sobbing)

31:22.846 --> 31:25.482
Adam, you need to calm
down so we can help you.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.620
- (Groans)
- All right, he's still moving too much.

31:32.923 --> 31:35.357
Adam, look at me. Look at me!

31:38.829 --> 31:40.163
Just focus on me, okay?

31:59.348 --> 32:02.050
- You can let go.
- Thanks.

32:15.864 --> 32:18.165
- Honey, hi.
- Hey.

32:18.266 --> 32:21.902
So Peru's a long flight. I
thought you might need this.

32:22.003 --> 32:23.704
Thanks.

32:23.740 --> 32:27.209
You know, you can get a lot more
in if you actually fold them.

32:27.310 --> 32:30.479
I don't have time to fold.
My flight's in six hours

32:30.580 --> 32:33.315
and I still have to go to
the currency exchange place

32:33.416 --> 32:36.418
to get peso or nuevos or
whatever they call them in Peru.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.988
- Wait, you're leaving tonight?
- Yeah, it's the only flight I could get.

32:41.724 --> 32:43.659
Honey, please, stop.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.060
Please take a day. Think about it.

32:46.162 --> 32:47.596
I don't need to think about it.

32:47.697 --> 32:49.931
I made a commitment to Nikki.

32:50.032 --> 32:52.767
We exchanged vows. I have to go.

32:53.935 --> 32:55.969
You of all people should understand that.

32:56.070 --> 32:57.705
I do understand.

32:57.806 --> 33:00.007
I followed your father around for 20 years

33:00.108 --> 33:01.542
and then one day I woke up and realized

33:01.643 --> 33:03.344
that I had completely lost myself.

33:03.445 --> 33:08.316
If you follow Nikki to Peru because
that is the only way to keep her,

33:08.417 --> 33:11.385
you're gonna resent her.

33:17.826 --> 33:19.559
(Sighs)

33:25.867 --> 33:30.037
I can't spend my life working at a car wash

33:30.138 --> 33:34.074
to come home to a sad little apartment

33:34.175 --> 33:37.811
that I was supposed to share with my wife.

33:37.912 --> 33:40.179
That's just fear talking.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.849
That is not a reason to go.

33:44.184 --> 33:45.819
Then what am I supposed to do now?

33:47.287 --> 33:49.021
I don't know, honey.

33:49.122 --> 33:52.158
Anything. Everything.

33:52.259 --> 33:56.496
You have your whole life ahead
of you. You're so amazing.

33:56.597 --> 33:59.566
And there's one thing I know,

33:59.667 --> 34:02.669
when a door closes,

34:02.770 --> 34:05.572
a window opens.

34:07.174 --> 34:09.574
You just gotta find that window.

34:33.614 --> 34:34.911
_

34:40.273 --> 34:41.505
(Grunts)

34:55.550 --> 34:58.949
_

35:00.360 --> 35:03.675
_

35:03.676 --> 35:05.345
_

35:07.150 --> 35:09.190
_

35:09.191 --> 35:11.860
_

35:53.743 --> 35:56.018
<i>But I just bought it, four hours ago...</i>

35:56.151 --> 35:57.445
why can't I just get a refund?

35:58.822 --> 36:02.258
Yes, I understand what the
term "non-refundable" means,

36:02.359 --> 36:05.061
which is crazy because I
just spent over two grand!

36:07.198 --> 36:08.531
Okay, fine.

36:09.766 --> 36:12.034
What are my options?

36:16.840 --> 36:19.474
- How is he?
- He's resting.

36:21.978 --> 36:24.513
- How are you?
- Okay.

36:24.614 --> 36:27.216
You were really brave in there.

36:28.651 --> 36:30.686
I was so scared,

36:30.787 --> 36:33.089
but then something changed.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.590
I guess I just saw him as a...

36:36.592 --> 36:38.193
person.

36:38.293 --> 36:40.261
You're going to be a great doctor.

36:41.663 --> 36:43.098
Thank you.

36:45.601 --> 36:47.401
Kathryn: That was Lydia.

36:47.502 --> 36:50.105
You're not gonna believe
this. She leaked my book.

36:50.206 --> 36:52.807
- Your editor? Why?
- Publicity.

36:52.908 --> 36:55.944
(Laughs) Apparently I'm
trending through the roof.

36:56.045 --> 36:58.546
Talk shows are calling for interviews.

36:58.647 --> 37:00.914
They're negotiating
with "Sports Illustrated"

37:01.015 --> 37:03.651
- to print more excerpts of my book.
- (Mildly) Wow.

37:03.752 --> 37:05.986
She says I'm in for the ride of my life.

37:08.189 --> 37:10.691
- Aren't you excited, honey?
- Yeah, of course I am.

37:10.792 --> 37:14.228
It's just that Toby left us this
note on his way to the airport.

37:15.764 --> 37:17.865
- He's going to Peru?
- Nope.

37:17.966 --> 37:20.200
- Iceland.
- Iceland?

37:20.302 --> 37:22.069
What the hell is he doing?

37:24.406 --> 37:25.939
He found a window.

37:27.341 --> 37:29.509
Daphne: I'm just glad
to finally be past it.

37:29.610 --> 37:32.079
- I'm proud of you, sweetie.
- Thanks.

37:32.180 --> 37:36.016
There's still Angelo's
job offer to consider.

37:36.117 --> 37:38.886
It's a great opportunity, but...

37:38.987 --> 37:40.888
- You want to be a doctor.
- Yeah.

37:40.989 --> 37:42.355
Do you think he'll be upset?

37:42.456 --> 37:44.892
To have a doctor in the
family? He'll be over the moon.

37:44.993 --> 37:47.460
(Laughs) I'm proud of you too.

37:47.561 --> 37:49.596
- Me?
- How hard you've been working,

37:49.697 --> 37:51.164
helping out the old neighborhood.

37:51.265 --> 37:54.967
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you...

38:00.574 --> 38:03.176
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

38:10.384 --> 38:11.717
Oh my God.

38:13.980 --> 38:15.918
_

38:25.832 --> 38:27.833

38:29.336 --> 38:30.869
Okay, uh...

38:30.970 --> 38:32.236
"Rivas Canyon trail."

38:32.338 --> 38:34.372
Two miles to the branch.

38:35.607 --> 38:37.241
Thank you, Travis.

38:54.325 --> 38:56.760

38:56.861 --> 38:58.462
Hi.

38:58.563 --> 39:01.130
Hey, um,

39:01.232 --> 39:04.434
I just... I wanted to...

39:06.604 --> 39:08.905
I just depledged my fraternity.

39:09.006 --> 39:11.742
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, um...

39:11.843 --> 39:14.042
I haven't told anyone yet. I just...

39:14.143 --> 39:16.311
- I wanted you to know.
- Wow.

39:16.413 --> 39:19.047
Yeah, everything Bay said
just started to sink in

39:19.148 --> 39:22.317
and, um, uh...

39:22.419 --> 39:25.153
- I'm still kind of in shock.
- I'm sure.

39:25.255 --> 39:27.189
Hey, can you not tell Bay? I want to do it.

39:27.290 --> 39:29.925
Of course. Absolutely.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.262
(Laughs)

39:38.768 --> 39:40.368
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:40.469 --> 39:42.670
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

39:42.772 --> 39:44.439
(Exhales)

39:55.618 --> 39:57.752
Emmett, oh my God! What...

39:57.853 --> 39:59.686
what happened? Wh...

39:59.788 --> 40:01.855
what did he do to you?

40:01.877 --> 40:04.725
Are you okay? Didn't
you get any of my texts?

40:07.806 --> 40:10.780
_

40:10.785 --> 40:12.967
Because he's sick, Emmett.

40:13.068 --> 40:16.938
He is a sick person to do that.

40:16.939 --> 40:19.434
_

40:19.435 --> 40:24.477
_

40:24.980 --> 40:26.113
Who cares?

40:27.144 --> 40:30.260
_

40:32.861 --> 40:34.420
_

40:35.481 --> 40:37.071
_

40:37.124 --> 40:38.591
So what?

40:38.692 --> 40:41.861
You are Emmett Bledsoe.
Everybody loves you.

40:47.620 --> 40:49.431
_

40:56.410 --> 41:00.080
You came here looking for some other girl.

41:00.581 --> 41:06.902
_

41:09.505 --> 41:12.133
_

41:13.504 --> 41:15.081
_

41:17.800 --> 41:23.322
_

41:24.237 --> 41:26.372
<i>* I gathered up... *</i>

41:26.473 --> 41:29.108
You know

41:29.209 --> 41:30.676
I love you.

41:30.777 --> 41:33.312
<i>* built a wall... *</i>

41:33.413 --> 41:36.181
I never stopped.

41:37.918 --> 41:40.853
<i>* but they walk through walls *</i>

41:40.954 --> 41:43.689
<i>* and I'm trapped inside *</i>

41:45.592 --> 41:47.326
<i>* oh ho *</i>

41:49.095 --> 41:52.231
<i>* oh-ho oh *</i>

41:52.332 --> 41:56.701
<i>* oh, where there's
shadow, there is light *</i>

41:56.802 --> 42:00.704
<i>* love is in the battle cry *</i>

42:00.805 --> 42:03.874
<i>* even in the darkest night *</i>

42:03.975 --> 42:07.778
<i>* there is shadow, there is light *</i>

42:07.879 --> 42:10.981
<i>* hold your heart up to the fire *</i>

42:11.082 --> 42:14.885
<i>* walk across the razor wire *</i>

42:14.986 --> 42:18.121
<i>* even in the cruelest fight *</i>

42:18.222 --> 42:21.525
<i>* love is in the battle cry *</i>

42:21.626 --> 42:25.828
<i>* love is in the battle cry</i>

42:31.268 --> 42:33.369
<i>* oh ho *</i>

42:34.838 --> 42:37.907
<i>* oh-ho oh *</i>

42:38.008 --> 42:40.443
<i>* oh ho. *</i>
