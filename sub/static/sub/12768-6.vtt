WILLIAM HIRED ME
TWO WEEKS AGO.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.875
YOU SHOULD KEEP UP
WITH YOUR OFFICE E-MAILS.
I DIDN'T GET AN E-MAIL

02:17.917 --> 02:20.875
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
WHO'S IN CHARGE OF HIRING.
WILLIAM THOUGHT
WE'D BE GOOD TOGETHER,

02:20.917 --> 02:22.709
PROFESSIONALLY SPEAKING.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.917
I'VE DESIGNED A TECHNIQUE
THAT IMPROVES THE SUCCESS RATE

02:24.959 --> 02:27.917
FOR COMPLEX IMPLANTATIONS
IN VARIOUS HIGH-RISK GROUPS.
WHAT TECHNIQUES?
WHAT HIGH-RISK GROUPS?

02:27.959 --> 02:29.917
MEET THE DONOVANS--
CURTIS AND SALLY.

02:29.959 --> 02:33.333

A DWARF BABY.

02:35.667 --> 02:42.375

GIVE IT TO THEM.

02:42.417 --> 02:44.375
(Sally) DR. FIFE'S
BEEN A GODSEND.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.917
WE'VE WANTED CHILDREN
FOR SO LONG.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.792
BUT A CHILD LIKE US.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.500
WITHOUT SELECTION,
THERE'S ABOUT A 50% CHANCE

02:51.542 --> 02:54.834
THEY'LL HAVE A DWARF BABY,
BUT WITH EMBRYO SELECTION

02:54.875 --> 02:56.834
AND ISOLATING
THE F.G.F.R.3 MUTATION,

02:56.875 --> 02:58.959

02:59.000 --> 03:00.709
YOU GUARANTEED IT?

03:00.750 --> 03:04.583
I KNOW IT'S ODD
TO SOME PEOPLE,

03:04.625 --> 03:08.083
PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS
AS A DEFORMITY OR A DISABILITY.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.625
BUT IT'S US.
IT'S WHO WE ARE.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.792
SO WHEN DR. FIFE TOLD US
ABOUT YOU...

03:13.834 --> 03:16.875
(Sally) WE ARE SO GRATEFUL
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE US A BABY,

03:16.917 --> 03:19.041

03:19.083 --> 03:21.875

03:38.166 --> 03:40.583
I KNOW WE JUST MET,

03:40.625 --> 03:42.792
BUT I THINK
YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

03:42.834 --> 03:44.792
YOU DON'T EXACTLY
EXUDE THE CONFIDENCE

03:44.834 --> 03:47.041
MOST PEOPLE EXPECT
FROM THEIR DOCTOR.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.417
CONFIDENCE?
JUST TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.
NO HARM DONE.

03:49.458 --> 03:52.834
TELL ME. WHAT CAN I DO
TO EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS?

03:52.875 --> 03:56.000
UM, I JUST MET YOU
FIVE MINUTES AGO...
MM-HMM.

03:56.041 --> 03:58.250
AND I HAVEN'T AGREED
TO DO ANY OF THIS.

03:58.291 --> 04:02.041
I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH
THE IDEA OF DESIGNER BABIES,

04:02.083 --> 04:03.917
AND FRANKLY,
YOU SAY YOU WORK HERE,

04:03.959 --> 04:06.375

THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN.

04:06.417 --> 04:08.417
WILLIAM WHITE HIRED ME

04:08.458 --> 04:11.041
THIS IS HIS PRACTICE.
THIS IS MY PRACTICE.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.041
THEN YOU OUGHT TO READ
YOUR E-MAILS.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.834
I'LL SCHEDULE THE IMPLANTATION
FOR TOMORROW.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.000
NICE MEETING YOU.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.041
THERE WAS NO E-MAIL.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.709

I CAN'T TALK TODAY.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.250
NO, YOU NEED TO SEE HER.

04:38.333 --> 04:41.291

JIMMY HAD TO DRAG ME.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.291
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU GOT HERE.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.458
YOU DID YOUR BIOFEEDBACK.
(voice breaks)
I DON'T FEEL BETTER.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.250
WHICH IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO GO UPSTAIRS,

04:49.291 --> 04:52.000
SO THE THERAPIES
CAN WORK IN CONCERT.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.000
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP,

04:54.041 --> 04:56.000
AND I KNOW
EVERYONE'S TRYING TO HELP,

04:56.041 --> 04:59.041
I JUST... (crying) I'M DONE.
I WANT TO DIE.

04:59.083 --> 05:02.041
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU PEOPLE
WON'T JUST LET ME KILL MYSELF

05:02.083 --> 05:06.291

FEELING LIKE THIS.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.041
(sobbing)

05:09.083 --> 05:11.667
SO I SAID TO HIM,
"YOU DO SMELL, BAD."

05:11.709 --> 05:14.667
YOU SAID THAT
TO THE PATIENT?
YEAH, I'M SAYING
WHAT I THINK.

05:14.709 --> 05:16.667
IT'S FREEING.
I'M TELLING THEM WHAT I THINK.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.041
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY LIKE IT.
OKAY.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.709
HEY, HEY.
ANYBODY WANT A CAT?
WHOA.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.208
A TEMPORARY--
TEMPORARY CAT.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.041
NICE PUSSY.

05:25.083 --> 05:27.208
OH, DON'T BE CHILDISH.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CAT.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.709
IT'S NOT MINE.
IT'S MY PATIENT'S.
OKAY.
WELL, JUST BE CAREFUL.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.417
SINGLE WOMAN, LIVING ALONE--
FIRST IT'S ONE CAT,

05:33.458 --> 05:35.417
THEN YOU'RE STAYING HOME FRIDAY
NIGHTS WATCHING CHICK FLICKS.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.375
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE LIVING

05:37.417 --> 05:40.375
WITH NINE CATS
AND A BIRD.
IT'S NOT MINE.

05:40.417 --> 05:43.041
WHY IS CATWOMAN SO SEXY,
BUT A WOMAN WITH CATS--

05:43.083 --> 05:44.834
SO NOT.
I THINK
YOU SHOULD KEEP THE CAT.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.041
I THINK
IT'S A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

05:47.083 --> 05:50.375
FOR SOMEONE WITH COMMITMENT
ISSUES TO WORK THROUGH THEM.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.750
I'M SAYING WHAT I THINK.
IT'S FREEING.

05:53.792 --> 05:57.000
VIOLET, I AM GLAD THAT YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER. I AM.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.166
BUT, UH, I DO NOT HAVE
COMMITMENT ISSUES.

05:59.208 --> 06:02.417
HEY, CHARLOTTE.
I BET, UH, YOU LIKE CATS.

06:02.458 --> 06:05.041
I'M ALLERGIC. I JUST WANTED
TO GIVE YOU LADIES

06:05.083 --> 06:08.041
A LITTLE "THANKS FOR WELCOMING
ME TO THE PRACTICE" GIFT.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.875
I JUST GOT 'EM.
PLEASE. NOT IN FRONT OF THE...

06:10.917 --> 06:12.333
CAT.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.041
(exhales)

06:14.083 --> 06:16.041
CAT SITTERS, L.A.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.000
CATS DON'T NEED A SITTER.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.041
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HAD
A PET BEFORE?

06:20.083 --> 06:23.041
YEAH, WE HAD HORSES...
WITH TRAINERS AND RIDERS.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.041
OH, AND I HAD
A PET HERMIT CRAB ONCE.

06:26.083 --> 06:29.041
BUT THE AIR FILTER WAS
VERY NOISY, SO I SHUT IT OFF,

06:29.083 --> 06:31.625
AND HE DIED.
(footsteps approach)

06:31.667 --> 06:34.375
I'M ESCAPING.
ESCAPING WHO?

06:34.417 --> 06:37.083
MY NEW DIRECTOR
OF GENETIC RESEARCH.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.625
OOH. IMPRESSIVE. YOU GUYS
ARE GOING HIGH-TECH.

06:39.667 --> 06:43.041
WILLIAM IS. HE HIRED HIM...
BEHIND MY BACK.

06:43.083 --> 06:47.041
WAIT. AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE?
YES, I AM.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.041
IS HE GOOD?

06:49.083 --> 06:51.041
HE'S BRILLIANT,
AND--AND HE'S KNOW IT.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.041
AND HE'S ARROGANT
AND HE'S RUDE

06:53.083 --> 06:55.250
AND... HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.875
OH.
AND HIS PATIENTS
ARE LITTLE PEOPLE.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.500
OH.
AND THEY WANT TO DO
A SELECTIVE IMPLANTATION.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.041
THEY WANT A LITTLE BABY.

07:02.083 --> 07:05.291
I, UH, I GUESS THAT LEAVES YOU
WITH A SMALL PROBLEM.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.709
(chuckles)
DON'T ACT LIKE
YOU WEREN'T THINKING IT.

07:08.750 --> 07:12.041
WELL, YOU'RE IN CHARGE, NAI.
YES, I AM. I AM.

07:12.083 --> 07:16.041
AND GENETIC SELECTION
IS A LINE THAT I WON'T CROSS.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.083
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
YOU JUST STAND TALL.

07:18.125 --> 07:21.125
(snickers and laughs)

07:21.166 --> 07:24.125
I GOTTA GO FIND COOPER.
HE'LL LAUGH WITH ME.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.041
(laughs)

07:26.083 --> 07:28.542
WHY IS THERE A CAT IN HERE?

07:28.583 --> 07:30.291
(sighs)

07:30.333 --> 07:32.291
SO IF THE SNOT TURNS GREEN,

07:32.333 --> 07:35.041
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR MOM
CALL ME, RIGHT?

07:35.083 --> 07:37.041
YES. ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME FIVE.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.333
GET OUTTA HERE.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.041
HIS FEVER SPIKES, CALL ME,
BUT OTHERWISE, HE'S FINE.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.458
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.083
PROBLEM?

07:45.125 --> 07:47.083
ADDISON OR SAM
GIVING YOU A HARD TIME?

07:47.125 --> 07:49.083
YOU NEED ME
TO BEAT SOMEBODY UP--

07:49.125 --> 07:50.875
AN O.W.G. SMACKDOWN?

07:50.917 --> 07:52.083
NO PATIENTS.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.083
OH, WELL,
THEY'LL GROW TO LIKE YOU.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.083
YOU'RE AN ACQUIRED TASTE.
I DID.

07:56.125 --> 07:59.041
NO PATIENTS, COOPER.
NO PEOPLE PATIENTS.

07:59.083 --> 08:02.041
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS,
AND MY PRACTICE IS BOMBING.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.041
IT'S EMBARRASSING.
CHARLOTTE--

08:04.083 --> 08:07.041
COOPER, YOU GOT A BOATLOAD
OF LITTLE SNOTTY-HEAD KIDS.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.041
GO DOCTOR 'EM WHILE I FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M DOING WRONG.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.041
I WATCH HER ALL THE TIME.

08:12.083 --> 08:15.625
I... I DON'T EVEN KEEP A RAZOR
IN MY BATHROOM BECAUSE...

08:15.667 --> 08:17.125
I WATCH HER,

08:17.166 --> 08:19.333
BUT SHE STOPPED EATING.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.333
BARBARA'S NEVER GETTING BETTER,
IS SHE?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.333
JIMMY, DEPRESSION IS TOUGH
TO BREAK,

08:23.375 --> 08:26.041
AND TREATMENT IS NOT FAST.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.041
YEAH, IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR.

08:28.083 --> 08:31.750
I MEAN, SHE NURSED HER FATHER,
WE CANCELED THE WEDDING...

08:31.792 --> 08:34.959
I LOVE HER, PETE.
I NEED HER BETTER.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.333
OH, HEY. ARE YOU GOING UP
FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT?

08:38.375 --> 08:41.750
NO, I'M... I'M TIRED
OF ALL THE TALKING.

08:41.792 --> 08:45.000
I'M TIRED OF ALL THE PILLS.
UM, IT'S NOT WORKING.
BARBARA--

08:45.041 --> 08:46.250
JIMMY...

08:46.291 --> 08:49.166
BARBARA MADE A DECISION.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.166
WHAT DECISION?
DR. TURNER HAS A WAY

08:51.208 --> 08:55.041
FOR ME TO GET BETTER,
TO FEEL HAPPY AGAIN NOW.

08:55.083 --> 08:59.250
I'M GONNA DO
ELECTRIC SHOCK THERAPY.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.041
THIS IS NOT THE TREATMENT
WE AGREED ON.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.041
WELL, THE TREATMENT
WE AGREED ON ISN'T WORKING.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.041
SHE NEEDS A SHOCK
TO THE SYSTEM, LITERALLY.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.041
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:13.083 --> 09:14.875
MY--MY JOB.

09:14.917 --> 09:16.875
I'M ADAPTING
TO BARBARA'S SITUATION.

09:16.917 --> 09:18.834
I'M ALTERING COURSE.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.834
BY SENDING ELECTRICAL CURRENT
THROUGH OUR PATIENT'S BRAIN

09:20.875 --> 09:22.041
AND INDUCING A SEIZURE?

09:22.083 --> 09:23.834
THAT'S A LAST RESORT.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.041
IT'S NOT "CUCKOO'S NEST."

09:25.083 --> 09:27.834
THERE'S NO HOLDING HER DOWN,
FROTHING AT THE MOUTH.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.834
SHE'S NOT GONNA FEEL A THING.

09:29.875 --> 09:31.834
IT IS ACCEPTED TREATMENT.
SHE IS DESPERATE.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.834
SHE WANTS TO BE BETTER,
SHE WANTS TO BE BETTER NOW,

09:34.875 --> 09:37.834
AND I CAN GIVE THAT TO HER.
E.C.T. IS NOT A MAGIC BULLET,
AND THIS IS NOT LIKE YOU.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.834
WELL, I'M NOT LIKE ME.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE NEW ME.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.041
LOOK, VIOLET, I KNOW
THE TRIAL WAS ROUGH ON YOU.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.041
YOU FACED YOUR ATTACKER,
AND THAT WAS--

09:45.083 --> 09:47.166
FREEING.
I'M FREE. I'M GREAT.

09:47.208 --> 09:49.083
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

09:49.125 --> 09:52.125
THIS IS ABOUT BARBARA
AND WHAT SHE NEEDS.

09:52.166 --> 09:54.083
PETE,
WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING.

09:54.125 --> 09:56.959
WE'VE TRIED ANTIDEPRESSANTS,
ACUPRESSURE, BIOFEEDBACK,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.959
EXERCISE THERAPY, TALK THERAPY.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.041
NOTHING'S WORKING.
SLOW AND STEADY IS NOT WORKING.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.041
SLOW AND STEADY TAKES TIME.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.041
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S ALWAYS PREACHING THAT.
WELL, MAYBE I WAS WRONG.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.709
PEOPLE DESERVE MORE, FASTER.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.667
I ASKED YOU TO HELP,
AND YOU DID. AND THANK YOU.

10:11.709 --> 10:14.083
AND NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND,

10:14.125 --> 10:19.000
I AM TAKING MY NEW VIBRATOR
AND HEADING HOME.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.166
(car alarm chirps)

10:26.750 --> 10:28.709
I WANT YOU
TO PRESS THIS BUTTON

10:28.750 --> 10:31.041
WHENEVER YOU HAVE DISCOMFORT,
OKAY?
LILLIE.

10:31.083 --> 10:34.041
DR. MONTGOMERY,
THIS IS DR. REYNOLDS.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.041
I'M BRIAN,
HER NEW ONCOLOGIST.

10:36.083 --> 10:39.166
ADDISON. I DID
THE INITIAL RESECTION.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.458
MORPHINE, HUH?
THE PAIN'S WORSE?

10:41.500 --> 10:45.875
WELL, HOPEFULLY AFTER THE CHEMO,
IT SHOULD START TO SUBSIDE.

10:45.917 --> 10:48.750
I'M ACTUALLY
NOT RECOMMENDING THAT.

10:48.792 --> 10:51.583
BUT IF WE CAN GIVE HER
A FEW MORE MONTHS, THEN...

10:51.625 --> 10:55.166
I KNOW YOU'RE A SURGEON
AND YOU LIKE TO FIX THINGS,

10:55.208 --> 10:57.625
AND LILLIE TOLD ME
HOW GOOD YOU ARE,

10:57.667 --> 11:00.458
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO LET GO.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.041
I THINK THAT'S NOT
YOUR CALL.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.083
NO, IT'S MINE.

11:05.125 --> 11:08.083
I'M SORRY, ADDISON.
YOU DID YOUR BEST.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.625
I'M GRATEFUL.
BUT HE'S RIGHT. I'VE DECIDED.

11:10.667 --> 11:14.041
I THINK I WAS
HOLDING ON TO MY LIFE.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.542
BUT ONCE YOU AGREED
TO TAKE MILO,

11:16.583 --> 11:19.583
THERE'S NO REASON TO ANYMORE.

11:19.625 --> 11:23.333
IT'S TIME.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.792
(knock on doorjamb)

11:24.834 --> 11:26.792
BEFORE YOU YELL...

11:26.834 --> 11:28.834
I WANT TO START
WITH AN APOLOGY.

11:28.875 --> 11:32.041
I WANTED TO BE HERE YESTERDAY
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO DR. FIFE,

11:32.083 --> 11:34.125
BUT MY JET WAS DELAYED.
WE HAD A DEAL, WILLIAM.

11:34.166 --> 11:37.333
HIRING WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY,
AND YOU WENT AROUND ME.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.792
YOU KNEW THAT I WOULD OBJECT
TO HIS RESEARCH,

11:39.834 --> 11:41.959
HIS ATTITUDE
AND ULTIMATELY, HIS HIRING.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.834
I WAS AWARE
THAT YOU MIGHT OBJECT

11:43.875 --> 11:45.834
TO SOME OF HIS RESEARCH, YES.
OKAY, WOULD OBJECT.

11:45.875 --> 11:48.250
BUT HE BECAME AVAILABLE. THERE
WERE OTHER PEOPLE INTERESTED.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.250
I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION.
THINK OF THE POTENTIAL.

11:50.291 --> 11:52.417
SICKLE CELL, HEMOPHILIA,
CYSTIC FIBROSIS--

11:52.458 --> 11:54.041
HIS WORK HAS THE ABILITY

11:54.083 --> 11:56.583
TO CHANGE THE FACE OF MEDICINE
AS WE KNOW IT.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.667
THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I WANTED.
HE HAS NO MORAL CENTER.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.709
HE SUPPORTS EUGENICS.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.458
HE WANTS ME TO HELP HIM
DESIGN A BABY.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.458
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO, NAOMI,
WHEN YOU WEED OUT FOR DISEASE.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.583
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE SLIPPERY
SLOPE, BUT YOU'RE ALREADY ON IT.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.583
MAYBE, BUT I AM NOT
SKIING DOWN IT.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.500
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO ACCEPT HIM.

12:15.542 --> 12:19.625
I'M TELLING YOU...
FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK.

12:24.709 --> 12:28.166
SO THERE'LL BE A SEDATIVE
RUNNING IN THE I.V.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.917
AND ONCE I HIT THE SWITCH,
THE CURRENT WILL MOVE

12:30.959 --> 12:33.834
FROM THE LEFT CORTEX
TO THE RIGHT CORTEX,

12:33.875 --> 12:36.333
INDUCING A SEIZURE,

12:36.375 --> 12:38.417
WHICH WE WILL MONITOR
ON THE E.E.G.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.500
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?
IT'LL BE OVER
IN A FEW SECONDS.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.500
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA FEEL
A THING.

12:42.542 --> 12:45.333
A FEW DAYS OF OBSERVATION, I'LL
SEND YOU HOME A NEW WOMAN--

12:45.375 --> 12:47.458
A HAPPIER ONE ANYWAY.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.375
YOU READY?

12:55.083 --> 12:57.000
I LOVE YOU.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.667
OKAY.

13:06.709 --> 13:08.250
(clicks switch)

13:17.417 --> 13:19.375
(clicks switch)

13:22.333 --> 13:24.125
IS THAT IT?

13:24.166 --> 13:25.375
THAT'S IT.

13:25.417 --> 13:27.083
(exhales)

13:31.709 --> 13:36.041
WELL... IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M GONNA HAVE A CAT

13:36.083 --> 13:38.041
FOR LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

13:38.083 --> 13:41.291
YOUR PATIENT...
CHOSE HOSPICE.

13:41.333 --> 13:46.041
SHE'S REFUSING TREATMENT
AND SHE... IS GONNA DIE.

13:46.083 --> 13:48.542
I'M SORRY.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.500
SHE'S DYING ALONE.

13:50.542 --> 13:54.417
DO YOU HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE?
WE'RE ALL OUT DOWNSTAIRS. HEY.
HEY.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.667
YES, SAM. I ATE IT ALL. DO YOU
HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE, PLEASE?

14:01.166 --> 14:03.291
THAT'S FROM HALLOWEEN.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.250
DIDN'T GO WELL?
APPARENTLY I HAVE THE ABILITY
TO HIRE WHOEVER I WANT.

14:06.291 --> 14:09.333
SO DOES HE.
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO DO
WHAT FIFE'S ASKING YOU TO DO.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.041
IT'S STILL YOUR PRACTICE.
YEAH, IF HE'S BEING
SUCH A JERK,

14:12.083 --> 14:15.333
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL HIM OFF?
I CAN'T. HE'S IN THAT CHAIR.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.625
WHAT? I-I KNOW
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT,

14:17.667 --> 14:21.166
BUT TELLING OFF A MAN WHO'S...
(mutters) IT FEELS WRONG. CAN'T.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.458
THEN I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
TO THE LITTLE PEOPLE.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.417
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
THEY'RE YOUR PATIENTS NOW.

14:26.458 --> 14:30.041
TALK THEM OUT OF IT.
IF YOU THINK IT'S WRONG,
THEN CONVINCE THEM.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.667
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:31.709 --> 14:34.000
I'LL CONVINCE 'EM.

14:38.458 --> 14:42.041
GO AHEAD. TAKE 'EM.
(chuckles)
(mouth full) THANK YOU.

14:42.083 --> 14:45.000
(elevator bell dings)

14:48.208 --> 14:50.417
CHARLOTTE.

14:55.417 --> 14:58.583
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE JOINED
OCEANSIDE WELLNESS.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.583
GOOD FOR YOU.
IT IS... GOOD FOR ME.

15:01.625 --> 15:04.250
IT'S ALLOWED ME TO REFOCUS
MY PRIORITIES

15:04.291 --> 15:06.000
ON TO PATIENT CARE--

15:06.041 --> 15:08.083
SOMETHING MY PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES

15:08.125 --> 15:10.041
PREVENTED ME FROM DOING.

15:10.083 --> 15:14.500
WELL, IT APPEARS IT ALL
WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.041
(ding)

15:16.083 --> 15:19.375
YES, I'VE GOT PATIENTS
LINING UP OUT THE DOOR.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.458
CONGRATULATIONS
ON ALL YOUR SUCCESS.

15:25.583 --> 15:28.959
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:29.000 --> 15:31.875
HI. I WAS JUST
KEEPING JIMMY COMPANY

15:31.917 --> 15:33.875
WHILE HE WAITS FOR HER
TO WAKE UP.

15:33.917 --> 15:36.083
HE'S GETTING COFFEE.
SHE'S FINE.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.500
IT WENT OFF WITHOUT A HITCH.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.250
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.250
MM.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.625
HEY. HEY, BARBARA.
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.875
EVERYTHING WENT WELL.

15:47.917 --> 15:51.291
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
OH, I HAVE A HEADACHE.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.125
BUT THERE'S NOTHING PRESSING
DOWN ON MY SHOULDERS ANYMORE.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.041
I F--

15:58.083 --> 16:00.208
I FEEL...

16:00.250 --> 16:02.500
LIGHTER.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.583
(laughs)

16:04.625 --> 16:06.667
HI.

16:06.709 --> 16:10.583
WOW. LOOK AT YOU.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.500
LOOK AT THAT SMILE.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.500
I MISSED THAT SMILE.

16:16.291 --> 16:17.667
BARB?

16:17.709 --> 16:21.583
I'M SORRY.
UH, DO I KNOW YOU?

16:27.625 --> 16:30.542
MILD, TEMPORARY MEMORY LOSS IS
A COMMON SIDE EFFECT OF E.C.T.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.750
MILD? SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER ME.
SHE LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH ME.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.625
THE MEMORY LOSS
SHOULD RESOLVE IN TIME.
AND UNTIL THEN, WHAT DO I DO?

16:36.667 --> 16:38.750
DO I REMIND HER OF THINGS

16:38.792 --> 16:42.625
OR DO I HAVE TO KEEP
MY DISTANCE?
LOOK, I-I KNOW
THIS IS SCARY, JIMMY.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.625
BUT DON'T EXPECT HER
TO REACT TO YOU

16:44.667 --> 16:46.542
THE WAY SHE HAS IN THE PAST.

16:46.583 --> 16:49.041
BUT YOU CAN TALK TO HER,
JOG HER MEMORY.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.000
THAT MAY HELP.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.583
OKAY, VIOLET.

16:56.625 --> 16:59.125
CARDS ON THE TABLE--
HOW BAD IS THIS?

16:59.166 --> 17:02.542
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW, PETE.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.959
I MEAN, IT'S RARE, BUT SOMETIMES
THE MEMORY LOSS IS PERMANENT.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.041
BUT SHE SEEMED GOOD--
HER ATTITUDE.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.208
I MEAN, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN,
ISN'T IT?

17:10.250 --> 17:12.834
IT IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.
THAT'S HIS FIANCéE,

17:12.875 --> 17:14.834
AND YOU'RE SAYING
SHE MIGHT NEVER REMEMBER HIM?

17:14.875 --> 17:17.834
SHE'S HAPPY. THAT'S GOOD
FOR HER. BUT WHAT ABOUT HIM?

17:17.875 --> 17:21.250
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO RUSH INTO THIS.
I WILL FIX THIS, OKAY?

17:23.917 --> 17:26.583
I WILL.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.375
ONCE WE START DOWN THE ROAD
OF CHOOSING CHARACTERISTICS

17:29.417 --> 17:31.041
FOR OUR CHILDREN,

17:31.083 --> 17:33.959
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT ENDS.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.041
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT OUR PRACTICE DOES.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.208
I DO WANT TO WORK WITH YOU.
I DO.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.667
BUT, UM...

17:40.709 --> 17:43.041
YOUR DAUGHTER?

17:43.083 --> 17:44.667
UH, YEAH.

17:44.709 --> 17:46.417
SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.417
SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE YOU.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.875
(chuckles) THANK YOU.

17:49.917 --> 17:53.041
YOU KNOW, I-I-I NEVER REALLY
SEE THE RESEMBLANCE, BUT, UH--

17:53.083 --> 17:55.041
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

17:55.083 --> 17:58.083
YOU TAKE IT FOR GRANTED--HAVING
A CHILD THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU.

17:58.125 --> 18:01.041
BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD YOU
YOU COULDN'T HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER,

18:01.083 --> 18:03.917
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER,
WHO'S LIKE YOU IN SO MANY WAYS?

18:03.959 --> 18:06.500
EVEN IF YOU DON'T SELECT
FOR DWARFISM,

18:06.542 --> 18:09.333
YOUR CHILD WILL BE
A PART OF YOU.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.333
WHAT DO YOU SEE
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME?

18:11.375 --> 18:12.834
I...

18:12.875 --> 18:15.333
IT'S A HARD QUESTION FOR
A TALL PERSON TO ANSWER...

18:15.375 --> 18:17.709
(chuckles) BECAUSE ALL YOU SEE
IS THE DWARF.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.041
NO. NO, I DON'T.

18:20.083 --> 18:23.041
WHEN I LOOK AT CURTIS, I SEE
AN ACCOUNTANT, A HUSBAND,

18:23.083 --> 18:25.667
AND THOSE THINGS
ARE WHAT OUR FRIENDS SEE.

18:25.709 --> 18:27.834
IF WE HAVE A CHILD
WHO'S 5'10",

18:27.875 --> 18:31.041
THEY'LL LOOK AT HIM THE WAY
OTHER PEOPLE LOOK AT US.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.875
WHAT IF YOU HAD A 50/50 CHANCE
OF HAVING A WHITE BABY?

18:33.917 --> 18:36.750
WOULD YOU WANT A WHITE BABY?
N--IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

18:36.792 --> 18:39.834
IT IS. YOU'D LOVE
THAT WHITE BABY,

18:39.875 --> 18:42.542
BUT EVERY DAY, PEOPLE WOULD
QUESTION WHETHER SHE WAS YOURS.

18:42.583 --> 18:45.875
THEY'D WHISPER LIKE THEY'LL
WHISPER ABOUT OUR TALL CHILD.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.875
WOULD YOU WANT THAT
FOR YOUR CHILD?
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO CLONE US.

18:48.917 --> 18:51.000
WE'RE JUST ASKING
FOR WHAT ANY OTHER PARENT

18:51.041 --> 18:53.000
WOULD COME IN AND ASK FOR.

18:53.041 --> 18:56.625
WE WANT WHAT YOU HAVE.
HOW IS THAT CROSSING A LINE?

19:03.959 --> 19:05.917
YOU GOING TO STAND THERE
ALL DAY

19:05.959 --> 19:09.250
OR DO YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY?

19:09.291 --> 19:11.000
IN THE WRONG HANDS,

19:11.041 --> 19:14.000
GENETIC ENGINEERING CAN HAVE
TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES.

19:14.041 --> 19:17.792
SO WHILE YOU ARE HERE,
I'M GONNA BE THE GATEKEEPER.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.417
THAT MEANS I SET THE LIMITS.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.500
IF THERE'S GONNA BE
ANY SLIPPERY SLOPE,

19:22.542 --> 19:26.542
I'M GONNA BE THE ONE TO DECIDE
JUST HOW FAR WE SLIDE.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.208
SO YOU'RE IN
WITH THE DONOVANS?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.959
YES.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.041
WELL... DON'T EXPECT ME
TO THANK YOU

19:34.083 --> 19:35.750
FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT.

19:35.792 --> 19:38.041
(Pixie Lott's
"Way the World Works" playing)

19:38.083 --> 19:40.917
HE IS JUST...
HE'S A LITTLE MAN.

19:40.959 --> 19:43.917
(laughs)
I'M SORRY. WHEELCHAIR OR NO,
HE IS A LITTLE MAN.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.709
OH. WHAT...

19:45.750 --> 19:47.333
WHAT IS THIS?

19:47.375 --> 19:48.792
(laughs)

19:48.834 --> 19:51.333
IT'S A CHRISTMAS ANGEL.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.792
YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR KITTY CAROLING.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.041
WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.208
UM, TH-- (laughs)
THIS ISN'T HER CAT.

19:57.250 --> 20:00.041
THIS IS, UH, FOR A TEMPORARY CAT
SHE'S TAKING CARE OF.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.625
SO NO CAROLING.
OKAY.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.041
BUT THANK YOU.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.041
OKAY, THIS PLACE IS INSANE,
ALL RIGHT?

20:06.083 --> 20:08.041
WE ARE IN RETAIL PURGATORY.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.208
ALL BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO DO

SOME OTHER QUESTIONS, OKAY?

21:57.375 --> 21:59.333

MONKLANDS HIGH.
PROM DATE?

22:01.500 --> 22:04.041
EDDIE PARKER. GREAT PROM.
ROMANCE IN VENICE.

22:04.083 --> 22:06.000
WOW.
THAT--THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.000
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE
REMEMBERED THEIR PROM THEME.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.083
IT WAS GREAT.
WE DID IT BY THIS POOL

22:10.125 --> 22:12.083
WITH THESE GIANT
PAPIER-MâCHé GONDOLAS.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.375
(chuckles)

22:13.417 --> 22:15.375
I THINK I REMEMBER BECAUSE...

22:15.417 --> 22:18.917
MY DAD TOLD ME
SO MANY STORIES ABOUT VENICE.

22:18.959 --> 22:21.959
HE WENT THERE WITH MY MOM
ON THEIR HONEYMOON.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.375
CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HIS ILLNESS?

22:24.417 --> 22:27.375
HE--HE WAS JUST SICK
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

22:27.417 --> 22:31.083
AND HE TRIED TO HANG ON
UNTIL...
UNTIL THE WEDDING?

22:31.125 --> 22:34.041
WHAT?

22:34.083 --> 22:36.083
WHAT WEDDING?

22:36.125 --> 22:38.041
TO JIMMY.

22:38.083 --> 22:41.166
YOU AND JIMMY
WERE GOING TO GET MARRIED.

22:41.208 --> 22:43.041
I DON'T KNOW.

22:43.083 --> 22:47.000
I'M SORRY. HE--HE SEEMS LIKE
A REALLY NICE GUY.

22:47.041 --> 22:50.000
I-I REALLY WISH
I COULD REMEMBER.

22:50.041 --> 22:52.000
SHE REMEMBERS
NOTHING ABOUT JIMMY.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.000
SHE REMEMBERS
EVERYTHING ELSE--EVERYTHING.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.834
MEMORY LOSS FROM E.C.T.
IS NOT THAT SPECIFIC.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.041
THEN WHAT IS IT?
I THINK THE E.C.T. WORKED.
I THINK IT UNBLOCKED HER.

23:00.083 --> 23:03.041
I THINK WE GOT TO THE ROOT
OF HER DEPRESSION.

23:03.083 --> 23:06.750
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS JIMMY.
SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH JIMMY,

23:06.792 --> 23:09.375
SOMETHING SO BAD
THAT SHE BLOCKED IT OUT.

23:14.417 --> 23:16.041
GOOD MORNING, NAI.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.166
HEY.

23:17.208 --> 23:18.792
OH, I HEAR YOU HIRED
A NEW DOCTOR.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.458
WHATEVER.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.625
I'M SORRY. NO, YES.
A-A DOCTOR HAS BEEN HIRED.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.166
AND HE'S GREAT,

23:25.208 --> 23:28.041
AND EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE GREAT.

23:28.083 --> 23:31.041
IF YOU COULD ERASE
BAD MEMORIES,

23:31.083 --> 23:33.250
DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING
IN YOUR LIFE WOULD BETTER?

23:33.291 --> 23:37.041
YEAH. THERE'S SOME THINGS
IN MY LIFE I'D LIKE TO ERASE.
YEAH, WOULDN'T WE ALL?

23:37.083 --> 23:40.041
OH, UM... SAY THE THING.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.875
OH. OKAY.

23:41.917 --> 23:44.041
VIOLET IS NOT READY
TO COME BACK.

23:44.083 --> 23:47.625
DO NOT GET YOUR HOPES UP.
DO NOT PUSH. WAIT.

23:47.667 --> 23:50.542
BUT SHE'S BETTER.
SHE'S FREED OR SOMETHING.
DO--DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY THE THING AGAIN?

23:50.583 --> 23:52.125
YEAH.
OKAY.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.417
VIOLET IS NOT READY
TO COME BACK.

23:54.458 --> 23:58.041
DO NOT GET YOUR HOPES UP.
DO NOT PUSH. WAIT.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.500
OKAY. THANKS.

23:59.542 --> 24:01.625
OKAY. ANYTIME.

24:08.291 --> 24:10.250
WHITE MAY HAVE HIRED YOU,

24:10.291 --> 24:13.291
BUT YOU WORK FOR ME,
AND AS LONG AS YOU DO,

24:13.333 --> 24:16.208
YOU WILL NOT WITHHOLD
INFORMATION FROM ME.
EXACTLY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

24:16.250 --> 24:18.583
THE EMBRYOS THAT HAVE
THE MARKER FOR DWARFISM--

24:18.625 --> 24:21.125
THEY HAVE A MUTATION THAT
THE OTHER EMBRYOS DON'T HAVE.

24:21.166 --> 24:24.000
IT'S CALLED V.H.L.
I KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED,
AND CHILDREN BORN WITH IT

24:24.041 --> 24:26.000
HAVE A 40% CHANCE
OF DEVELOPING CANCER

24:26.041 --> 24:28.709
BY THE TIME
THAT THEY'RE IN THEIR 20s.
IT'S A NONISSUE.

24:28.750 --> 24:32.041
IT'S CANCER.
AND IN 20 YEARS,
IF THESE CHILDREN DEVELOP IT,

24:32.083 --> 24:35.041
MY GENE THERAPY TREATMENTS
WILL ALLOW ME TO CURE IT.

24:35.083 --> 24:38.500
NO ONE CAN GUARANTEE THAT.
I CAN. I DID.

24:38.542 --> 24:40.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU DID?
I TOLD THE DONOVANS.

24:40.542 --> 24:44.333
THEY WANT TO GO AHEAD
WITH THE IMPLANTATION.
THEY'D RATHER HAVE A SICK,
DWARF CHILD

24:44.375 --> 24:46.542
THAN A TALL, HEALTHY ONE?
MM-HMM.

24:46.583 --> 24:50.333
THE NON-DWARF EMBRYOS
DON'T HAVE THE MUTATION.
I TOLD YOU, IT'S A NONISSUE.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.333
OH, YOU--I HAVE BEEN
WALKING AROUND HERE

24:52.375 --> 24:55.208
TRYING TO BE POLITE TO YOU,
BUT THAT IS IT. I AM DONE.

24:55.250 --> 24:59.125
YOU ARE THE MOST EGOTISTICAL,
PUSHY, BOORISH LITTLE MAN

24:59.166 --> 25:02.333
THAT I HAVE EVER MET.
GOOD FOR YOU.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.208
EXCUSE ME?
YOU GOT OVER YOUR FEAR
OF THE WHEELCHAIR.

25:05.250 --> 25:08.125
THAT USUALLY TAKES PEOPLE
A FEW MONTHS,

25:08.166 --> 25:11.125
BUT YOU? LESS THAN A WEEK.
I'M IMPRESSED.

25:11.166 --> 25:14.041
NOW IF YOU CAN JUST GET OVER
YOUR FEAR OF LITTLE PEOPLE--
SHUT UP!

25:14.083 --> 25:17.917
SHUT UP, YOU STUPID,
HORRIBLE, STUPID... JERK!

25:17.959 --> 25:19.959
OH! OKAY,
THAT WAS KINDA LAME.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.083
(mutters)
WE'RE STILL DOING
THE IMPLANTATION.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.333
NO! NO, WE ARE NOT.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.333
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

25:27.375 --> 25:29.166
UM, HEY, JIMMY,

25:29.208 --> 25:32.959
DESCRIBE THE LAST FIGHT
YOU HAD WITH BARBARA.
OUR LAST FIGHT?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.458
WE DON'T FIGHT.
WELL, COME ON.
ALL COUPLES FIGHT.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.458
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A BIG THING.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.166
IT CAN BE SMALL EVEN.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.041
YOU WERE ALWAYS SO SAD.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.166
I-I DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU ANYMORE.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.875
WELL, HOW--HOW ABOUT YOU,
BARBARA?

25:46.917 --> 25:49.250
I-I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK ABOUT JIMMY,

25:49.291 --> 25:53.125
BUT JUST DESCRIBE THE LAST FIGHT
YOU HAD WITH ANYONE.
UM...

25:53.166 --> 25:55.583
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

25:55.625 --> 25:58.041
WELL, LIKE VIOLET SAID,
EVERYONE FIGHTS.

25:58.083 --> 26:00.458
IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S JUST...

26:00.500 --> 26:04.083
I'M SORRY.
I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO REMEMBER,

26:04.125 --> 26:07.458
AND I WANT TO REMEMBER...
GOOD THINGS.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.166
BUT TO START TALKING
ABOUT FIGHTS?

26:10.208 --> 26:14.458
I... I'VE DISCOVERED PEACHES
AND THE SMELL OF LAVENDER.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.458
AND I'M JUST...

26:16.500 --> 26:20.041
I'M SO HAPPY.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.917
I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK.

26:21.959 --> 26:24.458
BARBARA... PLEASE.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.041
YOU HAVE TO TRY.

26:26.083 --> 26:29.041
WE WERE IN LOVE.
YOU LOVED ME.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.834
I'M SORRY.

26:30.875 --> 26:33.917
YOU SEEM SO NICE.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.792
BUT...

26:40.250 --> 26:42.625
(inhales deeply)

26:42.667 --> 26:44.792
CAN I HAVE SOME MORE JELL-O?

26:47.083 --> 26:49.041
SO HOW DID YOU
HEAR ABOUT ME?

26:49.083 --> 26:51.041
UH, WELL, I-I SAW YOU
AT A SEMINAR.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.417
GREAT.

26:52.458 --> 26:55.250
THERE'S REALLY NO NEED TO BE
NERVOUS, MR. PARKER.

26:55.291 --> 26:57.250
WHATEVER ISSUE YOU HAVE,
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT OPENLY.

26:57.291 --> 27:00.333
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO HELP.

27:00.375 --> 27:03.417
SO... HOW CAN I HELP?

27:03.458 --> 27:05.542
(exhales)

27:05.583 --> 27:07.333
I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND.

27:07.375 --> 27:10.959
AND I WANT HER
TO BE HAPPY...

27:11.000 --> 27:12.500
SATISFIED.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.000
I UNDERSTAND.

27:14.041 --> 27:18.125
BUT I'M JUST
A LITTLE TOO QUICK ON, UM...

27:18.166 --> 27:20.792
PULLING THE TRIGGER?
WELL, THAT'S A COMMON PROBLEM.

27:20.834 --> 27:24.291
THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE
EXPLANATIONS AND TREATMENTS.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.291
WE WILL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.041
AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU,

27:28.083 --> 27:31.000
YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND
WILL BE SATISFIED.
GREAT. THAT--THAT'S GREAT.

27:31.041 --> 27:34.000
THAT--THAT'S WHY I WENT
ONLINE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

27:34.041 --> 27:37.166
BUT THE MORE I READ,
THE MORE FREAKED OUT I GOT,

27:37.208 --> 27:40.375
THEN SOMEONE IN THE CHAT ROOM
SUGGESTED YOU, AND, UM--
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU SAW ME AT A SEMINAR.

27:40.417 --> 27:43.166
RIGHT. AFTER THE SEMINAR,
I WENT TO A CHAT ROOM.

27:43.208 --> 27:45.917
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO MENTION
THE CHAT ROOM.

27:45.959 --> 27:49.041
EXACTLY WHAT CHAT ROOM
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

27:51.417 --> 27:53.792
UH, WE DON'T ALLOW ANIMALS
IN HERE.

27:53.834 --> 27:55.333
I'M KIDDING.

27:55.375 --> 27:56.792
OH.
I'M IMPRESSED.

27:56.834 --> 27:59.333
WITH THIS? IT IS
PRETTY FABULOUS, ISN'T IT?

27:59.375 --> 28:01.875
NO, THAT YOU'D BRING A CAT
FOR A VISIT.

28:01.917 --> 28:03.792
IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU.
OH.

28:03.834 --> 28:05.792
MAYBE YOU'RE A CAT PERSON
AFTER ALL.

28:05.834 --> 28:08.041
I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE PAYING ME A COMPLIMENT,

28:08.083 --> 28:10.083
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.
(clears throat)
NO?

28:10.125 --> 28:12.417
OH, ACTUALLY I WAS HOPING
IT WOULD FLATTER YOU ENOUGH

28:12.458 --> 28:14.417
THAT YOU'D HAVE COFFEE
WITH ME.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.417
YOU'RE ASKING ME OUT
ON A DATE

28:16.458 --> 28:20.041
AS WE WALK TO OUR
TERMINALLY ILL PATIENT'S ROOM?
I'M AN ONCOLOGIST.

28:20.083 --> 28:22.417
I'M ALWAYS WALKING TO
A TERMINALLY ILL PATIENT'S ROOM.

28:22.458 --> 28:25.166
I ASK WHERE I CAN, WHEN I CAN
OR I'D NEVER GET TO ASK.

28:25.208 --> 28:27.542
YES, TO COFFEE.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.041
OKAY.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.667
AH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:30.709 --> 28:33.750
CAN YOU JUST HOLD THIS
FOR A MINUTE?
SURE.

28:33.792 --> 28:36.250
HEY, MILO.

28:36.291 --> 28:39.041
HELLO, MILO.

28:39.083 --> 28:42.333
THERE WE GO.
HOW'S HIS HAIR?

28:42.375 --> 28:44.041
PERFECT.
OKAY.

28:44.083 --> 28:45.583
(meows)

28:45.625 --> 28:47.709
OKAY, BUD.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.500
I'M SORRY.

29:03.458 --> 29:05.417
SHE'S AFRAID.
OF COURSE SHE'S AFRAID.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.417
SHE'S FEELING GOOD.
SHE'S FEELING BETTER.

29:07.458 --> 29:10.041
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THAT.
SO HOW DO WE BREAK THROUGH?

29:10.083 --> 29:12.250
WE DON'T.
THAT'S IT?
SHE'S BLOCKED OUT JIMMY,

29:12.291 --> 29:14.250
YOU THINK THERE'S
A BIG MYSTERY ABOUT HIM,

29:14.291 --> 29:16.709
AND WE JUST GIVE HER JELL-O?
SHE FOUND
A MAGIC BULLET, PETE.

29:16.750 --> 29:18.291
AND WHAT ABOUT JIMMY?

29:18.333 --> 29:20.291
IF YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HIM,
HE COULD BE DANGEROUS.

29:20.333 --> 29:23.291
IF NOT, THEN IS IT FAIR THAT HE
SUDDENLY BECOMES NOBODY TO HER?

29:23.333 --> 29:25.291
I WISH I COULD FORGET.
I WISH I COULD...

29:25.333 --> 29:28.083
FIND EVERYTHING BAD THAT
HAPPENED TO ME AND YANK IT OUT.

29:28.125 --> 29:32.041
I CAN'T. SHE CAN. I'M NOT
GONNA TAKE THAT AWAY FROM HER.
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT PUSHED HER

29:32.083 --> 29:34.333
TO GET THE E.C.T., VIOLET,
AND NOW SHE'S DAMAGED.
SHE'S BETTER.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.041
I DON'T BUY THAT.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.041
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
TO THE TRUTH, I WILL.
PETE, D--

29:39.083 --> 29:43.041
BARBARA... WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT JIMMY.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

29:43.083 --> 29:45.125
PETE, LET HER REST.
WHAT'S WRONG IS YOUR MEMORY.

29:45.166 --> 29:47.125
NOW I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT AND YOU'RE FEELING BETTER,

29:47.166 --> 29:49.125
BUT E.C.T. DOES NOT--
PETE--

29:49.166 --> 29:52.583
E.C.T. DOES NOT COMPLETELY ERASE
ONE PERSON FROM YOUR MEMORY

29:52.625 --> 29:54.333
AND LEAVE
EVERYTHING ELSE INTACT.

29:54.375 --> 29:57.041
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS.
TH-THEN...
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:57.083 --> 29:59.375
IF YOU'RE BLOCKING JIMMY OUT,
THERE MIGHT BE A REASON--

29:59.417 --> 30:01.375
A REAL REASON,
NOT AN E.C.T. REASON--

30:01.417 --> 30:03.458
SOMETHING HE DID.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.250
SOMETHING THAT--THAT--
THAT YOU'RE BURYING.

30:06.291 --> 30:09.583
SOMETHING THAT--THAT YOU'VE
BURIED SO DEEPLY

30:09.625 --> 30:11.125
DURING THE PAST YEAR

30:11.166 --> 30:14.041
THAT IT MIGHT BE HARD
TO TALK ABOUT.

30:14.083 --> 30:16.333
IF JIMMY DID SOMETHING
TO YOU, IF YOU'RE SCARED,

30:16.375 --> 30:18.333
WE CAN HELP PROTECT YOU.
YOU CAN TELL US,

30:18.375 --> 30:20.458
AND NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS,
NO MATTER HOW AWFUL,

30:20.500 --> 30:22.458
WE'LL MAKE SURE
HE NEVER HURTS YOU AGAIN.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.041
(laughing)

30:25.083 --> 30:27.125
I'M SORRY.

30:27.166 --> 30:29.417
WAS THERE SOMETHING FUNNY
ABOUT THAT?

30:29.458 --> 30:32.125
(laughing) NO, THE IDEA
THAT JIMMY IS DANGEROUS.

30:32.166 --> 30:34.208
(continues laughing)

30:34.250 --> 30:36.834
YOU KNOW HIM. HE'S...
(continues laughing)

30:36.875 --> 30:38.500
WHAT?

30:38.542 --> 30:40.625
(inhales deeply)

30:40.667 --> 30:41.834
NICE.

30:41.875 --> 30:44.041
YOU REMEMBER JIMMY.

30:44.083 --> 30:45.959
I-I WOKE UP FEELING BETTER.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.041
I SMILED, AND THEN I SAW
JIMMY WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR,

30:49.083 --> 30:51.041
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO SMILE ANYMORE.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.041
I COULDN'T JUST TELL HIM
TO GO AWAY

30:53.083 --> 30:54.291
AFTER EVERYTHING HE'S DONE.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.291
BUT I REMEMBER
YOU TELLING ME

30:56.333 --> 30:59.375
THAT E.C.T.
CAN CAUSE MEMORY LOSS,

30:59.417 --> 31:01.500
SO I SUDDENLY REALIZED,
I COULD FORGET HIM.

31:01.542 --> 31:04.792
AND THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO HURT HIS FEELINGS.

31:04.834 --> 31:07.583
WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN EASIER
TO JUST TELL HIM?

31:07.625 --> 31:09.166
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ENGAGED TO HIM.

31:09.208 --> 31:12.166
AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I-I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.

31:12.208 --> 31:14.166
WHEN I WAS DEPRESSED,
HE--HE SEEMED FINE.

31:14.208 --> 31:17.166
AND HE TOOK CARE OF ME,
AND I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.875
BUT AFTER THE E.C.T.,

31:18.917 --> 31:20.875
IT'S LIKE THE LIGHTS
IN MY HEAD WENT ON,

31:20.917 --> 31:23.000
AND... WHAT WAS I THINKING?

31:23.041 --> 31:25.375
NO WONDER I WAS DEPRESSED
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.375
DON'T YOU THINK
YOUR FATHER'S DEATH

31:27.417 --> 31:29.375
MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT?

31:29.417 --> 31:31.417
YES, OF COURSE.
HE LIKED JIMMY SO MUCH.

31:31.458 --> 31:34.166
HE USED TO TELL ME
ALL THE TIME,

31:34.208 --> 31:36.875
"BARBARA, JIMMY--
HE'S SUCH A NICE BOY.

31:36.917 --> 31:39.083
HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY."

31:39.125 --> 31:42.583
SOMETIMES, I--UGH!
I WANT HIM TO HURT A FLY.

31:42.625 --> 31:45.583
YOU GET IT. JIMMY'S THAT GUY--
THAT GUY AT THE BAR

31:45.625 --> 31:47.375
THAT YOU GO HOME WITH
AT 3:00 A.M.

31:47.417 --> 31:50.500
BECAUSE THE GUY YOU REALLY
WANT TO GO HOME WITH

31:50.542 --> 31:53.709
WENT HOME WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

31:53.750 --> 31:57.166
TELLING HIM--
IT JUST SEEMS CRUEL.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.208
I WANT TO SPARE HIM.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.625
ISN'T THIS BETTER?

32:07.250 --> 32:10.041
(footsteps approach)

32:10.083 --> 32:12.458
I JUST TOLD OFF A MAN
IN A WHEELCHAIR,

32:12.500 --> 32:15.083
AND IT FELT SO GOOD.

32:15.125 --> 32:19.041
I MAY BE GOING TO HELL,
BUT I AM TAKING HIM WITH ME.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.291
WHAT'S WRONG?

32:20.333 --> 32:22.041
LILLIE DIED.

32:22.083 --> 32:23.959
I'M SORRY.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.959
(voice breaking) ALONE,
IN A TINY ROOM BY HERSELF

32:27.000 --> 32:29.542
WITHOUT FAMILY,
WITHOUT FRIENDS...

32:29.583 --> 32:32.834
ADDISON,
YOU'RE NOT DYING...

32:32.875 --> 32:35.083
AND YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.083
I KNOW. I HAVE YOU...

32:37.125 --> 32:38.583
AND SAM...

32:38.625 --> 32:39.875
YEAH.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.750
AND THIS PRACTICE.

32:41.792 --> 32:46.041
BUT... GOD, I AM ALONE.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.458
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ME

32:48.500 --> 32:51.458
OR IF I HAVE SOME BAD KARMA
BECAUSE I'M A CHEATER,

32:51.500 --> 32:54.458
BUT EVERY MAN I MEET,
IT'S EITHER THE WRONG PERSON

32:54.500 --> 32:57.125
OR THE WRONG TIME.

32:57.166 --> 32:59.125
EVEN THE ONCOLOGIST--
LILLIE'S ONCOLOGIST.

32:59.166 --> 33:00.667
HE ASKED ME OUT.

33:00.709 --> 33:02.583
BRIAN REYNOLDS?
HE'S CUTE.

33:02.625 --> 33:05.250
YES. I SAID YES.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.959
BUT I CAN'T, NAI.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.375
I'M A MESS.

33:08.417 --> 33:10.750
I'M TOO SCREWED UP TO DATE.

33:13.458 --> 33:17.000
UGH. AND THIS DAMN CAT
KEEPS STARING AT ME.

33:19.959 --> 33:22.709
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

33:22.750 --> 33:24.709
HEY, DR. KING.
I'M WITH A PATIENT.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.041
A REAL PATIENT.

33:26.083 --> 33:28.375
NOT LIKE THAT GUY YOU SENT ME,
THE ONE WITH THE...

33:28.417 --> 33:31.041
YOU MET HIM IN A CHAT ROOM.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.375
MY MOM DOESN'T LET ME
GO INTO CHAT ROOMS.

33:33.417 --> 33:35.750
YOUR MOM'S RIGHT, UNLESS YOU'RE
SUPERVISED BY A GROWN-UP.

33:35.792 --> 33:38.834
I'M A GROWN-UP--
NO, HE ISN'T.

33:38.875 --> 33:42.625
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.
DON'T. I DON'T NEED
YOUR PITY PATIENTS.

33:42.667 --> 33:45.041
(Curtis) YOUR HESITATION

33:45.083 --> 33:48.583
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE SECOND GENETIC LESION.

33:48.625 --> 33:51.041
LET'S CALL THIS
WHAT IT IS.
YES, LET'S.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.625
UH, WHICH IS WHAT?

33:52.667 --> 33:55.041
YOU WON'T DO THE IMPLANTATION
BECAUSE YOU THINK WE'RE FREAKS.

33:55.083 --> 33:57.625
YOU'RE PREJUDICED
AGAINST LITTLE PEOPLE.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.709
THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD RATHER
DO THAN GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT,

34:00.750 --> 34:04.000
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
FOR US.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.041
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU WANT--
LOOK AT YOU.

34:06.083 --> 34:07.458
HOW CAN YOU
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND

34:07.500 --> 34:10.250
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE LAUGHED AT,
TO NEVER FIT IN?

34:10.291 --> 34:12.875
YOU'RE TALL AND BEAUTIFUL
AND SUCCESSFUL.

34:12.917 --> 34:15.750
I WAS FAT.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.166
AS A KID, I... I WAS FAT.

34:18.208 --> 34:20.500
I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST
THAT IT'S COMPARABLE,

34:20.542 --> 34:23.166
BUT EVERYONE HAS
THEIR OWN SCARS TO BEAR.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.166
WE ALL HAVE
OUR INSECURITIES,

34:25.208 --> 34:27.166
AND--AND THEY'RE PAINFUL
AND--AND PERSISTENT,

34:27.208 --> 34:29.041
AND THEY'RE OURS.

34:29.083 --> 34:32.792
I DON'T WANT TO COMPARE
PAINFUL ANECDOTES WITH YOU,

34:32.834 --> 34:35.792
I'M JUST SAYING, IS IN SOME
SMALL WAY, I DO UNDERSTAND.
A SMALL WAY?

34:35.834 --> 34:38.583
OH, YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY HARD
TO AVOID USING WORDS

34:38.625 --> 34:41.458
LIKE "BIG" AND "SMALL"
AND "SHORT" AND "TALL."

34:41.500 --> 34:43.458
WE TRY TO SAY THINGS NICELY,

34:43.500 --> 34:45.458
BUT YOU--YOU KNOW,
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

34:45.500 --> 34:47.041
I WASN'T JUST FAT.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.583
"FAT" IS THE NICE WORD
FOR WHAT I WAS.

34:49.625 --> 34:52.083
I WAS HUGE.
I WAS MASSIVE.

34:52.125 --> 34:54.542
SIX SUMMERS OF FAT CAMP.

34:54.583 --> 34:58.250
MY WHOLE ADOLESCENCE
BEING MADE FUN OF.

34:58.291 --> 35:01.709
I HAVE HEARD EVERY SINGLE JOKE--
"LARD-O," AND "FAT ASS"

35:01.750 --> 35:03.959
AND, UH, "DUMBO"
AND "ELEPHANT" AND--

35:04.000 --> 35:05.959
IN OUR GROUP OF FRIENDS,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.667
A TALL CHILD WILL BE "LURCH"
OR "GIANT" OR "GODZILLA."

35:08.709 --> 35:12.250
BUT IF HE'S HEALTHY,
HE'LL SURVIVE IT.

35:12.291 --> 35:15.041
I DID. YOU DID.

35:15.083 --> 35:18.834
BUT I CANNOT IMPLANT
A SICK EMBRYO.

35:18.875 --> 35:20.834
NO MATTER
WHAT DR. FIFE PROMISES YOU

35:20.875 --> 35:24.333
ABOUT FUTURE BREAKTHROUGHS,
I CANNOT DO IT.

35:24.375 --> 35:28.875
BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS HELP YOU
TO HAVE A HEALTHY BABY.

35:28.917 --> 35:31.375
AND WHETHER HE IS TALL
OR--OR MEDIUM OR SMALL,

35:31.417 --> 35:34.542
WHEN YOU HOLD HIM IN YOUR ARMS,
HE WILL BE YOURS.

35:34.583 --> 35:36.750
AND YOU'LL LOVE HIM.

35:36.792 --> 35:39.792
ISN'T THAT
ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS?

35:39.834 --> 35:42.500
THAT'S WHAT I CAN GIVE YOU.

35:48.917 --> 35:50.750
ARE YOU DR. MONTGOMERY?

35:50.792 --> 35:52.667
THE HOSPITAL TOLD ME
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

35:52.709 --> 35:55.583
I'M IRIS.
LILLIE'S SECOND COUSIN IRIS.

35:55.625 --> 35:58.375
OH, UH, YEAH.
PLEASE... COME IN.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.834
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

36:02.875 --> 36:06.083
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT LILLIE HAD ANY FAMILY.

36:06.125 --> 36:08.041
WE WEREN'T CLOSE.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.166
BUT LILLIE CALLED ME, ASKED ME
TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS,

36:11.208 --> 36:13.000
WRAP UP THE LOOSE ENDS.

36:13.041 --> 36:15.542
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT I CAN DO

36:15.583 --> 36:17.792
OR DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS?

36:17.834 --> 36:19.792
LILLIE TOLD ME
HOW KIND YOU WERE.

36:19.834 --> 36:22.500
SHE TOLD ME YOU OFFERED
TO CARE FOR MILO.

36:22.542 --> 36:25.834
SHE WANTED ME TO THANK YOU.
I WAS GLAD I COULD HELP.

36:25.875 --> 36:29.041
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO IMPOSE
ON YOU ANY FURTHER.

36:29.083 --> 36:30.959
IT WASN'T HER WAY.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.375
I'VE COME TO TAKE MILO
HOME WITH ME.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.875
(laughing)

36:51.583 --> 36:53.041
(laughs)

36:53.083 --> 36:54.667
(continues laughing)

36:54.709 --> 36:57.041
EX-EXACTLY WHAT DO YOU FIND
SO FUNNY?

36:57.083 --> 36:59.041
I'M SORRY.

36:59.083 --> 37:02.041
IT'S THE FACT THAT I
DREAMED UP THIS HUGE TRAUMA

37:02.083 --> 37:05.458
THAT TURNED OUT
TO BE NICENESS. (laughing)

37:05.500 --> 37:08.458
THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY COULD
DISLIKE SOMEBODY ELSE SO MUCH

37:08.500 --> 37:10.834
THAT SHE'D PRETEND
NOT TO REMEMBER HIM...

37:10.875 --> 37:12.375
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

37:12.417 --> 37:15.375
OH, I WASN'T, YOU KNOW,
I WASN'T GONNA TELL YOU THIS,

37:15.417 --> 37:17.375
BUT I ACTUALLY--
I THOUGHT THAT... (laughs)

37:17.417 --> 37:20.375
I THOUGHT THAT JIMMY
MIGHT HAVE KILLED HER FATHER.

37:20.417 --> 37:23.083
OH, IT'S SAD, ISN'T IT--

37:23.125 --> 37:26.375
THE LENGTHS WE GO TO...
PEOPLE?
SAD FOR JIMMY.

37:26.417 --> 37:29.875
OH, POOR, NICE JIMMY.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.709
WE HAVE TO TELL HIM.
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.709
YOU WANT TO BREAK HIS HEART
MORE HONESTLY?

37:34.750 --> 37:38.250
'CAUSE EITHER WAY, BARBARA
DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM.

37:38.291 --> 37:41.000
IS THAT HOW IT IS FOR YOU
WITH ME?

37:43.083 --> 37:45.542
NO, DON'T ANSWER THAT.

37:45.583 --> 37:48.041
JUST DON'T SAY WHAT YOU THINK,
FOR ONCE.

37:48.083 --> 37:49.709
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

37:49.750 --> 37:52.041
COME ON, PETE. WE'RE JUST...

37:52.083 --> 37:54.458
WE'RE LAUGHING.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.000
WE'RE HAVING FUN.

38:00.417 --> 38:02.875
SO... WE LIE TO JIMMY.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.750
WE LIE TO JIMMY.

38:07.875 --> 38:11.834
YOU'RE
A VERY PERSUASIVE WOMAN...

38:11.875 --> 38:15.041
BUT NOT A PARTICULARLY
FAR-SIGHTED DOCTOR.

38:15.083 --> 38:18.041
SCIENCE IS ABOUT PROGRESS.

38:18.083 --> 38:19.709
AND TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

38:19.750 --> 38:21.959
THESE KIND OF CHOICES
WILL BE COMMONPLACE,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL.

38:24.041 --> 38:26.000
THERE ARE LIMITS
TO WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

38:26.041 --> 38:29.000
AND I GUESS HERE,
YOU GET TO DECIDE.

38:30.583 --> 38:32.000
YOU DON'T LIKE ME.

38:32.041 --> 38:35.375
NO. NO, I DON'T.

38:35.417 --> 38:37.041
I DIDN'T LIKE YOU EITHER.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.792
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,
GORGEOUS, REALLY,

38:38.834 --> 38:41.041
AND VERY,
VERY ANNOYINGLY TALL.

38:41.083 --> 38:44.041
BUT THE FACT THAT YOU WERE
A BIG, GIANT FATTY

38:44.083 --> 38:46.917
MAKES ME LIKE YOU
JUST A LITTLE BIT NOW.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.625
THERE ARE CHINKS
IN THAT ARMOR.

38:48.667 --> 38:50.917
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
A COMPLIMENT?

38:50.959 --> 38:52.500
UH, ACTUALLY, YES.

38:52.542 --> 38:54.750
BUT DON'T FEEL TOO GOOD
ABOUT IT.

38:54.792 --> 38:58.000
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED TODAY.

38:58.041 --> 39:01.000
BUT THE DONOVANS--THEY DIDN'T
GET WHAT THEY WANTED.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.417
AND I'LL CALL YOU
AFTER I GET THE RESULTS

39:09.458 --> 39:10.917
OF THE C.T. UROGRAM.

39:10.959 --> 39:12.041
(man) OKAY.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.041
HI.
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?

39:14.083 --> 39:16.041
I DIDN'T BARGE IN
AND START YELLING.

39:16.083 --> 39:18.041
I WAITED FOR YOU TO FINISH

39:18.083 --> 39:20.041
BECAUSE I RESPECT YOU
PROFESSIONALLY.
WELL, YAY FOR YOU.

39:20.083 --> 39:22.041
AND THAT WASN'T
A PITY PATIENT.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.625
THAT'S WHAT, IN DOCTOR CIRCLES,
IS CALLED A REFERRAL,

39:24.667 --> 39:27.625
THE PROPER RESPONSE TO WHICH IS,
"THANK YOU, DR. FREEDMAN,

39:27.667 --> 39:30.125
FOR REFERRING ME
THIS INTERESTING CASE."
OH, I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU, COOPER.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.125
THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL
LIKE A FAILURE.

39:32.166 --> 39:35.000
IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH THAT
I FAILED AT PACIFIC WELLCARE.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.208
NOW MY BOYFRIEND'S

39:36.250 --> 39:38.333
WRANGLING ME PATIENTS
