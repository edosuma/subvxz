00:00.033 --> 00:01.734
You made a loan to him
for a birthday party.

00:01.800 --> 00:03.500
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Nope.

00:03.567 --> 00:05.666
Uh, I actually have the text message.

00:05.734 --> 00:07.466
No, Your Honor,
I don't know where that came from.

00:07.533 --> 00:10.367
If you click the circle in the top,
you could call it.

00:10.432 --> 00:11.933
[phone rings]

00:12.199 --> 00:14.132
You don't know where that came from?!

00:14.199 --> 00:16.399
That's your number.
Shame, shame on you.

00:16.466 --> 00:18.667
[announcer] This is Judy Justice.

[announcer] Social media influencer
Stephanie Landor

00:39.399 --> 00:41.966
is suing her friend Malik Earnest

00:42.033 --> 00:43.734
for a birthday party loan.

00:44.165 --> 00:45.933
[Kevin] Court come to order,
all rise.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.633
Have a seat please.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.466
-Hello, Judge.
-How are you?

00:51.533 --> 00:54.265
Case 1099. Landor vs. Earnest.

00:54.332 --> 00:55.767
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:55.834 --> 00:58.366
Miss Landor, the defendant
was a friend of yours?

00:58.432 --> 01:00.432
And it is your claim that
you made a loan to him

01:00.500 --> 01:02.799
-for a birthday party of his.
-Yes, Your Honor.

01:02.866 --> 01:05.432
[Judy] The defendant says
there was never a loan,

01:05.500 --> 01:08.900
you decided to make this party
so that you could enhance a--

01:08.966 --> 01:12.466
some sort of a social media site
that you have.

01:12.533 --> 01:15.900
And that you could use that
because somehow,

01:15.966 --> 01:18.132
and I know people have tried to explain
this to me

01:18.200 --> 01:21.200
there are people on the internet
who they call "influencers."

01:21.265 --> 01:22.533
[Malik] Correct.

01:22.599 --> 01:26.000
Sarah had tried to explain that to me
that means that just because

01:26.066 --> 01:28.700
you're a person,
you try to make yourself interesting

01:28.766 --> 01:31.132
so a lot of people
watch what you do.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.233
Like what you eat,
when you go to the bathroom,

01:34.299 --> 01:36.567
-[audience laughs]
-when you have your teeth fixed,

01:36.633 --> 01:38.766
and when you brush your hair.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.200
And what you're having for lunch.

01:40.265 --> 01:43.734
And people come to watch that.

01:43.799 --> 01:47.799
And then other folks who are in business
say, "Oh, well, we can...

01:47.866 --> 01:52.834
Since people are interested in
what Miss Landor eats for lunch,

01:52.900 --> 01:56.900
we can advertise on her site where
she posts what she eats for lunch."

01:56.966 --> 01:59.233
Let me get--
Understand if I'm getting this right.

01:59.299 --> 02:00.500
That's right.

02:00.566 --> 02:05.632
[Judy] "And since a million people
are interested in what she has for lunch,

02:05.700 --> 02:07.533
or when she's having her teeth cleaned,

02:07.599 --> 02:10.866
we're gonna advertise
our product on that site

02:10.967 --> 02:14.766
so it's gonna pop up when somebody
watches her with the hygienist."

02:14.834 --> 02:16.033
Am I getting that right?

02:16.099 --> 02:18.099
-Yes. the gist.
-Pretty much. Anyway.

02:18.165 --> 02:22.000
Mr. Earnest says there was never a loan,
you paid for the party

02:22.066 --> 02:25.966
because you took advantage of the party,
the venue and everything else

02:26.033 --> 02:29.199
to put on your site.

02:29.265 --> 02:30.766
I read the case.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.033
So did Sarah,

02:32.099 --> 02:36.834
and since she has far more
acumen with the machine than I do,

02:36.900 --> 02:41.233
she actually brought up pictures
of the birthday party.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.599
-It was a yellow-themed birthday party.
-Correct.

02:43.667 --> 02:44.766
-Yellow and black.
-[Judy] Hmm?

02:44.834 --> 02:46.432
Yellow and black, correct.
Two of my favorite colors.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.834
What do you do for a living, sir?

02:47.900 --> 02:49.233
Uh, I'm a helicopter reporter.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.966
For local news.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.165
How long have you been doing that?

02:52.233 --> 02:54.800
Uh, two and half years in this position.

02:54.866 --> 02:56.233
What do you make a year?

02:56.300 --> 02:57.834
[chuckles] You want me
to answer that out loud?

02:57.900 --> 02:59.667
I want you to answer a question.

02:59.734 --> 03:01.599
Uh, upwards of 80K.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.800
Can I have a number please?
K is...

03:04.866 --> 03:07.699
-[Malik] 80,000. Upwards of 80,000.
-So you make $80,000 a year.

03:07.766 --> 03:09.265
-Correct.
-[Judy] Who do you live with?

03:09.332 --> 03:10.532
Uh, my parents.

03:10.599 --> 03:12.300
-[Judy] Do you pay them rent?
-Nope.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.032
-[Judy] Do you have a car?
-Yup.

03:14.099 --> 03:17.165
-[Judy] What kind? "Yup" is not an answer.
-A Mustang, Judge Judy.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.366
Yes. that's very good.

03:19.432 --> 03:22.800
-You have a Mustang. All paid for?
-Nope. I still pay for that vehicle.

03:22.866 --> 03:24.633
"Nope" is not an answer.
"No, I still pay for it."

03:24.699 --> 03:25.667
[Malik] No, ma'am,
I still pay for the car.

03:25.734 --> 03:27.966
Very good.
And how much is your car payment?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.233
-$400 a month.
-[Judy] What else do you pay for?

03:30.300 --> 03:32.633
[Malik] I pay for my family's cellphone,

03:32.699 --> 03:36.400
I pay for my own food. [chuckles]
Day to day expenses.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.933
Uh, help out the parents with expenses,
anything else they need.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.766
In addition to also helping out friends
when they're also with financial trouble.

03:42.834 --> 03:43.900
-[Judy] Okay.
-[Malik] Occasionally.

03:43.966 --> 03:45.834
-[Judy] And you have a bank account?
-[Malik] Correct.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.500
[Judy] Your birthday
was in May of this year.

03:48.567 --> 03:49.599
-Yup.
-[Judy] Yup is not an answer.

03:49.667 --> 03:50.633
-Yes is an answer.
-Yes, Judge Judy.

03:50.699 --> 03:51.933
You have a bank account.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.667
And your bank balance was what
in May of this year?

03:54.734 --> 03:56.633
I want you to take a look
on your phone

03:56.699 --> 03:58.699
because you should have your
bank balance on your phone.

03:58.766 --> 04:01.467
Because I know Sarah checks
her bank balance every day.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.667
-At least twice a day.
-[Malik] Right.

04:02.734 --> 04:06.633
So I know people of you generation check
their phone and their bank balance

04:06.699 --> 04:09.066
and who's contacting them
or whatever.

04:09.133 --> 04:12.667
Are you looking for a total
of my entire bank account on that day?

04:12.734 --> 04:14.599
Yeah. A total!

04:14.667 --> 04:15.834
That's gonna take a while
to scroll far down

04:15.900 --> 04:17.834
past all of my expenses.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.199
But I can give you
an estimate of what it was.

04:19.266 --> 04:23.065
No, I want to know what your bank account
balance was on...

04:23.132 --> 04:25.033
let's say, the beginning of May.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.800
I can give you an estimate,
which was around $20,000.

04:27.867 --> 04:28.934
I'd like to see it.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.132
I can't provide that to you right now.
I don't have...

04:31.199 --> 04:33.933
the capability of scrolling--
I don't know how to find it,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
like, go through the bank.
I don't check like that.

04:36.066 --> 04:39.199
Oh, well, give your phone to Sarah,
she'll scroll it and find it for me.

04:39.266 --> 04:41.233
Do you understand?
Find it!

04:41.300 --> 04:43.066
[Malik] Your Honor, is there anything else
I can provide you with?

04:43.132 --> 04:44.766
Besides sitting here
to look for these statements?

04:44.834 --> 04:46.867
I really cannot find them on this app.

04:46.933 --> 04:48.033
That's all I need.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.632
I mean, I don't wanna see
a birthday list. I wanna see...

04:50.699 --> 04:53.500
Right. What would those statements prove,
Your Honor?

04:53.567 --> 04:55.466
I don't answer your questions, sir.

04:55.533 --> 04:56.867
-You answer my questions.
-[Malik] Correct.

04:56.933 --> 05:01.600
I want to see your bank balance
in May of 2021.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.300
Oh, well, look at that.
You got your phone?

05:03.367 --> 05:05.065
-And he's looking for his?
-Yes.

05:05.132 --> 05:07.500
-[Judy] I want to see your bank balance
in May of 2021.

05:07.567 --> 05:08.466
Okay. No worries.

05:09.033 --> 05:11.466
Sarah, would you bring up on your computer

05:12.065 --> 05:14.100
videos that you found about this party?

05:14.266 --> 05:15.266
I'll see.

05:15.333 --> 05:18.000
I'm trying for it to load,
Your Honor.

05:18.065 --> 05:19.000
[whispering] Great.

05:19.065 --> 05:20.432
[Sarah] The app's just loading.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.632
We're all fighting
for internet use here, so...

05:22.699 --> 05:24.899
-Correct.
-[Judy] Should be able to get that.

05:24.966 --> 05:25.966
In this room.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.867
It's a high-tech operation here.

05:29.934 --> 05:32.233
[audience laughs]

05:32.300 --> 05:36.733
So my exact balance
for the first of May

05:36.800 --> 05:40.000
was $11,201.

05:41.367 --> 05:42.399
And 13 cents.

05:42.466 --> 05:47.567
Now I want you to tell me about
a withdrawal on that date.

05:47.632 --> 05:49.500
-[Stephanie] Yeah.
-For $4,000.

05:49.567 --> 05:52.266
I actually have the receipt
from the transaction.

05:52.332 --> 05:55.165
-[Judy] I'd like to see it.
-I have a printed copy if you'd like that.

05:55.233 --> 05:56.399
[whispering] I would like to see it.

05:56.466 --> 05:57.699
[Stephanie] And I have this.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.899
And here's the statements as well.

06:01.966 --> 06:06.533
This is the $1000 that was spent on a
Cinnabon truck for his birthday party.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.966
Shh. Just a second.

06:08.033 --> 06:08.966
No worries.

06:11.333 --> 06:12.500
Keep looking.

06:12.867 --> 06:13.867
Yes, ma'am.

06:13.934 --> 06:15.266
I'm still looking right now.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.132
She's just more adept than you are,
is that what we're talking about?

06:18.199 --> 06:20.300
She probably has better cellphone service
than I do in here.

06:20.367 --> 06:21.899
What kind of cellphone do you have?

06:21.966 --> 06:23.500
An iPhone Thir-- Twelve.

06:23.567 --> 06:24.800
Pro Max.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.199
I'm sure not.

06:27.132 --> 06:28.165
Eleven, Your Honor.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.432
[theme music plays]

06:31.165 --> 06:32.600
I have that video for you.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.367
[announcer] And later today...

06:44.432 --> 06:47.533
The accident was a result of a deer
running out in front of you

06:47.600 --> 06:49.533
-You hitting a deer in the road?
-Correct.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.033
Oh, you hit the deer because
you were texting.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.600
-Yeah, and I wonder who I was texting.
-Shh! I don't care who you were texting.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.066
You're the idiot driving.

06:56.132 --> 06:57.533
[laughter]

07:06.966 --> 07:10.233
[announcer] Social media influencer
Stephanie Landor

07:10.300 --> 07:15.567
says her friend Malik Earnest
is responsible for a loan she gave Malik

07:15.632 --> 07:17.533
for his birthday party.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.699
Okay. What was the name of the venue
that the birthday party was at?

07:20.766 --> 07:22.533
Um, I don't know what
the name of the venue was

07:22.600 --> 07:24.500
where he had his birthday party
because he just asked me

07:24.567 --> 07:26.000
to take out the money for him.

07:26.065 --> 07:27.800
And then we went to the venue after.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.766
-[Judy] And the party was the same day?
-[Stephanie] Yes, correct.

07:30.834 --> 07:33.233
[Judy]
Who planned this yellow theme?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.567
Malik Earnest did, Your Honor.

07:34.632 --> 07:36.266
[Judy]
How many people were at the party?

07:36.332 --> 07:39.066
I would like to say
upwards of 100 people attended.

07:39.132 --> 07:40.867
I have that video for you,
Your Honor.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.199
I'd like to take a look at it.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.233
There's music as well but...

07:47.300 --> 07:48.766
I don't think you need it.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.399
And then it just replays.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.834
Okay, so there's a car in the middle of
the road that's yellow.

08:12.899 --> 08:16.867
And you're saying "I bet you can't guess
what my favorite color is..."

08:16.934 --> 08:20.033
That was actually for
a content collaboration day.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.399
-Was this at the birthday party?
-[Stephanie] No.

08:21.466 --> 08:22.533
Not in any way. None.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.867
-[Judy] It was not.
-No.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.000
-This?
-From the same day.

08:25.065 --> 08:26.300
[Stephanie]
Yes, now that was for...

08:26.367 --> 08:28.266
-So this was the same day?
-a photo collaboration that I did.

08:28.332 --> 08:31.165
Okay. Did you do anything with the party?

08:31.266 --> 08:34.834
No. I just attended and I loaned him
the money the day of the party.

08:34.899 --> 08:35.899
Just a second.

08:35.966 --> 08:38.567
You didn't post any pictures
of the party?

08:38.633 --> 08:41.200
I don't think I have.
I might have it on my SnapChat.

08:41.265 --> 08:43.500
If you'd like,
I could scroll to that date--

08:43.567 --> 08:46.567
-No. Here!
-This is on the same day, May 8th,

08:46.633 --> 08:48.667
-she posted it.
-I can get the images from that.

08:48.734 --> 08:51.133
It was a photoshoot that I did
for a Smilez.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.232
Okay. But you didn't do posts on this...
site, whatever it is,

08:55.299 --> 08:57.100
any video of the party.

08:57.165 --> 08:59.533
Uh, I think I do have
a video of the party.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.066
-If you'd like, I could get that for you.
-Yeah.

09:02.133 --> 09:03.966
Uh, I haven't received my phone back.

09:04.033 --> 09:05.265
Oh. [laughs]

09:05.332 --> 09:07.466
[Stephanie laughs]

09:07.533 --> 09:08.966
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-And Your Honor, I have my bank statement.

09:09.033 --> 09:10.700
And how much was in the account?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.866
The bank I was using during that time was

09:12.933 --> 09:16.432
on May 1st, $4,532.10.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.700
And what is the current balance
in that account?

09:18.767 --> 09:20.033
Uh, I don't use this account anymore.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.799
-The current balance would be...
-[Judy] Just a second!

09:21.866 --> 09:23.799
$662.17

09:23.866 --> 09:26.000
[Judy]
There were 100 people at the party.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.767
When were the 100 people
notified about the party?

09:28.833 --> 09:31.033
Uh, about two and a half weeks
in advance

09:31.100 --> 09:33.600
via an invite that was sent to them.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.432
Do you have a copy of that evite?

09:35.500 --> 09:36.966
-Find it on your phone.
-[Malik] I do.

09:37.033 --> 09:38.133
Uh, Your Honor?

09:38.200 --> 09:41.933
Uh, I found videos on my Instagram story
dated May 7th

09:42.000 --> 09:45.265
from Smilez, which is the event
in which I had the photoshoot.

09:45.332 --> 09:47.432
His birthday party occurred
on the 8th of May.

09:47.500 --> 09:52.633
Okay, great. So the only thing that was
posted on the 8th of May

09:52.700 --> 09:54.799
was anything that
had to do with the party.

09:54.866 --> 09:56.799
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay, you're gonna find that

09:56.866 --> 09:58.500
and you're gonna get me
a copy of the evite.

09:58.567 --> 09:59.966
-Correct.
-Have it?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.633
[Malik] No, ma'am,
I'm still waiting for it to load.

10:01.700 --> 10:05.399
I just put up the RSVP.
I'm seconds away from getting the invite.

10:05.466 --> 10:07.000
[Judy]
Who arranged for the evite?

10:07.066 --> 10:09.432
-I did.
-[Judy] Okay. through what company?

10:09.500 --> 10:12.567
Uh, I designed the flier and sent it out.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.700
Everybody filled out a Google form,
which is how we were

10:14.767 --> 10:17.133
accumulating names
for the list for entry.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.700
Okay, so you designed it.

10:18.767 --> 10:21.399
-Correct.
-[Judy] The RSVPs came back to you.

10:21.466 --> 10:22.332
Correct.

10:22.399 --> 10:23.933
What was the name of the venue?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.432
Um...

10:25.500 --> 10:26.633
They didn't really have a name.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.866
It's a venue that is over
in North Hollywood.

10:28.933 --> 10:30.833
Well, there had to be an address
on your evite.

10:30.899 --> 10:32.667
Correct, and I'm pulling that up
for you right now.

10:32.734 --> 10:33.734
[Stephanie] Your Honor...

10:33.799 --> 10:37.133
Uh, I actually have the text message
of Malik Earnest inviting me

10:37.200 --> 10:38.899
-to his birthday party.
-[Judy] May I see it please?

10:38.966 --> 10:42.000
This is a lot of text messages.
You can scroll, everything is there.

10:50.866 --> 10:53.366
-[Judy] Oh. Mr. Earnest.
-Yes, Your Honor.

10:53.432 --> 10:56.066
Your defense to this case is that--

10:56.133 --> 10:59.600
I'm reading your answer, that she wants to
throw you a memorable birthday.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.866
-Correct.
-[Judy] She says in her complaint

11:02.933 --> 11:05.767
you ran into some banking trouble,
she was with you,

11:05.833 --> 11:07.899
you needed money to pay the venue

11:07.966 --> 11:10.066
and she advanced you the money.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.633
And you say that that's not true.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.533
-That is not true.
-Okay.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.332
On May 10th, two days after
she withdrew the money,

11:17.399 --> 11:19.500
and gave it to pay for the venue,

11:19.567 --> 11:20.899
she says to you,

11:20.966 --> 11:23.734
"Hey, did you figure out
any banking stuff yet?"

11:23.799 --> 11:27.966
And you reply, "Yes, I'm waiting on a call
from them to tell me

11:28.033 --> 11:29.767
why my account is suspended.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.332
And what I need to do
to get it taken care of.

11:32.399 --> 11:35.165
I'm hoping to have it
resolved this week

11:35.232 --> 11:37.299
and you paid ASAP!"

11:37.366 --> 11:39.165
No, Your Honor, I don't know
where that came from.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.033
And Your Honor,
I also have an audio message of him--

11:41.100 --> 11:43.165
[Judy] Just a second!
You don't know where that came from?!

11:43.232 --> 11:48.033
It came from you, Malik Earnest.
I see your picture over here.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.567
-That's correct. That's me.
-And so, that comes from you.

11:50.633 --> 11:52.332
-No, ma'am.
-[Judy] Oh, yeah.

11:52.399 --> 11:55.232
"Not me having to make an emergency trip

11:55.299 --> 11:58.432
to LA tomorrow to go back to
that damn bank.

11:58.500 --> 12:02.066
I am AO RIP."
I don't know what that means.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.734
"That's my update for today."

12:04.799 --> 12:06.232
If you click the circle in the top,

12:06.299 --> 12:07.767
you could see the phone number.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.366
-And either call it or confirm the number.
-Oh!

12:09.432 --> 12:10.700
[Stephanie] If you could call,
his phone will ring.

12:10.767 --> 12:11.633
Where? Show me.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.166
Unless he has it turned off.

12:14.232 --> 12:16.866
My phone is on. And I'm sure it will ring
because that is my number.

12:16.933 --> 12:18.166
-Yes
-[Sarah] And that will call it.

12:18.232 --> 12:20.100
But where did those
text messages come from?

12:20.166 --> 12:21.833
From your phone number, sir.

12:21.899 --> 12:23.700
"Sir." Right.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.734
-What's happening?
-It's calling.

12:26.299 --> 12:28.033
Oh, yeah, that's your number.

12:29.432 --> 12:32.265
Okay. How much did you give him
for the party?

12:32.332 --> 12:33.866
Shame, shame on you, Mr. Earnest.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.899
-For what, Your Honor?
-[Judy] You have family.

12:35.966 --> 12:37.899
They probably watch you,
you're a big fibber.

12:37.966 --> 12:41.432
You say, "I'm gonna try to figure out
what happened to my bank.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.899
-And I'll get it back to you ASAP."
-Your Honor, what does my personal

12:42.966 --> 12:45.232
financial status have to do with
her giving me money?

12:45.299 --> 12:46.667
No, that's what you said to her.

12:46.734 --> 12:48.767
-[Stephanie] Giving me money.
-That's what you said to her.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.100
What does my personal financial status
have to do with her

12:51.232 --> 12:53.500
choosing to give me money for a party
that she wanted to throw me?

12:53.567 --> 12:55.033
Didn't you understand what I said to you?

12:55.100 --> 12:56.767
I read to you what you wrote to her.

12:56.834 --> 13:00.600
She says that she went to the bank,
you tried to cash a check

13:00.667 --> 13:03.000
or get money out to pay the venue.

13:03.066 --> 13:06.265
They suspended your account,
that's what you wrote in her complaint.

13:06.332 --> 13:07.166
-It was while she was in the car with
me. -[Judy] Just-- Don't speak!

13:08.633 --> 13:11.299
For some reason,
they suspended your account,

13:11.366 --> 13:13.232
she took money out,
gave it to you.

13:13.299 --> 13:17.700
Your answer says that she wanted to make
you a big bash for your birthday.

13:17.767 --> 13:21.700
Your answer to her two days
after the party was,

13:21.767 --> 13:24.166
"Yes, I'm waiting on a call for them
to tell me why

13:24.232 --> 13:26.166
my account is suspended.

13:26.232 --> 13:29.533
And what I need to do
to get it taken care of.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.100
I'm hoping to have it
all resolved this week

13:32.165 --> 13:34.000
and you paid ASAP."

13:34.066 --> 13:36.899
And the reason they
didn't give you the money,

13:36.966 --> 13:41.100
was because you had just a couple of bucks
more than what you were asking for.

13:41.165 --> 13:43.567
You had $4,432.

13:43.633 --> 13:46.432
That was the reason why I asked you
what was in your bank account.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.799
Do you understand?

13:47.866 --> 13:49.033
-I understand but--
-Very good!

13:49.100 --> 13:50.799
I don't believe a word you're saying,
Mr. Earnest.

13:50.866 --> 13:53.265
-[theme music plays]
-[audience chuckles]

13:53.332 --> 13:55.033
[announcer] And later today...

13:55.100 --> 13:57.033
-Show me. Show me!
-I don't have anything to show you.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.866
My phone actually broke, so...

13:58.933 --> 14:02.567
You know how many people
in 26 years had broken phones?

14:02.633 --> 14:06.332
Always the ones who need--
who need a phone.

14:10.899 --> 14:13.299
[theme music plays]

14:17.734 --> 14:20.767
[announcer] Social media influencer
Stephanie Landor

14:20.833 --> 14:24.200
says her friend Malik Earnest
is responsible for

14:24.265 --> 14:27.332
a loan she gave Malik
for his birthday party.

14:27.399 --> 14:30.000
Okay. I don't believe a word you're
saying, Mr. Earnest.

14:30.066 --> 14:33.100
Judging for the plaintiff
in the amount of six thou-- just a second.

14:33.165 --> 14:36.600
I'm taking off the 500 that you said,
that he said he would give you

14:36.667 --> 14:38.600
because it's usurious interest.

14:38.667 --> 14:43.265
But you gave him 4,000 and another 1,500
to pay for the donut truck or some--

14:43.332 --> 14:45.165
-I also have audio of him...
-It was a Cinnabon truck.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.667
[Judy] Some other stupidity.

14:46.734 --> 14:49.265
That's $5,500.
Judgment for the plaintiff.

14:49.332 --> 14:51.100
-Goodbye!
-[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

14:51.165 --> 14:52.232
Thank you.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
If she wanted me to sit up there and lie,
I could've done that.

14:55.567 --> 14:56.667
But I told her the truth.

14:56.734 --> 14:59.734
It definitely hurts me,
the fact that he went against me

14:59.799 --> 15:02.500
when I did him a huge favor
when nobody else would.

15:02.567 --> 15:03.600
We're best friends, actually.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.966
Today was our four-year anniversary
of being friends.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.633
We've actually been friends for six years.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.332
I just wish that things hadn't end up
on such a bad note.

15:10.399 --> 15:12.133
I want nothing to do with somebody

15:12.200 --> 15:15.033
who cares more about a party
than the well-being of somebody else.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.667
I always said that
the best part of having children

15:18.734 --> 15:20.734
was having grandchildren, so...

15:20.799 --> 15:22.366
I'm going to give you a thank you.

15:22.432 --> 15:27.667
Because my generation being
brought into this social media

15:27.734 --> 15:30.567
would never have happened
if we didn't have young people

15:30.633 --> 15:32.232
that we were around so much.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.899
I still don't understand why people find
it interesting to see what

15:35.966 --> 15:37.633
somebody else is having for lunch.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.700
I think it's just the need
for constant content.

15:40.767 --> 15:43.667
You know, kids are on their phones
all the time.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.265
And when you ask,
"What are you looking at?"

15:45.332 --> 15:46.667
They need something at look at.

15:46.734 --> 15:51.000
So hence, content creators, influencers,
just takes up time in the day.

15:51.066 --> 15:52.834
You think that's a good thing, Sarah?

15:52.899 --> 15:54.066
-Think about it.
-It's good.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.200
If you're on the right end of it,
if you have a message

15:56.265 --> 15:59.834
that's important, that you think you want
to share with your millions of followers,

15:59.899 --> 16:01.533
I think it can be positive.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.799
But I think it's also sucking
the younger generation

16:04.866 --> 16:06.600
into their phones more and more

16:06.667 --> 16:09.232
-for hours.
-Well, and not being social.

16:09.299 --> 16:11.366
-Not being out there.
-It's a different kind of social.

16:11.432 --> 16:13.899
It's a different kind
of interaction that is

16:13.966 --> 16:16.166
very unfamiliar to your generation,
I think.

16:16.232 --> 16:17.767
Well, it's really isolating.

16:17.833 --> 16:20.265
When I go out to dinner with Poppy,

16:20.332 --> 16:21.432
and sometimes I look around,

16:21.500 --> 16:23.833
and there are groups
of four and six people.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.567
They're all at dinner
and all on their phones.

16:26.633 --> 16:29.200
Nobody is communicating.
They're so used to using that

16:29.265 --> 16:32.299
as a form of communication.
There's no... social interaction.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.000
-I think... the whole thing is horrifying.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

16:35.066 --> 16:39.133
I think that if you have to think about
what human beings

16:39.200 --> 16:41.033
are gonna look like in...

16:41.100 --> 16:43.667
200 years, they're gonna have
very little fingers

16:43.734 --> 16:46.165
and all have big thumbs
because that's the way

16:46.232 --> 16:48.133
people-- that's the way--

16:48.200 --> 16:50.165
They're gonna become... useless!

16:50.232 --> 16:53.133
Useless. The only thing--
there's gonna be mitts.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.533
-And a big thumb.
-[chuckles]

16:54.600 --> 16:55.966
[Judy]
Anyway, the whole thing is frightening.

16:56.633 --> 16:59.000
Case 1086. Linton vs. Farah.

16:59.066 --> 17:01.133
All parties, please step forward.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.866
[announcer] Trevor Linton
is suing his former girlfriend

17:04.933 --> 17:07.532
Caitlin Farah for unpaid loans.

17:07.599 --> 17:11.733
Mr. Linton, you met the defendant
on a dating app?

17:11.799 --> 17:14.232
-Yes, I did.
-In what month and year?

17:14.299 --> 17:16.066
Um, October, 2019.

17:16.133 --> 17:17.467
And when did you start to date?

17:17.532 --> 17:21.400
Um, officially, our first date
was October 25th, 2019.

17:21.467 --> 17:23.232
Is your claim that you made a loan to her?

17:23.299 --> 17:24.232
Yes.

17:24.299 --> 17:27.066
[Judy] And the loan was because
she had an accident with her car?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.599
-That is correct, Your Honor.
-[Judy] When was that?

17:28.666 --> 17:31.767
You don't have to bend down.
The microphone will pick up your speaking.

17:31.834 --> 17:32.799
Okay.

17:32.866 --> 17:35.432
Um, the accident was December of 2019.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.066
And the accident was a result of
a deer running out in front of you?

17:39.133 --> 17:40.933
-You hitting a deer in the road?
-Correct.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.200
[Judy]
And your car was substantially damaged.

17:43.266 --> 17:45.299
-Yes.
-Didn't have money to fix the car?

17:45.366 --> 17:46.767
Not at the moment, no.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.599
Tell me, Mr. Linton,
how you found out that

17:49.666 --> 17:52.500
Miss Farah needed money
to fix her car.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.967
So she texted me, uh, in a panic.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.567
-[Judy] Do you have the text?
-[Trevor] Yes, I do, Your Honor.

17:56.633 --> 17:58.232
[Judy]
I'd like to a look at it.

17:58.299 --> 18:00.467
And then she also states
why she hit the deer.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.432
[Judy] Oh, you hit the deer
'cause you were texting.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.467
-Yeah, and I wonder who I was texting.
-[Judy] Shh!

18:10.532 --> 18:12.165
-[laughs]
-I don't care who you were texting,

18:12.232 --> 18:13.467
you're the idiot driving.

18:13.532 --> 18:15.000
[laughs]

18:16.099 --> 18:19.567
-What happened to the deer?
-It actually got up and walked away.

18:19.633 --> 18:22.733
[Judy] Okay. So did you take the car
to your uncle's shop?

18:22.799 --> 18:24.733
-I did.
-And how much was it to fix it?

18:24.799 --> 18:27.700
Um, it was 1,560.84.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.767
[Judy] And did you borrow the money
from the plaintiff?

18:29.834 --> 18:31.733
Uh... yes.

18:31.799 --> 18:33.500
[Judy] Yeah, but that's--

18:33.567 --> 18:35.799
It's either a yes, you borrowed
the money from the plaintiff,

18:35.866 --> 18:38.232
or "No, I didn't borrow the money
from the plaintiff."

18:38.299 --> 18:41.633
But, Miss Farah, what I'm gonna tell you
is, according to the plaintiff,

18:41.700 --> 18:45.299
you repaid part of this 1,560.84.

18:45.366 --> 18:47.133
Correct. So I repaid what we agreed on.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.567
Okay. So you borrowed the money from him.

18:49.633 --> 18:53.532
Correct. And I've read your answer.
And I've read his complaint,

18:53.599 --> 18:56.733
and you paid 800 and some-odd dollars

18:56.799 --> 18:58.266
-back to him.
-Correct.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.767
So you paid him back approximately half.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.333
Of what we agreed on.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.165
Don't interrupt me. Again.
It's annoying.

19:08.066 --> 19:12.066
And she would like the balance.
And your defense is...

19:12.133 --> 19:14.834
that you were only supposed to
pay back half.

19:14.900 --> 19:17.200
-Mm-hmm.
-"Uh-huh" is not an answer.

19:17.266 --> 19:18.432
-Yes is an answer.
-[Caitlin] Yes, Your Honor.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.532
That's better. Okay.
Now, that's her defense.

19:21.599 --> 19:24.432
You agreed when you
originally made the loan,

19:24.500 --> 19:26.599
agreed to accept half as payment.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.767
She paid back half.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.366
-You broke up.
-Yes.

19:29.432 --> 19:31.200
[Judy]
She continued to make certain payments.

19:31.266 --> 19:32.900
And then dropped off the face of the Earth

19:32.967 --> 19:34.532
and blocked your number,
that's what you say.

19:34.599 --> 19:35.567
That is not correct.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.900
Did she block your number?

19:36.967 --> 19:38.000
I have no idea.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.933
Did she drop off the face of your Earth?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.032
[Trevor] No, she still...

19:41.099 --> 19:42.432
she would randomly communicate

19:42.500 --> 19:44.400
that she was going to send me a check

19:44.467 --> 19:47.400
or a Western Union wire
and would-- and did not.

19:47.467 --> 19:49.767
And our agreement was for the full amount,
not half.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.767
Do you have any evidence of that?

19:51.834 --> 19:53.099
-[Trevor] Yes.
-Great.

19:53.165 --> 19:58.633
So I have this evidence, Your Honor,
stating when I offered to help her,

19:58.700 --> 20:00.165
-she states...
-Uh, just a second.

20:00.232 --> 20:01.666
-Can I read them please?
-[Trevor] Okay. Yeah.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.232
And then she states how long it's gonna
take her to pay me back

20:04.299 --> 20:05.933
on the last-- last one.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
Thank you.

20:12.866 --> 20:16.066
Okay, so you told him you would pay him
back 100 dollars a month.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.666
Correct. Until I paid that 825.

20:18.733 --> 20:21.532
No, that's not correct.
Because you say,

20:21.599 --> 20:24.032
"It would only take me
like a year and a half

20:24.099 --> 20:25.232
to pay you back."

20:25.299 --> 20:27.799
-But he verbally told me that--
-[Judy] No, no, no, no, no.

20:27.866 --> 20:30.066
-Okay.
-That's what you said to him.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.333
-"It would only take me...
-[Caitlin] Mm-hmm.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.567
Like a year and a half."

20:33.633 --> 20:36.532
A year and a half at $100 a month,

20:36.599 --> 20:40.066
is not $800. I mean,
I'm not very good at math.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.599
Math was never my family's strong suit.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.500
But a year and a half, at a $100

20:44.567 --> 20:47.000
is more than $800.

20:47.066 --> 20:48.666
But he said that after that.

20:48.733 --> 20:50.099
[Judy]
Oh, well, show me.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.567
He's got a whole bunch of stuff here.
I don't see it.

20:52.633 --> 20:54.000
And I don't see anything
that you had.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.767
-He's got texts here.
-Correct.

20:55.834 --> 20:58.299
-[Judy] So show me. Show me.
-I don't have anything to show you.

20:58.366 --> 20:59.633
My phone actually broke, so...

20:59.700 --> 21:03.900
You know how many people
in 26 years who have had broken phones?

21:03.967 --> 21:08.099
Always the ones who need--
who need... a phone.

21:08.165 --> 21:10.266
Who need evidence from a phone.

21:10.333 --> 21:13.066
Their phone fell in the toilet,
their phone fell in the river,

21:13.133 --> 21:16.599
fell in with their toupee in the bathtub.
Whatever.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.633
You owe him $725.
Judgment for the plaintiff.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.400
-We're finished here.
-[Kevin] Case is adjourned.

21:22.467 --> 21:23.467
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.633
It's fine. I'm glad the situation
is done and over with

21:26.700 --> 21:28.232
and I don't have to worry
about it anymore.

21:28.299 --> 21:30.567
Uh, just shows you unfortunately,
you have to be very wary

21:30.633 --> 21:32.599
of people who you loan money to.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.967
Because they'll take advantage
of your payments.

21:34.032 --> 21:34.933
He's mad we broke up.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.299
She'd tell me the check's in the mail,

21:36.366 --> 21:38.532
or she's gonna
Western Union me the money,

21:38.599 --> 21:40.366
so there was always the runaround.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.933
-Lesson learned.
-Judge Judy gave me justice. Thank you.

21:43.799 --> 21:46.099
That was one of those cases
I know you love.

21:46.165 --> 21:48.700
Where one of the litigants
at least comes prepared

21:48.767 --> 21:50.567
with their documents,
their evidence,

21:50.633 --> 21:52.599
texts, proof of a loan...

21:52.666 --> 21:54.700
-Organized.
-Ducks in a row.

21:54.767 --> 21:57.532
It makes the world go
so much more smoothly.

21:57.599 --> 22:00.532
So that's the takeaway from this case.
You go to court,

22:00.599 --> 22:02.400
don't say "I lost my phone."

22:02.467 --> 22:03.799
"The dog ate my homework."

22:03.866 --> 22:06.099
"I have nothing." Keep it simple.

22:06.165 --> 22:08.133
"I owe him the money."
And goodbye.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.866
-Yes.
-[Judy] Or just make an arrangement.

22:10.933 --> 22:13.099
It's so interesting to me,
actually, Sarah.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.333
There's no question she has her phone.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.299
There's no question
she had the same texts.

22:17.366 --> 22:18.900
Look through them,
be organized.

22:18.967 --> 22:22.767
Or be responsible.
And the responsible thing...

22:22.834 --> 22:27.366
It was over, but she had agreed
to pay him the money to fix her car.

22:27.432 --> 22:29.099
Mm-hmm.
And if you're doing the right thing,

22:29.165 --> 22:30.633
you don't have to lose a phone

22:30.700 --> 22:32.967
to not let a judge like yourself
go through it

22:33.032 --> 22:34.266
-to find the right evidence.
-Right.

22:36.532 --> 22:37.933
