WEBVTT

00:01.950 --> 00:03.250
[Malory] Now, then, Mr. Crane,

00:03.300 --> 00:07.000
tell us what the Archer
Agency can do for you.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.600
- Well, I...
- Excuse me.

00:08.650 --> 00:10.425
It's the Figgis Agency.

00:10.475 --> 00:12.925
Cyril, please!
Stop interrupting.

00:12.975 --> 00:15.775
Now, Mr. Crane,
how can we help you?

00:15.825 --> 00:19.675
Well, I'm afraid that someone,
or someones,

00:19.725 --> 00:22.600
is trying to sabotage my latest
picture, <i>Deadly Velvet.</i>

00:22.650 --> 00:24.100
[door opens, shoes scuffle]

00:24.150 --> 00:25.775
[chuckling] You mean
besides the critics?

00:25.825 --> 00:28.100
Huh? We're still in production.

00:28.150 --> 00:30.675
It's a joke.
Lighten up, Fritz Lang.

00:30.725 --> 00:31.825
[clears throat]

00:31.875 --> 00:34.150
And what makes you
suspect sabotage?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.275
Well, as Lana can confirm...

00:36.325 --> 00:38.625
Oh-ho-ho, so now it's "Lana"?

00:38.675 --> 00:41.850
Uh, Miss Kane, rather,
who, as you know,

00:41.900 --> 00:43.475
has recently begun working

00:43.525 --> 00:45.950
on the picture as a
technical advisor.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.700
There's already been
three accidents on-set

00:47.750 --> 00:49.325
which were pretty suspicious.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.325
A fire,
a camera crane collapsed...

00:51.375 --> 00:53.200
Narrowly missing
several crew members.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.200
And yesterday, there was
some kind of malfunction

00:55.250 --> 00:56.475
with a stuntman's airbag.

00:56.525 --> 00:59.000
That poor devil
may be paralyzed.

00:59.050 --> 01:01.350
Well,
it certainly sounds suspicious.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.050
But why come to us?
Why not the police?

01:04.099 --> 01:05.474
- I...
- I don't know, Cyril.

01:05.525 --> 01:08.025
Maybe he wanted to be
interrupted every five seconds.

01:08.075 --> 01:09.650
I don't, actually.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.325
And Ellis doesn't want
the police involved.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.150
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
So now it's "Ellis"?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.500
Yes, Archer.
It's Ellis. And Lana.

01:15.550 --> 01:17.150
He and I are on a
first-name basis,

01:17.200 --> 01:19.350
whereas you and
I are on a break!

01:19.400 --> 01:21.225
Yeah, how you holdin' up?

01:21.275 --> 01:23.375
- Pff.
- I'll take that as a "barely."

01:23.425 --> 01:24.900
Take it however you want.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.200
Already did, so...

01:26.250 --> 01:28.375
- Could we...
- Cyril, I swear to God...

01:28.425 --> 01:30.600
Malory!
Ellis wants to hire the agency

01:30.650 --> 01:31.950
to go undercover on the set.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.125
[gasps] Ooh.

01:33.175 --> 01:34.850
You could pose as
technical advisor.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.350
I already am.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.675
- Posing.
- The technical advisor.

01:38.725 --> 01:40.800
And if someone is trying
to sabotage the movie,

01:40.850 --> 01:43.575
- our job is to catch them.
- Discreetly.

01:43.625 --> 01:46.525
If the insurance company
pulls the bond or, God forbid,

01:46.575 --> 01:48.525
my investors back out,
I'll be ruined!

01:48.575 --> 01:51.725
Don't worry, Mr. Crane.
We won't let that happen.

01:51.775 --> 01:53.050
Put your faith in us.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.725
[groans] I'm afraid I must.

01:55.775 --> 01:57.400
We'll see you there
this afternoon.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.575
Ellis,
should we get back to the set?

02:00.825 --> 02:02.550
Meh?
Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.050
[sighs]

02:04.100 --> 02:07.775
- And, uh, how are you holding up?
- Pff.

02:07.825 --> 02:09.574
All right, listen up.

02:09.625 --> 02:13.225
As much as I hate,
hate, hate, hate...

02:13.275 --> 02:15.750
to do this, a movie set is huge,

02:15.800 --> 02:18.550
so we're going to need all of
you to go undercover, so...

02:18.600 --> 02:20.550
- Yay!
- Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

02:20.600 --> 02:24.300
[groans] So try to act
like professionals.

02:24.350 --> 02:27.100
Professional whats?
What do we have to do, more work?

02:27.150 --> 02:30.350
Well, I've tried to match the
various production departments

02:30.400 --> 02:33.550
to your skill sets,
such as they are,

02:33.600 --> 02:36.250
so Cyril... accounting.
Get into those books.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.900
Find out who could
benefit from cost overruns

02:37.950 --> 02:39.750
or delays in production.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.575
And that is exactly what I was
going to tell myself to do, so...

02:42.625 --> 02:43.975
Pam... craft services.

02:44.025 --> 02:45.275
Goddamn it.

02:45.325 --> 02:47.475
Wh...
I'm the one who knows macramé.

02:47.525 --> 02:49.950
And you're also
babysitting Carol.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.150
Wh...
Why do I need a babysitter?

02:52.200 --> 02:53.950
Because they've
already had one fire.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.150
[sighs] Then why not
just leave her here?

02:56.200 --> 02:57.625
Because we've
already had one fire.

02:57.675 --> 02:59.300
Now, then, Gillette...

02:59.350 --> 03:00.600
Hair and makeup, hair and makeup,
hair and makeup,

03:00.650 --> 03:01.825
hair and makeup,
hair and makeup!

03:01.875 --> 03:03.000
Finished?

03:03.050 --> 03:04.600
Yes. Grip.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.925
Goddamn it!

03:05.975 --> 03:07.425
Ooh, what about me?
What about me?

03:07.475 --> 03:10.600
Oh,
you just sort of skulk around.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.275
Oh, I will.

03:12.325 --> 03:15.450
And I shall pose as
an executive producer,

03:15.500 --> 03:17.325
which leaves Sterling.

03:17.375 --> 03:20.325
Yeah, it leaves him right here
'cause I'll be damned

03:20.375 --> 03:23.175
if I'm helping Lana's new
pretend boyfriend make a movie.

03:23.225 --> 03:26.125
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah, well...

03:26.175 --> 03:28.025
Krieger,
I suppose you'll just have to be

03:28.075 --> 03:29.800
Veronica Deane's new bodyguard.

03:29.850 --> 03:32.625
- [gasps]
- [car horn blowing]

03:32.675 --> 03:33.850
Let's go, you dumb idiots.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.325
Well, one of you, anyway.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.375
The rest of you,
I guess maybe carpool.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.625
Luigi won't let anybody
ride in the cab.

03:39.675 --> 03:41.875
I mean,
unless you're down for road head.

Yep. Just one of the many

What's a C.D.L.?

04:43.625 --> 04:45.600
Commercial driver's license.

And also a [bleep].

04:48.825 --> 04:50.775
Ugh! You are so gross.

04:50.825 --> 04:52.550
[chuckling] That's what he said.

But in Italian.

Who said what in Italian?

04:55.600 --> 04:56.750
Don't ask. You'll gag.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.050
I thought maybe you
dopes had stumbled

04:59.100 --> 05:01.125
onto some sort of
mafia shakedown.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.725
We've been here,
like, four minutes.

05:02.775 --> 05:04.725
Well?
Anything suspicious so far?

05:04.775 --> 05:06.125
Uh, just you?

05:06.175 --> 05:09.100
What, I'm a flamboyant
Hollywood producer.

05:09.150 --> 05:10.400
Not the world's
tiniest drag queen?

05:10.450 --> 05:11.725
What?

05:11.775 --> 05:13.400
I said we'll keep you updated.

Holy shit,
did she just eat a grape?

05:19.075 --> 05:20.325
Must be her cheat day.

05:21.775 --> 05:23.400
[Archer] Man,
it really looks like the '40s.

05:23.450 --> 05:24.900
This is weird, right?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.075
Like the time <i>Star
Trek</i> went to Chicago.

05:27.125 --> 05:30.075
Or Nazi Germany,
for whatever idiot reason.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.250
Archer?

05:31.300 --> 05:33.325
Shapiro?
What are you doing here?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.475
Protecting my client

05:34.525 --> 05:36.625
with my colleagues,
Smith & Wesson.

05:36.675 --> 05:39.175
Oh, really, 'cause I'd
like to meet those guys.

05:39.225 --> 05:40.325
Come on, stop.

05:40.375 --> 05:41.925
First of all,
not a Smith & Wesson.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.000
I know,
but I was going for the whole...

05:44.050 --> 05:46.425
- Second of all, this.
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:46.475 --> 05:47.725
[gun clatters]

05:49.225 --> 05:50.425
Goddamn it.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.425
What the hell, man?
I needed that.

05:52.475 --> 05:53.625
No, you didn't.

05:53.675 --> 05:55.950
Yes, I did.
This set is dangerous.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.800
As dangerous as
you with a firearm?

05:57.850 --> 05:59.275
Are you kid...

05:59.325 --> 06:00.500
Shit's catching on fire.

06:00.550 --> 06:02.000
Shit's falling on people.

06:02.050 --> 06:04.950
People are falling on shit.
Like the ground.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.175
Well, I think it's all just
a big dumb coincidence,

06:07.225 --> 06:10.000
but even if it's not,
don't worry about... [gasps]

06:11.825 --> 06:12.875
Veronica Deane.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.850
Yes? Oh, hello, Alan.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.800
Wait. That's why you're here?

06:17.850 --> 06:19.350
Yeah, Crane hired us.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.525
It's nice to see you again,
Ms. Deane.

06:21.575 --> 06:22.975
I'm sorry. Have we met?

06:23.025 --> 06:24.525
Oh, um, yeah.

06:24.575 --> 06:26.675
I'm Sterling Archer,
private investigator.

06:26.725 --> 06:28.800
You hired me.

06:28.850 --> 06:30.200
Um, and then another time,

06:30.250 --> 06:32.150
I protected you in
a hostage situation,

06:32.200 --> 06:33.550
dressed as a clown.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.550
- Is this not ringing any...
- Alan?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.875
Apparently Ellis hired him to
protect you during the shoot.

06:38.925 --> 06:42.325
Other than my ex-husband's refusal
to let me get on with my life,

06:42.375 --> 06:45.600
the only thing I need protection
from is this clunky dialogue.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.850
Thought I had a joke, but...

06:48.900 --> 06:51.000
Mr... Archer, was it?

06:51.050 --> 06:53.400
Yeah. We actually even kissed.

06:53.450 --> 06:56.025
I'm sorry you've wasted your
time, but I can assure you

06:56.075 --> 06:57.825
I have absolutely no need
for a bodyguard, so...

06:57.875 --> 06:58.875
- [man] Look out!
- [gasps]

07:05.225 --> 07:08.575

07:08.625 --> 07:10.375

07:13.225 --> 07:14.800
[chuckling] Yeah, you were.

07:23.550 --> 07:26.225
[man] Move those cans. Now!

07:26.275 --> 07:28.800
Don't you break my cables!
Come on, people!

07:28.850 --> 07:31.000
Move the cables! Careful!

07:31.050 --> 07:32.975
Oh, for God's sakes, what now?

07:33.025 --> 07:35.100
Looks like a runaway forklift.

07:35.150 --> 07:39.100
[groaning] That, and I'm pretty
sure my ribs are shattered.

07:39.150 --> 07:42.000
- Like breadsticks.
- Move those lights, you fools!

07:42.050 --> 07:45.150
Oh,
we're just hemorrhaging money.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.325
- And speaking of hemorrhaging...
- What in the hell happened?

07:48.375 --> 07:50.975
- A forklift.
- And a forkwad.

07:51.025 --> 07:52.775
What's the big idea,
kicking my guts out?

07:52.825 --> 07:55.625
When, just now?
When I saved your life?

07:55.675 --> 07:57.800
- And mine.
- Oh, now...

07:57.850 --> 07:59.625
Oh, please.

07:59.675 --> 08:01.025
What's her problem?

08:01.075 --> 08:02.300
How much time do you have?

08:02.350 --> 08:04.325
[Carol] What is wrong with you?!

08:04.375 --> 08:07.800
[grunting] What's wrong with you,
lady?

08:07.850 --> 08:09.300
You killed it.

08:09.350 --> 08:12.475
It was beautiful,
and you blew it out!

08:12.525 --> 08:15.150
[screams] You maniacs!

08:15.200 --> 08:17.475
You blew it out! Damn you!

08:17.525 --> 08:19.725
Goddamn you all to hell!

08:19.775 --> 08:21.350
What the hell, Tunt?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.150
You leave me to craft all
the service by myself?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.550
I smelled fire.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.700
You mean smoke.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.000
Uh, no.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.025
Oh, I can't believe this.

08:30.075 --> 08:32.650
Yes, it would appear your
"phantom" has struck agai...

08:32.700 --> 08:34.025
Shh-shh-shh-shh...

08:34.075 --> 08:36.500
Back to work, you...
you goldbricks.

08:36.549 --> 08:39.000
All right, you heard the man.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

08:39.049 --> 08:40.700
[people chattering]

08:40.750 --> 08:42.850
That's exactly the sort of rumor

08:42.900 --> 08:44.350
I don't want you
spreading around.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.050
Maybe this was just an accident.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.200
Nah, somebody definitely
tampered with it.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.250
The brake line's cut,
the steering wheel's tied off,

08:51.300 --> 08:53.250
and the throttle linkage
is jammed wide open.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.575
Yeah, I was gonna say...

08:54.625 --> 08:55.750
linkage jam.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.350
Says the man who pays

08:57.400 --> 08:59.550
to have his Ferrari trucked
around on a flatbed.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.600
And how much is
that costing you?

09:01.650 --> 09:03.525
Actually, not much more
than just driving it,

09:03.575 --> 09:04.900
when you factor in
all the repairs.

09:04.950 --> 09:06.050
Plus no DUIs.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.350
[chuckling] Well, fewer.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.700
And shut up.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.375
You wanna try and make me? Huh?

09:10.425 --> 09:13.200
Now, listen here, you...
you rounder.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.925
You keep a civil tone
here with Ms. Kane,

09:14.975 --> 09:17.050
or I'll throw you off
this set so fast you'll...

09:17.100 --> 09:19.200
you'll pass yourself going.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.875
- Wait, what?
- You'll do nothing of the sort.

09:20.925 --> 09:22.700
Archer is my bodyguard,

09:22.750 --> 09:25.375
and if he goes, you can find
yourself another female lead.

09:25.425 --> 09:27.950
And on the off chance you
plan to shoot anything today,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.275
I'll be in my dressing room!

09:30.325 --> 09:32.425
Archer? Shall we?

09:32.475 --> 09:34.400
[chuckling] Yes,
we probably shall.

09:34.450 --> 09:35.725
Damn it.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.725
Yeah, well Ellis and I will
be in his dressing room, so...

09:38.775 --> 09:40.300
shall we?

09:40.350 --> 09:42.800
Actually, my dear, I need
to go meet with my investors

09:42.850 --> 09:44.925
to cushion the blow about this,

09:44.975 --> 09:47.975
as it were, so... hmm.

09:48.025 --> 09:49.575
So, apparently, you shan't.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.575
Oh, my God, jealous much?

09:51.625 --> 09:54.075
[laughs] Jealous.

09:54.125 --> 09:57.325
It's getting hard to tell the
kettles from the pots around here.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.775
Well, usually,
kettles have whistles.

09:59.825 --> 10:01.075
If that helps.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.325
[sighs]

10:02.375 --> 10:04.450
Hey, Malory,
do you have a minute?

10:04.500 --> 10:07.450
"Malory"?
What happened to "Ms. Archer"?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.925
Well, technically,
they both work for me, so...

10:09.975 --> 10:13.825
So you thought today would be a good
day to try on your big-boy britches

10:13.875 --> 10:15.925
right in the middle
of a mystery?

10:15.975 --> 10:17.100
That's my point.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.775
I think I may have found a clue.

10:18.825 --> 10:20.325
Well, all right, Cyril.

10:20.375 --> 10:24.175
But you'd better just wind
in that neck, Mr. Man.

10:24.225 --> 10:25.800
So, Archer...

10:25.850 --> 10:27.775
would you say women,
on the whole,

10:27.825 --> 10:29.475
found him attractive?

10:29.525 --> 10:31.150
[chuckles] Which hole?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.625
Because yes.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.275
Albeit grudgingly.

10:34.325 --> 10:36.775
[sighs] And sexually,
would you say...

10:36.825 --> 10:39.450
[laughing] Which hole?

10:39.500 --> 10:40.950
[clears throat] Sorry. What?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.825
And would you say he's...
accomplished?

10:43.875 --> 10:45.325
Like, is he good at plowing?

10:45.375 --> 10:46.950
You know he's straight, right?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.975
- I'm...
- Aww, Li'l Baby Elton...

10:49.025 --> 10:50.475
I'm straight.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.375
[gasps] Okay, hypothetically...

10:52.425 --> 10:55.850
No, not... Wait...
Look, I'm in love with Veronica.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.050
I have been since the first
time I laid eyes on her.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.700
I'll never forget that moment.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.650
It felt like I got kicked
in the chest by a mule.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.975
Yeah, you don't forget
a hoof to the tits.

11:05.025 --> 11:06.475
Or shooting your first mule.

11:06.525 --> 11:08.475
Wh...
[sighs] How many have you shot?

11:08.525 --> 11:10.025
Hmm... two.

11:10.075 --> 11:11.975
Anyway,
since she and Crane divorced,

11:12.025 --> 11:13.400
I thought I might have a chance.

11:13.450 --> 11:15.025
[laughs]

11:15.075 --> 11:16.850
But now I'm worried she
might fall for Archer.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.400
If she hasn't already.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.025
Which...

11:20.075 --> 11:21.500
I just need a moment to change

11:21.550 --> 11:23.675
into something more comfortable.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.725
But, please,
do make yourself at home.

11:25.775 --> 11:27.700
<i>Faites comme chez vouz,
</i> as the French say.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.500
Please, take your time.

11:29.550 --> 11:32.000
Oh, and there should be a
bottle of champagne chilling.

11:32.050 --> 11:34.500
- [bottle pops]
- ♪♪ [soft jazz]

11:34.550 --> 11:37.175
So there is.

11:37.225 --> 11:39.425
So you want us to
quit doing our jobs

11:39.475 --> 11:41.025
to help you cockblock Archer?

11:41.075 --> 11:44.375
Well, I... Wait.
Was that sarcastic, or...

11:44.425 --> 11:47.250
- No.
- Then, yeah, I'd love that.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.400
Really?

11:48.450 --> 11:51.100
Enough to shoot a mule?

11:51.150 --> 11:53.100
I mean, not that I think
it'll come to that.

11:53.150 --> 11:54.525
[Malory] You lost me.

11:54.575 --> 11:56.425
[Cyril] Which I think
is the whole point here.

11:56.475 --> 11:58.200
I mean,
in all my years of accounting,

11:58.250 --> 11:59.425
I've never seen
anything like it.

11:59.475 --> 12:02.025
And I've seen some
pretty crazy stuff.

12:02.075 --> 12:04.200
Treating deferred revenue
as earned revenue,

12:04.250 --> 12:06.550
lapping, force balancing, uh...

12:06.600 --> 12:08.450
All right, Cyril, I get it.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.250
Yours is a world of
mystery and adventure.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.550
But pretend I'm not HAL 9000.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.075
Okay, the best I can tell,
basically,

12:15.125 --> 12:16.725
the investors on this movie

12:16.775 --> 12:18.950
will make more money if
production shuts down.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.800
From the production insurance?

12:20.850 --> 12:23.100
It's insured for triple what they
could hope to make at the box office.

12:23.150 --> 12:26.900
But Crane was going on and on about
not wanting to lose the insurance...

12:26.950 --> 12:28.625
Yeah, that's the proverbial rub.

12:28.675 --> 12:30.775
The insurance bond
is actually reinsured

12:30.825 --> 12:32.775
by a shell corporation
in Florida,

12:32.825 --> 12:36.075
whose policy is reinsured by
a shell corporation in Panama,

12:36.125 --> 12:38.400
and so on and so
on down the line

12:38.450 --> 12:40.600
until... well,
I lost the trail in Liberia.

12:40.650 --> 12:42.950
Pff. The Cousin
Oliver of Africa.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.750
But the name of the
Florida shell company is...

12:45.800 --> 12:48.450
wait for it... Sandhill-Crane.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.750
So? Some panhandle trash-bird?

12:50.800 --> 12:54.000
[sighs] Not that kind of crane.
Ellis Crane.

12:54.050 --> 12:55.425
I think he's behind this company

12:55.475 --> 12:57.425
and all these so-called
"accidents."

12:57.475 --> 13:01.325
Which means he would stand to
benefit if production were shut down.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.425
He'd make millions.

13:03.475 --> 13:05.850
Pretty impressive detective work,
if I do say so myself.

13:07.650 --> 13:10.275
And apparently I'm the only
one who's gonna say it, so...

13:10.325 --> 13:11.975
Oh, get over yourself, Rain Man.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.600
Sandhill-Crane could
just be a coincidence.

13:14.650 --> 13:16.150
It's not enough
to prove anything.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.275
No, we need to catch
Crane in the act somehow.

13:19.325 --> 13:21.275
Maybe if we used
someone as bait.

13:21.325 --> 13:23.150
Yeah, I don't know.
How would that even...

13:23.200 --> 13:24.825
Where's Gillette?

13:24.875 --> 13:26.650
Yeah, see?
When we feather it out like that,

13:26.700 --> 13:28.125
it really frames your face.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.200
And I mean,
with your cheekbones...

13:30.250 --> 13:31.300
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

13:31.350 --> 13:34.050
What the hell are you doing?

13:35.725 --> 13:37.175
Gripping?

13:45.475 --> 13:46.600
[Malory] All right, Cyril.

13:46.650 --> 13:50.050
So if Crane really is
behind all these accidents,

13:50.100 --> 13:53.525
the question is how
do we catch him?

13:53.575 --> 13:55.175
Oh, you're asking me. Sorry.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.750
I thought that was rhetorical.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.425
Why would I be asking
rhetorical questions?

13:59.475 --> 14:01.700
- Bec...
- That one was.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.100
All right,
so what's the plan, guys?

14:03.150 --> 14:05.250
How do we stop Archer from
hooking up with Veronica?

14:05.300 --> 14:06.700
Umm...

14:06.750 --> 14:08.375
Ooh!
We could throw acid in her face.

14:08.425 --> 14:09.875
Wh... Jesus.

14:09.925 --> 14:11.525
What is wrong with you?

14:11.575 --> 14:14.075
What? Then you swoop in
and take care of her,

14:14.125 --> 14:16.050
and then slowly,
after many years,

14:16.100 --> 14:19.575
she might fall in some weird
semblance of love with you.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.075
Yeah,
I think maybe we can do better.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.775
Okay, but the perfect is
the enemy of the good.

14:24.825 --> 14:25.925
Mm.

14:25.975 --> 14:28.075
Ooh. How about I seduce her?

14:28.125 --> 14:30.775
Yeah,
I don't think she's bisexual.

14:30.825 --> 14:32.550
[scoffs] Who cares?

14:32.600 --> 14:34.750
Plus,
I bet she'd prefer the acid.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.800
Hey, you know what?

14:35.850 --> 14:37.600
What are you ninnies doing?

14:37.650 --> 14:39.600
- Looking for acid.
- [together] No, we're not.

14:39.650 --> 14:43.225
This is no time to be taking your
damn drugs, you hippie dropouts.

14:43.275 --> 14:47.400
We think Ellis Crane might be the
one who's sabotaging the production.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.075
Holy shit-snacks.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.400
- Who's Ellis Crane?
- I knew it.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.600
I mean, I didn't know it.
I had no idea whatsoever.

14:53.650 --> 14:56.075
But now that you say it,
it makes total sense.

14:56.125 --> 14:57.450
But what makes you
think it's Crane?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.075
- Well, I...
- Doesn't matter.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.150
Or it won't,
once we can catch him red-handed,

15:01.200 --> 15:03.425
which is what we're
hatching a plan to do.

15:03.475 --> 15:05.125
Ooh. How about I seduce him?

15:05.175 --> 15:08.725
[sighs] Pam,
I doubt the man is bisexual.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.100
[scoffs] Who care... Wait, what?

15:11.150 --> 15:13.500
And even if he were,
he wouldn't want a blob like you.

15:13.550 --> 15:16.925
I mean, when was the last
time you even saw your penis?

15:16.975 --> 15:18.325
I...

15:20.225 --> 15:22.175
She knows you're a woman, right?

15:22.225 --> 15:23.425
I thought she did.

15:23.475 --> 15:25.000
Wait. You had sex with her.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.500
Yeah,
but she was all tore-up drunk.

15:27.550 --> 15:29.800
Oh, right.
Plus I was wearing a stra...

15:29.850 --> 15:31.450
- Eww!
- What?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.825
Don't ask. You'll gag.

15:32.875 --> 15:33.950
[chuckling] She certainly did.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.175
Who did what?

15:35.225 --> 15:36.625
Seriously, don't ask.

15:36.675 --> 15:38.175
But let me ask you this.

15:38.225 --> 15:40.625
Do you think there's
anything about Archer

15:40.675 --> 15:43.500
that women would
find to be a turnoff?

15:43.550 --> 15:45.950
[laughs] Oh, you're serious.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.800
Well, then, shit.
Where to begin? Umm...

15:48.850 --> 15:51.825
And there is a bit of
a clock on this, so...

15:51.875 --> 15:54.200
- Why?
- Well, he and Veronica

15:54.250 --> 15:56.625
have been in her dressing
room for a while now.

15:56.675 --> 15:57.675
Uh-huh.

15:57.725 --> 16:01.150
And since apparently Archer's
penis is like a crack pipe...

16:01.200 --> 16:02.700
What, in size and/or shape?

16:02.750 --> 16:06.550
They said if he has sex with Veronica,
she'll fall head over heels for him.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.875
Oh, they did, did they?

16:08.925 --> 16:10.350
Yes.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.200
[exhales] Did you, um...

16:14.250 --> 16:15.550
Mm-hmm.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.725
Hm. Me too.

16:17.775 --> 16:19.400
[chuckling] Yes, I know.

16:19.450 --> 16:20.825
Oh, right.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.500
Sorry about the, uh...

16:22.550 --> 16:25.175
- I think it'll come out.
- Phrasing. Still, though.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.325
But as much as I'd love
to lie here and bask

16:27.375 --> 16:28.900
in this post-coital glow...

16:28.950 --> 16:30.750
Right? We've got champagne.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.575
We're over the worst
of the stickiness.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.850
I know,
but it's very nearly 3:00.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.375
Really? That late?

16:36.425 --> 16:38.250
Yes, almost exactly 3:00,

16:38.300 --> 16:41.425
and I'm late for a
wardrobe fitting, so...

16:41.475 --> 16:43.850
So I'll just wait for you here,
or...

16:43.900 --> 16:45.350
Um, sure.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.750
I'm sorry I have to run,

16:46.800 --> 16:48.750
but it's almost
the stroke of 3:00.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.550
Yeah, you mentioned...

16:50.600 --> 16:53.050
Mm, mwah. Back soon.

16:53.100 --> 16:57.375
- And I'll be here, slowly drying.
- [door opens, closes]

16:57.425 --> 16:58.700
Ahh...

16:58.750 --> 17:00.700
Oh, man, I can't believe

17:00.750 --> 17:02.700
I just made love
to Veronica Deane.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.875
I wonder if this is how
Tenzing Norgay felt.

17:05.925 --> 17:10.099
Holy shit, I wonder if this is
how Tenzing Norgay always feels.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.875
[Lana] What, sticky?

17:11.925 --> 17:13.125
Gulp.

17:13.175 --> 17:16.125
You know,
we could just confront Crane

17:16.175 --> 17:18.375
- with the evidence.
- The flimsy evidence.

17:18.425 --> 17:20.625
Yeah, but maybe his reaction
would give him away.

17:20.675 --> 17:22.599
Hmm.

17:22.650 --> 17:26.550
All right. So we just barge
into his dressing room and...

17:26.599 --> 17:27.950
ambush him!

17:28.000 --> 17:30.100
Because you said
we were on a break!

17:30.150 --> 17:32.550
So two days later,
your cock's wet?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.925
Oh, I'm sorry, Lana,
is there a grace period?

17:34.975 --> 17:37.000
- If there is, you neglected to tell me.
- There's an acceptable amount of time

17:37.050 --> 17:39.825
before you start cramming
your trash dick...

17:39.875 --> 17:42.400
You never bother to
consult me on anything.

17:42.450 --> 17:45.575
And for your information,
this stupid break wasn't my idea.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.075
It was yours!

17:47.125 --> 17:50.150
Because you,
prolapsed rectum that you are,

17:50.200 --> 17:52.650
are infatuated with
Veronica Deane,

17:52.700 --> 17:56.500
whose cobwebby old snooch, by
the way, I can smell from here.

17:56.550 --> 17:59.425
[chuckles] Well,
it's not cobwebby anymore.

17:59.475 --> 18:01.425
[growls]

18:01.475 --> 18:02.975
[grunting, thudding]

18:03.025 --> 18:04.125
- Lana!
- [Lana yelling]

18:04.175 --> 18:06.175
So that's your plan.

18:06.225 --> 18:08.425
- Yeah.
- In its entirety.

18:08.475 --> 18:09.775
Yep.

18:09.825 --> 18:11.775
We just slam the
door open and say...

18:11.825 --> 18:13.100
Don't do it!

18:13.150 --> 18:14.600
He's riddled with clap!

18:14.650 --> 18:15.775
[Archer] What?

18:15.825 --> 18:17.300
Um...

18:17.350 --> 18:18.775
[both panting]

18:18.825 --> 18:19.825
[together] What?

18:19.875 --> 18:21.775
I, um...

18:21.825 --> 18:23.325
Man, you ever do that...

18:23.375 --> 18:26.150
you walk in a room
and you forget why?

18:26.200 --> 18:28.325
- [together] No.
- And what are you looking at?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.850
Wow. It is kind of
like a crack pipe.

18:30.900 --> 18:34.825
Will you idiots please leave so I
can beat this man's ass in private?

18:34.875 --> 18:36.800
Oh, whatever.
I was beating your...

18:36.850 --> 18:37.975
- [woman screams]
- [gasp]

18:38.025 --> 18:40.525
Mother! Move, idiots!

18:40.575 --> 18:43.125
- [Shapiro] Out of my way.
- [Pam] Follow that ass.

18:43.175 --> 18:45.350
Mother!
Mother, are you all right?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.500
Why wouldn't I be?

18:46.550 --> 18:48.050
I... I heard you scream.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.000
That wasn't me. It was this one.

18:50.050 --> 18:52.225
Well, it was very upsetting.

18:52.275 --> 18:54.150
- [Shapiro] Whoa.
- [Pam] Oh, my God.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.475
[Archer] Oh.
Yeah, that is pretty upsetting.

18:56.525 --> 18:59.025
And what the hell
are you wearing?

18:59.075 --> 19:02.500
I think technically
it's a loincloth?

19:02.550 --> 19:05.025
Fashioned out of a
baby-doll nightie.

19:05.075 --> 19:06.325
[sighs]

19:06.375 --> 19:07.900
Well, I'm sorry, Mother.

19:07.950 --> 19:10.325
I didn't know I'd be
going to a funeral.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.925
I would've worn a black one.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.500
[Dietrich] Okay,
people, uh, listen up.

19:23.550 --> 19:26.025
This is now an active
homicide investigation,

19:26.075 --> 19:28.925
and while the situation on the
ground may be somewhat fluid...

19:28.975 --> 19:31.725
[chuckling] Fluid on the ground,
on the walls...

19:31.775 --> 19:33.525
You shut up!

19:33.575 --> 19:36.525
Shut your mouth, or I swear
to Christ in His heaven

19:36.575 --> 19:39.225
I will personally frame
you for this murder!

19:39.275 --> 19:40.700
Hey, bub, remember?

19:40.750 --> 19:42.600
About the thing?

19:42.650 --> 19:45.225
[clears throat] Please
disregard my previous statement.

19:45.275 --> 19:47.575
Merely an ill-advised
attempt at levity.

19:47.625 --> 19:50.575
Okay. And in light of
your various professional,

19:50.625 --> 19:53.700
or, in some cases, personal
relationships with the victim,

19:53.750 --> 19:56.775
at the present time,
you are all persons of interest.

19:56.825 --> 19:57.900
[overlapping chattering]

19:57.950 --> 19:59.875
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

19:59.925 --> 20:03.575
He didn't say "suspects". Yet.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.875
But until we do
have a suspect...

20:05.925 --> 20:07.550
Or suspects.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.225
We are gonna have to ask you

20:09.275 --> 20:10.800
not to leave town
without checking with us.

20:10.850 --> 20:12.550
But that's ridiculous.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.625
It wasn't any of us.
He hired us for protection.

20:15.675 --> 20:17.425
What, like a protection racket?

20:17.475 --> 20:18.925
No, you...

20:18.975 --> 20:20.400
We think Crane was caught up

20:20.450 --> 20:21.900
in some sort of insurance fraud,

20:21.950 --> 20:24.075
all the way from
here to Liberia.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.075
Okay, okay. And we're gonna
be looking into all that,

20:26.125 --> 20:28.075
- but in the meantime...
- We've all got alibis.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.475
Then you've got
nothing to worry about.

20:29.525 --> 20:31.075
Yeah,
because they'll be easy to check.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.450
We've got an exact
time of death.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.425
But a time-of-death estimate

20:34.475 --> 20:37.325
is only exact to within
maybe one hour, so...

20:37.375 --> 20:38.825
Try one second, gnome-nuts.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.425
[overlapping muttering]

20:40.475 --> 20:42.300
The victim had a
defensive wound.

20:42.350 --> 20:44.250
Bullet went right
through his Rolex.

20:44.300 --> 20:48.125
[imitates gunshot] Exact
time of death, 2:14 p.m.

20:48.175 --> 20:50.000
[overlapping chattering]

20:50.050 --> 20:51.775
Well, my goodness,
what a relief.

20:51.825 --> 20:53.125
No, I just mean...

20:53.175 --> 20:56.100
Well, you know, the ex-wife,
a bitter divorce.

20:56.150 --> 20:58.100
I'm sure I would've
been the prime suspect.

20:58.150 --> 20:59.800
But I couldn't have
murdered Ellis.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.975
I was with you, Archer.

21:02.025 --> 21:03.600
Remember?

21:03.650 --> 21:05.875
Until almost the stroke of 3:00.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.000
Um...
