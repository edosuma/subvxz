WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:07.434
Nope. Nope.

00:07.450 --> 00:08.517
- Huh?
- N... Nope. Nope.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.818
No. No. No.

00:11.855 --> 00:14.456
Kids, just came in to remind
you to keep Saturday open.

00:14.491 --> 00:16.254
What's Saturday?

00:16.479 --> 00:18.571
What's Saturday? It's
your mother's birthday.

00:18.587 --> 00:21.679
No... her birthday is
the second weekend in May.

00:21.704 --> 00:23.958
That's mother's day, honey.

00:23.992 --> 00:25.626
- I don't think so.
- I just don't think that

00:25.660 --> 00:27.962
this is the year to be doing something big.

00:27.996 --> 00:30.528
Oh, why? Because we're here, in this town?

00:30.553 --> 00:33.100
All the more reason to do something.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.669
Um... I actually agree with David.

00:35.704 --> 00:38.405
Um... plus, I'm gonna be
in Chicago this weekend.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.040
- You're what?
- Ted's taking me.

00:40.075 --> 00:42.309
We've been planning this
for a super long time, so.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.645
Well, can I come?

00:44.679 --> 00:46.679
- No.
- Okay, here's a newsflash

00:46.714 --> 00:48.681
for both of you. You're not going anywhere

00:48.716 --> 00:51.184
and we're planning a surprise
party for your mother.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.121
No. That's not... That's not a good idea.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.955
That's not a good idea?

00:55.990 --> 00:58.325
Where would you even throw a
party like that in this town?

00:58.359 --> 00:59.926
I don't know. I haven't
thought that through yet.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.263
Maybe Roland's house.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.393
Listen to the words
coming out of your mouth.

01:05.418 --> 01:06.604
Then you plan it.

01:06.629 --> 01:09.101
- What? No!
- Oh, snap, David!

01:09.136 --> 01:13.439
Talk to the hand, son, because
the ears are no longer working.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.299
- Oh my God.
- 'Kay, that's not at all how that works, so...

01:15.324 --> 01:16.475
Cancel your trip, Alexis,

01:16.510 --> 01:20.646
because the travel agent
is out of the office.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.714
It's so uncomfortable when
he does stuff like that.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.242
- No. Absolutely not.
- I feel so weird about it.

01:25.267 --> 01:30.689
- Synced the_foe for his Misia :)

01:31.757 --> 01:34.225
And on Saturday, we have the afternoon off,

01:34.260 --> 01:39.132
so I booked us... a Chicago's
best deep dish pizza tour.

01:39.157 --> 01:40.798
Oh my God.

01:40.832 --> 01:42.781
Well, that's probably gonna have to change,

01:42.806 --> 01:45.048
but what else did you book for us?

01:45.073 --> 01:49.437
Uh, well, we're staying at the Clarendon
Executive Suites and apartments downtown.

01:49.462 --> 01:51.148
- Oh my God.
- Got upgraded.

01:51.173 --> 01:52.130
Does that mean room service?!

01:52.164 --> 01:53.897
- Yeah.
- Babe!

01:53.932 --> 01:55.202
- Hi!
- Hey.

01:55.227 --> 01:58.699
Had an idea for mom's
stupid surprise party thing.

01:58.724 --> 02:01.572
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- What if we told her that it was a fund-raiser?

02:01.607 --> 02:03.327
- She'd have to say yes, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:03.352 --> 02:06.187
- 'Cause she'd have to come then, right?
- Totally, totally, yeah.

02:06.212 --> 02:07.749
- She loves the fundraisers and...
- She loves them.

02:07.774 --> 02:09.880
Wait. When's the big party?

02:09.913 --> 02:11.749
Oh, it's this... Saturday.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.265
Alexis, did you not tell Ted
about your change of plans?

02:14.290 --> 02:16.220
David, I told you that I couldn't come...

02:16.254 --> 02:17.530
- It's this Saturday?
- To that.

02:17.555 --> 02:20.225
Yeah. But, David, I did tell you that I...

02:20.259 --> 02:21.926
Won't be able to attend, so...

02:21.961 --> 02:24.229
Well, Lex, I mean...

02:24.263 --> 02:26.765
You can't miss your own
mother's surprise party.

02:26.799 --> 02:28.599
I am with... I'm with Ted on this one.

02:28.634 --> 02:30.668
But, babe, you're going to...

02:30.702 --> 02:32.871
A veterinary conference in a Chicago suburb

02:32.905 --> 02:35.606
and I think that's... that's
really important for us.

02:35.641 --> 02:37.341
Yeah, I know. Here's just
the thing about our mom:

02:37.376 --> 02:39.510
She'll be really devastated
if Alexis doesn't come,

02:39.544 --> 02:41.479
and I'm sure you're from
a really solid home and...

02:41.513 --> 02:42.846
- David...
- Understand.

02:42.881 --> 02:44.181
I'm gonna slap you in the face.

02:44.215 --> 02:46.751
Um... but babe, what about the um...

02:46.785 --> 02:49.720
The travelling pizza tour that was so...

02:49.755 --> 02:52.456
yeah, and I'm also gonna need
you to ask Mutt for the barn

02:52.491 --> 02:54.802
'cause I'm thinking of heading in that
sort of aesthetic direction for the party.

02:54.827 --> 02:57.661
Um, and I know that you guys have
a close working relationship, so...

02:57.695 --> 02:59.059
No. No.

02:59.084 --> 03:02.020
Sweetie, there will be other conferences.

03:02.036 --> 03:03.995
I really think that you
need to be here for this.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.604
Me too.

03:05.639 --> 03:10.240
David, you and mom literally ruin my life.

03:13.946 --> 03:16.214
Roland!

03:16.249 --> 03:18.941
Hey! Johnny Rose!

03:18.966 --> 03:19.918
How are you?

03:19.952 --> 03:21.386
- I'm good!
- Good.

03:21.421 --> 03:23.321
- Listen. Need a big favour.
- Sure.

03:23.356 --> 03:25.713
Saturday is Moira's birthday

03:25.738 --> 03:27.526
and we want to throw her a surprise party.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.528
- Oh!
- So, we need an excuse to get

03:29.562 --> 03:31.729
her all dressed up and out of the house.

03:31.764 --> 03:34.065
Well, dinner at our place. Problem solved.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.081
Well... tempting,

03:36.116 --> 03:38.350
but it's gotta be something
fancy and, uh, elegant.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.720
You know, black tie.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.889
So we're thinking maybe Jocelyn is throwing

03:42.923 --> 03:46.759
her "annual charity fundraiser."

03:46.794 --> 03:48.494
She hasn't mentioned
anything to me about it.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.162
Why would she mention it?

03:50.196 --> 03:52.131
Well, Johnny, uh...

03:52.165 --> 03:54.699
If she's planning a fundraiser,

03:54.734 --> 03:59.004
I think Jocelyn would mention
something about it to her husband.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.307
It's not a real fundraiser, Roland.

04:01.341 --> 04:05.110
It's just a pretend fundraiser
to get Moira out of the house.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.579
You see, I... I could
tell her about it myself,

04:07.613 --> 04:11.149
but she would catch on because it
falls on the same night as her birthday,

04:11.183 --> 04:13.117
so she's gotta hear about the fundraiser

04:13.152 --> 04:16.553
from someone who doesn't
know it's her birthday.

04:16.588 --> 04:20.425
Okay, so then you want me to
find somebody who doesn't know.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.161
No. I want you to tell her.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.728
But that doesn't make any sense.

04:24.763 --> 04:26.965
I know it's her birthday.

04:26.999 --> 04:29.434
You only know it's her birthday because
I just told you it's her birthday.

04:29.468 --> 04:32.069
Moira doesn't know you
know it's her birthday.

04:32.103 --> 04:33.637
- Roland I won't tell her.
- Why would you tell her?

04:33.672 --> 04:35.272
I won't tell her is what I'm saying to you.

04:35.306 --> 04:36.874
I won't tell her, so don't worry about it.

04:36.908 --> 04:39.610
Okay, but now I am worried.
I am worried... now.

04:39.644 --> 04:42.480
Look, I'm taking Moira out for coffees.

04:42.514 --> 04:45.850
We're going up to the
cafÃ©, okay, this afternoon.

04:45.884 --> 04:48.519
And that would be a great
time for you to stop by

04:48.553 --> 04:52.288
and drop the information
about the fundraiser.

04:52.322 --> 04:54.056
Tell me you understand the plan.

04:54.091 --> 04:57.894
Yes, Johnny, I understand the plan!

04:57.928 --> 05:00.229
Jeez! And I don't appreciate
being talked to like a child!

05:00.263 --> 05:01.965
Okay, I'm sorry. Roland...

05:01.999 --> 05:03.700
- Well, I'm sorry. It's a little demeaning.
- Look, I'm sorry.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.602
It's just so important.
This is really important.

05:05.636 --> 05:07.036
I wanna make sure you understand the plan.

05:07.070 --> 05:09.671
Okay! I understand, all right?

05:09.706 --> 05:10.906
- Okay.
- I just think it's awfully short notice

05:10.940 --> 05:12.474
to start planning a fundraiser.

05:12.509 --> 05:14.242
There is no fundraiser!

05:14.276 --> 05:16.211
- Right. No fundraiser.
- It's pretend!

05:16.245 --> 05:19.214
Pretend. It's fun time.

05:22.785 --> 05:27.488
So I... am gonna need a lift to Elmdale.

05:28.690 --> 05:31.393
What does it look like I'm doing?

05:31.427 --> 05:32.494
I don't know, nothing?

05:32.528 --> 05:34.295
I'm working.

05:34.330 --> 05:36.831
- Oh, you are?
- Yes. I have a job

05:36.865 --> 05:39.901
that I just can't leave
to drive you to Elmdale.

05:39.935 --> 05:41.869
Okay... yeah, and I totally respect that.

05:41.904 --> 05:45.273
It's just that I found a
Ganache Torte in Elmdale

05:45.307 --> 05:47.509
and I really need to pick it up
before my mom's birthday thing, so...

05:47.543 --> 05:49.944
I work until six.

05:49.978 --> 05:53.014
Okay, but like is anyone
checking in this afternoon?

05:53.049 --> 05:55.382
- It's a cake.
- It's a torte!

05:55.417 --> 05:57.951
Um... is there something going on?

05:57.985 --> 06:00.487
You could always just hitch-hike?

06:00.522 --> 06:03.390
And wake up chained to a
pole in a trucker's basement?

06:03.425 --> 06:07.227
- Not today.
- Well, I'm working... At my job,

06:07.262 --> 06:11.238
so I can't just up and
leave because you want cake.

06:11.263 --> 06:13.744
Okay. Well, when you put it like that,

06:13.769 --> 06:15.702
it makes me sound ridiculous...

06:15.736 --> 06:19.573
Um... which I'm not.

06:19.607 --> 06:21.874
So... thank you...

06:21.908 --> 06:23.976
For your services this afternoon.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.489 --> 06:37.557
Hey! Hey... sorry I'm late, Johnny.

06:37.591 --> 06:39.125
Had a little memorizing... To do.

06:39.159 --> 06:41.593
Late for... late for what, Roland?

06:41.627 --> 06:44.229
- I don't know what you mean?
- For Jocelyn's big shindig.

06:44.263 --> 06:46.098
I'm here to personally
invite the two of you

06:46.132 --> 06:51.712
to, um, a um... annual,
um, elegant dress-up event

06:51.737 --> 06:53.938
that Jocelyn is hosting.

06:53.973 --> 06:56.508
Um... well, no, I'm not inviting you,

06:56.542 --> 06:59.277
but I'm saying we're...
We'll see each other there...

06:59.312 --> 07:01.946
At the very big event
that Jocelyn is hosting.

07:01.981 --> 07:03.814
The whole town will go to this event.

07:03.848 --> 07:06.617
They'll all be dressed up and um...

07:06.651 --> 07:09.653
Did I... did I say that it's a fundraiser?

07:09.687 --> 07:11.388
Oh, sorry, Johnny. Let me start over here.

07:11.423 --> 07:13.357
Why are you apologizing to me?

07:13.391 --> 07:15.593
You don't have to apologize to me.

07:15.627 --> 07:19.196
No, no. It's a fundraiser
for the thing with the...

07:19.231 --> 07:22.233
Children that...

07:22.267 --> 07:25.936
The-with the mouth... Uh, cleft palates,

07:25.970 --> 07:28.371
and um... Joc' does it every year...

07:28.405 --> 07:30.007
well, uh, Roland, you know what?

07:30.041 --> 07:32.542
We're-we're... Probably just gonna be

07:32.576 --> 07:35.812
hanging around the...
motel on Saturday, you know.

07:35.847 --> 07:38.615
Yeah, no, I'm sure. It's uh...

07:38.650 --> 07:40.817
Hard to look at those kids
and all that, I get it.

07:40.852 --> 07:42.686
But you know what? We'll dress them up too.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.820
Put us down for four tickets.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.922
Really. Oh yes, it's the least we can do

07:46.957 --> 07:49.058
to support Jocelyn's
philanthropic endeavours.

07:49.092 --> 07:51.593
Oh! Okay.

07:51.628 --> 07:54.997
Well, I'm sure Jocelyn
would really appreciate it.

07:55.032 --> 07:56.899
Well, listen, thank you, Roland, for that.

07:56.933 --> 07:58.167
You're welcome.

07:58.201 --> 07:59.068
I think that went well!

07:59.102 --> 08:01.103
Okay, thank you.

08:01.138 --> 08:03.072
Okay. So I guess I'll
see you soon then, Johnny.

08:03.106 --> 08:04.974
Yeah... bye-bye.

08:05.008 --> 08:07.641
Yes, goodbye, Johnny.

08:12.514 --> 08:14.916
Oh, sorry!

08:14.950 --> 08:17.552
Ugh! Could you be going any faster?

08:17.586 --> 08:19.420
Well, we should put that up quick.

08:19.454 --> 08:22.163
Um... so we're planning
this surprise for my mom

08:22.188 --> 08:23.689
that's totally not gonna work

08:23.723 --> 08:26.148
and I'm supposed to ask you
if we can borrow your barn.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.991
But if you can't take the
night off from bedding women,

08:28.026 --> 08:30.961
I totally... understand.

08:30.995 --> 08:32.763
Well, who says I can't do both?

08:38.942 --> 08:40.404
You had a bug in your hair.

08:40.438 --> 08:43.474
Oh.  Ew!

08:51.148 --> 08:53.816
- Jocelyn!
- Moira, hi!

08:53.851 --> 08:56.586
Jocelyn, I'm so glad I've run into you.

08:56.621 --> 08:59.055
Roland was mentioning your
fundraiser earlier today

08:59.089 --> 09:01.023
and it got me thinking...

09:01.058 --> 09:02.219
My what?

09:02.244 --> 09:06.711
Your annual fundraiser for the
children with troubled mouths.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.022
Oh, right. Yes. It's
gonna be q-quite a night.

09:10.057 --> 09:13.893
I hope so, 'cause I'd like to be involved.

09:13.927 --> 09:15.895
- With... ?
- Your fundraiser.

09:15.929 --> 09:18.564
As I'm sure you know, I was on the board

09:18.598 --> 09:21.067
of some of the most
profitable not-profits,

09:21.101 --> 09:23.935
from San Francisco to London.

09:23.970 --> 09:25.937
And after speaking with Roland,

09:25.972 --> 09:29.040
I realized I was remiss not to gift you

09:29.075 --> 09:31.108
with my wealth of experience.

09:31.142 --> 09:34.979
Wow! That's very generous of you, Moira.

09:35.013 --> 09:38.383
I was gonna ask you, but
I didn't wanna impose.

09:38.417 --> 09:42.445
Jocelyn, you must stop
being intimidated by me.

09:42.470 --> 09:44.188
It's unnerving.

09:44.222 --> 09:47.425
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine. Just say thank you.

09:47.459 --> 09:49.539
- Thank you?
- There you go! My pleasure!

09:52.531 --> 09:54.741
Oh,!

09:57.497 --> 09:59.391
What do you mean, you didn't get the cake?

09:59.415 --> 10:03.061
The only Chocolate Ganache cake
I could find, was in Elmdale,

10:03.086 --> 10:05.420
and I asked Stevie to
drive me but she said no

10:05.455 --> 10:06.688
because I think she's going through
something right now. Moira: David!

10:06.723 --> 10:09.027
I don't know. Something with her body.

10:09.052 --> 10:10.892
David, I need you.

10:10.926 --> 10:14.229
I was speaking to Jocelyn about this
fundraiser she's apparently organizing...

10:14.264 --> 10:16.998
Whoa-whoa, you-you
were talking to Jocelyn?

10:17.032 --> 10:19.301
Yes, about the fundraiser,
and the poor thing

10:19.335 --> 10:21.535
looked like a deer
caught in the headlights.

10:21.570 --> 10:25.506
And I cannot stand by and watch this woman

10:25.540 --> 10:28.643
drive a perfectly worthy
cause into the ground.

10:28.677 --> 10:31.045
So, David, you and I...
We're gonna help her.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.215
Okay.

10:34.250 --> 10:37.786
I asked you to get her
invited to the fundraiser,

10:37.820 --> 10:40.851
not involved in the fundraiser.

10:40.876 --> 10:43.009
The fundraiser was your idea!

10:43.043 --> 10:44.143
You didn't think your
mother would get involved

10:44.177 --> 10:46.178
in planning a fundraiser?

10:46.213 --> 10:48.147
My God, she had Hilary shaking last year

10:48.181 --> 10:51.050
at the Clinton foundation dinner.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.820
God! Roland. Roland. Stupid Roland.

10:53.854 --> 10:58.057
Roland?! How did Roland
get involved in this?

10:58.091 --> 11:00.059
I got him involved, it
was a bad mistake, okay?

11:00.093 --> 11:01.360
But look, it'll be fine.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.530
I will get the cake with your sister.

11:03.564 --> 11:05.732
All you've gotta do is keep
your mother under control.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.133
The North Korean army could
not keep my mother under control

11:08.167 --> 11:09.200
when it comes to event planning.

11:27.252 --> 11:30.881
What? Huh? Oh!

11:32.524 --> 11:35.092
How long was I sleeping?

11:35.126 --> 11:36.293
I dunno, like forty-five maybe.

11:36.327 --> 11:38.729
Oh?

11:38.764 --> 11:40.765
Where are we?

11:40.799 --> 11:43.133
Um, we're almost there.

11:43.168 --> 11:45.702
The last sign I saw said
"exit Elmdale," so...

11:45.736 --> 11:47.103
I haven't seen it yet, but...

11:47.137 --> 11:48.504
We should be getting there soon.

11:48.539 --> 11:51.174
The last sign said "exit Elmdale?"

11:51.208 --> 11:54.177
Mm-hmm.

11:54.211 --> 11:57.346
Well, that was the exit to Elmdale.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.848
We've gone too far, we've gotta turn back!

11:58.883 --> 12:01.985
- But you were sleeping!
- Well, wake me up!

12:02.019 --> 12:03.352
No! Because you're so
grumpy when you wake-

12:03.387 --> 12:04.787
like you're grumpy right now.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.927
Well, Moira, in regards to the decorations,

12:11.961 --> 12:14.296
David was kind enough to offer me

12:14.330 --> 12:17.299
an incredibly long list of
the things to stay away from.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.769
Darling, one does not
just stick a red nose on it

12:19.803 --> 12:21.537
and call it an event.

12:21.571 --> 12:23.606
There is an order to these things.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.008
Okay, here we go.

12:26.042 --> 12:29.075
Again, what is the
organization that it's for?

12:29.145 --> 12:31.713
- The surgeons...
- Uh... the doctors who un-cleft the mouths.

12:31.747 --> 12:32.981
Never heard of it.

12:33.016 --> 12:34.983
And who are the trustees?

12:35.018 --> 12:36.651
I don't think they're gonna come.

12:36.685 --> 12:39.388
Oh, how very churlish of
them. How much are tickets?

12:39.422 --> 12:41.356
Um... free?

12:41.391 --> 12:43.024
We haven't figured out
the ticket price yet.

12:43.058 --> 12:44.926
I'm not paying for this thing.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.962
Oh my God! Do you people know
what the word fundraising means?

12:47.996 --> 12:50.097
Why don't you leave that up to us.

12:50.132 --> 12:52.266
Jocelyn, I need your
timeline and your checklist.

12:52.301 --> 12:54.741
Your plan book.

12:54.766 --> 12:57.238
Well, we have a plan.
It's just we haven't...

12:57.272 --> 12:58.639
You know, we're just, we're still working-

12:58.673 --> 13:01.409
Listen, Jocelyn is doing
the best that she can...

13:01.443 --> 13:04.177
Considering what little
Jocelyn has to work with.

13:04.211 --> 13:07.581
David, personal comments are in bad taste.

13:07.615 --> 13:10.317
Okay, I'm trying to make
sense of these flowers.

13:10.351 --> 13:12.285
What is wrong with the flowers?

13:12.320 --> 13:15.656
They're seasonal and they... Tie
in all of the other design elements

13:15.690 --> 13:19.031
that Jocelyn has come up with.

13:20.281 --> 13:24.163
David, I'm sorry, but
it's coup d'etat time.

13:24.197 --> 13:27.299
If we don't force Jocelyn
to step down this moment,

13:27.334 --> 13:29.469
I don't know how we're
gonna pull of this nightmare.

13:29.503 --> 13:32.572
Why don't you just sit this one out then?

13:32.606 --> 13:34.139
And you are?

13:36.510 --> 13:38.057
So... David?

13:41.047 --> 13:42.766
I see.

13:42.791 --> 13:46.493
Clearly you don't need the help of the most
prominent philanthropist in the country.

13:46.532 --> 13:47.752
No.

13:47.787 --> 13:50.422
Fine. I wish you all the best.

13:52.192 --> 13:53.825
No, seriously, I might leave.

13:57.230 --> 14:01.648
Okay, last warning. In three... two...

14:03.002 --> 14:05.836
Oh my God.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.742
Well, I think she is gonna
be really surprised...

14:11.776 --> 14:13.478
don't you?

14:19.184 --> 14:20.284
Nine ninety-nine.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.919
And I'm telling you, you can't go wrong.

14:21.953 --> 14:24.187
You go into a jewellery store,
you're gonna spend thousands.

14:24.222 --> 14:26.991
We have made it so simple...

14:27.025 --> 14:30.360
Oh, David, I don't know how you
don't go mad with those people.

14:30.395 --> 14:32.730
Well, those people are...

14:32.764 --> 14:36.734
Putting a lot of energy into
raising money for those kids.

14:36.768 --> 14:40.027
Jump ship. Save yourself.

14:40.052 --> 14:42.438
Okay, I'm gonna ask you to put
some pieces together here for me.

14:42.472 --> 14:46.042
We are throwing a "fundraiser"

14:46.076 --> 14:49.846
that just so happens to be on
the same night as your birthday.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.749
Must you rub it in?

14:52.783 --> 14:57.186
We're throwing a
"fundraiser" on your birthday.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.788
Now you're just being cruel.

14:58.822 --> 15:02.491
The fundraiser isn't real.
It's not a real thing.

15:02.526 --> 15:08.540
Oh... you're planning a birthday thing...

15:08.572 --> 15:11.775
- Mm-hmm. - That I'm not
supposed to know about.

15:11.822 --> 15:13.869
Mm-mm.

15:13.903 --> 15:15.871
In a barn?

15:20.477 --> 15:22.878
We can't afford the candles. They're $2.49.

15:22.912 --> 15:24.312
They don't just come with the cake?

15:24.314 --> 15:25.814
No, apparently not.

15:25.848 --> 15:28.216
Like matches when you buy cigarettes?

15:28.250 --> 15:31.550
- You smoke?
- Um... no.

15:32.655 --> 15:35.090
Can't we just ask them to give them to us?

15:35.124 --> 15:38.025
This is not some co-op commune, Alexis.

15:38.060 --> 15:40.795
You know, if there's a price
tag on it, you gotta pay for it.

15:40.829 --> 15:43.864
Not if you just... take them.

15:43.899 --> 15:47.134
Well, that would be low
bottom behavior, wouldn't it?

15:47.168 --> 15:48.723
Okay, well, how do you
think I got these glasses

15:48.748 --> 15:50.559
from the gas station?

15:50.584 --> 15:52.272
You stole sunglasses?!

15:52.307 --> 15:54.875
Yeah! It's a gas station.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.478
Oh my God, I raised a
thief. Go wait in the car!

15:57.512 --> 15:59.179
Wait in the car while I pay for this.

15:59.214 --> 16:01.915
Ugh!

16:04.219 --> 16:05.854
- Hi.
- Hi. Johnny Rose.

16:05.879 --> 16:07.312
I ordered a birthday cake.

16:07.337 --> 16:08.504
Yeah, Chocolate Ganache?

16:08.529 --> 16:09.963
That's right.

16:16.026 --> 16:17.827
Boy, it smells uh...

16:20.165 --> 16:21.899
So delicious in here.

16:29.042 --> 16:30.610
Whoa! Thank you.

16:30.644 --> 16:33.246
There we go, my dear.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.848
Wait, wait, wait. One last check.

16:35.882 --> 16:38.917
Gorgeous. Perfection.

16:38.952 --> 16:41.861
Like your father the day I married him.

16:41.886 --> 16:44.564
Look at us, the Roses,

16:44.589 --> 16:48.853
attending this town's most
illustrious fundraising gala.

16:48.878 --> 16:51.318
I think you're overselling it just a bit.

16:51.353 --> 16:53.888
Well, I don't see any
stragglers, so shall we go in?

16:53.922 --> 16:55.283
I think we're fashionably late enough.

16:55.316 --> 16:57.565
There's nothing
fashionable about this, but-

16:57.592 --> 16:59.593
after you, my dear.

17:01.572 --> 17:04.673
Where are all the patrons?

17:04.704 --> 17:08.008
Well, I don't know. Do
we have the wrong night?

17:08.041 --> 17:10.743
Surprise!

17:10.778 --> 17:13.913
What?! There's no fundraiser?!

17:13.948 --> 17:16.516
You're just here to celebrate me?

17:16.550 --> 17:19.685
Oh, never in the history of surprises

17:19.719 --> 17:22.788
has one been so delightfully blindsided.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.039
- Darling...
- Oh...

17:26.064 --> 17:27.630
Okay, who told her?

17:55.159 --> 17:57.527
- Oh, hi.
- So your party's a big success.

17:57.561 --> 18:00.162
Congratulations.

18:00.196 --> 18:02.998
- Yeah, thank you.
- Your mom sure seemed surprised.

18:03.033 --> 18:06.065
Yeah, my mom was... Very surprised.

18:07.471 --> 18:09.472
And you got your cake.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.575
Yeah, remember this cake? I'd
asked you to... Help me get it.

18:12.609 --> 18:15.711
Yeah, so... I need to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.181
I think it's just that this whole-

18:19.215 --> 18:21.583
it's that lady time, huh?

18:21.617 --> 18:22.918
- Friend thing...
- Oh.

18:22.953 --> 18:26.588
Is proving to be a bit tricky

18:26.622 --> 18:30.132
and I think that in
building that barrier up,

18:30.157 --> 18:33.595
I may have... built it a little high.

18:33.629 --> 18:38.094
Okay. Um... well, if
the barrier's come down,

18:38.126 --> 18:41.503
can two friends dance? Is that okay?

18:41.537 --> 18:45.107
Uh... I normally only slow
dance with strangers, at bars...

18:45.141 --> 18:47.089
- Right.
- After I've had a few...

18:47.114 --> 18:48.443
Uh-huh.

18:48.478 --> 18:52.101
But um... I can make an exception.

18:52.126 --> 18:53.284
Okay.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.118
- Let's dance.
- Okay.

19:05.027 --> 19:07.996
Hey!

19:08.030 --> 19:12.926
Um... you look really... Amazing.

19:12.951 --> 19:17.638
Well, I didn't wanna be the
only one not wearing a suit.

19:17.672 --> 19:20.908
Um, did you have to kill
a man to get it, or... ?

19:20.942 --> 19:22.410
I did.

19:22.444 --> 19:24.912
It took me a couple to find one in my size.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.760
But um... you clean up well.

19:27.785 --> 19:29.619
Ugh! Barely.

19:29.653 --> 19:32.922
I wore this thing to prom
like a thousand years ago,

19:32.957 --> 19:35.692
but... it did bring me
some luck that night,

19:35.726 --> 19:38.559
so I wore it here tonight.

19:38.584 --> 19:40.304
You were planning on getting lucky tonight?

19:44.616 --> 19:47.753
So um... where is Ted?

19:48.025 --> 19:51.098
Um... he is at um...

19:51.885 --> 19:56.755
Like a... a conference or
something tonight, so...

20:01.128 --> 20:03.797
Do you wanna dance?

20:03.861 --> 20:07.569
Yes... I do.

20:07.975 --> 20:09.943
Alexis!

20:10.092 --> 20:12.460
- Ted?!
- Hey!

20:12.485 --> 20:14.546
What're you doing here?

20:14.571 --> 20:15.864
Well, I had someone take my last seminar.

20:15.898 --> 20:17.266
I didn't wanna miss this.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.767
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.302
Come on, let's dance.

20:20.337 --> 20:22.871
Great suit, bud.

20:22.905 --> 20:24.339
Thanks.

20:26.509 --> 20:28.677
Killed somebody for it.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.398
Oh, I love my party, John.

20:42.432 --> 20:45.067
But please don't ever do it again.

20:45.102 --> 20:47.870
Well, the surprise was on me

20:47.905 --> 20:50.817
'cause this town cleaned
itself up pretty well.

21:03.311 --> 21:04.787
