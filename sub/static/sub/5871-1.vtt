(Crickets)

00:21.455 --> 00:22.523
Hear anything?

00:22.556 --> 00:23.791
Nope.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.362
Bev?

00:28.396 --> 00:30.164
Nope.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.100
This thing's stupid.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.202
You know what isn't stupid?

00:34.235 --> 00:36.604
Your birthday present.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.075
What is it?

00:41.109 --> 00:42.643
Just open it.

00:46.214 --> 00:49.283
I can't believe you stole
this from your dad's office.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.719
Let's try it.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.724
Is this Jewish?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.392
You mean Hebrew?

00:58.426 --> 00:59.727
Right, Yossi?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.462
Yeah, but it's not Hebrew.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.098
I think it's Chinese.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.399
How does this thing work?

01:05.433 --> 01:07.168
Well, it's a spirit board.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.803
You're supposed to contact
people or ask it questions.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.140
Like dead people?

01:12.173 --> 01:14.808
Or is Bev going to kiss you?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.777
Shut up, Max.

01:16.810 --> 01:17.711
What?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.880
I'm just stating the obvious.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.416
I think just dead people.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.419
Ask it a question already.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.258
Did my mom and dad get me
the BMX bike that I wanted?

01:46.340 --> 01:49.177
Does Beverly Morgan like Yossi?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.317
This thing is also stupid.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.485
Maybe because
you're not asking it

01:57.518 --> 01:59.387
The right questions.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.323
Hey, Bev.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.857
Your parents are here.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.626
- Oh, okay.
- And you two?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.195
It's time to get to sleep.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.196
Alright, I promised
your dad that you

02:08.229 --> 02:09.497
Would be in bed
before nine, pal.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.431
Alright boys?

02:10.464 --> 02:11.332
Okay, Dad.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.266
Okay, Mr. T.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.834
Alrighty.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.671
You know, I
think Max asked one

02:17.705 --> 02:19.507
Right question on the board?

02:19.540 --> 02:22.176
Which one?

02:25.213 --> 02:26.580
Gross!

02:27.548 --> 02:29.617
You going to miss me?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.552
Always.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.425
Okay, Romeo,
let's get to bed.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.837
(Scary music)

03:04.252 --> 03:06.554
(Heavy breathing)

03:06.587 --> 03:08.456
Quit it, Max.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.648
Max, is that you?

03:44.492 --> 03:46.294
(Yelling)

03:47.661 --> 03:50.331
(Telephone)

03:54.602 --> 03:56.437
Hello?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.307
Hello?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.374
Aba?

04:00.408 --> 04:03.311
Yossi! Are you
okay? What happened?

04:03.344 --> 04:06.380
It's Max, something's wrong.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.383
Yosef.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.453
I took the Ouija board
and let Max play with it and

04:12.486 --> 04:13.554
What Ouija board?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.389
The one from my office?

04:15.423 --> 04:17.458
Yes, I'm sorry, I...

04:17.491 --> 04:19.360
It's out.

04:20.528 --> 04:23.297
Yosef, you find a
place to hide at Max's

04:23.331 --> 04:25.366
And you don't come
out 'til I get you!

04:25.799 --> 04:28.869
Yosef! Yosef!

04:40.481 --> 04:43.283
(Scary music)

05:21.855 --> 05:24.458
Show yourself demon!

07:00.788 --> 07:03.423
Yousef?

07:59.613 --> 08:02.516
Mark?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.621
Aba?

08:12.593 --> 08:15.563
Yousef, run!

08:23.871 --> 08:26.106
Hello?

08:28.776 --> 08:30.711
Oh.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.513
Yeah.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.183
Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.753
Bye.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.166
I'm so glad I finally
get to meet my grandfather

08:53.200 --> 08:54.702
For the first time,

08:54.735 --> 08:57.270
Right before he's about to die.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.073
Yeah, I guess I deserve that.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.709
You think?

09:01.742 --> 09:06.313
Look, you want to blame Dov
for keeping us apart, not me.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.649
Why do you always
call him that?

09:08.682 --> 09:09.583
Because that's his name.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.718
I know, but he's your father.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.020
Was my father.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.623
I haven't seen that
man in over 30 years.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.661
I'm having a hard
time figuring out

09:20.694 --> 09:22.095
Why he would put
you in a foster home

09:22.129 --> 09:23.631
For no reason.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.732
Because your grandfather is an

09:24.765 --> 09:26.366
Extremely selfish man.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.669
Just sucks is all.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.637
Especially considering
you can't remember

09:29.670 --> 09:33.240
Your childhood because
of some stupid accident.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.275
Yeah.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.745
It does suck.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.280
But I had no control over that.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.749
But you know the
one thing I do have

09:41.782 --> 09:44.685
Control over is
being your father.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.119
And just so you
know, I would never

09:46.153 --> 09:49.923
Ever do what Dov
did to me to you.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.693
I care about you way too much.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.263
I care about you too, Dad.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.738
Come on, Dad.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.080
(Doorbell)

11:26.787 --> 11:28.722
He's stable now.

11:28.756 --> 11:31.391
But we're not sure
how much time he has.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.061
Does he know we're here?

11:34.094 --> 11:37.430
No. I did has you asked.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.333
I didn't tell him
you were coming.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.770
Thank you.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.205
I'll leave you to it then.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.876
You okay?

12:12.933 --> 12:15.268
Grandpa?

12:18.471 --> 12:20.740
You're a handsome young man.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.743
What's your name?

12:24.812 --> 12:26.413
Noah.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.482
I'm your grandson.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.318
I don't have a grandson.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.321
Yes. Yes you do.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.197
Yousef you're...

12:46.433 --> 12:49.536
You're not supposed
to be in this house.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.240
It's too dangerous.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.276
I think after 30 years I
actually deserve an explanation.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.946
What is so dangerous
about an old house?

12:58.979 --> 13:03.984
It's not the house,
it's what's in it.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.958
Noah, leave the room.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.826
- Dad
- No, go.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.270
I did what I had
to do to protect you.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.138
Protect me?

13:25.172 --> 13:28.876
You self-righteous piece
of crap, protect me?

13:28.909 --> 13:31.879
I spent 10 years getting my
ass kicked in foster homes

13:31.912 --> 13:34.848
Where was your protection then?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.485
It was for your own good.

13:39.887 --> 13:44.958
Now, please leave.

13:46.093 --> 13:49.396
Before it's too late.

13:51.364 --> 13:55.602
I know you're not an
observant man anymore.

13:58.105 --> 14:02.242
But promise me you will
never lose your faith,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.411
Especially in me.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.380
That's easy.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.450
I never had it to begin with.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.219
Games on in 15,
babe, in and out.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.926
Geez, what's their problem?

14:52.960 --> 14:55.262
You'd think somebody died.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.936
Please behave yourself, Jeff.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.437
What's in it for me?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.239
What do you mean?

15:06.273 --> 15:09.542
We haven't done it in forever.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.079
I wonder why that is.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.551
Oh wow, Beverly Morgan.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.320
You look amazing.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.990
You don't look
half bad yourself.

15:24.657 --> 15:28.128
I am so sorry for
your loss, Yossi.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.396
Thank you,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.631
And it's Joe now.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.435
Joe. Okay.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.509
Hi, Noah Barnett,
at your service.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.978
Chloe.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.647
I'm sorry for your loss.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.085
You must have made this.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.253
Why?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.455
Because it smells heavenly

15:55.488 --> 15:57.991
Can I go now?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.161
I have some flowers for ya.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.063
Uh,

16:03.096 --> 16:04.364
Sorry about your dad, man.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.533
He was a weird old dude.

16:06.566 --> 16:10.137
Yeah. Yeah I should
probably get rid of these.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.505
I just paid 35.99 for those.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.374
You just going to chuck them?

16:14.407 --> 16:17.210
No, in the Jewish tradition
we don't believe in flowers

16:17.244 --> 16:19.412
For mourning, so that's why

16:23.050 --> 16:24.517
You know what, thank you.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.153
These are great.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.389
I'll go put these in water.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.093
Noah?

16:33.126 --> 16:34.327
Yep.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.729
They're not even real.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.405
This sucks.

16:52.079 --> 16:55.182
Joe, I'm so sorry.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.717
Non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, that's rough.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.387
Yeah it was.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.389
Especially on Noah.

17:02.422 --> 17:06.425
Towards the end, seeing
his mother like that,

17:06.459 --> 17:09.396
Knowing there was nothing
he could do to help.

17:12.165 --> 17:15.268
It really did a
number on both of us.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.506
I know exactly how you feel.

17:19.539 --> 17:24.544
We lost Chloe's dad, my husband,

17:25.244 --> 17:27.214
To colon cancer three years ago.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.449
I'm so sorry.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.551
Thanks.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.391
Let's talk about something,

17:38.425 --> 17:40.093
A little less depressing.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.462
I think that's a great idea.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.167
So Jeff, huh?

17:48.168 --> 17:50.570
Okay, good subject.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.632
Hey, remember when
we were kids your dad

18:19.666 --> 18:23.270
Wouldn't let us be in the
same room alone together?

18:23.636 --> 18:25.438
Oh, the good old days.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.507
We're all grown up now though.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.242
Yes we are.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.611
You were really cute
back then though.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.381
Your glasses, your little curls.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.350
What happened?

18:37.384 --> 18:39.186
Well I don't have
the glasses anymore

18:39.219 --> 18:41.821
And my little curls
are now big curls.

18:41.854 --> 18:46.259
I have much bigger curls
than what I had before.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.601
(Suspenseful music)

19:44.251 --> 19:46.519
So I know you and
Noah have to get back,

19:46.553 --> 19:48.421
But, we're actually
going to a cabin

19:48.455 --> 19:51.424
On Friday if you'd
like to join us.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.992
Oh.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.363
That sounds really
cool, but I think um

19:56.396 --> 19:59.366
There's just a million
things to do around here

19:59.399 --> 20:01.534
You know, and Noah
has school on Monday,

20:01.568 --> 20:04.203
So I think we're just
going to sit this one out.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.240
Maybe next time.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.353
(Thud on wall)

20:29.796 --> 20:32.599
(Pounding)

20:34.066 --> 20:35.402
Noah?

20:35.435 --> 20:37.370
What was that?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.273
Yeah dad.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.616
(Scary music)

21:01.661 --> 21:03.896
Thanks.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.065
Anytime.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.934
It's good to have you back.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.442
If you change your
mind, let me know.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.377
I will.

21:33.726 --> 21:38.731
Ouija, or spirit
board, predates to
China around 1100 A.D.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.769
People commonly use
the board as a way

21:42.802 --> 21:45.505
To contact the dead.

21:47.039 --> 21:51.077
Yeah. I mean what's the
worst that could happen?

21:52.011 --> 21:55.515
Okay board, let's see
what you have to say.

22:19.906 --> 22:24.544
I'm looking for my
mother, Jennifer Barnett.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.116
Mom are you there?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.953
Hello?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.756
Anyone there?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.525
Mom?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.493
Grandpa?

22:40.527 --> 22:42.629
Whoopi?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.402
(Voices)

22:54.941 --> 22:57.944
I knew this thing was bullshit.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.624
(Voices)

23:20.500 --> 23:22.902
(Scary music)

23:39.085 --> 23:41.554
Hello?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.513
What the?

24:14.854 --> 24:18.457
One. Never play alone.

24:19.559 --> 24:22.529
Two. Never let planchette
count down through

24:22.562 --> 24:25.632
The numbers or backwards
through the alphabet.

24:26.999 --> 24:30.537
Three. Never mention God.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.240
Four. Always say goodbye.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.690
I mean, one out
of four ain't bad.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.548
(Door slams)

25:49.682 --> 25:52.284
Hey Dad, does
grandpa have a cat?

25:52.318 --> 25:54.587
I don't think so,
he was allergic.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.888
Why?

25:55.922 --> 25:57.790
No reason.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.599
So, this is it.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.235
Yep.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.637
Look, if you change your mind

26:10.670 --> 26:13.606
Here is the address
to the cabin.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.375
Cell service can be a little
shoddy so just show up, okay?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.644
Okay.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.211
Come on, babe!

26:19.245 --> 26:20.780
We're late for Jeff-town!

26:20.813 --> 26:23.182
Population beers and burgers!

26:26.953 --> 26:29.255
Take care of yourself, Yossi.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.791
Joe.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.826
Sorry, old habits.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.695
Bye, Noah.

26:39.799 --> 26:42.702
So, cabin?

26:42.735 --> 26:44.637
No.

26:46.205 --> 26:49.141
(Upbeat music)

27:04.824 --> 27:07.660
[Jeff] And you make
great sandwiches too.

27:07.694 --> 27:10.663
What do you do?

27:10.997 --> 27:14.266
What do you contribute
to the household?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.703
You drink beer and
you watch football.

27:16.736 --> 27:17.837
And I cook steaks.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.205
Occasionally.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.407
Only when I make you.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.043
Who does the rest of the stuff?

27:24.076 --> 27:26.713
Who fixed the sink the
other day when it got clogged?

27:29.315 --> 27:31.684
What?

27:31.718 --> 27:33.720
Nothing.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.723
We're not going to the cabin.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.925
Fine.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.397
You always said that
grandpa never took you

27:45.431 --> 27:48.267
Anywhere or did anything cool.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.736
I mean it's not like
you're forcing me

27:49.769 --> 27:51.370
To leave home like he did,

27:51.403 --> 27:53.773
But I am going to college.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.375
Don't you want to have
some fun before I go?

28:02.782 --> 28:03.750
What are you doing?

28:03.783 --> 28:05.051
This isn't our exit.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.085
I know.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.887
I'm just proving that I'm cool.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.056
It's not cool if you
say you're cool dad.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.758
Okay.

28:11.791 --> 28:12.725
Well how about
this, I will promise

28:12.759 --> 28:14.426
Not to tell anyone the
only reason you want to

28:14.460 --> 28:17.797
Go to the cabin is so you
can hang out with Chloe.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.431
Have I mentioned you're
the coolest dad ever?

28:19.465 --> 28:22.134
It's not cool to mention it.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.304
Hi guys, sorry,
you just caught me

28:58.337 --> 29:01.040
At the end of my
sun salutations,

29:01.073 --> 29:04.877
I'm working on my
yogi certificate.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.079
You must be Beverly.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.414
Nice to meet you.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.283
Jeff. Hi Chloe.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.453
Teenagers.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.322
Well, make yourselves at home.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.324
The door to the
main house is open,

29:18.357 --> 29:20.426
I'm just going to shower up and

29:20.459 --> 29:21.994
I'll show you guys around.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.263
I'll be right down the
way if you need anything.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.264
Thank you

29:25.297 --> 29:27.934
Thank you. So much.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.969
Get the bags.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.807
What's a yogi
anyway though, a bear?

29:35.474 --> 29:38.811
Yep. She steals
picnic baskets.

29:38.845 --> 29:41.513
That's what I thought.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.015
Let's go.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.516
Jesus, this isn't a
cabin, it's a mansion.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.319
It's like Pablo
Escobar's rustic getaway.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.321
Would you uh, watch
your language please?

30:22.354 --> 30:24.891
What? We're Jewish,
I can say Jesus.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.193
All I'm saying is the cabin
is bigger than our house,

30:27.226 --> 30:29.929
And there's probably a bunch
of cocaine hidden in the walls.

30:29.962 --> 30:30.963
Hey!

30:30.997 --> 30:32.865
What do you know about cocaine?

30:32.899 --> 30:34.600
You know, don't, don't tell me.

30:34.633 --> 30:35.467
Hey!

30:35.501 --> 30:36.869
You guys made it!

30:36.903 --> 30:37.603
Yep.

30:37.636 --> 30:38.537
Good to see you.

30:38.570 --> 30:39.505
Welcome.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.174
Yeah he, guilted me
into it on the highway.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.877
Plus I thought it'd be nice
to make some "cool memories"

30:44.911 --> 30:46.412
Before he goes off to school.

30:46.445 --> 30:47.579
That's really nice.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.548
Chloe's inside and...

30:52.451 --> 30:54.186
Jeff's at the market,

30:54.220 --> 30:55.554
So why don't I show you inside?

30:55.587 --> 30:56.889
Sure, yeah.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.125
Jeff's at the market...

31:27.086 --> 31:28.587
Sup dude?

31:28.620 --> 31:30.056
Sup?

31:30.089 --> 31:30.822
Did you guys change your mind?

31:30.856 --> 31:33.059
Yeah. Yeah,
something like that.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.294
How was the market?

31:35.327 --> 31:37.196
Find anything nice?

31:37.229 --> 31:39.298
Oh, you mean Ronnie.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.368
Ronnie she's like
the yogi around here.

31:42.401 --> 31:46.038
Takes care of stuff when
people are around, whatever

31:46.072 --> 31:49.241
Recent divorcee.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.045
On the prowl.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.047
You know, because
she's a cougar.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.649
Like an older, you get it?

31:57.683 --> 31:59.618
No, I get it.

32:01.420 --> 32:05.457
So how does Bev feel about you
doing yoga with other women?

32:05.491 --> 32:06.993
You listen here, Rabbi.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.095
If you even think about
opening your mouth to Bev,

32:09.128 --> 32:12.031
You'll be in matzo straw
for the rest of your life.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.700
That's not how matzo,

32:15.501 --> 32:18.037
That's not how matzo works.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.393
Sweet.

32:45.064 --> 32:45.998
Hey

32:46.032 --> 32:47.499
Hey, babe.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.700
Where are you going?

32:48.734 --> 32:50.036
I forgot the
bread at the market.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.437
- Get it later.
- I can't

32:51.470 --> 32:54.173
- We have our family hike.
- We can't have
sandwiches without bread.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.041
Okay?

32:55.074 --> 32:58.010
You know the hike
is not my thing, okay?

32:58.377 --> 33:00.046
I'll be back later.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.248
Love you.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.397
- Hey.
- How are you?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.766
Better now.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.241
Chloe?

34:35.274 --> 34:37.143
Chloe!

34:37.176 --> 34:38.543
Yes, mother.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.646
We are going on a hike,
would you like to join us?

34:40.679 --> 34:42.148
Are you serious?

34:42.181 --> 34:44.081
I'd rather hang out
with Noah all weekend.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.121
Looks like it's
just you and me, Joe.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.790
Just like old times.

34:51.822 --> 34:53.891
Bye.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.760
Huh?

34:54.793 --> 34:55.893
Bye.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.429
Okay, bye.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.508
I know you're there, perv.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.925
How'd you get in here?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.360
So.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.662
So.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.365
Jeff, huh?

35:34.266 --> 35:36.302
Come on, he means well.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.304
- Yeah?
- Yeah, he really does.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.305
I mean I know he's
a pain and all,

35:39.338 --> 35:40.906
But, he really is a good guy.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.313
I met him online.

35:47.346 --> 35:48.647
After my husband passed away.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.217
Of course you met
that guy online.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.218
What's that supposed to mean?

35:52.251 --> 35:53.252
Nothing.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.521
I just, uh, I guess I can't
really picture swiping

35:55.554 --> 35:57.556
Right on that guy.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.558
Swipe right?

35:59.591 --> 36:02.361
Yeah, yeah, I've
seen Noah swipe right,

36:02.394 --> 36:04.630
He's in his room just swiping,

36:04.663 --> 36:06.465
At least I think it's swiping.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.366
No, I've never swiped.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.801
I don't believe in
swiping before marriage.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.840
Bev?

36:14.873 --> 36:16.242
Yeah.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.610
You okay?

36:22.348 --> 36:24.683
I don't know.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.321
I think I made a mistake.

36:30.756 --> 36:33.592
He means well and all,

36:33.625 --> 36:37.263
But we're just two
different people,

36:37.896 --> 36:41.933
And at my age there
aren't many options.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.871
I find that pretty
hard to believe.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.877
Watch out I can
still beat you up.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.579
You can try,
bring it, bring it.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.282
It's on.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.218
(Moaning)

37:08.594 --> 37:11.563
Oh my goddess!

37:16.435 --> 37:19.305
What's with all
the hippie shit?

37:19.338 --> 37:21.873
I'm a shamanic priestess.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.610
Well, I was ordained online.

37:25.477 --> 37:28.414
I thought all
shamans were dudes.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.817
Shamans by nature are women.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.320
The first shaman was
said to be a woman.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.554
Why do you think male
shamans are always wearing

37:35.587 --> 37:37.989
Women's clothing
and assuming mostly

37:38.023 --> 37:40.826
Female gendered behavior?

37:41.460 --> 37:42.461
I don't know I just
thought they liked to

37:42.494 --> 37:45.831
Wear dresses and
dress up like women.

37:45.864 --> 37:50.736
So, since you're a
shaman do you like

37:50.769 --> 37:55.006
Heal crap and talk to ghosts?
Or I don't know...

37:55.040 --> 37:58.610
Yes, if I can properly
tap into the spirit world.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.312
I can.

38:03.014 --> 38:06.385
How about I
properly tap into you?

38:17.496 --> 38:20.832
(Scary music)

38:25.504 --> 38:26.805
No, your dad.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.774
Remember he wore that
really short miniskirt

38:28.807 --> 38:30.676
That one year, where did
he even get that from?

38:30.709 --> 38:32.811
Did you give it to him?
Weirdos

38:32.844 --> 38:34.012
Don't, don't make me
think about that short skirt.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.347
I don't want to
think about that.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.515
He had the most hideous legs

38:36.548 --> 38:37.683
And it kind of went
up in the back.

38:37.716 --> 38:41.553
- Oh hey.
- Jeff, hi.

38:41.587 --> 38:44.490
Did you just get
back from the market?

38:44.523 --> 38:45.657
Yep.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.560
You guys are awfully chummy huh?

38:48.594 --> 38:51.363
Just catching up on old times.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.732
Huh. I'd love to hear
about your old times

38:53.765 --> 38:56.402
With my girlfriend, Joe.

38:57.836 --> 39:01.039
Well Joe and his dad
used to dress up for

39:01.072 --> 39:03.909
Wait, what was it
called again, Yos?

39:03.942 --> 39:05.411
Purim.

39:05.444 --> 39:08.013
Purim, that's right.

39:08.614 --> 39:11.550
And apparently, there
was this Persian king

39:11.583 --> 39:14.920
Who planned to have all the
Jewish people killed, and...

39:14.953 --> 39:18.390
The holiday is to celebrate
the people that saved them

39:18.424 --> 39:20.892
And foiled his plan, basically.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.396
Bummer.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.466
No, actually it
was pretty great.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.401
I mean the girls used
to dress up like boys

39:29.435 --> 39:31.703
And the boys used to
dress up like girls

39:31.737 --> 39:35.474
And they would sing songs
and play with noisemakers

39:36.107 --> 39:38.477
And it was really great.

39:39.611 --> 39:43.482
Yeah, well, you know
shamans are actually girls?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.689
What was that?

39:50.722 --> 39:52.724
I don't know.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.526
I'm confused.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.562
Of course you met
that guy online.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.096
(Laughing)

39:58.129 --> 39:59.465
Shut up.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.600
Oh God, I did.

40:01.633 --> 40:05.637
Smart phones, dumb people.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.673
Salud.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.712
I love you too.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.146
(Knocking)

40:15.180 --> 40:16.782
Hang on!

40:20.018 --> 40:22.020
Come in.

40:22.488 --> 40:23.455
Hey.

40:23.489 --> 40:25.223
What are you doing?

40:25.256 --> 40:26.458
Nothin'.

40:26.492 --> 40:27.626
Sure.

40:27.659 --> 40:30.629
Dinner's ready, so
you should wash up.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.231
And buddy you might want
to change that shirt,

40:33.264 --> 40:35.901
You've been wearing it
for like, three days.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.103
Fine.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.106
Just looking out for you.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.141
Okay, Dad.

41:04.530 --> 41:07.566
(Scary music)

41:15.674 --> 41:17.643
Get out!

41:18.877 --> 41:21.513
(Guitar music)

41:32.257 --> 41:35.527
So, um, kids, did
you have fun today?

41:35.561 --> 41:37.596
Oh yeah.

41:40.566 --> 41:43.635
What about you Jeff,
did you have fun?

41:47.038 --> 41:48.774
Jeff?

41:49.274 --> 41:50.709
Jeff?

41:50.742 --> 41:52.143
Huh?

41:52.177 --> 41:54.546
Did you have fun today?

41:54.580 --> 41:57.182
Yeah. It was fine.

41:59.718 --> 42:02.588
Anyone seen my dad?

42:06.592 --> 42:09.628
I'm going to go find him.

42:20.639 --> 42:21.807
This is good.

42:27.879 --> 42:30.248
(Pounding)

42:33.051 --> 42:35.353
Hey, we're all waiting
for you out here,

42:35.386 --> 42:37.555
Noah, I thought I told
you to get ready for...

42:39.791 --> 42:41.827
(Voices)

42:49.801 --> 42:52.604
Noah?

42:54.239 --> 42:57.275
What? I was changing my shirt.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.210
(Voices)

42:59.244 --> 43:00.779
Do you hear that?

43:00.812 --> 43:03.381
Hear what?

43:03.414 --> 43:05.784
Sup? Earth to Joe.

43:05.817 --> 43:09.655
You coming to dinner or what?

43:10.021 --> 43:12.858
Yeah. Yeah.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.630
Smells good, right?

43:18.664 --> 43:20.666
Yeah, smells.

43:20.699 --> 43:23.601
But looks, like shit.

43:46.825 --> 43:49.427
You alright, Dad?

43:49.460 --> 43:50.929
Dad?

43:50.962 --> 43:52.798
Your marshmallow's f-ed.

43:52.831 --> 43:55.433
Oh. Oh, well I,

43:55.466 --> 43:57.669
I like them burnt.

44:22.728 --> 44:25.363
There's something out there.

44:27.432 --> 44:29.167
(Twigs snapping)

44:31.502 --> 44:34.672
Yeah dad, I totally think
something's out there.

44:36.875 --> 44:38.777
(Twig snapping)

44:41.813 --> 44:45.050
Whoever's out there
better come out right now

44:45.884 --> 44:48.920
Sorry, sorry, it's just me.

44:48.954 --> 44:51.156
Just Ronnie.

44:51.189 --> 44:54.926
Ronnie, what are you
doing in the woods?

44:55.794 --> 44:59.130
Oh I just saw the fire
and I heard voices, so

45:03.769 --> 45:06.137
Why don't you join us?

45:07.939 --> 45:10.942
Here, have a seat.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.050
Want mine?

45:20.886 --> 45:22.821
No, I'm good.

45:26.792 --> 45:30.896
Oh, sorry, Ronnie, this is
Joe Barnett and his son, Noah.

45:30.929 --> 45:34.332
Joe, Noah, this is
Ronnie, she is the

45:34.900 --> 45:36.768
Caretaker.

45:37.869 --> 45:41.272
Yeah, how did you know that?

45:43.574 --> 45:46.344
When I drove up I
saw her care-taking

45:46.912 --> 45:50.415
Nice to meet you.

45:53.351 --> 45:55.821
Sorry. I have to go.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.791
Okay.

46:02.994 --> 46:06.364
Hippies. Am I right?

46:07.866 --> 46:11.236
Um, I'm going to
call it a night.

46:11.269 --> 46:12.570
Are you okay?

46:12.603 --> 46:14.339
Yeah, I just don't feel good.

46:14.372 --> 46:15.273
Goodnight, Dad.

46:15.306 --> 46:18.376
Goodnight.

46:21.847 --> 46:23.414
Yeah I think your dad's right,

46:23.448 --> 46:24.883
Maybe we should all hit it,

46:24.916 --> 46:27.252
Don't you think?

46:27.285 --> 46:28.586
Fine.

46:28.619 --> 46:31.322
What? What's?

46:31.356 --> 46:33.324
Kids. Bedtime.

46:33.358 --> 46:34.425
Bedtime?

46:34.459 --> 46:35.460
Mom, I'm 18.

46:35.493 --> 46:37.095
I'm an adult.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.164
Yeah, you are.

46:42.934 --> 46:45.503
Uh, 'night.

46:50.141 --> 46:52.610
What's got her
panties in a bunch?

46:52.643 --> 46:55.213
Why don't you ask Ronnie?

46:58.049 --> 47:01.386
Wait for it, wait for it.

47:04.389 --> 47:06.925
Shit.

47:15.400 --> 47:17.035
You're acting crazy right now.

47:17.068 --> 47:20.338
Don't you dare
call me crazy, Jeff!

47:22.607 --> 47:24.642
Can you honestly tell
me nothing's going on

47:24.675 --> 47:27.178
With you and Ronnie?

47:31.950 --> 47:34.419
I cross my heart
and swear to die.

47:34.452 --> 47:37.388
There's nothing going
on between Ronnie and I.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.090
I slipped up once, Bev.

47:39.124 --> 47:40.258
Now every time I look at a woman

47:40.291 --> 47:41.993
You think I'm sleeping with her.

47:42.027 --> 47:44.930
Can you blame me?

47:44.963 --> 47:47.232
Fine. Believe what you want,

47:47.265 --> 47:49.034
I'm going to bed.

47:49.067 --> 47:50.068
Fine.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.202
Fine.

48:16.661 --> 48:19.064
(Door opens)

48:19.998 --> 48:22.400
Chloe?

48:33.611 --> 48:36.447
Chloe?

48:38.183 --> 48:42.153
(Scary music)

49:31.502 --> 49:32.537
(Scream)

49:41.212 --> 49:43.148
(Floor squeaking)

49:43.181 --> 49:44.615
Hello?

49:44.649 --> 49:46.651
(Squeaking)

50:23.421 --> 50:25.523
Hello?

50:26.524 --> 50:29.127
Chloe is that you?

50:29.427 --> 50:31.596
This isn't funny.

50:54.419 --> 50:57.088
Mom are you there?

50:59.624 --> 51:01.126
Mom?

51:07.898 --> 51:10.135
Who is this?

51:15.173 --> 51:17.575
Grandpa?

51:30.755 --> 51:32.823
Danger?

51:32.857 --> 51:35.160
What danger?

51:40.865 --> 51:43.601
What's so dangerous about it?

51:50.608 --> 51:55.146
Oh, okay Grandpa, there's
a demon inside the board.

52:30.248 --> 52:32.450
What are you doing up so late?

52:32.483 --> 52:34.852
I couldn't sleep.

52:35.386 --> 52:37.388
What is that?

52:37.422 --> 52:38.523
Nothing.

52:38.556 --> 52:41.259
Nothing, huh?

52:43.361 --> 52:44.695
Where did you get that?

52:44.729 --> 52:46.364
Was this here?

52:46.397 --> 52:47.398
Tell me!

52:47.432 --> 52:48.533
I found it in
Grandpa's office.

52:48.566 --> 52:49.700
Why did you take it?

52:49.734 --> 52:51.402
I didn't, it was in the car,
I thought you brought it.

52:51.436 --> 52:52.670
Don't lie to me, Noah.

52:52.703 --> 52:54.939
I'm not lying, Dad.

52:57.242 --> 52:58.676
No, no no, please,

52:58.709 --> 53:01.412
How will I talk to
mom or grandpa now?

53:01.446 --> 53:03.414
They're gone.

53:03.448 --> 53:05.550
From here, yeah, but
they're still out there.

53:05.583 --> 53:07.218
Go to your room.

53:07.252 --> 53:08.553
We're leaving first
thing in the morning.

53:08.586 --> 53:09.487
But, Dad?

53:09.520 --> 53:11.356
Go!

53:14.559 --> 53:16.594
Dad, please, I
was talking to her,

53:16.627 --> 53:18.396
You have to believe me.

53:18.429 --> 53:20.865
Enough. This
thing is not real.

53:20.898 --> 53:23.234
Your mother and Dov
are not contacting you.

53:23.268 --> 53:25.002
It's a figment of
your imagination.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.003
Then why do you care?

53:26.036 --> 53:27.405
Cause I'm your father

53:27.438 --> 53:29.274
And you're going to
respect my wishes.

53:29.307 --> 53:31.576
Now get inside and go to bed.

53:31.609 --> 53:34.279
You're an asshole
you know that?

53:45.990 --> 53:48.759
Dude. We're trying to sleep.

53:48.793 --> 53:50.428
Joe.

53:50.461 --> 53:53.298
I'll be out of here
first thing in the morning.

54:07.077 --> 54:10.348
Joe, hey.

54:13.784 --> 54:15.820
Do you want to tell me what's
going on with you and Noah?

54:15.853 --> 54:17.455
No.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.389
Look I'm getting all packed up,

54:18.423 --> 54:20.891
We'll be out of here
before anyone wakes up.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.893
No. Hey.

54:22.927 --> 54:26.331
You don't have to go.

54:26.364 --> 54:27.998
Joe?

54:28.032 --> 54:29.300
We've been friends
almost our whole lives.

54:29.334 --> 54:30.468
Really?

54:30.501 --> 54:31.669
We're friends?

54:31.702 --> 54:33.304
I mean I know we were
neighbors growing up,

54:33.338 --> 54:34.572
But I haven't seen you,

54:34.605 --> 54:35.272
I haven't even spoken
to you in 30 years

54:35.306 --> 54:36.474
And now you think we're friends?

54:36.507 --> 54:37.775
How dare you.

54:37.808 --> 54:39.477
Do you have any idea
how much it hurt

54:39.510 --> 54:41.646
When you sent away
the first time?

54:41.679 --> 54:44.349
You just disappeared.

54:44.382 --> 54:47.452
Now you're going to do it again?

54:54.692 --> 54:56.594
Look, I'm sorry.

54:56.627 --> 55:00.398
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

55:08.406 --> 55:12.577
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

55:14.912 --> 55:16.847
Yeah.

55:17.682 --> 55:20.751
We should sit.

55:40.405 --> 55:44.375
Hey, everybody knows those
Ouija boards aren't real.

55:44.409 --> 55:46.844
Come on, it's a kids toy.

55:46.877 --> 55:50.381
Maybe, maybe Noah's
going through a difficult

55:50.415 --> 55:52.383
Time in his life right now,

55:52.417 --> 55:55.386
And you know he needs
someone to talk to.

55:55.420 --> 55:57.988
He's about to graduate
high school this year

55:58.022 --> 56:01.025
And that's sometimes
difficult to process.

56:01.058 --> 56:03.027
Even home.

56:03.561 --> 56:05.530
The night Max and
his family were killed,

56:05.563 --> 56:06.664
You don't have
to talk about it.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.933
No, Bev. Bev.

56:08.966 --> 56:13.971
It's, why can't I remember
what happened that night?

56:14.505 --> 56:17.174
Ever since I've been
here I've having snippets

56:17.207 --> 56:18.709
Of that night.

56:18.743 --> 56:20.711
Little bits and pieces
are coming back to me

56:20.745 --> 56:23.481
But it just doesn't
make any sense.

56:23.514 --> 56:24.715
I wish I could help.

56:24.749 --> 56:26.517
You can.

56:26.551 --> 56:28.419
Can you tell me anything
from that night?

56:28.453 --> 56:31.556
Anything you may have heard?

56:31.589 --> 56:34.759
Yossi, the things were heard

56:34.792 --> 56:36.861
They were just rumors.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.429
Can you tell me?

56:38.463 --> 56:39.797
Please?

56:39.830 --> 56:41.065
All I've ever been
told about that night

56:41.098 --> 56:42.500
Is that I was in some
sort of accident.

56:42.533 --> 56:45.102
That's it.

56:46.537 --> 56:49.774
That's not what we heard.

56:51.609 --> 56:54.579
Bev, what did you hear?

56:54.612 --> 56:55.480
We,

56:58.616 --> 57:00.685
We heard you,

57:06.624 --> 57:08.459
We heard you lost
it or something

57:08.493 --> 57:11.462
And you killed Max
and his family.

57:12.196 --> 57:14.532
And when the police
showed up at your house

57:14.565 --> 57:17.768
They found your dad
drowning you in the bathtub.

57:21.138 --> 57:23.608
Your dad didn't send you away,

57:23.641 --> 57:26.844
The state did.

57:28.145 --> 57:30.648
If that's true then how
come my father wasn't arrested?

57:30.681 --> 57:32.650
How come I didn't grow
up in juvenile detention?

57:32.683 --> 57:34.585
I told you, they
were just rumors.

57:34.619 --> 57:37.655
Yeah, well all rumors are
based on some sort of truth.

57:37.688 --> 57:40.190
Look, this board isn't
going to be bringing

57:40.224 --> 57:42.527
Back any more
bad memories okay?

57:42.560 --> 57:45.996
You threw it in the
trash, it's done.

57:46.030 --> 57:48.533
Right?

57:49.667 --> 57:52.570
Out of sight, out of mind?

57:54.839 --> 57:58.776
Come on, get some sleep.

57:58.809 --> 58:01.546
Let's have fun this weekend,
okay?

58:05.550 --> 58:09.520
Yeah, you're right.

58:10.588 --> 58:12.256
You're right.

58:13.558 --> 58:16.493
Always.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.565
'Night.

58:25.235 --> 58:27.605
'Night.

58:52.262 --> 58:55.733
The church will look
after him as long as he can.

58:55.766 --> 58:59.637
Whatever you do, do not
let him come back here

58:59.670 --> 59:01.038
Until I figure out
how to dispose of it.

59:01.071 --> 59:02.773
I promise.

59:02.807 --> 59:04.742
But as soon as he's of age,

59:04.775 --> 59:07.344
I can't stop him
from seeking answers.

59:07.377 --> 59:10.748
I understand.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.584
I just hope it doesn't
take me that long

59:13.618 --> 59:15.986
To finish this.

59:16.654 --> 59:20.290
Yousef? Yousef?

59:22.292 --> 59:25.996
What happened to his eyes?

59:27.665 --> 59:31.702
Matthew 6, verse 22 and 23.

59:31.936 --> 59:35.339
The eye is the lamp of the body.

59:35.773 --> 59:40.611
And if the eye is light
he'll be full of light

59:40.645 --> 59:44.615
But if the eye is bad then
it'll be full of darkness.

59:47.084 --> 59:49.319
Can you fix it?

59:49.353 --> 59:51.321
I don't know.

59:51.355 --> 59:53.824
But we'll try.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.782
Hey, Chloe.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:25.890
Noah?

01:00:28.693 --> 01:00:30.394
Noah?

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.730
Joe, what's wrong?

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.164
Noah brought that
board back in the house,

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:35.800
Do you know where he is?

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:37.167
I think he went for
a walk down the hill.

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:38.368
Okay.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.350
Noah!

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.852
What is wrong with you?

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:55.720
What are you talking about?

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:56.987
I didn't do anything.

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:58.322
You know what you did.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:59.757
You took the Ouija
board out of the trash

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:00.725
And you brought it
back in the house.

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:01.558
No I didn't.

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.460
Then how'd it get
back inside, huh?

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.295
You know, you're about
to go to college buddy.

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:06.864
It's time you start
acting like a man

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.699
And admitting when you
did something wrong.

01:01:08.733 --> 01:01:10.467
Dad, I'm telling
you, it wasn't me.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.702
Then it didn't
just jump up and

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:13.037
Go inside by itself.

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.740
Maybe it did.

01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:17.307
What did you just say to me?

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.744
Maybe it did move by itself.

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:21.846
I know you don't believe
me, but it moved.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:23.347
And I did talk to
Mom and Grandpa,

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.049
A few times actually.

01:01:25.082 --> 01:01:26.751
It's called a spirit board, Dad.

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:28.986
That's what it's made
for, to talk to the dead.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.988
Maybe there's a reason
we're not supposed

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.023
To talk to the dead.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.760
Don't you start playing
with this stuff, buddy,

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:37.427
Your grandfather messed
around with this,

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:39.830
And look how he turned out.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:42.800
Dad, wait.

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:58.048
Look, I'm not really
in the mood for

01:01:58.082 --> 01:02:02.386
You to call me a creep or
a pervert or whatever, okay?

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.483
I'm sorry.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:40.357
About everything.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.462
It's just, I don't know

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.933
I guess I'm still processing
how my mom could move on

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:51.535
So fast after my dad died.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:55.539
Especially with a guy like Jeff.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:59.276
I don't know, maybe
it's better than never

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:01.846
Moving on at all.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:04.849
At least you have
your freedom, right?

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:08.152
You'll have it soon.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:10.821
You're going away
to school, right?

01:03:10.855 --> 01:03:13.590
Yeah.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.325
Part of me can't wait to
get the hell out of here

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.994
And live my own life.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:20.030
But the other part of me can't
just leave him by himself.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.503
Can I ask you a question?

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.439
Sure, I'll go
to prom with you.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:30.941
I'm serious.

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.542
Sorry.

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.845
Sure.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:40.417
Did you really talk to
your mom and granddad?

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:43.520
You're going to
tell me I'm crazy too.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:44.855
No.

01:03:44.889 --> 01:03:47.091
I'm serious.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.531
I want to talk to my dad.

01:03:57.902 --> 01:03:59.369
I'd better not.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:00.971
You saw my dad,
he's pissed as is,

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.372
What do you think he would do

01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:03.207
If I got you involved?

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.843
Look, you saw me
naked so you owe me.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:10.847
Okay.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:13.984
But we have to do it
after everyone's asleep.

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:15.920
Okay.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:20.290
Thanks.

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:47.884
(Scary music)

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.454
Yousef! Run!

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:51.655
(Yelling)

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:09.940
Dad, are you okay?

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:11.575
Where am I?

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:14.044
We found you on
the ground twitching.

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:17.414
I'm so sorry, for everything.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:20.650
Let's not go saying something
we can't take back now

01:05:21.318 --> 01:05:22.919
Thank you.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:25.990
This is, uh, your place?

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.557
Ronnie's a certified EMT.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.093
And a shaman.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:31.261
I thought shamans were men.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:33.130
It's a long story.

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.499
Bev was telling me
about that night

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:37.167
When you were younger?

01:05:37.201 --> 01:05:39.269
Yeah.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:42.639
All I remember is my father
drowning me in a bathtub

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.475
Although it wasn't me.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:49.413
I was seeing through
someone else's eyes.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:53.117
In fact, all of that
just came back to me

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.986
When I touched that board.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.254
What board?

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.656
The Ouija board.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:03.027
You have a Ouija
board back at the house?

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.996
Has anyone else used it?

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.435
It's okay, I followed
all the rules.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.437
The Ouija board has rules?

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.472
Yes, as well as being
a conduit for spirits,

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:18.575
Spirit boards can also
be containment units.

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.111
Wait wait wait,
so you can contact

01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:23.480
The dead and you can what?

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:25.515
Trap them in the board?

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:27.784
Yes. But as long as
no one else used it,

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.187
And Noah obeyed
all of the rules,

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.688
Then we should be fine.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:35.092
Noah, what did you do?

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.393
I play alone.

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:37.727
You, what?

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:40.630
It's okay, I said goodbye,
we should be fine, right?

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.199
As long as Noah
said goodbye then

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:44.401
The spirit can't
escape, but it can still

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:46.803
Have influence and
try to find a way out.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:49.406
This could explain your visions.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:52.342
What happens if it gets out?

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:54.578
Possession.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.180
Death.

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:57.714
Destruction.

01:06:57.747 --> 01:07:01.118
Well, at least it
isn't something bad.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:03.520
So, as long as no one
else plays with the board

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:05.089
We can get rid of it, right?

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:06.723
In the simplest way, yes,

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.758
But I need to unlock
Joe's memories

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.727
And see if there's
anything that can help us.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.496
You can do that?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.199
You can unblock my memories?

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:17.234
I know a way, yes.

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.769
But it can be quite painful.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.709
Do it.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.744
Are you sure?

01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:32.048
Yeah.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:42.259
Close your eyes
and breathe it in.

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:46.530
These fragmented
memories you're having

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.433
Could be the result of
a memory block spell.

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.368
Like some amnesia spell?

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.736
Come on, my father
wasn't some sort of

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.371
Rabbinical wizard.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.840
Eyes closed and relax.

01:07:58.142 --> 01:08:00.244
There are many hasidic
Jews who are well

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:02.546
Versed in mysticism
and the dark arts.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.248
If your father didn't
want you to remember

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:05.582
These horrible things,

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:08.352
It's possible he
performed a memory block.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:12.489
I need complete silence.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:42.551
Yousef? Yousef?

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:08.712
- Belial.
- Belial.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:10.647
What happened?

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.183
What did you see?

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:15.519
My father.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.189
I was possessed.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:24.294
I killed Max's dad.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:29.198
I mean it did, when it
hopped from him to me.

01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:31.401
It's not your fault.

01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:33.937
You saw, right?

01:09:43.447 --> 01:09:46.350
Belial, the wicked,
the worthless, one of the

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:48.718
Four crowns of hell.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.455
We need the board.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.542
Leave the lights on.

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:14.378
Sick.

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:17.213
I used to have one of
these when I was a kid.

01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:22.719
Is Joe trying to
do my girlfriend?

01:10:23.453 --> 01:10:24.688
Where do you
think you're going?

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:26.256
To get the board.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:27.457
And Chloe.

01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:28.858
When I said you
needed to start acting

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:30.627
Like a man, I didn't mean now.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.696
Better late than never, huh?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.798
Look, Dad, I'll be fine.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:36.666
Trust me.

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:40.470
Noah.

01:10:40.504 --> 01:10:42.939
Bring Chloe back safe.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.776
Does Ronnie like
it in the...

01:10:49.313 --> 01:10:51.515
It's broken anyway.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.520
Refill!

01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:03.993
(Scary music)

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:43.867
(Growling)

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:02.886
(Door slams)

01:12:09.393 --> 01:12:11.060
I need candles.

01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:12.396
They're in the back.

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.564
Okay, I'll get some.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.638
I can't leave my
son out there alone.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.441
I have to go find him.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:10.186
Jeff, now is not a good time.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.622
Bev's here.

01:13:12.656 --> 01:13:15.759
Bev, Jeff is here!

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.128
Where are Noah and Joe,
did they get the board?

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:22.398
Jeff?

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:27.471
Jeff's not here.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:29.839
Belial.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:46.823
Ronnie, I found
these will they...

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:51.160
Jeff, what the
hell are you doing?

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.633
Even better.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.668
(Screaming)

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:11.481
Bev-er-ly.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.719
No, what the hell, get off me.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:20.557
Told you, I got it.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.792
Will one of you weirdos
tell me what's going on?

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.494
There's no time to explain.

01:14:24.528 --> 01:14:26.663
It's not safe out here, come on!

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:31.668
(Dramatic music)

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:44.581
Bev-er-ly!

01:14:58.562 --> 01:15:01.631
Bev-er-ly!

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.009
What the hell happened here?

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:15.612
It's us!

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.777
(Growling)

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.593
I'm alive, thank God.

01:16:03.627 --> 01:16:04.894
I'm alive, okay.

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:06.596
I'm alive.

01:16:08.632 --> 01:16:10.967
Don't thank him
just yet, cheater.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:15.238
Bev, I know I'm a cheater,
just, please don't kill me.

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:16.272
Please don't kill me.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.776
You broke my heart, Jeffrey.

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:21.811
I'm so sorry, Bev.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.649
What's that old saying?

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:28.584
An eye for an eye?

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:37.894
And a heart for a heart.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.963
Quick, get inside the circle.

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:41.330
Why?

01:16:41.364 --> 01:16:43.767
Because spirits
can't pass the line.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:47.837
We are in big trouble.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.106
It is out.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.075
What do you mean it's out?

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:56.612
Belial. Belial is out,
and it's taken hold of Jeff.

01:16:57.313 --> 01:16:58.414
Like possession?

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.348
Yes.

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:01.017
What do we do?

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:04.020
We need to get
Jeff into water.

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:06.089
The pool.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.657
We need to lure
him into the pool

01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:09.693
And you can exorcise him.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:10.794
What? Me?

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.328
Why me? You're the shaman.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.830
I don't read Hebrew.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:14.831
I haven't read
Hebrew in 30 years.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:16.700
You'll be fine, I hear
it's like riding a bike.

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:18.134
Yeah, it's just
like riding a bike.

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:19.368
Alright, screw this,
I'm finding my mom.

01:17:19.402 --> 01:17:21.905
No, stay, close.

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:25.008
You can't pass the line.

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:28.344
(Growling)

01:17:31.414 --> 01:17:34.650
God dammit, Jeff
what do you want?

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:37.721
Yousef?

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.022
Mom?

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:40.824
Get off of me you dirty
hippie, I need my mom.

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:42.692
That's not your mom.

01:17:42.726 --> 01:17:45.028
It's okay, we'll save
her, I promise.

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:48.732
I'm not the one who
needs saving, bitch.

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:51.801
You slept with my boyfriend

01:17:51.835 --> 01:17:54.938
And I won't stop till
I rip you to shreds.

01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:58.007
(Growling)

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:08.451
Give me back my son
you piece of shit!

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:11.988
I have to help him.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:13.890
Wait, it wants you.

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:15.391
Then why didn't it take me?

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:16.359
Why did it take
everybody but me,

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:18.261
Why did it take Noah?

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:21.731
It wants to make you suffer
before it possesses you again.

01:18:21.765 --> 01:18:24.133
Wait!

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:30.506
Psalm 91, read the
verse and you can

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.108
Exorcise the demon,

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:33.743
But make sure you
are both in the water

01:18:33.777 --> 01:18:35.745
Before you finish the Psalm.

01:18:35.779 --> 01:18:37.413
Okay.

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:42.852
It can't hurt.

01:18:44.788 --> 01:18:47.056
Like riding a bike, huh?

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:51.795
Joe?

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:53.763
Have faith.

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.825
(Reading in Hebrew)

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.516
(Screaming)

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:54.057
Bev?

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.163
Beverly?

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:02.165
Beverly?

01:20:05.869 --> 01:20:07.871
I'm so sorry.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:09.372
I'm so sorry.

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:12.341
(Laughter)

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:28.391
(Reading in Hebrew)

01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:40.536
(Screaming)

01:21:12.969 --> 01:21:15.038
(Laughter)

01:21:15.071 --> 01:21:18.307
You can't save her, just like
you couldn't save your wife.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.956
That's where you're wrong.

01:21:33.456 --> 01:21:35.091
Heart will befall you.

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:37.060
Heart will befall all of you.

01:21:37.293 --> 01:21:38.294
Noah.

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:40.429
Noah isn't here, only Belial.

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:46.135
Sorry, the book wasn't
working fast enough.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.249
It's not working, Ronnie.

01:22:00.283 --> 01:22:01.550
Fight it to hold on,

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:04.220
The harder you try it
more it tears Noah apart

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:07.090
Before it moves on to you.

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:10.559
Then let's give
it what it wants.

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:12.461
Joe, no!

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:15.031
It's the only way.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:18.167
Okay. Chloe!

01:22:19.102 --> 01:22:21.004
Chloe, help!

01:22:21.037 --> 01:22:23.006
I need my bag, Chloe!

01:22:42.025 --> 01:22:44.693
I will haunt you and
your family for eternity

01:22:44.727 --> 01:22:47.563
Until nothing is left
but rotting flesh.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:54.370
Joe, are you sure?

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:56.705
We can still try to
trap it in the board.

01:22:56.739 --> 01:22:58.174
No I don't want to trap it,

01:22:58.207 --> 01:22:59.275
I want it gone forever,

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.676
That's what my
father couldn't do.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:04.047
Because it's a mortal sin
to try to take one's own life.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:05.648
Don't you care about that?

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:07.283
Are you willing to die?

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.553
If it saves my son, yes.

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:13.056
When it's done, do it.

01:23:13.089 --> 01:23:15.491
Don't hesitate, okay?

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:21.097
We beseech you,

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:22.565
Release this boy,

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:24.300
We beseech you,

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.135
We beseech you,
release this boy,

01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:27.236
Leave this boy,

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:29.205
Leave this boy,

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:30.339
We beseech you.

01:23:46.555 --> 01:23:49.392
I'm going to take
my time and enjoy it.

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:03.706
Dad?

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.244
Dad?

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.513
Dad?

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:11.747
I'm sorry.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:17.780
