00:09.537 --> 00:11.872
Sheriff Wat-Senn!
Come quick!

00:11.907 --> 00:14.875
What is it this time?
Another Muroid stuck in a well?

00:14.910 --> 00:16.732
A crime in progress!

See?

00:33.353 --> 00:37.126
Rook Shar, watch me
kick in the space drive!

00:37.161 --> 00:39.897
Looks to me like your brother's
getting pretty good at that.

00:39.932 --> 00:43.202
Young one has broken several
laws ... reckless endangerment,

00:43.237 --> 00:47.407
crop destruction...
being a brat. Go after him.

00:47.443 --> 00:51.381
A Plumber's best course of
action is not to get involved.

00:51.416 --> 00:54.881
Let it happen around you,
not to you.

01:00.457 --> 01:04.592
It needs adjustment.
- You are not going to cuff him?

01:05.328 --> 01:07.461
Nothing ever happens here.

01:07.496 --> 01:10.929
Which is why I asked to
be stationed on Revonnah.

01:10.964 --> 01:14.166
Now, if that is all, I got
a piece of pie to get back to.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.707
The alien craft
should be just ahead.

01:53.742 --> 01:55.709
Any idea where it's from?

01:58.380 --> 02:02.215
It does not move
like any ship I've seen.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.651
What kind of wacky flying is that?

02:04.687 --> 02:08.455
<i>Extremely wacky flying.
What do you suppose it signifies?</i>

02:08.490 --> 02:13.292
A wacky pilot?
- Or perhaps an injured one.

02:23.303 --> 02:25.538
Time to take this guy for a spin.

02:26.775 --> 02:30.177
Be careful, Ben. I detect
no onboard communications.

02:30.212 --> 02:32.312
Maybe he just needs help landing.

02:32.348 --> 02:36.583
<i>You have breached
Earth airspace. Pull over.</i>

02:40.556 --> 02:41.589
Huh?

02:41.624 --> 02:44.725
Ha! Too slow!
Uh-oh.

02:54.536 --> 02:57.873
Young one? Is that you?

02:58.408 --> 03:00.375
When did you learn to pilot a ship?

03:00.410 --> 03:03.979
Oh, while you were away.
Ben 10!

03:05.815 --> 03:10.286
Does father know what
you have done to this harvester?

03:10.621 --> 03:13.055
Revonnah has been
invaded! You must help!

03:13.090 --> 03:16.425
An invasion?
Our family, a-are they ...

03:16.460 --> 03:20.095
I do not know. I went to find you
and Ben 10 as soon as it happened.

03:20.130 --> 03:23.231
You are quite brave,
little brother. Ben?

03:23.267 --> 03:25.100
Do you even have to ask?

03:26.869 --> 03:30.472
<i>It is time we
proceed with our test run.</i>

03:30.508 --> 03:34.876
Hey! Psychobos!
- Dr. Psychobos.

03:34.911 --> 03:38.279
Don't flash your credentials
at me. This gonna work or what?

03:38.315 --> 03:43.217
So far, the trials are
going along swimmingly, Princess Attea.

03:43.252 --> 03:48.622
Now I just need to synthesize enough
from that amber c-c-concentrate.

03:48.658 --> 03:49.990
Have faith.

03:50.026 --> 03:52.359
Faith? How 'bout,
you blow this, and I

03:52.394 --> 03:55.262
crack your shell open just like
I did that jail cell you were

03:55.297 --> 03:58.683
rotting in and I have
that big brain served up

03:58.684 --> 04:02.069
to me with drawn butter
and a teeny-weeny fork?

04:02.672 --> 04:06.054
Watch your frog tongue, your highness.

04:06.055 --> 04:08.309
I am not without resources.

04:11.715 --> 04:15.383
Try me.
Better yet, do your job!

04:16.619 --> 04:21.857
I will ... provided
you do your job as "leader."

04:21.892 --> 04:27.563
And I use the term loosely. Bring
me all the amber Ogia you can.

04:27.599 --> 04:31.634
Whatever, crab puff.
I get the berries, you make the

04:31.669 --> 04:34.003
formula, and we leave this dump.

04:34.038 --> 04:38.007
Oh. And I use the term loosely.

04:48.918 --> 04:51.620
Wait till I tell everyone
back home that I was in

04:51.656 --> 04:53.856
a high-speed chase with
the legendary Ben 10!

04:53.891 --> 04:56.158
More like a high-speed crash.

04:57.561 --> 05:00.796
It only took one small repair.
Thank you, Ben, for the loan of

05:00.831 --> 05:02.898
your ... what do you
call that component?

05:02.933 --> 05:04.834
Wire coat hanger?
- Yes.

05:04.869 --> 05:08.071
<i>I had to fabricate many parts
to equip the space drive.</i>

05:08.106 --> 05:09.672
<i>This is part of a rake.</i>

05:09.708 --> 05:12.208
<i>Have you made a starship
engine out of farm tools?</i>

05:12.243 --> 05:14.410
<i>Many eating utensils were used, as well.</i>

05:14.445 --> 05:17.346
When did you learn to
build such advanced devices?

05:17.382 --> 05:19.081
While you were away.

05:19.116 --> 05:22.284
Rook, isn't this where you
tell me we need to wait for backup?

05:22.320 --> 05:26.355
The Incurseans are targeting
Plumber ships, including my own.

05:26.390 --> 05:27.823
This harvester may be the best

05:27.859 --> 05:30.126
vessel that we can take
into Incursean space.

05:30.161 --> 05:32.295
We could have called Rad Dudesman.

05:32.330 --> 05:35.398
I am not worried. We have
the great Ben 10 on our side.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.566
The invaders are as good as gone.

05:37.602 --> 05:41.837
Young one, look, "planetary
invasion" is an awfully big word.

05:41.872 --> 05:44.139
Actually, it is two words.

05:44.174 --> 05:46.374
Yeah ... both big.

05:46.409 --> 05:48.409
The Incurseans have
been on a tear lately.

05:48.444 --> 05:50.744
By now, anything could have happened.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.079
<i>Ben is right.</i>

05:52.115 --> 05:55.683
<i>I fear that our people may
not fare well in an invasion.</i>

06:06.028 --> 06:07.929
What invasion?

06:21.524 --> 06:23.425
There was an explosion right there.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.561
The harvester skimmed
right by it when I left.

06:30.799 --> 06:33.067
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.336
Are you sure it was
not just construction?

06:35.371 --> 06:37.471
There has not been any construction.

06:37.506 --> 06:40.774
Then when did
they build that pipeline?

06:43.610 --> 06:45.444
That is new.

07:04.030 --> 07:06.131
Is everyone all right?

07:06.166 --> 07:09.534
Rook Blonko? Pray tell,
what are you doing here?

07:09.570 --> 07:11.903
We heard there was trouble.

07:11.938 --> 07:15.740
Trouble? No, no, everything's
precisely as it should be.

07:15.776 --> 07:19.244
We're harvesting at a tremendous rate.

07:22.715 --> 07:26.617
A this time of year?
- Young one, you scamp.

07:26.653 --> 07:29.688
How did you manage to
contact your brother?

07:29.723 --> 07:32.691
Are you... certain all is well?

07:32.726 --> 07:36.061
Of course. Don't
be an imb-b-ecile.

07:36.096 --> 07:41.166
Come eat your dinner.
You too, Ben T-Tennyson.

07:41.201 --> 07:44.202
Are you sure I'm
welcome after last time?

07:44.237 --> 07:48.340
You'll join us, Tennyson.
I insist.

07:58.018 --> 08:02.188
Where is the rest of the food?
The drinks, salads, pies?

08:02.223 --> 08:05.558
Obviously, we found that
we can get by on less.

08:05.594 --> 08:09.262
This surprises me.
Father, you taught me that

08:09.297 --> 08:12.099
a Revonnahgander's
nutritional needs are ...

08:12.134 --> 08:16.903
Now, Rook Blonko, I don't wish
to hear your dimwitted theories.

08:23.978 --> 08:27.881
You Plumbers are just
like your precious Galvans.

08:27.916 --> 08:30.918
You think you're so smart.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.288
Galvans are stupid.

08:37.958 --> 08:40.861
Rook Da used
contractions when he spoke.

08:40.897 --> 08:42.429
Yes ... several.

08:42.465 --> 08:46.200
Most shameful to hear that
sort of talk from our father.

08:46.236 --> 08:50.037
Something's way off,
and it isn't the grammar.

08:50.073 --> 08:53.107
Father, when was
the new pipeline built?

08:59.048 --> 09:04.484
It's brand-new. We're sending the amber
Ogia to a new p-processing facility.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.757
So, you're fine with
your son being a Plumber?

09:09.792 --> 09:13.093
What? Who cares about that?
It's inconsequential.

09:13.129 --> 09:16.197
Did the Incurseans
invade Revonnah or not?

09:22.404 --> 09:24.238
Incurseans? You're a fool.

09:24.273 --> 09:28.042
The Incurseans don't have a thing
to do with our little planet.

09:28.077 --> 09:32.947
Maybe we should go check
out the rest of the place.

09:32.982 --> 09:35.717
Nonsense.
- Excuse us.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.790
Do you believe me or not?
- Yeah.

09:42.826 --> 09:44.992
These aren't the people I met before.

09:45.028 --> 09:47.762
Father is not himself.
None of them are.

09:47.798 --> 09:51.132
If young one is right, then
the Incurseans are behind this.

09:51.167 --> 09:54.102
<i>So, then, where are the frogs?</i>

09:54.137 --> 09:56.070
<i>And where is Rook Shar?</i>

09:58.074 --> 10:00.812
Probably just a Muroid.

10:06.971 --> 10:09.550
Muroids, huh?

10:29.608 --> 10:31.274
Ben, come on.

10:42.221 --> 10:43.821
Got to even the playing field.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.595
What alien is that?
- Ballweevil.

10:50.630 --> 10:53.798
He rolls material into his
plasma ball until it gets very

10:53.834 --> 10:57.969
large, then blows it up.
- Unthinkable!

11:02.775 --> 11:04.609
Idiot human!

11:58.798 --> 12:00.031
Boy, am I glad it's you.

12:00.066 --> 12:03.569
We have very little time
before they catch up to us.

12:15.881 --> 12:19.483
Not to worry ... Muroids are
timid, unintelligent creatures.

12:19.519 --> 12:22.986
Not this time, Blonko.
- Excuse me?

12:25.623 --> 12:32.462
Rook Shar! Something is
going on with the neighbors.

12:32.497 --> 12:35.498
We know. We went underground
as soon as you left.

12:35.534 --> 12:37.901
I wanted to stay above ground and fight.

12:37.936 --> 12:40.569
You'd have been lost ...
like the rest of them.

12:40.605 --> 12:43.472
We believe that the
Incurseans have all of Revonnah

12:43.508 --> 12:46.108
under some sort of...
mind control.

12:46.143 --> 12:50.112
I should have never gone to
Earth. I could have done something.

12:50.147 --> 12:53.214
You'd have been lucky to
make it underground, like us.

12:53.249 --> 12:55.950
We'd have done fine.
I'm Ben Tennyson.

12:55.985 --> 12:57.585
Yeah, I know who you are.

12:57.620 --> 13:01.089
They were spraying something
in the fields, then all at once,

13:01.124 --> 13:05.694
Revonnah stopped resisting ...
like somebody threw a switch.

13:05.729 --> 13:08.562
And the Revonnahganders have
been harvesting amber Ogia ever

13:08.598 --> 13:11.699
since, sending it straight through
the pipeline to the Incurseans.

13:11.734 --> 13:14.200
This why there was hardly
any food on the table.

13:14.235 --> 13:17.568
It's all going into the pipeline.
- By now, the Incurseans

13:17.603 --> 13:21.305
have enough fuel for 100 fleets,
and the pipeline is still flowing.

13:21.340 --> 13:23.006
They why don't they leave?

13:23.042 --> 13:26.176
What could they possibly be
doing with all that amber Ogia?

13:55.406 --> 13:59.276
With a few buckets
of modified Ogia concentrate,

13:59.311 --> 14:04.347
<i>plus my amazing amplification
device, we will soon be able to</i>

14:04.383 --> 14:08.385
<i>control the minds ... and
I use the term loosely ...</i>

14:08.386 --> 14:13.624
<i>- of everyone in the galaxy.
- Looks good, Psycho boy.</i>

14:13.659 --> 14:17.761
Dr. Psycho boy!
Uh, "Psychobos."

14:17.796 --> 14:22.899
A few trillion mind-control drones ...
now we're getting somewhere.

14:22.935 --> 14:26.303
You mind-control every last yutz
on every last planet like you

14:26.338 --> 14:31.374
did here, and I'll make you
the richest crab in the galaxy.

14:31.410 --> 14:36.614
That won't be
necessary, you vulgar brat.

14:38.417 --> 14:41.919
Forgive me, General Attea,
Princess scion and teen supreme

14:41.955 --> 14:43.888
of the deathless Incursean Empire!

14:45.424 --> 14:48.993
Keep trying, Psycho boy!

14:50.396 --> 14:52.496
<i>Be gone, Muroids!</i>

15:07.677 --> 15:10.479
The pipeline heads out
to those vats. Wait here.

15:10.514 --> 15:14.183
We have been on this
case the whole time.

15:14.218 --> 15:17.620
So we have better knowledge
of what's been going on.

15:24.528 --> 15:26.429
Are you all right, Rook Shar?

15:26.465 --> 15:29.366
Is that what the Incurseans
sprayed in the fields?

15:29.401 --> 15:32.736
What? You're a fool.

15:32.771 --> 15:36.996
The Incurseans don't have a thing
to do with our little planet ...

15:36.997 --> 15:39.109
and I use the term loosely.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.545
Why are they
mind-controlled but we aren't?

15:48.581 --> 15:51.148
That stuff they were
sprayed with must make them

15:51.183 --> 15:52.983
responsive to the mind-control weapon.

15:53.019 --> 15:56.354
What mind-control weapon?
- I'm coming to that.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.523
Well, get to it while I...

16:03.863 --> 16:06.131
Aw, man!

16:07.201 --> 16:09.167
I apologize, sister.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.106
Ben? Any time now.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.009
<i>Ups-a-daisy!</i>

16:18.044 --> 16:19.878
Ben, take this easy.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.596
Young one, stay with them.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.966
Where are you going?
- The end of the line.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.418
This it?
- Yes.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.621
This weapon must be the origin
of the mind-control signa...

17:03.656 --> 17:06.256
Paws off, Revonnahgander!

17:06.291 --> 17:10.461
Attea!
- You call me "highest commander."

17:10.496 --> 17:12.128
Not likely.

17:14.934 --> 17:15.398
Hey!

17:15.434 --> 17:21.037
I doubt she is the sole
mastermind. And I use the term loosely.

17:21.073 --> 17:23.707
Oh, yeah!
Dr. Psychobos!

17:27.645 --> 17:30.981
<i>Dullards!
It took you long enough!</i>

17:38.125 --> 17:39.658
All right!

17:40.261 --> 17:44.663
I always wanted to be one of
these, uhh... whatever they are.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.560
Energy whippy deals, too?

18:15.997 --> 18:17.830
I'm so there.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.010
<i>My work!</i>

18:39.519 --> 18:43.921
Nice try, blue boy!
- I think Ben had the right idea.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.830
No! Mine!

18:52.867 --> 18:56.636
Not so tough
now, are ya, beakface?

18:56.671 --> 19:00.340
That's handy.
Handy... ish.

19:17.593 --> 19:19.626
Where did this pipeline come from?

19:19.661 --> 19:23.063
And where have all our crops gone?

19:25.067 --> 19:26.600
Young one, help us.

19:26.635 --> 19:30.070
How do I know you are
not still mind-controlled?

19:30.105 --> 19:33.340
Do it, brat.
Or I shall tell mother.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.175
Shar, you're back!
- Language!

19:35.210 --> 19:37.043
Forgive the contraction.

19:39.146 --> 19:45.151
You hurt my family, my
planet, our way of life! No more!

19:45.187 --> 19:47.353
The super-concentrate!

19:51.191 --> 19:55.561
I'll take that!
Probably ought to get lost, Tennyson.

19:55.596 --> 19:59.698
This dull little farm planet
and everyone on it is doomed.

19:59.733 --> 20:01.232
<i>See ya 'round!</i>

20:03.602 --> 20:05.403
We must join in the defense.

20:05.438 --> 20:09.807
Remember ... let it happen
around you, not to you.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.411
Halt! Freeze!

20:20.153 --> 20:21.819
Not bad, Sheriff.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.862
I will stay here
and fight beside you.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.966
No. You must go back to Earth.
We are in control of our thoughts.

20:34.967 --> 20:38.235
We can take care of ourselves.
- But, father ...

20:38.270 --> 20:41.705
Revonnah is one small part
of a war. Go back to Earth.

20:41.740 --> 20:45.575
Find out what the Incurseans
are really after and stop them.

20:45.610 --> 20:49.979
Your dad's right. The frogs'
next move is gonna be someplace else.

20:50.015 --> 20:54.451
Rook Blonko, you have
accomplished so much off-world.

20:54.486 --> 20:59.088
I am proud of you. Why do you think
Rook Shar wants to be a Plumber?

20:59.124 --> 21:02.392
Shar! You do?
- Uh, yeah!

21:02.427 --> 21:07.830
And why do you think young
one wants to visit the stars?

21:07.866 --> 21:11.167
You have become a hero
while you were away.

21:18.008 --> 21:20.843
Ben.
- We'll stop them.

21:20.879 --> 21:24.614
Yes. I was thinking ... if
you wrote a recommendation for Rook

21:24.615 --> 21:28.350
Shar to attend the Plumbers academy,
it would assure her a place ...

21:29.587 --> 21:31.754
<i>When do you need it by?</i>

21:33.656 --> 21:37.025
This is all that's left
of your mind-control juice.

21:37.060 --> 21:41.462
Highest commander,
you must be devastated.

21:42.899 --> 21:44.599
What do you know about it?!

21:44.634 --> 21:49.237
It may not be enough to control
a planet, but it's definitely enough.

21:49.272 --> 21:51.005
Plot a course to Earth!

21:51.006 --> 21:52.106
