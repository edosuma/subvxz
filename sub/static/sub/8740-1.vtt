00:54.300 --> 00:55.699
- There you go.
- Thanks.

01:11.220 --> 01:12.892
I'm gonna be a dad!

01:13.100 --> 01:16.172
I just talked to my wife.
My baby's gonna be delivered any minute.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.979
- Hey, get out of the way.
- Hey, I'm gonna be a dad.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.854
Congratulate me.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.016
Good for you, Herb.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.818
Don't even think about it.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.774
Hey!

01:32.580 --> 01:35.140
Sorry. How are you?
Nice to see you. I'm gonna be a dad!

01:35.340 --> 01:36.853
Congrats!

01:37.980 --> 01:39.857
Hey, Mr. Nuts,
did you hear the news?

01:40.020 --> 01:41.612
- Yeah.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:43.580 --> 01:45.457
I'm here. I'm here.

01:45.860 --> 01:48.738
- I'm here.
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.618
You missed the delivery.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.369
It's okay.
Making the baby's the fun part.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.056
Honey, I think
you've got the wrong...

02:17.740 --> 02:20.618
No, I don't need to see the directions.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.098
Push, push.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.813
Push!

02:50.980 --> 02:53.210
Twelve hours of labor.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.138
Oh, but it was worth it.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.416
Look at him. Look at him.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.895
Rodney Copperbottom.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.455
He's got your mom's eyes
and my dad's nose.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.850
I knew we were smart
to save those parts.

03:05.020 --> 03:08.137
This Copperbottom will do great things
for the world, I can feel it.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.574
- Honey?
- What?

03:09.740 --> 03:11.731
What's that extra piece?

03:12.140 --> 03:15.132
Oh, no, they always put in an extra...

03:16.020 --> 03:17.931
We did want a boy, right?

03:20.740 --> 03:22.856
This won't hurt a bit, son.

03:30.180 --> 03:31.977
Got your nose. Got your nose.

03:32.180 --> 03:33.772
Got your...

03:54.220 --> 03:56.176
- Hi, son.
- Are those my big-boy parts?

03:56.340 --> 03:57.898
They sure are.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.291
They're not shiny.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.015
Well, they're not brand-new.
They're preowned. So...

04:06.220 --> 04:09.735
They're hand-me-downs
from your cousin Jeffrey.

04:09.940 --> 04:11.419
And they're only for a year.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.931
Hey, Dad, who's that?

04:39.100 --> 04:41.330
That, Rodney, is Bigweld.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.576
The greatest robot in the world.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.578
I thought you were
the greatest robot in the world.

04:46.740 --> 04:48.298
No, besides me.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.212
He's the head of Bigweld Industries.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.412
He invents things
that make everyone's life better.

04:53.620 --> 04:56.498
- Could I meet him?
- Sure, maybe someday.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.974
- Dad?
- Yeah?

04:58.140 --> 05:01.769
- What do you do?
- Me? I work in a big, fancy restaurant.

05:01.980 --> 05:04.210
I'm a dishwasher.

05:08.940 --> 05:12.649
<i>And now, live from Robot City,
it's The Bigweld Show.</i>

05:14.380 --> 05:16.098
Oh, yeah!

05:16.500 --> 05:19.173
Come on, Dad, you're missing it.

05:19.340 --> 05:21.729
All right, Rodney.
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.175
I had to bring work home
with me again, I'm sorry.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.217
Mr. Gunk has really been piling it on.

05:26.380 --> 05:30.168
<i>And now, the host of our show,
Bigweld.</i>

05:30.340 --> 05:34.652
<i>Welcome. This week I thought you'd like
to take a look around Bigweld Industries.</i>

05:34.860 --> 05:38.648
<i>This here is the front gate.
Kind of cute, ain't it?</i>

05:40.620 --> 05:43.737
- Good morning, Tim.
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.896
Tim, who closed the front gate?

05:46.100 --> 05:48.250
Well, I just thought since...

05:48.900 --> 05:51.209
We never shut the gate, Tim.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.457
Shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.134
See, every day, robots come here
from hither and yon...

05:57.300 --> 05:59.416
...bringing us new ideas.

06:00.540 --> 06:03.532
And I listen to
every single one of them.

06:07.940 --> 06:13.014
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

06:13.180 --> 06:15.819
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.976
He's talking to me, Dad.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.893
He sure is, son. He sure is.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.336
<i>Okay, folks, let's get to inventing.</i>

06:28.340 --> 06:30.058
<i>You know, I love to tinker...</i>

06:30.260 --> 06:35.129
<i>...but all the tinkering in the world isn't
useful unless it starts with a good idea.</i>

06:37.180 --> 06:42.413
So look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need.

06:42.580 --> 06:46.129
One idea will lead to another,
and before you know it...

06:48.020 --> 06:51.330
...you've done it.
See a need, fill a need.

06:51.540 --> 06:54.850
That's it, Dad. I have to look for...

06:57.580 --> 06:58.933
...a need.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.534
Easy, now.

07:27.460 --> 07:30.372
- Hey there, sport.
- Oh, hi.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.378
These are your 12-year-old parts.
They're...

07:33.580 --> 07:36.094
Hand-me-downs. I know, Dad.

07:36.260 --> 07:39.218
- I don't mind.
- They are from your cousin...

07:39.420 --> 07:40.773
...Veronica.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.454
You know how popular she is.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.932
Thanks.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.419
Oh, hey. Hey.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.254
Soon as you reach the age where your
warranty expires, you start falling apart.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.849
Pretty soon there's gonna be
more duct tape than me.

08:32.020 --> 08:35.251
- Can I try it now, Dad?
- Oh, Rodney...

08:35.460 --> 08:39.294
- Have you worked all the kinks out of it?
- This is gonna make your job easy.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.410
I invented it for you.

08:44.179 --> 08:45.932
Okay. Let's try it.

08:46.140 --> 08:48.734
Great. Okay, this is it.

08:48.900 --> 08:52.290
Wonderbot, go to work.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.012
Yeah, yeah.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.489
Hey!

09:45.260 --> 09:46.739
Copperbottom!

09:46.940 --> 09:48.214
- Mr. Gunk.
- What is that?

09:48.380 --> 09:51.133
- Oh, that. My son made it.
- What's it doing?

09:51.340 --> 09:55.128
Mr. Gunk, please,
you're making it nervous.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.535
It's wrecking my kitchen!

09:58.620 --> 10:01.088
- I'll stop it.
- No!

10:04.660 --> 10:05.934
Your son, huh?

10:06.140 --> 10:08.415
It wasn't his fault.
He had nothing to do with it.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.969
Yes, sir, he's a brilliant boy.
An inventor.

10:11.180 --> 10:15.014
You, clean up this mess.
And, you, get out.

10:15.220 --> 10:16.494
Inventor.

10:16.660 --> 10:20.255
You're the hand-me-down son of a
dishwasher, and that's all you'll ever be.

10:20.420 --> 10:24.777
Somebody scrape this crud off of me.
And serve it to the customers.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.134
<i>Roundtrip or one-way?</i>

10:27.340 --> 10:29.137
One-way.

10:31.780 --> 10:35.136
There you are. I told you I'd find him.

10:35.300 --> 10:38.736
- It's a mother's instinct.
- Instinct? He left us a note:

10:38.900 --> 10:41.255
"I'm leaving.
I'll be at the train station. "

10:41.460 --> 10:43.974
Never mind. Pick up that suitcase.
You're coming home.

10:44.180 --> 10:48.253
No, Mom. I have to do this.
I'm going to Robot City tonight.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.218
I'm gonna get a job and I'm gonna
help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.

10:51.420 --> 10:52.694
Talk to him.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.579
- Ro...
- Robot City? You're just a kid.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.771
I'm never gonna be someone here.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.534
I wanna be an inventor.
I wanna meet Bigweld.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.053
I wanna be somebody.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.659
You are somebody.

11:03.820 --> 11:06.050
Somebody who's not
getting on that train.

11:06.260 --> 11:09.650
- Yes, I am.
- Talk to him.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.099
- One ticket for Robot City.
- Where are you going?

11:15.300 --> 11:18.292
- Not me. Him.
- But...

11:18.500 --> 11:22.937
Rodney, did you know that when I was
your age, I wanted to be a musician?

11:23.420 --> 11:25.536
I played pretty well too...

11:25.700 --> 11:28.578
...but my dad was worried
I wouldn't be able to make a living.

11:28.780 --> 11:32.534
So I got refitted to be a dishwasher.
Now, I'm not complaining.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.612
But I've always said to myself...

11:36.260 --> 11:40.776
...if I could do it over again,
I would follow my dream.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.936
You've got greatness in you, Rodney.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.579
Never doubt it.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.577
You go to Robot City.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.892
You go meet Bigweld,
and you show him your big ideas.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.334
And, Rodney...

11:53.500 --> 11:57.175
...never, never give up.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.454
All aboard.

12:17.980 --> 12:19.652
Mom.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.409
I won't let you down, Dad.

12:33.580 --> 12:34.933
I'll make you proud.

12:38.140 --> 12:39.812
I know you will.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.858
Excuse me, I wonder if...

13:31.020 --> 13:32.772
- Gave at the office.
- I wonder if you...

13:32.940 --> 13:34.931
Could you direct me
to Bigweld Indust...?

13:35.100 --> 13:37.375
- What?
- Perfect. That will be 50 bucks.

13:37.540 --> 13:38.768
Fifty bucks? For what?

13:38.940 --> 13:41.454
A beautiful picture
of your first moment in Robot City.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.690
There. Your second moment.
That's another $50.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.618
Are you keeping track?

13:46.260 --> 13:49.172
Come on, work with me, work with me.
More pout, less pose.

13:49.380 --> 13:52.178
Great. Inside of you is a fashion model
waiting to throw up.

13:52.380 --> 13:55.577
Give me those eyes. Big eyes, big eyes.
Give me big anime eyes.

13:56.740 --> 13:59.891
- Yeah! Loving it, loving it, loving it!
- I don't want any pictures.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.419
- You don't?
- No.

14:01.580 --> 14:05.289
That's all right. There's no film.
Would you like a map to the stars' homes?

14:05.460 --> 14:07.098
Where did he go?

14:25.100 --> 14:29.252
- Buddy, wanna buy a watch?
- Don't buy us, we're fakes.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.052
Next.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.808
Excuse me, how do I get
to Bigweld Industries?

14:42.980 --> 14:44.254
Oh, great...

14:48.220 --> 14:49.938
Never mind.

15:01.140 --> 15:04.257
Hi, excuse me.
How do I get to Bigweld Industries?

15:07.620 --> 15:08.939
What?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.258
Yeah, thanks.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.650
<i>Cross-town express
to Foundry District...</i>

15:16.820 --> 15:19.573
<i>...with stops at Bigweld Industries
and Battery Park only.</i>

15:20.660 --> 15:24.573
<i>Please tighten all spools, nuts, bolts
and detachable appendages.</i>

15:24.740 --> 15:28.653
<i>Riders with high oil pressure
are advised to take the local.</i>

15:28.820 --> 15:31.618
<i>Thank you, and have a nice day.</i>

15:43.180 --> 15:45.375
No, no.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.569
- Say, are you following me?
- No.

15:54.740 --> 15:57.459
- First time on the cross-town express?
- Well, actually, I...

15:57.620 --> 15:58.894
Oh, boy.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.536
Good luck in the big city. If you can
make it here, you can make it anywhere.

16:02.740 --> 16:06.335
And if you can't make it here,
welcome to the club.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.134
- Oh, no.
- What? What is it?

16:16.340 --> 16:18.137
We're going off the track.
We're gonna crash!

16:18.340 --> 16:20.615
- What?
- I don't wanna die.

16:30.500 --> 16:34.095
I was just kidding.
Just put your head between your legs.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.259
Yeah!

16:46.700 --> 16:47.815
There goes my stop.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.693
I tell you, the things that fall off me...
It's embarrassing.

17:29.060 --> 17:30.413
Sorry.

17:42.980 --> 17:46.336
You know, it used to be a lot worse.
They had this giant hammer...

17:46.500 --> 17:48.058
Oh, they brought it back.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.970
Stick with me. I know this town
like the back of my hand.

18:13.140 --> 18:15.370
Hey, that's new.

18:36.420 --> 18:38.775
Excuse me. Can I help you?

18:38.980 --> 18:40.572
Sorry, I...

18:40.780 --> 18:45.535
- Hey, you're Tim from the TV show.
- That's me.

18:45.740 --> 18:47.014
Well, hey, Tim.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.933
Who closed the gate?
It's never supposed to be...

18:50.100 --> 18:51.419
Yeah, okay, what do you want?

18:53.020 --> 18:55.215
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

18:55.380 --> 18:58.019
I'm an inventor.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.609
Oh, why didn't you say so?

19:01.820 --> 19:03.811
Stand back.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.378
Thanks.

19:22.580 --> 19:24.013
What?

19:24.300 --> 19:27.531
I got you. You see, because you were
all excited and then, boom!

19:29.220 --> 19:32.098
All right, I had my laugh. Go on in.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.892
Now, that's funny.

19:39.740 --> 19:41.731
The second time.

19:41.900 --> 19:46.132
You really think I'm gonna let you in.
But I'm not.

19:46.340 --> 19:49.059
Sorry, kid, nobody gets in.
Company rules.

19:49.260 --> 19:52.297
Company ru...? Well, then
how do they hire new inventors?

19:52.500 --> 19:54.730
They don't. Those days are over.

19:54.900 --> 19:58.939
My advice: Come back two years ago.
Then the job is yours.

20:11.780 --> 20:16.615
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

20:16.820 --> 20:19.050
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.570
My goodness,
what a remarkable legacy.

20:23.740 --> 20:26.538
Concern for the common robot.

20:26.740 --> 20:30.858
You don't come across old-fashioned
values like that anymore, friends.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.499
And for good reason.

20:32.660 --> 20:34.491
There's no money in it!

20:34.660 --> 20:38.335
Hello? Memo to Bigweld:
We're not a charity.

20:38.540 --> 20:41.498
That's why old fat face
no longer sits in the big chair.

20:41.660 --> 20:43.093
He's a relic.

20:43.300 --> 20:47.373
So I don't wanna hear another,
"Where's Bigweld?"

20:49.620 --> 20:53.135
We'll see him next month at the
Bigweld Ball. He always goes to that.

20:55.940 --> 20:59.216
Now, let's get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny...

20:59.380 --> 21:02.258
...out of
Mr. and Mrs. Average-Knucklehead.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.094
What's our big-ticket item?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.095
Upgrades, people. Upgrades.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.773
That's how we make the dough.

21:14.940 --> 21:19.536
Now, if we're telling robots that no matter
what they're made of, they're "fine"...

21:19.700 --> 21:23.010
...how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves...

21:23.180 --> 21:25.694
...to buy our upgrades
and make themselves look better?

21:25.900 --> 21:29.210
Therefore, I've come up
with a new slogan.

21:29.420 --> 21:32.856
"Why be you when you can be new?"

21:35.500 --> 21:38.094
I gotta tell you, I think it's brilliant...

21:38.260 --> 21:44.096
...but, honestly, I'd like to hear
what you employees think about this.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.253
- Hear, hear.
- Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.458
Just don't look down.

22:05.180 --> 22:06.169
Hey.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.572
Get off.

22:10.140 --> 22:11.732
Go on, get off.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.092
Get off of...

22:15.300 --> 22:17.860
Cappy, you haven't said a word.

22:18.020 --> 22:21.729
- It gave me chills.
- Thank you, thank you.

22:21.940 --> 22:23.771
- But...
- But?

22:23.980 --> 22:27.768
I'm just wondering,
why would robots buy new upgrades...

22:27.940 --> 22:30.500
...if parts are so much cheaper?

22:30.660 --> 22:32.855
Oh, right. Well, that's easy.

22:33.020 --> 22:37.810
Because as of today,
we are no longer making spare parts.

22:38.020 --> 22:41.979
Do you know what I call robots
who can't afford upgrades? Scrap metal.

22:42.140 --> 22:45.212
You see them on the streets,
misshapen and rust-covered.

22:45.420 --> 22:49.936
They turn your insides out.
You wanna run home and scrub yourself.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.933
Now, Cappy, I want your department
to push our new slogan.

22:53.140 --> 22:55.859
In fact, I'm moving you
into the office right next to mine.

22:56.020 --> 22:59.410
We'll be working very,
very closely together on this one.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.571
- Won't that be fun?
- Oodles.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.290
- Oh, so sorry, I...
- What the...?

23:15.500 --> 23:21.575
Sir, I am a young inventor, and it has
been my dream to come to Robot City...

23:21.780 --> 23:25.011
...and to present my ideas
to Mr. Bigweld.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.772
Who doesn't seem to be here.

23:27.180 --> 23:31.332
Gee, no, no. But while he's away,
he left me in charge.

23:31.540 --> 23:34.179
Oh, well, then let me show you
what this can do.

23:34.820 --> 23:39.814
I have a better idea. Why don't you
let me show you what it can do.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.254
It can do this!

24:02.500 --> 24:03.979
So how did it go?

24:06.860 --> 24:10.170
What the heck
is going on around here?

24:10.340 --> 24:14.731
Some highly polished jerk
is sitting in Bigweld's chair.

24:15.500 --> 24:19.288
And you're sitting
on the sidewalk, magnetized.

24:19.500 --> 24:23.539
Listen, I'll be back,
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

24:23.740 --> 24:26.652
When you pick a lost cause,
you really commit.

24:26.820 --> 24:30.369
Where do they make dreamers like you?
Get lost, freak!

26:32.460 --> 26:34.530
All right, break time.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.616
All right, break time's over.

26:39.780 --> 26:41.498
Chop-chop.

26:43.780 --> 26:45.293
Look who's here.

26:45.500 --> 26:49.175
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie. How's my boy?

26:49.380 --> 26:53.498
Great. I did just what you told me.
No more spare parts.

26:53.660 --> 26:57.619
In a couple of weeks, those broken-down
losers out there will be scrap metal.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.539
You will be up to your bloomers
in broken-elbow junk.

27:00.740 --> 27:02.378
Such a good boy.

27:02.540 --> 27:04.132
And after you finish off Bigweld...

27:04.300 --> 27:06.370
...there will be nobody
out there to fix them.

27:06.580 --> 27:08.491
Exactly!

27:08.700 --> 27:10.611
You wanna swing that one
by me again?

27:10.820 --> 27:13.971
Idiot! Those outmodes look up to him.

27:14.180 --> 27:17.570
- Suppose he decides to come back?
- Oh, come on, Mom.

27:17.780 --> 27:21.011
- He's not gonna be trouble where he is.
- What are you afraid of?

27:21.180 --> 27:22.454
Grow some bolts.

27:22.660 --> 27:25.015
Or do you want to end up
like your father?

27:25.300 --> 27:27.495
Hey, son. Good to see you.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.099
Think what it would mean.

27:29.260 --> 27:33.936
Not Bigweld Industries,
Ratchet Industries.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.374
Keep talking.

27:35.540 --> 27:38.054
Ratchet City!

27:38.220 --> 27:41.132
Yes, everything shiny.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.088
No more Bigweld, no more outmode.

27:45.260 --> 27:47.012
Let's do it!

27:47.180 --> 27:49.171
That's my boy!

27:56.900 --> 27:58.856
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something?

27:59.020 --> 28:02.774
- You look thin.
- No, no, no, Mom. I gotta go. Bye.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.055
Bye, Pop.

28:04.260 --> 28:07.138
So long, son.
Good luck with your dastardly plans.

28:30.340 --> 28:31.978
Hey.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.138
Hi there.

28:34.300 --> 28:40.057
Listen, if I seem to be getting smaller,
it's because I'm leaving.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.899
Foot, don't fail me now.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.978
Stop! Hey, you got my foot!

29:26.540 --> 29:29.179
Oh, great. Happy now?

29:29.380 --> 29:32.452
Not until you give me back
my foot, you mugger.

29:32.660 --> 29:36.255
I am not a mugger. I happen to be...

29:36.420 --> 29:37.455
...a scrounger.

29:37.660 --> 29:39.890
I didn't know you were
at the end of that foot.

29:40.060 --> 29:42.290
Here, let me help you with that.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.933
No, no, no, I'll do it myself.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.136
I have my pride, you know. Over here.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.690
Oh, no. No, not that close.
Hold on, hold on.

29:49.860 --> 29:51.498
No. No, no.

29:54.380 --> 29:57.019
What's the use? There's nothing left.

29:57.180 --> 30:00.695
Hey, Diesel, I found you a voice box.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.214
Here's another one.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.976
That's no good. Give me that.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.655
I can never find parts in my size.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.296
What is it, boy?

30:26.100 --> 30:28.409
Hey, Fender, have you lost weight?

30:28.580 --> 30:30.536
Lost weight?

30:30.700 --> 30:33.931
Look at where you're looking.
He's a head in a basket.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.250
We're doomed, I knew it.
We're doomed.

30:36.460 --> 30:40.294
Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic nut?
Why, I'd smack you if I had a hand.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.851
Wow, speak of the devil, here I come.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.089
Dang!

30:47.460 --> 30:48.734
Check this out.

30:48.940 --> 30:52.410
Who would throw away
such a cute little doodad?

30:52.660 --> 30:55.299
- Don't be scared.
- Hey, that's mine.

30:55.740 --> 30:58.732
That's him. That's the guy.
I would know that face.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.653
I know that face,
and I know that foot.

31:02.300 --> 31:03.813
He's over there, moron.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.210
That's the perpetrator.
He knocked my head off.

31:06.380 --> 31:09.019
- You want another piece of me?
- All right, buster.

31:09.180 --> 31:13.014
If you think you can mess with my
big brother, you're... You're kind of cute.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.695
Piper, would you behave yourself.

31:15.860 --> 31:18.533
Now, come on,
let's get Fender fixed. Again.

31:18.820 --> 31:21.129
Here's your thingamabob.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.450
By the way, the name's Piper.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.690
Rhymes with "viper. "

31:26.900 --> 31:28.538
See you around.

31:33.140 --> 31:35.210
We've told you a hundred times:

31:35.380 --> 31:37.496
"Don't talk to strange men. "
Thank you, Manuel.

31:37.700 --> 31:40.658
I talk to you.
Who's stranger than that?

31:47.420 --> 31:50.571
I got good news, and I got bad news.

31:50.780 --> 31:53.055
- What's the bad news?
- I checked the stock book.

31:53.220 --> 31:56.417
And as of today, they are no longer
making parts for your model.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.094
You have been officially outmoded.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.779
Outmoded? Well, that's fine.

32:00.940 --> 32:02.453
What's the good news?!

32:02.660 --> 32:07.256
Well, when we had your parts,
they were on sale.

32:12.140 --> 32:16.179
How could this happen to me?
I'm practically a kid.

32:16.380 --> 32:20.134
Look, pull yourself together.
All you need is an upgrade.

32:21.620 --> 32:24.180
That new-upgrade smell.

32:24.380 --> 32:26.848
Just came in, fully loaded. Look.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.971
It's got cup-holders, standard.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.533
Does it come in plus sizes?

32:30.700 --> 32:35.171
Sure, take a look at the new
Bigweld spring collection.

32:36.780 --> 32:40.853
I can't afford that fancy stuff.
All I need is one stinking neck joint.

32:41.020 --> 32:44.171
No. Why did this happen to me?

32:46.940 --> 32:48.976
I'm hurting me. Idiot.

32:49.180 --> 32:52.536
Sorry, pal, it's either upgrade
or the chop shop for you.

32:52.740 --> 32:54.378
The chop shop?

32:55.140 --> 32:58.132
I'm fine, I'm fine. Look, no hands.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.248
Ta-da! I'm back. Miss me?

33:04.460 --> 33:07.054
- No one's going to the chop shop.
- That's right.

33:07.220 --> 33:09.051
What do you think
we can get for him?

33:09.220 --> 33:11.575
Will you stop? Listen, shiny pants...

33:11.780 --> 33:14.169
...you get back there
and find a part for my brother.

33:14.340 --> 33:18.652
We are not junk, we are not scrap,
and we will not be treated this way.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.178
I'm sorry. I don't have the parts.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.298
Well, do you have two washers,
an S-spring and some Fastweld?

33:25.460 --> 33:26.893
I can fix you easy.

33:29.180 --> 33:32.217
The Force is strong with this one.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.658
When was the last time
you got oiled?

33:44.980 --> 33:47.175
I can't answer that
with my kid sister here.

33:47.340 --> 33:48.614
Can it, Fender.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.095
Hold still. This might tickle.

33:51.260 --> 33:53.137
We haven't been properly introduced.

33:53.340 --> 33:55.217
I'm Fender. Used to be Bumper...

33:55.380 --> 33:57.769
...but had to change it
when we came in to the country.

33:57.940 --> 33:59.532
Copperbottom, Rodney Copperbottom.

33:59.740 --> 34:02.698
Riddle me this:
Why did I meet you among the garbage?

34:02.900 --> 34:05.334
Well, today I tried
to get in to see Bigweld.

34:06.340 --> 34:10.049
Well, if you find him, tell him
we really need him to come back.

34:10.260 --> 34:11.898
He cared about bots like us.

34:12.100 --> 34:15.172
I heard they've done him in
and left the rest of us to fall apart.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.936
Well, that ought to do it.

34:18.100 --> 34:21.614
Look at that! And he fixed my neck.

34:21.780 --> 34:23.610
- Sweeper!
- Sweeper?

34:24.300 --> 34:26.210
Make yourself scarce.

34:32.139 --> 34:33.368
What's the big deal?

34:33.540 --> 34:37.248
- Well, if you're an outmode like Fender...
- Hey.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.655
They sweep you up
and take you to the chop shop.

34:39.820 --> 34:44.257
Where they melt you down
and turn you into something else.

34:44.420 --> 34:46.138
You mean...?

34:47.020 --> 34:48.248
Yep.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.739
Sweepers. Sweepers.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.492
Help. Here's one outmode
you're not gonna get.

35:00.780 --> 35:02.611
Fender, run!

35:08.340 --> 35:10.012
That was close.

35:10.180 --> 35:12.614
When in Robot City,
guests of the Rusties... That's us.

35:12.780 --> 35:15.419
- stay at Aunt Fanny's boarding house,
where our motto is:

35:15.580 --> 35:17.935
"Beats rusting outside. "

35:18.300 --> 35:22.179
Let me just let her know you're here.
Aunt Fanny!

35:22.380 --> 35:24.848
- We brought someone.
- I'm in the kitchen.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.932
- Are you sure your aunt won't mind?
- Relax, she's not my aunt.

35:28.100 --> 35:31.888
She just takes in bots who are broke.
Bless her little heart.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.056
Well, then why is she called
Aunt Fanny?

35:34.220 --> 35:35.778
We couldn't call her Aunt Booty.

35:39.340 --> 35:40.773
Oh, crap.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.532
She's a little artsy-fartsy.

35:42.700 --> 35:45.533
The artsy's okay,
but when she gets fartsy...

35:45.700 --> 35:48.168
Look at... Oh, right on my shoes.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.819
I'm so clumsy.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.938
Well, hello there. What's your name?

35:53.140 --> 35:54.334
I'm Rodney Bigbottom...

35:54.500 --> 35:57.458
No, I'm Rodney Copperbottom.
Copperbottom.

35:57.980 --> 36:01.131
That's a wonderful name, Bigbottom.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.693
Well, I just...

36:04.860 --> 36:07.533
- What happened to your friend?
- He's been rear-ended.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.496
Oh, there you are.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.060
Aunt Fanny, he needs a place to stay.

36:15.220 --> 36:17.734
Well, just make yourself at home.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.856
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.373
My pleasure.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.173
See a need, fill a need.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.893
Hey, just like Bigweld.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.092
Bigweld. That's a lot of robot.

36:30.860 --> 36:32.896
Come on. You can bunk with me.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.857
We'll ignore the gossip.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.732
You missed a spot.

36:42.940 --> 36:44.931
Fender, get out of my room!

36:45.140 --> 36:46.414
I'm not in your room.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.696
I am now. Now I'm not.
I am. Not. Am...

36:48.860 --> 36:50.771
Get out of my room.

36:53.700 --> 36:57.136
Oh, man, this is my third oil change
today. Something's wrong with me.

36:58.100 --> 36:59.453
Sorry.

37:00.380 --> 37:03.292
Here we are. Home sweet home.

37:03.460 --> 37:05.735
What's mine is yours.

37:05.900 --> 37:07.413
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get them.

37:07.580 --> 37:09.411
Look at that.
Now they're arm-wrestling.

37:12.660 --> 37:16.016
Could you separate them?
Hurry, my backside itches.

37:39.300 --> 37:43.134
I know that sounds bad,
but I'm just doing musical arm farts.

37:44.940 --> 37:46.259
You know how to do those?

37:46.460 --> 37:49.691
They're hard to do, because we're metal,
but that's where the skill comes in.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.578
I'm real close. Listen.

37:51.740 --> 37:53.298
No, wait.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.178
No, wait, wait.

37:55.980 --> 37:59.017
You can't tell me that didn't sound like a...
Like an old man.

38:00.060 --> 38:03.257
You know, I'm a little tired.
Maybe tomorrow.

38:03.420 --> 38:05.411
Kind of a rough day, huh?

38:05.620 --> 38:08.180
Kind of. My dad's probably
sitting by the phone...

38:08.340 --> 38:10.296
...waiting for his brilliant son
to call...

38:10.460 --> 38:13.736
...and tell him what a big success
my first day was.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.619
I know it's not your problem.

38:15.780 --> 38:18.055
If you burden your friends,
you won't have any.

38:18.220 --> 38:19.812
What are you, a fortune cookie?

38:19.980 --> 38:22.574
"That's what friends... "

38:22.860 --> 38:24.134
You consider me a friend?

38:24.340 --> 38:26.171
Sure, what else would I consider you?

38:26.340 --> 38:28.934
An embarrassment,
a way to rebel against your parents...

38:29.100 --> 38:31.330
...a desperate cry for help.
The list is endless.

38:31.660 --> 38:33.139
Let's just stick with friend.

38:33.300 --> 38:36.098
You know, even though you had
a discouraging day, remember...

38:36.260 --> 38:38.057
...there's another one
coming tomorrow.

38:38.220 --> 38:40.939
You know, my last roommate
jumped out that window.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.491
Hey, Fender.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.532
Yeah, baby. Let it rip!

38:52.340 --> 38:54.171
Guys, come on,
what are you, 3 years old?

38:54.340 --> 38:56.251
This is how a man does it.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.411
You guys are so gross.

38:58.580 --> 39:01.492
Besides, this is how you do it.

39:02.060 --> 39:04.699
Hey, kids, get a load of this.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.931
Aunt Fanny...

39:11.100 --> 39:13.091
...we were using our arms.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.774
Oh, excuse me.

39:15.940 --> 39:18.693
Lady, please...

39:19.140 --> 39:21.256
...see a doctor.

39:32.340 --> 39:33.739
Breakfast.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.339
This will perk everyone up.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.730
Some of Aunt Fanny's
fresh-brewed grease.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.219
Yummy!

39:39.420 --> 39:41.729
Careful, it's hot.

39:48.100 --> 39:50.011
So, what are you guys doing today?

39:50.580 --> 39:52.650
- We're doing it.
- What about you?

39:52.820 --> 39:54.697
Bigweld's disappeared,
and you're sitting here.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.532
That's already been established.

39:56.740 --> 39:59.732
- I gotta find out what happened to him.
- Hey, you want my advice?

39:59.900 --> 40:01.652
- Sure.
- Forget it.

40:01.820 --> 40:05.210
"Never try, never fail. "
Those are the words I live by.

40:05.420 --> 40:08.332
Crank, the idol of millions is gone,
and no one seems to care.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.735
There should be an angry mob
out there.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.413
What the...?

40:15.540 --> 40:17.451
Wow, that was great, psychic friend.

40:17.620 --> 40:20.930
Now say, "Money should be
falling from the sky. "

40:21.100 --> 40:23.489
Say it. Say it.

40:25.260 --> 40:27.410
Sorry, folks, all sold out.

40:27.580 --> 40:29.810
Nothing but upgrades from here on in.

40:29.980 --> 40:32.619
But I like myself just the way I am.

40:32.780 --> 40:35.169
- We can't afford upgrades!
- Let's get him!

40:35.340 --> 40:38.252
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Don't throw me.

40:39.140 --> 40:41.131
Isn't that the guy
that fixed Fender's neck?

40:41.300 --> 40:42.892
Yeah, that guy fixes bots.

40:43.060 --> 40:44.812
Yeah, that kid can help you.

40:45.020 --> 40:47.136
Brace yourself.
You're about to get popular.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.978
Only those with insurance.

40:50.140 --> 40:53.018
Oh, I forgot. Everybody, come on.

40:53.540 --> 40:55.735
Parts, man. I need parts.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.539
You don't look that... bad.

40:59.860 --> 41:02.135
- Hey, everybody, spare parts!
- Yeah!

41:02.340 --> 41:05.412
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's wrong with you robots?

41:05.620 --> 41:07.736
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.333
Why do you have two noses?

41:09.500 --> 41:12.492
One's for showing, one's for blowing.

41:12.660 --> 41:15.891
- Sorry.
- Hey, could you look at my arm?

41:16.260 --> 41:18.410
- Nice grip.
- Like iron.

41:18.620 --> 41:21.612
- I can't get rid of this spare tire.
- I am losing my mind.

41:22.260 --> 41:23.693
Back off, back off.

41:23.860 --> 41:26.454
He's got his own dreams
that won't come true.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.219
See a need, fill a need.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.093
Wait.

41:37.020 --> 41:38.817
Who wants to get fixed?

42:19.540 --> 42:22.418
Thanks, Rodney. You're number one.

42:38.180 --> 42:41.456
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

42:50.140 --> 42:51.812
Oh, yeah.

42:52.180 --> 42:55.092
I have never felt so relaxed.

42:55.260 --> 42:59.412
Say, do you mind giving me a little
scratch between the shoulder blades?

42:59.860 --> 43:02.499
There you... Easy, tiger.

43:02.660 --> 43:04.252
Hey! Take it easy.

43:04.420 --> 43:06.695
Hey, what are you trying to do,
kill me?

43:06.860 --> 43:09.454
Relax. It's me, your mommy.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.293
- How did you get in here?
- I came up the air shaft.

43:12.460 --> 43:15.020
I know you don't like
anybody here to see me.

43:15.180 --> 43:17.899
- Well, what do you want?
- Someone's fixing them.

43:18.100 --> 43:21.012
- What?
- Someone is repairing outmodes...

43:21.180 --> 43:23.740
...and they are laughing at you.
- Who?

43:23.900 --> 43:26.289
And are you sure they're not
laughing with me?

43:26.700 --> 43:27.974
Yes.

43:28.140 --> 43:31.849
So what if one crazy fanatic repairs
a few outmodes? Who cares?

43:32.020 --> 43:35.456
Think. Use those brains
I stole for you. Today, it's one.

43:35.620 --> 43:38.498
What about tomorrow, when
everybody gets the idea this is okay?

43:38.660 --> 43:41.333
"We can fix ourselves.
We don't need upgrades.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.853
We want Bigweld. "

43:43.020 --> 43:44.931
Then what happens to you?

43:45.140 --> 43:46.971
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

43:47.140 --> 43:50.018
We've got to find out
who this is and stop him.

43:50.220 --> 43:53.769
Not stop him, crush him, destroy him.

43:53.940 --> 43:58.013
And by the way, I brought you
a little something for your desk.

44:05.420 --> 44:08.253
- Is there anyone else waiting?
- Let me look.

44:10.180 --> 44:12.250
- A few.
- "A few"?

44:12.420 --> 44:15.412
What did you expect, Rodney?
Bigweld was gone.

44:15.580 --> 44:20.051
Sweepers were on the loose,
but then came Copperbottom.

44:20.220 --> 44:22.609
I'm getting all static-y
just thinking about it.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.493
I'm not Bigweld.
These robots need parts.

44:25.660 --> 44:28.254
Mail call. Mail call.

44:28.420 --> 44:30.695
Copperbottom,
this one's from your mom.

44:30.860 --> 44:32.851
Oh, is there anything for me?

44:33.020 --> 44:35.659
Oh, I got something for you.

44:35.820 --> 44:37.492
That's from my sister.

44:37.660 --> 44:39.093
I recognize the handwriting.

44:39.700 --> 44:41.292
Is anything wrong?

44:41.460 --> 44:44.770
I'll say. His father's got
one foot in the junkyard...

44:44.940 --> 44:48.455
...and if they can't find new parts
for him, he's only got a few miles left.

44:48.940 --> 44:51.579
Rodney, are you really worried
about your dad?

44:51.780 --> 44:53.293
Do you wanna go home?

44:53.500 --> 44:55.411
Well, if I go home,
I still can't help him.

44:55.580 --> 44:58.048
We're out of parts.
We've gotta get to Bigweld.

44:58.220 --> 45:01.178
He's the only one that can fix this.

45:03.260 --> 45:06.411
He's trying to tell us something.
What is it, boy? What's wrong?

45:06.900 --> 45:09.778
Bigweld is going...

45:09.940 --> 45:11.214
...dancing.

45:11.380 --> 45:14.292
Of course, the Bigweld Ball.

45:14.580 --> 45:17.299
You can't have the Bigweld Ball
without Bigweld.

45:17.500 --> 45:20.060
Well, that's it, then.
I'm going to the Bigweld Ball.

45:20.220 --> 45:22.290
What? That's the fanciest party
of the year.

45:22.460 --> 45:24.052
You'll never get past the gate.

45:34.540 --> 45:37.452
- Can I help you?
- I think maybe you can.

45:37.620 --> 45:40.692
This is Count Roderick
von Brokenzipper.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.816
Formerly Count Velcro.

45:43.780 --> 45:45.259
Where are the trumpets?

45:45.460 --> 45:48.133
We were promised trumpets
to announce the count's arrival.

45:48.300 --> 45:51.417
Sorry, Your Grace.
Beat me until you're happy.

45:51.580 --> 45:54.856
He's happy. And I'm not feeling
too bad myself.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.730
- Let me... You're not on the list.
- We're what?

45:58.900 --> 46:00.731
Once again.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.417
Thank you. Fine, we will go.

46:04.580 --> 46:06.172
You'll explain to your superiors...

46:06.340 --> 46:10.458
...why we were not able to attend your
little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.

46:10.660 --> 46:12.651
But we're leaving in a huff.

46:12.820 --> 46:15.459
No, no. No. Please, go right in.

46:15.620 --> 46:18.532
In fact, would the count
like to hit me?

46:18.740 --> 46:21.618
The count hit you?
The arrogance of some people.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.613
I will hit you on his behalf.

46:25.540 --> 46:26.973
Thank you, Your Grace.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.339
Okay, let's split up.

46:31.500 --> 46:34.219
If you see Bigweld, come and find me.

46:34.660 --> 46:37.094
If anything goes wrong,
we'll signal each other.

46:37.260 --> 46:40.696
What kind of signal do you want?
You want something kind of subtle, like:

46:41.700 --> 46:43.019
Or:

46:44.180 --> 46:45.613
Oh, how about this:

46:50.420 --> 46:53.571
Ricola!

46:53.940 --> 46:56.215
Subtle. Let's get to work.

46:56.700 --> 46:59.339
A screwdriver, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.899
Yes, sir.

47:18.860 --> 47:20.930
I'll have what he's having.

47:21.300 --> 47:25.259
You know, Cappy, it's nice that you
can see me like this, away from work.

47:25.420 --> 47:29.333
See my more casual, fun-loving side.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.809
Now, where were we?

47:35.020 --> 47:38.296
Well, there are never any
interesting men at these parties.

47:38.460 --> 47:41.372
Hello, ladies.
Fender von Fender at your service.

47:41.700 --> 47:43.895
Hi, I'm Loretta...

47:44.060 --> 47:45.288
...Geargrinder.

47:45.460 --> 47:49.772
Anyone dressed as badly as you are
must be an eccentric billionaire.

47:51.300 --> 47:54.053
Ladies and gentlebots,
now coming to the stage...

47:54.220 --> 47:56.211
...the top bot, the big bolt...

47:56.380 --> 47:59.975
...who's your daddy?
Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.

48:00.220 --> 48:03.257
Thank you. We now come
to the point of the evening...

48:03.420 --> 48:06.696
...where I have the tremendous honor
of introducing...

48:06.860 --> 48:09.897
- Excuse me. Sorry.
... our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...

48:10.100 --> 48:12.534
...who, unfortunately,
is unable to attend.

48:13.700 --> 48:16.260
- What?
- He sends his apologies...

48:16.420 --> 48:18.888
...his love and a small box
of assorted cookies.

48:19.100 --> 48:21.978
- Not coming?
- And what are you doing here?

48:22.140 --> 48:23.812
What have you done with Bigweld?

48:25.740 --> 48:27.890
How come we don't see him
anymore, huh?

48:28.100 --> 48:31.092
Okay. Security,
we have a party-crasher.

48:31.260 --> 48:35.333
Yeah, that's right, and I had to put
all this junk on in order to get in here...

48:35.500 --> 48:39.652
...so that I could tell Bigweld
that you are outmoding millions of bots.

48:40.180 --> 48:42.933
And I know because
I spend all day fixing them.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.568
You.

49:04.060 --> 49:07.370
Oh, my darling, that is the cry
of the deep-doo-doo bird.

49:07.540 --> 49:09.337
I must fly.

49:10.740 --> 49:12.093
Take him for a drive...

49:12.260 --> 49:16.094
...and bring me back
his exact weight in paper clips.

49:17.460 --> 49:19.610
- No!
- No?

49:20.500 --> 49:22.252
I'll escort him out.

49:22.660 --> 49:25.254
You don't wanna look bad
in front of your people, do you?

49:25.420 --> 49:26.853
- Good point.
- When I get back...

49:27.020 --> 49:29.011
...I'll show you my casual,
fun-loving side.

49:29.180 --> 49:30.772
Oh, you.

49:30.980 --> 49:33.130
- Get moving.
- What? What are you doing?

49:33.300 --> 49:35.131
Saving your life.

49:35.980 --> 49:37.811
- Come on.
- Let him go.

49:37.980 --> 49:39.572
Let him go. Let him go.

49:39.740 --> 49:41.856
- Get out of here, you idiot.
- Get him!

49:42.060 --> 49:43.778
- Fender, let's go.
- You know him?

49:43.940 --> 49:45.532
Fender, wait for me.

49:46.020 --> 49:47.658
Wonderbot.

49:49.580 --> 49:51.298
Get out of my way!

49:52.500 --> 49:54.491
Hey, Tim,
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.656
Oh, you again.

50:00.260 --> 50:01.852
Oh, that was amazing.

50:02.020 --> 50:05.296
- So where do we go now?
- I'm taking you to the train station.

50:05.500 --> 50:08.572
- What? No way.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

50:08.740 --> 50:10.970
Ratchet will use your head
for a hood ornament.

50:11.140 --> 50:13.529
I'm not leaving until I find Bigweld.

50:13.700 --> 50:15.497
- That's not...
- Can't you take me to him?

50:17.820 --> 50:19.936
I must be out of my mind.

50:30.180 --> 50:32.375
<i>Au réservoir, my darling.</i>

50:33.500 --> 50:36.776
- Thanks for walking me home.
- Thanks for carrying me up that hill.

50:36.980 --> 50:39.892
- Until tomorrow?
- I shall count the seconds.

50:40.300 --> 50:42.177
So far, I'm up to four.

50:43.140 --> 50:45.256
You crazy nut boy.

50:45.460 --> 50:47.576
Crazy about you.

50:59.340 --> 51:02.889
<i>I'm singing in the oil</i>

51:03.060 --> 51:06.211
<i>I'm singing in the oil</i>

51:06.380 --> 51:09.099
<i>After all that work and toil</i>

51:09.260 --> 51:12.969
<i>I'm just slipping in the oil</i>

51:13.140 --> 51:16.371
<i>I know where I've been sent</i>

51:16.540 --> 51:19.850
<i>I'm covered in lubricant</i>

51:20.060 --> 51:22.016
My life has turned around.

51:22.180 --> 51:25.968
From now on, I'm a winner!

51:26.380 --> 51:29.213
Stop, you've made a mistake.
I'm alive. You can't do this.

51:29.380 --> 51:30.813
Help.

51:39.380 --> 51:41.257
Okay, we tried. Let's get out of here.

51:41.420 --> 51:42.899
No, no, no. Something's up.

51:43.060 --> 51:44.971
Look at all these newspapers
and this mail.

51:45.140 --> 51:47.859
Come on. They probably
stopped delivering these years ago.

51:48.020 --> 51:49.578
Paper.

51:51.420 --> 51:53.297
Late edition.

51:53.500 --> 51:56.378
- You say something?
- Nice one of you.

51:56.540 --> 51:59.259
Come on.
We gotta get you out of here.

52:07.540 --> 52:09.770
Big, creaky door.

52:09.940 --> 52:11.055
Perfect.

52:35.660 --> 52:37.332
Look at this.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.491
This is Bigweld's actual workshop.

52:39.660 --> 52:41.571
I recognize it from his old TV show.

52:41.740 --> 52:45.130
Could you keep it down?
We're not supposed to be here.

52:47.220 --> 52:48.619
Do you know what these are?

52:48.780 --> 52:51.374
These are Bigweld's
original invention designs.

52:51.540 --> 52:54.498
- That's his own writing.
- This is strange.

52:54.660 --> 52:56.890
How come it just stops in the middle?

52:57.060 --> 52:59.016
Look at this.

52:59.180 --> 53:02.650
Remember, he used to have
these on his show?

53:02.820 --> 53:05.095
Rodney, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

53:05.260 --> 53:07.296
Why are they so dusty?

53:07.460 --> 53:09.291
Wait, don't.

53:34.260 --> 53:37.093
This is much more elaborate
than the ones on his show.

54:11.300 --> 54:12.892
Rodney, what do we do?

54:13.060 --> 54:16.575
I don't know.
This is kind of a first for me.

54:22.140 --> 54:24.654
- Yeah!
- It's him.

54:33.740 --> 54:36.538
- Who's the king of the beach?
- Are you all right?

54:36.740 --> 54:40.653
Well, considering I'm an old fat guy
who just crashed to the floor...

54:40.820 --> 54:43.459
...I'm fantastic.
Now, who the heck are you?

54:43.620 --> 54:44.848
I'm Rodney.

54:45.020 --> 54:47.853
Oh, I thought you were
the dominoes delivery boy.

54:48.060 --> 54:50.733
Come on, let's set them up again,
only bigger.

54:50.940 --> 54:53.738
Sir, is this what you've
been working on?

54:53.940 --> 54:56.693
This is why no one sees you?

54:57.260 --> 54:59.979
Young man,
nobody likes a chatterbox.

55:00.180 --> 55:02.091
But there's a terrible crisis,
Mr. Bigweld.

55:02.380 --> 55:04.496
We need to talk.

55:05.500 --> 55:09.573
Son, I've gotta tell you,
you're making a lousy first impression.

55:09.740 --> 55:13.892
Please, sir, he is your biggest fan.
In fact, he's an inventor just like you.

55:14.060 --> 55:16.016
- Well...
- Show him that thing you made.

55:16.340 --> 55:18.410
A device? A doohickey?
A thingamajig?

55:20.300 --> 55:24.088
Now, don't be scared.
Show Mr. Bigweld what you can do.

55:24.260 --> 55:26.455
Go on. It's okay.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.936
Is that what it's supposed to do?

55:34.580 --> 55:36.093
It gets nervous under pressure...

55:36.300 --> 55:38.734
Son, let me give you
a good piece of advice.

55:38.900 --> 55:40.697
- Yes?
- Give up.

55:40.860 --> 55:43.420
What? You're telling me to quit?

55:43.620 --> 55:46.692
I said "give up,"
but "quit" works just as good.

55:48.700 --> 55:50.656
Is that what you did?
Is that why you're sitting here...

55:50.820 --> 55:53.937
...letting Ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes?

55:54.100 --> 55:56.898
Kid, sometimes you just gotta know
when you're licked.

55:57.060 --> 56:00.450
But you're Bigweld.
You can fix anything.

56:00.620 --> 56:02.053
I used to think so.

56:02.260 --> 56:05.411
To me, having the company
was all about making life better.

56:05.620 --> 56:08.578
With Ratchet, it was making money
that came first.

56:08.740 --> 56:12.699
I became old-fashioned, an outmode.

56:13.060 --> 56:16.496
Go home, kid.
If he beat me, he's gonna beat you.

56:16.660 --> 56:19.857
The world you're looking for
no longer exists. You missed it.

56:20.020 --> 56:21.772
Find some other foolish dream.

56:21.980 --> 56:24.540
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very, very...

56:24.700 --> 56:27.498
...very busy.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.218
Yeah, I can see that.

56:32.260 --> 56:35.491
All I ever wanted
was to grow up to be like him.

56:46.260 --> 56:48.137
Help. Open the door.

56:48.300 --> 56:50.291
Open the door.

56:51.860 --> 56:53.691
Close the door. Close the door!

57:03.380 --> 57:06.099
Wow, look at all these parts.
It's a smorgasbord.

57:06.260 --> 57:09.093
Look at that. So many things
I've wanted all my life.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.699
Oh, that's pretty.

57:27.260 --> 57:29.455
Okay, Mother, this way.

57:29.660 --> 57:31.537
Let me look, please. I can't bear it.

57:31.940 --> 57:34.056
No peeking, now. It's a surprise.

57:34.260 --> 57:35.534
Oh, you are a wicked boy.

57:35.700 --> 57:37.099
And look.

57:37.740 --> 57:40.413
- For me?
- It's got a full tank of gas.

57:40.580 --> 57:42.491
If you're ready to mow,
she's ready to go.

57:42.660 --> 57:45.618
Has any mother ever had a better son?

57:45.780 --> 57:48.374
By the way, I found out
who's been fixing those outmodes.

57:48.540 --> 57:49.939
So tomorrow, these babies...

57:50.100 --> 57:52.568
...are gonna chop him up
along with all his buddies...

57:52.740 --> 57:55.971
...and every other walking pile of junk
I'm sick of looking at.

57:57.500 --> 57:58.853
What's that?

58:28.100 --> 58:30.170
This is so wrong. This is so wrong.

58:30.740 --> 58:33.334
Help. Help!

58:40.820 --> 58:43.129
Rivet Town, please. One-way.

58:47.540 --> 58:48.768
Hi, Mom.

58:48.940 --> 58:52.012
Oh, I'm doing fine. How are you?

58:52.180 --> 58:55.809
<i>- And Dad?
- He's right here. I'll put him on.</i>

58:55.980 --> 58:58.414
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

58:58.620 --> 59:00.372
Hey, Dad. How are you feeling?

59:00.540 --> 59:03.657
Oh, fine, fine. I...

59:04.580 --> 59:06.571
I've just been a little
under the weather.

59:06.740 --> 59:08.696
No, we're just having a little trouble...

59:08.860 --> 59:11.818
...finding your old man
a replacement part, that's all.

59:12.020 --> 59:14.659
But let's talk about you.
What kind of work are you doing?

59:14.820 --> 59:16.538
What's Bigweld like?
Did you meet him?

59:16.900 --> 59:19.414
Yeah, I met him, but...

59:20.420 --> 59:21.819
What's wrong, son?

59:22.020 --> 59:25.376
It's not how we thought it was, Dad.

59:25.540 --> 59:28.259
It's not... I can't...

59:29.140 --> 59:30.459
I see.

59:30.660 --> 59:32.855
- I'm really sorry I let you down.
- No, no, no.

59:33.020 --> 59:35.693
You could never let me down, Rodney.

59:38.140 --> 59:40.893
Listen, I know it isn't easy, Rodney...

59:41.060 --> 59:43.494
...but a dream
that you don't fight for...

59:43.660 --> 59:47.096
...can haunt you
for the rest of your life.

59:48.540 --> 59:49.859
Yeah, Dad.

59:50.020 --> 59:52.170
<i>It's up to you, son.</i>

59:55.580 --> 59:58.731
- Your father loves you very much.
- I know.

59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.688
With our Friends and Family plan, you
can talk to him 500 minutes a month.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.373
Free nights and weekends.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.849
Yoo-hoo, Rodney!

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.612
Wait.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.253
- Your suitcase.
- Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I'm...

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.934
The others wanted to come
and see you off too.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.499
Well, why didn't they?

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.458
Oh, they did.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.893
Next time, let's split a cab.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.496
Who the heck is she?

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.612
I used to have a figure like that.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.975
Hurry, come on.
One ticket to anywhere.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.779
Fender?

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.658
I have a sister.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.017
An ugly sister.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.780
Hey, guess what. It's the sweepers.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.376
They're rounding up outmodes
and taking them... What "them"? Us.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.292
- to Madame Gasket's chop shop.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.099
- And guess who's really behind it all.
- Ratchet.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.689
You don't wanna guess?
I ran all this way in heels.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.339
- Come on, take a stab.
- Ratchet.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.373
Ratchet! Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:01.055
- We won't last a week.
- Okay, okay. Settle down. I got a plan.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.495
- Let's all get on that train.
- Come on.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.134
Hey, wait a minute.
You're all giving up?

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.211
- You started it.
- Well, I'm ending it.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.133
My mistake was hoping that Bigweld
would fight our battles.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.291
Well, he won't. It's up to us.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.060
If we don't do something
about Ratchet, no one will.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.898
Come on, let's fight back.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.977
Fighting never solved anything.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.694
Quitting isn't so productive either.
I gotta tell you.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.731
It's the big boy.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.896
Oh, be still, my pump.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.773
Kid, if you're gonna fight,
I'm going in with you.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.259
You... You are?

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.412
Hey, who's the dame
with the sweet keister?

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.013
- But why?
- I don't know.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.171
I'm a big guy,
and I like women with large...

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.854
No, no, no.
Why are you gonna help us?

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.217
Because I wanna grow up
to be like you.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.659
Then let's do it.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:54.809
Come on, gang. Let's give
that Ratchet an old-school fix-it!

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.217
Oh, what a man.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.335
Someone get a crane.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.258
Mother, I'm an adult, okay?

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.378
So stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.
I'm doing it today...

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.533
...how I want, where I want
and with whatever I want.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.218
Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes.
I want you both there.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.735
Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.976
No, no. You stay here...

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.052
...and watch Daddy's limo.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.012
I'm going inside to kick some booty.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.296
Hey, you know,
your boyfriend here is a genius.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.058
- What?
- Oh, he's not my... He is?

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.858
I am?

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.175
Thanks for still believing in me.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.372
It's good to be home. Toodley-oodley!

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:59.091
I use the Brazilian wax. It makes me
feel like every day's a fiesta.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.171
Tell Mr. Ratchet his 10:00 is here.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.693
I'm all over it. Yes, sir.

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.933
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.497
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.292
Oh, Mr. Bigweld.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.011
No, no. Tell him I'm not here.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.853
- Tell him anything, just don't let him in.
- Ratchet!

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.131
- I'll cut to the point.
- What happened?

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.097
Run out of dominoes?
I'll send you more.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.689
- You're fired!
- Fired? On what grounds?

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.896
This company's
never been more profitable.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.818
Profit, schmofit. Now, get out.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.853
No, wait, please listen to me.
You can't do this to me.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.818
This job is my life.
It means everything to me.

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.971
You don't know
what I've done to get here.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:50.696
The lies I've told. The lives I've ruined.
This isn't helping me.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.370
- Get me security.
- Wait, please.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.140
Can't I just make
one more heartfelt plea?

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.052
Okay, what did you wanna say?

01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.733
That.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.456
Oh, my gosh.
I'm as crazy as my mother.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.774
Take that fish to the chop shop
and put my name on his parking space.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.379
Let go of him.

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.332
Sure. Listen, kid, it's over. You lost.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.657
Bigweld is gonna be melted down
into next season's upgrades...

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:28.699
...along with you,
your moronic coffeepot and Cappy.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.652
Such a waste.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.251
Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.093
I'm the prettiest girl
at the Harvest Moon Ball.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.495
I'll take that as a "no. "

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.858
Out of the way!

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.499
Rodney.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.694
<i>Road trip! Road trip! Road trip!</i>

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.418
You guys are so embarrassing.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.139
Oh, that's Rodney.
He's in some kind of trouble.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.058
I've gotta repair him.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.529
Okay, I got your back.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.932
Come on, we've gotta help Rodney.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.300
- No, Piper, you stay here.
- No way.

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.418
Let's be honest. We're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.730
Whatever happens to us,
make something of yourself.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.337
You're the only thing
I've got to leave behind. Goodbye!

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.899
He's right, Piper.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.255
They're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.132
Okay, got it!

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.177
Rodney, what's going on?
Where are we?

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.012
It's okay. You're all right.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.095
Okay, boys, we got them
right where they want us.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.659
Boost me up.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.458
Watch your hands down there.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.530
Rodney! We're here to save you!

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.058
How do you think it's going so far?

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.615
The plug.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.732
Hold on, guys!
I gotta get to the other side.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.250
We're out of here!

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.971
The chop shop.

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.616
- That's it. Game over.
- The game is not over.

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.892
This is our moment to shine.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.938
This is where you show
what you're really made of.

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:55.778
In my case, it's a rare metal.
It's called "afraidium. "

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:58.249
It's yellow. It tastes like chicken.

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:01.652
I didn't know I could do that.

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:03.179
Rodney's right.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:08.493
I am tired of just complaining
and never doing anything.

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.173
I... I...

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.497
I wanna try.

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.053
No. Forget it. I'm sorry. No.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.371
Yes! I want to try.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.377
Then you're first.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.899
First for what?

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:27.059
They want us to upgrade?
Then let's upgrade.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.857
Gasket, you're a sick, twisted,
evil robot.

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.255
I try.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.852
Oh, good.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.658
Company.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:16.416
So you're the little glob of tin
who's been making all the trouble.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.258
Who are these losers?

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.451
- We, sir...
- I'm a woman.

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.059
Ouch.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.814
We've come to rescue our friend,
you evil bag of bolts.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.972
And you will be defeated
by the very outmodes...

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.257
...that you scorned and defaced.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:34.896
Yeah, because there's seven of us
and only one of you.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.008
There's seven of us and... Eight, nine...

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.057
- Did you count that one?
- I think so.

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.979
Could you all stop moving around?!
It's so frustrating!

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.858
I think I counted one of you twice!

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.132
While you're at it, count these.

01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:00.854
As soon as we're done with you,
these hit the streets.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:05.739
This is the last day
any outmode will ever see.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.252
Did I miss the butt-whupping?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.249
- No.
- Matter of fact, you're a little bit early.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.216
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.338
- Well, let's get started.
- Testify, sister!

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.895
- Charge!
- Charge!

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.569
<i>Oh, no! He's got a steel chair.</i>

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:06.049
<i>But he's back up into a neck-breaker.</i>

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:08.137
<i>He's up to the top rope.</i>

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.810
<i>- Look at the hang time!
- That's sure gonna leave a dent.</i>

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.730
Say hello to my dimpled friend.

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.416
This is gonna get greasy!

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:20.414
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I sure am.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.693
See a need, fill a need!

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.891
This isn't what I was thinking at all.

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.860
What are you doing? Get off me.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:58.371
Let me go! Do as I say. Get off!

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.534
Ma!

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.294
My upgrades!

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:35.490
It's all right, son.
You can shine no matter what you...

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.379
No! Just stop!

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:39.808
Come on, Rodney.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:42.733
Let's open the gates
of Bigweld Industries forever.

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:46.449
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I need to do first.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.373
Herb!

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.377
- Herb!
- Honey, what are you doing here?

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.895
- It's Rodney, honey.
- Rodney? Is he all right?

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.539
Come outside. Hurry.

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.816
Copperbottom, where are you going?

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.572
What about the dishes?

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.054
Hey, get back here!

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.859
You'll never wash in this town again.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.539
What is all this?
The whole town is out here.

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.129
- Rodney?
- Dad!

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.012
There's someone I want you to meet.

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.376
- Is that...?
- That's Bigweld, Dad...

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.656
...the greatest robot in the world.

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.418
Besides you.

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:30.818
- I understand you need a few parts.
- Well, I'm not one to complain.

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:35.258
Well, then don't. I've brought
enough parts to make two of you.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.250
Ladies and gentlebots...

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.059
...I came all this way...

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.450
Would you cut that out?
It's very distracting.

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.053
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.534
Where was I?

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.170
Mr. and Mrs. Copperbottom,
I came all this way...

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.776
...to tell you in person
that your son, Rodney...

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.416
<i>...the man who got me
off my big titanium tochis...</i>

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:03.455
...is now my right-hand bot
and my eventual successor.

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.654
Way to go, Rodney!

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.289
Oh, Mom.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.979
Son.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.413
Dad, I know you kind of felt bad
when I was growing up...

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.378
...that you couldn't give me
a lot of stuff.

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.571
But you gave me
the most important thing:

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.577
You believed in me.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:28.891
From the second you were born.

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.778
Well, Dad, now I want your dream
to come true.

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.535
Dad, you always wanted to be
a musician.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.538
Now be one, for everyone to hear.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.378
Good for you, Herb!
You did good!

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.059
- Good job!
- Way to go.

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.013
Now I'm sure I've got a heart,
because it's aching.

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.056
You'll have to forgive me.

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.535
I'm a little rusty.

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.016
Well, there goes our happy ending.

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.013
No. It's a fusion of jazz and funk.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.613
It's called "junk. "

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.896
I love you, Herb!

01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:00.291
- Fender!
- Loretta, my darling.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:02.815
Sorry.

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.059
I was on the list!

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.937
Don't you know who I am? Wait!
