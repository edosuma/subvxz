00:36.214 --> 00:39.383
You, you guys, Devon!

00:39.417 --> 00:40.551
Devon is

00:40.585 --> 00:44.255
retiring!

00:47.058 --> 00:49.159
Who the hell is Devon?

00:49.194 --> 00:51.262
Who the...?

00:53.999 --> 00:55.340
He's our mailman.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.201
The only man who's delivered mail

00:57.235 --> 00:59.586
to this house for my entire life.

00:59.696 --> 01:03.366
His shorts were always
the harbinger of summer!

01:05.902 --> 01:07.470
I could kill you right now.

01:07.504 --> 01:09.572
Weren't you supposed to quit
crying for New Year's?

01:11.241 --> 01:12.875
I'm sensitive!

01:12.909 --> 01:15.044
It's a desirable trait in some cultures.

01:15.078 --> 01:17.480
In France, maybe...
Oh, my God! Move to France!

01:17.514 --> 01:19.281
Go. The hell. To France!

01:19.316 --> 01:22.118
Stan, you were supposed to give
up yelling for New Year's.

01:22.152 --> 01:23.719
But I love yelling!

01:23.754 --> 01:25.421
It feels good and it's good for you.

01:25.455 --> 01:27.390
That's why Sam Kinison lived so long.

01:29.092 --> 01:31.160
I swear to God, you two.

01:31.194 --> 01:33.562
Uh, Mom? Weren't you
supposed to give up smoking?

01:34.965 --> 01:37.633
Yeah, well, you were
supposed to give up junk food.

01:39.770 --> 01:41.904
Ah, it's okay, Mrs. S.

01:41.938 --> 01:44.473
And you were supposed to give up hugs!

01:44.508 --> 01:47.343
Is it such a flaw that
I want to hug everyone I see?

01:47.377 --> 01:49.445
If you're not a Special
Olympian, then yes.

01:49.479 --> 01:52.114
This family sucks.

01:52.149 --> 01:54.784
We never do anything
we say we're gonna do.

01:54.818 --> 01:57.019
Just look at the
popsicle stick White House

01:57.054 --> 01:59.055
we started six years ago.

02:00.991 --> 02:02.825
Mmm, popsicles.

02:02.859 --> 02:05.594
Hey, let's all quit our jobs
and buy an ice cream truck.

02:05.629 --> 02:07.463
Just drive around, making kids happy.

02:07.497 --> 02:09.431
That's a great idea!
We are totally doing this!

02:09.466 --> 02:11.333
I'm a kid!
I'll Google it tomorrow.

02:11.368 --> 02:12.835
See what a truck would cost.

02:12.869 --> 02:14.710
Or maybe the next day.
Tomorrow's kind of busy.

02:14.738 --> 02:16.505
Gosh, it sounds really complicated.

02:16.540 --> 02:17.974
You know what? We tried.
Let's just forget it.

02:17.975 --> 02:19.408
Yeah, I don't really care.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.843
I don't know what we were thinking.

02:20.877 --> 02:22.311
Yeah, good idea, not a good idea.

02:22.345 --> 02:24.080
Mardi Gras, bitches!

02:24.114 --> 02:25.815
I'm having a party at my bar.

02:25.849 --> 02:29.251
I got beads aplenty,
so I want to see all your tatas!

02:29.286 --> 02:31.921
Except you, Hayley.
You have the worst boobs.

02:31.955 --> 02:33.789
They're like 90% nips.

02:33.824 --> 02:36.559
Like two dark castles
with tiny little moats.

02:40.430 --> 02:42.298
Mardi Gras.

02:42.332 --> 02:44.233
That means Lent starts tomorrow!

02:44.267 --> 02:46.702
This is our chance
to give up our vices again!

02:46.736 --> 02:48.003
What the hell is Lent?

02:48.038 --> 02:51.173
Lent is the period
between Mardi Gras and Easter.

02:51.208 --> 02:53.909
It's a time of prayer and introspection.

02:53.944 --> 02:56.712
People give up things
for the 40 days of Lent

02:56.746 --> 03:00.883
to get closer to God
or remember Jesus' sacrifice.

03:00.917 --> 03:02.797
♪ No-no-no-no-no-no-no!

03:02.819 --> 03:04.086
♪ No-no-no-no-no-no!

03:04.121 --> 03:05.988
♪ No-no-no-no!

03:06.022 --> 03:10.025
I don't appreciate you tainting
my booby holiday with God stuff.

03:11.695 --> 03:13.729
Come on, guys.
What do you say?

03:13.763 --> 03:15.898
Let's give it another try for Lent.

03:15.932 --> 03:16.999
No yelling.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.300
No crying.

03:18.335 --> 03:19.568
No junk food.

03:19.603 --> 03:20.736
No hugs.

03:20.770 --> 03:22.371
And I'll quit smoking.

03:22.405 --> 03:24.773
And we'll really follow through
this time.

03:24.808 --> 03:26.308
I don't know.
Too hard.

03:26.343 --> 03:28.210
Not into it.
I do what she says.

03:28.245 --> 03:29.979
Okay, fine.

03:30.013 --> 03:32.715
If you do this, I'll let everyone

03:32.749 --> 03:35.651
get pee-in-their-pants drunk
at Roger's Mardi Gras.

03:35.685 --> 03:37.119
Yeah!

03:37.154 --> 03:39.421
Let's get in line so
we're the first ones there!

03:40.624 --> 03:42.625
Deputy Director Bullock?
What are you doing here?

03:42.659 --> 03:43.726
Are you kidding me?

03:43.760 --> 03:46.195
I hear this is
the best party of the year.

03:46.229 --> 03:48.297
What the hell, Avery?
You didn't save my place?

03:48.331 --> 03:50.432
I've been waiting with you
for, like, three days.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.536
When you went off to get your
Frito Pie, I had time to think.

03:53.570 --> 03:57.540
And my thought was I hate you.

03:57.574 --> 03:58.674
<i>Treme!</i>

03:58.708 --> 03:59.542
<i>Etouffée!</i>

03:59.576 --> 04:00.543
Beignet!

04:00.577 --> 04:01.443
You're gay!

04:01.478 --> 04:02.778
Hooray!
Hooray!

04:02.812 --> 04:04.813
Last chance to get our vices out.

04:08.418 --> 04:11.120
Oh, I'm gonna miss crying so much.

04:11.154 --> 04:13.255
Am I drunk?
What's in this cake?

04:13.290 --> 04:15.958
Rum! It's also
in this needle.

04:19.296 --> 04:22.965
Another shot! The Prince
of Mardi Gras demands it!

04:22.999 --> 04:25.201
I'm yelling!

04:25.235 --> 04:28.771
So do you and Greg plan
to give up butt play for Lent?

04:28.805 --> 04:30.973
Um, we don't consider that a vice.

04:31.007 --> 04:32.341
It's an act of love.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.643
Ah, well, there's the difference then.

04:34.678 --> 04:36.812
I'm giving it up for sure.

04:44.454 --> 04:45.688
Oo-ho!

04:45.722 --> 04:47.656
I fell in love last night, Klaus.

04:47.691 --> 04:50.659
Tell me everything...
No! Tell me the highlights.

04:50.694 --> 04:52.161
It was magical.

04:52.195 --> 04:54.930
She had breasts like
I've never seen before.

04:54.965 --> 04:57.132
We danced all night,
but when midnight came,

04:57.167 --> 04:59.001
she ran off before I could get her name.

04:59.035 --> 05:00.536
You were smashed, man.

05:00.570 --> 05:02.504
You kept high-fiving
that black guy.

05:02.539 --> 05:04.707
He was not into it.

05:07.244 --> 05:09.845
Klaus, this pastie...
It's hers...

05:09.879 --> 05:11.213
She was wearing it!

05:11.248 --> 05:13.582
The most perfect bosom I've ever seen

05:13.617 --> 05:15.484
wore this pastie last night!

05:15.518 --> 05:17.853
I have to find the booby
that fits this pastie

05:17.887 --> 05:19.722
so I can spend the rest of my life

05:19.756 --> 05:21.390
happily ever after with its owner.

05:21.424 --> 05:23.392
Ooh, maybe she'll have a friend.

05:23.426 --> 05:25.661
Yeah, and I'm sure
she'll want to get with a fish.

05:25.695 --> 05:28.063
Look, you got to start
being more realistic, okay?

05:28.098 --> 05:29.665
Now grab your heralding trumpet

05:29.699 --> 05:31.567
and meet me in the pumpkin carriage.

05:34.604 --> 05:36.972
I don't feel that hung over.

05:37.007 --> 05:39.508
Guess I can handle my alcohol
better than you guys.

05:39.542 --> 05:40.843
Oh, yeah?

05:40.877 --> 05:44.013
Pubic hair and mayonnaise ice cream.

05:49.052 --> 05:52.021
Hey! That guy... that guy's
gonna get a piece of my mind.

05:53.089 --> 05:54.757
He's got glasses.

05:54.791 --> 05:56.825
I'm gonna call him a nerd.
Gonna start with that...

05:56.860 --> 05:59.194
Stan. Remember, you're
giving up yelling for Lent.

05:59.229 --> 06:01.430
Look, we're doing this

06:01.464 --> 06:05.000
and we're all gonna stick
with it this time, right, guys?

06:05.035 --> 06:06.402
Bleah!

06:07.470 --> 06:09.805
Whoa, look at that?

06:09.839 --> 06:11.240
Whoa...

06:14.811 --> 06:17.579
American Dad <i>cares.</i>

06:19.416 --> 06:20.816
Francine, maybe we'll all just give up

06:20.850 --> 06:22.318
making you happy for Lent.

06:22.352 --> 06:23.452
Would that make you happy?

06:23.486 --> 06:25.154
Smiths! Good Lent to you!

06:25.188 --> 06:26.822
How are the sacrifices going?

06:26.856 --> 06:28.691
Yeah, it turns out
we're gonna blow that off.

06:28.725 --> 06:31.694
Hmm. I'm afraid that wouldn't
be in your best interest.

06:31.728 --> 06:33.595
You made a deal with me last night

06:33.630 --> 06:35.731
to make sure I help you follow through.

06:35.765 --> 06:37.833
Like you give a rat's ass
what anyone does.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.802
You've stolen babies and sold them

06:39.836 --> 06:41.036
to underground dinner clubs.

06:41.071 --> 06:44.106
How dare you That was pillow talk!

06:44.140 --> 06:47.943
Oh, I'll admit it:
I'm a degenerate.

06:47.977 --> 06:50.112
I love drugs and drinking and gambling,

06:50.146 --> 06:54.016
and my moral compass
always points <i>south...</i>

06:54.050 --> 06:56.085
Yeah...!

06:56.119 --> 06:57.319
But during Lent I repent

06:57.354 --> 06:59.388
and that makes up
for the rest of the year.

06:59.422 --> 07:01.423
This year my Lenten promise

07:01.458 --> 07:04.760
is making sure you keep
your Lenten promises.

07:04.794 --> 07:07.229
You all agreed.
You signed a contract.

07:07.263 --> 07:08.664
What contract?

07:08.698 --> 07:10.766
Ah, yes, you were quite drunk.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.701
I was afraid you may not remember,

07:12.736 --> 07:15.204
so I documented everything.

07:16.773 --> 07:19.675
While this loads, did you guys
ever think of this?

07:19.709 --> 07:24.546
Sylvester Stallone's name is Sylvester.

07:24.581 --> 07:27.716
Habet Bullock <i>cultro.</i>

07:27.751 --> 07:31.019
<i>Si non sequitur meo per votum...</i>

07:31.054 --> 07:35.224
My man! Up top! My dog!
<i>...ego Lenten anathema seseque digitum.</i>

07:35.258 --> 07:37.292
That contract you signed says

07:37.327 --> 07:41.363
I get to cut off a finger of
the first person who cracks.

07:41.398 --> 07:42.831
You're full of it.

07:42.866 --> 07:44.866
You're not really going
to cut off anyone's finger.

07:46.936 --> 07:48.203
Ew, gross!

07:48.238 --> 07:51.774
Yes. I started collecting
when I was in Vietnam.

07:51.808 --> 07:53.275
Two summers ago.

07:53.309 --> 07:55.544
I was on a sex tour.
Did not get laid.

07:55.578 --> 07:57.112
Had zero game.

07:57.147 --> 07:58.647
Just kept...

07:58.681 --> 08:00.182
cutting off fingers.

08:06.245 --> 08:07.713
You want to cut off our fingers?!

08:07.747 --> 08:08.964
One finger.

08:09.084 --> 08:11.216
The finger of the first person

08:11.250 --> 08:12.984
who doesn't keep their Lenten promise.

08:13.019 --> 08:15.153
I hope it's the boy.
Why?!

08:15.188 --> 08:17.222
I envy your youth!

08:17.256 --> 08:20.459
Hey, hey, come on.
This a good thing.

08:20.493 --> 08:24.296
This is our chance to finally
follow through on something.

08:24.330 --> 08:26.698
And now there are real consequences

08:26.733 --> 08:28.366
if someone slips up.

08:28.401 --> 08:30.435
I've installed cameras
all over your house

08:30.470 --> 08:31.803
to track your every move.

08:33.005 --> 08:34.972
And not to worry, Francine.

08:35.006 --> 08:38.909
There are no minicameras
in your tampons, so...

08:38.945 --> 08:41.446
all good to go there.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:51.157 --> 08:54.192
Make way for the Prince of Mardi Gras!

08:54.227 --> 08:56.194
My good man, I'm looking for the maiden

08:56.229 --> 08:59.498
who fits this pastie
so I may maketh her my wife.

08:59.532 --> 09:01.299
Uh-huh...

09:01.334 --> 09:03.835
None of my girls
wear anything like this.

09:03.870 --> 09:06.671
But there is one stripper here
who may be able to help you.

09:06.706 --> 09:08.840
She's been in the business for decades.

09:08.875 --> 09:12.077
Ooh, she's wise as ass.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.084
Fair one.

09:19.118 --> 09:22.420
It is rumored you know
of all things stripper.

09:24.157 --> 09:27.325
This is not the pastie of a stripper.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.161
It's handmade.

09:29.195 --> 09:33.832
This pastie belonged to a civilian.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.634
Thank you, wise one.

09:35.668 --> 09:37.569
A hay-penny
for your troubles.

09:46.712 --> 09:50.048
Plinko!

09:54.787 --> 09:57.355
Ah, nothing like a nice movie night

09:57.390 --> 10:00.225
to take our minds off Lent, huh, gang?

10:00.259 --> 10:01.359
Let's see what we got...

10:01.394 --> 10:02.861
Oh, <i>Lucas!</i>

10:02.895 --> 10:04.396
Nope, that'll make me cry.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.597
Okay. <i>Field of Dreams.</i>

10:05.631 --> 10:07.833
No way. Hits
too close to home.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.868
I was never close to my father.

10:11.771 --> 10:14.773
Do you have to eat that junk food

10:14.807 --> 10:16.274
right in front of my face?

10:16.309 --> 10:18.009
I need it so I don't smoke.

10:18.044 --> 10:19.277
Nope.

10:19.312 --> 10:20.512
Nope.

10:20.546 --> 10:24.216
Steve, please, kindly,
please find a movie

10:24.250 --> 10:26.918
and stop flipping channels
before I wring the last breath

10:26.953 --> 10:29.387
out of your very, very,
very annoying body.

10:29.422 --> 10:30.989
Thank you very much. Thanks.

10:31.023 --> 10:33.325
Ugh, I can't be near that popcorn.

10:33.359 --> 10:35.393
Just get it out of my face!

10:37.797 --> 10:39.264
Well done, Hayley!

10:39.298 --> 10:40.665
Throw out the temptation.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.834
Throw out the devil in all of you.

10:42.869 --> 10:45.370
Mr. Bullock, sir!
Please, let us off the hook.

10:45.404 --> 10:47.472
I know it's difficult, young man.

10:47.506 --> 10:50.342
Of course, if you'd rather
I just take a finger

10:50.376 --> 10:53.778
from one of you,
that will satisfy our contract.

10:54.881 --> 10:57.349
Oh, and I was watching the shower cam.

10:57.383 --> 10:58.917
Jeff, quick question:

10:58.951 --> 11:01.586
Why do you only shave
your left goose egg?

11:01.621 --> 11:05.223
I'm doing it now too, and
I want to know the reason why.

11:07.727 --> 11:09.027
Okay, Mrs. Simmons,

11:09.061 --> 11:11.563
if you'll step away
from the mammogram machine,

11:11.597 --> 11:13.732
I have one more important test.

11:13.766 --> 11:16.234
All right, sir, I said
you could try three nipples

11:16.269 --> 11:17.903
and then you'd have to go.

11:17.937 --> 11:18.870
Fine.

11:18.905 --> 11:20.906
But as long as I'm here...

11:22.575 --> 11:24.843
Your breasts are full of spiders!

11:24.877 --> 11:25.844
Perfect!

11:25.878 --> 11:27.245
That's the way I like 'em.

11:29.782 --> 11:32.517
Hey, how's Daddy's little trooper?

11:32.551 --> 11:33.852
This sucks, Dad.

11:33.886 --> 11:35.020
I know, kiddo.

11:35.054 --> 11:37.022
Listen, I get that this is hard for you,

11:37.056 --> 11:39.090
but you're such a sweet, good boy.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.767
That's why I want you to let
Bullock take your finger.

11:41.768 --> 11:42.427
What?!

11:42.461 --> 11:44.262
You heard him--
as soon as he gets his finger,

11:44.297 --> 11:45.931
he'll leave, and we'll
all be off the hook.

11:45.965 --> 11:48.300
So just give up and let
him have your finger.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.467
For me.

11:49.502 --> 11:50.635
For Papa.

11:50.670 --> 11:51.636
Forget it, man.

11:51.671 --> 11:53.371
Okay, we're at an impasse.

11:53.406 --> 11:54.873
But someone in this house

11:54.907 --> 11:56.875
has to crack and give
Bullock their finger

11:56.909 --> 11:58.276
because not being able to yell

11:58.311 --> 12:00.779
is giving me very tiny hard poops.

12:00.813 --> 12:02.247
<i>Babe, where's my hat?</i>

12:02.281 --> 12:03.548
<i>You're wearing it.</i>

12:05.651 --> 12:07.552
Of course, the moron!

12:07.586 --> 12:09.421
The moron.

12:15.127 --> 12:16.261
Jeff.

12:16.295 --> 12:17.429
Mr. S.

12:17.463 --> 12:19.230
Jeff.

12:19.265 --> 12:20.231
Jeffrey.

12:20.266 --> 12:21.833
I don't think I tell you enough

12:21.867 --> 12:24.002
how honored I am
to have you in my family.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.003
Really?

12:25.037 --> 12:26.871
I just wish there was some physical way

12:26.906 --> 12:28.907
I could express our familial closeness.

12:28.941 --> 12:30.241
Oh, Mr. S....

12:30.276 --> 12:32.444
I love you, Jeff Fischer.

12:32.478 --> 12:34.612
Meet love halfway, Jeff.

12:34.647 --> 12:35.947
Babe, no!

12:35.982 --> 12:37.849
You're in pre-hug!

12:37.883 --> 12:39.751
They're trying to sabotage you!

12:39.785 --> 12:41.886
Well, two can play at that game.

12:41.921 --> 12:45.957
Obama has done amazing things
with health care.

12:45.992 --> 12:49.094

13:37.510 --> 13:40.078
What is wrong with you people?

13:40.112 --> 13:42.714
Lent is only 37 more days.

13:44.250 --> 13:47.285
People are stressing me out,
and I can't smoke,

13:47.319 --> 13:50.455
so I'm gonna go sit on the dryer
and think about Stamos.

13:52.658 --> 13:54.325
What are we gonna do, Dad?

13:54.360 --> 13:56.161
I don't think we can make it.

13:56.195 --> 13:57.529
We'll be fine.

13:57.563 --> 13:59.297
Besides, what's the worst
that could happen?

14:01.434 --> 14:04.569
Hey gang, I'm ho... ly moly!

14:14.847 --> 14:18.149
I just wanted us to be a good family.

14:18.184 --> 14:21.653
Sorry, I didn't mean to make it
sound like I was blaming you.

14:32.598 --> 14:34.399
Ha-ha!
Gotcha!

14:34.433 --> 14:36.201
I don't understand.

14:36.235 --> 14:37.936
Trickery! Steve's guts?

14:37.970 --> 14:40.472
A simple garden hose
covered in hot sauce!

14:40.506 --> 14:43.308
What?! Why would you do that?!

14:43.342 --> 14:45.477
So you'd break,
and we could end all this.

14:45.511 --> 14:46.811
After all, it was you

14:46.846 --> 14:49.214
who dragged us into this
in the first place.

14:49.248 --> 14:52.417
Oh, did I miss a hot sauce
and hose party?

14:52.451 --> 14:55.019
Francine!

14:55.054 --> 14:56.654
Are you smoking?!

14:56.689 --> 14:59.124
Looks like I'm cutting off your finger.

14:59.158 --> 15:01.326
Just one finger
from whoever cracked first.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.727
That was the deal, right?

15:02.761 --> 15:03.695
Right-o!

15:03.729 --> 15:05.230
We're free!

15:08.067 --> 15:09.267
So good.

15:11.437 --> 15:13.838
Mmm. Mmm.

15:13.873 --> 15:16.174
Stop flipping channels yesterday!

15:19.912 --> 15:22.881
So, Francine, which finger shall I take?

15:22.915 --> 15:25.016
This one.

15:25.050 --> 15:29.154
Ooh, that is a hard burn on you, Smiths.

15:36.158 --> 15:37.673
All right then, I'm off to the kitchen

15:37.793 --> 15:39.106
to set up the ceremony,

15:39.226 --> 15:41.933
and then we'll chop
your pinky off in two shakes.

15:45.398 --> 15:47.132
Francine, you're shaking like a leaf.

15:47.167 --> 15:48.967
Do you <i>not</i> want to do this?

15:49.002 --> 15:52.004
It's okay. I have a plan
to get you out of here.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.306
We're not gonna let Bullock
cut off your finger.

15:54.340 --> 15:56.708
Okay, huddle up.

15:56.743 --> 15:57.876
Okay, here's the plan.

15:57.911 --> 15:59.344
We peel out of the driveway,

15:59.379 --> 16:01.246
hit the freeway and head for the border.

16:01.281 --> 16:03.015
But hold on, Francine.
Here comes Bullock.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.883
Oh, man, he's in a Lamborghini.

16:04.918 --> 16:06.151
Jeff, toss me the Uzi.

16:06.186 --> 16:07.352
Oh, no, I forgot it.

16:07.387 --> 16:09.855
You idiot! Then
we'll have to lose him.

16:09.889 --> 16:11.623
I'm gonna drive straight into the mall!

16:11.658 --> 16:13.192
Not through the puppy store!

16:13.226 --> 16:16.995
Stop! Stan, I'm not
running away from this.

16:17.030 --> 16:18.163
Mwa?

16:18.198 --> 16:19.832
We made a promise to Bullock,

16:19.866 --> 16:21.700
and for once in our lives,

16:21.734 --> 16:24.236
we're going to be a family
that follows through.

16:24.270 --> 16:26.438
I'm letting him take my finger.

16:30.143 --> 16:31.677
I got to warn you guys.

16:31.711 --> 16:33.979
I get real faint at the sight of blood.

16:34.013 --> 16:38.016
What?! You?! No!

16:40.553 --> 16:43.188
Have you ever seen a sad prince, Klaus?

16:43.223 --> 16:45.791
Well, Prince Charles
was pretty devastated when...

16:45.825 --> 16:47.759
I'm the saddest prince there is

16:47.794 --> 16:50.762
because I cannot find my true love.

16:50.797 --> 16:52.664
But hark!

16:52.699 --> 16:55.567
Upon what hopeful vision
does my royal gaze fall?

16:59.939 --> 17:01.506
Klaus, my liege,

17:01.541 --> 17:04.209
it appears we may be nearing
the end of our quest.

17:04.243 --> 17:07.012
I can't stop thinking about
those spiders in your boobies.

17:14.153 --> 17:16.788
Good sir, 'tis I,
the Prince of Mardi Gras.

17:16.823 --> 17:19.558
Be there any fair maidens
in this cottage?

17:19.592 --> 17:20.858
Why, yes, indeed.

17:20.894 --> 17:23.127
I have three
uniquely-breasted daughters,

17:23.162 --> 17:25.631
and they all went
to your Mardi Gras ball.

17:25.665 --> 17:29.101
The prince is here to see
all the bosoms in the house!

17:29.135 --> 17:31.536
Oh! The prince!
He's here!

17:31.571 --> 17:33.305
Father, Father, try my bitty first.

17:33.339 --> 17:35.474
No, mine.
Try mine.

17:35.508 --> 17:37.576
It'll fit <i>me.</i>
I just know it.

17:56.129 --> 17:58.363
But the crest
and the fairy tale cottage.

17:58.398 --> 18:01.500
Are you sure there are not
any other maidens in the house?

18:01.534 --> 18:03.101
Well, I do have a stepdaughter,

18:03.136 --> 18:05.103
but it couldn't possibly be her.

18:05.138 --> 18:07.572
She was not <i>permitted</i>
to go to the party.

18:07.607 --> 18:09.274
She was busy doing chores.

18:16.249 --> 18:18.984
Oh, my God, now I remember.

18:19.018 --> 18:20.452
It's you!

18:20.486 --> 18:22.721
You're the girl of my dreams!

18:36.636 --> 18:39.738
I wish we could live
inside this song forever.

18:46.045 --> 18:47.746
I did it, daughters.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.548
I married her off.

18:49.582 --> 18:51.583
And to a prince, no less.

18:53.319 --> 18:57.489
We're just gonna let that guy
and his fish take our cow?

19:08.167 --> 19:11.837
Are you ready, Francine,
to pay for your sins?

19:11.871 --> 19:13.338
I am.

19:13.373 --> 19:16.875
Francine, you have broken
your contract with God.

19:16.909 --> 19:18.977
Your family was true to their word,

19:19.012 --> 19:21.947
so fully-fingered
they shall remain.

19:21.981 --> 19:23.548
Oh.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.851
Oh. Oh.

19:25.885 --> 19:28.086
Francine, you are weak.

19:28.121 --> 19:29.354
You are a failure.

19:29.389 --> 19:31.289
You are...
the very worst.

19:31.324 --> 19:32.457
No!

19:32.492 --> 19:33.625
She's innocent!

19:33.659 --> 19:35.193
Take my finger instead.

19:35.228 --> 19:36.928
No, I'm the worst!
Take mine.

19:36.963 --> 19:38.230
Take my whole hand!

19:38.264 --> 19:40.832
Take my hairy right goose egg!

19:40.867 --> 19:43.502
My God.

19:43.536 --> 19:46.905
Smiths, what a heroic display.

19:46.939 --> 19:49.741
A family coming together
to save their matriarch.

19:49.776 --> 19:52.911
This sacrifice is
the true spirit of Lent.

19:52.945 --> 19:56.982
I hereby absolve you
from any further sacrifice.

20:02.455 --> 20:04.656
Well, I get to keep my finger,

20:04.690 --> 20:07.692
but we broke another promise.

20:09.929 --> 20:12.064
Francine, you were right.

20:12.098 --> 20:13.899
We promised a finger, and for once,

20:13.933 --> 20:15.767
this family is following through.

20:15.802 --> 20:18.470
Welp, down to seven fingers.

20:18.504 --> 20:20.639
Oh, Stan, we did it!

20:20.673 --> 20:22.674
We finally don't suck.

20:22.708 --> 20:24.576
I love you.

20:24.610 --> 20:26.745
Let me tourniquet
that, Mr. S.

20:30.416 --> 20:33.919
And so, Smiths, you have truly
seen the message of Lent,

20:33.953 --> 20:37.089
and that is, if you want to please God,

20:37.123 --> 20:40.292
give up something for 40 days,
or cut off a finger,

20:40.326 --> 20:42.861
then go right back to drinking, cursing,

20:42.895 --> 20:45.897
pillaging, raping, and doing cocaine.

20:45.932 --> 20:49.167
My work here is done!

20:56.153 --> 20:58.545
I built this in your house.
