02:50.137 --> 02:51.866
Oh, wasn't that great?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.440
That was our own velvet cloud,
Potsie Weber,

02:54.574 --> 02:56.702
wrapping up
this afternoon's festivities.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.971
But before you go,
we have a special announcement

02:59.112 --> 03:00.808
from Al Delvecchio,

03:00.947 --> 03:04.213
the man who made indigestion
a household word.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.648
AL:
Oh, Richie.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.117
RICHIE:
We're just kidding you, Al.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.780
Okay, I just want to say
that for the next two weeks,

03:09.923 --> 03:13.382
Arnold's will be closed
because I'm going to California

03:13.527 --> 03:16.690
to visit my cousin Josephine.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.322
She's the one who introduced me
to Rosa Coletti.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.900
Did I ever tell you
about Rosa Col...?

03:21.034 --> 03:22.229
Al, Al, not now.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.996
Ju-Just tell 'em about
the Blue Ox Inn, will you?

03:24.137 --> 03:25.002
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Right.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.231
Now, if you want
to have some fun

03:26.373 --> 03:29.399
when we're closed here,
you know, this weekend

03:29.543 --> 03:32.706
Leather Tuscadero and the Suedes
will be appearing

03:32.846 --> 03:34.507
at the Blue Ox Inn.

03:34.648 --> 03:38.084
Now, that's about 80 miles north
on Highway 41, thank you.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.619
Oh, uh, well, now...
(laughs)

03:40.754 --> 03:41.653
Don't forget that backing up

03:41.788 --> 03:43.848
Leather and the Suedes
will be us.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.222
(laughs)
We...

03:47.360 --> 03:50.023
The-the band. We're gonna...

03:50.163 --> 03:52.826
(grunts)

03:52.966 --> 03:54.900
They never applaud.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.366
AL:
You really should get a name.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.368
Yeah.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.528
Where's Fonzie?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.663
He went to buy
some camping equipment.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.504
You know, the Fonz has been
acting awfully tense lately.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.373
Well, yeah, he's tense,
but we're going north

04:05.512 --> 04:08.641
to play the Blue Ox Inn,
not Yellowstone Park.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.272
You know, he's taking Blossom.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.146
The Bunny
from Happy Harry's Hutch?

04:12.285 --> 04:14.379
- Yeah, yeah.
- RICHIE: Ah.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.750
- She's relaxing.
- POTSIE AND RALPH: Yeah!

04:16.890 --> 04:18.016
Well, I'm gonna go get my girl.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.683
You know, we were supposed
to have a date tonight.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.055
You guys mind packing up
the instruments?

04:21.194 --> 04:22.457
- Sure. -Nah, we'll pack
up the instruments.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.223
We always pack up
the instruments.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.661
How are you gonna pack a piano?

04:25.799 --> 04:27.927
In a big suitcase.
(laughs)

04:28.068 --> 04:29.865
(laughter)

04:30.003 --> 04:32.165
(laughs)

04:32.305 --> 04:33.534
(clears throat)
Lori Beth?

04:33.673 --> 04:35.266
I'm free to dance at last.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.842
You really want to dance?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.035
Yeah, I want to dance.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.146
I've been looking forward to it
all night long.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.941
Yeah, I've been up there
playing all night, you know?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.447
I've got the rhythm in my feet.
I've got to go.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.176
Okay, okay.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.412
But I'm really tired.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.683
Oh, yeah, well,
sure you're tired.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.292
Why wouldn't you be tired?

04:52.425 --> 04:54.291
You've been dancing
with every guy in the place.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.861
It wasn't every guy.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.520
You said I could dance
while you played.

04:57.664 --> 04:58.893
Yeah, I said you could dance.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.933
But not with a partner.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.230
All right, now,
come on, come on.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.932
I'd like to, but I have
to go meet Herbie Root.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.770
Herbie Root?

05:09.910 --> 05:12.879
He broke up with Belinda, and I
promised her I'd talk with him.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.310
Oh, come on,
talk to him tomorrow.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.177
I can't. He's waiting. He's...

05:16.316 --> 05:18.045
I can't leave him standing
on the street corner.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.880
You can't leave me
standing at Arnold's!

05:20.020 --> 05:21.214
Criminy!

05:21.354 --> 05:23.186
Can we talk about it later?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.984
Yeah, you bet we'll talk
about this later.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.093
Tomorrow, okay? I'll meet you
right here a half hour

05:27.227 --> 05:28.217
before we go to the roadhouse.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.091
All right, you'd better be here.

05:30.230 --> 05:33.063
And you'd better be ready to do
some fast talking, woman!

05:33.200 --> 05:35.566
(all cheer)

05:37.470 --> 05:38.904
JOANIE: What are you reading,
Peyton Place?

05:39.039 --> 05:40.131
No, dear.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.537
<i>It's called Feminine Mystique.</i>

05:42.676 --> 05:44.542
- Hmm.
- You know, Joanie?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.704
Men have been taking advantage
of us for too long now.

05:47.847 --> 05:48.712
Huh!

05:48.848 --> 05:49.907
You're telling me.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.746
David makes me pay for my sodas.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.718
Well, that's good.
See, that's good.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.323
Women should be allowed
to pay for their own sodas.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.755
They should be free
to do what they want to.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.486
Well, I want to be free

06:01.628 --> 06:03.858
to make David pay for my sodas.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.431
Hello, dear.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.430
Hi, Rich. Bye.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.399
Hi, Joanie. Bye.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.596
We're getting closer and closer
all the time.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.207
Richard?

06:14.341 --> 06:15.808
- Lori Beth called for you.
- Mm-hmm?

06:15.942 --> 06:19.208
We had a very nice chat and
I think you're being a stinker.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.836
- A stinker?
- Yes.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.142
Me? Did she tell you that?

06:23.283 --> 06:25.149
Bet she's been saying
that all over town.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.947
Well, the way you treated her,
it's a wonder that she isn't.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.578
What? The way I treated her?!

06:29.723 --> 06:31.281
Mom, I invited her
up to the Blue Ox Inn.

06:31.424 --> 06:32.790
- And then she starts going...
- Hello, Howard.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.189
Hello, loved ones.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.317
Daddy's home.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.691
What's for dinner, sweetheart?

06:36.830 --> 06:37.888
Hi, Dad.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.090
- Richard.
- Mom, what you don't realize is,

06:40.233 --> 06:42.463
she's so busy being friendly
to every guy around,

06:42.602 --> 06:44.127
she has no time at all for me.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.795
Eh, dinner, Marion?

06:45.939 --> 06:48.772
Well, you can have
whatever's on the menu, dear.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.673
It's Lori Beth's life, dear.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.939
She has every right to do
whatever she wants with it.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.243
Menu? We have a menu now?

06:57.384 --> 06:58.612
What about me, Mom?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.242
I'm a person, too.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.651
Uh, no menu here, Howard.
We're going out for dinner.

07:02.789 --> 07:06.157
Richard, Richard,
women, women aren't puppets.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.124
It's, uh, chapter eight.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.422
I never called
Lori Beth a puppet.

07:09.562 --> 07:10.791
Did you ever hear me
use the word "puppet"?

07:10.930 --> 07:13.456
What have puppets
got to do with dinner?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.660
Oh, Howard, I am reading
the most interesting book.

07:16.803 --> 07:20.364
Marion, did you bring home
a puppet cookbook?

07:20.507 --> 07:21.633
No, no, dear.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.039
No, this is called
Feminine Mystique.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.702
And it says in here
that it's time

07:25.845 --> 07:28.508
that women stopped letting men
take advantage of them.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.207
Lori Beth has been taking
advantage of me.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.681
She's the stinker, Mom.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.843
Aw, boy!

07:33.987 --> 07:36.752
HOWARD:
Oh, I'm a little confused.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.517
I guess
I've been working too hard.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.025
Listen, we'll discuss this
while you're making dinner.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.823
Did you hear that, Richard?

07:43.963 --> 07:46.592
Men are not the only ones

07:46.733 --> 07:48.462
who work hard,
Howard Cunningham.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.695
After I fix your breakfast
in the morning,

07:50.837 --> 07:53.204
who do you think clears
the table and washes the dishes

07:53.340 --> 07:54.967
and scrubs the floor in there?

07:55.108 --> 07:57.668
And dusts and vacuums and,
and does the laundry,

07:57.811 --> 08:00.575
irons your shirts
and mends your socks?

08:00.714 --> 08:02.011
And then chauffeurs
Joanie around?

08:02.148 --> 08:04.708
And that does the shopping,
and then starts all over again

08:04.851 --> 08:07.081
so she can have dinner for you
when you come home

08:07.220 --> 08:09.018
from hanging around
the hardware store all day?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.455
Who, Howard? Who?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.861
I got a terrific idea.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.628
Let's go out to dinner, Marion.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.898
I'll get my coat.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.238
<i>RALPH: All right, all we got
to do is pack the car.</i>

08:29.376 --> 08:30.866
Yeah, they already have
a piano up there.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.501
No kidding?

08:32.645 --> 08:35.046
I thought I was gonna have
to carry it up on my key chain.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.477
-(both laugh)
- Good one.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.515
How's that, Ralph?

08:37.650 --> 08:39.881
Not bad, Chachi,
you almost got it now.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.284
Boy, I can't wait
till the Blue Ox Inn tonight.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.447
Roadhouse girls!

08:44.591 --> 08:47.890
Pots, stick with me,
the old Malph charm.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.723
The girls are gonna
be begging to be with us.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.854
All right.

08:54.968 --> 08:55.832
- Hey, Fonz.
- Hey, Fonz.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.937
All right, let's break camp.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.597
I'm ready to go and, uh, commune
with nature right here.

09:00.740 --> 09:01.935
You know what I mean?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.372
Meet Mother Nature
and everything.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.977
I got me one of these,
I'm ready to rough it.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.636
That-That's all you got, Fonz?

09:06.780 --> 09:07.747
Just a knife?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.212
What are you talking about,
a knife?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.476
This is a fork, it's a spoon.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.710
There's several bottle openers.

09:12.852 --> 09:13.910
I got a saw in here.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.578
I could build myself a raft.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.281
It's got scissors.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.984
And-and somewhere in here is
a roll of bathroom tissue,

09:20.126 --> 09:21.184
I'm sure.

09:21.327 --> 09:22.590
No kidding?

09:22.729 --> 09:23.923
Let's see.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.929
It was a joke, Potsie.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.728
Don't you understand humor?

09:28.868 --> 09:30.063
What's happening to me?

09:30.203 --> 09:31.329
You see that?

09:31.471 --> 09:33.064
I'm all tensed up
and everything like that.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.106
It's 'cause I played
with too many small motors.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.538
I got to get out of here.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.907
I got to meet Mother Nature
face-to-face, you know?

09:40.046 --> 09:43.038
Take a walk through them woods
or something like that.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.674
Like that guy
Joyce Kilmer once said.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.446
Joyce? A g UV?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.578
(laughs)

09:50.957 --> 09:54.018
I'm having a moment here, Chach.

09:55.161 --> 09:58.188
Like that guy
Joyce Kilmer once said,

09:58.331 --> 10:00.732
I don't think
I will ever see nothing

10:00.867 --> 10:03.598
quite as beautiful as a tree.

10:03.736 --> 10:07.173
Hi, Fonz, I'm ready.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.399
Well, of course, uh,

10:08.541 --> 10:11.272
Mr. Kilmer never saw
Blossom here, huh?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.844
Hey, Fonz, who you dating?

10:12.979 --> 10:15.004
- An army surplus store?
-(both laugh)

10:15.148 --> 10:17.241
Kidding... kidding, Fonz!
A little backpack humor.

10:17.383 --> 10:20.444
She's beautiful, like a tree,
Fonz, great limbs.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.919
(laughs)

10:23.056 --> 10:24.182
Come on, guys. We're all packed.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.848
- Help with the drums.
- Lori Beth, you're cute.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.926
- Hey, Lori Beth.
- Hi, guys. Seen Richie?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.255
No, but we've got
to get out of here fast.

10:29.395 --> 10:30.419
Al's closing. Right, Al?

10:30.563 --> 10:31.792
Yeah, yeah.
Looking for Richie?

10:31.931 --> 10:33.194
- Yeah.
- He's in the men's room.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.493
Trying not to look pathetic.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.624
I'll get him.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.794
Thanks, Al.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.634
I heard, Al. Thank you.

10:40.773 --> 10:41.638
Where have you been?

10:41.774 --> 10:43.106
I've been waiting for you
for a half an hour.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.369
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- What were you doing?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.843
Helping some Boy Scout cross
the street or something?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.540
No, I had to stay
after my modern dance class.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.446
I was helping Jean Pierre

10:51.584 --> 10:52.551
with his tour jetés.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.051
With his What?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.586
Oh, it's a dance expression.

10:55.722 --> 10:57.986
He was helping me
with my rond de jambes.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.717
My leg exercises.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.793
I can't believe you let
a man named Jean Pierre

11:01.928 --> 11:04.021
touch your leg like that.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.962
Rich, we were just dancing.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.294
Let me tell you something.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.562
After class, leg-touching
does not count as dancing.

11:10.703 --> 11:11.898
Boy, are you something.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.836
Why do you think that just
because I help a guy out,

11:13.973 --> 11:15.873
he has an ulterior motive?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.840
Because I understand guys,
Lori Beth.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.240
I happen to be a guy
and I know that...

11:19.379 --> 11:22.781
I can do my own coat, thank you.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.213
And let me tell you something.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.285
One of these days
you're gonna run into a guy

11:26.419 --> 11:28.046
who thinks your friendliness
is a come-on.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.587
And then,
little girlie, you're gonna

11:29.722 --> 11:31.213
find yourself in hot soup.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.417
Boy, are you strange.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.084
No, not strange. Sick.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.957
You sure are.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.292
No, I'm sick and tired
of you making friends

11:39.432 --> 11:41.093
with every guy
who walks through the door.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.259
- I've just about had it.
- Fine!

11:43.403 --> 11:45.269
Look, if you're going
to hassle me

11:45.405 --> 11:46.929
just because I have
male friends,

11:47.073 --> 11:49.235
then maybe
we shouldn't go out anymore.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.277
All right. All right,
that suits me just fine.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.175
- Then it's over.
- It's over.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.449
What about going up
to the Blue Ox?

11:58.585 --> 12:01.418
Why don't you ask Pierre,
the leg-toucher?

12:02.989 --> 12:06.857
I've already been asked
by Richie, the nitpicker.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.960
Nitpicker?

12:10.096 --> 12:12.292
Come on, Richie.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.298
Let's not argue. It's over.

12:14.434 --> 12:18.097
We've both been looking forward
to this evening for a long time.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.432
All right, all right. Fine.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.768
We'll drive up there together--
no obligations.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.104
We'll have our own good time,

12:24.243 --> 12:26.542
separate, alone.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.046
- That's fine with me.
- Hi. ls everything all right?

12:29.182 --> 12:31.173
- J ust g reat!
- Terrific!

12:33.353 --> 12:36.049
(sighs) Well, I'm gonna take off
for the bus station.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.520
I want to get there early,

12:37.657 --> 12:39.557
because I want
to get a window seat.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.086
Nobody's here.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.397
<i>MAN:
Close but not close enough.</i>

12:55.241 --> 12:57.141
You're buying the drinks.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.378
What a ride!

13:03.516 --> 13:05.644
Well, you should have put
the chains on the back tires,

13:05.785 --> 13:08.049
not the front.

13:08.187 --> 13:12.022
So, on the way home,
we'll drive backwards.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.957
Hey, Malph, get a load of this,
real woodsy.

13:15.094 --> 13:18.030
Yeah, great place
to take a termite to dinner.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.063
(Potsie laughs)

13:19.198 --> 13:22.100
Hey, Chach, Rich and Lori Beth
make up?

13:22.235 --> 13:23.168
Are you kidding?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.600
They were fighting
all the way here.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.934
She'd turn up the heat,
he'd roll down the window.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.735
Up and down, up and down.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.140
My feet were burning
and my teeth were chattering.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.747
- I was hot.
- Well, I was cold.

13:34.881 --> 13:37.714
How could you be cold when the
window was only open an inch?

13:37.850 --> 13:39.648
All right, all right,
don't make a scene here.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.755
I am not making a scene here.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.288
My, isn't this charming?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.055
(mocking):
My, isn't this charming?

13:55.034 --> 13:59.836
Whoa! It's a log cabin,
just like my syrup can.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.476
I can open my own case,
thank you.

14:05.611 --> 14:08.012
Fonzie, aren't you gonna do
anything about those two?

14:08.147 --> 14:10.173
Hey, my beautiful Blossom,

14:10.316 --> 14:13.877
the Fonz does not meddle
in the battle of the sexes, huh?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.785
Come on. Let's go out there and
shake hands with Mother Nature.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.891
How about we take a,
a beautiful long walk

14:19.025 --> 14:20.049
through the woods, huh?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.923
- Just you and me, huh?
-(Blossom clears throat)

14:23.062 --> 14:25.224
Are there any wild animals
out there?

14:25.364 --> 14:27.162
No. Well, just one.

14:27.300 --> 14:31.259
It's wearing
a long, red plaid scarf.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.634
Whoa!

14:34.807 --> 14:36.002
(wind whistling)

14:36.142 --> 14:38.577
Come on, guys, let's get started
setting up, okay?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.042
- All right, yeah, yeah.
- Sure, sure.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.239
- Hey, Leather.
- Hi, Leather. -Hey, Leather.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.146
- Hey, guys.
- Gotcha!

14:45.284 --> 14:46.616
- Hey, you made it.
- Yeah. -Yeah.

14:46.753 --> 14:47.742
Yeah, for a while there,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.184
I thought you got lost
or something.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.222
Well, we would have made it
soonen

14:51.357 --> 14:53.451
-but the huskies couldn't pull
the car. -(all laugh)

14:53.593 --> 14:54.890
Humor for all seasons.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.258
Yeah, I know, I know it's
a little bit out of the way,

14:57.396 --> 14:59.422
but I'm doing it as a favor
for an old friend.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.501
Oh, yeah? Who's your friend,
Smokey the Bear? Another one!

15:02.635 --> 15:03.898
I'm hot tonight.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.163
No, it's Ma Hopkins.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.500
She used to be in reform school
with me, as a cook.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.506
And now she's making
a go of this place.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.734
RALPH:
Oh, yeah?

15:10.877 --> 15:11.969
Hey, where are the Suedes?

15:12.111 --> 15:13.238
- What, Millie and Tillie?
- Yeah.

15:13.379 --> 15:14.744
They're in the kitchen
making chili.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.280
- Beat ya!
- You did, you did.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.610
(triangle rings)

15:17.750 --> 15:19.445
Oh, that's her.
Dinner's ready.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.985
Come on. I'll show you
where to put your things,

15:21.120 --> 15:23.783
and then we can get
a bite to eat.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.322
BOTH:
I'm not hungry.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.948
I am. I love chili.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.083
Hey, Malph, free food.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.931
(grunts)

15:32.064 --> 15:33.396
Are you all right?

15:33.533 --> 15:36.468
Ah, just a splinter,
little lady.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.969
Aw. Here, here, don't do that!

15:39.105 --> 15:42.097
I'll pull it out.
I have long nails.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.676
Wait a minute.
Lori Beth, long nails?

15:44.811 --> 15:46.210
I don't think...

15:46.345 --> 15:51.374
Look... do you really have
to do this?

15:51.517 --> 15:52.917
Ah. Thanks. That feels better.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.885
We'll go to the kitchen.
I'll wash it off.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.487
We're going to the kitchen
to wash my hands.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.427
Who do you think you are,
Florence Nightingale?

16:04.564 --> 16:07.795
POTSIE: For a final number,
Leather Tuscadero!

16:09.000 --> 16:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:01.881 --> 18:04.873
-(song ends)
-(whooping, whistling)

18:08.955 --> 18:10.217
Thank you.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.983
Well, that's our last number
for tonight,

18:12.124 --> 18:15.094
and as you can see, it's, uh,
snowing pretty hard out there.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.786
(chuckling):
Snowing.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.989
LEATHER (laughing):
So be...

18:19.131 --> 18:20.827
so be careful on your way home.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.628
But before you go,
how about a big hand

18:22.768 --> 18:24.634
for Millie and Tillie,
the Suedes.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.434
(cheering, whooping)

18:30.209 --> 18:32.769
And... the band.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.278
(light clapping)

18:35.414 --> 18:37.383
(quietly):
Listen, you guys, you really...

18:37.516 --> 18:39.951
ALL:
Got to get a name.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.414
Okay, so you'll be able
to get the tow truck here

18:43.556 --> 18:44.785
just as soon as you can?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.517
-(wind howling)
- Oh, great.

18:46.659 --> 18:47.626
Uh-huh.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.956
- Oh, yeah, great.
- Where is everybody?

18:50.096 --> 18:52.587
Uh, excuse me. Well, uh,
they went back in Ralph's car.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.131
Mine broke down.

18:54.266 --> 18:57.259
-(wind howling) -Yeah, right,
I'm at the Blue Ox Inn, and...

18:57.403 --> 18:59.633
- Pretend we're together.
- Lori Beth, what is

18:59.772 --> 19:01.501
your problem?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.700
- That's the problem.
- Huh? Well, e-excuse me.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.936
Yeah. Right.
Yeah, yeah, I got to go.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.739
Thanks a lot. Bye.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.609
Ah. Hey, you country guys
are real nice.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.979
Yeah, I just talked to a guy,
Jed, do you know him?

19:12.118 --> 19:13.517
- He's a wonderful guy.
- Richie... (chuckles)

19:13.652 --> 19:17.214
he wants to pull me
through the snow by my hair.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.585
Come on outside, little lady.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.818
-(gasps) -You and me
got some funning to do.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.120
Hey, wait a minute!

19:22.261 --> 19:24.389
You can't just carry off
my girl like that.

19:24.530 --> 19:27.056
Are you with this
skinny little guy?

19:27.199 --> 19:28.861
Yeah, she's with
this skinny little guy!

19:29.001 --> 19:31.868
And you better put her down
right now or else, bucko!

19:32.004 --> 19:34.940
Oh, boy, a fight.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.566
I thought I was
gonna have to go all night

19:37.710 --> 19:39.906
without getting
to punch some heads in.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.747
-(wind howling) -FONZIE:
Whoa, let me tell you something,

19:43.883 --> 19:46.875
Ralph's car is broken down,
you know? Uh...

19:47.019 --> 19:48.885
What are you doing, Red?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.580
He's shaking me, Fonz.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.747
Wait, wait! Whoa!

19:51.891 --> 19:53.051
I'm glad you're here.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.184
You picked a fight
with a red and black tree?

19:59.098 --> 20:01.032
Here, this'll help even it up.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.192
Wait a minute,
I don't want to play with this.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.327
This is dangerous here.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.274
RICHIE:
Oh.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.173
Oh, Fonz, that was good,
that was good.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.642
Good? The man is a mountain.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.213
What are you talking, good?

20:15.347 --> 20:17.942
All right, hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it, hold it.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.211
You know what's wrong here?
I'll tell you what's wrong.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.287
I see it now.
You're too tense.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.357
Yeah. Loosen up.
Open those fingers up.

20:25.491 --> 20:26.515
Yeah, shake 'em out.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.183
Don't that feel good! Whoo!

20:28.327 --> 20:31.024
Yeah. Hey, listen, let me ask
you a very important question.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.961
Have you lived here
all your life?

20:33.099 --> 20:34.896
Yeah, I guess.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.161
Have you ever seen
a blue jay in the snow?

20:37.303 --> 20:40.568
I'm talking about a blue jay
with its wings spread out,

20:40.706 --> 20:43.937
nestled... in that
blanket of white, going,

20:44.076 --> 20:47.239
(high-pitched):
"Caw, caw, caw."

20:47.379 --> 20:48.244
Caw?

20:48.380 --> 20:49.780
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.077
Here we go.
I'll show it to you right now.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.207
There we go.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.514
- Hello.
- Are you sure?

20:55.654 --> 21:00.092
Am I sure? Would ljosh
a very sensitive man like you?

21:00.226 --> 21:02.217
Hey, come on.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.853
Are you nuts?!

21:11.036 --> 21:13.130
Richie, what is going on?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.398
That is great strategy.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.872
See, Fonz is gonna lure
that guy out into the snow.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.738
He's gonna say,
"Here, look at the blue jay."

21:18.878 --> 21:21.278
The guy's gonna look up,
and then whap, hoo, faw!

21:21.413 --> 21:22.904
We're gonna nail that guy.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.311
Richie, he's so big!

21:24.450 --> 21:26.316
Yeah. But not for the two of us.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.510
I think.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.087
(Richie yells)

21:29.221 --> 21:31.053
Richie!

21:38.864 --> 21:40.764
An icicle.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.766
Boy, look
at this little dickens.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.961
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Oh, yeah.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.436
I'll tell you something,
I'll bet you've looked at those

21:47.573 --> 21:50.372
all your life, but you never
really saw it like this, huh?

21:50.509 --> 21:52.569
I mean, just look
at the colors- the ice blue,

21:52.711 --> 21:54.771
the white and everything.
Why don't you take it

21:54.914 --> 21:57.280
over to the fire there
and watch it melt?

21:57.416 --> 21:59.441
Yeah, then we'll
put it all back together.

21:59.585 --> 22:00.882
Yeah, whatever you say.

22:04.590 --> 22:05.853
Okay.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.517
Why'd you jump on his back?
He's a mountain.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.958
Well, it was just embarrassing.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.859
The man hung me in a tree.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.693
Well, he took you down.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.960
Are you siding with him, Lori
Beth? Are you starting again?

22:16.101 --> 22:18.070
- Are you gonna side with...?
- All right, hold it, hold it,

22:18.204 --> 22:19.193
hold it!

22:19.338 --> 22:22.000
I am tired of listening
to you two bicker.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.665
You know what I mean?
Now, you...

22:23.809 --> 22:25.334
right here, you got to choose

22:25.477 --> 22:27.139
who you're
gonna be friendly with,

22:27.279 --> 22:30.146
'cause not every guy
is a gentleman like me.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.751
And, you, you got
to let her have some friends

22:32.885 --> 22:35.354
of the opposite gender,
you know? That's only polite.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.888
You know what I mean?
All right, now it's settled.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.650
So kiss and make up.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.157
Pucker up.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.233
Now, don't that feel
much better?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.338
We're gonna go over to the,
uh, fire and finish making up.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.371
- Hey, I think that's
a great idea. -Come on.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.498
FONZIE:
All right.

22:59.511 --> 23:00.911
That was beautiful, Fonzie.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.537
It's all gone.
I'm gonna go out

23:02.681 --> 23:04.411
and see if I can find some more.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.279
- I almost forget.
- FONZIE: What'd you forget?

23:06.418 --> 23:08.318
- Your application.
- For what?

23:08.454 --> 23:11.981
It's for our annual
Punch in the Face Festival.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.491
(laughing):
Punch in the Face Festival.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.027
Come early.
You get the best faces that way.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.824
Do you?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.660
Uh, no, I don't think so.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.030
Last year he told me
that his sister won.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.228
Whoa!

23:25.371 --> 23:26.964
Listen, I got to go out there

23:27.106 --> 23:30.166
'cause I got to dig Malph's car
out of the snow, all right?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.372
Blue jays, the Fonz is comin'!

23:33.512 --> 23:35.310
(birds chirping)

23:35.447 --> 23:37.575
I love that they love me.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.184
Whoa!

23:42.921 --> 23:44.913
<i>II</i>

23:53.232 --> 23:54.256
Finished the dishes.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.867
I'm going over
to Jenny Piccalds.

23:56.001 --> 23:59.801
Oh, oh, Mom, can, Jenny borrow
your Feminine Mystique book?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.167
- No.
- Certainly, d...

24:01.307 --> 24:03.502
Aw, Dad, don't be such a prude.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.975
She's already read
Forever Amber anyways.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.841
See you, kids.

24:09.915 --> 24:12.851
I wish you never heard
of that silly book, Marion.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.851
It's not a silly book, Howard.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.979
It, it just says
that women have rights.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.683
Well, I took you out to dinner--
what else do you want?

24:21.727 --> 24:24.253
Well...

24:24.396 --> 24:26.558
(whispering inaudibly)

24:28.167 --> 24:32.069
Oh, come on, Marion, we haven't
done that in a long time.

24:33.238 --> 24:36.106
Oh, come on, Howard,
let's live it up.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.732
Well...

24:40.879 --> 24:43.041
You know what, Howard?

24:43.182 --> 24:44.274
What?

24:44.416 --> 24:46.043
I'm gonna have a banana split!

24:46.185 --> 24:47.709
And I'm gonna have tutti-frutti.
