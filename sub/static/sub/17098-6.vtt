It'll give me a chance
to review the policy on...

10:21.583 --> 10:23.041
Termination. (SIGHS)

10:23.416 --> 10:25.375
Between you and me, I've never
had to fire anyone before.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.625
Well, hopefully,
it won't come to that.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.833
Okay, but I have
a very bad feeling
it will come to that.

10:31.833 --> 10:33.333
Okay, well, just wait.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.333
Oh, I'll wait...

10:36.000 --> 10:37.666
...for the axe to fall.

10:45.375 --> 10:48.916
And the crane...
Ah! Not the crane.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.250
Because I have crane.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.791
-And the man with umbrella.
-How do you have

10:52.791 --> 10:55.041
the crane, the rooster,
the moon and the man
with the umbrella

10:55.041 --> 10:56.166
five times in a row?

10:56.166 --> 10:58.291
Ah, what I can say?
They all love me.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.000
You are cheating somehow.

11:00.625 --> 11:01.833
You cheating somehow...

11:02.375 --> 11:04.125
...at losing every time.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.125
What is with the merchandise?

11:06.125 --> 11:09.125
Other day, little kid in
the store causing problem.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.833
-Crushing chip.
-Oh.

11:10.833 --> 11:13.791
At my restaurant,
they come in like it is
their own living room,

11:13.791 --> 11:17.416
wearing capes,
Spiderman pyjamas,

11:17.416 --> 11:21.416
tripping waiters,
throwing chapatis like
they're frisbees.

11:21.416 --> 11:23.291
And the parents do nothing.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.583
When I was a child,
I could not even
speak in public.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.916
Yeah.
If I even look at my father...

11:29.916 --> 11:31.125
Tack!

11:31.125 --> 11:33.291
If I forgot to touch
my grandmother's feet,

11:33.291 --> 11:35.541
swift cricket bat
to the backside.

11:35.791 --> 11:39.375
One time I hold a 20-pound
English-Korean dictionary

11:39.375 --> 11:42.250
over my head outside
in a heat wave.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.000
If I drop just
one centimetre?

11:45.208 --> 11:46.375
Tack!

11:46.375 --> 11:49.000
Nowadays, children
are just tiny maharajas.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Very important.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.666
Is better to raise them
so they not think
they is so smart.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.416
Not so special.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.708
Then they growing up
working hard.

11:58.708 --> 12:01.500
I think we raised our kids
the right way, Mr. Kim.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.375
Yeah, I think so.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.000
So, how you daughter doing?

12:09.833 --> 12:11.041
She is not speaking
to me anymore.

12:13.541 --> 12:15.125
You talk to your son lately?

12:18.500 --> 12:20.208
We can't do this to Terence.

12:20.208 --> 12:23.208
One hundred percent agree.
Or can we?

12:25.083 --> 12:26.333
Look,

12:27.125 --> 12:29.125
I did what you said
and destroyed the paperwork.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.666
-I never told you to do that.
-Well, I'm glad one of us
was thinking.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.166
We're in the clear now.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.416
So you're suggesting a guy
we both like,

12:38.416 --> 12:40.250
me, should get fired?

12:40.250 --> 12:43.791
And the guy we hate,
Terence, gets a free pass?

12:43.791 --> 12:45.000
I don't hate Terence.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.333
So, you gonna rat out
the guy that got you this job?

12:50.291 --> 12:51.958
No, you're going to.

12:52.208 --> 12:55.333
I'm not jumping on
a grenade that's already
in Terence's pants.

12:57.666 --> 13:00.041
-Where you going?
-I'm gonna tell her I did it.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.041
You're bluffing.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.833
-It's Terence, man! Terence!
-What?

13:06.500 --> 13:07.708
What?

13:07.708 --> 13:09.833
-You yelled my name.
-I yell a lot of things.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.833
Okay, see you.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.041
Can I help you find anything?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
New chamomile ice tea?
Very calming.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.166
I'd like you
to apologize to Oliver.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.166
I don't think so.

13:35.375 --> 13:38.333
It's a very important moment
for my son to see that adults
can admit to their mistakes.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.875
Then you say sorry.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.625
-Hey, can I just grab this?
-Yeah, just one second.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.666
-You gonna stop him?
-Are you gonna apologize?

13:54.125 --> 13:56.000
I'm just gonna leave
my money over here.

13:56.375 --> 13:57.500
Okay, see you.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.791
I'm sorry, Oliver,

14:00.791 --> 14:02.125
for invading
your personal space.

14:03.791 --> 14:05.916
I'm sorry, Oliver,
that you having mommy
who is spoiling you!

14:06.375 --> 14:07.916
What is that supposed to mean?

14:08.375 --> 14:10.041
-Ms. Murray...
-Janet.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.500
Your father was just
giving me parenting advice.

14:12.791 --> 14:16.333
This coming from a man
who thinks that corporal
punishment is <i> de rigueur.</i>

14:16.791 --> 14:18.875
What is doo-ree-ger?
What she talking?

14:18.875 --> 14:21.375
Do not yell at her.
This ends now.

14:21.958 --> 14:23.583
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.833
Janet's confided in me

14:25.833 --> 14:28.875
how she's been the victim
of physical and
psychological abuse.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.041
-Abuse?
-What? Janet?

14:31.041 --> 14:32.125
UMMA: Who's doing that?

14:32.125 --> 14:33.875
I didn't say anything
about abuse.

14:33.875 --> 14:36.416
I don't think anybody
said anything about abuse.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.916
You told me how your suffering
has informed your work.

14:38.916 --> 14:41.333
No, you told me that.
I just didn't...

14:41.916 --> 14:43.000
...disagree.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You suffer because of Appa?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.916
Janet, I make you suffer?

14:47.916 --> 14:49.500
I never said suffer.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.208
I just said you are
who you are.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.833
You know how you can be.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.875
How he can be?

15:01.083 --> 15:04.875
I make mistake.
Your kid is not
worst behaved here.

15:11.791 --> 15:14.166
My dad didn't abuse me, okay!

15:14.166 --> 15:15.916
-(SHUSHING)
-It was just a flick! A flick.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.916
You better go.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.625
And take monster with you.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.500
-I had no idea how bad
things were.
-Go! Please.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.666
Okay, Oliver.
Yes, put down the crackers.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.625
Because, yes,
we're leaving now.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.166
(OLIVER SCREAMING)

15:31.166 --> 15:33.916
I'll give you some iPad time
if you leave with Mummy now!

15:44.166 --> 15:46.375
Umma, you know I don't think
that about Appa, right?

15:46.875 --> 15:48.916
Every day, Appa is looking
out the window.

15:48.916 --> 15:49.916
You know what he looking for?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.041
Illegally parked
Japanese cars?

15:53.083 --> 15:54.250
He is looking for Jung.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.333
Hoping...

15:57.916 --> 16:00.750
And for school grade,
you throw his mistake
in his face?

16:02.958 --> 16:04.125
How you can do that?

16:13.375 --> 16:15.125
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.750
-We need to talk.
-Okay, super-serious.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.083
-You found out something,
didn't you?
-You can't fire Terence.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.083
-It'd be a big mistake.
-I get it.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.375
You want to do it for me
in a misguided

16:27.375 --> 16:30.083
but pretty amazing attempt
to keep my hands clean.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.333
-I don't think that...
-(SHUSHING)

16:31.333 --> 16:33.750
You,
Mr. Knight-in-Shining-Armour.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.166
The least we can do is deal
with this together.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.791
I'm the one that
should be fired.

16:37.791 --> 16:38.750
Oh, good. Role play.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.416
Ah, you be the firee.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.666
I'll be the firer.

16:41.666 --> 16:43.750
They explain everything
in the company policy.

16:44.458 --> 16:46.791
How to fire
a depressed employee,

16:46.791 --> 16:48.416
a pregnant employee,

16:48.416 --> 16:51.416
an employee with whom
you're having
a personal relationship.

16:51.666 --> 16:52.750
Can you imagine?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.000
How would that even work?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.416
I can make this easy for you.

16:55.416 --> 16:56.583
Ah, that's sweet.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.750
But I don't think
it's supposed to be easy.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.916
In fact, this is one
of the hardest things

17:02.916 --> 17:05.875
a manager or assistant manager
has to do.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.750
We're going to have
to sit Terence down...

17:12.000 --> 17:13.875
-Neutral environment...
-I did it.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.625
-Did what?
-I used one of the cars.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.666
-You did the Uber?
-It's not Uber, it's Dash.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.666
Wait, so it wasn't Terence?

17:24.708 --> 17:25.708
I didn't say that.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.625
I just mean it wasn't Jung.

17:29.625 --> 17:33.166
-You said it was you.
-Only because I thought you
were firing Jung.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.875
Okay, I'll clean out my bin.

17:39.708 --> 17:40.708
Wait.

17:42.666 --> 17:45.583
-He's not doing this anymore.
-Only 'cause he got caught.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.791
-Am I right?
-But I knew about this.

17:49.708 --> 17:50.708
And I didn't tell you.

17:52.958 --> 17:54.625
Okay, um...

17:55.625 --> 17:57.125
Well...

17:58.750 --> 18:01.625
Unfortunately, I have
no choice but to...

18:02.958 --> 18:05.750
Okay, I'm not going
to do that, or that.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.791
Going to pretend
I didn't see that.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.541
Oh, okay...

18:10.833 --> 18:13.625
I will officially log
this offence.

18:14.666 --> 18:18.708
Maybe not in my computer,
but a file that will probably
just stay in my office.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.208
Thank you.
It won't happen again.

18:21.708 --> 18:22.708
It better not.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.458
Can I just say one more thing?

18:24.458 --> 18:25.500
Nope, we're done.

18:25.791 --> 18:27.583
Good. Glad we cleared that up.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.041
Appa, you need any help
with those?

18:51.708 --> 18:53.208
I'm glad you got
more of those.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.541
Because we were out of those.
And now we got more.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.625
So that's good.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.500
Appa, I'm sorry.

19:14.375 --> 19:16.541
You think I was a bad Appa
to you growing up?

19:20.250 --> 19:22.041
If you think I was
a bad Appa to you,

19:23.333 --> 19:25.458
go ahead, flick.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.666
I don't think
you were a bad Appa.

19:30.541 --> 19:32.708
I think you were a great Appa.

19:35.541 --> 19:39.208
I love you and I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have let her
say those things.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.208
(GASPS)

19:42.208 --> 19:44.708
If you think I was
a bad daughter...

19:47.208 --> 19:48.666
I wasn't
going to say flick me.

19:48.666 --> 19:50.625
Too late. Too bad, so sad.

19:50.625 --> 19:51.875
(CHUCKLES)

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
You finish.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.083
Six more case
in the van.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.083
(CHUCKLES)

20:18.833 --> 20:19.833
(SIGHS)

20:22.958 --> 20:24.125
You think I'm too angry?

20:25.375 --> 20:26.750
I think you angry enough.

20:27.958 --> 20:29.083
You think you is too angry?

20:30.250 --> 20:31.250
No.

20:31.791 --> 20:33.333
-Then what is problem?
-No problem.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.041
Okay. Good night.

20:36.458 --> 20:37.583
Good night.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.958
Maybe I too strict with Janet.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.333
Not too strict.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.583
Not too, little strict.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.708
Janet is good student,
good girl because
we is good parent.

20:56.666 --> 20:57.875
We is strict enough.

20:58.375 --> 20:59.666
Yeah, I think so too.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.583
Anything else you
want to talk about?

21:04.083 --> 21:06.958
-No.
-Okay, go to sleep.

21:07.208 --> 21:09.583
-Yeah. Good night.
-Good night.

21:11.708 --> 21:12.708

21:16.666 --> 21:18.458
-We eat all of cake?
-(SIGHS)

21:18.458 --> 21:19.875
Ice cream too?

21:20.583 --> 21:21.583
-Whoa!
-What?

21:22.333 --> 21:24.666
-All the talking
make me hungry.
-Ow.
