00:01.400 --> 00:03.630
Would you buy a horse that broke its leg?

00:06.480 --> 00:08.071
You Know, she might win.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.918
Could be easy money.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.790
COMMENTATOR: And away they go.
Away to a beautiful start.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.235
And Super from the extreme outside.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.356
Coming from behind is Sonador.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.032
- Her leg looks pretty good.
- Yeah.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.830
COMMENTATOR: They make their way around
the first turn and head onto the back stretch.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.673
- Come on, Sonador! Come on.
- Can you see her?

00:34.760 --> 00:36.830
COMMENTATOR: Running in fourth is Sonador.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.876
And Sonador's now on the move on the outside.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.155
Then we have back in fifth. All For Nothing.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.912
Come on, baby.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.752
Come on, Mike, change your lead now.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.479
COMMENTATOR:
They make their way around the far turn.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.357
- Go!
- Come on, girl.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.556
On the inside comes Obvious Favourite.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.074
Come on, Sonya, only three furlongs to go now.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.475
She's coming up!

00:56.560 --> 00:58.755
Major Easy and Obvious Favourite...

00:58.840 --> 01:01.752
Show her the stick.... now. Get her out of there.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.873
Come on, girl!

01:10.720 --> 01:12.392

01:15.760 --> 01:16.636
Third!

01:28.280 --> 01:30.669
A minute 1 3 seconds. A little slow.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.352
but it's the beginning.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.672
You Know, if Mike wouldn't have been boxed in,
I think.she would've won, sir.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.108
Third place.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.713
So, what'd she get?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.153
$1,1 00.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.195
Sonador.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.474
- Ben Crane?
- Yeah.

01:44.560 --> 01:45.913
Claim.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.638
What? You got to be kidding me.

01:47.720 --> 01:48.914
Claimed?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.513
Wait a second. Hang on a minute.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.113
You said she wouldn't get claimed.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.918
Cale, listen to me.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.149
What was the tag?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.353
How much did you get for her?

01:58.520 --> 01:59.839
1 5,000.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.833
You just sold Sonador.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.356
I don't believe this.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.118
Cale...

02:37.480 --> 02:39.436
I wasn't trying to sell Sonya.

02:41.920 --> 02:46.311
OOut of 1 00 horses that could have been claimed
tonight, you Know how many got claimed?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.435
Two.

02:49.480 --> 02:53.473
Do you understand that you got to
claim the horse before the race is even run?

02:53.560 --> 02:59.032
I just figured there's no way anybody'd take
a chance on a filly that'd already broken her leg.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.596
I guess there was some chance.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.039
She's gone.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.315
She was a good horse, Cale.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.551
- I'm going to miss her, too.
- Please don't treat me like a little kid.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.995
You were just trying to
get some of your money back.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.799
I get it. It's business.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.113
That's right, it is.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.357
- But I wasn't trying to sell Sonya, OOK?
- You lied to me.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.598
You said I'd always have Sonador.
You stood there and said it.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.671
You raced her and she got claimed.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.275
Well, in horse racing, everything doesn't always
end up how you want it to.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.998
She wasn't for sale.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.629
Every racehorse everywhere in the world,
right now, is for sale.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.711
Get that.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.756
She wasn't just some racehorse.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.755
She was our horse.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.469
I told Pat that I was gonna
work.the dinner shift tonight.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.677
Remember. you said you could
go to Cale's school. for Parents' Night.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.830
- Eight o'clock... I got it.
- All right.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.276
Have a good time.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.310
WOOMAN: "My shirt was wet
and it smelled like French toast.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.552
So even though I threw up,
I was happy my dad took..me to the firehouse.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.596
The end."

04:49.320 --> 04:50.594
Thank..you, Miss Richardson.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.436
Thank you.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.591
- Ben Crane.
- Y es, ma'am.

04:56.680 --> 05:01.276
I'd love you to read Cale's story. It's very
inventive. It's right there in the blue folder.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.796
Come on up.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.393
Er, "OOnce upon a time there was a noble king.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.473
He lived in a beautiful castle
overlooking green fields.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.314
An evil storm cast darKness over his castle.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.235
And before he Knew it, dark.knights had begun
to take away his kingdom one piece at a time.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.079
But our king was a warrior

05:38.160 --> 05:41.357
and he Knew that
if he could find his magic horse,

05:41.440 --> 05:43.670
he could restore the kingdom to greatness.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.399
He was not like most kings.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.118
He was quiet and kind.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.798
Everyone loved the king,
which he may not have Known.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.952
He searched and searched
and finally rescued his horse from a raging river.

05:59.960 --> 06:05.796
But by the time he'd freed his horse,
his kingdom was gone and he had given up.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.876
But the horse knew better than he.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.712
The horse took..him over mountain ranges
and across...raging rivers.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.472
When it finally looked like they would die,
the horse asked him to trust him.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.036
The king didn't Know
if the horse had really spoken to him

06:28.120 --> 06:32.398
or he just hadn't had anything to eat
in a few days.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.708
(.(Audience chuckkles)

06:33.800 --> 06:37.190
Not soon after,
the horse attempted to climb a mountain

06:37.280 --> 06:40.113
so steep
the king was sure it would be their deaths.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.276
But the horse reached the top.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.279
And at the top, they found his kingdom restored.

06:55.440 --> 06:59.228
All those who loved him
greeted the king with pie and coffee.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.156
By Cale Crane."

07:11.400 --> 07:12.628
- Can we keep these?
- Yes.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.756
I read your story tonight in school.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.958
The stupid one about the king?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.916
Yeah, the stupid king.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.076
I made mistakes, Cale.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.472
I'm sorry.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.195
So you like the stupid king?

08:15.880 --> 08:18.110
Yeah, I like the stupid king.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.116
I love the stupid king.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.636
He loves you, too.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.956
Ben, there's some guy here to see you.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.031
- Cale.
- Mm?

08:54.120 --> 08:57.112
I got Pop a new goat.
Want to pull him out of the trailer?

08:57.200 --> 08:58.679
Thanks a lot.

09:10.920 --> 09:11.557
Sonya!

09:12.440 --> 09:13.077
Sonya!

09:14.000 --> 09:15.592
You came home!

09:17.520 --> 09:19.511
I'm so glad you're back.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.113
How'd you get her back?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.668
Well, it wasn't just me. Pops helped out, too.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.588
I did?

09:27.680 --> 09:29.557
We're both out of coffee for a while.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.239
All right. I got all the paperwork..here.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.714
Cale, we put 51 % of Sonador in your name.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.791
So from here on out, you make all the decisions.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.552
Don't worry, I got you in there at 39%.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.393
Balon, you and Manny
can split the other ten, huh?

09:47.480 --> 09:48.674
What are you saying, Ben?

09:48.760 --> 09:56.075
Well, I'm saying as soon as she signs this paper,
the new owner of Sonador is Cale Crane.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.432
Welcome to the race business.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.794
Congratulations.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.154
You work.for her now.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.235
OOoh.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.594
OK, boss...

10:09.680 --> 10:10.556
Me?

10:10.640 --> 10:13.393
- What's it gonna be?
- Let's go, senorita.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.799
Come on.

10:28.680 --> 10:32.593
Want me to warm her up and then push her
a little for three furlongs? OOr maybe four?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.511
You want us to blow her out today, right?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.477
And then we can start to build her up. Huh?

10:37.440 --> 10:40.193
Um...yeah.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.554
Let's just blow her out.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.072
BEN: Appreciate it. Bob.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.754
If anything comes up, let me Know.
All right. Good night.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.078
Hey... You're up kind of late.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.196
I've been reading all of Sonya's records.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.754
She won over ยกรช200,000 in graded company.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.671
OOh, yeah, I Know.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.512
OQualifies her for a lot of stakes races.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.670
I was looking through the conditions book..

11:28.240 --> 11:31.073
Well, I'm sure you'll figure something out.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.474
I want you to help me.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.278
I want you to help me train her.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.756
I see.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.313
Well, you'd be getting a trainer.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.073
What is it I'd be getting?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.878
1 0%.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.359
- 20.
- 1 5.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.158
- Done.
- Sign here.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.588
Straight across. Not too tight.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.636
That's it. There you go.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.631
Come on, girl. Come on.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.234
Get up. Let's go. (.Clickks tongue)

12:15.600 --> 12:16.794
She look... good?

12:16.880 --> 12:19.189
((Hubbub of conversation)

12:19.280 --> 12:21.794
- All right, here we go.
- Hello.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.949
Hello.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.110
I want to thank... everyone for coming.

12:25.200 --> 12:29.557
And I've scouted all of Sonador's possible races
and I've pickked one I Know she can win.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.073
LlL: RReally?

12:31.160 --> 12:34.311
- lsn't that good?
- And when is this race?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.356
Saturday, OOcctober 29th.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.396
Gotten the best jockkey.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.993
His name is Manolin Vallarta.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.153
Wait, I'm Manolin Vallarta.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.275
LlL: Great idea.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.670
You told me you were the greatest jockkey
in the world, and I believe you.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.478
((Laughs)

12:50.560 --> 12:53.677
Thank..you, Cale.
Thank..you, but I can't. I'm not ready.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.829
I'm...

12:54.920 --> 12:57.639
"Fat and I got to slim down." Right, Manny?

12:57.720 --> 13:02.635
The 29th of OOcctober is the same day
as the Breeders' Cup Championship, isn't it?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.438
Biggest day in racing.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.353
The Breeders' Cup is, what,
eight races worth $1 4 million?

13:07.440 --> 13:11.399
I don't think..you want to run in any race
on the same day as the Breeders' Cup.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.950
You're right. We shouldn't run in any race
the same day as the Breeders' Cup.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.393
That's why we're gonna run in...
the Breeders' Cup.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.358
- Whoa-ho!
- ((Lil laughs)

13:23.440 --> 13:25.556
That's ambitious.

13:25.640 --> 13:29.474
You can't just show up with your horse
at the Breeders' Cup, honey, and say,

13:29.560 --> 13:32.154
"l want to run in the Classic."
It doesn't work.that way.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.276
Be nice if it did.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.351
Do you Know what the selecction process is?

13:36.440 --> 13:37.998
Er, 1 4 horses.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.152
First seven are graded stakes wins, points,
I don't Know.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.389
Last seven are...

13:42.480 --> 13:44.391
No. No, I don't, really.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.233
The last seven they base on performance
during the year.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.117
But they can make a judgment call.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.236
I'm going to take a shot.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.869
It's a long shot but... why not Sonador?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.951
Why not us?

13:57.040 --> 13:59.190
MANNY: Why not Sonador? That's right.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.635
BALOON: Well. we're going to the Breeders' Cup.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.238
LlL: Did you really not know
how the last horses were chosen?

14:05.320 --> 14:07.072
No, I didn't. Why would l?

14:07.160 --> 14:08.991
I never been there.

14:09.080 --> 14:13.756
But if Sonya does get in, I can tell you
there's gonna be huge fees for a race like that.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.115
So, you Know, this is a pipe dream.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.516
RRemember dreams, Ben?

14:22.160 --> 14:24.515
Well, this one's Cale's.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.397
- Help her live it.
- I want to. Lil.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.514
I do.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.637
I'm just saying that this isn't gonna happen,
that's all, honey.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.676
So what? So what?

14:34.760 --> 14:36.910
Just let it take her as far as it can.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.434
All right.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.109
Five furlongs in 1 01 and change.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.714
- Well, that's better, but...
- She was breezing. Dad.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.711
Don't worry.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.910
CALE: They're good. They look... good.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.710
- Mmm.
- Hey, guys.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.950
OOh, wow, you guys got my favourite.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.796
Balon, where's mine?

15:21.880 --> 15:22.869
Yummy.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.074
Looking for agua?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.878
- This is an orange?
- Mm-hm.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.520
It looks like a painted golf ball.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.875
Manny, run her a little closer to the rail.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.076
The doughnuts are not that good.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.310
CALE AND BALOON: OOh, no!
- Give me another jelly.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.310

Come on, Sonya.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.398
Cale?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.878
I'm up. I'm up.

16:18.960 --> 16:24.114
But, sir, my horse Rapid Cat is the son of
Storm Cat, the best sire in the world.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.350
He deserves to run in the Breeders' Cup.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.477
Mr Sadir Abal, Rapid Cat is 1 88th on the point list.

16:29.560 --> 16:30.834
We've got 1 4 spots.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.992
There's not much hope for RRapid Cat. Next.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.832
(.Crowd chatters)

16:41.240 --> 16:42.798
Is Mr Cale Crane here?

16:42.880 --> 16:45.348
I'm Cale Crane.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.237
- Why don't you stand up?
- ((Laughter)

16:50.680 --> 16:52.511
Miss Cale Crane.

16:54.480 --> 16:59.429
Well, miss, your horse Sonador has 20 points
and that puts her 1 6th on the list.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.318
Though I see that last year she had 42 points.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.075
Yes, sir. She'd have that many points this year,
except she was injured.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.434
She was injured?

17:07.520 --> 17:09.909
Well, do you have a vet's report
says she's sound?

17:10.839 --> 17:12.239
Right here, sir.

17:13.839 --> 17:14.989
Thank..you.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.513
Now, you Know there are 1 4 horses
that get to run.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.069

17:22.160 --> 17:27.871
But to enter this horse in this race.
there's gonna be a fee of $40. 0000.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.834
Did you bring a cheque?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.034
I mailed it.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.758
((Laughter)

17:37.200 --> 17:38.872
- Today.
- (More laughter)

17:40.400 --> 17:43.949
Let's just say that the panel determines
that Sonador belongs in this race.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.716
Now, there's another $80,000 in fees
that's gonna be due on OOcctober 26th.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.677
You prepared for that?

17:51.400 --> 17:54.073
PALMER:. She'll mail it to you.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.394

18:31.320 --> 18:32.469
See you later.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.516
Is Cale with Pop?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.955
Yeah, they're going over race strategies.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.439
She going to get in?

18:39.520 --> 18:41.750

18:45.040 --> 18:46.871
How did Cale do in front of the committee?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.916
Truth? It was rough.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.275
She got kickked around pretty good.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.397
- Why are you smiling?
- Because she kickked right back.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.596
Yeah, she reminds me of somebody.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.992
You were right, Lil.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.036
It was great just letting her try.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.308
So you're saying that I'm smart?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.550
I'm saying you're smart and beautiful.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.636
You think.she has a chance of getting in.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.278
There's a chance.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.316
And the entry fees are $1 20,000.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.435
OOK?

19:20.680 --> 19:22.511
Did you hear me?

19:24.720 --> 19:28.918
- Why are you smiling?
- I feel like I'm on a date.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.753
Cale?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.436
Time for bed, honey.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.797
Well, that works a little better than a buckket now,
doesn't it?

19:51.120 --> 19:52.758
((Laughs) Yes.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.309
How much will you bet on Sonador
to win the Classic?

20:03.400 --> 20:04.594
Don't you think.she can win?

20:07.080 --> 20:09.514
- Well...
- You gotta think.she can win.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.068
What's the harm in thinking she can win?

20:12.160 --> 20:13.798
Say "l think.she can win."

20:13.880 --> 20:15.108
I think she can win.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.071
Good.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.116
She needs to hear you say that.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.828
I would like to see you run against those boys.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.029

22:15.880 --> 22:17.108
MANNY: You gave it away!

22:17.200 --> 22:18.679
You don't even Know the joke.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.716
I can't believe I just did that.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.836
Well, I had to see it for myself.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.194
It's amazing.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.911

22:41.000 --> 22:43.560
to have this broken filly

22:43.640 --> 22:45.596
finish 1 4th in a field of 1 4.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.514
How much you really want to
embarrass yourselves.

22:49.600 --> 22:54.116
Because we all Know that this horse
has got no business in that race.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.115
Ben, l...

22:58.200 --> 23:00.077
I feel bad about what happened between us.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.196
No, look..., honestly, I do.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.316
And I'd like to make it right.

MANNY: A whOle 1,000 fOr me?

23:19.760 --> 23:23.070

23:23.160 --> 23:25.310
Maybe some wine, maybe some tube sockks.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.789
BALON: $1,000 fOr me, tOO?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.917

23:32.000 --> 23:33.752
Wait, my share's about eight grand.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.308

23:41.960 --> 23:43.757
All right?

23:43.840 --> 23:46.354
I brought my guys and a trailer with me.

23:46.440 --> 23:49.352
So your luck...is changing.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.510
I Know what you paid for that horse.

23:52.720 --> 23:53.948
Are we done here?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.712
Not my horse, Everett.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.236
Hm?

24:01.960 --> 24:03.552
Well, what do you say, honey?

24:10.400 --> 24:11.674
I'm not selling her.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.195
OK, I found my other pockket.
All right? And you listen to me.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.236

24:37.960 --> 24:43.034
And if you take this offer.
I'll give your dad his job back.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.717
I can't believe it.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.678
The Cranes have finally won one.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.828
Dad?

25:18.160 --> 25:20.116
If it was me...

25:21.920 --> 25:26.869
..I'd tell him to take his money and
his empty trailer and get the hell off our farm.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.397
But...

25:31.480 --> 25:33.152
that's just me.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.034
You're running the big colt Goliath's Boy
in the Classic?

25:40.120 --> 25:42.236
That's right. Goliath's Boy is the favourite.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.915
And when he wins the Cup,
it'll be my fifth horse of the year.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.397
Do you think..Goliath's Boy
remembers what Sonya's butt looks like?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.035
Why?

25:53.120 --> 25:56.715
Because it's all he's gonna be seeing of her
on race day.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.028
((Laughs)

25:58.120 --> 26:00.076
MANNY: That's a good one. kid.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.433
PALMER:. Suit yourself.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.512
Dad.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.876
Any luck?

26:41.960 --> 26:44.155
I can't find a sponsor for this race, Pop.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.196
Nobody wants to take a chance on her.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.948
Called everybody I can think... of.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.835
BEN: You ever seen a kid
so happy with a horse?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.836
Y eah. I have.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.308
CALE: Pick it up.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.753
Come on.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.796
Pick it up. Good girl.

27:17.120 --> 27:20.954
There's other races, darling,
that don't cost so much to enter.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.632
Whoo!

27:27.480 --> 27:29.789
I've lost 1 5 pounds in three weeks.

27:31.280 --> 27:33.430
You should stop training.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.919
We don't have the money to run.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.957
Going down to the Breeders' Cup to tell them
we're dropping out of the race.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.712
OOh.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.916
I had a dream last night, Cale.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.990
I was on a...horse.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.433
A fast horse.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.714
That horse and me...

27:54.800 --> 27:56.756
Ooh! We were flying like angels.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.792
How'd it end?

27:59.880 --> 28:01.836
I woke up and mY hunger was gone.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.318
It was God telling me to race again.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.828
Thank you. Cale.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.672
May God bless you.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.835
Nobody ever thought we'd get in.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.876
No, they didn't. But you did it.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.110
Cale. Pop. Come on.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.758
Get in the truck.....

28:24.840 --> 28:25.989
Come on, Iet's go.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.788
Great idea, Dad.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.552
Whoa, whoa, he said he'd talk to us.

28:50.640 --> 28:54.599
- What are you going to say?
- I'm not. You are.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.793
I'm here to see Prince Sadir.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.508
Prince Tariq is sure he's going to win.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.556
Goliath's Boy is a big, big horse.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.839
BEN: Goliath's Boy is a bully.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.718
He's a bluffer and her horse knows it.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.150
Cale, you look..me in the eye

29:51.240 --> 29:55.313
and you tell me you think..your horse
has a chance of beating my brother's horse.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.195
My horse will beat every horse that shows up.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.355
ALL THREE: Yeah, we're in!

30:23.440 --> 30:26.352
We are in the Breeders' Cup!
I can't believe it! Whoo!

30:30.440 --> 30:32.396
CALE: "You are a great champion.

30:32.480 --> 30:37.349
When you ran. the ground shook.
the sky opened and mere mortals parted.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.953
Parted the way to victory.

30:39.040 --> 30:43.556
where you'll meet me in the winner's circle
and I'll put a blanket of flowers on your back. "

30:45.760 --> 30:47.716
Run hard tomorrow.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.556
Run hard for my dad.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.636
He deserves a good run.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.556
(Knock.. at door)

31:01.520 --> 31:02.748
Pop?

31:02.840 --> 31:04.796
POP: Just a minute.

31:11.480 --> 31:12.515
What?

31:12.600 --> 31:17.549
In 21 Breeders' Cup Classiccs,
you Know how many fillies have ever won it?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.278
None.
