WEBVTT

00:37.371 --> 00:39.273
One day, I decided
to stop practicing gymnastics

00:39.339 --> 00:40.874
and started with parkour.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.145
I got where I am today
because I always did

00:45.212 --> 00:47.080
what my heart told me to do.

00:49.816 --> 00:52.252
<i>When I saw the Beast, I knew</i>

00:52.319 --> 00:55.822
that my parkour skills
would come in handy.

01:01.828 --> 01:04.598
<i>My name is Zigzag,</i>
<i>and I am the Ultimate Beastmaster.</i>

04:48.989 --> 04:50.891
I work at BOPE.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.161
The elite squad of the Military Police
of Rio de Janeiro State.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.962
<i>It's very dangerous.</i>

04:56.029 --> 04:59.633
<i>We are trained</i>
<i>to face the scum of mankind:</i>

04:59.700 --> 05:01.702
<i>the drug traffickers of Rio de Janeiro.</i>

05:01.768 --> 05:03.770
<i>When the police have no other resources,</i>

05:03.837 --> 05:05.272
we are called.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.978
So, Guilherme, how did it go?

05:45.045 --> 05:47.181
It wasn't my day.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.499
Well, I put down real beasts.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.903
<i>I put down men of flesh and blood.</i>

06:09.970 --> 06:13.440
So let's see what happens with this Beast.
It's apparently super huge.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.743
But I think
Brazilian jujitsu will win this time.

06:35.161 --> 06:39.466
Well, I'm an oenologist
at my family's vineyard. I make wine.

06:39.532 --> 06:43.103
<i>This beautiful challenge</i>
<i>brought us together:</i>

06:43.169 --> 06:44.604
<i>my parents, my brother, and me.</i>

06:44.671 --> 06:47.708
<i>It's all about us,</i>
<i>and that vineyard represents</i>

06:47.774 --> 06:51.278
the effort, the discipline, and values
we have as a family.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.488
Come on, please, Santiago! Let's go!

07:09.963 --> 07:12.466
Santiago's gone!

07:12.533 --> 07:16.270
Why, Santiago? This night's hope,

07:16.336 --> 07:17.804
Mexico's hope!

07:26.179 --> 07:29.215
I'm obsessed with perfection.

07:29.282 --> 07:33.687
So I want to be good at what I do
and be in good shape.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.527
Go get 'em, Tiger!

08:19.099 --> 08:20.767
I will now gut the Beast

08:20.834 --> 08:22.902
and turn it inside out.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.948
I was a gymnast.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.250
<i>After that, I went to the circus.</i>

08:37.317 --> 08:41.522
<i>My training is diverse:</i>
<i>acrobatics, posture, movement line...</i>

08:41.588 --> 08:42.990
I do CrossFit.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.958
<i>And this makes me a very powerful athlete.</i>

08:45.025 --> 08:48.762
<i>I'm prepared to use my strength,</i>
<i>run, hang,</i>

08:48.828 --> 08:49.963
whatever it takes.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.238
-Go, Brazil!
-Go, Brazil!

09:03.410 --> 09:06.513
Good job, Brazil!

09:16.390 --> 09:17.991
I don't want to see.

09:24.198 --> 09:27.201
-He did it!
-He did it!

09:47.187 --> 09:48.322
Oy, Phelipe!

09:48.388 --> 09:50.390
Oh, my God. For God's sake.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.859
By participating in this contest,

10:59.926 --> 11:03.530
I'd like to show off my skills.

11:03.597 --> 11:06.500
To show I'm a man.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.502
This is for you.

11:55.515 --> 11:59.686
A key point to win

11:59.753 --> 12:04.224
in this contest
is to beat back your fear.

12:22.276 --> 12:25.012
His feet caught it! Come on!

12:48.702 --> 12:50.304
He fell!

12:51.237 --> 12:56.276
I knew if I fell in there,
I'd be dead in the water. So I kept at it.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.219
Go!

13:36.750 --> 13:38.051
Like a pro!

13:48.028 --> 13:49.296
So close!

14:25.098 --> 14:27.568
Concentrate. Take your time.

14:42.015 --> 14:46.486
If he has a bad performance,
we will go to the Germans' booth.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.690
-If so, we'll make fun of the Germans.
-Yes, we will.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.366
-Yes!
-He got the rope!

15:26.193 --> 15:29.196
-Hold on tight!
-Pull yourself up!

15:29.262 --> 15:32.532
-Well done!
-I almost had a heart attack there, Hans.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.330
We passed them.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.799
Our Brazilian colleagues.

16:38.866 --> 16:40.067
-Brazil is winning.
-No.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.605
-No.
-Yes, absolutely!

16:46.940 --> 16:49.176
Marco Cerullo, Germany, is number one.

16:49.343 --> 16:52.112
Marco Cerullo, Germany, is number one.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.114
-The Brazilians made a little mistake.
-One second!

16:58.819 --> 17:01.588
They know how to dance
and shake their ass...

17:01.654 --> 17:04.857
-We lost the game to those guys!
-...but they are really bad at arithmetic.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.981
She has the nickname Zigzag.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.817
-Zigzag.
-That means she goes like a train.

17:40.159 --> 17:44.497
1.52 meters. That's two yogurts
stacked on top of each other.

18:47.160 --> 18:52.266
No!

18:53.300 --> 18:55.302
But she was really fast.

19:50.591 --> 19:53.794
I acted like a fool
making fun of the Germans.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.562
-I laughed at the Germans.
-That's nothing new for you.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.298
And we lost to Germany... again!

19:59.366 --> 20:01.268
<i>I cannot stand losing to Germany.</i>

20:01.335 --> 20:04.238
It's not possible. It's getting boring.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.324
-Finally!
-It's him!

20:24.391 --> 20:26.493
-South!
-Korea!

21:00.727 --> 21:03.397
-Go!
-That's right!

21:03.463 --> 21:06.466
Oh! Daesung Korea!

21:06.632 --> 21:09.869
Oh! Daesung Korea!

21:19.980 --> 21:22.716
-He's standing up!
-Lift yourself up!

21:57.718 --> 21:58.719
C'mon, Silke!

21:58.784 --> 22:00.786
-C'mon, Silke!
-Go!

22:19.438 --> 22:21.740
Come on, Silke! Come on!

22:30.450 --> 22:32.286
Silke! Germany!

23:23.136 --> 23:24.805
Silke Sollfrank!

23:53.333 --> 23:56.970
My shoe! I had a lot of fun.

24:01.074 --> 24:03.076
We're all part of Silke's run.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.122
I'm proud to be 100% Mexican.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.826
I started gymnastics when I was three.
It defined me as a person.

24:20.894 --> 24:24.932
<i>I was the first Mexican to win</i>
<i>a medal in a World Cup.</i>

24:25.966 --> 24:28.001
I feel gymnastics has given me

24:28.067 --> 24:29.969
the tools I need to face the Beast.

24:55.629 --> 24:58.198
His Olympic dreams vanished,

24:58.265 --> 25:01.768
-but he'll be the Ultimate Beastmaster!
-There he goes!

25:01.834 --> 25:04.203
-Santiago's doing great.
-Great timing, too.

25:12.613 --> 25:14.915
Look at him go. He's doing great!

25:26.894 --> 25:30.597
-Yeah!
-Well done!

25:56.388 --> 26:00.592
It was enough. As I said at the beginning,
I'll get to Level 3.

26:01.762 --> 26:03.931
I'm not competing against them,
just myself.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.666
I wanted to finish it.

26:07.534 --> 26:09.636
Go, Mexico! Let's win this thing!

26:18.178 --> 26:20.814
<i>By becoming the Ultimate Beastmaster,</i>

26:20.881 --> 26:24.585
<i>I'd like to tell the world</i>
<i>that the most important thing</i>

26:24.650 --> 26:27.319
<i>is to constantly continue</i>
<i>challenging yourself.</i>

26:27.753 --> 26:30.689
I will become the Ultimate Beastmaster!
I'll give it my all!

26:49.543 --> 26:52.446
-He stopped!
-Come on, Shimofuji!

27:02.256 --> 27:03.257
He fell!

27:03.322 --> 27:06.225
Here, it seems he threw in the towel.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.433
I'm a CrossFit coach.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.536
<i>Well, I was on the national team.</i>

28:24.605 --> 28:28.876
<i>I was a weightlifter for Korea</i>
<i>and had that training</i>

28:28.941 --> 28:32.811
for the Olympics and Asian Games.

29:18.058 --> 29:20.627
That's it!

29:20.694 --> 29:22.796
-Hyunho Kim.
-Very good!

29:42.749 --> 29:45.085
All that weightlifting now pays off!

29:59.900 --> 30:01.802
-That's it, that's it.
-Yes!

30:14.982 --> 30:17.518
Wow, Level 2 is way harder.

30:17.584 --> 30:21.021
Much, much, much harder.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.702
I was raised by my mother and my aunt.

30:35.769 --> 30:37.471
<i>My mother always wanted me</i>

30:37.536 --> 30:39.571
<i>to follow the path of sports.</i>

30:39.638 --> 30:42.607
If I win, and I will win,

30:42.674 --> 30:45.010
that $10,000 will not be for me.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.179
It will be for my mother and my aunt.

31:33.293 --> 31:36.096
I'm so nervous right now. Oh my.

31:53.180 --> 31:55.482
It's the real-life video game.

31:55.549 --> 31:57.885
Take it easy. Please.

31:57.951 --> 32:00.254
Hold on. Don't fall.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.824
One of our favorites. We lost, but...

32:05.893 --> 32:09.563
We made fun of the Americans
saying that he was better and...

32:54.706 --> 32:59.478
Rafinha and I are hoping
he will get through this first phase.

32:59.544 --> 33:03.315
This way he will eliminate the American,
and we can make fun of Terry Crews.

33:09.823 --> 33:10.891
Let's go, Marco!

33:54.933 --> 33:57.102
Marco, c'mon! Marco!

34:11.051 --> 34:12.352
Come on, Marco!

34:19.457 --> 34:21.326
He is exhausted.

34:55.462 --> 34:57.431
I'm way out of my comfort zone.

34:57.495 --> 34:59.197
I've never done these obstacles before.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.934
This is the time to let my abilities act.

35:48.079 --> 35:50.915
-Swing it!
-You mentioned gymnastics?

35:50.982 --> 35:53.218
Of course, the gymnastics on display.

36:15.442 --> 36:17.311
Santi, my man!

36:17.377 --> 36:19.213
We got lost in that one

36:19.279 --> 36:20.948
and got scared to death.

37:20.007 --> 37:25.579
-Come on, brother!
-Santiago!

37:29.750 --> 37:31.351
It's not true! It can't be!

37:43.297 --> 37:45.799
That was slippery.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.233
And shaky, which changes everything.

37:48.299 --> 37:51.436
It moves. I couldn't grab it right.

38:02.850 --> 38:05.786
I believe the key to victory here

38:05.853 --> 38:07.554
is measuring your jump well

38:07.619 --> 38:09.854
and following through calmly.

38:17.331 --> 38:21.101
What's the matter, Shimofuji?

38:33.480 --> 38:37.317
The jump didn't quite go
the way I wanted it to.

38:37.384 --> 38:39.520
My footing kind of gave way.

39:58.165 --> 39:59.766
What a pity!

41:03.330 --> 41:05.632
While I was a coach,
the members told me

41:05.699 --> 41:08.202
that there was nothing I couldn't do.

41:08.268 --> 41:10.504
So everything expects me to win.

41:10.571 --> 41:12.072
A lot of pressure.

41:12.139 --> 41:14.274
They all cheer for me.

41:19.580 --> 41:21.815
-He grabbed it!
-Yes!

41:21.882 --> 41:23.884
Past the Ejector!

42:18.672 --> 42:20.107
He was so good.

42:20.174 --> 42:21.441
His arms gave out.

42:21.508 --> 42:23.076
I know.

42:23.944 --> 42:26.513
I was gonna do this.

42:26.580 --> 42:28.549
I'm not doing Taekwondo enough.

42:28.615 --> 42:30.417
I should practice it more often.

42:49.236 --> 42:52.105
Level 3 will be quite challenging,

42:52.172 --> 42:54.908
but I am the only girl to come this far.

42:54.975 --> 42:56.777
I did really well.

42:56.844 --> 42:59.146
I don't have anything to lose.

43:07.554 --> 43:11.692
Mexico!

43:11.758 --> 43:13.727
Germany!

43:13.794 --> 43:16.396
-Silke!
-Yes!

43:33.811 --> 43:37.148
Silke Sollfrank flies through this level.

44:04.011 --> 44:07.581
Look at that! With that cool move,

44:07.648 --> 44:09.750
Silke wins over the heart

44:09.816 --> 44:11.752
of the audience.

44:29.670 --> 44:30.938
Extraction is up next.

44:31.004 --> 44:32.206
-That's right up her alley.
-Yes.

44:32.272 --> 44:34.041
Now she moves hand over hand

44:34.107 --> 44:35.943
from one to the other. This only took her

44:36.009 --> 44:38.212
a little more than a minute.
Great performance!

44:54.361 --> 44:57.097
She got the pole!

44:57.164 --> 44:59.833
She has to use that momentum

44:59.900 --> 45:01.268
to reach the other pole.

45:12.446 --> 45:14.882
Hold on!

45:14.948 --> 45:19.152
No!

45:35.669 --> 45:37.070
Are you disappointed?

45:37.137 --> 45:39.506
Not at all.
I think I got very far for a girl.

45:39.573 --> 45:42.276
<i>We all took you into our hearts.</i>

45:42.342 --> 45:45.579
Germany loves you.
A huge applause for Silke Sollfrank!

46:14.474 --> 46:18.445
In physical aspects, I was a weightlifter.

46:18.512 --> 46:22.249
<i>Stamina, strength and power...</i>

46:22.316 --> 46:24.318
I think I'm the best in those.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.651
<i>I feel gymnastics has given me</i>

46:26.720 --> 46:28.989
<i>the tools I need to face the Beast.</i>

46:30.357 --> 46:34.228
<i>To raise Mexico's flag,</i>
<i>to compete in its name...</i>

46:34.294 --> 46:35.929
...fills me with pride and happiness.

46:35.996 --> 46:38.232
Beast, you've met your match.

46:39.333 --> 46:40.634
Ultimate Beastmaster.

46:40.701 --> 46:42.236
Korea, I can do it!

46:49.910 --> 46:53.213
-Hyunho!
-Santiago!

47:20.140 --> 47:21.375
Let's go, Santiago!

47:21.441 --> 47:25.946
Mexico!

47:26.013 --> 47:28.015
Come on, buddy!

48:39.453 --> 48:42.923
-He touched it!
-Hyunho Kim from Korea!

49:27.835 --> 49:29.336
Wow, it's really...

49:29.403 --> 49:31.939
It's amazing.

49:32.005 --> 49:34.808
I never expected it to be
this spectacular.

49:36.176 --> 49:40.280
It was really fun
and I won't forget about this.

49:40.347 --> 49:42.816
I made good friends,

49:42.883 --> 49:45.853
and Santiago was great, too.

49:45.919 --> 49:48.488
I am Beastmaster. Yeah!
