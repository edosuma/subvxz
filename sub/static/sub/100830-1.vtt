[instrumental music]

00:15.391 --> 00:18.350
[indistinct chatter]

00:32.241 --> 00:33.991
You can let me try.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.118
[indistinct chatter]

00:37.788 --> 00:39.329
[elevator bell dings]

00:40.416 --> 00:43.125
Oh, what a great tie, Garrett.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.626
Oh, is that new, Garrett?

00:44.670 --> 00:46.086
Do you mind if I get
the same one, Garrett?

00:46.130 --> 00:47.713
Oh, stop. You're awful.

00:47.757 --> 00:48.714
I think Kyle spends more time in

00:48.758 --> 00:50.340
the boss' office than his own.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.635
Okay, okay. Trivia
at Tuck's Bay tonight, okay?

00:53.679 --> 00:57.014
I hope to see everybody there.
Okay? Everybody.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.600
-First round's on me, baby.
-Okay, top shelf.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.226
What do you say, Russ?
Loosen' up a bit.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.728
[sighs] You're hopeless.

01:02.772 --> 01:04.605
-The human Care Bear.
-Mm.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.441
Russell, you're going, right?

01:07.485 --> 01:08.817
-Oh, yeah. I wouldn't miss it.
-Okay, good.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.235
Uh, Diane,
you wanna carpool with me?

01:10.279 --> 01:12.029
No. I can't. I'm sorry.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.238
-Aw.
-Work.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.207
[knocking on door]

01:23.250 --> 01:25.584
You should go tonight.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.628
-I would if I could, but I--
-No.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.296
Kyle has been in Garrett's ear
at every one

01:29.340 --> 01:30.589
of these after-hours functions,

01:30.633 --> 01:33.675
making his case for partner.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.220
I wanna be named partner
because I deserve it,

01:36.263 --> 01:37.888
not because I'm good
at useless trivia.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.891
Yeah, well, if it came down
to useless trivia,

01:40.935 --> 01:42.101
I'd be CEO by now.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.186
[chuckles] Four wins in a row?

01:44.230 --> 01:47.439
-See, you don't need my help.
-Mm, maybe not.

01:47.483 --> 01:49.817
I wouldn't mind the company.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.153
And Betty steals my pretzels.

01:53.197 --> 01:56.281
[chuckles]
Ah...

01:56.325 --> 01:58.867
That promotion should be yours.
You do deserve it.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.161
Don't let Kyle sweet talk it
out from under you.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.873
Thanks, Russell.
Appreciate that.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.336
And you get a chance to make a
good impression at the retreat.

02:11.674 --> 02:13.048
[sighs]
That...

02:18.722 --> 02:21.223
[birds chirping]

02:23.102 --> 02:24.893
Jake, sweetie?

02:24.937 --> 02:26.145
He's in his room.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.646
Did you get my crab rangoon?

02:27.690 --> 02:30.399
[chuckles] You didn't say
you wanted crab rangoon.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.608
You're my sister,
you're supposed to know

02:31.652 --> 02:33.026
my order by heart.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.447
-Bottom of the bag.
-Bless you.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.158
Hey, go easy on him.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.621
[music playing on earphones]

02:44.665 --> 02:45.789
[knocking on door]

02:45.833 --> 02:47.082
Jake?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.502
Honey, don't you think
that's a little loud?

02:50.546 --> 02:51.628
Hm?

02:52.923 --> 02:55.048
Honey!

02:55.092 --> 02:57.634
-What happened?
-Nothing.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.013
[sighs] Jake, you promised me.
No more fights, remember?

03:01.056 --> 03:02.222
[sighs]

03:06.061 --> 03:07.853
This happen before
or after school?

03:07.897 --> 03:10.272
After.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.566
So I won't be getting a message
from the principal?

03:12.610 --> 03:15.319
No. The message is from coach.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.695
[sighs]

03:20.326 --> 03:22.868
I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to your game today.

03:22.912 --> 03:25.621
It's fine. We lost anyways.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.375
[music playing on earphones]

03:42.973 --> 03:45.098
This is the third fight
this semester.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.059
Is he still seeing
the school counselor?

03:47.102 --> 03:49.853
Yeah. Twice a week.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.480
You know,
I just was on the phone with her

03:51.523 --> 03:53.523
and she was telling me
about all the wonderful progress

03:53.567 --> 03:54.733
he was making.

03:54.777 --> 03:56.151
You think
she was over-selling it?

03:56.195 --> 04:00.155
[sighs]
He's got a black eye, Lori.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.449
He's had a rough road.
It's gonna take some time.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.159
Yeah.

04:04.203 --> 04:07.829
I know.
I just wish I could do more.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.208
What's that?

04:11.252 --> 04:14.461
Oh, it's a invitation.

04:14.505 --> 04:17.339
The firm is hosting
an employee retreat.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.383
A day of wine tasting
at Garrett's house.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.552
-Sounds fun.
-Yeah.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.221
I should really go.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.933
But?

04:27.977 --> 04:29.476
Well, it says

04:29.520 --> 04:31.979
"Spouses and significant others
encouraged."

04:33.732 --> 04:35.190
I'd be the only one there
without a date.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.110
And, you know,
I just really don't wanna deal

04:38.153 --> 04:40.487
with all the sympathetic looks,
you know?

04:42.324 --> 04:44.908
Yeah, sympathy is awful.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.036
You know what I mean.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.163
I mean, I already feel like
people walk on eggshells

04:50.207 --> 04:52.249
whenever they're around me
because of...

04:55.379 --> 04:57.629
You know,
I just would rather not go.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.965
Why don't you ask
that cute coworker of yours out?

05:00.009 --> 05:03.385
-You know, Mr. Trivia.
-Russell?

05:03.429 --> 05:04.594
[laughs]
No.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.555
-[chuckles]
-Why not?

05:06.598 --> 05:09.057
Because he'd get the wrong idea
for one.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.269
Why can't it be the right idea?

05:12.313 --> 05:15.188
Lori, I just, you know,
I just don't feel like dating

05:15.232 --> 05:17.149
right now,
especially someone I work with.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.776
It's just...

05:19.820 --> 05:21.320
Di...

05:23.032 --> 05:24.740
it's been two years.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.994
Yeah, I'm just not ready.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.083
I have an idea.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.468
Now, don't say no right away.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.886
[chuckles]

05:55.397 --> 05:57.898
[instrumental music]

05:59.234 --> 06:00.484
The Companionship Collective?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.986
[chuckles]
It's like a dating service.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.530
And they pair you up
with activity partners.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.032
So you want me to rent a date?

06:07.076 --> 06:09.743
You said yourself you don't want
anything serious.

06:09.787 --> 06:12.871
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

06:12.915 --> 06:14.247
Look, wouldn't I
just be better off

06:14.291 --> 06:15.415
with, like, a dating app
or something?

06:15.459 --> 06:17.209
These are professionals.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.544
They hang on your arm,
they say all the right things

06:19.588 --> 06:21.963
and then you say goodbye.
It's the perfect solution.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.925
You get the benefit of a date
without all the baggage.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.261
[chuckles]

06:28.305 --> 06:30.680
You can't keep avoiding
your coworkers.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.849
They're gonna start
to take it personally.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.147
[crickets chirping]

06:39.191 --> 06:40.565
[sighs]

06:40.609 --> 06:42.776
So you're really gonna go,
right?

06:42.820 --> 06:44.945
I don't know.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.531
You need to stop hiding out
from life.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.949
I'm not hiding.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.660
Are you still taking
those sleeping pills?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.703
[scoffs] No.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.789
I worry about you.

06:55.833 --> 06:59.334
You don't need to worry.
I'm fine. Really.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.048
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.804
Diane?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.222
Oh. Hi.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.726
-If you'll follow me.
-Right. Yes.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.895
-How are you today?
-Very well. How are you?

09:23.939 --> 09:25.939
[consultant] Oh, very good.
Thank you.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.191
-There are a lot of questions.
-Oh, we're very thorough.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.111
Y-you know, I'm just looking
for a plus-one to a work event.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.445
Well, we understand
the pressures

09:32.489 --> 09:33.822
that come along
with social gatherings

09:33.865 --> 09:35.740
and the value
of keeping up appearances.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.119
We strive to provide you with
the best possible experience.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.912
How did you hear
about our services?

09:40.956 --> 09:42.706
-Ah, my sister.
-Oh.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.958
If you wouldn't mind making a
note of that in the bottom box.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.543
-Oh.
-All of this is confidential.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.086
It won't leave my office.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.838
Including my address?

09:49.881 --> 09:52.048
Your companion will meet you
in a public location

09:52.092 --> 09:54.926
and all correspondence
is monitored by our system.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.970
Your safety is our priority.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.476
You'll be taken through
a gallery of our staff.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.103
There will be
a small bio included

10:05.147 --> 10:07.272
that will list likes and skills.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.607
Skills?

10:08.650 --> 10:10.483
For events that require dancing

10:10.527 --> 10:12.861
or horseback riding
or something specific.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.617
So I get to pick my date
out of a catalogue?

10:18.660 --> 10:20.660
Not quite,
you'll rank your choices

10:20.704 --> 10:22.996
and then we'll have to take
a look at the schedule.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.081
Shouldn't take
more than 15 minutes.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.094
[instrumental music]

10:57.324 --> 11:00.367
[music continues]

11:08.126 --> 11:11.753
You are officially booked
for next Saturday at 1 p.m.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.630
But the event's not until 2:00.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.132
Oh, we encourage people to meet
their matches ahead of time

11:16.176 --> 11:18.093
to establish a rapport.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.428
Oh. Okay.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.306
Thank you for choosing
The Companionship Collective.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.516
Thanks.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.981
[gasps] You look pretty
for your date.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.900
It's not a date.

11:33.944 --> 11:38.530
Okay, what do you think?
Pendant or pearls?

11:38.573 --> 11:40.532
Mm, pendant.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.284
Here.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.869
[chuckles]

11:44.913 --> 11:46.705
Can I borrow these sometime?

11:46.748 --> 11:49.791
-Just don't steal 'em.
-I won't.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.168
[sighs] I don't know.
Maybe this is a bad idea.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.129
You always do that.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.840
Doubt your good ideas.
Self-sabotaging behavior.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.134
Please don't attempt
to psychoanalyze me, Lori.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.802
Would you like to join me
on the couch?

12:00.846 --> 12:04.597
-How does that make you feel?
-[cell phone chimes]

12:04.641 --> 12:06.933
Oh, my ride's here. Gotta go.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.561
Text me his picture
when you get there.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.855
-Why?
-For safety purposes.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.566
[scoffs]
Goodbye, Lori.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.152
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.492
[indistinct chatter]

12:27.456 --> 12:28.872
Miles?

12:30.792 --> 12:33.752
-Diane?
-Hi.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.045
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

12:39.676 --> 12:43.136
Uh, I, I don't know
what happens next.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.971
Uh, how about coffee?

12:46.641 --> 12:47.891
Of course.

12:53.857 --> 12:58.485
I'm serious. I'm really excited
about a wine tasting.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.738
My last date
was at a tractor pull,

13:01.782 --> 13:05.658
and let's just say
I wore the wrong shoes.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.040
I'm talking your ear off.
I'm sorry, it's...

13:12.083 --> 13:16.753
Oh, no. I'm sorry. It's not you.
I'm just, uh, a little--

13:16.797 --> 13:18.046
Nervous?

13:19.883 --> 13:22.759
Well, I've never done this
before.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.762
-You know, hire a--
-A companion.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.181
Not that there's anything wrong
with what you do. I...

13:28.225 --> 13:31.309
I know, it's unorthodox.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.312
But I promise you, it's much
more common than you think.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.105
And you're in good company.

13:41.363 --> 13:44.531
So how does this work exactly?

13:44.574 --> 13:46.533
You set the parameters.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.327
And so for the next four hours,
I am whoever you want me to be.

13:49.371 --> 13:52.038
Friend, boyfriend, husband...

13:52.082 --> 13:53.331
Oh. Oh, no. Nothing like that.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.291
Um, no, I just need someone

13:55.335 --> 13:56.960
by my side for the day,

13:57.003 --> 13:59.587
you know,
to take the pressure off.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.632
Well, there are a lot
of expectations put on people.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.802
Sometimes it's easier
to just play the game.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.016
I suppose we should
get our story straight.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.060
-Our story?
-How we met.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.645
First date.
In case anyone asks...

14:15.689 --> 14:18.398
Oh, uh, yes, um...

14:18.441 --> 14:23.194
Let's see,
uh, we met through friends?

14:23.238 --> 14:26.155
-I asked you out.
-They'd never believe that.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.365
Oh. Why not?

14:27.409 --> 14:29.492
That I wouldn't beat you to it.

14:34.291 --> 14:38.918
Thank you. Uh, well,
we should probably get going.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.171
[instrumental music]

14:42.215 --> 14:43.965
[camera clicks]

14:44.009 --> 14:45.592
No photos.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.052
Oh. I'm sorry.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.848
That was
incredibly rude of me...

14:51.892 --> 14:55.351
No. It's-it's fine. It's just my
job, it requires a low profile.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.769
It's really hard
to be a convincing date

14:56.813 --> 14:59.522
if you're all over social media.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.065
Yes. Of course.

15:01.109 --> 15:04.110
[instrumental music]

15:08.992 --> 15:10.617
-You ready?
-I think so.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.493
Don't worry.
No, we're in this together.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.786
Oh, okay.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.873
[Betty] Diane! Diane, hey!

15:16.917 --> 15:20.293
-Hi, Betty.
-I'm so glad you came! Hi.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.463
Hello, I'm Betty.
I work with Diane.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.505
Miles.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.757
Now I see why you've been

15:25.800 --> 15:27.467
holding out on trivia night.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.552
Ah, yes, I have been
a little selfish

15:29.596 --> 15:32.513
when it comes
to Diane's free time.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.932
-Mm.
-Do you need help?

15:33.975 --> 15:35.308
Uh, yes, please.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.101
I need to take those
to the kitchen.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.979
You don't mind if I borrow him
for a second, do you?

15:40.023 --> 15:41.648
-Uh...
-Not at all, please.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.358
Okay. I'll be in the kitchen.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.777
Yes. Okay, thank you.
Right this way.

15:45.820 --> 15:46.819
[laughs]

15:46.863 --> 15:47.904
-Yeah.
-This way?

15:47.948 --> 15:50.323
-Right in here.
-Okay.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.409
I promise, this is my,
one of my last act.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.786
I won't have more than...

15:54.829 --> 15:57.538
[indistinct chatter]

15:57.582 --> 15:59.999
...and he said this is all just
basically old...

16:03.505 --> 16:05.546
[Diane] Russell! Ha-ha.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.340
Hey! You came.

16:07.384 --> 16:10.802
[laughs] Well, someone told me
I should make more of an effort

16:10.845 --> 16:12.345
to network
outside of the office.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.846
-Smart someone.
-Hm.

16:13.890 --> 16:14.931
Someone seems to think so.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.975
[Russell chuckles]

16:17.018 --> 16:18.643
Um, I'm glad you're here though.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.896
I was feeling a little awkward
about flying solo.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.648
-So there's--
-Russell!

16:23.692 --> 16:25.441
Have you met Diane's boyfriend?

16:25.485 --> 16:28.236
-[Miles] Miles.
-Uh...

16:28.279 --> 16:29.737
Russell! Yeah, of course.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.740
I recall Diane
mentioning you once or twice.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.493
Can't say the same.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.786
[Diane chuckles]

16:41.126 --> 16:42.875
Well, we were just about
to go mingle.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.211
It was nice meeting you.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.671
Nice meeting you.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.676
Wow. Go, Diane.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.680
[instrumental music]

16:55.724 --> 16:58.683
[indistinct chatter]

16:58.727 --> 17:01.602
Yeah, the first beauty pageants,
men, they got the tiaras,

17:01.646 --> 17:03.563
women, women got a...

17:03.606 --> 17:05.106
But it was,
it was full of diamonds.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.191
It was,
it was precious gemstones...

17:07.235 --> 17:10.194
[instrumental music]

17:10.238 --> 17:13.239
[indistinct chatter]

17:22.208 --> 17:25.209
[intense music]

17:35.722 --> 17:38.681
[instrumental music]

17:41.144 --> 17:43.978
-Hello.
-Hi.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.354
This is quite the spread
you have here.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.482
Oh, it looks delicious.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.984
And your home is so lovely.
Truly, it's beautiful.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.194
Well, thank you very much.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.488
But all the credit
goes to my wife.

17:56.201 --> 17:59.327
-I'm glad you're here, Diane.
-I wouldn't miss it.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.954
I guess you've heard
that Mark Henderson is retiring

18:01.998 --> 18:03.539
at the end of the year.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.916
We're looking
to promote from within.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.876
Garrett!

18:06.920 --> 18:09.504
Have you tried the Merlot?
It is not to be missed.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.963
Actually, uh, I'm gonna wait

18:11.007 --> 18:13.007
until all the guests arrive
before sampling.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.593
In that case,
I would suggest you hold off.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.095
Why is that?

18:17.138 --> 18:18.262
Well, you wanna start
with something lighter.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.847
Like the Chenin blanc.

18:19.891 --> 18:22.934
The sugars of the Merlot
will linger on your palate.

18:22.977 --> 18:27.230
-Hm. And you are?
-Miles. My date.

18:27.273 --> 18:31.067
Mm. Looks like
Diane brought a ringer.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.236
The man knows his wine.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.029
My grandfather
owned a small vineyard.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.490
-I grew up around it.
-[Garrett] Oh.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.700
Well, in that case,
I'm looking forward

18:39.744 --> 18:41.202
to hearing your take
on our offerings.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.247
-Absolutely. I'd be happy to.
-Garrett Jones.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.165
It's nice to finally put a face
with the name.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.834
Diane speaks very highly of you.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.710
-Oh, she does?
-Oh?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.671
[Garrett] I spotted my wife
in that corner.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.673
Let me introduce you.

18:53.716 --> 18:54.757
[Garrett] Grace.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.135
Hm. Hm.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.220
Spending that time in the temple
made me realize

18:59.264 --> 19:02.140
that money's not the only wealth
in the world.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.809
And that's when I knew I had
to get out of acquisitions.

19:04.853 --> 19:08.020
Huh. Altruistic. Quite a story.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.398
-It's interesting.
-[cell phone chimes]

19:10.441 --> 19:13.359
Uh, sorry, this is, uh,
this is Jake.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.153
-I should probably check in.
-Jake?

19:15.196 --> 19:17.196
Her son.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.740
I'm aware. I was only worried
something was wrong.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.743
No, no, it's nothing like that.
Um, excuse me.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.036
Would you like
another glass of wine?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.621
Uh, yes, please.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.710
Hey, thanks, man.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.587
So how'd you do it, huh?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.799
Defrost the ice queen.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.969
You seem so threatened by her.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.433
She's the one
who needs to be worried.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.437
I don't think
that belongs to you.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.232
Yeah, okay.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.580
You don't think
it's a little bit odd

20:07.624 --> 20:09.957
we hadn't heard a thing
about a boyfriend?

20:10.001 --> 20:12.835
She doesn't have
to tell us everything.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.631
Whoof! But that Miles
is a absolute dream.

20:16.674 --> 20:20.384
[Betty] Whoof.
[Russell] Easy.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.928
You should be happy for her.

20:21.971 --> 20:25.306
After everything
she's gone through...

20:25.350 --> 20:27.767
I can't imagine
losing my husband that young.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.816
You're right.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.611
I know I'm right.
I'm always right.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.030
[Russell laughs]

20:41.074 --> 20:42.865
Right, but you won't let anybody
forget it.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.326
-Right.
-Well, you were amazing.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.788
-My coworkers loved you.
-They were really nice.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.122
I can't believe
you didn't tell me

20:50.166 --> 20:52.375
that your grandfather
owned a vineyard.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.543
He didn't.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.045
Oh.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.506
I was playing the part.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.176
Right. Of course.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.220
[laughing]

21:04.264 --> 21:07.598
Um, well, thank you.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.600
It was honestly my pleasure.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.397
Do I tip you or...

21:14.440 --> 21:15.481
[laughing]

21:15.525 --> 21:16.899
No, no, but the company's

21:16.943 --> 21:19.277
gonna send along a feedback form
in a few days.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.529
Good reviews go a long way
in booking jobs.

21:21.572 --> 21:22.905
Yes. Absolutely.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.908
Um, well,

21:25.952 --> 21:28.035
please consider this
a thank you, then.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.122
Bye, Diane! Bye, Miles!

21:31.165 --> 21:32.957
So nice to meet you.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.750
[chuckles]
You, too, Betty.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.210
-Bye, Betty.
-Bye.

21:36.254 --> 21:39.547
-Get home safe. Okay.
-Oh, I-I will.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.090
Oh, my coworkers
are gonna be so upset

21:41.134 --> 21:43.175
to find out
that we've broken up.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.012
Let 'em down easy.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.346
[Diane chuckles]

21:48.599 --> 21:50.433
Goodnight.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.436
[instrumental music]

22:07.368 --> 22:10.328
[instrumental music]

22:16.377 --> 22:17.960
Hey.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.587
How was it?

22:19.630 --> 22:21.589
Uh, it was good.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.632
Was he nice?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.551
-Very. Yeah.
-Cute?

22:25.595 --> 22:27.762
[chuckles]
Lori.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.348
That's a yes.

22:30.391 --> 22:34.435
-Hate to say I told you so.
-Oh, you love to say that.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.772
Well, seems like
the fake date was a success.

22:39.776 --> 22:40.983
I guess so.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.821
It makes me happy to see you
getting out there, Di.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.992
Wouldn't it be nice to meet
someone you could do

22:50.036 --> 22:51.410
things with,
someone you really care about?

22:51.454 --> 22:53.287
Okay, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.747
It was one date.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.416
Well, you went out,
you had a good time.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.752
The world didn't end.

22:59.796 --> 23:02.505
-You're so right.
-I know. I'm a genius.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.382
[laughing]

23:11.224 --> 23:12.807
So, uh...

23:14.227 --> 23:15.976
how did you two meet?

23:16.687 --> 23:19.563
-Hm?
-Miles.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.857
Um, through my sister.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.070
Been seein' each other long?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.950
Okay, why the sudden interest
in my love life?

23:30.993 --> 23:33.285
Well, I'm just making
polite conversation.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.787
[chuckles]
Okay.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.374
Okay. You know what?

23:38.418 --> 23:41.001
I'm a little surprised
he never came up before.

23:42.463 --> 23:46.048
Well... Oh, hi.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.175
-Hi, you have a minute?
-Yes. Yes, of course.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.803
I'm hosting a small dinner party
at my house tonight.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.763
-Are you free?
-This evening? Yes.

23:52.807 --> 23:55.015
-Absolutely.
-Wonderful.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.476
Oh, and, uh, feel free
to invite Miles.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.145
It's a social gathering.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.980
Um, you know,
I'm actually not sure

24:01.023 --> 24:03.607
if he is available tonight,
but...

24:05.069 --> 24:07.778
Oh. It's a shame.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.241
[elevator bell dings]

24:14.036 --> 24:16.412
Told you he really likes Miles.

24:20.251 --> 24:22.543
[woman on phone] Good morning.
Companionship Collective.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.753
[Diane] Yes, hi,
I was wondering if Miles

24:24.797 --> 24:26.755
has any availability
for this evening.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.341
-Uh, I know it's short notice.
-I believe so.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.927
Great! Uh, wonderful.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.263
[woman on phone] Please hold while I check his availability.

24:34.307 --> 24:35.598
Yes. Yes.

24:35.641 --> 24:36.682
[gasps]

24:40.563 --> 24:44.565
Betty asked me
to give this to you.

24:44.609 --> 24:48.694
Oh. You going
to the partners' dinner tonight?

24:48.738 --> 24:50.029
I am.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.199
Guess I'll see you there.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.286
[woman on phone] Ms. Cooper?

24:57.330 --> 24:59.413
Hello? Yes, I'm here.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.582
I'm sorry. He's booked.

25:01.626 --> 25:02.958
Would you like to schedule
with someone else

25:03.002 --> 25:04.418
for this evening?

25:05.880 --> 25:09.423
No, no. That's okay. Thank you.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.020
[indistinct chatter]

25:31.280 --> 25:32.446
Miles?

25:33.824 --> 25:35.991
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.244
-I thought that was you.
-Small world.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.371
-How are you?
-Good.

25:40.414 --> 25:41.789
Uh, uh, what are you doing here?

25:41.832 --> 25:44.041
Do you have a kid that goes
to this school?

25:44.085 --> 25:46.794
I volunteer for the school's
Big Brother program.

25:46.837 --> 25:49.463
-Oh, really?
-How are you?

25:49.507 --> 25:51.215
Has your boss come to his senses
and promoted you yet?

25:51.259 --> 25:54.134
[chuckles]
Not yet. Um...

25:54.178 --> 25:56.470
No, but he is actually hosting
a dinner tonight

25:56.514 --> 25:59.265
with all of the partners,
and he invited me, so...

25:59.308 --> 26:01.183
Oh, well,
that sounds like a good sign.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.851
[chuckles]
Yeah.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.229
You know,
it's, it's funny I ran into you.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.856
Um, I actually tried calling
the company

26:07.900 --> 26:09.191
to see if you were available
tonight,

26:09.235 --> 26:12.069
but they said
you were booked, so...

26:12.113 --> 26:15.155
Oh, yeah, that fell through.

26:15.199 --> 26:18.075
-Really?
-Yeah. I just got the text.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.828
It happens more often
than you think, honestly.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.414
You know, people get cold feet
or their plans change.

26:23.457 --> 26:26.000
Mm. So you're free?

26:26.043 --> 26:28.419
Seems so.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.045
Would you wanna go with me?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.339
I-I mean, I don't mean
to put you on the spot,

26:32.383 --> 26:34.758
and please don't feel obligated
to, to say yes--

26:34.802 --> 26:37.136
Diane, I'd love to.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.388
You would?

26:39.432 --> 26:41.056
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

26:41.100 --> 26:43.183
Well, great, great, um...

26:43.227 --> 26:45.311
Here, actually,
let me just, uh, call--

26:45.354 --> 26:48.188
Oh, no, no, no. Well,
we, we can do it off the books.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.441
Oh.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.484
Isn't that breaking the rules?

26:52.528 --> 26:54.820
Well, technically.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.366
Oh, I didn't mean to suggest

26:59.410 --> 27:01.035
that you would be doing it
for free, you know?

27:01.078 --> 27:04.663
I'm not, no. I'll be getting
a meal out of it.

27:04.707 --> 27:09.001
[chuckles]
That's very cute.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.003
Okay, looks like
I'll have just enough time

27:11.047 --> 27:12.129
to go home and change.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.714
Yeah, great. Me, too.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.132
If you don't mind,
can I get your number

27:15.176 --> 27:17.843
just in case I'm delayed...

27:17.887 --> 27:19.386
Yeah, of course.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.640
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hi.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.058
-How was practice?
-Good.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.560
-This must be the infamous Jake.
-Yeah.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.479
Hey, I'm Miles,
I'm a friend of your mom's.

27:28.522 --> 27:30.105
Hi.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.025
Okay, well,
we are going to get going.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.068
-I'll see you in a bit.
-Yeah.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.361
-Okay?
-Okay.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.529
-How was practice, sweetie?
-Good.

27:37.573 --> 27:38.781
[Diane] Yeah?
[Jake] Yeah.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.784
[indistinct chatter]

27:45.373 --> 27:48.415
[instrumental music]

27:54.882 --> 27:57.883
[instrumental music]

28:15.903 --> 28:17.444
Second date.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.488
This guy must have
really made an impression.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.448
It's not a date.

28:21.492 --> 28:24.076
Then why are you wearing
your favorite perfume?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.870
Because
it's my favorite perfume.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.081
I thought the whole point
of hiring somebody

28:29.125 --> 28:31.458
was to avoid
romantic entanglements.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.168
It was.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.587
You seem entangled.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.590
Look, all of my coworkers think
that we're already involved.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.759
Plus, my boss has made it clear

28:40.803 --> 28:42.302
that he expects
to see him there tonight.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.431
So I'm just keeping up
appearances.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.850
[Lori] If you say so.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.352
Well, goodnight, Dr. Lori.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.521
Have fun on your not-date.

28:58.446 --> 29:01.405
[instrumental music]

29:03.409 --> 29:05.868
[birds chirping]

29:05.911 --> 29:07.327
[sighs]

29:12.668 --> 29:14.501
[exhales sharply]

29:16.797 --> 29:17.880
[gasps]

29:17.923 --> 29:20.174
Oh. I'm-I'm so sorry.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.009
-Did I, did I scare you?
-No.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.344
Uh... yes.

29:24.388 --> 29:25.888
Sorry. That was my fault.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.724
I wasn't paying attention.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.350
You look beautiful.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.187
Thank you.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.814
You ready? We can take
a minute if you like.

29:35.858 --> 29:37.399
No. No, no, no. I'm fine.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.322
-Okay, we'll, uh...
-Oh.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.115
We need to look convincing,
right?

29:45.159 --> 29:46.742
Right.

29:46.786 --> 29:49.870
-That's a lovely bracelet.
-Oh, thank you.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.330
It was a gift.

30:10.810 --> 30:14.853
And he told me something
that will forever stay with me.

30:14.897 --> 30:17.940
[speaking in foreign language]

30:20.402 --> 30:22.027
To know others is wisdom.

30:22.071 --> 30:24.613
To know oneself
is enlightenment.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.952
I think we're gonna
go to the bar.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.453
It was nice meeting you.

30:34.041 --> 30:37.084
-How do you do it?
-Do what?

30:37.127 --> 30:39.044
Keep track of all the lies.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.838
I prefer to think of them
as characters.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.673
Oh.

30:42.716 --> 30:45.092
Do women ask you to be
a lot of different things?

30:45.135 --> 30:47.302
Usually doctors, lawyers.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.347
And if they wanna tick off
mom and dad at Thanksgiving,

30:50.391 --> 30:51.765
I'm in a band.

30:55.688 --> 30:59.273
Do you ever lose yourself
in all of this?

30:59.316 --> 31:01.441
Sometimes.

31:01.485 --> 31:04.236
But not with you.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.280
With you
I feel like I can be myself.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.909
I'm glad.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.997
[Garrett] Excuse me, everyone.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.834
If you'll join me at the table,
dinner is served.

31:18.878 --> 31:22.170
But right now I need you
to be someone else again.

31:24.675 --> 31:26.758
Okay, so I admit,

31:26.802 --> 31:29.887
I spent most of the game
in the sand trap.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.930
Sir, that course is notorious.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.016
Have you ever played
Claremont Greens, hm?

31:34.059 --> 31:36.226
Them greens is smooth
as pool tables.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.270
Ooh. I have not.

31:38.314 --> 31:40.731
I'll set up a tee time. Yeah?

31:40.774 --> 31:43.734
-How about this weekend?
-That's a wonderful idea.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.861
Diane, do you play?

31:45.905 --> 31:50.574
Um, no. But, well,
I take my son to mini golf.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.284
Oh.

31:52.328 --> 31:55.162
Diane has a mean short game.

31:55.205 --> 31:57.456
Well, what about you, Miles?
Do you play?

31:57.499 --> 31:59.875
Uh, do I play? Uh...
Yeah, a little.

31:59.919 --> 32:03.754
Hm. What's your handicap?

32:03.797 --> 32:05.172
Ten.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.341
"A little," the man says.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.425
[chuckling]

32:08.469 --> 32:10.594
Looks like I found my partner.

32:10.638 --> 32:11.762
[chuckling]

32:20.356 --> 32:22.814
I feel like we've met before.

32:25.152 --> 32:28.528
We have. The wine tasting.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.030
Before.

32:30.074 --> 32:32.324
I don't think so.

32:32.368 --> 32:35.869
Huh. You're sure?

32:35.913 --> 32:37.913
I just have one of those faces.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.583
Yeah.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.335
Yeah. That must be it.

32:56.266 --> 32:59.267
[intense music]

33:02.856 --> 33:05.107
Do you need a ride home?

33:05.150 --> 33:07.734
Oh. No. No.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.945
Honestly, you've done
so much for me already.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.863
It's my pleasure, really.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.908
Lovely party. Lovely.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.284
[Kyle] Goodnight.

33:17.663 --> 33:21.164
On second thought,
that'd be great.

33:21.208 --> 33:25.252
-Thank you.
-Well, I'm right over here.

33:25.295 --> 33:28.171
Listen, if you're up for it,
I'd love to show you something.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.965
It's one of my favorite places
in the city.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.968
[instrumental music]

33:44.273 --> 33:47.107
Thanks again for jumping in
on such short notice.

33:47.151 --> 33:50.235
-You really helped me out.
-It was my pleasure.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.320
I like spending time with you.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.451
Can I ask you something?

33:58.871 --> 34:00.620
Why do you do this?

34:00.664 --> 34:03.165
I mean, work for
The Companionship Collective.

34:09.548 --> 34:13.675
You know what, I'm sorry,
it's none of my business.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.052
No, it's alright.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.473
I lost my wife.

34:25.147 --> 34:28.982
And I never got to say goodbye.

34:29.026 --> 34:31.860
Truth is, I, I don't know
that I'll ever got over it.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.945
But doing this
just helps me realize

34:33.989 --> 34:36.073
why I should put myself
out there.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.078
You know, I understand.

34:43.957 --> 34:46.792
My husband, Robert,

34:46.835 --> 34:49.336
he, he died...

34:50.380 --> 34:53.298
a little over two years ago.

34:53.342 --> 34:56.760
It was all
so very unexpected and...

35:02.893 --> 35:05.310
-I'm sorry.
-No. It's just...

35:05.354 --> 35:07.104
It's my bracelet,

35:07.147 --> 35:10.107
it's pinched me.

35:19.701 --> 35:22.327
I feel like we're the same
in certain ways.

35:24.373 --> 35:28.500
I know what it's like to have an
idea of what your life will be,

35:28.544 --> 35:30.627
only to have it disappear.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.380
I keep trying to move on.

35:33.423 --> 35:36.675
I keep trying
to put myself out there,

35:36.718 --> 35:37.968
but...

35:39.638 --> 35:43.014
I don't know,
just doesn't seem right.

35:49.231 --> 35:52.357
I know Jennifer would want me
to be happy.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.736
So I try to start there.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.787
I should probably get you home.

36:07.082 --> 36:10.125
Yeah. You know what,
it's late. I...

36:12.629 --> 36:15.630
[dramatic music]

36:36.695 --> 36:39.112
[Diane chuckles]

36:39.156 --> 36:41.198
I always walk a date
to the door.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.700
But this is a fake date,
remember?

36:43.744 --> 36:46.161
Well, fake or not, my mother
raised me to be a gentleman.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.914
[chuckles]
You know, for the record,

36:48.957 --> 36:51.708
you don't really have to go
to the golf course this weekend.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.252
Is your handicap really a ten?

36:54.296 --> 36:56.463
No, no. It's an eight.

36:56.506 --> 36:59.507
But I just didn't wanna
show anyone up.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.511
Well...

37:03.555 --> 37:06.514
[instrumental music]

37:17.569 --> 37:18.985
Goodnight, Diane.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.031
Goodnight.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.958
[car door opens]

37:33.001 --> 37:34.084
[car door shuts]

37:34.127 --> 37:36.378
[car engine starts]

37:41.802 --> 37:44.261
[instrumental music]

37:44.304 --> 37:46.054
[car engine revving]

37:52.437 --> 37:53.770
[chuckles]

37:54.815 --> 37:56.481
You're gonna see him again?

37:59.236 --> 38:02.362
Um...
Um, I mean, I don't know.

38:02.406 --> 38:06.366
I don't really have
a, a work function this month.

38:06.410 --> 38:07.826
I don't think so.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.661
You really like him, don't you?

38:09.705 --> 38:12.455
[chuckles]
No, I don't. I-I mean...

38:14.668 --> 38:16.001
I don't know.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.003
[Lori]
It's okay to have feelings.

38:18.046 --> 38:21.798
It's just, you know,
you did hire him.

38:21.842 --> 38:24.884
I don't want you to get hurt.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.556
No, I know.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.727
I think it's great that
you're opening up like this.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.229
You know, I think it's a sign.

38:36.273 --> 38:38.481
A sign for what?

38:38.525 --> 38:40.734
That you're ready
to start dating.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.491
[Diane chuckles]

38:50.537 --> 38:53.538
[siren wailing]

38:55.459 --> 38:58.460
[intense music]

38:59.629 --> 39:00.920
[exhales sharply]

39:06.803 --> 39:08.636
[music continues]

39:17.356 --> 39:18.646
[chuckles]

39:25.155 --> 39:28.114
I heard you crushed it
at the partner dinner.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.825
-From who?
-[mumbles] You know...

39:30.869 --> 39:32.285
I don't reveal my sources.

39:32.329 --> 39:34.412
-Oh, come on.
-Okay.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.456
I overheard Garrett
talking to Betty.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.084
-Garrett?
-Hm.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.835
What did he say?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.504
He said you crushed it.

39:42.547 --> 39:45.256
[sighs] God, I hope so.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.300
Let me tell you,
if I got this promotion,

39:47.344 --> 39:49.427
it would change everything.

39:49.471 --> 39:51.596
You know, Jake and I
are just getting by right now.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.431
It would mean more money,
more flexibility--

39:53.475 --> 39:56.810
-You're a shoe-in.
-You think so?

39:56.853 --> 39:58.395
No one works as hard as you.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.313
-[microwave beeping]
-[chuckles]

40:02.275 --> 40:04.818
And, uh, your boyfriend
seemed to be a hit.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.654
Garrett would not shut up
about his golfing prowess.

40:07.739 --> 40:08.947
Oh?

40:12.077 --> 40:14.702
You know,
he's not really my boyfriend.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.789
What, too soon for labels?

40:17.833 --> 40:21.084
No, I mean, we're not together.

40:24.381 --> 40:25.922
Well, have you ever heard
of this place called

40:25.966 --> 40:28.049
The Companionship Collective?

40:28.093 --> 40:29.801
Ew! The rent-a-date place?

40:29.845 --> 40:32.595
[laughs]
You make it sound so seedy.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.639
[laughs]

40:34.683 --> 40:36.141
No, I just,
I just didn't wanna go

40:36.184 --> 40:38.685
to this wine tasting alone,
you know?

40:38.728 --> 40:40.186
And now everyone thinks
that we're together

40:40.230 --> 40:43.273
and I just don't wanna
correct anyone.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.734
Please don't,
don't say anything.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.611
No. My lips are sealed.

40:49.406 --> 40:50.822
Thanks, Russell.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.533
Hm, hm.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.077
Diane?

40:57.747 --> 41:01.666
You know, next time
you could just ask me.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.679
Diane, update me
on the Barkley account.

41:14.723 --> 41:18.391
-It's right on schedule.
-Mm!

41:18.435 --> 41:20.310
Rumor is, the higher-ups
are getting antsy, sir.

41:20.353 --> 41:22.645
Seems they wanted
their final audit weeks ago.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.981
E-excuse me.
Rumors from where?

41:26.902 --> 41:28.985
If Diane is feeling
overwhelmed, sir,

41:29.029 --> 41:33.031
I can always take the ball
and run.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.782
Uh, this is
an important account, Diane.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.534
You sure you have everything
well in hand?

41:36.578 --> 41:38.953
Yes, I've spoken
to the executive director.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.747
And it's not just the audit,
they also want

41:40.790 --> 41:42.457
additional analysis
on market growth.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.251
But still, I'd rather not leave
them hanging too long.

41:45.295 --> 41:47.837
They won't be.
I've got it under control.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.883
[instrumental music]

41:53.470 --> 41:57.388
[Garrett] Okay. Russell,
what's happening with PG&N?

41:58.934 --> 42:01.851
Uh, yeah,
they, um, have been looking

42:01.895 --> 42:04.187
to improve their absorption cost
for the next fiscal year,

42:04.231 --> 42:05.813
and, uh, the numbers
are actually looking like

42:05.857 --> 42:07.148
they're gonna line up.

42:17.244 --> 42:20.245
You don't need to worry.
I've got it under control.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.539
-He has a lot of nerve.
-It's fine.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.999
He knows you're more talented,
so he tries to undermine.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.584
Well, he can try,

42:26.628 --> 42:28.670
but I'm determined
to not let him get to me.

42:32.342 --> 42:34.551
[doorbell rings]

42:46.523 --> 42:48.606
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.109
It's a bad time?

42:51.152 --> 42:55.446
Um, no, no.
I-I just wasn't expecting...

42:55.490 --> 42:56.990
Sorry, let me try this again.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.492
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:59.536 --> 43:01.578
So I was cleaning out my car
the other day

43:01.621 --> 43:04.664
and found this.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.791
Oh.

43:06.835 --> 43:10.003
Oh, I can't believe
I left this.

43:10.046 --> 43:12.213
Y-you know, you didn't have
to drive all this way...

43:12.257 --> 43:14.716
Oh, no, I know
how much it means to you.

43:15.427 --> 43:16.676
Thank you.

43:22.183 --> 43:24.225
[laughs]
I'm sorry.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.311
[sniffles]
So my allergies are acting up.

43:26.354 --> 43:29.147
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean,
I get anywhere near a cat

43:29.190 --> 43:30.732
and my eyes
just turn bright red.

43:30.775 --> 43:34.694
Um, can I trouble you
for a glass of water?

43:34.738 --> 43:37.071
Yeah, of course.
Please, come in.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.490
Thank you.

43:45.206 --> 43:47.123
I played a little in college.

43:47.167 --> 43:50.168
-Until I threw my shoulder out.
-Oh, really?

43:50.211 --> 43:51.961
I had a bunch
of minor league offers, too.

43:52.005 --> 43:53.296
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

43:53.340 --> 43:55.381
-From who?
-A bunch of clubs.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.471
Thank you,
I was telling Jake here

44:01.514 --> 44:03.348
that I went to college
on a baseball scholarship.

44:03.391 --> 44:06.309
Oh, yeah. He offered to show me
some pitches. Can he, mom?

44:06.353 --> 44:08.478
Yeah. It's no trouble. Really.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.899
-Sure.
-Yes! Come on.

44:12.942 --> 44:15.068
I've got an extra glove
in the garage.

44:21.034 --> 44:22.742
[Miles] Or I can follow through.

44:27.832 --> 44:29.248
[indistinct chatter]

44:38.843 --> 44:41.803
[indistinct chatter]

44:43.056 --> 44:44.597
Good catch.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.023
[indistinct chatter]

45:00.240 --> 45:04.367
[groans] I think I've read
this same page three times.

45:04.411 --> 45:07.537
It's lost all meaning.
Alright. We need a break.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.038
My eyes are fine.

45:09.082 --> 45:11.207
Well, it's almost noon.
Let's grab lunch.

45:11.251 --> 45:12.959
You know, I-I'd really
rather stay and finish.

45:13.002 --> 45:14.293
-Come on.
-It's okay.

45:14.337 --> 45:15.336
My treat.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.547
Diane, honey!

45:17.590 --> 45:19.757
These just came for you.

45:19.801 --> 45:22.051
-[Diane] Oh, my.
-And here's a card.

45:25.765 --> 45:28.057
I think you've found a keeper.

45:28.101 --> 45:29.851
Gotta hold on to that.

45:33.523 --> 45:36.482
From Miles? Your fake date?

45:36.526 --> 45:38.526
He stopped by last night
to drop something off.

45:38.570 --> 45:40.278
It's nothing.

45:40.321 --> 45:42.697
You went on one date, and
he's showing up at your home?

45:42.741 --> 45:44.365
We went out twice.

45:46.202 --> 45:48.369
I guess I didn't realize
it had become real.

45:49.539 --> 45:50.913
It's not.

45:53.918 --> 45:55.376
[Russell] You don't think
it's strange that he'd reach out

45:55.420 --> 45:57.670
to you after you hired him
to go to one event?

45:57.714 --> 45:59.464
He didn't reach out to me.

45:59.507 --> 46:02.133
I ran into him
at Jake's school.

46:02.177 --> 46:04.761
He's part of the, um,
Big Brother program there.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.598
And you believe that?

46:08.641 --> 46:09.974
Well, why wouldn't
I believe him?

46:10.018 --> 46:11.559
Because he lies for a living!

46:11.603 --> 46:14.395
Russell, that's not fair.

46:14.439 --> 46:16.063
-[scoffs]
-What?

46:18.359 --> 46:19.692
Nothing.

46:21.196 --> 46:23.237
Well, you obviously wanna say
something.

46:27.035 --> 46:30.161
I just want you to be careful.

46:30.205 --> 46:33.498
-Don't worry. I will be.
-Okay.

46:33.541 --> 46:36.542
[dramatic music]

46:42.509 --> 46:44.675
[Diane] Miles?

46:44.719 --> 46:47.094
-Hi. Diane, hey.
-Hi. Hi.

46:47.138 --> 46:49.972
What are you doing here?
Oh, are you, uh...

46:50.016 --> 46:52.225
You have
a Big Brother event today?

46:52.310 --> 46:54.018
No.

46:54.062 --> 46:56.938
Actually, Jake asked me
to come watch his practice.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.356
I hope that's okay.

46:59.651 --> 47:02.860
-Oh.
-I should have asked you first.

47:02.904 --> 47:04.237
-I wasn't thinking--
-[Jake] Mom! Mom!

47:04.280 --> 47:06.239
I struck out three guys
with my slider.

47:06.282 --> 47:07.990
-You did?
-Yeah. Did you see?

47:08.034 --> 47:09.867
-Honey, that's amazing.
-You're a natural, buddy.

47:09.911 --> 47:12.787
-You think?
-Yeah, yeah.

47:12.831 --> 47:14.247
-[laughs]
-[Miles] Yeah.

47:14.290 --> 47:16.624
Well, I think this calls
for a celebration, huh?

47:16.668 --> 47:18.084
-You want some hot dog?
-Yes!

47:18.127 --> 47:19.544
-Yes?
-Can you come?

47:19.587 --> 47:20.878
Um, you know, honey, I'm sure

47:20.922 --> 47:22.338
Miles has things he has to do.

47:22.382 --> 47:23.798
Miss out on the celebration?

47:23.842 --> 47:25.883
No. Yeah,
I can absolutely come. Yeah.

47:25.927 --> 47:27.844
Yes!

47:27.887 --> 47:29.929
-All right, um, sure. Yeah. No.
-Sure.

47:29.973 --> 47:32.181
That still works.

47:32.225 --> 47:35.017
-It's amazing, sweetie.
-Yeah.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.185
[indistinct chatter]

47:37.605 --> 47:39.313
[Miles] I used to do like
sauerkraut.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.649
-[Diane] Mm, sauerkraut. Relish.
-I didn't know...

47:41.693 --> 47:44.610
-I like both...
-Mustard, ketchup, a hot dog.

47:44.654 --> 47:46.821
-Yeah.
-Mustard, ketchup and a hot dog.

47:46.865 --> 47:48.447
[indistinct chatter]

47:48.491 --> 47:51.742
[Miles] Yeah.
[Jake] And a bun, obviously.

47:51.786 --> 47:54.871
Oh, it's the office,
I-I gotta take this.

47:54.914 --> 47:57.206
-All right, we'll order.
-It'll just take a minute.

47:57.250 --> 48:00.126
-It's on me. What do you want?
-Whatever you get.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.670
-You got it.
-Hello?

48:02.714 --> 48:04.505
[Betty on phone] Forrestor, Carlisle and Hobbes.

48:04.549 --> 48:06.132
Hi, Betty. Um, yes.

48:06.175 --> 48:08.759
I just got a message
saying it was urgent.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.720
Is, uh, Garrett
trying to reach me?

48:10.763 --> 48:12.513
[Betty] Oh, Mr. Garrett
already left for the day.

48:12.557 --> 48:16.350
It was Kyle.
I'll put you through.

48:16.394 --> 48:20.605
Diane, thanks for getting back
to me so quickly.

48:20.648 --> 48:21.772
[Diane] What's this about?

48:21.816 --> 48:23.065
You know, for the longest time

48:23.109 --> 48:25.067
I-I had trouble placing him.

48:25.111 --> 48:28.070
-Excuse me?
-[Kyle] Miles.

48:28.114 --> 48:31.157
My sister-in-law, she brought
him to a wedding last summer.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.036
Although, he introduced himself
as Benjamin.

48:35.079 --> 48:38.372
-I think you're mistaken.
-No. No.

48:38.416 --> 48:41.375
She was very open about using
The Companionship Collective.

48:41.419 --> 48:44.420
She didn't feel the need to
fool anyone with half-truths.

48:44.464 --> 48:46.505
I wasn't trying to fool anyone.

48:46.549 --> 48:48.841
But you did.

48:48.885 --> 48:50.635
I'm sure Garrett will be
very interested to hear

48:50.678 --> 48:53.429
you've been
actively deceiving him.

48:53.473 --> 48:55.973
Kyle, please don't say anything.

48:56.017 --> 48:58.935
[chuckles]
You're asking me to lie, Diane?

48:58.978 --> 49:01.771
No, I'm asking you
to be the better person.

49:01.814 --> 49:04.357
[sighs]

49:04.400 --> 49:06.359
I don't believe
that's in my best interest.

49:06.402 --> 49:07.818
Wait, Kyle...

49:07.862 --> 49:11.447
[chuckles]
I do enjoy her company.

49:11.491 --> 49:13.491
I hope you like spicy mustard.

49:15.954 --> 49:17.745
Is everything okay?

49:17.789 --> 49:19.288
That was Kyle.

49:19.332 --> 49:21.791
Hey, buddy, uh, can you go
grab us come napkins?

49:21.834 --> 49:23.084
Yeah.

49:26.005 --> 49:27.505
He knows who you are.

49:27.548 --> 49:28.798
He's planning to use it
against me.

49:28.841 --> 49:29.924
-He threatened you?
-Well...

49:29.968 --> 49:32.343
He's gonna go to my boss.

49:32.387 --> 49:34.428
I'll lose everything
I worked so hard for.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.640
-Hey, it'll be okay.
-How can you say that?

49:40.603 --> 49:42.019
I'm sorry,
I have to go deal with this--

49:42.063 --> 49:43.145
-Let me help.
-No. Really.

49:43.189 --> 49:44.689
There's nothing you can do.

49:46.067 --> 49:47.984
Sweetie, let's go.

49:48.027 --> 49:51.028
[dramatic music]

50:02.125 --> 50:04.500
-Don't forget to wash up. Okay?
-I won't.

50:06.254 --> 50:09.964
Hey, mom, thanks for inviting
Miles for my practice today.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.632
He really helped my pitch.

50:12.719 --> 50:15.469
-You didn't invite him?
-No.

50:29.235 --> 50:32.236
[intense music]

50:36.075 --> 50:37.324
[car door opens]

50:44.792 --> 50:47.793
[music continues]

50:53.843 --> 50:55.301
[Betty] Morning.

50:56.804 --> 50:59.263
-Hey, Betty.
-Hey.

50:59.307 --> 51:01.265
Um, is Garrett in?

51:01.309 --> 51:04.977
Yeah, in his office.
He was looking for you earlier.

51:06.189 --> 51:08.647
[sighs]
Okay. Thanks.

51:11.235 --> 51:12.568
Good luck.

51:12.612 --> 51:14.153
-[knocking on door]
-Sir.

51:15.490 --> 51:17.740
You wanted to see me?

51:17.784 --> 51:20.993
Yeah. Come on in. Have a seat.

51:23.247 --> 51:27.333
So I've been hoping to have
a little chat, you and I.

51:27.376 --> 51:30.002
Have you given much thought
to your future?

51:31.672 --> 51:34.799
-My future?
-Huh. Here at the company.

51:34.842 --> 51:37.718
-Did you talk to Kyle?
-No.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.888
I thought
I would speak to you first.

51:40.932 --> 51:43.474
I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

51:43.518 --> 51:47.103
and I think you would be
an ideal candidate for partner.

51:47.146 --> 51:48.479
Partner?

51:51.943 --> 51:55.820
I have been very impressed
with your work around here.

51:55.863 --> 51:59.115
You've become invaluable
in a very short time

51:59.158 --> 52:01.242
and I think
that you've earned it.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.119
Thank you very much.

52:03.162 --> 52:05.162
I-I don't even know what to say.

52:05.206 --> 52:07.331
Well, thank you is a good start.

52:07.375 --> 52:08.624
[laughs]

52:09.877 --> 52:11.877
-Thank you again.
-All right.

52:11.921 --> 52:13.379
Now get out of here
and do some work.

52:13.464 --> 52:14.588
Yes.

52:18.344 --> 52:20.427
[indistinct chatter]

52:20.471 --> 52:22.221
[cell phone ringing]

52:24.100 --> 52:26.142
Miles, hi.

52:26.185 --> 52:28.435
[Miles] Hey.
Just calling to check in.

52:28.479 --> 52:31.147
You were just pretty upset
yesterday when you left.

52:31.190 --> 52:32.815
I-is everything okay?

52:32.859 --> 52:35.151
Uh, yes. Thank you.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.653
I-I appreciate that.

52:37.697 --> 52:41.157
Actually, I got the promotion.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.950
[Diane] I guess
Kyle didn't say anything.

52:42.994 --> 52:45.327
That's great, Diane.

52:45.371 --> 52:47.371
We should celebrate.

52:47.415 --> 52:49.206
Um, you know, a-actually,

52:49.250 --> 52:50.833
I don't think
that's a good idea.

52:50.877 --> 52:52.251
[Miles] I think we owe it
to ourselves

52:52.295 --> 52:54.253
to see where this could go,
right?

52:56.591 --> 52:58.507
Take a chance with me, Diane.

53:01.137 --> 53:03.804
Tsk. Okay. When?

53:03.848 --> 53:07.433
You get lunch at 12:00, right?
Meet me at the park.

53:07.476 --> 53:09.852
-Front entrance?
-I'll see you there.

53:15.693 --> 53:16.734
Hey.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.404
[knocking]

53:20.448 --> 53:22.823
[muffled groaning]

53:24.327 --> 53:27.286
Gotta make this quick, buddy.
I have a date.

53:27.330 --> 53:29.455
[sobbing]

53:29.498 --> 53:31.332
-Was that Miles?
-Yeah, it was.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.542
I was talking with Betty.
Her son's a grade above Jake.

53:33.586 --> 53:37.296
She said Miles isn't a part
of the Big Brother program.

53:37.340 --> 53:39.798
-I don't understand.
-He's not being honest with you.

53:39.842 --> 53:41.717
I'm sure
there's an innocent explanation.

53:41.761 --> 53:43.093
I'll ask him when I see him.

53:43.137 --> 53:45.346
I know it's not my place
to say anything,

53:45.389 --> 53:46.847
but I think you should stay away
from this guy.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.391
You're right.
It isn't your place.

53:52.063 --> 53:55.064
[instrumental music]

53:58.110 --> 54:01.362
So I'm just a little confused.

54:01.405 --> 54:05.366
Betty told me that you aren't
part of the Big Brother program

54:05.409 --> 54:07.785
at school,
she said that there's no Miles.

54:07.828 --> 54:10.704
I have to tell you something,
and it's...

54:12.333 --> 54:16.168
I don't know how you're gonna
take this, but, uh,

54:16.212 --> 54:18.963
the agency insists
we use false names.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.801
False names?

54:23.844 --> 54:28.180
So you're not a Miles
or a Benjamin.

54:28.266 --> 54:29.640
No.

54:29.684 --> 54:31.308
That's why Betty was confused

54:31.352 --> 54:33.018
because she didn't know
your real name.

54:33.062 --> 54:34.603
I'm sorry for the deception.

54:34.647 --> 54:36.814
The, but the agency
just has really strict policies

54:36.857 --> 54:39.566
on what we share with clients.

54:40.069 --> 54:42.361
Clients?

54:42.405 --> 54:47.241
[sighs] I thought
we were becoming friends. I...

54:50.204 --> 54:52.663
Are you still
just playing a part with me?

54:52.707 --> 54:54.707
No. Not anymore.

54:59.672 --> 55:01.922
I-I'm sorry. I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

55:01.966 --> 55:03.882
No, I should have, I should have
told you on our second date.

55:03.926 --> 55:07.594
That-that's when I knew there
was something real between us.

55:07.638 --> 55:10.597
I'm Peter. Peter Dwyer.

55:14.270 --> 55:17.271
You see, it's my real name.

55:22.278 --> 55:23.694
Please stay.

55:30.244 --> 55:33.203
[intense music]

55:36.542 --> 55:38.250
What are you looking for?

55:39.420 --> 55:41.045
Ideally, a fourth for golf.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.254
Hm.

55:48.012 --> 55:51.055
[music continues]

56:01.776 --> 56:03.150
Gotcha.

56:04.070 --> 56:06.528
[music intensifies]

56:08.240 --> 56:09.907
[Diane] I guess
that when it comes to dating,

56:09.950 --> 56:12.743
I'm a little out of practice.

56:14.163 --> 56:16.330
Well, you went through
a traumatic event.

56:16.374 --> 56:17.915
It takes time.

56:23.047 --> 56:25.089
It must have been very hard.

56:27.259 --> 56:28.634
It was.

56:31.889 --> 56:33.680
It still is. I...

56:45.152 --> 56:48.946
You know, I don't even sleep in
the same bedroom since he died.

56:52.701 --> 56:54.743
I sleep in the guest bedroom.

56:58.833 --> 57:00.791
I haven't told anyone that.

57:04.046 --> 57:05.921
I'm glad you trust me.

57:15.975 --> 57:17.599
My wife...

57:19.478 --> 57:22.146
she had been working late
all week.

57:22.189 --> 57:23.647
It was a big project.

57:25.818 --> 57:27.526
She loved her job.

57:33.200 --> 57:34.908
She should have called me,
but she didn't.

57:34.952 --> 57:37.744
And she wrapped her car
around a tree going 50.

57:40.207 --> 57:41.874
She died instantly.

57:49.842 --> 57:51.675
I know that we got off
to a rocky start,

57:51.719 --> 57:53.844
but I want you to know that
I've been more real with you

57:53.888 --> 57:57.473
than anyone since my wife died.

57:57.516 --> 58:00.476
And I've been wanting to share
myself with you for a while now.

58:05.858 --> 58:07.858
Thank you for hearing me.

58:10.738 --> 58:13.405
I like being with you.
You make me happy.

58:13.449 --> 58:17.117
And I just haven't had that
for a long time.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.831
[dramatic music]

58:22.875 --> 58:25.501
-Russell, what--
-He's not who you think he is.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.628
-Who?
-Your companion.

58:27.671 --> 58:30.088
It's all been one big lie.
His name isn't even Miles.

58:30.132 --> 58:32.049
When I tried to hire him,
they told me his name was Greg.

58:32.092 --> 58:34.927
-When you tried to hire him?
-I was worried about you.

58:34.970 --> 58:37.471
That gives you no right
to insert yourself like this.

58:38.974 --> 58:41.892
And his name isn't even Greg
or Miles.

58:41.936 --> 58:44.061
It's Peter Dwyer, actually.

58:45.564 --> 58:48.440
-He told you?
-Yes.

58:48.484 --> 58:51.318
It's agency policy
to use fake names.

58:51.362 --> 58:53.570
Okay, but he let you think

58:53.614 --> 58:55.697
he was a completely different
person for weeks.

58:55.741 --> 58:58.033
-And you're just okay with that?
-Well, at first, of course not.

58:58.077 --> 59:01.245
But now that he's told me
the truth...

59:01.288 --> 59:04.665
If he's lying about his name,
what else is he lying about?

59:06.752 --> 59:09.753
[instrumental music]

59:19.348 --> 59:22.349
[birds chirping]

59:32.945 --> 59:35.779
-[Jake] Hey, mom?
-Mm-hmm.

59:35.823 --> 59:40.075
Can I, um, talk to you
about dad?

59:40.119 --> 59:43.078
[instrumental music]

59:44.164 --> 59:48.333
Of course, honey. What is it?

59:48.377 --> 59:50.794
Um, so we have, like,

59:50.838 --> 59:54.923
this presentation at-at school

59:54.967 --> 59:58.510
and, uh, we, like, have to

59:58.554 --> 1:00:01.972
talk about someone
that we look up to.

1:00:02.016 --> 1:00:04.099
And I wanna talk about dad.

1:00:06.145 --> 1:00:09.104
Honey, I think
that's really lovely.

1:00:10.649 --> 1:00:14.151
-When is it due?
-Not until next week.

1:00:17.656 --> 1:00:20.198
But when you're ready,
we can talk about it, okay?

1:00:25.664 --> 1:00:27.664
[school bus honking]

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:29.124
That's your school bus.

1:00:30.252 --> 1:00:32.878
-You got everything?
-Yeah.

1:00:32.921 --> 1:00:34.755
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

1:00:34.798 --> 1:00:36.089
Have a good day, sweetie.

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:37.424
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:00:42.056 --> 1:00:43.513
[door shuts]

1:00:46.852 --> 1:00:49.811
[school bus revving]

1:01:06.038 --> 1:01:09.039
[instrumental music]

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:30.435
[inhales sharply]

1:01:31.271 --> 1:01:34.106
[cell phone buzzing]

1:01:35.776 --> 1:01:37.109
[exhales sharply]

1:01:40.406 --> 1:01:42.531
-Hello?
-[Miles on phone] Hey!

1:01:42.574 --> 1:01:47.119
I had a really great time
the other day.

1:01:47.162 --> 1:01:51.498
I'm really glad that I was able
to open up to you like that.

1:01:51.542 --> 1:01:55.377
I just haven't been able
to do that with anyone else.

1:01:55.421 --> 1:01:59.297
And I was hoping that you would
let me take you out again.

1:02:01.927 --> 1:02:03.760
I don't,
I don't know, Miles. I...

1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:08.265
Did I do something?

1:02:08.308 --> 1:02:10.559
No, no. I just, I...

1:02:13.147 --> 1:02:14.354
The timing's wrong.

1:02:14.398 --> 1:02:17.232
[exhales]
What does that mean?

1:02:17.276 --> 1:02:20.110
I think you of all people
would understand.

1:02:20.154 --> 1:02:22.195
Come on, please, just, uh...

1:02:23.824 --> 1:02:26.158
don't give up on this.

1:02:26.201 --> 1:02:30.787
Look, I, I thought I was ready,
but I'm-I'm just, I'm not.

1:02:30.831 --> 1:02:32.497
-Diane...
-I'm sorry.

1:02:32.541 --> 1:02:33.707
Just let me...

1:02:33.751 --> 1:02:35.000
Lis...

1:02:35.043 --> 1:02:36.084
God!

1:02:50.434 --> 1:02:51.683
[sniffles]

1:03:02.613 --> 1:03:03.904
Knock, knock.

1:03:08.035 --> 1:03:10.160
It's an apology.

1:03:10.204 --> 1:03:12.370
I had no right
to talk about your love life.

1:03:13.665 --> 1:03:14.790
But?

1:03:16.335 --> 1:03:18.835
No but. I'm sorry.

1:03:21.799 --> 1:03:23.256
Thank you.

1:03:27.095 --> 1:03:30.263
You know, just so you know,
I ended it.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:33.725
Really?

1:03:33.769 --> 1:03:36.102
What kind of relationship
starts on a lie?

1:03:36.897 --> 1:03:37.938
Hm.

1:03:43.362 --> 1:03:44.986
My grandparents
lied to each other for years.

1:03:45.030 --> 1:03:46.238
[Diane chuckles]

1:03:47.783 --> 1:03:50.617
-Like your tie.
-Thank you.

1:03:50.661 --> 1:03:51.952
That's the truth.

1:03:55.666 --> 1:03:58.667
[intense music]

1:04:05.217 --> 1:04:06.383
Hey.

1:04:07.469 --> 1:04:09.344
Miles.

1:04:09.388 --> 1:04:11.805
What are you doing here?

1:04:11.849 --> 1:04:14.599
You're not answering
my phone calls.

1:04:14.643 --> 1:04:16.685
Right. I thought
I made myself clear.

1:04:16.728 --> 1:04:18.144
I thought you felt the same way
as me.

1:04:18.188 --> 1:04:21.857
Look, so did I, but I...
I'm sorry. It's just--

1:04:21.900 --> 1:04:23.149
Hey, come on.
We'll just, we'll go inside.

1:04:23.193 --> 1:04:24.276
-We'll talk about this.
-No, please.

1:04:24.319 --> 1:04:26.152
Just... I can't.

1:04:26.196 --> 1:04:27.654
So what,
you're just gonna end it?

1:04:27.698 --> 1:04:29.155
Because I thought
we were being honest

1:04:29.199 --> 1:04:31.408
with each other,
I was connecting with Jake--

1:04:31.451 --> 1:04:33.577
Hey! Leave Jake out of this.

1:04:33.620 --> 1:04:35.120
-Okay?
-No, I'm sorry. Hey.

1:04:35.163 --> 1:04:37.497
Listen,
I told you everything about me.

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:39.040
No, I actually don't know
who you are.

1:04:39.084 --> 1:04:41.126
-What else do you want from me?
-Miles, stop.

1:04:41.169 --> 1:04:42.627
-[Diane] Miles, stop.
-Diane!

1:04:42.671 --> 1:04:44.421
Stop!

1:04:44.464 --> 1:04:46.047
Is everything okay?

1:04:47.426 --> 1:04:49.467
[panting]

1:04:52.723 --> 1:04:54.097
What was that?

1:04:55.475 --> 1:04:57.559
Let's just go inside, Lori.

1:04:57.603 --> 1:04:59.185
[dramatic music]

1:04:59.229 --> 1:05:01.980
[door creaks]

1:05:07.070 --> 1:05:08.236
[sighs]

1:05:11.783 --> 1:05:16.661
[sighs] Okay, it doesn't look
like he took anything, so...

1:05:16.705 --> 1:05:18.246
Do you really think
he was inside?

1:05:18.290 --> 1:05:19.956
Oh, I don't know,
but I never leave

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.541
that front door open.

1:05:23.170 --> 1:05:25.128
-Could it have been Jake?
-No, no.

1:05:25.172 --> 1:05:27.756
He's spending the night
at a friend's house.

1:05:27.799 --> 1:05:30.175
How much do you know
about this guy, anyway?

1:05:30.218 --> 1:05:31.801
Well, at this point,
I have no idea.

1:05:31.845 --> 1:05:34.054
All right.

1:05:34.097 --> 1:05:36.431
Let's find out exactly
who we're dealing with.

1:05:40.312 --> 1:05:42.979
Let's see who you really are,
Peter Dwyer.

1:05:46.944 --> 1:05:48.985
That's apparently a common name.

1:05:51.448 --> 1:05:52.906
He said his wife's name
was Jennifer

1:05:52.950 --> 1:05:56.117
and that she died
in a-a car accident.

1:05:57.704 --> 1:06:00.163
Bingo. Okay.

1:06:00.207 --> 1:06:03.667
"Couple involved in car
accident. Husband survives.

1:06:03.710 --> 1:06:06.962
Suspicious circumstances
surrounding the accident."

1:06:07.005 --> 1:06:11.216
He-he said
she was driving home alone.

1:06:11.259 --> 1:06:12.842
Do you want me
to stay here tonight?

1:06:12.886 --> 1:06:14.719
No, no. I'm-I'm okay.

1:06:14.763 --> 1:06:16.680
I don't think
you should be alone tonight.

1:06:16.723 --> 1:06:18.723
Let's go to dinner.

1:06:18.767 --> 1:06:20.225
[Diane] Okay.

1:06:24.356 --> 1:06:27.857
[indistinct chatter]

1:06:28.944 --> 1:06:31.277
[indistinct radio chatter]

1:06:31.321 --> 1:06:32.862
What are the police doing here?

1:06:32.906 --> 1:06:35.657
Oh, they're asking questions
about Kyle.

1:06:36.702 --> 1:06:38.702
Is he okay?

1:06:38.745 --> 1:06:40.912
He's been missing
for a few days.

1:06:40.956 --> 1:06:43.373
His girlfriend filed
a police report this morning.

1:06:54.928 --> 1:06:56.136
[indistinct chatter]

1:06:57.347 --> 1:06:59.222
He came to my house yesterday.

1:06:59.266 --> 1:07:00.640
What?

1:07:00.684 --> 1:07:02.183
When I told him I didn't wanna
see him anymore,

1:07:02.227 --> 1:07:03.727
he didn't take it well.

1:07:03.770 --> 1:07:05.103
Diane.

1:07:06.857 --> 1:07:09.065
He was there when Kyle called.

1:07:11.111 --> 1:07:13.236
He knew Kyle threatened me.

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:16.197
Do you really think he's capable
of hurting someone?

1:07:16.241 --> 1:07:17.490
No.

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:20.285
I-I don't know.

1:07:22.414 --> 1:07:24.080
Everything I thought
I knew about this person

1:07:24.124 --> 1:07:26.416
turned out to be a lie.
I mean...

1:07:26.460 --> 1:07:28.168
Who did I let into my life?

1:07:28.211 --> 1:07:30.587
Maybe it's time we take this
to the police.

1:07:30.630 --> 1:07:32.672
And say what, the man I hired

1:07:32.716 --> 1:07:34.632
to be someone else
turned out to be someone else?

1:07:34.676 --> 1:07:36.676
If you think he possibly
had anything to do

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:39.095
with Kyle's disappearance,
we have to, don't we?

1:07:42.267 --> 1:07:44.726
I'm gonna be late.
I have to pick up Jake.

1:07:57.532 --> 1:08:00.492
[dramatic music]

1:08:00.535 --> 1:08:03.745
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

1:08:03.789 --> 1:08:06.247
Your mom asked me
to come pick you up today.

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:07.749
Um, she didn't mention it.

1:08:07.793 --> 1:08:09.876
Uh, it probably
slipped her mind.

1:08:11.797 --> 1:08:13.546
Doesn't sound like her.

1:08:13.590 --> 1:08:17.467
Well, you know
how busy she's been.

1:08:17.511 --> 1:08:19.803
You hungry?
You wanna get some hot dogs?

1:08:21.139 --> 1:08:23.431
-Come on.
-All right.

1:08:23.475 --> 1:08:24.766
All right.

1:08:27.771 --> 1:08:31.189
I think it'd be good if they put
cheese in the hot dog...

1:08:31.233 --> 1:08:34.234
[indistinct chatter]

1:08:55.966 --> 1:08:58.049
[chuckles]
Got that fly ball.

1:08:59.094 --> 1:09:00.885
-Betty, hey.
-Hey.

1:09:00.929 --> 1:09:03.596
Hey, uh, h-have you seen Jake?
Is he still here? Wh...

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:05.974
No. He already left.

1:09:06.017 --> 1:09:08.685
-With who?
-With Miles.

1:09:10.647 --> 1:09:12.230
Oh, you didn't know?

1:09:13.191 --> 1:09:14.858
I-I'm sorry, Betty. I-I...

1:09:16.611 --> 1:09:17.902
Diane!

1:09:20.198 --> 1:09:23.283
[sighs]
Come on.

1:09:23.326 --> 1:09:24.826
Of course,
I spoke to the police.

1:09:24.870 --> 1:09:26.619
They told me to just stay home

1:09:26.663 --> 1:09:27.996
and wait for them to contact me,

1:09:28.039 --> 1:09:29.622
but I don't know
how I'm supposed to stand...

1:09:29.666 --> 1:09:31.541
[glass shatters]

1:09:31.585 --> 1:09:34.544
-[Lori on phone] Diane?
-Let me call you back.

1:09:34.588 --> 1:09:35.837
[Lori] Why? Wait.

1:09:36.923 --> 1:09:39.924
[music playing on earphones]

1:09:42.137 --> 1:09:43.803
Oh, Jake.

1:09:43.847 --> 1:09:46.139
[sighs] Oh, sweetie.

1:09:46.183 --> 1:09:48.224
-Sorry, it slipped.
-Oh, God.

1:09:48.268 --> 1:09:49.767
Oh, you're here.

1:09:49.811 --> 1:09:51.936
-Yeah?
-Honey.

1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:54.397
What were you thinking
taking a ride from Miles?

1:09:54.441 --> 1:09:57.108
He said that you told him
to pick me up.

1:09:57.152 --> 1:09:59.611
What's the matter?
I thought you liked him.

1:09:59.654 --> 1:10:01.696
Honey,
that has nothing to do with it.

1:10:01.740 --> 1:10:04.240
Why are you freaking out
about this?

1:10:04.284 --> 1:10:06.743
Honey,
I need you to promise me

1:10:06.786 --> 1:10:08.661
that you will never go anywhere
with anyone

1:10:08.705 --> 1:10:09.913
unless I give you permission.

1:10:09.956 --> 1:10:11.956
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:10:13.752 --> 1:10:16.169
-I mean it.
-Okay.

1:10:19.299 --> 1:10:21.424
Sorry, sweetie.
I'm just worried about you.

1:10:24.554 --> 1:10:27.096
Did Miles say anything to you?

1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:29.015
Like what?

1:10:29.059 --> 1:10:32.560
I don't know.
Anything strange?

1:10:32.604 --> 1:10:34.479
You're the only one
being strange right now, mom.

1:10:34.522 --> 1:10:36.064
Miles is really cool.

1:10:45.575 --> 1:10:48.493
Yes. I am very relieved.
Thank you, officer.

1:10:48.536 --> 1:10:49.786
[car honks]

1:10:51.498 --> 1:10:53.414
-Danny's here.
-Have everything you need?

1:10:53.458 --> 1:10:55.375
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah? Pajamas? Toothbrush?

1:10:55.418 --> 1:10:58.044
-Mm-hmm. Mom, I gotta go.
-Listen, just...

1:10:58.088 --> 1:10:59.504
I know things have been hard.

1:10:59.547 --> 1:11:01.673
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

1:11:01.716 --> 1:11:02.924
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:11:02.968 --> 1:11:04.968
Whenever you need.

1:11:05.011 --> 1:11:06.844
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

1:11:07.806 --> 1:11:09.597
[car honking]

1:11:09.641 --> 1:11:11.015
-All right.
-Okay.

1:11:12.143 --> 1:11:14.394
-Bye, sweetie.
-Okay, bye.

1:11:14.437 --> 1:11:17.522
[instrumental music]

1:11:21.611 --> 1:11:22.819
[Danny] Hey, Jake.

1:11:23.530 --> 1:11:24.696
[car door shuts]

1:11:26.241 --> 1:11:28.700
[car engine revving]

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:46.843
[instrumental music]

1:11:49.848 --> 1:11:51.806
[gasps]
... Lori.

1:11:51.850 --> 1:11:53.099
You didn't call me back.
Is Jake okay?

1:11:53.143 --> 1:11:54.809
Yes, he's fine.

1:11:54.853 --> 1:11:57.562
He's fine. Oh, my God.

1:11:58.648 --> 1:11:59.814
What about a restraining order?

1:11:59.858 --> 1:12:01.107
I've already filed a complaint

1:12:01.151 --> 1:12:02.817
with the police.

1:12:02.944 --> 1:12:04.235
I mean, aside from picking

1:12:04.279 --> 1:12:05.153
my son up from school,

1:12:05.196 --> 1:12:06.904
he hasn't really done anything.

1:12:06.948 --> 1:12:08.906
He lied about who he is.

1:12:08.950 --> 1:12:11.492
He threatened you.

1:12:11.661 --> 1:12:13.828
He lied about how his wife died.

1:12:15.373 --> 1:12:17.415
Yeah, but we don't have
any evidence.

1:12:17.459 --> 1:12:21.461
He's dangerous.
It's escalating behavior.

1:12:21.504 --> 1:12:24.380
At the very least, call
The Companionship Collective.

1:12:25.633 --> 1:12:27.008
Lodge a complaint.

1:12:27.052 --> 1:12:29.052
Let them know
what's been going on.

1:12:31.389 --> 1:12:32.680
You're right.

1:12:37.812 --> 1:12:39.312
[cell phone dialing]

1:12:43.401 --> 1:12:45.109
Hello?

1:12:45.153 --> 1:12:48.196
Hi, yes.
Uh, this is Diane Cooper.

1:12:48.239 --> 1:12:53.034
Um, I've been seeing
one of your companions, Miles,

1:12:53.078 --> 1:12:55.995
and, uh, I need to speak
to your supervisor

1:12:56.039 --> 1:12:57.538
about him right away.

1:13:03.922 --> 1:13:05.838
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay,

1:13:05.882 --> 1:13:07.757
especially with Jake being gone?

1:13:07.801 --> 1:13:10.885
-No, really, I'm fine.
-I can cancel my study group.

1:13:10.929 --> 1:13:13.888
-They'll understand.
-Absolutely not.

1:13:13.932 --> 1:13:15.515
I'll see you at brunch tomorrow.
Okay?

1:13:15.558 --> 1:13:16.724
Okay.

1:13:18.812 --> 1:13:20.645
Goodnight, sis.

1:13:20.688 --> 1:13:21.938
Goodnight.

1:13:23.691 --> 1:13:26.692
[intense music]

1:13:46.047 --> 1:13:47.255

1:14:21.291 --> 1:14:24.292
[dramatic music]

1:14:41.144 --> 1:14:42.351
Robert?

1:14:43.855 --> 1:14:45.021
I'm right here.

1:14:56.868 --> 1:14:59.869
[birds chirping]

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:05.666
[Diane sighs]

1:15:09.172 --> 1:15:11.005
[sighs]

1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:14.425
I dreamt you went away.

1:15:14.469 --> 1:15:16.427
I would never leave you.

1:15:17.639 --> 1:15:19.972
[intense music]

1:15:20.016 --> 1:15:21.390
[gasps]

1:15:25.939 --> 1:15:27.855
No, no, we don't have
to fight it any longer.

1:15:27.899 --> 1:15:29.357
What are you doing here?

1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:32.109
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1:15:32.153 --> 1:15:34.946
I know you've been scared
of moving on.

1:15:34.989 --> 1:15:37.031
That's why
we couldn't be together.

1:15:40.286 --> 1:15:41.661
[dramatic music]

1:15:43.790 --> 1:15:45.456
I gave you a fresh start,
you don't have

1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:46.958
to be trapped by the past
anymore, Diane.

1:15:47.001 --> 1:15:48.543
-Please, just let me go. Please.
-It's me.

1:15:48.586 --> 1:15:51.087
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1:15:51.130 --> 1:15:53.214
[panting]

1:15:53.258 --> 1:15:56.634
It's okay. It's okay.

1:15:56.678 --> 1:15:57.593
You did all this for me?

1:15:57.637 --> 1:15:59.762
Oh, for us.

1:15:59.806 --> 1:16:03.474
Uh, not just that. You...
Oh, God. Kyle...

1:16:03.518 --> 1:16:04.600
Oh.

1:16:05.436 --> 1:16:07.979
He threatened you.

1:16:08.022 --> 1:16:11.148
So you took care of it for me.

1:16:11.192 --> 1:16:12.483
I did.

1:16:20.702 --> 1:16:22.034
Okay.

1:16:23.246 --> 1:16:24.495
Okay.

1:16:25.456 --> 1:16:26.706
Okay.

1:16:27.875 --> 1:16:29.292
You're right.

1:16:32.005 --> 1:16:34.422
I thought
I wasn't ready to move on,

1:16:34.465 --> 1:16:35.548
but I...

1:16:37.885 --> 1:16:39.885
You deserve some honesty.

1:16:43.808 --> 1:16:45.099
Okay.

1:16:52.150 --> 1:16:53.608
So here it is.

1:17:01.242 --> 1:17:02.992
Sometimes I hate him...

1:17:05.413 --> 1:17:06.704
my husband...

1:17:10.209 --> 1:17:12.168
for leaving me behind.

1:17:15.757 --> 1:17:19.717
He said it was forever,
and here I am, alone.

1:17:19.761 --> 1:17:22.094
Uh, you're not alone.
You're not.

1:17:31.939 --> 1:17:34.357
Did you feel that way
with your wife?

1:17:34.484 --> 1:17:35.733
[gasps]

1:17:35.777 --> 1:17:37.026
No.

1:17:38.237 --> 1:17:40.029
Okay.

1:17:40.073 --> 1:17:42.239
I guess you're a better person
than I am.

1:17:47.872 --> 1:17:49.538
You really loved her.

1:17:50.291 --> 1:17:51.666
I did.

1:17:55.213 --> 1:17:57.296
Did she even appreciate you?

1:18:03.805 --> 1:18:06.555
Did she even know
how lucky she was

1:18:06.599 --> 1:18:09.725
to have you
and all of your devotion?

1:18:13.731 --> 1:18:15.648
Did she lie to you, Peter?

1:18:15.692 --> 1:18:17.316
Don't call me that.

1:18:19.278 --> 1:18:21.654
Did she break promises
with you, Peter?

1:18:23.491 --> 1:18:25.324
She said she loved me...

1:18:26.285 --> 1:18:29.161
but she was betraying me.

1:18:29.205 --> 1:18:32.248
And when I found out,
I had to do something about it.

1:18:34.168 --> 1:18:35.793
So you confronted her.

1:18:35.837 --> 1:18:38.838
Didn't even deny it.

1:18:38.881 --> 1:18:43.217
I told her we could work through
it, but she just... laughed.

1:18:43.261 --> 1:18:47.138
She was gonna walk out on me,
on our life.

1:18:51.477 --> 1:18:53.561
I couldn't let that happen.

1:18:56.899 --> 1:18:58.441
I understand.

1:19:03.781 --> 1:19:08.409
We let all these people in
just so they can disappoint us.

1:19:12.373 --> 1:19:15.332
[instrumental music]

1:19:17.128 --> 1:19:18.753
I know why you did it...

1:19:19.922 --> 1:19:21.839
why you killed her.

1:19:21.883 --> 1:19:23.257
I had to.

1:19:29.766 --> 1:19:31.724
It will be different with us.

1:19:37.023 --> 1:19:38.481
[gasps]

1:19:38.524 --> 1:19:40.065
Yes, it will.

1:19:40.777 --> 1:19:42.318
Wait, wait.

1:19:43.738 --> 1:19:45.738
Let me just freshen up.

1:19:45.782 --> 1:19:49.241
I just, I want this moment
to be perfect.

1:19:59.212 --> 1:20:02.588
Why don't you find
something for us to listen to?

1:20:03.257 --> 1:20:04.715
Of course.

1:20:12.642 --> 1:20:15.309
[whimpering]

1:20:27.156 --> 1:20:30.157
[music playing on speakers]

1:20:53.349 --> 1:20:55.140
[knocking on door]

1:20:55.184 --> 1:20:57.434
Is everything okay in there?

1:20:57.478 --> 1:20:59.144
Um, yeah.

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:02.106
Uh, you know,
I just remembered

1:21:02.149 --> 1:21:05.067
that my, um, sister's
coming over for breakfast today

1:21:05.111 --> 1:21:06.443
and I...

1:21:07.113 --> 1:21:08.279
I, uh...

1:21:10.575 --> 1:21:12.199
Can't wait to meet her.

1:21:13.369 --> 1:21:15.786
[music playing on speakers]

1:21:15.830 --> 1:21:20.749
I just don't want her
to interrupt us.

1:21:20.793 --> 1:21:23.127
We need to start building trust
again, Diane.

1:21:23.963 --> 1:21:25.588
Can we do that?

1:21:27.008 --> 1:21:28.090
Of course.

1:21:28.134 --> 1:21:31.135
[music playing on speakers]

1:21:33.139 --> 1:21:35.347
I'm so glad
you've come into my life.

1:21:38.895 --> 1:21:41.729
Everything is wonderful now
since I've met you.

1:21:41.772 --> 1:21:42.771
Ah!
