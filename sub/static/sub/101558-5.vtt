<i>The housekeeper knew, more than most,</i>

01:17.500 --> 01:19.541
<i>that deep experience was never peaceful,</i>

01:20.083 --> 01:23.416
<i>and because she knew this</i>
<i>ever since she'd first called Bly home,</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:25.708
<i>she would always find</i>
<i>her way back to peace </i>

01:25.791 --> 01:27.208
<i>within her daily routine,</i>

01:27.833 --> 01:29.333
<i>and it had always worked.</i>

01:30.708 --> 01:31.583
<i>Always.</i>

01:32.083 --> 01:34.333
[Owen] We can't count on the past.

01:36.625 --> 01:38.791
We can't count on the past.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.375
That's what I learned taking care of Mum.

01:43.875 --> 01:46.750
Hm. It's kind of what dementia is,
isn't it?

01:49.333 --> 01:51.083
I suppose I learned a lot on this.

01:51.625 --> 01:55.833
I mean, we-- we think we have it
trapped in our memories, but…

01:57.375 --> 01:59.500
memories fade, or they're wrong.

02:00.916 --> 02:03.750
Any of us could die, at any moment.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.458
Or we could forget our entire lives,
which is like dying.

02:07.958 --> 02:10.416
So, then, think about it.

02:11.875 --> 02:14.166
We can't count on our future, either.

02:17.833 --> 02:18.708
No past.

02:19.250 --> 02:20.208
No future.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.791
Oh, my God,
it's scary, I know, but, Owen…

02:25.916 --> 02:26.916
you're young.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.583
Like, you have a past, you have a future.

02:30.666 --> 02:33.166
Now, I'd argue you can count on both.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.250
Poor, sweet, drunk man.

02:42.125 --> 02:43.958
-Know what I noticed?
-What?

02:45.791 --> 02:49.458
You spend a lot of time
caring for other people.

02:49.541 --> 02:50.708
It's my job.

02:50.791 --> 02:51.750
Nah.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.750
It's more than that, isn't it?

02:54.833 --> 02:57.666
I mean, if you could
just take that responsibility,

02:57.750 --> 02:59.333
and put it down for a minute…

03:00.083 --> 03:00.916
I mean, I can.

03:01.833 --> 03:02.666
Fuck it.

03:03.625 --> 03:04.458
I-- [sighs]

03:05.041 --> 03:06.791
I'm sorry to say it, hm?

03:07.291 --> 03:08.250
I shouldn't say it.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.958
It's-It's-It's a horrible thing to say,
but I'll say it.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.375
It's a bit of a relief.

03:18.958 --> 03:20.000
It's not horrible.

03:22.875 --> 03:25.500
I'm untethered now,
whether I like it or not.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.541
And now I'm thinking…

03:31.041 --> 03:33.375
[exhales heavily]
…maybe I'll go back to Paris.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.333
Well, you, um…

03:39.083 --> 03:39.916
I mean, you…

03:40.625 --> 03:42.458
You could, couldn't you? You…

03:42.541 --> 03:44.125
-I could.
-Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:45.833
And you know…

03:49.500 --> 03:50.666
you could, too.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.166
[scoffs]

03:53.958 --> 03:56.416
[chuckling]

03:57.666 --> 03:58.958
Say it with me.

03:59.458 --> 04:04.333
-Hannah Grose in Paris.
-[Hannah] What would I do in Paris?

04:04.916 --> 04:07.958
Eat croissants
and-and drink good wine.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.166
And live, Hannah.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.541
Live.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.583
Do whatever the hell occurs to us
in the bloody moment.

04:16.958 --> 04:17.916
You and me.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.083
While we still can.

04:26.250 --> 04:29.333
[Jamie] So sorry to interrupt,
but I'm turning into a pumpkin.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.625
Come on, Owen. Time to go home.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.791
[Owen]
All right, well, it's about that time.

04:37.541 --> 04:38.708
[sighs]

04:40.666 --> 04:42.083
I'll-co-hol you later.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.625
God, even for you.

04:46.875 --> 04:47.708
Drive safe.

04:47.791 --> 04:49.708
[Jamie]
I know the road. We'll be fine.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.000
It's all good.

05:03.708 --> 05:04.875
[Owen] <i>Are you Hannah?</i>

05:06.666 --> 05:07.833
Uh, Owen Sharma.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.250
It's so nice to meet you.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.083
Right.

05:13.833 --> 05:14.791
Right, yes.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.875
Sorry,
I-I'm a little discombobulated today.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.583
And, typically, job interviews aren't my…

05:21.666 --> 05:24.541
Well, I'm… I'm far more comfortable
on the other side of the table.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.291
-[chuckles]
-But Charlotte, um, Mrs. Wingrave,

05:27.375 --> 05:28.666
she had to, um…

05:29.375 --> 05:30.208
She had to…

05:33.291 --> 05:35.166
Right, yes. Well, I'm… I'm all set.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.625
Hannah Grose. It's a…

05:36.708 --> 05:38.166
It's a pleasure, please do…

05:40.875 --> 05:42.083
So, um, you…

05:42.916 --> 05:45.125
You-you studied in… in Paris?

05:46.833 --> 05:48.791
-Uh, yes. Uh, for, for two years.
-Oh.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.083
Yeah. Best two years of my life,
if I'm honest.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.125
I worked in a restaurant in Le Marais.

05:53.833 --> 05:54.666
Oh, uh…

05:55.291 --> 05:57.375
Well, I'm afraid this job might bore you.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.500
I'm sure there's a posh restaurant
that could use you.

06:00.583 --> 06:01.416
I mean…

06:02.291 --> 06:03.583
why do you want to work at Bly?

06:04.083 --> 06:06.541
-Because it's close to home.
-Oh, well, that's honest.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.958
Well, I-I'm… I'm too honest.
It's, it's probably pathological.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.041
No, honesty is never that.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.416
I'm, I'm looking at this
as an opportunity to hone my skills.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.958
In-In Paris, I was a sous-chef,

06:17.041 --> 06:19.083
which means
they only let me chop vegetables.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.791
Here, I'll put everything together myself.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.000
It would be a…
a great learning experience.

06:23.708 --> 06:25.833
Well, you'll have two children
to cook for.

06:25.916 --> 06:28.250
I'm not sure
that's the type of experience you want.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.791
Miles is seven, and, well, picky.
Flora's five, and…

06:32.541 --> 06:34.583
a darling. They both are, really.

06:35.083 --> 06:37.291
The Wingraves,
they're here for holidays and summers.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.000
They've been good to me.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.500
And-And, look, I know it sounds
very <i>Upstairs, Downstairs, </i>but…

06:42.708 --> 06:45.041
this is my home,
and I take great pride in it.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.791
We need a cook
who intends to stay on for a while.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.125
Well, um…

06:50.375 --> 06:51.333
when my mum…

06:53.000 --> 06:55.500
That-That is, um, when it's time to…

06:56.833 --> 06:57.666
Uh…

06:58.208 --> 06:59.375
God, I wasn't gonna say this.

06:59.458 --> 07:00.541
Um…

07:00.625 --> 07:01.958
But it's part of it, I guess,

07:02.041 --> 07:04.125
if you wanna know
why I'm applying for this.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.333
Yesterday, my-my mother thought
it was 1962.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.125
And that I was my grandfather.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.875
And that's why I'm here.

07:15.541 --> 07:17.541
To make a living while I mind her, and…

07:18.208 --> 07:20.583
I don't know how long that will, um…

07:21.666 --> 07:23.541
But I won't go running off.
[chuckles]

07:24.375 --> 07:27.000
I-I promise you that.
That's-- That's not who I am.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.708
It must be very difficult.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.083
It-It is.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.333
Uh, and it isn't.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.125
[tender music playing]

07:36.958 --> 07:39.458
Have y-- Have you read Thomas Merton?

07:40.041 --> 07:41.083
Oh, um…

07:41.166 --> 07:43.000
No, I'm-- I'm afraid not.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.416
-Tell me.
-Well, he-he was a… He was a monk.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.333
Oh.

07:46.416 --> 07:47.416
He said,

07:47.500 --> 07:50.791
once we get past consciousness,
and identity,

07:50.875 --> 07:53.833
and-and all of the things
that occupy the front of our brains…

07:54.958 --> 07:55.791
you…

07:57.791 --> 07:59.250
reach a transcendence…

08:00.541 --> 08:03.750
an infinitely abundant source,
or what have you.

08:05.416 --> 08:09.083
So, if you take someone
with dementia, for instance,

08:09.166 --> 08:12.416
and-and their consciousness
is wearing away every day, right?

08:13.291 --> 08:16.166
You see underneath it, and it's…

08:18.750 --> 08:19.583
Look, I…

08:20.166 --> 08:22.500
I don't know if it's transcendent,

08:23.333 --> 08:24.166
but I'm…

08:24.916 --> 08:26.583
learning a lot about being alive.

08:27.666 --> 08:28.583
[chuckles]

08:28.666 --> 08:29.541
I mean, a lot.

They're here.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.291
Hi, Mrs. Grose.

09:37.375 --> 09:40.333
Hello, Flora, darling.
Now, have you had a fine school year?

09:40.916 --> 09:44.041
-[Charlotte] Careful! Straight upstairs.
-[Hannah] Off she goes.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.041
God, who am I kidding?

09:45.125 --> 09:47.041
They haven't heard a word
I've said all day.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.333
How are things?

09:48.416 --> 09:51.208
Oh, well, you know, uh,
same as always, ma'am.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.375
[man] Mrs. Grose. Lovely to be back.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.166
Oh, lovely to have you back, sir.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.083
Hello, Hannah.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.541
-Lovely to see your face.
-And yours, too, sir.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.916
We'll have tea this week.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.500
You'll tell me all about
how numbingly constant everything is.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.666
[chuckling] Well, I should like that
very much, ma'am.

[clicking continues]

10:11.458 --> 10:12.625
Um…

10:12.708 --> 10:14.791
You'll bring those in directly, will you?

10:17.416 --> 10:18.291
Immediately.

I'm, uh…

sorry, ma'am. I…

11:28.416 --> 11:29.250
I…

11:30.500 --> 11:31.750
I thought you'd left.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.166
You usually leave before…

11:35.875 --> 11:37.291
Is Sam coming to get you?

11:39.875 --> 11:40.708
No.

11:41.458 --> 11:42.583
Is he all right?

11:45.833 --> 11:47.666
I don't know how he could be, ma'am.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.583
Apparently, he is… Apparently, he's…

11:52.000 --> 11:53.125
He's just fine.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.416
Somehow, him and…

whoever she is, they're…

They're just fine.

Oh, my.

12:06.750 --> 12:07.625
Oh, my.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.291
I can arrange a ride for you.

12:12.166 --> 12:16.416
Surely, you're not walking back to town,
surely. I'll arrange a ride.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.416
-Or take you myself.
-No, really, I'm…

12:19.291 --> 12:21.125
Or you can stay here, you know.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.208
For as long as you like.

12:23.916 --> 12:25.291
Forever, if you need to.

Oi!

13:25.250 --> 13:27.875
-Stop it!
-[Hannah] Miles! Stop that this instant!

13:29.416 --> 13:31.958
That is not funny, mate.
Don't ever do that again, you hear me?

13:32.541 --> 13:35.208
Or I will beat the living shite
out of you. No bullshit.

13:35.666 --> 13:37.333
I will fucking end you.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.291
Try me.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.250
Look at you, all flushed.

Any of us could die at any moment.

14:11.333 --> 14:14.291
Or we could forget our entire lives,
which is like dying.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.333
So, then, think about it.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.416
We can't count on our future, either.

14:22.666 --> 14:23.583
No past.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.083
No future.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.291
Our moments are supposed to be like…

14:30.916 --> 14:31.916
Chapters.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.041
No, um…

14:35.500 --> 14:36.375
Markers?

14:39.250 --> 14:40.583
No, that's not it, is it?

14:41.583 --> 14:42.416
They're not.

14:43.625 --> 14:44.500
They're like…

14:46.666 --> 14:47.500
Like…

14:59.208 --> 15:00.625
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

15:00.708 --> 15:02.041
[footsteps approaching]

15:03.708 --> 15:04.541
Pardon me.

15:11.791 --> 15:12.875
[Flora] Wait, please!

15:13.625 --> 15:15.083
-[Peter] Hiya!
-[Flora] Peter!

15:15.166 --> 15:17.625
[Rebecca] It's nearly lunchtime.
To the kitchen, immediately.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.541
You can play with Uncle Peter later.

15:22.958 --> 15:26.541
Uh, slow down, or you'll break
your bloody skulls!

15:30.625 --> 15:33.458
-[Rebecca] Don't touch me!
-[Peter speaking indistinctly]

15:34.875 --> 15:36.916
You can't just talk to me
like I'm some kind of whore,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.750
disappear and then come back,
and try and act like everything is normal.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.583
-That won't fly with me!
-[Peter] What?

15:41.666 --> 15:44.166
You talk to me like rubbish,
and I haven't heard from you in days!

15:44.250 --> 15:46.583
-[Peter] Keep it down.
-[Rebecca] Don't tell me what to do!

15:46.666 --> 15:48.958
[Peter] I'm not. I just don't understand
why you're upset.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.250
[Rebecca] Last time I saw you,

15:50.333 --> 15:53.416
you were banging on
about me having Owen's batter in my mouth.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.375
[Peter sighs]

15:55.458 --> 15:57.833
Oh, come on.
I forgot all about that, Becs.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.666
-I didn't.
-Becs, I… [sighs]

16:01.875 --> 16:03.458
Look, okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

16:04.083 --> 16:04.916
I'm sorry.

16:05.708 --> 16:06.541
Come here.

16:07.916 --> 16:09.666
Please. Hey.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.041
I don't even know who that was.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.125
I'm just in deeper than I thought,
I guess.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.750
You don't get to talk to me
like that again.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.125
No, never. Never.

16:26.208 --> 16:27.833
I pr-- I promise. I do.

16:27.916 --> 16:28.750
I promise.

16:29.750 --> 16:30.583
Okay?

16:31.291 --> 16:32.208
Okay.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.208
-Okay?
-Mm-hm.

16:34.750 --> 16:35.583
Can I kiss you?

16:35.666 --> 16:37.166
[giggles]

16:38.208 --> 16:39.666
[kissing]

16:39.750 --> 16:41.083
[door creaks]

16:48.333 --> 16:50.333
[vacuum turns on, whirs loudly]

16:59.333 --> 17:00.833
[kicks vacuum off]

17:00.916 --> 17:01.958
Honestly, Hannah.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.333
You should give the vacuum a rest.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.125
Live a little.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.125
[eerie music playing]

17:32.541 --> 17:33.375
[jarring thud]

17:37.833 --> 17:39.500
[drawer creaks open]

17:49.416 --> 17:51.416
-[ominous thud]
-[Peter chuckles]

17:52.125 --> 17:54.125
Hannah. You scared me.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.125
What are you doing up here?

17:58.416 --> 18:00.416
Henry asked me to pick up a few things.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.458
What, from Charlotte's vanity?

18:04.833 --> 18:06.500
Well, he's a sentimental bloke.

18:07.541 --> 18:08.958
Show what's in your pocket.

18:10.666 --> 18:13.125
Jesus, Hannah, buy me dinner first.

18:17.458 --> 18:18.291
Very well.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.291
So, Henry asked <i>you</i> to get that for him?

18:24.958 --> 18:25.875
That's right.

18:25.958 --> 18:26.791
Hm.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.791
-What does he want with that?
-I don't know.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.666
-I'm just following orders.
-Uh-huh.

18:32.166 --> 18:36.333
You know, Charlotte once told me
that necklace is over 400 years old.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.166
It's probably worth thousands.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.083
Hm.

18:40.708 --> 18:42.875
Well, you wouldn't think it
looking at it, would you?

18:42.958 --> 18:44.416
You wouldn't have guessed.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.833
Funny thing
about cleaning a house for years.

18:46.916 --> 18:48.750
You know exactly where everything is.

18:48.833 --> 18:52.416
Henry might be too much of a mess
to notice what you're up to,

18:52.500 --> 18:53.333
but I'm not.

18:53.416 --> 18:56.625
-And what am I up to?
-You're taking things that aren't yours.

19:02.708 --> 19:03.583
[chuckles softly]

19:08.041 --> 19:09.333
You know… [clears throat]

19:11.458 --> 19:13.458
…it's a mistake, isn't it?

19:15.416 --> 19:17.541
Thinking that they're your family.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.291
That this is your house.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.541
There's them,
and then there's us, Hannah.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.500
We're the help.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.875
What do you suppose happens
when you're told to push a mop?

19:34.666 --> 19:37.250
What? You think Henry
will take care of you?

19:37.916 --> 19:38.916
Or what? The kids?

19:40.041 --> 19:43.000
Do you know many housekeepers
who stay on after they retire?

19:45.166 --> 19:47.291
Their lives go on, Hannah.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.250
Leaving honest people like us
in its wake.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.333
Honest, are you?

19:53.958 --> 19:54.791
[scoffs]

19:55.458 --> 19:57.083
I'll have the necklace, please.

20:05.750 --> 20:06.583
Here.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.500
Thank you.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.250
You know… [clears throat]

20:16.458 --> 20:18.208
…you should be nicer to me, Hannah.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.541
I mean, one word from me, and…

20:22.125 --> 20:24.750
you'll be thrown out
with nothing but your last week's wages.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.833
This is my home, Peter Quint.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.541
You'll leave long before I do.

20:31.625 --> 20:32.500
[lighter clicks]

20:36.208 --> 20:37.083
[clicks shut]

20:45.916 --> 20:47.916
[wind whistles eerily]

20:50.041 --> 20:51.958
[water dripping]

20:52.041 --> 20:54.125
[terrifying music playing]

20:57.958 --> 20:59.958
[footsteps]

21:13.750 --> 21:14.875
[terrifying crescendo]

21:21.500 --> 21:23.500
[chilling music playing]

21:27.208 --> 21:28.333
[music crescendos abruptly]

21:28.416 --> 21:31.500
[Owen] I'm looking at this
as an opportunity to hone my skills.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.208
In Paris, I was a sous-chef,

21:33.291 --> 21:35.291
which means
they only let you chop vegetables.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.375
Here, I'll be putting together
everything myself.

21:37.458 --> 21:39.583
It'd be a great learning experience.

21:40.041 --> 21:42.166
You'll have two children to cook for, and…

21:44.458 --> 21:45.833
So, I'm sorry. Um…

21:47.875 --> 21:50.041
This is--
It's going to sound strange, but…

21:51.166 --> 21:52.750
haven't we already done this?

21:55.916 --> 21:56.750
Yes.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.416
But we have to do it again.

22:01.083 --> 22:01.916
Why?

22:03.916 --> 22:05.041
You tell me.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.000
What?

22:07.750 --> 22:08.583
It's okay.

22:09.375 --> 22:10.250
Let's get back to it.

22:10.333 --> 22:13.125
In Paris, I was a sous-chef,
which means you can only cut vegetables.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.500
Here, I'll be putting
everything together myself.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.500
It'll be a great learning experience.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.041
Um…

22:21.375 --> 22:23.250
You'll have two children to cook for.

22:23.958 --> 22:26.416
I don't know if that's the type
of experience you want.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.500
-Miles is seven and rather picky--
-Miles?

22:29.958 --> 22:32.250
-[Hannah] Mm.
-Tell me more about him.

22:33.333 --> 22:34.500
What kind of boy is he?

22:35.500 --> 22:36.375
Oh.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.666
-Oh, Miles is a good boy.
-Huh.

22:40.791 --> 22:41.625
He's sweet.

22:42.958 --> 22:45.541
He's troubled, but deep down,
oh, he's a good boy.

22:45.625 --> 22:46.500
Troubled?

22:46.583 --> 22:49.375
Yeah, he hasn't been the same
since his parents died.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.750
But then what child would be?

22:52.583 --> 22:53.625
Is he ever cruel?

22:54.458 --> 22:56.375
Whatever would make you say that?

22:57.125 --> 22:59.291
Little boys can be very cruel.

23:00.458 --> 23:01.583
I should know.

23:01.666 --> 23:04.000
-I was one.
-Oh, Miles is a good boy.

23:04.541 --> 23:05.833
So you said.

23:05.916 --> 23:06.750
He is.

23:06.833 --> 23:08.000
He is a good boy,

23:08.083 --> 23:10.416
-and he would never do anything to--
-Hurt you.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.833
Is that what you were gonna say?

23:12.333 --> 23:14.875
-Whatever would make you say that?
-I don't know, you asked.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.666
Okay, okay, he wouldn't hurt you.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.625
But you admitted
he hasn't exactly been himself

23:20.708 --> 23:21.875
since his parents died.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.416
No, that's not what I meant.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.250
[yelling] Miles Wingrave!

23:26.333 --> 23:28.041
What do you think you're doing?

23:28.541 --> 23:29.375
Hey.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.833
-[lighter clicks]
-What on earth has gotten into you?

23:32.541 --> 23:34.541
Enjoying a fag on a nice, sunny day.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.291
What are <i>you</i> doing?

23:39.333 --> 23:40.250
[sighs]

23:40.750 --> 23:41.750
Listen, Miles…

23:42.833 --> 23:44.208
Look, I know you miss Peter,

23:44.833 --> 23:47.416
and-and I know it's confusing
the way he's run off.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.375
If you wanna keep his lighter,
it's okay with me,

23:49.458 --> 23:50.875
as long as you're safe with it.

23:51.375 --> 23:54.625
But you cannot, under any circumstances,
be smoking.

23:54.708 --> 23:56.708
Or do you want to die
a horrible, choking death, hm?

23:57.791 --> 23:59.750
[chuckles] Oh, Hannah.

24:00.666 --> 24:01.500
Honestly.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.083
Uh, Miles.

24:05.166 --> 24:06.125
[lighter clicking]

24:07.125 --> 24:07.958
Honestly.

24:09.958 --> 24:10.791
Miles!

24:11.958 --> 24:13.625
Miles, we're not finished here.

24:15.875 --> 24:16.708
Miles!

24:17.208 --> 24:18.041
Oh, God.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.125
Miles!

24:22.708 --> 24:23.833
Oh, hello.

24:23.916 --> 24:26.291
Oh, hello. Did Miles come in here?

24:26.833 --> 24:27.666
Just now.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.416
Come have a seat.

24:33.916 --> 24:36.166
Oh, I lit it for you.
I hope you don't mind.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.541
Who is it for?

24:41.125 --> 24:42.541
Well, that's the spirit!

24:42.625 --> 24:44.083
Moving on and moving up.

24:44.666 --> 24:45.708
That's for Sam.

24:46.375 --> 24:49.166
He may not be dead,
but nobody's perfect, are they?

24:49.250 --> 24:50.333
[laughs]

24:51.083 --> 24:53.791
I didn't think you lit
remembrance candles for the living.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.125
Oh, you don't normally.

24:55.583 --> 24:57.500
But, for him, a special case.

24:58.416 --> 25:00.375
Come sit,
I want to talk to you about something.

25:00.458 --> 25:01.291
Oh.

25:06.041 --> 25:10.458
What would you say
to making your position live-in?

25:11.541 --> 25:12.416
Oh, uh…

25:14.041 --> 25:15.083
[both laugh]

25:16.166 --> 25:18.875
-I'd have to sell my house.
-Precisely.

25:19.541 --> 25:21.625
And that would be
a lovely nest egg for you.

25:21.708 --> 25:24.291
And we would compensate you accordingly,
of course.

25:24.916 --> 25:26.208
Oh, but Sam…

25:26.291 --> 25:28.541
Well, we light that candle for him,
don't we?

25:30.958 --> 25:32.208
Because Sam is gone.

25:32.291 --> 25:33.708
Because Sam is gone.

25:36.916 --> 25:38.625
I appreciate the offer.

25:38.708 --> 25:40.458
Really, I do, Charlotte, but, um…

25:41.125 --> 25:41.958
Sam is…

25:42.458 --> 25:44.125
He's just going through a phase.

25:44.625 --> 25:45.583
And he'll be back.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.000
He will.

25:49.791 --> 25:50.666
He will be back.

25:51.916 --> 25:53.333
[Charlotte] It's funny.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.375
Marriage is like religion, in a way.

25:58.250 --> 26:02.666
You are told to have blind faith in God,
even though you can't see him.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.958
And you're told
to have blind faith in your husband,

26:06.041 --> 26:07.833
even if you hardly ever see him.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.791
But is that realistic?

26:11.833 --> 26:14.416
How long can you actually believe
in something?

26:14.916 --> 26:16.416
I mean, truly believe in it,

26:17.166 --> 26:18.166
without seeing it.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.375
They both have their limits
in that regard.

26:21.916 --> 26:23.416
Well, what's the alternative?

26:24.458 --> 26:25.458
Believe in nothing?

26:26.291 --> 26:27.166
Then what?

26:27.250 --> 26:30.166
What have you got when your back's
against the wall when there's…

26:30.250 --> 26:32.250
nothing left for you but faith?

26:33.166 --> 26:34.000
I mean, I…

26:35.583 --> 26:37.500
I still love him.

26:38.958 --> 26:40.458
God help me, I do.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.083
I still love him.

26:44.583 --> 26:45.791
And what he did was…

26:45.875 --> 26:47.333
It was horrible, but…

26:49.916 --> 26:50.750
Yes.

26:51.791 --> 26:52.750
Yes, it was.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.666
[Rebecca] <i>I used to be a Daddy's girl.</i>

26:58.750 --> 27:00.750
[bells tolling in distance]

27:02.791 --> 27:03.625
What?

27:04.166 --> 27:06.708
Until, of course,
I grew up and I wasn't anymore.

27:07.791 --> 27:11.375
I was a woman with my own opinions,
desires, and aspirations,

27:11.458 --> 27:13.791
and my father
didn't much encourage those.

27:16.250 --> 27:20.333
As far as he was concerned,
my dreams were far out of my reach.

27:21.541 --> 27:24.541
And he felt I needed
to be reminded of that constantly.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.541
So, when you find someone…

27:29.666 --> 27:31.250
who truly sees you,

27:31.333 --> 27:32.833
who truly believes in you,

27:32.916 --> 27:35.083
sometimes more
than you believe in yourself,

27:35.708 --> 27:37.708
that you are smart enough,

27:37.791 --> 27:39.958
and capable enough, and tells you so…

27:40.583 --> 27:43.125
well, you hold on to them,
and you don't let go.

27:44.791 --> 27:47.166
Even if they're rough around the edges.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.375
Even if they're not perfect.

27:50.708 --> 27:52.791
Even if you lose yourself just a little.

27:53.208 --> 27:55.750
You don't have to lose yourself
to find happiness, you know.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.166
Don't you, though?

27:57.916 --> 27:59.250
I mean, we all do it.

27:59.833 --> 28:01.750
Not always. No.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.208
I know what you're going to say, so don't.

28:06.291 --> 28:09.041
Well, if you know what I'm gonna say,
then you know why I'd say it.

28:09.125 --> 28:10.750
Look, I know. I know, okay?

28:12.250 --> 28:14.250
I've never met anyone like him.

28:14.333 --> 28:17.000
-I know he's not perfect.
-More than that, though, isn't it?

28:18.208 --> 28:20.166
Forgive me for saying so, Rebecca, but…

28:21.125 --> 28:22.375
he scares the shit out of me.

28:25.041 --> 28:27.625
You don't know him, Hannah.
You don't.

28:33.791 --> 28:35.041
He scares me, too.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.958
But in the best way.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.000
Being with him
might be scary at times, but…

28:43.875 --> 28:45.875
it's also exciting, and fun.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.750
And for the first time in my life,

28:47.833 --> 28:51.291
that little voice in my head saying
I'm not good enough has disappeared.

28:51.375 --> 28:52.250
It's gone.

28:53.083 --> 28:55.000
And I've never felt so alive.

28:56.708 --> 28:57.666
Oh, darling.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.708
Hey, there's a difference

29:02.208 --> 29:05.375
between feeling good and feeling alive.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.833
The two aren't always the same.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.458
I mean, look at you.

29:12.875 --> 29:15.583
You look like you haven't slept
for a week.

29:16.958 --> 29:17.833
[sighs]

29:18.500 --> 29:20.416
You worry too much, okay?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.708
-I've been with men like him before.
-No.

29:23.666 --> 29:26.750
No, that's not true. You told me yourself.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.208
You told me
you've never met anyone like him before.

29:29.291 --> 29:31.041
And you don't get to have it both ways.

29:31.625 --> 29:32.625
Hannah, honestly.

29:33.375 --> 29:34.500
[sighs in frustration]

29:34.583 --> 29:35.416
Rebecca.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.750
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.208
Rebecca.

29:45.000 --> 29:45.916
[gasps]

29:46.625 --> 29:48.583
[ominous music playing]

29:50.583 --> 29:52.375
[breathes heavily]

29:52.458 --> 29:53.958
[water dripping]

29:54.041 --> 29:55.041
[lighter clicking]

30:05.291 --> 30:06.125
[Owen] <i>Hey.</i>

30:07.000 --> 30:08.708
Let me get your opinion, Rebecca.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.166
More salt in the stew?

30:11.000 --> 30:11.833
What?

30:13.333 --> 30:14.541
What are you stewing on?

30:15.166 --> 30:16.083
[Rebecca] Um…

30:16.833 --> 30:17.666
Um…

30:17.750 --> 30:19.625
No, thank you. I'm… I'm not hungry.

30:21.000 --> 30:21.833
Huh.

30:22.333 --> 30:25.333
The sweetest honey
is loathsome in its own deliciousness.

30:25.833 --> 30:29.208
And in its taste confounds the appetite.

30:29.291 --> 30:30.708
It smells delicious in here.

30:31.291 --> 30:33.375
Um, Becs, can I borrow you a moment?

30:39.041 --> 30:40.583
[Rebecca giggling]

30:42.625 --> 30:44.708
[Hannah]
We had a mouse problem a few years back.

30:45.541 --> 30:47.708
The old gardener
brought in these glue traps.

30:47.791 --> 30:50.583
A tile about yea big, coated in glue.

30:51.625 --> 30:53.583
No springs, no cage.

30:54.375 --> 30:56.083
No violence. That's what he said.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.458
No violence.

30:59.958 --> 31:00.833
A few days later,

31:00.916 --> 31:03.291
I come across one of these traps,
and there's something in it.

31:03.375 --> 31:06.041
Something quite small.
Not-Not a mouse, mind. Um…

31:06.791 --> 31:08.458
A caterpillar, I thought, maybe.

31:09.791 --> 31:11.625
And I pick it up, I look at it.

31:13.791 --> 31:14.625
It was a leg.

31:15.750 --> 31:16.833
Bloody mouse leg.

31:17.958 --> 31:21.375
Poor mouse was a few feet away.
It chewed its own leg off to escape.

31:22.666 --> 31:24.166
The poor thing bled to death.

31:27.791 --> 31:29.291
That man is a glue trap.

31:30.708 --> 31:33.875
And when Rebecca realizes it,
she won't come out whole, she'll just…

31:36.333 --> 31:37.541
She'll think she's okay.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.125
Till she realizes she's stuck.

31:44.916 --> 31:45.750
Denial.

31:49.958 --> 31:50.875
[jarring crescendo]

31:50.958 --> 31:53.125
I'm looking at this
as an opportunity to hone my skills.

31:53.208 --> 31:56.083
In Paris, I was a sous-chef, which means
they only let me chop vegetables.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.041
Here, I'd be putting together
everything myself.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.666
It'd be a great learning experience.

32:01.625 --> 32:02.458
Uh…

32:03.083 --> 32:05.041
We need a cook
who intends to stay on for a while.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.500
Oh, when the time comes,
I won't go running off.

32:08.708 --> 32:09.708
I promise you that.

32:11.458 --> 32:12.291
No.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.041
I'll be stuck in this glue trap of a town
just like everyone else.

32:18.208 --> 32:21.541
-You're familiar with glue traps.
-We talked about that once.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.041
Not yet, we haven't.

32:24.208 --> 32:25.125
Technically.

32:27.750 --> 32:30.000
But I thought about it
for weeks after we did.

32:30.791 --> 32:32.750
Thought about what that must feel like.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.291
That glue…

32:35.500 --> 32:36.750
setting in…

32:37.916 --> 32:39.250
before we really know it.

32:41.583 --> 32:43.000
That bottomless,

32:44.083 --> 32:45.750
icy terror…

32:47.000 --> 32:49.416
realizing that we may be stuck forever.

32:50.250 --> 32:53.291
Do you think a mouse
is capable of that kind of realization?

32:56.666 --> 32:59.083
Does a mouse know when it's already over?

33:01.083 --> 33:01.916
Do we?

33:03.250 --> 33:04.083
We?

33:05.833 --> 33:06.666
People.

33:08.833 --> 33:12.916
Do we realize when we're in the glue?
Or when the water around us is boiling?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.166
Or do we sit there,

33:14.666 --> 33:16.333
saying this will be okay?

33:17.666 --> 33:18.583
I'm okay.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.125
[yelling] Denial!

33:21.208 --> 33:22.333
[panting]

33:23.208 --> 33:24.041
That's morbid.

33:24.541 --> 33:26.875
God, that's what this is.
This is… This is morbid.

33:27.958 --> 33:29.500
-Be careful.
-It's morbid!

33:32.208 --> 33:34.208
[clock ticking]

33:49.041 --> 33:50.166
[Rebecca moans softly]

33:51.250 --> 33:52.916
[Rebecca] Mm-mm.

33:53.000 --> 33:53.958
Stay.

33:54.041 --> 33:56.208
[Peter chuckles]
I have to be at the bank in the morning.

33:56.291 --> 33:58.166
[Rebecca] Just stay a bit longer, please.

33:58.250 --> 33:59.416
[Peter] I wish I could.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.416
I have to tell you something.

34:07.541 --> 34:08.375
What?

34:09.916 --> 34:11.916
[somber music playing]

34:13.333 --> 34:14.166
What is it?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.833
I've never had anything in my life.

34:22.541 --> 34:23.375
I've never had…

34:24.291 --> 34:26.041
money, or, um…

34:26.750 --> 34:27.583
a family…

34:28.500 --> 34:29.333
or…

34:32.125 --> 34:32.958
love.

34:33.458 --> 34:34.291
Or safety.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.208
Until I found you.

34:41.708 --> 34:42.625
What's going on?

34:44.208 --> 34:45.541
I'm doing something big.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.166
Something big for both of us.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.083
[Rebecca] You're not making much sense.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.708
We're not like them, Becs.

34:56.208 --> 34:57.416
Okay? We're not.

34:58.291 --> 35:00.541
Henry's never gonna give you
the pupilage.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.125
He's never gonna make me a partner.

35:02.791 --> 35:05.166
The only thing
the English care about is class.

35:06.625 --> 35:07.625
And you and I…

35:08.541 --> 35:11.208
we're always gonna be the help,
in their eyes.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.333
Aren't we?

35:15.250 --> 35:16.958
And we both know that, deep down.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.375
But the only thing Americans care about…

35:22.250 --> 35:23.083
is money.

35:24.833 --> 35:25.666
And…

35:27.083 --> 35:28.583
if I had enough of that…

35:29.083 --> 35:30.166
in the States,

35:31.083 --> 35:34.166
I mean, you can be
whatever kind of lawyer you want.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.375
I can be anything at all.

35:37.291 --> 35:40.666
And we-- The things that we could be,
in America.

35:43.166 --> 35:44.291
With money.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.416
Do you understand what I'm saying?

35:48.583 --> 35:49.583
So, I…

35:50.250 --> 35:52.750
I need you to pack your bags
and be ready to go.

35:52.833 --> 35:54.625
-Tomorrow night.
-What are you talking about?

35:54.708 --> 35:56.333
-I can't just--
-Please, please.

35:56.416 --> 35:58.000
Please, just do that for me.

35:58.916 --> 36:01.500
And I promise,
I'll explain everything when I get back.

36:02.000 --> 36:02.916
But you trust me?

36:04.041 --> 36:05.000
Yes, I--

36:10.416 --> 36:11.458
You be ready to go.

36:13.375 --> 36:15.333
And don't tell anyone.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.708
Anyone. You understand?

36:18.416 --> 36:20.291
There's a few things for me to do,

36:20.375 --> 36:23.250
and then I'm coming back here for you,
I promise.

36:25.166 --> 36:26.000
I promise.

36:27.875 --> 36:28.708
I love you.

36:31.833 --> 36:33.166
We're getting out of here.

36:35.416 --> 36:38.208
We're getting out of here.

36:42.041 --> 36:45.333
The things that we're gonna be,
you and I,

36:45.916 --> 36:46.750
in America.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.125
Ohh… A lord…

36:49.916 --> 36:51.083
and his lady.

36:51.166 --> 36:55.166
No, a queen and her stable boy.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.625
[laughing]

37:00.541 --> 37:01.375
All right.

37:10.958 --> 37:12.791
This is one of my favorites.

37:17.750 --> 37:21.291
I don't find myself in this one
too often, but… [sighs]

37:21.916 --> 37:23.083
…I like it when I do.

37:24.791 --> 37:25.666
Because he is…

37:26.125 --> 37:26.958
[sighs]

37:27.750 --> 37:29.208
Well, you saw.

37:29.291 --> 37:31.208
He's so much himself in this one.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.250
Before it went bad.

37:39.541 --> 37:41.791
I haven't seen you
in this one before, though.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.791
What are you doing here? Ho--

37:44.875 --> 37:47.375
-How did you slip into my--
-I-I'm so sorry.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.666
-Miss, I'm so--
-No, I wouldn't go out there.

37:50.750 --> 37:52.708
I think this is when it happened.

37:53.708 --> 37:55.833
I can never bring myself to watch.

37:55.916 --> 37:58.750
-I-I… I'm so sorry, Miss--
-Hannah!

37:59.250 --> 38:00.250
I'm so sorry.

38:01.791 --> 38:03.291
[Peter] What are you doing up?

38:04.541 --> 38:05.375
I…

38:07.833 --> 38:09.083
What, you couldn't sleep?

38:10.708 --> 38:11.666
We heard something.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.375
Something downstairs.

38:16.458 --> 38:17.750
And Flora's doll house, well…

38:18.625 --> 38:19.666
something strange.

38:21.916 --> 38:22.916
I'm sure it's fine.

38:23.541 --> 38:25.416
Go on back to bed, both of you.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.916
[drawer unlocking]

38:59.916 --> 39:01.000
[drawer opening]

39:31.083 --> 39:31.916
[sighs]

39:32.416 --> 39:34.541
I thought I said go back to bed.

39:34.625 --> 39:35.666
[jarring thud]

39:35.750 --> 39:36.583
[Peter grunting]

39:36.666 --> 39:37.708
[Miles screaming] Peter!

39:38.458 --> 39:39.541
No, Miles, stay here.

39:40.041 --> 39:42.166
[sinister music playing]

39:45.958 --> 39:47.083
[Peter choking]

39:54.750 --> 39:55.708
[thud]

40:10.291 --> 40:11.666
[frightening musical swell]

40:11.750 --> 40:13.000
[music stops abruptly]

40:16.208 --> 40:18.041
I thought I said go back to bed.

40:21.916 --> 40:23.083
What's with the faces?

40:24.416 --> 40:25.500
Come on, back to bed.

40:28.541 --> 40:29.625
What happened?

40:30.625 --> 40:32.833
-What do you mean?
-What did she do to you?

40:33.833 --> 40:34.666
Who?

40:35.125 --> 40:35.958
Rebecca?

40:39.125 --> 40:41.625
You're a bit too young to hear, my lad.
[chuckles]

40:44.750 --> 40:45.583
What's that?

40:47.125 --> 40:48.000
It's…

40:50.166 --> 40:51.000
the lady.

40:52.375 --> 40:53.208
From the lake.

40:55.041 --> 40:55.875
She's…

40:57.833 --> 40:58.916
Don't you remember?

41:02.250 --> 41:03.250
[haunting gust]

41:09.208 --> 41:10.041
[Peter grunts]

41:17.750 --> 41:19.916
[chuckles nervously] What?

41:24.833 --> 41:26.750
No, no, no. No, no, no.

41:31.333 --> 41:32.208
[chuckles softly]

41:34.958 --> 41:36.958
[chuckling]
She's a creepy little thing, though.

41:37.791 --> 41:40.291
-[Flora] Hm.
-Did you make that yourself?

41:42.833 --> 41:43.958
I've seen her before.

41:45.458 --> 41:46.291
The others…

41:47.291 --> 41:48.125
they say…

41:48.625 --> 41:49.875
"Stay away from her."

41:52.000 --> 41:52.833
What others?

41:53.833 --> 41:55.958
[slow footsteps in distance]

41:59.083 --> 42:00.041
Oh, no.

42:00.541 --> 42:01.666
She's coming back.

42:04.625 --> 42:06.625
[wet footsteps approaching]

42:19.916 --> 42:20.750
[Peter] Stop.

42:22.541 --> 42:23.375
[yells] Stop!

42:24.083 --> 42:25.291
Stop, let me go.

42:29.000 --> 42:29.833
[clattering]

42:31.500 --> 42:33.375
Let me go! Let me go!

42:34.041 --> 42:35.791

43:59.416 --> 44:00.416
-Ah!
-[cracking sound]

44:00.500 --> 44:02.416
[Owen] This as an opportunity
to hone my skills.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.666
In Paris, I was a sous-chef,
so I only cut vegetables.

44:05.750 --> 44:07.416
Here, I'll be doing everything myself.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.083
-It'll be a-a great learning experience.
-Again?

44:10.166 --> 44:12.666
-Yes, apparently, we're doing this again.
-Why?

44:12.750 --> 44:14.375
[sighs heavily] You tell me.

44:14.458 --> 44:16.041
I mean, this is all you.

44:16.125 --> 44:17.708
I'm you, aren't I?

44:17.791 --> 44:20.708
We've been doing this
since it happened, haven't we?

44:22.625 --> 44:24.208
I'm sorry, uh… [sniffles]

44:24.291 --> 44:25.708
I'm having a difficult time.

44:27.458 --> 44:28.666
Owen, is it?

44:32.041 --> 44:32.875
You know what?

44:34.541 --> 44:35.833
Sure. Yes.

44:37.125 --> 44:38.625
-Owen.
-You see, um…

44:39.291 --> 44:41.208
I'm having the strangest of dreams.

44:41.291 --> 44:43.125
-Are you?
-Yes, I am, but…

44:46.083 --> 44:47.208
they're so strange.

44:48.083 --> 44:49.750
I'm having somebody else's dream.

44:49.833 --> 44:51.041
To sleep,

44:51.125 --> 44:53.000
to sleep perchance to dream.

44:54.125 --> 44:56.416
Ay, there's the rub.

44:57.083 --> 44:58.458
For in that sleep of death,

44:58.541 --> 45:00.375
what dreams may come

45:01.041 --> 45:03.416
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil.

45:07.041 --> 45:07.875
What dreams?

45:08.750 --> 45:10.625
Oh, well, of Peter.

45:10.708 --> 45:11.541
And of, um…

45:14.041 --> 45:15.500
I don't know, actually, um…

45:16.625 --> 45:17.458
A woman.

45:17.541 --> 45:19.000
Okay. So, a woman in bed with him.

45:19.083 --> 45:20.083
Oh, my!

45:21.375 --> 45:23.666
-This woman I've not met before, have I?
-Haven't you?

45:23.750 --> 45:24.625
Oh…

45:25.333 --> 45:26.458
Rebecca.

45:26.541 --> 45:28.750
It's two years away.

45:31.875 --> 45:32.833
Not yet, huh?

45:35.458 --> 45:37.666
Needs to cook a little longer, I think.

45:39.083 --> 45:39.916
All right, then.

45:40.875 --> 45:41.708
One more time.

45:42.708 --> 45:44.750
-You are Hannah Grose.
-Yes.

45:44.833 --> 45:46.833
The year is 1987.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.333
You're at Bly.

45:49.375 --> 45:51.291
Dominic is dead, Charlotte is dead.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.416
Rebecca is dead.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.541
Peter is missing.

45:56.291 --> 45:57.125
You think.

45:57.833 --> 45:58.875
Flora is eight.

46:00.708 --> 46:01.708
And Miles…

46:03.458 --> 46:07.166
Something is wrong with Miles.

46:32.416 --> 46:34.625
You step away from that boy,
do you hear me?

46:35.083 --> 46:37.500
The police have been looking
and looking for you,

46:37.583 --> 46:39.666
and when they find out that you're back…

46:40.791 --> 46:42.375
Hannah Grose.

46:44.666 --> 46:45.583
Step away, Miles.

46:45.666 --> 46:46.750
-He won't.
-He will.

46:47.541 --> 46:48.958
Miles, step away.

46:49.041 --> 46:51.541
Honestly, Hannah,
do you ever get tired of being such--

46:51.625 --> 46:54.333
-Miles.
-I swear, you're such a bore,

46:54.416 --> 46:57.541
-and you don't know when--
-[Miles] To leave well enough alone.

47:00.666 --> 47:02.000
For fuck's sake, woman!

47:03.291 --> 47:05.750
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

47:07.333 --> 47:08.250
-Miles.
-No.

47:08.916 --> 47:10.916
Most of the time, but not right now.

47:12.166 --> 47:13.125
And believe me,

47:13.208 --> 47:15.833
nothing would make me happier

47:15.916 --> 47:18.750
than to be arrested by those police
you were talking about.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.958
To be dragged off this fucking property.

47:22.583 --> 47:25.625
Away from this god-awful trap!

47:27.041 --> 47:29.250
But I can't, can I?

47:30.625 --> 47:31.916
You can't.

47:33.125 --> 47:33.958
Because?

47:35.250 --> 47:36.416
You're dead.

47:37.375 --> 47:38.208
Mm.

47:40.416 --> 47:42.416
And it's such a shame…

47:43.166 --> 47:44.833
that you had to go and follow us.

47:45.333 --> 47:46.708
It was going so well.

47:50.416 --> 47:51.625
Honestly, Hannah!

48:21.125 --> 48:21.958
What?

48:22.458 --> 48:24.958
Mrs.-- Mrs. Grose,
I'm having the strangest dream.

48:26.458 --> 48:28.333
[Flora] Miles! She's here!

48:28.416 --> 48:31.375
She's here, and she's even prettier
than I imagined!

48:33.166 --> 48:34.250
Oh, this is her?

48:35.208 --> 48:37.041
[Dani] Hi, Miles! It's nice to meet you.

48:37.125 --> 48:39.500
-So pleased to meet you, my lady.
-Oh!

48:40.041 --> 48:41.000
[chuckles]

48:41.083 --> 48:42.666
Well, aren't you the gentleman?

48:43.666 --> 48:45.250
And this must be Mrs. Grose.

48:45.791 --> 48:47.083
[chuckles] Hi.

48:47.166 --> 48:48.291
-Oh.
-Dani.

48:50.458 --> 48:51.875
Oh, I'm so sorry, I was, um…

48:52.375 --> 48:54.291
-Goodness, I wa-- I was miles away.
-[Dani laughs]

48:54.375 --> 48:56.041
Yes, sorry, Hannah Grose. It's, uh…

48:56.125 --> 48:58.041
-Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
-You too.

48:58.125 --> 49:01.041
Was the journey okay?
I see you made it in one piece.

49:01.125 --> 49:01.958
Oh… [laughs]

49:02.041 --> 49:03.333
Yeah. Oh, it was perfect.

49:03.416 --> 49:04.833
[Hannah] Oh, that's good.

49:04.916 --> 49:07.916
Yes, uh, wonderful.
That Owen is a fine young man.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.208
-He's a good sort.
-[Dani] Yeah.

49:10.875 --> 49:13.125
-[Dani laughs]
-Right, well, let's find our way inside.

49:13.208 --> 49:14.791
I'm sure Miss Clayton is eager

49:14.875 --> 49:16.208
-to see the house.
-[Dani] Yes.

49:16.291 --> 49:17.666
[Hannah] Right. Well, come along.

49:18.166 --> 49:20.166
-Now, how will I--
-You can call me Dani.

That's what I learned,

49:30.500 --> 49:31.541

49:32.666 --> 49:34.708
That's kind of what dementia is, isn't it?

49:36.666 --> 49:39.041
I suppose I learned a lot in this.
Or maybe not.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.958
But that's the biggest thing.

49:42.791 --> 49:45.250
We can't count on the past.

49:46.833 --> 49:50.958
I mean, we think we have it
trapped in our memories, but…

49:52.125 --> 49:53.333

49:54.250 --> 49:55.666
We could fade at any time.

50:01.500 --> 50:05.041
Say it with me. Hannah Grose in Paris.

50:05.125 --> 50:07.250
What would I do in Paris?

50:07.333 --> 50:08.791
Well, I don't know.

50:09.333 --> 50:12.125
Eat croissants and-and drink good wine.

50:12.208 --> 50:13.333
And live, Hannah.

Yes.

50:28.041 --> 50:29.708
Yes, Owen, I, um…

50:31.458 --> 50:33.041
I will go to Paris with you.

No, no, um…

50:45.166 --> 50:46.833
I know the road. It's fine.
