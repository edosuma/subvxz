.

00:04.038 --> 00:05.039
>> CAITLYN: Disick is in the

00:05.039 --> 00:06.040
house.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.475
>> SCOTT: Hello!

00:07.475 --> 00:08.476
>> CAITLYN: I don't think Scott

00:08.476 --> 00:10.444
and I have ever really "bonded."

00:10.444 --> 00:11.712
>> SCOTT: Come on, girls.

00:11.712 --> 00:12.746
>> JENNY: The purse, can I just

00:12.746 --> 00:13.847
say, it's a slippery slope.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.515
Be careful.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.516
>> SCOTT: I know.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.251
>> CAITLYN: Come on, let's ride!

00:17.251 --> 00:20.321
(revs engine)

00:20.321 --> 00:22.190
>> CHANDI: Back in the day, I

00:22.190 --> 00:23.624
was running around with the

00:23.624 --> 00:25.693
wrong crowd, and I ended up

00:25.693 --> 00:29.230
going to prison.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.331
>> CANDIS: You're cute. I could

00:30.331 --> 00:31.965
totally kiss you.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.467
It's really nice to be able to,

00:33.467 --> 00:34.735
like, have something with

00:34.735 --> 00:36.804
somebody that I like.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.240
What are you thinking?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.212
Being on this trip, it's so

00:44.212 --> 00:45.313
so weird, I can't remember what

00:45.313 --> 00:46.347
day it is.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.648
>> CHANDI: Is it Monday?

00:47.648 --> 00:48.649
>> JENNY: Today is "Mundy"

00:48.649 --> 00:49.317
night.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.318
>> CHANDI: Exactly.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.719
>> CANDIS: Monday? "Mundy"?

00:51.719 --> 00:52.720
>> JENNY: "Mundy" night.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.721
>> CANDIS: "Mundy."

00:53.721 --> 00:54.455
>> JENNY: "Mundy."

00:54.455 --> 00:55.189
>> CHANDI: "Mundy"?

00:55.189 --> 00:56.190
>> JENNY: Do I say other things

00:56.190 --> 00:57.291
with-with an accent?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.292
"Mundy." "Mundy" night.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.293
>> CHANDI: "Mundy." "Mundy."

00:59.293 --> 01:00.494
>> JENNY: Mon-Mon-day. What do

01:00.494 --> 01:01.429
you say?

01:01.429 --> 01:02.130
>> CANDIS: Monday.

01:02.130 --> 01:02.896
>> JENNY: "Mundy."

01:02.896 --> 01:04.232
>> CHANDI: "Mundy." (laughing)

01:04.232 --> 01:06.267
>> JENNY: What?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.401
Wait, you say it.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.402
>> CHANDI: Monday.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.137
>> JENNY: "Mundy."

01:09.137 --> 01:09.737
>> CHANDI: "Mundy." (laughs)

01:09.737 --> 01:11.405
>> CANDIS: Like "Bundy."

01:11.405 --> 01:12.406
She's like, "What?"

01:12.406 --> 01:13.407
>> ELLA: "Toosdy."

01:13.407 --> 01:14.408
>> JENNY: Mon-Monday?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.409
>> CHANDI: Monday.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.410
>> JENNY: Mon-Monday.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.411
>> CHANDI: "Mundy."

01:17.411 --> 01:18.146
>> JENNY: Is that how you say

01:18.146 --> 01:19.147
it, "Mon-day"?

01:19.147 --> 01:20.314
>> CHANDI: "Mundy"?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.982
(laughs)

01:21.982 --> 01:23.384
We got our lives on "Mundy."

01:23.384 --> 01:24.585
(laughter)

01:24.585 --> 01:25.919
>> JENNY: You're killing me.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.888
(laughter)

01:27.888 --> 01:29.290
>> CHANDI: J.B.!

01:29.290 --> 01:30.558
(Candis laughing)

01:30.558 --> 01:31.559
Whew!

01:31.559 --> 01:32.560
>> ELLA: It's "Mundy."

01:32.560 --> 01:33.361
>> CHANDI: Well, actually, it's

01:33.361 --> 01:34.362
Tuesday.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.863
It's Tuesday now.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.065
(laughter)

01:38.065 --> 01:40.033
*

01:52.613 --> 01:54.582
(phone ringing)

01:58.886 --> 02:00.688
>> CAITLYN: There you are!

02:00.688 --> 02:01.922
>> KOURTNEY: How's it going?

02:01.922 --> 02:02.923
>> CAITLYN: It's going,

02:02.923 --> 02:04.558
actually, very well.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.860
I'm on Highway 70 to St. Louis,

02:06.860 --> 02:07.861
Missouri.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.862
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, nice!

02:08.862 --> 02:09.863
>> CAITLYN: And guess who called

02:09.863 --> 02:10.531
me.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.265
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah. Who?

02:11.265 --> 02:12.966
>> CAITLYN: Guess... Scott.

02:12.966 --> 02:13.967
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, really?

02:13.967 --> 02:14.968
>> CAITLYN: He kind of reached

02:14.968 --> 02:15.969
out.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.104
Kind of wanted to talk, hang

02:17.104 --> 02:19.640
out, so he's on his...

02:19.640 --> 02:20.641
"supposably" on his way to St.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.709
Louis.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.943
So, he's gonna meet us there

02:22.943 --> 02:23.944
tomorrow.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.346
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, no way!

02:25.346 --> 02:26.880
>> CAITLYN: So, yeah. So, I just

02:26.880 --> 02:28.216
kind of wanted to check with you

02:28.216 --> 02:29.217
on th...

02:29.217 --> 02:30.218
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, that's fine

02:30.218 --> 02:31.219
with me.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.653
>> CAITLYN: Oh, okay. I hear

02:32.653 --> 02:33.921
he's sober.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.389
Is that what you hear?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.624
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, he's been

02:36.624 --> 02:37.825
sober.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.959
He's been seeing the kids every

02:38.959 --> 02:39.960
day.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.128
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, well, good.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.231
I-I'm glad he's, you know, doing

02:43.231 --> 02:44.498
well.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.734
I have not seen Scott since he

02:46.734 --> 02:48.236
got back from rehab.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.270
You know, he's been through a

02:49.270 --> 02:51.339
lot, so I would love for him to

02:51.339 --> 02:52.606
be around the girls, who have

02:52.606 --> 02:53.741
been through so much in their

02:53.741 --> 02:56.277
life and have come out so well.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.945
So I think he's gonna spend a

02:57.945 --> 03:00.581
day with-with me and the girls.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.682
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, fun!

03:01.682 --> 03:02.783
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Good, good.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.784
All right, then it should be

03:03.784 --> 03:04.785
good.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.786
Love you! Bye!

03:05.786 --> 03:09.257
>> KOURTNEY: Love you! Bye!

03:09.257 --> 03:10.658
>> KATE: Who is Scott?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.626
>> CAITLYN: Scott is my

03:12.626 --> 03:13.927
stepdaughter Kourtney's baby

03:13.927 --> 03:15.563
daddy.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.564
>> KATE: Oh...

03:16.564 --> 03:17.565
>> CAITLYN: They never got

03:17.565 --> 03:18.699
married, but they just had three

03:18.699 --> 03:19.700
kids together.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.302
Wonderful little kids.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.136
Scott is not a bad guy, but he's

03:23.136 --> 03:25.072
got... he's had a huge drinking

03:25.072 --> 03:26.139
problem.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.308
And it's really had a major

03:27.308 --> 03:29.843
impact on his life.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.612
So he's trying to get his life

03:31.612 --> 03:32.980
back together.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.047
You know, he's been through a

03:34.047 --> 03:35.148
lot.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.117
So, uh, anyway, he's gonna meet

03:37.117 --> 03:39.086
us in St. Louis.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.025
Chandi, to get back on a serious

03:45.025 --> 03:46.159
note...

03:46.159 --> 03:47.160
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.161
>> CAITLYN: As you know better

03:48.161 --> 03:50.130
than anybody, we had a bad year.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.500
21 hate crimes towards trans

03:52.500 --> 03:53.501
women.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.736
So many of these women,

03:55.736 --> 03:57.838
especially in the homicide side

03:57.838 --> 03:58.839
of it...

03:58.839 --> 03:59.840
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.575
>> CAITLYN: ...uh, are trans

04:01.575 --> 04:02.676
women of color.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.044
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.479
>> CAITLYN: Why?

04:05.479 --> 04:07.615
>> CHANDI: Well, a lot of them

04:07.615 --> 04:08.949
don't get the love that they

04:08.949 --> 04:10.618
need at home.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.553
It's a lot easier for-for

04:12.553 --> 04:13.787
parents to accept their children

04:13.787 --> 04:15.323
being gay.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.325
Being trans is taking things to

04:17.325 --> 04:18.526
a whole nother level.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.093
That's... a little bit harder

04:20.093 --> 04:21.929
for them to accept.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.332
They choose to, in most cases,

04:24.332 --> 04:25.566
put their children out.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.035
That's why they have to turn to,

04:28.035 --> 04:31.038
um, survival sex and survival

04:31.038 --> 04:34.141
situations in order for them

04:34.141 --> 04:35.809
to be able to navigate

04:35.809 --> 04:37.345
themselves through life.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.346
>> CAITLYN: Do they understand

04:38.346 --> 04:39.447
the dangers of doing it, what

04:39.447 --> 04:40.448
they're doing?

04:40.448 --> 04:41.449
>> CHANDI: They don't care about

04:41.449 --> 04:42.115
the danger.

04:42.115 --> 04:42.783
>> CANDIS: They know the

04:42.783 --> 04:44.084
dangers, but they don't care.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.085
>> CAITLYN: They don't care?

04:45.085 --> 04:45.819
>> CANDIS: They don't care.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.487
>> CHANDI: ...on the street.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.220
>> CANDIS: They need to survive

04:47.220 --> 04:47.888
day to day.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.222
>> CHANDI: They need a-a roof

04:49.222 --> 04:50.458
over their head at night.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.459
They need to know where their

04:51.459 --> 04:52.893
next meal is coming from.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.763
It's all about making money to

04:55.763 --> 04:59.199
survive on the streets.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.868
>> CAITLYN: Why is it so

05:00.868 --> 05:02.770
difficult for trans women of

05:02.770 --> 05:04.672
color to get a job?

05:04.672 --> 05:05.706
>> CHANDI: A lot of times, race

05:05.706 --> 05:07.174
plays a big part of it.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.175
>> CANDIS: It really does.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.176
>> CHANDI: It does.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.177
>> CAITLYN: That's shocking to

05:10.177 --> 05:11.178
me.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.446
>> CHANDI: That's how it's been.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.514
>> CAITLYN: I-I... No.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.449
O-Obviously. I-I've never seen

05:15.449 --> 05:16.684
it, so... but I... obviously,

05:16.684 --> 05:17.685
you lived through this.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.686
But I-I...

05:18.686 --> 05:19.853
>> CHANDI: I do feel like Cait

05:19.853 --> 05:22.390
needs to embrace the issues that

05:22.390 --> 05:24.758
African-American trans women go

05:24.758 --> 05:27.495
through a little more, but it's

05:27.495 --> 05:28.562
still a journey that she'll

05:28.562 --> 05:31.399
never relate to in any way.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.774
>> CANDIS: Oh, the Arch!

05:40.774 --> 05:42.175
The St. Louis Arch.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.176
>> CAITLYN: The Arch of St.

05:43.176 --> 05:43.844
Louis!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.012
>> ELLA: Oh, my golly!

05:45.012 --> 05:46.013
>> CAITLYN: There it is, right

05:46.013 --> 05:47.014
over there. See it?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.015
>> KIP: Oh, wow, look at it!

05:48.015 --> 05:50.418
>> ELLA: Oh, yeah!

05:50.418 --> 05:54.154
*

05:54.154 --> 05:56.624
>> KATE: Oh, golly, we're here.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.762
>> ELLA: We made it!

06:01.762 --> 06:03.997
>> KATE: Good evening to you.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.137
(birds chirping)

06:12.172 --> 06:15.676
(treadmill whirring)

06:15.676 --> 06:16.677
>> ANDREW: I told you I was

06:16.677 --> 06:17.678
gonna push you, didn't I?

06:17.678 --> 06:18.345
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.947
>> ANDREW: Yeah.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.114
See, now you started out liking

06:21.114 --> 06:22.783
me, loving me, and now you just

06:22.783 --> 06:24.317
kind of like, uh, uh... now it's

06:24.317 --> 06:25.719
got a love/hate relationship.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.754
>> CANDIS: So I've been feeling

06:26.754 --> 06:28.989
a little blah lately because I

06:28.989 --> 06:30.458
haven't been working out.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.759
So I found a trainer, and he's

06:31.759 --> 06:33.961
super cute so I'm excited about

06:33.961 --> 06:34.962
our workout.

06:34.962 --> 06:35.963
>> ANDREW: Good job. Take a

06:35.963 --> 06:37.197
break, minute break.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.799
Here you go.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.800
So what do you have planned for

06:39.800 --> 06:40.801
the rest of the day?

06:40.801 --> 06:42.536
>> CANDIS: Maybe walk down here

06:42.536 --> 06:44.237
and see the sights or something?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.238
>> ANDREW: Perfect.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.640
>> CANDIS: If you're bored, you

06:46.640 --> 06:47.675
could join me.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.676
>> ANDREW: Okay, yeah.

06:48.676 --> 06:49.677
Take a little walk.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.343
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.012
I'm not somebody who usually

06:52.012 --> 06:54.181
asks somebody out, so I kind of

06:54.181 --> 06:56.083
was like, "Let's just kind of

06:56.083 --> 06:58.819
take a chance and... see what

06:58.819 --> 06:59.820
happens."

06:59.820 --> 07:00.688
>> ANDREW: I'll see you at the

07:00.688 --> 07:01.354
lobby.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.323
All right. Bye.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.395
I'll have a cappuccino.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.396
>> CANDIS: You're gonna make me

07:09.396 --> 07:10.598
eat alone?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.165
>> ANDREW: Okay. I'll eat.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.200
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.503
(Andrew chuckles)

07:15.503 --> 07:16.504
>> ANDREW: Um...

07:16.504 --> 07:17.505
>> CANDIS: See? I get my way.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.506
>> ANDREW: You do, you do, you

07:18.506 --> 07:19.507
do.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.508
>> CANDIS: It's just so cute,

07:20.508 --> 07:21.742
this little alley there, with,

07:21.742 --> 07:23.143
like, the restaurants and...

07:23.143 --> 07:24.144
>> ANDREW: So, question.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.779
'Cause I'm curious.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.780
And, of course, you can stop me

07:26.780 --> 07:28.348
if you want.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.550
Um, you've dated other guys,

07:29.550 --> 07:30.784
right, in the past?

07:30.784 --> 07:31.785
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.786
>> ANDREW: Like, 'cause you've

07:32.786 --> 07:33.787
totally been open with them.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.188
Like, "This is who I am and..."

07:35.188 --> 07:36.189
>> CANDIS: This is who I am.

07:36.189 --> 07:36.857
>> ANDREW: Right.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.991
>> CANDIS: For me, personally,

07:37.991 --> 07:39.560
I'm always open about my

07:39.560 --> 07:40.761
transition when I'm dating

07:40.761 --> 07:41.795
somebody.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.796
>> ANDREW: How-how have they

07:42.796 --> 07:43.531
taken that?

07:43.531 --> 07:44.532
>> CANDIS: Well, the guys that

07:44.532 --> 07:46.199
I've dated, obviously, are fine

07:46.199 --> 07:47.701
with it, you know?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.069
I guess it depends on the guy

07:49.069 --> 07:50.370
and how comfortable they are

07:50.370 --> 07:51.739
with their own masculinity.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.173
And this is the longest I've

07:53.173 --> 07:54.908
been without a relationship, and

07:54.908 --> 07:57.077
it's been nice to finally date

07:57.077 --> 07:58.546
myself for a while.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.947
You know what I mean?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.314
And I think I've discovered what

08:01.314 --> 08:02.683
I like and...

08:02.683 --> 08:03.350
>> ANDREW: What do you like?

08:03.350 --> 08:04.017
>> CANDIS: Tall, dark, and

08:04.017 --> 08:04.685
handsome.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.352
>> ANDREW: Tall, dar... Oh,

08:05.352 --> 08:06.019
really?

08:06.019 --> 08:06.687
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.354
>> ANDREW: Interesting.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.088
I think it might be just around

08:08.088 --> 08:08.756
the corner.

08:08.756 --> 08:09.757
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.358
Andrew is kind of surprising me,

08:11.358 --> 08:12.926
because we're actually really

08:12.926 --> 08:14.795
connecting and I'm attracted to

08:14.795 --> 08:16.263
him and he seems like he's

08:16.263 --> 08:18.566
flirting back.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.467
So that's kind of cool.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.468
>> ANDREW: There anything you

08:21.468 --> 08:23.671
would want to know about me?

08:23.671 --> 08:24.672
>> CANDIS: How did you get that

08:24.672 --> 08:26.273
perfect skin and that gorgeous

08:26.273 --> 08:27.274
body?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.008
>> ANDREW: Well, I was born this

08:28.008 --> 08:30.678
way, and so thank my parents.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.646
(both laugh)

08:35.182 --> 08:38.485
(birds chirping)

08:38.485 --> 08:39.587
(doorbell rings)

08:39.587 --> 08:40.588
(door opens)

08:40.588 --> 08:41.221
>> CAITLYN: Hey, babe.

08:41.221 --> 08:41.889
>> CHANDI: Look at you!

08:41.889 --> 08:42.690
>> CAITLYN: Look at you. Look at

08:42.690 --> 08:43.356
you!

08:43.356 --> 08:44.224
My God, girl.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.225
>> CHANDI: Well, you know?

08:45.225 --> 08:45.893
>> CAITLYN: This time in the

08:45.893 --> 08:46.894
morning, and you're just all

08:46.894 --> 08:48.228
dressed up, ready to go.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.462
Let's take this day on.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.463
>> CHANDI: I think I felt a

08:50.463 --> 08:53.000
little... unresolved, like there

08:53.000 --> 08:54.167
was something that I needed to

08:54.167 --> 08:56.604
say to Cait so that she can

08:56.604 --> 08:58.305
identify better with where

08:58.305 --> 09:00.908
African-American trans women

09:00.908 --> 09:02.610
come from.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.611
>> CAITLYN: I hear Mama's coming

09:03.611 --> 09:04.778
to St. Louis.

09:04.778 --> 09:05.779
>> CHANDI: She adores you.

09:05.779 --> 09:06.780
>> CAITLYN: Mmm, I know.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.016
(both laugh)

09:09.016 --> 09:10.017
Anyway, you said you wanted to

09:10.017 --> 09:11.018
talk.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.019
>> CHANDI: Yeah, I wanted to

09:12.019 --> 09:13.020
talk to you because I wanted to

09:13.020 --> 09:14.354
tell you a little bit about my

09:14.354 --> 09:16.657
past.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.226
Back in the day, before I got

09:19.226 --> 09:21.895
into doing all of this work that

09:21.895 --> 09:24.197
I've been doing, I was running

09:24.197 --> 09:29.069
around with the wrong crowd.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.872
Because I was going through

09:31.872 --> 09:34.274
trying to figure out who I am

09:34.274 --> 09:36.543
and I didn't necessarily want to

09:36.543 --> 09:38.679
deal with explaining it to my

09:38.679 --> 09:41.481
family, so I wanted to try to

09:41.481 --> 09:42.650
see if I could figure it out on

09:42.650 --> 09:44.417
my own.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.553
I got into some heavy stuff, you

09:46.553 --> 09:48.922
know, doing some white-collar

09:48.922 --> 09:51.458
crimes and writing checks and

09:51.458 --> 09:53.293
doing credit cards and stuff

09:53.293 --> 09:55.295
like that, and I ended up going

09:55.295 --> 09:57.264
to prison.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.203
>> CAITLYN: Disick is in the

10:03.203 --> 10:04.204
house.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.205
>> SCOTT: Hello! Look at this!

10:05.205 --> 10:06.206
>> CAITLYN: This is

10:06.206 --> 10:07.207
unbelievable.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.742
I don't think Scott and I have

10:08.742 --> 10:10.510
ever really "bonded."

10:10.510 --> 10:11.845
(motorcycles rumbling)

10:11.845 --> 10:13.814
Come on, let's ride!

10:18.652 --> 10:19.887
>> CHANDI: I ended up going to

10:19.887 --> 10:22.189
prison.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.758
I was scared to death.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.927
I was scared to death.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.029
And, um, at that time, like,

10:29.029 --> 10:31.531
maybe ten of us who were openly

10:31.531 --> 10:34.234
homosexual-- as that's... 'cause

10:34.234 --> 10:36.136
that's what they called us-- um,

10:36.136 --> 10:41.408
up against maybe 1,500 men.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.443
>> CAITLYN: For me, I-I can't

10:43.443 --> 10:44.778
see little Chandi, you know, in

10:44.778 --> 10:46.146
jail.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.414
I can't even visualize that,

10:47.414 --> 10:48.849
'cause she's such a good person.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.850
What were you using that money

10:49.850 --> 10:51.518
for, just...

10:51.518 --> 10:54.021
>> CHANDI: Survival. Um, food,

10:54.021 --> 10:56.724
hormones, a place to stay.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.926
'Cause none of us had jobs.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.794
We were all living from day to

11:00.794 --> 11:02.062
day.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.230
You know, it wasn't a easy road

11:03.230 --> 11:04.597
getting here.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.999
I wish someone would've told me

11:05.999 --> 11:07.835
back then that if I became a

11:07.835 --> 11:09.569
felon that I wouldn't be able

11:09.569 --> 11:11.739
to work at a bank or how it

11:11.739 --> 11:13.573
would be a problem for me to get

11:13.573 --> 11:14.742
a passport.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.977
That was me back in that day

11:16.977 --> 11:19.212
before I became who I am.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.647
>> CAITLYN: Your parents were

11:20.647 --> 11:22.015
not there for you.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.250
>> CHANDI: They weren't there

11:23.250 --> 11:24.918
only because I didn't want to

11:24.918 --> 11:26.319
tell them.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.554
>> CAITLYN: About being trans?

11:27.554 --> 11:28.555
>> CHANDI: About being trans.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.589
I just didn't know how they

11:29.589 --> 11:30.891
would accept that.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.525
Me and my mom struggled through

11:32.525 --> 11:36.296
my transition because we... just

11:36.296 --> 11:40.467
didn't know how we would come

11:40.467 --> 11:42.770
together on the fact that I was

11:42.770 --> 11:45.873
changing from who she bore as a

11:45.873 --> 11:46.874
child.

11:46.874 --> 11:47.875
>> CAITLYN: Did you have anybody

11:47.875 --> 11:49.409
to confide in, at that point?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.410
>> CHANDI: Well, my friends that

11:50.410 --> 11:51.879
I was running around with at

11:51.879 --> 11:54.447
that time, um, we all, you know,

11:54.447 --> 11:55.615
talked about it, because there

11:55.615 --> 11:57.217
was a couple of us who were

11:57.217 --> 11:58.518
going through the same thing.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.788
We were just living it from day

12:00.788 --> 12:02.522
to day, performing in the clubs,

12:02.522 --> 12:04.825
trying to make tips, and, um,

12:04.825 --> 12:06.226
trying to support ourselves in

12:06.226 --> 12:07.227
those ways.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.363
And so that was fast money.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.099
For us. Back then.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.166
But fast money doesn't last

12:13.166 --> 12:14.167
long.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.969
>> CAITLYN: No, it doesn't.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.105
It's so interesting to me to see

12:18.105 --> 12:19.339
what she's been through in her

12:19.339 --> 12:22.075
life and so many trans women go

12:22.075 --> 12:23.510
through and that is survival

12:23.510 --> 12:25.145
crimes.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.579
She was trying to survive and

12:26.579 --> 12:27.647
didn't know any other way to do

12:27.647 --> 12:28.648
it.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.950
And to hear that from somebody

12:29.950 --> 12:32.352
that you love and adore, I

12:32.352 --> 12:33.821
think, for me, it helps

12:33.821 --> 12:36.456
understand the issues better.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.460
(horn blowing)

12:49.837 --> 12:51.571
Scott Disick.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.240
I don't think Scott and I have

12:53.240 --> 12:54.908
ever really "bonded," in the

12:54.908 --> 12:57.077
sense that... I think we're just

12:57.077 --> 12:58.511
different people.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.213
(doorbell rings)

13:00.213 --> 13:01.481
Disick is in the house.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.416
>> SCOTT: Hello!

13:03.416 --> 13:04.417
>> CAITLYN: How the hell are you

13:04.417 --> 13:05.452
doing?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.453
>> SCOTT: How you doin'?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.487
>> CAITLYN: Can't believe the

13:07.487 --> 13:09.056
family member here.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.690
This is unbelievable. Yeah!

13:10.690 --> 13:12.025
>> SCOTT: Good livin'.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.060
>> CAITLYN: Have a seat.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.061
>> SCOTT: Nice boots!

13:14.061 --> 13:15.062
>> CAITLYN: Well, thank you,

13:15.062 --> 13:16.063
thank you.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.764
>> SCOTT: What's going on?

13:17.764 --> 13:19.466
>> CAITLYN: Well, just hanging

13:19.466 --> 13:20.467
out with the girls.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.468
>> SCOTT: How's it being in a

13:21.468 --> 13:22.135
bus?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.136
>> CAITLYN: A lot of very

13:23.136 --> 13:24.471
interesting conversations.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.472
>> SCOTT: I'm sure.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.473
>> CAITLYN: Transitioning,

13:26.473 --> 13:27.674
dealing with gender-- all of

13:27.674 --> 13:28.675
that.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.411
And, um, I-I think, for you,

13:31.411 --> 13:32.980
being around all these girls

13:32.980 --> 13:34.547
with their stories and their

13:34.547 --> 13:35.715
stuff, I think can only be very

13:35.715 --> 13:36.716
positive for you.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.584
>> SCOTT: Yeah, well, that's

13:37.584 --> 13:38.251
what I was thinking.

13:38.251 --> 13:38.919
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.053
These girls have overcome so

13:40.053 --> 13:41.889
many obstacles in their life

13:41.889 --> 13:43.556
that hopefully it'll be

13:43.556 --> 13:45.658
inspiring for him to be around

13:45.658 --> 13:47.460
this really great group of

13:47.460 --> 13:48.461
people.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.462
>> CANDIS: Hi.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.130
>> SCOTT: Hi. Scott.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.131
>> CAITLYN: Oh, you haven't met!

13:51.131 --> 13:52.065
>> SCOTT: Hi. How are you?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.066
>> CANDIS: Nice to meet you.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.067
>> SCOTT: Nice to meet you.

13:54.067 --> 13:54.734
How you doin'?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.136
>> CANDIS: I'm good.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.404
>> ELLA: Hello, ladies!

13:57.404 --> 13:58.705
>> CHANDI: How's it going?

13:58.705 --> 14:00.107
Hey, Lord Disick, I do hugs.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.174
I do hugs.

14:01.174 --> 14:01.909
>> SCOTT: There you go.

14:01.909 --> 14:02.575
>> CHANDI: How you doin'?

14:02.575 --> 14:03.243
>> SCOTT: Not bad.

14:03.243 --> 14:03.911
>> CHANDI: Great.

14:03.911 --> 14:04.577
>> JENNY: Scott, Jenny.

14:04.577 --> 14:05.245
How are you?

14:05.245 --> 14:05.913
>> CAITLYN: Jenny Boylan.

14:05.913 --> 14:06.579
>> JENNY: Pleasure.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.981
I feel like I know you, but...

14:07.981 --> 14:08.982
>> SCOTT: Well, you're gonna get

14:08.982 --> 14:09.649
to.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.650
(laughter)

14:10.650 --> 14:11.318
>> CAITLYN: Let's go.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.319
>> SCOTT: Are we riding there?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.320
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, we got to bus

14:13.320 --> 14:13.987
out there.

14:13.987 --> 14:14.721
>> SCOTT: Come on, girls.

14:14.721 --> 14:15.722
>> JENNY: Disick, it's a

14:15.722 --> 14:16.389
slippery slope.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.124
>> CAITLYN: I used to give him a

14:17.124 --> 14:17.925
hard time about his purse...

14:17.925 --> 14:18.525
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.392
>> JENNY: The purse, can I just

14:19.392 --> 14:20.393
say, it's a slippery slope.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.394
Be careful.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.462
>> SCOTT: I know.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.931
A few more days here, God knows.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.098
(Kate chuckles)

14:25.098 --> 14:27.968
(birds chirping)

14:27.968 --> 14:29.736
>> ELLA: Okay, let's go.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.538
>> CAITLYN: Let's check it out.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.539
>> CHANDI: Now, Scott, don't get

14:32.539 --> 14:34.041
quiet on us, 'cause we know

14:34.041 --> 14:35.042
you're not shy.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.310
>> SCOTT: Okay.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.012
(Van shouts)

14:39.012 --> 14:40.013
>> CAITLYN: God!

14:40.013 --> 14:41.048
>> VAN: Caitlyn!

14:41.048 --> 14:43.083
>> CAITLYN: We came to you!

14:43.083 --> 14:44.351
We came to you!

14:44.351 --> 14:46.086
Aren't you so happy? We're here.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.087
>> VAN: Oh, my God, I so wasn't

14:47.087 --> 14:48.088
ready for that.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.089
>> CAITLYN: You weren't ready

14:49.089 --> 14:49.822
for that.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.024
>> VAN: Oh, my God. Everyone,

14:51.024 --> 14:52.059
this is my husband Rick.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.060
>> CAITLYN: Hello, Rick.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.427
>> RICK: Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.963
>> VAN: Welcome to St. Louis.

14:55.963 --> 14:56.964
>> CAITLYN: It's been quite a

14:56.964 --> 14:57.965
long journey to get here, but

14:57.965 --> 14:59.299
we're here.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.402
So excited to see Van Barnes.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.171
She's a friend of all of us.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.139
Uh, uh, very close to Zackary.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.240
She works on Transparent with

15:07.240 --> 15:08.341
her.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.443
And she's happily married to a

15:10.443 --> 15:12.645
cisgender-- which means not

15:12.645 --> 15:16.183
transgender-- male, big daddy.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.184
>> SCOTT: This pool table is,

15:17.184 --> 15:17.850
like, for a child.

15:17.850 --> 15:18.651
>> COURTNEY: Just focus.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.652
>> SCOTT: There you go.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.521
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, I had the

15:21.521 --> 15:23.356
best time with the trainer

15:23.356 --> 15:24.357
that's, like...

15:24.357 --> 15:25.025
>> VAN: You got a trainer in

15:25.025 --> 15:25.692
St. Louis?

15:25.692 --> 15:26.493
>> CANDIS: Yeah, well, he's...

15:26.493 --> 15:27.360
>> VAN: You're such a liar.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.228
Okay, start the story over.

15:28.228 --> 15:28.895
>> CANDIS: No, so we have...

15:28.895 --> 15:30.163
>> CHANDI: Uh, oh!

15:30.163 --> 15:31.231
You want to see him?

15:31.231 --> 15:32.232
>> VAN: I thought there were...

15:32.232 --> 15:33.233
Is he one of the bodyguards?

15:33.233 --> 15:34.001
>> CHANDI: That's her new

15:34.001 --> 15:34.634
husband.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.502
>> VAN: Oh, right, honey.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.169
>> CHANDI: Uh-huh.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.170
>> VAN: And does Cait know

15:37.170 --> 15:37.837
you're cheating on her?

15:37.837 --> 15:38.505
>> CANDIS: Shh...

15:38.505 --> 15:39.506
>> CHANDI: No.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.008
>> WOMAN: Say cheese!

15:41.008 --> 15:42.009
>> CANDIS: Scott.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.010
>> SCOTT: Yes.

15:43.010 --> 15:43.876
>> CANDIS: Come join us!

15:43.876 --> 15:44.611
>> SCOTT: All right, what did I

15:44.611 --> 15:45.278
miss?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.414
>> VAN: We need you to, um, kind

15:47.414 --> 15:49.016
of mediate this whole piece on

15:49.016 --> 15:50.617
the side issue that Candis has

15:50.617 --> 15:51.651
right now.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.885
>> CANDIS: No, uh, we were just

15:52.885 --> 15:54.787
talking about wanting you to be

15:54.787 --> 15:56.256
in our group.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.257
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.258
>> CANDIS: You're an honorary

15:58.258 --> 15:59.059
trans woman.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.060
>> SCOTT: I been here ten

16:00.060 --> 16:00.860
minutes.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.595
>> VAN: If you did, we might

16:02.595 --> 16:03.796
even let you join our club.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.199
>> SCOTT: Stop! Well, now, when

16:06.199 --> 16:07.567
you say that, I'd be open to

16:07.567 --> 16:08.568
changing around town.

16:08.568 --> 16:09.569
>> VAN: You would be in training

16:09.569 --> 16:10.237
though for, like, a little

16:10.237 --> 16:10.903
while.

16:10.903 --> 16:11.904
>> SCOTT: Well, of course.

16:11.904 --> 16:12.905
It's gonna be a long journey.

16:12.905 --> 16:13.906
>> CANDIS: (laughs) It is.

16:13.906 --> 16:14.907
>> CHANDI: He's trying to wrap

16:14.907 --> 16:15.908
his head around being around all

16:15.908 --> 16:17.244
these girls.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.311
>> SCOTT: I'm used to being

16:18.311 --> 16:19.779
around a lot of women.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.049
I'm just not used to being asked

16:22.049 --> 16:23.616
to become one.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.618
(laughter)

16:25.618 --> 16:26.619
>> CAITLYN: All right. Come on,

16:26.619 --> 16:27.887
let's ride!

16:27.887 --> 16:29.556
(motorcycle rumbling)

16:29.556 --> 16:31.691
This is not my first rodeo.

16:31.691 --> 16:32.859
>> VAN: I bet it isn't.

16:32.859 --> 16:33.860
(Caitlyn laughs)

16:33.860 --> 16:34.861
>> CANDIS: I'm riding behind

16:34.861 --> 16:35.862
your man.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.064
>> VAN: Go easy on him.

16:37.064 --> 16:40.133
(Candis laughs)

16:40.133 --> 16:41.468
(whoops)

16:41.468 --> 16:43.436
(motorcycles rumbling)

16:49.909 --> 16:51.078
*

16:51.078 --> 16:52.379
>> CANDIS: I'm gonna go grab a

16:52.379 --> 16:53.646
drink with Andrew.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.647
>> CAITLYN: Don't do anything I

16:54.647 --> 16:56.249
wouldn't do.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.250
>> CANDIS: You have ten

16:57.250 --> 16:58.418
children.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.287
(both laugh)

17:00.287 --> 17:01.354
>> SCOTT: I haven't talked to

17:01.354 --> 17:02.355
you all night.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.090
>> COURTNEY: Are you ignoring

17:03.090 --> 17:03.756
him?

17:03.756 --> 17:04.557
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not ignoring

17:04.557 --> 17:05.225
him.

17:05.225 --> 17:05.958
He's over there!

17:05.958 --> 17:06.959
>> SCOTT: I'm not that far.

17:06.959 --> 17:07.960
>> CAITLYN: But, for me, with my

17:07.960 --> 17:08.628
ears...

17:08.628 --> 17:09.629
>> SCOTT: Is it really your

17:09.629 --> 17:10.697
ears, or you just don't want to

17:10.697 --> 17:12.665
listen?

17:14.101 --> 17:15.102
>> CAITLYN: All right. Let's

17:15.102 --> 17:16.236
ride!

17:16.236 --> 17:18.205
(motorcycles rumbling)

17:25.412 --> 17:26.413
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.414
>> RICK: You leaned over too

17:27.414 --> 17:28.415
much on me.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.116
>> CANDIS: I did?

17:29.116 --> 17:30.117
>> RICK: Yeah. You okay?

17:30.117 --> 17:31.118
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.719
I don't know what happened.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.221
>> VAN: You got road rash, girl?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.455
>> CANDIS: I got road rash.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.158
I did not lean on that

17:38.158 --> 17:40.026
motorcycle.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.861
It was not my fault.

17:41.861 --> 17:42.862
>> VAN: Look at Miss Cait.

17:42.862 --> 17:43.596
>> COURTNEY: Do you want to get

17:43.596 --> 17:44.297
back on, or no?

17:44.297 --> 17:45.132
You don't have to, you don't

17:45.132 --> 17:45.732
have to.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.533
>> VAN: Here, I'll take your

17:46.533 --> 17:47.033
spot.

17:47.033 --> 17:47.900
>> CANDIS: I think you should

17:47.900 --> 17:49.936
go, yeah you're used to it.

17:49.936 --> 17:50.937
>> COURTNEY: What's happening?

17:50.937 --> 17:51.938
>> CANDIS: I knew I shouldn't

17:51.938 --> 17:53.206
have gotten onto his (bleep)

17:53.206 --> 17:55.808
motorcycle, no!

17:55.808 --> 17:56.809
>> ELLA: Candis, are you okay?

17:56.809 --> 17:57.577
>> JENNY: Sweetie, what

17:57.577 --> 17:58.178
happened?

17:58.178 --> 17:58.911
>> CANDIS: I'm okay.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.912
>> ELLA: I just heard the news.

17:59.912 --> 18:00.780
>> JENNY: Do you need a Band-Aid

18:00.780 --> 18:01.381
or something?

18:01.381 --> 18:02.382
>> CANDIS: No, I'm okay.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.183
I need a drink.

18:03.183 --> 18:03.683
>> JENNY: Okay.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.017
We need a drink for this injured

18:05.017 --> 18:06.018
motorcycle rider.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.154
(Candis laughs)

18:07.154 --> 18:10.390
*

18:10.390 --> 18:12.359
>> VAN: Lead the way, girl.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.301
(whoops)

18:21.301 --> 18:23.270
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

18:25.938 --> 18:27.940
>> SCOTT: What is tomorrow,

18:27.940 --> 18:28.575
exactly?

18:28.575 --> 18:29.576
>> ZACKARY: It's the Transday

18:29.576 --> 18:31.178
Remembrance, so, you know,

18:31.178 --> 18:32.945
trans people are murdered, at-at

18:32.945 --> 18:34.914
an alarming rate in some way...

18:34.914 --> 18:36.183
>> SCOTT: Really?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.250
>> ZACKARY: So, the Transday

18:37.250 --> 18:39.452
Remembrance sort of celebrates

18:39.452 --> 18:41.521
the lives that have been lost

18:41.521 --> 18:43.690
over the past year.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.857
It's been happening for 16

18:44.857 --> 18:45.925
years.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.194
Even the numbers that we have

18:47.194 --> 18:48.528
are not necessarily accurate

18:48.528 --> 18:50.062
because so much of it is not

18:50.062 --> 18:52.965
reported, or people are

18:52.965 --> 18:56.269
misgendered in the news.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.806
It's tough.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.375
Here they come.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.643
>> SCOTT: Oh, yeah.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.012
Hell's Angels.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.980
>> CAITLYN: Hey, there.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.420
>> VAN: You're an old pro, girl.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.421
>> CAITLYN: Oh, thank you.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.222
That was fun.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.022
>> RICK: It was fun.

19:16.022 --> 19:16.723
>> VAN: All right.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.424
>> CAITLYN: I know.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.126
>> RICK: Most of it was.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.127
>> CAITLYN: What age were you

19:21.127 --> 19:22.128
when you transitioned?

19:22.128 --> 19:23.463
>> VAN: I transitioned twice,

19:23.463 --> 19:24.464
actually.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.832
The first time around, I just

19:25.832 --> 19:26.999
found it so hard to find gainful

19:26.999 --> 19:28.868
employment that I, uh,

19:28.868 --> 19:31.738
regressed, and went back to, uh,

19:31.738 --> 19:33.240
presenting male in order to make

19:33.240 --> 19:34.241
a, uh...

19:34.241 --> 19:35.242
>> CAITLYN: Pay the bills.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.509
>> VAN: Yeah, basically.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.077
Pay the bills honestly.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.379
But it's hard to have to do

19:39.379 --> 19:40.713
that twice.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.349
After the first time, I actually

19:42.349 --> 19:44.251
had, uh, liposuction on my

19:44.251 --> 19:46.853
torso, on my breasts, because

19:46.853 --> 19:47.854
I'd grown them naturally.

19:47.854 --> 19:48.855
>> CAITLYN: I had the exact same

19:48.855 --> 19:49.856
thing.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.557
>> VAN: Oh, really, when you

19:50.557 --> 19:51.558
were in hiding?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.560
>> CAITLYN: '80s, uh, I was on

19:53.560 --> 19:54.561
hormones for four and a half

19:54.561 --> 19:55.094
years.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.095
>> SCOTT: Oh, by the way, you

19:56.095 --> 19:57.096
know...

19:57.096 --> 19:58.097
>> CAITLYN: Because I just don't

19:58.097 --> 19:59.266
even have any more secrets.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.132
I'm a lot happier.

20:00.132 --> 20:00.967
>> VAN: No, honey.

20:00.967 --> 20:01.634
>> ELLA: None?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.469
>> CAITLYN: What else can I

20:02.469 --> 20:03.336
tell?

20:03.336 --> 20:03.836
>> ELLA: None?

20:03.836 --> 20:04.837
>> CAITLYN: So, when it was

20:04.837 --> 20:06.105
Kim's birthday, and Kendall and

20:06.105 --> 20:06.606
Kylie...

20:06.606 --> 20:07.607
>> SCOTT: Cait... Caitlyn, you

20:07.607 --> 20:08.107
know what?

20:08.107 --> 20:09.108
>> CAITLYN: ...really nice

20:09.108 --> 20:10.277
gifts.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.278
>> SCOTT: Caitlyn?

20:11.278 --> 20:12.279
>> CAITLYN: I figured they'd

20:12.279 --> 20:13.413
feel guilty, they wouldn't mind

20:13.413 --> 20:14.881
spending it, you know, on me.

20:14.881 --> 20:15.882
>> SCOTT: Caitlyn.

20:15.882 --> 20:16.683
>> CAITLYN: This year, for my

20:16.683 --> 20:18.785
birthday, I told these girls,

20:18.785 --> 20:20.820
"If I get one more goddamn golf

20:20.820 --> 20:22.555
shirt, you're dead."

20:22.555 --> 20:23.556
>> SCOTT: She gets to talk and

20:23.556 --> 20:24.557
she gets to talk.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.425
>> JENNY: Yeah, right, also...

20:25.425 --> 20:26.426
>> SCOTT: That hasn't changed.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.260
>> JENNY: I think she can't, she

20:27.260 --> 20:28.261
can't always hear.

20:28.261 --> 20:28.995
>> SCOTT: Yeah, it's true.

20:28.995 --> 20:29.996
>> JENNY: Just a little.

20:29.996 --> 20:30.697
>> SCOTT: Especially with the

20:30.697 --> 20:31.698
hair.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.699
Just saying.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.700
>> JENNY: You said you had some

20:33.700 --> 20:35.768
questions about family stuff.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.769
>> SCOTT: Well, yeah, I just

20:36.769 --> 20:37.437
kind of...

20:37.437 --> 20:38.938
I mean, I feel like Caitlyn has

20:38.938 --> 20:40.573
been so busy running around and

20:40.573 --> 20:41.841
traveling and, you know,

20:41.841 --> 20:42.842
bringing awareness...

20:42.842 --> 20:43.376
>> JENNY: Mm-hmm.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.377
>> SCOTT: ...that, you know, my

20:44.377 --> 20:45.978
kids don't really know exactly

20:45.978 --> 20:48.581
what's gone on, I don't know if

20:48.581 --> 20:49.582
they're old enough.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.817
You know, my daughter has met

20:50.817 --> 20:54.086
her and was totally okay, didn't

20:54.086 --> 20:55.888
really, I don't think, grasp

20:55.888 --> 20:58.325
exactly that... that was

20:58.325 --> 21:00.293
grandpa, now it's grandma.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.094
My son was a little nervous.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.095
>> JENNY: They get the message

21:03.095 --> 21:04.096
you send them.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.732
So, if you talk about it with

21:05.732 --> 21:07.334
them like you're on tenterhooks

21:07.334 --> 21:08.335
and you're all jumpy, they'll

21:08.335 --> 21:09.336
get that.

21:09.336 --> 21:09.969
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.003
>> JENNY: I sat down with my

21:11.003 --> 21:12.872
children and said, "You've

21:12.872 --> 21:14.341
probably noticed that I've been

21:14.341 --> 21:15.342
looking more and more like a

21:15.342 --> 21:17.910
girl recently, and I have this

21:17.910 --> 21:20.347
condition where my insides don't

21:20.347 --> 21:21.714
match my outsides."

21:21.714 --> 21:23.249
"Um, I know that might be weird

21:23.249 --> 21:25.051
for you, but you know I'm always

21:25.051 --> 21:26.152
gonna love you."

21:26.152 --> 21:27.354
And I think my son said

21:27.354 --> 21:28.921
something like, "Well, if you're

21:28.921 --> 21:30.122
always gonna love me, it won't

21:30.122 --> 21:31.123
be weird."

21:31.123 --> 21:32.392
In my experience, it seems like

21:32.392 --> 21:33.693
a bigger deal, I think, to

21:33.693 --> 21:35.662
grown-ups than it is to kids.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.078
>> CAITLYN: Oh, is that

21:52.078 --> 21:53.279
adorable?

21:53.279 --> 21:55.047
We've spent so much time in that

21:55.047 --> 21:57.684
bus in very close quarters that

21:57.684 --> 21:58.818
it did get a little heated,

21:58.818 --> 22:00.019
that it's time to kind of, like,

22:00.019 --> 22:01.788
just take a break, uh, get on a

22:01.788 --> 22:04.023
riverboat cruise where we can

22:04.023 --> 22:05.858
see the city, the Arch,

22:05.858 --> 22:06.859
everything.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.561
It should be fun.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.062
>> COURTNEY: Ooh, it's chilly.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.464
Ugh.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.699
>> VAN: If we had to like, jump

22:12.699 --> 22:13.700
out right now and swim, could

22:13.700 --> 22:14.266
you do it?

22:14.266 --> 22:15.267
>> ZACKARY: Yeah.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.268
>> VAN: Yeah, me too.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.237
(horn blows)

22:21.441 --> 22:23.443
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.677
I think they... they did that on

22:24.677 --> 22:25.678
purpose.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.679
>> ZACKARY: I think I got to

22:26.679 --> 22:28.815
change my panties.

22:28.815 --> 22:32.284
>> CANDIS: Jesus Christ.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.486
>> CAITLYN: It's too cold here,

22:33.486 --> 22:34.921
let's go inside.

22:34.921 --> 22:35.922
I'm freezing.

22:35.922 --> 22:36.923
>> JENNY: All right, let's get

22:36.923 --> 22:37.590
in.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.591
>> CHANDI: You know, there's a

22:38.591 --> 22:39.959
new term now, maybe you've heard

22:39.959 --> 22:40.993
it: pansexual.

22:40.993 --> 22:41.561
>> ELLA: Pansexual.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.562
>> SCOTT: What the hell is that?

22:42.562 --> 22:44.263
>> CHANDI: Okay, pansexual means

22:44.263 --> 22:46.666
that you're open to all genders.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.734
That you're just...

22:47.734 --> 22:48.735
>> SCOTT: Oh, just testing

22:48.735 --> 22:49.736
waters.

22:49.736 --> 22:50.770
>> CHANDI: Just testing waters,

22:50.770 --> 22:51.771
trying whatever.

22:51.771 --> 22:52.772
>> SCOTT: Now, one other

22:52.772 --> 22:54.106
question, is that a talked-about

22:54.106 --> 22:56.042
thing-- who's gone full circle

22:56.042 --> 22:57.677
and who hasn't?

22:57.677 --> 22:58.811
>> CHANDI: Not all transwomen

22:58.811 --> 23:00.046
choose to have the surgery to

23:00.046 --> 23:01.247
have a vagina.

23:01.247 --> 23:02.314
>> SCOTT: It's unbelievable that

23:02.314 --> 23:03.315
the body can do this.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.016
>> ELLA: Isn't it?

23:04.016 --> 23:05.151
>> SCOTT: It's almost like, you

23:05.151 --> 23:06.886
know, when you build a car, you

23:06.886 --> 23:07.887
can change the wheels up.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.621
>> CHANDI: Right.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.789
>> SCOTT: It's like God made the

23:09.789 --> 23:10.857
body, and able to do it.

23:10.857 --> 23:11.924
>> JENNY: It's like a car,

23:11.924 --> 23:12.559
that's right.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.259
It's like a car.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.260
>> SCOTT: I'm just saying...

23:14.260 --> 23:15.127
>> JENNY: I appreciate...

23:15.127 --> 23:15.995
>> SCOTT: It's like a pit stop.

23:15.995 --> 23:16.829
(imitates electric drills)

23:16.829 --> 23:17.830
>> JENNY: That's exactly right.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.831
That's exactly it.

23:18.831 --> 23:19.365
>> SCOTT: Boom.

23:19.365 --> 23:20.366
>> JENNY: That's what it was

23:20.366 --> 23:21.367
like for me.

23:21.367 --> 23:22.569
We have to find a way of talking

23:22.569 --> 23:23.570
about surgery.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.037
And joking about it isn't the

23:25.037 --> 23:26.806
solution, but I get that this is

23:26.806 --> 23:28.340
Scott's way of trying to find a

23:28.340 --> 23:29.341
way to relate to something

23:29.341 --> 23:30.477
that's so new to him.

23:30.477 --> 23:31.478
>> SCOTT: Is there any

23:31.478 --> 23:32.479
maintenance?

23:32.479 --> 23:33.279
>> JENNY: Not particularly.

23:33.279 --> 23:33.946
There's some.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.947
>> SCOTT: You don't have to go

23:34.947 --> 23:35.948
in for tune-ups?

23:35.948 --> 23:36.949
>> JENNY: So, here-here's

23:36.949 --> 23:37.750
the thing...

23:37.750 --> 23:38.751
>> SCOTT: I need it to relate to

23:38.751 --> 23:39.251
cars.

23:39.251 --> 23:39.852
>> COURTNEY: Oil change?

23:39.852 --> 23:41.120
>> SCOTT: An oil change.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.121
>> JENNY: There's an oil change,

23:42.121 --> 23:43.490
definitely, yeah.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.491
The... I guess the important

23:44.491 --> 23:45.758
thing, though, is we're not

23:45.758 --> 23:46.859
about an operation.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.260
We're about soul.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.295
>> SCOTT: Obviously, the soul

23:49.295 --> 23:50.062
part is the first, and the most

23:50.062 --> 23:50.597
important...

23:50.597 --> 23:51.163
>> JENNY: Yeah.

23:51.163 --> 23:51.798
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

23:51.798 --> 23:52.599
>> SCOTT: But the other stuff

23:52.599 --> 23:53.533
comes along with the territory.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.133
>> CHANDI: Right.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.134
>> SCOTT: I just kind of want to

23:55.134 --> 23:56.235
have knowledge.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.837
Just because, don't forget,

23:57.837 --> 23:59.606
people ask me these type of

23:59.606 --> 24:00.640
questions, and I would love to

24:00.640 --> 24:01.708
be able to have the right

24:01.708 --> 24:03.142
answers, especially for the

24:03.142 --> 24:04.511
straight person that's not

24:04.511 --> 24:07.914
understanding, to... anything.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.215
>> JENNY: I don't generally talk

24:09.215 --> 24:10.583
about down below, because, you

24:10.583 --> 24:11.584
know, that's private.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.619
>> SCOTT: I mean, listen, I like

24:12.619 --> 24:13.620
to know the interior color on a

24:13.620 --> 24:15.387
car, like, I mean...

24:15.387 --> 24:16.388
>> COURTNEY: Pick out the

24:16.388 --> 24:16.889
accessories.

24:16.889 --> 24:17.990
>> JENNY: It's pink.

24:17.990 --> 24:18.991
>> SCOTT: Oh!

24:18.991 --> 24:21.127
I-I'm being inappropriate.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.529
>> CHANDI: Yeah, right.

24:22.529 --> 24:25.164
>> SCOTT: Anything else?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.165
(horn blows)

24:26.165 --> 24:28.134
(Candis whoops)

24:35.942 --> 24:37.944
>> CAITLYN: Chandi's mom is in

24:37.944 --> 24:38.545
town, baby.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.546
Hello, baby, how're you doing?

24:39.546 --> 24:40.412
>> TINA: You look so beautiful!

24:40.412 --> 24:41.180
>> CAITLYN: Thank you, baby, so

24:41.180 --> 24:41.681
do you.

24:41.681 --> 24:42.281
>> TINA: Baby, you look

24:42.281 --> 24:42.782
beautiful.

24:42.782 --> 24:43.783
>> CAITLYN: Look at you, you are

24:43.783 --> 24:44.283
just...

24:44.283 --> 24:45.284
>> TINA: Come get my hug.

24:45.284 --> 24:45.918
>> CANDIS: Hi!

24:45.918 --> 24:46.919
>> TINA: Hi, honey.

24:46.919 --> 24:47.554
>> KATE: Hello.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.588
>> TINA: Hi.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.589
Give me my other...

24:49.589 --> 24:50.422
>> KATE: Absolutely.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.023
>> TINA: How are you?

24:51.023 --> 24:52.024
>> KATE: I'm good, I see now

24:52.024 --> 24:52.659
where Chandi gets her good

24:52.659 --> 24:53.192
looks.

24:53.192 --> 24:53.760
>> TINA: Oh!

24:53.760 --> 24:54.260
>> KATE: Right?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.061
>> CHANDI: You didn't meet

24:55.061 --> 24:55.562
Scott.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.395
>> TINA: Hi, Scott.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.229
>> SCOTT: I haven't transitioned

24:57.229 --> 24:57.797
yet.

24:57.797 --> 24:58.397
(Chandi laughs)

24:58.397 --> 24:59.566
>> TINA: Come give me a hug.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.567
(kisses)

25:00.567 --> 25:01.601
Good to see you.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.602
>> SCOTT: Next month, it's gonna

25:02.602 --> 25:03.469
be a new me.

25:03.469 --> 25:04.203
>> CHANDI: Scott is not

25:04.203 --> 25:05.171
transitioning, he's just playing

25:05.171 --> 25:05.772
games.

25:05.772 --> 25:06.305
>> TINA: Okay.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.306
>> SCOTT: I'm just playing.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.307
>> CAITLYN: Let's go.

25:08.307 --> 25:11.043
Get something to eat.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.880
*

25:13.880 --> 25:17.449
(indistinct chatter)

25:17.449 --> 25:18.450
>> SERVER: What you in the mood

25:18.450 --> 25:19.451
for-- you want to do beer,

25:19.451 --> 25:20.452
liquor?

25:20.452 --> 25:21.588
Coc... specialty cocktails.

25:21.588 --> 25:22.789
>> CAITLYN: In a mixed drink

25:22.789 --> 25:25.091
that you would say, "Oh, wow,

25:25.091 --> 25:26.392
this is a mixed drink for here."

25:26.392 --> 25:27.393
>> SERVER: I have a hurricane...

25:27.393 --> 25:28.327
>> CANDIS: Hey.

25:28.327 --> 25:28.895
>> ANDREW: Hi.

25:28.895 --> 25:29.796
>> CANDIS: Have a seat.

25:29.796 --> 25:30.663
>> ANDREW: Thank you, thank you.

25:30.663 --> 25:31.598
>> SERVER: Um, I also have a

25:31.598 --> 25:32.198
sazerac.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.032
>> CANDIS: Do you want a drink?

25:33.032 --> 25:34.033
>> ANDREW: Sure.

25:34.033 --> 25:34.801
>> CHANDI: I got the pictures

25:34.801 --> 25:35.401
with Bill Clinton.

25:35.401 --> 25:36.603
>> TINA: Yeah, look at you with

25:36.603 --> 25:37.303
Clinton-- okay.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.004
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.005
>> TINA: Please save that.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.139
>> CHANDI: I... Of course.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.140
>> ELLA: That's a gorgeous

25:41.140 --> 25:42.141
dress, too.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.142
>> CAITLYN: Look at that.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.176
He's the designer.

25:44.176 --> 25:44.977
>> JENNY: Scott, where are you

25:44.977 --> 25:45.745
from, originally?

25:45.745 --> 25:46.679
>> SCOTT: Uh, New York state.

25:46.679 --> 25:47.614
>> JENNY: Near a city?

25:47.614 --> 25:48.447
I lived in Maine for ten years.

25:48.447 --> 25:49.448
>> SCOTT: I lived in Vermont for

25:49.448 --> 25:50.449
a while.

25:50.449 --> 25:50.950
>> JENNY: Yeah?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.384
Are you the guy, who, when

25:52.384 --> 25:54.754
talking about your own, like,

25:54.754 --> 25:55.755
pain and trouble and

25:55.755 --> 25:56.623
suffering...

25:56.623 --> 25:57.089
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.090
>> JENNY: ...you're the, "Oh,

25:58.090 --> 25:58.891
no, it's not a big deal" guy,

25:58.891 --> 25:59.892
are you that guy?

25:59.892 --> 26:01.060
>> SCOTT: No, I'm pretty open

26:01.060 --> 26:03.395
with... that I've gone through

26:03.395 --> 26:05.197
things that have hurt me a ton.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.198
>> JENNY: Tell me if you don't

26:06.198 --> 26:07.199
want to go-go down this rabbit

26:07.199 --> 26:08.400
hole of, like, getting divorced.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.401
>> SCOTT: Yeah, no, I was never

26:09.401 --> 26:10.069
married.

26:10.069 --> 26:10.837
>> JENNY: Yeah, but you were...

26:10.837 --> 26:11.838
but you were a couple.

26:11.838 --> 26:12.639
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

26:12.639 --> 26:13.505
>> JENNY: And now you're not a

26:13.505 --> 26:14.373
couple and that's-that's got

26:14.373 --> 26:15.074
to... that's got to hurt.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.075
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.543
Well, yeah, no, it's very tough.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.544
You know, I made a lot of

26:18.544 --> 26:19.779
decisions that weren't great,

26:19.779 --> 26:20.379
you know?

26:20.379 --> 26:21.380
>> JENNY: So, do you think you

26:21.380 --> 26:22.381
can... I don't want to say "win

26:22.381 --> 26:23.382
her back", but do you think you

26:23.382 --> 26:23.916
can...

26:23.916 --> 26:25.017
>> SCOTT: Oh, I don't know.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.353
I have absolutely no control

26:27.353 --> 26:29.421
over an... everybody and anybody

26:29.421 --> 26:30.923
else, other than myself.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.558
And all I can do is just stay on

26:32.558 --> 26:33.660
the right path, and if things

26:33.660 --> 26:34.761
fall into place and they're

26:34.761 --> 26:36.062
meant to be, I believe that they

26:36.062 --> 26:37.063
will be.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.164
>> JENNY: Right.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.165
Scott made a real effort to come

26:39.165 --> 26:41.834
all the way, to-to be with us,

26:41.834 --> 26:44.470
and I'm glad I got to bond with

26:44.470 --> 26:45.672
him a little.

26:45.672 --> 26:46.706
But it's just kind of ironic.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.807
I'm not the person he came there

26:47.807 --> 26:49.676
to bond with.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.810
>> KIP: Oh, my God! Wow!

26:50.810 --> 26:51.811
>> JENNY: Have you ever had an

26:51.811 --> 26:52.812
oyster?

26:52.812 --> 26:53.846
>> CANDIS: Chandi likes oysters.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.147
>> SCOTT: Caitlyn, I haven't

26:55.147 --> 26:56.582
talked to you all night.

26:56.582 --> 26:57.583
>> CAITLYN: I know.

26:57.583 --> 26:58.584
>> JENNY: She can sit over here.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.318
>> SCOTT: No, no.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.052
>> COURTNEY: Are you ignoring

27:00.052 --> 27:00.720
him?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.788
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not ignoring

27:01.788 --> 27:02.789
him.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.990
He's over there.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.693
>> SCOTT: I'm not that far.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.827
>> CAITLYN: But, for me, with my

27:07.827 --> 27:09.428
ears, you are that far, yeah.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.763
>> SCOTT: I... Is it really your

27:10.763 --> 27:12.364
ears, or you just don't want to

27:12.364 --> 27:14.333
listen?

27:18.437 --> 27:19.438
>> CANDIS: You're cute. I could

27:19.438 --> 27:21.240
totally kiss you.

27:21.240 --> 27:26.078
What are you... thinking?

27:26.078 --> 27:27.546
>> SCOTT: I'm here for you. I'm

27:27.546 --> 27:29.849
not here for just your people.

27:29.849 --> 27:30.850
>> CAITLYN: I know. Have a seat.

27:30.850 --> 27:31.851
>> SCOTT: You know what I mean?

27:31.851 --> 27:32.518
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know.

27:32.518 --> 27:33.519
>> SCOTT: I've spent more time

27:33.519 --> 27:35.487
with them than I have with you.

27:39.759 --> 27:40.559
>> SCOTT: I haven't talked to

27:40.559 --> 27:41.227
you all night.

27:41.227 --> 27:41.894
>> CAITLYN: I know.

27:41.894 --> 27:42.628
>> JENNY: She can sit over here.

27:42.628 --> 27:43.295
>> SCOTT: No, no.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.030
>> COURTNEY: Are you ignoring

27:44.030 --> 27:44.731
him?

27:44.731 --> 27:45.732
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not ignoring

27:45.732 --> 27:46.365
him.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.433
He's over there.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.801
>> SCOTT: I'm not that far.

27:48.801 --> 27:49.802
>> CAITLYN: But, for me, with my

27:49.802 --> 27:50.937
ears, you are that far, yeah.

27:50.937 --> 27:51.938
>> SCOTT: Is it really your

27:51.938 --> 27:52.939
ears, or you just don't want to

27:52.939 --> 27:53.940
listen?

27:53.940 --> 27:54.941
>> CAITLYN: Well, maybe two...

27:54.941 --> 27:56.208
Yeah, one of two things, yeah.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.209
>> SCOTT: I always wondered.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.210
>> CAITLYN: Combination.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.812
>> SCOTT: Okay. I'll settle with

27:59.812 --> 28:01.080
both.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.281
>> CAITLYN: Boom, you got it.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.282
>> SCOTT: Good night, ladies

28:03.282 --> 28:04.984
and... gentlemen.

28:04.984 --> 28:08.855
>> CAITLYN: "Ladies" is enough.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.156
>> KATE: I think he's upset or

28:10.156 --> 28:12.291
embarrassed or something.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.559
He went bam.

28:13.559 --> 28:14.626
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah, I

28:14.626 --> 28:15.627
have... I've known Scott for a

28:15.627 --> 28:16.763
long time, yeah.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.297
And I would much rather deal

28:18.297 --> 28:19.565
with something like that, which

28:19.565 --> 28:20.566
is a little strange, than having

28:20.566 --> 28:22.301
to deal with him being, you

28:22.301 --> 28:23.535
know, hammered, you know, all

28:23.535 --> 28:24.536
the things that go along with

28:24.536 --> 28:26.505
that.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.377
(crickets chirping)

28:34.446 --> 28:35.547
>> CANDIS: I'm gonna go grab a

28:35.547 --> 28:36.783
drink with Andrew.

28:36.783 --> 28:37.784
>> CAITLYN: Don't do anything I

28:37.784 --> 28:39.518
wouldn't do.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.519
>> CANDIS: You have ten

28:40.519 --> 28:41.620
children.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.621
(both laugh)

28:42.621 --> 28:43.422
>> CAITLYN: I'll see you guys

28:43.422 --> 28:44.090
later.

28:44.090 --> 28:44.791
>> CANDIS: Gonna go have a

28:44.791 --> 28:45.792
drink.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.093
Have a good night, you guys!

28:47.093 --> 28:48.094
>> ELLA: Love you.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.161
>> ANDREW: Let's have a drink.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.897
>> CANDIS: Let's have a drink.

28:50.897 --> 28:51.898
>> ANDREW: Have you ever had a

28:51.898 --> 28:52.899
Moscow Mule?

28:52.899 --> 28:54.233
>> CANDIS: I did recently.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.701
>> ANDREW: You want to try some?

28:55.701 --> 28:56.702
>> CANDIS: Yeah, I'll try it.

28:56.702 --> 28:57.870
>> ANDREW: There we go.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.872
>> CANDIS: Mmm, I like it.

28:59.872 --> 29:00.873
>> ANDREW: It's good.

29:00.873 --> 29:01.941
>> CANDIS: The ginger is a nice

29:01.941 --> 29:02.608
flavor.

29:02.608 --> 29:03.609
>> ANDREW: I know. So you

29:03.609 --> 29:04.610
haven't seen the Arch yet.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.611
This is... this is the closest

29:05.611 --> 29:06.612
you've been so far.

29:06.612 --> 29:07.613
>> CANDIS: Yeah. This is, like,

29:07.613 --> 29:09.581
the best view.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.983
Let's go out and look.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.119
>> ANDREW: Let's go.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.821
Man, it's windy.

29:14.821 --> 29:15.822
>> CANDIS: It is kind of windy.

29:15.822 --> 29:16.823
I'll be fine.

29:16.823 --> 29:17.423
>> ANDREW: Are you sure?

29:17.423 --> 29:18.090
You want my jacket?

29:18.090 --> 29:18.891
>> CANDIS: Okay.

29:18.891 --> 29:19.892
>> ANDREW: All right.

29:19.892 --> 29:23.029
There you go. Okay.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.396
>> CANDIS: Are you cold now?

29:24.396 --> 29:25.464
>> ANDREW: I'm good.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.465
As long as you're warm.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.133
>> CANDIS: Here.

29:27.133 --> 29:27.834
>> ANDREW: Oh.

29:27.834 --> 29:28.467
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.268
>> ANDREW: I'll get under the

29:29.268 --> 29:29.936
jacket?

29:29.936 --> 29:30.937
>> CANDIS: You have to share it

29:30.937 --> 29:31.603
with me.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.405
You're gonna get cold.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.941
There's no denying there is a

29:34.941 --> 29:36.308
little bit of chemistry there,

29:36.308 --> 29:38.277
and so it's really nice to be

29:38.277 --> 29:39.912
able to, like, actually have

29:39.912 --> 29:41.613
something with somebody that I

29:41.613 --> 29:42.614
like.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.883
I have to say, you're a very

29:43.883 --> 29:44.884
sweet guy.

29:44.884 --> 29:45.885
>> ANDREW: Well, thank you.

29:45.885 --> 29:46.886
You're amazing.

29:46.886 --> 29:47.887
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

29:47.887 --> 29:48.554
>> ANDREW: You are amazing.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.221
You're sweet.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.222
>> CANDIS: Are you nervous?

29:50.222 --> 29:51.223
Am I making you nervous?

29:51.223 --> 29:52.224
>> ANDREW: No, you're not making

29:52.224 --> 29:52.892
me nervous.

29:52.892 --> 29:53.893
You're not making me nervous.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.161
>> CANDIS: Okay, good.

29:55.161 --> 29:58.931
Um... well, I'm just kind of,

29:58.931 --> 30:00.066
like, one of those people that

30:00.066 --> 30:01.067
kind of goes with the flow.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.068
You know what I mean?

30:02.068 --> 30:04.971
Just like... What-what are

30:04.971 --> 30:08.975
you... thinking?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.242
>> ANDREW: Are you meaning like

30:10.242 --> 30:12.644
more than... what's going on

30:12.644 --> 30:13.679
right here?

30:13.679 --> 30:14.914
>> CANDIS: Well, I mean, of

30:14.914 --> 30:15.915
course.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.084
I'm, like... You're cute.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.385
I could totally kiss you.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.386
You know, that kind of thing.

30:20.386 --> 30:24.223
>> ANDREW: Mm-hmm.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.424
I don't think I really could go

30:25.424 --> 30:27.526
there just yet.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.095
You know?

30:29.095 --> 30:31.998
>> CANDIS: Okay.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.765
Okay, well, I've... (laughs)

30:33.765 --> 30:35.601
On that note, I'm gonna go to

30:35.601 --> 30:36.602
bed.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.470
>> ANDREW: Okay. You okay?

30:38.470 --> 30:39.505
>> CANDIS: No, I'm good.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.539
I'll see you...

30:40.539 --> 30:41.540
>> ANDREW: So, tomorrow morning?

30:41.540 --> 30:43.742
>> CANDIS: I'll-I'll call you.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.711
>> ANDREW: Candis.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.718
>> CANDIS: I just felt like

30:52.718 --> 30:54.586
maybe we had a connection, and

30:54.586 --> 30:55.787
then I just assumed it was

30:55.787 --> 30:58.324
'cause of the trans thing.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.759
>> ANDREW: It's, um... I just...

31:03.295 --> 31:04.296
>> CAITLYN: What were your big

31:04.296 --> 31:05.965
concerns?

31:05.965 --> 31:07.599
>> TINA: I'm a person that's,

31:07.599 --> 31:09.701
uh, very religious.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.770
I was very hurt.

31:14.974 --> 31:15.975
>> CAITLYN: All right, we're

31:15.975 --> 31:16.642
recording.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.644
You know, tough day coming up.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.147
This is my first day to

31:21.147 --> 31:23.715
participate in the Transgender

31:23.715 --> 31:25.451
Day of Remembrance.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.319
Uh, we've lost a lot of very

31:27.319 --> 31:28.487
good people that should be with

31:28.487 --> 31:29.755
us here today.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.257
Um, it's a very emotional time

31:31.257 --> 31:33.559
for my community and for people

31:33.559 --> 31:34.793
all around the world.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.828
So, tough day for everybody,

31:36.828 --> 31:40.432
but, uh, we need to do it.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.968
(doorbell rings)

31:41.968 --> 31:43.002
>> CANDIS: Hello?

31:43.002 --> 31:44.036
>> ANDREW: Hey.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.204
>> CANDIS: Hey. Come on in.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.205
>> ANDREW: How's it going?

31:46.205 --> 31:47.206
>> CANDIS: It's going good.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.207
>> ANDREW: Good. Do you have

31:48.207 --> 31:48.975
time to talk?

31:48.975 --> 31:49.976
>> CANDIS: Yeah, sure.

31:49.976 --> 31:50.977
How are you? What's up?

31:50.977 --> 31:51.978
What's going on?

31:51.978 --> 31:52.979
>> ANDREW: Good. Uh, nothing,

31:52.979 --> 31:53.980
just getting ready.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.481
Got to head out later on today.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.482
Some things came up, so I have

31:56.482 --> 31:57.549
to fly out.

31:57.549 --> 31:58.750
>> CANDIS: Okay.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.519
>> ANDREW: Yeah. But, um... So,

32:00.519 --> 32:01.687
last night, what happened?

32:01.687 --> 32:02.989
>> CANDIS: I don't know. I just

32:02.989 --> 32:04.323
was kind of over it, to be

32:04.323 --> 32:05.657
honest with you.

32:05.657 --> 32:09.061
>> ANDREW: But over what?

32:09.061 --> 32:10.296
>> CANDIS: I don't know. We were

32:10.296 --> 32:11.797
talking and I was like, "What's

32:11.797 --> 32:12.999
going on with you?"

32:12.999 --> 32:14.000
And you were like, "I can't do

32:14.000 --> 32:15.001
this."

32:15.001 --> 32:16.068
>> ANDREW: Right, right.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.236
>> CANDIS: I just felt like we

32:17.236 --> 32:17.903
had, you know...

32:17.903 --> 32:18.570
>> ANDREW: Like, something.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.238
>> CANDIS: ...something.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.239
>> ANDREW: Like a spark?

32:20.239 --> 32:21.307
>> CANDIS: So, I-I don't know.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.009
I mean... I... And then I just

32:23.009 --> 32:24.043
assumed it was 'cause of the

32:24.043 --> 32:27.146
trans thing and...

32:27.146 --> 32:30.149
>> ANDREW: It's, um... I just...

32:32.184 --> 32:33.419
You could say yes. That could

32:33.419 --> 32:35.054
be... Uh, uh, but, honestly,

32:35.054 --> 32:36.188
that's a big issue, yes.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.423
Um, but at the same time, like,

32:37.423 --> 32:38.790
there's noth... there's no

32:38.790 --> 32:39.791
judgment, there's no anything

32:39.791 --> 32:41.493
like that, um, by all means.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.761
It's just something that... it's

32:42.761 --> 32:45.131
just not me.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.732
>> CANDIS: All right.

32:46.732 --> 32:50.469
Um... I kind of knew it was the

32:50.469 --> 32:51.903
trans thing.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.672
It's like the-the tables are

32:53.672 --> 32:55.441
stacked against you, you know,

32:55.441 --> 32:57.176
your whole life.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.178
It's tough, because you never

32:59.178 --> 33:01.147
have a break, you know?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.351
Sometimes you get glimmers of

33:05.351 --> 33:08.620
that moment that could be, and

33:08.620 --> 33:10.056
then most of the time it doesn't

33:10.056 --> 33:11.557
happen.

33:11.557 --> 33:14.926
It really hits home.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.735
(indistinct chatter)

33:23.735 --> 33:24.736
>> CAITLYN: Good morning.

33:24.736 --> 33:25.471
There you are.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.272
>> TINA: How's my baby doing

33:26.272 --> 33:26.938
today?

33:26.938 --> 33:27.673
>> CAITLYN: Mama, I'm doing

33:27.673 --> 33:28.340
good.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.341
Let's get some breakfast going.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.542
>> TINA: Okay.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.743
>> CAITLYN: The other night,

33:31.743 --> 33:35.247
when I was, uh, in Chicago, we

33:35.247 --> 33:36.382
went to the Baton...

33:36.382 --> 33:37.383
>> TINA: Uh-huh.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.384
>> CAITLYN: ...and Chandi was

33:38.384 --> 33:39.385
bringing the house down.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.386
>> TINA: Uh-huh, yeah, looking

33:40.386 --> 33:41.387
like Patti LaBelle, huh?

33:41.387 --> 33:42.388
>> CAITLYN: Have you been to her

33:42.388 --> 33:43.389
shows?

33:43.389 --> 33:44.790
>> TINA: Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.094
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Since today is

33:48.094 --> 33:49.095
Transgender Day of

33:49.095 --> 33:50.096
Remembrance...

33:50.096 --> 33:51.097
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.098
>> CAITLYN: I kind of heard

33:52.098 --> 33:54.366
that, at the beginning, it was

33:54.366 --> 33:55.667
tough on you.

33:55.667 --> 33:59.905
What were your big concerns?

33:59.905 --> 34:01.207
>> TINA: At first, I was very

34:01.207 --> 34:02.908
hurt.

34:02.908 --> 34:05.877
I questioned myself as a mom.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.848
>> KATE: We are the first

34:09.848 --> 34:11.950
generations who are actively

34:11.950 --> 34:13.885
bringing about the end of

34:13.885 --> 34:15.621
transphobia.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.657
(cheering)

34:18.657 --> 34:20.126
>> CAITLYN: I have been isolated

34:20.126 --> 34:21.560
my entire life.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.661
I-I never felt like I fit in

34:22.661 --> 34:24.630
anywhere.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.931
And I know that's probably the

34:25.931 --> 34:27.466
feeling that you get sometimes.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.136
>> SCOTT: Yeah, that's for sure.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.139
>> TINA: At first, I was very

34:33.139 --> 34:33.772
hurt.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.841
I questioned myself as a mom.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.343
Took me a while to get my grips

34:37.343 --> 34:38.577
on this here.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.578
'Cause first of all, I'd

34:39.578 --> 34:40.579
never...

34:40.579 --> 34:41.580
>> CAITLYN: I was gonna say, you

34:41.580 --> 34:43.649
had no idea what even the word

34:43.649 --> 34:45.284
"transgender" was, did you?

34:45.284 --> 34:46.685
A-And... Which is most cases,

34:46.685 --> 34:47.853
yeah.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.020
>> TINA: When I started looking

34:49.020 --> 34:50.922
at the fact and I'm seeing the

34:50.922 --> 34:53.425
things around my child-- young

34:53.425 --> 34:58.164
ladies getting murdered, young

34:58.164 --> 35:03.602
ladies are being abused-- would

35:03.602 --> 35:06.037
I want my child like that?

35:06.037 --> 35:07.706
No. No.

35:07.706 --> 35:08.907
>> CAITLYN: Did you have fear

35:08.907 --> 35:11.177
for her safety at the beginning?

35:11.177 --> 35:13.011
>> TINA: Yes, I did.

35:13.011 --> 35:13.945
And yeah, I still fear.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.946
>> CAITLYN: You still feel that

35:14.946 --> 35:15.447
way?

35:15.447 --> 35:16.582
>> TINA: Yes. Yes.

35:16.582 --> 35:17.983
>> CAITLYN: It's hard for me to

35:17.983 --> 35:19.518
accept that Chandi could

35:19.518 --> 35:22.554
actually be at risk just being

35:22.554 --> 35:23.922
out in the public.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.291
Unfortunately, this is the

35:25.291 --> 35:26.592
reality of living in a

35:26.592 --> 35:28.794
transphobic world that doesn't

35:28.794 --> 35:30.729
accept trans people.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.231
>> TINA: You know, I am a person

35:32.231 --> 35:35.033
that's, uh, very religious, and

35:35.033 --> 35:38.437
I think what really keeps me on

35:38.437 --> 35:40.406
the positive side is that just

35:40.406 --> 35:42.641
because my child might not be

35:42.641 --> 35:45.010
like me... but they're still my

35:45.010 --> 35:47.213
child.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.214
So that's what God said in his

35:48.214 --> 35:49.215
word.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.350
He said, your, uh, situations

35:51.350 --> 35:52.351
may be a little different, but

35:52.351 --> 35:53.352
guess what?

35:53.352 --> 35:54.353
He made us all.

35:54.353 --> 35:55.354
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.355
>> TINA: We have to learn how to

35:56.355 --> 35:58.424
love and accept them for what

35:58.424 --> 35:59.425
they are.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.092
You can't be pulling against

36:01.092 --> 36:02.228
them, you got to pull for 'em.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.262
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.296
>> TINA: Especially when... when

36:04.296 --> 36:06.465
you have a child that's about

36:06.465 --> 36:07.699
doing something positive.

36:07.699 --> 36:08.700
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.035
You just have to be so proud of

36:10.035 --> 36:11.237
what she's doing.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.238
>> TINA: I'm very proud.

36:12.238 --> 36:12.738
>> CAITLYN: You know?

36:12.738 --> 36:13.672
>> TINA: I'm very proud.

36:13.672 --> 36:14.340
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.308
>> TINA: I really am.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.480
(elevator beeping)

36:21.480 --> 36:22.914
(elevator bell dings)

36:22.914 --> 36:23.915
>> CAITLYN: Chandi's mom is

36:23.915 --> 36:26.117
such an inspiration, 'cause she

36:26.117 --> 36:29.388
never gave up on her child.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.389
And look how Chandi has

36:30.389 --> 36:31.390
turned out-- she's doing so

36:31.390 --> 36:32.391
much good.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.392
Kind of the same way I feel with

36:33.392 --> 36:34.393
Scott.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.027
I always wanna be there for him.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.829
I don't wanna give up on Scott,

36:37.829 --> 36:39.698
and hopefully, he can turn his

36:39.698 --> 36:42.268
life around.

36:42.268 --> 36:44.270
>> SCOTT: Coming! Com...

36:44.270 --> 36:46.272
>> CAITLYN: It's locked!

36:46.272 --> 36:46.938
Scotty.

36:46.938 --> 36:47.939
>> SCOTT: If you're a woman now,

36:47.939 --> 36:48.940
I think you need to tone down

36:48.940 --> 36:49.441
your knock.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.442
>> CAITLYN: You think so?

36:50.442 --> 36:51.443
It should be more gentle?

36:51.443 --> 36:52.444
(Scott pounding on door)

36:52.444 --> 36:53.445
Not like that?

36:53.445 --> 36:53.945
>> SCOTT: Yeah.

36:53.945 --> 36:54.946
>> CAITLYN: How you doin'?

36:54.946 --> 36:55.947
>> SCOTT: What's happening?

36:55.947 --> 36:57.048
>> CAITLYN: Well, I heard you

36:57.048 --> 36:58.049
were thinking about leaving,

36:58.049 --> 36:59.050
number one.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.786
And I don't think you should.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.788
We have this ceremony tonight, I

37:02.788 --> 37:03.855
think it would be good for you.

37:03.855 --> 37:04.956
>> SCOTT: Yeah, but again, I'm

37:04.956 --> 37:05.957
here for you.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.194
I'm not here for just... your

37:09.194 --> 37:11.963
people.

37:11.963 --> 37:12.698
>> CAITLYN: I know. Have a seat.

37:12.698 --> 37:13.665
>> SCOTT: You know what I mean?

37:13.665 --> 37:14.666
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know,

37:14.666 --> 37:15.667
>> SCOTT: I've spent more time

37:15.667 --> 37:18.637
with them than I have with you.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.309
>> SCOTT: I'm here for you.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.210
I'm not here for just... your

37:25.210 --> 37:25.711
people.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.712
>> CAITLYN: Have a s... have a

37:26.712 --> 37:27.212
seat.

37:27.212 --> 37:28.213
>> SCOTT: You know what I mean?

37:28.213 --> 37:28.880
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know,

37:28.880 --> 37:29.881
>> SCOTT: I've spent more time

37:29.881 --> 37:31.082
with them than I have with you.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.352
>> CAITLYN: But... I know.

37:33.352 --> 37:36.322
But... all of these people have

37:36.322 --> 37:38.056
a lot in common with you.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.057
(Scott sighs)

37:39.057 --> 37:40.426
I have been isolated my entire

37:40.426 --> 37:41.427
life.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.794
I-I never felt like I fit in

37:42.794 --> 37:43.962
anywhere.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.464
When I finally decided to be

37:45.464 --> 37:47.899
true with myself and come out, I

37:47.899 --> 37:49.468
surrounded myself with some

37:49.468 --> 37:52.070
really great people-- all these

37:52.070 --> 37:53.939
girls that have so much in

37:53.939 --> 37:55.874
common with me.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.109
My life changed around

37:58.109 --> 37:59.345
immediately.

37:59.345 --> 38:00.412
And I feel like you're kind of

38:00.412 --> 38:02.113
in the same place here.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.782
The-the whole, you know,

38:03.782 --> 38:05.150
drinking thing and all that

38:05.150 --> 38:06.385
kind of stuff-- it just...

38:06.385 --> 38:07.386
it's not good.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.420
And you certainly don't find

38:08.420 --> 38:09.421
happiness there.

38:09.421 --> 38:09.921
>> SCOTT: Mm-mm.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.057
I used to always think that when

38:12.057 --> 38:14.192
I was drunk the real me came

38:14.192 --> 38:15.193
out.

38:15.193 --> 38:16.728
And I always thought the real me

38:16.728 --> 38:18.029
was a bad person.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.230
And I've realized that, you

38:19.230 --> 38:21.367
know, substances make people

38:21.367 --> 38:22.468
something else.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.969
It's not really who they are.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.371
So I've been able to kind of

38:25.371 --> 38:27.038
forgive myself for all the

38:27.038 --> 38:28.640
things, and now I'm just

38:28.640 --> 38:30.376
focusing on actually being me.

38:30.376 --> 38:31.643
I've just been happy for the

38:31.643 --> 38:32.644
first time in a long time.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.645
>> CAITLYN: You got to make some

38:33.645 --> 38:34.713
major changes, but it's all for

38:34.713 --> 38:35.714
the good.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.882
Now, I mean, I look at my life

38:36.882 --> 38:38.650
now, I've never been in a better

38:38.650 --> 38:39.718
place in life than I am right

38:39.718 --> 38:40.719
now.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.187
Better than the Games, standing

38:42.187 --> 38:43.755
on top of a platform.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.123
>> SCOTT: You know, whatever you

38:45.123 --> 38:46.124
want to do,

38:46.124 --> 38:47.158
and I'm there to do with you.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.193
>> CAITLYN: I want you to know

38:48.193 --> 38:49.495
that I'm there for you, too.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.162
It seems like Scott is getting

38:51.162 --> 38:53.131
his act together.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.066
He seems more self-aware.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.702
To me, that's progress.

38:56.702 --> 38:57.836
I've been through a lot.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.004
He's been through a lot.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.205
And it's not going through these

39:00.205 --> 39:01.707
issues, it's how you come out

39:01.707 --> 39:02.774
the other side.

39:02.774 --> 39:03.775
It's all good.

39:03.775 --> 39:04.776
Life's very short, as we all

39:04.776 --> 39:05.777
know.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.012
>> SCOTT: Yeah, that's for sure.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.013
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.214
Don't throw it away.

39:09.214 --> 39:10.215
Yeah.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.517
>> SCOTT: Listen, now that we've

39:11.517 --> 39:12.584
had this talk, I mean, I feel

39:12.584 --> 39:13.719
more comfortable.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.721
I just felt like... I felt a

39:15.721 --> 39:17.088
little bit of an outsider, even

39:17.088 --> 39:19.491
here, so it kind of got me down.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.693
But I can... I can push the

39:21.693 --> 39:22.794
flight a little and go with you

39:22.794 --> 39:23.795
to this... remembrance thing.

39:23.795 --> 39:24.863
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, no I think...

39:24.863 --> 39:26.064
I think it'd be good, yeah,

39:26.064 --> 39:27.065
I think it would be good to go.

39:27.065 --> 39:27.799
>> SCOTT: All right.

39:27.799 --> 39:28.934
>> CAITLYN: Give me a hug.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.135
Good.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.670
All right, we'll see you.

39:31.670 --> 39:32.671
Get ready.

39:32.671 --> 39:33.672
>> SCOTT: You may need to tone

39:33.672 --> 39:34.673
down your hugs, too, with the...

39:34.673 --> 39:35.674
>> CAITLYN: It's good.

39:35.674 --> 39:36.675
>> SCOTT: It's like the door

39:36.675 --> 39:37.676
knock.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.645
>> CAITLYN: I know.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.050
>> CANDIS: Hi. Hi. How are you?

39:45.050 --> 39:45.984
>> LEON: Hi!

39:45.984 --> 39:46.985
>> CANDIS: Candis.

39:46.985 --> 39:47.986
>> MISS LEON: Hi. I'm Miss Leon.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.054
Nice to meet you.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.055
Here you go.

39:50.055 --> 39:50.556
>> CAITLYN: Hello.

39:50.556 --> 39:51.557
How are you doing?

39:51.557 --> 39:53.459
Nice to see you.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.893
>> CHANDI: Having my mom here

39:54.893 --> 39:56.194
for Transgender Day of

39:56.194 --> 39:59.030
Remembrance is so amazing.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.066
And it will be great for her to

40:01.066 --> 40:03.401
be amongst all these trans

40:03.401 --> 40:06.371
people who are paying homage to

40:06.371 --> 40:07.906
those who have been lost this

40:07.906 --> 40:08.907
year.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.175
>> SPEAKER: So, now we will hear

40:10.175 --> 40:11.477
the names and the stories of

40:11.477 --> 40:13.579
some of those lives.

40:13.579 --> 40:17.315
>> WOMAN: Ty Underwood, age 29.

40:17.315 --> 40:20.418
Kristina Gomes Reinwald, age 46.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.453
>> CANDIS: We've had a really

40:21.453 --> 40:22.621
tough year.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.689
(crying): But when you read the

40:23.689 --> 40:26.458
names, it really hits home.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.459
>> CAITLYN: Amber Monroe.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.460
>> VARIOUS VOICES: London

40:28.460 --> 40:29.761

40:41.072 --> 40:42.107

40:42.107 --> 40:43.374
>> CANDIS: Any one of us could

40:43.374 --> 40:45.577
be in a situation where we could

40:45.577 --> 40:48.046
be just like our brothers and

40:48.046 --> 40:49.848
sisters who are murdered because

40:49.848 --> 40:51.983
you are trans.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.285
>> MISS LEON: We must remember

40:54.285 --> 40:56.254
that out of tragedy comes hope,

40:56.254 --> 40:58.557
resilience and triumph.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.492
I'm here to support, maintain

41:00.492 --> 41:01.727
and nurture this trans memorial

41:01.727 --> 41:03.695
garden, which, again, is the

41:03.695 --> 41:04.796
very first of its kind in the

41:04.796 --> 41:05.797
nation.

41:05.797 --> 41:06.898
We are making history right

41:06.898 --> 41:08.233
here, in The Grove, in St.

41:08.233 --> 41:09.535
Louis, in the Midwest.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.168
(cheering)

41:10.168 --> 41:11.537
Hey, yes!

41:11.537 --> 41:12.971
History is being made.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.173
>> KATE: Well, thank you, St.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.242
Louis, for putting this here.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.910
I want to acknowledge that we

41:18.910 --> 41:21.680
are the first generations who

41:21.680 --> 41:24.015
are actively bringing about the

41:24.015 --> 41:26.585
end of transphobia.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.586
(cheering, whooping)

41:27.586 --> 41:28.820
>> KATE: Thank you so much!

41:28.820 --> 41:29.821
>> MATT BEILIS: * 'Cause

41:29.821 --> 41:32.558
whatever we are, we are... *

41:32.558 --> 41:33.759
>> CAITLYN: Trans Day of

41:33.759 --> 41:35.293
Remembrance was actually a very

41:35.293 --> 41:36.695
beautiful experience.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.864
Having an opportunity to pay

41:38.864 --> 41:41.299
respect to these people for who

41:41.299 --> 41:43.301
they were, for me, is very

41:43.301 --> 41:44.570
important.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.738
And it's nice to kind of be

41:46.738 --> 41:48.907
reminded of what the issues are

41:48.907 --> 41:50.175
out there.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.777
>> SPEAKER: And we claim this

41:51.777 --> 41:55.246
space as living and sacred.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.748
>> BEILIS: * Whatever we are

41:56.748 --> 41:59.718
We are... *

42:08.026 --> 42:09.027
>> KRIS: Hi!

42:09.027 --> 42:10.028
>> CANDIS: Still to come this

42:10.028 --> 42:11.997
season on I Am Cait...

42:14.600 --> 42:17.769
>> CAITLYN: Candis!

42:17.769 --> 42:19.671
>> CANDIS: That's a big stick.

42:19.671 --> 42:20.672
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's told me

42:20.672 --> 42:21.707
that in a long time.

42:21.707 --> 42:22.908
(laughter, cheering)

42:22.908 --> 42:24.509
>> JENNY: That's what I'm

42:24.509 --> 42:25.611
talking about!

42:25.611 --> 42:27.445
>> ELLA: Kiss.

42:27.445 --> 42:28.614
(laughter)

42:28.614 --> 42:29.480
>> CAITLYN: Hand hug!

42:29.480 --> 42:30.481
>> SCOTT: How much are trees?

42:30.481 --> 42:32.150
$100? Aye, aye, aye.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.451
>> CANDIS: We have to talk about

42:33.451 --> 42:34.620
something.

42:34.620 --> 42:35.854
"Presidential hopeful Ted Cruz

42:35.854 --> 42:38.223
opposes equality for transgender

42:38.223 --> 42:39.625
people because he thinks trans

42:39.625 --> 42:41.359
kids will molest his daughters."

42:41.359 --> 42:42.628
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

42:42.628 --> 42:43.695
>> MARA: There is a partisan

42:43.695 --> 42:44.863
slant to this.

42:44.863 --> 42:46.364
Watch your candidates this year.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.667
When they do messed up stuff,

42:48.667 --> 42:49.735
you call them out.

42:49.735 --> 42:50.802
>> JENNY: Republicans, your

42:50.802 --> 42:52.403
people, they don't like us.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.404
>> CAITLYN: They're not my

42:53.404 --> 42:54.405
people if they're against this

42:54.405 --> 42:55.340
issue.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.207
I think he's just totally

42:56.207 --> 42:57.208
misinformed.

42:57.208 --> 43:00.511
>> CANDIS: That was a huge step.

43:00.511 --> 43:02.080
>> CAITLYN: You're absolutely

43:02.080 --> 43:03.214
right.

43:03.214 --> 43:04.382
I just want to apologize

43:04.382 --> 43:05.651
for the way I acted.

43:05.651 --> 43:07.085
It didn't he be that way.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.787
A little disobediance, girls?

43:08.787 --> 43:10.121
What do you say?

43:10.121 --> 43:11.256
>> KATE: Seriously, that could

43:11.256 --> 43:12.891
mean arrest.

43:12.891 --> 43:14.159
You're becoming a leftist

43:14.159 --> 43:15.694
activist.

43:15.694 --> 43:16.862
(cheering)

43:16.862 --> 43:18.664
You found out how to express

43:18.664 --> 43:22.300
yourself as a woman and listen,

43:22.300 --> 43:24.469
and for that, you've earned my

43:24.469 --> 43:28.273
respect and complete support.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.775
>> CAITLYN: I love you all.
