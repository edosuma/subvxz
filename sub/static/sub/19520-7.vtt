<i> "bates motel"...</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:04.470
- Alex?
- Hey, Maggie.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.205
- What are you doing here?

00:06.207 --> 00:06.205
-<i> May I come in?</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:08.273
<i> - I saw something online.</i>

00:08.275 --> 00:09.508
Your mom, she died.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.243
-<i> Why would you</i>
<i> keep this from me?</i>

00:11.245 --> 00:12.778
- I couldn't bring myself to

00:12.780 --> 00:14.246
<i> tell you the horrible truth,</i>

00:14.248 --> 00:16.548
<i> which is that</i>
<i> she committed suicide.</i>

00:16.550 --> 00:18.217
- Bullshit!

00:18.219 --> 00:19.485
All right, she wou--
she wouldn't do that.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.753
I need to go down there.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.121
<i> - Don't screw with me.</i>

00:22.123 --> 00:24.056
I'm perfectly willing
to kick your ass

00:24.058 --> 00:26.225
if you breathe a word
about this to my wife.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.227
I can't believe you.

00:28.229 --> 00:28.227
- I hate him.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.763
- He's bad, Norman,
like your father was.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.164
<i> You wanted to know the truth?</i>

00:32.165 --> 00:33.365
- Well, I don't want
to know it anymore--

00:33.367 --> 00:35.100
- you wanted to understand
who I am?

00:35.102 --> 00:36.435
-<i> Never mind--I'm sorry.</i>

00:36.437 --> 00:38.504
<i> - It's too late, Norman!</i>
<i> It is here!</i>

00:44.512 --> 00:47.079
<i> - Oh, mother,</i>

00:47.081 --> 00:49.448
what have I done?

01:29.155 --> 01:30.856
- Oh, Jesus, Norman,
turn the faucet off.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.491
You're wasting water.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.307
Come on, Norman.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.175
You want to play
with the big kids, honey?

01:50.177 --> 01:51.577
You gotta act like the big kids.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.178
Let's clean this up.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.880
Okay, change your clothes.
Do it over there.

01:54.882 --> 01:58.217
I'm not gonna look.
I'm gonna work on this.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.526
Honey.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.496
I know you're in shock,

02:10.497 --> 02:12.431
okay?

02:13.667 --> 02:16.168
big deal.
You'll live.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.337
You can think about
the meaning of life later,

02:18.339 --> 02:22.307
but right now,
we got shit to do.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.643
Okay?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.345
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.247
All right.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.515
Go change.

02:52.539 --> 02:56.675
- I just killed someone, mother.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.211
- Well, you wanted
to know, Norman.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.280
You kept asking questions.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.382
You can't do this to me.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.250
You can't be like,
"i don't believe in Santa claus"

03:05.252 --> 03:06.652
and then when I say,
"okay, honey, you're right,"

03:06.654 --> 03:08.387
you freak out.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.689
I mean, this--this is not fair.
You painted me in a corner.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.959
And now you have to
deal with it, okay?

03:13.961 --> 03:16.595
- I'm trying.

03:16.597 --> 03:20.566
It's just a lot.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.995
- turn off the headlights.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.466
- what are they doing, mother?

03:56.704 --> 03:57.703
- Mm.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.819
- This is gonna be a long night.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.305
Okay.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.774
- That was a body bag.
Mother, did you see it?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.609
- It doesn't necessarily
have anything to do with us--

05:10.611 --> 05:13.378
- that was Jim, mother.
It was Jim Blackwell.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.780
Who else is it
gonna be in that lake?

05:14.782 --> 05:17.382
- Norman, you cannot have
a meltdown.

05:17.384 --> 05:18.784
- Sheriff Greene
has already come around,

05:18.786 --> 05:19.851
asking about him once before.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.520
She already suspects us

05:21.522 --> 05:23.555
of having something to do
with his disappearance,

05:23.557 --> 05:25.424
and she is gonna
piece it all together and--

05:38.572 --> 05:41.640
I'm gonna pretend that
didn't just happen right now.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.677
W-we have to focus

05:45.679 --> 05:48.080
on getting rid of Sam's body,
step by step.

05:48.082 --> 05:49.481
We deal with the rest later.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.882
We can't use the lake this time,

05:50.884 --> 05:52.884
so we have to choose between
the cliff and the woods.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.553
- "This time"?

05:56.757 --> 06:00.592
How many times
have we done this, mother?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.762
How many bodies are
they gonna find in that lake?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.572
Norman,

06:13.574 --> 06:16.441
there is a lot at stake
right now.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.577
If they connect
these crimes to you,

06:18.579 --> 06:20.846
they are either going
to kill you

06:20.848 --> 06:23.448
or they are gonna put you
in a mental institution

06:23.450 --> 06:26.785
and they are gonna
feed you meds!

06:26.787 --> 06:29.855
Whichever it is, it's
gonna be the end of us.

06:36.530 --> 06:40.165
Let's just dump the body
in the woods.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.601
Okay, I mean, we still
have to get rid of the car;

06:42.603 --> 06:44.436
we have to
clean the crime scene.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.805
We--you don't have time
for this emotional bullshit.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.774
Come on!
Let's go.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.883
God.

06:57.885 --> 07:01.720
Man, can't see shit
in the snow.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.191
I know there's an
old well here somewhere.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.592
- How do you know these things?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.795
I have eyes in my head.

07:09.797 --> 07:10.896
- So do I, mother.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.564
It's not like
i make a mental note

07:12.566 --> 07:14.199
of good things
to drop bodies into.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.500
- Yeah, well, who's talking now?

07:15.502 --> 07:16.568
- That doesn't even make sense.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.470
- Sh--you know what I mean.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.873
It's good that one of us is
thinking about these things.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.712
God.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.448
He's so heavy.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.882
- Yeah, well, he's tall.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.918
Was tall.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.555
- All right.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.656
One,

07:37.658 --> 07:38.523
two,

07:38.525 --> 07:40.592
three!

07:49.536 --> 07:51.036
This doesn't seem real.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.806
I can't believe I did this.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.975
He didn't deserve to die.

07:59.213 --> 08:00.846
- Jesus, Norman.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.957
if I had a quarter,
I'd make a wish.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.894
we gotta
ditch the car now.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.277
Jesus.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.714
Walking in this cold
for five miles.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.649
- You can't control
the weather, mother.

08:37.650 --> 08:41.086
That's one thing you have
nothing to say about.

08:41.087 --> 08:44.656
- Your money's falling
out of your pocket.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.561
- Can't believe he gave us
all of this for the car.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.530
- What'd you think
a chop shop was?

08:51.532 --> 08:53.665
They chop up stolen cars
and they sell the parts.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.901
Of course they gave you money.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.736
- It's just...

08:57.738 --> 08:59.304
Chick didn't give me any money

08:59.306 --> 09:00.772
for the other car, that's all.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.275
That guy.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.878
You have a lot to learn, Norman.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.047
- I know, mother.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.916
I do.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.018
- now we just got to finish

09:13.020 --> 09:15.287
micro-cleaning the motel room.

09:15.289 --> 09:18.023
Hope I remember
where I put the luminol.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.660
what'd I do with it?

09:25.832 --> 09:27.666
- mother.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.900
- Yeah?

09:28.902 --> 09:32.037
- Should I just turn myself in?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.873
- How can you say that to me?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.075
- Mother, I don't want
to be taken away from you

09:37.077 --> 09:38.343
or killed or locked up,

09:38.345 --> 09:40.812
but what we are doing is wrong.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.782
- you know,
maybe I shouldn't have

09:43.784 --> 09:45.784
told you the truth
about how things work.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.786
Maybe--maybe
it's just too much.

09:50.891 --> 09:54.125
look, if you ever
feel overwhelmed,

09:54.127 --> 09:57.362
I could just...
You know, take over.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.964
I would be happy to do it.
- No.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.900
Mother, no, that is
not an option.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.803
Okay?
Never again.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.079
shit.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.381
I'll handle this.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.383
- Don't do anything
stupid, Norman.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.019
If you love me.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.928
- Oh. Hello.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.701
Yeah, I thought I heard someone.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.771
- Hope I didn't catch you
at a bad time.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.940
- Oh, no, no,
no trouble at all.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.074
No, today's linen day.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.410
I always change the beds
here once a week,

10:45.412 --> 10:47.846
whether they've
been used or not.

10:47.848 --> 10:51.049
- Well, I've just been down at
the little lake down the road.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.150
Do you know the one?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.887
- Uh--yeah.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.122
Yes, i--i do, I think so.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.158
Is--it's over, uh,
over that way, huh?

11:00.160 --> 11:03.161
Yes. Yes, i-i often send
the kayakers there

11:03.163 --> 11:05.797
during the summer months.

11:05.799 --> 11:10.068
- Well, we found multiple bodies
there last night.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.038
- dead bodies?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.206
- Yes.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.209
And one was Jim Blackwell's.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.150
- oh, well, i--i--i don't
know what to say, sheriff.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.053
That's--that's truly awful news.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.055
- yes, it is.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.896
I just thought you should know

11:37.898 --> 11:40.899
Jim Blackwell
won't be bothering you.

11:44.705 --> 11:48.006
still like to know why
he had your address.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.208
And what Alex romero

11:50.210 --> 11:52.077
might have to do with
any of this.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.946
- I--i--just--i can't imagine.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.020
- looks like someone
left here in a hurry.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.757
- oh.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.026
Yeah, that, that was a...

12:08.028 --> 12:09.160
An unruly guest.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.462
I--i guess

12:10.464 --> 12:12.063
raking the gravel is next up.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.200
- I thought you said you
hadn't had any guests?

12:15.202 --> 12:18.036
- Really, did...

12:18.038 --> 12:20.105
The--oh, linen, and the--
no, i--i mean,

12:20.107 --> 12:23.775
we haven't had any real guests
that we--

12:23.777 --> 12:25.944
I mean, we had someone,
some people that came by,

12:25.946 --> 12:27.312
but it was only
a couple of hours.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.147
It was a...
Yeah.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.515
It was a quick one, you know?

12:30.517 --> 12:31.950
I had no idea that's
what they were gonna do.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.953
They did pay for the full night,
sheriff, so.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.323
- I know you're not
like that, Norman.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.292
But when was this?

12:41.294 --> 12:42.961
- Uh, this?

12:42.963 --> 12:45.263
It was, uh,

12:45.265 --> 12:46.898
it was last night.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.269
- well, I hope they didn't
give you too much trouble.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.304
- Oh, no.
No, no, no.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.542
- all right, then, Norman,

12:57.544 --> 12:59.544
I'll let you get back
to your linen.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.845
- And the raking.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.914
- And the raking, yes.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.183
Take care, now.
- All righty, sheriff.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.219
- What are you looking for?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.553
- I just--i wanted some water.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.222
I thought there was
a--a glass in here somewhere.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.923
- I'll get you a glass of water.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.225
Get back in bed.

14:20.227 --> 14:23.461
You've hardly eaten
for three days.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.596
You feel hungry yet?

14:24.598 --> 14:25.930
- Yeah, actually, I am.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.332
- Okay.

14:36.942 --> 14:39.277
Okay, okay, slow down.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.312
There's more.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.484
- Did i--did I have anything
with me when I got here?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.554
It--everything is just
such a blur.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.623
- Nope.
No, just you.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.491
Well, and a big, infected wound.

14:53.493 --> 14:57.629
I got some antibiotics.
That's what you've been taking.

14:57.631 --> 15:00.031
- Thanks.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.966
I'm pretty sure
you saved my life.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.903
- That was my goal.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.509
- I know I had a gun with me.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.311
Where is it?

15:15.282 --> 15:18.516
- You must have dropped it.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.453
finish your food.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.589
I'll be back in a little bit
to clear it up.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.115
- what'd she say?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.650
What are you doing, Norman?

15:56.022 --> 15:58.556
- they found more than one body.

15:58.558 --> 15:58.556
Multiple bodies.

15:58.558 --> 16:02.060
- Well, we kind of knew
that was gonna happen.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.695
- But it's all connected to us.

16:03.697 --> 16:06.397
They're gonna investigate
and we'll be on the radar.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.700
They could even
search the house.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.402
And so,

16:11.404 --> 16:13.571
we have to get everything
out of here

16:13.573 --> 16:17.976
that could possibly
arouse suspicion.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.579
- okay.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.987
so what--what are we
gonna do with...

16:28.989 --> 16:32.423
Where we gonna put her?

16:32.425 --> 16:36.394
- A spot in the woods,
up the mountain pass.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.396
There'll be snow there,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.665
and there's that
beautiful little clearing

16:40.667 --> 16:42.467
by the abandoned cabin.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.002
We found it there once
when we were

16:44.004 --> 16:45.403
collecting foliage on an out--
- yeah, whatever.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.471
Let's just get it done.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.638
- Maybe you should go

16:47.640 --> 16:50.074
back down to the motel
for a while.

16:52.178 --> 16:55.113
Put up a new shower curtain
or something.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.752
- I see.

17:00.754 --> 17:03.121
Okay. Yeah.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.523
sure.

18:52.564 --> 18:55.299
- I'll be back for you
as soon as I can.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.734
I promise.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.173
I love you.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.225
- I'll, uh,
make us something to eat.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.760
- Okay.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.347
you've been living here
alone all this time?

21:23.349 --> 21:25.349
- Uh, yes.

21:25.351 --> 21:26.884
Yeah, I, uh, I get by.

21:26.886 --> 21:30.755
- Norman, you shou--
you should have called me.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.990
You shouldn't be
living here by yourself.

21:32.992 --> 21:37.028
- I--it's--it's okay.
The motel's still running.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.468
Oh, how's Emma?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.003
- Uh, she's good.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.005
- Yeah?

21:48.007 --> 21:50.775
- We, uh, we got married.

21:50.777 --> 21:54.979
And, um, and we have a baby.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.481
- You--a baby?

21:57.483 --> 22:00.051
- Yeah.
Yeah, a--a little girl.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.919
Katie.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.362
A girl.

22:22.974 --> 22:26.043
I'm so sorry.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.713
I'm so sorry that
i didn't call you.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.448
That I haven't
seen you for so long.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.084
It's just...

22:33.086 --> 22:34.452
You have no idea, Dylan.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.954
Every day is a small century.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.779
- are you still
seeing your doctor?

23:01.781 --> 23:04.081
- Hm?
My doctor?

23:04.083 --> 23:06.417
- Yeah, your therapist?

23:06.419 --> 23:09.453
- Oh. Dr. Edwards.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.088
No, not officially anymore.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.991
Although I did happen to
bump into him in the village

23:13.993 --> 23:17.461
just this week and,
you know, he's doing well.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.997
- Whe--when did you
stop seeing him?

23:21.134 --> 23:23.834
- after mother died.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.403
It was all too much.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.040
- Are you still taking the meds?

23:32.011 --> 23:33.778
- no, no, I...

23:33.780 --> 23:35.413
Haven't for a while
now, actually.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.515
I really don't think
that I need them.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.871
The only thing is that

24:00.873 --> 24:04.041
I do sometimes miss our mother.

24:06.913 --> 24:10.948
So very much, Dylan.
I can't even tell you.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.117
It's just not the same,

24:13.119 --> 24:14.919
and it never will be.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.565
- I don't think
you're well, Norman.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.503
I don't think you should be
living here alone.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.605
- Well, living anywhere else,

24:34.607 --> 24:38.108
any other way is not an option.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.251
- look, I'm gonna, uh,
I'm gonna stay here with you

24:47.253 --> 24:49.520
for a few days.

24:49.522 --> 24:52.189
Okay, and we're gonna
get this all figured out.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.031
- I, uh,

25:01.033 --> 25:02.500
I don't feel so good.

25:02.502 --> 25:05.102
I'm just gonna go upstairs
and lie down.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.005
But enjoy.
Make yourself at home.

26:05.697 --> 26:09.070
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

26:29.321 --> 26:32.289
I'm so sorry.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.359
I'm so sorry, Norma.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.598
Please forgive me.

27:07.258 --> 27:10.194
- looking for something?

27:12.297 --> 27:14.398
- Maggie, come on, where is it?
Where'd you put it?

27:14.400 --> 27:16.233
- I'm not giving it
to you, Alex.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.835
Don't do something stupid

27:17.837 --> 27:17.835
and get yourself killed.

27:17.837 --> 27:21.639
Because you have always been
one of the kindest people

27:21.641 --> 27:24.408
in my life, Alex romero.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.211
- D-don't get in the
middle of this.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.848
- You were the only person
i grew up with

27:30.850 --> 27:33.283
in this shitty town
who was decent.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.219
Why are you doing this?

27:35.221 --> 27:37.655
What happened?

27:37.657 --> 27:39.223
I know you.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.692
I know you live
by your own moral compass.

27:41.694 --> 27:45.295
I know there's
a reason you're here.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.238
something about Norma bates?

28:03.015 --> 28:06.417
did she kill herself?

28:06.419 --> 28:08.919
- No.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.688
- And you know who did kill her?

28:10.690 --> 28:13.157
Or you think you do?

28:16.128 --> 28:18.429
- I just--i need my damn gun,
so just make it show up

28:18.431 --> 28:20.698
by the time I'm strong enough
to leave here.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.995
- mother.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.968
What--why--how long
have you been here?

28:57.970 --> 29:01.205
- Only a little while, honey.

29:01.207 --> 29:05.275
Just wanted to check in
with you after everything.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.479
And we gotta talk about Dylan.

29:08.481 --> 29:11.381
- What about Dylan?

29:11.383 --> 29:12.950
- He can't be here.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.085
- What--he's not gonna stay.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.054
- Well, he's asking
a lot of questions,

29:17.056 --> 29:18.489
and you can't let him
know the answers.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.057
- I won't, mother.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.159
I would never do anything
to jeopardize us.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.061
- He's your brother.
I know you love him.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.395
But you can't let him in.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.030
- He's just visiting.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.365
- Norman, I'm sure
he's coming at it

29:28.367 --> 29:31.769
from a good place, but...

29:31.771 --> 29:33.504
Unfortunately,
he's just misguided.

29:33.506 --> 29:36.340
He's never really understood us.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.208
Don't get me wrong,
i love Dylan.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.411
We both love Dylan.
I mean, it's Dylan.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.213
But the reality is that we--

29:43.215 --> 29:45.482
we can't have him
in our lives anymore.

29:47.353 --> 29:51.388
That's the price we pay
for having what we have.

29:51.390 --> 29:54.992
It's just the two of us.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.128
- I understand, mother.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.497
'Kay.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.336
you just need to, like,

30:06.338 --> 30:09.106
cook a nice little dinner
for the two of you.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.108
You know, charm him.
Be happy.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.476
Convince him that you're fine.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.278
And then make him leave.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.280
- Okay.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.414
- Okay.

30:34.265 --> 30:35.432
- Dylan?

30:35.434 --> 30:36.600
- Yeah.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.068
Any luck?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.336
- We called
your brother's doctor

30:39.338 --> 30:41.338
to see if we could renew
the expired prescription,

30:41.340 --> 30:44.041
but unfortunately
we couldn't speak to him.

30:44.043 --> 30:47.277
Dr. Edwards went missing
just over a year ago.

30:47.279 --> 30:50.080
Apparently, he's presumed dead.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.322
- i--i guess my brother
was confused.

30:58.324 --> 31:01.225
You know, he--he said that
he saw him a few days ago,

31:01.227 --> 31:03.260
but that's why
he needs the meds.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.298
I'm--

31:08.300 --> 31:10.434
I'm worried that if he
doesn't get his meds soon,

31:10.436 --> 31:12.269
then something
very bad will happen.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.458
can I help you?

31:34.460 --> 31:35.492
- Hi.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.194
- Hi.
Who are you?

31:37.196 --> 31:39.263
- I'm Madeleine.
I'm a friend of Norman's.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.498
Who are you?

31:41.500 --> 31:44.368
- I'm--I'm--I'm Dylan.
I'm Norman's brother.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.371
- Oh.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.239
- You didn't know
that he had a brother.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.475
- No.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.542
Well, I'm just

31:52.544 --> 31:55.245
going in to see Norman.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.615
My husband's missing;
He never came home, and...

31:58.617 --> 32:00.584
I just really need
to talk to Norman.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.952
I think he might have seen him.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.590
- Your husband was here?

32:06.592 --> 32:07.958
- I don't know.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.660
I--he might have been.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.495
I just don't know
where else to go.

32:11.497 --> 32:12.462
I've been calling and--

32:12.464 --> 32:13.931
- look, I'm--I'm really sorry

32:13.933 --> 32:15.365
about your husband, okay?

32:15.367 --> 32:17.401
But Norman is in a really
fragile state right now,

32:17.403 --> 32:20.671
and i--i just--i don't--
i don't want him to get upset.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.273
Okay, so if--if you want,

32:23.275 --> 32:24.541
I can--i can tell him
that you called,

32:24.543 --> 32:26.977
and I'm sure he'll--
he'll call you back.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.278
- Wait, what--
what do you mean?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.513
What's wrong with Norman?

32:33.485 --> 32:36.186
- n-Norman has...

32:36.188 --> 32:37.955
Norman has mental issues.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.957
Okay, he--he's--he's not well.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.291
That's all I can really say.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.327
Look, i--i just--
i really need to

32:43.329 --> 32:44.995
try and get him
into a safe place

32:44.997 --> 32:47.631
and control his
environment, okay?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.967
- I'm so sorry, i--

32:49.969 --> 32:51.001
I had no idea.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.304
- look, why don't--
why don't you just give me

32:54.306 --> 32:55.739
your husband's name
and I can ask him myself

32:55.741 --> 32:59.009
if he's seen him and--
um, I'm sure he'll let you know.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.577
- Sam loomis.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.979
- Okay.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.137
- Norman?

33:30.275 --> 33:32.709
- yeah, I'm just, uh,
just in the kitchen, Dylan.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.211
Putting out dinner.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.213
Everything okay?

34:01.440 --> 34:04.141
- pretty much done.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.379
- what's wrong?

34:09.380 --> 34:10.781
- We need to talk.

34:10.783 --> 34:15.385
I just ran into
someone named Madeleine.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.755
- I see. You, uh,

34:19.757 --> 34:21.190
you did, huh?

34:22.194 --> 34:25.062
- she was looking for
her husband?

34:27.498 --> 34:30.199
- hm, yes, the--the loomises.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.270
I've spent some time
with them both.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.072
I mean,

34:35.074 --> 34:36.339
I don't know them that well.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.175
And I certainly don't know
where he is.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.842
W-why don't you just sit on down

34:39.844 --> 34:41.478
and--and then we can eat, okay?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.525
- mm.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.603
- do you know what
happened to him, Norman?

35:11.143 --> 35:12.175
- No.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.244
No, of course
i don't know, Dylan.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.113
Come on--can we just
talk about this after--

35:16.115 --> 35:18.882
- no, we cannot
talk about this after.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.418
Okay, we're gonna
talk about this right now.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.121
Madeleine said that
she thought that

35:24.123 --> 35:25.388
he might have
come here yesterday.

35:25.390 --> 35:26.857
Did he come here yesterday?

35:31.830 --> 35:34.498
- mm-hmm.
Yes, he did.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.368
Dylan, he--he happened
to be here yesterday.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.870
- And what happened?

35:39.872 --> 35:41.905
- Well, you--

35:41.907 --> 35:45.575
y-y-you--you see the problem is,
Dylan, is that

35:45.577 --> 35:50.213
he was...
Not a very nice man.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.483
and he came here because

35:53.485 --> 35:56.386
he was cheating on Madeleine
with this other woman,

35:56.388 --> 35:58.155
and she rented a room.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.824
You know, just--
just so they could, uh,

36:00.826 --> 36:03.627
you know, spend
a few hours together.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.497
- and then what happened?
- I don't know.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.866
In--in the morning,
they just weren't here.

36:09.868 --> 36:12.169
All right, they--
they must have just

36:12.171 --> 36:13.637
left together in
the middle of the night.

36:13.639 --> 36:16.173
I mean....

36:16.175 --> 36:17.574
Took the car, you know,

36:17.576 --> 36:19.209
it's the sort of thing
that happens, isn't it?

36:19.211 --> 36:20.510
It does make sense
that he would not

36:20.512 --> 36:22.445
be calling his wife today.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.281
- And--and you don't know
where they went?

36:24.283 --> 36:25.916
- No, no, of course
i don't know, Dylan.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.285
I don't know anything more
than what I've just told you.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.320
So please stop trying
to confuse me

36:30.322 --> 36:33.623
and you stop meddling with
the truth.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.630
okay, I know you care
about me, Dylan...

36:43.602 --> 36:45.335
but you can't ever understand.

36:45.337 --> 36:48.705
So please, please
just leave me be,

36:48.707 --> 36:51.942
and let me live
how I need to live.

36:51.944 --> 36:53.543
Okay, you can't
even be here, okay?

36:53.545 --> 36:57.347
So i--i think that you
really should leave soon.

37:21.306 --> 37:25.342
- I just really want
to help you get better.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.744
Okay, you need
to trust me, please?

37:38.389 --> 37:41.258
i-i got the pharmacy
to give me a few pills,

37:41.260 --> 37:43.293
until we can get you
a new prescription.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.464
we need to get you some help.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.700
And you need to start
taking these again.

37:50.702 --> 37:54.304
You were doing
really well on them.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.374
please just take one
in front of me

37:57.376 --> 37:59.743
so I know you're taking it.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.563
- Please stay out of this,
mother.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.005
I just want to
talk to him, Norman.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.550
Dylan.

39:19.423 --> 39:22.492
Dylan, I know you mean well.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.700
Because you have
always meant well.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.705
And you may not believe me,

39:35.707 --> 39:38.641
but I am so proud of you.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.679
I love you.

39:46.751 --> 39:48.518
But unfortunately,

39:48.520 --> 39:52.856
I can only ever be
a real mother to one person.

39:52.858 --> 39:56.092
And so even though

39:56.094 --> 39:59.796
I love you so very much,

39:59.798 --> 40:01.798
and this pains me...

40:05.102 --> 40:06.503
You're getting in the way.

40:09.808 --> 40:10.840
Mother! No!

40:13.678 --> 40:15.412
Not him!

40:15.414 --> 40:16.813
- Norman, let go!

40:17.816 --> 40:19.816
let go!

40:23.755 --> 40:24.788
Norman.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.825
Stop it, mother!

40:31.763 --> 40:33.463
- Get off!

40:33.465 --> 40:35.198
Mother!

41:01.460 --> 41:03.793
<i> - 911. What's your emergency?</i>

41:03.795 --> 41:07.464
- I'd like to report a murder.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.899
My name is Norman bates.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.502
And I killed Sam loomis.

41:13.305 --> 41:19.408
