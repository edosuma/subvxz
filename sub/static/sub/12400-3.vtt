a Secret Service supervisor,

to the samples already on ﬁle.

throughout the government

18:07.211 --> 18:10.499
I guarantee you he is a bigger
part of the Shop's plan.

They wouldn't double him just
to plant some intel on Alex.

you're not an imposter,

25:32.489 --> 25:34.775
I'm going to share
all my intel with you.

25:36.410 --> 25:37.866
Uh, Nikki

25:38.412 --> 25:40.073
ask him
how he takes his coffee.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.495
Just trust me.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.455
How do you take your coffee?

25:46.086 --> 25:48.543
Milk and cream.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.207
But not Half & Half.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.211
SO Half & Half.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.543
Separate cream
and separate milk.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.131
The dairy solids react
differently.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.222
So you get a richer flavor.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.061
Separate cream,
separate milk.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.843
The dairy solids react
differently.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.804
So you get a richer flavor.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.601
What is it?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.474
Listen to how he's pausing.

26:11.487 --> 26:12.442
I don't think it's Amanda.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.436
She's got my real father
coaching him.

26:14.782 --> 26:15.942
Confirm it.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.448
Make the questions
more personal.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.279
All right, Nikki--

26:24.958 --> 26:26.994
You have a wife?

26:27.336 --> 26:29.452
Late wife, Rosemarie.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.369
Kids?

26:31.840 --> 26:34.707
Lilly and Lyle are grown

26:35.177 --> 26:37.634
and a third child
who passed away.

26:38.013 --> 26:38.843
Name?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.180
His name was Lionel.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.060
Lionel.

26:44.186 --> 26:45.847
Ask him how he died.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.103
How did he die?

26:48.690 --> 26:50.305
Sailing accident.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.353
They found the boat

26:52.528 --> 26:54.189
ﬂoaﬂng

26:54.363 --> 26:56.399
empty.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.314
Nothing on it except a

27:00.202 --> 27:02.318
dead tarantula.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.371
All they found was
a dead spider.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.120
That's it.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.208
He's on the other side.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.495
Only my father
would know that.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.373
Congratulations.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.840
You passed the test.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.804
What happens next?

27:22.975 --> 27:25.136
You are gonna help me find
the real imposters

27:25.269 --> 27:26.509
inside the NSA.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.352
See?
They don't know what he is.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.724
Or so it seems.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.062
Haven't you been listening?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.314
They're going to release him.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.149
Best-case scenario

27:38.240 --> 27:40.276
he tells us exactly
where they are.

27:40.450 --> 27:44.159
Worst-case, we find out
everything they know.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.702
What about this place?

27:48.917 --> 27:49.906
Egress is good.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.495
Not isolated enough.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.410
Sonya narrowed down the signal
from the consulate.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.128
She said it'd be
in this neighborhood.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.335
You sure are eager
to find Alex.

27:57.718 --> 27:58.707
Aren't you?

27:58.844 --> 28:00.675
Of course,
but you walked away.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.507
I still don't get why.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.426
It was an impulse.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.508
Sort of like when Nikita
took off on you.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.602
- All set.
- All right.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.274
Let's just go through
this again.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.728
You sit him down, you do
a fake search on the NSA server

28:16.069 --> 28:18.276
- act like you found the double.
- I thank him

28:18.405 --> 28:20.066
I give him this,
send him on his way.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.105
As soon as he uploads
this bad boy to Amanda

28:22.242 --> 28:23.527
it will ping us
with her location.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.404
We go save your real dad.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.290
Hang on.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.535
Amanda had your dad
coaching him, right?

28:35.714 --> 28:36.794
Yeah. So?

28:36.882 --> 28:38.122
So she'll put him
in the server

28:38.258 --> 28:40.340
when you're hacking,
just to monitor you.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.465
I mean, your dad's probably
the one

28:41.595 --> 28:44.007
who beat you during
the DNA hack.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.257
What's your point?

28:47.517 --> 28:48.643
Send him a message.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.968
Something embedded, something
only your dad can read.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.189
Why would I do that?

28:54.983 --> 28:56.484
So you can talk to him.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.814
Nah, I think
that's too risky.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.149
Nerd.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.072
he could give us
his exact location.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.192
And even if he can't,
we'd have a mole on the inside.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.535
- No.
- Amanda won't kill him

29:08.664 --> 29:09.995
- if he's not comp--
- No.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.742
You're that afraid,
are you?

29:14.878 --> 29:16.334
Afraid?

29:16.463 --> 29:18.499
Afraid of what?
I'm not afraid.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.040
- "Afraid."
- You are his son.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.334
Talk to him.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.020
Come on, Nerd.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.727
What Easter egg
is he going to use?

29:37.985 --> 29:40.818
The name of that tarantula
he left on the sailboat.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.694
It was his favorite pet.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.025
But when his grades started
to suffer,

29:45.158 --> 29:47.695
his dad thought it was
a distraction, so he killed it.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.492
Birkhoff made it seem
like he got drunk

29:49.663 --> 29:52.370
and was gonna bury it at sea.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.332
Nikita: Pop sounds like
a piece of work.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.212
This is the same monkey
from the coroner's office.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.751
That's him.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.381
You said you knew this guy?

30:48.805 --> 30:50.420
Does it matter?

30:50.599 --> 30:52.681
I recognize a few things.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.966
His name is
Seymour Birkhoff.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.480
You might know him
as the Shadowalker.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.016
He's on the Agency's list.

30:59.149 --> 31:00.855
I don't doubt it.
He's had his moments.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.270
He designed
a very useful program.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.359
Yeah.
Shadownet.

31:05.489 --> 31:06.399
That's right.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.938
Can I see a picture of him?

31:22.798 --> 31:24.208
What you expected?

31:27.302 --> 31:28.542
No.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.016
What do you got?

32:02.504 --> 32:04.210
Time for your transfer,
Alex.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.289
Unless you've changed
your mind.

32:11.847 --> 32:15.180
You're not just doing this
because of the assassination.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.057
Something's coming,
and you think I know about it.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.468
I already told you.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.853
I am not gonna share
unless you do.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.599
Who am I gonna tell?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.984
I'm just a trust-fund baby.

32:36.538 --> 32:39.746
We've been monitoring chatter
by Pakistani intelligence.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.698
We believe an operation
is in the works,

32:41.877 --> 32:44.584
but we haven't been able
to pinpoint exactly where.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.796
The Pakistani man.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.757
That must be what
they're gonna use him for.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.383
They're going to put him
somewhere

32:52.512 --> 32:53.968
- in Pakistani intelligence--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.212
What Pakistani man?

32:55.724 --> 32:57.214
I found four of them
on the docks.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.053
Same place I found that.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.476
They're gonna
surgically alter his face

33:02.731 --> 33:04.221
turn him into one
of their imposters.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.434
Go time.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.359
I'll meet you outside.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.562
(DOOR OPENS)

33:13.158 --> 33:14.898
(STREET NOISE)

33:25.170 --> 33:26.751
Unh! Unh!

33:33.428 --> 33:34.588
Unh!

33:34.679 --> 33:35.885
Freeze!

33:50.946 --> 33:52.152
Hands!

34:00.205 --> 34:02.287
Not bad
for a trust-fund baby.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.206
Not bad
for an accountant.

34:10.924 --> 34:12.460
Sorry we're late.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.503
You look surprised.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.799
lam.

34:20.350 --> 34:21.760
What is taking so long?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.800
Hold on.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.279
(TYPING)

34:50.630 --> 34:51.460
Birkhoff: Boom!

34:51.590 --> 34:53.581
- We got our double.
- What?

34:53.758 --> 34:55.009
Here we go.
Give him the bait.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.837
- Let's go get Amanda.
- Birkhoff: Sheryl Stein.

34:56.970 --> 34:59.006
It says right here she was promoted
just after the 620.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.675
President Spencer
must have known about that.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.141
So?

35:03.768 --> 35:06.020
It'll all make sense
once you read this.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.512
It's everything we know
about the Shop.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.938
- Peller (Imposter): The Shop?
- Birkhoff: You'll see.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.233
Come on.
Let's go.

35:17.782 --> 35:18.646
Fletcher: He did it.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.029
We did it.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.836
Amanda: That flash drive
will be useful.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.832
Everything we need
to tear them apart.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.885
Why did you do it, Lionel?

35:44.559 --> 35:45.594
What did you say?

35:49.564 --> 35:53.728
You asked for his picture.
Why did you ask for--

35:57.072 --> 35:59.905
You had a third child
who passed away.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.657
Sailboat accident.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.028
Lionel.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.323
Execute fail-safe

36:09.751 --> 36:10.866
Now!

36:16.758 --> 36:18.089
Don't move!

36:25.266 --> 36:26.016
Unh!

36:26.017 --> 36:27.427
You don't have to do this.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.683
If anything happens to you,
Amanda kills my—-

36:37.445 --> 36:39.276
(GUNSHOT)

36:39.781 --> 36:41.362
(PIPE DROPS)

37:09.602 --> 37:10.853
I think that's everything.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.640
Yep.
That should be helpful.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.309
You came back for me.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.812
Yeah, well, I sort of
ran out on you first.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.526
Yeah, Michael told me.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.904
He would do that.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.027
Look, we're a team.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.991
We can't work together
if we can't trust each other.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.168
Yeah.
No, I hear you.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.968
- Thank you.
- Alex.

37:45.847 --> 37:46.882
It's Ryan.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.722
Thanks for your help.

37:56.024 --> 37:59.141
I guess having me back
wasn't such a bad thing, huh?

38:01.362 --> 38:02.738
Guess not.

38:03.490 --> 38:06.357
Yeah, I've run the stats
on the Pakistani man you found.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.115
Height, build, blood type.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.326
He doesn't match up
with any high-ranking officials

38:10.455 --> 38:12.867
- in Pakistani intelligence.
- Alex: Keep looking.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.036
I'm telling you, they've got
something big planned for him.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.538
They'll never see him coming.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.499
It will be trickier
without Peller

38:20.632 --> 38:22.372
but we'll make it work.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.710
It had to be done.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.716
You wasted a valuable asset.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.798
We can't see this through
as designed

38:27.889 --> 38:29.129
without Peller in place.

38:29.224 --> 38:32.216
We have the Stuxworm.
We can improvise.

38:32.393 --> 38:33.894
Oh, IWiII.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.518
Despite your posturing

38:35.647 --> 38:38.639
you clearly don't have
the wits to defeat Nikita.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.725
You were played, Amanda.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.269
We do this my way.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.839
He was a son of a bitch

39:12.517 --> 39:14.849
but he didn't deserve this.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.141
I know what you're feeling.

39:19.315 --> 39:22.022
I just don't know
how to make it better for you.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.561
Well, at least
I got to talk to him.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.780
If you hadn't pushed me
to send that message

39:30.243 --> 39:32.700
I never would've had
the chance.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.618
I wanted to keep my promise.

39:37.792 --> 39:40.124
I'm so sorry.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.753
You want to promise me
something?

39:44.883 --> 39:47.465
Promise me you'll take
your own advice.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.877
Stop running.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.505
What you run from
you run into.

40:02.317 --> 40:05.104
You never cease
to amaze me, Nerd.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.780
This is not over.

40:33.181 --> 40:36.423
For years, I tried
to discover his secret.

40:36.893 --> 40:40.260
All those sessions--
I could never crack him.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.347
You don't know anything
about him.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.192
But you do.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.480
The secret is
somewhere inside

40:48.571 --> 40:52.905
that decrepit little psyche
of his.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.529
A valuable password

40:56.663 --> 40:59.996
to an absolutely
invaluable system.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.995
The only system
that could ever bring us down.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.413
You'll never crack
Shadownet.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.798
Not without him.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.542
Yes.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.753
Lionel may be out of reach

41:12.011 --> 41:14.388
but the building blocks

41:14.555 --> 41:17.046
of his personality are

41:17.517 --> 41:20.475
right here, aren't they?

41:21.562 --> 41:24.144
You know, back when
he worked for me

41:24.732 --> 41:28.099
I wanted to use more extreme
measures on your son.

41:28.277 --> 41:32.020
But my boss at the time--
He wouldn't allow it.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.448
Well, guess what.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.279
I'm my own boss now.
