Let's talk.

13:46.117 --> 13:52.705
I went back to the house to change
clothes and I found this in the mess.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.711
The way this reads,
you've been talking

14:04.844 --> 14:06.755
to Rebecca for
months about joining CTU.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.836
(ERIC SIGHS)

14:08.765 --> 14:10.426
To be honest,
it was just something

14:10.600 --> 14:12.182
I was considering.
I'm not even...

14:12.268 --> 14:13.303

14:13.394 --> 14:15.431
Not even sure I wanted it.

(SIGHS)

14:19.942 --> 14:21.603
Eric, this morning,
when you asked me

14:21.736 --> 14:23.352
why I started
taking birth control,

14:23.446 --> 14:25.528
and I said I thought
you still needed more time,

14:25.615 --> 14:27.151
do you remember
what you said to me?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.322
Yeah.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.277
But that was a lie, wasn't it?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.451
Baby, you're not happy.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.660
Nicole...

14:36.793 --> 14:37.908
You need this.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.202
You always will.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.754
No. Listen,
even if that was true,

14:45.134 --> 14:48.752
it doesn't mean I don't need
you, baby, because I do.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.721
I do.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.510
Then why did you
keep this from me?

15:00.817 --> 15:01.978
I was just...

15:02.193 --> 15:04.025
I was trying to find
the right time to tell you.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.819
I was, Nicole.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.115
(SIGHS) I'm not
here to put you

15:11.244 --> 15:13.576

think this is important.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.904
It's not about today
and what you had to do,

15:15.998 --> 15:16.954

that I speak with Eric.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.883
It's all right.

15:31.013 --> 15:34.381
Um, I'm sorry to hear about what
you're going through, Rebeooa.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.180
Thank you.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.434
Eric.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.195
Jadalla contacted me.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.907
When?
Just now.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.419
He said that if I give myself
up to him, he'll release John.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.955
Okay. What does Mullins think?

16:07.049 --> 16:08.005
I didn't tell him.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.708
What?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.839
Look, I can't take the chance
that he will say no.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.005
I know that I would if
I were in his position.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.596
Rebecca, you're not
seriously considering this?

16:18.728 --> 16:21.516
Jadalla says that if I don't,
he will kill John.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.267
So this at least
gives him a chance.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.145
Rebecca, I know
you want your husband back.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.475
I get it.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.028
I was willing to give up
everything to save Nicole, okay?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.855
But I went in
there to get that list.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.314
Iwasn'tjust
giving up my life.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.774

16:35.578 --> 16:36.864
Jadalla and Naseri,

16:38.789 --> 16:41.201
they want to
stage my execution.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.075
They wanna show the world
that they can defeat

16:44.170 --> 16:46.582
the woman who
tried to destroy them.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.332
They're gonna want
to kill me themselves.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.089
You wanna use
yourself as bait?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.591
And I want you to
finish them off.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.182
Find somewhere that they can't
see you and take them out.

17:01.062 --> 17:04.271
This is our chance
to finish what we started.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.525
All right.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.362
I'm in.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.951
Can you get me
into the CTU armory?

17:19.622 --> 17:22.284
Yeah, I think so. I still
have provisional status.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.328
Good.

But let me ask you something,
Senator.

How does it feel to be
married to a monster, huh?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.405

monsters in this world

18:04.542 --> 18:06.078
are the ones who
kill Americans.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.038
No.

18:08.838 --> 18:13.002
No, those who, for whatever their
reasons, murder innocent people.

18:14.302 --> 18:17.135
On that score,
your wife is second to none.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.013
And you're a liar.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.597
I wonder if you really don't
know what I'm talking about.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.890
I'd tell you to
ask her, but...

18:33.112 --> 18:34.318

see her again.

maybe this wouldn't
have happened to you.

I thought I was
joining a better world.

had murdered you, I...

19:38.552 --> 19:41.590
I couldn't rationalize
their hypocrisy anymore.

That is why you had to make
your own journey.

we had two-way GPS tracking devices

Uh, Rebecca isn't
doing this alone.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.110
She enlisted a former
Army Ranger to help her.

28:22.618 --> 28:23.779

28:23.869 --> 28:24.904

28:24.995 --> 28:27.783
Rebecca's planning to do more than
trade herself for her husband.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.369
Are you suggesting we let
her go through with this?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.249

we think this through

28:32.377 --> 28:34.038

which I think...

28:34.213 --> 28:36.045
Director Mullins.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.543
Senator Donovan's kidnapping
was a blow to this country.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.624
But if the terrorists
get their hands on

28:40.802 --> 28:42.258

there are things...

28:42.346 --> 28:44.462
We've already revoked Miss
lngram's provisional status.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.589
And we're updating security
passwords and codes

28:46.683 --> 28:48.173

been exposed to today.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.051

28:50.145 --> 28:51.385
