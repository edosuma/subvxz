WEBVTT

01:39.560 --> 01:41.600
Charlie, start it again.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.760
All right, here we go.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.320
# Just like the... #

01:44.320 --> 01:47.040
Wait a minute, wait.
Aah. Got it?

01:47.040 --> 01:50.280
# Just like the rose, dear

01:50.280 --> 01:53.120
# That's used to the sun

01:53.120 --> 01:55.480
# The petals close, dear

01:55.480 --> 01:58.760
# When summer is done

01:58.760 --> 02:00.600
# And I'm so used to your kisses

02:00.600 --> 02:03.560
# It doesn't seem strange

02:03.560 --> 02:05.320
# Used to your loving

02:05.320 --> 02:09.320
# And I don't want to, don't want to,
don't want to, don't want to... #

02:10.680 --> 02:12.840
Well, we ran out of time
on the record

02:12.840 --> 02:15.360
so it just keeps repeating,
"Don't want to."

02:15.360 --> 02:18.880
It was one of those
booths in the arcade.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.560
Can't imagine how excited we kids
were, getting a record in the mail

02:22.560 --> 02:24.760
from Atlantic City recorded
by Mom and Dad!

02:24.760 --> 02:27.480
It's just a little family joke,
no reason you should get it.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.440
It's kind of funny.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.840
Have you still got the record?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.200
Somewhere.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.280
I think I'll go get a cigarette.
Care to join me?

02:34.280 --> 02:35.560
He quit, Dad.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.960
Oh.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.720
Hey, good for you.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.480
I quit too, it was right
after Gary here was born.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.240
And after Joan was born
and Roger and Sam and Tommy.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.480
Will ya?

02:46.480 --> 02:49.080
After all, I like smoking too.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.200
I could use some air.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.960
OK, follow me.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.000
Shirley.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.720
Hello, Doc.
How are you, you son of a gun?

02:58.720 --> 03:02.240
Doc Bogart, I want you
to meet Bob Caldwell.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.440
He is a real doctor.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.920
What kind of medicine you in?

03:04.920 --> 03:06.040
Plastic surgeon.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.720
Do me a favour.
Stop by my table later,

03:08.720 --> 03:11.600
give me an estimate on my wife!

03:11.600 --> 03:13.880
Listen, you don't drink
too much, Doc.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.720
You got a long drive home.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.880
He's a great guy.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.880
We raced together in the nationals,
1941, '42 and '43.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.000
How long you been involved
in rowing, Mr Hilary?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.840
Charlie, Charlie, how many times
do I have to tell you?

03:29.840 --> 03:30.880
Right.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.880
Let's see. I started in high school,
that was 1940.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.080
Then after the War I began coaching.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.040
Wonderful sport, rowing.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.960
Let me tell you.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.960
You're in a shell,
eight guys and a cox seat.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.560
Each oar has to hit
at exactly the right moment

03:54.560 --> 03:57.800
without disturbing the water,
then you pull,

03:57.800 --> 04:01.800
you feel the tension
roll through every muscle.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.720
You try to push
the water away from you.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.720
After a time, the rhythm clicks
and it's as if you were one body,

04:12.160 --> 04:14.800
driving across the river.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.800
I tell you, there's
nothing like it in the whole world.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.240
Except making love.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.160
What's your sport?

04:24.160 --> 04:26.560
Played a little football in college.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.480
The only things you get from
contact sports are broken bones

04:29.480 --> 04:32.840
and Astroturf in your face.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.760
I didn't like you very much
when I met you in November,

04:35.760 --> 04:38.920
but now, you're OK.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.160
Thanks, Charlie.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.440
Especially since you cut off
that ridiculous moustache.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.480
They're ready for you, Dad.

04:47.480 --> 04:51.480
Oh, OK.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.880
APPLAUSE

05:01.880 --> 05:04.200
Little drumroll, please.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.600
DRUMROLL

05:05.600 --> 05:09.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends of the rowing club, welcome.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.480
As many of you already know,

05:11.480 --> 05:15.480
we feel that this season we have
the greatest eight since 1956.

05:16.760 --> 05:20.760
We think our boys have a real shot
at the Olympic trials this spring.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.720
Of course, I have said that
every four years since 1956

05:24.720 --> 05:28.720
but I particularly want to invite
you back down here on April 30th

05:29.680 --> 05:33.680
for the official christening
of our brand new rowing shell,

05:34.800 --> 05:38.320
which is going to carry us
from Princeton to Los Angeles

05:38.320 --> 05:40.760
and to the gold.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.280
APPLAUSE

05:43.280 --> 05:46.680
Be sure and bring your picnic
baskets and your cheque books.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.000
Thank you all very much.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
APPLAUSE

05:55.760 --> 05:58.240
May I please have this dance?

05:58.240 --> 06:02.240
Yes, you may.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.560
I do.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.400
And do you, Roberta Drexel Sloan,
take this man, Victor,

06:15.400 --> 06:16.520
to be your husband?

06:16.520 --> 06:18.040
I do.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.560
I don't.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.960
I know that I've never been married

06:22.960 --> 06:26.960
but isn't the bride supposed to say
the do before the groom does?

06:28.560 --> 06:30.720
I was right. It's genetic.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.240
No, it's too much Chardonnay.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.840
I mean, correct me
if I'm wrong here, please.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.840
I can't remember... Judith.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.280
It's fine just the way it is,
Aunt Cherie. It's just fine.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.240
Oh, OK then, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.920
I won't say another word.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.520
My little pretty!

06:52.520 --> 06:56.040
You are so lucky.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.040
Will all of you witnessing these
promises do all in your power

07:00.120 --> 07:02.680
to uphold these two persons
in their marriage?

07:02.680 --> 07:05.360
That's it, man, I can't hold it
any longer. I got to whizz.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.000
Dogger, we're almost done.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.400
Hey, man, I'm into nature, OK?

07:09.400 --> 07:13.240
Nature calls, I answer.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.600
Second door on your left.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.560
That's OK, man,
I like to go outside.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.600
I guess that's why they call
him Dogger.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.000
Then I say by the powers
invested in me and so forth

07:24.000 --> 07:27.680
and then you two kiss.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.920
Let's eat.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.360
Fine.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.800
Will everyone please
step into the dining room?

07:32.800 --> 07:36.800
What a lovely, lovely
house you have, Mrs Craig.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.920
Oh, you got to see this, man.
You got to see this!

07:39.920 --> 07:43.000
Cut it out, for Pete's sake,
you haven't even washed your hands.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.560
Seriously, man, you got to see this.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.600
All right, all right.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.240
It's right outside round the corner.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.120
OK, you two. Break.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.760
Mrs Craig, have I thanked you for
letting us have the wedding here?

07:53.760 --> 07:56.000
Three times every day
for the past week.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.360
Did Roberta thank you?

07:57.360 --> 07:59.600
You two better go and eat.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.440
Helen, he wrote his name
in the snow.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.760
So what?

08:05.760 --> 08:07.000
Not with his finger.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.320
Script or print?

08:08.320 --> 08:09.480
Print.

08:09.480 --> 08:13.480
This I got to see.

08:17.520 --> 08:21.160
You also never told me
that your father almost went
to the Olympics either.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.600
Best crew he's ever coached.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.880
Caught a crab at the
'56 trials in Syracuse.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.840
Caught a crab?

08:29.840 --> 08:32.200
When one of the oars
gets stuck in the water

08:32.200 --> 08:34.559
and the whole shell
pitches to one side.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.559
Once the boat loses momentum it's
impossible to get it back in sync.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.880
I was six but I can still see
the disappointment on his face.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.560
Mom says Dad's been vomiting
for the past two days,

08:48.560 --> 08:50.640
she can't get him to go to a doctor.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.440
He looks fine to me.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.480
Seen guys our age
with half his energy.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.040
I know.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.280
Don't worry about it.
Could be a million minor things.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.880
Yeah.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.880
Just gets you thinking, you know?

09:07.880 --> 09:11.600
I remember one day after school
I was sitting in my dad's chair

09:11.600 --> 09:14.320
watching the Mike Douglas Show
or something.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.320
He came in carrying sales books and a
case of wine his company was selling.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.760
He looked so tired.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.360
No, bored.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.240
So?

09:30.240 --> 09:32.720
That was the day I realised.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.440
My dad's nothing special.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.880
He's just an ordinary man
who sells wine to liquor stores.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.120
What's wrong with that?

09:41.120 --> 09:44.160
He's played the game exactly
the way he's supposed to.

09:44.160 --> 09:48.040
Married out of high school,
five kids in ten years.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.040
He spent the last 39 years in a job
that never brought him any joy.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.360
Joan, folks who grew
up in the depression,

09:55.360 --> 09:58.600
they didn't have the same
options we have now.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.640
Once we were all out of the house, he
could have done whatever he wanted.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.720
Did you ever talk to him about it?

10:03.720 --> 10:06.280
Several times.
There's always a reason.

10:06.280 --> 10:10.280
A new roof, a new furnace.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.720
I love you.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.720
Even though I'm just
an ordinary guy.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.640
Remember, Phil, prenuptial
festivities start at noon.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.240
The "I dos" kick off at one.

10:29.240 --> 10:29.840
OK.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.520
OK.

10:31.520 --> 10:35.520
Yeah. I figure 26.2 at
seven-and-a-half a mile -
should be about three hours.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.360
So if you start by nine, you should
have time to get back and shower.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.040
Mm-hm. See you tomorrow.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.520
Mm-hm. See you tomorrow.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.560
I'm running the Boston Marathon.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.320
In February?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.160
Oh, Phil, I don't know
how to break this,

10:47.160 --> 10:48.800
but the Boston Marathon
is in April.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.080
I know. You see, last year,
I didn't finish.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.760
I didn't have the stamina.
This time, I'm going to be ready.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.160
I'm going to run the exact
route of the marathon

10:56.160 --> 10:57.440
and I'm going to finish.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.920
and I'm going to finish.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.040
So. How come you're not going
to the wedding?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.120
The head nurse has just
let me back down here,

11:06.120 --> 11:08.800
so I am in no position
to juggle my schedule.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.080
Did Ehrlich really invite you?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.720
Did Ehrlich really invite you?

11:11.720 --> 11:15.720
Must be a big wedding.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.560
Please, help me!
He's all feverish.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.280
Get a gurney. Let's put him in 2.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.200
Lie down here.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.840
Marie...

11:26.840 --> 11:30.840
Don't you worry about a thing,
Charlie.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.760
(EXHALES LOUDLY)

12:02.120 --> 12:03.800
STARTER'S GUN FIRES

12:03.800 --> 12:07.800
CROWD CHEERS

12:23.720 --> 12:27.720
(SLOWLY) I do. I do.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.280
(FIRMLY) I do.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.800
(UNCERTAINLY) I do.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.680
I've checked on Roberta. She's
in our bedroom getting dressed.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.760
How she do...doing?
How is she doing?

12:36.760 --> 12:39.960
Well, she's a little nervous.
But don't worry about it.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.320
Huh. Don't worry.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.120
I do worry.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.440
No, no, no. I'm not going to worry.
Excuse me.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.120
Not today, not today.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.480
Do not worry.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.200
I do.
Boy, I could use a drink.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.240
How about a margarita, man?

12:53.240 --> 12:55.760
Ha! No, thanks,
I've got keep my head straight.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.280
I'll hold the show.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.720
I'll hold the show.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.120
Whoa, part-ay!

13:01.120 --> 13:04.640
(LAUGHS)

13:04.640 --> 13:07.720
Here you go, man.
Whoa, Victor, Victor.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.720
May the saddest days of your future,
OK,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
be, like, no worse than
the happiest days of your past, man.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.320
What does that mean?

13:22.320 --> 13:25.920
Being on the East Coast has done
strange things to your head, man.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.080
DOORBELL RINGS

13:27.080 --> 13:28.240
DOORBELL RINGS

13:28.240 --> 13:31.920
Oh, Victor, Victor, Victor.
The first guest.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.840
The Rama Kucha man,
he used to say, er,

13:34.840 --> 13:38.600
the first guest to show up
at a wedding - OK? -

13:38.600 --> 13:42.000
will, like, always have
a profound effect

13:42.000 --> 13:44.960
on the relationship
of that couple, man.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.720
Can't wait to see who it is.

13:45.720 --> 13:49.720
Can't wait to see who it is.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.120
Hi. Who are you?

13:53.120 --> 13:54.040
Who are you?

13:54.040 --> 13:55.880
Who are you?

13:55.880 --> 13:57.720
Move it or lose it, Goofy!

13:57.720 --> 14:00.560
Mother!
What are you doing here?

14:00.560 --> 14:03.760
I decided to drive down from
Peterborough and surprise you.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.560
Well it's not a good day.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.120
We're hosting this wedding
for Victor and Roberta.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.160
We're hosting this wedding
for Victor and Roberta.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.840
When I saw the morning coat and
flowers, I thought Mark had died.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.520
He's upstairs getting dressed.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.240
I have no intentions of driving
all the way back home again.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.000
No, no, no, it would be an honour
and a privilege

14:18.000 --> 14:20.040
for you to witness
the holding of my nuptials.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.160
for you to witness
the holding of my nuptials.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.000
She's right up those stairs.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.280
I've got to meet this woman.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.040
Oh, Victor,
I'm really terribly sorry.

14:28.040 --> 14:28.960
No trouble at all.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.000
No trouble at all.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.600
Sure. Have I told you
how grateful I am

14:31.600 --> 14:33.920
that you let us
have the ceremony here?

14:33.920 --> 14:34.840
DOORBELL CHIMES

14:34.840 --> 14:35.720
DOORBELL CHIMES

14:35.720 --> 14:39.720
DOORBELL CHIMES

14:52.240 --> 14:56.240
(GRUNTS)

14:58.720 --> 15:00.680
Hm.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.680
So, I understand
you've had a few arguments

15:06.680 --> 15:10.680
with my daughter since she was
appointed health services adviser.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.760
We don't seem to agree
as often as I'd like.

15:14.760 --> 15:18.120
I'm sure she hasn't told you,

15:18.120 --> 15:22.080
but she says that
you're a hell of a doctor

15:22.080 --> 15:23.880
and that you work too hard.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.640
A lot of work, and, unfortunately,
not enough people to help out.

15:26.640 --> 15:30.520
I can understand that all right.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.520
A couple of years ago,
I was coaching three crews

15:35.560 --> 15:39.560
while serving my fourth straight
term as rowing club captain.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.840
And still holding
down my regular job.

15:41.840 --> 15:45.840
When something good happened,
I couldn't really enjoy it,

15:46.280 --> 15:49.800
because there were always bad things
that came along to distract me.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.040
That sounds vaguely familiar.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.640
And then I took a step backwards.

15:55.640 --> 15:59.640
Then I realised we can
control our own lives just so far.

16:00.120 --> 16:04.000
If a crisis occurs,
you do your best.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.280
And, if it goes sour,
you can console yourself

16:06.280 --> 16:10.240
with the fact that you gave it
your best shot.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.000
You have a very healthy attitude.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Dr Westphall, this year,
I have a crew.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.760
These kids are talented.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.720
When we get this new
shell we've ordered,

16:20.720 --> 16:24.720
I'm convinced I can get some of them
into the Olympics this summer.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.760
My wife and I rented a beach house
in LA so we could watch the Games.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.560
I guess what
I really want to ask you is

16:35.560 --> 16:39.560
have I wasted my deposit
on that house?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.400
What makes you ask that?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.760
I've been in pretty heavy
pain for four months.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.600
Here I am, flat on my back
in the hospital

16:46.600 --> 16:48.680
for the first time in my life.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.000
I realise they don't tell me
everything,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.800
but I'm not blind, Doctor.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.640
I'm dying, aren't I?

16:57.640 --> 17:01.640
You have a tumour.
It's malignant.

17:04.200 --> 17:08.200
I guess I was hoping you'd say
I was a hypochondriac.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.160
Can I get you anything?

17:12.160 --> 17:16.160
A priest?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.359
You certainly have a lovely
day for the wedding.

17:28.359 --> 17:29.160
Isn't it?

17:29.160 --> 17:29.920
Isn't it?

17:29.920 --> 17:32.720
Isn't it?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.840
Hi, Peter.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.320
Whose side are you on?

17:36.320 --> 17:37.480
Whose side are you on?

17:37.480 --> 17:38.520
Whose side are you on?

17:38.520 --> 17:42.520
Too bad really, no-one at St Eligius
seems to think it'll last a year.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.240
OH! (SOBS)

17:48.240 --> 17:50.080
Ah, fantastic!

17:50.080 --> 17:53.280
I'll show you where you set out.
Right in here.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.000
I want to see my daughter. (SOBS)

17:55.000 --> 17:56.280
I want to see my daughter. (SOBS)

17:56.280 --> 17:57.800
I want to see my daughter.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.440
Darling, she says
she doesn't want to see you.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.440
Darling, she says
she doesn't want to see you.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.680
Excuse me, Doctor, would you happen
to have any tranquillisers?

18:06.680 --> 18:10.680
ACCORDION MUSIC STARTS UP

18:14.000 --> 18:15.240
Hi, Mrs Sloan.

18:15.240 --> 18:19.240
Get out.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.200
Mom! You seem tense.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.800
You can't get married.
Not until you know the truth.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.800
You have no idea what the future
holds in store.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.560
I never loved your father.

18:34.560 --> 18:38.560
See you downstairs.

19:33.120 --> 19:37.120
ACCORDION MUSIC CONTINUES

19:39.880 --> 19:43.880
Come on, Mark, smile.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.880
DOORBELL CHIMES

19:49.880 --> 19:51.720
Goofy, aren't you going
to greet your 28th guest?

19:51.720 --> 19:53.000
Goofy, aren't you going
to greet your 28th guest?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.520
Goofy, aren't you going
to greet your 28th guest?

19:56.520 --> 19:58.200
Dr Ridley, you've got to come quick.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.000
Now?

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Now?

20:03.240 --> 20:07.240
Hi. Around back!

20:07.240 --> 20:08.840
SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS

20:08.840 --> 20:10.560
&lt; I won't do it!

20:10.560 --> 20:11.280
She won't do what?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.840
She won't do what?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.040
Oh.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.360
Victor, I'm sorry, I did everything
I could but show stag films.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.240
Where's White when I need him?

20:18.240 --> 20:20.160
Where's White when I need him?

20:20.160 --> 20:22.240
Have you tried
talking to her, Victor?

20:22.240 --> 20:23.360
She won't let me in.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.120
You know he can't see
the bride before the wedding.

20:26.120 --> 20:27.640
OK, I'll talk to her.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.920
Great.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.320
I said around back!

20:30.320 --> 20:32.200
I said around back!

20:32.200 --> 20:34.360
Trying to get in the front door.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.920
No, no, no! Please, stop it.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.920
No, this is a friend of mine.
We work together at the hospital.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.040
Oh, great! Goofy's got himself
a little, black sidekick.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.560
What's your name, Mickey?!
(CHUCKLES)

20:45.560 --> 20:48.440
I'm sorry. What can I say?
It's Craig's mother-in-law.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.000
I understand.
She's an old broad.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.960
Probably never
heard of the Civil Rights Act.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.920
The word "civil"
isn't in her vocabulary.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.920
Don't worry about it. She comes
near me again, I'll deck her!

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
(PANTS) Hey, pup.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.280
DOG GROWLS AND BARKS

21:13.640 --> 21:17.640
Nothing's impossible. If you wanted
to make it happen, you could.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.680
What was that all about?

21:24.680 --> 21:28.520
I called the guy in Canada who makes
the shells for the rowing club.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.080
I want my father to see
the new shell.

21:31.080 --> 21:35.080
But he says he can't get here today.
He says it'll take a month.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.520
Have you tried
someone at the rowing club?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.960
Have you tried
someone at the rowing club?

21:38.960 --> 21:42.960
The only one I could reach was
Doc Bogart and he said I was crazy.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.880
You are crazy.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.880
Dad's lived his whole life for us.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.560
He's got nothing to show for it.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.560
Yeah, except a wife, five kids,
all those crews he's coached.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.160
It's quite a legacy, Joan.

21:57.160 --> 22:00.040
I always...

22:00.040 --> 22:03.040
felt bad because I wasn't a boy.

22:03.040 --> 22:07.040
And couldn't be an oarsman.
That's why I want to do this.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.320
It'll let him know.

22:12.320 --> 22:16.320
I just want to go on being
his daughter for ever.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.640
Excuse me. Excuse me.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.920
Victor. You wait all this time
for the ceremony?

22:31.920 --> 22:35.920
A smidgen longer.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.960
Oh, how is she, how is she?

22:37.960 --> 22:41.520
She's fine...as soon as
Mrs Craig finished sewing up
the rip in the wedding dress.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.560
Rip?

22:42.560 --> 22:45.200
We had to stop Roberta
from tearing it completely.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.160
(ROBERTA) No!

22:47.160 --> 22:51.160
Have you ever thought about eloping?

22:51.960 --> 22:55.720
The Rama Kucha puts his hand
on the guy's forehead, right?

22:55.720 --> 22:59.080
The next thing you know, the dude
is up tap dancing around the room.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.520
I mean, I was there, I saw it.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.360
What I want to know is, how come
you guys can't do that, man?

23:05.360 --> 23:08.760
Excuse me, Dogger,
I want to be sick.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.040
See that's what I mean, man,

23:10.040 --> 23:13.640
the Rama Kucha doesn't know
the meaning of the word "puke".

23:13.640 --> 23:17.240
LAVATORY FLUSHES

23:17.240 --> 23:21.240
Hey, gnarly party, man, really. Huh.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.120
Dr Craig, are you having a good time?

23:25.120 --> 23:28.160
Your buddy Dogger was
meditating in the pantry.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.760
The accordion player you hired
can barely play "Lady Of Spain"

23:31.760 --> 23:33.520
and my mother-in-law is here.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.200
No, I'm not having a good time.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.640
Well, is Mrs Craig
enjoying herself?

23:37.640 --> 23:40.200
Ehrlich, if this three-ringer
isn't over in an hour,

23:40.200 --> 23:41.760
I'm shutting it down.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.400
Dr Craig, on my word as a doctor,
nothing else will go wrong.

23:44.400 --> 23:48.400
DOORBELL CHIMES

23:50.720 --> 23:53.480
Please, come on in,
where have you been?

23:53.480 --> 23:54.960
Oh, I got lost.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.320
In aisle 3 of the Liquor Barn.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.800
Oh, no, no, no.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.640
See I've found the tunnel
all right,

24:00.640 --> 24:03.920
but then I ended up on something
drive instead of the expressway.

24:03.920 --> 24:07.920
Ha! And there I was,
on the wrong side of the river!

24:08.440 --> 24:09.560
(LAUGHS)

24:09.560 --> 24:12.280
You know, they really ought
to make those signs bigger.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.600
Oh, thank you.

24:13.600 --> 24:17.040
(LAUGHS)

24:17.040 --> 24:21.040
55 minutes, Ehrlich.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.080
Come on, pup.

24:27.080 --> 24:30.040
If you're ready
for Heartbreak Hill, so am I.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.960
If we were smart,
we'd call it a day right here.

24:32.960 --> 24:36.960
Right, boy?

24:38.760 --> 24:41.080
Come on, pup.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.280
Come on, go for it!

24:43.280 --> 24:47.280
Attaboy.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.960
I guess this is where
we separate the men from the dogs!

24:52.960 --> 24:56.960
(MAN)  Could be food poisoning?

24:58.360 --> 25:02.360
Hiya, Peter.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.720
TAPPING

25:06.720 --> 25:08.560
CHATTER AND ACCORDIAN STOP

25:08.560 --> 25:12.560
I'm sorry for the delay,
but you know how expectant women are.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.040
(ALL AGREE)

25:15.040 --> 25:16.480
No, not that kind of expectant!

25:16.480 --> 25:17.760
Louder, Goofy!

25:17.760 --> 25:19.960
(SHOUTS) Not that kind of expectant.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.680
So, eat, drink and have a good time,
OK?

25:23.680 --> 25:24.600
Louder.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.600
Louder.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.280
Here's Joanie.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.320
Don Bundy!

25:34.320 --> 25:35.560
Don Bundy!

25:35.560 --> 25:38.320
Ah! (LAUGHS)

25:38.320 --> 25:40.320
Look at you. You've grown up.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.080
Did she ever tell you that she used
to have a crush on you

25:43.080 --> 25:44.440
the size of Rhode Island?!

25:44.440 --> 25:46.440
Dad!

25:46.440 --> 25:49.560
We've been talking about the time
your father kicked Don off the team.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.760
When? I don't remember that.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.520
When I first went
out from rowing, I was cocky.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.440
Oh, to say the least!

25:56.440 --> 25:59.000
One day, Charlie was pushing us
and pushing us.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
And I smart-mouthed back,
using a 12-letter word.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.120
So I made him row back to the dock,

26:05.120 --> 26:08.840
pointed right at Don and I said,
"OK, you, out of the boat."

26:08.840 --> 26:11.320
(LAUGHS) I went home
and I told my father,

26:11.320 --> 26:14.240
who was pretty influential
at the rowing club.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.320
I was positive that he'd chew
Charlie out.

26:17.320 --> 26:21.320
Instead, he said, "You call
him back and you apologise now."

26:23.760 --> 26:25.000
I did.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
So all was forgiven, right?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.120
The hell it was.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.960
Oh, no, I didn't let him get near
that boat for three months.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.600
And I learned the lesson -

26:32.600 --> 26:34.880
you can't slide through life
just saying I'm sorry.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.560
Sometimes flowers help! (GROANS)

26:37.560 --> 26:40.000
Charlie, are you all right?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.240
Yeah, sure, yeah.

26:41.240 --> 26:44.560
You've been having too many visitors
and not enough rest.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.320
Come on now, everybody out.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.600
You, too, Sam,

26:47.600 --> 26:49.920
you can visit tomorrow
when he's feeling better.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.920
Bye, Dad.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.560
Your brother told me you were trying
to get the shell. Any luck?

26:58.560 --> 27:00.560
I'm reaching dead ends all around.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.120
The guy in Canada's not even
returning my calls any more.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.280
I'm sorry, Mom.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.400
That's OK, honey.

27:08.400 --> 27:12.400
It was a nice idea.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.440
You know, whenever I see Charlie,
he always talks about how proud

27:15.440 --> 27:18.640
he is of you, of all his kids.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.760
Thanks for stopping by, Don.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.960
When I heard, I just had to.

27:23.960 --> 27:24.960
You take care.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.000
You take care.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Bye, Sam.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.240
Gotcha!

27:49.240 --> 27:53.120
I spotted you about a half mile
ahead of me and picked you off.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.560
That's the best part of running -
picking people off.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.880
Want to race?

27:57.880 --> 27:59.560
First one to the top of the hill
ten bucks?

27:59.560 --> 28:01.360
First one to the top of the hill
ten bucks?

28:01.360 --> 28:03.200
Lovely skills!

28:03.200 --> 28:05.240
Cramp - mineral deficiency.

28:05.240 --> 28:09.240
Baloney! No vitamin is going
to get you the top of this hill.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.440
I've got to gut it out.
I'm running the marathon.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.520
Hooked on the mystique
of the Boston Marathon, huh?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.920
Hooked on the mystique
of the Boston Marathon, huh?

28:15.920 --> 28:18.040
Ah, the thrill died for me in '71.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.200
My entry application was rejected.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.120
Women can't run that far!

28:22.120 --> 28:23.160
Pretty lame, huh?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.200
Pretty lame, huh?

28:24.200 --> 28:26.440
The next year they were singing
a different tune.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.680
I say to hell with them.
I haven't bothered to enter since.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.240
Almost there.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.160
Oh! We made it.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.680
Easy as pie.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.680
Thanks.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.080
Thanks.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.800
You did it, nobody carried you.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.560
Contrary to popular opinion, it's
not all downhill hill from here!

28:44.560 --> 28:47.600
(LAUGHS) Hey, um, my name's Phil.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.400
Bye, Phil.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.920
Hey, what's your name?

28:50.920 --> 28:52.640
Catch me and I'll tell you.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.640
(MUMBLES) Catch you! How could I?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.680
LAVATORY FLUSHES

29:02.680 --> 29:06.680
(WOMAN) Oh, oh, oh, my God.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.080
Oh, is that decaf?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.000
No. Do you want
anything in your coffee?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
Yeah, Kahlua. (GIGGLES)

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Where was I?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.400
Oh. OK.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.440
Now... Now, your career's a bust,

29:24.440 --> 29:28.440
but you have got
this incredible lifeline.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.720
I mean, you will live to be at
least...

29:33.000 --> 29:34.080
..60.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.960
For crying out loud, lady,
look at the man!

29:36.960 --> 29:40.600
He's obviously very successful
and well into his 70s.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
I always thought of Ehrlich
as bizarre,

29:42.600 --> 29:45.240
but with you as a role model,
I'm surprised he turned out at all.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.520
I'm serious.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.360
I've no respect for a woman
who hasn't the decency

29:49.360 --> 29:53.360
to show up sober
at her nephew's wedding.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.120
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.160
I've embarrassed Victor
in front of all of his friends.

30:00.160 --> 30:03.640
Nonsense. Weddings are a time
for indulgence.

30:03.640 --> 30:07.120
No, you see, whenever Victor
writes or calls me,

30:07.120 --> 30:11.120
all he talks about are his wonderful
friends at St Eligius.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.600
I mean, he says that

30:14.600 --> 30:18.600
he really has a family
for the first time in his life.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.800
And especially you.
Especially you, Dr Craig.

30:23.920 --> 30:27.920
To Victor,
you're the father that he never had.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.840
Yeah, well.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.800
We all respect Victor's talents
as a surgeon,

30:32.800 --> 30:33.880
isn't that right, Mark?

30:33.880 --> 30:35.200
isn't that right, Mark?

30:35.200 --> 30:37.880
We think you should be proud of
the job you've done raising him.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.920
Am I right, Mark?

30:39.920 --> 30:41.280
Er, right.

30:41.280 --> 30:45.280
If you'll excuse me, I have to check
on some of the other guests.

30:46.640 --> 30:50.280
LAVATORY FLUSHES

30:50.280 --> 30:54.280
Victor was right.
I mean, he's a wonderful man.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.680
But I still feel I should
go round and apologise.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.640
There's still time
before the ceremony

31:01.640 --> 31:03.760
for you to go back out there
and mingle.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.520
So sober up.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.640
Drink that coffee before it's...

31:07.640 --> 31:11.640
too late.

31:24.440 --> 31:28.440
CHEERING

32:03.960 --> 32:05.720
CHEERING SUBSIDES

32:05.720 --> 32:09.720
(PANTS)

32:11.520 --> 32:15.520
(LAUGHS)

32:23.160 --> 32:27.160
(GROANS AND EXHALES LOUDLY)

32:35.920 --> 32:39.840
OK, we're all here.
What's the big surprise?

32:39.840 --> 32:41.400
We don't know.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.960
Doc Bogart called and told us
to bring you down here.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.640
It's ridiculous.

32:47.640 --> 32:48.520
Charlie!

32:48.520 --> 32:49.560
Charlie!

32:49.560 --> 32:53.560
Hey, quit this.
Get your butt back down to the club!

32:54.600 --> 32:57.560
Rachel, you sweetheart.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.320
Oh, God.

32:59.320 --> 32:59.920
Hey, Dad!

32:59.920 --> 33:01.160
Hey, Dad!

33:01.160 --> 33:05.160
Take a look.

33:13.880 --> 33:17.880
(CREW MEMBER)
Overhead up! OK, roll it.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.640
I can't believe it.

33:27.640 --> 33:30.840
I did everything I could to get
that shell, how did you do it?

33:30.840 --> 33:34.840
We all pulled together.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.960
Coach. Your Olympic trials crew
is ready.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.560
Oh.

34:09.560 --> 34:13.560
If you'd told me, I could have gotten
you a deal on a whole case!

34:20.800 --> 34:23.679
Now don't worry about a thing.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.719
I christen the...

34:26.719 --> 34:30.000
..the Charlie Halloran

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

34:43.560 --> 34:46.159
It's not fair.
Where's Chandler?

34:46.159 --> 34:48.480
He'll be here.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.040
It's already too late.
I'm sure I missed the ceremony.

34:51.040 --> 34:55.040
Calm down, Fiscus,
there'll be leftovers.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.280
Finally.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.400
Sorry, Wayne.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.080
Did you make it?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.240
Yes.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.800
Yes.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.520
Just between the three of us,
admit it,

35:04.520 --> 35:06.080
it was a pretty stupid thing to do.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.160
No.

35:07.160 --> 35:08.880
You don't look so good.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.000
How are you feeling?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.080
How are you feeling?

35:11.080 --> 35:12.960
Spoken like a true champion.

35:12.960 --> 35:16.880
Terrible. Just terrible.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.800
Bye, Mom, Dad, I'm sorry.

35:19.800 --> 35:23.000
LAVATORY FLUSHES

35:23.000 --> 35:25.800
(TUTS)

35:25.800 --> 35:27.960
Maurice,
hope you feel better.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.320
Yeah. (GROANS WEAKLY)

35:31.320 --> 35:33.880
Let's play Fish, it's fun.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.760
He was right about you.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.760
Ah, right. How about Crazy Eights?

35:40.280 --> 35:42.840
OK, Roberta, enough of this crapola.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.680
Now, quit the lollygagging
and get married.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.080
I don't want to.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.440
My parents have been living a lie,
a sham, a...

35:49.440 --> 35:51.800
Time to grow up, Roberta.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.800
You can't predict the future.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.760
Do you think
I wanted Ellen to marry Mark?

35:55.760 --> 35:58.160
But that's turned out OK
...for them.

35:58.160 --> 36:01.200
Now the chances of your being happy
are pretty dismal.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.200
But if you don't take the risk,

36:03.200 --> 36:05.600
you'll never have any chance
to be happy at all.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.320
Up! Get up!

36:08.320 --> 36:10.840
You, go downstairs and tell them
it's showtime.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.160
All right, OK.
Just pick one card, any card.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.960
A grown man playing games.
Ridiculous!

36:15.960 --> 36:18.360
Now come over here,
let's see your dress.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.240
You're all set.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.440
What are you waiting for?

36:21.440 --> 36:24.080
It's the worst day of my life.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.080
Ehrlich. I've got good news.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.760
Roberta wants to tie the knot.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.200
Oh, no, not again.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.120
No, no, no, I mean to get married.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.000
Right, right.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.920
I found him
under the dining-room table.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.840
Here, I'll give you a hand.
OK, come on, pal. Here you go.

36:38.840 --> 36:42.320
Come on, come on.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.360
I don't care.
I don't care.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.320
This wedding goes on as planned.

36:46.320 --> 36:49.000
All I need is a bride,
a groom and some music.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.880
             (DOGGER)  It was awesome,
you know?

36:50.880 --> 36:52.680
Victor, what's happening, man?

36:52.680 --> 36:55.680
Dogger, old pal, old buddy of mine.
How come you didn't get sick?

36:55.680 --> 36:59.320
You kiddin' me, man?
I've been macrobiotic since '73.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.600
Do me a favour, go get Roberta.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.400
All right!

37:02.400 --> 37:03.720
All right!

37:03.720 --> 37:06.280
It's amazing what you learn about
people at their wedding.

37:06.280 --> 37:10.000
Dogger was telling me about 1967,
you and the Gillingham twins.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.080
Gillingham twins?

37:12.080 --> 37:13.440
Oh, my gosh! Yes.

37:13.440 --> 37:17.440
They lived in a dome. They did this
thing called the Chinese basket job.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.040
What am I doing, it's my wedding?

37:19.040 --> 37:22.600
Believe it or not, this reminds
me of my third marriage.

37:22.600 --> 37:26.400
We can't all be pearls.
Mel, strike up the band.

37:26.400 --> 37:30.400
HE PLAYS "HERE COMES THE BRIDE"

37:31.520 --> 37:33.880
I do.

37:33.880 --> 37:37.840
Get out of here, would you, please?

37:37.840 --> 37:39.800
(LAUGHS)

37:39.800 --> 37:43.800
I do.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.160
MUSIC STOPS

37:55.160 --> 37:58.640
I can't marry you.
We lost Reverend Collingsworth.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.200
He went down to the hospital
with the first wave of victims.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.760
Said it reminded him of his
missionary days in New Guinea.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.880
That does it. That tears it.
I tried. I give up.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.720
The fates have decreed this guy
is not getting married today.

38:09.720 --> 38:13.720
Victor, man,
you've got to get married today.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.040
Because we love each other, right?

38:15.040 --> 38:19.040
Because we love each other, right?

38:19.160 --> 38:23.160
You're right.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.720
WOMAN GROANS

38:28.720 --> 38:31.280
Annie. What's going on?

38:31.280 --> 38:33.720
Craig's house, food poisoning.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.240
I'm going to toss my canapes again!

38:37.240 --> 38:38.960
Stomach pumps all around.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.760
All your prayers have been answered.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.920
Looks like the wedding's
coming to you!

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
Hi, Peter.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.840
Hi, Peter.

38:46.840 --> 38:50.840
Oh, oh, I deserve to be first,
I'm the maid of honour.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.600
Right here.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.840
I just can't believe it.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.080
There were people there
I hadn't seen in years.

38:58.080 --> 39:02.000
I didn't know Dennis is president
of First Federal.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
And Jim, chairman of the board
at Lampert Levine!

39:07.360 --> 39:11.000
And Jeremy Hoggan,
rowing coach at Lee High.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.440
Did you see the shell?

39:12.440 --> 39:14.240
Yes I did, it's a beauty.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.080
I want you to do me a favour.
Try to get some rest.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.920
Not yet, no.

39:19.920 --> 39:23.920
I'll see you later.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.560
Shall I go get you some magazines?

39:29.560 --> 39:33.560
No. No, just sit and stay with me
for a while.

39:39.360 --> 39:42.520
I've been thinking, I feel kind
of badly I never took you

39:42.520 --> 39:46.520
on one of those Caribbean cruises
you were always yapping at me about.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.320
Oh, well, we all make mistakes.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.400
Marie, I know I'm not the best
husband in the world.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.880
Charlie!

39:54.880 --> 39:57.160
I do. I mean, I'm loud,
I'm opinionated,

39:57.160 --> 39:59.800
I don't do what you want me
to do all the time.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.320
I even argue with
you about raising the kids.

40:02.320 --> 40:06.320
Charlie, I swear.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.480
There hasn't been
a moment in the last 39 years

40:10.480 --> 40:14.480
that I haven't thanked
God Almighty for giving me you.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.920
The feeling is mutual.

40:40.920 --> 40:44.760
Excuse me, sorry,
got to get this through.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.640
Do you, Victor, take this woman,
Roberta, to be your wife,

40:47.640 --> 40:50.040
to live together in a
covenant of marriage?

40:50.040 --> 40:52.560
Will you love her,
comfort her, honour

40:52.560 --> 40:55.040
and keep her in sickness
and in health,

40:55.040 --> 40:58.800
forsaking all others be faithful to
her as long as you both shall live?

40:58.800 --> 41:00.160
(VICTOR) I do.

41:00.160 --> 41:03.520
And do you, Roberta, take this
man, Victor, to be your husband,

41:03.520 --> 41:06.400
to live together in a covenant
of marriage?

41:06.400 --> 41:07.640
Will you love him,

41:07.640 --> 41:11.040
comfort him, honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health,

41:11.040 --> 41:13.440
and forsaking all others
be faithful to him

41:13.440 --> 41:15.120
as long as you both shall live?

41:15.120 --> 41:18.200
Oh, yes. Positive. Definitely.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.440
A simple "I do" will suffice.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.520
A simple "I do" will suffice.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.960
Attagirl!

41:21.960 --> 41:23.800
Now the couple would like
to exchange

41:23.800 --> 41:27.800
their own personally written vows.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.880
You're like a woody
on the sand at Carmel

41:32.880 --> 41:33.840
on a summer's day...

41:33.840 --> 41:34.960
on a summer's day...

41:34.960 --> 41:38.960
Perhaps we'll skip the rest of this.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.920
As constant as the waves
rolling on the shore,

41:42.920 --> 41:45.320
so will my love be for you.

41:45.320 --> 41:48.840
You are a sweet summer song
in a cold Boston winter.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.840
Now that's poetry.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.720
You are a puppy frolicking
in the woods

41:54.720 --> 41:57.600
and I am a kitty,
asleep in the warm.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.240
Cut the Rod McKuen,
we're running out of time.

42:00.240 --> 42:01.560
And by the powers vested in me,

42:01.560 --> 42:04.680
I now pronounce you man
and wife. Kiss the bride.

42:04.680 --> 42:08.400
APPLAUSE

42:08.400 --> 42:12.400
I've never been a maid of honour
before, but I've got go.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.600
Charlie! Oh, my God. Charlie! &gt;

42:28.600 --> 42:32.600
Dr Westphall, we need you.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.360
Bob, call the code.

42:38.360 --> 42:39.120
Charlie!

42:39.120 --> 42:41.640
Charlie!

42:41.640 --> 42:42.840
What is... What's happening?

42:42.840 --> 42:45.680
What is... What's happening?

42:45.680 --> 42:47.120
Come on.

42:47.120 --> 42:51.120
Come on.

42:56.040 --> 43:00.040
What's going on?

43:01.960 --> 43:05.480
Take it easy, Mark, the whole thing
worked out for the best.

43:05.480 --> 43:06.640
How is it going to sound

43:06.640 --> 43:10.640
when it gets around that 40 people
had food poisoning at my house?

43:11.320 --> 43:13.160
By tomorrow, I'll be
the laughing stock

43:13.160 --> 43:15.080
of the entire
Boston medical community.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.520
You got two young people started
off on the road to matrimony,

43:18.520 --> 43:21.200
I think that's very nice.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.400
I'll go warm up your milk.

43:24.400 --> 43:25.920
Dr Craig!

43:25.920 --> 43:29.920
I must have dozed off.

43:37.360 --> 43:37.920
Luther?

43:37.920 --> 43:39.520
Luther?

43:39.520 --> 43:40.680
What the...?

43:40.680 --> 43:43.960
Ellen, there's a Negro
in my pyjamas!

43:43.960 --> 43:45.640
No, he's not here.

43:45.640 --> 43:47.680
But I will give him the message.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.920
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.640
Who was that?

43:51.640 --> 43:55.560
Some guy babbling about doing
a documentary on Dr Craig.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.560
How was the wedding?

43:57.560 --> 44:01.560
Be grateful you were on call.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.600
  (TANNOY)  'Dr Stephanie Noble,
report to pathology.'

44:16.960 --> 44:20.440
Hello.

44:20.440 --> 44:24.440
He may have ruptured
an aneurysm in his brain.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.520
&lt; The respirator's the only thing
keeping him alive.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.320
We rushed the Cat scan.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.880
It shows
a massive cerebral haemorrhage.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.560
If he does come out of the coma,

44:33.560 --> 44:35.640
the damage to his brain
is so severe that...

44:35.640 --> 44:38.640
He'll be a vegetable?

44:38.640 --> 44:42.600
The question is, do you want
to leave him on a respirator?

44:42.600 --> 44:45.640
Or let him go?

44:45.640 --> 44:47.600
Personally, I don't
believe in giving up.

44:47.600 --> 44:50.560
But you do have that choice
according to

44:50.560 --> 44:54.560
hospital policy
on suspending life-support.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.360
Let him go.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.080
Mom?

44:59.080 --> 45:03.080
It's his time, Gary.

45:04.520 --> 45:07.160
I'd like us to go in now
and say goodbye.

45:07.160 --> 45:10.160
&lt; He won't hear us.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.440
Yes, he will.

45:12.440 --> 45:16.440
He'll know we're there.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.720
You OK?

45:46.720 --> 45:49.920
Of course.

45:49.920 --> 45:53.920
I'm Charlie Halloran's daughter.
