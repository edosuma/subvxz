01:15.077 --> 01:17.153
(Executive) Uh...

01:17.246 --> 01:20.864
(Whispering) I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.582
Gotta catch a plane.

02:07.292 --> 02:12.368
Two hours of staring at it to decide
to reconvene after the holidays?

02:12.463 --> 02:15.001
It's cosmetics, not curing cancer.

02:15.091 --> 02:19.420
- Aren't you going to the airport?
- To catch a six o'clock flight?

02:19.511 --> 02:22.761
Go with me on the eight.
You'll never get a cab.

02:22.848 --> 02:24.675
I said I'd be home by nine.

02:24.766 --> 02:26.925
- That's you.
- (Bell dings)

02:27.018 --> 02:30.304
Oh, damn it, I left my gloves
in Briars office.

02:30.397 --> 02:34.773
I don't need them. I get in the
elevator, taxi, plane and I'm home.

02:34.859 --> 02:36.898
Would you pick them up for me?

02:36.986 --> 02:39.144
- Happy holiday.
- See you in Chicago, John.

02:39.238 --> 02:40.732
You'll never make the six.

02:42.408 --> 02:43.902
(Horns honking)

02:43.992 --> 02:45.819
(Whistles)

02:59.465 --> 03:00.959
(Whistle)

03:03.927 --> 03:06.134
(Man) Taxi! Yo!

03:40.169 --> 03:41.580
(Laughs)

03:49.928 --> 03:51.470
Taxi!

03:51.555 --> 03:53.049
Oof!

03:53.140 --> 03:54.764
(Brakes screech)

03:54.849 --> 03:56.925
(Horns honking)

04:19.622 --> 04:21.579
Cab! Cab!

04:27.546 --> 04:29.254
Sir?

04:29.340 --> 04:31.498
Sir? Sir? Excuse me.

04:31.592 --> 04:34.083
I'm desperately late for a plane.

04:34.177 --> 04:37.878
Could I appeal to your good nature
and ask for your cab?

04:37.973 --> 04:40.926
I don't have a good nature.
Excuse me.

04:41.017 --> 04:44.967
- Come on!
- Could I offer you $10 for it?

04:45.062 --> 04:48.063
- 20. I'll give you $20 for it.
- I'll take 50.

04:49.358 --> 04:50.900
All right.

04:50.985 --> 04:56.061
Anyone who would pay $50 for a cab
would certainly pay $75.

04:56.156 --> 04:58.279
Not necessarily.

04:59.409 --> 05:02.529
All right, 75. You're a thief.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.412
Close. I'm an attorney.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.958
- Have a happy holiday.
- This will help.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.756
Hey! Hey! Hey!

05:18.844 --> 05:21.334
Hey, that's my cab! That's my cab!

05:21.429 --> 05:23.801
Pull over! Pull over!

05:23.890 --> 05:25.799
All right. Pull over!

05:25.892 --> 05:28.180
That's my cab!

05:28.269 --> 05:32.017
Pull over, buddy!
You're messing with the wrong guy!

05:38.320 --> 05:40.989
You son of a bitch!
This is my cab! Out!

05:45.160 --> 05:47.199
(Horns honking)

06:00.966 --> 06:02.460
Excuse me.

06:03.552 --> 06:05.010
Excuse me.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.720
Excuse me.

06:10.391 --> 06:11.802
Excuse me.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.469
(PA) 'Your attention, please.
Your attention, please.

06:18.565 --> 06:23.393
'Mid-Central flight 909

06:23.487 --> 06:27.614
'For further information,

06:27.699 --> 06:31.364
(Boy) When are Grandma
and Grandpa coming?

06:31.452 --> 06:33.741
They'll be here tomorrow, honey.

06:33.829 --> 06:38.242
Mom? Do you think Grandpa Walt
will give me a noogie?

06:38.334 --> 06:42.545
Of course he'll give you a noogie.
It means he loves you.

06:42.629 --> 06:46.330
- Why don't I get noogies?
- Because you get Indian burns.

06:46.424 --> 06:48.749
But I prefer noogies.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.670
(Phone)

06:50.762 --> 06:53.597
Keep an eye on your brother.

06:54.765 --> 06:57.007
- Hello.
- (Girl) Who is it?

06:57.101 --> 07:00.470
- Shh. Where are you?
- Who is it?

07:00.562 --> 07:02.140
Shh! It's Daddy.

07:02.231 --> 07:05.730
- Flight delay.
- When do you think you'll be in?

07:05.817 --> 07:08.771
- Shouldn't be later than ten.
- I'll wait up for you.

07:44.436 --> 07:46.263
I know you, don't I?

07:46.355 --> 07:50.222
I'm usually good with names,
but I've forgotten yours.

07:50.317 --> 07:52.605
You stole my cab.

07:52.694 --> 07:56.691
I've never stolen anything
in my life.

07:56.781 --> 07:59.901
I hailed a cab on Park Avenue
this afternoon.

07:59.992 --> 08:03.076
And uh, before I could get in it,
you stole it.

08:05.748 --> 08:08.951
You're the guy
who tried to get my cab.

08:09.042 --> 08:10.916
I knew I knew you. Yeah!

08:11.002 --> 08:13.328
You scared the bejesus out of me.

08:17.592 --> 08:21.210
But it was awful easy
getting a cab during rush hour.

08:22.346 --> 08:26.047
- Forget it.
- I can't forget it.

08:26.141 --> 08:30.388
I am sorry.
I had no idea that was your cab.

08:30.479 --> 08:33.313
Let me make it up to you somehow,
please?

08:33.398 --> 08:35.556
How about a hot dog and a beer?

08:36.400 --> 08:39.270
- Er, no, thanks.
- Just a hot dog, then?

08:40.655 --> 08:42.315
I'm picky about what I eat.

08:42.405 --> 08:44.030
- Coffee?
- No.

08:44.116 --> 08:45.741
- Milk?
- No.

08:45.826 --> 08:49.160
Soda? Some tea? Lifesavers? Slurpee?

08:49.246 --> 08:50.705
Sir, please.

08:50.789 --> 08:53.790
Just let me know. I'm here.
(Chuckles)

08:53.875 --> 08:55.915
I knew I knew you.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.708
Discuss this with the ticket agent.

08:59.797 --> 09:03.213
I couldn't,
I didn't know he put me in coach.

09:03.301 --> 09:07.797
- I'm sorry. First class is full.
- I have a first class ticket.

09:07.888 --> 09:10.889
You have a coach seat assignment.

09:10.974 --> 09:13.346
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Liz.

09:15.896 --> 09:19.099
- Here OK?
- Oh, here, there. Anywhere's fine.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.230
Pardon me.

09:24.654 --> 09:27.358
You'll get a refund
on the difference.

09:27.448 --> 09:29.239
I don't want a refund,

09:29.325 --> 09:33.452
I want a seat in first class
where I was booked over a month ago.

09:33.537 --> 09:37.451
I've had just about enough of you.
Now take your seat.

09:37.541 --> 09:39.913
Oh, you've had about enough of me?

09:40.001 --> 09:43.619
You delay me, then you bump me.
What happens next?

09:43.713 --> 09:46.418
Is this a coincidence or what?

09:46.507 --> 09:48.334
Have a seat.

10:08.611 --> 10:11.565
I didn't introduce myself.
Del Griffith.

10:11.655 --> 10:14.858
American Light and Fixture,
Sales Director,

10:14.950 --> 10:17.073
shower curtain ring division.

10:18.704 --> 10:22.618
I sell shower curtain rings.
Best in the world.

10:26.211 --> 10:28.037
And you are?

10:28.129 --> 10:29.956
Uh, Neal Page.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.289
Pleased to meet you, Neal Page.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.214
What do you do for a living,
Neal Page?

10:37.346 --> 10:41.094
- Marketing.
- Marketing? Super. Super. Fabulous.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.891
Isn't that nice?

10:42.976 --> 10:48.017
Look, I don't want to be rude, but
I'm not much of a conversationalist.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.356
I'd like to finish this article.
A friend wrote it, so...

10:51.442 --> 10:53.684
Don't let me stand in your way.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.905
The last thing I want to be
is an annoying blabbermouth.

11:00.325 --> 11:02.365
Nothing grinds my gears worse

11:02.452 --> 11:05.453
than some chowderhead
who can't shut up.

11:05.539 --> 11:09.868
You catch me running off at the
mouth, give me a poke in the chops.

11:13.004 --> 11:14.628
(Sighs)

11:17.299 --> 11:18.959
Ohh!

11:19.051 --> 11:21.340
Ohh, that feels good.

11:21.428 --> 11:25.426
Oh, God, I'm telling you,
my dogs are barking today.

11:25.515 --> 11:27.342
Whew!

11:29.811 --> 11:33.014
Ohh! (Chuckles)

11:33.106 --> 11:35.857
That feels better.

11:35.942 --> 11:38.100
(Snoring)

11:46.493 --> 11:48.532
(Coughing)

12:02.174 --> 12:06.385
Six bucks and my right nut
says we're not landing in Chicago.

12:17.438 --> 12:19.478
(Phone)

12:24.445 --> 12:25.855
Hello?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.820
- 'Hi.'
- Where are you?

12:27.906 --> 12:32.782
- I'm in Wichita.
- 'Wichita, Kansas? What happened? '

12:32.869 --> 12:35.786
We couldn't land in Chicago.

12:35.872 --> 12:39.739
I don't understand what Wichita has
to do with a snowstorm in Chicago?

12:39.834 --> 12:42.325
What's going on, Neal?

12:42.420 --> 12:47.544
We took off from New York,
they closed Chicago, we landed here.

12:49.343 --> 12:51.169
(Del) Neal.

12:55.390 --> 12:57.466
Trouble on the home front?

12:57.559 --> 13:00.844
I really don't think
that's your concern.

13:00.937 --> 13:03.095
The finest line a man will walk

13:03.189 --> 13:06.522
is between success at work
and success at home.

13:06.609 --> 13:10.440
I got a motto -
like your work, love your wife.

13:10.529 --> 13:12.568
Well, I'll remember that.

13:14.115 --> 13:17.200
- What's the flight situation?
- Simple.

13:17.285 --> 13:20.452
There's no way
we'll get out of here tonight.

13:20.538 --> 13:25.116
We'd have more luck playing
pickup sticks with our butt cheeks.

13:25.209 --> 13:27.118
We'll find out soon enough.

13:27.211 --> 13:31.588
By the time the airline
cancels this flight, which they will,

13:31.673 --> 13:36.798
you'd have more of a chance finding
a three-legged ballerina than a room.

13:36.887 --> 13:40.931
- I could be stuck in Wichita?
- You are stuck in Wichita.

13:41.015 --> 13:43.257
(Click and feedback)

13:43.351 --> 13:47.479
'Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please? '

13:47.563 --> 13:51.395
I'm sorry to announce
that we're cancelling flight 909

13:51.483 --> 13:53.772
due to severe weather in Chicago.

13:53.860 --> 13:57.988
(Neal) Hi. I was wondering
if you had any rooms available?

13:58.073 --> 14:00.112
Anything will do.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.284
- 'I'm sorry.'
- Is there another motel...

14:03.369 --> 14:04.994
(Click)

14:10.126 --> 14:11.952
(Del) Neal.

14:12.044 --> 14:13.704
Hi.

14:13.796 --> 14:15.587
Well...

14:16.715 --> 14:18.672
Welcome to Wichita.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.629
Did you book a room yet?

14:21.720 --> 14:23.926
I, uh, couldn't get in anywhere.

14:24.013 --> 14:28.141
When we got in, you called home,
I called the Braidwood Inn.

14:28.226 --> 14:30.052
I missed that one.

14:30.144 --> 14:34.604
I got an idea. I know the manager,
I sold him some curtain rings.

14:34.690 --> 14:37.893
If you pick up the cab fare,
I'll get you a room.

14:37.985 --> 14:39.609
Uh...

14:45.992 --> 14:47.819
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Great.

14:47.910 --> 14:51.326
All right! Grab an end of this,
will you? Thanks.

14:56.335 --> 14:58.161
- Is this your trunk?
- Yeah.

14:58.253 --> 15:01.337
You should try lugging this thing
around New York City!

15:03.133 --> 15:05.125
(Rock music)

15:12.350 --> 15:15.765
♪ Well, he takes you up

15:15.853 --> 15:19.352
♪ And he beats you down, yeah

15:19.439 --> 15:23.057
♪ He plays around

15:23.151 --> 15:25.938
♪ And he spends your money... ♪

15:28.615 --> 15:30.654
Where the hell is the motel?

15:32.994 --> 15:35.781
- Doobby, is it much farther?
- Not much.

15:35.871 --> 15:38.327
Why didn't you take the interstate?

15:38.415 --> 15:41.286
You said your friend
has never been here

15:41.376 --> 15:44.247
so I figured
he'd like to... look around.

15:44.337 --> 15:48.335
- Ain't nothing on the interstate.
- It's night.

15:48.425 --> 15:53.929
I know, but he's proud of his town.
That's a damn rare thing these days.

15:55.806 --> 15:57.846
(Music continues)

16:06.566 --> 16:10.017
(Del) Take care of the luggage,
will you, Doobby?

16:10.111 --> 16:11.938
OK, Del.

16:14.198 --> 16:16.238
(Woman) Get off of me.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.119
Stick with me.

16:34.884 --> 16:36.923
(Del) Evening, Gus.

16:39.930 --> 16:42.600
Del Griffith! How the hell are you?

16:42.683 --> 16:45.637
Still a million bucks shy
of a millionaire.

16:45.727 --> 16:47.352
(Both laugh)

16:47.437 --> 16:51.138
Gus, meet an old friend, Neal Page.
Neal, Gus Mooney.

16:51.233 --> 16:52.857
Glad to meet you, Nick.

16:52.942 --> 16:56.810
Gus, I told my friend here
you'd fix him up with a room.

16:56.904 --> 16:59.360
You have a major credit card?

17:01.409 --> 17:04.160
You still honour
those discount credit cards?

17:04.244 --> 17:07.827
I'll have to charge you for a double,
but it'll come out even.

17:07.915 --> 17:12.041
There you go, saving money already.
We're a good team.

17:14.087 --> 17:17.919
We were going to Chicago
and the storm brought us here.

17:18.007 --> 17:21.506
I know. I have half your flight
booked in already.

17:21.594 --> 17:26.670
Well, I guess you're all fixed,
so, uh... there you are.

17:26.765 --> 17:29.434
- Last room in the complex.
- You mean sh-share?

17:31.228 --> 17:32.342
(Crash)

17:32.437 --> 17:34.893
(Del) Hey, easy on that. OK.

18:03.257 --> 18:06.958
- Hell of a cab ride, wasn't it?
- Yeah, great cab ride.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.757
You don't see cabs like that
too often.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.268
- Want to take a shower?
- No!

18:19.355 --> 18:21.478
I meant did you want to go first.

18:21.566 --> 18:24.021
(Laughs nervously) You thought...

18:24.110 --> 18:26.648
I wouldn't...
What do you think I am?

18:26.737 --> 18:29.406
Gee, that's funny. That's funny.

18:53.721 --> 18:55.843
Ah. Ah.

18:55.931 --> 18:58.801
Oh, come... Come on!

19:10.069 --> 19:11.943
Ah! Ouch, ouch, ouch!

19:13.197 --> 19:15.024
Ah! Ah!

19:17.242 --> 19:22.153
(TV) 'You don't have to be a rock'r
roller to wear a pompadour... '

19:22.247 --> 19:24.074
(Bed humming)

20:18.299 --> 20:20.291
(Tins clank)

20:27.098 --> 20:29.138
(Neal) Excuse me.

20:30.268 --> 20:32.095
(Grunting and sighing)

20:34.480 --> 20:38.180
(Del) I'd switch pillows
but I'm allergic to sponge.

20:38.275 --> 20:40.731
I'd be sneezing all night with that.

20:40.819 --> 20:44.603
That's why I carry my own pillow.
It's hypoallergenic.

20:52.705 --> 20:56.156
I had no idea
those beer cans would blow like that.

20:56.250 --> 21:00.711
You left them on a vibrating bed,
what did you think would happen?

21:00.796 --> 21:04.081
It's been a long day,
it just didn't occur to me.

21:05.342 --> 21:09.470
It didn't occur to you, so I
have to sleep in a puddle of beer.

21:09.554 --> 21:12.555
- You want to switch?
- I just want to sleep.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.131
Me, too. I am bushed.

21:16.352 --> 21:18.392
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:45.129 --> 21:50.253
(Woman on TV) 'She's sleeping in our
house! I'll have to burn the sheets! '

21:50.342 --> 21:53.627
(Man) 'What if the shoe
was on the other foot? '

21:53.720 --> 21:55.594
(Woman) 'I'd go barefoot! '

21:55.680 --> 21:57.507
(Cracking knuckles)

21:59.559 --> 22:01.598
(Sighs)

22:09.067 --> 22:10.894
(Crack!) Oh!

22:12.029 --> 22:13.855
(Sighs)

22:15.490 --> 22:17.529
(Scratching)

22:21.913 --> 22:26.040
(TV) 'Traffic is resuming
at O'Hare field shortly.'

22:26.917 --> 22:28.411
(Snorting)

22:28.502 --> 22:30.044
(Hawking)

22:30.129 --> 22:32.584
(Snorting and hawking continues)

22:43.724 --> 22:45.135
Sorry.

22:53.650 --> 22:55.690
(Hawking)

22:59.948 --> 23:01.572
Damn it!

23:02.659 --> 23:04.865
- What? What?
- That's it!

23:04.952 --> 23:07.490
If I don't clear my sinuses
I'll snore.

23:08.539 --> 23:11.575
If your kid spills his milk,
do you slap him?

23:11.667 --> 23:16.044
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You're not very tolerant.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.798
You've been under my skin
since New York,

23:18.882 --> 23:21.040
starting with ripping off my cab.

23:21.134 --> 23:25.879
- God, you're a tight-ass.
- Would you like a mouthful of teeth?

23:25.972 --> 23:29.554
Hostile, too.
Nice personality combination.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.765
That's borderline criminal.

23:31.852 --> 23:36.728
Screw you! You spill beer, you smoke,
you mess up the bathroom...

23:36.815 --> 23:42.319
Who let you stay? I even let you pay
so you didn't feel like an intruder.

23:42.404 --> 23:44.894
- Oh, I'm an intruder?
- Yes.

23:44.989 --> 23:47.480
I was having a perfectly nice trip!

23:47.575 --> 23:52.486
Who was it who talked my ear off on
the plane? Who was that? I'm curious.

23:52.580 --> 23:56.280
Who told you to book a room?
I did. From the goodness of my heart!

23:56.375 --> 23:59.541
You're an ungrateful jackass!
Go on, sleep in the lobby.

23:59.628 --> 24:03.376
I hope you wake up so stiff
you can't even move.

24:03.465 --> 24:07.296
You're no saint.
You got a free cab, a free room.

24:07.385 --> 24:10.588
And someone who'll listen
to your boring stories.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.886
Didn't you notice on the plane,

24:12.973 --> 24:16.176
eventually I started
reading the vomit bag?

24:17.227 --> 24:21.854
Didn't that give you a clue, like
maybe this guy's not enjoying it?

24:21.940 --> 24:25.984
Everything is not an anecdote.
You have to discriminate.

24:26.069 --> 24:30.944
You choose things that are funny
or mildly amusing or interesting.

24:31.032 --> 24:34.483
You're a miracle.
Your stories have none of that.

24:34.577 --> 24:37.328
They're not even
amusing accidentally.

24:38.622 --> 24:43.165
"Honey, I'd like you to meet Del,
he's got some amusing anecdotes."

24:43.251 --> 24:47.415
"And here's a gun to blow your brains
out, you'll thank me for it!"

24:48.423 --> 24:52.207
I-I could tolerate
any... any insurance seminar.

24:52.301 --> 24:55.255
For days I could listen to them
go on and on

24:55.346 --> 24:57.219
with a big smile on my face.

24:57.306 --> 24:59.678
They'd say, "How can you stand it?"

24:59.767 --> 25:04.393
And I'd say, "I've been with
Del Griffith. I can take anything."

25:05.480 --> 25:07.354
You know what they'd say?

25:07.440 --> 25:10.726
"I know what you mean.
The shower curtain ring guy."

25:12.362 --> 25:15.813
It's like going on a date
with a Chatty Cathy doll.

25:15.907 --> 25:20.652
I expect you have a string on your
chest that I have to pull out.

25:20.744 --> 25:23.615
Except I wouldn't pull it out.
You would.

25:23.705 --> 25:25.199
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

25:26.833 --> 25:29.834
And when you're telling
these stories,

25:29.919 --> 25:32.410
here's a good idea... have a point.

25:32.505 --> 25:36.123
It makes it much more
interesting for the listener.

25:50.021 --> 25:51.930
You want to hurt me?

25:52.023 --> 25:54.858
Go ahead,
if it makes you feel better.

25:54.943 --> 25:56.734
I'm an easy target.

25:58.905 --> 26:02.569
Yeah, you're right, I talk too much.

26:03.492 --> 26:05.531
I also listen too much.

26:06.411 --> 26:09.329
I could be a cold-hearted cynic
like you,

26:09.414 --> 26:12.581
but I don't like
to hurt people's feelings.

26:13.710 --> 26:17.458
Well, think what you want about me.
I'm not changing.

26:17.547 --> 26:19.586
I like... I like me.

26:20.466 --> 26:22.293
My wife likes me.

26:22.385 --> 26:24.211
My customers like me.

26:24.303 --> 26:28.135
Cos I'm the real article.
What you see is what you get.

28:16.740 --> 28:21.200
♪ I'm back in baby's arms

28:21.286 --> 28:25.615
♪ How I missed those lovi'n arms

28:25.707 --> 28:30.036
♪ I am back where I belong

Del.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.560
Hmm? Hmm?

28:50.646 --> 28:52.686
Why did you kiss my ear?

28:55.025 --> 28:57.695
Why are you holding my hand?

28:59.071 --> 29:01.063
Where's your other hand?

29:01.156 --> 29:03.113
Between two pillows.

29:04.201 --> 29:07.237
- Those aren't pillows!
- (Screams)

29:07.328 --> 29:09.784
(Both screaming and yelling)

29:19.423 --> 29:21.581
Grr! Whoo!

29:21.675 --> 29:23.584
Oof! Hoo!

29:24.761 --> 29:28.094
- See that Bears game last week?
- Hell of a game.

29:28.181 --> 29:31.965
Bears got a great team this year.
They're gonna go all the way.

29:32.060 --> 29:33.886
Ohh, yeeoow!

29:52.578 --> 29:54.820
Ohh...

30:00.085 --> 30:05.245
(Del) Take my socks out of the sink
if you're gonna brush your teeth.

30:10.762 --> 30:14.131
(Wife) Where are you?
(Neal) 'I'm in Wichita.'

30:14.223 --> 30:19.218
- You're still at the airport?
- 'I'm at a motel with a guy I met.'

30:19.311 --> 30:23.095
You shared a motel room
with a stranger? Are you crazy?

30:23.190 --> 30:24.850
'I'm getting there.'

30:24.942 --> 30:27.018
Did you call the airline?

30:27.110 --> 30:30.775
They said I have a good chance
of getting on standby.

30:30.864 --> 30:35.193
If they told you wolverines make
good pets would you believe them?

30:35.285 --> 30:39.234
I'm not spending Thanksgiving in
Wichita. I've got a family waiting.

30:39.330 --> 30:42.247
- I'll get home.
- Mm. Not by aeroplane.

30:42.333 --> 30:45.286
They got 18 hours
of air traffic backed up.

30:45.377 --> 30:49.588
Odds are we're gonna be having
our turkey roll right here...

30:50.590 --> 30:54.754
...if we wait for the flight.
- How else can we get home?

30:55.970 --> 30:59.339
Burt Dingman, my buddy,
works for the railroad.

30:59.432 --> 31:02.386
- Train?
- I sold them their curtain rings.

31:02.476 --> 31:04.765
He owes me a favour.

31:06.271 --> 31:10.565
I'll get that. I paid for
everything else. Why break precedent?

31:10.651 --> 31:12.477
I feel like a freeloader.

31:12.569 --> 31:16.483
- Get me on the train, we're square.
- You got it.

31:16.573 --> 31:18.649
(Del) That's the easy part.

31:22.870 --> 31:24.827
What?

31:24.914 --> 31:27.487
You know goddam well what.

31:28.584 --> 31:30.623
I'm sorry. I don't.

31:30.711 --> 31:32.952
I had over $700 in here.

31:34.256 --> 31:37.209
I didn't touch your dough.
I'm not a thief.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.672
You went into my stuff last night?

31:39.761 --> 31:43.972
I didn't take your money
and I don't care for the accusation.

31:44.056 --> 31:47.674
I had over $700 and you
went into my wallet for pizza.

31:47.768 --> 31:50.769
- Just maybe when you went in...
- Count it!

31:50.854 --> 31:54.389
- Like you'd keep it there.
- There's $263 in there.

31:54.483 --> 31:56.771
If there's more, then I'm a thief.

31:56.860 --> 31:59.979
Just count it. Count it!

32:00.071 --> 32:01.945
263, right?

32:04.992 --> 32:06.819
- Empty.
- What?

32:06.911 --> 32:08.737
Dry.

32:13.667 --> 32:16.336
- We were robbed.
- Do you think so(?)

32:18.004 --> 32:20.127
You know, I've been thinking.

32:20.215 --> 32:23.548
What we're dealing with
is a small-time crook.

32:23.635 --> 32:27.679
He didn't take the credit cards,
so we charge our way home.

32:27.763 --> 32:31.381
- What plastic you carry?
- Visa and a gasoline card.

32:31.475 --> 32:35.425
And a Neiman-Marcus card in case
we want to buy a gift for someone.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.806
- What have you got?
- Chalmer's Big Man Shoppe,

32:38.899 --> 32:41.354
a chain in the Pacific Northwest.

32:41.443 --> 32:44.230
Great stuff.
But it does us no good here.

32:44.320 --> 32:49.480
Never mind. Get me to the station
and I'll take care of everything.

32:49.575 --> 32:51.900
Gus's son's gonna pick us up.

32:56.206 --> 32:59.657
- This is not him, is it?
- Gee, I hope not.

33:35.034 --> 33:38.118
- Are you Gus's son?
- I'm Owen.

33:38.203 --> 33:40.243
(Snorts)

33:41.873 --> 33:45.574
- You the shower curtain fella?
- Yeah. Del Griffith.

33:45.669 --> 33:47.495
How are you?

33:47.587 --> 33:50.256
- This is Neal Page from Chicago.
- Hi.

33:50.340 --> 33:52.830
Pleased to meet you both.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.220
(Snorts)

34:00.224 --> 34:03.260
I'm to drive you to Wichita
to catch a train?

34:03.352 --> 34:05.225
Yeah, we'd appreciate it.

34:05.312 --> 34:08.063
- Train don't run out of Wichita.
- Hm?

34:08.148 --> 34:10.721
'Lessen you're a hog or cattle.

34:10.817 --> 34:12.476
(Snorts)

34:14.612 --> 34:18.027
People train
runs out of S-Stubbville.

34:18.114 --> 34:21.032
That'll be fine.
That'll be just fine.

34:23.536 --> 34:25.161
(Owen) Leave it be.

34:25.246 --> 34:28.995
Get your lazy behind out
and put that trunk in the back.

34:29.083 --> 34:32.417
- Oh, no. We've got it.
- It's very heavy.

34:32.503 --> 34:37.295
She don't mind. She's short
and skinny, but she's strong.

34:38.926 --> 34:42.509
Her first baby... come out sideways.

34:42.596 --> 34:44.838
She didn't scream or nothing.

34:44.931 --> 34:47.007
(Del) Isn't that something?

34:47.100 --> 34:48.844
You're a real trouper.

34:48.935 --> 34:51.603
We've got it already. It's done.

34:55.190 --> 34:58.476
Stubbville's
a little further than Wichita.

34:58.569 --> 35:01.107
- How much further?
- 30 miles.

35:02.239 --> 35:03.947
Maybe 40.

35:04.033 --> 35:09.027
No more than 45, though,
depending on which way he goes.

35:09.121 --> 35:11.446
On the back roads it could be 70.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.869
Give me the glove.

35:17.962 --> 35:20.998
Ow! Just nipped the little part. Ooh!

35:21.090 --> 35:23.545
Give him the goddam glove!

35:23.634 --> 35:25.508
(Neal) Are we there yet?

35:25.594 --> 35:28.299
(Del) No. A little way to go yet.

35:29.431 --> 35:32.100
Beautiful country, though, isn't it?

35:32.184 --> 35:35.386
(Neal) What's the temperature?
(Del) One.

36:00.585 --> 36:02.411
(Neal) Thanks.

36:06.966 --> 36:09.172
They didn't have two together.

36:09.259 --> 36:12.260
You got to be kidding me.
Oh, I knew it.

36:12.346 --> 36:17.506
I... The secretary was new,
and I explained it. Oh... I'm sorry.

36:17.600 --> 36:21.728
- I think they're just full.
- It's the holidays, I guess.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.019
Hey, we're lucky we got a ticket.

36:24.106 --> 36:27.356
Yeah. So, if I don't see you again...

36:27.443 --> 36:30.894
Want to get together
for a drink in the bar car?

36:30.988 --> 36:34.107
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- You sure?

36:34.199 --> 36:36.951
Yeah. Anyway, it's been interesting.

36:37.035 --> 36:40.238
That's the understatement
of the year.

36:40.330 --> 36:42.369
And thanks for the ticket.

36:44.292 --> 36:48.834
Neal! I need your address. I got
to pay you back for this ticket.

36:48.921 --> 36:53.132
- Ticket's a gift.
- No, come on. What's the address?

36:53.217 --> 36:54.924
Del, it's a gift.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.801
Happy holidays.

36:57.888 --> 36:59.927
Same to you.

37:15.445 --> 37:18.731
Hi. Going home for Thanksgiving?

37:18.824 --> 37:20.781
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

37:20.867 --> 37:22.907
Just gonna make it.

37:36.256 --> 37:38.712
(Metal grinding and scraping)

37:49.227 --> 37:50.851
(Heavy clunk)

37:59.111 --> 38:00.605
What did you do here?

38:00.696 --> 38:02.984
Did he say he smelled smoke?

38:28.304 --> 38:31.139
You walk a mile and a half
to the highway,

38:31.224 --> 38:34.390
the trucks will take you
into Jefferson City.

39:22.396 --> 39:24.472
You're in a pretty lousy mood, huh?

39:24.565 --> 39:26.806
To say the least.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.774
(Mice squeaking)

39:28.860 --> 39:31.149
You ever travelled by bus before?

39:33.072 --> 39:38.493
Hm. Your mood's probably not
gonna improve much. (Chuckles)

What, seriously?

43:45.222 --> 43:49.718
No, it's a figure of speech.
I'm on the road so much, you know.

43:49.809 --> 43:54.436

44:14.874 --> 44:17.745
We've really gotten nowhere.

I think I'm holding you up.

Oh, don't say that about yourself.
That's not true, Neal.

44:24.717 --> 44:28.548
No, I think we'll get
to where we're going a lot faster

44:28.637 --> 44:30.713
if, uh... we were alone.

44:30.806 --> 44:32.632
OK?

44:36.102 --> 44:38.225
OK. I see.

44:45.903 --> 44:49.354
I think I'll just take care of this
and get going.

44:49.448 --> 44:53.528
I appreciate that.
It's harder for two people to travel.

44:53.618 --> 44:56.572
- Sure it is.
- You've got reservations...

44:56.663 --> 44:58.904
- I know.
- Thanks for the meal.

44:58.998 --> 45:02.367
That's all right.
And I owe you some of this, too.

Yes.

48:41.620 --> 48:44.076
How may I help you?

48:44.164 --> 48:48.244
You can start by wiping
that fucking dumb-ass smile

48:48.335 --> 48:51.501
off your rosy fucking cheeks.

48:51.588 --> 48:54.542
Then you can give me
a fucking automobile.

A fucking Datsun, a fucking Toyota,
a fucking Mustang, a fucking Buick.

49:00.763 --> 49:03.764
I don't care for the way
you're speaking to me.

49:03.849 --> 49:08.558
I don't care for the way your company
left me in the middle of nowhere

49:08.645 --> 49:12.180
with fucking keys to a fucking car
that isn't fucking there.

49:12.274 --> 49:16.651
And I really didn't care to fucking
walk down a fucking highway

49:16.736 --> 49:18.645
and across a fucking runway

49:18.738 --> 49:22.356
to get back here to have you
smile in my fucking face.

49:22.450 --> 49:29.662
I want a fucking car
right fucking now.

49:32.751 --> 49:35.455

49:35.545 --> 49:38.118

- Chicago.

- Chicago?
- Chicago.

50:15.248 --> 50:17.205
You know you're in St Louis?

50:17.292 --> 50:19.617
Yes, I do.

50:19.711 --> 50:24.254
Try the airlines, they're faster
and you get a free meal.

50:24.340 --> 50:28.172

I'd watch you take a leak.

50:29.970 --> 50:34.133

- Just a minute, OK?

50:57.704 --> 50:59.697
Get it out of here!

51:00.832 --> 51:04.830
What is your problem?
You insensitive asshole!

51:04.919 --> 51:07.671
Can't you see we've got
an injured man here?

51:07.755 --> 51:11.587
Now, I'll move my car
but you help him up.

51:11.675 --> 51:14.047
- No!
- My pleasure.

that when we parted ways,

our paths would cross again.

Whew.

Oh, come on.

(Screaming)

59:02.485 --> 59:04.312
What's happening?

59:04.403 --> 59:07.321
Oh, w-we almost hit a deer.
That's all.

59:08.282 --> 59:09.906
Are you all right?

59:11.034 --> 59:13.074
Yes, I'm fine. Yes, I'm fine.

59:13.161 --> 59:15.652
It's awful hot. Take your parka off.

59:15.747 --> 59:16.743
Yes. Yes, I will.

59:36.266 --> 59:38.721
(Horns blaring)

59:47.443 --> 59:52.947
(Man) There's a guy on the wrong side
of the highway. He'll kill somebody!

59:53.032 --> 59:55.653
- (Honking horn)
- Oh, my God!

59:55.742 --> 59:58.447
(Man) Hey! Hey!

59:59.579 --> 01:00:01.619
(Honks horn)

01:00:01.706 --> 01:00:03.533
Hey, what's going on?

01:00:03.625 --> 01:00:05.617
Some joker wants to race.

01:00:06.878 --> 01:00:10.578
- Turn around!
- Don't race. That's ridiculous.

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.246
All right, come on. Let's go.

01:00:13.342 --> 01:00:15.085
Put your window down!

01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:18.593
- He wants something.
- He's probably drunk.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.088
(Man) You're going the wrong way!

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:25.227
- What?
- You're going the wrong way!

01:00:27.313 --> 01:00:30.931
- He says we're going the wrong way.
- Oh, he's drunk.

01:00:31.025 --> 01:00:33.480
How would he know where we're going?

01:00:33.569 --> 01:00:35.608
Yeah, how would he know?

01:00:36.739 --> 01:00:39.194
Thank you. Thanks a lot. Terrific.

01:00:39.283 --> 01:00:41.240
Thank you.

01:00:41.326 --> 01:00:43.781
- (Honks horn)
- What a moron.

01:00:45.705 --> 01:00:48.278
You're going in the wrong direction!

01:00:52.878 --> 01:00:55.962
You're going to kill somebody!

01:01:04.347 --> 01:01:06.506
You're going the wrong way!

01:01:08.101 --> 01:01:09.761
(Horns blaring)

01:01:11.354 --> 01:01:13.679
- Truck. Truck.
- What?

01:01:15.149 --> 01:01:18.019
(Screaming)

01:01:21.863 --> 01:01:24.105

01:01:53.393 --> 01:01:55.848

(Honks horn)

01:02:16.372 --> 01:02:18.411
Well, this isn't so bad.

01:02:19.542 --> 01:02:22.792
I thought it'd be
a lot worse than this.

01:02:22.878 --> 01:02:25.120
They'll be able to buff this out.

01:02:25.214 --> 01:02:27.040
Oh, yeah.

01:02:29.718 --> 01:02:31.128
Wow!

01:02:33.763 --> 01:02:35.803
I mean, that was close.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:39.590
We can laugh about it now.
We're all right.

01:02:39.685 --> 01:02:41.844
The whole, uh...

01:02:43.731 --> 01:02:48.439
Maybe we should get my stuff off
the road? What do you think? Yeah.

01:02:48.527 --> 01:02:50.436
Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.320
Oh, my back!

01:02:54.407 --> 01:02:57.776
Ohh! God.

01:02:58.911 --> 01:03:00.951
(Groaning)

01:03:18.429 --> 01:03:20.386
Come on. Here we go.

01:03:21.516 --> 01:03:22.926
Thanks.

01:03:23.017 --> 01:03:25.389
Put it down for a second.

01:03:31.525 --> 01:03:34.146
(Neal) Whew. What a night.

01:03:34.236 --> 01:03:35.860
(Fire ignites)

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.857
(Glass tinkles)

01:04:27.577 --> 01:04:28.987
What?

01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:30.781
What?

01:04:31.747 --> 01:04:34.154
You finally did it to yourself.

01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:35.660
Huh?

01:04:38.336 --> 01:04:42.120
I mean, good luck
turning the car in.

01:04:42.215 --> 01:04:45.299
They'll be happy as pigs in shit
to see you.

01:04:55.477 --> 01:04:59.522
How could you rent the thing anyway
without a credit card?

01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:02.476
You couldn't. How could you do it?

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:07.027
I gave this gal behind the counter
a set of shower curtain rings.

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:18.947
You can't rent a car
with shower curtain rings.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:30.839
Well, uh...

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.003
somehow your, uh...

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:37.306
Diner's Club card
wound up in my wallet,

01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:40.308
- and I, uh, just...
- You stole it!

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:42.801
- Not exactly.
- You stole my card!

01:05:42.896 --> 01:05:44.520
I didn't!

01:05:44.606 --> 01:05:47.772
You stole my card,
rented a car and burned it!

01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:51.607
I found it in my wallet!
I thought you put it there.

01:05:52.613 --> 01:05:54.653
Why would I put it there?!

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.441
- Kindness?
- Kindness?

01:05:58.535 --> 01:06:01.702
Kindness? You stole it!

01:06:01.788 --> 01:06:03.615
He stole it!

01:06:03.707 --> 01:06:06.661
No, I was going
to send it back to you

01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:09.871
with whatever
the rental car charge was.

01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:13.663
You didn't give me your address!
You just ditched me.

01:06:13.758 --> 01:06:16.249
I had no money, no cards, nothing.

01:06:16.344 --> 01:06:18.383
- Give it back!
- I can't!

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.508
Why not?

01:06:21.598 --> 01:06:23.009
Because!

01:06:23.892 --> 01:06:25.517
Because why?

01:06:25.602 --> 01:06:30.180
Because when we stopped to gas up
I put the card back in your wallet.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.199
Are you mad at me?

01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:47.704
(Yells)

01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:52.915
(Rattling)

01:07:00.509 --> 01:07:03.593
You could've killed me,
slugging me in the gut.

01:07:05.931 --> 01:07:07.970
That's how Houdini died.

01:07:13.188 --> 01:07:15.061
Ow. Ah!

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:22.729
(Del) One good thing - with all this
fresh air, we'll sleep like babies.

01:07:22.822 --> 01:07:25.692
Neal? Hey, hey, Neal, wait up.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.533
I need one room.

01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:32.988
If you're pissed,
we should get separate rooms.

01:07:33.081 --> 01:07:36.035
- Get your own room.
- I need a credit card.

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:38.284
All right. All right.

01:07:41.088 --> 01:07:42.915
I have, uh...

01:07:43.716 --> 01:07:45.340
Diner's...

01:07:47.219 --> 01:07:51.347
Visa... and a gasoline card.

01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:55.927
(Receptionist) Uh... these aren't...

01:07:56.019 --> 01:07:57.762
uh, credit cards.

01:07:59.022 --> 01:08:02.556
- All right. I'll pay cash. Cash.
- 42.50.

01:08:10.157 --> 01:08:13.360
How about... $17?

01:08:14.744 --> 01:08:16.654
I can't do that.

01:08:16.746 --> 01:08:19.782
Please. Have mercy.

01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:24.367
I've been wearing
the same underwear since Tuesday.

01:08:24.462 --> 01:08:26.787
I can vouch for that.

01:08:28.966 --> 01:08:31.372
I don't... I don't own the place.

01:08:38.558 --> 01:08:42.305
$17 and a hell of a nice watch.

01:08:50.653 --> 01:08:52.692
Ouch.

01:08:57.283 --> 01:08:59.691
Um, would you like a room?

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:10.995
I got a slight problem here.
I don't have the 42.50.

01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:14.538
You have $17 and a good watch?

01:09:15.676 --> 01:09:17.715
No, I don't. I have, uh...

01:09:20.971 --> 01:09:23.428
I have $2 and, uh...

01:09:26.144 --> 01:09:27.970
and a Casio.

01:09:30.481 --> 01:09:34.063
Mm. I'm going to have to say
good night, so...

01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:27.364
Well, Marie, once again,
my dear, you were as right as rain.

01:10:29.827 --> 01:10:33.327
I am, without a doubt,
the biggest pain in the butt

01:10:33.414 --> 01:10:35.453
that ever came down the pike.

01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:42.209
I meet someone whose company
I really enjoy, and what do I do?

01:10:43.757 --> 01:10:45.796
I go overboard.

01:10:45.884 --> 01:10:47.960
I smother the poor soul.

01:10:48.053 --> 01:10:51.338
I cause him more trouble
than he has a right to.

01:10:54.058 --> 01:10:56.098
God, I got a big mouth.

01:10:57.937 --> 01:11:00.178
(Sighs)

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.689
When am I ever gonna wake up?

01:11:24.128 --> 01:11:27.331
I wish you were here with me
right now.

01:11:31.468 --> 01:11:35.168
But I guess...
that's not gonna happen.

01:11:36.848 --> 01:11:39.338
Not now, anyway.

01:11:41.352 --> 01:11:45.052
What did I do to get hooked up
with this guy?

01:12:03.205 --> 01:12:05.992
You're gonna
freeze to death out there.

01:12:12.839 --> 01:12:15.045
- How's your drink?
- It's good.

01:12:16.676 --> 01:12:18.550
Go for another one?

01:12:18.636 --> 01:12:20.463
Where you been?

01:12:20.555 --> 01:12:23.128
Ever been to Italy? You had Amaretto?

01:12:23.224 --> 01:12:27.766
Yeah. This is a gin.
Is there a tequila there?

01:12:27.853 --> 01:12:30.095
Ahem. A little Mexican trip.

01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:33.059
- Tequila?
- Here you go. Coming up.

01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:35.605
Is this a good combo or what?

01:12:35.694 --> 01:12:37.686
No. Probably not.

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:41.898
Me, I'm going back to, uh, Jamaica.

01:12:43.034 --> 01:12:47.161
(Bad Jamaican accent)
Jamaica, man. Have some rum, man.

01:12:47.246 --> 01:12:50.412
Dig it. Iree, iree, man.

01:12:52.876 --> 01:12:54.915
Oh, shit.

01:12:58.506 --> 01:13:03.298
You know, when I'm dead and buried,
all I'll have to prove I was here

01:13:03.386 --> 01:13:07.086
was some shower curtain rings
that didn't fall down.

01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:08.805
Great legacy, huh?

01:13:08.891 --> 01:13:12.888
At the very least,
at the absolute minimum,

01:13:12.978 --> 01:13:16.513
you've got a woman you love
to grow old with, right?

01:13:18.608 --> 01:13:20.648
You love her, don't you?

01:13:26.115 --> 01:13:30.528
Love is not a big enough word.

01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:34.320
It's not a big enough word
for how I feel about my wife.

01:13:34.414 --> 01:13:37.201
- To the wives.
- To the wives.

01:13:43.339 --> 01:13:45.379
Wow.

01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:50.210
Well, let me just
close this conversation

01:13:50.304 --> 01:13:53.258
by saying you are
one unique individual.

01:13:55.267 --> 01:13:58.600
What is unique? Latin for "asshole"?

01:13:59.646 --> 01:14:02.433
- Grab the vodka or I'll kick 'em.
- Yeah.

01:14:04.609 --> 01:14:06.317
Well, I'll tell you...

01:14:06.402 --> 01:14:10.815
As much trouble as I've had,
one day I'll look back and laugh.

01:14:10.906 --> 01:14:13.611
(Chuckling) You think so?

01:14:13.701 --> 01:14:16.156
Oh, I'm laughing already.

01:14:16.245 --> 01:14:17.822
(Del) Oh, God.

01:14:17.913 --> 01:14:19.787
When that car blew up.

01:14:19.873 --> 01:14:22.494
Was that seat hot or what?

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:27.625
I felt like a big Whopper.
Turn me over. I'm done on this side.

01:14:27.714 --> 01:14:32.956
I'm afraid to look at my ass,
I'll have griddle marks on my ass...

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:35.797
(Pop)

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:38.343
(Laughing) What is that?

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.673
(Laughing) Potato chips.

01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:44.678
They're everywhere!

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:46.265
Ahh!

01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:47.814
(Laughing)

01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:49.891
This feels like summer camp.

01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:53.982
(Laughing) Ahh!

01:14:58.909 --> 01:15:00.985
(Groaning with laughter)

01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:08.578
Now, how the hell does this turn off?

01:15:08.668 --> 01:15:11.503
Oh! (Laughing)

01:15:11.587 --> 01:15:12.583
- (Buzzing)
- (Del yells)

01:15:14.257 --> 01:15:16.000
(Neal) Just a minute.

01:15:16.092 --> 01:15:19.128
- Give it a good push.
- All right.

01:15:19.219 --> 01:15:21.378
- All right.
- Oh, jeez.

01:15:21.472 --> 01:15:23.511
(Engine revs)

01:15:26.726 --> 01:15:29.264
- Push! Push!
- I am! I am!

01:15:29.354 --> 01:15:32.023
(Del) Push, for Christ's sake!

01:15:32.106 --> 01:15:35.356
- We have to rock it.
- All right. OK.

01:15:35.443 --> 01:15:38.313
(Del) Up and down. Here we go. Ready?

01:15:38.404 --> 01:15:40.729
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

01:15:40.823 --> 01:15:43.444
Reverse!

01:15:50.081 --> 01:15:53.082
- Aww!
- Huh.

01:15:58.422 --> 01:16:00.047
Get in!

01:16:04.136 --> 01:16:05.547
Go!

(Neal) Oh.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.934
Oh, great. Great. A cop. Watch it!

01:17:09.196 --> 01:17:11.023
How fast are you going?

01:17:11.114 --> 01:17:13.985
I can't tell.
The speedometer's melted.

01:17:14.075 --> 01:17:17.325
(Del) Top of the morning, Officer.
(Neal) Hi.

01:17:17.412 --> 01:17:20.282
(Del) Is there something
I can help you with?

01:17:20.373 --> 01:17:25.200
- What the hell you driving?
- We had a small fire last night.

01:17:25.294 --> 01:17:27.963
You know how fast you were going?

01:17:28.047 --> 01:17:31.380
I was just talking
to my friend about that.

01:17:31.467 --> 01:17:36.673
Our speedometer's melted so it's very
hard to say how fast we were going.

01:17:36.763 --> 01:17:38.802
78 miles an hour.

01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:41.381
(Whistles) 78, huh?

01:17:41.476 --> 01:17:43.967
Well, yeah. I could buy that. Sure.

01:17:44.061 --> 01:17:48.273
You'd know better than us, specially
since we got a melted speedometer.

01:17:48.357 --> 01:17:51.856
Do you feel this vehicle
is safe for highway travel?

01:17:51.944 --> 01:17:54.695
Yes, I do. I really do.
I believe that...

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.480
It's not pretty but it'll
get you where you want to go.

01:17:58.575 --> 01:18:01.492
- You got no outside mirror.
- We lost that.

01:18:01.578 --> 01:18:05.112
- You have no functioning gauges.
- No, not a one.

01:18:05.206 --> 01:18:09.120
However, the radio still works,
funny as that may seem.

01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:11.665
The radio's the only thing
that's working.

01:18:11.754 --> 01:18:14.624
It's clear as a bell.
Don't ask me how.

01:18:16.508 --> 01:18:20.091
- I can't let you go in this vehicle.
- Can't what?

01:18:20.178 --> 01:18:22.005
It's not fit for the road.

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:25.880
It'll be impounded
until it can be made safe for travel.

01:18:25.975 --> 01:18:30.933
OK, Officer, I admit I broke the law,
and for that I'm really sorry.

01:18:31.021 --> 01:18:35.564
You got me there
and I won't argue one iota, I swear.

01:18:35.651 --> 01:18:37.939
However, um...

01:18:38.028 --> 01:18:40.067
if you impound our car,

01:18:40.155 --> 01:18:44.448
I'm gonna be unable to get my friend
home for his Thanksgiving dinner.

01:18:59.589 --> 01:19:01.629
(Lorry horn honking)

01:19:07.931 --> 01:19:10.552
(Honking)

01:19:15.146 --> 01:19:17.517
Well, our ship has come in.

01:19:23.195 --> 01:19:25.685
It's free, and it's non-stop.

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:29.694
- I said I'd get you home.
- So long as the heater works.

01:19:29.784 --> 01:19:34.244
The driver's a little freaky
about people riding in his cab.

01:19:35.247 --> 01:19:39.826
- So we can't sit there.
- Then where are we supposed to ride?

01:19:41.545 --> 01:19:43.584
Beats walking, huh?

01:19:45.048 --> 01:19:50.469
You're gonna be in Chicago in
less than three hours, around there.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:54.171
If we don't hit any traffic,
and I don't think we should.

01:19:54.265 --> 01:19:56.304
It's Thanksgiving.

01:19:56.851 --> 01:19:58.890
We're moving now.

01:20:31.549 --> 01:20:33.091
You believe this?

01:20:33.176 --> 01:20:36.379
- It's been a hell of a trip.
- Sure has.

01:20:36.471 --> 01:20:41.595
But, uh, after all's said and done,
you got me home and I appreciate it.

01:20:41.684 --> 01:20:44.720
Next time,
let's go first class, all right?

01:20:44.812 --> 01:20:49.189
- I hope there isn't a next time.
- I know what you mean!

01:20:49.274 --> 01:20:51.729
(Train approaching)

01:20:51.818 --> 01:20:53.811
This you?

01:20:55.655 --> 01:20:57.114
Yeah.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:05.074
It's been great meeting you.
Sorry if I caused any trouble.

01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:09.624
No, you didn't, you got me home,
and, uh... a little late...

01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:11.667
Coupla days.

01:21:11.753 --> 01:21:15.003
But, uh... I'm a little wiser,
too, so...

01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:16.797
Me, too.

01:21:18.384 --> 01:21:20.673
- Happy holidays.
- Same to you.

01:21:22.805 --> 01:21:26.589
Happy Thanksgiving, Neal.
Give my love to the family.

01:21:26.684 --> 01:21:31.226
- Maybe I'll meet them one day.
- Say hello to Marie for me.

01:21:31.313 --> 01:21:32.724
Yeah.

01:21:33.565 --> 01:21:35.189
So...

01:21:35.275 --> 01:21:36.685
OK.

01:21:36.776 --> 01:21:40.359
- And have a happy Thanksgiving.
- Hey, you know it.

01:21:40.446 --> 01:21:42.106
So long.

01:23:05.733 --> 01:23:08.022
I like... I like me.

01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:09.937
My wife likes me.

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:16.488
At the very least,
the absolute minimum,

01:23:16.577 --> 01:23:20.159
you've got a woman you love
to grow old with, right?

01:23:25.502 --> 01:23:27.992
I spend too much time away.

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:32.381
I haven't been home in years.
(Echoing)

01:23:58.365 --> 01:24:00.821
Del, what are you doing here?

01:24:07.165 --> 01:24:10.865
You said you were going home.
What are you doing here?

01:24:12.336 --> 01:24:14.578
I, uh...

01:24:16.757 --> 01:24:18.750
I don't have a home.

01:24:25.432 --> 01:24:27.887
Marie's been dead for eight years.

01:25:03.926 --> 01:25:07.294
Boy, you are one lucky guy, Neal.

01:25:07.387 --> 01:25:09.629
(Neal) I know.

01:25:11.599 --> 01:25:15.549
I won't stay long. Maybe I'll just
say hi, then I'll be on my way.

01:25:15.645 --> 01:25:17.472
Just come on.

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:30.065
