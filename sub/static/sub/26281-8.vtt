Our boy has
two spinal cords.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.526
It's called diastematomyelia.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.294
It's a congenital disorder
in which

12:41.361 --> 12:43.797
part of the spinal cord
is split in two.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.967
Congenital?
So he's had it since birth?

12:48.601 --> 12:49.903
Why didn't
anyone see it?

12:49.970 --> 12:52.339
It's rare, and with
no obvious symptoms,

12:52.405 --> 12:54.541
doctors generally
have no reason to look.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.877
The problem is,
when Finn hit puberty,

12:56.944 --> 12:59.046
the split spinal cords
rapidly stretched.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.348
The two strands got tethered
to his spinal canal,

13:01.414 --> 13:03.050
which led to the weakness
in his leg.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.153
As he grows, he's put
at risk for paraplegia.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.455
And we can go in
and untangle it.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.290
But anytime you're dealing
with the spinal cord,

13:10.357 --> 13:11.524
things can
get complicated.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.026
What are the dangers?

13:13.093 --> 13:14.694
He could
become quadriplegic,

13:14.761 --> 13:17.064
but the fact that he's
presenting with weakness
right now

13:17.130 --> 13:19.599
makes me think that
this is progressing rapidly.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.134
I don't think
we have a choice here.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.273

have an affair.

got through.

It's a memory test.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.821
Hopkins Verbal Learning,
COWA...

40:22.888 --> 40:26.057
These are memory tests.
Some of the questions
are harder.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.626
We are going to
do this right.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.427
Where did I
get my couch?

40:29.495 --> 40:31.096
(LAUGHING)
Okay, fine.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.132
You got your couch
from the bus you lived in
with your brother.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.469
Who gave me
my bookshelf?

40:37.536 --> 40:40.506
The town librarian,
Jennifer.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.073
And my lamp?

40:45.276 --> 40:46.645
Do you know?

40:46.712 --> 40:48.847
A teacher, Shannon.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.817
No, that's wrong.
Her name was Sheryl.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.151
What kind of
teacher was she?

40:53.218 --> 40:54.820
Sheryl, Shannon...
You never told me that.

40:54.886 --> 40:57.388
Yes, I did.
I'm pretty sure you did not.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.790
Oh.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.228
What's my brother's name?

41:03.294 --> 41:05.964
Oh, come on, Shaun.

41:06.532 --> 41:07.733
Really?

41:10.536 --> 41:13.905
This is stupid.
I know your brother's...

41:13.972 --> 41:16.407
**

41:24.550 --> 41:26.351
Your brother's name
is Sam.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.126
It's Steve.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.099
You're losing
your memory.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.771
**

41:54.145 --> 41:56.147
