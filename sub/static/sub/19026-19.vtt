00:05.320 --> 00:08.357
<i>Kylie and I still hadn't slept</i>
<i>together, but I had a feeling</i>

00:08.440 --> 00:11.113
<i>her four-week booty embargo</i>
<i>was about to end.</i>

00:11.200 --> 00:14.954
- I have a surprise for you tonight.
- <i>God, I hope it's sex. Or a pony.</i>

00:15.040 --> 00:17.838
<i>I'll bet it's sex</i>
<i>cos I don't see a pony.</i>

00:17.920 --> 00:19.478
Wait right here.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.998
It's for your scooter.
What are you doing?

00:25.320 --> 00:27.914
Nothing, I was just
gonna do a little laundry.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.230
I assume your facilities
are in-building?

00:30.320 --> 00:32.470
Why is it always
about sex with you?

00:32.560 --> 00:36.439
It's not. Look, Kylie,
I'm just really proud of my abs.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.715
Or ab.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.800
<i>Turk and Carla were having</i>
<i>relationship trouble,</i>

00:43.880 --> 00:45.279
<i>but they were working on it.</i>

00:45.360 --> 00:48.716
I don't understand why we
can't discuss this after <i>The A-Team.</i>

00:48.800 --> 00:51.598
A lot of married couples
hit roadblocks the first year,

00:51.680 --> 00:55.229
but nothing will be resolved if
we don't get our issues out in the open.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.470
OK, let's do this.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.633
- OK, what's bothering me...
- Hey, hey! There he is!

01:01.720 --> 01:04.313
- Did my buddy hit it and quit it?
- <i>Hell, no.</i>

01:04.400 --> 01:06.550
Hell, yes!

01:06.640 --> 01:08.995
Excuse me, it's time
for my nightly ritual.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.958
<i>Pleasure myself,</i>
<i>weep and repeat.</i>

01:12.040 --> 01:13.917
See, Turk? This is our problem.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.309
We're trying to have
a serious conversation,

01:16.400 --> 01:19.233
but you're more concerned
about your other wife.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.719
You know what bothers me?

01:20.800 --> 01:24.713
Everything with you becomes a big issue.
You make mountains out of molehills.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.156
When have I ever made
a mountain out of a molehill?

01:28.440 --> 01:31.955
Turk! If you can't remember to put
the cap on the toothpaste,

01:32.040 --> 01:34.031
how are we gonna raise our children?

01:34.120 --> 01:36.873
You know what?
I'm gonna stay with my sister.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.910
I guess I could
work on it a little.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.874
If the patient is in shock,
the first thing we do

01:43.960 --> 01:45.951
is assess intravascular volume...

01:46.560 --> 01:48.869
- What? That's right.
- Oh, I know.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.793
I wasn't "ahhing" you to indicate
an incorrect answer,

01:51.880 --> 01:55.316
I was "ahhing" because I was bored,
thought that might drive you crazy.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.358
You're a wonderful teacher.
Stop in front of my residents.

01:58.440 --> 02:01.671
- It's unprofessional.
- You're right, Barbie. Carry on.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.919
So when you're dealing
with cardiogenic shock...

02:08.199 --> 02:10.633
...it's best to start
fluid resuscitation...

02:12.720 --> 02:14.278
Let's keep moving.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.592
You know, I don't really appreciate
you messing with my lady.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.999
Your lady?

02:22.080 --> 02:24.196
Blonde doctor and I
will end up together.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.512
I'm talking house in the burbs, Volvo,
dog-fighting ring in the basement.

02:28.600 --> 02:32.195
I guess it wouldn't be the first time
the janitor got the girl.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.510
Oh, wait a minute.
Yes, it would.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.556
- You want to place a wager?
- I do,

02:36.640 --> 02:40.110
but I really have no need for a
cracked Thermos and two pounds of keys.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.031
How about my van for your Porsche?

02:42.120 --> 02:46.193
I suppose when I win, I could destroy
your vehicle and make you watch.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.998
- Bet.
- Bet.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.713
- Give me the details on Kylie.
- Dude, it was so naughty.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.872
We're kissing, and she's like,
"It's a little hot in here,"

02:55.960 --> 02:58.190
and she starts pulling down her skirt.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.352
<i>Oh, my God. I'm getting turned</i>
<i>on by my own fake story.</i>

03:02.720 --> 03:05.518
Damn you, ruptured spleen!
To be continued.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.478
<i>Thank God Turk left,</i>
<i>I can't think about sex anymore.</i>

03:08.560 --> 03:12.189
<i>Luckily for me, there isn't a whole lot</i>
<i>of temptation in a hospital.</i>

03:13.040 --> 03:14.712
Howdy, stranger.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.268
Do you still want me?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.191
Yes, please.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.519
Hey, stranger.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.193
Ouch.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:45.240 --> 03:48.596
<i>So Molly's back in town.</i>
<i>She definitely wants me.</i>

03:48.680 --> 03:50.591
Bye. How you doing, J. J?

03:50.680 --> 03:52.159
It's J.D.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.196
Thinking of that Jimmie Walker sitcom.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.397
- <i>Good Times?</i>
- No. My sister had a miscarriage.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.749
Molly?

04:01.920 --> 04:03.592
- You look fantastic.
- So do you.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.274
- How's Milwaukee?
- OK. I'm here to see a patient.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.989
<i>Even though she did the fake "forget</i>
<i>my name" thing, she's here for me.</i>

04:10.080 --> 04:13.231
- <i>I think we know there's no patient.</i>
- They've landed!

04:13.320 --> 04:16.039
Grab blankets and all
the canned goods you can carry.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.519
We're moving to the sewers.

04:18.680 --> 04:22.229
He's really possessive of me.
He won't talk to the new psychiatrist.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.231
I'm sure he's not that possessive.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.550
Get away from my doctor!

04:26.880 --> 04:29.678
- Get him off! Get him off!
- Patrick, down.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.951
It is so good to laugh
like this with you again.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.316
I'm on a break here. Tell your
shiny-headed roommate to shut up,

04:39.400 --> 04:42.551
or his first surgery will be removing
a cell phone from his ass.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.676
Give him a break. It's his wife.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.389
Anybody seen Mr Jennings file?
Oh, here it is.

04:48.480 --> 04:51.074
This just got interesting.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.194
- Who are you talking to?
- Rosanna.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.111
- Your college girlfriend?
- Yeah.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.997
- Could I say hi?
- Yeah.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.113
- Hey, Rosanna.
- <i>Hi, J.D.</i>

05:00.200 --> 05:01.599
Dude, what the hell?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.750
<i>Hello?</i>

05:05.360 --> 05:08.158
- <i>Hello? J.D.?</i>
- This phone is indestructible.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.037
If it has a camera,
I'm so getting one.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.394
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

05:11.960 --> 05:13.234
Dude!

05:13.320 --> 05:15.038
Why are you talking to her?

05:15.120 --> 05:17.350
We're just friends!

05:17.440 --> 05:18.714
Just friends.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.076
I was just friends once
with a Vietnamese girl.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.436
Long story short, I'm sending
Trong Tri Kelso to college.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.476
He doesn't want to go to a state school.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.996
Unlike you, Bobbo, Gandhi here
is in a healthy relationship.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.755
I mean, come on, even Jordan lets me
keep in touch with women from my past.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.353
Give me a pound, my dog.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.749
- He gets me.
- Give me a pound, dog.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.994
Does he know you
were being sarcastic?

05:44.080 --> 05:46.230
- I hope not.
- Splendid.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.879
Gentlemen, Crazy Eyes Margo,
I've called us together for one reason.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.474
I have to find a way to make
blonde doctor mine.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.834
Burn down her apartment.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.912
I have an idea,
but we're gonna need a tugboat.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.798
Tugboats and arson.
That's all I ever get from you guys.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.759
We call this a brain trust,
and I'm the one with all the solutions.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.150
I saved you from that eagle, Randall.
I saved your job, Troy.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.549
And, Margo,
I found your birth mother.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.915
She was a tree person, remember?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.672
There's no shame in that.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.357
I'm sorry, guys, but I've had enough.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.556
I'm afraid I have to find
a new brain trust.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.473
Gentlemen...

06:23.560 --> 06:25.471
...I don't want to appear selfish,

06:25.560 --> 06:27.949
but stop what you're doing
and focus on me.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.078
So you seeing anyone?

06:31.160 --> 06:34.436
I went out with a guy named Rick.
Then he met my mom, and it fell apart.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.670
- She didn't like him?
- No. She loved him.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.829
They're in Aruba.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.717
God, I'd love to get with Molly.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.951
You're pretty horny for a guy
who gets it on a nightly basis.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.634
- What are you implying?
- Let's say a birdie told me

06:45.720 --> 06:47.995
- you and Kylie haven't slept together.
- Who?

06:48.080 --> 06:51.038
- Nurse Birdie.
- Well, you haven't.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.839
- I trusted you.
- Dude, it's been a month.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.399
Really? Has it been a month?

06:55.480 --> 06:59.632
Time just flies when you're dry-humping
your way through three pairs of cords.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.119
She hasn't slept with you.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.112
She doesn't want to be exclusive.
Is she dating?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.555
She did go to a movie
with her brother-in-law.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.154
Perfect. You can
have your cake and eat it too.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.471
It's like me talking with Rosanna.
It boosts my self-esteem,

07:12.560 --> 07:14.790
and I take the positive energy
back to Carla.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.634
This is what you do. Go out with Molly,
have a great time while she's in town,

07:18.720 --> 07:22.633
but once she leaves, you go to Kylie
and tell her you want to get exclusive.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.359
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.273
Once you got the hole
in the bottom of the popcorn box,

07:28.360 --> 07:30.430
it's basically
just a waiting game.

07:30.520 --> 07:34.308
And for the record, that technique
does not work with hot nachos.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.790
You want to get Elliot,
get in good with her best friend.

07:37.880 --> 07:38.949
Who's Elliot?

07:42.320 --> 07:44.436
- Oh.
- Trust me.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.795
The way I got my girlfriend
in junior high

07:46.880 --> 07:49.030
was by getting her
best friend to like me.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.439
And how'd you do that?

07:50.520 --> 07:53.592
Oh, I posed as her dad
so she could rent a car.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.553
I lost my hair
in eighth grade.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.551
Tough break five.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.514
I'm going in.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.149
Um, we should be friends.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.198
- OK.
- Do you like "vanning"?

08:14.280 --> 08:16.874
- I don't know what that is.
- It's kind of my thing.

08:16.960 --> 08:20.748
It's like taking a long drive
in a car, only it's in a van.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.832
- I'm still not getting it.
- Can you hold on for one sec?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.953
She's an idiot.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.508
Turk, I found
your cell phone in the parking lot.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.798
Four stories and not a scratch.
What are you made of?

08:36.880 --> 08:40.589
You got three missed phone calls,
all from a "Rosanna."

08:40.679 --> 08:43.477
Isn't that your ex-girlfriend?

08:45.600 --> 08:48.319
- What's been going on?
- I went to India for two weeks.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.995
Ladies, this is a hospital, not
the Junior League. Let's break it up.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.595
Dr Clock, I feel as though
I've seen less of you recently.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.434
We don't pay you to go hide in your
office. Get out there on the floor.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.717
- I moved to Milwaukee four months ago.
- Welcome back.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.471
This trip to India sounds so exotic.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.518
Hey, Kylie, I'm just calling
to see how your day is going.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.955
Sweat would be
dripping off our naked bodies.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.433
Naked sweat drips.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.158
- What?
- Oh, nothing, Kylie.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.993
It's a new band called
The Naked Sweat Drips.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.833
They have a great song
called <i>Perfect Breasts.</i>

09:21.920 --> 09:25.196
And then I got so flexible,
I could put my legs behind my head.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.669
- J.D., are you there?
- You should come.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.150
Frick on a stick. I gotta go.
I want to hear the rest. Don't forget.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.037
Feet up behind her head.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.997
Who has their feet
behind their head?

09:35.080 --> 09:37.389
A patient, Kylie.
Horrible car accident.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.233
You have to wear your seat belt,
even around the block.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.312
Hey. I'm getting out of here.
Do you want to grab a beer?

09:43.400 --> 09:46.710
<i>They say the best laid plans</i>
<i>of mice and men often go awry.</i>

09:46.800 --> 09:49.030
I can't believe
you've been talking to her.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.270
Now, honey, is it possible

09:51.360 --> 09:54.636
you're making mountains
out of molehills?

09:55.600 --> 09:56.919
Damn it.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.833
<i>Sometimes plans go</i>
<i>exactly like they're supposed to.</i>

10:00.280 --> 10:02.316
- You paged me?
- Yeah, look.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.073
I made a bet with Dr Cox
that you would go out with me.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.071
And if I win,
I get his Porsche.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.790
<i>And the success of those plans can take</i>
<i>even the most hardened men by surprise.</i>

10:13.960 --> 10:18.351
Do you mind? I am trying
to have a private moment with my man.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.350
Oh, God.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.793
- I got lipstick on you.
- No. Leave it.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.800
<i>And sometimes even</i>
<i>the best of men can go awry.</i>

10:33.880 --> 10:35.836
So are you coming over tonight?

10:36.680 --> 10:41.037
- Hey, J.D.
- Try that cake I was telling you about.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.269
Actually, Kylie, I... I can't tonight.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.597
<i>If having my cake and eating it too</i>
<i>meant being with Molly,</i>

10:53.680 --> 10:56.148
- <i>then nothing would get between us.</i>
- Going out?

10:56.240 --> 10:59.198
- Yeah, you should come with us!
- That's the close button.

10:59.280 --> 11:03.512
No, it's a close button. When someone
gets close, a sensor opens the door.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.874
Fancy.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.433
<i>She's got a pinkie hold.</i>

11:07.520 --> 11:11.069
<i>Elliot's got the finger strength</i>
<i>of a rock-climbing jazz pianist.</i>

11:13.920 --> 11:16.639
You're pressing the wrong button.

11:18.760 --> 11:22.435
- I'm so excited. So where are we going?
- We haven't decided yet!

11:23.080 --> 11:25.514
I gotta tell you there, supercuts,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.875
I've seen crazy things
at this hospital.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.190
I've seen smokers live to be 100

11:30.280 --> 11:32.953
and triathletes come in
and drop dead at 20.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.031
I've seen unbridled joy,

11:35.120 --> 11:36.951
and I've seen
debilitating pain.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.510
But I never thought I'd see
a jump-suit-wearing,

11:40.600 --> 11:43.433
van-driving, vomit-cleaning,
no-good, confounded,

11:43.520 --> 11:47.752
Frankenstein-looking buffoon
like you get a girl like Barbie.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.469
I'm gonna paint your Porsche mint
green so it looks like my van's baby.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.556
Rosanna gets her own
personal ringtone, but I don't?

12:06.640 --> 12:08.392
Baby, I don't
have to answer this.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.392
It's cool. I got the ring
that matters, right?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.353
Nurse, I want to talk
to you about these discharge...

12:18.000 --> 12:19.069
We can talk later.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.713
- You need to come get a drink.
- Yes, I do.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.274
Janitor.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.555
So did Dr Cox pay up?

12:28.640 --> 12:31.598
Uh, no. No.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.036
He says that he needs to
see us on an actual date

12:35.120 --> 12:37.031
in a restaurant tonight at 8.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.315
OK. Meet me at Stanwyck's?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.118
- Sure.
- OK.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.193
Sorry, guys, can't go clubbing tonight.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.236
Daddy's got a date.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.276
Oh, man!

12:54.360 --> 12:57.113
I ironed my going-out hair!

13:01.800 --> 13:04.712
They make thongs
specifically for low riders now.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.917
They don't work. I can't sit
without showing my ass crack.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.878
- One night, some guy put a pen in it.
- <i>Some guy?</i>

13:10.960 --> 13:12.837
<i>I never get credit for anything.</i>

13:12.920 --> 13:15.673
You guys think I'm
overreacting about Turk?

13:15.760 --> 13:17.478
Calls from an ex
would drive me nuts.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.199
<i>I knew how to get rid of them,</i>
<i>but I can't do that to Turk.</i>

13:20.280 --> 13:23.875
- <i>If you don't do it, I will.</i>
- <i>Mr Peeps? Why are you British?</i>

13:23.960 --> 13:26.872
<i>I'll explain later.</i>
<i>Just lose the extra bitches.</i>

13:26.960 --> 13:29.394
Carla. Go talk to Turk.

13:29.480 --> 13:32.119
Share with him your feelings.
That's what he wants.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.077
- Yeah?
- Come on. I'll drive you.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.071
I gotta go to dinner anyway.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.869
<i>You're welcome.</i>

13:39.960 --> 13:41.598
We should go too. It's late.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.750
Oh, no, no, no.
I just ordered two drinks.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.717
Here they are.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.594
Hey, Turk?

13:48.680 --> 13:50.750
I promise I will visit you soon.

13:52.680 --> 13:56.639
Look, I don't care if I seem crazy.
Please stop talking to your ex.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.836
Anything for you,
you know that.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.233
College was weird.
I was worried about being liked,

14:08.320 --> 14:11.073
so I let my roommate think we
were dating for three months.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.310
We broke up at her sorority formal.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.995
Oh, nobody could snuggle like Daisy.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.991
Did you say Dr Cox was coming at 8?

14:19.080 --> 14:20.832
Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.997
I kissed a dude once.
It was at furnace camp.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.671
<i>You're a little drunk, and you know</i>
<i>what happens when you get drunk.</i>

14:35.760 --> 14:38.399
<i>You get "handsy".</i>
<i>Now control yourself.</i>

14:38.480 --> 14:40.755
It's tough making
new friends in Milwaukee.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.516
<i>I said control yourself!</i>

14:44.800 --> 14:48.031
If people aren't getting to know you,
they're missing out.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.873
- Do you think so?
- I do.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.393
<i>I knew what would happen</i>

14:52.480 --> 14:55.313
<i>if I reached over and brushed</i>
<i>the hair out of her eyes.</i>

15:28.080 --> 15:29.559
<i>But I didn't do that.</i>

15:29.640 --> 15:31.437
I should get going.

15:33.560 --> 15:34.913
I'm sorry.

15:44.160 --> 15:48.199
Well, if it isn't
Marginally Attractive and the Beast.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.838
How did the Porsche drive?

15:49.920 --> 15:53.356
Wait, why did we just go out
if you already have his car?

15:53.440 --> 15:55.795
Oh, my goodness.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.075
He actually tricked you into a date.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.072
This is so very delicious
and filling,

16:01.160 --> 16:03.754
I don't think I can
eat the rest of the evening.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.709
I honestly don't think I can have one
more bite of your painful humiliation.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.108
I find I'm just a little stuffed.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.077
I will take my keys to go, though.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.358
You're unbelievable.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.716
You're the only one around here
that treats me like a real person.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.478
What did you just say?

16:27.400 --> 16:30.597
There was one other girl
a few years ago. Red-haired doctor.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.558
She ate lunch with me until
the residents made fun of her.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.996
They called her "janitor lunch-eater".

16:37.080 --> 16:38.877
Not the most clever group.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.871
Anyway,

16:40.960 --> 16:44.077
I know you don't think about me
the way that I think about you,

16:44.160 --> 16:47.709
and I never really believed
that you would or that you could.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.588
But just pretending
for today somehow

16:51.680 --> 16:54.558
made me feel good for a change.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.752
I'm sorry.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.840
You know what? It's OK.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.990
I actually had a good time.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.948
Thanks.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.558
Elliot.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.760
Kylie, I'm sorry.
I hope it's OK that I stopped by.

17:21.920 --> 17:22.909
What was that for?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.470
I was thinking about how patient
you've been, how right things feel.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.835
Then you showed up,
and it feels like fate.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.434
Wait, are you saying
that you're ready?

17:32.880 --> 17:34.313
Awesome.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.958
First, let me set the mood.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.918
You're right, it is fate.
I was out with this girl tonight

17:43.000 --> 17:46.151
that I could have had sex with,
but it was easy to blow her off.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.629
I was excited to be with you.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.076
Why have you stopped
lighting incense?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.628
It makes the room
smell like Chinese rain.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.837
You blew me off tonight
to be with some random girl?

17:57.920 --> 18:01.151
She's not a random girl. I had
a crush on her long before I met you.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.629
<i>I will kill you.</i>

18:03.720 --> 18:05.278
You should go.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.148
<i>I was in trouble. If I didn't play my</i>
<i>cards right, I knew what could happen.</i>

18:36.800 --> 18:39.314
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>that's what did happen.</i>

18:39.400 --> 18:43.029
<i>See, that's the thing about trying</i>
<i>to have your cake and eating it, too.</i>

18:44.040 --> 18:47.589
<i>If you make the slightest mistake,</i>
<i>you wind up getting neither.</i>

18:53.400 --> 18:55.072
We can fix that.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.073
You guys are out.
You guys are back in. Where's Margo?

19:07.160 --> 19:09.469
At a Ludacris concert
with her birth mom.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.472
I lose my van to him,
and I lose Margo to gangster rap.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.357
Bad day.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.516
<i>Who wants to risk something important</i>
<i>just for a silly piece of cake?</i>

19:22.600 --> 19:23.999
I did it.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.833
Cut off all ties
with Rosanna. Forever.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.515
Baby, that took, like, 20 seconds.
How'd you do that so quickly?

19:30.600 --> 19:32.556
It was easy. I told her I was married.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.159
You've been talking
to a girl you used to sleep with,

19:36.240 --> 19:38.549
and you never told her
you were married?

19:38.640 --> 19:41.074
She never asked.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.151
It's no big deal.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.949
Because if you're lucky, maybe you
won't be married for much longer.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.190
Baby. Baby!
