12:09.600 --> 12:11.500
but the Town Car's waiting
to take me to the game.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.600
Thanks for the tickets, Fras.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.600
Fergie.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.200
Your meatloaf sandwich, sir.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.700
And your finger.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.000
- I hope you don't mind, sir.
FRASIER: Not at all.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.400
[DOORBELL RINGS]

12:32.700 --> 12:35.300
Ferguson, positions.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.800
Oh, Niles, what are you doing here?

12:39.100 --> 12:40.700
Don't panic.
I'm not crashing your party.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm here to pick up Daphne.
We're going to the mall.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.700
Really?

12:44.900 --> 12:47.100
Well, no chance
of running into Mel there.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.100
Should be a night to remember. We're
going someplace called The Limited.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.700
Well, Daphne,
why aren't you dressed?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.800
I'm not sure if I'm up
to going out tonight.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.200
I really hate all this sneaking around.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.200
It's not sneaking around.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.900
We're gonna be out in public
at the Tacoma Mall.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.000
And the most important thing
is we'll be together.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.000
All right. I suppose
that really is what matters.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.400
NILES: Now, tell me again,
what are we going to eat?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
DAPHNE: Curly fries.
NILES: Ooh.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.700
[DOORBELL RINGS]

13:21.400 --> 13:23.500
Good evening, and welcome
to the home of Dr. Frasier...

13:23.800 --> 13:25.600
FRASIER:
Oh, save it. It's just Roz.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.600
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, your gift wrapping came in.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.200
I thought I just ordered a few.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.000
You were more generous
than you thought.

13:34.300 --> 13:35.900
FERGUSON: I'll put it in your room, sir.
- Yeah.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
You look like a gift giver.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
Roz, you put it in my room.
He's working.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.400
[DOORBELL RINGS]

13:43.600 --> 13:46.600
Alan Murchie, lovely to see you.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.800
Likewise.
I don't think you've met my wife, Diane.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.100
<i>Enchanté.</i>

13:51.200 --> 13:53.500
And this is Henry Worth,
another board member.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.500
Henry. Lovely to meet you.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.200
FERGUSON: May I take your coats?
- Oh, thank you.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.900
Yeah.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.100
Frasier, isn't that
the colonel's old butler?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.800
Yes, Ferguson.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.600
My sense of duty compelled me
to take him in

14:06.800 --> 14:07.900
after the colonel passed.

14:08.100 --> 14:12.500
Yes. We felt the same sense of duty
toward his art collection.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.700
Oh, that's very droll.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.000
Excuse me.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.300
- Collection. And the Family Pak
really is your best value.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.400
Roz, Roz, what are you doing
out here?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.700
I'm sure Mr. Worth
isn't interested in gift wrapping.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.500
Nonsense. She's delightful.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.100
Now, what kind of deal
would you give me

14:31.400 --> 14:33.200
if I bought a hundred rolls?

14:33.500 --> 14:34.600
I'd take off 20 percent.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.800
And what would you take off
if I bought 5000 rolls?

14:41.400 --> 14:43.000
Everything but my bracelets.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.900
[LAUGHING]

14:45.100 --> 14:47.900
Yes, sir.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.200
Ah! Ted and Lois.
Oh, please, come in.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.400
I hope you don't mind, but we had
an extra ticket, so we brought a friend.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.700
Well, of course.
The more the merrier.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.700
Good evening, Frasier.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.100
Mel, what a delightful surprise.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.200
I had no idea you knew the Fishers.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.600
Niles, look who's here.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.800
- Darling.
MEL: Niles.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.300
I didn't think I'd see you here tonight.
I thought you were working late.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.500
Oh, lucky me.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.300
No. Lucky me.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.000
Lucky all of us.
Please, won't you sit down?

15:29.600 --> 15:31.500
What are you doing here?

15:31.800 --> 15:34.000
Look, I didn't know
we were stopping by here on our way,

15:34.300 --> 15:36.100
so just put on your party face
and deal with it.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.000
Well, I'm sorry, I have plans.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.700
Yes, you do.
To be by your wife's side.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.300
Everybody good? Everybody happy?

15:42.400 --> 15:45.000
Let's try to respect the feelings
and long-held dreams of others.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.700
Don't worry, Frasier,
everything's going to be fine.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.800
Fine? Fine for whom?
Is that code? What does that mean?

15:53.300 --> 15:55.500
Daphne, Daphne, I'm so sorry.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.700
Listen, this party can't last more
than an hour,

15:57.900 --> 16:00.900
and after that, we'll have
the whole evening together. I promise.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.200
Please, don't make any more promises
you can't keep.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.700
Oh, Niles, come over here
and listen to Ted's funny joke

16:06.000 --> 16:07.600
about Communists and heaven.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.800
Oh, I'm laughing already.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.100
- Frasier, this party is a triumph.
- Oh, well...

16:15.400 --> 16:18.600
I shouldn't be telling you this,
but if my straw poll is any indication,

16:18.800 --> 16:21.200
we may be seeing you
at the next board meeting.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.500
Oh, well, I hope you don't think
that's why I did this.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.900
But it's certainly
a nice fringe benefit.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.000
I'm no farmer, Crane,
but I can smell manure a mile away.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.400
You'll be a welcome addition.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.800
Oh, Ferguson. Ferguson, listen.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.700
Make sure
that everyone has a champagne.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.500
I have a little toast in mind
that I daresay will seal the deal.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.600
By the by, don't make any plans
for New Year's Eve.

16:50.900 --> 16:53.500
Lo and I are having a blowout
at our Mercer Island place.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.700
Well, that's a very generous offer,
but...

16:55.900 --> 16:57.000
Oh, we'd love to.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.000
It'll give me a chance to wear
that new Valentino

17:00.300 --> 17:02.600
- I might be getting for Christmas.
- Miss Moon?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.800
Mel, may I see you for a moment?

17:06.099 --> 17:07.500
- Well, actually, l...
- No, thank you.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.599
Excuse us.
Excuse us just one second.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.800
New Year's Eve with you?
Are you out of your mind?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.099
Keep your voice down.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.700
Look, I have gone along
with this charade because I hurt you,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.099
but now you're just dragging it out
to be vindictive.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.700
- I'm not gonna tolerate it any longer.
- What're you gonna do about it?

17:22.900 --> 17:25.400
- Keep pushing me, you'll find out.
- Don't threaten me.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.600
You made a promise,
and you're going to keep it.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.500
Your wrap, madam.
Dr. Crane thanks you for coming.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.300
Ferguson, Ferguson,
what in blue blazes are you doing?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.400
Perhaps to spare you
some embarrassment, sir,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.200
- I took the liberty...
- Stop.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.700
You've been taking far too much liberty
with the liberty-taking. Please.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.700
Just see that everyone
has some champagne.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.300
Yes, sir.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.100
There's no need to leave.
I would like to propose a toast.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.100
NILES: No, Mel, why don't you listen
for once? I'm through.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.600
MEL: I'll tell you when
you're through, you spineless twit,

17:53.900 --> 17:55.100
and you're not even close!

17:55.300 --> 17:57.900
Opera time! Opera time!

17:58.600 --> 17:59.900
On to the show.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.300
That's it, Mel.
I'm sick of these games.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.800
- Niles, don't make a scene.
- I don't care.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.300
I love Daphne and I'm not putting her
through this torture another second.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.000
This sham of a marriage is over.

18:15.400 --> 18:19.100
It's all right, dear. We've known
for some time he doesn't deserve you.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.800
Well, you've seen
what I have to put up with.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.900
I've tried so hard. I really have.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.200
I don't know how you've put up
with him this long.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.800
- I just want out.
- Don't worry.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I'll handle the divorce papers
personally.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.300
This jackass will be out of your life
by the end of the week.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.100
You mean it?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.200
See you around, Crane.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.600
I love you too.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.200
Oh, come on, Frasier,
you don't wanna spend the evening

18:49.500 --> 18:50.600
with those snobs anyway.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.700
Yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.400
- Coming, Roz?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.300
I'm just getting an early start
on the candy drive.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.200
Frasier, I'm sorry
I ruined your evening.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.100
That's all right, Niles.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.400
It's a small price to pay
to finally see you and Daphne together.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.700
It's true. We're free. No more hiding.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Where do you wanna go?
Dinner? Dancing? London? Paris?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.100
Why don't we go for a walk?

19:25.100 --> 19:28.600
- Even better.
FERGUSON: If you'll allow me.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.800
- Thank you, Ferguson.
FERGUSON: My pleasure, sir.

19:36.700 --> 19:40.400
- Thank you, Ferguson.
- It was my privilege, Ms. Moon.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.600
All right, Ferguson, we've got
some fences to mend with the board.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
What do we send,
and to whom do we send it?

19:56.800 --> 20:00.900
Actually, sir, I regret to inform you
that I must tender my resignation.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.500
Please, don't be upset
things didn't go well this evening.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.300
I'll make it up to you.
Send yourself something.

20:09.900 --> 20:13.000
Thank you, sir, but it's not you.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.100
It was your brother and Ms. Moon.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.600
His willingness
to break social rank has inspired me.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.300
And there' a certain Lady Westerfield
whose acquaintance I'd like to renew.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.800
Ah. True love and all that.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.700
Well, good luck, Ferguson.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.100
Thank you, sir.

20:35.300 --> 20:39.700
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I had rather a difficult evening.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.700
Think I'll just go take a sad soak
in the tub.

20:44.800 --> 20:50.300
Sir, after such an evening, it's not right
for a man to draw his own bath,

20:50.600 --> 20:54.500
so if I may take the liberty...

20:56.500 --> 20:58.700
Carry on, Ferguson.
