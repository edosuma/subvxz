01:07.150 --> 01:08.902
It's fucking great to see you again.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.779
Same here, boss.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.532
-How's it going, Pollito?
-It took you long enough, Joaquín.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.493
Better late than never, bro.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.162
Nobody can stop me now.

<i>Three years after his</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:45.104
<i>Mexico is shaken</i>
<i>by news of Guzmán Loera's escape...</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:48.108
<i>He was captured in 1993 in Guatemala</i>

01:48.191 --> 01:50.568
<i>and imprisoned</i>
<i>in Almoloya Penitentiary, in Juárez.</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:54.030
<i>...has been arrested for the</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:57.742
<i>Chapo Guzmán's escape complicates</i>

<i>and the United States.</i>

01:59.244 --> 02:02.997
<i>At 9:15 on the night of January 19,</i>
<i>he was accounted for.</i>

02:03.081 --> 02:05.083
It is believed that he escaped

02:05.166 --> 02:07.210
<i>through the laundry room.</i>

02:07.293 --> 02:08.586
<i>A serious development,</i>

02:08.670 --> 02:11.798

02:19.806 --> 02:23.768
<i>Apparently, he escaped in a cart</i>

02:24.185 --> 02:26.771
<i>Chapo Guzmán was accounted for</i>

02:26.855 --> 02:28.606
<i>-on January 19, 2001...</i>
-That bastard...

02:28.690 --> 02:30.817
will want revenge.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.778
He couldn't take us down before,
he won't be able to now.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.324
That bastard is a fugitive,

Joaquín, everything's changed
since you got locked up.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.860
Players may change, Arturo,
but the game stays the same.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.076
Chente.

04:13.336 --> 04:17.298
-What the fuck, Arturo?
-Easy, man, it's just a meeting.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.133
Make yourselves at home, have a seat.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.904
I apologize for not
letting you know I'd be coming.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.783
It's been chaotic,
and I didn't want to make it worse.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.705
I called this meeting
because we all have a common enemy...

04:51.040 --> 04:52.625
the Avendaño brothers.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.798
I'd like to create a federation,
like in the old days,

05:00.925 --> 05:04.053
and work together under the same command.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.430
Yours?

05:08.975 --> 05:09.976
Mine.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.814
If I can escape prison,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.025
I can definitely kill the Avendaños.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.987
Peace and profit for all of us.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.908
And a new deal with the government.

In case you want to write back, sir.

11:36.779 --> 11:41.575
DON'T GET USED TO IT, GÜERITO.
I WON'T BE HERE LONG.

MEXICO CITY
MEXICO

12:08.227 --> 12:09.770
What does Joaquín want now?

12:10.855 --> 12:12.148
To talk about his sentence.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.192
Twenty years is too long, sir.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.290
Joaquín is willing
to give you these if you help him.

12:35.963 --> 12:39.842
Transferring him is one thing,
setting him free is much different.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.596
The press would know we worked together.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.350
Money can make anything possible.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.395
My client knows you're
interested in a political career.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.690
This will help you get there.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.401
Precisely because of my political career,

12:58.068 --> 13:00.279
I can't accept this.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.908
Tell him I'm sorry.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.161
He'll have to serve out his sentence.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.927
If not through Mr. Sol...

13:23.010 --> 13:26.305
I'll find a different way,
but I won't stay here for 20 years.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.140
The way I see it,

13:29.391 --> 13:31.018
the only other option is to escape.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.062
It's not like I don't want to.

13:33.562 --> 13:37.358
But if I escape, I'll be a fugitive,
I'll never stop running.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.442
True.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.528
I'll get out of here legally, Güero,

13:41.820 --> 13:42.821
but first things first.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.658
I have to wait for a better opportunity.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.287
Who are you and what
have you done to my friend?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.915
Almoloya taught you to be patient?

13:57.419 --> 13:59.046
What about you?

13:59.129 --> 14:02.383
-Did Amado really turn you in?
-My plane crashed...

14:03.717 --> 14:05.761
and that fucker told the army
my exact location.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.514
We're locked up because of that asshole.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.268
And the Avendaño roam free.

On the ground!

16:04.964 --> 16:06.298
Run, run!

JUÁREZ CITY
CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO

16:53.887 --> 16:55.681
This is getting out of hand, Amado.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.267
You're losing control.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.852
No fucking way.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.939
The Avendaños caught me in DF.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.649
They can't get me anywhere else.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.151
It's not just them.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.654
You let the other bosses get too powerful.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.198
And not everyone sees you as their leader.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.880
It's their funeral.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.133
My people and I are standing strong...

17:32.509 --> 17:34.136
here in Juárez.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.679
Isn't that right, Chente?

17:35.763 --> 17:38.348
Only Tijuana or Sinaloa
would be a challenge for us right now,

17:38.974 --> 17:40.684
and Ismael has shown us we can trust him.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.811
He's with us against the Avendaños.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.105
And Raciel and the Golfo Cartel?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.190
Don't worry about them.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.984
They're on the other side.
We never cross paths.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.661
Don't worry, Conrado.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.915
I've got this under control, am I right?

18:06.001 --> 18:07.461
Look, Joaquín...

18:08.003 --> 18:09.338
This is Fontanero,

18:09.505 --> 18:12.049
a very useful man.
He'll help you with whatever you need.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.926
Anything you need, you let me know.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.928
Nice to meet you.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.356
Can we buy them?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.611
I've never asked them for a big favor,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.739
but they're coming around with small ones.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.699
If I can't be free,

18:39.243 --> 18:41.078
I want to have a good time in here.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.829
Any news from Mr. Cheto?

19:23.912 --> 19:26.290
Los Angeles keeps getting more profitable.

19:28.709 --> 19:32.629
The Bernal Leyda brothers
are doing a good job, too.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.840
These are their numbers.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.633
Güero and you can rest easy.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.553
They'll take care of your business
for as long as you want.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.765
Thanks for the bread, my friend.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.042
Your time's up.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.221
I think I still got 20 minutes left.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.377
This is very dangerous.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.964
Why do something so stupid?

20:57.547 --> 20:59.466
It's fine, bro. I'm healthy as a horse.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.678
-Right, doc?
-You're fine, sir.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.805
Why bother undergoing
plastic surgery, man?

21:04.888 --> 21:07.307
Because I want to eat seafood

21:07.391 --> 21:10.310
without having to watch
over my fucking shoulder all the time.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.605
What's the point of having it all
if I can't enjoy it?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.984
You worry about keeping
the Avendaños in line.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.027
I won't be gone for long.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.616
-Babe.
-Darling.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.370
-How are you, son?
-Good.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.332
Look at you!

21:36.169 --> 21:37.170
How has my son been?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.339
He's been misbehaving.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.883
His teacher has scolded him
several times 'cause he can't stay still.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.094
As soon as I'm free,
I'll set him straight.

21:45.971 --> 21:46.805
Hey, Dad.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.558
How long until you come home?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.146
Less than when I got here.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.484
Look.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.872
Thanks.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.292
You've got everything you need, right?

22:17.419 --> 22:18.587
Except you.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.907
We needed this, right?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.540
I'll find a way to see you more often.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.459
Don't get into trouble.

22:59.169 --> 23:02.172
We're close now.
I don't want them to send you away again.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.467
Don't worry, babe,

23:07.177 --> 23:08.845
I've been making friends here.

23:10.388 --> 23:11.765
Everything will be OK.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.084
<i>We've been informed</i>

23:39.167 --> 23:42.629
that Amado Castillo, the drug lord
known as The Lord of the Skies,

23:42.712 --> 23:43.755
has passed away.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.258
<i>The famous drug lord died</i>

23:46.341 --> 23:50.178
<i>during facial reconstruction surgery</i>
<i>at Santa Mónica Hospital</i>

23:51.096 --> 23:53.140
<i>that lasted more than 8 hours.</i>

23:53.265 --> 23:54.891
According to the death certificate,

23:54.975 --> 23:57.394
<i>the cause of death was a stroke.</i>

23:57.477 --> 24:00.522
<i>The next day, Antonio Flores Ponte's body</i>

24:00.605 --> 24:03.567
<i>was taken to Sinaloa by plane...</i>

24:03.650 --> 24:04.901
-Güero!
<i>-The real name...</i>

24:04.985 --> 24:07.529
-What?
-He's dead! Fucking Amado died!

24:07.612 --> 24:08.572
-Silence!
-Fuck yeah!

24:08.655 --> 24:09.656
-The fucker died!
-Silence!

24:09.739 --> 24:10.824
It's time to make our move.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.094
We have to act soon.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.307
Amado didn't have much control
over the different groups anymore.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.308
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
MEXICO CITY

24:36.391 --> 24:38.894
With him dead,
they'll soon become independent,

24:39.603 --> 24:43.190
and their conflicts
will only get worse.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.657
What do you think we should do?

24:53.700 --> 24:55.994
We should work with the biggest fish.

24:57.370 --> 24:59.331
The one that could eat the other fish.

25:04.377 --> 25:05.629
Is this the only way?

25:07.505 --> 25:10.759
We won't end
drug trafficking, Mr. President.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.349
But we can control it.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.446
Who do you suggest?

25:45.043 --> 25:46.544
These are our options.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.433
Protection and expansion for your cartel.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.561
Money for us. That's the deal.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.650
-Sounds good.
-I disagree.

26:10.819 --> 26:14.197
First, you have to promise
to stop doing Chapo favors.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.241
Don't worry about him.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.953
Almoloya or Puente Grande,
it doesn't matter.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.872
Joaquín is locked up in prison.

26:24.499 --> 26:28.003
Locked up? That's not enough.
He should be six feet under.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.046
Ramón is right.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.339
If we're going to be partners,

26:32.090 --> 26:33.925
you can't keep working with Chapo.

26:36.886 --> 26:37.887
Are you sure, Lora?

26:38.388 --> 26:41.975
<i>Yes, Joaquín, the government</i>
<i>chose the Avendaños.</i>

26:44.352 --> 26:47.314
OK, OK. I'm fine.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.575
Fifteen minutes for dinner.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.095
Give it back with the tray.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.876
I want to speak with Ismael. It's Joaquín.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.011
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Brother.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.763
<i>I've got to get out</i>

28:01.846 --> 28:03.223
before the Avendaños take over everything.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.976
You need to find me
a higher contact than Sol.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.363
You got something for me?

28:20.281 --> 28:21.116
Listen.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.495
His wife has always wanted to go to Paris.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.539
Good job, Fontanero.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.791
What are you up to, Joaquín?

28:30.500 --> 28:34.170
I won't sit still while Ismael works.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.590
If I want to be the boss when I get out,

28:38.466 --> 28:40.552
I need to start practicing
being a boss inside.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.650
I want to see him today.

29:01.948 --> 29:02.866

Come in.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.379
Why are you here?

29:18.965 --> 29:21.593
I want to negotiate my conditions
while I stay here.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.418
<i>Nowadays,</i>

29:55.502 --> 30:00.131
<i>Mexican and American authorities</i>
<i>believe the Tijuana Cartel</i>

30:00.215 --> 30:04.219
<i>is the most active and dangerous</i>
<i>criminal organization in Mexico.</i>

30:04.302 --> 30:06.179
Come in.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.485
Let the guards know
I'm expecting the Bernal Leyda brothers.

30:20.568 --> 30:23.029
-It's payday.
-Yes, sir.

Let's go.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.620
<i>Ernesto Ibarra</i>

31:12.704 --> 31:15.456

TIJUANA CARTEL TARGETS KNOWN JOURNALIST

31:37.562 --> 31:38.479
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

31:38.771 --> 31:40.648
It's only a matter of time
before we catch them.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.505
They're the boss' guests.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.146
You motherfucking genius, Chapo.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.440
-Güerito!
-How are you, Arturito?

32:22.523 --> 32:24.984
-You fucking asshole.
-Reibalca.

32:26.653 --> 32:27.946
Look at this.

32:28.029 --> 32:31.074
-What's up?
-Chito, the bread is here.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.328
What would you like to drink?

32:39.499 --> 32:40.583
GUARDS $2,000
COMMANDERS $5,000

32:40.667 --> 32:41.709
DEPARTMENT CHIEF $10,000
DIRECTOR $50,000

33:21.958 --> 33:25.378
So far, so good with the business.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.423
But the situation with the Avendaños
is about to get ugly.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.842
How ugly?

33:32.927 --> 33:34.512
They're messing with the government.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.514
And anyone else who gets in their way.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.643
The power got to their heads,
and there's nobody to set them straight.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.470
You made a mistake choosing the Avendaños.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.142
We want them gone.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.436
Help us, and we'll work with you.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.605
With us.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.025
Joaquín has an offer for you.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.236
Joaquín can't do anything from jail.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.991
We need him free
so we can kill those fuckers.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.452
Our administration is on its way out.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.581
Nobody will risk negotiating his release.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.751
But the new government might.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.505
And you're running for congressman,
aren't you?

34:53.299 --> 34:55.384
What's your relationship
with your candidate?

35:11.984 --> 35:13.528
What's the offer?

35:15.404 --> 35:16.989
Their candidate will get me out of here.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.785
And I'll kill the Avendaños for them.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.747
They're desperate to get rid of them.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.292
Finally those fuckers
will be good for something.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.503
That's not it.

35:31.045 --> 35:34.006
They're not only my ticket out,

35:34.090 --> 35:36.175
I told them once I'm out,

35:36.259 --> 35:38.511
I'd create a federation
to unify the cartels.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.639
Control the revenue like in the old days.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.182
Sounds good.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.769
But what if the candidate
doesn't release you?

35:47.186 --> 35:48.813
Things have changed.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.024
Mr. Sol agreed to be our middleman.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.152
You know the drill.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.611
First, they hate us...

35:56.320 --> 35:57.738
and then, they need us.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.198
And right now...

36:01.325 --> 36:02.493
they really need me.

Mr. Lora that everything's OK.

Open the doors. Another truck is coming.

EXTRADITION ORDER TO THE UNITED STATES
JOAQUÍN GUZMÁN LOERA

36:41.657 --> 36:43.618
Chapo is not a priority right now.

36:43.951 --> 36:45.661
The Avendaños are the problem.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.677
Conrado.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.179
What do you suggest we do?

37:04.430 --> 37:07.433
Extradition was never an option, sir.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.705
I can't be extradited, not now.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.999
Mr. Sol has assured me it won't happen.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.376
He'd better be right.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.086
It's not in their best interest.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.130
They know the Americans would use
everything you know about the government

37:38.256 --> 37:39.423
to keep them compliant.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.218
Mr. Sol will handle this mess.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.304
That buys us some time.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.142
But the threat is still there.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.108
I want to make my own deal with the DEA.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.569
What do you want me to tell them?

38:00.653 --> 38:01.737
Nothing.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.950
Make them come here
and listen to what I have to say.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.383
We're here to evaluate inmates
from area "C."

38:23.968 --> 38:25.219
Thank you.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.669
I'm Pepe.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.133
I'm here to perform a psychological test.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.472
Do you all work for the DEA?

39:10.431 --> 39:11.932
We're listening.

39:14.268 --> 39:15.728
You want the Avendaños.

39:16.812 --> 39:18.022
I can give them to you.

39:21.067 --> 39:21.901
How?

39:23.486 --> 39:26.489
Only drug lords know
how to find other drug lords,

39:26.697 --> 39:29.158
and I'm an expert
at finding those assholes.

39:32.787 --> 39:37.041
In exchange, I want your government
to give up on the extradition thing.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.173
We are not allowed to make deals.

39:45.007 --> 39:49.345
We are here because hearing
what you have to say is part of our job.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.527
I will escape
before letting them take me.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.529
Whatever it takes.

40:08.572 --> 40:11.242
Joaquín, if you escape,

40:11.992 --> 40:13.244
you'll spend the rest of your life hiding.

40:13.327 --> 40:14.787
You said it yourself.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.582
Let your contacts do the work.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.085
Wait for news from the candidate.

41:08.382 --> 41:11.051
-Who's the new girl?
-The first woman ever brought here.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.596
They say she's doing time for murder.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.016
And if they extradite you?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.561
I'll die...

41:20.978 --> 41:22.021
before they take me.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.408
Hello?

41:35.242 --> 41:37.036
The candidate has accepted your offer.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.622
When am I leaving this place?

41:40.206 --> 41:41.582
A couple months, man.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.753
After the elections, once he's president.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.464

This ends now.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.043
Party's over.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.703
Do you understand now
who owns Puente Grande?

43:02.204 --> 43:03.122
You.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.083
What's my name?

43:07.710 --> 43:08.919
Mr. Joaquín.

43:46.373 --> 43:48.375
No, no, stop it.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.647
Chito. Bring me the new girl.

44:12.149 --> 44:13.359
Don't, Joaquín.

44:13.859 --> 44:15.110
We're fine without her.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.655
Bring her.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.000
Stop it, asshole.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.294
Don't worry.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.546
I just want to get to know her
before I leave this place.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.349
She didn't want to come, sir.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.644
Come in.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.107
Have a beer with me.

45:05.035 --> 45:05.869
Here.

45:06.662 --> 45:07.538
So you can relax.

45:31.603 --> 45:33.522
She drank your beer, let her go.

45:55.461 --> 45:57.045
Leave us alone.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.339
Go, hon. Leave.

45:59.423 --> 46:00.883
Go, go.

46:10.517 --> 46:12.186
Chapo.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.692
Nobody tells me no.

46:19.860 --> 46:20.819
Leave her alone, man.

46:22.488 --> 46:23.822
Get out.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.366
You've become a sick motherfucker.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.986
INSTITUTIONAL LABOR PARTY

47:59.042 --> 48:02.421
From now on,
I'll have to call you Mr. Congressman.

48:02.879 --> 48:05.549
Congressman today,
tomorrow president.

48:10.470 --> 48:12.264
<i>The results are in.</i>

48:13.098 --> 48:15.559
<i>A shocking day in Mexican history.</i>

48:16.435 --> 48:21.189
<i>For the first time in over 70 years,</i>
<i>the Institutional Labor Party</i>

48:21.273 --> 48:23.900
<i>has lost the presidential elections.</i>

48:24.651 --> 48:28.989
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>the Institutional Labor Party has lost.</i>

48:29.823 --> 48:32.284
<i>A new party will take control tonight.</i>

48:39.374 --> 48:43.337
We did it! We did it!

48:57.559 --> 48:59.311
<i>Candidate Francisco La Torre</i>

48:59.394 --> 49:04.524
<i>from the Institutional Labor Party</i>
<i>lost the presidential election.</i>

49:22.626 --> 49:24.920
Do you have the results
for the council offices?

49:56.576 --> 49:58.829
Find someone we can negotiate
with in the new government.

50:01.123 --> 50:02.958
It won't be that easy, Joaquín.

50:03.458 --> 50:06.253
The new president has a very close
relationship with the Americans.

50:06.336 --> 50:07.629
How close?

50:09.631 --> 50:11.466
There are rumors
you'll be extradited soon.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.267
No one takes me out of Mexico.

50:21.601 --> 50:23.770
If I can't leave this place legally,

50:24.563 --> 50:26.648
I'll do it illegally.

50:29.651 --> 50:31.153
Ismael, brother.

50:32.654 --> 50:34.573
My candidate lost.

50:34.656 --> 50:36.533
But there's something
the party can do for me.

50:45.208 --> 50:48.628
DÁMASO JIMÉNEZ GÁLVEZ
DEPUTY DIRECTOR, SECURITY

51:03.101 --> 51:04.311
A pleasure, Dámaso.

51:04.519 --> 51:06.104
Ismael spoke very highly of you.

51:06.646 --> 51:08.398
I was brought to help you
in any way I can.

51:09.900 --> 51:10.901
Where do we start?

51:12.110 --> 51:13.236
First things first.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.656
I'm going to tell you
how I plan to escape this place.
