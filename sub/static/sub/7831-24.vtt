about teachers' conference day?

01:33.726 --> 01:35.956
Mmm, I guess that

04:24.230 --> 04:28.098
Bart, what have I told you about
throwing money away at that joke shop?

04:28.201 --> 04:32.570
- To try and cut back a little?
- [Groans] Take those silly things off.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.300
[Grunting]

to take me to the museum!

05:10.943 --> 05:14.435
I know, honey,
but this is a very unusual situation.

05:14.547 --> 05:16.879
At least, it would be for most families.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.577
- What if I took a bus?
- A bus?

05:19.686 --> 05:24.589
Alone? Absolutely not. It's just
too dangerous for an eight-year-old.

05:24.691 --> 05:29.321
In a few years when you're old enough
to drive, then you can take a bus.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.830

of the Isis exhibit!

05:32.932 --> 05:36.527

It's Lisa. I just called

05:52.218 --> 05:55.312
- And can I take the bus to the museum?
- Museum?

05:55.421 --> 05:58.720
Mmm, I don't like the sound of that.
What did your mother say?

05:58.825 --> 06:01.817
Um, I wasrt 100% clear on that.

06:01.928 --> 06:06.160
She said something, but she was kind of in
a rush to get Bart to the emergency room.

06:06.265 --> 06:09.757
Hmm.
So you wanna take the bus, huh?

06:09.869 --> 06:12.133
I don't know.
That's a pretty big decision.

06:12.238 --> 06:16.038
Well, if it would put your mind at ease,
I could take a limousine.

06:16.142 --> 06:19.009
Although, that would cost $200.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.673
$200? Oh!
Isn't there any other way?

06:22.782 --> 06:26.718
Hmm. I guess I could take the bus
if you think that's a better idea.

06:26.819 --> 06:30.721
Frankly, I do.
I know you had your heart set on a limo...

06:30.823 --> 06:33.519
but sometimes daddies
have to say no, honey.

06:33.626 --> 06:36.424

to take the bus.

- Are you gettir on this next bus, kid?

06:57.150 --> 07:00.916

07:28.915 --> 07:33.113
Of course not, honey.
That seat's for my coin purse.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.454

- It doesn't.
- Oh. But isn't this the 22?

08:19.966 --> 08:22.230
Yeah, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

call a souvenir.

[Horns Honking]

13:58.704 --> 14:02.936
Has anyone seen my little girl?

14:04.810 --> 14:06.835
Oh, for God's sakes, my little girl is-
[Gasps]

14:06.946 --> 14:10.006
- Hello.
- Homer, what's going on?
Shouldrt you be at work?

14:10.115 --> 14:13.050
- I am at work. This is what I do.
- But-

14:13.152 --> 14:16.553
- Keep it moving, Marge! This isn't a parking lot!
- I'm sorry.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.849
Whew!
[Screams]

14:19.959 --> 14:23.395
- Shouldrt you be at work right now?
- Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Burns, sir.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.760
Well, then get back to wherever
it is you work, whoever you are.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.559
Excuse me, ma'am.
Have you seen this little girl?

14:31.670 --> 14:34.264
Uh, I'd love to help you, pal,
but I'm on a stakeout here.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.273
Yoink!
Ha-ha!

14:36.375 --> 14:39.902
Oh- Oh, great!
Somebody stop that awful, awful man!

14:40.012 --> 14:41.912
Oh.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.505
Lisa! Lisa!

14:44.617 --> 14:47.643
D'oh! This is no good.
I've gotta get up higher.

14:47.753 --> 14:50.688
Give me all your balloons.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.780
I hope this works.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.520
These are for you if
you let me use your cherry picker.

14:55.628 --> 14:59.155
Well, I've already got some balloons,
but they're not this nice.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.256
Deal!

15:12.978 --> 15:15.879
Excuse me, ma'am?
Uh, hello?

15:15.981 --> 15:18.245
Somebody? Anybody?

15:18.350 --> 15:20.545
- Oh!
- Lisa?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.951
<i>Lisa?</i>
<i>[Gasps]</i>

15:23.055 --> 15:25.046

- Dad!

15:25.157 --> 15:28.684
Stay there!
I'll come down and save you!

15:30.195 --> 15:32.993
What's wrong with this thing?
[Gasping]

15:33.098 --> 15:36.124
[Yelling]

15:39.171 --> 15:44.006
Lisa! Save me!

15:46.345 --> 15:48.870
[Yelling]

15:48.981 --> 15:51.506
Hang on, Dad!

15:56.255 --> 15:58.849
D'oh! Ow!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.892
[Yelling]

16:02.461 --> 16:04.725
- Ow!
- Look out!

16:06.665 --> 16:09.429
Oh, no.
I'm gonna go off the end of the-

16:09.535 --> 16:11.662
D'oh!
[Shouting, Indistinct]

16:15.274 --> 16:18.732
I'm not normally a praying man,
but if you're up there...

16:18.844 --> 16:21.074
please save me, Superman.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.614
[Horn Blowing]

16:26.685 --> 16:30.212
- Hurry! Hurry! Lower the bridge!
- You're the boss.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.820
Dad, grab onto it!

16:35.928 --> 16:37.896
[Whimpering]

16:41.233 --> 16:43.326
[Gasping]
D'oh!

16:43.435 --> 16:47.462
Ow! Oh, Lisa,
thank God you're okay.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.974
D'oh! Ow!
D'oh! Ow!

16:51.076 --> 16:54.170
- You said to crush him, right?
- No!

16:54.279 --> 16:57.043
<i>Are you sure you don't wanna</i>
<i>go to a doctor?</i>

16:57.149 --> 17:01.245
- I mean, a drawbridge did close on your head.
- Nah, I'll just walk it off.

17:04.823 --> 17:08.349
I should have known I wasrt
old enough to take the bus alone...

17:08.460 --> 17:11.327
but I really wanted
to see that exhibit.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.921
I'll never take another
stupid risk like that again.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.829
<i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

17:15.934 --> 17:18.960
- Don't ever say that!
- What?

17:19.070 --> 17:21.596
If I hadrt have taken a stupid risk
with that cherry picker...

17:21.707 --> 17:23.607
I never would've found you.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.406
- I guess.
- Stupid risks are what make life won'th living.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.777
Now, your mother,
she's the steady type...

17:29.882 --> 17:32.214
and that's fine in small doses.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.751
But me, I'm a risk taker.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.980
That's why I have
so many adventures.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.717
[Gasps]
Dad, you're headed for the river again!

17:39.825 --> 17:42.419
- Dad!
- [Chuckling]

17:42.528 --> 17:44.428
Feel your heart pumping
a mile a minute?

17:44.530 --> 17:47.465
That's what my heart's doing
all the time.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.693
Bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.565
Dad, are you all right?

17:51.670 --> 17:55.128
I'm enjoying my life too much to care,
and you should be too.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.937
So what would you like to do right now
more than anything in the world?

17:59.044 --> 18:02.810
See the Isis exhibit!
But the museum's closed.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.815
Hmm.
Closed, eh?

18:04.917 --> 18:08.375
So getting in would be
a pretty big risk.

18:08.487 --> 18:12.048
What do you say, honey?
Feelir stupid? I know I am!

18:16.795 --> 18:21.755
Lisa, we're home!
Sorry about the museum!

18:21.867 --> 18:25.462
[Groans]
You'd better go up and apologize.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.971
But my apologies
always sound so forced.

18:28.073 --> 18:30.041
Do it!

18:34.179 --> 18:36.841
Hey, Lise, I'm sorry
I ruined your Egyptian thing.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.849
We're still buds, right?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.481
<i>Okay, be that way!</i>
<i>Be a big, stupid jerk!</i>

18:43.589 --> 18:48.185
Oh! You're not the jerk.
I am.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.727
Forgive me?

18:50.829 --> 18:53.423
Oh, like you're Miss Perfect!

18:53.532 --> 18:56.433
Mom, Lisa's making me feel bad!

18:56.535 --> 19:00.403
- <i>Stop it, Lisa!</i>
- That shut her up.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.815
Okay, just a little higher.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.442
[Both Grunting]

19:21.160 --> 19:22.684
Dad, I'm kind of scared.

19:22.794 --> 19:25.490
Good. You're gonna need that adrenaline
to make the final jump.

19:27.799 --> 19:30.996
Okay. Here goes.
[Grunting]

19:32.704 --> 19:36.970
Could you open the window?
The cops have Daddy's prints on file.

19:44.216 --> 19:47.447
Wow!
It's magnificent!

19:49.021 --> 19:51.387
<i>Now I know how</i>
<i>Sir Dudley Winthrop felt...</i>

19:51.490 --> 19:55.221
when he first fell through the ceiling
and discovered the Temple of Isis.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.956
Have you ever seen
such exquisite ushabtis?

19:59.064 --> 20:03.501
- Uh, not this exquisite.
- [Gasps]

20:03.602 --> 20:08.164
Oh, my gosh!
It's the mysterious Orb of Isis.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.538
Archaeologists have been
studying it for decades...

20:11.643 --> 20:13.133
and still have no clue
what it means.

20:13.245 --> 20:16.544
Well, Daddy will figure it out.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.639
Oh! We can't touch it, Dad.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.775
It's behind a velvet rope.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.081
A <i>velvet</i> rope.

20:23.188 --> 20:28.023
Lisa, you can't go this far
and then not go further.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.253
[Grunting, Whimpering]

20:34.800 --> 20:37.667
Dad!

20:37.769 --> 20:41.296
- [Gasping]
- Uh-oh.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.101
You broke it!

20:43.208 --> 20:45.403
## [Chiming]

20:51.216 --> 20:53.184
It's a music box.

20:53.285 --> 20:56.618
Dad, we uncovered the secret!

20:56.722 --> 20:59.054
Oh!
So now it's "we," eh?

20:59.157 --> 21:01.523
It's so beautiful.

21:01.627 --> 21:04.494
And just think, we are
the first people to hear its song...

21:04.596 --> 21:07.929
in more than 4,000 years.

21:08.033 --> 21:11.594
Thanks for making me take
such a stupid risk, Dad.

21:11.703 --> 21:14.171
Anytime, honey.
Just remember-

21:14.273 --> 21:17.572
Never be afraid to live life
on the edge.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.474
Now, let's get home
before your mother kills us.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.577
It's kind of humbling, isn't it?

21:24.683 --> 21:28.278
The music we just heard
might never be heard again.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.912
Yeah.
But it'll always live on...

21:31.023 --> 21:33.184
because we'll never forget it.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.226
## [Whistling]

21:36.962 --> 21:39.692
- Dad, that's the Old Spice song.
- It is?

21:39.798 --> 21:43.063
Well, that's a good song too.
