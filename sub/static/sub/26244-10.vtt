and conduct the vast majority of my work.

You pushed that lever
and it started raining.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.414

Why don't I make us some coffees?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.819
This is what coffee tastes like?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.655
I prefer cocoa.

10:55.738 --> 11:00.910
So I confess, my instruments
aren't solely for predicting the weather,

11:00.993 --> 11:04.205
but some of them
are also for controlling it.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.332
But why would you want to control it?

11:06.415 --> 11:10.211
Imagine the possibilities!
What that would mean for the world

11:10.294 --> 11:13.422
if we could harness that power
and make it work for us.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.926
-Oh, boy.
-She's a mad scientist.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.596
[clears throat] So,
the weather station is your laboratory?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.349
Oh, yes, for years now.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.434
I've made progress on wind direction,

11:25.518 --> 11:28.771
pressure manipulation, and the generation
of small-scale weather events,

11:28.854 --> 11:32.817
the likes of which your talking
bird friend just demonstrated.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.111
But it's inconsistent, trivial.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.197
If my experiments have proven anything,

11:38.280 --> 11:41.701
it's that the atmosphere
only truly answers to one thing...

11:42.284 --> 11:43.661
the weather spirits.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.455
They're not easy to find, of course,

11:46.539 --> 11:50.668
but I discovered a way to lure one
and perhaps learn from it,

11:51.168 --> 11:52.628
but it worked too well.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.922
Rather more turned up than expected.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.719
How did you manage
to lure a weather spirit?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.595
That's not important.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.473
The thing is
when two weather spirits meet,

12:04.557 --> 12:05.850
they get into an argument.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.893
They love to debate.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.688
When that happens, a storm occurs.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.899
But when five, ten,
dozens meet at once, well...

12:19.447 --> 12:22.616
If you can control the weather,
isn't there something you can do

12:22.700 --> 12:24.577
to try and move the storm away
from the city?

12:24.660 --> 12:26.746
[sighs] I don't know.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.833
The storm's wreaked havoc on my systems.
I'm not sure the equipment can take it.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.251
But isn't it worth trying?

12:32.334 --> 12:35.045
That storm is terrible,
and it's only gonna get worse.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.548
You've learned to do some amazing things.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.551
If there's a time to use them,
this must be it.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.847
You know what?
You're right!

12:45.473 --> 12:48.434
We're going to try
and summon an air current

12:48.517 --> 12:51.228
to blow the storm away from the city.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.856
-Anemo-motors engaged.
-[machines humming]

12:53.939 --> 12:56.776
Adjusting aneroidic pressure modulators.

12:57.359 --> 13:01.697
When I give the signal,
turn that wheel as far as it'll go, okay?

13:01.781 --> 13:02.615
Okay.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.074
[machines whirring]

13:04.158 --> 13:06.410
[electricity crackling]

13:15.753 --> 13:16.712
Okay!

13:20.216 --> 13:22.218
[rumbling]

13:31.352 --> 13:32.812
It's working!

13:32.895 --> 13:35.314
[alarm blaring]

13:37.566 --> 13:38.818
[machines power down]

13:43.864 --> 13:45.032
Ah, oh.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.409
Oh! I knew it.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.746
No, we can try something else.
There has to be another way.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.998
That was it.
That was the only way.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.793
We just blew up the controls.
No, it's hopeless.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.629
But there are people out there
in that thing right now.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.130
My mum's out there.

14:00.214 --> 14:04.051
There's already
52 centimeters of snow in Trolberg.

14:04.134 --> 14:08.097
By my calculations,
it'll be 168 by nightfall.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.851
At this rate, the city
will be completely buried by morning!

14:13.894 --> 14:16.939
Why do I get the feeling
I'm about to get roped into something?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.862
Hilda, what are you going to do?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.697
The storm's getting worse.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.700
Perhaps we could just fly out there
and talk to the weather spirits.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.743
-There we go.
-Are you crazy?

14:29.827 --> 14:33.247
-You can't go back into that thing.
-We've got to do something.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.915
Hilda, listen to me.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.667
You'd listen to Frida.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.711
That's because Frida
would know what to do.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.922
She'd have a better plan than this.
Have you got a better plan?

14:42.673 --> 14:43.507
No.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.342
Then this is all we've got.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.510
[sighs]

14:50.931 --> 14:51.974
Climb on.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.774
-You're gonna do all the talking, right?
-Sure!

15:03.360 --> 15:05.362
[wind blowing]

15:09.366 --> 15:11.785
-[wind howling]
-[indistinct shouting]

15:20.711 --> 15:23.172
I'm just saying it's completely natural

15:23.255 --> 15:26.759
to precipitate on the windward side
of any hill I come across.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.886
Yeah, it's natural, but is that decent?

15:28.969 --> 15:30.971
Oh, are you calling me indecent?

15:31.055 --> 15:34.516
I think what our friend here
was trying to say is--

15:34.600 --> 15:37.144
-Oh, please, can you elaborate further...
-Hey!

15:37.227 --> 15:40.230
...on the great shame
of a natural heavy rainfall?

15:40.814 --> 15:42.524
-Hey!
-[arguing stops]

15:44.068 --> 15:46.820
A heckler?
What's the meaning of this?

15:48.030 --> 15:50.574
You're doing the talking, remember?

15:53.243 --> 15:57.164
I am your moderator!

15:57.247 --> 15:59.208
[laughing] Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.211
Moderate this! [shouting]

16:04.880 --> 16:06.131
Hilda's right.

16:06.215 --> 16:09.426
Frida would know what to do,
but I'm no use at all.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.806
-Why did I think I would be?
-Uh, are you asking me?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.599
I don't know you, kid.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.185
Take it easy.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.274
Unless...

16:26.443 --> 16:29.196
Okay, you will speak one at a time.

16:29.279 --> 16:32.783
Every spirit will get their time to speak,
so no interrupting.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.701
Are we clear?

16:33.784 --> 16:35.661
-Fine, yes.
-Very well.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.038
-[Hilda] Okay, you first.
-Right, well...

16:38.747 --> 16:40.958
Okay, David, come on.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.544
Victoria, could I get-- No.

16:43.627 --> 16:48.966
Hey, Victoria, I was wondering,
could I get another, uh...

16:54.596 --> 16:56.181
[door opens, closes]

16:56.265 --> 17:01.270
Oh, Victoria, could I get another,
um, one of those coffees?

17:02.271 --> 17:06.608
You know what? That's a wonderful idea.
Though, I think a herbal tea for myself.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.445
More than one coffee,
and I get a little kooky.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.620
-[Victoria] Oh, David!
-[yelps]

17:19.246 --> 17:21.331
-Yes?
-Milk and sugar?

17:21.415 --> 17:22.875
Mm-hmm.

17:22.958 --> 17:27.880
I'm just saying why not steer the rain
towards those that need it most?

17:27.963 --> 17:29.840
I did not blow westwards!

17:29.923 --> 17:33.719
Oh, you wouldn't know your east
from your west. [blows raspberry]

17:34.678 --> 17:38.265
Right, you stay there,
you over here, thank you.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.021
[sighs] Sorry about that. Please continue.

17:44.104 --> 17:46.106
Thank you. [sighs]

17:46.190 --> 17:47.691
As I was saying...

17:51.904 --> 17:53.739
Ah, at last.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.036
-[electricity crackling]
-Oh, cruddlesticks!

17:59.119 --> 18:01.121
Oh, David!

18:01.205 --> 18:02.081
Oh!

18:03.373 --> 18:05.417
[Victoria] Looks like
the storm's easing up.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.253
[grunting]

18:08.337 --> 18:10.839
Okay, you've been bursting
to say your bit for ages.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.758
-Let's hear it.
-[exhales]

18:12.841 --> 18:15.469
Let me start off by saying
that I have never!

18:15.552 --> 18:19.348
I mean, gusts and gales, can you even--
The nature of it, unprecedented!

18:19.431 --> 18:21.475
I can't-- I can't--
I can't even get it out!

18:21.558 --> 18:22.810
[shouting]

18:22.893 --> 18:27.439
I can't quite recall the point
I was trying to make.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.317
Come on, let's go find David
and get out of here.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.364
[Victoria] <i>Now that the abnormal</i>
<i>atmospheric event has come to an end,</i>

18:35.447 --> 18:39.451
Trolberg can look forward to
a gentle breeze blowing in off the fjord.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.369
[door opens, closes]

18:41.870 --> 18:44.248
Good Lord, you look like
you've been in a hurricane!

18:44.331 --> 18:45.207
What happened?

18:45.290 --> 18:48.127
-Goodbye, now.
-Safe travels, friend.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.463
-Will you be joining us?
-No, I need to think.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.258
I came here for a reason,
but in all that arguing,

18:54.341 --> 18:56.301
I can't quite remember.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.346
What was it?
Why did I--

18:59.429 --> 19:00.430
[gasps]

19:01.140 --> 19:01.974
[gasps]

19:02.599 --> 19:03.684
[thunder crashing]

19:07.229 --> 19:08.772
You just talked to them?

19:09.356 --> 19:10.566
Fascinating.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.943
This will be invaluable for the next time.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.528
Next time?

19:14.611 --> 19:17.489
What's wrong
with just observing, learning?

19:17.573 --> 19:19.241
You don't have to control things.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.952
Where did that little boy get to?

19:22.035 --> 19:23.829
His coffee's going to get cold.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.499
David! What were you doing
in Victoria's bedroom?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.459
-I--
-Uh, guys!

19:32.337 --> 19:33.839
I think we're in trouble.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.258
[both shouting]

19:37.092 --> 19:38.677
[both shouting]

19:38.760 --> 19:40.012
[shouts]

19:40.095 --> 19:41.180
David!

19:41.263 --> 19:42.973
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
-Are you okay?

19:43.056 --> 19:45.767
-Can you walk?
-Is it broken? Is it the wrong way around?

19:45.851 --> 19:50.772
I think now would be
a really good time to skedaddle!

19:54.693 --> 19:57.112
Victoria! Come on, let's get out of here!

19:57.196 --> 19:59.281
I won't go!

19:59.364 --> 20:00.699
Shall I try and grab her?

20:00.782 --> 20:04.494
No, get David home and safe right away.
I'm going to stay.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.622
What? What are you gonna do?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.290
I can't just leave her here.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.959
I've talked them down once,
I'll do it again.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.045
Hilda, take these!

20:13.128 --> 20:14.838
Go into Victoria's bedroom.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.549
It's not actually a bedroom.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.970
I'll be back for you as soon as I can.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.599
Where is he? What have you done with him?

20:26.767 --> 20:27.976
[lock clicks]

20:28.060 --> 20:31.021
Hey, hey! [grunts]
You're not allowed in there!

20:34.316 --> 20:36.151
[machine humming]

20:37.027 --> 20:39.821
[monitor beeping]

20:43.200 --> 20:44.618
You poor thing!

20:46.745 --> 20:47.955
[door opens]

20:48.538 --> 20:51.792
-This isn't what it looks like.
-My baby!

20:52.709 --> 20:54.503
This is how you lured them here.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.172
Oh, I-- I can explain!

20:57.256 --> 20:59.967
You kidnapped a spirit to use it as bait.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.469
David was right, you are mad!

21:02.552 --> 21:03.971
[growls]

21:04.054 --> 21:05.222
How did you even--?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.602
No, don't!

21:11.103 --> 21:14.314
Please, you don't know
what I had to do to catch it.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.857
I don't care!

21:39.631 --> 21:41.174
No!

21:49.141 --> 21:50.517
-[thuds]
-[metal squeaks]

21:50.600 --> 21:52.936
What happened?
What happened to Hilda?

21:55.022 --> 21:57.357
Oh, no.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.038
[groaning]

22:12.039 --> 22:13.040
[gasps]

22:17.627 --> 22:18.837
Whoa!

22:26.178 --> 22:28.847
Excuse me! Hey! Hello?
Can you turn back?

22:28.930 --> 22:30.015
My home's that way.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.641
We've got to back!

22:31.725 --> 22:34.436
[screaming]

22:34.519 --> 22:35.437
[grunts]

22:40.150 --> 22:40.984
[Hilda] Oh.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.029
[theme music playing]
