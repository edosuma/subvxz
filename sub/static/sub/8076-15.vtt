[music playing]

00:11.745 --> 00:15.083
[baby cooing]

00:17.685 --> 00:20.721
Five years with a man,
and what have I got?

00:20.754 --> 00:25.059
Well $108 million, but he
didn't get that for me.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.327
OK, four kids.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.465
But only counts for about
eight minutes of his time.

00:31.499 --> 00:32.866
You know what, Jerry?

00:32.900 --> 00:35.369
There's no reason for me and you
to ever have to leave this bed.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.238
We'll be like the
grandparents in "Charlie

00:37.271 --> 00:39.407
and the Chocolate Factory."

00:39.440 --> 00:41.575
As long as we turn ourselves
over every couple of days,

00:41.609 --> 00:42.710
we won't get any bed sores.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.747
OK.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.016
Let's look at predictions
here for the future.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.956
Ellen DeGeneres
relocates to Beirut,

00:55.989 --> 00:58.726
claimed she really is Lebanese.

00:58.759 --> 01:02.763
Sharon Stone finds out her
dad is really Roy Rogers.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.899
Look at this,
former ABC president

01:05.933 --> 01:10.371
Ted Harbert reassigned to
Euro Disney as ticket taker.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.272
[knocking at door]

01:11.305 --> 01:12.173
Roseanne?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.474
How you doing in there?

01:13.507 --> 01:15.176
Hey, I made a really nice lunch.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.877
You want to come
out and join us?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.011
You know the drill.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.514
Leave that food and
back away from the door!

01:20.548 --> 01:21.482
[plates falling]

01:21.515 --> 01:22.850
[footsteps]

01:24.852 --> 01:28.356
[theme music]

01:28.389 --> 01:32.560
What doesn't kill us
is making us stronger.

01:32.593 --> 01:37.665
We're going to last longer than
the greatest wall in China.

01:37.698 --> 01:41.135
Or that rabbit with a drum.

01:41.169 --> 01:45.139
If there's one thing that
I learned while waiting

01:45.173 --> 01:49.643
for my turn is that in
each life some rain falls,

01:49.677 --> 01:52.613
but you also get some sun.

01:52.646 --> 01:56.116
And we'll make out
better than OK.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.620
Hey, here what I say.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.522
Yeah, any day.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.502
[laughs]

02:20.107 --> 02:22.810
Wow, DJ, this is
amazing camerawork.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.313
Thanks, it's the
Elgin water tower.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.647
The angle's so out there.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.282
How did you get that shot?

02:28.316 --> 02:29.883
Well, I stretched my
legs to the scaffolding

02:29.917 --> 02:33.454
with like five or six belts,
and just hung there upside down.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.590
It was pretty cool for a
while, till these guys started

02:36.624 --> 02:39.860
swinging at me with a bat.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.230
Hey, look at my fort.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.831
A fort, David?

02:43.864 --> 02:46.434
You mean the white man station
from which to ruthlessly

02:46.467 --> 02:50.371
slaughter Native Americans?

02:50.404 --> 02:53.040
Andy?

02:53.073 --> 02:55.443
[doorbell rings]

02:55.476 --> 02:56.377
Nancy, oh Leon.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.278
Oh my god.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.612
I'm so glad you guys are here.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.913
Jackie, you look terrible.

02:59.947 --> 03:00.814
How's Roseanne?

03:00.848 --> 03:01.949
She's holed up in the bedroom.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.917
She is beyond depressed.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.253
I don't know what to do.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.354
What's to do?

03:06.387 --> 03:07.721
I mean, isn't this what
we've always wanted?

03:07.755 --> 03:11.359
To isolate Roseanne
from society?

03:11.392 --> 03:14.462
Well I, for one am
lost without Roseanne.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.530
I mean, if I don't have
her to run my life,

03:16.564 --> 03:19.367
my life doesn't run.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.001
Yeah, I'm worried
about her, too.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.636
I mean, it's not that she
hasn't washed her hair,

03:22.670 --> 03:23.904
or gotten out of
bed or anything.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.675
It's just that she's quiet.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.643
Has anyone seen Dan,
or heard from him?

03:29.677 --> 03:30.778
He's still at
the airport hotel.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.446
I don't think he's
left town yet.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.248
Well maybe somebody
should call him.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.316
You well what for?

03:35.349 --> 03:36.517
He's the jerk who
made this whole thing

03:36.550 --> 03:37.451
happen in the first place.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.352
DJ.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.187
That is not helping.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.122
She has been in there
for four days stuffing

03:42.155 --> 03:43.457
herself sick on junk food.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.625
And she has no plans to leave.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.260
We've just got to do something.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.995
Well there's really
only one choice.

03:48.028 --> 03:51.899
We have to do an intervention.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.801
I don't know about that.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.604
I mean, if we all gang up
and then corner your mom,

03:56.637 --> 04:01.542
I mean, she does have
all her teeth, right?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.544
OK.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.778
I'm going to go in there.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.447
And I'm going to try one
last time to get her out.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.716
But I need backup.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.650
We'll be here for you.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.089
Unless, of course, we
go out for ice cream.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.458
God, this is so weird.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.026
I mean, out of
everybody, Roseanne's

04:19.059 --> 04:20.328
usually the strong one.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.262
I have to admit
that I counted on her.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.731
I mean, these past
few months with her

04:23.764 --> 04:26.967
and Jackie just running all
around, neglecting the diners.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.469
Been too much work
for Nancy and I.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.938
I mean, who would have
thought that Roseanne

04:30.971 --> 04:32.573
actually did something?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.474
[door closing]

04:33.507 --> 04:37.411
I got the baby out.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.747
She put him down
to grab a donut.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.983
[music playing]

04:44.552 --> 04:45.419
All right.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.620
Let's focus up, people.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.723
Operation Thunderbolt
is about to commence.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.891
Operation what?

04:50.924 --> 04:55.463
Thunderbolt. You have
to give it a good name.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.331
David?

04:57.365 --> 04:59.032
Your our first man in.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.738
Well, I'm honored.
Wow.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.741
I want to thank you all
for your faith in me.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.410
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Blah, blah, blah.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.310
Hustle up, Junior.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.415
Stay low.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.384
Remember, she favors
her right side.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.217
And Godspeed.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.288
Hey can you see she's
got the horseradish

05:21.321 --> 05:23.991
while you're in there?

05:24.024 --> 05:27.461
Operation Thunderbolt.
I'm all tingly.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.263
[door slams]

05:30.297 --> 05:31.432
I've-- she--

05:31.465 --> 05:33.901
Oh my god.

05:33.934 --> 05:34.802
Oh, no.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.069
Sorry.

05:36.103 --> 05:36.970
It's all right, David.

05:37.004 --> 05:37.905
It's OK.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.206
It's all right.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.675
We knew she'd blow
the first one away.

05:41.709 --> 05:46.346
We just could not afford to
waste one of our power hitters.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.147
Told you, pay up.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.752
All right, all right.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.254
I'll take care of this.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.557
She was just horrible.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.460
[music playing]

06:00.494 --> 06:01.595
She's been in
there for a while.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.996
That's a good sign.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.365
Well, Darlene is carrying
Roseanne's grandchild.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.267
I mean, you remember "Alien 3."

06:07.300 --> 06:09.937
The monster--
monster did not kill

06:09.970 --> 06:13.874
Sigourney Weaver, because it
was carrying the baby alien.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.343
Darlene knows tough love.

06:16.376 --> 06:21.248
I've got one hell of a good
feeling about this one.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.917
Time check.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.318
18 minutes.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.954
Too long, too long.

06:29.823 --> 06:34.294
She could have smothered
Darlene with the French bread.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.596
And we'd never know.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.668
It's a fiasco.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.569
We failed.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.770
No, we didn't fail.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.872
We just haven't quite succeeded.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.174
Which one of your
little happy chat gurus

06:47.207 --> 06:50.778
taught you that little formula?

06:50.811 --> 06:55.549
We have got to get
Darlene out of there?

06:55.583 --> 06:56.450
David?

06:56.484 --> 06:57.851
On your feet.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.220
Oh, no, see--

07:00.253 --> 07:02.422
You-- you can't make
me go back in there.

07:02.456 --> 07:07.294
I close my eyes, I
still see that face.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.063
She's your wife.

07:10.097 --> 07:14.968
And you've been here aunt longer
than I've been her husband.

07:15.002 --> 07:15.803
Let's draw straws.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.818
[animal growling]

07:31.885 --> 07:34.722
[music playing]

07:41.762 --> 07:46.133
Well, we're in day four
of the Lanford standoff.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.703
This could be a bitter winter.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.772
Hey, I got an idea.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.707
We could turn the thermostat
up real high in her room

07:53.741 --> 07:56.610
and sweat her out.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.178
Oh, no, she might want
to take off her clothes.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.552
And that is something we
just do not want to see.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.319
OK.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.256
Why do we do what they
did to the people in Waco?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.725
We blast annoying noise.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.527
One choice there.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.296
Tori Amos.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.166
I love her.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.034
How about one of
those awful Gloria

08:21.068 --> 08:22.770
Gaynor albums from the '70s.

08:22.803 --> 08:27.107
Honey, Gloria
Gaynor was a goddess.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.810
No, no, it's got to be
something hideous, something

08:29.843 --> 08:32.112
nerve racking,
something that'll drive

08:32.145 --> 08:34.281
her to the breaking point.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.115
Mom.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.554
We put mom's voice
on tape and we blast

08:40.588 --> 08:43.991
it through the heating ducts.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.126
Didn't they try
that on Noriega?

08:46.159 --> 08:49.830
Yeah, but they didn't have
grandma, so it didn't work.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.899
No, wait I forgot.

08:51.932 --> 08:56.469
Mom's on a cruise with
her bingo partner.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.272
All right, I'm going in.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.675
Hey, what have I got to lose?

09:01.709 --> 09:03.744
I've already lived 20
years longer than Jesus.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.317
No housekeeping today.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.856
Oh, look at you.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.759
Two days short of a Dick
Gregory intervention.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.130
What are you doing here, Leon?

09:23.163 --> 09:27.367
I'm really not in the mood for
your almost clever repartee.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.335
I'm sorry, Roseanne.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.838
I just enjoy seeing
you depressed.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.273
Here, I brought you
some protein so you can

09:33.306 --> 09:34.975
stave off the diabetic coma.

09:37.978 --> 09:38.846
Oh, god.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.114
It stinks worse than fish.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.115
What is it?

09:42.149 --> 09:44.652
It's fish.

09:44.685 --> 09:48.255
It's line card skate wing with
a side of guava chutney in it.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.091
It is all the rage
on the East Coast.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.492
I don't know how to
tell you this, Leon.

09:52.525 --> 09:56.396
But I think breaded the bait.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.033
Roseanne, I am not prone to
scenes of personal confessions.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.236
But I have walked
through a forest

10:03.270 --> 10:05.272
of deep depression myself.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.273
Actually, Leon.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.475
I don't think you
have the slightest

10:08.508 --> 10:10.543
clue about what I'm feeling.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.479
Roseanne, I once
spent two weeks

10:12.512 --> 10:18.318
on a water bed listening to
Jim Croce when my wife left me.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.720
You were married before?

10:19.753 --> 10:21.521
- Yes, yes.
- To a woman?

10:21.554 --> 10:23.356
Yes Yes.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.292
And if she hadn't
insisted on sex,

10:25.325 --> 10:28.996
we'd probably still be married.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.731
How come you
never told me that?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.032
Well, because
everything in my life

10:32.065 --> 10:35.969
is just grist for
your ridicule mill.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.305
Roseanne, the point
I'm trying to make

10:38.338 --> 10:40.941
is that I have
been in your shoes.

10:40.974 --> 10:45.478
Albeit, a much
more stylish pair,

10:45.512 --> 10:48.682
and I didn't wait till
I felt better to get up.

10:48.716 --> 10:51.752
I got up, and that
made me feel better.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.020
Hmm?

10:53.053 --> 10:55.655
Nah.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.124
Well, how about this?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.993
I haven't had a decent
argument in a week?

11:00.027 --> 11:02.295
Nah.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.231
Roseanne?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.866
If you don't get
out of that bed,

11:05.899 --> 11:07.935
I am going to crawl
in there with you.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.273
Yes I am.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.309
Well I finally got Jerry
and Andy down for their naps.

11:16.343 --> 11:20.113
Had to wait for Jerry's
sugar crash to kick in.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.715
Leon's been in
there since 1:00.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.850
What time is it now?
- 1:18.

11:22.883 --> 11:23.751
1:12.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.086
1:45.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.387
Great.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.056
Well I guess we all forgot
to synchronize our watches.

11:31.759 --> 11:37.530
Well, the good news is I'm
going to learn how to get

11:37.564 --> 11:41.268
guava chutney out of cashmere.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.236
I want to go next.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.072
Why if you don't have to?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.139
I've got to meet her.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.041
I mean, all these
people are freaking out.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.310
I haven't seen this kind of
rallying since Tim Leary was

11:50.343 --> 11:52.345
going to commit suicide online.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.281
All right, but not now.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.182
It's too dangerous.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.416
Come on.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.584
All right, we'll go around
the side of the house.

11:57.617 --> 11:58.819
You can peek through the bushes.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.388
For god's sake, I'm
a 14-year-old woman.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.222
I'm going in.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.598
Hi, I'm Heather.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.499
Hi.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.634
Out.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.535
No, no, wait.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.370
I'm a friend of DJ's.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.907
Oh, oh, yeah.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.909
Yeah, you're the one
he's talking about.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.978
He's got a lot of good
things to say about you.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.814
Very nice to meet you.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.248
Out.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.149
No, no, wait.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.617
I really need to talk to you.

12:30.650 --> 12:31.819
I'm worried about DJ.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.154
I mean, he's really,
really concerned about you.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.055
Why?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.156
I'm going to be OK.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.858
It's not like I'm going
to die or anything.

12:37.891 --> 12:38.691
Well, OK.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.598
Anything else?

12:45.632 --> 12:48.068
Yeah, well I really
did want to meet you.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.003
Oh good, well now you have.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.105
And on the way out, why don't
you ask my sister to give

12:52.139 --> 12:55.508
you a lovely parting gift?

12:55.542 --> 12:56.409
You know what?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.744
This really takes me back.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.580
I mean, this is exactly
how my mom spent the '80s.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.415
Oh, really?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.583
Was she sick?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.853
No, she was exactly
like you are now.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.087
But all the time.

13:07.120 --> 13:11.892
Did any annoying little
girls come in and gawk at her?

13:11.925 --> 13:12.792
Well, I don't know.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.328
You'll have to ask her herself.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.329
So what are you going to do?

13:16.363 --> 13:18.731
Stay in bed for the
rest of your life?

13:18.765 --> 13:21.368
No, actually only till
the mother ship comes back

13:21.401 --> 13:22.202
and then I'm out of here.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.006
What are you going to do?

13:26.039 --> 13:28.275
Only eat Hoho's just because
your husband left you?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.109
These are not Ho Hos.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.582
These are Little Debbie's.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.352
Whatever.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.254
No, no, there is
a big difference.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.089
Believe me.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.794
So you think DJ's
really worried about me?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.162
Well yeah.

13:49.196 --> 13:53.233
Well, you better get out
there and check on him, then.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.368
You know, whether
you like it or not,

13:55.402 --> 13:57.037
we all really need
you out there.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.505
So why don't you come
out when you stop

13:58.538 --> 14:00.407
feeling sorry for yourself?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.642
Bye.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.011
How'd it go?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.213
I tanked.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.015
I'm here now now money.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.417
You have got to
get out of my face.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.384
Unless there's food in there.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.819
I tried to order pizza.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.455
They wouldn't deliver
through the window.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.025
The only food you
need is spiritual.

14:18.058 --> 14:22.795
I brought crystals,
healing music,

14:22.829 --> 14:26.366
books that contain the spiritual
wisdom of the universe.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.935
The Mahabharata,
the Tao Te Ching,

14:27.968 --> 14:34.174
the Kabbalah, the Torah, the
New Testament, and the Koran.

14:34.207 --> 14:38.478
How long were you planning
on staying in here, Nancy?

14:38.511 --> 14:42.615
This crystal has very
powerful qualities.

14:42.649 --> 14:46.253
[sitar music playing]

14:47.487 --> 14:49.990
And this candle represents
the light of God.

14:50.023 --> 14:55.595
We set it here knowing that
the darkness will disappear.

14:55.628 --> 15:00.333
If I blow that out, will you
disappear into the kitchen?

15:00.367 --> 15:02.936
Roseanne, this is
all about healing.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.272
It's not just about Dan.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.941
It's about the anger, the
abrasiveness, the harshness

15:07.975 --> 15:10.010
that has been eating you alive.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.213
The poison that's been running
through your spirit for years.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.382
Nancy, that is my spirit.

15:21.654 --> 15:29.396
Feel a sensation of calmness
and compassion wash over you.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.764
Can you feel it?

15:31.798 --> 15:35.135
Oh, yeah definitely.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.569
Good.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.939
Because we all
need you, Roseanne.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.342
Leon and I need you
back at the diner.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.677
I mean, I know it doesn't
mean that much to you anymore.

15:44.711 --> 15:48.548
But for Leon and I,
it's our only income.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.118
Could we maybe
discuss business when

15:51.151 --> 15:53.086
I feel a little bit better?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.621
Sure.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.824
Great, well come back
in about a year or so.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.793
Do not despair, Roseanne.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.529
God works in mysterious ways.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.401
Thanks for the crystal.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.337
[door shuts]

16:10.370 --> 16:11.604
OK, kids.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.407
Your mother needs a clearing
like nobody's business.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.277
I'm going to throw some
crystals, do a little chanting,

16:17.310 --> 16:19.212
and if I have anything left,
I'm going to do a [inaudible]

16:19.246 --> 16:21.381
and throw some of your
father's clothes into a fire.

16:24.184 --> 16:27.487
It's imperative, for
the next five minutes,

16:27.520 --> 16:30.523
that no one have any
negative thoughts.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.358
Freak.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.029
Hey Mark.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.399
I got no time to
say hi to you, pal.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.433
I got to talk to Mrs. Conner.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.135
Now where is she?

16:42.169 --> 16:46.939
Hello, the woman's been in
bed for the past four days.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.675
Believe me, it's not
a very pretty sight.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.811
The woman is-- she's
crippled by heartache.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.980
She may never be whole again.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.050
Lord knows I've been there.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.086
I've got to go talk to her.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.053
Oh, go for it.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.121
We've tried everything else.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.590
Maybe gibberish will work.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.524
Damn right, it will.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.658
And I want you all
to come and hear

17:05.692 --> 17:07.527
what I have to say to her, OK?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.428
Well, come on team!

17:08.461 --> 17:09.596
It's full court press time.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.398
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

17:16.136 --> 17:17.237
What in the hell is this?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.140
The grand finale?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.542
Mrs. Connor, I have
something to tell you.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.078
I put two and two
together, and, well,

17:25.112 --> 17:28.715
here's what I came up with, OK?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.050
Mr. Connor doesn't
want to leave town.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.852
Mark, don't toy
with the woman.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.354
She's hanging on by a thread.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.288
Wait a minute, Jackie.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.489
Now, he goes to
the airport and he

17:36.523 --> 17:37.524
doesn't get on his plane.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.625
What is that?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.260
And instead of checking
on the next flight,

17:40.293 --> 17:41.594
he checks in to
an airport hotel.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.829
Even weirder.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.665
You know, come to
think of it, Scott

17:45.698 --> 17:47.367
thought he saw him at the mall.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.437
And he was buying a winter coat.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.205
Now does that sound like
a guy going to California?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.106
Sure doesn't.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.507
Exactly.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.976
So I figured this is a guy just
looking for an excuse to stay.

17:57.009 --> 18:00.747
So I started brainstorming.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.948
No wonder you look
a little flushed.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.219
Here's what I came
up with, all right?

18:06.253 --> 18:07.587
I called Dan and
I told him that he

18:07.620 --> 18:09.856
signed a government
contract for that big prison

18:09.889 --> 18:10.890
construction job.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.393
If he doesn't show
up, we lose the job.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.295
Yeah, well I hate to be
a wet blanket here, Mark,

18:15.328 --> 18:17.197
but anyone can get
out of a contract.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.433
Yeah, if he wants to.

18:20.467 --> 18:26.206
You know what it means, Dan is
staying here for you, Roseanne.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.975
Wow, so come on,
Mrs. Conner, get up.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.211
Come out, I'll start the shower.

18:31.244 --> 18:34.747
Yeah, what do you say?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.383
Well, I need some
time to sort this out.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.650
Which I cannot do
without all of you

18:37.684 --> 18:40.019
sitting there staring at me.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.754
Can you just get out and
leave me alone, please?

18:44.591 --> 18:47.927
[music playing]

18:52.432 --> 18:54.734
You know, I thought for sure
I would have got through to her.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.537
You had to suggest a shower.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.705
Thanks a lot, everybody.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.139
You gave it your best shot.

19:00.173 --> 19:03.243
[door closing]

19:03.276 --> 19:05.111
My god, Mrs.
Connor you're out.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.613
All right, back
back, everybody.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.481
Back.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.749
Come on, no touching.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.017
She's like a zoo animal.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.685
If she runs behind a bush,
we'll never see her again.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.724
I would just like to
apologize to everybody

19:17.757 --> 19:19.792
for shutting you out like that.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.893
Oh, we understand.

19:20.927 --> 19:21.894
Right, guys?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.263
Yeah, of course.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.864
Let me tell you something.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.966
From this day forward,
things are going to change.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.236
No more laying around
feeling sorry for myself.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.004
Dan or not, I am going
ahead with my life.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.940
I am moving forward.

19:33.973 --> 19:37.076
Which one of my spiritual
books turned you around?

19:37.109 --> 19:40.313
Was is the Tony Robbins book?

19:40.347 --> 19:41.848
Actually, everybody
really helped me.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.650
But I have to say most
of all, it was Mark.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.553
Because that was just
a brilliant idea, Mark.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.922
I guess everybody has
that one in a lifetime.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.324
It was nothing, Mrs. Connor.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.961
You know, anyone with four days
to kill could have up with it.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.497
The point is that you have
made me realize that I have

19:57.530 --> 19:59.098
got to take care of business.

19:59.131 --> 20:02.034
And Jackie, I think we should
just give up the diner.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.035
No argument there.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.170
I think we should
just turn over

20:04.203 --> 20:06.239
our shares to Leon and Nancy.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.441
Roseanne that is so great.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.676
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.944
Let me make sure I understand
what you're saying.

20:11.978 --> 20:18.385
You are giving us the diner, so
we will be there and you won't?

20:18.418 --> 20:21.220
Exactly, Leon.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.556
I want you guys to feel
what me and Jackie felt when

20:23.590 --> 20:24.824
we first started that place.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.294
I mean, for the first time,
we felt like we really

20:27.327 --> 20:28.995
controlled our own destiny.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.330
Right, we bought the diner.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.365
And then we worked really
hard to make something of it.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.633
It wasn't like
winning the lottery.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.967
You know, getting
something for nothing.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.503
We really earned that.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.404
You know, mom.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.305
You're all right.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.072
Here, here.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.675
This is the first intervention
I've actually seen work.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.114
You know, I know that
I've inspired you guys.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.250
But tonight you really
all inspired me.

20:51.284 --> 20:54.687
I'm really touched by
everything that you

20:54.721 --> 20:56.523
did from me here tonight.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.091
I feel like the richest
woman in all of Lanford,

20:59.125 --> 21:02.529
with or without the money.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.831
I think I'll go take a shower.

21:04.864 --> 21:08.100

21:12.004 --> 21:14.541
Rosie, it's about taking
control of your life.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.309
It's about finding a
passion other than the food.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.346
You got to use your personal
power and turn things around.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.213
And if you're going to start
feeling better emotionally,

21:21.247 --> 21:22.582
you gotta to take
care of your body.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.583
Now let me tell you something.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.284
We've got to start
with your diet.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.886
You know, I personally
am a strict vegetarian.

21:26.919 --> 21:27.787
How about you?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.889
What are we going to do here?

21:29.922 --> 21:32.625
Well, Tony, you know.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.694
There's no meat in a Ho Ho.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.265
Oh, cool.
You got me there.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.066
Scoot over.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.372
Let's toast.
