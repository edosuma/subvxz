WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:13.472
-Get goin', go on -Get goin', go on

00:13.555 --> 00:15.891
-Take friends along -Take friends along

00:15.974 --> 00:18.143
-Go do it all -Go do it all

00:18.227 --> 00:20.103
We all just gotta unplug

00:20.187 --> 00:22.564
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
Just like the way Doug unplugs

00:25.651 --> 00:29.071
Another day, another successful reboot.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.989
Efficient work, Becky Bot!

00:31.073 --> 00:32.198
You too, Doug.

00:32.281 --> 00:35.285
Wow, thanks--

00:35.369 --> 00:37.412
Looks like Doug's battery is low.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.498
My bot, I think you need a charge.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.210
I think we all need a--

00:43.293 --> 00:46.880
Time to head to the recharge room.

00:46.964 --> 00:50.300
And fast.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.182
Okay.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.935
Now we wait here on these recharge pods...

01:05.399 --> 01:07.359
until charge complete!

01:07.943 --> 01:09.820
Our batteries are full again!

01:09.903 --> 01:11.154
Let's get back to work.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.449
Wait! I've got an incoming call.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.451
Doug!

01:16.535 --> 01:17.661
It's Emma!

01:17.744 --> 01:21.248
Brace yourself. I have the most exciting news ever!

01:21.331 --> 01:23.000
Since we're bestest friends,

01:23.083 --> 01:27.588
my parents want to take your family out to dinner at our favorite restaurant!

01:28.172 --> 01:29.173
Really?

01:29.256 --> 01:30.465
Sounds great, Emma.

01:30.549 --> 01:31.592
We're in!

01:31.675 --> 01:33.051
Fantastic!

01:33.135 --> 01:36.096
Meet us tonight, six o'clock, Mega City Restaurant.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.058
Wow, we're gonna have a great time at the restaurant.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.019
And do all the restaurant things.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.896
And make new restaurant friends.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.148
So, what is a restaurant?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.108
I don't restaurant know.

01:48.192 --> 01:51.486
Only one way to find out. I gotta plug in.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.489
Come on in There's seats aplenty

01:54.573 --> 01:56.658
Check the menu We have many

01:56.742 --> 02:00.954
Meals you may or may not know Look, a table near the window

02:01.038 --> 02:02.206
Order up

02:03.373 --> 02:05.792
Kawaii rolls on a sushi train

02:05.876 --> 02:08.086
-Big soufflé at a French café -Yum

02:08.169 --> 02:10.422
Diner waffle The size of a plate

02:10.506 --> 02:12.674
-Taco cocina -Hey, hey, hey

02:12.758 --> 02:14.927
Pass the dish And try the fish

02:15.010 --> 02:16.929
'Cause we're eating out At a restaurant

02:17.012 --> 02:18.263
Order up, up, up, up

02:19.556 --> 02:21.600
Eating out at a restaurant

02:21.683 --> 02:22.893
Order up, up, up, up

02:23.894 --> 02:24.895
Yum

02:26.230 --> 02:28.023
So that's what a restaurant is.

02:28.106 --> 02:32.736
Only, I have a big question. What do you do at a restaurant?

02:32.819 --> 02:36.323
Not a problem, my bot. We're highly efficient robots.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.658
We can figure it out.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.160
Let's unplug and go to the restaurant.

02:40.744 --> 02:44.248
Six o'clock. Exactly on time.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.583
We're off to an optimal start.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.628
Wow. I can't believe we're in a real restaurant.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.214
But what do we do at a restaurant?

02:52.673 --> 02:56.134
Well, I see food everywhere I scan.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.595
I guess we should find something to eat.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.514
Bot family, spread out.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.852
I found some food up here!

03:08.522 --> 03:11.233
And there's a whole bunch of food coming out of this window.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.030
This human has a whole plate of food.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.708
Doug. My Doug, Doug, Doug. What are you doing?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.168
Hi, Emma.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.380
We're about to eat at a restaurant like humans do.

03:34.423 --> 03:38.385
Doug, that's not exactly how you eat at a restaurant.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.553
It's not?

03:40.429 --> 03:42.472
You mean we've already made errors?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.726
It's just... This is our first time at a restaurant, Emma.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.561
We don't know what to do.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.980
Bring it on in, Bots.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.315
Look, don't worry.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.819
I've been to a restaurant, like, six times, so I'm basically an expert.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.530
Just watch me and I'll show you how it works.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.701
Pine family, meet the Bot family.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.912
Put her there, Pine family.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.330
How about a hug?

04:07.497 --> 04:10.459
It is such a pleasure to finally meet Doug's parents.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.295
I'm Mr. Pine, but you can call me Laurence.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.173
And I'm Mrs. Pine. But you can call me Monica.

04:16.255 --> 04:20.177
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Bob Bot, but you can call me Bob Bot.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.053
I'm Becky Bot.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.224
And who are these two small humans?

04:25.307 --> 04:28.227
These two roadrunners are Tabatha and Agatha.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.853
Hiya, Bot family!

04:29.937 --> 04:31.480
Hi, Doug's mom and dad.

04:31.897 --> 04:35.567
Now that we've all had the pleasure of meeting, let's get a table!

04:36.527 --> 04:39.530
Welcome to Mega City Restaurant. Is this your entire party?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.406
A party? Here?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.825
Cue the party music, son.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.133
Robots, I like the way you party.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.762
But she really just wants to know if our whole group is here.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.392
Yep, we're all here.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.727
Great. Then follow me.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.234
Wow, so this is our table?

05:17.693 --> 05:20.946
And is that music I hear? Should we dance again?

05:21.029 --> 05:24.116
All right. Here we go, family.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.747
That's quite the move you're doing. Is that the robot?

05:30.831 --> 05:34.001
I don't know, but that is such a good name for it!

05:34.751 --> 05:36.378
Yeah.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.427
I didn't realize restaurants gave you instruments at the table.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.722
Those aren't really instruments, Doug. They're silverware.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.140
We use them to eat.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.517
Yeah. They're, like, tools for eating.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.687
Food tools.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.607
Yup, they're super-duper important.

05:56.690 --> 06:01.445
But before you use your silverware, you put your napkin in your lap.

06:01.528 --> 06:05.407
It's like a mini-blanket that keeps your clothes clean if anything spills.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.910
Family, place your napkins.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.748
It looks like I'm missing my... What did you call it?

06:12.831 --> 06:16.418
A napkin. Don't worry, Bob Bot. We'll tell the server to bring one over.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.128
No need. I found one.

06:18.504 --> 06:19.796
No, wait!

06:22.466 --> 06:23.634
Amazing.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.553
Bob Bot, I didn't know you were a magician.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.096
Neither did I.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.556
Way to go, Dad.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.851
All right, everyone. I think it's time we order some food.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.021
What?

06:37.189 --> 06:39.316
What is this giant book for?

06:39.399 --> 06:43.403
It's a menu. It lets you know about all the different food they have here.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.781
So it's like a book for food?

06:45.864 --> 06:48.617
Books? I read those to Doug when he was little.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.244
Let me give this a try.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.581
Once upon a time, there was a turkey meat loaf

06:54.665 --> 07:00.671
who was served with your choice of potato, soup or mixed seasonal salad...

07:01.839 --> 07:03.465
with club sauce.

07:05.133 --> 07:11.974
Or for diners looking for something sweet, try our big, bold desserts.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.643
Dessert is yummy.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.936
Yay, desserts!

07:16.019 --> 07:20.774
Creamy cheesecake or yummy, yummy fruit salad.

07:20.858 --> 07:25.279
Or, if you're feeling bananas, banana split.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.364
The end.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.576
Wow, I did not see that coming.

07:30.659 --> 07:31.785
Great job, Mom.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.705
I think we're finally figuring this restaurant thing out.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.206
You said it, my bot.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.251
Hi, I'm Brad. I'll be your server this evening.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.503
What can I get you folks to eat?

07:41.587 --> 07:44.131
All right, Bots. It's time to order your food.

07:44.214 --> 07:48.552
I know there's a lot of amazing options, but you gotta pick just one.

07:59.521 --> 08:03.275
Well, according to my sensors, the salmon sounds delicious.

08:03.358 --> 08:07.738
And I will be having the turkey club.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.032
-Meat loaf for me, please. -Spaghetti, please.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.617
-Me too. -Salmon for me.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.118
-Turkey club for me. -Me too!

08:13.202 --> 08:15.370
Sounds great!

08:16.038 --> 08:18.707
I'll be right back with your food in a jiff.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.001
You guys nailed it.

08:21.585 --> 08:22.711
That's a good thing.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.130
So, what do we do now, Emma?

08:25.214 --> 08:27.633
Now comes the hardest part.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.092
Waiting for the food.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.969
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.054
Waiting.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.847
Looks like these roadrunners are getting restless.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.892
Time to break out the crayons.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.102
Why do your sisters get crayons?

08:39.186 --> 08:42.063
So they can draw while they wait for the food to come.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.857
What should we do while we wait?

08:43.941 --> 08:47.569
We talk. We can ask each other questions like...

08:49.029 --> 08:50.280
What's your favorite color?

08:50.364 --> 08:51.490
My favorite color?

08:52.824 --> 08:55.452
Computing. Blue!

08:55.536 --> 08:56.537
Me too!

08:56.620 --> 08:58.997
I'd love to learn more about what you all do at Rebots.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.501
Well, we take things that are used or broken

09:02.584 --> 09:04.419
and turn them into something new.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.463
I'll show you with these napkins.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.423
Cool!

09:08.507 --> 09:10.259
-How interesting! -Very!

09:10.342 --> 09:11.468
Look!

09:11.552 --> 09:13.720
It could be a ketchup and mustard holder.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.222
Ketchup and mustard?

09:15.305 --> 09:16.515
Sounds like food.

09:16.598 --> 09:17.724
Wait!

09:17.808 --> 09:21.270
You don't eat them like that. You put 'em on your food.

09:23.021 --> 09:26.024
Your basket actually reminds me of when Emma was little.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.818
She loved to make things too.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.153
Same with Doug.

09:30.237 --> 09:34.783
He made an exact replica of Rebots before he even learned to reboot.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.495
He's quite the bot, your son.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.206
It's so nice they're friends.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.667
Okay, folks, who's ready to eat?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.879
The food's here already? Wow, that went fast.

09:46.962 --> 09:51.466
Yeah. We were having so much fun talking, we stopped calculating the time.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.969
Mom, Dad, we did it.

09:54.052 --> 09:58.765
We ordered the food, we waited, now we're going to eat at a restaurant!

09:58.849 --> 10:02.227
Bring it in. Time for a robot family robot cheer.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.896
Go, robots!

10:06.773 --> 10:09.651
Oh, no. We just dropped the silverware!

10:09.735 --> 10:11.361
We can't eat without it.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.779
Those were our tools.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.490
We cheered too soon.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.868
Doug, why do you look so sad?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.704
Because we can't eat without our silverware.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.040
But aren't you having a great time?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.791
Well, yeah.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.002
We had a great time talking with you.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.379
Yeah, we have a lot in common.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.006
Wait a nanosecond!

10:31.089 --> 10:34.843
So, going to a restaurant is about more than eating food.

10:34.927 --> 10:37.429
It's about getting to know each other better.

10:37.513 --> 10:40.224
That's why I like going to restaurants so much!

10:40.307 --> 10:43.727
Also, we can still eat. We just have to ask for more silverware.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.062
I'm already on it.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.191
So, what do we do now?

10:49.274 --> 10:52.611
Well, Doug, now we dig in!

10:52.694 --> 10:54.404
Dig in, dig in!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.575
Thanks for showing us what to do at a restaurant, Emma.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.702
I learned the best part of eating out

11:00.786 --> 11:04.456
is getting a chance to spend time and talk with the people you care about.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.918
A chance to talk. That gives me an idea!

11:11.713 --> 11:14.466
I'm loving the new setup, Doug.

11:14.550 --> 11:17.719
It's so much nicer to charge and chat.

11:17.803 --> 11:21.890
Since we all had such a nice time talking with each other at the restaurant,

11:21.974 --> 11:25.394
I figured we could do the same thing here in the recharge room.

11:32.651 --> 11:35.153
I can't wait for my grandbots to get here.

11:35.237 --> 11:36.238
Me too.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.949
And look, there's someone coming to the door!

11:39.032 --> 11:40.117
Is it them?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.369
Welcome to Rebots!

11:43.412 --> 11:45.622
Supercharged greeting for the Jen-ster.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.124
Whoops.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.710
-It's not them. -We got the wrong bot.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.003
Was it something I said?

11:51.086 --> 11:53.380
Sorry, Jenny. We're glad to see you.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.258
It's just, we thought you were my grandbots.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.511
They're coming for a visit today and should be here any minute.

11:59.595 --> 12:02.639
I even brought some "happy to see you" confetti!

12:03.307 --> 12:05.058
That sounds robo-tastic!

12:05.142 --> 12:08.604
Make sure to give a big hello to the grandbots from the Jen-ster!

12:10.689 --> 12:12.566
Looks like I've got a call coming through.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.942
Hello, everybotty.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.027
Hi, Grandbot.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.613
We're in the factory waiting for you and...

12:18.113 --> 12:21.450
Wait. Aren't you and Nana supposed to be coming to visit?

12:22.576 --> 12:24.161
Well, you're right, Doug.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.080
And I'm so sorry, but your nana's got a case of the glitches

12:27.164 --> 12:29.124
and needs to stay in for an upgrade today.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.421
And I'm just as sad as an ungreased gear about it.

12:34.505 --> 12:37.174
I was so looking forward to our visit.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.177
Well, take care, you two.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.513
We'll see you another time.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.556
Bye, Grandbot. Bye, Nana.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.724
Feel better!

12:46.475 --> 12:51.146
Sorry. I know you were all really looking forward to seeing Nana and Grandbot.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.649
Nana looks so sad.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.693
I wish there was something we could do to cheer her up.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.279
But Doug, there is!

12:59.363 --> 13:01.990
We should send Nana a pick-me-up!

13:02.574 --> 13:04.701
Pick-me-up? What's a pick-me-up?

13:04.785 --> 13:06.787
You've never heard of a pick-me-up?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.872
Time to give it a plug, Doug.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.506
When I'm feeling down A hug can bring me up

13:18.131 --> 13:21.718
When I'm feeling low Kind words can get me going

13:21.802 --> 13:26.014
Like a note in my lunch box That says, "I think you rock"

13:26.098 --> 13:30.769
Or a walk around the block Or maybe we'll just talk

13:31.937 --> 13:33.188
Yeah, pick me up

13:33.272 --> 13:34.731
Pick me up Yeah

13:36.191 --> 13:37.401
Yeah, pick me up

13:37.484 --> 13:38.944
Pick me up Yeah

13:40.404 --> 13:44.491
I was feeling sad Until you came along

13:45.242 --> 13:50.414
Now I'm happy Singing this song

13:55.085 --> 13:56.295
I see!

13:56.378 --> 13:58.964
A pick-me-up is a way to cheer someone up

13:59.047 --> 14:01.967
and make them go from sad to happy.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.887
I've gotta unplug and cheer up Nana.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.056
Only, I have one big question.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.808
How can I cheer up Nana?

14:09.892 --> 14:10.893
I got it!

14:11.351 --> 14:13.061
By giving her a card.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.063
Whenever my mom or dad are down,

14:15.147 --> 14:18.066
I give them a card and it cheers them right up.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.401
A card?

14:19.484 --> 14:22.404
I'm not sure we have one of those at Rebots, Emma.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.033
That's why we're gonna make one from scratch, Doug,

14:26.575 --> 14:31.246
using the ancient and powerful art of... crafting.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.832
But isn't it hard to make a card?

14:34.249 --> 14:37.753
Don't worry, Doug. We're on a mission to cheer up Nana.

14:37.836 --> 14:42.132
It's nothing a couple of secret agents can't handle.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.094
Project Pick-Me-Up is a go.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.263
Phase one: make the card.

14:49.139 --> 14:53.227
The first thing we're gonna need to do is find some paper.

14:54.186 --> 14:57.105
I know where we have loads of paper! Come with me.

14:58.941 --> 14:59.942
See?

15:02.319 --> 15:03.320
Doug.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.572
We can't use these to make a card.

15:05.656 --> 15:09.284
They're all used and faded and full of articles

15:09.368 --> 15:12.329
like "Cute Puppies Need a Home"?

15:13.497 --> 15:15.541
Yup, I'm saving that one.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.042
It's okay, Emma.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.169
We're at Rebots, remember?

15:19.253 --> 15:21.755
We can reboot these into whatever we need.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.217
That's it!

15:25.300 --> 15:30.180
We can make this old newspaper into new colorful construction paper.

15:36.979 --> 15:37.980
All right!

15:39.898 --> 15:42.442
Now it looks like a card.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.279
Perfect! Then let's go cheer Nana up with it.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.239
Doug. Not yet.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.160
Phase two: write the message.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.203
Message?

15:53.287 --> 15:58.208
Yeah. You fill it up with words that let Nana know what you love about her.

16:06.592 --> 16:11.805
"Dear Nana, Beep beep boop, beep boop boop beep."

16:14.558 --> 16:15.642
I'm not sure if--

16:15.726 --> 16:16.977
"Beep beep boop"?

16:18.020 --> 16:20.522
That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

16:21.690 --> 16:25.527
It's robot for "I love your laugh. I love your smile.

16:25.611 --> 16:29.740
You have a great operating system. You're the best nana in the world."

16:31.283 --> 16:34.828
Doug. That's the perfect robot message.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.207
Phase three: decorate the card.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.418
You mean like with my favorite computer parts?

16:42.127 --> 16:46.632
Or we can decorate the card with things that Nana loves.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.758
Let's see.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.010
Nana's favorite things.

16:50.427 --> 16:55.641
I remember when Nana and I walked around her farm looking at flowers.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.352
She said daisies were her favorite.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.939
We should find a daisy and put it in the card!

17:02.022 --> 17:04.441
Come on. Maybe we can find one outside.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.861
All agents, canvass the yard.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.532
That means spread out and look around.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.662
Code Buttercup in sector seven.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.251
Azalea alert in sector four.

17:22.334 --> 17:25.587
Wait, what did you say Nana's favorite flower was again?

17:25.671 --> 17:28.006
It's a daisy!

17:28.089 --> 17:30.050
Look, I found this one on the ground.

17:30.884 --> 17:35.097
We have the daisy. Repeat, we have the daisy.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.181
Yeah!

17:36.265 --> 17:40.352
Nana may be sad now, but this daisy will cheer her up for sure.

17:41.562 --> 17:44.982
And maybe we could put something else she likes on the front of the card.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.233
You know it!

17:46.316 --> 17:49.528
Time to access your memory banks again, Doug.

17:49.611 --> 17:55.158
Well, after Nana and I looked at flowers, we climbed a hill and looked at the stars.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.077
Nana loves the starry sky!

17:57.160 --> 18:01.915
Only, how can we get a whole starry sky onto this little card?

18:04.168 --> 18:06.879
Doug, that's it! We need some paint.

18:08.547 --> 18:10.924
One starry sky coming up.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.430
Not bad, Doug.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.683
I think this card is really gonna cheer up Nana.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.435
You bet your gears it is!

18:21.518 --> 18:26.732
Now comes phase four: deliver the card.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.902
Great idea, Emma. Let's go to the farm!

18:30.777 --> 18:33.864
Project Pick-Me-Up phase four is a go.

18:53.008 --> 18:57.137
Visual sensors indicate we finally made it to my grandbots' farm.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.016
The card has landed.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.686
All agents prepare to cartwheel happily.

19:05.354 --> 19:08.398
I can't wait to give this to Nana and cheer her up.

19:11.235 --> 19:13.612
Emma, do you know what that is?

19:13.695 --> 19:15.739
That, Doug, is a goat.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.868
And there are two things to always remember about goats.

19:19.952 --> 19:22.746
Number one, they're pretty silly.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.290
And number two...

19:26.875 --> 19:29.419
they love to chew on things!

19:31.088 --> 19:33.006
The goat's got the card!

19:37.970 --> 19:39.137
Look!

19:59.825 --> 20:04.830
I guess there is a third thing to always remember about goats.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.832
They're really hard to catch.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.959
And they keep surprising us.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.086
Doug, that's it!

20:11.170 --> 20:13.505
What if we surprise the goat?

20:13.589 --> 20:14.590
Yeah!

20:21.513 --> 20:23.724
-Yeah! We did it! -Yeah!

20:24.558 --> 20:26.685
No, no, no, no, no!

20:26.768 --> 20:28.145
Doug, look.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.855
The card's ruined!

20:29.938 --> 20:32.858
It'll never cheer up Nana like this.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.820
Well, bust my buttons, it's Doug and Emma.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.322
You came to visit us.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.408
Yeah. Nana seemed so sad.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.994
We wanted to cheer her up. Only...

20:44.077 --> 20:47.581
Isn't that just sweeter than a porch full of pies?

20:47.664 --> 20:48.749
Follow me.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.294
Nana, look who's here to see you.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.921
Hey, Nana.

20:54.838 --> 20:55.881
Doug and Emma!

20:57.674 --> 20:59.468
What a nice surprise!

20:59.551 --> 21:02.763
We knew you were sad because you couldn't visit Rebots,

21:02.846 --> 21:05.057
so we made a card to pick you up.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.141
Only...

21:07.309 --> 21:08.727
it got ruined.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.938
By a goat.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.022
A goat?

21:12.105 --> 21:14.691
Well, what was it supposed to look like?

21:15.150 --> 21:20.781
Well, first we rebooted the paper, and then Doug wrote a message inside.

21:20.864 --> 21:25.285
"Dear Nana, Beep beep boop, beep boop boop beep."

21:25.953 --> 21:28.622
Doug. That's lovely.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.083
And then we found your favorite flower.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.210
It was supposed to be a daisy.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.295
It was so pretty.

21:35.963 --> 21:37.297
A daisy!

21:37.381 --> 21:41.552
The flower your grandbot gave me the day we met.

21:41.635 --> 21:44.555
Yeah, best day of my robo-life.

21:45.013 --> 21:48.433
And then I painted a picture of a starry sky on the front.

21:48.517 --> 21:51.937
And in beautiful blue. My favorite color.

21:52.020 --> 21:56.024
Yeah. Sorry it's all chewed up and slobbery, Nana.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.735
We'll understand if you're still sad.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.529
Doug.

22:00.612 --> 22:04.032
All the thought you kids put into making this card

22:04.116 --> 22:07.286
and coming all the way out here to deliver it?

22:07.870 --> 22:11.039
I feel so loved and cared for.

22:11.123 --> 22:15.627
Doug! Project Pick-Me-Up is a success.

22:15.711 --> 22:19.298
Yeah. And I learned that the real pick-me-up

22:19.381 --> 22:22.759
was letting Nana know how much we love and care for her.

22:22.843 --> 22:26.346
You know, Doug, picking Nana up picked me up too.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.390
Yeah. I'm feeling better myself.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.186
I guess he's feeling picked up too.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.240
Yeah, pick me up

22:45.324 --> 22:46.783
Pick me up Yeah

22:48.160 --> 22:49.369
Yeah, pick me up

22:49.453 --> 22:50.913
Pick me up Yeah

22:52.581 --> 22:56.668
I was feeling sad Until you came along

22:57.169 --> 23:02.216
Now I'm happy Singing this song
