07:17.070 --> 07:19.306
ON THE LOWER SIDE
OF THE COUNTY FOR NARCOTICS

07:19.406 --> 07:21.609
AND I WAS THE MAN
WITH THE BATTERING RAM.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.977
AND UPON SWINGING,
THERE WAS A GLASS INLAY

07:24.077 --> 07:25.579
THAT SHATTERED
AND IT PRETTY MUCH CUT

07:25.679 --> 07:27.280

07:44.097 --> 07:46.767
I THINK HE SPOTTED MY VEHICLE
BACK AT THE OFF RAMP.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.269

GO RIGHT, BUT HE TURNED LEFT.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.638

WHERE'D HE GO?
HEY, GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.856
GET IN THE CAR,
GET IN THE CAR,
GET IN THE CAR.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.658
-(jazz music plays)

08:17.865 --> 08:19.633
-NOBODY IN THE CAR.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.573
WHERE'D HE GO?

08:28.308 --> 08:30.277
WATCH OUT,
WATCH OUT,
WATCH OUT.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.047
WHERE? WHERE YOU AT?

08:34.147 --> 08:36.349
COPY. YOU 69?

08:36.449 --> 08:38.586
-Radio: (indistinct)
-ALL RIGHT.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.087
WE'RE HEADED BACK
TO THE TRUCK.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.956
PENNINGTON GOT HIM
OFF OF ELM STREET.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.692
67-1.

08:44.792 --> 08:48.295
I'M GONNA GO BACK
AND MAKE SURE
THIS LADY UP HERE IS OKAY.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.265
DROPPED HIS HAT TOO.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.206
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
-Woman: I'M FINE.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.842
-ARE YOU HURT?
-NO, HE JUST SCARED ME TO DEATH.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.410
-HOW BAD?

09:03.510 --> 09:05.879
-I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S DRIVABLE.

09:05.979 --> 09:09.516
I MEAN, IT CAN PROBABLY
BE PUSHED DOWN.
-OKAY.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.619
WHEN HE HIT YOU, WHAT--
DID HE SAY ANYTHING

09:11.652 --> 09:14.822
OR HE JUST HOPPED OUT AND RAN?
-HE JUST HOPPED AND RAN.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.524
I COULDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.660
-THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT HIM.
-OH, THANK YOU.ú

09:19.760 --> 09:21.494
-WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?

09:21.629 --> 09:23.196
-I CAME OVER HERE
'CAUSE I FIGURED

09:23.296 --> 09:24.632
HE WAS GONNA GO
TO THIS NEXT STREET OVER

09:24.665 --> 09:26.634
AND AS I'M LOOKING
DOWN THE ROAD,

09:26.700 --> 09:28.501
HE RUNS RIGHT PAST MY CAR.
I GET OUT AND CHASE HIM.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.237
STARTED CHASING HIM
FOR A LITTLE BIT
AND HE JUST--

09:30.337 --> 09:32.405
KIND OF JUST STOPPED.
-HE FINALLY STOPPED
AND GAVE UP.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.408
DID HE-- HE PRETTY MUCH
RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.045
-YEAH, HE RECOGNIZED
IT BACK THERE
AT 77TH AND LEESBOROUGH.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.480
-YEAH, WHEN HE DECIDED
HE WAS GONNA WEAVE
IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC,

09:40.648 --> 09:43.083
DO STUPID STUFF TO TRY
AND GET AWAY FROM US.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.985
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THIS DUDE'S PROBLEM IS.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.654
THIS IS THE DRIVER
OF THE CAR HERE.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.221
SOMEONE WE'RE
VERY FAMILIAR WITH.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.690
SOMEONE WHO DRIVES
THIS CAR EVERYWHERE.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.292
WE KNOW HIM ALL TOO WELL
AND HE DECIDED HE WANTED
TO RUN FROM US.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.363
THIS IS YOUR UNLUCKY DAY.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.299
YOU WANNA TALK TO ME?
WHAT'S UP? WHAT HAPPENED?
-WHAT'S UP, MAN? Y'ALL--

09:59.399 --> 10:00.668
MAN, Y'ALL KEEP (bleep)
WITH ME, MAN!

10:00.768 --> 10:02.502
WHY Y'ALL KEEP (bleep)
WITH ME, MAN?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.104
WHY'D YOU WANT
TO PULL ME OVER, MAN?

10:04.204 --> 10:06.273
YOU MEANT THAT!
-ALL RIGHT, WELL...

10:06.373 --> 10:08.776
WELL, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
I DIDN'T PUT ANY
BLUE LIGHTS ON YOU.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.543
YOU JUST DECIDED
YOU WERE JUST GONNA TAKE OFF.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.246
-MAN, YOU PUT BLUE LIGHTS
ON, MAN. YOU PUT BLUE LIGHTS ON.
-I PUT...

10:13.346 --> 10:15.816
I PUT BLUE LIGHTS ON
SO I COULD TRY TO
CATCH UP TO YOU.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.085
-WHO? WHO YOU TALKIN' BOUT?
-YOU!

10:18.185 --> 10:19.987
WHY'D YOU RUN?

10:20.087 --> 10:22.422
-WHO? WHAT?
-WHY'D YOU RUN?

10:22.522 --> 10:24.992
-NAH, I DIDN'T RAN.
-YOU DIDN'T RUN?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.394
-NO. NO, MAN. Y'ALL JUST
KEEP MESSING WITH ME, MAN.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.697
-BUT IF I...
IF I NOTICE CORRECTLY,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.098
THIS IS YOUR HAT.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.365
OH, THIS BELONGS TO YOU?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.401
THIS HAT BELONGS TO YOU?
THIS HAT WAS...

10:34.501 --> 10:37.037
THIS HAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE
BACK OVER THERE,

10:37.137 --> 10:38.538
JUST IN THE DIRECTION
THAT YOU RAN.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.408
AND THEN YOU RAN
ACROSS MY PARTNER'S CAR
BACK OVER HERE.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.243
SO YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.545
-NO, HOW 'BOUT YOU ASK
YOUR PARTNER HOW HE JUST BEAT ME
THE (bleep) UP FOR NOTHING.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.080
-NO, MY PARTNER DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO YOU.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.016
MY PARTNER DETAINED YOU
BECAUSE YOU WERE
RUNNING FROM US.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.483
-MAN, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.385
YOU TELL HIM THAT
I AIN'T RUNNING--
-WHY DID YOU RUN?

10:52.485 --> 10:55.555
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG?
-I GOT NO (bleep) RIGHTS, MAN,

10:55.655 --> 10:57.357
AND I'M TIRED OF GOING TO JAIL.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.826
I JUST WENT TO JAIL
FOR NOTHING, MAN.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.493
I DON'T SELL
NO (bleep) DOPE, MAN.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.229
ALL I DO IS
SMOKE (bleep) WEED.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.732
-YOU JUST WENT TO JAIL
FOR HAVING MARIJUANA
ON YOUR PERSON.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.166
-THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
ALL I DO IS SMOKE WEED.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.068
Y'ALL TWO MOTHER (bleep)
WAITING FOR A (indistinct), MAN.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.803
WHY? I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.604
I DON'T (bleep).
THE ONLY THING
I DO IS, MAN,

11:11.739 --> 11:13.640
WRONG IS DRIVING
UNDER SUSPENSION, MAN.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.442
THAT'S THE ONLY (bleep)
THING I DO WRONG.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.044
-THAT'S ILLEGAL.
DON'T-- YOU CAN'T DO IT.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.847
YOU CAN'T DRIVE,
YOU CAN'T HAVE DRUGS.
DON'T DO IT!

11:19.947 --> 11:21.281
IF YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE
UNDER SUSPENSION,

11:21.381 --> 11:23.751
YOU GOTTA BE A MAN ABOUT YOURS
AND TAKE YOUR PUNISHMENT, MAN.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.618
IF YOU GONNA GET THAT TICKET,
GET THAT TICKET.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.888
DON'T RUN FROM US,
OR YOU WRECK.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.490
YOU HIT THIS PERSON.
YOU COULD'VE HURT HER SERIOUSLY.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.360
YOU RUN, YOU GOT US
CHASING AFTER YOU, GUNS OUT.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.062
I MEAN, COME ON,
MAN, FOR WHAT?

11:35.162 --> 11:36.764
-MAN, I PANICKED.
-YOU PANICKED?

11:36.830 --> 11:40.100
-I (bleep) PANICKED, MAN...
I PUT THIS ON MY (bleep)
WIFE, MAN.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.869
I (bleep) PANICKED, MAN.
I DID.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.636
LISTEN, MAN.
WHY DON'T YOU HELP ME, MAN?

11:43.771 --> 11:44.972
I'M IN SOME REAL

11:45.072 --> 11:46.673
HELP ME, MR. (indistinct)
MAN, I SWEAR, MAN.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.608
-JUST SIT TIGHT, MAN.

11:48.776 --> 11:49.910
JUST RELAX. RELAX.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.644
SLOW YOUR...
SLOW DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.482
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE,
WE KNOW HIM WELL.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.284
ARRESTED HIM
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO

11:57.384 --> 11:58.986
AND APPARENTLY,
HE JUST FEELS LIKE

11:59.086 --> 12:01.454
WE'RE HARASSING HIM,
BUT, YOU KNOW, AND,
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

12:01.554 --> 12:04.624
WE KNOW HE'S
A WELL KNOWN DRUG DEALER

12:04.792 --> 12:06.827
IN THAT AREA
WHERE HE WAS

12:06.927 --> 12:09.296
AND ON THE LOWER
SIDE DOWN HERE.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.431
E.M.S. CHECK YOU OUT
AND EVERYTHING'S GOOD?

12:11.531 --> 12:13.633
-YEAH, I SIGNED OFF. I'M GOOD.
-OKAY.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.936
-SO YOU DON'T NEED TO GET
TRANSPORTED OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT NOW?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.805
-NO.
-WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?
WHERE WERE YOU...

12:17.905 --> 12:19.106
WHEN IT HAPPENED?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.975
-I WAS SECOND BACK
FROM THE RED LIGHT

12:22.075 --> 12:23.376
AND IT JUST TURNED GREEN.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.378
-MM-HMM.
-AND ERNEST WAS IN FRONT OF ME.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.679
HE'S A CO-WORKER.
-OKAY.

12:26.814 --> 12:30.383
-HE HAD TURNED
AND I'D SEEN TRAFFIC COMING

12:30.483 --> 12:33.453
AND I HEARD SOME SCREECHING
AND I STOPPED.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.556
-OKAY.
-I JUST MOVED UP
JUST A TINY BIT

12:36.656 --> 12:38.926
AND I STOPPED
RIGHT WHERE I WAS...
-MM-HMM.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.594
AND I'D SEEN HE TRIED
TO MAKE THAT TURN

12:41.694 --> 12:43.730
AND I KNEW HE WASN'T
GONNA MAKE IT.
-OKAY.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.532
-AND HE RAN RIGHT INTO ME.
-RAN RIGHT INTO YOU?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.500
WHEN HE GOT OUT
OF THE VEHICLE AND RAN,

12:47.600 --> 12:48.936
DID HE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU?
-NO.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.071
HE JUST LOOKED AT ME
AND TOOK OFF.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.206
-AND HE JUST
TOOK OFF, HUH?
HIGHWAY'S EN ROUTE.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.108
THEY'RE COMING HERE
'CAUSE THEY HAVE TO
WORK THE ACCIDENT.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.878
-RIGHT.
-SO, OF COURSE, HIS INSURANCE,
'CAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE,

12:57.978 --> 12:59.947
HE'S LIVING LIFE LARGE, SO...

13:00.047 --> 13:03.083
HIS INSURANCE WILL BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT.
-OKAY.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.518
-LISTEN, ALL RIGHT?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.987
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANNA SAY?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.289
NO, MAN. I DON'T HAVE NOTHING
I AIN'T EVER WANT TO SAY.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.758
-DID YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
TO THE WOMAN THAT YOU HIT?

13:11.859 --> 13:13.894
-I DON'T WANT TO SAY
NOTHING TO NOBODY.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.562
-YOU DON'T WANT--
-I HIT NOBODY.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.865
-(scoffs) YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT THEN.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.366
YOU KNOW YOU AIN'T
GOT NO LICENSE,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.401
SO YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GETTING CHARGED
FOR DRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION

13:21.501 --> 13:23.170
OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.072
YOU'RE ALSO GETTING CHARGED
FOR FAILURE TO STOP
FOR BLUE LIGHTS AND SIRENS.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.440
JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.179
-Officer Linn:
I GREW UP
IN POCATELLO, IDAHO.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.015
MY FATHER WAS
A LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER OVER THERE.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.549
HE WAS MY ROLE MODEL.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.651
SO EVERYTHING THAT
MY DAD WAS DOING

13:38.751 --> 13:41.221
AND HOW HE DID IT,
I TOOK TO HEART

13:41.321 --> 13:43.456
AND ULTIMATELY FOLLOWED
A LOT OF HIS EXAMPLE.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.360
-(police radio chatter)

13:47.460 --> 13:49.796
-SO, I'M BEHIND
A VEHICLE RIGHT NOW

13:49.897 --> 13:52.299
THAT'S GOT NO LICENSE PLATES,

13:52.399 --> 13:55.002
BUT IT'S GOT WHAT WOULD LOOK
LIKE A TEMPORARY REGISTRATION.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.137
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN HANDMADE, SO...

13:57.237 --> 13:59.739
GONNA INITIATE
A STOP UP HERE
AND CONTACT THE DRIVER

13:59.907 --> 14:01.975
AND TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THIS PLATE.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.147
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE LICENSE PLATE HERE?

14:07.247 --> 14:08.615
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE
ON YOUR CAR.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.650
-I JUST GOT THE CAR YESTERDAY.
IT'S THE BILL OF SALE.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.285
-SO YOU HAVE NOT
REGISTERED IT, OBVIOUSLY?

14:12.385 --> 14:14.922
-I HAVEN'T-- NO, I HAVE NOT.
THEY WERE NOT OPEN.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.290
-OKAY. DO YOU HAVE
A DRIVERS LICENSE?
-YES, I DO.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.826
-OKAY. IS IT IN YOUR WALLET
OR IS IT SOMEWHERE ELSE?
-IT'S RIGHT HERE.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.729
-ARE YOU ON PROBATION
OR PAROLE RIGHT NOW?
-NO, I AM NOT.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.098
-OKAY. I SEE YOUR INMATE
CARD THERE. IS THAT...

14:25.198 --> 14:26.799
-I'M TOPPED OUT.
-YOU'RE TOPPED OUT?

14:26.934 --> 14:29.136
WHAT'D YOU DO TIME FOR?
-FORGERY.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.538
-FORGERY? SO DO YOU HAVE
INSURANCE AT ALL ON THE CAR?

14:31.638 --> 14:34.274
-NO, IT HASN'T...
HASN'T GONE OVER YET.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.377
-SO, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU'VE DONE ANY DRUGS?

14:37.477 --> 14:40.547
-UH... IT'S BEEN YEARS.
-YEARS?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.350
OKAY... WHEN YOU WERE
USING DRUGS, WHAT WAS IT
YOU WERE USING?

14:43.450 --> 14:46.219
-UH... MARIJUANA.
-WEED? OKAY.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.855
I GOTTA VERIFY
THE VIN ON THE VEHICLE,

14:48.956 --> 14:50.790
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY
WEAPONS ON YOU? REAL QUICK.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.826
-NO, I... UH...
-WITHOUT REACHING.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.163
-I'M NOT REACHING.
I'M LOOKING TO SEE
IF MY KNIFE WAS ON MY SIDE.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.499
-OKAY, DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE A KNIFE ON YOU?
-UM... MIGHT BE A YES.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.402
-OKAY. SO WHY DON'T
YOU SET YOUR--
-CENTER... CENTER CONSOLE.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.371
-OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU SET
YOUR WALLET ON THE DASH

15:04.471 --> 15:06.206
AND JUST PUT THE CIGARETTE
DOWN ON THE GROUND.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.375
GO AHEAD AND STICK
YOUR RIGHT HAND
BEHIND YOUR HEAD,

15:08.475 --> 15:11.378
YOUR LEFT ONE OUT THE WINDOW.
YOUR LEFT ONE OUT THE WINDOW.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.546
-I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHY--
-OKAY. YOU'RE GOOD, MAN.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.747
JUST GO WITH THIS.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.516
WE'RE GONNA ASK
YOU TO STEP OUT.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.685
JUST KEEP THAT HAND--
-MY PHONE FELL
ON THE FLOOR.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.753
-GO AHEAD AND REACH DOWN
AND PUT THAT PHONE...

15:20.853 --> 15:23.023
-I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHY I'M...

15:23.123 --> 15:26.226
GETTING... OUCH.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.028
-ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE GOOD, MAN.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.563
OKAY.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.000
-I GOT MY TITLE ACTUALLY
IN THE HOUSE RIGHT THERE, MAN.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.702
-ALL RIGHT. LET'S COME BACK HERE
AND SIT ON THE FRONT
OF MY CAR, OKAY?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.204
-OKAY.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.606
-JUST HAVE A SEAT RIGHT THERE.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.475
CROSS YOUR FEET
FOR ME, PLEASE. OKAY.
-NOT A PROBLEM.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.011
-SO AGAIN, REGISTRATION.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.013
YOU MADE UP
A REGISTRATION,
IT LOOKS LIKE,

15:46.113 --> 15:48.248
OR YOU PUT IT ON--
THE DATE ON THE BILL OF SALE.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.582
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
-YEAH.

15:49.682 --> 15:53.253
-OKAY, SO I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS CAR IS LEGITIMATE
OR NOT.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.088
-MOM, CAN YOU GRAB MY TITLE?

15:55.188 --> 15:57.857
-OKAY, SO THEY'VE
HAD IT HOW LONG?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.192
-I JUST BOUGHT
THE CAR YESTERDAY.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.793
-YESTERDAY? OKAY.
-YEAH.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.230
SO I'M... I'M STILL
