WEBVTT

00:01.900 --> 00:06.400
I didn't kill her. She was alive when
I left the house. I hitched a lift.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.270
Find that man. He can prove it.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.550
The fact that I'm too late
for Jack is unbearable,

00:13.600 --> 00:14.670
but I can clear his name.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.510
You're not fantasising or seeing things?

00:19.120 --> 00:22.390
They're all in on it,
every bloody one of them.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.870
I could have killed her
that night for what she did.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.310
- What are you going to say?
- Might spill my guts, tell it all.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.310
The only thing you have to do tomorrow is to
come to church and put a ring on this finger.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.670
You were riding Leo like a seaside
donkey while Rachel was still alive.

00:35.720 --> 00:36.750
Morning, Mr Argyll.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.350
FILTH!

00:38.400 --> 00:43.030
You built a nuclear bunker in the
cellar in case the bombs start
falling, so I know you're a mess.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.630
You won't break me, Jack.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.030
She's a thirsty old horse, isn't she?

00:47.080 --> 00:48.310
Nasty boy.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.030
He's very keen on neglected children.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.710
A bit too old for you, though, aren't I?

00:52.760 --> 00:56.470
One word against me, and I shall
have his head kicked in half.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.400
Bellamy -- he arrested Jack.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.120
He said Jack had done it.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

02:46.320 --> 02:47.960
Jack shouldn't be dead.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.360
He shouldn't have been charged
-- shouldn't have been inside.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.360
Why is he dead?

03:05.360 --> 03:07.400
Jack! Hester!

03:25.680 --> 03:27.080
Where are you going?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.400
Has Philip rung for me?

03:32.160 --> 03:34.720
Er... I didn't hear him.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.000
You look terrible.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.480
So do you.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.990
All of you.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.750
You've been fighting.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.640
And talking. We've been talking.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.360
No more secrets.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.390
Here he is! Ah!

04:05.080 --> 04:07.150
Ah, you've grown.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.070
Look at you! Went away
a boy, came back a man.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.790
- Ah! How many Chinese
communists did you kill? - Stop!

04:12.840 --> 04:16.190
What have you been up to? You're
looking way too pleased with yourself.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.670
Ask Mrs Gould. Mother is furious,

04:17.720 --> 04:19.430
but of course, she's smiling though it.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.310
Yeah, well, you want to watch yourself.
One of these days she'll snap,

04:22.360 --> 04:24.990
lock you in a nuclear bunker
and throw away the key.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.750
Come on, soldier boy. We've got beers.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.750
Guess what -- we're going swimming!

04:30.800 --> 04:32.950
Here we go.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.110
Hey, hey, hey!

05:17.840 --> 05:20.760
Nothing changes, Mickey.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.000
Absolutely nothing at all.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.350
You want to live in a bedsit.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.800
I have found one I like.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.640
And I can afford it.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.800
I'm incredibly proud of you, Christina.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.960
You and Michael.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.600
You've both done very well.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.950
You know, he seems... more... at ease.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.080
With the world.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.520
Has he met a nice girl?

06:21.360 --> 06:22.990
Not that I know of.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.950
And you? Do you have
your eye on a young man?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.680
I'll want to meet him, you know.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.040
I'm so busy at work.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.480
I don't have time for anything like that.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.550
Well --

06:39.600 --> 06:44.070
I'm certain this bedsit will be
hideous, but you know your own mind.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.480
Now, I've got a lot to do, so run along.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.070
Oh, mother.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.430
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
mmm! None of that silliness.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.400
I've trained you better than that.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.350
Breathe.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.070
Remember to breathe.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.040
Did you come to tell us something?

08:05.880 --> 08:08.520
We understand how it
could happen with Mother.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.640
Especially that night.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.560
Anyone can snap, Kirsten.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.220
And Mother pushed people.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.440
She pushed all of us.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.820
If you're going to be mediocre,
Hester, at least look pretty.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.080
Slouching is ugly. Sit up.

08:53.920 --> 08:58.640
"Dear Mother, I'm sorry I'm never
going to be good enough for you.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.000
"I can't live here any more.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.950
"I will ring every Friday at
three, so that nobody worries.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.720
"I want Kirsten to answer.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.640
"Please don't look for me.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.440
"You won't find me."

09:22.840 --> 09:25.390
- Hester?
- 'I'm well, don't worry.'

09:25.440 --> 09:30.230
Hester, please come home. Please,
we miss you so much, so much.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.150
Do you have to sound so desperate?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.720
You're playing right into her hands.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.950
I never heard her say a kind thing to you.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.430
Not even please or thank you.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.920
Just orders, clicking her fingers.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.640
We don't hate you, Kirsten.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.720
We could never hate you.

10:07.760 --> 10:08.840
You might.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.720
I don't know what I'm
going to say to Mary.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.120
I hope she doesn't want to see him.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.160
I had to see Rachel...

10:27.880 --> 10:30.600
.. and it'll never leave me -- her face.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.280
Like that. You know?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.960
This is supposed to be my wedding day.

10:53.800 --> 10:58.190
Mr Argyll? Is all of this
happening because of me?

10:58.240 --> 10:59.870
I only wanted to do what was right,

10:59.920 --> 11:01.870
but I seem to have set something off.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.400
It's not you, Arthur.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.120
All this happened a long time ago.

11:08.200 --> 11:13.240
It's only now it seems that
everything's coming home to roost.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.640
Mary!

11:24.800 --> 11:27.640
Smile, Mother, so
everyone knows we're happy.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.760
These are your new sisters and brother.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.630
Darling, I'm here!

11:55.680 --> 11:58.390
Right! Mary, have they wiped their feet?

11:58.440 --> 11:59.830
Argh!

11:59.880 --> 12:03.270
Everything hurts him.
Please, just don't jolt him.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.350
ARGH! You fucking morons!

12:06.400 --> 12:08.070
Welcome home, Philip.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.280
Be careful! Please, just be careful.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.270
Last post.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.320
- Take charge of that, before
I lose my mind. - [ARGH!]

12:18.240 --> 12:19.480
[SLOW DOWN!]

12:28.880 --> 12:30.960
[ARGH!]

13:19.040 --> 13:20.360
Mickey!

13:22.920 --> 13:25.510
Oh, Mickey!

13:25.560 --> 13:27.960
Mickey, I'm drunk, and I
need to sleep on your floor.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.600
Mickey!

15:18.480 --> 15:19.640
Where's Hester?

15:21.360 --> 15:23.000
She went to the laundry.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.680
You have got to be the mother.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.920
Here... is a cheque...

15:33.880 --> 15:35.000
.. for £500.

15:36.120 --> 15:41.120
You take it on the understanding that
you never contact my daughter again.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.000
Hmm!

17:24.599 --> 17:26.710
Where's Simon?

17:26.760 --> 17:30.480
He's gone to get eggs and
bread, so we can have breakfast.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.320
I'm not cross, Hester.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.430
- You're not?
- It's Christmas Eve.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.720
How can I be cross?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.800
Sugar milk. Your favourite.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.640
- I don't feel very well.
- Hold on tight.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.150
One step at a time.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.880
Good girl. Good girl.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.520
Come on.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.910
Steady. Come on.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.150
Keep going, there's a good girl.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.320
Nearly there.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.630
She's been involved in
an unfortunate liaison.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.950
I want her examined.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.510
I want to know if she's
carrying the expected result

18:48.560 --> 18:49.830
of such a liaison.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.400
And if she is?

19:25.520 --> 19:26.560
Well?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.510
About three months. May I...?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.830
Have the porters bring her to my car,

19:32.880 --> 19:34.980
and burn the clothes that she was wearing.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.790
♪ I'm dreaming

19:46.720 --> 19:50.600
♪ Of a White Christmas

19:53.000 --> 19:58.470
♪ Just like the ones I used to know

20:00.840 --> 20:03.270
♪ Where the tree tops glisten... ♪

20:03.320 --> 20:05.000
Why are you crying?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.910
♪ And children listen...

20:10.960 --> 20:12.750
I want Daddy.

20:12.800 --> 20:18.000
♪ To hear sleigh bells in the snow... ♪

20:27.120 --> 20:31.270
Hester's in the car. Tell
everyone she has flu.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.590
Only you and I can nurse her.

20:33.640 --> 20:37.190
- Why? - Get her in.
Put her straight to bed.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.520
Go.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.800
Christina, it's Mother.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.480
Come to the house. Find
Michael and bring him, too.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.160
You tracked her down, then.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.280
I hope she told you to piss off.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
- Mother!
- Where the hell are you?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.120
Leo?

23:02.120 --> 23:03.240
Oh, shit!

23:04.440 --> 23:05.710
Oh, Christ.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.390
No, Leo. Just your wife.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.310
I'll talk to you in your study,

23:09.360 --> 23:12.360
but first, I want a word
with you, Miss Vaughan.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.120
Naughty Daddy!

23:19.200 --> 23:20.360
Yours, I believe.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.750
You're nothing special, Gwenda.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.270
He's done this before.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.750
My husband has a predilection
for screwing the staff.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.510
The plainer the better.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.430
I suppose he thinks it'll
make them more grateful.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.990
I'm not the grateful one.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.390
Sometimes, he cries.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.840
Argh!

23:42.000 --> 23:43.790
You ordinary bitch.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.340
Put your cheap knickers on
and get out of my house.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.180
You know, I never really enjoy Christmas, but
this one's shaping up to be a real belter.

24:14.680 --> 24:15.640
Hester?

24:17.360 --> 24:19.590
Leave me alone, Jack.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.200
She's... has a fever. It's flu.

24:26.040 --> 24:30.040
Don't worry. All right. There
we go. Good girl. I've got you.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.750
I've got you.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.320
I'm divorcing you, Leo.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.760
You won't do that.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.630
You couldn't bear the shame.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.190
Oh, I'll cope.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.830
But you, with your easy life

24:49.880 --> 24:53.800
and your bloody book that
no-one wants or cares about...

24:57.000 --> 24:58.630
You'll be penniless.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.390
You'll have to work for a living.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.800
How will you cope?

25:07.640 --> 25:10.230
Mother? Philip can't live upstairs.

25:10.280 --> 25:14.030
- We need to arrange the house, so he has his
own rooms. - Stop pulling. I can't bear it.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.950
Always pulling at me! It's intolerable!

25:17.000 --> 25:18.200
Why did you get me?

25:24.280 --> 25:28.640
Why did you get me, if you
weren't going to love me?

25:30.680 --> 25:32.280
I was sad, Mary.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.720
I thought you could
make up for that sadness.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.160
It's not your fault you couldn't.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.320
God almighty, Mother.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.920
- Is she settled?
- I'm getting her a hot water bottle.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.950
You're leaving, Jack.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Michael and Christina
are coming to get you.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.080
Have a drink, Mother.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.470
Ah!

26:40.520 --> 26:42.470
- You're going to need one.
- I don't want a drink.

26:42.520 --> 26:46.390
They've always been close,
haven't they? Tina and Mickey?

26:46.440 --> 26:47.600
Mickey and Tina.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.560
So close.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.240
I suppose it was inevitable.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.160
They're at each other.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.800
Lovers. I...

27:05.640 --> 27:07.480
I saw them.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.950
His hands all over her.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.550
Her legs wrapped round his back.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.120
"Ah, ah!"

27:19.440 --> 27:21.080
I'm not going anywhere.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.440
There's no getting rid of me.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.840
Aw. Poor Mother.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.600
You should have left me at the orphanage.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.560
I didn't get you from an orphanage.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.440
The woman who gave birth
to you is in the kitchen.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.480
You've known her all your life.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.950
Little boy.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.880
With your temper tantrums.

27:57.160 --> 28:00.720
You've no idea what it
takes to keep going.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.880
I'm going to adopt the baby, Kirsten.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.760
My child, but you won't be separated.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.510
No-one will ever know.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.710
I thought you were going to send me away.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.600
None of this is your fault, Kirsten.

28:33.640 --> 28:34.760
None of it.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.680
Did you want something to eat?

28:58.400 --> 29:00.680
I'm just going to sit here for a bit.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.230
Park on the road. Christina,
meet me in the garden room.

29:37.280 --> 29:42.710
- And Michael, you stay in the car. - I'll
walk with you. - Do as I say. It's important.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.120
It's Jack, isn't it?

29:45.480 --> 29:46.640
Of course it's Jack.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.800
I wish he'd stop baiting her.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.870
I'm done with this. I'm
done with all of it.

29:52.920 --> 29:56.950
I'm done with her. Her mad
rules, her mad bloody bunker.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.950
Everything. I'm done.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.040
Mickey, don't. She loves us really.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.160
Say please.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.630
For once in your life.

30:06.680 --> 30:07.880
Say it!

30:11.200 --> 30:12.520
Please.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.840
There we go.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.950
Wasn't that hard, was it?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.950
Keep that up -- we might get on better.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.270
When you were in Korea,

30:22.320 --> 30:26.440
I prayed day and night that
you would come home safely.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.560
So did I.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.640
Who'd have thought we'd
have something in common?

30:39.640 --> 30:42.720
See, Mother -- we're
getting on better already.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.670
Wouldn't he marry you?

30:53.720 --> 30:56.000
What? Who?

30:57.160 --> 30:59.260
When you told him you
were having a baby...

31:02.000 --> 31:03.440
.. wouldn't he marry you?

31:12.880 --> 31:15.150
It... wasn't like that.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.840
Is it because of him
that I am the way I am?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.640
Not knowing when to stop.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.960
Am I like him?

31:32.440 --> 31:33.520
I don't... I can't...

31:35.560 --> 31:37.680
You have to take that to Hester.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.080
- Are you coming back?
- Of course I am.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.720
How did you bear it?

31:54.880 --> 31:55.920
I just...

31:58.640 --> 31:59.800
.. did.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.910
Jesus!

33:01.320 --> 33:02.990
What is it?

33:03.040 --> 33:05.350
You found Michael quickly.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.910
He was already with me.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.790
Wrapping presents.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.000
How fortuitous.

33:11.080 --> 33:15.200
Jack tells me that you and Michael are...

33:16.240 --> 33:17.440
.. involved.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.640
With each other.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.480
Tell me it isn't true.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.720
I can't.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.360
God.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.720
The love...

33:47.320 --> 33:52.080
.. the love I've wasted on you, you whore!

33:53.920 --> 33:56.670
You're disgusting, you repulse me.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.550
So ugly, so stupid.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.150
You are an abomination. You disgust me.

34:02.200 --> 34:08.400
You are filth, filth,
filth, filth, filth, FILTH!

34:12.159 --> 34:15.190
Where's Jack? What has he done?

34:15.239 --> 34:17.679
Jack saw us. He told her.

34:18.840 --> 34:22.750
Well, she was going to have to find out
sooner or later, wasn't she, eh? Everyone was.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.469
- We're disgusting. We're filth.
- No. No.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.909
- No. We're not.
- We're stupid and ugly and dirty.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.190
Listen to me. Listen to me.

34:30.239 --> 34:32.989
We're not any of those things.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.639
Don't run. Don't run.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.840
Let me go! Let me go!

34:44.679 --> 34:45.960
Don't!

35:05.280 --> 35:09.440
Do you have the time? I'm
supposed to be there by nine.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.720
I believed it was true. We all did.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.040
That Jack had done it.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.960
Because of things that
had happened. Things...

36:06.400 --> 36:08.160
Things that had been said.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.120
And his fingerprints.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.830
They were on what was used
to kill her. On the decanter.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.710
Then the weapon must
have been something else.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.080
It has to have been.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.880
Something... similar.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.840
How is Mrs Durrant taking the news?

36:46.960 --> 36:51.060
I put the coins on his eyes to close them,
so he looked more peaceful when she saw him.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.280
I'll take them off
before she does, though.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.840
There was a needle in his arm.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.040
Poor man.

37:03.320 --> 37:06.070
He can't have realised
how dangerous it was.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.600
Whisky and morphine.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.560
I'm so sorry.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.280
I have to tell to Mary.

37:24.920 --> 37:28.400
I didn't leave Philip's
shot out for him last night.

37:30.720 --> 37:31.880
He was too drunk.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.070
How could he overdose if I
didn't leave him his shot?

37:36.120 --> 37:37.960
It doesn't make any sense.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.200
He can't reach the morphine on his own.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.520
Well?

40:16.600 --> 40:18.320
You said he'd never know.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.280
That no-one would know.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.560
You promised.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.360
I'm sorry.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.400
I... I... I was angry.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.870
I hope he doesn't hate you.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.800
I don't want him to hate you.

40:40.240 --> 40:44.470
None of this your fault,
none of it. None of it.

40:44.520 --> 40:45.960
- Ah!
- Oh, God.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.710
Oh, God.

40:50.760 --> 40:51.990
I'm so sorry.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.870
So sorry.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.110
Ah! I...

40:58.160 --> 41:01.030
I don't know what's happening to me!

41:01.080 --> 41:02.670
I'm... I'm going to get help.

41:02.720 --> 41:06.470
No, no, no, no, no! Don't leave
me! Please don't leave me!

41:06.520 --> 41:07.950
All right.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.480
Don't go. Please don't leave me.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.550
- It's OK. - I'm so
frightened. - Sh, sh, sh.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.720
Please don't leave me.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.880
Little Kirsten.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.520
Rachel?

41:32.080 --> 41:33.680
Rachel?

42:09.480 --> 42:10.870
There, there.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.430
There, there.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.240
There, there.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.630
You say you went home at the usual time.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.830
You didn't see Rachel.

43:02.880 --> 43:06.040
I'll come and get you
when the police have gone.

43:12.880 --> 43:14.110
What were you doing up there?

43:14.160 --> 43:16.030
Making sure there's no-one else upstairs.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.870
Go to your rooms. Do not go downstairs.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.120
Do as you're told!

43:33.960 --> 43:35.280
Jack...

43:36.800 --> 43:38.120
.. was here.

43:49.120 --> 43:53.150
Your fingerprints mixed
with your mother's blood.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.160
No-one else's. Yours, Jack.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.470
All right.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.800
Yeah, let's go to trial.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.830
I've always liked an audience,
and now I'm going to get one.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.550
A packed-out courtroom
to see the bastard boy

44:13.600 --> 44:15.630
go down for murdering his mother.

44:18.240 --> 44:22.750
What everyone will want to know
is, what made him the way he is?

44:22.800 --> 44:27.830
Yeah, "He'd been given everything.
Why did he turn out so vicious?"

44:27.880 --> 44:30.230
It's something in you.
It's your temperament.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.160
Something I've inherited.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.320
- Maybe. Who can say?
- Kirsten can.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.560
Who made me the way I am?

44:42.480 --> 44:43.720
Well, you did.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.950
Daddy.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.760
I've worked it all out.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.200
- You're mistaken.
- She was 15.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.830
Little girl straight out of some home,

44:56.880 --> 44:59.510
little girl with nothing,
come to help with Mary.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.030
You know she told us once

45:01.080 --> 45:04.070
it was the first time she'd
had a room of her own.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.670
And who walks into it? You.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.720
With your cock in your hand.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.270
The murderer's father.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.750
Your blood in my veins.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.710
Oh, I'll take a life sentence for this.

45:16.760 --> 45:20.230
If I get the rope, I'll walk up that
scaffold with a song in my heart.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.480
It'll be worth it.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.840
I'm going to ruin you.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.360
I will sow your fields with salt.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.270
I will drink from your hollowed skull.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.000
I know exactly what you are, Leo Argyll.

45:40.320 --> 45:43.240
By the time I'm done,
so will everyone else.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.440
I am your plague.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.680
And I'm coming for you.

48:41.160 --> 48:43.470
Open the window. Unlock it.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.990
- Open it now.
- Unlock the window. Come out.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.550
- Why?
- Arthur! You're in danger!

48:48.600 --> 48:50.390
We need to get you out.

48:50.440 --> 48:54.470
Through the garden, not out the
front. We can't trust our father.

48:54.520 --> 48:57.470
- Open the window, Arthur.
- I'll get my case.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.400
Forget the case! Arthur!

49:01.480 --> 49:03.350
Oh.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.310
I'm... I'm leaving now.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.840
Well, let me see you to the door.

49:10.760 --> 49:11.960
No.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.510
No!

49:14.560 --> 49:18.110
No, no, no, no, no, no!

49:18.160 --> 49:19.470
No, no, no!

49:19.520 --> 49:21.320
No, no!

49:25.320 --> 49:27.600
No, leave me alone! No!

49:29.080 --> 49:30.680
No! Leave me alone!

49:31.920 --> 49:34.590
Get off me! Leave me alone!

49:34.640 --> 49:35.800
No!

49:46.440 --> 49:49.190
Very professional men. They
know what they're doing.

49:49.240 --> 49:52.000
I'll come and speak with you on the drive.

49:59.360 --> 50:04.550
Calgary did abscond. He
very likely did meet Jack,

50:04.600 --> 50:07.350
but much later than he said.

50:07.400 --> 50:11.110
Jack gave him a time
that would exonerate him.

50:11.160 --> 50:16.590
That fragile young man has
been a stooge, not an alibi.

50:16.640 --> 50:18.910
I'm sorry you had to
listen to all of that.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.840
It's very... upsetting.

50:22.960 --> 50:25.190
So Jack's still guilty.

50:25.240 --> 50:26.670
He still did it.

50:26.720 --> 50:29.110
I'm afraid so.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.640
No-one wanted him to be
innocent more than me.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.630
Mary, I need to speak with you,

50:38.680 --> 50:41.590
and you're going to
have to be a brave girl.

50:41.640 --> 50:45.080
You're going to tell me that
Philip overdosed in the bathroom.

50:47.640 --> 50:48.800
Yes.

50:52.640 --> 50:53.830
Why is he dead?

50:53.880 --> 50:56.230
Well, I'm afraid barbiturates

50:56.280 --> 51:00.750
and whiskey are not a happy combination.

51:00.800 --> 51:01.960
Not Philip.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.480
Jack.

51:07.480 --> 51:09.440
Why is Jack dead?

51:11.760 --> 51:12.920
I told them.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.120
How he was mine.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.880
And yours.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.640
Why is he dead?

51:31.800 --> 51:35.350
He started a fight with another
prisoner. You know this.

51:35.400 --> 51:38.030
But they never found out who killed him.

51:38.080 --> 51:40.110
- No.
- Did they try?

51:40.160 --> 51:44.030
Of course. Good God, what is this?

51:44.080 --> 51:47.430
How did he start the fight?
Someone must have seen.

51:47.480 --> 51:50.070
Maybe he said the wrong
thing to the wrong person.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.070
Did he say the wrong thing to you?

51:52.120 --> 51:54.150
- Did Philip?
- Did mother?

51:54.200 --> 51:56.550
What the hell are you accusing me of?

51:56.600 --> 51:58.470
Have you lost your damn minds?

51:58.520 --> 52:03.510
I keep thinking about what Chief
Constable Gould said to you that time.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.910
What time?

52:04.960 --> 52:08.920
That time he said he'd have
every bone in Jack's body broken.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.960
That he'd have his head kicked in half.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.960
And you didn't say that he shouldn't.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.030
And I keep thinking how
you went to see Jack,

52:24.080 --> 52:25.960
and the next day he was dead.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.800
My baby!

52:35.000 --> 52:36.080
Oh, Kirsten.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.760
How bitter you are.

52:41.520 --> 52:44.590
This is her revenge because
I'm marrying again,

52:44.640 --> 52:46.310
and I haven't chosen her.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.750
I have to speak with Doctor Morsuch,

52:49.800 --> 52:54.520
and then I expect all of you to apologise.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.030
But you -- there's nothing you can say.

53:02.080 --> 53:04.880
Trying to turn my own children against me?

53:07.080 --> 53:08.880
Your life in this house is over.
