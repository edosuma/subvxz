WEBVTT

00:05.480 --> 00:07.658
Thanks for picking me up from work.

00:08.397 --> 00:09.896
No problem.

00:10.766 --> 00:12.199
Do me a favor, little brother.

00:12.201 --> 00:14.635
Pull over up there.
I need to cash my paycheck.

00:14.637 --> 00:16.770
You think it's still open?
It's kind of late.

00:16.772 --> 00:18.472
Trust me, it's open.

00:18.474 --> 00:19.906
Just pull over.

00:19.908 --> 00:21.880
And wait in the car.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:45.100 --> 00:46.733
Just drive, man. Just go.

00:48.604 --> 00:51.438
What are you doing? Go fast.

00:57.379 --> 00:58.612
You okay?

00:58.614 --> 01:00.380
Just drive, man.

01:00.382 --> 01:02.716
Just drive.

01:10.693 --> 01:14.027
Dad, these expire today.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.331
It's fine, honey.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.599
Come on.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.268
I wouldn't feed you spoiled meat.

01:21.270 --> 01:24.838
Mom told me you used to cut mold
off food and eat around it.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.873
Well, maybe when I was a kid.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.709
And I turned out okay, didn't I?

01:31.480 --> 01:34.114
Kristen, the door!

01:40.122 --> 01:42.522
Afternoon, ma'am.

01:42.524 --> 01:43.990
We're looking for George Brown.

01:43.992 --> 01:45.892
I think you must have the wrong house.

01:45.894 --> 01:47.661
Nobody named George Brown lives here.

01:48.217 --> 01:49.730
George Brown?

01:50.427 --> 01:52.132
Are you addressing me?

01:52.134 --> 01:53.734
My name's James Grayson.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.036
Yeah, I'm sure you're right, Mr. Grayson.

01:56.038 --> 01:57.971
Mixups happen all the time.
Could I trouble you

01:57.973 --> 01:59.673
to come down to the local
police station with us

01:59.675 --> 02:01.074
so we can clear this up?

02:01.944 --> 02:03.977
I was barbecuing out back.

02:03.979 --> 02:06.680
- I mean, is this important?
- Actually, we have

02:06.682 --> 02:08.548
an arrest warrant for George Brown

02:08.550 --> 02:10.015
for a murder in Staten Island.

02:10.018 --> 02:13.019
Thing is, all the authorities
involved think he lives here.

02:13.021 --> 02:14.688
I think they think he's you.

02:14.690 --> 02:17.413
Pretty sure you're gonna want to
come with us and clear this up.

02:17.415 --> 02:19.092
Look, II don't know what's going on,

02:19.094 --> 02:20.327
but he's not George Brown.

02:20.329 --> 02:22.929
He's Jim Grayson. James Grayson.

02:22.931 --> 02:27.033
Ma'am, I'd like you
to lower your voice and back up.

02:28.804 --> 02:31.138
Mr. Grayson, you have a nice family here.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.106
You live in a nice neighborhood.

02:33.108 --> 02:35.876
Don't make me come back with
sirens and lights and...

02:35.878 --> 02:37.766
Let's just clear this up.

02:38.514 --> 02:40.013
Are you sure they know

02:40.015 --> 02:41.314
we're just here to file a motion?

02:41.316 --> 02:42.783
We've been sitting here over an hour.

02:42.785 --> 02:44.284
Yeah, I've spoken to everybody.

02:44.286 --> 02:45.983
They all know why we're here.

02:46.655 --> 02:48.855
The next arraignment is for George Brown.

02:48.857 --> 02:50.957
The defendant doesn't have
a lawyer. Mr. ColÃ³n.

02:51.655 --> 02:52.959
Would you be so kind

02:52.961 --> 02:55.095
as to stand in
for Mr. Brown's arraignment?

02:55.534 --> 02:58.565
I love the way they make it
sound like you have a choice.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.200
Yeah.

03:00.202 --> 03:02.569
I'd be, happy to, Your Honor.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.405
Okay...

03:05.407 --> 03:08.141
any family members here for George Brown?

03:08.143 --> 03:09.576
I'm his wife.

03:11.508 --> 03:14.147
I didn't know judges could
just assign lawyers like that.

03:14.149 --> 03:15.282
Are you our lawyer now?

03:15.284 --> 03:17.918
No. No, I'm just standing in

03:17.920 --> 03:20.454
until your husband gets his own attorney.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.422
We only have a few minutes

03:22.424 --> 03:23.890
to try to argue bail.

03:23.892 --> 03:25.125
Is your husband employed?

03:25.127 --> 03:26.430
If so, where?

03:26.432 --> 03:28.895
What's your family life
like? Does he have any friends?

03:28.897 --> 03:32.165
Yes. He owns a restaurant.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.468
He's a devoted father.
We have three kids.

03:34.470 --> 03:36.837
He's in a bowling league.
What else can I tell you?

03:36.839 --> 03:39.307
We just need to establish that
he has roots in the community.

03:39.309 --> 03:41.120
They want to make sure
he's not a flight risk.

03:41.122 --> 03:42.943
So, the police arrested your husband

03:42.945 --> 03:46.580
after looking for this murderer
for 18 years?

03:47.085 --> 03:48.882
Mrs. Grayson, it doesn't seem

03:48.884 --> 03:50.817
like the kind of thing
they would do baselessly.

03:50.819 --> 03:52.652
I don't know what to tell you.

03:52.654 --> 03:53.987
I haven't slept for two days.

03:53.989 --> 03:55.722
I just want my husband to come home.

03:55.724 --> 03:59.793
Look, my kids just want
their dad to come home.

04:07.836 --> 04:09.236
Are you my lawyer?

04:09.238 --> 04:12.305
For the purpose of this brief hearing.

04:12.307 --> 04:13.406
How bad is it?

04:13.408 --> 04:15.242
It's pretty bad.

04:15.244 --> 04:18.144
You're being charged with
a count of felony murder.

04:18.146 --> 04:21.447
You're looking at 25 years to life.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.117
But all I did was drive a car.

04:24.119 --> 04:26.820
Please state your name
for the court record.

04:36.468 --> 04:37.931
George Brown.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.866
How do you plead?

04:39.868 --> 04:42.769
Your Honor, we'd like to
enter a plea of not guilty.

04:42.771 --> 04:45.438
George Brown is a family man,
father of three,

04:45.440 --> 04:47.207
community volunteer,

04:47.209 --> 04:49.209
small business owner,

04:49.211 --> 04:51.599
and he employs seven
people in New Jersey.

04:51.601 --> 04:53.580
Your Honor, 18 years ago,

04:53.582 --> 04:54.981
George Brown was the getaway driver

04:54.983 --> 04:58.318
in a robbery at a Fast Cash
Express check cashing store.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.253
His coconspirator and older brother,

05:00.255 --> 05:03.089
Richard Brown, held up a 25yearold man

05:03.091 --> 05:05.425
by the name of Kirk Getty at gunpoint.

05:05.427 --> 05:07.460
He tied him up, gagged him,

05:07.462 --> 05:09.763
and Mr. Getty asphyxiated to death.

05:09.765 --> 05:14.100
The older Mr. Brown stole $8,000
and fled the scene of the crime.

05:14.798 --> 05:17.170
George Brown drove the getaway vehicle.

05:17.172 --> 05:19.606
Police arrested Richard, or Rick,

05:19.608 --> 05:21.608
a short while later.

05:21.610 --> 05:23.777
He was captured on tape calling George

05:23.779 --> 05:26.046
to tell him where
the stolen money was hidden

05:26.048 --> 05:28.348
and to take the money and flee.

05:28.350 --> 05:31.685
And apparently started a
new life as Jim Grayson.

05:31.687 --> 05:34.287
- Did you know he had a brother?
- No. No. No.

05:34.289 --> 05:36.890
George Brown has been
a fugitive from justice

05:36.892 --> 05:38.358
for 18 years, Your Honor.

05:38.864 --> 05:40.026
His fingerprints,

05:40.028 --> 05:41.728
lifted from the gun used in the robbery,

05:41.730 --> 05:42.929
were in the system

05:42.931 --> 05:45.198
and finally flagged in
New Jersey a few days ago.

05:45.704 --> 05:47.400
He's clearly a flight risk.

05:47.402 --> 05:49.302
And that is why we are
strenuously requesting

05:49.304 --> 05:52.105
that the Court deny Mr. Brown bail.

05:52.107 --> 05:53.940
So ordered.

05:53.942 --> 05:56.009
The defendant is remanded into custody.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.519
I'm so sorry.

06:06.521 --> 06:08.788
So, what happens now?

06:08.790 --> 06:11.925
Now you need to find
a good criminal lawyer,

06:11.927 --> 06:14.427
someone who knows their
way around felony murder.

06:14.429 --> 06:16.763
And where do we find one of those?

06:16.765 --> 06:19.833
When I get back to my office,
I'll email you a few names.

06:19.835 --> 06:22.502
And what about the two of you?

06:22.504 --> 06:25.305
Have you ever defended someone
charged with felony murder?

06:25.952 --> 06:26.873
Yes.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.775
And did you win?

06:28.777 --> 06:30.143
Yes.

06:30.145 --> 06:32.212
So why don't we start with you.

06:32.876 --> 06:35.415
After the fantastic job
we just did for you here?

06:35.921 --> 06:38.051
Apparently, he's been
making them look like fools

06:38.053 --> 06:39.319
for almost 20 years.

06:39.321 --> 06:41.988
I don't think Johnnie Cochran
could have gotten him off.

06:41.990 --> 06:43.456
We own a restaurant.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.291
We can pay you.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.427
Just meet with him.

06:47.429 --> 06:49.162
Listen to his side of the story.

06:49.164 --> 06:51.061
And then if it's not for you...

06:53.902 --> 06:55.602
I'll give him ten minutes.

06:55.604 --> 06:57.776
Thank you. Thank you so much.

07:00.008 --> 07:02.383
This is my boss, Dr. Jason Bull.

07:02.385 --> 07:04.577
Your wife wanted us to meet with you,

07:04.579 --> 07:07.147
hear your story, and see if we might

07:07.149 --> 07:08.662
want to be of help to you.

07:09.351 --> 07:10.956
How's she doing?

07:12.374 --> 07:14.287
About as well as can be expected

07:14.289 --> 07:16.389
given that after ten years of marriage,

07:16.391 --> 07:19.626
she just found out
she doesn't really know you.

07:20.257 --> 07:22.175
She doesn't know your real name.

07:22.931 --> 07:24.831
You want to tell us how you got here?

07:25.470 --> 07:27.500
It's not much of a story.

07:30.305 --> 07:32.739
I was 18 years old.

07:32.741 --> 07:34.474
My older brother had a DUI,

07:34.476 --> 07:36.710
so I was driving him home from work.

07:36.712 --> 07:38.278
He was a janitor.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.068
2:00 to 10:00 at the mall.

07:40.649 --> 07:43.450
He said he wanted to go
to this check cashing place.

07:43.452 --> 07:45.142
Did you go inside?

07:45.144 --> 07:48.021
I think I actually fell asleep
in the car waiting.

07:49.476 --> 07:53.478
I had no idea he was planning
on robbing the place.

07:53.595 --> 07:55.195
And what happened after that?

07:55.197 --> 07:58.131
Right after? A lot of nothing.

07:58.133 --> 08:00.533
Went about my life.
I went to school the next day.

08:00.535 --> 08:01.835
Came home. He wasn't there.

08:01.837 --> 08:03.258
Figured he was at work.

08:04.759 --> 08:07.807
But then I went to pick him up,
and he never came to the car.

08:07.809 --> 08:09.242
He was under arrest?

08:09.244 --> 08:10.410
Turns out he had gagged

08:10.412 --> 08:11.745
the guy behind the counter,

08:11.747 --> 08:13.880
but couldn't tie the gag
with his gloves on,

08:13.882 --> 08:15.161
so he took them off.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.685
Once they had his prints,
it was all over.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.987
And they picked him up at the mall.

08:20.989 --> 08:23.069
I, of course, knew none of this.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.326
Finally, Rick calls me
a couple days later from jail.

08:26.328 --> 08:28.995
Tells me where the money is.
Tells me to take it and run.

08:28.997 --> 08:32.030
So, if all you did was drive the car,

08:32.033 --> 08:34.234
and if you didn't even know
what your brother did

08:34.236 --> 08:36.936
when he was inside
the check cashing store,

08:36.938 --> 08:38.304
why did he tell you to run?

08:38.306 --> 08:39.905
Why didn't you go to the authorities,

08:39.908 --> 08:41.006
tell them your story?

08:41.630 --> 08:44.477
Rick told me the public defender told him

08:45.050 --> 08:47.313
they were about to put out
a warrant for my arrest.

08:47.315 --> 08:48.982
They were convinced
we were in it together.

08:48.984 --> 08:50.717
Something called a joint venture.

08:50.719 --> 08:52.652
In which case,

08:52.654 --> 08:55.421
even though you were
only the getaway driver,

08:55.423 --> 08:56.623
in the eyes of the law,

08:56.625 --> 08:58.525
you're as guilty as the
person who held the gun.

08:59.064 --> 09:02.962
And since someone died,
everyone's charged with murder.

09:04.633 --> 09:06.633
So now you're on the run.

09:08.203 --> 09:10.804
Moved around New England
for about a year.

09:10.806 --> 09:12.238
Slept in bus stations.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.787
Didn't talk to anyone.

09:15.163 --> 09:18.645
And then I met a guy
selling drugs in the bus station

09:18.647 --> 09:20.880
who told me he could get me

09:20.882 --> 09:24.551
a dead person's
Social Security number for $350.

09:26.354 --> 09:29.656
And Jim Grayson was born.

09:31.793 --> 09:33.431
Stupid.

09:33.929 --> 09:35.795
I went to renew my liquor license

09:35.797 --> 09:37.330
about a month ago.

09:37.332 --> 09:38.865
They asked for my prints.

09:38.867 --> 09:40.647
I didn't think a thing about it.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.317
Pretty sure that's what did me in.

09:48.276 --> 09:50.210
Mrs. Grayson?

09:51.112 --> 09:53.079
So, that was an awfully long ten minutes.

09:53.081 --> 09:54.147
How's he doing?

09:55.817 --> 09:57.183
That's funny.

09:57.185 --> 09:59.719
He asked the exact same
question about you.

09:59.721 --> 10:01.721
My sense is that he is overcome

10:01.723 --> 10:05.058
with regret and remorse,

10:05.060 --> 10:08.795
and at the exact same time,
he is angry and bitter

10:08.797 --> 10:11.364
because any logical
examination of the facts

10:11.366 --> 10:12.637
suggests that...

10:13.435 --> 10:15.140
he didn't really do anything.

10:15.503 --> 10:17.170
You sound like you're on his side.

10:17.172 --> 10:19.272
You sound like you believe him.

10:20.976 --> 10:22.609
I guess I do.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.879
Does that mean you'd be willing
to represent him?

10:28.216 --> 10:30.416
I guess it does.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.305
ADA Peluso. Thanks for coming by.

10:44.330 --> 10:45.562
Dr. Bull's expecting you.

10:45.564 --> 10:47.881
Any excuse to get out of the office.

10:48.420 --> 10:51.668
So, I'm guessing we're all here
to talk plea deal?

10:51.670 --> 10:53.103
Well, I can't speak for you,

10:53.105 --> 10:56.607
but Dr. Bull and I are here
to talk about dismissal.

10:56.609 --> 10:59.476
Dismissal?
Well, it's good to have a dream.

11:00.646 --> 11:02.613
Well, the joke's not lost on me,

11:02.615 --> 11:05.382
but let's talk it through for a second.

11:05.384 --> 11:07.151
No matter how you slice it,

11:07.153 --> 11:10.554
prosecuting that man
is still a moral conundrum.

11:11.029 --> 11:14.333
After all, the primary function
of our criminal justice system

11:14.335 --> 11:17.995
is to provide deterrence,
protect society,

11:17.997 --> 11:20.030
punish people who commit crimes,

11:20.032 --> 11:23.467
and rehabilitate criminals
once we have them in custody.

11:23.469 --> 11:25.435
Now, hasn't all of that

11:25.437 --> 11:27.771
already been accomplished
with regard to George Brown?

11:27.773 --> 11:29.640
He's led a successful and productive life

11:29.642 --> 11:30.941
since the robbery.

11:30.943 --> 11:32.843
He's not a danger to society.

11:32.845 --> 11:36.079
And he has no intention
to commit another crime.

11:36.081 --> 11:37.815
So...

11:37.817 --> 11:41.084
what would be the point
of sending him to prison?

11:41.935 --> 11:44.888
Dr. Bull, this trial isn't
an ethics symposium.

11:44.890 --> 11:47.591
We can't just give someone
a â€œget out of jail freeâ€ card

11:47.593 --> 11:49.426
for evading the law.

11:49.428 --> 11:50.828
Come on, did you really think

11:50.830 --> 11:52.763
I was gonna roll over
for you that easily?

11:52.765 --> 11:54.231
He's an innocent man.

11:54.233 --> 11:55.532
Maybe he is...

11:56.101 --> 11:57.826
and maybe he isn't.

11:58.571 --> 12:00.870
That is why we're having a trial.

12:03.039 --> 12:04.575
See you on the ice, gentlemen.

12:06.045 --> 12:07.644
A man can't be found guilty

12:07.646 --> 12:10.614
of a murder simply because
it happened in his midst.

12:10.616 --> 12:13.317
And he absolutely can't be found guilty

12:13.319 --> 12:14.818
of a murder in which he took no part

12:14.820 --> 12:16.220
and was not even aware.

12:16.222 --> 12:17.747
So that's our narrative?

12:17.749 --> 12:19.022
We're gonna make the government prove

12:19.024 --> 12:20.958
that George knew what was going on?

12:20.960 --> 12:23.293
Yeah. To be held accountable
for a joint venture,

12:23.295 --> 12:25.028
George had to have known

12:25.030 --> 12:27.798
that his brother was gonna
commit armed robbery.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.266
And he didn't know.

12:29.268 --> 12:31.301
How in the world are we gonna prove that?

12:31.303 --> 12:34.137
We'll start by showing the jury
what kind of man he is.

12:34.139 --> 12:36.641
And the key to that is his wife.

12:36.643 --> 12:37.674
Chunk.

12:37.676 --> 12:39.142
Let's get her in here.

12:39.144 --> 12:41.879
What's important is when she
is sitting in that courtroom,

12:41.881 --> 12:44.681
that she sends the right message
to the jurors.

12:44.683 --> 12:46.316
She loves this man.

12:46.318 --> 12:48.685
She trusts this man.

12:49.085 --> 12:50.254
This is a good man.

12:50.256 --> 12:52.689
All right. I'll do whatever I can

12:52.691 --> 12:54.625
to get her in here today.

12:54.627 --> 12:56.960
And what do we know about how
and from whom

12:56.962 --> 12:59.162
he bought this fake
Social Security number?

12:59.164 --> 13:01.498
Well, he says he met a guy
at a bus station.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.833
Says his name was Joe,

13:02.835 --> 13:04.935
and he sold cell phones in Burlington,

13:04.937 --> 13:06.270
which makes sense,

13:06.272 --> 13:08.438
'cause to buy a cell phone,
you have to buy a plan;

13:08.440 --> 13:10.594
To buy a plan,
you have to give the merchant

13:10.596 --> 13:12.181
your Social Security number.

13:12.183 --> 13:13.891
Well, at least you did back then.

13:13.916 --> 13:15.715
Any thoughts on voir dire?

13:15.717 --> 13:17.751
The more I think about it,
the more I think

13:17.753 --> 13:21.254
the answer lies in... generativity.

13:21.256 --> 13:22.956
Okay, I'm out.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.524
Yeah, me, too.

13:24.526 --> 13:25.959
Seven years of college

13:25.961 --> 13:28.228
and I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:28.230 --> 13:31.264
Generativity is the concern for,

13:31.266 --> 13:33.533
and belief in, the future.

13:33.535 --> 13:35.435
And a commitment
to the idea that no matter

13:35.437 --> 13:39.139
how bad things may be
at any given moment,

13:39.141 --> 13:42.309
you can persevere and redeem yourself.

13:43.612 --> 13:45.545
Let me give you an example.

13:45.547 --> 13:46.913
Marissa.

13:47.769 --> 13:49.616
If you say so.

13:49.618 --> 13:51.117
I mean it as a compliment.

13:51.119 --> 13:53.520
It's an admirable quality in a person.

13:53.522 --> 13:56.323
So, tell me your life story.

13:56.325 --> 13:58.592
Boil it down to what
you think's relevant.

13:58.594 --> 14:02.896
I was adopted into a wonderful family.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.864
And meeting my birth parents

14:04.866 --> 14:06.499
made me appreciate different ways

14:06.501 --> 14:08.568
my life could have ended up.

14:09.437 --> 14:11.125
But I like the way it's gone.

14:11.873 --> 14:14.174
I worked for Homeland Security.

14:14.176 --> 14:17.177
I developed an algorithm to try
to help understand people,

14:17.179 --> 14:19.300
which led me to you.

14:20.349 --> 14:23.894
I have had a string
of interesting relationships.

14:23.896 --> 14:27.392
Some good, one Kyle.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.291
But none of them broke me,

14:31.293 --> 14:33.606
and none of them made me who I am.

14:36.365 --> 14:37.797
You see?

14:37.799 --> 14:39.599
Highly generative people,

14:39.601 --> 14:41.468
they're driven to help others

14:41.470 --> 14:42.869
for the betterment of the future,

14:42.871 --> 14:45.005
because they see the arcs of their lives

14:45.007 --> 14:47.307
as redemption stories.

14:47.309 --> 14:48.875
And that's what we want.

14:48.877 --> 14:52.212
Jurors, who no matter what
the prosecution presents,

14:52.214 --> 14:54.648
will only see a man who's changed,

14:54.650 --> 14:58.585
making a good life
out of a bad circumstance.

14:58.587 --> 15:00.153
So tell me,

15:00.155 --> 15:02.289
if you lost your job today,

15:02.291 --> 15:04.124
where would you be in five years?

15:04.126 --> 15:07.193
I guess I'd try to find a
similar position somewhere else.

15:07.195 --> 15:09.229
And if that didn't work, well,

15:09.231 --> 15:10.997
I'd just try and find another job.

15:10.999 --> 15:13.967
I'd like to think I'm
the captain of my own destiny.

15:16.271 --> 15:19.439
This juror is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

15:19.441 --> 15:21.541
This should be interesting.

15:21.543 --> 15:25.478
Harold King was essentially
homeless from the age of 13 on.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.315
Grew up on the streets,
hustling for food and money.

15:28.317 --> 15:30.550
Finally got a legitimate job working

15:30.552 --> 15:32.352
for a private sanitation company.

15:32.354 --> 15:34.454
Worked there for 22 years,

15:34.456 --> 15:36.523
till he was suddenly laid off
last Christmas.

15:36.525 --> 15:38.491
Six weeks later, his wife left him.

15:38.493 --> 15:40.360
It's a wonder he can get out of bed.

15:40.362 --> 15:42.529
Let me ask you a question, sir.

15:42.531 --> 15:44.898
Would you trade your life
for anyone else's?

15:46.301 --> 15:47.767
Not a chance in hell.

15:47.769 --> 15:51.471
Everything I've been through
has made me who I am today.

15:51.473 --> 15:53.907
I love that man.

15:56.778 --> 15:59.679
â€œMr. Palmer, you continue
to confuse the law

15:59.681 --> 16:01.481
â€œwith some kind of game show.

16:01.483 --> 16:03.450
â€œIt's not about winning and losing.

16:03.452 --> 16:05.518
It's about the search for what is right.â€

16:05.520 --> 16:08.488
A â€œD.â€ Damn it. A â€œDâ€?

16:12.163 --> 16:14.027
Hi. I'm Kristen.

16:14.029 --> 16:16.429
Jim's wife... George's wife.

16:16.431 --> 16:18.465
II just came straight
from the courthouse.

16:18.467 --> 16:21.668
Dr. Bull wanted me
to do some witness prep?

16:21.670 --> 16:24.471
Although, nobody's told me
I was going to be a witness.

16:24.473 --> 16:25.905
Hi.

16:25.907 --> 16:27.540
I'm Chunk Palmer. It's nice to meet you.

16:27.542 --> 16:29.809
And no, you won't be going on the stand.

16:29.811 --> 16:32.612
Not in the immediate future, at least.

16:32.614 --> 16:34.381
Then what's the point?

16:36.885 --> 16:39.753
We just want to make sure
that you're mindful,

16:39.755 --> 16:42.055
that even when you're
sitting in the gallery,

16:42.057 --> 16:44.824
that the jury is still watching you.

16:45.530 --> 16:47.727
No. I know.

16:47.729 --> 16:49.262
It's important.

16:49.264 --> 16:51.264
It's all important.

16:51.266 --> 16:52.966
I actually went

16:52.968 --> 16:55.289
to go see him last night in jail.

16:56.338 --> 16:58.471
Not a moment I ever imagined,

16:58.473 --> 17:01.408
but I needed to know
what was true and what wasn't,

17:01.410 --> 17:03.756
about everything he's ever told me.

17:04.679 --> 17:07.847
And he was honest
about everything that mattered.

17:09.117 --> 17:12.515
I mentioned our kids and he cried.

17:13.454 --> 17:14.988
Do you have kids?

17:14.990 --> 17:17.523
Yeah. One.

17:17.526 --> 17:20.627
They're just... your everything.

17:20.628 --> 17:23.396
And the shock of all of it,

17:23.397 --> 17:25.397
knowing that their last names...

17:25.400 --> 17:28.268
my last name... is made up, bought.

17:28.270 --> 17:30.326
I got so mad.

17:30.328 --> 17:34.574
And then he reminded me
that their first names...

17:34.576 --> 17:37.043
those were ours.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.680
Our first baby, Malone,

17:40.682 --> 17:43.650
before she arrived, we had no money.

17:43.652 --> 17:45.218
And so for fun, we would go

17:45.220 --> 17:46.786
to these minor league baseball games.

17:46.788 --> 17:49.756
And they cost, like,
two dollars a ticket.

17:49.758 --> 17:52.659
And they had this shortstop,
Malone Jackson.

17:52.661 --> 17:54.223
And Jimmy...

17:55.130 --> 17:57.163
George loved him.

17:57.165 --> 17:58.932
He loves everything about baseball,

17:58.934 --> 18:01.868
but he really loved him.

18:01.870 --> 18:03.983
And so I loved him, too.

18:05.106 --> 18:08.608
And when the baby came,
and she was a she,

18:08.610 --> 18:11.544
we said â€œso what,â€

18:11.546 --> 18:14.848
and she became Malone.

18:18.915 --> 18:20.453
That's her.

18:20.455 --> 18:22.388
That's Malone.

18:22.390 --> 18:24.962
And Ella and Richard.

18:25.927 --> 18:28.174
They're with my mom right now.

18:29.464 --> 18:32.098
They miss him so much.

18:33.975 --> 18:35.608
This...

18:35.871 --> 18:38.671
how you look and feel right now,

18:38.673 --> 18:40.306
that's what we need in the courtroom.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.309
So, when you're sitting there,

18:43.311 --> 18:45.011
and the prosecution is making him out

18:45.013 --> 18:47.447
to be anything but the man you know,

18:47.985 --> 18:50.112
remember this feeling.

18:50.785 --> 18:52.865
It's gonna give you peace.

18:53.455 --> 18:58.091
And it's gonna help the jury see
who George really is.

19:12.474 --> 19:14.641
Ladies and gentleman of the jury,

19:14.643 --> 19:18.778
I am here to tell you
about an innocent man,

19:18.780 --> 19:22.081
who endured difficult circumstances

19:22.083 --> 19:23.750
early in his life,

19:24.188 --> 19:26.482
only to make something of himself.

19:27.355 --> 19:31.324
My client was born George Brown,

19:31.326 --> 19:34.460
to parents Malone and Ella Brown.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.821
Both parents were killed
in a car accident

19:38.823 --> 19:41.100
when George was only ten.

19:41.102 --> 19:42.569
And his brother, Richard Brown,

19:42.571 --> 19:44.203
raised him for the next eight years.

19:44.205 --> 19:46.659
Your wife suddenly seems very upset.

19:46.684 --> 19:48.038
George Brown is a loving husband...

19:48.040 --> 19:49.958
- Marissa, is Chunk there?
- A devoted father...

19:49.960 --> 19:52.378
Did he even prepare Kristen at all?

19:52.380 --> 19:54.314
She looks like she's about to fall apart.

19:54.316 --> 19:55.915
I don't know what to say.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.750
I worked with the woman
for almost an hour.

19:57.752 --> 20:00.420
Here it is online. Malone and Ella Brown.

20:00.422 --> 20:03.890
â€œFatal collision kills parents
of two in Staten Islandâ€...

20:03.892 --> 20:05.258
Wait a second.

20:05.260 --> 20:08.027
Did you say Malone and Ella?

20:08.029 --> 20:10.630
Those are his parents' names?

20:10.632 --> 20:12.765
Those are the names of their kids.

20:12.767 --> 20:14.823
He lied to her again.

20:14.825 --> 20:17.537
The two boys didn't have
an easy time of it,

20:17.539 --> 20:21.341
but nonetheless, they had
to do what they had to do,

20:21.343 --> 20:22.742
- in order to get on...
- Face front.

20:22.744 --> 20:23.943
You're only making things worse.

20:23.945 --> 20:25.445
The older brother, Richard,

20:25.447 --> 20:28.014
took a job as a janitor
at the local mall,

20:28.016 --> 20:29.882
and George went about

20:29.884 --> 20:32.085
completing his high school education.

20:56.651 --> 20:57.935
You okay?

20:59.075 --> 21:01.113
My children are named after parents

21:01.115 --> 21:02.560
I never knew anything about,

21:02.562 --> 21:05.134
and a brotherinlaw I never met.

21:05.135 --> 21:06.835
Why would he do that?

21:06.837 --> 21:09.003
That's not a lie he needed to tell me,

21:09.005 --> 21:10.862
and how many more of those are there?

21:10.864 --> 21:13.714
Well, lies are funny things.

21:14.799 --> 21:17.445
I can tell you from personal experience,

21:17.447 --> 21:20.949
you convince yourself
there's only one lie

21:20.951 --> 21:22.984
you need to tell out of necessity.

21:24.487 --> 21:26.143
And then the others...

21:27.123 --> 21:30.725
the others just... happen.

21:30.727 --> 21:32.413
It's all too much.

21:32.415 --> 21:33.962
I know it seems that way,

21:33.964 --> 21:36.264
but he needs you.

21:36.266 --> 21:37.966
And tomorrow, the prosecution

21:37.968 --> 21:40.034
is gonna begin to present its case.

21:40.036 --> 21:42.604
And if you're not there, he has no one,

21:42.606 --> 21:44.806
and the jury's gonna notice.

21:45.204 --> 21:46.875
They certainly did when you left.

21:46.877 --> 21:48.276
So after executing

21:48.278 --> 21:50.211
the search warrant
on the suspect's premises,

21:50.213 --> 21:51.479
what did you find?

21:51.481 --> 21:53.681
We found a gun under a mattress

21:53.683 --> 21:55.850
in what we determined
to be Rick Brown's bedroom

21:55.852 --> 21:58.719
in the apartment that,
Rick and George Brown lived in.

21:58.721 --> 22:00.144
- Stop looking for her.
- Were you able

22:00.168 --> 22:01.122
to lift fingerprints...

22:01.124 --> 22:02.790
All you're doing is calling
the jury's attention

22:02.792 --> 22:05.059
- to the fact that she's not here.
- Yes. Two sets.

22:05.061 --> 22:06.561
Did you determine who they belonged to?

22:06.563 --> 22:09.030
Rick Brown and the defendant,
George Brown.

22:16.026 --> 22:18.539
You sent the gun to the crime lab.

22:18.541 --> 22:19.841
We certainly did.

22:19.843 --> 22:22.210
And you got my client's prints back.

22:22.212 --> 22:23.678
We certainly did.

22:36.793 --> 22:38.693
Tell Chunk mission accomplished.

22:38.695 --> 22:40.495
And thank you.

22:41.331 --> 22:44.999
Now, just to be clear,

22:45.001 --> 22:48.136
do these prints show you

22:48.138 --> 22:50.705
when George Brown touched the gun?

22:50.707 --> 22:52.140
No.

22:52.142 --> 22:54.909
And do they reveal
how he handled the gun?

22:54.911 --> 22:57.111
I mean, I would think there's one set

22:57.113 --> 23:00.348
of prints you typically get
when someone uses a gun

23:00.350 --> 23:02.550
and perhaps a different pattern of prints

23:02.552 --> 23:04.852
when someone handles the gun.

23:05.576 --> 23:08.022
Picks it up, to move it.

23:08.024 --> 23:08.990
Something like that.

23:08.992 --> 23:10.491
I suppose that's true.

23:10.493 --> 23:13.494
Well, it's either true
or it isn't, Detective.

23:13.496 --> 23:15.063
Yes.

23:15.065 --> 23:16.497
If someone used the gun,

23:16.499 --> 23:18.232
the location of the prints
would be different

23:18.234 --> 23:19.734
than if somebody handled the gun.

23:19.736 --> 23:21.832
And would you say

23:21.834 --> 23:24.939
that the pattern of his prints
is consistent

23:24.941 --> 23:27.608
with someone who had used the gun?

23:28.945 --> 23:30.311
No,

23:30.313 --> 23:31.446
I would not.

23:31.448 --> 23:32.580
And you've already testified

23:32.582 --> 23:35.149
that the prints don't indicate

23:35.151 --> 23:37.385
when my client
might have handled the gun.

23:37.387 --> 23:38.653
Isn't that correct?

23:38.655 --> 23:40.288
Your Honor, counsel's testifying.

23:40.290 --> 23:41.289
Overruled.

23:41.291 --> 23:42.790
Continue, Mr. ColÃ³n.

23:42.792 --> 23:43.758
Yes, Your Honor.

23:43.760 --> 23:46.627
So, to sum it up,

23:46.629 --> 23:49.330
you have my client's prints

23:49.332 --> 23:51.866
on a gun that belonged to a man

23:51.868 --> 23:55.903
that he had shared a home with
his entire life.

23:55.905 --> 23:57.672
Not a surprise.

23:57.674 --> 24:00.408
The prints don't prove he used the gun

24:00.410 --> 24:03.444
or that it was in his possession

24:03.446 --> 24:06.981
at any time in or around the robbery.

24:06.983 --> 24:11.085
Is that an accurate reflection
of your testimony, Detective?

24:11.921 --> 24:13.488
Yes.

24:13.490 --> 24:15.590
No further questions, Your Honor.

24:18.161 --> 24:19.427
How's the weather over there?

24:19.429 --> 24:20.862
We still frozen out?

24:20.864 --> 24:23.297
Actually, I'm starting
to feel a bit of a thaw.

24:23.299 --> 24:25.433
We picked up one green juror.

24:25.435 --> 24:27.602
I'll take it.

24:27.604 --> 24:29.303
And I just had a thought.

24:29.305 --> 24:31.039
See if you can get Benny and me

24:31.041 --> 24:33.508
two visitors' passes to Green Haven.

24:34.411 --> 24:37.745
We'd like to sit down with Rick Brown.

24:43.987 --> 24:47.088
Mr. Brown, my name's Dr. Jason Bull.

24:47.090 --> 24:49.857
This is Benjamin ColÃ³n.

24:49.859 --> 24:52.260
We're here on behalf of
your brother, George Brown.

24:52.766 --> 24:54.195
On behalf of your brother

24:54.197 --> 24:56.364
and his wife Kristen

24:56.366 --> 24:58.633
and their three children,

24:58.635 --> 25:01.135
your nieces and nephew.

25:02.472 --> 25:04.639
He's a dad? He's a...

25:04.641 --> 25:07.375
I'm an uncle?

25:12.082 --> 25:14.849
WhWhere is he? Is he okay?

25:14.851 --> 25:17.452
He's on trial
for the murder of Kirk Getty.

25:20.290 --> 25:23.391
My God.

25:23.393 --> 25:25.626
We're trying to help your brother.

25:25.628 --> 25:26.928
Mr. ColÃ³n is his attorney,

25:26.930 --> 25:30.131
and I'm what they call a trial scientist.

25:30.133 --> 25:32.733
Now, obviously, we know George's version

25:32.735 --> 25:35.993
of what happened that night.
But only you know

25:35.995 --> 25:38.840
what went on inside
the check cashing shop.

25:38.842 --> 25:41.409
What do you want to know?

25:41.411 --> 25:43.744
I waswas all bundled up.

25:43.746 --> 25:45.713
Big coat.

25:45.715 --> 25:47.014
Scarves.

25:47.016 --> 25:49.217
Ski gloves.

25:50.019 --> 25:51.742
It was cold.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.822
Plus...

25:54.824 --> 25:56.724
I knew there was a camera.

25:56.726 --> 25:58.226
And you were armed?

25:58.228 --> 26:00.162
I had a gun.

26:00.164 --> 26:01.896
And it wasn't loaded.

26:03.266 --> 26:05.199
Plus, II was wearing gloves.

26:05.201 --> 26:07.969
You ever try to hold a gun

26:07.971 --> 26:09.036
while you're wearing ski gloves?

26:09.038 --> 26:10.371
Wait a second.

26:10.373 --> 26:12.607
Go back to the part
where the gun wasn't loaded.

26:12.609 --> 26:15.076
What about it?
There was no reason to load it.

26:15.078 --> 26:17.211
I wasn't planning on shooting it.

26:17.213 --> 26:18.546
And why was that?

26:19.019 --> 26:21.249
Because I wasn't planning
on killing Kirk.

26:21.251 --> 26:23.117
He was my friend.

26:24.554 --> 26:27.255
Well, if you didn't plan on using the gun

26:27.257 --> 26:29.323
and Kirk was your friend,

26:29.325 --> 26:31.726
- what was your plan?
- I was planning

26:31.728 --> 26:32.727
on paying some bills.

26:32.729 --> 26:35.329
I was planning on being a good brother.

26:35.331 --> 26:37.899
George started talking
about wanting to go

26:37.901 --> 26:40.635
to cooking school after he graduated.

26:42.639 --> 26:44.238
And I met this guy at the mall.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.574
He worked at the Sunglass Hut.

26:46.576 --> 26:50.411
He ended up getting a job
at the check cashing place.

26:50.413 --> 26:53.447
And he wanted to buy
a motorcycle, this guy.

26:55.652 --> 26:58.786
We thought we were so freakin' brilliant.

26:58.788 --> 27:00.054
Wait a second. I'm...

27:00.056 --> 27:01.289
I'm confused.

27:01.291 --> 27:04.091
So, your friend, how did he die?

27:04.565 --> 27:06.327
We knew that they had cameras.

27:06.329 --> 27:08.796
We knew we had to put on a show.

27:09.153 --> 27:11.332
I came in there, waved the gun around,

27:11.334 --> 27:14.936
I tied him up, put a gag in his mouth.

27:14.938 --> 27:17.202
And then I don't know what happened.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.474
By the time I was done,

27:20.476 --> 27:23.511
you know, they to... they told me
they think he panicked.

27:23.513 --> 27:27.815
He threw up, choked on his own vomit.

27:30.153 --> 27:32.486
Tell me about George.

27:32.488 --> 27:34.255
You tell me about George.

27:34.257 --> 27:36.757
Did he have any idea what was going on?

27:36.759 --> 27:38.226
Not a clue. He was just...

27:38.228 --> 27:39.727
He was my ride. That's all.

27:39.729 --> 27:41.310
Period.

27:41.998 --> 27:43.698
You want to make this right?

27:44.396 --> 27:46.234
What do you mean? How?

27:46.236 --> 27:48.002
Testify on his behalf.

27:48.004 --> 27:49.337
I'd love to.

27:49.339 --> 27:51.138
But who's gonna believe me?

27:52.141 --> 27:53.541
You let us worry about that.

27:56.145 --> 27:58.346
- Your brother said to say hello.
- Rick?

27:59.244 --> 28:01.382
HHow is he? Is he okay?

28:01.384 --> 28:03.818
As okay as you can be in prison.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.286
He feels terrible

28:05.288 --> 28:07.021
about everything that's happening to you.

28:07.023 --> 28:08.789
He wants to help.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.666
So...

28:12.128 --> 28:14.228
the court officer just informed me

28:14.230 --> 28:16.998
that the judge wants to have
a meeting in his chambers.

28:17.934 --> 28:19.267
Yes,

28:19.269 --> 28:21.302
I am asking to call a surprise witness.

28:21.304 --> 28:23.404
But it's as much a surprise to
me as it is to you, Your Honor.

28:23.406 --> 28:25.606
We just put this piece of
the puzzle together yesterday.

28:25.608 --> 28:27.908
Your Honor, what
may or may not have happened

28:27.910 --> 28:30.945
three years after the crime
that my client is on trial for

28:30.947 --> 28:32.480
is completely irrelevant.

28:32.482 --> 28:34.882
I disagree. It is the
very definition of relevance.

28:34.884 --> 28:36.284
It's a subsequent bad act.

28:36.286 --> 28:39.186
Your client used his stolen
identity to commit larceny

28:39.188 --> 28:40.855
in the state of New Hampshire.

28:40.857 --> 28:43.858
He bought $10,000 worth of
electronics at a Best Buy

28:43.860 --> 28:45.526
with a fraudulently acquired credit card

28:45.528 --> 28:46.627
and never paid it off.

28:46.629 --> 28:48.896
Well, maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

28:48.898 --> 28:51.198
Let's not forget none of this
has been proven. But,

28:51.200 --> 28:53.768
as Mr. ColÃ³n pointed out,
how would credit card theft

28:53.770 --> 28:55.936
illuminate for the jury
whether or not Mr. Brown

28:55.938 --> 28:57.338
was party to a murder?

28:57.340 --> 28:59.607
Well, for one, it might very well suggest

28:59.609 --> 29:02.810
a pattern of lawlessness that
the jury could find compelling

29:02.812 --> 29:05.046
as they try to wrestle
with the key question here,

29:05.048 --> 29:07.882
which is, how much did
Mr. Brown actually know

29:07.884 --> 29:09.450
about what he was doing that night?

29:09.452 --> 29:11.919
Really, Your Honor?
The possibility that my client

29:11.921 --> 29:14.989
may have bought a TV and
DVD player and never paid for it

29:14.991 --> 29:17.958
somehow makes him
a more plausible coconspirator

29:17.960 --> 29:19.126
to murder?

29:19.128 --> 29:20.528
Are you lecturing me, sir?

29:20.530 --> 29:22.530
Of course not, Your Honor.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.133
I'm going to allow the witness.

29:26.135 --> 29:28.135
But I'm calling

29:28.137 --> 29:30.906
a recess for today to allow
both sides to prepare.

29:30.908 --> 29:32.873
Thank you for allowing the witness.

29:32.875 --> 29:34.742
- And thank you for the time to prepare.
- Yes.

29:34.744 --> 29:37.611
Thank you for the time to prepare.

29:37.613 --> 29:39.947
You're all very welcome.

29:49.740 --> 29:52.541
Even if we do put
his brother on the stand,

29:52.566 --> 29:54.199
he's right. Who's gonna believe him?

29:54.201 --> 29:56.000
It's a tough story to buy into.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.247
â€œMy friend and I planned

29:57.249 --> 29:58.427
â€œthis robbery together.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.004
â€œHe just happened to die. And,

30:00.006 --> 30:02.407
â€œby the way, my brother had no idea

30:02.409 --> 30:04.976
- what we were up toâ€?
- Not to pour salt in the wound,

30:04.978 --> 30:07.879
but the two green jurors that
we still have, they're soft.

30:07.881 --> 30:10.381
Based on my focus group work,

30:10.383 --> 30:12.120
it's not gonna take
much to turn them red.

30:13.553 --> 30:14.819
I don't want to hear it!

30:14.821 --> 30:16.643
I've had enough bad news for one day.

30:16.645 --> 30:18.425
Too damn bad. I'm coming in.

30:19.626 --> 30:22.193
Wow, look at all the happy faces.

30:23.964 --> 30:25.897
You come up with something
to refute the charges

30:25.899 --> 30:27.499
that George committed credit card fraud?

30:27.501 --> 30:28.867
Although, for the life of me,

30:28.869 --> 30:31.202
I still don't see
what that has to do with this.

30:31.204 --> 30:32.637
Cable's working on it.

30:32.639 --> 30:34.539
I've been watching the
closed circuit security tapes

30:34.541 --> 30:37.208
of the robbery that came
over with the prosecution's

30:37.210 --> 30:39.511
latest batch of discovery materials.

30:39.513 --> 30:41.513
Can I show you guys something?

30:41.515 --> 30:43.181
There's no sound.

30:43.183 --> 30:45.494
Just picture.
So you got to watch carefully.

30:47.020 --> 30:50.188
Okay, see what George's brother
does after everything is done?

30:50.190 --> 30:51.589
He's got the money.

30:51.591 --> 30:53.473
Now, based on the time stamp,
we know that,

30:53.475 --> 30:54.915
by this time, the alarm is going off.

30:54.917 --> 30:57.328
So he's got to be concerned
that the cops are on their way.

30:57.330 --> 30:58.630
Watch him.

30:58.632 --> 31:02.233
He starts to head out,
and then he comes back.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.983
Looks like he's saying something.

31:03.985 --> 31:06.431
He's realizing something's wrong.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.741
See?

31:09.743 --> 31:11.075
He's realizing

31:11.077 --> 31:12.810
his friend is dead.

31:12.812 --> 31:14.946
When's the last time
you heard about a robber

31:14.948 --> 31:17.348
stopping midgetaway
to check his victim's pulse?

31:17.350 --> 31:19.817
So you think if we show this to a jury

31:19.819 --> 31:21.686
after we put Rick on the stand,
they'll believe

31:21.688 --> 31:23.888
that Kirk's death was accidental?

31:23.890 --> 31:25.290
Yes!

31:26.126 --> 31:28.241
I think George has an alibi.

31:28.243 --> 31:30.261
Well, what do you mean?

31:30.263 --> 31:31.930
Okay, on the day of the purchase,

31:31.932 --> 31:33.002
he was nowhere near New Hampshire.

31:33.004 --> 31:36.050
He was working as a dishwasher
in a restaurant he now owns.

31:36.052 --> 31:38.349
I just finished reaching out
to his old boss, the man

31:38.351 --> 31:39.804
he bought the restaurant from.

31:39.806 --> 31:41.573
He has time cards and eyewitnesses.

31:41.575 --> 31:43.775
There is no way he could have done it.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.299
What do you think?

31:45.301 --> 31:46.638
It's good.

31:47.214 --> 31:50.215
I just wish it was a little more.

31:50.217 --> 31:52.884
And I wish with all my heart
it proved he had no idea

31:52.886 --> 31:54.726
what his brother and best friend
were up to that night.

31:54.728 --> 31:57.827
Well, actually,
there is a little bit more.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.460
I tracked down the Best Buy receipts

31:59.462 --> 32:01.429
and located all the serial
numbers and identifiers

32:01.431 --> 32:02.964
associated with the purchased items,

32:02.966 --> 32:04.899
which were actually laptops, by the way.

32:04.901 --> 32:07.035
Then I did a search for those.

32:07.037 --> 32:08.670
And after all this time,
I actually found one

32:08.672 --> 32:09.704
on an archived

32:09.706 --> 32:11.239
online auction site.

32:11.241 --> 32:12.874
I did a little hacking

32:12.876 --> 32:15.910
and tracked down the seller's IP address.

32:15.912 --> 32:16.945
And it turns out

32:16.947 --> 32:20.114
it belongs to an Emory Cochburn,

32:20.116 --> 32:24.018
who, by the way, is in prison
for insurance fraud.

32:24.020 --> 32:26.254
- Which means...?
- Which means

32:26.256 --> 32:29.390
whoever sold the stolen
Social Security number to George

32:29.392 --> 32:31.357
sold it at least one more time.

32:31.359 --> 32:33.127
Looks that way.

32:33.129 --> 32:34.429
Nice work, Cable.

32:34.431 --> 32:36.130
I just wish

32:36.132 --> 32:37.398
it cleared George of the crime

32:37.400 --> 32:39.634
we were hired to defend him from.

32:39.636 --> 32:41.502
George Brown stole
the Social Security number

32:41.504 --> 32:42.904
of the deceased, Jim Grayson,

32:42.906 --> 32:44.739
to establish a new identity.

32:44.741 --> 32:46.407
He then opened a credit card

32:46.409 --> 32:48.476
at a Best Buy
in Manchester, New Hampshire,

32:48.478 --> 32:51.813
and used that card to purchase
$10,000 worth of electronics

32:51.815 --> 32:53.615
that he had no intention
of ever paying for.

32:54.498 --> 32:56.818
Thank you, Officer Lyden.

33:01.725 --> 33:03.725
Officer Lyden, thank you.

33:03.727 --> 33:05.560
Thank you for taking the time and coming

33:05.562 --> 33:07.462
- to talk to us today.
- My pleasure.

33:07.464 --> 33:08.930
Let me ask you something.

33:08.932 --> 33:11.766
Do you have any actual proof

33:11.768 --> 33:17.272
that the man sitting before you
here today is the same man

33:17.274 --> 33:19.374
who fraudulently applied
for a credit card

33:19.376 --> 33:21.075
and bought these electronics?

33:21.077 --> 33:25.446
Of course. It's the same name,
same Social Security number.

33:25.448 --> 33:27.115
What else do you need?

33:27.117 --> 33:29.183
And what if I told you
that this Jim Grayson,

33:29.185 --> 33:32.954
also known as George Brown,
was in Glen Rock, New Jersey,

33:32.956 --> 33:35.123
hundreds of miles away
at the time of the purchase,

33:35.125 --> 33:36.791
and that someone else had bought

33:36.793 --> 33:39.394
the same stolen Social Security number

33:39.396 --> 33:42.130
and committed the theft that you
are attributing to my client?

33:42.132 --> 33:45.033
Well, I would say that sounds
like a pretty convenient story.

33:47.971 --> 33:51.372
Your Honor, we'd like to offer proof

33:51.374 --> 33:53.675
of my client's alibi

33:53.677 --> 33:56.744
in the form of time cards

33:56.746 --> 33:58.980
and eyewitness accounts

33:58.982 --> 34:01.249
from Mr. Brown's place of employment

34:01.251 --> 34:02.817
at the date in question.

34:02.819 --> 34:06.120
It may not be the
slam dunk we need... not yet...

34:06.122 --> 34:07.889
but these jurors are starting to warm up.

34:07.891 --> 34:09.223
I can feel it.

34:09.225 --> 34:10.925
The jury hasn't heard enough to acquit,

34:10.927 --> 34:12.159
or even force a mistrial,

34:12.161 --> 34:13.828
but they're listening to us again.

34:13.830 --> 34:15.563
They think we have something to say,

34:15.565 --> 34:17.264
and I'll take that any time.

34:17.266 --> 34:21.710
Tell Cable thanks for all the hard work.

34:30.215 --> 34:31.614
I just kept thinking
about what you told us

34:31.616 --> 34:32.782
the older brother said.

34:32.784 --> 34:34.967
That this whole thing
was really an inside job.

34:34.969 --> 34:37.405
That no one was supposed
to lose their lives.

34:37.429 --> 34:38.862
That these guys knew each other.

34:38.864 --> 34:41.264
And then I kept thinking
about what you said.

34:41.266 --> 34:44.368
That Rick can testify to it,
but who's gonna believe him?

34:44.370 --> 34:45.502
How do you prove it?

34:45.504 --> 34:47.071
Yeah? So?

34:47.072 --> 34:49.606
So I woke up and watched the tape again.

34:49.608 --> 34:52.141
I mean, the idea of it
actually woke me up.

34:52.949 --> 34:56.746
Only this time, I watched
it with that in mind.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.683
And I think I found something.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.387
See that?

35:03.389 --> 35:04.961
See what?

35:05.858 --> 35:08.859
Kirk, the friend, he puts his hands up

35:08.861 --> 35:11.462
before Rick pulls out his gun.

35:13.499 --> 35:16.600
You want proof it was an
inside job, there it is.

35:17.224 --> 35:19.336
You want to prove that
they knew each other,

35:19.338 --> 35:21.105
there it is.

35:21.107 --> 35:23.874
You want to prove that no one
was supposed to die that night?

35:23.876 --> 35:25.676
Picture's worth a thousand words.

35:25.678 --> 35:28.312
If we can prove it's an inside
job with the cooperation

35:28.314 --> 35:29.746
of an employee of the store,

35:29.748 --> 35:31.148
technically, there's no armed robbery,

35:31.150 --> 35:34.284
which negates the felony murder
charge, which means...

35:34.286 --> 35:36.787
George is actually innocent.

35:42.795 --> 35:44.661
Well, what'd you get?

35:44.663 --> 35:46.630
The mother lode, pretty much.

35:46.632 --> 35:48.196
Although I think I did promise

35:48.198 --> 35:50.153
- to marry the guy who got them for me.
- Excellent.

35:50.155 --> 35:51.602
Who doesn't love a good wedding?

35:51.604 --> 35:52.903
So you're looking at call logs

35:52.905 --> 35:54.404
between Kirk's pager and Rick's phone,

35:54.406 --> 35:56.406
Rick's pager and Kirk's phone,

35:56.408 --> 35:59.076
and calls between both men's
phones starting in late 1999.

35:59.078 --> 36:02.212
Then it jumps to ten exchanges per day

36:02.214 --> 36:04.813
during the week of the robbery.

36:05.484 --> 36:07.217
Great.

36:07.219 --> 36:09.520
Um, go home, get some sleep.

36:10.709 --> 36:12.933
What is your relationship
to the defendant?

36:14.364 --> 36:16.725
He's my younger brother.

36:16.727 --> 36:18.529
And what was your relationship

36:18.531 --> 36:20.430
to the clerk who died in the robbery...

36:20.432 --> 36:22.032
Kirk Getty?

36:22.034 --> 36:26.470
I worked in the mall as a custodian.

36:26.472 --> 36:28.338
Kirk sold sunglasses.

36:28.340 --> 36:30.140
We met one night.

36:30.142 --> 36:32.172
We hit it off.

36:32.174 --> 36:34.778
We realized, we had a lot in common.

36:34.780 --> 36:36.246
So,

36:36.248 --> 36:38.916
I mean, at what point
did the two of you decide

36:38.918 --> 36:40.609
to stage a robbery together?

36:40.611 --> 36:42.243
Objection. Leading.

36:43.739 --> 36:44.988
My apologies, Your Honor.

36:44.990 --> 36:46.690
Let me word it a different way.

36:46.692 --> 36:50.227
Whose idea was it

36:50.229 --> 36:52.696
to rob a check cashing place?

36:52.698 --> 36:56.700
Well, it actually started out
with Kirk. He...

36:56.702 --> 36:59.136
You know, he wanted
to buy this motorcycle.

36:59.138 --> 37:02.839
But truthfully, within 90 seconds,

37:02.841 --> 37:04.241
we were planning it together.

37:04.243 --> 37:07.745
Because he worked there,
he knew all the important stuff,

37:07.747 --> 37:10.013
like combination to the safe

37:10.015 --> 37:12.282
and what day and time to show up

37:12.284 --> 37:14.716
when there would be the most cash there.

37:15.521 --> 37:18.411
It really seemed like
it was gonna be easy.

37:18.413 --> 37:20.357
Andand what about
your brother, George Brown?

37:20.359 --> 37:21.592
Was he in on the planning?

37:21.594 --> 37:25.162
No. George would never do
something like that.

37:25.164 --> 37:28.065
All he was doing that night
was picking me up from work.

37:29.105 --> 37:30.801
He didn't know why I wanted

37:30.803 --> 37:32.936
to stop by the check cashing place.

37:32.938 --> 37:35.105
All he wanted was to get home.

37:35.107 --> 37:37.040
So you never planned on killing anyone?

37:37.042 --> 37:39.813
Of course not. There were
no bullets in the gun.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.746
It was all for the security camera.

37:42.748 --> 37:46.183
With that in mind,
we'd like to enter into evidence

37:46.185 --> 37:48.952
the security camera
footage from that night,

37:48.954 --> 37:51.989
with a particular emphasis
on the time code numbers

37:51.991 --> 37:55.125
indicated on the paperwork.

37:56.216 --> 37:59.446
You can clearly see the victim
with his hands up,

37:59.448 --> 38:02.733
even before the witness
exposes his weapon.

38:02.735 --> 38:04.501
A clear indication that he knew exactly

38:04.503 --> 38:06.470
what was going to happen that night.

38:07.573 --> 38:09.506
As well as another time code,

38:09.508 --> 38:11.975
which clearly shows
the witness delaying his exit

38:11.977 --> 38:13.510
out of the store,

38:13.512 --> 38:16.046
so he could check
on the condition of his friend

38:16.048 --> 38:19.783
once he realized that he was
in some form of distress.

38:19.785 --> 38:24.450
Additionally, we'd like to enter
into evidence phone records

38:24.452 --> 38:28.225
that clearly indicate
the prior relationship

38:28.227 --> 38:30.260
between the witness and the victim.

38:32.665 --> 38:34.264
Order in the court, please.

38:34.266 --> 38:38.368
Let's quiet down. Let's quiet down.

38:38.370 --> 38:40.837
No further questions
for this witness, Your Honor.

38:42.846 --> 38:45.509
Marissa, we just hit them with
all the firepower we've got.

38:45.511 --> 38:46.843
Tell me it made a difference.

38:46.845 --> 38:49.346
You want the good news or the bad news?

38:49.348 --> 38:51.081
All your generative jurors
finally woke up

38:51.083 --> 38:52.549
and have gone green.

38:52.551 --> 38:54.918
Bad news is, there's only six of them.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.587
The other six aren't quite there yet.

38:57.589 --> 38:59.690
Mr. Peluso, your witness.

38:59.692 --> 39:03.694
In light of all this new information,

39:03.696 --> 39:05.996
if it pleases the Court, I was hoping

39:05.998 --> 39:07.898
I could request a brief recess?

39:07.900 --> 39:11.368
This court will take a 20minute recess.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.137
What do you think that means?

39:14.139 --> 39:16.373
I don't know. Maybe he's a smoker.

39:16.375 --> 39:17.908
Maybe he's got a small bladder.

39:21.551 --> 39:23.361
Maybe he wants to borrow some money.

39:23.363 --> 39:24.748
I'll be right back.

39:28.850 --> 39:30.587
It's a great system, isn't it?

39:31.311 --> 39:34.491
You go into it thinking,
â€œI know what's going on here.

39:34.493 --> 39:36.215
â€œI know what's right.

39:36.897 --> 39:38.195
I know where this is gonna end upâ€...

39:38.197 --> 39:39.763
And then...

39:39.765 --> 39:41.965
It's just a great system.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.435
I think it's, like,
sevenfive, or fiveseven.

39:45.437 --> 39:47.070
Or maybe it's split down the middle.

39:47.072 --> 39:49.740
- What do you think?
- I think he's an innocent man.

39:49.742 --> 39:53.243
I think you know it.
I think they feel it.

39:53.245 --> 39:55.946
Thing is, you're not gonna get
'em all, and neither am I,

39:55.948 --> 39:57.581
which means you're staring at a mistrial,

39:57.583 --> 40:00.375
which means you steal another year

40:00.377 --> 40:02.586
of this guy's life while he sits in jail

40:02.588 --> 40:04.287
waiting for his second day in court.

40:04.289 --> 40:06.757
And his kids keep growing,
and his wife keeps wondering

40:06.759 --> 40:08.658
why she suddenly became a single parent.

40:08.660 --> 40:11.094
And he's forced to close his business

40:11.096 --> 40:12.596
and let his employees go.

40:12.598 --> 40:16.064
And like I said when we
first met, what's the point?

40:17.202 --> 40:18.702
He's not a criminal.

40:18.704 --> 40:20.337
He never was.

40:20.339 --> 40:23.607
You really want me to go in
there and ask for a dismissal?

40:24.155 --> 40:25.675
I have people I have to answer to.

40:25.677 --> 40:27.811
This is not an easy conversation to have.

40:27.813 --> 40:30.013
Yeah, but the conversation
you want to have

40:30.015 --> 40:33.583
isn't happening today, so why
not get this one over with?

40:33.585 --> 40:36.453
In fact, why don't you
call 'em right now?

40:37.168 --> 40:39.589
Mr. Assistant District Attorney,
you're not a stupid man.

40:39.591 --> 40:42.192
You know you're not getting a
conviction against George Brown.

40:42.194 --> 40:43.960
Not today, not ever.

40:43.962 --> 40:46.797
And that's with me and my team
having about a week to prepare.

40:46.799 --> 40:50.901
You put my client through
another year of this hell,

40:50.903 --> 40:54.471
and I promise you I will
spend every day of that year

40:54.473 --> 40:56.773
getting ready for the new trial.

40:57.438 --> 41:00.410
And when we meet again,
you won't know what hit you.

41:01.359 --> 41:05.048
Now I'm gonna go back inside
while you make up your mind.

41:05.822 --> 41:07.284
Surprise me.

41:16.669 --> 41:17.946
Your Honor?

41:18.788 --> 41:21.431
It's a great system, isn't it?

41:22.667 --> 41:25.735
You go into a trial thinking,
â€œI know what's going on here.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.993
â€œI know what's right.

41:27.039 --> 41:29.139
I know where this is gonna end up.â€

41:29.141 --> 41:31.007
And then the system humbles you.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.677
You realize you hadn't
considered all the facts,

41:33.679 --> 41:36.046
that your thinking may have been flawed.

41:36.048 --> 41:39.850
And that incarcerating someone
who almost certainly had no idea

41:39.852 --> 41:42.319
what was going on
in a building 35 feet away

41:42.321 --> 41:44.554
while he sat in a car makes no sense.

41:44.556 --> 41:46.790
I believe that's the case here.

41:46.792 --> 41:49.025
And with that in mind,
the district attorney's office

41:49.027 --> 41:50.694
would like to enter a motion

41:50.696 --> 41:53.296
to dismiss all charges
against George Brown.

41:54.700 --> 41:57.033
This court will accept
the prosecution's motion.

41:57.035 --> 41:58.468
The defendant is free to go.

41:58.470 --> 42:00.904
And we thank the jury for its service.

42:06.411 --> 42:08.645
Thank you.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.656
I know we've never met before.

42:21.527 --> 42:24.528
But my name is George.

42:24.530 --> 42:26.696
My last name is Brown.

42:28.667 --> 42:31.268
And you'd make me
the happiest man in the world

42:31.270 --> 42:34.938
if you'd marry me and make that
your last name, too.

42:44.683 --> 42:48.383
You know, I think those two
have a future together.

42:49.634 --> 42:51.121
Wait a second.

42:51.552 --> 42:54.391
Are those tears? You
crying, you big old softie?

42:54.393 --> 42:56.493
Excuse me. I believe you're mistaken.

42:56.495 --> 42:58.695
These are not tears.

42:58.697 --> 43:00.730
Wasn't it Tom Hanks who famously said,

43:00.732 --> 43:03.533
There's no tears in trial science?

43:03.535 --> 43:05.869
No. I believe he was talking
about chocolates.

43:05.871 --> 43:08.805
- No reference to trial science.
- Whatever.
