of my life.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.847
Now, why exactly would I stoop
to selling street drugs?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.549
Because it's lucrative.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.518
Because you have
the morals of a sea slug.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.434
It's not a bad theory.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.736
Except I'm
absolutely innocent.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.728
And there's not many things
I can say that about.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.315
You know, I was really hoping
we could get a fresh start,

14:28.702 --> 14:32.194
given that we'll probably
be seeing a lot more
of each other these days.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.620
And you base that
on what?

14:34.958 --> 14:37.870
Oh how close a bond
we both have now with,

14:38.795 --> 14:41.332
you know, with Alec.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.173
You have something
to say to me,
now would be the time.

14:50.974 --> 14:55.058
Alec and l are
in the process of forging
a business alliance.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.976
I'm surprised
he didn't mention it.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.353
You did this
to get back at me.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.480
Now, that's
a touch egocentric.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.942
The kid is a venture
capitalist's dream.

15:04.029 --> 15:07.396
It's like finding
Steve Wozniak at 18.

15:07.491 --> 15:10.324
You have no right
to drag Alec
into your world.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.492
You've got it backwards,
my darling.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.570
He dragged us
into his, remember?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.870
At the age of 80!

15:15.957 --> 15:17.743
He is now 18 years old.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.620
Old enough to decide
for himself.

15:19.711 --> 15:23.545
Alec has a destiny
to fulfill, and you're
intervening. Why?

15:24.466 --> 15:25.421
Because you feel like it.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.750
Kiera, relax.
I don't want
to change history, okay?

15:27.844 --> 15:29.584
| just...
I just want a ringside seat.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.513
SADLER: Kiera, are you there?

15:33.600 --> 15:34.715
I'm kind of busy right now.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.301
You know, this isn't a great
time for me, either.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.432
There's this neighborhood
watch social network,

15:39.523 --> 15:41.855
it's lighting up
over a multiple shooting
at the airport.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.022
I don't think it's
on the cops' radar yet.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.099
KIERA: Good work, Alec.

15:44.236 --> 15:46.227
Send me the coordinates
and I'll loop in Carlos.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.819
He is something,
isn't he?

15:50.659 --> 15:53.196
You screw with
that kid's life,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.402
and you will
answer to me.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.203
That is a promise.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.244
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
(SIREN WAILS)

16:22.190 --> 16:23.805
These are all
Coalition Kings.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.436
You think it's
gang-on-gang?

16:25.527 --> 16:28.143
Well, if it isn't,
someone sure wanted it
to look that way.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.354
Looks like they never
saw it coming.

16:30.907 --> 16:34.024
SO, on top of civil unrest
and a drug epidemic,

16:34.119 --> 16:36.826
you're telling me I've got
a gang war on my hands?

16:37.414 --> 16:40.872
I'm not sure we know enough
to call it a gang war
just yet.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.038
You must have
a working theory.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.791
CARLOS: Well, the Kings
have been trading hits
with the Syndicate

16:47.883 --> 16:49.623
for the last 14 months.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.208
Wolford's out on bail.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.090
Maybe he's trying
to get payback for
whoever set him up.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.429
Whatever these guys did,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.177
someone's trying
to eradicate them for it.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.807
DILLON: This city's
teetering on the brink.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.768
This mightjust be enough
to push it over the edge.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.226
Maybe that's what
Liber8's counting on.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.563
Only one of these guys
got a shot Off.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.489
(CHUCKLES)
These guys weren't
out on a Sunday stroll,

17:15.577 --> 17:17.033
these are hardcore killers.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.827
Were. Hunters became
the hunted.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.121
Look at the positions.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.540
They were planning
to surprise whoever
their target was.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.367
You mean targets, right?

17:25.462 --> 17:27.043
There must have been
multiple shooters

17:27.130 --> 17:28.370
to take this many guys down.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.706
Actually, they were all shot
by a single shooter

17:30.800 --> 17:34.964
standing or crouching
somewhere around here.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.091
You seem pretty sure
about that.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.719
Happened fast.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.350
Single gunman.

17:42.979 --> 17:43.968
That's impossible.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.431
NO one could retarget
that fast at this range.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.187
Unless it was a bad-ass
super soldier?

17:51.488 --> 17:53.524
Didn't we just let
one of those slip away?

17:53.615 --> 17:54.730
Travis Verta.

17:55.492 --> 17:59.610
SO Sonya is with the Kings
and they're at war
with Travis...

18:00.997 --> 18:01.986
You don't suppose that...

18:02.082 --> 18:03.242
Trouble in paradise.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.073
The enemy of my enemy
and all that.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.454
If it's true,
we should be able to
use this to our advantage.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.752
We should also expect
a lot more killing.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.623
If Sonya is trying
to take down Travis,

18:12.717 --> 18:14.799
next time she'll be coming
with a platoon.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.687
Have a drink, Lucas.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.390
You need to take
the edge Off.

18:33.697 --> 18:34.857
What's the problem?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.272
I don't even know
where to start.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.356
Try.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.571
Ifeeler
you're not taking this
Travis situation seriously.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.825
Really?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.365
I crawled into bed
with gangsters.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.039
And you're not
comfortable with that?

18:50.130 --> 18:52.416
It runs counter
to everything I believe

18:52.507 --> 18:54.919
and the message that Liber8
needs to seed in this time.

18:55.010 --> 18:58.002
They may be the only
thing between us and Travis.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.462
You need an army,
and the Coalition Kings

19:00.557 --> 19:02.843
are supposed to provide that
in return for the drugs.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.059
I was hoping to find
a non-violent path
to achieve our goals.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.804
We can get what we want
if we ask politely?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.729
That's how we got
our asses kicked.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.937
Ideas are more powerful
than guns.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.902
They're the only way
to prevail against
a stronger enemy.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.604
That's the message
Kagame left.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.154
Yeah.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.733
Right before he blew up
a building full of people.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.570
The next time you go up
against Travis,

19:25.081 --> 19:27.367
you tell me what
you'd rather be packing,

19:27.584 --> 19:30.246
a great idea, or this.

19:48.063 --> 19:51.226
Jason's a little skittish,
so thanks for the help.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.682
Maybe...
Uh, yeah, no problem.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.438
See you later?
Yeah.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.238
Is that him?
Is that him?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.696
Yeah. But that's
not why I'm here.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.247
Carlos said you
came to see me?

20:09.334 --> 20:10.323
Oh, yeah...

20:11.294 --> 20:13.876
I wasn't even sure
ifyou were gonna
get that message.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.875
Yeah, lthink it lost
a little something
in the translation.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.548
He said something
about freelancers?

20:20.136 --> 20:21.592
Yeah, I didn't want
to alarm you,

20:21.679 --> 20:24.056
but I wanted to let you
know that they're here,

20:24.140 --> 20:25.516
and they're after me.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.262
And, oh, ifyou find a body
turned all inside out,

20:28.353 --> 20:29.559
with the intestines hanging
from the trees,

20:29.646 --> 20:31.511
don't worry about the DNA,
it'll be mine.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.723
Okay, who are they, Jason,
these freelancers?

20:36.319 --> 20:38.150
Itinerant time travelers.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.730
Prospectors,
adventurers,
fugitives...

20:41.825 --> 20:42.860
They come
in all colors.

20:42.951 --> 20:45.988
Some say that they're here
to protect the timeline
from abuse,

20:46.079 --> 20:47.740
some say they
are the abusers.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.117
Okay, well, how long
have they been here?

20:50.250 --> 20:53.583
Oh. Who do you think
the telescope came from?

20:53.670 --> 20:55.501
I always assumed Galileo.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.340
Atomic bomb. Cold fusion.
Cherry Garcia ice cream.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.380
Whenever there's a quantum
leap in technology,

21:03.471 --> 21:04.677
you're gonna
find freelancers.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.504
They might not be doing
theinvenﬂng,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.760
but they're at least
pulling the strings.

21:09.644 --> 21:10.975
What about Mr. Escher?

21:11.062 --> 21:12.097
JASON: Checkmate.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.180
(CHUCKLES) He'sjust
running his own agenda.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.186
He's a freelancer
of a different stripe.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.360
What I don't understand is,
why are they after you?

21:20.697 --> 21:22.858
Because they can only
do what they do

21:22.949 --> 21:24.735
if no one sees them
for who they are.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.535
And you pose a threat
because”.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.699
Because I know.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.744
And they know
that you know.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.787
And now they know
that you know.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.789
We both sound like
we're off our meds.

21:33.877 --> 21:34.957
Well, they depend on that.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.751
You call them out on it,
they'll just say you're crazy.

21:38.423 --> 21:41.381
I assume they can travel
back and forth?

21:42.886 --> 21:45.798
Oh. You want to
catch a ride home.

21:46.723 --> 21:47.883
I didn't say that.

21:49.684 --> 21:50.639
You know,

21:50.727 --> 21:53.560
you won't be the same person
you were when you left.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.391
The longer I stay here,

21:57.775 --> 21:59.390
the more the future
starts slipping away.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.147
One day you're gonna
wake up and just wonder

22:02.238 --> 22:04.103
if any of it ever
really happened.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.405

off all her clothes

these two have in common

22:21.883 --> 22:23.248
is Flash in their systems.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.667
SO now you wanna tell me
what happens

22:25.762 --> 22:27.969
when someone decides to put
this into the water supply?

22:28.056 --> 22:29.091
We are nowhere with this.

22:29.182 --> 22:32.140
With all due respect, sir,
we've got our hands full
with these gang murders.

22:32.227 --> 22:33.683

it's all connected.

What?

22:35.230 --> 22:37.016
Sorry, I thought this was
important.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.768
Carlos asked me to track
high-level Coalition Kings.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.895
CARLOS: Gabriel.
You know him?

22:42.278 --> 22:43.688
Yeah, we've got
some history.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.236
He's next in line
to lead the Kings,

22:45.323 --> 22:47.359
but he went underground when
they started stacking bodies.

22:47.450 --> 22:48.951
BETTY: Well, it looks
like he just surfaced.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.447
I've got GPS coordinates
on an old cell phone
we're tracking.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.994
Nice, good work, Betty.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.910
Maybe Gabriel can
lead us to Sonya.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.865
It's about time
something broke our way.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.794
If we can find him,
so can Travis.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.543
It's not gonna end,
is it?

23:06.052 --> 23:07.838
Not till one of you dies.

23:08.471 --> 23:09.711
I didn't start this war.

23:09.806 --> 23:10.795
But you can end it.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.050
I intend to.

want to go along

a target.

to build new ranks.

kind of rough.

I know you really don't
know me all that well,

24:12.076 --> 24:13.532
Sure, I guess.

they say it is?

I must have been in the
ambulance after the accident,

24:31.929 --> 24:34.466
In my head Iwas
bodysurfing in Oahu.

24:34.557 --> 24:35.797
You remembered bodysurfing?

I was there!

when I rode the wave...

24:44.692 --> 24:46.899
And this experience,

24:47.862 --> 24:50.228
did you choose to remember it,
or did itjust happen?

24:51.741 --> 24:54.574
I think it was
a choice, why?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.867
There's some things
my dad told me
before he died.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.248
Things I didn't understand.

25:02.877 --> 25:05.209
Things I have
to understand now.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.081
But I realize that's
not a possibility.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.165
It is possible, Alec,

25:11.636 --> 25:13.172
that's what I'm trying
to tell you.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.636
But...

25:16.766 --> 25:18.051
I don't know if
you can trust it.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.594
I don't understand.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.343

25:22.897 --> 25:24.762
It was never that
perfect in real life.

Maybe all you see is
what you hope is true.

25:38.496 --> 25:39.952
If I didn't know any better,

25:40.039 --> 25:41.495
I'd say you were trying
to avoid me.

What are you doing here?

25:43.835 --> 25:45.951

Right.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.384

giving some thought

25:55.471 --> 25:56.847
to formalizing
our arrangement?

25:57.306 --> 25:58.842
Yeah, I've given it
some thought.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.057

26:01.144 --> 26:02.350
I'm gonna need more time.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.801

I still gotta bring you
in for questioning.

on our friend back there.

get close to him.

and the Coalition Kings

28:47.018 --> 28:48.633
to take out Travis.

to pay for it, right?

Then the divide is done,
all we have to do is conquer.

28:54.358 --> 28:57.600
Sure, but if either one of
them wins their private war,

28:57.695 --> 28:59.936
then they come out of this
twice as strong.
