WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:05.297
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.380 --> 00:08.592
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.675 --> 00:11.929
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:12.012 --> 00:15.057
On which we used to rely?

00:15.140 --> 00:18.519
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.602 --> 00:21.772
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.855 --> 00:23.398
All the things
that make us

00:23.482 --> 00:25.150
Laugh and cry

00:25.234 --> 00:30.197
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:34.618 --> 00:37.329
ANNOUNCER: We now return to The
Adventures of Aquaman.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.585
(sonar hum)

00:44.753 --> 00:45.879
Yeah?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.756
Hey, uh, can you, uh,
grab me another beer?

00:47.840 --> 00:50.634
Uh, yeah. Anything
else? Maybe, you know, TV Guide,

00:50.717 --> 00:52.845
you know, another--
another pillow for your feet or something?

00:52.928 --> 00:54.429
No. Actually-- actually, you know what?
Get me, like, a...

00:54.513 --> 00:56.306
Get me, like,
a Dewar's and soda, and, uh,

00:56.390 --> 00:59.601
you know, try to keep the saltwater
out of it, if you could.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.020
-(stammering) Try to keep the saltwater...
-Yeah.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.690
W-We're surrounded by saltwater,
you know. It's kind of difficult.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.942
I know. I'm just saying,
I'm just saying, try.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.944
Yeah, okay, I'll try.
You want me to wipe your ass, too?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.737
Oh, wow, that's
a helpful tone.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.406
I'm just saying, you're
kind of abusing your powers a little bit,

01:12.489 --> 01:14.032
-don't you think?
-Actually--Actually...

01:14.116 --> 01:16.243
This is all time that could be spent
getting me my beverage.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.953
Hey, what are
you guys doin'?

01:18.036 --> 01:19.913
We got to get ready
for your grandpa's 80th birthday dinner.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.832
Peter, calm down.
He's just your father.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.458
Yeah, but I love him.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.336
His folksy racism,
his I-don't-care-where-I-am flatulence.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.088
And the way
it always seems like he's chewin',

01:28.172 --> 01:29.923
even when there's
no food in there.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.717
(doorbell ring)

01:31.800 --> 01:33.135
Hi-ya, Dad.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.512
Francis, it's so good
to see you.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.473
Lois, you haven't
changed a bit, you lyin' bitch.

01:38.557 --> 01:42.477
Ha ha ha. Francis, why
don't you come into the dining room, huh?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.855
The table's all set for
your birthday dinner.

01:44.938 --> 01:49.276
Uh, Lois, actually, Dad said he would
prefer it if you did not join us,

01:49.359 --> 01:51.987
uh, you know, you
bein' a Protestant and all. Um...

01:52.070 --> 01:53.906
He said it's okay if you
sit at the kid's table.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.866
Peter, I cooked
the damn dinner.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.202
Ah! You know, I knew
you were going to react like this,

01:58.285 --> 02:00.996
and that's why I brought Bill Lumbergh
to explain it to you.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.415
Yeah, I'm gonna
need you to go ahead

02:03.498 --> 02:05.876
and not complain
about this.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.713
Oh, and if you could
go ahead and sit at the kids' table,

02:09.796 --> 02:11.465
that'd be great.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.428
I'm just saying, '70s
boobs were different. I don't know.

02:16.512 --> 02:19.473
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to contribute to the conversation.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.517
Dad, tell us
about World War I

02:21.600 --> 02:24.061
and how America defeated
Kaiser Permanente.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.897
Lois, when are you
going to get that baby baptized?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.732
Oh, God, not this again.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.318
Francis, why the hell
is this always an issue with you?

02:31.401 --> 02:33.570
Because I love
this family

02:33.654 --> 02:35.948
and I don't want
my grandson to burn in hell.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.783
I love you, Grandpa.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.161
Your toenails
are the same color as my school bus.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.871
He... You really
think that

02:42.955 --> 02:45.374
splashing magic water
on Stewie will keep him out of hell?

02:45.457 --> 02:48.460
Watch that kind of talk
or you'll get your heathen head smacked.

02:48.544 --> 02:49.920
Oh, that's
very Christian.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.421
"Believe what I say
or I'll hurt you."

02:51.505 --> 02:52.881
Now you're gettin' it.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.969
Peter,
we have a problem.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.720
Hey, hang on, Lois.
I'm watchin' a movie.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.640
-ANNOUNCER: And now back to
-Jaws V: Fire Island.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.600
You think we should
be this far out?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.395
Stop worrying, Mark.
We'll be fine.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.647
Hey, I'm gonna
eat you all.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.108
I'm gonna eat
that hairy leg.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.443
I'm gonna eat
that one, too.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.863
Oh, I can see
right up them shorts.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.116
I got a whole bunch
of rows of teeth to chew you with.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.493
(singing Jaws music)

03:21.577 --> 03:23.036
Oh, now wait a minute.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.873
I did have a chubby kid
on a raft earlier today.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.709
It's okay, though.
I've been swimmin' a lot lately.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.752
Mmm. Yummy. Mmm.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.671
Peter, your father
won't let up

03:32.754 --> 03:34.339
about Stewie
getting baptized.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.799
I am sick of him

03:35.883 --> 03:37.593
always tryin' to
force his religious views on us.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.636
All right, I'll talk
to him, Lois, but, uh,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.263
you know, when my father
wants somethin',

03:41.346 --> 03:42.806
it's like sex
with Kobe Bryant.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.725
You can kick and
scream all you want,

03:44.808 --> 03:47.102
but it's--it's
gonna happen.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.190
Dad, what are you doin'?

03:51.273 --> 03:52.900
There's no
cross in here.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.693
Every kitchen
needs a crucifix.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.445
Listen, Dad, I--I gotta
talk to you. Um...

03:56.528 --> 03:59.531
Lois was wonderin'
if maybe you could, uh,

03:59.615 --> 04:02.075
I don't know, ease
up on the whole, uh,

04:02.159 --> 04:05.704
you know, Jesus-ay
Christ-ay, if you catch my drift.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.664
You're a lapsed
Catholic, Peter.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.458
Your wife's
a Protestant whore

04:09.541 --> 04:11.168
and your baby
isn't even baptized.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.377
All right, all right,
look, Dad...

04:12.461 --> 04:13.879
I--I don't want you
to hate me, all right?

04:13.962 --> 04:15.088
So I'll make
a deal with you.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.757
If we get
Stewie baptized,

04:16.840 --> 04:18.258
you and all
other old people

04:18.342 --> 04:20.344
have to acknowledge
and be aware

04:20.427 --> 04:22.346
that there's crap in the
corners of your mouth.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.598
I'll think about it.
Now let's go.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.934
Old people are gross,
no matter how cute

04:27.017 --> 04:29.228
-they try to make them look on
-Desperate Housewives.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.522
Go ahead. Switch over
to ABC for five seconds.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.232
I'll wait.
I'll wait five seconds.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.820
Oh, my God, did you see?

04:38.904 --> 04:40.864
Did you see how old
and ugly they are?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.824
Oh, my God, that
redhead looks like

04:42.908 --> 04:45.327
somebody pulled
Silly Putty over their knee.

04:47.663 --> 04:51.625
I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin,
but I can't baptize little Stewie today.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.378
It turns out our
last shipment of holy water is tainted.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.339
Tainted? Holy water?
How did that happen?

04:59.675 --> 05:01.343
(toilet flushing)

05:05.639 --> 05:08.350
We'll call you when we
get a new shipment in.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.311
There's no such thing
as tainted holy water.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.938
Come on. We'll
do it ourselves.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.982
Stewie Griffin,
I baptize you

05:15.065 --> 05:16.859
in the name of
the Father, the Son

05:16.942 --> 05:18.735
-and the Holy Ghost.
-And Space Ghost.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.612
What are you doing?
Oh, my God!

05:20.696 --> 05:23.532
This is almost as
bad as my bath with Kathy Bates.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.704
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna get out.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.458
(moaning)

05:33.542 --> 05:35.627
Stewie,
you don't look so good.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.963
Oh, baby,
you're burnin' up!

05:38.046 --> 05:41.091
Oh, my God!
Stewie, Stewie, speak to me!

05:41.175 --> 05:44.803
Don't... Don't take me
to a black doctor.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.183
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I've examined your son

05:49.266 --> 05:51.351
and he is suffering from
a temporary toxic anemia

05:51.435 --> 05:53.353
which has substantially
weakened his immune system.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.605
Is he gonna die?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.815
No, but he's highly
vulnerable to infection

05:56.899 --> 05:59.651
and must be quarantined
in a germ-free plastic environment.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.279
My God, you mean
like John Travolta in that movie?

06:02.362 --> 06:05.657
Oh, no, you're gonna
take his face off, like in Face/Off?

06:05.741 --> 06:08.202
Well, it looks like
the operation was a success.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.287
Do you know what
the best part of this is?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.580
Try licking yourself.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.333
You bastard!

06:14.416 --> 06:16.835
-Peter, he meant The Boy in the
-Plastic Bubble.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.587
How could this
have happened?

06:18.670 --> 06:21.215
It's obvious to me that Stewie's been
exposed to tainted holy water.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.468
Peter, you had Stewie
baptized behind my back?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.094
Come on, honey.
This is no worse

06:26.178 --> 06:27.513
than when I rented
out your uterus

06:27.596 --> 06:28.931
to those inner city
immigrants.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.517
(Latin dance music)

06:31.600 --> 06:32.601
(gunshots)

06:32.684 --> 06:34.228
(tires screeching)

06:34.311 --> 06:37.564
Peter, you're a
complete slave to your father's religion.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.858
What about your
religious beliefs, huh?

06:39.942 --> 06:41.652
You have a choice,
you know.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.237
-I do?
-Of course.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.240
You're a grown man.
You can pick any religion you want.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.158
Really? Hah!

06:48.242 --> 06:49.868
You know, Lois,
maybe you're right.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.954
Maybe I should
pick my own religion.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.413
The question
is, which one?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.874
I'll tell you what
you can pick. A tune out on that piano.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.961
Fatty's in a little jam,
dead girl, dead girl

06:59.044 --> 07:00.295
Fatty's in a lit...

07:00.379 --> 07:02.297
Oh, now how the
whiz-bang does the rest of it go?

07:02.381 --> 07:03.715
Quick!
Make something up!

07:03.799 --> 07:07.219
(jaunty tune)

07:15.602 --> 07:18.230
Peter, what are all
these women doin' in our livin' room?

07:18.313 --> 07:21.024
Lois, I took your
advice and picked a new religion.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.401
I'm gonna be a Mormon.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.278
A Mormon? Are you sure?

07:24.361 --> 07:26.280
Come on.
Nailin' a different wife every night?

07:26.363 --> 07:27.906
That's a no-brainer.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.576
Oh, Lois, this is Kimmy,
the checkout girl from the Korean market.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.619
Uh, Nancy, our
postal carrier.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.663
And you know Tiffany,
the filthy woman

07:34.746 --> 07:36.498
who stands downtown
and screams at traffic.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.876
I ate a tube of Crest
for dinner!

07:38.959 --> 07:40.252
Isn't she funny?

07:40.335 --> 07:42.963
She's definitely
the Kramer of my Mormon wives.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.339
Nancy, get me a beer.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.050
Uh, Mormons aren't
allowed to drink alcohol.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.432
Peter, did you just
throw those women away?

07:53.515 --> 07:54.975
No. Maybe.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.565
Also in the news,
some trouble at St. Phillips Church.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.067
That's right, Diane.
A shipment of tainted holy water

08:04.151 --> 08:06.236
could put some local
babies in jeopardy.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.905
Sounds dangerous, Tom.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.990
Be careful next time
you're at confession telling the priest

08:10.073 --> 08:12.284
about cheating on
your wife with that Filipino drag queen.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.328
Well, at least you're
in no danger, Diane,

08:14.411 --> 08:16.580
since you only visit
church to leave your self-delivered,

08:16.663 --> 08:18.624
unwashed, half-dead
newborns on the back step.

08:18.707 --> 08:22.461
Coming up, how to turn
your unwanted change into foldin' money.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.255
You know, it's kind of
sad seeing Stewie in that plastic bubble.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.466
I think
he looks like a bunny.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.343
Oh, that's it, Chris,
keep laughing.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.386
When I get out of here,
you're going to get it.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.555
I'll lull you into
a false sense of security

08:33.639 --> 08:35.766
like those network
television announcers.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.976
CHIRPY ANNOUNCER:
Tonight on an all-new Mama's Family,

08:38.060 --> 08:40.270
Mama's got more than
she can handle with the in-laws in town.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.523
DRAMATIC ANNOUNCER:
Then, a deadly fire could spell death

08:42.606 --> 08:45.359
for a honeymoon couple
on an all-new Hotel.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.070
Tonight on Newhart,
the stockings are stuffed with comedy

08:48.153 --> 08:49.488
when Bob has to
play Santa Claus.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.782
Then, a sniper's bullet
threatens a partnership

08:51.865 --> 08:53.575
on an all-new
Cagney and Lacey.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.536
-Tonight on a laugh-out-loud
-Night Court,

08:55.619 --> 08:57.412
love is in the air
when Judge Harry's

08:57.496 --> 08:59.206
old high-school
flame comes to town.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.042
Then, a child's death
could mean the case of Arnie Becker's life

09:02.125 --> 09:03.544
on an all-new L.A. Law.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.795
That's Night Court
at 8:00.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.130
L.A. Law at 9:00.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.341
Now remember, kids,
don't touch Stewie.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.385
He's not allowed to have
any human contact.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.887
(phone rings)

09:13.971 --> 09:15.514
Hey, finish
the job, idiot!

09:15.597 --> 09:17.140
For God's sakes,
there's no ventilation!

09:17.224 --> 09:19.184
It smells like
Brian Dennehy in here!

09:19.268 --> 09:21.019
I see London,
I see France,

09:21.103 --> 09:23.397
I see Stewie's
unsightly chapped ass.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.149
Hey, Gay-beau,
I'm up here. Up here.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.401
(doorbell rings)

09:27.484 --> 09:29.695
Hi, my name's Peter.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.072
I'm a Jehovah's
Witness, here to spread the good news

09:32.155 --> 09:33.699
of the story
of Jesus Christ.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.409
Okay, go ahead.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.743
Really?

09:36.827 --> 09:38.537
Wow. Um...

09:38.620 --> 09:41.707
Boy, you're the, uh, first person
who didn't, uh, slam the door on me.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.293
Uh, okay, um, well,

09:44.376 --> 09:48.172
uh, Jesus, uh, was
a miracle worker, of sorts.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.049
Um, he would travel
from place to place,

09:51.133 --> 09:53.385
putting things right
that once went wrong

09:53.468 --> 09:56.096
and hoping each time
that his next leap

09:56.180 --> 09:57.681
would be the leap home.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.058
( Quantum Leap
whooshing noise)

10:01.810 --> 10:02.978
Mmm.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.647
What do you think
you're doin' with my wife?

10:05.731 --> 10:06.732
Oh, boy.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.026
( Quantum Leap music)

10:12.237 --> 10:14.198
The pathway to
enlightenment

10:14.281 --> 10:16.617
starts with
an unfettered, focused mind.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.743
(exclaiming) Look out!

10:17.826 --> 10:19.453
What are you doing?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.997
Oh? I thought that dot on your head
was from a sniper rifle.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.167
Peter, this spot
is a sacred adornment.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.294
It's a portal,
an opening through which

10:27.377 --> 10:30.172
all light, goodness,
rejuvenation, joy and ecstasy

10:30.255 --> 10:32.216
may enter the
human form.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.676
-A vagina?
-Get out.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.643
Hey, Stewie, 3:00.
Time for The View.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.061
No! No, no! Not again!

10:44.144 --> 10:49.233
(chickens clucking)

10:54.112 --> 10:56.740
Let me out of here!
I can't watch another second!

10:59.493 --> 11:01.828
Relax, Stewie.
The doctor gave me this

11:01.912 --> 11:03.539
so you can get
some exercise.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.374
Boy, Stewie's
more wound up

11:05.457 --> 11:08.001
than Dad was that time
he took steroids.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.295
Peter, could you please
pass the potatoes?

11:10.379 --> 11:11.672
(scream)

11:11.755 --> 11:13.382
Damn it, Meg!

11:15.092 --> 11:16.802
ANNOUNCER: And now,
back to Happy Days.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.679
Ah, that Fonzie
is magic.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.889
I love the way
he hits the jukebox to make it work.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.349
What is it, Mr. C?

11:22.432 --> 11:26.478
Fonz, I--I wanted
to pleasure Marion for our anniversary,

11:26.562 --> 11:29.147
but, as you know,
I have erectile dysfunction.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.942
Oh, there we go.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.443
Thank you, Arthur.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.528
Eh!

11:35.654 --> 11:37.865
Brian,
will you carry me upstairs?

11:37.948 --> 11:39.408
I want to look
at my toys.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.701
No. I'm watching
television.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.578
Come on,
I'm sick.

11:42.661 --> 11:43.871
All right.
Come here.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.212
Oh, Todd,

11:52.296 --> 11:54.464
I feel like we'll
never have a baby of our own!

11:54.548 --> 11:55.632
We will, Kelly.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.176
You just have to
visualize it.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.594
Come on, close
your eyes.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.555
Picture a happy,
healthy baby boy at play.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.348
Now put him in
a magic bubble

12:03.432 --> 12:04.725
and release him
to the universe.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.518
(Stewie screaming)

12:06.602 --> 12:10.355
Uh, honey, now I
want you to visualize Lindsay Lohan,

12:10.439 --> 12:12.941
only, naked and
doing a backwards crab-walk.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.359
-What?
-Just do this for me!

12:16.612 --> 12:18.780
Ah, Peter! Where have
you been, lad?

12:18.864 --> 12:21.200
Well, Dad,
I was trying to find my own religion,

12:21.283 --> 12:22.451
but it didn't work out.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.911
I haven't been
this disappointed

12:23.994 --> 12:25.370
since I lost
my virginity.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.164
(crowd cheering)

12:29.041 --> 12:30.584
Ah! Uh-oh.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.461
You want to get
some breakfast or somethin'?

12:32.544 --> 12:33.921
You want to
find religion,

12:34.004 --> 12:36.840
all you got to do is
look in your heart.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.592
Who's always been
there for you,

12:38.675 --> 12:40.385
offerin' wisdom
and truth?

12:40.469 --> 12:42.221
You've known him
all along, Son.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.847
Now worship him!

12:43.931 --> 12:45.933
Oh, my God! Dad's right!

12:46.016 --> 12:47.768
There is only one person

12:47.851 --> 12:50.562
and it's time
for him to be properly worshiped.

12:50.646 --> 12:53.315
I, Peter Griffin,
hereby establish

12:53.398 --> 12:56.193
the First United Church
of the Fonz.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.987
Fonzie, if this
be your will, give me a sign.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.656
(doorbell rings)

13:02.741 --> 13:04.284
Hi, I'm Lindsay Lohan.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.869
This is how
a crab walks.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.580
It sure is!
Fonzie be praised!

13:15.671 --> 13:17.256
All right, Dad.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.383
Two days ago,
this was an old barn.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.803
And now, thanks to you,
it's an old barn with a sign on it.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.304
All things are possible

13:24.388 --> 13:26.348
through the Lord God,
Arthur Fonzarelli, son.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.767
So, you're really
going through with this?

13:28.851 --> 13:31.770
Absolutely.
You know this place only cost me $100?

13:31.854 --> 13:34.690
That's a better deal than
that Aaron Neville megaphone I bought.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.316
Okay, I wanna
thank you guys

13:36.400 --> 13:38.443
for making me
Activity Director for the day.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.028
Okay, first of all,
can every...

13:40.112 --> 13:42.406
...body...

13:42.489 --> 13:43.657
What the hell?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.075
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.451
Uh, okay, uh,

13:46.535 --> 13:47.578
we're about
to start the...

13:47.661 --> 13:50.497
...sack race

13:52.332 --> 13:54.126
Peter, it's not
a good idea

13:54.209 --> 13:56.295
to be puttin' these
flyers all over town.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.963
People are gonna
think you're crazy.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.840
Hey, how'd you
like to lose a bunch of teeth?

13:59.923 --> 14:00.924
I'm sorry, Lois,

14:01.008 --> 14:02.634
that was way more than
what was called for,

14:02.718 --> 14:04.887
but that's what happens
when you challenge someone's faith.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.264
Oh, Peter, I know this
is important to you,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.725
but I don't wanna
see you humiliated.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.018
I don't think anyone's

14:11.101 --> 14:12.895
gonna wanna
worship the Fonz.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.313
Is this the
Church of the Fonz?

14:14.396 --> 14:15.397
Yes, it is.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.481
I read your flier.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.150
Finally, a religion
that makes sense to me.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.110
Hey, everyone. I
found him. Over here.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.029
(clamoring)

14:23.447 --> 14:24.531
Oh, there you are.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.575
You would not believe
the morning I've had!

14:26.658 --> 14:29.328
(machine revving up)

14:29.411 --> 14:34.374
(funky '70s music)

14:34.458 --> 14:36.376
One, two, three,
four, five, six,seven, eight

14:36.460 --> 14:38.545
nine, ten,
eleven, twelve

14:43.800 --> 14:45.928
One, two, three,
four, five, six,seven, eight

14:46.011 --> 14:48.013
nine, ten,
eleven, twelve

14:53.685 --> 14:55.103
Twelve!

14:55.646 --> 15:01.401
(church organ music)

15:03.028 --> 15:04.696
What in blazes is this?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.448
I thought you said
we were going to church.

15:06.532 --> 15:09.159
This is church, Francis,
a new church,

15:09.243 --> 15:10.869
created by a man
who was brave enough

15:10.953 --> 15:12.162
to follow his
own vision.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.290
Please rise.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.292
Now sit on it.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.044
The Fonz be with you.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.128
And also with you.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.922
Let us "Eh."

15:22.005 --> 15:23.674
"Eh."

15:23.757 --> 15:26.009
Wow, I can't believe
people are actually buying this.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.761
Hey, Fonzie's
cool, Brian.

15:27.845 --> 15:28.846
You see, deep down,

15:28.971 --> 15:30.055
I think we all
secretly yearn

15:30.138 --> 15:31.390
to be Italian
and stupid.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.267
A reading from the
letters of Potsie

15:33.350 --> 15:34.560
to the Tuscaderos.

15:34.643 --> 15:37.688
Yea, and did Fonzie
downstairs cometh

15:37.771 --> 15:39.898
from his apartment
above the garage.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.275
And sayeth he,

15:41.358 --> 15:44.736
"Reassembleth will
I the pieces of my motorcycle,

15:44.820 --> 15:47.573
"though I suffereth from
temporary blindness.

15:47.656 --> 15:52.494
"And yea, for I am holy,
befriendeth I will Sticks Downey,

15:52.578 --> 15:55.414
the only Negro in
the state of Wisconsin." Amen.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.498
CONGREGATION: Amen.

15:59.501 --> 16:00.919
(sniffing)

16:01.003 --> 16:02.462
Brian, what's
that smell?

16:02.546 --> 16:03.547
Black spray paint.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.090
What were you painting?

16:05.174 --> 16:07.843
STEWIE: Oh, you think
you're sooo funny!

16:07.926 --> 16:10.929
Well, as soon as I figure out where I am,
you're dead, Brian!

16:11.013 --> 16:12.764
(screaming)

16:12.848 --> 16:14.850
Damn it, I haven't been this dizzy
since I did those helium whippets

16:14.933 --> 16:16.143
at that birthday party.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.854
Okay, okay, ready?
Here goes.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.273
(in high voice)
I'm a female. I have a high voice.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.525
I have reproductive
organs inside of me.

16:23.609 --> 16:25.152
And I buy groceries.

16:25.235 --> 16:28.572
Peter, your religion
is an abomination.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.658
I never thought you
could ever embarrass me more in a church

16:31.742 --> 16:33.535
than you did
at your cousin Mary's wedding.

16:33.619 --> 16:35.579
And if anyone
knows of any reason

16:35.662 --> 16:37.414
why these two
should not be married,

16:37.497 --> 16:38.498
let him speak now.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.752
Really?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.962
Nobody's gonna
speak up?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.256
I'm the one who's
gonna have to say it?

16:46.340 --> 16:48.133
(sigh)
All right.

16:48.217 --> 16:50.511
Genital warts.

16:50.594 --> 16:51.970
But, Dad, you're
the one who said

16:52.054 --> 16:53.305
I should look
into my heart

16:53.388 --> 16:54.389
to find my religion.

16:54.473 --> 16:55.974
Yes. Real religion.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.101
What I saw today
wasn't religion.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.103
It was just a bunch
of sheep, singing songs

17:00.187 --> 17:02.356
and listening to
ridiculous tall tales.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.524
Actually,
that is religion.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.858
Shut your trap, Brian.

17:04.942 --> 17:05.984
STEWIE: Hah!
You tell him.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.278
Why? I agree with you.
All Peter's done

17:08.362 --> 17:10.322
is found another
way to exploit people's ignorance,

17:10.405 --> 17:11.448
and that's just wrong.

17:11.532 --> 17:13.075
You think I'm wro...

17:13.158 --> 17:15.577
(stammering)

17:15.661 --> 17:17.871
See, Brian,
that's a word the Fonz can't say,

17:17.955 --> 17:20.707
because all is right
when you welcome Fonzie into your life.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.209
Fonzie be with you.

17:22.292 --> 17:23.627
I ought to take
off my belt

17:23.710 --> 17:25.337
and slap the
crap out of him.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.090
Look, Francis.
I don't like you and you don't like me.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.092
But I suggest we set
aside our differences

17:30.175 --> 17:31.301
and work together.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.928
I have an idea
of how to snap Peter out of this.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.597
Work together?
You and me?

17:35.681 --> 17:37.808
Sure, sometimes
opposites work well together.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.059
In fact, Peter
taught me that.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.561
Two steps forward

17:40.644 --> 17:43.146
I take two
steps back

17:43.230 --> 17:44.565
We come together

17:44.648 --> 17:46.525
'Cause I'm dressed like a cat

17:46.608 --> 17:48.402
And you know it ain't fiction

17:48.485 --> 17:51.405
Just a natural fact

17:51.488 --> 17:52.948
We come together

17:53.031 --> 17:55.993
'Cause I'm dressed like a cat

17:57.995 --> 17:59.830
Reverend Peter,
I gotta talk to you.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.499
Last night I had sex
with a teenage blond and her mother.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.251
Well, that's quite
a story, Quagmire,

18:04.334 --> 18:06.378
but my church doesn't
have confession.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.130
So there's really
no reason for you to tell me.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.840
Are you kiddin'?
I'm tellin' everybody!

18:09.923 --> 18:11.550
Giggity goo ga!

18:13.385 --> 18:16.096
Let us pause to reflect
on the sacred mystery

18:16.180 --> 18:18.432
of Richie's elder
brother, Chuck,

18:18.515 --> 18:22.019
who ascended the stairs
with his basketball in season one

18:22.102 --> 18:24.104
and never came
down again.

18:24.188 --> 18:25.981
There's just one
problem, Peter.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.357
When a religion
gets too powerful,

18:27.441 --> 18:28.817
it's bound to
have imitators.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.360
What are you
talkin' about?

18:30.444 --> 18:32.237
Hi. I'm Sherman Hemsley

18:32.321 --> 18:33.322
and I've just
established

18:33.405 --> 18:34.489
the Church of
George Jefferson.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.033
Who wants to move on up?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.410
(excited chatter)

18:39.870 --> 18:41.079
Hi, I'm Gavin MacLeod

18:41.163 --> 18:42.206
and I've just
established

18:42.289 --> 18:43.498
the Church of
Captain Stubing.

18:43.582 --> 18:44.833
Who wants to
come on board?

18:44.917 --> 18:47.669
(excited chatter)

18:47.753 --> 18:49.087
Hi, I'm Kirk Cameron.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.631
Oh, great! You here
to convert people

18:50.714 --> 18:52.174
to the Church
of Mike Seaver?

18:52.257 --> 18:54.426
No, I'm here to
convert people to Christianity.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.845
(uncertain muttering)
MAN 1: Okay.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.223
MAN 2: Well, he was
on Growing Pains.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.391
I can't believe it.
Everybody's gone.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.894
Well, people like that
are always lookin' for the next voice

19:03.977 --> 19:05.270
to tell 'em what to do.

19:05.354 --> 19:07.689
And here I was,
thinkin' I was makin' a difference.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.067
I thought I was actually
connectin' with people.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.569
Could there be
anyone stupider than me?

19:14.112 --> 19:15.280
Madonna?

19:15.364 --> 19:17.032
Oh, yeah.
She's pretty stupid.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.909
That-- That's something
we can all agree on, right, right?

19:18.992 --> 19:20.035
Absolutely,
yeah. Francis?

19:20.118 --> 19:22.371
Oh, major idiot.
Major idiot.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.789
Yeah, yeah. Well, gosh!

19:23.872 --> 19:26.041
I guess we do have
some common ground here after all, huh?

19:26.124 --> 19:28.627
Yeah.
And La Isla Bonita, not a real place.

19:28.710 --> 19:29.878
I--I looked it up.
Couldn't find it.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.129
Bought a globe.
Couldn't find it.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.673
Oh, yeah? That
makes her a liar, too.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.508
-She's awful.
-Awful, awful woman.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.426
-I agree, yeah.
-And she's a whore.

19:36.510 --> 19:37.511
Oh yeah, big time.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.680
Oh, everybody.
A Canseco? Ew!

19:39.763 --> 19:41.515
Dennis Rodman.
Dennis Rodman, right.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.475
Rodman? My God!

19:43.559 --> 19:45.227
I think he lost
all his money, didn't he?

19:45.310 --> 19:47.771
Rodman lost?
You sure you're not thinking of MC Hammer?

19:47.855 --> 19:49.523
No, no, I think...
Well, him, too.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.441
I read somewhere,
I think it was in like,

19:51.525 --> 19:52.860
like Stuff, or is it...

19:52.943 --> 19:55.320
No, no, no. You
know what, it was on Real Sports

19:55.404 --> 19:56.780
with Bryant Gumbel.

19:56.864 --> 19:58.782
And they said that
he's in the poorhouse now, yeah.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.242
You think
she'd do him now?

20:00.325 --> 20:02.911
(stammering) I...
What, would Madonna do Rodman now?

20:02.995 --> 20:04.705
Oh, yeah, no,
'cause it's not about the money.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.123
It's about
pissin' off Daddy.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.666
That's right. She's
got a lot of problems.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.585
-Lot of problems.
-Yeah, we are smarter.

20:09.668 --> 20:12.171
W-W-We are smarter
than--than Madonna.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.673
Oh, no question.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.967
Well, I should
probably get out of these robes.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.350
Oh, look at you.
You're all better.

20:25.434 --> 20:27.603
That's right, Brian.
And you are toast.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.938
I'm gonna get in the
gym, get my lats back

20:30.022 --> 20:31.899
and then me and my
friends from Cobra Kai

20:31.982 --> 20:33.400
are gonna take
you down, man.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.778
Listen, uh,
sorry I had to rain on your parade, Peter.

20:36.862 --> 20:38.363
It's all right, Brian.

20:38.447 --> 20:41.241
I guess the Church of the Fonz
was just a bad idea.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.076
Not really, Peter.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.163
You were preachin'
honesty, friendship, courage.

20:46.246 --> 20:50.250
And if you manage to inspire even
one person to embrace those values

20:50.334 --> 20:51.835
then you are a success.

20:51.919 --> 20:54.755
Thanks, Lois.
But I doubt there's any chance of that.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.011
(claps intro to
Happy Days theme tune)

21:01.094 --> 21:03.722
One, two, three
o'clock, fouro'clock, rock

21:03.805 --> 21:06.350
Five, six, seven
o'clock, eighto'clock, rock

21:06.433 --> 21:08.477
Nine, ten, eleven
o'clock, twelveo'clock, rock

21:08.560 --> 21:11.313
We're gonna
rock around theclock tonight

21:11.396 --> 21:13.982
Put your glad rags on
and join me, hon

21:14.066 --> 21:16.318
We'll have some
fun when theclock strikes one

21:16.401 --> 21:19.071
We're gonna
rock around theclock tonight

21:19.154 --> 21:21.782
We're gonna
rock, rock, rock,till broad daylight

21:21.865 --> 21:26.620
We're gonna rock,
gonna rock, aroundthe clock tonight

21:26.703 --> 21:29.873
When the clock
strikes two,three and four

21:29.957 --> 21:32.543
If the band slows down
we'll yell for more

21:32.626 --> 21:34.962
We're gonna rock
around theclock tonight

21:35.045 --> 21:37.506
We're gonna
rock, rock, rock,till broad daylight

21:37.589 --> 21:39.550
We're gonna rock, gonna rock, around

21:39.633 --> 21:41.552
