00:30.530 --> 00:31.428
[kids clamoring]

00:32.530 --> 00:33.349
[kid] Yay, fight!

00:34.070 --> 00:34.889
[grunts]

00:35.070 --> 00:37.482
-Leave him alone!
-He called me a swear word.

00:37.820 --> 00:40.948
He's wearing the same clothes
as yesterday and he smells.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.787
-[kid chuckling]
-You're a dick.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.655
Hey, man. Here.

00:45.290 --> 00:48.123
I can take care of myself.
You wanna go? Right now.

00:49.090 --> 00:49.909
Nah.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.211

[kids whispering]

01:02.970 --> 01:03.880
[boy shushing]

01:07.440 --> 01:09.510
Titus was born

01:09.610 --> 01:11.601
-Where's your lunch?
-Already ate it.

01:11.690 --> 01:12.850
Out of the trash can!

01:12.940 --> 01:14.237
Shut up! I did not!

01:14.860 --> 01:15.849
Want a sandwich?

01:17.070 --> 01:17.946
No.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.901
Marisa made turkey. I hate turkey.

01:22.620 --> 01:23.496
Not hungry.

01:23.580 --> 01:27.118
Come on, take the sandwich.
And I'll take half your Twinkies.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.620
I don't got Twinkies.

01:31.290 --> 01:36.080
Life is a dream drifting at sea

01:36.170 --> 01:37.330
Hey, those are mine!

01:38.130 --> 01:39.381
And now they're his.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.816
I don't need you to stick up for me.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.771
I know. I just wanted a Twinkie.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.153
[Justin] Bryce and I have been friends
since the third grade.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.863
And so, Titus would grow

02:04.620 --> 02:07.532
Tall and strong as an oak

02:10.250 --> 02:11.456
[Justin] And friendship,

02:12.340 --> 02:14.626
it can be this really powerful thing.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.751
-The fuck are you two doing?
-Just hold on.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.047
He's gonna keep doing it.
We have to stop him.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.880
-Not like this.
-I'm calling the cops.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.347
Just shut the fuck up and hold on, Bryce!

02:24.430 --> 02:27.058
It's never gonna get any better.
You were right to run away.

02:27.140 --> 02:28.129
[Justin] No, I wasn't.

02:28.350 --> 02:30.648
That's why you came and got me,
remember?

02:30.730 --> 02:33.301
-For Jess, for Hannah.
-Hannah wants him dead.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.515
No, I don't think she does.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.312
I don't think she wants
to keep seeing people get hurt.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.356
I don't. Okay?

02:51.250 --> 02:52.911
This is fucking ridiculous.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.620
You're gonna go back inside

02:55.710 --> 02:57.871
and you're gonna pour yourself
another glass of whiskey,

02:57.960 --> 03:00.212
and you're gonna forget
that we were ever here, got it?

03:08.430 --> 03:10.807
I heard they just filed
for another additional witness.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.971
That wouldn't be you
by any chance, would it?

03:15.770 --> 03:17.897
You should be more scared
than you are, Justin.

03:19.610 --> 03:23.159
Bryce, I've got nothing left to lose.

03:24.820 --> 03:26.401
That makes me the dangerous one.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.706
[tires squealing]

03:35.500 --> 03:36.330
What the fuck?

03:37.920 --> 03:38.750
What is it?

03:39.960 --> 03:40.915
We're being followed.

03:44.430 --> 03:45.465
Are you sure?

03:53.690 --> 03:54.509
We'll lose him.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.767
-Dude, it's a Prius.
-And I'm a fucking awesome driver.

04:12.540 --> 04:14.781
[Justin] And friendship is complicated.

04:15.290 --> 04:19.078
You find yourself doing things
you never thought you'd do.

04:21.510 --> 04:23.216
[sighs]

04:23.930 --> 04:24.749
We're clear.

04:25.510 --> 04:26.670
What the hell was that?

04:28.010 --> 04:29.887
Probably the person
fucking with all of us.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.847
-Bryce.
-It wasn't his car.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.089
Well, one of his boys.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.972
Because you're testifying. Tomorrow.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.278
You... You're really gonna do it, right?

04:44.780 --> 04:45.599
Yeah.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.613
[Justin] Because friendship,
you commit to it.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.940
-[knocking on door]
-[Mrs. Standall] Alex?

04:51.040 --> 04:53.076
-[Justin] No matter what.
-[pounding on door]

04:53.160 --> 04:53.990
[Zach] Alex!

04:55.080 --> 04:55.910
Alex!

04:56.000 --> 04:57.285
What? I'm awake.

04:58.670 --> 04:59.489
Oh.

05:00.170 --> 05:01.660
-Hey, guys.
-[Zach] "Hey, guys"?

05:02.050 --> 05:05.838
-Did you not hear us pounding on the door?
-I don't know. I must've fallen asleep.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.467
Alexander Dean Standall.

05:10.760 --> 05:11.590
What is this?

05:11.970 --> 05:14.928
Do you know the damage
these things can do to your health?

05:15.020 --> 05:17.682
The only damage they do
is to the roof of your mouth, Mom.

05:17.770 --> 05:19.510
Well, we're back to a healthy breakfast.

05:22.070 --> 05:23.355
Zach, you're welcome to join.

05:29.410 --> 05:30.866
What's the big emergency?

05:32.240 --> 05:34.037
This is what I woke up to this morning.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.615
12:12 am. "Someone gave me a bullet."

05:36.870 --> 05:38.918
12:13 am. "Someone gave me a gun."

05:39.000 --> 05:41.161
12:37 am. "I figured it all out."

05:41.460 --> 05:45.419
You can't fucking text shit like this
to a person and then fall asleep.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.172
Okay, I couldn't explain more
because my thumbs got tired.

05:48.340 --> 05:51.047
The last time you didn't respond
to my texts or calls, you...

05:53.260 --> 05:54.090
I know.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.384
[sighs]

05:59.060 --> 06:02.439
[sighs] So, what the hell is going on?

06:04.820 --> 06:06.356
I know who's messing with us.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.559
But I don't know where he is.

06:16.330 --> 06:17.456
[Mrs. Jensen] Good morning.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.957
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, Mrs. Jensen, Mr. Jensen.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.450
What the hell happened to you two?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.160
-It was a fight.
-Sports.

06:26.510 --> 06:29.877
Mine... mine was a fight
and his was sports.

06:29.970 --> 06:31.835
I told Dad yesterday. PE.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.307
If someone's hurting you,
we need to know what's going on.

06:35.390 --> 06:37.927
Wait, wha-- What are you doing here?

06:39.310 --> 06:43.895
Well, um, I want to apologize

06:43.980 --> 06:47.859
that, uh, an argument that was largely
between your father and me

06:47.940 --> 06:49.942
had the impact it did on the family.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.019
And on you, Justin.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.019
It wasn't fair.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.658
I feel like I came here
and messed everything up, so--

06:57.750 --> 07:00.366
-No. No, it's not--
-Justin, that's not what happened.

07:00.750 --> 07:01.569
You didn't.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.219
So, you just... You're back?

07:11.220 --> 07:12.039
I'm back.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.966
And I need to speak to Justin privately.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.089
After breakfast.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.432
I heard last night
that you're going to testify today.

07:23.900 --> 07:29.770
And while I like Dennis Vasquez very much,
he does not represent your interests.

07:30.860 --> 07:34.409
I wanna make sure that you understand
everything that's at stake for you

07:34.490 --> 07:35.650
before you testify.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.196
[stammers] What do you mean?
What's at stake?

07:39.950 --> 07:43.204
Clay, I don't want us to have secrets,
but if I'm going to help Justin,

07:43.290 --> 07:46.032
that has to be between the two of us...
for now.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.629
If he chooses to tell you after we talk,
that's up to him.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.710
Can you trust me?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.510
For now.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.478
-[Clay] Well, what did she tell you?
-Nothing important.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.562
Just walked me through
how the day's gonna go.

08:08.770 --> 08:11.682
-What did she say was at stake?
-Mostly everything you already know.

08:12.740 --> 08:13.559
Damn it.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.157
-Do you know how to tie a tie?
-Yes.

08:17.410 --> 08:19.150
[sighs] I'm just nervous, okay?

08:31.050 --> 08:31.948
Oh, I guess...

08:34.880 --> 08:37.758
[sighs] ...doing this sober
is a lot harder than I thought it'd be.

08:39.260 --> 08:43.139
And, you know, I'm gonna have to say stuff
about me and Hannah.

08:43.850 --> 08:46.933
Stuff that you don't... you don't know.

08:49.980 --> 08:54.019
We-- We didn't.
We never had sex or anything like that.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.854
There's just more to the story.

09:00.950 --> 09:02.827
I don't want you to start hating me again.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.030
[Clay sighs]

09:09.340 --> 09:10.375
Who said I stopped?

09:16.430 --> 09:18.250
Just don't lose your shit, okay?

09:20.390 --> 09:22.130
Man, you really freaked me out last night.

09:27.810 --> 09:28.890
Where'd you get the gun?

09:32.900 --> 09:34.356
I borrowed it from a friend.

09:35.990 --> 09:36.809
Well, give it back.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.021
Yeah. No, yeah, for sure.

09:46.910 --> 09:49.788
-Jesus, how do you not know how--?
-[scoffs]

09:49.880 --> 09:52.166
I've seen you in a tie.
Last year at the winter dance.

09:57.170 --> 09:58.876
Bryce used to tie them for me.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.675
I never really learned how.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.097
[Hannah] I like the way
you're taking care of Justin.

10:09.350 --> 10:11.511
He really is just a sweet, injured boy.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.681
Yeah, and girls are suckers for that.

10:15.940 --> 10:19.068
You know, we're also suckers
for the angry, vengeful hero types.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.156
I was gonna kill him, Hannah.

10:26.370 --> 10:27.405
I was ready to.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.030
But is Justin right?

10:34.920 --> 10:36.160
Is that not what you want?

10:38.260 --> 10:39.625
I want you to forgive me.

10:46.270 --> 10:49.137
But maybe that's the one thing
in the world you won't do for me.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.390
[door opens]

10:52.190 --> 10:54.317
Your parents said we could drive together.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.358
And they'll be right behind us
in one of the other Priuses.

11:07.450 --> 11:08.280
Jensen.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.084
Look, I promise you, there's no box
of pictures or anything like that.

11:20.260 --> 11:23.172
This is just fucking Zach making shit up
to make me look bad.

11:23.470 --> 11:25.711
-What happened that night?
-It was your idea to have an audience.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.176
No one forced you to get stoned
out of your mind.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.056
I even warned you not to hit that shit.

11:30.310 --> 11:31.595
What about Hickman's Bridge?

11:33.440 --> 11:36.068
-I thought that was our place.
-Is that why you walked out?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.311
Jesus. Chle, seriously?

11:39.030 --> 11:42.488
It's not like I grill you about every guy
you hooked up with before me, do I?

11:42.570 --> 11:44.481
-Where's the trust?
-What was I supposed to do?

11:44.570 --> 11:47.073
Not walk out. Not testify against me.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.651
You thought that was gonna make you
feel better?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.150
Do you really think
anyone's gonna trust you after that?

11:53.250 --> 11:54.069
[door opens]

11:55.460 --> 11:57.872
[Ms. Childs] Okay,
time for disciplinary matters.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.417
[Dennis] If we're going to establish
a pattern of behavior,

12:00.670 --> 12:03.082
your testimony needs
to contradict his claim

12:03.180 --> 12:05.421
that he's never forced himself
on another student.

12:06.430 --> 12:07.249
Okay.

12:07.470 --> 12:09.961
It all comes down
to whether the jury believes you, so...

12:10.770 --> 12:14.012
Ms. Struhl is gonna do whatever she can
to discredit you on the cross.

12:14.310 --> 12:16.608
She's gonna bring up everything.
Do you understand?

12:19.110 --> 12:21.738
-Yeah, I understand.
-Justin, you can't do this halfway.

12:22.650 --> 12:24.902
If you leave them
any room to doubt you, they will.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.479
Bryce fooled them yesterday.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.571
Yeah, I'll do my best, Mrs. Baker.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.118
Has someone threatened you
about your testimony?

12:36.420 --> 12:38.741
The bruises on your face,
did Bryce do that?

12:38.840 --> 12:39.659
No.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.040
Are you afraid of him?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.465
Not a goddamn bit.

12:49.850 --> 12:50.669
[door opens]

12:51.060 --> 12:53.346
-What the fuck did you do, man?
-Whoa, what's wrong?

12:53.430 --> 12:54.260
What's wrong?

12:54.480 --> 12:55.515
-This is wrong.
-What?

12:55.690 --> 12:57.931
Now they'll know we're not weak.
It's totally punk, right?

12:58.020 --> 13:00.568
It's not punk. It's-- It's fucking stupid!

13:01.440 --> 13:05.729
-We're in so much trouble right now.
-Who cares? Fuck the system.

13:05.820 --> 13:08.402
"Fuck the--" My dad is gonna kill me.

13:08.490 --> 13:10.401
He won't. Your dad's cool.

13:10.620 --> 13:14.499
-Not with me getting expelled.
-Okay, so we'll get expelled together.

13:14.580 --> 13:16.741
-[scoffs]
-It doesn't have to stop us.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.029
Stop us from doing what?

13:19.460 --> 13:20.916
From bringing down the system.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.587
Those guns? I have more.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.790
We can really make shit happen.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.961
Like you said,
we can end those motherfuckers.

13:30.050 --> 13:33.759
Dude, that was just me saying shit.
That was just me talking, man.

13:34.020 --> 13:37.228
Are you serious right now?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

13:39.150 --> 13:43.223
I'll tell them it was all me.
I'll do whatever you want.

13:43.320 --> 13:46.733
No, no, it's fine. We're good.

13:48.490 --> 13:49.309
Um...

13:49.410 --> 13:54.029
I think, you know, we shouldn't hang out
until this thing blows over.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.955
Are we still friends?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.039
Totally.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.808
[Justin] Being friends with him,
it was about loyalty.

14:19.350 --> 14:20.977
But it was also about fear.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.313
[Dennis] And how would you describe
Mr. Walker's relationships with girls?

14:27.740 --> 14:30.231
-Were they fear-based as well?
-Yes, sir.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.276
They were like conquests to him.

14:33.870 --> 14:36.828
He would always brag
about what he'd done with girls.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.247
And then he'd call them sluts
for hooking up with him.

14:40.330 --> 14:43.288
And did he ever_ mentio_n _
an "on again, off again" relationship

14:43.380 --> 14:46.668
-with Hannah Baker to you?
-No, sir, because it never happened.

14:47.130 --> 14:48.085
Maybe they hung out,

14:48.170 --> 14:51.503
but there's no way he would've hooked up
with her and not told me about it.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.638
Because he liked to brag, as you said?

14:54.220 --> 14:55.050
Exactly.

14:55.930 --> 14:57.261
How would you describe Hannah?

14:57.930 --> 15:00.262
She was really kind and funny.

15:01.230 --> 15:02.800
-Ah! [giggles]
-[camera shutter clicking]

15:03.560 --> 15:05.812
[Justin] I liked her
from the first time I saw her.

15:07.230 --> 15:11.815
We only had one real date,
but it was... it was nice.

15:12.450 --> 15:13.610
[Mrs. Foley] Fuck you!

15:13.700 --> 15:16.737
[Justin] I walked her home,
then I went home.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.070
[Seth] Yes, I got you. Okay.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.037
-[Mrs. Foley screaming]
-[objects thudding]

15:22.120 --> 15:24.168
[Seth] Why don't you take care of that?
Why don't...

15:24.250 --> 15:27.458
[Justin] And I got in, like, a fight
with my mom's boyfriend.

15:27.550 --> 15:29.836
-[objects crashing]
-[Seth] Oh, yeah.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.252
[Justin] I texted Hannah,
and she said to come over.

15:32.340 --> 15:34.922
Jesus. Are you sure
you don't want me to call someone?

15:35.010 --> 15:36.750
Yeah. It'll run its course.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.348
Seth will get sick of my mom.
He'll eventually take off.

15:41.850 --> 15:42.839
They usually do.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.140
And what if he doesn't?

15:49.400 --> 15:53.814
Then it gives me more of a reason
to escape to your house, right?

15:57.660 --> 16:00.242
-Thanks, by the way.
-Oh, sure.

16:02.500 --> 16:06.209
[sighs] So, uh, this is my room.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.507
I was kind of saving it
for our third or fourth date, but--

16:09.590 --> 16:11.126
Shit. [laughs]

16:11.470 --> 16:15.213
I usually try to save
the whole "my mom's an addict" thing

16:15.300 --> 16:17.507
till the fourth date, too, so...

16:20.060 --> 16:20.879
Sorry.

16:24.100 --> 16:24.930
Hmm.

16:26.060 --> 16:26.890
You got...

16:27.560 --> 16:30.028
Here, let me-- Let me get you a washcloth.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.698
Oh, my God.

16:32.780 --> 16:33.986
[both laughing]

16:34.070 --> 16:35.697
-Amazing, right?
-Mmm.

16:35.780 --> 16:36.940
Feel free to pass out.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.864
You know, the body, after stress,
just sometimes shuts down.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.051
[Justin] She just let me sleep there
all night.

17:07.770 --> 17:09.226
She slept on her own floor.

17:19.990 --> 17:22.038
Coast is clear.
Front door, bottom of the stairs.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.496
-Okay. Sorry.
-Yeah.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.411
Do you wanna do this again sometime?

17:28.500 --> 17:29.831
[both chuckling]

17:29.920 --> 17:31.626
-Call it date ﬁve?
-Sure.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.159
Sure.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.187
[both chuckling]

17:46.270 --> 17:47.134
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.680
[exhales]

17:58.820 --> 17:59.650
[car honks]

18:04.540 --> 18:06.952
-Why no ride this morning?
-What's up, man?

18:09.170 --> 18:11.411
You're walking
from the completely wrong direction.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.879
Whose bed did you wake up in? [laughs]

18:18.680 --> 18:21.342
[Justin] Iknew Bryce
wasn't gonna leave it alone.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.927
-Justin.
-Get off me, man.

18:24.010 --> 18:25.966
[Justin]
I knew I'd have to tell him something.

18:26.390 --> 18:30.394
I don't know why that was more important
to me than doing right by Hannah.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.017
-Picture's worth a thousand words.
-Oh! [laughs]

18:33.110 --> 18:35.647
[Justin] Friendship, I guess. Being a man.

18:36.530 --> 18:39.772
Wanting him to think
I was more than I was somehow.

18:39.860 --> 18:43.614
-Oh, yeah, we're sending that shit around.
-No, no, Bryce, stop. Seriously, hey!

18:47.160 --> 18:50.493
Maybe Bryce sent it around
because he was jealous.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.792
Or maybe because he's just cruel.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.369
I don't know.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.792
I don't know why people
send around photos like that.

19:05.810 --> 19:09.132
Bryce did shi--
stuff like that all the time.

19:09.850 --> 19:12.478
What is the one thing
I told you about that place?

19:14.110 --> 19:14.929
The one thing.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.475
Be responsible.

19:20.610 --> 19:22.237
You represent this team.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.361
The team is my priority.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.868
Now, I got lawyers talking to me
about a search warrant

19:30.290 --> 19:33.919
and that drugstore being vandalized
a couple nights ago.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.451
You wouldn't know anything, would you?

19:37.550 --> 19:39.871
No. I never go near that store.

19:41.130 --> 19:44.384
This lawyer thinks there's a whole box
of these Polaroids out there somewhere.

19:44.470 --> 19:46.097
I don't wanna know if that's true.

19:47.390 --> 19:51.804
I don't wanna know why you would take
the goddamn pictures in the first place.

19:53.020 --> 19:57.764
I just don't wanna hear any more about it.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.190
Are we understood?

20:04.700 --> 20:05.519
We are.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.743
Tell me what you saw when you went back
into the room that night.

20:11.830 --> 20:15.243
We'll renew our objection.
Irrelevant and inflammatory.

20:15.330 --> 20:18.458
We're establishing that Bryce Walker
engaged in a pattern of behavior

20:18.550 --> 20:19.699
and that the school was aware.

20:20.130 --> 20:23.463
The defense claims no such behavior
took place. We have a right to respond.

20:23.550 --> 20:24.881
Witness will answer.

20:28.010 --> 20:30.558
[stammers] I went back into the room.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.595
Jessica was passed out

20:32.850 --> 20:38.106
and Bryce was standing over her,
and his... his pants were unzipped.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.233
And she had her panties off
and she wasn't moving.

20:43.030 --> 20:46.818
Her eyes were closed.
It-- It was like she was dead.

20:47.990 --> 20:51.369
I tried to pull him off,
but he shoved me out and locked the door.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.451
I just sat there listening.

20:56.540 --> 20:57.620
Listening to him...

21:00.670 --> 21:01.500
and her. It...

21:02.800 --> 21:04.870
It sounded like she started to wake up.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.046
Did you think of calling the police
or calling for help?

21:08.850 --> 21:09.669
I did. I--

21:11.890 --> 21:14.848
-But I was afraid.
-Afraid of what?

21:16.850 --> 21:17.680
I don't know.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.021
Afraid of losing my best friend.

21:24.610 --> 21:25.520
My girlfriend.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.440
My entire life.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.650
Which I guess I already lost.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.069
I'll regret this forever.

21:47.220 --> 21:50.792
-What's up?
-So... they don't know about yesterday,

21:50.890 --> 21:53.131
but he missed
the first three periods today.

21:54.220 --> 21:57.053
-How'd you get that out of Ms. Douglas?
-It's the cane, dude.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.721
Told her that he was supposed
to help me with PT.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.719
But I help you with that.

22:03.730 --> 22:07.564
Clearly it was a lie, Zach.
Oh, my God. What's next?

22:09.070 --> 22:10.059
We need Clay and Tony.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.658
So, you were intoxicated at this party,
is that correct?

22:15.040 --> 22:15.859
Yes.

22:15.950 --> 22:19.033
And you would regularly get drunk
at parties, isn't that true?

22:19.960 --> 22:21.496
Yeah, I guess, sometimes.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.081
And you're a habitual user of heroin,
isn't that correct?

22:24.170 --> 22:25.831
Objection. Relevance?

22:26.300 --> 22:28.256
Goes to capacity and reliability,
Your Honor.

22:28.340 --> 22:29.170
Overruled.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.928
[Sonya] Justin, you're a heroin addict,
isn't that correct?

22:33.350 --> 22:35.636
I wasn't then. I'm in recovery.

22:35.720 --> 22:39.053
And on the night in question,
you brought Jessica upstairs

22:39.140 --> 22:41.301
with the intention
of having sex with her, correct?

22:42.110 --> 22:43.395
I thought it might go there.

22:43.730 --> 22:49.270
And you never actually saw Bryce
and Jessica during intercourse, correct?

22:49.360 --> 22:51.692
-I heard noises.
-Noises that could have been sounds

22:51.780 --> 22:54.328
of two very drunk teenagers
having sex, correct?

22:54.410 --> 22:56.071
No. Jessica was passed out.

22:56.950 --> 22:59.453
She couldn't-- She couldn't speak.

22:59.620 --> 23:02.168
She couldn't speak when you left her.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.036
I literally just left the room.

23:04.130 --> 23:08.294
[Sonya] And when you entered the room,
you saw Bryce standing over her,

23:08.880 --> 23:10.871
not on top of her, correct?

23:11.130 --> 23:12.961
-Yeah, but he shoved me out.
-Mr. Foley,

23:13.050 --> 23:16.053
isn't it true that you never saw Bryce
assault anyone?

23:16.140 --> 23:17.846
-No, that's not true.
-Isn't it true

23:17.930 --> 23:20.057
that you concocted this rape story
to save yourself

23:20.140 --> 23:22.597
from the embarrassment
of what really happened?

23:22.690 --> 23:25.067
Your girlfriend cheated on you
with your best friend.

23:25.150 --> 23:25.969
-No.
-Objection.

23:26.070 --> 23:29.028
And isn't it true that you left town
rather than face the truth?

23:29.110 --> 23:30.987
-No.
-You didn't leave town?

23:31.070 --> 23:33.527
I mean, I left town,
but it was not to avoid any--

23:33.620 --> 23:36.783
And wasn't the heroin
also a way to avoid the truth?

23:36.870 --> 23:38.610
-Objection.
-And aren't you lying now?

23:38.700 --> 23:39.780
-No!
-Asked and answered.

23:39.870 --> 23:41.701
No, I'm telling the truth, I...

23:45.290 --> 23:46.245
He raped her.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.256
I'm telling the truth.

23:55.890 --> 23:58.552
[Clay] The jury's not buying it.
We have to go after him.

23:59.270 --> 24:00.635
And we need those pictures.

24:01.230 --> 24:03.721
-Who would know where he is?
-And why would they tell us?

24:04.350 --> 24:06.227
[bailiff] Two minutes.
Two minutes, please.

24:10.150 --> 24:11.060
I know who to ask.

24:12.820 --> 24:16.574
In the first few years of life,
children rely on their parents.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.368
But there comes a time when every parent
must share their child with the world,

24:21.450 --> 24:23.168
wﬂaxmm

24:24.290 --> 24:26.872
In the hands of the faculty
at Liberty High School,

24:27.420 --> 24:30.662
Hannah Baker was bullied and harassed.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.921
And she asked for help twice.

24:34.760 --> 24:38.139
First, anonymously through a letter
read aloud in class

24:38.220 --> 24:41.018
but ultimately ignored by her teacher.

24:41.310 --> 24:44.222
And then Hannah did what most students
who are suffering do not.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.050
She went to her school counselor.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.313
And she suggested that she had been raped
by a fellow student.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.062
She went to a mandatory reporter for help.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.940
And yet again, her cries were ignored.

25:00.450 --> 25:04.204
Hannah may have been a complicated girl,
as the defense has suggested,

25:05.170 --> 25:06.455
but this case is simple.

25:08.170 --> 25:09.706
Hannah Baker asked for help,

25:11.500 --> 25:13.548
and Liberty High School
failed to provide it.

25:18.890 --> 25:21.347
[Mr. Bolan] We've already spoken
to Cyrus and his father.

25:21.510 --> 25:22.966
Did he tell you it was his idea?

25:23.060 --> 25:25.688
_ He said he was worried _
you might do something more serious.

25:25.940 --> 25:28.556
-What's more serious than this?
-Tyler is a good boy.

25:28.650 --> 25:30.561
Well, yes, he has been, Mrs. Down,

25:30.650 --> 25:35.019
but he's also been very involved
in a number of our challenges of late.

25:35.110 --> 25:37.021
[Mrs. Down stammers]
This is about those tapes?

25:37.110 --> 25:40.238
No, no. It's about felony vandalism.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.941
I understand it's difficult
to hear these things

25:44.250 --> 25:48.038
when your child has not shown a tendency
towards rule-breaking in the past,

25:48.120 --> 25:51.999
but this is the reality
that we find ourselves in now.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.587
And I think our best hope
is to address it head-on.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.119
[Mr. Down] Meaning?

25:57.220 --> 26:00.678
We've decided to refer Tyler
to a diversionary program.

26:00.970 --> 26:04.974
This is a program for kids
who need a kind of behavioral guidance

26:05.350 --> 26:07.056
so that they don't end up
in legal trouble.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.859
And once he completes
the program satisfactorily,

26:10.940 --> 26:13.352
he of course will be welcome back
at Liberty.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.645
What about the other boy?

26:16.030 --> 26:19.022
[Mr. Bolan] Cyrus is gonna be suspended
for a period of time.

26:19.110 --> 26:22.739
-[Mr. Down] How is that fair?
-He did come to us voluntarily to confess,

26:22.830 --> 26:24.445
and he's been very forthcoming.

26:24.540 --> 26:27.998
Well, Tyler will be forthcoming.
Tyler, tell him the truth.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.706
He's not interested in the truth, Mom.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.082
If he did, half the jocks would be
at his stupid diversionary program.

26:35.170 --> 26:36.250
[Mr. Down] Tyler.

26:36.340 --> 26:39.298
They just beat the shit out of kids
in the hallway and nothing happened.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.040
No one does anything.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.807
Many factors contributed
to Hannah Baker's suicide.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.801
Some of which we may never know.

26:52.060 --> 26:53.812
But here is what we do know.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.933
She never reported
any of her conflicts with students

26:58.490 --> 27:01.402
and she never said she was raped.

27:01.910 --> 27:05.653
Her parents never reached out
to the school for any reason.

27:06.490 --> 27:09.243
Hannah was a troubled girl
with issues at home,

27:09.460 --> 27:11.667
a family history
of mental health concerns,

27:11.750 --> 27:14.082
and evidence of low self-esteem.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.160
This was a tragedy.

27:18.340 --> 27:21.047
A promising young life lost.

27:21.930 --> 27:25.843
But school faculty
cannot go home with their students.

27:26.850 --> 27:31.469
I'll leave you with this question.
When do we hold the parents responsible?

27:37.650 --> 27:39.732
So no one has seen that fucking box?

27:42.950 --> 27:45.407
Guys, if those pictures end up
with the wrong person,

27:47.540 --> 27:48.495
I'm-I'm done.

27:49.870 --> 27:50.996
We're all fucking done.

27:51.080 --> 27:54.163
Dude, some of those pictures
are just like partying or whatever.

27:54.250 --> 27:55.706
You think that fucking matters?

27:57.590 --> 27:59.046
We're all in this together now.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.832
[Justin] The truth is
Bryce was never my friend.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.715
Because he doesn't know
what friendship is.

28:15.230 --> 28:16.049
[door closes]

28:17.900 --> 28:18.719
Tyler.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.389
Don't talk to my son.

28:20.780 --> 28:22.190
-Look, Tyler is a great kid.
-Yes.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.692
And he managed to stay out of trouble
until he met your son.

28:24.780 --> 28:26.270
His anger needs to be dealt with.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.651
Now, both of my kids
have seen a therapist since the divorce.

28:29.740 --> 28:32.072
Aw, you see a shrink. How punk rock.

28:32.370 --> 28:34.361
-Shut your mouth. You know nothing.
-Cyrus.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.451
-I know you're a sellout and a narc.
-Yeah? Mm-hmm.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.586
-And a fucking poser!
-Hey!

28:37.670 --> 28:39.626
-[Mrs. Down] What is your problem?
-Let's go!

28:48.100 --> 28:50.637
[gasps] Mom, they're calling him
a drug addict.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.556
All they keep talking about
is how he went missing

28:53.640 --> 28:55.096
and him and Bryce had a falling-out.

28:55.190 --> 28:56.009
They're not even...

28:56.860 --> 28:58.475
God, they're missing the point.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.896
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.487
I know that you had high hopes for Justin.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.903
-But he's a troubled kid.
-We're all troubled kids.

29:12.410 --> 29:13.365
Oh, I know.

29:15.830 --> 29:17.912
Should he try talking
to the police as well?

29:18.250 --> 29:22.129
-There's still a criminal case to be made.
-No. No, that wouldn't do any good.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.751
Because you still don't remember?

29:26.970 --> 29:29.791
Mom, you've seen what they've done
to Hannah in that courtroom.

29:31.390 --> 29:32.880
And look what happened to Chle.

29:33.430 --> 29:35.341
I-- I don't wanna end up back in there.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.396
I don't wanna be on trial.

29:54.040 --> 29:57.112
[Justin] There should be some things
more important than friendship.

29:58.540 --> 30:01.202
-Things you just won't do for a friend.
-[car door closes]

30:01.290 --> 30:02.416
[footsteps approaching]

30:08.130 --> 30:11.042
-Hey, Scotty.
-Bryce is looking for you.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.592
You didn't tell him about this place,
did you?

30:13.890 --> 30:15.517
No, I told you, I never would.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.380
But who are you hiding from this time?

30:20.440 --> 30:23.432
My dad's on a fucking tear, man.
Came after me with a hammer.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.772
So, a few days in the hobo hotel.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.158
-And how come you're here?
-I'm not a rapist, Monty.

30:31.490 --> 30:33.697
[scoffs] Okay.

30:34.490 --> 30:36.446
And I'm sick of people assuming I am.

30:37.910 --> 30:40.287
Look, we've been taking care of Bryce
for too long, man.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.951
-Come on, enough's enough.
-Okay, so what do you want me to do?

30:44.590 --> 30:46.046
Give us the Polaroids back.

30:46.130 --> 30:48.837
-What the fuck, Scotty?
-They told me what you've been doing.

30:49.260 --> 30:51.751
Wait, you're the one who fucking narc'd
about the Clubhouse?

30:52.890 --> 30:54.846
Nope. I did.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.175
Oh, right. Of course you did.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.379
Fuck this. I'm out.

31:01.270 --> 31:03.147
What's the matter, Monty? You scared?

31:10.110 --> 31:12.317
We know what you did.
Running me off the road?

31:12.740 --> 31:13.820
-The target.
-Dead rat.

31:13.910 --> 31:17.402
-My fucking car.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.240
Give us the pictures and we'll let you go.

31:21.210 --> 31:22.029
You'll let me go?

31:23.250 --> 31:25.377
Or what, you're gonna hit me
with your cane again?

31:26.250 --> 31:27.626
-Oh, shit.
-Whoa.

31:28.590 --> 31:29.750
Hey, Alex.

31:30.590 --> 31:33.502
-Alex, where'd you get that gun?
-Monty gave it to me.

31:41.020 --> 31:43.181
Okay. All right.

31:44.190 --> 31:45.726
Yeah, I'll give you the Polaroids.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.390
And then I'm clean. That's the deal.

31:53.530 --> 31:55.862
Fine. So hand them over.

31:56.780 --> 31:59.658
-I have to get them. They're not here.
-I'll go with you.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.457
-A|ex.
-No. I go with him.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.580
[door opens]

32:07.130 --> 32:07.949
[Mr. Bolan] Kevin.

32:11.420 --> 32:17.211
So, uh, the district
has completed its review,

32:17.720 --> 32:21.884
and, uh, they've decided
to terminate your employment.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.385
Effective immediately.

32:24.810 --> 32:25.640
[chuckles]

32:30.740 --> 32:32.446
[grunts, sighs]

32:34.070 --> 32:35.776
[books thudding]

32:38.620 --> 32:39.439
Anything else?

32:39.990 --> 32:41.617
If there's anything I can do...

32:45.630 --> 32:48.246
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.254
You know what you can do?
You can do more.

32:53.590 --> 32:56.548
These kids, they deserve better
than what we're offering.

32:56.640 --> 33:00.098
-Well, our per-student spending, it's--
-Save the talking points.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.838
You pay that fucker, Coach Rick,
two times more than you pay any counselor.

33:06.020 --> 33:06.839
I made a mistake.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.140
A terrible, tragic mistake.

33:10.570 --> 33:13.892
[sighs] And maybe
I wasn't trained well enough

33:13.990 --> 33:15.696
for the job that I was asked to do.

33:16.570 --> 33:18.197
Maybe I didn't fit in here either.

33:19.620 --> 33:20.826
Well, I'll take the blame.

33:21.910 --> 33:26.119
-But who's gonna take the blame next time?
-I hope there won't be a next time.

33:26.210 --> 33:29.088
I hope so, too,
but there's always a next time.

33:38.010 --> 33:40.922
These kids, I flagged as most critical.

33:42.060 --> 33:44.927
They need your attention every week,
if not every day.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.607
Or there will be a next time.

34:10.170 --> 34:10.989
[door closes]

34:12.420 --> 34:14.661
[Justin] I held onto my friendship
with Bryce

34:15.630 --> 34:17.928
because I didn't think
I had anything else.

34:21.510 --> 34:23.137
You went a long way for Bryce.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.591
He'd sell you out to save his own ass
in a heartbeat.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.591
-You know that, right?
-Know what I got, Alex?

34:28.690 --> 34:30.976
I got my friends, I got the team.
That's it.

34:31.310 --> 34:34.768
I don't get to be all sad.
Boo-hoo, my friend died.

34:34.860 --> 34:37.738
I'm gonna put a bullet in my head
so the world feels sorry for me.

34:40.530 --> 34:43.522
Jesus, you wave that gun around
like I give a shit. I don't, man.

34:45.160 --> 34:50.245
If I sell out Bryce or lie,
either way, my whole life falls apart.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.410
I got no one else on my side.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.626
I can't run home. That team's my home.

34:56.590 --> 34:59.081
Going to playoffs, winning state,
being an athlete,

34:59.180 --> 35:00.545
that's not about fun for me.

35:00.930 --> 35:01.965
It's about survival.

35:02.550 --> 35:04.211
It's all I got. It's everything.

35:04.930 --> 35:06.670
So you wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

35:07.430 --> 35:11.389
-Where are the pictures?
-Man, I don't know. I don't have them.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.068
-What?
-I said what I did to get out of there.

35:15.570 --> 35:19.028
'Cause you're not gonna shoot me, Alex.
You can't even shoot yourself.

35:19.110 --> 35:20.236
Fuck you!

35:29.620 --> 35:32.327
By the time you get anywhere,
I'll be long gone.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.375
Is he really worth it?

35:37.670 --> 35:40.503
You're the one with the hole in your head.
You tell me.

35:41.470 --> 35:42.425
[car engine starts]

35:47.430 --> 35:49.307
[Justin] I thought Bryce was all I had.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.346
I've texted you, like, 20 times.

35:53.860 --> 35:54.679
Oh.

35:56.270 --> 35:57.430
Missed it, I guess.

36:00.780 --> 36:02.236
[sighs] I just got a warning.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.020
I told them I should get suspended.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.536
That nothing was your fault.

36:12.540 --> 36:13.416
Are you okay?

36:16.210 --> 36:17.029
[Chle sighs]

36:20.210 --> 36:22.178
You feel safe with me, right?

36:24.050 --> 36:25.039
Of course I do.

36:26.430 --> 36:27.465
And you believe me?

36:28.260 --> 36:30.512
-Bryce--
-Do you believe me? Yes or no?

36:32.730 --> 36:33.628
I believe you.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.526
I'm-- I'm a good person.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.309
I know you are.

36:44.450 --> 36:45.269
Do you?

36:46.660 --> 36:50.232
-You really think that?
-Yes. That's why I'm here.

37:04.510 --> 37:05.886
You know I love you, right?

37:08.350 --> 37:09.169
I know.

37:12.680 --> 37:13.840
Tell me you love me.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.390
I do.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.724
I love you.

37:21.190 --> 37:22.020
Good.

37:23.740 --> 37:24.729
[doorbell rings]

37:24.820 --> 37:27.983
[Justin] But real friends
will give you the bad news.

37:30.450 --> 37:34.113
-Okay, don't freak out.
-Don't start that way and I won't.

37:34.790 --> 37:36.860
-Monty doesn't have the pictures.
-What?

37:36.960 --> 37:38.666
And he lied to us and he ditched me.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.286
-And I'm so sorry.
-[Jessica sighs]

37:40.710 --> 37:42.666
I so wanted the pictures to be the answer.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.172
I tried, Jess. I really tried.

37:47.930 --> 37:51.809
I only wanted this to be okay for you
and to never have to think about it again.

37:51.890 --> 37:52.800
I know.

37:52.890 --> 37:54.630
And this is not our place to say.

37:55.020 --> 37:57.557
I get that.
And-- And we shouldn't even be here.

37:58.020 --> 38:00.306
But, look, it's different now.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.106
With those pictures out there somewhere,

38:03.190 --> 38:05.397
all those girls need someone
to stand up for them.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.657
We don't have the pictures,
so we need you.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.158
[Alex] And we get that you're afraid
that people won't believe you

38:12.240 --> 38:14.822
or that they'll come after you,
and that is so fair.

38:15.870 --> 38:19.249
But we just wanted you to know
that we'll stand by you.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.489
We believe you.

38:21.670 --> 38:22.489
All of us.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.883
Six months ago, I told you
I'd burn Hannah's tapes for you,

38:37.980 --> 38:39.299
and you told me not to.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.398
Because you knew
her story needed to be heard.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.526
And so does yours.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.390
And you don't have to be afraid anymore.

38:48.490 --> 38:52.153
And as lonely as it is,
you'll never be alone.

38:54.410 --> 38:56.571
I told him not to say that
because it's cheesy.

38:56.790 --> 38:58.906
-[laughs]
-[Alex] But the point is...

39:00.120 --> 39:02.839
whenever you're ready, we are, too.

39:05.170 --> 39:08.583
IfI do this, everything changes.

39:11.430 --> 39:12.670
Maybe it needs to change.

39:17.270 --> 39:19.591
[Deputy Standall] How could you tell
he was assaulting her?

39:20.440 --> 39:24.513
[Justin] I could tell
because he was standing over her.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.469
-He was just standing over her?
-No.

39:27.230 --> 39:29.061
Well, you gotta be clear about this, son.

39:30.860 --> 39:32.487
He was on top of her, and his...

39:35.700 --> 39:39.363
his penis was out and he was hard.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.069
She wasn't moving.

39:44.750 --> 39:45.739
[Jessica] I, um...

39:47.170 --> 39:48.706
I remember...

39:51.470 --> 39:54.291
seeing him on top of me.

40:00.560 --> 40:05.600
I remember feeling his body crushing me.

40:09.740 --> 40:15.485
I remember him holding me down
and forcing himself on me.

40:21.870 --> 40:23.246
I remember his face.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.910
It was... It was Bryce Walker.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.422
[indistinct police radio chatter]

40:38.350 --> 40:39.260
[door opens]

40:58.120 --> 40:59.189
[door opens]

41:12.380 --> 41:13.460
I'm so proud of you.

41:15.430 --> 41:17.591
[laughs] Thank you.

41:28.190 --> 41:29.475
I never liked you.

41:30.110 --> 41:32.101
-I know.
-And I can never forgive you.

41:32.610 --> 41:33.736
Dad, be nice.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.193
Despite everything,
I thank you for your courage

41:39.370 --> 41:41.281
and wish you children of your own someday

41:42.330 --> 41:45.151
so you'll know what it's like
to wanna save them from the world.

42:21.490 --> 42:25.119
[Justin] The thing we're all
most afraid of is losing our friends,

42:26.120 --> 42:27.326
is being all alone.

42:51.270 --> 42:54.899
[Tony] I couldn't wait for the verdict,
so I came to help you with the store.

42:56.360 --> 42:59.693
You know, I didn't realize that,
ah, these things move.

43:00.280 --> 43:01.690
They flipped over everything.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.907
All the shelves,
the computers in the back.

43:04.580 --> 43:08.653
Still, everything's done
and pretty much back in place.

43:18.050 --> 43:18.869
Olivia.

43:26.930 --> 43:28.670
I wonder how long it's been back there.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.401
[sighs] It still smells like her.

43:54.380 --> 43:57.122
The jury's gonna do the right thing.
I know they will.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.757
-[suspenseful music plays]
-[man] No! No!

44:02.970 --> 44:04.961
Not you! [whimpers]

44:05.470 --> 44:07.381
Not my beloved bride!

44:08.680 --> 44:11.137
[woman groans] I'm sorry!

44:11.940 --> 44:14.181
-[fi|m continues indistinctly]
-This is a zombie movie.

44:16.020 --> 44:16.850
Yes.

44:19.530 --> 44:21.020
You hate zombie movies.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.229
[clicks tongue] Yes.

44:24.660 --> 44:27.697
But I couldn't just sit around
waiting for the jury to come back.

44:27.790 --> 44:34.070
And it was this, or a romantic comedy,
or a cancer movie, or something French,

44:34.630 --> 44:35.449
SO...

44:36.840 --> 44:39.377
We used to judge people
who came to the movies alone.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.211
Well, I'm not alone, am I?

44:50.970 --> 44:53.347
I think zombies
just really wanna be loved.

44:55.560 --> 44:56.515
That's ridiculous.

44:57.900 --> 45:00.221
Zombies wanna eat brains. That's it.

45:00.400 --> 45:05.269
Period. No deeper meaning,
no metaphor for human existence, nothing.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.271
Except the dead come back to life.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.400
[chuckles]

45:20.750 --> 45:22.206
I can't forgive you, Hannah.

45:25.340 --> 45:26.466
I can't ever forgive you.

45:38.900 --> 45:42.358
I was just gonna walk away,
so you didn't have to.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.351
What made you think
I was gonna walk away?

45:45.320 --> 45:47.026
-Don't you think you should?
-No.

45:49.370 --> 45:52.487
I mean, the man was in a coma. For days.

45:54.660 --> 45:56.036
[clicks tongue] I know.

45:56.920 --> 45:59.832
When I saw him the other night,
I panicked and ran away.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.508
[both sigh]

46:06.130 --> 46:07.256
I'm done running.

46:10.890 --> 46:13.302
And if you're gonna know me,
then you need to know all of me.

46:13.390 --> 46:14.379
Yeah. Well, thank you.

46:16.980 --> 46:18.015
[Tony sighs]

46:21.110 --> 46:22.429
My dad got me into boxing.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.857
And I was a fighter
long before I figured out I was gay.

46:30.030 --> 46:32.407
After I figured out I was gay,
I was glad I was a boxer.

46:34.040 --> 46:34.859
I hear that.

46:37.540 --> 46:40.919
And I was glad I was past the point that
my dad could scare the shit out of me.

46:43.460 --> 46:45.121
'Cause I didn't ever_
wanna be scared again.

46:49.300 --> 46:50.927
Especially of someone that I love.

46:55.060 --> 46:56.880
[cell phone buzzing]

46:57.560 --> 46:58.549
It's a backup date?

47:03.650 --> 47:06.642
It's the verdict. I gotta go.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.536
[spoon tapping]

47:29.090 --> 47:30.216
[cell phone dings]

47:36.220 --> 47:37.096
[bailiff] All rise.

47:41.940 --> 47:44.010
The Honorable Judge Martin Campbell
presiding.

47:44.110 --> 47:46.180
[door opens, closes]

47:50.700 --> 47:51.519
Be seated.

47:56.990 --> 47:58.571
Bailiff, bring in the jury, please.

48:01.620 --> 48:02.746
[door opens]

48:30.150 --> 48:32.061
Madam Forewoman,
have you reached a verdict?

48:32.820 --> 48:33.730
We have, Your Honor.

48:33.820 --> 48:35.811
[indistinct whispering]

49:01.980 --> 49:03.015
[judge] What say you?

49:06.940 --> 49:09.818
[forewoman] We the jury, in the case
of Andrew and Olivia Baker

49:09.900 --> 49:12.391
versus the Evergreen County
School District,

49:14.400 --> 49:16.482
find the defendant not responsible.

49:16.570 --> 49:19.232
[people murmuring]

49:21.580 --> 49:23.491
-[gavel pounding]
-[judge] Come to order.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.871
Thank you, litigators,
and thank you, jury,

49:28.960 --> 49:33.545
for your patience, deliberation,
and service during this proceeding.

49:34.010 --> 49:36.001
-This court is adjourned.
-[gavel pounds]

49:36.090 --> 49:38.092
[chatter]

49:52.280 --> 49:54.646
My daughter wasn't the perfect victim.

49:56.740 --> 49:57.900
There's no such thing.

49:58.660 --> 50:02.039
-[camera shutters clicking]
-Hannah was a beautiful young woman.

50:03.250 --> 50:09.325
Full of life, and dreams, and passions,
and fears, and failings

50:09.420 --> 50:10.910
like any other teenage girl.

50:13.670 --> 50:14.659
And we let her down.

50:17.840 --> 50:22.846
And people wanna point to the parents,
but we didn't allow her to be bullied,

50:22.930 --> 50:26.718
and we didn't send her away
when she came and asked for help,

50:26.810 --> 50:30.644
and we didn't send her back to class
with her rapist.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.487
Boys bullied her and adults allowed it.

50:39.030 --> 50:40.019
You know, I don't know...

50:41.320 --> 50:47.361
a single woman who hasn't faced
sexual assault, abuse, or worse.

50:48.580 --> 50:49.410
Not one.

50:53.130 --> 50:54.199
Many survive.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.547
My daughter didn't,
and that's not her fault.

51:00.180 --> 51:02.671
Obviously, we are very disappointed
with today's verdict.

51:03.430 --> 51:05.170
We presented a case that we believe in.

51:06.520 --> 51:10.342
But despite today's outcome, we hope
we've sent a message to all schools

51:11.610 --> 51:13.430
-that they must do better...
-[door opens]

51:13.820 --> 51:15.469
...and that this cannot happen again.

51:15.820 --> 51:18.732
-Students deserve to feel safe.
-[Clay] Fucking Bryce.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.849
[Dennis] We hope in the near future...

51:21.240 --> 51:22.525
-Bryce Walker?
-Yes, sir?

51:22.620 --> 51:24.485
You're under arrest
for felony sexual assault.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.497
-Excuse me--
-No. You can see him at the station.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.917
-Clear a path, please.
-[deputy 1] Clear a path.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.321
[deputy 2] Let's go, folks.
We need to get through.

51:32.880 --> 51:34.871
You're making a big fucking mistake.

51:36.170 --> 51:37.956
-Justin Foley, you're under arrest...
-What?

51:38.050 --> 51:39.870
...as an accessory
to felony sexual assault.

51:39.970 --> 51:41.085
Clay, what's going on?

51:41.180 --> 51:42.135
Justin...

51:43.760 --> 51:44.715
Mom? Mom?

51:45.220 --> 51:46.130
Justin! Wait, no.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.306
-Jess, it's okay.
-What?

51:48.680 --> 51:49.510
It's okay.

51:50.020 --> 51:52.432
[Justin] Friendship is about sacrifice.

51:52.520 --> 51:55.227
-Mom, they-they arrested Justin.
-I know, honey.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.238
Justin knew that was a risk,
going on record about what happened.

51:58.320 --> 52:01.141
Mom, he-- He saved my life.

52:01.820 --> 52:03.230
All right? We have to help him.

52:03.450 --> 52:04.269
We will.

52:04.910 --> 52:05.729
I promise.

52:13.040 --> 52:13.870
Jessica.

52:14.630 --> 52:15.949
We got him. We got Bryce.

52:16.670 --> 52:17.955
But they got Justin, too.

52:20.050 --> 52:21.711
What do we do? [sobs]

52:24.090 --> 52:25.045
You keep fighting.

52:26.930 --> 52:28.761
["What Went Down" plays]

52:29.020 --> 52:32.592
I buried my heart
In a hole in the ground

52:34.520 --> 52:38.308
With the lights and the roses
And the cowards downtown

52:40.190 --> 52:44.024
They threw me a party
There was no one around

52:45.820 --> 52:51.952
They tried to call my girl
But she could not be found

52:59.000 --> 53:00.877

53:03.090 --> 53:06.969
With the rust and the vultures
And the trash downtown

53:08.470 --> 53:12.634
So don't step to me, kid
You'll never be found

53:14.440 --> 53:20.561
'Cause while you were sleeping
I took over your town

53:39.380 --> 53:42.543
When I see a man, I see a liar

53:42.710 --> 53:45.838
When I see a man, I see a liar

53:45.930 --> 53:49.138
You're the apple of my eye
Of my eye, of my eye

53:49.390 --> 53:52.382
You're the apple of my eye
Of my eye, I want ya

53:52.470 --> 53:55.303
Give up my money
Give up my name, take it away

53:55.600 --> 53:58.933
I'll give it away
I'll give it away, I'll give it

53:59.020 --> 54:01.978
When I see a man, I see a liar

54:02.320 --> 54:05.858
When I see a man, I see a liar

54:30.890 --> 54:33.927
When I see a man, I see a liar

54:34.100 --> 54:37.092
When I see a man, I see a liar

54:37.440 --> 54:41.012
I'm a sympathetic animal
I'm a sympathetic fool

54:41.440 --> 54:43.351
I'm a sympathetic fool, I know

54:43.900 --> 54:47.063
Break up the chain
I'll break up the chain, I'll break it

54:47.450 --> 54:50.362
Give it away
I'll give it away, I'll give it

54:50.450 --> 54:53.362
You're the apple of my eye
Of my eye, of my eye

54:53.700 --> 54:56.908
You're the apple of my eye
Of my eye, I want ya

54:57.000 --> 54:59.958
Give up my money
Give up my name, take it away

55:00.040 --> 55:03.419
I'll give it away
I'll give it away, I'll give it

55:03.500 --> 55:06.663
When I feel low
When I feel low, I feel it

When I see a man, I see a liar

You're the apple of my eye
Of my eye, of my eye

You're the apple of my eye
I want ya

[man] Well done, Ed. Well done.
