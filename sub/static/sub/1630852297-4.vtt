― Yes! A king! Is my name?

― I don't know.
― King what?

30:21.440 --> 30:25.200
― You've never told me your name.
― Not know. Never heard.

― No, they don't.
― Throw stones, beat me. Everywhere!

30:49.160 --> 30:53.120
Peasants are ignorant people.
They do not read, like you and I.

30:53.240 --> 30:56.640
It's an instinct to protect the home,
the family.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.360
Perhaps they are frightened of you.

― No. Hate me.

― And me, look what I found!

31:31.560 --> 31:35.400
It's all chopped, ready for the fire. It
was lying there at the top of the field.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.040
These were left by the stove.
The hare's already gutted.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.680
― Not a mark on the birds.
― How were they caught, then?

31:40.800 --> 31:43.800
It's a mystery. Who's doing this, Felix?

31:43.920 --> 31:46.440
― Someone wants to help us...
― But who?

31:46.560 --> 31:49.360
Who would do that? We're strangers here.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.720
― Because I am poor.
― Why?

36:25.840 --> 36:28.720
Because an army came by

46:13.400 --> 46:16.920
Everyone has friends, William.
You must be my friend.

46:17.040 --> 46:20.040
I have to find my father!
Let me go! Let me go!

46:21.400 --> 46:24.920
I will release you,

46:25.040 --> 46:29.400
― if you answer my question.
― What is it?

46:29.520 --> 46:33.200
I seek a man called Frankenstein.

46:33.320 --> 46:35.280
Have you heard of him?

46:35.400 --> 46:37.360
That's my name!

46:41.800 --> 46:43.800
You?

46:43.920 --> 46:46.000
Frankenstein?

46:46.120 --> 46:49.160
(SCREAMS) You're ugly!
Leave me alone!

46:49.280 --> 46:54.200
― Victor Frankenstein? He is your father?
― No! Victor's my brother!

46:54.320 --> 46:56.840
― Where is he?
― He's at home. He's always at home.

46:56.960 --> 46:59.320
― Can I see him?
― No, of course you can't!

47:01.560 --> 47:04.600
We must be friends, William.
Everyone has friends.

47:04.720 --> 47:11.000
We will go climbing in those mountains
after you take me to see Victor.

47:11.120 --> 47:16.480
― No! You're revolting!
― What is he? What does he do?

47:16.600 --> 47:22.000
― He's a scholar, a genius!
― Was he ever in Ingolstadt?

47:22.120 --> 47:25.040
Yes, he studied there.
He's come home to marry Elizabeth.

47:25.160 --> 47:28.960
But he's silly, he never leaves his room.
He's missing everything!

47:30.440 --> 47:33.080
You will bring him to me.

47:34.200 --> 47:36.160
― Come.
― No! I shan't!

47:36.280 --> 47:40.320
(SCREAMS) My father's a magistrate!
He'll punish you for this!

47:40.440 --> 47:43.200
― You'll go to prison! Help!
― Quiet, boy!

47:44.160 --> 47:48.720
VOICES CALLING: William!
William! William!

47:50.680 --> 47:54.320
MAN: This is where you were playing?
WOMAN: Yes, we were hiding.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.240
― He was coming to find us.
― Where were you hiding?

47:57.360 --> 47:59.200
― Down at the boat-house.
― You didn't see anything?

47:59.320 --> 48:01.200
― No, nothing.
― Heard nothing?

48:01.320 --> 48:04.440
He was calling out.
I thought it was part of the game!

48:04.560 --> 48:06.480
William! William!

48:07.280 --> 48:09.600
Divide into teams!
You and you, come with me!

48:09.720 --> 48:12.240
They are looking,
everyone is looking, you may go home.

48:12.360 --> 48:15.080
― William's missing! How long has it been?
― Since this afternoon.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.600
― But you may go home.
― I've a duty to help, Father.

48:17.720 --> 48:20.640
Victor, it doesn't help anybody
when you become agitated.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.960
He's my brother!
You let me join the search! I must!

48:23.080 --> 48:26.160
SERVANT: Over here!
Monsieur Frankenstein, look at this!

48:26.280 --> 48:28.440
― It's William's hat.
― What was he doing here?

48:28.560 --> 48:32.640
― We were playing hide-and-seek.
― And you didn't keep him in view?

48:32.760 --> 48:35.680
I was hiding from him.
How could I keep him in view?

48:35.800 --> 48:38.360
― But where were you?
― Well, where were you?

48:38.480 --> 48:39.880
Locked in your study, I suppose?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.280
William was not my responsibility.
He was yours!

48:42.400 --> 48:44.760
You have responsibility for what,
exactly?

48:44.880 --> 48:48.280
Enough!
The villagers are saying... Clarice?

48:50.320 --> 48:53.960
They say they've seen a beast
in the mountains, sir.

48:54.080 --> 48:57.560
VICTOR: A beast? What kind of a beast?
SERVANT: A monster. Tall as a pine tree!

48:57.680 --> 49:01.840
― They say it breathes blue fire!
― And they think this thing took William?

49:01.960 --> 49:06.000
― Someone took him! He can't be found.
― No one knows what's up those mountains.

49:06.120 --> 49:08.240
CLARICE: I know what's up those mountains.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.960
Snow and ice.
And a bit more snow and ice. That's all!

49:12.080 --> 49:14.520
Spread out!
Keep looking! He may be nearby.

49:14.640 --> 49:16.840
SERVANTS: William! William! Willy!

49:18.120 --> 49:20.680
What do they mean, a monster?

49:20.800 --> 49:23.080
They've seen some sort of animal,
presumably.

49:23.200 --> 49:26.080
They didn't say an animal.
They said a monster, a creature.

49:26.200 --> 49:28.480
― Folk tales!
― Who exactly saw it?

49:28.600 --> 49:30.840
I don't know! Does it matter?

49:31.760 --> 49:34.680
Victor, you don't look well.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.640
I haven't seen you for weeks.
You're always in your room.

49:37.760 --> 49:42.200
― Why do you need to see me?
― We're supposed to be getting married!

49:42.320 --> 49:44.480
Oh.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

49:44.600 --> 49:49.000
― So I'm expected to...
― Talk to me occasionally, yes!

49:49.120 --> 49:52.680
What if I haven't got anything to say?
What am I meant to do then?

49:52.800 --> 49:55.560
SERVANTS: Monsieur! Come and see!
On the lake!

49:55.680 --> 49:58.200
― What is it?
― An open boat!

49:58.320 --> 50:00.800
― See, it's drifting against the current!
― That's impossible!

50:00.920 --> 50:02.760
― Against the wind!
― Is someone pulling it?

50:02.880 --> 50:05.160
― No, no one!
― Is there anyone aboard?

50:05.280 --> 50:07.120
Haul it in!

50:07.920 --> 50:09.160
Hurry!

50:11.040 --> 50:12.160
William!

50:12.280 --> 50:15.560
CLARICE: Is it the child?
ELIZABETH: Oh, please, no!

50:19.360 --> 50:22.360
VICTOR: He's dead, Father.

50:24.360 --> 50:28.960
M. FRANKENSTEIN: Is it him?
CLARICE: Angels in heaven! Little William!

50:29.080 --> 50:31.720
Have mercy on his soul!

50:31.840 --> 50:34.800
M. FRANKENSTEIN: My boy.
Let me see him.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.480
Carry him.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.280
Sound the bell.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.520
My son is dead.

51:00.320 --> 51:02.320
What are those papers?

51:06.360 --> 51:09.440
Victor, it looks like your hand.

51:10.600 --> 51:15.120
These are diagrams, equations. University
work! What are they doing here?

51:15.240 --> 51:18.320
― It seems they're pages from my journal.
― Well, where is your journal?

51:18.440 --> 51:20.360
I don't know.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.040
I lost it!

51:24.040 --> 51:26.840
― I don't know where it is!
― Victor!

51:26.960 --> 51:29.560

51:34.520 --> 51:37.800
(♪ LABORIOUS POUNDING)

52:06.480 --> 52:08.600
(WIND HOWLS)

52:08.720 --> 52:11.520
Are you here?

52:11.640 --> 52:13.520
Where are you?

52:15.760 --> 52:17.800
Are you here?

52:18.680 --> 52:20.600
Where are you?

52:23.360 --> 52:26.720
You show yourself, you monstrous thing!

52:38.640 --> 52:40.640
VICTOR: (LAUGHING) My God!

52:43.520 --> 52:46.440
Muscular co-ordination ― hand and eye.

52:47.920 --> 52:49.880
Perfect balance!

52:51.000 --> 52:54.800
Excellent tissue,
and the sutures have held!

52:58.240 --> 53:03.760
I failed to make it handsome,
but I gave it strength and grace.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.600
What an achievement!

53:07.720 --> 53:10.440
Unsurpassed in scientific endeavour!

53:10.560 --> 53:13.360
My God, the madness of that night!

53:13.480 --> 53:15.600
The heat, the sweat, the infusions!

53:16.640 --> 53:18.920
The moment I saw it crawl towards me,
and I...

53:19.040 --> 53:21.400
― You ran away.
― What?

53:21.520 --> 53:25.600
You...abandoned me.

53:25.720 --> 53:29.040
― It speaks!
― Yes, Frankenstein.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.760
― It speaks!
― You know my name?

53:34.280 --> 53:37.240
― My journal!
― Why did you abandon me?

53:38.560 --> 53:44.440
― I was terrified. What had I done?
― Built a man and given him life!

53:44.560 --> 53:46.840
― Well, now I have come to take it away.
― Have you?

53:46.960 --> 53:52.200
― I have come to kill you!
― To kill me? Then why did you create me?

53:52.320 --> 53:54.600
To prove that I could.

53:54.720 --> 53:59.520
― So you make sport with my life?
― In the cause of science!

53:59.640 --> 54:05.400
You are my greatest experiment,
but an experiment that has gone wrong.

54:06.800 --> 54:10.240
An experiment that must be curtailed!

54:17.320 --> 54:20.400
Be still, genius!
(VICTOR GROANS)

54:20.520 --> 54:23.920
― I have a request.
― Damn you, you can't have requests!

54:24.040 --> 54:27.440
Oh, I can!
Listen to me, it is your duty!

54:27.560 --> 54:32.400
― I've no duty to a murderer!
― If I am a murderer, you made me one!

54:32.520 --> 54:34.840
You killed my brother! You did it, not me!

54:36.560 --> 54:39.080
I curse the day you drew breath.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.280
Since then I've lived in darkness.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.520
"Is this the Region,
this the Soil, the Clime,

54:44.640 --> 54:47.120
"Said then the lost Archangel.

54:47.240 --> 54:51.640
"This the seat
that we must change for Heav'n,

54:51.760 --> 54:56.320
"This mournful gloom
for that celestial light?"

54:59.920 --> 55:02.000
That's "Paradise Lost"!

55:03.480 --> 55:05.800
You've read "Paradise Lost"?

55:06.800 --> 55:09.640
― I liked it.
― Why?

55:09.760 --> 55:12.040
You saw yourself as Adam?

55:12.160 --> 55:15.960
I should be Adam.
God was proud of Adam.

55:17.040 --> 55:20.720
But Satan is the one I sympathise with.

55:21.560 --> 55:26.120
For like Satan, I was driven out,
though I did no wrong.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.160
And when I see others content,

55:29.280 --> 55:34.400
I feel the bile rise in my throat,

55:34.520 --> 55:39.160
and it tastes like Satan's bile!

55:39.280 --> 55:42.360
This is remarkable!
You are educated and you have memory!

55:42.480 --> 55:45.720
Yes, I use it to remember
being hunted like a rat,

55:45.840 --> 55:49.960
running from human places,
finding refuge in the woods.

55:50.080 --> 55:54.400
I use it to remember being beaten
and whipped.

55:54.520 --> 55:59.080
And I was good.

56:00.120 --> 56:03.960
― I wanted to be good!
― Then why did you kill William?

56:04.080 --> 56:09.080
I wished to see you, and you came.
Would you have come otherwise?

56:09.200 --> 56:13.520
If I had killed half of Ingolstadt,
would you have come?

56:16.440 --> 56:18.320
Did no one show you kindness?

56:20.120 --> 56:23.160
There was an old man,
he taught me many things

56:23.280 --> 56:26.240
but he was blind, he never saw my face.

56:26.360 --> 56:29.000
He did not know that I looked like this!

56:29.960 --> 56:34.920
After a year had gone by, after he had
described to me the seasons,

56:35.040 --> 56:38.640
and I'd watched them
go round ― one-two-three-four ―

56:38.760 --> 56:42.920
when I was one year old,
he said they would take me in,

56:43.040 --> 56:47.480
the son and his wife, beautiful wife.

56:47.600 --> 56:52.440
― What happened?
― You know what happened.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.120
― Oh, God, I do!
― I...

56:55.240 --> 56:59.040
burned them in a fire.

56:59.160 --> 57:04.240
― I'm sorry, I...
― Sorry? You are sorry?

57:04.360 --> 57:06.720
You caused this!

57:06.840 --> 57:11.360
This is your universe, Frankenstein!

57:16.560 --> 57:18.600
Here is my request.

57:18.720 --> 57:26.080
I wish to be part of society, but no
human being will associate with me.

57:26.200 --> 57:32.240
But one of my own kind,
one just as deformed and horrible,

57:32.360 --> 57:36.000
― she would understand, she would...
― What?

57:36.120 --> 57:39.520
― I want a female built like me.
― A female?

57:39.640 --> 57:42.640
You did this.
You alone have the power to...

57:42.760 --> 57:45.240
To create another monster, another brute?

57:45.360 --> 57:47.640
― No, I will not.
― It is my right!

57:47.760 --> 57:50.680
You have no rights! You are a slave!

57:52.520 --> 57:55.800
You want me to build you a female,
so the pair of you can be wicked together.

57:55.920 --> 57:59.440
No, I will not! Torture me
as much as you like, I'll never consent!

58:07.960 --> 58:10.320
I will not torture you.

58:10.440 --> 58:14.000
I will reason with you.
Isn't that what we are supposed to do?

58:14.120 --> 58:17.600
― Have a dialogue?
― There is no dialogue with killers.

58:17.720 --> 58:20.120
Yet you'd kill me if you could!
Why, you have just tried!

58:20.240 --> 58:23.120
Why is your killing justified
and mine is not?

58:23.240 --> 58:27.600
I won't argue with you! My God, I'm
halfway up a mountain, debating with a...

58:27.720 --> 58:30.200
― A living creature!
― A nothing!

58:30.320 --> 58:32.640
A filthy mass of nothing!

58:33.800 --> 58:36.800
I am your master.
You should show respect!

58:36.920 --> 58:39.160
A master has duties.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.880
You left me to die!

58:44.240 --> 58:47.760
I am not a slave. I am free!

58:50.720 --> 58:56.040
If you deny my request
I will make you my enemy.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.600
I will work at your destruction.

59:01.920 --> 59:05.360
I will dedicate myself.

59:05.480 --> 59:12.120
I will not rest
until I desolate your heart!

59:18.560 --> 59:20.560
I apologise.

59:20.680 --> 59:23.120
I... I did intend to reason.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.440
I am capable of logic.

59:29.600 --> 59:33.360
I do not think what I ask is immoderate.

59:35.520 --> 59:40.160
A creature of another sex,
but as hideous as me.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.920
If you consent,
we will disappear together.

59:43.040 --> 59:46.640
We will go to the wilds of South America.

59:46.760 --> 59:53.640
We will build our little paradise
and live there in peace.

59:53.760 --> 59:57.440
And no human being will see us again.
What do you say?

59:57.560 --> 1:00:00.280
I am amazed you have learnt
so much, so fast!

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:02.680
Are you proud of me?

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:05.360
― Proud? No.
― Why not?

1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:08.360
― Because your logic is flawed.
― Is it? Is it?

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:10.480
You say you'll go abroad and disappear,

1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:13.640
yet you also say
you yearn to be accepted by society.

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:16.760
But won't you grow tired of exile?

1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:19.240
Won't you return, and try once more
to live amongst people,

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:23.320
only to meet with their detestation ―
because that is what you will meet with?

1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:27.000
Only now, when you run wild, there will be
two of you and double the destruction.

1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:31.920
― Why should I facilitate this?
― Because I am lonely!

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:36.440
Every creature has a mate.

1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:38.960
Every bird in the sky!

1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:42.560
Even you are to be married!

1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:46.600
Why would you deny me the comforts
you allow yourself?

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:49.520
A moment ago you were amazed
at my intellect,

1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:52.320
but now you harden your heart.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:55.120
Please, do not be inconsistent.

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:58.400
I find it infuriating.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:07.120
All I ask is the possibility of love.

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.200
― Love?
― Yes.

1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:11.400
― You think it is a possibility for you?
― Yes!

1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:14.160
― A good man deserves it!
― Are you a good man?

1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:16.520
I would be! Oh, I would be!

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:19.040
I regret that you are lonely.

1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:21.760
― I did not foresee...
― That I might have feelings?

1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:24.240
You were an equation!

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:27.200
A theorem. I confess it!
A puzzle to be solved.

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:36.480
But if you are sentient
and you will depart...

1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:42.480
Frankenstein, if you build me
a companion, I will quit Europe for ever.

1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:47.000
I will vanish into air. There will be
no more destruction. I will be gone.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:50.760
― Will you swear to be peaceful?
― Yes! I beg you to believe me!

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:53.200
If you gave me your word
that you would leave here for ever,

1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:57.080
and never return ― never!
If you swear, and swear solemnly....

1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:59.320
I swear by the blue sky,

1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:04.800
by the white snow, by the fire of love
that burns in my heart,

1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:09.320
that if you grant my request
you will never have to look on me again

1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:13.320
for as long as the world turns around!

1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:16.240
― You think it turns round?
― Yes, of course.

(CREATURE LAUGHS)

1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:24.960
You must understand, the work is hard.

1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:27.680
You alone can do it.
You alone have the skill.

1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:31.600
I alone, in the whole world,
and no one to share the secret!

1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:40.640
Look, down there. Do you see them?
Little men, with their little lives.

1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:43.600
― Little houses! Little men!
― I am different.

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:46.480
You, you are a king!
The King of Science!

1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:49.920
Build me a woman.
Please! I beg you! A bride.

1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:52.960
A bride should be beautiful.

1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:55.120
She should have pretty eyes, shining hair.

1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:58.040
She should not be hideous,
she should be as lovely as possible.

1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:00.640
― Oh, yes!
― I will not repeat my mistakes.

1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:02.720
We can only go forward,
we can never go back.

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:05.600
Master, work your magic once more.
I beg you!

1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:07.880
A female, I haven't even considered
the question.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.040
There are differences of anatomy,
of course, but also differences of what?

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:14.800
― Of temperament? Humour? Skill?
― I don't know!

1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.960
― What are females good at?
― I don't know!

1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:19.200
My God, what a challenge!

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:22.160
If I could build something immaculate,
something I could exhibit.

1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:26.280
Not a demon, but a goddess!

1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:28.480
Goddess!

1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:33.480
If she was indistinguishable.
If she was...perfect!

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:37.760
Imagine that!

1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:43.200
I may be damned,

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:45.440
but I'll attempt it.

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:52.640
― You will comply with my request?
― I will comply with your request.

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:56.880
If you give me your word
that afterward you will leave us be.

1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.840
I will! If you give me your word
that you will do it!

1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:11.720
What is that for?

1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.360
― You shake it.
― I shake it?

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:18.080
We seal the bargain. Take my hand.

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.440
Thank you! Thank you!
My dream's come true!

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:43.000
― Go home and begin your work at once!
― Home? I can't do it at home!

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.640
― Why not? What happens at home?
― Do this work in my father's house? No!

1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:48.800
Then go where you need to.

1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:51.800

The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away.

VICTOR: Out.

1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:00.720
― Victor! Where have you been?
― In the mountains, on the sea of ice.

1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:03.240
This is a house of death.
It is no time to go adventuring!

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:06.120
Father, I have to make a long journey.
I leave today.

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:07.640
Today?

1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:10.600
― But what about William?
― He isn't coming.

1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:15.400
― I must travel to England. Goodbye.
― England? Why?

1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:18.760
― Work.
― For a year I haven't seen you work!

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:20.920
What is this work
for which you must decamp to England?

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.480
― I don't expect you to understand...
― No, I do not understand!

1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:25.560
I do not believe
your studies are so important.

1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:27.720
I order you to remain for the funeral!

1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:29.640
I have no intention of obeying.
I must go.

1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:33.160
― And your wedding?
― It will have to be postponed.

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:35.840
― But Elizabeth...
― Elizabeth will wait.

1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:38.920
I was in Ingolstadt for six years. A
little longer won't make much difference.

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:42.560
Victor, why are you so sad?
When your mother was dying...

1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:46.000
― Please don't bring her into this!
― When your mother was dying,

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:50.200
I gave a promise that I would see you wed
your cousin Elizabeth.

1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:54.960
That was my wife's last wish,
that you might be happily married.

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:58.760
Oh, you were such a brilliant child,
a carefree child,

1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:02.200
alert and inquisitive,
the joy of our days!

1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:06.320
I came to believe you would do
great things and I would be proud of you!

1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:11.480
Instead, we have this sullenness,
this melancholy, this low fog of gloom.

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:16.240
You flout my authority! You do not respect
the codes by which we live!

1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:18.440
If you insist on leaving,
I cannot stop you,

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:20.560
but you may tell
your fiancée yourself.

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:22.600

Your father tells me you are leaving us.

1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:54.640
Why, Victor?
Why must you go to England?

1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:58.440
Because in England they are
at the forefront of electro-chemistry.

1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:01.080
I've heard of real breakthroughs
by vitalists, galvanists.

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:03.240
I must go and see for myself!

1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:06.360
― For that, you'll put off our wedding?
― Yes.

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:10.280
― It's critical for my experiments.
― What are your experiments?

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:13.160
I'd say that they're beyond
a woman's scope.

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:17.280
― Which part might be beyond my scope?
― All of it, actually.

1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:20.880
Are you suggesting
I'm less intelligent than you?

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.360
Yes.

1:08:22.479 --> 1:08:26.319
― I mean less educated.
― Well, that's hardly my fault.

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:29.040
I wasn't allowed to go to school.

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:33.120
But I can learn, Victor.
I could be your assistant.

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:35.800
Hah! What is a Voltaic pile?

1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:39.680
― A Leyden jar? Electric eggs?
― You know perfectly well I don't know.

1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:43.040
― What is a Voltaic pile?
― For storing an electrostatic charge.

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:46.160
― You link several jars in parallel...
― Oh, please, take me with you.

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:49.319
― It sounds so exciting!
― I will go first to Oxford,

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:53.280
spend several months at the university,
there is nothing exciting about that.

1:08:53.399 --> 1:08:55.479
― I don't care! I'll come.
― I'll be in the library all day.

1:08:55.600 --> 1:08:57.719
I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Let me come!

1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:00.080
Subsequently,
I will travel to the islands of Scotland,

1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:02.200
barren rocks in a barren ocean.

1:09:02.319 --> 1:09:05.760
― It is, I am told, an awful place.
― I don't care! We'll be together!

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:09.800
― It's no situation for a woman!
― And do you think this is?

1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:16.160
The world is turning, Victor, and
I'm sitting in Switzerland, watching it!

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:21.000
I know it's picturesque, the mountains,
the lake, but it's so quiet,

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:25.040
it's oppressive and the people are dull.

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.520
I want to go to Paris, Rome, America!

politics, everything!

― I have no interest in music or politics.
― Have you any interest in me?

Elizabeth, you are beautiful.
You will make a...beautiful wife.

Victor, what do you think I am,
a specimen?

1:10:01.719 --> 1:10:03.920
May I ask you something?

1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:08.400
I want to have children.
Do you want to have children?

1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:10.480
― Yes, of course...
― No.

1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:14.320
― Do you want to give me children?
― God willing, yes I do.

1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:17.240
Then show me how you'll give me children.

1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:20.520
Kiss me, Victor.

1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:36.680

I wish I could stay, but I cannot.

The human body.

1:12:46.639 --> 1:12:49.400
To progress my research,
I require certain materials.

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:54.800
It's an unorthodox discipline and somewhat
disapproved of in academic circles.

1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:58.120
But you have my word
that it is for the public good.

Oh, I don't like the sound o' that!

Quiet, Rab!
We don't move in academic circles.

1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:10.520
Go on, sir. It's illegal, I take it?

1:13:10.639 --> 1:13:13.600
We are a long way from any court of law.

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:17.520
A good-lookin' lass, she was.
Rab liked her.

1:14:17.639 --> 1:14:19.880
― I did not. I liked her sister!
― You did!

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.320
She was beautiful?

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.559
― No' bad.
― Good.

1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:27.240
Are you prepared
to work to my exact specifications?

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:29.639
― Well, Rab, he can't read...
― I can read!

1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:32.120
― Do him a drawing.
― Uncle Ewan...

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:37.040

EWAN: What is it?

1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:59.760
― I don't know, it's a girl!
― Och! Come on, laddie, push!

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.840
She's in!

1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:07.200
You have strange taste, Rab,
that's all I can say.

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:11.360
― I find her terrible skinny.
― I said the sister.

1:15:11.480 --> 1:15:15.719
― The sister's fatter. Uncle Ewan?
― Aye.

1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:19.440
― What's he going to do?
― I don't know.

1:15:19.559 --> 1:15:22.760
This is no' right, Uncle Ewan.

1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:26.120
As the man said, they're dead,
they're no' coming back.

1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:28.080

― Aye.

EWAN: Oh, Jesus!

1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:36.120
― Aye, sir.
― Haul it to the boat.

1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:39.320
― This is only the first, Ewan.
― Is it, sir?

1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:42.120
I shall need a regular supply
of internal organs.

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.160

RAB: Organs?

1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:54.200
Quiet, Rab. Meat for the dogs.

Nothing you're no' familiar wi'.

1:15:57.480 --> 1:15:59.440

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:16.160
Is this how I was formed?

1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:22.440
Stolen at night from wet soil?

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:26.559
Made out of meat for the dogs?

1:16:29.639 --> 1:16:32.760
Even I can feel disgust!

1:16:35.559 --> 1:16:39.680
And will he fashion me beauty
from this filth?

1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:46.280
And will I want her, stinking of death?

But my work is nearly done!

1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:03.120
And let me tell you...

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:06.000
I think I can say I have excelled.

Farewell to sickness and disease, eh?

(WIND WHISTLES OUTSIDE)

1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:58.120
― William!
― So how do you do it?

1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:02.000
― It's late, you should be in bed.
― How do you bring dead things to life?

1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:05.040
― Is it easy?
― No, it's hard.

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:08.840
― It's some kind of miracle.
― Tell me the secret.

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:11.000
― When did you start?
― At school.

1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:14.440
Did you bring the teachers to life?
That really would be a miracle.

1:19:14.559 --> 1:19:16.840
School was so boring!

1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:23.880
I wanted to find out why things exist,
how things exist,

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:27.000
not absurd divinity and idiotic music.

1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:29.600
The laws of existence!

1:19:29.719 --> 1:19:34.120
So I started to read forbidden books ―
Agrippa, Paracelsus.

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.160
― The alchemists!
― Yes!

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:39.040
They were true men of science.
They mapped the heavens.

1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:41.240
They tracked the course of the stars.

1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:43.760
They classified the air we breathe,
the circulation of our blood.

1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:46.200
All modern medicine comes from them.

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:50.200
I too wished to penetrate nature,
to lay bare her deepest mysteries.

1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:52.320
So I studied mathematics.

1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:54.800
― I experimented with galvanism...
― What's that?

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:57.680
You induce spasms in inanimate flesh
with a current from a chloride battery,

1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:00.639
where a zinc plate's laid on a solution
of ammonium chloride and Ceylon moss.

1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:03.200
― How thrilling!
― And as I watched the current arc

1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:05.960
between bismuth and antimony
I found myself asking,

1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:08.080
where does the principle of life,
the actual spark of life,

1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:10.440
where does it come from?

1:20:10.559 --> 1:20:14.040
― It comes from God.
― Yes, but only from God?

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:17.240
― I don't know.
― Can a man be a god?

1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:20.639
― I don't know!
― Well, I had to find out.

1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:24.200
― So off to the graveyard I went.
― Oh, Victor! Yuk!

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:27.120
I watched flesh rot in the soil,
I watched worms eat eyes,

1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:29.280
maggots chew the tissue of the brain.

1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:31.400
I went to executions and charnel-houses.

1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:35.360
I studied the moment of change from life
to death, the specificity of the moment,

1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:39.480
the annihilation of the spark,
until suddenly, months later,

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:42.120
in a fever of creativity,

1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:47.960
I found that I could identify
and replicate the prime cause of life!

1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:50.040
What is it?

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:52.400
I can't tell you that, Will,
you're only little.

1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:55.920
What are you going to do with it?

1:20:56.880 --> 1:20:58.880
I don't know.

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:03.360
I have travelled
where no man has travelled.

1:21:04.639 --> 1:21:06.920
I wonder how far I can go.

1:21:08.719 --> 1:21:12.320
I can create people, Will!

1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:14.960

― Will they reproduce?
― What?

1:21:30.639 --> 1:21:32.960
Will they have wombs, the females?

1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:35.639
Will they breed?
How quickly will they breed?

1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:38.000
How fast is the cycle?
How many in a litter?

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:40.360
― 50? 100? 1,000?
― William!

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:43.080
And if the children breed
with the children?

1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:45.440
― Will they do your bidding?
― What are you saying?

1:21:45.559 --> 1:21:48.000
You are their king.
Will they do as you tell them?

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.400

like the one who killed me?

― I can't give her to you.
― Why not?

1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:02.480
How do I know what will happen
if I bring her fully to life?

1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:05.639
I didn't know how you'd turn out,
how dangerous you'd be.

― Sir!

to overcome my disgusting origins

1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:16.080
and transform myself
into a rational being,

1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:20.559
she, my wife, will do the same.

― And if she doesn't?
― But she will!

1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:26.680

as De Lacey taught me.

She has no choice. We go to Argentina!

1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:35.600

made before she was even created?

1:24:35.719 --> 1:24:37.880
Come on! Use your brain!

1:24:39.559 --> 1:24:43.719
She might reject you.
She might abhor the sight of you!

1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:46.240
She might take one look at you and run.

1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:49.920
She might say she prefers
to live with a man, not a monster!

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:53.600
― Stop talking! You are cruel!
― Look at her! Look!

1:24:53.719 --> 1:24:58.280
Exquisitely constructed, don't you agree?
Look at those cheeks, those lips!

1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:03.400
Look at those breasts!
Who would not desire those breasts?

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:07.160
What if she leaves you?
What if she finds someone else?

1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:11.040
How will you feel if you are rejected
by one of your own species,

1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:13.360
the only one of your own species,

1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:15.840
the only one you can take to your bed,
how will you react?

1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:19.920
― I will run mad if she leaves me!
― It's a risk, then, isn't it?

1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:22.480
No, because I will show her
such adoration,

1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:25.160
such devotion,
she will never want to leave!

1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:28.040

― You must! You must!

― Are you saying you will protect her?
― Yes! I will be there!

― Nobody will harm her.
― Are you saying you will love her?

― Yes, I will!
― Love is not something one can learn.

― I must!

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:17.040
It feels like all the life is bubbling up
and spilling from my mouth.

I will dress her in lace and velvet.

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:44.040
I will give her silk and pearls.

1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:50.719
I will walk in the garden

― Father...?
― What in God's name is this place?

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:36.040
― Father, you came.
― Victor, you were gone too long.

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:38.320
― We were worried!
― You don't know what I've done.

1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:41.600
― No matter what, boy, come home.
― I must be married at once.

1:29:41.719 --> 1:29:46.200
― I must marry Elizabeth at once. At once!
― Please, help me get him to the boat.

1:29:48.639 --> 1:29:52.880
Take this. Destroy it! I want you
to promise me that it will be destroyed!

1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:55.240
― Your journal?
― Destroy it, burn it!

1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:58.559
You give me your word as a magistrate.
No one must read it again.

1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:01.200
Give me your word
that it will be destroyed.

1:30:01.320 --> 1:30:03.360
I give you my word. Come home.

1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:10.320
What has he been doing here?
You, man, speak!

1:30:10.440 --> 1:30:14.080
Medical research, sir ― as he said!

1:30:17.559 --> 1:30:19.920
Medical research?

1:30:21.559 --> 1:30:23.960
Holy Christ.

Listen!

You can still hear the bells ringing
over the water.

1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:13.680
― So you can.
― Many congratulations, mistress.

1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:16.440
― It was a splendid day.
― Thank you.

1:31:16.559 --> 1:31:18.960
― Will you please get me ready for bed?
― Yes, mistress.

1:31:19.080 --> 1:31:21.520
― I want to look beautiful.
― Yes, mistress.

1:31:21.639 --> 1:31:24.880
― Perhaps then he'll...
― I'm sure he will.

1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:28.639
He never touches me, Clarice.

1:31:29.559 --> 1:31:34.080
He never comes near.
He barely spoke to me after the service.

1:31:34.200 --> 1:31:37.800
Well, he has always been peculiar.

1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:43.600
― What have I done wrong?
― You've done nothing, mistress.

1:31:43.719 --> 1:31:48.480
Men, you know! They're as nervous
as we are on their wedding night.

1:31:48.600 --> 1:31:51.280
A lot of them have no experience whatever.

1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:55.040
― I'm not nervous.
― I know you're not, mistress.

1:31:55.160 --> 1:31:58.719
And yet you don't know
what to expect, do you?

1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:00.920
None of us do, first time.

1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:03.440
It can come as quite a shock.

1:32:03.559 --> 1:32:08.280
So just remember, there's no shame
in keeping your eyes shut.

1:32:09.559 --> 1:32:13.400

to be perfectly honest.

1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:16.320
Oh, but I'm sure you will.

Here we are, mistress.
You'll look as pretty as a picture.

― Where is he?
― He'll be along shortly, mistress.

Wait and see.
Having a glass or two, probably,

1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.840
if he's anything like my husband.

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:35.480

― We patrolled the roof and the terrace.
― We have men down at the lake.

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.000
Good, wait for me outside.
I'll join you presently.

1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:04.920
― Victor, what is going on?
― The house is secure.

1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:08.719
― There are guards at every door.
― Why? What is going on? Tell me.

1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:11.559
― I should have told you before.
― Yes, I think you should!

1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:13.360
It...

1:33:13.480 --> 1:33:16.120
It is one of my experiments, Elizabeth.

1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:19.719
You will find this hard to credit,
and there is little time to explain but...

1:33:19.840 --> 1:33:23.520
the simple fact is...I built a man.

1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:27.760
― You did what?
― I built a man.

1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:31.680
― And succeeded in animating him.
― Say that again?

1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:33.240
I built a man!

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:35.920
"Animating him"?

1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:38.719
― Do you mean bringing him to life?
― Yes, bringing him to life.

1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:42.440
― My creature, I brought him to life!
― Your creature?

1:33:42.559 --> 1:33:45.360
― You don't believe me.
― Yes.

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:47.520
Yes, I do.

1:33:47.639 --> 1:33:50.840
If you say you have made a creature
and brought him to life,

1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:53.559
then I do believe you, of course.

1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:56.880
― What is it, like a puppet?
― No, a functioning man!

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.920
― A brute of a man!
― Well, this is ridiculous.

1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:02.800
You are telling me that you have made
some sort of creature,

1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:06.600
with your electric eggs, presumably,
and it ― what? It does what?

1:34:06.719 --> 1:34:10.120
― It pursues me.
― Victor, you have been very ill.

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:12.440
In Scotland you had a nervous collapse.

1:34:12.559 --> 1:34:15.360
Look, there is a thing out there
and it means to destroy me!

1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:19.920
I have lured it here and now I must act.
I must kill him before he kills me!

1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:23.680
― What do you mean you have lured it here?
― I knew he would come for...

1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:29.040
― For the...the...
― The... The wedding?

1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:33.920
Did you send him an invitation?
(GASPS) Victor, he wasn't on the list(!)

1:34:34.040 --> 1:34:36.280
Elizabeth ― this is serious!

1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:38.240
Please believe me!

1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:45.440
You are asking me to believe that
you have created some sort of monster?

1:34:45.559 --> 1:34:47.440
― Yes.
― Why?

1:34:47.559 --> 1:34:49.639
I beg your pardon?

1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:53.120
Why? Why did you do that?

1:34:56.120 --> 1:34:58.320
Because I had a vision.

1:34:59.559 --> 1:35:02.440
A vision of perfection.

1:35:04.719 --> 1:35:10.600
I followed Nature into her lair,
and I stripped her of her secrets.

1:35:10.719 --> 1:35:12.600
I did it, Elizabeth.

1:35:12.719 --> 1:35:17.280
I have brought torrents of light
into a darkening world.

1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:19.520
I did it, Elizabeth, I did it!

1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:23.400
I have never doubted your brilliance.

1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:26.360
I have beaten death!

1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:30.400
I have done it!
I've made a living thing!

1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:33.800
― But if you wanted to create life...
― Yes, that's it.

1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:38.120
― That's exactly what I wanted.
― Then why not just give me a child?

1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:40.719
― We could have married years ago!
― No, that's not...

1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:44.680
Because that is how
we create life, Victor.

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:47.840
― That is the usual way.
― I am talking about science!

1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:49.480
No.

1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:52.280
You are talking about pride.

1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:56.360
You've been trying God's work.

1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.200
Is that what you're telling me?
And it has gone awry.

1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:06.400
In you I found...paradise.

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.600
But the apple is eaten.

1:36:11.719 --> 1:36:13.719
We cannot go back.

1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:17.040
You've meddled with the natural order

1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:23.320
and led us into chaos, because you worship
the gods of electricity and gas!

1:36:24.559 --> 1:36:26.559
What is wrong with you men?

1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:29.719
There are guards all around the house.

1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:33.240
I will kill this thing that I foolishly
made and then I will come back to you.

1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:37.600
― Please, don't go! Hold me, please!
― There's time for that when this is done.

1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:43.280
I do love you, Elizabeth.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:21.719
But he didn't mention what I looked like,
did he?

1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:28.280
Are you curious, Elizabeth?

1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:36.280
Don't scream.

1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:38.760
I will release you.

1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:49.080
Turn around. Look at me.

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.080
(SHE GASPS)

1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:08.040
I need your help.

1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:10.120
I have a grievance.

1:38:11.559 --> 1:38:13.600
Victor did this?

1:38:13.719 --> 1:38:16.160
Do you think he is clever?

1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:19.920
― A genius!
― Yes, that is right!

1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:25.960
― What is your name?
― My name?

1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:29.920
Ha! What luxury that would be!

1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:32.200
He didn't give me one.

1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:36.680
Touch.

1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:48.680
What do you feel, Elizabeth?

1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:51.760
― Heat.
― And here?

1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:55.880
A heartbeat.

1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000
Just like yours.

1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:02.800
Now if you please,

1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:04.719
we'll have none of that!

1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:11.200
― You say you have a grievance?
― Madame!

1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:17.400
Your husband is a good man,
but he does not keep his word.

1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:23.680
If you had a child and it looked like me,
would you abandon it?

1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:26.880
― I'd never abandon a child.
― Are you quite sure?

1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.600
― I'm sure.
― No matter how repulsive?

1:39:29.719 --> 1:39:31.639
― I am sure!
― Well, he did!

1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:36.719
He left me because I look like this,
because I am different.

1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:40.800
If Victor has treated you poorly,
I shall speak to him.

1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:43.760
― You may count on that.
― Isn't he coming to your bed?

1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:46.400
He must learn to take responsibility
for his actions...

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.760
Surely he desires you
on your wedding night?

1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:52.760
..and that we must always
stand up for the disadvantaged.

1:39:52.880 --> 1:39:55.719
Absolutely!
Give voice to the oppressed.

1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:58.040
Will you put my case?

1:39:58.160 --> 1:39:59.960
What is it you want?

1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:07.520
I did not ask to be born,
but once born, I will fight to live.

1:40:07.639 --> 1:40:10.600
All life is precious ― even mine.

1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:15.080
He promised to give me
the one thing I lack,

1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:18.240
the one thing I need to be content.

1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:24.320
But then he broke his word.

1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:31.040
I... I... I want a friend. That is all.

1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.080
I'll be your friend.

1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:37.080
If you'll let me.

1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:38.719
Will you?

1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:42.080
If you need help,
then let's see what we can do.

1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:44.120
Sit with me!

1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:48.480
I will not hurt you, I promise.

1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:52.680
I am educated.

1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:56.400
I know right from wrong.

1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:15.440
Incredible.

1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:19.920
You are quite extraordinary.

1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:22.639
― Me?
― Yes, you.

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:27.400
Perhaps I am a genius, too?

1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:31.120
(LAUGHS FONDLY)
Perhaps you are.

1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:33.120
What are you good at?

1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:38.760
I am good at the art of assimilation.

1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:42.440
I have watched and listened and learned.

1:41:42.559 --> 1:41:47.520
At first, I knew nothing,
but I studied the ways of men

1:41:47.639 --> 1:41:52.719
and slowly I learnt how to ruin...

1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:56.960
..how to hate,

1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:00.600
how to debase,

1:42:00.719 --> 1:42:03.600
how to humiliate.

1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:08.559
And at the feet of my master,
I learnt the highest of human skills,

1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:12.000
the skill no other creature owns.

1:42:13.639 --> 1:42:16.920
I finally learnt how to lie.

1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:20.000
Lie?

1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:24.000
Tonight I have met someone perfect.

1:42:25.559 --> 1:42:28.240
Thank you for trying to understand.

1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:31.240
But he broke his word,

1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:35.520
so I break mine.
