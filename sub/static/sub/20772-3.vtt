00:00.929 --> 00:02.492
Previously on "Casual"...

00:02.523 --> 00:04.486
- Hey. So, um, I talked to Dad.
- Mm-hmm.

00:04.487 --> 00:08.031
And he said he'd pay
for half of my tattoo removal

00:08.032 --> 00:09.366
if you paid for the other half.

00:09.367 --> 00:10.408
Really?

00:10.409 --> 00:11.993
I just think that's something

00:11.994 --> 00:13.954
that you should have talked
to me about first.

00:13.955 --> 00:16.164
Why would you lie to me
about the tattoo?

00:16.165 --> 00:17.332
Because I'm a teenager.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.625
If you want it removed,

00:18.626 --> 00:21.002
you can earn the money yourself.

00:21.003 --> 00:22.170
All of it.

00:22.171 --> 00:23.338
Fine.

00:23.339 --> 00:25.507
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:25.508 --> 00:26.925
Whatever you want.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.176
It's your dad.

00:28.177 --> 00:29.970
Let's do a night out in Burbank.

00:29.971 --> 00:31.304
This is where we came from.

00:31.305 --> 00:32.889
This is the land of our roots,

00:32.890 --> 00:34.766
so let's see it one last time

00:34.767 --> 00:36.351
and spread his ashes and be free.

00:36.352 --> 00:40.355
Dad, you were less than perfect,

00:40.356 --> 00:41.982
but you were there.

00:41.983 --> 00:44.109
I don't hate you,

00:44.110 --> 00:46.278
and I hope you find your peace.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.362
It was unkind,

00:47.363 --> 00:49.155
what you did to Valerie.

00:49.156 --> 00:50.532
I don't know if you're lonely.

00:50.533 --> 00:51.825
I assume you must be.

00:51.826 --> 00:53.702
But telling her about some secret father

00:53.703 --> 00:55.203
isn't gonna bring her back to you.

00:55.204 --> 00:57.664
Not just a father.

00:57.665 --> 00:59.207
A brother too.

00:59.208 --> 01:02.336
A half brother just like you.

01:30.072 --> 01:31.865
What is normal, anyway?

01:31.866 --> 01:33.617
Right? Whose standard are we using?

01:33.618 --> 01:34.951
I feel normal.

01:34.952 --> 01:35.911
Normal enough.

01:35.912 --> 01:37.412
I mean, 60 years ago,

01:37.413 --> 01:40.415
we gave "abnormal" people shock therapy,

01:40.416 --> 01:41.541
and now we hold parades with them.

01:41.542 --> 01:42.917
Wonderful, colorful parades

01:42.918 --> 01:44.961
full of happiness and joy,
and who's to say

01:44.962 --> 01:47.672
some day they won't throw
a parade for me?

01:47.673 --> 01:48.882
Do you want a parade?

01:48.883 --> 01:50.342
Of course not. Nobody would show up.

01:50.343 --> 01:53.094
I'm just saying, it's a continuum.

01:53.095 --> 01:54.721
It's a sliding scale.

01:54.722 --> 01:56.973
And you're happy with where
you're at on that scale.

01:56.974 --> 01:58.391
Yeah, I feel good.

01:58.392 --> 02:00.435
I mean, that's not to say
that I'm fixed.

02:00.436 --> 02:01.770
That would imply that I was broken,

02:01.771 --> 02:03.646
and I'm definitely not broken.

02:03.647 --> 02:04.898
I just feel ready.

02:04.899 --> 02:06.066
You're ready.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.525
Yeah, to move forward. To move on.

02:07.526 --> 02:09.360
To... move forward.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.029
To move on? To move on.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.739
To move forward.

02:12.740 --> 02:15.408
Right. Um, okay.

02:15.409 --> 02:16.951
You just killed your father.

02:16.952 --> 02:19.496
You found out that your sister's
your half sister

02:19.497 --> 02:21.206
and that she has another half brother.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.124
Mm, yeah, I'm not sure how I feel

02:23.125 --> 02:24.292
about using the word "kill."

02:24.293 --> 02:25.669
It's more like I was

02:25.670 --> 02:27.462
death's assistant, hmm?

02:27.463 --> 02:29.547
His right-hand man.

02:30.716 --> 02:32.718
Look, I'm fine.

02:33.803 --> 02:34.969
I've got a pitch lined up.

02:34.970 --> 02:38.306
Leon and I are getting ribs later.

02:38.307 --> 02:39.641
I feel good.

02:39.723 --> 02:41.809
I feel really, really good.

02:43.396 --> 02:44.396
Okay.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.272
Well, if you change your mind,

02:46.273 --> 02:47.941
door's always open.

02:47.942 --> 02:50.735
Hey, maybe you and I
should get ribs sometime.

02:50.736 --> 02:53.029
I'll bill you for our sessions.

02:54.949 --> 02:56.325
Cool.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.663
Yes, no, I hear you, and I'm coming in

03:01.664 --> 03:02.914
right now, Lacey,

03:02.915 --> 03:04.958
and we can talk all about it, okay?

03:05.960 --> 03:07.419
It's open.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.462
No, that wasn't to you.

03:09.463 --> 03:11.798
Uh, but I'll be there soon, okay?

03:11.799 --> 03:13.300
Bye.

03:14.510 --> 03:16.302
Oh, Leon, you're a lifesaver.

03:16.303 --> 03:18.847
You're an absolute fucking lifesaver.

03:18.848 --> 03:20.265
Okay, watch your head.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.517
The movers are gonna be here
between 10:00 and 12:00,

03:22.518 --> 03:23.893
but who knows?

03:23.894 --> 03:26.187
They also said I'd have a table
two weeks ago.

03:26.188 --> 03:27.480
Are you sure this is okay?

03:27.481 --> 03:29.315
Y-yes. No, you're doing me a favor.

03:29.316 --> 03:31.359
They're doing construction
outside my apartment.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.236
Oh, that's great.
Okay, good. You're welcome.

03:33.237 --> 03:34.988
I... I think the table's gonna really

03:34.989 --> 03:36.906
bring the room together, don't you?

03:36.907 --> 03:38.533
I mean, I'm using this, um,

03:38.534 --> 03:41.369
sustainably harvested wood,
all reclaimed.

03:41.370 --> 03:43.580
I'm not entirely sure
what it means, but...

03:43.581 --> 03:45.165
it feels good to help.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.541
That sounds lovely.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.585
Um, maybe you could text me some photos

03:48.586 --> 03:50.295
when it's in?

03:50.296 --> 03:51.463
I'll be sure to.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.298
A couple perspectives. Maybe three.

03:53.299 --> 03:54.924
You don't have to go out to the patio.

03:54.925 --> 03:57.177
Uh, is, um, Laura around?

03:57.178 --> 03:58.595
Actually, no.

03:58.596 --> 04:00.847
- She's at work.
- Oh.

04:00.848 --> 04:02.265
All right, have the best time.

04:02.266 --> 04:03.225
Thank you, Leon.

04:03.226 --> 04:04.392
Yeah, no worries.

04:04.393 --> 04:05.602
Bye.

04:06.645 --> 04:07.687
Each week, we'll meet here,

04:07.688 --> 04:08.688
and you'll be driven

04:08.689 --> 04:10.064
to high foot traffic locations.

04:10.065 --> 04:11.399
Home Depots are popular.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.318
Best Buy.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.776
I'm a Ralphs guy myself.

04:13.777 --> 04:15.028
Shifts are eight hours,

04:15.029 --> 04:16.571
and you'll be given one or two

04:16.572 --> 04:18.113
different ballot initiatives.

04:18.115 --> 04:20.283
Big Sooners fan?

04:20.284 --> 04:21.243
What?

04:21.244 --> 04:23.870
Was there a question?

04:23.871 --> 04:24.913
Uh, yeah.

04:24.914 --> 04:27.499
Um, compensation-wise,

04:27.500 --> 04:28.750
what are we looking at?

04:28.751 --> 04:29.918
You know, 'cause the Craigslist ad

04:29.919 --> 04:32.045
said up to two grand a week.

04:32.046 --> 04:33.505
That's certainly possible.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.340
All right, 'cause I...
I have a monetary goal

04:35.341 --> 04:36.674
that I'm kind of working toward.

04:36.675 --> 04:39.135
It's, uh, 65 a signature.

04:39.136 --> 04:40.345
Dollars?

04:40.346 --> 04:41.346
Cents.

04:41.347 --> 04:42.347
These are ballot props,

04:42.348 --> 04:44.265
not credit card applications.

04:48.103 --> 04:50.605
Did it come?

04:50.606 --> 04:51.856
No, not yet.

04:51.857 --> 04:54.234
Ugh, delivery people are the worst.

04:54.235 --> 04:57.237
- Just the snooty ones.
- Well, true.

04:57.238 --> 04:59.197
The family-run ones
with the illegal immigrants

04:59.198 --> 05:01.115
who are just trying to make
a life for themselves

05:01.116 --> 05:02.659
but are too afraid to step out in public

05:02.660 --> 05:05.370
for fear of deportation are great.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.038
My brother-in-law was a delivery guy,

05:07.039 --> 05:10.250
and he used to just pee
on the floor for no reason.

05:10.251 --> 05:11.293
That's, uh...

05:12.336 --> 05:14.295
- That's awful.
- Yeah, it was.

05:14.296 --> 05:16.339
But he was just a raging alcoholic

05:16.340 --> 05:19.259
whose liver basically exploded
at a Cracker Barrel.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.802
- Jesus.
- I know.

05:20.803 --> 05:23.097
Cracker Barrels are also the worst.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.226
Where are Tom and Lacey?

05:28.227 --> 05:30.436
Oh, they're running late.

05:34.191 --> 05:36.693
It's like "The Hunger Games" out there.

05:36.694 --> 05:38.820
Only no one looks like Liam Hemsworth.

05:39.947 --> 05:42.365
Maybe Luke Hemsworth.

05:42.366 --> 05:44.534
There's no such thing
as a "Luke Hemsworth."

05:44.535 --> 05:45.994
I mean, what happened to all the jobs

05:45.995 --> 05:47.662
that were promised to my generation?

05:47.663 --> 05:49.163
That's the generation before yours.

05:49.164 --> 05:51.666
The only thing you get is blame
for national apathy.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.876
Ugh.

05:52.877 --> 05:54.335
Hey, if you're really that desperate,

05:54.336 --> 05:57.046
donate your body to medical research.

05:57.047 --> 05:59.674
I guess I could sell my eggs.

05:59.675 --> 06:01.384
They're fresh as they'll ever be.

06:01.385 --> 06:04.679
I'm telling you, those studies
kept me afloat before Snooger.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.223
Here, I found this
in literally eight seconds.

06:07.224 --> 06:08.933
"Wanted, sexually active teens

06:08.934 --> 06:10.643
between 15 and 19."

06:10.644 --> 06:12.353
$1,500 a pop.

06:12.354 --> 06:13.396
Shit, really?

06:13.397 --> 06:14.856
Yep. Come on, I'll drive you.

06:14.857 --> 06:16.900
Least I can do for your generation.

06:40.049 --> 06:41.341
I mean, it's obvious.

06:41.342 --> 06:42.383
It's not obvious,

06:42.384 --> 06:43.718
because it's not true.

06:43.719 --> 06:45.803
He got a Samsung. Who gets a Samsung?

06:45.804 --> 06:48.348
61 million people
in the U. S., to be exact.

06:48.349 --> 06:50.475
He's only doing this so none
of our technology syncs,

06:50.476 --> 06:53.227
and his pervy little messages
don't pop up on my iPad.

06:53.228 --> 06:55.313
I simply prefer the Android
operating system.

06:55.314 --> 06:56.689
To cheat with.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.108
The phone is customizable,
it's waterproof,

06:59.109 --> 07:00.568
and I can use whatever apps I want.

07:00.569 --> 07:02.195
They explode in your fucking hands.

07:02.196 --> 07:04.280
- That's an urban myth.
- Okay, take it on a plane.

07:04.281 --> 07:05.698
You'll end up on a terrorist watch list.

07:05.699 --> 07:08.348
That's a completely different model. It...

07:08.911 --> 07:10.453
Will you please tell her

07:10.454 --> 07:12.247
that I didn't cheat?

07:14.083 --> 07:15.333
- Lacey...
- Wait.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.918
Are you taking his side?

07:16.919 --> 07:18.044
Um, I... I haven't...

07:18.045 --> 07:19.379
I haven't said anything yet.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.797
Okay, can I just say one thing

07:20.798 --> 07:22.757
that I realized in the middle
of cardio barre

07:22.758 --> 07:24.759
about how seriously fucked up
and pathological

07:24.760 --> 07:26.428
this whole situation is?

07:27.471 --> 07:28.513
Uh, yeah. Of course.

07:28.514 --> 07:29.890
Go ahead.

07:32.101 --> 07:33.768
Now I fucking forgot.

07:39.441 --> 07:41.693
It's 100% "La Kwaw."

07:41.694 --> 07:43.611
Everyone at Boingo said "La Croy."

07:43.612 --> 07:44.862
Like, everybody.

07:44.863 --> 07:46.656
Okay, it means "the cross" in French,

07:46.657 --> 07:48.991
so we should pronounce it
the way the French intended.

07:48.992 --> 07:50.785
Uh, except this is America,

07:50.786 --> 07:52.328
and it's an American company.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.664
Irrelevant.

07:54.665 --> 07:55.748
Can I help you?

07:55.749 --> 07:56.709
Yeah, Alex Cole.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.710
Here to see Brent and Ryan.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.001
I live in "Los Feeliz."

07:59.002 --> 08:00.795
We don't pronounce it "Los Feleez."

08:00.796 --> 08:03.047
Right, 'cause we're racist
against Mexicans

08:03.048 --> 08:05.049
and trying to subvert their language.

08:05.050 --> 08:07.301
Sorry, who are you here to see again?

08:07.302 --> 08:08.344
Brent and Ryan.

08:08.345 --> 08:09.637
Well, that's ridiculous.

08:09.638 --> 08:10.972
What about St. Croix?

08:10.973 --> 08:12.807
We don't pronounce it "St. Kwaw."

08:12.808 --> 08:14.684
- Excuse me.
- You can just take a seat.

08:14.685 --> 08:16.644
Uh, can I get you some water?

08:16.645 --> 08:17.979
Maybe a "La Kwaw"?

08:17.980 --> 08:19.981
We've got lemon, lime, pamplemousse...

08:19.982 --> 08:21.650
I'm fine.

08:27.281 --> 08:29.490
First time, huh?

08:30.452 --> 08:32.034
That obvious?

08:32.034 --> 08:33.910
My 11th.

08:33.912 --> 08:35.663
Wow.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.331
A real lab rat.

08:37.332 --> 08:39.500
They'll pay you
for all kinds of shit here.

08:39.501 --> 08:42.712
My favorite ones usually
involve weed or porn,

08:42.712 --> 08:44.964
but they pay the least.

08:44.965 --> 08:49.052
Oh, s... so it's not, like, a flat rate?

08:49.053 --> 08:50.303
It varies.

08:50.304 --> 08:52.305
There's a pelvic organ prolapse one

08:52.306 --> 08:53.890
that pays $2,500,

08:53.891 --> 08:55.516
but I think your vagina would have to be

08:55.517 --> 08:56.977
pretty much falling out.

08:59.605 --> 09:02.482
Is your vagina falling out?

09:02.483 --> 09:03.691
No.

09:03.692 --> 09:05.903
You couldn't do that one, then.

09:33.055 --> 09:36.140
So how about we use the rest of the time

09:36.141 --> 09:38.476
to focus on how
we're gonna move forward?

09:38.477 --> 09:40.228
Easy. He's getting an iPhone.

09:40.229 --> 09:41.854
I already had an iPhone.

09:41.855 --> 09:43.231
It's too hard to type.

09:43.232 --> 09:45.650
Um, I meant on an emotional level,

09:45.651 --> 09:49.278
by reestablishing boundaries and trust.

09:49.279 --> 09:51.072
Also, I hate it on principal.

09:51.073 --> 09:53.658
You know? Have you seen the 7S?

09:53.659 --> 09:54.909
Uh... no.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.577
It's the wireless headphones.

09:56.578 --> 09:59.413
They're a picture-perfect
example of corporate greed.

09:59.414 --> 10:00.998
And there's an environmental issue too.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.251
We are creating mountains
of electronic waste.

10:03.252 --> 10:05.169
You don't even recycle.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.420
Who doesn't recycle?

10:06.421 --> 10:08.965
You know, I think that the iPhone

10:08.966 --> 10:12.677
is a Band-Aid for a larger trust issue.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.263
Tom, you've cheated on Lacey
in the past.

10:15.264 --> 10:18.099
And, Lacey, you've become so sensitive

10:18.100 --> 10:20.268
to any perceived transgression,

10:20.269 --> 10:21.936
and yet you're still together,

10:21.937 --> 10:23.271
and you have been for a while.

10:23.272 --> 10:24.730
How many years has it been?

10:24.731 --> 10:25.773
Four.

10:25.774 --> 10:27.108
Right.

10:27.109 --> 10:31.988
So maybe by trusting him,

10:31.989 --> 10:33.698
you allow him to be the partner

10:33.699 --> 10:36.243
that he wants to be.

10:39.288 --> 10:40.955
Get a 6 or a fucking 5S.

10:40.956 --> 10:43.292
I don't care,
but you're getting an iPhone.

10:46.628 --> 10:49.297
People lie in their profiles
about everything.

10:49.298 --> 10:52.091
Age, weight, how much they drink.

10:52.092 --> 10:53.509
Where they don't lie

10:53.510 --> 10:55.261
is in their actions.

10:55.262 --> 10:56.971
So why not make an algorithm

10:56.972 --> 10:59.891
that utilizes and quantifies
every action you take?

10:59.892 --> 11:02.393
What you order on Amazon,

11:02.394 --> 11:04.312
what you listen to on Spotify,

11:04.313 --> 11:05.521
where you Postmates from,

11:05.522 --> 11:06.981
what porn you look at.

11:06.982 --> 11:09.650
With MetaDater, you get a dating app

11:09.651 --> 11:12.570
that curates true compatibility.

11:12.571 --> 11:13.613
To love someone,

11:13.614 --> 11:14.947
you have to know them.

11:14.948 --> 11:16.824
And that means looking
beyond the persona

11:16.825 --> 11:18.451
they adopt in public.

11:18.452 --> 11:22.288
It means getting hard data
on who they are

11:22.289 --> 11:24.583
and how they act in private.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.501
This is really cool.

11:27.502 --> 11:29.170
Yeah, really impressive.

11:29.171 --> 11:30.504
Doesn't Tinder already do this,

11:30.505 --> 11:32.048
- by liking with Spotify?
- Oh.

11:32.049 --> 11:35.509
Yes, but we'd be using
a whole range of music apps:

11:35.510 --> 11:38.471
iTunes, Tidal, SoundCloud,

11:38.472 --> 11:39.639
Pandora, Shazam.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.182
Mm-hmm. And what about The League?

11:41.183 --> 11:42.725
Is that the one Amanda helped fund?

11:42.726 --> 11:44.060
It syncs with your LinkedIn.

11:44.061 --> 11:45.519
I heard they were doing
an Amazon thing too.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.021
I love her. She's so great.

11:47.022 --> 11:48.731
Oh, I love her too.
She lost all that weight, right?

11:48.732 --> 11:49.774
- She did?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:49.775 --> 11:50.983
In, like, four months.

11:50.984 --> 11:52.693
She was doing two days at the gym.

11:52.694 --> 11:55.196
- She didn't eat a single carb.
- A different person.

11:55.197 --> 11:56.989
- Changed her life.
- Oh, man.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.908
- Um, Alex.
- Yes.

11:58.909 --> 12:00.660
- Mm-hmm?
- Thanks for coming in, man.

12:00.661 --> 12:02.078
Yeah, we'll let you know,

12:02.079 --> 12:03.788
but that was really great.

12:03.789 --> 12:06.123
- So well-told.
- Mm-hmm.

12:37.739 --> 12:38.781
$19.50.

12:39.908 --> 12:41.826
I wasn't even an hour.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.161
You need validation.

12:45.706 --> 12:48.082
- There's a huge difference.
- There is not.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.334
Pellegrino gets all the hype,
but at this point,

12:50.335 --> 12:51.961
it's just trading in on its name.

12:51.962 --> 12:55.673
Hey, I need validation.
Is that possible?

12:55.674 --> 12:57.508
You are a talented guy,

12:57.509 --> 13:00.052
and I'm sure you'll have plenty
of other ideas.

13:00.053 --> 13:01.887
Don't worry, it'll happen.

13:01.888 --> 13:04.849
But no, we don't validate.
It's company policy.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.392
Sorry, man.

13:10.314 --> 13:12.106
Yep.

13:12.107 --> 13:13.274
Yep.

13:16.111 --> 13:17.445
It's $20.65 now.

13:44.097 --> 13:47.016
How many sexual partners have you had?

13:47.017 --> 13:48.267
Six.

13:48.268 --> 13:50.019
Seven?

13:50.020 --> 13:51.812
I've seen some shit.

13:51.813 --> 13:54.356
Okay, and what age were you

13:54.357 --> 13:56.817
when you lost your virginity?

13:56.818 --> 13:58.611
14.

13:58.612 --> 14:01.447
Can you expand on that a little?

14:01.448 --> 14:04.408
He was older, a lot older.

14:04.409 --> 14:06.827
It was, like, salacious at first,

14:06.828 --> 14:10.039
but then it just felt right.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.499
We did everything.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.125
Have you read "Lolita"?

14:13.126 --> 14:14.668
You know you make the same
amount of money

14:14.669 --> 14:16.629
if you tell the truth.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.089
Oh.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.966
So you lost your virginity at 14.

14:20.967 --> 14:22.093
Yep.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.552
But you've been on birth control

14:23.553 --> 14:26.847
since 12?

14:26.848 --> 14:29.183
- Uh-huh.
- Why so early?

14:29.184 --> 14:32.853
Um, my mom wanted to make sure
I was safe.

14:32.854 --> 14:34.730
That I was, uh,

14:34.731 --> 14:36.440
comfortable being physical.

14:36.441 --> 14:39.860
She encouraged you to have sex
as a preteen?

14:39.861 --> 14:42.238
I mean, I wouldn't say that.

14:42.239 --> 14:44.949
Do you talk to her about
your sexual encounters?

14:44.950 --> 14:46.408
Oh, I don't... I don't know how much

14:46.409 --> 14:47.910
she wants to hear about them.

14:47.911 --> 14:49.870
So she put you on the pill

14:49.871 --> 14:51.915
and sent you on your way?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.627
What's this study about, exactly?

15:07.013 --> 15:08.013
How's Dustin?

15:08.014 --> 15:10.349
Justin. He's great.

15:10.350 --> 15:12.643
Mm. What's he, like, five now?

15:12.644 --> 15:13.853
He's eight.

15:13.854 --> 15:16.272
Oh. They grow up so fast.

15:16.273 --> 15:17.481
Mm-hmm.

15:17.482 --> 15:21.026
So, uh, you're currently not working?

15:21.027 --> 15:24.864
I'm dabbling in
the hospitality business.

15:24.865 --> 15:26.031
Airbnb.

15:26.032 --> 15:27.158
In the past 12 months,

15:27.159 --> 15:29.201
your expenses are nearly double.

15:29.202 --> 15:31.829
Yeah, I had to pay
for my father's cremation.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.372
And his wedding.

15:33.373 --> 15:35.583
Not in that order.

15:35.584 --> 15:38.252
Back in March,
you made a $10,000 purchase

15:38.253 --> 15:39.545
at a furniture boutique?

15:39.546 --> 15:41.840
Mm-hmm, chairs. They're gone now.

15:43.216 --> 15:46.635
How attached are you to your home?

15:46.636 --> 15:47.970
Very.

15:47.971 --> 15:49.138
Mount Olympus McMansions

15:49.139 --> 15:50.973
are encroaching on the whole canyon.

15:50.974 --> 15:53.058
My house is a safeguard against G-Wagons

15:53.059 --> 15:55.853
and decorative lion statues.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.271
If I put you on a budget,

15:57.272 --> 16:01.358
your savings can get you through
the end of the year.

16:01.359 --> 16:03.068
Maybe.

16:03.069 --> 16:04.653
Let's itemize.

16:04.654 --> 16:07.948
Last month, you spent $85

16:07.949 --> 16:09.825
on music streaming services.

16:09.826 --> 16:12.286
"Lemonade" was a Tidal exclusive.

16:12.287 --> 16:14.538
And Taylor Swift is only on Apple Music.

16:14.539 --> 16:16.832
$270 on Lyft.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.001
I'm contributing to the service economy.

16:19.002 --> 16:21.462
$1,200 on Postmates.

16:21.463 --> 16:24.840
It's for groceries too.

16:24.841 --> 16:25.925
Drive yourself,

16:25.926 --> 16:27.009
shop yourself,

16:27.010 --> 16:28.427
and cook for yourself.

16:28.428 --> 16:29.678
And get a job.

16:29.679 --> 16:32.473
And I want you to delete the apps.

16:32.474 --> 16:35.517
Less temptation.

16:35.518 --> 16:37.228
You're a monster.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.562
You'll get used to it.

16:39.523 --> 16:42.858
Like a phantom limb.

16:42.859 --> 16:44.985
Okay.

16:44.986 --> 16:46.737
Do you know,
according to California law,

16:46.738 --> 16:48.489
I could take you
to the small claims court

16:48.490 --> 16:50.699
and sue you for damages incurred

16:50.700 --> 16:51.992
by waiting.

16:53.453 --> 16:55.788
No, no, no, I'm a composer.

17:00.001 --> 17:01.710
Two weeks. Yep.

17:01.711 --> 17:03.003
And not a day longer.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.383
Thank you.

17:07.884 --> 17:09.510
So we were about 16, 17,

17:09.511 --> 17:11.053
in her parents' basement, you know?

17:11.054 --> 17:13.681
I thought she had rented
"The Princess Bride,"

17:13.682 --> 17:15.015
but it was "The Prince of Tides."

17:15.016 --> 17:16.849
You've seen it, right?

17:16.851 --> 17:18.227
- Hmm?
- Mmm, No?

17:18.228 --> 17:19.395
Oh, you'd love it.

17:19.396 --> 17:21.689
Barbra Streisand plays a therapist...

17:21.690 --> 17:22.731
who wears this, like, pink,

17:22.732 --> 17:24.108
like, off-the-shoulder sweater,

17:24.108 --> 17:25.233
you know the kind I mean?

17:25.234 --> 17:26.527
Her name was Lowenstein.

17:26.528 --> 17:28.696
And the movie has a lot
of butt rape and stuff,

17:28.697 --> 17:30.948
but it really stuck with me.

17:30.949 --> 17:32.283
Oh, crap.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.285
Mmm. Oh, oh, my God.

17:34.286 --> 17:35.703
- Oh, oh... yep.
- Here, let me just...

17:35.704 --> 17:37.329
- Oh, my gosh. Thank you.
- Oh, here.

17:37.330 --> 17:38.622
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

17:38.623 --> 17:39.583
Mmm, mmm.

17:39.584 --> 17:41.292
So now, ever since then,

17:41.293 --> 17:44.295
whenever I jerk off,
I think "Lowenstein."

17:44.296 --> 17:45.546
"Lowenstein," you know what I mean?

17:45.547 --> 17:46.589
It's, like, sense memory.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.299
The name turns me rock hard.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.093
But it's the name
of my new boss at work...

17:51.094 --> 17:52.219
who's a dude.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.430
It's a real problem. Mmm.

17:54.431 --> 17:56.557
I wish you wouldn't eat
during our session.

17:56.558 --> 17:59.101
Oh, me neither.
I'm just... I'm starving.

17:59.102 --> 18:00.061
Mmm.

18:06.109 --> 18:08.277
Ew, worse than the falafel?

18:08.278 --> 18:10.863
Different, but equally bad.

18:10.864 --> 18:12.406
Oh, hey, I meant to tell you.

18:12.407 --> 18:14.742
I saw a posting...
they're looking for someone

18:14.743 --> 18:17.119
to teach intro to psych
at UCLA Extension.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.787
My God, I would be a terrible teacher.

18:18.788 --> 18:20.205
No, you wouldn't.

18:20.206 --> 18:21.790
I would tell the students

18:21.791 --> 18:23.375
what a thankless fucking job this is,

18:23.376 --> 18:24.918
and not to waste their money
learning about things

18:24.919 --> 18:26.420
that nobody wants to hear about,

18:26.421 --> 18:28.297
even when they're paying you to say 'em.

18:28.298 --> 18:29.923
I mean, that...

18:29.924 --> 18:31.091
You're just so honest.

18:31.092 --> 18:32.968
That's so inspiring.

18:32.969 --> 18:34.721
Leia...

18:36.431 --> 18:38.307
Get your masters in something else

18:38.308 --> 18:40.351
before it's too late,
and the only thing you have

18:40.352 --> 18:42.019
to look forward to in life

18:42.020 --> 18:43.812
is a table.

18:45.357 --> 18:46.274
Uh, but...

18:46.275 --> 18:47.316
Okay.

18:47.317 --> 18:48.442
Have a great weekend.

18:48.443 --> 18:49.568
Well, it's Monday.

18:49.569 --> 18:53.198
Oh, God. See you tomorrow.

19:15.804 --> 19:17.805
Leon.

19:18.932 --> 19:20.140
Uh, hi.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.813
It's, uh, quite a tale.

19:25.814 --> 19:28.399
Uh, you see, your cabinet
was, uh, faulty,

19:28.400 --> 19:30.484
and I was fixing it with a drill,

19:30.485 --> 19:32.986
and it was very loud,

19:32.987 --> 19:36.323
so when they came, I, uh...

19:38.284 --> 19:39.326
I'm sorry.

19:41.121 --> 19:42.871
It's fine.

19:42.872 --> 19:44.998
They'll redeliver in two weeks.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.667
Two weeks?

19:48.878 --> 19:51.922
What's two more weeks?

19:51.923 --> 19:54.007
I, uh...

19:54.008 --> 19:55.802
made risotto.

19:57.804 --> 19:59.305
And, um...

20:01.099 --> 20:03.517
Here.

20:03.518 --> 20:06.270
It's been decanted.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.521
You...

20:07.522 --> 20:09.273
can you excuse me for one sec?

20:09.274 --> 20:10.524
Okay.

20:20.827 --> 20:22.369
How was your pitch?

20:22.370 --> 20:24.371
Terrible.

20:24.372 --> 20:26.915
How was the study?

20:26.916 --> 20:28.417
Invasive.

20:28.418 --> 20:31.044
Overly personal.

20:31.045 --> 20:32.546
They want me back tomorrow.

20:36.092 --> 20:38.552
You hungry?

20:38.553 --> 20:40.387
Yeah, I could eat.

20:40.388 --> 20:41.430
We could get some food,

20:41.431 --> 20:42.723
bring it to your mom.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.563
Do you think my mom's a good mom?

20:52.108 --> 20:53.567
The best.

20:56.446 --> 20:58.655
Yeah.

21:21.137 --> 21:22.304
Can I talk to you?

21:22.305 --> 21:23.640
In private?

21:31.606 --> 21:33.607
Why is Leon on your floor?

21:33.608 --> 21:34.817
Because he made dinner.

21:34.818 --> 21:36.151
Cloth napkins and a checkered blanket?

21:36.152 --> 21:37.319
He made you an indoor picnic.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.779
We were supposed to get ribs later.

21:38.780 --> 21:40.948
Yeah, well, he was waiting for a table.

21:40.949 --> 21:42.491
He fucked up. I'm sorry.

21:42.492 --> 21:44.409
It's weird.
I don't know what to tell you.

21:44.410 --> 21:46.745
Why would you ask
Leon to wait for your table?

21:46.746 --> 21:49.958
Because he's just
helping me out since I moved in.

21:51.626 --> 21:52.626
Oh.

21:52.627 --> 21:55.128
- Alex, no...
- Okay.

21:55.129 --> 21:56.839
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.049
It's nice to have a friend
who's willing to help out.

21:59.050 --> 22:01.468
Stop that. You're being nine years old.

22:01.469 --> 22:02.845
Mm-hmm, pretty soon
you'll have beautiful,

22:02.846 --> 22:04.555
soft-spoken, half British children,

22:04.556 --> 22:05.973
and I'll give a speech at the wedding.

22:05.974 --> 22:07.724
It'll be witty and self-deprecating,

22:07.725 --> 22:09.434
and then you'll honeymoon in Bora Bora

22:09.435 --> 22:10.936
or the south of France
with your new family,

22:10.937 --> 22:12.896
and that'll be that.

22:16.776 --> 22:19.487
I'm sorry. I've had a long fucking day.

22:21.197 --> 22:25.826
I would never honeymoon in Bora Bora.

22:25.827 --> 22:27.120
I know.

22:34.377 --> 22:35.795
Good night, Laura.

22:37.797 --> 22:39.465
Leon.

22:42.343 --> 22:45.263
I should probably just...

22:46.848 --> 22:49.141
Leon, I...

22:49.142 --> 22:50.602
It's okay.

22:53.438 --> 22:54.521
Thank you.

22:54.522 --> 22:55.982
You're welcome.

23:08.411 --> 23:09.870
Ouch.

23:09.871 --> 23:11.705
- Mom?
- I'm fine.

23:11.706 --> 23:13.123
Ow. I'm fine.

23:13.124 --> 23:15.500
It's all fine.

23:15.501 --> 23:19.546
I just wanted you to have
a really nice table.

23:19.547 --> 23:21.173
I don't care about the table.

23:21.174 --> 23:24.635
Okay, fine, I wanted a table, Laura.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.678
And instead I got Samsungs

23:26.679 --> 23:29.640
and meatballs and drills,

23:29.641 --> 23:31.892
and I just wanted to come home,

23:31.893 --> 23:35.145
sit at a table, open up my journal

23:35.146 --> 23:37.940
that the girl from Clover said
is ethical and eco-friendly,

23:37.941 --> 23:40.233
because it's made from the hide of sheep

23:40.234 --> 23:41.443
that died from old age,

23:41.444 --> 23:42.861
and I just wanted to map out

23:42.862 --> 23:45.782
how I was gonna make my life
feel different.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.034
I just want...

23:49.035 --> 23:52.829
I just want things to feel different.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.291
You really need a table for that?

23:57.418 --> 24:00.128
Maybe I don't. I don't know.

24:00.129 --> 24:02.255
Fuck this.

24:02.256 --> 24:04.967
How's the job?

24:04.968 --> 24:07.803
It was confusing.

24:07.804 --> 24:10.974
What's confusing about
getting signatures?

24:12.600 --> 24:14.519
I guess it was just boring.

24:17.438 --> 24:20.023
Sometimes boring's not so bad.

24:44.963 --> 24:47.627
_

25:15.329 --> 25:17.365
You're back.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.740
65¢ a pop, right?

25:23.546 --> 25:25.088
How many girls did you text

25:25.089 --> 25:28.133
to come over last night?

25:28.134 --> 25:29.634
- Four.
- Hmm.

25:29.635 --> 25:32.054
But you're the only one
I wanted to hear from.

25:37.727 --> 25:39.352
Call me a Lyft.

25:43.107 --> 25:44.524
How about I drive you?
