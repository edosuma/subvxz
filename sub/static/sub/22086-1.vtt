02:16.936 --> 02:20.272
Oh, go on, boy.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.874
That's it.

02:21.876 --> 02:24.276
Just keep going.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.278
It's waiting for you.

02:28.415 --> 02:32.951
There's no need to be afraid.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.120
It's just a dream.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.823
Right?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.491
Oh...

02:39.493 --> 02:41.493
Or is it?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.998
Life is...

02:46.000 --> 02:48.267
Just a dream.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.470
Life is just a dream.

04:01.841 --> 04:05.577
So, uh, how often
do you have these dreams?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.446
I don't know.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.448
Well, is it more than...

04:09.450 --> 04:11.116
More than two times?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.384
Yes?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.186
More than five?

04:14.188 --> 04:16.188
Maybe around ten.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.122
Or more.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.457
Ten?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.625
I really don't remember.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.561
So, uh, now you're...

04:22.563 --> 04:24.363
You're afraid of the dark, yes?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.897
Afraid to sleep?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.599
I just don't want
to see them again.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.736
And who are they?

04:30.738 --> 04:32.004
What do they look like?

04:33.340 --> 04:34.673
Girl.

04:34.675 --> 04:35.941
She's in a mask.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.743
Uh-huh.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.611
And the other kid.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.146
His face is all messed up.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.983
But he... he sort of...

04:46.654 --> 04:47.654
Go on.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.589
He sort of looks like me.

04:52.226 --> 04:55.093
So it's... it's you
that you see in the dream?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.630
I don't really know.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.767
I see.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.102
Um...

05:04.104 --> 05:06.438
What do you think
he wants from you?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.773
This other?

05:07.775 --> 05:10.642
To hurt me, I guess.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.379
To take my place.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.416
To replace you?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.386
I see.

05:21.388 --> 05:24.089
But it's... it's gotten
to the point where, uh,

05:24.091 --> 05:27.292
just the idea of going to sleep

05:27.294 --> 05:29.094
is making him sick.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.229
He'll do anything
to avoid sleep.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.497
Yeah.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.199
I imagine it would be.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.300
Hmm.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.137
Look, Zach.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.342
What you're going through
is, um...

05:44.411 --> 05:46.211
Is really scary.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.213
No?

05:49.216 --> 05:52.751
It must seem
completely real to you,

05:52.753 --> 05:56.621
but, uh, guess what.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.124
It's not.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.928
You're just a very smart,
imaginative young man,

06:02.930 --> 06:06.131
and you're gonna be just fine.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.466
Trust me.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.274
He's just holding on
to some childhood fantasies,

06:16.276 --> 06:18.210
which I'm sure
he'll grow out of.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.278
I do think I should
continue seeing him...

06:38.164 --> 06:39.698
Um...

06:39.700 --> 06:41.566
Just try to relax tonight, okay?

06:42.903 --> 06:46.772
Think of fun, happy thoughts.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.642
I could stay here
all night if you want.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.512
Yeah.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.581
That might be good.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.117
Okay.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.919
Go to sleep.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.381
I'm going to die.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.460
It's not big,
but it's a well-maintained,

08:48.462 --> 08:49.728
cozy, little house.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.929
It's lovely.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.963
I just adore it.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.698
Aw, thank you.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.301
It's where Vince and I lived
after we were married...

08:56.303 --> 08:58.169
Until we bought the house
across the street.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.938
Oh, yeah. Wow.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.473
Yeah.
We were always so happy here.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.241
So we kept it
for friends and family...

09:03.243 --> 09:05.110
You know, a place to stay
when they visited.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.445
Yeah.
About, uh, twice in ten years.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.147
Well, if I were your family,

09:09.149 --> 09:10.482
I'd come stay here all the time.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.083
Aw. That's why we thought

09:12.085 --> 09:13.752
it'd be nice to rent it out
to a young couple

09:13.754 --> 09:15.086
like yourselves.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.622
This place should be enjoyed.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.157
Plus, we'd enjoy the company.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.825
Where do you guys live now?

09:20.827 --> 09:23.328
Well, we actually
don't live together.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.797
This would be
the first time for both of us.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.732
Aww. A little love nest.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.002
What do you, uh...
What do you do?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.505
Uh, Shawn teaches art
to third graders,

09:33.507 --> 09:35.640
and I'm almost done
with law school.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.108
No kidding?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.910
You don't look
like a lawyer, man.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.745
- Vince!
- No, I mean, look at him.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.181
No, it's okay. No, my mom
actually thought the same thing.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.983
She always thought
I'd end up owning a bar.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.252
Ah. I like bars.

09:48.488 --> 09:51.523
Zach, this would be
so great for us.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.725
It's so cozy and warm.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.894
I'd feel safe here.

09:55.896 --> 09:56.995
Okay.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.465
Um...

10:00.467 --> 10:03.868
You guys didn't mention
in the ad the actual rent.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.870
How much is it?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.239
Um, well,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.308
what are you kids
looking to pay?

10:11.578 --> 10:12.811
I mean, we'd struggle to pay

10:12.813 --> 10:14.546
more than, like, 850.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.818
Today is your lucky day.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.953
We figured about seven
and a quarter should cover it.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.421
Is that all right?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.090
That's perfect.
Thank you so much.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.891
- Our pleasure.
- Thank you.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.893
Aw, we are happy
to have you guys.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.314
Oh, my god!

10:50.984 --> 10:53.151
What is wrong with you?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.086
You could scare
the hell out of somebody.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.955
Hmm, what time is it anyway?

10:56.957 --> 11:00.358
Hmm. Time for you to bone up
for your civil procedure exam.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.496
Oh, god,
I was doing that all night.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.131
It's so boring.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.934
Mm, you know,
speaking of boning up.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.936
If you don't get off me
in the next...

11:13.773 --> 11:15.006
That's not sexy.

11:17.943 --> 11:19.477
I'm such an idiot.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.447
Okay. Ugh.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.154
- Hey, Zach!
- Hey.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.889
- Good morning, buddy.
- Good morning.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.291
I thought you had a rule...
No classes before noon.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.226
Ah. No, I got a test today.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.995
I got to hit the library
before it starts.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.830
- Anything I can help you with?
- Oh, yeah?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.732
How are you gonna help him?
What, are you gonna describe

11:40.734 --> 11:42.634
to him what the inside
of a courtroom looks like?

11:42.636 --> 11:43.968
You've been dragged
in one enough times.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.737
That's real cute, Jo.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.405
You're gonna give this kid
a bad impression about me.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.808
- You know that?
- No. Not possible.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.676
Hey, why don't you guys
come over for dinner tonight?

11:51.678 --> 11:53.745
We got some fresh eggplant
from pop's garden.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.213
I'll make some eggplant parm.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.715
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice, Jo.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.483
I, uh... I'll ask Shawn.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.918
You know, I don't know
what she's doing after class,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.419
but, uh, thanks.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.987
I'll, uh...
I'll catch you guys later.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.522
- Okay, good luck.
- Thanks, man.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.424
Cute kids, huh?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.093
It's nice having them around.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.095
Yeah, it is.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.164
No pants! Naked!

12:13.166 --> 12:15.166
He says, you lost a tomato.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.835
That was the craziest thing
I'd ever seen.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.369
And the guy says,

12:18.371 --> 12:20.171
"you got to go.
I'm gonna call the cops."

12:21.708 --> 12:23.374
You know what, man?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.376
Pop started the business
just after six weeks after

12:25.378 --> 12:27.378
he and mom came over
from Palermo.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.647
He barely spoke
a word of English.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.716
Started with a little
produce stand downtown.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.718
By the time he was done,
we owned eight markets

12:33.720 --> 12:34.953
all over the county.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.654
That must've taken real courage.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.623
More worry than courage.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.159
I was always worried
that I'd do good, you know,

12:41.161 --> 12:42.594
so I can support my family.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.763
Of course.
You always did that, pop.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.766
There was always food
on the table.

12:47.768 --> 12:48.767
Thank you, Vincent.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.769
Salut.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.104
How did you two meet?

12:56.543 --> 12:58.309
- What?
- I was down at the Lincoln...

12:58.311 --> 13:00.078
I'm just gonna tell a story,
that's all.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.081
I was down at
our Lincoln street store,

13:03.083 --> 13:04.816
and I noticed
this beautiful woman

13:04.818 --> 13:06.117
squeezing grapefruits.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.519
Oh, wow.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.053
- She was squeezing...
- Vince!

13:09.055 --> 13:11.222
- This is stupid.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.091
- Oh!
- Oh, Vince!

13:13.093 --> 13:14.093
Mmm!

13:16.630 --> 13:17.896
Anyways,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.898
let's just say that I was, um,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.499
extremely...
- Aroused?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.370
- Interested.
- Right.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.238
- I was gonna say interested.
- Okay.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.574
So I waited for her
to do all of her shopping,

13:29.576 --> 13:31.709
and then I made sure
I was at the register.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.378
And she gave me a 20...

13:33.380 --> 13:35.113
I gave her back 30.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.581
And...

13:36.583 --> 13:38.416
She's been costing me
ever since.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.185
Mm-hmm. And worth every penny.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.253
- Right, baby?
- Every penny, baby.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.788
Every penny and more.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.260
This is the best wife that
any man could ever hope for.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.964
I couldn't imagine a wife
more beautiful than Jo.

13:52.966 --> 13:53.966
Mmm!

13:55.435 --> 13:57.335
Ah, okay, come on, guys.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.804
So tell... what is it?
What's your... what's your secret?

13:59.806 --> 14:03.007
Simple. Just never take
the love of a beautiful woman

14:03.009 --> 14:04.442
for granted.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.544
Just don't forget
how lucky you are.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.547
And, Jo?

14:09.549 --> 14:12.283
Well, you get what you give.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.286
So I just make sure
he never wants for anything.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.024
You guys are a beautiful couple.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.359
You belong together.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.294
Aw. How nice.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.068
- I ate so much.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.070
Do you eat enough?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.073
Right or left?

14:46.887 --> 14:50.622
Is there something you'd like
to ask, Mr. Bradford?

14:50.624 --> 14:52.824
Look at you, you're so gorgeous.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.693
Vince was right.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.829
I can't believe
I'm actually living with you.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.835
I still get butterflies
in my stomach...

15:05.071 --> 15:06.351
Every time I'm about to see you.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.240
You do?

15:09.943 --> 15:11.276
Even now we live together?

15:12.612 --> 15:13.811
Do you like your new home?

15:16.149 --> 15:18.149
I'm home anywhere
I can fall into you.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.022
Just want to feel
like this forever.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.790
Good morning, Mr. Marino!

18:48.394 --> 18:50.328
Oh, hi. Hi.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.997
Look at those flowers!

18:52.999 --> 18:55.199
You're a magician.
They're so beautiful.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.701
Ah. Grazie.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.636
Thank you. Thank you, my dear.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.239
Maybe you could teach me
how to garden sometime?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.107
Oh, sure, sure. No problem.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.109
First, you need some time.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.777
And then

19:06.779 --> 19:08.546
you just got to care.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.381
You know? Like your art.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.084
Yeah, well, I haven't managed
to kill a painting... Yet.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.821
By the way,

19:16.823 --> 19:19.123
Jo told me
you just lost your dog.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.493
She was a good girl.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.897
She had a good life.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.401
I didn't want her to suffer.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.405
She just got old.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.843
Like me.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.745
Come on,
you're gonna outlive us all.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.747
You're just pretending
to be an old guy.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.749
Have a good day, Mr. Marino.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.617
All right. Ciao, Bella.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.098
Hey, babe. Guess what.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.633
Um, funny,

20:35.635 --> 20:37.768
I thought this was my call,
but go on.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.304
Well, look, not only did I pass,

20:40.306 --> 20:42.306
I scored in the top 10%.

20:42.308 --> 20:45.009
Think I might finally be getting
a handle on all this crap.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.545
Well, too bad
you're about to graduate.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.513
Ah, yeah. Uh, so what's up?

20:49.515 --> 20:51.849
Well, I just wanted to know
if you wouldn't mind picking up

20:51.851 --> 20:53.284
a bottle of...

20:53.286 --> 20:55.119
Something easy for dinner...

21:02.128 --> 21:03.127
Shit. Shit.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.462
What did you say?

21:04.464 --> 21:06.731
Oh. No, Shawn, not you.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.099
The car behind me.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.901
Well, can you do it?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.370
Do what?

21:14.040 --> 21:15.473
Never mind.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.774
I'll see you
at home later, okay?

21:16.776 --> 21:17.975
Yeah. I'll see you later.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.836
Jesus!

21:45.838 --> 21:47.505
Fuck! What the fuck?

21:58.518 --> 22:00.518
Okay.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.453
- Jesus Christ!

22:03.589 --> 22:04.589
Hey, sweetie.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.925
Hey, uh, here.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.593
Let me... let me get those.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.295
Thanks, hon.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.097
Always a gentleman.

22:13.099 --> 22:16.300
Your folks obviously did
a couple of things right.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.436
But only a couple.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.505
Hey, Shawn, the weirdest thing
just happened with my laptop.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.441
It... it, uh...
It wouldn't turn on,

22:23.443 --> 22:25.376
and then it made these...

22:25.378 --> 22:27.178
These, like, weird sounds,

22:27.180 --> 22:31.115
and then this...
This scarier-than-shit face

22:31.117 --> 22:35.252
pops up and just, like,
screamed at me.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.587
It really startled me.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.924
You seem a little...

22:39.926 --> 22:42.226
Delicate these days. Hmm?

22:42.228 --> 22:43.894
You are still okay

22:43.896 --> 22:45.496
with your decision to live
with a girl, aren't you?

22:45.498 --> 22:47.098
I mean...

22:47.100 --> 22:48.699
I'll be okay if you're not.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.501
Ah, yeah.
You're such a wise ass.

22:52.405 --> 22:55.072
My wise ass is one
of the reasons you love me.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.542
Ow, Shawn!

22:58.544 --> 23:00.044
You see what I mean?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.679
I definitely
have to toughen you up.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.646
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:02.648 --> 23:03.881
Get out of here.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.684
- Go back to work.
- Okay.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.467
Lilly?

24:05.578 --> 24:08.746
Lilly, I don't understand.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.749
Jo.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.084
Hey.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.919
Hey, what's...
What's going on?

24:49.754 --> 24:51.055
It's just pops.

24:52.123 --> 24:53.357
He...

24:53.359 --> 24:55.826
Someone beat him
really, really bad.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.628
My god, are you serious?
That's crazy!

24:57.630 --> 25:00.831
His face is all swollen and...
And bruised and bloody.

25:00.833 --> 25:01.966
What's going on?

25:01.968 --> 25:03.501
He's just an old man.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.969
Jo, why are you crying?

25:04.971 --> 25:06.637
Mr. Marino was mugged
last night.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.506
Beat him pretty bad.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.442
They're gonna keep him
in the hospital a few days.

25:11.444 --> 25:13.844
Jo, what... what can we do?

25:13.846 --> 25:15.145
Just...

25:15.147 --> 25:17.214
You guys just be careful, okay?

25:18.116 --> 25:20.851
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.791
I mean, what kind of animal
just beats an old man

25:27.793 --> 25:29.994
and doesn't take anything?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.463
It really gives me the creeps.

25:32.465 --> 25:34.398
Zach, we moved
to this neighborhood

25:34.400 --> 25:38.602
because it seemed like
a nice, quiet, family area.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.472
I mean, otherwise,
we could've lived in the city.

25:41.474 --> 25:44.141
Hey, um,
maybe you should be careful

25:44.143 --> 25:45.809
walking around at night,

25:45.811 --> 25:47.611
you know,
even just outside the house.

25:47.613 --> 25:50.347
I'm not gonna live scared,
you know? It's just...

25:50.349 --> 25:52.216
- It's no fun.
- Yeah, Shawn, I know.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.418
But it happened once.
It could happen again.

25:56.622 --> 25:59.356
That's a cute picture
of the three of you.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.761
But you do look sort of sad.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.497
Yeah.

26:06.499 --> 26:07.499
Well, I still like it.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.006
That's better.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.384
- Hey, come on in.
- Hey, Vince.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.720
We just wanted to come by
and see how your dad was doing.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.389
It's a curse! Vince, a curse
has come over our home.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.291
We have get out of here
or we're gonna die.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.193
- Jo, that's enough.
- We got to get out of here,

28:49.195 --> 28:50.728
or we're gonna die!
- That's enough. Stop. Stop!

28:50.730 --> 28:52.663
Hey, hey, hey. Please, stop.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.869
Come with me.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.086
Look who's come to see you, pop.

29:19.959 --> 29:20.959
Mr. Marino?

29:33.705 --> 29:35.405
It's gonna be okay.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.509
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be okay.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.516
You have Vincent and Jo.

29:45.518 --> 29:48.018
They're...
They're gonna look after you.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.692
Mr. Marino?

30:03.736 --> 30:06.537
I thought
I told you not to come in here.

30:08.073 --> 30:09.073
It's okay, pop.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.809
It's okay.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.610
You don't know.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.214
I'm so scared.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.090
Oh!

30:27.092 --> 30:28.258
What are you doing, Jo?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.393
You're driving me nuts.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.228
You got to get a grip.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.131
When I was a little girl,

30:34.133 --> 30:35.933
the old men would tell a story

30:35.935 --> 30:39.136
of a fisherman that was made
to join the crusades.

30:42.141 --> 30:45.642
He told his young wife
not to fear

30:45.644 --> 30:48.345
and promised her
that he would return

30:48.347 --> 30:51.148
with a bejeweled crucifix
from Jerusalem.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.484
But when he did return,

30:54.486 --> 30:58.655
he learned that she had been
savagely beaten and raped...

30:58.657 --> 31:01.658
Over and over again
throughout the years.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.527
And when
she had finally lost faith

31:03.529 --> 31:05.596
that he would ever
come back to her...

31:08.400 --> 31:11.602
She decided to end the pain
and took her own life.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.340
Some say he went insane
from the sorrow,

31:16.342 --> 31:18.542
and in his rage,
he became a demon.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.311
Beast.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.715
For hundreds of years,

31:24.717 --> 31:27.251
women and children would
disappear from the countryside.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.721
It was the fisherman.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.055
This is...

31:32.057 --> 31:34.658
It's just a tall tale, Jo.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.593
It's a myth...

31:36.595 --> 31:39.463
That fools from the old country
would use to scare their kids.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.198
It has nothing to do
with my father.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.900
It has nothing to do with us.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.235
Evil's everywhere...

31:46.605 --> 31:47.605
Lurking...

31:49.608 --> 31:52.809
Waiting for its chance
to gain a stronghold.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.048
It's in anybody.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.584
It's in everything.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.753
If we stay here,
it's gonna kill us.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.413
That's it.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.416
Just keep going.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.284
It's waiting for you.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.194
Where did you go?

33:21.867 --> 33:24.568
I don't know... it was
as though he was in, like,

33:24.570 --> 33:26.370
some sort of a trance, you know?

33:26.372 --> 33:29.039
Like, in his own world.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.108
I've never seen anyone
react the way he did

33:31.110 --> 33:32.642
when he looked at you.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.578
I mean, I-i-i love Mr. Marino.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.646
But it was like it wasn't him.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.949
It was, like... i don't even know
what to think of it.

33:41.754 --> 33:42.754
Zach?

33:45.758 --> 33:47.324
Zach!

33:53.365 --> 33:55.465
I'm sorry, no, it's, uh...

33:56.367 --> 33:57.601
It's nothing.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.138
No. No, no, no. It...

34:01.140 --> 34:03.306
It's not nothing.

34:03.308 --> 34:05.642
Zach, I want you to tell me.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.811
Please. I want to know.

34:10.481 --> 34:11.782
When I was a kid...

34:13.484 --> 34:15.652
I used to dream
that there was this...

34:17.388 --> 34:19.022
Other version of me.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.558
Scarier.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.027
I started...
Imagining him again.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.130
But it's... it's...

34:28.132 --> 34:29.599
It's different.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.002
It's, like,
he's... he's growing.

34:32.004 --> 34:33.804
It's, like,
he's getting stronger.

34:33.806 --> 34:35.739
It's, like, he... he...
He's trying to steal...

34:35.741 --> 34:37.373
Your soul.

34:38.876 --> 34:39.876
Yeah.

34:40.911 --> 34:41.945
Yeah, I...

34:44.248 --> 34:45.782
If he gets to stay...

34:47.018 --> 34:48.485
Then I'll just...

34:51.023 --> 34:52.023
Disappear.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.094
I know, it's pretty crazy, huh?

34:57.096 --> 34:59.029
No. No, no, no, no.

34:59.031 --> 35:01.031
You're not crazy.

35:01.033 --> 35:02.365
Okay?

35:02.367 --> 35:04.768
And you'll be fine, I promise.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.971
I will always be here for you.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.447
Good eggs.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.449
Yeah.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.055
Hi, hon.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.690
Hey.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.199
God, this can't be happening.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.006
Zach, are you okay?

37:56.008 --> 37:57.474
Yeah.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.679
Zach?

38:02.681 --> 38:04.247
Look, I-I'm fine, okay?

38:04.249 --> 38:06.116
I'm just washing up.
Be out in a minute.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.118
Oh, yeah?
Since when do you lock?

38:12.224 --> 38:14.791
It's... it's fine, okay?

38:14.793 --> 38:17.260
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.796
I suppose the welt on the side
of your head is just fine, too?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.431
Everything's just fine?

38:21.433 --> 38:23.933
Shawn, look,
it was a stupid accident, okay?

38:23.935 --> 38:26.269
I wasn't paying attention,
and I got my head caught

38:26.271 --> 38:28.938
between the car door
and the frame.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.141
You just knocked your head
getting out of the car?

38:31.143 --> 38:33.476
Yes, Shawn, I did.

38:38.884 --> 38:39.683
Ow.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.351
Stop, all right?

38:41.353 --> 38:43.219
It really hurts, okay?

39:45.684 --> 39:49.152
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.422
You rot in hell, demon.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.428
I die on my own terms.

41:29.753 --> 41:32.088
Oh, where'd that come from?

41:32.090 --> 41:34.090
Me and Shawn were...
Were talking the other day,

41:34.092 --> 41:36.559
and out of curiosity...

41:37.495 --> 41:40.096
How old was I when
those nightmares stopped?

41:40.098 --> 41:41.464
You remember those?

41:43.434 --> 41:44.734
Uh...

41:45.769 --> 41:48.071
Well, you had them
for a few years.

41:48.939 --> 41:51.241
Uh, were pretty much done
by the time you were...

41:52.142 --> 41:53.576
11, 12.

41:54.411 --> 41:56.913
But they affected you
afterwards.

41:57.982 --> 41:59.749
I mean, it took a while,
but eventually,

41:59.751 --> 42:02.552
you seemed to put it
all behind you.

42:02.554 --> 42:05.388
Why, hon? And, please,
just tell me the truth.

42:06.423 --> 42:09.092
I imagined something
the other day.

42:10.127 --> 42:12.962
I-I fell asleep in my car,
and I, um...

42:14.798 --> 42:17.133
It just...
It felt familiar,

42:17.135 --> 42:19.702
you know, reminded me
of... of that time

42:19.704 --> 42:21.404
for the first time in years.

42:21.406 --> 42:23.773
Don't fool around
with this stuff, Zach.

42:25.209 --> 42:28.511
Okay? It was a very disturbing
episode of your life.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.749
If you feel like
you need to see someone,

42:32.751 --> 42:35.018
please, don't blow it off.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.186
Just promise me, okay?

42:42.826 --> 42:44.227
Hi, there.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.029
Babe.

42:46.031 --> 42:49.032
This is Lilah cross.
She lives in the neighborhood.

42:49.034 --> 42:50.900
Lilah,
this is my boyfriend, Zach.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.468
Pleasure to meet you, Lilah.

42:53.604 --> 42:55.138
Hi.

42:55.140 --> 42:57.006
She might help me
with some art projects.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.541
Right, Lilah?

42:58.543 --> 42:59.809
Um...

42:59.811 --> 43:01.277
Maybe.

43:01.279 --> 43:02.378
I guess.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.651
I should... i should go.

43:08.653 --> 43:11.120
Well, I'm... I'm glad you came.

43:11.122 --> 43:13.289
And we'll talk again soon, okay?

43:17.596 --> 43:19.329
Wow. Well, she's charming.

43:19.331 --> 43:21.864
Just a kid
having a tough time fitting in.

43:21.866 --> 43:24.167
Yeah. I can't imagine why.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.537
It's not always that easy
for everyone, Zach.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.207
You know, sometimes
a single act of kindness

43:31.209 --> 43:32.942
can make all the difference
in the world.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.212
I...

43:36.214 --> 43:37.480
Shawn, what did I say?

43:37.482 --> 43:39.015
I'm sorry. Jeez.

43:44.723 --> 43:46.589
I was laid off in '96.

43:46.591 --> 43:49.926
I didn't know how I was going
to feed Molly and the boys.

43:49.928 --> 43:52.428
Your father just drove up
with a truck full

43:52.430 --> 43:55.131
of steaks, chickens, groceries.

43:56.601 --> 43:57.601
Ah...

43:59.070 --> 44:02.271
And the next month,
there he is again.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.474
Just don't know how you can
repay something like that.

44:04.476 --> 44:05.975
I know.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.644
Aidan, it doesn't make sense.

44:07.646 --> 44:10.513
He was always such a proud man.
Such dignity.

44:10.515 --> 44:13.049
He was the last guy
in the world to commit suicide.

44:13.051 --> 44:14.584
I-I just can't believe it.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.186
Excuse me.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.322
- I'm so sorry, Vince.
- Hey, Vince.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.290
I feel so badly.

44:21.292 --> 44:22.859
I don't know what to say.

44:22.861 --> 44:24.827
What can you say?
This is the...

44:24.829 --> 44:26.696
Craziest thing I...

44:28.266 --> 44:30.199
Listen, can...
Can you guys do me a favor

44:30.201 --> 44:32.001
and go on in and see Jo?

44:32.003 --> 44:33.469
She loves you kids,

44:33.471 --> 44:35.538
and it'd be nice for her,
you know, just...

44:35.540 --> 44:37.040
She hasn't been herself.

44:37.042 --> 44:38.841
Yeah.
Hey, anything you need, okay?

44:38.843 --> 44:40.910
- Okay. Yeah. I appreciate it.
- We're right here.

45:04.301 --> 45:05.835
Jo, are you okay, sweetie?

45:07.372 --> 45:08.372
Jo?

45:11.443 --> 45:13.843
Why don't I just sit
for a while?

45:23.654 --> 45:26.155
You guys are messing
with me right now, right?

45:26.790 --> 45:29.726
The guy actually hung himself
with a chain link?

45:30.729 --> 45:31.861
Who does that?

45:31.863 --> 45:33.229
Shut up, Timmy.

45:33.231 --> 45:34.664
No, I mean it.
What, he's just...

45:34.666 --> 45:36.132
Just dangling there

45:36.134 --> 45:38.067
shitting and pissing
in his boxers?

45:38.069 --> 45:39.836
Hey, that's enough, okay?

45:39.838 --> 45:41.804
We're friends with the family.
This is tragic stuff.

45:41.806 --> 45:44.407
Yeah, and Mr. Marino
was already pretty old.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.075
You know,
if he had died naturally,

45:46.077 --> 45:48.044
you'd say, "okay,
you know, it's sad."

45:48.879 --> 45:51.547
But for him to commit suicide
at his age...

45:51.549 --> 45:54.283
You know he was really
tortured about something.

45:54.285 --> 45:55.685
Had to be that mugging.

45:55.687 --> 45:57.086
He was traumatized, dude.

45:57.088 --> 45:58.187
I don't buy that.

45:58.189 --> 45:59.856
He was a strong man,

45:59.858 --> 46:02.225
and he dealt with a lot
of adversity in his life.

46:02.227 --> 46:04.060
It was something else.

46:04.062 --> 46:06.529
Something was haunting him
and wouldn't leave him alone.

46:10.901 --> 46:13.436
Okay.

46:13.438 --> 46:15.505
All right, now I know you guys
are fucking with me, right?

46:15.507 --> 46:18.574
Guys! Stop busting my balls,
all right?

46:18.576 --> 46:20.910
I just came over
to grab a couple of beers

46:20.912 --> 46:23.579
and have some laughs
with my friends, all right?

46:23.581 --> 46:26.382
So can we just calm down,
for Christ's sake?

46:26.384 --> 46:28.184
I'm taking myself off
all social networking.

46:28.186 --> 46:29.952
- Oh, yeah?
- -Yeah.

46:29.954 --> 46:31.621
I keep hearing from these kids
that we were in, like,

46:31.623 --> 46:33.256
- second and third grade with.
- Mm.

46:33.258 --> 46:35.324
- It's a pain in my ass.
- Yeah.

46:35.326 --> 46:37.693
Hey, I'm surprised anyone
looks for you anymore, man.

46:37.695 --> 46:39.228
People frickin' hated you

46:39.230 --> 46:40.696
in second and third grade.

46:40.698 --> 46:42.031
Fuck you, man.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.566
At least I wasn't crazy.

46:45.570 --> 46:46.570
Shit.

46:47.238 --> 46:48.404
I'm sorry.

46:48.406 --> 46:49.705
That was... that wasn't...

46:49.707 --> 46:50.707
That wasn't funny.

46:52.443 --> 46:54.644
Hey, what did people think
of me when I was a kid?

46:58.983 --> 47:00.249
You know,

47:00.251 --> 47:02.985
kids can be... Tough,

47:02.987 --> 47:04.520
you know,
especially when you're...

47:06.524 --> 47:07.524
Different.

47:08.593 --> 47:10.126
You weren't right, all right?

47:10.128 --> 47:11.327
You weren't right
for a long time.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.095
Everybody knew it.

47:13.097 --> 47:15.731
You know, sometimes you would
just kind of zonk out.

47:15.733 --> 47:17.266
Or even worse,
you'd start screaming

47:17.268 --> 47:18.801
about a bunch of crazy shit.

47:18.803 --> 47:20.002
- I did?
- Yeah.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.704
The school told your mom

47:21.706 --> 47:23.673
they couldn't manage you
flying off the handles and shit,

47:23.675 --> 47:26.375
so she took you away
for a few months.

47:26.377 --> 47:28.311
No one really knew
where you went,

47:28.313 --> 47:31.480
but when you came back,
you were different.

47:31.482 --> 47:33.850
You were good, you know.
Cool. It was good.

47:33.852 --> 47:35.351
Hey, man, why...

47:35.353 --> 47:36.786
Why have we never
spoken about this before?

47:36.788 --> 47:38.554
We've known each other
for years.

47:38.556 --> 47:40.156
This is the first time
it's come up. Why?

47:41.960 --> 47:44.160
Zach...

47:44.162 --> 47:46.495
You got
a really good thing here.

47:46.497 --> 47:50.766
I mean, you get to live
with a fucking goddess.

47:50.768 --> 47:53.302
I mean, dude, I can't even
hang out with you guys

47:53.304 --> 47:55.304
without wondering exactly

47:55.306 --> 47:56.739
what it is
that she lets you do to her.

47:56.741 --> 47:58.541
- Oh, yeah?
- You know what I mean?

47:58.543 --> 48:00.076
- You're thinking about that?
- Ow! Ow! Shit!

48:00.078 --> 48:01.844
- You fucker!
- Just saying.

48:01.846 --> 48:03.713
Law school by day,

48:03.715 --> 48:05.848
love nest by night.

48:05.850 --> 48:08.851
Shit, man, I'd give my right nut
just to have one crack at her.

48:08.853 --> 48:10.186
- Yeah?
- Just the right one, thought.

48:10.188 --> 48:11.821
It's the smaller one.

48:13.824 --> 48:15.391
You got a good life, man.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.393
You really do.

48:18.162 --> 48:20.362
Don't fuck it up by bringing up
all this old shit, okay?

48:21.866 --> 48:23.532
Doesn't matter.

48:23.534 --> 48:25.301
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

49:23.594 --> 49:26.195
Stop!

49:26.197 --> 49:28.197
No, stop! Stop!

49:31.069 --> 49:33.302
No!

49:58.730 --> 50:00.930
Shawn!

50:00.932 --> 50:01.864
Jo?

50:01.866 --> 50:02.865
Come here.

50:02.867 --> 50:03.899
Come here, Shawn.

50:03.901 --> 50:05.401
Jo, what is it?

50:05.403 --> 50:06.535
- Come here. Come here.
- Are you okay?

50:06.537 --> 50:08.204
You... you have to go.

50:08.206 --> 50:09.438
You can't stay here
anymore, okay?

50:09.440 --> 50:10.673
What are you talking about?

50:10.675 --> 50:12.675
The cottage... it's not safe.

50:12.677 --> 50:14.744
- You got to... you have to go.
- Jo, you're not making...

50:14.746 --> 50:16.946
No, no, no, no!
You don't understand, okay?

50:16.948 --> 50:18.481
You're in danger, okay?

50:18.483 --> 50:19.682
You... you have to go.

50:19.684 --> 50:20.816
- Hey, Jo.
- Oh, god!

50:22.053 --> 50:23.219
How you doing this morning?

50:23.221 --> 50:24.353
How's, uh... how's Vince?

50:27.692 --> 50:29.425
He's... he's fine. He's...

50:29.427 --> 50:30.693
He's waiting for me.

50:31.896 --> 50:32.962
So I have to go.

50:35.133 --> 50:36.465
What was that all about?

50:38.469 --> 50:40.770
This is just all becoming
too bizarre for me.

50:41.505 --> 50:44.173
- Shawn, it's...
- I've got to get going.

50:44.175 --> 50:45.708
I can't be late for the kids.

54:26.998 --> 54:28.063
No!

54:28.065 --> 54:29.965
No, you're not me!

54:34.672 --> 54:36.405
This is Cindy Bradford.

54:36.407 --> 54:38.207
Sorry I missed your call,
but please leave a message,

54:38.209 --> 54:39.842
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

54:39.844 --> 54:41.277
- Mom!
- Thank you.

54:41.279 --> 54:43.078
Mom, mom, please...

54:43.080 --> 54:45.080
Please call me as soon as
you get this, okay?

54:45.082 --> 54:47.416
I'm remembering again.

54:47.418 --> 54:50.219
I-I-i think it's... I think it's
fucking happening all over again.

54:50.221 --> 54:52.788
Please, can you just...
Can you just call me

54:52.790 --> 54:54.356
as soon as you get this, okay?

54:58.629 --> 55:00.329
- What's up, my brother?
- Timmy!

55:00.331 --> 55:02.131
Ah, Timmy, you're there?

55:02.133 --> 55:04.466
Yeah. Why so surprised?

55:04.468 --> 55:06.935
I would really,
really appreciate just, like,

55:06.937 --> 55:08.704
a hang-out right now.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.205
- Are you okay, Zach?
- I'll, uh...

55:10.207 --> 55:11.607
I'll see you soon, right?

55:11.609 --> 55:12.908
Okay.

55:22.486 --> 55:24.019
I agree with your mom.

55:24.021 --> 55:26.689
I think you should
see somebody, like, now.

55:26.691 --> 55:28.691
If you want, you know,
I could go with you.

55:28.693 --> 55:31.093
Hey, what was...
What was the name of that shrink

55:31.095 --> 55:32.561
that you saw
when you were a kid?

55:32.563 --> 55:35.097
Uh, Dr. Sommers, I think.

55:35.099 --> 55:36.799
But, man, I don't know.
I don't know.

55:36.801 --> 55:38.634
I think we should find
this Sommers guy.

55:38.636 --> 55:39.968
Hey, you know what?

55:39.970 --> 55:41.704
I'll just pass out on the couch.

55:41.706 --> 55:42.871
You know, I'll get up
in the morning.

55:42.873 --> 55:44.440
We'll just go together.

55:44.442 --> 55:45.908
What time's, uh, Shawn get home?

55:47.077 --> 55:49.244
Uh, late. She's, uh...
She's home late tonight.

55:49.246 --> 55:51.947
Good. Good.
Hey, don't tell her I'm here.

55:51.949 --> 55:53.949
I might get lucky
and see her naked.

55:53.951 --> 55:56.118
Make my whole
fucking year, right?

57:06.557 --> 57:07.656
Oh, god. Oh, god!

57:07.658 --> 57:09.425
Oh, god! No! Oh, no!

57:09.427 --> 57:11.760
No! Oh, god! Oh, god!

57:55.739 --> 57:56.805
Oh.

57:56.807 --> 57:58.340
Go on, boy.

57:59.543 --> 58:00.542
That's it.

58:00.544 --> 58:02.478
Just keep going.

58:05.349 --> 58:06.281
Stay away!

58:06.283 --> 58:07.349
No!

58:07.351 --> 58:08.417
Don't let him out!

58:08.419 --> 58:09.651
Don't come back!

58:09.653 --> 58:11.420
I'm always waiting for you.

58:11.422 --> 58:13.021
I'm gonna take you.

58:37.313 --> 58:38.413
Hey.

58:39.449 --> 58:40.749
Hey.

58:42.852 --> 58:44.853
What happened
to the bathroom mirror?

58:46.456 --> 58:47.689
I broke it.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.758
Oh. Okay.

58:52.795 --> 58:54.096
Shawn?

58:55.265 --> 58:56.465
Yeah?

58:56.467 --> 58:58.100
You would never leave me?

58:59.469 --> 59:00.802
No.

59:00.804 --> 59:02.104
Never.

59:39.175 --> 59:40.776
Have you seen Timmy
this morning?

59:40.778 --> 59:42.578
Timmy? What do you mean?

59:42.580 --> 59:44.046
Uh, he stayed over last night.

59:44.048 --> 59:45.914
He's gonna help me
with something.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.249
Um, I don't think so.

59:47.251 --> 59:48.917
There's no Timmy out there.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.820
You sure?

59:51.822 --> 59:53.155
Timmy's tough to miss.

59:53.157 --> 59:55.357
Pretty sure he's not here.

59:55.359 --> 59:57.392
That's strange.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:06.001
I do find it curious
that you've come to see me again

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:08.537
after all these years, Zach.

01:00:08.539 --> 01:00:10.839
Please. Have a seat.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.883
So...

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:23.685
What seems to be troubling you?

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:27.623
Um, I-i don't remember...

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:30.025
Much of my treatment
from back when I was a kid.

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:33.328
I just...
It seems like a black hole.

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.364
I-I just want to know
what was wrong with me.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.701
Memory recapture
is a delicate practice, Zach.

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:41.837
It's not always
in the patient's best interest.

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:45.440
Please, Dr. Sommers, it's...
It's really important.

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:46.508
I want to know.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.514
All right, then.

01:00:54.118 --> 01:00:57.085
Dissociative
personality disorder is a...

01:00:57.087 --> 01:01:00.889
Well, it's a clinical way of describing
a whole host of psychotic behavior.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:05.293
It may appear as
personality disorders,

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:09.097
schizophrenia, hallucinations,
sexual deviance and so on,

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:11.099
but in your case, it was a...

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:13.101
Severe
depersonalization disorder.

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:16.371
What is that?
I don't know what that is.

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:21.710
Can I, uh, interest you
in some tea?

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.712
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:24.913
Chamomile all right?

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.915
It's fine. Yeah.

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:29.184
Well, typically the, uh...

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:32.654
The patient may feel divorced
from his own body.

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.991
As though his own sensations,

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:38.994
emotions, behavior...

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:41.329
Are no longer his.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:42.864
They belong to another.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.805
Almost, uh...

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:52.140
Almost like you're in a dream,

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:54.142
watching a movie of yourself.

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:56.645
- Detached.
- Right.

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:59.581
Like you're, uh... you're not
part of the real world.

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:00.583
Mm-hmm.

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:04.252
It's most common among people

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.188
who've had
a traumatic experience,

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:08.523
but that didn't seem
to be the case with you.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:11.727
It started out
as a series of nightmares

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:15.130
that gradually
invaded waking hours.

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:17.132
You become more... Aggressive.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:19.736
More violent.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:22.739
You became...

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:26.074
Consumed by it.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.778
And then what happened?

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:32.647
You were medicated.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:37.185
Underwent some...
Hypnotic sessions.

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:41.923
But ultimately,
only a series of...

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.427
Electroconvulsive treatments

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:48.130
proved successful
in getting rid of the hysteria.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:59.407
Aah!

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.210
You were there?

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.148
The nightmares
eventually subsided,

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:10.218
and, uh, the images of this...
This other self disappeared.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.820
You got your childhood back.

01:03:11.822 --> 01:03:13.989
You're mother tells me
you're in law school

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:16.324
and in a healthy relationship.

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:18.126
Clearly, we were successful.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.995
You still speak with my mother?

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:23.131
I like to keep track of how
some of my patients are doing.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.733
For 12 years?

01:03:24.735 --> 01:03:26.067
Well, not usually, no.

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:28.870
But then...

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:30.605
Yours is not a usual case.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.944
You can have
a great life now, Zach...

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.747
If you choose it.

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:42.451
Trust me.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:46.188
Trust you?

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.056
Trust you?

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:49.758
You know what?
Fuck you, Dr. Sommers!

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.159
I trusted you once before!

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:57.732
Fuck! Fuck!

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.873
So how's your dad doing?

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:07.075
- He's good.
- -Yeah?

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:08.610
You guys getting along?

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:11.546
Yeah.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:12.548
Sure.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:16.751
Let me ask you something.
When you were...

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:21.423
Watching yourself acting up,

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.625
do you also see
whoever else is around?

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:26.128
Yes.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:31.132
And how does your dad react
when everything gets crazy?

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:34.369
Does... does he...
Does he get mad?

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.071
Is he... is he sad?

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:38.473
Scared, I guess.

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:39.574
Angry.

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:41.276
Doesn't really know what to do.

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:43.278
And does that, um...

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.980
That make you feel bad?

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:50.652
No.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:51.654
Not really.

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.990
Okay.

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:03.833
Zach?

01:07:02.486 --> 01:07:05.353
I'm so scared.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.529
You rot in hell, demon.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.732
I die on my own terms.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.778
Stop. No!

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:10.418
- Oh... sorry.

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.222
Mark, would you excuse me?

01:08:14.224 --> 01:08:15.557
Thanks.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:17.292
Hey, hon. Where have you been?

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:19.394
You know, I've been trying
to reach you for a while.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.962
Mom, why didn't you tell me
you still speak to Dr. Sommers?

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:23.398
I'm sorry.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.233
He... he just wanted
to be notified

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.334
the moment any of your...

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.770
Old problems began to resurface.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:30.572
Mom,
that's frickin' great, okay?

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.240
How many more surprises
are there gonna be

01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:34.209
before I find out
what the fuck is wrong with me?

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:37.479
Zach, no one is trying
to fight with you here, okay?

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:38.613
We're trying to help you.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.048
What did Dr. Sommers say?

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:41.916
Who gives a shit
what he said? Okay?

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.384
I didn't like him
when I was a kid,

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.618
and I like him a lot less now.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.187
He was a very big help to us

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:48.756
during a brutal time
in your life, okay?

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:50.158
Just listen to what...

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.626
Follow what he says, okay?

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.428
Mom, I-i-i got to go.
I got to go.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:55.296
Stay...
Just stay on the line for...

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:56.298
Zach!

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.399
Hey!

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:00.868
What the hell are you doing?

01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:02.871
No, no, no, no.
Come here. No, no.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.706
I want to know what you're doing
snooping around our house.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.341
- Let go of me!
- No, I'm not gonna let you go.

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:07.475
- Please, you're hurting me!
- No!

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:08.943
What's going on here?

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.411
I just, uh...
I just caught this one

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:11.645
sneaking around our house.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:12.647
I want to know what she's up to.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:13.781
Let her go, Zach.

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:15.183
She's not up to anything.

01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:16.225
She's just waiting for me.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.120
What is the matter with you?

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:21.756
You're so paranoid.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.457
I was just letting her
borrow this hat

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.193
- for a party she's going to.
- I just...

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.060
I just thought...

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:31.666
It's okay, sweetie.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.501
You don't need to be upset.

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:20.081
That's real nice, Andre.

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:26.421
Wow.

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:29.157
Huh.

01:10:29.159 --> 01:10:32.160
Maybe it's best
we don't send these home.

01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:34.162
Okay, miss Edmon.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.033
Maybe I should take these.

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:10.398
Don't do that.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:13.935
Leave it on.

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:17.939
Just the pants.

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:33.421
What's gotten into you today?

01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:35.556
Shh. Shh.

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:36.591
Against the window.

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:04.052
Stay still.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:14.922
What happened before?

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:16.357
I don't...

01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:17.925
I don't know. I don't know.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.194
That wasn't like you.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:24.065
What's happening to you?

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:27.602
I'm not sure.

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.985
I've never been
in a relationship before.

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:48.990
Did you know that?

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:54.996
You're my first love, Zach.

01:13:57.966 --> 01:14:01.169
And I looked for you
for a long time...

01:14:06.376 --> 01:14:07.775
I found you.

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:10.312
You did...

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:14.182
You did find me. I...

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:18.553
It seemed like one minute,
I was alone,

01:14:18.555 --> 01:14:19.887
and then the next...

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:21.422
There you were.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:23.758
I don't know what...

01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:26.627
What feels real or...

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:30.498
I don't know what's gonna last

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.700
and what might
get taken away from me.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.368
I told you.

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.904
- I won't leave you ever.
- Yeah, why, though?

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:39.106
That's just it, isn't it? Why?

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:40.975
- Hmm?
- Just look at you!

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:42.910
How is it possible
that there was no one before me?

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:44.412
I told you!

01:14:44.414 --> 01:14:47.114
I didn't want
to love anyone else!

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:50.485
I was too afraid that
something awful would happen

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:51.819
because it always did.

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:55.223
You make me feel safe.

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:58.426
You make me feel like
I'm allowed to love you.

01:14:58.428 --> 01:15:00.428
But am I right, Zach?

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.296
Is my love safe?

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:06.634
I'm worried.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:15.676
Then I'm sad for you...

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.213
Because you needn't be.

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:30.157
No, it's not gonna happen!

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:32.360
We're not sending Zach
to some mental-health lockup

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:34.161
where you can do
whatever the hell you please.

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:35.730
Daniel, just listen to what...

01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:38.032
- No! Forget it!
- Mr. Bradford...

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.901
He needs to be
in a controlled environment

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:42.503
where we can
properly treat his diagnosis.

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:44.572
Otherwise,
there's no guarantee of success.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:45.907
Please.

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:47.441
Please, Daniel.

01:15:47.443 --> 01:15:49.911
I am so afraid, honey.

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:51.712
How do you know he's even
diagnosed him correctly?

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.281
How the fuck do you know

01:15:53.283 --> 01:15:54.882
if you've never seen
anything like this?

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.417
Because any other explanation

01:15:56.419 --> 01:15:58.099
would be a hell of a lot
harder to swallow.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.456
I can't be part of this.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:04.659
You can do
whatever you think you need to.

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:15.903
You want to share?

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:20.141
Zach Bradford
came to see me today.

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:22.510
He did?

01:16:22.512 --> 01:16:24.378
Mm-hmm.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.047
What'd he want?

01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:28.249
What all my patients want...

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:29.350
My help.

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.854
But I thought you cured him.

01:16:33.856 --> 01:16:35.523
No.

01:16:35.525 --> 01:16:37.358
No, I couldn't.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:40.828
I just tried
to fool myself that I did.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.200
No, I was, uh...

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:48.336
I was lost.

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:53.174
It made me question
everything I believe in.

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.445
I copped out.

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.748
I just wanted it
to stop, you know?

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.620
So I, uh...

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:08.889
I erased his memories.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.894
Wiped him clean like...

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.364
Chalk from a blackboard.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:21.202
Honey, I've never asked you
to do this before, but...

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.206
I want you to refer him
to somebody else.

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:27.274
He scarred you for life
when he was ten.

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:30.244
Who knows what he's going to do
now that he's a grown man?

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.948
Promise me
you won't get involved again.

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.887
Okay. Pinkie promise.

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:44.091
You better.

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:46.894
Good.

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:52.566
Now, if you can manage...

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:55.536
To lighten up,

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:57.371
maybe I'll surprise you
in the morning.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.940
- Okay.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.621
He'll be sedated,
so he won't feel a thing.

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:16.123
He'll just...

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.225
Lose a little memory.
That's all.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:23.264
You know, I've loved that child
every minute of his life.

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.934
Look, you have to swear to me...

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:29.804
That he'll be all right.

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:33.407
You have to swear to me
that I'm doing the right thing.

01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:36.711
He will be.

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:38.713
And you are, okay?

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:32.566
I knew it.

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:34.635
I knew it
from the very beginning.

01:19:39.809 --> 01:19:42.076
Don't be afraid.

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:43.811
There's nothing we can do.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:47.815
Close your eyes, my love.

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:49.150
We'll be together forever.

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:14.254
Zach! Zach!

01:23:14.256 --> 01:23:15.956
You need to come!

01:23:25.368 --> 01:23:26.734
I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry!

01:23:26.736 --> 01:23:28.402
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:31.105
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:37.511
No, no, no, no. Whatever you...

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:38.979
Whatever you want.

01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:42.483
Help me! Somebody!

01:23:42.485 --> 01:23:44.351
Somebody! Somebody help me!

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:45.886
I'll do anything!

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:47.287
God!

01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:48.722
God, where are you? God!

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.891
Where are you, god?

01:23:50.893 --> 01:23:52.359
No, no, no, no, no.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:54.762
No, no.

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:03.771
There's no reason to be afraid.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:07.108
All this...

01:24:09.111 --> 01:24:11.111
It's just a dream.

01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:17.351
I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry!

01:24:17.353 --> 01:24:18.385
I'm sorry! I'm...

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:19.620
No! No! No, no!

01:24:19.622 --> 01:24:21.321
No, no, no, no! No, no!

01:24:21.323 --> 01:24:23.857
No!

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:57.324
I can't believe this.

01:24:57.326 --> 01:25:01.228
I can't believe that this
is actually happening to you.

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:04.765
Finally.

01:25:06.902 --> 01:25:09.970
We loved each other
once before, Zach,

01:25:09.972 --> 01:25:11.972
a very long time ago.

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:14.308
Can you remember?

01:25:18.114 --> 01:25:21.849
I suffered
from an incurable sadness.

01:25:23.853 --> 01:25:26.453
My mind was filled with visions.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:28.555
Voices so treacherous.

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:31.558
Temptations so cruel.

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:35.896
And in the end,

01:25:35.898 --> 01:25:38.899
my only choice
was to take my own life.

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:42.569
Or surrender.

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:47.975
No!

01:25:47.977 --> 01:25:49.977
No!

01:25:55.117 --> 01:25:58.085
You gave your life
trying to save me...

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:02.022
Save me
from what I was to become.

01:26:06.162 --> 01:26:08.996
And I grieved for you
like no other.

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:13.534
I searched for you over
the course of many lifetimes.

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:17.070
And I would've searched
for many more.

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:23.644
But then I found you.

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:33.554
I've always been with you,

01:26:33.556 --> 01:26:36.256
hoping...

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:38.592
Waiting...

01:26:41.597 --> 01:26:44.598
Trying to help you
make the passage.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.900
Help you become complete.

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.505
But you weren't strong enough.

01:26:51.507 --> 01:26:53.840
Please.

01:26:53.842 --> 01:26:56.210
Please don't leave me.

01:26:56.212 --> 01:26:58.212
Fight him, Zach. Fight.

01:26:58.214 --> 01:27:01.014
I'll wait for you, Zach.

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:04.518
So you remained trapped
in the body of a child...

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:07.621
Until now.

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:11.024
But now you're grown.

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:14.528
Now the boy has
finally become a man.

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:18.165
What have you done to me?

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:38.819
Mine is a capacity to love
that knows no boundaries.

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:44.224
I'll teach you everything.

01:27:47.029 --> 01:27:51.231
You'll experience a power
that is incomprehensible to all

01:27:51.233 --> 01:27:53.233
but a few.

01:27:53.235 --> 01:27:56.870
The power of life and death.

01:27:58.339 --> 01:28:02.876
There are those
that worship you as a god.

01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:05.746
They will grovel at your feet.

01:28:05.748 --> 01:28:08.615
You're finally mine.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.920
And I will never leave you.

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:20.560
I will love you... Forever.

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:37.210
As a child,

01:28:37.212 --> 01:28:42.916
especially during those fragile
moments of twilight sleep,

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:47.254
it's often difficult
to discriminate between

01:28:47.256 --> 01:28:52.459
our experiences
and our imagination.

01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:54.194
But as we grow,

01:28:54.196 --> 01:28:58.665
we're taught to place
in separate boxes

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:02.969
what is known to be real
and what we imagine.

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:14.381
But what if the child,
in his innocence,

01:29:14.383 --> 01:29:18.585
is simply more open
to other experiences,

01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:21.188
able to connect
the cosmos we see

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:23.190
with those we don't?

01:29:24.993 --> 01:29:27.694
I believe that as a species,

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.697
we are trying to raise
our consciousness,

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.401
become closer to god.

01:29:34.403 --> 01:29:37.003
But perhaps at every turn,

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:41.007
an equivalent force of evil
is present,

01:29:41.009 --> 01:29:43.543
attempting to block our path,

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:46.546
keeping us from becoming...

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:48.548
More divine.
