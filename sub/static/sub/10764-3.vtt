WEBVTT

00:07.040 --> 00:09.668
What dog did he steal that sweater from?

00:10.710 --> 00:12.200
Probably his wife.

00:15.982 --> 00:18.041
Good God, who shot the couch?

00:21.154 --> 00:25.147
Give her a break, Hilary.
She just won the Kentucky Derby.

00:27.827 --> 00:30.625
Who's that lady with Nell Carter?

00:30.730 --> 00:33.528
That's not Nell Carter. That's my father!

00:36.302 --> 00:38.327
God, you're so shallow. I hate you.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.498
You're stupid and ugly
and I wish you would die.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.097
- Sorry.
- Okay.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.607
Look at her!

00:46.646 --> 00:50.082
Brake! Hit the brake, Will!

00:50.950 --> 00:54.181
- What in the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry. It ain't my fault.

00:54.254 --> 00:57.189
I panicked.
That squirrel came out of nowhere.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.054
Philip, I'll call the manager
and have him remove the cart.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.686
Oh, let's just draw more attention
to ourselves.

01:02.762 --> 01:05.697
- Get in the cart, Vivian.
- No.

01:07.934 --> 01:12.894
I'm sorry, Mr. Banks,
but no golf carts in the dining room.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.708
You've certainly made a name
at this country club.

01:17.777 --> 01:21.213
I wouldn't be surprised if they revoked
our shuffleboard privileges.

01:21.881 --> 01:25.408
That's fine with me.
This place is wack. I'm out of here.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.244
Hold up.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.690
Special bulletin. Hormones to Will.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.718
Hold up yourself, Will.
That's Mimi Mumford.

01:36.563 --> 01:40.397
You can't get to first base with her
unless you impress her father.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.533
He's an eminent surgeon,
a championship polo player...

01:43.603 --> 01:46.595
and around these parts,
he's known as Dr. No.

01:46.673 --> 01:49.836
- Why do they call him that?
- Because he never says "yes."

01:50.276 --> 01:52.836
No young man is good enough
for his daughter.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.743
He ain't gonna have a chance to tell me no
'cause I ain't gonna ask.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.177
Mimi, if you're not busy on Friday night...

02:00.253 --> 02:02.847
would you like to accompany me
to the Apple Blossom ball?

02:02.922 --> 02:03.911
No.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.452
What's your name, boy?

02:09.062 --> 02:11.792
What school do you go to?
What college are you applying to?

02:11.865 --> 02:13.628
What's your career plans?

02:13.700 --> 02:16.863
I'm just a sophomore, sir.
I don't really know yet.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.029
Out of here, son. You disgust me.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:13.019 --> 04:16.079
So, what kind of guy
does Dr. No say yes to?

04:16.389 --> 04:19.358
Fellas with good grades,
good manners, good looks.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.015
In a word, me.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.892
So why haven't you made your move
on Miss Mimi?

04:25.965 --> 04:28.695
Not my type. Doesn't tickle my fancy.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.497
Well, she can tickle mine.

04:31.704 --> 04:33.899
If only wishing made it so.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.073
Let's face it, Will.
You lack the social graces...

04:37.143 --> 04:39.407
to impress someone like Dr. No.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.712
Boy, you must be on dog food.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.944
I am the most handsome,
the most intelligent...

04:47.020 --> 04:50.512
and unequivocally the most
flamboyant bachelor since Billy Dee.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.292
This isn't West Philly, Will. It's Bel-Air.

04:55.361 --> 04:57.226
And the women here are different.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.857
I guarantee you Dr. No will say no.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.957
- Yeah? I bet he won't.
- I bet he will.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.333
- I bet he won't.
- I'll bet he will.

05:04.837 --> 05:07.305
Who says the art of conversation is dead?

05:10.209 --> 05:13.076
All right, Will.
You think you can be a gentleman?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.410
How do you propose on going about it?

05:15.648 --> 05:17.707
Carlton, it's very easy to be a geek.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.514
All I have to do
is follow you around for a day.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.046
It isn't as easy as it looks.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.058
And with your father's permission...

06:00.126 --> 06:03.653
I'd love to escort you to
the Apple Blossom ball.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.263
I had no idea you two
were getting along so well.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.793
What's going on here, Carlton?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.736
Will's got a thing for Mimi Mumford...

06:13.806 --> 06:16.639
so I'm teaching him how to be
a perfect gentleman.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.938
I want a piece of this.

06:35.094 --> 06:38.154
Observe, Will,
this is how a perfect gentleman...

06:38.231 --> 06:39.823
talks to a young lady.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.099
"Say there, Mimi...

06:42.535 --> 06:46.835
"might I say that you rate a perfect 10
on my niftiness meter?"

06:48.574 --> 06:50.269
I don't think so.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.105
Uncle Phil, how did you used
to crack on the girlies?

06:58.351 --> 07:01.878
What I'm about to tell you
is going to change your life forever.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.379
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.122
First, I take her hand...

07:07.860 --> 07:11.762
then I stroke it gently but imperceptibly...

07:12.598 --> 07:15.533
Iook deep into her eyes,
blow gently in her ear...

07:16.002 --> 07:18.402
let my mouth curl up into a smile...

07:18.471 --> 07:21.702
make a low, rumbling, hypnotic sound.

07:28.881 --> 07:32.442
Philip, that's what you did
on our first date.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.453
- That's right.
- You're lucky you got a second one.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.325
Allow me, sir.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.255
Certainly, Geoffrey,
if you think you can do any better.

07:45.331 --> 07:46.764
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

07:47.633 --> 07:51.569
My life was but a mere whisper
until you entered into it.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.571
Whether it was chance or blind fate...

07:54.640 --> 07:57.507
or kismet, if you will,
that brought us together...

07:57.944 --> 08:01.038
I would be remiss to let this moment pass
without telling you...

08:01.113 --> 08:05.049
how deeply you have affected
the very core of my being.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.447
Baby!

08:21.000 --> 08:24.128
- The fish knife.
- Yeah, right.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.734
No, it is right. He got it right.

08:28.941 --> 08:32.068
- He got it right!
- He did?

08:32.144 --> 08:34.009
Get your own geisha.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.316
Excuse me, Master Carlton.

08:43.688 --> 08:47.352
- You were saying?
- Will, he picked out the fish knife.

08:47.426 --> 08:50.827
Will, I want you
to pay very close attention.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.729
Which one is the shrimp fork?

09:02.041 --> 09:04.475
By george, I think he's got it.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.712
I think he's got it.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.622
Where did he get that jacket?

09:19.759 --> 09:21.351
Probably off the rack.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.898
- Did you hear about his Jaguar?
- The one he bought secondhand?

09:36.309 --> 09:39.073
Okay, just remember
you're from Connecticut...

09:39.145 --> 09:42.672
you're transferred to Bel-Air Academy,
and you row on the crew team.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.841
Now, where did you transfer from?

09:45.017 --> 09:46.143
Bend over.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.447
It's Andover. We're going back home.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.917
I was joking, man. Relax. Hook it up.

09:52.992 --> 09:57.053
I beg your pardon, Dr. Mumford.
I have a friend who's new in town.

09:57.129 --> 10:00.064
He's the new star on the crew team.
Would you like to meet him?

10:00.132 --> 10:01.156
No.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.232
I respect your wishes, sir...

10:04.770 --> 10:09.434
but I'd just like to say kudos
on that polo match. Super form.

10:11.477 --> 10:15.004
You saw it, huh?
Excuse me. I didn't get your name.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.515
Smithers, sir. Kip Smithers.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.810
Have a seat, Smithers.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.178
- May I join you, sir?
- No.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.289
What school do you go to?
What college have you applied to?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.489
What's your career plans?

10:31.564 --> 10:34.590
Bel-Air Academy, Princeton,
and thoracic surgery, sir.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.332
Thoracic surgery. That's my field.

10:42.008 --> 10:44.476
What aspect of it interests you the most?

10:45.711 --> 10:47.110
The cutting part.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.681
That's the part I like, too.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.880
Listen, I'm glad you're a fan of polo.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.354
I have a very fine string of Arabians.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.223
Really? With turbans and everything?

11:02.662 --> 11:05.927
Very funny, Smithers.
You had me there for a moment.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.296
I thought you were a blithering idiot.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.738
There's my daughter.
Would you like to meet her?

11:14.840 --> 11:18.071
Gosh, sir.
There's a big question mark on that one.

11:19.278 --> 11:22.042
I seem to be painfully shy
with the fairer sex.

11:22.114 --> 11:23.775
Nonsense.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.044
- Hi, Daddy.
- Poodles.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.150
There is someone I'd like you to meet.

11:29.221 --> 11:32.713
Mimi, Kip Smithers.
Varsity crew from Bel-Air.

11:33.492 --> 11:36.655
A gentleman and a scholar
and soon to be a fine surgeon.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.187
You flatter me, sir.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.867
I'll just leave the two of you alone.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.269
- Mimi...
- Look, before you get yourself...

11:49.341 --> 11:52.742
all worked up into a lather,
I just would like to say this.

11:52.812 --> 11:55.747
I am sick of you
white-washed, preppy stuffed shirts.

11:56.482 --> 11:57.574
What?

11:57.650 --> 12:00.778
I don't need some stooge
who's going to play up to my father.

12:00.853 --> 12:04.789
I want a real man.
Someone dangerous. Someone exciting.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.786
Someone from the streets.

12:13.365 --> 12:16.129
- What's so funny?
- Yo, baby.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.835
Your prince is in effect, baby.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.501
I'm not down with this preppy nonsense.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.138
Carlton told me to do this.
I'm definitely straight out the 'hood.

12:31.217 --> 12:35.483
That was the worst homeboy act
I've ever heard.

12:36.388 --> 12:40.154
It's not an act. It's the real deal.
Yo, C! Come here!

12:41.260 --> 12:42.750
Mimi. Kip.

12:45.030 --> 12:49.558
Carlton, would you please tell her
who I really am?

12:49.969 --> 12:52.802
- Who you really are?
- Yes.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.199
He's Kip Smithers, from Connecticut.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.906
He transferred from Andover to Bel-Air,
so he could row with the crew.

12:59.979 --> 13:03.608
No. Tell her where I'm really from.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.406
England?

13:18.564 --> 13:22.466
For future reference, Will,
our club frowns on strangulation.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.699
This is all your fault.
You got me into this mess.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.261
- Me.
- Yeah!

13:27.973 --> 13:31.136
This preppy nonsense.
I knew women didn't like that mess.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.107
If I would've had my way,
I would've had my way.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.114
Congratulate me.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.711
It took all day but I finally found
the perfect pair of alligator pumps...

13:41.787 --> 13:44.585
to wear to
the Save the Everglades rally tonight.

13:45.491 --> 13:49.120
- Will has a crush on Mimi Mumford.
- That fat girl?

13:49.962 --> 13:51.930
Mimi is not fat.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.090
Not today. Liposuction.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.333
She's been vacuumed more times
than a hooked rug.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.468
She looks good now, right?
I don't see your point.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.577
Just wave a chili-cheese dog
in front of her nose...

14:08.647 --> 14:10.911
and see how much of your arm
you come back with.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.343
Will.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.014
So, how did it go with Mimi Mumford?

14:18.090 --> 14:19.682
He struck out.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.496
Okay, Will, you've taken advice
from Carlton, from Philip, and Geoffrey...

14:25.564 --> 14:28.590
but you have not gone
to the most logical source:

14:28.968 --> 14:30.595
The woman of the house.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.495
Before I was married,
I had my share of admirers.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.268
A sorrier bunch of deadbeats
you'll never meet.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.509
The ones that I was most attracted to...

14:41.580 --> 14:44.845
were the ones who were secure enough
to just be themselves.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.853
And that's my advice to you.
Just be yourself.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.283
Thanks, Aunt Viv.

14:55.294 --> 14:58.627
So, Will, are you going
to take Mom's advice?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.627
Man, you got to be crazy.

15:02.268 --> 15:06.898
Mimi wants a street-wise,
Harley, bad-to-the-bones type guy, man.

15:07.606 --> 15:11.599
If I could show her that I'm dangerous,
I'll have her like that.

15:12.511 --> 15:13.944
I'll bet you wouldn't.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.742
- I bet I would.
- I'll bet you wouldn't.

15:15.814 --> 15:17.441
- I bet you wouldn't.
- I bet you would.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.915
See, I fooled you.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.789
Remember, I'm wanted in five states...

15:34.300 --> 15:37.269
I'm hiding out from the police
for robbing a gun store...

15:37.336 --> 15:40.863
- and what did I do before then?
- You went to Penn State.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.601
I went to the state pen.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.301
Sorry. I thought Penn State
was bad enough.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.182
Mimi, top of the evening.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.686
Carlton, for the 900th time,
no, I will not go out with you.

15:56.121 --> 16:00.080
- I thought you said she wasn't your type.
- She isn't. She's too negative.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.126
I'm not here for that.

16:03.195 --> 16:06.164
Although if you just gave it
some objective thought...

16:07.833 --> 16:09.630
Anyway, I'm here for him.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.498
Does he need to go to the bathroom?

16:14.373 --> 16:16.568
No, he's just being his bad self.

16:17.042 --> 16:19.237
What you saw before was just a charade.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.541
Kip is his street name.

16:21.613 --> 16:25.606
K-l-P. It stands for conceived in prison.

16:27.219 --> 16:28.948
He's my cousin...

16:29.021 --> 16:31.888
and he's from the Bedford-Stuyvesant
region of Brooklyn...

16:31.957 --> 16:33.424
wherein he is a felon.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.723
Okay. Then what's he doing here
in Bel-Air?

16:36.795 --> 16:41.129
He's living with us to escape,
and I quote, "the man."

16:42.768 --> 16:43.757
Voilà.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.934
I thought you said he rode crew.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.032
No, baby. You misunderstood.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.805
He said I wrote for the 2 Live Crew.

16:54.913 --> 16:58.405
But, see, they kicked me out
because my lyrics was too abrasive.

16:59.551 --> 17:02.850
He's as nasty as he wants to be.
I kid you not.

17:04.823 --> 17:07.848
Baby. You look so good...

17:07.925 --> 17:11.089
I wish I could plant you
and grow a whole field of y'all.

17:13.565 --> 17:16.932
Yo, baby, Fresh Prince in full effect.
It's time to get busy.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.532
You can't hay, can you, baby?

17:31.617 --> 17:33.744
You work on that, all right, baby?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.683
Salutations, Doctor.

17:36.755 --> 17:39.189
This is quite an intense shindig, huh?

17:39.258 --> 17:42.659
Listen, I just want to find out
how things are going with Mimi.

17:42.728 --> 17:46.095
I'm having a little trouble
breaking the proverbial ice, sir.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.860
I hope I don't embarrass myself,
being in your illustrious presence and all.

17:49.935 --> 17:51.994
Don't worry. I'll just make myself scarce...

17:52.071 --> 17:55.336
but, I do have one piece of advice.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.535
- Be yourself.
- That's a natch, sir.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.445
This music is def, exceptionally def.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.186
Carlton, beat it!

18:09.688 --> 18:12.088
I'm dope. Yo.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.024
What were you talking to my father about?

18:16.095 --> 18:20.031
I told him if he don't stay out my face,
we would take it to the street.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.302
Baby, you close your eyes
when you dance with me.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.805
Salutations yet again, Doctor.

18:31.877 --> 18:35.244
Just a thought.
Mimi loves horses and you love polo...

18:35.314 --> 18:37.339
I thought that might break the ice.

18:37.416 --> 18:41.045
Thanks for the prescription, Doc.
Enough said.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.316
What were you talking to my father about
this time?

18:49.394 --> 18:52.830
I wasn't listening to him, baby.
I was stealing his wallet.

18:54.399 --> 18:57.732
Kip, I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you before.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.670
I should have seen right through
that thin charade.

19:00.906 --> 19:04.137
Let's go someplace and get busy.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.200
Yes, ma'am.

19:07.946 --> 19:11.746
- But first, I want you to rap for me.
- What?

19:11.817 --> 19:15.844
You know, let me hear some
of them abrasive lyrics.

19:15.921 --> 19:20.483
Okay, baby.
This one I got banned in Buffalo for.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.827
And that is just the type of music
we will not let our children listen to.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.564
Smithers, what is the meaning
of that ridiculous hat?

19:37.643 --> 19:39.338
Who put this on my head?

19:40.145 --> 19:41.669
Daddy, isn't he funny?

19:41.747 --> 19:44.477
No. He disgusts me. Get out of my sight.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.041
Wait a minute.
You can't talk to him like that, Daddy.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.986
He's practically a convicted killer,
and I love him.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.785
A convicted killer? Who are you?

19:52.858 --> 19:55.418
All right, look.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.629
I'm not a young republican
from Connecticut...

19:59.865 --> 20:02.163
and I'm not a hood from Bed-Stuy.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.327
I'm Will Smith from West Philly...

20:04.403 --> 20:07.861
and I've been busting my butt all night
trying to impress you...

20:07.940 --> 20:09.908
and trying to scare you.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.374
And I'm exhausted.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.339
I'm going home, and I'm going to sleep...

20:15.414 --> 20:19.680
'cause, baby, ain't no girl that fly for me
to go through all this trouble for.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.610
Yo, baby.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.888
What's up?

20:29.595 --> 20:31.085
Miss Hilary.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.722
Did you have a good time
at the Save the Everglades fund raiser?

20:34.800 --> 20:37.826
Geoffrey, these events are not about
having a good time.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.098
They're consciousness-raising
experiences.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.869
When you hear about all of the species
that are on the brink of extinction...

20:43.942 --> 20:47.207
it's grim, grave, and very sobering.

20:47.279 --> 20:50.806
- Tom Cruise was near tears.
- Wasn't he gorgeous?

20:55.053 --> 20:59.513
So there I was, G,
then this real fly honey walked by, right?

20:59.591 --> 21:01.388
So I decided I'll just be myself.

21:01.460 --> 21:05.692
I said, "Yo, baby." And she loved me!

21:05.897 --> 21:09.264
- Then what happened?
- Well, then her husband came in.
