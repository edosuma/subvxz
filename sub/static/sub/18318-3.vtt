00:47.581 --> 00:49.450
- I love this idea.
- It makes me cry.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.618
You know who doesn't
love this idea?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.420
The mayor,
the city council,

00:52.420 --> 00:54.888
the-the head of
the Vaporetto
drivers union,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.158
the Gondolieri.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.659
Convince them.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.362
Convince them.
You can convince them.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.765
You make my life
very difficult.

01:04.765 --> 01:05.933
But I convince them.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.901
Grazie, Beppi.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.304
- Buttafuco.
- "Budda."

01:10.304 --> 01:12.039
- So T is like D?
- "Buddafuco."

01:12.039 --> 01:13.374
Yeah, yeah.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.752
Five more seconds and
she'll be walking on stage.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.853
You have to hurry.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.359
Okay. Sorry, guys.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.195
Ey?

01:36.930 --> 01:37.998
Too what?

01:37.998 --> 01:39.167
Too big, too small?

01:39.167 --> 01:43.637
No.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.346
Okay, okay.
It's very nice,
it's very nice,

01:52.346 --> 01:54.482
but, uh, I think we can
carry that through.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.185
You know, the montait,
montait-- In one go.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.653
I'm not a violin.
You have to follow me.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.822
I'm sure you have
the control.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.057
Show me.
Sing it for me.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.593
Okay. Okay,
I'll show you.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.760
What do you mean,
I'm being tentative?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.496
Like, uh--
you're being like
a little puppy dog,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.498
instead of being
a pantera.

02:44.498 --> 02:49.237
Oh. Maybe because your tempo
is a little bit disco.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.671
D-- Did you say disco?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.241
Disco?
Vlad, is it disco?

02:53.241 --> 02:54.575
No, it's not disco,
Maestro.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.744
- Vlad!
- No, no, it's not disco.

02:56.744 --> 02:57.845
Hailey?

02:57.845 --> 02:58.979
It's a little disco.

03:01.815 --> 03:05.486
This boat--
This is not even
a barge, it's a raft.

03:05.486 --> 03:09.089
It's a raft?
Ai, I always meant raft.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.258
I didn't know.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.526
I meant a raft,
not a boat.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.062
Ecco, eh?

03:24.772 --> 03:28.342
Okay, like a--
like a shattering glass, okay?

03:28.342 --> 03:31.011
Degue chanson.
Chanson?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.547
La chanson.
La chanson.

03:36.584 --> 03:40.421
Don't speak to me like that
in front of them.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.356
Next time I'm gonna
kill you.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.826
Now laugh.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.763
El Guapo.
El Guapo.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.902
Why? You don't think
you are handsome?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.192
Dee Dee, you are gonna
take that diaper off

04:20.192 --> 04:21.562
before we go in,
I hope.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.897
It's called
Fundoshi.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.233
I wear it when I teach
my Taiko lessons.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.768
- All right, huh?
- Hey, guys.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.570
Sorry I'm late.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.339
Just dropped off
another happy customer.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.040
Can't believe
you're driver for Uber.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.241
Yeah, actually,
you know,

04:34.241 --> 04:36.577
you meet some really
interesting people.

04:36.577 --> 04:39.547
- Where's Betty?
- Uh, she can't make it.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.583
- Didn't she tell you?
- Tell me what?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.618
She's subbing with
the Honolulu Symphony.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.488
Oh, Jesus, guys,
we gotta stop the bleeding

04:47.488 --> 04:49.022
before they take
all of our people.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.458
What are we gonna do?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.826
Maybe we should look at
their offer again.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.363
No. We looked at the offer,
it's not good enough.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.930
- Yeah.
- I tell you what
we're gonna do.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.699
We're gonna stay strong
and dignified,

04:58.699 --> 05:00.668
and Dee Dee,
your left testicle
is falling out.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.371
- Aw, man.
- Look, I'll figure out
what we're gonna do.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.373
Okay?
I just need to think.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.407
Come on, we're late.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.081
Hai!

05:25.726 --> 05:28.128
Before you leave, remember,
you're all invited to our show,

05:28.128 --> 05:29.497
"The Dirty Filthy Stains."

05:29.497 --> 05:30.531
- Good work.
- Hey, thanks.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.265
- Okay.
- Come, yeah.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.302
Thanks for
having us, Lars.
The kids are great.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.405
Yeah.
It'd be a lot cooler

05:37.405 --> 05:39.773
if we had real
instruments to work with,

05:39.773 --> 05:41.942
but, uh, yeah,
they're trying.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.546
Yeah, well,
it felt really good
to be playing something.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.415
We needed this.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.050
Well, hey, you know,
if you need an escape,

05:50.050 --> 05:53.286
we're playing
a few gigs on the road
after the New York show.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.855
- You should come.
It'll be fun.
- Yeah?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.024
I mean, Lindsay
and the kids are comin'.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.158
It's gonna be great.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.894
God.
You have kids already.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.030
That's what
they call life, Cyn.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.133
It take it
there's still no
Mr. or Ms. Taylor.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.601
Nope.

06:07.601 --> 06:11.304
My last relationship sort of
fucked everything up, so...

06:11.304 --> 06:12.873
I'm, uh, giving it a break
for a while.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.845
Hey. At least come to
this gig.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.947
Come on.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.495
Where the fuck are you?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.029
Oh, you know,
in Venice.

06:36.029 --> 06:36.930
Walsh fired me.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.166
He fired you?
That prick.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.801
Yeah, I know.
I know.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.904
Don't you know anyone who needs,
like, an oboing nanny, or--

06:43.904 --> 06:46.474
It'll be fine.
Welcome to the life of
a working musician.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.941
Oh, shit,
I have to go.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.477
- Gotta go rehearse.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.011
Is Rodrigo there?

06:51.011 --> 06:53.180
- Uh, yeah.
- I need to speak with him.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.582
- It's really important.
- Cynthia.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.317
- No.
- Cynthia?

06:57.317 --> 06:58.686
- Maestro, I can hear you.
- She needs you,
it's really important.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.788
You can't ignore me
forever.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.757
- Hello.
- Rodrigo, I've been trying to
get hold of you for weeks.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.560
Hey! Cynthia.
I thought you were dead.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.061
The mayor has called us
to a meeting.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.230
The mayor? I don't know
nothing about the mayor.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.299
Everybody's talking about
the mayor, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:12.299 --> 07:16.837
- Yeah, we need you here.
- What? What-- What are
you talking--

07:16.837 --> 07:19.072
Because he's trying to
resolve the lock out.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.874
You know, I just heard
the word lock out,

07:20.874 --> 07:22.643
and that's it. Okay?
I'm not-- I'm not interested.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.411
No, this affects all of us.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.147
I can't talk
about the lock out.
Okay, ciao. Ciao.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.650
- Rodrigo. Rodrigo.
- Scuze. Attensione.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.984
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, No! No!

07:30.984 --> 07:32.786
- What?
- Stop it.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.222
- My fucking cell phone.
- But it's to liberate you.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.558
This is my cell phone.
You can't just take
people's things.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.894
- Guys. Guys.
- Cynthia, I'm really
sorry about that.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.131
He was gonna throw you
into the canal.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.033
Come on, let's--
let's go rehearse.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.267
No, I'm having
a really good time.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.841
Ahh.
They found me.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.614
Maestro, it's an honor
and a privilege.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.783
Antonio Parlotti,
a friend of La Fiamma.

08:02.783 --> 08:03.917
- Oh, ah.
- A viper.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.952
- Ah.
- Oh, oh, no.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.620
No, she means it
in a nice way.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.565
What about this tour?
We've heard rumors often.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.333
- Will you be joining her?
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.004
Perhaps you know she'll never
make it that far. Huh?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.574
And what's her current
tranquilizer dose?

08:26.574 --> 08:27.741
- Tranquilizer dose?
- Yeah.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.578
Tranquilizer?
You want a tranquilizer?

08:35.414 --> 08:37.585
Hey.
Alessandra.

08:37.585 --> 08:42.355
Hey. Don't pay attention
to that idiot. Okay?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.491
He only invents lies.
That's it.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.231
He's an idiot,
but he told the truth.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.101
Maestro, amazing!

08:54.101 --> 08:57.137
That picture will run
in every paper in Europe.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.207
I could kiss you,
but I don't.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.754
Where's the Maestro?

09:13.754 --> 09:17.324
I specifically asked
that he be here.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.192
- He's in Italy.
- Hmm.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.494
He left when Gloria's
Bubbles moved in.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.230
We'll have him back
as soon as--

09:23.230 --> 09:25.766
I don't care about
your Bubbles,

09:25.766 --> 09:27.300
or your excuses.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.838
What I do care about
is Tuesday night.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.040
Jeanine and I have been
long time subscribers.

09:33.040 --> 09:38.078
So, we're solving
this thing today.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.080
Okay.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.348
Let's go.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.854
- Go where?
- Now! Right now!
We're going.

09:48.155 --> 09:52.626
"To plant a garden
is to believe in tomorrow."

09:52.626 --> 09:55.595
Do you know who said that?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.164
Audrey Hepburn.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.400
- Oh.
- So there's your seeds,
your fertilizer,

10:00.400 --> 10:03.103
and some tasteful
German shrubs to
frame the blooms,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.272
and no talking about
the lock out.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.641
Dig your hands in,

10:07.641 --> 10:11.645
and make something
that grows together.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.148
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.918
Wait, wait. Don't just
drop them in there.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.755
- Oh. No?
- Pour them in your hand.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.623
Go ahead.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.860
Yeah. Now...

10:26.860 --> 10:28.328
feel their energy?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.165
Yeah.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.634
Feel the seeds.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.271
I've stopped a lot of
fighting in this garden.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.140
That bush,
the teacher's strike.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.676
The cedar,
the firemen.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.211
Those daisies--

10:44.211 --> 10:45.779
The garbage men.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.781
I think we should start
in the middle right here.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.151
We need to dig these holes
further apart, so--

10:51.151 --> 10:53.453
make sure the flowers
have room to grow.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.922
Here we go.

10:54.922 --> 10:58.726
Oh. Oh.
I hope I didn't get mud
on your Pradas.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.461
Uh, these are
the diffusion line.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.996
I got them on sale,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.398
and aren't those
Stella McCartneys?

11:05.398 --> 11:07.167
Fair point.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.937
You know, this has been
hard for everyone,

11:09.937 --> 11:10.971
and I'm really sorry.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.740
You know,
Warren over there

11:12.740 --> 11:14.341
has had to sell
his Bergonzi.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.210
Bob's driving for Uber,
Tanya's moved in
with her mother.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.747
Betty's in Honolulu,
which, you know,

11:19.747 --> 11:20.981
now I say it out loud
it doesn't sound so bad,

11:20.981 --> 11:22.215
but you get my point.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.284
I'm worried when
we do resolve this

11:24.284 --> 11:26.153
that we won't have
a symphony to come back to.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.921
Do you know how many
donors we're losing?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.456
Yeah,
that's how this works.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.524
A mutually assured
destruction.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.660
It's the only way
we seem to get you
back to the table.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.529
But every day we lose money,
we have less to give you.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.866
Cynthia, please.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.500
- As a friend.
- No, not the "F" word.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.335
Not after you
locked us out.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.071
But if you hadn't let
that lawyer of yours--

11:44.071 --> 11:45.305
You know what?
There was a deal

11:45.305 --> 11:46.606
right in front of your face
on the table,

11:46.606 --> 11:48.108
and you were
too proud to take it.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.843
Oh, please, you don't know
what I was doing.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.478
You think I don't know
what's going on here?

11:51.478 --> 11:54.181
Huh? You keep us waiting,
losing our minds,

11:54.181 --> 11:56.516
and then suddenly he called
and you want to talk?

11:56.516 --> 11:58.485
You know what we want,
Gloria,

11:58.485 --> 12:01.254
so why don't you call me

12:01.254 --> 12:03.456
when you're ready to
give it to us.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.026
I'm gonna-
I'm gonna take
a 10 minute break

12:06.026 --> 12:07.427
if that's okay
with you.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.898
You better figure
this shit out, Gloria.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.100
We got a budget meeting
in a week and a half,

12:13.100 --> 12:15.803
and this city's not gonna
keep pouring money into

12:15.803 --> 12:17.805
an orchestra
that doesn't play!

12:17.805 --> 12:21.408
And before that, apologize
to these damn plants.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.512
I'm very sorry.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.680
Every single one of them!

12:51.905 --> 12:53.140
I'm sorry.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.698
Look out there at my city.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.467
You can hear them laughing.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.009
Strange,
I can only hear
the seagulls.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.615
Because the people...

13:35.615 --> 13:37.450
they won't be
laughing at you.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.558
Your plane will take off
even if I-- I'm in ashes.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.932
Everybody knows that you
walked off stage once.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.903
Nobody knows why.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.209
Do you know?

14:14.988 --> 14:17.224
I started to lose
my high notes.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.359
I heard it in my head
again and again.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.928
Whenever anyone
talked to me,

14:20.928 --> 14:24.031
I couldn't hear
anything else.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.800
Just my voice becoming...

14:27.800 --> 14:28.969
old.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.141
I understand,
Alessandra.

14:34.141 --> 14:37.077
They want me to fail,

14:37.077 --> 14:39.012
and when they're eyes
are on me, I--

14:39.012 --> 14:41.014
I also want to fail.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.657
Then sing to me, then.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.625
I'm your audience.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.663
You're my audience.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.969
Yes, I am.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.308
Then I hate you.

15:17.550 --> 15:21.188
Maestro,
can I speak to you
in here for a moment?

15:21.188 --> 15:23.323
It's about some
programming.

15:23.323 --> 15:27.527
Oh, very-- Well, yes, uh,
absolutely delighted.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.998
Oh, come on. Oh, wow!
We are frisky.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.799
- Oh, my morning.
- Oh, my God.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.667
Oh, it must have been
a heck of a good meeting.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.436
Oh! It was a disaster.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.671
I just need--
I need to think about
something else.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.739
Oh!

15:39.739 --> 15:41.541
I am coming to Venice
with you.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.643
- You are?
That's great news.
- You were right.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.778
I know a little place,
it's so romantic.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.214
- Okay, good.
- Listen--

15:47.214 --> 15:50.517
So, I guess you heard about
the tour, right?

15:50.517 --> 15:53.520
What tour?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.755
Oh. Oh, God.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.324
Um, well, here.

15:57.324 --> 16:01.294
This is gonna put a damper
on your mood.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.231
He's not coming back.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.431
I didn't know that you were
such a good singer.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.633
I have to know
how it feels, Hai Lai.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.702
I have to know.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.108
How do you know
if you're good at it?

16:48.108 --> 16:51.344
At singing? Hai Lai,
I'm terrible at singing.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.181
Conducting.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.420
Okay.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.990
You surprise me,
Hai Lai.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.525
- Good.
- Come, come, come.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.859
Okay.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.230
Oh, my God.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.099
Okay, the podium.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.334
And the orchestra.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.269
- Okay.
- All right?

17:16.269 --> 17:20.140
Okay. Look at them.
Connect with them.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.609
- Lift your hands, remember--
- What piece are we doing?

17:23.609 --> 17:25.112
Oh, you have to know
what piece you're doing.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.213
Don't ask me.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.646
Which piece
are we doing?

17:27.646 --> 17:30.117
- Sibelius 5.
- All right.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.152
Hm. North Carolina
enters the big leagues.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.420
Okay? You ready?
It's in two.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.255
- Yes.
- So--

17:35.255 --> 17:38.858
Inhale.
Ah, bah.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.130
Yes. Yes.
Bah.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.299
Yes. Got it?

17:46.299 --> 17:47.600
- Yeah.
- Si?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.902
Yeah.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.639
Now look at them.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.374
All right.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.676
There's that little
batutta section which
you have to know by heart,

17:56.676 --> 17:58.178
because if not,
it's gonna choke you,

17:58.178 --> 17:59.179
you know,
it's gonna win you,

17:59.179 --> 18:00.180
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.614
Connect with them,
okay?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.383
Like a little
teasing thing with flow.

18:03.383 --> 18:08.521
Bah. They're so--
bah, da, da, da, da.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.958
You know that
Sibelius called this
his struggle with God?

18:11.958 --> 18:14.026
You know that?

18:14.026 --> 18:16.163
Are you ready to
join the struggle?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.530
Yeah.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.466
Okay. Okay.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.035
That's it, stronger.

18:25.372 --> 18:30.243
And now, if you want to
make them play, Hai Lai--

18:30.243 --> 18:32.545
You have to become
a child again.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.882
Yeah, how do I do that?

18:35.882 --> 18:37.584
Go away.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.919
Close your eyes
for a little bit.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.723
Yes.

18:43.723 --> 18:47.327
For me it's
going back to Mexico
with Maestro Rivera.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.211
And... open your eyes.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.378
Give it to them.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.650
Big.

19:14.521 --> 19:18.090
On the left side here,
you get Warren Boyd.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.361
If you mess up,
he'll always save you.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.296
He'll always be there
for you. Always.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.998
I owe you one
Warren Boyd,
I owe you one.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.674
Bob the union.
He's very good.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.409
He's always rushing
a little bit,

19:36.409 --> 19:38.378
but it's out of joy,
out of love for the music.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.413
You know.
All right?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.249
Betty Cragdale.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.852
Okay, the best.
She's-- you know,
she can do anything.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.820
She's like the salt
in the dessert.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.357
And Cynthia, she plays
with such passion
and such sadness.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.691
I-- I don't know
where it comes from.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.726
Use it. Okay?
Sublime.

19:55.027 --> 20:00.400
Now, once you've
connected with everybody,

20:00.400 --> 20:01.934
at that point--

20:06.005 --> 20:07.974
You feel you're home.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.313
That you're not alone.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.360
Hey.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.995
Hey.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.868
Hailey.

20:35.868 --> 20:36.903
Hey!

20:36.903 --> 20:40.373
Maestro.
It's good to see you.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.574
We miss you in New York.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.576
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.513
I'll be right down.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.448
So what's she like,
you know?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.550
The great Alessandra.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.619
It's like a little scary.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.387
- Really?
- She's like the
Stevie Nicks of opera.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.327
What's goin' on?
Are you all right?

21:00.327 --> 21:04.130
Yeah. No, no.
I'm--

21:04.130 --> 21:08.100
Just wondering
what's going on
with the strike.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.069
You know I'm not
supposed to really
talk about it.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.905
I know, I know,
I just, like--

21:12.905 --> 21:15.742
It can't go on
that much longer, right?

21:15.742 --> 21:18.345
What's Rodrigo
said about it?

21:18.345 --> 21:20.347
Nothing, really.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.714
Maybe that's part of
the problem.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.351
He just has
a bad relationship
with red tape.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.652
Core responsibility.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.019
He didn't cause this.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.589
The board are the ones
that locked us out.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.824
I mean, maybe we should
just change the subject.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.227
I'm sorry.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.364
I know it's not your fault,
I know you're on our side.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.702
I need to tell you
something.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.472
What?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.874
I voted against
the orchestra's counter offer.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.680
- Hailey.
- Goodbye.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.382
Hailey, sit down.
Come on.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.684
Look, Hailey, it--
Come on, it's complicated.

21:57.684 --> 22:00.520
It was to contain Biben,
protect Rodrigo.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.389
Yeah, but I've been
complaining to you

22:02.389 --> 22:05.024
about how screwed up
all of my friends' lives
are because of the strike,

22:05.024 --> 22:08.227
and the whole time
you're the one who
fucking caused it.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.029
So go fuck yourself,
Erik.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.654
How did you do it?

22:37.123 --> 22:38.458
What?

22:38.458 --> 22:41.494
How did you leave the thing
that you love most?

22:42.429 --> 22:43.596
It left me.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.101
Why do you think
I asked you to come here?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.009
You're too tentative.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.480
You think that
I'm too tentative?

23:33.480 --> 23:34.981
Too tentative.
