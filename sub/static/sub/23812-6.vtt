this location, Arc?

00:10.044 --> 00:11.810
Pretty perfect,
don't you think?

00:11.912 --> 00:13.312
- Ah, I don't know.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.715
Does this clearing
really say "Team Portrait"?

00:16.817 --> 00:18.917
- It says we've been
walking for hours...

00:19.020 --> 00:21.053
pick a spot.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.988
- Hey, cut my
boy a break.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.957
But, seriously,
pick a spot.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.460
- Guys, come on.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.163
This portrait
means a lot to Arc.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.098
He's never been
part of a team before.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.466
- Yeah, before
knight school,

00:34.568 --> 00:36.869
I was just a handsome
lone wolf.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.775
- I hope that howl means
you like this spot.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.377
- All right, I suppose
this place will have to do.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.112
Nah, there's
a weird boulder.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.647
- Not for long.

- Oh!

00:59.527 --> 01:02.294
- Oh...

01:02.396 --> 01:04.328
- That must be the Lost
Cave of Farts.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.998
- I think I know
why they lost it.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.166
- Yeah.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.267
- Let's get outta here.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.535
- Unh-unh,
hold your breath!

01:09.637 --> 01:11.804
Lou, pick up your brush
and paint like the wind.

01:11.906 --> 01:15.441
- Fine, but let's all remember
the team pose we agreed on.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.712
- Why did we agree to this?
- Shhhh!

01:20.815 --> 01:21.914
Smile.

01:22.016 --> 01:24.650
- I can taste
the smell.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.958
- I can't believe it!

01:33.060 --> 01:35.327
I'm free!

01:35.429 --> 01:36.595
Jimbo?

01:36.697 --> 01:38.497
Ahhh!

01:40.167 --> 01:42.468
- Guys,
is it really you?

01:42.570 --> 01:45.404
- You guys know this
filthy skunk boy?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.873
- He's our old
Phoenix Squad teammate.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.341
- Squad hugs!

01:49.443 --> 01:52.511
- Oh! We'll hug
after you shower.

01:59.153 --> 02:00.319
Sir Gareth!

02:00.421 --> 02:02.254
Get your hands
off my boss!

02:02.356 --> 02:04.823
- Uh-uh-uh-uh!
Relax, Fizz.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.825
I have a tooth
that needs to come out.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.759
But it's no big deal
once you've lost an eye,

02:08.863 --> 02:11.630
and a hand,
and a butt cheek.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.232
- Then why
are you tied down?

02:13.334 --> 02:16.068
- Well, whenever someone's
about to cause me pain, my...

02:16.170 --> 02:17.536
my battle
instincts kick in.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.072
I've beaten up every dentist
in Astoria except...

02:20.174 --> 02:21.140
except for him.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.274
Get in there, doc.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.042
Ahhhh...

02:32.086 --> 02:34.887
Give my love to
Surly and the twins.

02:34.989 --> 02:35.954
Oh!

02:36.056 --> 02:37.156
He was my last hope.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.324
- Don't worry, I'll help you.
- I don't want your help.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.226
- That's your nasty
tooth talkin'.

02:44.064 --> 02:47.866
- Aw, training yard!
Give Jimbo a hug!

02:53.140 --> 02:53.939
- Poor guy.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.707
Being trapped in
that cave for so long

02:55.809 --> 02:57.476
must've really messed
with his mind.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.511
- Actually, he's
always been a little weird.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.446
- Did he always
eat rocks?

03:03.050 --> 03:05.450
Mmmm! Crunchy!

03:07.388 --> 03:08.854
- No, that's new.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.357
- Oh! Jimbo!
Is that you?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.927
- No, it's me,
Buttercup.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.930
- That is Jimbo! Yes!

03:18.032 --> 03:20.265
I told the king I didn't
lose another student.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.502
- Wait, now, how many
students have you lost?

03:23.604 --> 03:25.504
- Buh-buh-buh-buh-
buh-buh-buh-buh.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.106
Jimbo,
it's been months.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.041
What happened to you?

03:29.143 --> 03:31.109
- I was frolicking
through the woods,

03:31.212 --> 03:32.477
picking fruit for a pie,

03:32.580 --> 03:35.214
when I slipped and rolled
down a hill into a cave.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.848
Then a rockslide
trapped me in.

03:36.951 --> 03:38.450
- Ha!

03:38.552 --> 03:40.986
I mean, awww...

03:43.224 --> 03:44.723
Yeah, no,
I mean, ha!

03:46.493 --> 03:48.393
- How long did you look
for me, Phoenix fam?

03:48.495 --> 03:50.128
- We searched every
day for weeks.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.697
We left no
stone unturned...

03:51.799 --> 03:54.466
except for that big stone
you were trapped behind.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.235
- I even went into
Giant Town to make sure

03:56.337 --> 03:57.936
that nobody
accidentally ate you.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.606
It happens.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.975
- Eventually,
we figured you'd left

04:03.077 --> 04:05.510
to follow your dreams
of becoming a baker.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.379
- Nope, I was just
suffering alone

04:07.481 --> 04:09.014
in a really
stinky cave.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.682
- Ha!

04:10.784 --> 04:12.951
It just keeps getting
better and better.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.822
- I survived with
my can-do attitude

04:16.923 --> 04:19.690
and the help of
my best friend, Shielda.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.965
- Suddenly, eating rocks
doesn't seem so strange.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.602
- Well, students,
it is my pleasure

04:30.704 --> 04:33.405
to officially welcome Jimbo
back into Phoenix Squad.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.509
- Now we have
five members.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.578
- Oh, what's that,
Buttercup?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.246
Knight school rules
state that a squad

04:41.348 --> 04:43.715
can only have
four members.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.418
- No, I said,
squirrels love hugs.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.588
- Oh. Sage is correct.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.456
A squad can only
have four members.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.691
- Tough break, Jimbo.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.893
Well, at least you
still have Shielda.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.729
- Actually, since Jimbo was
in Phoenix Squad, first,

04:57.831 --> 04:59.798
he's in, you're out.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.635
- I'm no longer
a member of Phoenix Squad?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.404
- What?
- No.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.538
- Why?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.473
- We all know
I'm gonna say, ha, right?

Jimbo did it.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.116
- Hey, Arc!
- Jimbo did it!

05:51.218 --> 05:53.218
- We were looking
everywhere for you.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.220
- I'm just saying bye
to the Squad Room.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.655
Now that I'm not
on Phoenix Squad,

05:56.757 --> 05:58.623
I won't be able to
hang out here anymore.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.093
- There's gotta be
a loophole in the rules.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.295
Bookshelf,
macro rulebook.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.934
I'm gonna miss that.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.335
- Arc, you can't go.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.670
You're still one of us

06:11.772 --> 06:13.472
and a team doesn't
give up on each another.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.140
Yeah!

06:15.242 --> 06:16.708
- Before you came,
we were in last place.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.510
- Now we're unstoppable.
- Yeah!

06:18.612 --> 06:20.045
- And we're gonna
do whatever it takes

06:20.147 --> 06:21.346
to get you back
on this squad.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.848
Yeah!

06:22.950 --> 06:24.349
Wait. How?

06:25.686 --> 06:26.818
- We'll come up
with something.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.222
Just hang tight and please
don't do anything crazy.

06:30.324 --> 06:33.058
- When have I ever
done anything crazy?

06:33.160 --> 06:34.226
- You stole that
witch's broom.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.327
- You started
that cat rodeo.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.461
- You gave
an ogre a wedgie.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.263
- I get your point.

06:39.366 --> 06:42.367
I promise I won't
do anything else crazy.

06:42.469 --> 06:45.270
But, for the record, that ogre
gave me a wedgie, first.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.952
- Mmmm!
Floor donut.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.257
Mmmmm!

07:05.359 --> 07:07.125
Oh, what's tied
around my tooth?

07:07.227 --> 07:08.627
- Time's up, toothy!

07:19.540 --> 07:21.039
- Sorry, Fizz.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.308
I told you my battle
instincts are just too strong.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.076
Stop trying to help me.

07:25.179 --> 07:26.511
- Don't worry, sir,

07:26.613 --> 07:29.548
me and that tooth
are just starting to tango.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.092

07:43.597 --> 07:44.896
- Okay, according
to the rulebook

07:44.998 --> 07:47.632
there's only one way to get
Arc back on Phoenix Squad.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.202
We have to convince
Jimbo to quit.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.304
- Ooh, maybe he'll
do what we say,

07:52.406 --> 07:54.840
if I hold him upside
down over a cliff.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.777
- Or...

07:58.879 --> 08:01.546
since he loves baking
more than being a knight,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.648
maybe we can convince
him he's best at it,

08:03.750 --> 08:05.183
and he'll quit
to become a baker.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.352
- And if he doesn't,
then Prudy will...

08:07.454 --> 08:09.521
- We're not holding
anyone over a cliff.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.124
- Hey, guys!
- He's coming. Be nice.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.761
- WARWICK, PRUDENCE, CIARA:
Hi, Jimbo.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.263
- What have you
got there?

08:18.365 --> 08:21.366
- I know I'm supposed to be
practicing my attack moves,

08:21.468 --> 08:24.002
but Shielda asked me to bake
you guys some muffins.

08:25.906 --> 08:30.342
- Mmmm! Oh, my goblin,
Jimbo. So yummy!

08:30.444 --> 08:31.676
Right, guys?

08:31.778 --> 08:33.945
- Yeah, these muffins
are so good.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.580
- You have a gift.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.414
- Have you ever thought
about quitting knight school

08:37.518 --> 08:39.484
and becoming a baker,
because you should.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.654
- Do you really
think they're that good?

08:42.756 --> 08:44.589
- Oh, yeah.
- Totally.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.157
- You're the best.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.693
- He's the best?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.565
- Jimbo, you're amazing.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.734
I mean, no one can
do what you do.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.803
- Arc didn't bake you
guys delicious muffins?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.739
- Arc who?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.073
- Arc me.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.209
Hey!

09:05.646 --> 09:08.880
- Wow, they moved
on fast, huh?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.448
It's like you were
never even there.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.883
- That's not what's
happening, all right?

09:11.985 --> 09:13.552
Ciara just said they're
figuring out a way

09:13.654 --> 09:15.086
to get me back
on Phoenix Squad.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.521
- Oh, really?

09:16.623 --> 09:18.356
Then why are they doing
the muffin dance with Jimbo?

09:18.458 --> 09:19.991
- ♪ Muffin dance ♪

09:20.093 --> 09:22.561
♪ Muffin dance, yeah ♪

09:22.663 --> 09:25.330
- ♪ Boy you better bake
what your mama gave you ♪

09:25.432 --> 09:27.566
- I can't believe this.
- ♪ Muffin dance ♪

09:27.668 --> 09:29.768
- How is that supposed to
get me back on the squad?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.202
- They must have
changed their mind

09:31.305 --> 09:32.771
and picked
Jimbo over you.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.573
- And they
picked his steel friend

09:34.675 --> 09:36.107
over you, too.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.013
- How am I supposed to compete
with that foxy shield?

09:43.517 --> 09:45.784
- Here's a crazy idea.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.553
Kraken Squad's
looking for a fourth member.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.755
Kripan just quit,
didn't you?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.463
- Why would
I ever join your squad?

09:58.565 --> 10:01.566
- Because, if you
become a Kraken,

10:01.668 --> 10:03.835
we'll be the best
squad ever.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.870
- Even though I miss
being part of a team,

10:05.973 --> 10:08.673
I wouldn't join
you in a million years.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.475
- Thanks for believing
in my dream.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.645
Squad hug?
I showered.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.983
- Now you're trapped
inside the Cave of Hearts.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.419
- That does it!
I'm joining Kraken Squad.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.520
- Yes!

10:22.623 --> 10:24.723
- Squad hug!
- We're not huggers.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.763
♪ Oh oh oh,
ah ah ah ah ♪

10:39.773 --> 10:44.609
- Arc, today you will
be joining Kraken Squad.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.344
Are you ready...

10:46.446 --> 10:48.813
for your initiation?

10:48.915 --> 10:52.450
- I was before you
said it like that.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.253
- Buttercup,
release the kraken!

10:59.726 --> 11:02.127
- Wait. The kraken's
in that little bucket?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.999
Awww...

11:08.101 --> 11:10.101
look at you and your
itty-bitty adorable...

11:10.203 --> 11:11.770
Ah!

11:14.007 --> 11:16.608
- The baby kraken
slapped Arc in the face.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.943
That means she likes you.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.114
- Arc, you're
a Kraken now?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.449
- He will be,

11:24.551 --> 11:26.084
after the flaming
spears ceremony.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.120
- We'll call you when
the spears are hot and pokey.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.192
- Arc, what are
you doing?

11:34.294 --> 11:36.261
- Well, since you guys
are so happy with Jimbo,

11:36.363 --> 11:37.696
I decided to
move on, too.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.998
- Yay, Arc has
a new team.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.334
Someone's getting
a kraken cake.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.605
- Did my best friend
just become a Kraken?

11:47.708 --> 11:49.974
Oh, give me that bucket.
I think I'm gonna puke.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.513
- Whoa, that hit
you hard.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.815
Does it hurt?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.917
- Of course,
it hurts.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.554
- Arc, I told you to wait
and not do anything crazy.

12:02.656 --> 12:03.722
Hello!

12:03.824 --> 12:04.956
Joining the Kraken Squad

12:05.058 --> 12:07.258
is like taking the crazy
cart to Crazy Town.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.061
- Well, I only did that because
you ditched me for Jimbo.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.630
That's right,
I saw your muffin dance.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.933
- ♪ Muffin dance,
muffin dance ♪

12:16.002 --> 12:17.335
It's really catchy.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.171
- Arc, we can explain.
- Save it.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.373
You guys made your choice
and I made mine.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.209
I'm better off
with the Krakens.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.348
They may slap
you in the face,

12:30.450 --> 12:32.851
but at least they
don't stab you in the back.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.325
That was a slap,
not a stab.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.172
- Fizz!

12:55.742 --> 12:57.242
Are you here?

12:59.646 --> 13:03.214
You are not going
to get my tooth.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.351
I'm a knight.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.820
You cannot
sneak up on me.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.022
- But my horse can!

13:12.359 --> 13:13.958
Charge!

13:14.060 --> 13:15.527
Oh! Oh!

13:20.600 --> 13:22.834
- Did we get it,
Tea Biscuit?

13:29.209 --> 13:32.410
- Guys, I'm just here
to get my stuff.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.982
Oh, and, uh, grab my ribs
I left here labelled, um...

13:38.084 --> 13:40.251
"Prudy's snack.
Keep away."

13:46.860 --> 13:50.261
Ah, Shielda, today
is a fantabulous day.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.531
The sun is shining,
the oven is pre-heated,

13:53.633 --> 13:55.300
for revenge!

13:56.870 --> 13:58.570
Phoenix Squad
is gonna be sorry

13:58.672 --> 14:00.705
they stopped
looking for us.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.307
That's not cool!

14:03.276 --> 14:05.376
- What?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.078
- I said, not cool.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.849
Wow, that cave really
did mess with your head.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.117
- Oh, yeah, you try eating
rocks for ten months.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.821
- What are you gonna do
to the Phoenix Squad?

14:16.923 --> 14:18.356
- Well, I was gonna
knock them out

14:18.458 --> 14:19.891
with this
sleeping sulphur

14:19.993 --> 14:21.559
I brought from
the Cave of Farts, but...

14:21.661 --> 14:22.861
you'll do.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.436
- Well, it looks like your
little gas trick didn't work.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.945
I know, Shielda. That
did work really well.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.947
- ♪ Ah ah ah ah ah ♪

14:54.594 --> 14:56.227
- Oh, what's that stench?

14:56.329 --> 14:58.997
- That's the funk
of your new home.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.668
Welcome to
the Cave of Farts!

15:06.339 --> 15:08.206
- I'm not gonna let
you get away with this.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.576
Oh! Oh! Wow!

15:12.812 --> 15:14.679
What did this
cave eat last night?

15:15.982 --> 15:18.149
- Don't worry. You don't be
a Lonely Larry for much longer.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.517
- What do you mean?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.319
- By now, Phoenix Squad
should have found

15:21.421 --> 15:23.888
the note I left them saying
that I took you captive,

15:23.990 --> 15:25.490
and to come alone.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.759
I left them with
a freshly-baked nut cake.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.128
- Trust me,
they're not coming for me.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.629
I bet you a million
gold pieces

15:31.731 --> 15:32.897
they don't show up here.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.065
- We're here!

15:34.167 --> 15:35.733
- We never shook on it.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.370
- Unchain Arc. He's part
of the Phoenix Squad.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.738
- That's right.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.507
Also, who ate my ribs?!

15:44.411 --> 15:45.410
- Zip it!

15:45.512 --> 15:46.978
You left me trapped
in this stinky cave,

15:47.080 --> 15:48.579
and I'm gonna do
the same to you.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.281
- You got
yourself trapped

15:50.383 --> 15:52.150
when your berry-picking
butt fell down the hill.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.119
- Excuse me for wanting
to use fresh ingredients.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.122
- Dude, we didn't know
you were in here.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.224
- No one's gonna know
you're in here, either.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.262
- Warwick, use your magic
to break Arc's chain.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.631
- On it.
Achy breaky, chainy chain!

16:08.668 --> 16:10.668
- Hey!

16:10.770 --> 16:13.972
- Magic is hard, guys.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.541
- Enough!
Get them, Shielda!

16:24.284 --> 16:26.584
- All right, Shielda,
that's our cue to leave.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.819
Smell ya later.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.690
- Prudy, grab Arc and let's
get outta this cave!

16:37.964 --> 16:41.099
- Or get comfy
because now we're stuck.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.135
- All right,
I'm just gonna say it.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.170
Shielda...
kind of a jerk.

Fizz?

16:56.783 --> 16:57.882
What's all that?

16:57.984 --> 16:59.684
- I let you down,

16:59.786 --> 17:03.254
so, I'm quitting
and cleaning out my office.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.422
- You don't have
an office.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.523
- What's why
my box is empty.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.928
- Well, I'm sorry
to see you go.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.730

you're so easy to trick.

you gave up!

17:19.439 --> 17:21.105
- Never!

17:23.510 --> 17:26.444
- Ahhhh! You're
biting me!

17:29.315 --> 17:31.783
- I'm sorry, Fizz,
it's my battle instincts.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.151
I didn't mean
to bite you.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.019
- You didn't bite me.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.788
You bit this.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.157
- Is that your armor?
- Yep.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.692
Here's your tooth.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.996
- You used my battle
instincts against me

17:45.098 --> 17:46.130
to defeat my tooth?

17:46.232 --> 17:48.166
- That's right.
You got Fizz whizzed.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.736
- Well done.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.671
And... and thank you.

17:53.773 --> 17:54.939
- You're welcome.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.174
Now about my office...

17:56.276 --> 17:57.909
- Don't make me
bite you again!

17:58.011 --> 17:59.477
- Ah!

18:08.054 --> 18:09.520
- Thanks.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.723
And, uh, I'm so sorry
Jimbo ate your ribs.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.928
- Hey, maybe Prudy
can smash through

18:17.030 --> 18:18.496
the rocks with
her hammer.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.231
- No, wait, this place
is too unstable.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.632
We could end up crushed.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.701
- The only way out is through
that hole in the ceiling.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.571
Luckily, the Wicks are known
for their jumpin' skills.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.106
Freedom!

18:28.208 --> 18:29.540
Yeah!

18:33.079 --> 18:35.246
Jumping is hard, guys.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.982
- You guys shouldn't
have come to rescue me.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.117
Now we're all trapped.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.785
- Of course,
we came for you.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.420
We're a team.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.089
- Then why did you let Jimbo
into your Cave of Hearts?

18:45.191 --> 18:46.557
- Well, we were just
buttering him up

18:46.659 --> 18:48.059
to convince him
to quit knight school.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.894
- Buttering up...
because he's a baker.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.730
Classic Ciara.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.032
- I'm sorry, guys.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.335
I guess I'm still getting
used to this whole team thing.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.403
- Well, none of
this will matter,

18:59.506 --> 19:01.272
if we don't find a way
out of this cave.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.977
- Oh, come on, cave.
Hold it in.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.548
- Wait, that's it!

19:10.650 --> 19:13.451
Prudy, lift that boulder
and put it over the geyser.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.619
- Got it!

19:23.863 --> 19:25.897
- The pressure's building.
This is bad.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.532
- No, it's just
what we need.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.567
- Yeah, combining
the power of the rock

19:29.669 --> 19:31.269
and the power
of the, uh...

19:31.371 --> 19:32.970
I have no idea
what the plan is.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.172
Keep talking.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.606
- If enough
pressure builds,

19:35.708 --> 19:37.575
it will launch it through
the hole in the ceiling.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.410
- Exactly! No, that's exactly
what my plan would have been,

19:39.512 --> 19:41.145
if I'd thought of it.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.548
- Everyone,
get on the boulder.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.253
- It's gonna blow,

19:49.355 --> 19:53.424
in three, two, one!

19:53.526 --> 19:54.425
One!

19:56.229 --> 19:58.629
- One?

19:58.731 --> 20:01.232
- Hm, I guess
it's not gonna...

20:05.004 --> 20:09.040
- And that is why you
do not high-five a falcon.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.875
- Just fist bump.
Got it!

20:13.680 --> 20:16.113
- Jimbo, where's the rest
of the Phoenix Squad?

20:16.216 --> 20:17.615
- I have horrible news.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.450
They were lost
in a freak accident...

20:19.552 --> 20:21.586
with their friend Arc.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.021
On the bright side,
I made popovers.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.690
- Arc's gone?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.024
Oh, well. Kripan!

20:28.294 --> 20:29.794
Back in.
- Yes!

20:40.306 --> 20:41.372
- Arc is back?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.341
Kripan!
You're back out.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.614
- Phoenix Squad,
what is going on?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.682
- Jimbo tried to trap
us in the Cave of Farts.

20:51.784 --> 20:55.119
- No, I left you to rot
in the Cave of Farts.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.921
Did you get a popover?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.990
- Guards, grab him!

20:59.092 --> 21:00.658
There's no place
in knight school

21:00.760 --> 21:02.393
for a student who
locks other students

21:02.495 --> 21:03.794
in a smelly cave.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.197
- Now what
about like a regular cave,

21:06.299 --> 21:08.666
like just...
- No cave!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.868
Guards, take him
to the dungeon.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.470
But, uh, leave...

21:12.572 --> 21:14.405
leave the popovers.
I'll handle these.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.642
- So, does this mean Arc can
rejoin the Phoenix Squad?

21:17.744 --> 21:19.176
- Only if he quits
Kraken Squad.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.778
- PRUDENCE, CIARA, WARWICK:
He quits!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.079
- What they said.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.451
- Kripan!

21:29.289 --> 21:30.388
Yes?

21:30.490 --> 21:31.856
- Stop crying.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.457
You're back in again.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.526
Yeah!

21:37.664 --> 21:39.797
- I think this
belongs to you.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.867
- And so does this.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.971
- Squad hug!

21:49.208 --> 21:51.409
- Ah, so this is
the Cave of Hearts.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.112
We should probably
all shower.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.881
- Yeah.
