00:02.578 --> 00:05.137
I was never a fan
until it occurred to me

00:05.138 --> 00:07.137
how much me and Ma'am have in
common.

00:07.155 --> 00:09.674
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:09.675 --> 00:12.436
And I know she's not a single parent
but she might as well be.

00:12.437 --> 00:15.995
Plus, the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns.

00:15.996 --> 00:17.496
Her, literally, sometimes,

00:17.531 --> 00:20.489
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.328
Admired and despised equally.

00:22.329 --> 00:24.690
Not for never lifting a finger - no!

00:24.691 --> 00:27.649
For setting examples
through extremity.

00:27.650 --> 00:30.448
And whether you're a bigwig
on her end, or a bigwig on mine,

00:30.449 --> 00:33.048
you've still got your dickheads
in the middle to deal with -

00:33.049 --> 00:34.808
snip-snip-snipping at your benefits.

00:34.809 --> 00:37.050
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking,

00:37.051 --> 00:39.009
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:39.010 --> 00:42.289
I got shot of my kids yonks back,

00:42.290 --> 00:44.688
whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:44.689 --> 00:47.770
Fine! I've had to get out of bed on
occasion to make ends meet,

00:47.771 --> 00:51.770
whereas she... She's done the whole
thing from a chair.

00:52.730 --> 00:54.370
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:54.371 --> 00:56.209
Oh, sure, there's perks.

00:56.210 --> 00:59.568
But, look at her lot - Brian May
prancing about on her roof.

00:59.569 --> 01:06.089
Now look at my lot - we know how
to throw a proper fucking paaaarty!

01:06.090 --> 01:12.976

01:13.010 --> 01:17.010
"Cheer up,
there's people worse off than you."

01:17.210 --> 01:21.089
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the single most

01:21.090 --> 01:25.090
useless piece of platitude anyone
can ever give you, ever.

01:25.410 --> 01:28.408
Cos it doesn't make you feel
any better, does it?

01:28.409 --> 01:30.568
All it ever does is make me
wonder

01:30.569 --> 01:34.570
where down this never-ending
line of 'worse off people' I fall?

01:34.850 --> 01:38.850
Of course there's people
worse off than me. So what?

01:39.170 --> 01:41.608
I don't want to be comparing
myself to them.

01:41.609 --> 01:44.128
I want to be
looking at the people above me.

01:44.129 --> 01:48.050
I want to be saying, "I'll have
some of what she's having, please."

01:48.051 --> 01:52.050
I want bumping up
the fucking list a bit.

01:52.170 --> 01:55.409
Is that too much to ask?

01:55.410 --> 01:57.409
Morning, love.

01:57.410 --> 01:59.489
Morning.

01:59.490 --> 02:02.369
Y'all right?
Ooh, like your jammies.

02:02.370 --> 02:06.370
Ta.

02:15.450 --> 02:18.529
I'll square you later.

02:18.530 --> 02:22.530
I know I might look like Geldof...!

02:29.730 --> 02:31.249
Oops!

02:31.250 --> 02:32.329
Hiya, love.

02:32.330 --> 02:36.330
Fuck's sake, Lillian!

02:40.850 --> 02:42.088
Where are you going?

02:42.089 --> 02:45.568
School. Problem with a teacher
letting the side down.

02:45.569 --> 02:48.928
The headmaster has personally
asked me to sort her out.

02:48.929 --> 02:50.208
How you going to do that?

02:50.209 --> 02:52.890
Tactfully. And if that don't work,
violent intimidation.

02:52.891 --> 02:55.289
Here y'are! Look what I've found.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.409
It's a feather.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.008
That's fucking good, that.

02:58.009 --> 03:02.010
See if you can learn the names
of some other things whilst I'm out.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.809
A party?

03:07.810 --> 03:11.408
A house warming for you and Letitia.
Thought it would be nice.

03:11.409 --> 03:15.410
And you're telling me now? This is
my 13th birthday all over again.

03:15.850 --> 03:18.848
I assume I can invite some of my
mates, since it is for me, an' all?

03:18.849 --> 03:22.208
If you like. Just thought you're
after meeting some new people.

03:22.209 --> 03:23.448
But of course you can.

03:23.449 --> 03:26.208
Thought we might make it
a girls'-own. What do you say?

03:26.209 --> 03:28.170
Mum. You could have done
a bit more bacon.

03:28.171 --> 03:30.609
I didn't have any more bacon.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.248
We're a little light
on grocery funds this week.

03:33.249 --> 03:35.210
That, and the stuff I bought for
the party...

03:35.211 --> 03:37.649
I never asked for a party!

03:37.650 --> 03:41.650
And I will sort out the
housekeeping. You'll have it Monday.

03:41.690 --> 03:43.768
Mary-Mae!
Don't embarrass your Auntie Avril!

03:43.769 --> 03:45.330
She doesn't want charity.

03:45.331 --> 03:49.330
Do you, Avril?
She's still got her dignity.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.928
Lillian, what are you blithering on
about? What's it got to do with us?

03:55.929 --> 03:58.608
I keep some money in there.
Did I not mention it?

03:58.609 --> 04:00.608
I probably should have
started with that.

04:00.609 --> 04:02.648
You keep the takings
in a railway locker?!

04:02.649 --> 04:05.648
Well, why shouldn't I?
They're very secure, them lockers.

04:05.649 --> 04:07.968
Probably that's why
the drug dealers use 'em.

04:07.969 --> 04:10.368
And that's probably why they're
always getting raided!

04:10.369 --> 04:13.768
You've got to help me, Kelly.
I can't go to prison with this face.

04:13.769 --> 04:17.447
I'd be catnip for all them lezzies.
I'd get it meself, but...

04:17.449 --> 04:19.809
- Yeah, how've you done that anyway?
- Boweling.

04:19.810 --> 04:20.689
Bowling?

04:20.690 --> 04:24.690
No, love - boweling!

04:46.410 --> 04:50.410
Right. You. A word.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.289
How much of a cut?

04:58.290 --> 05:01.208
Well, she reckons there's upwards
of three grand in there by now.

05:01.209 --> 05:02.569
She never counts it.

05:02.570 --> 05:06.168
Says we can have 200 for picking
it up. Cos of the risk.

05:06.169 --> 05:08.088
See, that's the bit that's
bothering us.

05:08.089 --> 05:12.010
You're as bad! Do you really think
someone's staking out the lockers?!

05:12.011 --> 05:16.010
Daft mare watched Bourne Ultimatum
on Sunday, that's all!

05:16.210 --> 05:19.530
This big raid of hers is probably
just one bloke and a sniffer dog.

05:19.531 --> 05:23.530
Right.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.730
I mean, I suppose
we could watch for a bit.

05:42.731 --> 05:46.730
Let's watch for a bit!

05:53.730 --> 05:57.130
Fuck's sake, you're a grown woman!
Pull yourself together.

05:57.131 --> 06:01.130
I don't want to be fired.
This job is all I've got!

06:03.530 --> 06:07.530
Well, Banbury told me you're one of
the best teachers the school's
ever had.

06:08.610 --> 06:10.729
So what happened?

06:10.730 --> 06:12.088
Cos from what I just saw...

06:12.089 --> 06:14.928
Year 5 could've been having
a Roman fucking orgy,

06:14.929 --> 06:17.250
and you wouldn't have batted
an eyelid.

06:17.251 --> 06:21.250
It's not that I don't care.
I do.

06:22.170 --> 06:24.810
It's just after everything
I've been through.

06:24.811 --> 06:26.729
Everything that's happened.

06:26.730 --> 06:30.730
What do you mean?
Why, what's happened?

06:32.490 --> 06:36.490
My husband left me.

06:37.490 --> 06:41.490
Open this door... right now.

06:50.930 --> 06:54.369
A feller?

06:54.370 --> 06:56.849
That's what this is about?

06:56.850 --> 07:00.850
A fucking feller?!

07:08.530 --> 07:09.730
He's been at it ages.

07:09.731 --> 07:12.729
It's like he's adjusting
a radio or summat.

07:12.730 --> 07:13.770
He's scratching his arse.

07:13.771 --> 07:15.729
No!

07:15.730 --> 07:17.569
Is he?

07:17.570 --> 07:19.850
He's getting fair stuck in, if he is.

07:19.851 --> 07:23.850
Sometimes you have to.

07:30.930 --> 07:34.729
Oh, for fuck's sake.
We're being as numb as she is.

07:34.730 --> 07:37.890
There's nobody watching them,
let's just get it over with.

07:37.891 --> 07:41.890
All right... Which one is it?

07:51.210 --> 07:53.089
What exactly are you doing?

07:53.090 --> 07:55.728
Trying to cover you,
so nobody can see what you're up to.

07:55.729 --> 07:58.089
- Do you know what it
looks like you're doing?
- What?

07:58.090 --> 08:02.090
Trying to cover me
so nobody can see what I'm up to!

08:02.730 --> 08:06.730
Got to do this sort of thing subtle.

08:11.730 --> 08:13.329
Shitting hell!

08:13.330 --> 08:15.809
Well, stand in front of us!

08:15.810 --> 08:19.009
Thought they'd be in a bag or
something.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.330
Did you? Good!
Cos I naturally assumed

08:21.331 --> 08:25.330
they'd be stuffed in like Paxo!
Fucking help us!

08:31.970 --> 08:34.087
What do you think? For the party?

08:34.089 --> 08:35.568
The party that's two days away?

08:35.568 --> 08:38.570
I just wanted to make sure it still
fits. And you know what?

08:38.571 --> 08:39.889
It does.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.849
It's nice.
I used to have one like that.

08:42.850 --> 08:45.169
Mine was red.

08:45.170 --> 08:48.290
No good for Monday though.
It's a DAYHOP party.

08:48.291 --> 08:52.289
"Dress As Your Husband Or Partner".
I'm sure I said?

08:52.290 --> 08:54.848
Parties have to have a theme
these days, Avril,

08:54.849 --> 08:56.248
It's not like back when...

08:56.249 --> 08:58.930
Well, back when you
last wore that dress.

08:58.931 --> 08:59.969
Hang on...

08:59.970 --> 09:03.249
Dress as your husband or partner?

09:03.250 --> 09:05.369
Oh, right...! Yeah.

09:05.370 --> 09:09.128
Well, let's just say if you don't
have a husband or partner you can...

09:09.129 --> 09:10.690
I don't know... Come as your dad?

09:10.691 --> 09:11.889
Excuse me?!

09:11.890 --> 09:15.890
Doesn't really matter,
just a bit of fun. Breaks the ice.

09:28.850 --> 09:32.850
You are not serious.

09:35.490 --> 09:40.642
Marty, is it just me, or did that
look like a lot more than four grand?

09:47.661 --> 09:50.181
Kind of exciting, though, weren't
it?

09:50.182 --> 09:53.300
We were like... Laverne and Shirley!

09:53.384 --> 09:55.303
Who?

09:55.304 --> 09:59.304
Is that not right?
Were they not the gangsters?

09:59.504 --> 10:00.703
Where's the milk?

10:00.704 --> 10:03.903
I dunno. Marty, come here, will you?

10:03.904 --> 10:07.904
I've counted 12 grand -
and that's just this lot.

10:08.088 --> 10:09.207
She's rich?

10:09.208 --> 10:12.287
Who knew, right?
I mean, not her, obviously.

10:12.288 --> 10:16.288
All she's expecting
is a couple of stacks.

10:16.888 --> 10:17.728
What are you saying?

10:17.729 --> 10:20.047
I'm not saying anything.

10:20.048 --> 10:23.607
Why? What did you think I was saying?

10:23.608 --> 10:27.608
I don't know.

10:29.208 --> 10:32.087
It smells like a bank, don't it?

10:32.088 --> 10:34.807
All them notes...

10:34.808 --> 10:38.128
all the hands that have touched
them, the places they've been.

10:38.129 --> 10:39.167
It does.

10:39.168 --> 10:43.168
There's something... sexual about
being in a bank, isn't there?

10:44.768 --> 10:46.447
Like libraries -

10:46.448 --> 10:49.567
the whole, "Look but don't
touch thing."

10:49.568 --> 10:53.568
It's a big tease.

10:57.368 --> 11:00.007
We're not in a bank, though.

11:00.008 --> 11:02.167
No...

11:02.168 --> 11:06.168
We can, touch it all we want.

11:06.888 --> 11:10.888
Wah!

11:19.808 --> 11:20.847
Hey!

11:20.848 --> 11:22.248
You been sat there all day?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.407
No... maybe.

11:24.408 --> 11:25.326
Been researching.

11:25.327 --> 11:27.166
Well, you can clear off out
for the evening

11:27.167 --> 11:28.408
cos I've got a dinner guest.

11:28.409 --> 11:29.767
What?! Who?

11:29.768 --> 11:30.807
Mrs Tattersall.

11:30.808 --> 11:32.688
Er, Twat-ersal? Is she still there?

11:32.689 --> 11:35.167
Mrs Twat-ersal, to you!

11:35.168 --> 11:39.168
And she's coming here for a home
cooked meal and advice of the heart.

11:39.808 --> 11:40.886
What, from you?!

11:40.887 --> 11:44.128
Yeah, from me!
I'm a very fucking caring person!

11:44.129 --> 11:45.607
Well... can't I stay?

11:45.608 --> 11:48.686
Oh, that's a good idea. Maybe you
could show her your feather?

11:48.687 --> 11:49.888
I could, couldn't I?

11:49.889 --> 11:53.367
She'll probably know what...

11:53.368 --> 11:57.368
Ha-ha, I get it.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.848
Party at mine. I mean, round
our Patreesha's but it's for me.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.047
Ladies only, I'm afraid.

12:07.048 --> 12:08.888
Karen, have you seen me glasses?

12:08.889 --> 12:10.687
No.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.888
"Dress As Your Husband Or Partner"?

12:12.889 --> 12:14.127
Not my idea.

12:14.128 --> 12:15.767
Sounds good.

12:15.768 --> 12:19.768
Hey, you finally get to see
me dressed up as you!

12:21.248 --> 12:25.248
Hope you brought enough.

12:25.288 --> 12:27.247
Lillian...

12:27.248 --> 12:28.287
here.

12:28.288 --> 12:29.488
What's all this about?

12:29.489 --> 12:32.487
Party on Monday.

12:32.488 --> 12:36.007
Ask some of the girls, if you like?

12:36.008 --> 12:38.407
Oh, thanks very much.

12:38.408 --> 12:39.648
Got a big family, has she?

12:39.649 --> 12:43.648
Yeah.

12:45.928 --> 12:49.167
Thank you so much for inviting
me round, Mimi.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.568
I was so sure the head
had sent you to fire me.

12:51.569 --> 12:53.087
Ha-ha!

12:53.088 --> 12:55.366
Do you know what they call
you in the staff room?

12:55.367 --> 12:56.648
What do they call me?

12:56.649 --> 13:00.648
Banbury's hit woman.

13:00.968 --> 13:03.688
So, do you not get out
much these days, then?

13:03.689 --> 13:05.687
Oh, no...

13:05.688 --> 13:09.688
me and Clive used to go out once
a month, for a meal...

13:10.768 --> 13:12.407
but now...

13:12.408 --> 13:15.047
I'm sorry.

13:15.048 --> 13:18.727
Eh, we'll have none
of that for a kick-off!

13:18.728 --> 13:21.567
Them kiddies need a good teacher...

13:21.568 --> 13:25.568
you need to get your
head back in the game.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.848
Get some scran down you...

13:29.888 --> 13:33.767
and then you and me will
go out for a few.

13:33.768 --> 13:36.007
Oh... I don't know...

13:36.008 --> 13:39.048
I've never been much for
that sort of thing.

13:39.049 --> 13:41.727
I find it hard to let myself go.

13:41.728 --> 13:43.048
Don't worry about that -

13:43.049 --> 13:47.048
stick with me, I'll make
a new woman of yer.

13:57.168 --> 13:58.967
This note...

13:58.968 --> 14:01.567
this one right here...

14:01.568 --> 14:03.407
I earned that for her.

14:03.408 --> 14:07.408
The things I did for that note -
for all of them...

14:08.048 --> 14:12.048
some people don't appreciate
what they've got.

14:14.928 --> 14:16.208
All right, I'll say it.

14:16.209 --> 14:17.647
Don't. Please, don't!

14:17.648 --> 14:19.767
- I've always wanted you
to have a better life...
- It's wrong!

14:19.768 --> 14:21.528
We could just get out of here - our
own place... our own actual home...

14:21.529 --> 14:23.767
She's a friend...

14:23.768 --> 14:24.886
She's more than a friend.

14:24.887 --> 14:27.526
She won't even know it's missing -
won't even know it's gone.

14:27.527 --> 14:30.527
- And, if you think about it,
it's a victimless crime.
- No!

14:30.528 --> 14:33.767
It's not, Marty.

14:33.768 --> 14:36.528
It's only victimless
if you don't think about it.

14:36.529 --> 14:40.528
Then we don't think about it.

14:57.288 --> 15:01.288
Black ball, there.

15:07.008 --> 15:08.247
Fucking hell!

15:08.248 --> 15:09.887
We used to have a table.

15:09.888 --> 15:12.648
I've never seen that before.
Did you see that?!

15:12.649 --> 15:14.247
So, Ches, fancy a game?

15:14.248 --> 15:17.568
Yeah - wouldn't mind trying
me luck with Hurricane Mae, here!

15:17.569 --> 15:20.527
Oh. OK. Sure.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.047
Go easy on us, yeah?

15:22.048 --> 15:24.606
I've never been here before.
Is this your local?

15:24.607 --> 15:27.646
I don't go out much.
I've never been in here before.

15:27.647 --> 15:29.127
- Hello, William!
- Sorry, Miss.

15:29.128 --> 15:33.047
I mean, you all right, Miss?

15:33.048 --> 15:34.008
Shall I join you?

15:34.009 --> 15:35.687
What do you think?

15:35.688 --> 15:39.688
If she was after a chimps tea party
I'd have taken her the fucking zoo.

15:43.488 --> 15:44.967
How did you do that?

15:44.968 --> 15:48.686
I could never even get him to stop
fiddling with himself in class!

15:48.687 --> 15:50.008
How do you know him anyway?

15:50.009 --> 15:53.127
Mimi, party on Monday,
if you're interested?

15:53.128 --> 15:55.807
Hello!

15:55.808 --> 15:56.887
Hello.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.808
She's with me. She's a teacher.

15:58.809 --> 16:02.207
Oh. Right.

16:02.208 --> 16:06.208
Ooh! Party!

16:06.568 --> 16:10.568
Ha-ha!

16:15.968 --> 16:19.527
Shane, look. I found this.
I think it's off a duck.

16:19.528 --> 16:23.247
Reckon it must be nesting
round here somewhere.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.088
Right. I tell you what - you see
if you can find some more,

16:26.089 --> 16:29.847
I'll organise a press conference.

16:29.848 --> 16:31.968
Dick.

16:35.608 --> 16:39.608
Shane!

17:05.008 --> 17:09.008
Y'know what? I want something a bit
classier, I'm with a teacher.

17:09.728 --> 17:12.646
I'll have a couple of them
Jagerbombs.

17:12.647 --> 17:16.127
There you go.
You get to dress up as your fella.

17:16.127 --> 17:18.967
Lucky me!
So, how's it going, anyway?

17:18.968 --> 17:20.846
I've moved in with my big sister.

17:20.847 --> 17:23.526
Not quite the way I envisaged
my life turning out.

17:23.527 --> 17:24.448
Tell me about it.

17:24.449 --> 17:25.887
Party!

17:25.887 --> 17:27.767
Girls only, Frank.

17:27.768 --> 17:29.248
What kind of party's that?

17:29.249 --> 17:33.248
The kind that involves
bras and panties,

17:33.648 --> 17:36.367
and pillow fights, of course.

17:36.368 --> 17:38.248
S'all right, I'll sit in
the corner quietly.

17:38.249 --> 17:42.248
You won't even know that I'm there!

18:08.208 --> 18:12.208
A victimless crime?

18:12.288 --> 18:16.288
Long as we don't think about it.

18:23.328 --> 18:26.407
All right, love?
What are you doing here?

18:26.408 --> 18:28.447
I went down the station.

18:28.448 --> 18:30.767
Oh, I'd forgotten all about that.

18:30.768 --> 18:33.367
Forgotten?

18:33.368 --> 18:35.847
Lillian, for fuck sake!

18:35.848 --> 18:38.847
You can't be this
casual about money.

18:38.848 --> 18:42.848
What you earn is more than some
people see in a life time.

18:43.928 --> 18:46.167
Means nothing to you, does it?

18:46.168 --> 18:50.007
And if you don't keep
track of it, people...

18:50.008 --> 18:53.207
people... might take advantage.

18:53.208 --> 18:53.848
Did you get it?

18:53.849 --> 18:57.848
Yes, I got it.

18:58.208 --> 19:01.567
Look, Lillian, I have to say...

19:01.568 --> 19:05.568
there was a lot more there
than you thought.

19:06.248 --> 19:10.248
Oh?

19:16.648 --> 19:20.648
4,000. Blimey!

19:22.688 --> 19:24.446
For you - and a little extra.

19:24.447 --> 19:25.488
Oh. No, Lillian...

19:25.489 --> 19:28.087
Please, please.

19:28.088 --> 19:32.088
Thank you.

19:39.808 --> 19:43.808
He said I'd changed,
I don't make the effort any more,

19:43.928 --> 19:45.927
he said I was like my mother.

19:45.928 --> 19:48.447
Bastard! That's what he is!

19:48.448 --> 19:49.846
Never used to be like that,

19:49.847 --> 19:53.848
never used to ask me to do those
sort of things in the bedroom!

19:55.288 --> 19:57.327
I like this song, what is it?

19:59.808 --> 20:03.808
I just miss him so much!

20:05.328 --> 20:07.246
How many of these have I had?

20:07.247 --> 20:09.408
We've only been here five minutes!

20:09.409 --> 20:13.408
Oh, I better get us some more then.

20:26.408 --> 20:28.407
Do I want to know?

20:28.408 --> 20:32.408
It's called educational
reconstruction.

20:33.168 --> 20:37.168
BARMAN!

20:45.968 --> 20:47.848
Off. I need to make that into a bed.

20:47.849 --> 20:51.647
We've got a house guest
for the weekend.

20:51.648 --> 20:52.687
Why?

20:52.688 --> 20:54.559
Cos I'm not done with her yet.

21:07.029 --> 21:10.829
So if that's OK with you, I'll pop
round and see you later then, love.

21:11.087 --> 21:15.086
See ya.

21:15.731 --> 21:19.731
Er, I mean... Goodbye, Miss.

21:20.491 --> 21:24.491
Always were an ill-mannered
little scrote, weren't you, Tutton?

21:30.131 --> 21:31.611
What have you done to her?

21:31.612 --> 21:35.050
Liberated her, Billy.
I've liberated her.

21:35.051 --> 21:36.451
But she's just like you now.

21:36.452 --> 21:40.451
So? I'm fucking liberated, aren't I?

21:53.851 --> 21:56.130
I don't wanna see it.

21:56.131 --> 21:57.950
What if someone comes round?

21:57.986 --> 21:59.264
Who's coming round?

21:59.265 --> 22:00.864
What if someone breaks in?

22:00.865 --> 22:03.026
No-one's going to break in.
Not round here.

22:03.027 --> 22:07.026
You don't steal from
your own, do you?

22:17.066 --> 22:19.506
We just want a better life.
That's all.

22:19.507 --> 22:21.305
That's not a crime, is it?

22:21.306 --> 22:24.185
No, Marty.

22:24.186 --> 22:27.985
Wanting something isn't a crime.

22:27.986 --> 22:31.785
But stealing 50 grand
from your best mate,

22:31.786 --> 22:35.786
I'd say that were pretty fucking
borderline, wouldn't you?!

22:38.226 --> 22:42.226
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

22:49.466 --> 22:53.466
It's all right,
it's all right, just a thingy.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.385
I want it gone.

22:57.386 --> 23:01.386
If it were gone, then...

23:01.546 --> 23:04.025
We should take it, take it all now,

23:04.026 --> 23:06.546
go down to the estate agent
and just...

23:06.547 --> 23:08.705
Just what?

23:08.706 --> 23:12.345
Jesus Christ, Marty!
What the fuck are we doing?

23:12.346 --> 23:14.384
We can't sort out
a mortgage with your

23:14.385 --> 23:16.424
barrow load of
spunk-stained notes.

23:16.425 --> 23:19.533
- Oh, no, they're all right,
I wiped myself off...
- Think, Marty!

23:20.786 --> 23:24.786
They're going to ask us questions,
like, "Where's it from?"

23:25.106 --> 23:27.025
Well...

23:27.026 --> 23:29.225
You launder it, don't you?

23:29.226 --> 23:30.665
Oh, do you now?

23:30.666 --> 23:31.865
Yeah!

23:31.866 --> 23:35.866
And what the fuck do
either of us know about that?!

23:36.706 --> 23:40.705
I can sort this.

23:40.706 --> 23:43.065
Kelly!

23:43.066 --> 23:47.066
Kelly!

23:47.746 --> 23:50.385
Mimi!

23:50.386 --> 23:51.225
Mimi.

23:51.226 --> 23:52.384
I'm in a bit of a rush.

23:52.385 --> 23:54.946
I only need a minute.
I wanted to ask a bit of a favour.

23:54.947 --> 23:56.185
Well?

23:56.186 --> 23:57.906
You see, it's a bit delicate.

23:57.907 --> 23:59.985
Up your fucking arse! Sorry.

23:59.986 --> 24:02.304
See, I reckon you could
be the one to help.

24:02.305 --> 24:05.504
Well? Spit it out before
you have a fucking stroke.

24:05.505 --> 24:08.986
Me and Kelly have come into
a bit of money. Ripped it off!

24:08.987 --> 24:10.305
You what?

24:10.306 --> 24:13.105
We need to make it coup de la.

24:13.106 --> 24:15.145
Clean, legit.

24:15.146 --> 24:16.506
You want to launder some money?

24:16.507 --> 24:18.585
Sh! Yeah.

24:18.586 --> 24:20.905
And I figured since you're a...

24:20.906 --> 24:23.625
Since I'm a what?

24:23.626 --> 24:25.145
A business woman.

24:25.146 --> 24:29.146
You calling me a fucking villain?

24:29.866 --> 24:30.705
No.

24:30.706 --> 24:32.305
I'm on the PTA, I am.

24:32.306 --> 24:36.306
I have respected pillars of the
community round for dinner.

24:36.426 --> 24:40.426
I wear dress suits!

24:40.626 --> 24:42.265
Can you sort it or not?

24:42.266 --> 24:43.306
Yeah, course I can.

24:43.307 --> 24:47.306
Good. Only not a word to anyone.

24:47.946 --> 24:51.105
Keep it on the down-low.

24:51.106 --> 24:54.865
Coup de la? Down-low?

24:54.866 --> 24:58.866
You two suddenly
Bonnie and fucking Clyde?

24:59.066 --> 25:00.745
That's them!

25:00.746 --> 25:04.746
Who the fuck are
Laverne and Shirley?

25:20.106 --> 25:23.906
Dressing up as our Brendan tonight,
need something to shove downstairs.

25:23.907 --> 25:27.906
Packed quite the
moose's knuckle, our Brends.

25:29.306 --> 25:32.265
20 Royals, please.

25:32.266 --> 25:36.266
Hiya, flower.

25:47.426 --> 25:50.425
Oh, very propitious.

25:50.426 --> 25:53.625
Still owe me for the milk, you know?

25:53.626 --> 25:56.505
Fucking here!

25:56.506 --> 25:57.626
And the sugar.

26:01.586 --> 26:05.586
That should be mine. Rent money.

26:08.226 --> 26:12.104
I tell you, I've been like a
whirling dervish all morning.

26:12.105 --> 26:14.986
I've even signed back up to
some of my old non-curriculars.

26:14.987 --> 26:16.065
Mmm.

26:16.066 --> 26:19.546
I feel like a new woman again,
I really do. It's like I'm...

26:19.547 --> 26:20.905
Liberated.

26:20.906 --> 26:22.785
Liberated, yes.

26:22.786 --> 26:24.465
Are you wearing make-up?

26:24.466 --> 26:25.545
No, Miss.

26:25.546 --> 26:28.385
Don't lie to me. Take it off now.

26:28.386 --> 26:31.064
Well, as I'm here,
I better stop at Banbury's,

26:31.065 --> 26:33.184
pick up the keys for the storeroom.

26:33.185 --> 26:35.624
Told him last week I'd keep
on top of supplies and that.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.826
Oh, there's no need.
I've already volunteered.

26:37.827 --> 26:41.545
Like I said, back to all
my old duties again.

26:41.546 --> 26:43.705
Supplies, admin, accounts.

26:43.706 --> 26:45.185
Good job as well,

26:45.186 --> 26:47.785
God knows who he had
doing the books.

26:47.786 --> 26:49.505
Full of holes, they were.

26:49.506 --> 26:51.545
You don't say.

26:51.546 --> 26:53.104
I'll give you a hand, then.

26:53.105 --> 26:55.304
Oh, I think I can handle it, Mimi.

26:55.305 --> 26:58.706
Besides, PTA shouldn't really do
this. It's more of a staff thing.

26:58.707 --> 27:02.706
Thanks for popping by.

27:05.026 --> 27:07.905
Y'alright? I brought you
some more bread.

27:07.906 --> 27:11.826
And don't worry,
I cut off all the mould.

27:19.146 --> 27:23.146
Nice one!

27:32.546 --> 27:34.146
Fuck d'you find this?

27:36.866 --> 27:38.465
No, no, no, no, no!

27:38.466 --> 27:42.466
Where are you?

27:50.226 --> 27:51.706
Shit!

27:55.546 --> 27:57.986
Fuck a duck!

28:03.346 --> 28:06.144
That's very good, Avril,
you look just like him.

28:06.145 --> 28:08.026
The grey in the hair's a nice touch.

28:08.027 --> 28:09.705
Who are you meant to be?

28:09.706 --> 28:12.104
My dad, apparently.
Who wasn't a cross dresser.

28:12.105 --> 28:13.784
These are his cabaret trousers.

28:13.785 --> 28:16.064
They were a bit long,
so I took 'em up a smidge.

28:16.065 --> 28:17.784
And by the way, Dad has a moustache.

28:17.785 --> 28:20.786
Actually, the last time I saw
him, he'd just shaved it off.

28:20.787 --> 28:23.625
And when was that exactly?

28:23.626 --> 28:25.706
- The last time you saw him?
- Mum!

28:26.866 --> 28:28.266
Get that will you, Avril?

28:28.267 --> 28:32.266
Bound to be one of yours
if they're this early.

28:39.386 --> 28:42.144
He saw the money.
I didn't know what to do!

28:42.145 --> 28:44.624
So you knocked him out?
With a plate?

28:44.625 --> 28:48.626
You can't go round knocking
people out with plates, Marty!

28:49.146 --> 28:52.105
Oh, and there was a duck in here too.

28:52.106 --> 28:55.186
It's all been go, really.

29:01.231 --> 29:02.531
No!

29:09.171 --> 29:10.509
We'll leave him by the Jacuzzi,

29:10.599 --> 29:13.720
smash a tile next to his head
or summat, I don't know.

29:13.721 --> 29:16.119
Numb sod'll think he dreamt it.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.320
Come on! Quickly!
Before he wakes up!

29:18.432 --> 29:19.831
Marty?

29:21.751 --> 29:22.590
Marty?

29:22.591 --> 29:25.509
Oh, yeah. She said she'd
help us move the money.

29:25.510 --> 29:28.311
- Forgot about that.
- Did you!

29:45.311 --> 29:48.950
You all right?

29:48.951 --> 29:51.390
15%, as discussed.

29:51.391 --> 29:52.830
You said ten before.

29:52.831 --> 29:56.710
And I might say fucking
20 in a minute.

29:56.711 --> 30:00.711
18.

30:06.391 --> 30:08.271
You know all these women, do you?

30:08.272 --> 30:09.790
Yeah.

30:09.791 --> 30:12.191
Are all their husbands
coppers, then?

30:12.192 --> 30:16.191
Apparently.

30:17.711 --> 30:21.711
Oh, excuse me.

30:25.727 --> 30:27.686
- Hiya!
- Hiya!

30:27.687 --> 30:29.086
All right?

30:29.087 --> 30:32.686
Now then. Oh, come on!

30:32.687 --> 30:34.407
Hey! I paid for you two up front!

30:34.408 --> 30:38.407
I'm not made of paper
towels you know!

30:39.287 --> 30:40.646
Jamie.

30:40.647 --> 30:43.366
Nicky.

30:43.367 --> 30:46.447
Now then, Yoko, John's not
about, I'll pass it on.

30:46.448 --> 30:50.447
Never joke about Lennon.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.085
I don't have those
sort of contacts any more.

30:57.086 --> 30:58.765
It's for Kelly and Marty.

30:58.766 --> 31:01.767
And for what we're charging 'em
you can make some new ones.

31:01.768 --> 31:05.767
I'm gonna check on Cilla.

31:08.007 --> 31:08.726
Contacts?

31:08.727 --> 31:10.047
Don't worry about it.

31:10.048 --> 31:11.526
Maybe I can help?

31:11.527 --> 31:14.126
Cleaning up some money, that's all.

31:14.127 --> 31:15.927
Like I said, don't worry about it.

31:15.928 --> 31:18.846
And like I said, maybe I can help.

31:18.847 --> 31:20.165
I thought you were on the level?

31:20.166 --> 31:22.005
There's levels and there's levels.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.487
You do realise this is...

31:23.488 --> 31:25.246
What do they need it for?

31:25.247 --> 31:27.206
To get a mortgage.

31:27.207 --> 31:31.207
There you go then. It's a bit of
white-collar fiddling, that's all.

31:31.887 --> 31:35.327
You think the suits on the top floor
aren't playing roulette with

31:35.328 --> 31:37.326
everyone's accounts?

31:37.327 --> 31:41.327
Why should it be just them?

31:41.487 --> 31:43.845
Look, we all have the same resources

31:43.846 --> 31:47.847
and if the Martys and the Kellys
want a slice and I can help,

31:48.167 --> 31:52.167
why not? It's practically
a public service.

31:52.927 --> 31:56.927
All right.

31:57.367 --> 32:01.367
Least I got her back down
to 16, So that's good.

32:03.207 --> 32:07.207
Why are we doing this, Marty?
Were we really that unhappy?

32:24.487 --> 32:25.647
This is all of it?

32:25.648 --> 32:29.647
Everything you kept back?

32:32.887 --> 32:35.886
We were unhappy, you know.

32:35.887 --> 32:39.486
Supposed to say we weren't. I know.

32:39.487 --> 32:43.487
Supposed to say we had each other,
and that's all that counted.

32:43.727 --> 32:47.446
Didn't matter
if we lived in a squat.

32:47.447 --> 32:51.447
Didn't matter if you made
a living sleeping with other men.

32:52.927 --> 32:55.527
That's what I'm supposed
to say, right?

32:55.528 --> 32:58.966
I-I guess so, yeah.
That's what your supposed...

32:58.967 --> 33:02.966
Well, I can't.

33:02.967 --> 33:04.886
I hate it.

33:04.887 --> 33:08.206
All of it.

33:08.207 --> 33:11.366
I hate living like this.

33:11.367 --> 33:13.566
I hate what you do.

33:13.567 --> 33:17.566
And I hate that I can't
make it better for you, cos...

33:17.567 --> 33:20.446
you deserve better. You do.

33:20.447 --> 33:23.646
We both do.

33:23.647 --> 33:26.087
And no-one's ever
going to give it us.

33:26.088 --> 33:30.087
Never.

33:36.047 --> 33:40.047
Everybody takes something, sometime.
Don't they?

33:40.247 --> 33:43.006
It's finally our turn.

33:43.007 --> 33:46.046
But I still need to do this.

33:46.047 --> 33:50.047
And then...

33:50.367 --> 33:54.367
and then we can be happy.

34:04.527 --> 34:06.606
# ..for just one second

34:06.607 --> 34:08.246
# You'd be back to bother me

34:08.248 --> 34:09.726
# Go on now, go

34:09.726 --> 34:11.446
# Walk out the door... #

34:11.447 --> 34:14.565
Fuck me! Billy, is that you?

34:14.567 --> 34:16.366
Yeah. Funny.

34:16.367 --> 34:20.246
"Dress as your husband". He's only
got two sets of fucking togs.

34:20.248 --> 34:23.926
Cheer up, you look good.
Anyway, your mate's here.

34:23.927 --> 34:26.406
Eh?

34:26.407 --> 34:28.286
# I will survive

34:28.286 --> 34:29.407
# For as long as... #

34:29.408 --> 34:31.326
She's proper good.

34:31.327 --> 34:33.085
Yeah, proper.

34:33.087 --> 34:35.045
# I've got all my life to live

34:35.045 --> 34:36.847
# And I've got all my love to give

34:36.848 --> 34:38.326
# And I'll survive

34:46.246 --> 34:49.485
Lillian.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.085
Going to the party. I'm our Brendan.

34:52.087 --> 34:53.366
You not going?

34:53.367 --> 34:55.085
The party? Clean forgot.

34:55.087 --> 34:58.205
I was just on me way
to see you, actually. See...

34:58.206 --> 35:00.685
when we picked up your money,
we carried it back in this

35:00.686 --> 35:03.085
rucksack and we were just
putting it away tonight

35:03.086 --> 35:06.527
and there's still some in the
bottom, underneath the flap thing?

35:06.528 --> 35:09.926
So we didn't see it.
But, anyway...

35:09.927 --> 35:12.846
here you are.

35:12.847 --> 35:16.846
Must be another two grand there?
Lucky, wasn't it?

35:16.847 --> 35:18.727
Glad I caught you anyway.
Enjoy the party.

35:18.728 --> 35:21.406
Was there any more?

35:21.407 --> 35:25.407
In the bottom of the bag.
Under the flap?

35:26.847 --> 35:30.847
Are you robbing us?

35:33.607 --> 35:36.085
Why didn't you fucking
count it, Lillian?

35:36.086 --> 35:38.967
You had no idea, had you?
Means nowt to you, does it?

35:38.968 --> 35:42.286
Practically fucking wallpaper.

35:42.287 --> 35:45.325
Do you know how many blowjobs
I would have to give to get

35:45.326 --> 35:49.327
even a twelfth of what you're just
stuffing away in railway lockers?

35:53.207 --> 35:57.207
We just want a better life.

35:58.847 --> 36:01.286
Say something.

36:01.287 --> 36:03.766
Shout at me, call me thieving cunt.

36:03.767 --> 36:07.366
Tell me how I've broken your heart.

36:07.367 --> 36:10.606
Say something!

36:10.607 --> 36:12.327
I don't think me and you's

36:12.328 --> 36:16.327
got anything to say to
each other any more. Do you?

36:19.527 --> 36:23.527
Lillian...

36:32.727 --> 36:34.926
# Dancing queen

36:34.927 --> 36:38.927
# Feel the beat
from the tambourine

36:42.647 --> 36:44.926
# You can dance

36:44.927 --> 36:45.967
# You... #

36:47.087 --> 36:50.565
What do you think you're doing?
She's your guest, let her sing.

36:50.566 --> 36:52.805
Yeah, she's my guest,
which is probably why you

36:52.806 --> 36:55.245
and your mates are stood over
there laughing at us.

36:55.246 --> 36:59.247
Laughing? It's called having a good
time, Avril. You should try it.

37:00.687 --> 37:04.326
If I wanted tea
in the zoo I'd have...

37:04.327 --> 37:07.766
fucked a chimp.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.046
More educational reconstruction?

37:10.047 --> 37:12.765
I'll give her fucking
reconstruction all right.

37:12.766 --> 37:14.445
That's another one gone, then.

37:14.446 --> 37:16.727
You don't half drive
'em away, don't you?

37:16.728 --> 37:18.966
Mates. Husbands...

37:18.967 --> 37:20.646
Oh, shut up!

37:20.647 --> 37:24.206
At least I don't strut
about like a...

37:24.207 --> 37:25.406
a black Cher!

37:25.407 --> 37:26.606
A what?!

37:26.607 --> 37:29.807
At least when I lose someone,
I leave them lost.

37:29.808 --> 37:33.807
Avril. He's not lost.
You know exactly where he is.

37:34.447 --> 37:37.487
I'm sure the brewery'll
give you that woman's address

37:37.488 --> 37:39.286
if you ask them nicely.

37:39.287 --> 37:43.287
She still works for 'em,
doesn't she?

37:49.413 --> 37:50.092
Hey!

37:50.093 --> 37:52.731
Fuck off. Your mum started it,
being a bitch.

37:52.732 --> 37:54.613
Don't you call my mum a bitch!

38:00.573 --> 38:04.092
Oh, God! Sorry, Mimi,
but dressed like that,

38:04.093 --> 38:06.293
for a second there
I thought you were our Clive.

38:06.294 --> 38:07.692
You what?

38:07.693 --> 38:09.373
How many of them you had?

38:09.374 --> 38:10.892
They're just herbal.

38:10.893 --> 38:14.492
See? You're the spit of him
in that tracksuit.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.131
Bastard. Do you know what I wish?

38:16.132 --> 38:19.533
I wish I'd had the guts to tell him
just what I thought
when I still had the chance.

38:19.534 --> 38:22.492
Make him sorry.
Make him say sorry.

38:22.493 --> 38:25.772
Then why don't ya? Tell me, I mean.

38:25.773 --> 38:29.252
If I look so much like
the twat, pretend I'm him.

38:29.253 --> 38:31.972
Get it all off your chest.

38:31.973 --> 38:35.973
And I'll respond as Clive.

38:56.253 --> 38:58.691
I always tried to be
a good wife but you never...

38:58.692 --> 39:00.731
A good wife?! Late home every night,

39:00.732 --> 39:04.733
wasting time staying on all hours
to do the school accounts, the admin!

39:05.013 --> 39:08.252
Not even thinking about my needs.

39:08.253 --> 39:12.133
About a man's needs. Any wonder
I start looking elsewhere, eh?

39:12.134 --> 39:14.732
A cook in the kitchen? My arse.

39:14.733 --> 39:16.611
Like a lump of dead
meat in the bedroom.

39:16.612 --> 39:19.571
Sitting around in your long
fucking nightie looking more

39:19.572 --> 39:22.573
and more like your pig ugly
mother every day.

39:22.574 --> 39:25.332
I'm sorry, Clive. I am.

39:25.333 --> 39:28.892
I-I can change,
I swear I can change.

39:28.893 --> 39:30.573
I'll even let you do that thing

39:30.574 --> 39:34.052
you wanted to try with
that dental chair you got.

39:34.053 --> 39:37.212
The what?

39:37.213 --> 39:39.893
Mimi?

39:41.213 --> 39:43.292
Right! That's it!

39:43.293 --> 39:47.293
Out! Everybody out!

39:54.013 --> 39:56.452
You miss him, don't you?

39:56.453 --> 40:00.453
I do. I really do.

40:00.573 --> 40:03.653
Then maybe you should go to him
and ask him to take you back.

40:03.654 --> 40:07.332
Don't be too proud to beg.
And I'll help ya.

40:07.333 --> 40:10.373
You won't have to work late any more,
give him more time.

40:10.374 --> 40:13.652
That's probably all he wants.

40:13.653 --> 40:17.653
And I'll take that silly
admin off your hands, yeah?

40:21.173 --> 40:23.892
Thank you, Mimi.

40:23.893 --> 40:27.893
It's a pleasure.

40:57.613 --> 41:01.613
How can I even look at her now?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.571
How can I look at anyone?

41:03.572 --> 41:05.733
But once the money's cleared,
once we're gone...

41:05.734 --> 41:08.652
And how long's that
going to take, Marty?

41:08.653 --> 41:12.653
Until then, I'm going to see her,
aren't I? Every...

41:16.173 --> 41:18.692
About this money of yours.

41:18.693 --> 41:22.693
What money?

41:23.013 --> 41:26.132
Fine, it's fine, it's all in hand.

41:26.133 --> 41:27.812
How long?

41:27.813 --> 41:31.813
I'll sort you out
a new credit history...

41:32.053 --> 41:35.092
should have a healthy
account by Friday.

41:35.093 --> 41:39.052
Friday? This Friday?

41:39.053 --> 41:43.053
You mean we can put ourselves down
for a mortgage this Friday?

41:43.093 --> 41:47.052
If that's what you want, then, yes.
You can do it.

41:47.053 --> 41:51.053
This Friday.

41:57.693 --> 42:01.133
So, basically she's returning
to a loveless marriage

42:01.134 --> 42:02.732
and an abusive husband?

42:02.733 --> 42:04.891
Sounds bad if you say it like that.

42:04.892 --> 42:07.653
Bottom line,
kiddies get a proper teacher again

42:07.654 --> 42:09.572
and I'm back in business.

42:09.573 --> 42:12.212
Everybody's happy.

42:12.213 --> 42:15.572
There'll always be
casualties, whatever.

42:15.573 --> 42:19.573
She should have paid more attention
to her feller, shouldn't she?

42:19.893 --> 42:22.772
If all you do is work, work, work,

42:22.773 --> 42:26.773
then he's bound to get
a wandering eye, isn't he?

42:31.173 --> 42:34.252
Mimi?

42:34.253 --> 42:38.253
You go on. I'm gonna head off home.

42:41.293 --> 42:44.492
A party over by 9pm.
I'll never live it down.

42:44.493 --> 42:46.372
No-one knew, you know.

42:46.373 --> 42:47.372
About her.

42:47.373 --> 42:50.013
Best out in the open.
Not good to keep pretending.

42:50.014 --> 42:51.332
Oh! Is that right?

42:51.333 --> 42:54.052
Yeah.

42:54.053 --> 42:56.052
Really not good.

42:56.053 --> 42:58.211
Do you know how much this
shirt cost?

42:58.212 --> 43:00.531
This really was like
your 13th birthday.

43:00.532 --> 43:03.771
You ruined my best top then, too.
Puked up all over it.

43:03.772 --> 43:05.533
Yeah, cos you spiked my coke.

43:05.534 --> 43:09.172
I hadn't. I just told you I did.

43:09.173 --> 43:10.852
You puked up anyway.

43:10.853 --> 43:14.853
You were dead funny,
so easy to wind up.

43:15.613 --> 43:19.613
Still are.

43:25.373 --> 43:29.373
Patreesh.

43:29.533 --> 43:31.772
How come you let us stay here?

43:31.773 --> 43:34.092
You're my sister.

43:34.093 --> 43:37.852
Plus, I thought it might be
a bit of company.

43:37.853 --> 43:41.732
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

43:41.733 --> 43:44.012
And...

43:44.013 --> 43:47.333
you know I said I'd have the
house-keeping by today, I can't...

43:47.334 --> 43:48.932
No rush.

43:48.933 --> 43:52.052
Er, our maths teacher
is asleep in the bath.

43:52.053 --> 43:53.092
Yeah!

43:53.093 --> 43:54.533
You're kidding!

44:03.053 --> 44:04.572
What you watching?

44:04.573 --> 44:08.573
Dunno.

44:13.533 --> 44:16.051
Look, I know I haven't been
round much of late.

44:16.052 --> 44:17.413
Are you wearing my track-suit?

44:17.414 --> 44:20.972
What? Oh. Yeah.

44:20.973 --> 44:24.973
What I'm trying to say is I had
things needed sorting, that's all.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.813
But it's done now.
So I'm gonna be here more.

44:28.814 --> 44:30.572
For you and Cilla.

44:30.573 --> 44:32.853
So I can talk to
you about stuff again?

44:32.854 --> 44:34.532
Oh, course you can.

44:34.533 --> 44:38.131
That's a relief. Cos I've got
something I really want to show you.

44:38.132 --> 44:40.133
It's not a dental chair, is it?

44:40.134 --> 44:44.133
What? No.

44:44.533 --> 44:48.052
You ready?

44:48.053 --> 44:49.812
Awesome, aren't they?

44:49.813 --> 44:51.452
Yeah, they're great.

44:51.453 --> 44:53.893
See the little skinny one?
I named that one after you.

44:53.894 --> 44:57.532
Oh, ta.

44:57.533 --> 45:01.412
I tell you what...

45:01.413 --> 45:05.413
let's go to the bedroom.

45:05.733 --> 45:09.492
We could be gone
by the end of the week.

45:09.493 --> 45:12.933
Can we be happy now?

45:15.973 --> 45:19.973
# Absolutely soaking wet! #

45:21.133 --> 45:25.133
'So, you people, you ones who
are supposedly worse off than me,

45:25.693 --> 45:29.693
'what would you give to crawl up
that list? Would you lie?

45:29.733 --> 45:32.131
'Would you steal?
Would you sell your soul?

45:32.132 --> 45:35.453
'My days down there are gone.
And maybe my soul is, too.

45:35.454 --> 45:36.892
'But so what?

45:36.893 --> 45:40.893
'Cheer up, Kelly, there'll always
be people worse off than you.

45:40.894 --> 45:43.412
'What's one more?'

45:43.413 --> 45:44.572
Kassi Blanco?

45:44.573 --> 45:46.371
Put your hands down
my pants. I dare you.

45:46.372 --> 45:48.651
You've dragged me into
this shit I wanna know about it.

45:48.652 --> 45:50.531
Just need somewhere to
lay low for a few days.

45:50.532 --> 45:53.891
We're looking for Dr Martin Fisher
and Kelly Ball.

45:53.892 --> 45:55.091
Wrong house, love.

45:55.092 --> 45:56.771
I want you two to do one, now.

45:56.772 --> 45:58.291
Fuck it, let's just go.

45:58.292 --> 46:00.371
You told your mum yet?
About them moving in?

46:00.372 --> 46:02.411
I'm just helping them out.
He's family.

46:02.412 --> 46:03.853
Not my fucking family!

46:03.854 --> 46:07.853
I'm gonna fuck you like
you've never been fucked before.
