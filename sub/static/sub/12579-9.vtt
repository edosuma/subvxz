[Tranquil instrumental music]

00:41.497 --> 00:44.432
Okay, I have narrowed it down
to one movie.

00:44.867 --> 00:48.359
We are seeing The Flowers of Time,
rated PG-13...

00:48.470 --> 00:51.337
by the
Motion Picture Association of America...

00:51.440 --> 00:53.704
and PG-12 by Peggy Hill.

00:53.809 --> 00:55.834
When I agreed to see a movie today...

00:55.944 --> 00:59.971
I assumed it was understood
that I meant not a ladies' picture.

01:00.282 --> 01:03.012
Hank, just because it takes place
on a rose farm...

01:03.118 --> 01:05.348
does not mean it's a ladies' picture.

01:05.453 --> 01:07.012
It doesn't help.

01:09.057 --> 01:10.524
[Car engine sputtering]

01:13.095 --> 01:16.064
Dang it!
She's been giving me trouble all week.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.131
First it was the distributor components...

01:20.235 --> 01:23.136
then I had to tweak
the carburetor's fuel-air mixture...

01:23.238 --> 01:26.071
Oh, for God's sake!
Just take it to a mechanic.

01:26.508 --> 01:30.968
Another man touching her all over,
playing with her manifolds?

01:31.079 --> 01:33.309
And then making Hank pay for it?

01:33.415 --> 01:35.576
- Don't tell me.
- You'll pay for it.

01:36.418 --> 01:39.945
Peggy, this truck has been through
four presidents...

01:40.255 --> 01:44.453
three Cowboy Super Bowl victories,
and zero mechanics.

01:49.298 --> 01:52.358
There she goes.
All right, everyone in, quick.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.000
To The Flowers of Time.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.339
$5 a ton if you feed it to pigs...

02:04.446 --> 02:06.812
and it's the exact same corn.

02:07.115 --> 02:10.015
And they said
nobody beats the claw machine.

02:11.286 --> 02:13.481
That's great, Son. Now give it to Connie.

02:13.589 --> 02:15.557
No. She won it for me.

02:23.565 --> 02:27.126
This is Charlton Heston
and Ethan Hawke's third movie together.

02:27.235 --> 02:29.795
The first two went straight to video.

02:34.910 --> 02:37.811
- Dale and I are the only guys here.
- No.

02:37.913 --> 02:41.246
There are two gentlemen right over there.
The ones with the mustaches.

02:41.350 --> 02:44.683
Hank, now look. That is a pillow sham.

02:46.855 --> 02:50.723
The only thing keeping you alive
is the pressure of the tractor.

02:50.826 --> 02:54.853
Son, I never really got around
to saying a lot of things.

02:56.832 --> 03:00.996
For being 106,
that man has a magnificent head of hair.

03:01.103 --> 03:02.400
Shush, sug'.

03:02.504 --> 03:06.440
This movie is good enough
to have been based on a novel. Hank?

03:09.144 --> 03:11.908
I won't make it to harvest this year, Son.

03:12.014 --> 03:14.915
Yes, you will. You have to.

03:15.417 --> 03:17.578
I am so proud of you...

03:17.686 --> 03:19.176
Nathaniel.

03:19.454 --> 03:23.390
You are my rose.

03:27.295 --> 03:28.262
[Crying]

03:28.363 --> 03:30.058
- Hank, are you crying?
- Nope.

03:30.799 --> 03:32.733
Just watching the movie.

03:32.934 --> 03:36.426
Hank, you're scaring me.
What the hell is going on?

03:36.571 --> 03:40.200
I'm okay.
Please continue to look at the screen.

03:40.509 --> 03:43.171
Hank Hill is weeping
like a little French girl.

03:50.485 --> 03:53.010
Come see what Channel 84 calls...

03:53.121 --> 03:55.817
'"a fragrant bouquet of human emotions. '"

03:58.894 --> 04:02.728
Oh, Hank, come on. There's no reason
to be ashamed about your crying.

04:02.898 --> 04:05.833
- But yet, I am.
- I wasn't crying.

04:06.368 --> 04:10.099
Coming from the heat of outdoors and
then into the air-conditioned theater...

04:10.205 --> 04:12.503
is naturally gonna cause
some condensation.

04:12.607 --> 04:17.202
Now, I am not a professional psychologist,
but I am an amateur psychologist.

04:17.546 --> 04:20.982
And I think
that this spontaneous eye-watering...

04:21.083 --> 04:24.177
may have something to do
with your father.

04:24.286 --> 04:27.449
Nope. It has nothing to do with anything.

04:27.556 --> 04:31.151
Well, think about it. You have
a strained relationship with your dad...

04:31.259 --> 04:33.819
and your greatest fear is that he will die...

04:33.929 --> 04:36.693
without telling you
how much he loves you.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.529
You are Ethan Hawke, Hank.

04:40.836 --> 04:42.463
That's just crazy talk.

04:42.571 --> 04:45.039
Our relationship is strained but fine.

04:45.140 --> 04:47.870
Wait. I don't know why I didn't see this.

04:47.976 --> 04:50.638
You're right. You are not Ethan Hawke.

04:50.746 --> 04:54.944
You are Charlton Heston.
Bobby is Ethan Hawke.

04:55.050 --> 04:58.315
- Yes. Done.
- No, it is not done.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.923
You and Bobby are very distant
emotionally and quite distant physically.

05:03.024 --> 05:05.686
And you know that if you were
ever pinned under a tractor...

05:05.794 --> 05:07.318
Bobby wouldn't be able to lift it...

05:07.429 --> 05:10.557
and you wouldn't be able to tell him
that you love him.

05:10.665 --> 05:14.999
- That, Hank, that is why you were crying.
- No.

05:15.103 --> 05:19.062
There is something wrong with my eyes.
Something seriously wrong.

05:19.341 --> 05:22.504
- Yep, that's it. Good night.
- Oh. Okay.

05:22.878 --> 05:25.904
So now you're the amateur doctor.
Interesting.

05:27.182 --> 05:29.116
Bill, knock-knock.

05:29.751 --> 05:31.480
- Who's there?
- Boo.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.554
- Boo who?
- "Boo-Hoo" Hank.

05:35.457 --> 05:39.223
Man, that is a good one.
Man, I got another one.

05:39.494 --> 05:43.954
What do you call the difference
between a man and a little squirt gun?

05:44.132 --> 05:46.362
- What?
- Hank.

05:50.672 --> 05:54.540
So, I forgot how long the straw was,
and it caught me in the eye.

05:54.643 --> 05:57.441
That was Sprite running down
my cheek, not tears.

05:57.546 --> 05:59.411
- Okay.
- Let's go, Hank.

05:59.514 --> 06:01.982
We have a 2:00
with an optician at the mall.

06:02.083 --> 06:03.311
He's not a doctor.

06:03.418 --> 06:07.878
But there is nothing medically wrong with
you, so it doesn't really matter, does it?

06:12.494 --> 06:16.555
How much longer would you say
you have to be this close to my face?

06:16.665 --> 06:19.725
I'm not really finding anything wrong
with your eyes, Mr. Hill.

06:19.835 --> 06:22.599
Just as I thought
and diagnosed yesterday.

06:25.740 --> 06:28.038
Are you ready to admit
you were crying, Hank?

06:28.143 --> 06:29.838
Or do we need to see a brain doctor?

06:29.945 --> 06:33.073
Because I will go right back in there
and get a referral.

06:33.181 --> 06:34.614
[Car engine sputtering]

06:39.154 --> 06:40.951
Okay, you were right.

06:41.590 --> 06:42.955
I am crying.

06:43.391 --> 06:45.450
- You happy now?
- Well, I'm...

06:45.594 --> 06:48.062
I'm happy for me, but I am sad for you.

06:48.163 --> 06:51.326
But, honey, I promise to keep this
between you, me, Bobby...

06:51.433 --> 06:54.561
and the family therapist
we will undoubtedly have to see.

06:55.871 --> 06:58.101
I'm not crying because of Bobby.

06:58.206 --> 07:01.733
Charlton Heston isn't me or Bobby.
Charlton Heston is...

07:03.211 --> 07:04.576
Is my truck.

07:07.148 --> 07:10.948
No, this is not because
of your truck, Hank.

07:11.086 --> 07:13.554
I think something's wrong with her.

07:14.389 --> 07:16.357
I checked this morning...

07:16.591 --> 07:19.287
and there was water in the exhaust.

07:22.731 --> 07:23.925
Oh, God!

07:28.837 --> 07:30.668
[Rock music playing]

07:35.243 --> 07:38.007
Mr. Hill, I'm afraid the news isn't good.

07:39.547 --> 07:44.007
She's only got about 500 miles left,
600 if you drive downhill a lot.

07:44.586 --> 07:47.919
- I'm just gonna close her up.
- You're not even gonna try to fix it?

07:48.023 --> 07:50.389
It would cost more to fix this truck
than it's worth.

07:50.492 --> 07:53.154
No, sir, I do not accept your answer.

07:53.328 --> 07:56.491
This truck has given me
20 years of reliable service...

07:56.598 --> 07:59.396
and you cannot put
a blue-book value on that.

07:59.501 --> 08:01.332
Now who's gonna tow me home?

08:07.042 --> 08:10.773
Hank's never gonna let this truck go,
and we're the ones who are gonna suffer.

08:10.879 --> 08:13.541
We will now be "rides to the Auto Zone"...

08:13.648 --> 08:16.310
and "those chumps
who will push my truck."

08:16.418 --> 08:18.978
You can't blame Hank
for being attached to his truck.

08:19.087 --> 08:21.920
He loves it. And that's what you do
when you love something.

08:22.023 --> 08:25.151
You cling to it
so it doesn't try to run away.

08:25.260 --> 08:27.558
I've had my van for 10 years.

08:27.662 --> 08:30.722
First sign of weakness,
I'll shoot her myself.

08:30.832 --> 08:32.663
[Car engine starts]

08:33.969 --> 08:35.732
Look, she's running.

08:35.837 --> 08:38.236
All I did was change the spark plugs...

08:38.340 --> 08:41.467
adjust the valve train
and rebuild the carburetor.

08:41.576 --> 08:42.907
She's purring like Eartha Kitt.

08:43.010 --> 08:43.977
[Imitating Kitt's purr]

08:46.181 --> 08:49.742
You got a dang old fire in the hole, man.
Ain't gonna do nothing but blow, man!

08:49.851 --> 08:53.014
No, nothing to worry about.
Probably just a leak in the fuel line.

08:53.121 --> 08:56.921
I'll just have to watch it
until the engine runs out of gas.

08:59.594 --> 09:00.561
Yep.

09:00.662 --> 09:02.630
- Yep.
- Mm-hm.

09:05.266 --> 09:06.233
Yep.

09:08.770 --> 09:09.794
All right, Bobby.

09:09.904 --> 09:14.204
I think the carburetor just needed
a little fine-tuning. Crank it gently.

09:14.309 --> 09:15.276
[Car engine starts]

09:20.915 --> 09:21.882
[Horn honking]

09:25.086 --> 09:29.022
Peggy, I know you said you'd divorce me
if I got rid of the Maverick.

09:29.124 --> 09:32.525
- So I hope you were kidding.
- Hank, it's beautiful.

09:45.807 --> 09:49.766
Hey, Dale, do you mind driving me over
to the Auto Zone?

09:49.878 --> 09:52.745
I'm just gonna break down
and buy a new carburetor.

09:52.847 --> 09:54.678
And so it begins.

10:01.823 --> 10:03.723
Sorry I'm almost late, sir.

10:03.825 --> 10:07.192
I tried that new left-turn lane on Fourth.
It was okay.

10:07.295 --> 10:08.922
Yeah, yeah. I need you, Hank.

10:09.030 --> 10:11.498
Clark Mobile Homes is threatening
to cancel their account.

10:11.599 --> 10:15.933
Oh, God! They have a heated pool
and communal barbecue pits.

10:22.911 --> 10:24.469
What the...

10:25.146 --> 10:29.708
I mean, what seems to be the problem
with Mr. Clark?

10:29.818 --> 10:32.981
It seems Enrique's been
short-filling their tanks.

10:33.088 --> 10:36.683
- Why would he do that?
- Well, I told him to.

10:41.429 --> 10:44.489
Cripes almighty! It's hot in here!

10:45.300 --> 10:46.494
Really?

10:47.001 --> 10:50.300
I was just thinking
it was a little chilly, actually.

10:54.342 --> 10:56.503
Now, someone's lying to me.

10:57.145 --> 10:58.544
Let's see.

10:58.646 --> 11:02.173
Is it the girl in Accounting, my daughter?

11:02.851 --> 11:04.375
Or you fellows?

11:08.590 --> 11:10.080
Scout's honor, Roy.

11:10.191 --> 11:13.888
If Hank says those tanks were filled,
by God, those tanks were filled!

11:13.995 --> 11:17.089
Actually, sir, if you recall,
what I said was...

11:17.732 --> 11:19.927
Whoo-ee! I don't like to get this sweaty...

11:20.034 --> 11:23.094
lessen I have a, you know,
little lady to towel off on.

11:29.244 --> 11:30.575
We lost the account, didn't we?

11:31.179 --> 11:32.942
So I raised my hand and said:

11:33.047 --> 11:35.982
"Mrs. Donovan, I think I speak
for the whole class...

11:36.084 --> 11:40.180
"when I say the homework load
has been a little heavy lately."

11:40.622 --> 11:42.522
And the class erupted.

11:45.026 --> 11:47.756
Bobby was in the middle of a great story.

11:47.862 --> 11:50.695
- Start again, Bobby. Lots of energy.
- Okay.

11:51.065 --> 11:53.625
It was a day like any other...

11:53.735 --> 11:54.929
Here's a story for you.

11:55.036 --> 11:58.130
I've had a long day
and I lost a big account...

11:58.239 --> 12:02.039
and I don't have the energy
to listen to any stories. The end.

12:04.579 --> 12:07.548
Bobby, honey, it is not because
he doesn't love you.

12:07.649 --> 12:10.174
I know. It's because of his truck.

12:10.285 --> 12:13.152
Well, that is
what he keeps saying anyway.

12:13.254 --> 12:16.485
But what I think would really
help your father "fix his truck"...

12:16.591 --> 12:19.617
is for the two of you
to spend some good time together.

12:19.727 --> 12:21.319
Fixing his truck?

12:21.496 --> 12:23.726
It doesn't matter what you do, Bobby.

12:23.831 --> 12:25.458
No. Wait, honey.

12:25.567 --> 12:28.900
Don't tell him any more
of those boring school stories, okay?

12:34.709 --> 12:37.200
Hey, Dad. Need an extra set of hands?

12:37.312 --> 12:40.110
That is not a toy, it's for lying down on.

12:46.788 --> 12:48.221
Dang it, Bobby!

12:48.323 --> 12:52.885
People are gonna see this oil stain
and think I'm a drunk. Now clean it up.

13:00.068 --> 13:02.434
"We perform miracles
at Pick-Up Truck Heaven."

13:02.537 --> 13:05.267
So I called and told them
the transmission's shot...

13:05.373 --> 13:08.604
and the engine mounts are rusty,
and it was catching fire a lot...

13:08.710 --> 13:11.110
and they said, "No problem."

13:11.713 --> 13:14.147
This place is all the way in West Durndell.

13:14.549 --> 13:18.713
I'm not gonna drive my truck 40 miles
on some magic-carpet ride...

13:18.820 --> 13:22.586
so some jackass mechanic can tell me
there's nothing he can do.

13:23.658 --> 13:24.955
Come on, Dad.

13:25.059 --> 13:29.758
Your truck drove you to the hospital when
you cut your toe with a weed-whacker.

13:29.864 --> 13:32.264
You owe it to her to at least try.

13:35.236 --> 13:37.898
And you owe it to Bobby
to take him along.

13:38.006 --> 13:40.634
After all, this is his brilliant idea.

13:40.742 --> 13:44.439
I wish I could take credit for it.
Oh, I did buy the newspaper.

13:45.647 --> 13:47.205
BOBBY: I'm not sure.

13:47.315 --> 13:50.341
The address is either 1523...

13:50.451 --> 13:52.646
or 1528.

13:53.054 --> 13:56.717
It says,
"Look for the giant inflated gorilla."

13:58.159 --> 13:59.524
BOBBY: Is that it?

14:04.365 --> 14:08.233
Hello. I am Marty Mendez.
You must be Mr. Hill.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.837
I recognized your truck
from your son's description.

14:10.938 --> 14:12.530
You have my condolences.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.973
- Tell me, Marty, what do you recommend?
- A new truck.

14:25.386 --> 14:28.150
You're not a mechanic at all.
You're a salesman.

14:28.256 --> 14:29.848
I am the salesman.

14:29.957 --> 14:32.391
Salesman of the Month, March '98.

14:32.493 --> 14:35.690
I'm sure I mentioned that to your son.
I'm very proud of it.

14:35.797 --> 14:37.287
How could you?

14:37.498 --> 14:39.762
Eighty-four miles I'll never get back.

14:39.867 --> 14:43.462
It's not all my fault.
Mom did buy the paper.

14:43.671 --> 14:46.037
I'm as mad at her as you are.

14:50.144 --> 14:51.611
[Car engine sputtering]

14:55.383 --> 14:56.611
Come on.

14:59.153 --> 15:01.018
Bobby, take the wheel.

15:09.997 --> 15:11.862
I can't push it myself.

15:12.567 --> 15:14.865
She's too solidly manufactured.

15:18.606 --> 15:20.437
[Train approaching]

15:21.209 --> 15:24.201
Stop making train noises. It's not funny.

15:24.445 --> 15:27.039
Dad, it's not me. I think there's a...

15:27.181 --> 15:28.648
[Bell ringing]

15:32.487 --> 15:35.320
Bobby, get away from the tracks, now!

15:42.497 --> 15:43.930
Dad, leave it!

15:51.305 --> 15:53.773
Stop! Someone's on the tracks!

15:54.041 --> 15:55.906
Stop the train! Stop!

15:59.947 --> 16:00.914
No!

16:13.928 --> 16:17.523
So that's what it sounds like
when a train hits a truck.

16:17.632 --> 16:20.123
It was a little more trucky
than I would have thought...

16:20.234 --> 16:22.464
considering how much train there was.

16:22.570 --> 16:25.300
This is all your fault. You killed my truck.

16:25.406 --> 16:27.340
I was just trying to help.

16:27.442 --> 16:30.434
And if it wasn't the train,
it would have been something else.

16:30.545 --> 16:33.878
That mechanic said
it only had 500 miles left.

16:34.749 --> 16:37.183
Even if he was right, which he wasn't...

16:37.285 --> 16:41.278
if I only drove 5 miles a year,
I could have had her another 100 years.

16:44.892 --> 16:46.484
We should have asked for a lift.

16:49.397 --> 16:52.798
You just sit here
and try not to break any more trucks.

16:58.239 --> 16:59.228
You're back.

16:59.340 --> 17:02.468
Save your fancy come-ons
for the Okies, okay?

17:02.743 --> 17:05.075
I told you before, I'm not interested.

17:05.179 --> 17:08.410
And none of your song and dance
is gonna change that.

17:09.150 --> 17:10.708
Believe me, it would.

17:10.818 --> 17:12.877
Now, as long as you have come back...

17:12.987 --> 17:15.785
I feel I must tell you
that this bad boy comes...

17:15.890 --> 17:19.451
with a sunroof and seat-warmers
in its standard package.

17:19.760 --> 17:23.526
Well, sounds great.
Let me just put on a dress and hop on up.

17:23.998 --> 17:27.398
- Look, I just need a phone.
- There's one in the truck.

17:27.801 --> 17:29.702
I'm just being honest with you.

17:29.804 --> 17:32.364
I'm just gonna use the pay phone
in the showroom.

17:32.473 --> 17:34.771
Bobby, I'll just be a minute.

17:38.012 --> 17:39.138
Bobby?

17:41.782 --> 17:46.048
You looking for a little kid
about this big by this big?

17:46.387 --> 17:48.218
- He said he's walking home.
- What?

17:48.322 --> 17:52.190
- Why didn't you try to stop him?
- Looked like he could use the exercise.

17:52.293 --> 17:54.022
Red or green, honey?

17:55.162 --> 17:57.153
Well, I give up.

17:57.265 --> 17:59.233
I don't know if it was you or the truck...

17:59.333 --> 18:02.734
but I need to test-drive this beauty
right now.

18:02.837 --> 18:04.065
I knew it.

18:04.171 --> 18:07.072
It feels like March '98 all over again. Yes.

18:24.892 --> 18:27.326
Excuse me, I'm looking for my son.

18:27.428 --> 18:30.397
A kid came running by,
asking for directions to Arlen.

18:30.498 --> 18:31.487
That's him.

18:31.599 --> 18:34.568
I pointed him north on Mariposa,
but he went west on Travis.

18:34.669 --> 18:36.330
The way I pointed.

18:38.306 --> 18:39.671
Okay, west.

19:02.897 --> 19:03.989
Bobby?

19:12.373 --> 19:16.241
Anti-lock brakes.
That's why they didn't lock.

19:42.637 --> 19:47.370
You can do it, Bobby. Only 39 miles to go.

20:01.222 --> 20:02.883
Bobby, quick. Get in.

20:02.990 --> 20:06.585
I'm fine, thank you. I am walking home.

20:07.728 --> 20:10.663
Bobby, you got tired
on the drive over here.

20:11.265 --> 20:14.723
Look, Bobby, I'm sorry I blamed you
for killing my truck.

20:14.835 --> 20:19.067
- I know it wasn't intentional.
- Well, you're damn right it wasn't!

20:19.173 --> 20:22.142
You think you're the only one
who loved that truck?

20:22.243 --> 20:25.303
I spent the best years of my life
in that truck.

20:25.646 --> 20:27.580
You did love my truck?

20:29.316 --> 20:32.308
I'm sorry I never got a chance
to tell her that.

20:32.420 --> 20:34.888
Come on. Why don't you climb on up?

20:36.891 --> 20:38.722
It's got seat-warmers.

20:39.860 --> 20:41.828
My butt is kind of numb.

20:44.665 --> 20:46.758
Hey, I got my own airbag...

20:47.535 --> 20:49.264
and a vanity mirror.

20:49.570 --> 20:51.970
I look pretty sweet in this truck.

20:54.141 --> 20:56.200
I found this by the tracks.

20:56.977 --> 20:59.844
You know,
maybe she died there for a reason.

21:00.448 --> 21:02.916
Like she was trying to tell you something.

21:03.050 --> 21:07.851
Like, "Go back to the dealership
and buy a new truck.

21:08.122 --> 21:11.148
"It's okay. I'm in a better..."

21:11.859 --> 21:13.952
And then the train hit her.

21:15.096 --> 21:17.462
Yeah, maybe you're right.

21:17.565 --> 21:21.797
Maybe she is looking down on us
right now, from pick-up truck heaven.

21:22.169 --> 21:24.034
You know, the real one.

21:27.074 --> 21:30.339
Oh, man! There's something in my eye.

21:31.345 --> 21:34.075
Yeah, it's the new-car smell.

21:34.715 --> 21:36.273
It's very strong.

21:36.450 --> 21:40.113
- I love this truck.
- Yeah, me, too.

21:40.621 --> 21:44.352
But when we get back to the dealership,
pretend you hate it.

22:21.428 --> 22:23.988
BOBBY: To The Flowers of Time.
