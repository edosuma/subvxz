00:00.838 --> 00:02.791
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:02.916 --> 00:05.274
for the murders of
14 young women.

00:05.399 --> 00:08.686
I have so many
surprises waiting for you.

00:09.421 --> 00:10.461
Hello?

00:10.523 --> 00:12.528
Mom? I want to go home.
Why can't I come home?

00:12.625 --> 00:13.617
I'm gonna come get you.

00:14.673 --> 00:15.901
Joey!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.040
They were able to find a
signal in upstate New York.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.248
Jacob Wells.
Paul Torres.

00:20.397 --> 00:21.750
Hey, guys.
This is Megan.

00:21.927 --> 00:23.102
I thought you were
gonna deal with this.

00:23.215 --> 00:24.345
Paul's the one
that brought her here.

00:24.436 --> 00:25.757
Jacob's never killed anyone.

00:25.794 --> 00:27.034
I think you should
do it, Jacob,

00:27.065 --> 00:28.117
since you never have.

00:28.216 --> 00:29.210
If you want to see Joey,

00:29.319 --> 00:31.521
be at the corner
of Broad and 26th Street.

00:31.828 --> 00:33.434
If you want to see Joey,
get in now.

00:33.648 --> 00:35.048
I won't say it again.

00:35.556 --> 00:37.085
This is Hank.
Roderick sent him.

00:37.184 --> 00:39.925
We need to get out of here, guys.
10 minutes.

00:42.099 --> 00:43.565
Megan.

00:43.719 --> 00:44.689
Shh, shh, shh.

00:44.807 --> 00:46.880
Hey, Joey.
I'm a friend of your mom's.

00:46.977 --> 00:48.483
She sent me to come
take you home.

00:48.646 --> 00:51.079
Do not move.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.771
Hand over your weapon.

00:58.109 --> 00:59.793
- It's okay, Joey.
- Go to your room, Joey.

00:59.899 --> 01:01.374
Yeah. You heard what he said.
Go to your room.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.184
- Where's Denise?
- Go to your room now!

01:03.290 --> 01:04.828
Do what he says.
Go to your room.

01:11.106 --> 01:13.224
Now turn around, slowly.

01:15.021 --> 01:16.165
I can do that.

01:18.188 --> 01:19.873
Over there by the chair.

01:30.437 --> 01:33.188
- Now what?
- Shut up. Let me think.

01:34.841 --> 01:37.114
- It's Ryan.
- Yeah, I know who he is.

01:39.194 --> 01:40.889
- Where's Joey?
- He's upstairs.

01:41.005 --> 01:42.771
- Where's Hank?
- He's in the barn.

01:42.961 --> 01:44.212
He's dead.

01:44.489 --> 01:45.801
There's a dead cop, too, but

01:45.912 --> 01:46.745
there's probably
more on the way.

01:46.898 --> 01:47.721
We gotta get out of here.

01:47.844 --> 01:48.894
Let's all just stay calm.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.149
This isn't a calm situation.

01:50.259 --> 01:51.168
This is freak time.

01:51.303 --> 01:52.583
Damn it, Jacob,
hold it together.

01:52.592 --> 01:54.840
He's right, Emma. There'll
be others any second.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.371
Who else knows we're here?

01:57.352 --> 01:58.941
Just me.

01:59.403 --> 02:00.952
And the FBI.

02:01.633 --> 02:03.499
Local police, state police,

02:03.605 --> 02:07.903
US Marshals, SWAT, ATF, HRT.

02:08.030 --> 02:09.640
I'm sure I'm
forgetting someone.

02:10.596 --> 02:12.196
But this is the end.

02:13.552 --> 02:17.121
None of you
are making it out of here.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.920
Not alive, anyway.

02:39.315 --> 02:40.428
Let's go.

02:45.185 --> 02:46.201
Where are we?

03:30.355 --> 03:32.500
I was told that I would see my son.
Where is he?

03:34.102 --> 03:35.893
I asked you a question.

03:39.071 --> 03:40.573
Say something!

03:42.105 --> 03:43.687
I don't want to
hurt you, Claire.

03:44.363 --> 03:46.026
Don't make me hurt you.

03:59.287 --> 04:00.527
House sits
a ways from the road.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.191
It's just beyond
that tree line.

04:03.219 --> 04:04.961
Hey. Doing good.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.799
Just hang in there.
How big is the property?

04:07.817 --> 04:10.200
4 acres.
Mostly fields and woods.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.927
Chief, Lopez is dead.

04:13.112 --> 04:15.398
He's what? How?

04:15.521 --> 04:16.610
We don't know the details.

04:16.721 --> 04:18.382
He was with Ryan Hardy.

04:21.457 --> 04:23.484
Hey. Hey. I'm sorry
about Officer Lopez,

04:23.605 --> 04:25.590
but I need you to focus, Chief.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.762
I need all of your men
here now, okay?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.495
Feds are on their way
with SWAT and HRT,

04:29.604 --> 04:30.620
but we need to guard
the perimeter

04:30.739 --> 04:32.710
so no one can leave
that property before then.

04:35.930 --> 04:37.830
Where's Ryan Hardy now?

04:38.199 --> 04:39.209
Last time I spoke to him,

04:39.321 --> 04:40.924
he was headed inside the house.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.641
I found this.

04:46.673 --> 04:48.064
So, tie him up.

04:53.780 --> 04:55.563
- What's wrong?
- He's looking at me funny.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.341
- Do it.
- Yeah, Jacob.

04:58.043 --> 04:59.385
Do it.

04:59.494 --> 05:02.430
Come on.
Do it.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.840
The second you get
within two feet of me,

05:06.962 --> 05:09.223
I'm gonna snap your neck
and crack your spine.

05:09.336 --> 05:11.221
- I'll shoot you dead.
- And his spine will be cracked.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.976
- And you'll be dead.
- And his spine will be cracked.

05:16.063 --> 05:18.111
- He's bluffing.
- How do you know that? Huh?

05:18.347 --> 05:20.903
He's FBI.
He knows this stuff.

05:21.010 --> 05:23.807
Yeah, Paul.
I know that stuff.

05:25.829 --> 05:27.093
What was that?

05:27.188 --> 05:28.562
My cell phone.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.040
- Want me to answer it?
- No.

05:30.176 --> 05:32.128
Give it to me.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.153
Take it.

05:39.716 --> 05:42.512
Put it on the table
and step away.

06:02.615 --> 06:05.691
I'm too nervous to sit.
That's all.

06:14.509 --> 06:16.666
How much longer
before I see my son?

06:16.795 --> 06:19.090
Soon as I have an ETA,
you'll know.

06:30.778 --> 06:32.760
How do you know Joe?

06:33.603 --> 06:35.127
We met through friends.

06:38.846 --> 06:40.607
I can easily slice into
the prison library servers

06:40.775 --> 06:42.238
and create a separate server

06:42.383 --> 06:44.038
that piggybacks
on what's there.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.299
They'll never know.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.639
It's very similar
to the covert systems

06:46.768 --> 06:47.949
we had in Baghdad, sir.

06:48.039 --> 06:49.711
How long were you
in the army for?

06:49.939 --> 06:53.415
6 years. 4 tours in
Baghdad, two in Kandahar.

06:53.533 --> 06:56.238
I was a corporal in the cyber
surveillance team, sir.

06:57.153 --> 06:59.496
But you were discharged?

07:02.258 --> 07:04.421
Psychiatric discharge?

07:08.814 --> 07:11.393
There's no judgment
here, Charlie.

07:11.530 --> 07:15.450
No disgrace in serving
your country.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.518
How many people
have you killed?

07:21.664 --> 07:23.906
Nine, sir.
3 terrorists,

07:24.023 --> 07:26.105
two Iraqi soldiers,
and 4 others.

07:26.226 --> 07:28.349
The other 4?
Who were they?

07:31.696 --> 07:33.750
People I wanted dead, sir.

07:33.934 --> 07:38.620
Well, you are handy
to have around.

07:41.289 --> 07:42.825
Did Roderick explain
what it was

07:42.954 --> 07:43.995
I'd like you to do?

07:44.133 --> 07:46.036
Yes, sir. And I'm
incredibly grateful

07:46.167 --> 07:47.951
for the opportunity.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.321
What's all this for?

08:25.457 --> 08:27.124
You've been watching me.

08:32.063 --> 08:34.028
You don't have to be
afraid of me, Claire.

08:34.342 --> 08:37.775
It's not my intention to hurt you.
You have to trust me.

08:39.534 --> 08:42.352
Why would I ever trust you?

08:42.851 --> 08:45.024
Because I'm your follower.

08:51.385 --> 08:52.418
Could I sit down?

08:52.572 --> 08:54.255
- Yeah.
- No! What--

08:54.365 --> 08:55.895
I mean, no.

09:03.034 --> 09:04.249
So, Paul's in charge, huh?

09:04.367 --> 09:06.546
No. Nobody's
in charge.

09:06.649 --> 09:07.545
Well, that would explain a lot.

09:07.665 --> 09:08.915
Hey, you shouldn't
be such a smartass

09:09.049 --> 09:10.096
with a gun in your face.

09:10.197 --> 09:11.721
Yeah, probably not.

09:13.897 --> 09:14.823
How's Joey?

09:14.918 --> 09:16.039
I gave him his special milk.

09:16.105 --> 09:17.332
He'll be asleep in 10 minutes.

09:17.438 --> 09:18.627
You drugged him?

09:18.780 --> 09:20.282
Why isn't he tied up?

09:20.561 --> 09:23.623
What is that?
I heard sirens.

09:23.935 --> 09:25.742
It's the cops.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.414
What are they doing?

09:27.529 --> 09:29.209
They're letting you
know you're surrounded.

09:29.246 --> 09:31.710
I told you-- none of you
are getting out of here.

09:32.663 --> 09:33.868
The same goes for you.

09:33.992 --> 09:35.527
Yeah, well, I'm okay with that,

09:35.662 --> 09:37.263
because I know you're
not gonna hurt Joey

09:37.292 --> 09:39.787
and I know the FBI's
not gonna hurt him,

09:39.915 --> 09:42.507
so I'm okay with anything else.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.954
Really? You smug--

09:47.062 --> 09:48.583
Oh, be careful!

09:49.183 --> 09:51.761
Aah!

09:52.699 --> 09:53.846
What's going on with him?

09:53.958 --> 09:55.123
It's the electric current.

09:55.267 --> 09:57.500
It interferes with
his pacemaker.

09:57.877 --> 09:59.288
He'll be okay.

10:00.381 --> 10:01.747
By the way...

10:04.634 --> 10:06.190
Joe's idea.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.891
Now tie him up!

10:18.910 --> 10:20.773
The FBI arrived earlier today

10:20.904 --> 10:22.994
to assist local authorities
with the capture

10:23.134 --> 10:26.120
of 3 suspects with ties
to Joe Carroll.

10:26.207 --> 10:28.004
Now, sources claim that
these accomplices

10:28.127 --> 10:32.293
are holding Carroll's son
hostage inside the farmhouse.

10:40.771 --> 10:42.643
Okay. Bring me
up to speed.

10:42.780 --> 10:43.955
Ryan's still inside
with the suspects.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.067
We can't confirm a number

10:45.081 --> 10:46.596
or the whereabouts
of Joey Matthews.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.637
We have tapped into
the house's server.

10:52.774 --> 10:54.135
They're trying to
e-mail somebody.

10:54.248 --> 10:55.959
Looks like it went to wi-fi,
then bounced to satellite.

10:56.070 --> 10:57.440
This is happening from
inside the farmhouse?

10:57.563 --> 10:58.662
Yeah, no, this is
happening right now.

10:58.762 --> 10:59.943
I can grab this.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.138
Here it comes.
I got it.

11:02.926 --> 11:04.652
It's encrypted.
Damn it!

11:04.761 --> 11:06.037
Did anybody else get that?

11:06.410 --> 11:07.386
No.

11:07.514 --> 11:08.837
Come on.

11:12.571 --> 11:15.284
Joey's sleeping.
What are you doing?

11:15.393 --> 11:16.507
I e-mailed Roderick.

11:16.629 --> 11:18.492
I told him about Hank
and Ryan Hardy.

11:18.593 --> 11:19.819
We need more help.

11:19.974 --> 11:21.148
I am trying to be
tough here, Jacob,

11:21.268 --> 11:24.162
but we are in trouble,
and I don't know what to do.

11:24.290 --> 11:25.875
Roderick sent Hank.

11:27.277 --> 11:29.558
What if he doesn't
send anybody else?

11:30.737 --> 11:33.051
Let's just wait to see
if he answers.

11:33.618 --> 11:35.456
We're gonna get out of this.

11:37.949 --> 11:40.080
We're gonna figure this out.

11:41.264 --> 11:42.796
Okay?

12:01.294 --> 12:03.934
So. What's the latest
update?

12:04.065 --> 12:05.161
I don't have much to
report, other than

12:05.285 --> 12:06.919
Ryan Hardy is now
at the farmhouse

12:07.049 --> 12:08.646
in Dutchess County.

12:09.211 --> 12:10.180
And Claire?

12:10.359 --> 12:11.282
She went missing earlier today

12:11.412 --> 12:13.359
from a restaurant
on Broad Street.

12:13.489 --> 12:15.428
She appears to have
taken your advice.

12:15.563 --> 12:17.752
No one can find her.

12:17.984 --> 12:19.618
Hm heh.

12:19.732 --> 12:21.954
I think it's time to
know what I'm a part of.

12:22.486 --> 12:24.387
What is this all about?

12:24.687 --> 12:27.526
Do you really want me
to answer that, Olivia?

12:27.652 --> 12:29.266
That will make you complicit

12:29.390 --> 12:31.640
if, for instance, you knew

12:31.791 --> 12:33.260
that your statement
to the press

12:33.462 --> 12:35.620
triggered a plan that incited

12:35.745 --> 12:37.057
the abduction of my wife.

12:37.229 --> 12:38.629
That would make
all sorts of trouble

12:38.636 --> 12:41.095
both for you and your career.

12:41.232 --> 12:44.439
You don't want me
to answer that.

12:44.572 --> 12:46.250
Do you?

12:47.583 --> 12:49.179
No.

12:50.935 --> 12:52.973
Keep me updated.

13:02.395 --> 13:04.138
You're gonna make a phone call.

13:05.020 --> 13:07.408
No, thank you.
You do it.

13:07.543 --> 13:08.855
No, you're gonna do it.

13:08.995 --> 13:11.133
You tell those cops
out there to retreat.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.018
I don't want a cop or anyone

13:13.131 --> 13:14.183
coming near this house.

13:14.303 --> 13:17.981
Or what?
You need leverage.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.595
I'm good for nothing.
You can kill me

13:19.713 --> 13:21.730
and I don't care.

13:23.039 --> 13:25.162
Eventually.
But I thought we'd start

13:25.280 --> 13:26.963
with our little friend
in the basement.

13:28.461 --> 13:29.999
Have you met Megan?

13:35.387 --> 13:38.456
Hey, stop, stop, okay, okay.

13:38.561 --> 13:40.493
Thought that would do it.

13:47.116 --> 13:48.998
About that call.

13:53.189 --> 13:55.989
Okay, so, I see 6 entrances, but only 3
access points. Is that correct?

13:56.068 --> 13:57.502
Yes. We've got
the roads blocked.

13:57.616 --> 13:58.656
What about aerial support?

13:58.758 --> 13:59.646
I need choppers in the air.

13:59.771 --> 14:01.590
Got choppers on standby
from Poughkeepsie PD.

14:01.703 --> 14:02.579
What's Turner saying?

14:02.703 --> 14:04.743
They put an APB out to local
authorities in Virginia

14:04.804 --> 14:06.739
for Claire Matthews, but there's
no trace on her cell phone.

14:06.866 --> 14:08.144
And what about Olivia Warren?

14:08.268 --> 14:09.489
What's she told Claire?

14:09.603 --> 14:10.779
She's not talking.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.367
She knows something.

14:12.482 --> 14:14.351
We're moments away from
rescuing Carroll's son

14:14.495 --> 14:16.718
and he orchestrates a
move on his ex-wife?

14:16.819 --> 14:18.061
His lawyer's
helping him coordinate a plan

14:18.175 --> 14:19.860
and I want to know what it is.

14:20.635 --> 14:21.875
It's Ryan.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.134
Pick it up.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.821
Ryan, it's Weston.
How are you?

14:31.943 --> 14:33.167
Cozy as can be.

14:33.293 --> 14:35.132
I'm sitting here
with my 3 new friends

14:35.257 --> 14:37.256
and a pretty girl named Megan.

14:37.466 --> 14:38.926
Megan Leeds, the missing girl

14:39.050 --> 14:40.173
from the grocery store.

14:40.277 --> 14:41.389
What about Joey Matthews?

14:41.495 --> 14:43.675
Well, they're kind of
mad at me right now,

14:43.795 --> 14:45.114
so I probably
shouldn't tell you

14:45.229 --> 14:46.586
that he's asleep upstairs.

14:46.707 --> 14:49.400
What are you doing?
Tell them to back off.

14:49.513 --> 14:52.424
Excuse me, is that
Emma Hill I'm hearing?

14:52.862 --> 14:55.127
Emma? This is
Agent Debra Parker.

14:55.252 --> 14:56.258
How are you?

14:56.383 --> 14:57.262
Say hi.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.505
Is there anything
you guys need?

14:58.617 --> 14:59.806
Can we get you anything?

14:59.911 --> 15:02.521
We want this to come to a
safe resolution for everyone.

15:02.649 --> 15:04.049
Then get the hell out of here.

15:04.096 --> 15:06.757
Have your men retreat or
I will kill Megan Leeds,

15:06.902 --> 15:08.743
and then I'll start on
Ryan Hardy.

15:08.846 --> 15:09.940
Do you understand?

15:10.059 --> 15:11.382
We copy.

15:11.719 --> 15:13.428
Nice art, by the way.

15:14.337 --> 15:16.197
- What?
- At your house.

15:16.446 --> 15:18.007
In the attic, the murals
on the ceiling.

15:18.104 --> 15:21.083
The women-- Lenore,
Annabel Lee.

15:22.358 --> 15:24.149
You're a very talented artist.

15:24.270 --> 15:25.511
What do you think you're doing?

15:25.615 --> 15:28.232
I used to draw
when I was young.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.599
I gave it up.

15:29.893 --> 15:31.562
But what I like
about your work is that

15:31.681 --> 15:34.848
all of the faces
resemble your mother.

15:40.275 --> 15:42.307
Is that negotiator talk?

15:42.437 --> 15:45.028
It won't work, lady.
I killed my mother.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.614
I know.
Most of us only

15:46.742 --> 15:48.717
dream about doing it.

15:48.856 --> 15:50.675
There have been so many times

15:50.787 --> 15:52.707
I've wanted to whack my mom.

15:53.543 --> 15:55.160
You must miss her.

15:55.272 --> 15:57.186
Your art suggests you do.

15:57.693 --> 15:59.986
I know I miss my
mother all the time.

16:00.094 --> 16:01.593
Screw you.
You know nothing.

16:01.706 --> 16:04.276
Actually, I know more
than you may think.

16:06.650 --> 16:09.348
Hey. They're just trying to
get under your skin, okay?

16:09.468 --> 16:10.417
Just shake it off.

16:10.516 --> 16:11.651
I'm fine. Okay?

16:11.805 --> 16:13.469
I'm gonna check
our e-mail.

16:15.779 --> 16:17.839
It's okay.
Just go with her.

16:19.056 --> 16:20.707
You're sleeping with Emma?

16:21.419 --> 16:23.670
Wait. You two
aren't gay?

16:24.833 --> 16:27.285
I'm not gay.

16:27.723 --> 16:30.303
What about you? Gay?

16:30.524 --> 16:31.997
Shut up.

16:44.616 --> 16:46.941
Hey. What was
all that about?

16:47.085 --> 16:50.585
SWAT and HRT
are still an hour out.

16:51.328 --> 16:52.977
I was trying to...

16:53.466 --> 16:56.339
stall whatever it is
they may be planning to do.

16:58.348 --> 17:00.266
Is it true about her art?
It's of her mom?

17:00.385 --> 17:04.146
Every single painting,
mural, sketch

17:04.269 --> 17:05.711
looks like her mother.

17:06.355 --> 17:08.501
I suspect she is

17:08.691 --> 17:11.329
completely traumatized
by having killed her.

17:11.449 --> 17:12.614
Why unravel her?

17:12.739 --> 17:17.069
I'm trying to bring her
grief to the surface.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.997
A reminder she's human.
She has a conscience.

17:20.964 --> 17:22.169
It might make her
rethink the choice

17:22.282 --> 17:24.219
she's about to make.

17:25.643 --> 17:27.976
Sounds like her mother
did a number on her.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.814
Mine sure did.

17:30.978 --> 17:33.212
Parental influence defines us.

17:59.407 --> 18:01.335
Hello, Debra.

18:02.889 --> 18:06.506
Look at you.
You're all grown up.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.133
Hello, Dale.

18:17.146 --> 18:18.728
I came to see my family.

18:18.856 --> 18:23.940
It's been 15 years.
Why now?

18:24.077 --> 18:26.310
Because it's been 15 years.

18:26.435 --> 18:28.673
What makes you think
they'd want to see you?

18:30.128 --> 18:32.246
After what you've done.

18:50.066 --> 18:54.898
Debra.
Don't be afraid, child.

19:10.431 --> 19:11.762
Shh.

19:14.755 --> 19:15.892
No.

19:16.378 --> 19:18.964
No... Aah!

19:39.962 --> 19:44.691
Hello, mom, dad.

19:57.394 --> 19:58.813
Any word?

19:59.174 --> 20:01.041
- They've been delayed.
- By the FBI?

20:01.199 --> 20:04.506
I don't know. I'm still
looking into it.

20:04.628 --> 20:05.929
We'll have to be patient.

20:06.052 --> 20:08.021
Patient? He was never
coming, was he?

20:08.142 --> 20:10.300
No. He's coming, Claire.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.214
That's the plan. You're gonna
be reunited with your son.

20:13.325 --> 20:14.701
Yeah, and then what?

20:14.812 --> 20:17.012
There are certain things
I can't tell you.

20:17.123 --> 20:18.723
That's one of them.

20:23.886 --> 20:25.179
What did you mean

20:25.301 --> 20:27.724
when you said
you were my follower?

20:32.883 --> 20:34.860
I've been watching you, Claire.

20:35.695 --> 20:37.264
These are my notes.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.189
- I'm very thorough.
- My God.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.806
All the data's been
entered into the system.

20:41.928 --> 20:42.953
For how long?

20:43.058 --> 20:44.707
Two years.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.425
There's more.

20:49.676 --> 20:51.902
It's important for Joe
to share your life.

20:52.004 --> 20:53.534
Why?

20:53.708 --> 20:54.764
He loves you very much.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.681
He loves me?
He tried to kill me.

20:56.802 --> 20:57.990
He doesn't want you to die.

20:58.100 --> 21:00.268
He's hoping very much
you'll survive this.

21:20.047 --> 21:21.921
You filmed this?

21:23.557 --> 21:25.289
Did Denise-- or Emma.
Whatever her name is.

21:25.433 --> 21:26.552
Did she know?
Did she know about this?

21:26.682 --> 21:27.888
No. I knew about her,

21:28.011 --> 21:29.650
but she didn't know about me.

21:29.754 --> 21:31.544
Joe didn't want her involved.

21:31.651 --> 21:35.025
Everyone plays their
own part, Claire.

21:36.177 --> 21:38.018
You're my part.

21:41.580 --> 21:42.681
Roderick wrote back.

21:42.798 --> 21:44.158
Is he sending more help?

21:44.522 --> 21:46.308
He doesn't say.
He said he'll contact us

21:46.432 --> 21:47.850
soon on the satellite phone.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.681
Shut down all
online correspondence.

21:49.797 --> 21:51.277
It's no longer secure.

21:51.495 --> 21:53.059
That's all he said?

21:53.821 --> 21:55.364
He said for us to be ready.

21:55.478 --> 21:57.203
Ready for what?

22:07.231 --> 22:08.768
They're backing off.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.766
Where's his phone?

22:14.923 --> 22:16.200
What are you doing?

22:16.346 --> 22:18.684
We need to delay things
until Roderick calls.

22:19.119 --> 22:20.738
I thought I could let
the FBI help with that.

22:20.862 --> 22:21.840
Where's Jacob?

22:21.949 --> 22:22.943
He's checking on Joey.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.876
How's he doing with everything?

22:25.978 --> 22:27.358
What do you mean?

22:27.518 --> 22:28.950
You know what I mean.

22:29.572 --> 22:31.015
With us?

22:33.327 --> 22:36.000
So not the time, Paul.

22:38.779 --> 22:41.072
Oh, wow.
This is interesting.

22:41.197 --> 22:44.542
So, you're sleeping
with Emma, too?

22:44.896 --> 22:46.182
Or just Jacob, or both?

22:46.318 --> 22:47.978
You have no idea
what's going on.

22:48.085 --> 22:48.943
Yeah, you're right.
I don't,

22:49.072 --> 22:50.472
because in my head,
I got this whole

22:50.601 --> 22:52.821
three-way scenario
going on here...

22:52.965 --> 22:57.126
You like Jacob but
Jacob likes Emma.

22:57.249 --> 23:00.481
Emma just wants
to control you both, but--

23:00.685 --> 23:02.371
that can't be it.
Can it?

23:02.490 --> 23:06.068
I mean-- come on.
Really?

23:12.026 --> 23:14.595
Parker. Ryan's phone.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.059
You have Agent Parker.
Who is this?

23:21.942 --> 23:23.499
It's Emma.

23:24.021 --> 23:26.841
Hello, Emma. What
can I do for you?

23:28.840 --> 23:32.933
You're right.
I do miss my mother.

23:34.404 --> 23:36.730
You did not call me
to tell me that.

23:36.856 --> 23:37.856
What's going on in there?

23:37.857 --> 23:39.332
Why are you playing with me?

23:39.467 --> 23:41.944
She was slutty, my mom.

23:42.249 --> 23:44.950
She brought guys home
all the time,

23:45.400 --> 23:47.985
especially during
my formative years.

23:48.201 --> 23:52.015
I could hear them
in her bedroom.

23:52.340 --> 23:53.508
Is that why you killed her?

23:53.663 --> 23:55.509
I killed her to be free.

23:56.816 --> 23:58.676
She tried to make me
something I'm not.

23:58.803 --> 24:01.707
Yes, parents do
like to control us.

24:01.843 --> 24:04.569
Not anymore. Nobody
tells me what to do.

24:04.687 --> 24:06.155
Except Joe.

24:07.262 --> 24:09.578
- I make my own choices.
- How so?

24:09.706 --> 24:13.302
I mean, didn't you just replace
one parent with another?

24:13.420 --> 24:14.445
How's it different?

24:14.563 --> 24:16.308
Aren't you only doing
what Joe wants?

24:16.431 --> 24:19.658
I chose Joe.
He was my choice.

24:19.983 --> 24:21.759
We cannot choose our parents,

24:21.894 --> 24:23.301
but we can break free of them,

24:23.436 --> 24:25.716
and that's what I did.

24:26.774 --> 24:29.329
Emma? Emma!

24:34.072 --> 24:35.850
You've come a long way.

24:36.084 --> 24:37.581
I've missed you.

24:38.008 --> 24:40.070
It's been so long.

24:40.659 --> 24:42.787
I wanted to know how you are.

24:42.921 --> 24:45.088
You never should have
left, Debra.

24:45.210 --> 24:46.294
I didn't belong here.

24:46.422 --> 24:48.069
That's not true.

24:48.351 --> 24:50.160
You had great potential.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.221
I could talk to the council.

24:53.354 --> 24:54.591
They might take you back.

24:54.706 --> 24:57.402
No, dad. That's
not why I'm here.

24:58.156 --> 24:59.983
Then why are you here?

25:01.055 --> 25:03.153
You're my parents.

25:03.439 --> 25:06.530
I wanted to see you.
We're family.

25:08.184 --> 25:09.356
Agent Parker.

25:10.655 --> 25:14.425
Emma's stalling. Did
you track that e-mail?

25:14.542 --> 25:15.892
No. Still trying.

25:16.011 --> 25:18.480
They've contacted someone.
They're buying time.

25:21.868 --> 25:22.923
Where's Emma?

25:23.065 --> 25:24.055
She's in the kitchen.

25:24.179 --> 25:25.433
So, Jacob,

25:25.541 --> 25:27.806
how's the whole
three-way thing work?

25:28.380 --> 25:30.353
You told him?

25:31.361 --> 25:32.974
I called that.
Not bad, huh?

25:33.103 --> 25:34.901
He's running his mouth.
Don't listen to him.

25:35.026 --> 25:36.426
Well, I mean,
it makes sense, right?

25:36.448 --> 25:38.837
Because you're posing as a
gay couple for that long.

25:38.934 --> 25:41.084
Sooner or later,
you gotta put out.

25:41.722 --> 25:45.339
Hey-- hey. Don't listen to him.
Let him talk.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.172
I know you love Emma.

25:47.294 --> 25:48.908
For the love
of God, you people.

25:49.042 --> 25:50.289
Shut your mouth!

25:50.411 --> 25:51.877
You want me to kill
that girl? Huh?

25:51.994 --> 25:53.417
Nobody thinks that I can.

25:53.562 --> 25:55.024
Guys, guys, stop!

25:55.163 --> 25:56.403
Okay, don't shoot, don't shoot!

25:56.427 --> 25:57.635
You need to sit down.

25:57.756 --> 26:00.388
Jacob. Jacob, take--

26:00.870 --> 26:02.736
just keep it together.

26:02.842 --> 26:04.157
All right? Just
keep it together.

26:16.221 --> 26:18.407
Hey. I got something.

26:18.526 --> 26:20.313
I unscrambled an e-mail
sent on their server.

26:20.431 --> 26:22.231
"What's your ETA?
I have Claire."

26:22.349 --> 26:23.453
Sent from a warehouse
in Richmond.

26:23.566 --> 26:24.658
It's gotta be Claire Matthews.

26:24.763 --> 26:25.926
Get Turner on
the line immediately

26:26.033 --> 26:27.232
and give him a location.

26:27.698 --> 26:28.646
SWAT is here.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.372
Good. Let's get
you guys in position.

26:30.461 --> 26:31.336
Just give us the word, ma'am,

26:31.448 --> 26:32.759
and we'll take that
house, no problem.

26:32.878 --> 26:34.631
I want the child safe first.

26:34.751 --> 26:36.567
I got two well-trained
sharpshooters.

26:36.691 --> 26:38.322
And I've got a child,
an innocent girl,

26:38.449 --> 26:39.424
and one of my agents in there.

26:39.517 --> 26:40.838
Can you guarantee me
their safety?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.982
Guarantee? No, ma'am.

26:43.087 --> 26:44.682
Okay, then.
Get your men in position

26:44.800 --> 26:46.447
but stand down until
I tell you otherwise.

26:46.557 --> 26:47.447
I'll go on site with SWAT.

26:47.556 --> 26:49.182
I'm going, too.
I know the property.

26:58.691 --> 27:01.223
Yeah, it's me. I need
to speak to Roderick.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.758
I haven't heard from Hank.

27:04.047 --> 27:06.572
No, nothing. I don't
have the boy.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.044
Are you sure? Don't
doubt me, Roderick.

27:09.196 --> 27:10.317
I can do this.

27:10.444 --> 27:12.389
I still have her
without the boy.

27:17.342 --> 27:18.660
What do you want me to do

27:18.772 --> 27:20.172
with Claire Matthews?

27:50.276 --> 27:52.366
Don't do this, Claire.

28:09.032 --> 28:10.125
Aah!

28:10.309 --> 28:11.759
Don't do that again.

28:21.045 --> 28:22.748
In position.
All clear.

28:35.246 --> 28:36.509
Be right back.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.386
Must have been
an important call.

28:50.327 --> 28:51.930
We're good.
Everything's cool.

28:52.062 --> 28:52.930
What-- what does
that mean?

28:53.067 --> 28:54.049
What-- what are we
supposed to do?

28:54.184 --> 28:55.105
Keep it together, Paul.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.590
Just sit tight
a little while longer.

28:56.660 --> 28:57.620
I'm gonna check on Joey.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.977
- What's going on here?
- Relax!

29:01.690 --> 29:04.305
Have a little faith, Paul.

29:06.563 --> 29:09.582
Yeah, Paul. Place is
surrounded by cops.

29:09.718 --> 29:13.805
All the roads are closed.
No way out but--

29:14.339 --> 29:16.217
have a little faith.

29:31.755 --> 29:33.932
Hey, there, sleepy head.
Wake up.

29:34.451 --> 29:36.990
Wake up.
Wake up.

29:37.733 --> 29:38.744
What's going on?

29:38.869 --> 29:40.305
Come on.
I gotta go.

29:40.423 --> 29:42.566
Come on. There you go. Come on.

30:03.234 --> 30:06.942
I'm sorry I ran off.
I got scared.

30:07.111 --> 30:08.288
I heard you say
something was wrong,

30:08.416 --> 30:09.616
and I just wanted to get away.

30:09.723 --> 30:10.754
I mean, if Joey's
not coming here,

30:10.871 --> 30:12.180
then why can't I go home?

30:12.299 --> 30:14.667
That was never
the plan, Claire.

30:17.494 --> 30:19.859
What is the plan, Charlie?

30:20.004 --> 30:22.135
There are certain things
I can't tell you.

30:22.741 --> 30:24.711
You tell me who Roderick is?

30:26.263 --> 30:27.477
Can't tell you that, either.

30:27.597 --> 30:29.196
That's not his
real name, is it?

30:29.317 --> 30:31.286
The main character in "The
Fall Of The House Of Usher"

30:31.427 --> 30:33.126
by Edgar Allan Poe, wasn't it?

30:33.246 --> 30:34.590
All I can tell you

30:35.097 --> 30:37.183
is that he's a friend of Joe's.

30:38.385 --> 30:40.377
What is Joe doing?

30:41.752 --> 30:45.187
Hmm? Why do you
listen to him?

30:49.134 --> 30:51.462
What is this all about?

30:53.643 --> 30:57.125
He's teaching me
to feel my life.

30:57.845 --> 30:59.998
Claire worked all week.
She went to he doctor.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.637
She took Joey
all over the place--

31:01.774 --> 31:03.096
soccer, piano.

31:03.213 --> 31:05.137
She went to a Celine Dion
concert on Friday

31:05.252 --> 31:06.429
with her friend Lisa.

31:06.573 --> 31:10.140
Celine Dion?
Oh, good God.

31:10.246 --> 31:12.564
It was a benefit.

31:14.109 --> 31:17.796
Claire looked great.
Little black dress.

31:17.916 --> 31:20.252
You've fallen for
her, haven't you?

31:22.478 --> 31:23.740
I would never be inappropriate.

31:23.867 --> 31:25.459
I know that, Charlie.

31:26.192 --> 31:29.007
It's easy to fall for
a woman like Claire.

31:31.459 --> 31:33.181
You can trust me, sir.

31:33.305 --> 31:35.066
I know I can.

31:35.655 --> 31:37.472
It's why you're here.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.773
I shouldn't have done that.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.432
I should never
touch you like that.

31:52.943 --> 31:54.809
It's impure.

32:05.830 --> 32:07.861
What's taking her so long?

32:08.635 --> 32:10.381
Go upstairs and get her.

32:25.037 --> 32:26.320
She's not upstairs.

32:26.963 --> 32:28.443
- What?
- I looked all over the place.

32:28.555 --> 32:29.861
She and Joey are both gone.

32:29.976 --> 32:31.069
They must have gone
down the back stairs

32:31.186 --> 32:32.335
out through the back door.

32:32.482 --> 32:33.669
What are we gonna do?

32:33.771 --> 32:35.495
I don't know.
Just let me think.

32:42.824 --> 32:44.674
Run to the street.
Don't stop.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.044
Help will be there.

32:47.764 --> 32:49.127
Hold your fire.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.172
It's the girl.
She's getting away.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.982
We're in trouble.

33:03.457 --> 33:04.976
- Mike.
- Hey, Ryan.

33:05.106 --> 33:05.863
Emma's running,

33:05.975 --> 33:07.634
southwest corner of the
property, towards the woods.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.620
She's got Joey.

33:08.728 --> 33:10.173
Got it.
That was Hardy.

33:10.351 --> 33:11.902
Emma and Joey are on their way.

33:11.996 --> 33:13.222
Eyes up.

33:17.428 --> 33:18.909
FBI. Show your hands.
Do it now!

33:19.042 --> 33:20.089
- Okay, okay...
- Show your hands.

33:20.218 --> 33:22.583
- Get on the ground. Do it now.
- Okay, relax, everything's fine.

33:22.753 --> 33:24.576
All the way.
Move it!

33:35.390 --> 33:36.987
Come on, Joey. Stay with me.
We're almost there.

33:37.096 --> 33:37.963
Where are we going?

33:38.072 --> 33:38.898
Someplace safe,

33:39.002 --> 33:40.522
away from the people
who will hurt you.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.299
What about Jacob and Paul?

33:43.527 --> 33:44.668
They'll be fine.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.050
Don't move!

33:48.898 --> 33:50.896
Hands in the air now.

33:51.872 --> 33:54.183
Joey, it's okay.

33:54.393 --> 33:55.737
We're here to help you.

34:03.279 --> 34:05.157
I'm with Roderick.
Let's go.

34:05.272 --> 34:06.605
Come on!

34:11.931 --> 34:13.291
- Let me help you.
- I'm okay.

34:13.425 --> 34:14.425
Then you need to help me,

34:14.454 --> 34:15.952
because you know where Joey is.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.795
I'm gonna take you to him.

34:18.878 --> 34:20.601
Okay? I promise.

34:22.065 --> 34:24.344
- What is that?
- Somebody's here.

34:25.556 --> 34:26.946
- Damn it.
- Federal agents!

34:27.101 --> 34:28.627
Get down on the ground now!

34:28.751 --> 34:29.757
Aah!

34:43.701 --> 34:45.286
They're gone, sir.

34:48.686 --> 34:50.900
Agent Parker, Hardy's
out of the house.

34:51.027 --> 34:52.438
So is Joey and the nanny.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.702
The two men are still inside.

34:55.123 --> 34:56.889
- Take it down.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.682
- Uhh.
- It's okay.

35:06.511 --> 35:08.367
I can't believe Emma left.

35:08.514 --> 35:09.470
Why would she leave?

35:09.578 --> 35:12.259
I don't know. I don't know.
But we gotta get out of here.

35:21.468 --> 35:23.682
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.
We surrender.

35:31.608 --> 35:32.571
Roderick sent us.

35:32.682 --> 35:35.144
Go out the back.
Go. Now.

35:39.791 --> 35:40.978
Mike.

35:41.631 --> 35:45.076
Mike. Mike.
Mike. Mike.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.611
Ava.
The local cop.

35:49.727 --> 35:51.698
She's in on it.
She shot me point blank.

35:53.502 --> 35:55.170
- Where'd she go?
- That way.

35:55.356 --> 35:57.147
I'm fine.
I'm wearing a vest.

36:13.992 --> 36:15.290
Full tank.
Everything you need

36:15.434 --> 36:16.644
is in the glove compartment.

36:16.740 --> 36:17.900
The keys are in the ignition.

36:17.940 --> 36:18.790
Where are we going?

36:18.893 --> 36:20.748
I told you.
Far away.

36:20.849 --> 36:22.009
Where they won't shoot at us.

36:22.025 --> 36:23.789
- Better get moving.
- Stop right there!

36:26.292 --> 36:29.053
No. Joey, no.
Wait.

36:35.096 --> 36:36.372
Oh.

36:51.563 --> 36:53.031
Man, you scared me.
You okay?

36:53.155 --> 36:54.273
I've been better.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.282
Oh! Uhh!

37:10.936 --> 37:12.738
We blocked off every road
in a 10-mile radius.

37:12.852 --> 37:14.030
Nobody's seen him yet.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.899
How the hell did
they get out of here?

37:16.002 --> 37:17.339
Thought you had this
place on lockdown.

37:17.451 --> 37:19.737
Carroll's people killed
two of our SWAT guys

37:19.848 --> 37:21.421
guarding the southwest exit,

37:21.529 --> 37:24.713
took their weapons,
posed as SWAT, killed two more.

37:24.822 --> 37:26.519
They planted a police
officer in town.

37:26.602 --> 37:28.179
How did they do that?

37:29.326 --> 37:30.536
They have tactical resources.

37:30.648 --> 37:32.230
I mean, who are these people?

37:36.954 --> 37:38.448
Ryan, are you okay?

37:39.100 --> 37:40.481
Just let him go.

38:13.599 --> 38:15.774
How did Joe Carroll bring
all these people together?

38:15.900 --> 38:16.958
Where did they come from?

38:17.077 --> 38:19.062
Cult mentality is one of unity.

38:19.793 --> 38:21.260
It's human nature.

38:22.458 --> 38:24.918
We all want to belong.

38:25.515 --> 38:27.437
It's a primal need.

38:30.459 --> 38:32.300
You're my parents.

38:32.807 --> 38:35.389
I wanted to see you.
We're family.

38:35.512 --> 38:37.313
No.

38:38.371 --> 38:40.094
No, she came out of guilt.

38:40.192 --> 38:42.040
She wants our forgiveness.

38:42.159 --> 38:43.665
Is that what you think?

38:43.772 --> 38:46.148
You destroyed us.

38:46.350 --> 38:47.978
You ran off in
the middle of the night.

38:48.129 --> 38:51.623
We lost our standing.
We were almost exiled.

38:54.191 --> 38:55.795
No, mom.

38:56.271 --> 38:58.540
I don't want your forgiveness.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.959
I came to forgive you...

39:06.510 --> 39:08.454
and tell you that I love you.

39:09.527 --> 39:11.180
Both of you.

39:12.803 --> 39:15.220
And I always will.

39:27.868 --> 39:29.777
Please remember that.

39:39.926 --> 39:41.462
What have you done?

39:42.420 --> 39:43.409
Debra, you have to.

39:43.538 --> 39:44.422
No. No, mother.

39:44.531 --> 39:46.713
- You have to.
- I'm not going!

39:49.959 --> 39:51.744
You have to.

39:53.338 --> 39:54.997
Shh, shh, shh.

40:16.343 --> 40:19.407
The FBI compromised a
farmhouse in Dutchess County,

40:19.537 --> 40:21.536
but your people
got out safely...

40:22.257 --> 40:23.742
including your son.

40:23.873 --> 40:26.337
The FBI has no idea
where he is.

40:28.470 --> 40:31.104
And now it's time.

40:31.281 --> 40:32.942
For what?

40:33.890 --> 40:36.614
The next part of the story.

40:38.864 --> 40:41.187
This morning I filed a motion

40:41.309 --> 40:43.163
on behalf of my client
Joe Carroll

40:43.746 --> 40:45.792
with the Federal Bureau
of Prisons

40:45.895 --> 40:48.264
for violations of
the eighth amendment.

40:48.615 --> 40:49.899
Mr. Carroll has been subject to

40:50.006 --> 40:52.851
numerous incidents of abuse
by the FBI.

40:53.069 --> 40:55.600
This abuse has to
stop immediately.

40:55.933 --> 40:57.784
Also, we have requested that...

40:57.891 --> 40:59.834
Ryan Hardy's here.

42:14.607 --> 42:16.910
Emma. Hello?

42:17.028 --> 42:18.945
Emma. Emma, come on,
say something.

42:19.045 --> 42:20.408
I know that you're there.

42:20.991 --> 42:24.070
Emma. Emma,
where are you?

42:24.168 --> 42:25.955
You left us?

42:26.290 --> 42:27.978
Why did you leave us?

42:29.205 --> 42:30.588
Emma!

42:36.242 --> 42:38.948
Hang on. Hang on. Look at me.

42:39.581 --> 42:41.232
I'm gonna get us some help.

42:41.569 --> 42:42.849
Just hang on.

42:43.634 --> 42:47.381
Thank you for not leaving me.

42:47.497 --> 42:48.955
Breathe.
