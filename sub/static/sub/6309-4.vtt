Mnh-mnh. You can never be too
careful at Wexler University.

01:11.820 --> 01:13.887
Founded by Josiah Wexler.

01:14.690 --> 01:16.941
The renowned occultist?

01:16.942 --> 01:19.243
Has anybody found the occult
section of the library?

01:19.244 --> 01:20.862
- Yeah. I got them.
- Ah.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.446
They were mixed in
with the French cookbooks.

01:22.447 --> 01:24.665
And by the way, it's
infested with spiders!

01:24.666 --> 01:27.368
Ah. Well, spiders are our
garden friends, Mr. Stone.

Josiah Wexler, founded Wexler University

01:34.760 --> 01:37.011
in 1813 in eastern Massachusetts.

01:37.012 --> 01:39.347
While professing to be a
small liberal arts college,

01:39.348 --> 01:41.883
he used the university to secretly
collect arcane artifacts,

01:41.884 --> 01:45.720

strange and perverse rituals."

01:45.721 --> 01:47.722
- Strange and perverse rituals?
- Mm.

01:47.723 --> 01:51.058
Is that a guy with a goat head
or a goat with a... guy's body?

01:51.059 --> 01:52.810
Not sure I want to know.

01:52.811 --> 01:55.363
Blah, blah, blah. Super-creepy stuff.

01:55.364 --> 01:57.865
Yes, and after Wexler's
explosion and death...

01:57.866 --> 02:00.934
Wait... the college exploded
or Wexler exploded?

[Shuddering] Ugh.

02:11.330 --> 02:14.048
Well, anyway, the college's
arcane past was covered up,

02:14.049 --> 02:15.833
but it is still a Bermuda Triangle

02:15.834 --> 02:17.001
of magical disturbances.

02:17.002 --> 02:18.753
Anything... anything can happen,

02:18.754 --> 02:21.088

actual Bermuda Triangle.

Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

02:28.063 --> 02:29.847
I've been studying the theoretical math

02:29.848 --> 02:31.399
behind extradimensional spaces,

02:31.400 --> 02:34.017
so a black void would actually
be super-interesting!

02:35.487 --> 02:37.155

about going to school...

Hey, I wish I could have gone
to college, but I couldn't.

02:43.829 --> 02:45.363
Jenkins, we've done this before.

Weird school aside, this is a
missing-person investigation.

costume possibly have gotten?

That's the only excuse I'll take.

02:59.127 --> 03:01.429

03:07.519 --> 03:11.856
So, Peter, your mascot, just left school?

03:11.857 --> 03:14.392
Yeah. Sure. Happens all the time.

03:14.393 --> 03:15.977
Just like every other college,

03:15.978 --> 03:17.862
one in five Wexler
students just disappear

03:17.863 --> 03:19.981
and transfer out in the
middle of the night.

03:19.982 --> 03:20.982
The usual.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.149
Oh.

03:22.150 --> 03:24.785
Actually, super unusual.

03:24.786 --> 03:27.788
[Sighs] I still don't get
why Peter left, though.

03:27.789 --> 03:29.240
Oh!

03:29.241 --> 03:30.825
Maybe he found where the
volleyball team ended up

03:30.826 --> 03:32.243
after that away game.

03:32.244 --> 03:34.962
All we found was a bus
full of empty clothes.

03:36.832 --> 03:39.166

03:40.469 --> 03:42.419
like, a weird wart outbreak this year.

You know, those warts that
give you screaming nightmares?

04:21.877 --> 04:24.545
Jenkins was right...
Wexler equals weird.

04:24.546 --> 04:27.214
I wonder if thinking your
small liberal arts school

04:27.215 --> 04:29.183
can beat Michigan is magical delusion

04:29.184 --> 04:30.968
or just regular delusion.

what they're cheering?

No. You do not.

really smelly, you know?

Yeah. Have any idea where your
roommate was heading that night?

04:55.127 --> 04:56.377
With the big game this weekend,

04:56.378 --> 04:58.045
Peter was making the party rounds.

the mascot at their party,

04:59.965 --> 05:01.332
pump up the crowd.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.802
The night he disappeared,
he was supposed to go to...

05:04.803 --> 05:06.053
Omega Theta.

05:06.054 --> 05:09.090
Man, does that house
have a weird history.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.424
- Right.
- By "weird history,"

05:10.425 --> 05:13.894
you mean they throw parties without beer?

05:13.895 --> 05:18.099
No. Like, you need an invite to
get into the house on paper.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.851
And there's all these rumors
about rituals in the basement...

05:20.852 --> 05:22.269
animal sacrifices and stuff.

05:22.270 --> 05:24.355
Peter heard all this
from Professor Bancroft

05:24.356 --> 05:25.573
in his architecture class.

05:25.574 --> 05:27.525
Professor Bancroft?

05:27.526 --> 05:30.277
Professor Roger Bancroft teaches here?

05:30.278 --> 05:31.612
Are you kidding me?

05:31.613 --> 05:33.447
Professor Bancroft is... is the authority

05:33.448 --> 05:35.416
on Colonial American architecture, man.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.084
You are so lucky!

05:37.085 --> 05:38.919
I-I-I would... I would have killed

05:38.920 --> 05:41.172
to have taken classes
from... from... from...

05:41.173 --> 05:42.623
And you... you don't even care.

05:42.624 --> 05:44.592
Nobody does, mate.

05:44.593 --> 05:48.244
But I would love to know where
this Omega Theta house is.

05:51.299 --> 05:53.300
My experiences with frat
houses are limited,

05:53.301 --> 05:54.685
but I don't think evil rituals

05:54.686 --> 05:56.470
are supposed to sound like a kegger.

05:56.471 --> 05:58.139
- [Students cheering]
- I wouldn't be so sure.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.141
Look at the emblems
on those corner braces.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.393
Intersecting circles
of magic and summoning.

06:02.394 --> 06:04.111
That's 18th century occult spiritualism.

06:04.112 --> 06:05.363
That's definitely magicy.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.148
We got to find the origin of this house.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.116
All right, I bet you
anything Professor Bancroft

06:09.117 --> 06:11.068
would have something to
say about these symbols.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.113
Okay, so, divide and conquer?

06:13.114 --> 06:14.486
Ezekiel, Cassandra, check out the house.

06:14.487 --> 06:16.157
Stone and I will go
talk to the professor.

06:16.158 --> 06:19.493
Admit it... You just don't
want to go to a frat party.

06:19.494 --> 06:21.245
I really don't.

06:21.246 --> 06:22.528
Come on, Stone.

06:23.882 --> 06:25.216
Okay, so, the roommate said

06:25.217 --> 06:26.917
that we needed an invitation to get in,

06:26.918 --> 06:28.335
so what do you want to do?

06:28.336 --> 06:30.221
Do you want to sneak
in the back door or...

06:30.222 --> 06:33.224
Ooh, ooh, ooh! We could pretend
that we're delivering pizzas!

06:33.225 --> 06:36.477
Or the invitation I stole
off the mascot's desk.

06:36.478 --> 06:37.678

07:15.418 --> 07:17.035
I put the call out online,

would actually show.

about hunting magic.

Maybe.

07:37.140 --> 07:39.224
Everyone knows Wexler's an odd place.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.475
I started looking into it.

07:40.476 --> 07:42.227
After the mascot disappeared,

07:42.228 --> 07:44.813
I told my magic group online
I was going to investigate.

07:44.814 --> 07:47.315
No, they're super-cool on the Lake Forum.

07:47.316 --> 07:49.368
Just women who really want
to understand magic...

07:49.369 --> 07:50.851

my forum, who are you?

08:02.331 --> 08:04.049
So, sorry you wasted your time.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.668
But, you know, at least you have
a good story for your forum.

08:06.669 --> 08:08.470
Just out of curiosity, though,

08:08.471 --> 08:11.423
why were you hunting magic at
this particular frat house?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.592
Because of this.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.677
These are readings from my
equipment at the science lab,

08:15.678 --> 08:17.846
where I'm building my
particle accelerator.

08:17.847 --> 08:21.400
The last couple of days, it's been
registering strange power surges.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.734
I traced the last one here

08:22.735 --> 08:24.519
around the time the mascot disappeared.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.188
Right, well, a power surge alone

08:26.189 --> 08:27.856
isn't necessarily an
indicator of magic, so...

08:27.857 --> 08:29.691
But with readings like these,

08:29.692 --> 08:32.193
this building should have been leveled.

Okay, that is... harder to... argue with.

Um, why don't you leave
this to the professionals,

09:10.450 --> 09:11.867
Oh! Hey, Lucy.

09:11.868 --> 09:14.236
Uh, really? They're with you?

09:14.237 --> 09:16.238
Sure! He's...

09:16.239 --> 09:18.540
an exchange student,
and she's a grad student.

09:18.541 --> 09:21.325
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.164
All right, there he is.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.666
Okay, now, listen.

09:27.667 --> 09:31.253
Professor Bancroft's analysis
is radically aggressive.

09:31.254 --> 09:33.221
Okay, he's... he's a brutal academic.

09:33.222 --> 09:34.806
Ooh! Then I'll be on my guard.

09:34.807 --> 09:35.807
Yes.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.643
Uh, excuse me, sir.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.312
Professor Bancroft?

09:40.313 --> 09:41.930
- Yes.
- Uh, yeah...

09:41.931 --> 09:44.349
Uh, we... uh... [Chuckles]

09:44.350 --> 09:47.634
Can I just start by saying
what a huge fan I am?

09:48.571 --> 09:49.604
Hmm?

09:49.605 --> 09:51.356
[Chuckles] Seriously.

09:51.357 --> 09:54.943
Your analysis on how the
American residential dwellings

09:54.944 --> 09:56.611
changed during the 18th century...

09:56.612 --> 09:58.413
just... I mean, mind-blowing.

09:58.414 --> 09:59.915
[Chuckles]

09:59.916 --> 10:02.450
That was so long ago, I'm
surprised you found it.

10:02.451 --> 10:05.921
Well, I, uh, actually wrote
a small critique off of it.

10:05.922 --> 10:08.405
Uh, Oliver Thompson.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.458
That's you?

10:10.459 --> 10:11.593
That's me.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.795
[Laughs] I believe I read it.

10:13.796 --> 10:15.680
Yeah, that was a delightful little spin

10:15.681 --> 10:17.299
on my groundbreaking work.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.384
Thank you. I-I-I-I was...
I was just, you know...

10:19.385 --> 10:21.603
I went off of what you were
doing, so it was very...

10:21.604 --> 10:22.938
We hear you've been lecturing

10:22.939 --> 10:24.723
on the architecture here on the campus.

10:24.724 --> 10:25.974
I have.

10:25.975 --> 10:27.442
I managed to acquire

10:27.443 --> 10:29.277
the original plans for the buildings.

10:29.278 --> 10:32.480
They show some fascinating
design and materials.

10:32.481 --> 10:34.449
Specifically, we... we were gonna...

10:34.450 --> 10:36.535
we were wondering about
the Omega Theta house

10:36.536 --> 10:38.018
and the occult history.

10:38.988 --> 10:40.038
[Sighing] Ohh.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.855
You're one of those.

10:42.658 --> 10:43.792
One of who?

10:43.793 --> 10:46.328
One of those people

10:46.329 --> 10:48.830
who believe all the
nonsense about Wexler.

10:48.831 --> 10:52.000
Listen, I hate to burst
your bubble of delusion,

10:52.001 --> 10:54.886
but magic does not exist.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.888
It doesn't exist in architecture,

10:56.889 --> 10:59.641
it certainly does not exist here.

10:59.642 --> 11:02.960
There is no such thing as magic.

11:04.347 --> 11:06.814
[Indistinct conversations music playing]

11:07.650 --> 11:08.683
Ah!

11:08.684 --> 11:09.985
Spoke to one of the brothers.

11:09.986 --> 11:12.687
Said they hired a mascot,
but he never showed.

11:12.688 --> 11:15.323
And then he asked me about
getting his deposit back.

11:15.324 --> 11:16.908
- That's cold.
- Yeah.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.778
I thought so, too, so I stole his watch.

11:19.779 --> 11:20.996
If I had known this much wealth

11:20.997 --> 11:22.466
was gonna be on display at college,

11:22.467 --> 11:24.332
I would have bought into
higher education a lot sooner.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.867
Okay, well, while you
were doing all of this,

11:25.868 --> 11:27.369
did you happen to find any evidence

11:27.370 --> 11:28.703
of a power surge or a missing mascot?

11:28.704 --> 11:31.456
Well, I haven't checked upstairs.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.091
Gonna guess that these rich frat brothers

11:33.092 --> 11:35.093
keep their electronics out in the open.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.878
Go! Go! Go!

11:39.382 --> 11:41.383
Do you know what we're looking for?

11:41.384 --> 11:43.551
There isn't a we. There is just me.

11:43.552 --> 11:45.887
And my... friend.

11:45.888 --> 11:47.806
And I am in no way saying
that magic exists.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.724
It's so great that you
have a team to work with.

11:49.725 --> 11:50.976
I would love that.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.477
Or do you call yourselves a squad?

11:52.478 --> 11:54.062
No. No, we don't.

11:54.063 --> 11:56.865
Just, shouldn't you be doing
your studies or something

11:56.866 --> 11:59.451
instead of wasting your
time with hunting magic?

11:59.452 --> 12:00.562
Oh, my studies are fine.

12:00.563 --> 12:01.987
I read every textbook
from cover to cover

12:01.988 --> 12:03.872
before the semester started.

12:03.873 --> 12:06.741
Well, there's plenty more
to college than that.

12:06.742 --> 12:10.829
There's pep rallies and parties and...

12:10.830 --> 12:12.747
college things!

12:12.748 --> 12:14.332
Don't underestimate it.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.551
Not everyone gets that experience.

12:16.552 --> 12:19.004
It's fun, but I've always noticed things.

12:19.005 --> 12:22.424
Like the power surges on my
particle accelerator equipment

12:22.425 --> 12:24.092
or how Witten's M-theory implies more

12:24.093 --> 12:26.728
than the standard 11-dimensional
supergravity solutions.

12:26.729 --> 12:29.431
Wait. You... You read Witten's M-Theory?

12:29.432 --> 12:31.733
I mean, there are like
10 people in the world

12:31.734 --> 12:32.934
that understand that.

12:32.935 --> 12:34.769
11 now.

12:34.770 --> 12:38.023
But once I notice something,
I can't ignore it anymore.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.108
I have to find out
everything I can about it.

12:40.109 --> 12:42.827
Like... like with magic?

12:42.828 --> 12:45.613
So you're saying magic exists?

12:45.614 --> 12:46.915
- Well... Ooh!
- Oh. I'm sorry.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.533
- Hey!
- My bad.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.168
Ew. Well, that's sticky.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.871
Yeah, one of these rooms, for sure.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.071
Look.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.174
Yo, man. Come on.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.793
That must be the basement.

12:58.794 --> 13:00.795
[Footsteps crunching] Oh. Oh!

13:00.796 --> 13:02.797
Yes, everything is sticky now.

13:02.798 --> 13:05.517
Weren't there rumors of
rituals in the basement?

13:05.518 --> 13:07.134
You're right.

13:08.971 --> 13:10.522
Come on. Let's go.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.023
- Us?
- Yeah.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.609
Wait. Shouldn't we call for backup?

13:14.610 --> 13:16.978
No. I got this.

13:16.979 --> 13:19.030
I'm a Librarian.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.149
A what?

13:21.150 --> 13:22.901
That's just not true!

13:22.902 --> 13:25.036
I-I-I... Unbelievable.

13:25.037 --> 13:28.873
You're... You're denying the
existence of Stonehenge?

13:28.874 --> 13:32.043
No, I am denying the havey-cavey woo-woo

13:32.044 --> 13:34.129
people ascribe to what is
essentially a giant calendar,

13:34.130 --> 13:36.581
- you conspiracy theorist dilettante!
- The... I'm...

13:36.582 --> 13:38.166
Dilettante? Dilettante?!

13:38.167 --> 13:39.801
BAIRD: Dilettante?

13:39.802 --> 13:42.035
Isn't this where you
smack him with a glove?

13:44.507 --> 13:47.841
[Chanting in Latin]

13:50.596 --> 13:52.063
Did you know the fraternity brothers

13:52.064 --> 13:53.681
have real diamonds on their rings?

13:53.682 --> 13:55.850
- It's like...
- Shh!

13:55.851 --> 13:59.269
We invoke the old ones.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.141
We invoke our makers.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.195
That's so weird.

14:07.196 --> 14:11.116
It's like the walls are
made of some sort of onyx.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.536
The entire basement's lined with it.

14:14.537 --> 14:17.005
We invoke our gods...

14:17.006 --> 14:18.006
the gods...

14:18.007 --> 14:20.008
of beer pong!

14:20.009 --> 14:21.543
[Students cheering] All right!

14:21.544 --> 14:22.710
Here we go.

14:22.711 --> 14:24.962
- [Ping-pong ball bounces]
- Let's go!

14:25.714 --> 14:26.913
[All scream]

14:28.968 --> 14:30.718
Let me explain something to you, okay?

14:30.719 --> 14:32.804
Just because you have a dozen degrees

14:32.805 --> 14:34.773
doesn't mean you know anything!

14:34.774 --> 14:36.891
Those dozen degrees mean
that I have studied things

14:36.892 --> 14:38.226
that you never dreamed back on the farm.

14:38.227 --> 14:39.727
- [Power surges]
- Guys?

14:39.728 --> 14:42.230
I am Roger Bancroft,
distinguished professor...

14:42.231 --> 14:44.866
B.A., M.A., C.Phil, Ph.D.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.985
If you lived a hundred
lives, your pea brain

14:46.986 --> 14:48.903
- Guys?!
- would never be able to absorb what I know.

14:48.904 --> 14:52.540
And I know that your question about magic

14:52.541 --> 14:55.076
is the stupidest thing I've ever heard!

14:55.077 --> 14:56.578
[Creature roars]

14:56.579 --> 14:58.111
[Screams]

15:00.916 --> 15:02.133
What was that?

15:02.134 --> 15:04.135
A tentacle monster.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.286
A...big one.

15:08.719 --> 15:11.555
So, we have a tentacle monster,

15:11.556 --> 15:13.307
no mascot,

15:13.308 --> 15:16.310
college student probing
the mysteries of magic.

15:16.311 --> 15:17.812
[Sighs] And what did I tell you

15:17.813 --> 15:19.763
about looking the gargoyles in the eye?

15:19.764 --> 15:22.349
It's like feeding a stray dog.
You'll never get rid of it now.

15:22.350 --> 15:24.485
Don't talk that way in
front of Stumpy, Jenkins!

15:24.486 --> 15:26.604
Can we please focus on
the tentacle monster

15:26.605 --> 15:28.572
that ate the mascot and the professor?

15:28.573 --> 15:30.024
We don't know that they were eaten.

15:30.025 --> 15:31.742
Technically, they were just taken

15:31.743 --> 15:33.661
through a rift in space
that appeared suddenly...

15:33.662 --> 15:34.862
as they do.

15:34.863 --> 15:36.997
That, paired with the power surge

15:36.998 --> 15:38.833
you say Miss Lyon tracked,

15:38.834 --> 15:41.085
implies a classic summoned creature

15:41.086 --> 15:44.121
from an alternate dimension...
possibly Lovecraftian.

15:44.122 --> 15:46.624
Lovecraft. H.P. Lovecraft?

15:46.625 --> 15:50.094
Lovely lyrical name, isn't it?
For such a troubled mind.

15:50.095 --> 15:53.597
He based his fictional
Miskatonic University on Wexler.

15:53.598 --> 15:55.015
Well, that would have been nice to know

15:55.016 --> 15:56.851
before a tentacle monster
appeared in front of us.

15:56.852 --> 15:59.136
So, we find out what
dimension they're in,

15:59.137 --> 16:00.721
and we bring them back.

16:00.722 --> 16:01.772
Easy-peasy.

16:01.773 --> 16:03.607
No, sorry. Not easy-peasy.

16:03.608 --> 16:05.392
Once through to an alternate dimension,

16:05.393 --> 16:07.978
the chances of return... microscopic.

16:07.979 --> 16:09.647
Plus, probably, they've been eaten.

16:09.648 --> 16:10.898
- What?!
- Sorry.

16:10.899 --> 16:12.449
Then we shut down the dimensional rift

16:12.450 --> 16:13.701
before anyone else gets grabbed.

16:13.702 --> 16:14.985
Okay, but if the creature was summoned,

16:14.986 --> 16:16.654
that means someone was summoning it.

16:16.655 --> 16:19.957
Yes. And summoned creatures
do not attack at random.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.792
They have specific targets.

16:21.793 --> 16:24.461
So we find out why the professor
and the mascot were targeted.

16:24.462 --> 16:25.713
What did they have in common?

16:25.714 --> 16:27.164
Peter was in Bancroft's class.

16:27.165 --> 16:28.883
They were studying the
history of the college.

16:28.884 --> 16:30.167
Could be a link there.

16:30.168 --> 16:32.836
Plus, other students could be in danger.

16:32.837 --> 16:35.806
And the frat house... it had
a weird foundation, right?

16:35.807 --> 16:37.373
It was like a black stone.

16:38.143 --> 16:40.177
That is definitely in Bancroft's research.

16:40.178 --> 16:41.679
I'm hitting the college.

16:41.680 --> 16:45.065
And I'll go rifle through his office.

16:45.066 --> 16:47.851
Stumpy. Stay.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.302
Good boy!

16:52.190 --> 16:55.159
He can't be serious, thinking
this is Dutch Colonial.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.193
Freakin' windbag.

16:56.194 --> 16:57.611
Hi.

16:57.612 --> 16:59.113
Hi. Hi.

16:59.114 --> 17:01.081
Where's Professor Bancroft?

17:01.082 --> 17:02.116
Uh...

17:02.117 --> 17:05.002
Professor Bancroft is not here.

17:05.002 --> 17:06.837
And, uh, he won't be...

17:06.838 --> 17:08.172
for a while.

17:08.173 --> 17:10.174
[Scoffs] That's not surprising.

17:10.175 --> 17:12.710
Like every other college, one
in five of our professors

17:12.711 --> 17:15.128
just moves or transfers out
in the middle of the night...

17:15.130 --> 17:16.964
never to be seen again.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.598
So, are you the guest lecturer?

17:18.599 --> 17:20.800
Oh. Uh...

17:21.886 --> 17:23.771
I am.

17:23.771 --> 17:25.472
I'm just... that's what I was doing here,

17:25.473 --> 17:27.057
was trying to figure
out where he left off.

17:27.058 --> 17:29.893
Now, you wouldn't happen to
know what he was teaching?

17:29.894 --> 17:31.612
Yeah... architectural history of Wexler.

17:31.613 --> 17:33.030
Ohh!

17:33.031 --> 17:34.865
Yeah, he found the school's
original plans, too.

17:34.866 --> 17:36.182
They're right here.

17:37.736 --> 17:39.620
Building materials.

17:39.621 --> 17:41.572
Omega Theta house is on a foundation

17:41.573 --> 17:44.825
of rare black stone
from the Pacific Ocean.

17:44.826 --> 17:46.744
Bancroft said that was a coincidence.

17:46.745 --> 17:49.630
Yeah, well, more proof
Bancroft doesn't know jack.

17:49.631 --> 17:50.881
What?

17:50.882 --> 17:53.717
The building materials in the foundation...

17:53.718 --> 17:56.953
I mean, you'd have to change the
whole architectural design.

17:59.257 --> 18:01.592
Class project.

18:01.593 --> 18:03.727
Yeah? Foundation strength.

18:03.728 --> 18:05.479
- Okay, excuse me... What was your name?
- Mindy.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.181
Mindy, can you help me
pass these out real quick?

18:07.182 --> 18:09.016
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

18:09.017 --> 18:10.851
All right, so, take one
and pass them down,

18:10.852 --> 18:12.019
give them to your friends.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.654
For you guys, okay.

18:13.655 --> 18:15.739
I'm assuming you guys
know how to compute it.

18:15.740 --> 18:20.995
Okay, now, what we're looking
for is nonstandard values.

18:20.996 --> 18:23.947
All right, primarily low Poisson ratio

18:23.948 --> 18:26.617
and... and uniaxial
compression strength.

18:26.618 --> 18:28.168
You got to look at the
base for stuff like that.

18:28.169 --> 18:29.286
You got to get deep into it.

18:29.287 --> 18:30.788
Oh! I have one.

18:30.789 --> 18:32.706
Okay, let's start with you.
What do you got?

18:32.707 --> 18:34.208
- This building.
- This building here? Yeah.

18:34.209 --> 18:36.176
- The Architecture Building.
- Architecture Building.

18:36.177 --> 18:37.211
That is right.

18:37.212 --> 18:39.295
And we know Omega Theta.

18:40.332 --> 18:41.548
Classics Building.

18:41.549 --> 18:43.017
Classics Building. Show me.

18:43.018 --> 18:44.885
- Right there.
- Nice, Bubba. That one will work.

18:44.886 --> 18:47.169
Classics Building. All right.

18:49.641 --> 18:51.173
That's now the Science Building.

18:55.864 --> 18:57.930
And the gym.

19:02.037 --> 19:03.037
A circle?

19:03.038 --> 19:05.021
Nope.

19:06.074 --> 19:07.991
A summoning circle.

19:07.992 --> 19:09.660
Magic symbology

19:09.661 --> 19:12.913
carved right into the design
of the college itself.

19:12.914 --> 19:14.665
The power surges...

19:14.666 --> 19:16.750
I registered the power surge
when the mascot disappeared,

19:16.751 --> 19:19.086
but I also registered
much smaller surges

19:19.087 --> 19:20.671
at the science lab and the gym.

19:20.672 --> 19:22.005
I'd bet anything there were surges

19:22.006 --> 19:23.891
at the Classics and
Architecture buildings, too.

19:23.892 --> 19:25.926
The circle is like a circuit.

19:25.927 --> 19:28.178
To activate it, magic needs to be
feeding into one of the points.

19:28.179 --> 19:30.013
So we split up and
investigate the buildings.

19:30.014 --> 19:32.015
We've already seen the architecture
hall and the frat house.

19:32.016 --> 19:33.665
Okay, Lucy and I will
take the science lab.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.234
Hold on.

19:34.235 --> 19:35.903
Lucy, you've been a real big help,

19:35.904 --> 19:37.821
but I think it's time
for us to take over.

19:37.822 --> 19:39.356
Wait.

19:39.357 --> 19:41.909
She followed the clues to
the frat house by herself,

19:41.910 --> 19:44.244
and she's got some really cool
equipment that we could use.

19:44.245 --> 19:46.228
So... what's it hurt?

19:47.782 --> 19:48.866
[Sighing] Okay.

19:48.867 --> 19:50.200
I'll take the Classics,

19:50.201 --> 19:52.202
and I'm texting Ezekiel
to check out the gym.

19:52.203 --> 19:54.204
Okay, and Stone will
be along after class.

19:54.205 --> 19:57.841
Capability Brown really changed the game.

19:57.842 --> 19:59.877
Okay? Because...?

19:59.878 --> 20:04.848
Because he was the first
to emphasize naturalism.

20:04.849 --> 20:07.351
Okay? First to emphasize naturalism.

20:07.352 --> 20:10.187
He made the buildings part
of the landscape, all right?

20:10.188 --> 20:12.306
Instead of just something
that was sitting on top of it.

20:12.307 --> 20:14.858
Because after all...

20:14.859 --> 20:18.445
architecture is art...

20:18.446 --> 20:19.897
that we live in.

20:19.898 --> 20:20.898
[Students murmur]

20:20.899 --> 20:22.116
Huh?

20:22.117 --> 20:23.784
All right, write that down, guys.

20:23.785 --> 20:24.818
Write that down.

20:24.819 --> 20:26.018
Okay.

20:27.372 --> 20:28.739
It's got the emblem.

20:28.740 --> 20:30.290
[Device warbling]

20:30.291 --> 20:33.243
Yeah, and there's a constant
surge coming from the building,

20:33.244 --> 20:34.912
but no evidence of magical activity.

20:34.913 --> 20:36.330
Well, to be fair, that could be

20:36.331 --> 20:38.415
the ghost-containment system
we have in the basement.

20:38.416 --> 20:40.134
[Chuckles nervously]

20:40.135 --> 20:42.169
I know you're kidding, but just
tell me that you're kidding.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.087
[Chuckling] I'm kidding.

20:44.088 --> 20:45.806
I kind of wish there was, though.

20:45.807 --> 20:47.474
At least that would explain everything.

20:47.475 --> 20:51.011
Well, maybe the trip's not an entire bust.

20:51.012 --> 20:53.931
Want to see my particle accelerator?

20:53.932 --> 20:55.315
Hells to the yeah!

20:55.316 --> 20:56.850
Do people still say that?

20:56.851 --> 20:59.353
People probably don't still say that.

20:59.354 --> 21:01.438
We each have our own
space to work, to think,

21:01.439 --> 21:02.940
and Fridays, we order sushi.

21:02.941 --> 21:03.941
Oh!

21:03.942 --> 21:05.307
Oh, wow!

21:06.828 --> 21:08.912
If I had this, I would...

21:08.913 --> 21:10.247
I would never leave.

21:10.248 --> 21:12.249
You know how magic works.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.951
Yeah. Okay. [Chuckles]

21:13.952 --> 21:14.952
Come on.

21:14.953 --> 21:16.787
Now, take a look.

21:16.788 --> 21:18.904
Particle accelerator.

21:21.793 --> 21:24.011
Shouldn't it be, like, a mile bigger?

21:24.012 --> 21:26.463
The real one will be bigger,
but not much bigger.

21:26.464 --> 21:28.015
I'm working on a non-scaling

21:28.016 --> 21:30.350
fixed-field alternating gradient design.

21:30.351 --> 21:32.803
But it's a working model. Watch.

21:32.804 --> 21:34.054
[Computer beeps]

21:34.055 --> 21:36.505
[Whirring]

21:44.949 --> 21:46.400
Electromagnets.

21:46.401 --> 21:48.819
They can't move particles
fast enough at this size.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.237
That's the weird thing.

21:50.238 --> 21:52.239
I built it using some new
theoretical equations

21:52.240 --> 21:53.323
I've been working on,

21:53.324 --> 21:54.958
and I'm not sure how,

21:54.959 --> 21:56.493
but... [Sighs]

21:56.494 --> 21:59.997
...the particles accelerate
faster than I even imagined.

21:59.998 --> 22:02.216
That's not possible.

22:02.217 --> 22:04.301
Well, let me get you the full data.

22:04.302 --> 22:05.919
It's amazing.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.087
Okay.

22:14.846 --> 22:17.147
These results would need
100 yards of track,

22:17.148 --> 22:19.233
which means...

22:19.234 --> 22:22.185
the circle's bigger than it looks.

22:22.186 --> 22:25.405
Oh, Lucy, what have you done?

22:25.406 --> 22:26.406
[Sighs]

22:29.439 --> 22:32.476
I didn't mean to. I swear.
I didn't know it was magic.

22:32.477 --> 22:33.694
It's okay.

22:33.695 --> 22:35.863
I would strongly but
respectfully disagree

22:35.864 --> 22:37.314
that it is okay.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.409
That is why we have the Library...

22:38.410 --> 22:40.278
to keep magic out of untried hands.

22:40.279 --> 22:41.946
Okay, let's just stay focused.

22:41.947 --> 22:44.115
Lucy, what precisely did you do?

22:44.116 --> 22:46.451
I...I don't know.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.202
The equations just came to me.

22:48.203 --> 22:50.288
It's a variation on a compression spell.

22:50.289 --> 22:52.290
Essentially, she built
the particle accelerator

22:52.291 --> 22:53.925
in a compressed pocket of space.

22:53.926 --> 22:55.626
And, by using magic at this spot,

22:55.627 --> 22:57.512
activated the summoning circle.

22:57.513 --> 23:00.431
Oh, God! I killed two people!

23:00.432 --> 23:02.050
We don't know that they're dead.

23:02.051 --> 23:04.302
They were just... taken.

23:04.303 --> 23:05.887
Well, I do hope this serves as a lesson

23:05.888 --> 23:07.605
to keep your curiosity
in check, young lady.

23:07.606 --> 23:09.307
Jenkins!

23:09.308 --> 23:11.526
Colonel, if she had not
been tinkering with magic,

23:11.527 --> 23:13.311
she wouldn't have had the imagination

23:13.312 --> 23:15.029
to even stumble upon her new equations

23:15.030 --> 23:16.481
for the particle accelerator.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.483
Okay, well, then I guess
it's our fault, too.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.401
'Cause all the Library
does is lock up magic

23:20.402 --> 23:22.370
and try to tell people
that it doesn't exist,

23:22.371 --> 23:24.155
when we could be a place
where people like Lucy

23:24.156 --> 23:25.957
can come for answers and knowledge

23:25.958 --> 23:27.075
and... and training.

23:27.076 --> 23:29.127
That's not what the Library does.

23:29.128 --> 23:30.578
Yes. Thank you, Colonel.

23:30.579 --> 23:33.214
You're not right, either!
Magic is out there!

23:33.215 --> 23:35.666
More and more regular people
are coming into contact with it.

23:35.667 --> 23:39.554
We can't just keep boxing it up
and pretending it's swamp gas.

23:39.555 --> 23:41.589
We have to come up with a
strategy for dealing with it.

23:41.590 --> 23:43.508
So how do we deal with it?

23:43.509 --> 23:45.977
We'll deal with it.
It's our responsibility.

23:45.978 --> 23:48.012
But it's my fault.

23:48.013 --> 23:49.680
So I need to know how I can fix it.

23:49.681 --> 23:53.017
Do any of you besides Cassandra
know particle physics?

23:53.018 --> 23:55.987
And what exactly do you know
about summoning circles?

23:55.988 --> 23:58.156
Which is why we need to work together.

23:58.157 --> 24:00.691
Right now, we need Lucy.
She created the device.

24:00.692 --> 24:03.995
Okay, look, if we take the
magic out of the accelerator,

24:03.996 --> 24:06.030
will that deactivate the circle?

24:06.031 --> 24:08.249
It will de-power it but not close it.

24:08.250 --> 24:11.285
For that, we need a ritual,
and the ritual requires

24:11.286 --> 24:14.172
we know specifically what
creature was summoned.

24:14.173 --> 24:15.373
Okay, you work on that.

24:15.374 --> 24:16.624
Cassandra and I will keep working

24:16.625 --> 24:18.575
on the particle accelerator with Lucy.

24:19.711 --> 24:23.297
Be careful, Colonel.
Magic in untried hands...

24:23.298 --> 24:25.498
"They're baaaack!"

24:28.053 --> 24:29.604
I got nothin', man.

24:29.605 --> 24:31.556
I got... I... or I got too much.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.691
There's too many circles
in this symbology text.

24:33.692 --> 24:36.644
Lovecraft's original notes are
not very illuminating, either.

24:36.645 --> 24:39.564
There can't be that many
alternate dimensions

24:39.565 --> 24:41.032
to research.

24:41.033 --> 24:42.733
Well, multiply a million by a million,

24:42.734 --> 24:44.235
and you wouldn't even be close.

24:44.236 --> 24:45.570
And what are you doing?

24:45.571 --> 24:48.706
Research... just not old-person style.

24:48.707 --> 24:50.741
I'm running an image
search on the emblem.

24:50.742 --> 24:53.411
That's actually pretty smart.
Right, Stumpy?

24:53.412 --> 24:56.080
[Laughing] "Oh, yes, Ezekiel.
That's very smart.

24:56.081 --> 24:59.050
Smarter than Jenkins or
Stone could ever be."

24:59.051 --> 25:01.085
Yeah. Keep talking, man.

25:01.086 --> 25:03.171
Bancroft was saying
something sort of like that

25:03.172 --> 25:04.671
right when he got eaten!

25:06.091 --> 25:07.308
What did you say?

25:07.309 --> 25:09.310
- Oh, Stumpy said it.
- Not... Not you.

25:09.311 --> 25:10.728
- Mr. Stone.
- What?

25:10.729 --> 25:12.346
You said that Bancroft was saying

25:12.347 --> 25:15.016
that he was better than you before he...

25:15.017 --> 25:16.484
Yeah.

25:16.485 --> 25:20.021
Would you call him arrogant,
boastful, egotistical?

25:20.022 --> 25:21.405
I'd call him a prick.

25:21.406 --> 25:23.741
And the mascot...

25:23.742 --> 25:26.661
Wexler's biggest fan, full of pride?

25:26.662 --> 25:29.080
Delusional with it, supposedly.

25:29.081 --> 25:30.363
Right.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.452
The monster is a Hybristic.

25:34.453 --> 25:36.754
No, no, man, that's not...
I didn't see that.

25:36.755 --> 25:39.123
- I saw one tentacle come out.
- Well, that's a good thing,

25:39.124 --> 25:42.677
because seeing the entire beast
has been known to drive men mad.

25:42.678 --> 25:44.795
The Hybristic was summoned in ancient times

25:44.796 --> 25:47.348
to quell those who thought of
overthrowing their masters.

25:47.349 --> 25:49.550
It is attracted by overt displays

25:49.551 --> 25:51.602
of pride, hubris, ego.

25:51.603 --> 25:55.356
It appears when such ego is on display...

25:55.357 --> 25:57.525
and devours it.

25:57.526 --> 25:59.560
First things first...
we should turn the power off.

25:59.561 --> 26:01.646
Colonel, please throw
those three breakers...

26:01.647 --> 26:03.481
red, blue, red.

26:03.482 --> 26:05.032
We're gonna figure this out.

26:05.033 --> 26:07.151
Oh, I know...
because I'm going to solve it.

26:07.152 --> 26:09.153
I'm Lucy Lyon, and I will solve it.

26:09.154 --> 26:10.204
[Computer beeps]

26:10.205 --> 26:12.240
That should... do it.

26:12.241 --> 26:14.357
But it didn't. It's still on.

26:15.544 --> 26:18.945
It's like it's being powered
by something we can't see.

26:20.048 --> 26:21.664
It's the dimensional rift.

26:22.634 --> 26:24.335
Now that it's been torn
open, it's stronger.

26:24.336 --> 26:25.670
It's a feedback loop.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.172
The... The accelerator
keeps the rift open,

26:28.173 --> 26:30.841
and the rift powers the weird
physics of the accelerator.

26:30.842 --> 26:32.560
We turn it up.

26:32.561 --> 26:33.844
Turn it up?

26:33.845 --> 26:36.347
I vote against that! Let's call Jenkins.

26:36.348 --> 26:38.816
No, we speed it up so fast that
there's no charge differential.

26:38.817 --> 26:41.319
It'll be like turning an alternating
current into a direct current.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.187
[Computer beeping] Okay, but
with no charge differential,

26:43.188 --> 26:45.273
the magnets will stop being fed.

26:45.274 --> 26:47.241
But... But by drawing
more power from the rift,

26:47.242 --> 26:48.659
we run the risk

26:48.660 --> 26:51.162
of punching a permanent
hole between two worlds.

26:51.163 --> 26:53.531
Wow. That is a whole lot of bad
crammed into one small sentence.

26:53.532 --> 26:55.533
No, it'll work, and it'll be epic.

26:55.534 --> 26:56.867
[Electricity crackling] Lucy?

26:56.868 --> 26:58.669
You need to think about this.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.204
Even if we don't punch a hole,

27:00.205 --> 27:01.622
we'll release so much radiation

27:01.623 --> 27:03.541
that we'll have to vent
into the atmosphere.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.209
Why are you trying to stop me?!

27:05.210 --> 27:07.545
Because you are doing magic,

27:07.546 --> 27:09.714
and... and you don't understand
how dangerous it is.

27:09.715 --> 27:13.184
Maybe I do understand it. After
all, I actually did magic.

27:13.185 --> 27:16.137
Maybe we should calm down, go outside,

27:16.138 --> 27:17.722
sit in on a drum circle.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.889
- A drum circle?
- I don't know!

27:18.890 --> 27:20.775
I went to a military academy!

27:20.776 --> 27:24.312
No! I'm going to solve this...
save the whole freakin' school.

27:24.313 --> 27:26.864
[Power surging] I've got the math,
the science. I even have the magic.

27:26.865 --> 27:30.368
I'm going to win a Nobel Prize
one day, so I can do this!

27:30.369 --> 27:31.369
[Creature roars]

27:31.370 --> 27:32.486
[Screams] Lucy?!

27:32.487 --> 27:34.205
No!

27:34.206 --> 27:36.407
No! No! Baird!

27:36.408 --> 27:38.576
BAIRD: Lucy!

27:38.577 --> 27:40.411
[Gasps]

27:40.412 --> 27:42.612
[Screaming]

27:53.054 --> 27:54.754
We have to get her back.

27:54.755 --> 27:56.172
Get who back?

27:56.173 --> 27:58.925
Lucy. She was taken by the monster.

27:58.926 --> 28:01.061
Lucy was taken?

28:01.062 --> 28:02.512
We activate the rift,

28:02.513 --> 28:04.013
and then we go in, and we get her.

28:04.014 --> 28:05.482
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:05.483 --> 28:08.485
Nobody is going into a dimensional rift.

28:08.486 --> 28:09.736
Are you using these?

28:09.737 --> 28:11.154
- No.
- Okay.

28:11.155 --> 28:12.989
One problem with opening
the rift right now.

28:12.990 --> 28:15.408
The pep rally... it's
being held in the gym.

28:15.409 --> 28:16.943
It's one of the spots on the map.

28:16.944 --> 28:18.078
What does that mean?

28:18.079 --> 28:19.579
Well, we identified the monster.

28:19.580 --> 28:21.948
It's attracted to overt displays of ego.

28:21.949 --> 28:23.750
All those college kids

28:23.751 --> 28:25.118
thinking their team can beat Michigan?

28:25.119 --> 28:26.870
It'll be a feast.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.589
It would be the height of folly
to open the rift right now.

28:29.590 --> 28:31.508
We need to close it and
close it for good.

28:31.509 --> 28:32.876
Can you close it?

28:32.877 --> 28:35.428
We found a ritual. It involves sage.

28:35.429 --> 28:36.546
Nope.

28:36.547 --> 28:38.715
It is the responsible thing to do.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.215
I don't care.

28:41.519 --> 28:44.136
This distance is different
than all the rest of them.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.107
Cassandra, if we open the rift,

28:47.108 --> 28:48.892
we endanger the entire school.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.561
Look, I know you want to find Lucy,

28:51.562 --> 28:53.980
but we can't risk the safety
of all those students.

28:53.981 --> 28:56.649
And I said, "No."

28:56.650 --> 28:58.850
I'm sorry, but you don't
get to make this call.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.821
You want to know the
most important thing

29:01.822 --> 29:03.957
I've learned being a Librarian?

29:03.958 --> 29:05.542
Is that there's a difference

29:05.543 --> 29:08.795
between doing what's best
and doing what's right.

29:08.796 --> 29:11.214
Now, I did what was best once,

29:11.215 --> 29:13.583
and... I was wrong.

29:13.584 --> 29:19.088
So this time, I want to
do what I know is right.

29:19.089 --> 29:21.141
Eve, I'm a Librarian.

29:21.142 --> 29:23.291
And we're gonna go after Lucy.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.598
I'm with you.

29:28.599 --> 29:29.933
[Scoffs] Yeah.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.134
Like you're gonna get
in trouble without me.

29:34.104 --> 29:35.989
Well, then...

29:35.990 --> 29:37.941
we need a plan.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.474
Okay.

29:40.661 --> 29:43.196
So, Lucy said she could
detect energy surges

29:43.197 --> 29:44.948
every time the monster appeared...

29:44.949 --> 29:46.950
these five places.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.619
So those are all potential access points.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.588
So we summon the monster,

29:51.589 --> 29:54.090
and in theory, I should be
able to use the accelerator

29:54.091 --> 29:56.092
to punch a hole into its home dimension.

29:56.093 --> 29:57.844
And then we go get her.

29:57.845 --> 30:02.330
Okay, so, how do we summon
a monster that feeds on...

30:03.551 --> 30:04.750
...ego?

30:08.606 --> 30:10.222
What?

30:11.275 --> 30:13.276
If I am going to be bait,

30:13.277 --> 30:16.646
why are we in a golf cart
and not, say, a Ferrari?

30:16.647 --> 30:18.281
Because we got to get close, all right?

30:18.282 --> 30:20.233
Baird, you in place?

30:20.234 --> 30:23.152
Yeah. Wait for my word.

30:23.153 --> 30:25.738
Okay. That's the last one.

30:25.739 --> 30:28.074
By placing these in a circle,
I've created a magnetic field

30:28.075 --> 30:30.627
at the weakest point of
the dimensional barrier.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.629
Stone will use the spectrometer
to get the energy signature

30:32.630 --> 30:33.997
from the monster when it appears,

30:33.998 --> 30:37.166
and I'll use that to dial
into the right dimension.

30:37.167 --> 30:39.219
As long as they can keep
the monster appearing,

30:39.220 --> 30:40.670
the rift should stay open,

30:40.671 --> 30:42.222
and they'll distract the
monster long enough.

30:42.223 --> 30:43.973
And I can come back with Lucy.

30:43.974 --> 30:45.258
No.

30:45.259 --> 30:46.843
I can.

30:46.844 --> 30:49.178
What? No. I should be
the one to go through.

30:49.179 --> 30:51.014
Baird, I need you here

30:51.015 --> 30:53.066
to do what Stone and Ezekiel can't do...

30:53.067 --> 30:54.183
what I can't do.

30:54.184 --> 30:55.735
If I don't come back, I need you

30:55.736 --> 30:57.020
to push the accelerator into the rift.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.354
It'll stop the feedback loop.

30:58.355 --> 31:01.274
If I throw it in, you can't get back.

31:01.275 --> 31:03.192
Eve, you're the Guardian.

31:03.193 --> 31:06.029
And you're the only person
I trust to make the right call.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.864
[Sighs]

31:07.865 --> 31:09.981
You really are a Librarian.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.234
Yep.

31:14.738 --> 31:16.089
We're in position.

31:16.090 --> 31:17.790
All right.

31:17.791 --> 31:19.292
Go.

31:19.293 --> 31:22.095
Do... Do your thing.

31:22.096 --> 31:24.847
Do the... do the stuff.
Talk about yourself, man.

31:24.848 --> 31:26.299
[Australian accent] Ezekiel Jones!

31:26.300 --> 31:27.717
[Normal voice] Talk about...

31:27.718 --> 31:28.935
Talk about yourself!

31:28.936 --> 31:30.970
It's not like I try to be egotistical!

31:30.971 --> 31:33.222
Right! Right!

31:33.223 --> 31:35.391
Just like...

31:35.392 --> 31:37.226
you don't try to be the best thief.

31:37.227 --> 31:38.361
- Exactly.
- Right.

31:38.362 --> 31:40.063
I just am.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.115
Do you know what it takes
to break into Fort Knox?

31:42.116 --> 31:43.900
I don't, and I've done it.

31:43.901 --> 31:46.869
It's all natural talent.
I am just that awesome.

31:46.870 --> 31:47.870
It's starting!

31:47.871 --> 31:49.956
[Creature roars]

31:49.957 --> 31:52.041
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:52.042 --> 31:54.327
BAIRD: Okay, thanks, Stone.

31:54.328 --> 31:56.444
You could thank me, too!

31:57.498 --> 32:00.615
Whatever you do, keep it
away from the gymnasium.

32:02.970 --> 32:05.254
You sure about this?

32:05.255 --> 32:06.322
No. [Sighs]

32:06.323 --> 32:07.924
Just make sure

32:07.925 --> 32:10.426
the monster doesn't get the
kids or Ezekiel or Stone.

32:10.427 --> 32:13.313
And you do what you have to do.

32:13.314 --> 32:14.430
Promise me.

32:14.431 --> 32:16.766
I promise.

32:16.767 --> 32:18.466
Find Lucy.

32:32.215 --> 32:34.449
[Roaring echoes]

32:38.388 --> 32:41.223
[Echoing] Lucy?

32:41.224 --> 32:43.358
Hello?

32:46.129 --> 32:48.329
[Creature roars]

32:52.786 --> 32:54.370
Baird!

32:54.371 --> 32:55.593
She's through.

32:55.594 --> 32:57.545
I'm just that awesome!

32:57.546 --> 32:59.547
Aah! Aah!

32:59.548 --> 33:00.848
All right, good.

33:00.849 --> 33:02.099
Tell her she better be quick,

33:02.100 --> 33:03.634
'cause once that pep rally starts,

33:03.635 --> 33:05.102
not even Jones' ego is gonna be able

33:05.103 --> 33:06.720
to keep that gym full of kids safe.

33:06.721 --> 33:08.639
Uh, I'm a fantastic dresser.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.025
I mean, I dress better
than any of you.

33:11.026 --> 33:12.526
I'm a great dancer.
And this hair?

33:12.527 --> 33:14.728
I don't even do anything with it.
It just...

33:14.729 --> 33:17.063
- [Creature roars]
- Let go! Let go!

33:19.234 --> 33:21.202
What's it doing?
What's going on?

33:21.203 --> 33:23.120
- What's going on? It's going away!
- I don't know, I...

33:23.121 --> 33:25.156
Keep going. You're awesome,
you're awesome, you're awesome.

33:25.157 --> 33:26.931
Even I run out of awesome
things to say about myself.

33:26.932 --> 33:27.541
Thief. Thief.

33:27.542 --> 33:29.660
- My modesty is one of my strong points.
- Oh, my God!

33:29.661 --> 33:30.705
You could be

33:30.729 --> 33:33.229
- the greatest of all time, Ezekiel Jones.
- Yeah. Yeah, ever.

33:33.414 --> 33:35.799
You might even be able
to take me in a fight.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.301
Yeah! I never thought of that.

33:37.302 --> 33:39.637
- But I absolutely could, right?
- Oh, my...

33:39.638 --> 33:41.088
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, I mean,

33:41.089 --> 33:42.923
I've got a pretty strong
right that's pretty mean.

33:42.924 --> 33:44.564
Well, let's figure out how that happen...

33:46.761 --> 33:48.896
I-I know I'm cute. I'm really cute!

33:48.897 --> 33:51.599
Cute... Yeah. Listen,
you're on the right track.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.852
I think even... even... even Baird
might have something for you.

33:54.853 --> 33:56.237
You know, I always thought...

33:56.238 --> 33:59.188
Yaah! It's him!

34:02.160 --> 34:03.810
[Whimpers]

34:10.085 --> 34:11.952
[Echoing] Lucy?

34:11.953 --> 34:13.985
Is that you?

34:24.331 --> 34:26.232
Lucy?!

34:27.569 --> 34:30.004
[Twigs rustle]

34:30.005 --> 34:31.071
[Screams]

34:31.072 --> 34:32.873
- Lucy!
- Shh!

34:32.873 --> 34:36.143
The smaller one brings back food
for its mate... an offering.

34:36.143 --> 34:38.012
We're on her hunting grounds.

34:38.013 --> 34:39.580
[Creature growls]

34:39.581 --> 34:41.215
[Both panting]

34:41.216 --> 34:43.183
No mascot? No professor?

34:43.184 --> 34:45.051
Not anymore.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.291
[Creature growls]

34:50.292 --> 34:52.993
[Both panting]

34:52.994 --> 34:54.261
Okay.

34:54.262 --> 34:55.763
I didn't come through
space and time

34:55.764 --> 34:57.197
to get eaten today.

34:57.198 --> 34:58.399
Let's go. Go!

34:58.400 --> 35:00.333
[Creature roars]

35:02.270 --> 35:04.004
I'm likely a better singer than you.

35:04.005 --> 35:05.005
What?!

35:05.006 --> 35:07.141
Watch out! Whoa!

35:07.142 --> 35:08.875
[Tires screech]

35:10.679 --> 35:12.563
[Barks]

35:12.564 --> 35:13.981
Stumpy! What are you doing?!

35:13.982 --> 35:15.182
[Snarling]

35:15.183 --> 35:16.267
Stumpy!

35:16.268 --> 35:17.818
[Barking] No!

35:17.819 --> 35:20.771
[Creature roars]

35:20.772 --> 35:22.072

[Creature roaring]

35:30.865 --> 35:32.064
[Both panting]

35:34.703 --> 35:36.086
Aah!

35:36.087 --> 35:37.871
[Panting]

35:37.872 --> 35:40.124
[Roars]

35:40.125 --> 35:42.992
Don't worry. I've got you.

35:59.144 --> 36:03.179
In between... space and time.

36:04.282 --> 36:06.033
Who are you?

36:06.034 --> 36:09.320
Just people... women...

36:09.321 --> 36:12.156
chosen, like you.

36:12.157 --> 36:14.992
We've been waiting for you
for a very long time.

36:14.993 --> 36:17.294
When you learned to
walk between worlds,

36:17.295 --> 36:20.214
you proved ready to take
your place in our circle.

36:20.215 --> 36:22.532
Your circle?

36:24.719 --> 36:26.754
Science and magic.

36:26.755 --> 36:29.056
Long ago, we of the Lake realized

36:29.057 --> 36:32.142
those two practices would
eventually become one.

36:32.143 --> 36:34.345
The Lake.

36:34.346 --> 36:37.931
The Lake Forum online.

36:37.932 --> 36:41.318
You're looking for people
who truly understand magic.

36:41.319 --> 36:45.272
And now we invite you to learn with us...

36:45.273 --> 36:46.440
study...

36:46.441 --> 36:49.058
grow.

36:56.785 --> 36:58.085
Thank you.

36:58.086 --> 37:01.070
But I already have a job.

37:02.457 --> 37:05.926
If that is your wish, Cassandra Cillian.

37:05.927 --> 37:08.045
But should the tide shift,

37:08.046 --> 37:10.297
your place with us will be waiting.

37:10.298 --> 37:12.131
[Voice echoes]

37:15.053 --> 37:16.053
[Gasps]

37:16.054 --> 37:17.688
Lucy!

37:17.689 --> 37:18.806
Where's Cassandra?

37:18.807 --> 37:20.923
She was right behind me.

37:21.860 --> 37:23.277
[Gasps]

37:23.278 --> 37:26.012
Throw it into the rift! Do it now!

37:27.148 --> 37:29.348
[Electricity crackling]

37:38.793 --> 37:39.827
It's gone.

37:39.828 --> 37:41.160
They did it.

37:41.996 --> 37:44.196
[Breathing shakily]

37:50.839 --> 37:52.955
Stumpy!

37:57.762 --> 38:00.397
[Indistinct conversations]

38:00.398 --> 38:02.816
Most people, when almost
eaten by a tentacle monster,

38:02.817 --> 38:05.185
would have sworn off magic forever.

38:05.186 --> 38:07.521
But [chuckles] not Lucy Lyon.

38:07.522 --> 38:09.923
[Chuckles] Well, you know me.

38:09.924 --> 38:12.109
Once I know something, I can't ignore it.

38:12.110 --> 38:14.495
So I'm going to learn
everything I can about magic.

38:14.496 --> 38:16.079
By giving up on school?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.415
Yeah, I think it might be
better if I'm somewhere

38:18.416 --> 38:21.084
I can't accidentally open
up dimensional rifts.

38:21.085 --> 38:24.922
You know, school isn't the
only thing you're giving up.

38:24.923 --> 38:27.758
Nothing's ever really
gonna be normal again.

38:27.759 --> 38:30.127
You gave up normal when
you became a Librarian,

38:30.128 --> 38:32.095
and you get eaten almost every week.

38:32.096 --> 38:35.132
Yeah, but I never had
normal to begin with.

38:35.133 --> 38:36.550
That's not really you.

38:36.551 --> 38:39.219
This cool, kick-ass
adventure Cassandra...

38:39.220 --> 38:40.971
that's who you really are.

38:40.972 --> 38:44.090
Sometimes you just have to jump.
You taught me that.

38:45.276 --> 38:47.478
Thank you.

38:47.479 --> 38:49.279
[Both chuckle]

38:49.280 --> 38:51.231
But don't worry.

38:51.232 --> 38:54.151
If I ever summon up another
otherworldly creature,

38:54.152 --> 38:55.235
I know who to call.

38:55.236 --> 38:56.320
[Clicks tongue]

38:56.321 --> 38:58.038
[Both chuckle]

38:58.039 --> 38:59.438
Bye.

39:04.078 --> 39:06.046
[Doors close]

39:06.047 --> 39:08.030
Hi.

39:16.057 --> 39:19.092
Did you finish your ritual?

39:19.093 --> 39:22.312
You burnt the sage and...

39:22.313 --> 39:24.431
closed the summoning circle for good?

39:24.432 --> 39:26.215
I did.

39:27.018 --> 39:30.103
What you did, however...

39:30.104 --> 39:31.572
far more dangerous.

39:31.573 --> 39:34.992
I can't convince Lucy to
stay away from magic.

39:34.993 --> 39:38.829
I know you disagree with that,
but... I think she's brave.

39:38.830 --> 39:41.230
This isn't about Lucy.

39:44.953 --> 39:46.920
There were three ladies.

39:46.921 --> 39:50.290
And they took you to the Lake.

39:50.291 --> 39:53.043
This is complicated.

39:53.044 --> 39:57.297
I take it it wasn't lost on you
that they stopped time...

39:57.298 --> 39:59.466
like Morgan Le Fay.

39:59.467 --> 40:02.168
And that you have now
garnered their attention.

40:04.472 --> 40:07.140
I got to admit...

40:07.141 --> 40:09.476
I was tempted by their offer.

40:09.477 --> 40:11.144
They're not afraid, like we are.

40:11.145 --> 40:12.613
[Scoffs]

40:12.614 --> 40:14.531
The Library has always been prudent.

40:14.532 --> 40:16.533
Prudence is not fear.

40:16.534 --> 40:20.537
But prudence isn't working, Mr. Jenkins.

40:20.538 --> 40:23.290
Magic is getting out there.
The Library can't stop it.

40:23.291 --> 40:26.408
We can't hide it anymore.

40:27.328 --> 40:29.546
The Lake...

40:29.547 --> 40:31.381
even Lucy...

40:31.382 --> 40:33.250
they're not afraid of changing times.

40:33.251 --> 40:34.500
Miss Cillian...

40:36.054 --> 40:38.422
Cassandra.

40:38.423 --> 40:40.223
You are not wrong.

40:40.224 --> 40:42.676
The world is changing.

40:42.677 --> 40:46.063
And there is a debate older than time

40:46.064 --> 40:48.682
about the best way to deal with magic.

40:48.683 --> 40:51.685
The Lake...

40:51.686 --> 40:54.303
They've always been ambitious.

40:56.774 --> 40:59.026
Now, you need to be on your guard

40:59.027 --> 41:00.559
for whatever happens next.

41:01.613 --> 41:03.729
"Whatever happens next"?

41:06.701 --> 41:09.503
Whatever happens next...

41:09.504 --> 41:12.571
please remember that I chose to stay.

41:16.010 --> 41:17.461
You know...

41:17.462 --> 41:22.349
for the first time, I feel
like I'm choosing my life...

41:22.350 --> 41:25.334
instead of running after
someone else's choices.

41:27.355 --> 41:29.077
I like this better.

41:37.439 --> 41:42.439
