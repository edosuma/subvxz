Armed police!

00:15.600 --> 00:17.090
Shoot over the suspect's body,

00:17.120 --> 00:18.724
in the direction
you'd have fired

00:18.760 --> 00:20.444
if you'd managed
to get here in time.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.249
- Jesus!
- We're all in this together.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.770
Best way.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.325
You shot that fella
in cold blood

00:29.360 --> 00:31.727
while your wee mates stood by
and watched.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.842
- What was that'?
- Interviews finished, Danny.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.043
- I'm not.
- Good. Neither are we.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.809
You know why
I've been appointed.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.888
To ensure that
anticorruption inquiries

00:42.920 --> 00:44.809
don't get pulled apart in court.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.929
Don't try playing the big man.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.440
We both know
you're not up to it.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.562
She definitely does.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.731
You need me to make
the hard choices for you.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.207
Because I see what's inside you.
Jelly.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.685
Putting Kate into an APO role

01:02.720 --> 01:05.325
is a level of jeopardy
above a normal undercover...

01:05.360 --> 01:07.203
I can handle it.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.922
The file on the suspect
shot by Waldron'?

01:11.960 --> 01:14.440
Yeah.
We need an unredacted file.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.641
Leave it to me.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.001
- You didn't know the suspect?
- No.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.327
ARNOTT: <i>Ronan Murphy.
The suspect's name.</i>

01:21.280 --> 01:23.442
- Don't remember me'?
- (Yam)

01:23.480 --> 01:26.643
The only thing with Ronan,
it was over too fast.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.323
<i>If there's something
bigger here,</i>

01:30.360 --> 01:32.727
<i>you don't want to be
left carrying the can.</i>

01:35.960 --> 01:37.689
<i>You better come up here,
Skipper.</i>

01:38.000 --> 01:39.684
On my Way-

01:40.960 --> 01:42.803
(Gunshot)

01:43.320 --> 01:45.129
Shot fired! Shot fired!

01:46.040 --> 01:47.690
(Whispers)

01:47.720 --> 01:49.529
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

01:49.560 --> 01:51.130
Stay with me, Danny.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.208
Danny. Danny!

01:53.240 --> 01:55.561
(Police radio in background)

01:58.480 --> 02:00.005
Come on, guys!

02:01.800 --> 02:03.404
Come away. Let them in.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.242
Come on, Kate.
Let's leave them to it.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.520
Let me in.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.527
Weak pulse right carotid.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.244
Left side's traumatised.
Probably tolerate a Guedel.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.408
Let's get suction on,
secure the airway.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.408
Oxygen and IV access.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.203
What the hell happened in there?

02:26.040 --> 02:27.530
I'm still in shock, guv.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.803
I just need a couple of minutes
to get my head round it.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.647
I'm still making sense of it,
guv.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.844
Get them to the station.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.363
You too, Francis.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.924
Maintaining pressure
on left submandibular GSW.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.082
(Siren starts)

03:15.160 --> 03:17.162
(Police radio in background)

03:21.400 --> 03:24.290
DS Arnott, AC-12.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.970
Is he talking?
I need to talk to him.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.287
The incident took place
inside the bedroom

03:28.320 --> 03:30.482
so it's off limits
except to preserve life.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.090
Single GSW to the neck.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.122
Sinus rhythm
but BP's in his boots.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.162
- Sats dropping.
- ls he gonna make it'?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.370
Stand by, everyone.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.129
You need to fill in
your pocketbooks,

03:42.160 --> 03:44.288
then there'll be a debrief.
Before you do anything,

03:44.320 --> 03:46.607
you'll be walked through
it all by Legal.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.404
Any news on Danny yet'?

03:48.440 --> 03:50.363
(Equipment beeping)

03:50.400 --> 03:53.449
Sinus bradia.
He's gone asystolic.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.166
Let's get him in.
OK. We're losing him.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.771
I've got asystole on the monitor
and no output.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.121
- Fluids wide open.
- Off vent and bag him.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.481
Stan CPR.
Adrenaline one milligram.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.290
Four cycles of CPR given.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.163
No output
with chest compressions.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.522
No carotid pulse.
Asystole on the monitor.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.644
Pronounced life extinct 08:34.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.962
Thanks, everybody.
Sorry about that.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.844
We need to leave everything
as is for the Coroner...

05:02.360 --> 05:04.647
ls anyone gonna tell me
what actually happened'?

05:04.680 --> 05:06.603
Jesus Christ, Kate.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.248
- There was a struggle.
- Who with'?

05:11.280 --> 05:13.089
We were all involved.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.691
Danny had his firearm out
and it just went off.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.200
- I didn't hear a struggle.
- You were downstairs.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.811
And from downstairs
I didn't hear a struggle.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.447
When I got upstairs, not one of
you was giving Danny first aid.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.482
What did Danny say to you'?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.523
He whispered something.
What did he say'?

05:31.560 --> 05:34.450
- I'm not sure what he meant.
- No, no. What did he...

05:34.480 --> 05:36.642
What did he actually say'?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.804
Just cos you didn't
hear a struggle,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.490
doesn't mean there wasn't one.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.045
Why didn't one of you
help Danny'?

05:43.080 --> 05:46.527
He was lying on the floor, shot,
and there was blood everywhere.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.131
- We were in shock.
- You couldn't lift a finger'?

05:49.160 --> 05:52.289
- Couldn't call for help'?
- Do we have to talk about this'?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.641
All I can see in my head
is Danny just lying there,

05:57.680 --> 06:00.001
bleeding out, man.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.883
- What was your RT about?
- What RT'?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.922
You radioed Danny,
telling him to come up.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.325
- Did I'?
- Yeah.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.850
You said, "Come up, Skipper."

06:06.880 --> 06:08.689
I'd have to hear the recording.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.290
There is no recording.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.243
Can you just stop'?

06:13.120 --> 06:15.248
Doing my head in.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.648
To go along with this, I need
to know what I'm covering for.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.448
Fine. The ballistics will say

06:25.480 --> 06:27.323
what really happened
in that bedroom.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.725
Yeah, you'd think.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.084
- Time, gaffer'?
- I say they've had plenty.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.042
(Low chatter)

06:51.320 --> 06:53.971
- (Bleeping)
- PC Francis.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.170
Sir.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.601
<i>Let's get straight down
to brass tacks.</i>

06:58.640 --> 07:01.371
<i>How did Sergeant Daniel Waldron
meet his death?</i>

07:02.240 --> 07:05.722
- He died in the ambulance, sir.
- You know exactly what I mean.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.047
Danny Waldron shot himself, sir.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.048
Danny put the gun
to his own head.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.969
We were trying to help him.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.923
But we...we couldn't get
the gun off him

07:14.960 --> 07:16.450
and the firearm discharged.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.563
When I entered the room,
Danny was bleeding profusely.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.570
- Did you administer first aid?
- Kate...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.809
erm, Victor Charlie Five Five...

07:25.840 --> 07:28.127
she ran in and she tried to
control the bleeding

07:28.160 --> 07:29.889
until the paramedics arrived.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.970
So you didn't...
administer first aid'?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.924
Well, you hope you'll know
what to do in them situations...

07:36.960 --> 07:38.450
till it comes to it.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.923
Uh-huh.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.091
Image 297.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.805
A ballistic simulation
of the bullets trajectory.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.241
It appears
the fatal shot was fired

07:48.280 --> 07:51.648
close to Sergeant Waldron's
chest and aimed upwards.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.489
That how it happened, Constable?

07:53.520 --> 07:54.965
Yes, sir.

07:55.320 --> 07:59.006
Forensics detected
firearms residue on your hands,

07:59.040 --> 08:02.010
Victor Charlie Five Four,
and the hands of your mates,

08:02.040 --> 08:04.566
Victor Charlie Five Two
and Five Three.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.206
So that would all seem to fit.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.843
Case closed.
We can all knock off early.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.009
There is an alternative
explanation

08:17.040 --> 08:19.691
as to why you had
your hands on that gun.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.041
As I said, sir, we were
trying to get it off him.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.641
You weren't trying to force that
firearm under Waldron's chin'?

08:25.680 --> 08:28.490
That's a horrible accusation.
We tried to save Danny.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.649
- Who grabbed the gun first?
- Hari did, sir. Sorry.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.642
Victor Charlie Five Four.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.524
I didn't even know that Danny
had drawn his gun...

08:39.559 --> 08:41.927
and the next minute
Hari's wrestling him for the gun

08:41.960 --> 08:43.485
and he's shouting,
"Danny, no!"

08:43.520 --> 08:45.329
and he's calling for
me and Rod to help.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.567
The three of us
fought over the gun.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.763
We did everything to try
and stop him. We just couldn't.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.802
Did he make
any kind of statement?

08:52.840 --> 08:55.127
He tried to say something.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.687
- What did he say'?
- I couldn't make it out, sir.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.449
Now, Daniel Waldron,
as you know,

09:02.480 --> 09:04.528
was involved in the shooting
of a suspect

09:04.560 --> 09:06.164
during Operation Damson.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.123
You and Victor Charlie Five Two
and Five Three

09:08.160 --> 09:10.288
were on his team
and witnessed what happened.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.322
Was Danny coercing you
into corroborating

09:12.360 --> 09:14.328
- his version of events?
- No.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.761
For the tape,
I am referring to a transcript

09:16.800 --> 09:19.280
of an interview with you
on May 21 st.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.210
DI Cottan and I asked you
if there were inaccuracies

09:22.240 --> 09:24.481
in your account of
Sergeant Waldron's shooting

09:24.520 --> 09:26.887
of Ronan Murphy,
to which you replied...

09:26.920 --> 09:30.322
"I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.170
No way am I testifying
against Danny Waldron."

09:33.200 --> 09:35.328
- No.
- How's about...

09:35.360 --> 09:37.601
Danny Waldron scared you
into covering for him

09:37.640 --> 09:39.722
and then the three of you
clubbed together

09:39.760 --> 09:41.842
- and put an end to it'?
- No, no.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.963
That's just not what happened.
Will you please stop'?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.970
- This is really upsetting.
- If Danny was threatening me,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.731
- I would have reported him.
- I just had to report him.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.250
He can be a difficult bastard,

09:52.280 --> 09:54.521
but on an op
you've got your skipper's back.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.403
We were trying to save him,
not hum him.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.762
Danny Waldron killed himself,
sir, that's the honest truth.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.450
Why, though'?

10:01.480 --> 10:04.051
He had his firearms licence,
he was operational again.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.050
As far as Waldron was concerned,
the case against him was closed.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.082
Who knows what was going on
in his head'?

10:09.120 --> 10:10.724
I was downstairs
at Abbott's Lane

10:10.760 --> 10:13.923
and didn't witness the incident
at the upstairs bedroom.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.528
Authorised Firearms Officer
Victor Charlie Five Two...

10:18.560 --> 10:21.450
...Victor Charlie Five Three...
..Victor Charlie Five Four...

10:21.480 --> 10:23.482
you have failed to give
a plausible account

10:23.520 --> 10:25.204
of the events
leading up to the death

10:25.240 --> 10:26.730
of Sergeant Daniel Waldron.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.525
Therefore, I am arresting you
on suspicion of his murder.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.722
You don't have to say anything,

10:31.760 --> 10:33.410
however,
it may harm your defence

10:33.440 --> 10:35.807
if you fail to mention something
under questioning

10:35.840 --> 10:38.207
that you later go on
to rely on in court.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.924
And, of course,
anything you do say

10:39.960 --> 10:42.691
may be taken down in evidence.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.850
I'm after a cell for a copper,

10:46.880 --> 10:48.644
somewhere where
no-one knows her.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.365
I need to arrange custody for
a police officer at a station

10:51.400 --> 10:53.482
where he isn't known. Now.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.727
I wonder if, on reflection,
you'd consider that

10:59.760 --> 11:02.286
perhaps you should have
run it by me first?

11:03.160 --> 11:05.845
Four coppers went into a room,
only three came out alive.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.803
That's what I considered.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.446
They've experienced
a tragic and shocking event.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.881
They've admitted that
they were too traumatised

11:12.920 --> 11:14.922
to even remember first aid.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.566
Their Police Federation reps
and their legal advisers

11:17.600 --> 11:20.001
are arguing that they were
sent back to work too soon

11:20.040 --> 11:21.451
after the Damson shooting.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.528
Their inspector's
getting it in the neck

11:23.560 --> 11:25.801
for not disbanding the squad,
and frankly...

11:25.840 --> 11:27.444
I think they've all got a point.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.848
But it was you
who vetoed their suspensions!

11:30.880 --> 11:33.611
I mean, they're only
back at work because of you.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.165
What steps have you taken

11:35.200 --> 11:37.202
to evaluate Danny Waldron's
mental state?

11:37.240 --> 11:39.766
Come on. You don't honestly
believe he killed himself?

11:39.800 --> 11:43.088
He had a history of professional
discord, no stable relationship.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.724
He certainly had risk factors.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.001
And he did it just like that,
in front of his squad,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.247
- in the middle of an op?
- We're speculating.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.362
What we know for sure
is that if you can't

11:51.400 --> 11:54.131
successfully charge them
in the next 36 hours,

11:54.160 --> 11:57.289
it will be a hugely embarrassing
climb-down.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.848
My sincere advice is to take
a more circumspect approach -

12:04.560 --> 12:06.244
Rescind the arrests

12:06.280 --> 12:08.521
in favour of revoking
their firearms permits

12:08.560 --> 12:10.164
and confining them
to desk duties

12:10.200 --> 12:12.680
- while inquiries continue.
- What?

12:15.120 --> 12:17.122
And that isn't a climb-down'?

12:25.760 --> 12:27.808
- Forget it.
- Scrap that.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.803
Let's not fall out, Ted.
I'm here to help.

12:33.640 --> 12:37.201
I should also emphasise the
importance of confidentiality.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.846
We already have a Legal
Suppression Order in place

12:39.880 --> 12:41.609
to restrict press coverage.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.210
The PCC
and the Chief Constable

12:43.240 --> 12:45.447
are in complete agreement
on this.

12:45.480 --> 12:49.246
In the absence of hard facts
around Danny Waldron's death,

12:50.040 --> 12:53.931
we don't want wild speculation
to affect public confidence.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.248
I mean, if you and the PCC
and the Chief Constable

12:57.280 --> 13:01.365
are all in agreement...
who am I to argue?

13:20.120 --> 13:21.770
Let there be
no misunderstanding.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.768
I do not care
what the lawyer says.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.121
We are going to investigate
that mob.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.209
Sir.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.126
Sir, I don't think we should
close the investigation

13:34.160 --> 13:36.242
into Danny Waldron's background.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.851
Hari Bains was right.
Danny had his demons.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.522
I'd like to keep digging.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.843
Thank you, sir.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.882
(Whining)

13:49.280 --> 13:51.282
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

13:55.800 --> 13:57.962
- Check upstairs.
- Armed police!

13:58.840 --> 14:00.888
Armed police!

14:04.320 --> 14:05.810
All clear.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.726
Sarge.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.566
- Hello.
- (Rosie whines)

14:23.600 --> 14:26.331
No-one said anything about
Danny Waldron having a dog.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.002
He didn't.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.248
(Phone rings)

14:37.280 --> 14:39.362
- AC-12.
- Sorry, who's that'?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.004
PC Maneet Bindra.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.804
- I've been posted...
- It's DS Arnott.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.365
I'm trying to track
a dog's owner.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.482
The number on its collar
is out of service.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.170
If you give me the number,
sarge,

14:48.200 --> 14:50.089
I'll try and get you a lead.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.321
<i>07700900381.</i>

14:56.040 --> 14:57.644
Just get it done.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.481
MAN: Item reference SJP-2,
Daniel Waldron's handset.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.640
I've got a firearm in here!
No-one enter!

15:27.960 --> 15:30.645
We need someone firearms-trained
to make safe.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.286
- Jonesy's downstairs.
- Yes, sir.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.286
Jonesy! Guv wants you. Firearm.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.202
- Sir.
- All yours, Jonesy.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.201
We seized a lap-top and a phone.

16:07.240 --> 16:10.483
We won't have any more info
on Danny Waldron's data files

16:10.520 --> 16:12.682
- till the morning.
- Right.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.210
- Grab a seat.
- Cheers.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.484
OK, illegal firearm,
no information on its origin.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.444
Plus the case and its contents.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.245
Storage receipt,
trying to trace.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.965
Photo.
Looking into this an' all.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.809
And this.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.128
- What was in it'?
- Nothing.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.889
An envelope with nothing inside?

16:35.920 --> 16:37.843
That's what the report says.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.850
So, look. We need to have
a quick operational briefing.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.884
Right, you're following leads
on Danny Waldron,

16:43.920 --> 16:46.400
which means I'm after Bains,
Brickford and Kennedy.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.842
- That sound about right to you'?
- Yeah. Good.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.087
As Kate's undercover's
on my side of the line,

16:52.120 --> 16:55.408
is there any probs
if I look after liaison?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.482
Um... (Clears throat)

16:59.160 --> 17:01.322
What'? I thought you'd be happy,
you know.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.203
Avoid skulking about
in dark alleys.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.730
Yeah, it's just...

17:04.760 --> 17:07.286
Kate and I have worked together
for three years now.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.608
- And you've got a partnership.
- Yeah, exactly.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.682
Look, I get it.

17:12.720 --> 17:16.202
But like I said, it's on my side
of the investigation.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.930
- All right'?
- All right'?

17:29.960 --> 17:31.689
- This'll warm your cookies.
- Ta.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.643
Steve never bought refreshments.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.603
Look, there's not really
much to report.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.085
- It's early days.
- It's just...

17:37.120 --> 17:39.521
Gaffer's got me on the trail of
the Three Wise Monkeys.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.608
Well, now all three of them
are Speak No Evil.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.563
It's up to you to change
all that, isn't it'?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.489
- No pressure.
- No pressure.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.488
What did Waldron say'?

17:47.520 --> 17:49.648
- When'?
- His dying words.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.806
Word.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.128
He started to say, "Listen..."
and that was all he got out.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.209
- Why'?
- Just curious.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.686
I noticed your reaction to me
in the interview.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.166
Did I say something
that didn't hit the right note?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.885
Just...you're a brilliant liar.
That's all.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.490
Kind of unsettled me.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.527
- Thanks for the drink.
- Any time.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.722
- Night, Dot.
- Night.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.242
(Phone buzzes)

18:31.080 --> 18:32.684
- Arnott.
- It's Maneet, sarge.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.484
Sorry to bother you,

18:34.520 --> 18:36.329
but that out-of-service number

18:36.360 --> 18:38.203
relates to
a discontinued account.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.244
The dog owner must not have
updated the information.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.601
<i>It's a Linus Murphy.
Lives locally.</i>

18:45.000 --> 18:46.843
- Did you say Murphy'?
- Yes, sarge.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.647
Right. Text me the address
and organise some armed back-up.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.364
Will do, sarge.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.003
- Work.
- It's all right.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.371
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.362
- (Door crashes open)
- Armed police!

19:09.320 --> 19:11.322
Anyone home'?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.242
We've found your dog.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.402
Check upstairs.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.367
Don't... Don't come in.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.162
Call for a Forensic Deployment.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.646
Keep checking
for other casualties.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.561
- Sir.
- All right?

20:26.040 --> 20:28.008
There's evidence
of prolonged torture.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.610
Cause of death isn't clear.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.563
Cutting his head off
can't have helped.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.284
Lack of blood from the neck
means...

20:33.320 --> 20:35.687
Joke. I'm a bloody
Detective Inspector.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.722
I can tell he was decapitated
post-modem.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.489
It can't have been
to conceal his ID.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.249
The premises
are full of evidence

20:41.280 --> 20:42.611
confirming who he is.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.086
Going through the findings
in Danny Waldron's flat,

20:45.120 --> 20:47.248
the receipt relates to
a storage company.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.964
Danny left something
for us to find'?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.606
I'm liaising with the company
to find out which facility

20:51.640 --> 20:53.404
- the receipt originates from.
- Good.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.323
Danny's
telecommunications history

20:55.360 --> 20:57.931
is very quiet in the days
leading up to his death.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.327
There's only one contact
that stands out.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.091
A call from a mobile
lasting only two seconds,

21:03.120 --> 21:05.885
and then a text message
from this same mobile number.

21:06.720 --> 21:09.041
- You got ID on the contact?
- The service provider

21:09.080 --> 21:10.764
has disclosed
the registered user.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.928
I'm just cross-checking
with the DVLA

21:12.960 --> 21:15.725
to see if the driving licence
photocard matches the selfie.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.524
- Well done. Well done.
- The hard drive

21:17.560 --> 21:19.085
of Danny Waldron's work computer

21:19.120 --> 21:21.168
hasn't revealed
anything suspicious yet.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.407
Same goes for
the domestic lap-top we seized,

21:23.440 --> 21:25.761
and I'm still trying to trace
this photo.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.331
Good work. Let me know

21:29.360 --> 21:32.443
when you've got the info
on the storage facility.

21:48.520 --> 21:52.286
All right'? Must be nice having
this extra energy to work off.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.810
Is that supposed to be funny'?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.330
I've swerved desk duties,

21:55.360 --> 21:57.840
but AC-12 will keep after
all of you, me included.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.564
You can't run away from them.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.931
Really?

22:00.960 --> 22:03.486
Is that why they've had to
back off arresting us'?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.880
That's cos they haven't got
enough evidence yet.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.571
That'll change when they know
about Hari's radio call.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.011
Yeah'?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.646
Well...the only way
they'll know about that

22:13.680 --> 22:16.160
- is if you tell them.
- Or Hari does.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.964
He seems pretty nervous to me.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.083
We went into the room.
There was no-one there.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.241
We had to get a steer
on whether to look for firearms

22:24.280 --> 22:25.770
or to call in
for a search team.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.450
It didn't sound like that to me.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.131
Hari said, "Better come up
here," like there was trouble.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.162
That put Danny on edge.
He drew his firearm.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.646
- OK, so'?
- Someone was entrapping Danny.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.728
You know something, Kate'?

22:38.480 --> 22:39.970
You don't know a thing.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.682
DS Arnott.
We spoke on the phone.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.966
I've got this receipt here.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.882
Step back, please.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.011
- Must have made a right whiff.
- Yeah.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.250
- Sir.
- Yeah.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.487
Looks like this is Linus
Murphy's missing head.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.921
Although we're just waiting on
full forensics.

24:39.800 --> 24:43.771
- And the postmortem?
- Report came through earlier.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.610
Multiple serious cutting and
gouging wounds to the chest,

24:46.640 --> 24:49.246
abdomen, genitals and anus.
The cause of death

24:49.280 --> 24:51.851
was internal haemorrhaging
due to a pelvic fracture.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.087
No prints or fibres were found
on the implements

24:54.120 --> 24:55.565
or the body or at the premises.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.410
So it's still not possible to
pin the murder on Danny Waldron.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.124
However...

25:00.160 --> 25:02.606
The photograph shows
Danny Waldron as a teenager.

25:02.640 --> 25:06.406
And facial recognition software
gives a 99.5% likelihood

25:06.440 --> 25:08.408
this man's a young
Ronan Murphy-

25:08.440 --> 25:10.010
the suspect
shot by Danny Waldron

25:10.040 --> 25:12.520
- during Operation Damson.
- They knew each other?

25:12.560 --> 25:14.210
And he bears
a strong resemblance

25:14.240 --> 25:15.844
to Linus Murphy's severed head.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.564
Danny knew him, too.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.524
What the hell are they doing in
a photograph with Waldron'?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.927
I'll update
when I've got more facts, sir.

25:22.960 --> 25:25.725
Now... There's nothing
inside the envelope,

25:25.760 --> 25:29.162
but I believe that's because
Danny met his death prematurely.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.522
All these mementos would seem
to be clues to his activities,

25:32.560 --> 25:35.530
and I reckon at some point he
intended to include something

25:35.560 --> 25:37.801
- more in the envelope.
- That makes sense.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.367
- Yes'?
- The ID checks out

25:41.400 --> 25:44.563
on Danny Waldron's last contact,
Rachel O'Connor.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.602
Thanks, Maneet.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.722
Good work, Steve. Carry on.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.721
Yeah. Nice one.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.286
May I ask, what is - or was -
your relationship

26:18.320 --> 26:19.845
with Sergeant Danny Waldron'?

26:21.120 --> 26:23.407
We met on a night out.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.721
He was with a bunch
of his police mates.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.210
Analysis of Danny's
phone records

26:29.240 --> 26:31.527
reveals a call from
your mobile phone to his

26:31.560 --> 26:33.961
lasting a couple of seconds.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.490
That was the night we met.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.568
I was giving him
my phone number.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.404
I'm sorry to pry, but it may
help our investigation

26:41.440 --> 26:43.807
to know the extent
of your relationship.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.605
We had a couple of drinks
and he walked me home.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.243
He didn't come inside.

26:49.280 --> 26:52.011
Thank you. You sent him
a text message?

26:52.040 --> 26:55.203
A couple of days later.
I hadn't heard from him.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.847
- When did you see him again'?
- I didn't.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.249
Did he seem troubled to you,

27:02.280 --> 27:04.601
or concerned about
something in particular'?

27:05.240 --> 27:07.641
No. We were having
a good time.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.329
I was disappointed
he never got back to me.

27:12.360 --> 27:13.885
Why'?

27:13.920 --> 27:16.366
He seemed very lonely.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.362
I thought he needed
to make a connection.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.368
Seems like I was wrong.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.050
You're not wrong.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.082
How is he'? ls he OK'?

27:28.800 --> 27:30.768
I'm very sorry, miss.

27:30.800 --> 27:34.088
A few days ago, Danny Waldron
was killed in the line of duty.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.321
<i>Hi, this is Sam.
Please leave a message.</i>

28:08.360 --> 28:09.771
<i>(Beep)</i>

28:09.800 --> 28:11.882
Hi. I'm working late.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.968
I just wanted to say...

28:15.960 --> 28:17.962
I'm lucky to have you.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.442
See you when I get home.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.169
Steve?

28:33.200 --> 28:35.362
There's really no point
you being here.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.402
I know.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.041
<i>My Lady,
The Prosecution applies for</i>

28:42.080 --> 28:43.570
<i>Public Interest immunity</i>

28:43.600 --> 28:45.841
in order that
Detective Sergeant Arnott

28:45.880 --> 28:49.123
be exempted from testifying
in respect of this matter.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.369
Disclosures of covert tactics
in open court

28:52.400 --> 28:55.882
will undermine current
and future police operations.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.285
Detective Sergeant Arnott

28:57.320 --> 29:00.563
conducted an undercover
investigation that was, and is,

29:00.600 --> 29:02.762
of the utmost sensitivity.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.768
Some of this evidence
was the subject

29:04.800 --> 29:07.007
of the defendant's
successful appeal

29:07.040 --> 29:10.328
to be retried for her
original convictions.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.440
The application is refused.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.886
Sorry.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.606
We tried. You're gonna
have to face her again.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.402
(Keys rattling)

29:36.320 --> 29:38.766
Stand away from the door!

29:59.240 --> 30:02.483
- You all right, Jacks'?
- Yeah. You all right, guv'?

30:02.520 --> 30:05.205
- Are you feeling OK'?
Yeah.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.010
It's just been a rough
couple of weeks, that's all.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.804
Yeah.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.528
(spits)

30:26.040 --> 30:29.089
Detective Sergeant Arnott,
please would you tell the court

30:29.120 --> 30:31.691
how you came to be involved
in the investigation

30:31.720 --> 30:33.449
surrounding the defendant?

30:33.480 --> 30:36.245
I was, and still am,
a serving detective in AC-12.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.170
On September 5th, 2013,

30:39.200 --> 30:41.851
there was an attempt on the life
of a protected witness,

30:41.880 --> 30:43.530
John Thomas Hunter.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.050
A police convoy was ambushed,

30:45.080 --> 30:47.651
causing the deaths
of three police officers.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.091
AC-12 was assigned

30:49.120 --> 30:51.600
to investigate the possibility
of police complicity

30:51.640 --> 30:53.881
in the conspiracy
to assassinate Hunter.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.844
Our enquiries focused on
the officer who led the convoy

30:56.880 --> 30:58.644
and was the sole survivor.

30:58.680 --> 31:01.331
And this officer
was the defendant?

31:04.240 --> 31:07.801
Yes. Former Detective
Inspector Lindsay Dent-an.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.204
Thank you.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.205
Detective Sergeant Arnott,

31:15.240 --> 31:18.210
did you give evidence at
the defendant's original trial?

31:18.240 --> 31:19.401
Yes, I did.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.442
Was there any
significant evidence

31:21.480 --> 31:23.244
discovered at
the defendant's home'?

31:23.280 --> 31:25.282
A hidden sum of cash was found.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.368
Found where exactly?

31:27.400 --> 31:30.131
In some items belonging to
the defendant's late mother.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.280
Specifically,
the overnight case.

31:34.080 --> 31:37.050
How did that make its way
to the defendant's bedroom'?

31:37.080 --> 31:39.560
- I carried it up for her.
- Why'?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.762
I was carrying out
an undercover operation

31:41.800 --> 31:43.450
to investigate the defendant.

31:43.480 --> 31:46.643
And who authorised
this undercover operation?

31:46.680 --> 31:49.524
My commanding officer,
Superintendent Hastings.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.766
When?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.962
The operation
was authorised retroactively.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.571
After you carried the case
belonging to the defendant's

31:55.600 --> 31:57.682
late mother up to the bedroom,
what did you do'?

31:57.720 --> 32:00.246
I offered my sympathies,
and I turned the conversation

32:00.280 --> 32:02.521
towards the events
surrounding the conspiracy

32:02.560 --> 32:04.369
to murder Tommy Hunter.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.767
Did you ever spend a night
at the defendant's house?

32:06.800 --> 32:09.007
- No, I did not.
- Pan of a night?

32:10.320 --> 32:12.926
- Yes.
- Until what time?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.410
Three...four in the morning.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.523
If you're unsure of the exact
time, Detective Sergeant,

32:18.560 --> 32:21.086
you may refer to
your pocketbook.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.364
You did record
in your pocketbook

32:24.400 --> 32:26.562
every time you stayed
with the defendant?

32:26.600 --> 32:29.410
No. I was undercover.
If she sneaked a look at it,

32:29.440 --> 32:31.522
she would have found out
what I was up to.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.369
What were you doing
with the defendant

32:33.400 --> 32:35.607
until three or four
in the morning'?

32:35.640 --> 32:37.688
Talking.
My undercover operation

32:37.720 --> 32:39.848
was designed to win
the defendant's trust.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.486
You were
endeavouring to create

32:42.520 --> 32:45.410
a close personal relationship
with the defendant?

32:45.440 --> 32:47.329
No, only to create
the appearance

32:47.360 --> 32:49.727
of a close relationship.
I was working.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.081
Are there any specific
operational rules

32:52.120 --> 32:54.202
associated with
an undercover operation

32:54.240 --> 32:56.720
with respect to the closeness
of such a relationship?

32:56.760 --> 32:57.886
Yes.

32:57.920 --> 33:01.003
Would a sexual relationship
be acceptable

33:01.040 --> 33:02.565
during an undercover operation?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.125
Under current guidelines, no.

33:04.160 --> 33:07.482
Was that the reason
you didn't seek authorisation

33:07.520 --> 33:09.010
for your undercover operation?

33:09.040 --> 33:11.247
My Lady,
we've already established

33:11.280 --> 33:14.090
that the operation was
authorised retrospectively.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.248
Move on, Ms Hepburn.

33:18.360 --> 33:22.331
How many times were you alone
with the defendant in her home'?

33:22.360 --> 33:24.806
- About a dozen.
- At this time,

33:24.840 --> 33:27.002
was the case against
the defendant going well'?

33:27.040 --> 33:28.371
It was work in progress.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.051
But you needed a key piece of
evidence to crack the case'?

33:31.080 --> 33:33.321
My job is to find
any and all evidence.

33:33.960 --> 33:38.568
Would you please remind
the court who found the cash'?

33:38.600 --> 33:40.090
A forensic search team.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.645
Led by whom'?

33:44.600 --> 33:45.886
Me.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.162
No further questions.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.442
Is it true'?

34:05.480 --> 34:07.482
- What?
- Don't.

34:09.400 --> 34:10.969
No.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.327
I didn't have sex with her.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.362
- But'?
- But nothing.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.402
- Nothing'?
- No.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.244
Right.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.726
We've both had relationships,
you just as much as me.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.569
I don't dredge up
your old boyfriends.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.920
- None of them were suspects.
- It was before we met.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.531
You're protesting a lot for
someone who didn't shag her.

34:31.560 --> 34:34.643
Because I did stuff back then.
I'm different now.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.802
I only want to be with you.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.962
We good'?

34:50.120 --> 34:51.724
Yeah.

34:53.280 --> 34:56.443
I can guarantee you 110%

34:56.480 --> 34:58.767
none of my people
would plant evidence.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.121
They know I would
throw the book at them.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.003
Followed by the bookshelf.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.884
I know you would, Ted.
Maybe this'll cheer you up.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.724
Peace offering.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.842
An unredacted file
on Ronan Murphy,

35:10.880 --> 35:13.565
the suspect shot dead
by Danny Waldron.

35:13.600 --> 35:17.207
I have been shifting
heaven and earth...

35:17.240 --> 35:19.004
Now you don't have to.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.769
Well, thank you, Gill.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.768
Thank you very, very much.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.643
Ted, people are gunning
for AC-12.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.170
I'm trying to make sure they get

35:26.200 --> 35:28.407
as little ammunition
as possible.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.048
I appreciate your efforts,
of course.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.609
I've got a table booked
across town.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.290
A girlfriend's
cancelled on me,

35:35.320 --> 35:36.924
if you want to
take the edge off'?

35:38.360 --> 35:40.169
Er...

35:40.200 --> 35:42.601
No, I think I'd better
go home to the wife.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.529
OK.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.562
But thanks for the file.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.129
Is this really the way
you want it to go'?

36:32.160 --> 36:34.447
Hari and Jackie are leading you
up the garden path.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.960
- Nobody's doing nothing.
- This was a new posting for me.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.207
Look what I've walked into.
It's doing my head in.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.005
- How do you think I'm feeling'?
- It must be ten times worse.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.804
You'd think better of Jackie,
wouldn't you'?

36:45.840 --> 36:48.605
The little looks.
The water works.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.450
If I can see there's something
going on between you two,

36:51.480 --> 36:52.811
I can't be the only one.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.241
You're putting two and two
together and getting 400.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.408
First one to come clean
to AC-12...

36:57.440 --> 36:59.169
they always
get off the lightest.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.363
If it isn't gonna be you,
then maybe it'll be me.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.089
What did he say
before he died'?

37:07.120 --> 37:09.122
I don't know.
I couldn't work it out.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.685
Bollocks.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.846
Let's just say,
I know what's going on.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.368
This won't just be your career
up the spout.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.006
This will be
a long stint inside.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.566
Plenty of time to wonder if
covering for Hari and Jackie

37:22.600 --> 37:24.602
was your smartest move.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.086
And prison's such a lovely place
for a copper.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.723
Hari.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.087
All right, bud. Give a bloke
some peace, will you'?

37:55.120 --> 37:58.920
This is getting out of hand.
We need to talk. Yeah'?

37:59.880 --> 38:02.121
Yeah'?
Not here, though, right. I'll...

38:02.160 --> 38:05.448
I'll figure out
a place and a time. Yeah'?

38:12.440 --> 38:14.442
(Computer chimes)

38:23.520 --> 38:25.727
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.331
Sir, I've got all the forensics
in on Linus Murphy.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.044
And'?

38:31.360 --> 38:33.567
The head's been identified
as Linus Murphy's

38:33.600 --> 38:35.204
based on DNA
and dental records,

38:35.240 --> 38:37.925
and matched to the body
found at Linus Murphy's address.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.724
Forensic examination of the head

38:39.760 --> 38:42.604
has also provided the missing
link to Danny Waldron.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.971
Cells in the mouth
that match Waldron's DNA.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.005
Cells?

38:48.040 --> 38:49.565
Semen cells.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.690
And now we know why
he wanted to chop the head off.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.766
You did right to question
Waldron's private life.

39:02.600 --> 39:07.003
Mind you...l never had the man
pegged as a homosexual.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.725
I'm not sure
that's necessarily true, sir.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.602
The unredacted file
on Ronan Murphy.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.324
Thank you, sir.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.730
I haven't read anything in it
that changes my understanding.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.524
But take it.
You might find something.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.688
- On you go.
- Sir.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.720
What's that, then'?

39:44.760 --> 39:47.684
Gaffer finally got us
the file on Ronan Murphy.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.449
Dead end.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.130
Hey up, buddy.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.650
How's it going'?
You all right'?

40:42.680 --> 40:44.091
I don't know about you,

40:44.120 --> 40:45.929
but I ain't slept
in God knows how long.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.250
Yeah, I know.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.247
Just trying not to show it
to the missus.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.084
It's horrible, isn't it'?

40:55.120 --> 40:58.090
I don't see any way of getting
through to the other side.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.484
What other side'?

41:00.520 --> 41:03.000
Well, AC-12
dropping the investigation.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.770
Going back to work and that.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.164
Like nothing ever happened, eh'?

41:08.200 --> 41:10.726
Well, no, I didn't mean it
like that, did I'?

41:16.400 --> 41:17.970
Look, erm...

41:18.880 --> 41:21.360
I've been talking to my...
to my rep...

41:21.400 --> 41:22.925
and the legal adviser.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.242
I ain't told them anything.

41:28.760 --> 41:32.242
I need this job.
I need my pension.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.044
People are putting
two and two together.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.320
Wait. What people'?

41:35.360 --> 41:37.681
Danny managed to say something.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.684
Kate knows what happened.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.724
- Yeah, but how can she, though?
- I don't know.

41:43.760 --> 41:47.924
I don't know. But if anyone's
in the frame, it's me.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.327
Listen, mate, look,
we've got to sit tight.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.250
If Kate knows about me
and Jackie and Danny...

41:54.240 --> 41:55.730
I've got to come clean to AC-12.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.489
The longer I leave it,
the worse it looks.

41:57.520 --> 42:00.569
Mate, I've got a little 'un...
and another one on the way.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.001
It wasn't my idea
to lie through our teeth!

42:03.040 --> 42:04.769
Yeah, but we had to lie, though.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.609
Cos the truth makes us
sound guilty.

42:06.640 --> 42:10.042
And we're not guilty, are we'?
It was us or him, weren't it'?

42:10.080 --> 42:11.684
It wasn't us.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.402
It was you!

42:21.520 --> 42:23.682
Look where it's got us!

42:24.720 --> 42:27.087
A career up the spout.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.764
A stint inside.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.282
That's a great place
for a copper.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.127
(Electric bell ringing)

42:46.160 --> 42:48.162
(Bell stops ringing)

42:54.320 --> 42:56.891
The defence
calls Lindsay Denton.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.811
"I do solemnly, sincerely
and truly declare and affirm

43:11.840 --> 43:14.127
that the evidence I shall give
will be the truth,

43:14.160 --> 43:17.209
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

43:24.840 --> 43:28.731
Ms Denton, last year
you were convicted in this court

43:28.760 --> 43:31.525
because ten out of 12 jurors
were sure you'd conspired

43:31.560 --> 43:35.565
in the murder of a protected
witness, John Thomas Hunter.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.762
Would you tell this jury

43:38.800 --> 43:41.610
whether you were guilty
of that crime'?

43:41.640 --> 43:45.645
No, I had nothing to do with
the murder of Tommy Hunter.

43:47.640 --> 43:49.927
We've heard from
Detective Sergeant Arnott

43:49.960 --> 43:52.531
that one important item
of evidence against you

43:52.560 --> 43:56.087
was a sum of approximately
£50,000 in cash

43:56.120 --> 43:57.690
found at your home.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.803
Te the best of your knowledge,
how was that evidence found?

44:00.840 --> 44:02.729
I have full knowledge
of how it was found,

44:02.760 --> 44:04.762
as I was present at the time.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.251
Detective Constable Kate Fleming
led me upstairs,

44:08.280 --> 44:10.442
where a team of
forensic scene investigators

44:10.480 --> 44:12.084
led by Detective Sergeant Arnott

44:12.120 --> 44:14.327
were in the process of
searching my bedroom.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.731
Detective Sergeant Arnott
remarked upon the fact

44:17.760 --> 44:21.287
I'd shown a peculiar interest
in my mum's personal belongings.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.810
Peculiar in what way'?

44:22.840 --> 44:25.320
Detective Sergeant Arnott
remarked that I'd been

44:25.360 --> 44:28.091
anxious about Mum's things
not being returned to me.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.929
Were you'?

44:29.960 --> 44:33.009
I was devastated by her death.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.729
The thought of them being lost
was heart-breaking.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.889
I kept them in that room
and I didn't even touch them.

44:41.360 --> 44:44.091
I didn't even try to move them.
I just...

44:44.960 --> 44:46.928
As long as they were there...

44:48.360 --> 44:51.011
somehow it felt to me
that my mum was there.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.641
Are you OK to carry on,
Ms Denton?

45:03.640 --> 45:05.290
Yes.

45:05.320 --> 45:07.721
You were recalling that
Detective Sergeant Arnott

45:07.760 --> 45:09.330
was leading a forensic search...

45:09.360 --> 45:11.886
He asked one of
the forensic search team

45:11.920 --> 45:14.207
to open Mum's overnight case.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.242
And what was found in the case'?

45:16.920 --> 45:19.287
A large number of banknotes.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.210
Had you ever seen
these banknotes before?

45:22.240 --> 45:24.766
- Never.
- How did you react?

45:24.800 --> 45:27.201
Astonished. Devastated.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.970
Confused.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.846
And how did
Detective Sergeant Arnott react?

45:33.880 --> 45:35.484
He didn't bat an eye.

45:36.160 --> 45:40.961
He didn't seem surprised...
or curious or triumphant?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.684
No.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.848
How would you describe
your relationship

45:44.880 --> 45:47.486
with Detective Sergeant Arnott
up until that point'?

45:47.520 --> 45:49.284
I thought we'd become friends.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.448
You became close'?

45:52.800 --> 45:54.290
Yes.

45:54.320 --> 45:57.403
An undercover officer is
forbidden from sexual relations

45:57.440 --> 45:59.602
with a person
that they are investigating...

45:59.640 --> 46:03.167
My Lady, the investigating
officer's relationship

46:03.200 --> 46:05.123
with the defendant
has no bearing

46:05.160 --> 46:08.801
on the abundant and powerful
evidence against her.

46:08.840 --> 46:12.128
My Lady, an undercover officer
must abide by a code of conduct.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.049
Failure to follow
that code of conduct

46:14.080 --> 46:15.809
implies that there
are other rules

46:15.840 --> 46:19.128
- he might be prepared to break.
- I'll allow the question.

46:25.080 --> 46:28.004
While undercover
and investigating you,

46:29.240 --> 46:32.642
did Steve Arnott engage in
sexual relations with you'?

46:35.360 --> 46:37.169
Yes.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.567
On how many occasions?

46:41.960 --> 46:43.962
Once.

46:46.080 --> 46:50.608
I was very vulnerable...
following my mum's death.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.567
He seemed like
the only person in the world

46:54.600 --> 46:57.604
who understood
what I was going through.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.449
Sorry.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.448
And as a police officer,

47:02.480 --> 47:05.689
what conclusion
did you draw from that

47:05.720 --> 47:08.929
regarding Steve Arnott's
relationship with you'?

47:08.960 --> 47:11.964
That, as sexual relations
are forbidden,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.004
he couldn't be undercover
or investigating me any more.

47:15.040 --> 47:19.648
Er... How many times
was Steve Arnott in your house?

47:19.680 --> 47:21.205
I'd say a dozen.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.891
But you were always there
at the same time, weren't you'?

47:23.920 --> 47:26.127
I wasn't sleeping
very well at night.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.561
Sometimes I'd doze off
on the sofa

47:28.600 --> 47:32.002
and wake up and a couple of
hours would have gone by.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.769
And he'd been there
the whole time?

47:33.800 --> 47:35.643
Yes.

47:35.680 --> 47:38.490
But you had no idea
where in the house he'd been

47:38.520 --> 47:40.124
or what he'd been doing'?

47:41.480 --> 47:42.606
No.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.689
With access to your
late mother's belongings'?

47:47.920 --> 47:49.922
Yeah.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.802
Thank you, Ms Denton.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.684
My Lady...

47:59.720 --> 48:01.404
Yes, let's leave it there
for today.

48:01.440 --> 48:02.851
USHER: All rise.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.802
(Low chatter)

48:29.640 --> 48:31.642
(Keys rattling)

48:33.840 --> 48:35.842
(Door clunks shut)

48:43.840 --> 48:45.842
DS Arnott.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.722
Shut the door.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.403
Remain standing.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.327
Did you have sexual relations
with a suspect

49:05.360 --> 49:07.124
you were investigating
undercover'?

49:07.160 --> 49:09.162
Denton will say anything
to con the jury.

49:09.200 --> 49:12.727
- Did you or didn't you'?
- No, sir, I did not.

49:13.720 --> 49:16.326
- If that's your answer...
- It is my answer, sir.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.526
She says when the money was
found, you didn't bat an eye.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.927
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.928
Why would that be, now'?

49:26.960 --> 49:28.883
The search team
had established the find

49:28.920 --> 49:30.968
prior to Denton
entering the premises.

49:31.880 --> 49:34.565
I ordered them to simulate
making the find in front of her.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.489
To see her reaction.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.408
You make the find,
you show her.

49:39.440 --> 49:42.205
There's your reaction there!
You were show-boating!

49:42.240 --> 49:44.527
- Yes, sir.
- I'll give you "yes, sir".

49:44.560 --> 49:47.131
The defence are using this
to discredit your work

49:47.160 --> 49:48.889
and the work of this department!

49:48.920 --> 49:51.924
Your team was bossing the game.
You gave away a penalty!

49:52.640 --> 49:54.642
- Sir.
- Get the hell out of here!

50:03.600 --> 50:05.682
(Phone rings)

50:05.720 --> 50:07.722
Superintendent Hastings.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.282
- Sir.
- Sir.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.762
Mother of God.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.002
(Rope creaking)

50:44.840 --> 50:48.640
Who's in charge here'? I want
a preview of the forensics.

50:53.560 --> 50:55.767
It is with deep regret
that I inform you all...

50:57.120 --> 50:59.122
...of the death of
PC Rod Kennedy.

51:00.240 --> 51:03.323
Rod's body was found hanged
at an industrial unit.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.921
Early indications are
that he took his own life.

51:06.960 --> 51:09.440
There'll be a book of condolence
in the squad room,

51:09.480 --> 51:11.209
and we'll send out information

51:11.240 --> 51:14.528
for those of you who want to
send flowers and cards...

51:38.320 --> 51:40.322
ls there anything I can do'?

51:42.640 --> 51:44.642
I'll be fine.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.445
Here you are.

51:58.160 --> 52:00.970
Did you have any idea
he'd do something like that'?

52:01.560 --> 52:03.562
Did you'?

52:07.960 --> 52:09.644
This has gone too far.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.442
(Doorbell rings)

52:21.360 --> 52:23.169
We need to talk.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.726
- Jackie, it's late.
- I'm not leaving.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.170
Everything all right'?

52:46.200 --> 52:48.202
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.930
Kate, I read your report.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.122
You had nothing
on Rod Kennedy.

52:54.640 --> 52:57.120
The last thing that Danny said
to me before he died was,

52:57.160 --> 52:59.606
"Listen."
That was all he could get out.

52:59.640 --> 53:02.371
You weren't to know
how bad he'd fall for the bluff.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.607
That's why I'm asking
if you're OK.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.802
I'm just doing my job, mate.

53:22.200 --> 53:24.202
Well done, Kate.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.482
JACKIE: Rod and I were involved.

53:36.840 --> 53:39.207
HASTINGS: An affair...

53:39.240 --> 53:42.767
between two armed officers
serving side by side?

53:42.800 --> 53:46.805
That is a serious lack of
professionalism, Constable.

53:46.840 --> 53:48.444
Yes, sir.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.770
We kept the relationship hidden
or we'd have been disciplined.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.689
Were you still involved
with Rod Kennedy

53:54.720 --> 53:56.768
- at the time of his death?
- No.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.201
We'd broken up
a couple of months before.

53:59.240 --> 54:01.129
Why'?

54:05.760 --> 54:07.808
Something happened
between me and Danny.

54:07.840 --> 54:10.525
What happened
between you and Danny'?

54:12.080 --> 54:14.321
It was a one-night thing.

54:16.040 --> 54:17.849
Rod found out about it.

54:18.960 --> 54:21.486
Him and Danny had a bust-up.
Danny was...

54:24.000 --> 54:26.321
Danny was in the habit
of making remarks...

54:27.440 --> 54:28.851
...undermining Rod.

54:28.880 --> 54:31.850
Rod was really jealous.
He couldn't handle it.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.723
<i>Why did Danny Waldron
draw his firearm?</i>

54:33.760 --> 54:35.489
I don't know.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.965
We didn't do anything
and there was...

54:39.000 --> 54:41.844
nothing to suggest
he was in any kind of danger.

54:42.960 --> 54:46.931
So I can only imagine he was...
spooked by something.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.530
Go on.

54:53.920 --> 54:56.161
And that's when
Rod went for him.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.004
Rod grabbed Danny's gun

54:59.040 --> 55:01.168
and the two of them
started wrestling with it.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.607
And me and Victor Charlie
Five Three,

55:04.640 --> 55:06.768
we tried to get it
off them both.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.568
And that's when it went off.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.851
So let's be perfectly clear,
Constable.

55:14.760 --> 55:18.526
You are now declaring
that PC Rod Kennedy

55:18.560 --> 55:20.528
killed Sergeant Daniel Waldron'?

55:20.560 --> 55:22.562
Yes, sir.

55:26.040 --> 55:27.451
Rod killed Danny.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.411
Rod killed Danny.

55:42.320 --> 55:44.846
Oldest trick in the book-
blame the dead bloke.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.882
He killed himself, though.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.729
Fits with him being
the guilty party.

55:48.760 --> 55:51.764
First, three were sticking
together, now there's two.

55:52.480 --> 55:55.723
HASTINGS: I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

55:55.760 --> 55:58.809
Catching criminals is tough
enough but catching coppers...

55:58.840 --> 56:00.842
God give me strength.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.442
We keep going, fellas.

56:04.480 --> 56:06.084
We keep going-

56:07.160 --> 56:08.491
Sir.

56:09.400 --> 56:11.050
Sir.

56:18.400 --> 56:20.209
(Doorbell rings)

56:30.880 --> 56:33.167
(Phone rings)

56:37.120 --> 56:38.406
Hello.

56:38.440 --> 56:41.250
MAN: <i>Bin the previous phone.
Use this one for now.</i>

56:41.280 --> 56:43.567
<i>You'll have a new one
in a couple of days.</i>

56:46.040 --> 56:48.088
I made one mistake. One.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.161
One mistake.
And you keep making me pay.

56:53.200 --> 56:55.009
<i>AC-12 went for it?</i>

56:56.240 --> 56:58.208
- Yeah.
- Oh, don't be modest.

56:58.240 --> 57:00.686
I heard you played them
like violins.

57:05.760 --> 57:07.922
<i>BENTON: I had no prior...</i>

57:07.960 --> 57:10.281
information of the operation...

57:10.320 --> 57:12.288
No prior information...

57:12.320 --> 57:14.402
of the operation
to move Tommy Hunter.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.489
No prior information.
No prior... No prior knowledge.

57:17.520 --> 57:19.249
I had no prior knowledge.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.090
<i>I had no prior knowledge</i>

57:21.120 --> 57:23.327
<i>of the operation to
move Tommy Hunter.</i>

57:27.720 --> 57:29.768
<i>BENTON: Every day
I wish it had been...</i>

57:30.800 --> 57:33.280
somebody else
who'd taken that call.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.690
Somebody else who had to...
