WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:06.832
This restaurant has gotten
really great reviews.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.660
Just keep an open mind.

00:08.747 --> 00:11.141
Aw, last time we ate at a
"keep an open mind" place,

00:11.228 --> 00:12.534
you slipped me fish eggs.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.144
You liked them.

00:14.231 --> 00:16.103
You said they tasted like
little salty Pop Rocks.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.843
Yeah, that was before I knew
they were gonna make

00:17.930 --> 00:19.932
fish babies in my belly.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.891
[engine knocking]

00:21.978 --> 00:23.501
Whoa, it's okay, old girl.

00:23.588 --> 00:24.981
We'll be going downhill soon.

00:25.068 --> 00:28.028
Why couldn't we just
have taken my car?

00:28.115 --> 00:29.594
Because your car's no fun.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.553
With the Galant,
you and the machine are one.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.294
Really feel the road
beneath you.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.730
There's a hole
in the floorboard.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.472
I can see the road beneath me.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.126
I hear you.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.737
She hates it when I get
too liberal with the AC.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.695
Oh, God, the heater?

00:43.782 --> 00:46.568
Well, I got to redirect some
of that hot air off the motor.

00:46.655 --> 00:49.179
I'm-I'm boiling!

00:49.266 --> 00:50.615
Well, just pick up
the floor mat.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.748
It'll kick up a breeze
from the hole.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.664
Why is there duct tape
on the window button?

00:55.751 --> 00:57.448
Because people like you
keep rolling it down,

00:57.535 --> 00:59.102
and unless you got tongs
and a hanger,

00:59.189 --> 01:00.930
it ain't coming back up.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.237
[engine clicking, stops]

01:03.324 --> 01:05.152
Oh, man.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.242
All right, flick the turn
signals right and left.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.982
I'll take a look
under the hood.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.941
Why?Because the hazards don't work.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.377
Safety first.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.249
This is ridiculous.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.251
[horns blaring]

01:17.338 --> 01:19.166
[turn signals clicking]

01:19.253 --> 01:20.776
[hood squeaks]

01:20.863 --> 01:22.778
I don't know if this helps you,

01:22.865 --> 01:25.215
but the speedometer says we're
still going 60 miles an hour.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.567
I think there's a leak
in the radiator hose.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.091
Hand me that piece of tape
off the window switch.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.093
We'll be up and
running in no time.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.967
You took the tape off wrong.

02:06.865 --> 02:07.779
Okay,
how's it going down there?

02:07.866 --> 02:10.869
Well, it's not pretty.

02:10.956 --> 02:13.176
Valves leak, gaskets are shot,

02:13.263 --> 02:15.135
and there's a crack
in the engine block

02:15.222 --> 02:16.788
that's longer than yours.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.878
Okay, okay,
she-she's seen worse.

02:19.965 --> 02:22.229
What's worse
than a cracked engine block?

02:22.316 --> 02:24.274
Are you kidding me?
How about a grease fire

02:24.361 --> 02:25.884
in the middle of a Fourth
of July Parade?

02:25.971 --> 02:27.408
Pulled into a car wash,
put the flames out,

02:27.495 --> 02:29.236
still made the "1812 Overture."

02:29.323 --> 02:31.281
So, what you're saying is

02:31.368 --> 02:33.065
that this is a death trap.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.503
No, what I'm saying is
this car is indestructible.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.114
After the apocalypse, it,
my mother and cockroaches

02:38.201 --> 02:39.681
will be the only
things that survive.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.292
The Galant's gone, Mike.
Let it go.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.251
I'm calling it.
I'd give you the time of death,

02:44.338 --> 02:47.210
but even the clock
on the dash doesn't work.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.081
The Galant can't be dead.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.996
We've been through
too much together.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.433
I mean, I moved myself

02:52.520 --> 02:54.348
out of my mother's house
in this car.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.045
I drove it to take
the police exam.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.090
I took Molly on our first date.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.745
That was a lovely eulogy.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.225
No, you can't take her.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.836
She's too young!

03:04.923 --> 03:07.012
Look at this guy. He's like
one of those Italian widows

03:07.099 --> 03:10.059
throwing herself on the coffin.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.235
Mike, it's time
to get a new car.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.845
I don't want a new car,
and even if I did,

03:13.932 --> 03:14.890
I can't afford one.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.761
So I'll float you a loan.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.154
No, I'm not
comfortable with that.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.808
Come on, man,
I can't stand the thought

03:19.895 --> 03:21.810
of a friend of mine riding
around on a dirty city bus.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.377
I ride the bus.

03:23.464 --> 03:24.595
And it suits you.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.118
Besides,

03:26.206 --> 03:27.990
he's good for the loan.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.731
You're more of a "teach a man
to fish" kind of friend.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.125
That's a very
generous offer, Carl,

03:33.213 --> 03:34.475
but since I'm 20 years old,

03:34.562 --> 03:35.954
I've always stood
on my own two feet.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.217
Never bought anything
I couldn't afford.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.609
What are you
talking about?

03:38.696 --> 03:40.655
You and your wife
are 80 grand in the hole.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.004
I married into that debt.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.615
Love knows no credit score!

03:44.702 --> 03:47.009
All right, well, the
offer's on the table

03:47.096 --> 03:48.619
if you change your mind.Thanks.

03:48.706 --> 03:49.968
You're a good friend,
and I'm gonna keep it that way

03:50.055 --> 03:51.492
by not taking your money.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.407
I'm willing to risk
our friendship.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.843
[chuckles]
I'm not.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.587
Mooch.

03:59.674 --> 04:02.633
How's it looking
out there?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.287
Not good. Poor guy.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.506
He loved that car.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.029
You know you're smiling, right?

04:07.116 --> 04:08.770
I can't help it;
I hate that piece of crap.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.251
[door closes]

04:11.338 --> 04:13.209
Is there any hope?

04:13.296 --> 04:15.777
None. It's gonna cost two times
what it's worth to fix it.

04:15.864 --> 04:16.821
Oh.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.346
I'm so sorry.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.348
I know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.001
I feel like I lost a part of me.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.699
Well, we'll figure it
out like we always do.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.178
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.485
You're sitting pretty
on an '02 Camry.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.748
Which you can use
any time I'm not.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.795
Yeah, and you can
borrow my car, too.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.710
[chuckles]
See?
Flynn girls to the rescue.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.059
Great. Can I use
your car tomorrow?

04:37.146 --> 04:39.148
Absolutely.
Oh, you know what, no.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.584
I forgot I have
a hair appointment.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.107
Well, then he'll just
take mine.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.239
Thank you.
Hold on.
Did you say tomorrow

04:43.326 --> 04:44.893
or next Friday?
Tomorrow.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.808
Tomorrow's not good.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.332
Actually, next
Friday's bad, too.

04:49.419 --> 04:50.812
I can drop you
off somewhere.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.118
If it's before 9:00 a.m.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.642
Yeah, and I can pick
you up after 7:00,

04:54.729 --> 04:56.513
unless you want to take
the bus to my work,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.472
and then we can
leave at 6:30.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.737
If I was gonna ride the bus,
would I just come home?

05:02.824 --> 05:05.261
Boy, you know what,
for someone who needs a ride,

05:05.348 --> 05:06.915
you're awful snippy.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.831
Yeah.

05:15.924 --> 05:16.838
[music playing on TV]Look at this guy.

05:16.925 --> 05:19.493
Gets paid to live in Hawaii

05:19.580 --> 05:22.147
and do jumping jacks on the
beach with two hot broads.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.280
If I was him, the only
thing I'd do different

05:24.367 --> 05:26.326
is turn around.

05:29.807 --> 05:33.115
I am going stir crazy
without a car.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.246
Well, you could go for a walk.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.204
If you can't help,

05:35.291 --> 05:36.858
don't say anything.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.773
Where do you
suddenly need to go?

05:38.860 --> 05:41.732
Every Saturday you just sit here
like a lump.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.995
That's because I chose
to sit here like a lump.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.475
Now I'm forced to.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.782
Trapped here
like a caged panther!

05:47.869 --> 05:50.741
Really? That's the animal
that best describes you?

05:53.091 --> 05:54.963
The point is I need
my freedom.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.791
Well, why didn't
you say something?

05:56.878 --> 05:58.140
You can borrow my car.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.402
Seriously?Of course.

05:59.489 --> 06:00.751
It's in the driveway.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.926
Oh, thanks, Vince.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.667
Just take off the cover,

06:03.754 --> 06:05.452
dust it with the car brush
and you're good to go.

06:05.539 --> 06:06.757
No problem.Oh, and when you
put gas in it,

06:06.844 --> 06:08.890
make sure you use premium.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.370
It knocks if you don't.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.197
The driving log is
in the glove box.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.590
Driving log?

06:13.677 --> 06:15.070
Yeah, it's where I jot down

06:15.157 --> 06:16.898
the miles driven,
the gallons put in,

06:16.985 --> 06:18.334
the amount paid,
that kind of stuff.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.728
I also like to know
which station

06:20.815 --> 06:22.338
and which pump.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.993
It's the vehicle's
autobiography,

06:25.080 --> 06:27.996
if you will.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.781
Look, I-I'm just running
to the batting cages.

06:30.868 --> 06:33.131
If it's the one on Logan,
don't park in that parking lot.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.785
Those are compact spaces

06:34.872 --> 06:37.397
with kids flinging doors open
like animals.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.747
No good.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.097
I'll park on the street.

06:42.184 --> 06:45.405
You will never, ever park
that car on the street.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.798
What you're gonna do
is park two blocks down

06:47.885 --> 06:49.757
at the drugstore,
get an end space,

06:49.844 --> 06:52.063
turn on the alarm,
put on the cover,

06:52.150 --> 06:53.717
and enjoy the batting cages.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.589
Careful crossing
that street on foot.

06:55.676 --> 06:56.807
If you see a bunch
of candle and flowers,

06:56.894 --> 06:58.983
that's the bad spot.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.163
I'll just stay here.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.426
You sure?

07:06.513 --> 07:08.079
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.125
Well, any time. I'm easy.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.872
Thanks for picking me up, Carl.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.439
I just had to get
out of that house.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.702
Of course. It's not
right for a man like you

07:21.789 --> 07:23.573
to be stuck at home with
no means of transportation.

07:23.660 --> 07:24.966
It's definitely inconvenient.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.098
It's emasculating is what it is.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.143
Reduced to begging friends

07:28.230 --> 07:31.015
for rides, hat in hand.

07:31.102 --> 07:31.973
Thumb in butt.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.715
All right.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.020
It's getting chilly in here.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.239
You mind rolling
up that window?

07:40.982 --> 07:42.940
Really?

07:43.027 --> 07:45.421
Oh, would you look at that?

07:45.508 --> 07:47.815
A personalized check
made out to Michael Biggs.

07:47.902 --> 07:51.340
[chuckles] Well,
finders keepers, I guess.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.950
I'm not taking your money, Carl.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.822
Why not? You need a car, right?

07:54.909 --> 07:56.650
No, because I got friends
like you giving me a ride

07:56.737 --> 07:58.956
and a very generous family
that lets me borrow the car

07:59.043 --> 08:01.002
any time I want
every other Thursday.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.874
So you saying
me giving you a ride

08:03.961 --> 08:05.441
is keeping you
from taking my money?

08:05.528 --> 08:07.095
Well, in a way, yes.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.142
Get out.
What are you doing?

08:11.229 --> 08:12.709
I'm putting a stop
to this nonsense.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.233
Either you take my
check or eat my dust!

08:15.320 --> 08:17.061
You're not gonna make me walk?

08:17.148 --> 08:19.150
You can do whatever you want
once you get out of my car.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.936
This is ridiculous!

08:22.023 --> 08:23.198
And so is your refusal
to take my loan!

08:23.285 --> 08:26.462
Well, it's not
gonna happen, okay?

08:26.549 --> 08:27.594
You better take my money,

08:27.681 --> 08:29.030
you selfish son of a bitch!

08:29.117 --> 08:31.119
Let me love you!

08:35.950 --> 08:37.908
This is crazy.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.997
You need a car,
and I got one I hardly use.

08:40.084 --> 08:43.000
I am a grown man!

08:43.087 --> 08:45.568
I'm too old to be
asking my mommy

08:45.655 --> 08:47.222
if I can borrow her car.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.484
Besides, how are you supposed
to get around?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.051
Where do I go?

08:50.138 --> 08:51.443
I cut my own hair,
I scrape my own corns,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.271
I got a freezer full
of hot dogs.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.578
I'm set for the year.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.015
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.843
You're gonna kill yourself
on that thing.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.497
I'll be fine.
Before the Galant,

09:01.584 --> 09:02.933
this thing got me
all over town.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.239
It just needed some
grease on the chain,

09:04.326 --> 09:05.414
a little air in the tires,

09:05.501 --> 09:08.548
and we are good to go!

09:08.635 --> 09:10.506
How you gonna get
this casserole home?

09:10.593 --> 09:13.161
I delivered papers on
this bike for eight years.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.380
I can carry a pan of leftovers.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.035
Mike Biggs is back
in a banana seat!

Okay, watch your step.
No peeking.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.536
Ooh! I don't understand.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.930
I thought we couldn't afford
a new car.

09:43.017 --> 09:43.974
Don't worry; I
got a good deal.

It's ours.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.640
What have you done?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.518
Molly, we needed a car.
I got us a car.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.998
That is not "a car."

10:08.085 --> 10:10.740
That's your mother's car,
the guilt mobile.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.525
What's that supposed to mean?

10:13.613 --> 10:14.526
Do you really think
that she just gave you that car

10:14.614 --> 10:17.268
with no strings attached?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.400
Well, so I'll have
to give her a ride

10:18.487 --> 10:19.967
every once in a while.

10:20.054 --> 10:20.794
And when is that?
Once a week? Once a month?

10:20.881 --> 10:22.839
Four times a day?

10:22.926 --> 10:24.667
Did you get
any of that in writing?!

10:24.754 --> 10:27.452
You're being ridiculous!Am I?

10:27.539 --> 10:29.063
'Cause when we first
started dating,

10:29.150 --> 10:30.978
we had to go see your mother
three times a week.

How could you want to
throw all that away?

10:38.463 --> 10:41.205
Because I hate walking,
I crashed my bike

10:41.292 --> 10:43.338
and I really needed a car!

10:43.425 --> 10:44.426

they can't, right?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.355

feels like

11:00.442 --> 11:02.792
more of an homage to safety.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.402
You get a seat belt?

11:04.489 --> 11:07.405
All I've got back here
are ashtrays.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.844
No, it's buried in the seat,
just keep digging.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.846
So, you won't take
a loan from me,

11:12.933 --> 11:14.021
but you'll take a 40-year-old
car from your mother?Yes.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.110
Because this car is not a gift.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.068
Being raised by that woman,
I earned it.

11:18.155 --> 11:21.376

11:21.463 --> 11:23.160
Oh, but the war ain't over.

Your mother's not giving you
this out of the goodness

11:24.466 --> 11:25.989
of her heart,
and you know why?

11:26.076 --> 11:27.991

and she has no goodness?

a ketchup packet
