THE ARMY DOES WELL.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.281
THAT'S KEEP A PAPER TRAIL.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.065
UH-UH.

12:12.099 --> 12:16.736
- THIS IS YOU AND ME TALKING.
- THANKS.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.572
SO YOU LEFT PANAMA,
BUT MY DAD STAYED?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.641
STAYED TO CONTINUE
TRAINING LOCAL FORCES.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.111
THEN HOW IS IT THAT YOU
WERE WITH HIM WHEN HE DIED?

12:24.144 --> 12:27.314
I WENT BACK A YEAR LATER.
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

12:27.347 --> 12:31.785
THE U.S. PULLED OUT
ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL
FROM PANAMA BACK IN '99.

12:31.819 --> 12:35.823
A YEAR LATER'S 2000.
I MEAN, HOW COULD--

12:37.991 --> 12:41.061
THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO SAY
GARY DIED IN ITALY.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.463
BECAUSE YOU
WENT BACK UNDERCOVER.

12:43.496 --> 12:47.467
BECAUSE YOUR FATHER,
MY FRIEND, WAS MISSING.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.603
SOTO'S BEEN M.I.A.
FOR THREE MONTHS.
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

12:50.637 --> 12:54.341
IN AUGUST, A COLOMBIAN VILLAGE
WAS WIPED OUT BY
A NEW GUERRILLA FACTION.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.477
SOTO WAS ALREADY IN THE AREA
WITH A PARAMILITARY CADRE.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.247
THEY WERE DEPLOYED TO FIND
AND TERMINATE THE GROUP.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.182
NO ONE BETTER FOR THE JOB
THAN GARY.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.584
TRUE.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.420
EXCEPT ON DAY FOUR
THEY WERE AMBUSHED.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.656
MOST OF THE CADRE WAS KILLED,
INCLUDING SOTO.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.825
OR SO WE THOUGHT.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.333
A SURVIVOR JUST TURNED UP
IN LA BAMA.

13:20.367 --> 13:25.038
HE SAID THAT SOTO
WAS WOUNDED AND ALIVE,
MOST LIKELY CAPTURED.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.674
THAT'D BE HELLACIOUS GOOD NEWS
IF IT'S TRUE.

13:27.707 --> 13:31.278
THE GUERRILLA LEADER RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FARC REBELS.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.513
HE'S KNOWN AS "ARAÑA,"

13:33.546 --> 13:36.149
A SPIDER, BECAUSE HE'S
CALCULATING AND RUTHLESS.

13:36.183 --> 13:40.220
BEHEADING VILLAGERS
IS A NEW M.O. FOR FARC.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.689
NEW PLAYER IN THE GAME
BRINGING NEW TACTICS.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.558
HAS THERE BEEN A RANSOM DEMAND?
IS THERE ANY PROOF
THEY HAVE SOTO?

13:45.592 --> 13:49.529
NO, BUT THE PEASANTS
HAVE REPORTED SEEING AN
AMERICAN AMONG THE GUERRILLAS.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.165
WE NEED CONTACT WITH ARAÑA.
SEE IF HE'LL NEGOTIATE.

13:52.199 --> 13:56.536
[ Phone Ringing ]
EXCUSE ME.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.206
BLUE IGUANA HERE.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.708
HE'S FINE, YOU KNOW?

14:01.741 --> 14:05.678
SOTO'S PROBABLY
DRIVING THEM CRAZY,
ALWAYS SINGING OFF-KEY.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.648
HELL, THEY OUGHTA PAY US
TO TAKE HIM BACK.
[ Both Chuckle ]

14:08.681 --> 14:10.417
- WHAT'S THAT?
- IF WE CAN'T NEGOTIATE
HIS RELEASE,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.685
IF WE HAVE TO EXTRACT HIM,
THE MOST FAMILIAR FACE...

14:12.719 --> 14:14.721
WOULD BE THE LEAST CONFUSING
FOR HIM.

14:14.754 --> 14:18.325
THAT'S ME.
AS TEAM LEADER,
I'D SAY YOU'RE FIRST IN.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.994
AS YOUR FRIEND,
I'M NOT SO SURE.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.396
I'LL LET YOU DECIDE.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.934
YOU AFRAID
MY JUDGMENT'S COMPROMISED
BECAUSE GARY'S A FRIEND?

14:26.967 --> 14:29.636
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, BOSS.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.240
YAVIZA CITY OFFICIAL
MAY HAVE ACCESS TO ARAÑA.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.843
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.
NO OTHER STRAP HANGER
I'D RATHER HAVE WITH US.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.512
WE'LL FIND THE SPIDER'S WEB.
DO IT.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.850
BECAUSE ONCE WE RESCUE SOTO,
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TERMINATE THIS ARAÑA.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.353
WHY DIDN'T ANYONE
TELL US HE WAS MISSING?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.788
MEMBERS OF THE UNIT
ARE ALWAYS MISSING.

14:48.821 --> 14:52.525
- NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS.
- YOU'RE A LIAR, SERGEANT MAJOR.

14:52.559 --> 14:57.097
MY DAD WROTE THIS LETTER
IN SEPTEMBER OF THAT YEAR.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.299
A MONTH AFTER YOU SAY
HE WENT MISSING.

14:59.332 --> 15:03.036
SO YOU WANT TO TRY AGAIN?
OR DO I GO BACK TO MY HOTEL,

15:03.070 --> 15:05.472
FINISH WRITING THAT STORY?

15:11.511 --> 15:15.048
STOP. WAIT.
THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPLANATION.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.151
HOW MY FATHER WROTE A CHATTY
LETTER TO HIS FAMILY...

15:18.185 --> 15:21.588
WHILE HE WAS BEING HELD CAPTIVE
BY SOME BLOODTHIRSTY GUERRILLAS?

15:21.621 --> 15:25.625
IS THIS SPIDER THING A FIGMENT
OF YOUR IMAGINATION TOO?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.827
THIS IS A WASTE OF MY TIME.
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF LIARS.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.998
- HOLD ON.
- YOU CAN READ MY STORY
WHEN IT'S PUBLISHED.

15:31.031 --> 15:34.434
WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME SEE THE LETTER.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.504
COME ON.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.945
YEAH. I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE
AN EXPLANATION.

15:45.979 --> 15:50.850
OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.,
THE DATE IS WRITTEN
IN THE INTERNATIONAL WAY.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.286
FIRST THE DATE, THEN THE MONTH.

15:53.320 --> 15:57.257
THIS WAS WRITTEN JULY 9,
NOT SEPTEMBER 7.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.293
NOW, IF YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE REST OF MY STORY,
SIT DOWN.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.732
AND DON'T EVER ACCUSE ME
OF LYING AGAIN.

16:11.171 --> 16:14.541

* A REPOSSESSED CAR
AND A TEARSTAINED FACE *

16:14.574 --> 16:17.677

* OH, WHAT IN THE WORLD
CAN THE MATTER BE *

16:20.880 --> 16:24.817
* AND WHY, DEAR LORD
HAVE YOU CHALLENGED ME *

16:24.851 --> 16:28.355
* ANOTHER WOMAN PRAYS TO THEE

16:28.388 --> 16:32.859
* WHO GAVE HER MAN
TO THE ARMY *

16:32.892 --> 16:34.827

[ Cheering ]

16:45.004 --> 16:47.707
- DRINK IT.
- NO. ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.810
NOT TODAY.
THESE WOMEN WANT US HERE.
WE STAY HERE, NEWBIE.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.545
NO. RUSSIAN CODES ARE WAITING.
HOW LONG DOES THIS GO?

16:52.579 --> 16:55.115
LIKE MOST THINGS--
TILL IT'S OVER.

17:00.087 --> 17:03.723
HAVE A SEAT.
I'D LOVE TO. UNFORTUNATELY,
I'VE GOT TO DUCK OUT.

17:03.756 --> 17:08.195
YOU KNOW A WIDOW'S ONLY
PROTOCOL-- WHAT A WIDOW WANTS,
A WIDOW GETS?

17:08.228 --> 17:12.232
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
ALL AFTERNOON. I'D LIKE
TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.701
I'M MARRIED.
AND SO WAS I...

17:14.734 --> 17:17.437
UNTIL MY HUSBAND WAS KILLED
DEFENDING THIS COUNTRY.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.507
YOU EVER HEAR
OF THE G.I. BILL?
YES, OF COURSE I HAVE.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.543
WELL, I'M PRESENTING IT.
YOU'RE GONNA PAY IT.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.881
ASK YOUR BUDDIES.
[ Bob ] I WALK HER BACK
TO HER GUESTHOUSE.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.851
SHE HAS ME CHECK FOR INTRUDERS.
AND THEN SHE--

17:31.884 --> 17:34.554
WELL, I BELIEVE THE POLITE TERM
IS "PROPOSITIONED ME."

17:36.923 --> 17:39.192
- WHAT'D YOU DO?
- I PULLED PITCH.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.594
- WHAT?
- I GOT OUT OF DODGE.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.931
- YOU TURNED DOWN A WIDOW?
- I'M MARRIED.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.300
NOT ON THE DAY OF THE DEAD.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.303
OH, IT'S THE DAY OF THE DEAD,
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO
SLEEP WITH HER?

17:53.573 --> 17:56.476
OH, WHAT, DOES MY QUESTION
VIOLATE PROTOCOL HERE?

17:56.509 --> 18:00.813
IT VIOLATES PROTOCOL TO IGNORE
A REQUEST FROM A WIDOW
ON DAY OF THE DEAD.

18:00.847 --> 18:05.418
- YOU GOTTA GET
BACK IN THERE, MAN.
- YOU'RE KIDDING!

18:05.452 --> 18:07.420
YOU EITHER GIVE HER
WHAT SHE WANTS...

18:07.454 --> 18:10.823
OR YOU CHANGE HER MIND
ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.326
MESSAGE ENDS.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.733
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT
I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE OFFER.

HAS ITS TRADITIONS.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.520

IT'S THE SECOND TO
LAST THING YOU'D WANNA DO.

- SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
- WE FOUND IT IN A STORE
IN YAVIZA, PANAMA.
