It's the A-bomb!
Duck and cover!

00:14.700 --> 00:16.700
I bet Eric's trying to sneak out.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.700
Red, Red. Wait. Wait.
What if it's a burglar?

00:19.780 --> 00:21.780
What's a burglar
gonna steal from us?

00:23.300 --> 00:25.500
My Shirley Temple figurines.

00:27.220 --> 00:30.460
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have told
Liz Anderson about them.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.220
- Her nephew's been in jail, you know.
- [Schotzie Whimpers]

00:33.300 --> 00:35.180
Oh! Look at this.

00:35.260 --> 00:38.020
Some guard dog. You know,
we could be trampled by Mongolians.

00:38.060 --> 00:41.020
This thing wouldn't
even wag its tail.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.540
Hey. I-I-I heard a scary noise.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.940
Good God. Are you nude?

00:52.260 --> 00:54.140
No.

00:54.180 --> 00:57.460
- I'm wearing my toga.
<i>- [Clatter/ng]</i>

00:57.540 --> 01:00.900
- [Gasps] There it is again.
- That's it. I'm gettin' my bat.

01:00.980 --> 01:04.260
All right. Calm down. It's probably
just Steven trying to sneak out.

01:04.340 --> 01:08.900
What if it's not Steven?
What if the burglar has Steven?

01:08.980 --> 01:11.940
Well, then we'll try to talk him
into taking Eric too.

01:14.180 --> 01:17.020
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Look at him.

01:18.180 --> 01:20.380
Bare-assed and holding
a plastic bat.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.860
That's your son, Kitty.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.940
What kind of burglar
robs people on a weeknight?

01:32.020 --> 01:34.980
Doesn't he have a job
to go to in the morning?

01:40.260 --> 01:42.660
- [Kitty] Jackie?
<i>- [Red] What the hell?</i>

01:42.740 --> 01:45.900

02:26.740 --> 02:29.620
Who the hell do you think you are...

02:29.660 --> 02:32.500
bringing a girl into my house
in the middle of the night?

02:32.540 --> 02:36.340
And right in our basement. We keep
our Christmas decorations down there.

02:37.820 --> 02:41.580
BabyJesus was watching.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.020
- I told you to look where you were going.
- What idiot...

02:47.100 --> 02:49.500
leaves a LEGO set
right in front of the door?

02:49.580 --> 02:54.100
You knocked over
my space command center?

02:54.180 --> 02:56.380
I spent three hours building that.

02:56.460 --> 02:59.700
All right. Now what
is going on in my basement?

02:59.740 --> 03:02.500
Jackie's been sleeping here
the last couple of weeks.

03:02.580 --> 03:07.220
Couple of weeks? This is not
the Playboy Mansion, you know.

03:07.260 --> 03:11.820
- Look, nothing was going on.
- Nothing was going on?

03:11.900 --> 03:15.300
Um, space command centers
were ruined!

03:15.380 --> 03:19.300
Would you please
go put some pants on?

03:19.380 --> 03:21.820
This is where I eat.

03:25.780 --> 03:28.220
Jackie's only been staying here
'cause her dad's in jail...

03:28.300 --> 03:31.500
- and her mom's still not back yet.
- Steven! That's private.

03:31.580 --> 03:34.060
Your mom's not back yet?
You told me she came home.

03:34.140 --> 03:38.220
Could we not talk about this?
I'm fine. Okay? Everything is fine.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.140
- If you need a place-
- No, no, no. I don't need anything.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.580
I'm only here 'cause...

03:43.620 --> 03:46.540
I am such a tramp.

03:46.620 --> 03:50.780
So, I should just go home
and try to control my dirty urges.

03:50.820 --> 03:54.580
Jackie, you're not going home.
There's nobody there.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.420
All right. Look, Jackie.
Tonight you can sleep in Laurie's room...

03:58.500 --> 04:03.060
and then tomorrow, we'll
track down your floozy mother.

04:03.140 --> 04:06.460
Honey, do you have any idea
where she might be?

04:06.500 --> 04:12.140
Well, the last postcard I got had a picture
of some guy with a bone through his nose.

04:12.220 --> 04:14.660
What is that, like, Tennessee?

04:17.740 --> 04:20.220
Hey, Donna.
This just in:

04:20.300 --> 04:23.660
Your weirdo boyfriend
sleeps in the nude.

04:23.740 --> 04:25.860
Yeah? So? I do too.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.500
Oh, yeah!

04:31.980 --> 04:34.580
Oh, I can see it now.

04:34.660 --> 04:37.060
And it is glorious.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.180
Excuse me.

04:43.340 --> 04:45.460
Jackie, I can't believe
your parents are gone.

04:45.540 --> 04:50.700
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay, everybody needs to stop worrying about me.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.500
I'm fine.
I mean, how could I not be?

04:53.580 --> 04:58.900
Mrs. Forman did my hair
and made me smiley-faced pancakes.

04:58.940 --> 05:03.780
Eric, this house is like a shabby hotel
with really great service.

05:03.860 --> 05:07.700
Oh, hey, while you're visiting,
here's my LEGO set and a picture...

05:07.780 --> 05:11.020
of the space command center.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.540
Okay? Get building.

05:13.620 --> 05:16.660
I swear to God, if my three-man escape pod
doesn't fit the star bay...

05:16.740 --> 05:18.820
heads are gonna roll.

05:19.780 --> 05:22.620
I have a question.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.980
If Hyde was in Hyde's bed...

05:25.020 --> 05:27.540
and Jackie was in Hyde's bed...

05:27.580 --> 05:30.660
what exactly was going on
in said bed?

05:30.740 --> 05:33.260
Nothing. She needed
a place to sleep.

05:33.340 --> 05:36.020
"Needed a place to sleep."

05:36.100 --> 05:40.180
Well, a bed is an interesting choice,
now, wouldn't you say?

05:40.220 --> 05:44.180
Oh, shut up, Michael.
It's not like we were doing it.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.380
Oh, come on, Jackie.

05:47.420 --> 05:51.420
You can't sleep in the same bed
with someone and not be doing it.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.260
I've fallen asleep not doin' it
and woken up doin' it.

05:56.340 --> 05:59.300
And that's why they won't
put him to sleep at the dentist.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.060
Guys, I don't know what's
going on with Nina.

06:08.140 --> 06:11.340
I keep asking to meet her parents,
but she keeps making excuses.

06:11.420 --> 06:15.100
It's probably the same reason
I won't let you meet my parents.

06:15.140 --> 06:18.740
She's afraid you're gonna say
something weird and embarrass her.

06:18.780 --> 06:23.900
Oh, please. I'm a hot-looking,
smooth-talking, frisky-assed son-of-a-bitch.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.620
Hey, Fez. Right there.

06:30.700 --> 06:34.540
That's, like-
That's, like, a really weird thing to say.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.020
Yeah, I mean, we're used to you,
but, dude, you're weird.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.380
For Nina to let you
meet her parents-

06:43.460 --> 06:46.260
I think what Kelso's
trying to say is that...

06:46.300 --> 06:48.740
maybe you don't make
the best first impression.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.740
Like, remember the first
time you met my parents?

06:50.780 --> 06:54.860
- Mom, Dad, this is Fez.
- Well, hello there.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.980
He did what?

07:05.780 --> 07:09.540
Yeah, and then it actually got
even more disturbing.

07:10.820 --> 07:14.020
Get this creepy bastard off me!

07:17.780 --> 07:20.820
I never heard that story.

07:20.860 --> 07:23.260
So how was Forman's mom?

07:26.860 --> 07:29.620
Well, at first she was giving me nothing,
but by the end...

07:29.660 --> 07:32.180
she was giving me something.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.940
Yeah! She's spunky!

07:37.980 --> 07:40.220
- Man, I'd kiss your mom.
- Oh, my God.

07:40.300 --> 07:43.380
How could Jackie's mother
abandon her only child?

07:43.420 --> 07:45.340
I have half a mind
to take this public.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.460
[Gasps]
We could go on <i>Donahue.</i>

07:48.540 --> 07:51.260
No. Go on <i>Carson.</i> He's funnier.

07:52.620 --> 07:54.900
One time, the animal guy was on...

07:54.940 --> 07:57.260
his parrot dooked
right on Johnny's head.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.740
Dad, I think you're
missing the point.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.860
We need to find Jackie
someplace to stay, you know...

08:02.940 --> 08:04.820
where she won't be all alone.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.100
I can get her a room
at the hotel I work at.

08:07.180 --> 08:10.460
No, Jackie is not staying in a hotel.
We have an empty room right here.

08:10.540 --> 08:15.580
Kitty, every time we have an empty room,
you wanna fill it up with a stray child.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.980
You're like the old lady
who lived in a shoe.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.140
Did you just call me "old"?

08:26.460 --> 08:28.460
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>Here's what I th/nk.</i>

08:28.540 --> 08:32.419
Oh, hey, everybody!
Mr. Nude has an opinion.

08:35.460 --> 08:39.740
I'm sure we're all interested
in what Mr. Nude has to say.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.940
Floor's all yours...

08:43.020 --> 08:44.860
Mr. Nude.

08:44.940 --> 08:48.540
- Never mind.
- I guess he was just thinkin'...

08:48.620 --> 08:50.660
about bein' nude.

08:50.740 --> 08:52.660
What is wrong with you people?

08:52.700 --> 08:56.180
There is nothing funny about a teenaged girl
whose mother abandoned her.

08:56.220 --> 08:59.140
You know, we're aIIJackie's got.
We can't just turn our backs on her.

09:00.780 --> 09:04.780
Donna, you're right.
You teIIJackie she can stay with us.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.540
What? No. No, she can't
stay with us.

09:07.580 --> 09:11.060
- Sure. She can stay in your room with you.
- But-

09:14.260 --> 09:16.740
Oh, you're all gonna pay for this!

09:23.580 --> 09:27.020
I can't believe my dad's making me ask
Jackie to move in with us.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.180
This is gonna be a nightmare.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.620
"Donna, where's your spirit?"

09:31.700 --> 09:33.860
"Donna, you're still hungry?"

09:33.940 --> 09:37.100
"Donna, your lumberjack head
is blocking out the sun." [Whining Scoff]

09:38.300 --> 09:41.940
You know, I'm not too big.
She is too small.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.540
Okay, just for the record...

09:44.620 --> 09:47.860
I don't sleep nude
for any disgusting reason.

09:47.940 --> 09:50.020
I'm just a hot sleeper.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.940
Okay, I'm not a hot sleeper.

09:53.980 --> 09:57.060
I'm 17 years old.
I sleep right next door to the girl I love.

09:57.140 --> 09:59.140
Things occur to me. Okay?

09:59.220 --> 10:02.900
If I'm already nude, you know-
It just saves time.

10:02.940 --> 10:06.300
Guys, Nina agreed
to let me meet her parents.

10:06.380 --> 10:08.220
And to seem completely normal...

10:08.300 --> 10:10.860
I've come up with the perfect opening line
for Nina's mother.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.260
[Clears Throat]
"Hello, Mrs. Bartel.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.900
I can see where Nina
gets her lovely ass."

10:17.860 --> 10:20.940
You're so weird, man.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.220
You know what?
There's a way around that.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.420
I'm gonna make you so beautiful...

10:25.500 --> 10:28.300
that Nina's parents don't notice
how freakin' weird you are.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.340
Bein' beautiful-That's how
I get away with stuff.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.300
Except my problem is
I gotta tone it down...

10:33.380 --> 10:35.340
'cause otherwise the chick's
mom gets interested.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.820
Then we got a big problem.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.180
Let's make you man-pretty.

11:25.460 --> 11:27.540
[No Audible Dialogue]

11:51.620 --> 11:54.100
Okay. I've been thinking
about what to do with Jackie.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.660
I think we're overlooking
the mobile home option.

11:57.740 --> 12:00.460
Okay? You could park her
right in the driveway...

12:00.540 --> 12:04.340
and we'll all know she's safe
in her own little, steel box.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.860
Donna, you have to let her
stay with you.

12:06.940 --> 12:08.820
Come on.
She's your best friend.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
She's not my best friend.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.020
Well, then, who's your best friend?

12:16.060 --> 12:19.220
Oh, crap! How the hell
did that happen?

12:19.300 --> 12:23.380
Oh, look. Mr. Nude is helping.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.420
Mr. Nude, huh?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.780
That was my nickname in college.

12:27.860 --> 12:30.220
Dad, you didn't go to college.

12:30.300 --> 12:33.260
Didn't stop me
from gettin' a nickname.

12:33.340 --> 12:37.740
You all gonna be here for this?
I don't thinkJackie's gonna be cool with that.

12:37.820 --> 12:40.140
Well, Steven,
everybody needs support.

12:40.220 --> 12:44.460
Like this one time,
I left the supermarket in a really bad mood...

12:44.540 --> 12:48.300
and then I met these very nice people,
the Hare Krishnas.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.460
They sang me a song.
They gave me some rice.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.540
It was just the little pickup
I needed.

12:53.620 --> 12:57.020
You know, if I hadn't had to make dinner,
I might've gotten into their van.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.500
[Laughing]

13:01.780 --> 13:04.620
Yeah, those freaks
were hasslin' me once too.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.780
So when they weren't lookin',
I stole five boxes ofThin Mints.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.660
Kelso, those were Girl Scouts.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.700
Whatever, man.
They were pushy.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.780
Here comes Jackie.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.700
Well, I think this is a big mistake.

13:24.780 --> 13:27.380
When this blows up in your face,
don't come lookin' for me.

13:27.460 --> 13:30.780
I'll be bustin' up Forman's
space station again.

13:34.140 --> 13:38.140
Jackie! Jackie, Donna has something
she wants to ask you.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.140
- Donna.
- [Clears Throat]

13:40.220 --> 13:42.740
So, Jackie, we were all thinking...

13:42.780 --> 13:44.660
that you might come
stay with me for awhile...

13:44.700 --> 13:47.060
since you're having
such a hard time right now.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.780
God! I'm so sick of this!

13:49.860 --> 13:51.700
I don't have hard times!

13:51.780 --> 13:54.700
I'm Jackie Burkhart.
I got voted head cheerleader...

13:54.780 --> 13:58.540
by the largest margin
in cheerleader history.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.020
I have a wonderful life.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.940
- Yeah, but, Jackie, your dad's in prison,
and your mom-
- I'm sorry, Donna...

14:04.020 --> 14:06.940
but you're just not popular
enough for me to live with.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.980
[Scoffs]
I'm not popular enough?

14:11.060 --> 14:13.380
I was doing you a favor,
'cause I felt bad for you.

14:13.460 --> 14:16.300
Well, don't. Okay? I don't need to be
your good deed for the day.

14:16.380 --> 14:21.660
Fine. There's the door. Don't let it hit
your popular, little butt on the way out.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.660
F-Fine.

14:27.340 --> 14:30.900
Well, that was pretty hot.

14:36.140 --> 14:39.580
And that is how you make a canoe
out of banana skins.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.580
Oh!

14:42.860 --> 14:45.300
They love me. See?
There's nothing to worry about.

14:45.380 --> 14:49.180
- Great. Then we should get going.
- Oh! Oh! Don't go.

14:49.260 --> 14:52.780
Oh, it's such a pleasure having
someone so exotic in our home.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.820
We're so happy that Nina
has made a friend of you, Fez.

14:56.860 --> 15:02.100
Well, maybe it's because I'm so handsome
and not at all creepy.

15:02.180 --> 15:04.700
And, by the way, I see where
Nina gets her lovely ass.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.700
[All Laughing]

15:09.860 --> 15:11.780
Hey, I was talking to you,
Mr. Bartel.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.540
Oh, my!

15:16.860 --> 15:18.940
Honey, you are really broadening
your horizons.

15:19.020 --> 15:22.140
Having a friend like this is gonna look great
on your college application.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.500
Yes. We always enjoy
meeting Nina's friends.

15:24.580 --> 15:27.500
You keep calling me her "friend."
Don't you mean, her "boyfriend"?

15:27.580 --> 15:30.940
[Stammering]
Boyfriend?

15:32.700 --> 15:35.540
[Laughing]

15:35.580 --> 15:39.340
- What's so funny?
- You can't be her boyfriend.

15:39.420 --> 15:42.100
- Why not?
- Because you're-What's the word, honey?

15:42.140 --> 15:45.140
- "Different"?
- Okay. Different.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.580
Oh, I see.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.980
- You mean, "not white."
- Fez, no.

15:52.060 --> 15:53.900
I think I'll be leaving now.
Good day.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.500
- Fez, wait.
- I said, "Good day."

15:58.780 --> 16:00.940
By the way, I hope you do not
have a good day.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.580
And then when I asked her to live with me,
she said I'm not freakin' popular.

16:07.660 --> 16:10.740
Am I not on the radio
all the time as "Hot Donna"?

16:10.780 --> 16:15.780
Okay? There are "Hot Donna" posters
all over town, objectifying me.

16:15.860 --> 16:18.500
Is Jackie being objectified?
No!

16:20.260 --> 16:23.780
She only said that 'cause you embarrassed
her in a roomful of people.

16:23.860 --> 16:27.460
It was like a damn telethon in there.
The only thing missing was Jerry Lewis.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.580
So, what, it's my fault,
'cause I didn't ask her right?

16:31.900 --> 16:34.900
Okay. How about when your mom left?

16:34.980 --> 16:37.700
Think how you would've felt
if you walked into a roomful of people...

16:37.780 --> 16:41.300
everyone's talking about how sad
your life is and how much they pity you.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.660
- Yeah. I guess I get that.
- I'm just sayin' that...

16:43.740 --> 16:46.260
Jackie needs a place to stay,
and it'd be really cool...

16:46.300 --> 16:49.460
if you can ask her in a way
that doesn't make her feel bad.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.180
[Groans]
Fine.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.620
But she didn't have to
call me "unpopular." Okay?

16:54.700 --> 16:59.460
Unpopular girls don't get free Slurpees
from Tommy at the 7-Eleven.

16:59.540 --> 17:05.260
Donna, two years ago, Tommy tried to jump
a school bus on his moped.

17:05.339 --> 17:09.220
He didn't make it,
and now he gives everyone free Slurpees.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.540
So you see, Jackie, the reason I asked you
to stay with me before...

17:17.619 --> 17:20.619
is because, well, you were right.

17:20.700 --> 17:24.180
I am unpopular.

17:24.220 --> 17:26.180
Go on.

17:28.220 --> 17:31.900
I'm, um, too tall...

17:31.980 --> 17:35.100
and-and red hair is gross.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.300
And, well, if I don't
do something soon...

17:39.380 --> 17:42.420
my unpopularity is gonna
follow me to college-

17:42.460 --> 17:44.380
unless you help.

17:45.340 --> 17:47.580
Please come stay with me.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.940
Jackie-

17:53.020 --> 17:55.540
[Haltingly]
Help me be more like you.

17:59.940 --> 18:04.660
Well, as long as everybody knows
I'm doing it for you...

18:04.700 --> 18:07.980
- I'll do it.
- Great.

18:09.340 --> 18:12.340
Hey, Donna. Thank you.

18:12.380 --> 18:16.580
- You're welcome.
- Okay. First things first.

18:16.660 --> 18:20.660
If you wanna be more popular,
you're gonna have to break up with Eric.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.780
What?

18:28.900 --> 18:32.220
You know, I have been called many
names since coming to this country...

18:32.300 --> 18:34.380
but I have never been
treated like that before.

18:34.460 --> 18:37.020
Look, Fez...

18:37.100 --> 18:39.980
unfortunately, there are
some people in this world...

18:40.060 --> 18:42.660
that are gonna judge you
on the color of your skin...

18:42.740 --> 18:44.780
or your funny accent...

18:44.860 --> 18:47.260
or that girlie little way you run.

18:50.780 --> 18:53.540
But you know what?
You're not alone.

18:53.620 --> 18:56.620
Why do you think
the Martians won't land here?

18:56.700 --> 19:00.660
'Cause they're green, and they know people
are gonna make fun of'em.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.620
You said it, brother.

19:03.700 --> 19:07.460
I just wish there were someplace
in the world where prejudice didn't exist.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.100
Huh.
Well, that's Canada.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.820
Yup.
Good old Canada.

19:16.860 --> 19:18.740
They don't make
generalizations about people...

19:18.820 --> 19:21.100
'cause they're too busy
playing hockey or gettin' drunk...

19:21.180 --> 19:24.340
or putting maple syrup on their ham.

19:24.380 --> 19:29.060
- Fez, we need to talk.
- Hey! He might not be from this country...

19:29.140 --> 19:31.100
but he's beautiful, damn it!

19:34.580 --> 19:38.300
Nina, our relationship is over.
My self-respect demands it...

19:38.380 --> 19:40.700
and there's nothing you can say
to make me change my mind.

19:40.780 --> 19:44.660
My parents are jerks. I wanna get back
at them by doing it with you on their bed.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.900
Except that.
Thanks, Kelso.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.000
[Clanging]

19:58.080 --> 20:00.640
Fire! Fire!

20:02.080 --> 20:04.440
- What are you doing?
- Well, look at this.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.560
Mr. Nude is still nude.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.320
- You're nuts.
- Wow.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.640
Strong words from Mr. Nude.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.280
We're doin' this every night
until you put on some bottoms.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.200
[Clanging]

20:22.280 --> 20:23.560
Fire!

20:23.600 --> 20:24.880
Fire!

20:25.305 --> 20:31.404
