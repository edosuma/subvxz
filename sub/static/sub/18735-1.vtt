00:22.156 --> 00:25.827
I'm not ashamed. I've known love.

00:26.077 --> 00:28.371
I've known rejection.

00:28.621 --> 00:31.291
I'm not afraid to declare my feelings.

00:31.541 --> 00:37.338
Take trust, for instance, or friendship.
These are the important things in life.

00:37.589 --> 00:41.968
These are the things that matter,
that help you on your way.

00:42.218 --> 00:48.683
If you can't trust your friends,
well what then? What then?

00:50.351 --> 00:52.520
This could have been any city.

00:52.770 --> 00:56.983
They're all the same.

02:21.150 --> 02:25.905
Hello. I've come about the room.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.374
- So what's his name?
- I don't know. Campbell or something.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.419
- Cameron.
- Cameron? Really?

02:39.669 --> 02:41.963
That's right.

02:42.213 --> 02:44.674
What?

02:44.924 --> 02:47.176
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes, thanks.

02:47.427 --> 02:49.470
- Have you seen the flat?
- Yes.

02:49.721 --> 02:52.432
- And you like it?
- Yes, it's great.

02:52.682 --> 02:55.476
We all like it. The room's nice,
too, don't you think?

02:55.727 --> 02:59.522
Spacious, bright, all that sort of stuff,
all that sort of crap.

02:59.772 --> 03:01.232
Well, yes.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.903
So tell me, cos I'd like to know,
what on earth could make you think...

03:05.153 --> 03:07.822
.. we'd want to share this flat
with someone like you?

03:08.072 --> 03:13.036
My first impression is that you have none
of the qualities we seek from a flatmate.

03:13.286 --> 03:16.831
I'm talking about things like presence,
charisma, style and charm.

03:17.081 --> 03:20.418
I don't think we're asking too much,
or being unreasonable.

03:20.668 --> 03:24.589
Take David here. An accountant
he may be, but at least he tries hard.

03:24.839 --> 03:27.926
Trouble is, I just don't think you're trying.

03:28.176 --> 03:33.056
Hey, Cameron, I mean this. Good luck.

03:42.607 --> 03:45.151
- Just a few questions.
- What about your hobbies?

03:45.401 --> 03:47.403
- Why do you want a room here?
- Do you smoke?

03:47.654 --> 03:51.449
When you sacrifice a goat and rip
its heart out, do you summon hellfire?

03:51.699 --> 03:55.620
It's a straightforward question.
Either you're divorced or you're not.

03:55.870 --> 03:59.499
- Or do you just send out for a pizza?
- Do a little freebase, maybe?

03:59.749 --> 04:02.335
How do you decide
which shade of black to wear?

04:02.585 --> 04:05.838
OK, I'm going to play you
just a few seconds of this tape.

04:06.089 --> 04:08.424
Name the song, the lead singer,...

04:08.675 --> 04:16.140
...and three hit singles subsequently
recorded by him with another band.

04:23.022 --> 04:27.068
Let me get this straight.
This affair that you're "not" having,...

04:27.318 --> 04:29.612
.. is it not with a man
or not with a woman?

04:29.862 --> 04:32.323
Turning very briefly
to corporate financing...

04:32.574 --> 04:36.869
No, this is important. Leveraged buyouts:
a good or a bad thing?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.747
When did anyone last
say to you these exact words:

04:39.998 --> 04:43.793
"You are the sunshine of my life"?

04:45.086 --> 04:49.591
And how would you react, then,
if I told you I was the Antichrist?

04:53.511 --> 04:57.181
Do you like my picture?

05:07.025 --> 05:09.569
Defeat. Defeat. Defeat.

05:09.819 --> 05:16.242
Sporting, personal, financial,
professional, sexual and everything.

05:16.743 --> 05:20.330
Next.

05:23.750 --> 05:28.463
- Did you know that...?
- Alex. Just serve.

05:30.423 --> 05:35.345
Anyway, I wasn't tryin' to win. I
don't want to devalue your victory, Juliet.

05:35.595 --> 05:38.723
- I wasn't tryin' to win.
- Victory's the same as defeat.

05:38.973 --> 05:40.892
It's giving in to destructive urges.

05:41.142 --> 05:43.853
Did you learn that in
your psychotherapy group?

05:44.103 --> 05:47.065
- Discussion group.
- I thought you'd stopped going.

05:47.315 --> 05:51.903
He had too many of those urges.
You of all people should know about that.

05:52.153 --> 05:54.364
God, you two are sensitive.

05:54.614 --> 05:58.534
All I'm doing is implying some
kind of ugly, sordid, sexual liaison.

05:58.785 --> 06:01.371
- I'd be proud of that.
- Maybe you should go.

06:01.621 --> 06:04.207
- You'll meet someone wonderful.
- For my life?

06:04.457 --> 06:07.710
- A discussion group? I think not.
- For the flat.

06:07.961 --> 06:11.714
No, it'd be someone like him,
and one's enough, thank you very much.

06:11.965 --> 06:16.010
What about that girl? That friend of yours,
the one that came round. I liked her.

06:16.261 --> 06:19.597
We had something. She could have
moved in. We had chemistry.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.766
- She hated you...
- She had problems.

06:22.016 --> 06:26.646
.. more than anyone
she had ever met in her entire life.

06:26.896 --> 06:30.483
Like they say, you know, she's
got to want to change, hasn't she?

06:40.994 --> 06:44.455
- You must be Hugo.
- And you must be Juliet.

06:44.706 --> 06:49.627
- Would you like to come in?
- I'd be delighted.

06:54.924 --> 06:58.261
- What do you do?
- I've been away for a while.

06:58.511 --> 07:01.389
Travelling. And now I'm writing a novel.

07:01.639 --> 07:02.515
Oh.

07:02.765 --> 07:07.562
- What's it about?
- It's actually about a priest who dies.

07:07.812 --> 07:09.772
I see.

07:10.023 --> 07:13.359
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I ought to change it. You're right.

07:13.610 --> 07:16.946
I mean, who wants to read
another story about a dead priest?

07:17.196 --> 07:21.409
In fact, it's about another guy,
he's not a priest, and he lives.

07:21.659 --> 07:25.413
He doesn't die. See? It's better already.

07:25.663 --> 07:28.625
- Writing seems easy.
- It's a breeze. No problem.

07:38.218 --> 07:41.679
Do you think you could answer that?

07:41.930 --> 07:47.227
- What, the telephone?
- But... if it's for me, I'm not here.

07:47.477 --> 07:51.522
Right. You're not here.

07:52.774 --> 07:56.361
OK.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.868
Hello?

08:04.118 --> 08:08.748
Yes, it is, yes. Who's calling, please?

08:09.165 --> 08:14.420
Well, I'm sorry, but she's not...
she's not in right now.

08:14.587 --> 08:18.216
No, I've got absolutely no idea.

08:18.466 --> 08:21.219
Would you like to leave a message?

08:21.469 --> 08:25.056
OK. Goodbye.

08:27.225 --> 08:30.270
That was, um... a guy called Brian.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.313
- Did he sound upset?
- A little bit, yeah.

08:33.565 --> 08:36.275
- Is that good or bad?
- It's an improvement.

08:36.525 --> 08:38.986
Shall I get the phone?

08:39.236 --> 08:43.157
Just leave it. He knows I'm probably
at home. I'm working nights this week.

08:43.408 --> 08:46.119
- You're working nights?
- I'm a doctor.

08:46.369 --> 08:47.120
Ah.

08:47.370 --> 08:52.166
- And he's a patient?
- No, but he needs treatment.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.752
- For what?
- A certain weakness.

08:55.003 --> 08:58.631
- The human condition.
- Oh. You know about it.

08:58.881 --> 09:03.595
- Well, I write about it.
- And that's not the same thing?

09:03.845 --> 09:07.515
No. I'm like all novelists -
on a search of the self.

09:07.765 --> 09:10.268
Has he tried
down the back of the fridge?

09:10.518 --> 09:12.687
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

09:12.937 --> 09:15.732
I'm not saying
he didn't seem like a nice guy.

09:15.982 --> 09:19.569
I just said it's a bit strange,
this search of the self or whatever.

09:19.819 --> 09:22.196
He didn't seem strange, Alex.

09:22.447 --> 09:27.869
He seemed... you know,...

09:28.119 --> 09:32.081
...interesting.
- Interesting?

09:36.711 --> 09:40.298
Interesting.

09:45.261 --> 09:48.598
Hello? No, she's not in.

09:48.848 --> 09:51.351
I don't know. I've no idea.

09:51.601 --> 09:54.020
- Who was it?
- I don't know. He sounded Swedish.

09:54.270 --> 09:57.607
- Do you know any Swedish men?
- No.

09:57.857 --> 09:59.984
Maybe it was just the emotion.

10:00.235 --> 10:02.487
- What do you think?
- About what?

10:02.737 --> 10:05.281
- About this Hugo person.
- I don't have the time.

10:05.531 --> 10:09.285
- I'm just asking what you think.
- I don't care, so long as he's not a freak.

10:09.535 --> 10:12.956
David. It's your mother's
handwriting. I didn't open it.

10:13.206 --> 10:16.709
I don't like reading about
your father's constipation.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.879
- So we'll meet him, then?
- What?

10:20.129 --> 10:25.510
Yeah, yeah, whatever. I tell you, every
letter this guy writes you is the same.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.138
They all begin like true love
and descend into open pornography.

10:29.389 --> 10:33.351
"I dream of your thighs, the touch of
your white skin leading me in desire,...

10:33.601 --> 10:39.607
.. while I, aroused and inflamed... "
Aroused and inflamed?

10:43.820 --> 10:46.406
He even signs them in his own name.

10:46.656 --> 10:51.786
I'd sign someone else's. I'd sign his name.
If I wrote them, that is, which I don't.

10:52.036 --> 10:54.414
Interesting. That's what she said.

10:54.664 --> 10:57.125
Interesting. You see,
that's why you're here.

10:57.375 --> 11:00.378
I don't usually meet people,
unless I already know them.

11:00.628 --> 11:03.047
- I see.
- People can be so cruel.

11:03.298 --> 11:05.508
So, um...

11:05.758 --> 11:08.720
.. well, we think it's fine.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.055
Ah. So, I can have the room?

11:11.306 --> 11:14.434
- Yes, you can have the room.
- I'm not usually drunk.

11:14.684 --> 11:17.896
- Not usually this drunk.
- Only on expenses.

11:18.146 --> 11:20.815
He's going to tell you
he could have been someone.

11:21.065 --> 11:24.777
Instead of what he is, which is
the man we know and love.

11:25.028 --> 11:29.115
.. tired out, empty shell of a...
Know and love?

11:29.365 --> 11:32.243
- I think you're lying.
- You're right.

11:32.493 --> 11:39.083
- You see? They don't really know me.
- No, Alex. We don't really love you.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.087
Can you afford this place?

11:43.338 --> 11:46.925
Oh, yeah.

11:50.345 --> 11:55.183
- Can I ask you a question?
- Certainly.

11:55.850 --> 11:59.812
Have you ever killed a man?

12:05.526 --> 12:07.987
No.

12:12.075 --> 12:15.328
That's fair enough, then.

12:23.086 --> 12:28.591
Well, it certainly smells like the real thing.

13:35.867 --> 13:38.870
Rangers have made a few
dramatic comebacks this season.

13:39.120 --> 13:45.168
But they'll really have to
draw on all of their resources.

13:48.630 --> 13:51.424
- Have you seen Hugo?
- No.

13:51.674 --> 13:54.302
Any idea which channel he's on?

13:54.552 --> 13:57.847
.. the High Court in Edinburgh.

13:58.097 --> 14:00.850
Oh, for fuck's sake.

14:07.482 --> 14:11.569
No, she's not in.

14:19.869 --> 14:22.497
- Have you seen him?
- I don't have the time.

14:22.747 --> 14:27.377
- Yes or no? David, yes or...?
- No!

14:29.629 --> 14:32.048
- David hasn't seen him either.
- So I gathered.

14:32.298 --> 14:33.967
- Maybe he didn't like us.
- David?

14:34.217 --> 14:37.595
- No, Hugo.
- His car's still there.

14:37.845 --> 14:41.140
- He's got a car?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

14:41.391 --> 14:44.185
- What sort of car?
- I don't know, Alex. I'm just a girl.

14:44.435 --> 14:46.563
I'll ask you once more. What sort of car?

14:46.813 --> 14:51.526
A blue one, OK? And it's still there.

15:04.789 --> 15:08.042
Hugo, I'm sorry about this,
but can you open your door?

15:08.293 --> 15:13.881
It's us, your flatmates and companions,
your new-found friends.

15:14.591 --> 15:17.886
- He's not there. I can't see him at all.
- Maybe he's in the wardrobe.

15:18.136 --> 15:20.305
Of course he's not
in the bloody wardrobe.

15:20.555 --> 15:23.892
- It's a joke, Alex.
- I think he probably left.

15:24.142 --> 15:29.230
- We'll probably never see him again.
- Alex, the key is on the other side.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.108
- So?
- Open it.

15:32.358 --> 15:34.277
You want me to kick this in? Now?

15:34.527 --> 15:38.323
- Yeah.
- OK, no problem.

15:45.788 --> 15:49.792
Do you want a go?

15:50.752 --> 15:54.756
OK, you size that up.

16:18.279 --> 16:22.992
- Is this what they always look like?
- Yes.

16:23.576 --> 16:26.537
- Wonder how he did it.
- Did what?

16:26.788 --> 16:31.793
Killed himself.
I presume that's what's happened.

16:32.043 --> 16:33.962
What do you think?

16:34.212 --> 16:36.798
- Alex!
- What? What's wrong?

16:37.048 --> 16:38.883
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.718
- Don't.
- Don't look?

16:40.969 --> 16:43.012
- No.
- Why not?

16:43.263 --> 16:45.807
What's wrong? Don't you
wonder what he died from?

16:46.057 --> 16:50.770
No. The guy's dead.
What more do you need?

16:51.771 --> 16:54.691
It's not every day
I find a story in my own flat.

16:54.941 --> 16:59.779
It's not a story, Alex, it's a corpse.

17:01.906 --> 17:06.160
I've never seen a dead body before.

17:14.544 --> 17:18.089
I saw my grandmother, of course,
but I don't suppose that counts.

17:18.339 --> 17:22.010
She was alive at the time.

17:37.358 --> 17:41.946
Can I show you something?

17:51.497 --> 17:55.084
Emergency. Which service?

17:55.335 --> 17:58.796
Emergency. Which...?

18:03.134 --> 18:05.345
- No.
- Just think about it.

18:05.595 --> 18:07.680
- No.
- Come on, David.

18:07.931 --> 18:10.183
- No.
- Juliet?

18:10.433 --> 18:13.311
- No, Alex. It's...
- It's what?

18:13.561 --> 18:15.271
- Unfeasible.
- Is that all?

18:15.521 --> 18:17.774
- You mean immoral.
- I know what I mean.

18:18.024 --> 18:22.362
- I'm only asking you to think about it.
- It's a sick idea, Alex. It's sick.

18:22.612 --> 18:26.282
But don't tell me you're not tempted.
Don't tell me you're not interested.

18:26.532 --> 18:30.411
- I know you well enough.
- You think so?

18:36.167 --> 18:39.295
Go ahead, then. Telephone.

18:39.545 --> 18:43.466
Telephone the police.

18:43.549 --> 18:46.010
Go ahead. No one's gonna
stand in your way.

18:46.261 --> 18:48.346
Telephone them. Tell them.

18:48.596 --> 18:55.103
Tell them there's a suitcase full
of money, and you don't want it.

19:20.670 --> 19:24.549
# My baby don't care for shows

19:24.799 --> 19:29.596
# My baby don't care for clothes

19:29.804 --> 19:34.893
# My baby just cares for me

19:36.853 --> 19:41.024
# My baby don't care for

19:41.566 --> 19:44.819
# Cars and races

19:45.069 --> 19:48.948
# My baby don't care for

19:50.366 --> 19:53.161
# High-tone places

19:53.411 --> 19:57.707
# Liz Taylor is not his style

19:57.957 --> 20:00.585
Was there a pet
in the house? Yeah, a pet.

20:00.835 --> 20:05.089
You know, like a dog or a budgie
or a gerbil or something?

20:05.340 --> 20:12.096
What I need here is "PC Plod saves Harry
the Hamster from house of horror".

20:13.431 --> 20:17.477
All right. Well, that's a pity.
You see, no pets - no human angle.

20:17.727 --> 20:23.858
# My baby just cares for me

20:29.572 --> 20:33.618
- Hi, there. What happened to that guy?
- What guy?

20:33.868 --> 20:35.828
That guy. The one that died.

20:36.079 --> 20:37.705
- Died?
- That one last week.

20:37.956 --> 20:40.583
- Here?
- Yes, here. Where else?

20:40.833 --> 20:43.711
Oh, him. Well, he died.

20:43.962 --> 20:45.630
That's what I thought.

20:45.880 --> 20:50.802
Hello? Have you got room
for an overnighter?

20:58.017 --> 21:02.605
# My baby don't care

21:02.855 --> 21:05.900
# For cars and races

21:06.150 --> 21:09.988
# Baby don't care for

21:10.238 --> 21:13.116
# He don't care for high-tone places

21:13.366 --> 21:18.705
# And Liz Taylor is not his style

21:18.955 --> 21:22.792
- He's still here?
- Yeah, he couldn't get his car started.

21:23.042 --> 21:25.169
When are you gonna let the police know?

21:25.420 --> 21:28.464
You phone them if you want, David.

21:28.715 --> 21:34.095
- What about you?
- I'm getting used to having him around.

21:34.679 --> 21:38.808
# With baby

21:39.058 --> 21:42.562
# My baby just cares for

21:42.812 --> 21:46.649
# My baby just cares for

21:46.900 --> 21:52.864
# My baby just cares for me #

21:55.867 --> 21:58.202
What is it we do here, David?

21:58.453 --> 22:00.204
- Sorry?
- Here.

22:00.455 --> 22:03.875
- Right here?
- In this firm.

22:04.125 --> 22:07.754
- Well, it's a wide range of...
- Accounting, David.

22:08.004 --> 22:12.926
Chartered accounting is of ten sneered at.
Were you aware of that?

22:13.176 --> 22:17.096
- Not any real sneering as such, no.
- There's a whole wide world out there,...

22:17.347 --> 22:20.350
.. and it all needs to be
accounted for, does it not?

22:20.600 --> 22:23.144
- Well, I...
- They sneer, do they not?

22:23.394 --> 22:25.563
- I'm not sure.
- It's unfashionable.

22:25.813 --> 22:29.234
But yes, we're methodical,
yes, we're diligent, yes, we're serious.

22:29.484 --> 22:33.029
And where's the crime in that?
Why not shout it from the rooftops?

22:33.279 --> 22:37.742
Maybe sometimes we're a wee bit boring,
but, by God, we get the job done.

22:37.992 --> 22:42.580
- Yes, sir.
- That's why I think you fit in here.

22:42.830 --> 22:46.000
- I'm boring?
- You get the job done.

22:46.251 --> 22:53.007
- I see. I thought you meant...
- Which is why I trust you with this client.

23:22.954 --> 23:25.832
Good morning. Can I help you?

23:26.082 --> 23:29.961
Yeah, I'll just check that for you.

23:51.900 --> 23:54.319
Let's do it.

23:54.569 --> 23:58.323
Let's talk about disposal.
We have to make that body unidentifiable.

23:58.573 --> 24:01.868
Burning, dumping at sea
and burial are all flawed,...

24:02.118 --> 24:05.872
.. either by fingerprints or more commonly
by dental records, I have learnt.

24:06.122 --> 24:08.750
What I suggest is that
we bury him out in the forest.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.337
First we remove his hands
and his feet, which we incinerate.

24:12.587 --> 24:16.466
And his teeth, which we just
remove. It's as simple as that.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.260
David.

24:19.510 --> 24:23.890
I've always wondered
what these were for. Now...

24:24.140 --> 24:25.642
Oh.

24:25.892 --> 24:28.228
This is what we need.

24:28.478 --> 24:30.813
And, um...

24:31.064 --> 24:33.191
.. this.

24:33.441 --> 24:34.901
- What else?
- I don't know.

24:35.151 --> 24:36.778
A spade. We need a spade.

24:37.028 --> 24:39.781
I wish you'd concentrate.
We need a spade to dig a pit.

24:40.031 --> 24:41.783
- Who's gonna do it?
- Dig the pit?

24:42.033 --> 24:43.910
- Not that.
- Who's gonna do what?

24:44.160 --> 24:48.081
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Do I? What are you talking about?

24:48.331 --> 24:51.417
- You know what. Who's gonna do it?
- We all are, David.

24:51.668 --> 24:55.797
We're all gonna do it. You, me and Juliet
will do his or her bit. Fair enough?

24:56.047 --> 24:58.049
- I can't do it.
- I don't hear this.

24:58.299 --> 25:01.469
- I won't be able to do it.
- You want out already?

25:01.719 --> 25:04.722
You don't want the money?
Hugo is going off! He smells!

25:04.973 --> 25:11.521
- The flat smells! We can't wait!
- I won't be able to cut him up.

25:25.785 --> 25:29.455
- Who's going to do it?
- I thought we all were.

25:29.706 --> 25:32.750
- I don't think I can.
- But, Juliet, you're a doctor.

25:33.001 --> 25:38.131
- You kill people every day.
- That's different. I still don't want to.

25:38.381 --> 25:42.385
Now you tell me.

26:03.573 --> 26:05.491
There's something I want to ask.

26:05.742 --> 26:10.204
I don't know! I swear to God, I don't know!

26:11.748 --> 26:14.000
Family? Friends?

26:14.250 --> 26:18.421
Drugged-up, wandering, suicidal
fuck-ups don't have families.

26:18.671 --> 26:23.468
- I just thought we should discuss it.
- Take his legs.

26:26.971 --> 26:30.558
Where's Hugo?

27:20.066 --> 27:23.403
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

27:23.653 --> 27:27.699
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

27:29.409 --> 27:33.871
I swear to God, I don't know! I don't know!

28:24.672 --> 28:27.091
Stupid fuckin' bastard.

28:35.683 --> 28:37.810
Why don't we draw lots for it?

28:38.061 --> 28:42.315
Whoever draws the short straw does it all.
That way you either do it or you don't.

28:42.565 --> 28:44.943
- OK. I can go with that.
- David?

28:45.193 --> 28:48.863
- I don't know.
- If I draw the short straw, I'll do it.

28:49.113 --> 28:54.744
But I'm not gonna do it
just because you won't.

29:33.533 --> 29:36.953
All right, then. Here we are and this is it.

29:37.203 --> 29:41.457
Do you wanna play or not?

30:17.160 --> 30:21.164
I can't do it.

31:01.454 --> 31:06.084
- Finished.
- All right, but not quite.

31:06.459 --> 31:09.087
- Is that going to be deep enough?
- Don't worry.

31:09.337 --> 31:14.884
- Is this necessary?
- Yes. Now come on. All or nothin'.

32:01.014 --> 32:05.268
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. I'm fine, thanks. Just fine.

32:05.518 --> 32:09.731
- Would you like to talk about it?
- No.

32:28.333 --> 32:33.254
These three people
get their chance to...

32:33.504 --> 32:37.508
.. lose a million.

32:56.861 --> 33:01.616
Yes, all right. Hello there and welcome
aboard our millionaire's yacht.

33:01.866 --> 33:05.745
It's just like the "Marie Celeste"
but without the party atmosphere.

33:05.995 --> 33:09.916
As you know, the object is not
to win the game, but to...

33:10.166 --> 33:11.793
Lose.

33:12.043 --> 33:14.462
Not to give right answers, but...

33:14.712 --> 33:17.757
- Wrong ones.
- Not to do well, but to do really...

33:18.007 --> 33:20.093
Badly.

33:20.343 --> 33:25.640
And above all to try
and make a total... hotchpotch.

33:33.314 --> 33:36.901
Be careful.

33:54.544 --> 33:57.880
Alex!

34:03.636 --> 34:07.181
I don't know why we couldn't
stuff it under the floorboards.

34:07.432 --> 34:13.271
- Stop nagging, Alex.
- We could have hid it in the fridge.

35:28.137 --> 35:33.142
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention, please?

35:33.393 --> 35:35.895
I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight,...

35:36.145 --> 35:41.651
.. to help us raise funds
for the sick children's unit.

35:41.985 --> 35:44.946
You never told me this was for children.
I hate children.

35:45.196 --> 35:51.703
I'd raise money to have the little fuckers
put down. I want my money back!

35:52.036 --> 35:54.080
But before the dancing starts...

35:54.330 --> 35:57.333
- Excuse me!
- .. I would like to give a vote of thanks...

35:57.584 --> 36:03.631
.. to the few people who have worked
so hard to make this occasion happen.

36:03.881 --> 36:06.551
- Do you know these people?
- They're my friends.

36:06.801 --> 36:11.055
Oh, so if they want to speak to you,
we tell them that you're not here?

36:11.306 --> 36:18.563
But ladies and gentlemen and those
of you who are neither or both...

36:18.605 --> 36:24.360
- Where did they dig him up?
- Form sets for "Strip the Willow".

36:25.820 --> 36:31.492
- Are we going to dance?
- Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?

37:46.401 --> 37:49.946
OK.

37:49.988 --> 37:51.906
Talk to me.

37:52.156 --> 37:53.908
Talk to me.

37:57.787 --> 38:03.084
- OK.
- No! Don't! Please don't!

38:06.421 --> 38:08.590
No! No!

38:08.840 --> 38:12.427
Please!

38:27.358 --> 38:30.069
- Can we talk about something?
- Not now. I have an idea.

38:30.320 --> 38:36.367
- It's important. We need to decide...
- Will you just stop worrying?

38:37.702 --> 38:40.830
To love and to happiness for ever.

38:41.080 --> 38:44.876
For ever and ever.

38:48.671 --> 38:50.673
- What's wrong?
- I want to talk now.

38:50.924 --> 38:52.926
When you've drunk
to love and happiness.

38:53.176 --> 38:54.177
- Now.
- After.

38:54.427 --> 38:56.846
David, I promise we will.
Just keep him happy.

38:57.096 --> 39:02.393
It's not for me. It's for love
and happiness for ever.

39:07.941 --> 39:10.193
Look over there. It's Cameron.

39:10.443 --> 39:12.237
- Who?
- You remember Cameron.

39:12.487 --> 39:13.947
- No.
- What's he doing here?

39:14.197 --> 39:16.532
- That's not him.
- It is. Cameron!

39:16.783 --> 39:20.912
Cameron, come on over here. Come on.

39:21.871 --> 39:24.582
What?

39:24.832 --> 39:28.211
Nothing. We thought
you were someone else.

39:28.461 --> 39:30.755
Good luck!

39:31.005 --> 39:34.968
- Why does he have to follow us around?
- What I was wanting to say was this.

39:35.218 --> 39:36.219
Aha!

39:36.469 --> 39:39.806
- The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
- Brian.

39:40.056 --> 39:42.976
- Would you care to dance?
- Hold on. Who do you think you are?

39:43.226 --> 39:45.061
- What?
- Who do you think you are?

39:45.311 --> 39:49.566
- You interrupted us.
- I'm Brian Mckinley. And who are you?

39:49.816 --> 39:55.280
Well, Brian Mckinley, if you wanna talk
to my girlfriend, you talk to me first.

39:55.530 --> 39:58.408
If you wanna dance, you apply
three weeks in advance,...

39:58.658 --> 40:01.119
.. or you're gonna end up
inside a fucking bin bag!

40:01.369 --> 40:05.999
You didn't apply, so you don't dance.

40:11.379 --> 40:14.257
Do you think you could be
a little more forceful next time?

40:14.507 --> 40:18.720
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. I think he got the message.

40:18.970 --> 40:20.972
That was quite stressful.

40:21.222 --> 40:25.560
Yeah, but you were good. He was
really good. Fuckin' bin bag, I like that.

40:25.810 --> 40:29.647
You really explored
your maleness to the full there.

40:29.898 --> 40:32.442
- You think so?
- You certainly had a good look around.

40:32.692 --> 40:36.279
You were magnificent.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.198
Yeah.

40:39.449 --> 40:43.036
Fuckin' bin bag.

41:05.683 --> 41:09.270
Fuckin' bin bag.

41:14.025 --> 41:17.779
Cameron! What a surprise!

42:08.746 --> 42:12.041
Hello?

42:12.292 --> 42:15.712
Hello?

42:22.176 --> 42:25.013
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

42:25.263 --> 42:29.851
- No one said anything.
- Or rendered speechless with desire.

42:30.101 --> 42:33.813
I recall that feeling from
the days when I had such a thing.

42:34.063 --> 42:38.067
- Are you all right?
- No.

42:39.569 --> 42:43.781
Then let's spend some money.

42:44.782 --> 42:49.078
Hello. It's been a struggle,
but now our days of worry are over.

42:49.329 --> 42:52.999
The light at the end of the tunnel
has expanded into a golden sunrise.

42:53.249 --> 43:00.465
And now at last, at long last,
nothing will ever be the same again.

43:46.761 --> 43:50.056
This is Alex Law reporting on
the video diary of his own life.

43:50.306 --> 43:52.850
Let me tell you, I'm so happy I could die.

44:02.110 --> 44:05.071
I think we ought to stop this, don't you?

44:05.321 --> 44:08.408
- Oh, will you relax?
- You're making us all nervous.

44:08.658 --> 44:11.786
- How much did you pay for this?
- I don't know.

44:12.036 --> 44:14.247
- I can't remember.
- Tell me how much you paid.

44:14.497 --> 44:17.208
- I can't remember.
- How much did you pay for this?

44:17.458 --> 44:21.004
- No idea. I don't know.
- How much did you pay for this?!

44:21.254 --> 44:25.174
- £500.
- £500?

44:25.425 --> 44:28.720
You paid £500 for this?

44:28.970 --> 44:32.390
- That's what it cost.
- No. That's what you paid for it.

44:32.640 --> 44:38.021
£500 is what you paid for it.
We don't know how much it cost us yet.

44:38.271 --> 44:43.443
For you two to have a good time.
We don't know the cost of that yet.

45:25.526 --> 45:29.656
Excuse me. Did they take anything?

45:37.956 --> 45:39.958
Is that enough for you?

45:40.208 --> 45:41.626
Oi.

45:41.876 --> 45:44.045
- What?
- Is that enough for you?

45:44.295 --> 45:46.881
- Yes, that's fine.
- There's plenty more.

45:47.131 --> 45:50.718
That's fine.

45:55.932 --> 45:57.141
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

45:57.392 --> 45:59.143
- You're not eating.
- Eating what?

45:59.394 --> 46:05.984
- You're not eating like you used to.
- If you give me the plate, I'll eat.

46:18.871 --> 46:22.458
Now swallow.

46:26.838 --> 46:29.674
You should spend some money
instead of worrying about it.

46:29.924 --> 46:33.303
- You'd feel much better.
- Once it's spent, you don't have to worry.

46:33.553 --> 46:37.098
- It'll be a weight off your shoulders.
- You know we're right.

46:37.348 --> 46:40.852
- I wanna secure it.
- Secure it? You wanna put it in a bank?

46:41.102 --> 46:44.147
You don't wanna put it in a bank, do you?
Do you want to bury it?

46:44.397 --> 46:48.526
- I don't see the point. It's stupid.
- Course it's stupid. We took the money.

46:48.776 --> 46:51.112
It was a material calculation.

46:51.362 --> 46:55.241
What's the point if it's underground
in some funny bank in some funny place?

46:55.491 --> 46:58.828
If you can't have it - spend it -
then what use is it? None.

46:59.078 --> 47:03.583
It's all for nothing. I didn't get into this
for nothing, so that I could have nothing.

47:03.833 --> 47:08.254
Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.

47:14.886 --> 47:19.015
Tastes different.

47:49.837 --> 47:54.217
David, what are you doin' up there?

47:58.888 --> 48:03.977
Will you come down now?
It's not safe up there.

48:13.444 --> 48:16.614
Are you listening to me?

48:16.864 --> 48:21.744
Security and insanity
are not the same thing.

48:25.123 --> 48:28.710
Shit.

49:06.789 --> 49:11.669
I don't care. A grown man shouldn't
be living in a loft. He isn't safe up there.

49:11.920 --> 49:16.424
If you cared about him at all,
you'd use your influence to get him down.

49:16.674 --> 49:19.052
- And the money?
- We could put it somewhere.

49:19.302 --> 49:22.096
Where he can't get it?

49:22.347 --> 49:24.599
Well, you thought of that, not me.

49:24.849 --> 49:28.853
Forget it. He'll come down.

49:28.895 --> 49:32.440
Oh, Juliet, look.

49:49.290 --> 49:51.876
Hello, Mr Lumsden.
It's David Stevens here.

49:52.126 --> 49:55.046
I'm sorry, sir. I won't be able
to make it to the office today.

49:55.296 --> 50:00.301
It's my mother, sir. She's very ill
and I think I need to be with her just now.

50:00.552 --> 50:04.722
I don't know. The doctors aren't sure.
It could go either way.

50:04.973 --> 50:09.269
Yes, sir. I'll certainly stay in touch.

50:42.385 --> 50:43.928
- Good day?
- What?

50:44.178 --> 50:46.514
- Good day?
- What are you talking about?

50:46.764 --> 50:49.851
- I'm just asking if you had a good day.
- Why?

50:50.101 --> 50:52.854
Well, I thought I'd make conversation.

50:53.104 --> 50:57.317
Please, I'd rather you didn't.

50:57.567 --> 51:00.904
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

51:01.154 --> 51:07.535
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

52:09.389 --> 52:14.602
It's in the loft! In the loft!

55:27.879 --> 55:30.465
September 19, London Heathrow
to Rio de Janeiro.

55:30.715 --> 55:34.719
It's British Airways.
You're looking at £765. That's 7-6-5.

55:34.969 --> 55:37.722
- That sounds fine.
- Air Portugal, on the other hand,...

55:37.972 --> 55:43.811
.. it's via Lisbon, the same day.
It's £565. 5-6-5. Is catering important?

55:44.062 --> 55:46.773
- What?
- Air France, Glasgow direct.

55:47.023 --> 55:50.610
But then you're looking at
the wrong end of £912. That's 9-1-2.

55:50.860 --> 55:54.072
- The first one was fine. Heathrow direct.
- It's up to you.

55:54.322 --> 55:59.285
Air Patagonia, that's a new outfit.
Via... via lots of different places, really.

55:59.535 --> 56:05.625
It's no catering. That's £411. 4-1-1.
It's good value, but refuelling at Bogotá...

56:05.875 --> 56:08.419
The first one was fine.

56:08.670 --> 56:13.216
It's up to you. 7-6-5.
How will you be paying?

56:34.904 --> 56:39.242
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

56:47.500 --> 56:49.794
Oh, my God!

56:50.044 --> 56:52.005
Christ!

56:52.255 --> 56:57.135
No, no. Dear God. No! Christ!

57:35.256 --> 57:37.884
No, and that's it.
I refuse to discuss it any further.

57:38.134 --> 57:39.677
- It's the only way.
- I refuse.

57:39.928 --> 57:43.681
- You're frightened.
- I'm not frightened. I'm a little terrified.

57:43.932 --> 57:46.517
Did you see what happened
to the last two people?

57:46.768 --> 57:49.354
They went up alive and
they came back down dead.

57:49.604 --> 57:53.566
Did you notice that? The difference,
I mean. Alive, dead - dead, alive.

57:53.816 --> 57:57.153
It wasn't difficult to spot.

57:57.403 --> 57:59.697
He killed them both.

57:59.948 --> 58:04.285
- He cut them up.
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

58:04.535 --> 58:09.874
- And how's that?
- Because you're smarter than he is.

58:11.709 --> 58:16.381
Yeah, well, that's what
I've always thought.

58:41.698 --> 58:45.785
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector
McCall. This is DC Mitchell.

58:46.035 --> 58:48.079
I wonder if we could ask some questions.

58:48.329 --> 58:50.957
- What about?
- It's about the burglary.

58:51.207 --> 58:54.419
- Burglary?
- Downstairs.

58:54.669 --> 58:58.590
- Of course.
- Can we come in?

58:58.840 --> 59:01.676
So I just heard
her cries for help and all that.

59:01.926 --> 59:04.804
When I went downstairs,
there were other people there.

59:05.054 --> 59:08.933
So I just stood around, you know,
waiting, the way people do.

59:09.183 --> 59:12.478
And when your colleagues arrived,
I came back upstairs.

59:12.729 --> 59:17.317
That's about all, I think. I didn't actually
see anything useful, I don't think.

59:17.567 --> 59:20.153
And the other three people,
did they hear anything?

59:20.403 --> 59:24.908
There are only two
other people in the flat.

59:31.497 --> 59:35.752
- Two?
- Who said there were four?

59:36.085 --> 59:40.340
We understood there were four people
living here. Not always, but now four.

59:40.590 --> 59:43.426
No, three. Who said there were four?

59:43.676 --> 59:48.056
How strange. And how unsatisfactory
to have misleading information.

59:48.306 --> 59:50.600
Only three people here?

59:50.850 --> 59:53.144
- You're sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

59:53.394 --> 59:55.438
Who said there were four?

59:55.688 --> 01:00:00.401
Make a note of that, Mitchell.
Only three rather than four. Write it down.

01:00:00.652 --> 01:00:03.404
You can use numbers or words.
I've no preference.

01:00:03.655 --> 01:00:06.616
- Which are you using?
- Both, sir.

01:00:06.866 --> 01:00:09.786
Excellent.

01:00:10.036 --> 01:00:12.914
DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr Stevens.

01:00:13.164 --> 01:00:17.001
Under my tutelage, he will
undoubtedly make the grade.

01:00:17.252 --> 01:00:21.256
- I see.
- I doubt it.

01:00:22.257 --> 01:00:24.259
- You'll wait in the hall?
- I'll wait.

01:00:24.509 --> 01:00:28.763
If it sounds like I'm getting killed,
call the police and tell them everything.

01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:31.724
Except maybe that it was
his idea in the first place.

01:00:31.975 --> 01:00:34.227
That's important.
I need to die misunderstood.

01:00:34.477 --> 01:00:36.020
- Alex.
- What?

01:00:36.271 --> 01:00:41.442
As smart as you are,
you might need a little help.

01:00:43.027 --> 01:00:49.492
David, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
open this lock and I'm gonna come up.

01:00:49.742 --> 01:00:55.331
But what's really important
is that you remain calm. OK?

01:01:41.085 --> 01:01:42.337
Alex?

01:01:42.587 --> 01:01:46.591
It's all right. It's just a pigeon.

01:02:00.897 --> 01:02:04.943
Well, he isn't up here.

01:02:08.446 --> 01:02:12.450
Tell him to look for the money.

01:02:17.497 --> 01:02:19.207
Look for the money.

01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:24.212
Don't worry.
That's exactly what I'm doin'.

01:02:34.305 --> 01:02:38.560
It's not up here. He has eaten it.

01:03:02.834 --> 01:03:05.837
Are you looking for me?

01:03:06.087 --> 01:03:08.131
Looking for you, yeah.

01:03:08.381 --> 01:03:12.093
What for? What did you want?
The money? Was that it?

01:03:12.343 --> 01:03:14.470
We just wanted to talk to you.

01:03:14.721 --> 01:03:20.310
Who else have you just wanted to talk to?
Maybe you thought they'd already got me.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.564
- Who?
- Your friends.

01:03:25.064 --> 01:03:28.818
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

01:03:29.068 --> 01:03:33.364
He doesn't know, David.

01:03:35.658 --> 01:03:38.286
Maybe you don't.

01:03:38.536 --> 01:03:41.080
I'm talking about the police.

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:14.085
I thought you'd gone to work.

01:07:14.377 --> 01:07:18.172
With a face like this?

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:38.234
Alex, the editor wants to see you.

01:07:46.743 --> 01:07:51.372
- I'm sorry.
- So you should be.

01:07:54.125 --> 01:07:58.546
Maybe we can still sort everything out.

01:08:02.842 --> 01:08:07.055
Well, we can certainly try.

01:08:09.432 --> 01:08:14.145
Three bodies. Decomposed.
Mutilated beyond recognition.

01:08:14.395 --> 01:08:17.857
- I don't know anythin' about it.
- Of course you don't.

01:08:18.107 --> 01:08:21.653
If you knew anything about it,
I wouldn't have to send you to cover it.

01:08:21.903 --> 01:08:25.531
- Cover it?
- That's right. This is your break, son.

01:08:25.782 --> 01:08:28.368
Cover it?

01:08:30.787 --> 01:08:34.374
Jesus.

01:08:49.389 --> 01:08:52.975
Ow!

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:12.013
All right. The releasable and printworthy
facts of the day so far are as follows.

01:10:12.263 --> 01:10:16.559
Late yesterday, forestry workers
came across one set of human remains...

01:10:16.809 --> 01:10:19.646
.. in a grave which appeared
to have been recently dug.

01:10:19.896 --> 01:10:25.068
Further excavation revealed another
deeper grave with two sets of remains.

01:10:25.318 --> 01:10:31.199
- Is this a serial killer?
- How come they haven't been identified?

01:10:31.449 --> 01:10:35.787
- Any obvious motive here?
- Is it true that one has been skinned?

01:10:36.037 --> 01:10:38.289
Not entirely.

01:10:38.539 --> 01:10:42.001
All right, all right.
An area of skin "has" been removed.

01:10:42.252 --> 01:10:46.756
And you'd better keep this to yourselves.
There's no hands, no feet, no teeth.

01:10:47.006 --> 01:10:49.884
The face is totally
unrecognisable and, yes,...

01:10:50.134 --> 01:10:54.556
.. skin has been removed
from one of the bodies.

01:10:54.889 --> 01:10:57.058
As and when the corpses are removed,...

01:10:57.308 --> 01:11:01.604
.. we will endeavour to ascertain the
mode of death and duration of burial,...

01:11:01.854 --> 01:11:06.609
.. as well as identification, which
will of course be passed on to you,...

01:11:06.859 --> 01:11:11.364
.. after informing,
where possible, the next of kin.

01:11:58.202 --> 01:12:01.289
- Are you OK?
- Yes, of course.

01:12:01.539 --> 01:12:05.543
Why wouldn't I be?

01:12:06.336 --> 01:12:12.258
- I don't know. I just thought maybe...
- We were just sorting things out.

01:12:13.301 --> 01:12:15.887
- You'd better read all about it.
- We already know.

01:12:16.137 --> 01:12:17.722
It was on the television.

01:12:17.972 --> 01:12:20.600
Of course, but print
provides a more lucid and...

01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:22.894
Oh, shut up, Alex.

01:12:23.144 --> 01:12:27.232
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't
deep enough and you wouldn't listen.

01:12:27.482 --> 01:12:29.484
It doesn't necessarily matter.

01:12:29.734 --> 01:12:33.988
They don't know who they are and have
nothing to connect us with them. Nothing.

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:36.532
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex.

01:12:36.783 --> 01:12:39.035
It makes us feel a whole lot better.

01:12:39.285 --> 01:12:45.208
- I beg your pardon?
- It makes us feel a whole lot better.

01:12:45.792 --> 01:12:49.379
That's what I thought he said.

01:13:13.444 --> 01:13:15.363
Shh. Stop.

01:13:15.613 --> 01:13:17.824
What are you doin' here?

01:13:18.074 --> 01:13:20.034
It's about me and David.

01:13:20.285 --> 01:13:24.539
- The perfect couple, I should say.
- You mustn't take it so badly.

01:13:24.789 --> 01:13:29.335
Don't worry. I'd do exactly the same
thing, only I don't think I'm his type.

01:13:29.586 --> 01:13:34.215
- Don't you ever stop?
- No.

01:13:58.907 --> 01:14:02.243
Take all the time you like, Doctor.

01:14:02.493 --> 01:14:05.663
No, I've never seen any of them.

01:14:05.914 --> 01:14:09.500
Look again, if you like.

01:14:14.714 --> 01:14:17.258
I'm sorry, I haven't seen them.

01:14:17.508 --> 01:14:21.054
- Do you have a good memory for faces?
- The same as everyone else.

01:14:21.304 --> 01:14:26.017
But in your work you must meet lots of
people every day. New people, new faces.

01:14:26.267 --> 01:14:27.727
Yes.

01:14:27.977 --> 01:14:30.521
What do you recognise most,
names or faces?

01:14:30.772 --> 01:14:33.816
Diseases.

01:14:34.067 --> 01:14:38.238
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

01:14:38.488 --> 01:14:43.243
- I suppose so.
- I meant, that's what it's like.

01:14:43.493 --> 01:14:45.870
- Sorry?
- You said you supposed so.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.666
- I wasn't offering it for debate.
- He wasn't offering it for debate.

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:54.879
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:23.199
No, I've never seen
any of these men before.

01:15:23.449 --> 01:15:27.120
Take a look at the first two.

01:15:29.372 --> 01:15:31.291
No, I don't know them.

01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:38.798
If I told you their car was parked outside
just now, would that surprise you?

01:15:41.926 --> 01:15:46.139
Yes, I suppose so.

01:15:48.349 --> 01:15:50.435
Well, is it?

01:15:50.685 --> 01:15:53.855
- What?
- Parked there?

01:15:54.105 --> 01:15:56.608
No. Not any more.

01:15:56.858 --> 01:16:01.446
I just wondered if it would surprise you.

01:16:02.822 --> 01:16:04.490
- That's it.
- That's all?

01:16:04.741 --> 01:16:06.576
Yes.

01:16:06.826 --> 01:16:12.415
- Sorry to waste your time.
- Oh, not at all. Don't worry.

01:16:13.207 --> 01:16:15.501
- One thing.
- Your watch.

01:16:15.752 --> 01:16:18.463
- Your watch.
- Is it real?

01:16:18.713 --> 01:16:23.343
Oh, no. It's a fake. I got it in Thailand.
The second hand doesn't sweep.

01:16:23.593 --> 01:16:27.180
- I see.
- Right.

01:16:27.222 --> 01:16:31.392
Tell you what. If you do
remember these guys,...

01:16:31.643 --> 01:16:35.521
.. maybe you could give me
a phone on this number.

01:16:35.772 --> 01:16:39.901
Any time you like.

01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:49.452
I didn't tell them anything, nothing
at all, absolutely nothing. They're plods.

01:16:49.702 --> 01:16:54.791
If they had any witnesses, any forensic
evidence, they would have whipped it out.

01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:58.419
- They know.
- They can know all they like.

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:00.838
- They know.
- So? They know.

01:17:01.089 --> 01:17:04.717
So what? There's nothing
to connect us with that body stuff.

01:17:04.968 --> 01:17:09.931
- Except the money.
- He's right, Alex. They know.

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:54.387
Come on.

01:19:54.637 --> 01:19:56.347
My office is closed.

01:19:56.598 --> 01:19:59.350
Life, however, grinds on
towards its conclusion.

01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:04.647
In the meantime, you may wish to leave a
message, but the final decision is yours.

01:20:10.111 --> 01:20:14.741
David? You forgot to wake me.

01:20:25.835 --> 01:20:30.256
- So let's go.
- You and me?

01:20:30.798 --> 01:20:34.802
Together.

01:20:35.261 --> 01:20:40.934
Hey! Alex! Who are you calling
at this time of night?

01:20:45.688 --> 01:20:49.275
Come out here and talk to us.

01:21:04.499 --> 01:21:08.253
Well? Sex lines, is that it?

01:21:08.503 --> 01:21:11.965
Triple-X-rated, interactive fantasies?
Old habits die hard.

01:21:12.215 --> 01:21:16.052
- I was phoning your mother.
- You old devil.

01:21:16.302 --> 01:21:19.806
Well, anyway.
As you can see, we're leaving.

01:21:20.056 --> 01:21:23.017
- So I gathered.
- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:26.854
- Don't worry. I'll forward your mail.
- No, really.

01:21:27.105 --> 01:21:31.693
I am sorry. Sorry to be ducking out on
you. I hope you won't take it personally.

01:21:31.943 --> 01:21:35.321
No, no. Don't let it worry you.
It's probably for the best.

01:21:35.572 --> 01:21:41.202
All for the best. Exactly. I wouldn't
want things to end on a downer.

01:21:41.452 --> 01:21:44.372
- Not at all.
- I mean, we've ups and downs, right.

01:21:44.622 --> 01:21:47.709
Good times, bad times.

01:21:47.959 --> 01:21:50.461
We could talk all night,
but we have to go. Don't we?

01:21:50.712 --> 01:21:52.964
Yes.

01:21:53.214 --> 01:21:57.427
- And you need your sleep.
- Yes.

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:04.267
No, I can't think of
anything else that matters.

01:22:04.517 --> 01:22:07.395
- About your mail.
- Very good of you to offer, but...

01:22:07.645 --> 01:22:09.689
Where do you think you'll go?

01:22:09.939 --> 01:22:12.442
Where will we go?

01:22:12.692 --> 01:22:14.694
Where will we go?

01:22:14.944 --> 01:22:16.905
Juliet?

01:22:17.155 --> 01:22:19.824
- I don't know.
- Don't be so coy, dear.

01:22:20.074 --> 01:22:22.285
You're going to Rio.

01:22:22.535 --> 01:22:25.288
- What?
- That's right.

01:22:25.538 --> 01:22:27.999
Rio de Janeiro, on your own.

01:22:28.249 --> 01:22:33.796
You should know.
You bought the fucking ticket!

01:22:37.759 --> 01:22:40.470
Did you see that?

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:44.349
I bet she didn't show you that before
she sent you up there. What did she say?

01:22:44.599 --> 01:22:49.520
We'll split it together,
you and me, fifty-fifty.

01:22:51.231 --> 01:22:53.399
But I bet you didn't say you'd split on him.

01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:56.861
- It wasn't like that.
- Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.

01:22:57.111 --> 01:23:00.698
I bought it.

01:23:01.115 --> 01:23:03.660
What?

01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:06.829
I bought the tickets.
For her and for me. It was my idea.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.415
Your idea. I see.

01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:11.501
Well, that fits.

01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:16.464
I mean, you and him fit together.
I should have seen that a long time ago.

01:23:16.714 --> 01:23:19.801
- Alex, stop him!
- No, let him go. Let him have it all.

01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:24.055
Juliet, let him go.

01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:29.477
I'm leaving.

01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:42.156
You shouldn't have hit her! Do what
you like, but you shouldn't have hit her!

01:23:57.463 --> 01:24:00.675
You want it?

01:24:00.925 --> 01:24:02.218
You want it?

01:24:02.468 --> 01:24:05.471
Aagh!

01:24:05.847 --> 01:24:09.851
You bastard!

01:25:59.294 --> 01:26:03.339
You did the right thing.

01:26:03.381 --> 01:26:07.302
But I can't take you with me.

01:27:19.249 --> 01:27:21.584
Be OK, Mummy.

01:27:21.834 --> 01:27:25.546
Oh, I'll be all right.

01:27:44.983 --> 01:27:48.570
Hello, Inspector.

01:28:13.094 --> 01:28:16.931
# It's the sound that lovers

01:28:17.181 --> 01:28:21.436
# Hear when they discover

01:28:21.686 --> 01:28:30.403
# There could be no other for their love

01:28:30.653 --> 01:28:36.868
# It's my happy heart you hear

01:28:37.118 --> 01:28:40.955
# Singing loud and singing clear

01:28:41.205 --> 01:28:45.418
# And it's all because you're near

01:28:45.668 --> 01:28:49.422
# Me, my love

01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:53.968
# Take my happy heart away

01:28:54.219 --> 01:28:58.139
# Let me love you night and day

01:28:58.389 --> 01:29:02.518
# In your arms I wanna stay

01:29:02.769 --> 01:29:09.400
# Oh, my love #

01:29:10.902 --> 01:29:14.280
Oh, yes. I believe in friends.

01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:16.741
I believe we need them.

01:29:16.991 --> 01:29:21.162
But, if one day you find that
you just can't trust them any more,...

01:29:21.412 --> 01:29:23.665
.. well what then?

01:29:23.915 --> 01:29:27.502
What then?

01:29:29.379 --> 01:29:33.383
# Music fills my soul now

01:29:33.633 --> 01:29:37.637
# I've lost all control now

01:29:37.887 --> 01:29:41.266
# I'm not half, I'm whole now

01:29:41.516 --> 01:29:46.396
# With your love

01:29:46.646 --> 01:29:52.735
# It's my happy heart you hear

01:29:52.986 --> 01:29:57.031
# Singing loud and singing clear

01:29:57.282 --> 01:30:01.536
# And it's all because you're near

01:30:01.786 --> 01:30:05.540
# Me, my love

01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:09.794
# Take my happy heart away

01:30:10.044 --> 01:30:14.090
# Let me love you night and day

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:18.303
# In your arms I wanna stay

01:30:18.553 --> 01:30:24.183
# All night long #

01:30:25.305 --> 01:30:31.463
