02:34.529 --> 02:38.742
It all began
when the Tucker forest was haunted

02:38.825 --> 02:41.536
by a certain band of outlaws.

They were called the Melancholy Men.

[donkey snorts]

02:49.878 --> 02:52.380
The reason they were so melancholy

02:52.464 --> 02:55.633
was 'cause they were so rotten
at being rotten.

I wasn't huntin'. I was making music.

While you keep Sir Pete
busy in the tournament.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.756
Right. Keep Sir Pete busy.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.924
How do I do that?

11:15.008 --> 11:18.261
Just do what the book
says and you'll be fine.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.889
Oh, yeah. The book.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.728
[trumpet fanfare]

11:27.645 --> 11:32.108
I-- I don't see anybody 10
feet tall in a black Hood.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.401
He's here.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.029
And he'll give himself away
sooner or later.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.489
Let's get started.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.700
Citizens, citizens, be seated

11:40.784 --> 11:43.495

11:56.966 --> 11:58.885
What's the matter, cowards,

11:58.968 --> 12:01.930

12:02.013 --> 12:04.099
Couldn't be because
I won every tournament

12:04.182 --> 12:07.686

12:16.444 --> 12:19.030

12:19.114 --> 12:20.532
or anything like that.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.952
Well, watch this and weep, peasant.

12:24.035 --> 12:27.872
Actually, I prefer the term
"itinerant serf".

12:27.956 --> 12:29.541
[Pete] Bull's-eye.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.209

12:40.010 --> 12:42.387
Ah, the trusty bow and arrow--

12:42.470 --> 12:46.683
the perfect marriage
of tensile strength and delicacy,

12:46.975 --> 12:48.977
of tension and release.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.311
[boing]

12:50.395 --> 12:51.813
Nice tone.

12:53.398 --> 12:57.152
This arrow is truly the feathered friend

12:57.235 --> 13:00.572
of every fighting man worth his salt.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.782
Place the arrow's feathered end

13:02.866 --> 13:05.118
into the bowstring.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.829
I said the feathered end!

13:08.747 --> 13:10.582
I never played one of these things before.

13:10.665 --> 13:11.499
Good.

13:11.583 --> 13:16.212
Now smoothly and firmly
draw the bowstring backward

13:16.296 --> 13:18.214

14:02.467 --> 14:04.177

14:04.260 --> 14:06.471
since the Prince's first marriage.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.892
Wow! I'm hot tonight.

[narrator] In the joust,

14:26.991 --> 14:29.828

Well, I'd rather have knobby
knees than knock-knees.

15:39.856 --> 15:43.401
Knock-knees?
It's Sir Goofy of knock-knees.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.028
It's Goofin' Hood!

15:47.155 --> 15:49.699
Arrest him! Uh, give him a fair trial,

15:49.783 --> 15:51.659
then have him beheaded.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.872
You gotta love the criminal
justice system in this town.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.545
[Goofin' Hood] The good news is
that I won the tournament.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.299
The bad news is that I'm gonna
be beheaded in the morning.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.927
Boy, imagine if I'd lost.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.394
The birth of the blues?

16:17.519 --> 16:20.480
No, it means that pipsqueak Freddy

16:20.563 --> 16:22.816
is convicting Pistol of treason.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.568
Don't you worry about a thing,
Your Majesty.

[Goofin' Hood] Right key?
Why didn't you say so?

16:53.555 --> 16:54.639
I'm a musician.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.016
Keys are my business.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.935
All I need is some
horsehair to make a bow.

16:59.060 --> 17:03.148
Now, where are we gonna
get horsehair in a dungeon?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.517
through the night

20:25.600 --> 20:27.769
and into the morning.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.771
Until finally,

20:29.896 --> 20:32.941
Goofin' Hood and King
Richard emerged victorious.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.527
So, Sir Goofy of Knock-knees

20:35.610 --> 20:37.445
became the royal musician.

20:37.529 --> 20:40.240
And it was discovered
that he played the Baton

20:40.323 --> 20:42.867
a lot better than he
ever played the fiddle.

20:42.992 --> 20:47.205
And why he played the fiddle
so lousy in the first place.
