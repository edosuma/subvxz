WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:03.167
Tim, it's 45 minutes
to our dinner reservation.

00:03.168 --> 00:05.169
Aren't you gonna
take a shower?

00:05.170 --> 00:07.405
Honey, I don't need
to take a shower.

00:07.406 --> 00:10.108
I have a natural,
earthy, musky scent.

00:10.109 --> 00:11.643
Quit that.

00:11.644 --> 00:13.078
No, really. Stick your nose
right there

00:13.079 --> 00:15.513
And tell me I don't
smell like a man.

00:15.514 --> 00:17.415
Yeah, cro-magnon man.

00:17.416 --> 00:19.017
Arr. Arr-arr.

00:19.018 --> 00:22.053
And I believe he was never
fully erect, either.

00:22.054 --> 00:25.423
Ohh!

00:25.424 --> 00:27.993
Ready! Set! Hut-hut!

00:27.994 --> 00:30.595
Oh, shoot!

00:30.596 --> 00:34.198
Randy!
That's why your coach
doesn't let you play.

00:34.199 --> 00:37.201
Dad, I always fumble.
My hands are too small.

00:37.202 --> 00:40.471
I got the answer.
Up until now, you didn't
have the proper equipment.

00:40.472 --> 00:43.608
"wacky quacky glue"?

00:43.609 --> 00:45.777
Think of it
as professional stickum.

00:45.778 --> 00:47.178
But it says
on the bottle

00:47.179 --> 00:49.547
Not to let it
come in contact
with your skin.

00:49.548 --> 00:52.517
Oh, please. They mean
pretty little pink girl skin.

00:52.518 --> 00:56.688
We've got man skin -
calluses, warts, open wounds.

00:56.689 --> 01:00.491
Oh, yeah. A little dab
in each palm like that,

01:00.492 --> 01:04.394
A little bit of turpentine
to dilute it. Don't wanna
make it too sticky.

01:04.396 --> 01:08.499
And now... You won't be able
to drop that ball.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.568
Wow, that's cool, dad.

01:10.569 --> 01:12.637
All right.

01:12.638 --> 01:15.439
Let's go.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.142
Do you want us
to run a play?

01:17.143 --> 01:20.879
Um... I got a better idea.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.716
Why don't you guys
try to pull my arms apart?

01:24.717 --> 01:27.618
Your hands are stuck together,
aren't they?

01:27.619 --> 01:30.088
No. This is a strength exercise.

01:30.089 --> 01:33.892
You grab that arm,
randy, you grab that arm,
and try to pull 'em apart.

01:33.893 --> 01:36.227
1, 2, 3. Pull.

01:36.228 --> 01:38.396
Aah!

02:45.765 --> 02:48.066
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:51.403 --> 02:53.537
Jill? It's me.

02:53.538 --> 02:56.374
Come on in, karen.
I'm in.

02:56.375 --> 02:59.477
Gosh, I really appreciate
you giving up a Friday night
to stay with our kids.

02:59.478 --> 03:03.047
No problem. Your boys are
at least as mature as the men
I've been dating lately.

03:03.048 --> 03:06.484
<i>(chuckles)</i> tim, come on.
Karen's here. Let's go.

03:06.485 --> 03:09.254
Right, right, right.
We're almost done
with the drill, honey.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.355
Harder, harder.

03:11.356 --> 03:13.858
I see you're watching
tim's show.

03:13.859 --> 03:16.995
Yeah, this is this new thing
they're starting on the show
called "gadget corner."

03:16.996 --> 03:18.329
He wants me
to take a look at it.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.799
Oh, goody.
Here we go.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.869
<i>Place the jar under here,</i>
<i>grips the lid,</i>

03:24.870 --> 03:25.770
<i>With one easy twist...</i>

03:25.771 --> 03:28.239
Oh, that's cool.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.809
<i>Fascinating device, barbara.</i>
<i>Thank you for sharing it.</i>

03:30.810 --> 03:33.577
I like her hair.
Pretty color.

03:33.578 --> 03:36.681
Whoa! Look at that!
Did you see that?

03:36.682 --> 03:37.682
What?

03:37.683 --> 03:40.018
He was checking her out.
Look at this.

03:40.019 --> 03:42.386
Oh.

03:44.256 --> 03:45.690
<i>(karen laughs)</i>

03:45.691 --> 03:47.892
Tim.

03:47.893 --> 03:49.260
I gotta go get cleaned up.

03:49.261 --> 03:51.930
No, no, no. Come back. We're
watching "gadget corner."

03:51.931 --> 03:53.231
You guys like this segment?
Yeah.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.733
By the way, jill and I
thought the woman

03:55.734 --> 03:58.937
Who demonstrated the lid opener
was very attractive.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.306
Didn't you?
Attractive.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.041
I hardly even noticed
she was a woman.

04:03.042 --> 04:06.110
Hardly even noticed. Oh,
let's go to the videotape.

04:06.111 --> 04:07.378
Let's do.

04:09.915 --> 04:11.415
Watch closely, tim.

04:11.416 --> 04:12.917
<i>(al) we'll be looking at...</i>

04:12.918 --> 04:14.853
There!

04:16.088 --> 04:18.857
Looks like you're
noticing something.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.860
Wait a minute.
I wasn't looking at her.
I was looking past her.

04:21.861 --> 04:24.595
Yeah, right into her water bed.

04:24.596 --> 04:27.332
She was leaving,
just like you should be.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.000
I had to acknowledge her.

04:29.001 --> 04:32.971
Oh, well, ok, let's look at
that acknowledgment again,
shall we?

04:32.972 --> 04:34.739
Let's do, yeah.

04:34.740 --> 04:38.009
Do those legs
go all the way up?

04:38.010 --> 04:41.346
You know, this shot is not
supposed to be on me.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.181
It's supposed to be on al.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.850
Oh, so you only gawk at women
when jill's not around.

04:45.851 --> 04:48.619
Yes. No.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.721
I was looking at her,
but you know what I was
thinking the whole time?

04:50.722 --> 04:54.058
"she's stunning at 25,
but she's no jill."
oh.

04:54.059 --> 04:56.060
So I'm old and plain?

04:56.061 --> 04:58.930
You are far from plain.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.732
And old. Far from old.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.968
You're so far from old,
you're practically young.

05:03.969 --> 05:06.037
Any last requests, taylor?

05:06.038 --> 05:08.172
What is the big deal?
So I glanced at a woman.

05:08.173 --> 05:09.974
You're a married man, tim.

05:09.975 --> 05:13.211
A happily married man
and don't you ever forget it!

05:13.212 --> 05:16.514
Let's face it, jill. Tim is just
your typical american male.

05:16.515 --> 05:18.283
No self-control.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.751
Oh, please. I have
plenty of self-control.

05:20.752 --> 05:22.253
Hah!
Yeah, right.

05:22.254 --> 05:24.255
I say that you won't even make
it through this meal tonight

05:24.256 --> 05:25.924
Without checking
out the babes.

05:25.925 --> 05:29.760
He'll be lucky to make it past,
"taylor, table for two."

05:29.761 --> 05:33.264
Ok, ok. I'll prove it.

05:33.265 --> 05:37.768
I guarantee tonight I won't
be "checking out the babes."

05:37.769 --> 05:38.803
Uh-huh.

05:40.072 --> 05:42.373
We'll see who gets
the last laugh tonight.

05:54.686 --> 05:57.521
Excuse me, sir.

05:57.522 --> 05:59.490
Your table's back here.

05:59.491 --> 06:01.926
Thank you.
Thank you.

06:01.927 --> 06:03.861
Enjoy your meal.
We will, thanks.

06:06.898 --> 06:10.801
Tim, you've made your point.
You can at least look at me.

06:10.802 --> 06:15.206
Have I told you
how beautiful
you look tonight?

06:15.207 --> 06:17.275
Yeah, yeah, right.

06:17.276 --> 06:21.879
Excuse me. Aren't you, uh...?
Arr. Arr-arr.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.848
Yeah, oh-oh-oh.

06:23.849 --> 06:28.186
Boy, do I love you show.
Tell me something, though.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.789
That al, does he really
know more than you,

06:31.790 --> 06:34.658
Or is that just an act?

06:34.659 --> 06:36.361
That's just an act.

06:36.362 --> 06:39.464
Oh. It's a good one.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.266
Arr-arr-arr.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.735
<i>(grunting)</i> why
don't you go sit down
at your table, fella?

06:44.736 --> 06:45.836
Arr-arr-arr.

06:50.675 --> 06:53.077
I think you're really gonna
love indian food,

06:53.078 --> 06:56.514
And they got lamb curry,
chicken tandoori,

06:56.515 --> 07:00.584
And this keema korma
looks really good.

07:00.585 --> 07:04.055
Food smells like somebody
keema korma'd out in the alley.

07:06.025 --> 07:10.161
That's just that glue
you have on your hands.

07:10.162 --> 07:12.897
Didn't you get that stuff off?
Yeah, uh-huh.

07:21.206 --> 07:26.677
You know, I think that
glue's a little strong for
randy's football practice.

07:26.678 --> 07:29.247
Well, you know, tim,
I think it's great

07:29.248 --> 07:31.215
That you're working with randy
and everything,

07:31.216 --> 07:33.684
But don't you think you're
exerting a little too much
macho pressure on him?

07:33.685 --> 07:36.521
He likes football. I'm not
sure there's any way -

07:36.522 --> 07:38.689
You did it!
Did what?

07:38.690 --> 07:40.525
You looked at that woman.
I did not.

07:40.526 --> 07:43.861
Yes, you did. I mean,
it's no big deal,

07:43.862 --> 07:47.165
But I think you should know
that we've been here
less than one minute,

07:47.166 --> 07:49.733
And you have already
checked a woman out.

07:49.734 --> 07:53.404
I did not look at that woman,
and if I did, which I didn't,

07:53.405 --> 07:56.174
I'm a people person.
People walk by,
I'm gonna notice.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.477
Ok, people person,

07:59.478 --> 08:02.913
What did the man look like
that was with her?

08:02.914 --> 08:04.848
Man?

08:05.884 --> 08:09.820
Yeah. Men are people, too.

08:09.821 --> 08:11.622
Wait a minute. How'd you know
there was a man there?

08:11.623 --> 08:13.057
You were checking him out,
weren't you?

08:13.058 --> 08:16.961
No. They're sitting
right over there.

08:16.962 --> 08:18.496
You just did it again.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.531
I was looking at the man.

08:20.532 --> 08:21.899
Ok, what was he wearing?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.301
Wearing?

08:23.302 --> 08:25.970
A red dress.
No, wait a minute.

08:25.971 --> 08:28.806
She was wearing red,
he's wearing blue.

08:28.807 --> 08:30.874
Hey, tool man, arr-arr-arr.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.710
Arr-arr-arr.
Tim!

08:34.613 --> 08:36.847
You're gonna rupture
a vertebrae.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.649
Face it, you cannot
help yourself.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.552
You are so pathetic.

08:41.553 --> 08:44.855
Whoa, baby. Bad news.

08:48.327 --> 08:53.598
This is not the night for you
to give up looking at women.

08:53.599 --> 08:57.235
Uh-huh. Oh,
why is that, jill?

08:57.236 --> 09:00.871
Because an unbelievable
young goddess just came in

09:00.872 --> 09:02.440
And sat right behind you.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.475
Yeah, right. I'm gonna
fall into that one.

09:04.476 --> 09:06.544
What, a 74-year-old
steel worker?

09:06.545 --> 09:08.546
"hey, marge,
they got no beer here."

09:08.547 --> 09:09.780
Not exactly, tim.

09:09.781 --> 09:11.282
Oh, yeah, she's
the va-va-voom type?

09:11.283 --> 09:12.750
Well, as a matter of fact,

09:12.751 --> 09:16.887
She has great va-vas
and a darn good voom.

09:16.888 --> 09:18.556
It's all right with me because
you're lookin' pretty good

09:18.557 --> 09:21.392
Since you took
a couple pounds
off your voom.

09:21.393 --> 09:23.427
Well, thank you so much.

09:23.428 --> 09:24.828
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:24.829 --> 09:27.532
I'm going to take my voom
to the ladies' room.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.868
I'll be right here looking at
my menu and nothing else.

09:30.869 --> 09:35.673
Oh, man.
Off to the right, 3:00.
Unbelievable.

09:57.796 --> 10:00.231
Hey, it is you.

10:00.232 --> 10:03.801
Tim "the tool man" taylor.
I never miss your show.

10:03.802 --> 10:07.638
Oh, you have me confused with
that handsome guy on <i>tool time.</i>

10:07.639 --> 10:10.140
Don't be modest.
Could I get your autograph?

10:10.141 --> 10:12.543
Yeah. Quick, why don't you
slide it right under here

10:12.544 --> 10:14.545
Under my head here? Ok.

10:14.546 --> 10:17.948
Could you make it out
to kiki?
Kiki?

10:17.949 --> 10:21.319
K-I... Ohh.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.489
Ok, kikster, there you go.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.725
Could you put
my last name, too?

10:27.726 --> 10:29.493
You know, my wife
is due back. She's -

10:29.494 --> 10:31.795
Kiki von fursterwallenscheinlaw.

10:37.402 --> 10:38.636
What?

10:38.637 --> 10:40.771
F-u-r-s-t-e-r-

10:40.772 --> 10:43.107
W-a-l-l...
I'm getting a hand cramp.
Hold on.

10:43.108 --> 10:47.345
...E-n-s-c-h-e-I-n-l-a-w.

10:47.346 --> 10:51.782
L-a-w. Good thing
it didn't run out of ink.

10:51.783 --> 10:54.051
Now can you grunt for me?

10:54.052 --> 10:56.520
Well, you know, my wife
is coming back -

10:56.521 --> 10:58.922
Hello, honey.
Excuse me.

11:02.294 --> 11:04.061
<i>(grunts from choking)</i>

11:04.062 --> 11:06.997
<i>(all the men grunting)</i>

11:12.671 --> 11:14.472
What are you doing?

11:14.473 --> 11:16.741
Are you choking?

11:20.712 --> 11:22.647
<i>(grunting stops)</i>

11:31.356 --> 11:32.556
<i>(door closes)</i>

11:32.557 --> 11:34.057
Oh, upstairs, you guys.
Your parents are home.

11:34.058 --> 11:35.993
Quick, quick, quick.

11:37.729 --> 11:40.364
We're back.
Hi.

11:40.365 --> 11:41.899
Hi. How were the boys?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.834
Terrific. Been in bed
for hours.

11:43.835 --> 11:45.336
Yeah.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.604
How was dinner?

11:46.605 --> 11:50.040
It was great. Good food,
nice atmosphere,

11:50.041 --> 11:52.242
Excellent service,
tim almost choked to death.

11:52.243 --> 11:54.745
All in all, a splendid evening.

11:54.746 --> 11:57.080
I got a little piece of bread
caught in my throat.

11:57.081 --> 11:58.749
Yeah, he went into shock

11:58.750 --> 12:03.321
After staring at
bambi the land nymph.

12:05.390 --> 12:08.359
It was kiki
the land nymph.
Oh.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.428
Tim, I am stunned.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.130
You mean you couldn't control
that animal drive?

12:13.131 --> 12:14.998
Had nothing to do
with animal drive.

12:14.999 --> 12:17.000
The young lady
wanted an autograph.

12:17.001 --> 12:18.402
But you looked.

12:18.403 --> 12:20.638
All right, I looked,
but it didn't mean anything.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.673
It was like looking at
a beautiful car.

12:22.674 --> 12:25.509
Oh, so you're saying
women are cars?

12:25.510 --> 12:29.112
No. What I'm saying
is I appreciate beauty
in all of its forms,

12:29.113 --> 12:33.984
Like a sailboat
cruising across an open sea
with a full sail.

12:33.985 --> 12:39.256
Yeah, well, kiki certainly
had a full set of sails.

12:39.257 --> 12:44.528
According to tim's theory,
that would make you and I,
what, tugboats?

12:44.529 --> 12:46.330
You'd be a dingy.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.034
Thank you so much.

12:51.035 --> 12:55.506
Look, all I'm saying, tim,
is if I were married to you
and you looked at other women,

12:55.507 --> 12:58.175
I think it would
hurt my feelings.

12:58.176 --> 13:00.244
Karen...
What?

13:00.245 --> 13:03.046
I'm not married to you,

13:03.047 --> 13:06.684
And the real shocker,
I like hurting your feelings.

13:08.553 --> 13:10.388
Bye-bye, jill.

13:10.389 --> 13:13.023
Goodbye, karen.
Thanks for watching
the boys, karen.

13:13.024 --> 13:15.058
You're welcome.
I love you guys.

13:15.059 --> 13:17.027
Good night. Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.966
Tim.
Yeah.

13:22.967 --> 13:28.606
Are you happy
in this relationship?

13:28.607 --> 13:29.807
Yeah.

13:29.808 --> 13:33.878
Is there anything
that you would change?
No.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.747
So, you're completely satisfied?
Yeah, I'm
completely satisfied.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.751
It's my hair, isn't it?

13:40.752 --> 13:44.221
What?
You don't like the way
I changed my hair.

13:44.222 --> 13:48.225
I told you,
I love you hair.
No. I had to ask you first.

13:48.226 --> 13:50.260
Well, I love your hair.

13:50.261 --> 13:54.031
I love the way it smells,
no bald spot.

13:54.032 --> 13:56.467
Would you go over
and get those mugs for me?

13:56.468 --> 13:59.837
Honey.
So you're happy with
our relationship -

13:59.838 --> 14:01.839
I'm happy with
our relationship.
You're completely satisfied.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.974
I'm completely satisfied.
You love my hair.

14:03.975 --> 14:05.443
I absolutely love your hair.

14:05.444 --> 14:09.046
Then why were you looking
at other women tonight?

14:09.047 --> 14:10.614
Why was I looking at
other women tonight?

14:10.615 --> 14:11.982
Are you stalling?

14:11.983 --> 14:13.751
Am I stalling?

14:15.053 --> 14:17.688
Why do you look?

14:17.689 --> 14:20.057
There's a couple reasons.

14:20.058 --> 14:23.794
You have your primary reason
and your secondary reason.

14:23.795 --> 14:26.530
Primary reason first followed
by your secondary reason.
Tim,

14:26.531 --> 14:28.466
Why?

14:34.372 --> 14:36.640
Could you repeat that question?

14:39.945 --> 14:41.445
Hey, randy, what's going on?

14:41.446 --> 14:42.746
Nothin'.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.915
How'd your practice go today?

14:44.916 --> 14:48.519
I fumbled three times.

14:48.520 --> 14:54.191
Hey, buddy, had a bad day.
We all got bad days.

14:54.192 --> 14:55.693
Yeah, there's
a rumor going around

14:55.694 --> 14:58.829
They're gonna make me
cheerleader.

14:58.830 --> 15:02.432
Oh, no. If that happens,

15:02.433 --> 15:04.134
Make sure you get on
the top of that pyramid.

15:04.135 --> 15:06.637
You don't wanna be on
the bottom of that thing.

15:06.638 --> 15:08.305
Dad.

15:08.306 --> 15:10.574
All you gotta do
is work on your ball-handling
and your moves.

15:10.575 --> 15:14.277
I've worked on 'em
every day.

15:14.278 --> 15:16.480
Maybe I'm just too small
to be any good.

15:16.481 --> 15:18.482
No, you're not.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.618
What you need is
a training machine.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.553
Let me guess, you're
gonna build it, right?

15:22.554 --> 15:25.756
Man, sometimes you can
just read my mind.

15:25.757 --> 15:29.727
It'll be great.
Ropes, tackling dummies,
small explosions.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.730
If you can
survive it, you can be one of
the best players in michigan.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.498
Ok, when do we start?

15:36.134 --> 15:38.268
We could do it right now.

15:38.269 --> 15:41.438
Go get changed. I'll get
some tools out of the garage
and start building 'em.

15:41.439 --> 15:43.373
I'll be right there.

15:43.374 --> 15:45.576
<i>(radio plays)</i>

15:46.645 --> 15:48.178
Hey, wilson?

15:48.179 --> 15:50.113
Aloha, good neighbor.

15:51.182 --> 15:54.217
What's with that
cheesy music?

15:54.218 --> 15:55.986
I want to take a vacation,

15:55.987 --> 15:59.222
So I'm mentally projecting
myself to a place I'd like
to be.

15:59.223 --> 16:00.524
Hawaii?

16:00.525 --> 16:04.695
Oh, no, no, no. Tahiti.
Hawaii's too crowded.

16:04.696 --> 16:06.764
Do you mind if I interrupt
your vacation?

16:06.765 --> 16:08.365
Crack my coconut, tim.

16:10.769 --> 16:14.271
The other night, jill took me
to this restaurant...

16:14.272 --> 16:15.706
Mm-hmm.

16:15.707 --> 16:18.976
...And I was glancing
at these other women.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.979
Don't get me wrong. I love jill.
I'm crazy about her.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.948
She is a magnificent mate, tim.

16:23.949 --> 16:26.684
Yeah, I know. I really try
to respect women.

16:26.685 --> 16:31.021
I don't consciously
gawk at 'em. I do look.

16:31.022 --> 16:32.790
Is it a reflex or something?

16:32.791 --> 16:36.126
Well, tim, it goes back
a million years.

16:36.127 --> 16:39.630
In order for
the species to survive,

16:39.631 --> 16:43.133
Stone age man had to seek out
many different women.

16:43.134 --> 16:46.303
Kind of a ménage a flintstone.

16:46.304 --> 16:48.238
Mmm.

16:48.239 --> 16:52.375
You see, tim, there's
something very deep in your
collective unconscious.

16:52.376 --> 16:54.377
My collective unconscious.

16:54.378 --> 16:55.980
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.215
You still possess
ancient man's
primary fantasy -

16:58.216 --> 17:01.852
To seek out
many different women.

17:01.853 --> 17:03.453
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah,
oh, yeah, yeah.

17:05.455 --> 17:07.858
Jill doesn't
understand that.

17:07.858 --> 17:10.661
Probably because
a woman's primary fantasy
continues to be

17:10.662 --> 17:13.896
A meaningful relationship
with just one man.

17:13.897 --> 17:17.134
Yeah, but I look at women
because...

17:17.135 --> 17:19.803
Collectively,
I'm unconscious.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.744
In a manner
of speaking, tim.

17:27.746 --> 17:31.649
So it's in my nature
to look at women.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.117
That means it's ok.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.417
It's ok if you're
on the serengeti

17:34.418 --> 17:37.554
Chasing a wildebeest
with a club.

17:37.555 --> 17:40.490
But I was in a restaurant
in west bloomfield with my wife.

17:40.491 --> 17:42.826
Well, then, I'd call it
downright rude.

17:42.827 --> 17:45.763
Oh, oh, oh.

17:50.869 --> 17:53.737
Al, have I ever told you
what a great job you do
on the show?

17:53.738 --> 17:56.506
No, tim, you haven't.

17:56.507 --> 17:58.208
Huh. Well, anyway,

17:58.209 --> 18:00.811
We finished cutting
the holes in the top
part of the formica,

18:00.812 --> 18:04.281
And al's gonna install
the tubing and the faucet.

18:04.282 --> 18:06.717
Our faucet is... Hmm.

18:06.718 --> 18:09.486
Al, you suppose if an ancient
egyptian king owned this,

18:09.487 --> 18:12.756
It's be called
a pharaoh faucet?

18:14.525 --> 18:17.627
Only by you, tim.

18:17.628 --> 18:20.263
Of course, he'd be married
to ryan o'nile.

18:20.264 --> 18:22.800
Yeah, right. Ok.

18:22.801 --> 18:25.402
Al's measured our pipe
to the correct length,

18:25.403 --> 18:28.972
And I'll be cutting it
with my old, tubular,
trusty binford hacksaw.

18:28.973 --> 18:31.274
Gosh, I've had this thing
a long time.

18:31.275 --> 18:34.344
You get to take stuff
for granted after
a while, you know.

18:34.345 --> 18:36.279
Don't respect it
like you should.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.282
You know what
I'm getting at?
Not even close, tim.

18:39.283 --> 18:41.785
Well, I'm saying that
you could go out and buy -

18:41.786 --> 18:44.387
See, the new ones
are all shiny chrome

18:44.388 --> 18:46.389
And polyurethane handles
and everything,

18:46.390 --> 18:49.426
But you kind of forget
that old faithful one
you got back home.

18:49.427 --> 18:50.527
Little clearer now?

18:50.528 --> 18:52.629
Less than ever, tim.

18:54.532 --> 18:57.000
<i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>that old faithful saw</i>

18:57.001 --> 19:01.038
<i>That, um, you wouldn't give up</i>
<i>for anything in the world</i>

19:01.039 --> 19:04.875
<i>Because it's</i>
<i>a lifelong companion,</i>

19:04.876 --> 19:07.144
<i>Where every nick and cut</i>
<i>in that blade</i>

19:07.145 --> 19:11.481
<i>Is a memory of some</i>
<i>of the things you've</i>
<i>created together.</i>

19:11.482 --> 19:14.584
<i>It just fits. Hmm.</i>

19:14.585 --> 19:16.286
<i>Hmm.</i>

19:27.098 --> 19:29.466
<i>What is it, al? Fumes?</i>

19:29.467 --> 19:34.071
<i>No. I get your point now, tim.</i>

19:34.072 --> 19:35.873
<i>You respect me.</i>

19:35.874 --> 19:37.841
<i>Huh?</i>

19:37.842 --> 19:39.877
<i>You really respect me.</i>

19:43.148 --> 19:46.784
<i>We'll be right back</i>
<i>after these messages</i>
<i>from binford tools.</i>

19:46.785 --> 19:49.552
<i>It's ok, al.</i>
<i>Let go of me, al.</i>

19:49.553 --> 19:51.054
<i>(show theme plays/</i>
<i>turns off tv)</i>

19:52.924 --> 19:56.660
Well, ahem, that was
an interesting show.

19:56.661 --> 19:59.830
I particularly liked the part
about the saw.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.899
So you got
the meaning of it?

20:01.900 --> 20:04.334
Yeah.

20:04.335 --> 20:07.370
I know you were upset
at the restaurant
the other night.

20:07.371 --> 20:10.573
Well, you know,
it just bothered me

20:10.574 --> 20:12.375
That you couldn't go
more than one minute

20:12.376 --> 20:14.178
Without looking
at another woman.

20:14.179 --> 20:16.079
I think that
had a lot to do with

20:16.080 --> 20:18.315
You and karen
talking about that
all night.

20:18.316 --> 20:20.517
So if karen and I hadn't been
talking about it,

20:20.518 --> 20:22.786
You would've been able to go,
like, what, two minutes?

20:22.787 --> 20:25.355
Easy.

20:25.356 --> 20:30.928
I know it sounds stupid,
but sometimes when you look,

20:30.929 --> 20:33.263
It makes me feel
less appealing, you know,

20:33.264 --> 20:36.700
Like, um, I lost
a little something.

20:36.701 --> 20:37.835
Oh, you haven't
lost anything.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.036
You've gained.

20:43.474 --> 20:46.877
No, come on. Your best,
you're the best.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.246
I think you're beautiful.
You know that.

20:49.247 --> 20:53.383
The problem is I have
unconscious cave-man fantasies.

20:53.384 --> 20:54.684
What?

20:54.685 --> 20:58.989
I was talking to wilson,
and men have cave-man fantasies

20:58.990 --> 21:01.925
About being with
thousands of women at one time.

21:01.926 --> 21:03.360
Oh, really?

21:03.361 --> 21:06.696
You don't have that problem
because you have your fantasy.

21:10.634 --> 21:12.435
And what would that be?

21:12.436 --> 21:14.437
Me.
You?

21:14.438 --> 21:15.906
Yes.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.375
So, my fantasy
is to be with a man

21:18.376 --> 21:22.445
Approaching
middle-aged with a paunch
and a low-rated cable show?

21:23.748 --> 21:27.017
Right. Now, that's not
what I'd look for,

21:27.018 --> 21:29.920
But I'm not you.

21:29.921 --> 21:33.523
The truth is that what I did
was just downright rude.

21:33.524 --> 21:35.959
It'd be like burping in public.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.761
And you do that
all the time.

21:37.762 --> 21:40.797
But not with other women.

21:40.798 --> 21:42.933
I save my best burps for you.

21:42.934 --> 21:46.036
Oh, thank you so much.

21:49.774 --> 21:52.442
Well, honey,
what do you think?

21:52.443 --> 21:56.613
Silly me.
I wanted a pool.
Oh.

21:56.614 --> 21:58.548
Hey, dad, can I
turn this on?
Don't turn it on.

21:58.549 --> 22:00.817
Jill, get out of the way.
Gimme the ball. Come on.

22:00.818 --> 22:02.519
Mark, come here.
All right, randy,

22:02.520 --> 22:04.454
Pay close attention
to this drill.

22:06.357 --> 22:09.826
This will give you
proof positive

22:09.827 --> 22:12.762
That skill and speed

22:12.763 --> 22:15.865
Are more important
than size.

22:15.866 --> 22:19.970
We're talking agility.
Ball.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.472
Arr-arr-arr-arr.

22:22.473 --> 22:25.475
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.

22:25.476 --> 22:27.877
I'm impressed.
Way to go, dad.

22:27.878 --> 22:29.679
Now the fun begins.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.815
Brad, top three switches -
flip 'em.

22:31.816 --> 22:34.851
Like this?

22:34.852 --> 22:37.687
<i>(jill)</i> cool.
<i>(mark)</i> yeah.

22:39.023 --> 22:41.524
<i>(mark)</i> whoa.
Slow 'em down
a little bit.

22:41.525 --> 22:43.693
I can't. It's stuck.

22:43.694 --> 22:45.295
It's stuck.

22:45.296 --> 22:47.297
<i>(mark)</i> yeah,
knock his head off.

22:47.298 --> 22:48.898
<i>(brad)</i> come on, dad!

22:48.899 --> 22:50.834
<i>(jill)</i> ha-ha-ha. All right!

22:50.835 --> 22:54.404
Is this the switch
for the other dummy?

22:58.676 --> 23:00.710
Aloha, tim.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.682
<i>(jill)</i> a little fast, isn't it?
Slow this one down, brad.

23:05.683 --> 23:07.250
I can't. It's stuck.

23:07.251 --> 23:09.252
Well, you can do it.
Come on, tim.

23:09.253 --> 23:11.654
<i>(mark)</i> knock his head off.
Knock his head off.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.957
<i>(jill chuckles)</i> come on.

23:13.958 --> 23:15.959
<i>(brad)</i> oh, come on.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.160
<i>(all cheer)</i>

23:17.161 --> 23:20.163
What's this switch?
<i>(jill)</i> whoa.
