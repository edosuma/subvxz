00:02.616 --> 00:04.049
Well, let's not jump
to conclusions.

00:05.585 --> 00:06.916
The A-Team?

00:06.987 --> 00:08.284
You're gonna
help us catch 'em.

00:08.355 --> 00:10.687
Bounty hunters.
They want to collect
on all of us.

00:10.757 --> 00:12.418
l don't think
we have to worry about them.

00:12.492 --> 00:13.618
[siren wailing]

00:13.693 --> 00:15.184
Peck?
Decker.

00:16.396 --> 00:18.421
l have a gun on you.
Put your hands up.

00:18.498 --> 00:20.159
l'm all right, but l--

00:20.233 --> 00:22.394
You wanna see this
sweet little thing again...

00:22.469 --> 00:24.596
you better hope Smith does
what l tell him.

00:24.805 --> 00:26.363
They don't look
too tough to me.

00:26.673 --> 00:28.800
The game isn't over till
the last hand is dealt.

00:33.313 --> 00:35.679
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:35.749 --> 00:37.444
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:37.551 --> 00:39.109
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.186 --> 00:40.380
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.454 --> 00:42.115
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.189 --> 00:43.520
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:43.590 --> 00:45.285
Today,
still wanted
by the government...

00:45.359 --> 00:47.384
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:47.461 --> 00:49.656
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:49.730 --> 00:51.254
and if you can find them...

00:51.331 --> 00:53.322
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

[elevator bell dinging]

02:26.259 --> 02:28.159
Hey, there,
pretty lady.

02:28.695 --> 02:31.493
We're lookin' for a fella
by the name of Murdock.

02:31.832 --> 02:33.322
Are you friends
of Murdock?

02:33.400 --> 02:34.628
Friends?

02:34.734 --> 02:37.862
Well, yes, ma'am,
we're real good buddies
of Mr. Murdock's.

02:37.938 --> 02:39.633
Mr. Murdock's
in room 104.

02:39.706 --> 02:42.004
lt's down the hall
and on your right.

02:42.075 --> 02:43.235
Much obliged.

02:44.711 --> 02:46.645
[video game beeping]

02:48.949 --> 02:51.543
l guess he don't wanna
be disturbed, huh, Royko?

02:56.223 --> 02:58.248
(Tanen)
All right, let's go!

02:58.325 --> 03:01.692
Why did you just blow a hole
through my door?

03:01.761 --> 03:02.853
Shut the hell up.

03:02.929 --> 03:04.760
(Royko)
l'm gonna tell you this
just once, flyboy.

03:04.831 --> 03:06.594
Keep your mouth shut
and do what you're told...

03:06.666 --> 03:08.861
or they'll be pickin' you
off the walls. Got it?

03:12.639 --> 03:13.663
[gun firing]

03:13.740 --> 03:15.332
[woman screaming]
Everyone hit the floor now!

03:15.408 --> 03:16.432
[elevator bell dinging]

03:16.510 --> 03:17.772
Come on!

03:18.545 --> 03:19.534
Get!

03:26.987 --> 03:28.318
(Face)
What happened here?

03:28.388 --> 03:30.788
lt was horrible.
There was nothing
we could do.

03:30.857 --> 03:33.417
lt was frightening,
really frightening.

03:33.493 --> 03:35.358
l thought we were all
gonna be killed.

03:35.428 --> 03:38.226
Oh, well, now,
just calm down.
Just relax.

03:38.298 --> 03:42.166
Really, you've been
very, very good
through this.

03:42.235 --> 03:44.931
Yeah, tell me,
what exactly have you
told the police?

03:45.005 --> 03:47.496
l mean, what did
the men look like?

03:47.574 --> 03:49.667
They were just
two big guys.

03:50.043 --> 03:51.635
They talked
like hillbillies.

03:53.246 --> 03:55.612
l've called the military.
They're on their way.

03:55.682 --> 03:58.310
You called the military?

03:58.418 --> 04:01.581
Well, l'm sure
the police want to ask you
some more questions...

04:01.655 --> 04:04.556
but, really,
l must be going.
lt, uh....

04:04.624 --> 04:06.285
[clearing throat]

04:09.062 --> 04:10.529
[elevator bell dinging]

04:12.966 --> 04:13.955
Peck?

04:14.034 --> 04:15.023
Decker.

04:15.268 --> 04:16.428
Peck.

04:18.038 --> 04:19.197
After him.

04:32.452 --> 04:34.579
Peck must still be in here.
Let's go.

04:44.731 --> 04:45.755
[grunting]

04:46.232 --> 04:47.563
[exclaiming]
Thanks.

04:51.638 --> 04:54.607
l'm telling you, Hannibal,
they tore
the whole floor apart.

04:54.674 --> 04:56.335
Scared everyone on duty
half to death.

04:56.409 --> 04:58.468
These guys who took Murdock,
man, they got shotguns.

04:58.545 --> 05:01.378
Who knows what
they'll do to him?
We gotta go after 'em now.

05:01.448 --> 05:03.746
Yeah, but which way?
We haven't got a direction.

05:04.084 --> 05:06.746
Yeah, you think this is
Decker's way
of drawing us out?

05:06.820 --> 05:09.414
Nah. Two hillbillies
with shotguns,
that's not Decker's style.

05:09.489 --> 05:11.514
What are we
gonna do, Hannibal?
They might kill him.

05:11.591 --> 05:14.355
lf they're gonna kill him,
they would have done it
at the hospital.

05:14.427 --> 05:15.985
l got a feeling
they want him alive.

05:16.062 --> 05:18.189
Yeah, they'll probably try
to make contact with us.

05:18.264 --> 05:20.926
Yeah, but the only number
that Murdock knows...

05:21.001 --> 05:22.263
is the mobile phone
in the van.

05:22.335 --> 05:23.666
[thumping on van]
Uh-oh, let's go.

05:23.737 --> 05:25.762
Okay, Smith,
we got this shot set up.

05:25.839 --> 05:27.830
We're waiting for you.
Come on.

05:27.907 --> 05:31.206
Okay, the scene is where
you grab the girl and drag her
back to the nest...

05:31.277 --> 05:32.608
where the eucalyptus tree is.

05:32.679 --> 05:33.805
What?
Here.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.313
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

05:35.382 --> 05:37.009
l think it'll fit,
but the pants leak.

05:37.083 --> 05:39.881
Wait a minute.
We gotta set up this shot.
You can't go off like this.

05:39.953 --> 05:42.547
Kid, kid, kid, kid.
Put him on report...

05:43.390 --> 05:44.379
again.

05:44.991 --> 05:45.980
But....

05:46.092 --> 05:48.151
(Murdock)
All l asked you
was how much further it is.

05:48.228 --> 05:50.753
You haven't stopped
since we left the hospital.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.127
We're goin' out of state,
aren't we?

05:52.198 --> 05:53.529
l mean, this is gonna
be a long drive.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.329
l hate long drives.
l get so nauseated.

05:55.502 --> 05:57.800
Can't we turn on
the flow-through ventilation
or something?

05:57.871 --> 05:59.896
And look, why don't you watch
the speed limit there?

05:59.973 --> 06:01.304
You're not even wearin'
your seatbelts!

06:01.374 --> 06:02.864
Why aren't you
wearin' your seatbelts?

06:02.942 --> 06:04.102
You better stop, man!

06:04.177 --> 06:06.771
Been goin' on
for two hours.
What are you, crazy?

06:06.846 --> 06:07.904
Of course l'm crazy.

06:07.981 --> 06:10.541
You got me out
of the psychiatric ward
of a VA hospital, stupid!

06:10.617 --> 06:13.211
Hey! You know
what l do to guys
that don't shut up?

06:13.319 --> 06:15.810
l take me some piano wire
and sew their lips together.

06:15.889 --> 06:16.981
That would hurt.

06:17.057 --> 06:19.525
Yeah, it don't take
but a minute.
Think about that.

06:32.872 --> 06:35.340
(Murdock)
My jacket didn't have wrinkles
in it before l got in that.

06:35.408 --> 06:37.137
Look at my ply shoes.
They're all scuffed up.

06:37.210 --> 06:38.609
l know l'm gonna have to
get 'em cleaned.

06:38.678 --> 06:40.873
ls there a Laundromat
around here?
l know l saw a Laundromat.

06:40.947 --> 06:43.677
Another thing, l'm gonna
need some change, 'cause
l only got a quarter...

06:43.750 --> 06:45.741
and l know it's gonna be
at least 35 cents
for a fluff-dry.

06:45.819 --> 06:47.844
And l'm hungry.
You didn't offer me
any burgers or fries.

06:47.921 --> 06:49.650
[all yelling]

06:49.723 --> 06:50.781
What are you
talkin' about?

06:50.857 --> 06:52.154
He's drivin' me nuts!

06:52.225 --> 06:54.193
[Tanen shouting]
Tanen, stop it!

06:54.260 --> 06:55.625
l've never seen
anything like this.

06:55.695 --> 06:56.684
That's enough.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.854
You boys settle down.

06:59.699 --> 07:00.688
[laughing]

07:00.767 --> 07:02.132
Them's my two boys.

07:02.535 --> 07:04.901
They get real
excitable sometimes.

07:05.472 --> 07:07.372
So you're Murdock, huh?

07:07.440 --> 07:08.771
l sure heard
a lot about you.

07:08.842 --> 07:11.675
You heard about me?
l don't know about me.
What do you know about me?

07:11.745 --> 07:14.441
Well, two tours in Nam...

07:14.514 --> 07:17.142
Silver Star,
three Unit Citations...

07:17.217 --> 07:20.778
wounded twice, best damn
Huey chopper pilot we had.

07:21.888 --> 07:24.789
l don't mean to be pushy,
but what am l doing here?

07:24.858 --> 07:28.794
You see, me and my two boys
and the lndian here...

07:28.862 --> 07:29.954
we're bounty hunters.

07:30.029 --> 07:32.054
Yeah, best there is.

07:32.132 --> 07:34.157
And there's three men
out there someplace.

07:34.234 --> 07:36.134
They calls theirselves
the A-Team.

07:36.603 --> 07:39.128
Now, the army's offerin' up
a big reward on 'em.

07:39.205 --> 07:40.433
Dead or alive.

07:40.807 --> 07:42.138
The A-Team?

07:42.208 --> 07:44.108
Yeah. And you're
gonna help us catch 'em.

07:44.344 --> 07:45.470
Get him in the house.

07:45.545 --> 07:48.571
Catch what? The A-Team?
l don't know
what you're talkin' about.

07:48.648 --> 07:50.206
Bounty hunters,
A-Team...

07:50.283 --> 07:52.308
bounty hunters,
this A-Team.

07:52.385 --> 07:53.977
l don't know
what you're talkin' about.

07:54.053 --> 07:55.680
(Murdock)
l'm just a guy
from a mental ward.

07:55.755 --> 07:56.813
Tie him up.

07:58.558 --> 08:00.025
You know,
you look Chippewa.

08:00.226 --> 08:01.250
You Chippewa?

08:01.661 --> 08:03.822
(Murdock)
No, you're not Chippewa.
You're Chumash, Chumash.

08:03.930 --> 08:05.989
(Murdock)
No, with Chumash,
they roam California.

08:06.065 --> 08:08.033
No, you ain't Chumash,
you're Cheyenne.
You Cheyenne?

08:08.101 --> 08:09.466
Does he always
just stare like that?

08:09.536 --> 08:11.697
The lndian?
Yeah, when he's mad.

08:12.572 --> 08:15.040
(Royko)
Man, we're gonna do it. We're
gonna take on the A-Team.

08:15.108 --> 08:17.303
(Darrow)
We're gonna do it
when l say we're gonna do it.

08:17.377 --> 08:20.346
l been collectin'
on bounties
for 35 years now...

08:20.413 --> 08:22.074
and l know
what l'm doin'.

08:22.148 --> 08:25.845
And this A-Team bounty
is the one l've been
waitin' for all my life.

08:25.919 --> 08:28.046
And l aim to see that
everything goes just right.

08:28.121 --> 08:29.588
We'll get' em, Daddy.
Don't you worry.

08:29.656 --> 08:30.918
Well, we'd better get 'em.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.958
And now you're gonna put in
a call to your friends...

08:38.498 --> 08:41.956
'cause l expect
they're real concerned
about you right about now.

08:45.538 --> 08:46.903
[telephone ringing]

08:47.874 --> 08:48.932
Yeah.

08:49.008 --> 08:52.409
Colonel, there's somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

08:54.180 --> 08:55.169
Yeah.

08:55.782 --> 08:57.545
We got your man here, Smith.

08:57.617 --> 08:59.847
(Darrow)
I hear you and your boys
are pretty tough.

08:59.919 --> 09:01.113
Why do you
want Murdock?

09:01.187 --> 09:03.212
Well, it ain't
Murdock we want.

09:03.289 --> 09:05.086
lt's the three of you
we're after.

09:05.158 --> 09:08.218
(Darrow)
The military's offerin' up
a big bounty on you...

09:08.361 --> 09:09.828
and I aim to collect on it.

09:10.263 --> 09:12.322
Now, if you wanna
see Murdock again...

09:12.799 --> 09:15.563
you and Peck and Baracus
will come to me.

09:16.469 --> 09:18.869
Now, take this down.
l'm only gonna say it once.

09:19.239 --> 09:21.298
(Darrow)
Go on out of town
on Route 9...

09:21.374 --> 09:23.035
up to Bedford Falls.

09:23.409 --> 09:25.934
When you get there,
there's a bar called
The Hat Rack...

09:26.012 --> 09:28.742
there's a pay phone
in the back of that bar.

09:29.148 --> 09:31.139
You go there
and wait for my call.

09:31.217 --> 09:34.653
And remember,
there'll be somebody
watching you every second...

09:34.721 --> 09:36.621
from the minute
you get into town.

09:36.689 --> 09:38.782
Now, if you don't answer
when I call...

09:38.858 --> 09:39.847
[telephone ringing]

09:39.926 --> 09:42.486
your buddy Murdock here
is dead meat.

09:48.568 --> 09:49.557
Yeah.

09:49.636 --> 09:51.228
(Darrow)
Well, now. Howdy, partner.

09:51.671 --> 09:53.502
l'm glad you could make it.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.107
l was just about to hang up...

09:55.174 --> 09:58.769
and that'd have made
your buddy Murdock here
feel right poorly.

09:58.845 --> 10:00.107
Yeah, well...

10:00.179 --> 10:01.373
[panting]

10:01.447 --> 10:02.436
l'm here.

10:02.949 --> 10:04.075
Now, what do you want?

10:04.150 --> 10:06.277
Now you're gonna
take the road out of town,
that's what.

10:06.352 --> 10:09.344
You go on along the road
until you come
to Pinecrest Drive.

10:10.023 --> 10:11.149
(Darrow)
You take a right.

10:11.224 --> 10:14.022
You follow that along
until you come
to the junction.

10:14.093 --> 10:17.654
You take a left fork,
then go on till you find
an abandoned campsite.

10:18.131 --> 10:19.655
There, you're gonna stop...

10:20.566 --> 10:22.534
and you're all gonna
take off your jackets.

10:22.869 --> 10:26.737
And then you're gonna
get out of the van
with your hands in the air.

10:27.006 --> 10:29.804
Now, if l see any of you
guys packin' somethin'...

10:30.576 --> 10:33.044
l'm gonna gut shoot
everyone of you.

10:33.813 --> 10:35.280
[dial tone sounding]

10:36.582 --> 10:39.380
[people chattering]

10:41.421 --> 10:44.754
[dishes clattering]

10:47.126 --> 10:48.115
[door chime ringing]

10:48.194 --> 10:49.183
[door closing]

10:49.729 --> 10:51.697
[engine starting]

10:54.367 --> 10:55.425
Hey, they just left.

a few cars backed up.

the problem?

to go on?

we got so far
is some hiker reported...

into the back of a blue van
down Junction 16.

a license number or
a description of the driver.

a lot of good luck, officer.

37:50.114 --> 37:52.139
(Face)
Murdock, we're gonna
pull this one out.

37:52.216 --> 37:53.513
Yeah, have faith, brother.

37:53.851 --> 37:56.046
All right, Colonel,
we're gonna need a diversion.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.748
Yeah, except those guys
gonna be expecting us
to try something.

37:58.823 --> 38:01.053
Then let's not
disappoint 'em.

38:14.639 --> 38:16.163
We gotta do this
fast, guys.

38:46.738 --> 38:48.137
[whirring]

40:40.685 --> 40:42.380
l'm tellin' you,
they're not gonna show.

40:42.887 --> 40:44.787
They got 10 minutes.
They'll be here.

40:45.456 --> 40:46.480
[chuckling]

40:46.557 --> 40:48.252
l kinda hope
they don't show.

40:48.326 --> 40:50.988
That way me
and sweetie-pie here
can get better acquainted.

40:51.529 --> 40:54.760
l'm tired of tellin' you
about keepin' your mind
on your job.

40:54.832 --> 40:56.527
Come on, Pa.
We got what we wanted.

40:56.601 --> 40:59.092
The A-Team's on its way.
Let me have a little fun.

40:59.270 --> 41:01.966
Pappy's right.
Now, don't mess things up.

41:03.241 --> 41:05.709
That bounty's plenty big,
even split four ways.

41:05.977 --> 41:08.275
After we're finished,
you can buy
all the fun you want.

41:08.346 --> 41:10.541
You mind your business,
l'll take care of mine.

41:10.615 --> 41:11.604
Listen.

41:12.216 --> 41:14.241
Let's worry about
the good times later.

41:14.786 --> 41:16.981
Now, you get out in the yard
and keep an eye out.

41:20.591 --> 41:21.580
[door opening]

41:28.633 --> 41:29.622
They're here!

41:47.618 --> 41:48.676
[doors closing]

41:50.688 --> 41:53.213
Okay, we're here.
Why don't you
let the girl go?

41:53.291 --> 41:54.280
Sure.

41:57.829 --> 41:59.126
You okay?
Yeah.

41:59.564 --> 42:01.623
l've been waitin'
a real long time...

42:01.699 --> 42:04.293
to have the A-Team
standin' there
in front of me.

42:04.368 --> 42:06.029
They don't look
too tough to me.

42:06.103 --> 42:08.128
Why don't you tell
sap-mouth over there...

42:08.206 --> 42:10.538
that the game isn't over
till the last hand is dealt.

42:10.608 --> 42:12.041
Hey, you're right.

42:12.376 --> 42:13.843
Only this time, you lose.

42:14.078 --> 42:15.170
(Darrow)
All right, take them out!

42:15.279 --> 42:16.268
[exploding]

42:17.882 --> 42:19.509
[guns firing]

42:34.265 --> 42:35.789
[grunting]

42:42.306 --> 42:43.295
[grunting]

42:45.109 --> 42:46.633
[both grunting]

43:03.094 --> 43:04.561
[both grunting]

43:26.617 --> 43:27.879
They never learn.

43:28.953 --> 43:30.716
''You gotta know
when to hold 'em...

43:31.188 --> 43:32.883
and know when to walk away.''

43:33.424 --> 43:34.448
[sirens wailing]

43:34.525 --> 43:36.288
Hey, man, Decker!

43:38.329 --> 43:39.728
Give Col. Decker
our regards...

43:39.797 --> 43:42.459
and ask him
to throw these slimeballs
in jail for us, would you?

43:45.403 --> 43:46.700
l gotta go.

44:08.125 --> 44:09.592
Murdock,
you have a visitor.

44:10.061 --> 44:11.289
Visitor?

44:12.563 --> 44:13.996
Do me a favor,
will you?

44:14.065 --> 44:16.192
Will you go find out
if it's a bill collector?

44:16.267 --> 44:18.064
lf it is,
just tell him....

44:18.135 --> 44:20.296
Just tell him
l ran out of stamps
a couple of months ago.

44:20.371 --> 44:22.703
He'll understand,
he really will.
They're very good about it.

44:22.773 --> 44:24.866
lt's not
a bill collector.
lt's a lady.

44:25.109 --> 44:26.906
A lady?
Where is she?

44:27.078 --> 44:28.568
She's waiting
right over here.

44:29.113 --> 44:30.512
Thank you.

44:30.748 --> 44:31.976
Thank you.

44:37.254 --> 44:39.051
Well, you said
l could come visit you.

44:41.892 --> 44:43.860
What? What's the matter?

44:43.928 --> 44:45.953
Nothin'. Nothin'.

44:47.932 --> 44:49.866
l'm just comparing you
to a mental image...

44:49.934 --> 44:51.265
l was carryin' around
in my head...

44:51.335 --> 44:52.768
sort of like a....

44:52.837 --> 44:54.099
A mind projection.

44:54.171 --> 44:55.195
And guess what.

44:55.272 --> 44:56.261
What?

44:56.374 --> 44:58.365
lt doesn't compare
to the real thing.

44:59.343 --> 45:00.640
l've missed you.

45:01.612 --> 45:02.909
l missed you, too.

45:04.815 --> 45:06.544
Well, you never called.

45:06.884 --> 45:10.650
Well, you know,
they don't give you
any dimes in this place.

45:10.721 --> 45:13.588
l think they're afraid
you're gonna choke on 'em.
Know what l mean?

45:14.425 --> 45:16.086
Murdock, what are you
doing here?

45:16.560 --> 45:17.959
That's a long story.

45:18.429 --> 45:20.522
Well, you wanna tell me
over a pizza?

45:20.598 --> 45:23.123
Pizza? Has it got pepperoni
and mushroom on it?

45:23.200 --> 45:26.169
Well, it's got pepperoni,
but we'll have to do
without the mushrooms.

45:29.640 --> 45:30.937
[exclaiming]

45:31.008 --> 45:32.475
You already took a bite.
