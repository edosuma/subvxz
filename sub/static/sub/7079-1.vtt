Welcome back to Greendale,

00:06.915 --> 00:12.959
now ranking fifth on Colorado's
alphabetical listing of community colleges.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.248
Rest in peace, Bad Boy Slim's DJ School.

00:16.250 --> 00:20.709
This school owes its continued
existence to the following heroes.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.499
Jeff Winger, a teacher so

00:22.500 --> 00:27.679
dedicated to clean energy, he's already
parking like his car is electric.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.573
Britta Perry, currently raising
awareness of homelessness,

00:31.574 --> 00:33.166
not that she has a choice.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.915
Abed Nadir, who actually wrote
this announcement for the sake of,

00:36.916 --> 00:38.967
as he put it, catching everyone up.

00:38.968 --> 00:43.167
And Annie Edison who led the effort to save

00:43.168 --> 00:47.977
Greendale from 534 critical emergencies.

00:47.978 --> 00:49.718
534?

02:38.042 --> 02:39.911
I can't believe the roof collapsed.

02:39.912 --> 02:41.339
We almost killed Fat Neil.

02:41.340 --> 02:42.128
That was Garrett.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.742
See, we're monsters.

02:43.743 --> 02:45.886
Okay, if they blame us for
this, let me take the heat.

02:45.887 --> 02:48.057
I'd never see the inside of a cell.

02:48.058 --> 02:53.560
I have been reliving this day over
and over for a thousand years.

02:53.561 --> 02:54.681
Guys, this is not on us.

02:54.682 --> 02:58.756
That roof was gonna collapse, 80%
of the rubble was styrofoam.

02:58.757 --> 03:01.403
Speaking of guilt, where's Shirley?

03:01.404 --> 03:02.773
You didn't tell him?

03:02.774 --> 03:04.480
I was waiting until we were all together.

03:04.481 --> 03:07.144
Abed's not comfortable with C-H-A-N-G-E.

03:07.145 --> 03:07.806
Hey, screw you.

03:07.807 --> 03:09.641
I can spell.

03:09.642 --> 03:11.533
Screw you.

03:11.534 --> 03:12.288
Is Shirley gone?

03:12.289 --> 03:13.193
Did she spin off?

03:13.194 --> 03:15.991
Nobody spins off in real life, Abed.

03:15.992 --> 03:19.284
Shirley went to look after her dad
in Atlanta and ended up taking

03:19.285 --> 03:23.213
a job as a personal chef to a brilliant,
but troubled Southern detective.

03:23.214 --> 03:25.674
I told her I'd manage her
sandwich shop while she's gone.

03:25.675 --> 03:27.009
Oh, that's very generous of you.

03:27.010 --> 03:29.926
I have a friend in town, every time
you're gonna need help with that.

03:29.927 --> 03:31.006
She'll be back.

03:31.007 --> 03:32.139
[LAUGH]. Like Troy?

03:32.140 --> 03:35.681
Are any of you white people noticing
what's happening to this group?

03:35.682 --> 03:37.643
Do Abed and I need to be concerned?

03:37.644 --> 03:41.231
You have my word, as leader of the white
people there's no cause for alarm.

03:41.232 --> 03:44.110
Say hello to new Shirley.

03:44.111 --> 03:45.399
[LAUGH] Just kidding.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.233
This is Francesca Dart.

03:47.234 --> 03:49.904
I have brought her on as an
administrative consultant.

03:49.905 --> 03:52.906
I thought it would be
fun, and mandatory for

03:52.907 --> 03:55.407
you to add her to your little committee.

03:55.408 --> 03:57.398
Why, because one roof collapsed?

03:57.399 --> 03:59.461
No, God, God no.

03:59.462 --> 04:02.327
I'm your friend bringing you a new friend,

04:02.328 --> 04:05.196
one with training in not collapsing roofs.

04:05.197 --> 04:07.251
Is she, excuse me, ma'am.

04:07.252 --> 04:11.465
Is she above us or below us?

04:11.466 --> 04:13.056
She is, woop!

04:13.057 --> 04:17.584
[LAUGH] I'm getting a call,
here, and I'll have to take it.

04:17.584 --> 04:20.951
Frankie, why don't you explain
what your role will be,

04:20.952 --> 04:22.855
while I leave to take this call.

04:22.856 --> 04:27.344
My phone is vibrating, but it is In
your office, which you didn't realize,

04:27.345 --> 04:29.147
when you started the fake phone call move.

04:29.148 --> 04:31.992
My phone is in my pocket, Jeffrey.

04:31.993 --> 04:32.653
Mm.

04:32.654 --> 04:36.241
I'm walking away, so I can
get it out and answer it.

04:36.242 --> 04:38.830
Let me know how it goes.

04:38.831 --> 04:40.583
Okay, I'll just have a seat and-.

04:40.584 --> 04:41.292
No!

04:41.293 --> 04:43.126
No! No, no, no! Hey!

04:43.127 --> 04:44.786
Our friend use to sit there.

04:44.787 --> 04:46.957
She spun off.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.384
I'm sorry, what about here?

04:49.385 --> 04:51.735
Yeah, [CROSSTALK], I guess that's okay.

04:51.736 --> 04:52.681
Okay, so,

04:52.682 --> 04:58.283
I took an informal survey to get a
sense of how Greendale is perceived.

04:58.284 --> 05:01.440
And three themes emerged, weird.

05:01.441 --> 05:03.553
Passionate and gross.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.683
Now you want to hang onto that grouping.

05:05.684 --> 05:09.599
In marketing, it's what
we call the Good Belushi.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.889
If I had a magic wand,

05:10.890 --> 05:13.689
I would use it to make sure
Greendale never had to grow up.

05:13.690 --> 05:17.839
I would also probably use it to cut the
Magic Wand class that I noticed is

05:17.840 --> 05:22.999
actually offered here, as well as VCR
Repair, a class called Ladders, and

05:23.000 --> 05:24.659
When is it Okay to Shake a Baby?

05:24.660 --> 05:28.359
In terms of hierarchy, I'm
a big believer in it.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.929
Someone needs to say, I'm in
charge, and that person is me.

05:31.930 --> 05:32.939
That's my decision.

05:32.940 --> 05:37.579
That doesn't mean that we don't work
together, but all communication and

05:37.580 --> 05:39.589
decisions will go through me.

05:39.590 --> 05:43.019
I'll send out an email later
to set up our next meeting.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.049
Awesome. Okay. Great seeing you, Professor.

05:45.050 --> 05:46.411
Yeah. Coolios.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.129
Who in the crazy bitch?

05:48.130 --> 05:49.012
Did that just happen?

05:49.013 --> 05:50.474
Did you see her binder?

05:50.475 --> 05:53.509
[LAUGH] Pretty nondescript.

05:53.510 --> 05:54.669
Seems like she may be trouble.

05:54.670 --> 05:55.339
To be fair,

05:55.340 --> 05:59.899
she's an additional white person, which
has clearly become important here.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.034
No, thank you.

06:01.035 --> 06:03.799
I, I'm just glad I was able to answer.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.909
My, my phone got lodged in my pocket.

06:05.910 --> 06:07.189
I know!

06:07.190 --> 06:09.119
I guess that is a thing.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.763
So, you were saying about the thing,
the reason you were calling was,

06:12.764 --> 06:14.537
what were you talking to me about?

06:14.538 --> 06:15.791
[MUSIC]

06:15.792 --> 06:17.254
Looks good, Tony.

06:17.255 --> 06:20.179
I'm sorry, I just assume your name is Tony.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.271
Here you go.

06:21.272 --> 06:27.087
I gave you some extra heat.

06:27.088 --> 06:30.431
Britta, what is the weekly
cost of this restaurant?

06:30.432 --> 06:31.197
Oh, that's easy.

06:31.198 --> 06:32.172
My dignity.

06:32.173 --> 06:37.375
Seems like this sandwich counter
is consuming your happiness and

06:37.376 --> 06:40.694
converting it into burnt bread and debt.

06:40.695 --> 06:41.901
So?

06:41.902 --> 06:42.986
Frankie, hi.

06:42.987 --> 06:47.102
Someone removed all the liquor
from the faculty lounge.

06:47.103 --> 06:49.960
I'm sorry, I cannot legally protect or

06:49.961 --> 06:52.909
insure a campus with free flowing booze.

06:52.910 --> 06:56.179
Well, I can't teach with
free flowing sobriety.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.375
Is that true?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.813
Do you really think you're an addict?

07:00.814 --> 07:05.085
No.

07:05.086 --> 07:08.591
Dean!

07:08.592 --> 07:09.404
Hello?

07:09.405 --> 07:10.332
Oh, oh, hey!

07:10.333 --> 07:11.145
Yes, I can talk.

07:11.146 --> 07:12.120
Damn it.

07:12.121 --> 07:13.838
I am available anytime for you.

07:13.839 --> 07:14.953
Frankie, Frankie.

07:14.954 --> 07:17.610
Hi. I had an idea about how
to deelectrify the pool.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.723
Oh, that's already been dealt with.

07:19.724 --> 07:22.346
Okay, well, then, there's-.

07:22.347 --> 07:22.980
Oh, let's see.

07:22.981 --> 07:25.673
Done, done, deloused.

07:25.674 --> 07:28.181
Appraised, defused, rebuilt.

07:28.182 --> 07:31.408
De-peanut buttered,
debunked, spayed, neutered.

07:31.409 --> 07:35.913
Underway, resanctified,
plunged, deported and exhumed.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.561
Thank you.

07:37.562 --> 07:39.976
Oh, this is pretty.

07:39.977 --> 07:41.114
Huh.

07:41.115 --> 07:43.482
I'm gonna name one of my
sandwiches after her.

07:43.483 --> 07:44.922
My sandwiches suck.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.824
She is improving Greendale.

07:47.825 --> 07:48.537
Yeah, but

07:48.538 --> 07:53.141
how much can you improve Greendale
before it stops being Greendale?

07:53.142 --> 07:55.254
She didn't suffer for this place.

07:55.255 --> 07:57.181
She doesn't understand it.

07:57.182 --> 08:00.269
She's gonna end up messing
with something that-.

08:00.270 --> 08:01.895
Abed.

08:01.896 --> 08:08.825
Temporal mutation in English, Doc.

08:08.826 --> 08:11.733
Simply put Mr. President,

08:11.734 --> 08:16.464
in 12 hours these dinosaurs will become-.

08:16.465 --> 08:17.811
Mind if I sit here?

08:17.812 --> 08:19.134
Time-asaurs.

08:19.135 --> 08:22.524
Go ahead, I can reshoot.

08:22.525 --> 08:24.544
How's everything going?

08:24.545 --> 08:26.309
I have concerns.

08:26.310 --> 08:27.400
I'd like to hear them.

08:27.401 --> 08:29.306
I'm worried you're not distinct enough for

08:29.307 --> 08:31.371
Manny both in terms of
physicality and purpose.

08:31.372 --> 08:32.716
Okay.

08:32.717 --> 08:34.565
I can't determine if you
have any specific flaw,

08:34.566 --> 08:37.938
quirk, or point of view that makes you
a creative addition to the group.

08:37.940 --> 08:40.999
I don't know what that means,
but I'm writing it down.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.029
My umbrella concern is that you,

08:42.030 --> 08:44.729
as a character, represent the end
of what I used to call our show,

08:44.730 --> 08:46.999
which was once an unlikely
family of misfit students, and

08:47.000 --> 08:49.379
is now a pretty loose knit group
of students and teachers.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.029
None of whom are taking a class
together in a school which,

08:51.030 --> 08:53.629
as of your arrival, is becoming
increasingly grounded,

08:53.630 --> 08:55.969
asking questions like, how
do any of us get our money?

08:55.970 --> 08:58.409
When will we get our degrees, and what
happened to that girl I was dating?

08:58.410 --> 09:00.919
As opposed to questions I consider
more important like, what is real?

09:00.920 --> 09:01.609
What is sanity?

09:01.610 --> 09:02.709
Is there a god?

09:02.710 --> 09:03.921
Where's that Pierce hologram?

09:03.922 --> 09:05.289
Jeff said last year he
saw a Pierce hologram.

09:05.290 --> 09:06.699
None of the rest of us have ever seen it.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.129
So, if there's a Pierce ghost on campus,

09:08.130 --> 09:10.569
I'd like to get a head start on busting it.

09:10.570 --> 09:14.519
All right. This is the first I've
heard that I'm a character on a show.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.399
I'm excited to be one, but I
agree, I'll be a boring one.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.799
Quirks are not my strong suit, results are.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.769
I love quirky people.

09:20.770 --> 09:24.339
I come from a big family of
people who are literally insane.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.449
I moved down here to take
care of one of them.

09:26.450 --> 09:31.299
But I myself am exceptionally boring,
and I am quite proud to be that way,

09:31.300 --> 09:35.682
because it allows me to help the
less boring people turn quirks into

09:35.683 --> 09:36.402
results.

09:36.403 --> 09:38.511
That's the most interesting take
on not being interesting that

09:38.512 --> 09:39.142
I've ever heard.

09:39.143 --> 09:42.121
As far as what I represent about
your show, I wouldn't give me or

09:42.122 --> 09:43.623
anyone else that kind of power.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.108
Good shows change, I assume.

09:46.109 --> 09:48.151
Personally, I don't own a TV.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.516
You're the first person to say that that I

09:49.517 --> 09:50.961
didn't immediately delete from my brain.

09:50.962 --> 09:54.838
Thank you.

09:54.839 --> 09:57.532
Emergency meeting at Shirley's
Sandwiches right now.

09:57.533 --> 09:58.414
Everyone freaking out.

09:58.415 --> 09:59.946
New lady is evil.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.019
Crazy frown.

10:02.020 --> 10:03.180
[NOISE].

10:03.181 --> 10:04.433
I should go.

10:04.434 --> 10:09.060
Abed, I could really use someone's help
in learning the ropes around here.

10:09.061 --> 10:12.705
I'll ask around.

10:12.706 --> 10:14.609
Friends, dumb hats.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.002
Totally talking down to you.

10:16.003 --> 10:16.954
She hates you.

10:16.955 --> 10:18.556
I got it from Jared.

10:18.557 --> 10:19.439
What are you guys doing back here?

10:19.440 --> 10:20.275
Are you the big chilling?

10:20.276 --> 10:23.489
Yeah, only there's not a hippie that
died to make us come together and

10:23.490 --> 10:24.036
complain.

10:24.037 --> 10:24.942
It's our school.

10:24.943 --> 10:26.172
Frankie's taking over the campus.

10:26.173 --> 10:28.625
She cancelled ladder's,
she's banning substances,

10:28.626 --> 10:30.677
she wants to shut down
Shirley's sandwiches.

10:30.678 --> 10:32.000
She called Annie a bitch.

10:32.001 --> 10:33.626
She implied I was a bitch.

10:33.627 --> 10:34.909
She implied Annie was a stuck up bitch who

10:34.910 --> 10:36.133
thinks she's better than everyone.

10:36.134 --> 10:37.341
Okay, now you're just-.

10:37.342 --> 10:38.339
She was nice to me.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.500
In fact we kinda got along.

10:39.501 --> 10:43.796
Abed, are you sure she wasn't
actually being sweetly condescending?

10:43.797 --> 10:45.328
Yup, I learned to pick up on that one.

10:45.329 --> 10:48.841
I make a movement that we form
a separate, secret, committee.

10:48.842 --> 10:52.161
I second Britta's motion, not movement.

10:52.162 --> 10:55.554
I third Annie's number two-ing
of the movement Brita made.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.624
Gross.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.814
Our mission to preserve the real Greendale.

10:58.815 --> 11:01.264
Oppose Frankie or drink.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.843
Are you guys sure she's bad?

11:05.844 --> 11:08.569
Are you sure you're not doing what I
usually do, overreacting to change?

11:08.570 --> 11:10.258
Nobody's ever doing what
you usually do Abed.

11:10.259 --> 11:10.919
You're nuts.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.629
Huh.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.429
In a good way.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.139
I'm just saying.

11:13.140 --> 11:13.699
Leave reality to us.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.869
We always support you.

11:15.870 --> 11:17.729
Don't make it more dramatic than it is.

11:17.730 --> 11:18.969
It's a blood oath to defy evil.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.210
You're either in or you're out.

11:21.610 --> 11:22.999
Can I hang around if I don't do the oath.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.629
Oh, gee. You mean just be friends?

11:25.630 --> 11:27.172
Sure. Great, Abed.

11:27.173 --> 11:28.196
Okay.

11:31.526 --> 11:32.896
Can I have some pretzels?

11:36.820 --> 11:38.142
No.

11:38.143 --> 11:42.537
Those are secret committee pretzels.

11:42.538 --> 11:44.490
Okay.

11:44.491 --> 11:49.761
Well.

11:49.762 --> 11:51.984
Yes, that was a test.

If I have to start drinking in the

12:30.855 --> 12:33.721
has to change from Trent Reznor to
Johnny Cash doing Trent Reznor.

I'm a bartender Annie,

12:34.778 --> 12:37.150
I know a little bit more about
the human side of service.

12:38.380 --> 12:39.369
I can't eat this.

12:39.370 --> 12:40.379
Can I have my money back?

You're human garbage.

Hi, Mr. Winger.

12:44.140 --> 12:45.379
Nice lecture yesterday.

Don't patronize me Dick.

12:46.290 --> 12:47.579
It might not seem like this, but

12:47.580 --> 12:51.819
you're killing small, black owned business.

12:51.820 --> 12:53.661
I'll call it even for a drink with Mr.
Winger.

12:55.970 --> 12:56.589
That's absurd.

12:56.590 --> 12:57.090
You will?

13:00.209 --> 13:01.002
Let's see some ID.

13:07.952 --> 13:10.714
Well I guess we'll wait for
the others before we start.

13:10.715 --> 13:12.038
I don't think they're coming.

13:12.039 --> 13:16.229
What? The committee had a meeting
last night and decided you are evil.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.839
Ooh. Wait, you guys had
a meeting last night?

13:17.840 --> 13:18.549
So, we broke up as friends.

13:18.550 --> 13:21.139
Because I don't think you're evil.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.789
I think you scare people,

13:22.790 --> 13:26.099
because you live in the real
world instead of up your butt.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.789
I'm sorry that happened, Abed.

13:27.790 --> 13:29.369
It's like I said yesterday at lunch.

13:29.370 --> 13:31.140
Drama and conflict are exciting and easy.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.809
Making a difference can be pretty boring.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.289
You guys had lunch?

13:35.290 --> 13:36.299
I'd like to try to live in that world.

13:36.300 --> 13:39.949
I'm a little tired from all the drama,
the heroes, the villains, monsters.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.952
Pokemons. You're just a person
that sees things the way they are.

13:41.953 --> 13:42.765
Leprechauns.

13:42.766 --> 13:43.694
Scary.

13:43.695 --> 13:44.907
I don't know if I can be like that but

13:44.908 --> 13:46.489
I don't think it makes
sense to be against it.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.489
You guys ever hear of The Slender Man?

13:48.490 --> 13:50.199
I'd like to try to help you.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.399
And if possible, learn from you.

You guys on Reddit, 4Chan?

13:52.850 --> 13:53.989
That would be great, Abed.

13:53.990 --> 13:54.644

What do you mean?

14:29.001 --> 14:30.701
Someone told me you were
sweeping, straightening clocks.

14:30.702 --> 14:32.269
Why are you cleaning that sign?

14:32.270 --> 14:33.469
I gave you a list.

14:33.470 --> 14:34.829
Yeah, the list felt
pretty similar visually.

me verifying Diane's invoice to me

14:38.630 --> 14:40.529
emailing confirmation to Diane.

14:40.530 --> 14:41.209
Right.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.519
But a montage is what, Abed?

14:42.520 --> 14:44.209
It's a movie apologizing for reality.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.689
And we are where?

14:45.690 --> 14:49.281
Reality. And what do people do here?

Oh, nice.

20:55.677 --> 20:58.027
[MUSIC]

20:58.028 --> 21:00.332
Welcome to ladder!

21:00.333 --> 21:01.919
[APPLAUSE].

21:01.920 --> 21:03.188
Yeah!

21:03.189 --> 21:13.868
[SOUND].

21:13.869 --> 21:17.339
Ladder!

21:17.340 --> 21:21.077
Who wants to see the ladders
professor go higher?

21:21.078 --> 21:24.119
[APPLAUSE].

21:24.120 --> 21:26.928
Ladder!

21:26.929 --> 21:29.891
Aah! [NOISE].

21:29.892 --> 21:31.609
You did it, Jeff Winger!

21:31.610 --> 21:36.764
This is your school now.

21:36.765 --> 21:39.852
[SOUND] Annie.

21:39.853 --> 21:42.569
It was worth it.

21:42.570 --> 21:43.782
Aah!

21:43.783 --> 21:47.753
[MUSIC]

21:47.754 --> 21:51.259
[MUSIC]

21:51.260 --> 21:55.260
All right, that should be the extent
of the professor's medical bills.

21:55.261 --> 21:57.071
What, what about that
lawsuits from the students?

21:57.072 --> 21:58.464
I think we should fight those.

21:58.465 --> 22:00.322
Actually, I suggest you
settle out of court.

22:00.323 --> 22:01.065
This is my fault.

22:01.066 --> 22:01.738
Obviously not.

22:01.739 --> 22:02.388
It's my fault.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.155
It's my fault.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.320
Guys, it's my fault.

22:05.321 --> 22:06.690
It's my fault.

22:06.691 --> 22:07.735
It's my fault.

22:07.736 --> 22:08.385
It's my fault.

22:08.386 --> 22:09.523
It's my fault.

22:09.524 --> 22:10.567
It's my fault.

22:10.568 --> 22:11.543
[CROSSTALK].

22:11.544 --> 22:12.634
It's my fault.

22:12.635 --> 22:13.679
It's my fault.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.959
It's my fault.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.060
[CROSSTALK].

22:16.061 --> 22:17.546
All right, all right, all right.

22:17.547 --> 22:19.404
So, whose fault wasn't it?

22:19.405 --> 22:23.970
And who knows anything about
handling anything like this?

22:23.971 --> 22:26.789
In terms of hierarchy, I'm
a big believer in it.

22:26.790 --> 22:30.299
Someone needs to say, I'm in
charge, and that person is me.

22:30.300 --> 22:33.169
That's my decision.

22:33.170 --> 22:34.933
Wait, what?

22:34.934 --> 22:35.676
I'm sorry?

22:35.677 --> 22:36.559
Who talks like that?

22:36.560 --> 22:38.997
Why would anyone hire someone so pompous?

22:38.998 --> 22:42.773
Miss Dart, word of advice, change your
personality, or start looking for

22:42.774 --> 22:44.430
companies run by insane people.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.405
[SOUND].

22:45.406 --> 22:46.287
Don't hire this woman.

22:46.288 --> 22:47.147
Fifth time's the charm.

22:47.148 --> 22:49.376
He's barged the four offices
screaming, don't hire this woman.

22:49.377 --> 22:51.605
What the hell is going on?

22:51.606 --> 22:52.603
What are you doing here?

22:52.604 --> 22:53.648
How did you even find me?

22:53.649 --> 22:55.041
I emailed Diane.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.550
She knows way too much about
your schedule, by the way.

22:56.551 --> 23:00.753
Whatever he's offering you,
Greendale, well, we can't double it.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.727
We probably can't even match it.

23:02.728 --> 23:07.629
Whatever he's offering you, Greendale
will give you less, and an apology.

23:07.630 --> 23:11.257
Do you know-. Shh.

23:11.258 --> 23:14.387
It's not enough, but

23:14.388 --> 23:19.337
maybe if you added more apologies.

23:19.338 --> 23:24.567
Like a montage of them?

23:24.568 --> 23:26.518
We're sorry.

23:26.519 --> 23:36.519

24:59.964 --> 25:09.964
[SOUND].

25:14.940 --> 25:17.076
I told you I wouldn't be
needing dinner tonight.

25:17.077 --> 25:18.933
I'm guessing you wouldn't.

25:18.934 --> 25:19.490
Not if you're looking for this.

25:19.491 --> 25:23.123
[MUSIC]

25:23.124 --> 25:23.999
How'd you know?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.339
Nobody makes more crumbs than a cook.

25:26.340 --> 25:28.849
Well, the same goes for
clues and detectives.

25:28.850 --> 25:31.259
You're too busy solving murders
to get away with your own.

25:31.260 --> 25:34.829
Well, then, what about the case
of my wife and my legs, Shirley?

25:34.830 --> 25:36.199
Can you solve that one, huh?

25:36.200 --> 25:37.009
Can you?

25:37.010 --> 25:39.109
Cuz if you can't, then I ain't
got nothing to live for.

25:39.110 --> 25:41.565
Begging your pardon, Mr. Butcher.

25:41.566 --> 25:44.353
I think the people on this
bayou would disagree.

25:44.354 --> 25:45.642
You rescued a runaway girl today.

25:45.643 --> 25:47.233
Rescued, balls.

25:47.234 --> 25:50.275
I couldn't even rescue
a, a bulb from a socket.

25:50.276 --> 25:52.028
And you did all the work today, didn't you?

25:52.029 --> 25:56.196
I'm just a detective from the
swamps of Atlanta, can't even walk.

25:56.197 --> 25:56.816
[NOISE] Oh.

25:56.817 --> 25:57.652
Aah!

25:57.653 --> 26:00.288
[NOISE] Then let me be your legs.

26:00.289 --> 26:03.790
Let me do for you what I did today
every week until you find your wife.

26:03.791 --> 26:04.835
Or your legs.

26:04.836 --> 26:09.374
You are a stubborn son of
a bitch, Shirley Bennett.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.083
Now come on.

26:10.084 --> 26:11.418
I have dinner to make.

26:11.419 --> 26:12.927
You got cases to solve.

26:12.928 --> 26:18.674
[MUSIC]

26:18.675 --> 26:23.887
[NOISE] Feeling someone's gonna
murder some tater tots tonight.

26:23.888 --> 26:30.516
That's no mystery at all.

26:38.185 --> 26:39.420
Next week, on The Butcher and

26:39.421 --> 26:41.990
The Baker, when a new detective
on the Bayou disappears, and

26:41.991 --> 26:45.115
Butcher is the prime suspect, it's up
to Shirley to cook up some answers.
