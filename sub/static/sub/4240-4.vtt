in the United States.

an international
cheerleading competition,

on the local news?

And I love you
just as much.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.469
Okay?

39:10.890 --> 39:13.392
Thanks for
telling me, Kurt.

39:22.736 --> 39:24.653
You're sure, right?

39:24.738 --> 39:27.781
- Yeah, Dad. I'm sure.
- Just checking.

39:31.161 --> 39:33.203
[Bell Ringing]

39:35.123 --> 39:36.915
Hey.

39:38.084 --> 39:42.588
Here.
It's my gee-ge.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.049
This is the baby blanket
my dad got me
the day I was born.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.217
It was the only thing
I had to remember him by.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.720
I used to cry
without it.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.723
I took it
everywhere with me,
so it's a little dirty.

39:52.807 --> 39:56.018
But I want our baby
to have it.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.854
I'm gonna do
everything I can
to be a good father.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.647
[Laughs]

40:01.858 --> 40:03.817
Thank you, Finn.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.528
Hey, guys.
How you doing?

40:08.656 --> 40:12.534
- Lately I've been getting
really sick in the morning.
- Must be a virus.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.120
Hey, you putting on
a little weight?
You should watch your carbs.

40:15.205 --> 40:18.248
They're not gonna be able
to hoist you to the top
of that cheerleading pyramid...

40:18.333 --> 40:19.750
much longer.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.628
Hey, don't talk
to my girlfriend like that.

40:27.634 --> 40:30.844
You know what?
You're right.
I was out of line.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.974
See you guys around.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.108
You know, there's a question
I get asked a lot.

40:44.192 --> 40:48.487
Whether I'm accepting
an honorary doctorate or
performing a citizen's arrest,

40:48.571 --> 40:52.282
people ask me,
"Sue, what's your secret?"

40:52.367 --> 40:54.618
Well, I'll
tell you my secret,
western Ohio.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.913
Hey, guys, let's give
a big Glee welcome
to our three new members,

40:57.997 --> 41:00.082
fresh off their big win
on Friday night—

41:00.166 --> 41:03.669
Noah Puckerman,
Matt Rutherford
and Mike Chang.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.796
Regionals, here we come.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.591
Sue Sylvester's not afraid
to shake things up.

41:09.676 --> 41:13.512
Let's start today
with "Tonight"
from West Side Story.

41:16.266 --> 41:20.853
Tina. Show us what you got.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.647
[Sue]
You know, I'm tired
of hearing people complain,

41:23.731 --> 41:27.860
"I'm riddled with this disease"
or "I was in that tsunami."

41:27.944 --> 41:31.321
To them I say,
shake it up a bit.
Get out of your box.

41:31.406 --> 41:34.658
Even if that box happens
to be where you're living.

41:34.742 --> 41:38.829
I thought you had
Glee practice, my little
multitasking star.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.623
I quit.
I'm yours exclusively.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.126
I'll often yell
at homeless people,

41:44.210 --> 41:46.962
"Hey, how's that homelessness
working out for you?

41:47.046 --> 41:49.590
Give not being homeless
a try, huh?"

41:49.716 --> 41:52.926
Maybe this time in B-flat.
[Sue]
You know something, Ohio?

41:53.011 --> 41:56.013
It's not easy to break out
of your comfort zone.

41:56.097 --> 42:00.017
People will tear you down,
tell you you shouldn't have
bothered in the first place.

42:00.101 --> 42:02.394
But let me tell you something.

42:02.478 --> 42:07.024
There's not much of a difference
between a stadium full
of cheering fans...

42:07.108 --> 42:10.485
and an angry crowd
screaming abuse at you.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.863
They're both just making
a lot of noise.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.365
How you take it
is up to you.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.784
Convince yourself
they're cheering for you.

42:17.869 --> 42:21.622
You do that,
and someday, they will.

42:21.706 --> 42:25.334
And that's how Sue sees it.
