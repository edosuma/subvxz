WEBVTT

00:03.164 --> 00:05.464
You know,
downward-facing dog

00:05.466 --> 00:09.669
comes from the Sanskrit phrase
<i>adho mukha shvanasana.</i>

00:09.671 --> 00:11.704
Oh, that's beautiful.
What does it mean?

00:11.706 --> 00:14.273
"Downward-facing dog."

00:15.210 --> 00:16.909
Yeah, I guess they
don't have Sanskrit

00:16.911 --> 00:19.712
for "butts up and heads down."

00:19.714 --> 00:21.214
Hey, we wrote the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

00:21.216 --> 00:23.783
If it involves butts,
there's a word for it.

00:24.819 --> 00:27.119
I thought we were getting
breakfast before work.

00:27.121 --> 00:28.654
Oh, right, sorry.

00:28.656 --> 00:30.656
It's my fault. I asked
Penny to do yoga with me.

00:30.658 --> 00:32.758
If you want, I can get
ready in five minutes.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.861
(chuckles)
It's cute that you think that.

00:34.863 --> 00:37.163
Don't worry about it.

00:37.165 --> 00:38.164
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

00:38.166 --> 00:39.532
Would you mind taking
Cinnamon for a walk?

00:39.534 --> 00:41.400
Sure.
You're living here for free.

00:41.402 --> 00:42.668
I guess I owe you.

00:44.405 --> 00:46.372
Bye, Cinnamon.
Be a good girl.

00:46.374 --> 00:48.241
Yeah, bye, sweetie!
Bye!

00:48.243 --> 00:49.942
Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.
(chuckles)

00:51.145 --> 00:55.314
Okay, and tree pose.

00:57.085 --> 01:00.152

01:30.419 --> 01:32.385
Things have been going
really well

01:32.387 --> 01:34.588
with the infinite
resistance gyroscope.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.523
That's great. How so?

01:36.525 --> 01:38.058
Oh, the project is classified.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.159
I can't tell you.

01:39.161 --> 01:43.330
Oh, I suppose I could redact
the classified parts.

01:43.332 --> 01:47.267
All right, um, I came up
with an elegant solution

01:47.269 --> 01:50.637
to the... (speaks indistinctly)
(horn honks)

01:50.639 --> 01:51.871
I used the...

01:51.873 --> 01:53.840
(speaks indistinctly)
(horn honks)

01:53.842 --> 01:57.110
And then I... (speaking indistinctly)
(horn honking)

02:00.015 --> 02:01.781
And that did it.

02:01.783 --> 02:04.184
(horn honking)

02:04.186 --> 02:06.686
Wow, I wonder
what they're redacting.

02:07.990 --> 02:10.223
Why don't you ask me
what I'm working on?

02:10.225 --> 02:13.360
Oh, very well.
What have you been working on?

02:13.362 --> 02:15.729
And feel free to honk
during the boring parts.

02:16.565 --> 02:18.298
I'm doing some experiments
to show

02:18.300 --> 02:20.133
that the signal
to move a muscle occurs

02:20.135 --> 02:22.269
before you know
you even decided to move it.

02:22.271 --> 02:24.638
W... So you're attempting
to pinpoint

02:24.640 --> 02:27.340
where consciousness resides
in the brain.

02:27.342 --> 02:29.676
Yes, I'm trying to figure out
the nanometer

02:29.678 --> 02:32.112
and the attosecond,
precisely where and when

02:32.114 --> 02:33.880
an event of awareness
takes place.

02:33.882 --> 02:36.416
Well, what do you know?

02:36.418 --> 02:38.918
Here I was, waiting
to be bored with biology,

02:38.920 --> 02:41.788
and instead you tickle
my intellectual fancy.

02:41.790 --> 02:45.292
Which, unlike my body,
is an okay place to tickle.

02:46.762 --> 02:48.194
You know, when I was six,

02:48.196 --> 02:50.964
I wanted to marry the gorilla
from <i>Good Night, Gorilla.</i>

02:52.267 --> 02:53.867
Maybe I was onto something.

02:56.305 --> 02:59.339
Gentlemen,
the most interesting thing

02:59.341 --> 03:01.074
just happened with this spoon.

03:01.076 --> 03:03.977
Unless it was singing
"Be Our Guest," I doubt it.

03:06.048 --> 03:08.014
Yeah, I picked it up
without thinking about it.

03:08.016 --> 03:10.216
Which raises a
neuroscientific question,

03:10.218 --> 03:12.519
when did I decide
to pick it up?

03:12.521 --> 03:14.921
The bigger question is, what are
you gonna eat with that spoon?

03:14.923 --> 03:17.357
You didn't get any food.

03:18.193 --> 03:20.260
He does raise
an interesting point.

03:20.262 --> 03:23.830
Amy is studying the time lag
between intent and awareness,

03:23.832 --> 03:25.231
and I realized
that applies

03:25.233 --> 03:27.367
to the measurement problem
in quantum mechanics.

03:27.369 --> 03:29.769
Now, I recognize there
will be a time lag

03:29.771 --> 03:32.038
between me saying that and
you Googling what it means,

03:32.040 --> 03:33.273
so I'll wait.

03:34.509 --> 03:36.376
I understand it, Sheldon.

03:36.378 --> 03:38.011
Yeah, me, too.

03:38.013 --> 03:39.145
I'm sorry, I spaced.

03:39.147 --> 03:41.614
Are we still talking
about the spoon?

03:42.551 --> 03:44.284
It's nice to see you
taking an interest

03:44.286 --> 03:45.352
in Amy's work.

03:45.354 --> 03:46.619
Well, don't get me wrong.

03:46.621 --> 03:48.555
Neurobiology's nothing more
than the science

03:48.557 --> 03:49.889
of gray squishy stuff.

03:49.891 --> 03:51.958
But, you know,
when it connects to physics,

03:51.960 --> 03:54.627
gas up the Ford, Martha,
we're going for a drive.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.100
So did you
confront Jennifer?

04:00.102 --> 04:01.634
I was going to,
but she called in sick.

04:01.636 --> 04:03.303
And guess who else
called in sick.

04:03.305 --> 04:04.537
Paul.
Paul.

04:04.539 --> 04:06.272
Who's Paul?

04:06.274 --> 04:08.274
Oh, you met him at the
office Christmas party.

04:08.276 --> 04:09.142
He's married to Nancy.

04:09.144 --> 04:11.945
Oh, sure.
Wait, Nancy?

04:11.947 --> 04:13.947
I bet Jennifer gets
a promotion out of this,

04:13.949 --> 04:16.449
which is so unfair because I
work twice as hard as she does.

04:16.451 --> 04:18.118
Don't worry,
Jerry won't be fooled

04:18.120 --> 04:20.353
by that type of behavior.

04:23.658 --> 04:25.892
Jerry?

04:25.894 --> 04:28.928
It didn't work for Randy,
it didn't work for Tina,

04:28.930 --> 04:30.830
it sure as hell isn't
gonna work for Jennifer.

04:30.832 --> 04:33.032
Well, I hope not.
I just hate when

04:33.034 --> 04:34.734
people play
those kinds of games.

04:36.004 --> 04:37.337
Tina?

04:37.339 --> 04:40.407
With your sales record,
you have nothing to worry about.

04:40.409 --> 04:42.108
Mm.

04:42.110 --> 04:45.879
I went to your office
Christmas party?

04:48.683 --> 04:51.518
You know, I like harp lessons,

04:51.520 --> 04:54.954
but I'm thinking of switching
to elevator repair lessons.

04:56.691 --> 04:57.624
What are you working on?

04:57.626 --> 05:00.326
I was thinking about
your experiment

05:00.328 --> 05:02.262
on the neuroscience
of decision making,

05:02.264 --> 05:03.596
and I realized,

05:03.598 --> 05:05.632
if we connect it
to the measurement problem

05:05.634 --> 05:07.600
in quantum mechanics,
we have a chance

05:07.602 --> 05:09.235
to disprove the role
of consciousness

05:09.237 --> 05:11.171
in the Copenhagen
Interpretation.

05:11.173 --> 05:14.507
Wait, are you saying if
we combine my experiment

05:14.509 --> 05:15.708
with your calculations,

05:15.710 --> 05:17.777
we can determine
the precise moment in time

05:17.779 --> 05:19.646
when the wave function
collapses?

05:19.648 --> 05:21.481
It could be the most
inspired combination

05:21.483 --> 05:23.550
since I mixed red Icee
into my blue Icee.

05:26.621 --> 05:28.755
It was like drinking
2/7 of the rainbow.

05:30.725 --> 05:32.025
Sheldon, this is
really interesting.

05:32.027 --> 05:35.328
Yeah, and this one won't
stain my teeth purple.

05:35.330 --> 05:37.130
You know, we've never
collaborated

05:37.132 --> 05:38.598
professionally before.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.600
Are you worried it might
affect our relationship?

05:40.602 --> 05:42.836
That is a valid point.

05:42.838 --> 05:45.371
Perhaps we should establish
some ground rules.

05:45.373 --> 05:46.840
Well, that would
make me feel better.

05:46.842 --> 05:47.941
All right, let's
start right now.

05:47.943 --> 05:50.710
Uh, rule number one,
no using sexuality

05:50.712 --> 05:52.579
to get your way.

05:53.648 --> 05:55.281
That's a ridiculous rule.

05:55.283 --> 05:57.083
Is it?

06:03.525 --> 06:06.259
Okay, how is that?

06:11.933 --> 06:13.600
I can actually feel the toxins

06:13.602 --> 06:16.302
being pulled out of my skin.

06:16.304 --> 06:19.138
Well, this is
a moisturizing mask.

06:19.140 --> 06:21.407
Oh, well, then I can
actually feel

06:21.409 --> 06:25.111
the moisture going into my skin.

06:25.113 --> 06:26.379
Hey, I hope you don't mind,
I used a little

06:26.381 --> 06:27.814
of your eye cream
last night.

06:27.816 --> 06:30.350
I thought someone looked
brighter and tighter.

06:36.258 --> 06:39.025
I'd still like to know
who Jerry is.

06:39.027 --> 06:40.693
Don't worry about it.
Hey, after this,

06:40.695 --> 06:42.395
how about we all go out
and do something together?

06:42.397 --> 06:44.764
That would be great.
Thank you.

06:44.766 --> 06:46.065
You want to go shopping?

06:46.067 --> 06:48.401
Ooh, yes. Fun.

06:48.403 --> 06:50.136
Or we could do something
we'll all enjoy,

06:50.138 --> 06:51.571
like play a board game.

Oh, good.

07:32.881 --> 07:34.514
What are they?
Okay, uh,

07:34.516 --> 07:36.416
number one:
in matters of physics,

07:36.418 --> 07:38.017
I have the final say.

07:38.019 --> 07:41.054
In matters of neuroscience,
you have the final say.

07:41.056 --> 07:42.322
Unless I disagree.

07:42.324 --> 07:44.524
Oh, here.

07:44.526 --> 07:47.627
Number two: when we publish,
my name goes first.

07:47.629 --> 07:50.697
Oh, subsequently, if we win any
awards, I speak first.

07:50.699 --> 07:53.299
I don't want to be talking when
the orchestra plays us off.

07:53.301 --> 07:55.568
Can I see that?

07:55.570 --> 07:57.070
Oh, of course.

08:02.744 --> 08:05.311
I'll get that back.

08:05.313 --> 08:06.946
Like all my underwear,
that notebook says

08:06.948 --> 08:09.048
"Property of Sheldon Cooper."

08:09.050 --> 08:11.784
Sheldon, if we're
gonna have ground rules,

08:11.786 --> 08:13.219
I'll tell you
the first ground rule--

08:13.221 --> 08:14.554
I make the ground rules.

08:14.556 --> 08:17.390
I'd write that down,
but I can't now, can I?

08:21.096 --> 08:23.296
I mean, they didn't
<i>say</i> anything,

08:23.298 --> 08:24.797
but I just kind of
felt like I was being

08:24.799 --> 08:26.265
a weird third wheel.

08:26.267 --> 08:29.869
Huh, so you <i>can</i> tell
what that feels like.

08:29.871 --> 08:31.371
Interesting.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.041
Anyway, I figured I can
hang out with my friends

08:35.043 --> 08:36.509
and have fun, too.

08:36.510 --> 08:39.212
Well, if your idea of fun
is riding in a minivan

08:39.214 --> 08:40.279
to Target for diapers,

08:40.280 --> 08:42.347
things are about
to get nuts.

08:43.684 --> 08:45.518
Oh, it's just nice
to be with people

08:45.520 --> 08:47.086
who are happy to have me around.

08:47.088 --> 08:48.888
Isn't that right, Halley?

08:48.890 --> 08:51.190
(Halley crying)

08:52.227 --> 08:54.827
Well, at least someone had
the courage to say it.

08:57.265 --> 08:59.499
Thank you, you are
a good citizen.

08:59.501 --> 09:01.768
Told you.

09:02.904 --> 09:04.270
Go ahead, throw
my underwear out the window.

09:04.272 --> 09:05.438
Same thing's gonna happen.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.840
Terrific.

09:07.842 --> 09:09.375
Do you want to hear our
new set of ground rules?

09:09.377 --> 09:10.643
Fire away.

09:10.645 --> 09:13.813
Number one:
we're on the same team,

09:13.815 --> 09:15.048
we're not in competition.

09:15.050 --> 09:18.985
That's smart, because
Sheldon: 1, Amy: 0.

09:20.155 --> 09:23.022
Number two: disagreements
can happen politely.

09:23.024 --> 09:25.625
There's no need
to call an idea stupid.

09:25.627 --> 09:29.095
Aw, someone drew
a penis in it.

09:30.198 --> 09:32.131
Are you listening?

09:32.133 --> 09:33.499
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

09:33.501 --> 09:34.701
Number three.

09:34.703 --> 09:37.336
To avoid getting frustrated,
we take built-in breaks

09:37.338 --> 09:39.672
and reward our successes
with a small treat.

09:39.674 --> 09:41.274
Ooh, that sounds fun.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.176
Now, we're talking about
real treats, right?

09:43.178 --> 09:46.546
Not Bible verses like my
mother used to give me.

09:46.548 --> 09:48.915
Whatever you want.

09:48.917 --> 09:51.350
So, shall we get to work?

09:51.352 --> 09:53.486
Biology and physics
coming together--

09:53.488 --> 09:56.355
this is like the peanut
butter cup of the mind.

09:56.357 --> 09:58.925
Oh, I know what I
want my treat to be!

10:00.862 --> 10:03.830
♪ Imagine me and you, I do ♪

10:03.832 --> 10:06.999

Look at that.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.141
Yes, this is remarkable.

10:48.143 --> 10:50.943
So we're agreed:
it's complete garbage.

10:53.848 --> 10:55.648
By the way,
your name can go first.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:05.688 --> 11:07.598
I mean, I'm glad
they're getting along,

11:07.599 --> 11:09.466
but it's starting to
make me uncomfortable.

11:09.468 --> 11:11.868
Well, are you worried he's
like another man in her life?

11:11.870 --> 11:14.838
A little, until I saw them
in matching tops, so...

11:16.341 --> 11:18.642
Nice. 174 diapers.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.844
That ought
to get us to Wednesday.

11:22.714 --> 11:24.481
Well, have you talked
to them about it?

11:24.483 --> 11:26.149
Well, what am I
supposed to say--

11:26.151 --> 11:27.717
"Stop having fun without me"?

11:27.719 --> 11:30.387
This one says that
every time I go out.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.023
See? I listen to you.

11:34.893 --> 11:37.494
Look, Raj just
gets along with women.

11:37.496 --> 11:38.695
I-I know,

11:38.697 --> 11:40.230
but he was my friend first.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.665
It's like she's stealing him

11:41.667 --> 11:43.300
and they're just
having the best time

11:43.302 --> 11:46.169
doing all their dumb
girly stuff together.

11:46.171 --> 11:47.337
You sure you don't fit in?

11:47.339 --> 11:49.573
You sound like
a catty bitch to me.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.180
I don't know where
we went wrong.

11:57.182 --> 11:59.649
Yeah, the math is so inelegant.

11:59.651 --> 12:02.752
I'm not even sure
it makes sense.

12:02.754 --> 12:05.322
Well, don't give up.
Maybe we can fix it.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.063
Can you stop breathing
so loud?

12:13.065 --> 12:16.199
I can hear your nose
whistling.

12:16.201 --> 12:19.336
I can hear your face
talking, so we're even.

12:24.576 --> 12:27.310
All right,
either blow your nose

12:27.312 --> 12:29.012
or teach it to play
"Camptown Races."

12:30.549 --> 12:32.782
Fine. Fine.
You want me to blow my nose?

12:32.784 --> 12:34.084
Here, I'll blow it.

12:34.086 --> 12:37.320
(nose blowing aggressively)

12:39.925 --> 12:41.291
Better?

12:41.293 --> 12:43.627
No, I can still hear it.

12:43.629 --> 12:46.463
Oh, wait, that's me.
Never mind, it's fine.

12:46.465 --> 12:47.697
You know, you're
exhausting.

12:47.699 --> 12:49.432
I knew working together
was a bad idea.

12:49.434 --> 12:51.168
Hold on.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.137
I see what's wrong here.
We did the propagation only to

12:54.139 --> 12:56.773
the occipital lobe, not
to the prefrontal cortex.

12:56.775 --> 13:00.310
That would mean that
this delayed parameter

13:00.312 --> 13:03.446
should be increased
250 milliseconds.

13:03.448 --> 13:05.982
Oh, that is much better.

13:05.984 --> 13:08.585
Yeah, boy, if good ideas
came out of your brain the way

13:08.587 --> 13:10.754
mucus comes out of your nose,
we'd be in good shape.

13:14.993 --> 13:17.794
Now, take a sip,

13:17.796 --> 13:19.663
swirl it around
your mouth,

13:19.665 --> 13:21.464
and try to notice
the flavors,

13:21.466 --> 13:24.801
the tannins,
the textures.

13:27.539 --> 13:28.538
Well?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.340
I probably should have

13:30.342 --> 13:32.576
spit out my gum first.

13:32.578 --> 13:36.746
(both laugh)

13:36.748 --> 13:39.115
Yeah. You know,

13:39.117 --> 13:40.951
the last couple of weeks
have been pretty rough,

13:40.953 --> 13:42.319
but, uh, staying
here with you guys

13:42.321 --> 13:43.927
has really helped take
my mind off of it.

13:43.951 --> 13:44.655
Mm. Well,

13:44.656 --> 13:46.790
we've loved having you around.
Right, sweetie?

13:49.261 --> 13:50.827
Leonard?

13:50.829 --> 13:52.629
Yeah, when
did he leave?

13:52.631 --> 13:54.998
Yeah, that's rude.

13:57.135 --> 13:59.502
You know, it's nice
to spend time with people

13:59.504 --> 14:03.106
who don't talk about work like
it's some kind of soap opera.

14:03.108 --> 14:06.042
Jennifer still trying
to sleep her way to the top?

14:07.913 --> 14:09.779
Yeah.

14:09.781 --> 14:13.116
You should be happy someone
wants to do the stuff with Penny

14:13.118 --> 14:14.351
you don't want to.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.080
Yeah, I wish I had that
with Howard.

14:16.104 --> 14:16.921
Wait.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.389
What? What do I make you do?

14:19.391 --> 14:21.291
Let's see:
the magic store,

14:21.293 --> 14:22.826
the <i>Doctor Who</i>
convention,

14:22.828 --> 14:26.029
the National Belt Buckle
Collector's meet and greet.

14:26.031 --> 14:29.132
It said right there
on the invitation,

14:29.134 --> 14:30.233
"Buckle up for fun."

14:30.235 --> 14:31.935
It's not my fault
you didn't listen.

14:33.538 --> 14:35.872
I'm sure I'm overreacting.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.874
You're entitled
to feel how you feel.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.076
If you don't like it,
you should just talk to her.

14:40.078 --> 14:42.445
I don't want to sound
like a jealous baby.

14:42.447 --> 14:45.282
Oh, then maybe
you shouldn't talk to her.

14:47.552 --> 14:48.685
You know, I
had a feeling

14:48.687 --> 14:50.287
you were using the wrong
computational model,

14:50.289 --> 14:52.455
but I didn't say anything
'cause you're so sensitive.

14:52.457 --> 14:54.124
(grunts) Just because
I am easily bothered

14:54.126 --> 14:56.559
by light, heat, sound, smell
and the way birds look at me

14:56.561 --> 14:57.861
does not mean
I'm sensitive!

15:00.132 --> 15:01.598
Hey,

15:01.600 --> 15:04.100
I wonder what kind of success
we'd have

15:04.102 --> 15:07.237
if we defined measurement
as the first moment

15:07.239 --> 15:09.973
that an action potential
is seen by the visual cortex.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.943
(gasps) That is a daring
and insightful solution.

15:13.945 --> 15:15.478
We're finally making progress.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.314
I wish we could do it
without fighting.

15:17.316 --> 15:21.318
What if the fighting is the
reason we're making progress?

15:22.521 --> 15:25.422
I suppose it's conceivable
that the hormones associated

15:25.424 --> 15:27.324
with our fight-or-flight
response

15:27.326 --> 15:29.793
could be sharpening
our cognitive processes.

15:29.795 --> 15:31.861
Well, if that's the case,

15:31.863 --> 15:35.765
then your grandparents mumble
and have bad posture.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.669
How dare you speak that way
about my Grammy--

15:39.671 --> 15:41.304
hey, wait a second. Wait.

15:44.376 --> 15:48.478
Delta "T" could equal
alpha sub-zero.

15:49.247 --> 15:52.816
It seems we have
a choice to make.

15:52.818 --> 15:56.353
Abandon all ground rules
in the name of science,

15:56.355 --> 16:00.590
or... give up collaborating for
the sake of our relationship.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.860
There's only one
clear choice.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.663
Science it is.
No, you bonehead!

16:06.665 --> 16:09.132
Name-calling,
that is perfect.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.767
Now, when I get
to this equation here,

16:10.769 --> 16:12.102
really let me have it.
You know?

16:12.104 --> 16:14.104
I-If it helps,
I'm not the sharpest dresser.

16:17.609 --> 16:21.411
Anyway, I know it's silly,
but since Raj moved in,

16:21.413 --> 16:23.380
I've been feeling
a little left out.

16:26.218 --> 16:29.753
Well, sweetie,
that's crazy.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.921
No, no, Penny,
don't dismiss his feelings.

16:31.923 --> 16:32.856
Thank you. I just feel...

16:32.858 --> 16:34.657
Hang on,
I'm not saying

16:34.659 --> 16:36.326
that his feelings
aren't crazy.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.994
I just don't want him
to think that

16:37.996 --> 16:39.329
this isn't
a safe place.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.597
Well, to be truthful...

16:40.599 --> 16:41.965
PENNY: Well, why wouldn't
this be a safe place? I mean,

16:41.967 --> 16:44.100
he's surrounded by his wife
and one of his best friends.

16:44.102 --> 16:45.602
I don't want to
speak for Leonard.

16:45.604 --> 16:46.636
Thank you. I...

16:46.638 --> 16:47.637
But when
you're insecure,

16:47.639 --> 16:49.239
no amount
of external validation

16:49.241 --> 16:51.431
can ever make you
feel safe.

16:51.455 --> 16:53.209
Yeah, you're right. You know,
you're really sensitive

16:53.211 --> 16:54.811
about this
kind of stuff.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.747
I'm a good listener.
(chuckles) Yeah.

16:57.749 --> 16:59.516
Hey, Olsen twins...

17:01.353 --> 17:02.485
What?

17:02.487 --> 17:04.921
Well, I-I mean, I'm
sitting right here.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.289
You're talking about my feelings

17:06.290 --> 17:08.558
and somehow leaving me
out of the conversation.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.926
I'm sorry.
What did you want to say?

17:10.929 --> 17:13.997
I don't know,
you pretty much covered it.

17:13.999 --> 17:17.267

Excellent. Excellent.
