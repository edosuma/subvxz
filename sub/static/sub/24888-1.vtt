00:28.629 --> 00:29.895
Mom!

00:30.998 --> 00:32.531
How was your shift?

00:32.633 --> 00:35.167
Ugh. Long.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.437
Boring.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.705
I'm tired.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.973
I got you guys hamburgers.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.208
With sweet potato fries?

00:43.310 --> 00:46.445
Heh. Yes, a double
order, of course.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.913
Bless you.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.149
Showed three houses on
the west side today.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.884
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.152
Well, just start without me.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.787
I'm gonna have a
quick shower, okay?

00:54.889 --> 00:57.689
Before you race off, you might
want to check the table.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.632
Aren't you going to open it?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.067
I can't. Can you?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.435
Go on.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.236
What if I didn't get
a high enough score

01:11.338 --> 01:13.005
to get into any law school?

01:13.107 --> 01:14.773
Then you'll try again.

01:14.875 --> 01:18.343
It took your father three tries
before he passed his LSATs.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.917
160.

01:26.357 --> 01:27.397
It just doesn't feel right

01:27.421 --> 01:28.687
celebrating without Dad.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.423
I know. Once the
Manzotti case is over,

01:31.525 --> 01:34.159
maybe we could convince him
to take some time off.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.039
The three of us could
take a little vacation

01:36.063 --> 01:38.831
before you head off
to law school.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.968
Maybe he had a
break in the case.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.169
Okay, you wait here.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.914
Nick?

01:58.252 --> 02:00.185
Laura, there's been an accident.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.622
What happened?

02:03.724 --> 02:04.990
Is he okay?

02:05.092 --> 02:06.658
Let's step inside.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.259
No.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.653
Damn it.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.497
I forgot my... I left my...

02:45.599 --> 02:47.332
I couldn't find my house...
The key.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.067
I think I left it at the bar.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.669
How much have you had to drink?

02:50.771 --> 02:52.004
Mmm...

02:52.106 --> 02:53.872
I don't know.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.574
Where is your car?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.176
Did Ethan drive you home?

02:57.278 --> 02:59.356
- You know how I feel about him.
- Yes, Mom, I know.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.180
The whole town knows how
you feel about Ethan.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.415
No, I walked home from the bar,

03:03.517 --> 03:05.784
because I'm a responsible adult.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.753
Natalie, you have to
get yourself together.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.688
It's been almost a year,
and you're still...

03:09.790 --> 03:11.623
Still what? I am getting
myself together.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.560
Me hanging out with my friends
is getting myself together.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.195
Okay? It's better than, what,

03:16.257 --> 03:18.177
going to sleep with dad's
case files every night?

03:18.201 --> 03:20.632
What are you even
hoping to find?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.234
I'm trying to help you.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.036
I don't need your help, okay?

03:24.116 --> 03:26.316
You're the one who can't even
close the deal on a house.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.273
You're all like, "Hey, do
you wanna buy a house?"

03:28.375 --> 03:30.309
It comes with a conspiracy theory.
Do you care?"

03:30.411 --> 03:34.246
I mean, that's weird, Mom.
You're the one who needs help!

03:34.348 --> 03:35.581
Laura.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.249
Hey, is everything okay?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.786
Yes. Thank you, Betty.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.988
She's so annoying.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.990
She needs to mind
her own business.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.503
Natalie, if you're
gonna stay here,

03:46.527 --> 03:47.659
you cannot act like this.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.127
It's embarrassing
for both of us.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.910
Oh, it's embarrassing?
You know what, then?

03:50.934 --> 03:52.397
In the morning, I won't be here.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.067
I'll be gone, and you can just
live here alone in the past.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.802
It's your dream situation.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.971
That's not what I meant.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.608
This isn't over, Natalie.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.143
Oh. Found them,

04:05.246 --> 04:07.980
so it is.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.583
Goodbye, Mom!

05:25.492 --> 05:26.758
Mom?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.331
Mom?

05:36.337 --> 05:37.602
Mom?!

05:40.841 --> 05:42.474
Mom?!

05:47.848 --> 05:48.880
Mom?!

05:54.655 --> 05:56.221
Appears to be a break-in, Chief.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.889
Window over there is smashed.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.759
Best we can figure is it
was a burglary gone wrong.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.060
Vic came into the kitchen,

06:02.162 --> 06:03.295
scared 'em in the act.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.262
They panicked.

06:04.365 --> 06:07.032
Oh, Laura, I'm so sorry.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.302
There's no jewelry.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.539
Looks like they yanked it
right off of her neck.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.550
She has a daughter, Natalie.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.252
I'm a friend of the family,

06:27.354 --> 06:30.088
so I should probably call
her and break the bad news.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.591
Uh, sir, Monroe's got
her out back right now.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.226
She was upstairs
when it happened.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.161
She's the one that called it in.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.165
I want a report on
my desk A.S.A.P.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.969
Make sure you get a picture
of the neck and the wrist.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.103
Yes, sir.

06:49.376 --> 06:53.145
And what time did you
go to bed last night?

06:53.247 --> 06:56.948
Um, I don't remember, 'cause
I wasn't feeling very well.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.184
And as far as you
know, did your mother

06:59.286 --> 07:00.819
have any, uh, plans
for last night?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.587
Was she going to have
anybody else over?

07:02.689 --> 07:07.826
No, sh-she didn't talk to
anybody like that since...

07:10.431 --> 07:11.841
My God, Nick. Thank
God you're here.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.865
You have to find
out who did this.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.534
I mean, who would
do this to her?

07:15.636 --> 07:16.835
I know, Natalie. I know.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.603
- Monroe.
- Chief.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.417
I just have a few more
questions for her, and then...

07:20.441 --> 07:22.107
You know, I would
appreciate it if you'd

07:22.209 --> 07:23.769
go and ask the neighbors
some questions.

07:23.793 --> 07:25.893
See if they have
anything to add.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.587
Nat...

07:37.524 --> 07:42.828
I can't even begin to imagine
what you're going through,

07:42.930 --> 07:45.130
but if you're up for it,

07:45.232 --> 07:46.798
you know, any little detail

07:46.900 --> 07:49.534
may very well help us
catch who killed her.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.508
Your car isn't here.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.076
Is it possible that whoever...

07:58.178 --> 08:00.412
I walked home. I...

08:00.514 --> 08:02.280
I'd had a bit to drink.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.683
My mom let me in,

08:04.785 --> 08:07.018
and then we talked for a bit,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.588
- and then I went to bed.
- And after that?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.023
Did you hear anything?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.559
Any noises? Any voices?

08:15.963 --> 08:18.630
I-I guess I'd had
a little bit more

08:18.732 --> 08:21.233
than a little bit to drink.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.736
You have somebody to call?

08:24.838 --> 08:28.507
Someplace safe that
you can go tonight?

08:28.609 --> 08:33.245
I could call Ethan, but, uh...

08:33.347 --> 08:34.712
Don't worry.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.780
I know the folks that
own the Sleep 'n Stay.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.149
They'll put you up.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.086
Natalie, I'm not going to rest

08:41.188 --> 08:44.756
until I know who did this.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.491
I promise.

09:09.650 --> 09:13.618
Oh, okay. So I wasn't sure
exactly what to get, so...

09:13.720 --> 09:15.720
kinda got everything.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.290
Um, toothbrush and shampoo.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.791
You need towels,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.793
because I don't trust the
ones in that bathroom.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.329
Oh, and I know you said
you weren't hungry,

09:24.431 --> 09:26.276
but I always say that,

09:26.300 --> 09:28.800
and then I end up
wishing I had food.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.973
You, uh, gonna answer that?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.976
No, because it's Ethan, and I
don't want to talk to him.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.578
Ugh. Hallelujah.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.614
I was worried your moment
of clarity last night

09:42.716 --> 09:44.683
would have faded away, but...

09:44.785 --> 09:46.918
well, I never liked him.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.787
Yeah, you made that very clear,

09:48.889 --> 09:51.056
you and my mom both.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.571
Shelby, what am I gonna do?

10:07.874 --> 10:10.141
I don't have anyone left.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.276
Hey...

10:11.378 --> 10:15.113
come on. That's not true.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.716
When my dad died,
I was devastated,

10:17.818 --> 10:20.051
and I kept thinking,
"This is so unfair,"

10:20.153 --> 10:23.989
but accidents happen, and...

10:24.091 --> 10:25.523
now with both of them gone,

10:25.626 --> 10:27.403
I feel like it's like
some cosmic punishment,

10:27.427 --> 10:29.461
and I don't know what
I did to deserve it.

10:29.563 --> 10:30.729
Nothing.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.331
Hey, you did nothing.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.134
I just need to leave town, I
think, after the funeral.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.402
I can't... I can't be here.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.870
I can't live in that house.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.238
You can't just run away

10:40.340 --> 10:41.840
from what you're
feeling, Natalie.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.642
I know you know that.

10:43.704 --> 10:45.944
But my mom, even after the
accident, she wanted me to go.

10:45.968 --> 10:47.728
She was like, "Even if
you aren't in school",

10:47.752 --> 10:49.926
I think it would be good for
you to clear your head."

10:49.950 --> 10:51.928
- But that... that wasn't...
- I know. She was mad

10:51.952 --> 10:53.351
that you convinced me to stay.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.919
No, she was wrong.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.961
If you'd gone,

11:03.063 --> 11:05.797
you might have missed your
last months together with her.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.167
Or maybe not.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.936
But you can't know that.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.845
I'm all alone.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.419
No, you're not.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.891
But what you probably are is...
is hungry,

11:32.993 --> 11:35.560
so come to the bar.
I've got a shift,

11:35.662 --> 11:38.830
and I know that you could use
a tray of comfort fries.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.835
No, not tonight. I'm good.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.411
If it tastes like there's
no rum in that one,

11:53.513 --> 11:55.447
it's because there isn't.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.349
We don't want a repeat of last week?
Do we, Norris?

12:02.556 --> 12:05.457
And speaking of
unwelcome repeats...

12:05.559 --> 12:06.658
Where is she, Shelby?

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
Not here,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.227
and neither should you be.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.229
- Don't lie to me.
- Okay.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.997
You're a creep, and
you should leave.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.933
Her car is outside, Shelby.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.468
You can't try and tell...

12:16.570 --> 12:19.437
Because she walked home,
just like you should.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.984
Okay? You don't want to wreck
that pretty little car of yours.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.842
- But my phone won't...
- Your phone?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.643
Okay, you're right. I was wrong.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.113
You're not a creep.
You're a super creep,

12:28.215 --> 12:32.317
and you don't work here, so
get out from behind the bar.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.019
I-I just want to make
sure she's okay.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.623
Of course she's not.
Her mother died.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.626
I-I want her to know
that I'm here for her.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.994
Wonderful.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.096
But not here, okay?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.368
Natalie needs me,

12:50.470 --> 12:52.003
and you know why?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.906
Because I'm the only one who
treats her like an adult.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.645
Yeah, real adult.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.213
I'm about to get Rudy,

13:02.315 --> 13:04.716
and I don't think he's
gonna be as nice to you

13:04.818 --> 13:06.117
as he was last night.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.820
I hope you and Rudy and everyone

13:08.922 --> 13:12.857
understands that she
needs me, okay?

13:13.927 --> 13:15.093
She needs me.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.739
Well, that was fun.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.974
Thanks for the help, guys.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.277
All right, who wants a shot?

13:32.379 --> 13:34.078
Bit of rum, please.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.820
Natalie, so sorry for your loss.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.703
Poor girl.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.427
Your mom was a great woman.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.362
Mm-hmm.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.043
Honey, I'm gonna go...

14:49.089 --> 14:52.423
Chief, it's good to see you.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.459
- Just paying my respects.
- I know.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.394
I know what's up.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.062
Okay. What's up?

14:58.164 --> 15:00.231
You're looking for the killer.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.600
I heard they always come
to their victim's funeral.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.769
Yeah, I don't think that's true.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.204
Well, don't worry. I'll stand...

15:07.507 --> 15:09.407
Think you could do
me a favor, Chief?

15:12.245 --> 15:13.778
Who's the guy in the car?

15:13.880 --> 15:17.115
Ethan, Natalie's ex.
Super creeper.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.318
And look where he is.
Just saying.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.388
I got him.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.863
Bye, Ethan.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.113
E-Excuse me.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.381
Um, would it be cliché

15:50.483 --> 15:52.116
to ask you if you
come here often?

15:52.218 --> 15:53.629
It's not a line.
I'm just wondering

15:53.653 --> 15:55.119
if you know what's good here.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.956
The alcohol.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.290
It's a bit early for me.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.993
All right. Suit yourself.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.861
Hey. Can I help you?

16:03.964 --> 16:07.365
Uh, yeah. Um, can I get
a burger, medium rare,

16:07.467 --> 16:11.169
and a refill for
whatever she's having?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.371
Oh, it's okay. You don't
have to buy me a drink.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.540
Oh, I know, but I heard
they're really good here.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.742
Who told you that?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.243
Hey, Rudy,

16:19.346 --> 16:21.212
uh, can you add a side
of sweet potato fries

16:21.314 --> 16:22.314
- to his order?
- Sure.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.084
They're worth the whole trip.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.885
Uh, thanks.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.655
Play your cards right, I might
even share 'em with you.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.059
So is this a-an
everyday look for you?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.565
Not that you look bad.

16:36.589 --> 16:38.309
I mean, you look really beautiful.
I just...

16:38.333 --> 16:40.600
Was my mother's funeral today.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.336
I-I'm sorry.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.604
It's okay. You didn't know.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.774
Still, uh, I'm sorry, Natalie.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.576
Do they, uh, serve
good apologies here?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.077
I never told you my name.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.380
You didn't? Oh.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.382
Well, um, I think Rudy said it.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.017
- No.
- It was Natalie, wasn't it?

16:59.119 --> 17:00.985
No? Oh, then, what is it?

17:06.159 --> 17:08.425
I-I know who you are,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.128
but if you'll just listen to me.
My name is Brody,

17:11.231 --> 17:14.531
Brody Long. I'm a... I'm a
writer, a crime writer.

17:14.594 --> 17:17.034
I'd really like to talk about
everything that's been going on.

17:17.058 --> 17:18.191
I knew your father.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.040
Before he died, I
was writing a book

17:22.142 --> 17:23.608
about the case he
was working on,

17:23.710 --> 17:25.810
the Manzotti family ties
to organized crime.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.811
I reached out to your mother...

17:27.874 --> 17:30.314
Oh, but now they're dead, so you
need a new source to exploit?

17:30.338 --> 17:31.582
No. I... Look, I want to help,

17:31.684 --> 17:33.151
if you'd just hear me out.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.753
Look, I know you have
no reason to trust me,

17:35.855 --> 17:37.488
but trust this.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.491
You're in danger.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.630
Stay away from me.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.818
Right there.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.887
<i>Oh, God. Mom, I'm so sorry.</i>

18:09.989 --> 18:11.856
She said it away from the phone.

18:11.918 --> 18:14.518
I don't think she realized it would
be picked up by the recording.

18:14.542 --> 18:19.130
Monroe, people react to
trauma in all kinds of ways.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.399
You can't take "I'm sorry"

18:21.501 --> 18:23.067
as an admission of guilt.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.902
There's more. Some
drawers were opened,

18:25.004 --> 18:26.471
some were dumped
out on the ground,

18:26.573 --> 18:28.539
and then there's this
table lying on its side,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.375
but what's weird
here are the chairs.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.178
If someone was looking for
something and panicked,

18:34.280 --> 18:35.480
it would have been impulsive,

18:35.582 --> 18:36.902
so the chairs would
have scattered

18:36.926 --> 18:38.149
when the table was flipped,

18:38.251 --> 18:39.971
but these look like
they've been pulled out,

18:39.995 --> 18:41.395
- suggesting that...
- "Suggesting"?

18:42.455 --> 18:45.690
You're suggesting
that this is staged.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.859
The only items that are missing

18:47.961 --> 18:50.928
are a wedding ring and a
necklace, both on her person.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.498
No other attempt
to loot the house.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.111
Maybe that's when
he was interrupted.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.234
Or she.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.038
You heard what Natalie said.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.175
Hell, we knew Laura.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.911
I mean, the woman was harmless.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.246
If you can see a motive

19:08.348 --> 19:10.548
beyond her big house
and her nice car,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.216
then I'd appreciate
if you'd share it.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.986
It just seems odd that Natalie
didn't hear anything.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.388
If a table is thrown
across the room...

19:21.828 --> 19:24.195
it's kinda hard not to hear it.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.202
She was drunk.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.437
And that makes her
less of a suspect?

19:33.540 --> 19:36.607
Look, I know you have a personal
relationship with this family,

19:36.709 --> 19:39.110
but this is worth pursuing.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.212
It may be nothing, but...

19:41.314 --> 19:43.781
I have questions.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.721
Okay.

20:03.180 --> 20:04.180
Nick.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.436
Did you find him?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.071
No, not yet.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.140
I just wanted to check on you.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.441
Tried calling.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.809
Yeah, my phone's been off.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.945
I'm not really in a chatty mood.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.180
Well, yeah. Understand that.

20:16.282 --> 20:19.450
Well, I'm sorry that I can't
be the bearer of good news,

20:19.552 --> 20:21.752
but I can be the
bearer of lunch.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.055
It's from Rudy's, so...

20:25.425 --> 20:27.325
Thank you for this.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.843
Nat, I know this is a lot.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.947
I hope you know that we're
doing all that we can.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.451
We're looking into
every possibility.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.988
Actually that's the other
reason I stopped by.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.324
Um, a few days, I'm gonna
need you to come in

21:00.426 --> 21:03.027
and answer a few more
questions, just a formality.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.630
Okay, yeah, but I already
told you everything I know.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.898
I know. Like I said, formality.

21:08.001 --> 21:11.636
Do you think this could have something
to do with my father's death?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.904
I mean, do you think
they could be connected?

21:23.349 --> 21:24.448
Look, Nat...

21:25.585 --> 21:27.585
when your dad died,

21:27.687 --> 21:30.821
all I could think was,
"No, no, not Andy,

21:30.923 --> 21:34.558
not like this. It's
not an accident."

21:36.296 --> 21:38.162
But it was.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.407
Yeah, my mom never
believed that.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.776
She said the Manzottis
were the kind of people

21:51.878 --> 21:54.478
that could shut somebody
up if they wanted to.

21:54.580 --> 21:59.517
None of us believed that your
dad had started drinking again,

21:59.619 --> 22:02.520
but the toxicology
report was pretty clear.

22:05.191 --> 22:06.857
I'm not trying to upset you.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.260
We need to get into the future,

22:09.362 --> 22:11.896
and we don't do that by
dwelling in the past, do we?

22:11.998 --> 22:15.599
So you do me a favor, and
you stay in the present.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.468
Mm-hmm.

22:18.805 --> 22:22.973
Okay. You call if
you need anything.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.250
Oh. I'm sorry.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.327
Why are you ignoring me?

24:26.265 --> 24:29.166
Ethan, how did you get in here?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.635
Door was cracked.

24:34.207 --> 24:36.340
Oh, I-I brought you these.

24:36.442 --> 24:39.410
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.278
I know you were there.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.347
I mean, to see if you were okay,

24:43.449 --> 24:46.784
but your control-freak friend
unleashed that cop on me.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.919
I-I just wanted to
pay my respects.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.722
No, you didn't.
You hated my mom.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.059
Doesn't mean I can't feel bad.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.695
I mean, it's not like
I wanted her dead.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.373
I didn't kill her.

25:09.475 --> 25:12.776
You can't really
think I killed her.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.078
I believe you.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.113
I don't want you to
just believe me.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.482
- I want you to trust me.
- I do. I... Same thing.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.518
No, Natalie, it isn't.

25:22.488 --> 25:23.921
Hey, don't shut me out.

25:27.894 --> 25:30.895
I-I didn't mean to.

25:30.997 --> 25:35.132
Ethan, do you want
me to trust you?

25:35.234 --> 25:38.335
I-I just need some space, okay?

25:46.245 --> 25:47.511
Fine.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.787
<i>Stop me if I start to go astray.</i>

25:56.889 --> 25:58.433
You went to Rudy's
at about 6:00 p.m.,

25:58.457 --> 26:00.190
not for work, but for
a drink with friends,

26:00.293 --> 26:02.092
and at 9:15, you walked home,

26:02.194 --> 26:04.439
where you were greeted on the
front porch by your mother,

26:04.463 --> 26:05.863
and you two had a fight.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.098
Well, I wouldn't say
it was a fight.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.168
We spoke with your neighbor,
Betty Ledbetter, and she stated

26:11.270 --> 26:14.190
that you were yelling so loudly she
could hear you from across the street.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.840
You had an argument, right?

26:18.377 --> 26:21.111
Did you have these
arguments regularly?

26:22.582 --> 26:24.315
What does this have to
do with the break-in?

26:24.417 --> 26:25.772
- It doesn't.
- You were the

26:25.784 --> 26:27.151
last person to see her alive.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.120
The details of that interaction
are extremely pertinent.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.388
Hey.

26:35.294 --> 26:39.563
Did you recently come back
from a trip, a vacation?

26:39.665 --> 26:41.198
- Were you planning one?
- No.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.133
You had a suitcase
out in your room

26:43.235 --> 26:45.113
that was hurriedly packed
from the looks of it.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.571
If you didn't have any plans,
what were you packing for?

26:53.212 --> 26:56.413
I don't think I want to answer
any more questions right now.

27:01.120 --> 27:05.623
Um, Detective, why don't you get
Natalie a little more water.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.157
Please?

27:21.107 --> 27:24.775
This is uncomfortable,
I know, Natalie.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.277
Does she think that I was
involved or something?

27:27.380 --> 27:28.912
We have to be thorough

27:29.015 --> 27:31.682
so we make sure that we
don't overlook anything.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.751
That would have been
nice a year ago.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.221
Fair.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.189
So let's say your mom was right.

27:40.559 --> 27:43.127
Let's assume that
we missed something

27:43.229 --> 27:44.949
in the investigation of
your father's death.

27:44.973 --> 27:47.173
We don't really want that
to happen again, do we?

27:48.134 --> 27:49.733
Then I need you to trust me.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.669
Yeah, everybody wants
me to trust them,

27:51.771 --> 27:53.203
but nobody trusts me.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.941
Have you talked to Ethan?

27:58.044 --> 27:59.143
Your ex?

27:59.245 --> 28:00.811
You should.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.647
He was really drunk that
night, and he was angry,

28:03.749 --> 28:07.151
and he did not like my mom at
all, and he was at the funeral,

28:07.253 --> 28:08.952
which Shelby says is
like a very common...

28:09.055 --> 28:13.123
Yes. I know what Shelby says.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.592
And I told her,
"You know, Crystal,

28:15.695 --> 28:18.429
real producers
don't use Tinder,"

28:18.531 --> 28:20.164
at least not in the casting.

28:22.001 --> 28:24.601
But guess what. Now she's
in some huge monster movie,

28:24.704 --> 28:26.937
so what do I know?

28:27.039 --> 28:28.105
Hey. See you later, Rudy.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.640
See you, Shelby.

28:29.742 --> 28:32.743
It's Shelby, right?

28:32.845 --> 28:33.977
Uh, it is,

28:34.080 --> 28:35.512
but I'm off duty.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.781
If you are, too, uh,
drinks are over there,

28:37.883 --> 28:40.184
and Rudy will take care of you.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.252
If not, Natalie's not here,

28:42.354 --> 28:43.354
and also she's grieving,

28:43.456 --> 28:45.022
so how 'bout give it a break?

28:45.124 --> 28:46.523
I'm looking for Ethan James.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.592
I was told I could
find him here.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.194
Not anymore, you can't.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.329
Rudy finally kicked him
out a few nights ago

28:52.431 --> 28:53.997
and the night before that.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.834
Drunk and belligerent
both times.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.936
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

28:59.038 --> 29:01.038
Yeah. Right over there.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.174
He's been brooding on the nearest
strip of public property

29:04.276 --> 29:06.510
just itching to catch
Natalie out and about.

29:06.612 --> 29:10.280
He's the one who's about
yay high and yay douchey.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.382
Got it.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.053
Ethan James...

29:35.074 --> 29:38.408
Ugh. This is the worst idea.

29:38.511 --> 29:40.110
Yeah, I know it seems weird,

29:40.212 --> 29:42.045
but I read that the
healthiest thing to do

29:42.148 --> 29:44.982
is separate yourself
from material residue.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.818
What does that even mean?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.553
I'm not sure.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.455
Look, there is a lot of
stuff in this house,

29:51.557 --> 29:53.090
and with it sitting here empty,

29:53.192 --> 29:55.959
what if the robber comes back?

29:56.061 --> 29:57.728
So you agree that it's a robber?

29:57.830 --> 29:59.229
'Cause the police
don't seem sure.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.332
I mean, yeah. Who
else would it be?

30:02.434 --> 30:03.901
Who do they think it is?

30:04.003 --> 30:05.335
They don't know.

30:05.437 --> 30:07.337
Well, that's the problem
with the police.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.274
Never sure...

30:10.376 --> 30:11.909
What was that?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.984
Someone's in here.

30:16.008 --> 30:17.768
I heard that criminals
often return to the...

30:18.677 --> 30:19.917
Okay, we're calling the police.

30:19.941 --> 30:21.785
No, no, no, no, no. Wait.

30:21.887 --> 30:22.920
Wait.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.978
What are you doing here?!

30:48.080 --> 30:49.880
Do you know this guy?

30:49.982 --> 30:53.283
Yes. It's that "writer" guy
I was telling you about.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.485
Oh, him.

30:55.588 --> 30:57.621
Yeah, him, I think.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.056
Uh, what's with the air quotes?

30:59.158 --> 31:00.691
- I'm published.
- So what?

31:00.793 --> 31:02.659
I thought she told
you to stay away.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.195
Yeah, and I did.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.865
You're in my house right now.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.867
Hey! Stop that.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.289
You're disturbing
the crime scene.

31:11.313 --> 31:12.502
Calm down, CSI.

31:12.605 --> 31:15.639
The real police have
already been over it.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.574
And speaking of, Natalie,

31:17.676 --> 31:19.710
I still think we should
give them a call.

31:19.812 --> 31:20.878
No, you shouldn't.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.980
I'm sorry. Is your name Natalie?

31:23.082 --> 31:24.581
You had a meeting
with them, right?

31:25.951 --> 31:27.271
And let me guess.
They're starting

31:27.373 --> 31:28.417
to ask a lot of questions

31:28.441 --> 31:29.653
about how you and your mom

31:29.755 --> 31:31.235
got in a big fight
the night she died,

31:31.259 --> 31:32.723
how the neighbors heard.

31:32.825 --> 31:34.758
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

31:34.860 --> 31:37.427
I know they don't have a
suspect or a murder weapon.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.763
- They're looking.
- Yeah...

31:39.865 --> 31:41.231
at you.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.033
'Cause when they don't
have a suspect,

31:43.135 --> 31:44.268
they invent one.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.238
Now, I don't have
a suspect either,

31:48.340 --> 31:50.173
but I do have a weapon.

31:50.276 --> 31:53.176
Your mom was a big
reader, right?

31:53.279 --> 31:54.411
I figured.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.780
Great collection.

31:56.882 --> 31:59.449
And what's missing
from this bookshelf?

31:59.551 --> 32:00.751
What?

32:00.853 --> 32:02.252
One of your books?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.491
What's that?

32:08.827 --> 32:11.161
This is a start.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.838
There were two of these.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.307
Obviously.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.087
When you say you want an ending,

32:37.189 --> 32:38.789
I hope you mean a happy one.

32:38.891 --> 32:41.158
Well, yeah. I'm not keen
on the sort of stories

32:41.260 --> 32:43.794
where the heroes get shot
and dumped in the bay.

32:43.896 --> 32:46.897
I mean, they sell,
but I want answers.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.099
Did you know your
<i>Deadly Affair</i> book

32:49.201 --> 32:52.002
only has a 2 1/2 star
rating on Goodreads?

32:52.104 --> 32:53.804
It was my first book.

32:53.906 --> 32:57.407
NovelGal54 says it's
boring and predictable.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.614
Why not let the police
just find the answers?

32:59.638 --> 33:01.398
- There's the ones...
- They said your father

33:01.422 --> 33:02.854
had been drinking.
You believe that?

33:04.350 --> 33:05.393
No.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.750
Neither do I.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.332
They settled for the
easy explanation.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.020
I don't want to see
the same mistake

33:10.122 --> 33:12.322
get made again, if
it was a mistake.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.758
Why, 'cause easy explanations
don't make for good books?

33:14.860 --> 33:16.994
No, because easy explanations
reek of laziness,

33:17.096 --> 33:18.996
and laziness is the
enemy of justice.

33:19.098 --> 33:23.367
Really? I heard that "the
mystery is the best part",

33:23.469 --> 33:26.837
and the beginning and
conclusion is ho-hum."

33:26.939 --> 33:28.005
I've gotten better.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.351
Hey, I don't write the reviews.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.608
I just read them aloud.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.813
I think we're good on our own.

33:38.984 --> 33:40.283
Suit yourself.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.691
But a word of warning.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.126
Your dad was investigating

33:49.228 --> 33:51.395
some very dangerous
people before he died.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.631
Your mom may have been killed 'cause
she was considered a loose end.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.600
What are you saying?

33:58.103 --> 34:01.772
I'm saying you might
be a loose end, too.

34:01.874 --> 34:04.741
And loose ends meet bad ends.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.353
That's the end of that.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.554
You think so?

34:17.656 --> 34:19.089
No, hell, no.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.891
I have read too much
pulpy crime fiction

34:20.993 --> 34:23.592
to think we've seen the
end of Brody Long.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.062
But when we do see him again,

34:25.164 --> 34:27.264
don't tell him I
read that trash.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.402
Yeah, I just wish
they cuffed him.

34:32.504 --> 34:36.406
But, no, he just followed him
in that stupid yellow ride.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.876
If they were charging him,
they would have told me.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.878
Who do you think's gonna
pop back up first,

34:41.980 --> 34:43.914
- Ethan or Brody?
- I have no idea.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.283
I would not be
surprised at all if...

34:46.385 --> 34:48.217
God. That was quick.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.954
- We told you no.
- Yeah, I-I heard that.

34:51.056 --> 34:54.224
But you listened to us even less
than you listen to your editors.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.793
Um, no.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.295
Um, well, maybe,

34:58.397 --> 35:00.897
but also, uh...

35:00.999 --> 35:02.833
this is my room.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.822
I'm headed out.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.058
Call if you come up with
anything that holds water.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.160
Will do.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.941
Thing about comfort food is
it only works if you eat it.

35:45.043 --> 35:48.812
Heh. I know. I just don't
really wanna be comforted.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.834
I got a little too comfortable
after my dad died,

35:50.916 --> 35:52.415
and look where that got me.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.684
This place isn't so bad.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.453
The fries are delicious.

35:56.555 --> 35:59.089
And free for employees.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.496
Okay, let's play a game.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.743
I know what you're doing and that
you're trying to distract me,

36:08.767 --> 36:10.133
but I don't wanna be distracted.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.302
I think I just need to
process everything.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.337
I know. It's about that.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.341
- What, like <i> Clue?</i>
- No.

36:18.443 --> 36:21.344
Well, actually, yeah, kinda.

36:21.446 --> 36:25.448
Let's say we were in
a Brody Long novel.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.284
Who are the possible suspects,

36:27.386 --> 36:29.953
and what are their motives?

36:30.055 --> 36:31.922
Okay. Um...

36:33.492 --> 36:34.891
Ethan.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.893
My mom was trying to
keep me away from him.

36:36.995 --> 36:40.030
Good. Too obvious, but good.

36:40.132 --> 36:41.831
What about Brody?

36:41.934 --> 36:45.035
The case was cold, and he
had to force it to reopen?

36:46.738 --> 36:48.238
The police?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.307
Maybe my mom proved
that they botched

36:50.409 --> 36:51.741
the investigation of my dad,

36:51.843 --> 36:53.476
and that could be embarrassing.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.378
Would Nick allow that?

36:55.480 --> 36:58.381
I don't know. We're open to
every possibility, right?

36:58.483 --> 37:01.518
Okay. Me.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.020
Your mom was trying to convince
you to go to law school,

37:04.122 --> 37:06.623
and I would have
missed you too much.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.493
Or me.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.197
Inheritance?

37:14.299 --> 37:15.565
What? No. I was...

37:15.667 --> 37:17.100
I was gonna say drunken fight,

37:17.202 --> 37:18.535
but is that what you think...

37:18.637 --> 37:20.370
Is that why you wanted
to play this game?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.472
No, I wasn't...

37:22.874 --> 37:24.507
It's just a stupid game.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.778
Yeah, it's really stupid.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.449
And it's probably just a robber.

37:33.619 --> 37:34.718
Maybe.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.153
I mean, who else could it be?

37:41.393 --> 37:44.261
<i>You know, it's just
really hard to say.</i>

37:44.363 --> 37:46.763
I only wish I had paid
a bit more attention.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.766
I think I told you
before I always felt

37:49.868 --> 37:53.003
like a real closeness
to that family.

37:53.105 --> 37:54.304
Yeah, you mentioned that.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.917
Not like I was
actually a part of it.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.707
I mean, Laura was her mother,

37:57.809 --> 38:00.210
and let me tell you,
she was a saint.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.711
Yep. You mentioned that...

38:01.813 --> 38:03.680
The way Natalie would
speak to her sometimes,

38:03.782 --> 38:06.249
I would never...

38:06.351 --> 38:09.853
But I cared.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.291
Uh, you wrote that down, right?

38:14.393 --> 38:15.625
- Uh, yep.
- Oh, you got it?

38:15.727 --> 38:17.527
Got it all right here. Bye.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.996
I wish I could help.
I really do,

38:20.098 --> 38:22.899
but I think she always
found me kind of...

38:23.001 --> 38:24.901
annoying.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.670
I find that hard to believe.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.005
Anyways, thank you so
much for your time.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.373
Oh, my pleasure.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.035
And if you do find
that copy of my book,

38:32.059 --> 38:33.910
I'd be happy to come back
and sign it for you.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.679
Oh, absolutely. It
was a pleasure.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.861
- Always nice to meet a fan.
- Nice to meet you, too.

38:37.885 --> 38:39.184
Good luck!

38:41.453 --> 38:42.652
Hmm.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.056
Afternoon, Mrs. Ledbetter.

38:46.158 --> 38:49.225
Chief Nick. Nice to see you.

38:49.328 --> 38:50.593
Is Natalie doing all right?

38:50.696 --> 38:51.995
Oh, all things considered.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.265
Betty, I had a few
follow-up questions,

38:55.367 --> 38:57.600
but if you don't mind
me asking, who's that?

38:57.703 --> 38:59.202
Oh, him?

38:59.304 --> 39:01.771
Ah, he's a true-crime novelist

39:01.873 --> 39:05.775
in town covering Laura
Romero's murder.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.578
Seems a little sweet on Natalie.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.681
You know, he knew Mr. Romero.

39:11.783 --> 39:15.885
Apparently he was working
on a book about him, too.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.088
Really hope this book's
better than his last.

39:18.190 --> 39:21.191
It was a real...
snoozefest, you know?

39:21.293 --> 39:22.293
Mm.

39:24.296 --> 39:26.062
Excuse me.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.931
Had the nosy neighbor only been

39:28.033 --> 39:31.301
as attentive through the night
as she was to the fight,

39:31.403 --> 39:33.370
might she have se...

39:35.474 --> 39:37.607
"Night," "fight"...

39:37.709 --> 39:39.142
"might."

39:43.215 --> 39:45.415
Is there a problem, Chief?

39:45.517 --> 39:47.851
I don't know. Might be.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.054
Did you know that you
could be charged

39:51.156 --> 39:52.889
with obstruction of justice

39:52.991 --> 39:55.058
for threatening or interfering
with the witnesses

39:55.160 --> 39:56.559
of an ongoing investigation?

39:56.661 --> 39:59.562
Uh, just asking questions.

39:59.664 --> 40:02.499
For your book?

40:02.601 --> 40:03.967
For my book.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.402
See, that's the thing.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.404
This murder isn't a story.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.805
It isn't entertainment.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.942
Lot of people were hurt by it,

40:13.044 --> 40:17.847
people that are and
were very dear to me,

40:17.949 --> 40:20.917
and I just don't take
kindly to other people

40:21.019 --> 40:24.320
trying to exploit that pain.

40:24.423 --> 40:26.489
Making myself clear, right?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.158
I think so.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.026
I think we want the
same thing here,

40:30.128 --> 40:32.662
for justice to be served and
to honor Andrea Romero.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.932
No, we don't want
the same thing.

40:36.034 --> 40:40.236
See, you want to protect
your Amazon sales.

40:40.338 --> 40:45.975
I want to protect grieving
survivors from your harassment.

40:46.077 --> 40:49.412
What I don't want...

40:49.514 --> 40:51.181
is to see you around
this town again.

40:54.719 --> 40:55.885
Drive safe.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.208
Ethan, what are you doing?

41:18.310 --> 41:20.376
What are you telling
the police about me?

41:20.479 --> 41:23.213
- Nothing!
- They came to talk to me.

41:23.315 --> 41:26.149
They wanted to know where I was
the night your mother died.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.011
They're talking to
everyone that's connected.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.820
Oh, so... so now I'm connected?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.222
You were with me the...

41:32.324 --> 41:33.923
Don't lie to me, Natalie!

41:34.025 --> 41:36.059
Everything okay?

41:37.629 --> 41:39.329
Ah.

41:39.431 --> 41:41.798
Oh, so I guess it's you.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.101
I guess you're what
needing space looks like.

41:47.138 --> 41:48.649
Well, I hope she's
warned you, buddy,

41:48.673 --> 41:50.440
but people that
get close to her,

41:50.542 --> 41:52.041
they don't last very long.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.710
Better you than me.

41:53.812 --> 41:54.812
Good luck.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.786
You good?

42:03.889 --> 42:04.921
Yeah.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.724
I assume he's a suspect, right?

42:11.663 --> 42:13.596
And now he's been
threatening me.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.765
Threatening you? How's that?

42:15.867 --> 42:17.567
I mean, he showed
up at my motel.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.135
He showed up at my car.

42:19.215 --> 42:21.015
I thought you said you
were gonna talk to him.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.872
I did. He's not the
most stand-up guy,

42:22.974 --> 42:25.542
but he has an alibi for the time
of death, and it checks out,

42:25.644 --> 42:27.877
so as far as we're concerned,
he's not a suspect.

42:27.979 --> 42:31.114
But if you feel
threatened, we can...

42:31.216 --> 42:33.216
No, no. It's... It's okay.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.585
Thank you for your time.

42:35.687 --> 42:38.454
Actually, Natalie, uh,
I'm glad you stopped by.

42:38.557 --> 42:40.390
There's something I
wanted to run by you.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.763
Okay, well, do I need a lawyer?

42:46.865 --> 42:48.665
You're entitled to
one if you want.

42:48.767 --> 42:49.799
It's up to you.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.101
No, it's fine. What is it?

42:52.203 --> 42:54.237
I've been reviewing
your statement,

42:54.339 --> 42:57.106
and you said that you came
home and went straight to bed.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.309
Is that correct?

42:59.411 --> 43:01.744
I mean, I... I
packed a little bit.

43:01.846 --> 43:03.146
I was upset. You know that.

43:03.248 --> 43:04.480
Of course.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.182
And then you woke up
the next morning,

43:06.284 --> 43:08.484
and you went downstairs and
found your mom, right?

43:08.587 --> 43:10.053
Mm-hmm.

43:10.155 --> 43:13.590
Do you recognize this room?

43:14.759 --> 43:16.359
Yeah. That's my bedroom.

43:16.461 --> 43:20.363
And do you see what's
here on the nightstand?

43:20.465 --> 43:21.931
The glass of water.

43:22.033 --> 43:24.167
You see, what's weird
about this glass of water

43:24.269 --> 43:25.635
is that it's fresh.

43:25.737 --> 43:27.437
There's still
condensation on it.

43:27.539 --> 43:29.339
I don't understand.

43:30.875 --> 43:33.543
If you went straight to bed,

43:33.645 --> 43:35.945
how do you explain
this glass of water?

43:36.047 --> 43:37.547
I don't know.

43:37.649 --> 43:40.483
I was really drunk.

43:40.585 --> 43:42.251
- Maybe I went down to...
- The kitchen?

43:45.757 --> 43:47.523
I was really drunk.
I don't really...

43:47.626 --> 43:49.492
You don't remember?

43:49.594 --> 43:51.794
Right.

43:51.896 --> 43:54.163
Look, I'm just trying to
get your story straight.

43:54.265 --> 43:57.500
If you don't remember going
downstairs for a glass of water,

43:57.602 --> 44:01.204
I'm just curious what else you
might not remember seeing

44:01.306 --> 44:02.772
or doing.

44:19.224 --> 44:21.724
Sir, you can step over here.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.652
Remind me again why
you're not on this case.

44:49.754 --> 44:51.587
Everybody makes mistakes, Chief.

45:03.768 --> 45:04.934
Chief.

45:11.242 --> 45:12.542
Detective.

45:12.644 --> 45:14.944
I just had Natalie
Romero in here.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.212
Thought I told you not to...

45:16.314 --> 45:17.647
She came in on her own.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.817
She wanted to accuse her
ex-boyfriend again.

45:21.986 --> 45:23.319
Still stuck on that?

45:23.421 --> 45:24.987
She's trying to throw us.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.289
Now hear me out.

45:26.391 --> 45:28.057
I asked her about
the glass of water,

45:28.159 --> 45:30.126
and just like the suitcase,
she had nothing.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.127
Neither do we.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.662
That is not true.

45:32.764 --> 45:35.064
Anyone can tell that
that scene was staged,

45:35.166 --> 45:37.667
and nothing that this
girl has said adds up.

45:37.769 --> 45:39.769
We need to start
seriously investigating

45:39.871 --> 45:43.172
the possibility that Natalie
Romero is her mother's murderer.

45:46.010 --> 45:47.243
Yeah, I know.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.832
Hi. Natalie.

46:44.035 --> 46:46.469
Uh, I was gonna leave...

46:46.571 --> 46:47.670
Uh-huh.

46:47.772 --> 46:50.006
I have something
you need to see.

46:54.813 --> 46:56.412
What are these?

46:56.514 --> 46:59.282
You're not the only one
with investigative skills.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.387
Wait. Detective Monroe

47:04.489 --> 47:07.123
was the officer on scene the
night your father died?

47:07.225 --> 47:08.591
That's a hell of a coincidence.

47:08.693 --> 47:11.627
Or is it? Go to the
last page, toxicology.

47:16.511 --> 47:17.511
Redacted?

47:17.535 --> 47:19.001
Yeah, entirely.

47:20.705 --> 47:23.139
What are the legal
ramifications?

47:25.610 --> 47:27.577
I thought you were
in law school.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.919
Your dad mentioned that you
were prepping for your LSATs.

47:29.981 --> 47:31.024
You passed, I assume.

47:31.048 --> 47:33.015
It was over a year ago.

47:33.117 --> 47:35.277
Look, you're right. I can't
just sit with my hands tied

47:35.353 --> 47:37.987
while the police are just
connecting all the wrong dots.

47:39.224 --> 47:41.858
What do I do?

47:41.960 --> 47:43.593
You connect the right ones.

47:43.695 --> 47:44.727
Let's go.

47:51.636 --> 47:53.436
When you're writing,

47:53.538 --> 47:56.639
you gotta try and get in the
heads of all your characters.

47:56.741 --> 48:00.376
The same way police want to get
in the heads of criminals,

48:00.478 --> 48:02.511
we want to get in the
heads of police.

48:02.614 --> 48:04.014
We wanna know what
they're thinking,

48:04.115 --> 48:06.449
and we want to know why.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.551
The police think the
crime scene was staged.

48:08.653 --> 48:09.785
Very good.

48:09.888 --> 48:11.187
How can you tell?

48:11.289 --> 48:13.689
Because I heard them
say it at the station.

48:13.791 --> 48:15.024
Huh.

48:15.126 --> 48:16.726
And because the drawers
were all open,

48:16.828 --> 48:18.988
and there was nothing taken
other than what was on her.

48:19.012 --> 48:21.332
This table was flipped. I mean,
how would that even happen?

48:21.399 --> 48:22.598
Exactly. See?

48:27.138 --> 48:28.437
I, um...

48:29.574 --> 48:30.574
What about the window?

48:31.609 --> 48:33.276
What about it?

48:44.255 --> 48:45.888
The Smiths a few houses down

48:45.990 --> 48:47.256
had a robbery a few months ago,

48:47.358 --> 48:48.658
and they did the same thing,

48:48.760 --> 48:50.471
broke a piece of glass
on their door, too.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.094
We call this the point of entry,

48:52.196 --> 48:54.597
except in this case, it wasn't.

48:54.699 --> 48:56.432
So you think that robbery
was staged, too?

48:56.534 --> 48:58.701
No. I think this
murder was staged

48:58.803 --> 49:00.236
to look like that robbery.

49:00.338 --> 49:02.271
Here. Look at this.

49:04.309 --> 49:05.408
Glass.

49:05.510 --> 49:06.609
Clearly.

49:06.711 --> 49:09.078
Take a closer look.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.646
It's on the blanket...

49:12.116 --> 49:14.684
which could only be true
if it was broken in

49:14.786 --> 49:16.585
after the place was
being ransacked.

49:16.688 --> 49:19.121
You think the
police caught that?

49:19.223 --> 49:22.258
I don't know, but it means
that whoever did this

49:22.360 --> 49:24.860
had to come in from one
of the other doors.

49:24.963 --> 49:26.829
Or they were already
in the house.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.373
This is a lot.

49:37.475 --> 49:38.908
Maybe we should take a break.

49:39.010 --> 49:40.576
You want to get
something to eat?

49:40.678 --> 49:42.578
I mean, I never did get
to try those fries.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.247
Um, I think I want to spend
a little more time here...

49:45.350 --> 49:47.616
- Okay.
- Alone.

49:48.886 --> 49:50.319
Are you sure that's a good idea?

49:50.421 --> 49:51.865
Yeah, Shelby's about
to get off work.

49:51.889 --> 49:53.489
She can come by and pick me up.

49:53.591 --> 49:57.727
I just kinda want to spend
some time here by myself.

49:57.829 --> 50:00.429
Well, I get it. I don't
like it, but I get it.

50:00.531 --> 50:01.797
Actually, I don't get it.

50:01.899 --> 50:03.499
I'll text you the
second I leave.

50:03.601 --> 50:04.500
I promise.

50:04.602 --> 50:06.635
You better.

50:06.738 --> 50:09.071
Oh, and, hey,

50:09.173 --> 50:10.072
just so you know,

50:10.174 --> 50:13.676
you make a great heroine.

50:13.778 --> 50:14.944
Thanks.

50:15.046 --> 50:18.647
And thank you for trusting me.

50:18.750 --> 50:20.049
Hmm.

50:37.902 --> 50:39.101
But how could...

50:44.375 --> 50:45.775
Brody?

50:48.279 --> 50:49.745
Shelby?

50:52.617 --> 50:53.916
Ethan?

51:55.947 --> 51:58.187
Can you tell me anything
else about your assailant?

51:58.211 --> 52:00.382
Identifying marks?

52:00.485 --> 52:03.085
No. His face was covered.

52:03.187 --> 52:04.887
- With this, right?
- Yeah.

52:04.989 --> 52:07.656
I cut his arm, though,
and it was pretty deep.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.494
No blood. Seems clean.

52:14.999 --> 52:17.299
Natalie, have you
been drinking today?

52:19.003 --> 52:20.136
Excuse me?

52:20.238 --> 52:21.448
I'm sorry, but I have to ask.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.239
Well, I have to ask, too.

52:23.341 --> 52:24.874
Why don't you start treating her

52:24.976 --> 52:27.610
like the victim that she
is instead of a suspect?

52:27.712 --> 52:29.578
She was almost just killed,

52:29.680 --> 52:31.280
no thanks to your
handy police work.

52:31.382 --> 52:32.781
Shelby.

52:32.884 --> 52:37.286
Natalie, what were you
doing in there all alone?

52:37.388 --> 52:39.088
What does it matter?

52:39.190 --> 52:41.123
- I am on your side here.
- Are you?

52:41.225 --> 52:43.592
'Cause kinda starting to
feel like maybe you're not.

52:43.654 --> 52:46.134
Natalie, I got you a room so that
you wouldn't have to be here.

52:46.158 --> 52:47.663
Yeah. Thank you.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.865
I think I'm gonna head
there right now, actually.

52:51.102 --> 52:52.735
- Shelby.
- Gladly.

52:55.806 --> 52:57.873
I think you need to
take a look inside.

53:10.288 --> 53:12.821
That's from the shirt you were
wearing the night of the murder.

53:12.924 --> 53:14.523
How'd you know that?

53:14.625 --> 53:16.759
I-I watched the, uh,
surveillance footage at the bar.

53:16.861 --> 53:19.094
God, there's cameras
everywhere now, isn't there?

53:19.197 --> 53:20.329
Yeah.

53:20.431 --> 53:21.697
Yeah, there are.

53:23.367 --> 53:25.968
So this was stuck in
the window frame,

53:26.070 --> 53:29.038
which is the point of entry,
but we know it isn't.

53:29.140 --> 53:30.673
No. I would have seen it.

53:30.775 --> 53:32.116
So would the police.

53:32.140 --> 53:33.420
If someone's trying to frame me,

53:33.444 --> 53:35.044
they're not gonna
fall for it, right?

53:35.146 --> 53:37.780
I don't know. They seem to
be missing a lot lately.

53:37.882 --> 53:40.216
Oh, uh, I talked to Mrs.
Ledbetter, your neighbor.

53:40.318 --> 53:42.985
Every question they were
asking her was leading.

53:43.087 --> 53:45.221
They basically wanted her
to say that you were awful.

53:47.124 --> 53:49.225
But she... she didn't, though.

53:49.327 --> 53:50.993
She seems to really care,

53:51.095 --> 53:53.229
and, mm, because
you're not awful.

53:53.331 --> 53:54.331
No, I am.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.368
I was awful that night.

53:59.470 --> 54:02.671
I was just so frustrated
and confused and sad,

54:02.773 --> 54:04.640
and I feel guilty even
though I didn't...

54:04.742 --> 54:06.675
- I get it. I do.
- I know.

54:06.777 --> 54:09.017
Everyone says they get it.
Everyone says they understand,

54:09.041 --> 54:11.280
but you can't... You can't
understand unless...

54:11.382 --> 54:13.315
Unless you've been
through it yourself.

54:17.655 --> 54:20.189
I lost both my parents

54:20.291 --> 54:22.691
in a car accident when I was 19.

54:22.793 --> 54:24.660
I'm so sorry.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.262
The last thing I said to 'em

54:26.364 --> 54:28.897
was that I wouldn't pay
for the window I broke

54:29.000 --> 54:31.300
when I was mad about
a rejection letter.

54:32.603 --> 54:35.070
I came here looking for a story.

54:35.172 --> 54:37.172
That's true, but...

54:37.275 --> 54:39.541
I feel a real connection to you.

54:39.644 --> 54:42.278
And I know that sounds weird,
but, I mean, I just...

54:42.380 --> 54:45.681
I-I feel like I knew exactly
what you were feeling,

54:45.783 --> 54:51.120
th-the loneliness a-and
the confusion, the guilt.

54:56.661 --> 54:58.527
Everything I want to
say to you right now

54:58.629 --> 55:01.964
sounds kind of like the annoying
stuff everyone was saying to me.

55:02.066 --> 55:04.767
Well, maybe some
of them are right.

55:04.869 --> 55:08.704
Yeah. Doesn't make
it easier to hear.

55:08.806 --> 55:11.106
Ah, but sometimes
we have to hear it.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.711
Yeah.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.112
When I interviewed
your father...

55:22.086 --> 55:23.686
he talked about you.

55:25.022 --> 55:27.289
Uh, this may be hard to hear,

55:27.391 --> 55:30.059
but I think it might
make things easier, too.

55:40.037 --> 55:42.604
<i>Okay. Where'd we leave off?</i>

55:42.707 --> 55:45.174
<i>You were telling me about
the night of the 16th.</i>

55:45.276 --> 55:47.976
<i>Right. So I had just met with...</i>

55:49.513 --> 55:52.648
<i>Sorry. Thought I had
turned that off.</i>

55:54.585 --> 55:56.418
<i>It's my daughter.</i>

55:56.520 --> 55:58.020
<i>She's quite a character.</i>

56:00.224 --> 56:01.224
<i>Look.</i>

56:03.294 --> 56:05.427
This is your face.

56:05.529 --> 56:06.628
<i>Natalie, right?</i>

56:06.731 --> 56:08.130
<i>Oh, I mentioned her, huh?</i>

56:08.232 --> 56:10.265
<i>Mm. Once or twice or 20 times.</i>

56:10.368 --> 56:12.000
<i>She's pretty.</i>

56:12.103 --> 56:13.435
<i>She's remarkable.</i>

56:13.537 --> 56:15.437
<i>I'd tell you she was single,</i>

56:15.539 --> 56:18.674
<i>but she typically goes for
guys that are a little more...</i>

56:18.776 --> 56:20.943
<i>you know.</i>

56:21.045 --> 56:23.946
<i>Besides, next year, she'll
be away at law school,</i>

56:24.048 --> 56:25.714
<i>so even if...</i>

56:28.319 --> 56:31.186
<i>I'm really gonna miss her.</i>

56:31.288 --> 56:32.621
<i>To be honest,</i>

56:32.723 --> 56:34.656
<i>this case has kind
of gotten to me.</i>

56:34.759 --> 56:38.627
<i>You know, you... you think you
can trust someone, and then...</i>

56:41.232 --> 56:44.666
<i>I know I can always
count on her,</i>

56:44.769 --> 56:46.535
<i>no matter what,</i>

56:46.637 --> 56:49.705
<i>and I cannot wait to
see what she becomes.</i>

56:56.580 --> 56:58.046
I failed him.

56:59.950 --> 57:02.551
- N-No. No, that doesn't...
- He can't count on me.

57:02.653 --> 57:04.086
I'm not in law school.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.021
I'm literally not doing
anything with my life.

57:06.123 --> 57:07.556
Yet.

57:07.658 --> 57:09.591
Natalie, he had faith in you,

57:09.693 --> 57:10.993
a-and he wasn't wrong.

57:11.095 --> 57:13.962
You are remarkable,
no matter what.

57:15.466 --> 57:16.899
Is there more?

57:17.968 --> 57:19.568
Hours.

57:41.091 --> 57:42.191
Thank you.

57:45.863 --> 57:48.297
My dad was saying this case
made him distrust people.

57:48.399 --> 57:50.132
I wonder who he was
talking about.

57:50.234 --> 57:52.401
That's what I
intend to find out.

57:52.503 --> 57:54.736
Thank you for helping me.

57:54.839 --> 57:57.139
I feel like it's
been really hard,

57:57.241 --> 58:01.076
but having you here has kind of made
me feel like I can get through it.

58:01.178 --> 58:06.148
But I feel like my dad was
definitely wrong about one thing.

58:11.755 --> 58:13.789
What's going on?

58:15.693 --> 58:17.326
I don't know.

58:20.097 --> 58:21.230
That's my car.

58:21.332 --> 58:23.265
Detective, what are you doing?

58:23.367 --> 58:24.733
Natalie, I need
you to stay back.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.535
Do you have a search warrant?

58:29.273 --> 58:30.405
I don't understand.

58:30.508 --> 58:31.788
Detective, I have
something here.

58:37.214 --> 58:39.248
Recognize this?

58:39.350 --> 58:41.250
- It's the...
- Just a bookend.

58:42.620 --> 58:43.819
Log it.

58:45.089 --> 58:47.089
Natalie Romero, you
are under arrest

58:47.191 --> 58:49.458
for the murder of your
mother, Laura Romero.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.298
You have the right
to remain silent.

58:51.322 --> 58:52.602
Put your hands behind your back.

58:52.626 --> 58:54.162
- Please...
- Anything you say

58:54.265 --> 58:56.298
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.033
You have the right
to an attorney.

58:58.095 --> 59:00.295
If you cannot afford one, one
will be appointed for you.

59:00.319 --> 59:02.464
You understand the rights
as I have read them to you?

59:02.488 --> 59:03.488
Natalie...

59:04.375 --> 59:06.174
no matter what.

59:30.601 --> 59:33.235
Before you say anything,
Natalie, I need to remind you

59:33.337 --> 59:35.237
that we are not talking
friend to friend.

59:35.339 --> 59:37.940
Yeah, it's pretty obvious
you're not on my side,

59:38.042 --> 59:40.042
but, uh, question.
Are you on hers?

59:41.111 --> 59:42.311
The bookend matches

59:42.413 --> 59:43.912
the contusion on
your mother's head,

59:44.014 --> 59:45.147
and it's covered in prints,

59:45.249 --> 59:46.782
all of which, I
suspect, are yours.

59:46.884 --> 59:48.317
Because you wore gloves.

59:48.419 --> 59:50.752
That's not the bookend
that killed my mother.

59:50.854 --> 59:52.955
It just looks like it.
That's how bookends work.

59:53.057 --> 59:55.424
There's two of them. You
took that one after the fact

59:55.526 --> 59:57.286
and just got lucky that
I already touched it.

59:57.310 --> 59:58.660
What are you talking about?

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.495
You knew my father, didn't you?

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:04.099
You know we did.
We were friends.

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.779
Yeah, but something
happened, didn't it,

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:08.003
and you redacted his
toxicology report.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.438
This is ridiculous.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.706
Is it?

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:12.307
She handled my father's case,

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:14.209
just like she's handling
my mother's case.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:16.545
I heard about all the
questions you asked Betty,

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:18.513
how you found every
piece of evidence.

01:00:18.576 --> 01:00:21.136
And if I'd aimed my knife better
and it ended up in your stomach,

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.552
that bookend never even
would have been in my car.

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.190
Nick, you can't...

01:00:32.563 --> 01:00:35.230
- You can't seriously...
- Let me see your arm, Monroe.

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:52.547
The other arm. Take
off the jacket.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:00.722
Get out of my way.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:07.963
I'm sorry. I'm sor...

01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:21.843
Natalie.

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:24.179
Hey. You okay?

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:25.514
Th-They're not charging you?

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:28.650
Not yet, but they won't
let me leave town.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:38.727
Which is the exact opposite
of what I told you, I think.

01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:40.340
Well, she needs someone
she can trust.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:44.099
Obviously your department
isn't doing the trick.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:47.302
So I take it she got this
ridiculous conspiracy theory

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:50.105
in her head from you.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.440
Oh, kidding.

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:54.276
This is all a literary
exercise for you.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:57.379
The thing is, out here
in the real world,

01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:00.916
what you're doing is dangerous.

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:02.584
Right.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:05.620
You've got experience being
dangerous, don't you?

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:07.622
Did your friend tell you
that he'd been arrested

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:09.191
for breaking and entering...

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:12.294
and assault?

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.563
Is that true?

01:02:14.665 --> 01:02:16.965
Yeah, see, if you
had stolen his file

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.300
and not your father's,

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.936
you would have seen a lot more

01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:23.271
than a toxicology report
that had been redacted

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:25.741
to protect the reputation
of a good man.

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:34.182
Why don't I walk
you out, Natalie?

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.003
Excuse me!

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:57.105
Hi. Can I help you?

01:02:57.207 --> 01:02:59.608
I was just wondering if you'd
turned up anything new.

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:02.344
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.146
Oh, how rude. Greg.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.847
Greg Wilson.

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:08.550
Anyway, I know how
annoying it must be

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:10.152
when people play
amateur detective,

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:12.187
but my wife's been dying to know

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.889
if you turned up
anything on those tapes.

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:16.725
Uh, I'm sorry. Let's,
um, just pretend

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:18.293
that I'm new to this case.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:19.828
Which tapes are
we talking about?

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.898
Oh, I'm sorry. I live
just down the street.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.901
I told the other officer my camera
doesn't see the Romero house,

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:29.037
just the street, but he said
they might be valuable anyway

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.807
to paint a full and
vibrant picture.

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:34.543
Guy had a pretty good
vocabulary for a cop,

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.978
actually sounded
more like a writer.

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:42.517
Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:45.187
Uh, no. You've been
extremely helpful.

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:46.855
It's just that
that other officer

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.924
is going to be in
a lot of trouble.

01:03:51.762 --> 01:03:54.229
Okay, look, I'm the
first to admit it.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:55.764
I haven't always
been a nice guy.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.700
Except you didn't
admit it, so...

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:00.669
What do you want to show me?

01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:03.572
I-I used to have
some anger issues.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:06.208
I'm not gonna say
it's, you know,

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.676
from what happened
to my parents,

01:04:07.778 --> 01:04:09.418
but you know where I'm
coming from, right?

01:04:09.442 --> 01:04:11.446
Anger? Yeah, I'm familiar
with the emotion.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:13.215
What do you want to show me?

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:15.584
Yeah, of course. I just wanted
to make sure we're cool.

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.552
- We're not.
- Wait.

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:19.287
Okay, wait, wait.
All right, look.

01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:21.469
Remember how I said the cops
talked to your neighbors?

01:04:21.493 --> 01:04:22.924
- Yeah, Mrs. Ledbetter.
- Right.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:25.961
And I talked to the
neighbor next-door to her.

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:29.097
Guess what.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:32.767
What is this?

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:34.536
The night of the murder.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:35.904
Does it show anything?

01:04:36.006 --> 01:04:37.672
I don't know. Shall we?

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:38.974
Yeah.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:45.814
Hey, that's Ethan's car.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:47.415
He was there.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.817
Wait. Let it play.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.590
You're alive.

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:32.193
What are you still doing
talking to this creep?

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:34.763
"This creep" is the only
one making progress

01:05:34.865 --> 01:05:36.676
- towards figuring out...
- Natalie, I thought I told you

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.711
that if you wanted to move
on, you have to stop...

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.035
She doesn't have to do anything.

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.937
She can make her own decisions.

01:05:41.999 --> 01:05:44.439
Obviously, because right now she's
making a pretty crappy one.

01:05:44.463 --> 01:05:45.874
Trying to solve her
mother's murder?

01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:47.842
Spending time alone
with a convicted...

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:50.378
Whatever you call a person
who assaults people.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.120
- Well said.
- Come on, Natalie. Let's go.

01:05:52.144 --> 01:05:54.911
No, wait. No, Brody
has new evidence.

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:57.719
New evidence?

01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:01.323
How long have you been waiting
to show her that, Brody?

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:02.435
Little while.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:03.825
Hmm.

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:05.994
Well, I have old news
for you, too, Natalie.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.663
I was actually interested
in this clown,

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:12.200
so I e-mailed myself his
manuscript from his computer.

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:15.537
Look at the title.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.342
<i>"A Daughter's Betrayal."</i>

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:22.377
- You're his main suspect.
- You were.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.312
Obviously. How could you not be?

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:25.647
Oh, but you've cleared me now?

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:28.316
There's video of...

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.085
It's your boyfriend.

01:06:30.147 --> 01:06:31.867
I mean, what other motive
could he have had?

01:06:31.891 --> 01:06:33.188
What motive could I have had?!

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.824
Well, an inheritance.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.660
Look, Natalie, she's just trying

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.095
to play us against each other

01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:41.863
to keep you from getting
back on your feet

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:44.199
and leaving her to waste away
in some neighborhood bar.

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.600
Are you kidding me?

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:47.769
No, get this.

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:51.072
He was at the funeral.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:52.507
I told you what
that means, right?

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:54.187
- What does that mean?
- What that means

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.744
is I'm sick of your games.

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:58.213
- Finally. Let's just...
- No, both of you.

01:06:58.315 --> 01:06:59.748
I'm sick of being
steered around.

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.182
If this is gonna
go badly for me,

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:02.917
I want it to be because
I made a mistake,

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.797
- not because of someone else's.
- Natalie, trust me. I...

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:07.222
Trust, yeah. I'm having a
hard time with that lately.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:10.592
I need to take some time to
figure out how to trust myself.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.732
That's a bad choice of words.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:20.602
And so are these.

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:23.138
Maybe so.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:54.836
Natalie?

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:02.844
Nat?

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.815
Natalie?

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.691
Natalie?

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:23.865
This was the last place
I saw my mother alive.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.435
And I was really mean to her.

01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:32.674
And I blame myself,
but shouldn't...

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:36.678
because somebody took her.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:39.613
Natalie, you said that you
had new evidence to show me.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:02.337
You know, Ethan does a
lot of creepy things.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.906
Natalie, I think
that accusation's

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:06.674
pretty played out. Don't you?

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:08.843
I mean, I'm glad
you're not accusing

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.145
Monroe anymore, but...

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:11.712
He used to just sit in his car

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.548
<i>after he was dropping
me off and wait</i>

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.517
<i>for my bedroom
lights to turn off.</i>

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:18.685
<i>I kind of used to like looking
out and seeing his car.</i>

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:22.524
But I wasn't the only
one that could see him.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:24.058
There's a camera.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.495
<i>You have a security camera?</i>

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.430
<i>No, we don't.</i>

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:34.469
The Wilsons down the street do.

01:09:38.108 --> 01:09:40.308
And you're saying this
camera caught something.

01:09:46.983 --> 01:09:50.718
Ethan. He was here
a little earlier

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.252
than the coroner thought, but...

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.622
I would love to get a
look at that footage.

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:01.029
It's him.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:06.601
I want you to stay up here.

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.610
You know, I'm starting to
think it's a little funny

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:18.580
that everywhere she
is, there you are.

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:21.416
- I think it's funny...
- Just because you have a gun

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:22.917
doesn't mean you
can protect her.

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:24.579
- Ethan, calm down!
- I can protect her!

01:10:24.603 --> 01:10:26.054
- Calm down.
- That's my job!

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:28.357
Nick?

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:36.030
Nick?

01:10:38.969 --> 01:10:40.201
Ethan?

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.443
Oh, my God.

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:50.845
He hit me.

01:10:50.907 --> 01:10:52.427
He hit me. I was
holding my gun on him,

01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:53.348
and he hit me.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:56.150
He was probably drunk.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:59.988
Yeah. Well, he was probably
drunk that night, too.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:04.425
Yeah. At the bar, there's
surveillance footage of it.

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:06.928
- So...
- So I was wrong, Natalie.

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:09.030
Looks like you've
made your case.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:15.303
Let's go out to my car.
I can call this in,

01:11:15.365 --> 01:11:17.205
and then we can go get
the video of the street.

01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:19.830
Nick, you're bleeding.

01:11:25.181 --> 01:11:27.949
Must have hit me
harder than I thought.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:54.509
Natalie Romero, you
are under arrest

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:57.145
for the murder of your
mother, Laura Romero.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.448
You...

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:04.252
I advise you not to resist.

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:09.724
Brody Long?

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.225
Oh, thank heavens.

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:12.994
- You're under arrest.
- That's fine.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:15.063
Wait. What? For what?

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:17.165
Impersonating an officer and
obstruction of justice.

01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:19.356
Fine. I plead guilty.
You need to see this.

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:27.075
Help!

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:29.110
Mrs. Ledbetter!

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.179
Help! Mrs. Ledbetter!

01:12:31.281 --> 01:12:33.014
No. No.

01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:34.849
Mrs. Ledbetter!

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:35.783
Mrs. Ledbetter!

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:38.686
Help! Mrs. Ledbetter!

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:41.222
Nice dog.

01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:42.757
Thanks.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.926
Let's go, Lady. Good girl.

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:47.362
Betty! Mrs. Ledbetter!

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.764
Help! Mrs. Ledbetter!

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.632
No. No.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.973
She's not back at the
crime scene, is she?

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:03.244
Knowing her, probably. Why?

01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:06.080
Nick said he was going there
to follow up on a hunch.

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:08.049
Wait. I'm coming with you.

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:10.618
Obviously. You're
still under arrest.

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:27.201
Hey, hey, let me out.

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.905
Hey, I could be your backup.

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:33.040
I-I'll watch your
six or something.

01:13:47.701 --> 01:13:48.701
Natalie!

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:49.957
- Oh, God.
- Natalie!

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:52.260
He's dead. It's too bad.

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:54.673
We really could have used his
sixth sense for stalking Natalie.

01:13:54.697 --> 01:13:56.297
What are you doing? Stop.
You're gonna...

01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:58.499
He doesn't have a sixth sense.
He has a tracking app.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.867
A tracking app?

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:02.103
It's how insecure
people date these days.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:04.172
No pass code. Idiot.

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:05.440
Sorry.

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:10.778
There. South shore, Vernon Bay.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.346
What's there?

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:15.450
Just marsh. It's where
the Manzottis used to...

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:16.717
Oh, God.

01:14:25.728 --> 01:14:28.095
But I'm supposed to
be under arrest!

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:45.813
You're never gonna
get away with this.

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:47.515
Too many people saw you.

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:49.261
Yeah. Well, that's the
thing about trust.

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:51.586
People trust you, you can
get away with anything.

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.721
Is that what you told my father?

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.690
I didn't have to tell
your father anything,

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.325
because he trusted me.

01:14:57.427 --> 01:15:00.361
See, your dad, he
wasn't an idiot.

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:03.898
As a matter of fact, I think he
probably would have rolled over

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.667
if the Manzotti had asked him,

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:08.603
just like I did.

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:11.506
But they couldn't
risk asking him,

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:12.907
because they didn't trust him...

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:15.543
or you and your mom.

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:16.744
You're just not so stacked

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.646
in the brain
department, are you?

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:23.184
I give you this. You got bigger
balls than your dad did.

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:34.629
Come back here.

01:15:36.566 --> 01:15:37.865
Oh, you...

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:43.838
Natalie. Natalie!

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.407
Put the gun down, and
put your hands up!

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:53.614
Monroe...

01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:59.086
look, you... you were right all along.
Natalie did it.

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:00.888
Chief, do not make me
pull this trigger.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.523
Put the gun down.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:08.462
All right. Just, uh,
calm down, all right?

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:11.532
Put it down, Nick.

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:22.543
Put your hands behind your back.

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:28.883
Listen, I don't know what that
squirrely little writer said...

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:31.652
I saw the tape, Nick.

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:45.666
Who else saw the tape?

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:48.402
Everybody.

01:16:48.504 --> 01:16:49.971
Monroe, you're a
decent detective,

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:52.406
but you are one lousy liar.

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:55.576
Goodbye, Monroe.

01:16:58.281 --> 01:16:59.547
Natalie. Natalie.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.284
Thank you.

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:04.418
Oh, God.

01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:09.991
- Drop the gun, Natalie.
- Don't do it.

01:17:10.093 --> 01:17:13.194
Or what? You're gonna
kill me anyway.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:14.962
Drop the gun,

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:17.798
or I'm gonna kill Shelby, too.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.001
That the same deal
you offered my mom?

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:21.513
Would you just have
come upstairs...

01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:24.872
You really think I wanted
to do any of this?!

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.540
Your dad...

01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:31.879
Killing your dad hurt me,

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:34.315
but it solved too many problems.

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:36.517
And to have those
problems resurface again

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.819
just because Laura wanted
to play amateur detective,

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:40.454
I couldn't let it happen.
I couldn't...

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:44.959
Nick. Thank you for
coming over so late.

01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:46.460
Of course, Laura.

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:48.396
You got me thinking
of Andy, too.

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:49.997
Come in.

01:17:53.803 --> 01:17:56.637
I tried for months now not to
think about it, but the truth is,

01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:58.205
I just can't stop.

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:01.208
Yeah, I know the
feeling, trust me,

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.477
but I just think that
now you should...

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:05.680
Andy hadn't had a
drink in five years.

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:08.649
All right, so maybe
he slipped, huh?

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.685
I mean, I know it's
hard to believe...

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:12.053
I requested his case file.

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:17.425
Yeah, I heard.

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:22.897
Oh, but my request was denied.

01:18:22.999 --> 01:18:24.665
Laura...

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:27.201
it is not healthy to keep
digging up the past.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.836
What?

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:31.072
It's just funny you
used that phrase.

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:33.674
I filed a request with
the Coroner, too.

01:18:36.512 --> 01:18:37.912
You did what?

01:18:39.649 --> 01:18:43.784
When he died, I didn't want
to look at the reports,

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.754
the autopsy and everything.

01:18:46.856 --> 01:18:48.989
Everyone said I shouldn't.
Even you said it.

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:52.993
But now I need to, Nick.

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:57.631
And Natalie?

01:18:57.734 --> 01:19:01.302
What does she say about
what you're doing?

01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:03.771
I haven't told her
any of the details,

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:07.108
but she disapproves, thinks
it's a waste of time.

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:12.513
The truth is Natalie and I have been
going through a bit of a rough patch.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:19.887
<i>And now you.</i>

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:22.556
Why couldn't you
just let this be?

01:19:22.658 --> 01:19:24.625
Because it's in my blood.

01:19:26.829 --> 01:19:27.829
That's too bad.

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:31.398
I'm sorry, Andy.

01:19:38.674 --> 01:19:40.074
Game over!

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:49.885
Nat?

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:00.194
Natalie, are you hurt?

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:02.441
That's okay. You're okay.

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:06.267
You're... You're okay.

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:07.902
I'm here.

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:10.571
We're here.

01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:16.610
It's over, Nick.

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:34.261
Finished.

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:36.831
And?

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:38.532
I have questions.

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:40.634
Okay. That's good.

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:42.670
Did you only yell, "Game over,"

01:20:42.772 --> 01:20:44.532
so it could be the title
of the last chapter?

01:20:44.556 --> 01:20:45.739
Totally.

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:48.042
And why didn't I get
to be in it anywhere?

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:49.476
I drove you to the finale.

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:52.046
Yeah, how did you get
there in the book?

01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:54.148
He drives Ethan's Camaro.

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.383
Hey, why didn't you
drive his Camaro there?

01:20:56.485 --> 01:21:00.387
I, um, maybe sort of don't
know how to drive a stick.

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:04.425
Mm, mm, mm.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:07.161
Somebody ordered Rudy's?

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:09.797
I'll get that for you.
Thank you.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.571
You're really gonna
miss this stuff

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:18.906
while you're away at school.

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:20.586
Yeah, you were right
about these fries.

01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:22.243
Better get some before
I take 'em all.

01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:24.378
And this is for you.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.679
Mm. Thanks, Mrs. Ledbetter.

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:26.914
You're quite welcome.

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:30.851
More like Ledbest. Here you go.

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:33.988
Oh, thank you.

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:45.299
I'm not that drunk.

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:47.568
I know,

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:49.203
but it's good for you.

01:21:51.173 --> 01:21:53.274
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:55.876
I know,

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:59.046
and I love you no matter what.

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:02.850
I love you, too,

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.718
no matter what.

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:14.795
<i>Natalie.</i>

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:24.371
You okay?

01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:30.077
I am.
