00:09.050 --> 00:10.649
Step up, step
up, Whack-a-Mole.

00:10.651 --> 00:13.285
Two tickets gets you three hits.

00:13.287 --> 00:14.787
Here's your prize. Congratulations.

00:14.789 --> 00:18.390
Okay, Kirby, the key is to
aim slightly above the target

00:18.392 --> 00:19.892
so that the water arcs down.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.594
How do you know that?

00:21.596 --> 00:23.028
I love carnivals.

00:23.030 --> 00:25.564
They're just, uh, magic.

00:25.566 --> 00:27.967
I never want tonight to end.

00:27.969 --> 00:29.869
Yeah, me neither.

00:29.871 --> 00:33.139
I mean, think about it.
No one's unhappy here.

00:33.141 --> 00:35.541
We wouldn't have to worry
about that math midterm.

00:35.543 --> 00:37.109
No one sitting with me on the bus.

00:37.111 --> 00:39.378
And here we go!

00:39.380 --> 00:40.713
Eye on the game, eye on the game.

00:42.315 --> 00:43.983
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:43.985 --> 00:46.819
Yes!

00:46.821 --> 00:48.621
I won!

00:49.723 --> 00:51.724
- All right, thank you.
- Congrats, kid.

00:51.726 --> 00:54.193
Charlotte, I wanted ask you...

00:54.195 --> 00:56.228
Charlotte?

00:56.230 --> 00:58.497
Ha ha.

00:58.499 --> 01:00.399
- Charlotte!
- Thank you.

01:02.469 --> 01:04.569
Behind your ear. Is that your ticket?

01:04.572 --> 01:07.072
- Oh, my goodness.
- You found it.

01:07.074 --> 01:10.543
Can I get two of these?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074

01:20.787 --> 01:24.657
- All right.
- Got it on your end?

01:24.659 --> 01:25.758
Good.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.660
What are you people still doing here?

01:27.662 --> 01:30.196
Didn't the feds already
tell you to hightail it?

01:30.198 --> 01:34.400
You can't set up a carnival on my land.

01:34.402 --> 01:36.302
You're not being very friendly.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.937
Well, I ain't your friend.

01:37.939 --> 01:41.307
Oh, you will be.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.108
We're all friends here.

01:43.110 --> 01:44.910
Welcome...

01:44.912 --> 01:48.681
to the greatest carnival on Earth.

01:50.852 --> 01:52.852
The greatest carnival on Earth.

01:52.854 --> 01:54.687
Faster.

01:54.689 --> 01:56.088
Faster.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.756
Oh, you can do better than that. Faster.

01:57.758 --> 01:59.124
Faster still.

01:59.126 --> 02:02.461
Faster! Do it faster!

02:25.151 --> 02:27.786
My apologies.

02:32.894 --> 02:36.161
Oh, Miss Cillian, I...

02:36.163 --> 02:38.764
Beg your pardon. I thought
you were someone else.

02:38.766 --> 02:40.833
- Forgive me.
- Sure. That's okay.

02:59.753 --> 03:02.955
Jenkins, stay away. Stay
away from the carnival.

03:02.957 --> 03:04.757
Whatever you do, don't
come after us, Jenkins.

03:19.941 --> 03:21.573
Hi, one please.

03:21.575 --> 03:24.276
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

03:24.278 --> 03:26.211
Do you have a senior discount?

03:26.213 --> 03:29.848
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

03:31.551 --> 03:33.452
Hey, you know what? I'm cool.

03:41.328 --> 03:45.230
Ah, thank you for the
Christmas present, Mr. Jones.

03:45.232 --> 03:46.832
Oh, hi. Oh!

03:46.834 --> 03:49.201
Hello, hi. I'm sorry,
I was just looking for...

03:49.203 --> 03:51.036
you guys work here?

03:51.038 --> 03:53.672
'Cause I got turned around
at the Ferris wheel and I...

03:53.674 --> 03:58.677
oh, there he is, you see? Come
here, you precocious little scamp.

03:58.679 --> 04:01.480
Looking all over for you.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.315
You have scared your uncle, silly.

04:03.317 --> 04:07.753
Uncle Silly. That's his
nickname. My cousin... nephew.

04:07.755 --> 04:10.055
Bye.

04:10.057 --> 04:12.391
Thanks, those clowns are freaky.

04:12.393 --> 04:14.126
You know what? You shouldn't be here.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.363
Nah, it's fine. If I'm back by
7:00, my folks won't even notice.

04:17.365 --> 04:19.204
What? No, no, no. I mean,
it's not a good place.

04:19.228 --> 04:20.228
I know, tell me about it.

04:20.231 --> 04:22.096
They don't even have a
Double Shock Drop Tower.

04:22.099 --> 04:25.371
Oh... no. It is dangerous.

04:25.373 --> 04:27.013
Hold on a second.
You've been here before.

04:27.037 --> 04:28.741
Every night since it showed up.

04:28.743 --> 04:32.511
My dad thinks it's creepy because it
just, like, appeared out of nowhere.

04:32.513 --> 04:34.353
You know, no trucks or
anything, but I like it.

04:34.377 --> 04:35.614
Have you seen this person?

04:35.616 --> 04:38.650
Uh, no. But I have seen him.

04:38.652 --> 04:39.785
Where?

04:39.787 --> 04:42.054
Uh, right there.

04:42.056 --> 04:43.722
Oh.

04:43.724 --> 04:45.791
Thank you. There you go.

04:45.793 --> 04:48.293
So, what are you gonna do?

04:48.295 --> 04:51.663
What? Um, thank you for
your help, young man.

04:51.665 --> 04:53.832
You really have to leave now.

04:56.836 --> 04:58.470
And yet, still, here you are.

04:59.839 --> 05:04.376
The lady on your phone,
is she your daughter?

05:04.378 --> 05:06.311
No, my friend.

05:06.313 --> 05:08.914
Ah, yeah, my grandpa has
a younger friend, too.

05:08.916 --> 05:10.716
My mom doesn't like her, though.

05:12.953 --> 05:15.954
Okay, you really have to
leave. Or, you know what?

05:15.956 --> 05:18.390
I'm gonna tell the carnies
you snuck in without paying.

05:18.392 --> 05:20.292
They won't care.

05:20.294 --> 05:21.170
Look.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.796
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

05:23.798 --> 05:25.631
Hello? Hi.

05:25.633 --> 05:27.566
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

05:27.568 --> 05:29.768
Everyone here is like that.

05:29.770 --> 05:34.039
You can do anything. The only ones
who will come after you are the clowns.

05:34.041 --> 05:36.408
Well, then, why sneak in?

05:36.410 --> 05:38.577
I'm a precocious scamp.

05:55.095 --> 05:57.196
He dropped one.

06:02.502 --> 06:04.069
Is it your friend?

06:05.539 --> 06:07.339
Do you know where these were taken?

06:07.341 --> 06:08.807
Yeah, right there. Come on.

06:08.809 --> 06:10.542
- What...?
- Let's go.

06:11.978 --> 06:14.947
Hi... aw. Get a room.

06:14.949 --> 06:17.616
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

06:23.456 --> 06:25.891
I presume you were
raised on electronics.

06:25.893 --> 06:27.493
Uh, yes, I was.

06:27.495 --> 06:28.735
There's a memory card in there.

06:28.759 --> 06:30.762
How do I get the pictures off of it?

06:30.764 --> 06:32.598
Um...

06:34.334 --> 06:36.969
Should be done.

06:36.971 --> 06:38.971
Yes.

06:41.941 --> 06:43.142
Uh...

06:44.177 --> 06:47.279
Those people look weird.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.281
Yes, they do. I...

06:55.723 --> 06:59.458
Something very bad happened here.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.431
What's in that tent?

07:06.433 --> 07:09.701
- Let's find out!
- Hey! No.

07:09.703 --> 07:13.772
It is time you actually
heed my warning and go home.

07:13.774 --> 07:15.741
But it's the carnival's last day.

07:15.743 --> 07:18.944
There is nothing about this
carnival that you can trust.

07:18.946 --> 07:21.413
You see? What happened to
the people in these pictures,

07:21.415 --> 07:23.882
that's what happened to my friends,

07:23.884 --> 07:26.451
and they are a lot
better at sneaking around

07:26.453 --> 07:28.120
than either you or I.

07:28.122 --> 07:31.023
Listen, I can take care of myself, okay?

07:31.025 --> 07:32.324
I see.

07:32.326 --> 07:35.227
You know... you know
those dreams you have,

07:35.229 --> 07:37.696
somebody's chasing you

07:37.698 --> 07:40.165
and you try to scream for help...

07:40.167 --> 07:45.037
...but nothing comes out of your mouth?

07:45.039 --> 07:47.272
This place...

07:47.274 --> 07:49.007
those dreams are real.

07:49.009 --> 07:52.344
And here, when the clowns catch you,

07:52.346 --> 07:54.413
you never wake up.

07:54.415 --> 07:58.483
So I implore you. Go.

08:36.155 --> 08:37.322
Colonel Baird.

08:37.323 --> 08:40.892
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

08:42.395 --> 08:46.098
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

08:46.590 --> 08:50.493
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

08:50.495 --> 08:54.630
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

08:54.632 --> 08:58.901
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

08:58.903 --> 09:03.072
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

09:03.074 --> 09:06.442
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

09:07.332 --> 09:10.078
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

09:10.367 --> 09:11.767
Oh, eenie, meanie, miney... oh.

09:11.769 --> 09:13.969
Welcome to the greatest car...

09:16.440 --> 09:18.440
- Jenkins!
- Oh, Colonel,

09:18.442 --> 09:20.082
I can't tell you how
glad I am to see you.

09:20.107 --> 09:22.111
What is that disgusting smell?

09:22.113 --> 09:24.914
Oh, this? Discarded
condiments, a little cow manure.

09:24.916 --> 09:26.516
Sort of a poor man's smelling salts.

09:26.518 --> 09:28.751
You had to ask.

09:30.387 --> 09:31.788
What you lookin' at?

09:33.032 --> 09:35.532
Jenkins, please tell me I'm dreaming

09:35.534 --> 09:37.668
and haven't really grown a second head.

09:37.670 --> 09:39.169
Sorry, Colonel, you have.

09:39.171 --> 09:40.537
You've been transmogrified.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.841
Well, you all have.

09:43.843 --> 09:46.210
Hello, Ezekiel.

09:46.212 --> 09:49.847
Okay. I see you, Jacob
Stone. I see your muscles,

09:49.849 --> 09:52.649
- your abdominals and your biceps...
- ...greatest carnival on Earth.

09:52.673 --> 09:54.852
...and your gluteus Maximus.

09:54.854 --> 09:57.421
Jenkins, get this second
head off my shoulders.

09:57.423 --> 09:59.356
Oh, like you weren't looking.

09:59.358 --> 10:00.691
They're my colleagues!

10:00.693 --> 10:02.192
Well, luckily, I'm not you.

10:02.194 --> 10:04.695
Or am I? Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:04.697 --> 10:06.417
- Oh, much better.
- This sucks.

10:06.441 --> 10:09.400
All right, here. I'll retrieve
Miss Cillian. You awake the others.

10:09.402 --> 10:11.282
What should I do?

10:11.306 --> 10:13.103
And speed would be of the essence.

10:13.105 --> 10:15.039
Excuse us. Pardon us. Coming through.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.207
- Coming through.
- Are you okay, Cassandra?

10:17.209 --> 10:21.211
Squeak once for yes, twice for no.

10:21.213 --> 10:23.047
I'm never eatin' sushi again.

10:23.049 --> 10:25.549
- Would you stop playing that thing?
- He can't stop.

10:25.551 --> 10:28.018
No more than you can
stop looking like Popeye.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.987
But you can change us back, right?

10:29.989 --> 10:32.069
One would hope, otherwise
we're going to have to move

10:32.093 --> 10:34.391
Miss Cillian's experiment
to the indoor pool.

10:34.393 --> 10:35.859
- Great.
- Pool party.

10:35.861 --> 10:37.541
I don't understand how
this happened to us.

10:37.565 --> 10:38.662
I don't remember anything.

10:38.664 --> 10:41.932
Not surprising. This entire
carnival is a perverted manipulation.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.400
Real, not real, whoever did this

10:43.402 --> 10:44.501
is either very powerful

10:44.503 --> 10:47.171
or very new at magic, or worse, both.

10:47.173 --> 10:49.139
You let them escape?

10:49.141 --> 10:51.575
They were gonna be the
highlight of my show tonight.

10:51.577 --> 10:53.310
Come on, guys. I depend on you.

10:53.312 --> 10:55.579
You should be sad.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.147
You know how long we've worked on this?

10:57.149 --> 10:58.582
Now, they can't be far.

10:58.584 --> 11:00.865
You go out there and you find
them and you bring them back

11:00.889 --> 11:04.254
or I will melt that smile off your face!

11:04.256 --> 11:06.690
Go!

11:06.692 --> 11:08.158
Go!

11:08.160 --> 11:11.261
God, you're a bunch of clowns.

11:11.263 --> 11:13.130
- Jenkins, where's that door?
- Right here,

11:13.132 --> 11:15.132
and then left at the Twinkie stand.

11:16.335 --> 11:18.769
What is it, Cassandra?

11:18.771 --> 11:22.039
What?

11:24.075 --> 11:25.209
I know those clowns.

11:25.211 --> 11:27.111
- Those clowns know us.
- Who is it?

11:33.485 --> 11:36.754
Mr. Stone, how much do
you think you can lift?

11:54.573 --> 11:56.493
Could you have put the
door any further, Jenkins?

11:56.495 --> 11:58.935
The colonel told me not to come
at all. Be glad I ignored her.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.006
In here, in here.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.096
Oh, thank God.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.864
That must be a weight
off your shoulders.

12:20.866 --> 12:24.368
Well, good. Away from the influence

12:24.370 --> 12:25.930
of the pervasive magic of the carnival,

12:25.954 --> 12:28.439
you're transmutations have reversed.

12:28.441 --> 12:31.175
My feet are back! And my voice!

12:31.177 --> 12:33.377
And I'm talking really loud!

12:38.983 --> 12:41.718
No! No! No! No, no, no, no!

12:41.720 --> 12:43.520
You let them go? Gah!

12:43.522 --> 12:44.755
This is not good.

12:44.757 --> 12:45.789
I'm gonna punish you.

12:45.791 --> 12:47.991
I'm gonna make you
part of the wax museum.

12:50.729 --> 12:55.332
Charlotte's here now? How
do I look? How's my tie?

12:55.334 --> 12:56.767
Don't touch me.

12:56.769 --> 12:58.302
Oh, okay.

12:58.304 --> 12:59.803
Go and make everything perfect.

12:59.805 --> 13:01.872
Perfect!

13:01.874 --> 13:03.907
Go!

13:07.112 --> 13:10.013
You're amazing and mysterious.

13:10.015 --> 13:12.616
You're amazing and mysterious.

13:12.618 --> 13:16.153
You're amazing and mysterious.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.424
It's you.

13:20.426 --> 13:23.127
It's the real you?

13:23.129 --> 13:25.796
I don't believe it.

13:25.798 --> 13:27.764
Excuse me?

13:27.766 --> 13:29.600
Well...

13:29.602 --> 13:32.736
your golden ticket. You're the winner.

13:32.738 --> 13:34.271
That's wonderful.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.906
Yeah, I got this in the mail.

13:35.908 --> 13:39.510
It said to come here to
pick up my cash prize?

13:39.512 --> 13:41.845
Yes, yes. And you have free admission

13:41.847 --> 13:44.181
to everything at the carnival.

13:44.183 --> 13:47.684
That... that sounds like fun,
but I have to get to work.

13:47.686 --> 13:50.420
No. No, no, no, no.

13:50.422 --> 13:53.390
We have many attractions,
and a magic show.

13:53.392 --> 13:56.560
The best you've ever
seen, with yours truly.

13:56.562 --> 14:01.031
I'm sure it is, but my boss
will be unhappy if I'm late.

14:01.033 --> 14:03.000
Again.

14:03.002 --> 14:07.337
Well, that's really the thing about
carnivals, isn't it, Charlotte?

14:07.339 --> 14:09.540
No one's unhappy here.

14:09.542 --> 14:11.308
How do you know my name?

14:11.310 --> 14:15.012
A magician never reveals his secrets.

14:15.014 --> 14:17.047
But it's on your tag.

14:19.517 --> 14:20.651
I'm sorry.

14:20.653 --> 14:25.522
Um, maybe I could
stay for a few minutes.

14:25.524 --> 14:29.426
Yes, wonderful! You're gonna
love it. You're gonna love it.

14:29.428 --> 14:31.361
I'm gonna... rather...

14:31.363 --> 14:34.364
allow me to show you around.

14:34.366 --> 14:38.035
Thank you, Mister...

14:38.037 --> 14:42.439
You may call me the Amazing Mysterium.

14:44.442 --> 14:45.876
Whoa.

14:45.878 --> 14:47.811
Whoa.

14:47.813 --> 14:50.480
- That is amazing.
- Yes.

14:50.482 --> 14:52.216
And that's only the beginning.

14:52.218 --> 14:54.151
Please.

15:05.324 --> 15:07.625
Who knew being a fish
was so dehydrating?

15:07.627 --> 15:11.028
Or that snake charmers
had such amazing abs.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.930
Seriously, did you see my abs?

15:12.932 --> 15:14.365
We have to go back.

15:14.367 --> 15:15.666
Uh, you sure you kept the right head?

15:15.668 --> 15:17.788
We have to find out what's
happening at that carnival.

15:17.812 --> 15:19.804
We don't even know what
happened the first time.

15:19.806 --> 15:22.046
How are we supposed to stop
it from happening the second?

15:22.070 --> 15:23.651
With a little help.

15:24.244 --> 15:26.477
This is a mixture of sodium pentothal,

15:26.479 --> 15:28.512
fennel for sight, thyme for memory,

15:28.514 --> 15:33.517
and, well, some special
ingredients of my own invention.

15:33.519 --> 15:37.188
It will restore your memory.
Also good for clogged drains.

15:37.190 --> 15:38.522
Sounds dangerous.

15:38.524 --> 15:41.759
You have magically-induced
lacunar amnesia.

15:41.761 --> 15:44.662
Memory loss affecting a specific event.

15:44.664 --> 15:47.031
Now, whatever you saw at that
carnival scared you enough

15:47.033 --> 15:49.500
that you tried to warn
me not to come after you.

15:49.502 --> 15:52.570
We need to know what that was.

15:52.572 --> 15:55.106
Bottoms up.

15:55.108 --> 15:57.375
Cheers.

15:58.410 --> 16:00.711
Oh! Oh!

16:02.815 --> 16:04.782
Oh, it's like a hangover in reverse.

16:04.784 --> 16:07.485
Is anyone else seeing colors
that don't exist in real life?

16:07.487 --> 16:09.647
All right, all right, we
need to go from the beginning.

16:09.671 --> 16:10.675
How did the case start?

16:10.677 --> 16:14.025
Uh, I was laying digital breadcrumbs

16:14.027 --> 16:15.526
to keep DOSA off our tail.

16:15.528 --> 16:17.895
And then the Clipping Book flipped open.

16:17.897 --> 16:22.533
It sent us to a hospital room in Iowa

16:22.535 --> 16:24.568
to talk to a Jane Doe.

16:24.570 --> 16:26.570
But she wasn't talking.

16:26.572 --> 16:29.674
Says here she was
admitted for exhaustion.

16:29.676 --> 16:31.609
The nurse said they picked
her up at a carnival.

16:31.611 --> 16:32.610
She was their juggler.

16:32.612 --> 16:35.346
She came in with open
sores on her hands.

16:35.348 --> 16:38.516
Busted hands, perfect manicure.

16:38.518 --> 16:42.486
Definitely not the nails of
someone who juggles for a living.

16:42.488 --> 16:44.155
Oh, but she was wearing a ring.

16:44.157 --> 16:45.656
With a unique seal.

16:45.658 --> 16:50.528
Sign of the Twelve Tables,
the heart of Roman law.

16:50.530 --> 16:55.266
The ring is a "coveted award given
by the California Bar Association."

16:55.268 --> 16:57.468
Last year's winner,
Charlotte Holloway, Esquire.

16:57.470 --> 17:01.038
Yep, she's a bigwig partner
for a law firm in San Francisco.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.240
So this woman left a high-paying job

17:03.242 --> 17:05.309
in a law firm to join a carnival?

17:05.310 --> 17:06.277
It happens.

17:06.279 --> 17:08.279
I mean, Baird left her super cool job

17:08.281 --> 17:10.114
with the NATO Antiterrorism Task Force

17:10.116 --> 17:12.450
to become a Guardian for the Library.

17:12.452 --> 17:14.885
Way better dental plan.

17:14.887 --> 17:17.821
Nothing about this woman, Charlotte
Holloway, seemed to add up.

17:17.824 --> 17:21.726
So we went to check out the carnival

17:21.728 --> 17:23.048
and talk to the carnival's owner.

17:23.071 --> 17:24.627
The Amazing Mysterium.

17:24.630 --> 17:27.298
Ah, the juggler. She
collapsed this morning.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.933
Couldn't keep up with the stress

17:28.935 --> 17:30.801
of carnival life, I suppose.

17:30.803 --> 17:32.636
She used to be a high-powered attorney.

17:32.638 --> 17:33.804
Really? I didn't know that.

17:33.806 --> 17:36.440
Come to think of it,
how did you know that?

17:36.442 --> 17:40.444
- We're Librarians.
- Ah.

17:40.446 --> 17:43.848
Well, she was one of the
greatest jugglers I've ever seen.

17:43.850 --> 17:46.751
Hard to replace her on
short notice, but we make do.

17:46.753 --> 17:49.587
Well, we'd like to take a
look around, if you don't mind.

17:50.756 --> 17:51.756
Mind?

17:51.758 --> 17:54.291
Enjoy the carnival, my friends.

17:58.630 --> 18:01.265
Two heads are better than one.

18:05.904 --> 18:09.473
And while you guys
were talking to Houdini,

18:09.475 --> 18:12.009
me and Jones found out
where the clowns came from.

18:12.011 --> 18:16.380
Seems we weren't the only
ones asking questions.

18:16.382 --> 18:18.616
There was a police officer.

18:18.618 --> 18:21.652
The clowns grabbed him, took
him into the House of Horrors.

18:39.038 --> 18:40.938
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.

18:40.940 --> 18:42.640
Come on, let's go now!

18:44.276 --> 18:46.610
Hey!

18:46.612 --> 18:48.245
That's the last thing I remember.

18:48.247 --> 18:50.614
I remember running like crazy

18:50.616 --> 18:52.783
and then the Insane Clown
Posse was on my tail,

18:52.785 --> 18:55.486
so I went and I hid inside a...

18:55.488 --> 18:57.455
A photo booth?

19:02.360 --> 19:05.463
Ah!

19:06.498 --> 19:09.200
Worst souvenir ever.

19:10.235 --> 19:11.902
We were on the midway.

19:11.904 --> 19:15.139
Jenkins, I was trying to call
you to give you an update.

19:15.141 --> 19:17.808
This is so cool.

19:17.810 --> 19:20.411
See, a normal plain mirror
reflects a perfect image,

19:20.413 --> 19:22.480
but this one has convex
and concave sections

19:22.482 --> 19:26.350
that make me look like the
inhabitant of a lower gravity planet.

19:27.553 --> 19:30.054
Huh, you've really
never been to a carnival.

19:30.056 --> 19:31.455
Nope.

19:31.457 --> 19:34.391
But I love clowns.

19:34.393 --> 19:36.961
I hate clowns.

19:36.963 --> 19:38.395
I couldn't fight back.

19:38.397 --> 19:42.099
It felt like someone was inside my body

19:42.101 --> 19:44.201
and I was trying to resist it

19:44.203 --> 19:45.436
so I could warn you.

19:54.247 --> 19:57.448
Jenkins, whatever you do,
stay away from the carnival.

19:57.450 --> 19:58.883
Do not come after us.

20:00.620 --> 20:04.588
Next thing I remember is you finding me.

20:04.590 --> 20:08.158
And... other me.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.694
He can make people do whatever he wants.

20:10.696 --> 20:12.596
He can turn 'em into whatever he wants.

20:12.598 --> 20:15.299
And conjure a carnival out of thin air.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.235
This is more power than
I've seen in one person

20:18.237 --> 20:20.504
in a very long time.

20:20.506 --> 20:25.576
We need to find out who
this Amazing Mysterium is.

20:29.414 --> 20:31.849
Colonel?

20:31.851 --> 20:35.586
While I admit that my field
experience is limited, rest assured...

20:35.588 --> 20:38.756
That is not why I warned you
to stay away from the carnival.

20:38.758 --> 20:42.293
Jenkins, you told me there is a
battle coming, the ultimate battle.

20:42.295 --> 20:44.828
Judson is gone, Charlene is missing,

20:44.830 --> 20:47.698
Flynn is in and out, and
DOSA is after the Library.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.600
He managed to get all four of us.

20:49.602 --> 20:52.236
What if he got you, too?

20:52.238 --> 20:53.998
Yes, fine, I understand.
Your logic is sound,

20:54.022 --> 20:57.408
but there's nothing that would stop me

20:57.410 --> 20:59.343
from coming after you.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.979
Oh.

21:01.981 --> 21:04.915
Remind me to never doubt you again.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.517
I don't get it.

21:08.219 --> 21:12.723
There's nothing on the Internet
about an Amazing Mysterium.

21:12.725 --> 21:14.091
Well, that's magic in itself.

21:14.093 --> 21:16.193
Come on, guys. In the
military, when we run out

21:16.195 --> 21:18.062
of a digital trail, we
look for a physical one.

21:18.064 --> 21:19.697
Shoeprints, types of clothing...

21:19.699 --> 21:21.899
- Ooh, like his cape.
- What about it?

21:21.901 --> 21:24.101
Well, you know how I see
patterns in everything?

21:24.103 --> 21:25.636
Brush strokes or cloth.

21:25.638 --> 21:28.238
This was the finest
fiber I have ever seen.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.407
It was 12.5 microns.

21:30.409 --> 21:33.611
Even the best cashmere is
13.5 microns, so it's...

21:33.613 --> 21:34.578
Vicuña.

21:34.580 --> 21:36.313
Matata.

21:36.315 --> 21:38.682
It means "fabric of the gods."

21:38.684 --> 21:41.385
Yeah, I once "borrowed"

21:41.387 --> 21:43.107
a European prince's
sports coat made out it.

21:43.131 --> 21:47.758
Okay, so how many companies have
made a magician's cape out of it?

21:47.760 --> 21:48.826
Only one.

21:48.828 --> 21:50.427
Yamena Tailors in Peru.

21:50.429 --> 21:53.430
They made one for a "Kirby Goulding."

21:53.432 --> 21:56.000
Ah, here we go.
Low-rent kid's magician.

21:56.002 --> 21:59.470
Hang on. He must've turned
into a great magician overnight.

21:59.472 --> 22:02.373
I mean, up until six months
ago, his reviews are terrible,

22:02.375 --> 22:04.135
and then all of a sudden,
they rave about him

22:04.159 --> 22:06.110
like he's the second
coming of Siegfried and Roy.

22:06.112 --> 22:08.112
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Six months ago.

22:08.136 --> 22:10.047
That's when the traveling
carnival started.

22:10.049 --> 22:14.251
And Kirby went from zero to
hero. I smell an artifact.

22:14.253 --> 22:16.253
The question is, Jenkins, which one?

22:16.255 --> 22:17.888
An artifact that can turn

22:17.890 --> 22:20.024
a run-of-the-mill children's magician

22:20.026 --> 22:23.060
into someone who can transform
matter, control minds?

22:23.062 --> 22:24.962
They're here.

22:24.964 --> 22:28.298
The Scepter of Korob,
the Fontainebleau Diadem.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.034
They're here, stored in the Library.

22:30.036 --> 22:32.503
Wait, so we're looking
for an ancient artifact

22:32.505 --> 22:34.638
that even Mr. Jenkins hasn't heard of?

22:34.640 --> 22:36.473
Why does it have to be ancient?

22:36.475 --> 22:39.176
Because it was made when
magic was in the world.

22:39.178 --> 22:42.546
Yeah, but magic is back, big time.

22:42.548 --> 22:45.616
Brand-new artifacts are
being created every day?

22:45.618 --> 22:48.619
If it's a new artifact
Kirby's been using

22:48.621 --> 22:51.822
to create a carnival and
control everyone around him...

22:51.824 --> 22:54.458
It could literally be anything.

22:56.922 --> 22:57.599
All right.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.777
This are the most potent
smelling salts that I can make.

23:00.778 --> 23:03.444
Use them to wake up all
those under Kirby's spell.

23:03.446 --> 23:05.246
Get them far away from the carnival.

23:05.248 --> 23:08.249
Hopefully they haven't been
under his influence for too long.

23:08.251 --> 23:10.852
I've got the magic
spectrometer up and running.

23:10.854 --> 23:13.164
But I would still have
to have some kind of clue

23:13.165 --> 23:14.606
about the objects we're looking for.

23:14.630 --> 23:16.298
There's nothing in these books.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.466
Tells you everything
you want to know about

23:17.468 --> 23:19.568
a magical artifact
except how it was made.

23:19.570 --> 23:21.603
No, no, no, no. The how, that's easy.

23:21.605 --> 23:24.740
At some point, an object with
some emotional significance

23:24.742 --> 23:26.575
came into contact with a ley line.

23:26.577 --> 23:30.079
The what, we have to find
something that's important to him.

23:30.081 --> 23:33.849
Mm, something the Amazing
Mysterium holds dear.

23:33.851 --> 23:35.317
That narrows it down.

23:37.288 --> 23:40.389
His wand, huh? Magician's best friend.

23:40.391 --> 23:42.658
Way too obvious, mate.

23:42.660 --> 23:47.262
Okay, the Amazing Mysterium will have
his gang of clowns on the lookout for us.

23:47.264 --> 23:50.833
But I figured out a way
for us to go undetected.

23:50.835 --> 23:52.968
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:52.970 --> 23:54.636
- Yep.
- No, no, no.

23:54.638 --> 23:56.839
I'm not... I don't use magic.

23:56.841 --> 23:58.474
It's not magic.

23:58.476 --> 24:00.342
It's whimsy.

24:21.397 --> 24:23.732
Every thief knows, if
it's something valuable,

24:23.734 --> 24:25.701
it's either kept close or kept safe.

24:25.703 --> 24:28.170
Kirby's trailer. It's
patrolled by security clowns,

24:28.172 --> 24:30.572
but I bet you anything there's
something in there to protect.

24:30.574 --> 24:32.641
Take Ezekiel. Cassandra
and I will get eyes

24:32.643 --> 24:34.810
on the Amazing Mysterium.

24:55.098 --> 24:56.965
I'm telling you, it's the wand.

24:56.967 --> 24:59.301
All right, cool your jets, Harry Potter.

24:59.303 --> 25:01.336
What's with all the retro...

25:01.338 --> 25:04.807
why would you keep your
old school supplies?

25:04.809 --> 25:06.975
High school yearbook?

25:06.977 --> 25:09.178
Yeah, don't most people
want to forget high school?

25:09.180 --> 25:11.547
"Have a good summer,"
"have a good summer."

25:11.549 --> 25:14.683
That's usually what you write
when you forget someone's name.

25:26.162 --> 25:28.063
He took pictures of us.

25:28.065 --> 25:30.065
It's like a sick serial killer

25:30.067 --> 25:31.600
keeping mementos of his victims.

25:31.602 --> 25:34.837
Not victims, friends.

25:34.839 --> 25:36.505
And he's looking for one in particular.

25:42.745 --> 25:46.882
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

25:46.884 --> 25:50.586
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

25:50.588 --> 25:52.988
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

25:52.990 --> 25:55.457
Everyone who works here
is under the same spell.

25:55.459 --> 25:57.659
Well, not for long.

25:57.661 --> 26:00.128
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

26:00.130 --> 26:00.929
It isn't working.

26:00.931 --> 26:02.531
They've been under too long.

26:02.533 --> 26:03.853
The only way we can save them now

26:03.877 --> 26:05.934
is to find that artifact.

26:05.936 --> 26:08.403
Welcome to the greatest
carnival on Earth.

26:22.485 --> 26:26.188
You loved carnivals as a kid.

26:26.190 --> 26:28.824
I'm guessing, because you have a face

26:28.826 --> 26:31.226
that says that you would dream

26:31.228 --> 26:33.228
about being someone else.

26:33.230 --> 26:35.530
Who did you want to be?

26:35.532 --> 26:37.766
Not the awkward kid I was.

26:37.768 --> 26:40.269
What about you?

26:40.271 --> 26:41.703
I don't know.

26:41.705 --> 26:44.373
Not a waitress who can't
pay her electric bill.

26:44.375 --> 26:46.909
You are much more than
a waitress, Charlotte.

26:46.911 --> 26:49.611
Come on, line up. Water races.

26:49.613 --> 26:51.113
This feels so familiar.

26:51.115 --> 26:52.614
Squirt in the clown's mouth.

26:52.616 --> 26:54.082
Try your luck?

26:54.084 --> 26:55.517
Sure.

26:55.519 --> 27:00.622
Now, the key is to aim slightly above...

27:00.624 --> 27:02.724
So the water arcs down.

27:06.930 --> 27:08.597
Why hasn't he put the spell on her yet?

27:08.599 --> 27:11.300
Because he has feelings for
her. Look, you can see it.

27:11.302 --> 27:12.634
Oh, yeah. Totally.

27:12.636 --> 27:15.671
He's displaying every
microexpression tell in the book.

27:15.673 --> 27:18.707
80% of how we communicate
with one another is nonverbal.

27:18.709 --> 27:22.411
When people are nervous, they run
their hands through their hair.

27:22.413 --> 27:25.714
They adjust their clothes.

27:25.716 --> 27:29.117
When people are intrigued,
they raise their eyebrows.

27:29.119 --> 27:31.653
And cue the smile.

27:31.655 --> 27:34.089
Oh! That is impressive.

27:34.091 --> 27:35.531
Is that how you knew Flynn liked you

27:35.555 --> 27:37.159
- when you first met him?
- Nope.

27:37.161 --> 27:39.995
He sent me a note that said, "Do
you like me? Check yes or no."

27:39.997 --> 27:42.931
- That's classic.
- We have to know who that woman is.

27:42.933 --> 27:44.299
She's Charlotte Holloway.

27:45.768 --> 27:47.469
Another Charlotte Holloway?

27:47.471 --> 27:48.791
Like the juggler in the hospital?

27:48.815 --> 27:50.272
Yes, and yes.

27:50.274 --> 27:53.508
In fact, we found these
in Kirby's trailer.

27:53.510 --> 27:56.144
Five special invitations to
Kirby's carnival in five cities?

27:56.146 --> 27:59.181
Yeah, all addressed to five
different Charlotte Holloways.

27:59.183 --> 28:00.515
Well, that's not a coincidence.

28:00.517 --> 28:02.484
No, lawyer/juggler Charlotte

28:02.486 --> 28:03.785
was invite number five.

28:03.787 --> 28:06.088
Seems ever since Kirby
found his real magic power,

28:06.090 --> 28:07.330
he's been looking for this gal.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.391
And when they turn out
to be the wrong one,

28:09.393 --> 28:12.227
he punishes them by
turning them into carnies.

28:12.229 --> 28:15.397
How do we know that this is the
Charlotte that he's looking for?

28:15.399 --> 28:19.034
Because this is the
Charlotte he's in love with.

28:19.036 --> 28:20.869
And, go!

28:23.006 --> 28:25.807
- Oh, got it, got it.
- We have a winner.

28:25.809 --> 28:28.810
No, no. No, no, no, no. He's not
supposed to win. She's supposed to win.

28:28.812 --> 28:30.712
No, it's fine. All just in good fun.

28:30.714 --> 28:33.281
You're the special guest, Charlotte.
Give... give her the prize.

28:33.283 --> 28:35.017
- Hey! Give her the prize.
- Hey, what...?

28:36.420 --> 28:37.853
Excuse me for a minute.

28:37.855 --> 28:40.055
I told you never to interrupt
me when I'm with her.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.993
What the heck is this?

28:44.995 --> 28:47.629
You found this in my trailer?

28:47.631 --> 28:49.164
No.

28:51.134 --> 28:52.934
I'm sorry. Where were we?

28:52.936 --> 28:56.505
This has been great, but I
really need to get to work.

28:56.507 --> 28:58.407
No, you can't go. You just got here.

28:58.409 --> 29:00.709
And you have to see my show.

29:00.711 --> 29:01.777
Maybe some other time.

29:01.779 --> 29:04.546
No, there is no other
time. You're here now.

29:04.548 --> 29:06.815
Now I can finally give you
what you've always wanted,

29:06.817 --> 29:08.617
an escape from the real world,

29:08.619 --> 29:13.321
a place where no one
will ever bother us again.

29:13.323 --> 29:15.791
Hey.

29:15.793 --> 29:18.727
I have been looking for you
for a very long time, Charlotte.

29:18.729 --> 29:21.129
Now, you once said that you
never wanted the carnival to end.

29:21.153 --> 29:23.398
Well, tonight, after the Ascension,

29:23.400 --> 29:26.902
this carnival will live forever.

29:26.904 --> 29:30.372
Ascension? Doesn't sound
like a fun new ride.

29:30.374 --> 29:32.574
Wait, wait. When Houdini's mother died,

29:32.576 --> 29:34.409
he became obsessed with the occult,

29:34.411 --> 29:35.610
mostly debunking it,

29:35.612 --> 29:37.312
but he wrote a letter
to Arthur Conan Doyle

29:37.314 --> 29:40.048
speculating other dimensions,

29:40.050 --> 29:43.018
referring to travel
there as the Ascension.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.620
Like when the Library
untethered from our reality.

29:45.622 --> 29:49.458
So, if Kirby could send the entire
carnival off to another dimension...

29:49.460 --> 29:51.293
And anyone else that's trapped here...

29:51.295 --> 29:53.528
Then we gotta find that
new artifact tonight.

29:53.530 --> 29:56.031
Before everything and
everyone in this carnival

29:56.033 --> 29:57.466
disappears forever.

30:01.604 --> 30:05.139
Please, I just want to go home.

30:05.141 --> 30:08.676
This is your home now. I want
to make sure you're having fun.

30:08.678 --> 30:11.612
- Are you having fun?
- No.

30:11.614 --> 30:14.382
No, no. Cards aren't fun.

30:16.985 --> 30:18.719
I know what's fun.

30:18.721 --> 30:20.921
Friends, join us!

30:22.424 --> 30:25.659
Let's get silly!

30:33.969 --> 30:38.773
Charlotte Holloway, welcome to
the greatest carnival on Earth.

30:44.479 --> 30:46.747
If he's going to Ascension
this entire carnival,

30:46.749 --> 30:48.749
why's he wasting time doing a magic act?

30:48.751 --> 30:50.317
He wants to impress her.

30:50.319 --> 30:51.786
He keeps waving that wand around

30:51.788 --> 30:53.068
but he's not using magic on her.

30:53.092 --> 30:54.522
He needs her affection to be real.

30:54.524 --> 30:56.123
No, I bet it's the wand.

30:56.125 --> 30:57.525
What?

30:57.527 --> 30:59.487
I mean, what else would
a magician be attached to?

30:59.511 --> 31:00.828
Plus, he uses it all the time.

31:00.830 --> 31:02.270
- Unbelievable.
- He's so delusional,

31:02.294 --> 31:04.231
he doesn't even realize
his power is in the wand.

31:04.233 --> 31:06.600
Wow, I wish I would've thought of that.

31:06.602 --> 31:08.536
Oh! Oh, wait a minute! I did!

31:08.538 --> 31:09.570
All right, guys, we need to get a read

31:09.572 --> 31:11.372
on the wand using the
magic spectrometer.

31:11.374 --> 31:13.454
- Well that might be a problem.
- We kind of lost it.

31:13.478 --> 31:16.343
- You lost it.
- You lost the magic spectrometer?

31:16.345 --> 31:18.612
Do you know how much those things cost?

31:18.614 --> 31:20.614
All right, guys. I've got a plan.

31:25.954 --> 31:28.756
Ooh!

31:36.298 --> 31:39.033
Grab their masks and
take their place onstage.

31:41.002 --> 31:44.572
Yes!

31:44.574 --> 31:46.907
Oh, come on. This is all for you.

31:46.909 --> 31:48.976
I know what'll cheer you up.

31:53.949 --> 31:55.282
Pies!

31:55.284 --> 31:59.019
Everybody loves pies! Pies, pies, pies!

31:59.021 --> 32:01.689
Everybody gets pies. Here.

32:01.691 --> 32:04.225
Oh, direct hit!

32:04.227 --> 32:07.695
Give 'em pies. Pies, more pies.

32:10.999 --> 32:13.467
You're still not laughing.

32:13.469 --> 32:17.271
All right, you want to
see something really funny?

32:17.273 --> 32:18.706
Punch him.

32:20.709 --> 32:23.911
Oh!

32:23.913 --> 32:25.679
Come on, you hit like a girl.

32:25.681 --> 32:28.048
Punch him!

32:29.317 --> 32:30.918
Oh, you're not gonna take that.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.419
Go on, hit him back.

32:32.421 --> 32:34.221
Now your turn.

32:35.490 --> 32:38.759
Wow, that looked like it really hurt.

32:38.761 --> 32:42.563
You must be angry. I mean,
angry enough to want to kill him.

32:46.334 --> 32:49.870
Don't worry, my friends. I
know exactly how that feels.

32:49.872 --> 32:54.208
You see, Charlotte. My friends
are dying to entertain you.

32:56.712 --> 32:59.013
Give him the baseball bats.

32:59.015 --> 33:01.315
- What now?
- No, Jones.

33:01.317 --> 33:04.084
We're not giving him the
bats. They'll kill each other.

33:04.086 --> 33:06.720
Please stop this!

33:11.126 --> 33:12.526
Give 'em the baseball bats.

33:14.430 --> 33:16.163
Please, please, you can't do this!

33:26.141 --> 33:27.373
Why are you doing this?

33:27.398 --> 33:30.211
I don't know, maybe
because you're a kidnapper.

33:30.213 --> 33:33.480
Or just a sadist who doesn't
understand the power of true magic.

33:33.482 --> 33:35.382
I don't understand magic?

33:35.384 --> 33:37.251
Magic flows through me.

33:37.253 --> 33:39.220
I'm the greatest magician in the world.

33:39.222 --> 33:40.788
No, you're not.

33:40.790 --> 33:44.325
A real magician would use
technique and skill and finesse.

33:44.327 --> 33:46.727
Flair and showmanship,
of which you have none.

33:46.729 --> 33:50.197
Yeah, Houdini, Dante, Blackstone,
they were the real deal, not you.

33:50.199 --> 33:51.298
You're a fraud.

33:51.300 --> 33:54.568
True magicians are masters of illusion.

33:54.570 --> 33:56.637
- Disguise...
- Escape artistry...

33:56.639 --> 33:58.172
And sleight of hand!

33:58.174 --> 34:01.875
Let's leave magic to
the professionals, mate.

34:01.877 --> 34:03.911
I don't need a magic wand

34:03.913 --> 34:06.814
in order to be the greatest
magician in the world.

34:09.016 --> 34:12.085
Um... guys, I can't move.

34:12.088 --> 34:14.088
I guess that's not the artifact?

34:14.090 --> 34:17.424
See, Stone, I told
you it wasn't the wand!

34:17.426 --> 34:18.726
Take 'em away.

34:18.728 --> 34:21.527
Let 'em find out what it
means to not be my friend.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.474
You all ruined my show,

34:33.476 --> 34:35.074
and right during the grand finale!

34:35.077 --> 34:38.779
Since I can't have you causing
any more problems, congratulations.

34:38.781 --> 34:42.850
You're all about to become a
permanent part of my House of Horrors.

34:52.159 --> 34:55.195
Wax friends don't cause trouble.

34:56.489 --> 34:57.811
I really thought it was the wand.

34:57.835 --> 35:00.801
If it's not the wand, what could it be?

35:00.803 --> 35:03.904
I don't want you to be afraid
of these people anymore.

35:03.906 --> 35:05.906
All right? I'll make it so that

35:05.908 --> 35:08.976
none of them bother us ever again.

35:08.978 --> 35:10.544
"Doubt truth be a lie,

35:10.546 --> 35:13.814
but always know, I love you."

35:13.816 --> 35:17.217
Actually, it's "doubt
truth to be a liar,

35:17.219 --> 35:19.053
but never doubt I love."

35:19.055 --> 35:21.588
"Hamlet," Act 2, Scene 2.

35:21.590 --> 35:23.957
Don't correct me.

35:23.959 --> 35:27.127
Don't be wrong.

35:27.129 --> 35:28.495
Once they're taken care of,

35:28.497 --> 35:30.397
I will perform my final trick,

35:30.399 --> 35:34.601
and then you and I and this
entire carnival will live on.

35:34.603 --> 35:37.905
Please, Mysterium,

35:37.907 --> 35:39.773
I don't know what I did to you,

35:39.775 --> 35:44.378
but I'm so sorry. I
just want to go home.

35:46.681 --> 35:50.617
The greatest gift a man
ever bestowed upon a woman,

35:50.619 --> 35:53.087
and you still don't even know who I am.

35:56.224 --> 35:58.325
I was invisible to you,

35:58.327 --> 36:01.762
and once you said,
"I love the carnival."

36:01.764 --> 36:05.999
And so I recreated it for
you, exactly as it was before!

36:06.001 --> 36:09.203
Before? There was another carnival?

36:09.205 --> 36:11.939
In Kirby's trailer, there was a poster,

36:11.941 --> 36:14.141
a carnival in Green Town, Kansas.

36:14.143 --> 36:18.212
So everything here is a recreation
of a carnival from his childhood?

36:18.214 --> 36:22.983
I did this all for you, just for you.

36:22.985 --> 36:24.918
- You don't care.
- No...

36:24.920 --> 36:28.122
I won a prize for you, and
you walked away from me.

36:28.124 --> 36:29.757
Well, you can't walk away this time.

36:29.759 --> 36:33.127
You will understand.
You will all understand

36:33.129 --> 36:37.331
when you are frozen in wax forever!

36:43.633 --> 36:45.601
Come on, Charlotte, think.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.836
I don't know what he's talking about.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.338
Winning me a prize?

36:49.340 --> 36:51.640
That prize could be what's
powering his magical mojo.

36:51.642 --> 36:53.342
Whatever it is, it obviously has

36:53.344 --> 36:55.377
incredible emotional
significance for him.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.079
Try and remember.

36:57.081 --> 36:58.847
I went to the carnival every summer.

36:58.849 --> 37:00.329
I don't know when I could've met him.

37:00.353 --> 37:01.950
1996, to be exact,

37:01.952 --> 37:04.820
at a carnival just like this one.

37:04.822 --> 37:07.823
Everything about
Kirby's exactly the same

37:07.825 --> 37:10.926
as the magician on the
poster that he wants to be.

37:12.862 --> 37:17.232
Everything but the flower on the lapel.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.568
The flower?

37:19.570 --> 37:22.671
Wait, did you say "Kirby"?

37:22.673 --> 37:23.672
Kirby.

37:25.542 --> 37:27.276
Kirby Goulding?

37:31.014 --> 37:32.080
You know who I am?

37:32.082 --> 37:34.650
Of course I know who you are, Kirby.

37:34.652 --> 37:36.818
You were my friend.

37:36.820 --> 37:38.453
You're lying.

37:38.455 --> 37:40.389
You're just saying
that to save yourself.

37:40.391 --> 37:41.924
No, no, it's true.

37:41.926 --> 37:45.127
We had math together, Mr. Crane's class.

37:45.129 --> 37:47.129
And I remember

37:47.131 --> 37:50.299
we went to the carnival together.

37:50.301 --> 37:53.969
We played the water pistol game.

37:53.971 --> 37:55.370
Yes, we did.

37:56.573 --> 38:01.109
And you won. A flower.

38:01.111 --> 38:03.445
I remember everything about that night.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.781
Do you remember walking away
to go off with that magician

38:05.783 --> 38:07.215
and just leaving me?

38:07.217 --> 38:09.484
I went to get us tickets
for the magic show,

38:09.486 --> 38:11.887
but when I got back, you were gone.

38:13.423 --> 38:16.325
I would never leave you.

38:16.327 --> 38:18.560
You wouldn't?

38:20.263 --> 38:22.497
You were such a sweet kid.

38:24.667 --> 38:27.736
I thought you were cute.

38:27.738 --> 38:31.340
And that amazing and beautiful flower,

38:33.142 --> 38:36.478
you won it for me.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.580
I did.

38:44.587 --> 38:48.256
I've wanted to give
you this for 20 years.

38:51.060 --> 38:55.230
We can be friends again.

38:55.232 --> 38:57.766
Oh, Kirby.

38:57.768 --> 39:00.369
We could never be friends again.

39:00.371 --> 39:01.703
Why not?

39:01.705 --> 39:04.906
'Cause you're a total psycho now!

39:04.908 --> 39:07.843
How dare you. Do you know who I am?

39:07.845 --> 39:12.514
A pathetic loser who's just lost
his super-charged flower power?

39:12.516 --> 39:14.783
Go get them. Get them!

39:14.785 --> 39:17.119
They're not under your spell anymore.

39:18.354 --> 39:19.921
Give me the flower.

39:20.990 --> 39:22.591
Give me the flower!

39:23.660 --> 39:25.093
Give it to me now!

39:26.429 --> 39:28.397
- Yoo hoo!
- Give it to me.

39:28.399 --> 39:29.631
Give it to me right now!

39:29.633 --> 39:32.334
Don't you dare! No, no, no!

39:50.053 --> 39:53.255
Excuse me. Sir?

39:54.524 --> 39:57.693
Might be... might be my sister.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.661
It just appeared, all right?

39:59.663 --> 40:02.597
I'm telling you. A whole
carnival right here on my land.

40:02.599 --> 40:05.534
That's why I called you
FBI guys in the first place.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.602
We're not with the FBI, sir.

40:07.604 --> 40:09.237
We're with DOSA,

40:09.239 --> 40:10.872
the Department of Statistical Anomalies.

40:10.874 --> 40:12.194
All right, well, whoever you are,

40:12.218 --> 40:13.588
I'm just glad I got my land back.

40:13.590 --> 40:16.978
And you have no memory of
who was behind all this?

40:19.982 --> 40:21.516
Thank you.

40:42.438 --> 40:44.406
He was a sweet kid.

40:44.408 --> 40:47.743
Nerdy, but not sick.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.344
What happened?

40:49.346 --> 40:52.380
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

40:52.382 --> 40:54.449
Nothing more powerful than magic.

40:54.451 --> 40:55.784
Except knowledge.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.019
I can't believe you
thought it was the wand.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.420
This new artifact proved
to be very dangerous.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.285
Something like this could happen again.

41:09.286 --> 41:12.316
Yes, if we do not get the
ley lines under control

41:12.317 --> 41:14.000
this new wing for modern artifacts

41:14.001 --> 41:15.969
will fill up rather quickly.

41:16.795 --> 41:20.249
And next time, we may not be so lucky.
