00:01.001 --> 00:02.602
Several
states are rolling the dice

00:02.602 --> 00:04.838
in a move to jumpstart their economies.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.873
It's a gamble that could pay off,

00:06.873 --> 00:09.275
or one we may all regret.

00:09.275 --> 00:11.678
It's a critical moment
for states like Georgia,

00:11.678 --> 00:13.646
home of the world's busiest airport,

00:13.646 --> 00:16.549
where the governor has
issued guidelines to open up.

00:16.549 --> 00:18.752
Our Steve Osunsami leads
us off from Atlanta

00:18.752 --> 00:19.753
with what's happening there

00:19.753 --> 00:21.187
and what it could mean

00:21.187 --> 00:22.589
for the rest of us.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.457
Let's get this started, right?

00:25.392 --> 00:27.427
This is
reopening day in Atlanta.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.497
After weeks of trying to pay
her bills with empty pockets

00:30.497 --> 00:32.632
and closed doors at her hair salon,

00:32.632 --> 00:34.434
small business owner, Regina Herschel,

00:34.434 --> 00:36.302
was excited and nervous today.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.137
When the governor announced it,

00:37.137 --> 00:38.838
what was your feeling when you heard that?

00:38.838 --> 00:39.773
Oh my goodness,

00:39.773 --> 00:42.108
I was excited because I felt like,

00:42.108 --> 00:45.745
oh my God, now I have a chance
to at least try to work,

00:45.745 --> 00:47.814
so that way I can provide for my family,

00:47.814 --> 00:52.452
so I was excited about it,
even though I am still nervous.

00:52.452 --> 00:53.920
That's a natural feeling.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.590
Turn left.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.592
Turn left on Led borough Lane.

00:59.592 --> 01:04.330
In 800 feet, turn right on
Wolfe Road, then turn right.

01:07.333 --> 01:11.071
Turn right, then turn
right on Wilton Road.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.916
- Where the hell this bitch got me going?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.684
This nasty ass trash.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.756
- 'Cause I motherfucking said
that we was gonna pull up.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.591
Friend, pull up.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.692
'Cause I said we gonna pull up

01:32.692 --> 01:34.360
and beat his motherfucking ass.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.261
Stop.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.330
You have reached your destination.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.705
- You ready to do this, bitch?

01:45.705 --> 01:47.207

02:57.377 --> 02:59.445

You've got me in the hood,

35:59.857 --> 36:02.493

36:02.493 --> 36:03.694

36:22.446 --> 36:24.782

36:24.782 --> 36:26.784
It is the melanated side of my hand,

36:26.784 --> 36:28.553

36:28.553 --> 36:30.688

You ain't gonna do that.
- I don't know him Frederick.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.035
It doesn't matter.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.138
- Uh uh, hush your lips, hush
your lips, hush your lips.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.339
The city should've stayed closed.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.309

- All right, come on now, don't
wanna be stuck in the house.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.587
- Frederick, run along
to the concessionary

37:02.587 --> 37:04.855
and see if you can find me any wine.

37:04.855 --> 37:06.324
None of that cheap shit.

37:06.324 --> 37:07.158

businesses are already back open

37:26.110 --> 37:28.379

37:28.379 --> 37:30.448
Despite criticism from President Trump,

37:30.448 --> 37:32.350
Governor Kemp felt it was safe enough

37:32.350 --> 37:35.486
to have the partial reopening

37:35.486 --> 37:38.222
that included hair salons,
gyms, and nail salons,

37:38.222 --> 37:40.424

52:33.550 --> 52:34.518

52:49.032 --> 52:49.966

52:49.966 --> 52:50.867

52:50.867 --> 52:51.701

53:00.544 --> 53:01.611
- You're gonna let us in.

53:01.611 --> 53:04.414
- You can go to the wing
spot around the corner.

53:04.414 --> 53:06.316
Wing Spot around the corner?.

53:06.316 --> 53:07.150
he's so damn unbelievable.

53:07.150 --> 53:08.218
- Once again, where's the manager?

53:08.218 --> 53:10.086
- You real tall, lower your tone.

53:10.086 --> 53:10.921
- And you real short.

53:10.921 --> 53:14.157
So I understand everything might seem loud

53:14.157 --> 53:16.359
- You gotta go.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.227
- Can't do it.

53:17.227 --> 53:18.328
I don't know why.

53:20.897 --> 53:23.333

53:23.333 --> 53:24.301
- I know, look

53:24.301 --> 53:25.435

- Hold the fucking gun right.

53:25.435 --> 53:27.337
- How you gonna murder me?

53:27.337 --> 53:28.171
Goddammit, try again.

53:28.171 --> 53:29.773
All right, get in, lemme get you in.

54:21.424 --> 54:23.260

54:31.167 --> 54:32.002

I don't speak English.

You're the one that's

55:03.800 --> 55:05.135
We shall not be moved.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.836
I'm silent-protesting right now.

55:06.836 --> 55:08.705
- You are doing a lot of
things not silent, bro,

55:08.705 --> 55:09.539
judging by yourself.

55:09.539 --> 55:10.874
- I'm ordering Uber Eats for me and you,

55:10.874 --> 55:11.708
What you want?

55:11.708 --> 55:13.710

55:21.318 --> 55:22.919

vegan with this shirt.

55:22.919 --> 55:24.020
- Nigga are you vegan?

55:24.020 --> 55:25.221

55:26.389 --> 55:27.390
I'm trying to see why you got

55:27.390 --> 55:28.758

55:28.758 --> 55:29.793

55:29.793 --> 55:30.627
- Man, you know-

Come on, hey, money,

55:55.318 --> 55:56.152

56:07.364 --> 56:08.665

56:18.608 --> 56:20.343

56:20.343 --> 56:22.345
One thing you need to know.

56:22.345 --> 56:24.180
- Get your hands off me, bro.

56:24.180 --> 56:26.349

56:31.554 --> 56:34.157
It's night time, you get

56:36.092 --> 56:37.961
- Hey, well, shit, like
my grand mama said,

56:37.961 --> 56:39.496

56:50.774 --> 56:53.176

but since we got your money

57:09.459 --> 57:11.995
the night before in the morning...

57:11.995 --> 57:13.096
- You can have the boots.

57:13.096 --> 57:14.164
- You can have the boot.

57:14.164 --> 57:15.331
- Tell him again.

57:15.331 --> 57:18.668

57:18.668 --> 57:20.336
- Money, yeah.

57:20.336 --> 57:21.571
- All that little nasty shit,

57:21.571 --> 57:23.673

You okay? What's going on?

58:26.836 --> 58:27.871
You see that out there.

58:27.871 --> 58:28.705
Ridiculous.

58:28.705 --> 58:29.706
Won't he do it?

58:29.706 --> 58:30.807
Won't I do it?

58:30.807 --> 58:32.208
You know, something
like that makes me think

58:32.208 --> 58:33.910
about what Kevin Hart used to say to him.

58:33.910 --> 58:36.212
He used to throw flames on them.

58:36.212 --> 58:37.847
Throw flames.

58:37.847 --> 58:39.449
Throw flames.

58:39.449 --> 58:40.950
Throw flame flames.

58:40.950 --> 58:42.886

Oh, I feel like doing it.

58:44.220 --> 58:45.722

58:45.722 --> 58:49.459
Flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame.

58:49.459 --> 58:52.829
Flame, flame, flame,
flame, flame, flame, flame.

59:23.626 --> 59:24.894
- Where your mom at?

59:25.995 --> 59:27.363
Where?

59:27.363 --> 59:28.197
Which one?

59:29.198 --> 59:30.333
Go on over there,

59:30.333 --> 59:31.167
you don't need to be sitting right here.

59:31.167 --> 59:33.136
This ain't no goddamn Toys R Us.
