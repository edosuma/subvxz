WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.604
( Screams )

00:13.263 --> 00:14.139
( sighs )

00:14.348 --> 00:15.691
I just had a horrible dream

00:15.891 --> 00:18.019
that Gideon stole the deed
to the Mystery Shack

00:18.227 --> 00:19.069
and kicked us out

00:19.269 --> 00:21.988
and we all had to move in
with Soos's grandma.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.444
That was no dream, dude.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.651
( Screams )

00:27.027 --> 00:28.620
Sh <i>h!
Por favor.</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:30.822
<i>Uh, sorry,
Abuelita.</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:34.376
Oh! Soos, your grandma
is so adorable!

00:34.576 --> 00:37.045
And her skin
is old lady soft.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.169
( Sighing )

00:39.373 --> 00:41.751
Mabel, quit being creepy!
The news is finally on!

00:41.959 --> 00:44.132
<i>In a move that has
all of Gravity Falls buzzing,</i>

00:44.336 --> 00:45.758
<i>child psychic Gideon Gleeful</i>

00:45.963 --> 00:48.307
<i>has taken surprise ownership
of the Mystery Shack,</i>

00:48.507 --> 00:51.556
<i>previously belonging to area
shyster Stanford Pines.</i>

00:51.927 --> 00:53.975
That picture's
taken out of context.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.522
<i>Now that you have the shack,</i>

00:55.722 --> 00:57.941
<i>what exactly are you
planning to do with it?</i>

00:58.141 --> 00:59.814
<i>I have a big announcement
to make today,</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:01.270
<i>and I'd like
to cordially invite</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:03.947
<i>all the good people
of Gravity Falls to join me.</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.900
<i>Free admission to everyone
who wears their Gideon pins!</i>

01:07.109 --> 01:08.406
<i>It's my face!</i>

01:08.652 --> 01:10.746
I just can't believe
Gideon beat us!

01:10.946 --> 01:12.744
Normally I'm able
to save the day.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.245
This is all my fault.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.245
Don't worry, Dipper.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.420
Looks like Mabel's gonna have to
be the hero of the family now!

01:18.620 --> 01:21.920
I'll defeat Gideon
with my grappling hook!

01:22.791 --> 01:24.759
Mabel, no offense,
but that grappling hook

01:24.960 --> 01:26.587
has literally
never helped us once.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.797
Oh, yeah? Jelly grab!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.017
I vacuum the walls now.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.098
So you lost the shack.
Look on the bright side, dudes.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.432
Now you get to live
here with me.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.391
Soos!

01:39.725 --> 01:41.022
Hey, anyone wanna
play racecars?

01:41.226 --> 01:42.694
They're out of batteries,
but we can make pretend.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.864
( Gags and coughs )
Would it be a new low if I ate that?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.234
( Chuckles ) I'm just kidding.
I'm totally eating it.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.282
We've gotta
get the Shack back.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.824
Hello, Gravity Falls!

02:37.032 --> 02:39.911
( Spectators cheering )

02:40.619 --> 02:42.246
Gideon is
the psychic-est!

02:42.454 --> 02:45.458
He guessed the secret ingredient
to my coffee omelet!

02:45.666 --> 02:49.261
Somehow he knew about my
horrifying secret birthmark.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.763
I love that
child psychic so much!

02:51.963 --> 02:53.215
( Grunts )
You're choking me!

02:53.423 --> 02:55.016
Grandma, is that you?

02:55.592 --> 02:56.343
We're in.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.140
Just wanna say, don't know
what we're doing here,

02:58.345 --> 03:00.939
but I am loving these
fake moustaches!

03:01.139 --> 03:03.938
If anyone asks,
I'm not Soos.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.024
Ladies and gentlemen!

03:06.228 --> 03:09.198
Today I am delighted
to announce my new plans

03:09.398 --> 03:10.900
for the former Mystery Shack.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.448
I give you Gideonland!

03:14.653 --> 03:15.529
- What?H
- Dude!

03:15.737 --> 03:17.455
We're gonna turn
this dirty old shack

03:17.656 --> 03:21.456
into three square miles
of Gideon-tertainment!

03:22.119 --> 03:24.588
And, introducing
our new mascot,

03:24.788 --> 03:26.335
Li'I Gideon junior!

03:26.540 --> 03:27.837
Boom! He's a pig!

03:28.625 --> 03:30.844
Waddles! You monster!

03:31.086 --> 03:32.759
All right, that's it!

03:32.963 --> 03:34.340
Hey!Hey!

03:34.548 --> 03:36.767
( Grunting and panting )

03:36.967 --> 03:39.015
Listen up, people!
Gideon's a fraud!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.392
This kid broke in
and stole my property!

03:41.596 --> 03:43.598
- Arrest him, officers!
- Yeah!

03:43.807 --> 03:45.309
Such accusations!

03:45.600 --> 03:48.570
Mr. Pines, I recall
you gave the property to me.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.522
Look, here's the deed
right here!

03:50.689 --> 03:52.441
Well, that's all the proof
I need to see.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.903
I love you, Li'l Gideon!
Sing them funny songs!

03:57.487 --> 03:58.158
Hey!

03:58.572 --> 03:59.619
( Gasping )

04:00.657 --> 04:02.876
Now get off my property,
old man.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.919
I'll show you
who's the old ma--

04:05.120 --> 04:06.963
Ow! Aah! My hearing aid!
Aah! (grunting )

04:07.164 --> 04:09.041
Thanks for visiting
Gideonland, friends!

04:09.249 --> 04:12.503
( Chuckles ) Don't come back.
I don't care for y'all.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.468
(all sigh )

04:16.005 --> 04:16.848
( grunts with exertion )

04:17.089 --> 04:19.309
Don't worry, guys, we'll get
the Shack back somehow.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.305
We better.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.226
Wendy!

04:21.553 --> 04:22.805
If I can't work
at the Shack,

04:23.013 --> 04:24.390
my dad's gonna force me
to work upstate

04:24.639 --> 04:26.107
at my cousin's
logging camp.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.860
What? You're leaving town?
But we need you here!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.776
Yeah, especially Dipper,
because of his giant crush on...

04:33.356 --> 04:36.326
You. Calyptus trees!

04:36.526 --> 04:38.278
( Nervous chuckle )
The kid loves eucalyptus trees.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.331
( Chuckling )
Saved it!

04:41.907 --> 04:43.909
Oh, man, guys,
don't look now.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.334
Take me back, Wendy!

04:45.535 --> 04:48.254
My arms are too skinny to keep holding
this boom box forever!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.753
- I was never here.
- Have you been getting my texts?

04:50.957 --> 04:53.585
Do I need to send you
more texts? Wendy!

04:55.212 --> 04:58.261
This is not good. I cannot
feed such a big family.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.012
Where will we stay, Dipper?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.219
Where will I put
all my sweaters?

05:02.469 --> 05:04.392
And what's Stan
gonna tell Mom and Dad?

05:04.596 --> 05:07.725
Ah, Mr. Pines will figure
something out. He always does!

05:09.184 --> 05:11.107
Don't worry, your son
and daughter are fine.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.521
Where are we staying?

05:12.729 --> 05:15.357
Uh, I put 'em up at this
amazing 4-star hotel!

05:17.234 --> 05:20.784
What? Uh, sure, we got...
Plenty to eat.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.245
Uh, relax. If I thought I couldn't
take care of these kids,

05:24.449 --> 05:27.749
I'd send 'em back right away.
Uh-huh. You, too.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.422
Grunkle Stan,
can we order pizza?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.792
( Sighs )

05:40.048 --> 05:42.221
( laughs )

05:43.176 --> 05:45.178
( blows whistle )
Back to your corner!

05:50.267 --> 05:51.689
I've been meanin'
to ask you, boy.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.645
Shouldn't you be
celebratin' Gideonland

05:53.854 --> 05:56.107
instead of sticking your head
in that there book all day?

05:56.439 --> 05:59.568
Father, have I ever told you
the true nature of this book?

06:00.235 --> 06:03.159
It was written many years ago
by a brilliant unknown author

06:03.363 --> 06:06.287
who learned secrets
too powerful for one man.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.869
He hid his journals where he
thought no one would ever find 'em.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.663
Because he knew that if the journals
were ever brought together,

06:11.872 --> 06:15.547
they would unleash a gateway
to unimaginable power!

06:16.710 --> 06:17.927
Codes and maps
have led me to believe

06:18.128 --> 06:20.426
the other book's buried somewhere
on this very property.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.348
And I intend to find it.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.018
So that's why you
wanted the Mystery Shack.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.310
That's right, Father.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.808
It's time to begin
the search...

06:28.013 --> 06:29.105
For the other journal!

06:35.061 --> 06:36.108
Go, red car!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.781
Go, other red car!

06:39.024 --> 06:40.947
This would be a lot
more fun with batteries.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.156
(grunts)

06:43.445 --> 06:45.914
( clears throat )
Kids, we gotta talk.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.288
Look, I've been thinking, and I
can't take care of you anymore.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.536
I don't have a house,
or-- or a job.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.839
The plan is
you're going home.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.170
Your bus leaves tomorrow.
Here are your tickets.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.671
But, Grunkle Stan,
you can't give up.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.507
Yeah, dude.
Look at these faces!

06:59.711 --> 07:01.759
Be cuter, Mabel!
Your summer depends on it!

07:01.963 --> 07:03.135
Look, I lost, okay?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.433
The best thing is for you to be
with your parents.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.011
I'm sorry, kids.
Gideon won.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.350
Summer's over.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.482
Mr. Pines! Come back!
Reconsider!

07:13.892 --> 07:15.189
Mabel, that's enough!

07:15.393 --> 07:17.361
If Stan won't get
our home back from Gideon,

07:17.562 --> 07:19.064
then we'll have
to do it ourselves!

07:19.272 --> 07:20.819
Gideon may have
the upper hand,

07:21.024 --> 07:23.197
but we have one thing
he doesn't.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.823
- A grappling hook!
- The journal!

07:25.028 --> 07:28.123
Oh, the journal.
Journal!

07:38.208 --> 07:40.552
All right. The bus to take us
out of Gravity Falls

07:40.752 --> 07:41.844
comes at sundown.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.047
If we wanna stay in town,
we've gotta get past those guards,

07:44.339 --> 07:45.340
make it through the fence,

07:45.548 --> 07:47.596
and get Gideon
to hand over that deed.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.687
Leave that to Mabel!
Wa-cha!

07:51.179 --> 07:53.056
Aah! (grunts)

07:53.264 --> 07:55.358
Now will you admit
the grappling hook is useless?

07:56.017 --> 07:56.813
Nope!

07:57.018 --> 07:59.487
Okay, what can we use
to defeat Gideon?

07:59.896 --> 08:02.194
Let's see. Barf fairy?

08:02.399 --> 08:03.946
- Yeah!
- Nope.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.029
Butternut squash with a
human face and emotions?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.705
- Yeah!
- Nope.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.532
Whoa! What's this?

08:10.740 --> 08:12.083
I've stared at
this page for hours.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.751
It seems like a blueprint
to build some kind

08:13.952 --> 08:15.829
of strange futuristic
super weapon--

08:16.037 --> 08:19.837
Boring! To defeat those guards,
we need some kind of army.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.381
Wait a minute. An army!

08:23.003 --> 08:25.381
Mabel, that's it!
The gnomes!

08:26.006 --> 08:28.134
Uh...

08:30.051 --> 08:31.769
I think this is
their hiding spot.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.481
I wonder what gnomes do out here
all alone in the forest.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.352
Both: Aah!

08:35.557 --> 08:37.183
( Scatting ) Aah!

08:37.767 --> 08:39.565
This, this is normal.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.988
This is normal for gnomes.
Scrub, scrub.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.696
Well, well, well!
Look who came crawling back!

08:45.900 --> 08:48.278
Take five, Chris. You guys keep doin'
what you're doin'.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.827
So, changed your mind about
marrying me, did you, Mabel?

08:52.115 --> 08:56.245
Ew! Hardly! We need your help.
And seriously, ew!

08:56.494 --> 09:00.089
You want our help? After you left me
at the altar? No dice!

09:00.290 --> 09:02.088
Well, what if we were able to
get you a new queen?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.794
One even more
beautiful than me!

09:04.002 --> 09:06.755
Her name's Gideon
and she has lovely white hair.

09:06.963 --> 09:11.013
Whoa! Mature woman, huh?
Hey, Shmebulock, get my cologne!

09:11.217 --> 09:12.560
Shmebulock!

09:13.011 --> 09:14.934
Is "Shmebulock"
all you can say?

09:16.139 --> 09:17.812
Shmebulock.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.108
It's a deal!

09:21.895 --> 09:23.613
Waiter, give me a glass
of the strongest,

09:23.813 --> 09:25.815
most expired
apple cider you've got.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.276
Sure thing, Mr. Pines.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.160
Soos? What are you
doing here?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.486
Since the Mystery Shack
shut down,

09:30.695 --> 09:32.413
I've had to take a bunch
of part-time jobs.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.458
Grave digger, bus driver,
really awesome cook.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.285
Hey, is the kitchen supposed to
have that much fire in it?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.121
( Woman screams )

09:40.497 --> 09:43.922
( sighs ) You're
a good man-child, Soos,

09:44.125 --> 09:45.172
but it's not looking good.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.420
This whole town loves
Gideon and hates me.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.973
If only they knew
how evil he really was.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.217
Hey, I'm here
for you, dude.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.473
The entire lower half
of your body is on fire.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.307
Shh. We're having
a moment.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.517
Where are you, journal?

10:01.976 --> 10:03.148
Where are you?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.902
Boy, I hate to interrupt you,
but you have some guests.

10:06.106 --> 10:06.902
What?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.735
Give us the deed to
the shack, Gideon! Or else!

10:09.943 --> 10:12.446
Am I supposed to say,
"or else what?"

10:12.779 --> 10:15.828
Yes, you are supposed
to say that! Now!

10:16.074 --> 10:16.996
( Both grunt )

10:17.200 --> 10:18.247
( Qasps )

10:18.618 --> 10:21.918
( laughil19 )

10:22.497 --> 10:24.215
( gasping )

10:27.085 --> 10:29.554
You're surrounded by
an unstoppable gnome army.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.140
Now give us back our deed
and get off our property!

10:32.340 --> 10:35.093
And let the marriage
ceremony begin!

10:35.301 --> 10:39.226
( Sighs ) Very well. I suppose
this deed belongs to--

10:39.430 --> 10:42.604
( shrill whistle )

10:43.101 --> 10:45.650
Ha! What do you know?
Works on gnomes, too.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.773
Stop! We'll do anything!

10:47.981 --> 10:49.949
How can we serve you,
your majesty?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.403
The most beautiful girl
we've ever seen!

10:52.610 --> 10:54.112
I am not a girl!

10:54.362 --> 10:57.707
Really? But your skin is so soft.
Do you moisturize or...

10:57.907 --> 10:58.874
Subdue them!

10:59.492 --> 11:01.586
( Overlapping grunting )

11:01.786 --> 11:04.505
I have to admit, kids,
I am impressed by your creativity.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.291
- How did you ever?
- Let go!

11:06.749 --> 11:07.375
Oh, no!

11:07.584 --> 11:10.007
No! Could it be? Is it?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.179
-( Gasps )
-( laughs ) Of course!

11:12.380 --> 11:13.757
It all makes sense!

11:13.965 --> 11:15.558
The one place I'd
never think to look.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.884
You had it the whole time!

11:17.093 --> 11:19.596
And to think I actually
considered you a threat!

11:19.846 --> 11:21.098
No! Give it back!

11:21.264 --> 11:23.983
Every victory you had was because
of your precious book!

11:24.184 --> 11:25.731
- Give it back or I'll--
- Or you'll what, boy?

11:25.935 --> 11:29.735
You'll what? Huh? Huh?
No muscles, no brains.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.408
Face it. You're
nothing without this!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.368
Bye-bye forever,
y'all.

11:34.861 --> 11:35.532
( Whistles )

11:35.737 --> 11:37.580
[[511

11:46.122 --> 11:48.966
Next time, do your own dirty work!
Come on, boys!

11:51.502 --> 11:52.754
Well, that's it.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.593
Guess the bus
should be here soon.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.305
What? Dipper,
don't give up!

11:57.675 --> 11:59.268
You always
have a plan!

11:59.552 --> 12:01.304
No, the journal always
has the plan!

12:01.554 --> 12:03.556
Think about it, Mabel.
Gideon was right.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.767
The only courageous
or cool things I've ever done

12:06.017 --> 12:07.394
have been because
of that journal.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.989
Without it, I can't help you
or Stan or anyone.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.567
There's gotta be
something we can do.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.993
What can we do?

12:19.447 --> 12:21.996
Man: Bus fifty-two departing
Gravity Falls. All aboard.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.132
Sorry, kids.
It's for the best.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.131
Can't believe
this is happening.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.559
( Giggles ) I've got it!
I've finally got it!

12:48.351 --> 12:49.523
- Get out!
-( exclaims )

12:49.978 --> 12:51.150
It's finally mine!

12:51.521 --> 12:53.819
At last, I have
journal number...

12:54.232 --> 12:55.199
Three?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.201
There are three of 'em?

12:57.860 --> 13:00.079
But where is
journal number one?

13:00.488 --> 13:03.162
I must have all three for
the power to be unlocked!

13:03.366 --> 13:07.166
But where could I-- Dipper!
He must know where it is!

13:07.370 --> 13:09.998
He gave me the third one
and kept the first for himself!

13:10.206 --> 13:12.584
I can't let him leave
Gravity Falls!

13:15.211 --> 13:16.884
You there! Is it ready?

13:19.841 --> 13:22.060
Only one way to find out!

13:41.654 --> 13:42.280
(grunts)

13:49.245 --> 13:51.543
I got a good feelin'
about that kid!

13:52.915 --> 13:55.384
Well, Stan, this is it.
Rock bottom.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.303
No friends, no family,

13:57.503 --> 13:59.676
stuck watching infomercials
for whatever that is.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.885
<i>Are you sick of piles of owls
constantly blocking your driveway?</i>

14:03.051 --> 14:05.304
<i>Well, then you've
gotta get Owl Trowel!</i>

14:06.054 --> 14:07.271
HOW did you do it, kid?

14:07.764 --> 14:09.482
Why are you always
one step ahead?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.775
Maybe he really is
psychic after--

14:11.976 --> 14:13.023
-( ringing sound )
- Aah! My hearing aid!

14:13.186 --> 14:14.813
What keeps causing that?

14:15.229 --> 14:18.449
Wait a minute. That's it!
I know Gideon's weakness!

14:18.649 --> 14:20.071
Would Mr. Pines like a--

14:20.276 --> 14:21.277
Mwah!

14:23.738 --> 14:25.706
I go vacuum my face.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.384
Hey, Dipper. Wanna play
bus seat treasure hunt?

14:36.626 --> 14:37.718
I'm not in the mood.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.878
Oh, come on.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.088
We got Canadian coin,

14:40.254 --> 14:42.222
gum that's shaped like
Ronald Reagan's head.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.425
Ooh! Miscellaneous
fluid stain.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.017
- Giant robot!
- Yeah, giant robot. Wait. What?

14:48.221 --> 14:52.567
- Look!
- Halt! I command you to halt!

14:52.809 --> 14:54.152
( Both scream )

14:54.394 --> 14:57.989
Mr. bus driver! There's a giant
Gideonbot coming towards us!

14:58.272 --> 15:00.149
- Oh, hey, dudes!
- Both: Soos!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.494
Don't worry, guys.
I've been a part-time bus driver

15:02.735 --> 15:03.952
for at least 40 minutes.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.122
One of these things
is probably a clutch.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.161
Hang on, dudes!

15:09.325 --> 15:10.201
Aah!

15:11.119 --> 15:13.872
- Soos! Look out!
- Aah!

15:15.206 --> 15:16.423
( All scream )

15:22.547 --> 15:24.720
He already won!
What does he want from us?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.602
I got you in my sights!

15:28.803 --> 15:29.975
Soos! Cliff!

15:30.638 --> 15:32.140
-( All scream )
-( grunt of exertion )

15:33.099 --> 15:33.975
Soos: Aah!

15:45.194 --> 15:46.821
(all screaming )

15:48.823 --> 15:50.917
Okay, what's closest
to our present situation?

15:51.367 --> 15:54.291
"Raccoon in the engine" or
"angry grandparent won't leave bus"?

15:54.871 --> 15:55.963
Probably-- probably
the second one.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.251
( Panting ) Huh?

16:06.090 --> 16:08.559
Tell me! Where is
journal number one?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.390
Both:
Journal number one?

16:10.845 --> 16:13.064
Don't play games
with me, boy!

16:13.514 --> 16:14.766
'Oh!
- Aah! Aah'

16:15.391 --> 16:16.608
I don't know what
you're talking about!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.607
You took the only
journal I ever had!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.813
What do you even want
with these journals, anyway?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.732
Both: Aah! Aah!

16:23.983 --> 16:26.281
-( Audibly struggling )
- Let go of her!

16:26.611 --> 16:29.615
Ha ha ha! You still think
you're some kind of hero?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.741
Aaahhh! Unh!

16:32.408 --> 16:33.204
(groans)

16:33.409 --> 16:36.288
Once I find the final journal,
I'll rule this town!

16:36.496 --> 16:39.340
With you as my queen!
( laughs )

16:39.540 --> 16:42.089
Dipper' he") me!
Help!

16:45.755 --> 16:48.508
<i>Gideon: Face it, kid. You're nothing
without that journal.</i>

16:48.716 --> 16:49.808
<i>How you gonna fight back?</i>

16:50.134 --> 16:52.011
<i>No muscles, no brains.</i>

16:52.220 --> 16:55.349
<i>What are you gonna do? Huh?
What are you gonna do?</i>

17:00.269 --> 17:04.775
(yelling )

17:06.817 --> 17:08.285
Let go of my sister!

17:09.945 --> 17:12.290
Never! I finally
won this time!

17:12.531 --> 17:13.909
( Fighting grunts )

17:14.116 --> 17:16.539
Aah! Aah! Get off!
Let go of me!

17:23.334 --> 17:25.051
'( Grunts )
'( grunts ) Huh?

17:30.508 --> 17:32.727
( Audible struggling )

17:33.052 --> 17:36.056
( screaming )

17:36.389 --> 17:37.891
Careful in there!

17:40.518 --> 17:42.896
( Screaming )

17:43.187 --> 17:45.155
Dudes! No!

18:09.046 --> 18:12.266
Grappling hook!
Told you it would come in handy.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.143
Mabel,
that was amazing!

18:14.385 --> 18:17.138
Not as amazing as you
defeating that robot!

18:17.346 --> 18:18.313
Hey, my journal!

18:19.765 --> 18:21.267
- Man: Oh, there it is!
- Man #2: Is this the thing that exploded?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.398
- What's going on?
- What is that?

18:23.603 --> 18:24.445
It's over here.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.522
Ohhh.

18:27.857 --> 18:28.733
Gideon!

18:29.483 --> 18:32.282
Oh, good heavens!
What on earth happened here?

18:32.570 --> 18:35.164
It was the Pines twins.
They tried to attack me

18:35.364 --> 18:37.537
and blew up my statue
with dynamite!

18:37.867 --> 18:38.663
Arrest 'em!

18:39.035 --> 18:41.538
- Both: What?
- Officers, he's lying!

18:41.829 --> 18:43.627
Sorry, kids,
but we trust Gideon,

18:43.831 --> 18:45.708
and nothing short of a miracle
could ever change our--

18:45.916 --> 18:48.385
( Screaming
Aah! )

18:48.961 --> 18:51.840
Wait! Wait! Stop everything!
I've got something to say!

18:52.048 --> 18:54.426
- Not this guy again.
- Just wait! Look!

18:55.009 --> 18:57.888
You guys all think Gideon
is so perfect and honest.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.393
"Oh, I could never
tell a lie! I'm Gideon!"

19:00.598 --> 19:01.850
He's more honest
than <i>you!</i>

19:02.058 --> 19:03.731
Yeah!
And he's psychic too!

19:03.934 --> 19:09.065
How's this for psychic?
Bam! Take a good look!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.864
Wait a minute!
Is that me?

19:13.069 --> 19:16.824
The secret ingredient
to my coffee omelet is coffee!

19:17.239 --> 19:18.240
And me!

19:18.449 --> 19:20.577
I can verify that that
birthmark is indeed disgusting.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.078
Hooray!

19:22.244 --> 19:24.793
Onlookers:
That's me!

19:24.997 --> 19:26.999
That's right! These pins
are hidden cameras!

19:27.291 --> 19:29.840
And my hearing aid was
picking up the feedback!

19:30.169 --> 19:32.012
Who's the fraud now?

19:36.258 --> 19:38.807
Gideon,
we gave you our trust.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.684
You lied to us!

19:40.888 --> 19:43.061
Please, I-- ( gasps )
It's not what it looks like.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.067
What are you
gonna do with me?

19:45.893 --> 19:46.815
Tyler?

19:49.230 --> 19:49.947
Get him.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.115
( Sniffles )
Get him.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.611
-( Gasps )
- Li'l Gideon, you are under arrest...

19:54.819 --> 19:57.823
For conspiracy, fraud,
and breaking our hearts.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.165
Durland,
the tiny handcuffs.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.293
Wha-- no!

20:05.579 --> 20:06.796
Just one more thing.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.716
Let go of me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:10.209 --> 20:12.086
I believe
this belongs to me.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.465
No! No! Watch the hair!

20:15.715 --> 20:17.683
You can't do this to me!
Y'all are sheep!

20:17.925 --> 20:19.518
You need me!
I'll be back!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.016
You'll hear
from my lawyers!

20:21.220 --> 20:22.096
There you have it.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.690
Local hero Stanford Pines
has just exposed

20:24.682 --> 20:26.309
Li'I Gideon as a fraud.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.440
Anything you have to say
to the town, Stanford?

20:28.644 --> 20:31.193
The Mystery Shack
is back, baby!

20:32.106 --> 20:34.780
( Iaughil19 )

20:35.067 --> 20:36.159
( sighs )

20:44.118 --> 20:47.873
( laughs )
Oh, thank you, thank you!

20:49.373 --> 20:50.841
( Champs )

20:53.169 --> 20:56.719
( mewing )
Hey, Grunkle Stan!

20:56.922 --> 20:59.220
Uh, you kiddos
settling back in okay?

20:59.425 --> 21:00.972
Yep! All of my
favorite moldy spots

21:01.177 --> 21:02.895
on the ceiling
are still there!

21:03.179 --> 21:05.728
Even you, Daryl!

21:06.348 --> 21:08.851
Hey, Grunkle Stan, me and Mabel
have been talking,

21:09.101 --> 21:11.069
and I think there's something
we should finally tell you.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.322
This is a journal
I found in the woods.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.149
It talks about
all the crazy stuff that

21:15.357 --> 21:16.859
goes on in Gravity Falls.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.490
Gideon nearly destroyed
the whole town trying to find it.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.447
I don't know what it means,
or who wrote it,

21:21.655 --> 21:23.123
but after all
we've been through,

21:23.657 --> 21:25.705
maybe you should
finally know about it.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.628
I'm glad you
showed me this, Dipper.

21:28.662 --> 21:32.041
( laughs ) Now I know where you've
been getting it all from!

21:32.041 --> 21:33.668
Spookums and monsters.

21:33.876 --> 21:37.221
This kooky book has been filling
your head with crazy conspiracies!

21:37.421 --> 21:38.297
But it's all real!

21:38.506 --> 21:42.227
( laughs ) You gotta quit readin'
this fantasy nonsense for your own good.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.053
Although some of these
would make great attractions!

21:44.261 --> 21:46.730
Can't come up with this stuff!
Mind if I borrow this?

21:46.972 --> 21:48.315
Wait! No! Grunkle Stan!

21:48.474 --> 21:50.943
( laughingly)
"Magic book." Ridiculous!

21:51.143 --> 21:54.272
- Stan, I need it!
- Dipper, you don't need that book!

21:54.522 --> 21:55.523
Don't you see?

21:55.731 --> 21:57.825
On your own you
defeated a giant robot

21:58.025 --> 21:59.698
with nothing
but your bare hands!

21:59.902 --> 22:02.200
You're a hero whether you've
got that journal or not!

22:02.404 --> 22:06.284
Whoa. Thanks, Mabel.
I still want it back though.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.709
I'm sure
you'll get it back.

22:07.910 --> 22:11.255
What would a boring old man like
Stan want with that book anyway?

22:11.455 --> 22:13.753
-( Both gasp )
- Soos'ed!

22:13.916 --> 22:16.795
( Both laughing )

22:58.335 --> 22:59.962
After all these years.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.684
Finally, I have them all.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.646
It's working!

23:22.067 --> 23:22.989
( Grunts with exertion )

23:30.701 --> 23:32.044
Here we go.
