WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:01.890
Previously on "The Mist"...

00:01.890 --> 00:04.220
Team wanna celebrate tonight.
Do you want to come?

00:04.220 --> 00:05.490
Alex is not old enough
for a party.

00:05.490 --> 00:06.760
The last thing I remember

00:06.760 --> 00:08.560
is someone helping me upstairs.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.230
Why? What's going on?

00:10.230 --> 00:11.770
You're being investigated
for sexual assault.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.560
The legend of nature
turning sour.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.000
Sweetie, I believed you'd stop

00:15.000 --> 00:16.730
looking for conspiracy theories.

00:16.730 --> 00:18.650
You know Dr. Kleerick
says it's not good for you.

00:22.610 --> 00:25.010
My family's at the mall.
I've gotta get to them.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.810
I'd like to make a toast
for my husband.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.140
Aah!

00:28.140 --> 00:30.110
Maybe he's still here in spirit?

00:30.110 --> 00:32.009
- There is no spirit.
- What are you doing?

00:32.020 --> 00:33.680
I want to feel better than I do.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.280
He doesn't have to know,
but the pills stay.

00:35.290 --> 00:36.590
How can I help?

00:36.590 --> 00:38.090
You can avoid
Eve and Alex Copeland.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

02:11.550 --> 02:12.820
You look like shit.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.780
Sorry.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.790
You okay?

02:23.990 --> 02:25.730
What are you thinking about?

02:25.730 --> 02:27.330
Talk to me.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.810
- You don't want to know.
- It's okay.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.640
What if they're all dead?

02:33.700 --> 02:34.700
They're not.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.100
But what if they are?

02:36.110 --> 02:37.410
We haven't seen or heard
from anyone.

02:37.410 --> 02:38.410
They're fine.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.350
She's the only friend I have.

02:42.350 --> 02:44.110
She's okay.

02:44.110 --> 02:45.110
You don't know that.

02:45.110 --> 02:46.110
I do.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.020
I do.

02:51.890 --> 02:54.190
We have to get going, all right?

02:54.190 --> 02:55.290
Out there? How?

02:55.290 --> 02:56.290
Come on.

03:06.840 --> 03:07.840
Come here.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.540
There. Look.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.540
See that?

03:16.210 --> 03:18.210
What if it
doesn't have any keys?

03:18.210 --> 03:20.280
I bet Mia
knows how to hot-wire.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.680
I don't trust her.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.520
Plus, she's kinda
cuffed right now.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.960
Yeah, I'll talk to Connor.
He'll understand.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.110
I used to bring you to
this mall when you were a baby.

03:43.110 --> 03:45.110
Something about
the ambient noise

03:45.110 --> 03:46.910
helped put you to sleep.

03:50.650 --> 03:53.850
When you got older,
we went here with Dad.

03:57.990 --> 04:00.430
He always got you a balloon.
Remember?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.100
Please talk to me.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.570
It's okay to be scared
about what happened.

04:14.570 --> 04:15.770
I'm scared, too.

04:15.770 --> 04:17.570
Scared?

04:17.570 --> 04:19.810
About which thing?

04:19.810 --> 04:22.410
There are so many options.

04:22.410 --> 04:26.410
Should I be scared about
the people who hung themselves

04:26.420 --> 04:28.990
or that big cloud
of whatever-it-is outside?

04:28.990 --> 04:30.690
Or do you mean
that I'm stuck in this mall

04:30.690 --> 04:32.190
with the guy who raped me?

04:34.760 --> 04:37.400
I'm working on that last part.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.100
I just...

04:46.670 --> 04:49.270
I wish you'd tell me
what you're feeling.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.880
Who says I'm feeling anything?

05:02.120 --> 05:03.660
Here.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.730
It's from
that fancy kitchen store.

05:10.730 --> 05:13.230
- What?
- Eh, the knife.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.900
That place on the second floor
where all the newlyweds go.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.130
Oh.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.460
Wait.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.400
Look.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.570
She's Army.

05:59.410 --> 06:01.280
Maybe he is, too.

06:11.350 --> 06:13.620
Why the hell
is the military here?

06:29.440 --> 06:32.740
We found these
when we cut them down.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.180
They were military.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.110
Maybe they went AWOL
or something?

06:38.110 --> 06:40.510
So they killed themselves
just when they got off the base?

06:40.520 --> 06:42.455
Either way,
they can't stay here.

06:42.456 --> 06:45.120
Enough bacteria to close
the food court for life.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.860
Okay, Mr. Proper.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.430
You know, that sad
little game store of yours

06:51.430 --> 06:54.100
has always been
the embarrassment of this place.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.870
If you don't have
anything to contribute,

06:55.870 --> 06:58.740
I suggest you pretend
it's just a normal day

06:58.740 --> 07:00.880
and go and be pointless
on your own turf.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.770
What do we do with them?

07:02.770 --> 07:04.670
They're U.S. soldiers.

07:04.670 --> 07:08.110
If no one's opened the freezer
at the supermarket,

07:08.110 --> 07:11.150
we can maybe put 'em in there.
Might still be cold...

07:11.150 --> 07:12.450
for a little while.

07:16.050 --> 07:18.450
We're gonna have to search
everybody for dog tags.

07:23.730 --> 07:26.130
- You.
- Hey, stop that man!

07:26.130 --> 07:27.830
Get off me! Get off me!

07:34.540 --> 07:35.540
I don't know anything.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.840
Bullshit.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.080
- Why are you here?
- I swear I...

07:39.080 --> 07:40.880
What's out there?! You and
your friends know something.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.580
I'm a private!

07:42.580 --> 07:45.480
Officers don't tell us shit,
just where to drive.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.650
Why would they kill themselves?

07:57.730 --> 08:00.370
Because they know
what's happening out there.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.280
I never thanked you

08:15.280 --> 08:18.050
for helping me yesterday
with the wine.

08:18.050 --> 08:21.920
Yeah, helping people drink,
that's a...

08:21.920 --> 08:23.050
That's a talent of mine.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.860
What do you think it is?

08:29.860 --> 08:32.860
The other day,
I was in my garden,

08:32.860 --> 08:38.429
and a moth landed on my
hand, beautiful creature.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.500
I looked up, and...

08:40.500 --> 08:44.670
suddenly it was as if
all of nature had come alive.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.610
Frogs came out of the soil.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.710
Salamanders
came out of the lake.

08:48.710 --> 08:51.680
Birds seemed as if
they were fleeing.

08:51.680 --> 08:57.090
And then a big toad came up
and ate it right off my hand.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.130
I went to the library,

09:03.130 --> 09:07.500
and I found something similar
happened back in 1860.

09:08.730 --> 09:10.300
The Black Spring.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.870
You know it?

09:11.870 --> 09:15.770
I guess you
didn't grow up around here.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.570
It's a local bedtime story.

09:17.570 --> 09:22.370
It's what you tell kids
to behave in this town.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.415
My mom said
it was a curse on the town

09:24.416 --> 09:26.150
after a young woman
was murdered.

09:26.150 --> 09:28.050
Others said
it's an Indian thing.

09:28.050 --> 09:31.150
It's like our...
Our version of Santa,

09:31.150 --> 09:34.390
but instead of not getting gifts
if you don't behave,

09:34.390 --> 09:36.530
you'll be torn apart alive.

09:38.390 --> 09:41.060
So maybe
this is another Black Spring?

09:44.100 --> 09:48.810
I, uh... I spent
six years in jail

09:48.810 --> 09:51.340
for doing
some pretty awful things,

09:51.340 --> 09:55.110
so, if that was the case,

09:55.110 --> 09:57.910
I'd be the first one gone.

10:04.190 --> 10:06.090
What were you looking at?

10:08.290 --> 10:11.460
That gray shape out there,
you see it?

10:16.200 --> 10:17.270
Maybe.

10:18.470 --> 10:19.470
That's my husband.

10:22.210 --> 10:23.910
That's Benedict.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.150
Do you have two minutes?

10:35.150 --> 10:37.690
I'm stuck in a church.
Fire away.

10:37.690 --> 10:40.160
I know we have
our thing right now.

10:40.160 --> 10:44.160
Can we just put it aside
for a second?

10:44.160 --> 10:45.330
Sure.

10:48.670 --> 10:51.335
Adrian and I
are gonna go to the mall.

10:51.336 --> 10:53.170
I know Eve and Alex are there.

10:53.170 --> 10:54.640
Okay.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.210
I need you to let me take
these two with me.

10:57.210 --> 10:59.340
- Why?
- Because I don't know

10:59.340 --> 11:01.080
what's gonna happen out there,

11:01.080 --> 11:02.920
and the more people we are,
the safer we'll be.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.310
No, I mean why would I do that?

11:05.320 --> 11:06.920
They're prisoners.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.120
No, I know, but these
are extraordinary circumstances.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.120
I think we need
to help each other now.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.620
I'm happy to help,

11:13.620 --> 11:16.960
but an extraordinary situation
seems like a great argument

11:16.960 --> 11:18.800
to not let dangerous people
run in the streets.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.735
She's not dangerous.
She's just loud.

11:20.736 --> 11:22.500
This woman is wanted for murder.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.470
You didn't think about that,
did you?

11:24.470 --> 11:26.270
'Course you didn't.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.770
'Cause you have the privilege

11:27.770 --> 11:29.810
of not being around criminals
every day,

11:29.810 --> 11:31.410
so you can tell yourself

11:31.410 --> 11:33.180
that people like her
are the victims

11:33.180 --> 11:34.740
and I'm the asshole.

11:34.740 --> 11:37.010
She's not gonna hurt anyone.

11:37.010 --> 11:38.850
She saved my life.

11:38.850 --> 11:40.750
I need her help.

11:40.750 --> 11:44.420
You heard him. I'm not...
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.320
What he needs to do
is respect the law,

11:46.320 --> 11:48.320
and what you need to do
is to shut up.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.620
Connor, please, just let her go.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.360
I've known you my entire life.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.200
You keep thinking
this is about me and you.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.270
Of course it's...
Of course it's about us.

11:55.270 --> 11:58.170
No, no, no. This is
about the law, and that's it.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.440
You know what? You're right.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.705
I do think you're an asshole.

12:00.706 --> 12:02.240
I think you became a cop

12:02.240 --> 12:03.710
just 'cause you like
to feel important

12:03.710 --> 12:05.250
and 'cause
you like to arrest people.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.640
Like this?

12:09.250 --> 12:10.450
You got a basement?

12:10.450 --> 12:12.880
- Come on, Connor.
- You, too.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.120
Connor... Come on.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.120
Come on.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.090
Connor.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.570
Oh, yeah, well, that's great.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.340
Thanks a lot.
That's just great.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.570
Hey!

12:33.570 --> 12:34.570
Come on!

12:44.590 --> 12:47.020
I'm cold.

12:47.020 --> 12:48.360
Could you get my jacket?

12:50.930 --> 12:54.530
Here. Take mine.

12:54.530 --> 12:56.170
No, no, no.
Then you're gonna get cold.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.770
Just... Just hand me mine.

12:57.770 --> 12:58.770
Don't worry.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.710
Don't laugh, but it's...

13:08.180 --> 13:11.220
It's like
a security blanket, okay?

13:11.220 --> 13:12.620
Please?

13:20.320 --> 13:21.760
Thank you.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.230
Is this what you're looking for?

13:41.950 --> 13:42.950
Here.

13:53.890 --> 13:55.060
Hey...

14:20.650 --> 14:25.260
What do you say, you and I,
we choose to trust each other?

14:28.030 --> 14:30.200
I could really use
someone to trust.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.140
Okay.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.530
I don't want you
staying close to Jay.

15:00.530 --> 15:04.620
We need to find
another place to set up camp.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.030
Want to help?

15:08.270 --> 15:09.340
Thanks.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.510
We'll be back.
Okay.

15:22.410 --> 15:25.080
"Go be pointless
on your own turf."

15:25.080 --> 15:26.420
Yeah, right.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.820
Could a pointless person
do this?

15:28.820 --> 15:30.490
Whoa.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.160
Hoo hoo! Nice.

15:33.390 --> 15:37.190
When my grandmother died,
I was eight or something.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.860
I asked my mom
if I could take her

15:39.860 --> 15:41.160
to school for show and tell.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.230
What did she say?

15:43.230 --> 15:48.540
She said, "Dead bodies
can't stay above ground.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.140
The air makes them sad."

15:51.910 --> 15:53.680
Yeah, actually,
that's not a bad idea.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.980
What?

15:54.980 --> 15:57.010
A little show and tell?

15:57.010 --> 15:59.010
What if we
put the bodies outside,

15:59.020 --> 16:01.580
use them as bait,
see what shows up?

16:03.320 --> 16:04.750
You're a freaking genius.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.660
Yeah.
Who's pointless now, bitch?

16:12.330 --> 16:14.300
You feeling better now?

16:16.500 --> 16:17.940
A little.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.510
I'm not very good
at thank-yous.

16:22.510 --> 16:23.710
Don't worry about it.

16:27.750 --> 16:32.350
And you're not... looking
for something in return?

16:34.120 --> 16:36.990
What? You're gay, as well?

16:36.990 --> 16:38.090
No.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.360
I don't think so.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.260
Well, what then? Married?

16:46.100 --> 16:50.030
Faithful
to Mrs. Laconic Soldier?

16:50.030 --> 16:52.430
I don't know what I am.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.880
How Zen.

16:57.540 --> 17:00.540
No, um, no, I... I don't know.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.050
What do you mean?

17:06.980 --> 17:08.920
What do you mean?

17:11.020 --> 17:15.190
I woke up in the mountains,
and, uh...

17:15.190 --> 17:16.790
I couldn't even
remember my name.

17:18.530 --> 17:20.630
I remember the dog, and...

17:20.630 --> 17:23.030
I remember the mist came
and killed him,

17:23.030 --> 17:26.069
but, before all that...

17:28.540 --> 17:30.240
I remember nothing.

17:35.610 --> 17:36.740
What?

17:44.060 --> 17:48.490
Guess that... Guess that
makes you the lucky one.

18:10.110 --> 18:12.410
Come on.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.390
Come on. It's okay.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.460
All right.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.260
It's all right.
It's all right.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.430
Okay.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.130
Still want to leave?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.170
Can't stay here another day.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.670
Where are you gonna go?

18:34.670 --> 18:36.210
Talk to Mia.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.180
See if she can hot-wire a car.

18:38.180 --> 18:41.510
If she can,
I'll get them out somehow.

18:41.510 --> 18:43.280
She's a murderer.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.290
Sometimes things are
more complicated than that.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.860
Would you say
the same about Jay?

18:54.360 --> 18:56.190
She did a bad thing.

18:56.190 --> 18:57.860
A person ready to do a bad thing

18:57.860 --> 18:59.730
is not the worst to have around
at the moment.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.900
Stand guard for me, okay?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.400
I'm gonna try to talk to her.

19:08.410 --> 19:09.880
Okay.

19:22.390 --> 19:23.650
Hey.

19:23.650 --> 19:24.890
You hear me?

19:28.290 --> 19:30.460
You okay down there?

19:30.460 --> 19:33.060
Oh, it's the whiny man
from the police station.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.070
I'm gonna get you out, okay?

19:37.340 --> 19:39.840
He says he's gonna get us out.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.240
Thanks.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.280
Soldier boy says thanks.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.845
Do you by any chance
know how to hot-wire a car?

19:46.846 --> 19:48.840
Oh, what,
just because I was in jail,

19:48.850 --> 19:50.490
I'm also a car thief, right?
Shh, shh.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.320
What? You want to ask
the black guy next?

19:52.320 --> 19:54.020
S-Sorry. Sorry.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.150
It's okay.

19:56.150 --> 19:57.590
Of course I do.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.430
Father.

20:09.430 --> 20:10.570
I'm scared.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.470
It's okay.

20:14.870 --> 20:16.440
So am I.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.940
Priests get scared, too.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.950
I don't know if you know this,

20:29.950 --> 20:34.550
but I've known your mother
a very long time.

20:36.430 --> 20:39.000
She loved coming here
when she was younger.

20:40.530 --> 20:45.000
We all need an escape,
and this was hers.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.340
You mean from my dad.

20:53.110 --> 21:00.620
Maybe she was seeking someone
who loved her unconditionally.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.060
You? Creep.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.990
God.

21:06.990 --> 21:08.760
But God doesn't love me.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.130
Of course He does.

21:12.130 --> 21:14.470
Haven't you heard?

21:14.470 --> 21:15.930
I'm a faggot.

21:15.930 --> 21:18.870
I mean,
God's love is everywhere.

21:20.970 --> 21:23.270
It's about accepting it.

21:23.270 --> 21:25.110
How do I do that?

21:25.110 --> 21:31.980
Well, often the first step
is baptism,

21:31.980 --> 21:33.920
to open your heart...

21:35.390 --> 21:36.990
to let the sin out.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.620
Being gay is not a sin.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.320
Isn't lying a sin, Father?

21:42.330 --> 21:44.600
You lied about my son,
didn't you?

21:44.600 --> 21:46.400
No, I didn't.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.500
Then explain something to me.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.870
If you saw what happened,

21:49.870 --> 21:51.940
why didn't you
do something to stop it?

21:51.940 --> 21:55.670
I tried to, but your son's
friends held me back.

21:55.670 --> 21:57.510
No one held you back.

21:57.510 --> 21:59.510
Nothing happened.

21:59.510 --> 22:02.210
You just hate my son because
he's everything that you're not.

22:02.210 --> 22:05.380
Hey! Leave him alone.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.680
My son could go to jail
because of this kid.

22:07.690 --> 22:10.290
He's a rapist.
That's where he belongs.

22:10.290 --> 22:12.630
Your daughter gets drunk
and screws around,

22:12.630 --> 22:14.290
and it's my boy's fault?

22:14.290 --> 22:16.530
But, then again,
that makes perfect sense,

22:16.530 --> 22:17.730
knowing your wife.

22:17.730 --> 22:20.230
Don't you dare.

22:20.230 --> 22:22.170
Like mother, like daughter.

22:26.070 --> 22:27.410
Assaulting an officer.

22:27.410 --> 22:30.210
Seems like it's becoming
an epidemic.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.650
So glad you came to save us.

23:01.860 --> 23:04.530
Okay, as soon
as we get them outside,

23:04.530 --> 23:06.230
get the door closed.

23:23.720 --> 23:24.820
- How long...
- Shh.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.390
Just give it a minute.

23:30.260 --> 23:31.600
Maybe two.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.560
So what's the plan?

23:35.560 --> 23:37.760
We find another place
to camp out.

23:37.770 --> 23:40.630
Just need to find supplies.

23:40.630 --> 23:42.900
I'll get food.
You want to get blankets?

23:42.900 --> 23:45.140
There's a store
a little further down.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.240
Okay.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.910
Okay. Meet you back here.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.950
I just want to talk.

24:31.950 --> 24:33.850
I need to go.
My mom thinks I'm...

24:33.850 --> 24:36.720
Just give me
a few seconds, okay?

24:36.720 --> 24:37.720
Hear me out.

24:39.030 --> 24:41.060
I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:41.060 --> 24:42.390
Want to go?

24:42.400 --> 24:44.200
- Yes.
- Okay.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.200
I'll let you go.

24:48.700 --> 24:49.970
Soon as you've let me talk.

24:53.870 --> 24:56.610
I didn't hurt you,

24:56.610 --> 24:58.250
and I didn't touch you
that night.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.320
I need you to believe me.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.980
I don't.

25:02.980 --> 25:04.620
I liked you.

25:04.620 --> 25:08.390
I stood up for you,
and I stood up for your friend.

25:13.130 --> 25:15.465
I don't know how else
to prove it to you.

25:15.466 --> 25:16.990
You can't. He saw you.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.470
He saw me do what?

25:19.470 --> 25:22.370
He saw you take me upstairs.
He saw me passed out.

25:22.370 --> 25:23.740
And then what?

25:24.810 --> 25:25.810
And then what?

25:30.210 --> 25:35.250
He didn't see shit,
because I took you upstairs...

25:36.480 --> 25:38.250
I took off your shoes...

25:39.490 --> 25:42.320
and I put a blanket on you,

25:42.320 --> 25:44.960
and I left you there alone
to sleep it off.

25:51.170 --> 25:53.235
- Let me touch your hand.
- No.

25:53.236 --> 25:55.130
I want to show you
that nothing happens.

25:57.610 --> 25:59.680
I'll touch it
and just let it go.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.320
Let me touch you.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.120
You see?

26:22.300 --> 26:23.470
I'm not gonna hurt you.

26:52.590 --> 26:54.590
Hey, want some?

26:54.600 --> 26:56.000
No, thanks.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.200
I think I'm gonna go home.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.900
What do you mean?

26:59.900 --> 27:02.970
I'm gonna go home.
I wanted to say goodbye.

27:02.970 --> 27:04.470
I liked your company.

27:05.810 --> 27:07.310
Wait. You want to...

27:07.310 --> 27:08.610
No, Nat... Nathalie, you can't.

27:08.610 --> 27:11.280
It's too dangerous out there.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.050
- We don't know that.
- No, we don't,

27:13.050 --> 27:14.920
so what,
you want to risk your life

27:14.920 --> 27:17.120
just to, what, sit inside
your house instead alone?

27:17.120 --> 27:19.090
I'm not going to my house.
I'm going home.

27:19.090 --> 27:20.390
My home is with him.

27:20.390 --> 27:22.490
What are you doing?

27:22.490 --> 27:23.620
Goodbye.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.390
But you'll die.

27:25.390 --> 27:27.490
I have no business being alive.

27:32.130 --> 27:34.170
Nathalie, please, come in.

27:34.170 --> 27:35.810
Please come back inside.
It isn't safe here.

27:35.800 --> 27:36.800
I'm fine.

27:39.470 --> 27:41.340
Leave me alone, please.
Get back in here.

27:41.340 --> 27:42.780
Please, get in.

27:42.780 --> 27:44.280
You're putting us all in danger!

27:44.280 --> 27:45.820
- I'm gonna shut the door.
- Just... Please.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.580
- It's not safe out here.
- Now!

27:47.580 --> 27:49.450
- It is not safe out here.
- Please, I'm... I'm fine.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.290
Nathalie, it's getting thicker.

27:51.290 --> 27:53.360
Nathalie, it is getting thicker.
Come inside.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.820
Please, it's not safe here.

27:55.820 --> 27:59.030
Please, you... Aah! Aah!

27:59.030 --> 28:00.130
What is that?

28:00.130 --> 28:01.230
There's nothing there.

28:01.230 --> 28:02.600
There's something on me.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.670
Ahh!
There's something on me.

28:06.670 --> 28:08.210
There's something on my back.

28:08.210 --> 28:09.370
Get it off of me.

28:09.370 --> 28:12.040
Nathalie.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.180
There's something there.

28:13.180 --> 28:15.670
Get it off. God.

28:15.680 --> 28:19.210
Aah!

28:19.210 --> 28:20.210
What... What is it?

28:22.380 --> 28:24.120
It's beautiful.

28:30.730 --> 28:31.960
Help me.

28:42.870 --> 28:44.170
Come on. Come on.

28:45.310 --> 28:46.710
Let's get inside.

28:57.150 --> 29:00.120
Now. Now. We gotta go now.

29:01.590 --> 29:02.590
Come on, hurry up!

29:13.860 --> 29:15.200
Why did you go out there?

29:15.200 --> 29:17.430
Did you see it?
Did you see it?

29:17.430 --> 29:18.830
Do you think
it could get in here?

29:18.830 --> 29:20.330
What the hell was that?

29:20.330 --> 29:22.100
- Did you see it?
- Yes, yes. Yes, I saw it,

29:22.100 --> 29:23.430
but why did you go out there?

29:23.440 --> 29:25.710
Because I wanted to die.

29:25.710 --> 29:28.045
- Mrs. Raven, please...
- It's okay.

29:28.046 --> 29:30.710
I don't want to die anymore.
I'm happy.

29:32.450 --> 29:34.580
I've seen God.

29:34.580 --> 29:38.350
Mrs. Raven, you are in shock.
Please.

29:38.350 --> 29:40.890
That wasn't God.

29:42.390 --> 29:45.630
Oh, I'm not talking
about your God.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.540
What's that? I told you
to get blankets, not toys.

30:02.540 --> 30:03.910
Jay was there.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.310
Did he...

30:07.650 --> 30:09.050
I'm okay.

30:10.950 --> 30:13.290
What did he say to you?

30:13.290 --> 30:15.530
That he wasn't going to hurt me.

30:19.560 --> 30:22.430
You won't have to worry
about Jay much longer.

30:30.340 --> 30:32.060
So does this mean
there's nothing out there?

30:34.510 --> 30:36.650
Maybe it's 'cause
the bodies are cold?

30:37.750 --> 30:39.320
What the hell?

30:41.880 --> 30:44.020
Did you put them out there?

30:44.020 --> 30:45.490
What are you, crazy, man?

30:45.490 --> 30:46.760
- You.
- It's too dangerous.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.490
Those are my friends.

30:48.490 --> 30:49.790
Hey! Hey!

30:53.490 --> 30:55.690
- What's going on?
- They put my friends outside!

30:55.700 --> 30:57.700
They're dead. We just want to
see what's going on out there.

30:57.700 --> 30:59.340
They were American soldiers!

31:06.270 --> 31:07.510
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stop it!

31:07.510 --> 31:09.880
- Stop it!
- Now, stop it!

31:09.880 --> 31:11.550
We can't fight each other.

31:11.550 --> 31:13.190
This whole place
is gonna explode.

31:13.190 --> 31:15.180
Then get my friends in.

31:15.180 --> 31:16.820
We were just trying to help.

31:26.290 --> 31:28.560
We can't bring 'em in now.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.660
I'm sorry.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.870
And, you two, for the last time,
stop acting like kids.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.980
I think we need to establish
a set of rules.

32:07.270 --> 32:08.740
We'll be safe here.

32:49.640 --> 32:50.680
Sorry.

32:54.920 --> 32:58.220
I'm trying to understand
what God is telling us.

32:59.990 --> 33:00.990
What have you found?

33:02.360 --> 33:04.760
I believe this is a chance.

33:04.760 --> 33:09.530
I believe He is asking us
to believe in Him.

33:11.870 --> 33:13.970
Then why wouldn't He
send us something good?

33:18.310 --> 33:20.280
Do you know the story of Job?

33:25.480 --> 33:28.080
Job was a devout man...

33:29.720 --> 33:35.290
so devout
that Satan challenged God.

33:35.290 --> 33:39.560
"Job only loves you
for selfish reasons," he said.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.560
"If you take him through misery,
he'll lose his faith."

33:44.900 --> 33:49.400
God accepted the challenge and
took everything away from Job,

33:49.400 --> 33:54.810
let him live in
despair, in pain.

33:54.810 --> 33:56.140
In hell.

33:58.610 --> 34:03.150
But even there, in living hell,

34:03.150 --> 34:06.890
Job never doubted
God's existence,

34:06.890 --> 34:11.260
and Satan lost his bet...

34:11.260 --> 34:13.060
as you do
when you gamble with God.

34:22.469 --> 34:24.940
Were you serious,

34:24.940 --> 34:30.679
what you were telling me
about God loving me?

34:33.280 --> 34:38.790
I believe this is God
begging you to accept His love.

34:43.489 --> 34:48.690
I think... I'd like
to be baptized.

34:50.330 --> 34:52.400
I don't think
I need to remind people

34:52.400 --> 34:54.900
what happened
during Hurricane Katrina.

34:54.900 --> 34:58.670
I will not let this place
sink into chaos.

34:58.670 --> 35:01.510
Now, sooner or later,
someone will come and save us.

35:01.510 --> 35:05.350
Until then, let's make sure
that we all stay together

35:05.350 --> 35:10.550
peacefully and all of us follow
the same set of rules, okay?

35:10.550 --> 35:12.950
What are the rules,
and who gets to decide?

35:12.950 --> 35:14.950
Well, anybody can suggest rules.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.560
Then we vote on 'em.

35:16.560 --> 35:21.060
If the majority is for,
then it's decided.

35:21.060 --> 35:23.300
Okay?

35:23.300 --> 35:24.840
You want to write 'em down?

35:29.100 --> 35:31.970
We ration food,
share it equally.

35:31.970 --> 35:34.340
Good. Good.
Write that down.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.710
Who else?

35:35.710 --> 35:37.050
Anybody?

35:38.710 --> 35:41.110
No looting from stores,
apart from food.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.520
No stealing from each other.
We have to work as a group.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.720
That's another good one.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.020
Who's got a rule?

35:46.020 --> 35:48.190
Who else?

35:48.190 --> 35:51.290
Whoever endangers the group

35:51.290 --> 35:53.530
is thrown out of the mall.

35:53.530 --> 35:56.030
That would be murder.

35:56.030 --> 35:58.330
No, that would be
self-defense.

36:02.170 --> 36:04.340
What's going on?

36:04.340 --> 36:07.510
They're coming up
with a set of rules.

36:07.510 --> 36:12.080
No way I'm following
what he comes up with.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.880
If you guys are leaving,
I'd like to join you.

36:14.880 --> 36:15.980
Why?

36:18.150 --> 36:20.320
I don't think
this is gonna end well,

36:20.320 --> 36:21.860
not for someone like me.

36:23.090 --> 36:25.860
You can help us pack.

36:25.860 --> 36:27.360
Can we go, too?

36:27.360 --> 36:28.830
Is that okay?

36:29.930 --> 36:32.000
Of course.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.570
Well, wait a minute.

36:33.570 --> 36:36.070
- What's going on?
- We're moving.

36:36.070 --> 36:38.510
Guys, no, we need
to stay together here.

36:38.510 --> 36:39.910
Well, why the hell
do we have rules,

36:39.910 --> 36:41.480
if they don't apply
to everybody?

36:41.480 --> 36:43.910
Come on. Look, this is
for everyone's safety.

36:43.910 --> 36:44.910
Everyone?

36:44.910 --> 36:46.680
Why are you so paranoid?

36:46.680 --> 36:49.020
Alex, tell her
I haven't done anything.

36:49.020 --> 36:50.320
- Don't you dare.
- Calm down.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.790
- Leave her alone!
- Calm down.

36:51.790 --> 36:52.820
Tell her I didn't hurt you.

36:52.820 --> 36:55.520
- I, uh...
- Stay with us.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.750
It's democracy.

36:59.590 --> 37:01.460
I always was an anarchist.

37:07.380 --> 37:11.980
Eve, this is all in an effort
to keep the peace.

37:13.360 --> 37:17.260
Okay. Okay.
Do whatever you want.

37:17.260 --> 37:21.870
Just don't come running for help
when it all falls apart, okay?

37:28.910 --> 37:32.040
Repent,
and let yourself be baptized

37:32.040 --> 37:35.210
in the name of Jesus Christ
for the remission of sins,

37:35.210 --> 37:38.880
and you shall receive
the gift of the Holy Spirit.

37:43.920 --> 37:49.230
Go therefore, and make disciples
of all the nations,

37:49.230 --> 37:53.000
baptizing them
in the name of the Father...

37:57.100 --> 37:58.500
and of the Son...

38:02.140 --> 38:04.540
and of the Holy Spirit.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.820
You okay?

38:12.650 --> 38:14.050
Thank you for this.

38:23.330 --> 38:25.300
Repeat after me.

38:25.300 --> 38:31.900
"I repent and baptize myself
in the name of Jesus Christ

38:31.900 --> 38:34.500
for the remission of sins."

38:34.500 --> 38:40.470
I repent and baptize myself
in the name of Jesus Christ

38:40.480 --> 38:42.310
for the remission of sins.

38:42.310 --> 38:43.380
Again.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.390
- I repent...
- Good. Again.

38:49.050 --> 38:51.050
- I repent...
- Will you be baptized?

38:51.050 --> 38:52.050
Yes.

38:52.060 --> 38:54.360
Will you... be baptized?

38:54.360 --> 38:55.360
Yes, I will.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.090
Why? Why?

38:58.090 --> 39:00.530
Because I repent.

39:00.530 --> 39:01.770
Why?

39:01.770 --> 39:02.770
For my sins.

39:02.770 --> 39:04.840
Let them go, son.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.670
I repent.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.540
I am a sinner.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.440
I'm a sinner.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
I'm a sinner!

39:11.440 --> 39:13.340
- Good.
- I am a sinner.

39:13.340 --> 39:15.740
I am a sinner!

39:15.750 --> 39:17.820
I am a sinner!

39:20.080 --> 39:22.150
Good, Adrian.

39:27.020 --> 39:28.520
I'm happy for you, son.

39:28.530 --> 39:31.570
This is a happy moment.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.570
God loves you.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.870
God loves you.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.080
Thank you.

40:05.460 --> 40:06.760
You guys ready to go?

40:15.510 --> 40:17.210
Listen, there's a chance...

40:17.210 --> 40:19.150
Gray SUV, around the corner
to the left.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.290
Oh!

40:41.060 --> 40:42.860
I just put in fresh batteries.

40:42.870 --> 40:43.870
Thank you.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.070
You okay?

40:45.070 --> 40:46.270
Mm-hmm.

40:46.270 --> 40:47.270
Okay.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.050
