WEBVTT

00:00.234 --> 00:01.122
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>

00:01.123 --> 00:02.903
<i>And here's what's been</i>
<i> going on in my life, lately.</i>

00:02.908 --> 00:04.108
You wouldn't have

00:04.142 --> 00:05.509
downloaded the same version

00:05.543 --> 00:07.611
Morgan had, would you?
Oh...

00:07.646 --> 00:08.963
CHUCK:
<i>I know you lose</i>

00:09.014 --> 00:10.130
<i>memories when you flash.</i>

00:10.181 --> 00:11.515
(beeping)

00:11.549 --> 00:12.349
No!

00:13.435 --> 00:14.485
Whoa, Sarah.

00:14.519 --> 00:15.619
Who are you?

00:15.654 --> 00:16.520
Your handler.

00:16.554 --> 00:17.755
Orders are in.

00:17.789 --> 00:23.727
Kill Chuck Bartowski.

00:23.762 --> 00:24.945
Okay, guys, Sarah's out there.

00:24.980 --> 00:26.797
She's still out there;
we need to find her.

00:26.831 --> 00:28.632
Quinn said that he's after
the last remaining intersect,

00:28.667 --> 00:31.101
which means if we find it,
we will probably find Quinn,

00:31.119 --> 00:32.269
and with him...
Sarah.

00:32.304 --> 00:33.654
Exactly.

00:33.705 --> 00:36.707
Which is why I hacked
into the CIA's database.

00:37.976 --> 00:39.343
Just stay with me
for a little bit,

00:39.377 --> 00:40.344
because I found
something interesting.

00:40.378 --> 00:42.446
These are the blueprints
to DARPA.

00:42.464 --> 00:43.547
DARPA? That's an acronym
for something.

00:43.581 --> 00:44.949
Give me a minute,
I can figure it out.

00:44.983 --> 00:46.850
Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

00:46.885 --> 00:48.052
Morgan,

00:48.086 --> 00:49.887
if the CIA had
a Q working for them,

00:49.921 --> 00:50.971
he'd be working right there.

00:51.006 --> 00:52.323
And I've seen enough
Intersect white rooms

00:52.357 --> 00:54.191
to know that they have one.

00:54.225 --> 00:56.560
Guys, I know
this is a long shot,

00:56.594 --> 00:58.495
But I have to do something
to find her.

00:58.530 --> 00:59.863
I cannot continue

00:59.898 --> 01:01.465
to sit idly
by and wait.

01:01.499 --> 01:03.701
Are you with me?

01:03.735 --> 01:06.370
Let's go.
100%.

01:09.341 --> 01:11.158
Sarah?

01:11.192 --> 01:15.696
I'm... I'm sorry it took me
so long to come home.

01:15.747 --> 01:17.247
Baby...

01:17.282 --> 01:21.085
Baby, what happened to you?

01:21.119 --> 01:25.723
I know you've
forgotten a lot, Sarah,

01:25.757 --> 01:27.591
but you've been undercover
for the past five years,

01:27.625 --> 01:29.226
monitoring a rogue spy.

01:29.260 --> 01:32.229
His name is Chuck Bartowski.

01:32.263 --> 01:34.932
Everything's in here.

01:35.967 --> 01:38.535
Strengths, weaknesses, profiles

01:38.570 --> 01:40.054
of the people closest to him.

01:40.105 --> 01:41.505
Memorize it.

01:41.539 --> 01:43.173
Any questions?

01:43.208 --> 01:46.810
Yeah. Yeah, just one, um...

01:46.845 --> 01:48.946
Why the hell
should I believe you?

01:51.032 --> 01:51.865
(grunting)

01:58.123 --> 01:59.239
I'm on your side,
Agent Walker.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.857
I don't want to
have to hurt you.

02:07.382 --> 02:10.334
And then I threw him
out the window.

02:10.368 --> 02:12.036
And that's how I escaped.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.370
What? I can't
believe that.

02:13.388 --> 02:15.239
That's nuts, amazing.

02:15.273 --> 02:16.273
And Quinn?

02:16.307 --> 02:17.374
He's dead.

02:17.409 --> 02:19.176
And the Intersect
is out of my head.

02:19.210 --> 02:21.278
So, it's all over.
Well, thankfully,

02:21.312 --> 02:22.712
these cuts look
pretty minor.

02:24.482 --> 02:27.151
We should let you get some rest.

02:28.353 --> 02:30.287
QUINN (over comms):
Eleanor Bartowski.

02:30.321 --> 02:31.572
The sister.

02:31.606 --> 02:33.657
Goes by Ellie.

02:33.691 --> 02:34.892
Thank you, Ellie.

02:34.926 --> 02:36.293
And you remember
her husband's name.

02:36.327 --> 02:38.912
And thank you, Devon.

02:40.331 --> 02:41.832
Thank you, all of you.

02:41.866 --> 02:43.333
I'm-I'm really glad to be home.

02:43.368 --> 02:44.618
Glad you're safe.

02:44.669 --> 02:46.670
Me, too.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.790
(grunting)

02:52.927 --> 02:54.744
I don't remember you

02:54.763 --> 02:56.797
any more than I remember
this Bartowski guy.

02:56.848 --> 02:59.883
So you tell me,
what happened to me?

02:59.917 --> 03:02.519
(choking):
Walker, give me a chance.

03:02.554 --> 03:04.421
There's something
you need to see.

03:04.439 --> 03:05.606
(beep)

03:05.640 --> 03:08.358
This is Agent Sarah Walker.

03:08.393 --> 03:11.695
Today is September 24, 2007,
Day One.

03:11.729 --> 03:13.931
Today, I made contact
with the Intersect,

03:13.965 --> 03:17.101
Charles Irving Bartowski,
or rather, Chuck.

03:17.135 --> 03:20.170
My mission is simple: find out
what he knows, gain his trust

03:20.205 --> 03:22.172
and monitor his actions
until the agency

03:22.207 --> 03:24.441
can decide what to do with him.

03:24.459 --> 03:26.477
(beep)
Well, the Agency

03:26.511 --> 03:28.278
has made a decision,
Agent Walker.

03:28.313 --> 03:29.546
(hammer clicks)

03:29.581 --> 03:33.016
Chuck Bartowski has proven to be
a major threat to...

03:33.051 --> 03:36.053
(clears throat)
national security.

03:37.839 --> 03:39.656
Well, then put Director Graham
on the phone.

03:39.691 --> 03:41.175
He gives me my orders.

03:41.226 --> 03:42.392
He's dead, Sarah.

03:42.427 --> 03:44.561
Well, what about
my partner, Bryce?

03:44.596 --> 03:45.646
Where is he?

03:45.680 --> 03:47.631
I'm sorry, Sarah.

03:47.665 --> 03:49.199
He's dead, too.

03:49.234 --> 03:52.069
That's not possible.

03:58.159 --> 03:59.976
We believe that
Bartowski and his team

03:59.994 --> 04:02.379
are responsible
for both of their deaths.

04:04.282 --> 04:06.583
And I wish I could just

04:06.618 --> 04:08.886
let you forget
everything horrible

04:08.920 --> 04:10.854
that this man has done,

04:10.889 --> 04:14.525
but Chuck Bartowski
needs to be stopped.

04:14.559 --> 04:16.510
He's a traitor.

04:18.163 --> 04:20.164
And you want me to kill him?

04:20.197 --> 04:21.398
Yes.

04:21.432 --> 04:23.000
But first,

04:23.034 --> 04:26.019
I need you to retrieve something
that he's stolen from us.

04:26.054 --> 04:28.021
A pair of Intersect glasses.

04:28.056 --> 04:30.858
We believe that Chuck
wants to use them

04:30.892 --> 04:33.210
to upload a pristine
version of the Intersect.

04:35.613 --> 04:37.013
Sarah?

04:37.031 --> 04:39.516
If you want your life back--

04:39.551 --> 04:41.752
the life he stole from you--

04:41.786 --> 04:45.455
return to Burbank,
retrieve the glasses,

04:45.490 --> 04:48.659
and put Chuck Bartowski to rest

04:48.693 --> 04:50.694
once and for all.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:00.672 --> 05:02.539
I'm so glad you're okay.

05:02.574 --> 05:03.740
I love you.

05:03.775 --> 05:05.776
I love you, too.

town on that thing, huh?

06:11.869 --> 06:14.071
(door closes)
I'm alone.

06:14.105 --> 06:14.972
Good.

06:15.006 --> 06:16.106
Find the glasses.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.425
(over comms):
Look for a hidden safe or vault.

06:18.476 --> 06:20.077
Be careful, Walker.

06:20.111 --> 06:22.879
Do not underestimate him.

06:22.897 --> 06:24.815
He has proven time and again

06:24.849 --> 06:26.566
that he is more dangerous
than he looks,

06:26.601 --> 06:29.453
and remember, the rest of his
team is only a few feet away.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.228
MORGAN (over phone):
<i>Different how?</i>

06:38.246 --> 06:40.364
I don't know, Morgan; that's
what I'm trying to tell you.

06:40.398 --> 06:41.748
I can't put my finger on it.

06:41.783 --> 06:43.934
Sarah just seems different.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.669
Look, of course she's
not acting like herself.

06:45.703 --> 06:47.838
Okay, she was kidnapped
by some homicidal maniac

06:47.872 --> 06:49.239
on a Japanese bullet train,

06:49.274 --> 06:51.608
and then in order to escape,
she had to kill the dude

06:51.643 --> 06:52.976
and walk home
from his secret base

06:53.011 --> 06:54.444
barefoot!

06:54.479 --> 06:55.946
Wow, she really
is incredible, huh?

06:55.980 --> 06:58.298
Yeah, yeah, maybe you're right,
maybe you're right.

06:58.349 --> 07:00.384
Maybe I just need to try
and make her feel,

07:00.418 --> 07:01.601
you know, a little more relaxed.

07:01.636 --> 07:03.220
Yes, yes,
untense the tense girl.

07:03.254 --> 07:04.354
Loosen up

07:04.389 --> 07:05.588
that leggy blonde.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.624
I can do that.

07:09.894 --> 07:12.162
Hey, uh...
that leggy blonde.

07:12.196 --> 07:13.981
Hey, honey, uh,

07:14.032 --> 07:15.365
you want to meet me
in the bedroom?

07:15.400 --> 07:17.134
I have a surprise for you.
Okay.

07:17.168 --> 07:19.036
Okay.

07:20.204 --> 07:22.272
I think he's up to something.

07:22.290 --> 07:24.541
QUINN (over comms):
Stay alert.

07:24.575 --> 07:27.794
It could be a trap.

07:27.829 --> 07:28.945
(door squeaks open)

07:28.980 --> 07:32.449
Welcome to the Bartowski

07:32.483 --> 07:33.783
Inn and Spa Resort

07:33.801 --> 07:35.986
where all of your worries
melt away.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.988
You have to use
a little imagination,

07:38.022 --> 07:40.324
but picture, if you will,
outside those windows

07:40.358 --> 07:43.627
the gorgeous Ojai Valley.

07:43.661 --> 07:46.797
And what may look like
a normal, five-year-old mattress

07:46.831 --> 07:50.901
is, in actuality, a
luxurious massage table.

07:50.935 --> 07:53.353
Huh? Huh?
♪ Ha, ha, ha.

07:53.404 --> 07:55.572
A sheet has been provided
for your discretion.

07:55.606 --> 07:57.190
Oh.
(clears throat)

07:57.241 --> 07:59.242
Great.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.169
QUINN:
Walker, what's going on?

08:09.203 --> 08:10.670
He claims he wants
to give me a massage,

08:10.705 --> 08:12.255
but I think he's onto me.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.557
You almost ready?

08:13.591 --> 08:15.459
Just a second!

08:15.493 --> 08:16.727
Calm down.

08:16.761 --> 08:19.062
You should use this
as an opportunity.

08:19.097 --> 08:21.698
Allow yourself
to be vulnerable with him.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.666
It'll convince him
that there's nothing wrong.

08:23.684 --> 08:25.769
Okay.

08:36.397 --> 08:39.349
Okay, I'm ready.

08:39.384 --> 08:41.952
(clears throat)

08:41.986 --> 08:44.454
All right.

08:44.489 --> 08:46.089
Here we go.

08:46.091 --> 08:49.092
(kissing sound)
Starting

08:49.127 --> 08:51.027
with the application of the oil.

08:51.062 --> 08:52.195
(whistles)

08:52.213 --> 08:54.097
Ah, yes.

08:54.132 --> 08:57.267
Relax, relax.

08:57.301 --> 08:59.202
This would actually go
a heck of a lot smoother

08:59.237 --> 09:01.104
if you just brought these
down to your side, honey.

09:01.139 --> 09:02.706
So, just down to your side.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.876
Rela...
There we go. There we go.

09:05.910 --> 09:10.881
See? Yes, better already.
Breathe. Yeah...

09:10.915 --> 09:13.083
Baby, your muscles are so tight,
they're hurting my hands.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.584
A lot of lactic
acid buildup, huh?

09:14.619 --> 09:16.810
Why don't, why don't
I crack your neck?

09:16.835 --> 09:17.788
No!

09:17.789 --> 09:19.156
What? What did I,
what did I do?

09:19.190 --> 09:21.291
What did I say? You love it
when I crack your neck.

09:21.325 --> 09:24.561
QUINN: Don't blow your cover, Walker.
Talk to him!

09:24.595 --> 09:27.130
Uh, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, Chuck.

09:27.165 --> 09:28.632
I really appreciate
everything

09:28.666 --> 09:31.067
that you are trying to do.

09:31.102 --> 09:34.638
It's just that it's been
a long couple days, and, um,

09:34.672 --> 09:37.007
you know, maybe it's just best
if we go to bed.

09:37.041 --> 09:41.928
Yeah. Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

09:41.963 --> 09:44.281
Whatever you need.

09:44.315 --> 09:47.417
Wow! It's all ending, huh?

09:47.452 --> 09:48.969
What are you babbling about?

09:49.020 --> 09:51.988
I just get nostalgic, you know?

09:52.023 --> 09:54.157
Quinn's dead,
Sarah's home safe,

09:54.192 --> 09:55.859
so we're done, man.
No more missions.

09:55.893 --> 09:56.927
And no more gunplay.

09:56.961 --> 09:58.328
Think about it, Casey.
Five years.

09:58.362 --> 10:02.833
I went from pipsqueaky
sidekick to this.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.985
And you, you were
the most cold-blooded

10:05.036 --> 10:06.670
sniper in the whole world,

10:06.704 --> 10:08.205
and now you're scrubbing
our floors.

10:08.239 --> 10:10.574
Well, if you would use a plate
when you're eating taquitos,

10:10.608 --> 10:12.659
I wouldn't have
to scrub the floors, would I?

10:15.963 --> 10:18.148
Do you really think
I've changed?

10:18.182 --> 10:20.967
I'm so glad
that Sarah's back.

10:21.002 --> 10:22.352
Bill.

10:22.386 --> 10:24.171
Social event. Me, too.
I don't know

10:24.222 --> 10:25.689
what Chuck would do
without her.

10:25.723 --> 10:27.790
For you.
For you.

10:30.928 --> 10:33.196
Babe...
Babe, I just got

10:33.231 --> 10:34.164
a letter from...

10:34.198 --> 10:35.499
Carlos Shuman Medical Center?

10:35.533 --> 10:38.168
In Chicago offering me
a research position.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.303
They want me to head up
the cardiac division.

10:40.338 --> 10:42.606
They must know we're a couple.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.076
Babe, I think we're being wooed
by Midwesterners.

10:46.110 --> 10:50.580
I know, I know.
We could, we could buy a house.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.582
We could buy a big house.

10:52.617 --> 10:53.917
Okay.

10:53.951 --> 10:55.818
Are we... are we really
considering this?

10:55.836 --> 10:58.922
We've lived our whole lives
in California.

10:58.956 --> 11:01.424
We've always said
a change would be nice.

11:01.459 --> 11:04.027
I just always assumed
I would live close to Chuck.

11:04.061 --> 11:06.196
Yeah, yeah.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.831
But Sarah's back now.

11:07.865 --> 11:09.566
He's okay, right?

11:32.323 --> 11:35.325
Quinn, I found the glasses.

11:35.359 --> 11:36.710
QUINN:
Good. Then,

11:36.744 --> 11:39.396
it is time
to finish your mission.

11:39.430 --> 11:42.699
Take out Bartowski.

11:50.074 --> 11:51.925
Sarah?

11:53.144 --> 11:55.145
(sighs)

12:00.234 --> 12:02.218
(sighs contentedly)

12:13.965 --> 12:16.166
(whispers):
Chuck just left.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.617
I'm following.

12:30.548 --> 12:33.116
Hey.

12:33.150 --> 12:34.784
Hi.
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

12:34.819 --> 12:36.886
No. I couldn't sleep.

12:36.921 --> 12:38.121
How's Sarah?

12:38.155 --> 12:40.790
Um...

12:40.825 --> 12:43.393
You'd better come inside.

12:43.427 --> 12:45.428
Thanks.

12:57.608 --> 12:59.609
CHUCK:
<i>I don't know. I guess,</i>

12:59.627 --> 13:04.814
it's, uh, the little things
that are different.

13:04.849 --> 13:06.833
Like, her feet
get cold at night,

13:06.884 --> 13:08.718
so I always put mine

13:08.753 --> 13:11.187
on top of hers
to keep them warm.

13:11.222 --> 13:14.290
And I know it sounds stupid,
but tonight she...

13:14.325 --> 13:16.426
pulled her feet away
from mine,

13:16.460 --> 13:18.361
and she never pulled them away
like that.

13:18.396 --> 13:19.796
QUINN:
Walker, where are you?

13:19.830 --> 13:21.331
(whispers):
Ellie's apartment.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.666
They're talking.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.668
Chuck,
it's her first night back.

13:24.702 --> 13:26.870
I can't imagine
what Sarah's been through.

13:26.904 --> 13:28.371
She's involved in this, too.

13:28.406 --> 13:30.373
What are they talking about?

13:30.408 --> 13:32.242
About me.

13:32.276 --> 13:35.478
I almost lost my best friend.

13:35.496 --> 13:36.980
And now, my wife,

13:37.014 --> 13:40.917
and always for the same reason,
which is the Intersect, Ellie.

13:40.951 --> 13:44.120
Which is why I keep thinking
that I need to destroy it

13:44.155 --> 13:45.355
for good this time.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.457
What do you mean?

13:49.627 --> 13:51.428
Quinn is dead, yes,

13:51.462 --> 13:53.363
but there will always be someone
who wants it,

13:53.397 --> 13:55.298
and we will never be able
to move on

13:55.332 --> 13:56.866
with our lives until it is gone.

13:56.901 --> 13:58.535
Quinn, are you hearing this?

13:58.569 --> 14:01.071
He doesn't want to download
the Intersect onto the glasses.

14:01.105 --> 14:02.605
He wants to destroy it
completely.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.642
I know where the latest version
of the Intersect is being kept.

14:05.676 --> 14:08.111
All I need to do is sneak in
and plant the virus.

14:08.145 --> 14:10.213
What do you want me to do?

14:10.247 --> 14:12.015
You have to go with Chuck

14:12.049 --> 14:14.350
and download it
onto the glasses yourself

14:14.385 --> 14:15.752
to ensure its protection.

14:15.786 --> 14:17.787
It's up to you to keep it safe.

14:18.789 --> 14:20.757
Then you can kill him.

14:23.094 --> 14:25.695
Just wanted to get a little...

14:25.730 --> 14:27.764
sisterly advice.

14:27.798 --> 14:29.799
(sighs)

14:32.803 --> 14:35.739
I think if you can be safe,
then you should do it.

14:35.773 --> 14:37.774
It's what Dad always wanted.

14:39.643 --> 14:41.611
Thanks.

14:41.645 --> 14:43.396
Good luck.

14:43.431 --> 14:44.647
Get some sleep.

14:44.682 --> 14:46.683
Oh, no.

15:01.415 --> 15:03.133
Chuck?

15:03.167 --> 15:04.968
Yeah?

15:05.002 --> 15:07.637
I'm cold.

15:07.671 --> 15:08.972
Yeah?

15:09.006 --> 15:11.574
Hey, hey.

15:15.546 --> 15:17.547
(sighs)

15:21.032 --> 15:23.632
So that's how I figure we'll
infiltrate DARPA headquarters.

15:23.636 --> 15:25.604
Once we're in the white room,
I'll boot up their system.

15:25.638 --> 15:28.040
Sarah, you'll plant the virus
using this,

15:29.095 --> 15:31.289
and we'll destroy the Intersect,
once and for all.

15:32.323 --> 15:33.523
That seems a little drastic..

15:33.591 --> 15:34.891
Yeah, well,
it is drastic, Casey,

15:34.926 --> 15:36.893
but think of all the Intersect
is responsible for.

15:36.928 --> 15:38.228
My father's
death, Volkoff's

15:38.262 --> 15:39.646
very existence, Morgan's

15:39.680 --> 15:41.331
brain melting,

15:41.365 --> 15:42.566
Sarah...

15:44.035 --> 15:46.570
Let's just say,
it's been more bad than good.

15:46.604 --> 15:48.471
When my dad found
out I had it,

15:48.506 --> 15:51.241
he told me to destroy it,
and I wish I had.

15:51.275 --> 15:52.976
We'd all be better off.

15:53.010 --> 15:55.979
I'm not gonna miss
that opportunity again.

15:56.013 --> 15:59.316
If this is what you want, Chuck,
I'm in.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.186
All right, I'm in.

16:03.221 --> 16:04.421
I'm on board, obviously.

16:04.455 --> 16:06.089
I also want to say
that I'm really glad

16:06.123 --> 16:07.457
that we're having
this third last mission,

16:07.491 --> 16:09.542
seeing as how I wasn't a part
of the other two, uh...

16:09.594 --> 16:11.228
All right, we
leave in 20.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.766
Hey, buddy, real quick-- you
have any extra tranq darts?

16:16.801 --> 16:19.002
I used all mine up
at tranq dart... practice.

16:19.036 --> 16:21.388
Yeah. Uh, actually,

16:21.439 --> 16:25.242
Sarah normally keeps an extra
clip for me in her bag, so...

16:25.276 --> 16:28.178
No dice, buddy.

16:28.212 --> 16:29.246
She must have forgotten.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.747
Oh, yeah. Don't
worry about it.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.049
Hey, Casey, Chuck says you got
to let me use your tranq darts.

16:33.084 --> 16:36.519
What is she doing with these?

16:43.227 --> 16:45.262
(whirring and chirping)

16:45.296 --> 16:46.763
(gunfire)

16:46.797 --> 16:48.465
(beeping)

16:48.499 --> 16:49.633
(whirring)

16:49.667 --> 16:51.968
(beeping, whirring
and chirping)

16:52.003 --> 16:53.637
(air hissing)

16:53.671 --> 16:54.971
(researcher sniffing)

16:55.006 --> 16:56.806
What the...?

16:57.842 --> 16:59.809
(beeps)

16:59.844 --> 17:01.394
(drill whirring)

17:03.247 --> 17:05.147
(sighs)

17:11.105 --> 17:12.888
(whirring)

17:12.906 --> 17:15.391
Three, two,

17:15.409 --> 17:17.410
one.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.063
(sighs, inhales through nose)

17:20.097 --> 17:21.948
I think we're okay.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.833
Let's find
the Intersect crew.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.401
We won't have long
before they wake up.

17:25.453 --> 17:28.305
Look at this place.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.090
It's incredible! Wow!

17:30.124 --> 17:31.407
What's under here?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.009
It's like a big silver ghost.

17:33.044 --> 17:34.277
(laughs)

17:34.312 --> 17:36.129
It's creepy.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.747
(whooshing)

17:37.782 --> 17:40.850
A cloak of invisibility!

17:40.885 --> 17:42.919
Yes!

17:42.953 --> 17:45.322
You're a wizard, Harry.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.760
Grimes, Grimes,
what, are you on a diet?

17:50.795 --> 17:52.262
What are, what are you
talking about?

17:52.296 --> 17:54.364
Well, 'cause you started to
disappear in front of my eyes.

17:54.398 --> 17:56.466
Get it? Get it? Oh.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.286
Hey, the Intersect room is
down this hall. Let's go.

18:00.321 --> 18:01.671
What? What? Sorry,
I couldn't hear you.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.039
I'm the headless Grimesman.

18:03.074 --> 18:04.273
(laughing):
Headless Grimesman.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.342
You...

18:05.376 --> 18:06.793
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

18:06.827 --> 18:07.979
It was the one-armed man.
You find this man.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.744
Go.
You never saw <i>The Fugitive?</i>

18:24.061 --> 18:25.595
Five guards.

18:25.629 --> 18:28.398
All right, Team,
what's the plan?

18:28.432 --> 18:30.650
Let's use some sort
of distraction. I think if, uh,

18:30.684 --> 18:32.836
you threw like
a rock.

18:32.870 --> 18:33.937
Sarah?

18:40.144 --> 18:41.494
(grunts)

18:42.696 --> 18:44.080
(groans)
(grunts)

18:48.986 --> 18:50.220
(grunts)

18:52.456 --> 18:54.174
(grunts)
Hey! Oh!

18:54.208 --> 18:56.209
(men thudding to floor)

19:00.097 --> 19:01.381
Let's go.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.999
(whistles)
Wow.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.435
Quite a woman you got in
your hands, huh, buddy?

19:05.469 --> 19:07.470
Yeah.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.441
(electronic chirping)

19:13.861 --> 19:17.247
(keypad beeping)

19:17.281 --> 19:19.315
(clacking, whooshing)

19:21.118 --> 19:22.402
(door opens)

19:22.453 --> 19:24.704
CHUCK: All right, just give me
a few minutes

19:24.738 --> 19:26.573
to get the system up
and running.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.533
All right, got it.

19:36.567 --> 19:37.834
Sarah, you're on.

19:37.868 --> 19:39.836
(chirps)

19:39.870 --> 19:41.537
CHUCK: I'm not sure for
how long, though,

19:41.555 --> 19:43.006
so upload the virus now.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.041
Uploading.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.486
It should have gone through
by now.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.654
Is there something wrong?

19:57.688 --> 19:59.155
Just a second.

20:01.692 --> 20:03.193
(beeps)

20:09.567 --> 20:10.667
CASEY:
Walker!

20:10.701 --> 20:12.085
Drop the gun.

20:12.119 --> 20:14.337
Sarah? Sarah,
what are you doing?

20:14.371 --> 20:15.672
Drop the gun.

20:24.131 --> 20:26.850
Now, I have the Intersect,
and you can't destroy it,

20:26.884 --> 20:28.968
and you can't hurt
anybody else with it.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.354
Baby,
what are you talking about?

20:31.388 --> 20:32.522
Quinn told me the truth.

20:32.556 --> 20:33.973
Quinn's not dead?

20:35.392 --> 20:37.694
I know about you.

20:37.728 --> 20:39.896
I know what you've done,
all of you.

20:39.930 --> 20:41.364
I know everything.

20:41.398 --> 20:43.432
I don't know
what's happening right now,

20:43.450 --> 20:46.619
but whatever he told you
is a lie.

20:48.005 --> 20:49.272
The Intersect is-is...

20:49.290 --> 20:50.740
It's damaged your memory
or something,

20:50.774 --> 20:52.158
because the Sarah that I know

20:52.209 --> 20:55.178
would never do
something like this.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.180
Baby, please.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.548
It's me.

20:58.582 --> 21:00.583
It's your Chuck.

21:06.790 --> 21:09.192
QUINN (over comms):
Get the hell out of there, Walker!

21:09.977 --> 21:10.810
(groans)

21:14.398 --> 21:17.317
Don't!

21:21.605 --> 21:23.439
(whooshing)

21:23.474 --> 21:25.008
(door clanks shut)

21:25.042 --> 21:26.826
(gunshot, electrical crackling)

21:28.028 --> 21:31.331
(rhythmic beeping)

21:31.365 --> 21:32.815
This can't be happening.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.317
It doesn't make any sense.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.754
(beeping quickens)

21:37.788 --> 21:40.039
(rapid beeping)

21:40.090 --> 21:41.891
She attached an explosive
to the door.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.993
She could detonate it
at any second.

21:44.028 --> 21:45.562
No. No, she wouldn't.

21:45.596 --> 21:46.930
We gotta take cover.

21:46.964 --> 21:48.331
She wouldn't.

21:58.058 --> 22:00.343
Quinn, maybe we don't have
to do this.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.377
They're locked inside.

22:01.412 --> 22:02.946
They'll be arrested.

22:02.980 --> 22:04.897
That's not your call.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.367
(explosion inside building)

22:22.731 --> 22:24.899
(coughs) We gotta get out of here
before more guards come.

22:25.047 --> 22:26.213
What just happened?

22:26.248 --> 22:27.214
Sarah, sh-she just...

22:27.249 --> 22:28.716
Quinn must've
turned her

22:28.750 --> 22:30.618
into thinking that
she works for him.

22:30.652 --> 22:33.120
Now she has exactly what
he's been looking for:

22:33.155 --> 22:34.789
the last version
of the Intersect.

22:34.823 --> 22:36.857
No, she doesn't.

22:36.892 --> 22:38.292
I switched them out.

22:38.327 --> 22:40.094
What the hell?
How'd you do that?

22:40.128 --> 22:41.879
I saw the glasses in her bag
before we left.

22:41.913 --> 22:43.230
I didn't want to say anything

22:43.265 --> 22:45.599
because I didn't want
to believe it.

22:45.634 --> 22:48.469
But deep down,
I knew it was true.

22:48.503 --> 22:51.222
My wife never came home.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.592
(tires screech)

23:03.485 --> 23:05.586
That was a government facility
you just blew up.

23:05.620 --> 23:08.489
And that was a man
who deserved to die.

23:09.992 --> 23:11.759
Did you get the glasses?

23:17.666 --> 23:20.034
These are empty.

23:20.068 --> 23:21.402
They're fake!

23:21.436 --> 23:24.005
That's not possible.
I had them on me the whole time.

23:24.039 --> 23:25.339
No one got close to you?

23:25.374 --> 23:27.308
Chuck. Chuck did, I guess.

23:27.342 --> 23:30.311
As I was leaving,
he tried to grab me...

23:30.345 --> 23:34.131
and, and convince me that
our relationship was real.

23:34.182 --> 23:35.983
I guess he must've
switched them out then.

23:36.018 --> 23:39.520
This is exactly what
I warned you about,

23:39.554 --> 23:40.755
Agent Walker.

23:40.789 --> 23:43.024
That's why I pushed
the detonator button.

23:43.058 --> 23:46.527
This man is a liar;
he is a manipulator.

23:46.561 --> 23:48.863
(cell phone rings)

23:52.334 --> 23:53.767
He's still alive?

23:53.785 --> 23:55.669
I made a mistake.

23:55.704 --> 23:58.205
And I can promise you I will not
make the same mistake again.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.458
I will get those glasses back
no matter what it takes.

24:00.492 --> 24:02.109
She's not picking up.

24:02.127 --> 24:04.328
Of course she's not
picking up, dude! She's evil!

24:04.379 --> 24:05.612
Okay, that's
a little unfair.

24:05.630 --> 24:06.881
It's the faulty
Intersect talking.

24:06.915 --> 24:08.382
It's kind of like what happened
with me, only much, much worse.

24:08.417 --> 24:10.951
Seeing as how she
tried to kill us.

24:10.969 --> 24:13.504
Quinn turned her.
We have to consider the fact

24:13.555 --> 24:14.722
that maybe she's gone.

24:14.756 --> 24:16.557
Hoe can you say that?
She's your friend!

24:16.591 --> 24:17.842
And she's not gone.
Not completely anyway.

24:17.893 --> 24:19.427
Oh, yeah? Did his memory
come magically back

24:19.461 --> 24:20.811
after the Intersect?
You know it didn't.

24:20.846 --> 24:22.813
All I have to do is remind
her of who she really is.

24:22.848 --> 24:24.965
You know, look, look, I have,
I have the glasses.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.635
Even if she doesn't remember me,
I know that she wanted these.

24:27.669 --> 24:29.336
She tried to kill us, Chuck.

24:29.371 --> 24:31.489
Can't pretend that everything
is as it was.

24:31.523 --> 24:33.007
Otherwise, she's gonna
succeed next time.

24:33.041 --> 24:35.042
And I'm not gonna
lose you both.

24:35.077 --> 24:37.978
You honestly think that?

24:38.013 --> 24:40.147
She's a trained assassin.
She knows where we live,

24:40.182 --> 24:41.382
she knows where
our families live.

24:41.416 --> 24:43.784
He's right, Chuck.
He's right, okay?

24:43.818 --> 24:46.387
What about Ellie
and Awesome?

24:46.421 --> 24:53.627
She wouldn't.

24:53.662 --> 24:56.397
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

24:56.431 --> 24:58.432
(ringing)

25:00.135 --> 25:01.602
Hey, bro, I'm sorry.

25:01.636 --> 25:04.672
I was just trying to get Clara
down for a nap. What's up?

25:04.706 --> 25:06.540
Are you okay?
Is everyone all right?

25:06.575 --> 25:07.708
Yeah, of course.

25:07.742 --> 25:09.727
(sighs) Thank God.

25:10.879 --> 25:12.696
Everyone's at the apartment?

25:12.731 --> 25:14.648
Well, no.
Ellie just went to grab

25:14.683 --> 25:16.784
a cup of coffee with Sarah.
Why?

25:18.954 --> 25:21.388
I'm glad we're doing this.

25:21.423 --> 25:23.257
You've been through so much
lately.

25:23.291 --> 25:24.492
How are you holding up?

25:24.526 --> 25:25.759
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

25:25.794 --> 25:28.295
We're all really worried
about you.

25:28.330 --> 25:29.914
Chuck's was a wreck.

25:29.965 --> 25:31.098
I can imagine.

25:31.133 --> 25:32.583
(phone rings)

25:32.634 --> 25:34.235
Oh.

25:34.269 --> 25:35.369
Mm, speak of the devil.

25:35.387 --> 25:37.471
Do you mind? I actually
have to talk to him.

25:37.506 --> 25:40.074
SARAH (over speaker):
Hey, sweetie.

25:41.810 --> 25:45.579
So, I see you that you switched
out the Intersect glasses.

25:45.614 --> 25:46.880
That was a nice move.

25:46.898 --> 25:48.549
Should've known
I couldn't trust you.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.152
I have some moves of my own.

25:51.186 --> 25:53.521
We're at the Bergamot Café
off Gower.

25:53.555 --> 25:55.189
Bring the glasses; come alone.

25:55.223 --> 25:56.607
You have 15 minutes.

25:56.658 --> 25:59.026
This is crazy, Sarah. Please.

25:59.060 --> 26:00.761
Oh, Bartowski,

26:00.795 --> 26:02.163
if you try anything...

26:04.449 --> 26:05.799
Sarah, what are you doing?

26:05.834 --> 26:08.836
I'm gonna put a bullet
between your sister's eyes.

26:11.339 --> 26:12.640
Oh, my God.

26:12.674 --> 26:14.942
BECKMAN: I've heard enough.
You were right to contact me.

26:14.976 --> 26:16.544
Go to that café.

26:16.578 --> 26:18.145
But convince Sarah
that you've hidden

26:18.180 --> 26:19.813
the Intersect glasses
somewhere else.

26:19.848 --> 26:22.299
I'm moving men into place
at Regal Plaza.

26:22.350 --> 26:24.118
Get Sarah there.

26:24.152 --> 26:26.520
And then what?
Have a sniper take her out?

26:26.555 --> 26:30.324
We will do whatever it takes to
ensure the safety of your sister

26:30.358 --> 26:31.692
while bringing in Agent Walker
peacefully.

26:31.726 --> 26:35.496
But, Chuck, you know that
what happens in that plaza

26:35.530 --> 26:37.765
depends entirely on Sarah.

26:40.535 --> 26:44.605
Sarah, I think that the
Intersect may have damaged...

26:44.639 --> 26:46.657
Stop talking.
I know you're involved.

26:52.664 --> 26:53.881
CHUCK: You okay?

26:53.915 --> 26:55.482
You got the glasses?

26:55.517 --> 26:57.451
I don't have them with me.

26:58.637 --> 26:59.970
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!

27:00.005 --> 27:02.022
Just wait a
second, okay?

27:02.057 --> 27:04.158
Whatever you think I've done,

27:04.192 --> 27:05.793
she didn't do anything.
She's innocent.

27:05.827 --> 27:08.829
So I will lead you
to the glasses,

27:08.863 --> 27:11.832
but just you and me, okay?

27:11.866 --> 27:13.834
Please, just let her go.

27:13.868 --> 27:15.803
I'll follow you
in a separate car.

27:15.837 --> 27:16.803
She'll come with me.

27:16.821 --> 27:19.690
If I see anything
suspicious, I...

27:19.741 --> 27:23.143
Well, you'd better hope I don't.

27:24.212 --> 27:26.046
Okay, okay. Follow me.

27:26.081 --> 27:27.865
You drive.

27:35.957 --> 27:38.726
CASEY: All right, Bartowski,
we have eyes on the plaza.

27:43.848 --> 27:48.001
Okay, she's following me,
but, Casey,

27:48.019 --> 27:50.704
she brought Ellie with her.

27:52.073 --> 27:54.108
Don't worry, Chuck.
I'll make sure

27:54.142 --> 27:56.877
Ellie comes out of this
without a scratch.

28:01.950 --> 28:05.286
Sarah... you don't
have to do this.

28:06.955 --> 28:10.924
Casey, what if she resists?

28:10.959 --> 28:13.027
Hey, this isn't
the Sarah you know.

28:13.061 --> 28:15.796
You were in my wedding.
You were at the hospital

28:15.830 --> 28:17.214
when my baby was born.
We're family.

28:17.248 --> 28:20.084
No, we're not. This was
always a mission for me,

28:20.135 --> 28:21.535
and today I'm gonna finish it.

28:25.256 --> 28:27.091
Chuck, you listen to me.

28:27.142 --> 28:30.678
She's not in there anymore.

28:30.712 --> 28:31.812
Sarah's gone.

28:33.565 --> 28:35.182
No, she's not.

28:35.216 --> 28:37.651
My wife is not gone.

28:37.686 --> 28:39.920
Bartowski? Chuck!

28:39.954 --> 28:41.888
<i>Where are you going?!</i>

28:49.731 --> 28:52.950
So once you get the glasses,
what then, hmm?

28:53.001 --> 28:54.118
What happens to Chuck?

28:54.169 --> 28:56.804
Just stay close.

28:58.840 --> 29:02.092
Okay, he's right up
there ahead.

29:08.433 --> 29:09.416
If you could remember,

29:09.434 --> 29:11.468
if you were still you,

29:11.519 --> 29:14.555
you would want me to do anything
I could to save Chuck.

29:14.589 --> 29:15.689
You would want this.

29:15.724 --> 29:16.757
Want what?

29:16.775 --> 29:17.691
Sorry, Sarah.

29:17.726 --> 29:18.809
(engine revs)

29:18.860 --> 29:20.361
SARAH: <i>Ellie, no!</i>

29:21.229 --> 29:23.530
(horn blaring)

29:29.435 --> 29:30.635
Ellie.

29:33.310 --> 29:34.877
Oh, God, are you okay?
I'm okay.

29:34.895 --> 29:35.929
What were you thinking?

29:35.980 --> 29:37.981
I was thinking
about protecting you.

29:38.015 --> 29:40.099
Chuck, Sarah's trying
to kill you.

29:40.150 --> 29:42.652
There's something seriously
wrong with her, Chuck.

29:42.686 --> 29:44.654
That's why I'm taking her
somewhere

29:44.688 --> 29:46.155
that'll help her remember.

29:47.391 --> 29:48.441
(grunts)

29:48.492 --> 29:49.943
QUINN:
Agent Walker, what's happening?

29:49.994 --> 29:53.229
Walker, where are you?

29:53.264 --> 29:55.048
What if she
doesn't remember?

29:55.082 --> 29:57.033
She's further gone
than Morgan ever was, Chuck.

29:57.067 --> 29:59.335
You need to call the CIA.

29:59.370 --> 30:00.837
You need
to turn her in.

30:00.871 --> 30:02.605
Listen, everyone keeps telling
me that Sarah's gone,

30:02.640 --> 30:03.940
but she's not. She's right here.

30:03.974 --> 30:05.241
Chuck...

30:05.276 --> 30:07.126
What if it was Devon?

30:18.689 --> 30:21.157
Hey, where are you?
Are you okay?

30:21.191 --> 30:22.609
I'm fine, I'm fine,
but Chuck isn't.

30:22.643 --> 30:24.427
He just, he just took off
with Sarah.

30:24.445 --> 30:27.263
Damn it, Bartowski.

30:27.298 --> 30:28.531
John, I know my little brother,

30:28.566 --> 30:30.500
and I know where
he would take her.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.044
Hi.

30:41.078 --> 30:43.112
Look, I know you
don't remember me.

30:43.147 --> 30:45.148
I thought maybe
you'd remember this,

30:45.182 --> 30:46.883
our dream home...

30:46.917 --> 30:50.553
the one you always told me
that you wanted.

30:50.588 --> 30:54.557
Our relationship was
a cover, Bartowski.

30:54.592 --> 30:56.759
Always has been.

30:56.794 --> 30:58.528
You're just an assignment.

30:58.562 --> 31:01.531
No, I <i>was</i> an assignment,

31:01.565 --> 31:03.633
and then you fell in love
with me.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.301
And I know that
sounds crazy,

31:05.336 --> 31:07.136
and if I didn't
know any better,

31:07.171 --> 31:09.105
I-I'd say it's crazy, too.

31:09.139 --> 31:11.507
But the fact remains, you fell
for me, Sarah, you did.

31:11.542 --> 31:14.243
My job is too make you think
that I feel something.

31:14.278 --> 31:17.046
That's what I do best; I lie.

31:17.081 --> 31:19.482
Actually, you're
not as good a liar

31:19.516 --> 31:21.284
as you think you are.

31:21.318 --> 31:22.552
It's true,

31:22.586 --> 31:25.121
okay?

31:25.155 --> 31:26.889
Our first kiss,

31:26.924 --> 31:30.226
not our, not our
first cover kiss,

31:30.260 --> 31:32.679
but our first,
our first real kiss...

31:32.713 --> 31:34.964
<i>was when we were trying</i>
<i>to defuse a bomb</i>

31:34.999 --> 31:36.832
<i>and we we thought</i>
<i>we were gonna die,</i>

31:36.850 --> 31:40.836
<i>and I closed my eyes and...</i>

31:40.854 --> 31:43.439
I felt you grab me and kiss me.

31:43.474 --> 31:45.108
You kissed me.

31:45.142 --> 31:47.076
<i>And then there was</i>
<i>a lot of pretending</i>

31:47.111 --> 31:48.111
<i>that it didn't happen</i>

31:48.145 --> 31:49.379
and awkward back-and-forth

31:49.413 --> 31:51.080
and even dating
other people,

31:51.115 --> 31:55.785
<i>but one day,</i>
<i>one day when I was sure...</i>

31:55.819 --> 32:00.456
that you could never love
a nerd like me,

32:00.491 --> 32:02.425
you came over...

32:04.461 --> 32:06.062
<i>and I asked you</i>
<i>if you loved me.</i>

32:06.096 --> 32:07.163
Sarah, do you love me?

32:07.197 --> 32:10.566
And you, Sarah Walker...

32:10.601 --> 32:12.835
<i>said yes.</i>

32:12.870 --> 32:16.739
And when I asked
you to marry me,

32:16.774 --> 32:19.509
you didn't even have to say yes
<i>because we both knew,</i>

32:19.543 --> 32:21.594
<i>we both knew that we'd spend</i>
<i>the rest of our lives together.</i>

32:21.645 --> 32:24.480
So, please remember this house

32:24.515 --> 32:27.083
<i>and the red door</i>
<i>and the white picket fence</i>

32:27.117 --> 32:29.886
<i>and the family that we were</i>
<i>going to raise together</i>

32:29.920 --> 32:32.555
and remember me.

32:32.589 --> 32:36.192
Because if you remember me...

32:36.226 --> 32:40.930
then you'd remember...

32:40.964 --> 32:45.935
that a nerdy guy like me
who works at the Buy More...

32:45.969 --> 32:47.970
could make you happy.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.008
So I'm going to
give you a choice

32:52.042 --> 32:54.243
right here, right now.

32:54.261 --> 32:56.245
It's up to you.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.598
You can either
take a chance on me,

32:58.632 --> 33:01.134
and we can start over...

33:04.021 --> 33:06.122
(sniffling)

33:06.156 --> 33:08.157
...or you can take these glasses

33:08.192 --> 33:09.792
that you came for

33:09.827 --> 33:12.962
and never see me again.

33:16.650 --> 33:18.401
(sighs)

33:18.435 --> 33:21.771
This is real.

33:21.805 --> 33:23.790
You really love me?

33:24.742 --> 33:26.743
With all of my heart.

33:34.885 --> 33:37.887
I'm sorry,
I did my job too well.

33:38.956 --> 33:41.758
But I have a mission to finish,

33:41.792 --> 33:43.593
and I need
those glasses.

33:43.627 --> 33:45.194
No, you can't!

33:45.229 --> 33:46.195
Ow!

33:46.230 --> 33:47.597
Give them to me!

33:47.631 --> 33:49.348
Ahh!

33:49.399 --> 33:50.349
(glass shattering)

33:50.400 --> 33:51.768
Why won't you
fight back?

33:51.802 --> 33:53.102
I'm not gonna
fight you.

33:53.136 --> 33:55.104
(both grunting)

33:55.139 --> 33:57.023
I'm never gonna hurt you.

33:57.908 --> 34:00.076
Sarah, you're my wife!

34:05.082 --> 34:06.482
(groans)

34:06.517 --> 34:08.034
(grunts)

34:11.121 --> 34:13.505
(Chuck panting)

34:13.540 --> 34:16.626
(straining)

34:16.659 --> 34:19.178
(panting)

34:27.737 --> 34:29.105
(gun cocking)

34:29.139 --> 34:31.641
(panting)

34:31.675 --> 34:33.643
You can kill me.

34:33.677 --> 34:35.645
I will never hurt you.

34:45.155 --> 34:48.623
I wrote that.

34:48.659 --> 34:50.760
Yeah, you did.

34:50.793 --> 34:53.062
CHUCK (distorted, echoing):
<i>Honey, you know we don't...</i>

34:53.096 --> 34:54.563
SARAH:
I know...

34:54.598 --> 34:57.733
but we will...
one day,

34:57.768 --> 35:00.136
this will all be ours.

35:00.170 --> 35:03.072
And when it is, I would like
to always remember this moment.

35:03.106 --> 35:04.423
(voice echoing)

35:15.519 --> 35:18.087
Very good work,
Agent Walker.

35:18.121 --> 35:20.389
The glasses?

35:21.892 --> 35:24.293
You've lied to her!

35:24.328 --> 35:25.928
You used her!

35:29.967 --> 35:30.967
You're right.

35:32.903 --> 35:34.503
He's right, I'm not CIA.

35:34.538 --> 35:37.139
And, uh, I suppose I could
explain it all to you,

35:37.174 --> 35:39.308
but honestly,
you're not worth the time.

35:40.410 --> 35:42.378
QUINN:
Good-bye, Sarah.

35:42.412 --> 35:43.546
CHUCK: No!

35:45.716 --> 35:47.316
(bullets ricocheting)

35:47.351 --> 35:49.886
Oh, my God, are you okay?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.320
(sirens wailing in distance)

35:51.355 --> 35:53.155
I'm wearing a vest.

35:53.190 --> 35:57.293
They're coming
for you, Sarah.

35:57.327 --> 35:58.527
(sirens grow louder)

35:58.562 --> 35:59.862
(gasping): Run.

35:59.897 --> 36:02.531
But...
Run!

36:02.566 --> 36:04.634
(tires screeching,
men running to door)

36:05.769 --> 36:07.737
(gasping groan)

36:07.771 --> 36:09.372
(wheezing)

36:11.541 --> 36:12.975
He's here.

36:13.010 --> 36:14.660
Chuck?
Oh, my God. Chuck.

36:14.711 --> 36:16.078
Hi.

36:16.113 --> 36:17.146
Where's Sarah?

36:17.180 --> 36:20.116
She's gone.

36:20.150 --> 36:22.485
Sarah's gone.

36:27.278 --> 36:30.246
You're lucky the bullet
only hit your vest, bro.

36:30.281 --> 36:32.949
Yes, it's the best news
I've heard all day.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.450
(groaning)

36:34.485 --> 36:36.986
All right, all right, I'll get
you something for the pain.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.988
Thank you.

36:40.791 --> 36:42.792
I lost her, Ellie.

36:44.795 --> 36:47.697
For a split second, it felt like
she was starting to remember,

36:47.731 --> 36:48.731
but she's gone.

36:51.735 --> 36:54.137
Why don't you get some sleep.

36:54.171 --> 36:56.706
I'll be right here
when you wake up.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.846
Come on.

37:04.982 --> 37:06.933
(soft grunt)

37:06.984 --> 37:08.735
Thanks.

37:15.826 --> 37:17.427
Don't ever leave me.

37:17.461 --> 37:18.795
Never.

37:33.794 --> 37:35.478
Figured I'd find you here.

37:37.381 --> 37:39.215
You can put the knife down;
I'm not here to fight.

37:42.302 --> 37:44.520
What do you remember about me?

37:44.555 --> 37:47.657
Your reputation, mostly.

37:47.691 --> 37:50.460
Unfriendly, unforgiving and...

37:50.494 --> 37:52.462
unquestioning
about your orders.

37:52.496 --> 37:54.797
That's funny.

37:54.832 --> 37:57.333
When we met, people said
the same thing about you.

37:57.368 --> 37:59.168
Probably why we never got along,
huh?

37:59.203 --> 38:01.738
Well, if we didn't get along,
then why are you here?

38:09.413 --> 38:12.315
I guess Bartowski's
made us both a little soft.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.305
Beckman's got a new job
for me, but...

38:19.339 --> 38:23.192
these past five years,
we changed, you know.

38:23.227 --> 38:25.228
We became friends.

38:31.902 --> 38:33.903
Take care of yourself, Walker.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.238
(door opens)

38:35.272 --> 38:36.606
(door closes)

38:46.867 --> 38:48.951
SARAH (on video):
Day One.

38:48.986 --> 38:51.387
My mission is simple: find out
what he knows, gain his trust,

38:51.422 --> 38:52.688
and monitor his actions

38:52.723 --> 38:56.392
until the agency can decide
what to do with him.

38:58.162 --> 38:59.545
Day 21.

38:59.596 --> 39:02.432
Chuck came over to my hotel room
today and brought me a pizza.

39:02.466 --> 39:03.900
Vegetarian, no olives.

39:03.934 --> 39:06.686
I think he's making it
his mission to get to know me.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.371
It's sweet.

39:08.405 --> 39:09.972
Day 49.

39:10.007 --> 39:11.874
Chuck broke up with me today.

39:11.909 --> 39:16.512
Well, uh, Fake... Fake
broke up with me, technically.

39:16.530 --> 39:18.514
Day 56.

39:18.549 --> 39:21.250
Chuck I were defusing a bomb
today,

39:21.285 --> 39:26.222
and there was a moment where we
were sure we were going to die.

39:28.258 --> 39:32.428
He closed his eyes, and...

39:32.463 --> 39:34.096
I kissed him.

39:36.467 --> 39:41.437
I... kissed him.

39:41.472 --> 39:43.773
Day 564.

39:43.807 --> 39:45.808
Things are calm for once.

39:45.843 --> 39:50.246
No missions, nothing...
nothing really to report,

39:50.280 --> 39:56.185
except I still find myself
sitting here, talking to myself,

39:56.220 --> 39:59.121
because...

39:59.156 --> 40:01.157
because I love him.

40:05.195 --> 40:07.163
I love Chuck Bartowski,

40:07.197 --> 40:09.465
and I don't know
what to do about it.

40:11.735 --> 40:13.736
(sighs)

40:15.839 --> 40:19.074
You sure you don't want
to spend the night?

40:19.092 --> 40:20.877
You're more than welcome.

40:20.911 --> 40:23.513
I'm gonna have to
go home eventually.

40:23.547 --> 40:26.048
Tonight is as good a night
as any, I suppose.

40:26.083 --> 40:27.550
Okay.

40:27.584 --> 40:29.552
Well, I'm coming over
bright and early,

40:29.586 --> 40:31.854
and I'm making
you pancakes.

40:31.889 --> 40:33.689
Night, sis.

40:33.724 --> 40:35.608
Love you.

40:35.642 --> 40:37.527
Love you, too.

40:46.904 --> 40:49.906
SARAH:
Chuck?

40:52.910 --> 40:54.377
Sarah!

41:02.619 --> 41:06.055
I-I just wanted to tell you
that I believe you.

41:06.089 --> 41:10.693
I believe everything
that you told me about us.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.131
But...

41:15.165 --> 41:18.167
the truth is,
Chuck, I...

41:18.201 --> 41:20.436
I don't feel it.

41:20.470 --> 41:23.773
Everything that you told me
about us and our story--

41:23.807 --> 41:27.209
I just... I don't feel it.

41:27.244 --> 41:29.745
Right.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.180
(wry laugh)

41:31.214 --> 41:34.850
Right, of course, I...

41:34.885 --> 41:37.587
I don't know what
I was expecting,

41:37.621 --> 41:39.488
you know?

41:39.523 --> 41:42.592
So, what are you
doing here, then?

41:42.626 --> 41:47.496
Well, I wanted to say sorry for
everything that happened today.

41:51.201 --> 41:54.170
But, uh, most of all,
I wanted to say good-bye.

41:54.204 --> 41:57.340
Where are you going?

41:58.542 --> 42:01.077
Quinn took away my life,

42:01.111 --> 42:02.578
and I have to...

42:02.613 --> 42:04.614
Well, I have to go find him.

42:09.686 --> 42:11.687
Bye.

42:20.130 --> 42:23.065
Bye.
