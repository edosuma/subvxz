WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:28.820 --> 00:30.655
THE OTHER: The Tesseract.

00:31.322 --> 00:34.576
FURY: Legend tells us one thing.
History another.

00:34.659 --> 00:38.830
But every now and then we find something
that belongs to both.

00:39.831 --> 00:40.832
SELVIG: What is it?

00:40.915 --> 00:41.916
The Tesseract.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.253
FURY: Power, Doctor.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.882
Maybe unlimited power.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.887
(WHISPERS) Well,
I guess that's worth a look.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.556
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.686
WONG: At the dawn of the universe,

01:02.395 --> 01:08.068
Big Bang sent six elemental crystals
hurtling across the virgin universe.

01:08.151 --> 01:12.238
These Infinity Stones each control
an essential aspect of existence.

01:15.658 --> 01:19.704
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.918
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.713
You cannot control the power you hold.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.965
This will change the world.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.348
You could have the power of the gods!

01:38.431 --> 01:39.974
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:41.101 --> 01:42.102
RED SKULL: No!

01:43.436 --> 01:45.105
(SCREAMING)

01:59.369 --> 02:01.121
FURY: What do you remember about your dad?

02:01.955 --> 02:06.459
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.503
He was onto something big.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.590
LAWSON: This isn't about fighting wars.

02:12.674 --> 02:13.883
It's about ending them.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.973
Lawson was working on
a unique energy core.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.309
She developed a light-speed engine.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.520
(WARBLES)

02:28.189 --> 02:29.774
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.195
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.658
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.955
Is that it? The core?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.373
CAROL: It's the Tesseract.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.251
What's given can be taken away.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.047
(CAPTAIN MARVEL GRUNTS)

03:00.013 --> 03:02.265
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.184
Hidden.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.574
-Talk to me, Doctor.
-The Tesseract is misbehaving.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.326
She's throwing off interference.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.871
If there was any tampering, sir,
it wasn't at this end.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.206
"At this end"?

03:26.289 --> 03:29.709
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

03:31.961 --> 03:33.213
Doors open from both sides.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.969
(WARBLING)

03:42.430 --> 03:43.765
(GRUNTS)

03:45.391 --> 03:47.352
FURY: The Tesseract
is with a hostile force.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.272
As of right now, we are at war.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.943
We need you to look this over.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.570
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!

03:58.821 --> 03:59.822
(CHUCKLES)

04:03.117 --> 04:04.118
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

04:12.669 --> 04:14.170
Where are the Avengers?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.923
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.133
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.510
HAWLEY: And the Tesseract?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.887
FURY: The Tesseract is where it belongs.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.806
Out of our reach.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.232
-Odin's treasures.
-Fake.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.316
(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

04:35.400 --> 04:37.402
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.862
(SIGHS) Or weak.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.115
That's not bad.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.075
(PANTING)

04:49.956 --> 04:52.208
THANOS: I know what it's like to lose.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.586
The Tesseract.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.338
Or your brother's head.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.091
(SCREAMING)

05:03.261 --> 05:04.304
All right, stop!

05:06.306 --> 05:07.807
(THOR GASPING)

05:07.890 --> 05:09.976
We don't have the Tesseract.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.811
It was destroyed on Asgard.

05:21.696 --> 05:25.450
(PANTING) You really are
the worst brother.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.762
BANNER: He has the Power and Space Stones.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.015
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

05:49.098 --> 05:52.226
He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.478
(SCREAMING)

06:00.902 --> 06:01.903
No!

06:01.986 --> 06:04.697
ROMANOFF: He did exactly
what he said he was gonna do.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.284
Thanos wiped out 50%
of all living creatures.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.163
The stones are in the past.
We could go back, we could get them.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.334
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.756
STARK: There's our stone.
