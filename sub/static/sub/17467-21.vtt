WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:07.050
Man, just looking at this
thing makes me miss cocaine.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.444
Sadly, I can remember you
wearing one of those

00:09.487 --> 00:11.359
to my second grade
spelling bee.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.665
Excuse me, but you were
the only eight-year-old

00:13.709 --> 00:15.102
who could spell
"inappropriate."

00:17.278 --> 00:18.975
Guys, look at these cute bras
Emily picked out.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.455
Can you please
stop saying "bra"?

00:20.498 --> 00:22.544
Would you rather
I say "brassiere"?

00:22.587 --> 00:24.285
Brassiere.

00:24.328 --> 00:27.331
B-R-A-S-S-I-E-R-E.
Brassiere.

00:27.375 --> 00:31.074
Yeah. I think there's a "Z"
in there, but nice try.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.858
Here, let's go try 'em on.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.686
You're coming
in the dressing room with me?

00:34.730 --> 00:37.559
Oh, honey, God gave us boobies.
It's nothing to be shy about.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.256
Tell her the truth.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.563
Dr. Feingold gave you those
boobies, and that nose.

00:41.606 --> 00:42.955
Go ahead, Emily.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.741
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.656
I bet Adam would love
to see me in this.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.353
That's not your size.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.051
Excuse me.
I'm 52 years old.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.922
I think I know
my bra size.

00:52.965 --> 00:55.664
[chuckles] Neither of
those things are true.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.231
Try this one.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.015
Fine, but when
I'm floppin' around

00:59.059 --> 01:02.758
like two kittens in a sack,
I expect an apology.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.194
[gasps] These are cute.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.153
Em, how are you fixed
for panties?

01:06.196 --> 01:08.111
EMILY:
Please stop talking!

01:08.155 --> 01:11.375
BONNIE: I'll take a few thongs
if you're buying!

01:11.419 --> 01:14.074
She's too old
for thongs.

01:14.117 --> 01:18.121
We're just happy
she's wearing underwear now.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.862
I hope Emily's having
a good time.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.864
Do you think
she's having a good time?

01:21.907 --> 01:23.474
Of course she is.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.607
She's acting embarrassed,
but she's having a blast.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.565
You've made a big
difference in her life.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.090
Thanks. She's made
a big difference in mine.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.787
Her mom still in rehab?

01:31.830 --> 01:34.746
Yeah, we're supposed
to go see her tomorrow.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.792
I hope it doesn't
set Emily back.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.273
She'll be okay.
It's her mom.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.189
Will you look at these!
The bra troll nailed it!

01:44.060 --> 01:45.061
Inappropriate.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.238
I-N-A-P-P-R-O-P-R-I-A-T-E.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.631
Inappropriate.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.200
â™ª

02:08.911 --> 02:10.565
Notice anything
different about me?

02:10.608 --> 02:12.044
Oh, boy, not this game.

02:12.088 --> 02:15.439
Um... your hair,
your skin,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.137
you lost weight,
you gained weight.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.661
Whatever it is,
I love it.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.837
I got a new bra.

02:21.880 --> 02:22.881
And I love it.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.187
You want to see it?

02:24.231 --> 02:27.973
Um... maybe we should
save it for make-up sex.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.627
But we're not fighting.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.412
Wait for it.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.936
What did you do?

02:33.979 --> 02:35.329
[laughs]:
Nothing.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.808
But I need a favor.

02:36.852 --> 02:37.940
Uh-huh.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.072
I have to go to a
funeral, and I was

02:40.116 --> 02:42.379
hoping that you'd watch my
dog for a couple of days.

02:42.423 --> 02:43.685
Who died?

02:43.728 --> 02:46.470
A woman that was like
a second mother to me.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.168
Well, why would we fight
about that?

02:48.211 --> 02:50.126
Of course I'll watch your dog.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.562
Thank you.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.956
But why isn't he staying
with your ex-wife?

02:53.999 --> 02:55.087
Okay, here we go.

02:57.089 --> 03:00.571
Well, she will also be
at the funeral.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.965
Interesting.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.227
And why is that?

03:04.271 --> 03:06.925
It was her mother who died.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.885
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.976
Uh-huh.

03:14.019 --> 03:17.371
Like I said,
we were really close.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.721
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.680
And why can't you just go
for the day and come back?

03:22.724 --> 03:24.247
Where is this funeral?

03:24.291 --> 03:27.119
I want to say Detroit,
but I have to say Hawaii.

03:29.513 --> 03:32.037
Oh, come on!

03:32.081 --> 03:34.953
You're going with your ex-wife
to Hawaii?!

03:34.997 --> 03:36.041
For a funeral.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.129
In Hawaii.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.305
For a funeral.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.045
In Hawaii.
Okay.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.265
I feel like this could
go on for a long time.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.312
You're wrong. It's over.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.531
I will happily watch your dog.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.446
We are not gonna
fight about this.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.492
Well, we kind of already did.No, that wasn't a fight.

03:51.535 --> 03:52.841
Well, you wouldn't let
the Hawaii thing go.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.538
It's Hawaii!For a funeral!

03:54.582 --> 03:56.932
Whoa, you happy?!
We're fighting now!

03:59.543 --> 04:01.153
Hawaii.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.677
For a funeral.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.244
Don't take his side.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.463
Everybody knows
funerals lead to sex.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.509
The crying, the grieving--
it's all foreplay.

04:08.552 --> 04:09.945
I didn't know that.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.077
I lost my virginity
at a funeral.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.690
It was great.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.387
Hey, this is the part
where you guys tell me

04:17.430 --> 04:19.041
I'm being insane and have
nothing to worry about.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.390
Bonnie, you're
being insane,

04:20.434 --> 04:21.738
and there's nothing
to worry about.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.698
Don't just repeat
it back to me.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.962
Okay, how's this?

04:27.005 --> 04:30.444
Adam and Danielle may be sharing
an emotional experience.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.055
Near a big, shiny, black coffin.

04:37.581 --> 04:41.629
But he asked you to take care
of his furry, flatulent,

04:41.672 --> 04:44.980
16-year-old dog who has
a taste for underwear.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.504
It does show that
he loves you.
Exactly.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.637
Totally.
Good, good, this is
what I was looking for.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.073
It's gonna be fine.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.075
As long as nothing happens
to the dog.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.558
Isn't there a pallbearer
around here you could hump?

04:57.601 --> 04:59.951
I wish.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.345
It really was great.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.564
Hey.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.870
Hey. How'd it go with
Emily and her mom?

05:05.914 --> 05:08.612
Oh, I didn't take her.
We went to a movie instead.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.962
What do you mean
you didn't take her?

05:11.006 --> 05:12.355
Well, it wasn't my idea.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.661
Emily said
she didn't want to go,

05:13.704 --> 05:15.402
so what was I supposed
to do, make her?

05:15.445 --> 05:17.969
Yes. That's the definition
of parenting:

05:18.013 --> 05:20.363
forcing kids to do things
they don't want to do.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.539
BONNIE:
It's true.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.193
Remember when you were
little and were afraid

05:24.236 --> 05:25.542
to go to sleep
without the light on?

05:25.586 --> 05:26.804
But I got you through it.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.980
You're gonna take a bow

05:29.024 --> 05:30.591
for not paying
the electric bill?

05:34.638 --> 05:36.727
I'm sorry, but Emily
opened up to me about her mom.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.555
That woman's not trying
to get sober.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.036
She's just using rehab as
a "get out of jail free" card.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.908
Jill, I think it's great
you're concerned about Emily,

05:43.952 --> 05:45.649
but aren't these
visits mandatory?

05:45.693 --> 05:48.609
Yeah, they could take her away
from you if you don't do it.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.350
Well, then maybe
I'll take her someplace

05:50.393 --> 05:51.568
where nobody can find us.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.657
That's called kidnapping.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.399
How about Hawaii?

05:56.443 --> 05:58.183
I need some eyes
on the ground there.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.576
What?

05:59.620 --> 06:02.100
She's nervous about
Adam going to Hawaii

06:02.144 --> 06:03.754
with his ex-wife for a funeral.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.190
Oh, and she should be.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.496
Funerals are basically orgies

06:06.540 --> 06:08.324
with a cold, stiff guy
in the corner.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.282
Amen, sister.

06:13.155 --> 06:16.419
Yeah, you like me better
than his mean old ex-wife.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.943
Yes, you do.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.859
Yes, you...

06:21.903 --> 06:25.254
What's this?

06:25.297 --> 06:27.387
Christy?

06:27.430 --> 06:29.780
Christy, get down here!

06:29.824 --> 06:31.695
What?
What's the matter?

06:31.739 --> 06:33.741
He's got a lump.So?

06:33.784 --> 06:36.134
Well, I don't think he had it
before he got here.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.963
He grew a lump in two hours?

06:39.007 --> 06:41.749
I think so. I don't know.
Here, touch it.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.968
I'm not touching it.Touch the lump!

06:47.668 --> 06:48.886
Yeah, that's a lump.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.453
What should we do?

06:50.497 --> 06:51.846
I don't know.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.239
I never had a dog
'cause my mom never got me one.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.459
Oh, please.
Dogs are for good children.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.461
What do you want me to say?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.420
If you're worried,
take him to the vet.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.161
[sighs] Life was
going so good.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.815
Now my boyfriend's
rubbing suntan lotion

07:04.859 --> 07:06.164
on his ex-wife's back,

07:06.208 --> 07:08.297
and I'm taking
his lumpy dog to the vet.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.907
Mom?
Yeah?

07:09.951 --> 07:12.257
If it makes you feel better,
your life was never going good.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.786
I really appreciate
you squeezing us in.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.352
I'm worried sick.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.703
It's not a problem.
Uh, who referred you?

07:22.746 --> 07:25.183
Nobody. You just had
a friendly face on Yelp.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.620
Oh, thanks.

07:26.663 --> 07:29.144
It's also my
Tinder picture.

07:29.187 --> 07:32.147
Well... you can relax.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.670
Lump's just fatty tissue.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.585
It's very common
in dogs his age.

07:35.629 --> 07:36.891
So he's not gonna die?

07:36.934 --> 07:38.806
Well, we're all gonna die.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.372
I mean by Sunday at 8:00?

07:40.416 --> 07:41.809
I think you're okay.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.201
[sighs]:
Great.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.813
So I'm assuming
no problem, no charge?

07:45.856 --> 07:47.684
Oh, no, there's
a charge.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.469
Really? You basically
just petted him.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.993
With hands that were stupid
enough to buy a boat.

07:52.036 --> 07:55.126
Check okay?
Sure.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.520
Boy, you thought
you regretted buying a boat.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.917
This place gives
me the creeps.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.049
Reminds me of when
I was in rehab.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.878
Really? 'Cause when
I visited you in rehab,

08:07.922 --> 08:10.315
the pool boy led me
out to your cabana.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.970
Doesn't mean
it wasn't hard.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.190
That pool was
not heated.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.845
Here they come.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.238
Hey, Jill.
My mom wanted to say hi.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.849
Hey, it's nice
to meet you.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.459
Get over here, you.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.766
Thank you so much for
taking care of my girl.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.768
Oh, it's my pleasure.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.596
Emily didn't tell me
you were such a knockout.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.598
How come you didn't have
any kids of your own?

08:31.641 --> 08:33.861
Well, I'm divorced,
and we just never...

08:33.904 --> 08:36.472
I'm kidding. You're smart.
Keep that hot body.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.562
Hi, I'm Christy, Jill's friend.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.956
Natasha. Hey, you
look familiar.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.349
You must be thinking about
that frying pan commercial.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.177
Everyone says I
look like the woman

08:46.221 --> 08:48.876
who gets her eggs to
slide out super easy.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.268
That's not it.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.096
Did you ever dance
at Live Nudes?

08:55.622 --> 09:00.235
Uh, it was a long time ago.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.933
But they still use my picture
in the print ads.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.979
I used to work
there, too.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.937
I bet we slid down
the same pole.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.070
Oh, excuse me!
[chuckles]

09:09.113 --> 09:10.462
Child in the room.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.595
Relax. This one
knows I stripped.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.598
I learned my numbers
counting singles.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.687
Sweetie, why don't we
go get something

09:17.731 --> 09:19.167
from the vending machine?

09:19.210 --> 09:22.779
Don't get the Cheetos;
they never fall.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.694
Wow, this is so wild.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.217
You know, I'm
suing that club.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.654
You still work there?

09:27.697 --> 09:29.786
No, I hit 40, they put me
on the breakfast shift.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.092
Ooh.
That's right.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.267
Age discrimination.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.268
And look at that ass.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.661
That's hard as a rock.

09:34.704 --> 09:35.705
Go on, slap it.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.838
I believe you.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.404
Slap it.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.626
Ow.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.106
Very firm.
[chuckles]

09:45.149 --> 09:47.499
That's right. You can crack
a walnut on that thing.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.893
[chuckles]
Hey, hey, hey.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.547
Remember how I always
wanted to be a singer?

09:51.591 --> 09:55.725
Honestly, I don't really
remember the '90s.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.771
I'm just now catching up
on Friends.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.207
[imitates Joey]:
"How you doin'?"

10:00.338 --> 10:01.557
I'm good.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.125
Anyway,

10:04.168 --> 10:06.431
I met this guy who knows
a record producer in L.A.,

10:06.475 --> 10:09.043
and as soon as I get down there,
he'll help me make a demo.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.262
A guy who knows a guy in L.A.

10:11.306 --> 10:14.091
That's how I wound up
auditioning for a "movie."

10:15.702 --> 10:17.399
So, how's it going in here?

10:17.442 --> 10:18.792
You liking sobriety?

10:18.835 --> 10:21.708
Come on, Christy,
nobody likes sobriety.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.100
I do.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.885
I've got four years
and I love it.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.321
Get out. You?

10:26.364 --> 10:27.757
I remember watching you
spin around the pole

10:27.801 --> 10:28.802
while you were vomiting.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.455
You were like a lawn sprinkler.

10:31.935 --> 10:36.157
Not a good day to be
a Japanese businessman.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.551
But now I'm in college,
studying to be a lawyer.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.379
Really?
Yeah.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.555
You can pretty much do anything
once you're sober.

10:43.599 --> 10:46.210
As long as you're in here,
why not give it a real try?

10:46.254 --> 10:48.909
Oh, I have tried.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.606
Well, how about this time
I help you?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.348
You know, we can talk,
work the steps, go to meetings.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.697
You would do that?

10:54.741 --> 10:56.046
Hey, we're pole pals.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.614
I think we made out once.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.966
Here's my number.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.185
Call me.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.667
Natasha, I got you a
bunch of sugar snacks.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.234
You can probably trade
them for some cigarettes.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.628
Thank you.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.456
Hey, great news, baby.

11:14.499 --> 11:15.849
Christy's gonna help me
get out of here

11:15.892 --> 11:17.459
so you and me can move to L.A.

11:17.502 --> 11:20.375
How long were we gone?

11:27.643 --> 11:28.862
Home.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.733
BONNIE:
Kitchen.

11:30.777 --> 11:31.821
What's going on?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.475
I'm trying to get him
to take his pill,

11:33.518 --> 11:35.216
but he keeps spitting it out.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.000
Did you try hiding it
in something?

11:37.044 --> 11:38.480
I tried hamburger, cheese,
peanut butter,

11:38.523 --> 11:40.308
and somehow he spits it out
every time.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.092
He's like a street magician.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.660
You gave the dog my hamburger?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.314
At this point,
I'd give him a $100

11:46.357 --> 11:48.185
if he'd swallow the damn pill.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.100
Come on, Samson, please?

11:50.144 --> 11:52.320
Don't you want your
blood pressure regulated?

11:52.363 --> 11:55.192
[gruff voice]:
"Well, in a perfect world,

11:55.236 --> 11:57.978
I'd rather be licking my balls."

12:00.415 --> 12:02.417
I am not amused.

12:02.460 --> 12:06.029
That's because
you're dead inside.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.683
Give me that.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.121
[ringtone playing]

12:11.165 --> 12:12.862
Hello?

12:12.906 --> 12:15.865
Hey, Natasha, what's going on?

12:15.909 --> 12:17.345
Calm down, calm down.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.999
[gasps] It's working.
He's eating it.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.304
Hang on.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.480
Okay, just sit tight.
I'll be right there.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.743
Is everything all right?

12:23.786 --> 12:26.180
Emily's mom is freaking out.
I got to go.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.008
Oh, are you kidding me?

12:28.051 --> 12:29.487
You spit it out again?

12:29.531 --> 12:31.359
Samson, you're making me crazy.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.927
[gruff voice]: "Sorry, I'm just
trying to keep your mind off

12:33.970 --> 12:37.321
Adam banging his ex-wife
in Hawaii."

12:42.283 --> 12:43.806
Tried everything.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.678
I even ground it up
to see if he'd snort it.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.898
You know, like the kids do
with their drugs.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.860
Anyway, I defy you
to get a pill in this dog.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.513
There you go.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.733
No, no, give it a minute;
he'll spit it out.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.479
All right, remind me
the name I used

13:04.522 --> 13:06.437
on the last check
I gave you.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.355
It's not safe here;
you got to get me out.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.792
What happened?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.663
Okay, so I was singing,
you know, doing my warm-ups.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.013
That stupid meth head I share
a room with told me to shut up,

13:17.057 --> 13:19.755
so I smacked her,
and for no reason, she bit me.

13:19.799 --> 13:24.151
Just your luck, you found
a meth head with teeth.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.153
Story of my life.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.503
So I was thinking,
how about I go grab my Uggs

13:28.546 --> 13:30.635
and cassette deck
and crash with you for a while?

13:30.679 --> 13:33.595
[chuckles]
That's funny.

13:33.638 --> 13:34.988
Why?

13:35.031 --> 13:38.382
My mom said the same thing
to me four years ago.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.558
Come on, you said
you were gonna help me.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.083
I can't get sober here.
These people are crazy.

13:43.126 --> 13:46.303
The people here aren't the
problem, you are the problem.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.566
You got that off the poster
in the bathroom.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.440
Natasha, you need
to trust me on this.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.050
You're still detoxing,
which means

13:54.094 --> 13:56.748
every single thought you
have is wrong and bad.

13:56.792 --> 13:57.924
But I'm just...Wrong.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.403
I understand...Bad!

13:59.447 --> 14:00.448
You're not even trying
to hear what I'm...!

14:00.491 --> 14:02.276
Wrong and bad!

14:02.319 --> 14:04.626
And if you keep talking,
I'm gonna throw in "stupid."

14:07.107 --> 14:08.848
See, Samson, this is you.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.157
Oh, look, the check
bouncer's back.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.507
It's cute you think
that insults me.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.682
Hmm.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.424
So, what's not the problem now?

14:20.468 --> 14:22.731
He's breathing a little funny.

14:22.774 --> 14:25.821
Ah, he's 16 years old; it's
a miracle he's breathing at all.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.215
You know, at this point,

14:28.258 --> 14:30.130
I'm actually a little
more worried about you.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.696
I'm fine.
Ah.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.698
My boyfriend just asked me
to take care of his dog

14:33.742 --> 14:35.744
while he's at a funeral
with his ex-wife in Hawaii,

14:35.787 --> 14:36.963
so that's what I'm doing.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.312
Hawaii?

14:38.355 --> 14:39.966
For a funeral.But Hawaii?

14:40.009 --> 14:43.752
I know. Who dies in Hawaii?

14:43.795 --> 14:45.667
You know, I think I
see what's happening.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.669
You're worried about
your boyfriend,

14:47.712 --> 14:50.498
and you're transferring
that anxiety to the dog.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.284
I hate how much sense
that makes.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.633
Hmm.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.897
Plus, he never would've
left his dog with you

14:57.940 --> 14:59.942
unless he loved you
and trusted you.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.118
My daughter said
the same thing,

15:02.162 --> 15:04.904
but somehow it's easier
to trust a total stranger.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.209
[chuckles softly]

15:06.253 --> 15:08.211
Thank you.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.430
You're welcome.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.998
What do I owe you?

15:12.041 --> 15:14.522
Oh, I don't know, how
about a million dollars?

15:14.565 --> 15:16.480
Okay, just don't
cash it till Friday.
Ah.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.224
No, Natasha, that's wrong.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.096
Yeah, still wrong.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.706
That's okay.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.795
You're gonna be wrong
for about five years.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.493
All right, bye-bye.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.147
What did she
want to do?

15:31.191 --> 15:32.757
Host a casino night
at the rehab

15:32.801 --> 15:34.455
and get everybody's
disability checks.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.022
Oh.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.850
Tried it.
It's a bitch cashing them.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.810
At least she asked before
she did it. That's progress.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.465
I know.
I really think I'm helping her.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.466
Good for you.

15:45.509 --> 15:46.771
Yeah, terrific.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.295
Problem, Jill?

15:48.338 --> 15:49.992
No, no problem.
I just don't see why

15:50.036 --> 15:51.994
Christy has to slap
her little sober cape on

15:52.038 --> 15:53.387
and save the world.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.650
What are you talking about?

15:55.693 --> 15:57.913
I'm trying to help
another alcoholic.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.872
Yeah, well,
maybe you shouldn't.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.744
Don't look at me like that.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.746
You all know Emily's
better off with me.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.922
That woman has chosen
drinking over her daughter

16:06.966 --> 16:08.141
a million times.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.012
She does not deserve
to get her back.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.493
Hey, you just described me
four years ago.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.712
Are you saying I didn't
deserve to keep my kids?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.279
I'm not talking about you.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.281
You're talking about
someone exactly like me.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.804
And if someone
hadn't helped me,

16:19.848 --> 16:20.936
I would've lost them.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.111
You're welcome.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.028
Talking about
Marjorie, Mom.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.902
Fine, help Natasha.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.556
And when they take Emily
away from me

16:32.600 --> 16:34.036
and that woman puts her
through hell

16:34.080 --> 16:35.907
and she gets stuck
in another foster home,

16:35.951 --> 16:37.779
you can feel real proud
of yourself.

16:37.822 --> 16:41.826
You were in rehab over and over,
and we never gave up on you

16:41.870 --> 16:43.611
'cause we don't
throw people away!

16:45.917 --> 16:47.223
For the record,
I'm not storming out.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.616
I'm just leaving
'cause she's my ride.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.798
Okay, so here's
where you write down

16:56.841 --> 16:58.843
everyone you resent
in your life.

16:58.887 --> 17:01.542
And then, you write
everything they did to you.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.544
And then,
most important,

17:03.587 --> 17:05.894
you write down the part
you played in it.

17:05.936 --> 17:07.896
But I didn't do anything.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.160
Natasha, you're in a rehab,

17:11.204 --> 17:14.076
your kid's in foster care and
you had to get a tetanus shot

17:14.119 --> 17:16.296
because a meth head bit you
on your punching hand.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.342
You sure you didn't
do anything?

17:19.386 --> 17:21.431
You think I'm a terrible
person, don't you?

17:23.954 --> 17:27.002
I think you're a person
who's done terrible things.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.657
Just like I have.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.615
But I got better
and so can you.

17:31.659 --> 17:35.054
I so want to make out
with you right now.

17:36.751 --> 17:39.884
But I think it might
be a bad idea.

17:39.928 --> 17:43.584
Look at you,
growing, learning.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.023
Hi, Mom.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.199
Baby, I didn't know
you were coming today.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.419
Well, we were getting our nails
done nowhere near here,

17:52.462 --> 17:54.899
so we thought we'd swing by.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.684
Thank you.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.077
This is real thoughtful.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.426
Hey,

17:59.469 --> 18:01.515
I remember how lonely
rehab can be.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.734
You were in rehab?

18:03.778 --> 18:05.475
Four times.

18:05.519 --> 18:08.391
Hers had a spa
and sushi.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.873
Well, it was just
a masseuse and a hot tub.

18:11.916 --> 18:16.138
And we only had
sushi on Wednesdays.

18:16.182 --> 18:20.229
But I was still scared and
wanted to drink every day.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.492
CHRISTY:
And look at her now.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.712
She hasn't driven a Maserati
into a dry cleaners

18:24.755 --> 18:25.713
in three years.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.762
Yeah, without Christy's help,
I never would've made it.

18:31.806 --> 18:35.114
Yeah, I'm in good hands
with Bambi here.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.463
Bambi?

18:36.506 --> 18:38.856
It was my stripper name.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.601
You named yourself
after a baby deer

18:44.645 --> 18:47.213
who watched his mom get
her head blown off?

18:49.215 --> 18:51.130
I had the big eyes.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.314
Hey, you came back![laughs]

19:01.357 --> 19:03.272
Hey, baby. Mm.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.752
I missed you so much.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.449
I missed you, too.

19:06.493 --> 19:07.842
Any problems with Samson?

19:07.885 --> 19:10.018
He was fine. So easy.

19:10.061 --> 19:13.413
I want to watch him every time
you go away with your ex-wife.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.718
So was it fun?

19:14.762 --> 19:16.807
I mean, not fun, but how was it?

19:16.851 --> 19:18.331
Okay, I guess.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.898
98-year-old women
should not have an open casket.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.727
But I did have a chance
to buy you a little something.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.599
You shouldn't have. Give it.

19:25.642 --> 19:26.600
[laughs]

19:26.643 --> 19:27.905
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.733
I love it.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.214
I got to tell you, Bon, after
three days with my ex-wife,

19:32.258 --> 19:34.564
I have never been more happy
that you're my girl.

19:34.608 --> 19:38.046
Okay, now, that is
the real gift.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.048
[both sigh]

19:40.091 --> 19:41.876
So how about you
show me that bra

19:41.919 --> 19:43.486
I didn't get a
chance to see.

19:43.530 --> 19:44.966
Certainly.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.359
Samson, Daddy's home.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.278
Yesterday, on our walk,
I picked up the matching panties

19:52.321 --> 19:54.715
with a pooper scooper.Hmm.
