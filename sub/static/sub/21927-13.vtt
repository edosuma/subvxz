00:02.711 --> 00:05.670
A simile directly compares
two things,

00:05.881 --> 00:08.589
using the words "like" and "as."

00:09.051 --> 00:10.633
<i>"I slept
like a log."</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:12.843
"I'm hungry as a horse."

00:13.430 --> 00:15.171
"Your love is like
bad medicine."

00:15.390 --> 00:16.300
Exactly.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.633
That's Bon Jovi.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.137
Okay.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.844
His hair is awesome.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.053
<i>Moving on.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:25.140
Metaphors are different
from similes.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.153
<i>I've been called a germophobe,</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:33.448
<i>but I do find
a single sneeze acceptable.</i>

00:33.659 --> 00:35.776
<i>It could be caused
by dust, allergies...</i>

00:35.994 --> 00:38.953
<i>really, whatever nasal irritant
floats your boat.</i>

00:39.331 --> 00:40.367
<i>However...</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:42.911
<i>during flu season...</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:48.796
<i>...a second sneeze means
a plague is upon the land,</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:50.589
<i>and it's every man for himself.</i>

00:52.594 --> 00:54.005
Where do you think
you're going?

00:54.471 --> 00:55.507
Away from you.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.587
Why's that?

00:57.099 --> 00:58.260
I want to live.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.309
I'm not sick.
Get back in your seat.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.476
No, thank you.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.519
You know the rules.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.563
You can't leave
without a hall pass.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.812
May I have a hall pass?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.108
No, you may not.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.936
Now get back in your seat.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.693
<i>Rules
are the pillars of society.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:15.989
<i>I love rules.</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:18.193
<i>But what benefit are rules
to a dead man?</i>

01:44.980 --> 01:46.141
Excuse me.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.307
Do I look like
I'm getting sick to you?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.646
You look a little pale.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.523
Okay, good, that's normal.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.778
Now, I understand Sheldon
is an exceptional child,

01:57.993 --> 01:59.200
<i>all right,
but when he</i>

01:59.411 --> 02:01.073
willfully disobeys
the order of a teacher,

02:01.288 --> 02:03.280
there needs
to be some consequences here.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.327
Oh, we couldn't
agree more.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.033
What kind of punishment
are you thinking?

02:07.794 --> 02:10.662
Well, Mary, in a case like this,
a few days of detention.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.622
Really? That seems
a little harsh.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.707
Oh, detention's
no big deal.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.260
Now, my principal used to
whup my ass with a paddle.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.720
<i>That got
my attention.</i>

02:19.931 --> 02:22.218
Oh, yeah.
Those were the days.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.266
Still have mine.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.178
Ah.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.272
Ol' Spanky.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.515
Whoa.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.479
- Got a real nice grip on that thing.
- Yeah, George.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.030
Had the equipment manager over
at the Astros make this for me.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.157
The holes in it...

02:40.994 --> 02:42.576
cut down on wind resistance.

02:42.871 --> 02:43.531
Smart.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.577
But these days you have
to have a consent form

02:46.792 --> 02:48.499
to whack the kids.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.369
I don't know
where this world's headed.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.830
You ought to get one of those
for when Georgie acts up.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.624
Like you never thought
about going upside his head

02:56.843 --> 02:57.799
with a slab of wood.

02:59.388 --> 03:02.301
You know, there was a time
this thing gave me tennis elbow.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.146
Okay, Sheldon, come o...

03:20.242 --> 03:21.107
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

03:21.910 --> 03:22.650
Thataway.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.392
What you
doing, kid?!

03:58.530 --> 04:00.396
<i>Enjoy this. It is, by far,</i>

04:00.615 --> 04:03.198
<i>the most athletic two minutes
of my entire life.</i>

04:11.543 --> 04:12.533
It's not funny.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.709
Oh, come on, now.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.833
Sheldon in detention...
that's funny.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.877
<i>I actually think
it'd be good for him.</i>

04:19.091 --> 04:20.708
He needs to learn
he's not special.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.426
But he <i>is</i> special.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.503
You know what I mean.
He can't just

04:24.723 --> 04:26.635
walk out of a classroom
'cause he feels like it.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.216
He was worried
about catching a cold.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.176
That is a legitimate concern.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.307
And now he's in danger
of being mugged

04:32.522 --> 04:34.434
by a roomful of hoodlums.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.481
He's not getting mugged.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.229
It's half a dozen kids
doing homework

04:38.445 --> 04:39.606
while a teacher watches 'em.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.029
Although it might not hurt
to give Sheldon a few dollars

04:42.240 --> 04:44.027
to buy himself
some protection.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.734
That's actually not a bad idea.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.534
What are you doing?

04:56.046 --> 04:56.877
Nothing.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.455
Is that
chewing tobacco?

04:59.674 --> 05:02.041
It's chocolate Bazooka.
What do you want?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.877
I have detention tomorrow,

05:04.095 --> 05:06.052
and I thought you could
give me some tips.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.756
That was pretty badass, you
walking out of class like that.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.351
It was not my intention to be
bad "A" word, but thank you.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.229
The only thing you need
to worry about in detention

05:15.440 --> 05:16.976
is staying close
to the teacher.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.525
If he leaves the room,
you go with him.

05:20.195 --> 05:20.855
Why?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.521
'Cause you're gonna
get your "A" word kicked.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.695
Are you saying I'll be
in physical danger?

05:26.910 --> 05:28.776
It's all the worst kids
in school

05:29.037 --> 05:30.153
in one room for an hour.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.159
What do you think's
gonna happen?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.832
I thought we were gonna spend
the time regretting our actions

05:35.043 --> 05:37.877
and thinking about how we could
be better in the future.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.205
Well, you thought wrong.
Get lost.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.048
You're both mean
and nice to me.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.092
It's confusing.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.227
Maybe I'm doing this wrong.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.902
Have you ever been in detention?

06:03.697 --> 06:04.608
No.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.614
But I do take
the school bus.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.653
And that is no party.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.410
It's like a mental hospital
on wheels.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.488
That's a good use of simile.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.121
Thanks.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.824
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.496
I hope.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.760
Hello. I'm here
for detention.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.471
Where is the teacher?

06:39.858 --> 06:41.224
Not here yet.

06:42.193 --> 06:42.979
Oh.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.157
I have three dollars.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.859
Feel free to share it
with the others.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.004
Would you prefer
a piece of paper?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.002
I have some
in my briefcase.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.422
It's here
if you change your mind.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.846
All right, losers,
you know how this works.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.219
One hour, no talking,
no horseplay.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.466
Sheldon?

07:15.685 --> 07:17.176
Hello, Mr. Givens.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.473
Why are you here?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.850
I didn't want to catch a cold
from Ms. MacElroy,

07:21.066 --> 07:23.479
so I left her classroom
without a hall pass.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.185
Well, something <i>is</i> going around.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.316
I actually had a little tickle
in my throat.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.948
Okay, time to go.
Nice meeting you.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.366
Whoa, what-what are you doing?

07:32.744 --> 07:34.155
You've heard of
fight or flight?

07:34.496 --> 07:35.782
This is flight.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.036
Not so funny
now, is it?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.618
No. How long
is he suspended for?

07:42.837 --> 07:43.793
A week.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.462
And it goes on
his permanent record.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.290
<i>Well, that's
no big deal.</i>

07:47.509 --> 07:50.718
I had all kinds of stuff on my
permanent high school record.

07:50.929 --> 07:54.138
Didn't stop me from being
a bartender for eight years.

07:54.349 --> 07:57.183
I think the real issue we need
to deal with is his germ phobia.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.092
<i>Oh, yes,
you don't</i>

07:58.311 --> 08:00.098
want him turning
into Howard Hughes.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.054
Growing his nails out.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.731
Peeing in a jar.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.775
Why would he pee into a jar?
I don't know why he peed in a jar,

08:06.987 --> 08:08.649
I just know he did.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.354
I hate to say it,

08:10.573 --> 08:12.405
but I think
we need help with this.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.865
- Like what?
<i>- Maybe we could</i>

08:14.077 --> 08:16.319
take him to that nice doctor
who calmed him down

08:16.538 --> 08:18.780
when he was convinced
he had an enlarged prostate?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.365
Sheldon only calmed down
when the doctor told him

08:20.583 --> 08:22.415
what happens in a prostate exam.

08:23.044 --> 08:23.909
Poor thing.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.836
Still talks about it.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.754
<i>Thank you for seeing us,
Doctor.</i>

08:31.011 --> 08:31.717
No problem.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.217
So, what do you got today,
Sheldon?

08:35.557 --> 08:37.423
Rickets?
Rabies?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.474
Early-onset menopause?

08:40.437 --> 08:41.553
Is he making a joke?

08:41.770 --> 08:42.886
I believe so.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.062
Humorous.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.186
- Hmm.
- Sheldon's not sick,

08:46.401 --> 08:48.984
but he has become overly
concerned with getting a cold

08:49.195 --> 08:51.187
<i>- or the flu.</i>
- Well, any symptoms...

08:51.406 --> 08:52.817
runny nose, achy,

08:53.033 --> 08:54.945
- sore throat, fever?
- No.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.073
All right, well, Sheldon,
if you do catch a cold,

08:58.288 --> 09:01.656
or even the flu, it's...
it's not the end of the world.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.746
The flu was the end of the world
for half a million Americans

09:04.961 --> 09:07.954
during the influenza epidemic
of 1918.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.204
- Really?
<i>- In India</i>

09:09.632 --> 09:11.464
17 million people died.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.838
Okay, I think we're getting
off the subject. Doctor,

09:14.054 --> 09:15.386
<i>Sheldon is afraid
to go to school</i>

09:15.597 --> 09:16.713
because he might get exposed

09:16.931 --> 09:19.298
to some kind of bacteria
or virus.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.474
So he's got a phobia?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.643
It's not a phobia
if the threat is real.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.600
You're a doctor,
you should know that.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.734
Sheldon, you have
nothing to worry about.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.651
Even if you did get the flu,

09:31.863 --> 09:33.399
it's usually over in a week.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.112
Why are we getting medical
advice from a man who smokes?

09:37.327 --> 09:38.568
<i>Sheldon.
O-Okay,</i>

09:38.787 --> 09:41.245
I have patients
who are actually sick.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.323
Maybe we should wrap this up.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.703
How come you don't
get sick all the time?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.410
Well, I take precautions.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.463
I wash my hands,
I wear gloves and a mask.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.351
So, Mom, how was your day?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.184
We're ignoring this?

10:09.484 --> 10:10.645
Okay.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.527
So pretty.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.784
What's going on?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.449
I'm not feeling so good.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.328
Biohazard! Biohazard!

10:31.172 --> 10:32.253
Sucker.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.585
In national news,

10:34.801 --> 10:38.636
<i>an unusually early flu season
is buffeting the country.</i>

10:38.847 --> 10:41.760
<i>Doctors say the strain,
originating in China,</i>

10:41.975 --> 10:44.137
<i>is particularly severe.</i>

10:44.352 --> 10:48.642
<i>Children and the elderly
are most at risk.</i>

10:48.857 --> 10:51.019
Sheldon, why are
you still up?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.021
We're all gonna die!

10:53.236 --> 10:54.317
<i>...about the local cattle...</i>

10:54.529 --> 10:55.440
This isn't funny!

10:55.655 --> 10:58.272
I know, baby, I know.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.571
But you need to
understand that sometimes

11:01.786 --> 11:04.153
the news says those things
just to scare people.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.825
Well, it's working!

11:06.040 --> 11:06.746
Come here.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.369
I know you don't
believe in this,

11:08.585 --> 11:10.326
but I'm gonna
do it anyway.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.960
Lord, I pray for
my son Sheldon

11:15.175 --> 11:18.043
that you protect him from
all illness and disease,

11:18.386 --> 11:20.844
and keep him healthy
and keep him safe,

11:21.055 --> 11:23.763
and protect him from
his head to his toes,

11:23.975 --> 11:26.388
inside and out. Amen.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.930
You're right.
I don't believe in that.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.352
But it did feel good. Thanks.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.735
In the Bible, that's called
a hedge of protection.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.947
Why do you keep smiling?

11:44.162 --> 11:46.245
You need to look
at your mask, baby.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.870
<i>Missy?!</i>

11:54.380 --> 11:55.996
We have to go to school,
and Sheldon doesn't?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.832
- That's not fair.
<i>- Sure it is.</i>

11:58.051 --> 11:59.883
Sheldon loves school
and can't go.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.211
You hate school
and have to. Fair.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.046
<i>He still has</i>

12:04.265 --> 12:05.551
to spend his day doing chores.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.508
Can't sit around
playing with his trains.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.969
Yeah, put him to work.
Good parenting, Dad.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.554
Oh, I'm glad you approve.

12:11.773 --> 12:12.684
I do.

12:14.776 --> 12:15.562
Where you going?

12:16.152 --> 12:17.643
I'm gonna give Sheldon
a list of chores.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.729
You're actually
taking my advice?

12:19.989 --> 12:20.729
Yes.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.065
Well, how about that?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.692
Hey, you were due.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.321
Proud of you, George.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.254
Sheldon?

12:39.259 --> 12:39.999
<i>Yes.</i>

12:40.343 --> 12:42.130
The door's locked.
Can you open it?

12:43.513 --> 12:44.503
No.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.634
What on earth?

12:58.319 --> 12:59.901
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

13:00.363 --> 13:02.901
I made a real germ-proof
hedge of protection.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.779
Oh, honey,
you can't stay in there.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.907
I've got a refrigerator,
I've got my sleeping bag,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.705
and anything else I need
I can make out of Legos.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.496
What's with
the Halloween costume?

13:17.463 --> 13:19.500
In case of a breach.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.757
Stay right there.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.130
That's my plan.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.381
George?

13:31.269 --> 13:32.476
Just when you think
he's gonna zig,

13:32.687 --> 13:34.269
you get
a big old zag.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.437
It's ridiculous. I'm...
I'm gonna take it down.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.811
No, you can't force him out
of a phobia.

13:39.110 --> 13:39.725
<i>What do we do?</i>

13:39.944 --> 13:40.775
He can't live
in there.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.319
Well, actually, he can.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.396
He's got the refrigerator
and a sleeping bag.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.777
And he can always
go potty in the sink.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.909
I think I'll take
the kids to school.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.280
I'm sure he'll be out
by the time you get home.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.831
Not sure why you
think that, but okay.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.034
- Mom?
- Yes, Shelly.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.334
Can you close the door?

13:58.546 --> 14:00.378
I need to use the sink.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.670
- Tammy Cook?
<i>- Here.</i>

14:08.890 --> 14:11.177
<i>- Georgie Cooper?</i>
- Here.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.805
Sheldon Cooper? Absent.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.261
- Where's your brother?
- Home.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.346
Is he okay?

14:17.565 --> 14:18.351
Yeah, he's just...

14:19.817 --> 14:22.605
Actually, it's not
looking good for him.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.186
He might not make it.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.022
- Oh, that's terrible.
- I know.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.070
I love him so much.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.079
If anything ever happened,
I don't know what I'd do.

14:33.748 --> 14:34.613
Aw.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.038
<i>Shelly, if you don't mind</i>

14:43.257 --> 14:46.091
- me asking, what's your long-term plan here?
- I'm working

14:46.302 --> 14:47.838
on the math to turn the garage

14:48.054 --> 14:50.171
into a self-sustaining
ecosystem.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.882
- Okay. And what exactly does that mean? <i>
- Well, all I need</i>

14:53.101 --> 14:55.764
is sunlight and a few seeds
to grow unlimited food

14:55.978 --> 14:58.311
which I'll fertilize
with my own feces.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.560
This just gets better.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.562
If you're not gonna
help, please go inside.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.234
This is not a show.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.437
Now that's where I disagree.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.948
Shelly, baby,
please come on out.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.407
I can't.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.201
Come on.
I'm your mommy.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.870
Do it for your mommy.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.071
No.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.581
But I'm your mommy.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.580
Y'all are killing me.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.921
<i>"I'm your mommy."</i>

15:25.133 --> 15:29.377
I think the saddest part
about it is just how sad it is.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.461
Is there anything
that we can do?

15:32.390 --> 15:33.471
I don't know.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.303
A hug might help.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.892
Of course.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.096
What's wrong
with you two?

15:40.314 --> 15:41.725
Don't you care
about my brother?

15:48.614 --> 15:49.821
Aw.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.613
Oh, Sheldon.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.569
That's it. I've had
enough of this nonsense.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.996
If you don't come out,
I'm coming in!

15:58.458 --> 16:00.620
One, two,

16:00.835 --> 16:02.667
- three.
- Breach! Breach!

16:02.879 --> 16:05.917
- You come here right this instant!
- No.

16:06.132 --> 16:06.918
Oh!

16:14.557 --> 16:16.173
You can't run away
from me forever.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.805
I don't have to do it forever.
Just till you get tired.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.101
<i>Mary,</i>

16:20.313 --> 16:21.599
I'm gonna run
and go get my video camera.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.055
Don't catch him till I get back.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.515
This is not a joke!

16:24.734 --> 16:26.350
Sheldon, get over here!

16:31.282 --> 16:34.446
Sheldon Lee Cooper, get here.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.366
<i>Right now.</i>

16:35.578 --> 16:38.321
Oh, Lord, I think
I'm gonna wet myself.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.872
<i>Get! You come here!
Sheldon Lee Cooper!</i>

16:47.089 --> 16:48.546
Look at that.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.959
St. Mary drinking alcohol.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.344
God saw what just happened.
He gets it.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.557
Mind if I take a crack
at catching the Road Runner?

16:58.768 --> 17:00.680
What are you gonna do
that I couldn't do?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.136
Oh, a little trick I learned

17:02.355 --> 17:04.311
trying to get prairie dogs
out of the hole.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.147
Of course we'd whack off
their heads with a golf club.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.393
I'm not gonna do that
to Sheldon.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.690
Oh, Moon Pie,

17:15.576 --> 17:18.660
I've got a little treat for you.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.661
Chocolate chip?

17:20.873 --> 17:23.240
Mm-hmm, right out of the oven.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.208
Good. That means
they're sterile.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.206
Why don't you come on out here
and... have a couple?

17:30.800 --> 17:31.836
I can't do that.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.542
Okay, I tell you what.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.299
I'm gonna just put 'em
right out here,

17:36.639 --> 17:39.677
and you can come out
and get one when you're ready.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.802
How about that?
I'm gonna put 'em down

17:43.104 --> 17:44.891
<i>right... here.</i>

17:48.776 --> 17:49.937
Aah!

17:51.404 --> 17:52.565
Come on! Oh.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.531
Listen to me, buster.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.366
- Okay.
<i>- You are</i>

17:58.578 --> 18:00.035
a lot of things, Sheldon.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.614
You are cute, smart, hygienic.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.411
But most of all...

18:10.006 --> 18:13.340
you... are a Texan.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.586
So?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.043
<i>So Texans</i>

18:16.262 --> 18:18.629
aren't afraid of nothin'!

18:18.848 --> 18:20.885
Rattlesnakes, Indians,

18:21.309 --> 18:23.016
<i>the Mexican Army.</i>

18:25.813 --> 18:30.057
Do you imagine that Sam Houston
was scared of a little old cold?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.312
No.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.269
Jim Bowie?

18:33.487 --> 18:34.603
No.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.697
Sissy Spacek?

18:38.826 --> 18:39.987
I... guess not?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.823
You're damn right,
because they're Texans

18:43.080 --> 18:44.116
through and through.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.790
Now I want you to quit hiding
in this plastic bubble,

18:47.001 --> 18:48.458
<i>and I want you to
come out here and</i>

18:48.669 --> 18:51.833
eat your cookies
out in the world like a man!

18:52.048 --> 18:53.334
Like a <i>Texan</i> man!

19:15.196 --> 19:16.653
I'm impressed.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.104
Me, too.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.282
I thought I'd lost him
at Sissy Spacek.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.240
Whew!

19:28.876 --> 19:29.912
<i>As you can see,</i>

19:30.127 --> 19:33.461
<i>my meemaw successfully
lured me back into the world</i>

19:33.673 --> 19:37.542
<i>by reminding me
of my brave Texas ancestors.</i>

19:37.760 --> 19:39.968
<i>Their blood ran
through my veins.</i>

19:40.179 --> 19:43.672
<i>I was a true son
of the Lone Star State.</i>

19:43.891 --> 19:45.553
<i>Albeit a true son</i>

19:45.768 --> 19:48.556
<i>with an incredibly fragile
immune system.</i>

19:48.771 --> 19:52.105
<i>I woke up the next morning
with a temperature of 102</i>

19:52.316 --> 19:54.933
<i>and a head packed full
of mucus.</i>

19:55.361 --> 19:58.945
<i>However, there was
a silver lining.</i>

20:13.337 --> 20:14.498
Sing it again, Mom.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.921
First, blow your nose.
