<b><i>I must crush his will.</i></b>

00:04.580 --> 00:07.970
<b><i>His will to fight, his will to stand,</i></b>

00:07.970 --> 00:09.440
<b><i>his will to resist...</i></b>

00:11.860 --> 00:19.710
<b><i>Let me demonstrate that all your hard 
work and confidence mean nothing!</i></b>

01:39.990 --> 01:45.040
<b>Victor x And x Loser</b>

02:01.820 --> 02:02.640
<b><i>He's fast...</i></b>

02:03.130 --> 02:05.390
<b><i>I had no time to dodge!</i></b>

02:07.300 --> 02:09.670
<b><i>But I can still block his attacks!</i></b>

02:10.450 --> 02:12.690
<b><i>Oh? He used </i>Gyo?</b>

02:13.480 --> 02:15.600
<b><i>The moment I grasped his arm,</i></b>

02:15.600 --> 02:18.450
<b><i>he focused his aura there to block my attack.</i></b>

02:19.950 --> 02:21.050
<b><i>Idiot!</i></b>

02:21.050 --> 02:24.080
<b><i>You think you've outwitted me now?!</i></b>

02:34.370 --> 02:35.920
<b>What's the matter?</b>

02:35.920 --> 02:37.970
<b>That was just a body blow.</b>

02:38.580 --> 02:41.170
<b>If you focus your aura where I grab you,</b>

02:41.170 --> 02:43.970
<b>you leave yourself open everywhere else.</b>

02:43.970 --> 02:45.300
<b>It's futile...</b>

02:45.300 --> 02:49.250
<b>In fact, you're only making 
it harder on yourself.</b>

02:54.260 --> 02:56.110
<b><i>Bisky was right!</i></b>

02:58.670 --> 03:00.740
<b>You won't be smiling much longer!</b>

03:06.510 --> 03:09.400
<b><i>One more hit to send you to hell!</i></b>

03:15.450 --> 03:16.490
<b><i>Impossible!</i></b>

03:16.490 --> 03:18.180
<b><i>That was the hardest hit so far!</i></b>

03:18.180 --> 03:19.920
<b><i>He shouldn't have been able to counter.</i></b>

03:20.470 --> 03:24.680
<b><i>But since he did, that means he 
kept the damage to a minimum.</i></b>

03:24.800 --> 03:29.730
<b><i>In other words, he blocked me 
without relying on aura.</i></b>

03:30.320 --> 03:33.250
<b><i>He guessed I didn't intend to set off a bomb?</i></b>

03:34.640 --> 03:36.770
<b><i>No, that wasn't a guess.</i></b>

03:38.030 --> 03:39.490
<b><i>Hey, Bisky...</i></b>

03:39.490 --> 03:43.030
<b><i>How does Genthru avoid being 
burned by his own bombs?</i></b>

03:44.110 --> 03:45.580
<b><i>That's quite simple.</i></b>

03:45.580 --> 03:50.700
<b><i>He shrouds his hand in aura that's 
stronger than the explosion.</i></b>

03:50.700 --> 03:52.290
<b><i>Oh... I get it.</i></b>

03:52.730 --> 03:56.290
<b><i>It's a technique that requires 
a large aura reserve.</i></b>

03:57.580 --> 03:59.530
<b><i>This is a good opportunity.</i></b>

03:59.530 --> 04:01.300
<b><i>By now, you should be able to tell.</i></b>

04:04.190 --> 04:05.600
<b><i>Excellent reaction!</i></b>

04:05.600 --> 04:07.790
<b><i>You've almost perfected </i>Gyo.</b>

04:07.790 --> 04:09.560
<b><i>One more time, then.</i></b>

04:10.870 --> 04:11.760
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

04:11.760 --> 04:13.250
<b><i>Could you tell the difference?</i></b>

04:13.250 --> 04:17.040
<b><i>Yeah, you used less aura the second time.</i></b>

04:17.430 --> 04:19.330
<b><i>Okay, you pass.</i></b>

04:19.330 --> 04:23.820
<b><i>You'll have an easier time with him 
if you can tell the difference.</i></b>

04:24.580 --> 04:29.130
<b><i>When Genthru prepares Little Flower, 
he will shroud his hand with </i>Gyo.</b>

04:29.130 --> 04:33.780
<b><i>If he's just faking and planning 
to attack you somewhere else,</i></b>

04:33.780 --> 04:35.970
<b><i>he probably won't use</i> Gyo.</b>

04:37.030 --> 04:41.050
<b><i>If you can tell if his hand is covered 
with</i> Gyo <i>when he grabs you,</i></b>

04:41.460 --> 04:45.840
<b><i>it'll be simpler for you to know 
which attack you should block.</i></b>

04:47.290 --> 04:48.220
<b>So that's it.</b>

04:48.910 --> 04:50.560
<b>You knew from my <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

04:50.560 --> 04:51.850
<b>Cunning.</b>

04:54.770 --> 04:56.350
<b>Let me repeat myself.</b>

04:57.000 --> 05:00.640
<b>The shallow strategy you're using will backfire.</b>

05:00.640 --> 05:05.450
<b>If you're caught by Little Flower when 
you aren't using enough aura to defend,</b>

05:05.880 --> 05:10.870
<b>a hit to the face will blow off your eyes, 
nose, and mouth with no hope of repair.</b>

05:11.310 --> 05:16.760
<b>A hit to the arms or legs will incinerate skin, 
severely damaging any nerves or muscle.</b>

05:17.150 --> 05:19.780
<b>You'll have no fingers or toes left.</b>

05:20.670 --> 05:25.510
<b>It's not possible for you to use <i>Gyo</i> to guard 
against every attack that uses <i>Gyo</i>.</b>

05:26.360 --> 05:27.130
<b>Now what?</b>

05:28.320 --> 05:30.850
<b>I'm not interested in continuing this.</b>

05:30.850 --> 05:33.270
<b>Fighting you has made me see something...</b>

05:33.610 --> 05:36.810
<b>You have talent and a promising future.</b>

05:36.810 --> 05:38.520
<b>And many other chances.</b>

05:39.180 --> 05:44.000
<b>Don't you think it's meaningless to throw 
all that away just for your pride?</b>

05:44.700 --> 05:47.530
<b><i>Just give up, stupid kid!</i></b>

05:48.810 --> 05:52.830
<b><i>If he makes like he's going to use 
both hands to blow you up,</i></b>

05:52.830 --> 05:54.390
<b><i>that's a red light.</i></b>

05:54.390 --> 05:57.410
<b><i>Then it'll be time to stick to the plan.</i></b>

05:58.180 --> 06:00.920
<b><i>Sorry, Bisky and Killua.</i></b>

06:01.380 --> 06:04.140
<b><i>I'm gonna be selfish here.</i></b>

06:04.140 --> 06:06.280
<b><i>I have to give it a try...</i></b>

06:06.620 --> 06:09.490
<b><i>Because I just had a great idea!</i></b>

06:10.900 --> 06:13.430
<b>If you seriously mean that,</b>

06:14.500 --> 06:16.810
<b>you should surrender, Genthru!</b>

06:19.490 --> 06:20.720
<b>A shame...</b>

06:24.690 --> 06:25.820
<b>Let me show you</b>

06:26.480 --> 06:31.240
<b>that there are some things worse than death.</b>

06:32.710 --> 06:35.280
<b>I'll blow up both your arms.</b>

06:35.280 --> 06:38.260
<b>Use <i>Gyo</i> to protect the one you want to keep.</b>

06:38.260 --> 06:42.580
<b>After that, I'll blow up your 
remaining arm and left leg.</b>

06:42.580 --> 06:45.020
<b>Use <i>Gyo</i> to protect the one you want to keep.</b>

06:45.020 --> 06:47.590
<b>And so on...</b>

06:47.590 --> 06:49.980
<b>Until you're out of limbs.</b>

06:49.980 --> 06:51.930
<b>Go ahead and try!</b>

06:52.500 --> 06:53.520
<b>Very well.</b>

06:57.360 --> 06:58.180
<b>Take this!</b>

07:07.710 --> 07:10.510
<b><i>Wh-What happened?</i></b>

07:15.590 --> 07:16.490
<b><i>Blood?</i></b>

07:17.430 --> 07:18.390
<b><i>Damage?</i></b>

07:18.880 --> 07:20.680
<b><i>He landed a hit?</i></b>

07:21.550 --> 07:23.930
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

07:25.140 --> 07:25.880
<b><i>Crap...</i></b>

07:26.460 --> 07:28.260
<b><i>Move... Dodge!</i></b>

07:28.550 --> 07:29.380
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

07:30.220 --> 07:30.880
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

07:32.220 --> 07:34.210
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

07:41.000 --> 07:42.480
<b><i>Did he hit me?</i></b>

07:42.820 --> 07:44.950
<b><i>No, I tripped.</i></b>

07:46.080 --> 07:48.030
<b><i>What was that?</i></b>

07:48.030 --> 07:49.460
<b><i>What just happened?</i></b>

07:52.480 --> 07:53.780
<b><i>Now I understand...</i></b>

07:54.620 --> 07:56.870
<b><i>Th-This kid...</i></b>

07:57.260 --> 07:59.180
<b><i>He sacrificed both hands!</i></b>

08:02.060 --> 08:05.830
<b><i>But the damage wasn't distributed evenly!</i></b>

08:06.510 --> 08:08.820
<b><i>He probably gave up completely on his left hand,</i></b>

08:08.820 --> 08:11.860
<b><i>protected his right hand with 30% of his aura,</i></b>

08:11.860 --> 08:15.520
<b><i>and focused the remaining 70% on his legs...</i></b>

08:17.010 --> 08:19.030
<b><i>to attack me!</i></b>

08:20.060 --> 08:23.900
<b><i>I use aura both to explode targets and 
to shield my hand from the blast.</i></b>

08:24.380 --> 08:27.000
<b><i>If I use it on both hands,</i></b>

08:27.000 --> 08:30.080
<b><i>I won't have much left for the rest of myself.</i></b>

08:30.080 --> 08:31.490
<b><i>He took advantage of that!</i></b>

08:32.060 --> 08:36.120
<b><i>Still, no one sane would actually try that!</i></b>

08:37.040 --> 08:40.130
<b><i>I gave him a pretty good scare!</i></b>

08:43.380 --> 08:44.940
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

08:45.330 --> 08:47.030
<b><i>This hurts like hell.</i></b>

08:47.630 --> 08:48.480
<b><i>But...</i></b>

08:49.670 --> 08:50.630
<b><i>I'm going for it!</i></b>

08:53.020 --> 08:54.630
<b>I'm done...</b>

08:55.640 --> 08:56.800
<b><i>He's done?</i></b>

08:56.800 --> 08:57.890
<b><i>Is he giving up?</i></b>

08:58.660 --> 08:59.950
<b><i>Of course...</i></b>

08:59.950 --> 09:01.640
<b><i>That makes sense.</i></b>

09:01.640 --> 09:04.720
<b><i>He's lost his left hand, 
and his right is badly injured.</i></b>

09:05.020 --> 09:08.050
<b><i>And he managed to land a hit on me.</i></b>

09:08.050 --> 09:10.520
<b><i>He must be satisfied now.</i></b>

09:10.850 --> 09:13.030
<b>I'm done being selfish...</b>

09:14.330 --> 09:15.900
<b>Time to get serious!</b>

09:16.730 --> 09:18.780
<b>Let's do this, Genthru!</b>

09:20.070 --> 09:22.290
<b><i>Th-This kid's</i></b>

09:23.080 --> 09:24.620
<b><i>totally insane!</i></b>

09:30.560 --> 09:31.440
<b><i>Book!</i></b>

09:34.360 --> 09:35.320
<b><i>A card?</i></b>

09:35.810 --> 09:37.860
<b><i>He shouldn't have anything to concern me.</i></b>

09:39.590 --> 09:41.200
<b><i>The card transformed?</i></b>

09:41.490 --> 09:43.090
<b><i>Paladin's Necklace?!</i></b>

09:43.740 --> 09:45.270
<b><i>What is he planning?</i></b>

09:46.190 --> 09:48.400
<b>This is your last chance to surrender.</b>

09:49.250 --> 09:53.810
<b>Once I use this, you could end up dead.</b>

09:54.130 --> 09:56.150
<b>You're clearly bluffing!</b>

09:56.690 --> 09:57.910
<b><i>Now wait...</i></b>

09:57.910 --> 09:59.660
<b><i>This is my chance.</i></b>

09:59.980 --> 10:00.950
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

10:01.890 --> 10:03.120
<b>I give up.</b>

10:03.480 --> 10:07.160
<b>Obviously, you're never going to surrender.</b>

10:07.540 --> 10:08.670
<b>Take them.</b>

10:10.740 --> 10:12.600
<b><i>I'll silence him.</i></b>

10:12.890 --> 10:15.420
<b><i>Crushing his windpipe and 
knocking him out would be best.</i></b>

10:16.030 --> 10:19.180
<b><i>Then I can take the cards from his binder.</i></b>

10:19.660 --> 10:21.440
<b>I have one request.</b>

10:21.740 --> 10:22.660
<b>What is it?</b>

10:22.660 --> 10:25.780
<b>Could you leave me this card?</b>

10:32.130 --> 10:32.690
<b><i>Bah...</i></b>

10:33.160 --> 10:35.440
<b><i>He blocked my second attack with </i>Gyo<i>!</i></b>

10:35.810 --> 10:38.080
<b><i>But I did manage to crush his windpipe!</i></b>

10:38.080 --> 10:42.010
<b><i>He won't be able to use Book or Gain anymore.</i></b>

10:44.210 --> 10:45.570
<b><i>Genthru...</i></b>

10:45.570 --> 10:49.080
<b><i>You have made the worst mistake you could make.</i></b>

10:49.790 --> 10:50.830
<b>Gasoline 

A glass container 
filled with fuel. 
Highly flammable.</b>

10:51.710 --> 10:52.580
<b><i>One minute!</i></b>

10:57.900 --> 10:59.090
<b><i>What's that smell?</i></b>

11:02.250 --> 11:04.850
<b><i>He can't use Little Flower any longer.</i></b>

11:05.850 --> 11:07.600
<b><i>I'm going to take him down!</i></b>

11:07.890 --> 11:08.430
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

11:10.940 --> 11:13.330
<b>Oh, so this is gasoline...</b>

11:13.330 --> 11:14.610
<b>Very clever.</b>

11:14.980 --> 11:17.900
<b>True, I cannot use Little Flower now...</b>

11:17.900 --> 11:20.360
<b>However, I have another ability,</b>

11:20.900 --> 11:22.990
<b>Countdown.</b>

11:23.630 --> 11:26.830
<b>The ability that lets me set a bomb</b>

11:26.830 --> 11:30.500
<b>when I touch someone and say "Bomber."</b>

11:31.060 --> 11:34.990
<b>The bomb can only be disarmed 
by touching me and saying,</b>

11:34.990 --> 11:37.500
<b>"I caught the Bomber."</b>

11:38.130 --> 11:41.160
<b>This one is ten times stronger than Little Flower.</b>

11:41.160 --> 11:44.100
<b>You won't be able to block it with <i>Nen</i>.</b>

11:44.750 --> 11:47.450
<b>All the activation requirements have been met.</b>

11:48.090 --> 11:52.520
<b>If I touch you and say, "Bomber," 
the countdown will begin.</b>

11:53.100 --> 11:54.920
<b>Try to run away...</b>

11:54.920 --> 11:57.020
<b>If you still have the strength.</b>

11:57.470 --> 12:00.650
<b><i>The requirements have been met... for me!</i></b>

12:01.930 --> 12:04.160
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

12:05.690 --> 12:07.580
<b><i>This is his earlier attack...</i></b>

12:07.970 --> 12:09.660
<b><i>If get too close, I'm done for.</i></b>

12:10.380 --> 12:11.910
<b><i>Is he trying to keep me back?</i></b>

12:12.350 --> 12:13.330
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

12:13.830 --> 12:14.800
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

12:15.630 --> 12:18.530
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

12:25.800 --> 12:26.760
<b><i>A pitfall?</i></b>

12:27.240 --> 12:29.850
<b><i>But he's falling with me!</i></b>

12:41.970 --> 12:42.860
<b><i>It's deep...</i></b>

12:43.280 --> 12:44.750
<b><i>I can't climb back up.</i></b>

12:44.750 --> 12:46.880
<b><i>But he should be in the same boat.</i></b>

12:46.880 --> 12:50.370
<b><i>He's ended up cornering himself.</i></b>

12:54.180 --> 12:55.000
<b><i>He's gone.</i></b>

12:56.260 --> 12:57.730
<b>Genthru...</b>

13:02.490 --> 13:05.380
<b><i>If a card is removed from 
the binder for a minute,</i></b>

13:05.380 --> 13:06.860
<b><i>it reverts to an item.</i></b>

13:08.320 --> 13:09.560
<b>Large Rock</b>

13:13.610 --> 13:14.890
<b>A rock?!</b>

13:34.060 --> 13:36.930
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

13:39.240 --> 13:40.780
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

13:40.780 --> 13:41.920
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

13:42.330 --> 13:43.760
<b>W-W-Wait!</b>

13:43.760 --> 13:46.510
<b>I surrender! I surrender!</b>

13:46.510 --> 13:49.590
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

14:03.370 --> 14:04.320
<b>Osu!</b>

14:13.670 --> 14:14.700
<b>Are you awake?</b>

14:15.300 --> 14:17.410
<b>Summon your binder.</b>

14:17.940 --> 14:21.150
<b>We want you to return the cards you stole</b>

14:21.150 --> 14:23.160
<b>from the people you backstabbed.</b>

14:23.780 --> 14:25.840
<b>On one condition...</b>

14:27.180 --> 14:30.840
<b>Use Archangel to heal Bara.</b>

14:31.970 --> 14:33.820
<b>We have a Clone card.</b>

14:34.440 --> 14:35.720
<b>Don't worry.</b>

14:36.430 --> 14:38.340
<b>That was always part of the plan.</b>

14:38.690 --> 14:42.610
<b>We brought six copies of Clone.</b>

14:46.890 --> 14:48.240
<b><i>Book...</i></b>

14:52.110 --> 14:52.840
<b><i>Gain!</i></b>

15:03.310 --> 15:05.880
<b>What is your wish?</b>

15:06.580 --> 15:10.630
<b>We need you to heal his hands and throat.</b>

15:11.010 --> 15:13.640
<b>Actually, can you just heal all his injuries?</b>

15:14.200 --> 15:15.970
<b>Easily done.</b>

15:15.970 --> 15:19.890
<b>Then I shall heal his body.</b>

15:33.370 --> 15:35.250
<b>I'm healed!</b>

15:35.250 --> 15:36.920
<b>Then, farewell.</b>

15:36.920 --> 15:38.860
<b>All right!</b>

15:40.230 --> 15:43.540
<b>Okay, here's the extra Archangel.</b>

15:47.060 --> 15:47.960
<b><i>Gain!</i></b>

15:55.100 --> 15:56.670
<b>Next up is Killua.</b>

15:57.420 --> 16:00.650
<b>Genthru, we're going to use your binder.</b>

16:01.150 --> 16:02.560
<b>Go ahead.</b>

16:03.200 --> 16:04.640
<b><i>Clone on!</i></b>

16:05.600 --> 16:09.510
<b>Breath of Archangel has reached 
its maximum card limit.</b>

16:09.510 --> 16:11.200
<b>Clone will be destroyed.</b>

16:13.810 --> 16:15.290
<b>W-W-Wait!</b>

16:15.290 --> 16:16.420
<b>What's going on?!</b>

16:16.420 --> 16:17.960
<b>Did I do something wrong?</b>

16:17.960 --> 16:19.790
<b>No, it's Goreinu.</b>

16:19.790 --> 16:20.450
<b>Huh?</b>

16:20.980 --> 16:25.270
<b>He used Clone or Transform to increase the 
number of Breath of Archangel vouchers.</b>

16:25.950 --> 16:29.960
<b>So two of his vouchers became 
Breath of Archangel cards.</b>

16:32.380 --> 16:36.290
<b>Another player has used Contact to reach you.</b>

16:36.780 --> 16:38.660
<b>Yo, it's Goreinu.</b>

16:39.100 --> 16:40.980
<b>Looks like you won.</b>

16:43.060 --> 16:44.480
<b>But I don't approve of this.</b>

16:45.490 --> 16:48.770
<b>If you plan to use Breath of Archangel 
to heal these murderers,</b>

16:48.770 --> 16:50.230
<b>the trade is off!</b>

16:50.660 --> 16:51.890
<b>You okay with using it on me?</b>

16:51.890 --> 16:53.090
<b>Of course.</b>

16:53.820 --> 16:55.610
<b>I am an assassin.</b>

16:55.610 --> 16:56.550
<b>Eh?</b>

16:56.550 --> 16:58.870
<b>I've killed more people than these guys.</b>

16:59.780 --> 17:03.670
<b>Each player in this game risks their 
life in one way or another.</b>

17:04.110 --> 17:06.480
<b>That doesn't make it okay to kill others.</b>

17:06.870 --> 17:11.870
<b>But all the people I've killed were 
not nearly as prepared to die.</b>

17:12.500 --> 17:14.510
<b>I'm worse than these guys.</b>

17:15.040 --> 17:17.810
<b>No, you aren't like them.</b>

17:18.180 --> 17:21.800
<b>I like you, but I hate their guts!</b>

17:21.800 --> 17:23.670
<b>That isn't a valid reason!</b>

17:23.670 --> 17:24.910
<b>I don't need a reason...</b>

17:24.910 --> 17:26.270
<b>What counts is how I feel.</b>

17:26.800 --> 17:28.480
<b>Aren't you guys the same way?</b>

17:28.810 --> 17:30.770
<b>But we don't think it's right</b>

17:30.770 --> 17:34.130
<b>to let them die because we hate them.</b>

17:35.120 --> 17:37.630
<b>In battle, both sides risk their lives,</b>

17:37.630 --> 17:40.240
<b>and are prepared to kill.</b>

17:40.870 --> 17:44.660
<b>But that doesn't apply once the fight is over.</b>

17:44.960 --> 17:50.040
<b>I haven't forgiven Genthru for 
killing all those players...</b>

17:50.400 --> 17:53.900
<b>But the three of us agreed before the fight</b>

17:53.900 --> 17:56.430
<b>that we'd bring six Clone cards.</b>

17:57.300 --> 18:00.550
<b>I don't really remember why we decided that,</b>

18:01.180 --> 18:03.810
<b>but it wasn't based on logic or reason.</b>

18:04.740 --> 18:07.060
<b>It was just the decision that came naturally to us.</b>

18:07.480 --> 18:11.160
<b>Once the fight was over and we'd 
obtained Breath of Archangel,</b>

18:11.160 --> 18:13.570
<b>we planned to heal everyone.</b>

18:14.180 --> 18:17.710
<b>All three of us made the decision, 
so we wanted to stick to it.</b>

18:18.440 --> 18:21.830
<b>But I understand how you feel, 
and we can't change your mind.</b>

18:22.450 --> 18:23.700
<b>Sorry, Killua...</b>

18:24.350 --> 18:26.250
<b>Could you wait a little longer?</b>

18:26.690 --> 18:28.050
<b>No problem.</b>

18:28.050 --> 18:30.080
<b>I'll recover on my own in a while.</b>

18:34.260 --> 18:37.330
<b>The situation's changed, so we 
can't use Clone anymore.</b>

18:37.700 --> 18:40.030
<b>There's only one Breath of Archangel left.</b>

18:40.330 --> 18:43.720
<b>Only one? Isn't that the original?</b>

18:44.680 --> 18:46.600
<b>Use it on Genthru.</b>

18:47.610 --> 18:49.170
<b>I'm fine...</b>

18:56.860 --> 18:59.860
<b>Okay, let's use Accompany to go to Masadora.</b>

19:00.200 --> 19:01.210
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:01.210 --> 19:02.740
<b>Hey, wait up...</b>

19:02.740 --> 19:06.250
<b>Fine, you can have Breath of Archangel.</b>

19:06.610 --> 19:07.220
<b>Huh?</b>

19:07.220 --> 19:09.210
<b>Really? Are you sure?</b>

19:09.210 --> 19:10.600
<b>Yeah, actually...</b>

19:10.600 --> 19:14.300
<b>Before you told me all this, 
I planned to give it to you.</b>

19:14.300 --> 19:17.630
<b>Not just Archangel, but all of our cards.</b>

19:17.630 --> 19:18.680
<b>What?!</b>

19:18.680 --> 19:22.390
<b>Tsezgerra, his team, and I all agreed.</b>

19:23.000 --> 19:25.700
<b>We've decided to give up on the game.</b>

19:29.640 --> 19:31.900
<b>Wow, I'm completely healed!</b>

19:32.770 --> 19:34.820
<b>Oh, so Mr. Battera...</b>

19:34.820 --> 19:38.900
<b>Yeah, he paid Tsezgerra and his 
team for breaking his promise.</b>

19:38.900 --> 19:40.770
<b>I got four billion out of it.</b>

19:40.770 --> 19:41.910
<b>Four billion?!</b>

19:41.910 --> 19:42.850
<b>Hey...</b>

19:42.850 --> 19:44.390
<b>Share some of the wealth!</b>

19:44.390 --> 19:45.920
<b>Wh-What are you talking about?</b>

19:45.920 --> 19:48.920
<b>Each of the four of us gets one billion!</b>

19:49.250 --> 19:50.500
<b>Eh?!</b>

19:50.880 --> 19:52.290
<b>It's only fair...</b>

19:52.290 --> 19:54.910
<b>I couldn't have done this on my own.</b>

19:54.910 --> 19:58.550
<b>It was only possible because 
I teamed up with you guys.</b>

19:59.360 --> 20:01.440
<b>I can't believe it...</b>

20:02.200 --> 20:04.800
<b>You're such a nice guy!</b>

20:05.160 --> 20:08.310
<b>Anyway, you can take all the cards.</b>

20:08.940 --> 20:10.930
<b>On one condition!</b>

20:10.930 --> 20:14.210
<b>You must be the first players to beat the game.</b>

20:14.210 --> 20:15.030
<b>Yep!</b>

20:15.030 --> 20:15.940
<b>Not a problem.</b>

20:16.520 --> 20:19.270
<b>That gives you ninety-nine restricted slot cards.</b>

20:19.680 --> 20:22.200
<b>Leaving only #0.</b>

20:22.730 --> 20:24.020
<b>One card to go...</b>

20:24.420 --> 20:25.330
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:27.530 --> 20:31.170
<b>Ninety-seven, ninety-eight...</b>

20:31.790 --> 20:33.190
<b>And this is...</b>

20:34.080 --> 20:36.340

21:21.480 --> 21:24.440
<b>Questions about restricted slot cards, huh?</b>

21:24.440 --> 21:25.880
<b>I get it.</b>

21:26.460 --> 21:29.530
<b>The questions are probably 
designed so that players</b>

21:29.530 --> 21:32.020
<b>who mainly stole cards can't answer them.</b>

21:34.480 --> 21:35.370
<b>Someone's coming!</b>
