09:20.560 --> 09:22.646
(button clicks)

09:22.688 --> 09:24.523
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.524
What are you still doing here?

09:25.565 --> 09:26.483
Altering leather,

09:26.525 --> 09:27.818
the bane of my existence.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.236
What about you?

09:29.278 --> 09:32.781
I'm working on a freelance video
I got roped into doing.

09:32.823 --> 09:34.366
-Is that the country club?
-Yeah.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.286
What?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.204
I'm trying to imagine you
as a tennis pro.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.664
Assistant pro.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.874
Do you have to wear
a cute little uniform?

09:42.916 --> 09:45.043
It's just tennis whites,
but the shirt was embroidered

09:45.085 --> 09:46.878
with a Red Oaks insignia.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.089
I'll pay you ten bucks if you
wear it to work tomorrow.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.132
(laughs)
No way.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.884
$20 if you wear the shorts, too.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.428
It's never gonna happen.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.804
You're no fun.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.055
Hey, show me more.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.890
Get out of here, go have a life.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.851
No, I'm serious,
I've always been curious

10:00.892 --> 10:03.979
about what goes on
in the wilds of New Jersey.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.898
(sighs)
Pull up a chair.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.780
(knocks on door)

10:13.822 --> 10:17.492
(classical music playing)

10:17.534 --> 10:20.996
Wheeler, so glad you made it.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.914
-Oh, please, come in.
-Okay.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.168
Um, I-I didn't really
know what to bring, so...

10:26.209 --> 10:28.587
Oh, uh... so thoughtful,
thank you.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.422
Um, here, come this way.
Meet my husband.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.591
-Oh.
-(clears throat)

10:32.632 --> 10:35.927
You must be Wheeler.
(laughing)

10:35.969 --> 10:37.637
Cecil Fox.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.599
Bee's told me so much about you.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.059
Uh, who's Bee?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.894
Cecil's little pet name for me.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.021
Because she's my queen
and packs a wicked sting.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.482
-Cecil, please.
-Um, I'm sorry, am I early?

10:48.523 --> 10:50.192
Oh, not at all.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.568
Uh, why don't you get something
to drink for Mr. Wheeler?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.070
Oh, of course, my pet.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.865
I'm sure the others
will be here any moment.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.494
(glassware clanking)

11:00.535 --> 11:03.580
That's quite an impressive
head of hair you have there.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.540
Well, you should have seen me
as a baby.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.667
I was like a little ham
with an afro.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.878
CECIL:
Red or white?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.463
-Excuse me?
-Wine?

11:11.505 --> 11:13.465
Oh, no, water's fine.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.717
A teetotaler.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.220
I don't know, maybe. Uh...

11:18.261 --> 11:20.389
-No, I don't think so.
-Recovering alcoholic?

11:20.430 --> 11:22.349
No, I just like water.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.351
Uh, no need to explain.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.311
Your body is your temple.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.730
-Well, mine's more like
a Jiffy Lube. -(laughs)

11:28.772 --> 11:32.234
I can tell we're going
to get along swimmingly.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.902
Cool.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.447
GETTY (over TV):
Hello, I'm Doug Getty.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.408
-Many of you know me...
-DAVID: Holy shit.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.118
-Where'd you find those?
-Mini fridge in wardrobe.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.537
-It's our secret stash.
-Nice.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.622
-Any sesame chicken left?
-Mm-hmm.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.836
So, uh, what's Noah
up to tonight?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.045
Work dinner.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.880
Mm. Sounds fun.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.465
Not really.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.592
He hates them. Says the last
thing he wants to do

11:57.634 --> 11:59.386
is socialize
with a bunch of lawyers.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.804
But he is a lawyer.

12:00.846 --> 12:04.182
Who secretly wishes
he was a track coach.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.268
How'd you guys meet?

12:06.309 --> 12:08.645
Track team.

12:08.687 --> 12:09.980
High school sweethearts?

12:10.021 --> 12:11.565
That's so wholesome.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.108
-Don't make fun.
-I'm joking.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.609
Who's that?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.445
DAVID:
Getty.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.655
Wait, your ex's father?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.115
The guy in jail?

12:20.157 --> 12:21.616
-The one and only.
-(button clicks)

12:21.658 --> 12:22.826
-Is the hair okay? -DAVID
(over TV): Yeah, it looks fine.

12:22.868 --> 12:23.910
Look...
(sniffles)

12:23.952 --> 12:27.038
-Talk right in?
-DAVID (over TV): Yeah.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.415
(clears throat)
You sure?

12:28.457 --> 12:30.625
Just make sure
I don't look jowly.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.712
That's what fucked Nixon.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.631
ANNABELLE (chuckles):
He doesn't look so scary.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.885
Hey.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.179
You okay?

12:42.220 --> 12:43.597
GETTY:
I'm Doug Getty.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.931
-Oh, yeah.
-Many of you know me...

12:44.973 --> 12:46.266
-I'm just thinking.
-(button clicks)

12:46.308 --> 12:47.642
What about?

12:47.684 --> 12:49.561
Think Derek's ever gonna
watch my reel?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.771
It's been sitting on his desk
for two weeks.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.441
-Not anymore.
-What?

12:54.483 --> 12:56.610
-He took it home.
-How do you know?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.487
Because when I was in his office
earlier today,

12:58.528 --> 13:00.030
I snuck it into his backpack.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.576
You're amazing.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.828
I know.
(laughs)

13:06.870 --> 13:08.997
Thank you.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.604
These pistachios are phenomenal.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.648
-Are you religious?
-Uh, not that it matters,

13:34.689 --> 13:36.441
of course, we're just curious.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.235
Uh, half-Jewish.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.778
CECIL:
Which half?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.196
From the waist down?

13:41.238 --> 13:42.822
(Cecil laughs)

13:42.864 --> 13:43.823
-That's funny.
-He's funny.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.242
I told you.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.370
Is it weird
that no one else is here yet?

13:48.411 --> 13:49.913
Well, I'm afraid Bee and I

13:49.955 --> 13:52.207
haven't been entirely
forthright with you.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.416
No one else is coming, Wheeler.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.418
CECIL:
It's just you.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.462
I don't understand. Why me?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.673
CECIL: Because we want
to talk to you about something.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.049
FOX:
A little project

14:01.091 --> 14:02.592
we're hoping
you might help us with.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.094
-Business venture,
you might say. -Not "business."

14:04.135 --> 14:05.595
Oh, sorry. Poor word choice.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.013
Continue.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.431
CECIL: The long
and the short of it is this.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.475
Bee and I very much
want to have a child,

14:10.517 --> 14:12.018
but we can't because, well...

14:12.060 --> 14:13.228
Cecil is sterile.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.604
It's true.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.065
My sperm just aren't
up to the task.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.025
Which is why we need yours.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.529
What?

14:22.571 --> 14:23.905
We'll pay you, of course.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.031
We were thinking
a hundred dollars.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.616
-$150.
-$150.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.993
-Per sample. -CECIL: Yeah, plus,
a thousand dollar bonus

14:28.034 --> 14:29.661
once Bee's pregnant.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.246
FOX: It's really quite
a simple procedure.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.540
Essentially, you use
a sort of turkey baster.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.166
Okay, I-I should go,
I've got so much homework.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.334
No, please, Wheeler,
Cecil and I are desperate.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.419
You'd make an excellent donor.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.753
You're clearly intelligent.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.963
We've looked up
your Cornell transcript

14:40.005 --> 14:42.257
and your GPA is most impressive.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.426
Of course, in a perfect world,
you'd be six inches taller,

14:44.467 --> 14:45.885
-perhaps a little less husky.
-Well, but that aside,

14:45.927 --> 14:47.596
don't do drugs.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.930
FOX: Aren't technically
a Columbia student,

14:48.972 --> 14:50.098
so there's no ethical issues.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.600
Don't run in our social circles.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.935
Okay, uh, I don't know.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.520
I-I just...

14:55.562 --> 14:57.314
-Don't answer yet.
-I-I really-- I'm sorry.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.607
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

14:58.648 --> 14:59.774
I just, I have to go.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.900
CECIL:
Think it over, you know?

15:00.942 --> 15:02.444
Take your time.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.696
But not too long,
because I ovulate next week.

15:08.033 --> 15:11.328
Well, I think we really planted
a seed today.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.787
(door closes)

15:12.829 --> 15:16.416
People always think sake
should be served warm.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.169
But connoisseurs know

15:19.210 --> 15:23.506
the primo stuff is best enjoyed
slightly chilled.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.095
Kanpai, gentlemen.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.847
Kanpai.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.724
Cheers, whatever.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.103
NASH:
Dear Lord, Skip,

15:37.145 --> 15:39.105
get a hold of yourself.
It's not Brass Monkey.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.982
BARRY:
Nasser-san is right.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.026
This is a civilized beverage.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.778
You need to treat it tenderly.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.447
Like a tit.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.657
Mmm.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.075
Fun fact.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.494
Sake is often referred
to as rice wine.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.789
But botanically speaking,
it's a beer.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.416
It tastes like
a flooded basement.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.503
Maybe to the unrefined palate
of a round-eye.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.383
How come you know so much
about Japan anyway?

16:08.093 --> 16:09.678
Because the Land
of the Rising Sun

16:09.719 --> 16:12.681
has always been
my spiritual home.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.100
I'm convinced
that in a past life,

16:15.141 --> 16:16.559
I was a shogun.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.103
Or maybe even a concubine.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.730
It's something I've always felt,

16:20.772 --> 16:22.315
deep in my chi.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.484
Even though
that's a Chinese concept.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.069
We're wasting our time, Nash.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.904
There is no way
that Getty is gonna let

16:27.946 --> 16:29.656
the Japanese buy Red Oaks.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.991
Pray you're right,
but I'm not taking any chances.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.994
I can't afford to be replaced
by a Japanese pro.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.540
If it means learning their ways,
then kanpai it is.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.543
Well, we got a shitload
to learn, shinshi.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.253
So let's get started.

16:43.294 --> 16:48.133
Now, first lesson: bowing.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.094
("Japanese Boy" by Aneka
playing)

16:54.055 --> 16:59.018
♪ Ah... ♪

17:02.021 --> 17:03.982
♪ He said that he loved me ♪

17:04.023 --> 17:06.943

17:06.985 --> 17:09.320

17:36.473 --> 17:37.682
Oh.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.228
(door closes)

17:45.774 --> 17:47.692
Boyfriend stand you up?

17:49.611 --> 17:51.237
Yeah, I don't know
what's keeping him.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.323
He was supposed to be here
20 minutes ago.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.657
You want a slice while you wait?

17:57.202 --> 17:59.746
Sure. Why not?

18:01.873 --> 18:04.250
Is this guy gonna mind us
eating pizza on his car?

18:04.292 --> 18:05.710
Oh, why don't you ask him?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.337
Seriously? This is yours?

18:07.378 --> 18:10.298
It's a birthday present
to myself when I turned 30.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.300
(chuckles)

18:12.342 --> 18:14.344
Is that pineapple?

18:14.385 --> 18:16.179
Uh, and ham.
It's, uh, it's Hawaiian.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.723
Um, I'll admit, it's a bit
of an acquired taste.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.142
How did you acquire it?

18:21.184 --> 18:22.894
When I was stationed
in Honolulu.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.562
Oh. Were you in the Army?

18:24.604 --> 18:27.524
Air Force. It's how I paid
for dental school.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.817
Ever jump out of a plane?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.276
A few times.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.653
What was it like?

18:31.694 --> 18:33.321
Terrifying. It's...

18:33.363 --> 18:34.697
-(both laugh)
-No, it... You're hurtling

18:34.739 --> 18:36.407
at the Earth
over a hundred miles an hour.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.159

I'm presenting a paper

19:01.766 --> 19:04.602
And I'm kind of nervous.
I don't love public speaking.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.772
