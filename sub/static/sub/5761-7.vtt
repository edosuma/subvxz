<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:10.929 --> 00:12.110
<i>I'm married,</i>

00:12.145 --> 00:14.403
<i>I live in a small town,</i>

00:14.438 --> 00:16.481
<i>and I own an antique shop.</i>

00:16.516 --> 00:18.490
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:18.525 --> 00:20.235
<i>Except that from
the time I was a little girl,</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:22.696
<i>I knew that I could
talk to the dead.</i>

00:22.779 --> 00:23.870
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

00:23.908 --> 00:27.200
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

00:27.243 --> 00:29.664
<i>They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living</i>

00:29.695 --> 00:32.415
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.045 --> 00:37.259
<i>In order to tell you my story,</i>

00:37.289 --> 00:39.461
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

00:44.966 --> 00:46.722
So...

00:46.766 --> 00:48.972
this is really,really great.

00:49.016 --> 00:53.510
Out in nature,
no one but us for miles.

00:53.518 --> 00:56.091
Who knew that camping
could be so much fun.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.661
What'd I tell you?
The clean air. The smell.

00:58.935 --> 01:00.231
- There's nothing like it.
- Yeah. I'm getting that feeling.

01:03.447 --> 01:06.453
I'm just glad you
came this time, ok?

01:06.487 --> 01:09.982
Besides, I thought when you said we were
going to the woods,you meant the woods.

01:10.025 --> 01:12.243
That place where Delia
always wants to take you to?

01:12.275 --> 01:16.493
Yeah. Salt scrubs,
seaweed wraps, massages.

01:16.538 --> 01:17.583
That would be the one.

01:17.615 --> 01:19.213
Pushaw! Uhh!

01:19.247 --> 01:23.290
Besides, we got all
the luxury right here.

01:24.336 --> 01:26.051
Ahh. And these hands,

01:26.085 --> 01:29.420
they got more magic in them
than any seafood wrap.

01:29.458 --> 01:30.592
Seaweed.

01:30.636 --> 01:32.340
Oh, right. That's it.

01:34.306 --> 01:35.550
Ahh. Yep.

01:36.938 --> 01:39.642
Ahh. This place hasn'
changed a bit.

01:39.686 --> 01:42.603
You used to come out
here with your father?

01:42.647 --> 01:43.903
Yeah.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.122
Me, my brother...

01:46.168 --> 01:48.311
and my old man.

01:48.355 --> 01:49.151
No mom?

01:49.196 --> 01:51.690
No. She loved camping
about as much as you do.

01:51.725 --> 01:53.070
Hey! Ha ha.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.942
Oh, no.

01:56.248 --> 02:00.742
Sorry. The wood
probably was just green.

02:05.418 --> 02:06.623
All right.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.752
Oh!

02:09.088 --> 02:09.871
Why don't you-

02:09.917 --> 02:11.043
I'll go-

02:12.425 --> 02:13.753
This the crisp air you
were talking about?

02:13.798 --> 02:15.881
Did I forget to mention-ahh-

02:16.258 --> 02:18.090
we might get a little weather.

02:18.126 --> 02:20.763
Zip it.

Hey, do you hear that?

02:37.906 --> 02:39.483
Hmm? Crickets.

02:39.528 --> 02:41.570
Not that.

02:42.035 --> 02:44.610
- Lanie.
- That.

03:01.925 --> 03:03.961
Lanie.

03:04.555 --> 03:06.053
Hello?

03:07.935 --> 03:10.301
Somebody out there?

03:27.865 --> 03:29.821
Lanie.

04:02.188 --> 04:06.232
Come out,come out,
wherever you are. Come out,

04:40.436 --> 04:42.642
come out

04:45.528 --> 04:47.060
Hello?

04:54.657 --> 04:55.943
Crap.

04:56.738 --> 04:58.903
Oh, where is it?

04:59.286 --> 05:01.160
Where is it?

05:04.038 --> 05:06.080
Hey. No, no, no. It's ok.

05:06.117 --> 05:07.200
It's ok, it's ok.

05:07.235 --> 05:08.253
You all right?

05:08.297 --> 05:09.963
Oh, I'm so glad it's you.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.730
I'm glad I saw your light because when
I woke up and you weren't in bed,

05:12.776 --> 05:15.492
- ... I almost freaked out.
- Sorry. I heard something.

05:15.495 --> 05:17.253
A woman's voice.

05:17.806 --> 05:20.090
I found this.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.302
That's been there for a while.

05:23.346 --> 05:25.840
Yeah. Look at this.

05:26.766 --> 05:27.940
The, uh...

05:27.976 --> 05:29.470
the  moldy sippy cup?

05:29.516 --> 05:30.973
No. No, there was a-

05:31.648 --> 05:33.602
there was a creepy baby doll.

05:33.647 --> 05:35.281
A baby doll.

05:35.316 --> 05:38.152
The woman's voice,
it sounded desperate, and...

05:38.525 --> 05:41.233
I don't know. I just feel like maybe
I should stay in case she comes back.

05:41.277 --> 05:42.741
No.

05:42.787 --> 05:46.913
I think she knows where you're staying.
We're the only ones up here for miles.

05:47.245 --> 05:49.120
Ok. You're right. If she
needs me, she'll find me.

05:49.158 --> 05:51.662
Yeah. Come on. Let's
go and get some sleep.

05:51.695 --> 05:54.080
I got some plans for tomorrow.

06:03.345 --> 06:04.841
Lanie.

06:08.017 --> 06:12.801
Come out,come out, wherever you are.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.432
Hello?

06:21.778 --> 06:23.731
Don't be afraid.

06:23.778 --> 06:25.690
I wanna help you.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.783
Lanie!

06:49.006 --> 06:50.211
Morning, sunshine.

06:52.227 --> 06:54.510
It's disgusting how cheerfu
you are in the morning.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.762
Well, you sleep much
deeper out here in the...

06:56.805 --> 06:58.060
fine air.

06:58.108 --> 07:00.061
Speak for yourself.

07:01.105 --> 07:03.483
Ah. Breakfast smells
so good. I'm starving.

07:03.515 --> 07:05.140
Yeah. Breakfast was about 4 hours ago.

07:05.187 --> 07:07.111
This would be lunch.

07:07.156 --> 07:08.481
Just tell me there's coffee.

07:08.527 --> 07:09.520
All right.

07:09.565 --> 07:11.901
Do I sense a less than
perfect night's sleep?

07:11.938 --> 07:14.072
Well, between the ghosts,

07:14.108 --> 07:16.170
stinking air-

07:16.217 --> 07:18.200
Air mattress,

07:18.246 --> 07:19.583
I didn't sleep all night.

07:19.628 --> 07:21.072
She came back? Why didn't you wake me up?

07:21.118 --> 07:24.491
'Cause I didn't have any dynamite?

07:24.548 --> 07:25.920
You know, it's weird.

07:25.957 --> 07:27.832
She made the doll appear in the fire.

07:27.878 --> 07:29.380
That's creepy.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.151
What's the message?

07:31.185 --> 07:32.841
I don't know. Stay away?

07:32.888 --> 07:37.013
She's done everything she can to get
rid of us,even that weird windstorm.

07:37.048 --> 07:38.311
You know, I'm sorry.

07:38.347 --> 07:40.340
I hope I haven't tainted
this place for you.

07:40.385 --> 07:43.443
No. I feel sorry for your ghost.

07:43.475 --> 07:45.730
Yeah. That hide and seek
song she keeps singing

07:45.778 --> 07:47.730
makes me think
she's looking for a child.

07:47.777 --> 07:49.861
Well, that would explain
why she's so territorial.

07:49.897 --> 07:52.560
She's trying to say something else.
I just don't know what.

07:54.737 --> 07:56.231
Yummy. I'm starving.

07:56.278 --> 07:57.702
You're going to need it.

07:57.736 --> 08:00.651
- Oh? - I was thinking that
we'd go on a little hike.

08:00.695 --> 08:02.161
A hike sounds nice.

08:02.206 --> 08:05.320
Might have to make a small detour.

08:06.246 --> 08:08.701
Oh, come on. You got to admit,
this is kind of exciting.

08:08.748 --> 08:10.682
Ah, I don't know. To me,

08:10.717 --> 08:12.591
a swimming hole's exciting.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.882
Haunted, rusty cars,not so exciting.

08:20.847 --> 08:22.880
It doesn't look like
there was an accident.

08:22.927 --> 08:25.012
Maybe they just ran off the road.

08:25.045 --> 08:26.342
but  there is no road here.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.641
Aha. There used to be.

08:27.687 --> 08:29.732
The main road used to
run through the pass

08:29.766 --> 08:32.022
till the forest service took over
and made this all a reserve.

08:32.057 --> 08:33.601
Look at you with that thing.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.732
Maybe this was a side road.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.280
Well, how long ago was that?

08:37.317 --> 08:41.611
I don't know. My dad and I first started
coming out here about 20 years ago.

08:43.736 --> 08:46.361
car's been here at least that long.

08:56.086 --> 08:58.180
I think I found a registration.

08:58.223 --> 09:02.674
- Only thing I can make out is Anna.
- Well, it's a first name anyway.

09:02.775 --> 09:06.005
Hey,  do you think you can trace this
license when you get back to work?

09:06.045 --> 09:07.519
I can do better than that.

09:07.559 --> 09:11.180
I can request a history of all
911 calls made out of the region.

09:11.215 --> 09:13.943
I can do that if we get out of here now

09:13.976 --> 09:17.222
because I'd really like to
make it to the falls by dark.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.731
Last one there gets pushed down!

09:28.985 --> 09:31.993
Oh, um, there's some really great
vintage baby rattles over there.

09:32.027 --> 09:33.493
Thanks. I'm just waiting on a friend.

09:33.537 --> 09:34.453
Ok.

09:34.495 --> 09:37.073
These alabaster lamps
are really hard to find.

09:37.116 --> 09:39.203
You've got a good eye.

09:39.248 --> 09:41.250
No. Absolutely not.

09:41.297 --> 09:46.250
That skateboard park is an
accident waiting to happen.

09:46.285 --> 09:48.252
You sure grant's mom
is going to be there?

09:48.296 --> 09:51.223
Is my receipt in the bag?

09:51.258 --> 09:54.061
Can you just put
her on the phone?

09:54.097 --> 09:56.130
- What? What do you mean she's not there?
- Here's your receipt.

09:56.176 --> 09:59.141
No solvents. Just some
soap and water and, um...

09:59.178 --> 10:00.601
something for your next purchase.

10:00.638 --> 10:01.772
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:01.818 --> 10:07.272
Ok, fine,but if I find out that you
didn't wear a helmet, you are dead.

10:07.305 --> 10:09.852
Yes. I love you, too.

10:09.898 --> 10:10.652
I am so sorry.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.423
That woman is never
coming back again, is she?

10:13.468 --> 10:16.150
Oh, I think she will. I gave
her a 20% off coupon.

10:16.195 --> 10:17.243
You definitely don't miss a trick.

10:17.275 --> 10:18.493
Thanks for covering for me.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.533
Anytime. Was that ned?

10:20.575 --> 10:22.000
Yeah.

10:22.035 --> 10:24.491
I always thought I'd worry
about him less as he grew up,

10:24.538 --> 10:27.160
but I worry about him more.

10:27.206 --> 10:30.872
You know, at this rate, I won't stop
worrying about him until I'm dead.

10:30.915 --> 10:32.133
If you're lucky.

10:32.175 --> 10:36.383
- Chances are, I'll still be worrying
from my grave. - Lanie!

10:36.886 --> 10:38.681
It sounds like I chose a
bad time to leave you...

10:38.716 --> 10:40.721
- Come out,come out, wherever you are!
- With the store.

10:40.755 --> 10:42.523
Oh, no. Just the opposite.

10:42.556 --> 10:46.143
It was great to take my
mind off the little daredevil.

10:46.176 --> 10:49.722
So, was camping as dreadful
as you thought it would be?

10:49.765 --> 10:52.401
Actually, it was kind of exciting.

10:52.446 --> 10:56.480
It was good for jimmy and
i to have some time alone.

10:58.238 --> 11:02.440
Aha. Fess up. Do I detect a little
biological alarm clock going off?

11:02.618 --> 11:04.492
Uh, ooh. No, nothing like that. Mm-mmm.

11:04.527 --> 11:05.502
Come on. You can tell me.

11:05.538 --> 11:07.490
I know I gripe,but motherhood rocks.

11:07.537 --> 11:08.463
You are going to love it.

11:08.495 --> 11:12.251
I'm sure I will. Can you just
excuse me for a second?

11:15.967 --> 11:16.710
What are you doing?

11:16.745 --> 11:18.173
I'm sorry.

11:18.215 --> 11:20.592
I just wanted to
see your adorable baby,

11:20.625 --> 11:23.212
and, oh, my god. She's so cute.

11:23.636 --> 11:25.170
Thanks.

11:30.935 --> 11:32.191
It's like she's testing me,

11:32.226 --> 11:33.940
trying to see if she can trust me.

11:33.977 --> 11:36.681
You think this ghost
is a worried mom...

11:36.725 --> 11:37.692
looking for her kid.

11:37.736 --> 11:42.020
Yeah, but I didn't realize until
today how intense that feeling is.

11:42.065 --> 11:43.401
Wait a minute.

11:44.826 --> 11:45.783
What happened today?

11:45.825 --> 11:48.581
I just had a couple of anxious
moms at the store. Delia being one.

11:48.616 --> 11:52.491
Please tell me that this is not the same
stove that you used with your dad.

11:52.538 --> 11:54.002
Yes, miss change the subject.

11:54.038 --> 11:56.623
That is the same stove
I used with my father.

11:56.657 --> 11:57.793
And it works like new.

11:57.837 --> 12:00.713
I got a little something for you.

12:02.427 --> 12:05.422
That's the trace, with an
address for one anna fowler.

12:05.456 --> 12:06.961
You traced the license already?

12:07.008 --> 12:09.052
Yep. That's how I roll.

12:09.085 --> 12:10.683
It expired in '86.

12:10.727 --> 12:12.471
That's probably around when she died.

12:12.515 --> 12:16.011
Well, we'll know that for sure
when the 911 trace comes back,

12:16.056 --> 12:17.981
which will probably take
a couple of weeks,

12:18.017 --> 12:21.103
because anything more than 10
years old is in the main archives.

12:21.147 --> 12:23.940
You're my hero.
This is brookside. It's close.

12:23.977 --> 12:24.901
Don't get too excited.

12:24.947 --> 12:28.573
Anybody who lives in that house
probably never heard of... anna fowler.

12:28.607 --> 12:30.241
Well, I have a secret weapon.

12:30.285 --> 12:32.621
Delia can trace real
estate transactions for me.

12:32.656 --> 12:35.291
You know, one of these days
she is going to get suspicious.

12:35.325 --> 12:37.532
Yeah, and one of these days, I'm going
to have to do something about it.

12:37.578 --> 12:41.413
<i>Come out,
come out, wherever you are.</i>

12:43.007 --> 12:43.960
Uh, you know,I'll be right back.

12:44.007 --> 12:46.790
Can you throw this thing
in the trash for me?

12:46.838 --> 12:48.331
Yeah, sure.

12:51.135 --> 12:52.503
Anna?

12:56.137 --> 12:59.641
Anna, I can't help you if
you won't talk to me.

13:03.108 --> 13:05.720
Are you looking for someone?

13:05.767 --> 13:06.861
I have to find her.

13:06.896 --> 13:08.352
Who do you have to find?

13:08.398 --> 13:10.200
My baby girl.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.990
She's lost.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.613
Can you tell me
what happened?

13:13.648 --> 13:17.870
I... I was cold.

13:17.905 --> 13:21.032
Mel, where'd you put the, um...

13:22.868 --> 13:24.990
I scared her away,didn't I?

13:25.036 --> 13:26.791
Yeah.

13:27.996 --> 13:30.960
But  she left us something.

13:44.015 --> 13:46.370
Lanie was a baby

13:46.406 --> 13:48.721
she must dead too

13:49.318 --> 13:51.771
I really shouldn't be doing this.

13:51.817 --> 13:54.031
You said you wanted to keep
a foot in real estate.

13:54.065 --> 13:57.561
Yes, to make money,but not
to snoop on other people's records.

13:57.606 --> 13:58.743
Well, it's for a good cause.

13:58.778 --> 14:00.493
A little girl's missing her doll.

14:00.525 --> 14:05.492
Well, she wouldn't be a little girl anymore
if we're looking at records this far back.

14:06.036 --> 14:08.003
Ok. Here it is.

14:08.038 --> 14:13.370
The house was sold in 1991 and
the owner's name was brad fowler.

14:13.406 --> 14:15.090
Does it say anything else about him?

14:15.126 --> 14:18.750
Like what, he's a gemini and
likes long walks on the beach?

14:18.795 --> 14:21.791
I mean, like his occupation.

14:22.048 --> 14:23.300
Uh...  he was a therapist.

14:23.347 --> 14:25.671
Hey, maybe you can kill
two birds with one stone.

14:25.717 --> 14:29.763
You're hilarious. Thank you.

14:29.798 --> 14:31.301
Sure.

14:32.478 --> 14:35.851
I just thought you'd like to
know that the car was found.

14:37.995 --> 14:39.731
This is, uh...

14:39.767 --> 14:41.602
this is strange.

14:41.638 --> 14:43.400
All those years...

14:43.446 --> 14:46.691
I'm guessing it
belonged to your wife?

14:46.735 --> 14:49.070
My wife is dead.

14:50.956 --> 14:54.083
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

14:54.127 --> 14:58.912
it's just I found something in the car that
I thought may have belonged to a child.

15:06.467 --> 15:07.843
Lanie.

15:09.345 --> 15:12.301
This was my little girl'S.

15:13.175 --> 15:16.511
It was really very,very thoughtful
of you to go to all this trouble.

15:16.555 --> 15:19.352
It was no trouble.

15:20.436 --> 15:24.890
My wife, anna, we were...
separated at the time.

15:24.938 --> 15:29.362
She died up in those woods...
in a snowstorm.

15:29.615 --> 15:32.481
Just a bit of a shock seeing all of this.

15:32.535 --> 15:35.400
I understand.

15:36.707 --> 15:41.003
I'd rather not have this.

15:41.036 --> 15:43.911
Maybe you can give it to
a hospital or something.

15:43.957 --> 15:45.913
Brings up some pretty
tough memories.

15:45.955 --> 15:47.712
I don't mean to pry,

15:47.758 --> 15:50.311
but did something happen
to your daughter also?

15:50.358 --> 15:52.882
Worse thing that can
happen to a little girl.

15:52.915 --> 15:54.510
I'm so sorry.

15:54.558 --> 15:56.472
She was abandoned
by her mother.

15:56.515 --> 15:59.343
You mean she didn't
die in the storm?

15:59.387 --> 16:00.683
No.

16:01.147 --> 16:03.432
She wasn't even in the car.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.723
She was at home with me.

16:19.866 --> 16:22.200
Where's my baby?!

16:22.578 --> 16:24.161
I don't know yet.

16:24.197 --> 16:25.743
Are you hiding her?

16:25.786 --> 16:27.923
No.

16:27.958 --> 16:30.701
I'm trying to help you, but I need
to know what you remember.

16:30.748 --> 16:33.342
Nothing. I don't remember anything.

16:33.376 --> 16:36.672
Ok. I know that this is hard,
but you have to try.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.963
It will come if you're not
afraid of remembering.

16:40.005 --> 16:42.343
But I am afraid.

16:49.015 --> 16:51.563
Look at the doll.

16:51.768 --> 16:54.733
That's what you were protecting.

16:57.698 --> 17:00.111
I was scared.

17:01.446 --> 17:03.400
It was bad out.

17:04.234 --> 17:08.361
I knew it was stupid
to be on the road,

17:08.407 --> 17:11.660
but I felt like I couldn't stop.

17:11.694 --> 17:14.330
Like I shouldn't stop.

17:15.337 --> 17:17.790
I don't know why.

17:41.276 --> 17:42.570
I panicked.

17:42.606 --> 17:44.652
Where was my baby?

17:44.686 --> 17:46.693
I couldn't remember.

17:46.737 --> 17:48.272
Anna, I...

17:49.236 --> 17:52.492
I found your husband.

17:54.078 --> 17:57.453
Lane was with him that night.
She wasn't in the car with you.

17:57.485 --> 17:58.541
What?

17:58.587 --> 18:00.911
She's alive.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.831
I can't believe it.

18:07.875 --> 18:08.841
Can I see her?

18:08.887 --> 18:11.441
No, I haven't found her yet.

18:11.485 --> 18:14.012
But there's something else.

18:15.098 --> 18:17.862
Your husband said
that you left him...

18:17.907 --> 18:20.641
and lane, that
he raised her alone.

18:20.675 --> 18:22.190
No.

18:22.225 --> 18:24.103
No. No, I would never do that.

18:24.138 --> 18:25.940
She's my life,she's all I have.

18:25.988 --> 18:27.852
Yeah. I'm sure that
that's true,but brad said-

18:27.896 --> 18:31.232
no! I didn't abandon my baby!

18:31.276 --> 18:32.522
Ok.

18:38.658 --> 18:41.572
Maybe I should talk
to her alone first.

18:41.617 --> 18:42.793
See how she feels.

18:42.827 --> 18:45.913
Brad said that she
lives nearby, so...

18:45.957 --> 18:47.250
I have to see her.

18:47.288 --> 18:48.632
You will.

18:48.666 --> 18:51.423
I swear. Just...

18:51.467 --> 18:53.961
let me do this first.

18:54.005 --> 18:56.960
My baby's alive.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.390
Hi. I'm melinda gordon.

19:01.437 --> 19:03.643
I own the antique
shop in town.

19:03.687 --> 19:06.352
I found something that
I think you might want.

19:06.385 --> 19:08.282
I talked to your dad-

19:08.328 --> 19:10.182
oh, my god. My muffins.

19:10.226 --> 19:11.850
Come in. Come in.

19:11.887 --> 19:13.481
please don't burn

19:16.987 --> 19:18.651
Hot, hot, hot!

19:19.737 --> 19:20.942
Oh, oh!god

19:21.746 --> 19:24.532
You'd never guess
I do this for a living.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.033
Ah. Chocolate peanut butter cup.

19:27.077 --> 19:28.543
My new greatest invention.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.412
Those aren't the ones they
sell at village java, are they?

19:31.458 --> 19:32.592
The very same.

19:32.626 --> 19:35.541
I love those. I'm totally addicted.

19:35.578 --> 19:38.041
It's part of my evil plan.

19:38.085 --> 19:40.013
I do birthdays, too.

19:40.046 --> 19:43.010
So, you were saying that,
uh, my father sent you?

19:43.046 --> 19:45.170
But if what you found is a wedding dress,

19:45.216 --> 19:46.921
- ... you can forget about it.
- A dress?

19:47.016 --> 19:50.180
I know he means well, and I'm sure
your vintage pieces are very sweet,

19:50.217 --> 19:54.773
but I told him a gazillion times,
it's a hawaiian luau.

19:54.806 --> 19:56.891
I mean, I love the guy to bits, but

19:56.938 --> 19:59.231
it's my wedding, right?

19:59.658 --> 20:00.943
I'm-you know-actually-

20:00.977 --> 20:02.210
ah! Oh!

20:02.245 --> 20:03.441
Lanie!

20:06.327 --> 20:09.113
I'm  such a klutz.

20:10.246 --> 20:12.332
Don't scare me like that.

20:12.375 --> 20:15.621
I thought you were
at the library studying.

20:15.657 --> 20:18.871
Well, I couldn't stay
away from you so long.

20:21.087 --> 20:24.132
Ok. Enough with the flowers.
I get it. You're sorry,

20:24.167 --> 20:28.633
but we are running
out of vases.

20:28.677 --> 20:30.112
Oh, god. I'm so rude.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.511
Todd, this is melinda.

20:31.556 --> 20:34.342
She owns that cute
antique store downtown.

20:34.386 --> 20:36.483
Oh, yeah. It was nice to meet you.

20:36.518 --> 20:38.640
Hey, babe, I'm gonna squeeze in a
couple more hours before dinner.

20:38.676 --> 20:39.812
Great.

20:39.857 --> 20:41.852
As if getting married
wasn't enough,

20:41.897 --> 20:44.693
he's studying for the bar.

20:45.066 --> 20:47.522
Mmm. Why all the flowers?

20:47.566 --> 20:49.112
he feels bad.

20:49.156 --> 20:51.651
It was a nothing argument really.

20:51.696 --> 20:52.701
It was my fault.

20:52.746 --> 20:55.080
But who's complaining, right?

20:55.115 --> 20:57.573
Right. Um, actually,
I didn't come here about a dress.

20:57.615 --> 21:01.203
I wanted to return
something to you.

21:03.457 --> 21:05.503
Uh, no. That's-that's not mine.

21:05.537 --> 21:07.052
Why would you think it is?

21:07.087 --> 21:10.171
Because I found it
in your mom's car.

21:11.348 --> 21:12.390
Lanie

21:12.428 --> 21:14.090
It;s yours,isn't?

21:14.845 --> 21:16.053
What?

21:21.437 --> 21:23.512
we should go
outside and talk.

21:23.557 --> 21:25.061
Ok.

21:30.406 --> 21:33.272
My mom left
when I was 3,but

21:33.318 --> 21:35.750
it still gets to me.

21:35.798 --> 21:38.191
So you remember her?

21:38.238 --> 21:40.242
Some.

21:40.286 --> 21:43.500
How she used to sing along to the radio,

21:43.537 --> 21:46.790
the way she smelled when
she kissed me good night.

21:47.498 --> 21:50.602
The rest I just
learned from my dad.

21:50.645 --> 21:53.711
Did your dad
tell you why she left?

21:56.597 --> 21:57.723
Look, um...

21:57.757 --> 22:01.133
you're real
easy to talk to, but...

22:01.178 --> 22:03.970
why are you asking me this?

22:05.228 --> 22:07.231
Your mother...

22:07.266 --> 22:09.101
her spirit is still here.

22:09.136 --> 22:10.442
I've seen her.

22:10.477 --> 22:12.680
I've spoken to her.

22:13.948 --> 22:16.520
You're telling me you've
seen my mother's ghost?

22:16.565 --> 22:18.363
I know.

22:18.406 --> 22:20.231
Believe me, I know
that it sounds crazy,

22:20.278 --> 22:24.361
but... it's my gift.

22:25.036 --> 22:26.743
She's the one who
gave me this doll,

22:28.036 --> 22:32.053
and she wanted to find you very badly.
She loves you very much.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.292
What are you doing?

22:34.916 --> 22:37.673
Why are you doing this to me?

22:37.706 --> 22:38.833
What?

22:39.127 --> 22:42.041
Nothing. I'm just
telling you the truth.

22:42.098 --> 22:44.212
My mother was mentally ill.

22:44.767 --> 22:47.630
My father said she had
delusional paranoia.

22:48.226 --> 22:50.131
She left us.

22:50.727 --> 22:52.411
She left me,
and then she died,

22:52.448 --> 22:54.102
so I couldn't even know her.

22:59.486 --> 23:00.353
Uh! What the hell!

23:06.327 --> 23:07.981
- What happened?
- I don't know.

23:08.445 --> 23:10.453
it just explosion

23:10.485 --> 23:11.913
Anna.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.701
What are you doing?

23:13.736 --> 23:15.413
I'm sorry. I-I think

23:15.458 --> 23:17.832
anna is doing this.
I'm just not really sure why.

23:20.205 --> 23:23.922
Look,I don't know what you're trying to
pull, but I want you out of here,ok? Now.

23:26.888 --> 23:28.042
You ok?

23:28.088 --> 23:29.213
Uh... yeah.

23:42.396 --> 23:44.642
- What happened in there?
- I had to see her.

23:44.685 --> 23:45.942
She needs me.

23:45.985 --> 23:47.602
She's a big girl now.
She grew up really well.

23:47.647 --> 23:49.231
You don't have to worry
about her anymore.

23:49.277 --> 23:50.490
Yes,I do!

23:50.525 --> 23:53.573
Look,if your marriage ended badly,
I'm really sorry about that,

23:53.608 --> 23:55.580
but you can't take
it out on lane and todd.

23:55.615 --> 24:00.030
Believe me,the best thing that you can do
for your daughter is just to move on.

24:00.995 --> 24:02.413
No.

24:03.295 --> 24:05.661
As long as my baby needs me,

24:05.706 --> 24:07.622
I'm never leaving.

24:53.415 --> 24:54.750
Please!

24:57.845 --> 24:59.343
- Todd?!
- No!

25:02.058 --> 25:03.592
What's going
on in there?!

25:08.436 --> 25:10.221
Todd?!

25:16.067 --> 25:16.903
Hello?

25:16.947 --> 25:20.523
You have to get
over here quick.

25:20.568 --> 25:22.690
I think I need you.

25:25.445 --> 25:26.580
The door's jammed.

25:26.616 --> 25:28.202
Don't worry.
Jim will get us in.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.743
Todd?!

25:33.376 --> 25:34.460
Todd,

25:34.498 --> 25:36.082
where are you,man?

25:37.127 --> 25:39.461
Oh,my god!
Baby!

25:39.507 --> 25:41.331
It's all right. He's all right.
Come over here. Come over here.

25:41.378 --> 25:42.502
Oh,my god.
He's bleeding.

25:42.548 --> 25:43.260
Go away!

25:43.298 --> 25:45.011
He's gonna
need stitches.

25:45.057 --> 25:46.053
- I'm gonna go grab
- my kit. Pressure.

25:47.425 --> 25:48.932
It wasn't enough
that she abandoned me?

25:48.975 --> 25:51.182
She's got to come back from
the grave to haunt me?!

25:51.216 --> 25:53.780
I don't know why
she's not moving on,

25:53.816 --> 25:56.350
but I'll try to fix it,ok?
I promise.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.550
I have no idea
how to fix this.

25:58.597 --> 26:00.693
Oh,yeah?
Maybe this'll help.

26:00.737 --> 26:03.100
911 report. We just
got it faxed to us.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.570
"Anna fowler.
Female. Caucasian.

26:05.617 --> 26:08.230
Cause of death, hyperthermia.
"Page one of 3". Where's the rest of it?

26:08.275 --> 26:10.191
Hey,hey,hey. That was before
we got computerized.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.240
We're lucky to have
gotten anything at all.

26:12.785 --> 26:14.873
I'm sorry
I'm so grumpy.

26:14.915 --> 26:17.620
Grumpy? You got a crazy ghost
making you crazy.

26:17.655 --> 26:19.463
Oh,I married
a comedian.

26:19.498 --> 26:22.080
Hey,the guy who wrote this report,
do you know him?

26:22.117 --> 26:24.711
Yeah. I know andy.

26:25.465 --> 26:27.883
Sure,I remember
that night.

26:28.635 --> 26:30.882
Changed me forever.

26:34.267 --> 26:37.180
Got a call that morning
from the woman's sister...

26:37.688 --> 26:40.182
she was worried because she
hadn't shown up the night before.

26:40.725 --> 26:42.772
Andy,you led
the rescue team up,right?

26:42.817 --> 26:46.183
Not right away. That storm
was something fierce.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.690
Worst I'd seen up
till then.

26:50.158 --> 26:52.772
Had to wait until it was
practically dark for it to subside.

26:53.118 --> 26:56.362
It couldn't have been easy finding her
with all that snow falling.

26:57.285 --> 26:58.993
You're not kidding.

26:59.458 --> 27:02.243
There was no sign of her
along the main road, so we split up.

27:05.997 --> 27:08.541
The footprints were pretty well
covered already.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.081
But I knew
they had to be hers.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.593
So I followed them
for quite a ways.

27:22.727 --> 27:25.301
I knew right away that
she didn't make it.

27:31.898 --> 27:34.522
I went to check
her pulse...

27:35.737 --> 27:37.650
and that's
when I realized...

27:38.737 --> 27:40.570
what?

27:42.077 --> 27:44.363
What did you realize?

27:55.257 --> 27:57.671
The little girl...

27:59.925 --> 28:01.421
was alive.

28:02.137 --> 28:04.112
It was a miracle.

28:04.156 --> 28:06.093
A true miracle.

28:06.518 --> 28:10.351
Her mother used the warmth
of her own body to keep her kid alive.

28:15.066 --> 28:17.771
Lane was with her mother
that night.

28:18.276 --> 28:20.981
Anna died trying
to save her baby.

28:21.016 --> 28:23.691
Why would her husband
lie about that?

28:29.497 --> 28:31.540
y would bradlie about that?

28:31.575 --> 28:34.082
I don't know. But I think
that you do and...

28:34.335 --> 28:37.621
I hope bringing you back here
will help you remember.

28:41.875 --> 28:44.380
She was with me.

28:46.097 --> 28:47.642
She was with me.

28:47.676 --> 28:50.972
Yes. She was. Anna...

28:51.636 --> 28:54.513
no. You don't
understand. It...

28:54.556 --> 28:57.183
it all makes sense now.

29:11.908 --> 29:13.651
Mommy!

29:15.657 --> 29:18.623
Mommy,my dolly!
Mommy!

29:19.417 --> 29:21.791
I knew I should stay
in the car,but...

29:21.827 --> 29:23.581
it was like
a refrigerator.

29:23.617 --> 29:26.253
Mommy,I'm scared.

29:30.297 --> 29:33.751
I thought if
I just kept moving.

29:35.677 --> 29:36.723
Come on,sweetie.

29:36.768 --> 29:40.012
I was scared.
I was trying to get away.

29:40.058 --> 29:42.803
I just couldn't
let him find me.

29:43.187 --> 29:45.523
Who?
Who were you running from?

29:45.858 --> 29:48.183
- My husband.
- Brad?

29:48.225 --> 29:50.440
- Yeah.
- Why?

29:52.068 --> 29:54.192
He hit me.

29:55.076 --> 29:57.780
- Again.
- Anna...

29:57.825 --> 30:00.400
I always thought
it was my fault.

30:01.205 --> 30:04.621
If I could just be
a better wife.

30:06.457 --> 30:08.001
Until that night...

30:08.047 --> 30:11.040
Come back here!
I'm not done!

30:11.377 --> 30:12.093
Open the door!

30:12.128 --> 30:14.250
And we had another one
of our fights.

30:14.295 --> 30:16.383
Anna!
Open the door!

30:16.428 --> 30:18.942
I thought
she was asleep,

30:18.985 --> 30:21.472
but our fighting woke her up.

30:22.767 --> 30:24.182
Oh, baby.

30:25.227 --> 30:28.610
- Oh, baby.
- Anna! let me in!

30:29.066 --> 30:31.041
Mommy,don't
let him in.

30:31.077 --> 30:33.000
Please don't
let him in.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.940
I saw how scared she was.

30:35.646 --> 30:38.023
And I knew
we had to get out.

30:38.065 --> 30:40.361
But if you
were being abused...

30:40.407 --> 30:43.241
why didn't your friends
or anyone help you?

30:43.277 --> 30:46.033
I was too ashamed
to tell them.

30:46.535 --> 30:49.712
I wore long sleeves
to cover the bruises.

30:49.747 --> 30:52.542
And if anyone did notice,
I'd just laugh it off.

30:53.048 --> 30:54.830
Clumsy me.

30:55.915 --> 30:58.583
Everyone thought we were
the perfect couple.

30:59.218 --> 31:01.920
And we were when
we weren't fighting.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.883
Brad would feel so bad
after one of our fights,

31:04.927 --> 31:08.381
he'd spoil me
like crazy,presents,

31:08.418 --> 31:11.841
big bouquets of flowers,
the works.

31:13.435 --> 31:16.353
Is that why
you attacked todd?

31:16.647 --> 31:19.563
Because you saw him give
lane the bouquet of flowers?

31:19.608 --> 31:22.183
When I saw him
with that bouquet,

31:22.225 --> 31:24.963
something just snapped
inside of me.

31:24.996 --> 31:27.691
She has to know
what you went through.

31:28.947 --> 31:31.113
What you did for her.

31:40.755 --> 31:42.541
Please tell me
she's not here.

31:42.578 --> 31:44.833
It's just me.

31:47.346 --> 31:48.640
She gone for good?

31:48.676 --> 31:52.130
No,but she said she'd stay away
until you're ready to see her.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.262
That would be never.

31:54.977 --> 31:57.143
Anna didn't abandon you.

31:59.857 --> 32:01.393
What?

32:02.276 --> 32:05.480
I talked to the paramedic
who rescued you.

32:05.986 --> 32:08.731
You were with her
when she died.

32:09.866 --> 32:12.400
I was with her
when she left my dad?

32:12.445 --> 32:14.863
She took you
with her.

32:14.908 --> 32:16.650
But...

32:17.826 --> 32:19.620
why would my dad
lie about that?

32:20.458 --> 32:22.160
Maybe he feels ashamed.

32:22.197 --> 32:23.913
Ashamed of what?

32:24.377 --> 32:27.373
My dad? He's the greatest dad
anyone could ask for.

32:27.415 --> 32:29.662
Did some pretty bad
things to your mom.

32:29.707 --> 32:31.881
Look,my dad would
never hurt anyone,ok?

32:31.925 --> 32:34.673
If she said he did,
it's because she's crazy.

32:35.255 --> 32:38.800
I don't know. Maybe she hates me.
You saw what she did to todd.

32:38.837 --> 32:40.810
That was because
of the flowers.

32:40.846 --> 32:43.020
Your dad always gave
her flowers after they had a fight.

32:43.056 --> 32:45.392
It was a gut reaction when she saw todd
give you the bouquet.

32:45.427 --> 32:47.443
Ok. Stop.
You've gone too far.

32:47.478 --> 32:49.850
I don't need you
meddling in my life.

32:49.897 --> 32:52.190
It's complicated
enough right now.

32:52.236 --> 32:55.653
Your mom died trying to keep you safe.
She wanted to protect you.

32:56.158 --> 32:58.651
And now she needs to
know that you're ok so she can move on.

32:58.698 --> 33:01.572
Would it kill you
to just at least talk to her?

33:02.907 --> 33:05.032
That ship's already sailed.

33:12.876 --> 33:15.832
At least I know I can trust my instincts.
Anna isn't crazy.

33:15.878 --> 33:17.092
But lane didn't
believe you?

33:17.138 --> 33:20.003
When I told her her mom was abused,
she just shut down.

33:20.387 --> 33:22.401
Well,that's a pretty big
bomb you dropped on her.

33:22.447 --> 33:24.390
Kind of blows away
everything she grew up believing.

33:24.425 --> 33:26.111
Yeah. Her father is a therapist.

33:26.156 --> 33:27.871
I mean,you'd think he'd
have it all figured out.

33:27.915 --> 33:28.732
I guess she
never really know.

33:28.766 --> 33:32.431
Yeah. Well,I wouldn't
mind meeting that guy in a dark room.

33:32.475 --> 33:34.730
You are a bigger
softie than me.

33:39.945 --> 33:42.773
It was a nothing argument.
My fault really.

33:42.815 --> 33:45.401
I always thought
it was my fault.

33:50.207 --> 33:52.581
- It's happening.
- It's happening.

33:52.618 --> 33:55.123
Oh,my god!
I gotta go!

34:16.108 --> 34:20.100
Lane! Lane,
it's melinda!

34:20.606 --> 34:22.521
Are you ok?

34:28.406 --> 34:30.532
I'm fine.

34:30.576 --> 34:32.453
Now isn't a good time.

34:32.498 --> 34:34.531
Do you want me
to get you out of here?

34:34.577 --> 34:36.741
Are you crazy?

34:37.915 --> 34:39.831
You've done
enough damage.

34:39.876 --> 34:41.503
Lane, get in here

34:41.534 --> 34:43.040
Lane!

34:53.428 --> 34:55.971
I left so this would stop.

34:56.007 --> 34:58.053
But it didn'T.

34:58.088 --> 35:00.102
It never will.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.142
Then we have
to do something.

35:03.187 --> 35:05.891
She won't listen to me...

35:05.938 --> 35:08.003
or to you.

35:08.036 --> 35:09.882
Not now.

35:09.925 --> 35:11.703
What?

35:11.737 --> 35:13.692
Is this some
twisted joke?

35:13.738 --> 35:14.621
I'm sorry.

35:14.657 --> 35:16.401
I would normally
do this slowly,

35:16.447 --> 35:18.121
explain gently
that I have a gift,

35:18.155 --> 35:20.241
I can see spirits,I can
cross them over,yada,yada.

35:20.275 --> 35:22.321
Frankly,I don't have
the patience or the time.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.750
- Lane needs you.
- What do you mean?

35:24.796 --> 35:28.662
I think she's being abused,
just like you abused her mother.

35:31.178 --> 35:34.632
What,um...
what makes you say that?

35:34.676 --> 35:36.433
Look,brad,you don't have
to believe I can see ghosts,

35:36.465 --> 35:39.261
but please believe
what I'm telling you about your daughter.

35:40.595 --> 35:45.601
Ok. Ok. I'll admit
I had doubts about todd.

35:46.395 --> 35:48.303
I always thought it was
just my own paranoia,

35:48.337 --> 35:50.031
projecting my own
demons onto him.

35:50.068 --> 35:51.901
But I know he loves her.

35:51.937 --> 35:55.603
You loved me,too.
Said you couldn't live without me.

35:55.647 --> 35:58.650
You always said
your heart beat only for me.

35:58.685 --> 36:01.653
You said your heart beat
only for her.

36:04.406 --> 36:06.741
Is she really here?

36:08.125 --> 36:10.001
Can-can-can you tell her-

36:10.036 --> 36:13.913
tell her that I'm not
the same person anymore?

36:13.958 --> 36:17.792
That I've gotten help,and
now I'm helping others.

36:17.836 --> 36:20.300
I know that look of his,

36:20.348 --> 36:24.303
so full of guilt
and remorse.

36:24.337 --> 36:26.972
She can hear you.

36:27.516 --> 36:29.640
Anna...

36:31.808 --> 36:34.181
I'm so sorry for...

36:35.067 --> 36:37.110
for what I did.

36:37.148 --> 36:40.813
I just...
hope you can forgive me.

36:46.997 --> 36:51.860
All those times
you begged me to forgive you,

36:52.206 --> 36:54.670
and I did...

36:54.706 --> 36:57.371
because I loved you,

36:58.005 --> 37:02.173
because I believed
you could change.

37:02.208 --> 37:05.593
And it looks
like you have,

37:06.927 --> 37:09.932
but I can't
forgive you.

37:09.966 --> 37:15.303
I forgave you too many
times when I was alive.

37:16.185 --> 37:19.721
She wishes she could,
but it's too late.

37:20.148 --> 37:21.600
Right.

37:23.697 --> 37:26.152
Of course...

37:26.197 --> 37:30.321
brad,the reason that anna is earthbound
is not because of what you did to her.

37:30.737 --> 37:31.911
It's lane.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.543
You have one chance
to redeem yourself,

37:34.575 --> 37:37.530
to help your daughter, please
tell her the truth about you,

37:37.578 --> 37:40.123
so she that can she
can know the truth about todd.

37:46.128 --> 37:49.382
I didn't want you to know.
That's why I lied.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.423
I know it was wrong.

37:54.557 --> 37:57.341
I hated myself
for what I did to her.

37:59.305 --> 38:02.800
I couldn't live
if you hated me,too.

38:04.147 --> 38:06.733
My mom didn't abandon me?

38:09.198 --> 38:11.693
No.
She didn'T.

38:13.488 --> 38:16.863
So you let me believe
that my mother left me?

38:17.907 --> 38:21.031
That she didn't love me?

38:21.578 --> 38:25.123
Lanie, the only reason I'm
bringing this up now

38:25.165 --> 38:30.083
is because I don't want you to make
the same mistake your mother did.

38:30.115 --> 38:32.132
What do you mean?

38:32.176 --> 38:35.250
Anna thinks todd
is hurting you.

38:38.506 --> 38:40.553
Lanie...

38:41.555 --> 38:45.141
they say that little girls
marry their fathers-

38:45.177 --> 38:47.140
just stop it,ok?

38:47.188 --> 38:49.151
Todd and I are happy.

38:49.186 --> 38:51.561
We're getting married,
he's gonna pass the bar,

38:51.595 --> 38:53.891
and everything
is gonna be great.

38:53.938 --> 38:55.771
Just stop this.

38:55.805 --> 38:57.613
Lanie,please.

39:04.035 --> 39:06.201
No.

39:06.746 --> 39:09.952
My head is spinning.

39:11.288 --> 39:14.702
I can't even think
about this right now.

39:21.257 --> 39:23.592
So you think she's waiting
to see if lane's okay?

39:23.636 --> 39:26.511
Sure. And believe me, she'll know.
She's got the mommy-radar.

39:26.555 --> 39:30.390
You know,I always wondered how my mom
knew I spiked the punch at junior prom.

39:31.185 --> 39:34.981
Go ahead, make fun of me,
but,you know what, it's powerful stuff.

39:35.157 --> 39:37.820
See, I think anna was in limbo.
Earthbound but unaware.

39:37.856 --> 39:39.431
Her daughter got engaged,

39:39.476 --> 39:42.173
and it sent a ripple effect through
the universe that woke her up.

39:43.027 --> 39:45.110
Oh, to be continued.

39:52.576 --> 39:54.780
Is my mother here?

39:56.085 --> 39:58.951
I always told myself
it would get better.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.962
When he passed the bar...

40:04.338 --> 40:06.551
when we got married.

40:06.588 --> 40:09.672
When we moved
into a bigger house.

40:13.598 --> 40:16.092
He wasn't going
to change.

40:16.135 --> 40:18.561
You did the right thing.

40:18.607 --> 40:21.433
My mother did
the right thing.

40:21.977 --> 40:24.360
Is that why
she stayed here?

40:24.397 --> 40:27.812
To stop me from
staying with him?

40:32.368 --> 40:34.913
Can I...

40:34.946 --> 40:37.863
can I thank her?

40:38.957 --> 40:41.370
You just did.

40:41.786 --> 40:44.123
She's here?

40:46.338 --> 40:48.801
She's so beautiful.

40:48.837 --> 40:53.251
I can't believe this is the
tiny little girl I held in my arms.

40:53.295 --> 40:54.970
Mom?

40:55.008 --> 40:57.840
She wants you to know
how proud she is of you.

41:01.938 --> 41:04.680
No,mom. It was you.

41:06.186 --> 41:09.522
I can't believe how strong you were
to do what you did.

41:09.555 --> 41:12.153
How tough you were.

41:13.947 --> 41:16.151
You protected me.

41:18.236 --> 41:19.993
You saved me.

41:22.288 --> 41:24.532
We saved ourselves.

41:27.417 --> 41:29.872
I'm so scared,mom.

41:30.507 --> 41:32.872
I don't know
what I'm going to do now.

41:35.507 --> 41:37.633
Yes,you do.

41:38.135 --> 41:40.421
It's inside you.

41:41.385 --> 41:43.923
Remember
how strong you are.

41:45.388 --> 41:47.640
And just think of me,

41:47.678 --> 41:49.850
and I'll be with you.

41:49.896 --> 41:53.103
I'll be watching you
from wherever I am.

41:53.895 --> 41:56.692
She wants you to remember
how strong you are.

41:57.736 --> 42:00.481
She will always
be watching over you.

42:04.075 --> 42:06.322
I love you,mom.

42:08.156 --> 42:10.911
I feel like I never
got to say it to her.

42:11.577 --> 42:13.872
You don't have
to say it.

42:14.668 --> 42:17.000
We both know it.

42:30.935 --> 42:33.342
Thank you
for everything.

42:44.527 --> 42:46.063
She's gone?

42:46.106 --> 42:47.780
Yeah.

42:47.828 --> 42:49.861
But she's happy.

42:51.365 --> 42:53.651
At peace.

43:15.175 --> 43:17.721
I can't
thank you enough.

43:21.516 --> 43:24.311
I don't know
what else to say.
