WEBVTT

00:11.287 --> 00:12.587
Good morning, Officer Nolan.

00:12.622 --> 00:13.970
Ready for another exciting day

00:14.007 --> 00:15.256
out on the streets of Los Angeles?

00:15.367 --> 00:17.258
Yep. Coffee?

00:17.293 --> 00:19.126
No, thanks, I get all the rush I need

00:19.162 --> 00:20.658
from making this beautiful city of ours

00:20.695 --> 00:21.914
safer every single day.

00:21.951 --> 00:25.335
And you will too
if you join the L.A.D.P....

00:25.802 --> 00:27.482
- I mean P.D.
- Cut! Go again.

00:27.519 --> 00:29.853
And you will too...

00:30.306 --> 00:31.772
Um, I'm sorry. What do I say again?

00:31.807 --> 00:33.302
- Cut!
- L.A.P.D.

00:33.339 --> 00:34.419
Action.

00:34.456 --> 00:36.689
I do too. And so will you if...

00:36.982 --> 00:39.546
as well if you join... the L.A...

00:39.582 --> 00:40.747
Cut!

00:40.784 --> 00:41.845
I need to spit out my gum.

00:41.882 --> 00:42.937
Action.

00:42.974 --> 00:45.408
And that's why we joined the L.A.P.D.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.278
L.A.'s finest.

00:50.005 --> 00:51.481
O-Okay, guys,

00:51.518 --> 00:53.536
I know there were
a few stumbles in there, yes,

00:53.596 --> 00:56.229
in the beginning,
but this is Hollywood, right?

00:56.310 --> 00:57.810
They fix that stuff in the editing.

00:57.847 --> 01:00.130
I think this video's gonna make
the department very proud.

01:00.167 --> 01:02.890
Officer Bradford,
would you like the honor?

01:02.927 --> 01:05.171
Actually, sir, I think
that should go to Lopez...

01:05.208 --> 01:07.841
- the whole thing was her idea.
- Lopez?

01:07.876 --> 01:09.676
There is no promotional video.

01:09.763 --> 01:11.644
You got punked.

01:19.716 --> 01:21.754
<i>This sucks. I... This is awful.</i>

01:21.841 --> 01:23.708
<i>No, you're doing good.</i>

01:23.745 --> 01:25.077
<i>Can I get more powder?</i>

01:25.155 --> 01:27.756
<i>I'm sweating blocks.</i>

01:27.862 --> 01:29.194
<i>Can I get a copy of this for my kid?</i>

01:37.145 --> 01:38.804
We're all gonna die.

01:41.676 --> 01:43.192
Right here.

01:43.805 --> 01:45.473
Right now.

01:46.122 --> 01:48.973
This bomb is packed with C4,

01:49.020 --> 01:50.426
ball bearings, screws, broken glass.

01:50.463 --> 01:51.763
When this thing goes off,

01:51.839 --> 01:54.171
this whole room is gonna
turn into a blender.

01:54.254 --> 01:55.411
And guess what.

01:55.458 --> 01:57.005
If you don't die instantly,

01:57.042 --> 01:59.176
you're gonna suffer fatal,
secondary infections

01:59.298 --> 02:03.434
because I soaked the shrapnel
in my own filth.

02:04.434 --> 02:07.365
Now, you've all been taught
to shoot on sight

02:07.400 --> 02:09.216
when you see a bomber, right?

02:09.252 --> 02:10.613
But you can't shoot me,

02:10.650 --> 02:13.350
because I'm holding
a dead man's switch.

02:13.439 --> 02:15.262
I let it go, it detonates.

02:15.408 --> 02:18.286
So your only shot at survival

02:18.748 --> 02:20.747
is to talk me into giving up.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.548
But... you only have

02:24.020 --> 02:26.661
ten words to do it.

02:27.387 --> 02:28.887
Go.

02:29.439 --> 02:30.961
U-Um, ma'am,

02:30.998 --> 02:32.364
you... you don't want to do this.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.403
Boom. It's a slaughterhouse in here.

02:34.481 --> 02:35.613
Go.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.684
Uh, my name is Lucy Chen, and...

02:37.721 --> 02:40.022
Boom. They're IDing
you through dental records.

02:40.091 --> 02:42.653
Boom. You just
got buried in a shoe box.

02:44.621 --> 02:47.622
I can only imagine the pain
you're feeling right now.

02:50.263 --> 02:52.129
You just got ten more words.

02:55.005 --> 02:57.544
Okay, so what did you all do wrong?

02:57.619 --> 02:59.753
Officer West started mansplaining.

02:59.790 --> 03:03.124
Officer Chen wasted time
by introducing herself.

03:03.237 --> 03:07.038
And Officer Bradford decided
to skip words altogether.

03:07.075 --> 03:08.973
They're overrated.
If I'd been a hair quicker,

03:09.010 --> 03:10.143
you'd be singing my praises.

03:10.180 --> 03:11.716
But you weren't.

03:12.096 --> 03:14.164
So that means you fall
into the fail category

03:14.201 --> 03:16.501
with everybody else... except...

03:16.896 --> 03:19.153
Officer Nolan.

03:19.527 --> 03:22.062
What did he do right?

03:22.138 --> 03:24.972
- He expressed empathy.
- You mean he faked it.

03:25.093 --> 03:27.020
It doesn't matter if it was real.

03:27.111 --> 03:30.028
The only thing that matters
is how it comes across.

03:30.145 --> 03:32.029
Active listening plus empathy

03:32.066 --> 03:33.473
leads to a rapport,

03:33.510 --> 03:34.630
which leads to influence

03:34.667 --> 03:36.497
and ultimately behavioral change.

03:36.641 --> 03:38.614
- Wow, you read my book.
- Twice.

03:38.669 --> 03:41.536
Oh. Okay, well, I read your file.

03:41.573 --> 03:43.573
Actually, I read all
of your files, but, um,

03:43.840 --> 03:46.808
nothing in your past indicates

03:46.845 --> 03:49.481
an ability to communicate
with people like that.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.731
So why do you think
that you're so good at it?

03:52.973 --> 03:54.676
Because of the training I received

03:54.713 --> 03:57.300
from Officer Bishop and Sergeant Grey.

03:59.588 --> 04:01.247
Boom.

04:01.395 --> 04:02.817
You just betrayed our trust

04:02.854 --> 04:04.152
by giving me a political answer.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.559
Our rapport is ruined,

04:05.596 --> 04:07.697
and this room is now a horror movie.

04:09.992 --> 04:11.731
Oh, my goodness. I am so embarrassed.

04:11.768 --> 04:14.434
Oh, no, don't be.

04:14.489 --> 04:15.973
You know, if they knew how to do it,

04:16.010 --> 04:17.950
then you wouldn't have called me
to come in and train them.

04:17.987 --> 04:19.302
I still can't believe that you're a

04:19.339 --> 04:20.829
private consultant now.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.270
I mean, you were such
a rock star in the Bureau.

04:23.307 --> 04:24.841
Oh. How's Luna?

04:24.911 --> 04:28.294
Great. And she's pushing me
to make a change, too.

04:28.487 --> 04:30.287
Dominique's heading off
to college, and...

04:30.903 --> 04:32.219
Well, you should.

04:32.364 --> 04:34.385
I-I... Look, you know, you... you've...

04:34.544 --> 04:36.387
you've done your 20,
you've got the, uh...

04:36.653 --> 04:38.645
the scars to prove it.

04:39.633 --> 04:42.601
- Go do something new.
- What?

04:42.809 --> 04:45.028
What else is a guy like me gonna do?

04:45.489 --> 04:46.830
Come work with me.

04:47.067 --> 04:49.333
- Work <i> for</i> you, you mean.
- Okay, come on.

04:49.653 --> 04:51.235
I am not like that. You know that.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.770
Thanks,

04:53.806 --> 04:56.540
but I am nowhere near ready
to have this conversation.

04:56.692 --> 04:58.576
Well, when you are,

04:58.973 --> 05:01.639
- the offer will still be there.
- All right.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.514
- Okay?
- All right.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:12.666 --> 05:16.044
- She's pretty impressive, huh?
- I'll say.

05:16.989 --> 05:18.628
Uh, why didn't you tell me

05:18.665 --> 05:20.030
she wrote a book about her years

05:20.067 --> 05:22.208
on the FBI's hostage rescue team?

05:22.341 --> 05:24.208
I would've been so much better prepared.

05:24.278 --> 05:25.901
How did you <i>not</i> know about it?

05:25.997 --> 05:28.114
You know, the Academy Jackson
would've been all over that.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.806
Yeah,<i> Officer</i> Jackson
is clearly slipping.

05:30.842 --> 05:32.341
Okay, no, I'm not.

05:32.378 --> 05:33.909
Wouldn't matter if you read it or not.

05:33.945 --> 05:35.612
- I'm simply better than you.
- Oh, okay.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.536
Look, well, I think that
she is full of crap.

05:38.617 --> 05:40.750
I spent summer vacations
running hostage scenarios,

05:40.903 --> 05:43.419
and I always beat my brother
and saved the hostage.

05:43.455 --> 05:44.920
Dad said it was a gift.

05:44.956 --> 05:47.716
Dad should'a sent you to camp.

05:47.795 --> 05:49.757
- What's going on?
- Prison transport crashed,

05:49.794 --> 05:51.234
loaded with convicts
from the courthouse.

05:53.496 --> 05:55.163
Come on. Get that gear, Boot.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.036
- Let's go!
- Yeah...

05:57.208 --> 05:58.501
- Let's go!
- Yeah.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.515
- Hey, what happened here?

06:17.552 --> 06:19.005
A coyote ran in front of the bus.

06:19.042 --> 06:20.989
Graham swerved. We went over.

06:21.026 --> 06:24.527
- How many people on board?
- 20 prisoners, two other guards.

06:24.564 --> 06:26.898
- Did any prisoners get away?
- I think so.

06:26.935 --> 06:30.904
Whoa, whoa, hey. Hey, get down there!
Get me a head count.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.893
<i>Control, this is 7-L-20</i>

06:32.930 --> 06:34.365
- <i>at scene of crash.</i>
- I got this one.

06:34.402 --> 06:35.842
<i>I'm declaring a
city-wide tactical alert.</i>

06:35.878 --> 06:38.106
<i>I need multiple RAs, scramble airships,</i>

06:38.143 --> 06:39.856
<i>and call additional units from Rampart</i>

06:39.893 --> 06:41.180
- <i>and North Hollywood.</i>
- He's dead.

06:41.217 --> 06:42.950
<i>I need a hard perimeter
set around the crash...</i>

06:42.987 --> 06:45.028
<i>assume a ten minute head start.</i>

06:52.750 --> 06:54.439
I got something over here, 10:00.

06:54.519 --> 06:56.408
Check it out... be careful.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.642
Don't move.

07:01.736 --> 07:03.465
An ambulance is on its way.

07:03.916 --> 07:05.923
Can you give me a sit rep?

07:06.005 --> 07:07.905
Seven of them escaped.

07:08.118 --> 07:10.970
They got my keys, my gun.

07:11.466 --> 07:13.236
They went out through the windshield.

07:13.444 --> 07:14.877
All units, be advised,

07:14.914 --> 07:16.195
seven prisoners escaped from the bus.

07:16.231 --> 07:17.354
At least one is armed.

07:18.523 --> 07:20.447
Hang tight. We're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

07:36.298 --> 07:38.158
Police. Stop!

07:41.037 --> 07:43.171
Hey, take it easy. Easy. Easy.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.814
I got you. Come on.

07:44.882 --> 07:48.283
I got you. I got you. Easy.

07:48.548 --> 07:49.815
7-Adam-15,

07:49.852 --> 07:51.447
I need an RA unit immediately...

07:51.503 --> 07:52.978
<i>60 yards east of the crash.</i>

07:53.015 --> 07:55.950
50-year-old male,
life-threatening injuries.

07:56.136 --> 07:58.173
Okay, just stop moving,
all right? Stop moving.

07:58.385 --> 08:00.952
- I gotta get help. I gotta get help.
- Shh, shh. Help is here.

08:00.989 --> 08:03.525
Help is here. I'm right here.
Hey, what's your name?

08:04.048 --> 08:05.580
Uh, Graham.

08:05.617 --> 08:07.095
Graham, I'm John.

08:07.234 --> 08:10.127
- Am I gonna die?
- No! No, come on.

08:10.164 --> 08:11.627
No, you're not gonna die. You're...

08:11.664 --> 08:12.806
You're gonna be fine, okay?

08:12.843 --> 08:14.392
You're gonna be okay. You just hang on.

08:14.521 --> 08:15.806
All right? Okay?

08:15.905 --> 08:17.305
- Hang on.
- Okay. O-Okay.

08:17.365 --> 08:19.228
7-Adam-19, almost on site.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.331
<i>Negative, we have
at least seven fugitives</i>

08:21.368 --> 08:22.833
<i>at large in surrounding neighborhoods.</i>

08:22.870 --> 08:24.056
<i>Start a grid search,</i>

08:24.093 --> 08:26.783
<i>coordinate with 7-Adam-13, 18, and 26.</i>

08:26.871 --> 08:29.478
There!

08:29.598 --> 08:31.945
7-Adam-19, in pursuit
of fugitive suspect,

08:31.982 --> 08:34.149
heading North on Maple.

08:36.556 --> 08:39.501
Down!

08:44.973 --> 08:46.619
Get on your stomach!
Get on your stomach!

08:46.693 --> 08:48.360
Let's go.

08:48.442 --> 08:49.922
Let's go. Hands behind your back.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.885
Okay, okay.

08:56.014 --> 08:58.348
7-Adam-15, where the hell
is my ambulance?

08:58.508 --> 09:00.064
Tell her... Tell her...

09:00.155 --> 09:01.955
Tell who? Tell who?

09:02.018 --> 09:04.986
- T-Tell her I love her.
- Tell who?

09:07.228 --> 09:09.128
Graham, who do you want me to tell?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.361
Beth.

09:12.431 --> 09:13.787
Okay.

09:51.877 --> 09:53.541
Where's Nolan?

09:54.416 --> 09:56.142
Officer Nolan, report.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.885
- Don't move!
- Nolan?

10:15.041 --> 10:16.735
- You okay?
- Yes.

10:16.771 --> 10:18.204
Get control of him.

10:28.853 --> 10:30.650
All right, listen up.

10:31.012 --> 10:32.902
This is what we know so far.

10:32.969 --> 10:34.903
So, we have seven fugitives at large...

10:35.056 --> 10:36.355
Six.

10:36.975 --> 10:39.457
Good work. Correction...

10:39.727 --> 10:41.661
we have <i> six</i> fugitives at large.

10:41.829 --> 10:44.473
- Five.
- At this rate,

10:44.559 --> 10:47.996
I'd say we'd be home for dinner,
but I know better.

10:48.336 --> 10:51.737
A prisoner on foot can sustain
a pace of four miles per hour.

10:51.774 --> 10:53.741
And the clock started ticking
20 minutes ago.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.293
So we have a hard perimeter
set up a mile out.

10:56.379 --> 10:57.968
If it was set up in time,

10:58.005 --> 10:59.365
it's just a matter
of going door-to-door

10:59.408 --> 11:01.447
and running these fugitives down.

11:01.484 --> 11:04.332
If a fugitive gets past our perimeter,

11:04.488 --> 11:08.176
this turns from a recovery
operation to a manhunt.

11:08.290 --> 11:10.668
And that puts the entire city at risk.

11:10.747 --> 11:13.347
So Bishop, Wong, Mitchell, Pileggi...

11:13.420 --> 11:15.788
your shops will fall back
and man the perimeter.

11:16.348 --> 11:18.795
Bradford, Lopez, Keegan, and Willis,

11:18.973 --> 11:21.816
you'll join the grid search
inside the zone.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.113
Command will advise you
on the identities

11:24.150 --> 11:26.283
of the guys you're chasing
as soon as we get them,

11:26.357 --> 11:30.093
but for now, assume that they
are all extremely dangerous.

11:30.277 --> 11:31.660
Let's go get 'em.

11:44.410 --> 11:46.730
<i>This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.</i>

11:46.846 --> 11:49.059
<i>For your own safety,
we ask you to lock your doors</i>

11:49.142 --> 11:51.742
<i>and stay inside
due to an ongoing emergency.</i>

11:57.270 --> 11:59.387
License and registration, please.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.288
Pop the trunk, please.

12:06.246 --> 12:07.691
Officer Nolan.

12:13.824 --> 12:16.543
All right, have a nice day.

12:20.964 --> 12:23.129
Hey, you sure you're okay?

12:24.041 --> 12:25.787
Before that deputy died, he asked me

12:25.824 --> 12:27.973
to pass along a message.
Shouldn't I be doing that?

12:28.010 --> 12:29.977
You're doing exactly
what you should be doing.

12:30.138 --> 12:32.480
Hard as it sounds,
that message can wait.

12:32.637 --> 12:34.926
That bus was full of hardcore felons.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.038
Desperate men.
If we don't catch them quickly,

12:37.075 --> 12:38.941
somebody else could die.

12:39.408 --> 12:40.746
All right.

12:52.549 --> 12:55.026
Sir, there's a shelter
in place order in effect.

12:55.104 --> 12:56.987
- We need you in your house.
- Okay.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.674
Oh. Tim.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.119
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Get your hands

13:07.184 --> 13:09.284
- where I can see them. Now!
- No, stay right there.

13:09.321 --> 13:11.454
It's okay.
We got permits for the weapons,

13:11.491 --> 13:13.858
and our ammo is stored
separately, so it's legal.

13:13.978 --> 13:15.277
I don't care if it's legal.

13:15.354 --> 13:16.578
No good's gonna come from you guys

13:16.613 --> 13:18.221
running around here
with assault rifles.

13:18.363 --> 13:19.996
We heard prisoners were on the loose.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.532
We got a right to protect
our neighborhood.

13:21.569 --> 13:23.036
Yeah, that's a job for law enforcement,

13:23.073 --> 13:24.713
not a ragtag militia.

13:24.817 --> 13:26.783
Got one! Got a fugitive!

13:26.820 --> 13:28.500
Hey, get off me, man.
I didn't do anything.

13:28.537 --> 13:30.606
- Officers, please.
- Hey, let him go.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.776
That's not who we're looking for.

13:31.813 --> 13:33.527
- I kept telling him that!
- You sure?

13:33.562 --> 13:35.041
He looks guilty as hell to me.

13:35.078 --> 13:36.878
- At least check his papers.
- Let him go.

13:37.346 --> 13:39.531
Right now. Are you okay?

13:39.568 --> 13:41.202
No, you should be arresting them.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.877
Hey, screw that.
The law says we're allowed

13:42.914 --> 13:44.634
to defend our neighborhood
"when in grave danger."

13:44.712 --> 13:47.018
- I was trimming a hedge!
- All right, look, that's enough.

13:47.055 --> 13:48.501
Get back.

13:48.553 --> 13:50.448
Look, as bigoted as they are,

13:50.494 --> 13:51.941
they thought they were
making a citizen's arrest,

13:51.977 --> 13:53.229
so they haven't broken the law.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.966
But their names will be in our report,

13:55.003 --> 13:56.979
so if you'd like to sue them
for emotional damages,

13:57.120 --> 13:58.419
- you can.
- Whoa, hey, now...

13:58.454 --> 13:59.918
How about we just all, uh,

13:59.955 --> 14:01.755
go back and secure our home fronts.

14:02.571 --> 14:04.057
No hard feelings.

14:06.206 --> 14:07.479
Fine.

14:07.599 --> 14:09.273
If I find out that you're
back out here again,

14:09.310 --> 14:10.550
I'll have you arrested for violating

14:10.587 --> 14:13.158
California Penal Codes 372 and 647b.

14:14.018 --> 14:15.335
You got that?

14:20.274 --> 14:22.508
647b is the code for prostitution.

14:23.010 --> 14:24.411
They don't know that.

14:24.838 --> 14:27.034
<i>All units, possible fugitive sighting.</i>

14:27.071 --> 14:29.905
<i>Parking garage 19558 Sunset Boulevard.</i>

14:29.942 --> 14:31.462
Guy in an orange jumpsuit
took a bunch of keys,

14:31.499 --> 14:32.653
ran up the ramp.

14:39.832 --> 14:42.098
7-Adam-07, show us Code 6
on fugitive suspect.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.432
Police! Turn off the engine

15:04.469 --> 15:05.718
and get out of the car now!

15:06.651 --> 15:08.166
Show me your hands.

15:08.268 --> 15:10.330
Open the door from the outside.

15:12.135 --> 15:13.963
Get down on your stomach.

15:14.861 --> 15:17.768
- What's your name?
- Oscar Hutchinson.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.932
Control, we have fugitive
Hutchinson in custody.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.471
I was only running because I thought

15:22.544 --> 15:24.018
the bus was gonna explode.

15:24.055 --> 15:26.236
Uh-huh,
is that why you stole a car, too?

15:26.372 --> 15:27.838
I always loved driving.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.143
Ah, I've been locked up for decades.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.932
I was kind of hoping to get
a little "me" time in

15:33.968 --> 15:35.362
before you guys caught me.

15:35.407 --> 15:37.040
I hope it was enough,
'cause your sentence

15:37.077 --> 15:38.181
is only gonna get longer now.

15:38.218 --> 15:40.184
Oh, I'm in forever, son.

15:40.220 --> 15:42.119
Every moment out here is gravy.

15:44.983 --> 15:46.950
You're free to go. Thank you.

15:53.579 --> 15:56.000
License and registration, please.

16:01.219 --> 16:03.306
Okay there, Mr... Bernstein?

16:04.188 --> 16:06.336
Yeah. Yes.

16:06.512 --> 16:08.278
Where you coming from today?

16:09.281 --> 16:10.774
Pre-school.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.000
We're looking for some men
who escaped from prison.

16:14.037 --> 16:16.170
You haven't seen anyone
like that, have you?

16:16.377 --> 16:17.576
No, sir.

16:17.891 --> 16:19.489
Would you pop the trunk for me?

16:21.548 --> 16:22.844
What?

16:28.898 --> 16:30.487
I need you to pop the trunk.

16:57.495 --> 16:58.961
Mr. Bernstein,

16:59.078 --> 17:00.830
so sorry to take up your time today.

17:01.461 --> 17:02.665
Thank you for your cooperation.

17:04.037 --> 17:05.641
Have a nice day.

17:12.810 --> 17:15.414
- You let him go?
- Only way to save that kid.

17:15.746 --> 17:17.328
And what if you're wrong?

17:28.171 --> 17:29.837
We're clear.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.874
I did what you wanted,
now give me my daughter.

17:36.545 --> 17:38.428
You can take my car.

17:44.179 --> 17:45.506
Drop your gun!

17:54.108 --> 17:55.803
So, our good news first.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.472
Three more fugitives were apprehended,

17:57.509 --> 17:59.476
leaving just two at large.

17:59.532 --> 18:01.288
But those two
are gonna be hell to catch.

18:01.407 --> 18:04.557
Which is why command asked
Jessica Russo to assist us.

18:04.594 --> 18:06.560
- Jessica?
- Yeah, so at this point,

18:06.635 --> 18:08.170
we're gonna have to
assume that these guys

18:08.207 --> 18:10.037
have gotten past the perimeter,
which means

18:10.074 --> 18:12.053
that we're gonna
have to get inside their heads

18:12.185 --> 18:13.691
to figure out where they're gonna go.

18:13.728 --> 18:15.249
Predictive analytics.

18:16.624 --> 18:18.499
- You sound skeptical.
- No, ma'am.

18:18.536 --> 18:20.003
I just found the best way
to catch a criminal

18:20.040 --> 18:22.007
- is to hit the streets.
- Well, that's because you have

18:22.044 --> 18:23.577
no experience doing it any other way.

18:23.709 --> 18:26.418
Marcos Gibson. Only 24 years old,

18:26.491 --> 18:28.756
but he's been a member
of the 54th street gang

18:28.793 --> 18:30.061
for over a decade.

18:30.098 --> 18:32.065
He was recently sentenced
to 12 years in Victorville

18:32.241 --> 18:34.241
for aggravated assault
and attempted murder.

18:34.276 --> 18:36.710
The five-four will do everything
they can to help him get away.

18:36.745 --> 18:38.345
Including spiriting him
out of the state.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.975
I've got a contact inside the five-four

18:40.012 --> 18:41.412
that might be able to
give us some insight.

18:41.448 --> 18:43.617
- Go talk to him.
- Okay, good.

18:43.652 --> 18:46.286
Our next fugitive is Caleb Jost.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.223
He is, in my opinion,
the more dangerous of the two.

18:49.372 --> 18:52.035
He is 44 years old,
a former investment banker.

18:52.233 --> 18:53.929
Sentenced five years
for securities fraud

18:53.966 --> 18:56.049
and another eight
for biting off the nose

18:56.086 --> 18:58.131
of his Deputy AG during his arrest.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.947
He is testament
to the fact that psychopaths

18:59.984 --> 19:02.088
can carry a briefcase
as easily as a grab bag.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.871
The FBI believes Caleb
hid significant resources

19:04.906 --> 19:07.312
- before he was arrested.
- Which he's gonna need

19:07.349 --> 19:08.906
to avoid going back to prison.

19:08.962 --> 19:10.809
So we have to dig into the FBI leads

19:10.845 --> 19:12.545
and figure out the
location of that money

19:12.580 --> 19:14.547
- before he gets there.
- That's exactly right.

19:14.582 --> 19:16.415
Are you up for the challenge,
Officer Nolan?

19:16.451 --> 19:17.750
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay, great,

19:17.785 --> 19:19.566
then you and Officer Bishop
can stay with me

19:19.603 --> 19:22.237
while everybody else runs
down more obvious leads.

19:22.457 --> 19:24.557
Okay? All right, here we go.

19:24.592 --> 19:27.101
Grand theft auto? Really?

19:27.595 --> 19:29.395
I barely made it 100 yards.

19:29.430 --> 19:30.844
There isn't a distance requirement.

19:30.881 --> 19:32.732
You stole a car, which means
we gotta process you

19:32.767 --> 19:34.391
before we ship you back to prison.

19:34.428 --> 19:35.934
Hey, I'm not complaining.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.275
This place is like the Ritz
compared to Victorville.

19:38.312 --> 19:40.451
Get him squared away while I
contact the Sheriff's Department

19:40.488 --> 19:41.840
about procedure.

19:42.145 --> 19:43.441
You know the drill.

19:43.567 --> 19:45.034
Take your shoes off.

19:46.889 --> 19:48.513
West?

19:48.630 --> 19:51.035
I knew a West in my youth.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.851
Percy.

19:54.006 --> 19:55.320
Any relation?

19:55.615 --> 19:57.589
Yeah. He's my dad.

19:58.014 --> 19:59.440
Oh, yeah?

19:59.660 --> 20:01.674
Yeah, I guess I see the resemblance.

20:02.686 --> 20:04.862
You must have got your tall gene
from your moms.

20:05.201 --> 20:06.765
So what, my old man arrested you?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.060
Yeah, well, it was a little bit

20:08.097 --> 20:09.249
more complicated than that.

20:09.286 --> 20:10.435
How so?

20:10.470 --> 20:11.603
Well, this was the '90s.

20:11.638 --> 20:13.271
The streets were different back then.

20:13.307 --> 20:15.607
And your dad was going after
some pretty big players.

20:15.784 --> 20:17.663
He... He didn't always
sweat the small stuff.

20:17.729 --> 20:19.729
So you're saying he let you go.

20:19.765 --> 20:21.239
Uh, yeah, depending on the day.

20:21.275 --> 20:23.447
I'd give him a little Intel.
He'd look the other way.

20:23.482 --> 20:24.949
But not before messing with me.

20:25.411 --> 20:28.286
This one time,
he caught me with some dope.

20:28.601 --> 20:31.208
He told me if I could outrun
him, he'd cut me loose.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.404
- My dad's pretty fast.
- Yeah, we tied.

20:33.778 --> 20:35.492
I was, like, 20 pounds
lighter back then.

20:35.528 --> 20:36.961
And I was high on crank, you know.

20:36.996 --> 20:39.697
I'm sorry, but this does not
sound like my dad.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.999
We were all gangsters back then, son.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.868
Criminals and five-oh alike.

20:44.905 --> 20:46.810
What's predictive analytics?

20:46.847 --> 20:48.947
Using data from the past
to predict the future.

20:49.210 --> 20:50.674
Feds love that kind of stuff.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.031
They'd rather sit
in front of a computer

20:52.067 --> 20:53.844
than hit the streets
and scuff their loafers.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.979
Still, if it helps solve
a crime or find a fugitive,

20:56.014 --> 20:57.187
isn't it worth using?

20:57.224 --> 20:58.390
Whose side are you on?

20:58.427 --> 21:00.817
I didn't know there were sides.
But yours, definitely yours.

21:00.853 --> 21:02.552
- Deacon, thanks for coming in.
- No problem.

21:02.587 --> 21:03.907
I figured I'd be
hearing from you today.

21:04.747 --> 21:06.723
- Hi.
- Hi. Deacon Joe.

21:06.953 --> 21:09.559
- Lucy Chen.
- Bradford's next victim.

21:09.772 --> 21:11.173
I remember when your T.O. was the one

21:11.210 --> 21:13.563
- wearing the long sleeves.
- Oh, you got pictures?

21:13.598 --> 21:15.498
I like her.

21:15.533 --> 21:18.017
I'm thrilled.
Deacon was my first arrest.

21:18.054 --> 21:19.669
Also one of the few to be rehabilitated

21:19.704 --> 21:21.131
in maximum security prison.

21:21.170 --> 21:23.195
Man, I swear to God,
every time I see you,

21:23.232 --> 21:24.674
it's like a time machine.

21:24.790 --> 21:26.775
I mean, since we met,
I did six years in Chino,

21:26.810 --> 21:30.100
got clean, left the life,
started up a family.

21:30.226 --> 21:32.492
Only thing that changed about
you is the lines on your face.

21:32.529 --> 21:34.049
What lines?

21:34.273 --> 21:36.841
If you were expecting to hear from
me, then you know why you're here.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.674
Marcos Gibson.
Look, I need to get to him

21:38.711 --> 21:40.144
before he hooks up with the 5-4.

21:40.181 --> 21:42.255
Yeah, Marcos was one
of my kids for a while.

21:42.323 --> 21:45.002
I lost him to the 5-4.
But they're the last place

21:45.039 --> 21:46.846
- he's gonna go right now.
- Why?

21:46.883 --> 21:48.602
He was knocking boots
with Keon's woman.

21:48.639 --> 21:50.756
- Right before the trial.
- Who's... Who's Keon?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.067
Leader of the 5-4.
This kid must have a death wish.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.537
Yeah, if Keon gets ahold
of Marcos before you guys do,

21:55.931 --> 21:57.131
he'll kill him.

22:00.512 --> 22:02.625
Officer Bishop,
any update on Caleb Jost?

22:02.662 --> 22:04.875
Uniforms have visited
his entire extended family.

22:04.912 --> 22:06.164
No one's seen or heard from him.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.586
If we believe they
are telling the truth.

22:07.623 --> 22:08.936
Exactly.

22:09.486 --> 22:10.952
Um...

22:10.987 --> 22:12.501
Just give me a sec.

22:13.795 --> 22:15.156
Excuse me.

22:15.451 --> 22:17.295
Did you know that deputy who died?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.660
Graham? Yeah.

22:19.695 --> 22:21.629
My condolences. Um...

22:21.664 --> 22:25.197
He asked me to pass a
message along to his wife.

22:25.234 --> 22:26.754
I just need to know how
to get in touch with her.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.469
Graham wasn't married.

22:28.642 --> 22:29.969
Oh, um...

22:30.339 --> 22:32.797
Maybe a girlfriend, then.
Her name is Beth.

22:33.204 --> 22:35.073
Graham was single.

22:35.386 --> 22:38.000
He never even brought a date
to the Christmas party.

22:38.974 --> 22:40.748
- You sure?
- Yeah.

22:41.131 --> 22:42.750
Graham was a bit of a loner.

22:42.952 --> 22:45.085
We, uh...

22:45.365 --> 22:47.771
We, uh, used to give him
a hard time about it.

22:48.521 --> 22:50.590
Okay, um...

22:50.781 --> 22:52.325
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

22:55.279 --> 22:58.279
- Did you find something?
- Oh, um, no.

22:58.318 --> 23:00.834
That was a bit of a side project.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.038
Okay, well, it's not really
an appropriate time for that.

23:03.074 --> 23:05.169
Of course, you're right, but, um...

23:05.535 --> 23:06.834
But what?

23:06.944 --> 23:09.099
I-I was with the deputy when he died.

23:09.169 --> 23:11.898
He asked me to give a message
to someone named Beth,

23:11.935 --> 23:14.681
and now it turns out he's single.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.067
Uh, well, a mom or a sister maybe?

23:19.104 --> 23:22.462
Maybe. It... sounded romantic.

23:23.892 --> 23:25.841
A-Anyway, I should be
getting back to work.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.695
His death must have been
traumatic for you.

23:29.845 --> 23:31.208
I'm fine.

23:31.488 --> 23:32.724
Boom.

23:32.857 --> 23:35.154
Lying destroys rapport, remember?

23:35.544 --> 23:37.003
Right.

23:39.638 --> 23:41.674
His leg was torn off in the accident.

23:41.774 --> 23:43.977
I wasn't expecting to see that.

23:45.584 --> 23:47.803
You know, I will never forget

23:48.383 --> 23:51.341
the first catastrophic
injury that I saw.

23:52.331 --> 23:55.021
But at least you have
something positive to focus on.

23:56.712 --> 23:59.555
If you need any help finding
her, please let me know.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.560
Thank you.

24:01.595 --> 24:02.928
I think I might've found something.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.930
I ran a search of names
from Caleb's life

24:04.965 --> 24:06.598
against recent dispatch calls.

24:06.634 --> 24:08.600
Discovered a wellness check
that was called in

24:08.636 --> 24:10.911
for the aunt of Caleb's ex-wife.

24:11.071 --> 24:12.571
I guess she's a daily churchgoer,

24:12.606 --> 24:13.906
but she didn't show up today.

24:14.033 --> 24:15.741
She could have just gone to the movies

24:15.776 --> 24:17.609
or maybe planned to go later.

24:17.646 --> 24:20.579
Maybe, or her routine was disturbed

24:20.614 --> 24:22.614
by a visit from our fugitive.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.615
Good work, Officer Bishop.
Go check that out.

24:31.701 --> 24:33.457
Prison transport will be here soon.

24:33.591 --> 24:35.852
- Lucky me.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.354
Hey, listen, you see your old man,

24:37.391 --> 24:38.763
tell him I said "hi."

24:38.959 --> 24:40.792
And I haven't forgotten.

24:42.086 --> 24:43.534
Forgotten what?

24:43.747 --> 24:45.046
The .45 he planted.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.438
The reason I'm doin' life in prison.

24:46.477 --> 24:48.014
You're saying that my dad framed you?

24:48.051 --> 24:50.853
Well, no, we were good while
I was informing on guys.

24:51.193 --> 24:53.451
I think he made some
pretty heavy busts.

24:53.609 --> 24:56.080
But when I stopped being useful,

24:56.291 --> 24:58.401
cops found a murder weapon
in my apartment.

24:58.471 --> 25:00.751
Let me guess, for a crime
that you didn't commit.

25:01.223 --> 25:03.120
No. I killed that dude.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.883
It's just there wasn't any evidence.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.107
Not until your daddy
planted that gun on me.

25:08.483 --> 25:10.783
Bet you haven't heard <i> that</i>
story at the dinner table.

25:19.096 --> 25:20.838
Hey, uh, have you seen Lopez?

25:20.924 --> 25:22.498
Oh, uh, yeah, she's in the bullpen

25:22.535 --> 25:24.860
talking to Tim, and I'm just
getting us some fuel

25:24.897 --> 25:26.661
before we hit the street.

25:26.781 --> 25:29.121
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:31.034 --> 25:33.401
No. Um... Look, I-I don't know.

25:33.437 --> 25:36.001
This fugitive we grabbed
has been getting under my skin.

25:36.128 --> 25:38.640
Basically said that my dad was
a dirty cop back in the day.

25:38.675 --> 25:40.342
Your dad? No way.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.936
That guy's just trying
to push your buttons.

25:41.972 --> 25:43.612
- Right?
- Yeah. Commander West is I.A.

25:43.647 --> 25:44.950
- This guy is...
- An ex-drug dealer

25:44.987 --> 25:46.748
who is doing life for murder.

25:48.226 --> 25:50.271
See? Case closed.

25:50.486 --> 25:52.453
Thank you. Uh,
when you put it that way,

25:52.488 --> 25:53.800
I don't even know why I was worried.

25:53.837 --> 25:55.418
Yeah, I mean, your grandma,
on the other hand,

25:55.455 --> 25:57.367
I heard she'd cut a bitch
for a dollar back in the day.

25:57.446 --> 25:58.846
Back in the day? Hell, that woman

25:58.882 --> 26:00.525
will cut a bitch <i> now.</i>

26:00.589 --> 26:03.456
Hey, you, uh... you think I've
changed since you've met me?

26:03.633 --> 26:04.932
You got more annoying.

26:04.968 --> 26:06.934
I'm serious. Have I changed at all?

26:07.303 --> 26:08.913
- Sure.
- How?

26:09.672 --> 26:11.105
What do you mean? You're older.

26:11.141 --> 26:13.606
What you went through with
Isabel certainly changed you.

26:13.694 --> 26:15.793
Made me different,
or just made me more... me?

26:15.830 --> 26:17.460
What's this about?

26:17.867 --> 26:20.467
Just wondering if I've been
treading water a little...

26:20.649 --> 26:22.404
you know, not challenging myself.

26:22.517 --> 26:25.121
Since when does Tim Bradford
do introspection?

26:25.591 --> 26:27.057
- Never mind.
- Hey.

26:27.156 --> 26:28.632
We got a plan of action to find Marcos?

26:28.669 --> 26:30.603
Hit the streets,
sweat some more of his people.

26:30.935 --> 26:32.623
I'll see you later.

26:33.491 --> 26:34.804
Hey, Bradford.

26:34.997 --> 26:37.463
You've also gotten dumber.
Does that count?

26:39.835 --> 26:41.406
What was that about?

26:41.477 --> 26:43.066
Inside joke.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.352
- Hot damn.
- What is it?

26:45.397 --> 26:47.798
Text from Deacon. He's got Marcos.

26:51.489 --> 26:53.012
It's number 2354.

26:53.319 --> 26:55.012
What's Caleb's connection
to this place again?

26:55.049 --> 26:56.765
His ex-wife's aunt lives here.

26:56.802 --> 26:59.069
Was the ex an ex before
he went away to prison or after?

26:59.106 --> 27:00.695
After, I think. What does it matter?

27:00.837 --> 27:02.793
Well, if they were still
married when he went to prison,

27:02.830 --> 27:05.290
there's a good chance
he hid some money here.

27:05.327 --> 27:07.057
Which would give him
reason to come here

27:07.094 --> 27:08.524
after getting through our perimeter.

27:08.602 --> 27:10.090
This is the house.

27:10.631 --> 27:12.064
Okay, tactical recommendation.

27:12.602 --> 27:14.066
Knock or recon?

27:14.142 --> 27:16.068
Recon. This guy bites off noses.

27:16.103 --> 27:17.903
I don't want to get surprised by him.

27:18.142 --> 27:19.417
I'll go low.

27:25.579 --> 27:28.142
Bishop, door jamb's busted.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.892
7-Adam-15,

27:29.929 --> 27:32.081
requesting backup at 2354 Sawyer.

27:32.188 --> 27:35.297
Location of possible fugitive
suspect Caleb Jost.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.048
It's over, Caleb.

28:35.073 --> 28:37.721
You know, I felt a little stupid
taping up Aunt Sallie,

28:37.758 --> 28:39.354
but I'm feeling pretty good
about it now.

28:40.563 --> 28:43.136
Hey! Stay back

28:43.448 --> 28:45.756
or I am repainting the walls
in here crimson.

28:45.792 --> 28:48.778
Come on, Caleb. You're too smart a guy

28:48.815 --> 28:50.388
to be pulling that trigger.

28:50.776 --> 28:52.482
Right now, you're looking
at aggravated assault.

28:52.519 --> 28:54.084
That might add a couple years
to your sentence,

28:54.163 --> 28:56.146
- but if you kill her...
- Stop.

28:56.544 --> 28:59.111
Stop trying to reason with me.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.156
I hate prison.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.395
If I got a shot at not going back,

29:03.622 --> 29:06.306
I'm gonna take it, so back the hell up

29:07.037 --> 29:08.771
and get me someone who can make a deal,

29:08.808 --> 29:10.179
or I am pulling this trigger.

29:20.529 --> 29:21.732
Control,

29:21.769 --> 29:24.867
show us on site at 1115 Amador Street.

29:27.168 --> 29:28.964
Damn it.

29:29.170 --> 29:31.971
5-4 must've heard Marcos
is at Deacon's house.

29:32.418 --> 29:33.591
What do we do?

29:33.628 --> 29:35.786
Keep your cool and
get ready for trouble.

29:43.463 --> 29:44.895
Hello, Officer.

29:45.097 --> 29:46.430
Lovely evening.

29:46.777 --> 29:48.155
Sure is.

29:48.574 --> 29:50.374
What are you guys doing out here?

29:50.426 --> 29:51.724
Oh, you know,

29:51.791 --> 29:53.271
just exercising our
constitutional right

29:53.324 --> 29:54.438
to assemble.

29:55.092 --> 29:57.285
- God bless America.
- Mm-hmm.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.547
Well, I suggest you all
assemble somewhere else.

30:00.981 --> 30:03.002
Is that an order?

30:03.315 --> 30:05.511
Consider it a little friendly advice.

30:06.130 --> 30:09.644
Well, we appreciate you
looking out for us, Officer,

30:09.988 --> 30:11.583
but we ain't going nowhere.

30:14.170 --> 30:15.726
Then maybe I'll see you later.

30:15.794 --> 30:17.319
Count on it.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.344
Control, patch me through to 7-L-20.

30:38.457 --> 30:40.317
7-Adam-19, report.

30:40.352 --> 30:42.484
<i>Yeah, we got a bit of
a situation here, Sergeant.</i>

30:42.520 --> 30:44.547
Approximately 15 gang members

30:44.584 --> 30:46.154
are gearing up
to take out our fugitive,

30:46.191 --> 30:47.656
Marcos Gibson.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.457
Chen and I made it through their lines,

30:49.494 --> 30:51.728
<i>but the 5-4's gonna
come after this guy soon.</i>

30:52.063 --> 30:53.693
I just sent all available units

30:53.730 --> 30:55.998
to Nolan's hostage situation
over in Culver City.

30:56.034 --> 30:58.761
<i>But I will reorient some back to you.</i>

30:59.089 --> 31:01.370
Sir, this is a family neighborhood.

31:01.519 --> 31:04.107
If bullets start flying, a lot
of kids are gonna get hurt.

31:04.652 --> 31:06.449
What are you saying, Bradford?

31:08.506 --> 31:11.112
Have the units stage away
from our location

31:11.149 --> 31:12.782
until overwhelming force arrives.

31:12.957 --> 31:15.394
Anything less than that's
gonna come with a body count.

31:15.558 --> 31:17.786
We'll do our best
with what we got until then.

31:29.001 --> 31:31.302
What are the odds they'll
change their minds and leave?

31:38.927 --> 31:40.474
Oh, come on.

31:47.336 --> 31:48.484
What are we gonna do?

31:48.519 --> 31:50.325
Let's start with you letting us in.

31:53.054 --> 31:54.802
First time I've ever
been happy to see cops.

31:54.839 --> 31:56.000
Hook him up, Boot.

31:56.036 --> 31:57.092
What? Whoa, hang on.

31:57.127 --> 31:58.985
No, you... I gotta keep my hands
free in case I gotta fight.

31:59.021 --> 32:00.782
I hate to break it to you,
but if this gets to fighting,

32:00.818 --> 32:02.258
your hands aren't gonna help.
Turn around.

32:02.579 --> 32:04.342
Turn around. Now.

32:04.430 --> 32:05.653
Can we escape out the back?

32:05.690 --> 32:07.018
No, no, they got guys out there, too.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.313
I saw them when Keon rolled up.

32:08.458 --> 32:10.470
Bring him out!

32:11.626 --> 32:14.251
We know he in there!

32:14.493 --> 32:15.911
We'll be here all night.

32:15.946 --> 32:17.266
Trying to act like
this fool ain't here.

32:17.302 --> 32:18.622
Yo, send that little punk on out!

32:18.658 --> 32:19.970
Bring him out already!

32:20.083 --> 32:22.717
So how does someone go from
financial crimes to this?

32:23.169 --> 32:24.441
I'm an overachiever.

32:25.630 --> 32:26.788
Where's my negotiator?

32:26.988 --> 32:28.222
On the way.

32:28.497 --> 32:29.896
You can talk to me while we wait.

32:31.260 --> 32:32.642
You're a nobody.

32:33.359 --> 32:35.538
I want a <i> somebody</i> with authority.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.801
- How you doing?
- I'm a little stressed.

32:39.836 --> 32:42.903
Only a little? Well, then you're fine.

32:43.088 --> 32:46.077
- Who are you?
- Smart setup.

32:46.327 --> 32:47.908
SWAT can't shoot you
through the windows,

32:47.944 --> 32:49.512
and we can't rush you from the doorways

32:49.549 --> 32:51.067
without you pulling the trigger.

32:51.446 --> 32:53.681
- You my negotiator?
- Nope.

32:57.203 --> 32:58.453
You're not?

32:58.490 --> 33:00.290
No, I'm only here to advise.

33:00.489 --> 33:02.222
Besides, guys like that,

33:02.257 --> 33:04.358
you have to keep off balance.

33:04.777 --> 33:06.077
Well, that wasn't in your book.

33:06.206 --> 33:07.906
Well, I can't give away all my secrets.

33:07.943 --> 33:10.145
- So what do we do here?
- Okay, good question.

33:10.229 --> 33:12.284
So, I re-read Caleb's file
on the way over here.

33:12.328 --> 33:13.600
And?

33:18.608 --> 33:19.973
You don't say much, do you?

33:20.045 --> 33:22.486
If you kill that woman,
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

33:22.978 --> 33:24.304
A lot.

33:26.155 --> 33:27.545
Good to know.

33:27.912 --> 33:30.149
Okay, Caleb. Here's the thing.

33:30.397 --> 33:32.327
After a brief discussion
with my associate,

33:32.364 --> 33:34.298
we've come to the conclusion
that you're full of crap.

33:34.730 --> 33:37.400
You're not suicidal.
You're a narcissist.

33:37.475 --> 33:40.358
Stuck in a chimney,
with no chance for escape.

33:42.287 --> 33:43.953
Hey! Hey! S-Stay back!

33:47.986 --> 33:51.488
The only way you get out
of this room alive

33:51.672 --> 33:55.007
is if you give up... right now.

34:04.358 --> 34:05.517
Get up.

34:07.397 --> 34:09.545
Turn around. Hands behind your head.

34:09.764 --> 34:10.896
Interlace your fingers.

34:11.056 --> 34:13.386
Other one. Come on. Your other hand.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.275
You're under arrest.

34:15.416 --> 34:17.228
That took guts, Officer Nolan.

34:17.705 --> 34:19.898
You said when push comes
to shove, he'd surrender.

34:20.377 --> 34:21.699
Well, yeah. But I could've been wrong.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.502
That's gonna be a lot
of paperwork for you, Boot.

34:31.539 --> 34:33.710
Seriously? That's what
you're thinking about right now?

34:37.043 --> 34:38.148
Hypothetically,

34:38.185 --> 34:40.717
is there ever a scenario
where we just, you know,

34:40.753 --> 34:42.085
g-give them what they want?

34:42.123 --> 34:44.458
Where we, you know, balance one life

34:44.495 --> 34:47.203
against the lives of many lives and...

34:47.626 --> 34:48.982
make that hard call?

34:49.052 --> 34:51.895
Th-That call isn't ours to make.

34:52.105 --> 34:53.443
Look, we're here to serve and protect.

34:53.480 --> 34:56.130
We don't get to decide who
we serve or who we protect.

34:56.341 --> 34:59.069
So you're willing to die for that guy?

34:59.607 --> 35:01.732
I am unwilling to let fear
make me do something

35:01.769 --> 35:03.853
I'll be ashamed of in the light of day.

35:04.013 --> 35:06.375
Whoa, hey, where are you going?

35:06.576 --> 35:08.130
I'm gonna talk.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.242
Damn it.

35:21.826 --> 35:23.124
You stay here.

35:23.161 --> 35:25.094
No matter what happens to me,
you protect him.

35:25.262 --> 35:26.768
I will.

35:29.801 --> 35:32.301
Hey, leave him alone.

35:33.154 --> 35:35.637
You want to beat someone up,
I'm right here.

35:35.763 --> 35:37.477
Only one I want is Marcos.

35:38.013 --> 35:39.941
You give him up, we out of here.

35:39.977 --> 35:42.611
- I can't do that.
- Look, I got no beef with you or Joe.

35:42.646 --> 35:44.513
But that fool in there...

35:44.591 --> 35:46.133
he was creeping with my old lady.

35:46.316 --> 35:47.883
So he gots to get dealt with!

35:47.918 --> 35:49.240
- Yeah, that's right.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

35:49.357 --> 35:50.476
Give up.

35:50.513 --> 35:52.120
You're alone. Outnumbered.

35:56.026 --> 35:58.116
You know, it was pointed out
to me today

35:58.413 --> 36:01.948
that I've been doing patrol
a long time. Maybe too long.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.952
You know, I've seen a lot
of friends move up and on.

36:04.126 --> 36:05.697
Promotions. Other agencies...

36:05.734 --> 36:07.867
- I don't give a damn, Cop.
- Well, you should.

36:07.994 --> 36:09.554
'Cause one thing I've
learned all these years

36:09.591 --> 36:11.549
is that I'm never alone.

36:11.658 --> 36:13.859
And I'm never outnumbered.

36:23.435 --> 36:25.150
You're under arrest.

36:25.287 --> 36:27.132
Turn around, get down on your knees.

36:28.334 --> 36:29.758
Turn around!

36:29.795 --> 36:31.387
Hands behind your head.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.700
Call it in, Boot.

36:40.935 --> 36:43.170
7-Adam-19, last fugitive in custody.

36:43.322 --> 36:44.588
Show us Code 4.

36:54.514 --> 36:56.715
Tell your old man I said hi.

36:56.787 --> 36:58.316
Yeah, I don't think I will.

36:58.448 --> 37:00.352
Why? You afraid of what he might say?

37:00.387 --> 37:01.709
Nope, I just don't want to bother him

37:01.746 --> 37:03.008
with a bunch of nonsense.

37:03.381 --> 37:06.224
Oh, you don't believe me. That's cool.

37:06.259 --> 37:08.691
Every kid should worship their dad.

37:08.834 --> 37:11.764
But if you want to find out
the truth about him...

37:12.123 --> 37:13.670
read my file.

37:16.016 --> 37:17.373
What was that about?

37:17.437 --> 37:19.833
Nothing... I hope.

37:21.256 --> 37:23.077
Your partner's crazy.

37:23.537 --> 37:25.943
Not my partner. She's my T.O.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.389
What the hell does that mean?

37:27.426 --> 37:29.414
Oh, you've got some time
on your hands, Caleb.

37:29.744 --> 37:30.975
Look it up.

37:31.012 --> 37:32.979
- You ready for him, Elizabeth?
- Yeah.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.237
Elizabeth?

37:39.871 --> 37:41.125
Yeah?

37:41.420 --> 37:42.927
Anyone call you "Beth"?

37:44.697 --> 37:46.026
Why?

37:46.443 --> 37:47.900
Did you know Graham?

37:48.014 --> 37:49.367
The deputy who passed away?

37:50.428 --> 37:51.871
Well, yeah.

37:52.339 --> 37:55.098
We... We worked together
for the last five years.

37:56.809 --> 37:58.371
I was with him when he died.

37:58.408 --> 38:00.762
He asked me to pass
a message along to Beth.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.281
What message?

38:03.616 --> 38:06.050
He told me to tell her he loved her.

38:09.059 --> 38:13.124
- You're lying.
- No, that's... the last thing he said.

38:14.809 --> 38:16.827
Is that you? Were you together?

38:18.746 --> 38:20.238
He was, um...

38:21.777 --> 38:23.137
my friend.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.184
There was a time that I, um...

38:27.739 --> 38:29.973
I thought he'd ask me out.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.099
I wanted him to.

38:34.046 --> 38:35.777
He never did.

38:37.650 --> 38:39.817
Well, I think he
regretted that in the end.

38:43.043 --> 38:44.988
I'm sorry for your loss.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.459
Thanks.

38:54.597 --> 38:56.680
You sure you still
want me to come to dinner?

38:56.717 --> 38:59.218
I mean, it's been a bit of a day.

38:59.396 --> 39:02.464
Wife's orders. I bring you
or I don't come home.

39:03.908 --> 39:06.449
- Hey.
- Oh, sorry, I-I can come back.

39:06.486 --> 39:08.523
No. What's on your mind?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.801
I, um...

39:11.838 --> 39:13.988
I was thinking about taking
the sergeant's exam.

39:15.611 --> 39:17.675
- Really?
- You think it's a bad idea?

39:17.712 --> 39:20.013
I think it's about time.

39:20.407 --> 39:22.358
I hear there might be
some openings coming up.

39:24.809 --> 39:26.475
The test is in a couple months.

39:26.547 --> 39:28.524
That means you're gonna cram
a hell of a lot of studying in

39:28.561 --> 39:30.447
to get ready. You up for it?

39:30.485 --> 39:33.034
Otherwise you have to wait
two years for the next exam.

39:33.175 --> 39:35.034
Yeah, I am.

39:35.572 --> 39:37.323
- Thanks.
- No problem.

39:37.489 --> 39:39.455
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

39:44.146 --> 39:45.445
What?

39:45.482 --> 39:47.448
- What do you mean, "What"?
- Oh, come on.

39:47.485 --> 39:48.702
Don't look at me like that.

39:48.739 --> 39:50.173
Hanging my business
out there like that?

39:50.249 --> 39:51.847
- Stop it.
- Whatever.

39:51.929 --> 39:54.663
- I miss pushing your buttons.
- I don't.

39:55.191 --> 39:56.488
Pleasure.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.609
- Hey.
- Hi,

39:58.646 --> 40:00.249
did you... did you ever find her?

40:00.286 --> 40:01.702
Your Beth?

40:02.031 --> 40:03.664
Yeah, I did.

40:03.842 --> 40:05.322
Good.

40:05.599 --> 40:07.989
Uh, y-you know, you were wrong.

40:08.686 --> 40:10.419
Uh, excuse me?

40:10.456 --> 40:12.122
You said there was nothing in my past

40:12.159 --> 40:14.018
to indicate I could connect with people

40:14.055 --> 40:15.755
in high-stress situations.

40:15.845 --> 40:18.100
I mean, obviously, negotiating
with a suicide bomber

40:18.137 --> 40:20.065
is stressful, but, honestly,

40:20.102 --> 40:22.179
you need to try telling
a single mother of four

40:22.216 --> 40:24.317
that her kitchen is delayed
'cause her tile's on backorder.

40:24.354 --> 40:26.483
Or convincing a bank
to give you an extra week

40:26.520 --> 40:28.052
to come up with a mortgage.

40:29.006 --> 40:31.952
I-I guess I-I had never
thought of it that way.

40:32.022 --> 40:33.850
- Well, now you do.
- Yes, I do.

40:37.147 --> 40:38.631
Um...

40:38.667 --> 40:39.944
I'm gonna get going.

40:39.981 --> 40:41.486
- Right.
- Yeah.

40:42.470 --> 40:44.545
Um, sorry.

40:44.685 --> 40:46.619
One last thing.

40:46.771 --> 40:49.607
Could I... get you to sign my book?

40:49.877 --> 40:51.544
I know it's nerdy, but, honestly,

40:51.580 --> 40:53.079
I've... I've never actually met someone

40:53.114 --> 40:54.518
who's written a book before.

40:54.555 --> 40:56.455
- Sure, yes, of course.
- Thank you.

40:56.685 --> 40:57.933
Um...

40:58.198 --> 41:00.316
- I-I need a pen.
- Uh, yes.

41:02.256 --> 41:03.623
Okay, thank you.

41:06.818 --> 41:09.007
Thank you for this.

41:12.796 --> 41:14.120
There you are.

41:14.428 --> 41:15.910
All right.

41:16.264 --> 41:18.231
Have a good night, Officer Nolan.

41:18.438 --> 41:19.738
And good work today.

41:19.773 --> 41:21.482
Thanks. You too.

41:35.768 --> 41:38.035
- Hello?
- Too soon?
