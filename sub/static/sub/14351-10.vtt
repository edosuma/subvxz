WEBVTT

00:06.445 --> 00:09.861
Captain's log, stardate 5784.2.

00:10.032 --> 00:13.531
We are responding to desperate
distress calls from an unknown planet.

00:13.702 --> 00:16.988
My science officer, Mr. Spock,
is unable to account for this

00:17.164 --> 00:19.869
since he reported no signs of life
on the planet.

00:20.042 --> 00:22.035
It is rich in kironide deposits,

00:22.211 --> 00:25.545
a very rare and long-lasting
source of great power.

00:25.715 --> 00:28.632
Are you from the spaceship
Enterprise?

00:32.472 --> 00:34.096
That's right.

00:40.939 --> 00:42.978
Alexander, at your service.

00:43.149 --> 00:46.103
I sing, I dance,
I play all variety of games.

00:46.277 --> 00:51.236
And I'm a good loser. A very good
loser. Please try to bear that in mind.

00:51.491 --> 00:54.326
But now, would you please
accompany me?

00:55.078 --> 00:57.071
Who are the inhabitants
of this planet?

00:57.247 --> 00:59.240
Platonians. I'm sure
you've never heard of us.

00:59.416 --> 01:00.958
Our native star is Sahndara.

01:01.126 --> 01:04.709
Millennia ago, just before it went nova,
we managed to escape.

01:04.879 --> 01:08.296
Our leader liked Plato's ideas.
Plato, Platonius, see?

01:08.467 --> 01:11.005
In fact our present philosopher-king,
Parmen,

01:11.178 --> 01:12.838
sometimes calls us Plato's children,

01:13.013 --> 01:17.924
although we sometimes think of
ourselves more as Plato's stepchildren.

01:18.102 --> 01:21.685
Excuse me,
someone's waiting for you.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.031 --> 01:32.866
Welcome to our republic.
Who among you is the physician?

01:33.034 --> 01:34.409
I am. What's the problem?

01:34.577 --> 01:37.115
My spouse, his leg. Come this way.

01:44.629 --> 01:47.120
What happened to that leg?

01:47.549 --> 01:49.625
I suppose I scratched it.

01:50.385 --> 01:53.469
I don't understand, this should've
been attended to immediately.

01:53.638 --> 01:57.636
Sheer ignorance.
Is there anything you can do?

01:58.518 --> 02:02.302
Well, we're certainly gonna try.
The infection is massive.

02:02.481 --> 02:04.853
Let me give you a hypo
to ease the pain.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.771
- Where?
- In the arm.

02:24.670 --> 02:29.628
Philana, they came to help.
They deserve better than to die.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.386
Alexander, you talk too much.

02:49.988 --> 02:53.487
Space, the final frontier.

02:58.997 --> 03:03.125
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:03.293 --> 03:07.207
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:07.380 --> 03:11.164
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:11.343 --> 03:14.712
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:58.182 --> 04:01.183
Captain's log, stardate 5784.3.

04:01.352 --> 04:05.350
Dr. McCoy is endeavouring to treat the
leader of a strange group of people.

04:05.523 --> 04:07.895
When their planet novaed,
millennia ago,

04:08.068 --> 04:12.611
they transported themselves to Earth
during the time of Socrates and Plato.

04:12.781 --> 04:15.450
After the death
of the Greek civilisation they idolized,

04:15.617 --> 04:16.732
they came to this planet

04:16.910 --> 04:20.326
and created for themselves
a utopia patterned after it.

04:20.956 --> 04:24.122
What is it? What is your prognosis,
doctor?

04:24.292 --> 04:26.415
I'll let you know
when I have the results.

04:26.586 --> 04:27.831
And from now on,

04:28.005 --> 04:31.919
it would be better if I handle
the instruments without your help.

04:36.263 --> 04:38.303
Bones, I can't understand
why a simple cut like that

04:38.474 --> 04:39.636
could become so serious.

04:39.808 --> 04:41.386
Neither do I, but it has.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.936
How do I knock out an infection

04:43.103 --> 04:46.140
when the tricorder doesn't show
any information on Platonius bacteria?

04:47.316 --> 04:49.641
All I can do,
and this is gonna take time,

04:49.819 --> 04:52.773
is to try to match his bugs
with a known strain and hope.

04:57.201 --> 04:59.490
Your Pan is in jeopardy.

05:02.290 --> 05:04.579
It isn't now. I win.

05:04.751 --> 05:08.202
- Well played, Eraclitus.
- Thank you, Dionyd.

05:10.089 --> 05:13.589
This psychokinetic power of yours,
How long have you had it?

05:13.760 --> 05:14.839
Two and a half...

05:16.471 --> 05:18.796
Ever since our arrival here
on Platonius.

05:18.973 --> 05:22.343
- How is the power transmitted?
- Brain waves.

05:22.727 --> 05:25.479
Do these waves cease
while you're asleep?

05:25.647 --> 05:28.138
No, not if they're embedded
in the unconscious.

05:28.316 --> 05:31.021
What about medicine?
Why no doctors?

05:31.194 --> 05:33.685
We haven't had any pressing need
for the medical arts.

05:34.740 --> 05:36.697
You see, while still on Sahndara,

05:36.867 --> 05:39.821
we instituted a mass eugenics
programme.

05:39.995 --> 05:41.193
We're the result.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.161
Pared down to a population of 38,
we're perfect for our utopia.

05:46.710 --> 05:50.578
We're bred for contemplation
and self-reliance.

05:51.048 --> 05:54.215
And longevity.
How old would you say I am?

05:55.135 --> 05:57.259
Don't be afraid. I'm not vain.

05:57.430 --> 06:00.596
- Thirty-five.
- That old?

06:03.227 --> 06:09.396
I stopped ageing at 30. Well, anyway,
you're off by 2000 years.

06:10.777 --> 06:14.110
I'm 2300 years old.

06:15.573 --> 06:18.907
We were married very young.
I was only 117.

06:19.369 --> 06:21.741
And he was 128.

06:22.705 --> 06:25.991
So you see, we scarcely have to
move anymore, let alone work.

06:26.167 --> 06:29.085
- That's why you have no resistance?
- That's right.

06:29.254 --> 06:31.246
A break in the skin
or a cut can be fatal.

06:50.275 --> 06:51.770
Fascinating.

06:52.444 --> 06:55.398
I believe we're experiencing
the psychokinetic manifestations

06:55.572 --> 06:56.948
of Parmen's delirium.

07:04.623 --> 07:07.790
- Scott to Captain Kirk.
- Kirk to Enterprise.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.747
Captain,
we're in the midst of a storm.

07:11.797 --> 07:15.297
No discernible cause.
I've never seen anything like it.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.173
There's 10-scale turbulence
right now.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.757
Emergency gyros
and stabilizers at maximum.

07:21.933 --> 07:24.638
If this keeps up, captain,
we can't last.

07:24.811 --> 07:27.931
Engines at full speed.
Get her out of orbit and into space.

07:28.106 --> 07:31.806
I've tried that, sir. She's locked tight.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.310
Then there's nothing you can do
but batten down and weather.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.519
Right, captain.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.730
Parmen's mind is not... Watch it!

07:39.909 --> 07:42.994
He's not only throwing the furniture,
he's tearing up the Enterprise as well.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.954
Bones, knock him out, fast.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.179
Help! Save me!

08:07.479 --> 08:09.022
Alexander.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.518
- Stand behind me.
- His mind will find me anyhow.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.985
Don't save him. Let him die.

08:19.158 --> 08:21.566
The others will all kill each other
trying to take his place.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.540
- Hurry up with that shot.
- Now, doctor!

08:30.211 --> 08:33.662
I can't breathe. I'm choking.

08:36.801 --> 08:39.672
Bones! Shake him,
break his concentration.

08:58.073 --> 09:00.196
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Scott on the Enterprise.

09:00.367 --> 09:02.905
It's all right, captain.
The turbulence has abated.

09:03.078 --> 09:06.328
Good, I think you'll find
that the orbit lock is broken as well.

09:06.498 --> 09:08.242
Assess damage
and repair whatever's necessary.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.077
Aye, captain.

09:10.252 --> 09:14.416
I don't know how I can ever thank you,
not only for Platonius, but for myself.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.250
No thanks is necessary.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.130
Alexander,
show our guests to the south wing.

09:19.303 --> 09:21.130
Thank you,
we must return to the ship.

09:21.305 --> 09:24.176
I think I'd better wait
until the fever breaks.

09:24.475 --> 09:26.017
Well,

09:26.185 --> 09:28.427
in that case, we'll stay.

09:37.822 --> 09:39.945
Anything you want, just ask me,
anything.

09:40.116 --> 09:41.279
Thank you, Alexander.

09:41.451 --> 09:46.029
Think nothing of it, you saved my life.
Listen, I think I should tell you that...

09:46.247 --> 09:47.623
Tell me what?

09:47.790 --> 09:52.084
Well, just that I never knew
any people like you existed.

09:52.253 --> 09:53.534
Where is everyone?

09:53.713 --> 09:56.335
They're all in chambers, meditating.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.132
Alexander,

09:59.844 --> 10:02.680
are there other Platonians like you?

10:03.723 --> 10:05.467
What do you mean, like me?

10:05.642 --> 10:07.433
Who don't have
a psychokinetic ability.

10:09.980 --> 10:13.230
I thought you were talking
about my size.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.187
Because they make fun of me
for my size.

10:16.612 --> 10:20.111
But to answer your question,
I'm the only one who doesn't have it.

10:20.282 --> 10:21.942
I was brought here
as the court buffoon.

10:22.117 --> 10:23.825
That's why I'm everybody's slave

10:23.994 --> 10:27.328
and I have to be ten places at once
and I never do anything right.

10:27.498 --> 10:29.325
How does one obtain the power?

10:29.500 --> 10:33.996
As far as I know, it just comes to you
sometime after you're born.

10:34.171 --> 10:36.460
They say I'm a throwback.
And I am, and so are you.

10:38.676 --> 10:43.255
- Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
- Don't worry. We're happy without it.

10:47.393 --> 10:49.018
You know, I believe you are.

10:50.688 --> 10:52.230
Listen, where you come from,

10:52.398 --> 10:56.562
are there a lot of people
without the power and my size?

10:58.321 --> 11:05.154
Alexander, where I come from, size,
shape or colour makes no difference.

11:05.704 --> 11:07.992
And nobody has the power.

11:08.873 --> 11:10.700
Nobody?

11:13.044 --> 11:15.666
Somebody wants me.

11:16.131 --> 11:19.714
Captain, it will be very gratifying
to leave here.

11:19.885 --> 11:22.590
That might not be easy
should Parmen die.

11:22.763 --> 11:25.550
- Even if he shouldn't.
- Yes.

11:25.724 --> 11:30.303
This utopia of theirs is one of
the best-kept secrets in the galaxy.

11:30.479 --> 11:33.682
Screening themselves
from our sensors, locking us into orbit.

11:33.857 --> 11:37.606
All this adds up to a pattern.

11:37.778 --> 11:41.396
Jim, my concoction actually worked,
the fever's broken.

11:41.574 --> 11:45.274
And what recuperative powers.
The infection's begun to drain already.

11:45.453 --> 11:48.407
Dr. McCoy, you may yet
cure the common cold.

11:48.581 --> 11:50.657
If there ever was a time
to get out of here, it's now.

11:50.833 --> 11:52.956
Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, come in.

11:54.086 --> 11:55.996
- Scott here, sir.
- Prepare to beam us up.

11:56.172 --> 11:59.541
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
Everything's frozen.

11:59.967 --> 12:01.426
Turbulence hit you that hard?

12:01.594 --> 12:04.132
It's not the turbulence, sir,
damage to the ship is minimal.

12:04.305 --> 12:05.847
What caused it?

12:06.015 --> 12:09.550
I don't know, sir.
And those are the facts.

12:09.727 --> 12:10.926
Did you get up into space?

12:11.104 --> 12:14.105
No, sir, the orbit has locked tighter
than ever.

12:14.274 --> 12:17.809
And subspace communication with
Starfleet, that's completely severed.

12:19.196 --> 12:24.321
All right, Scotty.
I'll handle it down here. Stand by.

12:26.495 --> 12:30.445
Great Pan sounds his horn

12:31.625 --> 12:38.244
Marking time to the rhyme
With his hoof, with his hoof

12:40.134 --> 12:43.419
Forward, forward in our plan

12:44.138 --> 12:48.218
We proceed as we began

12:55.816 --> 12:59.150
- Your Excellency.
- "Parmen" will do.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.989
Philosopher-kings have no need
of titles.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.187
I would like to know why

13:03.366 --> 13:06.735
the ship's instrumentation
and weaponry is frozen.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.951
And why the Enterprise
is locked in orbit.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.455
Captain, please.
You are mistaken, I assure you.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.077
Parmen, I've talked to the engineer
aboard the ship.

13:16.337 --> 13:20.466
We've showed our good faith.
Now you show yours.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.382
- I want the ship released immediately.
- The amenities, captain.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.801
Allow me to remind you
that I am the head of this principality.

13:28.975 --> 13:35.773
Guests do not come barging in here
making demands and issuing orders.

13:38.610 --> 13:42.359
Guests? You don't know
the meaning of the word.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.524
Guests aren't treated
like common prisoners.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.369
Do not take that tone with me.

14:19.736 --> 14:22.405
Kirk to Enterprise.
Acknowledge. Acknowledge.

14:22.572 --> 14:26.273
Enterprise, come in. Enterprise...
I can't raise them.

14:26.451 --> 14:29.902
Obviously, Parmen does not wish
any contact made with the Enterprise.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.864
Well, he may need our medical stores.
Why prevent contact?

14:34.042 --> 14:37.577
To shut out any knowledge of his
brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain.

14:37.754 --> 14:39.546
No, Mr. Spock, one thing for certain.

14:39.714 --> 14:42.288
Parmen is not concerned
with my dignity or safety.

14:42.467 --> 14:46.086
Agreed, captain. And Parmen
would not have treated you so brutally

14:46.263 --> 14:50.640
if he had any intention
of releasing you or the Enterprise.

14:54.521 --> 14:56.229
Where are you going?

14:56.398 --> 15:01.107
I don't know. I don't want to go,
but I can't help myself.

15:26.888 --> 15:30.636
Gentle spacemen.
We are eternally in your debt.

15:30.808 --> 15:34.474
We have some trifles for you. Please
accept them as tokens of our gratitude.

15:34.646 --> 15:37.184
They stem from the very source
of our inspiration.

15:37.857 --> 15:41.309
To our noble captain,
the shield carried by Pericles,

15:41.486 --> 15:44.273
as a symbol of gallant leadership.

15:49.327 --> 15:52.328
To our silent and cerebral
Mr. Spock,

15:52.748 --> 15:56.792
this kithara to pluck music
to soothe his ever-active brow.

16:01.089 --> 16:05.716
And lastly, to the physician Dr. McCoy
who saved Platonius and my spouse,

16:06.387 --> 16:11.677
this ancient collection of Greek cures,
penned by Hippocrates himself.

16:18.399 --> 16:19.977
Has the Enterprise
been released yet?

16:20.568 --> 16:22.644
Captain, wait.

16:22.820 --> 16:25.228
I know what you're thinking.

16:25.406 --> 16:28.193
My humble apologies,
you were badly used.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.072
In my own defence,
allow me to say that my illness

16:31.245 --> 16:33.701
was more profoundly disturbing
than I, myself, realised.

16:34.666 --> 16:37.750
I am sure that you, too,
have been out of sorts

16:37.919 --> 16:41.502
and have been driven
to fits of temper and rage.

16:41.673 --> 16:45.587
Unlike you, however, what I think
and feel, whether for good or ill,

16:45.760 --> 16:47.883
is instantly translated into reality.

16:48.430 --> 16:51.347
So, please,
find it in your heart to forgive me.

16:51.516 --> 16:53.176
Certainly.

16:53.351 --> 16:55.225
Has the Enterprise
been released yet?

16:55.395 --> 16:56.770
It will be shortly.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.682
Then good day,
and thank you for the presents.

17:00.859 --> 17:01.890
Not at all.

17:02.069 --> 17:04.560
But there is one final request.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.569
After my nearly fatal infection,
it has become obvious to us all

17:10.743 --> 17:13.366
that we cannot afford
to be without a skilled physician.

17:13.539 --> 17:17.833
Therefore, we should like you,
Dr. McCoy, to remain.

17:18.002 --> 17:20.290
I'm very sorry, but that's impossible.

17:20.462 --> 17:23.547
Your duties
will be extraordinarily light.

17:23.715 --> 17:27.761
Feel free to read, to meditate,
to conduct research, whatever you like.

17:27.928 --> 17:29.257
You will want for nothing.

17:29.430 --> 17:31.138
The answer is no.

17:31.307 --> 17:32.931
We should like to keep it cordial,

17:33.100 --> 17:36.054
but we are determined
to have you stay, doctor.

17:40.191 --> 17:44.604
- Dr. McCoy saved your life.
- I am losing patience, captain.

17:44.779 --> 17:46.653
And you consider yourself
a disciple of Plato?

17:46.823 --> 17:49.492
We manage live
in peace and harmony.

17:49.659 --> 17:55.080
Whose harmony? Yours?
Plato wanted truth and beauty.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.620
And above all, justice.

17:58.084 --> 17:59.282
My dear Mr. Spock,

17:59.461 --> 18:04.882
I admit that circumstances have forced
us to make a few adaptations of Plato.

18:05.050 --> 18:09.297
But ours is the most
democratic society conceivable.

18:09.471 --> 18:13.516
Anyone can, at any moment,
be or do anything he wishes,

18:13.684 --> 18:19.354
even to becoming ruler of Platonius,
if his mind is strong enough.

18:19.523 --> 18:23.272
And if his mind isn't strong enough,
he gets torn apart like Alexander?

18:23.444 --> 18:25.270
Come now, we are not children.

18:25.696 --> 18:29.397
In your culture,
justice is the will of the stronger.

18:29.575 --> 18:34.154
It is forced upon people by means
of weapons and fleets of spaceships.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.999
Our justice
is the will of the stronger mind,

18:37.375 --> 18:40.494
and I, for one,
consider it a vast improvement.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.503
We don't use our weapons
for the kind brutality you practise.

18:44.674 --> 18:47.212
Farewell, captain.

18:47.844 --> 18:48.875
Come on, McCoy.

18:54.058 --> 18:55.766
McCoy.

18:56.352 --> 19:00.682
I can't move, Jim. They're gonna
keep me here no matter what.

19:00.857 --> 19:03.728
- Leave, please.
- No, you're the doctor.

19:04.110 --> 19:07.028
They don't want to force you. They
need your goodwill. They're trying...

19:07.197 --> 19:09.355
Captain, go while you still can.

19:14.079 --> 19:16.404
We're not leaving
until McCoy is released.

19:16.581 --> 19:19.535
This is not the Enterprise.
You are not in command, captain.

19:19.710 --> 19:21.702
Why even discuss it?
Get rid of them.

19:21.878 --> 19:24.251
Oh, no, my dear,
that might offend the doctor.

19:25.549 --> 19:28.254
You wish to stay? By all means.

19:28.427 --> 19:30.834
You can help us celebrate
our anniversary.

19:31.013 --> 19:35.224
In the process, I hope we can
persuade you to join our tiny republic.

19:35.392 --> 19:39.889
- You won't persuade me.
- I think we will.

20:18.478 --> 20:22.096
- I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum
- Spacemen marching to a drum

20:22.274 --> 20:26.224
We slithe among the mimsy troves
And gyre among the bororgroves

20:35.120 --> 20:38.952
You're not staying, McCoy,
no matter what he tries to...

20:42.711 --> 20:45.629
Being your slave

20:47.049 --> 20:50.133
what should I do

20:50.302 --> 20:53.636
but tend upon the hours

20:53.806 --> 20:59.476
and times of your desire?

20:59.645 --> 21:06.478
I have no precious time
at all to spend,

21:06.652 --> 21:11.694
Nor service to do, till you...

21:11.866 --> 21:15.650
Stop it!
Don't do this to him, Parmen.

21:16.663 --> 21:22.666
McCoy, no matter what
he makes me say or do,

21:22.836 --> 21:25.327
the answer's no.

21:28.174 --> 21:32.042
No, Parmen! Stop it!

21:39.978 --> 21:41.686
Well, doctor?

21:47.694 --> 21:50.020
I have my orders.

21:50.989 --> 21:52.365
As you wish, doctor.

21:58.372 --> 22:03.877
Is this your utopia?
Your grand vision of the future?

22:04.045 --> 22:06.002
You don't even...

22:19.852 --> 22:21.726
We have had enough
of your moralizing.

22:21.896 --> 22:23.770
And we've had too much of yours.

22:23.940 --> 22:25.434
You'll never get me to stay.

22:25.608 --> 22:27.067
You will be happy to stay.

22:27.235 --> 22:31.067
It takes a little time, doctor,
but you will be happy to stay.

24:13.677 --> 24:14.709
He's a Vulcan!

24:16.180 --> 24:18.054
You can't force emotion out of him.

24:18.432 --> 24:22.015
- You must be joking, doctor.
- You'll destroy him.

24:23.854 --> 24:26.310
We can't let him die laughing,
can we?

24:33.197 --> 24:34.692
I beg you...

24:42.123 --> 24:43.997
Spock.

24:46.377 --> 24:47.872
Spock.

24:56.972 --> 25:01.515
Don't let them break you.

25:10.694 --> 25:11.725
Hold on!

25:15.282 --> 25:16.942
Don't...

25:31.590 --> 25:34.426
Parmen, they saved your life.

25:38.264 --> 25:41.550
I'm ashamed to be a Platonian.
Ashamed!

26:00.120 --> 26:02.825
How can you let this go on?

26:35.489 --> 26:36.983
Can you do anything for him?

26:37.158 --> 26:38.652
There's no medicine that can help him.

26:38.826 --> 26:41.282
He'll have to come through this
himself.

26:52.590 --> 26:57.133
I trust they did not injure you too much,
captain.

26:57.512 --> 26:59.967
My muscles are sore, that's all.

27:00.348 --> 27:04.642
The humiliation must have been
most difficult to bear.

27:05.562 --> 27:07.685
I can understand.

27:07.856 --> 27:12.269
The release of emotions, Mr. Spock,
is what keeps us healthy.

27:12.444 --> 27:16.940
- Emotionally healthy, that is.
- That may be, doctor.

27:17.532 --> 27:23.785
However, I have noted that
the healthy release of emotion

27:23.956 --> 27:28.831
is frequently very unhealthy
for those closest to you.

27:31.839 --> 27:36.002
Which just goes to prove that there's
no such thing as a perfect solution.

27:38.095 --> 27:40.088
So it would seem.

27:42.725 --> 27:44.682
- Captain.
- Yes, Spock.

27:45.561 --> 27:49.012
Do you still feel anger
toward Parmen?

27:51.609 --> 27:53.233
Great anger.

27:53.402 --> 27:57.566
- And you, Dr. McCoy?
- Yes, Spock, and hatred.

27:58.533 --> 28:02.696
Then you must release it,
gentlemen,

28:03.246 --> 28:06.282
as I must master mine.

28:07.083 --> 28:10.832
I might have seriously injured you,
captain,

28:11.254 --> 28:13.412
even killed you.

28:13.590 --> 28:19.213
They have evoked
such great hatred in me,

28:20.138 --> 28:23.175
I cannot allow it to go further.

28:25.727 --> 28:27.601
I must

28:28.021 --> 28:29.895
master it.

28:31.316 --> 28:33.024
I must...

28:33.652 --> 28:35.609
...control.

28:43.328 --> 28:44.787
Jim.

28:52.171 --> 28:55.291
This is senseless. I've thought it over.
I'm staying.

28:55.549 --> 28:57.791
- You can't.
- Parmen has promised you'll be safe.

28:57.968 --> 28:59.961
Promised? Parmen?

29:00.137 --> 29:01.548
He'd let us beam up
to the Enterprise

29:01.722 --> 29:03.549
then plunge the ship
back into the atmosphere.

29:03.724 --> 29:05.135
But why? Why trick me?

29:05.560 --> 29:09.225
Because if he killed us outright,
in front of you, you'd retaliate.

29:09.397 --> 29:11.722
You're a doctor,
you have the means.

29:11.899 --> 29:16.360
Bones, I know you're trying
to do the right thing,

29:16.529 --> 29:18.937
but if any one of us escaped,

29:19.115 --> 29:23.327
Parmen knows that Starfleet would
never let this planet go unpunished.

29:23.495 --> 29:27.444
Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay
and you sign our death warrant.

29:27.624 --> 29:31.372
He's right.
I should have warned you.

29:31.878 --> 29:34.998
They were treating you the same way
they treat me. Just like me.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.336
Only you fight them.

29:40.220 --> 29:45.178
All the time, I thought it was me, my
mind that couldn't even move a pebble.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.008
They told me I was lucky
they bothered to keep me around at all,

29:48.187 --> 29:50.144
and I believed them.

29:50.856 --> 29:53.857
The arms and legs
of everybody's whim.

29:54.026 --> 29:57.691
Look down, don't meet their eyes.
Smile. Smile.

29:58.322 --> 30:02.402
These great people,
they were gods to me.

30:02.576 --> 30:05.494
But you showed me
what they really are.

30:05.663 --> 30:11.582
And now I know, don't you see,
it's not me, it's not my size, it's them.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.536
It's them. Them!

30:24.682 --> 30:26.556
- Put it down.
- No, this is the best thing for...

30:26.726 --> 30:27.757
- Put it down.
- No.

30:27.936 --> 30:30.427
- Do what I say. Alexander.
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna cut them.

30:30.605 --> 30:32.811
Parmen first,
and they'll all get infected.

30:32.982 --> 30:36.517
But this time, listen, whatever they say,
don't save them. Let them die.

30:36.695 --> 30:38.355
- Give it to me.
- Let me give them a taste

30:38.530 --> 30:39.644
of what they gave me. Please.

30:39.823 --> 30:42.230
They're gonna kill you, anyway,
you know that.

30:42.409 --> 30:45.612
In that case, what's the point
in you dying too, Alexander?

30:47.247 --> 30:48.907
Give it to me.

30:58.175 --> 31:02.422
That's the first time anybody ever
thought of my life before his own.

31:06.642 --> 31:08.350
I should have told you
when you first came

31:08.519 --> 31:12.848
that they were gonna kill you
because I knew that, but I was afraid.

31:13.232 --> 31:15.640
- I was afraid.
- It's all right.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.686
It's all right, Alexander.

31:18.863 --> 31:21.864
Listen, we haven't given up.

31:22.033 --> 31:25.283
And there may be something
you can do to help.

31:27.121 --> 31:29.577
- Anything I can do, you just tell me.
- All right.

31:29.749 --> 31:33.450
Did the Platonians
always have this power?

31:34.045 --> 31:37.544
- No, not until we came to this planet.
- Alexander.

31:37.715 --> 31:41.796
Is it possible for you to recall
how long after you arrived here

31:41.970 --> 31:43.761
that their power began to develop?

31:43.930 --> 31:45.389
How could I forget that?

31:45.557 --> 31:47.964
It was exactly six months
and 14 days after we got here

31:48.143 --> 31:50.052
that they started
pushing me around.

31:50.228 --> 31:53.146
Would you know how many months'
supplies you brought with you?

31:54.441 --> 31:58.106
- Four, I think. No, three.
- That's close enough, Alexander.

31:58.278 --> 32:01.398
Fascinating. Their power developed
two or three months

32:01.573 --> 32:03.945
after they started eating
the native foods.

32:05.410 --> 32:06.442
That's right.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.158
Then it is logical to assume
that there is a connection

32:09.331 --> 32:13.661
between the psychokinetic power
and the eating of the native foods.

32:14.044 --> 32:17.294
Well, then, why wouldn't Alexander
have the same power as the others?

32:17.464 --> 32:20.964
Perhaps his system
cannot absorb the crucial element.

32:21.135 --> 32:24.302
Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you
took a reading of Alexander's blood.

32:26.182 --> 32:29.800
Not that I'm afraid or anything,
but will it hurt much?

32:29.977 --> 32:31.804
You won't even know it happened.

32:31.979 --> 32:34.897
You still have a tricorder reading
of Parmen's blood, don't you?

32:35.066 --> 32:39.016
Of course, Parmen possesses the
highest order of psychokinetic ability

32:39.195 --> 32:42.529
and Alexander the lowest,
in the same environmental conditions.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.490
The probabilities are
that Alexander was born

32:44.659 --> 32:48.526
with some biochemical deficiency
relative to Platonius.

32:48.705 --> 32:50.282
I'll run both their blood samples
through

32:50.457 --> 32:52.864
for a full comparative test
in the tricorder.

32:53.043 --> 32:56.542
And if our theory works out,
we've got a weapon.

32:58.965 --> 33:02.631
The one significant difference between
Parmen's blood and Alexander's

33:02.803 --> 33:06.752
is the concentration of kironide
broken down by pituitary hormone.

33:07.391 --> 33:11.223
Kironide. It's a high energy source.
That could be it.

33:11.395 --> 33:14.515
The pituitary hormones
confirm the hypothesis.

33:14.690 --> 33:16.682
They also regulate body growth.

33:17.234 --> 33:18.812
You mean,

33:18.986 --> 33:23.114
the same thing that kept me from
having the power made me a dwarf?

33:23.282 --> 33:28.110
Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen
kept this little utopia a secret.

33:28.579 --> 33:31.580
Anyone coming down here
and remaining long enough

33:31.749 --> 33:32.947
would acquire the power.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.288
Exactly.

33:35.127 --> 33:37.500
McCoy, there must be a quick way

33:37.672 --> 33:40.708
of building up a concentration
of kironide in our blood.

33:40.883 --> 33:42.461
It'll takes some doing,
but it's possible.

33:42.635 --> 33:44.509
What are we waiting for?

33:54.355 --> 33:55.766
What is it, Bones?

33:55.940 --> 33:58.229
Well, even if the kironide
reaches its desired effect,

33:58.401 --> 34:00.773
it still may not help us
get out of here.

34:00.945 --> 34:04.065
- Yes, there are 38 of them.
- The point is well taken.

34:04.240 --> 34:07.241
However, the psychokinetic power
is not additive.

34:07.410 --> 34:10.993
If it were, considering
the Platonians' hostile propensities,

34:11.164 --> 34:14.616
two or three of them would have
combined forces centuries ago

34:14.793 --> 34:15.908
and deposed Parmen.

34:16.085 --> 34:17.628
He's right.

34:17.795 --> 34:19.456
You know, Parmen says
that each one

34:19.630 --> 34:21.125
has his own separate
power frequency.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.422
Because before when they tried
to combine their powers

34:23.594 --> 34:25.302
and use them together,
it never worked.

34:26.597 --> 34:29.431
- I'm ready.
- Let's not waste any time.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.264
Give us double the concentration
in Parmen's bloodstream.

34:33.437 --> 34:35.097
The time factor concerns me.

34:35.272 --> 34:37.478
It may take days or even weeks

34:37.650 --> 34:41.398
before there's enough build-up from
the kironide to be of any benefit to us.

34:41.570 --> 34:43.313
Yes.

34:44.532 --> 34:46.571
What about Alexander?

34:47.284 --> 34:50.451
Since the kironide's broken down and
injected directly into his bloodstream,

34:50.621 --> 34:52.364
it should work on him as well as us.

34:52.540 --> 34:54.496
Better, in fact,
because he's acclimated.

34:54.667 --> 34:58.535
Oh, no. No.
Not after what they've done to me.

34:58.713 --> 35:01.797
Why not? You could
conceivably take Parmen's place

35:01.966 --> 35:03.295
and run the whole planet.

35:04.719 --> 35:07.839
You think that's what I want?
To become one of them?

35:08.014 --> 35:09.758
Become my own enemy?

35:09.933 --> 35:13.883
Just lie around like a big blob of
nothing and have things done for me?

35:14.062 --> 35:15.342
I want to move around for myself.

35:15.522 --> 35:18.013
If I'm gonna laugh or cry,
I wanna do it for myself.

35:18.191 --> 35:20.813
You can keep your precious power.

35:20.986 --> 35:25.695
All I ask is one thing. If you do make it
out of here, take me with you.

35:25.866 --> 35:29.365
Just drop me anyplace where they
never heard of kironide or Platonius.

35:29.536 --> 35:31.280
Alexander.

35:39.546 --> 35:41.041
Nurse.

35:41.715 --> 35:43.507
Lieutenant Uhura.

35:57.857 --> 36:02.602
I guess we weren't
sufficiently entertaining.

36:24.259 --> 36:25.587
Are we ever glad to see you.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.252
We were forced in the transporter
and beamed down.

36:28.430 --> 36:30.755
It was like
becoming someone's puppet.

36:30.932 --> 36:35.725
I thought I was sleepwalking.
I mean, I couldn't stop myself.

36:37.689 --> 36:41.141
Captain, what is it?
What's going on?

36:43.904 --> 36:46.110
Spock, do you feel any effect
of the kironide shot?

36:46.281 --> 36:49.199
I did experience a slight flush,
captain.

36:49.368 --> 36:51.444
So did I. Let's try a simple test.

36:51.620 --> 36:55.404
Concentrate
on raising this plate of fruit.

37:03.466 --> 37:04.960
Nothing.

37:19.983 --> 37:23.933
Fellow academicians,
2500 years ago,

37:24.112 --> 37:29.319
a band of hardy vagabonds arrived
on this barren, rough-hewn planet.

37:29.576 --> 37:32.660
It was a desperate hardship,
of back-breaking toil,

37:32.829 --> 37:37.622
and then a divine providence
graced our genius and our dedication

37:37.793 --> 37:39.417
with the power of powers,

37:39.586 --> 37:44.129
and through it our every need
instantly materialised.

37:44.299 --> 37:48.795
We thereupon determined
to form a Utopian Brotherhood.

37:48.971 --> 37:50.631
This night is indeed
a festive occasion,

37:50.806 --> 37:53.641
for tonight we welcome
into that brotherhood

37:53.809 --> 37:55.802
its first new member.

37:56.854 --> 38:01.183
Not yet, Parmen.
You have to convince the doctor first.

38:02.943 --> 38:05.269
They'll never do it, Jim.

38:05.571 --> 38:10.316
Doctor, please, you have destroyed
the festive mood of the ladies.

38:10.493 --> 38:12.865
We must recapture it at once.

38:13.371 --> 38:14.995
I know.

38:15.164 --> 38:19.873
What would be better than a serenade
from the laughing spaceman?

38:34.726 --> 38:39.103
Take care, young ladies
And value your wine

38:41.274 --> 38:45.402
Be watchful of young men
In their velvet prime

38:47.531 --> 38:52.027
Deeply they'll swallow
From your finest kegs

38:53.870 --> 38:58.996
Then swiftly be gone
Leaving bitter dregs

39:04.548 --> 39:06.541
Bitter dregs

39:08.636 --> 39:12.799
With smiling words
And tender touch

39:14.809 --> 39:19.056
Man offers little
And asks for so much

39:21.607 --> 39:25.819
He loves
In the breathless excitement of night

39:27.864 --> 39:33.783
Then leaves with your treasure
In cold morning light

39:40.043 --> 39:43.459
In cold morning light

39:50.303 --> 39:53.470
Now let the revels begin.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.515
How faithless and fickle.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.221
Make up your minds.

40:42.357 --> 40:46.105
I'm so ashamed.
Please, make them stop.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.475
We have tried.

40:50.156 --> 40:53.490
Please, please make them stop.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.035
I haven't the power.

41:06.173 --> 41:07.583
I'm deeply sorry.

41:09.259 --> 41:10.422
We've failed you.

41:12.930 --> 41:16.096
For so long
I've wanted to be close to you.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.757
Now all I want to do
is crawl away and die.

41:29.405 --> 41:33.189
Careful, Mr. Spock,
too much love is dangerous.

41:34.910 --> 41:38.908
Remember,
Cupid's arrow kills Vulcans.

41:45.087 --> 41:49.963
I'm so frightened, captain.
I'm so very frightened.

41:50.134 --> 41:54.595
That's the way they want you to feel.
It makes them think that they're alive.

41:55.682 --> 41:56.761
I know it.

41:58.226 --> 42:02.603
But I wish I could stop trembling.

42:02.772 --> 42:05.809
Try not to think of them.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.278
Try.

42:20.415 --> 42:22.289
I'm thinking...

42:23.460 --> 42:25.500
I'm thinking
of all the times on the Enterprise

42:25.671 --> 42:26.833
when I was scared to death.

42:30.592 --> 42:34.127
And I would see you
so busy at your command,

42:34.972 --> 42:38.922
and I would hear your voice
from all parts of the ship,

42:39.727 --> 42:41.803
and my fears would fade.

42:41.979 --> 42:44.731
And now they're making me tremble.

42:46.233 --> 42:48.522
But I'm not afraid.

42:49.528 --> 42:52.732
I am not afraid.

43:10.842 --> 43:13.298
Parmen, let's get on with it.

43:13.470 --> 43:17.847
You are so impatient, my wife.
Observe the doctor and learn.

43:18.016 --> 43:22.014
He's quite content to wait
for the pièce de résistance.

43:57.556 --> 43:59.845
You're half dead, all of you.

44:01.727 --> 44:03.685
You've been dead for centuries.

44:05.106 --> 44:07.893
We may disappear tomorrow,
but at least we're living now.

44:08.067 --> 44:10.274
And you can't stand that, can you?

44:10.445 --> 44:14.063
You're half crazy because
there's nothing inside. Nothing!

44:14.240 --> 44:18.949
And you have to torture us
to convince yourselves you're superior.

44:51.612 --> 44:54.281
Stop it, Parmen! Stop it!

44:54.448 --> 44:58.280
I'll do whatever you want me to do,
I'll stay here and serve you, but stop it!

45:02.289 --> 45:03.914
Parmen.

45:04.083 --> 45:05.114
Alexander again.

45:06.794 --> 45:11.955
He likes to play with knives.
Very well, we shall indulge him.

45:45.417 --> 45:46.448
Who did that?

45:51.340 --> 45:53.665
- I did.
- Impossible!

45:53.842 --> 45:58.255
Quite possible. And logical.

46:01.350 --> 46:03.473
- What is this?
- What's going on?

46:03.644 --> 46:08.353
Platonians, listen to me. The next one
of you that tries any trick will get hurt.

46:08.524 --> 46:10.813
Not only do we have
your psychokinetic ability,

46:10.985 --> 46:13.024
but at twice your power level.

46:13.195 --> 46:15.153
Not twice mine.

46:42.517 --> 46:44.011
Captain, no!

46:44.769 --> 46:46.014
Captain.

46:49.566 --> 46:52.318
I beg of you, I'll do anything you say.

46:52.486 --> 46:54.194
I do not wish to die.

46:59.159 --> 47:02.908
Captain? Do you hear me?

47:05.499 --> 47:08.037
Don't stop me. Let me finish him off.

47:11.088 --> 47:12.203
Do you want to be like him?

47:36.864 --> 47:41.491
Parmen, listen to me. I could have had
your power, but I didn't want it.

47:41.661 --> 47:44.662
I could have had your place
right now.

47:44.831 --> 47:49.327
But the sight of you
and your Academicians sickens me.

47:49.502 --> 47:50.534
Despite your brains,

47:50.712 --> 47:54.081
you're the most contemptible things
that ever lived in this universe.

48:02.975 --> 48:04.718
Captain.

48:05.769 --> 48:10.146
You knew that I intended to
destroy both you and the Enterprise.

48:10.315 --> 48:12.189
Yet you spared me.

48:12.985 --> 48:15.820
To us, killing is murder,
even for revenge.

48:15.988 --> 48:17.897
But there will be other starships...

48:18.073 --> 48:21.941
Well, there's no need for concern.
They'll be safe.

48:22.119 --> 48:23.697
Of late I have begun to think

48:23.871 --> 48:25.864
that we have become bizarre
and unproductive.

48:26.040 --> 48:30.868
We are existing merely to nourish our
own power, it's time for some fresh air.

48:31.045 --> 48:33.168
We shall welcome
your interstellar visits.

48:33.339 --> 48:34.418
I don't believe you.

48:34.590 --> 48:36.832
That would be
highly uncharacteristic.

48:37.009 --> 48:38.338
We must expect, Parmen,

48:38.511 --> 48:41.180
that the moment we leave here,
your fear would be gone.

48:41.347 --> 48:43.838
And you would again be as sadistic
and as arrogant

48:44.017 --> 48:46.305
as your 2500 years have made you.

48:46.477 --> 48:49.846
And just remember, we can recreate
that power in a matter of hours.

48:50.023 --> 48:51.731
So don't try anything.

48:55.612 --> 48:57.604
Understood, captain.

48:58.031 --> 49:01.945
And you're right,
none of us can be trusted.

49:02.118 --> 49:06.282
Uncontrolled, power
will turn even saints into savages.

49:06.456 --> 49:09.790
And we could all be counted upon
to live down to our lowest impulses.

49:09.960 --> 49:13.210
You're very good
at making speeches, Parmen.

49:13.380 --> 49:17.164
Just make sure
that this one sinks in.

49:17.593 --> 49:19.419
Now, move aside.

49:23.599 --> 49:25.223
Alexander.

49:29.313 --> 49:32.729
Kirk to Enterprise.
Mr. Scott, prepare to beam us up.

49:32.983 --> 49:35.439
I have a little surprise for you.

49:35.611 --> 49:38.280
I'm bringing a visitor aboard.
