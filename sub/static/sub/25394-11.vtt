DARIUS: A massive, magnetic
cannon that will fire a series

00:09.096 --> 00:10.662
of hypersonic bullets
at the asteroid,

00:10.706 --> 00:11.924
knocking it off course.

ALYCIA:
What, are you here to gloat?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.320
To offer you a deal.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.714
Why the hell would I help you
with anything?

00:18.757 --> 00:21.151
Because, for once,
you and I are on the same side.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.197
How can you trust her
after everything she's done?

00:23.240 --> 00:26.026
I don't. Miss Vrettou won't be
venturing outside her cubicle.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.506
Not to mention, an ankle
bracelet for insurance.

00:28.550 --> 00:29.725
Anyone home?

00:29.768 --> 00:31.901
Oh, my God. Baby!

00:31.944 --> 00:33.555
Hello?

00:33.598 --> 00:35.035
Congratulations.
I see your daughter is home.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.037
It would be a shame
if something happened to her.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.170

with me tomorrow.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.693
Oh, my God,
you're pregnant.

00:49.614 --> 00:50.789
Can you accept

00:50.833 --> 00:52.878

a purpose?
I can.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.445
Have you tried unburdening?

00:54.489 --> 00:56.621
It's what our

00:56.665 --> 00:58.754

truly accepted the end.

01:12.768 --> 01:15.640
I told you.
Darius really has a plan.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.209
We won't be
prisoners anymore.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.261
Telemetry is nominal.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.915
Hell yeah!

02:15.613 --> 02:18.181
Now that is a shot

02:49.995 --> 02:52.041

02:53.521 --> 02:54.652
REPORTER:
Mr. President, over here.

02:54.696 --> 02:55.871
REPORTER 2: President Tanz?Yes, Ally.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.351
What does that
mean exactly?

02:57.394 --> 02:59.048
How hopeful are you
as to the outcome

02:59.091 --> 03:00.615
of these projects?

03:00.658 --> 03:03.705
Uh, projections indicate
a 94% success rate.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.794
Right now, we have
every reason to believe

03:05.837 --> 03:07.622
that Planet Earth
has been saved--

03:07.665 --> 03:10.015
from the asteroid,
not from ourselves.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.669
That part I haven't
figured out yet.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.237
President Tanz,
some say the rail gun

03:14.281 --> 03:15.847
is a lot of
sound and fury

03:15.891 --> 03:17.284
signifying nothing.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.850
It's fake news designed
to give the public

03:18.894 --> 03:20.200
false hope.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.723
Some say the moon landing
was faked

03:21.766 --> 03:23.464
and Bigfoot
roams the wilderness.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.030
That is fake news.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.945
The rail gun

03:26.989 --> 03:29.296
gives us real hope
for our future.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.514
The future
is a trap.

03:30.558 --> 03:34.605
I am the first,
but others will follow.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.744

03:42.787 --> 03:44.789
what... is...

03:44.833 --> 03:47.009

the President out of here now.

Listen,

03:56.801 --> 03:59.282
they've been told it's a matter
of national security.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.458
Okay, thanks, Alonzo.
Keep me posted.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.721
Anything?Alonzo put an APB

04:03.765 --> 04:05.332
out on Zoe and Jillian,
and he's gone

04:05.375 --> 04:07.072
to every COPE center
in the area.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.683
State and local authorities
are on notice

04:08.726 --> 04:10.293

unusual activity.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.991
I tore her room apart,
called all her friends, nothing.

04:13.035 --> 04:16.908
They're on the TSA watch list.
They can't get on a plane,

04:16.952 --> 04:18.345
so they couldn't
have gotten far.

04:18.388 --> 04:19.737

how Jillian

04:19.781 --> 04:21.391

Who the hell is Nate?

04:36.450 --> 04:40.889

show up for work today, sir.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.235
pretty troubling indicators

06:50.279 --> 06:51.846
from his camp.
Now, we've been tracking

06:51.889 --> 06:53.630
the sales of automatic
and semiautomatic weapons

06:53.674 --> 06:55.589
since Bennett's
takeover attempt,

06:55.632 --> 06:58.983
and we noticed a recent spike
in these areas.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.551
Now every single one
of these hotspots

07:01.595 --> 07:03.466
corresponds to
a COPE headquarters.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.728
We dug deeper,

07:04.772 --> 07:06.556
found the security companies
buying firepower

07:06.600 --> 07:09.385
are actually shell corporations

07:13.302 --> 07:14.477

deal's off the table.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.261
Carter.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.697
MAN:
Detective Carter,

10:54.741 --> 10:57.134
this is Sheriff Watkins
of Calvert County.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.354
Got your number
from D.C. dispatch.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.095
Hey, Sheriff.
Tell me some good news.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.401
We got some calls about a lot of
out-of-towners showing up here,

11:03.445 --> 11:04.925
middle of the night,
D.C. plates.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.361
I don't know
if it means anything.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.710
You got an address for me?

11:10.800 --> 11:14.369
"Hi, everyone. I am home.

11:14.412 --> 11:19.635
Need 411 on COPE,
whereabouts Bass Shepherd."

11:19.679 --> 11:21.289
Tell them how urgent it is.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.204
I have to proceed carefully.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.945
If they think I'm working
for the U.S. government,

11:24.988 --> 11:26.120
they'll assume
I'm a narc.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.904
This is no time for subtlety.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.385
A man died this morning
right in front of me.

11:30.428 --> 11:36.217
I mean, if Bass can pull his
strings then he can do it to...

11:36.260 --> 11:39.133
Jillian.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.439
That's what this
is about, right?

11:47.141 --> 11:48.795
Alonzo, what do we know?

11:48.838 --> 11:52.581
I'm at a compound,
Calvert County, Maryland,

11:52.624 --> 11:54.757
outside Friendship Hills.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.412
I just sent you the address.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.283
Hang on.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.591
All right, I need eyes
on this address.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.202
1437 Edge Road,
Friendship Hills.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.204
Yes, sir.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.512
Bring up satellite footage
for the last 24 hours.

12:13.123 --> 12:16.083
Hold it. Play from
there. Go in tighter.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.041
As tight as you can.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.871
There!

12:21.915 --> 12:23.481
That's Zoe.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.875
HARRIS:
And Bass Shepherd.

12:29.313 --> 12:30.793
DARIUS:
Bass left.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.317
But Zoe and Jillian
are in there.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.015
HARRIS: Alonzo, get the locals
to set up a perimeter,

12:35.058 --> 12:36.756
but do not approach.Carter.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.325
Scramble the enhanced SWAT
and the CNU.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.718
I'll take the chopper there.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.068
I'm coming with you.Wait, Grace.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.591
Do you think
that's a good idea?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.550
If Zoe's in there, then...

12:48.593 --> 12:49.725
Then Harris and
a team of specialists

12:49.769 --> 12:51.161
will get her out safely.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.772
There's not a whole lot
you can or should do.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.774
Zoe's pregnant.

12:56.210 --> 13:00.257
Harris's son is...
was the father.

13:00.301 --> 13:03.130
Wait, you and Harris...?

13:03.173 --> 13:05.349
Are gonna be family.

13:07.656 --> 13:11.442
Darius, my daughter
is everything to me.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.227
I got to go.

13:22.192 --> 13:26.022
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to our celebration.

13:26.066 --> 13:29.852
Bass wanted to be here with us
for this very special occasion,

13:29.896 --> 13:31.332
but we aren't disappointed

13:31.375 --> 13:32.681
because...

13:32.724 --> 13:34.857
We accept.
We accept.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.512
Nora, when do we find out
what Celebration Day is?

13:37.555 --> 13:41.255
Soon. Very, very soon.

14:02.711 --> 14:05.061
Sheriff, cover me.
I'm going in.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.715
The feds are
on their way.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.630
You don't have jurisdiction
here, Detective.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.632
Jurisdiction, my ass.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.721
We may have a mass suicide
on our hands.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.810
Look, I don't see
any guards down there.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.421
It doesn't look like
a hostage situation.

14:17.465 --> 14:20.860
If anyone's going in
there, it's my people.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.166
I know two of the girls
in there, Zoe and Jillian.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.038
I'm less likely
to set anything off.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.737
I'll take that as a yes.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.348
Damn it.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.484
Everyone.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.358
Oh, you can take a sip
to celebrate.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.668
To Celebration Day.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.104
ALL:
To Celebration Day.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.502
Shh.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.340
What is going on?

15:06.383 --> 15:07.776
I-I have no idea.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.082
Nora, what are you doing?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.561
I'm making sure you're safe.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.607
All right, everyone,
you know the drill.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.436
Stay down, quiet
and out of sight.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.481
Come on.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.755
Hello, there.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.975
Hey.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.717
Detective Alonzo Carter.
D.C. Police.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.588
Look, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.895
Looking for a missing person.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.462
Zoe Barrows.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.029
Hmm.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.639
Thought perhaps you might know
where she is.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.989
I don't know anyone
by that name.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.382
Damn.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.601
So sorry to be rude,

15:50.645 --> 15:53.126
but we're actually in the middle
of a private party.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.823
Of course. No problem.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.694
Okay, great.
Ooh.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.655
Is there a Jillian Hayes here,
by any chance?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.488
Yes. Yes, there is.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.665
Would you like to come in?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.884
Definitely.
Okay.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.936
Jillian, I want to leave.I hear you.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.026
Let's just wait till
whatever this is is over

16:24.070 --> 16:25.854
and then I will...
I'll get you home.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.029
Okay? I promise.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.162
Whoa.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.163
Stay here.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.599
No. Jillian.
Zoe.

16:31.642 --> 16:32.992
Jillian.
Shh.

16:36.430 --> 16:39.911
Oh, my God.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.348
He had a gun.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.350
Oh, my God.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.352
Detective Carter. Oh.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.616
What did you do?

16:48.659 --> 16:50.661
What I had to do
to keep you safe.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.519
Harris Edwards,
Secretary of Defense.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.869
Who's in charge here?That'd be me,
Mr. Secretary.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.176
Special Agent Kevin Boyce,
Critical Response.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.786
Director Davis told us
you were en route.

17:28.830 --> 17:29.831
What happened here?

17:29.874 --> 17:30.962
A cop went in to investigate.

17:31.006 --> 17:31.963
There was a gunshot.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.617
He didn't come back out.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.097
Gunshot?

17:35.141 --> 17:36.316
Oh, my God.
What cop?

17:36.359 --> 17:38.796
D.C. Metro-- a Detective
Alonzo Carter.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.712
Grace, no, no.
That's insane.I'm going in there.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.106
We have crisis negotiators
trained for...
I don't see
any negotiating.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.413
Listen, they are armed, Ms....

17:46.456 --> 17:48.197
Barrows. Grace Barrows,
Senior Advisor to the President.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.939
Look, my pregnant daughter
is in there.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.506
Just let me try
to communicate with them.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.116
If they hear my voice...

17:54.160 --> 17:56.205
Grace, let these
people do their jobs

17:56.249 --> 17:58.294
so no one gets hurt.

17:58.338 --> 18:01.863
Harris, what the hell
is happening in there?

18:07.042 --> 18:09.305
Oh, God. Alonzo.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.698
Why would you shoot him?

18:10.741 --> 18:11.873
It was self-defense.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.309
Alonzo, I'm so sorry.

18:13.353 --> 18:17.008
This man is gonna die if he
doesn't get to the hospital.

18:17.052 --> 18:20.142
We need to surrender
to those officers out there.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.884
Bass told us to expect distrust.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.929
We are experiencing that
firsthand right now.

18:24.973 --> 18:28.368
Those people are dangerous
and we will not capitulate.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.588
Fine. You can stay
in here if you want.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.720
I'm taking him
out there with me.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.548
Uh-uh.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.027
Zoe, you are a guest here.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.812
You should start
acting like one.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.729
DAVIS:
Bass Shepherd is everywhere,

18:41.772 --> 18:43.905
up until last night.
Hundreds of hits.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.515
Man never met a camera
he didn't love,

18:45.559 --> 18:47.213
and then poof.What, he vanished?

18:47.256 --> 18:49.084
Yeah, just like
a magic trick.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.695
Highway Patrol got this
still frame of his vehicle

18:51.739 --> 18:53.567
entering a tunnel
in Maryland last night.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.743
He was not in the car when
it came out the other side.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.092
Now, he could've
changed vehicles.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.095
He could-- Mr. President,
I am sorry.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.445
He's disappeared
and we have nothing.

19:05.144 --> 19:09.583
No. The disappearance
is everything.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.324
BOYCE: COPE members,
we are here to help.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.109
We don't want to harm anyone.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.633
Is there a representative
that we could talk to?

19:16.677 --> 19:19.767
I repeat, we do not
want to harm anyone.

19:19.810 --> 19:23.379
This is the third overture.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.034
How long are we gonna wait?
What if they never respond?

19:26.077 --> 19:27.949
Next step, we cut off
their utilities, ma'am.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.517
[vehicle approaches,
man speaks indistinctly]

19:30.560 --> 19:31.953
No, no, no.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.435
Ah.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.004
Yes, we got a bite.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.314
Oh-ho!

19:45.358 --> 19:47.969
Any interest in Bass Shepherd's
personal server?

19:48.012 --> 19:50.145
We just hit
the mother lode.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.627
More like overload.
Where do we start?

19:53.670 --> 19:55.194
With the money.
Bass Shepherd pulled off

19:55.237 --> 19:56.934
an impressive disappearing
act last night,

19:56.978 --> 19:59.154
a carefully executed plan,
and where there's a plan,

19:59.198 --> 20:02.723
there's a paper trail
and deep pockets.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.378
It always comes down to
money one way or another.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.989
Hey, uh, Tess, can we see
Bass Shepherd's bank statements

20:08.032 --> 20:09.251
and financial transactions

20:09.295 --> 20:10.296
from the past
30 days, please?

20:10.339 --> 20:13.299
TESS:
Yes, Liam.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.474
There.

20:14.517 --> 20:17.041
A $5 million payment

20:17.085 --> 20:19.479
to Elite Shelter Corp.

20:19.522 --> 20:22.569
That's one of those luxury
bunker survival complexes.

20:22.612 --> 20:23.918
This doesn't look
like the portfolio

20:23.961 --> 20:25.659
of a man planning
to kill himself.

20:25.702 --> 20:28.096
Well, then if Celebration Day
isn't a mass suicide,

20:28.139 --> 20:30.316
then what is it?

20:34.015 --> 20:35.495
Harris.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.931
HARRIS:
Any sign of Bass?

20:36.974 --> 20:39.063
No. Do you have eyes
inside the compound?

20:39.107 --> 20:40.543
Not yet, they blacked out
the windows,

20:40.587 --> 20:42.023
and they're not responding
to any overtures.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.285
But shots were fired.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.287
Now the media circus is here.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.464
Insanity.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.205
Look, we need to make a move,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.207
in case this mass suicide
is imminent.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.165
Hold tight.
I'm not sure that it is.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.342
Hold tight?
Yeah, tell that to Grace.

20:56.385 --> 20:59.910
Bass Shepherd spent $5 million
on survival bunkers,

20:59.954 --> 21:02.217
which tells me he's not planning
on dying any time soon.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.481
Just let Liam and Alycia
gather some more intel

21:05.525 --> 21:08.179
before we do anything
we can't take back.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.486
TESS: I'm sorry, Liam, I haven't
found the term "Celebration Day"

21:10.530 --> 21:13.054
on Bass Shepherd's server.Oh, come on, Tess!

21:13.097 --> 21:15.535
All these files, and n-nothing
about Celebration Day?

21:15.578 --> 21:17.624
Sorry, Liam.
Would you like to try

21:17.667 --> 21:19.756
new search parameters?Whoa.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.890
Look at this link
someone just sent me.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.457
REPORTER: COPE leader
Bass Shepherd is inside

21:24.500 --> 21:26.241
the Maryland compound
where his followers

21:26.285 --> 21:28.548
are in armed standoff
with FBI, ATF,

21:28.591 --> 21:31.333
and members
of local law enforcement.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.553
The popular
motivational speaker...Crap, the media's swarming.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.250
This is when it goes
from bad to worse.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.860
What the hell?

21:38.035 --> 21:39.036
Liam.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.389
Everyone is logging out.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.348
Oh, my God.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.698
These are pictures of me.

21:48.742 --> 21:50.744
All my personal information.

21:52.398 --> 21:56.184
LadyHawk, you are an agent
of the U.S. government.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.360
You have betrayed RE/SYST.

21:58.404 --> 22:01.755
Now the world will know your
name and your true allegiance.

22:01.798 --> 22:06.150
Alycia Vrettou, you are
a traitor and a coward.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.457
No, Nero...

22:11.895 --> 22:13.462
They doxed me.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.638
I've just been...

22:15.682 --> 22:19.294
I've just been burned.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.775
I'm dead. LadyHawk is dead.

22:21.818 --> 22:24.168
What happened?

22:25.169 --> 22:27.171
What do you think happened?

22:27.215 --> 22:29.173
I put out the word on Bass,

22:29.217 --> 22:31.437
then there's a raid
on his compound?

22:31.480 --> 22:32.873
RE/SYST put
two and two together,

22:32.916 --> 22:35.310
and now LadyHawk equals
government narc.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.791
Narc? That's ridiculous.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.227
You're helping
save lives.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.795
Ridiculous to you, Darius!

22:41.838 --> 22:45.146
I knew this was a mistake,
but you never listen.

22:45.189 --> 22:46.974
You ruined me
once before,

22:47.017 --> 22:50.673
and now you've ruined me
for good.

23:07.603 --> 23:11.738
COPE members,
we are not here to hurt anyone.

23:11.781 --> 23:14.175
Our negotiators are trying
to reach you to come

23:14.218 --> 23:15.872
to a peaceful resolution.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.918
COPE members,
lay down your weapons

23:17.961 --> 23:20.224
and come out of the building
with your hands

23:20.268 --> 23:21.443
over your heads.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.314
Please comply.

23:32.367 --> 23:35.414
Harris

23:35.457 --> 23:37.241
Military-grade tear gas.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.634
They're not responding,
we're running out of time.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.201
No...
Grace.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.594
I'll keep Zoe safe.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.378
I promise.

23:45.946 --> 23:50.167
Agent Boyce, those
people are armed.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.473
My daughter's in here.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.953
I-I know one of the COPE
members, Jillian Hayes.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.781
Please just let me get in there
and try to talk to them.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.347
Ms. Barrows, I cannot authorize

23:56.391 --> 23:58.088
putting a civilian
in the line of fire.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.047
Now, please get back
to the command vehicle now.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.398
Sir. No response.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.707
All right, enough waiting.
We're going in.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.405
BOYCE: All right, listen up.
I want two squads approaching

24:10.449 --> 24:12.059
from the north
and east entrance.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.582
Third squad is gonna flank
and take the west side.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.542
Now, you know
the drill.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.892
Do not engage until you
see my visual signal.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.248
Stop! That's my mom.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.771
No, Grace, Grace!

24:29.642 --> 24:31.295
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

24:31.339 --> 24:32.775
Grace!

24:32.819 --> 24:34.255
Grace, what are you doing?

24:34.298 --> 24:36.126
Hold your fire.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.086
Don't shoot.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.957
I'm unarmed,
I just want to talk.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.094
I'm going after her.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.487
No. Mr. Secretary.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.879
We make a move,
they make a move.

24:49.923 --> 24:53.230
We have to let this play out.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.058
Damn it, Grace.

25:04.851 --> 25:08.071
Grace, I hope you know
what you're doing.

25:25.959 --> 25:26.525
Zoe.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.875
Mom.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.093
Baby.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.442
What did they do to you?

25:31.486 --> 25:34.533
No... it's not me.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.188
Grace, I'm so sorry.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.451
Alonzo?
Hey!

25:40.495 --> 25:43.498
You need to get your
people off our premises.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.021
We haven't done anything wrong,
but we are armed

25:45.065 --> 25:46.022
and we're prepared
to protect ourselves.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.721
What's your name?

25:48.764 --> 25:50.505
Nora.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.899
Nora, I'm Grace.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.814
Right now, can we agree
that Detective Carter

25:54.857 --> 25:56.250
needs medical care?

25:56.293 --> 25:58.731
He forced his way
into our sanctuary.

25:58.774 --> 26:01.603
He had no business...I hear you. He made a mistake.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.300
But let's not make
an even greater one

26:03.344 --> 26:05.128
by letting an innocent man die.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.827
So why don't you just
put your guns down?

26:07.870 --> 26:11.352
I'm not gonna spend the last 58
days of my life in a jail cell.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.354
58 days?

26:13.397 --> 26:15.748
But Celebration Day's today.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.184
Yes, it is.

26:17.227 --> 26:20.883
I thought Bass had
planned a mass suicide.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.930
NORA:
No, he didn't.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.933
That's ridiculous
and unnecessary.

26:26.976 --> 26:30.414
Everyone here is free
and happy because we accept

26:30.458 --> 26:32.939
the inevitable,
that we're all going to die

26:32.982 --> 26:35.028
when the asteroid comes.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.944
So what's Celebration Day?

26:37.987 --> 26:40.773
A spectacular event.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.513
It's gonna be explosive.

26:53.002 --> 26:56.049
Nora. I'm gonna need you
to let me walk out of here

26:56.092 --> 26:58.312
with Detective Carter
and my daughter.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.314
I am asking you, please.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.837
I can't allow that, Grace.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.361
But I can.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.713
You need to let them go now.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.849
You can let them go
and still be true to Bass.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.242
Whatever Bass Shepherd
had planned for today,

27:15.285 --> 27:16.809
this is not what he wanted.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.855
Shooting one of his own,
someone he clearly values.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.509
Nora.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.337
Nora, the media's out there.

27:23.380 --> 27:27.733
Does Bass want COPE
labeled as cop killers?

27:29.212 --> 27:31.388
This is your last chance
before it's too late

27:31.432 --> 27:33.564
for this man.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.393
Please.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.265
Please.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.230
Go. Go.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.539
Jillian, can you help us?

27:51.582 --> 27:53.584
No, no. She stays with us.

27:53.628 --> 27:56.022
What? No.JILLIAN:
No, it's okay.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.720
I want to stay.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.028
Let's go.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.294
Sir.MAN: Someone's coming out.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.733
:
Okay.

28:11.777 --> 28:15.389
Hold your fire.
Everyone, hold your fire.

28:15.432 --> 28:16.782
MAN:
Hold fire!

28:16.825 --> 28:18.653
Alonzo, I'm so sorry.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.437
About everything.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.178
:
It's okay.

28:22.222 --> 28:24.006
You got your daughter back.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.617
Zoe. Are you okay?

28:26.661 --> 28:28.010
All right, I got him, I got him.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.708
Hurry ahead. Go.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.753
Hey, we need a medic!

28:31.797 --> 28:34.147
Get a medic up here!Harris, Celebration Day
isn't what we thought.

28:34.190 --> 28:37.454
Wherever it is, we're
in the wrong place.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.988
Whatever your threat is,
don't bother.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.729
The worst has already happened.

28:50.772 --> 28:51.904
No.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.558
The worst is about to happen.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.560
Unless you can help us.

28:56.604 --> 28:59.041
RE/SYST was my home.

28:59.085 --> 29:02.175
The only people who've
ever been loyal to me.

29:02.218 --> 29:05.308
And I've lost them, all of them.

29:05.352 --> 29:08.094
I'm a woman without
a country or a family

29:08.137 --> 29:11.750
or anyone who gives
a damn about me.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.491
I'm alone.

29:14.535 --> 29:18.495
Alycia, family's
always been a mystery to me.

29:18.539 --> 29:23.152
One I've been trying
to crack for... a long time.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.942
A brilliant young
protégé crossed

29:29.985 --> 29:31.813
my doorstep a few years ago.

29:31.857 --> 29:32.945
She was stubborn.

29:32.988 --> 29:36.078
Willful, just like me.

29:36.122 --> 29:40.082
Really, the perfect candidate
to take over Tanz

29:40.126 --> 29:42.476
one day.

29:42.519 --> 29:45.261
Or so I thought.

29:45.305 --> 29:48.134
When you tried
to steal Tess,

29:48.177 --> 29:50.832
you weren't an employee stealing
from Tanz Industries,

29:50.876 --> 29:53.443
you were family.

29:53.487 --> 29:56.490
At the time, I thought
your betrayal proved

29:56.533 --> 30:00.711
everything I was taught wrongly
was right--

30:00.755 --> 30:03.845
emotional attachments
were a liability.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.543
Aren't they?

30:08.589 --> 30:11.853
Emotional attachments
are all we have.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.724
Everything else...

30:15.161 --> 30:16.858
...is nonsense.

30:16.902 --> 30:21.863
In order to have a
future, all of us,

30:21.907 --> 30:24.997
we need to let go of the past.

30:27.042 --> 30:30.611
Just need to come out
from the darkness.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.619
DARIUS : Explosive?
That's the word they used?

31:22.663 --> 31:25.013
Yes. Darius, there's going
to be an attack somewhere.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.667
A terrorist attack.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.060
You got to get in there.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.236
Get as much information
as you can.

31:30.279 --> 31:33.543
Look, the only way in
is to raid the compound.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.982
Is Grace out of there

31:37.025 --> 31:39.680
Yes, yes, but Jillian
is still inside.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.206
Do it.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.692
We're going in.

31:51.735 --> 31:52.867
Let's go, let's go.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.266
[elevator bell dings,
doors open]

32:00.309 --> 32:03.051
I just spoke with Harris.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.578
Zoe and Grace are safe.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.102
What about Jillian?

32:10.145 --> 32:11.973
She's still in the compound.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.236
Celebration Day isn't
a mass suicide.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.109
It's a terrorist attack.
We need to move fast.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.632
But they're all
about acceptance.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.112
Why would they blow
something up?

32:20.155 --> 32:21.417
Guys, listen to this.

32:21.461 --> 32:22.810
I found a document

32:22.853 --> 32:24.899
called "Manifesto."

32:24.943 --> 32:26.814
"Had the dinosaurs
not gone extinct,

32:26.857 --> 32:28.990
"we would not have had
the chance to rise.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.818
"We have been poor
stewards of the planet,

32:30.861 --> 32:34.648
now it's time
for what comes next."

32:34.691 --> 32:37.259
So if they were
accepting the end,

32:37.303 --> 32:40.045
what would they blow up?

32:40.088 --> 32:45.006
Tess, search Bass Shepherd's
file for the rail gun.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.835
TESS:
Searching, Darius.

32:47.878 --> 32:51.186
Three documents found
containing 1,243 pages.

32:53.449 --> 32:55.408
LIAM:
The rail gun schematics.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.758
What the hell
is Bass doing with these?

32:57.801 --> 32:59.629
He wants it to fail?

32:59.673 --> 33:01.849
So the asteroid can succeed.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.902
I'm sorry, I need
to take this, Mr., uh...

33:11.946 --> 33:14.993
Nate. Just Nate.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.522
Rosetta, I need you to initiate

33:22.565 --> 33:24.872
evacuation protocol immediately.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.048
But we're set to fire
the next shot in 20 minutes.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.095
You know how important it is
to stay on schedule.Listen to me, Rosetta.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.487
The rail gun may be in danger.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.098
You need to get everyone
out of there now.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.491
We think some people
are trying to set off a bomb.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.319
Why would anyone
want to do that?

33:37.363 --> 33:38.755
No time for questions.

33:38.799 --> 33:40.583
Help is on its way.

33:40.627 --> 33:42.063
You know what to do.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.978
I do.

33:53.466 --> 33:56.425
Attention, everyone,
this is not a drill.

33:56.469 --> 34:00.168
For your own safety, we must
initiate evacuation procedure.

34:00.212 --> 34:03.302
Please proceed calmly
to the nearest exit.

34:10.439 --> 34:12.441
What about you?

34:12.485 --> 34:14.748
I need to stay to power down.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.793
I'll join you. Go ahead.

34:16.837 --> 34:18.839
Come on, we got to go.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.499
:
Come on. Down.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.766
Agent. What do we know?

34:32.809 --> 34:34.072
We got most of them,
Mr. Secretary.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.769
What about Jillian Hayes?

34:35.812 --> 34:37.858
She's gone, along with their
apparent ringleader, Nora.

34:37.901 --> 34:40.339
Gone
We had every exit covered.

34:40.382 --> 34:44.125
My teams are searching the
area, sir. We will find them.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.954
Agent Boyce, check for tunnels.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.348
Yes, sir.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.784
All right, listen up!

34:50.827 --> 34:54.440
Bring up the rail gun
security feed.

34:55.702 --> 34:57.486
ALYCIA:
All right. We're in.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.053
We've got eyes
on the inside.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.446
Rosetta's still
shutting down the power.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.361
They can't sweep
the tunnels until

35:02.404 --> 35:04.624
the electromagnets are down.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.984
Whoa. Whoa, that's, um,
that's Nate, Jillian's friend.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.073
The guy who brought her to COPE.

35:34.610 --> 35:37.091
What are you doing here?
You need to evacuate.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.181
FEMALE VOICE:
Warning: system malfunction.

35:40.225 --> 35:43.184
Warning. Warning.Move.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.186
Warning.

35:45.230 --> 35:48.885
Tess. Can you shut down the
rail gun's hardware from here?

35:48.929 --> 35:51.497
TESS: I don't have
access to that system.Tess!

35:51.540 --> 35:54.239
FEMALE VOICE: Warning.Cooling system's shut down.

35:54.282 --> 35:55.936
Warning.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.720
I'm locked out.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.069
It's all right.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.900
This is a good thing.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.293
Dear God.

36:31.058 --> 36:34.322
REPORTER: While media has not
yet been granted access

36:34.366 --> 36:36.542
to the site, the huge explosion

36:36.585 --> 36:39.066
could be felt
as far as 50 miles away.

36:39.109 --> 36:41.590
The extent of the damage has not
yet been released to the public,

36:41.634 --> 36:44.593
but by all accounts,
this is a devastating blow

36:44.637 --> 36:48.075
to the government's asteroid
collision prevention project.

36:48.118 --> 36:53.123
They were celebrating
the end of everything.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.607
You're still planning
on leaving?

36:58.651 --> 37:01.610
With Zoe?

37:01.654 --> 37:03.873
Uncle Nick's behind bars.

37:03.917 --> 37:07.747
Where would I even
go at this point?

37:15.145 --> 37:17.365
I'm here for you, Grace.

37:17.409 --> 37:20.760
Till the end.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.805
Whatever happens.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.128
There has to be something.

37:41.171 --> 37:44.000
There's no way
to reconstruct it.

37:44.044 --> 37:47.134
It's too late.

37:47.177 --> 37:49.179
I'm sorry.

37:55.055 --> 37:56.491
Your ankle.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.672
Really?

38:03.716 --> 38:05.108
Live the rest of your days

38:05.152 --> 38:07.894
as you see fit.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.557
Really?

38:18.600 --> 38:20.863
That's it?

38:20.907 --> 38:23.910
You're just giving up?

38:26.086 --> 38:29.437
Do you think COPE was right?

38:29.481 --> 38:33.311
Does this species
deserve another chance?

38:33.354 --> 38:36.923
Or should we just go join
the dinosaurs in the dustbin?

38:44.322 --> 38:45.888
Dinosaurs couldn't do this.

38:45.932 --> 38:48.761
["What Is Life"
by George Harrison playing]

38:51.285 --> 38:53.809
They couldn't do that. You ever
seen a T. rex play the guitar?

38:56.290 --> 38:58.988
Darius.

38:59.032 --> 39:02.078
Come on, Darius.

39:02.122 --> 39:05.081
We still have 58 days
to knock that bloody space rock

39:05.125 --> 39:07.649
off its course.

39:07.693 --> 39:11.392
Yeah. And there's
a solar sail out there

39:11.436 --> 39:12.785
looking for a dance partner.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.003
Right.

39:17.964 --> 39:22.185
I'm not giving up until
