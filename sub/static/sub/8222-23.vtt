00:00.567 --> 00:02.933
Do not try what you're about
to see at home.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.767
We consult with experts,
we take every precaution,

00:05.839 --> 00:09.605
and we have years of experience
in dangerous situations.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.509
On this episode
of "Mythbusters"...

00:14.214 --> 00:17.183
...we've got a classic
collection of iconic conundrums.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.586
I think we killed
Captain Kirk!

00:20.653 --> 00:25.113
First, Jamie and Adam answer
the age-old western question...

00:25.191 --> 00:27.056
can you light a match
with a bullet?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.219
Punch in!

00:28.294 --> 00:30.922
Then, can you really
safely dip your digits

00:30.997 --> 00:33.192
into searing hot molten metal?

00:33.266 --> 00:35.860
Is this the first Terminator
you've ever cooked?

00:35.935 --> 00:38.028
And in a camp prank classic...

00:38.104 --> 00:40.265
Got my jammies.
I'm ready to go to work.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.104
...will a wet hand
lead to a bed-wetting?

00:43.176 --> 00:46.077
I don't think he's involuntarily
urinating yet.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.511
<i>Then Grant, Jessi, and Tory...</i>

00:47.580 --> 00:49.138
Holy crap!

00:49.215 --> 00:54.744
...tackle the nauseating
tall tale of the earwax candle.

00:54.821 --> 00:55.845
Let's burn it.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.549
And finally...

00:57.624 --> 00:58.818
Yes, yes!

00:58.892 --> 01:01.918
...can you blow away
a "Star Trek" baddie

01:01.995 --> 01:03.690
with a bamboo bazooka?

01:03.763 --> 01:05.525
Whoo-hoo!

01:08.401 --> 01:10.266
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:10.703 --> 01:11.499
Adam Savage...

01:11.571 --> 01:12.731
That is science.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.273
<i>...and Jamie Hyneman.</i>

01:14.340 --> 01:17.036
Things are gonna start to get
a little crazy in here.

01:17.110 --> 01:21.376
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.848
Joining them...
Kari Byron...

01:23.917 --> 01:25.544
Grant Imahara...

01:25.618 --> 01:27.245
It's lethal, people.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.548
...Tory Belleci...

01:28.621 --> 01:29.918
Aah! Aah!

01:29.989 --> 01:31.820
...and featuring Jessi Combs.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.586
That was awesome!

01:33.660 --> 01:35.924
<i>They don't just
tell the myths.</i>

01:37.363 --> 01:38.489
...Are you ready?
... I'm ready.

01:38.565 --> 01:41.557
They put them to the test.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:51.111 --> 01:53.045
So, you're trying to tell me
you're nuts, right?

01:53.113 --> 01:53.636
No.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.840
Simply that this coconut
is the perfect symbol

01:55.915 --> 01:58.076
for what this episode is all about.
... How so?

01:58.151 --> 01:59.914
In a nutshell,
we get a lot of myths

01:59.986 --> 02:01.214
that are too small to test.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.221
...We call them mini-myths, right?
... Yep.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.382
Until now, those myths have been
a tough nut to crack,

02:05.458 --> 02:07.221
but I think that
we've nutted out a solution,

02:07.293 --> 02:09.625
and that is to throw
as many mini-myths

02:09.696 --> 02:11.789
into a single episode
as possible,

02:11.865 --> 02:13.526
specifically
this episode.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.760
...How many?
... Six.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.802
And I figured
we'd begin with a classic...

02:16.870 --> 02:18.599
can you mail a coconut
without any packaging?

02:18.671 --> 02:19.729
I thought we'd start out

02:19.806 --> 02:21.706
by putting a stamp
and our address on it,

02:21.774 --> 02:24.242
see if it comes back to
the shop by the end of the show.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.402
And you know?

02:25.478 --> 02:26.206
There's one I've always
wanted to try, which is...

02:26.279 --> 02:28.645
can you light a strike-anywhere
match with a bullet?

02:28.715 --> 02:30.740
Well, let's get started.

02:30.817 --> 02:35.584
It's a match made in
mini-myth fan-request heaven.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.054
A single testable question

02:37.123 --> 02:39.751
that could be answered
in one glorious afternoon

02:39.826 --> 02:42.158
down at the gun range.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.923
Through the magic of editing,
allow me to demonstrate

02:43.997 --> 02:46.591
exactly what we hope
to achieve today.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.099
Okay, I'm ready.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.065
Okay, don't move.

02:51.137 --> 02:52.627
I won't.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.013
That's what this story's
all about.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.742
Can a bullet light a match?

03:03.816 --> 03:06.546
Well, when you get right down
to it, it's all about friction.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.143
If this myth is true,

03:08.221 --> 03:11.088
we're going to be able
to light this with this

03:11.157 --> 03:15.150
while this is traveling
at nearly 800 feet per second.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.422
The question is

03:16.496 --> 03:19.192
whether that bullet
is able to cause enough friction

03:19.265 --> 03:22.063
when it grazes that match
to actually ignite it

03:22.135 --> 03:24.626
without blowing
the head of the match off.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.729
I'll tell you...
I'm not sure it's gonna work,

03:26.806 --> 03:28.205
and it's not about
the precision.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.605
That I feel that we can solve.

03:29.676 --> 03:30.643
I think it's about
the length of time

03:30.710 --> 03:32.905
this bullet will be in contact
with this match,

03:32.979 --> 03:35.106
and whether that length of time
is long enough

03:35.181 --> 03:39.845
to set the lighting chemical...
Conflagration in motion.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.386
<i>So, the guys are ready.</i>

03:41.454 --> 03:43.319
Gun is going hot.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.380
They have their .45-caliber gun

03:45.458 --> 03:47.824
with its large,
slow moving slug,

03:47.894 --> 03:49.725
perfect for this experiment,

03:49.796 --> 03:53.163
aimed by a laser
at the tip of the match.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.860
Firing in three...

03:54.934 --> 03:56.424
Surely this won't take long.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.436
...one.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.404
Maybe it will.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.168
Not lit. Not even gone.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.971
Apparently it's too low.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.104
Despite Adam's pleasure

04:08.181 --> 04:10.672
at the quality
of the high-speed shot...

04:10.750 --> 04:13.480
That is so pretty.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.781
It's so crisp.

04:14.854 --> 04:18.688
You can see the reflection
of the match head in the bullet.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.283
Even with
laser-guided precision,

04:21.361 --> 04:23.226
they completely missed.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.163
So, they're reverting
to a more utilitarian method

04:26.232 --> 04:28.462
of marking the bullet's
trajectory...

04:28.534 --> 04:29.466
Let's do it.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.366
...cardboard
and trial and error.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.804
Three, two, one.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.575
Plenty of error...

04:37.644 --> 04:38.611
That's crazy high.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.774
Well, you shot the head
right off.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.611
...and plenty of trial.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.613
Oh, it missed it!

04:46.686 --> 04:49.314
So, close,
but it's not touching it.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.858
Well, we're a few shots in,

04:53.926 --> 04:56.258
and we have not gotten
the match to light yet,

04:56.329 --> 04:57.853
but we're in the thick of it.

04:58.698 --> 04:59.790
So close!

04:59.866 --> 05:03.165
We knocked
most of the red off the match

05:03.236 --> 05:07.400
without destroying it,
so we're really, really close.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.270
We're trying to get
this grazing action,

05:09.342 --> 05:10.900
without destroying
the match head,

05:10.977 --> 05:12.911
which we've already done.

05:13.846 --> 05:14.938
Too high.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.039
We want to just graze
the very tip of it.

05:17.116 --> 05:19.880
I don't know. To get one to light may take
another few shots...

05:21.220 --> 05:22.881
...may take another few hours.

05:22.955 --> 05:24.479
What do you think?

05:24.557 --> 05:26.149
I don't see no fire.

05:26.225 --> 05:27.453
<i>No lit match.</i>

05:27.527 --> 05:29.461
But a quick look
at the high-speed

05:29.529 --> 05:30.962
confirms they are on target.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.190
Oh, perfect!

05:32.265 --> 05:34.995
It's just knocking off
a little bit of the white there.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.729
Just barely touched it.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.464
That's what's required.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.233
The bullet grazed
the match head,

05:40.306 --> 05:42.467
but it didn't kick start
the chain of events

05:42.542 --> 05:43.702
that end in a lit match.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.437
This is how matches work.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.536
In the head of a match,
you've got a fuel

05:47.613 --> 05:49.080
which is a sulfur-based product.

05:49.148 --> 05:50.376
You've got an o xidizer,

05:50.450 --> 05:52.475
which is usually
potassium chlorate,

05:52.552 --> 05:54.042
and you've got glass powders,

05:54.120 --> 05:57.021
all held together in a binder
on the head of the match.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.682
The striker has glass powder,

05:58.758 --> 06:01.522
but it also has a small amount
of red phosphorus,

06:01.594 --> 06:04.222
and when you strike the match
on the striker,

06:04.297 --> 06:07.164
that glass-on-glass friction
generates enough heat

06:07.233 --> 06:10.225
to convert the red phosphorus
into white phosphorus,

06:10.303 --> 06:13.670
which happens to burst into
flames when it's exposed to air.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.766
Now, in a strike-anywhere match
like this one,

06:16.843 --> 06:20.074
all those same ingredients
are on the head of the match,

06:20.146 --> 06:23.013
and so you can strike it
on any abrasive surface,

06:23.082 --> 06:24.413
same reaction occurs...

06:24.484 --> 06:27.146
generates heat,
generates white phosphorus...

06:27.220 --> 06:28.619
you've got a lit match.

06:28.688 --> 06:29.450
<i>And back on the range,</i>

06:29.522 --> 06:33.014
despite feeling like they've got
a busted myth on their hands,

06:33.092 --> 06:35.890
the guys lock and load
for one last shot.

06:35.962 --> 06:38.294
Firing
in three, two, one.

06:40.666 --> 06:41.598
Yeah!

06:41.667 --> 06:44.431
Nice! Punch in.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.404
You asked for it,
and we made it happen.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.997
Well, that's fully burnt.
We did it.

06:49.075 --> 06:53.876
But keep in mind that it took us
nine tries to make this happen.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.777
We had precision equipment

06:55.848 --> 06:59.306
and the accuracy required
was down to, you know,

06:59.385 --> 07:01.148
1/1,000 of an inch or so.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.915
That's great.

07:02.989 --> 07:05.287
That is so cool.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.491
Yeah!

07:09.562 --> 07:11.996
Well, I was wrong again.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.157
This was fully able
to light this

07:14.233 --> 07:18.863
when they were only in contact
for 1/12,000 of a second.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.772
That's mighty short,
but it's mighty confirmed.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.974
All right, quick-hit myths
from the fan site.

07:30.049 --> 07:30.572
What do we have?

07:30.650 --> 07:32.584
Well, the first one
comes from the movie "Shrek. "

07:32.652 --> 07:34.586
..."Can donkeys talk?"
... No. That's confirmed.

07:34.654 --> 07:35.985
Can we hear
the real one?

07:36.055 --> 07:37.079
Okay, well, in the movie,

07:37.156 --> 07:40.182
Shrek uses his own
earwax to make a candle.

07:40.259 --> 07:41.556
Ugh, that's disgusting.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.356
I'm interested.
Please go on.

07:43.429 --> 07:45.590
Okay, well,
first we need to find out

07:45.665 --> 07:46.996
if earwax is flammable.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.591
And finally we need to collect
lots and lots of it.

07:49.669 --> 07:52.502
I always wondered
what was in my ears.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.767
You might want to get this
checked out.

07:54.841 --> 07:59.369
<i>It's a classic scene
from the, uh, green screen.</i>

07:59.445 --> 08:02.471
Shrek pulls enough wax
from his ears

08:02.548 --> 08:06.177
to form a fully functional,
flammable candle.

08:06.252 --> 08:10.086
And to find out if this simple
and nauseating concept

08:10.156 --> 08:11.487
is even possible,

08:11.557 --> 08:13.286
the team has brought in
an expert.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.986
...You ready to go for it?
... Oh, let's start digging.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.086
Digging?
I thought we were cleaning.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.131
Well, that, too.

08:19.198 --> 08:22.634
First up, Dr. Lustig
is digging up a sample

08:22.702 --> 08:25.170
for a proof-of-concept
flammability test.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.796
Holy crap.

08:26.873 --> 08:27.862
What'd you get?

08:27.940 --> 08:29.805
We got a little bit there.
Not too bad.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.106
With the sample secured,
the team gathers,

08:32.178 --> 08:33.736
ready to burn the evidence.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.678
So, what do you guys think
of the earwax?

08:35.748 --> 08:38.182
...That came out of your ear?
... Yeah, pretty gross, huh?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.410
Let's burn it.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.214
Hang on a second there,
pyromaniac.

08:41.287 --> 08:42.811
Now,
since this is about candles,

08:42.889 --> 08:44.880
I have some commercial
candle wax to compare,

08:44.957 --> 08:46.151
as well
as some beeswax.

08:46.225 --> 08:47.385
All right, this'll be good.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.189
We'll see which one
is more flammable.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.559
So, the whole point
of today's experiment

08:50.630 --> 08:51.995
is to find out
if human earwax

08:52.064 --> 08:54.328
is, in fact, flammable.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.526
But not only that...

08:55.601 --> 08:57.569
to be able
to compare it visually

08:57.637 --> 08:58.797
to the types of waxes

08:58.871 --> 09:01.305
that are found
in commercial-grade candles,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.774
namely paraffin or beeswax.

09:03.843 --> 09:04.969
...Cool.
... All right.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.409
...Okay.
... Should we move on to the earwax?

09:06.479 --> 09:09.880
Ooh, it's sparking!

09:09.949 --> 09:11.610
Dude,
that was in your ear!

09:11.684 --> 09:15.381
The paraffin
and the beeswax burnt normally,

09:15.454 --> 09:16.580
as I would have expected.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.283
The really astounding thing

09:18.357 --> 09:20.723
is how well
the human earwax burned.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.693
And it's not, like, a slow burn,

09:22.762 --> 09:25.026
like the paraffin
or the beeswax...

09:25.097 --> 09:28.066
sort of a more aggressive burn
with a crackling.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.396
It was a

09:29.468 --> 09:31.527
Which... I'm not exactly sure
what that is.

09:31.604 --> 09:34.664
Maybe it's skin cells
or little hairs.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.903
But very surprising
that it burnt well.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.808
I think this looks good
for our myth.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.212
<i>And that means
they can move on to stage two...</i>

09:43.282 --> 09:46.308
collecting enough earwax
to make a candle.

09:46.385 --> 09:49.912
But what's immediately clear is
it's gonna take a while.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.115
You have clean ear canals.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.385
We're gonna have to call
in a lot of people, huh?

09:53.459 --> 09:55.017
We're gonna need
a lot of people.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.187
All right, everybody,
come on in!

09:57.263 --> 10:00.164
Cue the usual suspects...

10:00.232 --> 10:03.395
the Mythbusters team
in all its waxy...

10:03.469 --> 10:04.800
Victory!

10:04.870 --> 10:07.134
...oily...
- Wow!

10:07.206 --> 10:08.298
...hairy...

10:08.374 --> 10:10.535
...Got it!
... All right then. Happy to help.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.211
...and greasy-eared glory.

10:15.147 --> 10:16.774
...Can I take these off?
... Oh, yes.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.544
Otherwise it'll be
really hard.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.178
After plumbing
the "ear-y" depths

10:21.253 --> 10:26.316
of the last few team members,
family members, and passers-by,

10:26.392 --> 10:28.360
Dr. Lustig is finished,

10:28.427 --> 10:30.918
and the ear-wax candle making
can begin.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.228
Next up
is an actual prank.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.702
Let me start
with a question...

10:38.771 --> 10:40.739
have you ever gone
to sleep-away camp?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.671
I was a camp counselor
for years.

10:42.742 --> 10:45.734
Okay, did you ever play pranks
on the kids in your charge?

10:45.811 --> 10:48.780
Of course. In fact,
that was a job requirement.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.543
Ever take
a sleeping person's hand

10:50.616 --> 10:52.345
and dip it in a bowl
of warm water

10:52.418 --> 10:54.613
to see
if they'd wet themselves?

10:54.687 --> 10:57.019
Actually, no, but I have always
wondered about that one.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.954
You're not gonna
have to wonder much longer,

10:59.025 --> 11:00.652
'cause we're gonna put it
to the test.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.819
Well, all right then.

11:02.895 --> 11:05.693
<i>Aside from our
sleeping human guinea pigs,</i>

11:05.765 --> 11:08.893
the only piece of equipment
the team requires for this test

11:08.968 --> 11:12.267
is this moisture-activated
voice alarm.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.272
So, how is it that these shiny
strips of metal

11:14.340 --> 11:16.035
are able to detect liquid?

11:16.108 --> 11:19.043
Well, when water crosses over
two of these strips,

11:19.111 --> 11:21.204
it'll allow a minute amount
of electrical current

11:21.280 --> 11:22.338
to pass through it,

11:22.415 --> 11:25.873
and this alarm right here is
sensitive enough to detect that

11:25.951 --> 11:27.384
and start yelling at me...

11:27.453 --> 11:29.284
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.686
...when it does.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.752
Next, the guys need a place
to sleep.

11:33.826 --> 11:36.192
Got my jammies.
I'm ready to go to work.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.730
And, here,
at the California Sleep Lab,

11:38.798 --> 11:40.766
in this bedroom with a view,

11:40.833 --> 11:44.064
they've got state-of-the-art
monitoring equipment.

11:44.136 --> 11:45.763
This is a camp prank...

11:45.838 --> 11:47.931
a staple of camp pranks
the world over

11:48.007 --> 11:49.531
for generations, I swear.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.441
And it is simply that if you
take a sleeping person's hand

11:52.511 --> 11:55.241
and place it in a bowl
of warm water,

11:55.314 --> 11:59.080
that person will involuntarily
wet themselves in their bed.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.312
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

12:02.221 --> 12:04.052
Yeah!
And that's where we come in.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.751
...All right, so we're gonna start your hook-up now.
... Okay.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.021
We have come to the California
Center for Sleep Disorders,

12:09.095 --> 12:09.754
and Jamie and I

12:09.829 --> 12:12.696
are each going to take turns
being the test subject.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.289
One of us will fall asleep
in this bed,

12:14.366 --> 12:16.857
and when we reach
the correct phase of sleep,

12:16.936 --> 12:18.801
the other one will sneak
in with a bowl of water

12:18.871 --> 12:21.499
and see if this is,
in fact, true.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.075
Do I think this is gonna work?

12:25.144 --> 12:28.170
Well, in my case, not so much.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.511
As it happens,
I'm a very light sleeper,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.278
and my suspicion is that...

12:32.351 --> 12:34.410
if somebody comes in
in the middle of the night

12:34.487 --> 12:36.648
and tries to mess
with my hand...

12:36.722 --> 12:39.885
the other one's gonna hit them
square in the face.

12:39.959 --> 12:44.623
<i>And that is surely the key
stumbling block for this myth.</i>

12:44.697 --> 12:46.324
Is he sucking his thumb?

12:46.398 --> 12:49.162
<i>Unless they are
absolutely out for the count,</i>

12:49.235 --> 12:51.203
getting the sleeper's hand
into the water

12:51.270 --> 12:54.000
without waking them up
will be tough.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.667
But that's where
clinical director Michael Salemi

12:56.742 --> 12:57.538
comes in.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.374
His eyes are closed,
but he's definitely not asleep.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.777
With all the electrodes
on Jamie's head,

13:01.847 --> 13:03.314
what are we
looking at there?

13:03.382 --> 13:04.872
These are his eyes
right here,

13:04.950 --> 13:07.680
and we're looking at eye
movements, and this is his EEG.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.345
So, we're looking
at his brain wave patterns here,

13:09.421 --> 13:10.581
to see
if there's any changes

13:10.656 --> 13:13.420
that would indicate that
he's actually fallen asleep.

13:13.492 --> 13:16.620
Basically, by monitoring
the brain's electrical activity,

13:16.695 --> 13:19.425
we can tell how deep
is Jamie's sleep.

13:19.498 --> 13:22.695
Stages one and two
are light, transitional stages

13:22.768 --> 13:25.259
that won't be ideal
for this test.

13:25.337 --> 13:28.431
Stage three,
also called slow-wave sleep,

13:28.507 --> 13:29.565
is the goal.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.702
Here, brain activity
is significantly reduced,

13:32.778 --> 13:35.474
and the sleeper
is less easily woken.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.709
But Jamie's playing hard to get.

13:37.783 --> 13:42.447
He's not sleeping.
He's waiting.

13:42.521 --> 13:43.283
<i>And Adam...</i>

13:43.355 --> 13:45.152
geared up
with night-vision goggles...

13:45.224 --> 13:48.921
loses patience and goes in.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.552
Oh,
you're totally awake.

13:50.629 --> 13:52.358
You've had, like,
two hours man.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.399
Sorry. Nice getup.

13:54.466 --> 13:55.262
Thank you.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.427
I think your time is up.
I think it's my turn.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.097
So, I was right about Jamie
not sleeping.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.436
He was waiting,
and he waited us out.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.976
He waited so long, we had to
throw him out as a test subject.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.911
I've always wanted
the cyber hair extensions.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.813
And now... it's my turn.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.881
<i>As soon
as Adam's down, he's out...</i>

14:15.988 --> 14:18.286
...and, finally,
things are looking up.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.221
Or are they?

14:19.291 --> 14:21.282
Although Adam dropped to sleep
really quickly,

14:21.360 --> 14:24.056
he may not be a good candidate
for this, either,

14:24.129 --> 14:26.188
because Adam has sleep apnea,

14:26.265 --> 14:29.962
which means that he's struggling
for air from time to time,

14:30.035 --> 14:31.525
and it's waking him up.

14:32.905 --> 14:35.430
So, he may not be able to get
down into that deep sleep

14:35.507 --> 14:38.601
that we need him to be at
to do this trick.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.838
<i>But before the team
runs out of patience,</i>

14:40.913 --> 14:44.405
Adam finally descends
into stage-three sleep.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.508
However,
there's another complication.

14:46.585 --> 14:48.246
Both of his hands
are under his head,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.914
so I don't know
what to do other than try it.

14:50.990 --> 14:54.426
If he doesn't wake up,
maybe we'll get what we need.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.018
<i>With Adam twisted awkwardly,</i>

14:58.097 --> 15:01.123
Jamie manages to get
Adam's hand over the bowl.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.394
But the best he can do

15:02.468 --> 15:06.302
is gently pour water
over the hand until...

15:08.407 --> 15:11.035
...our camp-prank victim awakes.

15:12.478 --> 15:15.538
All right, then.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.014
So, Adam, I noticed
that your hand is wet.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.074
Is there anything else
that's wet?

15:21.787 --> 15:24.347
Nope. It's all dry.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.515
Darn it!

15:25.591 --> 15:27.286
It's definitely not looking
very good for this myth

15:27.359 --> 15:27.984
at this point.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.556
Well, I mean, it's obvious
we don't have enough earwax

15:30.629 --> 15:33.063
to melt it down into a big vat
and dip the wick in

15:33.132 --> 15:34.622
like you would normally
make candles.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.167
So, why don't we try
and melt that,

15:36.235 --> 15:37.862
lay it out and roll it
around a wick,

15:37.937 --> 15:40.098
kind of like you do with those
beeswax type of candles?

15:40.172 --> 15:42.140
Yeah,
that might work.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.267
I'm not really sure how this
is gonna work as a candle.

15:45.344 --> 15:46.606
Yeah, it's flammable,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.943
but it's not quite the same
as regular wax.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.107
...All right, well, are you ready to melt?
... Yes.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.377
The bigger question for me

15:52.451 --> 15:55.943
is actually getting it
into candle form.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.114
They look more like boogers
than earwax, don't they?

15:58.190 --> 15:59.452
Yeah.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.992
<i>Those with sensitive...</i>

16:02.428 --> 16:03.486
Are you gonna throw up?

16:03.562 --> 16:05.393
...not-so-steely stomachs...

16:08.634 --> 16:13.230
...might want to avert your eyes
around about now.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.973
Why are we making
this candle?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.533
I almost threw up!

16:19.611 --> 16:21.704
Well, maybe if you just
keep breathing it, you get used to it.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.044
Probably not.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.140
All right,
it looks pretty soft.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.014
Do you want to like
smash out a big...

16:37.129 --> 16:38.892
That sucked!

16:41.467 --> 16:43.128
All right.
Here's your wick.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.796
Making a candle was a lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.772
Cool. It's like
a little ear-wax taco.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.433
It's not like
it's a prepackaged material

16:50.509 --> 16:53.103
that you pull out and form
into a shape of a candle.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.442
I mean, this is earwax
you're talking about.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.072
It's actually working,
kind of.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.549
There's hair in there,
there's skin cells,

16:59.618 --> 17:02.951
and to get it melted down
into the shape of a candle

17:03.022 --> 17:04.387
was hard enough.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.788
Look at that!
We got a candle!

17:06.858 --> 17:08.223
<i>Well, almost.</i>

17:08.292 --> 17:10.352
The final proof
is in the lighting.

17:10.429 --> 17:15.059
Okay, so for our side-by-side
comparison, we have...

17:15.134 --> 17:16.829
Oh, are you're gonna stick it
on that cupcake?

17:16.902 --> 17:18.563
A regular
birthday candle.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.537
Be careful it doesn't
fall apart.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.096
Ugh.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.406
With the earwax all together
and the wick in it,

17:25.477 --> 17:28.537
personally, I don't think it's
gonna melt like a normal candle

17:28.614 --> 17:30.582
because, when we tested it,
it sparkled.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.207
Go! Okay.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.047
So, it's either
gonna be like 4th of July,

17:34.119 --> 17:35.643
or it's gonna go
completely out.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.383
It's lit like a candle,
but we'll see if it lasts.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.652
Look how it's bubbling up,
right around...

17:40.726 --> 17:42.216
oh, that's going down.

17:42.294 --> 17:45.161
Yep, it's burning up, just like
in our little sample test.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.959
It burns up,
and then that's it.

17:47.032 --> 17:47.930
It's done.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.024
I don't think
it's gonna last.

17:49.101 --> 17:49.829
Nope.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.427
...Oh.
... It's going out. It's going out.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.635
Okay.
23 seconds.

17:54.706 --> 17:56.537
Not much of a candle
at all.

17:56.608 --> 17:57.267
Mnh-mnh.

17:57.342 --> 18:00.038
<i>Nope, and that's down to
the composition of candle wax,</i>

18:00.112 --> 18:02.273
as opposed to earwax.

18:02.347 --> 18:06.340
The long-chain hydrocarbons
in paraffin or beeswax melt

18:06.418 --> 18:09.319
and, in liquid form,
get pulled up the wick

18:09.388 --> 18:12.551
where they burn in a slow,
controlled fashion.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.956
Earwax,
full of dead skin cells,

18:15.027 --> 18:18.861
hair, fatty acids, and
cholesterol may be flammable,

18:18.931 --> 18:23.197
but, critically, it doesn't melt
or burn consistently.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.792
All right.
Looks like this one's busted.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.963
...Busted.
... Totally busted.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.236
...Happy birthday!
... Happy birthday!

18:32.611 --> 18:34.579
So we've got one last chance,

18:34.646 --> 18:39.106
and, for that, we're gonna
induct Matt, our runner,

18:39.184 --> 18:42.711
and we'll see whether we can
get him to wet his bed.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.949
Let's make mama proud.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.012
Sweet dreams.

18:47.493 --> 18:51.156
<i>And mere minutes after
lights-out, sweet dreams it is.</i>

18:51.230 --> 18:54.996
There we go.
They're starting to spread out.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.433
All right, let's get a bucket
of water ready.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.095
Let this be a lesson
to you kids,

18:59.171 --> 19:01.002
lest you think
working for "Mythbusters"

19:01.073 --> 19:04.008
is all fun and games,
even the runners are not above

19:04.076 --> 19:05.805
getting humiliated
on national television.

19:09.815 --> 19:13.717
This is perfect.
Matt's hand is in the bowl.

19:13.785 --> 19:17.312
It's the ideal illustration
of this myth.

19:17.389 --> 19:18.913
I don't hear the alarm,

19:18.991 --> 19:22.825
so I don't think he's
involuntarily urinating yet.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.862
<i>Not yet,</i>

19:23.929 --> 19:27.330
but after five minutes of hand
and wrist immersion,

19:27.399 --> 19:28.297
this happens...

19:28.367 --> 19:30.335
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

19:30.402 --> 19:31.892
Oh, my God!

19:31.970 --> 19:35.098
With the alarm going nuts
and bedlam in the bedroom,

19:35.174 --> 19:37.165
it's not until the lights
are switched on

19:37.242 --> 19:40.302
that the offending puddle
can be examined.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.574
Dude, did you think
you peed yourself?

19:42.648 --> 19:44.479
I don't think I did.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.609
Roll over.
Let's see what's going on here.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.277
Looks like it could be
a spill.

19:48.353 --> 19:52.619
Yeah, it's not from the source,
unfortunately.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.057
How did it get
that separate puddle over there?

19:55.127 --> 19:56.685
If Matt says
it's not from the source,

19:56.762 --> 19:58.059
I'm gonna go with him.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.724
Yeah. Looks like it is
just on the side.

20:00.799 --> 20:05.099
I don't see wet pants overall.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.537
Well, if that is the case,
then it didn't work,

20:08.607 --> 20:10.871
'cause his hand was full-on
in that water for...

20:10.943 --> 20:13.070
...What was it? Five minutes or better?
... Yeah.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.203
Did you even feel it?

20:14.279 --> 20:15.746
No.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.873
That's awesome.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.884
I really thought that
we'd hit pay dirt with this myth

20:19.952 --> 20:22.648
when I heard this
start screaming, but, no.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.745
It's late in the middle
of the night,

20:23.822 --> 20:26.620
and after Matt's hand was in
that bowl for five minutes,

20:26.692 --> 20:30.594
some of the water sloshed out
and caused our alarm to go off.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.892
With all of this, I can't see
that we can call this myth

20:32.965 --> 20:34.660
anything but busted.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.529
<i>It's not quite a mini-myth,</i>

20:41.607 --> 20:45.941
but this trekkie tall tale
is too good to resist.

20:46.011 --> 20:46.636
I tell you what.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.442
I cannot believe how popular
this next myth is.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.675
Yeah, fans have been
requesting it for years,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.980
and when I announced that we
were doing this on the Internet,

20:54.052 --> 20:55.485
the reaction was massive.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.784
You're talking about
the Gorn episode of "Star Trek"!

20:57.856 --> 21:00.051
This is the episode from
the classic "Star Trek" series

21:00.125 --> 21:03.561
where Captain Kirk battles a reptilian
creature called the Gorn.

21:03.629 --> 21:06.393
Yeah, and right when you
think Captain Kirk is about to get defeated,

21:06.465 --> 21:08.797
he devises a weapon
using nothing but the things

21:08.867 --> 21:10.528
he finds
on this alien planet.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.035
Doesn't he make
his own gunpowder, as well?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.072
Heck, yeah.
He's Captain Kirk!

21:14.139 --> 21:15.197
Let's get this going.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.534
Enterprise,
three to beam up.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.237
You getting reception?

21:20.312 --> 21:21.472
Yeah, mine's real.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.778
<i>In a memorable
"Star Trek" moment,</i>

21:27.853 --> 21:31.118
a marooned Captain Kirk
channels MacGyver

21:31.189 --> 21:33.749
and makes a bamboo bazooka.

21:33.825 --> 21:35.986
Yes, yes.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.722
What?
What is it, Spock?

21:37.796 --> 21:39.661
An invention,
yeoman.

21:39.731 --> 21:43.360
<i>After scavenging the three basic
ingredients of gunpowder</i>

21:43.435 --> 21:45.426
and diamonds for ammunition...

21:45.504 --> 21:47.199
They would make
formidable projectiles.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.302
Oh, here comes the Gorn.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.867
...Kirk goes to work
mixing his materials

21:53.945 --> 21:55.469
and constructing the cannon.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.340
Can he do it?

21:58.417 --> 22:01.113
If he has the time,
yeoman.

22:01.186 --> 22:04.155
If he has the time.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.656
Of course he has the time.
He's Kirk!

22:06.725 --> 22:08.317
But what about reality?

22:08.393 --> 22:10.657
Can you really
make your own gunpowder,

22:10.729 --> 22:15.291
and can you really
make a bazooka out of bamboo?

22:15.367 --> 22:17.130
Now, gunpowder's composed
of three things...

22:17.202 --> 22:19.762
potassium nitrate...

22:19.838 --> 22:21.328
Charcoal...

22:21.406 --> 22:22.737
And sulfur.

22:22.808 --> 22:26.335
Now, on their own, each of these
three things is nonexplosive.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.175
But the question is whether you
can combine them together

22:29.247 --> 22:30.612
without further refinement

22:30.682 --> 22:31.944
to create gunpowder

22:32.017 --> 22:35.145
capable of firing a projectile
out of a cannon.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.687
So, what we're gonna do

22:36.755 --> 22:39.223
is we're gonna make
Captain Kirk black powder.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.417
We're gonna take these elements,

22:40.492 --> 22:42.653
mix them up just like he does
in the TV clip,

22:42.728 --> 22:44.218
and compare it
to regular black powder.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.729
Now, the next big question
of this myth

22:45.797 --> 22:48.595
is whether or not we can build
a cannon out of bamboo

22:48.667 --> 22:50.965
that will withstand
the explosion of gunpowder.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.298
So, I'm gonna have a stab
at this,

22:52.371 --> 22:54.703
while I leave the boys
to their pyrotechnics.

22:54.773 --> 22:59.403
<i>And our pair of pyromaniacs
begin Pyrotechnics 101,</i>

22:59.478 --> 23:02.276
with the assumption
that Kirk knew the correct ratio

23:02.347 --> 23:04.315
of the three key ingredients.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.248
And, also, like their hero...

23:06.318 --> 23:08.149
Okay, dude,
Kirk or Picard?

23:08.220 --> 23:09.619
Are you kidding?
Kirk.

23:09.688 --> 23:10.985
...they're not using any tools

23:11.056 --> 23:12.990
to grind and mix
the black powder,

23:13.058 --> 23:15.526
just some rocks
from the floor of the set.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.290
...Mr. Spock or Lieutenant Commander Data?
... Spock.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.695
...Did Han shoot first?
... Yes, he did.

23:20.766 --> 23:23.132
So, we've been at this
for a good 15 minutes or so...

23:23.201 --> 23:24.600
It's starting to look like
black powder.

23:24.669 --> 23:27.194
...no longer than Kirk
might have had

23:27.272 --> 23:29.035
while down on the planet.

23:29.107 --> 23:32.599
And now it's time to test
our black-powder formulas.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.942
First, what we're gonna do is
let off some real black powder,

23:36.014 --> 23:39.040
just to see
what it's supposed to look like.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.544
Good!

23:42.621 --> 23:46.148
Then we're each gonna try
our own recipes,

23:46.224 --> 23:47.851
and see what we've got.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.985
<i>So, that's what
the guys are aiming for.</i>

23:50.061 --> 23:53.258
That's the kind of reaction
Kirk achieved

23:53.331 --> 23:55.856
by hand-mixing his gunpowder.

23:55.934 --> 23:59.495
And we're about to find out
if that's possible.

23:59.571 --> 24:00.833
...Hey!
... Hey!

24:00.906 --> 24:03.170
It's kind of
doing something.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.401
It's a little
something something.

24:04.476 --> 24:05.636
...Yeah.
... It's weird.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.371
Kind of burning like...

24:07.446 --> 24:10.006
It's like those snakes
that you get at 4th of July.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.708
So, no,
we didn't get the big poof

24:11.783 --> 24:13.410
like black powder
on our first test,

24:13.485 --> 24:16.181
but I'm actually
pleasantly surprised,

24:16.254 --> 24:19.087
because I fully expected
nothing to happen...

24:19.157 --> 24:20.681
no ignition.

24:20.759 --> 24:21.555
Wow, look at that.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.888
That's a little better.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.292
But we did get ignition,

24:24.362 --> 24:26.387
and it smelled
like black powder,

24:26.465 --> 24:28.490
and, furthermore,
we got these sparks.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.057
...Hey.
... Whoa.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.070
So, that actually means
that we're on the right track.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.298
I think it's just
a matter of time

24:34.372 --> 24:35.999
till we find the right ratio.

24:36.074 --> 24:37.939
<i>While our budding
kitchen chemists</i>

24:38.009 --> 24:40.807
mix things up
with a few new recipes,

24:40.879 --> 24:43.973
Jessi cooks up a bamboo cannon.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.643
So, Captain Kirk was put on
this barren wasteland.

24:46.718 --> 24:50.586
He was very lucky to find
a broken-off piece of bamboo...

24:50.655 --> 24:52.646
one that is appro ximately
the size that we've chosen here,

24:52.724 --> 24:55.090
which is a 6-inch
inside diameter.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.559
Well, the problem
that we're having here

24:56.628 --> 24:59.756
is that his piece of bamboo
didn't have these inner walls

24:59.831 --> 25:02.061
where it blocks off
all of these sections.

25:02.133 --> 25:05.500
So, what I have to do is get rid
of those inner walls.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.366
<i>The heat is on</i>

25:06.438 --> 25:09.874
to find the perfect, hand-mixed,
black-powder formula.

25:09.941 --> 25:13.604
Now, in this one, I added
more charcoal and more sulfur.

25:13.678 --> 25:17.546
After working their way through
over 30 different formulations,

25:17.616 --> 25:20.915
the guys decide they've found
the best possible combination

25:20.986 --> 25:22.681
that could be made by hand.

25:22.754 --> 25:26.349
...Hey!
... Hey.

25:26.424 --> 25:27.721
You know what?
That's not too bad.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.020
I mean, I don't know
if you'd be able to make it

25:29.094 --> 25:30.959
in 30 minutes
during the heat of the battle,

25:31.029 --> 25:33.293
but, I mean,
so far, it's looking good.

25:36.935 --> 25:40.530
You look like you're thinking
of something pretty good.

25:40.605 --> 25:41.537
I am.

25:41.606 --> 25:42.402
There's a myth going around

25:42.474 --> 25:44.965
that you can stick your hand
into molten lead

25:45.043 --> 25:46.442
and not get hurt.

25:48.847 --> 25:49.814
Molten metal...

25:49.881 --> 25:51.178
it's pretty nasty stuff.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.615
Just look at these shots
of a foundry.

25:53.685 --> 25:54.276
It would seem

25:54.352 --> 25:56.343
that, if you touched any
of that stuff with your hands,

25:56.421 --> 25:58.912
you'd be horribly,
horribly burned.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.355
But maybe not so.

26:00.425 --> 26:01.585
See, there's a myth going around

26:01.660 --> 26:04.595
that if you take pure lead
and you melt it,

26:04.663 --> 26:06.426
that you can dip your hand in it

26:06.498 --> 26:09.058
and not be burnt
or horribly injured.

26:09.134 --> 26:09.964
I know.

26:10.035 --> 26:10.694
The trick is supposed to be

26:10.769 --> 26:12.600
that you wet your hand
before doing it,

26:12.671 --> 26:17.574
and it exploits what's known
as the Leidenfrost effect.

26:17.642 --> 26:19.269
<i>The Leidenfrost effect?</i>

26:19.344 --> 26:22.336
Well, seeing as it's the
scientific basis for the myth,

26:22.414 --> 26:25.383
Adam, with his hot, steel ball
and fish tank

26:25.450 --> 26:29.910
is on demonstration duty.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.512
Wow!

26:31.590 --> 26:33.148
Look at that.

26:33.224 --> 26:35.784
You can see a clear
skin of...

26:35.860 --> 26:38.852
I guess it's steam
around the whole thing.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.227
What you're seeing
in this demonstration

26:40.298 --> 26:42.493
is known as
the Leidenfrost effect.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.762
It's like
an atmosphere.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.134
It's interesting
because the steam that's created

26:47.205 --> 26:49.969
when you expose a hot surface
to water

26:50.041 --> 26:52.475
is actually insulating
that surface.

26:52.544 --> 26:55.911
And it makes sense,
because steam being a gas,

26:55.981 --> 27:00.645
conducts heat less rapidly
than the water itself does.

27:00.719 --> 27:02.311
<i>And that's the key.</i>

27:02.387 --> 27:06.118
When cool water is exposed
to an extremely hot surface,

27:06.191 --> 27:07.783
a layer of water vapor,

27:07.859 --> 27:10.487
which is a relatively poor
heat conductor,

27:10.562 --> 27:13.463
provides a thin
protective barrier.

27:13.531 --> 27:17.934
So, it's time to get cooking
for this hair-raising stunt...

27:18.003 --> 27:19.368
Is this me?

27:19.437 --> 27:22.736
...with the one and only
ingredient... lead.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.741
Is this the first Terminator
you've ever cooked?

27:24.809 --> 27:27.175
No, I've done this
a lot before, actually...

27:27.245 --> 27:30.806
every time I get a robot
that's misbehaving.

27:30.882 --> 27:32.076
The problem is
you've got to keep them cooking,

27:32.150 --> 27:35.642
otherwise they reformulate
and try and kill you.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.484
It's about 725 degrees.

27:38.556 --> 27:41.184
Well, that's about 100 degrees
more than melting temperature.

27:41.259 --> 27:42.317
I think
that's about right.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.224
Let's do it.

27:43.294 --> 27:46.058
<i>Cue the stand-in digits.</i>

27:46.131 --> 27:49.157
This meat is raw,
and if it actually gets too hot,

27:49.234 --> 27:51.725
it's gonna change color
because it's cooking.

27:51.803 --> 27:54.499
<i>If these finger-sized
sausages sizzle,</i>

27:54.572 --> 28:00.272
then Adam and Jamie won't be
going anywhere near the hot pot.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.575
Well, now, that seems to be
a problem, doesn't it?

28:02.647 --> 28:05.707
A very slight
change of color.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.251
But, also,
lead stuck to...

28:07.318 --> 28:10.253
...I wouldn't want that to happen to my finger.
... No.

28:10.321 --> 28:14.121
<i>While not burnt by the standards
of any backyard barbecue,</i>

28:14.192 --> 28:16.353
the sausage is being cooked.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.453
But they're not giving up yet.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.998
A hair's breadth
over 800.

28:21.066 --> 28:24.001
In order to avoid
burning their stand-in digits,

28:24.069 --> 28:26.560
they're going to raise
the temperature and try again.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.005
That worked pretty well.

28:32.077 --> 28:37.071
Yeah.
Where's Tory?

28:37.148 --> 28:38.376
Gosh dang it!

28:38.450 --> 28:40.714
This is the fourth time
this week!

28:40.785 --> 28:43.185
...He needs to get a new service provider.
... Right?

28:43.254 --> 28:45.154
<i>Our intrepid trio
of trekkies</i>

28:45.223 --> 28:49.751
are tackling the tall tale
of the Gorn cannon.

28:49.828 --> 28:53.229
They want to know...
can you hand-mix black powder?

28:53.298 --> 28:56.756
Can you really build a bazooka
out of bamboo?

28:56.835 --> 28:59.599
And can the cannon fire
with enough force

28:59.671 --> 29:03.471
to take down the Gorn?

29:03.541 --> 29:05.236
We're working
with different elements here,

29:05.310 --> 29:07.710
so the chances of everything
working together...

29:07.779 --> 29:09.337
I'm thinking slim to none.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.678
The gunpowder looks promising.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.911
The bamboo, I think,
is gonna completely fail.

29:13.985 --> 29:16.249
And then the Gorn actually
being hit by diamonds?

29:16.321 --> 29:17.811
Um, not so much.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.151
Hey, nice vine
you got there.

29:19.224 --> 29:20.350
Yeah, you know,
it's amazing

29:20.425 --> 29:23.019
how it grows in three cords
here on this planet.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.392
In the episode,
Captain Kirk takes the vine

29:25.463 --> 29:28.057
and wraps it around
the bamboo bazooka

29:28.133 --> 29:29.600
at the combustion chamber.

29:29.667 --> 29:32.135
I guess that's to strengthen it
or something.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.570
All right.
I think that's tight enough.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.007
All right, now it's time
for the secret sauce.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.204
Our own formulation
of black powder.

29:41.279 --> 29:44.544
After 33 formulations,
this is the most potent.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.605
And just to remind you...

29:45.683 --> 29:48.880
this is using only the chemicals
that Kirk had on the planet,

29:48.953 --> 29:52.684
which were potassium nitrate,
sulfur, and charcoal.

29:52.757 --> 29:55.419
And speaking of
James Tiberius Kirk,

29:55.493 --> 29:57.723
here he is...
... All right, buddy, it's time.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.855
...or at least
his stunt double.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.058
...You know why he's wearing the red shirt, don't you?
... Why?

30:02.133 --> 30:03.430
Every "Star Trek" fan
knows,

30:03.501 --> 30:05.526
if you beam down to a planet
in a red shirt,

30:05.603 --> 30:06.729
you're not coming back.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.864
...Perfect.
... Yes.

30:11.276 --> 30:13.506
We are about to test
our bamboo bazooka.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.876
Is it gonna be strong enough
to withstand an explosion

30:15.947 --> 30:17.642
from our homemade
black powder?

30:17.715 --> 30:20.240
Beforehand, I measured out
an amount... two handfuls...

30:20.318 --> 30:23.879
which Kirk put in,
and that's what this cup is.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.445
And is this explosion
gonna be strong enough

30:25.523 --> 30:29.254
to launch our projectiles
into the Gorn to take him down?

30:29.327 --> 30:31.852
Load it up with the diamonds.

30:31.930 --> 30:35.195
Or is this whole thing just
gonna explode into splinters?

30:35.266 --> 30:37.734
I will be highly impressed
if this actually works.

30:37.802 --> 30:39.997
We are about to find out.

30:40.071 --> 30:43.529
All right, this is Gorn cannon,
just like in the episode.

30:43.608 --> 30:45.599
Here we go!

30:45.677 --> 30:47.611
Kiss your butt goodbye, Gorn!

30:49.514 --> 30:51.038
<i>It's quite endearing, really.</i>

30:51.115 --> 30:54.573
Grant and Tory's beaming faces
full of anticipation,

30:54.652 --> 30:59.715
childhood dreams
about to be realized.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.486
That was interesting.

31:01.559 --> 31:05.188
But unfortunately, all that hope
has gone up in smoke.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.128
I was hoping for, like,
a

31:07.198 --> 31:09.826
This is so
underwhelming.

31:09.901 --> 31:12.369
I'm sorry, guys.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.496
<i>It appears
the homemade black powder</i>

31:14.572 --> 31:17.769
doesn't burn fast
or aggressively enough.

31:17.842 --> 31:19.810
The energy
is simply dissipating

31:19.878 --> 31:21.903
rather than exploding.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.914
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm a little disappointed.

31:23.982 --> 31:26.473
All our cannon did
was smoke profusely.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.987
But I don't think, necessarily,
that it was the gunpowder.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.488
Maybe we lost containment.
I don't know.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.455
All I know is that

31:33.524 --> 31:35.924
people have been making
gunpowder this way for centuries

31:35.994 --> 31:37.985
with the exact same recipe.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.654
Careful.
It might still be hot.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.165
Maybe we should try this
in the real cannon and see if it even works.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.791
...I agree.
... All right.

31:43.868 --> 31:47.065
<i>So, our trekkie trio
isn't giving up yet.</i>

31:47.138 --> 31:50.369
To confirm it's Kirk's gunpowder
recipe that's failing

31:50.441 --> 31:52.375
and not the bamboo cannon,

31:52.443 --> 31:56.777
the team is switching in some
hardware that they know works.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.816
So, we're giving it
another shot,

31:58.883 --> 32:03.081
put it in a proper cannon,
and see how well that does.

32:03.154 --> 32:04.917
Look at him.
He's laughing at us.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.983
Here's that finger,
bucket of water...

32:08.059 --> 32:12.689
Whoo... shake it off,
into the lead.

32:12.764 --> 32:16.723
And it looks pretty much
perfect, and it's still cold.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.029
Yeah.

32:18.102 --> 32:21.936
<i>So, 850 degrees
Fahrenheit is the magic number.</i>

32:22.006 --> 32:24.372
The sausage
comes through unscathed,

32:24.442 --> 32:26.774
which leaves just one question.

32:26.844 --> 32:28.368
I'm game.
Are you game?

32:28.446 --> 32:30.107
I picture people
yelling at their TV...

32:30.181 --> 32:31.648
"Go on, do it!

32:31.716 --> 32:34.344
Go on, try it! Ha!"

32:34.419 --> 32:36.410
Aren't you?
Yeah. All right.

32:36.487 --> 32:37.579
We're about to go for it.

32:37.655 --> 32:39.646
We're about to dip our hands
into molten metal,

32:39.724 --> 32:41.919
and we've got plenty of evidence
saying that this is safe.

32:41.993 --> 32:44.860
It's clear
from our experimentation

32:44.929 --> 32:46.294
that the conditions
to do it safely

32:46.364 --> 32:48.389
are actually pretty precise.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.024
I think we've got them.

32:50.101 --> 32:53.070
And I think it's gonna be okay.

32:53.137 --> 32:56.004
And this little piggy
burned clean off.

32:57.442 --> 33:00.070
<i>Despite
the sausage-based evidence...</i>

33:00.144 --> 33:02.544
clearly a sentence
never before used...

33:02.613 --> 33:05.776
there is still
a healthy amount of trepidation.

33:05.850 --> 33:10.082
Remember, the lead is at around
450 degrees Celsius,

33:10.154 --> 33:14.784
which puts this stunt firmly in
the don't-try-at-home category.

33:18.963 --> 33:20.794
Nothing.

33:20.865 --> 33:22.924
Now, I just went
about that deep.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.992
Yeah. Do you want to go
a little deeper?

33:25.069 --> 33:27.060
My little finger
is just fine.

33:27.138 --> 33:29.800
Of course I only went in
about that deep.

33:29.874 --> 33:31.705
I was being a little careful.

33:33.811 --> 33:34.835
I didn't feel a thing.

33:34.912 --> 33:38.348
It felt kind of warm
and pleasant, actually.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.007
Go for it.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.278
<i>And a repeat
performance with an index finger</i>

33:41.352 --> 33:43.320
yields the same result.

33:43.388 --> 33:47.324
Now, that one went in
pretty good, and no problem.

33:47.392 --> 33:48.086
No problem?

33:48.159 --> 33:48.955
No problem.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.119
I guess it's my turn.

33:50.194 --> 33:53.994
Adam has had the luxury of using
Jamie as a human guinea pig,

33:54.065 --> 33:57.034
so, naturally,
he has to up the ante.

33:57.101 --> 33:59.797
He's going for four fingers.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.169
Here we go,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.208
One human hand in molten metal.

34:09.746 --> 34:10.735
That's freaky.

34:10.815 --> 34:12.908
You can feel the water
boiling against your fingers.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.246
You can feel that
right there.

34:14.318 --> 34:18.652
And that pretty much
puts this lead mini-myth to bed.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.850
So, Jamie and I just
successfully dipped our hands

34:20.925 --> 34:23.860
into a pot of molten metal.

34:23.928 --> 34:29.264
No lie. The Leidenfrost effect
is no myth. It protected us.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.391
Well, I'm unharmed.
You?

34:31.469 --> 34:32.561
I'm fine.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.730
That's all we needed.
That's a myth confirmed.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.431
Yep.

34:41.545 --> 34:42.638
So, I got the cannon out.

34:42.713 --> 34:44.510
This way we can test
our homemade black powder

34:44.581 --> 34:46.482
to see whether or not
it's even working.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.576
We've used this cannon
a lot. We know it works.

34:48.652 --> 34:51.213
I mean, we used it
on Prison Escape,

34:51.289 --> 34:55.918
and we used it
on Cheese Cannon.

34:55.993 --> 34:57.119
It punched a hole right through
the sail!

34:57.195 --> 34:58.958
So, we know the cannon works.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.554
What we're trying
to find out is...

35:00.631 --> 35:02.531
does our homemade
gunpowder work?

35:02.600 --> 35:06.536
<i>So, this test is focusing on
the homemade black powder.</i>

35:06.604 --> 35:11.541
And, once again, the team use
the same amount as Captain Kirk.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.871
You know,
if two handfuls of gunpowder

35:12.944 --> 35:15.378
don't set this cannonball off...

35:15.446 --> 35:17.311
If two... if two...

35:20.151 --> 35:22.711
<i>Let's try that again
from a safe distance.</i>

35:22.787 --> 35:24.652
You know, if two handfuls
of homemade gunpowder

35:24.722 --> 35:26.053
doesn't launch
this ball out,

35:26.124 --> 35:29.150
we might have to switch
to normal gunpowder.

35:29.227 --> 35:30.558
All right,
fuse is going in.

35:35.533 --> 35:37.330
...Whoo!
... Whoo!

35:37.401 --> 35:37.958
Look at that.

35:38.035 --> 35:40.265
The cannonball actually
ended up behind the cannon.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.101
Yep, and it clearly
demonstrates that,

35:42.173 --> 35:45.472
although, you can hand-mix the
raw ingredients of black powder

35:45.543 --> 35:47.943
to get an energetic product,

35:48.012 --> 35:50.037
you won't get
an explosive result

35:50.114 --> 35:54.517
without more accurate refinement
and measurement techniques.

35:54.585 --> 35:56.746
Look, even as a hard-core
"Star Trek" fan,

35:56.821 --> 35:58.254
I think I'm gonna
have to concede

35:58.322 --> 36:00.586
that black powder
made in two hours

36:00.658 --> 36:02.649
on the surface
of a planet with no tools

36:02.727 --> 36:03.819
just doesn't cut it.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.420
All right, but we still
have to test this bamboo cannon,

36:06.497 --> 36:08.988
so I say let's pretend
like he was able to make

36:09.066 --> 36:10.465
commercial-grade
black powder.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.765
Let's take the same amount,
load up our cannon,

36:12.837 --> 36:14.634
and see what happens.

36:14.705 --> 36:17.139
This is getting good now!

36:17.208 --> 36:18.698
Easy.
Don't go too hard.

36:18.776 --> 36:21.802
<i>But even in this
impossible, best-case scenario,</i>

36:21.879 --> 36:25.576
Tory has his doubts
the bamboo cannon can.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.914
Now, I think the weakest link
in our bamboo bazooka

36:27.985 --> 36:32.251
is the fact that we're using the
natural membrane of the bamboo

36:32.323 --> 36:33.813
as the backing of our cannon.

36:33.891 --> 36:34.858
I mean, that is gonna be taking

36:34.926 --> 36:36.894
the full force
of the black powder.

36:36.961 --> 36:40.453
I just don't think it's strong
enough to withstand that force.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.590
Aah!

36:42.667 --> 36:44.464
Run! Run!

36:48.873 --> 36:52.138
I think we killed Captain Kirk,
not the Gorn.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.235
Yeah, the Gorn
is still standing.

36:54.312 --> 36:56.337
It totally blew out
the back of the cannon.

36:56.414 --> 36:57.711
How cool was that?

36:57.782 --> 37:00.580
But, look, it's obvious
the bamboo was not strong enough

37:00.651 --> 37:03.245
to withstand the explosion
of the black powder.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.084
Blew right out the back.
Cracked it all the way up.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.056
Yeah, but it looks like it did
in the episode.

37:07.124 --> 37:09.183
Yeah, but, I mean,
look at Captain Kirk.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.057
He does not look like
he did in the episode.

37:11.128 --> 37:12.720
This guy probably
would have died.

37:12.797 --> 37:16.255
<i>And the Gorn escaped
without a scratch.</i>

37:16.334 --> 37:17.392
Or did he?

37:17.468 --> 37:19.163
He looks pretty healthy
from this angle.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.171
Yeah, he's still standing.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.536
But wait a minute.
Look at that.

37:22.607 --> 37:23.733
That looks like a hit.

37:23.808 --> 37:26.174
...No.
... Yeah, look at this.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.711
Dude, it's everywhere.
Yeah!

37:27.778 --> 37:29.712
We actually
got crystals to fire back.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.715
Yeah!

37:32.783 --> 37:33.647
You know what?

37:33.718 --> 37:35.049
I mean, this one's
still looking busted,

37:35.119 --> 37:37.019
'cause it's like...
the person shooting the cannon

37:37.088 --> 37:38.453
is gonna sustain
way more damage

37:38.522 --> 37:40.649
than the person
getting shot at.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.716
Well, how can we
make it better, though?

37:42.793 --> 37:45.159
I don't know. We could always
replicate the results.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.891
All right. But so far
as this goes, this one's busted.

37:47.965 --> 37:50.490
...Busted.
... Totally busted.

37:50.568 --> 37:53.765
<i>Okay, so the mythical
Gorn cannon is busted,</i>

37:53.838 --> 37:55.362
in more ways than one.

37:55.439 --> 37:56.497
But is there any way

37:56.574 --> 37:59.600
Kirk could have made a cannon
out of bamboo?

37:59.677 --> 38:01.941
The weak link was the membrane
in the bamboo itself,

38:02.013 --> 38:04.481
so what we've done
is we've taken 3/4-inch plywood,

38:04.548 --> 38:06.709
plugged it,
put a steel rod across,

38:06.784 --> 38:08.945
and then we're gonna put some
polyurethane sealer in there

38:09.020 --> 38:10.419
to help fill all those cracks,

38:10.488 --> 38:12.115
and, hopefully,
the explosion is gonna go out

38:12.189 --> 38:13.622
the front end of the cannon

38:13.691 --> 38:17.127
and shoot all those crystals at
the Gorn, the way we want it to.

38:22.199 --> 38:22.995
You know what?

38:23.067 --> 38:24.728
I don't care if Captain Kirk

38:24.802 --> 38:27.737
wasn't able to make homemade
black powder on the planet.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.534
I don't care
if this myth is busted.

38:29.607 --> 38:32.098
We're re-enacting the
Gorn episode, and you know what?

38:32.176 --> 38:34.804
I'm happy.

38:34.879 --> 38:36.506
I probably should
get out of here now.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.584
...Oh!
... Oh!

38:44.655 --> 38:46.213
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

38:46.290 --> 38:48.349
Hey, that was good!

38:48.426 --> 38:51.725
I think we took out
both the Gorn and Captain Kirk!

38:53.931 --> 38:59.096
<i>Finally, the team gets its Gorn
and hits the bull's-eye.</i>

38:59.170 --> 39:02.037
Shot to the head, the chest,
the stomach.

39:02.106 --> 39:03.164
And to the groin!

39:03.240 --> 39:05.208
Yeah.

39:05.276 --> 39:08.177
<i>But despite this brief
moment of satisfaction...</i>

39:08.245 --> 39:10.805
and Kirk's cult hero status...

39:10.881 --> 39:13.850
there really was only one result
for this myth.

39:13.918 --> 39:14.942
As sad as I am to say,

39:15.019 --> 39:17.078
since this is my favorite
episode of "Star Trek,"

39:17.154 --> 39:18.348
this one is busted.

39:18.422 --> 39:20.083
I mean, you cannot make
homemade black powder

39:20.157 --> 39:21.954
strong enough
to launch the projectiles.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.357
Even if you could,

39:23.427 --> 39:26.487
the bamboo would not be strong
enough to contain the explosion.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.429
I mean, giving
it the best possible chances,

39:28.499 --> 39:29.966
using the commercial-grade
black powder,

39:30.034 --> 39:31.661
and reinforcing the bamboo,

39:31.736 --> 39:35.103
our bamboo bazooka still
exploded, killing Captain Kirk.

39:35.172 --> 39:37.640
I mean, any way you look at it,
this is a bad idea.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.699
I mean, you're better off
giving it to the Gorn

39:39.777 --> 39:41.244
and letting him shoot you.

39:45.649 --> 39:47.776
You guys want to walk?
I don't want to walk.

39:47.852 --> 39:50.787
Scottie,
beam us out of here.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.117
You know what? You might
want to use yours, Grant.

39:52.189 --> 39:53.383
I'm not getting a signal.

39:54.825 --> 39:55.484
Enterprise,
four to beam up.

40:04.101 --> 40:05.500
Has anyone seen Jamie?

40:05.569 --> 40:07.901
Here I am.
Got the mail.

40:07.972 --> 40:12.170
Bill, bill, bill...

40:12.243 --> 40:13.335
Coconut.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.639
Coconut!

40:14.712 --> 40:16.009
Dude, our coconut
came back!

40:16.080 --> 40:17.911
...Do you know what this means?
... What?

40:17.982 --> 40:19.882
This means
myth confirmed.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.510
It also means we're gonna get
a lot of coconuts in the mail.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.214
Oh, you're right.
Nuts!
