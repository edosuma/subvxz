Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.219 --> 00:03.438
What the hell
are you doing?

00:03.481 --> 00:05.179
You know I have
what you need

00:05.222 --> 00:06.397
and I'll give you the rest

00:06.441 --> 00:08.443
after I know that
Sofia, LJ--

00:08.486 --> 00:10.010
they're all safe.

00:15.406 --> 00:18.322
My book... my book!

00:18.366 --> 00:20.411
Get up!

00:21.412 --> 00:22.805
What is this place?

00:22.848 --> 00:24.937
Where we're gonna make
the exchange-- on our terms.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.375
LINCOLN:
An abandoned warehouse
five miles down the road.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.159
Be there in 20 minutes
with my son.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.509
They must've closed all
the roads out of Panama.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.163
Papa, what do we do?

00:33.207 --> 00:35.426
Whistler still pretending
he's a fisherman and all this?

00:37.341 --> 00:38.821
I don't care what he says!

00:38.864 --> 00:41.041
I don't know anything about
this Michael Scofield guy!

00:41.084 --> 00:44.783
You sure you don't want to
change your story... Fernando?

00:45.654 --> 00:47.482
I guess this is where
I say good-bye.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.005
[glass shattering]

00:51.486 --> 00:53.096
Hey! My truck!

00:54.663 --> 00:55.838
No!

00:58.058 --> 01:00.190
What are we gonna do now?

01:04.455 --> 01:08.894
[engine revving,

01:17.512 --> 01:21.211
[tires screeching,

[horn honking]

01:35.530 --> 01:36.835

[panting]

02:44.425 --> 02:46.514
[door chimes jingling]

02:46.557 --> 02:48.907
Do you have
a cell phone?

02:53.303 --> 02:54.348
Gracias.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.613
[panting]

02:58.656 --> 02:59.918
[phone rings]

02:59.962 --> 03:01.616
I lost them. You need to come
and pick me up.

03:01.659 --> 03:02.573
Where are you?

03:07.535 --> 03:08.449
[groans]

03:10.015 --> 03:11.060
Let me guess.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.759
If anything happens to him...

03:14.803 --> 03:16.631
That depends, doesn't it?[groans, coughs]

03:16.674 --> 03:19.416
SUSAN B.:
I'm at the warehouse,
like you said.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.678
Where are you?

03:20.722 --> 03:22.898
Chasing your buddy--
where do you think I am?

03:22.941 --> 03:24.334
Why don't you get back here.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.380
I have LJ and Sofia.
I'm ready to do the exchange.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.382
I'll call you back.What?!

03:28.425 --> 03:30.340
[gasping]The plan's shot.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.342
She's already there.All right.
So now what?

03:32.386 --> 03:34.301
It took me two weeks to hook up
that warehouse.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.911
We'll figure
something out.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.565
I can fix this.
That's what I was trying to do.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.306
You were calling them
to pick you up.

03:39.349 --> 03:42.309
So no one else would get hurt!

03:42.352 --> 03:45.573
You really think I would
put anyone's life at risk?

03:45.616 --> 03:46.487
You already have.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.272
[sirens approaching]

04:02.720 --> 04:04.461
I-I can't go back
to Sona, Papa!

04:04.505 --> 04:06.463
I can't!

04:06.507 --> 04:08.509
ALPHONSO: You're not
going back to Sona.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.424
[officers speaking Spanish]

04:18.954 --> 04:22.000
[indistinct radio dispatch]

04:38.452 --> 04:40.410
No...

05:16.577 --> 05:19.493
[breathes weakly]

05:25.934 --> 05:27.544
Do you want some water?

05:27.588 --> 05:31.418
Or do you want to tell me
where Michael Scofield is?

05:31.461 --> 05:34.203
I don't know where he is.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.382
[annoyed sigh]

05:42.516 --> 05:46.302
You know, from the first
day you started here,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.435
I knew there was something off
about you.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.396
I guess I just know a con
when I see one, huh?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.486
Maybe you'll get to be
Employee of the Month.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.244
[speaks Spanish]

06:26.821 --> 06:28.170
[phone rings]

06:30.520 --> 06:31.521
I'm waiting.

06:31.565 --> 06:32.870
There's been a change
in venue.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.306
Oh, well, well, well.

06:34.350 --> 06:37.484
I finally get to talk
to the brains of the outfit.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.355
We're at the Plaza de Francia.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.923
So you're thinking public place,
safety in numbers,

06:41.966 --> 06:43.446
plenty of witnesses
to protect you.

06:43.490 --> 06:47.624
I'm thinking public place,
wanted men, police,

06:47.668 --> 06:49.757
lots of witnesses
to identify you.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.107
Plaza de Francia.
Ten minutes.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.196
Be alone.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.678
Round everyone up.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.757
[inmates clamoring]

07:52.733 --> 07:55.039
It's anarchy in here!
We gotta hide!

07:55.083 --> 07:56.519
I gotta--
I gotta help him.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.303
BELLICK:
He's the most hated
person in here.

07:58.347 --> 07:59.914
If we start rubbin'
elbows with him again,
then we're gonna...

07:59.957 --> 08:01.219
He gave me a home!

08:01.263 --> 08:02.743
He gave me third-degree
burns down my back!

08:02.786 --> 08:03.918
He can go to hell!

08:03.961 --> 08:06.834
I owe him this much.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.575
You don't want to help,
then don't.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.404
Get out of here!
Shoo fly, ciao!

08:12.448 --> 08:13.928
[angry grunt]

08:13.971 --> 08:16.365
[groaning]

08:20.456 --> 08:22.850
Just a few more steps,
patrón, a few more.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.242
Then it's home,
sweet home...

[objects clattering
in back room]

08:35.993 --> 08:36.994
Hey!

08:37.038 --> 08:38.648
[weak, raspy]:
This is my house!

08:38.692 --> 08:39.606
[laughs]

08:47.483 --> 08:49.311
Whoa! Whoa!

08:49.354 --> 08:51.661
Easy, now.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.184
Get out!

08:57.885 --> 08:59.408
Come on now.

09:02.716 --> 09:03.978
[coughing]

09:05.632 --> 09:07.503
[gasping, groaning weakly]

09:15.206 --> 09:17.078
He's gonna
get us killed.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.428
He's gonna get us
out of here.

[horns honking]

09:35.575 --> 09:37.751
[Spanish song playing]

09:37.794 --> 09:39.361
Buenas.

09:46.673 --> 09:47.804
What can I get you?

09:47.848 --> 09:50.546
Club soda.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.602
You been to
Panama before?

10:04.560 --> 10:05.735
First time.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.651
What did you do back, uh,
in the States?

10:12.481 --> 10:15.484
I-I'm in sort of a transitional
period right now.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.662
In between jobs.

10:19.706 --> 10:23.013
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.537
Yeah, we've all been there.

10:25.581 --> 10:28.453
I'm sure something will
come up before long.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.673
I'm hoping it's right around
the corner.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.467
[Sucre grunting, huffing]

11:10.017 --> 11:13.455
You're gonna give me
some real information
on Michael Scofield,

11:13.498 --> 11:15.457
or it's gonna be
your funeral.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.982
I don't know where he is.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.071
I don't know how to
reach him, I swear.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.424
[gun cocking]

11:26.468 --> 11:28.644
Well, which one
is it gonna be, papi?

11:33.910 --> 11:36.957
[indistinct, lively chatter]

11:50.666 --> 11:52.668
Hello, Gretchen.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.278
Where's Whistler?

11:54.322 --> 11:55.976
Over my right shoulder.

12:00.241 --> 12:03.940
You know, you're the first
to ever break out of Sona?

12:03.984 --> 12:05.899
Where are they?

12:08.118 --> 12:09.990
Bring them out.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.601
I've worked with a lot
of intelligent people

12:12.644 --> 12:14.864
in this business,
Michael, but you...

12:14.908 --> 12:17.388
Maybe you wouldn't have to worry
about the Company trying

12:17.432 --> 12:19.739
to kill you if you were
on their side.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.044
They certainly pay well.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.228
SUSAN B.:
There they are.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.710
Give me Whistler and
I will give you LJ.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.413
Hey.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.722
If you move, you're dead.

12:49.681 --> 12:50.987
AGENT [over radio]:
Wait for hand-off.

12:51.031 --> 12:51.945
Roger that.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.788
SUSAN B.:
What the hell
is he doing?

13:08.831 --> 13:09.832
AGENT:
I've lost him.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.138
This is not the point

13:11.181 --> 13:12.922
of the exchange. This
is just a confirmation

13:12.966 --> 13:13.967
that everyone's
still alive.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.707
They're alive.
Let's trade.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.361
You'll get a call
in five minutes

13:17.405 --> 13:19.320
telling you where
to go next.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.061
And when the exchange is over

13:21.104 --> 13:22.845
and LJ is safe,

13:22.889 --> 13:26.196
you and I are gonna spend
some quality time.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.896
When the exchange is over,

13:29.939 --> 13:31.680
you'd better run for your life.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.665
[tapping]

14:55.764 --> 14:57.113
Gracias, Papa.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.637
One more stop.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.659
[panting]

15:21.703 --> 15:24.010
There's a storm brewing
out there in the yard.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.185
[panting]

15:25.228 --> 15:26.229
You tell them...

15:26.273 --> 15:27.839
Come in.
I'm not scared.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.189
Well, I am.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.323
You might want
to put that down.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.897
[yells]

15:45.292 --> 15:46.597
[exhales sharply]

15:50.210 --> 15:52.299
Oh, Teodoro.

15:52.342 --> 15:55.302
You're the last one
I'd expect to see at my side.

15:55.345 --> 15:58.261
I take offense, patrón.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.567
I've had many
foot-washers.

15:59.610 --> 16:03.310
Many men have come in
with sheep's clothing,

16:03.353 --> 16:04.485
only to let the wolf come out.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.704
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.[tosses bottle]

16:08.315 --> 16:11.535
I am not trying to hurt you.
I am trying to save you.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.233
Save me?

16:13.276 --> 16:14.799
I'm gonna die here.

16:14.843 --> 16:17.802
Your life is in jeopardy
just being with me.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.631
Not necessarily.

16:20.675 --> 16:24.157
As I was being escorted back
inside today, one of the guards

16:24.200 --> 16:27.987
offered us a chance
to buy our freedom.[coughs]

16:28.030 --> 16:31.164
If a guard spoke to you,
he was lying.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.252
It's impossible to get out.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.731
[coughs]

16:33.775 --> 16:36.125
Maybe you've been too
busy dying to notice,

16:36.169 --> 16:38.345
but there's a new colonel
outside those gates.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.782
Little Suzy Sona ain't
playing so hard

16:40.825 --> 16:43.263
to get no more.
She has her price.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.265
And we gonna
need some money.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.049
No.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.268
No.

16:48.311 --> 16:52.141
Then you will die in here.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.278
[distant phone ringing]

17:00.628 --> 17:02.369
The lobby of the Museum
of Antiquities.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.587
SUSAN B.:
Why?

17:03.631 --> 17:06.373
Because that's
where Whistler is.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.244
You're overthinking things.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.854
I've seen it
too many times before.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.596
The first plan goes to hell,
and then you start tap-dancing.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.077
And, trust me,
it always ends badly.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.687
You have five minutes.

17:27.002 --> 17:31.093
[metal detector beeping]

17:32.442 --> 17:34.140
Unbelievable.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.450
You know what to do.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.501
What's so funny?

17:47.544 --> 17:48.632
You.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.460
Thinking you can
outsmart my uncle.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.464
[chuckles]

17:55.552 --> 17:56.858
Walk.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.518
[phone ringing]

18:07.564 --> 18:09.044
Metal detectors.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.307
And here I thought we were
building a circle of trust.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.310
Come to the southwest
corner of the first floor.

18:14.354 --> 18:15.485
SUSAN B.:
Fine.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.313
But that's it.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.794
No more stops
on your guided tour.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.709
If I don't walk out
of here with Whistler,

18:21.752 --> 18:23.493
I'm gonna snap LJ's neck.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.365
And yes, I can do it.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.891
Here we go.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.547
Is everyone in position?

18:33.590 --> 18:34.896
Roger that.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.379
Last bottle of rum.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.425
Good-bye, patrón.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.688
[grunts and groans]

18:44.732 --> 18:46.299
How much do they want?

18:48.388 --> 18:49.998
$50,000.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.088
Oh... no.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.656
We're not in Tijuana
haggling over a blanket.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.484
We're talking about your life!

18:57.527 --> 19:01.488
Even if I could...
find the money,

19:01.531 --> 19:03.533
who could I trust
to bring it in?

19:05.274 --> 19:06.406
[gasping]

19:06.449 --> 19:09.104
There is one person.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.199
How do you know James?

19:17.243 --> 19:19.332
You're working my last
nerve. Move your ass.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.256
Relax.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.956
Everybody stays cool and
we will all walk out of here.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.611
As soon as we get LJ,
you get Whistler.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.968
But LJ comes
to us first.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.585
Go ahead.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.588
LJ.

20:08.381 --> 20:11.079
Thank God, you're safe.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.523
Come on.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.264
What about the coordinates?

20:22.308 --> 20:25.311
SOFIA:
You said first thing
you would do once

20:25.354 --> 20:27.965
you had Whistler was to get
the rest of the coordinates.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.491
Is she serious?

20:35.582 --> 20:37.192
I'll give her exactly
what she wants

20:37.236 --> 20:38.454
when we get out of here.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.674
But darling, it's not safe.
We need to go.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.980
I want to see them!

20:48.029 --> 20:49.291
Sofia, come on.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.597
Let's get out of here.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.033
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.295
Sofia.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.341
You wrote those numbers
on a piece of paper.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.603
I gave her half at Sona.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.169
I promised to give her
the other half now.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.084
I know what I said,
and we'll discuss it later.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.564
WHISTLER: Come on.Welcome to the real world.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.131
I'm sick of jumping
through hoops

21:03.174 --> 21:04.611
to keep your princess
in a bubble.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.482
It is time to go.This is between us.

21:06.526 --> 21:07.527
Where are the
coordinates, Susan?

21:07.570 --> 21:10.312
There are no coordinates.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.239
WHISTLER:
Sofia.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.462
Come on.

21:32.769 --> 21:33.727
Sofia.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.077
Huh.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.645
Sofia.

21:38.688 --> 21:39.689
SUSAN B:
James.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.169
Stop kidding yourself.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.388
It's time to leave.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.353
And what the hell
are you still doing here?

21:51.397 --> 21:54.008
If I were you and I couldn't
bring weapons inside,

21:54.051 --> 21:55.705
I'd have agents at every exit

21:55.749 --> 21:58.229
ready to shoot
as soon as we stepped outside.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.709
Well, then it
really doesn't matter

21:59.753 --> 22:01.711
what exit you take, does it?

22:01.755 --> 22:03.191
I'm gonna go out that door.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.802
Maybe you should
take that door.

22:05.846 --> 22:08.109
MICHAEL:
Actually,

22:08.152 --> 22:11.678
that door is locked
in the event of an emergency.

22:11.721 --> 22:12.983
What emergency?

22:13.027 --> 22:14.507
This one.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.293
[alarm blaring]

22:18.337 --> 22:22.079
[woman making announcement
in Spanish over P.A.]

22:22.123 --> 22:24.386
We're all walking out of here.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.432
[alarm continues blaring]

22:26.475 --> 22:27.781
Together.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.788
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
May I have your attention,
please...

22:34.831 --> 22:36.659
[announcement continues
indistinctly over P.A.]

22:36.703 --> 22:40.663
[alarm blaring]That's very dramatic,
calling the cops on yourself.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.230
You must really want
to go back to Sona.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.884
They're not looking
for a con, Gretchen,

22:43.927 --> 22:45.364
they're looking for a thief.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.279
Whatever I told you,
it was always to protect you.

22:48.323 --> 22:52.283
Now, you'll understand,
if you just let me explain.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.503
[grunting and panting]

22:58.638 --> 23:01.336
[speaks Spanish]

23:06.776 --> 23:07.647
[speaks Spanish]

23:10.345 --> 23:12.347
All this because
I knew Michael Scofield?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.653
Tell me where he is.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.524
I don't know!

23:16.569 --> 23:17.657
[gun cocking]

23:17.700 --> 23:19.789
[shouts in Spanish]

23:24.403 --> 23:26.448
Even if I knew...

23:35.196 --> 23:36.458
[speaks Spanish]

23:38.504 --> 23:42.421
[murmuring softly]

23:48.427 --> 23:50.603
[Lechero panting]

23:56.652 --> 23:57.610
[phone rings]

23:58.741 --> 23:59.873
Yes?

23:59.916 --> 24:01.396
[Lechero groans]

24:02.789 --> 24:05.531
All right.

24:05.574 --> 24:08.229
It'll be here shortly.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.057
[panting]

24:10.100 --> 24:12.189
Now that we have the money,

24:12.233 --> 24:15.541
how do we get it to the guard?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.631
We don't.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.334
What do you mean, we don't?
We-we-we were supposed

24:26.377 --> 24:28.858
to bribe the guard--
that was the plan!

24:33.297 --> 24:34.516
Uh-uh.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.478
This is the plan.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.784
T-BAG:
This is business.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.483
You, of all people,
should understand.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.097
Help me hold him down.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.794
What the hell you talking about?

24:51.838 --> 24:53.448
Do it.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.233
Do it!

24:57.321 --> 24:59.019
Teodoro...

24:59.062 --> 25:01.804
Teodoro...
Teodoro...

25:01.848 --> 25:03.589
Teodoro...

25:04.590 --> 25:07.636
[groans]: It's just a matter
of time, anyway.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.249
[Lechero coughing]

25:12.293 --> 25:15.557
But from one thief to another...

25:16.819 --> 25:18.647
...out of respect,

25:18.691 --> 25:21.607
make it quick.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.655
If you don't fight me,

25:26.699 --> 25:28.570
I will.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.841
[grunts in pain]

25:41.844 --> 25:44.368
Adios, homey.

25:44.412 --> 25:46.719
[Lechero grunts]

25:47.894 --> 25:49.504
[grunting]

25:49.548 --> 25:53.334
[grunting, gasping]

25:57.773 --> 26:00.602
[muffled yells]

26:05.868 --> 26:06.652
[yelling stops]

26:31.502 --> 26:32.982
Over here.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.116
WHISTLER:
What's the problem?

26:36.159 --> 26:38.031
I found this
in his pocket.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.860
Would you care

26:40.903 --> 26:41.774
to explain this?

26:41.817 --> 26:45.560
I've got no idea
what it is.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.041
It's plastic.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.651
It's from
the gift ship.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.653
Now, if you'll
excuse us.

26:51.697 --> 26:52.828
Ah.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.090
What?

26:54.134 --> 26:55.309
Stay where you are.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.441
Why?Where is your identification?

26:57.485 --> 26:58.660
[exasperated sigh]

26:59.922 --> 27:02.011
[cocks pistol]

27:06.712 --> 27:07.582

27:10.280 --> 27:13.588
[gunshot][people screaming]

27:15.677 --> 27:17.374
Sofia!

27:19.594 --> 27:22.510
[screaming continues]

27:23.990 --> 27:25.034
[yells]

27:28.255 --> 27:29.604
Sofia!

27:33.695 --> 27:36.045
LJ:
Dad, Dad...
You can't do this.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.525
You can't do this.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.309
The cops are gonna start
asking questions. You gotta go.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.659
I'm not going.
I'm not leaving.

27:44.793 --> 27:47.013
SUSAN B:
What are you gonna do, James?
You go back,

27:47.056 --> 27:50.712
you'll get arrested, and that
won't do any of us any good.

27:55.238 --> 27:58.328
I ought to kill you right now
for what you've done to her!

27:58.372 --> 27:59.416
Enough!

28:02.681 --> 28:05.335
I did what I had to do
to get you out, period!

28:05.379 --> 28:08.469
You remember
what's at stake, James.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.994
We're moving.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.086
[cocks pistol]

28:30.056 --> 28:30.883

[tires squealing]

28:38.542 --> 28:39.369
[gunshot]

28:40.414 --> 28:42.677
Stop the van.
I can't leave her.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.983
She already left you.

28:45.549 --> 28:49.292
LJ:
Dad... [mutters]
Dad, you've got to go!

28:49.336 --> 28:50.903
Hey, I'll stay with her!

28:50.946 --> 28:52.078
I promise.

28:52.121 --> 28:53.296
You've got to go.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.907
Dad?

28:54.950 --> 28:56.778
Go! Go![Sofia groaning]

29:03.176 --> 29:04.612
Hey, can I get some help?

29:06.179 --> 29:07.006
Do you have everything?

29:07.049 --> 29:09.748
The book is gone.

29:11.184 --> 29:12.925
What do you mean, gone?

29:17.625 --> 29:19.888
Is it true?

29:21.890 --> 29:23.849
Lechero...

29:23.892 --> 29:25.198
he's...

29:25.241 --> 29:26.982
he's really...

29:27.026 --> 29:28.418
[quietly]:
Yeah.

29:33.554 --> 29:36.383
How do you want me
to give you this?

29:36.426 --> 29:38.385
The guards,
they won't

29:38.428 --> 29:40.256
let me in anymore.I only want

29:40.300 --> 29:43.216
what I asked for.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.522
Hold onto the rest
for a few days.

29:51.572 --> 29:54.183
If you were to
consider leaving

29:54.227 --> 29:55.619
with all that, well...

29:55.663 --> 29:59.232
I just want you to know
I'd be very cross with you.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.276
I've been known to have

30:00.320 --> 30:03.192
a bit of a temper problem...

30:03.236 --> 30:05.238
when betrayed.

30:06.456 --> 30:07.544
No.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.982
A deal's a deal.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.158
You've done
so much for me.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.986
You have my word.

30:16.379 --> 30:19.556
[whispers]:
Wait.

30:22.690 --> 30:23.996
[sighs]

30:24.039 --> 30:25.519
No, no.

30:25.562 --> 30:28.087
It's okay.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.668
I'll wait for you.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.309
You ready?

31:23.272 --> 31:25.057
[happy shouts, clapping]

31:33.152 --> 31:34.283
[sighs]:
Ay...

31:35.763 --> 31:37.286
[shouting happily]

31:38.287 --> 31:39.723
I'm all right.

Where is Michael Scofield?

Where is
Michael Scofield?

[speaks Spanish]

32:19.198 --> 32:21.243
[phone rings]

32:21.287 --> 32:23.245
Espera!

32:26.248 --> 32:29.164
If it's him...

32:29.208 --> 32:31.427
you're gonna find out
where they are,

32:31.471 --> 32:33.081
or I'm gonna answer it myself,

32:33.125 --> 32:36.258
so they can hear you scream
when I blow your head off.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.391
[ringing continues]

32:46.051 --> 32:47.313
Hello?

32:47.356 --> 32:48.575
Sucre. Thank God.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.490
When you didn't show up
at the boat, I...

32:50.533 --> 32:52.318
I'm really sorry
about that, papi.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.711
I got into a little bit of
trouble here at work.

32:54.755 --> 32:57.149
MICHAEL:
Are you all right?

32:58.237 --> 32:59.803
Yeah.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.283
Where are you?

33:01.327 --> 33:02.937
You guys get LJ?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.330
Yeah. He... he's fine.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.809
What about Linc?

33:05.853 --> 33:07.072
Is he okay?

33:07.115 --> 33:08.334
He's fine.

33:08.377 --> 33:11.206
Are you sure you're all right?

33:11.250 --> 33:12.903
I'm fine.

33:12.947 --> 33:16.037
It all worked out.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.432
I'm about to catch
the bus, papi. Take care.

33:22.609 --> 33:23.131
Okay.

33:26.352 --> 33:29.355
Kill me if you want.

33:29.398 --> 33:32.314
Wrong, papi.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.795
You're gonna wish we had.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.810
Lechero is dead!

33:51.029 --> 33:54.206
[inmates murmuring]

33:54.249 --> 33:56.817
T-BAG:
Lechero is dead!

33:57.905 --> 34:02.083
I come before you now
to bury the man...

34:04.433 --> 34:06.348
...not to praise him,

34:06.392 --> 34:08.872
for there is nothing
praiseworthy

34:08.916 --> 34:11.484
about his rule here.

34:11.527 --> 34:15.879
Having one of our own
dictate to us?

34:15.923 --> 34:18.317
Well, that's just not
the natural order.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.582
All cons are equal!

34:22.625 --> 34:26.803
INMATES [cheering]:
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

34:28.762 --> 34:32.374
I have the last remnants...

34:32.418 --> 34:36.378
of Lechero's cruel empire
in my hand.

34:38.163 --> 34:42.471
An empire which I willingly
participated in

34:42.515 --> 34:45.387
and witnessed first-hand.
