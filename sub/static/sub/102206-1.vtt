WEBVTT

01:54.798 --> 01:58.568
Hey. Dad, Dad.

01:58.601 --> 02:00.603
Hey, what's up?

02:00.636 --> 02:03.573
Sheppard's falling behind again.
He's exhausted, showed up late,

02:03.606 --> 02:05.173
putting the rest of the guys
in danger.

02:05.206 --> 02:08.110
- Well, his brother's sick.
- He's a good kid, but one man

02:08.144 --> 02:09.779
doesn't take precedent
over the team.

02:09.811 --> 02:11.147
Let me talk to him.

02:11.179 --> 02:12.813
I'm gonna have to let him go.

02:12.846 --> 02:15.117
Dad, you just said so yourself,
he's a good kid.

02:15.149 --> 02:17.185
Come on,
just let me talk to him.

02:19.588 --> 02:22.624
Go get your tools.
I'll meet you in the truck.

02:26.894 --> 02:28.294
Ah! Dad!

02:28.328 --> 02:30.796
- Eric?
- Please! Please! Help me! Dad!

02:30.830 --> 02:32.699
Eric! Eric!

02:34.266 --> 02:36.602
- Dad! Dad!
- What the fuck?

02:36.634 --> 02:38.937
I got you, I got you.

02:40.005 --> 02:42.206
Dad! Please. Dad. Dad.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.909
Dad!

02:49.245 --> 02:51.881
Dad!
Please, please, help me, Dad.

02:53.283 --> 02:55.351
- Dad!
- Eric!

02:57.087 --> 02:58.721
Eric.

03:01.089 --> 03:03.124
Eric!

03:08.062 --> 03:09.196
Dad!

05:00.893 --> 05:02.228
<i>Hello, Arianne.</i>

05:02.261 --> 05:05.031
<i>It's Darren Atkins again.</i>

05:05.064 --> 05:06.766
<i>The team and I
are all set for the trip,</i>

05:06.799 --> 05:08.168
<i>our gear is ready,</i>

05:08.200 --> 05:09.935
<i>and we packed
as light as possible,</i>

05:09.969 --> 05:11.971
<i>so we're only bringing
essential equipment.</i>

05:14.005 --> 05:15.773
<i>Okay.
I'm excited to get going,</i>

05:15.807 --> 05:18.343
<i>and looking forward
to meeting you in person.</i>

05:18.376 --> 05:20.078
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:19.563 --> 06:21.765
Are we close?

06:40.282 --> 06:42.317
- All right, excuse me. What?
- Come on, man,

06:42.350 --> 06:44.819
- let the woman drive.
- I'm letting her drive.

06:44.851 --> 06:46.853
We exited the freeway
four hours ago.

06:46.887 --> 06:48.923
Okay, none of these roads
are on the maps.

06:48.956 --> 06:50.992
We don't have any signal.
I just...

06:51.024 --> 06:52.792
Want to continually attack
her professionalism.

06:54.227 --> 06:55.561
Well?

06:55.595 --> 06:57.130
Is there anything I could do

06:57.162 --> 06:59.198
to maybe facilitate
your driving?

06:59.232 --> 07:02.101
You could shut up, amigo.

07:02.133 --> 07:04.869
Okay. Hey, look, this isn't
meant to be a criticism,

07:04.902 --> 07:07.239
but how do you know
where we're going?

07:09.206 --> 07:10.808
I was raised by wolves.

07:12.175 --> 07:14.545
Sarcasm is gonna get us there
quicker.

07:14.579 --> 07:16.246
You know, I'm curious,
Arianne,

07:16.279 --> 07:18.816
how many of the expeditions
you've aided

07:18.849 --> 07:21.585
have had
a scientific objective?

07:21.618 --> 07:23.387
With all due respect, sir,

07:23.419 --> 07:25.988
I don't discuss my clients
with other clients.

07:28.122 --> 07:29.959
I hope you'll consider that
an asset.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.294
Yes, of course.

07:31.327 --> 07:33.561
Although I hope
that this will be an expedition

07:33.595 --> 07:37.398
we will all want to talk about
for years to come.

07:37.431 --> 07:40.801
I'm just here to get you
to where you need to go.

07:42.168 --> 07:43.837
Fair enough.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.627
This looks promising.

08:10.661 --> 08:12.128
Maybe we can get a postcard.

08:17.032 --> 08:19.534
I'm getting hungry.
Anyone else getting hungry?

08:34.148 --> 08:35.949
Wait here, I won't be long.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.484
Copy.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.955
You okay?

08:43.189 --> 08:44.524
All right.

09:22.022 --> 09:23.157
Excuse me, sir.

09:24.692 --> 09:27.962
I'd like to buy some water
for the five of us

09:27.995 --> 09:31.199
and some coolant for the car,
if you have it?

09:34.299 --> 09:36.936
Also,
I'm looking for directions.

09:36.970 --> 09:39.538
We've been tracking the river
for a couple of hours

09:39.571 --> 09:41.572
past Peaks Mill, South Pike.

09:41.605 --> 09:45.009
But I can't seem to find
where I need to go.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.544
Where'd that be?

09:47.644 --> 09:48.979
Shookum Hills.

09:51.749 --> 09:53.551
I ain't never heard of it.

09:53.584 --> 09:54.953
Old mountain town,

09:54.985 --> 09:56.286
used to be around here

09:56.319 --> 09:58.522
until it burned down
to the ground,

09:58.555 --> 10:00.291
back in the '70s.

10:01.757 --> 10:04.459
I'm working off an atlas
from 1972 out there,

10:04.492 --> 10:07.496
and on any map after that
it seems like the town

10:07.529 --> 10:10.399
was literally
wiped off the face of the earth.

10:10.431 --> 10:14.435
Any help you could offer
will be much appreciated.

10:15.736 --> 10:18.173
You go back
the way you came.

10:18.206 --> 10:19.974
You'll reach the freeway.

10:20.006 --> 10:23.743
Stay on that
till you get back to your city.

10:23.777 --> 10:26.047
You'll be fine.

10:30.215 --> 10:31.685
Great.

10:34.220 --> 10:35.988
Thanks.

10:47.597 --> 10:50.067
Dale. We've got a problem.

10:50.099 --> 10:51.433
So?

10:51.467 --> 10:52.668
We're close.

10:52.702 --> 10:54.269
- Let's go.
- All right.

10:54.303 --> 10:56.472
Well it's about time.

11:00.475 --> 11:03.045
Did they have any food in there?

11:16.656 --> 11:17.992
We should go back.

11:19.459 --> 11:20.660
What's that, Shawn?

11:20.693 --> 11:22.429
It's not here.

11:22.462 --> 11:24.330
Let's go back.

11:24.362 --> 11:27.065
The fact it's not
here is the reason we are.

11:27.098 --> 11:28.501
We shouldn't be here.

11:30.068 --> 11:31.203
Right.

11:32.837 --> 11:35.673
Right, we should go back.
We should throw two years

11:35.706 --> 11:37.274
- of research...
- Hang on.

11:37.308 --> 11:39.710
What are you doing?

11:39.743 --> 11:41.478
- Hey!
- Jesus! What the fuck!

11:41.510 --> 11:42.645
We're not alone.

11:45.382 --> 11:47.416
- Friendly escort?
- Not likely.

11:47.450 --> 11:48.718
Hold on.

11:50.518 --> 11:52.421
Hey, slow down.

11:52.455 --> 11:54.323
- Come on, slow down!
- Hang on.

11:54.355 --> 11:56.624
No, I'm serious,
slow the fuck down!

11:57.724 --> 11:59.660
Can you lose them?

12:07.366 --> 12:09.135
- I'm being serious.
- Relax.

12:09.169 --> 12:11.504
- We're going too fast.
- Slow down!

12:11.537 --> 12:12.773
She's got this.

12:19.744 --> 12:21.279
Nice driving, Arianne.

12:33.791 --> 12:35.492
Are you trying
to get us killed?

12:35.525 --> 12:36.860
Doing what I'm paid to do.

12:36.892 --> 12:38.728
You paying her
to get us killed?

12:38.761 --> 12:41.432
It's fine, she knows
what she's doing, all right?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.169
There you go.

12:47.202 --> 12:48.770
What was that?

12:48.804 --> 12:50.606
That was an escort.

12:50.639 --> 12:54.341
They wanted to push us past one
very specific point in the road.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.443
All right,
so what are you saying?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.879
That spot where he slowed down,

12:58.913 --> 13:00.714
that's where we need to go.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.758
It should be close.

13:13.791 --> 13:16.694
Look for openings
and sidetracks.

13:19.863 --> 13:21.232
Guys, look.

13:21.266 --> 13:23.234
Up there to the right.

14:05.571 --> 14:07.273
This is it.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.342
Stop. Don't touch it.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.509
It's electrified.

14:15.645 --> 14:16.881
All right.

14:24.620 --> 14:26.389
Darren.

14:26.422 --> 14:28.723
Why put up an electric fence
in the middle of nowhere?

14:28.757 --> 14:30.193
They want to keep us out.

14:30.225 --> 14:31.826
This doesn't feel right.

14:31.859 --> 14:34.596
We need to find
our way around this gate.

14:34.630 --> 14:37.199
Those branches
are too thin to climb.

14:37.232 --> 14:39.733
Or your ass is too big.

14:39.766 --> 14:41.703
Really, man?
Six percent body fat.

14:41.736 --> 14:44.871
Yeah, right.
How do you know that?

14:44.904 --> 14:46.774
Hey, Arianne?

15:08.726 --> 15:10.595
Let's go.

16:14.783 --> 16:17.787
This is a good spot, guys.

16:17.820 --> 16:19.954
So, what do we have
to worry about out here?

16:19.988 --> 16:21.957
Is this shit like quicksand
or what?

16:21.989 --> 16:23.591
A sinkhole...

16:23.624 --> 16:26.695
is formed when
an underground cavity collapses.

16:27.828 --> 16:29.297
They've been known

16:29.329 --> 16:30.530
to swallow livestock,

16:30.564 --> 16:32.400
people, cars, even houses.

16:32.433 --> 16:35.735
Many were formed by coal seams
that catch fire

16:35.768 --> 16:38.404
and collapse
as the coal smolders.

16:38.438 --> 16:40.939
- So that's what happened here?
- No, we don't know yet.

16:40.972 --> 16:42.708
There are hundreds
of coal seam fires

16:42.741 --> 16:43.975
throughout the world.

16:44.009 --> 16:46.312
Some were ignited
through natural processes.

16:46.345 --> 16:49.782
Others were brought on by men
in mining accidents.

16:49.815 --> 16:52.917
And then
there's Shookum Hills.

16:52.950 --> 16:56.787
We know there was a fire,
but not what caused it,

16:56.821 --> 16:58.988
We know there was a town here,
not why it vanished.

16:59.022 --> 17:02.658
- And we know there were miners.
- If they were miners.

17:02.691 --> 17:03.859
And I'm out.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.728
- Really?
- What do you mean if?

17:06.795 --> 17:08.663
Here we go.

17:08.696 --> 17:10.065
Well, the prevailing theory

17:10.098 --> 17:13.368
is that this was never
actually a coal mine,

17:13.402 --> 17:16.471
but America's response
to the Well to Hell.

17:17.939 --> 17:20.742
The Kola Borehole
in Siberia.

17:22.143 --> 17:23.644
The Russians
decided to drill

17:23.676 --> 17:25.611
the deepest borehole
in the world

17:25.644 --> 17:27.647
- and they did, supposedly.
- Okay.

17:27.681 --> 17:29.549
They dug 8 miles
straight down

17:29.583 --> 17:30.950
until the drill broke.

17:30.982 --> 17:33.418
Then they lowered
a heat resistant microphone

17:33.451 --> 17:37.356
into the well
where they recorded this sound.

17:48.664 --> 17:50.533
What the hell was that?

17:50.566 --> 17:53.770
Some say
it's the screams of the damned.

17:55.004 --> 17:57.040
Echoes, distorted echoes

17:57.072 --> 18:00.110
of slight underground grinding
of tectonic plates,

18:00.142 --> 18:02.678
happens everywhere lithosphere
is disrupted by mining.

18:02.711 --> 18:05.680
A natural reaction
to a natural invasive procedure.

18:05.714 --> 18:07.549
So the theory
is the American government

18:07.581 --> 18:10.718
decided to drill their own well
here at Shookum Hills.

18:10.752 --> 18:13.988
And now everyone is gone.

18:14.021 --> 18:15.990
The whole place is gone.

18:16.022 --> 18:18.392
Right, so, what you really need
to worry about

18:18.426 --> 18:20.694
is not whether this shit
is like quicksand,

18:20.726 --> 18:22.896
but rather that key members
of this expedition

18:22.928 --> 18:25.798
continue to discard fundamental
scientific principles

18:25.831 --> 18:27.766
and throw all reason
out the window.

18:27.799 --> 18:29.467
I am not discarding science.

18:29.501 --> 18:30.668
- Oh, no?
- I am just trying

18:30.702 --> 18:32.637
to embrace the notion

18:32.671 --> 18:33.972
that folklore, myth,
religion

18:34.005 --> 18:36.039
all stem from a merger
between science

18:36.073 --> 18:38.877
and, you know,
actual human experience.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.012
That idea might have grown
from a combination

18:41.045 --> 18:42.946
of myth and fact.

18:42.979 --> 18:45.047
- Yeah.
- Just like intelligent design

18:45.080 --> 18:48.184
is not a concept
that disregards the big bang.

18:48.218 --> 18:50.887
It just keeps us open
to the possibility

18:50.920 --> 18:52.522
that God created it.

18:52.555 --> 18:54.623
Except he didn't, Shawn.
A rapid disruption

18:54.656 --> 18:57.192
of the primordial singularity
did 15 billion years ago.

18:57.226 --> 18:59.461
- So you say.
- So science says.

18:59.494 --> 19:01.129
Christ, what is this?
Sophomore philosophy class?

19:01.161 --> 19:05.167
Christ.
Also, real guy, myth, both?

19:05.199 --> 19:08.669
- Mom and Dad are fighting again.
- They need counseling.

19:08.701 --> 19:10.203
I'm not having
this conversation.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.172
You seem to know what happened,
tell us.

19:12.206 --> 19:14.475
It's obvious,
an environmental disaster.

19:14.507 --> 19:15.908
And we're not here
to find hell.

19:15.941 --> 19:18.877
We're here
to find holes and smoke.

19:18.910 --> 19:20.746
Hmm. So basically hell, then.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.115
Thank you, guys, very much
for clearing that up.

19:23.148 --> 19:25.484
I'm sorry I asked.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.534
How long?

19:45.568 --> 19:46.703
I don't know.

19:48.837 --> 19:51.106
Did someone cut the wire?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.211
Not cut.

19:57.244 --> 19:58.712
It's torn.

20:01.715 --> 20:05.718
What? Like a fucking animal
chew on it or something?

20:05.751 --> 20:06.953
I don't think so.

20:06.987 --> 20:08.589
It's been pulled.

20:08.622 --> 20:09.989
Stripped from inside.

20:11.222 --> 20:12.924
At least the grating held.

20:12.958 --> 20:14.627
What's the voltage?

20:16.895 --> 20:19.196
Apparently not enough.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.864
<i>Cain,
they're trying to get out. Check your zone.</i>

20:56.896 --> 20:58.831
Yes, ma'am, I'm on it.

20:58.865 --> 21:00.567
Closing in on to 16 and 18,

21:00.599 --> 21:03.002
I'll check in when I'm done.
Over.

21:21.885 --> 21:24.954
I hear you, devil.

22:18.734 --> 22:19.869
That's my knife.

22:22.739 --> 22:23.906
Okay.

22:25.008 --> 22:26.808
Just don't like anyone else

22:26.842 --> 22:28.277
- touching it.
- I get it.

22:28.309 --> 22:30.913
I feel the same way
about my PlayStation.

22:32.881 --> 22:35.383
No, you don't.

22:35.415 --> 22:37.952
- Have a good night.
- Good night.

22:42.123 --> 22:44.123
Hey, hey.

22:44.157 --> 22:45.359
Hey.

22:47.661 --> 22:48.828
So, Darren.

22:48.862 --> 22:50.763
Yeah?

22:50.795 --> 22:53.833
Where did you find her?

22:55.668 --> 22:57.069
A colleague of mine,

22:57.102 --> 22:59.704
he did a dig with her
in Tanzania.

22:59.736 --> 23:02.673
Worst personality ever,
he said.

23:02.707 --> 23:05.709
Arrogant, self-absorbed.

23:05.743 --> 23:07.911
But she got him
where he needed to go.

23:07.944 --> 23:09.413
She worked in Africa, huh?

23:09.446 --> 23:11.180
Yeah, all over the
world, apparently.

23:11.214 --> 23:13.317
She likes to travel.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.083
Yep.

23:15.117 --> 23:18.021
Or she doesn't wanna
go home.

23:18.053 --> 23:19.254
Hmm.

23:31.732 --> 23:33.733
Did you tell him?

23:33.767 --> 23:35.169
I didn't need to.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.802
Any sign of those kids?

24:17.005 --> 24:19.073
Couldn't find them.

24:20.941 --> 24:22.710
But I scared them good.

24:23.844 --> 24:25.146
We're fine.

24:27.113 --> 24:30.316
I want them gone,
no matter what it takes.

24:30.350 --> 24:31.718
Are we clear?

24:50.234 --> 24:51.836
Can you fix this?

24:51.868 --> 24:53.404
I can patch it up.

24:53.436 --> 24:56.072
But I don't know
if it'd hold.

25:03.779 --> 25:06.815
Arianne. Hello?

25:06.847 --> 25:09.417
I just wanted to thank you.

25:11.153 --> 25:12.320
For what?

25:12.354 --> 25:15.123
Well, for getting us
this far.

25:15.155 --> 25:17.459
Pay me first,
thank me later.

25:18.959 --> 25:21.962
You know, I was thinking.

25:21.996 --> 25:24.898
We could use your help
in the mine,

25:24.930 --> 25:27.167
if you care to join.

25:27.199 --> 25:29.302
I'm not a scientist.

25:29.334 --> 25:32.270
My responsibility
is to get you there as agreed.

25:32.304 --> 25:34.406
Then I'm done.

25:34.438 --> 25:38.177
Okay, but what's next for you
after this?

25:38.209 --> 25:39.409
I've got another gig.

25:39.443 --> 25:40.979
What, more exciting
than being part

25:41.012 --> 25:43.782
of a groundbreaking
scientific discovery?

25:45.082 --> 25:46.351
I don't discuss
my clients with...

25:46.383 --> 25:49.119
Right, yes,
with other clients, right.

25:52.923 --> 25:54.191
Where did you scoop up

25:54.224 --> 25:57.225
that group
of super hombres out there?

25:57.259 --> 25:58.493
What's that?

25:58.526 --> 26:00.963
That group of men you have.

26:03.932 --> 26:06.101
Terry's an old acquaintance.

26:06.134 --> 26:07.335
He's not much of a talker.

26:08.602 --> 26:10.304
But he knows his tech
and can power up

26:10.338 --> 26:13.307
pretty much anything with
a stick and a piece of string.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.041
Shawn is...

26:15.075 --> 26:18.978
We share the same fascination
for this place, really.

26:19.010 --> 26:22.581
And as annoying as he is,
he's an expert geologist.

26:22.615 --> 26:25.418
He has my respect.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.554
Jaime's pretty new.
He joined us about a month ago.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.221
Security services.

26:31.489 --> 26:34.424
Why do you need
private security

26:34.458 --> 26:36.060
for a scientific expedition?

26:36.093 --> 26:37.995
Well, to keep us safe.

26:38.027 --> 26:39.897
Safe from what?

26:40.965 --> 26:42.100
Um...

26:43.166 --> 26:45.202
I like to be prepared.

26:47.437 --> 26:50.306
What are you expecting
to find here?

26:51.640 --> 26:53.909
Anthracite.

26:53.941 --> 26:55.143
Ultra high-grade.

26:55.177 --> 26:57.313
It burns like nothing else.

26:57.345 --> 26:59.581
If... If we can sample it,

26:59.613 --> 27:03.150
find out exactly
how it smolders and spreads,

27:03.184 --> 27:06.087
we might have a key
to understanding what causes

27:06.120 --> 27:10.624
these environmental disasters
and prevent future ones.

27:10.657 --> 27:14.627
And that's it? Nothing more?

27:14.659 --> 27:17.896
A thousand people lived
in Shookum Hills, Arianne.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.500
A thousand, all gone.

27:22.532 --> 27:24.001
Even with a great fire

27:24.034 --> 27:25.870
people don't just disappear
like that.

27:25.904 --> 27:28.472
Towns don't.

27:28.505 --> 27:31.441
Something else
happened here.

27:31.474 --> 27:33.343
Something more.

27:33.376 --> 27:35.879
And I'm here
to discover what that is,

27:35.913 --> 27:37.514
document it

27:37.547 --> 27:38.948
and bring it home.

27:38.980 --> 27:42.050
So the truth, I guess, is...

27:42.084 --> 27:43.553
what I'm hoping to find.

27:46.988 --> 27:51.360
I'm sorry.
It's just my vitamins.

27:56.095 --> 27:58.900
So, what... What do you think
we'll find here?

28:00.100 --> 28:02.602
Only what you take with you.

28:04.269 --> 28:06.639
Nietzsche, right?

28:08.140 --> 28:09.575
Yoda.

28:13.178 --> 28:14.479
Right.

28:16.948 --> 28:20.150
Well, have a good night.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.954
Good night.

29:08.526 --> 29:12.029
Darren. This is what,
like the fifth one of these?

29:12.063 --> 29:15.199
Yeah, it's probably
a warning system for gas leaks.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.067
Looks pretty new.

29:17.101 --> 29:18.268
Look at this.

29:19.370 --> 29:20.972
Studio foam.

29:21.005 --> 29:23.640
- What?
- Soundproofing.

29:23.672 --> 29:26.142
What is that doing here?

29:30.745 --> 29:32.081
Terry.

29:33.581 --> 29:36.151
Yeah, I see it.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.426
I smell sulfur. Be careful.

29:45.458 --> 29:48.461
Yeah, I'll take out
the CO2 readers.

29:51.196 --> 29:53.466
Check the BTUs.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.434
Someone's coming. Get down.

30:03.407 --> 30:05.977
Guys,
that's the car from yesterday.

30:09.347 --> 30:10.513
Let's keep moving.

30:10.547 --> 30:12.283
They know we're here.

30:44.709 --> 30:47.246
- Hey, Terry?
- Yeah.

30:48.714 --> 30:52.151
You can literally feel heat
from the fires.

31:07.396 --> 31:09.465
Guys!

31:09.499 --> 31:11.568
Come look at this!

31:37.723 --> 31:39.725
We found it.

32:10.552 --> 32:13.655
These buildings are
way older than I expected.

32:13.687 --> 32:15.357
It makes sense.

32:15.389 --> 32:17.825
This has been a mining town
since the early 1900s.

32:17.859 --> 32:21.262
- I'm gonna document this.
- Yeah.

32:23.696 --> 32:27.233
This looks
like some kind of shop.

32:50.353 --> 32:51.822
Oh, look at this.

32:54.691 --> 32:55.826
What's the air stat?

32:58.693 --> 33:01.763
Slightly elevated,
but that's to be expected.

33:01.796 --> 33:03.600
Nothing out of the green.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.502
But as the mines burn,

33:08.535 --> 33:12.207
they occasionally release
methane and carbon monoxide.

33:12.239 --> 33:15.575
And this air monitor detects
them before we do.

33:15.609 --> 33:17.845
Yeah,
we should probably get out of here.

33:17.878 --> 33:20.714
It's our canary
in the coal mine as it were.

33:20.746 --> 33:22.614
Now, as you can see,

33:22.648 --> 33:26.485
entire shops and houses
were abandoned outright.

33:28.286 --> 33:31.556
We've yet to determine
if the inhabitants left

33:31.590 --> 33:37.263
because of the gases,
the sinkholes or something else.

34:27.537 --> 34:29.840
So can I thank you now?

34:29.874 --> 34:31.509
You surely can.

34:56.431 --> 34:57.865
Shoot away, mate.

34:57.897 --> 35:01.535
- I wonder how far down this goes?
- Well, let's find out.

35:02.602 --> 35:04.704
Yeah, it's electrified.

35:04.738 --> 35:06.439
Well, can we power it off
or something?

35:06.471 --> 35:08.741
I don't know about powering off,
maybe bypass it.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.777
Like that?

35:10.809 --> 35:12.846
Yeah, something like that.
Get the scanner.

35:19.984 --> 35:21.419
You can't get any closer.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.887
He's fine.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.856
We should secure you both
with a line.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.392
This grate's unstable.
It's not safe.

35:27.425 --> 35:28.760
I can't authorize this.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.694
You're right. You can't.

35:30.727 --> 35:32.029
Go on.

35:39.901 --> 35:41.903
- Get the scanner.
- Yep. One second.

35:41.936 --> 35:43.972
Hey, Shawn. Can you give me
a hand with this?

35:44.005 --> 35:45.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:49.810 --> 35:50.978
Terry.

35:51.011 --> 35:53.013
- Yeah?
- What is that?

35:53.047 --> 35:55.082
Records image, sound,
measures air composition,

35:55.115 --> 35:57.751
then distills and separates
each individual component

35:57.783 --> 35:58.952
for subsequent analysis.

35:58.985 --> 36:00.620
It checks for anthracite.

36:00.653 --> 36:01.853
Got it.

36:01.886 --> 36:03.488
All right, here we go.

36:03.522 --> 36:05.391
Lower it, Shawn.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.735
Okay, what do you got?

36:18.768 --> 36:21.471
Nothing yet.

36:21.505 --> 36:22.773
All right.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.309
Lower it.

36:35.684 --> 36:37.420
I hit the bottom.

36:38.487 --> 36:39.655
Nothing?

36:39.688 --> 36:41.356
No.

36:41.389 --> 36:43.490
All right, here we go.

36:52.164 --> 36:53.499
Hey, Shawn.

36:58.669 --> 37:01.806
C15-H11-0.

37:01.839 --> 37:03.641
The composition
is extremely pure.

37:03.674 --> 37:06.510
I've never seen
anything like that.

37:06.543 --> 37:07.845
That's it, man.

37:07.878 --> 37:09.646
We've got it.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.383
I've found it.

37:12.617 --> 37:13.984
Shawn, bring up the scanner.

37:14.016 --> 37:17.154
Hey, hold on, one second.
Wait, wait, wait.

37:17.187 --> 37:18.755
There is something
down there.

37:23.691 --> 37:25.427
What the hell is that?

37:30.632 --> 37:31.800
Aah! Fuck!

37:31.833 --> 37:33.969
- What happened?
- Goddamn it!

37:34.002 --> 37:36.737
- What?
- It blew my ear drum out, man.

37:36.770 --> 37:38.839
Turn it up. Listen to this.

37:41.841 --> 37:42.977
Turn it up.

37:45.578 --> 37:46.913
Listen.

37:49.782 --> 37:51.451
Right there.

37:55.553 --> 37:56.689
What is that?

37:57.922 --> 38:00.658
- You hear it?
- Sort of.

38:07.231 --> 38:08.733
Terry!

38:08.766 --> 38:10.699
- Terry!
- Terry!

38:10.732 --> 38:12.067
Help!

38:12.100 --> 38:13.769
Help me!

38:13.803 --> 38:17.473
- Can you hear us?
- We have to get him.

38:17.506 --> 38:18.706
Terry!

38:18.740 --> 38:21.477
Oh, no! Oh, no!

38:21.510 --> 38:23.078
No! Help me!

38:23.110 --> 38:25.646
Help me!

38:28.748 --> 38:31.553
- What just happened?
- Jaime, get over here.

38:31.585 --> 38:33.554
- Jaime!
- We shouldn't have been here.

38:33.587 --> 38:34.754
We shouldn't be here.

38:34.787 --> 38:36.722
Shawn,
I need the gas detector.

38:36.756 --> 38:38.626
Shawn! The detector.

38:39.693 --> 38:40.828
Darren!

38:42.228 --> 38:43.863
We're going in after him, okay?

38:43.895 --> 38:45.564
Just keep close
and follow my lead.

38:45.598 --> 38:47.032
I got it.

38:57.608 --> 38:58.976
Let's go.

39:40.279 --> 39:41.746
Terry.

39:41.779 --> 39:43.015
Terry.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.550
Terry!

39:46.584 --> 39:48.620
Terry.

39:50.854 --> 39:52.490
Terry!

39:55.257 --> 39:56.826
Terry!

40:11.940 --> 40:13.909
Darren.

40:15.876 --> 40:17.112
Hey!

40:20.781 --> 40:21.916
I'll talk to him.

40:23.749 --> 40:25.984
We need your help.
You need to call for help.

40:26.018 --> 40:28.688
- What have you done?
- Our friends are down there.

40:28.721 --> 40:30.023
What have you done?

40:30.056 --> 40:31.590
Someone fell down the hole.

40:31.623 --> 40:33.758
- How long has this been open?
- Our friends...

40:33.792 --> 40:35.227
How long has this been open!

40:35.259 --> 40:38.029
Sir. It's fine. It's fine.

40:38.062 --> 40:40.097
Jaime, did you hear that?

40:42.967 --> 40:44.168
Jaime.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.637
Gas levels
are through the roof.

40:46.670 --> 40:48.204
We have to get out of here.

40:48.237 --> 40:51.640
I'm not leaving him
down here.

40:51.674 --> 40:55.545
If we don't save ourselves,
everyone dies.

40:58.947 --> 41:00.149
We have to go.

41:02.217 --> 41:04.686
- Someone fell down the hole.
- You've got a rope.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.088
- I'll cut it.
- No. No.

41:07.121 --> 41:09.123
- No.
- Back the fuck up.

41:09.156 --> 41:10.625
It's fine, sir.

41:10.658 --> 41:12.025
You can't do that.

41:12.058 --> 41:14.160
There's people down there.

41:14.193 --> 41:15.995
Arianne, quick!

41:16.028 --> 41:17.164
Jaime.

41:24.703 --> 41:26.771
What's going on?

41:26.804 --> 41:28.840
- Fuck.
- Let's go.

41:30.642 --> 41:31.777
Oh, fuck.

41:33.044 --> 41:34.812
- Is he dead?
- No, no.

41:34.845 --> 41:36.714
- Did I kill him?
- No, he's fine.

41:36.747 --> 41:37.949
He's fine, Shawn.

41:40.983 --> 41:42.119
He's fine.

41:50.825 --> 41:53.061
What happened? Who is this?

41:53.095 --> 41:55.998
He tried to cut the rope.

41:56.030 --> 41:57.798
Hey, hey.

41:57.831 --> 42:00.368
- Call an ambulance.
- How? Our cells are no good here

42:00.402 --> 42:02.268
and our satellite phone
was on Terry.

42:02.301 --> 42:04.204
Where is he?

42:04.237 --> 42:06.906
Where's Terry?
What happened to him?

42:06.940 --> 42:09.143
- We couldn't find him.
- Fuck! Fuck this!

42:09.176 --> 42:11.378
- We couldn't find him.
- What do you mean?

42:11.410 --> 42:12.845
He didn't run away.

42:12.878 --> 42:14.647
No, of course not.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.015
So? What happened to him?

42:16.048 --> 42:17.750
We don't know
what's down there.

42:17.783 --> 42:19.250
Gas levels were sky-high.

42:20.819 --> 42:23.154
We might be dealing
with something...

42:23.188 --> 42:24.757
Something else.

42:24.790 --> 42:26.957
- What was that thing?
- What thing?

42:26.990 --> 42:28.859
- You saw. We all saw.
- I don't know

42:28.892 --> 42:31.829
- what you're talking about.
- What do you mean?

42:31.861 --> 42:33.897
- We need to leave now!
- Just leave him here?

42:33.929 --> 42:36.299
The man came with a knife
and a shotgun.

42:36.331 --> 42:38.835
I'm not waiting to see
what he pulls next.

42:41.903 --> 42:43.705
Okay, we'll call for help

42:43.738 --> 42:45.307
as soon as we reach a spot
where we can.

42:45.339 --> 42:46.709
Now let's go. Please.

42:46.742 --> 42:49.278
Guys, he's right. Let's go.

42:49.310 --> 42:50.645
Come on, let's go.

43:05.791 --> 43:09.095
I should have never allowed you
to convince me to come here.

43:09.128 --> 43:11.297
You've been as obsessed
with this place as I have.

43:11.329 --> 43:13.832
- But given your track record.
- Fuck off, Shawn.

43:13.864 --> 43:16.701
Darren's received five warnings
for scientific misconduct

43:16.734 --> 43:19.171
from three universities,
two kicked him out.

43:19.203 --> 43:20.705
- What?
- Who do old thinkers expel

43:20.739 --> 43:22.273
- from their midst?
- Psychopaths.

43:22.305 --> 43:24.809
- Visionaries.
- Who is funding this again?

43:24.842 --> 43:26.943
It isn't Cambridge
Earth Science Department.

43:28.878 --> 43:30.013
Oh, shit.

43:33.315 --> 43:34.451
Fuck!

43:35.484 --> 43:37.219
Fuck! Fuck!

43:37.252 --> 43:38.954
Fuck!

43:41.256 --> 43:42.758
Fuck!

43:42.791 --> 43:44.158
This thing's not going anywhere.

43:44.191 --> 43:45.493
It'll be dark soon.

43:45.525 --> 43:47.194
We better reach the fence.
Let's go.

44:35.235 --> 44:36.938
Fuck.

44:46.346 --> 44:48.149
Oh, shit. Fuck.

44:52.985 --> 44:55.488
This is Dale. Come in.

44:57.055 --> 44:59.290
<i>Gotcha, what's up?</i>

44:59.324 --> 45:00.526
We have a breach.

45:00.558 --> 45:03.194
Repeat. We have a breach.

45:16.873 --> 45:18.175
What the fuck is going on?

45:18.208 --> 45:20.476
We triggered an alarm.

45:20.509 --> 45:23.178
Through that, then west.
We should be back on track.

45:23.211 --> 45:25.580
- Okay. There it is again.
- What? What is it?

45:27.015 --> 45:28.917
- Listen.
- What is that?

45:28.950 --> 45:30.085
There.

45:36.590 --> 45:40.227
Turn off the flashlights.
Give me the night vision.

45:40.259 --> 45:41.895
What is that?

45:41.928 --> 45:43.997
Don't know. Same thing I heard
in the tunnel.

45:44.029 --> 45:45.498
Where is it coming from?

45:45.530 --> 45:47.900
Follow the light on my bag.

46:46.351 --> 46:49.520
- Jaime. Stay close.
- What?

46:49.553 --> 46:51.990
I hear something, over there.

46:52.022 --> 46:54.459
Yeah, I hear it too.

46:56.192 --> 46:58.929
Look out!

46:58.961 --> 47:00.563
What the fuck was that?

47:06.402 --> 47:07.603
Shawn!

47:11.674 --> 47:14.575
Go. Go, move. Go!

47:14.608 --> 47:15.976
Shit!

47:16.010 --> 47:17.679
Everybody run.

47:17.711 --> 47:19.213
Run!

47:19.247 --> 47:21.649
Go, go, go!

47:31.490 --> 47:33.927
Hey! Guys, a truck!
Let's go, now!

47:33.959 --> 47:35.227
Hey!

47:36.294 --> 47:37.462
Help us!

47:37.494 --> 47:39.464
Hey, over here!

47:41.967 --> 47:43.335
Get in the truck.

47:43.368 --> 47:45.269
Now, quick!

47:50.541 --> 47:52.577
Go, go, go!

49:03.704 --> 49:05.505
Out of my way.

49:05.538 --> 49:06.674
Move.

49:07.741 --> 49:09.377
Wait here and keep quiet.

49:18.383 --> 49:20.252
Where's Dale?

49:20.285 --> 49:24.123
- I'm getting nothing.
- Get him on the radio.

49:24.155 --> 49:26.192
Keep trying.

49:37.599 --> 49:38.735
I knew it.

49:40.503 --> 49:43.140
I knew you son of a bitches
were gonna cause trouble.

49:44.673 --> 49:46.741
Who are you?

49:46.774 --> 49:48.377
What are you doing here?

49:50.145 --> 49:52.547
My name is Darren Atkins,

49:52.580 --> 49:54.181
Professor of Geology

49:54.215 --> 49:57.084
at the Department
of Earth Sciences, Cambridge.

49:57.117 --> 49:59.486
We're here
on purely academic purposes

49:59.519 --> 50:02.489
to perform a series
of geological survey tests.

50:04.591 --> 50:06.293
How did you find us?

50:06.326 --> 50:10.062
Your guys
basically led us straight here.

50:10.095 --> 50:12.697
We had a general sense
of the area.

50:12.731 --> 50:15.234
You had a general sense
of the area?

50:15.267 --> 50:16.569
Yes.

50:16.602 --> 50:19.070
What does that mean?
A general sense of the area.

50:23.674 --> 50:25.242
What did you just say?

50:25.274 --> 50:26.543
How did you find us?

50:28.178 --> 50:30.548
My father used
to track down people for money,

50:30.580 --> 50:32.182
and I knew I had to look

50:32.216 --> 50:35.552
for where someone
made an effort to hide a trail.

50:36.619 --> 50:38.387
Where's your father now?

50:40.355 --> 50:41.656
He lost his way.

50:44.125 --> 50:46.394
Well, we've all lost something,
haven't we?

50:48.263 --> 50:50.632
Schuttmann.
I can't reach Dale or Cain.

50:52.833 --> 50:54.769
It could be out of range.

50:56.836 --> 50:58.538
You're Paul Schuttmann?

50:58.571 --> 51:02.342
Co-founder of Shookum Hills
mining company?

51:03.843 --> 51:05.577
I used to be.

51:05.610 --> 51:09.748
Now I do what you might call
security and protection work.

51:11.215 --> 51:13.383
What is it you protect?

51:13.417 --> 51:14.685
You.

51:14.719 --> 51:16.855
What happened here?
What is this place?

51:16.888 --> 51:18.656
A fucking hellhole.
That's what it is.

51:18.688 --> 51:21.791
Everybody here has their
own beliefs about what this is.

51:21.825 --> 51:23.527
What's yours?

51:24.794 --> 51:26.464
Maybe it's purgatory.

51:28.198 --> 51:30.299
The place where we go
to confront our sins,

51:30.331 --> 51:32.467
where we're tested
on our flaws.

51:32.500 --> 51:37.738
And you either come clean
or get destroyed.

51:37.772 --> 51:39.841
My sin was greed.

51:39.874 --> 51:41.343
What's yours?

51:42.544 --> 51:45.412
<i>Shelby, you there?</i>

51:45.445 --> 51:46.881
I'm here.

51:46.913 --> 51:48.882
<i>I got a couple of them,
scattered the rest.</i>

51:48.916 --> 51:50.885
<i>There's a lot of them.
We've got a breach somewhere.</i>

51:50.918 --> 51:52.486
<i>I don't know.</i>

51:52.518 --> 51:54.586
Find the breach.
I'll see what I can do here

51:54.620 --> 51:55.788
and get back to you.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.757
You opened a sinkhole?

51:57.790 --> 51:59.225
- I suppose we...
- Which one!

51:59.258 --> 52:00.393
I'll show you.

52:01.760 --> 52:05.531
Look,
we lost a man down there.

52:05.563 --> 52:07.632
Another one in the field.

52:09.567 --> 52:11.435
Go with them. Find it.

52:11.468 --> 52:14.337
- Seal it before it's too late.
- Let's go.

52:14.370 --> 52:16.508
Move, asshole.

52:17.673 --> 52:19.342
Professor.

52:29.618 --> 52:31.719
- What are those?
- Keep up.

52:31.752 --> 52:33.420
Why is this area
unprotected?

52:33.454 --> 52:34.689
It's not.

52:34.722 --> 52:36.758
We protect it.
We protect everybody.

52:36.791 --> 52:38.959
Before y'all showed up,
we were doing a fine...

52:41.527 --> 52:43.230
Nobody move.

52:43.263 --> 52:44.965
They sounded us.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.600
Hide.

52:52.905 --> 52:55.608
Ellroy,
do you see anything out there?

52:57.442 --> 52:59.476
<i>Shelby, you copy?</i>

52:59.509 --> 53:00.744
Keep it down. What's up?

53:00.777 --> 53:02.580
<i>Stay in the safe house.</i>

53:04.616 --> 53:06.216
<i>Whatever you do,
don't come out.</i>

53:07.618 --> 53:09.753
It's kind of too late
for that, Kip.

53:09.785 --> 53:12.455
<i>We made it to Safe House 4,
barely.</i>

53:12.488 --> 53:13.623
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

53:14.757 --> 53:16.793
How many?

53:16.826 --> 53:19.963
<i>It's hard to say.
Never seen anything like it.</i>

53:19.996 --> 53:21.630
Fuck.

53:21.663 --> 53:23.565
<i>You've gotta get back inside,
Shel.</i>

53:23.598 --> 53:26.602
There's a house on the hill.
Do you think we can make it?

53:26.634 --> 53:29.536
We don't know how many are out
there. We need to stay put.

53:31.271 --> 53:33.807
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I can't run fast enough,

53:33.840 --> 53:35.442
but I can slow them down.

53:35.476 --> 53:39.478
- What?
- Find the breach and close it.

53:39.511 --> 53:40.779
So give me this.

53:40.812 --> 53:42.215
And the lighter.

53:44.650 --> 53:48.954
Tell Dolores I didn't mess up
my good coat. All right?

53:48.986 --> 53:51.756
Now, y'all
get the fuck out of here.

53:51.789 --> 53:53.524
Go on, get.

53:54.991 --> 53:58.529
Here I am, come get me!

53:59.996 --> 54:02.465
Hey, you bastards!

54:03.566 --> 54:05.301
Shit.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.743
In there!

54:30.657 --> 54:32.759
This is not good.

54:49.473 --> 54:51.276
This isn't good.

55:13.861 --> 55:15.330
There's one outside.

55:15.363 --> 55:17.799
You have a rifle.

55:17.832 --> 55:20.435
If anything comes in here,
you use it.

55:20.468 --> 55:23.036
They are attracted to noise.

55:48.392 --> 55:50.493
I don't see it anymore.

55:50.526 --> 55:52.861
- <i>Shelby, your status?</i>
- Shit. Shit.

56:01.703 --> 56:03.806
What is it doing?

56:05.473 --> 56:07.375
Calling the others.

56:08.642 --> 56:10.111
Listen carefully now.

56:12.912 --> 56:15.615
No matter what you do,
don't let them grab you.

56:18.116 --> 56:20.386
Because if they grab you,
they paralyze you

56:20.420 --> 56:22.456
and they take you
down there.

56:24.457 --> 56:26.959
God only knows what they
do to you when they've got you.

56:28.626 --> 56:29.794
Go.

56:39.670 --> 56:41.071
Okay.

56:46.709 --> 56:47.944
Fuck!

56:47.977 --> 56:49.112
Back up!

56:57.151 --> 56:59.087
- I'm okay!
- There's an exit!

56:59.120 --> 57:01.390
- Let's go!
- Come on! Go!

57:02.490 --> 57:03.658
Keep moving.

57:03.691 --> 57:05.458
There's a way through.

57:09.128 --> 57:11.464
Hurry up, they're coming.

57:58.204 --> 58:00.140
- This way.
- Wait.

58:00.173 --> 58:01.574
Take these.

58:01.607 --> 58:04.109
I'm gonna create
a diversion.

58:04.143 --> 58:06.813
- I'll join you again later.
- But we need you.

58:06.846 --> 58:08.981
Have a little faith.

58:09.013 --> 58:10.649
What?

58:13.718 --> 58:16.121
Go.

58:19.289 --> 58:21.925
Come and get me,
you assholes!

58:45.812 --> 58:47.681
- It's a dead end.
- In here.

58:47.714 --> 58:50.116
- Come on.
- Yeah, right. Go.

58:52.184 --> 58:55.088
Let's put up that grating.
It'll slow them down.

58:58.190 --> 59:00.627
We gotta get it from outside.

59:03.828 --> 59:07.164
Go. Go, hurry up.

59:09.066 --> 59:11.870
Oh, shit. The grenade!
Give me the grenade!

59:22.211 --> 59:23.814
- Jaime!
- Get down!

59:46.699 --> 59:48.601
Darren.

59:51.771 --> 59:53.540
Darren.

1:00:53.691 --> 1:00:56.627
Wait. Wait.

1:00:59.730 --> 1:01:00.998
We've lost them.

1:01:02.666 --> 1:01:04.701
We've lost them.

1:01:07.870 --> 1:01:11.707
Get up. We have to keep going.

1:01:11.741 --> 1:01:13.709
They're all gone.

1:01:13.742 --> 1:01:15.945
We don't know that.

1:01:15.978 --> 1:01:18.780
What if
it doesn't kill them?

1:01:18.813 --> 1:01:21.081
Just takes them away,

1:01:21.114 --> 1:01:23.685
keeps them alive
somewhere down there?

1:01:23.717 --> 1:01:25.654
What if...?

1:01:26.888 --> 1:01:28.354
Darren.

1:01:28.387 --> 1:01:30.090
Darren.

1:01:33.727 --> 1:01:35.329
I should have
never brought you.

1:01:36.895 --> 1:01:38.998
I'm the one
who brought us here.

1:01:40.366 --> 1:01:43.902
You know, Shawn was right.

1:01:45.704 --> 1:01:48.240
We weren't financed
by the university.

1:01:49.740 --> 1:01:52.776
I was backed
by a private mining company

1:01:52.810 --> 1:01:55.846
who wanted this coal.

1:01:55.878 --> 1:01:57.882
They offered me recognition

1:01:59.049 --> 1:02:01.685
and a great deal of money.

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.953
That's why we're all here.

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:07.256
That's why they're all gone.

1:02:10.726 --> 1:02:12.795
It's my fault.

1:02:13.862 --> 1:02:16.830
It's my fault.

1:02:16.863 --> 1:02:18.832
I guess you were right.

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:22.870
About what we'd find here.

1:02:26.139 --> 1:02:27.307
Truth.

1:02:46.389 --> 1:02:52.061
My last tour with a repeat team
was a climb in the Himalayas.

1:02:52.094 --> 1:02:55.031
One of them,
experienced climber,

1:02:55.065 --> 1:02:57.266
fell off a cliff.

1:02:57.298 --> 1:03:00.335
It was just the two of us
that day.

1:03:00.369 --> 1:03:06.174
I had him,
but I couldn't get him up.

1:03:06.206 --> 1:03:10.011
We waited for hours,
but no one came.

1:03:10.043 --> 1:03:12.114
We would have both frozen
to death.

1:03:12.146 --> 1:03:15.482
So in the end,

1:03:16.816 --> 1:03:19.252
I cut the rope.

1:03:19.285 --> 1:03:22.254
That's what you do
in situations like that.

1:03:24.190 --> 1:03:27.961
But I won't leave you behind.
You have to come with me.

1:03:30.562 --> 1:03:32.998
What's the fucking point?

1:03:43.974 --> 1:03:45.476
I'm gonna get help.

1:03:46.810 --> 1:03:48.245
Take this.

1:03:49.411 --> 1:03:51.413
You'll be fine.

1:03:51.446 --> 1:03:53.782
Stay here.

1:03:53.816 --> 1:03:56.419
I will come back for you.

1:09:46.156 --> 1:09:49.726
You're alive, thank God.

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:52.462
I tried to find you.

1:09:53.762 --> 1:09:56.100
The grenade.

1:09:56.132 --> 1:09:59.369
Can you grab it?
I can't move.

1:10:44.741 --> 1:10:45.876
What is that?

1:10:49.411 --> 1:10:52.581
An alternative species.

1:10:52.615 --> 1:10:53.750
Shawn.

1:10:54.851 --> 1:10:56.385
It's real.

1:11:04.192 --> 1:11:06.560
They breed and colonize.

1:11:07.694 --> 1:11:10.498
Like ants and bees.

1:11:11.565 --> 1:11:13.567
If only the world could see.

1:11:13.599 --> 1:11:15.835
If only... No.

1:11:23.509 --> 1:11:24.710
Shawn.

1:11:44.693 --> 1:11:49.331
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hollowed be thy...

1:11:55.737 --> 1:11:57.773
Our Father...

1:12:00.773 --> 1:12:02.509
The grenade.

1:12:08.614 --> 1:12:12.218
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1:12:12.252 --> 1:12:14.354
Thy kingdom come...

1:14:11.022 --> 1:14:13.558
We gotta get out of here.
Put this on.

1:14:14.591 --> 1:14:15.793
They're coming.

1:14:41.782 --> 1:14:45.552
They're coming.
Climb. Climb.

1:14:56.026 --> 1:14:58.364
Hurry! Darren. Hurry!

1:15:13.976 --> 1:15:15.945
- No! No! Aah!
- Aah! No!

1:15:15.979 --> 1:15:18.548
No! No!

1:15:21.916 --> 1:15:23.718
Here, take my knife.

1:15:23.751 --> 1:15:25.420
Kill it.

1:15:46.704 --> 1:15:49.708
It's what you do, right?

1:15:49.742 --> 1:15:51.476
In situations like this.

1:15:52.743 --> 1:15:55.080
Wait. Don't!

1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:36.550
Help me. Get me out of here.

1:16:36.582 --> 1:16:38.451
Help me. Help me.

1:16:38.484 --> 1:16:40.553
I'm sorry. I can't.

1:16:40.585 --> 1:16:42.588
Please. They're coming.

1:16:42.620 --> 1:16:43.989
Please!

1:16:48.825 --> 1:16:50.561
I can't.
No man is more important...

1:16:50.594 --> 1:16:52.030
Get her out of here.

1:16:53.798 --> 1:16:55.499
Come on. I got you.

1:16:58.702 --> 1:16:59.837
Hurry.

1:17:06.242 --> 1:17:07.777
I got you. Come on.

1:17:07.809 --> 1:17:10.045
Take my hand.
I got you. Here we go.

1:17:20.152 --> 1:17:21.789
Go!

1:17:44.774 --> 1:17:47.678
Hey. Are you all right?

1:17:47.711 --> 1:17:49.780
- Here.
- Yeah.

1:17:49.813 --> 1:17:51.680
What happened to your group?

1:17:51.714 --> 1:17:52.883
I'm the only one left.

1:17:52.915 --> 1:17:54.817
Are you sure?

1:17:54.851 --> 1:17:56.519
Yeah.

1:18:01.690 --> 1:18:03.960
Let's get you out of here.

1:18:46.730 --> 1:18:48.932
They took my son.

1:18:51.833 --> 1:18:53.936
And I've been fighting them
ever since.

1:18:56.938 --> 1:18:59.074
All we've managed to do so far
is contain them.

1:18:59.107 --> 1:19:01.009
You can imagine
what would happen

1:19:01.041 --> 1:19:02.911
if they made it
over that fence.

1:19:04.111 --> 1:19:06.981
Like you can contain them.

1:19:07.013 --> 1:19:09.717
People need to know
about this.

1:19:11.117 --> 1:19:13.852
People
wouldn't even believe this.

1:19:13.886 --> 1:19:16.923
People aren't ready
to know about this.

1:19:18.057 --> 1:19:19.858
We've tried to protect him.

1:19:19.891 --> 1:19:23.095
We've been working really hard
to keep it a secret.

1:19:23.127 --> 1:19:26.097
But you have
to tell someone.

1:19:27.732 --> 1:19:29.000
You've been searching
for the truth.

1:19:29.032 --> 1:19:32.669
What do you do
when you find the truth?

1:19:32.702 --> 1:19:35.305
Do you go
and you tell the people?

1:19:37.006 --> 1:19:40.777
Or do you stay here
and fight this thing with us?

1:19:43.946 --> 1:19:46.049
- Me?
- You're a survivor.

1:19:47.715 --> 1:19:49.718
What do you survive for?

1:19:50.953 --> 1:19:54.256
You can't possibly...

1:19:55.823 --> 1:19:59.827
rationally believe
you can win this?

1:19:59.859 --> 1:20:02.128
I believe we can.

1:20:09.268 --> 1:20:11.671
I have to go back.

1:20:28.451 --> 1:20:30.221
Arianne.

1:20:31.453 --> 1:20:33.055
Good luck.

1:21:25.835 --> 1:21:28.003
We're gonna need this.

1:21:37.344 --> 1:21:38.946
Yeah.
