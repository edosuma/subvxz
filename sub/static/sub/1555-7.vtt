WEBVTT

00:01.851 --> 00:04.586
We are being watched.

00:04.588 --> 00:06.588
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.590 --> 00:11.193
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.195 --> 00:13.529
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.531 --> 00:15.364
but it sees everything...

00:15.366 --> 00:18.233
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.235 --> 00:21.403
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.405 --> 00:23.438
We don't.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.576
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:27.578 --> 00:29.410
You will never find us.

00:29.412 --> 00:31.412
But victim or perpetrator,

00:31.414 --> 00:35.498
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:35.499 --> 00:38.672

00:43.424 --> 00:45.992
Come on, any second, guys.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.062
Not a good time, Harold.

00:49.064 --> 00:51.698
It never is these days,
Ms. Shaw.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.499
It's not as if
Professor Whistler

00:53.501 --> 00:56.202
doesn't have a stack
of abysmal midterms to grade.

00:56.204 --> 00:59.672
My situation is slightly
more time sensitive.

01:01.109 --> 01:02.208
And yet numbers keep coming.

01:02.210 --> 01:03.509
<i>Amateurs.</i>

01:03.511 --> 01:06.044
Our newest irrelevant
is named--

01:07.181 --> 01:09.848
Ms. Shaw,
is that gunfire?

01:09.850 --> 01:11.517
Well, I told you I was busy.

01:11.519 --> 01:13.385
Now I'm gonna need you
to call up that shadow map

01:13.387 --> 01:16.222
and access the NYPD
dispatch feeds.

01:16.224 --> 01:17.523
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go!

01:22.629 --> 01:25.130
<i>All units, pursuit
in progress, black Sedan.</i>

01:25.132 --> 01:27.099
<i>Lost them. Last
seen on westbound 116.</i>

01:27.101 --> 01:31.103
<i>Dispatch, 10-48.
No sign of them here.</i>

01:32.471 --> 01:33.972
Whoo!

01:35.375 --> 01:37.875
Nice.

01:37.877 --> 01:40.711
Yo, hottie.

01:50.056 --> 01:52.423
We had a deal, remember?

01:52.425 --> 01:55.660
You get out in time or I walk.

01:55.662 --> 01:57.461
<i>So now this happens.</i>

02:04.770 --> 02:06.270
Oh, God.

02:06.272 --> 02:08.139
Sorry, Romeo.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.674
Think we just broke up.

02:18.516 --> 02:22.819
NYPD just found your
getaway car by the East River.

02:22.821 --> 02:24.621
Hope they can't
trace it back to you.

02:24.623 --> 02:27.523
Be a shame if I had
to slap the cuffs on.

02:27.525 --> 02:30.626
Well, it's be a shame for you
if you tried.

02:30.628 --> 02:33.362
Now who's our boy?

02:33.364 --> 02:35.498
Tomas Koroa.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.200
Dual US, Spanish citizen.

02:37.202 --> 02:40.269
<i>31 years old, unmarried.</i>

02:40.271 --> 02:42.971
<i>Spends part of each year here</i>

02:42.973 --> 02:45.841
on a B1 visa.

02:45.843 --> 02:47.176
Doing what?

02:47.178 --> 02:48.811
<i>International wine dealer.</i>

02:48.813 --> 02:51.214
Divides his time between
New York, London,

02:51.216 --> 02:52.781
Paris, and Dubai.

02:52.783 --> 02:55.218
Now fair warning,
this St. Emillion

02:55.220 --> 02:57.687
is gonna make you both
wanna quit your jobs

02:57.689 --> 02:59.688
<i>and run way to Bordeaux.</i>

02:59.690 --> 03:01.289
A lot of travel,

03:01.291 --> 03:03.291
importing foreign goods.

03:03.293 --> 03:05.327
Maybe he's wrapped up
in smuggling.

03:05.329 --> 03:07.495
<i>That's possible, but</i>
<i>I didn't see anything fishy</i>

03:07.497 --> 03:09.464
when I bluejacked his phone.

03:09.466 --> 03:11.399
Well, then maybe business
isn't his problem.

03:11.401 --> 03:14.369
A guy like that could have
a girl in every port.

03:14.371 --> 03:17.739
Maybe infidelity is about
to spank him on the ass.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.745
I'm just trying to identify
the threat, John.

03:23.747 --> 03:26.348
You just go play detective.

03:26.350 --> 03:28.350
I can keep an eye on Tomas.

03:28.352 --> 03:29.884
I noticed.

03:29.886 --> 03:32.153
All right, well,
what about Finch?

03:32.155 --> 03:36.057
Shouldn't he be digging up
Tomas' digital footprint?

03:36.059 --> 03:39.593
He will, but he had other
business to attend to first.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.595
We're all two people now,
remember?

03:49.571 --> 03:51.004
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

03:55.042 --> 03:57.043
If you play
nice on the playground,

03:57.045 --> 03:59.780
then after you will have
the ice creams, yes?

03:59.782 --> 04:01.348
- Yes.
- Okay.

04:05.220 --> 04:08.521
Lovely children.
Not yours, I hope.

04:08.523 --> 04:10.090
Relax, Harold.

04:10.092 --> 04:12.926
I'm just the nanny.

04:12.928 --> 04:16.728
My sixth new identity
in two weeks.

04:16.731 --> 04:19.399
A necessary precaution,
I imagine,

04:19.401 --> 04:21.767
after your close call
with Samaritan's operatives

04:21.769 --> 04:23.068
during the election.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.738
Necessary but exhausting.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.373
French Mary Poppins Barbie

04:27.375 --> 04:29.609
is the only me
that's been any fun.

04:29.611 --> 04:31.411
Though I'm not sure
how the parents would feel

04:31.413 --> 04:35.214
if they knew how many people
I've killed.

04:35.216 --> 04:37.717
So why are we here?

04:37.719 --> 04:40.085
The machine just told me
to come to this playground

04:40.087 --> 04:41.887
and follow your plan.

04:41.889 --> 04:45.590
Then let's hope
it's a good one.

04:45.592 --> 04:48.460
<i>Nicholas Dawson.</i>

04:48.462 --> 04:51.297
Samaritan's undemocratically
elected choice for Governor.

04:51.299 --> 04:53.332
Are we bringing him down?

04:53.334 --> 04:56.234
Unfortunately,
now that Samaritan

04:56.236 --> 04:58.303
has sent Mr. Greer
to make contact,

04:58.305 --> 05:01.640
we can't risk going anywhere
near our new Governor.

05:01.642 --> 05:04.075
But we can work to undermine

05:04.077 --> 05:07.078
every single thing
he tries to do.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.748
And one of Dawson's
first acts as Governor

05:09.750 --> 05:12.616
was to approve
a $12 million grant

05:12.618 --> 05:14.085
for that man,

05:14.087 --> 05:16.587
Jerrod Wilkins,
software engineer,

05:16.589 --> 05:18.089
41 years old,

05:18.091 --> 05:19.090
recently divorced.

05:19.092 --> 05:20.491
Two weeks ago,

05:20.493 --> 05:22.593
Wilkins left a lucrative job
in the tech sector

05:22.595 --> 05:25.930
to found a new charity
called OTPS.

05:25.932 --> 05:27.131
Which stands for?

05:27.133 --> 05:28.766
No one seems to know.

05:28.768 --> 05:32.102
OTPS has no office, no website.

05:32.104 --> 05:33.871
We need to find out what
he plans to do with that money

05:33.873 --> 05:35.305
and put a stop to it.

05:35.307 --> 05:38.776
Daddy, I made a boom-boom.

05:38.778 --> 05:41.278
Okay, um...

05:41.280 --> 05:43.180
Okay, just go ahead and--

05:43.182 --> 05:44.781
Wait, hold on, hold on.

05:44.783 --> 05:46.783
Hold on, just--
Don't sit.

05:46.785 --> 05:49.119
Um... Oh.

05:49.121 --> 05:51.955
And now I know why I'm a nanny.

05:51.957 --> 05:55.192
<i>Au revoir, mon cher.</i>

05:57.528 --> 05:59.462
Ooh.

05:59.464 --> 06:01.664
Excuse me.

06:01.666 --> 06:04.967
It seems to me as if you
might need some assistance.

06:04.969 --> 06:06.135
Yes?

06:11.975 --> 06:13.710
Okay, so that's
six cases of albariÃ±o,

06:13.712 --> 06:15.978
12 of the neuf-du-pape,
and next time I'm in Reims,

06:15.980 --> 06:17.846
I'm sending you a box
of those chocolates.

06:17.848 --> 06:19.815
<i>And how is Mr. Koroa
faring, Ms. Shaw?</i>

06:19.817 --> 06:21.384
Any sign of the threat?

06:21.386 --> 06:25.321
In four hours,
Tomas has barely gone 900 feet.

06:25.323 --> 06:28.490
He just keeps moving from
one restaurant to the next,

06:28.492 --> 06:30.993
blabbing about wine.

06:30.995 --> 06:32.594
<i>The only thing keeping me awake</i>

06:32.596 --> 06:34.563
<i>is his...</i>

06:34.565 --> 06:36.765
personality.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.667
Indeed.

06:38.669 --> 06:40.536
<i>Hang on a sec.</i>

06:40.538 --> 06:42.538
That's the girl who checked
<i>him out this morning.</i>

06:42.540 --> 06:44.840
Tomas may have a tail.

06:44.842 --> 06:47.175
<i>Same workmen</i>
<i>from this morning too.</i>

06:47.177 --> 06:48.710
That's not a tail.

06:48.712 --> 06:51.046
We're looking at some kind
of a hit squad.

06:54.016 --> 06:57.885
On second thought,

06:57.887 --> 06:59.754
this may not be that kinda hit.

07:09.198 --> 07:10.230
Ten seconds.

07:10.232 --> 07:14.401
Nine, eight, seven, six,

07:14.403 --> 07:18.172
five, four, three,

07:18.174 --> 07:20.107
<i>two, one.</i>

07:20.109 --> 07:21.509
Looks like
we're not the only ones

07:21.511 --> 07:22.877
leading double lives, Finch.

07:26.281 --> 07:29.049
Tomas isn't a wine dealer.
<i>He's a thief.</i>

07:29.051 --> 07:31.585
And a damn good one.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.519
<i>In and out in
under ten seconds.</i>

07:48.521 --> 07:50.020
A perfect smash-and-grab.

07:50.022 --> 07:52.889
Our boy Tomas really knows
what he's doing.

07:52.891 --> 07:56.793
Perhaps you could try not
to sound quite so enthused.

07:56.795 --> 07:58.562
Crime is my day job.

07:58.564 --> 08:00.897
I'm-- I'm just admiring
his technique.

08:00.899 --> 08:02.699
Domain awareness
caught the robbery,

08:02.701 --> 08:05.869
but not camera saw Tomas and
his crew getting into the car,

08:05.871 --> 08:07.771
which was reported stolen
two days ago.

08:07.773 --> 08:09.906
So the cops haven't
ID'd him yet?

08:09.908 --> 08:11.975
I'm fairly certain
that the NYPD

08:11.977 --> 08:13.910
isn't the only agency
trying to find them.

08:13.912 --> 08:15.812
Their modus operandi
matches that

08:15.814 --> 08:18.448
of a highly successful
team of thieves

08:18.450 --> 08:21.918
that the Interpol has dubbed
"The Hole In The Wall" gang

08:21.920 --> 08:24.387
for obvious reasons.

08:24.389 --> 08:26.222
In the past seven years,

08:26.224 --> 08:28.424
<i>Tomas and his team</i>
<i>have hit over 50</i>

08:28.426 --> 08:31.294
<i>high value targets</i>
<i>on four continents.</i>

08:31.296 --> 08:34.830
Mmm, so Tomas
is a real bad boy.

08:34.832 --> 08:39.668
Which means that he is
probably our perpetrator.

08:39.669 --> 08:42.004
Guy like this
might be willing to kill

08:42.006 --> 08:44.006
to take down his next score.

08:44.008 --> 08:45.407
Or our target might be someone

08:45.409 --> 08:47.910
who already knows
Tomas' secrets.

08:47.912 --> 08:51.413
Marko Jevtic was
the only member of Tomas' crew

08:51.415 --> 08:53.015
to ever get caught.

08:53.017 --> 08:55.783
Picked up by the police
after a robbery in Prague.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.285
Ten hours later,
he died in custody

08:57.287 --> 08:59.687
under suspicious circumstances.

08:59.689 --> 09:03.291
So maybe Tomas isn't above
bumping off one of his own.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.293
Well, they're not
the most trustworthy bunch.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.595
Max Dahlgren

09:07.597 --> 09:10.165
and Henrik Lengfelder,

09:10.167 --> 09:13.935
both had well-documented
issues with authority.

09:13.937 --> 09:17.005
And Katya Rodchenko has
a long history of drug abuse.

09:17.007 --> 09:18.840
It appears that we have
inadvertently captured

09:18.842 --> 09:21.142
a group of notorious criminals.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.278
Should we turn them over
to Interpol and call it a day?

09:24.280 --> 09:26.047
We're here
to stop violence, okay?

09:26.049 --> 09:28.182
Not recover stolen jewels.

09:28.184 --> 09:30.451
If we move before we know
what Tomas is up to,

09:30.453 --> 09:31.952
then this whole thing
could go sideways,

09:31.954 --> 09:33.354
and we'll miss our chance
to stop it.

09:33.356 --> 09:35.189
Plus you won't get
to look at him anymore.

09:35.191 --> 09:37.391
Are you trying
to make me kill you?

09:37.393 --> 09:38.859
Let's try to stay focused
on the murder

09:38.861 --> 09:41.128
that Mr. Koroa
is poised to commit.

09:41.130 --> 09:42.996
To uncover his plans,

09:42.998 --> 09:44.698
we would need to have
a man on the inside.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.333
Or in this case, a woman.

09:58.512 --> 10:01.081
I have reservation
for penthouse suite.

10:02.717 --> 10:04.250
Oh, easy, Bear?

10:04.252 --> 10:05.918
He's trained to smell drugs.

10:07.489 --> 10:08.854
Sit, stall, <i>stil.</i>

10:11.393 --> 10:13.159
Yeah, NYPD, ma'am.

10:13.161 --> 10:15.095
I need to take a look
at your bag.

10:15.097 --> 10:18.030
Enjoy yourself.
I have nothing to hide.

10:22.836 --> 10:24.403
You sure about that?

10:37.350 --> 10:39.251
Told me she wasn't
using anymore.

10:39.253 --> 10:40.519
<i>Now we have a problem.</i>

10:40.521 --> 10:42.187
Guess what, Shaw.

10:42.189 --> 10:46.225
Tomas has a problem,
and you're the solution.

10:46.227 --> 10:47.593
<i>I'll reach out
to my criminal contacts</i>

10:47.595 --> 10:50.195
<i>and set up a meeting.</i>

10:50.197 --> 10:52.430
<i>No, no, no, there
is nothing to worry about.</i>

10:52.432 --> 10:54.565
<i>We are going</i>
<i>to make this happen.</i>

10:54.567 --> 10:57.368
Trust me, this will be
nothing short of a revolution.

10:57.370 --> 10:59.437
With the Governor
and his people on board...

10:59.439 --> 11:02.440
I'm in, I've got him on
the A/V monitor, and you

11:02.442 --> 11:05.710
should have a signal now,
Harold.

11:05.712 --> 11:07.878
I take it you had no trouble
ingratiating yourself

11:07.880 --> 11:09.980
with Mr. Wilkins
and his son.

11:09.982 --> 11:12.216
Oh, Sebastian's an angel.

11:12.218 --> 11:14.152
Just a little free spirit

11:14.154 --> 11:17.255
who needs his
creativity nurtured.

11:17.257 --> 11:20.625
His dad, on the other hand,
is a little more type-A.

11:20.627 --> 11:23.127
When OTPS
starts generating results,

11:23.129 --> 11:24.728
<i>you're gonna want</i>
<i>to be on board.</i>

11:24.730 --> 11:26.563
Any luck finding out
what his fraudulent charity

11:26.565 --> 11:27.798
is really up to?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.232
Patience, Harold.

11:29.234 --> 11:31.301
Or I'll have to give you
a time-out.

11:32.671 --> 11:33.671
_

11:33.672 --> 11:36.439
We are ready to go right now.

11:36.441 --> 11:38.008
Okay, we're in.

11:38.010 --> 11:40.777
It'll take me
just a minute to locate--

11:40.779 --> 11:42.245
<i>Oh, my.</i> _

11:42.247 --> 11:44.681
It turns out
that Mr. Wilkins' charity

11:44.683 --> 11:47.417
may not be so fraudulent
after all.

11:47.419 --> 11:51.087
OTPS stands for
"One Tablet Per Student."

11:51.089 --> 11:53.356
A plan to issue
free tablet computers

11:53.358 --> 11:56.493
to every elementary school
student in the state.

11:56.495 --> 11:57.994
For just $20 each,

11:57.996 --> 12:00.296
we can give every single child

12:00.298 --> 12:02.131
a computer to call their own,

12:02.133 --> 12:03.800
loaded with
educational software.

12:03.802 --> 12:06.869
Software provided by Samaritan.

12:06.871 --> 12:08.337
Tablet in every home,

12:08.339 --> 12:10.873
and a camera pointed at
the face of every child,

12:10.875 --> 12:12.809
<i>while Samaritan</i>
<i>controls everything</i>

12:12.811 --> 12:15.844
they see, learn, think.

12:17.380 --> 12:19.181
Speak of the devil.

12:19.183 --> 12:22.150
Something just started
hacking my phone.

12:22.152 --> 12:24.786
<i>Samaritan. It's coming</i>
<i>through Wilkins' computer!</i>

12:24.788 --> 12:27.389
Get out of there now!

12:29.459 --> 12:31.492
Veronique, I'm off the phone.

12:31.494 --> 12:35.197
How are you and Sebastian
getting--

12:35.199 --> 12:36.798
Pretty.

12:49.011 --> 12:51.679
Take the gun out of your purse
and put it in my hand.

12:57.554 --> 13:01.322
âª I can't give it up âª

13:01.324 --> 13:06.426
âª to someone else's touch âª

13:06.428 --> 13:08.162
And the one on your thigh.

13:08.164 --> 13:13.200
âª too much âª

13:15.336 --> 13:17.838
âª I can't give it up âª

13:17.840 --> 13:20.540
I heard you did a job
for the O'Bannons in Dublin.

13:20.542 --> 13:23.076
If I were to call
Paddy McCann about you,

13:23.078 --> 13:25.011
will he say good things?

13:25.013 --> 13:26.212
Probably not,

13:26.214 --> 13:28.382
since Paddy died two years ago.

13:28.384 --> 13:31.451
But you can call
Enzo Capizzi in Sicily,

13:31.453 --> 13:33.052
or you can check up
on the work I did

13:33.054 --> 13:34.755
for McCauley's crew in LA.

13:34.757 --> 13:38.258
Or you can just quit
wasting your time,

13:38.260 --> 13:40.226
and we can talk business.

13:41.629 --> 13:43.863
I can see why Romeo
recommended you so highly.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.700
Nothing unlocks doors
like a beautiful woman.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.735
<i>Ooh, he's hot.</i>

13:49.737 --> 13:53.872
I mean, not "hood and zip ties
in a CIA safe house

13:53.874 --> 13:56.074
with ten hours to kill" hot,
<i>but...</i>

13:56.076 --> 13:57.109
Bartender, two champagnes.

13:57.111 --> 13:59.077
I kind of get it.

13:59.079 --> 14:02.481
Root, what the hell
are you doing?

14:02.483 --> 14:05.083
Harold wanted me
off the streets for a while

14:05.085 --> 14:07.119
after my latest brush
with Samaritan,

14:07.121 --> 14:11.156
so I thought I'd help
keep an ear on you.

14:11.158 --> 14:14.126
He is a dangerous criminal
after all,

14:14.128 --> 14:18.831
and I just couldn't bear it
if anyone hurt you.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.166
I mean, besides me.

14:21.168 --> 14:22.500
So...

14:22.502 --> 14:23.735
Coming right up.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.838
What do you need me for?

14:26.840 --> 14:28.573
I can think of several things.

14:28.575 --> 14:30.308
Mm, subtle.

14:30.310 --> 14:32.109
I'll bet.

14:32.111 --> 14:36.648
But, uh, for now let's just

14:36.650 --> 14:39.083
keep it professional.

14:39.085 --> 14:42.419
Now, I'm willing to guess
that last night's job was a test

14:42.421 --> 14:45.022
to check
the NYPD's response time,

14:45.024 --> 14:49.994
which means that you have
something bigger lined up.

14:49.996 --> 14:53.030
See, now that was subtle.

14:53.032 --> 14:55.432
So...

14:55.434 --> 14:57.869
are you ready
for another score?

14:57.871 --> 15:00.036
That not so much.

15:00.038 --> 15:03.440
Maybe.

15:03.442 --> 15:06.142
But I'm not the kind of man
who likes to rush.

15:06.144 --> 15:07.944
A perfectly planned job

15:07.946 --> 15:11.548
is a kind of seduction.

15:11.550 --> 15:15.018
Hours looking, wanting,

15:15.020 --> 15:18.020
turning your target around
in your mind.

15:18.022 --> 15:21.557
And then...

15:21.559 --> 15:23.359
you move closer,

15:23.361 --> 15:26.362
brushing past,

15:26.364 --> 15:29.064
making contact

15:29.066 --> 15:31.634
just to see what will happen.

15:31.636 --> 15:35.004
And when everything's ready

15:35.006 --> 15:37.172
and when everything is right,

15:37.174 --> 15:40.409
all of that preparation

15:40.411 --> 15:43.879
pays off in one sudden,
intense, crashing moment.

15:43.881 --> 15:45.514
<i>He's good.</i>

15:45.516 --> 15:47.049
But a line like that

15:47.051 --> 15:48.650
would never work
on a trained operative like--

15:52.255 --> 15:54.756
Do you want to get out of here?

16:01.231 --> 16:03.398
Okay.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.234
Now, this is sexy.

16:13.108 --> 16:16.077
Plans for your next conquest?

16:16.079 --> 16:17.578
Maybe.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.080
Maybe not.

16:20.550 --> 16:22.683
Gentlemen,

16:22.685 --> 16:24.452
we have a decision to make.

16:24.454 --> 16:25.953
One of us got arrested today.

16:25.955 --> 16:27.555
It's just a drug charge,

16:27.557 --> 16:29.289
<i>but our operation</i>
<i>could be compromised.</i>

16:29.291 --> 16:31.291
Everything about her
checks out.

16:31.293 --> 16:32.860
But there's no way
for us to know

16:32.862 --> 16:34.361
whether she's working
with the police or not.

16:34.363 --> 16:37.130
This next job comes
with a very high risk factor,

16:37.132 --> 16:39.132
but it also comes
with very high reward.

16:39.134 --> 16:41.401
The client who hired us
is paying $2 million each

16:41.403 --> 16:44.871
for the jewels
inside of a single vault.

16:44.873 --> 16:49.809
So do we trust her
and take the score,

16:49.811 --> 16:52.812
or do we walk away
and get rid of the evidence?

16:59.420 --> 17:02.321
I say let's go for it.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.560
Then let's get to work.

17:08.563 --> 17:11.230
The plan's ready to go.

17:11.232 --> 17:12.598
All we need is you.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.766
Okay, so when were you
planning on doing this?

17:14.768 --> 17:17.836
20 minutes.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.182
Excuse me.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.417
Are you the concierge?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.185
Yes.
How may I help you, Miss...

17:34.187 --> 17:35.754
Stevens.

17:35.756 --> 17:37.756
I have some jewelry that--

17:37.758 --> 17:40.091
Well, it costs slightly more
than this hotel,

17:40.093 --> 17:42.027
and I don't think
I'll sleep well

17:42.029 --> 17:43.962
if it's in that little safe
in the room.

17:43.964 --> 17:48.466
Could you offer me
anything more secure?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.268
Of course.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.271
I'd be happy to store your items
in the hotel's vault.

17:53.273 --> 17:57.008
And I don't suppose I could
see this vault first, could I?

17:59.778 --> 18:02.780
<i>Bars are high-carbon steel,</i>
<i>locked at all times.</i>

18:02.782 --> 18:05.950
The vault itself, it's--

18:05.952 --> 18:08.118
Back up!
Now! Now!

18:15.293 --> 18:16.460
Cameras are dead.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.562
Footage of you is being erased.

18:20.965 --> 18:24.701
You really think you can crack
that before the cops get here?

18:31.376 --> 18:33.677
Cute, but that's gonna make
one hell of a noise.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.380
<i>All right, good to go.</i>

18:42.820 --> 18:44.320
It's Veterans Day.

18:44.322 --> 18:45.822
And we're three blocks away

18:45.824 --> 18:47.991
from the celebration
at The Intrepid.

18:47.993 --> 18:51.694
You're pretty proud
of yourself right now, huh?

18:59.836 --> 19:01.204
Hmm.

19:01.206 --> 19:03.005
Let's see.

19:03.007 --> 19:04.873
The ride here tripped
the relockers,

19:04.875 --> 19:06.709
so the front door's dead.

19:06.711 --> 19:08.343
But the friction
with the concrete

19:08.345 --> 19:11.780
ground down the back plate,
exposing the welds.

19:11.782 --> 19:13.348
Clever boy.

19:13.350 --> 19:15.217
Let him play.

19:15.219 --> 19:17.452
Your work is done.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.758
Prost.

19:25.694 --> 19:27.729
<i>Well, we have yet
to prevent a murder,</i>

19:27.731 --> 19:29.431
but we can add
another grand larceny

19:29.433 --> 19:31.065
to our list of accomplishments.

19:31.067 --> 19:33.602
<i>I'm hacking the hotel security</i>

19:33.604 --> 19:36.938
to determine precisely
what jewels you've stolen.

19:36.940 --> 19:38.940
Perhaps they're so valuable
<i>that Tomas is willing</i>

19:38.942 --> 19:41.375
to betray a client and kill his
teammates just to keep them.

19:41.377 --> 19:44.879
Hi, Shaw.
How's your date?

20:01.596 --> 20:03.631
Something's wrong here, Finch.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.166
Something's wrong indeed.

20:05.168 --> 20:07.134
<i>The only item in that vault</i>

20:07.136 --> 20:10.171
was placed there yesterday
by a guest of the hotel,

20:10.173 --> 20:14.240
Dr. Juilianna Petrova,
a researcher at the CDC.

20:14.242 --> 20:17.343
She's an expert on level four
<i>infectious diseases.</i>

20:17.345 --> 20:21.081
Miss Shaw, I'm no longer certain
that you were stealing jewels.

20:30.658 --> 20:32.192
I'm kind of thinking
maybe Tomas

20:32.194 --> 20:34.994
isn't the perpetrator
after all, Finch.

20:34.996 --> 20:36.496
Go!

20:56.485 --> 21:00.187
Place is clear, Shaw.
No sign of Max or Henrik.

21:02.124 --> 21:04.791
Six years I've been
working with those two.

21:04.793 --> 21:08.829
Six years and they just
turn on me like that.

21:08.831 --> 21:10.463
Any sign of the loot?

21:10.465 --> 21:12.966
Who you talking to?
And where the hell are we?

21:12.968 --> 21:14.300
I checked your address out.
This isn't it.

21:14.302 --> 21:17.170
Right now
the only address you need

21:17.172 --> 21:19.472
is the whiskey in that cabinet.

21:19.474 --> 21:22.342
So make mine a double,
yours too.

21:25.479 --> 21:28.814
Inside the safe,
there was a metal case

21:28.816 --> 21:30.683
<i>with, uh, "Marv" on the label.</i>

21:30.685 --> 21:33.553
Marv?

21:33.555 --> 21:36.656
Well, whatever it was,
Tomas' buddies have it now.

21:36.658 --> 21:38.091
<i>Oh, dear, this is bad.</i>

21:38.093 --> 21:39.259
This is very, very bad.

21:39.261 --> 21:40.693
Those labels don't say "Marv."

21:40.695 --> 21:42.194
<i>They say "Mar-V,"</i>

21:42.196 --> 21:43.896
as in "Marburg Virus,"

21:43.898 --> 21:45.731
a viral hemorrhagic fever

21:45.733 --> 21:48.233
with a mortality rate
approaching 90%.

21:48.235 --> 21:50.402
It's like Ebola's evil twin.

21:50.404 --> 21:51.837
<i>Dr. Petrova was in Uganda</i>

21:51.839 --> 21:53.505
<i>collecting samples</i>
<i>of the virus.</i>

21:53.507 --> 21:56.241
But due to the outbreak
of Ebola in Western Africa,

21:56.243 --> 21:58.110
her request to ship them
to the CDC

21:58.112 --> 22:00.379
was denied
by Homeland Security.

22:00.381 --> 22:02.514
<i>Rather than lose</i>
<i>months of research,</i>

22:02.516 --> 22:05.951
Dr. Petrova chose to smuggle
them into the US illegally.

22:05.953 --> 22:07.386
And now somebody stole them.

22:07.388 --> 22:08.687
If it makes you feel better,

22:08.689 --> 22:10.456
Dr. P's freaking out about it.

22:10.458 --> 22:13.592
She just turned herself in
to her bosses at the CDC.

22:13.594 --> 22:15.627
It would be difficult
to overstate the degree

22:15.629 --> 22:18.063
to which we do not
need ten vials of Marburg

22:18.065 --> 22:19.931
floating around the streets
of New York City.

22:19.933 --> 22:22.300
We have to find the virus and
the people who stole it fast.

22:22.302 --> 22:25.236
Okay, I'll track down
Max and Henrik,

22:25.238 --> 22:27.906
but we need to know
who they're working for.

22:27.908 --> 22:29.474
It was probably the same client

22:29.476 --> 22:31.209
<i>who hired Tomas</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

22:31.211 --> 22:33.578
Nobody else
knew about the robbery.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.413
Plus, paying those two
to kill Tomas

22:35.415 --> 22:38.583
is cheaper
than paying all three.

22:38.585 --> 22:40.585
Well, it is.

22:41.587 --> 22:43.887
So...

22:43.889 --> 22:46.890
who's your client?

22:46.892 --> 22:49.459
Who's yours?

22:49.461 --> 22:51.261
You're not just a thief,

22:51.263 --> 22:52.830
and you're definitely
not working alone.

22:52.832 --> 22:57.101
So why should I even trust you?

22:57.103 --> 22:59.402
You wanna talk
about trust, huh?

22:59.404 --> 23:02.472
Uh, you just stole
a very dangerous virus

23:02.474 --> 23:03.674
for some very dangerous people.

23:03.676 --> 23:04.974
Look, I never
would have done that

23:04.976 --> 23:06.143
if I knew what I was taking.

23:06.145 --> 23:07.309
I'm not a saint,

23:07.311 --> 23:09.845
but some things are too far,

23:09.847 --> 23:12.148
even for a man like me.

23:12.150 --> 23:16.818
Well, I doubt your client has
the same high moral standards.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.086
I need a name.

23:18.088 --> 23:19.087
Never got one.

23:19.089 --> 23:20.523
Anonymous emails,

23:20.525 --> 23:22.458
payments by one-time
wire transfer.

23:22.460 --> 23:26.528
It's better for everyone
if we don't use names.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.765
But I'm gonna find
the bastard behind this.

23:29.767 --> 23:32.467
I'm gonna steal
those vials back,

23:32.469 --> 23:35.203
and I'm gonna make him pay.

23:35.205 --> 23:38.339
You in?

23:38.341 --> 23:39.641
What do you think?

23:42.312 --> 23:44.779
I have a friend

23:44.781 --> 23:47.682
who can make
those anonymous emails

23:47.684 --> 23:49.484
way less anonymous.

23:53.055 --> 23:56.991
So this is
where the magic happens.

23:56.993 --> 24:00.161
Rented 10,000 square feet
of office space and filled it

24:00.163 --> 24:02.629
with state-of-the-art
3-D printers.

24:02.631 --> 24:05.066
Almost all the 12 million
went to paying for these,

24:05.068 --> 24:07.234
but once
they're up and running,

24:07.236 --> 24:10.337
we'll be making
all the tablets right here

24:10.339 --> 24:11.839
in New York.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.641
That's our prototype.

24:14.643 --> 24:17.977
Just imagine giving one of those
to every kid in the state.

24:17.979 --> 24:19.079
Amazing.

24:19.081 --> 24:20.547
<i>I'll tell the Governor</i>

24:20.549 --> 24:23.550
our grant money
is in good hands.

24:23.552 --> 24:27.688
Why are you guys
putting up cameras?

24:27.690 --> 24:31.024
I'm from the Public Relations
Office, Jerrod.

24:31.026 --> 24:32.692
<i>The Governor wants a time lapse</i>

24:32.694 --> 24:34.660
of your tablets being made
<i>to put on our website.</i>

24:34.662 --> 24:37.563
Or an evil AI
wants to keep a close eye

24:37.565 --> 24:39.199
on its baby brainwashers.

24:39.201 --> 24:40.767
Our intrusion
into Wilkins' computer

24:40.769 --> 24:42.535
must have put Samaritan
on alert,

24:42.537 --> 24:44.604
making it
that much more difficult

24:44.606 --> 24:47.172
to do what we must.

24:47.174 --> 24:49.275
<i>Difficult but...</i>

24:49.277 --> 24:51.344
we'll find a way in.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.918
But first we'll need
to go shopping.

25:03.624 --> 25:05.523
<i>Any progress finding
the virus, Mr. Reese?</i>

25:05.525 --> 25:07.726
Well, I tracked down
Max and Henrik,

25:07.728 --> 25:09.427
but I don't think
they're gonna talk.

25:09.429 --> 25:11.596
I searched their bodies.

25:11.598 --> 25:13.431
<i>No phones, no wallets,</i>

25:13.433 --> 25:15.467
and no sign of the virus.

25:15.469 --> 25:17.302
So it would seem that Tomas
is not the only one

25:17.304 --> 25:19.371
that this client
has double-crossed.

25:19.373 --> 25:22.106
Well, if these guys
knew who he was,

25:22.108 --> 25:24.776
maybe someone else does too.

25:30.549 --> 25:31.883
<i>You waste my time.</i>

25:31.885 --> 25:35.453
Your drug charge is <i>podrobka.</i>

25:35.455 --> 25:37.121
You'll never make it stick.

25:37.123 --> 25:38.622
I won't have to.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.292
See, it's
a homicide investigation now.

25:43.061 --> 25:44.262
You wouldn't want to tell me

25:44.264 --> 25:46.898
about your friend Tomas,
would you?

25:46.900 --> 25:49.300
I've been here since yesterday.

25:49.302 --> 25:51.068
I have nothing to do
with his death.

25:51.070 --> 25:52.969
I never said he was
the one who died.

25:52.971 --> 25:57.240
The homicide I'm working,
it's a double.

25:57.242 --> 26:00.311
See, whoever hired you three
to take out Tomas,

26:00.313 --> 26:02.446
this is how
they settled the check.

26:02.448 --> 26:04.281
Now, if I were you,

26:04.283 --> 26:06.483
I'd like to be sipping
a nice glass of champagne

26:06.485 --> 26:08.319
on our first flight to nowhere,

26:08.321 --> 26:10.753
instead of a sitting duck
in a jail cell.

26:10.755 --> 26:15.859
But maybe I'm wasting
your time.

26:17.628 --> 26:20.297
I like Tomas.

26:20.299 --> 26:22.332
But business is business.

26:22.334 --> 26:24.534
What was the deal?

26:26.937 --> 26:28.638
Half a million extra each

26:28.640 --> 26:32.141
for me, Max, and Henrik.

26:32.143 --> 26:34.811
Tomas cracks the vault and...

26:36.947 --> 26:38.815
Well, that was the plan anyway.

26:38.817 --> 26:41.217
Plan? Whose plan?
Who was the client?

26:41.219 --> 26:43.285
It was like
the rest of the job.

26:43.287 --> 26:46.222
One-time wires,
no-name emails.

26:46.224 --> 26:48.991
But whoever he was,

26:48.993 --> 26:50.392
he knew everything.

26:50.394 --> 26:52.061
He knew Tomas
was the only person

26:52.063 --> 26:54.129
to pull off a plan like this.

26:54.131 --> 26:58.167
He also knew Tomas
wouldn't have done it

26:58.169 --> 27:01.002
if he knew
what he was stealing.

27:03.572 --> 27:05.406
And he knew for the right price

27:05.408 --> 27:08.209
you three would turn
on a friend.

27:15.584 --> 27:19.653
Okay, Harold, why are we here?

27:19.655 --> 27:21.255
It's bread crumbs, Ms. Shaw.

27:21.257 --> 27:25.192
My attempts to trace
the emails and wire transfers

27:25.194 --> 27:27.027
<i>provided by Tomas and Katya</i>

27:27.029 --> 27:29.563
<i>have yet to reveal</i>
<i>their client's identity.</i>

27:29.565 --> 27:31.265
But yesterday
the client wired money

27:31.267 --> 27:33.867
to pay for storage
at that address.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.835
Knight & Morris,

27:35.837 --> 27:39.273
the oldest and most secure
storage facility in New York,

27:39.275 --> 27:41.875
housing everything
from priceless heirlooms

27:41.877 --> 27:43.243
to renaissance art.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.012
In their 95-year history,

27:45.014 --> 27:47.047
they have never been robbed.

27:47.049 --> 27:49.783
<i>They are, simply put,</i>
<i>a fortress.</i>

27:49.785 --> 27:51.851
So of course
that's where the vials are now.

27:51.853 --> 27:53.720
To locate them precisely,

27:53.722 --> 27:55.889
we still need to know
the client's name.

27:57.925 --> 27:59.358
Son of a...

27:59.360 --> 28:01.093
Marko.

28:01.095 --> 28:02.128
<i>Marko?</i>

28:02.130 --> 28:03.596
Marko Jevtic?

28:03.598 --> 28:05.864
<i>The partner</i>
<i>that died in Prague?</i>

28:05.866 --> 28:07.533
Wait, didn't you kill that guy?

28:07.535 --> 28:09.735
I've never killed anyone.

28:09.737 --> 28:11.637
We tried to spring Marko out
after he got caught,

28:11.639 --> 28:13.973
but it was too risky.

28:13.975 --> 28:17.609
So either he's a really
well-preserved corpse,

28:17.611 --> 28:19.878
or he escaped
by faking his own death.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.380
<i>Marko thinks
we left him to rot,</i>

28:21.382 --> 28:23.749
and this whole double-cross
is his revenge.

28:23.751 --> 28:25.317
Revenge or not,
Jevtic is in possession

28:25.319 --> 28:26.618
of a deadly virus,

28:26.620 --> 28:27.953
and I would very much
like to know

28:27.955 --> 28:29.588
<i>what he intends to do with it.</i>

28:31.391 --> 28:34.493
My buyer just transferred
half the money.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.328
We get the rest
when the package is delivered.

28:36.330 --> 28:38.596
<i>We move at midnight.</i>

28:38.598 --> 28:39.965
So that gives us
less than six hours

28:39.967 --> 28:42.667
to figure out
how to rob this place.

28:45.438 --> 28:47.572
We have another problem,
Harold.

28:47.574 --> 28:50.241
I'm looking at an operative
from the relevant side.

28:50.243 --> 28:51.843
<i>A government agent?</i>

28:51.845 --> 28:53.845
Are you certain?
How do you know?

28:53.847 --> 28:55.580
Because I trained him.

28:55.582 --> 28:58.616
<i>Devon Grice, Crimson Six Alpha.</i>

28:58.618 --> 29:01.452
I know him and his partner.

29:01.454 --> 29:02.987
Now that Marko has the virus,

29:02.989 --> 29:06.657
this whole damn thing
just went relevant.

29:17.217 --> 29:21.290
_

29:21.325 --> 29:22.678
<i>Uplink's good.</i>

29:22.680 --> 29:24.947
NSA feeds online.

29:24.949 --> 29:28.918
You ever miss the old days,
Brooks?

29:28.920 --> 29:29.919
The old system?

29:29.921 --> 29:31.220
Why?

29:31.222 --> 29:32.755
Research 2.0 targets
more threats

29:32.757 --> 29:34.256
than the old system ever did.

29:34.258 --> 29:35.356
Well, that's just it.

29:35.358 --> 29:36.558
Back then,
we did the targeting,

29:36.560 --> 29:37.959
had to scrutinize
our own intel,

29:37.961 --> 29:39.961
think for ourselves.

29:39.963 --> 29:42.631
When we lit up a target,
we knew why.

29:42.633 --> 29:45.600
Now instead of numbers
to investigate,

29:45.602 --> 29:48.269
we just get numbers to kill.

29:50.973 --> 29:52.873
You don't think that's strange?

29:52.875 --> 29:54.942
We don't get paid
to think, Grice.

29:54.944 --> 29:56.977
And Control wouldn't like
what you're saying.

29:56.979 --> 29:59.547
You remember what happened
to Indigo Five, right?

29:59.549 --> 30:03.151
I heard Shaw lived to fight
another day.

30:03.153 --> 30:04.752
Nobody lives,

30:04.754 --> 30:07.455
and no good
comes of asking questions.

30:10.458 --> 30:13.827
Our orders are
to eliminate all targets

30:13.829 --> 30:16.263
and destroy every last drop
of this virus.

30:16.265 --> 30:18.632
We strike at 2200.

30:22.437 --> 30:24.571
But if the relevant side
is taking care of the virus,

30:24.573 --> 30:26.506
perhaps our work here is done.

30:26.508 --> 30:28.575
<i>Now that Samaritan is</i>
<i>providing the relevant numbers</i>

30:28.577 --> 30:29.976
<i>to the government,</i>

30:29.978 --> 30:31.678
any encounter
with those operatives

30:31.680 --> 30:33.113
could easily escalate

30:33.115 --> 30:35.182
into a run-in
with Samaritan's agents.

30:35.184 --> 30:38.118
Why expose our operation
to unnecessary risk?

30:38.120 --> 30:40.520
<i>Because I know how the
relevant side works, Finch.</i>

30:40.522 --> 30:41.921
And I know Grice and Brooks.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.590
After they kill Marko
and his men,

30:43.592 --> 30:45.357
they're gonna track down
everyone involved

30:45.359 --> 30:46.826
in stealing the virus,

30:46.828 --> 30:48.527
and they're gonna
kill them too.

30:48.529 --> 30:52.098
Tomas is trying
to make this right.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.332
He may be a criminal,

30:53.334 --> 30:56.035
but he doesn't deserve to die.

30:56.037 --> 30:58.204
<i>And isn't that</i>
<i>what we're here for,</i>

30:58.206 --> 31:00.272
to save his life?

31:00.274 --> 31:02.007
She's got you there, Finch.

31:02.009 --> 31:04.776
Besides, the Soviets messed
around with weaponizing Marburg.

31:04.778 --> 31:06.545
The Americans never did.

31:06.547 --> 31:07.946
Do you really want
the relevant side

31:07.948 --> 31:09.515
to get their hands
on that virus?

31:09.517 --> 31:11.717
Or let them turn it over
to Samaritan?

31:11.719 --> 31:14.620
<i>The only way to make
sure those vials get destroyed</i>

31:14.622 --> 31:16.521
is to do it ourselves.

31:16.523 --> 31:18.289
Fine, we'll commit your felony.

31:18.291 --> 31:19.858
But unfortunately,

31:19.860 --> 31:22.794
I have another criminal act
to attend to first.

31:22.796 --> 31:25.130
Ms. Groves,
I'm on my way.

31:25.132 --> 31:27.565
<i>Good, Wilkins is about
to leave for the night.</i>

31:31.237 --> 31:35.072
And now we are cooking.

31:35.074 --> 31:37.342
Nice work, you guys.

31:37.344 --> 31:39.710
First batch should be done
by morning.

31:46.948 --> 31:51.548
_

32:04.288 --> 32:07.321
_

32:08.164 --> 32:11.448
_

32:12.491 --> 32:16.675
_

32:33.690 --> 32:35.380
_

32:36.353 --> 32:39.490
_

32:40.372 --> 32:43.439
<i>Samaritan's blind, Harold.
You're up.</i>

32:48.412 --> 32:49.545
Accessing the system.

32:49.547 --> 32:52.381
I'll need about ten minutes.

32:56.586 --> 32:57.820
Yes?

32:57.822 --> 32:59.487
I got a text
offering me 3,000 bucks

32:59.489 --> 33:01.957
if I can fix your internet
in the next five minutes.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.726
I don't want to rush you,
Harold,

33:03.728 --> 33:05.794
but I think Samaritan's
onto us.

33:05.796 --> 33:07.830
Surprisingly, Ms. Groves,

33:07.832 --> 33:09.831
that does not
help me concentrate.

33:23.712 --> 33:27.948
Harold, I'm about to do
something you're not gonna like.

33:30.285 --> 33:32.553
No need.
I'm done.

33:44.999 --> 33:46.733
Okay, get in,
get the virus, get out.

33:46.735 --> 33:51.504
Got a job in Barcelona
next month.

33:51.506 --> 33:54.507
If we live through this,
you should join me.

33:54.509 --> 33:57.510
I already have a job.

33:57.512 --> 33:59.645
It's weird, the pay sucks,

33:59.647 --> 34:02.182
but, uh...

34:02.184 --> 34:05.151
we could use a guy like you.

34:05.153 --> 34:08.654
I'm in position, Ms. Shaw.

34:08.656 --> 34:10.356
I've circumvented
the building's firewall

34:10.358 --> 34:13.426
and accessed their security.

34:13.428 --> 34:14.659
Ready when you are.

34:23.536 --> 34:27.339
Command, we're
in the middle of something.

34:27.341 --> 34:28.674
<i>We're aware, Crimson Six.</i>

34:28.676 --> 34:30.309
<i>But new orders</i>
<i>just came through.</i>

34:30.311 --> 34:33.011
<i>You are instructed</i>
<i>to eliminate all targets</i>

34:33.013 --> 34:34.779
<i>and secure the vials.</i>

34:34.781 --> 34:36.681
Our orders were to destroy
that virus, not--

34:36.683 --> 34:39.318
You are to secure the vials
and turn them over intact

34:39.320 --> 34:41.953
<i>to a contact already en route.</i>

34:41.955 --> 34:43.822
A contact for whom?

34:43.824 --> 34:45.690
<i>That's need-to-know,</i>
<i>Crimson Six.</i>

34:45.692 --> 34:47.058
<i>Do you acknowledge?</i>

34:47.060 --> 34:48.393
<i>Repeat, do you acknowledge?</i>

34:48.395 --> 34:50.128
Acknowledged.

34:57.870 --> 34:59.504
We're not on camera,
are we, Finch?

34:59.506 --> 35:01.139
<i>Not yet.</i>

35:01.141 --> 35:02.540
And you should know
that you're not alone.

35:02.542 --> 35:04.208
<i>Our friends</i>
<i>from the relevant side</i>

35:04.210 --> 35:06.577
are in the building.

35:06.579 --> 35:09.046
Which means Central Command
will be running op-sec

35:09.048 --> 35:11.549
from a remote location.

35:11.551 --> 35:13.184
<i>If you see us,</i>

35:13.186 --> 35:14.852
so will they.

35:14.854 --> 35:16.587
That's why I'm looping
the security feeds

35:16.589 --> 35:18.422
to cover your tracks.

35:46.016 --> 35:48.851
<i>Marko's vault
is fifth on your left.</i>

35:48.853 --> 35:51.254
And please work quickly.
The others aren't far behind.

36:01.399 --> 36:02.799
Not bad.

36:02.801 --> 36:04.767
Now, how are
those magic fingers

36:04.769 --> 36:06.302
gonna open that one?

36:10.107 --> 36:11.273
Hmm.

36:21.784 --> 36:22.784
<i>Sorry, my friend.</i>

36:26.490 --> 36:29.624
But unlike you, I don't leave
important things behind.

36:31.293 --> 36:34.830
I knew you would come
for these, Tomas,

36:34.832 --> 36:36.631
just like I knew you would
never be bold enough

36:36.633 --> 36:38.934
to steal them
if you really knew the score,

36:38.936 --> 36:40.902
which is convenient.

36:40.904 --> 36:43.238
You see, my buyer
wants the virus delivered

36:43.240 --> 36:44.905
right here in New York City.

36:44.907 --> 36:46.674
And who better
to start a pandemic

36:46.676 --> 36:49.910
than two healthy human hosts?

37:03.902 --> 37:05.835
<i>We were planning
to get you out, Marko,</i>

37:05.837 --> 37:07.504
but we got word that you died.

37:07.506 --> 37:09.139
If I had known
that you were still--

37:09.141 --> 37:11.508
You know how painful it is
to fake your own death?

37:11.510 --> 37:15.178
What the toxins
that simulate cardiac arrest

37:15.180 --> 37:17.414
do to your health?

37:21.118 --> 37:23.086
This will be worse.

37:23.088 --> 37:24.754
<i>I hate to
trouble you, Ms. Shaw,</i>

37:24.756 --> 37:26.923
<i>but your counterparts</i>
<i>from the relevant side</i>

37:26.925 --> 37:29.259
are about to turn
this perilous situation

37:29.261 --> 37:31.360
into something
dangerously chaotic,

37:31.362 --> 37:33.429
so it may get a bit loud.

37:44.207 --> 37:47.176
Now, John!

37:47.178 --> 37:48.877
What the--

37:54.817 --> 37:56.451
Who the hell are these guys?

37:56.453 --> 37:58.120
Highly trained
government assassins

37:58.122 --> 38:00.522
with orders to kill.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.960
It's not cool you ask me
to do this stuff with you, man.

38:05.962 --> 38:07.262
Not cool!

38:23.445 --> 38:24.779
Admit it,

38:24.781 --> 38:26.780
we're not bad together.

38:28.451 --> 38:31.885
You're just saying that
because I saved your ass.

38:31.887 --> 38:33.120
Come on.

38:33.122 --> 38:35.523
You, me, Barcelona.

38:35.525 --> 38:37.458
Score worth 1.6 mil.

38:37.460 --> 38:40.127
You sure you won't come?

38:40.129 --> 38:43.697
You, me, here, no pay.

38:43.699 --> 38:45.231
We both eventually
wind up dead.

38:45.233 --> 38:46.967
Are you sure you won't stay?

38:49.637 --> 38:51.638
Ms. Shaw and Mr. Koroa
are leaving, John.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.740
<i>And considering</i>
<i>that the police are en route,</i>

38:53.742 --> 38:57.544
now might be a good time
for you to make your exit too.

39:28.742 --> 39:31.376
Freeze.

39:32.878 --> 39:35.280
<i>Shaw?</i>

39:40.786 --> 39:41.886
Go.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.624
Go!

39:54.476 --> 39:57.118
_

40:03.242 --> 40:05.076
I got a call about a fire
on the second floor.

40:05.078 --> 40:07.311
Suite 205, the 3-D printers,
are they okay?

40:07.313 --> 40:09.146
Whole building's trashed,
buddy.

40:11.383 --> 40:12.650
No.

40:12.652 --> 40:14.151
No, no, no, no, no.

40:14.153 --> 40:17.255
11.2 million up in smoke.

40:17.257 --> 40:19.089
I doubt the Governor
could give him any more money

40:19.091 --> 40:22.292
without attracting attention
Samaritan doesn't want.

40:22.294 --> 40:24.962
By now, the worm I planted
will have destroyed

40:24.964 --> 40:26.730
<i>every last copy</i>
<i>of Wilkins' design.</i>

40:26.732 --> 40:30.600
So no tablets for the kids.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.302
Mission accomplished.

40:32.304 --> 40:36.640
Famous last words.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.642
While I was sabotaging
the printers,

40:38.644 --> 40:42.279
I took a quick look
at the tablet's OS.

40:42.281 --> 40:44.748
There was maybe
one suspicious line of code,

40:44.750 --> 40:48.818
and I'm not even sure
it had any nefarious purpose.

40:48.820 --> 40:51.288
Harold, you really
think Samaritan

40:51.290 --> 40:52.756
was building those things

40:52.758 --> 40:54.924
out of the goodness
of its own heart?

40:54.926 --> 40:56.993
When Castro was
coming to power in Cuba,

40:56.995 --> 40:59.528
the first thing he did was
build schools, good schools,

40:59.530 --> 41:01.931
so that the people
would love him.

41:01.933 --> 41:07.804
I know that Samaritan's motives
are amoral at best,

41:07.806 --> 41:10.506
but the thing that
Mr. Wilkins was trying to do

41:10.508 --> 41:13.275
was an absolute good,
and we destroyed it.

41:13.277 --> 41:15.844
I'm not sure what
we're becoming, Ms. Groves,

41:15.846 --> 41:17.045
and it does make me wonder...

41:17.047 --> 41:18.380
How much wrong
are we willing to do

41:18.382 --> 41:20.549
in the name of right?

41:32.661 --> 41:34.229
I'm sure not having the machine

41:34.231 --> 41:35.997
in your ear anymore
sucks and all,

41:35.999 --> 41:37.899
but it is pretty great

41:37.901 --> 41:41.036
finally being able
to sneak up on you.

41:41.038 --> 41:44.306
I live to amuse.

41:44.308 --> 41:46.341
Where's Tomas?

41:46.343 --> 41:48.042
Halfway to Barcelona.

41:48.044 --> 41:49.877
He gave me a pretty hard sell,

41:49.879 --> 41:51.212
trying to get me
to go with him,

41:51.214 --> 41:54.248
and for a hot second,
I almost did.

41:54.250 --> 41:58.185
But?

41:58.187 --> 42:01.856
I guess there are things
I care about here.

42:01.858 --> 42:06.560
And is that why
you came to see me?

42:06.562 --> 42:08.195
No.

42:08.197 --> 42:10.397
I need you to translate
Finch's instructions

42:10.399 --> 42:12.432
on how to destroy the virus.

42:12.434 --> 42:15.169
Dude never met a five-syllable
word he didn't like.

42:15.171 --> 42:17.204
Full decontamination.

42:17.206 --> 42:21.040
This could take all night.

42:23.210 --> 42:25.945
We haven't recovered
the virus yet.

42:25.947 --> 42:28.047
Are you sure we shouldn't
be tracking it down?

42:28.049 --> 42:30.250
We have new orders

42:30.252 --> 42:33.720
and a list of new numbers to
take care of in South America.

42:33.722 --> 42:38.024
Nothing good
comes out of asking questions.

42:39.193 --> 42:40.193
Remember?

43:04.918 --> 43:06.101
Go. _
