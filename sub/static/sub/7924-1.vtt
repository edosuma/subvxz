01:04.530 --> 01:08.860
For some, time passes slowly.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.160
An hour can seem an eternity.

01:12.200 --> 01:16.000
For others,
there's never enough.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.670
For the Tucks, it didn't exist.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.020
Time is like a wheel...

01:33.050 --> 01:37.510
turning and turning,
never stopping

01:37.560 --> 01:44.190
and the woods are the center,
the hub of the wheel.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.340
It began the first week
of summer

01:59.380 --> 02:05.150
a strange and breathless time,
when accident, or fate

02:05.190 --> 02:07.980
bring lives together

02:08.020 --> 02:10.320
when people are led
to do things

02:10.360 --> 02:12.830
they've never done before.

02:15.030 --> 02:19.830
On this summer's day,
not so very long ago

02:19.870 --> 02:25.500
the wheel set lives in motion
in mysterious ways.

02:25.540 --> 02:27.870
It set Mae Tuck out
in her wagon

02:27.910 --> 02:29.840
for the village of Treegap

02:29.880 --> 02:35.040
to meet her two sons as she did
once every ten years.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.870
Ma!

03:30.910 --> 03:32.170
Miles!

03:32.210 --> 03:33.500
Jesse!

03:33.540 --> 03:34.840
Oh...!

03:36.040 --> 03:37.010
Oh, I missed you.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.170
What are you doing here?

03:38.210 --> 03:39.510
Oh, I couldn't wait to see you.

03:39.550 --> 03:40.510
I missed you, Jesse.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.020
Oh, wait,
I got something for you.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.020
Oh, look at you.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.020
I got something.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.020
Here, look.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.380
The Eiffel Tower.

03:46.420 --> 03:47.650
Would you look at that.

03:47.690 --> 03:48.990
Got it in Paris, France.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.460
Oh, Mom,
you've never seen anything

03:50.490 --> 03:51.820
- So tall in your life.
- Hello...

03:51.860 --> 03:53.850
Oh, I got something else.
I got something else.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.860
How are you, old friend?

03:54.900 --> 03:56.190
Your favorite... chocolates.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.860
Oh, I've died
and gone to Heaven.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.200
Oh, Jesse.

03:59.230 --> 04:01.760
Miles...

04:03.700 --> 04:05.260
Miles.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.040
Give your mother a hug.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.970
Ten years.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.850
You're as cozy as barbed wire.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.280
I have you back.

04:25.860 --> 04:29.300
Winifred!

04:29.330 --> 04:31.490
Winifred!

04:31.530 --> 04:33.870
Yes, Mother?

04:35.870 --> 04:38.500
I need a new name.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.270
One that's not all worn out
from being called so much.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.440
Come inside this instant.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.710
You're getting filthy!

04:53.020 --> 04:54.510
Ow! I can scarcely breathe.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.850
"You must suffer
to be beautiful."

04:58.890 --> 05:00.360
So say the French.

05:00.390 --> 05:02.160
The French are crazy.

05:10.110 --> 05:14.510
For Winnie Foster

05:14.540 --> 05:17.570
the heat of summer was not
nearly as stifling

05:17.610 --> 05:19.600
as the formality of her life.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.150
With every passing day

05:28.190 --> 05:30.750
the feeling grew stronger.

05:30.790 --> 05:33.630
She was coming closer
to the end of something

05:33.660 --> 05:36.820
and moving towards
the beginning of something new.

05:48.180 --> 05:51.010
Change was in the air.

05:51.050 --> 05:56.850
It was only a question of when.

06:08.330 --> 06:10.060
Wait for me in the car.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.620
I won't be a minute.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.130
In the car, Mrs. Foster.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.730
Throw it home! Throw it home!

06:17.770 --> 06:19.240
Come on, throw it home!

06:19.270 --> 06:20.300
- Go!
- Run to me!

06:20.340 --> 06:21.310
Yay!

06:21.340 --> 06:22.930
No, no, no, no, no.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.040
Too large for tea cakes.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.980
None of these will do.

06:27.010 --> 06:29.540
I prefer petit fours.

06:29.580 --> 06:32.550
What kind of a funny hat
is that?

06:32.590 --> 06:34.140
Well, look'ee here.

06:34.220 --> 06:37.950
If it's not Miss Moneybags
in her fancy car.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.020
What's the matter?

06:41.060 --> 06:43.150
Don't want
to get your feet dirty?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.160
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Foster.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.330
Not much call
for such treats out here.

06:49.370 --> 06:52.030
Well, I could just make them up
for you, special.

06:52.070 --> 06:53.130
Winnie Foster?

06:53.170 --> 06:54.640
You've got to be kidding!

06:54.680 --> 06:55.840
Wow!

06:55.880 --> 06:57.140
Winnie, run!

06:57.180 --> 07:00.080
Run, Winnie, run!

07:00.110 --> 07:02.410
Throw it! Throw it!

07:02.450 --> 07:03.920
Throw it home! Come on!

07:03.950 --> 07:05.650
Slide, Winnie, slide!

07:06.690 --> 07:08.320
Winifred!

07:33.180 --> 07:35.840
Oh, and they had
their arms crossed

07:35.880 --> 07:38.820
and you see, the lines
were perfectly square.

07:38.850 --> 07:39.910
Come here, come here.

07:39.950 --> 07:41.150
I want to teach you. Come on.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.480
Oh, all the way from France.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.680
How about that?

07:43.720 --> 07:45.090
Oh, look. Look-Look at this one.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.490
I want to see, Pop. Let me see.

07:46.530 --> 07:47.500
Look it.

07:47.530 --> 07:50.020
Oh! Aah, he shot me!

07:50.060 --> 07:51.890
Oh, I'm dead!

07:51.930 --> 07:54.090
Oh, oh, my!

07:54.130 --> 07:55.500
Oh, my!

07:55.540 --> 07:57.510
Oh, you'll have to see this one.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.170
Miles, look at this!

08:00.210 --> 08:02.770
Oh... let's see.

08:02.810 --> 08:04.370
Okay, come here,
I want to show you.

08:04.410 --> 08:05.610
I want to show you.

08:05.650 --> 08:06.810
All right.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.910
Good to have you home, son.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.620
I'm glad to see you.

08:15.660 --> 08:20.290
And the family together.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.990
But don't get used to it.

08:23.030 --> 08:25.300
War's coming, I hear.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.960
I'm joining up.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.460
I'm going to fight the Huns.

08:31.510 --> 08:34.840
Get as far away
from this place as I can.

08:43.020 --> 08:48.650
Oh, you think
that'll solve things, do you?

08:48.690 --> 08:53.530
You haven't had enough killing
for two lifetimes?

09:00.700 --> 09:04.930
Somebody's on to us.

09:04.970 --> 09:08.460
I know it.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.070
There's a man who's been
following us

09:16.120 --> 09:18.310
and we've lost him
several times, but...

09:20.350 --> 09:23.550
he keeps coming back.

09:29.160 --> 09:34.360
I think he knows something.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.800
This man...

09:41.880 --> 09:43.140
Jesse...

09:43.180 --> 09:44.670
Whoo!

09:44.710 --> 09:47.740
We're being tracked.

09:49.780 --> 09:52.150
Oh, Miles, we lost him.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.520
Don't go spoiling everything.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.820
Yeah, we lost him, Jess...

09:57.860 --> 10:01.490
but he keeps coming back.

10:01.530 --> 10:05.160
It was only a matter of time
before someone found us.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.600
The world is closing in.

10:10.700 --> 10:14.830
Entire forest is almost gone.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.570
All except this little wood.

10:22.450 --> 10:26.850
I saw tire marks down
on the lower wash...

10:26.890 --> 10:29.910
a few weeks ago.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.520
There'll be more.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.930
I don't want anyone going
to town.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.360
Not for anything,
and that's that.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.800
Tuck.

10:39.830 --> 10:42.730
You see any strangers
in the woods getting too close

10:42.770 --> 10:43.900
you know what to do.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.740
No exceptions.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.740
Our time here is almost done.

10:57.250 --> 11:01.450
I can feel it.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.280
You'll never catch one that way.

11:23.780 --> 11:27.180
Do you know
about catching fireflies?

11:27.280 --> 11:28.680
Afraid not, never tried.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.180
I prefer... bigger game.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.840
Though I suspect the strategy

11:31.890 --> 11:33.290
is much the same.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.690
Strategy?

11:34.720 --> 11:37.850
One must never announce
one's presence to the prey.

11:37.890 --> 11:40.020
One must become part
of the scenery...

11:40.060 --> 11:41.360
invisible...

11:41.400 --> 11:43.960
almost disappear.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.970
And be patient

11:47.000 --> 11:49.770
until the exact, right moment

11:49.800 --> 11:51.830
arrives...

11:54.140 --> 11:57.700
Take a prisoner.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.040
For you?

11:59.080 --> 12:01.380
No, thank you.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.550
You're quite right.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.150
A girl of your age
should find...

12:07.220 --> 12:08.690
trapping suitors
more interesting

12:08.720 --> 12:10.120
than trapping insects, anyway.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.650
Far easier, I might add.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.930
Have you lived here long?

12:17.970 --> 12:20.160
Forever. Why?

12:20.270 --> 12:24.360
I'm... looking
for some old friends

12:24.410 --> 12:26.840
who live hereabouts.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.340
Thought you might
help me find them.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.740
My father
practically built Treegap.

12:30.780 --> 12:32.010
He knows everyone.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.670
Perhaps he can help you.

12:33.710 --> 12:34.840
Perhaps.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.510
I quite like talking to you.

12:37.550 --> 12:40.020
Winifred?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.180
Winifred, who are you talking to
out there?

12:42.220 --> 12:43.850
I don't know.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.530
He hasn't told me his name.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.160
Good evening, madam.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.170
Please forgive my intrusion.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.800
This young lady tells me
you've lived here forever.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.100
I thought you might know
of a certain family

12:58.140 --> 12:59.400
goes by the name of...

12:59.440 --> 13:01.770
I hardly know everyone,
nor do I want to.

13:01.810 --> 13:04.640
And I don't stand outside
discussing such a thing

13:04.680 --> 13:06.270
with... strangers.

13:06.310 --> 13:09.840
Then I beg your pardon.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.410
Good evening, young lady.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.440
Madam.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.550
This is why I worry
about you, Winifred.

13:20.590 --> 13:24.830
You don't have the sense
not to talk to a man like that.

13:29.740 --> 13:32.900
A proper education gains one
entrÃ© into society.

13:32.940 --> 13:36.600
Your mother and I have given
this a great deal of thought.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.440
Middlehouse Academy for Girls

13:38.480 --> 13:41.280
in Pensford,
has an excellent reputation.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.310
Middlehouse?

13:45.350 --> 13:49.290
But that's a terrible place,
everyone says so.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.650
It's like a jail.

13:50.690 --> 13:51.660
Nonsense.

13:51.690 --> 13:54.530
Girls emerge from there
as refined young ladies

13:54.560 --> 13:56.830
well-versed in etiquette
and manners,

13:56.860 --> 13:58.990
both of which
you are sorely lacking.

13:59.030 --> 14:01.500
But I don't want to be
one of those girls.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.000
Which is precisely why
you must go.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.130
I cannot let
your unbridled nature

14:07.180 --> 14:09.270
ruin your chances
for a respectable future.

14:09.310 --> 14:11.900
Winifred... I'm sorry...

14:11.950 --> 14:16.010
but we have to do
what's best for you.

14:19.190 --> 14:21.820
I won't do it.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.450
I'm not like those girls.

14:23.490 --> 14:24.460
I won't go!

14:24.490 --> 14:25.550
Winifred!

14:25.590 --> 14:27.690
I won't go!

14:37.000 --> 14:43.170
Winnie Foster was to be sent
500 miles away to be educated.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.650
But what her parents didn't
understand

14:46.680 --> 14:50.280
was she only wanted to step
just outside her fence...

14:50.320 --> 14:53.010
so she did.

15:00.860 --> 15:05.460
What in these quiet woods
should be so forbidden?

15:07.200 --> 15:10.530
Winnie had always sensed
a mystery

15:10.570 --> 15:12.800
waiting for her there.

15:14.810 --> 15:21.540
It was a place so entirely
different from what she knew

15:21.580 --> 15:24.950
so far away from her tight,
pruned world.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.280
Ah!

16:31.490 --> 16:32.470
Ah...

16:54.880 --> 16:57.840
How long have you been
standing there?

16:57.880 --> 17:00.180
Not long at all.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.380
I was only walking past,
and I...

17:03.420 --> 17:06.349
Well, you shouldn't...

17:06.390 --> 17:09.880
be in these parts of the woods.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.520
It's best you turn around
and go home.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.660
Well, go on, now, get!

17:20.700 --> 17:25.099
Excuse me,
but I own these woods, and...

17:25.140 --> 17:27.800
I'll go on and get
when I want to.

17:29.010 --> 17:31.070
You own these woods?

17:31.110 --> 17:33.140
Yes, I do.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.010
What's your name?

17:40.050 --> 17:43.780
Winifred.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.490
Winnie... Foster.

17:45.530 --> 17:48.790
A Foster?

17:48.830 --> 17:50.350
Well, I'll be.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.370
Is that a fact?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.930
Well... Winnie Foster,
like I was saying

17:56.970 --> 18:00.170
you need to turn around
and go home.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.300
It just so happens
that I was on my way home

18:03.340 --> 18:04.900
before you made
your rude suggestion

18:04.950 --> 18:06.850
and I would be happy
to continue on my way

18:06.880 --> 18:10.210
if I only knew which way to go.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.740
In other words, you're lost?

18:14.920 --> 18:17.080
I'll point you home.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.390
I'd be much obliged.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.400
But I want a drink first.

18:21.430 --> 18:22.900
Wait... no!

18:22.930 --> 18:23.920
No!

18:23.960 --> 18:25.090
What?

18:25.130 --> 18:27.030
You don't want that water.

18:27.070 --> 18:28.260
Uh, it's poisoned.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.960
I saw you drink some.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.030
Well, now I'm feeling sick.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.970
You don't look ill.

18:34.010 --> 18:35.130
I'm dry as dust.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.300
I said, leave it alone!

18:38.350 --> 18:40.780
Let go of me! My father
will have you arrested!

18:40.810 --> 18:43.280
You're not going to go
and tell him, now, are you?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.780
Hey! Come back!

18:45.820 --> 18:47.480
Don't run away!

18:52.890 --> 18:54.790
Come back!

18:58.170 --> 18:59.930
Where you going so fast, Miss?

18:59.970 --> 19:02.090
Miles, wait!

19:02.200 --> 19:04.400
- No! No!
- You know what Tuck said, Jesse.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.630
- No exceptions.
- Help!

19:05.670 --> 19:07.330
You can't do this.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.610
Stop! Let go!

19:09.640 --> 19:10.610
We can't.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.950
Miles!

20:11.810 --> 20:14.570
Miss Foster!

20:18.210 --> 20:20.980
Miss Foster!

20:22.750 --> 20:26.580
Miss Foster!

20:26.620 --> 20:29.180
Where are you?!

20:44.870 --> 20:46.070
Ho.

20:47.540 --> 20:50.030
We're stopping here.

20:51.810 --> 20:53.750
Not a word out of you, hear me?

20:53.780 --> 20:55.770
Miles!

20:55.820 --> 20:57.410
- What are you doing?
- No!

20:57.450 --> 20:58.920
Let the poor girl go.

20:58.950 --> 21:01.480
There's no reason
to be frightened, young lady.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.850
I caught her at the spring
with Jesse.

21:04.890 --> 21:05.950
She's a Foster.

21:05.990 --> 21:08.660
Oh, Lord.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.130
It's finally happened.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.360
I want to go home, please.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.560
I want to go home.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.130
There, there, child.
Please don't cry.

21:16.170 --> 21:18.260
We're not bad people.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.030
We'll take you home
just as soon as we can.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.730
I promise.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.370
Miles, go find your father.

21:23.410 --> 21:24.780
He's across the lake.

21:24.810 --> 21:26.870
He'll know what to do with her.

21:26.910 --> 21:31.250
Tell Jesse I'm going to fix
that mouth of his.

21:52.410 --> 21:54.500
I've heard that.

21:54.540 --> 21:55.740
Have you?

21:55.780 --> 22:00.080
It's, it's my little music box.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.140
I found it
in the forest one day.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.510
Just waiting for me, I expect.

22:05.550 --> 22:09.110
I've had it a long, long time.

22:12.730 --> 22:14.920
Oh!

22:14.960 --> 22:18.130
I put my baby boys
to bed with it every night.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.570
Gave 'em such sweet dreams.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.640
I'm sure my boys
didn't mean you any harm.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.050
Then why did they bring me here
this way?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.280
Why am I here?

22:39.390 --> 22:42.410
You have every right
to be upset.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.120
And I know your family
must be...

22:44.160 --> 22:45.350
worried sick about you.

22:47.260 --> 22:49.660
Where's the child?

22:53.400 --> 22:57.030
She's no child... Angus.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.790
Does she know?

23:24.830 --> 23:26.060
Why do you think
I brought her...?

23:27.100 --> 23:29.160
Yeah, but now she knows
about us, thanks to you.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.170
Shh! Shh!

23:30.240 --> 23:31.600
She's a Foster,
she only knows...

23:31.640 --> 23:33.400
Know what?

23:41.420 --> 23:46.150
Miss Foster,
this is my husband, Angus Tuck.

23:46.190 --> 23:48.850
Angus, meet Miss Foster.

23:53.490 --> 23:55.930
Hello, Miss Foster.

24:00.770 --> 24:02.260
She's the most important event

24:02.300 --> 24:04.600
that's taken place in this house
in 80 years.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.770
You hungry?

24:12.810 --> 24:14.750
Oh, well, let's, let's all eat.

24:14.780 --> 24:15.940
Yeah.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.620
Jesse, pass your mother
a plate, please?

24:20.650 --> 24:22.050
Mmm, where's the fish?

24:22.090 --> 24:24.080
Oh, they weren't biting
for some reason.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.850
'Cause Pa can't fish?

24:25.890 --> 24:27.860
Don't matter. There's plenty.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.620
I catch fish.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.890
If there's no fish,
there's no fish

24:31.930 --> 24:34.130
if you keep scaring
the fish away.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.830
Mmm, this looks good.

24:36.870 --> 24:38.340
Oh! Isn't this nice?

24:38.370 --> 24:41.970
Everybody sitting down together
and having Miss Foster here.

24:42.010 --> 24:44.100
It's just like having a party.

24:46.010 --> 24:48.410
My father will come looking
for me.

24:48.450 --> 24:53.440
Your father... will cut down
the entire forest

24:53.490 --> 24:55.680
the way things are changing
around here.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.350
Make himself a very rich man.

24:57.390 --> 25:00.690
Oh, now, let's not ruin
a perfectly good meal

25:00.730 --> 25:02.130
with a lot of talk.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.460
My father has plenty of money.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.330
He'll pay.

25:06.370 --> 25:07.630
Anything you want.

25:07.670 --> 25:10.970
We don't want your father's
money, Miss Foster.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.700
Then let me go home.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.070
We will.

25:15.110 --> 25:18.440
We'll let you go home...
just like I promised.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.670
Directly.

25:19.710 --> 25:21.440
We'll need to be able
to trust her first

25:21.480 --> 25:24.350
before we're sending her
back to her folks.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.620
Trust her? We can't trust her.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.250
Or any normal people.

25:28.290 --> 25:30.550
She'll turn on us in a second.

25:30.590 --> 25:32.720
No, she won't.

25:33.930 --> 25:36.360
You're a fool.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.560
You don't even realize
what you've done here.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.680
Him.

26:23.710 --> 26:26.700
It's him.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.710
Robert!

26:28.750 --> 26:30.410
I expect you to find her, Henry.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.780
That's your job.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.150
I've already wired her
description down the main line.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.160
They'll keep a lookout

26:35.190 --> 26:37.160
and we'll get up a search party
come morning.

26:37.190 --> 26:39.520
My wife is certain that this man
wearing a yellow suit

26:39.560 --> 26:41.720
has something to do
with Winifred's disappearance.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.890
And Miss Foster says so
based on...?

26:45.100 --> 26:46.500
Her instincts.

26:46.530 --> 26:47.760
Hmm.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.240
Well, maybe you better step
in here, Mr. Foster.

26:59.980 --> 27:02.740
Am I whom you're looking for?

27:02.780 --> 27:04.840
I do believe I fit
the description.

27:06.450 --> 27:09.850
My wife said she saw you
talking to my daughter.

27:09.890 --> 27:11.020
Yes, I did.

27:11.060 --> 27:14.120
She's a charming girl,
full of fire.

27:14.230 --> 27:15.890
Perhaps too much.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.520
She's gone, is she?

27:18.570 --> 27:21.330
Looks like she... ran away.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.530
Did she now?

27:22.570 --> 27:24.000
Somehow I'm not surprised.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.670
My daughter did not... run away.

27:26.710 --> 27:29.440
And I'm not interested
in what surprises you, sir.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.880
I want to know
if you know anything

27:31.910 --> 27:32.880
of her whereabouts.

27:32.910 --> 27:33.880
No, Mr. Foster.

27:33.910 --> 27:35.710
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I do not.

27:35.750 --> 27:39.710
I am quite coincidentally here
in search of someone myself.

27:39.750 --> 27:40.880
I'm seeking a family

27:40.920 --> 27:42.550
that used to live
in these environs.

27:42.590 --> 27:43.950
I thought the constable could

27:43.990 --> 27:46.020
help me locate them,
but ironically, Mr. Foster

27:46.060 --> 27:48.790
your daughter thought
you could help.

27:50.030 --> 27:52.050
Name of Tuck.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.730
Long lost relatives.

27:53.770 --> 27:56.200
I-I can't help you.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.630
Nor I you.

28:01.810 --> 28:04.870
At least not now.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.440
However, I'd be happy

28:10.480 --> 28:12.470
to search your woods
for you, Mr. Foster.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.380
I'm rather talented
at finding people.

28:14.420 --> 28:15.980
I just might meet with success.

28:16.020 --> 28:17.280
Good evening, Constable.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.730
Find out what happened
to her, Henry.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.560
Please.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.900
She's our only child.

28:32.770 --> 28:35.040
Angus made that cradle.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.970
Brought it all the way
from Scotland.

28:37.010 --> 28:39.540
Oh, it's rocked a few Tucks.

28:39.580 --> 28:40.880
There you go.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.280
The breeze off the lake
will keep you cool all night.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.750
The boys sleep up in the loft
when they're home

28:46.790 --> 28:48.310
so you'll have your privacy.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.390
Oh, that corset looks painful.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.260
May I help you off with it?

29:05.170 --> 29:08.340
Oh, honestly, I can't understand

29:08.380 --> 29:10.570
why women torture themselves
this way.

29:10.610 --> 29:13.310
It's no way to live.

29:13.350 --> 29:15.340
Do you have a daughter?

29:16.850 --> 29:18.440
A granddaughter.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.080
And a grandson.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.780
Anna and Beau.

29:23.820 --> 29:26.660
Oh, Miles loved them so.

29:28.930 --> 29:31.120
What happened?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.600
They died.

29:32.630 --> 29:35.030
Their mother, too.

29:35.070 --> 29:37.660
I'm afraid the good parts
of Miles died along with them.

29:39.810 --> 29:42.440
You'll have to forgive
what's left of him.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.570
I'm sorry.

29:45.610 --> 29:49.100
Well, it's... it's the way
things are, Miss Foster.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.710
Can I call you Winnie?

29:56.290 --> 29:58.480
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

29:58.520 --> 30:01.150
No, it's only me.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.160
My mother...

30:09.300 --> 30:11.270
There.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.470
So where do they go?

30:13.510 --> 30:16.530
Oh, they go different places,
do different things.

30:16.580 --> 30:19.770
Miles can do carpentry
and he's good with his hands.

30:19.810 --> 30:22.540
Jesse, now, he seems
to have settled himself.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.070
Of course, then, he's...

30:24.120 --> 30:26.110
he's young yet.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.760
Well...

30:35.800 --> 30:37.920
I hope you will be
comfortable here.

30:40.500 --> 30:44.270
It's a good feeling
having another woman here.

30:46.810 --> 30:49.670
Try and get some sleep now.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.170
Hello?

31:16.600 --> 31:19.370
Have you lost your way, friend?

31:19.410 --> 31:21.810
Not hardly, Reverend.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.180
I'm looking
for a family name... Tuck.

31:26.280 --> 31:27.910
Are you familiar with it?

31:27.950 --> 31:30.180
Tuck. Tuck?

31:30.250 --> 31:32.180
I'm afraid I can't help you.

31:32.250 --> 31:34.580
There are no Tucks
in this cemetery that I know of.

31:34.620 --> 31:35.680
No, I wouldn't think so.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.690
Ha!

31:37.720 --> 31:39.350
Or in any other.

31:41.560 --> 31:42.690
Tell me, Reverend

31:42.730 --> 31:45.530
you who have attended
so many deathbeds...

31:45.570 --> 31:47.690
what is it people most desire

31:47.730 --> 31:50.900
as they face the end
of their lives?

31:50.940 --> 31:53.370
More time?

31:53.410 --> 31:54.530
Well, I suppose.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.440
Exactly.

31:56.480 --> 32:00.470
They'd give almost anything,
I imagine, for one more year.

32:00.510 --> 32:03.420
Imagine what they'd give
for all eternity.

32:03.450 --> 32:05.420
Sir, I don't quite understand
what...

32:05.450 --> 32:07.440
You will.

32:09.220 --> 32:13.130
Reverend, are you prepared
to die right now, this instant?

32:13.160 --> 32:14.520
If it's God's will.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.890
What if it is my will?

32:19.900 --> 32:22.490
What if you could be eternal?

32:22.540 --> 32:25.530
Right now, this instant?

32:25.570 --> 32:27.730
Without having to face
the uncertainty of death?

32:27.770 --> 32:28.930
Hmm?

32:28.980 --> 32:30.810
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

32:30.840 --> 32:32.070
No muss, no fuss.

32:32.110 --> 32:35.270
Invincible to disease.

32:35.310 --> 32:39.450
Never having to suffer
the stench and rot of old age.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.720
Forever young.

32:41.750 --> 32:46.780
You speak blasphemy, sir.

32:46.830 --> 32:49.350
Fluently.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.630
Good night, Reverend.

33:27.530 --> 33:31.370
Hey, Winnie Foster, you asleep?

33:35.610 --> 33:36.970
Not anymore.

33:37.010 --> 33:39.480
Good.

33:39.510 --> 33:42.280
Hey.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.280
Listen.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.380
How would you like
to see the Eiffel Tower?

33:48.420 --> 33:50.390
What?

33:50.420 --> 33:51.620
Someday.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.630
No, now.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.220
While the day is still ours.

34:02.370 --> 34:03.530
Get those dogs over there.

34:03.570 --> 34:04.700
Yes, sir.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.140
Come on, boys, let's go.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.800
Henry, this is
Winifred's nightgown.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.139
Give it to the dog handlers.

34:09.179 --> 34:10.230
Start in the north end.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.040
Let's split up
when we get to the lake.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.270
We'll find her.

34:13.310 --> 34:14.510
I know we will.

34:14.550 --> 34:15.980
Winifred!

34:16.020 --> 34:18.580
Miss Foster!

34:18.620 --> 34:19.780
Winnie!

34:19.820 --> 34:22.810
Winifred Foster!

34:22.860 --> 34:24.150
Miss Foster!

34:24.190 --> 34:26.320
Winifred!

34:30.530 --> 34:31.790
Over here!

34:31.830 --> 34:33.860
I found something!

34:50.449 --> 34:52.639
There it is.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.280
This is the Eiffel Tower?

34:56.460 --> 34:59.620
The one in Paris,
it's pretty tall.

34:59.660 --> 35:02.320
Mine's two feet higher.

35:08.070 --> 35:10.040
Here.

35:10.070 --> 35:12.660
Come on.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.770
Have you really seen
the real one in Paris?

35:14.810 --> 35:16.040
Yes, I have.

35:16.080 --> 35:19.140
And climbed 1,652 stairs
to the top.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.800
Much easier than this.

35:20.850 --> 35:21.970
Yes.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.140
You doing all right?

35:23.180 --> 35:24.310
I think so.

35:24.350 --> 35:25.480
You're doing great.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.420
Here.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.590
If I went to the Eiffel Tower

35:32.620 --> 35:34.150
I would take
one of those elevators.

35:34.190 --> 35:35.350
Not with me.

35:35.390 --> 35:36.760
You'd take off your shoes

35:36.800 --> 35:38.960
and walk up
every single solitary step.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.290
How old are you?

35:43.340 --> 35:46.170
Do you really want to know?

35:46.210 --> 35:49.970
Yes.

35:50.010 --> 35:51.440
104.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.570
I'm serious.

35:53.610 --> 35:56.380
So am I.

35:56.420 --> 35:59.210
Let's just call it 17.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.960
There's my Paris.

36:07.990 --> 36:13.460
The view from the Eiffel Tower
can't be better than this.

36:13.500 --> 36:20.170
I've seen a lot of views,
and this is one of the best.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.650
Come on.

38:05.250 --> 38:10.410
Winnie Foster was beginning
to lose track of time.

38:11.820 --> 38:17.220
Had she been there a day,
a week, a month?

38:20.790 --> 38:24.820
It seemed to Winnie
that the Tucks lived in a way

38:24.860 --> 38:27.590
the rest of the world
had forgotten.

38:29.170 --> 38:34.000
They were never in a hurry
and did things the slow way.

38:46.850 --> 38:49.150
For the first time

38:49.190 --> 38:55.790
Winnie felt free to explore,
to ask questions, to play.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.510
# #

39:22.990 --> 39:25.120
Me?

39:25.160 --> 39:27.960
I'm going to see the world.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.290
Every speck of it.

39:29.330 --> 39:33.860
Heck, I may even find some
new continents or something.

39:36.670 --> 39:40.130
I mean, I've been
to a lot of places

39:40.210 --> 39:44.200
but the world is huge!

39:47.380 --> 39:50.140
Jesse Tuck,
what-what are you doing?

39:50.180 --> 39:55.680
What does it look like?

40:03.130 --> 40:05.060
Woo-hoo!

40:08.700 --> 40:11.690
Woo! Ah, whoo.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.600
Come on!

40:17.640 --> 40:18.840
I can't!

40:18.880 --> 40:20.180
Why?

40:20.210 --> 40:22.510
You're not afraid of a little
cold water, are you?

40:22.550 --> 40:23.850
No.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.180
Are you afraid of me?

40:25.220 --> 40:26.980
No.

40:27.020 --> 40:28.920
Well, what then?

40:32.060 --> 40:33.850
I can't swim.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.860
You're joshing me.

40:35.890 --> 40:37.590
I wish I were.

40:37.630 --> 40:40.430
So, you're afraid you'll drown,
right?

40:40.470 --> 40:46.560
Swallow too much water,
sink to the bottom and die.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.700
Thank you for putting it
so vividly.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.210
And, yes,
considering I'd sink like a rock

40:51.240 --> 40:52.870
drowning is a fair concern.

40:52.910 --> 40:57.210
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to enjoy this

40:57.250 --> 40:59.880
all by myself.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.650
Hmm...

41:01.690 --> 41:03.120
Hmm!

41:22.870 --> 41:24.000
Ah, Jesse!

41:24.040 --> 41:25.010
Hey, hey, it's okay.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.670
Come here, come here, come here.

41:26.710 --> 41:29.010
I've got you, I've got you.

41:29.050 --> 41:31.180
I've got you, relax.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.680
Relax against me.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.840
You all right?

41:33.890 --> 41:36.010
I think so.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.850
Whoo!

41:37.890 --> 41:40.020
You did it!

41:40.060 --> 41:42.190
I did it!

41:42.230 --> 41:44.020
Ah, it feels wonderful.

41:44.060 --> 41:46.690
I'm weightless.

41:46.730 --> 41:49.030
That's 'cause we're
carrying you, see?

41:49.070 --> 41:51.540
The water and me.

41:51.570 --> 41:54.200
We're both carrying you.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.540
You like the feeling?

41:55.580 --> 41:57.910
I love it.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.980
Jesse, don't let go!

42:02.010 --> 42:04.310
It's okay, it's okay.

42:04.350 --> 42:06.980
There's no chance of that,
Winnie Foster.

42:07.020 --> 42:11.510
I'm never going to let you go.

42:28.110 --> 42:31.300
# #

42:44.760 --> 42:46.990
# #

43:32.540 --> 43:35.470
You know, I don't like
being laughed at by a cheat.

43:39.210 --> 43:41.300
Now "cheat" is a nasty word,
sir.

43:42.980 --> 43:46.140
I much prefer "card sharp."

43:59.430 --> 44:02.460
You are looking for trouble,
aren't you, mister?

44:02.500 --> 44:04.130
Yes, sir, I sure am.

44:04.170 --> 44:05.400
Going outside!

44:05.440 --> 44:06.410
Come on!

44:06.440 --> 44:07.800
Perhaps next time...

44:09.180 --> 44:10.160
Come on!

44:12.510 --> 44:15.570
He can't hurt me!

44:18.050 --> 44:20.140
Whoo!

44:27.360 --> 44:28.490
Thank you.

44:28.530 --> 44:31.860
Thank you very much.

44:38.870 --> 44:40.360
Excuse me, citizen.

44:58.390 --> 45:01.020
You hear that?

45:01.060 --> 45:03.460
Tuck says
it's the most melancholy sound

45:03.500 --> 45:05.120
in all of nature.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.130
Listen.

45:07.170 --> 45:09.790
Just listen.

45:16.710 --> 45:19.840
They're playing for you.

45:48.240 --> 45:53.270
# #

45:56.250 --> 45:57.440
Whoo! Yeah!

45:59.950 --> 46:03.440
# #

46:09.700 --> 46:13.790
# #

46:33.990 --> 46:37.080
# #

47:04.480 --> 47:09.110
I wish this moment
could last forever.

47:09.150 --> 47:12.780
Forever?

47:12.820 --> 47:15.120
You want to spend forever
with me, Winnie?

47:15.160 --> 47:18.490
I do.

47:21.830 --> 47:25.960
You know, we could see
the world together.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.960
We could do
everything together.

47:30.010 --> 47:33.470
Have a million moments
like this one that...

47:33.510 --> 47:36.350
never, never stop.

47:40.180 --> 47:44.990
There's a part about us
you don't know...

47:45.020 --> 47:48.320
the part I've sworn
not to tell you.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.990
The secret?

47:50.030 --> 47:54.400
The reason you don't want anyone
to find out about you?

47:54.430 --> 47:55.560
I knew it.

47:55.600 --> 47:59.560
You're... you're bank robbers
or grifters.

47:59.600 --> 48:02.100
You are the first human
I've ever met

48:02.140 --> 48:04.000
I wanted to know the truth.

48:04.540 --> 48:09.610
Jesse Tuck, you're the first
human I've ever met

48:09.650 --> 48:13.280
that I've ever wanted to...

48:13.320 --> 48:15.150
to...

48:18.320 --> 48:21.220
...to do that.

48:33.570 --> 48:36.560
Winnie, listen.

48:36.610 --> 48:37.840
Remember the giant oak tree

48:37.880 --> 48:39.670
at the center of the wood
where we met?

48:39.710 --> 48:45.650
The little spring bubbling up
you saw me drink from?

48:45.680 --> 48:49.120
You remember when I told you
I was 104 years old?

48:50.520 --> 48:52.080
Well...

48:52.120 --> 48:55.560
it's the honest truth.

49:02.100 --> 49:04.760
I'm going to live forever.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.570
I'm never going to change.

49:08.470 --> 49:10.440
The same with Miles
and Tuck and Mae.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.270
Something happened to us.

49:12.310 --> 49:15.250
As far as I know, I'm...
I'm going to be 17

49:15.280 --> 49:17.270
until the end of the world.

49:17.320 --> 49:20.380
It's the spring, Winnie.

49:20.420 --> 49:23.120
The water,
something's wrong with it.

49:23.190 --> 49:25.550
It stops you
right where you are.

49:25.590 --> 49:28.580
If you had a drink of it today,
you'd stay just like you are.

49:34.830 --> 49:38.960
Don't you wish he'd told you...

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
before you kissed him?

49:41.040 --> 49:43.060
Did he tell you

49:43.110 --> 49:46.040
immortality isn't all the
preachers crack it up to be?

49:46.080 --> 49:48.410
Hey, leave her alone, Miles.

49:48.450 --> 49:51.810
Oh, now... you want her
to hear it, Jesse boy.

49:51.850 --> 49:55.790
She's the first person
you want to tell the truth to.

49:55.820 --> 49:59.150
You just don't want me
to have what you lost.

49:59.190 --> 50:00.920
Stop this...

50:01.790 --> 50:04.490
...both of you

50:04.530 --> 50:06.330
and tell me the truth.

50:06.360 --> 50:07.630
I want to know.

50:13.870 --> 50:16.570
We all had a drink...

50:18.440 --> 50:22.880
...except for the cat...
that's important.

50:26.950 --> 50:31.010
The water tasted like...

50:31.060 --> 50:33.680
Heaven.

50:33.730 --> 50:36.820
Floated over your tongue
like a cloud.

50:38.830 --> 50:42.130
Tuck carved a "T" in the trunk,
to mark where we'd been.

50:42.170 --> 50:45.100
We moved on west, looking
for a place to settle down.

50:47.410 --> 50:49.340
Put up a house for Mae and Tuck

50:49.370 --> 50:52.600
and a little shed
for Jesse and me.

50:55.350 --> 51:01.150
That was the first time we
figured there was something...

51:02.520 --> 51:04.490
peculiar.

51:05.890 --> 51:09.590
Jesse fell 30 feet,
landed right on his neck.

51:11.130 --> 51:12.860
He was up on his feet again

51:12.900 --> 51:15.130
before Mae could work up
a good cry.

51:15.170 --> 51:18.400
Didn't hurt him a bit.
No broken bones... nothing.

51:20.470 --> 51:22.560
That's not all.

51:24.610 --> 51:27.370
Not by a long shot.

51:28.610 --> 51:31.140
Things began to happen.

51:31.180 --> 51:32.840
# #

51:32.880 --> 51:34.370
Some brushpoppers mistook

51:34.420 --> 51:37.120
Mae's horse for a deer.

51:37.220 --> 51:39.990
Thing is,
the bullets didn't kill him.

51:41.190 --> 51:44.490
Barely even left a mark.

51:44.530 --> 51:46.090
Then Tuck got bitten

51:46.130 --> 51:48.860
by a rattlesnake,
and you know what?

51:48.900 --> 51:50.700
He didn't die...

51:52.640 --> 51:54.630
...but the cat did

51:54.670 --> 51:56.830
of old age.

52:02.580 --> 52:04.770
# #

52:11.520 --> 52:13.580
And Miles got married.

52:15.690 --> 52:18.920
Daddy!

52:37.880 --> 52:39.210
Beau.

52:42.090 --> 52:45.150
Little Anna.

52:47.160 --> 52:49.060
Tuck figured it early on.

52:49.090 --> 52:52.030
It's the spring.

52:52.060 --> 52:56.400
We all drank from it,
even the horse.

52:58.740 --> 53:05.140
Had to be... the source
of our changelessness.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.950
I begged her to come back...
for me

53:13.980 --> 53:16.480
and find the spring
and drink from it.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.150
The children, too.

53:18.190 --> 53:20.780
It was our only hope
to be together.

53:33.570 --> 53:35.060
She made up her mind

53:35.110 --> 53:37.540
I'd sold my soul
to the Devil...

53:39.310 --> 53:41.300
...and she left me.

53:41.350 --> 53:44.310
She took my babies with her.

53:52.320 --> 53:55.760
Everyone...
pulled away after that.

53:55.790 --> 54:01.030
There was talk of witchcraft...
black magic.

54:17.110 --> 54:19.080
# #

54:23.020 --> 54:26.390
I went looking for wars
to fight...

54:26.420 --> 54:31.950
and I saw brave men die
at Vera Cruz...

54:32.000 --> 54:34.520
and then Gettysburg...

54:34.560 --> 54:38.900
thousands,
in the blink of an eye...

54:41.910 --> 54:45.210
...but not me.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.230
I couldn't die...

54:50.250 --> 54:51.770
...like little Anna.

54:54.820 --> 54:59.780
The influenza took her
before she's 15.

54:59.820 --> 55:01.720
And Beau.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.950
He'd be almost 80 now

55:03.990 --> 55:05.980
if he were still alive.

55:15.510 --> 55:17.060
And my sweet...

55:21.180 --> 55:24.080
...my sweet young bride.

55:27.180 --> 55:30.310
She died in an insane asylum...

55:32.290 --> 55:34.620
...old and alone.

55:37.290 --> 55:40.320
But I'm still here.

55:42.330 --> 55:43.630
I'm still here.

55:46.940 --> 55:48.930
# #

55:56.980 --> 55:58.970
# #

56:13.660 --> 56:15.660
# #

56:25.680 --> 56:27.670
# #

56:39.120 --> 56:42.580
Winnie Foster, you're the only
other person in the world

56:42.630 --> 56:44.620
who knows about us.

56:48.630 --> 56:50.430
We'll have to have a talk.

56:50.470 --> 56:51.930
Pa.

56:51.970 --> 56:53.630
Come on.

57:01.540 --> 57:03.540
# #

57:12.160 --> 57:15.520
# #

57:19.060 --> 57:21.220
Look around you.

57:24.370 --> 57:26.340
It's teeming life.

57:26.370 --> 57:29.670
It's flowers and trees
and frogs.

57:29.710 --> 57:33.270
It's... it's all part
of the wheel.

57:33.310 --> 57:36.280
It's always changing;
it's always growing

57:36.310 --> 57:37.780
like you, Winnie.

57:37.810 --> 57:42.050
Your life is never the same.

57:42.090 --> 57:46.390
You were once a child.

57:46.420 --> 57:50.090
Now, you are
about to become a woman.

57:50.190 --> 57:51.790
One day, you'll grow up

57:51.830 --> 57:54.090
and you'll do
something important.

57:54.200 --> 57:57.330
You'll have children,
maybe, and then one day

57:57.370 --> 58:00.670
you'll go out...

58:00.710 --> 58:02.670
just like the flame of a candle.

58:02.710 --> 58:04.540
You'll make way for new life.

58:04.580 --> 58:05.870
That's a certainty.

58:05.910 --> 58:08.780
That's the natural way
of things.

58:08.810 --> 58:10.710
And then, there's us.

58:10.750 --> 58:14.710
What we Tucks have,
you can't call it living.

58:14.750 --> 58:17.720
We just... are.

58:17.750 --> 58:21.750
We're like rocks,
stuck at the side of a stream.

58:23.660 --> 58:24.650
Listen to me.

58:24.700 --> 58:27.430
Winnie, you know
a dangerous secret.

58:27.460 --> 58:28.960
If people find out
about the spring

58:29.000 --> 58:30.520
they'll trample
all over each other

58:30.570 --> 58:31.540
to get to that water.

58:31.570 --> 58:34.440
There's one thing I've learned
about people.

58:34.470 --> 58:37.370
Many will do anything,
anything not to die

58:37.410 --> 58:41.040
and they'll do anything
to keep from living their life.

58:41.080 --> 58:45.850
Do you want
to stay stuck as you are

58:45.880 --> 58:48.870
right now, forever?

58:51.890 --> 58:54.760
I've just got
to make you understand.

58:56.760 --> 58:58.850
I don't want to die.
Is that wrong?

58:58.900 --> 59:01.190
No.

59:01.230 --> 59:04.860
No human does...

59:04.900 --> 59:08.200
but i-it's part of the wheel...

59:08.240 --> 59:11.000
the same as being born.

59:11.040 --> 59:15.270
You can't have living
without dying.

59:15.310 --> 59:19.480
Don't be afraid of death,
Winnie.

59:19.520 --> 59:23.510
Be afraid of the unlived life.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.490
# #

59:37.130 --> 59:39.120
# #

59:47.450 --> 59:50.810
# #

59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.680
Your tea, sir.

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:11.500
She's with them now.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.500
I came directly here,

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.830
knowing how tormented
you must be.

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:17.840
We-we just want her back safely.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.270
Course you do.

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.610
Dreadful business, kidnapping.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.610
Fortunate I was witness.

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:27.620
I'm perhaps the only person...

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.640
who knows where to find her.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:36.820
Just what is your game, sir?

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.520
What is my game?

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:42.460
You detect in me a playful mood?

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.200
"Playful" is not
the word I had in mind.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.960
What I have in mind
is a simple, clear-cut trade.

01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:53.570
You see,
I very much like your woods

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:57.640
not for their timber, mind you

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.510
but for their natural assets.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.580
Wh-What is it you want?

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.590
You want your daughter.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.460
I want your woods.

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:13.430
You're involved in this,
aren't you?

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.990
If you have touched
my daughter...!

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.700
I have my faults, Mr. Foster.

01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:20.860
Kidnapping is not amongst them.

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:25.740
These are rough people,
the ones who took her.

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:27.710
No telling what they might do.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:35.840
Unless we do what you say.

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:38.880
Give the man whatever he wants.

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:51.300
Done and done.

01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:54.500
Nice to have things legal
and tidy, don't you agree?

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.600
You're an intelligent,
reasonable man, Mr. Foster.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.160
I'm seldom wrong
as a judge of character.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.370
Have your friendly constable
on hand

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.380
to make
the appropriate arrests.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.980
Your terrible ordeal is
as good as over.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.710
I'll get there before you.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:12.520
We have to move quickly.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.610
They were packing to leave.

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:20.720
What kind of horrible people
must these kidnappers be?

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.390
There is evil in the world,
Mr. Foster.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.160
There aren't fences high enough
to keep it out.

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:28.760
Bring your men
directly to my house.

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:30.140
I'm going with you.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.170
# #

01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:46.380
# #

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:58.290
It isn't fair, Tuck.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:02:59.800
No, it isn't...

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.500
but when has life
ever been fair?

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:09.500
How am I going to take you home

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.510
when I can't make my feet move
from this spot?

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.850
If I could die tomorrow,
I'd do it...

01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:20.650
just to spend one more night
with you.

01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:23.450
Forgive me for interrupting
such a tender moment.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.730
Hello, Winifred.

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:34.670
Everyone's been so worried
about you.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.500
I'm relieved
to find you so well.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.230
You know this man?

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:40.770
I met him once.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.680
Hello, Mr. Tuck.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.390
You have no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.990
You're the man
who's been following my boys.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.430
Been expecting you.

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:10.440
Yes, and here I am.

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:14.370
Tell me, is it a relief...
to finally be discovered?

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:19.040
Over a century of hiding out
must have taken its toll on you.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.740
Who are you?

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:25.120
And how do you know so much
about us?

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:29.420
I first heard about your family
from my grandmother.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.450
She knew a woman
in a mental facility

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.190
who used to...
rant and ramble about a family

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:39.000
who never grew old
and never died.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.300
This woman,
she used to call out a name.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.960
What was it, now?

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:45.300
Anna.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.930
Crazy old woman.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.380
Kept on talking
about a music box.

01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:54.010
It seems the melody had a
calming effect on her children.

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:56.110
I'm sure you know it, Mrs. Tuck?

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.660
You have no right...

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:15.260
to come to our home...
and bring us such pain.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.790
There, good mother.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.870
I mean no harm.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.640
Tell us, sir.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.980
What is it you want?

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:32.150
Well, you see, the Fosters
have given me these woods

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:34.520
in exchange
for bringing young Winifred

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.650
back home to them.

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:38.090
I have the papers,
all signed and legal.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.100
Gives me the rights
to the forest

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.490
and everything in it.

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:42.830
Don't be alarmed.

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:45.830
I'll let you stay here...
on my land

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:48.000
if you prove cooperative.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.100
Cooperative?

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.800
I want you to take me
to the spring.

01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:59.040
I don't know what you mean.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.740
Don't insult me, Mr. Tuck.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.610
It's immediately clear to me

01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.620
that the water's powers
have been wasted on...

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.620
unimaginative people like you.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.620
I intend to make

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.680
this fountain of youth,
as the simpletons would call it

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:14.720
available to those
who deserve it...

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.730
for a price, of course.

01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:22.330
You'll die of old age
before I'll take you.

01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:23.800
Is that so?

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.360
Then, perhaps Winifred will!

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:26.340
No!

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.700
Jesse!

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:39.890
# #

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:47.920
Yes!

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.960
Bravo!

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.600
Come now, Winifred.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.730
I'm feeling thirsty.

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:00.330
Show me where the spring is.

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.430
Perhaps I'll let you have
a drink.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.970
After all...

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.020
...then we can spend...
eternity together.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.800
Winnie, Winnie, come here.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.100
It's okay. It's okay, I gotcha.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.580
Pa.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.270
There they are!

01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:04.210
Winnie Foster!

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.640
I see her!

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.580
I got her!

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:09.810
Circle around to the right!

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:10.810
Watch the water!

01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:11.900
Go!

01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:12.970
Don't let anyone get away!

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.450
Jesse, come on.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.450
Winnie!

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.470
Block that trail!

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.490
It's my father.

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.689
Keep them alive!

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:25.960
Be careful of the girl!
Winnie!

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.660
Let's go!

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:31.569
Wait...

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:35.939
Get on.

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:37.670
Behind the house, men!

01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:40.370
He's setting the house on fire!

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:42.040
Winnie!

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.069
You're all right.
You're all right.

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:46.939
We found you. You're safe.

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:48.080
You're safe now.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.710
Everything's all right.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.720
Winnie.

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:53.240
Hyah!

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.670
# #

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:26.120
The hall clock chimed the hour.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.779
Outside, the wind was still.

01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:33.120
Everything, it seemed,
was waiting.

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:14.260
We just want to understand
what happened.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.670
Winnie... try, please.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:28.520
They didn't kidnap me.

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:31.180
I was with them
because I wanted to be.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:33.590
She doesn't know

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.250
what she's saying.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:37.620
The Tucks were kind to me.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.630
They're my friends.

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:41.560
If they didn't kidnap you,
why on earth

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.430
did that woman club that man
over the head with a shotgun?

01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:46.730
Because Mae Tuck
was protecting me.

01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:48.460
Doesn't matter anyway.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.270
That fella died.
It's a murder charge now.

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:53.000
I didn't much like the man

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.240
but that won't stop
that poor woman from hanging.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.440
Miss is an eyewitness.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.780
She'll have to testify.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.340
Oh, my God.

01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:11.390
I figured you might want this.

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:14.160
Doesn't exist,
far as I'm concerned.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.330
I sure am sorry about all this.

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:19.330
Good day.

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:21.030
Thank you, Henry.

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:27.870
# #

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:57.560
Winnie.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.810
Jesse!

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.340
Oh, it's you.

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.040
I was afraid
I would never see you again.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.570
I need you to help me.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.250
I need you to help us.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:13.910
Mae can't go to the gallows.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.580
She won't die.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.650
She can't die.

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:21.290
They're going to find out
our secret.

01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:23.760
We have to get them out.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.450
Help me!

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.450
Please, help me!

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:45.450
Somebody, help me!

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:47.350
Please, someone help!

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:49.460
Please! Help!

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:50.620
All right.

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.290
Help me, please!

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:53.380
All right!

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:54.390
Help!

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:56.450
PI... Please!

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.360
Help me! You have to stop them!

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.420
They're after me!

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:01.730
Miss F... Miss Fo...
Who's after you?

01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:02.830
The people who kidnapped me!

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:04.240
They're going
to take me away again!

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:05.430
My parents couldn't stop them!

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:07.100
They're right outside!

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.410
You have to stop them, please!

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.410
Help!

01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:12.040
They'll kill me if they find me!

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.100
Please, they're going
to kill me, please!

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:15.270
Stay right there!

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.480
I'll handle this.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.810
Hurry!

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:22.080
Help!

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:27.090
# #

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:40.110
Come out and meet your doom!

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.840
Hell is upon you!

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:49.180
Stop right there!

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:52.810
You're under arrest!

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.110
# #

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.680
Come on, we have to hurry.

01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:00.960
The boys are outside.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.620
Stay back, now!

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.000
I'll shoot!

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.910
# #

01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:57.820
My dear, sweet Winnie.

01:14:57.850 --> 01:15:00.720
What I wouldn't do to keep you.

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:07.890
I wish you were ours...
for Jesse.

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:11.230
For all of us.

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:15.130
You have to hurry
and get away from here.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.870
Winnie...

01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:19.900
Winnie, come with me.

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.130
There's nothing for you here.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:22.370
We can be together forever.

01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:25.400
If she comes with us,
they'll hunt us down.

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:27.380
They'll never stop looking.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.470
Tuck is right.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.780
If I go with you

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.790
it'll be too dangerous
for all of you.

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.190
I can't go without you.

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:47.560
You have to.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.470
Go back to the spring.

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:55.100
Drink from it.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.480
When it's safe...
I'll come back for you.

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:00.100
Will you?

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:02.480
I have to show you
the Eiffel Tower, don't I?

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.950
1,652 steps to the top.

01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:08.290
Winnie...

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.220
until we're together again...

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.490
wake up with the dawn.

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:16.260
I will.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.390
We got to go...
before it's too late.

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:34.540
Winnie Foster...

01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:38.640
I will love you
till the day I die!

01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:49.220
# #

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.230
# #

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.630
She's going fast

01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:30.330
but you can have a couple
of minutes with her.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.640
How are you?

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:14.410
"...and to Almighty God

01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:17.380
"we commend the soul
of our sister

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:20.750
"and we commit her body
to the ground.

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:27.750
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust..."

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:32.400
"...Resurrection
into eternal life

01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:34.530
"through our Lord Jesus Christ;

01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:38.300
"at whose coming in glorious
Majesty to judge the World

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.570
"the Earth and the Sea
shall give up their Dead;

01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:45.170
"and the corruptible bodies
of those who sleep in him

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:49.240
"shall be changed, and made like
unto his own glorious Body;

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.740
"according to the mighty working
whereby he is able

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:55.760
to subdue
all things unto himself."

01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:57.780
# #

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.790
Mother?

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:13.770
I was just wondering

01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:16.800
what it is about these woods
you love so much.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.980
Mother, are you all right?

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:36.630
I'm going to miss her, too.

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:40.630
Oh...

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:44.630
Every time I look at you,
you're different.

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.000
I'm losing you, too.

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:01.850
I'm right here.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.950
Forgive me, Winnie.

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:14.160
I just wanted to keep you
my little girl forever.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.130
# #

01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:34.780
# #

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.670
Go back to the spring.

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:52.470
When it's safe,
I'll come back for you.

01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:02.810
What we Tucks have,
you can't call it living.

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:06.150
We just... are.

01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:11.350
We're like rocks stuck
at the side of a stream.

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:32.700
The first weeks of summer
were long over.

01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:36.780
There was a feeling

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.150
that the wheel
was turning again...

01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:44.480
...slowly now,
but soon to go faster.

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:55.160
Winnie and her family
left Treegap to see the world.

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.130
She wasn't certain
what herjourney might bring

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.150
but this much she knew...

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:10.840
it would be something
of her own choosing.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.680
# #

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.690
# #

01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:43.640
# #

01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:55.590
For some, time passes slowly.

01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:59.720
An hour can seem an eternity.

01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:04.470
For others,
there's never enough.

01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:08.940
For Jesse Tuck,
it didn't exist.

01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:31.150
Tuck said it to Winnie
the summer she turned 15:

01:24:31.190 --> 01:24:36.420
Do not fear death,
but rather the unlived life.

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:39.520
You don't have to live forever.

01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:41.760
You just have to live.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.130
And she did.
