WEBVTT

00:05.274 --> 00:09.938
Wonderful, Hannah! Brilliant!
Oh, you look gorgeous! Radiant!

00:10.112 --> 00:12.979
<i>This is the life</i>
<i>Hold on tight</i>

00:13.048 --> 00:14.037
Yeah!

00:14.149 --> 00:16.174
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:17.553 --> 00:19.783
<i>Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha!</i>

00:19.855 --> 00:21.220
<i>This is the life... </i>

00:21.290 --> 00:23.224
Oh! Wait, stop. Stop, stop.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.927
Hannah, darling, we're doing an ad
for skin cream, not wart removal!

00:27.996 --> 00:31.454
- What is that face?
- I believe it's a reaction to your singing.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.365
- And you are?
- Hannah's manager.

00:34.436 --> 00:37.132
Well, "Hannah's manager,"
I'm an award-winning photographer,

00:37.206 --> 00:41.404
so why don't you just
push your tush off my set?

00:41.476 --> 00:42.875
And I'm also her father.

00:42.945 --> 00:45.175
Oh, I need a chair
for Mr. Montana's tush!

00:46.915 --> 00:48.644
Ah, there you go. Comfy?

00:48.717 --> 00:51.777
- Like a monkey in a banana bath.
- How charming!

00:54.289 --> 00:55.779
Okay.

00:55.858 --> 00:59.191
Hannah, darling,
Magic Glow Skin Cream,

00:59.261 --> 01:03.061
everyone's favorite zit-zapper,
is using this billboard to launch

01:03.131 --> 01:08.125
a worldwide campaign, okay?
So give me jubilance peppered with

01:08.203 --> 01:13.140
rapture and sprinkled with
just a dash of <i>je ne sais quoi. </i>

01:13.475 --> 01:16.706
No, no, no, that's not even close.

01:17.946 --> 01:19.880
How about, "Say cheese?"

01:19.948 --> 01:23.384
- I need some cheese for Mr. Montana!
- Nice spread, Son.

01:23.952 --> 01:27.479
You need to slow it down a little bit.
What I'm saying is

01:27.556 --> 01:30.252
if you just keep it simple,
you'll get more out of her.

01:30.325 --> 01:33.385
Yes, Mr. Montana, anything you say.

01:34.730 --> 01:37.824
Just what I need,
Jethro's chicken fried wisdom.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.558
Ah!

01:39.635 --> 01:43.867
All right, Hannah, say, "Cheese!"

01:43.939 --> 01:46.305
Oh, okay. All right. Good.

01:46.375 --> 01:50.277
Okay. Yes! Good. You're getting there.

01:50.345 --> 01:55.214
Yes. Oh, fabulous. Oh, yes, fabulous!

01:55.751 --> 01:57.446
Perfection!

01:57.519 --> 02:00.647
Perfection! I've done it again!

02:15.971 --> 02:19.498

<i>Who would have thought</i>

02:31.620 --> 02:35.920
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:37.292 --> 02:40.887
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:40.963 --> 02:42.931
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:42.998 --> 02:44.693
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:44.766 --> 02:49.066
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:49.137 --> 02:50.866
<i>Mix it all together</i>

02:50.939 --> 02:53.999
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:04.152 --> 03:06.017
- Miley!
- Oliver!

03:06.088 --> 03:08.522
For the winning shot...

03:11.393 --> 03:14.556
- Come on, Lilly, flagrant foul!
- Oops. My bad.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.726
Here you go.

03:21.203 --> 03:23.103
Nice hands, Shaq.

03:24.573 --> 03:27.337
- Why don't you have your contacts in?
- My dog ate them,

03:27.409 --> 03:32.403
along with an entire tube of toothpaste.
He's been doing this all morning.

03:32.481 --> 03:34.005
Lilly, how are you gonna
get a sneak peek

03:34.082 --> 03:36.676
at my Magic Glow billboard tonight
if you can't even see?

03:36.752 --> 03:40.449
I'll just imagine your head really big
with pigeons on it.

03:41.123 --> 03:44.354
I know, you're giving me a look,
I just can't see it.

03:44.426 --> 03:47.987
- Don't you have backup glasses?
- Oh, you mean these?

03:49.965 --> 03:54.561
Wowee! Look at those styling specs!

03:55.070 --> 03:56.332
Nice try.

03:56.405 --> 04:00.501
Never let your mother buy you glasses
at a place that also sells tires.

04:02.411 --> 04:05.346
- Hey, Truscott!
- Yeah! Who's that?

04:05.414 --> 04:06.403
Heather.

04:09.918 --> 04:13.547
Okay. Give them attitude. More 'tude!

04:13.622 --> 04:15.886
Congrats on making
the half pipe finals.

04:15.957 --> 04:18.050
- I'm so sorry.
- About what?

04:18.125 --> 04:20.286
Sorry I'm gonna beat you. Again.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.089
- Beat you again!
- You've got no chance.

04:22.164 --> 04:23.188
No chance!

04:23.265 --> 04:25.199
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

04:25.834 --> 04:26.823
Oh.

04:28.370 --> 04:30.497
Let me tell you something, Heather.

04:30.572 --> 04:32.403
No. Let me.

04:32.474 --> 04:36.934
Hold up, slick,
no one talks to my girl like that.

04:37.045 --> 04:38.740
- Ow.
- Sorry.

04:38.814 --> 04:41.305
Saturday night in the finals,
you're going down!

04:41.383 --> 04:44.250
You may have beaten Lilly last year,
and the year before that,

04:44.319 --> 04:46.082
and the year before that...

04:47.456 --> 04:49.219
I think she gets it.

04:49.691 --> 04:51.852
You're the one who's gonna get it bad.

04:51.927 --> 04:53.895
Get it bad!

04:54.663 --> 04:56.824
- Too much?
- You think?

04:58.700 --> 05:02.796
You know what? You may be the
champion now, but after Saturday,

05:02.871 --> 05:05.066
you're gonna be the chumpion!

05:05.140 --> 05:06.539
High five.

05:11.813 --> 05:14.714
Just answer your phone
before you hurt anybody else.

05:16.351 --> 05:18.819
Hello. Hey, Mom.

05:18.887 --> 05:20.752
What? But they said...

05:22.491 --> 05:24.015
Okay, fine.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.989
My contacts aren't coming
till next week.

05:27.062 --> 05:30.896
Oh, so what? You can just wear your
glasses to the skate finals. Who cares?

05:30.966 --> 05:34.527
I do. No way I'm gonna compete
if I have to wear these.

05:34.603 --> 05:36.093
Are you kidding me?

05:36.171 --> 05:39.607
All you've been talking about is
double kickflipping Heather

05:39.674 --> 05:41.232
all across the skate park.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.607
That was with two eyes, not four.

05:44.346 --> 05:45.745
Over here.

05:46.248 --> 05:49.581
I am not going in front
of all those people looking like this.

05:49.651 --> 05:51.676
Lilly, will you please forget
about how you look?

05:51.753 --> 05:53.311
It's what's on the inside that counts.

05:53.388 --> 05:56.915
Easy for you to say.
You're the poster child for perfect skin!

05:57.125 --> 05:59.252
This isn't about me.

05:59.528 --> 06:01.496
Or my perfect skin.

06:02.164 --> 06:04.359
Oliver!

06:04.432 --> 06:07.196
Please tell Lilly that looks don't matter.

06:07.269 --> 06:09.635
Okay. Looks don't matter.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.874
See? If Oliver can say it
with his freaky nostril thing,

06:13.942 --> 06:17.400
- you can get over your glasses.
- Yeah.

06:17.479 --> 06:18.673
What?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.144
Oh, you know, how one is way bigger
than the other?

06:21.216 --> 06:23.980
You don't see him obsessing about it.

06:27.889 --> 06:29.880
Oh, my gosh.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.119
Look at me! Look!

06:32.761 --> 06:35.355
I am a lopsided freak!

06:35.430 --> 06:37.421
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

06:40.402 --> 06:44.133
Stop staring at me! I'm not an animal!

07:00.789 --> 07:01.778
Jackson.

07:02.624 --> 07:05.684
There's something wrong with that boy.

07:05.760 --> 07:10.197
Why? Why? Why me, Dad? Why me?

07:10.265 --> 07:12.460
I was just asking myself
that same question

07:12.534 --> 07:15.230
not five seconds ago
when I unloaded these.

07:16.304 --> 07:18.772
Whoa, it worked! They are whiter.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.967
And lemon fresh!

07:23.912 --> 07:28.542
On the bright side, I'm just glad to see
you're wearing clean underwear again.

07:28.617 --> 07:31.484
- So, how'd the date go, Son?
- I still can't believe it.

07:31.553 --> 07:33.953
I finally got Melissa to go out with me,

07:34.022 --> 07:36.855
we're cruising down the coast highway,

07:36.925 --> 07:40.452
and I do that yawn thing, where I
get my arm all the way around her.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.586
And then...

07:44.899 --> 07:48.027
I can see where
that would have been embarrassing.

07:48.136 --> 07:50.536
But at least you were in a convertible.

07:50.605 --> 07:52.505
Dad, it wasn't me, it was the car!

07:52.574 --> 07:55.168
I didn't have enough money
so I ran out of gas.

07:55.243 --> 07:57.541
- It was humiliating.
- Don't sweat it, Son.

07:57.612 --> 07:59.204
I'm sure your friend understood.

07:59.281 --> 08:01.943
It's not like you made her get out
and push.

08:06.021 --> 08:10.390
This has been the worst date
of my entire life!

08:11.393 --> 08:14.362
Well, maybe a little kiss
will make it better?

08:19.034 --> 08:20.865
Somebody had to steer.

08:30.078 --> 08:32.409
- Hello, Jackson.
- Hello, Rico.

08:33.181 --> 08:38.118
So, your boss, the man I call "Daddy,"
tells me you asked him for a raise.

08:38.186 --> 08:42.179
Yeah, I did. Girls like cars,
cars like gas, and gas costs money.

08:43.091 --> 08:44.217
What's it to you?

08:44.292 --> 08:47.591
Well, Daddy still hasn't
made up his mind.

08:47.662 --> 08:51.462
Could go either way.
If only you had someone,

08:52.667 --> 08:55.329
someone... Someone on the inside.

08:56.071 --> 08:58.164
Someone who knows
how to pull on his heartstrings

08:58.239 --> 09:00.969
and make him dance
like a little puppet.

09:01.943 --> 09:03.774
What do you want, Rico?

09:07.582 --> 09:11.245
And now,
the Great Ricolini will perform

09:11.319 --> 09:14.186
the legendary disappearing egg trick,

09:14.255 --> 09:16.450
with the help of my charming assistant,

09:16.524 --> 09:19.015
the lovely Tina.

09:28.970 --> 09:31.234
She should have shaved her legs.

09:33.274 --> 09:35.538
But isn't she wonderful?

09:36.144 --> 09:38.874
Here, O Great Ricolini,
the magical egg.

09:40.115 --> 09:42.310
Please, no flash photography.

09:42.384 --> 09:44.113
Isn't she wonderful?

09:53.294 --> 09:57.663
I hold in my hand what looks to be
an ordinary egg. But is it?

09:58.199 --> 10:00.599
One, two, and...

10:02.337 --> 10:04.271
Yes, it is.

10:06.608 --> 10:08.940
And I thank you.

10:19.988 --> 10:23.788
Lilly, there's no one up here.
This is really getting stupid.

10:25.026 --> 10:29.520
We passed stupid on the third floor.
Now we're up to sports hernia.

10:30.031 --> 10:31.623
Okay, fine.

10:34.235 --> 10:37.727
- Whoa! This is so cool!
- Wait till you see the billboard.

10:37.806 --> 10:39.706
Not before the drum roll.

10:47.849 --> 10:48.873
What?

10:48.950 --> 10:50.815
You know,
they really don't look that bad.

10:50.885 --> 10:53.115
If it helps, I think they're pretty cool.

10:53.188 --> 10:56.089
- Aw, man!
- What'd I say?

10:56.157 --> 10:58.955
Dad, when a parent says
something's cool, you know it's dorky.

10:59.027 --> 11:00.722
Okay, I get it.

11:00.795 --> 11:04.196
Lilly, I think those glasses
are a big bowl of ugly.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.263
Thanks a lot!

11:09.170 --> 11:12.469
"Big bowl of ugly"? Work with me here.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.509
Oh, well, enough chitchat.

11:15.577 --> 11:18.375
How 'bout we unveil this masterpiece?

11:18.546 --> 11:22.175
Yeah. And, Lilly, when you
beat Heather in the skate finals,

11:22.250 --> 11:24.514
no one's gonna be
looking at your glasses.

11:24.586 --> 11:27.316
They're gonna be looking at
the big trophy in your hand.

11:27.388 --> 11:30.448
Well... It is big, isn't it?

11:30.525 --> 11:35.053
Oh, yeah. And if it were me,
I wouldn't let glasses or anything

11:35.129 --> 11:37.996
stop me from going after
what I really wanted.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.497
Really?

11:39.567 --> 11:42.661
Well, what if you had

11:42.737 --> 11:45.672
a zit the size of a tomato?

11:45.740 --> 11:48.004
Lilly, come on.
Now you're just being ridiculous.

11:48.076 --> 11:50.567
Oh, yeah? Turn around.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.673
Daddy! Who put my face on that zit?

12:08.563 --> 12:10.997
- No, ma'am. No way.
- No, ma'am. No way!

12:11.065 --> 12:12.532
We never agreed
to something like this.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.033
No, we did not!

12:14.335 --> 12:17.133
I know, but I had an inspiration.

12:17.205 --> 12:22.165
If Hannah Montana says,
"Even I get zits," she should have a zit.

12:22.310 --> 12:25.074
It was staring me right in the face.

12:25.146 --> 12:28.638
Yeah, well, now it's staring
all of Los Angeles right in the face.

12:28.716 --> 12:31.617
- And we don't like it.
- No, we do not!

12:33.288 --> 12:35.813
I hear your concerns. There's nothing
more important to me right now

12:35.890 --> 12:38.017
than your feelings. Be right back.

12:39.694 --> 12:43.755
I need more emotion!
You're strong, you're fearless!

12:43.831 --> 12:46.425
You're a superhero saving the world.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.032
Give me something.

12:52.907 --> 12:55.239
I can't work with this!

12:57.545 --> 13:01.777
Not so easy when it's your face
that has the problem.

13:04.519 --> 13:06.680
I don't have a problem.

13:07.288 --> 13:09.153
Why should I have a problem?

13:09.223 --> 13:10.986
After all, looks don't matter.

13:11.059 --> 13:14.051
And if that's the way they want to go
with this worldwide campaign,

13:14.128 --> 13:15.618
I'm fine with it.

13:15.697 --> 13:17.756
Sorry, Mile, but this is the way

13:17.832 --> 13:19.595
they wanna go
with the worldwide campaign.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.656
What?

13:21.302 --> 13:24.499
I mean, really?

13:24.572 --> 13:25.732
Great.

13:25.807 --> 13:28.742
Awesome. Terrific.

13:28.810 --> 13:30.903
I love it!

13:30.979 --> 13:32.003
You do?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.479
Yes, I do.

13:33.548 --> 13:36.517
I mean, after all, looks don't matter.

13:36.584 --> 13:38.950
I don't just talk the talk,

13:39.020 --> 13:41.454
I walk the walk.

13:41.522 --> 13:43.387
You are amazing.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.985
I mean, if you can stand up
in front of the whole world

13:47.061 --> 13:49.859
with that ginormous zit,

13:49.931 --> 13:53.162
something any normal person
would be humiliated by...

13:53.234 --> 13:56.567
Lilly. Please. Get to the point.

13:57.538 --> 14:00.564
The point is that, if you can do all that,

14:00.642 --> 14:04.271
then I can wear my glasses
to the skate competition.

14:04.979 --> 14:07.573
Thank you so much.

14:07.649 --> 14:10.550
This is the greatest thing
you've ever done for me.

14:10.618 --> 14:14.987
I am gonna double kickflip Heather
all over that skate park!

14:15.990 --> 14:17.355
Thanks to you.

14:19.994 --> 14:22.462
I'm so proud of you, Mile.

14:22.530 --> 14:23.519
Thanks.

14:24.732 --> 14:27.758
Daddy, we have got to get rid
of that zit!

14:28.169 --> 14:29.864
What happened to,
"Looks don't matter"?

14:29.937 --> 14:31.871
What happened to,
"Don't worry, I'll fix it"?

14:31.939 --> 14:33.770
I tried, bud.

14:33.841 --> 14:35.706
"I tried, bud. "

14:44.952 --> 14:46.579
Hey, Dad.

14:46.654 --> 14:48.986
Well, you move the family
to Hollywood,

14:49.057 --> 14:51.525
and this is what you get.

14:56.831 --> 14:59.527
Come on, Jackson,
we gotta do this quick.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.465
Sorry, I need my cash up front.

15:01.536 --> 15:03.367
I've got one kid
yanking my chain already.

15:03.438 --> 15:06.566
- I don't need another one.
- Fine.

15:07.442 --> 15:09.672
Half now and half when the job's done.

15:09.744 --> 15:11.006
Done.

15:11.079 --> 15:12.171
Okay.

15:13.047 --> 15:14.947
Let's cover this goober.

15:16.584 --> 15:19.644
Wait. I got a better idea.

15:21.322 --> 15:23.415
It's not ready yet.

15:24.325 --> 15:26.225
Just hold the paint.

15:26.294 --> 15:29.092
Hey, Miles, what are you gonna
tell Lilly at the big unveiling

15:29.163 --> 15:30.596
when she sees that the zit's gone?

15:30.665 --> 15:32.792
Not a problem.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.664
She'll be at the skateboard competition.

15:34.736 --> 15:37.296
By the time she sees the billboard,
she'll have her trophy

15:37.371 --> 15:38.929
and I'll have my face back,

15:39.006 --> 15:42.407
just like that.

15:45.646 --> 15:47.580
Nice work.
- Thanks.

15:47.648 --> 15:50.742
You know, sometimes the voice
in my head sounds just like Dad.

15:50.818 --> 15:52.945
There's a reason for that.

15:55.456 --> 15:57.287
Oh, man. Busted.

15:57.959 --> 16:01.395
So who's the mastermind
behind this operation?

16:01.963 --> 16:03.191
Okay...

16:03.631 --> 16:05.622
- Jackson made me do it.
- What?

16:07.034 --> 16:10.197
Dad, why do you have a paint brush?

16:12.607 --> 16:15.906
- Jackson made me do it.
- And I repeat, what?

16:17.311 --> 16:21.941
Mile, you know I'll always be there
for you. You're my little girl.

16:22.150 --> 16:24.345
Wait, what am I?

16:24.418 --> 16:26.716
Tina. My other little girl.

16:35.997 --> 16:40.058
So, Rico, check this out.
Your little magic act inspired me.

16:43.938 --> 16:46.406
Keep your eye on the ball.

16:48.142 --> 16:49.973
Round and round they go.

16:50.044 --> 16:53.639
Watch the amazing works
of the magnificent Jacksolini.

16:54.415 --> 16:57.475
- Where's the ball?
- Nice try, amateur.

17:00.188 --> 17:01.621
You call that a trick?

17:01.689 --> 17:03.680
No, I call that a setup.

17:03.758 --> 17:05.953
Here's the trick.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.756
Oh, gross, man. This stuff stinks.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.291
Hey, hey!

17:13.367 --> 17:14.857
Hey, do you want this?

17:14.935 --> 17:16.869
Fetch. Go get it, boy.

17:16.938 --> 17:19.236
Your dad called me this morning.

17:19.307 --> 17:22.571
I got the raise. And thank you.

17:23.678 --> 17:25.669
This isn't over.

17:26.681 --> 17:32.745
I got the raise, and dumped it on you.
I dumped it on him.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.288
- I dumped it on you.
- Jackson?

17:35.356 --> 17:39.793
Melissa! Great news!
I'm a man with money and a lotta gas.

17:40.628 --> 17:42.459
In my car.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.128
What did you do to this little boy?

17:45.900 --> 17:48.960
First of all, he's not a little boy.

17:49.036 --> 17:51.732
I want my mommy!

17:53.307 --> 17:54.501
Stop that!

17:54.575 --> 17:57.772
No, you stop it.
Make him stop, nice lady.

17:59.347 --> 18:02.839
And to think I came all the way
over here to give you a second chance.

18:03.084 --> 18:05.609
But... He's the devil.

18:06.020 --> 18:08.318
And you're pathetic.

18:08.389 --> 18:11.415
Come on, sweetie, I'll take you home
and wash you off.

18:13.461 --> 18:14.894
Wait.

18:15.129 --> 18:16.596
I have money.

18:25.039 --> 18:27.371
Who wants to talk to me? Hello?

18:27.441 --> 18:30.410
Hi... Oh, you're not important enough.

18:30.478 --> 18:33.470
Oh, look, it's the Montana posse.

18:34.015 --> 18:36.848
Howdy. Nice 'stache.

18:37.385 --> 18:39.285
You grow them fast down south.

18:40.454 --> 18:44.185
Once again, I'm sorry about...
What was I sorry about?

18:44.258 --> 18:46.351
Putting that zit on my child's forehead.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.619
Okay.

18:48.696 --> 18:50.960
Right, well...

18:51.032 --> 18:53.057
Who else wants to talk to me?

18:53.401 --> 18:55.961
Psst! Psst! Psst!

18:57.004 --> 18:58.528
She's with me.

18:59.774 --> 19:01.674
Lilly, what are you doing here?

19:01.742 --> 19:03.266
You're supposed to be
at the skateboard competition.

19:03.344 --> 19:05.141
I'm going straight from here.

19:05.212 --> 19:08.613
But what kind of friend would I be
if I didn't come to support you

19:08.683 --> 19:10.446
after all you did for me?

19:10.518 --> 19:13.487
That's so sweet. Thank you so much.

19:13.554 --> 19:15.522
- Now go.
- No, no, no.

19:16.157 --> 19:19.649
When they pull that cover off
and expose that big zit,

19:20.695 --> 19:22.925
I'm going to be right here for you.

19:22.997 --> 19:27.593
Again. I appreciate it, now leave.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.431
No way, I'm staying.

19:29.503 --> 19:32.939
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like</i>
<i>to present my latest masterpiece,</i>

19:33.007 --> 19:36.841
<i>the worldwide premiere of</i>
<i>the Magic Glow Skin Cream campaign!</i>

19:39.747 --> 19:43.183
Hey, what happened to the zit?
Where'd it go?

19:43.617 --> 19:46.415
Wow! That zit-zapper really works!

19:46.487 --> 19:49.718
Where's my zit? I loved that zit!

19:50.324 --> 19:53.691
That'll teach you to sell us a horse
and then deliver a mule.

19:54.562 --> 19:57.793
- You covered it up.
- Lilly, you don't understand.

19:57.898 --> 20:01.095
Oh, I understand fine. You lied to me.

20:02.069 --> 20:03.661
But, Lilly!

20:04.372 --> 20:08.638
Just because I couldn't take my own
advice, doesn't mean you shouldn't.

20:09.076 --> 20:11.567
I mean,
go to that skateboard competition.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.203
Teach me a lesson.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.872
Be my role model.

20:14.949 --> 20:18.112
Save it. Why should I believe
anything you tell me?

20:18.185 --> 20:22.645
Because you said it was the best thing
I ever did for you.

20:22.823 --> 20:26.850
Well, sometimes I say things
I don't mean.

20:26.927 --> 20:28.554
You should know what that's like.

20:28.629 --> 20:30.722
Lilly, please, give me one minute.

20:30.798 --> 20:34.461
<i>Well, here she is,</i>
<i>the new Magic Glow Skin Girl,</i>

20:34.535 --> 20:37.095
<i>Miss Can't Even Have One</i>
<i>Little Blemish,</i>

20:37.171 --> 20:39.662
<i>no matter how many awards I'd win</i>
<i>if she did. </i>

20:39.740 --> 20:42.709
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Hannah Montana. </i>

20:45.146 --> 20:48.081
<i>Thank you. It's a real honor</i>
<i>to be the spokesperson</i>

20:48.149 --> 20:50.879
<i>for Magic Glow Skin Cleanser. </i>

20:50.951 --> 20:54.443
<i>But if there's one thing I've learned</i>
<i>throughout this entire experience,</i>

20:54.522 --> 20:58.185
<i>it's that nobody's perfect,</i>
<i>even celebrities. </i>

20:58.259 --> 21:01.023
You look pretty perfect up there.

21:01.095 --> 21:04.792
Yeah, but sometimes I look like this.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.323
Whoa.

21:08.836 --> 21:12.465
<i>I didn't want people seeing me</i>
<i>this way, but I was wrong. </i>

21:13.607 --> 21:15.404
<i>Looks aren't everything. </i>

21:15.476 --> 21:17.740
<i>I'm not gonna say</i>
<i>that they don't matter,</i>

21:17.812 --> 21:20.474
<i>but there's stuff that matters more. </i>

21:20.548 --> 21:25.451
<i>And if you let a zit,</i>
<i>or let, say, dorky glasses</i>

21:26.020 --> 21:28.818
<i>stop you from living your life,</i>
<i>you're gonna regret it. </i>

21:28.889 --> 21:31.050
<i>You really will. </i>

21:31.125 --> 21:32.888
<i>So, take your pictures!</i>

21:32.960 --> 21:36.259
<i>Let the world see</i>
<i>that even Hannah Montana gets zits,</i>

21:36.330 --> 21:37.957
<i>and I'm okay with it. </i>

21:42.103 --> 21:44.196
<i>But this, I ain't so crazy about. </i>

21:46.574 --> 21:49.543
You know, for a cowboy,
you're kind of cute.

21:50.277 --> 21:52.404
- Just walk away, sister.
- Okay.

22:08.596 --> 22:13.192
Well, I'll be danged. The boy was right.
That pots and pans cycle

22:13.267 --> 22:16.464
really does get my clothes whiter.

22:16.537 --> 22:17.629
I told you.

22:17.705 --> 22:21.232
And as soon as my stuff is done,
the dryer's all yours.
