NEAL GAMBY:
The teachers, they didn't teach
the test on purpose.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.375
They want you fired.
It's a full mutiny.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.000
-You guys are jerks.
-(CHATTERING)

00:25.542 --> 00:26.875

LEE RUSSELL: Why are you
with Abbott if you're in love
with Snodgrass?

00:30.542 --> 00:31.500
Snodgrass is with Brian.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.417
Yeah, but Abbott...
you hate her.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.208
GAMBY: Look, I'm sorry
I strung you along but...

00:36.208 --> 00:38.000
It's not right,
I can't do this.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Ow!

-(GIRLS LAUGHING)
-Where the hell you get that?

00:46.291 --> 00:47.291
It was in the trunk.

00:47.583 --> 00:51.458
Isn't it really strange
how everything

00:51.458 --> 00:53.458
worked out for Russell?

00:55.750 --> 00:57.500
(WHIMPERING) Sorry I was mean
to you on this trip.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.667
We all make mistakes sometimes.

01:07.458 --> 01:10.458
Okay, kids, I have
an announcement to make.

01:10.458 --> 01:13.375
The HSAP test results are in.

01:13.375 --> 01:17.125
And I wish I could say that
the news was good, but I can't.

01:17.125 --> 01:20.625
It's great!
98th percentile English,

01:20.625 --> 01:22.333
99th percentile math!

01:22.333 --> 01:24.166
The highest scores
in the state!

01:24.166 --> 01:28.000
Russell: Come on!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:28.000 --> 01:29.500

01:31.625 --> 01:33.208

01:33.208 --> 01:36.250
Uh, Jeremy, you have
always been a mentor to me
for a very long time,

01:36.250 --> 01:37.625
so this really means a lot.

01:37.625 --> 01:42.291
I would like to share this
moment with some teachers

01:42.291 --> 01:47.000
who came up with
their own very, very special
ways of helping me out.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.959
Mr. Seychelles, Ms. Deets,

01:49.959 --> 01:55.166
Mr. Milner,

01:57.333 --> 01:59.875
Come on. Come on, that's right.

01:59.875 --> 02:03.083
For all your help
with our HSAP success,

02:03.083 --> 02:06.333
I want to honor you.

02:08.375 --> 02:12.542
Now form a line right there.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.375
And, last but not least,
Ms. Abbott.

02:38.375 --> 02:41.750
Our gold star teachers
will now be available

02:41.750 --> 02:44.291
to all of our students 24/7!

02:44.291 --> 02:49.250
I have posted
their personal phone numbers
on our school's Web site.

02:49.250 --> 02:52.333
And get this.
They will also be

02:52.333 --> 02:56.125
our prom chaperones.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.083
(cheers)
They will be there with you

02:58.083 --> 02:59.667

obstacles we face,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.959

lie before us,

03:17.959 --> 03:22.250
we will fight,

for him everywhere.

03:51.792 --> 03:55.583
Oh, um, he asked me
to give you this.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.834
What the fuck is this,
a spaceship on a ladder?

03:57.834 --> 04:00.291
I think it's a train.

04:00.291 --> 04:01.291
On a ladder?

04:01.291 --> 04:03.458
No, I think
those are train tracks, sir.

04:03.458 --> 04:07.000
Oh, yes.
Yeah.

Hello!

04:16.542 --> 04:18.792
What the fuck, man?
Why are you acting so weird?

04:18.792 --> 04:21.625
You missed the assembly,
you call me out here
to these train tracks.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.750
As you can see, I have
no weapons. I am unarmed.

04:24.750 --> 04:28.083
So, tell me Russell, do you
feel bad about shooting me?

04:28.083 --> 04:30.000
Do I feel bad about what?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.333
So am I.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.375
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Of course we're friends!

04:40.291 --> 04:42.041
I found the shooter's mask
in your Jeep.

04:42.041 --> 04:44.625
You hid it
in your wife's trunk,
you fucking coward!

04:44.625 --> 04:46.667
Uh, okay.
You are completely insane.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.542
I don't know what you're
talking about. Mask, what,
like a Halloween mask?

04:49.542 --> 04:51.208
The shooter's mask,
you motherfucker!

04:51.208 --> 04:53.917

kill me for a job, Russell!

What if you shoot me
in the back as
I'm walking away?

05:21.417 --> 05:23.709
If I want to shoot you
in the back, I could
shoot you in the back.

But I've already told you,
I'm not going to

her whole entire life,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.208

This is what we're
gonna go with, guys.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.875
'Cause he's not gonna
want anyone to know
about what's in here.

23:48.875 --> 23:51.834
This is gonna fuck him up.
This is gonna be the go-to.

I do like the husband.

23:55.417 --> 23:58.417
I think the husband's nice

23:58.417 --> 24:01.041
Neal? What are
you doing here?

24:01.041 --> 24:02.458
What happened to your face?

24:02.458 --> 24:04.959
Gale, don't make me
feel self-conscious
about my wounds, okay?

24:04.959 --> 24:08.834
Look, it's all
coming to an end. It's over.

24:08.834 --> 24:10.083
Whoa, whoa.
What's over?

24:10.083 --> 24:13.083
I thought you already told us
that it was all over?

24:13.083 --> 24:15.750
That's because I thought
it was over, but it wasn't over.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.792
Now is the time when
it's the over for real.

24:17.792 --> 24:20.542
It's all starting
in a few moments.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.875
Is everything okay, buddy?
You need anything from us?

24:22.875 --> 24:26.208
Strength and forgiveness.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.041
I'm about to enter
the belly of the beast

24:28.041 --> 24:29.959
and I'm not sure
if I'm gonna make it out.

24:29.959 --> 24:32.458
So it's important for me
to let the both of you know

24:32.458 --> 24:33.875
how much you mean to me

24:33.875 --> 24:36.375
in case I don't make it
out alive tonight.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.792
Gale, I know you and I have
never been on the same page,

24:38.792 --> 24:41.375
but without you,
there would be no Janelle.

24:41.375 --> 24:45.542
So, for that, there'll always be
a very tiny, minuscule,

that will love you forever.

24:49.041 --> 24:50.667
Wow, Neal, I'm--

24:50.667 --> 24:52.875
Shh. It's fine. Don't say
something snide and ruin it.

Okay, thank you.
