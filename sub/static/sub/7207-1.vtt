09:58.287 --> 09:59.561
At the same time, Lauren?

I leave discreetly,
and you leave in one piece.

Anything you say, Captain Queeg.

10:10.327 --> 10:12.443
A simple... would have been enough.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.965
Do you think your father
would have approved of me?

10:35.447 --> 10:37.517
Would he have had a choice?

10:39.247 --> 10:41.158
- Bye-bye.

hear any more from you. Do you hear?

11:37.647 --> 11:40.400
Always sneaking out!
You hit me again, I'm gonna call the police.

11:40.487 --> 11:41.522
- The police?
- I swear.

11:41.607 --> 11:42.881
You'll call the police, will you?

11:42.967 --> 11:45.481
You've been messing around
with that barmaid all night, I know.

11:45.567 --> 11:47.876
I'm gonna come home when I want to
without any sass from you.

- Hey, mister!

11:53.927 --> 11:55.724
What the hell are you?

11:56.927 --> 11:59.361
I just don't think
you ought to be hitting that lady.

You don't, huh?

12:02.447 --> 12:05.678
Thas my wife.
And none of your damn business.

All right, stay cool now.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.600
Wait a minute.

12:12.847 --> 12:15.680
That was you that woke me up
with that bugle.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.843
No, sir, thas impossible.

12:19.207 --> 12:21.402
This isn't any bugle, this is a French horn.

12:21.487 --> 12:24.285
Well, get it on out of here
before I wrap it around your neck.

12:24.367 --> 12:27.404
All right, I'm doing it. Don't get excited now.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.956
Watch this. See this little thing?

12:31.207 --> 12:34.199
This has got a hole all of its own
right in there, see?

12:34.287 --> 12:35.481
Goes in like that.

12:35.567 --> 12:38.365
Watch how neatly this fits right in here.
Isn't that cozy?

12:38.447 --> 12:40.039
See how silent it is?

12:40.967 --> 12:43.003
What the hell are you saying?

12:44.367 --> 12:46.801
Who, me? Nothing.

12:48.087 --> 12:50.237
Nobody's saying anything around here.

12:50.327 --> 12:53.239
Even my little friend in the tree
stopped singing.

12:53.927 --> 12:55.440
Well, he's smart.

12:55.607 --> 12:58.644
And I'm giving you five minutes
to move on out of here.

12:59.087 --> 13:02.921
Well, I can't move too fast,
all I got is my thumb.

13:03.127 --> 13:04.685
Well, stick it out and hope.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.485
And if I hear another sound
out of that thing...

No, actually, she is gonna stop.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.200
Oh, my Lord.

13:53.527 --> 13:57.406
She's gonna be
a 34-year-old nymphomaniac.

13:58.047 --> 14:01.596
And we're gonna go to the Amazon Basin
together and water ski.

14:01.847 --> 14:04.645

- I am not.
- You are so.

15:48.207 --> 15:50.562
You just can't jump where your rocks are.

15:50.887 --> 15:53.401
You think you just gotta keep doing this.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.162
You don't. Now throw your rock.

before we get up?

16:08.047 --> 16:09.241
Debra.

16:09.447 --> 16:11.722
Why don't you let Miss Humphries
live with us?

16:11.807 --> 16:13.718
Just until Mum comes back, you know.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.320
Thas not the way it works.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.796
- I think it is.
- Debra.

16:18.647 --> 16:20.877
Daddy, what she means is that...

16:21.767 --> 16:24.600
well, we know it was bad
between you and Mother.

16:25.447 --> 16:28.519
And maybe you're scared
of getting married to her again.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.559
Well, what would you guys think
if I married Lauren?

16:39.207 --> 16:41.243
You still like it when I cook, don't you?

16:41.327 --> 16:44.160
Sure, as long as I don't have
to eat Brussel sprouts.

16:44.247 --> 16:46.807
- And when I vacuum on Sundays?
- Who vacuums?

Whas up?

17:05.727 --> 17:07.877
Usual trip to school. I'm on my way in.

17:07.967 --> 17:10.196
Wade, there's something up
at Amos Clements' place.

17:10.287 --> 17:11.560
You might wanna check it out.

17:11.646 --> 17:12.840
Okay.

17:14.607 --> 17:16.962
- Where's your helmet, Daddy?
- I'll wear it twice tomorrow.

17:17.047 --> 17:18.036
You'll bonk your head.

17:18.127 --> 17:21.836
Do as I say, not as I do, yeah.
Hang on, turkeys.

17:21.926 --> 17:23.359
Not so tight.

17:37.927 --> 17:40.316
Then he drove on out
past my dynamite truck.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.160
- I was looking out my window right at him.
- What time was it?

17:43.247 --> 17:45.283
- Well, around 7:00.
- You're sure about that?

- Four times.

17:48.887 --> 17:50.002
Well, are you sure, Amos?

17:50.087 --> 17:52.157
Damn right, I'm sure.
He ran him down backwards...

17:52.247 --> 17:54.317
then he ran forwards over him,
and he did that twice.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.204
- Four times all together?
- Four times.

17:56.287 --> 17:57.800
What kind of a car was he driving?

17:57.887 --> 17:59.878
- I don't know.
- Was it foreign or domestic?

17:59.967 --> 18:01.798
- A little of both.
- What colour?

18:01.887 --> 18:03.400
- Grey, black, maybe.
- Sedan?

18:03.487 --> 18:05.796
What the hell, I'm on trial here?

18:12.527 --> 18:15.280
Station wagon? Hardtop?
Two-door? Four-door?

18:15.967 --> 18:17.639
- I think a two-door.
- All right.

18:17.727 --> 18:20.525
Convertible? Sunroof?
Vinyl top? Landau top?

18:20.607 --> 18:22.916
A guy was getting ground to hamburger,
I wasn't taking notes.

18:23.007 --> 18:26.317
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Whas it to you? She's great.

18:28.047 --> 18:29.162
What about the plate?

18:30.367 --> 18:32.676
- I don't know.
- Did it have a plate?

18:33.007 --> 18:35.237
- I don't know.
- Colour of the plate.

18:35.487 --> 18:36.886
- I don't know.
- You saw it.

18:36.967 --> 18:39.401
- I didn't seen nothing.
- Bullshit. You saw two doors.

18:40.367 --> 18:43.564
What with all that dust in the air,
how could I tell anything for sure?

18:43.647 --> 18:45.319
I don't know. Damn it, I don't know.

18:52.687 --> 18:54.757
What do you mean, for sure?

18:58.447 --> 18:59.641
Well...

19:00.527 --> 19:02.597
maybe the top...

19:03.567 --> 19:06.684
was squeezed down low.

19:07.927 --> 19:09.599
There was no plate.

19:10.207 --> 19:11.560
Wade, Luke.

19:13.327 --> 19:16.285
Wade, you'd better get on the
phone and call the Daigler County Seat...

19:16.367 --> 19:17.720
in case he crossed the line.

19:20.047 --> 19:23.676
Sling the net.
We've got a crazy on our hands.

19:24.287 --> 19:25.845

MAN: Chas, quit playing sheriff
and go back to what you people do best?

19:33.807 --> 19:36.446

19:36.527 --> 19:39.803
'cause I'm gonna track you down

19:57.327 --> 19:58.919
His father's in...

19:59.247 --> 20:02.159

whatever the hell that is.

20:02.447 --> 20:05.166
Thas his phone number down,
the business phone.

20:05.647 --> 20:07.365
Should I talk to him...

20:08.207 --> 20:10.801
- or to the mother?
- I can do it.

20:16.087 --> 20:17.486
Thanks, Wade.

20:19.167 --> 20:22.443
Chas, got anything from Daigler County?

20:22.527 --> 20:25.519
Yeah, Sheriff Papez would appreciate
a little more information...

20:25.607 --> 20:28.519
as to what in the hell
they're supposed to be looking for.

20:28.607 --> 20:31.360
- Thas a quote.
- Well, he's got what I got.

20:32.967 --> 20:36.198
Now, look.
I want everybody out on the street.

20:37.887 --> 20:41.163
I want you to remember,
a young man was killed today...

20:41.727 --> 20:44.525
passing through our town,
and I don't like it.

20:46.927 --> 20:48.758
I don't like it at all.

20:52.287 --> 20:53.481
Goodbye.

21:20.687 --> 21:21.961
Enough.

21:22.567 --> 21:24.637
All right, that was delicious.

21:25.887 --> 21:28.879
Miss Humphries, I'd like to speak
to you for a moment.

21:28.967 --> 21:30.559
- Sure.
- In private.

21:31.047 --> 21:35.040
Okay, take a break.
And we will rehearse this march for real.

21:36.007 --> 21:37.884
All right. Okay girls, up.

21:38.247 --> 21:40.317
Come on, over here. Right here.

21:41.687 --> 21:43.882
I would like to know what this is.

21:47.767 --> 21:49.246
This is sweet.

21:50.287 --> 21:53.245
Look, Miss McDonald, he's made me a 36-D.

21:53.527 --> 21:56.360
- You know who did it?
- Sure. This is Tommy Ness again.

21:56.447 --> 21:57.926
His proportion's always off.

21:58.007 --> 22:00.567
- Are you saying thas a picture of you?
- Yes.

22:00.647 --> 22:03.207
- Well, I must say, I'm surprised.
- Why?

22:03.287 --> 22:06.279
Lauren, do you think is healthy
for a 13-year-old boy...

22:06.367 --> 22:08.323
to imagine his teacher naked?

22:08.407 --> 22:12.036
- Absolutely.
- Well, not in this school, it isn't.

22:15.567 --> 22:18.604

22:27.647 --> 22:29.603

- Hi, whare you doing here?

22:30.007 --> 22:31.884
- Hi, Wade.
- Time to change drivers.

22:31.967 --> 22:33.764
- Hello, Captain.
- Crooks beware.

22:33.847 --> 22:35.838
Well, how about a hug, you hunk?

22:36.847 --> 22:40.203
- Honey, here?
- Isn't that darling? He's so shy.

22:40.287 --> 22:41.322
Daddy!

22:41.407 --> 22:43.318
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, turkeys.

22:43.407 --> 22:44.635

22:44.727 --> 22:46.877
We're gonna get to be cowgirls
in the parade.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.800
- You're never no such thing.
- 'Cause we know how to ride.

22:49.887 --> 22:51.206
Who knew first?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.039
- I did.
- I did.

22:53.127 --> 22:55.197
The bell, girls. Don't you have a gym class?

22:55.287 --> 22:56.845
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.446
FATS: 22, are you there?

23:04.007 --> 23:05.486
Yeah, this is Wade. Come on.

23:05.567 --> 23:06.602
Is me, Fats.

23:06.687 --> 23:09.360
We're at the north side of the High Road.
We got some bad news here.

23:09.447 --> 23:11.324
Everett just arrived,
and he wants you pronto.

23:11.407 --> 23:12.886
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

23:55.487 --> 23:56.681
Come on.

23:57.287 --> 23:59.403
EVERETT: Tell me it was an accident.

23:59.487 --> 24:03.036
- No way, Everett.
- Has she got a locket? Heart shaped?

24:07.167 --> 24:08.680
Yeah, she does.

24:09.927 --> 24:12.122
God damn. Damn it.

24:30.047 --> 24:32.163
What in the hell is going on?

24:35.087 --> 24:38.841
Wade, you know
Dr. Pullbrook's daughter, Suzie?

24:39.487 --> 24:41.603
- You ever seen her?
- Yeah. Why?

24:42.247 --> 24:44.044
You think you'd know her
if you saw her again?

24:44.127 --> 24:45.719
What do you mean, Ev?

24:45.807 --> 24:49.083
Well, she took off last Thursday
with a guy by the name of Pete Keil.

24:49.167 --> 24:50.600
Bicycling, you know, camping.

24:50.687 --> 24:52.837
Pete Keil? Lmpossible.

24:53.167 --> 24:54.282
Well, how do you know?

24:54.367 --> 24:58.246
Well, the kiďs a neighbour of mine. He told
me he was going to Ogden on Thursday.

24:58.327 --> 24:59.396
- He told you?
- Yeah.

24:59.487 --> 25:01.000
Well, how come?

25:01.647 --> 25:04.764
A few years back the kid was
in my Bible class, you know...

25:04.847 --> 25:07.919
and then his dad died,
and Pete kind of took a shine to me.

25:08.527 --> 25:09.880
It couldn't be him.

25:09.967 --> 25:13.437
He had a job interview in Ogden
on Thursday. I gave him a letter.

25:13.527 --> 25:15.358
- Has he got a mother?
- Yeah. Alice.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.961
Alice? Well, maybe he lied to Alice...

25:18.047 --> 25:21.357
because he didn't want her to know what
he had on his mind about Suzie. Anyway...

25:21.447 --> 25:23.278
Ev, the kid has never lied to me.

25:23.367 --> 25:25.039
Well, les hope so, Luke.

25:25.127 --> 25:27.721
And les hope he got nothing
to do with this.

25:27.807 --> 25:29.877
You're sure is his daughter?

25:30.327 --> 25:34.559
A bicycle, camping gear,
a heart-shaped locket.

25:35.727 --> 25:37.285
Everything checks.

25:37.407 --> 25:40.205
Now, Ev, you don't think
the same car did it?

25:41.367 --> 25:43.722
Well, I'd say that was
a damn good guess, Wade.

25:43.807 --> 25:45.604
You got a time of death?

25:45.767 --> 25:48.235
Chas says it was some time this morning.

25:48.527 --> 25:50.279
About five or six hours ago.

25:51.127 --> 25:53.436
But what beats the hell out of me
is where's this boy?

25:53.527 --> 25:55.358
Ev, I told you he's in Ogden.

25:56.007 --> 25:59.283
Ev, you looked
over the whole area, didn't you?

25:59.367 --> 26:01.164
Well, yeah, thoroughly.

26:03.287 --> 26:05.118
Wade, I want roadblocks...

26:05.207 --> 26:08.563
on Interstate, Casper, Webster,
and Delaware...

26:08.807 --> 26:10.604
and on the desert side.

26:10.967 --> 26:14.277
No cars, black, grey, blue, get in or out.

26:16.607 --> 26:19.041
I want this entire area sealed off.

26:20.727 --> 26:21.796
Yeah.

26:22.767 --> 26:26.919
Yeah, 10 years of giving out traffic tickets,
and all this in one day.

26:27.087 --> 26:28.202
Yeah.

26:29.687 --> 26:33.362
And in addition to the road blocks,
now I want the street patrols going all night.

26:33.447 --> 26:36.996
Some of you have drawn long hours,
and I'm sorry about that.

26:37.087 --> 26:40.682
We'll split the shifts as best we can.
These are your assignments.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.723
Did you check on the kid?

26:42.927 --> 26:44.838
He never showed up in Ogden.

26:47.327 --> 26:50.364
We'd better see what we got
in the armaments locker.

26:54.367 --> 26:57.165
If you don't press charges, Bertha,
there's nothing I can do.

26:57.247 --> 26:59.363
That bastard can get up
and walk out of here.

26:59.447 --> 27:01.597
And when he finally decides
to roll back home...

27:01.687 --> 27:03.405

27:03.487 --> 27:06.957

over the county line again, don't call me.

get it over with...

Here, sign it.

27:26.447 --> 27:28.358
Out. Now.

28:33.247 --> 28:35.397
You don't have to go home, Bertha.

28:36.327 --> 28:39.364
We can put you and the kid up
in a motel tonight.

28:39.887 --> 28:42.276

28:44.687 --> 28:46.325
can talk things out.

now. I'm gonna have a drink with the boys.

29:39.727 --> 29:42.685
- Whiskey! Les go to the club.
- All right, I'm buying.

29:42.767 --> 29:45.725
You said a good thing there.
Or was that me?

29:46.607 --> 29:49.167
You know what your father once said to me?

29:52.487 --> 29:55.126
I was gonna make it up anyhow.
How you doing?

29:55.247 --> 29:56.839
You know, this morning all I had to do...

29:56.927 --> 30:00.158
was to figure out some way
to get the girls to accept Lauren.

30:02.367 --> 30:03.436
Yeah.

30:07.007 --> 30:10.283
Are you gonna stand there philosophising,
or are you gonna buy me a drink?

30:10.367 --> 30:13.643
You're not smart enough to do both.
Now, come on. Come on, boy.

30:14.087 --> 30:16.282

30:16.367 --> 30:20.485

01:00:46.447 --> 01:00:49.245
I had to lock up Amos Clements
this afternoon.

01:00:49.327 --> 01:00:50.646
Okay, I'll be there in a little while.

01:00:50.727 --> 01:00:53.719
He had a shotgun and was screaming
bloody murder again.

01:00:53.807 --> 01:00:55.081
Yeah, Luke's okay.

01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:58.318
His son getting hurt,
us letting the car into town.

01:00:59.207 --> 01:01:02.643
We had a few good words, you know. Okay?

01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:05.436
Wade?

01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:08.847
Your kids want to speak to you, okay?

01:01:10.647 --> 01:01:12.080
Hi, you guys.

01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:16.916
Yeah, I'm okay. The doctor just
checked me out, and I'm just fine.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.965
Don't let anything
ever happen to you, Daddy.

01:01:20.207 --> 01:01:22.767
Nothing's gonna happen to me,
I'm too ornery, you know that.

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:24.519
Daddy, you should have
heard Lauren today.

01:01:24.607 --> 01:01:26.757
She cussed that car so bad.

01:01:26.847 --> 01:01:29.805
- She called him a chicken...
- Never mind, Debra.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.845
Anyway, if I was him, I'd never come back.

01:01:33.327 --> 01:01:36.319
All right, get on to bed.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:01:36.407 --> 01:01:39.558
Lauren's gonna spend the night with you.
I love you.

01:02:00.247 --> 01:02:03.398
Well, if I'm gonna spend the night
with the kids...

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:07.480
I guess I better stop by my place
and get some clothes and things.

01:02:09.447 --> 01:02:10.766
Yeah, okay.

01:02:11.367 --> 01:02:13.801
- Chas, drive her home, will you?
- Sure.

01:02:17.207 --> 01:02:18.526
Sleep well.

01:02:26.807 --> 01:02:27.956
Chas.

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:45.160
Come in here.

01:02:54.607 --> 01:02:56.040
Close the door.

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:13.240
What happened?

01:03:14.327 --> 01:03:15.442
What do you mean?

01:03:15.527 --> 01:03:19.122
I told you to cancel that parade rehearsal.
What happened?

01:03:21.327 --> 01:03:22.806
What happened?

01:03:27.247 --> 01:03:28.521
I think...

01:03:30.167 --> 01:03:32.601
when Mackey started...

01:03:34.127 --> 01:03:35.799
talking about Ev...

01:03:37.167 --> 01:03:40.443
and the funeral arrangements, I guess...

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.842
Is not what I think it is, is it?

01:03:44.967 --> 01:03:46.161
No.

01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:01.845
I loved him too, Luke.

01:04:02.767 --> 01:04:04.564
Is been so much.

01:04:09.487 --> 01:04:11.000
Is been a lot.

01:04:41.607 --> 01:04:45.122
- Whas the matter?
- Nothing. Just checking the tepee.

01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:47.478
The old lady, two kids.

01:05:24.207 --> 01:05:26.163
How long are you gonna be?

01:05:28.487 --> 01:05:31.877
- Not long. Why don't you come in?
- Do you mind if I...

01:05:33.007 --> 01:05:36.602
Of course, you're worried about your family.
Well, go check on them.

01:05:36.727 --> 01:05:39.560
Come back in about a half hour, okay?

01:06:35.847 --> 01:06:37.678
Oh, my God.

01:07:15.807 --> 01:07:18.196
Hello? Wade Parens room, please.

01:07:21.327 --> 01:07:24.683
Hello, Wade? Is me, baby. No, I'm home.

01:07:25.047 --> 01:07:28.596
Chas went over to his place.
He said he'd be back in a few minutes.

01:07:28.687 --> 01:07:32.600
Wade, no, I'm all right. Listen to me.

01:07:33.287 --> 01:07:37.041
As I was coming up to the house,
that crazy wind came up.

01:07:38.247 --> 01:07:40.397
It almost blew me off my feet.

01:07:41.087 --> 01:07:42.281
Wade...

01:07:42.647 --> 01:07:45.764
I think I hear the engine of that damn car.

01:07:46.367 --> 01:07:50.042
Wade, is sounds so weird.
Wade, I'm scared.

01:07:50.127 --> 01:07:53.403
No, I promise you I won't go out.
Tell me what to do, baby...

01:07:59.607 --> 01:08:02.280
[Car horn blaring rhythmically]

01:09:22.807 --> 01:09:23.876
Lauren.

01:09:26.487 --> 01:09:28.443
CHAS: I shouldn't have left her.

01:09:32.327 --> 01:09:34.124
Nothing would have changed.

01:09:35.247 --> 01:09:37.283
He'd have taken you out, too.

01:09:44.926 --> 01:09:46.439
I talked to her.

01:09:47.727 --> 01:09:50.287
She called me when she got back here.

01:09:52.727 --> 01:09:55.799
She could hear the engine
coming down the street.

01:09:56.807 --> 01:09:58.604
She was so frightened.

01:10:01.767 --> 01:10:03.280
I don't know.

01:10:08.127 --> 01:10:10.846
LUKE: I know why
he didn't go into the cemetery.

01:10:15.847 --> 01:10:19.476
I know why. There's no other reason.

01:10:21.847 --> 01:10:24.520
The ground was hallowed.

01:10:28.967 --> 01:10:31.640
Thas what I say, but you think about it.

01:10:32.287 --> 01:10:34.403
Everything thas happened.

01:10:35.487 --> 01:10:37.955
What it did to the guys and how.

01:10:47.847 --> 01:10:50.077
Everybody else was killed on the street.

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:53.239
Lauren was killed in the middle
of her own living room.

01:10:53.607 --> 01:10:56.644
She was special! Why?

01:10:57.167 --> 01:10:59.556
Because she cursed him, thas why.

01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:03.327
I don't believe it. I don't accept it.

01:11:03.407 --> 01:11:07.082
Wade, that car flew into that house
four feet off the ground.

01:11:08.327 --> 01:11:10.795
And how did he know where she lived?

01:11:16.367 --> 01:11:18.198
Keep the roadblocks up.

01:11:19.367 --> 01:11:21.244
Get all the other guys.

01:11:21.927 --> 01:11:24.316
Get them down at the station right away.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:40.360
- Whas up?
- I don't know. Les go find out.

01:11:49.127 --> 01:11:51.641
- Do you guys want some coffee?
- Please.

01:12:14.567 --> 01:12:16.239
Chas, get Amos.

01:12:24.327 --> 01:12:26.966
You probably have about two hours.

01:12:27.047 --> 01:12:29.436
You just snap your fingers,
and poof! He appears.

01:12:29.527 --> 01:12:32.678
I don't know,
but I'll be the only one on the streets.

01:12:33.647 --> 01:12:37.606
Get our van, too, divide the stuff in half.
One of you has got to get there.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.723
You're that sure he'll show?

01:12:39.847 --> 01:12:42.759
No, but what have we got to lose?

01:12:45.287 --> 01:12:47.323
You stay on the switchboard.

01:12:48.327 --> 01:12:51.524
I'm going. They were my friends, too.

01:12:52.287 --> 01:12:54.039
Is about God damn time, Tonto.

01:12:54.127 --> 01:12:57.324
These God damn roaches
are as big as hen eggs. What...

01:12:59.527 --> 01:13:01.119
What are you doing?

01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:03.885
This ain't no way...

01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:07.880
I'm a taxpayer, you damn savage.
I pay your salary.

01:13:08.687 --> 01:13:10.917
I'll sue you. I'll sue the city.

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:15.566
You're choking me, Chas.
You dumb Indian. Turn me loose.

01:13:16.247 --> 01:13:17.999
Sit on...

01:13:18.767 --> 01:13:19.882
down.

01:13:28.327 --> 01:13:29.680
We need you.

01:14:14.287 --> 01:14:15.481
I got it.

01:14:24.207 --> 01:14:26.880
Easy. You cough with these blasting caps...

01:14:26.967 --> 01:14:30.437
and they'll blow your balls up
around your tonsils. Easy, now.

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:53.926
Okay, les go.

01:16:35.047 --> 01:16:37.561
- Lauren, is that you?
- Margie, is Wade.

01:16:37.647 --> 01:16:39.638
- Wade? I thought it was Lauren.
- Margie, listen to me.

01:16:39.727 --> 01:16:42.844
- Why aren't you in the hospital?
- Don't come in here. Go back upstairs.

01:16:42.927 --> 01:16:45.760
- Whas the matter?
- Did you hear me? Get in the house.

01:16:45.847 --> 01:16:49.476
- What is wrong, Wade?
- Go back upstairs. The car, is in here.

01:16:50.247 --> 01:16:51.566
Oh, my God.

- Debra.
- My ears hurt.

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.042
Ill be okay.

01:19:19.047 --> 01:19:20.560

[Car horn blaring rhythmically]

Guys, he's hanging in right on my tail.
You better be ready.

01:20:36.567 --> 01:20:38.842
LUKE: You're too early.
We're still on the way, for Chriss sake.

01:20:38.927 --> 01:20:41.157
You're still on the way?
Did Amos get to the canyon yet?

01:20:41.247 --> 01:20:42.600
LUKE: How the hell should I know?

01:20:42.687 --> 01:20:44.279
Stall him, Wade, you've got to stall him.

01:20:55.367 --> 01:20:56.595
WADE: Luke, do you read me?

01:20:56.687 --> 01:20:59.679
He's turned off the main road,
going north across Jelly's Field.

01:20:59.767 --> 01:21:02.201
He's really moving.
I can barely keep up with him.

01:21:02.287 --> 01:21:03.276

exactly where he's going.

is coming right behind us.

01:21:12.887 --> 01:21:14.320
LUKE: Okay, hang on.

01:21:15.367 --> 01:21:17.164
He's going towards the canyon.

01:21:50.007 --> 01:21:52.840
I've got him, Luke.
Get to the top of the canyon.

01:22:06.807 --> 01:22:10.686
- Ashberry, how many have we planted now?
- About five cases, Chas.

01:22:11.607 --> 01:22:14.758
Amos, how many have you got left?

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:18.556
I got about 10 cases left. I hear an engine.

01:22:18.647 --> 01:22:20.399
Can you see anything?

01:22:21.847 --> 01:22:25.760
- Two vehicles. One's a bike.
- Shit. Somebody's early.

01:23:44.487 --> 01:23:45.966
No time to plant your sticks.

01:23:46.047 --> 01:23:48.845

and place as many boxes as we can.

- Where's the rope?
- Just below the rise there.

over to the other side.
