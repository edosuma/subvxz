Is it Frodo?

04:21.682 --> 04:25.476
That's a hobbit. (SIGHS)
You are so in over your head.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.440
Actually, this is Harold.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.232
I've never heard of
a flying reindeer
named Harold.

04:32.232 --> 04:35.275
That's because he can't fly.
Then why do you have him?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.658
Well, Blitzen's getting
up there in years,

04:37.658 --> 04:39.279
so it's time for him
to retire.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.951
Oh, my grandpa did that.

04:40.951 --> 04:43.404
Now all he does
is watch infomercials,

04:43.404 --> 04:45.576
and wear his pants
up to his armpits.

04:46.497 --> 04:48.369
Cool.

04:48.369 --> 04:50.621
Anyway, Harold here
is Blitzen's nephew,

04:50.621 --> 04:52.373
so he seemed like
a good replacement.

04:52.373 --> 04:53.624
But I've been
trying for weeks,

04:53.624 --> 04:56.467
and he just can't seem
to fly.

04:56.467 --> 04:59.510
He might have
something missing upstairs,
if you know what I mean.

04:59.510 --> 05:01.762
Oh, we know.

05:01.762 --> 05:05.636
So, I'm headed down to Miami
to check out a new home
for Harold.

05:05.636 --> 05:09.269
They've got a sanctuary there
for non-magical animals.

05:09.269 --> 05:11.892
I think those
are called zoos.

05:11.892 --> 05:14.525
Ooh, I've gotta go
if I'm going to catch
my flight.

05:14.525 --> 05:16.106
Why don't you just
take your sleigh?

05:16.106 --> 05:17.938
I gotta use my miles!

05:21.572 --> 05:23.904
You should have seen
Griff's murderous machine.

05:23.904 --> 05:25.656
It was a spinning blade
of death,

05:25.656 --> 05:27.618
laying waste to everything
in its path!

05:27.618 --> 05:29.750
Whoa. You think
he'll let me borrow it

05:29.750 --> 05:33.163
next time Hazel tries
to check me for ticks?

05:33.163 --> 05:36.377
Lou and I asked him
why he did it,
but he would not open up.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.460
He is a tough nut to crack.
How do you think
I should approach him?

05:39.460 --> 05:41.341
Carefully, if he has
a spinning blade of death.

05:43.263 --> 05:46.056
Oh, hey, guys!
Xander, I made
a present for you.

05:46.056 --> 05:48.348
Thanks. That's so sweet
of you.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.640
Ta-da!

05:49.640 --> 05:51.392
Wow.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.394
Yeah, we were making
jewelry for the Christmas
charity drive,

05:53.394 --> 05:54.975
and it inspired me.

05:54.975 --> 05:57.818
I see that.

05:57.818 --> 06:00.280
It's "found art."
It's all the rage
in New York.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.614
Like throwing subway tokens
at hipsters.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.285
So, do you love it?

06:06.827 --> 06:08.158
Well, the truth is...

06:08.158 --> 06:11.452
I think
it is a wonderful gift.

06:11.452 --> 06:13.994
Xander is such a lucky man.

06:13.994 --> 06:15.626
You love it,
do you not?

06:17.548 --> 06:21.131
Um... I sure do!
I love it!

06:21.131 --> 06:22.713
Aw, thanks!

06:22.713 --> 06:24.675
When I made it, I thought
it just screamed Xander.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.850
It makes me
want to scream, too.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.352
You cannot tell Emma
you do not like her gift.

06:32.352 --> 06:34.354
You have to wear
that monstrosity!

06:34.354 --> 06:36.226
No way!

06:36.226 --> 06:39.359
This a door hinge
from the old outhouse!

06:39.359 --> 06:43.734
Xander, Emma is
very sensitive about
her fashion creations.

06:43.734 --> 06:46.076
Once she made me one of
those infinity scarves,

06:46.076 --> 06:49.490
and I asked her to cut it,
so it would have,
you know, ends?

06:49.490 --> 06:51.331
And what did she do?

06:51.331 --> 06:55.415
She wrapped it around me
and squeezed really tight
until the room went dark.

06:56.877 --> 06:58.709
Well, that doesn't
sound good.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.462
(SNIFFS)
And this doesn't smell good.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.594
I don't think
she washed this hinge.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.639
Hey, guys, watch what
I just taught Harold to do!

07:08.639 --> 07:11.722
Harold, what's the lowest
prime integer?

07:14.144 --> 07:17.768
(GASPS) Good boy!
Who's a smart reindeer?

07:17.768 --> 07:19.860
If you keep teaching him
stuff like that,

07:19.860 --> 07:21.612
Dasher will give him
an atomic wedgie.

07:22.983 --> 07:26.827
Good thing reindeer
don't wear underpants.

07:26.827 --> 07:30.240
I don't know why Santa had
so much trouble training
Harold to fly.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.452
Maybe he just needs
more practice.

07:33.283 --> 07:35.245
Harold, do you want to fly?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.420
See? So it's settled.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.462
We're gonna teach Harold
how to fly!

07:42.462 --> 07:45.255
Yes! And after that,
we'll start him
on pre-calculus!

07:46.466 --> 07:48.348
Stay away from this one,

07:48.348 --> 07:51.431
or pretty soon your harness
will have a pocket protector.

07:56.767 --> 08:00.771
So, Griff, buddy, pal.

08:00.771 --> 08:03.694
We are here to have
a friendly little chat.

08:03.694 --> 08:06.406
Why did you decide to make
such a dangerous "toy"?

08:06.406 --> 08:08.909
Um, because making
Christmas gifts is lame.

08:08.909 --> 08:11.371
Sorry for trying
to have some fun.

08:11.371 --> 08:15.916
"Fun"? Is that why you came
to toy-making class?
For fun?

08:15.916 --> 08:18.498
Um, no. I came because
you guys told me I had to.

08:19.920 --> 08:25.085
You sliced a poor,
innocent, stuffed puppy
in half,

08:25.085 --> 08:28.719
and widowed
poor Mrs. Sugarbuttons.

08:31.261 --> 08:35.225
You probably like
that kind of thing.
You make me sick.

08:35.225 --> 08:37.227
Okay.

08:37.227 --> 08:41.061
I apologize for Lou.
She can get
a little hot-headed.

08:41.061 --> 08:44.064
Uh, would you like
some water?
Perhaps a bon-bon?

08:45.606 --> 08:47.858
Guys, I know you're playing
good cop, bad cop.

08:47.858 --> 08:50.150
I've been
interrogated before.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.703
Although, never by a cop
with his fly down.

08:53.243 --> 08:55.495
(PANTS ZIPPING)

08:55.495 --> 08:57.788
Well, that tainted
the investigation.

08:59.660 --> 09:02.162
Seriously, Griff,
what were you thinking?

09:02.162 --> 09:04.625
The toys we made
were Christmas gifts
for needy kids.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.086
So what?

09:06.086 --> 09:08.298
So, those kids
don't have much,
and this is a nice way to...

09:08.298 --> 09:10.430
I don't care
about those kids!

09:10.430 --> 09:11.972
I don't care
about any of this!

09:12.973 --> 09:14.885
Just leave me alone!

09:17.387 --> 09:20.270
This is terrible.
I know.

09:20.270 --> 09:23.814
Why did you not tell me
my fly was down?

09:23.814 --> 09:26.947
Because I'm the bad cop.

09:33.033 --> 09:36.116
It's too hot!
Do we really have to wear
these coats?

09:36.116 --> 09:41.201
Yes! The best way for Harold
to learn to fly is to pretend
it's Christmas time!

09:41.201 --> 09:43.583
Just pretending
isn't going to get it done.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.876
He needs to study
and practice and work

09:45.876 --> 09:50.090
until he feels like his tummy
is filled with razor blades!

09:50.090 --> 09:51.341
Wow, you need a hug.

09:53.383 --> 09:55.475
Come on.
Now, let's get to it.

09:55.475 --> 09:57.718
It's like a thousand degrees
in here.

09:57.718 --> 10:00.891
Seriously, I'm making
butt soup!

10:03.063 --> 10:05.065
(PRETEND SHIVERING)

10:05.065 --> 10:08.989
It sure does feel
Christmassy around here,
Harold.

10:08.989 --> 10:15.495
Yeah, you can tell by these
drops of holiday cheer
rolling down my forehead.

10:15.495 --> 10:19.159
Did you put that bucket of
mashed potato flakes
in the loft like I told you?

10:19.159 --> 10:20.370
Yep.
Okay.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.412
When I give the cue,
pull the rope,

10:22.412 --> 10:25.375
and the flakes will
come down in a delicious
wintery blizzard!

10:28.048 --> 10:30.340
TIFFANY: Okay, Harold,
you're cleared for takeoff!

10:30.340 --> 10:31.631
Get ready to fly!

10:36.056 --> 10:39.559
Zuri, did you put water
in the mashed potatoes?

10:39.559 --> 10:41.892
Yep!
Why?

10:41.892 --> 10:45.976
(LAUGHING)
Because it's hilarious!
I couldn't resist.

10:47.858 --> 10:49.359
Tiffany, stay right there.

10:49.359 --> 10:50.901
Are you getting me a towel?

10:50.901 --> 10:54.114
Nope. I'm getting some gravy
and maybe a roll.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.951
Guys, I'm worried
about Griff.

11:00.951 --> 11:04.084
Ever since
the toy-making disaster,
he's been so moody.

11:04.084 --> 11:08.919
No kidding. When I asked him
to clear his tray at lunch,
he dumped it in my lap.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.091
He was really angry
when we tried to
talk to him, too.

11:11.091 --> 11:13.593
And later, I heard him
making fun of
the way you talk.

11:13.593 --> 11:18.428
Hey! What in the gosh-darn
diddly-dong is wrong
with the way I talk?

11:18.428 --> 11:21.351
Not a gosh-darn
diddly-ding-dong thing.

11:21.351 --> 11:24.144
Oh, I know, I'll make Griff
one of my necklaces!

11:24.144 --> 11:26.767
They bring happiness
to every neck
that wears one.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.188
That, and a nasty rash.
(CHUCKLES)

11:29.980 --> 11:31.191
What did you just say?

11:33.443 --> 11:35.025
Ravi, I'm just going to
tell her the truth.

11:35.025 --> 11:38.578
Okay, broseph.
I have your back.

11:38.578 --> 11:42.082
Look, Emma, it is so sweet
that you made this necklace
for me.

11:42.082 --> 11:45.205
But it's just
not exactly for me.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.207
And Ravi agrees with me.
Right, Ravi?

11:47.207 --> 11:50.210
Yes, Emma, I agree

11:50.210 --> 11:52.002
that Xander
hates your necklace.
What?

11:53.173 --> 11:56.216
Oh, snap,
this just got good.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.299
Ravi, you hate it, too!
You said it looked like
a string of turds!

11:59.299 --> 12:00.841
(GASPS)

12:00.841 --> 12:02.262
Do not believe him, Emma!

12:02.262 --> 12:04.434
He already lied about
loving the necklace!

12:04.434 --> 12:05.435
(WHISPERS) I am sorry!

12:07.187 --> 12:09.109
In fact, what else
has Xander lied about?

12:09.109 --> 12:10.730
If that is even
his real name!

12:10.730 --> 12:11.812
(WHISPERS) So sorry!

12:13.403 --> 12:14.404
Okay, enough!

12:15.735 --> 12:20.530
Emma, I apologize,
but please don't be mad.

12:20.530 --> 12:23.864
Oh, it's okay. I'm not mad.
What makes you think
I'm mad?

12:25.165 --> 12:26.166
(GRUNTS)

12:29.749 --> 12:30.961
I think Emma is mad.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.136
Okay, Harold,
it's Christmas Eve.

12:36.136 --> 12:40.090
All the children of the world
are depending on you
to help fly Santa's sleigh.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.762
I just hope
Grant from Badger Cabin
doesn't see me.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.386
I'm this close to closing
the deal on that cutie!

12:46.386 --> 12:48.438
Sorry if this
is embarrassing,

12:48.438 --> 12:50.891
but your idea
got us nowhere.

12:50.891 --> 12:54.985
Hey, reading
the  Principles of Flight
to Harold would've worked,

12:54.985 --> 12:56.857
if he hadn't eaten
chapter three.

12:58.238 --> 12:59.900
Actually, that was me.

13:01.241 --> 13:02.993
What? I never got that roll.

13:05.165 --> 13:08.038
Come on, guys.
Harold needs to fly now.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.120
Santa will be back
in a few hours.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.002
Yeah, and if
Harold can't fly by then,

13:12.002 --> 13:14.624
he's going to be spending
the rest of his life in Miami

13:14.624 --> 13:17.587
with a bunch of
liver-spotted old fogies!

13:17.587 --> 13:20.881
You guys need to stop
putting so much pressure
on him!

13:20.881 --> 13:23.844
What we need to do
is get him in the air!

13:23.844 --> 13:27.097
'Cause this Santa suit
is starting to chafe
something fierce!

13:28.889 --> 13:33.483
Okay, Harold,
just picture yourself
soaring through the sky!

13:33.483 --> 13:39.149
On Jorge! On Tiffany!
On Harold!

13:39.149 --> 13:41.031
Come on, boy!
You can do it!

13:46.036 --> 13:49.079
It's no use.
He can't fly.

13:49.079 --> 13:53.453
Yes, he can!
Come on, Harold!
Fly! Fly!

13:53.453 --> 13:57.217
Like this! (GRUNTING)

14:00.170 --> 14:03.383
No, Grant, come back!

14:03.383 --> 14:07.227
Great. There goes
momma's chance
at summer snugglin'.

14:12.732 --> 14:15.145
Okay, Griff,
we need to talk.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.977
Yes, what is bothering you?

14:16.977 --> 14:18.278
We really want you
to open up.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.321
Okay.

14:21.321 --> 14:24.324
(SIGHS) I think your eyes
are too far apart.

14:26.246 --> 14:28.078
Okay, how about
we close it back up
a little?

14:29.749 --> 14:31.251
Griff, you're such
a good kid.

14:31.251 --> 14:33.163
But lately, something's
been up with you,

14:33.163 --> 14:35.665
starting with that terrifying
Christmas toy you made.

14:35.665 --> 14:38.878
Guys, nothing's bothering me.
I'm fine.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.420
Griff, stop.

14:40.420 --> 14:43.383
You know you can
talk to us, right?
That is what we're here for.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.386
Okay, okay.
If it'll get you
off my back.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.509
The truth is,
I hate Christmas.

14:49.509 --> 14:52.012
You hate Christmas?
Why?

14:52.012 --> 14:55.275
Because
Christmas in juvie stunk.

14:55.275 --> 14:58.188
All we got
was extra visitation time,

14:58.188 --> 15:01.151
but I didn't have anyone
to come visit me.

15:01.151 --> 15:04.654
So, Christmas just reminds me
of what I don't have.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.367
I'm so sorry, Griff.
We had no idea.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.578
Just forget it.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.375
I feel so bad for him.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.496
Me, too.

15:19.539 --> 15:22.092
Are you looking to see
if my eyes
are too far apart?

15:22.963 --> 15:24.214
No.

15:26.386 --> 15:27.807
I'm sorry,
I just can't look away.

15:34.394 --> 15:35.435
XANDER: Emma, wait up.

15:36.646 --> 15:38.398
You can take
the necklace off now, Xander.

15:38.398 --> 15:42.022
Oh, I know, but Chad bet me
a hundred bucks
I couldn't wear it all week.

15:43.273 --> 15:45.155
I was gonna split it
with you.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.240
Xander, why didn't you
just tell me you didn't like
the necklace?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.622
Because I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

15:52.622 --> 15:56.246
Also, Ravi said you can
get really scary about
this gift stuff.

15:56.246 --> 16:00.250
You listened to Ravi?
He's scared of everything!
Even hot soup.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.253
He's worried it will give
his "mouthy an ouchie."

16:03.253 --> 16:04.844
Wait, but he said that
when you gave him

16:04.844 --> 16:06.676
a scarf he didn't like,
you choked him out!

16:06.676 --> 16:08.468
I was just tying it
around his neck!

16:08.468 --> 16:09.719
He said the room went dark!

16:09.719 --> 16:12.262
We were in the theater,
and the movie was starting!

16:14.394 --> 16:16.356
Wow, he is scared
of everything.

16:18.598 --> 16:20.810
Xander, next time,
just be honest with me.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.523
Okay.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.608
So, wanna come help me
color coordinate my belts?

16:28.608 --> 16:32.072
Honestly, I'd rather gouge
my eyes out
with this hideous necklace.

16:33.413 --> 16:35.705
I mean...
Yay, belts!

16:39.379 --> 16:40.500
Bye, Harold.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.462
We'll really miss you.

16:42.462 --> 16:45.505
Thank you all so much
for looking after him for me.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.508
Anything you want for
Christmas this year,
it's yours.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.181
How about having Grant
ask me out?

16:51.181 --> 16:53.973
After Grant saw Tiffany
the red-nosed freak,

16:53.973 --> 16:57.347
not even Santa
could pull off
that Christmas miracle.

16:57.347 --> 17:00.350
Ooh, nice burn, Zuri.

17:00.350 --> 17:03.523
Okay, kids, we've got to go.
See you in December!

17:03.523 --> 17:07.107
Wait. Can I have
one more minute with Harold
before he goes?

17:07.107 --> 17:10.360
Okay, but I was hoping
to get to the airport early.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.452
I don't want to get stuck
with a middle seat.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.707
I'm sorry we couldn't
get you to fly, buddy.

17:17.707 --> 17:20.710
We should not have put
so much pressure on you.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.542
It's like me and dodgeball.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.004
The pressure gets to me,
and I can't catch.

17:25.004 --> 17:27.087
But I'm awesome
when I'm playing by myself.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.430
Can you play dodgeball
by yourself?

17:30.430 --> 17:32.762
If you're Jorge,
you have no choice.

17:34.844 --> 17:36.386
I believe in you, Harold.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.518
Just don't let the pressure
get to you.

17:38.518 --> 17:42.482
And someday,
when you're ready,
you are going to fly.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.396
(GASPS)

17:46.396 --> 17:47.947
What? Do I have a boogie?

17:49.489 --> 17:51.281
No! Jorge, look!

17:53.243 --> 17:54.534
You did it, buddy!

17:54.534 --> 17:57.537
Harold, you can fly?

17:57.537 --> 18:00.290
Wow! I guess he just
needed someone

18:00.290 --> 18:02.622
who knew what
he was going through
to believe in him!

18:03.833 --> 18:07.257
Great job, Jorge.
Thank you, Santa.

18:07.257 --> 18:11.381
So, now that Harold can fly,
does that mean he gets to
go home with you?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.883
You bet!
And if he keeps practicing,

18:13.883 --> 18:17.217
maybe by this Christmas,
he'll get a spot
on my A-team!

18:17.217 --> 18:21.100
And now maybe he can fly you
back to the North Pole
on your sleigh!

18:21.100 --> 18:25.275
That would be nice,
because airport security
does not like Harold.

18:25.275 --> 18:26.936
The last time
he got a pat-down,

18:26.936 --> 18:29.359
the agent got an antler
to the jingle bells.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.994
Why did you
wake me up so early?

18:34.994 --> 18:37.157
Are we on our way to
some weird gumdrop funeral?

18:38.158 --> 18:40.620
Hardly. You are
the last person

18:40.620 --> 18:42.452
the Sugarbuttons family
would want to see.

18:43.703 --> 18:46.206
But let us move on.

18:46.206 --> 18:47.247
We have a surprise for you.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.462
ALL: Merry Christmas, Griff!

18:54.964 --> 18:57.637
You guys do know
it's summer, right?

18:57.637 --> 19:01.020
Yes, but you said
Christmas in juvie
was not so great.

19:01.020 --> 19:03.022
So we wanted to show you
what Christmas is like

19:03.022 --> 19:05.435
when you're with people
who really love you.

19:05.435 --> 19:09.689
Guys, this is awesome!
I can't believe you did
all this for me.

19:09.689 --> 19:11.901
I cannot believe
Emma bought a Christmas tree,

19:11.901 --> 19:14.984
when we are surrounded
by millions of acres
of forest.

19:14.984 --> 19:16.576
Ravi, the first time
you swung the ax,

19:16.576 --> 19:17.447
you dislocated
both shoulders.

19:19.449 --> 19:22.242
Guys, thank you all so much.

19:22.242 --> 19:23.743
I don't even know
what to say.

19:23.743 --> 19:26.586
How about,
"Let's open presents"?

19:28.668 --> 19:33.132
I want to open this,
but I just can't.

19:33.132 --> 19:38.678
Aw, he doesn't know
how to open a present.
I feel so sorry for him.

19:38.678 --> 19:43.723
I feel sorry for that
one brain cell in your head.
It must be very lonely.

19:43.723 --> 19:48.648
What I mean is,
I don't really need
a bunch of presents.

19:48.648 --> 19:50.980
You guys have already
given me everything I need.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.523
Aw, that is so sweet.

19:53.523 --> 19:56.776
And, you know,
there are a lot of other kids
like me out there.

19:56.776 --> 19:58.157
Maybe we could give
some of them

19:58.157 --> 19:59.659
an early Christmas,
like you're giving me.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.533
That is really thoughtful
of you, Griff.

20:03.533 --> 20:05.535
Yes, it is,

20:05.535 --> 20:08.207
but you might want to
keep this present.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.589
(COUGHS) Gold watch!

20:10.630 --> 20:11.631
Thanks.

20:17.046 --> 20:18.508
Merry Christmas!

20:20.390 --> 20:23.683
By the way,
where's my milk and cookies?

20:23.683 --> 20:25.515
I have no idea.

20:29.018 --> 20:31.691
Wow, I'm really impressed
you guys were able to hire

20:31.691 --> 20:34.614
a reindeer and fake Santa
on such short notice.

20:34.614 --> 20:36.446
Yeah, fake.
(CHUCKLES)

20:37.907 --> 20:39.619
Now this is
a Merry Christmas.

20:39.619 --> 20:43.663
Griff, it's so great
you invited kids from
the local reform school.

20:43.663 --> 20:46.075
Yeah, knowing we cared enough
to do this for them

20:46.075 --> 20:48.127
is the best present
they could've gotten.

20:48.127 --> 20:50.079
I mean,
besides early release.

20:51.421 --> 20:53.042
Griff, we're really
proud of you.

20:53.042 --> 20:55.505
Yeah, all these kids
look really happy.

20:57.377 --> 21:00.219
You set up
the metal detector, right?
Like, duh!

21:05.014 --> 21:08.768
It was so cool
seeing those kids'
happy faces.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.562
Yeah, it was the best
summer Christmas ever!

21:12.562 --> 21:15.775
The only thing missing
was the traditional
math test by the fire.

21:16.856 --> 21:20.530
Uh, Tiffany,
no one else does that.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.822
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, right.

21:22.822 --> 21:26.326
Next, you'll be telling me
there's no 12 days
of spelling tests.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.578
Nope.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.411
Mother!

21:33.413 --> 21:36.876
Hey, there's an
un-opened gift.

21:36.876 --> 21:39.298
Griff, it's got
your name on it.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.920
Huh? I wonder who it's from.

21:42.722 --> 21:44.303
A harmonica?

21:44.303 --> 21:47.597
I've always wanted
one of these!
Did you guys get me this?

21:47.597 --> 21:49.018
No, it wasn't us.

21:49.018 --> 21:51.641
But I never told anyone
I wanted a harmonica.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.063
(PLAYS)

21:56.105 --> 21:57.937
Merry Christmas, Griff!

21:57.937 --> 22:00.279
(GASPS) Santa Claus?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.532
Ho-ho-ho!

22:09.709 --> 22:13.252
I'll take... Tiffany.

22:13.252 --> 22:14.664
And remember...
I know.

22:14.664 --> 22:17.166
I'll pretend my mom
grounded me for
getting an A-minus.

22:18.418 --> 22:21.170
And I'll take Jorge.

22:21.170 --> 22:25.675
Yes! Second to last!
In your face, Brittany!

22:27.637 --> 22:29.228
Easy, hot shot.

22:29.228 --> 22:31.270
If we were playing soccer,
I would have picked Brittany.
