00:00.696 --> 00:02.178
Okay, as everybody knows,

00:02.303 --> 00:05.880
<i>The Spirit of Pawnee</i>
was defaced again last night.

00:06.308 --> 00:08.299
- What was it this time?
- Chocolate pudding.

00:09.245 --> 00:10.134
That's new.

00:10.302 --> 00:14.042
The mural that normally resides here
is called <i>The Spirit of Pawnee</i>,

00:14.167 --> 00:15.781
and it's very controversial.

00:15.906 --> 00:17.808
We've had someone throw acid at it,

00:18.283 --> 00:19.352
tomato sauce.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.936
Someone tried to stab it once.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.997
We really need better security here.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.876
We also need...
better, less-offensive history.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.837
So the city council has decided
it should be changed

00:31.962 --> 00:34.575
to something
a little less horrifying.

00:34.864 --> 00:36.893
Now since the murals were made

00:37.079 --> 00:39.771
by government employees
back in the 1930s,

00:40.180 --> 00:42.500
we thought it might be fun
if each department

00:42.989 --> 00:45.169
submitted the design
for a new mural...

00:45.337 --> 00:48.188
And you'll submit your concepts
tomorrow afternoon.

00:48.463 --> 00:50.963
All righty, folks?
Thank you very much.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.886
Leslie, what's your design gonna be?
A tree?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.574
Joe, you work in sewage.

00:55.699 --> 00:58.257
Your department literally
specializes in crap.

00:58.382 --> 01:00.240
- You wanna do this?
- I told you before.

01:00.365 --> 01:01.811
Crap is a slang term,

01:01.979 --> 01:03.562
and I don't like that term.

01:03.856 --> 01:07.233
But at least we don't specialize
in losing... Like you guys.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.050
Sewage, let's roll.

01:09.552 --> 01:10.444
Damn!

01:10.763 --> 01:13.114
How does sewage
always get the hottest interns?

01:43.650 --> 01:45.731
Guys, this department has the chance

01:45.856 --> 01:48.859
to design something
that could be in this building forever.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.418
This could be our legacy.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.404
I thought building a park on lot 48
was gonna be our legacy.

01:53.572 --> 01:54.710
You can have two.

01:54.835 --> 01:57.200
Look at Madonna...
Great singer, amazing arms.

01:57.325 --> 02:00.244
Look at O.J. Simpson...
Heisman trophy winner, naked gun.

02:00.824 --> 02:03.042
No offense, Leslie,
but I'm not an artist.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.458
That's not true.
I've seen your fingernails.

02:05.813 --> 02:07.727
I pay someone to do this.

02:08.037 --> 02:08.877
Really?

02:10.205 --> 02:11.737
Shoot.
Anyway...

02:12.049 --> 02:14.299
I'm ordering all of you
to design a mural.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.749
Only Ron can order
the whole department to do something.

02:17.874 --> 02:20.598
- Ron, order them to do this.
- Do whatever Leslie says.

02:27.107 --> 02:29.899
And it needs to be breathtaking
and moving and historical

02:30.622 --> 02:33.695
and better than every department,
and you have one hour.

02:34.106 --> 02:36.858
Designers, make it work.

02:37.643 --> 02:38.643
Tim Gunn.

02:40.137 --> 02:41.994
You, my friend,
are ready to go dancing.

02:42.735 --> 02:43.704
Thank you, sir.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.039
All right, next.

02:45.268 --> 02:46.832
Andrew, looking good.

02:47.154 --> 02:48.558
Business is booming.

02:49.192 --> 02:51.941
Hey, Ron, how about you?
Need a little dog waxin'?

02:52.066 --> 02:54.089
It's 5 bucks,
and you'll cut in front of him.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.424
- What?
- Beat it.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.121
This is Ron Swanson
we're talking about.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.040
I'm impressed with Andy.

03:00.165 --> 03:02.306
Pulling himself up
by his bootstraps.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.558
Reminds me of me.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.843
I got my first job when I was nine.
Worked at a sheet metal factory.

03:07.968 --> 03:10.755
In two weeks,
I was running the floor.

03:12.478 --> 03:15.128
Child labor laws
are ruining this country.

03:18.282 --> 03:21.000
- Do you have a key in your shoe?
- No, I have a bunion

03:21.125 --> 03:22.871
that's practically its own toe.

03:22.996 --> 03:26.790
Normally, the pain howls through
my loafers like a banshee on the moors,

03:26.957 --> 03:29.099
but... for these past three minutes,

03:29.266 --> 03:31.293
it's been reduced to a faint growl.

03:33.769 --> 03:34.964
That was neat.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.275
We are all finished.

03:41.507 --> 03:43.854
That was great.
Thank you, son.

03:43.979 --> 03:44.979
No sweat!

03:45.851 --> 03:46.839
Next!

03:47.368 --> 03:49.937
Shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
It's not good business.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.056
You know what else
isn't good business?

03:52.712 --> 03:54.800
- That guy's my friend.
- Right.

03:55.558 --> 03:56.708
I'm saying...

03:56.833 --> 03:58.618
You shouldn't
let your friends cut in line.

03:58.743 --> 04:00.322
Sorry, kyle.
Here, give me this.

04:01.413 --> 04:02.324
Next!

04:02.807 --> 04:05.077
So what are you looking for exactly?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.564
I don't know, man.

04:06.786 --> 04:09.286
The spirit of Pawnee.
That's all I got.

04:10.156 --> 04:12.360
Here. Just gimme $20 worth of art.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.546
Just something that seems personal
that only I could have done.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.488
- Well, tell me about yourself.
- No. Just paint.

04:20.087 --> 04:22.728
I have no interest in art.
Let me clarify.

04:22.895 --> 04:25.728
I have no interest
in non-nude images.

04:26.814 --> 04:28.747
Dude, what the hell
kind of art is this?

04:28.872 --> 04:30.743
Looks like a lizard
puking up skittles!

04:30.868 --> 04:32.688
I'm an abstract expressionist.

04:32.856 --> 04:36.044
No, you're a con artist,
and I'm a guy that's out 20 bucks.

04:36.694 --> 04:37.628
Whatever.

04:37.753 --> 04:39.153
I'm a terrible artist.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.450
But the Parks department
has done so much for me

04:41.575 --> 04:44.264
that if I can help them out
in any way, I will.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.420
Oh, God.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.960
Maybe I should just give them
all free flu shots.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.293
I know everything about
this town and these murals,

04:53.418 --> 04:56.348
and that's why this is
a dream come true... Literally.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.215
I have had a dream
where I designed a mural.

04:59.486 --> 05:02.817
But then it turned into a nightmare
because the mural started talking,

05:02.942 --> 05:05.677
and it came alive, it was whispering,
and I couldn't hear what it was saying,

05:05.802 --> 05:07.858
so I leaned in close,
and then it ate me.

05:08.494 --> 05:10.894
At one point,
Gina Gershon was there.

05:11.614 --> 05:15.114
My piece is truly
gonna capture the spirit of Pawnee.

05:20.061 --> 05:22.535
Never understood
the term elbow grease.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.835
I guess it's not really grease.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.512
Just hard work.

05:30.271 --> 05:33.428
- Nice shiny shoes you got there.
- I was just...

05:34.214 --> 05:35.497
Oh, no... Shoot.

05:35.823 --> 05:37.878
Actually, it looks like
I scuffed this one.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.289
Do you need your money back?
'Cause I already spent it.

05:42.414 --> 05:43.864
Really?
How did...

05:44.793 --> 05:45.875
Never mind.

05:46.200 --> 05:49.242
I think I'll just take
another full polish.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.390
Can I cut in line again?

05:51.515 --> 05:53.394
I feel right at home as a shoeshine.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.043
I have no idea what I'm doing,

05:55.168 --> 05:58.388
but I know I'm doing it
really, really well.

05:59.301 --> 06:02.028
Okay, let's get goin'
with the spirit of Pawnee.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.958
- Ann, you go first.
- Okay.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.536
Since it's the Parks department,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.969
I thought I would design
a pretty park.

06:13.278 --> 06:16.711
With, uh, dogs playing.
I can't really draw,

06:16.836 --> 06:19.536
so I just cut some stuff
out of a magazine.

06:20.081 --> 06:23.299
That looks like something a death row
convict would make in art therapy.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.301
Dude, I tried.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.069
And you failed.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.189
It's dogs and people
playing in a park.

06:29.314 --> 06:31.372
- It's cute!
- It's okay, sweetheart.

06:31.497 --> 06:33.889
You can't make art
because you are art.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.678
You're beautiful...
But that sucks.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.023
Let's see yours!

06:39.191 --> 06:42.331
Fine. Mine is amazing.
It's gonna blow your mind.

06:49.131 --> 06:51.160
Some professional-ass
art right here.

06:51.341 --> 06:54.626
- I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
- It's abstract, Leslie.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.260
Over here, you got some shapes.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.793
And then you come
over to this side...

07:00.951 --> 07:03.701
You know, it's actually
kind of interesting.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.058
Each shape is its own thing...

07:06.731 --> 07:08.302
But then when it comes together,

07:09.687 --> 07:11.305
it really gives you a sense of...

07:13.743 --> 07:14.860
completion.

07:17.299 --> 07:20.599
A piece of art caused me
to have an emotional reaction.

07:20.794 --> 07:22.044
Is that normal?

07:22.901 --> 07:24.727
So it's the last supper

07:24.852 --> 07:26.946
but with famous people from Indiana.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.712
John Mellancamp, Larry Bird,

07:30.837 --> 07:32.306
Michael Jackson,

07:32.786 --> 07:35.454
David Letterman, Vivica A. Fox.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.998
Okay, so here's where
it gets a little dicey,

07:38.166 --> 07:42.321
'cause there's not that many celebrities
from Indiana, so... a NASCAR,

07:43.291 --> 07:46.745
my friend Becky, Ron Swanson...

07:47.906 --> 07:49.343
Who's the Jesus?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.361
That would be Greg Kinnear.

07:51.941 --> 07:55.319
- I didn't know he was from Indiana.
- Yeah, you know, I read that he was.

07:55.444 --> 07:57.619
Do you think
he's the best choice for Jesus?

07:57.744 --> 07:59.065
He was great on <i>ER</i>...

07:59.190 --> 08:01.188
- Greg Kinnear wasn't in <i>ER</i>.
- Yeah, he was.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.856
I don't think that he was.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.481
Who am I thinking of?

08:06.304 --> 08:07.444
Okay. Next.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.526
Really good, Jerry.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.412
For my murinal,

08:16.580 --> 08:18.636
I was inspired
by the death of my grandma...

08:18.761 --> 08:20.211
You said "murinal".

08:21.420 --> 08:24.044
- No, I didn't.
- You said "murinal". I heard it.

08:24.262 --> 08:25.838
- Anyway, she...
- Jerry...

08:26.006 --> 08:27.989
Why don't you put that murinal
in the men's room

08:28.114 --> 08:30.634
so people can murinate all over it?

08:32.136 --> 08:35.304
Go to the doctor. You might have
a murinary tract infection.

08:35.924 --> 08:39.017
- Just wanted to show you my art.
- Murinal, murinal, murinal!

08:39.846 --> 08:41.395
Disqualified!

08:42.841 --> 08:44.191
It's pointillism.

08:44.672 --> 08:47.568
And each dot is a photo
of a citizen of the town.

08:48.371 --> 08:50.490
No one cares.
At all.

08:52.629 --> 08:55.145
So this is a multimedia project.

08:55.367 --> 08:56.341
First...

08:56.697 --> 08:58.579
A bunch of rats made out of garbage.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.305
And...

09:00.624 --> 09:01.739
This is a tv screen.

09:01.864 --> 09:03.609
It'll be like a big flat screen tv,

09:03.734 --> 09:05.982
and it'll play looped video
of knee surgeries.

09:06.107 --> 09:09.965
And this is a human-sized hamster wheel
that will be next to the mural,

09:10.163 --> 09:12.048
if we can get one,
and it'll be spinning,

09:12.173 --> 09:14.155
and there'll be like
a fat guy in it all the time

09:14.280 --> 09:17.055
like screaming and like eating
raw beef and like bleeding,

09:17.383 --> 09:19.600
and like blood will come
out of his mouth and stuff.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.734
And that'll be like right next to...

09:23.325 --> 09:24.392
the mural.

09:24.893 --> 09:26.347
I have one question.

09:26.952 --> 09:27.823
Why?

09:28.447 --> 09:30.277
If you have to ask,
you don't get it.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.863
I don't think
they really got the assignment.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.516
If we're gonna beatthe others,

09:34.641 --> 09:37.952
we have to choose something that
will stand the test of time...

09:38.119 --> 09:39.519
Like the Mona Lisa

09:40.119 --> 09:41.696
or the music of Squeeze.

09:44.078 --> 09:45.959
June 8, 1922.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.462
The Pawnee bread factory
burned to the ground.

09:48.852 --> 09:51.034
We lost a lot of good bread
that day...

09:51.159 --> 09:53.259
As well as several human lives.

09:54.405 --> 09:56.553
And it also made the whole town
smell like toast,

09:57.024 --> 10:00.445
which one resident described
as "disturbingly enticing".

10:00.570 --> 10:01.600
But I digress.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.552
The point is, we rebuilt Pawnee

10:03.677 --> 10:05.479
to the wonderful town
that it is today.

10:06.012 --> 10:08.441
Why would you want a mural
that shows people dying

10:08.566 --> 10:10.740
when you could have shapes
that come alive?

10:10.865 --> 10:14.121
Because it's the most famous event
in our town's history,

10:14.246 --> 10:16.865
and people love voting for tragedy.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.944
Look at the oscars.
This is our holocaust movie.

10:20.991 --> 10:22.761
This is our <i>English Patient</i>.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.666
Sounds like you're
exploiting the tragedy.

10:25.854 --> 10:27.204
See? Ann gets it.

10:27.561 --> 10:28.987
Time to vote, everybody.

10:29.259 --> 10:30.410
Cast your votes!

10:30.535 --> 10:34.341
May the best,
most tragic project win.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.008
When we started this,
we were six different voices

10:37.133 --> 10:38.762
with six ideas for a mural.

10:39.465 --> 10:42.288
And then those six voices
came together as a team.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.407
There are no losers today.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.376
But there is one winner.

10:46.501 --> 10:47.303
Us.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.431
The Parks Department.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.017
Tom, the results
of the vote, please.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.112
One to one to one
to one to one to one.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.198
We all voted
for ourselves, didn't we?

11:05.187 --> 11:06.587
Third time, today.

11:09.158 --> 11:10.794
That's a good shoeshine.

11:32.095 --> 11:33.852
What the ****, man?

11:34.709 --> 11:36.559
I don't know what happened.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.238
Frankly.

11:38.716 --> 11:39.906
I emitted a noise.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.705
The noise was involuntary.

11:46.101 --> 11:48.851
Sometimes a sound
is just a sound, you know?

11:50.793 --> 11:54.212
We need to whittle these down.
Can we all agree on eliminating

11:54.380 --> 11:56.673
- any of these designs?
- Ann's blows.

11:56.937 --> 11:58.258
Don't hold back.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.303
It's a giant picture of a park.
That's not art.

12:01.746 --> 12:04.598
At least it's not a fat human hamster
eating meat.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.808
- You don't work here!
- You both have a point.

12:07.568 --> 12:09.956
Ann, yours was a little trite.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.750
And, April, yours was hellish
and might make someone vomit.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.549
There's something about those shapes.
There's some emotional art right there.

12:19.674 --> 12:21.857
- Any kid could do that.
- No kid could do that!

12:21.982 --> 12:23.325
Only god could do that!

12:23.493 --> 12:25.489
What is so great about the shapes?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.580
He likes the shapes, okay?
And he's part of the team.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.398
So here, take these scissors
and cut out your favorite shapes.

12:32.589 --> 12:35.617
And then we'll put them
on a new team mural.

12:37.111 --> 12:38.895
We're gonna make a new design

12:39.020 --> 12:42.219
that takes the best parts
of all of our designs.

12:42.719 --> 12:44.953
It's like if you got Michelangelo

12:45.078 --> 12:46.504
and Andy Warhol

12:46.629 --> 12:50.222
and Jackson Pollock
and Jim Davis from Garfield

12:50.347 --> 12:51.797
to do one painting.

12:52.704 --> 12:54.731
Imagine how good
that painting would be!

12:58.734 --> 13:00.484
I think it's really good.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.090
I'll be right back.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.577
We need you for something.

13:09.702 --> 13:11.957
Can it wait?
I am so swamped here.

13:12.651 --> 13:14.001
Ann's in trouble.

13:14.580 --> 13:15.961
We think it might be pills.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.087
- What?
- No.

13:17.735 --> 13:18.672
That's a lie.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.259
But this is as important.
Look at a piece of art.

13:23.633 --> 13:24.633
God.

13:26.490 --> 13:27.431
What is that?

13:28.007 --> 13:30.309
This is our entry
for the mural contest.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.019
We couldn't decide on one design,
so we took parts

13:33.187 --> 13:36.077
that we all liked of our designs
and then we just kind of...

13:36.457 --> 13:38.538
smooshed it into a thing.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.486
You made a camel.

13:43.278 --> 13:44.785
You've never heard that saying?

13:44.910 --> 13:47.701
A camel is actually a horse
designed by a committee,

13:47.869 --> 13:49.327
and what you guys have here

13:49.495 --> 13:50.995
is one ugly camel...

13:51.964 --> 13:53.564
featuring Bill Paxton.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.367
- Greg Kinnear.
- Right.

13:55.492 --> 13:57.210
Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.963
You have to save us.
You have to design something.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.674
- Leslie, I'm not an artist.
- Yes, you are.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.784
I've seen you sketch things.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.720
Like poles for stop signs.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.597
That everybody stops and looks at.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.390
By law, they're required to.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.435
Please. You're the only one of us
who's got any talent.

14:13.865 --> 14:15.645
I know you'll do something good.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.773
And I really want to win this.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.917
Please?
What are you gonna do tonight?

14:20.042 --> 14:22.027
I was gonna go to Arby's
and watch <i>Frontline</i>.

14:29.553 --> 14:30.603
Here we go.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.705
So, it is an old man

14:36.127 --> 14:37.873
feeding pigeons in a park.

14:39.116 --> 14:40.754
The spirit of Pawnee, maybe?

14:40.922 --> 14:43.536
- You gotta be kidding me.
- How is that better than mine?

14:43.661 --> 14:45.491
It isn't.
And that's saying something.

14:45.616 --> 14:47.766
And who's the man?
Is he famous?

14:48.186 --> 14:49.686
Is it Martin Landau?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.766
I have no dog in this fight.
I'm just saying that this will win.

14:53.427 --> 14:55.177
It's nothing.
It's mush!

14:55.365 --> 14:57.774
There's not even one shape in there!
Where are the shapes?

14:57.899 --> 14:59.481
I'm not saying this is any good.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.411
I'm saying that this'll win.
It's mass appeal. It's like

15:02.536 --> 15:03.986
what motels put up,

15:04.487 --> 15:08.237
and it hangs there for years,
and no one ever throws acid at it.

15:08.653 --> 15:10.992
- Who did this? I like it.
- Seriously?

15:12.662 --> 15:13.521
Sorry!

15:14.791 --> 15:15.872
It comforts me.

15:18.136 --> 15:19.084
That'll win.

15:20.232 --> 15:21.322
This is...

15:22.231 --> 15:24.192
garbage!
We've gotta go back to the shapes.

15:24.317 --> 15:26.437
This is boring.
Go back to the garbage.

15:26.562 --> 15:28.635
I would take the shapes over this.
Come on!

15:28.808 --> 15:32.241
I wouldn't take them over anything.
I'd take Jerry's Murinal over this.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.416
No, guys...

15:34.142 --> 15:35.546
- This is the one.
- What?

15:35.671 --> 15:36.878
Sorry. Mark's right.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.104
This is an outrage!
He's not  in the department.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.189
- Neither is Ann.
- But Ann's hot.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.411
And that counts.

15:42.536 --> 15:44.696
Whatever happened to,
"we're the parks department.

15:44.821 --> 15:47.070
"Rah, rah, rah.
Down with the Sewage Department"?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.781
We spent all day here for no reason!

15:49.949 --> 15:52.367
We have a reason! We're gonna win!
That's our reason!

15:52.535 --> 15:55.485
Our designs are not gonna win.
Mark's might win!

15:55.873 --> 15:57.455
How great would it be if we won.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.541
You'll feel a lot better,
I promise you,

15:59.709 --> 16:01.780
after you win.
We're going with this one.

16:02.145 --> 16:04.337
I'll see you
at the presentation tomorrow.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.132
That is an order, team.
Go, team!

16:08.775 --> 16:09.759
Team dismissed.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.305
Yes, we are a team,
but I am the team leader.

16:13.629 --> 16:15.429
So I made a bold decision.

16:15.669 --> 16:17.264
We're playing it safe.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.029
How's life
in the Parks De-fart-ment?

16:29.197 --> 16:31.656
Better than life
in the Sewage De-fart-ment.

16:31.781 --> 16:33.963
- Which makes more sense.
- Whatever!

16:34.702 --> 16:35.847
You are screwed.

16:35.972 --> 16:37.322
Get used to this.

16:38.776 --> 16:41.458
Because it's gonna be hanging on
the wall, right outside your door

16:41.799 --> 16:44.169
for the next 100 years!

16:48.569 --> 16:49.758
That was pretty good.

16:50.312 --> 16:52.061
You think they're gonna win?

16:52.629 --> 16:55.472
They went super-patriotic.
It's a classic mistake.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.738
It seems crowd-pleasing,
but it's a stance.

16:57.863 --> 17:00.477
And there's always someone
who'll oppose a stance.

17:01.006 --> 17:01.811
Us...

17:02.185 --> 17:04.585
Old man feeding pigeons...
No stance.

17:05.039 --> 17:07.150
Absolutely no point of view
whatsoever.

17:08.311 --> 17:09.903
No point of view.
Smart.

17:12.296 --> 17:13.796
I haven't been back.

17:14.462 --> 17:16.862
I wish him good luck
in his business.

17:17.744 --> 17:20.246
And, yes,
I will absolutely go back

17:20.579 --> 17:23.165
to get my shoes shined soon.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.003
I don't frankly see

17:26.128 --> 17:28.779
why this is a topic for discussion.

17:45.474 --> 17:46.474
What's up?

17:50.030 --> 17:51.980
You know the thing?

17:53.017 --> 17:55.767
- The other day?
- Other day... Other day...

17:56.450 --> 17:57.450
Yesterday?

17:57.727 --> 17:58.727
I am...

17:59.575 --> 18:00.537
That was...

18:01.368 --> 18:03.918
I'm okay.
You know, I'd be okay if we...

18:05.668 --> 18:07.752
If we never mentioned it again.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.463
Never mentioned what?

18:12.027 --> 18:14.132
The moan.
The weird moan you made

18:14.257 --> 18:16.344
that was super-weird?
Do you not remember that?

18:16.512 --> 18:18.847
I talked about it with the lady
who went after for 1/2 hour.

18:19.172 --> 18:21.057
She said she thought
it was an animal...

18:22.351 --> 18:24.151
It was just an odd moment.

18:24.276 --> 18:26.676
Let's just not
talk about it anymore.

18:27.057 --> 18:28.770
That's what I was trying to say.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.377
But, yeah... Okay.

18:31.027 --> 18:31.985
Good job.

18:40.283 --> 18:41.953
- Miss Knope.
- Chief Konner.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.288
What do you got?

18:43.944 --> 18:47.194
Well, we aren't really artists,
but we gave it a shot.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.728
It's your basic dogs playing poker,

18:49.853 --> 18:52.297
but,
with an everything's-on-fire theme.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.115
This is my nephew over here.

18:55.488 --> 18:59.095
And this is an attractive lady
with a hamburger for a head.

18:59.365 --> 19:00.930
Just some stuff we like.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.308
Anyway, we had a lot of fun
putting it together.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.019
Good luck!

19:14.523 --> 19:16.023
- Go ahead.
- What?

19:17.266 --> 19:19.016
The camel's way more fun.

19:20.812 --> 19:22.118
I want my team back.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.661
And my team made this

19:24.093 --> 19:25.693
hot, crazy camel mess.

19:26.286 --> 19:28.166
So this is what we're gonna submit,

19:28.334 --> 19:29.751
even if it means we lose.

19:30.184 --> 19:32.837
God, I hope we win.
But we're definitely gonna lose.

19:33.005 --> 19:33.971
Probably.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.482
And Ann!
How Ann gets it done!

19:39.471 --> 19:40.471
Let's go!

19:47.442 --> 19:48.603
What are the shapes?

19:48.778 --> 19:51.282
The shapes are awesome,
is what they are.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.649
You can't handle it.

19:52.817 --> 19:53.942
No, I like them.

19:54.678 --> 19:55.568
Forgive me.

19:56.015 --> 19:57.320
Is that Michael Jackson?

19:58.906 --> 20:01.866
- The pride of Indiana.
- That's right. So it's relevant.

20:02.069 --> 20:03.201
Who is he carrying?

20:03.523 --> 20:04.973
Jesus Greg Kinnear.

20:05.421 --> 20:09.082
It looks like he's carrying Kinnear
into the burning building.

20:10.039 --> 20:12.362
That's because he's <i>moonwalking</i>.

20:13.043 --> 20:14.043
So he...

20:14.928 --> 20:16.928
Should be goin' the other way.

20:17.472 --> 20:18.925
That did not occur to me.

20:22.780 --> 20:24.597
- Sorry.
- So there you go.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.315
The spirit of Pawnee.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.017
We didn't win.

20:28.339 --> 20:30.023
But neither did anyone else.

20:30.148 --> 20:33.231
They realized it was gonna cost
a ton of money, to hire a muralist.

20:33.508 --> 20:35.649
So they're just gonna restore
the old one.

20:35.774 --> 20:38.924
They're changing the title
to the diversity express.

20:44.740 --> 20:45.890
Look at that.

20:48.135 --> 20:51.749
- It's not as good as the other one.
- I don't know what you mean by good?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.032
Neither do i!

20:53.157 --> 20:54.657
Just do another one!

20:54.792 --> 20:57.788
I have actual assignments
that I have to finish for art school.

20:57.913 --> 21:00.133
Shut up and do more art for me.

21:02.892 --> 21:04.292
This one's racist.

21:05.363 --> 21:06.613
It's beautiful.

21:08.706 --> 21:11.256
I've looked at this
for five hours, now.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.806
I like the green one
and the red circle right here.

21:21.873 --> 21:23.373
I'm tearing up, man.

21:24.305 --> 21:30.460
