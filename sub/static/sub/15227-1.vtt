01:19.479 --> 01:21.679
(laughter)

01:21.748 --> 01:24.282
Here is your
lunch, my Latka.

01:28.988 --> 01:32.423
Now I will go to make
our apartment a home

01:32.492 --> 01:34.492
and watch Richard Simmons

01:34.561 --> 01:38.930
 so my body will be lean
 and supple for your return.

01:40.266 --> 01:44.903
I shall fly through my day
knowing what awaits me. 

01:46.640 --> 01:48.573
And I shall puke my guts out... 

01:50.544 --> 01:52.644
...if you don't knock it off.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.513
Louie is angry

01:55.582 --> 01:59.684
 because he does not
have what we have.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.686
A green card?

02:03.423 --> 02:07.625
He needs somebody to love.

02:07.693 --> 02:09.759
 Get out of here with the...

02:11.098 --> 02:14.733
And soon, he will have somebody.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.801
 You all will.
ALEX:
Hey,

02:16.870 --> 02:18.336
 what's this all about? 

02:18.405 --> 02:21.906
 Okay, please,
 listen very carefully. 

02:21.975 --> 02:23.741
It's difficult to explain.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.177
Wow. Sounds 
serious.

02:26.245 --> 02:27.579
 It is. 

02:27.647 --> 02:32.216
 I'm going to tell you
about the <i> shloogel.</i>

02:32.285 --> 02:34.352
(Alex laughs)

02:34.421 --> 02:36.154
<i> Shloogel.</i>

02:36.222 --> 02:37.521
(laughs)

02:39.358 --> 02:43.094
The <i> shloogel</i> is one
 of our most sacred traditions. 

02:43.162 --> 02:44.062
Oh. 

02:44.130 --> 02:45.530
Don't laugh again.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.936
A <i> shloogel</i> is the ceremony

02:52.005 --> 02:57.008
where a newly married couple
shares their elation

02:57.077 --> 03:00.511
 by introducing 
 their closest friends

03:00.580 --> 03:03.881
to the man or woman
so perfect for them

03:03.950 --> 03:06.084
that they will fall so in love, 

03:06.152 --> 03:09.053
 they will never want to part.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.255
Oh. 
(laughs)

03:11.324 --> 03:13.391
Sounds like a
group blind date.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.593
(Alex laughs)

03:14.661 --> 03:16.928
 It's not a blind date, Reiger. 

03:16.996 --> 03:19.464
Okay.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.933
It's nothing 
like a blind date.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.234
Right.

03:23.303 --> 03:27.239
 I have been looking for people 
for two months now,

03:27.307 --> 03:30.575
 and I have found them. 

03:30.644 --> 03:34.879
Oh, I have such a wonderful man 
for you, Elaine.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.414
Yes! And Louie? 

03:36.483 --> 03:37.582
Yeah?

03:37.651 --> 03:38.782
Perfect.

03:38.851 --> 03:39.951
Yeah?

03:40.020 --> 03:43.388
Tony, wait till you see her.

03:43.456 --> 03:44.956
Ooh, ooh!

03:45.025 --> 03:48.693
Surprise, surprise, Jim.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.463
And Alex... 

03:51.531 --> 03:52.997
 Now hold it
right there.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.732
You sound very
sure of yourself.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.969
 Well, like many people 
from my country,

03:58.038 --> 04:01.372
I am born with the gift 
to match people.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.008
 Comes to us naturally
as eating,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.511
sleeping
and disemboweling sheep.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.816
I'm free.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.050
I'm there.
I'm going.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.351
Hey. Great.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.353
I'll go if
Alex goes.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.255
I'm not going.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.391
Well, I sure am.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.125
I'm not gonna
pass this up.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.493
That's it.
I'm going.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.095
Alex, what are you
 talking about? 

04:24.164 --> 04:25.262
You got to go.
It'll be fun.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.431
 (overlapping chatter)

04:26.499 --> 04:27.598
 Come on, I don't want
 to go! 

04:27.667 --> 04:28.800
 No, I'm sorry, 

04:28.868 --> 04:30.101
but, uh, in this country,

04:30.170 --> 04:32.237
there are still a few of us
 who believe in romance 

04:32.306 --> 04:34.372
 and chance encounters
and that old black magic.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.707
And, yes, I like to think
of myself as someone

04:36.776 --> 04:40.045
who will fight any tradition
 that denies individual choice. 

04:40.113 --> 04:43.014
(speaking native language)

04:43.083 --> 04:45.450
See, this shows 
how good Simka is.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.453
That's exactly
what your date said.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.689
She did?

04:51.758 --> 04:53.257
(speaking native language)

04:53.326 --> 04:55.326
Be there
or be square.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.836
Everybody take
a load off. 

05:09.976 --> 05:12.176
 Now the introductions. 

05:12.245 --> 05:13.478
SIMKA:
Hey.

05:13.546 --> 05:14.879
(clears throat) 

05:14.948 --> 05:18.850
Tony Banta, 
this is Vicki Destefano.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.085
Tony, describe for us,
if you will...

05:21.153 --> 05:22.287
How you doing?

05:22.355 --> 05:24.188
...your perfect woman.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.725
Well, blond,
feminine, leggy.

05:27.794 --> 05:30.094
But who cares
about looks?

05:30.162 --> 05:32.097
I mean, uh...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.466
 No. Look... Who
cares about looks?

05:35.535 --> 05:37.268
Oh, the most
important thing is

05:37.337 --> 05:40.004
that they have a
great personality.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.407
Vicki, now you describe 
your perfect man.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.776
It ain't
this meatball.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.547
What was that
supposed to mean?

05:49.616 --> 05:50.715
You heard me.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.383
Yeah, I know I
heard you, but...

05:52.452 --> 05:57.121
Now there will be plenty of time
for that later. 

06:00.593 --> 06:02.994
All right, now Elaine Nardo,

06:03.063 --> 06:05.930
this is Arnie Ross.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.498
Hello. How do you do?

06:07.566 --> 06:11.402
Elaine, we know that you
usually date the type

06:11.470 --> 06:13.270
that's hard to catch.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.139
 You know, lady killers,

06:15.208 --> 06:17.475
 handsome rogues
who can wrap women

06:17.543 --> 06:19.777
around their
little finger.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.214
 So they found you one. 

06:29.989 --> 06:32.123
You are next, Jim.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.424
Oh, finally.

06:33.492 --> 06:34.959
LATKA:
Hey, Jim,

06:35.028 --> 06:38.229
what is your all-time
favorite TV comedy show?

06:38.298 --> 06:39.530
Oh, that's easy.

06:39.599 --> 06:42.100
Uh,<i> The Bob Newhart Show.</i>

06:46.672 --> 06:48.672
Are you a fan of <i> The Bob...?</i>

06:52.712 --> 06:54.645
Oh! 

06:58.184 --> 07:00.050
Oh! 

07:00.119 --> 07:04.322
Why, you're Carol,
played by Marcia Wallace.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.457
And-And you're...?

07:06.526 --> 07:09.193
Jim Ignatowski
as himself. 

07:11.498 --> 07:14.565
I bet you're curious
how we got a such a big star

07:14.634 --> 07:17.669
like Marcia Wallace 
for you, Jim.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.870
I'm curious.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.437
I'm mystified.

07:20.506 --> 07:21.773
Tell him, Marcia.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.141
I wanted a date.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.112
 Louie De Palma,

07:28.181 --> 07:29.947
 this is Judy Griffith. 

07:30.016 --> 07:31.148
 (sighs)

07:31.217 --> 07:32.550
Very nice
to meet you.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.019
Very nice to meet you.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.237
How come my date's blind?

07:53.305 --> 07:55.006
Glaucoma.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.675
Oh, you-you think that
Simka picked a blind girl

07:57.743 --> 07:59.543
so she could
not see you?

08:01.647 --> 08:04.982
The thought did cross my mind.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.585
You may be right.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.161
All right, Alex Reiger, 

08:17.230 --> 08:18.663
 Susan McDaniel.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.264
Hi.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.433
Hi. 

08:22.502 --> 08:24.001
What are you doing, Latka?

08:24.070 --> 08:26.370
Uh, I'm going to write down
the first words 

08:26.439 --> 08:28.406
you say to each other so in case

08:28.475 --> 08:30.841
you want to repeat them 
 to your grandchildren. 

08:30.910 --> 08:32.842
 Hello, grandchildren.

08:36.749 --> 08:37.847
Simka?

08:37.917 --> 08:39.049
 What?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.217
Great <i> shloogel!</i> 

08:40.285 --> 08:42.219
I know.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.190
¶ Love ¶

08:46.259 --> 08:50.261
¶ Exciting and new ¶

08:50.330 --> 08:53.631
¶ Come aboard ¶ 

08:53.699 --> 08:58.636
¶ We're expecting you ¶ 

08:58.704 --> 09:02.706
¶ And love ¶

09:02.775 --> 09:05.209
 ¶ Life's sweetest reward... ¶

09:10.250 --> 09:12.583
That's a... that's a
pretty outfit you got on.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.118
Thank you.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.153
Who picked it
out for you?

09:16.222 --> 09:19.523
I made it myself.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.125
(laughs)

09:21.194 --> 09:21.993
No, I'm serious.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.461
(laughs)

09:23.529 --> 09:26.029
What a wise-ass.

09:26.098 --> 09:29.833
Blind people can do 
all sorts of things.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.035
Archery?

09:31.104 --> 09:32.269
(laughs)

09:32.338 --> 09:35.406
(laughs)

09:35.474 --> 09:38.342
I think I may like you, Louie.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.510
Oh, yeah?

09:39.578 --> 09:40.845
Yeah.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.247
 When will you know?

09:43.316 --> 09:44.982
When I decide

09:45.051 --> 09:47.017
whether you're acting this way
because you sense

09:47.086 --> 09:50.955
that I hate to be pitied,
or you're just gross.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.957
(laughs)

10:01.267 --> 10:02.734
Well, maybe it would help

10:02.802 --> 10:05.369
if you told me a little 
something about yourself.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.905
Well, there's not
much to tell.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.907
At the moment, uh,

10:09.976 --> 10:12.576
I'm sitting here, uh,

10:12.645 --> 10:16.580
picturing you, uh, naked.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.884
 What?

10:19.953 --> 10:22.486
You know, I have never
 said anything like that

10:22.555 --> 10:25.522
in my entire life,
but I made up my mind

10:25.591 --> 10:27.624
 that tonight, I was not
 gonna pussy-foot around

10:27.693 --> 10:29.493
like I always do and
 then go home afterwards

10:29.562 --> 10:31.762
 and think about all the
 things that I should have said.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.497
At least, if I'm
gonna strike out,

10:33.566 --> 10:36.000
I'm gonna go
down fighting.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.902
So, good night and
thank you very much.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.371
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait. No, no, no.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.739
Sit down.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.107
Oh, good.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.109
You're gonna
prolong my agony.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.512
Ah, come on.

10:48.581 --> 10:54.452
Just do that laugh you did
on the Christmas show.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.922
When there was eggnog
in the water cooler?

10:57.990 --> 11:00.525
 Oh, all right. 

11:00.593 --> 11:02.859
Uh, remember,
you were drunk. 

11:02.928 --> 11:04.328
Mm.

11:04.396 --> 11:06.464
(laughing)

11:07.567 --> 11:08.932
 Ah!

11:09.001 --> 11:11.903
And you never won an Emmy?

11:14.440 --> 11:17.074
Hey, what's it to you
how I drink my beer?

11:17.143 --> 11:19.410
Hey, I don't care how
you drink your beer.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.912
Drink it any
way you like.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.780
I just thought
it, uh...

11:22.849 --> 11:25.249
it didn't look
very ladylike.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.052
How come every slob 
who manages 

11:28.121 --> 11:30.620
to wipe the spit off his face
thinks he knows 

11:30.689 --> 11:32.623
how a lady should act?

11:34.727 --> 11:36.393
What are you smiling about? 

11:36.462 --> 11:38.395
You remind me
of my mom.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.833
What kind of a
 childhood did you have?

11:42.902 --> 11:44.969
Nice.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.737
And you loved your mother
and father?

11:46.806 --> 11:49.206
I loved my parents.

11:49.274 --> 11:51.075
And you had a great relationship
 with your brother and sister?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.410
 Right. 
(laughs)

11:52.479 --> 11:54.845
And half the football team.

11:56.448 --> 11:58.049
Oh, just kidding.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.750
Oh. 
Just having 
a little fun.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.018
(laughs)

12:01.087 --> 12:02.419
You're wonderful.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.587
You're absolutely
wonderful.
Oh. 

12:03.656 --> 12:05.556
 She's absolutely wonderful.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.526
You know, you haven't told me
anything about yourself.

12:08.594 --> 12:09.726
Yes, I have.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.029
I told you all about how
ineffectual I am with women.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.797
(chuckling):
Oh. 

12:13.866 --> 12:16.367
No, but I haven't told
you the one thing

12:16.436 --> 12:18.669
 that makes women really
come running after me

12:18.738 --> 12:20.538
like pussycats in
 a tuna factory.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.772
(chuckles)

12:21.841 --> 12:22.773
 Oh, I know.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.242
It's because you
 listen so well 

12:24.310 --> 12:28.078
and because you're genuinely
concerned for children. 

12:28.147 --> 12:31.315
No, it's because
I'm incredibly rich.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.252
Hot dog, huh, honey?

12:35.321 --> 12:36.921
I think it's terrible
that you think

12:36.989 --> 12:40.558
money is the reason 
women respond to you.

12:40.627 --> 12:43.027
Believe it or not, I have been
having a lovely time tonight

12:43.096 --> 12:45.128
because you are so, uh--

12:45.197 --> 12:49.867
y-you seem so decent
an-and unusual a-and dear

12:49.936 --> 12:52.036
and because...

12:52.105 --> 12:53.671
Woody Allen 
has conditioned us

12:53.740 --> 12:57.542
to reevaluate our concept
of male beauty. 

12:59.646 --> 13:01.879
 You seem to be saying
that you, you like me...

13:01.947 --> 13:03.080
Yes.
 ...for myself. 

13:03.149 --> 13:05.082
Yes, that's right.
Irrespective of the money.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.250
Absolutely.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.386
Good, because I lied
about the money.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.988
Arnie!

13:11.056 --> 13:13.457
 I don't want to
 embarrass you, but, uh,

13:13.526 --> 13:15.492
I think you're fantastic.

13:15.561 --> 13:18.562
I mean, you're not
only beautiful...

13:18.630 --> 13:21.532
you act like you don't even
 know you're beautiful. 

13:22.635 --> 13:25.102
You know,
somehow I, uh,

13:25.171 --> 13:27.771
I forgot what it was to feel

13:27.840 --> 13:31.742
the way I feel now
about meeting somebody new.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.846
What a difference a couple
of hours can make, huh? 

13:35.915 --> 13:38.516
 Suddenly I'm afraid of dying.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.518
Thank you.

13:41.587 --> 13:46.156
That's... that's always nice
to hear.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.092
(laughs)

13:48.161 --> 13:51.195
(laughs) 

13:51.264 --> 13:53.397
You're wonderful,
you're wonderful.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.533
She is absolute-- abso--

13:55.602 --> 13:57.335
You're absolutely wonderful.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.503
True, I-I can't really
enjoy a painting,

13:59.572 --> 14:02.206
but I have
a greater enjoyment of things

14:02.275 --> 14:04.375
that appeal 
to the other senses--

14:04.444 --> 14:09.046
listening to music, 
eating fine food, making love.

14:09.115 --> 14:12.683
 Whoo.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.018
Oh, you assumed 
because I'm blind

14:14.087 --> 14:15.018
that I'm not interested 

14:15.087 --> 14:17.788
in what other women 
are interested in.

14:17.856 --> 14:20.057
N-No, I meant "whoo,"

14:20.125 --> 14:23.361
 like when a guy
hits the jackpot.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.497
More wine?

14:27.566 --> 14:28.566
Ah, no thanks.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.168
I'll just finish
what I have in my glass.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.938
 Oh, okay.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.212
(chuckles)

14:42.281 --> 14:44.314
Good ears,
good ears.

14:46.251 --> 14:52.823
 How come, out of 142
<i> Bob Newhart Show</i> episodes, 

14:52.892 --> 14:55.659
covering the years
1972-78...

14:55.728 --> 14:59.797
(clearing throat)

14:59.866 --> 15:03.133
...only 39 stories
were about you? 

15:03.202 --> 15:05.402
Well, I wasn't the
star of the show.

15:05.471 --> 15:08.338
Really? 

15:14.747 --> 15:16.714
Who was the star
of the show?

15:18.818 --> 15:21.284
Bob Newhart.

15:21.353 --> 15:24.788
Yeah, that's why they called
it <i> The Bob Newhart Show.</i>

15:24.856 --> 15:25.923
(gasps) 

15:25.992 --> 15:28.259
This is fascinating.

15:30.362 --> 15:35.265
This is just the kind of stuff
I was hoping we'd get into. 

15:35.334 --> 15:37.501
(clears throat) 

15:38.804 --> 15:43.406
Do you mind if I ask you
something else? 

15:43.475 --> 15:45.242
 No, not at all.

15:45.311 --> 15:49.913
I would be honored
if you would become my wife.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.317
(laughing)

15:53.385 --> 15:56.020
(both laughing) 

15:57.123 --> 15:59.523
 You're not serious.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.624
Why?

16:00.693 --> 16:02.359
Well, you know, if
you were serious,

16:02.428 --> 16:05.329
 this would just
 be too bizarre.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.031
Uh... do you like
bizarre?

16:12.571 --> 16:15.272
Well...

16:20.213 --> 16:24.614
Uh, actually
I do, yes.

16:24.683 --> 16:27.151
No, no, but wait.

16:27.219 --> 16:28.685
No, you're getting
ahead of yourself,

16:28.754 --> 16:30.020
far ahead
of yourself.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.656
I-I'm sorry.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.358
It's just that
a long time ago,

16:35.427 --> 16:37.461
I fell in love
with someone

16:37.529 --> 16:41.999
who used to get coffee
for Bob and Jerry,

16:42.067 --> 16:43.834
and now she's here, 

16:43.903 --> 16:45.669
and she's real, 

16:45.738 --> 16:50.640
and she's more beautiful
than I ever thought possible.

16:50.709 --> 16:53.477
 Golly, Jim.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.779
 I know.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.782
Come on.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.216
I mean, look,

16:59.285 --> 17:01.384
if the guy doesn't have 
the talent, 

17:01.453 --> 17:03.254
the least he should do
is hire a manager

17:03.322 --> 17:05.454
to point out
the obvious things. 

17:05.523 --> 17:07.324
Oh, yeah,
like what?

17:07.393 --> 17:08.858
Like dropping
your left.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.260
I don't drop
my left.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.328
(muttering):
I don't know what
you're talk...

17:11.396 --> 17:13.230
Show me your stance.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.232
Come on.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.333
Show me your stance.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.335
(sarcastically):
I'll show you my stance.

17:20.472 --> 17:21.905
All right,
here's my stance.

17:21.973 --> 17:22.906
Okay. 

17:22.974 --> 17:25.075
 Yeah, just like-- yeah.
 Okay.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.385
You know,
you're great.
(laughs)

17:34.453 --> 17:36.854
 You know, with a little bit
more leverage out of this leg,

17:36.922 --> 17:38.155
and if you threw
 it like this...
(screams)

17:38.224 --> 17:40.423
 I hit her, I hit her.

17:40.492 --> 17:41.759
Tommy, I need some ice. 

17:41.827 --> 17:42.993
Vicki, Vicki,
are you all right?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.028
Are you all right,
Vicki?

17:44.096 --> 17:46.430
 Yeah.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.498
 I'm lucky you're a bum.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.241
I'm gonna take a big
chance with you right now.

17:57.309 --> 18:00.577
Bigger than the ones
 you've already taken?

18:00.646 --> 18:03.413
 Oh...

18:04.483 --> 18:06.016
Okay, excuse me, everyone.

18:06.085 --> 18:10.721
 Uh, it is almost 1:00, 
and the <i> shloogel</i> must end.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.022
 ELAINE:
Aw...

18:12.090 --> 18:13.857
Can't we bend tradition a
little and stay a while?

18:13.925 --> 18:16.360
Tradition has nothing
to do with it.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.727
Tommy is kicking us out

18:17.796 --> 18:21.798
and we only have time for
the last ritual of the evening. 

18:21.867 --> 18:22.800
What's that?

18:22.869 --> 18:25.702
Paying the check.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.137
All right, who had the pizza?

18:27.206 --> 18:28.739
Oh, we did. 

18:32.744 --> 18:34.678
Oh, no, no.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.781
All right, come on,
 let's get out of here. 

18:37.850 --> 18:38.982
I'll lead you home.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.317
(chuckles)

18:40.385 --> 18:43.187
Thank you.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.555
 Do you two like
 each other?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.024
Yeah, yeah.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.158
(chuckles)

18:48.227 --> 18:50.761
Yeah, we might
get serious.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.897
 Before you know it,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.833
 she'll be taking me
home to meet the dog.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.035
(laughs)

19:01.407 --> 19:05.609
(indistinct chatter)

19:05.678 --> 19:07.077
 Good night.
Oh, Latka, Simka,
thanks for everything.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.578
Thanks. 
Thank you very much.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.647
Let's go dancing at the Big Sky.

19:10.716 --> 19:11.681
The Big Sky's a dive.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.150
Let's go
to the Parrot Room. 

19:13.219 --> 19:14.151
The Parrot Room?

19:14.219 --> 19:15.352
Yeah.
Are you nuts?

19:15.420 --> 19:16.987
You know, you've got
some mouth on you.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.255
Oh, come on. 

19:18.324 --> 19:20.090
Come here.
 (laughing):
Get your hands off me!

19:20.159 --> 19:22.092
TONY:
You love it, you love it.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.463
Two for two.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.499
Good night, Latka.
 Good night.

19:29.568 --> 19:30.934
Good night, honey, bye. 
 Good night, Elaine.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.101
ARNIE:
Good night. 

19:32.170 --> 19:33.103
(chuckles)

19:33.172 --> 19:34.371
 Good night.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.406
Look, if she says anything
about me tomorrow,

19:36.475 --> 19:39.210
please let me know, 
even if it's negative.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.511
Will you stop it
with that stuff?

19:41.580 --> 19:42.946
 It's not going to be negative. 

19:43.015 --> 19:44.014
Aw...

19:47.119 --> 19:48.151
You know... 

19:48.220 --> 19:49.219
(clears throat) 

19:49.288 --> 19:53.223
...I wrote a lyric
to your theme song. 

19:53.292 --> 19:57.060
 Uh, Jim, could we just, you
know, spend five minutes

19:57.129 --> 19:59.196
without talking about
<i> The Newhart Show?</i>

19:59.265 --> 20:01.332
Good.
Okay.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.499
(indistinct chatter)

20:02.568 --> 20:04.267
Nice to meet you; 
I had a real nice time.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.703
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.839
 Oh, all right, 
 sing it, you big lug.

20:09.908 --> 20:13.643
¶ Here comes Bob and Carol ¶

20:13.712 --> 20:17.247
¶ His wife Emily
really likes him ¶

20:17.316 --> 20:20.150
¶ He has funny people
in his group. ¶ 

20:20.219 --> 20:21.752
Catchy. 
Thanks. 

20:21.821 --> 20:24.220
This was the best night 
I've ever had.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.122
Jim.
Thank you.

20:26.191 --> 20:28.992
 BOTH:
¶ Here comes Bob and Carol ¶

20:29.061 --> 20:32.362
¶ His wife Emily
 really likes him... ¶

20:32.431 --> 20:34.631
They are singing.

20:34.700 --> 20:38.168
Looking good, Latka.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.269
Good night.

20:39.337 --> 20:41.571
LATKA & SIMKA:
 Good night.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.872
Listen, maybe, uh,

20:42.941 --> 20:46.776
maybe you can tell him that 
I'm not really interested.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.745
 Hey, come on,
just let me drive you home.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.613
Oh, no, that's okay,
I'll just get a cab.

20:50.682 --> 20:53.650
I am a cab. 

20:53.719 --> 20:57.154
Well... oh...

21:00.259 --> 21:02.292
Thank you, uh, good night.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.493
Good night, Simka.

21:03.562 --> 21:04.662
Good night.

21:09.902 --> 21:14.037
Oh, boy, you really know
how to throw a <i> shloogel.</i>

21:14.106 --> 21:16.473
I tell you,
that was a real barn burner.

21:16.541 --> 21:20.577
You know, everybody 
fell happily in love.

21:20.646 --> 21:24.147
Everyone turned out 
just splendidly...

21:24.216 --> 21:28.452
except Alex, but I think
he'll recover one day.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.487
What do you think, Simka?

21:30.556 --> 21:34.224
I think we're all going to die. 

21:38.297 --> 21:41.565
I think love is an illusion.

21:44.103 --> 21:50.340
I think we failed with Alex,
 who laughed at our traditions. 

21:52.044 --> 21:56.580
 And he was right because that
 girl will never see him again. 

21:58.684 --> 22:01.585
And so we are
 frauds, my darling.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.088
Oh. 

22:05.157 --> 22:06.756
Too bad.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.495
Damn right, too bad.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.207
Well, good night.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.276
Night.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.145
(sighs) 

22:28.213 --> 22:30.414
Well, ordinarily I'd ask you
 for your phone number, 

22:30.483 --> 22:32.649
but I'd feel kind of silly
asking for that now,

22:32.718 --> 22:35.585
so I'll just... 

22:35.654 --> 22:37.788
 settle 
for the first four digits.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.093
You laughed.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.295
That was funny. 

22:47.599 --> 22:50.734
I'm sorry.

22:50.803 --> 22:54.204
Have you ever been
in a terrible mood all day

22:54.273 --> 22:56.173
and then got a headache 

22:56.242 --> 22:57.741
and cramps, 

22:57.810 --> 23:02.212
and then had some guy start
to fall in love with you?

23:02.280 --> 23:05.182
 Sounds rough.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.385
 5552.

23:08.453 --> 23:10.153
Is that the first four? 

23:10.222 --> 23:13.122
Mm-hmm. 

23:14.393 --> 23:17.527
And the last three are 437.

23:22.767 --> 23:25.202
(chuckles)

23:34.747 --> 23:37.647
(theme song playing)

23:59.771 --> 24:01.038
 WOMAN: 
<i> Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:01.106 --> 24:02.305
(man grumbling) 

24:05.978 --> 24:05.981
(theme song playing)

24:05.982 --> 24:05.985
Oh... Oh, no, no, no.

24:05.986 --> 24:05.989
No, I... No,
I understand.

24:05.990 --> 24:05.993
Yeah. All right, good-bye.

24:05.994 --> 24:05.997
 Banta, Nardo? Reiger, Reiger?

24:05.998 --> 24:06.001
ELAINE: 
What?
ALEX: Hmm?

24:06.002 --> 24:06.005
Come over here. 
Come over here.
