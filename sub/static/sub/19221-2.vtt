WEBVTT

00:01.438 --> 00:02.771
All right. Okay, So I mopped the floor,

00:02.773 --> 00:04.139
refilled the napkin dispenser,

00:04.141 --> 00:05.207
and I wiped down that weird

00:05.209 --> 00:06.709
sculpture thing on the wall back there.

00:06.711 --> 00:08.544
That's a pay phone.

00:08.546 --> 00:10.579
What is wrong with you millennials?

00:10.581 --> 00:11.980
Why does he call us "millennials"

00:11.982 --> 00:14.450
when he's the one who's
a thousand years old?

00:14.452 --> 00:17.419
Yeah. This older generation,
they just don't get us.

00:17.421 --> 00:19.688
Am I right, hashtags?

00:23.426 --> 00:24.660
Sweatpants!

00:24.662 --> 00:26.362
Hey, Franco, here's your notebook.

00:26.364 --> 00:27.596
What took you so long, man?

00:27.598 --> 00:29.498
I was busy doing your
half of the laundry

00:29.500 --> 00:31.567
and washing your half of the dishes.

00:31.569 --> 00:33.168
Oh, well, you see,
now I meant to do that,

00:33.170 --> 00:34.770
but I was just busy paying
your half of the rent.

00:34.772 --> 00:36.271
Hey, brother,

00:36.273 --> 00:37.773
we shouldn't be fighting like this.

00:37.775 --> 00:39.341
That's what the Man wants us to do.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.576
Get out of here, man.

00:40.578 --> 00:42.845
Hey, so, Arthur, I was up all night

00:42.847 --> 00:44.747
thinking of ideas to
boost business, right?

00:44.749 --> 00:46.882
"Boost business"?
Sounds like so much work.

00:46.884 --> 00:47.950
How about

00:47.952 --> 00:49.952
you sell your shop
to me, I tear it down,

00:49.954 --> 00:51.353
and put up a Baby Gap.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.822
But for grown-ups.

00:53.824 --> 00:55.391
Not selling.

00:55.393 --> 00:56.759
- What do you got?
- Okay,

00:56.761 --> 00:59.328
- a donut ATM.
- Oh.

00:59.330 --> 01:00.929
You put in money to get donuts,

01:00.931 --> 01:02.264
or donuts to get money?

01:02.266 --> 01:03.499
Which do you like?

01:03.501 --> 01:04.833
Neither.

01:04.834 --> 01:06.335
Okay, so how about, like,

01:06.337 --> 01:07.770
a cup-shaped donut you
can drink your coffee from?

01:07.772 --> 01:09.772
- It dunks itself.
- No.

01:09.774 --> 01:11.039
How about you not
refraining from declining

01:11.041 --> 01:13.342
- to sell me your shop?
- Yes.

01:13.344 --> 01:15.644
Damn it, you're quick
on that double negative.

01:15.646 --> 01:17.146
All right, so customers
are gonna love this one,

01:17.148 --> 01:18.547
all right. I think you might, too.

01:18.549 --> 01:19.648
Free Wi-Fi.

01:19.650 --> 01:20.549
No!

01:21.377 --> 01:22.735
One of the main reasons I come here

01:22.760 --> 01:24.293
is because there's no
Wi-Fi or phone reception,

01:24.295 --> 01:25.828
so I can focus on my schoolwork.

01:25.830 --> 01:28.330
I have a tendency to be kind
of easily distracted by...

01:28.332 --> 01:31.133
Oh, my God, puppies!

01:31.897 --> 01:32.966
Hey, Tush,

01:32.991 --> 01:33.811
what are you doing?

01:33.836 --> 01:36.059
I started a dog-walking business.

01:36.061 --> 01:38.094
Those rich suckers moving
into the neighborhood

01:38.096 --> 01:39.629
pay ten bucks a head.

01:39.631 --> 01:41.798
I've picked up poop for much less,

01:41.800 --> 01:43.867
oftentimes without a bag.

01:44.802 --> 01:46.102
You can't bring dogs in here.

01:46.104 --> 01:47.304
Fine.

01:47.306 --> 01:49.072
You know what?

01:49.074 --> 01:51.741
Paco's a little overdressed
for this place anyway.

01:51.743 --> 01:52.976
Come on, gang,

01:52.978 --> 01:54.544
we can still make happy hour at Petco.

01:54.546 --> 01:57.180
That place is crawling with bitches.

01:59.984 --> 02:02.352
Okay, so look, I know making
the donuts is your thing,

02:02.354 --> 02:03.887
but I had a few flavor ideas.

02:03.889 --> 02:05.455
Look, kid, I appreciate your enthusiasm,

02:05.457 --> 02:07.557
but before you go changing stuff,

02:07.559 --> 02:08.692
you got to understand the basics.

02:08.693 --> 02:09.995
- Huh?
- Learn from the ground up.

02:10.020 --> 02:10.598
Okay.

02:10.622 --> 02:11.629
- No, I got it.
- Speaking of which,

02:11.654 --> 02:13.221
one of the dogs left
something there on the ground.

02:13.502 --> 02:14.564
Ew.

02:14.566 --> 02:18.201
Oh, wait.

02:18.203 --> 02:20.270
They're little tiny Uggs.

02:20.272 --> 02:22.606
Damn dog's got nicer shoes than me.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.852 --> 02:35.552
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Oh.

02:35.554 --> 02:37.554
Turn off the hippity-hoppity.

02:39.418 --> 02:40.498
Now what the hell are you doing here?

02:40.523 --> 02:42.147
Well, you told me I
had to learn the basics.

02:42.172 --> 02:43.255
So I got here at 4:00 a.m.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.044
so you can teach me how to make a donut.

02:45.068 --> 02:46.367
And look what I made.

02:46.369 --> 02:47.599
It's Doughy!

02:48.972 --> 02:51.439
He's our new mascot.
He can do commercials,

02:51.441 --> 02:53.474
uh, personal appearances,
maybe even a movie.

02:53.476 --> 02:54.742
Oh, look,

02:54.744 --> 02:56.444
he's in Grease.

02:58.748 --> 03:00.982
Why would you... he had a family!

03:02.251 --> 03:04.352
Look, making the best
damn donuts in Chicago

03:04.354 --> 03:06.087
is serious business.

03:06.089 --> 03:07.922
If you really want to learn,
you got to be professional.

03:07.924 --> 03:08.923
Yes, sir.

03:08.925 --> 03:10.425
- I'm ready.
- Now we'll begin

03:10.427 --> 03:11.893
with the classic old-fashioned.

03:11.895 --> 03:13.628
You know, that's the donut
that put this place on the map.

03:13.630 --> 03:14.996
- Word.
- All right.

03:14.998 --> 03:16.064
We'll start with eight cups of flour.

03:16.066 --> 03:16.952
Measuring, I-I can do that.

03:16.977 --> 03:18.176
- Nope.
- Can I hold the bowl?

03:18.201 --> 03:19.135
- Nope.
- Can I ask a question?

03:19.160 --> 03:20.602
- Nope.
- How am I supposed to learn?

03:20.604 --> 03:21.705
That's a question.

03:22.205 --> 03:23.338
All right, look,

03:23.340 --> 03:24.739
I'm gonna teach you the way I was taught

03:24.741 --> 03:26.674
by my donut mentor, Stan Symanski. Huh?

03:26.676 --> 03:28.209
- Okay.
- Today, you watch.

03:28.211 --> 03:30.712
Tomorrow, more watching.
Eventually, you graduate!

03:30.714 --> 03:32.313
To observing.

03:32.315 --> 03:35.516
Come on, dude, I just
want to make a damn donut!

03:35.518 --> 03:36.918
Slow down.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.253
As Symanski said,
"First you make the man,

03:39.255 --> 03:40.648
then you make the donut."

03:42.458 --> 03:43.958
What does that mean?

03:43.960 --> 03:45.360
Beats me.

03:45.362 --> 03:47.895
He was very fond of
the, uh, powdered sugar.

03:48.747 --> 03:49.998
Arthur, so look,

03:50.000 --> 03:51.499
- you know I'm an artist, right?
- Uh.

03:51.501 --> 03:52.867
So don't you want to unlock some of this

03:52.869 --> 03:54.202
- God-given creativity?
- All right, all right,

03:54.204 --> 03:56.337
how about this? Uh, as
soon as I finish this batch,

03:56.339 --> 03:57.872
you can apply the glaze.

03:57.874 --> 03:59.340
- Really? Yes!
- Mm-hmm.

03:59.342 --> 04:00.308
I'm Head Glazer.

04:00.310 --> 04:01.876
Or Executive Glaze Manager.

04:01.878 --> 04:04.412
Or V.P. of Operations, Glaze Division.

04:06.048 --> 04:07.448
- Head Glazer's fine.
- Yeah.

04:10.919 --> 04:12.453
Whoa, Randy.

04:12.455 --> 04:14.188
Rough night, huh?

04:14.190 --> 04:16.017
Yeah, I partied with the Vice Squad.

04:17.128 --> 04:18.860
I need some strong black coffee.

04:18.862 --> 04:20.795
- Got it.
- And then someone to check

04:20.797 --> 04:23.264
if I have an even lower back tattoo.

04:25.835 --> 04:28.403
Hey, James, what are you doing?

04:28.405 --> 04:30.271
I'm watching the new
episode of Doctor Who,

04:30.273 --> 04:32.607
and you can't get a signal in there.

04:32.609 --> 04:34.375
See?

04:34.377 --> 04:37.545
This place is literally
like being in 1966.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.280
Which just happens to be

04:39.282 --> 04:42.050
the year that the good Doctor
has just transported himself to.

04:42.052 --> 04:44.085
He's a time traveler.

04:44.087 --> 04:45.720
Can he transport me to the future

04:45.722 --> 04:47.689
when this conversation's over?

04:49.458 --> 04:50.491
Oh, hey,

04:50.493 --> 04:51.426
what can I get you?

04:51.428 --> 04:52.660
Uh, what do you recommend?

04:52.662 --> 04:53.594
Well, I would suggest

04:53.596 --> 04:55.196
a few rubber bands in your beard,

04:55.198 --> 04:57.665
but I see you got that covered.

04:57.667 --> 05:00.301
How about one of my classic
old-fashioned glazed, huh?

05:00.303 --> 05:02.170
Sure, yeah, I'll, uh, take a dozen.

05:02.172 --> 05:04.038
All right, coming right up. Franco!

05:04.040 --> 05:05.973
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:05.975 --> 05:07.275
What's with the orange ones?

05:07.277 --> 05:08.576
Oh, well, I hope you don't mind,

05:08.578 --> 05:09.744
but I got all inspired,

05:09.746 --> 05:11.679
so I put a few drops of
Sriracha in the glaze.

05:11.681 --> 05:13.514
Sriracha? What... What the hell is that?

05:13.516 --> 05:15.396
It's hot sauce made from chili peppers.

05:15.506 --> 05:17.151
Uh, can I try one of those?

05:17.153 --> 05:18.219
Yeah.

05:18.221 --> 05:19.987
Go for it, white Lenny Kravitz.

05:22.324 --> 05:23.524
What the hell's going on?

05:23.526 --> 05:24.992
I was just starting to
teach you the basics.

05:24.994 --> 05:25.993
I mean, you're not ready to start

05:25.995 --> 05:27.161
messing with the recipe now.

05:27.163 --> 05:28.296
Well, you don't get to be Head Glazer

05:28.298 --> 05:30.198
- by playing it safe.
- Now look,

05:30.200 --> 05:31.299
I'm not paying you
to reinvent the donut.

05:31.301 --> 05:32.633
Now I got to throw those away,

05:32.635 --> 05:33.634
because nobody's gonna want 'em.

05:33.636 --> 05:35.136
Yeah, I'll take a dozen.

05:35.138 --> 05:36.604
Seriously?

05:36.606 --> 05:38.039
Yeah, these things are amazing.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.041
Oh, see, thank you, Rubber Band Man.

05:40.043 --> 05:41.743
Good job. All right, cool, dude!

05:46.349 --> 05:48.082
Doctor Who!

05:48.084 --> 05:49.283
I have Wi-Fi!

05:49.285 --> 05:51.935
Really? Where's it coming from?

05:51.960 --> 05:54.789
Uh, looks like Fawz's
dry cleaners next door.

05:54.791 --> 05:56.190
And there's no password.

05:56.192 --> 05:59.360
Well, I have gotten a
lot of work done today.

05:59.362 --> 06:02.029
Time to unwind with a little Wurdle.

06:02.031 --> 06:05.127
Then head home, take
a bath, and go for it.

06:07.369 --> 06:08.402
No, it's...

06:08.404 --> 06:10.004
it's an online word game.

06:10.006 --> 06:13.541
I used to play a lot. Had
to quit when I got R.F.S...

06:13.543 --> 06:15.676
Restless Finger Syndrome.

06:15.678 --> 06:17.879
I did a walkathon for that.

06:17.881 --> 06:20.548
Thank you... from all of us.

06:21.583 --> 06:24.552
Here you go. Thank you, Jack Sparrow.

06:26.288 --> 06:28.322
See? Somebody just bought my donuts.

06:28.324 --> 06:29.423
All right. Let me try one.

06:29.425 --> 06:30.735
Go ahead.

06:32.628 --> 06:34.295
- Mmm.
- Yeah?

06:34.297 --> 06:36.864
- Ooh.
- Huh?

06:38.803 --> 06:40.968
All right, you're not a fan.

06:40.970 --> 06:42.804
Look, I've been in the donut
game long enough to know

06:42.806 --> 06:44.372
what's not gonna catch on.

06:44.374 --> 06:46.012
Okay, but that dude loved it.

06:46.037 --> 06:47.285
Oh, I wouldn't go by him.

06:47.418 --> 06:50.045
He just put on a top hat,
rode off on a wooden bicycle

06:50.070 --> 06:51.342
with a lizard on his shoulder.

06:52.482 --> 06:54.015
It's a fluke, kid.

06:54.017 --> 06:56.317
Don't go patting yourself on the back.

06:59.888 --> 07:02.557
Hey, Arthur, my hands are
full of these fluke donuts.

07:02.559 --> 07:05.046
Would-Would you mind
patting me on the back?

07:06.288 --> 07:08.830
How about I put my foot up your ass?

07:08.832 --> 07:10.398
What was that? "Good work, Franco"?

07:10.400 --> 07:11.399
Thank you.

07:11.401 --> 07:13.340
A dozen Srirachos, please.

07:13.369 --> 07:15.247
Oh, I'm sorry, but I
only have five left.

07:15.272 --> 07:16.465
Oh, good news!

07:16.490 --> 07:18.254
We got plenty of my
old-fashioned glazed. There.

07:18.279 --> 07:20.341
Yeah. You know, that's the donut

07:20.343 --> 07:21.909
that put this place on the map.

07:21.911 --> 07:23.978
No, I want the ones I saw on Instagram.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.246
The Sriracha ones.

07:25.248 --> 07:26.647
If you're making more, I can wait.

07:26.649 --> 07:29.250
I'll just finish my adult coloring book.

07:30.195 --> 07:31.118
I'll get right on it, okay?

07:31.120 --> 07:33.988
Yeah, sure, of course
they like Srirachos, huh?

07:33.990 --> 07:35.256
They're hipsters.

07:35.258 --> 07:37.191
Thank God I still got my regulars.

07:37.193 --> 07:39.493
Did Franco say he's
bringing out more Srirachos?

07:39.495 --> 07:41.229
Et tu, Tush?

07:41.231 --> 07:43.397
Oh, I et way more than two.

07:47.052 --> 07:50.862
Ladies and gentlemen. Bringing
the heat from the streets,

07:50.887 --> 07:52.524
the guru of the glaze,

07:53.036 --> 07:55.236
the professor of the pastry,

07:55.238 --> 07:57.605
the Bro of the Diz-ough...

07:58.974 --> 08:01.542
Franco Wicks.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.879
Hey, wait a minute What... what-what...

08:05.324 --> 08:06.369
Franco, what is that?

08:06.394 --> 08:07.982
Oh, just my latest creation.

08:07.984 --> 08:10.057
I just took my trademark
Sriracha donut...

08:10.081 --> 08:10.963
All right, all right.

08:10.987 --> 08:13.187
- dusted it with habanero sprinkles.
- Don't hurt 'em now.

08:13.189 --> 08:15.923
And I dipped it in ghost pepper glaze.

08:15.925 --> 08:17.124
And I finished it off with...

08:17.126 --> 08:18.392
Oh, no you didn't.

08:18.394 --> 08:20.428
A jalapeño in the middle!

08:20.430 --> 08:22.296
I present to y'all...

08:22.298 --> 08:23.645
El Diablo.

08:24.747 --> 08:26.864
Somebody call the fire
department up in here.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.403
Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, wee-ooh, wee-ooh.

08:29.405 --> 08:31.005
But I got a challenge.

08:31.007 --> 08:33.340
Anyone that can finish one
of these in under a minute,

08:33.342 --> 08:35.241
gets their picture on
the "Wall of Flame."

08:35.244 --> 08:37.044
Hey, hey, hey.

08:37.046 --> 08:39.145
Wait a minute. My picture
used to be up there.

08:39.148 --> 08:40.548
Oh, I-I'll put it back up.

08:40.549 --> 08:41.943
If you can finish one of
these in under a minute.

08:41.969 --> 08:44.518
No. No, thanks. What kind of an idiot

08:44.520 --> 08:46.921
would like to burn his tongue
off for a stupid picture?

08:46.923 --> 08:48.831
Ah, this kind.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.267
Hot.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.777
It feels like I'm eating the sun.

09:00.035 --> 09:02.103
Randy, you sure you don't
want to watch Doctor Who?

09:02.105 --> 09:03.804
The 24th season is the best.

09:03.806 --> 09:06.574
No. You can tell me what happens.

09:06.576 --> 09:08.988
Then I can tell you
what a vagina looks like.

09:10.545 --> 09:12.580
Oh James, it's awful.

09:12.582 --> 09:15.249
The Wi-Fi is out.

09:15.251 --> 09:17.485
How unfortunate.

09:17.487 --> 09:18.819
I was next door

09:18.821 --> 09:21.021
watching a YouTube video
of a sneezing panda,

09:21.023 --> 09:22.456
until it froze.

09:22.458 --> 09:23.757
Mid-sneeze.

09:23.759 --> 09:25.570
I got the "ah", but no "choo."

09:27.462 --> 09:28.829
And that's when I realized,

09:28.831 --> 09:30.664
someone is stealing my Wi-Fi.

09:30.666 --> 09:33.968
- Maya, you should be ashamed of yourself.
- James, how could you?

09:33.970 --> 09:36.731
Who knew Chicago Police were so corrupt?

09:37.840 --> 09:39.640
I mean, sure, everybody knew, but...

09:40.528 --> 09:41.742
You know what I mean.

09:41.744 --> 09:44.044
Well, I've taken care of the problem.

09:44.046 --> 09:46.914
My Wi-Fi is now protected with
a password you will never guess.

09:46.916 --> 09:48.415
Never.

09:48.417 --> 09:50.484
Is it "sneezingpanda"?

09:50.486 --> 09:52.686
I'll be right back.

09:54.923 --> 09:57.858
Wow, people are really
loving Franco's new donut.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.660
Yeah, I don't get it, you know?

09:59.662 --> 10:00.928
Wait, uh, uh, look at him.

10:00.930 --> 10:02.883
Am I still chewing?

10:04.534 --> 10:05.774
I can't tell.

10:08.203 --> 10:09.670
You see what I mean?

10:09.672 --> 10:11.005
Donuts are not supposed to hurt.

10:11.007 --> 10:12.406
They're supposed to be sweet.

10:12.408 --> 10:13.974
Yeah. I know. It's weird,

10:13.976 --> 10:16.777
but people like all these
crazy flavors these days.

10:16.779 --> 10:20.658
Like salty chocolate and
bone marrow ice cream.

10:22.220 --> 10:25.352
You know, if they had a whiskey
burrito, I could save a step.

10:26.950 --> 10:28.722
Hey! It's done!

10:28.724 --> 10:31.125
Whew! Was that under a minute?!

10:31.127 --> 10:33.093
Huh?

10:35.096 --> 10:36.864
Oh, snap. I forgot to
start the stopwatch.

10:36.866 --> 10:38.098
All right, hold on.

10:39.467 --> 10:42.931
I hope my colon has
its affairs in order.

10:47.416 --> 10:49.743
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!

10:49.745 --> 10:51.812
Welcome to the Wall of Flame.

10:53.749 --> 10:56.083
How do you do that, Fawz?

10:56.085 --> 10:58.819
Mm. When I was eight,

10:58.821 --> 11:00.821
my village was attacked
with mustard gas,

11:00.823 --> 11:03.104
so I have no feeling in my esophagus.

11:04.049 --> 11:06.213
Also, if I lick a battery, I die.

11:08.564 --> 11:10.264
We have got to get Fawz's password.

11:10.266 --> 11:12.800
It's always personal information.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.401
Come on, you're a cop.

11:14.403 --> 11:16.637
Just go get the password. But be subtle.

11:16.639 --> 11:17.664
Subtle.

11:22.078 --> 11:24.044
Boy, you sure do like donuts!
Did your mom make 'em for you?

11:24.046 --> 11:26.981
And if so, what was her maiden name?

11:26.983 --> 11:29.984
Hussein. No relation.

11:29.986 --> 11:32.386
Fine. Distant cousin.

11:34.356 --> 11:37.691
Interesting. Um, did you
have any childhood pets?

11:37.693 --> 11:39.727
Oh, yes. Jabir.

11:39.729 --> 11:43.084
He wasn't so much a pet as
a partially brain-dead uncle.

11:43.866 --> 11:47.101
But he brought that
Frisbee back every time.

11:48.788 --> 11:50.037
And how do you spell that?

11:50.039 --> 11:54.475
Yes, it's, uh, J-A-B...

11:54.477 --> 11:56.277
Wait, are you trying

11:56.279 --> 11:59.113
to guess my password?! Shame!

11:59.115 --> 12:01.081
And here I thought you were
trying to get to know the real

12:01.083 --> 12:03.150
Fawz Hamadani Farooq Al-Shahrani!

12:05.287 --> 12:07.021
All right. Who'd like to try

12:07.023 --> 12:08.922
a new and exciting donut flavor?

12:08.924 --> 12:11.058
If they like Srirachos,
they're gonna love this.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.427
It tastes like pickles. I call it...

12:13.429 --> 12:15.129
the Dill-Donut.

12:18.291 --> 12:21.001
Uh, Arthur, y-you can't call it that.

12:21.003 --> 12:22.069
Why not?

12:22.071 --> 12:23.237
Say it again.

12:23.239 --> 12:24.538
Dill-Donut.

12:28.028 --> 12:29.035
Slower.

12:29.068 --> 12:30.902
Okay. Dill-Do... Oh.

12:32.971 --> 12:33.978
I'll work on the name.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.183
Hey, why won't you try one?
I... They're totally unique.

12:36.185 --> 12:38.519
- Try it.
- Oh, yeah. All right.

12:38.521 --> 12:39.687
Huh...

12:39.689 --> 12:41.255
Oh, yeah. Oh.

12:42.171 --> 12:43.945
- That's... That's unique.
- Yeh

12:45.546 --> 12:48.376
That dill flavor's coming through hard.

12:50.032 --> 12:52.232
It's like one bite's
all you'll ever need.

12:52.234 --> 12:54.168
All you will ever need.

12:54.170 --> 12:55.302
All right, all right, fine.

12:55.304 --> 12:56.470
Back by popular demand,

12:56.472 --> 12:57.638
Los Diablos.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.906
Call an exorcist.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.008
The devil's in the house!

13:01.010 --> 13:02.898
All right, man. I have
this whole new promotion

13:02.929 --> 13:04.639
planned for later. Big fiesta theme.

13:04.714 --> 13:05.779
Hey, whoa, whoa!

13:05.781 --> 13:06.980
Those are my glazed.

13:06.982 --> 13:08.949
Oh, I'm just making
room for Los Diablos.

13:08.951 --> 13:10.084
No. No, you're not.

13:10.086 --> 13:11.372
What? Arthur, I'm just giving the people

13:11.397 --> 13:12.930
what they want. You know what they want?

13:12.955 --> 13:14.288
You've been working here one month.

13:14.735 --> 13:15.823
What you mad for? You hired me

13:15.825 --> 13:17.257
to bring in new customers, right?

13:17.259 --> 13:19.059
Yeah! Yeah, but not
to change everything.

13:19.061 --> 13:20.728
I think you mean "making things better."

13:20.730 --> 13:23.163
Oh, please. With the
contest and the photos, huh?

13:23.165 --> 13:24.932
Just a bunch of stupid gimmicks.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.801
Gimmicks? I'm an artist.
I-I don't do gimmicks.

13:33.675 --> 13:36.110
♪ El Diablo ♪

13:36.112 --> 13:39.513
♪ El Diablo, El Diablo ♪

13:39.515 --> 13:40.981
-♪ El Diablo ♪
- Stop.

13:40.983 --> 13:42.216
- ♪ El Diablo. ♪
- Stop!

13:44.246 --> 13:46.058
Do you guys know any Steely Dan?

13:48.035 --> 13:51.125
♪ I've seen your picture ♪

13:51.127 --> 13:54.161
♪ Your name in lights above it... ♪

13:57.368 --> 13:58.734
That's the last of the Srirachos.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.309
And I can't make anymore.

14:00.387 --> 14:02.454
Arthur's gone, so I'm
stuck working the counter.

14:02.456 --> 14:04.489
How am I gonna tell people
all the Srirachos are gone?

14:04.491 --> 14:07.492
No mo' Sriracho!

14:09.028 --> 14:11.062
You act like this job is hard.

14:13.966 --> 14:15.400
Tush, what are you doing?

14:15.402 --> 14:18.103
Taking Pudgy for a walk.

14:18.105 --> 14:19.904
Poor thing's got anxiety,

14:19.906 --> 14:21.740
thought I'd give him a little extra TLC.

14:25.211 --> 14:27.212
I just tried Arthur again.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.047
Went straight to voice mail.

14:29.049 --> 14:30.315
I don't know why he's so mad.

14:30.317 --> 14:31.883
My donuts have been our best sellers.

14:31.885 --> 14:33.151
You got a gift, kid.

14:33.153 --> 14:34.918
I can still taste that Diablo.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.655
See? Thanks, Tush.

14:37.657 --> 14:39.030
No, I mean, that's all I can taste.

14:40.993 --> 14:42.227
But on the bright side,

14:42.229 --> 14:43.780
it brought my dead tooth back to life.

14:45.655 --> 14:46.610
Come on, Pudgy.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.508
Let me show you what
it's like to pee indoors.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.849
Randy, I've been working my
ass off since I started here.

14:53.943 --> 14:55.994
All right? I show up
early, I even stay up late

14:56.019 --> 14:57.410
thinking of ideas for this damn place,

14:57.435 --> 14:58.871
and he always shuts them down.

14:59.254 --> 15:02.269
Sounds like Arthur's not
the only one who's mad.

15:02.294 --> 15:03.727
All right, yeah.

15:03.729 --> 15:05.261
I thought I found the job

15:05.263 --> 15:06.503
where I'm not just doing
grunt work, you know?

15:06.581 --> 15:09.165
Where I can be creative,
where I contribute, maybe,

15:09.167 --> 15:10.343
maybe even make a
difference in the community.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.382
Putting icing on a donut?

15:13.805 --> 15:16.147
All right, when you put it
like that, I sound like a loser.

15:16.460 --> 15:20.092
You're not a loser.
You're just an idiot.

15:22.666 --> 15:24.283
Look at it from Arthur's point of view.

15:24.831 --> 15:27.065
He's been making donuts his whole life.

15:27.067 --> 15:29.667
And you come in here and outshine him.

15:29.669 --> 15:33.271
Now he feels old and obsolete.

15:33.273 --> 15:37.092
Like a record player in a CD world.

15:38.211 --> 15:40.467
Randy, nobody buys CDs anymore.

15:41.348 --> 15:43.232
Don't make me plant drugs on you.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.584
Whoa! Okay.

15:46.586 --> 15:47.520
What kind of drugs?

15:51.257 --> 15:53.691
All I'm saying is slow your roll.

15:53.693 --> 15:56.361
- Okay.
- Arthur doesn't like to be rushed.

15:56.363 --> 15:59.128
He didn't even put that pay
phone in until last summer.

16:01.567 --> 16:03.802
Well, that was awkward.

16:03.804 --> 16:06.438
As it turns out, Pudgy is a girl.

16:14.768 --> 16:15.690
Poor Arthur.

16:15.715 --> 16:17.749
He forgot where he works.

16:17.751 --> 16:18.917
It's right in there.

16:18.919 --> 16:20.328
No, no. I know that.

16:21.195 --> 16:22.867
It's just that I feel...

16:23.223 --> 16:25.290
I just don't belong in there anymore.

16:25.292 --> 16:28.093
Well, maybe it's time
for you to sell to me.

16:28.095 --> 16:30.995
Yeah, you know what? Maybe it is.

16:30.997 --> 16:32.960
Well, you can't blame
me for try... Wait, what?

16:34.429 --> 16:37.068
I mean, everything is
changing. You know? I...

16:37.070 --> 16:40.205
I feel like a relic from another time.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.739
Well, lucky for you,

16:41.741 --> 16:44.275
I have got the contract right here.

16:44.277 --> 16:47.011
I've been carrying
this around since 2012.

16:47.013 --> 16:50.915
All I have to do is change the date,

16:50.917 --> 16:53.051
cross out your late wife's name...

16:53.053 --> 16:54.120
My condolences, by the way.

16:55.322 --> 16:57.555
Can you believe I've owned
this place for 47 years?

16:57.557 --> 16:59.124
Yes, very long time.

16:59.126 --> 17:01.326
You're getting tired,
you're slowing down.

17:01.328 --> 17:02.360
Now you have the black guy.

17:02.362 --> 17:03.561
His name is Franco.

17:03.563 --> 17:04.929
Yes, I know. Ha, ha.

17:04.931 --> 17:07.104
I was just making sure you
knew who I was talking about.

17:08.001 --> 17:09.834
Anyway, he seems like
he knows what he's doing.

17:09.836 --> 17:10.901
Yeah, I know.

17:10.925 --> 17:12.368
He's talented, he's ambitious.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.470
But there's a lot he doesn't know yet.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.321
Yeah? What's to know? It's just donuts.

17:16.347 --> 17:18.290
No, I wouldn't say that.

17:18.377 --> 17:20.712
People think that donuts
are just something you eat,

17:20.714 --> 17:22.614
Well, not to me it isn't. No, no way,

17:22.616 --> 17:24.214
they mean a hell of a lot more to me.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.292
Yes, of course.

17:25.318 --> 17:26.644
Uh, I'm gonna need your thumbprint.

17:28.421 --> 17:30.722
You know, Fawz, in this
crazy and uncertain world,

17:30.724 --> 17:33.627
what could be more comforting
than a... than a donut?

17:33.682 --> 17:35.460
And a cup of coffee, huh?

17:35.462 --> 17:37.395
To be the one to bring that to people,

17:37.397 --> 17:40.238
I mean, there could be no
higher calling than that.

17:40.263 --> 17:43.769
You know something, if
happiness was a food,

17:43.794 --> 17:45.436
this is where you'd find it.

17:45.438 --> 17:46.592
Very moving.

17:46.617 --> 17:48.209
Do you happen to have two forms of ID?

17:49.045 --> 17:50.942
See, that's what that
kid doesn't understand.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.577
No, he's got big ideas.

17:52.579 --> 17:54.909
He just doesn't see the big picture.

17:55.003 --> 17:56.800
Okay. Well, you know.
Here, just... Here you go.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.175
Thank you, Fawz. Thank you very much.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.854
Oh, there you go.

18:02.856 --> 18:04.989
- I was starting to get worried.
- Why?

18:04.991 --> 18:06.157
'Cause it's cold out
and you're old as hell.

18:06.182 --> 18:08.108
Yeah. Well, I'm fine.

18:08.133 --> 18:09.618
Just follow me.

18:11.055 --> 18:12.430
Put on an apron.

18:12.432 --> 18:14.332
For what?

18:14.334 --> 18:16.768
'Cause I'm gonna teach you
how to make a jelly donut.

18:16.770 --> 18:18.870
- Right now?
- Yeah.

18:18.872 --> 18:21.072
You started with the old
fashioned. Now it's jelly.

18:21.074 --> 18:23.469
And then we'll... we'll move on, huh?

18:23.494 --> 18:26.948
To, uh, fritters,
long johns, bear claws.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.646
- And what brought this on?
- Well, I was thinking.

18:28.725 --> 18:30.559
You know, you got potential,
but there's a hell of a lot

18:30.584 --> 18:31.816
you don't know yet.

18:31.818 --> 18:34.319
Understood. And thank you.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.853
So why don't you get
me that raspberry jelly?

18:35.855 --> 18:37.455
Okay. All right.

18:39.325 --> 18:40.691
You know what'd be dope?

18:40.716 --> 18:42.193
Like, instead of a jelly donut,

18:42.195 --> 18:44.362
we did a peanut butter and jelly donut.

18:44.364 --> 18:46.364
- Peanut butter?
- Sorry. You're right.

18:46.366 --> 18:47.265
I'm overstepping.

18:47.267 --> 18:48.266
No, I like it.

18:48.268 --> 18:49.601
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:49.603 --> 18:51.836
All those hipsters, huh?

18:51.838 --> 18:54.038
With their bikes and
their coloring books.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.802
Oh, they j...

18:55.827 --> 18:58.763
they just love reliving
their childhoods, don't they?

18:58.788 --> 19:02.180
And they love paying eight
dollars for almond milk.

19:03.483 --> 19:05.580
You can't get no milk from almonds.

19:07.143 --> 19:09.220
Okay. Let's see if we can make

19:09.222 --> 19:11.856
a peanut butter and jelly donut, huh?

19:11.858 --> 19:12.924
Now, pass me that yeast.

19:12.926 --> 19:13.958
Oh, can I measure it?

19:13.960 --> 19:15.059
- Nope.
- Can I pour the flour?

19:15.061 --> 19:16.143
- Nope.
- This is gonna be fun.

19:23.092 --> 19:25.873
Here it is, our new flavor. PB&J.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.381
I'll go.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.622
I can't feel my face.

19:35.489 --> 19:36.692
Are there peanuts in these?

19:36.717 --> 19:39.374
Yeah. What'd you think
the "PB" stood for?

19:39.376 --> 19:41.776
- "Probably bacon"?
- Oh, no.

19:41.778 --> 19:42.944
I'm allergic to peanuts.

19:42.969 --> 19:44.594
Oh, my God. What can we do for you?

19:44.619 --> 19:47.680
Luckily, Pudgy is allergic to bees.

19:47.727 --> 19:49.952
Let's hope dog EpiPens work on humans.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.874
Stay with us, Tush.

19:55.828 --> 19:56.913
See?

19:56.938 --> 20:00.695
What fun. This is what you
missed when we had Wi-Fi.

20:02.065 --> 20:04.309
It's true. Now we can
talk to each other,

20:04.334 --> 20:06.270
forge real human connections.

20:06.295 --> 20:10.065
Hey, Franco talked me
into getting Wi-Fi. Huh?

20:10.106 --> 20:11.620
So it's there if you want it.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.698
- Yeah, nice knowing you.
- Thank God.

20:15.873 --> 20:18.281
Oh, come on. You
guessed my new password?

20:18.306 --> 20:20.789
Is "iraqilovejockey" that obvious?
