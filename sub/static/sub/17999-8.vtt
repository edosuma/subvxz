00:03.061 --> 00:04.011
Hey, did your parents let you

00:04.046 --> 00:05.696
Watch horror movies
at a young age?

00:05.731 --> 00:07.865
I remember when I went
to see <i>Jaws</i> for the first time.

00:07.899 --> 00:08.966
- How old were you?
- Eight.

00:09.001 --> 00:10.701
I had to be removed
from the theater.

00:10.736 --> 00:12.536
- [laughs]
- It was that traumatic?

00:12.570 --> 00:14.238
I remember it
was too intense for me,

00:14.272 --> 00:15.806
And my mom leaned over,
and was like, "are you okay?

00:15.840 --> 00:16.807
Do you want to stay
and watch it?"

00:16.841 --> 00:17.858
And I was like, "no."

00:17.893 --> 00:19.510
"Do you want
to go dress shopping?"

00:19.528 --> 00:21.678
[laughter]

00:21.697 --> 00:23.114
It's just weird,
like, nowadays,

00:23.148 --> 00:24.865
Like, you probably wouldn't even
think to take, you know,

00:24.916 --> 00:26.484
An eight- or nine-year-old
to a horror movie.

00:26.518 --> 00:27.818
When <i>Grizzly</i> came out,
I told my mom,

00:27.852 --> 00:28.819
"I want to see that,"
and she was like,

00:28.853 --> 00:29.904
"Are you sure?

00:29.955 --> 00:31.455
You remember what happened
in <i>Jaws?"</i>

00:31.490 --> 00:33.824
I was like, "No, I'm older now.
I can see <i>Grizzly."</i>

00:33.859 --> 00:36.360
There was a moment, the first
time the bear attacked somebody,

00:36.378 --> 00:40.081
And, like, off-camera,
you just see an arm fly by--

00:40.132 --> 00:41.549
A bloody arm fly by--

00:41.583 --> 00:43.367
And my mom looked at me,
and I was like, "Let's go."

00:43.402 --> 00:44.668
Then he got his period.

00:44.703 --> 00:47.204

Hello, and welcome to another
episode of <i>Comic Book Men,</i>

01:26.044 --> 01:29.180
The only show with a hairier
member than a wookie, man.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.581
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:30.615 --> 01:32.583
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:32.617 --> 01:34.151
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:34.185 --> 01:35.703
Okay, what come
through da doors this week?

01:35.754 --> 01:36.987
Enlighten us.

01:37.022 --> 01:39.957
I had a really cool item
come in the other day.

01:44.496 --> 01:45.696
- How's it goin', fellas?
- How you doin'?

01:45.730 --> 01:47.047
Got something here
I thought you guys

01:47.099 --> 01:48.065
Might be interested in.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.517
All right, what do ya got?

01:49.568 --> 01:52.403
Right here,
I got the first issue of

01:52.437 --> 01:53.804
<i>The Walking Dead.</i>

01:53.822 --> 01:55.489
Whoa.

01:55.524 --> 01:59.310
The creme de la creme
of the comics world right now.

02:06.818 --> 02:07.868
That's a first printing?

02:07.903 --> 02:08.985
That is a first printing.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.287
I bought it directly
off the shelf...

02:10.321 --> 02:12.389
- Oh, yeah?
- In October of 2003.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.924
I believe it was $3.99.

02:13.942 --> 02:15.159
Why are you selling it, man?

02:15.177 --> 02:18.328
This is like--
right now, I mean, it's just...

02:18.346 --> 02:19.329
That's like a lottery ticket
right there.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.631
It's better than gold.

02:20.665 --> 02:22.716
Well,
I'm an amateur photographer,

02:22.767 --> 02:24.185
And I'm looking
to start my own business,

02:24.219 --> 02:26.336
Make it a little larger,
buy some equipment,

02:26.354 --> 02:28.739
Studio equipment, lenses,
all that fun stuff.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.442
What are you looking for
for this?

02:31.476 --> 02:33.494
Well, I wanted $2,000.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.645
[laughter]

02:34.679 --> 02:36.413
Where did you
get that number from?

02:36.447 --> 02:39.583
The 9.8 had sold
on the internet for $7,000,

02:39.618 --> 02:43.704
And I know a shop in my area
just sold one for $800.

02:43.738 --> 02:44.872
Wait a second.

02:44.923 --> 02:47.241
You said you wanted
to sell it for $2,000,

02:47.292 --> 02:48.375
But the shop in your area
sold it for $800.

02:48.426 --> 02:49.493
Yes.

02:49.511 --> 02:50.661
So do you think he needs

02:50.695 --> 02:52.112
To take a loss on his taxes,
or something?

02:52.164 --> 02:54.198
[laughter]

02:54.232 --> 02:55.566
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

02:55.600 --> 02:58.569
And say, in the last 20 years,
I don't think a book

02:58.603 --> 03:01.405
Has risen in price--not even
published by the big two,

03:01.439 --> 03:03.507
Marvel or DC--
than <i>Walking Dead</i> #1.

03:03.542 --> 03:04.975
That's a pricy book?
Why?

03:05.010 --> 03:07.912
It's a pricy book because
the print run was so small.

03:07.946 --> 03:08.946
How small was it?

03:08.980 --> 03:10.781
Less than 8,000 copies
were printed,

03:10.815 --> 03:13.601
And I think that as long
as that tv show

03:13.635 --> 03:15.135
Is where it's at right now,

03:15.187 --> 03:16.987
I mean, people are gonna
be coming in for that book,

03:17.021 --> 03:18.489
And I wouldn't be surprised
to see that book

03:18.523 --> 03:20.023
Crack four figures.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.726
Really?

03:22.761 --> 03:25.196
It's got some speckling
on it right here.

03:25.230 --> 03:27.448
Can you see it,
on rick's leg right there?

03:27.482 --> 03:30.067
There's some white speckling.
Oh, yeah.

03:30.101 --> 03:31.535
- Smegma.
- Oh, yeah.

03:31.553 --> 03:33.804
Yeah, and there's a bit
of smegma on there.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.056
In this condition,
it's probably gonna go

03:36.107 --> 03:38.242
Probably $700, or less,

03:38.276 --> 03:41.028
So knowing that,
I fail to see how you think

03:41.079 --> 03:44.331
I can pay any more than...

03:44.366 --> 03:45.866
$350 for it.

03:45.917 --> 03:47.451
So $350 your offer?

03:47.469 --> 03:49.687
$350 cash for a book
in this condition,

03:49.721 --> 03:52.072
Ungraded, with the smegma.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.073
[laughter]

03:53.108 --> 03:54.225
You know what I'm saying?

03:54.259 --> 03:56.193
'cause I gotta make a profit
on it.

03:56.228 --> 03:58.229
Yeah, um--

03:58.263 --> 04:00.431
All right, how about $700?

04:02.784 --> 04:03.867
How about $450?

04:03.902 --> 04:05.452
That's really--

04:05.487 --> 04:07.621
And that's more than
I even wanted to pay for it.

04:07.656 --> 04:10.774
It'sobviously,
you want it, so $500.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.210
$450. Obviously,
you're reading me wrong.

04:13.245 --> 04:16.079
$450 is definitely as high
as I can go.

04:16.113 --> 04:18.132
Okay. Well, I thank you
for your time.

04:18.183 --> 04:20.416
I appreciate it very much.
$460.

04:20.452 --> 04:21.918
$500.

04:21.952 --> 04:23.837
No.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.756
Nope.

04:25.790 --> 04:26.757
Nope.

04:26.791 --> 04:27.825
Can't do it.
- All right.

04:27.859 --> 04:29.476
You guys have a good one.
Thank you.

04:29.511 --> 04:30.828
Have a good one.

04:30.862 --> 04:32.279
I'm bummed, man.
I wanted it.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.280
Yeah?

04:33.315 --> 04:35.149
Yeah, that's the jewel

04:35.200 --> 04:38.068
Of the current comic book crown
right there.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.042
We're all set.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.143
Separate bags, gang?

04:46.177 --> 04:47.678
- Yeah!
- All right!

04:47.712 --> 04:49.546
You guys enjoy those.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.116
Thanks.

04:52.150 --> 04:53.183
Holy crap.

04:53.218 --> 04:54.418
You guys
are never gonna believe

04:54.436 --> 04:56.086
Who's gonna be coming
into the store tomorrow.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.354
It's unbelievable.

04:57.389 --> 04:59.123
I mean, it's insane. - Come on!

04:59.157 --> 05:00.341
- Tomorrow...
- Okay.

05:00.392 --> 05:02.009
Stan Lee
is coming to the Stash.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.362
- Stan Lee?
- Stanley who?

05:05.397 --> 05:06.530
I remember getting the call.

05:06.548 --> 05:09.300
Um, some photographer studio

05:09.334 --> 05:12.169
Wanted to do some sort
of charity photograph session

05:12.203 --> 05:16.307
With Stan, and they chose
the Stash as the backdrop.

05:16.341 --> 05:17.858
I thought I was being,
you know--a trick.

05:17.892 --> 05:19.176
I thought he was--

05:19.194 --> 05:20.844
- That you were being punked,
or something like that?

05:20.879 --> 05:22.446
[laughter]

05:22.480 --> 05:24.248
Of all the stores in america
they could have chose,

05:24.282 --> 05:25.249
They chose the Stash.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.867
- No way.
- Wow.

05:26.901 --> 05:29.053
This is gonna
be unbelievable, man.

05:30.588 --> 05:32.473
Hey, he's here! He's here!

05:32.524 --> 05:34.508
Guys, mr. Stan Lee.

05:38.802 --> 05:40.119
- Ready?
- Ready.

05:40.154 --> 05:42.121
And go!

05:42.172 --> 05:43.456
Nice. Both: Oh!

05:43.507 --> 05:44.924
[laughter]

05:44.975 --> 05:47.210
- How much time is left?
- Five seconds!

05:47.244 --> 05:50.446
Both: Oh! - Three seconds!

05:50.481 --> 05:51.431
One second! [mimics buzzer]

05:51.482 --> 05:54.250
[cheers and laughs]

05:54.284 --> 05:57.186
Oh!

05:57.221 --> 05:59.255
[mimics crowd cheering]

05:59.273 --> 06:03.242
[laughter]

06:03.293 --> 06:04.711
- Hey
- How are you?

06:04.762 --> 06:06.879
I'm the good things
that come in a small package.

06:06.930 --> 06:09.365
- All--all right.
- My name's Jeff

06:09.400 --> 06:10.466
How you doin', Jeff?
Walt.

06:10.501 --> 06:11.500
What do you got?

06:11.518 --> 06:12.802
Brought something
that you might

06:12.836 --> 06:16.105
Be interested in today.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.057
Ooh. Is that #6?

06:18.108 --> 06:20.109
- That is <i>Hulk</i> #6.
- <i>Hulk</i> #6.

06:26.884 --> 06:27.984
Do you mind if I take it out?

06:28.018 --> 06:29.352
Go right ahead.

06:29.386 --> 06:31.020
He's not talking
about the comic, you know.

06:31.038 --> 06:33.272
[laughter]

06:33.323 --> 06:34.924
You know what's interesting
about this, Ming?

06:34.958 --> 06:36.376
I know he's popular right now.

06:36.427 --> 06:38.928
Back in the '60s, though,
when he was first introduced,

06:38.962 --> 06:40.346
He was such
a lame duck character

06:40.397 --> 06:42.798
That they cancelled his title.

06:42.816 --> 06:44.434
And then he appeared in
<i>Tales to Astonish...</i>

06:44.468 --> 06:45.435
That's right.

06:45.469 --> 06:46.853
Until they turned that mag

06:46.904 --> 06:48.471
Into <i>The Incredible Hulk.</i>

06:48.505 --> 06:51.774
The hulk we think of
as cg in the movies now--

06:51.792 --> 06:53.376
In <i>The Avengers,</i>
he looks amazing.

06:53.410 --> 06:54.744
The only way to do him justice

06:54.778 --> 06:56.963
Is to do him
as a big cg character,

06:56.997 --> 06:59.849
But back in the day, man,
Lou Ferrigno pulled it off

06:59.883 --> 07:02.752
With just green makeup,
and his damn self, you know?

07:02.786 --> 07:04.620
Just his body with the paint.

07:04.655 --> 07:07.073
Which I think is more
admirable to go in as--

07:07.124 --> 07:09.575
You built yourself
to perfection.

07:09.626 --> 07:11.961
You look like a human hulk
if you're painted green.

07:11.995 --> 07:14.764
Oh, go on.
[laughter]

07:14.798 --> 07:15.865
Where'd you get this at?

07:15.899 --> 07:18.768
I purchased this
as part of a collection

07:18.802 --> 07:20.570
Better than 10 years ago.

07:20.604 --> 07:22.705
Tried to sell it on eBay
without any luck.

07:22.740 --> 07:23.706
Don't think that I can get

07:23.741 --> 07:25.992
A fair price for it these days.

07:26.043 --> 07:27.994
Plus it's taking up a lot
of room where he sleeps.

07:28.045 --> 07:30.296
[laughter]

07:30.330 --> 07:31.964
I do represent
the lollipop guild.

07:31.999 --> 07:33.082
[groaning]

07:33.116 --> 07:35.451
- Card carrying member?
- Absolutely.

07:35.469 --> 07:36.619
Well, what are you
looking to get

07:36.653 --> 07:38.688
For <i>Incredible Hulk</i> #6?

07:38.722 --> 07:41.374
I would like
to get $500 for it.

07:41.408 --> 07:44.761
Okay, because, I mean, you can
see there's a rip right here.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.962
I don't know
what that is right there.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.064
[laughter]

07:48.098 --> 07:50.533
There's stain right there.

07:50.551 --> 07:51.784
[mimicking hulk]
Hulk make b.M.

07:51.835 --> 07:56.205
[laughter]

07:56.240 --> 07:58.007
Green and brown
just don't go together.

07:58.041 --> 08:00.910
I could give you $200.

08:00.944 --> 08:02.428
- Two and a half?
- $210.

08:02.463 --> 08:06.082
$210, and that is my final--
my final offer.

08:06.116 --> 08:10.553
- Can you do $215?
- $215?

08:10.571 --> 08:12.054
All right, I can do $215.

08:12.089 --> 08:13.589
You got yourself a deal.
All right.

08:13.624 --> 08:14.891
For those of you
that don't read the book,

08:14.925 --> 08:17.059
And we all think of
the ever-loving hulk as green,

08:17.094 --> 08:18.928
He started as gray originally.

08:18.962 --> 08:20.730
How many issues
before he became green?

08:20.764 --> 08:21.731
One.

08:21.765 --> 08:23.132
In the comics, did they explain

08:23.150 --> 08:25.701
Why he went from green to gray,
or gray to green,

08:25.736 --> 08:27.653
Or was it just, like,
"it's cheaper to go green?"

08:27.688 --> 08:29.372
No, I remember reading

08:29.406 --> 08:31.908
Some sort of, like,
interview with stan.

08:31.942 --> 08:33.226
It was just--
they just were like,

08:33.260 --> 08:34.559
"hey, he looks better green.
Let's go with green.

08:34.595 --> 08:35.561
We don't need to explain it."

08:35.596 --> 08:36.562
Could you imagine if you tried

08:36.613 --> 08:37.679
To get away with that today?

08:37.698 --> 08:39.115
Like, "Batman's pink
this month."

08:39.149 --> 08:41.417
- [laughs]
- "Let's just see if it rolls."

08:41.451 --> 08:43.452
[laughter]

08:55.766 --> 08:57.466
Do you think it would be cool
if I asked a couple questions?

08:57.501 --> 08:59.335
You may not get a chance
to ask any of your questions.

08:59.369 --> 09:00.703
I've got so many of my own.
Really?

09:00.737 --> 09:03.539
Yeah, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

09:03.573 --> 09:05.741
I mean, we got this place
closed down.

09:05.759 --> 09:07.376
We've basically got him
to ourselves.

09:07.410 --> 09:09.511
But no, you can't
ask any questions

09:09.530 --> 09:10.563
In this once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

09:10.614 --> 09:11.747
I mean, it's like, literally,

09:11.765 --> 09:13.716
Like being in a prison cell
with Stan Lee.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.818
He can't go anywhere.
Oh, yeah?

09:15.853 --> 09:17.103
[laughs]

09:17.154 --> 09:18.437
[mock spits]

09:18.488 --> 09:20.373
[laughter]

09:20.407 --> 09:23.726
I don't give a crap
about <i>Spider-Man.</i>

09:23.760 --> 09:27.230
Let's do the list
of Stan Lee's creations.

09:27.264 --> 09:30.266
Spider-Man, Hulk...
- Yes.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.034
- Iron man...
- Yes.

09:32.052 --> 09:33.803
All the avengers.

09:33.837 --> 09:35.171
Except captain america.

09:35.205 --> 09:36.906
That's right.
All right, cap's not his.

09:36.940 --> 09:39.075
The x-men.
- Yes.

09:39.109 --> 09:41.377
Fantastic four.

09:41.395 --> 09:43.212
- I mean, come on.
- The list goes on and on.

09:43.213 --> 09:44.213
What are we gonna do?

09:44.248 --> 09:45.298
Are we going
to stay in here all day

09:45.332 --> 09:46.582
And just list
Stan's characters?

09:46.617 --> 09:50.102
[laughter]

09:51.521 --> 09:53.355
Hey, he's here!
He's here!

09:53.373 --> 09:54.540
How are you?
All right, glad to see you.

09:54.575 --> 09:56.208
Thank--thank you
for coming down.

09:56.243 --> 09:57.577
- What's your name?
- My name is ming.

09:57.628 --> 09:59.462
- Hey, good to meet you, ming.
- Good to meet you.

09:59.496 --> 10:00.463
Where do I go?

10:00.497 --> 10:02.381
Uh, right back here.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.500
I'll follow you.

10:04.534 --> 10:07.086
Hey, what a great place.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.372
Okay, so what have you
got in store for me here?

10:09.406 --> 10:11.407
Uh, a photo shoot set up.
Guys, this is Stan Lee.

10:11.425 --> 10:14.460
Look at all--all those
hostile-looking guys.

10:14.511 --> 10:15.962
Mr. Lee, it's an honor.

10:16.013 --> 10:17.380
Nice to meet you.
Thank you.

10:17.414 --> 10:18.747
- Mr. Lee.
- It's a pleasure.

10:18.765 --> 10:20.049
Pleasure's all mine.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.417
Stan Lee doesn't care about me.

10:21.435 --> 10:22.768
- Oh, hey!
- He doesn't care about me.

10:22.803 --> 10:23.769
- Hello there.
- Hey, mr. Lee.

10:23.804 --> 10:24.854
How are you doing?

10:24.888 --> 10:26.389
Didn't have time
to shave today.

10:26.423 --> 10:28.590
[laughter]
- or yesterday.

10:28.609 --> 10:30.493
Or the day before.

10:30.527 --> 10:31.827
I just wanted you
to take a look

10:31.845 --> 10:32.828
At something I brought I

10:32.863 --> 10:33.829
- Okay.
- Wow.

10:33.863 --> 10:34.897
Very nice.

10:34.932 --> 10:36.098
I've heard of this book selling

10:36.133 --> 10:39.118
For as much as $35,000.

10:41.672 --> 10:43.105
People celebrate George Lucas,

10:43.140 --> 10:46.242
And Roddenberry,
the guy that created <i>Star Trek.</i>

10:46.260 --> 10:49.245
Stan Lee has 'em beat
by a thousand miles.

10:49.279 --> 10:52.048
You know, like, Stan Lee
created the characters

10:52.082 --> 10:53.649
That fueled the imagination

10:53.684 --> 10:57.220
Of the next five generations
of filmmakers.

10:57.254 --> 10:59.772
If you take, like, a poster
of the Marvel universe,

10:59.806 --> 11:01.157
And just throw a dart,

11:01.191 --> 11:03.709
You're gonna hit a character
that Stan Lee created.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.578
And a character
that's gone on now

11:05.629 --> 11:08.531
To, um, generate
billions of dollars now

11:08.565 --> 11:10.733
With the movies,
the merchandise.

11:10.767 --> 11:14.403
I mean, he is
the cool walt disney.

11:14.438 --> 11:15.421
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:15.455 --> 11:17.173
I'd go with that, absolutely.

11:17.207 --> 11:18.541
Somewhere, Walt Disney
is just like--

11:18.575 --> 11:21.611
[laughter]

11:21.645 --> 11:24.914
Walt Disney also created
some very iconic characters,

11:24.948 --> 11:27.133
But, you know, males, you know,

11:27.184 --> 11:29.785
Want to, uh, you know--
they want to be alpha males.

11:29.803 --> 11:32.621
They don't want to wear Pluto,
or Goofy, or Donald Duck.

11:32.639 --> 11:35.758
They want to wear Spider-Man,
and the Hulk, Wolverine.

11:35.792 --> 11:36.859
You know, cool stuff.

11:36.894 --> 11:38.077
Oh, and you look cool.

11:38.111 --> 11:40.930
[laughter]

11:50.930 --> 11:52.096
So what do you guys think

11:52.131 --> 11:54.732
Is the weirdest super villain
ever created?

11:54.767 --> 11:56.401
Uh, I think when I was a kid,

11:56.435 --> 11:57.502
It was Stilt-Man.

11:57.536 --> 11:59.203
Just Stilt-Man
always bothered me.

11:59.238 --> 12:00.405
I could never understand

12:00.439 --> 12:02.240
Why Daredevil just wouldn't
knock him over.

12:02.274 --> 12:04.642
He had some sort of Gyro,
like, mechanical thing

12:04.660 --> 12:06.778
On his back that made it
so he was never off-balance.

12:06.812 --> 12:08.029
Yeah, but still,
he could knock him over.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.414
I mean, you could trip him.

12:09.448 --> 12:11.699
You could tie his shoelaces
together so he could fall.

12:11.750 --> 12:12.984
You're getting like
Bugs Bunny now.

12:13.018 --> 12:14.385
- How are you doing?
- Need some help?

12:14.420 --> 12:15.753
Uh, I just wanted you
to take a look

12:15.788 --> 12:16.754
At something I brought in.

12:16.789 --> 12:17.755
Okay.

12:17.790 --> 12:18.990
I don't know if you guys

12:19.008 --> 12:20.258
Have a lot
of golden age comics.

12:20.292 --> 12:21.376
We get 'em occasionally.

12:21.427 --> 12:24.679
It's a <i>Planet Comics</i>#1.

12:24.730 --> 12:26.064
- Wow.
- Very nice.

12:33.472 --> 12:36.107
♪ 1 <i>Planet Comics.</i>
Great book.

12:36.141 --> 12:37.692
Probably the cornerstone

12:37.726 --> 12:41.095
Of the '40s, '50s
science fiction fandom.

12:41.130 --> 12:42.764
I mean, this is a trendsetter.

12:42.798 --> 12:45.850
So this book is almost
70-odd years old, right?

12:45.884 --> 12:48.136
And for being that old,
it has a remarkable amount

12:48.170 --> 12:49.420
Of condition still within it.

12:49.454 --> 12:50.722
The colors are bright.
- Yeah.

12:50.756 --> 12:52.523
Not to mention
it's an awesome cover.

12:52.558 --> 12:53.825
How'd you come by this book?

12:53.859 --> 12:55.660
Actually, it was a find.

12:55.694 --> 12:58.396
I was at a big comic con,
and just, you know, head down,

12:58.414 --> 12:59.747
Looking through the boxes
for three days,

12:59.782 --> 13:01.499
And I think I got
a pretty good deal on it,

13:01.517 --> 13:02.634
And being that it's a #1,

13:02.668 --> 13:04.218
It could be worth up to--

13:04.269 --> 13:05.770
I've heard--actually heard
of this book selling

13:05.788 --> 13:08.156
For as much as $35,000, but--

13:08.207 --> 13:10.508
$35,000 for this comic?

13:10.526 --> 13:12.777
Yes, #35,000,

13:12.795 --> 13:15.613
But this book

13:15.647 --> 13:18.149
Is not <i>Planet Comics</i> #1.

13:18.183 --> 13:20.351
This is the canadian edition

13:20.369 --> 13:23.121
Of <i>Planet Comics</i> #1,

13:23.155 --> 13:24.121
But I didn't even
notice that, at first,

13:24.139 --> 13:25.390
When I found the book.

13:25.424 --> 13:27.091
You know, I got excited,
thought it was a #1.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.960
- I would get excited too...
- Sure.

13:28.994 --> 13:31.929
But it actually
was printed in 1947.

13:31.964 --> 13:35.833
It is actually mostly
a reprint of issue #62.

13:35.868 --> 13:38.603
I mean, I think this book,
at a show,

13:38.637 --> 13:41.139
Maybe, like, a new york
convention on a back wall,

13:41.173 --> 13:43.241
$250 would be
a good asking price.

13:43.275 --> 13:44.826
Well, what are you looking for
for a cash offer?

13:44.860 --> 13:46.861
[exhales]

13:49.031 --> 13:51.199
Honestly, I think a buck 50.

13:51.233 --> 13:55.219
I, um-- I can't do $150 on it.

13:55.254 --> 13:57.238
$100.

14:00.426 --> 14:01.492
$125?

14:01.527 --> 14:03.978
I mean, the cover alone,
you know,

14:04.012 --> 14:05.196
Really is just a wall hanger.

14:05.214 --> 14:07.298
It really is.

14:07.332 --> 14:09.667
$115, and that's about--

14:09.701 --> 14:13.354
That's as good
as I can go on it.

14:13.389 --> 14:14.839
All right, let's do it.
$115.

14:14.857 --> 14:17.075
All right.
You got a deal.

14:17.109 --> 14:19.861
That's $115.

14:19.912 --> 14:20.978
Thanks a lot, guys.

14:21.013 --> 14:22.647
Both: Thank you.
Thank you very much.

14:22.681 --> 14:23.998
Thank you.
Take care.

14:24.049 --> 14:25.049
So what do you think?
Good pick up?

14:25.084 --> 14:26.250
I think it's beautiful, man.

14:26.284 --> 14:27.502
$115's a good price, right?

14:27.553 --> 14:29.270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:29.304 --> 14:30.438
Now look, and now, he's like,
"yeah, yeah, yeah."

14:30.472 --> 14:31.723
But you said 125.

14:31.757 --> 14:32.940
I got it for ten bucks less
than what you said.

14:32.975 --> 14:34.976
Well, $125!
I think it's a great pickup.

14:35.027 --> 14:36.611
I really do.
I like that book.

14:36.645 --> 14:38.312
It's beautiful.
The color on it's incredible.

14:38.363 --> 14:39.597
Are you interested in it?

14:39.631 --> 14:42.066
Yeah, I have to talk
to mrs. Bruce about that.

14:42.084 --> 14:44.068
Mrs. Bruce is wearing
the golden age pants, huh?

14:44.103 --> 14:45.069
Yep. Yep.

14:45.104 --> 14:46.304
[mimics whip]

14:46.338 --> 14:47.505
Come on, guys.

14:47.539 --> 14:49.006
[laughter]

14:49.041 --> 14:50.625
You're not too far behind me.

14:50.676 --> 14:52.677
[laughter]

14:55.114 --> 14:57.348
All right,
this is my heroic look.

15:02.654 --> 15:05.757
A little dr. Doom
feeling there, I hope.

15:05.791 --> 15:06.991
There, you got it.

15:07.025 --> 15:08.826
Eat your heart out, brad pitt.

15:08.861 --> 15:09.927
[chuckles]

15:09.962 --> 15:11.946
Imagine if Stan
worked at the store,

15:11.980 --> 15:13.247
That he was a staff member.

15:13.282 --> 15:14.932
[laughter]

15:14.967 --> 15:16.434
II can, and boy, oh, boy,

15:16.468 --> 15:18.302
I'd feel so bad for him.

15:18.337 --> 15:20.271
People come in the store,
and they're like,

15:20.305 --> 15:22.540
"didn't you create <i>Spider-Man?"</i>
[laughter]

15:22.574 --> 15:25.109
"I'm just helping out."

15:25.144 --> 15:26.894
He runs into the back room,
embarrassed.

15:26.945 --> 15:28.212
That would be a horrible thing.

15:28.247 --> 15:29.547
Well, guys.

15:29.581 --> 15:31.081
Tell me all about it.

15:31.099 --> 15:32.383
What's going on?
Do you need anything?

15:32.417 --> 15:33.417
A drink, anything?

15:33.435 --> 15:34.919
No, no.
Everything's fine.

15:34.937 --> 15:36.387
You've been great hosts.

15:36.421 --> 15:37.588
I'm having a good time.

15:37.606 --> 15:38.723
I love the store.

15:38.757 --> 15:40.007
Well, Stan, it's not every day

15:40.058 --> 15:42.527
That we have a legend
in the store like yourself.

15:42.561 --> 15:44.812
Yes, I imagine that's true.

15:44.863 --> 15:46.948
Would you mind if we had you
here for a couple seconds?

15:46.999 --> 15:49.951
You know, while you're waiting
for the photographer

15:50.002 --> 15:51.536
To set up the next shot,
if we, you know,

15:51.570 --> 15:52.904
Asked you a couple questions?

15:52.938 --> 15:55.739
Hey, you've been so flattering
that how can I mind?

15:55.757 --> 15:57.425
I know, it is an amazing talent

15:57.459 --> 15:58.909
To be able
to kiss your butt this much

15:58.927 --> 16:02.647
While you're sitting down.
[laughter]

16:02.681 --> 16:04.916
- First off--
- Okay.

16:04.950 --> 16:06.684
Don't make it difficult...
It's not difficult.

16:06.702 --> 16:08.686
'cause it's been a tough day.

16:08.704 --> 16:10.538
Keep the questions easy.

16:10.572 --> 16:13.708
Make sure they're ones
I know the answer to.

16:13.742 --> 16:15.560
Um, who really wins:

16:15.594 --> 16:17.995
Thor versus hulk?

16:18.030 --> 16:19.664
Oh, wow.

16:19.698 --> 16:22.900
What about Spider-Man?

16:22.935 --> 16:24.702
To me, that was one

16:24.736 --> 16:27.905
Of the most dramatic panels
in comics.

16:32.215 --> 16:34.616
Thor versus Hulk.

16:34.651 --> 16:36.251
Oh, wow.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.452
Who really wins?

16:37.487 --> 16:41.990
You know,
whenever two superheroes fight--

16:42.025 --> 16:44.225
Well, usually,
when you have two

16:44.243 --> 16:46.662
Of your own big characters,

16:46.696 --> 16:49.181
You try to make it end
in a draw

16:49.232 --> 16:53.652
So that the readers can spend
the rest of their lives arguing.

16:53.686 --> 16:56.238
"well, I think he won."
"no, I think he won,"

16:56.272 --> 16:58.407
And that keeps
the interest going,

16:58.441 --> 17:00.008
And that gets me off the hook.

17:00.043 --> 17:01.293
There's something really nice

17:01.327 --> 17:03.211
About being as old as we are,

17:03.246 --> 17:06.948
And still being able to get
a little like a little kid.

17:06.965 --> 17:09.084
Stan Lee still has the power

17:09.102 --> 17:12.371
To invoke in you
that same childlike reaction

17:12.405 --> 17:14.222
That you had--
a sense of wonder,

17:14.256 --> 17:16.058
For Spider-Man's dad.

17:16.092 --> 17:18.193
"this is Spider-Man's dad.
This is the Hulk's dad.

17:18.227 --> 17:19.627
This is Iron Man's dad."

17:19.662 --> 17:21.079
I don't know if you guys
could tell when I told you.

17:21.130 --> 17:22.714
I was pretty excited
when I broke the news.

17:22.749 --> 17:24.366
I could tell.
You were wearing sweat pants.

17:24.384 --> 17:26.801
[laughter]

17:26.836 --> 17:28.435
What about Spider-Man?

17:28.454 --> 17:30.038
Wait a second, I don't get
to ask any questions?

17:30.073 --> 17:31.189
No, no, no.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.641
You have to be annoyed
by being asked

17:32.675 --> 17:34.226
Nonstop comic nonsense,

17:34.260 --> 17:36.561
So here's a real question.

17:36.612 --> 17:37.729
I'm unlucky in love.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.014
What would you do
if you were me?

17:39.032 --> 17:42.367
You look like one of the most
well-adjusted guys here.

17:42.418 --> 17:44.036
You're happy.
You're calm.

17:44.087 --> 17:45.037
You're content.

17:45.088 --> 17:46.722
You do what you want to do.

17:46.756 --> 17:48.507
Stan needs to get
his prescription checked.

17:48.541 --> 17:49.758
[laughter]

17:49.792 --> 17:51.293
I'm sitting up here with Stan.

17:51.327 --> 17:53.428
All of a sudden, I'm sharing
the counter with somebody...

17:53.463 --> 17:54.930
All they do is put me down
all the time for my choices.

17:54.964 --> 17:56.598
With a guy bigger than me.

17:56.632 --> 17:58.216
They put me down
for my choices all the time,

17:58.267 --> 18:00.535
And you're here to tell me,
like, "I'm on the right track."

18:00.570 --> 18:02.571
But going back to Spider-Man,

18:02.605 --> 18:05.207
One of the most heartbreaking,
gut-wrenching,

18:05.241 --> 18:07.342
But yet fantastic story lines

18:07.377 --> 18:09.261
Was Captain Stacy's death.

18:09.312 --> 18:12.314
What were your thoughts
on those monumental events

18:12.348 --> 18:13.648
In Spider-Man's life?

18:13.683 --> 18:16.251
The death of Captain Stacy

18:16.285 --> 18:20.622
Was something I thought
the readers wouldn't expect,

18:20.656 --> 18:22.157
But it was the type of thing

18:22.175 --> 18:24.359
That could happen in real life.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.611
But what I liked best about it

18:26.646 --> 18:31.332
Was the very end,
when Captain Stacy was dying,

18:31.350 --> 18:34.136
And Spider-Man was there
with him

18:34.170 --> 18:37.355
Trying to save him,
but he couldn't save him,

18:37.390 --> 18:40.442
And Captain Stacy
looked up at Spider-Man,

18:40.476 --> 18:41.576
And with his dying breath...

18:41.611 --> 18:42.577
Oh!

18:42.612 --> 18:44.312
He said something like,

18:44.347 --> 18:48.283
"Take good care of her, Peter."

18:48.317 --> 18:50.869
And Peter knew that Stacy

18:50.903 --> 18:54.072
Had always known who he was.

18:54.123 --> 18:58.693
To me, that was one of the most
dramatic panels in comics--

18:58.728 --> 19:01.530
I love that--
or in anywhere, really.

19:01.564 --> 19:02.831
I thought that was good.

19:02.865 --> 19:04.166
Living legends is a term

19:04.200 --> 19:06.268
That's thrown around
an awful lot,

19:06.302 --> 19:08.270
And thrown around probably
in the wrong direction.

19:08.304 --> 19:10.489
I reserve the term for people

19:10.540 --> 19:11.623
That really deserve it,

19:11.657 --> 19:13.992
And Stan Lee is, to me,

19:14.026 --> 19:16.695
The modern day Mark Twain,

19:16.746 --> 19:19.714
The Samuel Olemens of comics,
if you will,

19:19.749 --> 19:22.334
The Will Rogers of four color.

19:22.368 --> 19:24.652
This man
has been the ambassador

19:24.670 --> 19:26.688
For the comic book community

19:26.722 --> 19:28.073
Almost since its inception,

19:28.107 --> 19:32.227
And still remains today
a tireless crusader

19:32.261 --> 19:34.563
For everything comics-related.

19:40.569 --> 19:42.871
- And react.
- [groans]

19:44.740 --> 19:45.991
- Awesome.
- Hey!

19:46.025 --> 19:47.609
- All right, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

19:47.643 --> 19:49.978
It was great meeting you,
really a pleasure.

19:49.996 --> 19:51.446
Oh, you can't stay
a little longer?

19:51.480 --> 19:52.581
- No!
- I ordered a pizza.

19:52.615 --> 19:53.682
I got soda pop coming.

19:53.716 --> 19:55.383
Enjoy the pizza.
Enjoy the soda pop.

19:55.401 --> 19:56.384
I have a thousand more
questions.

19:56.419 --> 19:58.170
I gotta go.

19:58.204 --> 19:59.821
Let me take care of this,
mr. Lee.

19:59.839 --> 20:02.190
I have to get back
in the real world!

20:02.225 --> 20:04.509
It was a pleasure, really.
Leave him alone.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.660
- See you guys.
- Bye, Stan.

20:05.694 --> 20:07.795
Love you all.
Thank you, it was a great time.

20:07.814 --> 20:08.797
Love you, too.
Thank you.

20:08.831 --> 20:10.665
I'm okay.
Hey, thank you.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.700
Bye, Stan!
Bye.

20:12.718 --> 20:13.718
- Bye!
- Hey!

20:13.753 --> 20:17.305
Stan Lee!

20:17.340 --> 20:18.773
Turned out he didn't
want to go to Atlantic City.

20:18.807 --> 20:21.626
[laughter]
- what a shock.

20:21.661 --> 20:23.678
There aren't many days
where I say this,

20:23.713 --> 20:25.096
But I wish I'd been there.

20:25.131 --> 20:26.598
I wish I had been
working the counter.

20:26.632 --> 20:27.749
I wish I'd have been
in the store.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.435
It sounds like you guys
had a Stan-tastic time,

20:30.469 --> 20:31.453
As they say.

20:31.487 --> 20:33.355
- A Marvel-ous time.
- Nice!

20:33.389 --> 20:34.556
[laughter]

20:34.590 --> 20:35.957
That's gonna wrap it up

20:35.975 --> 20:38.844
For another episode of
<i>Comic Book Men</i> this week, man.

20:38.895 --> 20:41.263
I'm, uh, Crushing Kev Smith.

20:41.297 --> 20:43.882
Uh, Bombastic Bryan Johnson.

20:43.933 --> 20:46.001
Winsome Walt Flanagan.

20:46.035 --> 20:47.802
[laughs]
Majestic Mike Zapcic.

20:47.837 --> 20:49.804
And Marauding Ming Chen.

20:49.839 --> 20:52.557
With great power
comes great responsibility.

20:52.592 --> 20:54.709
Excelsior, kids.
