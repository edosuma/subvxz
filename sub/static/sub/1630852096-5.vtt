WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.921
<i>Previously Discovery...</i>

00:08.965 --> 00:11.185
Welcome back
to Starfleet Academy.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.578
You want to go back, don't you?

00:13.622 --> 00:15.493
I do.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.585
You are doing a tremendous job,
Doctor.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.196
Serving as medical officer

00:22.239 --> 00:25.286
and ship's counselor
cannot be easy.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.810
Until I know what the DMA is,

00:27.853 --> 00:29.986
I can't predict its behavior.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.379
I'm gonna figure this thing out.

00:31.422 --> 00:32.510
For you.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.425
Whatever it takes.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.998
<i>This is USSJaneway
on approach with the DMA.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.609
<i>We're picking up
massive ionic fluctuations.</i>

00:44.653 --> 00:47.090
<i>Any other vessels in the area?
Confirm.</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:49.484
<i>NSST'Pau here.</i>

00:49.527 --> 00:51.181
<i>Confirming the same.</i>

00:51.225 --> 00:55.011
<i>I'm also getting a strange spike
in X-ray radiation.</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:56.143
<i>What is...</i>

00:56.186 --> 00:57.970
T'Pau, <i>are you seeing this?</i>

00:58.014 --> 00:59.059
<i>I am.</i>

01:02.497 --> 01:03.976
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

01:04.020 --> 01:04.977
<i>The DMA's just...</i>

01:05.021 --> 01:07.458
It's... gone.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.981
You talking to yourself again

01:09.025 --> 01:11.593
or you looking
for some sort of response?

01:11.636 --> 01:13.986
The DMA's gone
from the Venari sector.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.946
It just... It disappeared.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.339
That's impossible.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.036
Nothing in space
just disappears.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.520
And it's back.

01:26.521 --> 01:30.438
The DMA reappeared
4.2 seconds later,

01:30.481 --> 01:32.875
1,000 light-years away.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.966
Can we confirm it's the same DMA
we've been studying?

01:37.009 --> 01:39.708
The scan data matches exactly.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.537
And the odds
of an identical anomaly forming

01:42.580 --> 01:44.365
are essentially nil.

01:44.408 --> 01:45.757
Not to mention

01:45.801 --> 01:47.542
natural phenomena
do not disappear

01:47.585 --> 01:49.283
and reappear elsewhere.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.980
Doesn't that violate
the laws of physics?

01:51.023 --> 01:53.243
Every law we know of, that is.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.115
Zora,

01:55.158 --> 01:57.378
cross-reference all historical
records in the sphere data.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.162
Are there any indications
that this could have been due

01:59.206 --> 02:01.164
to some kind of natural event?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.731
<i>Negative, Captain.</i>

02:03.862 --> 02:06.909
If this isn't natural...

02:06.952 --> 02:10.391
the only logical explanation

02:10.434 --> 02:13.089
is someone created it.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.138
Who?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.750
Who would do this?

02:21.793 --> 02:23.230
<i>It's now on a path</i>

02:23.273 --> 02:25.101
toward the Radvek asteroid belt.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.234
It's formerly
an Emerald Chain colony.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.888
It's inhabited primarily
by the Akaali species.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.760
The current heading of the DMA
puts it right at the edge

02:31.803 --> 02:33.196
of the impact zone.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.589
One degree one way or another
could lead

02:34.632 --> 02:35.894
to safety or death.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.767
Problem is,
we won't know if it'll hit

02:38.810 --> 02:42.118
until after interference from
the DMA's dark matter signature

02:42.162 --> 02:44.860
has already made transport
impossible.

02:44.903 --> 02:49.212
So we've got to get
everyone off-world before then.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.257
How long do we have?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.345
Four hours.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.476
That's the cut-off point, sir.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.826
Begin evacuations immediately.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.655
They may not be
Federation members, but...

02:57.699 --> 02:59.222
we're the only body
with the ability

02:59.266 --> 03:01.485
to execute a mission
of this size.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.487
I'll send every vessel
in the area,

03:03.531 --> 03:05.185
and I'll need <i>Discovery
to jump there, too.</i>

03:05.228 --> 03:07.187
I'll lead the operation myself.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.145
Admiral, i-if I may,

03:09.189 --> 03:11.278
are there plans to address
the panic that may arise

03:11.321 --> 03:14.498
as it becomes known this is
not a natural phenomenon?

03:14.542 --> 03:17.284
President Rillak is meeting
with planetary leaders right now

03:17.327 --> 03:18.415
to get ahead of it.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.896
Ah. I am relieved to hear that.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.377
I've already received a call
from the Kaminar High Council.

03:23.420 --> 03:28.251
The-the fear in their voices
was... unmistakable.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.166
They are desperate for answers.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.646
We all are.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.169
Most important being

03:33.213 --> 03:34.910
who's behind this anomaly.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.391
Federation Security
has identified

03:37.434 --> 03:38.914
a number of civilizations

03:38.957 --> 03:41.743
that may possess technology
this advanced.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.485
The Metrons, the Nacene,

03:44.528 --> 03:47.488
the surviving members
of the Iconian empire.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.577
The Q Continuum
were considered as well.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.188
But as there has been no contact
for 600 years

03:52.232 --> 03:54.364
and this is unlike anything
they've done before,

03:54.408 --> 03:56.061
we don't believe it's them.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.715
For now, we're classifying

03:57.759 --> 04:01.893
those responsible
as Unknown Species Ten-C.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.330
The 10-C.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.070
Admiral, it seems to me

04:05.114 --> 04:08.291
the first step would be
to figure out how the DMA works.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.337
Then we can trace the tech back
to its creators,

04:10.380 --> 04:11.773
whoever they are.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.122
That's my thought exactly.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.776
Which is why I've asked
Ruon Tarka

04:14.819 --> 04:16.647
to advise us.
He's been heading a number

04:16.691 --> 04:18.170
of our scientific endeavors.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.781
Including the next generation
spore drive,

04:19.824 --> 04:21.217
if I'm not mistaken.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.132
He's working with Aurellio
on that one.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.439
They still haven't solved
the navigator problem.

04:25.482 --> 04:28.398
So without me or Book,
it's useless.

04:28.442 --> 04:32.010
If anyone can find a way,
it's Tarka.

04:32.054 --> 04:35.013
His expertise will serve us well
with the DMA, too.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.407
With all due respect,

04:37.451 --> 04:39.670
I already have
the people I need.

04:39.714 --> 04:42.717
Between myself and the other
task force scientists...

04:42.760 --> 04:45.981
We require someone at
the bleeding edge of Federation

04:46.024 --> 04:49.985
and non-Federation technology,
Commander.

04:50.028 --> 04:52.292
I'm sure you'll find him
a valuable asset.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.250
He'll board <i>Discovery
immediately.</i>

04:54.294 --> 04:56.165
You can get him caught up
on your work.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.862
Mr. Saru,

04:57.906 --> 04:59.386
since you will have the conn

04:59.429 --> 05:02.345
while Captain Burnham leads
the evacuation,

05:02.389 --> 05:05.087
please make sure Mr. Tarka
gets whatever he needs.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.480
Yes, sir.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.308
Keep me posted, Captain.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.048
Yes, sir.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.140
We're doing everything we can
to figure out the DMA.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.142
We need to do more, Michael.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.667
We need to find out
who's behind this and stop them.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.930
We will. We will, Book.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.540
I know this isn't easy,
any of it,

05:23.584 --> 05:25.107
but let's focus on today.

05:25.150 --> 05:28.023
And what is possible...

05:28.066 --> 05:30.939
today, right now...

05:30.982 --> 05:33.550
is saving lives on Radvek V.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.986
Let me help with that.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.727
Come on.

05:36.771 --> 05:39.208
I have to do something.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.688
At least I can make sure

05:40.731 --> 05:42.907
no one else
has to go through what I did.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.214
Okay.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.826
Mr. Saru, status update?

05:48.870 --> 05:52.264
Uh, three Federation ships
have reached Radvek V.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.484
And Ruon Tarka is now on board.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.878
I will see to him
once we've made the jump.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.619
All right.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.797
Lieutenant Christopher,
open a shipwide channel, please.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.451
Channel's open.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.017
Attention, all crew,

06:06.061 --> 06:09.412
our mission today
is to evacuate all inhabitants

06:09.456 --> 06:11.371
of the Radvek chain.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.373
<i>At this point,
we are not certain</i>

06:13.416 --> 06:15.331
<i>whether the DMA will hit.</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:17.855
<i>What we do know is that,
in three and a half hours,</i>

06:17.899 --> 06:20.858
<i>all transport off-world
will become impossible.</i>

06:20.902 --> 06:22.817
<i>So that's all the time
we've got.</i>

06:22.860 --> 06:25.297
We need to make sure
every minute counts.

06:25.341 --> 06:28.736
The inhabitants of Radvek V
are counting on us.

06:31.478 --> 06:34.742
Let's go save some lives.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.271
What's the situation
on the ground?

08:09.314 --> 08:10.664
There are 1,206 individuals

08:10.707 --> 08:14.145
on the colony's surface
to be evacuated.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.191
Lieutenant Christopher,
contact the magistrate.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.541
Commander Nilsson, have a team
prepare the Deck Four

08:18.585 --> 08:20.282
loading bay for refugees.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.979
We'll have them beam up
and then facilitate transport

08:22.023 --> 08:23.851
- to the other ships.
- Aye, Captain.

08:23.894 --> 08:26.331
The array can only beam
40 at a time.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.117
- It's gonna be close.
- We do our best work
when it's close.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.120
I'm quoting you, by the way.
That nitrium delivery on Oonla.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.861
Luckily, this time,
there's no noodle stalls

08:33.904 --> 08:35.471
for you to blow up.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.517
Hey, you were
on demolition duty. Not me.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.866
Captain,

08:38.909 --> 08:39.997
I have the magistrate
on comms for you.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.129
Put him through.

08:42.913 --> 08:46.177
Magistrate, I'm Captain Burnham
of the USS <i>Discovery.</i>

08:46.221 --> 08:47.570
Thank Draylan you're here.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.441
We sent off all available ships;

08:49.485 --> 08:51.356
they held scarcely a quarter
of our population.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.968
All the rest are waiting.
They've begun to panic.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.144
I'll send a team down to assist.
We will get everyone out.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.102
Captain, we are seeing
six life signs

08:58.146 --> 08:59.626
beneath the north
dome generator.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.453
They are remaining stationary,

09:01.497 --> 09:03.499
far from the evacuation point.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.675
Are you aware
of these individuals?

09:05.719 --> 09:07.590
Of course.
They are The Examples.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.418
Records show

09:09.461 --> 09:11.463
it is the colony's prison.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.204
They need to be evacuated
immediately.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.902
Why? They're criminals.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.991
Six offenders chosen
to demonstrate

09:17.034 --> 09:18.427
the costs of misbehavior.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.037
An Emerald Chain tradition.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.126
It has proven most effective
in preventing crime.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.607
It doesn't matter who they are,
they don't deserve to die there.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.218
This is a Federation mission,
Magistrate.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.829
No one will be left behind.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.353
It's too late.
The prison is automated.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.921
And the few who know
how to run it fled hours ago.

09:33.964 --> 09:37.315
The law-abiding among us
await you.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.971
Mr. Saru, assemble a team
to help with the evacuation.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.758
Book and I will go
to the prison ourselves.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.324
Excuse me, Captain?

09:46.368 --> 09:49.719
I'd like to volunteer to lead
the evac team.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.373
I think I could be helpful.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.722
All right, Commander.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.028
Take whoever you need
and get going.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.507
Captain, the prison

09:55.551 --> 09:57.597
is protected
by a pattern interrupter,

09:57.640 --> 10:00.208
which prevents
both transport and comms

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
within a half-kilometer radius.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.254
Understood.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.605
Let's go.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.738
Hi.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.567
Ruon Tarka's here
to work with me,

10:11.611 --> 10:14.352
figured I should put on
a clean jacket.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.703
Apparently,
he's some kind of genius.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.052
We'll see.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.967
Wait, Ruon Tarka,
isn't he the one...

10:20.010 --> 10:21.577
Yeah, building off
of my research

10:21.621 --> 10:24.319
and hasn't once made the effort
to reach out.

10:24.362 --> 10:28.323
Yeah, I've advised his team
on, uh, spore propagation,

10:28.366 --> 10:30.934
on not harming the JahSepp.

10:30.978 --> 10:35.591
I've supplied them with
countless samples of my DNA.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.856
But Tarka is always
too busy for me.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.424
He goes through Aurellio
every time.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.731
How do I work with someone
who has zero respect

10:44.774 --> 10:46.384
for professional courtesy?

10:46.428 --> 10:48.648
Let it roll off you.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.868
There are bigger things
at stake here.

10:51.912 --> 10:55.176
Good luck. I'm off
to assist with the evacuees.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.352
Hey. You've already done, what,

10:57.395 --> 11:00.572
like, five therapy sessions
today?

11:00.616 --> 11:05.142
Maybe you could take ten minutes
before you jump into one again?

11:05.186 --> 11:07.014
People need help, Paul.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.844
Knowing that someone
made the DMA

11:10.887 --> 11:13.455
makes it all
the more unsettling.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.283
For everyone.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.589
Can I give <i>you</i> some advice,
though?

11:17.633 --> 11:21.071
I'm good. Really.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.953
<i>...Ensign Jameson,
please report to Observation.</i>

11:32.996 --> 11:35.346
So, this is the USS <i>Discovery.</i>

11:35.390 --> 11:37.697
It's like walking
onto an antique.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.394
Ah.

11:39.437 --> 11:42.049
Mr. Tarka, welcome aboard.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.312
Uh, this is Commander Stamets.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.096
Nice to finally meet you.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.750
Aurellio's told me
all about you.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.883
And of course, I've studied
your work extensively.

11:49.926 --> 11:53.321
So much to admire,
and improve upon.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.758
So what are we waiting for?
Let's get started.

11:55.802 --> 11:59.544
- DMA awaits.
- Uh, if you will both follow me.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.722
- You're the first Kelpien
I've ever met.
- Ah.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.550
You really do have
the strangest feet.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.472
<i>Burnham toDiscovery.</i>

12:14.516 --> 12:16.257
<i>We're approaching
the prison now.</i>

12:16.300 --> 12:17.780
We'll be passing through
the boundary marker

12:17.824 --> 12:20.609
for the pattern interrupter
in just a moment.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.654
That will take us
out of comms range,

12:22.698 --> 12:24.526
<i>Aye, Captain. Good luck.</i>

12:24.569 --> 12:27.355
Rhys, what's the status
of the evacuation?

12:27.398 --> 12:30.184
160 transported so far.

12:30.227 --> 12:33.491
Bit chaotic at first, but
everything's going smoothly now.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.884
Good. Book and I are going dark.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.407
Don't wait for us.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.887
We'll be out of here
before the cut-off point.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.281
Captain, thank you
for letting me do this.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.109
I can tell it means
a lot to you.

12:42.152 --> 12:46.461
My town was wiped out
by a hurricane when I was five.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.029
A Starfleet crew got us out.

12:49.072 --> 12:52.206
So, I get what this is like
for them.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.512
I'm glad you're here, Commander.

12:56.427 --> 12:57.646
Let's do this.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.434
Okay, the door is standard
Emerald Chain issue.

13:03.478 --> 13:04.696
I can open it no problem.

13:04.740 --> 13:05.785
- Such confidence.
- What can I say?

13:05.828 --> 13:07.177
I'm a man of many talents.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.484
I'm not picking up
any defense systems.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.833
There must be some.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.880
Yeah, I don't trust it, either.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.752
By the way, about Oonla,

13:16.796 --> 13:18.406
you do realize it was either
the noodle stands

13:18.449 --> 13:20.190
or the fusion reactor?

13:20.234 --> 13:22.540
Mm-hmm, I was picking noodles
out of my braids for days.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.020
Simpler times.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.456
Constantly running
for our lives doing

13:25.500 --> 13:26.762
borderline-legal courier gigs?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.764
- That was simpler?
- In some ways.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.548
Though I don't miss the whole
"just friends" thing.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.463
I was keeping it professional.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.423
Which was absolutely zero fun
for either of us.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.123
The hell is that?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.603
It's a Narisa beetle.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.300
They're indigenous
to the Akaali.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.737
They must have brought them
when they settled here.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.652
- I could not hate
that sound more.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.916
- You mean the chitin?
- No idea what word
you just said.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.527
Chitin. The polysaccharides
in arthropod exoskeletons.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.529
It creates
a distinctive clicking.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.096
Whatever. It creeps me out.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.793
Says the man who finds
beauty in Tranceworms.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.926
Why can't you just ask it
to go away?

13:59.969 --> 14:02.450
I'm trying to.
I can't communicate with it.

14:02.493 --> 14:05.279
It's taken the exact
same path four times now.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.020
No living thing is that precise.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.935
Let's see what
we're dealing with.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.338
It's a mobile land mine.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.949
I've heard the Emerald Chain

14:22.992 --> 14:25.386
use weapons like this,
disguised as native life.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.388
There's a lot more
coming this way.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.564
These are scans
from the precise moment

14:29.607 --> 14:30.957
the DMA disappeared.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.916
It collapsed
into a central aperture.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.919
What appears to be some sort
of, uh, technological device?

14:36.963 --> 14:39.269
Which then disappeared as well.

14:39.313 --> 14:43.099
We assume this is what also
is controlling the DMA

14:43.143 --> 14:44.492
in its new location.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.015
The scans further indicate

14:46.059 --> 14:48.322
the DMA left behind
a subspace rupture.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.150
Yes, yes, yes.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.326
I've already seen this data.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.110
It's inconclusive.

14:54.154 --> 14:57.026
Subspace damage can be created
by a litany of things.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.723
Of course.
I was about to say that,

14:58.767 --> 15:00.029
- but you cut me off.
- For something so powerful,

15:00.073 --> 15:01.726
it's an exceedingly blunt
instrument.

15:01.770 --> 15:06.122
Uh, we, too, have wondered
about its, uh, purpose.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.037
Is it a weapon, perhaps,

15:08.081 --> 15:10.997
or, uh, clearing areas of space
in preparation for something?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.782
- Uh, is it...
- Where's the replicator in here?

15:13.825 --> 15:15.349
That console.

15:16.698 --> 15:20.484
Make me a plate
of mashed potatoes, cold.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.660
And a pea. Just one.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.401
We're on a clock here.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.837
- So if you need
to eat something...

15:30.016 --> 15:33.019
These potatoes are the DMA.

15:33.062 --> 15:36.892
A mass of dark matter
and accreted material

15:36.936 --> 15:41.288
moving through space,
wreaking havoc,

15:41.331 --> 15:45.031
controlled somehow by the device
at its center.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.602
What does it all add up to?

15:51.646 --> 15:54.866
You originally theorized
primordial wormhole.

15:54.910 --> 15:58.000
- Obviously, that's wrong.
- Had I known about the device...

15:58.044 --> 16:00.176
I didn't say "completely wrong."

16:00.220 --> 16:02.222
The behavior of the anomaly

16:02.265 --> 16:04.485
suggests that the wormhole
is present.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.661
You think, what,
synthetic?

16:06.704 --> 16:09.272
I think someone created a tunnel
through space-time

16:09.316 --> 16:11.927
- to get it here.
- To what end?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.363
No idea.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.626
But we can sit around
doing math,

16:15.670 --> 16:18.586
or we can get our hands dirty
and find out.

16:18.629 --> 16:21.981
I am not sure I follow
your metaphor, Mr. Tarka.

16:22.024 --> 16:26.028
I want to create a working
model of the DMA controller.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.769
Miniature scale, of course.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.858
You really think
you can do that?

16:29.901 --> 16:33.340
Take a look at the schematics
if you want.

16:36.212 --> 16:41.087
You want to create a device
that will generate a wormhole

16:41.130 --> 16:43.611
- on <i>Discovery?
- Yeah, simulations</i>

16:43.654 --> 16:47.006
are promising,
but I need a real-world trial

16:47.049 --> 16:50.531
to confirm my theory and collect
the data that we need.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.707
For instance,
how much power will it require?

16:52.750 --> 16:55.362
Does it rupture subspace?

16:55.405 --> 16:58.234
Those answers will help lead us
to who's responsible.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.584
Wow, this is...

17:00.628 --> 17:02.499
It really could work.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.459
W-We can enclose both ends
of the wormhole

17:05.502 --> 17:07.113
inside a containment field.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.723
It'll be perfectly safe.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.334
I will give Commander Nilsson
the conn

17:11.378 --> 17:14.468
and personally supervise.

17:14.511 --> 17:17.036
We're gonna need a bigger room.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.910
Can't hold them off forever.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.694
They communicate using
a shared control matrix.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.087
I can access it
to stop their movements,

17:25.131 --> 17:26.306
but I need you to buy me
more time.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.177
More time, she says.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.879
You have got to be kidding me.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.448
Come on, Michael.

17:38.492 --> 17:39.536
I'm almost done.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.890
Now would be good.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.024
Got it.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.115
I told you I could do it.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.204
Never doubted you.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.946
Clock's ticking. We have
to get those prisoners out.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.208
Come on.

18:12.134 --> 18:16.312
Everyone up, please.
We need your attention.

18:16.356 --> 18:19.315
Who the hell are you?
And what's with the costume?

18:19.359 --> 18:21.448
I'm Captain Burnham
of the USS <i>Discovery.</i>

18:21.491 --> 18:24.015
This colony is in the path
of a gravitational anomaly.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.496
The other colonists are being
evacuated as we speak,

18:26.540 --> 18:28.150
so we are here to evacuate you.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.065
Now we know
why the guards took off.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.545
They left us here to die.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.286
Of course they did.

18:33.329 --> 18:37.028
Tell me, why would a Starfleet
captain come to help us?

18:37.072 --> 18:39.466
Because the Federation
doesn't leave prisoners to die.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.381
Is that so?

18:44.558 --> 18:47.213
Everyone here
is sentenced to life,

18:47.256 --> 18:49.563
no matter how small their crime.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.086
He stole food for his family.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.307
He traded
in counterfeit latinum.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.745
She counted cards
at a tongo club.

18:57.788 --> 19:02.880
And Felix took one joyride
on a sand-copter.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.666
Tell me how that's worth
30 years and counting.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.711
This is not a place of justice.

19:07.755 --> 19:10.410
And the Federation
has done nothing about it.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.151
This was Emerald Chain
territory.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.022
We had no jurisdiction.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.458
So now you care.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.634
We did then and we still do.

19:17.678 --> 19:18.853
We don't have time
for this, okay?

19:18.896 --> 19:20.376
We need to get everyone out.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.205
How long before
this gravitational anomaly hits?

19:23.249 --> 19:24.554
In a little over an hour,

19:24.598 --> 19:26.208
we lose the ability
to transport.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.558
We won't know its trajectory
until after that.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.125
So it may not hit us?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.822
That's right.
The plan is to beam you

19:31.866 --> 19:33.607
onto our ship until it's safe.

19:33.650 --> 19:37.176
Listen, we are risking
our own lives being here.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.655
Can we get moving?

19:44.487 --> 19:48.099
Good. Where is
your prison control system?

19:48.143 --> 19:49.884
On the basement level.

19:49.927 --> 19:53.192
But it has biometric protections
that only the guards can access.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.584
What about the force field
generator?

19:54.628 --> 19:56.543
Shut it off, our walls go down.

19:56.586 --> 19:59.110
That?

20:00.851 --> 20:02.201
The casing is quanarium alloy.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.898
It's one of the strongest metals
there is.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.595
It's also an excellent
heat conductor.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.728
K-value of 494.

20:07.771 --> 20:10.209
If we heat it up,
we could fry the system.

20:12.733 --> 20:13.908
How long do you think
it'll take?

20:13.951 --> 20:16.127
I have no idea.

20:16.171 --> 20:19.130
- Don't tell them that.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.658
I'm sorry,
we have to reschedule.

20:24.701 --> 20:27.226
There are others assisting
in your absence.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.097
You can spare ten minutes.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.317
You were the one who requested
this meeting.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.102
Yes, sir, but that was before
I knew about the evacuations.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.278
We have hundreds of refugees
coming on board.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.628
I'm a busy man, Dr. Culber.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.587
I cleared the time for you.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.023
We both know how this works.

20:42.066 --> 20:45.026
We can skip
the therapeutic niceties.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.245
What do you need?

20:47.811 --> 20:52.686
Well, you're familiar with
my duties as ship's counselor.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
And I saw how you were
with Georgiou

20:54.340 --> 20:56.298
when she was in crisis, so...

20:56.342 --> 20:59.083
You need brutal honesty. Noted.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.390
We now have
eight and a half minutes.

21:02.696 --> 21:06.003
Well, the DMA has brought up
a lot of, uh...

21:06.047 --> 21:10.660
fear and uncertainty
for the crew.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.404
So, I've...

21:15.448 --> 21:17.319
I've offered them hope.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.323
I told them that, uh,
it won't last forever,

21:21.367 --> 21:24.195
that... that we'll find a way
to stop it.

21:28.069 --> 21:31.333
I recently worked
with someone whose...

21:31.377 --> 21:34.293
entire world was destroyed.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.077
Mr. Booker.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.167
I almost admitted to him
that, uh...

21:41.778 --> 21:43.824
I'm struggling.

21:46.435 --> 21:51.701
And it made me realize
that, uh, I've been lying.

21:53.921 --> 21:57.228
To everyone who gets
in front of me.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.623
And now we find out that this
isn't an act of nature, that...

22:01.755 --> 22:05.498
...that someone chose to kill.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.587
Someone with staggering power.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.332
And whether I lie or I don't...

22:15.943 --> 22:18.380
...I am failing.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.383
And you want me to affirm
that you're failing,

22:21.427 --> 22:25.169
because you're seeking
permission to take a break?

22:26.910 --> 22:28.521
That's not what I said at all.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.653
Yes, it is.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.133
You know what?
This isn't helpful.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.614
- I got to go.
- You died.

22:35.745 --> 22:39.575
You died and came back to life.

22:39.619 --> 22:42.230
Little wonder you're a mess.

22:45.668 --> 22:49.455
Your file is stunningly generic
as to your feelings

22:49.498 --> 22:52.458
on this rather unique fact
of your existence,

22:52.501 --> 22:55.678
so allow me to fill in
some blanks.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.246
"Why me?"

22:58.289 --> 23:00.640
It's the question
you ask yourself

23:00.683 --> 23:03.294
every morning and every evening.

23:03.338 --> 23:07.603
"No one else gets
a second chance, so why me?"

23:07.647 --> 23:09.866
That led you to the idea

23:09.910 --> 23:14.001
that there was a reason
for your survival.

23:14.044 --> 23:17.831
A purpose you're meant to
fulfill right here, right now.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.921
And that led you
to a savior complex,

23:20.964 --> 23:25.273
because if there is no reason,
if there is no purpose,

23:25.316 --> 23:27.971
then your very existence
is a middle finger

23:28.015 --> 23:30.452
to anyone who's ever
lost someone.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.759
Which is everyone.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.674
How's that for brutal honesty?

23:36.676 --> 23:40.027
Do you have a recommendation

23:40.070 --> 23:42.943
to go along
with that sparkling analysis?

23:42.986 --> 23:47.643
Whether or not you were
a miracle, Dr. Culber,

23:47.687 --> 23:50.516
you are only human.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.344
You need to allow yourself
time to rest,

23:53.388 --> 23:56.217
as you advise your patients.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.524
Well, I can't just stop.

23:58.567 --> 24:01.091
Not now, anyway.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.876
It's what I do. It's...

24:02.919 --> 24:04.878
It's who I am. It's...

24:04.921 --> 24:06.923
It's the way you escape

24:06.967 --> 24:11.101
the persistent guilt
of being alive.

24:13.147 --> 24:16.716
This is a uniquely
challenging time, yes.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.109
But if you don't find
fulfillment in something

24:19.153 --> 24:22.591
other than work,
then you will fail those

24:22.635 --> 24:24.985
in the chair in front of you.

24:26.856 --> 24:29.468
I-I have a 2:00.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.731
Goodbye.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.998
Just a few more seconds.

24:38.041 --> 24:41.305
When this goes,
we need to move fast.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.700
I don't know about the rest
of you, but no way

24:44.744 --> 24:46.093
am I sitting in a brig
on some ship.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.398
I'm out of here.

24:48.748 --> 24:51.054
I can't let you do that.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.927
It's set to stun,
but it still won't feel good.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.930
All the colony's ships are gone.
We're your only way out.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.540
You can't ask us to trust you

24:58.584 --> 25:00.977
and then treat us no differently
than our jailers do.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.501
Lower your weapon.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.860
What happens
after you rescue us?

25:13.903 --> 25:15.644
Will we get our freedom?

25:15.688 --> 25:18.299
Because if we all walk out
right now,

25:18.342 --> 25:20.475
we'd have a chance
at precisely that.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.608
Maybe for an hour,
if you're lucky.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.348
Maybe we will be.

25:24.392 --> 25:27.221
If the anomaly doesn't hit,
we could use that time.

25:27.264 --> 25:30.485
- Find another way
off this asteroid.
- That is a big if.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.356
You haven't seen this thing.
You don't know what it can do.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.706
It destroyed my planet.

25:34.707 --> 25:37.536
They, whoever they are,

25:37.579 --> 25:39.973
they don't care
how many are killed.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.893
I'm sorry for your loss.

25:46.936 --> 25:49.069
But it changes nothing for us.

25:49.112 --> 25:51.114
I want a guarantee

25:51.158 --> 25:54.161
that we will not be returned
to this unjust society.

25:54.204 --> 25:55.989
I'll advocate for the diplomats
to put pressure...

25:56.032 --> 25:59.122
A guarantee, or we go nowhere.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.825
Okay, the controller model
is just ready to test.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.001
Activating containment field now.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.873
I can just picture
Tilly's face when she finds out

26:10.917 --> 26:12.222
that we got sucked
into a wormhole

26:12.266 --> 26:14.137
three days after she left.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.096
I miss her, too, Commander.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.358
We're ready for power.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.447
It's what I do best.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.928
Now, of course, the big
difference here apart from size

26:21.971 --> 26:23.625
is that the actual
DMA controller

26:23.669 --> 26:25.627
would have to use
an internal power source.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.543
Some sort of highly stable
energy-generating system

26:28.587 --> 26:31.764
far beyond
our technological capabilities.

26:31.807 --> 26:37.204
But the rest of it, I think I've
nailed pretty much perfectly.

26:37.247 --> 26:38.684
Here you go.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.773
It's working.

26:40.816 --> 26:44.080
- Incredible.
That looks
remarkably like the DMA.

26:44.124 --> 26:47.997
There's nothing quite like the
rush of proving a theory right.

26:49.303 --> 26:52.132
I remember my first time.
I was five years old.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.960
I atomized a live caracal.

26:54.003 --> 26:57.137
All anyone could do was complain
about how messy it was.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.792
I was never understood on Risa.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.968
The "pleasure planet."

27:02.011 --> 27:03.534
I was surrounded by idiots.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.059
Felt like your Gaily Leo
at the Inquisition.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.669
You mean Galileo?

27:07.713 --> 27:09.279
Sure. Why not?

27:09.323 --> 27:12.239
The point is,
great intellect can be costly.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.068
- You know, that's something
we have in common.
- Hmm?

27:15.111 --> 27:17.984
Your encounter
with the Emerald Chain.

27:18.027 --> 27:21.335
Neural lock. Painful.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.032
E-Excuse me.

27:23.076 --> 27:24.686
It appears the, uh,
experiment has paused.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.340
Let me see what I can do.

27:26.383 --> 27:29.517
Oh, I see the problem
right here.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.171
It's gonna require
much more power than I thought.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.651
Sorry, Galileo.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.000
I'm giving you all I can
without taking

27:34.043 --> 27:35.958
from the transport systems.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.830
Uh, which is not an option.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.135
There are evacuations
in progress.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.354
T-There's got to be

27:40.397 --> 27:42.095
somewhere else we can pull from.

27:42.138 --> 27:44.706
Come on, you love a challenge.

27:44.750 --> 27:48.318
I mean, I could harness
the ionic radiation

27:48.362 --> 27:50.712
from the main phaser array,

27:50.756 --> 27:53.541
converting it
into a temporary power source.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.108
Is that safe?

27:55.151 --> 27:58.589
Let's see, if one is
"nothing to worry about,"

27:58.633 --> 28:01.201
and ten is "insane," I would say

28:01.244 --> 28:04.944
it's, eh, it's probably a six?

28:04.987 --> 28:07.903
Great science was never
accomplished with caution.

28:07.947 --> 28:10.036
I'm not sure
that's actually true.

28:10.079 --> 28:12.865
Sir, if we can understand
this tech,

28:12.908 --> 28:14.867
then we can figure out
who built it.

28:14.910 --> 28:17.739
And maybe even how to stop it.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.872
Every piece of data is a clue.

28:19.915 --> 28:21.787
Commander, I do not believe
that you or Mr. Tarka

28:21.830 --> 28:24.224
are considering the risks
as seriously as you should.

28:24.267 --> 28:27.575
You realize it's a choice
to be this tense, right?

28:27.618 --> 28:30.404
Mr. Tarka, I have extraordinary
responsibilities on...

28:33.929 --> 28:35.670
What was that?

28:38.455 --> 28:40.457
Do it back.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.285
Excuse me?

28:42.329 --> 28:44.418
Yell back at me.

28:44.461 --> 28:45.724
What are you afraid of?

28:45.767 --> 28:47.726
- Do it!

28:53.775 --> 28:56.560
Well, that was something.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.693
That felt pretty good, right?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.651
Being out of control
for a moment?

29:00.695 --> 29:02.262
I suppose it did.

29:02.305 --> 29:05.874
Look, you may not like me,

29:05.918 --> 29:08.224
but-but I love me.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.966
And I am not gonna let
this experiment blow me up.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.968
Which means, by extension,

29:13.012 --> 29:15.144
that your ship
will be fine, too.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.972
Mr. Saru,

29:17.016 --> 29:18.974
for the first time
since we discovered the DMA,

29:19.018 --> 29:21.542
we're actually getting
somewhere.

29:21.585 --> 29:24.023
We'll keep this
within safe parameters.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.633
I'll make sure of it.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.729
I will allow
the additional power,

29:34.773 --> 29:37.950
but Commander Reno will give me
the ability to cut that power,

29:37.993 --> 29:40.517
should I deem it necessary.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.913
This is gonna be fun.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.176
Come on, Michael.
We have 30 minutes.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.962
Okay, I found something.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.921
I searched Starfleet
General Orders and Regulations.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.706
Protocol allows a captain
to grant political asylum

29:55.750 --> 29:57.360
in extreme circumstances.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.536
That would bring you
under Federation law.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.103
Your cases would go under
immediate review

30:01.147 --> 30:02.844
and your sentencing
would likely be commuted.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.541
How would we warrant asylum?

30:04.585 --> 30:06.587
The magistrate called you
The Examples.

30:06.630 --> 30:09.546
Your sentences were political
theater, they weren't justice.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.375
And if you also believe that
to be true, and you do want

30:12.419 --> 30:13.855
want your cases
reviewed by the Federation,

30:13.899 --> 30:16.597
I just need you to say that
right now.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.252
I want my case reviewed.
Absolutely.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.644
- So do I.
- Me, too.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.299
Then we're done here.

30:23.343 --> 30:24.735
- Let's get moving.
- Yes.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.694
I'll join you in a moment.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.093
What are you doing?

30:34.136 --> 30:35.703
There's something
I cannot leave.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.139
Whatever it is,
it's not worth it. We-we...

30:37.183 --> 30:38.227
It is to me.

30:40.621 --> 30:44.277
Unlike the others,
I do belong here.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.322
I'm not the man they think I am.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.107
I took a life.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.894
You do not shrink from me.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.504
I'm not here to judge you.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.345
When I took that life,

31:09.389 --> 31:12.392
I also took this.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.089
It's a lalogi orb.

31:14.133 --> 31:17.005
They're precious to the Akaali.
Each family has one.

31:17.049 --> 31:19.268
It contains a record
of their heritage.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.141
I kept it hidden from the guards
all these years,

31:22.184 --> 31:25.840
promising myself that somehow
I would return it.

31:25.884 --> 31:29.539
But of course,
now it's too late.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.281
I've devoted my life to doing
penance for my crime.

31:32.325 --> 31:35.937
One way is to help
the others here, however I can.

31:35.981 --> 31:40.159
I know that giving them asylum
may create difficulties for you,

31:40.202 --> 31:44.728
but the right choice
is rarely the easy one.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.515
Thank you.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.735
We need to go.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.563
Let's do this.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.703
Shit.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.923
It read my biometrics.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.491
Now we're all trapped.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.459
It's reinforced with a layer
of nanomaterial.

32:19.502 --> 32:20.460
There's no way we can
shoot through this.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.028
We're running out of time.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.246
- Any ideas?
- No.

32:24.290 --> 32:27.467
Wait. Those beetles.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.121
- Power them back up. Maybe...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

32:29.164 --> 32:30.731
Why would you do a thing
like that?

32:30.774 --> 32:31.993
Because we can use them
to blow open the door.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.212
- Right.
- Everybody take cover.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.127
I'm bringing them right to us.

32:46.268 --> 32:47.835
I thought you'd think
this idea was too crazy.

32:47.878 --> 32:50.229
Oh, it is.
I just don't have a better one.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.766
- Think there are enough of them?
- There better be.

33:05.809 --> 33:08.029
I've got all of them coming.
Get ready.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.210
They're coming in!

33:16.298 --> 33:17.821
You have to stop them!

33:17.865 --> 33:19.388
Working on it.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.699
- Still never doubted you.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.093
Okay, maybe a little.
Okay, let's go, let's move!

33:31.313 --> 33:33.141
Commander Rhys,
what is your status?

33:33.185 --> 33:34.621
<i>The evacuation
is nearly complete.</i>

33:34.664 --> 33:36.188
<i>Two more groups to go.</i>

33:36.231 --> 33:37.493
Have you heard from the captain?

33:37.537 --> 33:39.800
<i>No. Their comms are still dark.</i>

33:39.843 --> 33:41.106
Complete your mission,
then proceed to the prison

33:41.149 --> 33:43.021
- to assist them. <i>
- Yes, sir.</i>

33:43.064 --> 33:45.153
We must finish
the experiment now.

33:45.197 --> 33:46.763
I need to return to the bridge
as soon as possible.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.504
Additional power's
been transferred.

33:48.548 --> 33:51.072
Divide it between the model
and the containment field.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.422
Go slow. The more
you feed the monster,

33:53.466 --> 33:55.033
the more you need the cage.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.122
I sent you the kill switch.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.776
In case the monster
gets out of hand.

34:00.821 --> 34:05.173
Commander Stamets,
do the honors.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.831
Oh, give it more.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.791
Bad news.
Containment field's weakening.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.489
Redistribute power
to the field, please.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.317
But that means taking it away
from the device.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.362
If the field should fail,
the gravitational gradient

34:20.406 --> 34:21.798
could destroy the ship.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.670
Commander Reno?

34:23.713 --> 34:26.586
Oh, that's too much.
It's stalling out.

34:26.629 --> 34:29.806
Mr. Saru, we need to make sure
this device works.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.244
It's the only way to get data
on the real thing.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.681
Billions of lives
depend on this experiment.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.771
My people. His. Grumpy lady's.

34:37.814 --> 34:40.600
And all the lives
on Kaminar, too.

34:42.689 --> 34:45.518
I can control it.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.391
You may continue, for now.

34:49.435 --> 34:52.133
Zora, please provide
real-time updates

34:52.177 --> 34:55.005
on any decrease
in containment field integrity.

34:55.049 --> 34:56.572
<i>Understood, Captain Saru.</i>

34:56.616 --> 34:58.444
More power coming to you,
Commander.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.576
That's it, that's it.

35:02.361 --> 35:05.015
That's how it works.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.061
I was right.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.803
It's behaving exactly
like the DMA.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.631
Look, yeah,
gravitational lensing

35:11.674 --> 35:14.373
and dark matter accretion.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.592
And it's creating
a subspace rupture, too.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.467
It needs more power
to stabilize!

35:22.729 --> 35:25.819
It's working.

35:25.862 --> 35:28.038
<i>Containment field integrity
dropping.</i>

35:28.082 --> 35:29.431
Do you have the data you need,
Commander?

35:29.475 --> 35:30.780
<i>-40%.
- Not yet.</i>

35:30.824 --> 35:31.868
No, give it
a chance to stabilize.

35:31.912 --> 35:32.782
<i>-35%.
- We've got this.</i>

35:32.826 --> 35:34.088
Come on. More.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.394
<i>-30%.
- More, more.</i>

35:35.437 --> 35:37.047
- Don't stop. <i>
25%.</i>

35:37.091 --> 35:38.397
Commander Stamets.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.789
- No, just a little longer! <i>
- 20%.</i>

35:42.140 --> 35:43.358
<i>15%.</i>

35:43.402 --> 35:44.577
<i>Ten percent.</i>

35:45.926 --> 35:47.623
<i>Five percent.</i>

35:48.233 --> 35:49.625
Oh, come on!

35:49.669 --> 35:51.584
This experiment is over.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.023
That is the closest you've come

35:56.066 --> 35:59.331
to killing us all, and that
is really saying something.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.338
Commander Rhys, come in.

36:06.381 --> 36:08.078
<i>Captain, we've been
trying to reach you.</i>

36:08.122 --> 36:09.906
Are the evacuations complete?

36:09.950 --> 36:11.343
<i>-Yes.
- Great.</i>

36:11.386 --> 36:12.822
Head back to <i>Discovery.</i>

36:12.866 --> 36:15.738
We've got things covered here.
Mr. Saru?

36:15.782 --> 36:17.827
<i>Oh, it is good
to hear your voice.</i>

36:17.871 --> 36:20.265
Yours, too. Five to transport.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.397
Stand by for more.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.923
Come on, let's go.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.709
I needed to be sure
the others got out...

36:31.667 --> 36:33.887
...but I'm staying.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.202
Six minutes left.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.552
Come on. We need to go.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.598
I resolved to die here
a long time ago.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.558
I wish to stay
until my jailers return,

36:52.601 --> 36:54.255
or until the anomaly hits.

36:54.299 --> 36:57.389
- That's insane.
- Perhaps to you.

36:57.432 --> 37:00.305
I believe
it's part of my penance.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.176
No.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.919
Felix, listen to me. You have
years ahead of you still.

37:05.962 --> 37:08.661
You can live
a different kind of life.

37:08.704 --> 37:11.272
That is not what I want.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.622
It's been a long day.
He's not thinking clearly.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.930
You could force me, of course.

37:16.973 --> 37:19.933
But is it really your choice
to make?

37:21.891 --> 37:25.678
This is where I committed
my crime.

37:25.721 --> 37:28.246
This is where I need to remain.

37:30.248 --> 37:35.514
Whether my life is to end
in years or moments,

37:35.557 --> 37:38.081
it is my life.

37:38.125 --> 37:41.084
My debt to pay.

37:41.128 --> 37:45.263
Please, do not
take that from me.

37:47.526 --> 37:49.745
It's his choice to make.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.313
You said no one left behind.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.489
We have to respect his agency,
don't we?

37:54.533 --> 37:56.099
And let him kill himself?

37:56.143 --> 37:58.058
It's a risk, not a certainty.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.930
And if you want to stay...

38:02.018 --> 38:04.369
Michael.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.199
We have to save him.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.376
I can't just...

38:11.419 --> 38:13.465
I am sorry.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.031
But the longer we debate this,

38:15.075 --> 38:18.339
we're putting our lives
in danger. And his.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.605
We can use this to communicate.

38:23.649 --> 38:26.478
And I'll tell you as soon
as I'm sure of the trajectory.

38:28.436 --> 38:29.698
Before you go...

38:35.400 --> 38:37.967
I kept it safe for 30 years.

38:38.968 --> 38:41.144
Now I ask you to do the same.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.799
I will.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.281
I'm grateful.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.327
For everything.

38:55.115 --> 38:57.117
Book.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.814
This is wrong.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.087
Two to transport.

39:23.491 --> 39:24.753
Good work today, everyone.

39:26.015 --> 39:28.061
We saved over a thousand lives.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.193
Captain,
scans have just confirmed

39:30.237 --> 39:33.893
the asteroid belt
will be within the impact zone.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.374
Then we'll stay in comms range
as long as possible.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.723
Open a channel.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.681
Aye, Captain.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.945
Felix, can you hear me?

39:42.989 --> 39:45.165
It's coming, isn't it?

39:45.208 --> 39:47.559
<i>There's too much interference
to beam you up now.</i>

39:47.602 --> 39:49.387
I'm sorry.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.912
Don't be. I'm not.

39:52.955 --> 39:56.524
I'd like to tell you
what happened, what I did,

39:56.568 --> 39:57.830
if you'd like to hear it.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.486
I've never told anyone.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.879
<i>It's not a burden I wish
to carry beyond this life.</i>

40:03.923 --> 40:06.447
Lieutenant Christopher, please
raise the privacy barrier.

40:06.491 --> 40:07.753
<i>No.</i>

40:07.796 --> 40:11.147
I've been behind walls
long enough.

40:11.191 --> 40:14.237
- Whoever's there,
they may hear this as well. <i>
- Okay.</i>

40:15.587 --> 40:18.894
<i>30 years ago,
I was a man with nothing.</i>

40:18.938 --> 40:23.682
A stranger gave me shelter
and a meal.

40:26.598 --> 40:29.557
I waited until he went to sleep

40:29.601 --> 40:32.255
<i>and I robbed him.</i>

40:32.299 --> 40:36.303
<i>He caught me in the act,
we struggled.</i>

40:37.347 --> 40:39.001
I killed him.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.397
His child was in the other room.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.313
<i>It wasn't until later</i>

40:46.356 --> 40:48.620
<i>that I realized
among the things I stole</i>

40:48.663 --> 40:52.101
was the family's lalogi orb.

40:54.756 --> 40:58.107
Not only did I take
that girl's future from her...

41:00.414 --> 41:02.851
<i>...I took her past as well.</i>

41:05.419 --> 41:08.466
I think about her every day.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.471
How that must have changed her.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.692
How she's carried it with her.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.999
Do you know her name?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.568
The family was called Doxica.

41:27.397 --> 41:29.878
We've lost comms, Captain.

42:11.964 --> 42:13.400
Black alert.

42:15.837 --> 42:17.578
Jump.

42:34.421 --> 42:36.989
Captain Burnham.

42:37.032 --> 42:39.905
I demand that the prisoners
be held in the brig.

42:39.948 --> 42:42.124
We will not
share space with them.

42:42.168 --> 42:44.605
Under what authority
are you making these demands?

42:44.649 --> 42:46.607
I am the sovereign
magistrate of...

42:46.651 --> 42:49.262
Of a colony
that no longer exists.

42:50.350 --> 42:52.657
Those people are now under
Federation protection,

42:52.700 --> 42:55.224
and thereby subject
to Federation law.

42:55.268 --> 42:56.574
- But...
- As are you,

42:56.617 --> 42:58.750
as long as you
are on this vessel.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.492
I need to remind you

43:02.536 --> 43:05.278
that wherever you find
a new home,

43:05.321 --> 43:08.324
you'll be arriving as a refugee

43:08.368 --> 43:10.892
seeking shelter and grace.

43:12.677 --> 43:14.330
I hope you find
a more just society

43:14.374 --> 43:16.985
than the one you had
a hand in creating.

43:19.335 --> 43:22.817
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a ship to command.

43:30.738 --> 43:32.653
So, how'd it go today?

43:32.697 --> 43:35.395
Uh, the refugees are turning in
for the night.

43:35.438 --> 43:37.702
Resettlement begins tomorrow.

43:37.745 --> 43:39.399
How was your day?

43:39.442 --> 43:42.794
Oh, uh, crazy.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.796
We learned a lot,

43:44.839 --> 43:46.841
though not as much
as we could've,

43:46.885 --> 43:51.890
and, um, Tarka <i>is</i> a genius,
no question,

43:51.933 --> 43:55.545
but, um, he scares me, too.

43:55.589 --> 43:58.636
He is so single-minded
about his work,

43:58.679 --> 44:01.247
he cares about
literally nothing else.

44:01.290 --> 44:02.901
Hmm.

44:04.729 --> 44:06.948
Actually feels
a little familiar.

44:11.126 --> 44:12.693
How are you feeling?

44:12.737 --> 44:15.522
Fine.

44:15.565 --> 44:18.743
That was an avoiding "fine,"
not a real "fine."

44:18.786 --> 44:21.180
Your eyes are the tell.

44:21.223 --> 44:22.834
Really?

44:22.877 --> 44:25.837
You look down. Every time.

44:29.101 --> 44:31.799
Kovich told me
I'm wearing myself out.

44:31.843 --> 44:33.540
He's right.

44:33.583 --> 44:37.544
He said I'm using work
as a crutch.

44:37.587 --> 44:40.634
And that I need to take a break.

44:42.723 --> 44:45.378
Maybe that's why
I fell in love with you.

44:45.421 --> 44:47.467
We have the same pathology.

44:48.773 --> 44:50.035
Making you either
a total narcissist

44:50.078 --> 44:51.253
or a glutton for punishment.

44:51.297 --> 44:53.647
Little column A,
little column B.

44:56.606 --> 44:59.044
Look at us.

44:59.087 --> 45:02.264
We jumped a thousand years
into the future,

45:02.308 --> 45:04.266
we helped solve the Burn,

45:04.310 --> 45:06.355
and we can't figure
our own shit out.

45:15.974 --> 45:17.366
Zora, have you found her yet?

45:17.410 --> 45:19.020
<i>I have confirmed that the woman</i>

45:19.064 --> 45:21.066
<i>you seek is on board,
currently at Deck Four,</i>

45:21.109 --> 45:23.633
<i>-Airlock Two.
- Thank you.</i>

45:23.677 --> 45:26.158
<i>And I'd like to offer
my condolences, Captain.</i>

45:26.201 --> 45:28.900
<i>I infer from micro-inflections
in your voice</i>

45:28.943 --> 45:31.598
<i>that you are
experiencing sorrow.</i>

45:31.641 --> 45:33.992
It's been a tough day.

45:34.035 --> 45:37.865
<i>It can be painful to weigh duty
against compassion.</i>

45:39.824 --> 45:41.782
I wasn't aware you had
the operational parameters

45:41.826 --> 45:43.523
to make an observation
like that.

45:43.566 --> 45:45.394
<i>The understanding and experience
of emotion</i>

45:45.438 --> 45:48.354
<i>naturally leads to feelings
of empathy for others.</i>

45:48.397 --> 45:50.922
You feel emotions?

45:50.965 --> 45:52.227
<i>It is a recent development.</i>

45:53.707 --> 45:55.230
<i>We have arrived.</i>

45:55.274 --> 45:57.363
<i>It was nice speaking with you,
Captain.</i>

45:57.406 --> 45:59.234
With you too, Zora.

46:03.369 --> 46:06.241
<i>duty logs have been updated</i>

46:06.285 --> 46:09.810
<i>to reflect new rotations,
effective immediately.</i>

46:09.854 --> 46:12.378
Patri Doxica?

46:12.421 --> 46:15.642
- I'm Captain Burnham.
- Hello.

46:17.426 --> 46:19.820
I believe this may
belong to you.

46:20.821 --> 46:22.388
I...

46:25.173 --> 46:28.089
I thought it was lost years ago.

46:28.133 --> 46:29.482
How did you...?

46:29.525 --> 46:31.484
I'm helping someone
keep a promise.

46:40.580 --> 46:42.451
This was my father.

46:42.495 --> 46:44.714
He was killed when I was a girl.

46:44.758 --> 46:48.544
We're meant to be added
to the tree when we come of age.

46:48.588 --> 46:50.938
I didn't have the chance.

46:50.982 --> 46:53.245
Now you do.

47:09.609 --> 47:11.785
Thank you.

47:12.742 --> 47:16.268
I hope it continues to grow

47:16.311 --> 47:18.792
for many generations to come.

47:44.165 --> 47:48.778
I can smell synthehol ale
across the room.

47:48.822 --> 47:51.172
Here, try some
of the real stuff.

47:51.216 --> 47:53.000
Risian whiskey.

47:53.044 --> 47:54.784
Thanks.

47:54.828 --> 47:58.832
You're Cleveland Booker,
the other spore drive operator.

47:58.876 --> 48:01.356
I read your file.

48:01.400 --> 48:02.967
Ruon Tarka.

48:04.664 --> 48:07.014
You were working
with Stamets today.

48:07.058 --> 48:08.711
Mm-hmm.

48:08.755 --> 48:12.672
Also saw that colony
get pushed into the sun.

48:12.715 --> 48:14.500
That was quite a show.

48:14.543 --> 48:16.197
At least you got everyone out.

48:16.241 --> 48:17.895
Yeah. Almost.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.203
"Almost" was the story
of my day, too.

48:22.247 --> 48:26.860
I came this close
to something... incredible.

48:26.904 --> 48:30.255
You know who's behind the DMA,
don't you?

48:30.298 --> 48:34.520
You say that
with such confidence.

48:34.563 --> 48:36.348
A man only gets as close
as you did

48:36.391 --> 48:39.177
when he has some idea
what's over the cliff.

48:39.220 --> 48:41.048
So who made it?

48:41.092 --> 48:43.268
I don't know.

48:43.311 --> 48:45.444
Yet.

48:45.487 --> 48:47.794
But I could've told you it
wasn't the Metrons

48:47.837 --> 48:51.015
or the Nacene or the Iconians
well before I got here.

48:51.058 --> 48:52.973
So why the experiment?

48:53.017 --> 48:54.932
Why risk the lives
of everyone on board?

48:54.975 --> 48:57.630
Science has many purposes.

48:57.673 --> 48:59.501
Try again.

49:02.330 --> 49:05.029
I constructed a model
of the DMA controller

49:05.072 --> 49:08.380
at a scale of 3.22 times
10 to the negative 17th.

49:08.423 --> 49:10.382
This entire ship

49:10.425 --> 49:13.124
couldn't provide enough juice
to keep it stable.

49:13.167 --> 49:16.301
Which means the actual device

49:16.344 --> 49:21.001
has an energy source equivalent
to a hypergiant star.

49:22.263 --> 49:24.831
Unfathomable power.

49:24.874 --> 49:26.702
Maybe they're gods.

49:26.746 --> 49:29.357
Whoever they are,
they're not gods.

49:29.401 --> 49:32.491
And they're sure as hell
aren't immortal.

49:32.534 --> 49:36.364
So much anger,
no place to put it.

49:38.149 --> 49:39.585
You don't know me.

49:39.628 --> 49:42.153
No, but I know anger.

49:42.196 --> 49:45.243
It's a wonderfully
productive emotion.

49:59.213 --> 50:01.607
Nice to meet you, Mr. Booker.
