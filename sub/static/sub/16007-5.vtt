WEBVTT

00:04.481 --> 00:07.468
Keisha, it's Richard.
Is everything alright?

00:07.469 --> 00:09.464
I think I had a panic attack.

00:09.465 --> 00:11.436
Have you had them before?

00:11.437 --> 00:13.488
No. What, do you think
it'll happen again?

00:13.489 --> 00:16.516
Your Honour, Mr Dolan waived
parental responsibility at the time.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.456
In regards to a child.
We're talking about an embryo.

00:19.457 --> 00:20.500
It's my genetic material.

00:20.501 --> 00:22.972
It's my right to decide
what happens to it.

00:22.973 --> 00:25.964
I believe you are all
in the wrong jurisdiction.

00:25.965 --> 00:28.468
This is a probate issue.

00:28.469 --> 00:30.444
So Todd was your mate.

00:30.445 --> 00:32.444
Yeah, he was.

00:32.445 --> 00:33.496
Why would someone want to kill him?

00:33.497 --> 00:37.027
He tried to rip off the wrong
person. They've come after him.

00:37.052 --> 00:39.428
We still have Felix Murphy, yes?
Correct.

00:39.429 --> 00:41.496
He was shot in broad daylight,
at point-blank range.Yes.

00:41.497 --> 00:43.452
So he saw who shot him.

00:43.453 --> 00:45.472
He claims he never saw anything,
but he must have.

00:45.473 --> 00:47.428
He knows exactly who shot him.

00:47.429 --> 00:50.194
I want to organise
another undercover operation,

00:50.219 --> 00:52.484
but this time, we'll use a woman.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.480
How long ago did you leave him?

00:54.481 --> 00:58.437
Oh, like six months ago.

00:59.441 --> 01:03.476
Hey, that file that Simon deleted
from his computer?

01:03.477 --> 01:05.483
It's a gun.

01:05.485 --> 01:08.428
OK, there's a container
arriving at the docks tonight.

01:08.429 --> 01:10.492
Imported by Simon Hamilton.
Arriving?

01:10.493 --> 01:12.448
The bill of lading says fridges.

01:12.449 --> 01:14.332
I'll believe that when I see it.

01:16.501 --> 01:19.433
(Two-way radio crackles faintly)

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.473 --> 02:00.424
It'll take at least a day
to remove all the firing pins.

02:00.425 --> 02:02.484
Then we've got to repack everything
just the way it was.

02:02.485 --> 02:05.015
Then we can
tell the cargo terminal operator

02:05.040 --> 02:08.467
to notify Simon it's cleared customs
and ready for pick-up.

02:08.469 --> 02:10.477
Does the delay need to be explained?

02:10.477 --> 02:13.488
I don't think so. I mean,
it's not that unusual, is it?

02:13.489 --> 02:15.512
Nah. Some ships carry
hundreds of containers.

02:15.513 --> 02:17.468
Can take a week to get 'em all off.

02:17.469 --> 02:19.504
Hey, I just had a close look
at this bill of lading.

02:19.505 --> 02:21.623
See this contact number
written here?

02:21.648 --> 02:23.444
Simon's mobile.

02:23.445 --> 02:26.453
Except it's not Simon's.
It's Amil Nobakht's.

02:29.445 --> 02:31.496
Are you sure that's Amil's number?
Yeah, it's on his file.

02:31.497 --> 02:33.512
I remember those sort of details.
Phone numbers?

02:33.513 --> 02:35.484
Is that really so unusual?

02:35.485 --> 02:38.444
You need to get out more.
Yeah, I was trying to.

02:38.445 --> 02:39.516
So who's really behind this?

02:39.517 --> 02:43.432
Just Todd and Amil together
or Simon and the Nobakht family?

02:43.433 --> 02:45.508
I guess we'll find out
when someone comes to collect it.

02:45.509 --> 02:48.484
Alright, you stay here.
You're in charge, Richard.

02:48.485 --> 02:51.473
Text me when it's done.

03:01.469 --> 03:04.448
I checked that mobile number
on the bill of lading.

03:04.449 --> 03:06.440
You doubted Richard's memory?

03:06.441 --> 03:09.448
Well, it was worth a check. He has
made the occasional factual error.

03:09.449 --> 03:12.476
When? Anyway, this time
he does happen to be right.

03:12.477 --> 03:15.424
Lina, go back
over Karen Parker's interview.

03:15.425 --> 03:16.472
Check if there's any suggestion

03:16.473 --> 03:18.500
Simon Hamilton knew the Nobakhts.
I'll have a look.

03:18.501 --> 03:20.516
I bet it was Todd
using Simon's identity again.

03:20.517 --> 03:22.468
This is him and Amil, this import.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.504
It's a pretty tough import
to arrange from Australia.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.800
How much do the guns cost?
In America, about $1,000 each.

03:27.825 --> 03:29.500
Over here, maybe $15,000.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.468
So they spent half a million dollars

03:31.469 --> 03:33.484
buying weapons
and organising an importation.

03:33.485 --> 03:36.432
It's pretty unlikely
anyone can do that over the phone.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.472
You have to be working
with people you've met, trust.

03:38.473 --> 03:40.468
Well, I'll see who's been to America
lately.

03:40.469 --> 03:43.476
Check the entire Nobakht family
and Simon Hamilton, just in case.

03:43.477 --> 03:46.488
Janet! We just got an email
from Macquarie Street.

03:46.489 --> 03:49.784
Our illustrious Attorney-General
wants to see you and me.

03:49.809 --> 03:51.986
What about?
Urgent matter of business.

03:52.513 --> 03:55.500
Let me guess. His slice off the tee?

03:55.501 --> 03:57.796
His bad short game?
Something like that.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.476
Flat white?
Thanks.

03:59.477 --> 04:01.437
No, thanks, I'm good.

04:04.441 --> 04:06.456
A little something for you.

04:06.457 --> 04:10.464
The night before last,
third item on the news.

04:10.465 --> 04:14.424
This is the face of crime
out of control.

04:14.425 --> 04:18.468
Jane Carter is now only
being kept alive by life support.

04:18.469 --> 04:22.476
Her devastated husband Robbie
hasn't left her side.

04:22.477 --> 04:26.452
Her car was hit by convicted
drug dealer George Healy

04:26.453 --> 04:30.460
three minutes after the horrific
shooting of Todd Wilson.

04:30.461 --> 04:33.452
And George has himself
since been murdered

04:33.453 --> 04:35.492
and Todd's in-laws fired at.

04:35.493 --> 04:41.468
So far, to explain all this,
$3.5 million has been spent

04:41.469 --> 04:45.488
on a royal commission whose hearings
have mostly been held in private

04:45.489 --> 04:48.508
and whose progress
has been revealed to no-one,

04:48.509 --> 04:51.468
if there has been any progress
at all.

04:51.469 --> 04:53.822
Is the Attorney-General
going to comment?

04:55.425 --> 04:58.460
The Opposition grilled us
all afternoon.

04:58.461 --> 05:02.500
We pleaded operational
confidentiality all afternoon

05:02.501 --> 05:04.516
because we had nothing.

05:04.517 --> 05:07.512
Before Parliament resumes
I need an interim report

05:07.513 --> 05:10.440
with some preliminary findings.

05:10.441 --> 05:12.468
We're not ready.
Being ready doesn't matter, Janet.

05:12.469 --> 05:14.500
With all due respect,
I don't think you understand...

05:14.501 --> 05:16.516
Obviously some parts of it
can be suppressed

05:16.517 --> 05:18.576
or for non-publication or whatever.

05:18.601 --> 05:21.484
But I need to demonstrate
material progress.

05:21.485 --> 05:23.512
Once we make material progress,
I'll write a report.

05:23.513 --> 05:25.499
Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.505
You're not here to debate the merits
of an interim report.

05:28.505 --> 05:30.500
I am telling you to write one.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.500
Before Parliament resumes.

05:32.501 --> 05:34.468
I can't write an accurate report

05:34.469 --> 05:36.476
until we know exactly
who's bringing in these...

05:36.477 --> 05:40.496
Did I say accurate? I said a report.
That's three syllables.

05:40.497 --> 05:43.481
Which one of them
is not getting through?

05:46.509 --> 05:48.686
Well, if she won't write it,
you will.

05:48.711 --> 05:50.440
Understood?

05:50.441 --> 05:53.432
I can draft one, but it can only
be delivered under her signature.

05:53.433 --> 05:56.468
Just highlight whatever pebbles
of truth you've managed to...

05:56.469 --> 05:58.496
I'm still in the room here.
...kick down the street.

05:58.497 --> 06:02.484
The most likely scenarios
are disputes over drug buys

06:02.485 --> 06:05.460
and we heavily suspect that
the current coke and ice epidemics

06:05.461 --> 06:08.444
underpin all major gun crime,
et cetera, et cetera.

06:08.445 --> 06:10.445
Needs a firm hand, et cetera.
Sure.

06:10.446 --> 06:12.509
Don't be ridiculous! You can
change it in the final report

06:12.510 --> 06:16.476
if by some fluke, you ever manage
to make any real headway.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.496
No!
I don't want lies.

06:18.497 --> 06:21.457
I want informed and educated
speculation...

06:21.457 --> 06:23.472
OK. Alright.
..from disparate incomplete sources.

06:23.473 --> 06:26.464
Fortunately you work for me
and we do not respond to threats.

06:26.465 --> 06:29.877
Nor do I make them. I merely explain
what I need to happen!

06:29.902 --> 06:33.500
I am not required to solve
your political problems, Attorney.

06:33.501 --> 06:36.456
We have gathered a considerable
amount of intelligence

06:36.457 --> 06:39.436
and we are on the cusp
of understanding the whole picture.

06:39.437 --> 06:43.261
If we all just take a step back...
And I will not risk all of that

06:43.286 --> 06:46.318
to stop and write
some half-baked piece of fiction.

06:46.461 --> 06:52.453
If you hang me out to dry next week
in Parliament, I will destroy you.

06:57.505 --> 07:00.460
Bloody arrogant fool.
Don't make him an enemy.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.468
He's already an enemy.
Learn how to bend.

07:02.469 --> 07:05.456
I won't give him the ammunition
to say I'm incompetent.

07:05.457 --> 07:08.484
That's not what he wants.
We both know this report's nonsense.

07:08.485 --> 07:10.484
And so down the track,
if he ever wanted to...

07:10.485 --> 07:13.424
He's not thinking that far ahead.
Well, I am.

07:13.425 --> 07:15.464
You know
and if we write this piece of crap

07:15.465 --> 07:18.464
to momentarily
help shore up his approval rating,

07:18.465 --> 07:23.424
that piece of crap, signed by me,
will be on the public record forever.

07:23.425 --> 07:25.425
(Phone chimes)

07:26.433 --> 07:28.428
Hey.
JANET: Progress?

07:28.429 --> 07:29.512
Ah, maybe halfway?

07:29.513 --> 07:31.480
There's over 500 weapons here

07:31.481 --> 07:33.516
and missing just one
could be disastrous, so...

07:33.517 --> 07:35.516
They can't rush.
Yeah, I know.

07:35.517 --> 07:38.484
But to make an arrest,
whoever owns these guns

07:38.485 --> 07:41.485
has to take possession
of the container and open it.

07:41.510 --> 07:45.424
That's our payday, so the sooner
you're ready, the better.

07:45.425 --> 07:47.460
Janet, you want to have a look?
Yes.

07:47.461 --> 07:50.472
Federal Police printed it
from Simon Hamilton's computer.

07:50.473 --> 07:52.439
Not the easiest thing
to put together.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.440
You have to assemble it, add a
firing pin and buy your own bullets.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.433
But if you want it to work
you do need

07:57.433 --> 07:58.504
some expertise in how guns are made.

07:58.505 --> 08:01.682
Which I'm assuming
Major Hamilton's got, being a major.

08:01.707 --> 08:05.428
Nothing on America. Todd and Amil
have never been nor Bahman.

08:05.429 --> 08:07.516
Susie and Karen went to Disneyland
when they were ten and eight

08:07.517 --> 08:11.444
and Simon Hamilton's last trip
to America was seven years ago.

08:11.445 --> 08:13.464
Hamilton would have met Americans
in Afghanistan.

08:13.465 --> 08:15.444
A soldier
moonlighting in the gun trade?

08:15.445 --> 08:16.512
I can sweep through his contacts
again,

08:16.513 --> 08:18.504
look into any residing in the US.

08:18.505 --> 08:20.505
Thanks. When are you testing this?

08:20.530 --> 08:23.432
Tonight hopefully.
Till when?

08:23.433 --> 08:25.485
Ah, late, probably. Sorry.

08:30.489 --> 08:32.842
Hang with me
if you want some excitement.

08:32.866 --> 08:35.432
Big fight in council
over netball courts.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.456
Ah, it was a truly vicious
non-contact sport

08:37.457 --> 08:38.515
the way we played it at high school.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.988
Only matched in aggression
by local council

08:41.013 --> 08:43.488
development approval meetings -
come see.

08:43.489 --> 08:48.432
(Calling tone)

08:48.433 --> 08:50.444
(Computer bleeps)

08:50.445 --> 08:53.516
Hello.
Hi.

08:53.517 --> 08:55.468
They're asleep.

08:55.469 --> 08:58.448
What can I say?
I'm not going to wake them.

08:58.449 --> 09:00.444
No, um... No, don't do that.

09:00.445 --> 09:02.740
I'll... I'll try again
tomorrow morning.

09:02.765 --> 09:04.448
How you going, dear?

09:04.449 --> 09:05.516
Ah, good. Yeah.

09:05.517 --> 09:07.468
Make sure you eat well.

09:07.469 --> 09:10.424
And watch your water intake.
Sure, Mum.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.424
I know you love your work,
but you've got to get a balance.

09:13.425 --> 09:15.484
And settle that thing with Deborah.

09:15.485 --> 09:16.544
Well, it's not that easy, actually...

09:16.545 --> 09:19.440
Listen to me. You don't need it.

09:19.441 --> 09:21.500
Gotta go. Doctor Blake.

09:21.501 --> 09:23.468
Talk tomorrow.

09:23.469 --> 09:25.488
Enjoy.
Bye.

09:25.489 --> 09:27.489
(Computer bleeps)

09:33.457 --> 09:35.424
Have you written anything?

09:35.425 --> 09:37.424
I've started a draft,
if you want to see...

09:37.425 --> 09:41.308
When we let the container run
and arrest whoever claims it, then...

09:41.333 --> 09:45.098
then I'll write something 'cause
we will have made real progress.

09:45.465 --> 09:47.484
Bianca and Felix?
Yeah, they went well, apparently.

09:47.485 --> 09:50.448
Despite the close call,
they're on again tonight.

09:50.449 --> 09:52.488
Right. And Andy's...

09:52.489 --> 09:54.501
He's running it, yes.

09:58.425 --> 10:01.131
Anyway, I can't bear
just sitting here waiting.

10:01.156 --> 10:03.509
If anything happens,
you'll hear from me.

10:28.473 --> 10:31.440
Hi. Has she started?

10:31.441 --> 10:33.030
Ah, just about to meet him.

10:33.055 --> 10:35.031
You want to stay?

10:35.461 --> 10:37.579
Let me know if there's a problem.
OK.

10:37.604 --> 10:38.664
Thanks.

11:01.489 --> 11:05.436
Hey.
Oh, hey. How you going?

11:05.437 --> 11:08.436
Busy day?
Yeah. Yeah. You?

11:08.437 --> 11:10.504
It was sort of slow, actually.

11:10.505 --> 11:13.436
But maybe that's
just 'cause I was feeling...

11:13.437 --> 11:14.516
I couldn't wait for it to end.

11:14.517 --> 11:17.511
Oh, that's a bit sad if I'm the most
exciting thing in your life.

11:17.512 --> 11:20.441
Don't undersell yourself, handsome.
(Laughs) Yeah.

11:20.441 --> 11:22.559
Although modesty is attractive.
Yeah.

11:25.473 --> 11:28.477
Drink? What are you having?
Yeah, sure. Great. Um...

11:29.477 --> 11:31.456
Um... um...

11:31.457 --> 11:33.444
Ah, I don't feel like a beer
or anything.

11:33.445 --> 11:35.440
Maybe like a vodka tonic?
Yep.

11:35.441 --> 11:37.472
I'll just have a beer, thanks.

11:37.473 --> 11:39.432
No, I've got it.
Is that my drink?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.441
Oh, sorry, yeah. OK.

11:42.485 --> 11:44.476
I never noticed that before.

11:44.477 --> 11:46.484
Yeah. Long story.

11:46.485 --> 11:48.721
OK. OK, you can tell me later.
Alright.

11:49.513 --> 11:51.480
Here it is.
Jetsetter London.

11:51.481 --> 11:53.436
Five?
Yep.

11:53.437 --> 11:55.476
Watch out.
(Coin clatters)

11:55.477 --> 11:59.497
But now I'm gonna become an addict,
'cause gambling's fun.

12:05.445 --> 12:06.500
Again.

12:06.501 --> 12:08.501
(Laughs)

12:10.501 --> 12:12.473
Beginner's luck.

12:21.432 --> 12:25.432
MAN: It has potential to create
significant equity when well-planned.

12:25.433 --> 12:28.456
Mr Bao Long, we've heard enough
about tourism and revenue.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.428
What about the plan
to replace 26 netball courts?

12:31.429 --> 12:33.516
Well, the council has assured me
that they will find the land

12:33.517 --> 12:36.468
to build the new netball...
So there's no plan, is there?

12:36.469 --> 12:39.480
Will any of the money from
your 250 addictive poker machines

12:39.481 --> 12:42.508
go towards community sports for the
young girls of south-west Sydney?

12:42.509 --> 12:44.472
Yes, we're... we're building a pool.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.504
You're bulldozing their courts.
They'llget more.

12:46.505 --> 12:49.464
Will they?
Yes, if the council does their job.

12:49.465 --> 12:51.473
I'm buying the land
from the State Government...

12:51.474 --> 12:53.449
And how much are you paying?

12:53.449 --> 12:55.464
Well, until the contract
is actually finalised,

12:55.465 --> 12:57.468
that's between State Cabinet
and myself.

12:57.469 --> 13:00.432
They want $15 million.
You're offering 12. Isn't that it?

13:00.433 --> 13:02.440
I'm investing in resources
and infrastructure

13:02.441 --> 13:04.468
for the community
that gave me a start.

13:04.469 --> 13:06.508
You do exactly the same, Patrick,
unless you're outbid.

13:06.509 --> 13:08.516
OK, I don't create a mass
of gambling addicts

13:08.517 --> 13:10.488
to fund a personal edifice.

13:10.489 --> 13:12.725
Christ's sake.
It's a leisure centre...

13:12.750 --> 13:14.809
Bullshit, it's halfway to a casino!

13:22.481 --> 13:26.517
Now, if I could continue
my proposal, ladies and gentlemen.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.614
Thank you for a lovely evening.
Again.

13:33.639 --> 13:35.436
Glad you enjoyed it.

13:35.437 --> 13:37.441
You know,
if you ever meet my parents

13:37.441 --> 13:39.677
we might have to rewrite history
a bit.

13:39.702 --> 13:42.997
'Where did you two meet?'
'Oh, um, in the holding cells.'

13:44.449 --> 13:46.424
Wouldn't go down well?
Unlikely.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.440
Yeah.

13:48.441 --> 13:50.476
What do they think about your ex?

13:50.477 --> 13:53.456
Good job, steady income.
They think he's great.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.163
It was hard to tell them
about the other stuff.

13:56.188 --> 13:57.460
Yeah.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.579
How many people
knew about your knee?

14:00.477 --> 14:03.432
What... what about it?
What happened?

14:03.433 --> 14:05.464
I don't remember what happened.

14:05.465 --> 14:08.484
Oh, I see. Off-limits. I get it.

14:08.485 --> 14:11.662
No, it's not off-limits.
I just... just don't remember.

14:11.687 --> 14:15.647
OK. Well, this is me.

14:20.429 --> 14:22.429
What are you doing on the weekend?

14:22.454 --> 14:24.476
Um...

14:24.477 --> 14:26.493
Am I being pushy?

14:26.493 --> 14:29.428
No. No, no.
I'd... I'd love to do something.

14:29.429 --> 14:33.461
Um... Picnic maybe or a movie?
I don't mind.

14:45.461 --> 14:47.516
Text me?
I will.

14:47.517 --> 14:50.461
Promise?

15:01.469 --> 15:04.444
OK, see ya.
See you. Have a good night.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.453
You too. Bye.

15:15.513 --> 15:17.493
(Flashback of gunshot)

15:22.489 --> 15:25.425
(Breathes raggedly)

15:30.473 --> 15:34.465
(Sobs)

15:36.445 --> 15:39.429
(Dials)

15:40.429 --> 15:42.429
(Ringing tone)

15:44.429 --> 15:45.476
(Phone rings)

15:45.477 --> 15:47.476
(Sobs wordlessly)
Keisha.

15:47.477 --> 15:51.440
I... I don't know where to go!
You have to come get me!

15:51.441 --> 15:54.456
What... what happened?
Please, please, please!

15:54.457 --> 15:57.448
Please, Richard! Please!

15:57.449 --> 15:58.497
I'm at work.

16:02.425 --> 16:03.488
Keisha.

16:03.489 --> 16:05.476
(Softly) Fuck this.

16:05.477 --> 16:07.445
(Dials)

16:08.445 --> 16:09.517
(Ringing tone)

16:11.465 --> 16:13.465
Hey, it's Keisha. Leave a message.

16:17.437 --> 16:19.429
Did she say where she was?

16:19.429 --> 16:22.444
Ah, look, I know that her shift
finished about ten minutes ago,

16:22.445 --> 16:24.516
so she could be anywhere
between work and home.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.504
OK. Hey mate, have we still got
a feed on Keisha Gibson's house?

16:28.505 --> 16:31.424
Righto, here we go.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.508
Why is she still on surveillance?
She's not a suspect.

16:33.509 --> 16:37.627
Relax. We haven't looked at the feed
since she brought in Todd's money,

16:37.628 --> 16:40.631
and we wouldn't be now if you hadn't
called in asking to find Keisha.

16:40.632 --> 16:41.488
Yeah, I...

16:41.489 --> 16:43.469
OK, OK. I'm just...

16:44.469 --> 16:46.528
..checking to see if she's alright.

16:46.529 --> 16:48.588
Yep, all good. She's coming in now.

16:48.613 --> 16:50.492
Great, OK. Thank you, Owen.

16:50.493 --> 16:52.468
Hey, hang on, Richard.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.646
Think she might be getting some help
from someone else.

16:55.671 --> 16:57.452
It's that mate of Todd's,

16:57.453 --> 16:59.509
the one that was with him
when he broke into Boccarro's car.

16:59.509 --> 17:01.485
Brett Bonar?
Yeah, that's him.

17:02.505 --> 17:04.468
BRETT: You gonna be OK?

17:04.469 --> 17:06.587
KEISHA: Ah... I mean, it was just...

17:06.612 --> 17:08.568
It was just the lights.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.424
I don't know.
I don't know what's happening.

17:12.425 --> 17:14.500
It just suddenly feels like I'm...
I'm there again and...

17:14.501 --> 17:16.460
Sorry to break it to you, mate.

17:16.461 --> 17:18.448
Looks like you have
some competition there.

17:18.449 --> 17:21.391
Look, I was just making sure
that she was safe, OK?

17:21.415 --> 17:24.400
Yeah, sure. See you, mate.
Yeah, thank you.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.425
See you tomorrow!

18:09.513 --> 18:11.504
Oh, hi.
Hi! Come in.

18:11.505 --> 18:14.917
Oh, I can come back in the morning.
No, no, don't be silly.

18:14.942 --> 18:16.918
I'll just get changed.

18:18.461 --> 18:20.449
Ah...

18:21.457 --> 18:23.424
So how did it go?

18:23.425 --> 18:26.453
Good, I think.
Cautiously optimistic.

18:29.505 --> 18:33.468
So you don't think that
he's ever doubted you or...?

18:33.469 --> 18:37.444
No, no, he likes me.
I like him too, actually.

18:37.445 --> 18:41.480
I mean, not like...
but he's nice. A softy.

18:41.481 --> 18:43.500
So in that sense,

18:43.501 --> 18:46.484
it's an easy relationship
to work on.

18:46.485 --> 18:49.468
But in terms of the end game,

18:49.469 --> 18:53.440
getting him to talk about
the shooting... it's tough.

18:53.441 --> 18:55.513
Huge. Brick wall.

18:56.513 --> 18:58.572
So that'll take some breaking down.

19:01.485 --> 19:03.517
Well, if anyone can do that...

19:06.433 --> 19:09.022
Yeah, well, it must be
hard for him to trust,

19:09.047 --> 19:12.067
feeling he has enemies so close.

19:12.505 --> 19:14.623
Well, everyone has to trust someone.

19:16.501 --> 19:18.457
I have.

19:19.465 --> 19:21.469
Go insane otherwise.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.424
How are the kids?
Ah, not sure tonight.

19:33.425 --> 19:37.308
Tried a Skype call, but my darling
mother had put them to bed early

19:37.333 --> 19:40.281
so she could watch
her favourite TV show.

19:41.441 --> 19:44.089
I'm trying to imagine
what your mother's like.

19:45.513 --> 19:49.484
She's an irritatingly single-minded
control freak.

19:49.485 --> 19:52.464
I believe I said that
without a hint of irony.

19:52.465 --> 19:54.457
(Chuckles)

19:56.429 --> 19:58.444
She must worry about you.

19:58.445 --> 20:01.425
Ah, I'm sure she does
in her own way.

20:02.425 --> 20:05.955
At the moment, she thinks
I've got everything out of balance.

20:05.980 --> 20:07.628
I need to relax, apparently.

20:08.433 --> 20:10.440
Hence the workout?

20:10.441 --> 20:12.461
Yes, well, you do what you can.

20:14.517 --> 20:18.429
Cheers to that.
Cheers.

20:34.493 --> 20:37.437
(Sighs)

20:49.481 --> 20:53.460
Janet, interesting news
Andy got from police ballistics.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.516
When you fire the gun we printed,

20:54.517 --> 20:56.635
the barrel flies back off the stock.

20:56.660 --> 20:59.444
So you can only fire it once?
Apparently.

20:59.445 --> 21:01.916
And Todd Wilson was killed
with one bullet.

21:01.941 --> 21:05.436
Do you know of all the cases
I've run involving guns,

21:05.437 --> 21:09.428
I can't remember any other times
someone fired just one bullet.

21:09.429 --> 21:10.512
He was probably killed
with a homemade plastic gun.

21:10.513 --> 21:13.925
Yeah, it makes sense why the marks
on the bullet and casing

21:13.950 --> 21:16.942
don't match any normal firearm.
(Text message tone)

21:18.493 --> 21:20.469
It's Richard.

21:21.493 --> 21:23.448
Guns are ready.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.444
The terminal operator
will contact Amil when we tell them

21:26.445 --> 21:28.464
and he's almost certain
to call a trucking company

21:28.465 --> 21:30.432
to organise a pick-up and delivery.

21:30.433 --> 21:31.504
There's a bug in his phone, yeah?
Yep.

21:31.505 --> 21:34.741
As are Bahman, Sam, Susie
and Elaheh's and the landline.

21:34.766 --> 21:38.428
And LDs are inside the house
and smash repair shop.

21:38.429 --> 21:40.429
OK, the team's ready at the docks?

21:40.454 --> 21:42.454
We're all set.

21:45.441 --> 21:47.453
OK.

21:49.441 --> 21:50.468
(Ringing tone)

21:50.469 --> 21:52.500
(Phone rings)

21:52.501 --> 21:54.488
Yeah?

21:54.489 --> 21:57.444
We're on. Shut the container.
We'll make the call.

21:57.445 --> 21:58.489
OK.

22:32.513 --> 22:35.437
(Phone rings)

22:39.449 --> 22:40.452
Hello?

22:40.453 --> 22:42.496
I'm Dave Reynolds
from Sydney Cargo Terminal.

22:42.497 --> 22:45.444
Is that Simon Hamilton?
Ah, yes, speaking.

22:45.445 --> 22:50.448
This is a courtesy call to let
you know that container JL1349-76

22:50.449 --> 22:52.155
has been cleared for pick-up.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.472
OK, thanks.

22:53.473 --> 22:56.489
So Amil's happy to impersonate
Simon Hamilton.

23:00.429 --> 23:02.724
Ah, what do we have here?
Yum, yum, yum.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.484
WOMAN: Don't! Stop!

23:04.485 --> 23:07.424
Do we have any hummus left?

23:07.425 --> 23:09.190
There's another bowl, I think.

23:13.469 --> 23:15.436
Salaam.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.424
Brett - all good?

23:17.425 --> 23:18.492
Yeah, sorry I'm late.
Bahman outside?

23:18.493 --> 23:21.433
Yeah, he's just murdering some lamb.
Smells good.

23:22.433 --> 23:23.484
Any activity?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.456
Nothing yet.
Nothing?

23:25.457 --> 23:26.512
This is crazy.

23:26.513 --> 23:29.448
So what are they doing?
Do they know they're being watched?

23:29.449 --> 23:30.508
LINA: They can't know, can they?

23:30.509 --> 23:32.492
Haven't they at least
organised a pick-up?

23:32.493 --> 23:34.516
Nup.
They've organised a barbecue. Listen.

23:34.517 --> 23:36.496
AMIL: Yeah, you left us
early last night.

23:36.497 --> 23:39.456
BRETT: Yeah, mercy mission.
Keisha was having a freak-out.

23:39.457 --> 23:42.484
Had to pick her up, take her home.
Then what? Tuck her into bed, huh?

23:42.485 --> 23:44.508
No, man, it's not like that.
She's struggling.

23:44.509 --> 23:46.476
Did you know this about Keisha?

23:46.477 --> 23:49.301
BRETT: It's really got to her.
She's such a mess.

23:49.326 --> 23:51.448
Is she getting help?

23:51.449 --> 23:52.509
I told her she ought to see someone.

23:53.509 --> 23:56.436
Well, maybe she needs a little nudge.

23:56.437 --> 23:59.492
AMIL: Had she heard
anything more on Todd?

23:59.493 --> 24:01.452
No, you?

24:01.453 --> 24:04.336
Nothing. What that bastard's done
to our family...

24:04.361 --> 24:07.361
Just try not to do anything
too stupid, OK?

24:08.425 --> 24:09.484
What, that's it?

24:09.485 --> 24:13.464
No calls to anyone, no sense
of excitement or fear - nothing!

24:13.465 --> 24:15.472
Wow.
Have they been tipped off?

24:15.473 --> 24:17.432
You do have to wonder.

24:17.433 --> 24:19.488
I mean, there were dozens
of Customs guys and Feds around.

24:19.489 --> 24:21.444
It only takes one.

24:21.445 --> 24:22.492
If it was anyone in Customs,

24:22.493 --> 24:26.317
the State Corruption Commission
are the guys to ask - Roger Embry.

24:26.342 --> 24:28.370
Great.

24:29.457 --> 24:31.433
So what, now we just wait?

24:32.497 --> 24:34.453
Your call.

24:43.346 --> 24:45.464
Heather, great - I got you a meeting

24:45.465 --> 24:47.492
at the State Corruption Commission
with Roger Embry.

24:47.493 --> 24:50.483
We need to check the Customs guys
who helped with the container...

24:50.484 --> 24:53.661
..didn't tip off the Nobakhts.
Sorry. I can't be there.

24:53.686 --> 24:55.863
That's OK, I can handle it.
Thank you.

24:58.485 --> 25:01.440
Hey, would you like a flat white?

25:01.441 --> 25:04.472
Ah, where I'm heading
that'd be helpful.

25:04.473 --> 25:08.452
My tab must be enormous by now.
Let me pay you something.

25:08.453 --> 25:10.448
No, you're obviously late.
Fix me up later.

25:10.449 --> 25:13.424
Anyway, your muscle men buy
more than enough to keep me rich.

25:13.425 --> 25:14.496
Muscle men?
Your security.

25:14.497 --> 25:17.460
I thought it was overkill,
but I can see why you need them.

25:17.461 --> 25:19.579
Loads of people
check this place out.

25:19.604 --> 25:20.436
Really?
Yeah.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.476
A guy hung around on that seat
all morning yesterday.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.595
I thought he was gonna to hit on me,

25:24.620 --> 25:27.856
but as soon as you left, he went,
which was a bit weird.

25:34.437 --> 25:36.967
Anyway, I guess
it comes with the territory.

25:40.445 --> 25:42.465
Thanks.

25:43.489 --> 25:45.469
See ya.

25:56.461 --> 25:58.465
(Faint chatter)

25:59.465 --> 26:01.460
Who's here?

26:01.461 --> 26:03.579
We all are, except for Deborah's QC.

26:03.580 --> 26:06.698
She's on her own today -
must have got his first bill.

26:06.723 --> 26:08.460
You OK?

26:08.461 --> 26:10.464
What? Yes, of course - why?

26:10.465 --> 26:14.444
You look like you've seen a ghost.
No, I'm fine.

26:14.445 --> 26:16.508
Well, let's just stay calm
and rely on legal argument.

26:16.509 --> 26:18.464
Leave the emotion to Tim and Deb.

26:18.465 --> 26:20.424
Justice Stanton has four kids.

26:20.425 --> 26:22.468
Perhaps this once
the court will respond to emotion.

26:22.469 --> 26:25.472
She's not a mother, she's a judge
and judges are emotionless.

26:25.473 --> 26:27.444
Humourless and emotionless.

26:27.445 --> 26:29.432
OK.

26:29.433 --> 26:31.963
Then I showed the email to Brad,
my husband,

26:31.988 --> 26:34.464
and he couldn't stop smiling.

26:34.465 --> 26:38.464
Ah, so we... we rang Ash
and she repeated what she'd written

26:38.465 --> 26:44.456
and we were so excited and grateful,
because after all these years trying

26:44.457 --> 26:48.448
we actually felt hopeful we would
get the chance to be parents.

26:48.449 --> 26:51.436
On second thoughts, Mr Gillies,
I think I might start with you.

26:51.437 --> 26:53.440
What are the issues here?

26:53.441 --> 26:55.444
This isn't a criminal matter.
No, Your Honour.

26:55.445 --> 26:58.496
I assumed, as the Director of
the DPP, that it must be criminal,

26:58.497 --> 27:01.733
which would be a novelty for us
in the probate division.

27:01.758 --> 27:04.476
(Chuckles) Ah, yes.
Very amusing, Your Honour.

27:04.477 --> 27:07.493
No, Your Honour,
I'm on leave for a fortnight

27:07.493 --> 27:09.611
and appearing as amicus for Ms King.

27:09.636 --> 27:11.452
In your spare time?

27:11.453 --> 27:15.277
Mm, yes, Your Honour, this is how
I choose to spend my spare time.

27:15.302 --> 27:16.476
In court?

27:16.477 --> 27:18.468
Yes.
Extraordinary.

27:18.469 --> 27:20.456
Your Honour, this is about
my sister's wish

27:20.457 --> 27:22.472
for me to be given a last chance
to have a child.

27:22.473 --> 27:24.472
Yes, thank you...
I'm sorry.

27:24.473 --> 27:26.452
What about me?
It's my genetic material.

27:26.453 --> 27:28.440
I'm the only one
with a genuine interest...

27:28.441 --> 27:31.448
Your Honour, who paid for it,
and who supported Ash through...

27:31.449 --> 27:33.861
It's part of me.
She said I could have it.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.938
Yes, yes. Thank you.
You will all get a chance.

27:36.449 --> 27:38.472
Mr Gillies, why is this
in the probate court?

27:38.473 --> 27:41.121
If it concerns children
or potential children,

27:41.146 --> 27:43.440
shouldn't it be in the Family Court?

27:43.441 --> 27:46.912
Ms King is seeking a declaration
of her proprietary interest

27:46.913 --> 27:50.149
in an item that by agreement
with the entity storing it,

27:50.174 --> 27:54.480
belonged to her deceased de facto,
Ms Larsson, the applicant's sister.

27:54.481 --> 27:57.424
What is the property in dispute?

27:57.425 --> 27:59.437
A frozen embryo, Your Honour.

28:00.481 --> 28:02.437
Is that property?

28:03.445 --> 28:05.424
Ah, well... Ah... (Chuckles)

28:05.425 --> 28:07.073
..yes, that is the question.

28:07.098 --> 28:08.464
Ah, we believe it is.

28:08.465 --> 28:10.436
All we're asking
the court to discern

28:10.437 --> 28:12.504
is to whom the frozen embryo
belongs, not what happens to it.

28:12.505 --> 28:14.460
Once the ownership is determined,

28:14.461 --> 28:18.050
the party to whom it belongs
can decide its fate... or future.

28:18.501 --> 28:20.678
Do I have affidavits
from all parties?

28:20.703 --> 28:22.472
ALL: Yes.

28:22.473 --> 28:25.452
In that case, I'll take
a short adjournment to read them.

28:25.453 --> 28:28.500
Ah, if the court pleases,
Your Honour, may I observe

28:28.501 --> 28:31.678
that this matter has been through
several jurisdictions

28:31.703 --> 28:36.432
and costs are mounting and we would
all, I'm sure, welcome a resolution.

28:36.433 --> 28:38.484
I will review the material
and then we will reconvene.

28:38.485 --> 28:40.493
WOMAN: All rise.

28:51.465 --> 28:53.465
WOMAN: Hey, hi.

29:04.497 --> 29:06.492
She wants info from me?

29:06.493 --> 29:08.468
That's a turn-up.

29:08.469 --> 29:11.468
We thought we'd let a container run
from the cargo terminal,

29:11.469 --> 29:13.469
but no-one's coming to pick it up.

29:13.494 --> 29:15.452
They been tipped off?
Maybe.

29:15.453 --> 29:16.508
We're not sure, to be honest.

29:16.509 --> 29:19.493
But we know you put a blowtorch
through Customs last year,

29:19.494 --> 29:21.448
got rid of some bad apples,

29:21.449 --> 29:24.469
and we were wondering if you'd done
any other follow-up surveillance,

29:24.469 --> 29:27.516
or might know of any other people
in Customs who might be suss.

29:27.517 --> 29:30.517
So Janet doesn't think
we finished the job properly.

29:30.542 --> 29:32.456
Is that the implication?
No.

29:32.457 --> 29:35.476
Sounds like the implication.
Just ruling out possibilities.

29:35.477 --> 29:38.448
You haven't worked with her before,
have you?

29:38.449 --> 29:39.626
What's your opinion?

29:41.417 --> 29:43.476
Smart, fair. Pretty good, actually.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.480
Divides people, don't you think?

29:45.481 --> 29:48.464
When people are wrong, she'll
point that out and explain why.

29:48.465 --> 29:49.512
That's what divides people.

29:49.513 --> 29:51.690
You either have to admit
she was right

29:51.715 --> 29:54.699
or you resent her
for not letting you win.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.512
So basically, if she was a bloke,

29:59.513 --> 30:02.453
you'd all think
she was bloody fantastic.

30:03.485 --> 30:07.427
I'll tell her Customs are clean,
though, yeah? That was the message?

30:07.489 --> 30:09.473
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

30:21.517 --> 30:23.512
Here we are.

30:23.513 --> 30:25.469
Dr Orsmond's in there.

30:28.437 --> 30:30.508
So if you didn't make this
appointment, was it you, Lina?

30:30.509 --> 30:32.500
It was Janet.

30:32.501 --> 30:34.500
She said that Adie's really good
with trauma.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.468
She squeezed you in as a favour.

30:36.469 --> 30:38.464
So, what, you're here because...?

30:38.465 --> 30:41.496
Good question.
It's a business hours thing.

30:41.497 --> 30:44.512
Nights are OK,
but during work hours,

30:44.513 --> 30:48.396
the commission staff technically
shouldn't see anyone on their own,

30:48.421 --> 30:50.421
if we can help it.

30:53.461 --> 30:55.489
See ya.
See ya.

31:03.505 --> 31:07.473
She's got this idea
that I just do whatever Janet says.

31:11.433 --> 31:13.492
I mean, if we were questioning her,

31:13.493 --> 31:15.468
I can see how it should be
both of us.

31:15.469 --> 31:17.469
But to take her to an appointment?

31:17.494 --> 31:19.452
When Janet says 'above board'...

31:19.453 --> 31:21.484
She probably meant
don't pash her on the street.

31:21.485 --> 31:24.440
I think it's a bit more than that,
but...

31:24.441 --> 31:27.853
If you want me to take you back...
No, hardly worth it now.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.444
Here's a question.

31:32.445 --> 31:37.476
Five years ago when we started at
the DPP, you, me, Erin, Tatum, Ben,

31:37.477 --> 31:39.444
all standing next to each other,

31:39.445 --> 31:42.425
where did you see yourself
in five years time?

31:45.517 --> 31:50.444
Actually, I thought
I'd get a few years experience,

31:50.445 --> 31:53.681
then take the bar exam
and start building my own career.

31:54.497 --> 31:56.481
So what happened?

32:00.469 --> 32:03.940
WOMAN: What you've described
isn't remembering the incident,

32:03.965 --> 32:08.083
but reliving it, which is a classic
indicator of post-traumatic stress.

32:09.457 --> 32:13.473
Well, can I still go overseas?
I'm doing Europe soon.

32:18.485 --> 32:21.662
Let's go back to that night
and describe what happened.

32:21.687 --> 32:25.472
Take it slowly.
Try to remember every detail.

32:25.473 --> 32:28.457
Everything?
As much as you can.

32:30.505 --> 32:34.469
Close your eyes
and describe just what you heard.

32:40.497 --> 32:42.492
TODD: (Flashback) I know.

32:42.493 --> 32:45.456
I know that I brought it.

32:45.457 --> 32:47.436
Todd was saying,

32:47.437 --> 32:49.452
'It's in here somewhere.'
I know that I had it...

32:49.453 --> 32:52.571
(Bag unzips) ..when I left.
I heard him unzip the bag.

32:52.572 --> 32:53.619
I heard a train.

32:53.620 --> 32:56.508
The screech and the rumble
as it went past.

32:56.509 --> 32:59.512
(Fireworks pop)
There were fireworks.

32:59.513 --> 33:03.508
And then the bang from the gunshot.

33:03.509 --> 33:06.448
(Screaming)
A scream.

33:06.449 --> 33:08.685
A thump as Todd fell back
into the car.

33:08.686 --> 33:10.689
Todd screamed when he was shot?

33:10.690 --> 33:13.448
No. No, it was...
..it was high-pitched.

33:13.449 --> 33:18.437
You screamed.
Yes, I started screaming and crying.

33:19.517 --> 33:21.505
There was a different scream.

33:23.513 --> 33:27.505
But not Todd?
No and before me.

33:33.437 --> 33:35.480
A witness?
It must have been.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.456
RICHARD: But no-one saw it?
No - some woman did and screamed.

33:38.457 --> 33:41.492
I remember.
I didn't see her, but I heard her.

33:41.493 --> 33:43.460
We've got to get back to the office.

33:43.461 --> 33:45.444
If we've got another witness,
that's gold.

33:45.445 --> 33:46.512
Brilliant. Well done.
You're a genius.

33:46.513 --> 33:50.456
Glad some good came out of that
freak-out I had the other night.

33:50.457 --> 33:51.516
I'm so sorry
I couldn't help you out.

33:51.517 --> 33:53.469
That's OK.
I'm glad Brett could.

33:54.469 --> 33:56.441
How did you know it was Brett?

33:59.339 --> 34:00.516
Thank you, everyone.

34:00.517 --> 34:03.488
Having read the parties' affidavits
and written submissions,

34:03.489 --> 34:05.666
I have decided
that I am in a position

34:05.691 --> 34:10.467
to make a decision viva voce,
with a written judgment to follow.

34:10.469 --> 34:13.431
Janet King was the partner
of Ashleigh Larsson.

34:13.433 --> 34:14.516
They went into this venture
collectively,

34:14.516 --> 34:19.467
notwithstanding whose genetic
material was used in the process.

34:19.469 --> 34:22.444
These facts are not in dispute
by any of the parties.

34:22.445 --> 34:26.480
Accordingly, I do declare that the
frozen embryo presently in storage

34:26.481 --> 34:28.484
forms part of the estate
of Ms Larsson,

34:28.485 --> 34:32.487
and will now be held in the name
of the first respondent, Janet King.

34:32.489 --> 34:35.440
What? Please, Your Honour...
I'm sorry, I don't think...

34:35.440 --> 34:36.480
Order! Order.

34:36.481 --> 34:39.467
I make no finding as to whether
the item is property or life.

34:39.469 --> 34:42.487
The item is now Ms King's
to do with as she pleases.

34:42.489 --> 34:44.452
Thank you.

34:44.453 --> 34:46.431
What's next?

34:46.433 --> 34:47.512
WOMAN: Hirst and Armfield.

34:47.513 --> 34:50.444
Are the respondents present
for this matter?

34:50.445 --> 34:52.425
MAN: We are, yes, Your Honour.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.496
(Laughs)

34:54.496 --> 34:56.467
Happy?
Oh, I don't know.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.822
I'm more relieved than happy.
(SMS alert)

34:59.517 --> 35:02.468
No, I am. I'm happy.
I'm glad it's over.

35:02.469 --> 35:04.432
Who are you?

35:04.433 --> 35:06.484
Did you even once stop to think
about what Ash wanted?

35:06.485 --> 35:10.448
No, because as usual
all you think about is yourself.

35:10.449 --> 35:12.424
Deb...
Shut up!

35:12.425 --> 35:14.461
Just shut up.

35:18.433 --> 35:22.480
Oh, shit. Six missed calls
from Lina and Richard.

35:22.481 --> 35:24.500
Problem?

35:24.501 --> 35:27.432
There was a witness
to the Todd Wilson shooting.

35:27.433 --> 35:29.610
Hang on, I just need
to call him back.

35:29.635 --> 35:31.635
(Ringing tone)

35:34.494 --> 35:37.436
RICHARD: Janet.
Richard, I just got all your texts.

35:37.437 --> 35:39.512
KEISHA: It's Janet? I suppose
she knows what shirt I'm wearing.

35:39.513 --> 35:42.440
Can I call you back?
Richard...

35:42.441 --> 35:44.460
Keisha knows that
we had surveillance in her house

35:44.461 --> 35:46.468
and her flatmates
brought some pot home yesterday

35:46.469 --> 35:48.472
and it'll all be on camera.

35:48.473 --> 35:50.464
OK, OK, don't panic. I'll see...

35:50.465 --> 35:53.460
I'm dealing with it.
Can I just call you back later?

35:53.461 --> 35:55.500
What now?
Ah, this is about something else.

35:55.501 --> 35:58.508
I'm just reminding Richard
about the Filipetti case.

35:58.509 --> 36:01.157
You know, putting the drugs
in the communal...

36:01.182 --> 36:03.469
I know, I know.
OK, done.

36:03.469 --> 36:05.492
Ah, something about a witness.

36:05.493 --> 36:09.493
Yeah, it says here they don't know
who it is yet, but Lina's onto it.

36:09.494 --> 36:11.553
(Laughs) A toast to having minions.

36:11.578 --> 36:13.557
(Snorts) Let's get out of here.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.512
So Keisha's certain she heard
a witness scream when Todd was shot?

36:22.513 --> 36:24.504
Yep. Now it's just a matter
of finding her.

36:24.505 --> 36:27.448
What about the calls
that came after the media appeal?

36:27.449 --> 36:29.436
We've triple checked.
She's not among them.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.448
OK. If you need to get out there
and doorknock, go for it.

36:32.449 --> 36:34.472
Hey, listen, Amil still
hasn't made any phone calls

36:34.473 --> 36:36.496
and as far as we know,
he hasn't talked to anybody.

36:36.497 --> 36:38.452
He's just ignoring it.
Completely?

36:38.453 --> 36:40.453
Like, 'Container? What container?'

36:40.454 --> 36:42.517
(Sighs) So any suggestions?
Go surfing, play golf?

36:42.518 --> 36:45.436
I mean, what else can we do
except wait?

36:45.437 --> 36:48.790
Given the pressure for progress,
we can't wait any longer.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.933
Well, the options
are pretty limited.

36:53.469 --> 36:55.500
Hang on, where is it?

36:55.501 --> 36:57.456
Were the cleaners in last night?

36:57.457 --> 37:00.460
No. No, they wouldn't take an iPad
anyway. That's way too obvious.

37:00.461 --> 37:02.516
It was on my desk. I know it was,
because I Skyped the kids

37:02.517 --> 37:05.428
and Mum had put them to bed early,
so...

37:05.429 --> 37:09.484
According to this, Heather was
in here at 2:16am for seven minutes.

37:09.485 --> 37:12.476
At quarter past two in the morning?
Apparently.

37:12.477 --> 37:15.889
Or at least it was her security code
that opened the doors.

37:15.914 --> 37:18.444
Hey, Heather! Here a sec?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.448
Don't we have cameras in here?
Not infra-red.

37:20.449 --> 37:22.516
With no lights, we'd be looking
for a black cat in a coalmine.

37:22.517 --> 37:24.576
Can we fix that today, please?
Sure.

37:25.457 --> 37:28.516
I sent you a note about
the SEC's opinion of Customs.

37:28.517 --> 37:31.468
Got that, thanks.
Um... how was Roger?

37:31.469 --> 37:33.488
As patriarchal as ever?

37:33.489 --> 37:35.508
He tried to pull you down
a peg or two in my eyes.

37:35.509 --> 37:37.492
Successfully?
Not really.

37:37.493 --> 37:39.460
Basically, I said against him,

37:39.461 --> 37:42.456
you'd win a dick measuring
competition without even having one.

37:42.457 --> 37:44.460
Hm, he would have loved that.

37:44.461 --> 37:47.991
Those weren't my exact words,
but I think he got the message.

37:50.437 --> 37:52.469
Is that all?
Um...

37:52.469 --> 37:55.469
Where were you, ah, last night
after midnight?

37:57.469 --> 37:59.477
Asleep.
Anyone verify?

38:00.477 --> 38:02.449
Yes.
Who?

38:07.429 --> 38:11.452
If I'm under official investigation,
I'll give you his name.

38:11.453 --> 38:14.464
Until then,
a bit of trust would be nice.

38:14.465 --> 38:16.496
Have you written
your security code anywhere?

38:16.497 --> 38:18.452
Told anyone? Let people see it?

38:18.453 --> 38:19.500
No.

38:19.501 --> 38:21.913
Someone used it
to get in here last night.

38:21.938 --> 38:23.476
As far as I can remember,

38:23.477 --> 38:25.476
I just stand like this
and press the buttons.

38:25.477 --> 38:28.536
I've never seen anyone behind me,
at least not close.

38:28.561 --> 38:31.738
But if you're like that,
well, maybe from this angle...

38:32.441 --> 38:35.460
If someone was looking
along this line

38:35.461 --> 38:39.436
and had a good pair of binoculars
or a long lens camera,

38:39.437 --> 38:42.555
they could have been on that seat
or by that bus stop.

38:42.580 --> 38:45.424
Thatseat.
Well, anywhere along this line -

38:45.425 --> 38:48.449
No, the seat.
The man was sitting on the seat.

38:49.481 --> 38:51.453
The coffee girl. Where is she?

38:53.433 --> 38:54.504
Two or three hours maybe.
I don't know.

38:54.505 --> 38:56.460
I didn't have a stopwatch on him,

38:56.461 --> 38:58.476
butitwasmostofthemorning.
And he just sat there?

38:58.477 --> 39:00.440
He was there whenever I looked,

39:00.441 --> 39:02.480
so every five or ten minutes
I guess I'd look over.

39:02.481 --> 39:06.424
A bit more towards the end
when I was a bit more curious.

39:06.425 --> 39:07.661
Can you describe him?

39:07.686 --> 39:11.460
Um... dark hair, black pants.
Asian, I think.

39:11.461 --> 39:15.424
You think?
He was 50 metres away.

39:15.425 --> 39:17.468
Can't be certain.

39:17.469 --> 39:19.488
Age?
30s, I guess.

39:19.489 --> 39:22.516
Had you seen him before?
Idon'tthinkso.

39:22.517 --> 39:26.437
But you know, that doesn't mean
he hasn't been hanging around.

39:27.437 --> 39:29.516
OK. Well thanks, Peta.

39:29.517 --> 39:33.480
And sorry, it's Peta...
Vickers.

39:33.481 --> 39:34.810
Vickers.

39:34.836 --> 39:38.072
Alright. Well, if you see him again,
please let us know.

39:38.097 --> 39:39.830
Sure.

39:39.856 --> 39:41.440
Thanks, Andy.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.448
What's he done?
Or shouldn't I ask?

39:45.449 --> 39:47.685
I guess
it's not something you can say.

39:48.457 --> 39:51.448
How are you doing? In general?

39:51.449 --> 39:53.492
Is that a secret too?
Perhaps.

39:53.493 --> 39:56.500
But listen, thanks for your help.
It could be really important.

39:56.501 --> 39:58.496
No, that's OK. I'm glad to help.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.512
And it's nice to chat a bit.

40:00.513 --> 40:03.749
I wondered what sort of person
takes on a job like this.

40:03.774 --> 40:05.468
So have I lately.
Yeah.

40:05.469 --> 40:09.469
And now you know that I can do more
than just make a good flat white.

40:09.469 --> 40:12.646
And quote Oscar Wilde.
Mm, full of hidden talents, huh?

40:15.465 --> 40:17.460
Right, so there you go.

40:17.461 --> 40:20.464
If you want more,
you know where to find me.

40:20.465 --> 40:22.440
Thanks. Thanks, Peta.

40:22.441 --> 40:23.497
OK.

40:29.453 --> 40:32.460
Ah, Janet! Glad you're here.

40:32.461 --> 40:34.516
I'm showing Lincoln around.
He asked where you were based.

40:34.517 --> 40:36.468
Hope you don't mind?
No, no.

40:36.469 --> 40:38.940
An unexpected surprise,
but no, not at all.

40:38.965 --> 40:41.440
I've just been inspecting
netball courts.

40:41.441 --> 40:43.516
I can't imagine a better way
to spend an afternoon.

40:43.517 --> 40:46.635
It is the number one
participation sport in Australia.

40:46.660 --> 40:48.436
My point exactly.

40:48.437 --> 40:50.484
More registered players
than Aussie rules, union, league,

40:50.485 --> 40:52.500
cricket or soccer,
but, oh, to hell with it,

40:52.501 --> 40:55.440
let's rip out the courts
and put in a gambling hall.

40:55.441 --> 40:56.496
Why not? That's the Aussie spirit.

40:56.497 --> 40:59.439
And I shall take your argument
to cabinet, Patrick.

40:59.464 --> 41:01.876
There's no need to sell me
anything twice.

41:02.465 --> 41:04.433
Could you give us a minute?

41:05.509 --> 41:08.484
A rare insight into
how mates lobby each other.

41:08.485 --> 41:10.440
Oh, not really.

41:10.441 --> 41:13.480
He's still $4 million short
of his competition, unfortunately,

41:13.481 --> 41:16.444
which won't please
my cabinet colleagues at all -

41:16.445 --> 41:18.476
mate or no mate.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.485
Moving on, however,
I did want a quick chat.

41:23.469 --> 41:26.465
In 24 hours,
I need an executive summary

41:26.465 --> 41:28.642
of what will be
in your interim report

41:28.667 --> 41:31.424
and I need evidence
it will be written.

41:31.425 --> 41:32.896
I can't promise anything.

41:32.921 --> 41:35.424
Oh, but I can.

41:35.425 --> 41:37.073
The view is nice at the top,

41:37.098 --> 41:40.114
but one misstep
and it's a very, very hard fall.

41:41.461 --> 41:43.437
I'm looking forward to the read.

41:58.457 --> 42:00.508
I thought we had weeks
to finish this operation?

42:00.509 --> 42:02.568
Not now.
JANET: We've got no choice.

42:02.593 --> 42:04.440
Just write a report.

42:04.441 --> 42:05.512
Who cares what it is?
It has to be real.

42:05.513 --> 42:07.512
It just has to save his neck.
No, it doesn't.

42:07.513 --> 42:10.460
I won't write anything
unless I can defend it.

42:10.461 --> 42:12.428
He can't force me to play his game.

42:12.429 --> 42:13.491
Well, he is,
judging by this meeting.

42:13.492 --> 42:15.964
This isn't just
about the Attorney-General.

42:15.989 --> 42:18.107
The victims' families
are out there -

42:18.517 --> 42:21.492
parents, sibling,
partners, children -

42:21.493 --> 42:23.670
and if we're gonna stop the shooting,

42:23.695 --> 42:26.048
the commission does need
the big answers.

42:26.465 --> 42:29.464
We need to get to someone who knows
who brought in those first guns.

42:29.465 --> 42:33.440
And if no-one's picking up the
container, that someone is Felix.

42:33.441 --> 42:35.508
Bianca, if you can get Felix
to name the person who shot him,

42:35.509 --> 42:37.488
that opens up everything.

42:37.489 --> 42:39.452
But now I need him fast.

42:39.453 --> 42:42.428
The long game was to let him
form an attachment to Steph,

42:42.429 --> 42:43.508
let that grow
into emotional commitment,

42:43.509 --> 42:46.476
then make that bond so tight
he couldn't say no.

42:46.477 --> 42:49.425
And the short game?
Do we have one?

42:50.425 --> 42:52.484
It will have to be something big...

42:52.509 --> 42:55.440
..life or death, probably -
sudden, now.

42:55.441 --> 42:57.504
If he genuinely believed
I was gonna die without help

42:57.505 --> 42:59.505
and he couldn't help me himself...

43:00.501 --> 43:03.428
..maybe then.
A kidnap, that could work.

43:03.429 --> 43:06.432
No coulds. What will work
beyond reasonable doubt?

43:06.433 --> 43:07.728
It's got to be simple.

43:07.753 --> 43:09.436
And hard - in your face.

43:09.437 --> 43:11.484
And I need an ex - I think
he's got to see him in action,

43:11.485 --> 43:13.449
not just hear about him.

43:29.493 --> 43:31.445
Any sign yet?

43:32.445 --> 43:34.424
Hey, what's this?

43:34.425 --> 43:35.955
It's OK. It's for the job.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.484
Is it make-up?
Jesus!

43:37.485 --> 43:40.480
Not this time. Felix might touch it,
put ice on it.

43:40.481 --> 43:42.456
Make-up would run.
It had to be real.

43:42.457 --> 43:43.504
So... so who...?

43:43.505 --> 43:45.496
It doesn't matter, it's done.

43:45.497 --> 43:48.424
Did you know about this?
No.

43:48.425 --> 43:50.500
So she did that to herself?
What, just picked a fight in a pub?

43:50.501 --> 43:53.384
Don't worry, it's happened.
Does Janet know you...

43:53.409 --> 43:56.440
Just go with it, OK?
How it happened doesn't matter.

43:56.441 --> 43:59.383
Felix has to think you did it.
That's what matters.

44:07.481 --> 44:09.437
OK, he's coming.

44:13.497 --> 44:15.453
Here we go.

44:16.453 --> 44:19.395
I don't know why I got
to wait here all day, Steph!

44:19.420 --> 44:21.440
I don't fucking know! Eh?

44:21.441 --> 44:24.480
So why don't you tell me
what you told the royal commission?

44:24.481 --> 44:27.443
Why don't you tell me?
(Sobs) I didn't tell them anything!

44:27.444 --> 44:29.429
Stop lying to me!
(Sobs) I'm not. I'm not.

44:29.429 --> 44:30.504
You've been lying to me
all bloody week!

44:30.505 --> 44:33.512
It's pretty bloody simple. Tell me
what you told the royal commission.

44:33.513 --> 44:35.468
Just tell me.
It wasn't anything.

44:35.469 --> 44:36.512
Stop lying to me!

44:36.513 --> 44:41.448
Hey? How come you got out
so quick if you didn't talk - how?

44:41.449 --> 44:44.436
I don't know!
Because you talked, didn't you?

44:44.437 --> 44:46.432
You talked!
I know you said something.

44:46.433 --> 44:47.516
Everyone knows. Everyone knows.
(Whimpers)

44:47.517 --> 44:50.476
So all you've got to do
is tell me what you said.

44:50.477 --> 44:53.536
(Whimpers) I didn't!
You want some more of this, huh?

44:55.461 --> 44:57.873
I've got plenty more
where this came from.

44:57.898 --> 44:59.858
(Sobs) Please don't!

45:15.517 --> 45:17.509
(Click!)

45:23.477 --> 45:26.473
Tomorrow, this is gonna be loaded.

45:27.477 --> 45:30.654
And we're not going through
this shit again at all, OK?

45:30.679 --> 45:32.856
Right, bitch,
you get where I'm going?

45:41.477 --> 45:43.449
(Sobs)

45:56.386 --> 45:58.445
OK. I've got to get you
to hospital.

45:58.445 --> 46:00.456
No, no, I can walk. It's OK.

46:00.457 --> 46:01.508
OK.

46:01.509 --> 46:03.468
What sort of person...

46:03.469 --> 46:06.460
I still think you should have gone
with a harmless little report.

46:06.461 --> 46:10.050
(Sobs) I can't do anything!
Well, let's see if it works first.

46:10.075 --> 46:11.484
It's gonna be OK.

46:11.485 --> 46:14.480
(Sobs) How can I stop him? I can't!

46:14.481 --> 46:16.540
(Gently) It's OK. It's gonna be OK.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.573
OK, it's alright. It's OK.

46:28.493 --> 46:31.425
Thanks for going with it.

46:32.513 --> 46:34.477
Let's hope it's not for nothing.

46:59.513 --> 47:02.452
She just threw
the mother of all curve balls.

47:02.453 --> 47:03.505
I'll talk to her.

47:09.517 --> 47:11.489
(Knocks)

47:15.453 --> 47:17.440
Thanks.

47:17.441 --> 47:19.147
You should see the other guy.

47:19.172 --> 47:21.456
Well, you sure gave Andy a fright.

47:21.457 --> 47:23.464
We had one shot
at getting that name,

47:23.465 --> 47:26.428
changing his entire belief system
so that he'd give it up.

47:26.429 --> 47:27.959
I had to cover all bases -

47:27.984 --> 47:30.220
psychological threats,
physical damage.

47:34.449 --> 47:36.437
Who did this to you?

47:37.445 --> 47:39.428
Look, it's the job.

47:39.429 --> 47:41.606
No-one's breached
the Crimes Act here.

47:43.469 --> 47:47.469
I couldn't live with myself, knowing
there's more we could have done.

47:51.465 --> 47:53.469
Now we wait.

47:57.497 --> 48:01.504
Did Filippetti do the trick?
Yes, it did. Thank you very much.

48:01.505 --> 48:04.444
Drugs in the living room,
no proof of ownership.

48:04.445 --> 48:07.429
Keisha is very relieved
now the cameras are gone.

48:08.469 --> 48:10.512
Hey, hey. Where have you been?

48:10.513 --> 48:14.448
Just, um... looking into
that breach in security.

48:14.449 --> 48:17.449
Ruling out possibilities,
checking on the container.

48:17.474 --> 48:20.454
I'm, uh... I'm pretty busy.
I gotta go.

48:22.445 --> 48:26.441
I begged Felix so hard.
It was shameless.

48:27.441 --> 48:29.484
I said, 'Whoever shot you
had to be scarier than my ex.'

48:29.485 --> 48:31.436
I didn't want a name.

48:31.437 --> 48:32.512
Just someone to get rid
of this dickhead...

48:32.513 --> 48:34.572
(Phone chimes)
..before he kills me.

48:42.461 --> 48:44.638
He's coming to Steph's house
tomorrow.

48:48.461 --> 48:50.468
The guy who shot Felix.

48:50.469 --> 48:52.441
He's coming.

48:56.453 --> 48:58.516
W-We got him!
Good.

48:58.517 --> 49:00.516
Good! OK.

49:00.517 --> 49:04.424
Well, um... I should go
back to my room so I can...

49:04.425 --> 49:06.428
No, um...

49:06.429 --> 49:08.448
Please, stay.

49:08.449 --> 49:11.492
The least I can do is look after you.

49:11.493 --> 49:15.476
You need to at least ice that
all through the night, right?

49:15.477 --> 49:18.449
A bit of TLC for the wounded warrior.

49:19.509 --> 49:22.432
Hopefully there's some ice here.

49:22.433 --> 49:23.481
Yes!

49:27.481 --> 49:31.129
Look, I know the job's about
getting close to dangerous people,

49:31.154 --> 49:35.122
but even you have to admit that...

49:37.433 --> 49:39.492
..this is a different league, yeah?

49:40.444 --> 49:42.444
Just trying to impress you, Janet.

49:42.445 --> 49:44.468
Well, it worked.

49:44.469 --> 49:46.441
Ow!
Shit, sorry.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.448
(Chuckles)

49:48.449 --> 49:50.473
You little shit!

49:51.493 --> 49:54.517
Thank you. This is... nice.

49:59.469 --> 50:03.646
You know we're gonna still miss the
Attorney-General's 24-hour deadline.

50:05.485 --> 50:07.452
Ah, fuck him.

50:07.453 --> 50:09.429
You need to sleep.

50:11.453 --> 50:13.465
And I...

50:14.473 --> 50:16.489
..I will keep watch.

50:33.445 --> 50:35.469
(Birds chirp)

50:37.449 --> 50:39.457
(Knock at door)
(Gasps)

50:42.489 --> 50:44.500
(Drowsily) Wha...?

50:44.501 --> 50:47.492
(Knocking)
OK, what?

50:47.493 --> 50:49.464
Yes?

50:49.465 --> 50:52.484
MAN: Miss Janet King?
Uh, who is this?

50:52.485 --> 50:55.956
I'm agent Steven Moore from
the State Corruption Commission.

50:55.981 --> 50:58.973
We have a search warrant
for these premises.

51:00.509 --> 51:02.460
I beg your pardon?

51:02.461 --> 51:03.932
Hang on, what are you...?

51:03.957 --> 51:07.452
We have authority to confiscate
all phones, computers

51:07.453 --> 51:10.473
and devices capable of storing
or transmitting digital information.

51:10.473 --> 51:12.448
What is this about?

51:12.449 --> 51:13.508
Hers too.

51:13.509 --> 51:16.456
Miss King, we have
anonymous information

51:16.457 --> 51:18.428
regarding serious corrupt behaviour

51:18.429 --> 51:20.440
which could result
in criminal charges.

51:20.441 --> 51:23.428
Further details about this matter
will be forthcoming

51:23.429 --> 51:26.440
at a preliminary hearing
of the State Corruption Commission

51:26.441 --> 51:27.736
on a date to be fixed.

51:27.761 --> 51:29.761
Thanks for your cooperation.

51:33.497 --> 51:35.469
What the hell's going on?

51:36.513 --> 51:39.441
I don't know.
This must be Lincoln Priest.

51:40.441 --> 51:43.324
If this is the A-G,
this is pretty bloody serious.

51:43.349 --> 51:47.467
How do they know you're here? This
is supposed to be a secure facility.

51:50.469 --> 51:52.822
Uh, let's...
We'll talk about this later.

51:52.847 --> 51:55.965
You go. We need to keep going
with this undercover op.

52:17.429 --> 52:18.606
They took yours too?

52:18.631 --> 52:21.468
My phone.
Laptops, iPads.

52:21.469 --> 52:23.452
OK, what about you?
No.

52:23.453 --> 52:26.448
No, it's just me and Lina.
Feeling a bit left out, actually.

52:26.449 --> 52:28.451
What is it about?
I don't know and I'm sorry.

52:28.452 --> 52:30.504
I know the type of exchanges
people have on their phones.

52:30.505 --> 52:34.429
I'll do what I can to stop them
becoming public, I promise.

52:34.429 --> 52:36.841
In the meantime,
let's just... keep going.

52:37.481 --> 52:39.477
Owen?

53:00.449 --> 53:02.567
How'd you sleep? Looks like it hurt.

53:02.592 --> 53:05.576
Luckily, winners
don't feel the pain as much.

53:07.493 --> 53:09.468
You ready?

53:09.469 --> 53:11.764
And what the hell happened
this morning?

53:11.789 --> 53:14.848
Were you caught up in that?
Yeah, they took my phone.

53:15.465 --> 53:16.517
(Sighs)

53:21.517 --> 53:23.468
(Exhales)

53:23.469 --> 53:26.440
Did you know about
the Corruption Commission?

53:26.441 --> 53:28.456
What?

53:28.457 --> 53:31.105
Anonymous information -
that's what they said.

53:31.130 --> 53:34.436
Call me suspicious,
but it smacks of insider info...

53:34.437 --> 53:36.432
Cut the bullshit, Janet.

53:36.433 --> 53:39.257
I'm on your side.
Really? I've heard that before.

53:39.282 --> 53:40.468
I'm working for you.

53:40.469 --> 53:42.472
Obviously, Lincoln's behind it.

53:42.473 --> 53:45.429
It's nothing to do with me.
OK, OK. Here he is.

53:47.493 --> 53:52.425
I told you, Steph. I told you
I need to know what you told them.

53:52.425 --> 53:54.440
I need to know
what you told them, OK?

53:54.441 --> 53:56.472
I didn't tell them...
(Shouts) Tell me what you said!

53:56.473 --> 53:58.512
I don't know what you've told them!
I need to know!

53:58.513 --> 54:00.690
Please don't hurt me.
(Shouts angrily)

54:00.715 --> 54:04.667
I know you said something!
Tell me what it is.

54:06.505 --> 54:08.489
Fuck!

54:12.485 --> 54:14.444
Brett.

54:14.445 --> 54:16.477
(Argument continues)

54:20.485 --> 54:22.603
Please don't hurt me.
(Knock at door)

54:22.628 --> 54:24.632
(Phone rings)

54:26.425 --> 54:29.778
It's Brett Bonar. He knows
you're a cop. Don't let him in.

54:29.803 --> 54:30.851
(Door opens)

55:34.517 --> 55:38.461
(Gunshots)

55:43.441 --> 55:44.516
He's dead.

55:44.517 --> 55:47.448
MAN: This royal commission of yours

55:47.449 --> 55:49.861
is set up to protect us
from gun violence?

55:49.886 --> 55:51.504
Shame on you, Miss King!

55:51.505 --> 55:53.493
God forbid you do anything
to upset your boss!

55:53.494 --> 55:55.441
It's got nothing to do with her.

55:55.441 --> 55:57.468
You always do what she says.
She's usually right!

55:57.469 --> 55:59.500
MAN: Our searches
through your personal devices

55:59.501 --> 56:02.031
have confirmed
the allegation has substance.

56:02.056 --> 56:05.440
If behaviour looks,
sounds or smells corrupt,

56:05.441 --> 56:07.472
then it probably is.

56:07.473 --> 56:10.447
Jesus, Janet, you do not
want another court case now.

56:10.448 --> 56:11.920
We will provide security.

56:11.945 --> 56:14.240
You got me
to sign my own death warrant.
