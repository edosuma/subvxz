00:44.700 --> 00:47.191
<i>It's blind instinct.</i>

00:47.995 --> 00:51.328
<i>But now it is Creed coming back</i>
<i>with the left hand!</i>

00:51.457 --> 00:55.585
<i>What's keeping these two guys up?</i>
<i>A tremendous closing moment!</i>

00:58.830 --> 01:02.910
<i>Here comes Balboa back,</i>
<i>but the champion's back with another left.</i>

01:09.006 --> 01:13.882
<i>A right hand! It's Creed.</i>
<i>Now it's Balboa! Now it's Creed.</i>

01:14.011 --> 01:18.009
<i>A tremendous left by Rocky.</i>
<i>They're dead in the centre, toe to toe!</i>

01:36.159 --> 01:38.151
One!

01:40.496 --> 01:41.496
Two!

01:41.622 --> 01:47.495
<i>Creed will retain the title.</i>
<i>If neither gets up, Creed will win the title.</i>

01:47.837 --> 01:50.209
- Four!
- Get up, my man.

01:50.339 --> 01:51.964
God!

01:53.217 --> 01:54.217
Six.

01:54.343 --> 01:57.048
<i>Each fighter is trying to beat the count!</i>

01:57.180 --> 01:58.804
Get up there!

01:59.307 --> 02:01.299
Eight!

02:02.059 --> 02:04.597
- Nine!
<i>- The champ is down.</i>

02:04.729 --> 02:07.480
Ten!

02:09.108 --> 02:12.109
<i>He's done it at the last second!</i>

02:12.236 --> 02:15.486
<i>He made it!</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa has shocked the world!</i>

02:15.615 --> 02:18.651
<i>He is the new heavyweight</i>
<i>champion of the world!</i>

02:19.869 --> 02:22.027
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:22.163 --> 02:27.039
in a stunning upset,
scoring a win by knockout,

02:27.168 --> 02:30.453
the new heavyweight
champion of the world,

02:31.964 --> 02:35.583
Rocky Balboa!

02:36.886 --> 02:38.962
Excuse me. Excuse me.

02:40.014 --> 02:44.012
I just wanna say one thing -
to my wife, who's home.

02:46.729 --> 02:49.516
Yo, Adrian. I did it!

02:49.649 --> 02:53.018
I love you. I love you.

03:53.087 --> 03:56.337
<i>~ Risin' up, back on the street ~</i>

03:57.550 --> 04:00.219
<i>~ Did my time, took my chances ~</i>

04:01.971 --> 04:05.055
<i>~ Went the distance</i>
<i>Now I'm back on my feet ~</i>

04:05.183 --> 04:08.765
<i>~ Just a man and his will to survive ~</i>

04:10.438 --> 04:13.688
<i>~ So many times, it happens too fast ~</i>

04:14.901 --> 04:18.151
<i>~ You change your passion for glory ~</i>

04:19.029 --> 04:22.695
<i>~ Don't lose your grip</i>
<i>On the dreams of the past ~</i>

04:22.825 --> 04:27.155
<i>~ You must fight just to keep them alive ~</i>

04:27.288 --> 04:31.333

<i>It's the thrill of the fight ~</i>

04:31.459 --> 04:35.920

<i>~ And he's watching us all with the eye ~</i>

04:44.931 --> 04:46.970
<i>~ Of the tiger ~</i>

04:50.603 --> 04:54.019
<i>~ Face to face, out in the heat ~</i>

04:54.982 --> 04:57.983
<i>~ Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry ~</i>

04:59.111 --> 05:02.611
<i>~ They stack the odds</i>
<i>Still we take to the street ~</i>

05:02.740 --> 05:06.820
<i>~ For the kill, with the skill to survive ~</i>

05:06.994 --> 05:10.944
<i>~ It's the eye of the tiger</i>
<i>It's the thrill of the fight ~</i>

05:11.082 --> 05:15.660
<i>~ Risin' up to the challenge of our rival ~</i>

05:15.795 --> 05:19.793
<i>~ And the last known survivor</i>
<i>Stalks his prey in the night ~</i>

05:20.091 --> 05:24.504
<i>~ And he's watching us all with the eye ~</i>

05:24.637 --> 05:27.093
<i>~ Of the tiger ~</i>

05:34.522 --> 05:38.105
<i>~ Risin' up, straight to the top ~</i>

05:39.110 --> 05:42.027
<i>~ Had the guts, got the glory ~</i>

05:43.406 --> 05:46.656
<i>~ Went the distance</i>
<i>Now I'm not gonna stop ~</i>

05:46.784 --> 05:50.319
<i>~ Just a man and his will to survive ~</i>

05:51.080 --> 05:55.160
<i>~ It's the eye of the tiger</i>

<i>~ Of the tiger ~</i>

06:23.613 --> 06:25.901
<i>~ The eye of the tiger ~</i>

06:32.330 --> 06:34.572
<i>~ The eye of the tiger ~</i>

06:36.584 --> 06:39.620
I want Balboa. I want Balboa.

06:39.754 --> 06:44.665
You hear that, old man? You tell Balboa.
Nobody can beat me. Tell him what I said.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.885
And he's next. I'm gonna kill him.
Nobody can stop me.

06:48.012 --> 06:51.179
You tell Balboa that. I'm comin' after him.

06:51.807 --> 06:56.101
<i>I want a shot at the title if Balboa's</i>
<i>got the guts to meet me in the ring.</i>

06:56.229 --> 06:59.395
<i>My whole life's been directed</i>
<i>towards this title.</i>

06:59.524 --> 07:03.652
<i>I live alone. I train alone.</i>
<i>I'll win the title alone. I want him.</i>

07:03.945 --> 07:07.859
<i>He can't duck me forever.</i>
<i>He can run, but he can't hide.</i>

07:07.990 --> 07:10.660
<i>Another southpaw,</i>
<i>champion Rocky Balboa,</i>

07:10.868 --> 07:13.110
<i>isn't worried about much these days.</i>

07:13.246 --> 07:15.653
<i>He's defended his title for the tenth time</i>

07:15.790 --> 07:20.333
<i>and will face the world heavyweight</i>
<i>wrestling champion in a charity benefit,</i>

07:20.461 --> 07:23.498
<i>with all the proceeds</i>
<i>to go to a local youth foundation.</i>

07:23.631 --> 07:28.293
<i>I'll have to give him credit. Mr Balboa</i>
<i>stays busy. He's a true sportsman.</i>

07:28.427 --> 07:33.136
<i>It looks like the no. 1 contender, Clubber</i>
<i>Lang, will have to play the waiting game.</i>

07:33.266 --> 07:35.673
<i>But that should be a great match-up.</i>

07:35.810 --> 07:38.217
Paulie, take it easy, OK?

07:41.107 --> 07:43.099
Hey, you goin'?

07:43.234 --> 07:46.235
Hey,
don't forget to give Rocky my best, huh?

07:46.988 --> 07:49.989
You know, I've been comin' here years.

07:50.116 --> 07:54.363
How 'bout you give me,
Paulie, your best once?

07:55.079 --> 07:57.831
Take it easy, Paulie.

07:57.957 --> 08:01.658
Hey, Paulie, you heard me?

08:01.794 --> 08:05.543
When you see the Rock,
tell him the boys all said "Hey"!

09:52.321 --> 09:54.361
Paulie.

09:58.327 --> 10:01.281
You wanna hear I owe ya?
You, I owe nothin'.

10:01.414 --> 10:03.656
Nah, you don't owe me nothin'.

10:03.791 --> 10:06.080
So, what do ya want I should do?

10:06.210 --> 10:09.045
- My sister ain't here?
- She's home.

10:09.172 --> 10:12.375
Me and her were tight until you come in.

10:12.508 --> 10:14.916
I raised her. She don't come down.

10:15.052 --> 10:17.425
She don't know about this.

10:17.555 --> 10:19.797
You and her can go to hell,
you know that?

10:19.932 --> 10:21.972
Watch your mouth, Paulie.

10:22.101 --> 10:26.015
You gonna whack me?
I don't sweat you. Come on.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.270
Come on, Paul. Screw your head on right.

10:28.399 --> 10:32.266
Nah, your freakin' head
is the one on wrong.

10:32.403 --> 10:36.567
- Yeah? What did I do?
- What'd ya do? Nothin'.

10:36.699 --> 10:41.741
For yourself? Oh, nice! You fixed
your face up handsome. Nice clothes.

10:41.871 --> 10:45.536
What'd ya do for Paulie?
Three years - did ya get me a job?

10:45.666 --> 10:50.459
Look at this! You gave me
a lousy stinkin' Ex-Lax watch. This!

10:51.547 --> 10:54.750
- Paulie...
- What? What?

10:54.884 --> 10:57.126
That's right. No, leave it down!

10:57.261 --> 10:59.835
It never kept good time anyway.

11:00.681 --> 11:04.513
You forget when you were a punk
and those guys used to laugh at you.

11:04.644 --> 11:08.344
- Who used to whack them bums out?
- They laughed at both of us.

11:08.481 --> 11:10.888
No-one laughed at me.

11:11.025 --> 11:15.105
Tell me. Who fixed you up
with your first woman? Me, Paulie!

11:15.238 --> 11:20.612
- She was pregnant.
- So what? You was no prize either.

11:20.743 --> 11:23.151
You know, I always give ya. I give ya.

11:23.287 --> 11:27.071
What do you do?
You buy a new house. You move Mick in.

11:27.208 --> 11:31.122
Did you ask me?
Is there somethin' the matter with me?

11:31.796 --> 11:34.548
I got feelings. This ain't cardboard.

11:34.674 --> 11:36.713
Everybody's got 'em, Paulie.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.842
- The hell with everybody.
- Maybe it's the hell with you.

11:41.806 --> 11:46.302
- I don't wanna listen to this crap.
- You talk like everyone owes you a living.

11:46.435 --> 11:49.686
Nobody owes nobody nothin'.
You owe yourself.

11:49.814 --> 11:54.690
- You're wrong! Friends owe.
- No! Friends do because they wanna do.

11:54.819 --> 11:57.392
Shut your freakin' mouth.
You keep me down.

11:57.530 --> 12:02.904
Down? You're like a crazy brother
to me. You really are.

12:03.035 --> 12:07.282
So I wanna tell you somethin'.
This is comin' straight from the heart.

12:07.790 --> 12:11.159
You ain't down. And you ain't a loser.

12:11.669 --> 12:15.085
You're just a jealous, lazy bum.

12:16.424 --> 12:19.175
OK. I'm gonna break your mouth.

12:19.468 --> 12:21.710
I'm gonna bust your mouth up!

12:32.815 --> 12:35.520
Can I have a job?

12:37.653 --> 12:40.323
All you had to do was ask.

12:45.203 --> 12:47.741
- You punch pretty good.
- Think so?

12:47.872 --> 12:49.911
Oh, superb!

12:51.834 --> 12:54.835
- It cost a lot, huh?
- Yeah, a few bucks.

12:54.962 --> 12:57.251
Got an extra one?

12:59.842 --> 13:03.887
- Any trouble with Paulie tonight?
- Nah, nothin' unusual.

13:04.013 --> 13:06.586
Are you really gonna fight that wrestler?

13:06.724 --> 13:09.595
That's all right. It'll be fun.

13:09.727 --> 13:12.183
Mind if I serenade you awhile?

13:12.313 --> 13:14.934
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo... ~</i>
Come on, it's your part.

13:15.066 --> 13:17.473
- What are you doing?
- Come on, you can do it.

13:17.610 --> 13:19.567
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo ~</i>

13:19.695 --> 13:23.527
- Come on. You're gonna wake the baby.
- Adrian, let's do a duet.

13:23.658 --> 13:25.781
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo</i>

13:26.577 --> 13:28.819
<i>~ Doe doe doe-doe... ~</i>
- No, no.

13:28.955 --> 13:33.249
That's good, but it's not "doe doe".
It's <i>~ doo doo doo-doo ~</i>

13:34.085 --> 13:36.920
<i>~ Doo doo doe-doo... ~</i>
- That's good, darlin'.

13:37.046 --> 13:41.922
<i>~ I been told</i>
<i>Doo doo doo-doo... ~</i>

13:42.051 --> 13:46.796
<i>~ By people, and they all</i>
<i>Doo doo doo-doo... ~</i>

13:46.931 --> 13:51.593
<i>~ They said to take you back
Take you back like before ~</i>

13:55.106 --> 13:56.766
What's the matter?

13:56.899 --> 14:00.351
I don't know any more
of the composition.

14:00.486 --> 14:04.151
- Maybe we're lucky.
- Yeah, maybe we're very lucky.

14:05.658 --> 14:09.572
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo...</i>
<i>Hm hm mm-mm ~</i>

14:12.039 --> 14:16.536
<i>Howdy, sports fans. This is Dennis James</i>
<i>with Jim Healy down here at ringside.</i>

14:16.669 --> 14:20.667
Tonight we have a most unlikely match,
the boxer against the wrestler,

14:20.798 --> 14:23.254
with all the proceeds going to charity.

14:23.551 --> 14:26.256
What do you think about
a boxer against a wrestler?

14:26.387 --> 14:31.726
You know the theory. Once the wrestler
grabs the boxer, that's all she wrote.

14:31.851 --> 14:35.801
What the hell goes on inside your head?
Anything normal functions?

14:35.938 --> 14:38.346
- Yeah, there's a few.
- I don't think so.

14:38.482 --> 14:42.694
To fight a creature like this,
you gotta have 100lb of brain damage.

14:42.862 --> 14:47.239
I seen wrestlers that was bigger than
dinosaurs. You ever fight a dinosaur?

14:47.366 --> 14:51.660
- No, not lately.
- They can cause a variety of damage.

14:52.038 --> 14:54.659
The wrestling champion
of the world is here,

14:54.790 --> 14:58.076
and he is quite a sight,
all decked out in red.

14:58.628 --> 15:01.794
- Why are they carryin' him?
- He's walkin'.

15:07.970 --> 15:10.924
I'm comin' after you, Balboa.

15:11.057 --> 15:13.678
- Let's call it off.
- Aw, come on. It's for charity.

15:13.809 --> 15:18.222
You're wearin' your anatomy out.
Nobody else does this much for charity.

15:18.356 --> 15:21.310
- Bob Hope would.
- That's true.

15:27.073 --> 15:29.564
Rocky, you better call Bob Hope.

15:37.124 --> 15:40.458
To all my love slaves out there,

15:40.586 --> 15:44.251
Thunderlips is here in the flesh, baby.

15:44.799 --> 15:46.590
Oh, my God.

15:46.717 --> 15:51.759
The Ultimate Male,
versus the ultimate meatball.

15:53.182 --> 15:56.100
Boy, he is a monster!
How much would you take

15:56.227 --> 15:59.975
- even to get in the ring with him?
- Would you like to start at Fort Knox?

16:00.106 --> 16:03.973
In the white corner, an incredible sight.

16:04.735 --> 16:07.606
Standing nearly seven feet,

16:08.322 --> 16:11.193
weighing 390lb...

16:12.410 --> 16:15.411
- Large, ain't he?
...the undisputed wrestling champion...

16:15.538 --> 16:18.325
That's the biggest arm in the world!

16:19.167 --> 16:23.544
A man who calls himself
the ultimate object of desire,

16:24.630 --> 16:27.168
the mountain of molten lust,

16:27.300 --> 16:31.000
the one, the only - Thunderlips!

16:35.892 --> 16:40.767
You're all trash! You're all trash!
You're all trash!

16:44.108 --> 16:47.228
The slugger from Philadelphia...

16:48.779 --> 16:50.938
You better shut up.

16:51.782 --> 16:53.989
I'll break him in half!

16:54.118 --> 16:58.068
- How much do you think he eats?
- About 202lb.

16:58.206 --> 17:00.364
Weighing 202lb,

17:00.958 --> 17:06.249
the reigning heavyweight champion
of the world, Rocky Balboa.

17:13.387 --> 17:17.088
- Come to the centre of the ring.
- OK, come on, Mick.

17:24.898 --> 17:29.691
All right, you guys. This is for fun,
so take it easy and give 'em a good show.

17:31.280 --> 17:35.148
Listen, after the match, how about
we get a Polaroid together, OK?

17:35.827 --> 17:38.282
You're in trouble, buster.

17:39.497 --> 17:42.498
He got me mad!
I'm gonna break him in half like this!

17:43.709 --> 17:46.165
Lately, everybody wants to beat me up.

17:46.295 --> 17:48.667
This is entertainment. Fun and games.

17:48.798 --> 17:52.297
Stay awake, make faces.
Move around the ring.

17:52.426 --> 17:54.799
He is the ring.

17:56.055 --> 17:58.463
I get nervous every time he does that.

18:03.563 --> 18:07.145
Whoa! You move fast for a big guy.

18:07.275 --> 18:10.608
Why don't we just move around?
Give 'em a good show first.

18:10.736 --> 18:13.821
I'll chase you, and you chase me.
How's that? All right?

18:13.948 --> 18:17.115
I'll go easy. Here you go. Is that OK?

18:17.243 --> 18:19.401
Does that hurt? All right?

18:19.537 --> 18:21.743
How's that? OK? Not bad, huh?

18:24.750 --> 18:26.790
Come on, meatball.

18:31.090 --> 18:33.581
Think it's all fake, meatball?

18:33.718 --> 18:36.635
Thunderlips has gone absolutely berserk.

18:38.347 --> 18:42.392
- Run for your life.
- Life's tough, meatball!

18:49.692 --> 18:54.437
Get up, boy. Come on, meatball.
Get some of this right here.

18:58.868 --> 19:02.071
Rocko, remember the neighbourhood!

19:02.538 --> 19:04.246
Get out of his way!

19:04.373 --> 19:08.371
No, no. I'm not yet - not for the meatball.
I'm not throwing in yet, boy!

19:08.503 --> 19:13.663
If I can't break your spirit,
I sure enough can break your back.

19:15.134 --> 19:18.088
- Is Daddy having fun?
- Of course.

19:23.559 --> 19:26.596
Somebody get me a hatchet.

19:27.063 --> 19:32.021
- Holy smoke.
- Here we go, baby! Nice drop, meatball.

19:36.405 --> 19:39.110
Oh, my God. Balboa is really in pain.

19:39.242 --> 19:44.995
No one can believe the superhuman
strength of Thunderlips. I am the man!

19:45.122 --> 19:48.408
- Stop him, will ya?
- You want this punching bag?

19:48.543 --> 19:51.460
- Adrian!
- Rocky!

19:51.587 --> 19:53.496
Catch me!

19:53.631 --> 19:58.542
<i>Incredible! Balboa was just</i>
<i>heaved into the fifth row!</i>

19:58.678 --> 20:01.928
<i>Now the fans are outraged too!</i>

20:02.139 --> 20:05.722
He's got me mad! I'm gonna
drag him down like a dirty rag!

20:05.852 --> 20:08.603
You weakling, Balboa.

20:09.272 --> 20:12.059
Take it easy, take it easy.

20:12.692 --> 20:14.815
- Mickey, you OK?
- It's my heart.

20:14.944 --> 20:18.479
The security guards are rushing in,
trying to stop this slaughter.

20:18.614 --> 20:21.864
- Teeth are flying all around.
- Cut my gloves off.

20:23.578 --> 20:26.282
Cut my gloves off!

20:27.165 --> 20:30.498
The place is a zoo.
This place has turned into a zoo!

20:32.128 --> 20:34.583
You want me to get a doctor?
You're sure?

20:34.714 --> 20:39.126
The girls have gotten into it now.
They're getting beat up.

20:41.846 --> 20:44.847
- I'll be right back.
- You're a maniac! Come back here!

20:44.974 --> 20:48.058
- What are you doing?
- Come back here!

20:48.186 --> 20:52.931
- Come on!
- Out of the way, worms! I'm comin' up.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.686
Come on, come on!

21:02.533 --> 21:04.989
All right, Thunderlips. Break it up!

21:05.119 --> 21:07.741
No choking. No choking.

21:09.207 --> 21:11.448
Paulie, don't!

21:14.962 --> 21:17.002
I don't sweat you.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.261
Hang on there, kid.

21:28.267 --> 21:29.975
How d'you like it?

21:32.313 --> 21:34.685
I don't need this.

21:36.108 --> 21:41.483
Rocky hanging on like a bull terrier.
Now he's going for the stranglehold.

21:41.614 --> 21:44.022
Rocky! Rocky!

21:49.789 --> 21:51.912
The body!

21:56.212 --> 21:58.881
Knock his block off!

22:07.098 --> 22:09.137
No-o-o-o!

22:10.560 --> 22:13.763
It's unbelievable! Rocky actually did it!

22:13.896 --> 22:17.680
The human skyscraper is out of the ring!

22:17.817 --> 22:20.486
Right. That's it! Time is up.

22:23.865 --> 22:27.779
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw.

22:29.537 --> 22:32.372
Thank you for attending
the annual charity match

22:32.498 --> 22:35.285
between the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa,

22:35.418 --> 22:37.790
and Thunderlips, the Ultimate Male.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.246
See you next year. Thank God.

22:40.381 --> 22:42.504
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, pretty good.

22:42.884 --> 22:44.592
Good match.

22:44.719 --> 22:48.467
- Why'd you get so crazy on me out there?
- That's the name of the game.

22:48.598 --> 22:52.298
While you're still calm,
can we get that Polaroid together?

22:52.435 --> 22:55.436
- Yeah, sure.
- Adrian, come on over here.

22:55.563 --> 23:00.059
- My wife Adrian, my kid... Thunderlips.
- Ow! That hurt!

23:00.193 --> 23:02.315
That's all right.

23:02.445 --> 23:06.063
You know, sometimes charity really hurts.

23:09.577 --> 23:13.824
And Pinocchio told a lie, you see,
and his nose started growing real big.

23:13.956 --> 23:18.832
- Why didn't his ears grow?
- I don't know. I didn't write the story.

23:18.961 --> 23:22.876
- Are you fighting again?
- No, I don't plan on fighting today.

23:23.007 --> 23:26.043
- Promise?
- Promise. Definitely. I promise.

23:26.177 --> 23:29.012
- Good, I like you here.
- Yeah? I like being here.

23:29.138 --> 23:31.973
Are you gettin' hungry?
You want some breakfast?

23:32.099 --> 23:35.136
- Some Wheaties? What are Wheaties?
- Champions.

23:35.269 --> 23:38.354
Breakfast of what? Champions!

23:38.481 --> 23:41.731
<i>The father bear says</i>
<i>"Somebody's been sleepin' in my bed."</i>

23:41.859 --> 23:46.854
The little bear said "Somebody's been
sleepin' in my bed, and there she is."

23:46.989 --> 23:52.778
He pulls back the covers, exposing her
to the, you know, public. See?

23:52.912 --> 23:54.951
Eat your cereal before it sinks.

23:55.081 --> 23:58.865
- What happened to Goldilocks?
- I'm not exactly sure.

23:59.001 --> 24:03.213
- Busted for trespassing and got 30 days.
- That's real nice, Paulie.

24:05.049 --> 24:08.003
Rocky. Rocky, the car is waiting.

24:08.135 --> 24:11.089
- Go ahead. You guys better go.
- Be a good boy now.

24:11.222 --> 24:13.927
We'll have a fun time, me and the kid.

24:14.058 --> 24:16.976
Mrs Stallion, you almost look pretty good.

24:17.103 --> 24:19.345
Oh. Thank you, Paulie.

24:19.480 --> 24:24.641
Don't give the kid any beer.
And, Paulie, don't take him to the track.

24:24.777 --> 24:27.564
- How you doin', Mick?
- Pretty good.

24:29.073 --> 24:31.778
Now we got a problem in the seventh.

24:52.180 --> 24:56.426
Whatever happened to them
quiet, tender moments?

25:12.992 --> 25:15.032
Thank you. Thank you, one and all.

25:15.953 --> 25:20.200
Every once in a while, a person
comes along who defies the odds,

25:20.666 --> 25:26.420
who defies logic
and fulfils an incredible dream.

25:26.672 --> 25:29.876
On behalf of all
the citizens of Philadelphia

25:30.009 --> 25:32.761
and those touched
by your accomplishments

25:33.137 --> 25:37.929
and your untiring participation
in this city's many charity functions,

25:38.309 --> 25:41.559
it is with great honour
that we present this memorial,

25:41.938 --> 25:47.976
which will stand always as a celebration
to the indomitable spirit of man.

25:48.110 --> 25:51.942
Philadelphia salutes
its favourite son, Rocky Balboa!

26:04.377 --> 26:08.421
- It's beautiful.
- Definitely a thing of beauty.

26:08.798 --> 26:11.336
Rocky! Rocky!

26:23.729 --> 26:25.769
Thank you.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.400
Thank you very much.

26:35.992 --> 26:40.286
I don't know, what... what do you say
to something like this?

26:42.206 --> 26:45.160
About three years ago,

26:45.293 --> 26:50.453
this city really took me inside, you know?

26:53.426 --> 26:58.254
And I wanna thank you very much
for that. I really do.

26:59.056 --> 27:04.477
And I been thinking... I wasn't gonna
bring this up, but I might as well now.

27:05.062 --> 27:09.190
I would never do anything
to hurt this sport

27:09.317 --> 27:13.729
that has been so really good to me.

27:14.280 --> 27:18.906
I been talkin' it over
with my wife and my manager.

27:20.369 --> 27:22.742
We think that...

27:22.872 --> 27:27.083
It's really hard to do this. I feel like...

27:27.210 --> 27:30.994
I'm thinkin' maybe it's time that I should

27:31.130 --> 27:36.041
step down maybe and retire.

27:41.682 --> 27:45.762
Gettin' out while you can? Don't give
this sucker no statue. Give him guts!

27:45.895 --> 27:49.430
I told you I wasn't goin' away.
You got your shot. Now gimme mine.

27:49.565 --> 27:52.981
- Why don't you get the hell outta there?
- Shut up, old man!

27:53.110 --> 27:55.352
Tell these folks why you've ducked me.

27:55.488 --> 27:58.358
Politics, man!
This country wants to keep me down.

27:58.491 --> 28:03.034
They don't want a man like me to have
the title because I'm not a puppet like you.

28:03.162 --> 28:08.323
- You know, you've got a big mouth.
- Why don't you close it, Balboa?

28:08.459 --> 28:11.662
- Any time.
- The guy's crazy. Don't listen to him.

28:11.796 --> 28:15.247
The little man don't wanna come to me,
so I'll lay out the truth.

28:15.383 --> 28:18.384
I am ranked number one. One!
That means I'm the best.

28:18.511 --> 28:21.512
But this bum takes the easy matches,
fights other bums.

28:21.639 --> 28:26.680
I'm tellin' you and everybody here. I'll
fight him anywhere, any time, for nothin'.

28:29.605 --> 28:32.772
But you people ain't gonna see that,
cos he's gonna retire.

28:32.984 --> 28:36.435
You see, he don't fight no real man.
He fight them set-ups.

28:36.571 --> 28:39.026
- What?
- You're a disgrace to this sport.

28:39.157 --> 28:41.992
Shut up, old man!
You don't know where I came from.

28:42.118 --> 28:46.198
Balboa, your family doin' real nice.
You call yourself a fighter, prove it.

28:46.414 --> 28:50.079
Give me the same chance.
The way you been duckin' is a disgrace.

28:50.418 --> 28:52.825
If he ain't no coward,
why don't he fight me?

28:52.962 --> 28:56.331
- I can't listen to this...
- I don't care what you're ranked.

28:56.465 --> 29:01.626
- You don't get no shot, and I mean that!
- What are you doin'? I wanna fight him.

29:01.762 --> 29:04.929
Well, you got him.
But you fight him without me.

29:05.933 --> 29:09.978
- What are you sayin'?
- It's finished. I don't want no more of this.

29:10.104 --> 29:13.555
I don't want no more of it.
You understand? None of it!

29:13.858 --> 29:16.610
It's over with!

29:16.736 --> 29:19.856
Hey, woman! Hey, woman. Listen here.

29:19.989 --> 29:23.572
Since your old man ain't got no heart,
maybe you wanna see a real man?

29:23.701 --> 29:26.951
I bet you stay up every night
dreaming you had a real man, huh?

29:27.079 --> 29:32.370
Bring your pretty little self over to my
apartment and I'll show you a real man.

29:32.502 --> 29:34.790
You want it, you got it! You got it, man!

29:39.175 --> 29:41.500
I'll see you in the ring! You got it!

29:48.142 --> 29:51.558
Rocky, don't! Come on.
Rocky, please. Let's go talk.

29:51.687 --> 29:53.846
OK, Adrian.

29:53.981 --> 29:56.437
Rocky! Let's talk.

30:01.322 --> 30:03.860
Why'd you leave?
Why'd you walk away like that?

30:03.991 --> 30:06.696
Life's too short, kid.

30:06.828 --> 30:11.620
- Where you goin'?
- I'm goin' on a permanent vacation.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.538
What do you mean?
We got one more fight.

30:14.669 --> 30:17.753
No, no. Not "we". You.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.788
Why are you doin' this?

30:24.971 --> 30:28.671
- I said, why you doin' this?
- Because you can't win, Rock.

30:28.808 --> 30:31.928
This guy'll kill you to death
inside of three rounds.

30:32.061 --> 30:34.386
- You're crazy.
- What else is new?

30:34.522 --> 30:37.725
- He's just another fighter.
- No, he ain't.

30:37.859 --> 30:40.147
This guy is a wreckin' machine.

30:40.278 --> 30:44.275
And he's hungry. You ain't been
hungry since you won that belt.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.491
- What? I had ten title defences.
- That was easy.

30:47.618 --> 30:51.402
- What do you mean, easy?
- They was hand-picked!

30:53.875 --> 30:56.544
- Set-ups?
- No, they weren't set-ups!

30:56.669 --> 31:00.453
They was good fighters.
But they wasn't killers, like this guy.

31:00.590 --> 31:03.460
He'll knock ya into tomorrow, Rock.

31:22.862 --> 31:25.151
Jeez, Mick.

31:26.741 --> 31:28.864
Why'd you do it?

31:30.870 --> 31:36.659
Because the beating that you got from
Apollo shoulda killed you, kid. It didn't.

31:36.792 --> 31:41.953
It was my job to keep you winning,
and to keep you healthy.

31:47.094 --> 31:50.261
You really don't think
I got nothin' left, do you?

31:51.098 --> 31:54.966
Well, Rock, let's... let's put it this way.

31:56.312 --> 31:59.562
Now, three years ago,
you was supernatural.

32:00.483 --> 32:04.694
You was...
You was hard, and you was nasty

32:04.820 --> 32:07.276
and you had this cast-iron jaw.

32:08.032 --> 32:14.236
But then, the worst thing happened to you
that could happen to any fighter.

32:15.623 --> 32:17.948
You got civilised.

32:23.422 --> 32:25.415
But don't worry, kid.

32:25.550 --> 32:32.133
You know, presidents retire,
generals retire, horses retire.

32:32.265 --> 32:36.345
Man o' War retired.
They put him out to stud.

32:37.687 --> 32:40.688
That's what you shoulda done - retire.

32:44.277 --> 32:47.194
I can't retire knowin' all this, Mick.

32:47.321 --> 32:50.239
- Aw, don't push it.
- You been carrying me.

32:50.366 --> 32:53.984
- We don't need it.
- You been carrying me, though.

32:54.120 --> 32:57.370
I haven't been carryin' you,
I've been protectin' ya.

32:57.498 --> 33:00.618
No, I want this fight. Just one more.

33:00.751 --> 33:03.955
- No, we don't need it.
- I'll live in the gym.

33:04.088 --> 33:06.579
- We don't need it.
- Mick, I do.

33:07.967 --> 33:12.214
- I'm askin' you to train me one last time.
- No, no. I can't.

33:12.346 --> 33:14.588
If you don't,

33:14.724 --> 33:19.966
I'm gonna tell everybody you ain't
bought new underwear in ten years.

33:20.104 --> 33:23.888
- You would, wouldn't ya?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

33:26.319 --> 33:28.062
No, no.

33:28.196 --> 33:30.235
Come on.

33:31.199 --> 33:35.410
One more time - it's over. It's a deal?

33:35.536 --> 33:39.368
- Go on, go on.
- It's your head, kid. It's your head.

33:42.543 --> 33:45.580
Yeah, it is. Thanks, man.

33:47.215 --> 33:50.671
<i>~ Pushin', gettin' ready for the fight ~</i>

Collectors' item! Get your buttons here!

34:40.976 --> 34:45.971
You can't stand toe to toe with
this guy or he'll deposit you up on Mars.

34:46.107 --> 34:48.942
He's too tough. He's too strong.

34:50.235 --> 34:54.649
Listen, how the hell can we
train in this creep joint here?

34:54.782 --> 34:57.949
This is kind of a house of ill repute,
or somethin', is it?

34:58.161 --> 35:02.490
- Why did you rent this joint?
- Aw, come on. Let's go out in style.

35:02.748 --> 35:05.239
You wanna go out in style,
go out in one piece.

35:05.376 --> 35:08.496
Now, come on, let's get outta here,
back to the old gym.

35:08.629 --> 35:11.381
Let's get some blood
and sweat and tears around here.

35:11.507 --> 35:15.635
- Can we do that?
- Hey, will you just relax and enjoy it, OK?

35:19.807 --> 35:21.634
They love it, Mick.

35:28.941 --> 35:32.275
Go on, fight.
Fight now, go ahead. Fight it, fight it.

35:32.403 --> 35:35.689
Get rough. Get tough. Get brutal. That's it.

35:35.823 --> 35:38.030
Excuse me. Can I get a kiss?

35:38.159 --> 35:41.029
- Yeah, sure.
- Get outta here, will ya?

35:41.162 --> 35:44.613
This is like fightin' in a zoo.

35:44.749 --> 35:50.538
Is that the way you train for Clubber?
He ain't gonna kiss ya. He's gonna kill ya.

35:50.671 --> 35:52.711
Get outta here!

35:56.636 --> 36:00.550
- Hey, Rock. How about a picture?
- Yeah, sure.

36:56.153 --> 36:59.854
This'll tell us a story.
That's it, side to side.

36:59.991 --> 37:02.030
Side to side, Rock.

37:02.910 --> 37:06.362
Shut up back there, can't you?
Change your tune.

37:06.497 --> 37:10.709
That's it. Pull front punches. That's it, kid.
You're a deadly weapon.

37:10.835 --> 37:14.334
Time! Time, time, time. Quit it.

37:14.463 --> 37:16.503
You're OK. Come on.

37:17.550 --> 37:21.630
Put this on before you catch pneumonia.
I'll give you a rubdown too.

37:21.762 --> 37:27.349
Listen, I don't like to hear much
of what comes out of people's mouths,

37:27.476 --> 37:30.050
and I don't like soft-talkin' moments.

37:30.188 --> 37:33.603
- That's for sure.
- But I just wanna tell ya one thing.

37:33.733 --> 37:37.777
- That I'm proud of ya.
- Well, thanks a lot.

37:37.904 --> 37:40.477
That's all right, kid. Let's get outta here.

37:40.615 --> 37:44.149
Hey, Mick. What do you think
we're gonna do when it's all over?

37:44.285 --> 37:46.693
I don't know. Maybe join up with a circus.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.869
Yeah, maybe.

37:48.998 --> 37:51.323
All right, let's get out.

37:57.173 --> 37:59.746
Good evening.
With Bill Baldwin, I'm Stu Nahan.

37:59.884 --> 38:04.842
Welcome to this heavyweight title fight,
which may be the most memorable of all.

38:04.972 --> 38:09.100
Tonight is the champion's final
and perhaps most difficult defence.

38:09.227 --> 38:13.011
- Rocky, are you in your best shape?
- Absolutely. I feel real good.

38:13.272 --> 38:16.522
He's a deadly weapon.
He's one of a kind and he's gonna do it.

38:16.651 --> 38:20.898
- Clubber, are you as fast as Balboa?
- No talkin'. I do my talkin' in the ring.

38:23.449 --> 38:26.367
I told you, you better get outta here.
I wanna be alone.

38:26.494 --> 38:30.657
- Will you retire after this fight?
- Yeah. This is the last one for sure.

38:30.790 --> 38:33.079
This is definitely the last one.

38:33.793 --> 38:36.248
You're parasites and leeches.
Get outta here.

38:36.379 --> 38:39.249
What will you do after tonight?

38:39.382 --> 38:41.421
I'm not sure.

38:41.551 --> 38:45.383
- Maybe join the circus. Huh, Mick?
- Yeah, have some fun.

38:45.513 --> 38:49.380
- Come on, take your robe off.
- Take off your robe!

38:49.517 --> 38:51.842
I told you to get outta my face!

38:51.978 --> 38:56.189
With us is the former heavyweight
champion of the world, Apollo Creed.

38:56.315 --> 38:59.980
Do you have any predictions on this fight?
How do you see it going?

39:00.111 --> 39:02.780
Strength would have
to go to the challenger,

39:02.905 --> 39:07.733
while experience and the world's
hardest head would have to go to Balboa.

39:08.161 --> 39:12.869
Remember, Rock, don't trade with this
guy. Take your time. Wear him down.

39:12.999 --> 39:18.539
But don't stand toe to toe.
This punk's never been 15 rounds before.

39:18.671 --> 39:21.755
- Take him good.
- OK. I will.

39:23.759 --> 39:28.884
- I predict the champ's gonna take it.
- Do you really think he can hit that hard?

39:29.015 --> 39:31.684
Why do you think I'm here with you?

39:49.076 --> 39:53.785
Hey, sucker! You're finished!
You're through! You're washed up!

39:53.915 --> 39:56.156
- I'm the baddest in the world!
- Not to me.

39:56.542 --> 39:59.828
What you say, paper champion?
I'm gonna beat you like a dog.

39:59.962 --> 40:02.085
Get that ape back in the ring.

40:02.215 --> 40:06.212
- You made me wait too long! You'll pay!
- Come on, mouth.

40:06.552 --> 40:09.008
Get him outta there!

40:18.147 --> 40:21.314
Do you know who I am? I'm the man!

40:23.069 --> 40:28.443
- I'll get you, sucker! You're dead meat!
- Let me go!

40:28.574 --> 40:32.109
Rocky! Rocky!

40:32.954 --> 40:35.658
- What's wrong?
- It's his heart.

40:35.790 --> 40:39.325
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor! Come on!

40:46.342 --> 40:48.915
Get 'em outta here!

40:49.053 --> 40:51.805
- Mick, will you sit on the table?
- I'm all right.

40:51.931 --> 40:55.181
Take a deep breath.
Get those guys outta here! Move!

40:56.310 --> 40:59.644
Paulie, tell 'em the fight's off.
Go on. Go on!

40:59.772 --> 41:03.058
The fight's not off.
Are you outta your mind? The fight's on.

41:03.192 --> 41:06.644
- Mick, we can't tonight. I ain't fightin'.
- We're gonna fight.

41:06.779 --> 41:10.029
Just let me get my breath.
Is that against the rules?

41:10.783 --> 41:13.784
- Will you please get a doctor?
- He's on his way.

41:13.911 --> 41:16.865
Mick, I can't go out and fight like this.

41:16.998 --> 41:22.205
Get outta there. Get goin', will ya? Take
him. Take him good - get it over with.

41:25.590 --> 41:27.878
Adrian, what am I supposed to do?

41:28.009 --> 41:33.299
What do ya mean? After all these years
together, you don't know what to do?

41:33.431 --> 41:37.131
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Now get out there and do it.

41:38.394 --> 41:40.434
Do it.

41:41.189 --> 41:43.098
Do it.

41:43.232 --> 41:47.312
- You're the best.
- OK. OK.

41:47.445 --> 41:50.114
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

41:50.239 --> 41:52.446
Oh, my God.

41:55.828 --> 41:58.995
Adrian, take care of him.
Take care of him.

42:03.961 --> 42:06.203
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:06.339 --> 42:11.546
welcome to the heavyweight
championship of the world.

42:11.677 --> 42:16.256
And fans, with us tonight,
truly one of the fistic greats.

42:16.432 --> 42:22.221
He's coming up from ringside,
the Master of Disaster, the King of Sting,

42:22.355 --> 42:25.521
the one and only Apollo Creed.

42:26.984 --> 42:30.400
There's the former heavyweight
champion, Apollo Creed.

42:30.530 --> 42:32.818
He looks like $9 million.

42:33.282 --> 42:38.656
Get outta my face! I don't need
no has-been messin' in my corner.

42:38.788 --> 42:41.623
Get that bad look off your face
before I knock it off!

42:41.749 --> 42:46.162
Come on. Wanna jump me? Jump!
Come on. Come on, Creed.

42:46.629 --> 42:49.915
Come on. Yeah, come on.

42:50.049 --> 42:53.584
Yeah. Just like a chicken. You better run.

42:57.056 --> 43:02.347
Give everybody a present and drop this
chump, all right? Good luck to you, man.

43:07.066 --> 43:11.562
All right, fans, here we go.
On my left, out of the blue corner,

43:11.696 --> 43:16.737
hailing from Chicago,
weighing in at an even 235lb,

43:17.034 --> 43:19.952
the world's No.1 challenger...

43:20.079 --> 43:23.199
- Wonder how Mick's doin'.
...Clubber Lang.

43:25.960 --> 43:28.036
I'm the best! I'm the best!

43:28.713 --> 43:31.464
You and Clubber exchanged words.
Any comment?

43:31.591 --> 43:32.705
No comment.

43:32.842 --> 43:39.011
His opponent in the opposite corner,
really needing no introduction,

43:39.140 --> 43:42.840
he weighs in at a trim 201 lb.

43:42.977 --> 43:47.438
The pride of Philadelphia,
the Italian Stallion,

43:47.565 --> 43:54.612
and the reigning heavyweight champion
of the world, Rocky Balboa.

43:58.659 --> 44:00.866
Listen to this crowd.

44:06.459 --> 44:11.666
Now to give instructions in the middle
of the ring, your referee, Marty Denkin.

44:13.716 --> 44:16.670
Clubber, Rocky. I want a good, clean fight.

44:16.802 --> 44:19.673
When I tell you to break,
step back and break.

44:19.805 --> 44:23.803
Now go back to the corner
and come out fighting at the bell.

44:24.268 --> 44:27.269
Dead meat.

44:31.234 --> 44:33.772
This is not gonna be a fight of finesse.

44:33.903 --> 44:37.070
These are two guys
that really throw punches.

44:37.198 --> 44:40.234
- The chump is scared.
- Yeah. Tear him up, champ.

44:40.368 --> 44:42.906
He's scared. See the look in his eyes?

44:44.163 --> 44:48.078
I'm no trainer. Just go out
and kill the guy. Kill him, Rock.

44:49.168 --> 44:51.706
He's scared.

44:51.838 --> 44:55.171
I'm the new champion!
I'm the new champ as of tonight.

44:55.299 --> 45:00.175
...Italian Stallion, a rugged champion,
in the final fight of his colourful career.

45:04.976 --> 45:08.594
Here we go. Oh boy,
the champion came out swinging.

45:10.356 --> 45:14.899
Balboa's off to an incredible start,
determined to destroy the challenger.

45:19.949 --> 45:22.107
Move him back! Move him back!

45:26.289 --> 45:28.328
Defence.

45:30.001 --> 45:32.752
They're goin' at each other.

45:34.172 --> 45:36.460
You got him.

45:36.591 --> 45:38.963
Double up! Double up!

45:40.845 --> 45:44.712
Come on! Come on now, boy! Come on.

45:46.726 --> 45:49.976
The challenger is hitting him
with everything he's got.

45:54.483 --> 45:56.939
Come on, Balboa. Make me weak!

45:57.528 --> 46:00.066
Come on, Balboa. Come on, weakling.

46:06.370 --> 46:09.822
Clubber away.
Trying to get him to his corner.

46:09.957 --> 46:12.033
Grab him, Paulie.

46:12.919 --> 46:15.291
- Where's Mick? Where's Mick?
- He's OK.

46:15.421 --> 46:17.165
I need him.

46:17.340 --> 46:19.961
He ain't nothin'! I told you he ain't nothin'.

46:20.092 --> 46:23.711
- He's too strong.
- Don't talk like that, Rock.

46:23.846 --> 46:26.598
I'm gonna smoke him.
I'm gonna smoke him.

46:27.058 --> 46:29.300
I can't keep him off.

46:29.852 --> 46:32.343
He's mine! I'm gonna get him!

46:32.939 --> 46:35.015
I'm losin' it, Paulie.

46:37.151 --> 46:39.025
- What have you got?
- 200 over 50.

46:39.153 --> 46:41.312
All right, let's start CPR.

46:42.406 --> 46:44.897
- Rock, you can do it.
- I'll try.

46:45.034 --> 46:48.818
Round two.
Rocky appears to be staggering.

46:48.955 --> 46:53.284
- Yeah, I'll get him.
- Out of the corner, here comes Clubber!

46:56.295 --> 46:59.960
Come on, Balboa, come on. Give it to me.

47:04.011 --> 47:06.218
Move on the inside.

47:07.139 --> 47:10.971
The champion is nearly helpless.
Gosh, what a beating he's taking.

47:16.566 --> 47:19.650
Don't stand toe to toe with him.

47:38.421 --> 47:42.465
- Man, get up.
- Get up! Get up!

47:42.592 --> 47:45.213
I told you I'm gonna get you.
Come on, get up!

47:45.344 --> 47:48.345
Seven, eight, nine,

47:48.681 --> 47:50.555
ten. You're out.

47:51.017 --> 47:53.804
The champion is finished
in the second round!

47:53.936 --> 47:57.139
It's unbelievable. Incredible upset.

47:57.273 --> 48:01.021
Balboa, in the corner,
is out on his feet, out of the fight.

48:06.157 --> 48:08.280
We have the time.

48:08.409 --> 48:13.652
The winner by knockout, the new
heavyweight champion of the world,

48:13.789 --> 48:16.494
Clubber Lang!

48:16.626 --> 48:19.295
I told you! I told you I'd do it!

48:21.297 --> 48:24.500
I'm the new champion of the world!

48:31.891 --> 48:33.930
Come on, get outta here!

48:39.357 --> 48:41.812
- What happened?
- I'm all right. How's Mick?

48:41.943 --> 48:44.101
He wouldn't go to the hospital.

48:44.237 --> 48:47.771
Mr Balboa, we must get him
to hospital immediately.

48:47.907 --> 48:49.531
OK.

49:02.880 --> 49:05.798
- Mick?
- What?

49:05.925 --> 49:11.844
- Mick?
- Wh... what? Wh-wh-what?

49:11.973 --> 49:16.267
- Is it over?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's all over.

49:17.395 --> 49:21.227
Hey, listen. What happened?

49:22.066 --> 49:24.438
It was a knockout.

49:25.528 --> 49:29.193
- What round? What round?
- Second round.

49:32.368 --> 49:35.155
Yeah, I knew it. That's good.

49:35.288 --> 49:38.870
- We did it, huh?
- We did it. We did it.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.827
You don't have to worry about nothin'
no more. Everything's gonna be OK, Mick.

49:43.963 --> 49:48.210
- Yeah. Rocky, we did it.
- You gotta get to hospital.

49:49.010 --> 49:51.133
You ain't as young as you used to be, OK?

49:51.262 --> 49:53.587
You know what?

49:53.723 --> 49:56.926
We did everything right.
I did everything right?

49:57.059 --> 49:59.218
Listen, you done everything right.

49:59.353 --> 50:04.430
Listen, we got more to do. Mick,
whatever you wanna do, we'll do it, OK?

50:05.067 --> 50:07.356
I love ya, kid. I love ya.

50:08.821 --> 50:10.861
Mick.

50:10.990 --> 50:13.030
It hurts me.

50:15.077 --> 50:17.070
Mick?

50:20.708 --> 50:22.748
Mick!

50:30.551 --> 50:32.591
Mick!

50:35.765 --> 50:38.516
Mick... Christ.

50:52.949 --> 50:55.903
Don't go away. Please don't.

50:56.035 --> 51:01.456
We got more to do...
We got more to do. We got...

51:03.334 --> 51:08.541
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

52:07.106 --> 52:09.395
This concludes our service.

55:03.866 --> 55:06.238
That's not the way to do it.

55:06.369 --> 55:08.361
Who's that?

55:09.038 --> 55:12.324
Why don't you hit it straight? Step into it.

55:14.335 --> 55:17.419
- Apollo?
- Right.

55:17.547 --> 55:21.924
I waited at your house for an hour.
Your wife said you might be here.

55:22.051 --> 55:25.467
- What are you doin' here?
- Business.

55:27.056 --> 55:32.892
If the papers knew we were talkin' like
this, they'd think we was crazy. Why you?

55:33.020 --> 55:36.187
Cos I'm the best and you need
somebody to teach you different.

55:36.315 --> 55:40.728
- Why?
- You can't pull it off without me.

55:40.862 --> 55:44.313
You still didn't give me the answer.
What's the real reason?

55:45.533 --> 55:47.988
Listen. It's quiet, isn't it?

55:49.245 --> 55:51.783
When you retire, it's too quiet.

55:51.914 --> 55:54.037
We too young to retire, anyway.

55:54.167 --> 56:00.287
Besides, I could promote this thing into
the biggest gate ever. Bigger than ours.

56:00.590 --> 56:05.133
Heaven knows, I don't mind being
involved with large numbers, right?

56:06.512 --> 56:10.592
I don't need this no more.
I... I don't want this no more.

56:11.893 --> 56:15.178
Look, man. When you beat me,

56:16.105 --> 56:20.814
I hurt all over. I didn't wanna know
from nobody, not even my kids.

56:21.611 --> 56:23.650
Every fighter knows that hurt.

56:23.779 --> 56:27.030
We get sick inside trying to live with it,
so don't back off now.

56:27.158 --> 56:30.823
Make it right for yourself
or you'll be sorry you didn't.

56:30.953 --> 56:35.033
We held the greatest title
in the whole world, babe.

56:36.209 --> 56:40.621
You lost that fight for all
the wrong reasons. You lost your edge.

56:41.422 --> 56:46.582
All right. I know your manager dying
had you all messed up inside.

56:47.345 --> 56:50.299
But the truth is you didn't look hungry.

56:50.431 --> 56:52.637
Now when we fought,

56:53.518 --> 56:56.435
you had that eye of the tiger,
man, the edge.

56:56.604 --> 57:01.811
Now you gotta get it back, and the way
to do it is to go back to the beginning.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.995
Maybe we could win it back together.

57:08.050 --> 57:10.505
Eye of the tiger, man.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.803
Why'd you have to come here?

57:16.850 --> 57:20.301
I have the plan. Get back, man.

57:22.189 --> 57:24.312
You got me curious.

57:26.109 --> 57:28.435
You got me curious, Rock.

57:32.991 --> 57:36.906
<i>Clubber, do you accept the challenge</i>
<i>for a rematch with Balboa?</i>

57:37.037 --> 57:40.370
<i>I reject the challenge</i>
<i>because Balboa is no challenge.</i>

57:40.499 --> 57:44.627
<i>But I'd be happy to beat up on him</i>
<i>some more. I always said he was nothin'.</i>

57:44.753 --> 57:46.793
I can't wait to see this bum fall.

57:46.922 --> 57:49.876
<i>What do you think of him</i>
<i>being trained by Apollo Creed?</i>

57:50.008 --> 57:53.258
<i>Apollo who? That old fool Apollo Creed?</i>

57:53.387 --> 57:56.969
<i>- Shucks. One has-been...</i>
- Just keep talkin', pal.

57:57.099 --> 58:00.598
<i>Been runnin' off at the mouth.</i>
<i>When I see him, I'm gonna close it.</i>

58:00.727 --> 58:04.642
<i>- When will the match take place?</i>
<i>- The sooner, the better.</i>

58:04.773 --> 58:09.684
<i>I'm the champion of the world.</i>
<i>I can't be beat and I won't be beat.</i>

58:09.820 --> 58:13.355
<i>This time I'll train harder.</i>
<i>There won't be no quick knockdowns.</i>

58:13.490 --> 58:16.906
<i>I'm gonna torture him.</i>
<i>I'm gonna crucify him - real bad.</i>

58:17.035 --> 58:19.158
<i>Hard words from a hard man.</i>

58:19.288 --> 58:24.958
<i>The odds against Balboa making</i>
<i>a comeback at 34 are very long indeed.</i>

58:25.085 --> 58:28.335
<i>Can he do it? Most experts doubt it.</i>

58:28.463 --> 58:33.754
<i>Balboa was a fine champion,</i>
<i>but his time has passed. I wish him luck.</i>

58:34.920 --> 58:39.381
- Don't listen to it, Rocky.
- No, do listen to it, Rock.

58:39.508 --> 58:44.134
When this is over, a lot of folks are
gonna owe you an engraved apology.

58:45.472 --> 58:49.470
- And you're gonna owe me a big favour.
- What favour?

58:49.601 --> 58:51.890
When it's over. Hm?

58:56.817 --> 59:01.894
Rocko, come on! We're gonna
be late at the airport. Let's go!

59:02.030 --> 59:05.565
- Think we forgot anything?
- I think we have it all.

59:05.701 --> 59:09.745
- Maybe another sweater.
- No. California's not that cold, is it?

59:09.871 --> 59:13.287
OK, listen.
I want you to be a good boy, OK?

59:13.417 --> 59:15.789
- Don't give anybody a hard time.
- OK.

59:16.587 --> 59:18.793
Gimme a kiss.

59:25.556 --> 59:28.080
- We'll call when we land.
- Yeah, we'll call.

59:52.174 --> 59:54.176
<i>~ I been told by ~</i>

59:55.729 --> 59:58.813
<i>~ Some people, and they all ~</i>

59:59.399 --> 01:00:01.641
<i>~ Say to take you back ~</i>

01:00:03.945 --> 01:00:06.780
<i>~ Take you back like before ~</i>

01:00:07.991 --> 01:00:11.241
<i>~ I don't call that a reason ~</i>

01:00:12.245 --> 01:00:17.915
<i>~ I just call it believin' in myself ~</i>

01:00:18.668 --> 01:00:21.040
<i>~ Believin' in myself ~</i>

01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:26.333
- What the hell are we doin' in LA?
- This is where I started.

01:00:26.468 --> 01:00:28.793
- So?
- So this is where he's startin'.

01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:31.633
This place is disgusting.
Let's stay at your place.

01:00:31.765 --> 01:00:35.430
You're missin' the point.
Let's check in and get over to the gym.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.854
Rock, we don't need this.
It's below your standards.

01:00:39.981 --> 01:00:43.148
We gotta give it a try, Paulie.
Come on, Adrian.

01:00:52.202 --> 01:00:54.491
<i>~ I don't call that a reason ~</i>

01:00:54.621 --> 01:00:56.578
I don't even have a gun.

01:00:56.706 --> 01:01:01.119
<i>~ I just call it believin' in myself ~</i>

01:01:02.629 --> 01:01:03.954
<i>~ Believin' in myself... ~</i>

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:07.748
Fun is fun. I like those kind of things,
but this, I don't like.

01:01:07.884 --> 01:01:13.341
Look at this place. Rats even have
more pride than to be caught dead here.

01:01:13.473 --> 01:01:16.924
I mean, look at the dump.
I just don't like it.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.977
- Think of Adrian's health.
- I'm fine, Paulie.

01:01:36.454 --> 01:01:38.661
Check this out.

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:49.925
Yeah. Yeah...

01:01:51.303 --> 01:01:55.550
- This is where I started.
- That's your problem.

01:01:55.682 --> 01:01:59.015
Rocko,
let's leave before they leave us for dead.

01:02:00.979 --> 01:02:05.024
Yeah.
You see that look in their eyes, Rock?

01:02:05.358 --> 01:02:08.525
When we fought, I trained hard
but I didn't have that look.

01:02:08.653 --> 01:02:10.776
You had it and you won.

01:02:12.407 --> 01:02:14.447
Gotta get that look back, Rock.

01:02:14.826 --> 01:02:18.112
Eye of the tiger, man.
Eye of the tiger. Come on.

01:02:18.246 --> 01:02:20.239
Come on, let's go.

01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:23.244
Look at this place. No class in here.

01:02:23.376 --> 01:02:25.950
- Is he always so cheerful?
- I don't sweat you.

01:02:26.087 --> 01:02:29.670
- Hey, Paulie. Don't get mentally irregular.
- It's a free country.

01:02:29.799 --> 01:02:34.011
- Just don't get irregular.
- I don't need no philosophy lesson.

01:02:34.137 --> 01:02:38.550
- It takes six years to get to know him.
- I ain't got six years.

01:02:38.683 --> 01:02:41.055
Come on, Paulie, just relax. Come on.

01:02:42.395 --> 01:02:44.435
We're on business.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.850
- Hey! Hey, champ!
- Hey, Duke, my man!

01:02:50.987 --> 01:02:54.237
- Hey, everything's set up.
- Good. I know you know this man.

01:02:54.366 --> 01:02:57.948
Yeah. It's gonna be good workin'
with you and not against you.

01:02:58.078 --> 01:02:59.821
- How you feel?
- Pretty good, thanks.

01:02:59.955 --> 01:03:02.742
We've been livin' modern.
Now we're gonna train old.

01:03:02.874 --> 01:03:04.950
I'm goin' over here to talk to the guys.

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:07.124
Hey! The champ is home.

01:03:09.506 --> 01:03:13.504
- We gotta leave. I got a reputation.
- What do you mean, reputation?

01:03:13.635 --> 01:03:17.253
- You heard. I don't like these people.
- You don't like 'em?

01:03:19.307 --> 01:03:22.142
Well, maybe they don't
like you either, Paulie.

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:25.020
What'd I do to them?

01:03:25.146 --> 01:03:27.186
And they call me punchy.

01:03:27.315 --> 01:03:31.894
- Stallion. Come over and meet the fellas.
- I'll be right back.

01:03:32.028 --> 01:03:34.068
How you doin', guys?

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:47.870
That's it, that's it.
Come on, on the toes. On the toes!

01:03:48.003 --> 01:03:51.835
On the toes. On the toes. On the toes.

01:03:53.383 --> 01:03:55.423
Come on, Rock.

01:03:55.552 --> 01:03:59.502
- He ain't too graceful.
- That's why we're here, Paulie.

01:03:59.723 --> 01:04:02.392
Waste of time. He's got heavy feet.

01:04:02.517 --> 01:04:05.518
Get on the balls of your feet.
Come on, relax, Rock.

01:04:06.021 --> 01:04:10.065
- Come on, get those feet outta concrete.
- It'll take time but it'll come.

01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:13.395
He can't train to the jungle junk music.

01:04:14.112 --> 01:04:18.608
Come on, relax, Rock.
On the balls of your feet. Find the rhythm.

01:04:18.742 --> 01:04:21.315
We'll start a new dance called the crawl.

01:04:21.453 --> 01:04:25.700
You can't train him like a coloured fighter.
He ain't got no rhythm.

01:04:25.999 --> 01:04:26.999
Come on.

01:04:27.125 --> 01:04:29.248
- How stupid do I look!
- You look great.

01:04:29.461 --> 01:04:31.952
Everything we do works out the jab.
Good.

01:04:35.342 --> 01:04:38.545
- Can he swim?
- With a name like Rock?

01:04:38.678 --> 01:04:42.462
No time to waste. Let's go!
Another lap. Move it.

01:04:42.599 --> 01:04:46.383
- Another lap.
- He ain't no tuna. We belong in the gym.

01:04:46.519 --> 01:04:48.595
He's usin' muscles he never knew he had.

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:53.107
Come on, Rock. Stretch now.
Move it, Rock. Move it.

01:04:53.318 --> 01:04:56.734
Nobody can change that much.
He's a bruiser. He ain't no boxer.

01:04:56.863 --> 01:05:00.149
You keep tellin' him that
and he'll be nothin'.

01:05:00.283 --> 01:05:03.783
Another lap. Come on now!
Move it. Move it!

01:05:03.912 --> 01:05:07.660
Come on. Move it, Rock.
Come on! Let's go. Let's go.

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:09.910
That's it, stretch it out.

01:05:10.043 --> 01:05:13.044
That's it. You gotta pull. Hard, now. Hard.

01:05:21.137 --> 01:05:24.637
Shut up, ya Sterno bums! I'll squash ya.

01:05:24.766 --> 01:05:27.008
There's decent people tryin' to sleep!

01:05:27.143 --> 01:05:29.895
Shut up, you honky scum bastard mother!

01:05:30.021 --> 01:05:33.473
Who needs this sick place? I don't.

01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:37.274
No class.

01:05:40.323 --> 01:05:42.649
Damn, that Clubber's strong.

01:05:42.784 --> 01:05:45.868
15 rounds is a long time.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.619
We gotta put him away early.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:55.161
I figure with the pace we gotta set, Rock
can last maybe seven or eight rounds.

01:05:56.631 --> 01:05:59.003
Then we'll be out of steam, man.

01:05:59.551 --> 01:06:01.793
We got to put him away early.

01:06:05.473 --> 01:06:08.427
At least the water's hot.

01:06:10.562 --> 01:06:13.017
Well, we never really had a honeymoon.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.440
It's not so bad.

01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:22.240
You've been in worse places.

01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:25.274
<i>Rocky's in trouble in round two.</i>

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:29.075
<i>He takes a right.</i>
<i>He's been cut! Rocky's been cut!</i>

01:06:30.999 --> 01:06:33.038
Come on, Rock. Come on, now.

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.536
Let's go. You gotta get tougher.

01:06:36.671 --> 01:06:39.708
Think smooth. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

01:06:40.342 --> 01:06:43.675
On your toes, Rock.
On your toes. On your toes!

01:06:44.971 --> 01:06:47.343
Push yourself, Rock! Concentrate.

01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:51.466
Let's move it, Rock.
Move it now. Come on!

01:06:51.603 --> 01:06:53.761
Have fun with it.

01:06:53.897 --> 01:06:56.566
That's it. Easy, easy, easy.

01:06:59.194 --> 01:07:01.352
Don't push it. Let it come.

01:07:01.488 --> 01:07:05.236
It'll come. It just takes time, baby.

01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:08.825
Move your head, move your head.
Up and down.

01:07:08.954 --> 01:07:11.361
Come on, come on.

01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:15.116
In and out. Inside. Inside. Inside, baby.

01:07:15.669 --> 01:07:20.129
- Side to side. Move your head.
- Watch him. He's got two hands, right?

01:07:25.011 --> 01:07:29.969
Damn, man! What the hell are you doin'?
This guy will knock you on your ass!

01:07:31.685 --> 01:07:33.843
Come on, Rock, it's not a game.

01:07:33.979 --> 01:07:37.763
You wanna live in a hospital
for five weeks this time?

01:07:37.899 --> 01:07:41.434
- You thought I was tough. He'll kill ya!
- All right.

01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:46.113
Come on. Get your head on your
shoulders, man. Think about the fight.

01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:49.325
Clubber Lang's in here.
He's tryin' to hurt you, Rock.

01:07:49.452 --> 01:07:52.240
Here it comes. Jab! He's jabbin'.

01:07:52.539 --> 01:07:56.537
He's tryin' to hurt you.
You gotta fight him. You gotta move.

01:07:57.669 --> 01:08:01.714
<i>He's up against the ropes.</i>
<i>He can't get out of the corner!</i>

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:07.918
He's hookin'! He's hookin'! He's hookin'!

01:08:08.054 --> 01:08:10.094
Damn, Rock! Come on!

01:08:11.016 --> 01:08:14.550
- What's the matter with you?
- Tomorrow. We'll do it tomorrow.

01:08:14.686 --> 01:08:17.224
There is no tomorrow!

01:08:17.898 --> 01:08:19.937
There is no tomorrow!

01:08:20.442 --> 01:08:22.481
<i>There is no tomorrow!</i>

01:08:28.198 --> 01:08:31.403
There's one thing you gotta remember.
We gotta get some speed.

01:08:31.536 --> 01:08:35.700
You gotta get some flexibility. You
gotta get some quickness. Understand?

01:08:35.832 --> 01:08:40.209
Quickness, endurance. That's all we
gotta concern ourselves with, Rock.

01:08:40.337 --> 01:08:42.743
Mickey never had me do this.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.296
Yeah. OK, here we go.

01:08:47.969 --> 01:08:49.629
Ready.

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:55.389
Set... Go!

01:08:58.897 --> 01:09:01.185
Come on. Come on.

01:09:08.323 --> 01:09:10.362
Come on.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.616
<i>You can't win, Rock.</i>

01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:17.955
<i>You ain't been hungry</i>
<i>since you won that belt.</i>

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:21.331
<i>He'll knock ya into tomorrow!</i>

01:10:05.297 --> 01:10:07.538
What's the matter?

01:10:08.133 --> 01:10:11.087
It's over. It's all over.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.936
What's the matter with you?

01:11:00.101 --> 01:11:02.094
Can I talk to you?

01:11:06.524 --> 01:11:10.439
I wanna ask you something important,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:14.650
- What?
- Why'd you come here?

01:11:16.034 --> 01:11:18.442
I just don't want it no more.

01:11:18.745 --> 01:11:24.166
- If it's over cos you want it to be, I'm glad.
- I do.

01:11:25.335 --> 01:11:29.498
It's just, you've never quit
anything since I've known you.

01:11:33.426 --> 01:11:37.590
I don't know what you want me to say.
I mean, what happened?

01:11:37.722 --> 01:11:40.296
How did everything
that was so good get so bad?

01:11:41.643 --> 01:11:43.849
What's so bad? Tell me. What?

01:11:43.979 --> 01:11:47.098
I wrecked everything
by not thinking for myself.

01:11:47.232 --> 01:11:50.683
Why couldn't Mickey tell me
where it was really at from the start?

01:11:50.819 --> 01:11:55.528
He didn't have to carry me and lie and
make me think I was better than I was.

01:11:55.657 --> 01:11:59.073
- He never lied.
- Those fights weren't right.

01:11:59.202 --> 01:12:01.325
I never fought anybody in their prime.

01:12:01.454 --> 01:12:05.499
There was always some angle to keep
the title longer than I shoulda had it.

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.499
Do you understand?

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:12.040
You've gotta understand, he loved you!
That was his job, protecting you.

01:12:12.173 --> 01:12:15.507
Protectin' don't help nothin'.
It makes things worse.

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:20.843
You wake up one day thinking you're
a winner, but you're not. You're a loser.

01:12:20.974 --> 01:12:23.761
So we wouldn't have had
the title as long. So what?

01:12:23.893 --> 01:12:26.811
- At least it would have been real.
- It was real!

01:12:26.938 --> 01:12:29.608
Nothing is real
if you don't believe in who you are.

01:12:29.774 --> 01:12:32.063
I don't believe in myself no more!

01:12:32.193 --> 01:12:35.562
When a fighter don't believe,
he's finished. That's it.

01:12:35.697 --> 01:12:38.781
That's not it.
Why don't you tell me the truth?

01:12:38.909 --> 01:12:42.112
What are you puttin' me through?
You wanna know the truth?

01:12:42.245 --> 01:12:44.285
I don't wanna lose what I got.

01:12:44.414 --> 01:12:48.827
At first, I didn't care about what happened.
I'd go in the ring, get bust up.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.080
But now there's you and the kid.
I don't wanna lose what I got!

01:12:52.213 --> 01:12:57.884
What do we have that can't be replaced?
What? A house. We got cars, money.

01:12:58.011 --> 01:13:01.676
We got everything but the truth.
What's the truth, dammit?!

01:13:01.806 --> 01:13:03.965
I'm afraid! All right?

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.434
You wanna hear me say it?
You wanna break me down? I'm afraid.

01:13:07.562 --> 01:13:09.555
For the first time, I'm afraid.

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:12.726
I'm afraid too.
There's nothin' wrong with that.

01:13:12.859 --> 01:13:15.730
- There is. For me, there is.
- Why? You're human.

01:13:15.862 --> 01:13:20.323
I don't know what I am. I know I'm a liar,
and because of that, Mickey ain't here.

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:25.159
You didn't push him into anything. He was
a grown man. He did what he had to do.

01:13:25.288 --> 01:13:27.993
And you have no right to feel guilty.
You don't!

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:31.626
You were a champion.
You did what you were expected to do.

01:13:31.753 --> 01:13:34.244
You did what everybody
thought you should do.

01:13:34.381 --> 01:13:38.592
And you wanna tell me that those fights
weren't real? I don't believe it!

01:13:39.135 --> 01:13:43.429
It doesn't matter what I believe.
You've got to carry that fear inside you,

01:13:43.556 --> 01:13:48.633
afraid everybody'll take things away,
that you'll be remembered as a coward,

01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:52.519
that you're not a man any more.
Well, none of it's true.

01:13:52.649 --> 01:13:57.358
It doesn't matter if I tell you because
you're the one that's got to settle it.

01:13:57.487 --> 01:14:02.730
Get rid of it! Cos when the smoke clears,
and they stop chanting your name,

01:14:02.867 --> 01:14:04.575
it's just gonna be us.

01:14:04.703 --> 01:14:08.119
And you can't live like this.
We can't live like this.

01:14:08.248 --> 01:14:13.491
Cos it's gonna bother you for the rest of
your life. Look what it's doing to you now.

01:14:18.675 --> 01:14:22.091
Apollo thinks you can do it. So do I.

01:14:22.804 --> 01:14:27.181
But you gotta wanna do it for the right
reasons. Not for the guilt over Mickey.

01:14:27.309 --> 01:14:32.765
Not for the people, not for the title,
not for money, or me - but for you.

01:14:33.607 --> 01:14:35.646
Just you. Just you alone.

01:14:39.613 --> 01:14:43.147
- And if I lose?
- Then you lose.

01:14:43.283 --> 01:14:48.075
But at least you lose with no excuses.
No fear.

01:14:48.204 --> 01:14:51.620
And I know you could live with that.

01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:01.377
How'd you get so tough?

01:15:02.594 --> 01:15:05.049
I live with a fighter.

01:15:11.186 --> 01:15:13.511
I really love you.

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:22.109
I love you.

01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:48.345
No, no, no. Rock, no.
Just flick it. Just flick it.

01:15:53.687 --> 01:15:55.726
Faster! Faster!

01:16:08.868 --> 01:16:11.194
Good. Five more laps.

01:16:13.248 --> 01:16:14.790
Punch it!

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:17.204
On your toes!

01:16:19.963 --> 01:16:23.795
<i>~ Gonna fly now ~</i>

01:16:25.051 --> 01:16:29.547
<i>~ It's all right now ~</i>

01:16:30.015 --> 01:16:34.593
<i>~ Flying high now... ~</i>

01:16:45.155 --> 01:16:47.194
Jab out! Get him!

01:16:49.284 --> 01:16:51.323
Gotta move it faster.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.408
Faster! Faster! Kick it!

01:17:02.047 --> 01:17:03.541
Very nice!

01:17:19.314 --> 01:17:21.639
Move your head. Beautiful!

01:17:22.067 --> 01:17:25.270
That's right. Under! Under and over.

01:17:25.403 --> 01:17:27.977
Send him out!

01:17:35.038 --> 01:17:39.783
<i>~ Feeling strong now ~</i>

01:17:39.918 --> 01:17:42.788
<i>~ Nothing wrong now ~</i>

01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:45.626
Faster. Faster. Yeah!

01:17:50.637 --> 01:17:53.210
Now! Yeah!

01:17:55.433 --> 01:17:58.221
Hey, Rocky the fish!

01:17:58.353 --> 01:18:00.013
Yeah! Yeah!

01:18:29.009 --> 01:18:33.801
<i>~ Gonna fly now ~</i>

01:18:33.930 --> 01:18:38.592
<i>~ Nothin' wrong now ~</i>

01:18:38.727 --> 01:18:43.934
<i>~ Gonna fly ~</i>

01:18:44.399 --> 01:18:49.026
<i>~ Fly, fly ~</i>

01:18:49.154 --> 01:18:52.653
<i>~ Fly ~</i>

01:18:54.451 --> 01:18:56.739
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>I'm Stu Nahan, with Bill Baldwin.</i>

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:59.622
<i>We welcome you</i>
<i>to Madison Square Garden.</i>

01:18:59.748 --> 01:19:02.369
It's the anxiously awaited rematch

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:07.495
between former champion Rocky Balboa
and the reigning champion Clubber Lang.

01:19:07.672 --> 01:19:11.966
We now switch to our remote
cameras inside the dressing rooms.

01:19:12.093 --> 01:19:15.925
Would you comment on how you plan
to fight Balboa? What's your strategy?

01:19:16.056 --> 01:19:19.057
Don't need any.
Balboa's so predictable and stupid.

01:19:19.184 --> 01:19:23.395
The man comes straight ahead. He's
tailor-made for me. He's gonna get hurt.

01:19:24.689 --> 01:19:28.023
- That's good.
- Turn 'em over. Good?

01:19:28.151 --> 01:19:30.607
How does that look? OK?

01:19:30.737 --> 01:19:33.358
No, I don't hate Balboa. But I pity the fool.

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:37.534
And I will destroy
any man who tries to take what I got.

01:19:40.872 --> 01:19:43.707
Remember where you came from.

01:19:43.833 --> 01:19:47.202
Remember what it took to get you here.

01:19:47.337 --> 01:19:50.124
And remember what
he did to you last time, right?

01:19:50.298 --> 01:19:53.999
Both are brawlers, with the edge
and power going to Clubber Lang,

01:19:54.135 --> 01:19:58.347
so I would say the odds are very long
against Balboa regaining his title.

01:19:58.807 --> 01:20:02.176
Now it's your turn. It's your turn, huh?

01:20:03.979 --> 01:20:06.018
What's your prediction for the fight?

01:20:06.147 --> 01:20:10.441
- Prediction?
- Yes. Prediction.

01:20:10.569 --> 01:20:12.360
Pain.

01:20:12.487 --> 01:20:15.488
Lang likes to hurt a man to the body.

01:20:15.615 --> 01:20:18.782
And Balboa may never have
psychologically recovered

01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:21.828
from that vicious knockout
that Clubber laid on him.

01:20:23.582 --> 01:20:25.621
It's time.

01:20:26.876 --> 01:20:28.916
- Here.
- What?

01:20:31.631 --> 01:20:34.122
I want you to wear these.

01:20:35.844 --> 01:20:40.719
Come on, Apollo. These are the colours
that you wore in our first fight together.

01:20:40.849 --> 01:20:43.422
I... I can't wear your colours.

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.098
Just wear 'em.

01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:48.269
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:49.274 --> 01:20:50.851
Thanks, Apollo.

01:20:50.984 --> 01:20:53.985
Just make sure you wash 'em
before you bring 'em back.

01:20:54.112 --> 01:20:56.318
Will do. Will do.

01:20:57.032 --> 01:20:59.867
- Thanks, Apollo.
- Hey, and remember,

01:20:59.993 --> 01:21:02.069
after this you owe me a favour.

01:21:02.662 --> 01:21:04.287
What favour?

01:21:04.414 --> 01:21:09.076
I'd have to agree. Toe to toe, Lang is
devastating, and he's much too strong.

01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:11.666
Rocky! Rocky!

01:21:11.796 --> 01:21:14.334
Listen. I wanna tell you
that I'm proud of you.

01:21:14.466 --> 01:21:18.131
It takes a helluva man to change,
and you did it. Prove it to 'em, right?

01:21:18.261 --> 01:21:20.384
- You did good, Apollo.
- Thanks, Paulie.

01:21:20.513 --> 01:21:22.553
Let's do it, Paulie.

01:21:23.683 --> 01:21:27.977
Here come Rocky and Apollo,
the two former champions.

01:21:34.861 --> 01:21:37.696
Look at the tenseness in his face,
that taut body.

01:21:37.822 --> 01:21:40.396
- Boy, does he look serious right now.
- He does.

01:21:40.533 --> 01:21:45.492
You know, Stu, the word is that this is
Rocky's last fight - win, lose or draw.

01:21:45.622 --> 01:21:50.200
There he is, the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring.

01:21:50.335 --> 01:21:54.878
Boy, he looks incredibly thin.
I'd say he's gotta be about 20lb lighter.

01:21:55.006 --> 01:21:57.793
Rocky Balboa,
the iron man from Philadelphia.

01:21:57.926 --> 01:22:00.880
This crowd is with him tonight. Listen.

01:22:02.806 --> 01:22:05.213
Balboa doesn't really have
any boxing skills.

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:08.055
But I've never seen as much
raw determination...

01:22:08.186 --> 01:22:10.095
Hold it, Stu.

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:13.848
Here comes the champion now,
Clubber Lang. Look at this crowd.

01:22:15.986 --> 01:22:21.656
Look at those eyes. I've never seen
a guy with such sullen eyes. He is tough.

01:22:21.783 --> 01:22:24.903
Clubber, go back where you came from!

01:22:26.329 --> 01:22:29.829
He even belted a spectator.
Did you see that? Look at that man.

01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:33.872
Boy, awesome. Man, he's tough.

01:22:34.004 --> 01:22:38.048
Clubber Lang,
the heavyweight champion of the world!

01:22:38.466 --> 01:22:40.755
Hey, fool! You ready for another beatin'?

01:22:40.885 --> 01:22:43.092
You should've never came back!

01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:45.593
- Don't look at him.
- Let's just be cool.

01:22:45.849 --> 01:22:47.806
Hey, boy.

01:22:47.934 --> 01:22:51.884
Hey, boy. After I crucify him, you're next.

01:22:52.063 --> 01:22:55.432
- Just stay outta my face, chump.
- Don't turn your back on me.

01:22:55.567 --> 01:22:58.521
We got a brawl before the bell.

01:22:59.321 --> 01:23:01.444
This ring is ready to explode!

01:23:01.573 --> 01:23:04.740
With the fight about to officially begin...

01:23:06.286 --> 01:23:09.821
- I'm gonna get you! Let him go!
- Come on!

01:23:09.956 --> 01:23:12.115
Let him go! I want him!

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.290
- You said be cool.
- That was cool.

01:23:14.419 --> 01:23:17.373
I'm the champ!
I'll beat ya like I did last time.

01:23:17.505 --> 01:23:20.506
You won't have to look to find me.
I'm here.

01:23:20.634 --> 01:23:23.800
Boxing fans around the world,

01:23:23.929 --> 01:23:26.550
welcome to Madison Square Garden

01:23:26.681 --> 01:23:30.679
and tonight's heavyweight
championship of the world!

01:23:32.938 --> 01:23:34.977
Out of the red corner,

01:23:35.106 --> 01:23:40.148
the challenger, weighing 191 lb,

01:23:40.278 --> 01:23:43.694
from the fighting city of Philadelphia,

01:23:43.823 --> 01:23:47.074
the former heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:23:47.202 --> 01:23:49.360
the Italian Stallion,

01:23:49.496 --> 01:23:55.036
Rocky Balboa!

01:24:00.382 --> 01:24:03.916
I tell ya, he has so slimmed down,
he looks like a middleweight.

01:24:04.552 --> 01:24:09.974
Out of the blue corner, weighing 237lb,

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:13.303
the hard-punching pedlar from Chicago,

01:24:13.478 --> 01:24:17.606
the reigning heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:24:17.732 --> 01:24:20.769
Clubber Lang!

01:24:21.778 --> 01:24:24.150
Referee, Lou Filippo.

01:24:24.823 --> 01:24:26.946
OK, boys. Let's go.

01:24:27.617 --> 01:24:31.200
We went over the rules yesterday.
I'm gonna repeat a few of 'em.

01:24:31.329 --> 01:24:33.536
Watch your low blows
and rabbit punches.

01:24:33.665 --> 01:24:36.500
In case of a knockdown,
go to the corner I tell you to,

01:24:36.626 --> 01:24:39.378
and you stay there
until I tell you to come out.

01:24:39.504 --> 01:24:42.339
Is that understood? Any questions?

01:24:42.465 --> 01:24:44.707
Let's go back to your corner now.
Let's go.

01:24:45.927 --> 01:24:49.510
- I'm gonna bust you up.
- Go for it.

01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:56.393
Here we go. The war is on!
We're just waiting for the bell.

01:24:56.521 --> 01:24:58.810
Take my belt off. I'll get that chump.

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:02.356
Don't let this bum let you fight his fight.
You're the best!

01:25:03.403 --> 01:25:05.111
Hell.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.815
Rhythm and power. Then jab him.

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.990
Rocky! Rocky!

01:25:14.289 --> 01:25:16.910
It should be a great fight!

01:25:18.168 --> 01:25:22.379
Balboa goes right out of his corner
and right after Clubber Lang.

01:25:22.505 --> 01:25:26.455
He's going right to left, into Clubber's
face. What a start to the fight!

01:25:26.593 --> 01:25:29.547
Another jab. Another jab.

01:25:30.096 --> 01:25:33.263
And another!
This is not the Rocky we expected!

01:25:33.558 --> 01:25:35.681
Looks fantastic.

01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:43.476
Another right. And a right.
Look at that! A right and left to the head!

01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:48.106
Clubber Lang doesn't know what's
happening. He's being stung by this style.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.110
Look at the shots he's taking.

01:25:53.161 --> 01:25:57.989
- He can't corner the fleet-footed fighter.
- It's absolutely unbelievable!

01:25:59.668 --> 01:26:02.503
Come on, you oversized hick!
Bring it to me! Hit me!

01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:05.416
That right hand is like a triphammer!

01:26:08.927 --> 01:26:11.299
- Rock, tie him up!
- Bring it to me! Hit me!

01:26:11.805 --> 01:26:14.343
Come on, get back. Get back!

01:26:14.474 --> 01:26:17.392
Tough first round!

01:26:17.519 --> 01:26:20.188
There's Rocky
with a couple of rights and lefts.

01:26:20.313 --> 01:26:22.520
Get off! Get off!

01:26:23.358 --> 01:26:26.193
This crowd is going absolutely wild.

01:26:52.637 --> 01:26:57.050
We got pandemonium in the ring
at the end of round one.

01:26:57.183 --> 01:27:01.098
Lang wants more.
He can't realise that the round is over!

01:27:03.315 --> 01:27:07.562
All right, you looked great.
Just don't get crazy and we're home.

01:27:07.694 --> 01:27:10.529
- I'll kill you, man
- The man is strong.

01:27:10.655 --> 01:27:13.941
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him.

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:17.700
Now he's gonna come hard, right?

01:27:17.829 --> 01:27:22.954
- Don't give him a chance to settle.
- Counter and move. Counter and move.

01:27:23.084 --> 01:27:26.204
He had Lang at his mercy!

01:27:30.592 --> 01:27:34.459
Now it's Lang coming out for Rocky.

01:27:35.472 --> 01:27:40.549
Rocky has him in his corner
and is still landing rights and lefts.

01:27:41.269 --> 01:27:43.476
A right to the head. Another.

01:27:43.605 --> 01:27:47.353
He's really setting him up.
Five unanswered shots!

01:27:48.693 --> 01:27:51.445
Kill him! Kill him!

01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:56.942
- Get outta there!
- Get back!

01:28:02.249 --> 01:28:04.918
All right!

01:28:06.962 --> 01:28:09.085
Break it up. Break it up.

01:28:09.214 --> 01:28:12.417
- What are you doin'?
- Come on, Balboa.

01:28:14.302 --> 01:28:16.591
Get your hands up. Come on, Rock!

01:28:18.056 --> 01:28:20.725
That right hand hurt Rocky again!

01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:25.513
Balboa's in trouble now.

01:28:29.776 --> 01:28:32.314
Hold him, dammit!

01:28:33.572 --> 01:28:37.949
- Come on, Rocky!
- This is Clubber's round.

01:28:43.873 --> 01:28:45.913
And Balboa is down.

01:28:47.168 --> 01:28:49.659
- Get up, dammit!
- Come on.

01:28:50.297 --> 01:28:52.538
- Five!
- He's in trouble.

01:28:52.674 --> 01:28:54.916
Six!

01:28:55.051 --> 01:28:56.961
Seven!

01:28:58.096 --> 01:29:02.260
It's Clubber again. Lang with the left hand.
Another left and a right!

01:29:04.894 --> 01:29:07.136
And down goes Balboa again.

01:29:08.607 --> 01:29:10.184
Stop the fight.

01:29:10.609 --> 01:29:13.859
- Six!
- I got some more, so get up.

01:29:14.321 --> 01:29:16.360
I got a lotta moves. Come on!

01:29:16.489 --> 01:29:19.407
Here we go again.
Clubber coming into him!

01:29:24.372 --> 01:29:27.492
You ain't so bad. You ain't so bad.

01:29:28.335 --> 01:29:30.493
You ain't so bad. You ain't nothin!

01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:33.713
You must be crazy.
You're just a stupid fool.

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:37.624
- But I ain't breathin' heavy.
- He's a fool. He's stupid.

01:29:37.761 --> 01:29:39.884
How could he come back
from that beating?

01:29:40.013 --> 01:29:42.219
What the hell are you doin'?

01:29:42.349 --> 01:29:46.216
- It's a strategy. I know what I'm doin'.
- You don't know.

01:29:46.353 --> 01:29:50.053
- He's gotta come to you.
- He's nothin'. He's mine.

01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:54.567
Stand toe to toe with this bum and
he'll kill you. He'll beat your head off.

01:29:54.694 --> 01:29:56.603
He's gettin' tired.

01:29:57.530 --> 01:30:01.824
Don't go wasting your punches.
Don't try to take him out with one punch.

01:30:01.993 --> 01:30:05.279
Use your head. You wear him down.
He's all ours.

01:30:05.664 --> 01:30:07.324
I know what I'm doin'.

01:30:07.457 --> 01:30:11.870
Don't tell me what you think!
Go out there and do it. Eye of the tiger.

01:30:13.505 --> 01:30:16.874
Knock his head off. He's just a man.

01:30:17.634 --> 01:30:21.466
Be more man than him.
Go get him. Eye of the tiger.

01:30:24.349 --> 01:30:29.260
Round three - tough round to call.
This is a little slower...

01:30:29.396 --> 01:30:31.472
It's my round.

01:30:31.606 --> 01:30:34.524
I'm gonna take ya this time.

01:30:34.651 --> 01:30:36.940
You're mine. You're mine.

01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:39.857
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm gonna get ya.

01:30:52.502 --> 01:30:55.123
Get outta there.

01:30:58.925 --> 01:31:01.001
Get outta there!

01:31:01.136 --> 01:31:03.674
- Come on.
- Stick him.

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:09.140
Come on!

01:31:10.604 --> 01:31:12.228
Again, again!

01:31:12.439 --> 01:31:16.187
- He's gettin' killed
- No, no, no, he's not. He's gettin' mad.

01:31:16.318 --> 01:31:19.022
The whole world's watching.
Knock me out.

01:31:20.655 --> 01:31:23.360
Harder! Can you hit hard? Hit me harder!

01:31:30.498 --> 01:31:32.408
Get outta there!

01:31:34.377 --> 01:31:36.833
Rocky!

01:31:41.468 --> 01:31:42.962
Yeah!

01:31:43.803 --> 01:31:46.092
My mother hits harder than that. Come on!

01:31:46.222 --> 01:31:48.429
A little harder. Hit me on the face.

01:31:50.143 --> 01:31:52.266
Come on, champ. You ain't so bad.

01:31:52.854 --> 01:31:54.977
You ain't nothin'.

01:31:57.442 --> 01:31:58.901
Rocky!

01:31:59.027 --> 01:32:01.898
Rocky! Rocky!

01:32:14.918 --> 01:32:18.666
I might believe the strategy now.
He's making Clubber miss!

01:32:18.797 --> 01:32:23.257
He drew him in. Now Rocky's throwing
the punches. Look at the punches.

01:32:25.345 --> 01:32:29.888
He's lifting him right off
the canvas with those punches!

01:32:34.604 --> 01:32:36.644
He's completely psyched out!

01:32:38.316 --> 01:32:41.021
Lang is confused by all of this!

01:33:14.603 --> 01:33:15.931
Come on!

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.156
The place is going bananas!

01:33:30.827 --> 01:33:33.152
- Get up!
- Five!

01:33:33.288 --> 01:33:34.403
Six!

01:33:34.873 --> 01:33:36.533
Seven!

01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:38.706
Eight! Nine!

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.498
Ten. You're out.

01:33:50.555 --> 01:33:56.558
There he is, the new heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

01:33:58.897 --> 01:34:00.936
Rocky is exhausted.

01:34:06.321 --> 01:34:10.153
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner by knockout...

01:34:10.283 --> 01:34:14.495
- Are you all right?
- Never better. Never better.

01:34:15.705 --> 01:34:20.166
...the heavyweight champion of the world,
the Italian Stallion,

01:34:20.293 --> 01:34:23.128
Rocky Balboa!

01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:36.344
- We made a deal.
- I know, but this is extremely crazy.

01:34:36.476 --> 01:34:38.516
Yeah. Mentally irregular, right?

01:34:38.645 --> 01:34:41.397
But it makes sense. You owe me a favour.

01:34:41.523 --> 01:34:44.393
I know, but... When did you think of this?

01:34:44.526 --> 01:34:48.226
- About three years ago.
- This is very crazy, Apollo.

01:34:48.363 --> 01:34:53.523
Stallion, when you won that last fight,
you beat me by one second.

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:56.151
That's hard for
an intelligent man to handle.

01:34:56.288 --> 01:35:00.332
- Didn't you say you learnt to live with it?
- I lied.

01:35:00.458 --> 01:35:02.949
Oh, you lied!

01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:08.412
- So now you gotta prove it to yourself?
- No TV, no newspapers. Just you and me.

01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:11.586
Nothin'. Just you and me.
Age before beauty.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.923
- Anything you say.
- I'll do all the work, OK?

01:35:15.056 --> 01:35:19.184
You better go slow cos you ain't
as young as springtime any more.

01:35:19.311 --> 01:35:21.884
I'm still young enough to whip your butt.

01:35:22.022 --> 01:35:25.521
Yeah? How you gonna do that?
You taught me everything you know.

01:35:25.859 --> 01:35:31.233
Almost everything. You gotta remember,
you fight great, but I'm a great fighter.

01:35:31.364 --> 01:35:34.069
- You ready?
- Absolutely.

01:35:35.285 --> 01:35:38.784
You know, Stallion,
it's too bad we gotta get old.

01:35:40.557 --> 01:35:42.596
Ah, just keep punchin', Apollo.

01:35:44.769 --> 01:35:46.809
You wanna ring the bell?

01:35:46.938 --> 01:35:48.136
All right.

01:35:48.273 --> 01:35:50.312
Ding-ding.

01:35:51.443 --> 01:35:53.482
Come on, Stallion.

01:35:53.987 --> 01:35:55.861
Come on, come on.

01:35:56.489 --> 01:35:59.027
Boy, you really move good
for an older guy.

01:36:00.577 --> 01:36:03.282
You're lookin' good. I taught you well.

01:36:03.872 --> 01:36:07.075
I think you taught me too good.
Look at him fly.

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:10.542
Look out now. No, no, you don't
want any of this. Come on.

01:36:11.963 --> 01:36:15.964
- Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.
- Watch yourself. Ready?

01:36:16.384 --> 01:36:20.252
