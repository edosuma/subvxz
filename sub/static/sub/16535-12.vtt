WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:01.304
Yeah, so if you want to roll to

00:01.305 --> 00:02.602
the Laugh Factory with me tonight,

00:02.626 --> 00:04.866
I think that would be dope.
I signed up for the open mic.

00:04.926 --> 00:06.093
- Yeah.
- You did it.

00:06.127 --> 00:08.630
- I could use a friendly face.
- That's awesome, man.

00:08.664 --> 00:11.720
I'm excited for you.
Um, give me a preview.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.688
- Yeah?
- Show me what you got.

00:13.723 --> 00:16.691
Okay. Okay, so, um, ahem.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.693
So, what's the only place in Chicago

00:18.728 --> 00:20.695
that has 24-hour police protection?

00:20.730 --> 00:23.631
Donut shop?

00:23.666 --> 00:25.867
- You heard that one?
- A couple of times.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.379
Yeah, donut... donut shop. That gets...

00:27.403 --> 00:29.904
that gets laughs usually.

00:29.939 --> 00:31.973
Look, I thought you wanted to do, like,

00:32.008 --> 00:33.575
more observational comedy.

00:33.609 --> 00:34.920
Yeah, I was... thinking about that.

00:34.944 --> 00:36.978
Kevin, you're funny.

00:37.013 --> 00:38.847
Just do Atwater.

00:38.881 --> 00:41.483
Okay.

00:41.517 --> 00:42.550
Do Atwater.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.686
You left a working case
file in the front seat

00:44.720 --> 00:46.321
of your covert car.

00:48.758 --> 00:51.426
Yeah, but it was parked
in our secure police lot.

00:51.460 --> 00:52.861
Which is filled with nosy cops

00:52.895 --> 00:55.697
who want to get into our business.

00:55.731 --> 00:57.999
Everything we do in this
unit is confidential.

00:58.034 --> 00:59.000
Everything.

00:59.035 --> 01:00.568
Be right there.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.670
Patrol found the body of a dead woman

01:02.705 --> 01:04.739
in Washington Park.
We're getting called in.

01:09.478 --> 01:11.446
Spoke to the first officer on the scene.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.015
Said it looks like
she was out for a jog.

01:14.050 --> 01:16.017
Pants are pulled down around her ankles.

01:16.052 --> 01:19.587
M.E. will tell us if it is
what it looks like it is.

01:26.896 --> 01:29.364
- She's still warm.
- First responding officers

01:29.398 --> 01:31.066
called an ambulance right away,

01:31.100 --> 01:32.867
even though they couldn't find a pulse.

01:32.902 --> 01:34.369
They found a phone near the body.

01:34.403 --> 01:37.072
I called 911 and the
dispatcher gave me her name.

01:37.106 --> 01:38.940
- Zoey Sims.
- Zoey Sims.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.576
Yeah. Well, nobody in this neighborhood

01:41.610 --> 01:43.044
leaves a bottle half full.

01:43.079 --> 01:44.546
I want it hand delivered to the lab.

01:44.580 --> 01:45.814
This just happened.

01:45.848 --> 01:48.083
Whoever did it can't be far away.

01:48.117 --> 01:50.051
I saw these two guys near the woods.

01:50.086 --> 01:51.897
- They whistled at me.
- You mean like catcalls.

01:51.921 --> 01:54.889
No, it was more than that.
They tried to get me to stop.

01:54.924 --> 01:57.559
They had a bottle of vodka,
so I just kept running.

01:57.593 --> 01:58.760
Can you describe these guys?

01:58.794 --> 02:01.896
They were black. One of
them had a red hoodie.

02:01.931 --> 02:04.065
Then I saw two black guys running away.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.734
- They went into the trees.
- Can you describe them?

02:06.769 --> 02:08.013
One had a red sweatshirt with a hoodie.

02:08.037 --> 02:09.804
The other had a black baseball hat.

02:09.839 --> 02:10.905
Burgess!

02:10.940 --> 02:12.984
Patrol just spotted the
subjects over on Green Street.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.109
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

02:14.143 --> 02:17.645
5021 David, we have two
male blacks fleeing westbound

02:17.680 --> 02:19.414
on foot in the 5200 block.

02:19.448 --> 02:20.949
<i>Copy that, 5021 David.</i>

02:27.022 --> 02:28.957
Chicago PD!

02:30.159 --> 02:32.227
- We good?
- Go, go!

02:34.964 --> 02:36.064
Chicago PD!

02:39.668 --> 02:40.935
Clear. Go!

02:45.908 --> 02:48.143
I got right, I got right!

02:50.212 --> 02:51.946
Chicago PD.

02:51.981 --> 02:53.848
You seen two guys? Red hoodie?

02:53.883 --> 02:55.717
They went into the church.

03:02.158 --> 03:03.825
Suspects went in the church, boss.

03:03.859 --> 03:04.726
Door's locked.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.462
- All right. Cover the sides and rear.
- Copy that.

03:07.496 --> 03:11.166
I'm sorry, Officers, but
unless you're here to pray,

03:11.200 --> 03:12.867
you can't come inside.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.969
Okay, Father...

03:15.004 --> 03:17.639
I have witnesses saw two
men go inside your church

03:17.673 --> 03:19.807
that are suspects in a rape and murder.

03:19.842 --> 03:21.887
We'll be very respectful, but
we need to go in and get 'em.

03:21.911 --> 03:24.846
First of all, they're
not men. They're boys.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.482
And they now have sanctuary
inside this church.

03:27.516 --> 03:31.252
- Like hell they do.
- Hey, Kenny.

03:31.287 --> 03:33.521
We can't go in.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.259
Father, there's no need to
escalate the situation, okay?

03:38.294 --> 03:40.862
A young woman was just
murdered in Washington Park.

03:40.896 --> 03:43.998
The boys inside your church
were at the scene of the crime.

03:44.033 --> 03:44.999
But I just talked to them.

03:45.034 --> 03:46.278
They said all they
were doing was drinking.

03:46.302 --> 03:47.835
That's great. If that's the case,

03:47.870 --> 03:49.181
- send 'em out, I'll clear 'em.
- I can't.

03:49.205 --> 03:51.172
- It's your church.
- It's God's church.

03:51.207 --> 03:53.174
These boys asked for my protection,

03:53.209 --> 03:55.944
and I've taken a sacred
vow to provide sanctuary

03:55.978 --> 03:58.046
- when it's requested.
- And I've taken a sacred vow

03:58.080 --> 03:59.581
to protect the people of this city.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.255
Now just because
they're inside the church

04:01.283 --> 04:02.527
doesn't mean they're above the law.

04:02.551 --> 04:04.786
Father, I grew up Catholic.

04:04.820 --> 04:07.288
Priests in my church
always respected the police.

04:07.323 --> 04:08.623
And if you committed a sin,

04:08.657 --> 04:09.935
you were supposed to be punished.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.759
I happen to know these boys.

04:11.794 --> 04:14.896
They're in foster care.
They have no parents.

04:14.930 --> 04:16.798
They have no money for a lawyer.

04:16.832 --> 04:19.634
There's nobody to stand
for them except us,

04:19.668 --> 04:21.269
and we're not going anywhere.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.271
We're not going anywhere!

04:25.074 --> 04:27.041
You're gonna have to arrest all of us.

04:27.076 --> 04:29.244
- Amen.
- That's right, amen.

04:29.278 --> 04:31.546
All right, I want
uniforms on every exit.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.091
We're gonna clear and
commandeer this building.

04:33.115 --> 04:35.216
Get CPIC out here,
bring mobile computers,

04:35.251 --> 04:38.953
set up a hard line.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.888
We're not going anywhere either.

04:48.645 --> 04:51.446
We're setting up a one block
perimeter around the church.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.448
There's more protesters on the way.

04:53.482 --> 04:55.517
Let's go to our posts.

04:57.853 --> 05:00.855
Forensics fast-tracked
photos from the crime scene.

05:00.890 --> 05:02.657
The M.E. says the victim's injuries

05:02.692 --> 05:03.625
are consistent with strangulation.

05:03.659 --> 05:06.494
And she shows clear
signs of sexual assault.

05:06.529 --> 05:08.396
Vaginal tearing. They're
running the DNA now.

05:08.431 --> 05:11.566
DOA was Zoey Sims. 27 years old.

05:11.601 --> 05:12.968
According to her Linkedin profile,

05:13.002 --> 05:15.503
she was a saleswoman
at a relocation company.

05:15.538 --> 05:18.673
She's not in any law enforcement
databases, never been arrested.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.752
The guy who does have a
long rap sheet is the priest.

05:20.776 --> 05:23.311
Father Bill McSorely's
been arrested 11 times,

05:23.346 --> 05:24.679
civil disobedience stuff,

05:24.714 --> 05:26.314
most recently for defacing

05:26.349 --> 05:27.882
liquor billboards in his neighborhood.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.684
Hey, Al, don't you
have some kind of beef

05:29.719 --> 05:30.852
with Father McSorely?

05:30.886 --> 05:32.754
Father McSoundbite.

05:32.788 --> 05:35.257
Loves to point fingers at cops.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.492
Threw one of my old
partners under the bus.

05:37.526 --> 05:39.427
It's quite a scene out there.

05:39.462 --> 05:41.029
Thanks for coming down.

05:41.063 --> 05:42.608
Yeah, I understand you
have a couple of suspects

05:42.632 --> 05:44.443
claiming sanctuary
protection inside the church.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.501
How long can they stay?

05:46.535 --> 05:47.546
As long as the priest will have them.

05:47.570 --> 05:48.770
Look at this.

05:48.804 --> 05:50.572
Why are we waiting
around on some custom?

05:50.606 --> 05:53.608
Because, Kenny, it's not
some back alley gang bust.

05:53.643 --> 05:55.554
If we're gonna pull those
boys out of that church

05:55.578 --> 05:57.689
with the whole city watching,
it's gonna be with a warrant

05:57.713 --> 05:59.781
and an airtight case.

05:59.815 --> 06:01.793
All right, check the POD
footage on the park cameras.

06:01.817 --> 06:03.852
And let's find out who Zoey is.

06:03.886 --> 06:06.855
Okay, run her emails,
check her phone records.

06:06.889 --> 06:10.959
And let's notify her family
before they hear it on the news.

06:10.993 --> 06:13.028
Al, you and Burgess.

06:14.997 --> 06:17.565
The parent never wants
to believe it, you know?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.601
Sometimes they push you away.

06:19.635 --> 06:22.537
So, make sure we're inside
before you give them the news.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.474
Anything else?

06:26.509 --> 06:29.044
Yeah, you're about to
shatter somebody's world.

06:29.078 --> 06:31.112
Just gotta deal with it.

06:37.086 --> 06:39.421
- Are you Lisa Sims?
- Why?

06:39.455 --> 06:41.133
We're Chicago PD. Do
you mind if we come in?

06:41.157 --> 06:42.991
What is this about?

06:43.025 --> 06:44.659
It's better if we talk inside.

06:44.694 --> 06:46.795
Is this about the girl they
found in Washington Park?

06:46.829 --> 06:49.764
- Mrs. Sims...
- My daughter jogs in that park.

06:49.799 --> 06:51.733
Is this about Zoey?

06:51.767 --> 06:53.468
- I'm afraid it is.
- God, no, no, no.

06:53.502 --> 06:54.469
Ma'am, please.

06:54.503 --> 06:57.572
- No, no...
- Ma'am... ma'am, please.

06:57.606 --> 06:59.708
Please, please.

07:02.478 --> 07:04.846
When I saw the news,

07:04.880 --> 07:08.683
I kept trying to call Zoey.

07:08.718 --> 07:11.586
When she didn't pick up,
I knew something was wrong.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.122
I'm sorry. I know how painful this is,

07:14.156 --> 07:16.758
but we do have to ask
a few more questions.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.493
When was the last time you saw her?

07:18.527 --> 07:21.696
Two weeks ago.

07:21.731 --> 07:23.531
When she was sad, she would come over

07:23.566 --> 07:25.433
and we'd watch old movies.

07:25.468 --> 07:29.771
- Why was she sad?
- Her boyfriend, Travis.

07:29.805 --> 07:31.706
Zoey wanted to break up,

07:31.741 --> 07:33.808
but she was scared.

07:33.933 --> 07:36.134
Scared? What? That he would hurt her?

07:36.168 --> 07:38.937
That she'd hurt him.

07:38.971 --> 07:41.873
They were high school sweethearts.

07:41.907 --> 07:44.542
She changed, he didn't.

07:45.845 --> 07:48.480
Eddie.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.982
- I just got your message.
- I'm sorry, who are you?

07:51.016 --> 07:52.750
I'm Zoey's stepfather.

07:52.785 --> 07:55.753
- You know who killed her?
- We have two suspects.

07:55.788 --> 07:57.622
Then why are you here?

07:57.656 --> 07:58.967
You should be out talking to them.

07:58.991 --> 08:01.226
Eddie, they're just doing their job.

08:01.260 --> 08:04.295
Yeah, all right. All
right, look, just...

08:04.330 --> 08:06.598
can you just give us our space now?

08:06.632 --> 08:07.966
- Um...
- Yeah.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.667
Okay.

08:09.702 --> 08:13.004
What was Zoey's boyfriend's
last name though?

08:13.038 --> 08:15.073
James.

08:19.545 --> 08:22.013
Travis James, Chicago PD.

08:24.216 --> 08:26.284
Open up!

08:30.689 --> 08:32.524
What's going on in here?

08:34.226 --> 08:36.294
I put my fist through a mirror.

08:38.631 --> 08:42.534
When I found out, I just
started breaking everything.

08:42.568 --> 08:45.603
Without Zoey, I got nothing.

08:45.638 --> 08:47.539
When was the last time you saw Zoey?

08:47.573 --> 08:49.707
Two days ago.

08:49.842 --> 08:51.309
You didn't see her this morning?

08:51.343 --> 08:53.878
No, I was in bed.

08:53.912 --> 08:56.981
Travis, Zoey's mom said the
two of you were having problems.

08:57.016 --> 09:01.052
That's not true. We
were gonna get married.

09:01.086 --> 09:04.822
Her mom said Zoey was
breaking up with you.

09:04.857 --> 09:06.391
What are you talking about?

09:06.425 --> 09:07.825
Why are you even here?

09:07.860 --> 09:10.061
The guys that killed
Zoey are in that church.

09:10.095 --> 09:11.473
Can anybody verify where
you were this morning?

09:11.497 --> 09:12.697
Yeah, my pillow.

09:12.731 --> 09:15.299
You're gonna have to do
better than that. Come on.

09:15.334 --> 09:16.901
What? You gonna arrest me?

09:16.935 --> 09:20.171
Go ahead. I got nothing left to lose.

09:20.205 --> 09:22.240
No?

09:22.274 --> 09:24.308
Great. Just leave me alone.

09:29.381 --> 09:31.182
Okay, so I went through
all of the POD footage

09:31.216 --> 09:32.383
from Washington Park.

09:32.418 --> 09:34.952
As you can see right here
on the north end of the park,

09:34.987 --> 09:36.187
we find Zoey Sims.

09:36.221 --> 09:38.856
A bunch of different cameras
can capture her along the way.

09:38.891 --> 09:40.368
Right now, there's nobody really around.

09:40.392 --> 09:42.093
But seven minutes later,

09:42.127 --> 09:44.362
We find our witness at
the scene, Jane Henderson,

09:44.396 --> 09:47.098
who claims that she was followed
by an African-American male

09:47.132 --> 09:49.467
in a red sweatshirt who shows up

09:49.501 --> 09:52.470
two minutes later right here.

09:52.504 --> 09:55.139
Now after that, we
don't have any cameras

09:55.174 --> 09:58.309
and we find the body 300
yards ahead in the woods.

09:58.343 --> 10:02.346
Hey, we got a problem out here, come on.

10:02.381 --> 10:03.948
Let's be brutally honest.

10:03.982 --> 10:05.783
The history of justice
for young black men

10:05.818 --> 10:09.287
at the hands of Chicago
police has not been glorious.

10:09.321 --> 10:11.823
If these boys are innocent,
why not let them talk to police?

10:11.857 --> 10:14.392
You don't think the police are
capable of getting a confession

10:14.426 --> 10:15.660
from innocent people?

10:15.694 --> 10:18.830
We're making a stand to bring
transparency to this process.

10:18.864 --> 10:19.964
How dare you!

10:19.998 --> 10:23.401
You're protecting the monsters
who killed my daughter.

10:23.435 --> 10:26.838
Mrs. Sims, I am so
sorry about your daughter.

10:26.872 --> 10:28.973
I promise you I am
holding her in my prayer...

10:29.908 --> 10:31.375
Get the killers out of your church!

10:33.378 --> 10:35.246
Take it easy!

10:37.000 --> 10:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:44.802 --> 10:47.235
Well, Father, you got a
lot of people stirred up.

10:47.269 --> 10:49.303
They're at each other's throats.

10:49.338 --> 10:52.106
And it doesn't change the simple fact

10:52.141 --> 10:53.608
that the two boys in your church

10:53.642 --> 10:54.709
are suspects in a murder.

10:54.743 --> 10:56.477
Let me clarify something.

10:56.512 --> 10:59.046
I didn't ask those boys
to come into my church.

10:59.081 --> 11:01.282
The situation took on a life of its own.

11:01.316 --> 11:03.518
And those news trucks,

11:03.552 --> 11:05.052
was that divine intervention?

11:05.087 --> 11:07.655
I thought the CPD might
need extra motivation

11:07.689 --> 11:09.657
to show restraint.

11:09.691 --> 11:12.160
Here's all the motivation I need.

11:14.363 --> 11:18.199
Her name was Zoey Sims.

11:18.233 --> 11:21.469
I don't need any more
motivation, Father.

11:21.503 --> 11:23.638
It's horrible what happened,

11:23.672 --> 11:26.474
but I have to give the boys
the benefit of the doubt.

11:26.508 --> 11:27.542
Publicly.

11:27.576 --> 11:28.476
Father, the prints came back

11:28.510 --> 11:32.547
from the bottle of vodka
found near the body.

11:32.581 --> 11:35.516
Miles Vincent.

11:35.551 --> 11:37.652
Jaylen Hines.

11:37.686 --> 11:40.254
They the ones inside?

11:40.289 --> 11:42.490
They're good kids.

11:42.524 --> 11:46.994
They used to play basketball
at the church league.

11:47.029 --> 11:48.763
And they drifted.

11:48.797 --> 11:50.665
You get born into this neighborhood,

11:50.699 --> 11:52.667
it's the opposite of
winning the lottery.

11:52.701 --> 11:55.670
Understand. You're
worried about the boys.

11:55.704 --> 11:57.772
But, Father, I'm worried that this thing

11:57.806 --> 12:00.007
is gonna get real ugly real fast

12:00.042 --> 12:03.377
if we don't open those doors.

12:03.412 --> 12:06.414
When we first met and
you were in the gang unit

12:06.448 --> 12:13.254
and I was holding that little
boy's bleeding head in my hands,

12:13.288 --> 12:16.524
Kenyon Thompson...

12:16.558 --> 12:20.027
he was so scared.

12:20.062 --> 12:24.065
And you and I watched
the life go out of him.

12:24.099 --> 12:26.167
I remember.

12:28.337 --> 12:31.405
We said we would change things,

12:31.440 --> 12:33.708
and we haven't.

12:33.742 --> 12:35.376
It's gotten worse.

12:35.410 --> 12:37.378
We're on the front lines,
and we're just watching,

12:37.412 --> 12:39.714
and nothing is changing.

12:39.748 --> 12:41.749
Father,

12:41.783 --> 12:45.553
we're not gonna change anything
by ignoring the victims.

12:47.389 --> 12:49.891
Miles Vincent, 16 years old,

12:49.925 --> 12:52.026
and Jaylen Hines, 15 years old.

12:52.061 --> 12:53.271
They're both in the foster care system,

12:53.295 --> 12:54.606
and they're both in the same home.

12:54.630 --> 12:55.740
These boys have a history
of trouble together.

12:55.764 --> 12:58.866
They got popped for stealing
a car stereo just last year.

12:58.901 --> 13:00.535
What are we waiting around for?

13:00.569 --> 13:02.280
Some angel to whisper
into the priest's ear?

13:02.304 --> 13:04.072
Relax.

13:04.106 --> 13:05.907
Hey, you know who runs Wash Park?

13:05.941 --> 13:07.385
- Yeah, G-Park Lords.
- All right, see if the boys

13:07.409 --> 13:08.443
were jumped into a gang.

13:08.477 --> 13:10.611
And if we have to start
throwing charges or arrests,

13:10.646 --> 13:12.480
you go at them with both barrels.

13:12.514 --> 13:13.558
All right, I want to start building

13:13.582 --> 13:15.483
a timeline on these boys.

13:15.517 --> 13:18.453
And let's talk to Zoey's
coworkers, her friends.

13:18.487 --> 13:22.657
Let's make sure we haven't
overlooked anything.

13:22.691 --> 13:24.425
This is a tragedy. I do...

13:24.460 --> 13:26.928
I don't even know what to say.

13:26.962 --> 13:29.063
This is Zoey's desk.

13:29.098 --> 13:30.431
Was.

13:30.466 --> 13:32.333
How long did Zoey work for you?

13:32.367 --> 13:34.602
Four years. She worked all hours,

13:34.636 --> 13:36.571
and she was loyal to a fault.

13:36.605 --> 13:37.905
Didn't it concern you then

13:37.940 --> 13:39.084
when she didn't show up this morning?

13:39.108 --> 13:40.408
Well, I allow certain employees

13:40.442 --> 13:42.076
to work from home sometimes.

13:42.111 --> 13:44.078
So long as the work gets done,

13:44.113 --> 13:46.414
and Zoey's work always got done.

13:46.448 --> 13:47.982
You know him?

13:48.016 --> 13:52.520
That's her boyfriend.
They were having... issues.

13:52.554 --> 13:54.589
- She looks happy.
- Well, like I said,

13:54.623 --> 13:57.358
she was loyal to a fault.

13:57.392 --> 14:00.361
- Hi, I'm Lara Michaels.
- This is my wife.

14:00.395 --> 14:04.031
I'm the CEO of this company,
and, as I'm sure Kirby told you,

14:04.066 --> 14:07.168
Zoey was one of our
most cherished employees.

14:07.202 --> 14:09.604
So we want to help you
in any way possible.

14:09.638 --> 14:11.672
We're gonna want access
to all of her work emails

14:11.707 --> 14:14.175
- and call logs.
- Whatever you need.

14:14.209 --> 14:16.444
Whoever killed Zoey...

14:22.084 --> 14:25.686
- What's up, man?
- Hey, T.J.

14:25.721 --> 14:28.356
- Your brother here?
- Yeah.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.458
Yo, Dougie.

14:51.513 --> 14:53.414
What up, Rix?

14:53.448 --> 14:56.150
That girl, the one that
got killed in the park.

14:56.185 --> 14:59.720
Come on, man. I'm gonna
kill some jogger lady?

14:59.755 --> 15:03.257
Make it hotter around
here? It's bad for business.

15:04.793 --> 15:06.327
All right, those two guys

15:06.361 --> 15:08.162
hiding in the church, Miles and Jaylen,

15:08.197 --> 15:09.430
they part of your crew?

15:09.464 --> 15:11.732
Man, I seen them shorties
around, but they ain't with us.

15:11.767 --> 15:14.235
Look, man, I'm telling you straight.

15:14.269 --> 15:16.404
All right. Do me a favor.

15:16.438 --> 15:18.506
You hear anything about
who killed that girl,

15:18.540 --> 15:20.775
anything, I want to know.

15:20.809 --> 15:22.577
I'll keep my ears open.

15:22.611 --> 15:24.679
All right.

15:26.448 --> 15:29.183
Gonna be a lot of
eyeballs on this thing.

15:29.218 --> 15:31.085
If I were you, I'd close this store,

15:31.119 --> 15:33.521
I'd pull your guys, lay low
till this thing blows over.

15:33.555 --> 15:36.591
Hey, man, I owe you one, Rix.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.693
You owe me a lot more than one.

15:44.433 --> 15:46.100
Stay behind the line.

15:46.134 --> 15:47.435
Why are you protecting them?

15:47.469 --> 15:50.438
If you don't get them
out of here, we will.

15:50.472 --> 15:54.775
If you cross this line,
you will be arrested.

15:54.810 --> 15:56.644
You will be arrested!

15:56.678 --> 16:00.114
You must stay behind the line.

16:00.148 --> 16:03.551
So, I've been looking into
Zoey's stepfather, Eddie Ryan.

16:03.585 --> 16:06.420
This cat has two priors in
Buffalo for domestic violence.

16:06.455 --> 16:08.723
Let's see if he has an
alibi for this morning.

16:08.757 --> 16:11.759
Hey, you talk to that shot
caller from G-Park Lords?

16:11.793 --> 16:14.228
Yeah, I looked for him,
but he skipped town.

16:14.263 --> 16:15.773
The word on the street
is these boys are clean.

16:15.797 --> 16:17.832
There's no gang affiliations.

16:17.866 --> 16:21.168
I got something. Open case
file on Miles's mother,

16:21.203 --> 16:22.203
Arlene Vincent.

16:22.237 --> 16:24.505
Postal worker, murdered
coming home from work.

16:24.539 --> 16:26.173
No arrests were made, and get this,

16:26.208 --> 16:28.643
it happened exactly one year ago.

16:28.677 --> 16:31.345
You're saying she was
murdered a year ago today?

16:31.380 --> 16:32.757
- Yeah.
- That's why Miles was getting

16:32.781 --> 16:35.182
- drunk in the park.
- Sergeant?

16:35.217 --> 16:38.419
You can speak with the
boys on two conditions.

16:38.453 --> 16:41.289
Inside the church, and no gun.

16:48.664 --> 16:50.531
Excuse the mess. We're in the middle

16:50.565 --> 16:52.633
of the winter clothes drive.

16:52.668 --> 16:55.102
Miles, Jaylen,

16:55.137 --> 16:56.837
this is Sergeant Voight.

16:56.872 --> 16:58.172
Boys.

16:59.675 --> 17:01.776
Man, what, man? We under arrest?

17:01.810 --> 17:03.377
I just want to find out

17:03.412 --> 17:06.180
how a young woman was killed
in Washington Park today.

17:06.214 --> 17:07.258
Well, I don't know nothing about that.

17:07.281 --> 17:10.518
Well, let's talk about
what you do know, okay?

17:13.689 --> 17:16.790
So you got a bottle of
vodka, went to the park.

17:16.825 --> 17:19.327
Jaylen, what happened out there?

17:19.361 --> 17:22.730
We went to the woods, and I got sick.

17:22.763 --> 17:25.398
- From the vodka?
- And then I kinda fell asleep.

17:25.434 --> 17:27.367
The next thing I remember,
Miles said we had to

17:27.402 --> 17:29.303
get our asses outta there.

17:29.338 --> 17:31.806
- Sorry, I didn't mean to swear.
- It's all right.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.841
So, Miles, you were alone?

17:37.579 --> 17:40.381
And you must have been having
some pretty dark thoughts.

17:40.415 --> 17:43.651
I know your mother was
killed a year ago today.

17:45.420 --> 17:47.221
I can't imagine how...

17:47.255 --> 17:49.390
painful that memory is.

17:49.424 --> 17:51.659
So you were drunk.

17:51.693 --> 17:55.262
And you saw that jogger...

17:55.297 --> 17:58.532
Zoey Sims.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.935
- Recognize her?
- No.

18:00.969 --> 18:03.904
See, the thing is about all these parks,

18:03.939 --> 18:06.207
they have cameras.

18:08.977 --> 18:12.346
See, that's you, that's Zoey.

18:12.381 --> 18:14.225
That picture's taken
right before you chased her

18:14.249 --> 18:15.783
in the woods where she was killed.

18:15.817 --> 18:18.452
Come on, man.

18:18.487 --> 18:19.487
Why is that funny?

18:19.521 --> 18:23.524
'Cause... 'cause you think
you know what went down.

18:23.558 --> 18:26.861
- And you don't.
- So help me out.

18:26.895 --> 18:28.929
All right, man, look.

18:28.964 --> 18:31.966
The... the lady dropped her key.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.702
- Her key?
- That's right, man, her key.

18:34.736 --> 18:36.737
And I... and I went
after her to give it back.

18:36.772 --> 18:38.873
Then I had to get my drunk-ass homie.

18:38.907 --> 18:42.810
Father... Father, I swear
to God that's the truth.

18:42.844 --> 18:44.578
If that's all that happened,

18:44.613 --> 18:46.280
why'd you run when the cops showed up?

18:46.314 --> 18:47.281
'Cause I thought y'all were gonna try

18:47.315 --> 18:48.282
and hang something on me.

18:48.316 --> 18:50.551
And... and look, that's
exactly what happened.

18:52.854 --> 18:54.422
All right, everybody out!

18:54.456 --> 18:55.566
Come on, let's get out of here.

18:55.590 --> 18:56.924
No, we can't take them out there!

18:56.958 --> 18:59.393
We have no choice. Come on!

19:04.154 --> 19:06.320
Atwood! Atwood, get over here!

19:06.355 --> 19:10.024
Peterson, form a wedge!
Get these boys to the car.

19:10.058 --> 19:11.559
Come on, come on, come on.

19:11.593 --> 19:13.828
Come on, Father.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.363
Let's go!

19:15.397 --> 19:16.397
Let's go!

19:19.635 --> 19:22.236
It's all right. I got ya.

19:22.271 --> 19:24.205
Come on. Jump in there, jump in there!

19:24.239 --> 19:25.740
All right, here we go.

19:25.774 --> 19:27.608
Keep down! Keep down!

19:27.643 --> 19:29.377
Back away. Back up!

19:29.411 --> 19:31.379
Hey, Sarge.

19:31.413 --> 19:33.748
That's the guy that threw
the cocktail right there.

19:36.285 --> 19:38.419
Go, go! Get out of here! Let's go!

19:38.453 --> 19:41.122
Let's go!

19:41.156 --> 19:43.124
Come on! Everybody, move back!

19:43.158 --> 19:45.693
Stay away from the church!

19:50.432 --> 19:51.699
You don't believe their story.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.401
They haven't been
eliminated as suspects.

19:53.435 --> 19:55.236
Still waiting on the DNA results.

19:55.270 --> 19:56.648
At which point, you'll release them.

19:56.672 --> 19:58.573
No. Hey.

19:58.607 --> 20:00.875
Look, Father, even if
the boys didn't kill Zoey,

20:00.909 --> 20:02.376
and that is a big "if,"

20:02.411 --> 20:04.245
that means the killer's still out there.

20:04.279 --> 20:06.257
And if the killer thinks
we're hanging it on those boys,

20:06.281 --> 20:07.392
maybe he'll let his guard down.

20:07.416 --> 20:10.151
You can't hold them for a
murder they didn't commit.

20:10.185 --> 20:13.588
Father, I will use every
legal tool I've got.

20:13.622 --> 20:15.590
And if the boys have to
spend one night in lock-up

20:15.624 --> 20:18.326
to catch a killer, I can live with that.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.228
Well, I'm staying till they're released.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.330
All right, well, there's
a snack room upstairs.

20:22.364 --> 20:24.565
Let me know if you need quarters.

20:25.701 --> 20:29.570
So you threw a Molotov
cocktail into a church...

20:29.605 --> 20:31.505
in front of a hundred cops?

20:33.942 --> 20:35.687
I'm not sure you really
thought that one through.

20:35.711 --> 20:39.247
Well, I was trying to
do what you wouldn't do,

20:39.281 --> 20:41.282
which is get them out of there.

20:41.316 --> 20:42.683
And it worked.

20:42.718 --> 20:44.485
You got an alibi for this morning?

20:44.519 --> 20:46.487
You got the guys that
did this, thanks to me,

20:46.521 --> 20:48.256
so how about a thank you?

20:48.290 --> 20:49.868
Travis, we know that you and
Zoey were having problems,

20:49.892 --> 20:51.926
and now we know you
got a violent temper.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.438
I don't know. Maybe you threw the bomb

20:53.462 --> 20:55.696
to throw attention to the black boys.

20:55.731 --> 20:57.865
All right, you guys
are a couple of clowns.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.210
- Sit down.
- That's the second time

20:59.234 --> 21:00.501
you've jerked me around.

21:00.535 --> 21:03.604
I'm not gonna ask you to sit down again.

21:07.843 --> 21:09.810
One last time.

21:09.845 --> 21:14.215
Who can vouch that you were
home when Zoey was killed?

21:14.249 --> 21:17.318
No one.

21:17.352 --> 21:20.488
Well, then, you got a problem, slick.

21:20.522 --> 21:24.325
Yeah. We got Zoey's
landlord to let us inside.

21:24.359 --> 21:25.693
We'll loop you in.

21:25.727 --> 21:27.361
I can't believe this happened.

21:28.931 --> 21:30.498
Zoey just moved in.

21:30.532 --> 21:31.676
Anything you can tell us about her?

21:31.700 --> 21:33.200
I really didn't know her that well.

21:33.235 --> 21:35.836
She had good references
on her application.

21:35.871 --> 21:38.306
You said you have the
apartment next door, right?

21:38.340 --> 21:39.807
You ever see her with anybody?

21:39.841 --> 21:42.543
Sometimes. Her boyfriend.

21:42.577 --> 21:44.512
- He was here this morning.
- You saw him?

21:44.546 --> 21:46.981
I didn't. I heard them at first.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.984
They were having an
argument. Thin walls.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.753
- I saw them leave.
- This him?

21:52.788 --> 21:54.588
- No.
- You sure?

21:54.623 --> 21:57.892
Yeah. Zoey's boyfriend
is much more put together.

21:57.926 --> 22:00.361
He's a suit type of guy.

22:00.395 --> 22:03.364
Like, um...

22:03.398 --> 22:05.333
- like this guy?
- Yes.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.401
That's who she was with.

22:10.405 --> 22:12.373
I don't understand what I can add.

22:12.407 --> 22:14.909
Didn't you catch Zoey's
killers in the church?

22:14.943 --> 22:16.387
Problem with those guys
is they don't even have

22:16.411 --> 22:17.912
a motive for killing Zoey.

22:17.946 --> 22:19.680
Well, maybe they don't need a motive.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.449
Maybe they're animals.

22:21.483 --> 22:26.420
Did your wife know you were
having an affair with Zoey Sims?

22:27.656 --> 22:28.522
I'll take that as a no.

22:28.557 --> 22:31.625
How long were you sleeping with Zoey?

22:31.660 --> 22:35.629
Look. Me and Zoey?

22:35.664 --> 22:37.531
It wasn't serious.

22:37.566 --> 22:40.634
Now, Kirby, a guy having an affair

22:40.669 --> 22:43.270
with an employee in a
company owned by his wife.

22:43.305 --> 22:45.573
Now there's a motive.

22:45.607 --> 22:47.541
You gotta be kidding.

22:47.576 --> 22:50.478
The landlord heard you arguing
with Zoey and saw you leave.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.938
It's true. I wanted to break it
off and... and Zoey got upset.

22:53.972 --> 22:54.872
She threatened to tell your wife.

22:54.906 --> 22:57.107
- You wanted to keep her quiet.
- No, no.

22:57.142 --> 22:59.743
It... it was an argument.
Between two adults.

22:59.778 --> 23:02.246
I mean, that's all we
were, two consenting adults.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.681
That's not against the law.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.683
After your argument, Zoey went jogging.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.750
Where did you go?

23:06.785 --> 23:09.486
I was in a logistics
meeting at the Public Hotel.

23:09.521 --> 23:12.122
I swear. And there's ten
people who can verify that.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.959
Wh... screw it. Call my wife.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.127
I had an affair with this woman.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.163
But I didn't kill her.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.802
Well, I checked Kirby Michael's alibi.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.937
He was in a meeting at
the time of Zoey's murder.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.472
Anything on the stepfather?

23:28.506 --> 23:29.717
No, Eddie Ryan's airtight, boss.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.786
Three people put him at work
at the time of Zoey's murder.

23:31.810 --> 23:35.479
Violent stepfather, crazy
boyfriend, sleazy boss.

23:35.513 --> 23:37.615
Zoey sure had some winners in her life.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.984
And the M.E. just finished
the DNA test on Zoey.

23:40.018 --> 23:41.986
There's no match for Miles or Jaylen.

23:42.020 --> 23:44.688
So a day into this, and we're
right back where we started.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.156
Throw a wider net.

23:46.191 --> 23:49.693
Go knock on doors.
Talk to everyone again.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.062
All right, check this out.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.131
So Zoey stretches for about a minute

23:54.165 --> 23:56.066
before her jog, right?

23:56.101 --> 23:59.703
And then if you freeze the image...

23:59.738 --> 24:01.839
- right there.
- She's looking at something.

24:01.873 --> 24:03.641
Yeah.

24:03.675 --> 24:05.319
Do we have other angles
from this part of the park?

24:05.343 --> 24:07.544
No, unfortunately.

24:09.547 --> 24:11.615
What is she looking at?

24:14.786 --> 24:19.256
So Zoey took this path into the park.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.692
She stopped here to stretch.

24:23.895 --> 24:26.664
And she looks over her shoulder.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.732
She sees something in
the woods back there.

24:28.767 --> 24:32.569
Or someone.

24:32.604 --> 24:36.106
Who was hiding here?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.142
- Bingo.
- What?

24:39.744 --> 24:42.579
They got cameras in those birdhouses.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.088
Someone in there.

24:55.260 --> 24:58.028
I know that guy.

24:58.063 --> 25:01.298
Yeah. He's the park
worker who put the two boys

25:01.333 --> 25:03.934
at the scene of the murder.

25:03.968 --> 25:05.903
- Russell Tillman.
- Ping his phone.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.705
The number he gave me is out of service,

25:07.739 --> 25:09.807
but I got an address off his license.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.809
3942 Wyoming Street.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.778
Get a warrant. Let's hit it.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.235
- Clear.
- Clear.

25:38.269 --> 25:39.770
Clear!

25:39.804 --> 25:41.315
All right, we're all
clear, Al, come on in.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.941
Hey, Sarge, you're
gonna want to see this.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.174
So this is the guy you got
the witness statement from?

26:07.198 --> 26:09.733
Russell Tillman? He was white.

26:09.767 --> 26:12.636
Yo, Sarge, all these
magazines are subscriptions

26:12.670 --> 26:15.372
to a John Gleason, but
they're sent to this address.

26:15.406 --> 26:18.408
Yeah, these are utility
bills in John Gleason's name,

26:18.443 --> 26:20.488
but there's other mail here
too going to Russell Tillman.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.312
This is a pay stub from
the Parks Department.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.314
Maybe they were roommates.
Had a falling out.

26:26.584 --> 26:30.153
Guys, all this food here is fresh.

26:30.188 --> 26:31.588
It's like Goldilocks just left.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.191
Yeah, maybe not.

26:34.225 --> 26:36.660
Erin, get these plates
to forensics for prints.

26:36.694 --> 26:38.195
You're gonna bed down here.

26:38.229 --> 26:41.431
I want eyes inside and outside.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.333
If Tillman doesn't know we're on to him,

26:43.368 --> 26:45.502
he just might come home.

26:54.245 --> 26:56.013
A place like this is the exact reason

26:56.047 --> 26:57.614
I've never been on Tinder.

26:57.649 --> 26:59.182
Well, let me, get this straight.

26:59.217 --> 27:02.619
You called Tillman to follow
up on a witness statement?

27:02.654 --> 27:05.722
Correct. But the number
was out of service.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.591
And that didn't raise a red flag?

27:07.625 --> 27:11.728
No, I just... I... I thought
I wrote the number down wrong.

27:14.098 --> 27:16.033
Al, come on. I was gonna chase it,

27:16.067 --> 27:17.111
but then something else jumped off.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.437
You don't leave... something
like that for later.

27:20.471 --> 27:23.407
Would you... I thought
it was my mistake.

27:24.776 --> 27:26.710
It was.

27:28.513 --> 27:31.648
Hank, we got a fingerprint
off the dirty coffee cup.

27:31.683 --> 27:33.550
It's a match for Russell Tillman.

27:33.585 --> 27:36.486
He's got a few priors
all across the south.

27:36.521 --> 27:38.488
Animal cruelty, indecent exposure.

27:38.523 --> 27:40.557
He was arrested for
a peeping Tom in Texas

27:40.592 --> 27:42.392
and did three months
in a psych ward there.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.394
- Drifter.
- Well, the head in the freezer

27:44.429 --> 27:45.596
belongs to John Gleason.

27:45.630 --> 27:46.874
He's also the owner of the house.

27:46.898 --> 27:49.633
Sanitation worker, retired with
full disability five years ago.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.501
Now he only has one living relative.

27:51.536 --> 27:52.769
It's a sister in St. Louis.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.237
The last time they spoke,

27:54.272 --> 27:55.382
he told her that he took on a boarder.

27:55.406 --> 27:58.141
He rented a room to Russell
Tillman, who killed him.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.345
Now it looks like Tillman kept
cashing the disability checks.

28:01.379 --> 28:03.280
The last one was cashed at a BofA

28:03.314 --> 28:04.491
on 40th Street ten minutes ago.

28:04.515 --> 28:05.759
It's right near Gleason's house.

28:05.783 --> 28:08.251
All right, does Gleason have
a car registered in his name?

28:08.286 --> 28:11.421
Yes, he does. 2005 red Silverado.

28:11.456 --> 28:13.357
Hey, Sarge, you gotta hear this.

28:13.391 --> 28:16.660
Sergeant Voight, you've
had the boys for 24 hours.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.261
If you don't release them,

28:18.296 --> 28:19.506
I'm gonna bring the press up here.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.765
Father, we're on to something.

28:21.799 --> 28:23.667
I'm asking you to give
us a little more time.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.769
Please.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.682
There's a red Silverado just passing.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.627
Tillman just got here.

28:50.662 --> 28:53.664
Yep, copy that. Alerting
tact team right now.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.371
Is he coming?

29:01.406 --> 29:03.173
No.

29:03.207 --> 29:07.177
No, he's just... staying in his truck.

29:08.846 --> 29:10.647
Come on.

29:14.719 --> 29:15.952
He made us.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.525
CPD! Stop your car!

29:36.407 --> 29:38.709
Continuing westbound!
Continuing westbound!

29:40.945 --> 29:42.212
Move.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.219
Got him, got him, got him!

30:09.574 --> 30:11.374
Just turned north on Western!

30:24.689 --> 30:26.289
We lost him going north on Western.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.924
<i>Yeah, we're on it.</i>

30:32.630 --> 30:34.698
There, there, there, go!

30:47.011 --> 30:49.279
Slow down, slow down.

31:00.558 --> 31:02.659
- Clear.
- Clear.

31:03.828 --> 31:05.929
We found the truck
abandoned at Dan Ryan Wood.

31:05.963 --> 31:07.697
Suspect fled on foot, we are in pursuit.

31:07.732 --> 31:08.932
<i>Copy that.</i>

31:45.703 --> 31:47.971
Stay down! I said stay down!

31:48.005 --> 31:50.640
She broke my arm!

31:50.675 --> 31:52.676
I'll break the other one.

31:56.100 --> 31:59.300
I figured nobody would believe
my story in a million years,

31:59.501 --> 32:03.704
so I got rid of the body piece by piece.

32:03.738 --> 32:06.306
And you just... you kept the head

32:06.341 --> 32:09.176
and the hands as souvenirs.

32:09.210 --> 32:13.313
Fingerprints and teeth.

32:13.348 --> 32:17.317
It's the parts they can trace you with.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.854
It was... it was justified.

32:20.889 --> 32:23.891
All you can get me for is
unlawful disposal of body parts,

32:23.925 --> 32:27.861
but I... I had nothing
to do with that girl.

32:30.965 --> 32:34.435
You know what I think?

32:34.469 --> 32:37.337
I think... I think
you've had these urges

32:37.372 --> 32:39.940
for a long, long time.

32:39.974 --> 32:42.509
And you've resisted them.

32:42.544 --> 32:48.248
But when this thing with
your roommate went down,

32:48.283 --> 32:53.187
something shifted for you.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.589
I told you, it was those two black kids.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.927
Okay.

33:02.330 --> 33:04.698
I've been a cop,

33:04.733 --> 33:07.234
well, a lot of years.

33:08.937 --> 33:12.973
There's one thing I hate.

33:13.007 --> 33:16.710
I mean, I hate it when people blame

33:16.745 --> 33:19.713
the black kid.

33:19.748 --> 33:23.817
I get it all the time.

33:23.852 --> 33:26.653
I'll tell you something.

33:26.688 --> 33:30.557
Please believe me
when I tell you that...

33:30.592 --> 33:32.993
it's not gonna happen today.

33:33.027 --> 33:34.962
'Cause you're gonna tell me

33:34.996 --> 33:37.464
the truth about what really happened.

33:37.499 --> 33:39.266
I need medical attention.

33:39.300 --> 33:40.734
Don't look at me.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.603
It's your shoulder, right? Like this?

33:48.042 --> 33:50.844
You opened an old wound in this city.

33:50.879 --> 33:55.315
Church got burned.

33:55.350 --> 33:57.985
So you're gonna come off your story,

33:58.019 --> 34:00.788
and you're gonna tell
me what happened...

34:00.822 --> 34:02.990
in this room, today, right now.

34:07.495 --> 34:10.697
You...

34:10.732 --> 34:13.934
you're right.

34:13.967 --> 34:17.337
I...

34:17.371 --> 34:19.940
I've had these...

34:19.974 --> 34:22.309
I've had these feelings
since I was born.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.482
I've struggled and I've prayed.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.322
I had a five-second rule.

34:35.356 --> 34:38.958
Five-second rule.

34:38.993 --> 34:42.295
Whenever I saw a woman, I would...

34:42.330 --> 34:44.630
start feeling...

34:44.666 --> 34:47.501
that way and...

34:47.534 --> 34:51.672
I forced myself to look
away after five seconds.

34:53.675 --> 34:57.311
But when... when I saw her
in the park yesterday...

35:00.782 --> 35:02.850
What was the point?

35:02.884 --> 35:04.685
You guys were just gonna

35:04.719 --> 35:07.821
arrest me for Gleason, eventually.

35:12.794 --> 35:15.863
Why deny myself?

35:17.565 --> 35:19.333
And you know something?

35:22.036 --> 35:25.839
It was everything I
could have hoped for...

35:25.874 --> 35:27.908
and more.

35:49.130 --> 35:51.899
Miles,

35:51.933 --> 35:54.768
Jaylen, you're free to go.

35:54.802 --> 35:57.738
So, we just get to walk out?

35:57.772 --> 35:59.873
Just... just like that?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.942
Just like that.

36:03.778 --> 36:06.813
And I'm sorry.

36:06.848 --> 36:08.548
Come on, let's go.

36:14.022 --> 36:17.724
Hey, hold on, hold on.

36:17.759 --> 36:20.727
Did y'all catch the guy who
killed the lady in the park?

36:20.762 --> 36:22.496
We did.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.598
I'm glad.

36:30.705 --> 36:32.773
- Bill.
- Hank.

36:37.679 --> 36:40.414
- Come on in.
- You wanted to talk to me?

36:40.448 --> 36:43.617
Yeah.

36:43.651 --> 36:47.955
I also know people in South Wash.

36:47.989 --> 36:51.058
I know you talked to Little Dougie.

36:53.828 --> 36:57.197
Yeah. Yeah, I questioned him.

36:57.231 --> 36:59.132
He gave us the information we needed.

36:59.167 --> 37:00.934
The kids had no gang affiliation.

37:00.969 --> 37:02.869
There was nothing else to chase, so...

37:02.904 --> 37:06.106
Why'd you lie about it?

37:06.140 --> 37:08.775
I put a dozen bad guys in
jail thanks to the intel

37:08.810 --> 37:10.177
that Dougie gave me.

37:10.211 --> 37:13.480
I just want to leave his name out of it.

37:13.514 --> 37:15.025
Look, Kenny, I brought
you here for a reason,

37:15.049 --> 37:18.118
and you're doing great so far.

37:18.152 --> 37:23.023
I even expected a little turbulence.

37:23.057 --> 37:26.626
But if you ever withhold
information from me again,

37:26.661 --> 37:28.762
I will bounce your
ass right out of here.

37:50.785 --> 37:52.819
Night, Al.

38:10.605 --> 38:12.672
What?

38:18.279 --> 38:20.547
Thanks, partner.

38:22.583 --> 38:24.651
Yeah, no problem.

38:28.956 --> 38:30.757
So before anyone leaves,

38:30.792 --> 38:33.527
we're taking donations to
help rebuild the church.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.028
Okay, how much we need?

38:35.063 --> 38:38.532
About 5 grand.
That's just materials.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.600
Got a long way to go.

38:40.635 --> 38:43.703
Yeah, so dig deep. It's for the church.

39:21.876 --> 39:24.778
One man's trash is
another man's treasure.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.749
Detective Olinsky, I
was hoping to see you.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.917
Amazing, isn't it?

39:30.952 --> 39:33.920
Sometimes it takes a crisis
to bring people together.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.288
Help us to heal.

39:35.323 --> 39:37.157
I'm just dropping off the beer.

39:43.831 --> 39:45.932
But y'all feel what I'm saying, right?

39:45.967 --> 39:47.344
I understand, but
listen, you don't gotta

39:47.368 --> 39:49.213
look at me like that.
I've run from cops before.

39:49.237 --> 39:50.971
It's okay. I just did it last week.

39:51.005 --> 39:53.206
I was at the 7-Eleven,
and I was, you know,

39:53.241 --> 39:54.341
buying stuff for the house.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.943
Naturally, that's where black
people get our groceries.

39:59.147 --> 40:02.015
I hear the squad car pull
up, I heard it pull up.

40:02.049 --> 40:02.949
I get terrified.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.951
First thing I do is
run right out the door

40:04.986 --> 40:05.952
and I'm down the street.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.220
Took me about, you know,

40:07.255 --> 40:09.156
30 seconds before I hit myself and said,

40:09.190 --> 40:12.826
"Why the hell am I running?
I'm the damn police."

40:14.762 --> 40:17.898
"Hell, I didn't do nothing."

40:17.932 --> 40:20.300
Man, but one day...

40:20.334 --> 40:22.802
one day it ain't gonna be like that.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.971
For any of us.

40:25.006 --> 40:28.008
I just hope I'm around to see it.
