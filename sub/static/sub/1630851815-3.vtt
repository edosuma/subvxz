WEBVTT

00:08.750 --> 00:10.666
Let me tell you something.

00:10.750 --> 00:14.333
In Black Reconstruction,
when writing about the commonalities

00:14.416 --> 00:19.708
between working-class Blacks and whites,
W.E.B. Du Bois wrote...

00:19.791 --> 00:23.833
The white laborers,
while they received a low wage,

00:23.916 --> 00:28.625
were compensated in part
by a public and psychological wage.

00:28.708 --> 00:31.958
They were given public deference
and titles of courtesy

00:32.041 --> 00:33.583
because they were white.

00:34.875 --> 00:38.083
White laborers were admitted freely
with all classes of white people

00:38.166 --> 00:39.791
to public functions,

00:39.875 --> 00:42.625
public parks, and the best schools.

00:42.708 --> 00:45.416
The police were drawn from their ranks,

00:45.500 --> 00:49.166
and the courts, dependent on their votes,
treated them with such leniency

00:49.250 --> 00:51.166
as to encourage lawlessness.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.875
Cadet officers learn
how a group of men working as one

00:54.958 --> 00:58.125
can be an effective wedge
between destructive mobs

00:58.208 --> 01:00.750
and the peaceful citizen and his property.

01:01.541 --> 01:05.541
You know what we call that now?
Same thing it was then.

01:05.625 --> 01:07.041
White privilege.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.958
Growing up with white parents,

01:10.041 --> 01:13.416
I moved through life
with their audacity of whiteness.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.541
I assumed their privilege was mine.
I was in for a rude awakening.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.666
Backlash is growing
against Colin Kaepernick

01:22.750 --> 01:25.750
after the 49ers quarterback
refused to stand

01:25.833 --> 01:28.708
during the national anthem at a game
played last Friday.

01:28.791 --> 01:32.041
Who knows what Kaepernick thinks
or why he's so unhappy?

01:32.125 --> 01:33.958
Colin, here's my salute to you.

01:36.666 --> 01:39.333
Not standing up
for "The Star-Spangled Banner"

01:39.416 --> 01:41.083
is the wrong way to protest.

01:41.166 --> 01:46.791
Get that son of a bitch off the field
right now. Out. He's fired. He's fired!

01:48.500 --> 01:50.833
This is an attack on the country.

01:52.333 --> 01:55.500
He's un-American, and he doesn't
deserve to be in our country.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.958
All Whites Matter.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.750
But way before that,
right before my junior year,

02:02.833 --> 02:05.791
I still had a lot to learn
about the way the world works.

02:05.875 --> 02:09.083
It's a screen and Green
is able to cut back and pick up nine

02:09.166 --> 02:12.291
-and is right there to recover it.
-Oh!

02:12.375 --> 02:13.416
Butterfingers.

02:14.041 --> 02:15.916
Better hit the sack, Colin.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.875
You have to pitch seven innings
in Palmdale in the morning.

02:19.958 --> 02:24.125
-Can we at least finish the game?
-No. You won't wanna get up.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.208
You too, Rick.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.500
Okay, almost done.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.375
I've got directions mapped out

02:28.458 --> 02:31.041
for every tournament
for the next five weekends.

02:31.125 --> 02:34.333
Dad, we should probably get
one of those, um, GPS things

02:34.416 --> 02:35.833
-for the minivan, right?
-Mm.

02:35.916 --> 02:39.541
Why would I rely on something
that malfunctions if it's cloudy

02:39.625 --> 02:41.708
when I can just rely on this?

02:42.291 --> 02:47.083
Because it won't get us lost
for four hours in Arcata.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.583
Jeez, come on, I get lost one time--

02:49.666 --> 02:52.416
-No! Excuse me. Flagstaff.
-Okay, well--

02:52.500 --> 02:54.000
-Boulder City!
-Medford.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.833
Okay, okay, okay.

02:56.625 --> 03:00.375
-I mean, Boulder City was very foggy.
-What?

03:00.458 --> 03:02.958
And he said, "Take a left at the Walmart."

03:03.041 --> 03:05.083
-No! Ugh!
-There was no Walmart.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.458
Rise and shine! It's game day.

03:19.333 --> 03:24.125
While being a quarterback was
definitely my plan, I loved baseball too.

03:24.208 --> 03:28.166
It was another way to show the world
the kind of athlete I could be.

03:31.916 --> 03:32.750
Good morning.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.416
-How's that arm?
-Ooh, like ten or 11 strikeouts.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.875
-That's what I'm talking about!
-Whoo! Psych!

03:39.875 --> 03:43.583
-You're in a good mood.
-Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? Life's good.

03:43.666 --> 03:47.375
What would make life even better
is if you shave the fuzz off that lip.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.500
You gotta be clean-shaven to play
for the Yankees. That's a rule.

03:50.583 --> 03:53.000
Oh, man. That's why I'm a Brewers fan.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.416
I knew I liked you.

03:54.958 --> 03:56.000
Ooh.

03:56.916 --> 03:58.833
-What is this?
-It's a frittata.

03:59.791 --> 04:02.166
-A fri-what?
-A frittata.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.416
I don't know what it is,
but I'm down for anything today.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.666
Mm.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.208
Mm. Mm.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.125
Mm. Mm.

04:18.208 --> 04:22.166
No, don't drown it--
You won't be able to taste the spices.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.000
It's great.
It just needs a little ketchup.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.458
You've done it again.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.041
Mm.

04:36.541 --> 04:39.583
-Can we change the music?
-Driver's choice.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.416
Anything interesting?

04:44.500 --> 04:47.833
President Bush
is just doing his best to keep us safe.

04:48.416 --> 04:50.416
Protect us from all those terrorists.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.041
-Yeah, good for him.
-Yeah.

04:54.083 --> 04:57.000
Can we turn down the air please?
It's freezing.

04:57.083 --> 05:00.750
No, we can't.
But next time you can bring a jacket.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.083
Damn. You gonna eat the whole cup?

05:22.166 --> 05:23.916
Maybe. And the stick too.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.708
Oh, shit. It's time for my second round.

05:28.291 --> 05:29.208
Let's get it.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.250
-Hi. Thank you.
-Okay.

05:35.750 --> 05:36.916
Thank you.

05:44.708 --> 05:45.791
Awesome.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.958
Hi. Can I have an ice cream, please?

05:50.041 --> 05:51.916
Sorry, gave you one already.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.250
Oh, but everybody got one already.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.500
I'm not sure about everybody.
I'm sure you did, though.

06:05.208 --> 06:06.250
Hey.

06:07.916 --> 06:11.000
-Where's your ice cream?
-She said I already had one.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.791
What? Everybody already got one.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.875
Hold on, I'll be right back.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.583
No, no, it's cool, I--

06:19.666 --> 06:23.833
No, I'm not getting one for you.
I'm getting my second second.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.541
Like I said, no idea how it worked.

06:35.708 --> 06:37.333
Not yet, anyway.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.041
Thank you.

06:53.333 --> 06:56.458
At least on the field,
I knew what the rules were,

06:56.541 --> 06:59.208
-and I knew what I was doing.
-Let's go, boys. Let's play.

07:03.958 --> 07:05.291
Strike!

07:06.750 --> 07:07.583
Come on!

07:08.166 --> 07:10.875
Oh, that is a generous strike zone.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.750
-Come on, Jake.
-Come on. Come on. You got it.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.875
Let's go, kid!

07:14.958 --> 07:17.083
-Strike!
-You kidding me?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.333
-Come on, ump!
-Good, David.

07:20.416 --> 07:21.875
-Good.
-Good eye, Jake.

07:21.958 --> 07:24.458
Big strike right now!
Big strike right now!

07:25.583 --> 07:28.208
-Strike three. You're out.
-Are you serious?

07:28.291 --> 07:29.416
You need to cool off, son.

07:30.125 --> 07:33.791
-Damn it! Kidding me! Come on!
-It's all right. It's all right.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.000
The ump was making some bad calls.

07:36.083 --> 07:38.250
-But Jake's reaction was a bit much.
-Come on!

07:38.333 --> 07:39.583
Let's go, Kaepernick!

07:39.666 --> 07:40.791
Whoo!

07:41.375 --> 07:42.375
I wasn't worried.

07:42.458 --> 07:46.958
All I needed was a halfway decent pitch
to knock one out of the park.

07:47.708 --> 07:48.541
Strike!

07:48.625 --> 07:49.791
-Come on!
-Come on, ump!

07:49.875 --> 07:52.625
-You see? Can you believe it?
-Somebody forgot his glasses.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.750
-Good eye, Colin.
-You got this.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.958
-Colin, hit the ball.
-Colin, Colin.

07:58.041 --> 07:59.208
Strike!

08:00.125 --> 08:03.458
-Open your eyes, ump!
-You got this. You got it!

08:03.541 --> 08:05.208
-Let's go, Kap.
-Come on.

08:05.291 --> 08:08.083
-He ain't got nothing on you.
-Play smart.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.000
-You got this.
-Come on, Colin.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.458
You got this!

08:11.541 --> 08:12.500
Let's go, Colin!

08:15.625 --> 08:16.541
Strike!

08:18.125 --> 08:19.125
Ridiculous.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.708
Hey, watch your tone,
or you'll be sitting in the locker room.

08:23.333 --> 08:28.083
At that moment, I'm wondering
why Jake got a pass, and I got scolded.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.833
Colin's gonna have
to watch that mouth of his.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.291
You're right about that.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.208
Let's do this.

08:52.916 --> 08:54.541
Thursday, a night game.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.250
How's that arm feeling?

08:59.083 --> 08:59.916
Strong.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.833
That mustache.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.041
I don't like it.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.166
I think I look sexy.

09:14.791 --> 09:16.875
Oh, my ribs.

09:18.666 --> 09:20.375
Can we turn on the air, please?

09:20.458 --> 09:22.000
No, sir. I cannot.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.666
-Can we turn down the music?
-Nope. Driver's choice.

09:36.708 --> 09:41.750
-We're gonna hit the pool. You wanna come?
-Yeah, sure. Let me get checked in first.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.916
-Where'd you get that cookie from?
-Yo, these shits are the bomb.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.541
-And they're still warm too.
-A'ight.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.958
-I'll see you there.
-Catch you outside.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.750
Thank you very much. Enjoy your stay.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.916
-Can I get a dollar? I want a water.
-All right, a dollar.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.291
Excuse me. Can I help you?

10:12.041 --> 10:14.250
I'm sorry. Is this man bothering you?

10:14.333 --> 10:17.958
He is, but there's not much we can do
about it. He's our son.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.000
Okay.

10:21.541 --> 10:22.666
Wow.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.583
Adopted.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.250
Of course.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.833
My church has a foster kids program.

10:28.916 --> 10:31.291
I think about getting one all the time.

10:33.291 --> 10:37.291
-What country did he come from?
-Good ol' Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.208
Bless your hearts.

10:39.291 --> 10:40.916
Doing the Lord's work.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.291
-Let me know if you need anything at all.
-Oh.

10:44.375 --> 10:45.208
All right.

10:46.041 --> 10:48.083
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.625
Oh, well, she was sweet.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.416
Hokkaido is the second largest...

10:56.500 --> 10:57.708
Going to the pool with Jake?

10:57.791 --> 11:00.666
...and provides the route
to a spectacular...

11:00.750 --> 11:02.333
You wanna head to the field early?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.208
What's wrong with you?

11:09.833 --> 11:12.458
-Nothing.
-Yeah? Doesn't seem like nothing.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.625
That lady downstairs.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.166
She just rolls up on me
and jabs me in the back.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.958
And for what? For nothing.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.958
You're talking about the manager.

11:29.583 --> 11:30.416
Yeah.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.083
What was that about?

11:33.166 --> 11:34.875
She thought you were a vagrant.

11:34.958 --> 11:37.291
I told you
you should have shaved that thing.

11:43.041 --> 11:46.375
-That really what's bothering you?
-I don't know.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.583
Sometimes I just feel...

11:54.250 --> 11:55.750
uncomfortable.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.750
I don't think anyone's trying
to make you feel that way.

12:00.583 --> 12:03.083
But when you do, just say something.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.791
You can always talk to me,
but you have to talk to me.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.583
What is that supposed to mean?

12:08.666 --> 12:12.916
It means you always keep
your feelings to yourself, Colin.

12:13.666 --> 12:18.916
Talk to me and know
there's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.791
-Hold still. It'll all be over soon.
-Dad. No. Mom!

12:27.875 --> 12:28.958
-Mom.
-Son.

12:29.041 --> 12:33.291
-Sorry. She can't protect you this time.
-Knock it off. For Pete's sake.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.000
Jeez, okay. I was just kidding around.

12:41.666 --> 12:45.666
Rise and shine! It's game day!

12:48.750 --> 12:49.875
Whoo!

12:58.916 --> 13:03.375
Hey, buddy, if you're cold back there,
maybe this hot jam will heat you up.

13:38.583 --> 13:43.375
Yo, tonight is gonna be sick.
Annie's twin sisters are coming.

13:43.458 --> 13:47.416
They're identical, but Irene's boobs
are definitely bigger, hundred percent.

13:49.041 --> 13:51.458
-Here we go again.
-What's up?

13:51.541 --> 13:56.000
No, these hotel people stare at me
like I pulled up in a UFO or something.

13:57.791 --> 14:00.083
You're a big Black dude
in Whitey Whiteville, man.

14:00.166 --> 14:04.250
-What do you expect?
-No, but it happens all the time now.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.291
Maybe 'cause you grew 50 feet this year.
That could be the problem.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.916
Oh, okay, so now it's
against the law to be tall, like...

14:11.583 --> 14:14.208
Man, I feel like wearing a sign
when we travel saying,

14:14.291 --> 14:16.958
"Yes, I'm adopted.
Yes, these are my parents.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.458
No, I'm not a panhandler
asking white people for money

14:19.541 --> 14:20.750
or trying to get free apples."

14:23.291 --> 14:25.250
I have a quick question, ma'am.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.791
It's starting to get on my nerves.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.708
Shit. They're lucky I'm not Black.
I'd toss this place up.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.333
-Oh, yeah. That right?
-Hell yeah.

14:33.416 --> 14:36.875
-Why are you telling me? Tell them.
-Shit. They don't want none of this, bro.

14:36.958 --> 14:38.166
You know my temper.

14:39.833 --> 14:43.208
Don't let it get to you, Colin.
All right? Let's go chill.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.166
-I'll catch up with you later.
-All right.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.000
Set, hike.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.416
Yo, yo, speech, speech!

15:12.500 --> 15:15.583
I just wanna thank everyone.
Maybe it's time for me to call it quits.

15:16.166 --> 15:20.500
I'm gonna go into retirement,
after being MVP for seven years straight.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.291
I got my money, right, y'all?

15:22.375 --> 15:24.791
Hey! Get off the table!
Turn off that music!

15:24.875 --> 15:26.625
All of you, get out of here.

15:30.583 --> 15:33.833
-Are you a guest here?
-You know I am.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.458
-You saw me in the lobby earlier.
-Room number?

15:38.291 --> 15:40.916
-I don't know.
-You don't know your room number?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.166
I haven't been to the room yet.
My parents--

15:43.250 --> 15:44.208
Show me your key.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.958
Ma'am, I just told you.
My parents checked in for me.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.750
-I don't know what room I'm in.
-Right. Okay, let's go.

15:49.833 --> 15:50.875
-Yo.
-Hey, don't.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.916
Leave him alone. He's with his parents.
He's on our baseball team.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah, man.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.000
Get out of here now, all of you.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.541
-Come on.
-Let's go.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.833
-Let's go, dude.
-Lucky I don't call the police.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.416
Microaggressions.

16:05.500 --> 16:09.500
A term coined
by Black psychiatrist Chester M. Pierce,

16:09.583 --> 16:12.583
who played football at Harvard,
by the way.

16:17.125 --> 16:21.750
It refers to small behavioral indignities,
intentional or not,

16:22.375 --> 16:25.250
that communicate derogatory racial insults

16:25.750 --> 16:30.250
that leave us feeling degraded,
dehumanized, and offended.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.083
Welcome to the firm.

16:34.958 --> 16:39.500
It's so nice to finally meet you.
I've been hearing great things about you.

16:39.583 --> 16:43.333
-Thank you. It's a great opportunity.
-It was a no-brainer.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.000
Your résumé is impeccable.

16:45.083 --> 16:50.125
I mean, you're articulate,
bright, nice, and, uh, clean.

16:50.208 --> 16:54.041
Let's stop right there.
Y'all see what he did there, right, folks?

16:54.125 --> 16:57.750
-That was a classic microaggression.
-Bright, nice, and, uh, clean.

16:57.833 --> 17:01.250
-Let's see what kind of reaction it gets.
-Appreciate it.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.500
Oh, very nice deflection.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.416
When a white person calls
a Black person clean,

17:07.500 --> 17:10.875
he's basically admitting that he thinks
all Black people are animals.

17:10.958 --> 17:14.833
When he sees a Black person is
well-dressed, he thinks it's an anomaly.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.916
It isn't.
Let's see what happens in the second half.

17:18.958 --> 17:22.833
No one told me that you had
such, um, interesting hair.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.791
It's very unique.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.291
Is that the style now?

17:27.375 --> 17:29.666
Oh, boy. All right. Another classic.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.416
What he's really saying is
even though it scares him,

17:32.500 --> 17:34.791
he'd really like to touch his head.

17:34.875 --> 17:38.375
Yeah, you know, it is a style, I guess.

17:38.458 --> 17:43.125
Ha. A style that dates back 3600 years.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.458
Someone doesn't have any Black friends.

17:45.541 --> 17:48.000
Will you be wearing it
to the office this way?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.833
Again with the hair? Huh.

17:49.916 --> 17:52.291
Well, he is tenacious.
I gotta give him that.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.791
Let's see how he responds.

17:53.875 --> 17:57.875
You know this is how I wear my hair.
Sometimes it gets long and I tie it up.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.625
Is that gonna be a problem?

17:59.708 --> 18:02.291
Oh, let's look at that again.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Perfect delivery, non-threatening.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.000
But we know he's a lawyer too,

18:07.083 --> 18:10.958
and he will sue his ass
'cause there are CROWN laws in the state.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.666
Just beautiful.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.625
-That gonna be a problem?
-No. No problem at all.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.041
Look forward to getting
to know you, young man.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.833
I think you're going to fit in just fine.

18:21.916 --> 18:24.791
And there's the handshake.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.083
I look forward
to getting to know you too, sir.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.750
That's gotta feel good.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.666
In a few years,
he'll probably make partner.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.291
And after that, who knows?

18:34.041 --> 18:36.958
He should probably delete
his tweet about All Lives Matter.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.625
He should also probably delete
his tweet about All Lives Matter.

18:46.791 --> 18:48.416
Rise and--

18:50.791 --> 18:52.833
Colin? Get up.

18:53.916 --> 18:55.250
It's game day.

19:06.291 --> 19:09.833
-Hey, bud. How's that arm feeling?
-Same as the last time you asked me.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.083
Okay, you're in a mood. Let's get
some food in you to cheer you up.

19:13.166 --> 19:16.041
-I'm not hungry.
-I didn't have time to cook.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.166
Okay, eat something anyway.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.375
Hey, hey.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.666
Your dad and I were talking,

19:28.750 --> 19:32.458
and since you're going
for your driver's license soon,

19:33.000 --> 19:37.791
we thought maybe you should
drive to Lancaster.

19:38.708 --> 19:42.208
Get some practice under your belt.
What do you think?

19:43.708 --> 19:46.125
It hadn't been a great summer so far.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.916
-Okay.
-But things were starting to look up.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.875
See you in the car. Whoo!

20:01.333 --> 20:02.166
Hold on.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.041
Ready.

20:12.250 --> 20:16.083
No rush. Just like to get out
of the driveway by Christmas.

20:20.083 --> 20:25.208
It's about to get Too Fast Too Furious
in this Dodge Caravan.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.625
Okay, cool your jets, Learner's Permit.

20:27.708 --> 20:31.125
Eyes on the road. Keep your hands
at- 00 and- 00. Let's go.

20:31.666 --> 20:34.000
"
playing over stereo]

20:46.916 --> 20:50.500
-Can we change this music?
-Come on. Driver's choice.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.458
-Pete's sake.
-All right, just pull over.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.000
Yep, I know.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.916
-How you doing, officer?
-Good morning.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.125
Shh. Let him handle it.

21:38.958 --> 21:41.916
Uh, why'd you stop me, officer?

21:42.000 --> 21:45.166
-I'll ask the questions. Where you headed?
-Lancaster.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.708
You folks all right?

21:50.541 --> 21:54.500
We're okay. He's new to driving.
He has a permit.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.291
Can I see it?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.958
Whoa! Keep your hands
where I can see them.

22:01.708 --> 22:04.416
Whoa. He's trying to show you his permit.

22:06.708 --> 22:07.625
Nice and easy.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.916
What was the reason for the stop, officer?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.666
-Who are you?
-His father.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.916
He's adopted.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.833
Well, he was going a little fast.

22:38.208 --> 22:39.416
Slow down, kid.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.333
-You dodged a bullet.

22:58.041 --> 22:58.875
Yeah.

23:00.333 --> 23:02.375
You just beat your first ticket.

23:14.541 --> 23:18.750
Rise and shine! It's the big game today.
The biggest!

23:18.833 --> 23:21.833
Come on, Colin! Get up!

23:22.708 --> 23:24.208
Resistance is futile!

23:25.791 --> 23:26.625
Yeah.

23:32.125 --> 23:32.958
You're right.

23:33.833 --> 23:35.416
Resistance is futile.

23:36.125 --> 23:39.208
-What's that? What'd you say?
-What you just said.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.291
Resistance is futile.
I'm agreeing with you.

23:42.375 --> 23:45.250
No. I said, I'm gonna make a strudel.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.166
So weird.

23:55.625 --> 23:56.541
How's your arm?

23:58.416 --> 23:59.541
I'm ready, Dad.

24:00.125 --> 24:02.250
You look ready. You look like a pro.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
See what a clean shave can do? Let's go.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.041
-You doing okay back there?
-Huh?

24:20.125 --> 24:21.666
You doing okay back there?

24:22.458 --> 24:23.708
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

24:32.250 --> 24:35.625
Yo. Why are you dressed
like you fix computers?

24:38.208 --> 24:39.041
Whatever.

24:45.791 --> 24:46.625
What's up, bro?

24:48.166 --> 24:49.875
They play in the tournament?

24:51.583 --> 24:52.541
Watch your gear.

24:55.583 --> 25:00.208
Who steals more than his son? Kid
stole a water bottle with my name on it.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.708
Seriously, don't sweat it, bro.

25:11.708 --> 25:15.250
-You mind having your boys keep it down?
-Yeah, we got you.

25:24.916 --> 25:26.208
I hate this, man.

25:30.833 --> 25:35.875
-Where did you get that shirt from?
-A spot in Vallejo. Where you from?

25:38.208 --> 25:39.250
Turlock.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.291
I think I heard of that,

25:41.791 --> 25:44.375
with all the Confederate flags
and country music and shit.

25:45.458 --> 25:48.250
-That's about right.
-Hey, I'm Dwayne, man.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.000
Didn't know
what he was talking about.

25:50.083 --> 25:51.583
-I'm Colin.
-Stupid.

25:51.666 --> 25:53.708
-Shut up, man.
-Yo, hey, y'all settle down.

25:53.791 --> 25:56.500
-I'm not trying to get kicked out again.
-Again?

25:57.583 --> 25:59.541
They threw us out of here
year before last.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.625
They wouldn't let us stay here last year.

26:02.666 --> 26:03.666
What? Why?

26:05.666 --> 26:11.083
Hey, Keith, Jontavious. Homey wanna know
what we did to get kicked out last time.

26:12.041 --> 26:15.000
-Why you think? For being Black.
-Right?

26:15.083 --> 26:17.625
Yeah. Saying we were loitering
and making guests uncomfortable.

26:17.708 --> 26:21.541
White people were making me
uncomfortable. You know what I mean?

26:22.166 --> 26:24.083
-On my moms, we didn't do nothing.
-No.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.833
I'm sorry. That's messed up.

26:27.416 --> 26:30.208
It is what it is.
Coach says you gotta pick your battles.

26:30.291 --> 26:33.333
So we stay here, get our win and bounce.

26:35.833 --> 26:37.625
Bet they don't bother your team, huh?

26:40.250 --> 26:41.125
Not all of us.

26:42.791 --> 26:43.750
Man.

26:43.833 --> 26:44.708
Come on.

26:49.041 --> 26:52.000
-I should get going.
-All right, player. Peace.

26:52.083 --> 26:52.916
Peace.

26:55.916 --> 27:00.750
Homeboy tuck his shirt in so tight.
Is that how they get down in Turlock?

27:01.833 --> 27:04.666
Man, I ain't mad at him.
He just trying to live.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.500
All right. Let's check in.

27:08.875 --> 27:09.708
Okay.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.125
Thank you.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.041
Sorry.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.208
You two good?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.208
-Okay.
-Fine. Thanks.

27:26.875 --> 27:29.291
Yeah, I'm good too. Thanks.

27:32.666 --> 27:36.625
-Somebody's feisty today.
-Yeah, I don't know what his problem was.

27:37.583 --> 27:38.916
I'm talking about you.

27:42.083 --> 27:45.916
And after all that,
in the last game of the tournament,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.666
I had to face the same dumb umpire

27:48.750 --> 27:52.166
and some dude who was stalling,
trying to psych me out.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.041
Look at this guy.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.083
What an ass.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.125
Time-out.

28:09.375 --> 28:10.958
This guy's a showboat.

28:14.833 --> 28:15.666
Play ball.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.458
Look alive, guys, look alive!

28:24.958 --> 28:25.958
Ball!

28:26.041 --> 28:28.416
-He's crowding the plate.
-You got this, Colin.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.750
-Come on, Kaepernick.
-Let's go, you got it!

28:31.833 --> 28:35.083
What was that? Get some glasses!

28:38.375 --> 28:39.666
Let's go, drive it.

28:44.583 --> 28:47.166
-Ball!
-Hey, he's crowding the plate!

28:50.208 --> 28:51.583
Nice pitch, nice pitch.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.541
Settle down, Colin, you got it.

28:55.958 --> 28:57.750
Who says resistance is futile?

29:05.958 --> 29:07.208
Watch it, Kaepernick!

29:07.291 --> 29:10.375
One more and you'll have the showers
to yourself. Get my meaning?

29:10.458 --> 29:13.208
-Don't test me.
-It's okay, Colin!

29:16.166 --> 29:18.791
I know what you're thinking.
I wasn't really gonna hit him.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.833
Let's go, Kap! Down the barrel!

29:20.916 --> 29:23.166
I needed him to back off the plate,

29:23.250 --> 29:24.791
so I could strike his ass out.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.416
I guess what I learned that summer was

29:28.500 --> 29:31.250
they're not always
gonna give you a fair call.

29:33.041 --> 29:36.208
But you can't let them stop you
from playing the game.

29:36.291 --> 29:38.166
-Strike!
-Attaboy!

29:58.916 --> 30:00.125
Can I talk to you?

30:08.375 --> 30:11.333
Heard you won the championship.
Congratulations.

30:13.208 --> 30:14.041
Thanks.

30:16.666 --> 30:18.375
Well, have fun.

30:18.958 --> 30:21.750
Be careful. Hope to see you
back here next year.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.875
Glad to see you're one of the good ones.

30:28.375 --> 30:29.458
Hey!

30:31.458 --> 30:33.958
-What do you mean by that?
-By what?

30:34.708 --> 30:36.750
One of the good ones. What does that mean?

30:37.833 --> 30:42.500
It means you're nice.
Not like those other boys in the lobby.

30:44.083 --> 30:48.083
You remind me of that one that-- The nerd
with glasses. I meant it as a compliment.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.125
It's not a compliment.

30:51.208 --> 30:53.958
You don't have to get angry.
I was trying to be nice.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.583
Maybe you aren't one of the good ones.

31:04.916 --> 31:07.875
Oh, he must not know
any Black people in real life.

31:08.750 --> 31:09.750
Over the years,

31:10.250 --> 31:13.916
there have been some very popular
TV shows starring Black people.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.208
These shows share archetypal
Black characters,

31:17.291 --> 31:20.458
including social outcasts
who assimilate or conform.

31:21.125 --> 31:24.250
Like Carlton Banks, or Steve Urkel.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.625
Wow. You guys have got
some real A-list people here.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.833
White people love these dudes.

31:30.333 --> 31:33.083
From the way they dress,
the way they talk...

31:33.166 --> 31:34.208
You're our man.

31:34.875 --> 31:38.291
...even the way they dance.
It's all so non-threatening.

31:38.375 --> 31:39.500
James Spurlock.

31:39.583 --> 31:42.833
We call him Toofer, for two-for-one.
He's a Black guy and a Harvard guy.

31:42.916 --> 31:44.666
These characters
have come to be known

31:44.750 --> 31:46.375
by the term "Acceptable Negro."

31:46.458 --> 31:51.250
The Acceptable Negro is a Black character
who inhabits white characteristics...

31:52.833 --> 31:55.333
who makes white people feel comfortable.

31:56.625 --> 32:00.291
The Acceptable Negro
is a white man's creation.

32:01.541 --> 32:06.125
Thing is, white people don't get
to decide who's acceptable to us.

32:06.833 --> 32:12.875
We can rock with Steve Urkel
and Steve Biko and Marcus Garvey.

32:14.416 --> 32:15.333
Huey Newton.

32:16.333 --> 32:17.666
Ida B. Wells.

32:18.791 --> 32:19.833
Toni Morrison.

32:20.666 --> 32:21.750
Fannie Lou Hamer.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.125
Assata Shakur.

32:26.250 --> 32:27.541
Patrice Lumumba.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.000
Kwame Nkrumah.

32:31.916 --> 32:33.041
James Baldwin.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.875
You know, some of the good ones.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.750
As Langston Hughes once said:

32:41.541 --> 32:42.458
"Negroes

32:43.000 --> 32:46.583
Sweet and docile
Meek, humble, and kind

32:47.250 --> 32:50.416
Beware the day
They change their mind"
