WEBVTT

02:23.185 --> 02:24.847
<i>You have the autopsy report.</i>

02:26.063 --> 02:27.599
<i>I don't need to go over that.</i>

02:30.484 --> 02:33.818
<i>Blunt force trauma
and a cervical fracture.</i>

02:36.573 --> 02:39.907
Somebody broke his neck.
Brought him to that cave.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.869
Folded his hands, I guess.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.125
Alan.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.036
Talk to me about Oklahoma.
You have to, man.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.213
- Wayne, this isn't the time...
- How many sets of prints were taken?

02:55.384 --> 02:57.704
Do they know she was
one of the robbers and not a customer?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.120
If they found her, you wouldn't
even be talking to me, right?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.596
Do they have video surveillance?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.424
Mr. Hays,
the purpose of this deposition

03:04.518 --> 03:06.638
is to give your statement,
not to extract one from us.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.520
I'm pretty easygoing,
but go away already.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.806
I don't think I will.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.560
Look, we're not at liberty
to divulge details

03:15.904 --> 03:17.566
of an ongoing police investigation,

03:18.115 --> 03:20.198
nor to share discovery items
with anyone

03:20.283 --> 03:21.774
other than the prosecutor's office.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.846
Now, you can talk to them,
if they'll talk to you...

03:23.870 --> 03:25.862
Hey, hey, hey. All right, stop.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.207
Wayne.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.159
Finish up today, all right?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.123
Then after, we'll speak.

03:34.631 --> 03:38.875
I'm saying, we'll talk. Okay?

03:42.431 --> 03:43.467
Now, you were saying.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.767
You questioned people
during this time. Right?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.136
Do you know another way to do it?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.936
<i>The father worked
at Wilson Body Works,</i>

03:55.026 --> 03:56.866
<i>where they used to make parts
for school buses.</i>

03:57.362 --> 03:58.773
<i>We talked to everybody there.</i>

03:59.364 --> 04:02.072
<i>Employed about 100 people
from West Finger.</i>

04:03.410 --> 04:06.073
<i>The dolls were their own thing.
Wasn't getting us anywhere, either.</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:15.749
Thank you very much.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.666
<i>That guy who collected garbage,
Woodard. We talked to him, too.</i>

04:21.428 --> 04:24.421
I saw the kids.
They were pedaling into the sun.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.555
Headed west?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.260
We went by your place.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.892
You sort of collect things, huh?

04:34.399 --> 04:36.561
I salvage trash that I can sell.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.688
You don't need to make it
sound better than that.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.897
You got any other properties?
Anywhere you keep things?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.611
I don't have anyplace else.

04:45.452 --> 04:49.241
What'd you do before this?
Before you collected scrap.

04:50.749 --> 04:54.618
Uh, came back from overseas. '72.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.786
Did some carpentry.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.539
Construction dropped off.
Things didn't work out.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.712
My marriage. Stuff.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.468
I was gone too long.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.548
About four years ago, she left me.
Took the kids.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.051
I was motor pool.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.726
My man here was a LRRP. Two tours.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.891
Detective Hays.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.477
They called him "Purple Hays"
over there.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.563
You miss your family?

05:24.032 --> 05:25.614
I... Yeah.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.450
I miss being someone that way...

05:29.621 --> 05:30.953
A way I could have a family.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.873
You were recon?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.704
75th Infantry.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.332
Sergeant.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.216
You must be pretty insane,
volunteering for that.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.884
I didn't think about it much,
to tell you the truth.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.849
I ain't one of them burnouts.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.637
You know, comes back busting guys up,
getting high.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.641
And I ain't a bum.
I keep a house. I pay my way.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.351
Hey. I ain't judging, man.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.856
Look, I punch in and out.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.279
I put on a suit in the morning.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.535
And being honest,

06:13.331 --> 06:14.822
I don't have much of a life.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.960
So why? Why punch in?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.796
Why the suit? Why...

06:23.091 --> 06:24.832
I don't ask myself
questions like that.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.595
Could be I'm too chickenshit,
Mr. Woodard.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.891
It ain't my world.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.185
Less than yours, even.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.476
But I did pretty good
at following orders.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.318
Now...

06:43.945 --> 06:45.186
You ever do this?

06:45.780 --> 06:50.070
I miss when "Don't get killed"
was the only thing on my to-do list.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.994
It's hard to unplug from that.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.373
I spent a year coming down.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.132
Just to go back over it,
you sure you didn't see anything?

07:07.761 --> 07:10.629
I told you.
I saw the teenagers out there, too.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.221
I was going in the other direction.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.092
You like kids, generally?

07:17.812 --> 07:18.848
Do...

07:19.814 --> 07:21.476
What the fuck's
the right answer to that?

07:25.278 --> 07:29.238
You think I...
Listen, I got two kids, okay?

07:29.741 --> 07:30.857
Where are they?

07:32.410 --> 07:35.118
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.742
And I haven't gone looking.

07:39.668 --> 07:43.457
If I'd never left,
I think it'd have been fine.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.085
But to go, and come back...

07:48.885 --> 07:51.548
I just couldn't put myself
back in that old story, that's all.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.597
And I couldn't leave it, either.
You know?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.843
You ever been someplace
you couldn't leave,

08:00.647 --> 08:04.391
and you couldn't stay,
both at the same time?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.068
Do you remember the place?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.167
I remember.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.304
I can tell you all
that none of us will rest

08:37.392 --> 08:39.179
until we achieve justice
in the matter.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.726
Our detectives are hard at work,

08:42.355 --> 08:45.314
and this is priority one
for law enforcement

08:45.400 --> 08:48.063
in Washington County
and Northwest Arkansas.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.821
Now, it's temporary,

08:50.905 --> 08:53.145
but we're gonna have to
have a curfew for a little while.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.733
It's important that we keep
an eye on our kids right now,

08:55.827 --> 08:58.267
and we want to make sure
you know where they are at all times,

08:58.496 --> 09:00.283
and that they're indoors by 8:00.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.042
Now, we can't really say
too much about the investigation,

09:05.128 --> 09:06.808
but I'm here to answer
any questions I can.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.415
Well, I don't let mine
go near Devil's Den.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.795
Everybody knows you got
something happening in it.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.845
Bums, junkies.
Queers meet up out there.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.673
You have a question, sir?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.132
I wanna know what y'all are doing
to break up that stuff.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.472
Clean up that park!

09:23.063 --> 09:26.602
What about these junkies?
You got heroin in Arkansas now.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.858
Right now, our focus is trying
to find this little girl

09:30.153 --> 09:31.314
and bring her home.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.595
We're considering every possibility.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.187
And what about that fella

09:35.575 --> 09:37.532
always digging through
everybody's trash?

09:38.078 --> 09:41.492
Mr. Kindt, can you tell us
if they think the girl is still alive?

09:41.831 --> 09:43.663
It's our hope that she's alive, yes.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.495
But again, I really can't discuss

09:45.585 --> 09:47.247
any of the details
of the investigation.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.752
Now, our detectives
have a pair of Xeroxes to pass out.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.800
One is a picture of Julie Purcell.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.508
The other is the kind of backpack
that the boy, Will, had.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.885
It's red and has his name on it.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.351
Now, if anyone has any information
of potential interest,

10:04.437 --> 10:06.850
no matter how far afield,
share it with us.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.367
And trust that we will not
let this terrible,

10:09.651 --> 10:11.483
cowardly act go unpunished.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.945
Your old boss got real vocal
around then.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.861
Gerald Kindt had an election
coming up the next year.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.451
I know.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.781
Guess that works
to some point in your petition.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.489
It's worth noting,
I think, his motivations.

10:26.209 --> 10:29.418
Well, now he's fucking
State Attorney General.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.131
But we didn't work for him.
He was your boss.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.876
Oh, not for a good while now.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.589
The broken neck is clear.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.974
But the way the arms were folded...

10:44.727 --> 10:46.138
- I know.
- And the other thing.

10:46.646 --> 10:51.107
- The hell are those dolls for?
- Correct. Look familiar, some way.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.314
Like the kind of thing
at country fairs.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.444
What do you get
from that crowd in there?

10:57.824 --> 10:58.905
They're worried.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.210
Could be thinking
it could have been a neighbor.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.743
Had them sign in.
Saw some shifty eyes in there,

11:11.754 --> 11:13.461
but may be my redneck radar.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.008
I don't know.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.841
Excuse me.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.143
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.239
You found him, didn't you?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.124
You look like you haven't
slept in a couple days.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.999
Work to do. How's it at school?

11:51.336 --> 11:52.336
Sad.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.295
People are scared.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.638
Uh...

12:03.348 --> 12:04.884
Been asking about this.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.808
We haven't gotten anything.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.975
I don't know,
you knowing the kids and such.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.933
You ever seen anything like this?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.526
Seen a kid with a doll like this?

12:19.239 --> 12:22.198
Uh, maybe. I don't know.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.946
But looks like something you'd find
in a craft store or something.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.163
I haven't seen
any of the kids with them.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.750
Can I keep this?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.702
Uh, sure.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.965
I'll ask around with the kids,
maybe check with the other teachers.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.508
All right. Thanks.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.722
Uh...

12:46.683 --> 12:47.683
Amelia.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.308
- Okay, I gotta go.
- All right.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.525
Be safe.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.280
Now, this family,

13:04.367 --> 13:05.983
haven't we spent enough time
with this?

13:17.005 --> 13:18.086
It's helping me.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.548
Bringing things back.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.385
How's that?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.098
Your mother.

13:30.518 --> 13:31.518
I, um...

13:34.897 --> 13:36.729
I have trouble seeing her sometimes.

13:37.775 --> 13:44.022
Or I know who she is,
but the parts of our lives, pieces,

13:45.867 --> 13:47.108
I can't picture them.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.950
You think Mom wants you
to keep doing this?

13:52.915 --> 13:56.079
It's bringing things back,
going over the case.

13:57.128 --> 14:01.418
I'm remembering things.
My life. Your sister.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.589
You know when the last time
I saw Rebecca?

14:15.063 --> 14:16.224
Mom's funeral?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.559
I think you talked
on the phone a few months back.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.205
You sure you wanna
keep talking to the TV people?

14:42.507 --> 14:46.547
That woman, the director,
I wanna know what she's after.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.844
What they might know now.

14:50.181 --> 14:53.800
She said she'd, uh, show me something
next time.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.559
She's baiting you, Dad.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.850
Do you think she cares at all
about you or who did it?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.934
She just wants people
to watch her shitty show.

15:05.446 --> 15:09.065
And I think
Mom would want you to move on.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.265
Enjoy the family you have around you.

15:15.081 --> 15:19.997
Well,
she and I always had different ideas.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.577
I remember that.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.044
Wayne. Roland.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.468
Special Agents Burt Diller
and John Bowen.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.467
Thanks, Detective.
We'll get these back ASAP.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.344
Want you to know we have no intention

15:38.563 --> 15:41.146
of impeding or usurping
your investigation.

15:41.482 --> 15:45.192
This is a Task Force.
One unit with a common goal.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.756
Feds are gonna take the lead
with the kidnapping.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.318
You two are still point
on the death investigation.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.116
Both of which will hopefully
lead to the same solution.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.322
Everybody shares everything.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.196
We'll be doing debriefs
first thing every morning.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.406
Everybody turns in dailies.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.202
How you guys wanna go forward?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.501
We got a multi-state APB
out on the girl.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.955
Checkpoints along state lines.
Agents advised.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.044
Let's get caught up.
We'll figure our next move.

16:12.889 --> 16:13.889
Time?

16:14.765 --> 16:16.051
You two have somewhere to be?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.766
We got a funeral to get to.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.204
I know we spoke on the phone,

16:46.130 --> 16:48.010
but we want to touch base
on a couple of things.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.383
What's that?

16:50.927 --> 16:52.634
I haven't been out here
since last May.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.213
You stayed
in the boy Will's room, right?

16:55.306 --> 16:56.717
Yeah. Told you I did.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.973
Leave a couple magazines behind?

16:59.977 --> 17:01.263
Under the mattress?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.971
Damn. Yeah, maybe I did.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.147
Uh, should I...

17:07.527 --> 17:08.643
Never mind.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.194
You recall anything from the time
you spent in the house

17:11.280 --> 17:12.646
might be worth mentioning?

17:13.156 --> 17:15.365
Like, you ever see anybody
talking to the kids?

17:15.952 --> 17:17.659
Any adults you didn't recognize?

17:18.162 --> 17:21.530
Nah. Nah.
Can't say I recall anything like that.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.915
Them kids, they kept
to themselves a lot, you know.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.402
The house was a pretty tense place.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.936
I mean, you can probably tell,
Lucy and Tom, they aren't real happy.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.416
Before any of this.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.678
Will and Julie,
they play outside the house a lot?

17:37.431 --> 17:38.638
Yeah. I think so.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.465
I don't think they liked
being around there.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.392
You know, Mom and Dad
angry all the time.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.061
Were you pretty close
to Will and Julie?

17:53.864 --> 17:58.825
I don't know. We got along.
I played with them a couple times.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.120
They didn't see me much
before I stayed here.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.739
But they were good kids.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.539
What do you think of Tom?

18:09.130 --> 18:10.462
He's an all right guy.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.634
I feel sorry for him.
I felt for him even before all this.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.630
I mean, in my opinion,

18:20.224 --> 18:22.557
Lucy always needed,
like, a strong male.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.307
Staying in town long?

18:27.982 --> 18:29.848
Nah, I gotta get back to work.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.064
Family could probably use you around.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.690
I can't get the time off.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.105
It's not like there's a lot
I can do for them.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.990
And the night of?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.618
Your neighbor can confirm
you were at home?

18:45.833 --> 18:47.199
I don't know if they can or not.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.285
But you could check
with the Starlight Bar in Springfield.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.037
I had a couple there after work,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.248
and then I went home
and watched <i>CHiPs.</i>

18:55.217 --> 18:58.585
- You wanna search my place?
- Would that be okay?

19:01.098 --> 19:02.098
Sure.

19:03.601 --> 19:07.390
But maybe you should be out there
trying to find my niece.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.728
I'm gonna get back to Lucy.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.487
Like we said over the phone,

19:22.411 --> 19:25.995
we hadn't seen or talked
with the kids since last Christmas.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.703
Nearly a year ago.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.541
- She doesn't like us.
- That's Lucy, you mean?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.710
Eloise, let's don't, now.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.416
Why not now?

19:37.843 --> 19:40.426
Why not just say it?
The children are lost.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.299
Yes, I mean Lucy.
She runs around on Tom, you know.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.722
Every marriage has its own story.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.220
Nobody knows except the two involved.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.896
Bull. She was a terrible...

19:54.568 --> 19:58.232
You know, there's been
some wondering about Julie.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.234
Don't. Not today.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.656
Tom was working offshore.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.693
Could have been welding in Texas
when Julie was conceived.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.870
- Now, I've wondered...
- God damn it!

20:08.791 --> 20:11.750
Not today, Eloise. Not today.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.881
Hey.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.884
Why don't the two of y'all
get out of my house for today?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.672
Mom, Dad.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.603
Yeah, I got it now.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.742
There's a web forum

20:45.786 --> 20:47.778
that posts
about real-life criminal cases,

20:47.872 --> 20:50.239
things that are unsolved
or unresolved.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.383
They have a whole section
on the Purcell case.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.047
This is what people do now?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.241
They go in lots of directions.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.425
Did you know at various times since,

21:06.515 --> 21:08.928
large-scale pedophile rings
connected to people of influence

21:09.018 --> 21:10.930
were uncovered in
the surrounding areas?

21:11.020 --> 21:13.012
Do you know about
the Franklin scandal?

21:15.316 --> 21:16.727
No.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.544
It's been theorized
that the straw dolls

21:18.652 --> 21:21.486
are a sign of pedophile groups,
like the crooked spiral.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.113
I don't think that's right.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.451
Can I ask, with what happened in 1990
and you leaving the force,

21:33.042 --> 21:34.999
did you ever feel
your leads and theories

21:35.085 --> 21:36.701
were discounted because of your race?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.415
Not particularly. No, why?

21:42.051 --> 21:43.792
I'm interested
in the intersectionality

21:43.886 --> 21:44.967
of marginalized groups

21:45.054 --> 21:47.512
within authoritarian
and systemic racist structures.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.101
Anyways, those dolls from the scene,

21:57.191 --> 21:58.351
they were a significant lead.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.861
Amelia. She's the one
helped us out with that.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.646
Got us that lead.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.166
Have you seen a doll
that looks like this?

22:17.378 --> 22:18.378
No.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.835
Not you?

22:20.130 --> 22:22.167
Okay, well, you let me know
if you do, okay?

22:36.397 --> 22:39.936
Mike, have you seen this doll before?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.194
Halloween.

22:44.780 --> 22:48.899
Somebody was passing them out
at trick-or-treat, I think.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.411
Julie, she got one.

22:54.665 --> 22:57.624
This Halloween you went
trick-or-treating with her?

22:58.961 --> 23:02.375
We met her and her brother
and... And some other kids.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.499
We live on the next street over.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.257
It's okay.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.910
Tom?

23:33.287 --> 23:35.244
Tom! Tom!

23:37.041 --> 23:40.000
Hey, what you doing
back up here, brother?

23:40.336 --> 23:43.704
Talking about?
This is my usual shift. Four years.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.763
What's your fucking problem?
My dick showing?

24:03.233 --> 24:04.233
Hey, Tom.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.151
You sure you wanna be back
at work today?

24:08.280 --> 24:11.899
I've been working full-time
since I was 14 years old.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.577
You want me to sit at home
with this shit in my head now?

24:22.002 --> 24:23.355
How long
are you motherfuckers

24:23.379 --> 24:24.379
gonna stare at me?

24:25.923 --> 24:29.542
Somebody got something
to say about me? My family?

24:30.427 --> 24:32.134
Huh? Somebody know
something I don't...

24:32.221 --> 24:34.588
Tom? Hi.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.553
We didn't plan on
having you back this soon.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.135
Well, I gotta earn a living.

24:40.938 --> 24:45.649
Well, the thing is,
we, uh... We put you on leave.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.143
Well, I didn't ask for that, okay?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.274
Now, I gotta work.
You telling me I can't work?

24:51.865 --> 24:54.608
Look, with everything
that's happening,

24:54.702 --> 24:55.738
it's a little disruptive.

24:57.371 --> 24:58.891
People have other things
on their mind.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.039
These machines.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.122
That's how accidents happen.
You know that, Tom.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.622
I'm the guy
nobody wants to be, huh?

25:12.636 --> 25:14.218
I'm a fucking joke, right?

25:16.140 --> 25:17.802
You shouldn't look at it like that.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.138
But you ain't coming back
to work right now, Tom.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.183
Well, fuck everything, anyway!

25:29.236 --> 25:32.820
Yeah, fuck each of you! I quit!

25:39.288 --> 25:41.450
You remember which house
was giving these out?

25:44.460 --> 25:45.667
Who else got one?

25:50.424 --> 25:54.134
Mike, did you see her get the doll?

25:56.513 --> 25:57.513
No, ma'am.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.847
When did you see she had it?

26:00.768 --> 26:02.009
It was like at the end.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.344
We were all showing what we got,

26:05.022 --> 26:07.355
and she had the doll
in her trick-or-treat bag.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.688
Did you stay in the neighborhood,
or did you drive somewhere?

26:11.487 --> 26:12.694
We just walked.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.446
Thanks, Mike. You're really helping.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.245
Hey. What'd you go as for Halloween?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.032
Luke Skywalker.

26:25.459 --> 26:29.669
Cool, man.
My partner, he loved that movie.

26:47.564 --> 26:48.564
Say, uh,

26:50.776 --> 26:52.816
were you with Julie and her brother
the whole night?

26:53.612 --> 26:56.650
Or was there ever a time
y'all went different ways?

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
Yeah.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.034
They'd been to a couple houses
before we met up.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.162
But I don't think
she had the doll then.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.536
How about the rest of the night?

27:08.919 --> 27:10.660
We might have split up once or twice.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.373
But not for long.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.589
I saw her talking to people.
Adults, maybe.

27:20.681 --> 27:23.594
They were two ghosts.
Just in big sheets.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.677
You don't know who the ghosts were?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.190
Can you show us
where it was y'all went?

27:36.363 --> 27:37.363
Here.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.151
You must have had some good times.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.817
When y'all meet?

28:26.246 --> 28:27.737
Thirteen years back.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.165
We got married
'cause she was pregnant.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.745
How long you knew her before?

28:37.007 --> 28:38.123
Not long.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.339
Got married three months after we met.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.338
The Fort Smith courthouse.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.474
Me and Lucy,

28:48.727 --> 28:51.014
we never really knew each other,
we just...

28:52.314 --> 28:53.680
Well, had the kids.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.445
My kids. Will and...

29:15.921 --> 29:17.958
Are we gonna find Julie, or what?

29:20.634 --> 29:22.466
'Cause I can't live through this, man.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.216
Neither of us can.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.144
If we're not gonna find her,
I just need to know now.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.563
I can't go to sleep,

29:43.448 --> 29:44.734
and I can't wake up.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.363
Now, you're saying
last week, Halloween,

29:51.665 --> 29:53.031
girl got one of these dolls,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.085
and then you found two of them
at the crime scene?

29:55.335 --> 29:56.792
It's an identifier, boss.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.707
So what do you want to do?

29:59.172 --> 30:02.586
We wondered, maybe
let's put it out on the TV or paper.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.710
Ask everybody
if they seen one of those,

30:05.804 --> 30:07.261
or know who makes them around here.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.465
But that'd tip our hand.
We're not ready for that.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.304
What's better...

30:12.394 --> 30:15.057
There's 114 households
in the marked area

30:15.147 --> 30:16.683
and the subdivision near it.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.139
We do total surveillance.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.733
We have people searching
every single house.

30:21.403 --> 30:24.111
Oh, come on. You don't have enough
for one warrant, much less 100.

30:24.448 --> 30:28.032
No warrants.
Say, two days, maybe three.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.821
Every detective we have.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.827
Pull in more Feds, you want.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.781
Everybody just knocks
and asks if they can search.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.957
Say it'll help with the Purcell case.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.204
People won't like it,
but a lot, I bet...

30:42.382 --> 30:43.782
A lot of people let us look around.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.584
We keep surveillance.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.885
See if somebody starts acting hinky.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.714
Nobody escapes the net.
Our guy panics or something,

30:51.183 --> 30:53.391
we do it fast, without announcement.

30:53.477 --> 30:56.515
Even if you find anything,
it could be problematic at trial.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.098
This is about the girl, not a trial.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.941
Something happened
on Halloween, that night.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.601
She gets that doll.

31:04.071 --> 31:05.858
A week later,
she and her brother are gone,

31:05.947 --> 31:07.859
and you got two of those things
on the scene.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.949
Maybe the perp's
just brought them somewhere.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.444
You know?
Maybe the dolls belonged to the girl.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.697
It's all maybes, man.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.893
You do the maybe
that gives you a shot.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.208
No, it's thin.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.584
I mean, our constituents here,

31:19.669 --> 31:22.082
they value privacy
and property rights.

31:22.672 --> 31:26.131
They aren't just gonna acquiesce
to random searches of their homes.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.756
There's other ways to approach it.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.159
If we bring in the public,
it stirs up the town

31:33.183 --> 31:34.924
and lets our guy know
what we're thinking.

31:35.352 --> 31:36.352
Maybe he takes off.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.473
Maybe he just kills her,
if he hasn't already.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.223
We can just do it fast.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.854
People will get over it.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.615
Warren.

31:50.283 --> 31:51.990
Just give us some time, Roland.

32:18.145 --> 32:19.852
Been running this sting.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.225
Truck stop next door.
Prosts and drugs.

32:22.983 --> 32:25.316
I was gonna check this guy out
at some point.

32:25.819 --> 32:29.813
He asked one of the working girls
if they had any younger friends.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.023
And another said he asked her, too.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.489
Came in here looking
for special magazines.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.328
Ted LaGrange. Pulled his file.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.073
He got outta Wrightsville
a while back.

32:41.168 --> 32:45.708
Carnal knowledge of a minor.
Enticing a minor. Bunch of shit.

32:48.425 --> 32:51.543
Calling himself
"Robert" something now.

32:52.637 --> 32:53.718
Thanks, Rich.

32:56.892 --> 33:00.852
Man, you gotta come in here every day?

33:03.523 --> 33:04.764
Welcome to Vice.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.834
I haven't seen you here before,
have I?

33:34.971 --> 33:36.803
I'm usually at the VFW.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.129
Want to thank you for everything
you did today with the kid.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.980
He wasn't talking to us
till you opened him up.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.018
Real grateful for that.

33:51.738 --> 33:52.979
He was broken up about it.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.399
I think he had a crush on Julie.

33:59.496 --> 34:01.112
Why'd you give me that picture?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.290
The doll.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.203
Instinct, I guess.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.623
I knew the kids weren't talking to us.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.373
You were in the war?

34:15.594 --> 34:16.880
You're a cop,

34:16.972 --> 34:18.884
so you want to know
more about a person,

34:18.974 --> 34:20.054
you just look them up, huh?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.056
Pretty much.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.601
Did you look me up?

34:29.900 --> 34:30.982
Thought about it, though.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.317
I was born here.

34:40.620 --> 34:41.827
I went to U of A.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.202
Dropped out my junior year.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.833
Went west with a friend.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.460
We got in with some people.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.792
I was in this scene, San Francisco.

34:55.217 --> 34:59.303
Anti-war,
kind of fringe Panther stuff.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.675
Some things happened, not good.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.435
And then I was alone.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.807
'74, I came back home, got my degree.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.568
I grew up in Conway.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.742
My mom worked on a farm.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.032
I spent two years in the jungle.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.824
A lot of it I was alone.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.371
I hunt a lot now. Alone.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.124
I'm a vegetarian.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.842
That's a real shame.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.213
If you're a Democrat, don't tell me.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.726
You like teaching?

35:49.898 --> 35:50.934
Sometimes.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.358
I want to be a writer.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.360
Write books.

35:59.366 --> 36:00.732
I don't read enough.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.076
I like Batman and Silver Surfer.

36:06.122 --> 36:09.115
I had this sort of
dyslexic thing growing up.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.659
Was that hard?

36:12.629 --> 36:13.870
They said I was dumb.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.043
My mom wasn't having any of that.

36:20.887 --> 36:24.051
That poem you were teaching,
I looked it up.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.298
- Oh, yeah?
- I read it.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.102
I'm not ready to talk about it yet,
but I have thoughts.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.098
- Share when you want.
- All right.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.561
You ever been married?

36:39.572 --> 36:40.572
No.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.316
You?

36:44.119 --> 36:45.951
I was engaged. Seven months.

36:47.664 --> 36:48.871
I broke it off.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.282
I didn't want to be married,
I realized.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.328
- I don't wanna get married.
- No?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.299
Guy the other day
said I must be crazy.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.671
Thing is, and I've thought
of this for a while,

37:07.684 --> 37:08.970
I think I might be.

37:10.603 --> 37:11.639
Like how?

37:17.610 --> 37:19.943
I wear clip-on ties
'cause I'm preoccupied

37:20.029 --> 37:22.316
with this idea
of getting strangled with one.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.696
Is that too much?

37:30.623 --> 37:32.785
This year, twice,

37:33.501 --> 37:36.994
I've been to St. Louis,
and I've stayed at this hotel,

37:37.630 --> 37:39.337
and I've pretended I'm someone else.

37:40.842 --> 37:44.586
I go out, meet new people,
and I am someone else.

37:45.054 --> 37:48.638
Different name,
different background, different job.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.392
Twice.

37:59.569 --> 38:00.685
You drink too much?

38:02.447 --> 38:03.528
I don't know.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.820
I might get drunk twice a month.

38:08.953 --> 38:09.989
Three times.

38:11.748 --> 38:13.330
I like to laugh, is the thing.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.211
Hey. Raise it up.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.040
Hurry. Quick.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.840
<i>...information
in the Purcell murder-kidnapping,</i>

38:27.180 --> 38:29.923
<i>we go to the Washington County
courthouse earlier this afternoon.</i>

38:30.016 --> 38:31.132
Don't do it.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.120
<i>We believe the missing girl,</i>

38:33.144 --> 38:36.228
<i>Julie Purcell,
was contacted by her abductor</i>

38:36.314 --> 38:38.601
<i>while she participated
in Halloween last week.</i>

38:39.818 --> 38:41.980
<i>We're sharing a graphic of the area</i>

38:42.070 --> 38:43.990
<i>where she and her brother
went trick-or-treating.</i>

38:44.864 --> 38:46.571
<i>Now, our investigation suggests</i>

38:46.658 --> 38:49.742
<i>that someone who saw her on Halloween
has special knowledge of this case.</i>

38:50.620 --> 38:51.827
Giving it away.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.779
<i>Anyone who saw
anything suspicious...</i>

38:53.873 --> 38:56.115
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry. I...

38:56.793 --> 38:59.331
I gotta go. God damn it.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.283
<i>Are you saying the children
knew their kidnapper?</i>

39:02.465 --> 39:05.879
<i>I'm not at liberty to, uh,
reveal that at this time. Thank you.</i>

39:09.681 --> 39:11.281
I knew
they wouldn't listen to me.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.932
But you should have stopped that.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.437
Me? What am I supposed to do?

39:19.065 --> 39:20.146
You were there.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.313
I'm saying, I talk,
it don't mean anything.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.228
Don't matter if I'm right.

39:26.155 --> 39:29.148
You, at least, you talk,
it means something to them.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.699
Might consider what you're saying.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.221
You might have stopped them
from doing that.

39:32.245 --> 39:35.204
Bullshit.
Who knew until it was on the TV?

39:35.540 --> 39:36.656
Why didn't you stop them?

39:37.000 --> 39:40.368
They ain't my tribe, man.
Take care of your shit.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.828
Tribe?
Where you think you are, asshole?

39:43.172 --> 39:45.960
- I know where I am.
- Do you? It don't sound like it.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.915
Son, I know where I am in a way
you will never understand.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.136
Are you high, "Purple" Hays?

39:51.681 --> 39:53.764
'Cause you're making
about as much goddamn sense

39:53.850 --> 39:55.307
as my grandmother's dementia.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.759
No, I'm saying I know where I am.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.185
Hey, good for you.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.165
Was all I could think of.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.587
You got something else?

40:35.308 --> 40:38.051
Vice gave me a dude
near Fort Smith to look at.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.344
I pulled his file.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.607
What is it?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.612
You can read for yourself.

41:03.670 --> 41:04.831
You wanna go get him?

41:08.383 --> 41:09.624
I wanna go get him.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.927
We might as well keep watch out here.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.343
Check the guy out in the morning.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.428
Toss his place first.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.688
We should get bennies.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.606
Staying up all night.

41:36.285 --> 41:38.948
Glove box. Red and blue ones.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.907
Prosecuting attorney decided

41:45.044 --> 41:50.039
best thing was to take our single clue
and spread it all over the town.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.256
And that got us a few hundred
false tips the first couple of days.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.887
That's when it all started
with the town.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.100
Just panic.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.815
<i>Lived in their
imaginations now, you see?</i>

42:28.713 --> 42:30.045
<i>Everybody was scared.</i>

42:32.050 --> 42:33.166
<i>That included us.</i>

42:51.235 --> 42:52.235
Hi.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.030
Morning.

43:02.497 --> 43:03.533
You gonna eat?

43:08.086 --> 43:09.202
Me neither.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.498
We need you to come with us, sir.

43:17.929 --> 43:20.421
- What's the...
- We'll tell you on the way.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.057
No! Please!

43:25.895 --> 43:27.557
No, it's not me, I swear to God!

43:29.023 --> 43:31.766
You're wrong about this.
You shouldn't have brought me here.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.067
This get you off, mister, huh?

43:34.946 --> 43:37.279
You entertain fantasies
of strapping white men to posts?

43:39.283 --> 43:41.366
- Now and then, yeah.
- Really?

43:44.914 --> 43:46.246
Talk about your fantasies.

43:46.916 --> 43:48.202
Then he'll tell you his.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.037
Theodore LaGrange.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.456
It's Ted, yeah?

43:54.090 --> 43:55.672
Ted, you been out
a bit over two years.

43:56.384 --> 43:57.384
I haven't done anything.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.196
I know what you're doing,
and I haven't done anything.

43:59.220 --> 44:00.300
Released from Wrightsville.

44:01.514 --> 44:05.224
You got Little Rock up the road.
Why'd you come way out here, Ted?

44:07.854 --> 44:09.720
And why are you calling yourself
Robert Hebert?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.810
I...
I wanted a new start.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.441
They keep you in protective custody
in Wrightsville?

44:18.364 --> 44:19.364
Figured.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.191
Guys who mess with kids,

44:23.077 --> 44:25.285
they don't usually make it out
with all their parts.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.404
Tell me how you mess with kids.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.577
The boy and the girl.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.330
Your landlady said you
didn't come home last Friday night.

44:32.420 --> 44:33.501
- What?
- The 7th.

44:34.255 --> 44:37.214
That's not... I was out.
I was just out.

44:37.550 --> 44:39.831
Help me understand what it was like
for you in the moment.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.635
Let me feel your side of it. Okay?

44:43.764 --> 44:45.926
- Tell me why you killed the boy.
- I didn't!

44:46.434 --> 44:48.266
I never seen him
before he was on the news.

44:53.149 --> 44:55.687
You'll wanna explain to me
where you were that night.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.728
Help me see your side of things.

45:01.991 --> 45:03.911
What'd you do on Halloween night?
Where were you?

45:07.872 --> 45:08.872
Well,

45:10.625 --> 45:12.912
we're here to listen
when you want to share.

45:39.904 --> 45:42.362
Yes. He's here Mondays and Fridays.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.107
We do story time twice a week
in the evenings,

45:45.201 --> 45:46.567
and he plays guitar for it.

45:46.953 --> 45:50.162
But his name's Robert Hebert,
not what you said.

45:50.498 --> 45:52.285
And he worked on the 7th? Last Friday?

45:52.625 --> 45:53.625
Yes, mmm-hmm.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.813
You know what time he left that night?

45:56.128 --> 45:57.494
Probably about 8:00 or after.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.213
He helped us put up
the tables and chairs.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.586
Did he do something?

46:03.719 --> 46:05.631
You're not gonna see this guy anymore.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.089
If you do, give us a call, okay?

46:15.940 --> 46:17.602
Robbery
was a couple of months ago.

46:17.692 --> 46:19.729
All I know for sure
is that her prints showed up.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.652
It's like you said...

46:23.197 --> 46:26.281
They don't know if she was a customer
or part of the break-in.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.278
Was it a partial or a full?

46:29.161 --> 46:30.161
Full.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.496
It was her.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.457
They had video surveillance?

46:36.752 --> 46:38.493
Oh, they smashed the camera
in the pharmacy.

46:38.921 --> 46:41.129
Store's got footage
going back three days prior.

46:41.215 --> 46:43.628
We subpoenaed it, but we have to wait.

46:44.176 --> 46:46.338
Somebody watching the store
in case she comes back?

46:47.221 --> 46:50.134
My understanding,
Sallisaw PD's focused on the robbery.

46:50.641 --> 46:51.882
And I wouldn't say the locals

46:52.018 --> 46:55.307
are a crackerjack investigative team
or anything...

46:55.563 --> 46:56.804
So nothing.

46:57.189 --> 47:00.478
Man's family didn't have
the resources for an investigator.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.651
But obviously, we'd like to find her.

47:10.703 --> 47:13.286
What about Arkansas PD?
They looking for her?

47:13.873 --> 47:15.705
There's nobody on the case yet.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.790
Kindt's office will have to look at it

47:17.877 --> 47:19.837
since they'll be defending
our motion to overturn,

47:19.962 --> 47:21.999
but right now, no.

47:22.673 --> 47:23.789
I don't think so.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.754
You all right going up
against your old boss?

47:29.221 --> 47:30.462
It's overdue.

47:43.778 --> 47:44.894
Talk to Roland?

47:45.654 --> 47:47.065
We have an appointment.

47:48.824 --> 47:50.156
He's done well.

47:52.161 --> 47:53.161
He has.

48:14.558 --> 48:15.765
You wanna execute him?

48:16.060 --> 48:18.643
We can bury him right out here.
I don't give a shit.

48:19.772 --> 48:22.310
Throw him off a bridge...
Nobody'll care.

48:22.691 --> 48:24.808
Put him in holding,

48:24.902 --> 48:26.063
get his parole violated.

48:26.153 --> 48:27.689
He'll be back
in Wrightsville tomorrow.

48:28.030 --> 48:31.068
- Full sentence.
- If you say so.

48:31.826 --> 48:33.112
Talk shit about us...

48:33.869 --> 48:36.236
I'll have monstrous niggers
fuck him to death in his cell.

48:37.832 --> 48:41.325
Do you hear me, boy?
You will bleed black cock.

48:46.340 --> 48:49.174
Gotta catch up, man.
Just spent the day on this bullshit.

48:55.307 --> 48:59.017
That was a vivid description
of prison rape. Jesus.

48:59.478 --> 49:01.014
Could tell he had the racial thing.

49:01.522 --> 49:02.882
Remember what he said in the barn?

49:03.566 --> 49:05.979
Still, it's gonna haunt me.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.090
<i>D-12, do you copy?</i>

49:17.037 --> 49:18.037
Copy, dispatch.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.706
<i>Lieutenant Twiggs wants y'all
at the Purcell place.</i>

49:24.086 --> 49:25.086
What's up?

49:25.588 --> 49:27.329
<i>Said the family got a note.</i>

49:31.969 --> 49:34.006
Copy. On the way.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.854
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

50:16.347 --> 50:20.557
Hey. Hey.
Did you see? They sent me the galleys.

50:20.643 --> 50:21.724
That's great.

50:23.646 --> 50:25.308
You got a little loose after work?

50:27.191 --> 50:28.523
How was the deposition?

50:29.276 --> 50:30.312
It was fine.

50:39.954 --> 50:41.786
It's as much about us
as anything.

50:43.916 --> 50:45.623
And I think her and me,

50:47.086 --> 50:49.406
it was as close as she could give
the thing a happy ending.

50:52.466 --> 50:54.128
After the events of 1990,

50:54.510 --> 50:57.002
and what happened
with Julie and her father,

50:57.763 --> 50:59.129
you left the PD.

51:00.266 --> 51:02.303
Did you believe
that concluded the case?

51:03.269 --> 51:05.807
Did you feel the investigation
ended too abruptly?

51:07.106 --> 51:09.849
She wrote six novels after.
This was her first.

51:11.235 --> 51:12.851
Uh, very...

51:13.988 --> 51:17.197
To a cop,
very impressive eye for detail.

51:17.992 --> 51:18.992
Have you read it?

51:20.536 --> 51:22.903
Mr. Hays, did you have theories
after what happened

51:23.080 --> 51:25.037
with Julie Purcell
and her father in '90?

51:25.583 --> 51:28.371
Theories that weren't in line
with your superior's directives?

51:28.460 --> 51:29.792
I heard what you asked.

51:31.005 --> 51:32.246
The answer is...

51:33.966 --> 51:36.674
I never stopped coming up
with theories about that case.

51:38.470 --> 51:42.589
And I hit Todd and Dave into a home,
and when I went over, we won.

51:42.683 --> 51:45.096
Coach saw, and came and talked
to me about baseball

51:45.185 --> 51:46.221
when I get older.

51:51.150 --> 51:53.267
- That's fantastic, Henry.
- Mmm-hmm.

51:53.611 --> 51:56.319
You're gonna be very athletic.
You already are.

52:10.294 --> 52:12.911
The publisher said we can
issue an update for the paperback

52:13.005 --> 52:14.667
once this appeal goes to trial.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.549
Yeah?

52:21.388 --> 52:23.220
You're a bit out of it tonight.

52:24.266 --> 52:25.473
The kids noticed.

52:25.893 --> 52:27.600
You can't be that way
in front of them.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.638
- I'm not drunk.
- What's going on?

52:33.817 --> 52:35.353
What happened with the deposition?

52:37.655 --> 52:39.112
Are they overturning the conviction?

52:43.202 --> 52:44.738
Julie Purcell is alive.

52:58.384 --> 53:00.125
Thought for sure
you'd all beat us here.

53:01.387 --> 53:03.067
What is that, huh?

53:03.514 --> 53:04.630
What's that mean?

53:20.614 --> 53:21.900
Well, what's it mean?

53:22.491 --> 53:23.491
Hmm?

53:36.213 --> 53:37.733
You want more chicken, Wayne?

53:41.635 --> 53:42.635
Uh...

53:44.763 --> 53:46.095
Thanks for the spread, Heather.

53:46.890 --> 53:47.971
This is wonderful.

53:48.851 --> 53:50.058
Are you feeling all right?

53:52.438 --> 53:55.351
He's been going back
through that case. Mom's book.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.562
I never read the whole thing.

54:00.404 --> 54:02.270
Couldn't stand I was in it so much.

54:04.825 --> 54:06.657
Going back over the story,
it's good...

54:07.619 --> 54:10.953
Making me work my brain, I mean.
Leading me to other stuff.

54:15.753 --> 54:18.416
Maybe you guys could see
about getting Rebecca out here.

54:19.506 --> 54:20.622
I'd like to see her.

54:23.635 --> 54:24.921
She's in L.A., Dad.

54:26.388 --> 54:27.469
When did that happen?

54:28.724 --> 54:29.840
What's she doing out there?

54:31.185 --> 54:32.676
She's playing music, Wayne.

54:37.024 --> 54:38.265
She okay? You talk to her?

54:38.692 --> 54:40.354
I talked to her
a few weeks ago.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.237
Think she'd come back home
for a visit?

54:45.824 --> 54:47.315
She don't like it here, Dad.

54:48.452 --> 54:49.452
Why not?

54:51.997 --> 54:53.613
I just don't think it suits her.

54:53.999 --> 54:56.286
- She never liked it.
- She didn't?

54:56.794 --> 54:58.035
Hey!

54:59.838 --> 55:01.170
One more time, okay?

55:04.343 --> 55:05.754
Shh, eat.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.802
It's going by pretty quick.

55:11.642 --> 55:12.849
Don't I know it.

55:17.189 --> 55:19.727
Maybe you guys could see
about getting Rebecca out here.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.107
I'd like to see her.
