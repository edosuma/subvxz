Ah!

00:21.280 --> 00:23.720
-Said it could never be found. -Ha-ha!

00:23.840 --> 00:25.480
NAOMI: Well done, darling.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.240
Guess they didn't reckon on you coming along,

00:25.520 --> 00:28.240
eh, Mr Walker?

00:28.280 --> 00:29.320
We did it, Dad.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.440
We did, Sam.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.600
To us.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.840
-To us. -And the Santa Ana silver.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.400
For 400 years,

00:39.920 --> 00:43.400
this little lot has sat on the seabed

00:39.920 --> 00:43.400
just waiting to be discovered.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.640
We did it.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.800
We did. Cheers!

00:47.840 --> 00:50.000
ALL: Cheers! Whoo!

00:51.080 --> 00:53.880
You know, the last few weeks have been amazing.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.960
I'm glad you think so, Addison.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.160
So I was wondering,

00:59.200 --> 01:02.000
how you feel about me maybe joining

00:59.200 --> 01:02.000
the team full

01:03.320 --> 01:05.400
Got a thirst for more riches, eh?

01:09.440 --> 01:10.640
Walker!

01:11.400 --> 01:13.080
I know you're there.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.840
Tosh Walker! Show yourself!

01:15.000 --> 01:19.200
-Newton Farrell, there's a surprise.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.240
I heard about your little find.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.240
You must feel real proud of yourself.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.040
You know I found that silver fair and square.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.280
There was nothing fair about what you did!

01:28.880 --> 01:30.400
You took advantage of me!

01:31.680 --> 01:34.440
Yeah, well, that's how it goes sometimes.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.080
Deal with it.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.280
Ah!

01:38.360 --> 01:40.480
Dad! Dad! Dad! Leave it, leave it.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.560
Leave him, leave him.

01:42.880 --> 01:43.960
Leave it, Dad!

01:44.440 --> 01:45.600
Get away from my boat.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.920
-Get away from my boat! -NAOMI: He's not worth it.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.720
This...

01:51.400 --> 01:54.920
This is not over. You hear me?

01:57.240 --> 01:58.840
This is not over.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.280
ADDISON: He's drunk.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.960
I better make sure he gets back to his boat OK.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.800
NAOMI: So, are we going out or not?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.280
Tosh, come on.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.560
Forget about what's happened. We're supposed

02:30.320 --> 02:32.560
to be celebrating.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.000
I know, why don't we go on ahead

02:36.040 --> 02:38.360
then give you some time to calm down

02:36.040 --> 02:38.360
and you can meet us there?

02:38.640 --> 02:39.720
SAM: Yeah?

02:40.600 --> 02:42.200
Promise me you won't go on Newton's boat.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, I promise, I promise.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.840
NAOMI: See you later.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.640
-Hi. -Hi.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.360
-He'll be here in a bit.

03:17.680 --> 03:20.080
-I'm gonna get some drinks. -Mmm-hmm.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.760
It's been 45 minutes. Where is he and why isn't

03:30.640 --> 03:33.760
he answering his phone?

03:34.680 --> 03:37.040
Well, you know what my dad's like

03:34.680 --> 03:37.040
when he gets in a mood.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.920
Oh, this is him now. Tosh?

03:44.120 --> 03:46.040
Tosh

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
He's on Newton's boat. He says he's being stabbed.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.040
NAOMI: Call an ambulance!

04:01.080 --> 04:03.160
SAM: Uh, right, you wait here, Naomi.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.760
Addison, you come with me.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.240
Dad! Dad, are you in there?

04:17.880 --> 04:20.280
-No one's here. -I'll look out front.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.000
Nothing.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.920
He's not there. No one is.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.440
DWAYNE: Somebody call about a stabbing?

04:43.480 --> 04:47.920
Yeah, that was us. Um, we're not sure

04:43.480 --> 04:47.920
what's happened.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.320
Where is he?

05:36.880 --> 05:38.720
-Good morning, sir. -Morning, Florence.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.680
Whoa, you're hungry.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.720
Oh, yes. It's JP's stag do tonight.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.160
So I thought I better start lining my stomach ASAP.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.000
You think it's going to be boozy?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.960
With Dwayne in charge, it could be carnage.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.200
How about you

05:52.240 --> 05:54.200
A body's been found washed up on the beach

05:52.240 --> 05:54.200
at Blue Bay Cove.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.600
Dwayne and JP are already there.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.280
Not a moment to lose, Florence. Er, um...

05:58.880 --> 06:00.560
-Yes, I think so.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.800
I don't want to overdo it.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.400
All right, let's go.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.880
Just one more.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.920
Morning, JP.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.040
Morning, Sir. Sarge. Body's just this way.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.320
HUMPHREY: So, JP, excited about

06:30.080 --> 06:33.320
tonight's festivities?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.400
Oh, yes, sir, very much.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.920
Can't wait to find out what Dwayne has

06:35.440 --> 06:37.920
in store for me.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.000
Yes, I bet. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Eh?

06:42.480 --> 06:43.800
-Ah, Dwayne. -Ah, Chief.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.600
What have we got?

06:45.640 --> 06:48.040
Well, the driver's licence says the victim's name

06:45.640 --> 06:48.040
is Tosh Walker.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.800
52 years of age from the UK. But the thing you

06:48.080 --> 06:51.800
should know is, Chief,

06:51.840 --> 06:54.480
is that me and JP got a call out to the harbour last night.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.240
JP: Yes, the victim's wife and son

06:54.520 --> 06:57.240
thought he'd been stabbed.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.880
You see, yesterday afternoon,

06:58.920 --> 07:00.800
Mr Walker had a run-in with a man called

06:58.920 --> 07:00.800
Newton Farrell.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.440
HUMPHREY: Who is?

07:02.480 --> 07:04.640
He lives on the harbour. Bit of a no mark,

07:02.480 --> 07:04.640
if you ask me.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.000
And he love a drink.

07:06.440 --> 07:10.000
Then later on, at 7:45, Mrs Walker gets a call

07:06.440 --> 07:10.000
from her husband.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.480
When she answered it, all Mr Walker said was,

07:12.520 --> 07:13.720
"Newton stabbed me."

07:14.120 --> 07:16.280
When she asked him where he was,

07:14.120 --> 07:16.280
he said, "His boat."

07:16.640 --> 07:18.560
His son called an ambulance straight away.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.120
When it arrived five minutes later, Farrell nor Walker

07:18.600 --> 07:21.120
could be found,

07:21.280 --> 07:23.040
which is when we arrived.

07:23.080 --> 07:26.880
Definitely a stabbing, Sir. I'd say a 3cm width blade.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.520
And there are marks at one end of the wound.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.240
-Possibly.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.720
It looks like it pierced the heart.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.680
-He'd have died pretty quickly.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.320
HUMPHREY: So the last anyone heard

07:39.160 --> 07:41.320
from Tosh Walker

07:41.360 --> 07:43.160
was that he'd been stabbed on Newton's boat.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.400
JP: That's great.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.960
HUMPHREY: 12 hours later,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.640
he washes up here with a knife wound

07:46.000 --> 07:47.640
in his chest.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.960
Looks like this one could be done and dusted by lunchtime.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.920
Sir, that was one of the fishermen we spoke to

07:50.000 --> 07:53.920
last night in the harbour.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.800
He was on his way back from a morning catch

07:55.840 --> 07:58.280
when he spotted Newton Farrell.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.600
Lunchtime!

07:59.640 --> 08:04.160
Yes, yes, all right, Dwayne. So, where is he?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.080
You want us to go and arrest him, Chief?

08:10.120 --> 08:11.520
HUMPHREY: No, not just yet.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.600
Let's see what he's got to say for himself, first.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.560
Good morning, Humphrey. Florence.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.040
Catherine.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.160
Detective Inspector Goodman and Detective

08:21.400 --> 08:24.160
Sergeant Cassell.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.800
Would you mind telling us where you were

08:25.840 --> 08:27.800
yesterday evening at around quarter to eight?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.400
Why you want to know that?

08:29.440 --> 08:32.080
Tosh Walker's body washed up on the beach, this morning.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.800
He'd been stabbed.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.840
In the last phone call he made to his wife,

08:35.880 --> 08:38.080
at quarter to eight yesterday evening,

08:38.120 --> 08:40.160
he said he was on your boat and that you stabbed him.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.720
How do you explain that?

08:42.120 --> 08:45.360
Sorry, Humphrey, but are you sure

08:42.120 --> 08:45.360
about the time?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.280
Yes, positive, Catherine.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.440
It's just Newton was here at quarter to eight.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.520
Sorry?

08:51.800 --> 08:54.880
Newton was here at quarter to eight.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.560
Really?

08:56.600 --> 08:59.160
He arrived at 7:30 and was here

08:56.600 --> 08:59.160
most of the evening.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.600
<i>I remember I had been</i> <i>talking to a friend of mine.</i>

09:02.640 --> 09:04.800
<i>She hadn't realised the time</i> <i>and said she had to go.</i>

09:04.840 --> 09:07.920
<i>As she left, Newton arrived.</i>

09:07.960 --> 09:10.400
<i>It was half past seven,</i> <i>I'm sure of it.</i>

09:10.440 --> 09:11.600
Rum.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.880
-Five past ten.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.280
So you were here yesterday evening at 7:45?

09:24.880 --> 09:26.000
Yes, I was.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.000
So why would Tosh claim you stabbed him?

09:29.160 --> 09:30.560
I don't know.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.640
I don't know why he would say a thing like that.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.640
Right.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, that's all our questions for now, Mr Farrell.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.600
As we suspect your boat is a possible crime scene,

09:40.640 --> 09:43.040
my officers will need to carry out a full search.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.720
You'll need to be there with them.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.360
OK.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.800
OK. Catherine.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.760
He may have an alibi,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.040
but he's certainly not behaving like he's innocent.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.600
My colleague said that your husband and Mr Farrell

10:04.880 --> 10:08.600
had a "falling out".

10:09.600 --> 10:11.640
Can you tell us what it was about?

10:12.680 --> 10:15.360
Professional jealousy. Newton never liked Tosh.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.920
They have known each other for a while, then.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.160
Newton's in the same business as us, marine salvage.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.600
He and Dad met about eight years ago

10:20.200 --> 10:23.600
off the Miami coast.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.200
They were searching for the same shipwreck,

10:25.240 --> 10:27.320
but Dad got there first, reaped the rewards

10:27.360 --> 10:29.240
and Newton's held it against him ever since.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.520
What was the argument about yesterday evening?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.680
The Santa Ana silver.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.840
Sorry, um...

10:36.840 --> 10:38.920
But what is the Santa Ana silver?

10:39.240 --> 10:42.080
It's a hoard of around 200 rare antique silver coins.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.360
Sorry, do you mean like actual treasure?

10:46.320 --> 10:48.080
It's not quite the terminology we'd use,

10:48.120 --> 10:50.680
but in layman's terms, yeah, treasure.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.920
And that's why you're here, to find the silver.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.000
Well, we've already found it.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.200
Brilliant!

10:59.120 --> 11:00.960
We began the recovery last week.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.600
Yesterday afternoon, we completed our final dive.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.880
Gosh, wow! Congratulations.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.120
How much, um...

11:08.160 --> 11:09.600
If you don't mind me asking, how much is it worth?

11:09.640 --> 11:13.120
Er, the estimated value is about £300,000.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.840
And Newton Farrell was annoyed by Mr Walker's success again?

11:19.560 --> 11:23.400
Newton claims to have been searching for the Santa Ana

11:19.560 --> 11:23.400
silver for years now.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.800
But the truth is,

11:24.840 --> 11:26.480
he's been drinking himself into an early grave.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.440
When my dad swept in and found it in

11:26.520 --> 11:28.440
less than a month

11:28.480 --> 11:29.520
it was just...

11:29.560 --> 11:31.520
Like history repeating itself?

11:31.560 --> 11:34.040
And this is why you think he killed Tosh?

11:35.480 --> 11:39.080
Er, could you talk us through exactly

11:35.480 --> 11:39.080
what happened yesterday?

11:40.640 --> 11:42.040
It was late afternoon.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.640
Walker!

11:43.680 --> 11:45.480
NAOMI: <i> And Newton turned up</i> <i>very drunk and very angry.</i>

11:46.520 --> 11:47.960
It's not the first time.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.000
NEWTON: <i> Tosh Walker!</i>

11:50.240 --> 11:52.760
SAM: <i> Word had got out</i> <i>that we'd completed</i>

11:50.240 --> 11:52.760
<i>recovery of the silver.</i>

11:52.800 --> 11:54.040
I heard about your little find!

11:54.080 --> 11:55.200
So he came looking for Dad.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.080
I found that silver fair and square.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.840
There was nothing fair about what you did.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.200
Ended up punching him.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.480
Ah!

12:02.440 --> 12:03.640
Just before we left, he said...

12:03.840 --> 12:05.320
This...

12:05.520 --> 12:06.760
This is not over.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.480
And what happened then?

12:08.680 --> 12:11.040
Newton went back to his boat, I went with him.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.200
How was he?

12:12.280 --> 12:15.040
Your father is a cheat! And a liar!

12:15.400 --> 12:17.600
SAM: <i> I had to give him a drink</i> <i>to calm him down.</i>

12:17.640 --> 12:21.880
-He stole my life. -All right.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.880
Just take a seat there.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.240
<i>But then,</i> <i>by the time I'd left,</i>

12:21.920 --> 12:24.240
<i>he'd crashed out.</i>

12:25.400 --> 12:29.320
And when was it the, um, spat reignited?

12:30.320 --> 12:31.400
So are we going out or not?

12:31.920 --> 12:33.800
NAOMI: <i>It was about seven o'clock.</i>

12:33.840 --> 12:36.400
<i>We were supposed</i> <i>to be going out,</i>

12:33.840 --> 12:36.400
<i>but Tosh was still stewing,</i>

12:36.440 --> 12:40.520
<i>so Sam and I left him</i> <i>to cool down and told him</i>

12:36.440 --> 12:40.520
<i>to meet us at the bar.</i>

12:41.280 --> 12:43.040
And then at about quarter to eight...

12:44.880 --> 12:47.000
This is him now. Tosh?

12:47.280 --> 12:50.200
I got a phone call from Tosh saying that he'd been stabbed

12:50.240 --> 12:51.400
and he was on Newton's boat.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.280
And by the time we got there, five minutes later,

12:55.320 --> 12:56.960
there was no sign of either of them.

12:57.160 --> 13:01.400
You are going to arrest him

12:57.160 --> 13:01.400
I mean, it has to be him.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.720
Um, yes, the evidence is very compelling,

13:04.760 --> 13:06.520
Mrs Walker, I must admit.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.120
But you see we've already spoken to Mr Farrell

13:10.720 --> 13:15.320
and it would seem that he has an alibi

13:10.720 --> 13:15.320
for the time of the murder.

13:15.360 --> 13:20.000
He was at Catherine's bar last night,

13:15.360 --> 13:20.000
from 7:30 onwards.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.920
That's impossible.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.480
I'm afraid it would appear not.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.040
Is that bleach I can smell?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.800
Did you mop this floor?

13:41.840 --> 13:44.520
Nothing wrong in me keeping my place ship

13:45.080 --> 13:46.200
Not at all.

13:47.160 --> 13:53.600
It's just that everything else in here

13:47.160 --> 13:53.600
is full of dust and grime.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.840
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.000
HUMPHREY: <i> My goodness.</i>

14:05.040 --> 14:06.960
According to this,

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
there's an estimated £35 billion worth of treasure,

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
lying on the seabed.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.720
Oh, really?

14:12.960 --> 14:15.200
I know. Just think of it.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.960
All those doubloons and pieces of eight

14:15.720 --> 14:19.960
just lying there.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.800
Oh, I used to be a bit of a numismatist

14:22.360 --> 14:24.800
when I was younger.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.440
Sorry, a what?

14:26.480 --> 14:27.960
Oh, I collected coins, yes.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.640
Although, it wasn't an extensive collection.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.760
I was only 11 at the time.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.920
But, um, well...

14:34.120 --> 14:35.960
Yes, anyway, that's me.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.760
But what about our professional collector,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.760
Tosh Walker?

14:38.800 --> 14:40.480
What have we got on him?

14:40.520 --> 14:44.160
Well, sir, he is 52 years of age

14:40.520 --> 14:44.160
and a marine salvage hunter.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.360
Originally from Donegal, Ireland,

14:46.640 --> 14:49.800
left school at 16 to work on the trawlers.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.560
Moved into salvaging in his early 30s.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.480
Arrived in Saint Marie a month ago

14:54.840 --> 14:56.920
to begin the search for the Santa Ana silver.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.640
And what of the people with him?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.720
OK, so there is Tosh's wife, Naomi Walker.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.920
She's 37.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.040
Worked as a hair dresser on cruise ships.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.520
Became the second Mrs Walker five years ago.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.440
And I've put a call in to Mr Walker's solicitor

15:10.480 --> 15:12.600
to find out who inherits his estate.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.040
Good idea.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.680
And there is Tosh's son from his first marriage,

15:14.400 --> 15:17.680
Samuel Walker.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.920
He's 25.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.440
Studied marine archaeology at Southampton University.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.120
Followed his father into the family business.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.240
Arrived on the island three months ago

15:26.280 --> 15:28.840
to set up the Santa Ana salvage operation.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.400
And there is a deckhand, Addison Patrick.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.600
18 years old. Local.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.760
Normally works with his father, a fisherman,

15:35.800 --> 15:38.800
but joined Tosh's salvage operation,

15:35.800 --> 15:38.800
three weeks ago.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.360
I see. Well, none of them are exactly steeped

15:39.000 --> 15:42.360
in motive, are they?

15:42.600 --> 15:45.040
And as they were all together in the harbour bar

15:45.080 --> 15:47.880
when the call came through from Tosh at 7:45,

15:48.400 --> 15:51.200
I'm not sure how any of them could have done it.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.200
Which leaves us with Newton Farrell.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.840
Who is 48 years of age.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.760
Born and raised on the island.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.960
Been trying to make a living out of marine salvage

15:57.200 --> 15:59.960
most of his life.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.480
Yes. So Mr Farrell is our prime suspect.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.360
He has motive. He's aggrieved

16:02.880 --> 16:05.360
that Tosh Walker

16:05.400 --> 16:07.800
recovered the treasure that he believes

16:05.400 --> 16:07.800
was rightfully his.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.400
And on the night of the murder,

16:09.440 --> 16:11.240
Tosh Walker made a call to his wife

16:11.280 --> 16:14.320
in which he told her that Newton had stabbed him.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.840
And as we know he died extremely quickly.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.800
The knifing must have taken place in the moments

16:17.000 --> 16:20.800
before the phone call.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.400
When we questioned Newton this morning,

16:23.160 --> 16:26.600
his behaviour was, as you would say, "shifty."

16:26.880 --> 16:28.240
Shifty indeed, Florence.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.880
All of which seems to suggest that he is our killer,

16:30.920 --> 16:32.880
except for the fact that he was witnessed

16:32.920 --> 16:34.680
at Catherine's bar at the time of the murder.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.440
Which just doesn't make sense.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.760
If it wasn't Newton who stabbed him,

16:38.800 --> 16:41.200
then why did Tosh tell his wife that it was.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.280
Unless it wasn't Tosh making the call?

16:44.320 --> 16:46.160
Someone else trying to frame Newton?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.560
Maybe.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.720
-I'll get that.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.360
JP: So, uh, Dwayne. DWAYNE: Uh

16:59.600 --> 17:01.160
I was wondering when you were going to tell me

17:01.200 --> 17:02.640
what we're up to tonight.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.080
I can't do that.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.040
It would spoil the surprise.

17:08.080 --> 17:11.240
But when you say, "a surprise"...

17:16.320 --> 17:18.920
Ah! What have we here?

17:19.920 --> 17:21.320
That's a knife sheath.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.440
With no sign of the knife that goes in it.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.400
Hmm.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.760
OK, that's great. You've been very helpful.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.760
Thank you.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.520
And what did he have to say?

17:42.880 --> 17:46.400
The estate is divided equally between Tosh's wife

17:42.880 --> 17:46.400
and his son.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.360
Not that there's much to share out.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.920
Oh?

17:50.240 --> 17:52.280
Well, the salvage business has been struggling

17:50.240 --> 17:52.280
for over a year.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.240
But the discovery of the Santa Ana silver

17:54.280 --> 17:55.720
puts them back in the black again.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.560
True.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.640
But the solicitor also told me that Tosh contacted him

17:57.800 --> 18:00.640
six months ago

18:00.680 --> 18:02.400
to discuss filing for divorce.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.080
Really?

18:04.120 --> 18:05.840
He sent the application papers to Tosh

18:04.120 --> 18:05.840
but never got them back.

18:06.160 --> 18:09.560
I see. And on what grounds did he want a divorce?

18:09.600 --> 18:12.320
He suspected his wife of having an affair.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.640
Hmm.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.320
It really isn't quite how it seems.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.000
So how is it?

18:19.040 --> 18:21.880
I knew Tosh had requested the divorce papers.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.480
He showed them to me.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.800
He accused you of having an affair.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.920
I wasn't having an affair.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.560
But I can understand why he thought I was.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.840
I had a health scare about a year ago.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.120
I never told Tosh.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.080
Why not?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.120
He wasn't very good at dealing with

18:38.400 --> 18:40.120
those kind of things.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.600
And don't get me wrong,

18:43.040 --> 18:44.600
I loved Tosh very much.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.040
He was an amazing and exciting man to be with.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.760
But he wasn't brilliant at dealing with things

18:48.160 --> 18:50.760
that he couldn't control.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.920
It made him feel vulnerable and he didn't

18:50.880 --> 18:53.920
like that at all.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.960
Knowing you were ill would have had that effect?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.840
Yeah.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.200
And when that happened, he wasn't a particularly

18:57.880 --> 19:00.200
nice man to be around.

19:00.240 --> 19:05.440
So, I thought it was best for both of us that I just

19:00.240 --> 19:05.440
dealt with it all on my own.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.880
Except he started to think you were having an affair.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.040
I was sneaking off to hospital twice a week,

19:12.080 --> 19:15.160
receiving secretive phone calls

19:12.080 --> 19:15.160
about test results.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.360
I can understand why he came to

19:15.200 --> 19:17.360
the conclusion he did.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.480
-That's all it was, really.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.240
Just an empty threat. In the end I confessed.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.720
Told him I'd been ill

19:26.760 --> 19:28.320
but that everything was going to be OK.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.920
HUMPHREY: How'd he take it?

19:29.960 --> 19:31.760
He was relieved I wasn't seeing someone else

19:31.800 --> 19:33.480
but hurt I didn't tell him the truth.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.400
And everything was fine between you both since then?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.280
Yeah, it was.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.560
It really was.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.120
All his stuff's here, so just feel free to...

20:03.840 --> 20:07.320
-4132.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.520
Oh, er, Mrs Walker, um, just wanted to check,

20:10.960 --> 20:12.640
you're sure it was Tosh who phoned you last night?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.800
It couldn't have been someone else pretending

20:13.480 --> 20:15.800
to be him, perhaps?

20:16.320 --> 20:19.560
Of course it was him. I know my own husband's voice.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.760
Yes. Yes, of course.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.080
Whoa! Would you look at that?

20:35.440 --> 20:38.800
The Santa Ana silver.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.320
Are you sure it's OK to touch them?

20:41.360 --> 20:44.280
Remember, Florence, I know my way

20:41.360 --> 20:44.280
around old coins.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.160
It's really quite something.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.640
Barely a scratch on it. It's virtually mint.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.400
Uh-oh.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.760
Divorce application form.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.480
It looks like it was completed,

21:02.280 --> 21:05.480
but Tosh never signed.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.960
So maybe Naomi's telling the truth

21:06.200 --> 21:09.960
and it was a threat Tosh made

21:10.000 --> 21:11.240
but never acted on.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.920
Ah, there you are. Don't worry it's fine.

21:14.600 --> 21:19.600
Or, Florence, maybe she killed Tosh before

21:14.600 --> 21:19.600
he had a chance to sign them.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.280
We should take this laptop.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.440
Dwayne, how can I help?

21:26.760 --> 21:28.240
Right, on our way.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.400
They're ready for us on Newton's boat.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.320
Boats, boats, boats!

21:39.920 --> 21:41.560
OK, Chief, so the first thing you should know

21:41.600 --> 21:43.680
is that Newton definitely had a clean-up in there.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.280
The cabin floor has been mopped

21:44.120 --> 21:46.280
thoroughly with bleach.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.280
-DWAYNE: No traces of blood.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.920
But suspicious behaviour, nonetheless. What else?

21:52.120 --> 21:55.000
We found this. Sheath for a diver's knife.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.480
But no knife.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.360
And I checked with the guy who runs the fishing shop

21:58.400 --> 21:59.520
in the harbour.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.720
This particular make of case

22:01.760 --> 22:04.720
would normally hold a three centimetre width

22:01.760 --> 22:04.720
serrated diver's knife.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.840
Same as the one used to kill Tosh.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.840
FLORENCE: So, no sign of Tosh's mobile phone here?

22:09.880 --> 22:13.200
Afraid not, it must have been thrown

22:09.880 --> 22:13.200
into the sea with his body.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.080
-Tweezers, please. -Yes.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.200
Thank you.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.320
A-ha!

22:26.520 --> 22:27.800
What is it?

22:28.000 --> 22:31.120
It's a cheroot, Florence, like the ones Tosh smoked.

22:41.320 --> 22:46.520
So, tell us Mr Farrell, why did you mop the floor

22:41.320 --> 22:46.520
of your boat?

22:47.160 --> 22:49.160
It was dirty, so I cleaned it.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.440
And you were happy for the rest of the cabin

22:49.360 --> 22:51.440
to remain dirty.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.240
I was going to clean the rest later.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.400
FLORENCE: Does this belong to you?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.160
Yes, it's mine.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.920
So where is the knife that should sit in it?

23:03.240 --> 23:04.680
I lost it a few months ago.

23:05.280 --> 23:08.040
FLORENCE: Only the knife that was

23:05.280 --> 23:08.040
used to kill Tosh Walker

23:08.080 --> 23:11.960
is the exact style of knife that would fit in this.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.000
Must be a coincidence, hmm?

23:14.040 --> 23:15.280
Yes, must be.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.680
Mmm.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.160
OK, let's try this last one on for size.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.080
Tosh Walker. When was the last time

23:19.200 --> 23:22.080
he was on your boat?

23:22.640 --> 23:25.200
He wasn't. I mean, he has never been on my boat.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.760
-This didn't

23:25.240 --> 23:28.760
belong to him, then?

23:30.480 --> 23:32.360
Tosh Walker smoked cheroots.

23:32.520 --> 23:33.720
I mean, we'll have to get it down to the lab

23:33.760 --> 23:35.360
to see if it's got his DNA on it.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.000
-But, uh... -FLORENCE:

23:35.400 --> 23:37.000
But if it did belong to him,

23:37.040 --> 23:39.720
that means he probably had been on board your boat.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.680
Yes, and with the mopping and this,

23:41.720 --> 23:43.720
and uh... Oh, yes, let's not forget

23:41.720 --> 23:43.720
the phone call

23:43.760 --> 23:45.360
he made to his wife saying you stabbed him.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.720
And the fact that you had a very strong motive

23:45.560 --> 23:47.720
to kill him.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.680
HUMPHREY: Oh, yes, that's a good one as well.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.000
If we take all that into account,

23:52.040 --> 23:54.120
it's not looking too good, is it?

23:56.240 --> 23:59.960
But I was at Catherine's bar when it happened. Wasn't I?

24:02.040 --> 24:03.600
Anything else

24:16.520 --> 24:19.600
Oh, Florence, how are you getting on

24:16.520 --> 24:19.600
with Tosh Walker's laptop?

24:19.800 --> 24:23.400
There are some interesting emails between Mr Walker

24:19.800 --> 24:23.400
and his son, Sam,

24:23.440 --> 24:26.400
from when Sam was out here doing the prep

24:23.440 --> 24:26.400
for the salvage operation.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.760
Go on.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.800
It seems the original plan was that Sam would

24:28.800 --> 24:31.800
handle it all on his own.

24:31.840 --> 24:35.840
But Tosh was getting worried Sam wasn't making

24:31.840 --> 24:35.840
quick enough progress.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.120
So Tosh came out here to complete the job himself.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.800
Well, how was Sam about this?

24:39.840 --> 24:42.720
At first, he tried to convince Tosh he could manage.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.760
But in the end, he was quite accepting.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.560
I'll keep digging, see if there's more to it.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.000
Chief! I think I might have something.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.440
Yes, Dwayne?

24:51.480 --> 24:53.360
I've been going over Tosh Walker's phone records.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.840
The network provider sent them over,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.840
and you see this number here?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.960
-Mmm-hmm. -It's a Saint Marie landline.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.320
And it called Tosh Walker's mobile

24:58.000 --> 25:00.320
yesterday afternoon at 3:00.

25:00.720 --> 25:04.280
Anyway, I traced the number and it belongs to

25:00.720 --> 25:04.280
Jimmy the Fence.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.560
Jimmy the Fence?

25:06.600 --> 25:09.600
Yes, Chief, if you've got something

25:06.600 --> 25:09.600
that you maybe should not have

25:09.640 --> 25:12.560
and you want to get rid of it, then he's your man.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.480
I'll bear that in mind, Dwayne.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.520
And so what was Jimmy the Fence

25:14.520 --> 25:17.520
doing calling Tosh Walker

25:17.560 --> 25:19.160
only a few hours before he was killed?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.320
Well, hopefully, we'll be able to find out.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.800
I left a message for Jimmy to call me

25:21.360 --> 25:23.800
as soon as he picks it up.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.080
OK. Right, well, it's getting on.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.680
I think we should officially call it a day.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.880
Some of us have a stag do to organise.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.520
Good call, Chief.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.400
Right!

25:37.320 --> 25:38.920
Now.

25:38.960 --> 25:39.960
JP.

25:40.320 --> 25:45.160
I'll be round to pick you up at 6pm sharp.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.320
Make sure you're ready.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.480
I don't think I want to go to my stag do.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.160
Don't worry, JP.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.560
I felt exactly like you did before my stag.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.560
I was terrified.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.400
And how was it?

26:01.720 --> 26:04.160
Oh, well, it was one of the single

26:01.720 --> 26:04.160
worst experiences of my life.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.040
But I'm sure that your stag do

26:04.200 --> 26:07.040
won't be like that.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.720
Look, the thing is.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.440
Why did you choose Dwayne to be your best man,

26:08.960 --> 26:11.440
in the first place?

26:11.680 --> 26:16.000
Well, that's easy. You know, he's my friend.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.160
My best friend, if I'm to be honest and...

26:18.200 --> 26:20.840
You know, he virtually saved my life once.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.560
So, put simply, you chose Dwayne because

26:21.160 --> 26:24.560
you know you can trust him.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.960
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.320
Yes. Thank you. OK.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.840
Sarge, um, see you later.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.680
-I'd say so.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.440
But enough of JP's stag night. I want to hear

26:43.560 --> 26:47.440
what happened on yours.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.920
Believe me, Florence, you do not.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.920
And you know what they say,

26:50.960 --> 26:53.800
"What goes on the stag, stays on the stag."

26:53.840 --> 26:56.520
God help JP!

26:58.080 --> 27:00.560
DWAYNE: Come on. JP: Where are we, Dwayne?

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
DWAYNE: You'll find out when you find out.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.840
-I don't like this. -Keep moving.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.480
-Ah. -Just a few more steps, man.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.040
I shouldn't have done this thing, man.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.080
-Hey, stop! -That's nothing, man.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.080
Keep going.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.640
-Dwayne... -OK!

27:13.200 --> 27:14.880
So you're ready for your stag do to begin?

27:14.920 --> 27:19.560
-No! -Good. Three! Two! One!

27:19.600 --> 27:20.920
<i>Voila!</i>

27:22.680 --> 27:24.280
ALL: Surprise!

27:27.000 --> 27:27.960
You tricked me!

27:28.000 --> 27:29.240
-Yes, you!

27:29.280 --> 27:32.640
-No! -Hey! This is amazing, Dwayne!

27:32.680 --> 27:34.200
Go enjoy yourself!

27:34.240 --> 27:36.640
JP: Hey, man! Yes, boy!

27:39.400 --> 27:41.560
MC Humph has the tunes.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.200
-Oh, gosh,

27:43.480 --> 27:46.200
um, personal choice, um...

27:46.240 --> 27:47.880
<i></i>

27:48.520 --> 27:50.960
-Bit embarrassing, er...

27:51.160 --> 27:53.240
-Right.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.600
Right.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.320
-Yes.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.160
Well, I must say, Dwayne, it's absolutely fantastic.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.120
DWAYNE: Well, you know what I thought?

28:04.160 --> 28:07.240
I thought, "What would JP enjoy most on his stag night?"

28:07.600 --> 28:11.880
Then it hit me. Beer and prawns on the beach

28:07.600 --> 28:11.880
with his best friends.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.600
Proper island style!

28:13.640 --> 28:17.760
Aw, man, Dwayne, this is perfect.

28:13.640 --> 28:17.760
Thank you, man.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.320
But if you really want to thank me,

28:19.360 --> 28:21.360
why don't you go and get us a couple of beers, now?

28:21.400 --> 28:23.320
Hey, man, OK.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.280
-No really, Dwayne, well done. -Thank you, Chief.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.600
Not a stripper in sight, eh?

28:27.640 --> 28:28.680
Not yet.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.000
No, you haven't, have you?

28:32.440 --> 28:33.640
Look who's just turned up.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.200
The stripper?

28:36.760 --> 28:37.920
Good evening, gentlemen.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.840
Oh, lord. Commissioner.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.920
Quite the party.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.880
Yes, it's, uh, JP's stag, sir. Dwayne organised it.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.080
Yes.

28:48.840 --> 28:51.320
Very impressive, Officer Myers.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.080
Thank you, Commissioner.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.120
Well, I don't intend to interrupt

28:53.120 --> 28:56.120
the proceedings for too long

28:56.160 --> 28:59.480
but I wondered if I might have a minute of your time,

28:56.160 --> 28:59.480
Inspector.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.200
Yes, of course, sir.

29:19.160 --> 29:24.320
I believe Newton Farrell is a suspect in the

29:19.160 --> 29:24.320
Tosh Walker murder case?

29:24.360 --> 29:27.560
Yes, sir, quite a strong suspect.

29:24.360 --> 29:27.560
Do you know him?

29:27.600 --> 29:30.960
Not personally. But I know of his reputation.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.160
You, perhaps, aren't aware,

29:33.200 --> 29:36.120
but as well as being Commissioner of Police,

29:36.160 --> 29:40.720
I am also chairman of the Saint Marie Cultural

29:36.160 --> 29:40.720
and Heritage Commission.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.400
You are?

29:42.960 --> 29:45.720
Hmm, where do you find the time, sir?

29:48.040 --> 29:50.400
The Commission firmly believe

29:50.880 --> 29:53.760
that the rightful home for the Santa Ana silver

29:53.800 --> 29:56.360
is in a museum on this island.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.280
When we found out, a few years ago,

29:59.480 --> 30:04.560
that Newton Farrell managed to get hold of documents

29:59.480 --> 30:04.560
outlining its location,

30:05.120 --> 30:07.480
we were disappointed, to say the least.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.800
And since, unsurprisingly,

30:10.840 --> 30:14.960
Mr Farrell, in the intervening years, has drunk

30:10.840 --> 30:14.960
himself into a stupor,

30:15.280 --> 30:19.360
Tosh Walker seized his opportunity and claimed

30:15.280 --> 30:19.360
the silver for himself.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.560
You and the board must be very disappointed, sir.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.240
It's the people of Saint Marie we feel for the most.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.320
I'd be grateful if you would keep me abreast

30:25.800 --> 30:29.320
of any developments

30:29.360 --> 30:30.800
regarding Newton Farrell.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.960
Yes. Yes, of course, sir.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.560
I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.920
Yes, thank you, sir. Um...

30:44.200 --> 30:47.240
Would you like to, uh, join us?

30:47.560 --> 30:49.800
No, I think not.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.120
Are you ever going to be attending your own stag do?

31:07.640 --> 31:09.920
Kinda like my life the way it is, you know.

31:09.960 --> 31:13.560
No too many responsibilities. And being here tonight,

31:14.360 --> 31:20.320
good friends, good food, glass of rum

31:14.360 --> 31:20.320
and that sunset...

31:21.360 --> 31:23.360
What more could a man want, eh?

31:25.320 --> 31:27.600
What more indeed?

31:27.640 --> 31:29.160
JP: OK!

31:30.480 --> 31:31.720
Another rum?

31:31.760 --> 31:33.160
-Hit me. -Yes.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.440
Another rum.

31:34.480 --> 31:35.840
This is the best, JP. This is the best.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.800
-To JP. -Quite right, quite right.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.800
To JP!

31:38.840 --> 31:40.480
-JP! -JP!

31:43.680 --> 31:45.760
Ahh!

31:45.800 --> 31:49.520
Oh, let me let you in on a secret.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.720
DWAYNE: Hmm?

31:50.760 --> 31:53.520
You know how you tricked me earlier?

31:53.560 --> 31:57.080
You see that bootleg rum Francois bought earlier?

31:57.120 --> 31:59.280
-Yes, 99% proof.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.280
-99%, yes. -Mmm-hmm.

32:01.320 --> 32:05.000
I made sure that every time I got the rums in,

32:05.600 --> 32:08.480
I gave you directly from that bottle.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.560
Yes.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.920
-OK.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.600
-I know.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.640
Which is why I made sure

32:17.680 --> 32:20.680
I swapped drinks every time you gave me one.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.120
Then, who did you swap it with then?

32:27.600 --> 32:28.920
Cheers.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.160
Now this you have got to try.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.800
No, no. No, thank you, sir. No more food. Please.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.480
Ah, has that been fried as well?

32:53.920 --> 32:55.360
It's barely touched the pan, Dwayne.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.120
Sir, you know you can't fry everything?

32:57.440 --> 32:59.720
This is a full English breakfast.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.800
It is the only guaranteed hangover cure there is,

33:01.840 --> 33:03.920
and in my opinion,

33:03.960 --> 33:07.720
the most important cultural contribution my country

33:03.960 --> 33:07.720
has ever given to the world. -I don't know how

33:08.680 --> 33:12.440
he does it, either.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.720
Oh, I better get this, Chief. It's Jimmy the Fence.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.800
-OK. -Jimmy. Sarge. Yes.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.560
-Morning, sir. -Morning, Florence.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.920
JP.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.600
So how are we this morning?

33:25.680 --> 33:27.200
Couldn't be better, frankly.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.200
Yes, the Inspector was right to tell me to trust Dwayne.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.320
It was truly the best night ever.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.080
It was?

33:34.280 --> 33:36.800
Florence, could I interest you in some fried eggs

33:34.280 --> 33:36.800
and a sausage?

33:37.040 --> 33:38.200
Or some fried bread?

33:38.760 --> 33:43.240
That sounds delicious, but I've had breakfast.

33:38.760 --> 33:43.240
Thank you.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.880
Chief! Chief! I just spoke to Jimmy.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.600
Apparently, Tosh Walker had visited him five days ago.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.040
Now Tosh told Jimmy

33:54.080 --> 33:58.080
that someone was going to come and try and sell him

33:54.080 --> 33:58.080
some antique silver coins.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.160
He asked Jimmy to call him if that happened,

34:00.200 --> 34:01.520
and he would see him all right.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.760
-Yes, Chief.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.440
That's why Jimmy called Tosh on the day he was murdered.

34:06.920 --> 34:11.000
Jimmy had been visited by someone trying to

34:06.920 --> 34:11.000
offload 15 silver coins

34:11.040 --> 34:13.080
stolen from the Santa Ana hoard.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.280
Who was it?

34:14.320 --> 34:17.040
The deckhand, Addison Patrick.

34:27.240 --> 34:31.120
Addison? We're wondering if we could

34:27.240 --> 34:31.120
ask you a few questions.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.480
Uh, sure. Dad, just give us a minute.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.520
We spoke to a friend of yours this morning.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.120
A man called Jimmy the Fence.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.800
He passed on to us some rather

34:46.960 --> 34:49.800
interesting information

34:49.840 --> 34:51.920
about you and a handful of silver coins.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.680
Tosh was on to you, wasn't he?

34:57.240 --> 34:59.080
Did he threaten to go to the police?

34:59.760 --> 35:01.280
-Yes. -HUMPHREY: Addison.

35:01.320 --> 35:02.520
Did you stab Tosh Walker? No!

35:05.480 --> 35:06.640
I didn't!

35:07.480 --> 35:08.760
I wouldn't!

35:09.240 --> 35:10.560
So tell us what did happen?

35:16.840 --> 35:19.160
At first, I was only meant to take one coin

35:19.200 --> 35:20.920
as a souvenir for the first dive.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.080
TOSH: All right! Let's count this lot.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.000
ADDISON: <i> Didn't think</i> <i>anyone would notice.</i>

35:28.400 --> 35:29.440
And when they didn't...

35:29.520 --> 35:30.760
You took a few more?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.360
It seemed like easy money.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.640
So what happened?

35:36.240 --> 35:38.240
I asked Tosh if I could stay working with him.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.720
Thought I was on to a good thing.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.080
Earning a wage and taking a little extra on the side.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.200
But he knew what I had done.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.640
Got a thirst for more riches, eh?

35:50.320 --> 35:55.480
The thing is, Addison, I don't normally

35:50.320 --> 35:55.480
employ thieves.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.680
ADDISON: <i>He said I had two options.</i>

35:58.760 --> 36:00.120
He could go to the police

36:00.240 --> 36:02.240
or I could give back what I had taken

36:00.240 --> 36:02.240
on the condition

36:02.280 --> 36:04.520
-he never clapped eyes on me again.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.000
I ran home to get the coins, came back to find Tosh,

36:07.040 --> 36:08.680
but him and Sam were having an argument.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.280
An argument?

36:10.440 --> 36:12.120
Thought I'd see him later, at the bar to give it to him.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.480
<i>But he never showed up.</i>

36:17.760 --> 36:19.000
Where's Tosh?

36:23.240 --> 36:26.800
When I heard Tosh died, I didn't know

36:23.240 --> 36:26.800
what to do with them.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.240
Here.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.720
This argument between Sam and Tosh,

36:29.800 --> 36:33.720
would you say it was serious?

36:34.200 --> 36:35.920
ADDISON: I think so.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.560
When I went in to see Tosh, he really didn't

36:36.320 --> 36:39.560
want me around.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.200
Your bright idea...

36:41.240 --> 36:43.720
Addison, not now! We are having this...

36:44.040 --> 36:45.640
Do you know what it was they were arguing about?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.480
I didn't hear it all.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.160
<i>But I know it was</i> <i>Tosh telling Sam</i>

36:50.200 --> 36:52.080
<i>that he didn't want him</i> <i>working with him any more.</i>

36:52.480 --> 36:55.080
<i>That after this job,</i> <i>they should go</i>

36:52.480 --> 36:55.080
<i>their separate ways.</i>

36:55.640 --> 36:57.040
He was letting Sam go?

36:57.200 --> 37:00.800
He said he felt he was holding

36:57.200 --> 37:00.800
the business back.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.200
Wasn't good enough.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.600
HUMPHREY: <i> How did Sam take it?</i>

37:05.600 --> 37:08.240
ADDISON: <i> He looked hurt.</i> <i>Really hurt.</i>

37:11.200 --> 37:13.000
Why didn't you mention this before, Addison?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.080
This is important information!

37:15.120 --> 37:18.680
Because it didn't have anything to do

37:15.120 --> 37:18.680
with Tosh's murder.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.200
Sam didn't kill Tosh. It was Newton Farrell.

37:27.360 --> 37:31.120
HUMPHREY: Mr Walker. We wondered if we might

37:27.360 --> 37:31.120
ask you a few questions.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.360
SAM: Sure.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.360
How did you feel when your father

37:34.800 --> 37:37.360
turned up on Saint Marie

37:37.400 --> 37:40.120
to help you find the Santa Ana silver?

37:40.200 --> 37:42.400
How did I feel? Um...

37:43.000 --> 37:46.600
I was pleased to see him. You know, he was my dad.

37:46.800 --> 37:47.840
Yes.

37:48.240 --> 37:51.040
It's just that we know that things hadn't been great

37:51.080 --> 37:53.040
between you and your father for a little while.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.680
What do you mean?

37:54.720 --> 37:57.320
We saw the emails between you both

37:54.720 --> 37:57.320
before Tosh came here.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.720
He wasn't supposed to be joining you, was he?

37:59.760 --> 38:02.640
You were intending to run the salvage operation yourself.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.080
But he didn't trust you to do it successfully.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.640
And then we find out on the day your

38:05.480 --> 38:07.640
father was killed,

38:07.680 --> 38:10.080
he fired you from the family business.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.240
It can't have been very pleasant for you?

38:14.840 --> 38:17.800
Er, no, it wasn't. Um...

38:17.840 --> 38:19.240
But it wasn't a surprise.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.680
You know, Dad had had his concerns

38:19.760 --> 38:22.680
about me for a while.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.120
You know, he said I didn't have enough drive

38:25.160 --> 38:26.920
or enough commitment.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.560
But he'd said it so many times before, it was water

38:27.080 --> 38:29.560
off a duck's back.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.680
What, even when he fired you

38:35.000 --> 38:37.200
You know how my father got hold of the documents

38:37.240 --> 38:40.240
indicating the location of the Santa Ana silver?

38:40.560 --> 38:43.000
He took Newton Farrell out to a bar and got him drunk

38:43.040 --> 38:44.720
and then had me sneak on to Newton's boat

38:44.760 --> 38:46.440
and make copies of them.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.720
That's what my father was like.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.160
You know, at best he was underhand

38:49.280 --> 38:52.160
and at worst he was...

38:52.920 --> 38:55.440
An unforgiving and ruthless man.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.600
So was I hurt that he thought I wasn't good enough

38:57.640 --> 38:59.440
to work alongside him? Uh, no.

39:00.280 --> 39:04.480
No, not if being good enough meant I had to be like him.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.960
So let's run through what we know.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.720
Addison Patrick stole from Tosh.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.720
But insists he was going to give the silver coins back.

39:14.040 --> 39:17.000
Naomi Walker lied to Tosh about her illness,

39:17.040 --> 39:18.320
but did come clean in the end.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.440
And while Sam Walker was sacked by Tosh,

39:20.960 --> 39:22.760
he had little respect for this father,

39:22.800 --> 39:26.040
seeming almost relieved that he got out of

39:22.800 --> 39:26.040
the family business.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.800
Hardly the most convincing set of reasons to

39:26.360 --> 39:29.800
commit murder, are they?

39:30.240 --> 39:31.800
-Which brings us back... -Once more...

39:32.120 --> 39:35.880
-To Newton Farrell. -Our prime suspect

39:32.120 --> 39:35.880
from the very start.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.600
Not only did he have the motive,

39:37.680 --> 39:40.800
but both the physical and circumstantial

39:37.680 --> 39:40.800
evidence is damning.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.840
But what we have to find out

39:43.880 --> 39:46.760
is how he stabbed the victim on his own boat,

39:46.800 --> 39:50.480
while at the same time he was witnessed

39:46.800 --> 39:50.480
drinking in a public bar,

39:50.520 --> 39:51.760
half a mile away.

39:57.040 --> 40:02.160
Newton, you've not touched your rum.

39:57.040 --> 40:02.160
That's not like you.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.440
Newton, is everything all right?

40:09.120 --> 40:11.360
I've done a bad thing, Catherine.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.880
A really bad thing.

40:15.720 --> 40:19.280
-Nothing.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.200
He just got up and walked away.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.120
I tried to get him to stay but he wouldn't listen.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.240
That's when I called you.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.560
Thank you for letting us know, Catherine.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.920
My pleasure.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.640
Newton Farrell is as guilty as sin, Florence.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.440
It's virtually a confession.

40:36.480 --> 40:40.400
Well, wait until you hear this, sir.

40:36.480 --> 40:40.400
That was the lab.

40:40.440 --> 40:44.520
That cheroot we found on Newton's boat.

40:40.440 --> 40:44.520
It did belong to Tosh Walker.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.280
His DNA was all over it.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.280
So Tosh was almost definitely on Newton's boat?

40:50.120 --> 40:53.120
They also found significant traces

40:50.120 --> 40:53.120
of Tosh's blood on it.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.680
So, do we arrest him?

40:57.600 --> 40:59.200
We arrest him.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.040
Don't try anything foolish, Newton.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.040
We got you covered.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.360
JP.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.080
Newton Farrell,

41:28.120 --> 41:31.760
I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Tosh Walker.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.600
Remember that cheroot stub we found on your boat?

41:39.640 --> 41:41.000
We got the lab to test it.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.920
Not only did they find Tosh's DNA on it,

41:42.960 --> 41:45.960
they also found significant traces

41:42.960 --> 41:45.960
of his blood on it, as well.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.240
Can you explain any of that?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.160
Yes, I killed Tosh Walker.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.040
Please don't try and deny it, Mr Farrell, we've got lots...

41:54.760 --> 41:55.960
Sorry, what?

41:56.360 --> 41:59.600
When Tosh Walker visited me, two nights ago,

41:59.640 --> 42:02.560
I stabbed him and disposed of his body.

42:04.760 --> 42:07.200
I see.  Well...

42:11.200 --> 42:13.520
Maybe you should talk us through it.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.600
Why don't you start at the beginning?

42:17.160 --> 42:19.200
We know you and Tosh argued that afternoon.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.880
There was nothing fair about what you did.

42:21.240 --> 42:22.400
Deal with it.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.520
So what happened then?

42:25.480 --> 42:28.240
When I left Tosh, I was still fuming.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.520
Sam caught up with me and walked me back to my boat.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.000
Tried to calm me down.

42:33.320 --> 42:36.960
<i>He handed me a drink.</i> <i>Probably the last thing</i>

42:33.320 --> 42:36.960
<i>I needed.</i>

42:37.920 --> 42:40.240
<i>I'd already had a skin full.</i>

42:41.120 --> 42:42.840
Next thing I know,

42:42.880 --> 42:45.760
I'm sat there in front of Tosh's dead body,

42:42.880 --> 42:45.760
a knife in my hand.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.920
<i>I felt sick!</i>

42:49.240 --> 42:51.040
<i>I panicked.</i>

42:51.080 --> 42:53.840
<i>The first thing</i> <i>that came into my head</i>

42:51.080 --> 42:53.840
<i>was get rid of the body.</i>

42:54.960 --> 42:56.600
<i>So I took the boat out.</i>

42:57.200 --> 42:58.960
Threw him over the side?

42:59.000 --> 43:00.320
Knife as well?

43:01.120 --> 43:02.360
Tosh's mobile?

43:02.480 --> 43:04.440
That must have been in his pocket.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.840
Then what'd you do?

43:06.200 --> 43:09.120
I brought the boat back into the harbour,

43:06.200 --> 43:09.120
cleaned it up.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.720
I mopped that floor as hard as I could.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.840
Then I went over to Catherine's bar.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.880
I never needed a drink so much in my life.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.280
You still don't remember the time you arrived

43:18.000 --> 43:20.280
at Catherine's bar?

43:20.640 --> 43:21.800
You said it was 7:30?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.080
Well, yeah, that's what Catherine told us.

43:24.200 --> 43:28.800
But we know that Tosh called his wife from your boat

43:24.200 --> 43:28.800
at 7:45, asking for help.

43:29.280 --> 43:33.080
Catherine must have got the time I arrived

43:29.280 --> 43:33.080
at the bar wrong.

43:33.800 --> 43:37.880
Yes,

43:33.800 --> 43:37.880
I suppose she must have.

43:38.400 --> 43:43.800
I know what I did that night, Inspector.

43:38.400 --> 43:43.800
I killed Tosh Walker.

43:44.760 --> 43:47.520
Now I must face the consequences of my actions.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.640
Sir, we're off. Are you coming?

44:09.920 --> 44:12.080
I might stay a little while longer.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.960
Something's bothering you?

44:14.080 --> 44:16.040
Yes, I'm not sure what.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.920
It's rather annoying, really.

44:19.080 --> 44:22.200
Chief, you've already got a confession.

44:19.080 --> 44:22.200
What more do you want?

44:23.120 --> 44:26.640
Yes, I... I know, but, it's just...

44:27.120 --> 44:29.800
How can it all boil down to Catherine getting

44:27.120 --> 44:29.800
the time wrong?

44:29.840 --> 44:32.320
I mean, it can't be as simple as that, can it?

44:32.440 --> 44:35.280
-Maybe it is. -And it does make

44:32.440 --> 44:35.280
the most sense.

44:35.320 --> 44:37.000
She was adamant,

44:37.040 --> 44:39.320
absolutely positive that Newton arrived

44:37.040 --> 44:39.320
at half past seven.

44:39.360 --> 44:43.360
But if that was true, then it means that

44:39.360 --> 44:43.360
Tosh Walker phoned his wife

44:43.400 --> 44:44.880
15 minutes after he died.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.800
-And that's not possible. -She's right, you know, Chief.

44:47.920 --> 44:51.120
And you and I both know that dead people

44:47.920 --> 44:51.120
don't send text messages.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.360
Or make phone calls!

44:53.560 --> 44:55.480
No, they don't. You're right, Dwayne.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.200
What if maybe they did?

45:02.600 --> 45:05.720
I mean, it's impossible, I agree.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.720
So he couldn't.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.160
But what if he could?

45:10.480 --> 45:13.160
That would explain everything.

45:19.080 --> 45:20.320
Tosh?

45:20.360 --> 45:21.800
NAOMI: <i> I know</i> <i>my own husband's voice.</i>

45:21.840 --> 45:23.800
He's on Newton's boat. He says he's been stabbed.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.280
NAOMI: <i> Sam and I left him</i> <i>to cool down and told him</i>

45:24.040 --> 45:27.280
<i>to meet us at the bar.</i>

45:27.320 --> 45:31.120
I know what I did that night, Inspector.

45:27.320 --> 45:31.120
I killed Tosh Walker.

45:31.160 --> 45:33.440
Well, I had to give him a drink

45:31.160 --> 45:33.440
to calm him down.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.080
No one's here.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.280
The question is, "Why?"

45:39.440 --> 45:42.480
I wasn't having an affair. But he had reason

45:39.440 --> 45:42.480
to think I was.

45:42.520 --> 45:45.240
Not if being good enough meant I had to be like him.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.360
The Santa Ana silver.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.120
The estimated value is about £300,000.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.240
But it can't be, can it?

45:54.880 --> 45:55.920
I need to find a doctor. Are you not feeling well?

45:57.720 --> 45:59.680
Yes, I'm fine. Sorry, not my doctor.

45:59.960 --> 46:02.280
Oh, um, also I need to gather the suspects together.

46:02.920 --> 46:03.960
But why?

46:04.400 --> 46:06.680
Because we've arrested the wrong person.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.160
Good evening.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.160
About an hour ago,

46:27.200 --> 46:29.320
we arrested Newton Farrell for the murder of Tosh Walker.

46:30.600 --> 46:34.440
Now the evidence against him was damning, to say the least.

46:34.920 --> 46:38.800
And his eventual confession gave us all we needed

46:34.920 --> 46:38.800
to charge him

46:38.840 --> 46:40.560
and make a successful conviction.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.680
So why are we all here?

46:43.600 --> 46:45.040
Well, because it turns out

46:45.080 --> 46:47.640
that Newton Farrell did not murder your husband.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.160
But you just said that he confessed to it.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.800
Why would he do that if he were innocent?

46:54.080 --> 46:55.840
Because he genuinely thought he had done it.

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
But I did.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.840
Er, no, Mr Farrell, you did not kill Tosh Walker.

47:00.160 --> 47:03.200
You did dispose of his body, but you didn't kill him.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.040
So who did it?

47:07.840 --> 47:10.280
It was his son. Wasn't it?

47:11.800 --> 47:12.960
Sam.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.280
You are joking, right?

47:16.320 --> 47:17.800
HUMPHREY: Oh, no. No joke.

47:18.360 --> 47:21.320
I am deadly serious when I say

47:18.360 --> 47:21.320
you killed your father.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.120
With a little bit of help from your stepmother.

47:26.760 --> 47:27.840
Yes, you.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.200
It was the two of you that came up

47:29.000 --> 47:31.200
with a plan together

47:32.040 --> 47:34.960
to murder Tosh and then frame Newton Farrell

47:35.000 --> 47:36.240
for the crime.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.480
How could we have killed Tosh?

47:38.760 --> 47:41.200
I spoke to him on the phone, just after he'd been stabbed.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.520
Ah, yes, good point. I'll come back to that.

47:43.960 --> 47:47.320
For now, let's start a little earlier

47:43.960 --> 47:47.320
in the evening.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.800
When Newton Farrell turned up at your boat

47:50.680 --> 47:52.080
and threatened Tosh.

47:52.560 --> 47:55.920
Something that had become a bit of a regular occurrence.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.600
It's not the first time it's happened.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.840
Tosh Walker! Show yourself.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.840
Newton Farrell. There's a surprise.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.480
Now you couldn't have predicted

48:05.520 --> 48:07.440
that it would play out quite the way it did

48:07.480 --> 48:09.800
with Newton punching Tosh.

48:10.760 --> 48:13.600
But you knew that tempers would flare between them.

48:14.480 --> 48:17.160
So then you took Mr Farrell back to his boat.

48:18.600 --> 48:22.080
<i>Where you proceeded</i> <i>to give him a healthy</i>

48:18.600 --> 48:22.080
<i>dose of rum.</i>

48:22.960 --> 48:27.360
<i>Because for your plan to work,</i> <i>you needed Newton asleep.</i>

48:28.440 --> 48:30.240
<i>Now not too hard to achieve.</i>

48:30.320 --> 48:33.240
<i>I mean, he was already</i> <i>half-cut, as he was</i>

48:30.320 --> 48:33.240
<i>most days at that time.</i>

48:33.280 --> 48:37.920
<i>So, a few more swigs of booze</i> <i>would just tip him</i>

48:33.280 --> 48:37.920
<i>over the edge.</i>

48:37.960 --> 48:39.520
<i>And once he was</i> <i>out for the count,</i>

48:39.560 --> 48:42.440
<i>I assume you went</i> <i>and found his diving knife.</i>

48:43.160 --> 48:44.800
<i>And then planted it somewhere</i>

48:44.840 --> 48:47.080
<i>you could easily recover it</i> <i>when you needed it later on.</i>

48:48.320 --> 48:51.320
That evening you were meant to be going out to celebrate.

48:52.080 --> 48:54.160
<i>But you knew</i> <i>Tosh wouldn't be in the mood,</i>

48:54.200 --> 48:56.560
<i>not after his run-in</i> <i>with Newton Farrell.</i>

48:58.080 --> 49:01.920
HUMPHREY: <i>And as you headed to the bar,</i>

48:58.080 --> 49:01.920
<i>leaving Tosh to stew,</i>

49:02.800 --> 49:05.680
<i>you knew it wouldn't be long</i> <i>before he paid Newton a visit.</i>

49:06.160 --> 49:09.160
Which is the last time we'd seen Tosh, so how could

49:06.160 --> 49:09.160
either of us have done it?

49:09.360 --> 49:12.760
'Cause it wasn't the last time Sam saw Tosh.

49:12.800 --> 49:13.960
Was it?

49:15.280 --> 49:16.720
<i>'Cause on his way to the bar,</i>

49:16.760 --> 49:19.440
<i>Sam took a little detour</i> <i>via Newton Farrell's boat.</i>

49:19.480 --> 49:21.600
<i>Didn't you, Sam?</i>

49:23.920 --> 49:28.760
<i>You followed your dad</i> <i>along the quayside</i>

49:23.920 --> 49:28.760
<i>and then on to Newton's boat.</i>

49:28.840 --> 49:31.840
<i>And once there,</i> <i>with Newton spark out,</i>

49:32.800 --> 49:36.840
<i>you took Newton's knife</i> <i>and you used it</i>

49:32.800 --> 49:36.840
<i>to kill your father.</i>

49:39.920 --> 49:42.040
FLORENCE: <i>When you had done that,</i>

49:42.080 --> 49:45.840
<i>it took but a matter of</i> <i>seconds for you to wipe</i>

49:42.080 --> 49:45.840
<i>the knife of your fingerprints</i>

49:45.880 --> 49:47.880
<i>and place it</i> <i>into Newton's hand.</i>

49:51.360 --> 49:53.360
<i>You then took Tosh's phone.</i>

49:53.400 --> 49:56.160
HUMPHREY: <i> Which would play</i> <i>a vital role in your plan</i>

49:53.400 --> 49:56.160
<i>a little later on.</i>

49:58.240 --> 50:00.520
FLORENCE: <i>And then you ran back</i>

49:58.240 --> 50:00.520
<i>to catch up with Naomi</i>

50:00.560 --> 50:02.880
<i>as she made her way</i> <i>to the harbour bar.</i>

50:03.560 --> 50:06.000
HUMPHREY: <i>And all you had to do then,</i>

50:06.480 --> 50:09.240
<i>was catch your breath</i> <i>and enter the bar together.</i>

50:09.920 --> 50:12.040
So as far as any onlookers were concerned,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.440
<i>you left the harbour together</i>

50:15.480 --> 50:17.120
<i>and you arrived</i> <i>at the bar together.</i>

50:17.480 --> 50:21.240
Which means that neither of you could have

50:17.480 --> 50:21.240
had time to kill Tosh.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.120
Then when the time was right, I assume, Sam,

50:27.240 --> 50:28.640
<i>you reached under the table,</i>

50:28.680 --> 50:30.920
<i>and dialled Naomi's mobile</i> <i>using Tosh's phone.</i>

50:31.400 --> 50:33.280
This is him now. Tosh?

50:33.480 --> 50:35.560
And Naomi, all you had to do then

50:35.600 --> 50:37.800
was pretend you were speaking to Tosh on the other end.

50:38.440 --> 50:39.880
Tosh?

50:39.920 --> 50:42.640
HUMPHREY: <i> And actually</i> <i>all there was was silence.</i>

50:42.680 --> 50:44.320
Tosh, where are you?

50:44.560 --> 50:48.000
You then left the bar to go and find Tosh's body

50:44.560 --> 50:48.000
at Newton's boat.

50:48.040 --> 50:51.240
Which is where things didn't play out

50:48.040 --> 50:51.240
quite as you'd intended.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.280
You see, your plan

50:53.480 --> 50:56.240
was to stumble upon the crime scene

50:53.480 --> 50:56.240
as you, Sam, had left it.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.800
Tosh's body lying on the floor

50:57.840 --> 50:59.320
and Newton asleep with a knife in his hand.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.640
An incriminating scene, to say the least.

51:02.040 --> 51:04.480
And with the phone call you'd just taken from Tosh,

51:04.880 --> 51:08.880
you both would have rock-solid alibis.

51:09.280 --> 51:11.080
But that's not what happened, is it?

51:12.240 --> 51:15.120
<i>Unfortunately, Newton woke up.</i>

51:15.520 --> 51:18.280
<i>And panicking,</i> <i>he disposed of the body.</i>

51:20.520 --> 51:23.800
So, by the time you arrived at his boat

51:20.520 --> 51:23.800
expecting to see Tosh dead

51:23.880 --> 51:25.680
<i>and Newton asleep</i> <i>with a knife in his hand,</i>

51:25.720 --> 51:27.480
<i>I imagine you must</i> <i>have been shocked</i>

51:27.520 --> 51:30.160
<i>by the fact that the boat</i> <i>was completely empty.</i>

51:30.200 --> 51:31.440
There's no one in here.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.720
Suddenly, not only did you both

51:31.760 --> 51:34.720
have perfect alibis,

51:34.760 --> 51:36.280
but now, so did Newton.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.840
Which has been sending us round the houses ever since.

51:40.040 --> 51:42.040
You see, Newton was the prime suspect.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.240
I mean, the evidence was stacked against him.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.160
It had to be him,

51:46.200 --> 51:50.240
but he was at Catherine's bar when Tosh was

51:46.200 --> 51:50.240
supposedly stabbed.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.320
Drink.

51:55.360 --> 51:59.680
Despite that one mistake, you still very nearly

51:55.360 --> 51:59.680
got away with it.

52:02.560 --> 52:04.320
You see, because Newton was so drunk that night,

52:04.360 --> 52:07.840
waking up to find Tosh's body on his floor

52:04.360 --> 52:07.840
and a knife in his hand,

52:07.880 --> 52:10.920
he came to believe that he genuinely

52:07.880 --> 52:10.920
committed the murder himself

52:10.960 --> 52:13.240
in some kind of a blacked out drunken state.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.880
Why would we kill him together?

52:15.920 --> 52:19.360
Yes, good question. And one that had me

52:15.920 --> 52:19.360
very much stumped.

52:19.480 --> 52:22.360
I mean, the murder could only have been committed

52:22.400 --> 52:24.200
if you two were working together.

52:24.240 --> 52:27.800
But why would a son contrive with his stepmum

52:28.360 --> 52:30.760
to kill his own dad? Doesn't make sense.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.840
And then it dawned on me.

52:34.360 --> 52:38.800
Everything you told us about the events that night

52:34.360 --> 52:38.800
had been a lie, Naomi.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.920
The phone call from Tosh, the walk to the bar,

52:41.960 --> 52:44.040
nothing you said was true.

52:44.720 --> 52:48.160
So what else had you told us that might not be true?

52:48.400 --> 52:52.080
Well, for example, the affair that Tosh was

52:48.400 --> 52:52.080
convinced you were having.

52:52.480 --> 52:54.680
I told you I was ill. I was getting treatment.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.640
That's why Tosh thought I was seeing someone else.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.320
That must have been tough,

52:58.360 --> 52:59.920
dealing with something like that on your own?

52:59.960 --> 53:01.680
Not being able to share it with someone, that's hard.

53:04.280 --> 53:06.520
So I phoned your doctor back in the UK.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.520
Are you saying I lied about it?

53:09.560 --> 53:11.040
No, not at all.

53:11.600 --> 53:14.920
I was just curious to know whether you were on your own

53:14.960 --> 53:16.440
when you were undergoing treatment.

53:17.160 --> 53:19.040
Or was there someone with you.

53:19.080 --> 53:22.600
Someone who was offering the support

53:19.080 --> 53:22.600
your husband couldn't.

53:22.640 --> 53:25.000
And your doctor said there was someone.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.760
A young man he assumed was your husband.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.200
Now as there's only one other Mr Walker...

53:32.040 --> 53:33.200
Sam.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.640
That was you, wasn't it?

53:39.000 --> 53:43.440
I mean, you've done a brilliant job hiding this

53:39.000 --> 53:43.440
from everyone here.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.920
But I think you two are in love.

53:48.560 --> 53:52.240
Sam, you said yourself you were nothing

53:48.560 --> 53:52.240
like your father.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.360
Not if being good enough meant I had to be like him.

53:55.720 --> 53:57.840
So when Naomi got ill a year ago,

53:57.880 --> 53:59.640
I imagine when she couldn't face

53:57.880 --> 53:59.640
telling Tosh...

53:59.680 --> 54:02.120
He wasn't very good at dealing with

53:59.680 --> 54:02.120
those kind of things.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.480
She found a replacement confidante in you.

54:04.760 --> 54:07.440
And that it seems, blossomed into

54:04.760 --> 54:07.440
something much more.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.040
You then realised that if this relationship

54:08.200 --> 54:11.040
was going to last,

54:11.120 --> 54:14.720
you had two choices. Option one.

54:15.160 --> 54:18.920
Reveal the truth to Tosh. How would that go down?

54:20.040 --> 54:23.560
Tosh finding out that his wife and his son

54:20.040 --> 54:23.560
have fallen in love?

54:24.640 --> 54:25.880
Not very well, I would imagine.

54:25.920 --> 54:29.240
He was an unforgiving and ruthless man.

54:29.720 --> 54:33.080
I mean, at the very least, he would have

54:29.720 --> 54:33.080
disinherited you.

54:34.040 --> 54:35.920
I mean, you'd lose everything.

54:36.640 --> 54:39.760
And maybe even that wouldn't be enough

54:36.640 --> 54:39.760
for a man like Tosh.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.720
Whereas, option two. If you kill Tosh,

54:43.160 --> 54:46.560
then he need never know what had gone on

54:43.160 --> 54:46.560
behind his back.

54:46.600 --> 54:49.200
And you walk away with the Santa Ana sliver,

54:46.600 --> 54:49.200
as well.

54:49.240 --> 54:52.440
Which is why the murder had to happen here

54:49.240 --> 54:52.440
on Saint Marie.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.360
Tosh, he was penniless.

54:54.600 --> 54:57.360
But you knew if you waited for him

54:54.600 --> 54:57.360
to find the lost silver,

54:58.240 --> 55:02.000
then you'd walk away with £300,000.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.960
Not a bad amount of money to make a fresh start with.

55:06.920 --> 55:08.480
It's a clever plan.

55:09.920 --> 55:11.040
Very clever.

55:12.400 --> 55:15.400
If it hadn't been for Newton here,

55:12.400 --> 55:15.400
waking up when he did.

55:17.880 --> 55:20.120
Dwayne, JP, do the business.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.400
Good evening, Inspector. And congratulations.

55:44.440 --> 55:46.640
Good evening, sir. And thank you.

55:46.680 --> 55:49.000
I wanted you to know that with Mrs Walker

55:49.040 --> 55:51.560
and Mr Walker Junior charged with murder,

55:51.600 --> 55:55.600
the Commission should be able to make a claim

55:51.600 --> 55:55.600
on the Santa Ana silver.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.840
All being well, it will stay where it belongs.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.640
Here, on the island.

56:00.680 --> 56:05.240
So, thank you. I'm extremely grateful.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.880
Anytime, Sir.

56:18.440 --> 56:21.880
Right, jolly good, here we go. There are bin bags,

56:22.280 --> 56:24.040
we have marigolds,

56:24.080 --> 56:26.720
and there are additional cleaning accoutrements

56:24.080 --> 56:26.720
in the kitchen,

56:26.760 --> 56:28.480
should you require them.

56:28.520 --> 56:32.720
But Chief, do you not think that

56:28.520 --> 56:32.720
as I organised the stag party,

56:32.760 --> 56:35.480
I should maybe be exempt from cleaning it up?

56:35.520 --> 56:39.680
With respect, Dwayne, I do not.

56:35.520 --> 56:39.680
Right, let's go to work!

56:42.280 --> 56:46.040
You know, sir, there is one thing

56:42.280 --> 56:46.040
I still want to know.

56:46.080 --> 56:47.960
-Go on. -OK.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.880
Well, what happened on your stag party

56:48.000 --> 56:51.880
that made it so unpleasant?

56:54.600 --> 56:56.360
OK. But not a word to the others, OK?

56:56.640 --> 56:58.560
-I promise. -OK.

56:59.280 --> 57:02.960
So, my stag night took place somewhere called Southend,

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
a little seaside town on the southeast coast

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
of England.

57:07.480 --> 57:09.200
Only that's not where I was when it happened.

57:09.640 --> 57:10.680
You weren't there?

57:12.960 --> 57:14.600
A place called Southport.

57:14.640 --> 57:17.240
A little seaside town in the northwest of England.

57:17.280 --> 57:20.920
See, I had misread the email. Ended up going to

57:17.280 --> 57:20.920
a different town.

57:21.680 --> 57:23.240
You missed your own stag night?

57:23.280 --> 57:25.920
-Yes, that's about the sum of it.

57:26.160 --> 57:28.640
Well, Florence, I don't know if you've

57:26.160 --> 57:28.640
tried to travel by train

57:28.680 --> 57:31.400
between Southport and Southend at 6pm on a Saturday evening,

57:31.720 --> 57:36.320
but it is a rather circuitous route.

57:31.720 --> 57:36.320
Four different trains.

57:36.360 --> 57:37.560
What time did you get there?

57:38.440 --> 57:42.160
Two in the morning. By which time everyone

57:38.440 --> 57:42.160
was drunk and in bed.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.000
Apparently, it was an amazing night.

57:44.040 --> 57:45.840
Best stag do ever, so I've heard.

57:46.720 --> 57:50.280
I think that might be the saddest story

57:46.720 --> 57:50.280
I've ever heard.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.280
And remember, Florence,

57:51.560 --> 57:54.400
what goes on the stag, stays on the stag.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.880
Don't worry, sir. Your secret is safe with me.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.120
MAN: Three, two, one!

58:12.600 --> 58:15.000
This time next week, we'll be back home.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.120
Be nice to be back.

58:20.720 --> 58:21.800
HUMPHREY: Oh! Oh, Humphrey?

58:22.960 --> 58:24.280
Yes.

58:24.320 --> 58:26.240
This is where they transferred you

58:26.520 --> 58:27.880
DWAYNE: Relax, JP.

58:27.920 --> 58:30.400
It's a whirlwind romance. These things happen.

58:31.240 --> 58:32.920
Do you think I'm getting married too soon?
