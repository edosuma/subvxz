WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.372
(Mindy)
OH, DANNY, I JUST REMEMBERED
THE DREAM I HAD LAST NIGHT.

00:04.405 --> 00:05.106
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.075
NO, YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE THIS ONE.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.242
SO I WAS IN THE JUNGLE,

00:08.276 --> 00:10.378
AND THIS GUY
WANTED ME SO BADLY.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.512
HE WAS, LIKE, TARZAN.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.780
WHY WOULD I
LIKE THIS DREAM?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.515
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT I'M
THINKING ABOUT IT,

00:14.548 --> 00:16.084
I THINK YOU MIGHT
NOT LIKE IT.
ALL RIGHT.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.351
IT'S ME!

00:17.385 --> 00:19.087
MA?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.521
DON'T GET UP.
IT'S ONLY YOUR MOTHER.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.522
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:21.555 --> 00:22.823
WELL, I WAS IN THE CITY,

00:22.856 --> 00:24.692
AND I THOUGHT I'D DROP OFF
SOME OLD MAGAZINES.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.194
OKAY, MA,
I TOLD YOU A HUNDRED TIMES,

00:26.227 --> 00:28.296
I DON'T WANT
YOUR OLD TV GUIDES.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.164
OH, ARE YOU
THE KING OF SIAM?

00:30.198 --> 00:31.765
YOU'RE TOO GOOD
FOR AN INSIDE LOOK

00:31.799 --> 00:33.301
AT THE FALL LINEUP?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.435
HELLO, MRS. CASTELLANO.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.370
SUCH AN HONOR TO MEET YOU.
I'M MINDY.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.708
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS HAS
BEEN A LOT OF FUN, MA, BUT--

00:40.741 --> 00:43.211
OH, OF COURSE.
IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:43.244 --> 00:46.214
WOULD YOU REMIND ME, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN WITH DANNY?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.216
COUPLE OF MONTHS,
ACTUALLY.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.450
OH, WELL,
I'M GLAD HE HAS YOU,

00:49.483 --> 00:52.220
BECAUSE HIS LAST GIRL,
SHE WASN'T VERY GOOD.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.321
OH, I KNOW.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.255
NO, SHE WAS LAZY

00:54.288 --> 00:56.257
AND ALWAYS LISTENING
TO THAT CUCARACHA MUSIC.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.258
UGH.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.360
YEAH.
WHICH GIRLFRIEND WAS THAT?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.429
WOULD YOU CONSIDER COMING OUT
TO STATEN ISLAND?

01:01.462 --> 01:04.365
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHE'S A BUSY GIRL, MA.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.533
THIS MINDY IS--

01:05.566 --> 01:06.867
WHAT? NO!
I WOULD LOVE TO.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.269
OH, COULD YOU
DO WEDNESDAYS?

01:08.302 --> 01:09.770
EVERY WEDNESDAY?

01:09.803 --> 01:11.105
SURE!
WHAT'S YOUR RATE, HON?

01:11.139 --> 01:12.373
MY RATE.
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.841
I THINK I'M AN EIGHT.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.776
YOU KNOW,
A TEN IN CHICAGO,

01:15.809 --> 01:17.178
BUT A FOUR
IN LOS ANGELES.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.246
OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.380
UH, MA, ENOUGH
WITH THE JIBBER-JAB.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.548
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.682
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

01:21.715 --> 01:24.552
THIS ONE HAS BEEN IN A HURRY
SINCE THE DAY HE WAS BORN.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.819
DON'T I KNOW IT.
YEAH.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.721
HE CAME OUT
TWO MONTHS EARLY,

01:27.755 --> 01:29.857
AND HE WAS ONLY
THREE INCHES TALL.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.292
YEAH, OKAY,
GOOD-BYE, MA.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.626
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
OKAY, BYE, DANNY.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.128
GOOD TO MEET YOU,
MRS. CASTELLANO.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.396
BYE-BYE.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.132
YOUR MOTHER LOVES ME.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.301
SHE THINKS YOU'RE
MY CLEANING LADY.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.773
[quirky upbeat music]

01:45.806 --> 01:53.814
*

01:57.318 --> 01:58.386
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL YOUR MOTHER

01:58.419 --> 01:59.453
THAT I WASN'T
THE CLEANING LADY?

01:59.487 --> 02:01.622
DO I LOOK DOMINICAN TO YOU?
DO NOT ANSWER THAT.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.324
I DIDN'T WANNA GET
INTO A WHOLE THING.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.694
I MEAN, I NEVER
MENTIONED YOU BEFORE.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.596
[gasps]
DON'T GASP.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.431
YOU'VE NEVER MENTIONED ME
TO YOUR MOTHER?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.333
DANNY, I HAVE TOLD
EVERYONE ABOUT US.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.402
I EVEN SHOWED MY WAXER
THAT BEAUTIFUL POEM YOU WROTE.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.537
BROWN ORCHID?
THAT WAS FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.372
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND IT WAS EROTIC.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.873
OKAY, LOOK, I WANTED TO.
I WANTED TO TELL HER.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.309
I WANTED TO SAY,
"MA, THIS IS MINDY,"

02:21.342 --> 02:23.677
BUT SHE'S--
SHE'S VERY DIFFICULT.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.213
ARE YOU INSANE?
I'M DIFFICULT.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.414
I MAKE YOU GET ME
A PRESENT EVERY DAY,

02:26.447 --> 02:27.515
OTHERWISE I FREAK OUT.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.782
YEAH, NO, I KNOW.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.917
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

02:29.950 --> 02:31.385
YOU'RE JUST GONNA KEEP US
APART FOREVER?

02:31.419 --> 02:32.420
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO
ON OUR WEDDING DAY?

02:32.453 --> 02:33.754
YOU'D BE FINE.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.223
YOU'D BE ALL COVERED UP
IN YOUR RELIGIOUS GARB.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.290
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN SEE YOU.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.525
WHAT RELIGION
DO YOU THINK I AM?

02:37.558 --> 02:39.193
ORTHODOX SOMETHING,
I DON'T KNOW.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.228
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE,
DANNY.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.230
OKAY, LOOK,
I GUESS I WAS HOPING

02:42.263 --> 02:45.266
THAT THINGS JUST
RESOLVED THEMSELVES

02:45.299 --> 02:47.268
BEFORE I HAD
TO INTRODUCE YOU.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.636
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

02:48.669 --> 02:49.937
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT, YOU KNOW,

02:49.970 --> 02:52.306
NATURAL FORCES WOULD JUST--

02:52.340 --> 02:54.275
JUST MAKE THINGS RESOLVED.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.343
WERE YOU TRYING
TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK

02:55.376 --> 02:56.610
UNTIL YOUR MOTHER DIED?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.279
LOOK, MY MOTHER WASN'T
LIKE OTHER MOTHERS.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.580
SHE'S TOUGH.
SHE HAD TO BE.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.549
SHE RAISED TWO BOYS
ALL BY HERSELF.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.951
SHE CLEANED HOTEL ROOMS
JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.486
WHAT IS "ENDS MEET"
ANYWAY?

03:05.519 --> 03:06.587
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT IT.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.456
IS THAT, LIKE, THE LAST,
FATTY PART OF THE RUMP ROAST?

03:08.489 --> 03:09.790
IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS.
I'D LOVE TO TRY IT.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.958
OKAY, LOOK,
THE POINT IS

03:10.991 --> 03:13.327
I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS
WOULD GET ALONG.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.995
SHE'S HATED ALL
MY EX-GIRLFRIENDS.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.930
YEAH, BUT, DANNY, I'M NOT LIKE
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIENDS, OKAY?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.732
MOMS LOVE ME.
YOU KNOW WHY?

03:18.766 --> 03:21.835
BECAUSE I HAVE A FOOLPROOF,
FOUR-POINT MOM-CATCHING PLAN

03:21.869 --> 03:24.004
THAT WORKS ON EVEN
THE PRICKLIEST OF MOMS.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.339
STEP ONE--

03:25.373 --> 03:27.275
OKAY.
OKAY, FINE, YOU CAN MEET HER.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.377
I JUST--I CAN'T LISTEN
TO ONE OF YOUR CUCKOO PLANS

03:29.410 --> 03:30.411
BEFORE 10:00 A.M.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.479
OH!

03:32.846 --> 03:35.349
[whistling]

03:35.383 --> 03:36.484
MORNING.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.952
HEY--WHAT ARE--
WHY IS THE DOOR OPEN?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.621
OKAY, RELAX,
I'M JUST PEEING.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.555
WHY ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.357
OH, TAMRA MAKES ME
SIT DOWN WHEN I PEE NOW,

03:43.391 --> 03:45.726
BECAUSE WHEN I STAND
I SPLASH EVERYWHERE.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.395
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, MAN.
NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.562
I MEAN, WHEN I'M DONE
IT LOOKS LIKE

03:48.596 --> 03:49.763
SINGIN' IN THE RAIN
IN THERE.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.565
LADIES, HUH?

03:51.599 --> 03:52.666
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO TO YOU.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.735
THEY RUIN YOUR LIFE.
THEY MAKE YOU WASH YOUR SHEETS.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.404
THEY KISS JEREMIES.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.506
OKAY, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
DR. REED KISSING YOUR GIRLFRIEND

03:58.539 --> 04:01.309
OR IS THIS DIRECTLY
APPLICABLE TO THIS SITUATION?

04:01.342 --> 04:02.510
OH, THE LATTER, DUDE.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.844
WHAT LADDER?

04:03.877 --> 04:06.314
LOOK, TAMRA HAS YOU WHIPPED
LIKE A FRAT PLEDGE,

04:06.347 --> 04:08.649
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
THEY SAY IS COOL,

04:08.682 --> 04:10.351
AND YOU THINK
THOSE GUYS ARE YOUR FRIENDS,

04:10.384 --> 04:12.353
AND THEN...
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.422
I'M NOT GONNA
SIT DOWN TO PEE.
DON'T.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.356
I'M GONNA STAND UP
WHEN I HAVE TO PEE,

04:15.389 --> 04:16.557
'CAUSE I'M A MAN.
YEAH.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.426
I'M NEVER SITTING
ON A TOILET EVER AGAIN.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.259
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.061
STARTING NOW.
MY LEGS ARE ASLEEP.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.062
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.397
HELP, SIR.
YEP. NO, NO, NO.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.333
DANNY, I AM SO HAPPY

04:25.366 --> 04:27.868
I FINALLY GET TO SEE
YOUR OFFICE.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.705
IT'S NICE, DANIEL.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.040
WELCOME TO
SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.543
I'M SURE YOUR SON'S
TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT ME.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.812
SHULMAN.
VERY NEW YORK-Y.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.881
AND, MA,
THIS IS MINDY.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.350
THAT'S THE WOMAN

04:42.383 --> 04:45.953
WHO...I'M--I'M--

04:45.986 --> 04:47.421
UH...

04:47.455 --> 04:48.789
YOU KNOW.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.360
YOU SEE, THESE DAYS--

04:52.393 --> 04:54.428
MINDY'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.829
YES. YEAH.
YEAH.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.665
MINDY.
THAT'S MINDY.

04:57.698 --> 05:01.435
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
YESTERDAY'S MISUNDERSTANDING.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.770
NO, IT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.104
ONE THANKSGIVING,
A LITTLE BOY THOUGHT I WAS

05:04.137 --> 05:05.973
THE DORA THE EXPLORER BALLOON.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.575
WELL, THIS IS GREAT, RIGHT?
THIS IS FUN.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.042
EVERYONE MET EACH OTHER.
THAT'S--THAT'S NICE.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.978
OKAY, TIME TO GO.
LET'S JUST--
ALL RIGHT.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.480
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
ON DOING IN THE CITY?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.548
I KNOW THIS GREAT
FROZEN YOGURT PLACE NEARBY.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.649
I MYSELF CAN'T GO.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.485
I'VE BEEN BANNED
FOR SAMPLE FRAUD.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.686
WELL, WE'RE GOING SHOPPING.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.354
RICHIE IS BUYING ME
A NEW OUTFIT

05:20.388 --> 05:21.855
FOR MY BIRTHDAY TOMORROW.

05:21.889 --> 05:25.125
YEAH, HE ALWAYS TAKES TIME OFF
FOR HIS MA.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.694
TO BE HONEST,
IT'S NOT TAKING TIME OFF

05:26.727 --> 05:27.961
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.697
HE'S GOT A JOB.
HE PLAYS TENNIS,

05:29.730 --> 05:33.000
AND HE MAKES THAT WEB SERIES
ABOUT HOW TO BE GAY ON A BUDGET.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.134
YEAH, YEAH, NO, NO.
I'M SORRY.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.403
NO, IT'S A GREAT SERIES.
I LOVED IT.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.537
I MEAN,
I LOVED THE FIRST ONE.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.705
THAT WAS, LIKE,
EIGHT MONTHS AGO,

05:37.738 --> 05:38.906
BUT IT WAS GREAT.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.141
HEY, LOOK.
HERE YOU GO, OKAY?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.143
TAKE THIS FOR MA'S OUTFIT.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.144
AND GET A HAIRCUT.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.046
YOU LOOK LIKE MOWGLI
FROM THE JUNGLE BOOK.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.147
WHAT'S THE JUNGLE BOOK?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.417
SO DO YOU HAVE BIG PLANS
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.151
OH, YEAH, WE'RE ALL GOING
TO BRUNCH TOMORROW.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.486
OH.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.854
IT'S NOT A BIG THING.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.389
YEAH, IT'S A BIG THING.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.825
MY BOYS WILL BE THERE,
AND MY BEST FRIEND, DOT.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.894
WE'RE GOING TO THIS PLACE
WHERE KELLY RIPA ALWAYS GOES.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.463
I MISS REGIS.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.532
I DO NOT LIKE
THE NEW GUY.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.800
YOU SHOULD COME, MINDY.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.437
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO COME.
THANK YOU.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.439
BUT THE RESERVATION'S
AT 1:00.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.506
1:00 P.M.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.107
AT THE SAME TIME THAT
MY C-SECTION IS SCHEDULED,

06:14.141 --> 06:15.142
WHICH I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.610
I FORGOT THAT
YOU TOLD ME THAT,

06:16.644 --> 06:17.711
BUT THERE'LL BE
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES

06:17.745 --> 06:18.779
TO GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.047
WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.450
I KNOW WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT SOMEDAY.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.817
ANYWAY, THIS WAS FUN.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.185
LET'S, UH--LET'S
JUST GO FOR A WALK.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.186
[whispering]
I'M SORRY.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.121
HMM.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.092
(Danny)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MA.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.594
BON APETIT.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.129
OH, MADONNA MIA,
I FORGOT MY CHEATERS.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.131
DANNY, COULD YOU READ ME
THE WHOLE MENU?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.000
I FORGOT MY HEARING AID,
SO MAKE IT LOUD.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.470
OKAY.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.671
APPETIZERS.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.738
DEVILED EGGS.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.173
TEN DOLLARS.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.641
MACARONI AND CHEESE BALLS--

06:47.675 --> 06:50.778
HELLO! GUESS WHO'S MAKING
A BRUNCH CAMEO.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.079
I GOT PETER TO COVER
MY C-SECTION

06:52.112 --> 06:54.081
SO I COULD JOIN YOU.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.117
OH, HOW NICE.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.986
HOW NICE.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.691
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:03.724 --> 07:05.559
DANNY, YOUR MOM INVITED ME.
I THOUGHT SHE WANTED ME TO COME.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.927
NO, NO!
SHE WAS JUST SAYING THAT.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.029
I TOLD YOU, SHE HATES ALL
MY GIRLFRIENDS; SHE HATES 'EM.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.931
OKAY, EVEN IF YOUR MOM
ISN'T CRAZY ABOUT ME,

07:10.964 --> 07:12.833
SHE WILL BE BY THE TIME
THIS BRUNCH IS OVER.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.802
DANNY, MY MOM-CATCHING PLAN
ALWAYS WORKS.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.003
LISTEN, IT'S NOT GONNA
WORK WITH MA, OKAY?

07:16.036 --> 07:16.904
SHE'S TRICKY.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.839
YOU GO IN THERE,
YOU'RE BEING NICE TO HER,

07:18.872 --> 07:20.941
YOU SAY ONE WRONG THING,
AND BLAMO--BLAMO!

07:20.974 --> 07:22.710
YOU'RE DEAD TO HER.
DANNY!

07:22.743 --> 07:23.777
WHOA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:23.811 --> 07:24.845
WHY ARE YOU RIPPING OFF
MY DRESS?

07:24.878 --> 07:25.779
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A LITTLE TRENCH.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.881
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
A DRESS.

07:27.915 --> 07:28.616
OKAY, I'M NERVOUS.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.652
OKAY, DON'T BE.
I GOT THIS.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.754
(Mindy)
STEP ONE,
COMPLIMENT HER.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.923
MRS. CASTELLANO,
I LOVE YOUR NEW BLAZER.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.859
THANK YOU. IT'S FROM
THE JANET RENO COLLECTION.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.861
(Mindy)
STEP TWO,
FIND COMMON GROUND.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.896
ALL YOU NEED IS ONE TV SHOW
THAT YOU BOTH WATCH.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.931
REAL HOUSEWIVES?
NO.

07:43.964 --> 07:44.932
BASKETBALL WIVES?
NO.

07:44.965 --> 07:45.933
ARMY WIVES.
NO.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.934
SISTER WIVES.
NOPE.

07:46.967 --> 07:47.935
WIFE SWAP?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.236
I ONLY WATCH CASTLE.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.904
EXCUSE ME.

07:50.938 --> 07:54.708
OH, HE WRITES MURDER MYSTERIES
AND HE SOLVES THEM?

07:54.742 --> 07:57.244
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
FOR A SHOW.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.212
YOU KNOW, MRS. CASTELLANO,
I LOVE HOW BECKETT

07:59.246 --> 08:01.549
IS ALWAYS GIVING CASTLE
A HARD TIME.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.716
ME TOO!

08:02.750 --> 08:03.851
CALL ME ANNETTE.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.818
OKAY.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.754
(Mindy)
STEP THREE,
COME BEARING GIFTS.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.189
AND DON'T FORGET
ABOUT MOM'S FRIEND.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.223
HUH?

08:10.257 --> 08:14.127
EEH!

08:14.161 --> 08:15.128
(Mindy)
STEP FOUR--

08:15.162 --> 08:17.297
AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
STEP OF ALL--

08:17.330 --> 08:18.866
AGREE WITH
EVERYTHING SHE SAYS.

08:18.899 --> 08:19.900
EVERYTHING.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.101
THIS RESTAURANT
IS FREEZING.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.836
I KNOW.
ANTARCTICA MUCH?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.272
I WOULDN'T MIND THEM IF THEY
DIDN'T HAVE SO MANY PARADES.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.541
I KNOW, I HATE
THAT ETHNIC GROUP TOO.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.943
ENOUGH WITH THIS MICHAEL
FASSBENDER AND HIS PENIS.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.079
I KNOW, PUT SOME CLOTHES ON,
YOU UGLY PERV.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.947
I THINK OUR WAITER
HAS AN ATTITUDE.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.183
UGH, YEAH, HE'S WORSE THAN
THE GUY THAT REPLACED REGIS.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.886
[laughs]

08:38.919 --> 08:40.954
I LIKE THIS ONE, DANNY.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.293
(Morgan)
DR. PRENTICE,
YOUR TAMRA ADVICE WORKED.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.761
SHE TOTALLY GETS IT.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.797
AND I'M NOW ALLOWED
TO PEE STANDING UP AGAIN.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.199
THERE IT IS.
CONGRATULATIONS, HUH?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.067
THANK YOU.
HAPPY BRO MITZVAH.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.869
MAZEL BROV.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.304
THANKS.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.307
HEY, SO DO YOU WANNA ADOPT
ALL MY DOGS?

09:00.340 --> 09:03.110
'CAUSE TAMRA JUST FOUND OUT
SHE'S ALLERGIC TO THEM,

09:03.143 --> 09:05.245
SO I HAVE TO GET RID
OF ALL OF THEM.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.215
HOLD ON.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.883
DUDE, YOU CAN'T GET RID
OF THESE DOGS.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.318
THEY'RE YOUR WHOLE IDENTITY.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.954
LOOK, IT'S NOT TAMRA'S FAULT
SHE'S ALLERGIC TO DOGS.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.322
CHIEF, SHE'S ALLERGIC
TO DOGS

09:15.355 --> 09:16.857
THE WAY I'M ALLERGIC
TO LATEX.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.692
SHE'S LYING
TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.861
YOU KNOW, ADULT-ONSET ALLERGY
IS A REAL THING.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.995
SHE ALSO RECENTLY FOUND OUT

09:22.029 --> 09:24.164
SHE'S ALLERGIC TO ALL METAL
THAT'S NOT GOLD.
MM-HMM.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.799
AND SHE'S ALLERGIC
TO ALL SEAFOOD

09:25.833 --> 09:27.635
THAT'S NOT
VERY EXPENSIVE LOBSTER.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.869
SHE'S A WOMAN.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.738
ALL WOMEN HAVE THICKER
FOLDS IN THEIR BRAINS,

09:30.771 --> 09:32.940
MAKING THEM MORE
MANIPULATIVE BY NATURE.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.708
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MEDICAL JOURNAL

09:34.742 --> 09:35.809
YOU'RE READING THAT FROM.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.377
IS YOUR DOG'S FUR SILKY?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.313
COULD IT BE MISTAKEN
FOR LONG-HAIRED MINK?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.949
YEAH, IT COULD.
YOU COULD BRUSH IT OUT.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.116
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:43.150 --> 09:44.184
NO, I DON'T THINK
ANY OF THEM COULD.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.953
THANKS THOUGH.
ACTUALLY,
A COUPLE OF THEM COULD.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.921
THE GUY ON THE LEFT.
EH...

09:47.955 --> 09:49.990
I-I GOTTA
BE HONEST WITH YOU,

09:50.023 --> 09:51.892
IT COULD
VERY EASILY THOUGH.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.961
SHE'S GONNA KILL THOSE DOGS
AND MAKE 'EM INTO A JACKET.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.262
BEVERLY!

09:56.429 --> 09:59.399
[cheers and applause]
YOU GOT 'EM ALL.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.001
ANNETTE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU COULD HAVE WISHED FOR.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.903
YOU ALREADY HAVE THE GREATEST
SONS IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.772
THAT'S VERY SWEET, DEAR.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.406
BUT I WISHED
THAT THE MEAN WAITRESS

10:06.439 --> 10:08.208
AT OUR FAVORITE DINER
WOULD DIE.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.944
WELL, I CAN'T KILL HELEN
FOR YOU, MA,

10:10.978 --> 10:13.146
BUT I DID GET YOU A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.682
OH, THANK YOU.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.250
IT'S A NEW STOVE.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.952
BRUSHED CHROME,

10:18.986 --> 10:20.120
DIGITAL READ-OUT,
STATE-OF-THE-ART.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.955
I HAD IT INSTALLED TODAY, MA.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.658
NO.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.727
NO, DANNY,
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.961
YOU GOTTA RETURN THIS.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.263
I'D FEEL GUILTY
COOKING ON THIS.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.800
WHAT, WITH JESUS LOOKING
DOWN AT ME FROM THE CRUCIFIX

10:32.833 --> 10:34.034
ABOVE THE MICROWAVE.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.068
I COULDN'T.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.004
YOUR OLD STOVE
WAS LEAKING GAS, MA.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.271
THE BIRD DIED.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.107
THE GAS HELPED ME SLEEP.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.842
BUT THE GUY
INSTALLED IT TODAY.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.144
THE GUY?
WHO'S THIS GUY?

10:44.177 --> 10:46.680
JUST A--
NOW HE KNOWS
THE LAYOUT OF YOUR HOUSE.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.917
THAT IS HOW
ELDER RAPE OCCURS.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.284
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU, DANNY.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.986
THIS IS A VERY NICE GIFT.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.321
YOU'RE WELCOME, MA.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.889
HEY, MA, I GOT YOU
SOMETHING TOO.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.126
OH.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.160
[gasps]

11:00.193 --> 11:02.763
OH!
OH, RICHIE!

11:02.796 --> 11:04.932
I LOVE BEARS!

11:04.965 --> 11:06.800
YOU GOT THIS YOURSELF?

11:06.834 --> 11:07.835
AT THE AIRPORT.

11:07.868 --> 11:08.902
I GOT YOU
A SNOW GLOBE TOO,

11:08.936 --> 11:09.903
BUT I KEPT IT.

11:09.937 --> 11:10.904
YOU OKAY WITH THE BEAR?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.840
THIS IS PERFECT!

11:12.873 --> 11:14.908
AND FROM HUDSON NEWS.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.376
LA-DI-DA.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.912
AND AT LEAST THE BEAR DOESN'T
KNOW THE LAYOUT OF YOUR HOUSE.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.949
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF SOMEONE
KNOWS THE LAYOUT OF YOUR...

11:21.982 --> 11:23.951
HOUSE.
YEAH, SORRY.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.819
DOT, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.121
I THINK IT'D BE UNSAFE TO KNOW
THE LAYOUT OF SOMEONE'S HOUSE.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.256
I'M SO SORRY, MA.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.792
LOOK, DANNY,
I LOVE YOUR GIFT TOO.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.326
IT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.128
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.
SURE, SURE.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.429
WAY TOO MUCH.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.465
LIKE, IT MADE
EVERYTHING AWKWARD.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.869
(Mindy)
STEP FOUR, AGREE WITH
EVERYTHING SHE SAYS.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.403
EVERYTHING.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.838
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.942
NO, I-I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS AN AMAZING GIFT.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.211
AND IF DANNY WAS MY SON,
I WOULD BE SO PROUD.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.313
HE PLANNED
THIS INCREDIBLE BRUNCH,

11:53.346 --> 11:54.915
AND HE DOES SO MANY
OTHER THINGS FOR YOU.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.116
AND HE'S ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.888
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"SO MANY OTHER THINGS"?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.856
OH, BOY.
NOTHING.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.525
SO DANNY TOLD YOU
HE PAYS ALL MY BILLS?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.894
NO.
NO, NO.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.962
DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT
MY QVC DOLLS?

12:08.996 --> 12:12.933
THE THOUSANDS I SPEND ON
MY PHONE GAME, COFFEE CRUNCH?

12:12.966 --> 12:15.102
WELL, I AM SORRY!

12:15.135 --> 12:17.805
I TOLD YOU I HAD TO KEEP
BUYING COFFEE HAMMERS

12:17.838 --> 12:19.940
SO I COULD BEAT LEVEL 44,
I TOLD YOU THAT!

12:19.973 --> 12:21.775
IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE LEVEL.

12:21.809 --> 12:22.843
OF COURSE IT IS.
MA--

12:22.876 --> 12:23.844
MA, PLEASE, CALM DOWN.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.979
MINDY DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT.
NOTHING.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.281
I'M SORRY WE'RE SUCH
A BURDEN TO YOU, DANNY,

12:28.315 --> 12:30.918
AND THAT YOU FELT IT
NECESSARY TO BROADCAST

12:30.951 --> 12:35.122
OUR PRIVATE FAMILY BUSINESS
TO HER.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.824
I DO NOT LIKE YOU.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.926
MA, THAT'S NOT--

12:38.959 --> 12:40.427
MA!

12:40.460 --> 12:42.195
I THINK--
I THINK IT WAS--

12:42.229 --> 12:44.497
I THINK IT WAS, LIKE,
AN A-MINUS.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.402
OH, MA.
OKAY, THAT'S A BIT MUCH.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.838
CAN YOU JUST PLEASE
CALL YOUR MOTHER.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.105
OKAY, SHE'S PROBABLY
OVER IT BY NOW.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.506
NO, ITALIAN PEOPLE
DON'T GET OVER THINGS.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.208
THEY LET THEIR ANGER
FESTER AND FERMENT,

12:55.242 --> 12:57.010
GROWING STRONGER OVER TIME.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.345
THAT'S WHY OUR WINE'S
SO GOOD.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.646
WELL, I'M SORRY, DANNY.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.982
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER FORCED YOU
TO INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR MOTHER.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.451
GOD, SO THIS IS WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE TO BE WRONG.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.452
I DON'T LIKE IT.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.319
IT WAS A VALIANT EFFORT,

13:06.353 --> 13:09.356
BUT MA AND GIRLFRIENDS,
THEY DON'T MIX.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.323
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T WANNA BE

13:10.357 --> 13:12.059
JUST ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR GIRLFRIENDS, DANNY.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.293
I WANTED TO BE DIFFERENT.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.294
YOU ARE DIFFERENT.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.228
YOU'RE VERY DIFFERENT.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.430
MY OLD GIRLFRIENDS,
THEY LOVED TO WORK OUT.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.566
AND THEY NEVER STOLE CHANGE
FROM MY COIN JAR.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.268
EH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:21.301 --> 13:25.405
I THINK THE WHOLE THING
WILL BLOW OVER IN ABOUT...

13:25.438 --> 13:29.076
FIVE OR TEN YEARS.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.511
[sighs]

13:35.115 --> 13:36.383
[phone line rings]

13:36.416 --> 13:37.684
ANNETTE CAN'T
COME TO THE PHONE

13:37.717 --> 13:40.353
BECAUSE I'VE GONE BACK TO WORK
CLEANING HOTEL ROOMS

13:40.387 --> 13:42.389
SO AS NOT TO BURDEN MY SON.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.391
[beep]

13:45.658 --> 13:47.294
BEVERLY,
I'M GOING TO STATEN ISLAND.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.295
CANCEL MY 1:00.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.529
SCHEDULING'S NOT MY JOB.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.465
I'M IN CHARGE OF PENCILS.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.304
THIS CAKE IS TERRIBLE.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.405
IT'S A DOG TREAT.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.473
I KNOW!

14:00.507 --> 14:03.610
JUST I'M NOT SURE SHE'S READY
TO BE A DOG OWNER.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.078
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD YOU DO

14:05.112 --> 14:07.547
TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE GOT
THE PROPER EXERCISE?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.216
TAKE IT ON LITTLE WALKS.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.617
OH, DAMN IT, SHE'S RIGHT.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.452
SOPHIE'S BEEN WANTING
A DOG FOR A LONG TIME.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.421
EVER SINCE HER MOTHER LEFT,
ACTUALLY.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.555
WELL, THEN YOU,
MORE THAN ANYONE,

14:15.588 --> 14:18.058
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE
OF KEEPING A FAMILY TOGETHER.

14:18.091 --> 14:21.128
AND I CAN ASSUME THAT
YOU'LL TAKE ALL 40 DOGS.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.462
UH, NO.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.497
OKAY.
HEY, BABY!

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
HEY, BABY.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.461
YOU WANTED DANIEL
TO FEEL GUILTY.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.263
BUT GUESS WHAT, HE FEELS
GUILTY ENOUGH AS IT IS.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.730
EVERY TIME WE TAKE
A SHOWER TOGETHER,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.299
HE MAKES A DONATION
TO THE VATICAN.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.333
UGH!

16:40.367 --> 16:41.468
HEY, YOU ARE NOT
DOING THIS ANYMORE.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.218
YOU KNOW, YOUR SON

16:58.251 --> 16:59.819
IS A REALLY GREAT GUY.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.421
EVERY NIGHT WHEN
I FALL ASLEEP ON THE SOFA,

17:01.454 --> 17:02.822
HE CARRIES ME TO BED.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.558
WELL, HE TRIES TO, AND THEN
HE JUST DRAGS ME BY THE LEG.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.360
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
MY SON IS GREAT?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.130
OF COURSE I DO.
HE'S MY SON.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.598
THEN WHY ARE YOU SO HARD
ON HIM ALL THE TIME?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.266
YOU KNOW, MY PARENTS
SEND ME AN EMAIL EVERY DAY,

17:13.300 --> 17:16.136
AND THE SUBJECT HEADING IS,
"MINDY'S COMPLIMENT CORNER."

17:16.169 --> 17:17.804
WELL, NOW THAT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF PROBLEM.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.841
LOOK, I TREAT DANIEL
THE WAY I DO

17:21.874 --> 17:24.811
BECAUSE HE CAN HANDLE IT.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.346
HE'S TOUGH.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.082
HE DOESN'T NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.784
WELL, I THINK EVERYONE NEEDS
TO GET TAKEN CARE OF SOMETIME,

17:31.818 --> 17:33.186
EVEN DANNY.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.156
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE LIKES YOU SO MUCH.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.626
HE FINALLY FOUND
A STRONG IMMIGRANT WOMAN

17:39.659 --> 17:41.561
TOUGH ENOUGH
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.563
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD
DESCRIBE MYSELF THAT WAY.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.832

17:59.579 --> 18:01.148
WE CAN SPLIT THE TIP.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.216
I'M KEEPING
THE ENTIRE TIP.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.688
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
BACKWARDS-ASS ISSUES WITH WOMEN

18:08.721 --> 18:11.424
DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO BURN DOWN OUR PARADISE.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.392
