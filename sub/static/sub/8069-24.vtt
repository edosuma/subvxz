[theme music playing]

00:56.157 --> 00:59.360
Someone's got a
special day coming up.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.261
Oh?

01:00.294 --> 01:01.629
Mm, hmm.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.864
And I know who.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.100
Give me a break, Crystal.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.336
Roseanne, is it your birthday?

01:08.369 --> 01:10.604
Saturday.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.605
Congratulations.

01:11.639 --> 01:12.806
Thank you.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.775
Happy birthday, Roseanne.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.410
How old are you going to be?

01:16.444 --> 01:17.845
Well, uh--

01:17.878 --> 01:18.679
37.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.718
Do you have anything
special planned?

01:24.752 --> 01:25.619
I don't know.

01:25.653 --> 01:26.454
Crystal?

01:29.490 --> 01:34.862
Listen, as my present, I'm
going to give you Saturday off.

01:34.895 --> 01:35.763
No.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.031
I insist.

01:38.065 --> 01:41.435
Here you go.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.470
Make a wish.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.404
Happy birthday, Roseanne.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.706
Happy birthday.

01:45.739 --> 01:49.943
OK, I wish that
even though you're

01:49.977 --> 01:53.447
giving me Saturday off that I
would still get paid for it.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.221
Of course, you will.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.026
What did you wish, Roseanne?

02:06.059 --> 02:06.894
Don't tell her, Roseanne.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.062
It's bad luck.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.531
It's bad luck not to tell.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.934
Maybe you won't get
paid for that day off.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.836
[laughs]

02:16.837 --> 02:21.475
Well, I wished for time.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.843
Time for what?

02:22.876 --> 02:26.380
I used to do all this writing,
you know, when I was younger.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.416
Roseanne is a terrific writer.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.518
Oh, what do you
write, Roxanne?

02:30.551 --> 02:32.920
Nothing now, but
I used to, you know,

02:32.953 --> 02:35.589
write a lot when I
was, you know, younger.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.824
Like what?

02:36.857 --> 02:39.260
Like these poems and
stories and junk like that.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.229
Whatever my brain churned out.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.832
You know, my nephew
Roger does calligraphy.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.105
So how come you
stopped writing?

02:52.139 --> 02:53.241
You know, I don't know.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.142
I was-- I was writing
this one day, you know,

02:55.175 --> 02:58.279
and a grenade went
off in my hand.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.080
Oh, I hate when that happens.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.385
How come you did stop?

03:04.418 --> 03:07.288
Well, because, you know,
work and Dan and the kids.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.622
I don't have any time.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.559
What if you did a little
writing before you go to sleep?

03:11.592 --> 03:15.729
No, I like to do something
else before I go to sleep.

03:15.763 --> 03:19.500
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.835
Surely, not every
night, Roxanne.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.405
Oh, yeah, that's what
us poor people do we.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.106
We don't have VCRs.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.009
[music playing]

03:38.986 --> 03:41.422
OK, who are these guys?

03:41.455 --> 03:42.823
Splitting Headaches.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.029
And what's the
name of the song?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.332
Pounding.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.966
So basically we're
listening to Pounding

03:53.000 --> 03:54.302
by the Splitting Headaches.

03:57.405 --> 04:00.474
Oh, oh, my god, here it is.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.414
Dan!

04:09.450 --> 04:10.418
Dan!

04:10.451 --> 04:11.419
Dan!

04:11.452 --> 04:12.886
Hey, Dan, come here.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.355
Look what I found.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.858
Coming, mother.

04:17.891 --> 04:21.629
Oh, my god you found a
dusty book in the basement.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.532
No, it's not
just a dusty book.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.733
It's my old journal.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.168
I started writing it in '65.

04:28.201 --> 04:31.505
Oh wow, time warp.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.807
Look it here, I get
a whole page about Gary

04:33.841 --> 04:36.310
Pucket and the Union Gap.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.811
Hey, you can't see it.

04:37.845 --> 04:38.812
It's private.

04:38.846 --> 04:43.283
Listen to this-- turn that down.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.885
Hey, hey, hey, air raid.

04:44.918 --> 04:45.786
End of war.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.854
That's what you think.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.557
I've got troops coming
in from the north.

04:49.590 --> 04:56.964
That may be, but by the
year 1983, when I turned 30,

04:56.997 --> 04:59.600
I vow to accomplish
the following.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.102
Fall in love with a
warm, sexy, loving man

05:02.135 --> 05:03.203
who doesn't care about money.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.575
But has a ton of it.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.546
Well, I was only 17.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.781
Well, so continue.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.584
OK, and two, I will
live on 100-year-old

05:16.617 --> 05:21.955
farm with a private secretary,
cook, and also maybe a farmer.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.057
You wanted to be a farmer?

05:24.091 --> 05:27.561
Well, I wanted to live
on a farm and own a farm

05:27.595 --> 05:30.097
and look at a farm, but not
do any of the actual touching

05:30.130 --> 05:30.931
of animals.

05:33.734 --> 05:37.405
And three, I will
be a famous writer.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.040
You wanted to be a writer?

05:40.073 --> 05:41.909
Yeah.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.711
Yeah, I did.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.446
Hey, hey, what's the matter?

05:45.479 --> 05:46.346
Nothing.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.416
Come on, Roseanne.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.283
Two minutes ago you were
cleaning out the basement,

05:50.317 --> 05:51.251
having the time of your life.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.621
Now, you're all bummed out.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.589
I used to write, Dan.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.090
I used to write every day.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.291
Yeah, I remember.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.560
I mean this book has me.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.328
My soul is in there.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.164
I used to write down everything
I was ever thinking about.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.065
So now you found it.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.299
You could write in it some more.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.367
When?

06:07.401 --> 06:09.770
I mean, I got a job,
three kids, and you.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.276
We're not going
to live forever.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.012
I don't know, writing was
just something that really gave

06:19.046 --> 06:20.380
me a lot of pleasure, you know.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.382
Then I just gave it up.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.619
You give all your time to
your family and your job.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.787
You got a life.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.688
I got lazy.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.589
You got lazy.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.657
ROSEANNE: No, I didn't get lazy.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.691
Did get lazy.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.959
OK, I did get lazy.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.360
OK, don't patronize me.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.829
I am patronizing you
because every time you clean

06:35.863 --> 06:37.465
out a closet, I pay the price.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.766
What are you talking about?

06:38.799 --> 06:41.301
This cleaning jag you're on.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.505
I've got an even number of
socks in my sock drawer,

06:44.538 --> 06:49.409
all folded the same way in
little stacks arranged by hue.

06:49.443 --> 06:54.748
So sue me for trying to put
some order into your drawers.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.584
This is a birthday
thing, isn't it?

06:56.617 --> 06:57.417
- No.
- Roseanne.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.285
This isn't a birthday thing.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.419
Dan.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.388
So how are you going
to be this year, Mom?

07:01.421 --> 07:02.656
40.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.492
What are you talking about?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.226
You're not turning 40.

07:06.259 --> 07:10.998
Well maybe not this
year, but in a few years.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.634
40 years old.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.302
Wow.

07:15.335 --> 07:16.537
So like you were
alive in the '50s.

07:19.540 --> 07:23.243
That's five times
older than DJ.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.579
I could have lived
my life three times

07:25.613 --> 07:27.214
and not be as old as you.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.817
[giggles]

07:29.850 --> 07:32.219
Would you like to get started
on your second life right now?

07:38.492 --> 07:40.628
Hey, if you're making
out of shopping list,

07:40.661 --> 07:44.397
I need some razors, the
kind with the comfort strip.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.899
It's not a grocery list, Dan.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.100
I'm trying to write.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.001
Oh, yeah?

07:48.035 --> 07:50.938
Yeah?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.373
That's great.

07:53.406 --> 07:54.675
What time do you
get up this morning.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.782
It's 5:30 AM.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.617
The house is still
and quiet except

08:03.651 --> 08:06.353
for an intermittent
rumble from the bedroom,

08:06.386 --> 08:10.090
the snore of my life mate.

08:10.123 --> 08:13.160
I don't snore.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.630
No, Dan, this is fiction.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.031
Well, I'm really
proud of you, babe.

08:18.065 --> 08:18.866
You're really doing it--

08:25.606 --> 08:28.441
[ruffling of paper]

08:32.980 --> 08:34.915
Sorry

08:34.948 --> 08:35.816
That's OK.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.117
I'll just go in the living room.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.130
No, DJ, go eat breakfast
before you start watching TV.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.265
I want to eat in here.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.267
Hey, DJ, your mom's
trying to write.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.136
Go get your cereal
and we'll it in here.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.705
Honey, you can have
the kitchen back.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.606
Oh, great.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.912
Morning, Dad.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.814
Hey, Beck, be real quiet
going into the kitchen.

09:06.847 --> 09:07.715
You're mom's trying to write.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.821
Good morning, everyone.

09:13.854 --> 09:17.024
- Shh, mom's trying to write.
- Write what?

09:17.057 --> 09:17.858
Darlene.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.897
(WHISPERING) Have you
seen my history book?

09:23.931 --> 09:25.065
Well, did you
check in the washer?

09:25.098 --> 09:26.767
Of course, I
checked in the washer.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.669
How about under the sofa?

09:28.702 --> 09:29.770
Yes, I checked under the sofa.

09:29.803 --> 09:30.771
Well, did you look upstairs?

09:30.804 --> 09:31.972
Yes.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.174
Well, how come you're
always losing your stuff?

09:34.207 --> 09:36.376
Well, answer her.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.713
[music playing]

09:43.216 --> 09:45.452
ROSEANNE: Well,
this better be good.

09:45.485 --> 09:46.687
I'm sure excited.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.724
I have here one silk scarf
made of genuine Dacron.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.529
You guys know how I hate
surprises, especially when

09:56.563 --> 09:57.665
I don't know what they are.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.232
You're doing to like this one.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.102
One, two, three, four.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.873
(SINGING) They say
it's your birthday.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.141
It's my birthday too.

10:08.175 --> 10:12.612
ROSEANNE: Oh, you got
the Beetles to come over.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.214
BECKY: There's a
step right there.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.115
Step.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.116
Be careful.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.218
There's a step right there.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.052
Step.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.791
All right.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.960
(ALL) Happy birthday.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.796
Um-- my own door.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.999
Open it.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.868
OK.

10:34.902 --> 10:38.571
Uh-- my own dungeon.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.472
It's an office.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.708
So you can write.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.409
Oh, my won office.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.410
Do you like it?

10:43.443 --> 10:44.611
It's my own office.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.447
It's just so you don't
bother us when you write.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.816
Oh, it's just great.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.583
It's fantastic.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.886
Yeah, I put all these shelves
in here for all your all,

10:52.920 --> 10:53.921
you know, the stuff you write--

10:53.954 --> 10:54.822
Manuscripts.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.156
Manuscripts.

10:56.189 --> 11:00.861
Now, how did you do this
without me even knowing?

11:00.894 --> 11:03.864
Thank you.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.365
Happy birthday, Mom.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.834
Here, pencils.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.335
Oh

11:08.368 --> 11:10.103
Yeah, and I go
you some notepads.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.472
And I got a dictionary
and a thesaurus.

11:12.505 --> 11:17.377
Ah, gee, this is like the
Partridge family or something.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.580
And for the grand finale,
I'm taking the kids to the mall

11:20.613 --> 11:22.015
for lunch and a movie.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.817
And we got the afternoon
to yourself to write.

11:23.851 --> 11:24.885
What?
You're all leaving?

11:24.918 --> 11:25.786
Gone.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.154
We'll miss you.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.155
I'll miss you, too.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.257
Now scram.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.025
You know, Stephen
King started this way.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.374
(SINGING) I'm 37.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.542
I'm not really 40.

11:54.514 --> 12:00.620
And I'm spending the afternoon
all alone in my basement.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.523
[music playing]

12:47.367 --> 12:48.836
JACKIE: Roseanne, you out here?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.337
Hey, come to the window.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.139
I'm in the basement.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.040
Hi.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.842
What are you doing down there?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.309
You know, today's your birthday.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.210
You're 37.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.411
I know.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.312
Happy Happy birthday.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.647
Hey, look it.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.184
Dan made me an office
so as I can write.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.385
Looks great.

13:05.418 --> 13:09.222
Maybe I should bring you
a cake with a file in it.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.357
No, it's great.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.093
Look, I got a desk and
shelves and everything.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.329
And on top of that, he ups
and takes the kids to the mall

13:16.363 --> 13:17.931
so as, you know,
I can concentrate.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.299
How's it going?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.733
You getting anything done?

13:20.767 --> 13:22.769
No, I'm going nuts.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.005
Well I don't want to
break your concentration.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.606
I just came by to wish
you a happy birthday.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.776
So I'll stop by later and
I can give you my present.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.080
Well, why can't I open it now?

13:33.113 --> 13:34.514
I haven't bought it yet.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.317
[music playing]

13:40.287 --> 13:42.822
Are you in need
of some stroking?

13:42.856 --> 13:48.028
No, I'm-- just in need of, you
know, something to write about.

13:48.061 --> 13:52.565
I mean, I got like a dozen
sharpen Dixon Ticonderoga

13:52.599 --> 13:54.734
number twos and no ideas.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.337
Well, what did you
used to write about?

13:57.370 --> 13:58.571
My life and stuff.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.607
But I think it was just
more interesting back then.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.375
No.
Cut it out.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.376
I don't know.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.712
I-- I think I shouldn't
start big maybe.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.380
Shouldn't start so
big like by writing.

14:07.414 --> 14:11.184
I should start maybe
smaller by plagiarizing.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.254
You know, Roseanne, I've
learned a lot about writing

14:14.287 --> 14:16.589
from the police reports.

14:16.623 --> 14:20.727
JACKIE: They've got
to be convincing.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.964
They've got to be accurate.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.034
They've got to be
at least two pages

14:27.067 --> 14:31.304
long or else Judge Samuels isn't
going to take them seriously.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.309
JACKIE: So what I've found
is the best way to start out

14:36.343 --> 14:39.846
is by the facts.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.747
What facts?

14:40.780 --> 14:42.282
Fac-- uh--

14:42.315 --> 14:46.286
well, what are the facts
in "Gone with the Wind"?

14:46.319 --> 14:49.889
Well, I think we're talking
about literature here,

14:49.923 --> 14:52.459
and not the movies.
- It was a book.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.167
"Gone with the
Wind" was a book?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.139
So you look at the facts.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.207
What are the facts?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.875
You got the North,
the South, the troops,

15:08.908 --> 15:11.945
the horses, the staircase,
the birthing babies,

15:11.979 --> 15:14.447
and a big fire.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.348
You're kidding me.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.249
It was a book?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.085
Yeah.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.221
Everything's got facts
and events and people

15:21.254 --> 15:23.023
in the events.

15:23.056 --> 15:26.459
And so you take the
people in the events

15:26.493 --> 15:31.031
and then you put them in the
order that the facts happen.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.666
And then you're done.

15:33.700 --> 15:38.571
Well, I'll be damned if "Gone
with the Wind" wasn't a book.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.008
[music playing]

15:42.609 --> 15:45.412
So how'd you like
your dinner, Mom?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.180
Oh it was really great.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.050
And I'll like it even more
when it's all cleaned up.

15:50.083 --> 15:50.984
Come on, Darlene.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.585
You got to help.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.953
Why do I have to help?

15:53.987 --> 15:55.989
Darlene, get to work.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.890
So when do we get to
see what you wrote today?

15:57.924 --> 16:02.629
Ah, as soon as
the movie comes out.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.764
No we want to read it.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.400
Well, you can't read
it a piece at that time.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.370
You got to wait till the
whole book is finished.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.672
You writing the
great American novel?

16:12.705 --> 16:15.408
Well you know, that's
always been my dream.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.077
And with that new office--

16:17.110 --> 16:18.411
You like that office?

16:18.445 --> 16:20.380
That is a perfect office.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.315
So everything's
working out OK.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.216
You've got the time.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.618
You've got the place.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.655
Not a bad birthday present, huh?

16:28.688 --> 16:32.559
Good hubby, good hubby.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.862
I'll tell you, It's such
a great office sometimes

16:35.895 --> 16:37.030
I can't tell you
how many times I'm

16:37.064 --> 16:38.998
sitting down there
and just looking

16:39.032 --> 16:42.735
at those walls in wonderment.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.071
As long as you're
getting to write.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.073
You should have seen
her down there today.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.874
The pages are just pouring out.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.115
So what are going
title of your book?

16:55.148 --> 16:59.386
101 things to do
with the kids' heads.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.354
You know, writing isn't easy.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.422
That's a true.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.524
Specially them h's.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.060
Maybe you should stop
using your head as an eraser.

17:07.094 --> 17:11.498
You should start using
Darlene's head as an eraser.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.133
So weak.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.033
Very weak.

17:14.067 --> 17:14.867
Yeah.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.371
David, you got to help.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.272
Make me.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.141
[screams]

17:23.076 --> 17:26.713
So, when do I get to
read this masterpiece?

17:26.746 --> 17:28.581
As soon as I write something.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.617
I thought so.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.652
Yeah, but you should see
what I done to them shelves

17:32.685 --> 17:34.454
down there.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.555
What's the matter, baby?

17:35.588 --> 17:36.556
You didn't write anything?

17:36.589 --> 17:38.225
It's not the office, is it?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.026
Oh, no, honey, no,
it isn't the office.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.528
It's me.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.597
I get some good idea, but
as soon as I write it down,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.133
it turns out stupid.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.302
Roseanne, don't start
getting all down on yourself.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.503
Yeah, you know,
pitchers don't go

17:50.537 --> 17:51.704
down to Florida
[kids yelling] in February

17:51.738 --> 17:52.672
and start throwing heat.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.874
Hey, can it!

17:54.907 --> 17:55.975
DARLENE: Sorry.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.378
Well, I just don't
think I have it anymore.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.312
You know, I'm sitting there.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.413
I'm trying to
think of something.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.448
I'm try to get an idea.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.982
The only thing that
comes into my head

18:03.015 --> 18:05.118
is that I got to take
either DJ or Darlene

18:05.152 --> 18:06.586
to the dentist or something.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.255
DARLENE: Get off of me
before I kick your head in.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.389
DJ: So what?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.458
I don't think I have
any room for creating.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.693
All my compartments
or too full up.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.162
I'm 37 years old.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.229
I'm a mom.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.564
That's what I am.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.966
Hey, Darlene, get
off your brother.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.867
Come on, DJ.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.669
We're going up to bed.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.036
OK, read to me.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.506
Yeah, just ask
me to write to you.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.309
[music playing]

18:35.114 --> 18:37.384
All All right, buddy,
what will it be?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.953
"The Adventures
of PJ Pamawhack."

18:40.987 --> 18:42.655
Oh, OK.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.790
Well, move your butt over.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.058
You're hogging the bed.

18:46.092 --> 18:46.893
OK.

18:50.897 --> 18:54.434
Once there was a little
kid named PJ Pamawhack.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.136
And his initials were very
close to this one kid I know.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.037
Me.

18:58.070 --> 18:58.971
Right.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.673
And he was also in
the third grade,

19:00.707 --> 19:01.874
like this other kid I know.

19:01.908 --> 19:02.809
Me.

19:02.842 --> 19:08.681
Yeah And one day
it seems PJ was

19:08.715 --> 19:11.251
in his fort, which
was in whatever was

19:11.284 --> 19:14.187
left of the Amazon rain forest.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.988
And it was 8:00 in the
morning, so he'd already

19:16.022 --> 19:17.990
fired the morning
canon, you know,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.992
to scare off any
intruders that might

19:20.026 --> 19:21.428
be coming in there
trying to steal

19:21.461 --> 19:24.731
his collection of war toys.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.933
Intruders?

19:26.966 --> 19:30.603
Yeah, you know, the bad guys,
like Becdar, the two headed,

19:30.637 --> 19:33.240
evil sister monster.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.975
Oh, no.

19:36.008 --> 19:40.813
Oh, yes, and the
cannon was fired.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.016
And from out of the jungle
came a terrible noise.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.552
First there was--

19:45.585 --> 19:46.519
Rumble.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.687
And a--

19:47.720 --> 19:48.855
Grumble.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.723
And a--

19:50.757 --> 19:52.559
I don't know.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.694
A high pitched scream.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.863
[fake scream]

19:58.765 --> 20:04.203
The scream of a
huge, great Big Bird.

20:04.237 --> 20:08.708
Mom, how come PJ Pamawhack
isn't in the library?

20:08.741 --> 20:09.842
Because it's not a book.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.844
It's just some
stories I make up.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.679
Well, it should be.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.083
You think so?

20:17.116 --> 20:17.917
Yeah.

20:21.421 --> 20:25.191
Did I ever tell you think
you are my favorite son?

20:28.728 --> 20:29.929
Story.

20:29.962 --> 20:34.401
Right So this huge bird
swooped out of the jungle--

20:37.036 --> 20:37.837
DAN: Roseanne?

20:49.148 --> 20:49.949
Rosie?

21:12.805 --> 21:13.606
(Whispering) Rosanne?

21:19.178 --> 21:20.046
What are you doing up here?

21:20.079 --> 21:20.880
It's after midnight.

21:31.257 --> 21:34.561
What's the matter
with the office?

21:34.594 --> 21:37.564
[music playing]
