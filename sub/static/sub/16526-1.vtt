00:34.034 --> 00:35.767
<i>The truth is, on Wall Street</i>

00:35.769 --> 00:40.072
<i>a lot of people just weren't
very good at their jobs.</i>

00:40.074 --> 00:43.041
<i>It started out 16 months
ago as a mortgage crisis</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:46.378
<i>and it slowly evolved
into a credit crisis.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.046
<i>We ask about the taxpayers
being on the hook,</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:49.114
<i>guess what?</i>

00:49.116 --> 00:55.320
an unusual step for a lame duck
president, but the country...

00:55.322 --> 00:58.090
<i>Trying to be free
market advocate</i>

00:58.092 --> 01:01.326
<i>when it's really an
"anything goes" mentality.</i>

01:01.328 --> 01:03.061
<i>On Friday, Congress
finally passed</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:05.664
<i>and President Bush
signed into law...</i>

01:05.666 --> 01:07.065
<i>Begin to restore
strength and stability</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:12.738
<i>will buy out Wall Street's
bad investments.</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:15.240
<i>A full-blown
financial storm.</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:19.144
<i>In just 6 months, 3 of the 5
biggest independent firms</i>

01:19.146 --> 01:21.213
<i>on Wall Street have
now disappeared.</i>

01:21.215 --> 01:23.348
<i>numbers are staggering
they don't begin to explain</i>

01:23.350 --> 01:25.083
the greed and incompetence

01:25.085 --> 01:27.085
that created this mess.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.722
<i>No regulation, no
supervision, no discipline.</i>

01:30.724 --> 01:33.258
Terrible debt that was
gnified by reckless borrowing

01:33.260 --> 01:35.227
and complex securities.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.295
<i>The idea that you could
lend money to someone</i>

01:37.297 --> 01:41.099
who could not pay it back is not
an inherently attractive idea.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.101
<i>I don't know why this
company's coming to Congress.</i>

01:43.103 --> 01:45.203
<i>However it seemed to fly
with people who were making</i>

01:45.205 --> 01:46.705
<i>$10 million a year.</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:47.839
<i>They think they can take
that money</i>

01:47.841 --> 01:49.107
<i>and do whatever
they wanna do.</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:50.909
<i>They decide to punish
the country.</i>

01:50.911 --> 01:55.213
<i>Neel Kashkari, the man
in charge of the bailout.</i>

01:55.215 --> 01:57.282
We're supposed to be with the
smartest investors in the
world

01:57.284 --> 01:59.251
and they did it themselves.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.220
<i>I would call it criminal
neglect and incompetence.</i>

02:02.222 --> 02:06.391
<i>They're certainly
not worth it.</i>

02:06.393 --> 02:09.895
<i>Instead of helping consumers
with mortgages and loans.</i>

02:09.896 --> 02:11.129
<i>People at the top of these
firms chose to look away,</i>

02:11.131 --> 02:13.398
<i>to take more risk
to enrich themselves</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:16.468
<i>and it is truly a crime.</i>

02:24.243 --> 02:25.243
What's our risk?

02:25.245 --> 02:26.878
12 billion.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.414
But we have a real
situation here,

02:29.416 --> 02:31.349
our clients are
about to jump ship.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.753
The problem is saving this
company, not the clients.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.254
This company!

02:36.256 --> 02:37.756
We shifted 4 billion
into deposits,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.257
which leaves us with 8.

02:39.259 --> 02:43.261
But that move only buys us
a few more weeks, at best.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.163
I talked to Meryl, they said
they'd ensure the paper

02:45.165 --> 02:47.265
for two weeks but they want
200 million to do it.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.968
Two weeks is nothing, we need
two months at least.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.238
No, it's time for triage.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.906
It's time to dump the
certificates on the market,

02:54.908 --> 02:55.474
all of them.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.909
What about the pension
fund investors?

02:57.911 --> 02:59.778
We're talking over
15 billion.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.913
But if other houses
follow suit,

03:01.915 --> 03:07.319
Our priority is saving this
house and fuck all the others!

03:07.321 --> 03:09.454
Our responsibility begins
and ends with our partners

03:09.456 --> 03:11.389
and our shareholders
and that's it.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.358
Investors gamble, they lose,

03:13.360 --> 03:15.193
that's the risk that
they agreed to take.

03:15.195 --> 03:20.332
why should they complain when
they lose money on the market?

03:20.334 --> 03:22.200
Shit happens, now dump it!

03:22.202 --> 03:24.202
Dump it all
right fucking now!

03:24.204 --> 03:26.938
Even after we dump the stocks
we're still far too exposed

03:26.940 --> 03:28.340
and we've got
no parachute here.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.408
I'm gonna take care of that.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.288
Charlotte?

03:43.290 --> 03:46.858
with the secretary of treasury?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.292
Will do.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.226
Today.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.361
Understood sir, today.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.329
Thanks.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.273
You heard Stancroft,

04:01.275 --> 04:03.308
the entire company's
in jeopardy.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.976
Yeah, with 51 million
in his pocket...

04:04.978 --> 04:07.245
and you know as well as
I do, this is bullshit.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.047
This is Stancroft and his
fucking pissing contest

04:09.049 --> 04:10.248
with his goddamn pluggers.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.585
but we don't really
have a choice, do we?

04:13.587 --> 04:17.322
All right people, listen up!

04:17.324 --> 04:19.357
All right, I've got some
great news for you guys.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.259
In the next three days
we are gonna increase

04:21.261 --> 04:23.528
your incentives by 3 percent.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.997
But I need you to get on
the horn and get all
your top clients

04:25.999 --> 04:28.400
and really push the real
estate growth superfund.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.302
As well, you will be receiving
a memo

04:30.304 --> 04:32.537
in the next couple minutes
detailing all the products

04:32.539 --> 04:34.272
that we need you guys
to unload.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.342
Whoever sells the most
gets the largest bonus.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.277
All right, let's go people!

04:39.279 --> 04:40.545
Move it!

04:40.547 --> 04:41.346
Get those numbers!

04:41.348 --> 04:42.314
Sell, sell!

05:14.313 --> 05:16.381
Hey girl.

05:16.383 --> 05:19.451
Hey boy.

05:41.407 --> 05:43.008
The good news,
as we can see here,

05:43.010 --> 05:45.343
is that the tumors
are completely gone.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.612
That's the good news.

05:47.614 --> 05:51.116
Not bad news, just simply
less than good news.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.486
which is why we're seeing a
recurrence of your symptoms.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.987
But you got everything,
right?

05:55.989 --> 05:56.988
Yes, we see this
on occasion.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.156
Even though the tumors
are gone,

05:58.158 --> 06:02.360
as it were as though
the tumor were still there.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.131
Hormone injections once a
week, that's the first thing.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.532
It's a tricky balancing act,

06:07.534 --> 06:08.500
we'll have to monitor
your levels

06:08.502 --> 06:10.568
until we find the right mix.

06:10.570 --> 06:14.105
Also, your blood sugar level
has sky rocketed.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.174
Again, as a result of the
gland's reaction to the tumor,

06:16.176 --> 06:17.976
so we'll have to treat
you for diabetes.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.511
But she's going to be
all right?

06:19.513 --> 06:21.980
Oh yes, we just have a bit
more ways to get you there,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.982
that's all.

06:23.984 --> 06:27.519
What about, um... we were...

06:27.521 --> 06:28.520
We were planning on
getting pregnant

06:28.522 --> 06:31.456
before the diagnosis.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.391
At this particular time, it
would be an extremely

06:33.393 --> 06:36.127
high-risk pregnancy, both
for you and the baby.

06:36.129 --> 06:40.398
but once we get you
to acceptable levels
with treatment,

06:40.400 --> 06:46.438
which lowers the risk,
then by all means yes.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.473
There's a new gene therapy
that certain patients

06:48.475 --> 06:49.674
have responded well to,

06:49.676 --> 06:51.476
which could get us
to normalcy faster.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.044
It's a little on the
experimental side,

06:53.046 --> 06:54.479
Sign us up, doc.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.146
Yeah.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.481
Excellent!

06:56.483 --> 07:00.585
I know it's difficult but try
hard to relax and not to worry,

07:00.587 --> 07:02.554
it only adds stress to
your system. Okay?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.155
Thank you.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.023
Thanks doc.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.092
You're welcome.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.595
It seems as if your coverage
cap limit has been reached.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.430
Coverage cap limit,
what's that?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.065
It's standard among
many insurers,

07:14.067 --> 07:15.433
you really should call them.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.104
But regarding today,
we'll need payment

07:19.106 --> 07:24.442
Oh, okay... well we can
call in later to
reschedule, we'll talk.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.111
No, no, no... fine, we'll
uh... we'll use the card.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.479
I'm sure it's some
kind of mistake.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.514
If I can get my wallet
out of my pocket...

07:29.516 --> 07:31.516
there you go.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.584
There.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.487
Are you sure you wanna use
the card?

07:35.489 --> 07:37.255
Am I sure?

07:37.257 --> 07:38.056
Not really.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.460
Just call them.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.063
So, should we keep
next Tuesday then?

07:45.065 --> 07:48.266
Yeah, why don't you just
call in and we can...

07:48.268 --> 07:49.467
Okay. Thank you!

07:49.469 --> 07:50.068
Thanks.

07:50.070 --> 07:50.468
Thank you!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.203
Bye.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.506
Thanks.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.574
Coverage cap?

08:04.617 --> 08:06.484
This is the first time it's
ever been mentioned to me.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.553
Now listen, I'm on the
phone to you guys

08:08.555 --> 08:10.255
at least a hundred
times this year...

08:10.257 --> 08:11.756
someone should've
said something.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.558
Sir, it's clearly
stated in the...

08:13.560 --> 08:15.560
I've been buried in a metric
ton of paperwork from you guys

08:15.562 --> 08:19.764
Now, I can't be expected to
catch every line of fine print

08:19.766 --> 08:20.799
from every letter.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.500
I work 6, 7 days a week.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.501
It's company policy, sir...

08:23.503 --> 08:24.769
I get that it's
company policy

08:24.771 --> 08:26.538
but that's got nothing to do...

08:26.540 --> 08:28.573
I'm sorry, there's
nothing more we can do
for you at this point.

08:28.575 --> 08:29.607
So what you're saying
is go fuck yourself,

08:29.609 --> 08:30.608
have a nice day.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.711
I sincerely doubt you're
at all apologetic.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.712
You're not supposed to be,
right?

08:35.715 --> 08:38.683
Mr. Baxford, I'm very sorry.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.605
Sorry.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.540
Oh, baby...

09:02.542 --> 09:05.276
Jim, it's just... it's useless.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.811
Don't say that.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.814
It is, I mean, I'm just...

09:09.816 --> 09:11.583
I'm stuck here and I can't work

09:11.585 --> 09:15.553
and I'm sick all the time, and
you've been working so hard...

09:15.555 --> 09:18.289
I'm working for us.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.559
Jim, I read the invoice
and hormone treatments,

09:21.561 --> 09:25.563
they cost $300 a shot.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.198
That's on top of all
the other medication

09:27.200 --> 09:30.335
and then the gene therapy,
they could be anywhere from

09:30.337 --> 09:32.670
50,000 to 70,000,

09:32.672 --> 09:33.738
and if the insurance
doesn't cover it...

09:33.740 --> 09:37.842
I'm not, I can't let you spend
our whole life savings.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.345
Stop, stop! Stop.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.180
Listen to me, we need
the treatments,

09:42.182 --> 09:43.615
you need to get well.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.583
Once we get well we
can have our baby

09:45.585 --> 09:49.654
and live the life we
wanna live, okay?

09:58.597 --> 10:00.198
Okay, good night.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.269
Good night.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.655
Hey girl.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.724
Hey boy.

10:31.698 --> 10:36.301
What's it look like
I'm doing?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.637
Hey... we're not supposed
to get pregnant yet.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.707
We can practice.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.841
Yeah...

10:43.843 --> 10:47.712
Yeah?

10:50.416 --> 10:54.485
Jim, I love you so much.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.676
Dude, that sucks!

11:18.678 --> 11:20.311
There's an actual coverage cap
on the insurance,

11:20.313 --> 11:22.680
that means that there's
really literally like,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.482
a limit to how much you
can spend on Rosie

11:24.484 --> 11:25.950
per month for her medical?

11:25.952 --> 11:30.455
it says if you get too sick
and it's too expensive,

11:30.457 --> 11:31.723
they stop fucking paying.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.826
I was planning on having
by the time I was 60.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.694
I guess if I get sick I'd
be better off swallowing

11:36.696 --> 11:38.830
my own gun.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.999
Rosie's worried out
of her fucking mind.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.800
So what are you gonna do?

11:42.802 --> 11:44.702
I got some money tucked away,
army disability,

11:44.704 --> 11:46.304
stuff like that.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.705
I'll call my broker.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.440
I hear the market's
shit right now man,

11:49.442 --> 11:50.975
what are you invested in?

11:50.977 --> 11:53.044
Structured notes,
whatever's safest.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.046
Fuck, I hope so bro.

11:55.048 --> 11:59.784
I'll call in the lunch.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.399
Fuck.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.736
I'm not making enough.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.805
What up you lazy bastards?

12:20.807 --> 12:22.473
What'd you do,
just roll out of bed?

12:22.475 --> 12:23.341
It's Jim Baxford.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.742
No, no... second shift.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.344
Lunch for you,
breakfast for us.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.746
Just sit down and shut up,
we already ordered for you.

12:28.748 --> 12:33.818
Tom gets the cheeseburger,
Jim... chili.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.354
Cold chili, and he's always
surprised, you know?

12:36.356 --> 12:37.522
But he always finishes.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.825
Give me a couple of
days, call the office.

12:40.827 --> 12:44.762
Oh uh, what's going on with
my funds?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.497
<i>Uh... Jim, look I
really gotta...</i>

12:46.499 --> 12:49.067
<i>I'm in a... I'll talk to
you in a couple days...</i>

12:49.069 --> 12:52.837
Hello?

12:55.774 --> 12:57.408
That's what he meant, that's
what he was thinking about.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.877
Fucking hell.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.846
Hey man.

13:01.848 --> 13:02.580
Fucking asshole.

13:02.582 --> 13:06.584
My broker, phone
keeps dropping out.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.853
Everybody's cheesed
about their broker these days.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.390
Frank and me just learned
that we have lost 20 percent

13:12.392 --> 13:13.991
of our pension.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.928
Gone, like watery piss
in the wind.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.798
I don't know, bad investments
on the part of idiots like us.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.867
to some of those
administration meetings.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.602
Those meetings are bullshit!

13:24.604 --> 13:26.437
Our administrators only
do what's good for them,

13:26.439 --> 13:29.073
no matter how many people go
to those goddamn meetings,

13:29.075 --> 13:33.111
they should call it
collective ball scratching.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.546
You know what me and Freddy
do with our day?

13:35.548 --> 13:38.816
We bust homeless people for
sleeping in the park, or uh...

13:38.818 --> 13:41.586
we bust some stupid
shmuck for jaywalking,

13:41.588 --> 13:43.121
but the real fucking criminals,

13:43.123 --> 13:45.823
they're downtown
on Wall Street,

13:45.825 --> 13:49.894
wearing suits that cost more
than any of us make in a year.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.563
And those mother fuckers steal
more money than any asshole

13:52.565 --> 13:54.899
on Riker's Island
ever dreamed of stealing,

13:54.901 --> 13:56.467
and if they get caught,
which they won't get caught,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.936
but if they did they'd
get an ankle bracelet

13:58.938 --> 14:00.638
and put under house arrest.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.874
In their mansions where
the hookers come to you.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.442
Yeah and they spend
the night.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.943
Well the expensive
kind of hookers

14:05.945 --> 14:07.445
that you want to
spend the night,

14:07.447 --> 14:08.846
Wall Street hookers.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.615
Wall Street... pow, pow!

14:10.617 --> 14:13.151
Fuck those guys you know
what I mean, fuck them.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.486
Yeah, you guys are doing a
real good job of cheering

14:15.488 --> 14:16.854
my buddy up over here.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.189
Oh, we're just talking shit,
Jim.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.658
I'm sure you'll be all right.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.927
Hey fellas, the usual?

14:22.929 --> 14:24.495
I didn't order fries,
that's his.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.464
All around.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.031
Beef for you.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.466
Where's my chili?

14:28.468 --> 14:29.000
It's coming!

14:29.002 --> 14:30.134
My fucking chili.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.937
Make sure it's warm.

14:32.939 --> 14:33.971
It's freezing cold.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.139
Great.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.607
I don't know why we come here,

14:36.609 --> 14:38.876
the food sucks.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.877
But the site's good.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.878
At least it's warm.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.747
That's true.

14:43.882 --> 14:46.684
How's Rosie doing, Jim?

14:46.686 --> 14:47.885
She's hanging in there.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.520
It's been a tough year,
you know?

14:49.522 --> 14:50.221
She's a fighter.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.489
Give her our best.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.623
Yeah.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.892
She's a trooper that one,
Rosie.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.960
She's a good girl.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.196
How's your wife?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.163
Great.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.199
She's cheating on me.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.033
What?

15:02.035 --> 15:08.239
If you guys need anything else,
just give me a holler.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.907
What happened?

15:09.909 --> 15:13.010
I'm a cop, I got married,
it's inevitable.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.111
It is.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.047
How did you find out?

15:16.049 --> 15:18.716
I read her text messages.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.651
Erotic reading,
let me tell you.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.719
Well what are you gonna do?

15:21.721 --> 15:27.191
whoever he is, or to thank him
from the bottom of my heart

15:27.193 --> 15:30.061
for keeping her occupied
and off my back.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.963
It's a real conundrum here.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.965
Now, can we just talk
about something else, huh?

15:33.967 --> 15:35.933
Talk about his girlfriend.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.602
Who, yours?

15:37.604 --> 15:42.039
I heard on the news and
they were talking about

15:42.041 --> 15:44.141
who you'd wanna have
sex with, right?

15:44.143 --> 15:49.547
A., your wife or B., before
he could even answer,

15:49.549 --> 15:50.281
she could... blah!

15:52.051 --> 15:52.683
I fucked it up.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.024
Husband and wife are
laying in bed...

16:00.026 --> 16:02.960
the wife says to the husband,
"listen, when I die

16:02.962 --> 16:06.998
would you get another
woman in my bed?"

16:07.000 --> 16:09.767
He says, "uh... yeah."

16:09.769 --> 16:13.971
She says "uh, well
will you marry her?",

16:13.973 --> 16:17.041
he says "well, maybe".

16:17.043 --> 16:21.045
She says, "will you let
her use my golf clubs?",

16:21.047 --> 16:22.046
he says "no!

16:22.048 --> 16:23.114
She's left handed".

16:25.151 --> 16:26.984
You guys wonder why
you're divorced,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.787
Hey, you know you
did it right Jim,

16:29.789 --> 16:32.089
you didn't marry a cop's wife.

16:32.091 --> 16:35.626
You married a girl
you actually love.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.061
Yeah, I hear that.

16:37.063 --> 16:40.264
She's a keeper that Rosie,
for sure.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.600
Cheers to you guys.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.200
Cheers.

16:43.202 --> 16:46.604
Jim and Rosie.

16:49.741 --> 16:52.009

How you feeling?

17:28.181 --> 17:31.048
A little better.

Good.

I have a treatment

17:53.072 --> 17:54.338
Absolutely.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.741
And about the payment,
uh...

17:56.743 --> 17:58.075
Babe, we gotta use
the cards

17:58.077 --> 17:59.710
until we can get
this thing fixed.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.846
Jim, they just raised the
interest rate on the cards

18:01.848 --> 18:03.080
and I've already put some
bills on there, so...

18:03.082 --> 18:04.181
Babe, it's all right.

18:04.183 --> 18:08.085
Well it's just you've been
working so hard lately, and...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.854
I know, I know... what
choice do we have?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.155
I'm doing this for us.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.423
Okay.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.191
You coming to bed?

18:14.193 --> 18:15.726
In a minute.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.128
All right.

<i>Chris Dodd, chairman of

19:05.243 --> 19:07.311
Ouch... All right,
see you next week.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.380
Let's get outta here.

19:36.441 --> 19:39.210
Jim...

19:39.212 --> 19:42.346
What the hell's going on?

19:42.348 --> 19:47.218
but your note's been
d-listed from the exchange.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.221
D-listed, what does
that mean?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.823
There's an investigation
going on right now.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.259
Into what?

19:55.261 --> 20:00.464
An investigation into
some investment portfolios.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.466
It looks like a significant
portion of your fund

20:02.468 --> 20:08.372
was diverted into paper that
is, well... a little suspect.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.208
Meaning, you don't know...

20:11.210 --> 20:12.209
No, no I don't.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.477
No one knows right now.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.212
You're my broker,
it's what you do.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.983
How could you put my money
into anything suspicious?

20:18.985 --> 20:26.290
I only invest in clean
deals but it seems the firm
itself is behind all this.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.225
Look, I can't really tell
you anything else.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.227
This thing is a legal snowball.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.264
Look, we'll just have to wait
until the investigation

20:33.266 --> 20:35.032
is through but it...

20:35.034 --> 20:38.435
I mean it seems that your
investment was good

20:38.437 --> 20:42.239
and as it should be but then
everything lost its value.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.974
The question is did
the firm have knowledge

20:43.976 --> 20:46.510
that your original investment
was bad?

20:46.512 --> 20:48.913
You just said you only deal
in clean deals.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.381
I do.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.883
I do but I'm the player
here, okay?

20:52.885 --> 20:54.418
Not the whole game.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.355
You're not the only one hurting
because of this.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.559
the investments of a lot
of unfortunate people...

21:01.561 --> 21:05.596
Unfortunate?!

21:05.598 --> 21:07.331
Unfortunate people?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.266
You told me, you promised me

21:09.268 --> 21:12.269
I'd make 8 to 10 percent of
my investment, guaranteed.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.272
Yeah, and that is what
my firm told me.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.309
Look, I... I searched it
out, I did my research,

21:18.311 --> 21:24.882
my office manager told me to
put my clients into this.

21:24.884 --> 21:28.285
What else did you put
the money in to?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.921
Notes backed by
commercial real estate.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.058
I mean look, these looked
like great buildings...

21:34.060 --> 21:36.393
I checked the specs,
I did the research,

21:36.395 --> 21:39.597
they looked like they'd
be at full capacity, okay?

21:39.599 --> 21:42.900
Did you, did you inspect
these buildings?

21:42.902 --> 21:45.402
Did you inspect these
properties?

21:45.404 --> 21:47.571
The people that do all
the research told me

21:47.573 --> 21:50.441
that this was the real deal.

21:50.443 --> 21:53.077
So what do we do now?

21:53.079 --> 21:56.947
We'll get some information
regarding the investigation

21:56.949 --> 22:01.318
and... look, I'm telling you
it's gonna take a while though,

22:01.320 --> 22:02.920
before this whole
thing is clear.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.489
You're telling me I've lost
all my money.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.324
No, not necessarily.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.327
There's gonna be some
large lawsuits.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.631
I just want my money back.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.367
Jim, that's not how
investment works.

22:16.369 --> 22:20.137
I mean, you gotta pay
to play.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.405
This is not a fucking
game to me,

22:21.407 --> 22:24.341
this is my fucking life
savings to me, you fuck.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.343
Look, I understand.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.945
Hey, I feel your pain,
I do.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.481
I lost a lot of money too.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.983
But that's how investment
works, man.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.485
I'm sorry.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.554
It gives and it takes away.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.402
Yeah, how are we doing
with these sales?

22:51.404 --> 22:52.436
We're at 20 percent.

22:52.438 --> 22:57.508
I totally agree but the
price is falling.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.110
Oh, Jesus.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.645
The price is falling
to where, nothing?

23:01.647 --> 23:05.416
but our clients are starting
to question our credibility.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.551
Well that's good, some
things never change.

23:07.553 --> 23:11.188
All right, you keep
me posted.

23:27.005 --> 23:27.571
Rosie?

23:27.573 --> 23:31.475
Sorry I'm late, I had to cover
for one of the guys at work.

23:31.477 --> 23:32.409
Everything okay?

23:32.411 --> 23:34.411
Yeah, it's fine.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.013
You know you can tell me,
you know.

23:36.015 --> 23:39.083
I know.

23:41.019 --> 23:43.721
The bank called.

23:43.723 --> 23:44.621
They did?

23:44.623 --> 23:46.023
What'd they say?

23:46.025 --> 23:47.424
I don't know, the machine
picked it up.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.626
The message said they
needed you to call

23:49.628 --> 23:52.229
or get down there
as soon as possible.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.698
Our mortgage, our interest
rate, something like that.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.166
I mean, I was gonna call...

23:56.168 --> 23:59.036
I'll take care of the bank.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.038
I'll call them tomorrow.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.041
And there's this.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.511
It's from my broker.

24:07.513 --> 24:11.548
Jim... what's going on?

24:11.550 --> 24:13.183
Baby, nothing's going on.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.718
Please, you gotta
stop worrying.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.222
Let me take care of the
small stuff, all right?

24:18.224 --> 24:20.090
You need to get well.

24:20.092 --> 24:25.462
Okay, I'm gonna go draw
a bath, play some music,

24:25.464 --> 24:26.597
light some candles.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.598
Light some candles?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.733
Yeah, you should join me.

24:29.735 --> 24:30.467
All right.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.170
Okay.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.817
Jim, I don't know
what to tell you.

24:46.819 --> 24:51.488
You're the one who said put my
money in bullshit real estate.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.091
It says right here that I am now
liable for another 60 grand.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.492
Are you out of your fucking
mind?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.561
Jim, I told you, no one saw
this coming.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.263
I'm gonna sue you.

24:59.265 --> 25:04.234
Okay just calm down, we'll get
to the bottom of this.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.537
I need you to cover me
for a couple days.

25:06.539 --> 25:07.504
<i>No worries, man.</i>

25:07.506 --> 25:08.572
<i>More problems?</i>

25:08.574 --> 25:09.273
Yeah, something's come up.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.842
No she's fine, I've gotta
take care of a few things.

25:11.844 --> 25:12.643
Okay, take care buddy.

25:12.645 --> 25:15.379
All right.

25:41.306 --> 25:42.806
So you invested and you lost,

25:42.808 --> 25:45.542
now they want more money
to cover expenses and losses.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.177
I'll file a lawsuit, simple.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.812
So I won't have to pay
the 60 grand?

25:48.814 --> 25:51.715
I'll make sure you don't have
to pay the 60,000

25:51.717 --> 25:53.617
or any of the interest they're
laying on top of that,

25:53.619 --> 25:56.587
but... your original
investment,

25:56.589 --> 25:58.856
you'll have to talk to
the ADA about that.

25:58.858 --> 26:03.560
I think... your ma would
join that case.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.630
Better fucking bet your life
I will.

26:06.632 --> 26:09.566
Now then, I work on
a retainer basis

26:09.568 --> 26:11.568
so I'll need 10 thousand
dollars in advance

26:11.570 --> 26:12.836
to file a civil complaint.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.872
10 grand, I ain't got
10 grand.

26:14.874 --> 26:19.143
No problem, lots of lawyers
work for cheap.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.747
Look Jim, I'm not dealing
with your investment.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.582
It looks like there
has been a crime,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.351
and the DA's office is
dealing with that.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.353
Now if this is true, I'd
be happy to assist you

26:29.355 --> 26:31.255
if you decide to
sue for damages.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.658
But we have to start by
filing this complaint

26:34.660 --> 26:38.695
for injunctive relief to protect
you from the 60,000 demand

26:38.697 --> 26:40.631
and the interest it's going
to accumulate.

26:40.633 --> 26:45.769
I'm sorry Jim, but I'm
looking at over 40 hours
of work on your case.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.237
Come back when you've
got the 10 grand,

26:47.239 --> 26:48.805
that's my minimum.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.607
You can borrow the money
or get a credit card

26:50.609 --> 26:53.944
but that's the best I can do.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.779
Somewhat ironically
I'm like investing.

26:55.781 --> 27:01.218
With attorneys, you
usually get what you pay for.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.620
I'll see what I can do.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.656
Call me!

27:05.658 --> 27:08.725
Or not...

27:14.699 --> 27:15.732
You all right?

27:15.734 --> 27:17.434
Yeah, hanging in there.

27:17.436 --> 27:20.704
Hey, is that back door supposed
to be open?

27:20.706 --> 27:22.272
How you been man?

27:22.274 --> 27:23.373
Hey, what's up man?

27:23.375 --> 27:24.408
Any hold up today?

27:25.811 --> 27:31.648
Same old shit, different day.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.850
they expect you to
pay 60 grand now?

27:33.852 --> 27:37.287
It's happening all over, I lost
18,000 in a mutual fund,

27:37.289 --> 27:39.289
college money for my son.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.658
Yeah, my folks lost
their nest egg.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.327
I'm fucked.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.862
Why, you don't have $60,000?

27:45.864 --> 27:47.331
What do you fucking think?

27:47.333 --> 27:50.701
You got family you
could borrow from?

27:50.703 --> 27:51.935
Not an option.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.938
but I could scratch
up a few bucks.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.707
Yeah, we could take up a
collection with the guys.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.675
Guys, guys...

27:58.677 --> 28:01.478
I'm just gonna
refuse to pay it.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.780
We gotta get to the job.

28:03.782 --> 28:04.815
Lunch is on me, all right?

28:04.817 --> 28:07.684
Allow me.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.687
Thanks guys, I
appreciate it.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.756
Look, hang in there.

28:12.758 --> 28:13.690
It can only get better.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.693
Yeah.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.728
Change?

28:17.730 --> 28:18.862
It's for you, sweetie.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.731
Thanks.

28:20.733 --> 28:24.501
Later.

28:27.805 --> 28:33.877
Jim... I got uh... 10 grand
I can loan you.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.380
Please Jim, listen to me
man.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.748
Sean, forget about it.

28:37.750 --> 28:41.518
Look, I don't have a girlfriend,
I don't have a family,

28:41.520 --> 28:45.856
I don't have anything...
okay?

28:45.858 --> 28:48.992
Please, let me help you out,
it would mean a lot to me.

28:48.994 --> 28:54.731
I might take you up on that,
pay this lawyer.

28:54.733 --> 28:58.802
Just hang in there.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.424
It's called an adjustable rate
for a reason,

29:20.426 --> 29:21.958
when the housing
market changes...

29:21.960 --> 29:24.361
so do the interest rates,
that's how that works.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.763
Listen, uh... my premiums have
doubled in the blink of an eye,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.765
I'm not gonna be able to
keep up at this rate.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.767
Yeah, you got a favourable
deal when you signed.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.836
The terms of which was that
a specified point in time

29:32.838 --> 29:36.373
the interest rate would
reflect the market.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.774
Can we refinance?

29:37.776 --> 29:42.379
Well your net worth has
taken a significant hit

29:42.381 --> 29:44.381
over the last few
days and your wife,

29:44.383 --> 29:47.784
she hasn't worked for
a year or so, right?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.519
Yeah, she got sick.

29:49.521 --> 29:55.826
But in light of all of that,
refinancing wouldn't be prudent

29:55.828 --> 29:57.794
for our bank at this time.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.795
So you're shafting me?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.097
No, no... it's not me,

30:00.099 --> 30:02.099
it's the guidelines
handed down from above.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.868
If it were up to me, I would
help you out.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.837
Uh, you could always try to
sell your house.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.071
I can't sell my house
is this market.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.941
I'm sorry, I don't know
what else to tell you.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.410
You could declare bankruptcy,
a lot of people do that.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.612
Fuck you.

30:15.614 --> 30:18.682
That's a fair response,
I suppose.

30:31.896 --> 30:32.896
Hey!

30:32.898 --> 30:33.630
Hey.

30:33.632 --> 30:34.898
You at the bank?

30:34.900 --> 30:35.899
Yeah.

30:35.901 --> 30:37.901
Well what was it about?

30:37.903 --> 30:41.505
Like I said, don't worry
about it.

30:41.507 --> 30:41.872
All right?

30:41.874 --> 30:42.906
Mmmhmm.

30:42.908 --> 30:46.676
Good.

31:14.505 --> 31:15.906
Ahh... I knew you'd have no
problems coming up with this.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.908
I got it from a friend.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.911
It will and then I'll see if
I can find other investors

31:20.913 --> 31:22.612
who got burned on this

31:22.614 --> 31:24.881
and put together a
collective lawsuit.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.916
Collective ball scratching.

31:25.918 --> 31:26.883
What's that?

31:26.885 --> 31:27.684
It's just a joke.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.554
Not funny, I guess.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.889
Don't underestimate the
power of a large group

31:32.891 --> 31:34.925
when it comes to
asking for damages.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.693
I hope so.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.095
So what do I do about this
letter demanding 60 grand?

31:39.097 --> 31:40.664
I'll contact the other party,

31:40.666 --> 31:41.898
I will let them know
I am your attorney

31:41.900 --> 31:44.901
and that you will
not be paying.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.505
You know, there may be
another way out of this.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.173
You take the fall on
this but it could end

31:50.175 --> 31:52.242
all this drama for
you instantly.

31:52.244 --> 31:56.680
Would you be willing to write
off your initial investment

31:56.682 --> 31:59.516
and walk away if these guys
let you out of the 60,000?

31:59.518 --> 32:01.952
It's something you
should consider.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.653
It could be years before
the real estate market

32:03.655 --> 32:04.955
bounces back.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.656
If for some reason I can get
the court to grant

32:06.658 --> 32:08.925
injunctive relief to
stop these guys,

32:08.927 --> 32:12.062
years of interest on
this claim against you.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.997
This motion, it's gonna
work right?

32:13.999 --> 32:17.234
Most likely, but nothing
in law is for certain.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.002
I'm just offering
this as an option

32:19.004 --> 32:21.938
but if they're willing to let
you play ball and back off,

32:21.940 --> 32:24.007
then you can put it
all behind you.

32:24.009 --> 32:26.276
It'd be nice, huh?

32:26.278 --> 32:28.044
Okay, don't think
about it for too long,

32:28.046 --> 32:30.080
the time to act is now.

32:30.082 --> 32:35.719
You just paid me, I can either
file the complaint as planned

32:35.721 --> 32:38.989
or I can try and negotiate
directly with them

32:38.991 --> 32:41.992
but I need to do one
or the other.

32:41.994 --> 32:45.061
I need a day.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.130
Half a day would be better.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.965
All right, I uh...
I got a meeting

32:48.967 --> 32:51.067
with the assistant
district attorney today.

32:51.069 --> 32:51.968
Oh yeah, good.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.770
I'll put that in the letter.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.107
Thanks.

32:57.109 --> 33:00.176
Let me know what happens.

33:45.057 --> 33:49.025
I'm sure I double checked
the schedule when you called

33:49.027 --> 33:52.762
doesn't have time in his
schedule for you today.

33:52.764 --> 33:57.033
I'm sorry, I can leave him
a message if you'd like.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.803
Well um, maybe you can answer
a few questions for me.

33:59.805 --> 34:02.072
I'm afraid that I wouldn't
be any help with anything.

34:02.074 --> 34:05.108
I'm not even a legal secretary,
I'm just an assistant.

34:05.110 --> 34:08.311
Just the assistant,
that's your excuse?

34:08.313 --> 34:10.313
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

34:10.315 --> 34:12.782
Have you heard of my name
at all?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.050
No, I'm sorry sir.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.118
No, I don't.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.252
You haven't.

34:16.254 --> 34:17.320
Myra, coffee please.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.089
I need to speak to you.

34:19.091 --> 34:20.056
Mr. Marwood!

34:20.058 --> 34:23.126
Mr. Marwood is very busy.

34:23.128 --> 34:24.694
Please, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

34:24.696 --> 34:25.795
I need to speak to him.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.164
Don't make me have
to call security.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.065
I am security,
you fucking bitch.

34:30.068 --> 34:34.237
Get your fucking hands
off me.

35:13.144 --> 35:16.179
So... how did it go today?

35:16.181 --> 35:19.315
The bastard didn't have time
for me.

35:19.317 --> 35:22.118
You had an appointment, man.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.286
Yeah.

35:23.288 --> 35:27.223
You gonna be okay?

35:33.164 --> 35:35.165
<i>You have reached the voicemail
of Patterson Law Group,</i>

35:35.167 --> 35:37.133
<i>please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

35:37.135 --> 35:41.204
These bastards, they never
answer their fucking phones.

35:49.747 --> 35:58.188
Hey uh... about the money,
seriously...

35:58.190 --> 36:00.290
don't even worry
about paying me back.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.226
It ain't no thing but
a chicken wing, man.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.427
I appreciate that.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.162
I've done everything,
I went to the DA,

36:06.164 --> 36:11.334
I went to the lawyer...
fucking banks.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.169
The system's rigged
motherfucker!

36:13.171 --> 36:16.239
Come on, you know that shit.

36:16.241 --> 36:21.177
Yeah.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.247
Yeah it is.

36:26.917 --> 36:30.987
Let's go get some alcohol,
make the pain go away.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.924
<i>Perhaps the best example
of how this all works</i>

36:34.926 --> 36:36.459
<i>is in the AIG bailout.</i>

36:36.461 --> 36:39.929
<i>When AIG went bankrupt...</i>

36:47.972 --> 36:50.240
Listen lady, I've left him
a ton of messages, a ton.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.975
He's the guy in charge
of prosecuting

36:51.977 --> 36:53.276
the brokerage houses,
right?

36:53.278 --> 36:54.944
<i>Yes, that's one of
many cases.</i>

36:54.946 --> 36:57.213
Well I need to speak to him
urgently, like right now.

36:57.215 --> 37:02.218
100 cents on the dollar was paid
to the Goldman Sachs debtors.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.486
<i>When a firm goes bankrupt
you don't expect</i>

37:03.488 --> 37:05.221
<i>to get a hundred percent
of those dollars</i>

37:05.223 --> 37:07.557
<i>because it's a bankrupt firm,
it can't pay its debts.</i>

37:28.512 --> 37:30.580
Thank you.

37:33.517 --> 37:36.252
You can expect to get maybe 50
cents on the dollar, but no...

37:36.254 --> 37:39.322
<i>the American taxpayer
pays Goldman Sachs</i>

37:39.324 --> 37:41.891
<i>100 cents on the dollar
and all those...</i>

37:41.893 --> 37:48.565
<i>were also secretary
of the treasury.</i>

37:53.271 --> 37:54.571
<i>The occupy Wall
Street protests,</i>

37:54.573 --> 37:57.040
<i>a few thousand people,
I do not understand</i>

37:57.042 --> 38:01.277
<i>why the American people are
not up in arms about this.</i>

38:01.279 --> 38:03.947
<i>These are criminal acts,</i>

38:03.949 --> 38:09.018
<i>this is blatant fraud
and conflict of interest.</i>

38:14.292 --> 38:16.593
<i>There's no government
investigation,</i>

38:16.595 --> 38:21.364
<i>charges have been laid,
one's even looking into it!</i>

38:21.366 --> 38:24.500
<i>And yet all the information
is there in the open to see.</i>

38:24.502 --> 38:27.570
<i>These are criminals walking
in our midst.</i>

38:32.109 --> 38:35.078
<i>And now the banks want
the same piece of faith</i>

38:35.080 --> 38:36.312
that we have in our government.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.648
<i>The banks have been
trading with ideas,</i>

38:38.650 --> 38:41.918
they just have derivatives and
swaps that move back and forth.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.953
<i>This has to stop,
this can't go on.</i>

38:43.955 --> 38:48.358
<i>We have to underpin our
dealings with actual wealth,</i>

38:48.360 --> 38:51.361
<i>not pieces of paper
that are simply ideas</i>

38:51.363 --> 38:54.430
<i>from rich men.</i>

38:54.432 --> 38:54.964
Hey baby.

38:54.966 --> 38:55.965
Hey.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.333
What are you doing here?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.601
You got treatment this
morning, right?

38:58.603 --> 38:59.602
I know, I cancelled it.

38:59.604 --> 39:03.606
Our cards, they declined
last time and the...

39:03.608 --> 39:05.942
the debt people, they've
been calling the house,

39:05.944 --> 39:09.445
so I called the bank and...

39:09.447 --> 39:13.650
I know what's going on.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.351
We're broke, aren't we?

39:15.353 --> 39:18.354
We had all of our money
in that fund and it's...

39:18.356 --> 39:21.457
it's gone, isn't it?

39:21.459 --> 39:25.395
Jim...

39:25.397 --> 39:26.963
Jim, it's okay.

39:26.965 --> 39:31.401
I understand, you... you
were just protecting me.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.970
It'll be okay.

39:33.972 --> 39:38.374
I'm gonna get the money back,
I'm gonna fix this.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.543
Oh God, this has been
so hard on you.

39:40.545 --> 39:44.447
You're getting gray hair and
wrinkles all because of me.

39:44.449 --> 39:48.418
It's gonna be all right,
you're gonna be all right.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.688
No, I'm not.

39:51.690 --> 39:55.391
But it's okay.

39:55.393 --> 40:00.196
I just, I really... I wanted us
to have a baby.

40:00.198 --> 40:03.399
You know I know that he
would look just like you

40:03.401 --> 40:06.169
and I couldn't wish
for anything more.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.538
Baby, don't say that.

40:08.540 --> 40:13.409
We're gonna sell the house...

40:13.411 --> 40:15.578
Jim...

40:34.732 --> 40:36.065
It'll be okay, it's...

40:36.067 --> 40:39.135
I'm calling my lawyer.

40:43.241 --> 40:46.442
Uh, Jim Baxford
for Mr. Patterson.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.444
<i>One moment please.</i>

40:48.446 --> 40:52.482
I uh, I got a letter here saying
they're gonna foreclose on us

40:52.484 --> 40:55.218
and uh, the bank's
cutting us off

40:55.220 --> 40:56.619
all because of this
bullshit real estate.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.721
You offered to waive
my investment

40:58.723 --> 41:00.490
if I knocked off the 60 grand.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.559
<i>but you didn't give me
an answer in time.</i>

41:03.561 --> 41:05.061
<i>If I could've gotten
to them earlier...</i>

41:05.063 --> 41:06.462
I called you back
the same fucking day.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.464
<i>At the end of a long
Friday after 4 PM,</i>

41:08.466 --> 41:10.533
<i>if I remember correctly.</i>

41:10.535 --> 41:14.203
That means I didn't get back to
them until Monday or Tuesday,

41:14.205 --> 41:18.474
What about this motion
you filed, the relief thing?

41:18.476 --> 41:20.476
<i>The broker you invested
with went bankrupt</i>

41:20.478 --> 41:22.478
<i>their assets were purchasd
by another company,</i>

41:22.480 --> 41:24.614
<i>there's no one to file a
motion against right now</i>

41:24.616 --> 41:26.682
<i>since the broker's in
bankruptcy you need to hire</i>

41:26.684 --> 41:29.519
a bankruptcy attorney to lift a
thing called an automatic stay,

41:29.521 --> 41:31.587
<i>which really is a pain
in the ass.</i>

41:31.589 --> 41:33.489
What about the real estate
company, what about that?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.558
<i>Well they're also under the
protection of bankruptcy court</i>

41:35.560 --> 41:39.128
<i>It's part of the bankruptcy
law that says you can't take</i>

41:39.130 --> 41:41.230
<i>any action against a
company in bankruptcy</i>

41:41.232 --> 41:43.499
<i>without first hiring another
lawyer and getting permission</i>

41:43.501 --> 41:45.501
from the bankruptcy court.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.570
It's complicated!

41:47.572 --> 41:49.305
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

41:49.307 --> 41:50.573
Why'd I fucking hire you?

41:50.575 --> 41:52.308
<i>I haven't heard from
you in 2 weeks</i>

41:52.310 --> 41:54.544
<i>and certainly wasn't privy to
the inner financial workings</i>

41:54.546 --> 41:59.582
<i>The bankruptcy filings were
just as much a surprise to me.</i>

41:59.584 --> 42:01.317
<i>So let me give you
my best advice...</i>

42:01.319 --> 42:03.619
<i>pay the 60 grand,</i>

42:03.621 --> 42:05.788
I'll file the same injunctive
relief motion we talked about

42:05.790 --> 42:07.590
<i>to try and prevent you
from having to pay</i>

42:07.592 --> 42:11.794
<i>and I won't ask your for any
more money from you for me.</i>

42:11.796 --> 42:13.529
<i>How's that sound?</i>

42:13.531 --> 42:14.597
I don't have 60 grand.

42:14.599 --> 42:16.132
<i>Jim, I'll get this one.</i>

42:16.134 --> 42:18.568
<i>Call me later...</i>

42:18.570 --> 42:22.205
This is all my fault.

42:22.207 --> 42:25.675
No, I got sick and I put
us in debt.

42:25.677 --> 42:28.611
It's not your fault, it's
the banks, the CEO's,

42:28.613 --> 42:34.150
Jim, I just... I hate what
this is doing to you.

42:34.152 --> 42:37.286
I'm sorry.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.888
I gotta go to work.

42:38.890 --> 42:49.632
Jim... Jim...

43:04.848 --> 43:06.916
Andy, you wanted to see me?

43:06.918 --> 43:08.618
Yeah, come on in.

43:08.620 --> 43:14.757
Close the door please.

43:14.759 --> 43:18.661
Jim... we've been contacted
by a couple of lawyers

43:18.663 --> 43:22.365
and collection agencies in
the last couple of days...

43:22.367 --> 43:23.599
it seems that you have
a lot of debts...

43:23.601 --> 43:24.700
It's not what you think.

43:24.702 --> 43:27.637
They've got a judgment
against you,

43:27.639 --> 43:30.640
a lien to garnish your
wages on a monthly basis.

43:30.642 --> 43:31.607
How much?

43:31.609 --> 43:33.643
You keep 800 per month.

43:33.645 --> 43:37.380
Right, um... let me speak
to my lawyer

43:37.382 --> 43:39.649
before you give these
guys anything.

43:39.651 --> 43:45.755
Jim, I'm sorry but we're gonna
have to let you go.

43:45.757 --> 43:48.291
We cannot have employees that
are having financial troubles

43:48.293 --> 43:50.760
protecting our money.

43:50.762 --> 43:52.628
You get what I mean?

43:52.630 --> 43:54.964
We're a bonded firm,
we'll lose our insurance,

43:54.966 --> 43:57.366
we'll lose our clients...

43:57.368 --> 43:58.801
we just can't have
you working here,

43:58.803 --> 44:00.803
not under these conditions.

44:00.805 --> 44:07.410
Think of how it looks,
and it's not good.

44:07.412 --> 44:09.645
Severance...

44:09.647 --> 44:12.748
What about my insurance?

44:12.750 --> 44:15.451
You can do COBRA
on the insurance.

44:15.453 --> 44:19.388
That's 600 a month, how
can I keep her alive on that?

44:21.259 --> 44:23.793
The check is your
official severance,

44:23.795 --> 44:26.329
but we owe you back pay,
overtime...

44:26.331 --> 44:28.831
you put in a lot of hours and
you've been a loyal employee,

44:28.833 --> 44:32.668
so instead of a check I had
them issue it in cash.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.670
It's a bit of a bump, 9,000.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.806
Cash is better, I figure
banks and collections

44:36.808 --> 44:39.675
will never know,
just between us.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.412
I appreciate that.

44:43.414 --> 44:46.482
And I'm gonna need your weapon
and employee ID too.

45:15.712 --> 45:17.313
Jim... hey man, listen...

45:17.315 --> 45:20.516
I'm sorry, I didn't know!

48:47.958 --> 48:49.658
<i>I can't answer the phone
right now,</i>

48:49.660 --> 48:50.926
<i>just leave a message.</i>

48:50.928 --> 48:53.662
<i>Have a good day.</i>

48:54.264 --> 48:56.999
Hey Jim what's up,
it's Sean.

48:57.001 --> 48:59.602
Look, I didn't know it was
gonna happen, all right?

48:59.604 --> 49:00.936
I'm really sorry.

49:00.938 --> 49:05.007
I love you bro,
please give me a call.

49:25.228 --> 49:29.265
Rosie?

49:41.244 --> 49:44.313
Rosie?

49:47.984 --> 49:51.053
Rosie?

49:52.722 --> 49:56.792
Rosie... Baby...

50:01.064 --> 50:02.131
Baby?

50:07.103 --> 50:14.043
Oh my God, baby...

50:14.045 --> 50:17.112
Oh my God, oh no... Rosie?

50:21.651 --> 50:22.851
Rosie...

50:32.028 --> 50:34.096
911...

50:36.032 --> 50:40.369
Rosie, Rosie...

52:00.784 --> 52:04.920
God visits us with
many mysteries in life,

52:04.922 --> 52:08.857
unexpected death is
the most challenging.

52:08.859 --> 52:14.797
when God leaves us speechless
in the face of death,

52:14.799 --> 52:19.401
he reminds us all we have
is forgiveness.

52:19.403 --> 52:24.206
We must set our anger aside
and look to those

52:24.208 --> 52:29.144
whom we have lost,
to found a better life.

52:29.146 --> 52:33.148
For who is God,
except the lord,

52:33.150 --> 52:36.251
and who is a rock
besides our God?

52:36.253 --> 52:38.153
The god who girdles
me with strength

52:38.155 --> 52:41.256
and made my way safe.

52:41.258 --> 52:44.293
He made my feet like
the feet of a deer

52:44.295 --> 52:47.329
and set me secure
on the heights.

52:47.331 --> 52:50.232
He trains my hands for war

52:50.234 --> 52:53.802
so that my arms can
bend a bow of bronze,

52:53.804 --> 52:56.839
you have given me the
shield of your salvation

52:56.841 --> 52:59.508
and your right hand
has supported me.

52:59.510 --> 53:04.279
Your help has made me great,
you gave me a wide place

53:04.281 --> 53:08.851
for my steps under me
and my feet did not slip.

53:08.853 --> 53:12.221
I pursued my enemies
and overtook them,

53:12.223 --> 53:16.191
and did not turn back
until they were consumed.

53:16.193 --> 53:19.828
I struck them down so that
they were not able to rise,

53:19.830 --> 53:22.297
they fell under my feet

53:22.299 --> 53:25.200
for you girdled me with
strength for the battle.

53:25.202 --> 53:28.971
You made my assailants
sink under me,

53:28.973 --> 53:31.273
you made my enemies
turn their backs to me

53:31.275 --> 53:38.347
and those who hated me,
I destroyed.

54:10.346 --> 54:11.980
<i>Hey, you've got
Jim and Rosie.</i>

54:11.982 --> 54:13.282
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

54:13.284 --> 54:16.251
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

54:16.253 --> 54:17.986
<i>Hey Jim, it's Sean.</i>

54:17.988 --> 54:20.255
<i>Uh, you're not answering
your cell,</i>

54:20.257 --> 54:22.291
<i>are you all right?</i>

54:22.293 --> 54:24.259
<i>I don't really know
what to say but uh,</i>

54:24.261 --> 54:26.528
<i>I'm just thinking of you bro.</i>

54:26.530 --> 54:28.864
<i>I hope you're okay,
I love you.</i>

54:28.866 --> 54:32.467
<i>Please call.</i>

54:41.277 --> 54:42.578
<i>Hey, you've got Jim and Rosie.</i>

54:42.580 --> 54:44.279
<i>We're not home right now
but leave a message</i>

54:44.281 --> 54:46.949
<i>and we'll call you right back.</i>

54:46.951 --> 54:49.318
<i>Hey Jim, it's Fred
and Frank.</i>

54:49.320 --> 54:52.554
<i>Listen bud, we'd love to get
together for lunch sometime.</i>

54:52.556 --> 54:55.357
<i>We'll come over some
night, watch the game,</i>

54:55.359 --> 54:57.492
<i>do some serious drinking.</i>

54:57.494 --> 55:01.563
<i>We miss you, pal.</i>

55:52.616 --> 55:54.950
Well done, well done!

55:54.952 --> 55:57.085
Thank you to my
lovely secretary

55:57.087 --> 55:58.353
who's been working so hard.

56:06.363 --> 56:08.430
I think after last week...

56:12.403 --> 56:15.671
<i>Mr. Marwood is
extremely busy!</i>

56:18.375 --> 56:20.375
It's lovely!

56:37.161 --> 56:38.160
Well maybe it's time
for some of us

56:38.162 --> 56:42.597
to stumble home.

56:42.599 --> 56:44.533
Have a good weekend guys,
you deserve it!

56:46.470 --> 56:47.402
Hello?

56:47.404 --> 56:48.704
John, what?

56:48.706 --> 56:50.706
Come on John, it's too late
for that stuff.

56:50.708 --> 56:53.008
No, I really don't wanna
talk about this right now,

56:53.010 --> 56:55.477
can you just please call me
tomorrow morning?

56:55.479 --> 56:58.413
All right, all right thank
you.

56:59.516 --> 57:01.083
Mr. Marwood, I'm Jim Baxford.

57:01.085 --> 57:02.551
Yeah.

57:02.553 --> 57:05.554
I left you a bunch of messages,
20 to be exact.

57:05.556 --> 57:09.591
I, uh... I'm off the clock
you know, if you wanna talk...

57:09.593 --> 57:12.494
I lost my life savings.

57:12.496 --> 57:15.430
My house, my job, my wife...

57:15.432 --> 57:19.534
Look Jim, it is not my fault
your wife left you, all right?

57:19.536 --> 57:21.703
She didn't leave me,
she's dead.

57:21.705 --> 57:24.573
Oh for fuck... come on man.

57:24.575 --> 57:26.508
I'm telling you...

57:26.510 --> 57:30.212
Just get off of me!

57:49.466 --> 57:53.468

58:00.511 --> 58:03.678

58:27.504 --> 58:30.272
<i>This is amazing!</i>

58:30.274 --> 58:32.774
<i>How did you do that?</i>

58:32.776 --> 58:34.643
<i>You know it was really easy</i>

58:34.645 --> 58:38.113
<i>with the new mortgage
incentive rate...</i>

58:56.834 --> 59:00.135
<i>So it looks great, we
got rid of everything.</i>

59:00.137 --> 59:03.138
That's great, fantastic.

59:03.140 --> 59:05.140
And you think that's going
to be enough?

59:05.142 --> 59:06.575
<i>Absolutely, the bank
will look great</i>

59:06.577 --> 59:10.312
but our clients... not so much.

59:10.314 --> 59:12.681
Okay, it's the only
play we had...

59:12.683 --> 59:15.584
we took the shot and
it's looking good.

59:15.586 --> 59:17.285
Am I right?

59:17.287 --> 59:18.854
<i>Yeah, you were right
all along.</i>

59:18.856 --> 59:20.689
Okay, well you know...

59:20.691 --> 59:23.758

<i>They can destroy companies

<i>Like many other
financial institutions,</i>

59:57.728 --> 01:00:01.329

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.680
<i>I want to be very clear,</i>

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:24.386
<i>I take full responsibility
for the decisions that I made</i>

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:27.355
<i>and for the actions

<i>The loans came with virtually
no strings attached.</i>

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.765
<i>However, eventually the
bottom dropped out sharply</i>

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.634

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:45.807

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.660
<i>uh, we've sent you letters and
left you numerous messages</i>

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.263
<i>about your mortgage default.</i>

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:09.664
<i>As per our conversation
the other day,</i>

<i>the bank has no choice
at this time</i>

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:13.268

<i>I'm not answering

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:41.830
Mr. Baxford.

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.707
James Baxford.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.447
Are you James Baxford?

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:03.351
Notice of eviction
due to foreclosure.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:04.719
You like doing this,

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.322
kicking people out
on the street?

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:08.990
I'm sorry sir, but you're gonna
have to sign this document

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:10.725
and pack up your things.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.995
You will have 48 hours
to vacate the premises.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:15.997
Sir, if you and your belongings
are not out of here

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:18.833
in 48 hours, the sheriff will be
here to remove you forcibly,

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.870
so you should sign this.

01:02:24.473 --> 01:02:27.542
Take this piece of paper
and shove it up your ass.

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:32.314
That's fine Mr. Baxford, but
you've been legally served.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.967
And no loud music!

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.938
And that's not working,
take the stairs.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:49.017
Speaking of work,
how's Jim?

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:51.152
I don't know...

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:55.156
I'll give him a call,
see how he's doing.

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:57.225
He's been on my mind lately.

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:21.115
<i>Hey Jim, we've been thinking
about you!</i>

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:25.053
Here I'm gonna put you
on speaker, okay?

01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:27.188
Hey man, we miss you
at lunch.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.923
<i>Yeah, you should come
join us.</i>

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.726
I need more time guys,
a little more time.

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:33.928
Well you take all
the time you need,

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.563
we just want you to know
we're all there for you.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:36.931
Yeah, don't run away from us,

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.666
we're gonna help you
get back on your feet.

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:41.202
I really appreciate it guys,
I'll see you soon.

01:05:41.204 --> 01:05:42.270
All right.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.104
All right, man.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:46.241
Bye.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.043
These are the 2 pieces
you were asking about,

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:58.346
did you bring the dollars?

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:02.116
Looks good.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.618
So where'd you serve?

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.086

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:06.154

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:07.655
Stack's a good soldier.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:08.289
Yeah.

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:11.626
Don't forget your clips.

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:13.094
Hey, I gotta ask you...

01:07:13.096 --> 01:07:14.295
Are you in any way,
shape or form

01:07:14.297 --> 01:07:16.097
associated with
law enforcement?

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.066
I ain't no cop, I'm
just a private citizen

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:20.168
concerned about his personal
safety, all right?

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:22.637
Yeah...

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:23.771
Grenades?

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:26.307
Oh yeah, I got 2 left,
shrapnel.

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:28.209
How much?

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:32.780
I'll sell you both for
a hunsky.

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.849
For personal protection?

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:36.250
For fun.

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:38.119
Grenades are fun!

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:41.389
You take it easy.

it's not good.

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:38.512
You know, it is what it is.

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:42.016
Anyway, so uh...
I'm moving.

thing sometimes.

No, I don't know why
the hell she won't go.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.238
It's a mystery to me!

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.439
She fucking loves you.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.541
Oh yeah, she loves me.

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:09.443

everybody in the neighbourhood,

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.479
She hasn't bailed
on him yet.

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:13.447
She loves me, right.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:17.451
Well you gotta tell us
where you're going, all right?

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:21.789
with all these fucking
shootings, huh?

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.492
Yeah, it's a hell of a thing.

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:27.495
The whole city's on alert,
look at that.

01:14:27.497 --> 01:14:29.730
Yeah, the brass is afraid
it's gonna escalate.

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:32.666
Really, they'll get him
soon enough.

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:35.069
They'd better, the brass
is screaming.

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:38.239
Whoever it is really fucking
hates rich bankers,

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:40.107
which only leaves
a million suspects.

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.475
You know whoever
catches this guy

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.477
is gonna get a big promotion,
my man.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.479
Well in that case,
I'll save you the trouble.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:49.650
What the fuck are you
talking about?

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:52.753
It's me.

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:58.225
Okay, you had me going for
a minute there, all right?

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:00.694
I'm serious.

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:07.301
You'll give me a heart attack,
what's wrong with you?

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:09.537
All right, who got the
Reuben?

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:10.638
Always with the fingers,
huh?

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.106
Sorry.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:14.642
Don't want that, I'm gonna get
an STD from this sandwich.

01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:18.245
You ruined it for me,
I'm serious.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:20.548
I'm afraid to eat this sandwich,
I'm gonna get a herpe.

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:21.649
You should put a condom
on your finger,

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:23.851
that's what you should do.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:27.822
I think she's been going to
the gym, you notice that?

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:36.624
My wife's ready to pop!

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:38.592
I got him a membership
to our country club,

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.594
it was like 90,000 plus.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:41.929
That is crazy.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.197
You're crazy.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:44.598
I owe you too much money.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.634
Hey, did you hear Stancroft...

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:04.712
Hey Robert!

01:18:04.714 --> 01:18:06.814
It's Jim, Jim Baxford.

01:18:06.816 --> 01:18:07.848
Jim Baxford!

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.783
Hey, it's good to see you.

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:14.355
from that little financial
disaster of ours.

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.690
Not quite, but
I'm getting there.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.993
Well it was a tough time man,
we all took a loss.

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:22.496
I mean, when I told my wife we
couldn't vacation in Barbados,

01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:25.299
she tore a strip off me
the size of Long Island.

01:18:25.301 --> 01:18:27.801
But things get better,
right?

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.870
Right, that's what everyone
keeps telling me.

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:32.039
Trust me, it's true.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:36.710
Look, um... let me give
you my new business card,

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.747
There we go, I've got a couple
of uh, investment ideas

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:41.448
you might be interested in.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.517
I'll take you for lunch
next week, huh?

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:46.720
I gotta run, it was good
to see you.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:47.454
Hey you too.

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:49.590
Yeah, call me.

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:03.737
<i>Next caller,
go ahead please.</i>

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.806
<i>I'm glad those bankers
got shot.</i>

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:08.776
<i>There's no effective laws
in this country anymore,</i>

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:11.345
<i>you get 5 years for
robbing a gas station,</i>

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:13.514
<i>you destroy America...</i>

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:15.516
<i>you get 20 trillion
dollars and you walk away?</i>

01:19:15.518 --> 01:19:17.751
<i>Violence is not
the solution, Gus.</i>

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.754
<i>Isn't violence the official
solution of our government
in Iraq,</i>

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:21.555
<i>Afghanistan?</i>

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:24.758
Thanks for your comments,
Gus.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.826
<i>Next caller, who's on the
line?</i>

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:27.494
<i>Why'd you cut Gus off?</i>

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:30.898
<i>I lost my house and Wall Street
is getting a free ride...</i>

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.370
<i>Okay, that's all
the time we have</i>

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:37.771
<i>on today's show for
call ins.</i>

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.773
<i>Let's look at today's market,</i>

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.843
<i>the US dollar is trading
at 1.31 against...</i>

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:12.005
Robert here.

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.807
Robert, it's Jim.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:14.942
Jim, how you doing?

01:20:14.944 --> 01:20:18.879
but I won 50 G in
a poker tournament.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:20.981
Fucking unbelievable.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.951
Anyway, I need some
advice on what to put it in.

01:20:23.953 --> 01:20:26.887
Oh great, well how
about we have a coffee?

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:27.921
<i>The place near my office?</i>

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:28.956
Yeah, same coffee shop.

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:30.424
<i>Okay.</i>

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:30.958
See you tomorrow, 9 o'clock.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.825
<i>Sounds great.</i>

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.161
All right, see you then.

01:25:41.235 --> 01:25:43.136
Yeah but you see,
you see uh...

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:45.138
8-5-6, that's gotta jump
up to 9-2-5.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.175
No, no... look at the, look
at the right screen.

01:25:48.177 --> 01:25:51.144
No, we gotta sell those shares
right away.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:54.881
drop off the other side, we
need more points on that side.

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:56.950
Shit... I'm not
the boss here...

01:25:56.952 --> 01:26:01.021
You have absolutely no say
in this.

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:09.296
Please, my wife...
she's pregnant.

01:26:13.235 --> 01:26:16.837
Maggie, get a hold of
security now!

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:18.238
Hey, what the fuck
is going on?

01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:24.945
Get back to your wife and be
thankful, you prick.

01:26:24.947 --> 01:26:26.313
Get the fuck outta here!

01:26:26.315 --> 01:26:28.348
Go!

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:45.398
Hurry, hurry run!

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400
Go!

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.051
Copy that, 38th floor!

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:47.120
38th floor!

01:28:56.931 --> 01:28:59.366
Police are looking into whether
or not today's shooting spree

01:28:59.368 --> 01:29:02.002
has anything to do
with the recent murders.

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:04.938
Now from what we know, all
of the victims were involved

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.374
in the brokerage scandal
but there was a question

01:29:07.376 --> 01:29:10.343
whether or not the fraud
charges could be prosecuted.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:13.413
We know that the shooter
is still in the building
at the moment.

01:29:19.988 --> 01:29:24.357
Get outta here.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.092
Out!

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:29.229
Get out!

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:39.706
Whatever it is you want,
this is not the way to get it.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:45.478
Take a fucking seat,
right there.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.548
Sit the fuck down.

01:29:53.187 --> 01:29:56.990
Bet you've never seen your
desk from that angle before.

01:29:56.992 --> 01:30:02.495
I don't know who you
think it is I am but...

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:04.664
this isn't gonna
accomplish anything.

01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:07.434
Did I tell you to speak?

01:30:07.436 --> 01:30:08.501
You wanna know the difference

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:10.437
between a banker
and a gangster?

01:30:10.439 --> 01:30:15.475
A gangster always
has a getaway plan.

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:17.544
Okay...

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:26.519
And by the way... I
know exactly who you are.

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:28.521
You are the guy who fucks
everyday people in the ass

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:32.559
when you're not sitting in your
fucking house in the Hamptons,

01:30:32.561 --> 01:30:34.494
or booking tennis lessons
from your penthouse

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:37.530
overlooking Central Park.

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.432
How do you know all this?

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:42.502
I've been watching you.

01:30:44.538 --> 01:30:45.772
The problem with guys like you

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:47.440
is you can't stop bragging.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:51.745
you're making sure that every
magazine in the country

01:30:51.747 --> 01:30:54.714
knows all about
your triumphs.

01:30:54.716 --> 01:30:58.251
Well, you know there are people
that derive inspiration

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:00.053
from success stories.

01:31:00.055 --> 01:31:01.588
You know maybe you'd do all
the same things I've done

01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:02.722
given the opportunity.

01:31:02.724 --> 01:31:04.257
No, I wouldn't.

01:31:04.259 --> 01:31:05.759
I wouldn't sell bad
loans to people

01:31:05.761 --> 01:31:09.462
with small amounts of money.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:10.497
You make yourself
real cash based

01:31:10.499 --> 01:31:14.501
on fabricated
nonexistent loans.

01:31:14.503 --> 01:31:16.803
You cook the books to
get your bonuses,

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.605
that's what you fucks do.

01:31:18.607 --> 01:31:22.575
But the question is,
why should I let you live?

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:28.214
You're a salesman, right?

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.482
Sell me.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:32.218
Sell you...

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.486
You know that there's
not a person on this earth

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:36.523
that's worth over a
hundred million dollars

01:31:36.525 --> 01:31:39.526
that came by
that money honestly?

01:31:39.528 --> 01:31:43.263
The Vanderbilts, the Carnegies,
the Gettys,

01:31:43.265 --> 01:31:47.100
the Morgans, the Hursts,
the Rockafellers...

01:31:47.102 --> 01:31:51.504
They just annexed territories
and licenses and businesses

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:52.839
and killed the native
population

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:55.108
and imported slaves
and sold guns

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:57.510
to both the north and the
south during the Civil War

01:31:57.512 --> 01:32:04.584
and they're heroes,
they're American heroes!

01:32:04.586 --> 01:32:07.720
Take 5 on 38.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:11.791
Coming down, proceeding
to locate target.

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:16.863
We teach our children, what...
honesty and hard work

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:18.598
are the keys to success?

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.867
My children... my children are
not gonna go off to some war,

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:23.269
they're gonna go to Yale,
they're gonna go to Harvard.

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:26.139
And it's gonna be the dumb,
stupid, white trash kids

01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:28.575
and the black ghetto kids
that are gonna fight

01:32:28.577 --> 01:32:31.544
America's senseless wars
and they're gonna protect

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:34.681
American security and business,
and it's gonna be my business.

01:32:34.683 --> 01:32:38.618
richer and richer and
my bonuses are gonna
get bigger and bigger,

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:42.689
and it's the same old story.
It's the bankers and the owners

01:32:42.691 --> 01:32:44.691
and the advisors that get rich!

01:32:44.693 --> 01:32:46.726
And it's the little people,
who buy their stock

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:49.662
and always lose in the end.

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:55.301
To people like you!

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:58.571
Some people don't recover,
people like me.

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:01.374
It's a free trade system,
my friend.

01:33:01.376 --> 01:33:02.909
That's capitalism.

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:06.246
That's competition in
a capitalist society,

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:10.383
that's how the cream
always rises to the top.

01:33:10.385 --> 01:33:15.455
That's how the strong survive
and the weak die off.

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:27.634
Like her?

01:33:27.636 --> 01:33:28.601
That's my wife
you're looking at,

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:30.737
she's dead because of you.

01:33:30.739 --> 01:33:32.705
Come on... I don't give a fuck,

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:35.875
I have never seen you before
in my life.

01:33:35.877 --> 01:33:38.211
But you do know about the real
estate growth superfund,

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:40.647
That's where you put
your money.

01:33:40.649 --> 01:33:44.617
For the commissions,
for the commissions.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.819
That's how it works.

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:51.357
You like competition?

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:52.625
I love competition.

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:54.627
You wanna play a little
free market competition,

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:55.828
just you and me?

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:57.397
You and me?

01:33:57.399 --> 01:34:00.466
I can't wait.

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:05.638
One weapon, two guys.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.308
Winner lives...

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:21.454
On the count of 3...

01:34:21.456 --> 01:34:25.525
1... 2...

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:29.662
Well, lookie here!

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:30.863
I came out on top.

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:32.765
That's what you
don't understand,

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:35.668
What's important is that I won,

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:39.739
doesn't matter how I won,
and you're dead.

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:43.409
I cheated too.
