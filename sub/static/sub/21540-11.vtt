00:02.435 --> 00:03.503
<i>- Previously on "Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York"...</i>

00:04.938 --> 00:06.306
- Just get it sold.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.541
<i>- This building is actually</i>
<i>really hard to sell.</i>

00:08.575 --> 00:10.477
I think we should take
the penthouse deal

00:10.510 --> 00:13.413
and then we'll make it back
on the other two.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.549
- Yes.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho thank God.

00:16.583 --> 00:19.352
- The only thing left is to try
with a different egg donor.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.854
- I never thought
I was gonna say it,

00:20.887 --> 00:22.889
but I think I'm done.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.791
- I'm stressed.
- I can tell.

00:24.824 --> 00:25.992
- I think I need a partner.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.396
Why don't we work
on one deal together?

00:29.429 --> 00:30.630
- Let's do it.

00:30.663 --> 00:31.831
- Ah.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.501
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:36.503
<i>- I'm the top dog</i>
<i>in real estate.</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:38.238
<i>I fetch deals all day long,</i>

00:38.271 --> 00:40.440
<i>but then I come home</i>
<i>for a treat.</i>

00:40.473 --> 00:43.076
<i>- The most important thing</i>
<i>to me is moving forward.</i>

00:43.109 --> 00:45.345
<i>I'm all about the journey,</i>
<i>not the trophy.</i>

00:45.378 --> 00:48.114
<i>- I've conquered New York,</i>
<i>but I'm not stopping there.</i>

00:48.148 --> 00:50.517
<i>No boundaries, no limits,</i>
<i>no problem.</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:52.252
I didn't steal your clients,
they came to me.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.154
- I worked really damn hard
to get here.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.222
I'm not gonna have
somebody like you steal from me.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.224
- You're not gonna disrespect me
ever again.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.760
<i>* *</i>

01:01.761 --> 01:06.066
<i>* *</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:09.469
- Alberto,
could you take me to Seaport?

01:09.502 --> 01:13.440
<i>Seaport is</i>
<i>the oldest neighborhood.</i>

01:13.473 --> 01:16.076
This is where Manhattan started
because it was the port.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.112
<i>The ships came in the harbor,</i>
<i>all of that stuff.</i>

01:19.145 --> 01:21.614
<i>Now it's exploding.</i>

01:21.648 --> 01:23.183
I'm nervous.
I never ever get nervous.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.551
This is such a big freaking
sellout.

01:26.653 --> 01:27.921
- What?
Nostrils, what?

01:27.954 --> 01:30.290
The tower at 1 Seaport is

01:30.323 --> 01:32.859
the most anticipated
new development

01:32.892 --> 01:34.394
<i>in construction right now.</i>

01:34.427 --> 01:36.529
<i>Today I'm meeting</i>
<i>with the developer Jonathan.</i>

01:36.563 --> 01:38.932
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I cannot stop pitching him,</i>

01:38.965 --> 01:41.267
and yet, he won't give me
the building.

01:41.301 --> 01:42.669
<i>It's now or never.</i>

01:42.702 --> 01:43.937
[sighs]
Big breath.

01:43.970 --> 01:47.140
This could be the biggest
sellout of my career.

01:47.173 --> 01:48.842
Hey.
- How are you?

01:48.875 --> 01:51.111
- I apologize for harassing you.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.879
I have called you,
I've texted you.

01:52.912 --> 01:55.315
I took you out for two lunches,
you declined the third one.

01:55.348 --> 01:56.916
The dinner you
didn't even respond to me.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.151
Do you understand
what this means to me?

01:58.184 --> 01:59.652
I'm getting goosey-goosey
talking to you.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.755
I'm obsessed.
- I'm obsessed too,

02:01.788 --> 02:03.256
but, here's the thing,
Fredrik.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.492
You're a great salesman...
- Mm-hmm.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.727
- But you haven't
sold me yet.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.063
What is the strategy?
What's your game plan?

02:10.096 --> 02:11.464
- I need to go international.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.667
I'm thinking Asia
and I'm thinking London.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.069
I'll go every--
anywhere you want.

02:16.102 --> 02:19.906
New development, today
the competition is so fierce,

02:19.939 --> 02:22.742
so I need to prove to him that
I'll go all over the world.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.244
Jonathan, I don't know
what else to tell you.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.478
Internationals love New York.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.680
Everybody wants to invest
in New York.

02:26.713 --> 02:27.781
I'll go international.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.382
You can't just
cold call people.

02:29.416 --> 02:32.152
You need to meet in person.
What broker does that?

02:32.185 --> 02:34.087
I mean, when people say
"I'm gonna go international"

02:34.087 --> 02:36.790
it usually means
the broker sends an email blast

02:36.823 --> 02:38.091
and waits for the phone to ring.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.226
I don't--Jonathan,
you know I cannot sleep

02:40.260 --> 02:41.594
without this building.
This is everything to me.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.730
My whole life has been
leading up to this very moment

02:43.763 --> 02:45.365
standing here in front of you
trying to convince you

02:45.398 --> 02:46.466
that I am the right guy.
- Fredrik--

02:46.499 --> 02:47.734
- I cannot sleep.
I cannot eat.

02:47.767 --> 02:48.935
- Stop, Fredrik, stop.
- No, listen to me.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.304
Listen to me.
- You gotta shut the f--- up.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.808
You have the job, buddy.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.242
It's yours.
- Hmm?

02:56.276 --> 02:58.011
- All right,
we're gonna sell this thing.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.180
- Yes!
- 350 million bucks.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.048
- Boop, boop!

03:02.048 --> 03:03.550
Can you turn around
for a minute?

03:05.385 --> 03:06.653
[screaming]

03:06.686 --> 03:08.855
- All right, buddy, let's go.
It's time to work.

03:08.888 --> 03:12.792
<i>* *</i>

03:12.826 --> 03:15.829
This is the first
waterfront building

03:15.862 --> 03:18.365
in lower Manhattan.
- Wow.

03:18.398 --> 03:21.234
Look, our site right there.
- It's gonna be going up

03:21.267 --> 03:25.205
over the next year.
- If you like skyscrapers,

03:25.238 --> 03:27.340
<i>there's never really been any</i>
<i>right on the water.</i>

03:27.374 --> 03:30.076
<i>Not residential.</i>
<i>They're always set back,</i>

03:30.076 --> 03:31.745
<i>like, a few blocks.</i>

03:31.778 --> 03:33.279
- Terraces
on the waterfront.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.515
<i>Terraces on--</i>
<i>- Every unit has terrace?</i>

03:35.548 --> 03:37.150
<i>- Every unit has outdoor space</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

03:37.183 --> 03:38.485
- What?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.220
I've never done a building
where every apartment

03:40.253 --> 03:42.088
<i>has private,</i>
<i>outdoor space.</i>

03:42.122 --> 03:45.392
It's usually, like, 15-20%
of the building--the most.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.394
And people can come
into the sales gallery here

03:47.427 --> 03:49.562
and imagine their view
'cause this is the real view.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.498
- Yeah, this is the view.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.667
<i>This is a glass model</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

03:53.700 --> 03:57.404
<i>- Wow, we have one, two, three,</i>
<i>four bedrooms.</i>

03:57.437 --> 04:01.041
<i>Half floors, full floors,</i>
<i>duplexes, penthouses.</i>

04:01.041 --> 04:02.542
- So then we have
the--the crown jewels,

04:02.575 --> 04:04.678
which are the, uh, penthouses.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.914
Two penthouse units on top.
24-foot ceiling heights.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.582
<i>Waterfront</i>
<i>- What--what, 24?</i>

04:09.616 --> 04:11.418
<i>- 24-foot ceiling height.</i>

04:11.451 --> 04:12.652
<i>- Don't even get me started.</i>

04:12.686 --> 04:14.554
<i>I'm gonna have</i>
<i>a real estate orgasm.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:16.690
It is major, it's massive,
it's never been done before.

04:16.723 --> 04:19.159
I'm gonna sell it.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.427
That's a hole in the ground.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.696
That's gonna take
18 to 24 months to complete.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.197
<i>- That's correct.</i>
<i>- So I need this environment</i>

04:24.230 --> 04:25.965
<i>to be able to sell.</i>
<i>When is the sales gallery--</i>

04:26.066 --> 04:27.600
<i>this environment right here,</i>
<i>gonna be done?</i>

04:27.634 --> 04:28.902
- In eight weeks.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.638
You go to internationally before
this sales center is open,

04:31.671 --> 04:34.207
25% sell through,
and come back here

04:34.240 --> 04:36.476
and launch your grand opening
in New York City.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.478
- Wait, you're saying you want
me to go now

04:38.511 --> 04:40.547
before this is done?
- I'm not waiting.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.982
I need to sell
these units now.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.984
- That's 20 units.
- Yes.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.320
We'll see if we can get you
a smaller model.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.089
<i>- I wanted to go</i>
<i>when I had momentum.</i>

04:49.089 --> 04:50.757
When I already had sales
backing me up.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.760
I mean, going now,
I don't even have a brochure.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.362
I'm gonna have
a little travel model?

04:55.395 --> 04:58.565
- There's no excuses.
Execution time, my friend.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.867
<i>- Okay, I'll start packing.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

05:00.900 --> 05:08.908
<i>* *</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:13.446
- Hell's Kitchen didn't used
to be so awesome.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.049
It was known for things like...

05:16.049 --> 05:19.886
murder,
but now it's known for dance.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.688
<i>You've got places</i>
<i>like Alvin Ailey.</i>

05:21.721 --> 05:23.289
<i>It's known for Restaurant Row,</i>

05:23.323 --> 05:25.125
<i>and it's known for theater</i>
<i>and Broadway.</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:26.893
It's where culture lies.

05:26.926 --> 05:29.262
It's a big one.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.730
- Hey, Victor.
- Ryan.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.098
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.566
Thanks for having me.
- It's a brand-new development,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.368
as you know.
We've got 55 units.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.470
We've sold, uh, 70%.
- Got it.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.072
- Um, so we've got
16 units left,

05:39.072 --> 05:41.141
so I wanna show you some of
the units that we've got.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.076
<i>* *</i>

05:43.109 --> 05:45.912
So this is, uh, Garden "A."
- Cool.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.213
<i>* *</i>

05:47.247 --> 05:48.248
<i>They're fully staged.</i>

05:48.281 --> 05:50.216
So every unit is
completely built out?

05:50.250 --> 05:52.152
<i>- That's right.</i>
<i>- Cool, let's go outside.</i>

05:52.185 --> 05:54.087
- So this is
the outdoor space here.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.089
- Whoa.
In the middle of Hell's Kitchen?

05:56.089 --> 05:57.424
- In the middle
of Hell's Kitchen, that's right.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.092
<i>- Crazy.</i>
<i>Can I see the other units?</i>

05:59.092 --> 06:00.794
- Yeah, let's do it.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.462
So this is the two bedroom.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.364
- Okay.
Are there any units that have,

06:04.397 --> 06:06.399
like, bigger kitchens
or bigger bathrooms?

06:06.433 --> 06:08.034
- No, it's the same size
all the way through.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.235
- Got it.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.438
<i>The apartments are small</i>
<i>individually,</i>

06:11.471 --> 06:12.839
<i>which could be a problem,</i>

06:12.872 --> 06:15.508
<i>but the job I'm being given</i>
<i>is huge.</i>

06:15.542 --> 06:17.043
There are 16 of them.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.712
So really the big difference
is either

06:18.745 --> 06:20.413
you have outdoor space
or you don't

06:20.447 --> 06:21.915
and bedroom count.
- Exactly.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.917
- Let's keep seeing the others.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.485
- What we've got left is
a great one bedroom

06:25.518 --> 06:28.355
with great, great light.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.123
- And what's the asking price
on this one?

06:30.156 --> 06:33.460
- $1,055,000.

06:33.493 --> 06:36.229
- Got it.
This is an expensive city.

06:36.262 --> 06:40.166
<i>This apartment is</i>
<i>just over 600 square feet,</i>

06:40.200 --> 06:43.403
<i>and I'm going to sell it</i>
<i>for over a million dollars.</i>

06:43.436 --> 06:44.938
I mean, that's, like,

06:44.971 --> 06:47.407
acres upon acres
in other states.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.342
That's mansions in other states,

06:49.376 --> 06:52.712
but people pay
to be in New York City.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.514
What's the total
sell out for those 16?

06:54.547 --> 06:56.383
- 23 million.
- Perfect.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.385
That's a good number for me.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.021
- Uh, it's not yours yet.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.555
- Got it.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.058
<i>* *</i>

07:05.091 --> 07:08.428
So, in a year,
you've gotten to 70% sold,

07:08.461 --> 07:10.030
and now you've
just kind of slowed down.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.599
- That's right.
- Yup. Okay.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.335
<i>When the building launches,</i>
<i>sales can be super swift,</i>

07:15.368 --> 07:17.337
but then things taper off

07:17.370 --> 07:18.872
<i>and then developers</i>
<i>don't know why.</i>

07:18.905 --> 07:21.541
The reason is is that the
strategy has stayed the same.

07:21.574 --> 07:24.344
It worked for a little bit,
but now you got to change it up.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.946
- Why do you think, uh,
we've got those remaining

07:27.047 --> 07:28.348
units still on the market?

07:28.381 --> 07:30.750
- I mean,
the number one reason is

07:30.784 --> 07:33.386
because you haven't
hired me yet.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.688
That's one.

07:34.721 --> 07:38.725
Uh, number two
is the staging is nice,

07:38.758 --> 07:43.263
but it's staged the way
kinda anyone would stage.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.565
The more successful I become,
the more I realize

07:45.598 --> 07:48.702
that sellers like it
when you're just real with them.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.103
You just tell them
how it is.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.138
I mean, you can't just
put a couch in the living room

07:52.172 --> 07:54.674
<i>and put a bed in a bedroom and</i>
<i>say, "Oh, God, we staged it"</i>

07:54.708 --> 07:56.443
because there's
no story told there.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.677
We're in Hell's Kitchen,

07:57.711 --> 08:01.147
this is the cultural center
of New York City,

08:01.181 --> 08:03.817
so we need to make
the apartments less vanilla.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.619
- Well, let me stop you
right there.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.455
I put a lot of money
into this building already,

08:08.488 --> 08:12.759
that's gonna be on you if you
wanna spend the time restaging.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.361
- Got it.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.296
So you built it

08:16.329 --> 08:18.732
and I will take care
of everything else.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.401
<i>When the sellout is</i>
<i>$23 million,</i>

08:21.434 --> 08:25.038
I'm not gonna really argue
about spending

08:25.071 --> 08:28.241
a couple thousand dollars
to stage.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.111
- How long can you
sell this project out?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.613
- Timeframe?
There's 16 units.

08:33.646 --> 08:35.582
Less than 90 days.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.952
- I was thinking
more like 60 days.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.720
- Deal.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.455
- All right, Ryan,
let's do it.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.757
You sell this one,
we can talk some more.

08:43.790 --> 08:44.758
- Okay, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.526
What did I just agree to?

08:46.559 --> 08:51.064
Did I just say that I would
sell 16 units in 60 days?

08:51.064 --> 08:54.134
Um, I'm a little stressed out,
but it's okay.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.202
I like adrenalin,
so let's do it.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.138
- 60 days, Ryan.
Don't let me down.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.439
- And then, are there linens

08:59.472 --> 09:01.174
on any of the beds
in the staged units?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.442
'Cause I might have
to sleep here.

I love it.

- I'm overwhelmed, Roni.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.599
- I can tell.
- I feel like

09:26.633 --> 09:28.168
I'm missing something,

09:28.201 --> 09:30.036

09:30.036 --> 09:31.404
<i>Now I have approached</i>

- Michael.
<i>- Michael Graves.</i>

09:34.541 --> 09:37.310
To consider the possibility
of partnering up.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.946
This can make our business
twice as big.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.481
- Let's do it.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.417
<i>- We decided</i>
<i>to start with one listing</i>

09:44.451 --> 09:47.721

09:47.754 --> 09:48.955

<i>Michael has decided to price it</i>

<i>much higher</i>
<i>than I normally would like...</i>

09:57.931 --> 09:59.199
8.75 million.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.967
There's so many options
out there

10:01.001 --> 10:02.035
that will probably give you

10:02.068 --> 10:03.536
a little bit more space...
- Right.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.071
- And the fact that we're
on the street level.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.473
<i>But we're working together.</i>

10:06.506 --> 10:08.174
<i>We have incorporated</i>
<i>amazing art</i>

10:08.208 --> 10:09.476
<i>from a local photographer,</i>

<i>is looking amazing.</i>

10:11.411 --> 10:12.412
with S's...

10:14.881 --> 10:17.584
- I want to gift a piece
to whoever buys this

10:17.617 --> 10:19.319
<i>or any broker</i>
<i>that brings a buyer...</i>

10:19.352 --> 10:21.221

- To pick one.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.423
A gift from me--
You can join me in that

10:23.456 --> 10:24.824

- Oh, come on.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.192
- You want to join me in that?
- It's not team playing.

<i>I'm not a cheap f---.</i>
<i>If somebody buys it,</i>

- Good to see you.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.706
We have invited very experienced

10:39.739 --> 10:41.041
Thank you for coming.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.544
But not only that,
that could understand

10:44.577 --> 10:46.579
the real value
behind this building

10:46.613 --> 10:48.548

it's one of a kind.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.083
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

10:50.116 --> 10:53.486
Now, this is Mansion 1,
It's about 2,500 square feet.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.188
- Of all the years I've been
selling real estate,

10:55.221 --> 10:56.523
I've never had a place

10:56.556 --> 10:58.892
that you can walk directly
in flat from the street.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.493
- You have three bedrooms
up here.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.295
You have two full bathrooms
upstairs.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.496
- It's gorgeous.
- It's beautiful.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.231
- Gorgeous.
- It is done to the nines.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.167
<i>- It's very good</i>
<i>to have a partner</i>

11:07.200 --> 11:09.569

take buyers one direction...

11:09.602 --> 11:10.670
Let me show you around.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.072
And he can take some
in a different.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.473
- Should we go upstairs
and take a look?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.309
- And we can keep the momentum
flowing.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.078

I love the vaulted ceilings.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.820

11:26.853 --> 11:29.089

11:29.089 --> 11:32.325

Traffic going by.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.228

there are in all of downtown.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.131

12:11.164 --> 12:14.501
- I started in 2008.
- Right.

<i>- Because of the fact that</i>

12:16.870 --> 12:18.171
these brokers think that

12:18.204 --> 12:21.141
I started doing real
estate yesterday, but no, papa.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.776
<i>Okay? I've been</i>

12:22.809 --> 12:26.079
- There's a lot of new
developments coming up, and--

12:26.079 --> 12:27.781
- But no new development
like this one.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.884
- Okay, what does that come out
to price per square foot.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.153
- It comes to north of $3,000
per square foot and change.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.888
- And how did you do
the comps for this?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.289
- Uh, there are no resales
in the building.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.825
In fact, there's 18 units.
The whole building is sold out.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.127
So this one, being a mansion--
which is--

12:41.161 --> 12:42.295
- This is a three bed.
Right.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.530
- It is a three bed.
- It's a home.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.265
It has two entrances--
- It's three entrances.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.534
One from here, one from there,
and one from the second floor.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.902
- Oh, the second floor also?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.103
- The second floor just in case
you wanted to land straight

12:50.136 --> 12:51.738
into your bedroom without
coming to the living room.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.107
No problem.
- That's very nice.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.743
You're very well versed,

to do a deal with you also.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.748

You know? You're way

internationally.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.834
I specifically mentioned
to Jonathan

16:40.867 --> 16:42.736
that we could go to London.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.972
but he wants to be
25% sold before we even launch

16:46.072 --> 16:48.074
in New York,
so I need to be 100% sure

16:48.074 --> 16:49.209
I pick the right city .

16:49.242 --> 16:52.212
But I want to be
very targeted here.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.080
I want to go with facts
and numbers.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.615
And I want to know
exactly where these

16:55.648 --> 16:57.817
really rich people are.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.387
Somebody with $30 million
or more.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.721
Those are the people
we want to get.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.456
I'm not gonna wait for them
to come to us,

17:03.490 --> 17:06.026
we're going to them.
- Well, there's a lot in Asia.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.128
- Huh? Asia?
- There's a lot in Asia right?

17:08.161 --> 17:09.529
- And Asians, the love New York.
- In Tokyo.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.730
Yes.
- They love towers, love glass

17:10.764 --> 17:12.532
they like water.
- But between Hong Kong,

17:12.565 --> 17:16.636
Singapore, and Tokyo,
you only have 9,492 people

17:16.670 --> 17:18.605
who have high net worth.
- What about Venezuela?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.640
According to this report,
it's actually doubling

17:20.674 --> 17:22.042
in people with $30 million
or more.

17:22.042 --> 17:23.276
That's, maybe,
where we should go.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.478
People with new wealth.
They want to buy in New York.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.647
- Venezuela's a great place,
but it's pretty impossible

17:27.681 --> 17:29.449
to get your money
out of Venezuela right now.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.851
So they're not really
able to buy in New York City.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.887
- Right,
Venezuela is out then. Okay.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.156
What about Monaco?
Monaco is the most ex--

17:36.189 --> 17:37.323
is more expensive than
New York and London.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.392
- It's so small.
There's just not enough

17:39.426 --> 17:42.362
buyers in Monaco.
- They only have 217..

17:42.395 --> 17:44.364
individual--
- 217 people with $30 million?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.066
- Yes.
- I love Monaco.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.767
- We should go to Italy.
- I think we should go to Seoul.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.269
- That's just because
you're Korean.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.437
- No. No.
- Tokyo.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.072
- Russia.
- Cape Town.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.239
- What?
- Cape Town.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.241
You get a lot more
for your money over there.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.476
There's a lot more space.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.812
- Maybe this wasn't
so good idea after all.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.814
- What do you think
about London?

18:00.847 --> 18:02.582
- Culturally,
the buyers in London

18:02.615 --> 18:05.218
totally understand
New York.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.721
- Also, of all the people
who own private jets,

18:07.754 --> 18:10.156
in London,
the number one place

18:10.190 --> 18:12.192
that they travel to first...
- Hmm?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.493
- Is New York.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.095
- What do you guys think
about London?

18:15.128 --> 18:17.664
- Yeah, I vote for London.
I think London is the best.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.032
- London is the best?
- It's the best.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.367
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.935
- This proves that I should
always listen to my guts.

18:22.035 --> 18:25.672
Okay, team,
this is amazing.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.540
We're going--
We're going to London!

18:27.574 --> 18:29.275
Whee!

18:29.309 --> 18:32.412
- Hmm, no.
Only you are going to London.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.180
We're still here.

18:34.214 --> 18:37.083
- I'll be packing and going
and you can help me. Right?

18:37.117 --> 18:39.419
It'll be just like
we were there.

18:41.054 --> 18:43.957
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

18:50.363 --> 18:51.765

- Yeah.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.233
- And then we'll go from there.
- Okay.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.669
- That--you're ridiculous.
Okay.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.871
The sales at my new building
in Hell's Kitchen

18:57.904 --> 18:59.272
have been stagnant
for a while.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.776
So now that I'm here,
I am going to breathe new life

19:02.809 --> 19:04.144
into this project.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.211
Just make sure
everything is good here.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.579
Make sure the drinks
are all setup.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.714
I'm gonna go change now.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.518
I have restaged
four of my 16 units

19:11.551 --> 19:14.020
to represent a different piece
of this neighborhood.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.690
<i>Hell's Kitchen</i>
<i>is the cultural hub</i>

19:27.534 --> 19:30.036
- I think I broke it.
Let's go check out the next one.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.771
Awesome.
- Oh, nice.

19:31.805 --> 19:34.207
- This isn't just
a decor gimmick.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.344
<i>A lot of people who live</i>
<i>in Hell's Kitchen are artists,</i>

19:37.377 --> 19:40.447

Follow me, everybody.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.085
<i>* *</i>

19:45.118 --> 19:47.053
<i>- Since I staged the units</i>

<i>- Coming up...</i>

20:10.076 --> 20:11.611
- How did Michael Graves
do at the open house?

20:11.644 --> 20:14.247
- I have been thinking
maybe...

20:20.286 --> 20:20.653
<i>[quirky music]</i>

20:23.223 --> 20:26.092

20:31.798 --> 20:33.700
- Wow.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.301
- I mean, I didn't necessarily
want to dress up

20:35.335 --> 20:36.836
like a female ballerina.

20:36.870 --> 20:40.006
Turns out, male ballerinas,
their outfits,

20:40.040 --> 20:42.008
way more inappropriate.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.911
Actually this is--I put my--
my phone's in there.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.781
[laughter]

20:47.814 --> 20:49.582
Where else was I gonna put it?

20:49.616 --> 20:52.118
So this apartment
is 640 square feet

20:52.152 --> 20:54.988
and we just put it on the market
for 1,055,000.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.524
There are a lot of people

and some of them actually live

20:59.592 --> 21:01.061

21:01.094 --> 21:03.830
All high-end appliances,
all custom cabinetry,

21:03.863 --> 21:05.131
there's tons of closet space,

21:05.165 --> 21:06.366
which is awesome
for a one bedroom,

21:06.399 --> 21:07.967
<i>and the bedroom is</i>
<i>really, really big.</i>

21:08.068 --> 21:09.402
So ask me
any questions you want.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.503
The building is great--

21:10.537 --> 21:12.872
- Would you be able
to do a pirouette?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.208
- Like this?
I mean, I did--

21:15.241 --> 21:16.576
[cheers and applause]

21:16.609 --> 21:17.911
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

<i>If you don't know,</i>
<i>it's on 46th Street,</i>

21:44.437 --> 21:46.940

<i>This apartment</i>

<i>to kind of get out of,</i>
<i>like, the Upper West Side,</i>

22:04.090 --> 22:05.792

about Hell's Kitchen,

22:09.529 --> 22:12.399
the west side,
it's all about theater.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.101
Tonight gives me the freedom

- Thanks.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.507
Thank you very much.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.641
- Is there a gym

22:21.675 --> 22:22.809
- Yeah, there's a gym that's...
- Yeah?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.310

He's really excited to see you.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.259
- [growls]
It's not backed up.

24:53.293 --> 24:56.363
- So, yeah, it's gonna be great.
Eh?

24:56.396 --> 24:58.598
- Uh, yes, babe.
- Yeah?

24:58.631 --> 25:01.534
- I want to see Kai, of course.
- Yeah?

25:01.568 --> 25:04.170
- I just have to get
this building off the ground.

25:04.204 --> 25:06.206
<i>Part of why I'm resistant's</i>

25:06.239 --> 25:09.275
because when we went through
our second miscarriage,

25:09.309 --> 25:11.511
just recently,
I made a promise to myself

25:11.544 --> 25:13.646
to not think

25:13.680 --> 25:16.416
or be exposed to any kind of

25:16.449 --> 25:18.118

25:18.151 --> 25:19.786
<i>It's just too damn difficult.</i>

on the work.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.156
I love you.
I-I gotta go.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.858

- Hello, Ronnie.

25:35.435 --> 25:38.071
Whatever kind of bullsh-- is
going on in my head right now,

25:38.071 --> 25:41.074
I have to put it on hold.
Okay?

25:41.107 --> 25:42.442
'Cause I gotta
sell this apartment,

25:42.475 --> 25:44.778

to call everybody...

- And everybody...

- And everybody...

25:48.748 --> 25:50.817
- That ever existed
in this world.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.720
- Uh, very good.
I just wanted to follow up

25:53.753 --> 25:56.356

25:56.389 --> 25:58.291
times this week that you think
you can bring your buyer

25:58.324 --> 25:59.759
I can accommodate.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.034
- You told me you did.
Were you lying to me?

26:15.108 --> 26:17.110
- Listen, you can't compare
this particular building

26:17.143 --> 26:18.812
to the rest
of what's around it

26:18.845 --> 26:20.714
because this is one of those
trophy buildings.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.352
- Okay, thank you.

26:26.486 --> 26:28.655
- Okay, uh...

26:28.688 --> 26:31.391
- How did Michael Graves do
at the open house?

26:31.424 --> 26:34.194
- You know what?
It was good, but, um...

26:35.195 --> 26:36.896
I have been thinking...

26:36.930 --> 26:40.600
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

26:40.633 --> 26:43.703
Maybe a partner
is not what I need.

26:43.737 --> 26:45.805
<i>* *</i>

26:45.839 --> 26:47.440
- What happened yesterday?

26:47.474 --> 26:49.376
- I felt very strange.

26:49.409 --> 26:52.445
We were having
a very successful open house...

26:52.479 --> 26:54.547
- Mm-hmm.
- Everybody showed up.

26:54.581 --> 26:58.451
There was a woman that has been
doing this for 25 years.

26:58.485 --> 27:00.353
You know, what 25 years is?

27:00.387 --> 27:01.654
I'm 29 years old.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.457
25 years ago
I was 4 years old.

27:04.491 --> 27:07.193
For some reason, it started
to have an affect on me

27:07.227 --> 27:08.595
at some point.
- Yeah, but, like, what's--

27:08.628 --> 27:09.796
what's wrong?
Why?

27:09.829 --> 27:12.565
I don't--
- I just felt--

27:12.599 --> 27:15.669
is this what our lives is
for the next 20 years?

27:15.702 --> 27:18.571
<i>I've always changed everything</i>
<i>all my life.</i>

27:18.605 --> 27:21.441
<i>I was passionate about being</i>
<i>a skateboarder and I went pro.</i>

27:21.474 --> 27:23.043
<i>Then I was passionate</i>
<i>about film directing.</i>

27:23.043 --> 27:24.210
<i>I did two films.</i>
<i>One of them was</i>

27:24.244 --> 27:25.879
a piece of sh--,
and that's where the transition

27:25.912 --> 27:27.614
into real estate,
and then I wanted to be

27:27.647 --> 27:28.848
a real estate agent.

27:28.882 --> 27:30.250
I don't know, it's, like, I'm--

at something...

27:37.824 --> 27:39.893

27:39.926 --> 27:42.762
Michael approached me
after he was selling

27:42.796 --> 27:44.064
and then he
started to tell me

27:44.097 --> 27:45.498
"We're going to get
a development here,

27:45.532 --> 27:47.267
we're going to get
a development there."

27:47.300 --> 27:50.236
But--I don't know,
it almost felt like...

27:50.270 --> 27:52.072
we're about to get married.
We're about to have kids.

27:52.072 --> 27:53.440
You're gonna meet my parents.

27:53.473 --> 27:57.077
And I'm like,
"Wow." Like--

27:57.110 --> 27:58.645
- I think
you're over thinking it.

27:58.678 --> 27:59.813
Maybe you just
had a bad day.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.181
You woke up,
you were tired.

28:01.214 --> 28:03.216
- I don't know.

28:05.185 --> 28:07.020
Was I really looking
for a partner

28:12.559 --> 28:14.894
- Deeper wound?
- Yeah.

28:14.928 --> 28:17.030
And what is
that deeper wound?

28:17.030 --> 28:20.266
<i>* *</i>

28:20.300 --> 28:23.269
What's wrong with me, Roni?
- Nothing's wrong with you.

28:23.303 --> 28:25.705
Everybody feels like this
once in a while.

28:25.739 --> 28:28.808
- Well...

28:28.842 --> 28:31.811
Maybe you're right,
but in the mean time,

28:31.845 --> 28:33.813
I don't think it's fair
for Michael to think

28:33.847 --> 28:35.648
that I'm going
to partner up with him,

28:35.682 --> 28:38.518
while I'm figuring out

28:38.551 --> 28:40.620
what the f---
is wrong with me.

28:40.653 --> 28:43.757
- Make sure you think it through

- Yeah.

<i>- Coming up...</i>

Hi. How are you?
- Hello, Fredrik,

good to see you.
<i>- A few years back,</i>

29:17.390 --> 29:20.126

So this is where--
this is where we're doing it?

29:21.761 --> 29:23.229
- Yeah, exactly.

everything needs to be perfect.

29:31.071 --> 29:32.305
Okay, so this is good.

Welcome!

29:34.341 --> 29:35.809
Hi, welcome.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.377
- Hi, Fredrik, how you doing?

Oh, my God, I've never shaken so
many British hands in my life.

29:40.213 --> 29:44.684
I knew they had 12,000 brokers
working for them worldwide,

29:44.718 --> 29:47.120
but I didn't know 12,000 was
coming to this presentation.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.121
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.723

So I just arrived in London.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.708
I thought we could
break the ice together

30:08.742 --> 30:10.310
by doing a little bit of
a high kick.

what a high kick is?

Anyway, thank you so much

<i>On these very people.</i>
<i>These brokers.</i>

I mean,
can I communicate to them

30:42.175 --> 30:44.844
so they can effectively
communicate to their buyers?

Seven offers.
That's awesome.

- Okay, so we have,
uh, let's start at 6G.

32:22.242 --> 32:25.779
Our offer is 1,025,000.

32:25.812 --> 32:29.549
- 6G we're asking...
1,050,000 on that?

32:29.582 --> 32:31.918
Yep, and then on 7G,

32:31.951 --> 32:34.821
1,040,000.

32:34.854 --> 32:37.991
- You're bringing me offers here
that, uh, are all below ask.

32:38.091 --> 32:40.427
I mean, that's not
why I brought you on board here.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.462
- I know there are some
buildings where I walk in

32:42.495 --> 32:44.764
and I present full-ask offers,

32:44.798 --> 32:46.566
<i>but that's</i>
<i>not gonna happen here.</i>

32:46.599 --> 32:49.369
<i>It's this big, overpriced,</i>

32:57.310 --> 33:00.180
2A is 1,374,000.

Those people were very,
very specific.

33:02.048 --> 33:06.820

2,150,000.

33:06.853 --> 33:08.888
That's seven offers!

33:08.922 --> 33:10.857
Phew.
That's pretty great.

33:10.890 --> 33:12.759
- Ryan, all these offers are
below ask.

33:12.792 --> 33:14.761
- That is a correct fact.

33:14.794 --> 33:17.731
- Everything in this building,
you know, has sold for...

33:17.764 --> 33:19.065
as--full ask.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.735
- I mean, everyone knows
that it's been on the market

33:21.768 --> 33:23.603
from before
I even came aboard.

33:23.636 --> 33:26.172
So people get nervous.

33:26.206 --> 33:27.540
If we get one A-line,

33:27.574 --> 33:29.442
then it helps me sell
the other A-lines

33:29.476 --> 33:31.478
and then slowly use it
as a domino effect.

33:31.511 --> 33:33.079
- There are a couple of those
offers that are close...

33:33.079 --> 33:34.280
- Mm-hmm.
- To ask.

33:34.314 --> 33:36.583
I mean, we can probably
work on some of those.

33:36.616 --> 33:38.485
but this is the first round,
I think you can get 'em higher.

33:38.518 --> 33:40.086
- But I already had
a first round with them.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.922
I mean, 2A started
at, like, 1.2,

33:42.956 --> 33:45.759
and so I've pulled them up
174,000.

33:45.792 --> 33:47.327
The market is giving us
what it's giving us,

33:47.360 --> 33:50.096
and then I'm squeezing these
things out of people.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.005
I'll--I'll take that offer.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.473
- One!
All right.

34:00.507 --> 34:02.409
Yes!
- On 2A,

34:02.442 --> 34:03.610
if you're saying those are
best and final

34:03.643 --> 34:05.278
from these guys...
- Yeah.

34:05.311 --> 34:08.581
- I'll take that 2A.
- All right, good work.

34:08.615 --> 34:10.116
6G and 7G.

34:10.150 --> 34:12.719
So, I mean, clo--closing out
the G line is

34:12.752 --> 34:14.854
would be the only reason.
- Is--G stands for "great."

34:14.888 --> 34:16.589
- I think I could
take those too.

34:16.623 --> 34:17.824
- Good.

34:17.857 --> 34:19.659
It's so nice
to sit with a developer

34:19.693 --> 34:20.860
who actually gets it.

34:20.894 --> 34:22.429
It's not just about
the individual unit.

34:22.462 --> 34:24.397
This is a project.
This is gonna be great.

34:24.431 --> 34:26.833
- But, uh, the problem is
you're other offers

34:26.866 --> 34:29.369
are ridiculous offers.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.071
The other three

34:31.071 --> 34:32.405
are just not gonna work...

34:32.439 --> 34:34.641
I know you're happy,
but that's not good.

34:34.674 --> 34:37.210
- No, I-I'm not happy
until we sell everything out.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.446
But everyone's just at--
they're lower numbers.

34:39.479 --> 34:41.548
Especially for the F
and the rest of the A-lines.

34:41.581 --> 34:43.616
- I expected
more from you, Ryan.

34:43.650 --> 34:47.187
And we're getting close to
the time that we talked about.

34:47.220 --> 34:49.122
- Sort of.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.390
- I think what
I'm gonna have to do is

34:50.423 --> 34:51.825
just keep
the rest of the units.

34:51.858 --> 34:53.293
I'm gonna rent 'em.

34:53.326 --> 34:55.528
- Are you kidding me?

34:55.562 --> 34:57.097
<i>You can't just stop.</i>

34:57.097 --> 34:58.264
We have the momentum now.

34:58.298 --> 34:59.466
Our agreement
isn't over yet.

34:59.499 --> 35:01.334
I mean, we still have
three weeks.

35:01.368 --> 35:03.670
We don't have to just,
like, pull the plug.

35:03.703 --> 35:05.405
We will--
I will get them sold.

35:05.438 --> 35:07.540
- But with offers like that,
Ryan, it's just...

35:07.574 --> 35:10.143
wasting time.
I'm paying the common charges

35:10.176 --> 35:12.045
and the taxes for those.
- Yeah.

35:12.045 --> 35:14.381
- So I've got to get
some positive cash flow.

35:14.414 --> 35:16.149
- But, you know,
if you rent all these out

35:16.182 --> 35:19.352
it's just gonna make selling
them harder down the line.

35:19.386 --> 35:22.389
With tenants in place
who've scratched up the floors,

35:22.422 --> 35:24.491
who threw up in the toilet,
you know,

35:24.524 --> 35:26.092
that's, like...
that's--

35:26.126 --> 35:27.494
Those are used units,

35:27.527 --> 35:30.964
so you don't want to at least
try to keep selling them?

35:31.064 --> 35:31.965
- I mean, I brought you on

35:32.065 --> 35:34.167
to sell the building out
at full ask,

35:34.200 --> 35:36.169

35:36.202 --> 35:38.071
I think your time's up.

35:38.071 --> 35:40.540
- Uh...
- So send me the contract

35:40.573 --> 35:42.509

and we'll execute those.

of course,
the lower priced units.

36:57.951 --> 36:59.786
That's gonna be easy.
What I really wanna do,

36:59.819 --> 37:03.056
what I'm aiming for, is to push
the more expensive top units.

37:03.089 --> 37:04.457
You know, after that
presentation I did,

37:04.491 --> 37:05.825
everybody wants the penthouse...
- Yes.

do, I structured it for you.

You're gonna put in
the full-ask offer

37:09.029 --> 37:11.031

37:11.031 --> 37:13.299
- It's not the top penthouse--
yeah, the penthouse.

to waste your breath here.

37:14.701 --> 37:16.269
- Is that accepted?
Is that an offer?

37:16.302 --> 37:18.171

no to selling you a one bedroom,

37:20.206 --> 37:21.474

37:21.508 --> 37:23.176

to get the penthouse.

37:23.209 --> 37:24.611

a whole floor.

Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

37:27.714 --> 37:31.151
Mmm. She says that
it's the penthouse or nothing.

37:31.184 --> 37:33.153

the penthouse.

If anything,
we raise the price by 5%.

this word...

Discount.

38:20.233 --> 38:22.435
- I don't think it's
an unreasonable discount.

Fredrik, can I have a discount

38:24.137 --> 38:25.805

38:27.273 --> 38:28.908
- 5%.
- No percents.

why he's reacting this way,

41:32.826 --> 41:35.795

- Yes?

- I need help, please.

41:47.907 --> 41:50.377
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

41:50.410 --> 41:52.946
- I don't like rentals.
- I know.

41:52.979 --> 41:54.514
- I hate them.

41:54.547 --> 41:57.017
I can't believe he's taking
the rest of the units

41:57.117 --> 41:58.985
at 432 and he's turning
them to rentals.

41:59.019 --> 42:00.353
- It's terrible.

42:00.387 --> 42:04.424
- I'm glad my assistants
are there for me emotionally,

42:04.457 --> 42:07.560
but I need Jordan to try
a little bit harder.

42:07.594 --> 42:10.397
I mean, I just lost
$400,000 in commission.

42:10.430 --> 42:12.966

it's worse than terrible,

42:13.066 --> 42:14.768

real pain.

42:14.801 --> 42:16.903
I need to save Victor
from himself.

42:16.936 --> 42:18.838
That's what I need to do.
- Okay.

42:18.872 --> 42:20.473
- There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a way

42:20.507 --> 42:22.776
that I can sell these things.

42:22.809 --> 42:25.178
- I don't know what that is,

42:25.211 --> 42:27.981
but let me
get back to you on that.

42:28.081 --> 42:30.917

42:36.389 --> 42:38.391
Okay. Okay.

42:38.425 --> 42:39.993
You know what? When I first
got into the business,

42:40.093 --> 42:41.861
and I was at my first building
on John Street

42:41.895 --> 42:43.129
in the Financial District...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

42:43.163 --> 42:45.932
- I had 442 units...

42:45.965 --> 42:48.435
and one thing that we did...

42:48.468 --> 42:50.370
is we found
international investors

42:50.403 --> 42:52.238
and we put the units together.

42:52.272 --> 42:54.307
We packaged them...

42:54.341 --> 42:56.176
to people that were looking
to do commercial deals.

42:56.209 --> 42:57.177
- Mm-hmm.

42:57.210 --> 42:59.312
- If they're all rented,

42:59.346 --> 43:02.248
than I've got an
income-producing bulk...

43:02.282 --> 43:04.718
and I can sell it
to one person.

43:04.751 --> 43:06.586
You know how, like,
you get excited 'cause you get

43:06.619 --> 43:07.921
to go to Costco
and instead of getting

43:07.954 --> 43:09.556
one box of Kleenex,
you're getting, like,

43:09.589 --> 43:12.625
20 boxes of Kleenex
and it's a little bit cheaper?

43:12.659 --> 43:14.728
Some people do that
with apartments.

43:14.761 --> 43:16.563
That's what I'll do
and then he'll take that deal.

43:16.596 --> 43:18.698
Maybe. If I get a good one.
- Hopefully.

43:18.732 --> 43:20.734
- The problem is,
when you're selling in bulk,

43:20.767 --> 43:23.636
the buyer's looking
for a massive discount.

43:23.670 --> 43:26.673
I think this might
be beneficial for Victor,

43:26.706 --> 43:28.875
because when you sell in bulk

43:28.908 --> 43:31.344
there are certain
tax advantages

43:31.378 --> 43:37.250
and then I can balance it out.

43:37.283 --> 43:39.886
It's a genius idea.
- I think so too.

43:39.919 --> 43:42.188
- Okay, you can leave now.
- Okay.

43:43.490 --> 43:45.558
<i>- Coming up...</i>
It's a bulk buyer.

43:45.592 --> 43:47.093
They want to feel
like they're getting a deal.

43:47.127 --> 43:49.129
- There's no way

It's not important to you.

- Uh, but, no--well,
I guess what I'm say--

44:05.812 --> 44:07.614
it is my perspective.
You're a young guy.

44:07.647 --> 44:10.450
You have a lot of time to,

- But I don't.

44:14.287 --> 44:16.122
- I need to close deals.
I need to close--

44:16.156 --> 44:17.290
and I've closed so many,
you know,

44:17.323 --> 44:19.726

broken records citywide

ranked seventh

basically the same time.
This is what you should have.

44:28.435 --> 44:30.236

44:37.377 --> 44:39.946
This gives more conviction
to my decision.

this need to be,

44:42.482 --> 44:44.217

at everything that I do,

44:44.250 --> 44:46.219
but I was seriously wondering
if that's something

44:46.252 --> 44:48.221
you would have.
I think that's the thing.

44:48.254 --> 44:49.856
- Listen, everybody has--
there's--

44:49.889 --> 44:51.091
I don't think there's
right or wrong.

44:51.091 --> 44:53.193
Everybody has
their own goals

and things that
they want to achieve

44:54.761 --> 44:57.397
and each one of 'em are okay.

44:57.430 --> 44:59.099

Well, not with anybody.

48:18.064 --> 48:20.567
Uh...the way I see it.

48:27.507 --> 48:29.442
Hello?

they gotta go fix 'em up

- Well, no, because remember,

at least 8% over

50:31.965 --> 50:33.366
and this is
how I'm gonna sell it.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.634
At the same time, my other side
of my brain was like,

50:34.668 --> 50:36.436
"No f---ing way
that's ever working,"

50:36.469 --> 50:40.040
and it f---ing worked!
Yes! Oh!

50:40.073 --> 50:41.541
Yes!

51:11.638 --> 51:13.239

I've been working nonstop

51:27.687 --> 51:29.689
- Busy?
- Yes.

51:29.723 --> 51:31.858

- Babe?

51:33.860 --> 51:35.662
- Yeah?
- Come look.

51:35.695 --> 51:37.864
Come play with him

51:37.897 --> 51:40.600
Show Uncle Fred.
- Mm...

51:40.633 --> 51:43.636
no, I'm fine.
- No?

51:43.670 --> 51:47.407
- So what--how--what have you
been up to since you got here?

51:47.440 --> 51:49.476
I heard you went
to the toy store with Kai.

51:49.509 --> 51:51.144
- Yeah, a lovely time.
- Yeah.

51:51.177 --> 51:52.779
Yeah, we had a good time.

51:52.812 --> 51:54.280

- It's starting to rain, yeah.

52:05.625 --> 52:07.260
I'm gonna go inside.
It's raining.

52:07.293 --> 52:10.830

Hmm?

52:22.709 --> 52:24.944
- Mm.
- What should we do?

52:24.978 --> 52:27.981
- The only way
that I know where I'm safe is,

52:28.081 --> 52:30.450

doing deals.

Nothing's wrong with me.

53:06.119 --> 53:08.154
you're not interested
