00:35.994 --> 00:38.451
Daddy...

00:40.707 --> 00:42.197
Be quiet.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.457
Oh, my god.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.655
- Ana, let's go.
- No.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.282
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.577
Why do we have to leave?

01:20.789 --> 01:22.495
Because it isn't safe here anymore.

01:22.707 --> 01:23.696
Listen to me, darling.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.408
It's really important that you'll be quiet.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.499
It's really important that you'll be quiet.

01:28.254 --> 01:29.414
Do you understand?

01:30.924 --> 01:31.959
- Go.
- Okay.

01:42.393 --> 01:45.305
- Not so fast!
- Come, honey. Come, come.

01:45.855 --> 01:46.935
We're almost there.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.870
Don’t look, honey.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.124
Close the door!

02:25.895 --> 02:27.977
Don 't look, honey. Don 't look.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.320
Go.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.623
How far is it?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.242
It’s not far anymore.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.916
There 's a settlement near El Desoanso.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.540
- We 'll be there at dusk.
- Okay.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.295
Quick, hide!

03:59.489 --> 04:00.478
Do I know you?

04:04.410 --> 04:06.025
- I don 't think so.
- Where are you from?

04:07.705 --> 04:08.615
From nowhere.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.919
What’s your name?

04:15.755 --> 04:16.915
Don 't you have a name?

04:22.303 --> 04:23.258
And you?

04:24.430 --> 04:26.591
- What’s your name, sweetheart?
- That's enough!

04:29.352 --> 04:31.388
Take this one and let us go.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.205
Yes, / think / do know you.
From the supermarket.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.548
Where's the oxy? Where '8 the oxy?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.669
I don 't have it.
We 're leaving the Colonia.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.261
I don 't have it.
We 're leaving the Colonia.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.344
- / don 't believe you. Get in!
- No!

07:41.502 --> 07:43.493
80... Santa Fe.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.210
80... Santa Fe.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.380
Yeah.
You gotta see it.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.961
You gotta see
the mountains there,

07:49.051 --> 07:51.667
the sky, the sunsets.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.504
And there's something that happens
when you take kids out of the city.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.548
You know, without all that noise,
they can hear themselves again.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.594
You know, without all that noise,
they can hear themselves again.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.268
Thank you.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.771
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.685
So...
so you're taking the job?

08:08.696 --> 08:10.436
So...
so you're taking the job?

08:11.782 --> 08:13.488
I think I have to.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.075
They're gonna be lucky
to have you.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.410
Come with me.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.700
You're funny.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.618
No, I can't do that.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.462
Careful, it's not a worm.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.005
Holy shit.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.176
Holy shit.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.849
Will, you got
all serious on me.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.973
I don't want to do
this without you.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.146
Wait, wrong hand,
wrong hand.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.731
You shouldn't have
done this, Will.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.066
You shouldn't have
spent the money.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.863
You could have put it
towards a little house.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.738
Is that a yes? Yes, if there's
a little house?

08:57.787 --> 08:59.778
It's just...
it's so far,

08:59.789 --> 09:01.074
It's just...
it's so far,

09:01.165 --> 09:02.621
New Mexico.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.085
Your parents will be fine.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.788
My mom can't speak English
and my dad's a shut-in.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.748
Look, they have the business,
they have me.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.793
That's... that's all
that they have.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.593
They're stronger
than you think.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.925
I can talk to your dad.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.301
- No, Will.
- I should ask him.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.475
I'll ask him.
I should ask him.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.057
- I should ask him for your hand.
- No.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.809
If you ask for my hand,
he's gonna take yours.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.606
Oh, come on.
He's a sweet old man.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.984
No, he...
you've met him twice.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.312
On good days.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.568
I mean, I'm gonna
talk to my mother.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.070
Okay.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.885
Hey!

11:24.975 --> 11:26.761
Igotonel

11:33.818 --> 11:35.729
Flip up.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.067
Well...

11:40.157 --> 11:42.318
I've never seen anyone do it
quite like that before.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.403
Well, does the student suck
or the teacher?

11:46.414 --> 11:47.449
Well, does the student suck
or the teacher?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.452
- What?
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.374
- It's me.
- It is.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.452
My brother used to give me
shit all the time

11:54.547 --> 11:55.787
because I was always
falling down.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.330
Hmm.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.586
Big brothers like to say
asshole things

11:59.635 --> 12:01.500
just to make you
remember who's boss.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.137
He wasn't wrong.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.930
He was always jumping
off swings

12:06.976 --> 12:09.308
or into a fountain or...

12:09.395 --> 12:11.386
-Hmm.
- Or off a ski lift.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.432
-Hmm.
- Or off a ski lift.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.059
l was always
trying to keep up.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.106
My mom was afraid
to leave us alone

12:16.193 --> 12:19.105
because one of us would end up with
broken bones or stitches.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.699
Where is he now?

12:27.204 --> 12:29.195
I don't know.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.700
I don't know.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.742
But he's...
he's not...

12:33.794 --> 12:35.659
No.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.747
No, he's out there.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.963
At least I think so.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.843
You miss him?

12:44.889 --> 12:47.096
I miss who he was.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.134
I don't know
that I miss who he is.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.812
What about your brother?

12:58.068 --> 13:00.320
He's holed up with a bunch
of culeros in Tijuana.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.573
He's gone.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.285
Come on.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.120
Thirsty?

13:21.759 --> 13:23.920
- What?
- It's cold.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.755
Ice maker's on
the circuit we got going.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.261
Generator's working.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.425
- It's not bad, huh?
- That's nice.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.385
- Can I borrow you?
- Yeah.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.560
I'll see you later.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.272
Wait a second.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.568
I'm coming.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.411
- Why didn't you went to the "Pelicano"?
- Francisco is gone.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.504
Gone?
What do you mean?

13:59.588 --> 14:01.544
He has left us.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.998
Well, maybe he went
to the warehouse without you.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.751
- His family is gone, too.
- Are you sure?

14:06.762 --> 14:08.002
- His family is gone, too.
- Are you sure?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.837
What?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.596
He took his family.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.595
I can't believe
Francisco would desert.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.392
He worked for Alejandro
at the farmacia.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.016
He helped us
build this place.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.566
He saw what happened
to my brother.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.356
The colonia suffers,
but there are other places

14:21.443 --> 14:22.979
and communities
that are doing better than us.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.019
- Whatever. We need water.
- Francisco is my partner.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.110
- Whatever. We need water.
- Francisco is my partner.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.438
I don't leave without him.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.867
Okay, we'll go.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.320
- It's still enough time.
- All right.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.360
We can mark the cars
with gas left,

14:33.455 --> 14:35.446
but we'll drain them fast
if we don't ration.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.247
No generators at night.
No need to call attention to ourselves.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.414
We'll run it
a few hours a week,

14:38.502 --> 14:39.617
just enough to make ice,
boil water.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.668
We can go to Rosarito,
check some cars.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.256
Pemex may have some fuel.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.955
Oh, that's Hector.
Could you please?

14:45.009 --> 14:46.795
I'm sure there's been a run
on all the gas stations.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.210
- Due diligence.
- Ha, sure.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.387
Due diligence.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.390
You.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.267
You took my daughter
from me.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.440
You took her.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.523
Madison.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.151
Victor!

15:09.241 --> 15:11.857
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.075
Don't die on us,
all right?

15:17.124 --> 15:18.204
Your confidence
is overwhelming.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.407
- Where is she?
- In her room.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.707
There are people
with her watching her.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.920
Why don't you keep
them company, Oscar?

15:21.962 --> 15:23.042
There's too many
bodies in here.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.248
Andrés has two years
of med school.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.796
A year and a half,
but maybe I can help.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.081
I need to open
this up.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.591
- Okay.
- Sorry.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.927
I need antiseptic,
alcohol, gauze.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.558
Antibiotics if you can
find them, okay?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.637
There is... there is a first aid kit
in my other room.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.263
There is... there is a first aid kit
in my other room.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.973
- Okay.
- In the closet.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.438
Ilene blames you.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.235
She's not well. She lost her husband
and then her daughter.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.904
Okay, it's not
the right time, Oscar.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.657
I understand grief,
but this is a bit extreme.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.110
She'll come around.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.324
- She'll start to understand.
- She may never understand.

15:58.415 --> 16:01.077
-She may do it again.
- I can make sure she doesn't.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.742
She blames us. Next time, she comes
after me or my nephew.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.828
We watch her
and we decide what to do later.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.121
Right now we take care
of Victor.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.381
- Owl
- Sorry.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.754
You're lucky. Doesn't seem like any of
your organs were punctured.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.426
Yeah? Still hurts like
a son of a bitch.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.220
I can give you
some ibuprofen for the pain.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.639
- With a scotch chaser.
- We'll see what we can find.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.433
- You'll find scotch.
- Yeah, we'll make it happen, Victor.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.853
- I need to stitch you up
as soon as possible. - I got it.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.604
Pressure on
the wound, please.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.354
No, no, this won't work.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.435
I need a suture kit,
antibiotics, and erythropoietin.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.902
I need a suture kit,
antibiotics, and erythropoietin.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.939
It's a medicine that produces more red blood
cells to replace the ones that he's already lost.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.190
It's a medicine that produces more red blood
cells to replace the ones that he's already lost.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.240
If I can't do a transfusion,
it's our best bet.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.068
Okay, write it down.
Write it down.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.612
What about the pharmacies
in Rosarito?

16:39.707 --> 16:41.663
Yes, but they've been looted.
The drugs are gone.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.379
I... I know a place.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.920
It's a drive.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.218
Yvonne, would you please help Mr. Berto?

17:01.562 --> 17:02.517
Thanks.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.767
What happened?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.899
Francisco's gone.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.154
And his family.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.776
Did you know about this?

17:21.331 --> 17:22.867
No.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.712
Two scouts in two weeks.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.666
No thank you.
No good-bye.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.717
Steal into the night
like cowards.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.056
Well, he has a sick child

17:38.098 --> 17:40.009
and the infirmary is full,
water is scarce.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.549
Times of strife
are the true test.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.601
The people should
hear your words.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.981
The scouts,
they should hear yours,

17:49.026 --> 17:51.187
our strongest
and most faithful.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.397
You know what they face
outside the wall.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.775
The dangers.
You see what they see.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.824
You speak to them
and keep it quiet.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.368
Just keep some pressure
on it, okay?

18:09.379 --> 18:10.710
Just keep some pressure
on it, okay?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.414
I'm going
to get your meds.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.874
What do you
want me to do?

18:14.968 --> 18:17.630
- Keep the drinks coming.
- About Ilene.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.712
- She's deranged.
- Yeah, she's a danger.

18:19.723 --> 18:20.758
- She's deranged.
- Yeah, she's a danger.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.056
She'll need
to be watched forever.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.898
She'll need
to be watched forever.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.237
She's lost her balance.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.656
What happens to the larger
balance if I exile her?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.661
Ilene stays locked up.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.536
- How long?
- lndefinitely.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.878
- How long?
- lndefinitely.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.956
- So she's a prisoner? - Yes. It's that
or we put her on the street.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.332
- So she's a prisoner? - Yes. It's that
or we put her on the street.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.417
We can't have violence here.
We can't cross that line.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.838
We can't have violence here.
We can't cross that line.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.631
If it happens again,
if anyone raises a hand to another,

19:03.642 --> 19:05.348
If it happens again,
if anyone raises a hand to another,

19:05.394 --> 19:07.100
they're out.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.267
Any of us, gone.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.056
That's how it has to be.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.101
That's the only way
this works.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.602
That's the only way
this works.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.029
Agreed?

19:20.075 --> 19:21.576
Yeah.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.113
Friends.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.240
Brothers.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.378
Some lost souls have left us.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.128
And my hope for them is vanishing.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.710
Because they lost their faith.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.133
Behind the wall, something worse
than death is waiting for them.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.384
Behind the wall, something worse
than death is waiting for them.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.219
The eternal wasteland. ..

19:52.524 --> 19:53.934
...is waiting for them.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.612
The end of all things.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.617
Death will not befall us.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.117
If we stick together.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.284
We have to trust in us and
in the place we 're living in.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.751
We have to trust in us and
in the place we 're living in.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.417
Stay strong.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.636
Give me your loyalty.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.421
Because there is more...

20:28.810 --> 20:30.801
...that unites us
than that sets us apart from another.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.404
Is he okay?

20:42.449 --> 20:44.064
He's burdened.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.963
We're heading out.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.293
Have you spoken
to the scouts?

21:00.342 --> 21:02.128
No, but I will
as soon as l...

21:02.177 --> 21:03.963
- You said you would speak to them.
- I will as soon as I...

21:04.054 --> 21:06.215
Did you notjust hear
what I just said?

21:06.265 --> 21:07.971
I need everyone here.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.719
Marco's not gonna
wait on us.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.675
I'm not
beholden to that man, that criminal.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.135
We need his water.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.641
Why must you
go now, Luciana?

21:18.735 --> 21:20.441
Hmm?

21:20.487 --> 21:23.479
Because he expected
ustoday.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.989
He expected Francisco
and Reynaldo hours ago.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.236
Do you wish
to follow Francisco?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.408
Do you wish
to follow Francisco?

21:32.457 --> 21:34.539
How could you
think that of me?

21:34.626 --> 21:36.617
This is my home.
You're my people. I wish to serve.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.243
This is my home.
You're my people. I wish to serve.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.627
Speak to the scouts
as | asked.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.509
This is how you serve.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.851
If we don't deliver
the Oxy, they'll come looking for it.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.893
You covered your path, no?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.723
- Yes.
- Then they will not find us.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.320
Nobody leaves
the colonia.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.273
Until when?

22:05.782 --> 22:07.818
Until I say differently.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.246
I could come with you.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.287
Watch Victor for me.
Make sure he has what he needs.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.458
Watch Victor for me.
Make sure he has what he needs.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.372
And you keep him alive.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.668
- This makes no sense. - You refuse
to help me? - I'll do everything I can.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.759
- This makes no sense. - You refuse
to help me? - I'll do everything I can.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.462
I don't want him here.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.513
Keep him alive.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.651
Two hours.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.710
What was that about?

23:02.798 --> 23:04.459
What was what about?

23:04.508 --> 23:06.499
Hector.
You were fighting.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.296
Hector.
You were fighting.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.757
I ask him to come,
he say no.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.600
I was hoping he could convince
his brother to come home.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.137
We need to get
Victor's meds.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.063
We don't have time
for anything else.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.141
- Warehouse and back.
- Antonio is in the warehouse.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.403
- Warehouse and back.
- Antonio is in the warehouse.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.152
Los culeros took him
long ago.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.196
That and the drogas.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.610
As everything was failing,
Antonio came to Rosarito.

23:34.621 --> 23:35.906
As everything was failing,
Antonio came to Rosarito.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.407
He wanted us
to go with him.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.324
He said that the gang
will protect us.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.368
I told him
he should come home.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.002
We would protect
each other.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.171
He chose them
over us.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.791
Hector won't
forgive him for that.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.226
Don't give up on him.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.449
Hey.
You okay?

24:16.079 --> 24:17.865
He knows I would
never leave him.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.537
He's just scared,
all right?

24:19.583 --> 24:20.914
Alejandro's never scared.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.538
Well, people are leaving,
questioning him.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.952
His flock's fractured.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.708
He feels that,
so he's holding on too tight.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.539
We still have
to make the trade.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.174
There's no trade.
You heard him.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.502
These people are waiting
for their medicine, okay?

24:33.555 --> 24:36.046
Best case, they give us
half a cart of water.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.883
Worst case,
they're gonna come for us.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.968
Alejandro has always
known what to do, gringuito.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.685
Alejandro has always
known what to do, gringuito.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.722
- From the beginning.
- Hey, stop calling me that.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.478
I will stop
calling you that...

24:47.527 --> 24:49.813
Oh, curse me in English.
Come on.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.520
- Ungrateful bastard!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.983
Asshole.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.451
Alej... he saved you.
He saved me.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.859
We're here
because of him.

24:56.953 --> 24:59.365
Hey,no,no,no.
I am here because of you.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.200
- Well... I am the boss now.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.371
- Well... I am the boss now.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.291
And I say we stay.

25:47.879 --> 25:48.834
Where is Antonio?

25:49.881 --> 25:52.497
Tell him Elena is here.
I've got something for him.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.643
Could they move
any slower?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.854
We'll get back
in time for him. Don't worry.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.731
You may enter.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.323
Not you. Only the women.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.913
Okay, wait for us here.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.814
ls Luciana all right?

26:51.901 --> 26:53.562
Yeah, she will be.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.322
You all right?

26:58.241 --> 27:00.232
Luciana doesn't
deserve my doubt.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.403
Luciana doesn't
deserve my doubt.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.985
That I should save for
the men outside the wall.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.780
Listen, I really think

27:06.833 --> 27:08.698
if we don't make
this trade now,

27:08.752 --> 27:10.117
those men
will come for us.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.379
Ifthey find us...

27:17.552 --> 27:19.588
they cannot touch us.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.297
Our numbers,
our geography, the wall.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.139
Our numbers,
our geography, the wall.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.842
If those assholes want in,
the wall won't stop them.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.228
This is not
your place, Nick.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.556
It is my place.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.100
I care for this place.

27:35.195 --> 27:38.153
Listen, waiting
for faith to work

27:38.239 --> 27:40.855
or for the dead to wash
the world clean,

27:40.909 --> 27:42.900
like, the danger is now.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.447
like, the danger is now.

27:44.537 --> 27:46.402
It's real.
It's coming, man.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.955
- It's out there.
- You believe in the dead.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.034
You believe in them to protect us
because you have such little faith in me.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.665
You both have such
little faith in me.

27:54.714 --> 27:57.091
I have faith, okay?

27:57.175 --> 27:59.166
Luciana has faith in you.
You attacked her loyalty.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.212
Luciana has faith in you.
You attacked her loyalty.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.294
I never asked to be the one to make
these decisions, but I am.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.887
I never asked to be the one to make
these decisions, but I am.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.813
| concern myself
with our survival.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.470
That's all I care about.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.271
So you want me
to just follow you blindly?

28:14.359 --> 28:16.350
I want you to trust me
like I trust you.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.396
I want you to trust me
like I trust you.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.028
Like a son.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.806
- When was the last time you slept?
- You shouldn't have come here

28:48.852 --> 28:51.013
and you shouldn't have brought this
Americana with you.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.641
We just want to get
what's on this list.

28:59.028 --> 29:01.019
Fish are good,
the ice is better.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.486
Fish are good,
the ice is better.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.156
- Can you get more?
- SI’, as much as you like.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.824
Good,
Marco will want more.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.735
Your brother
has asked about you.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.448
Why didn't he come?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.547
Wait here.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.548
Do not move.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.343
You don 't want anything
to happen to them, right?

29:32.020 --> 29:33.226
Answer, you bastard!

29:35.523 --> 29:36.854
Where is the Colonia?

29:37.066 --> 29:37.976
In the mountains?

29:38.193 --> 29:40.559
Where is our daughter? Please.

29:41.571 --> 29:42.981
She's safe.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.896
What are they saying?

29:44.949 --> 29:47.691
He's taken
their daughter.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.281
- What's he doing to them?
- We stay out of it.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.656
Is he saying
anything about us?

29:51.706 --> 29:54.163
No, he wants the location
to some colonia.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.160
Yes, it is my business. You were
supposed to get us the oxy today.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.536
Yes, it is my business. You were
supposed to get us the oxy today.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.247
- Someone else is coming.
- Luciana?

30:02.467 --> 30:03.957
A gringo with ratty hair?

30:04.052 --> 30:06.043
- What'd he say? - He's asking
about a woman named Luciana...

30:06.137 --> 30:07.968
- and a gringo.
- An American?

30:08.014 --> 30:10.005
Yes, someone
with ratty hair.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.301
Yes, someone
with ratty hair.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.769
He brings them drugs.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.062
Madison,
what are you doing?

30:18.149 --> 30:20.310
Madison, stop.

30:24.447 --> 30:27.314
- Who is bringing me my oxy, asshole?
- Who are you talking about?

30:27.408 --> 30:29.945
Madison, stop.
You don't do this.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.110
Who's the boy? Who is the boy
with the ratty hair?

30:32.205 --> 30:34.241
- Are you trying to kill Victor?
We need the supplies. - Translate for me.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.243
- Translate. Who are they talking about?
- Who is it you're talking about?

30:38.127 --> 30:40.118
- What is the boy's name? Is it Nick? - What's
the boys name? - Don 't say anything, Ana.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.211
- What is the boy's name? Is it Nick? - What's
the boys name? - Don 't say anything, Ana.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.421
- I am sorry.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.586
- No, you know.
- I am sorry.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.920
Enough!

30:47.011 --> 30:49.502
I'm just looking
for my son Nick.

30:49.597 --> 30:52.304
Everyone is looking for someone.
Do you want to disappear, too?

30:52.392 --> 30:54.053
- We walk away now, Madison.
- | just need to know.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.929
We walk away now
or they kill us.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.345
- We walk away.
- Is it north of here, la colonia?

30:58.439 --> 31:00.930
No, just tell me
where you saw him. Was he safe?

31:01.317 --> 31:02.818
Sorry, ldon't know
what's wrong with her.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.234
If I see him, I'll cut oﬁ his balls.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.813
Leave, now.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.027
- What do I tell your brother?
- He should have chosen me.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.408
You can come
back home, Antonio. The hotel is safe.

31:12.495 --> 31:14.656
- This is my family.
- They're not blood.

31:14.747 --> 31:17.124
Don't come back, tla.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.745
We won't be here
much longer.

31:28.636 --> 31:29.921
Reynaldo.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.505
May / ask you something?

31:35.059 --> 31:37.675
Your Spanish isn't that bad, right?

31:38.396 --> 31:40.102
Not good, but not bad either.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.766
It's okay, my English
is also not so good,

31:43.818 --> 31:46.025
but not so bad.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.527
Listen, I know you said

31:48.615 --> 31:51.231
you didn't want to make
the trade without Francisco,

31:51.326 --> 31:52.782
but would you
make it with me?

31:52.827 --> 31:55.489
- You told Luciana?
- No.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.536
No, she won't go
against Alejandro.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.660
But you know, man,
you know.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.083
- We can't keep Marco waiting.
- Alejandro said to wait.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.709
We need more water, okay?

32:03.796 --> 32:05.787
Whatever Alejandro says,
he's not a rain maker.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.459
Whatever Alejandro says,
he's not a rain maker.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.381
More people
are gonna die.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.505
More die,
more leave the colonia.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.133
- What's so funny?
- Americans.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.009
You love to fix
others' problems.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.300
I just give a shit, okay?

32:18.394 --> 32:21.261
I know.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.142
We go tonight, okay?

32:24.233 --> 32:26.098
Okay. All right.

32:29.238 --> 32:32.105
The most important thing
around here is good communication.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.281
Tell me everything you'll
hear through the grapevine.

32:34.494 --> 32:35.984
This is pivotal.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.444
Thank you.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.080
Bye.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.668
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.209
Thanks.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.504
All okay?

32:48.591 --> 32:50.923
- They needed reassurance.
- Yeah?

32:50.969 --> 32:53.051
- What'd you tell them?
- We're Alejandro's inner circle.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.553
We need to demonstrate
strength to the colonia.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.427
Instead of giving into fear,
they should bring those fears to me.

32:58.518 --> 32:59.803
What would they do
without you?

33:01.896 --> 33:03.602
What would I do
without them?

33:03.690 --> 33:05.521
They're like
my brothers.

33:06.901 --> 33:09.187
What is it?

33:09.237 --> 33:11.023
Oh, nothing.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.858
No, it's not nothing.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.697
- You're lying.
- You're not lying.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.900
- "I am not lying. "
- I am not lying.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.407
No. Um...

33:19.497 --> 33:21.863
l was actually
just gonna see

33:21.916 --> 33:23.907
if you wanted
to join me for a drink.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.283
if you wanted
to join me for a drink.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.174
Should I get ice
to cool him down?

33:41.185 --> 33:42.686
Should I get ice
to cool him down?

33:42.770 --> 33:45.022
We need
to keep him warm.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.396
- Get him a blanket.
- Okay.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.357
The blue in the nails?

33:50.445 --> 33:53.152
You've lost blood.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.188
Your heart doesn't have
enough blood to pump to all your organs.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.530
Your heart doesn't have
enough blood to pump to all your organs.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.949
Should I be writing
my will?

34:01.289 --> 34:03.905
The medicine
they're bringing will help.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.914
l'll suture you.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.618
What if they
get held up?

34:08.713 --> 34:11.420
Just keep pressure
on the wound.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.810
You have excellent
bedside manner.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.310
Andres could take
a few tips.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.485
I volunteered at County USC
through high school.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.692
The nurses taught us
that what you don't say to patients

34:40.703 --> 34:41.783
The nurses taught us
that what you don't say to patients

34:41.871 --> 34:44.283
is as important
as what you do say.

34:44.332 --> 34:46.618
For instance?

34:49.045 --> 34:51.832
I'm not gonna tell you
it's gonna be all right.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.835
Why on earth not?

34:56.344 --> 34:58.050
Might not be.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.596
I changed my mind.

35:09.690 --> 35:12.523
Your bedside manner
is abysmal.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.896
You didn't seem like someone
who liked sugar coating.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.654
I don't.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.655
Never needed it.

35:23.746 --> 35:24.952
Same.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.954
No one did it for me.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.504
You said
you raised yourself.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.754
What does that mean?

35:38.845 --> 35:40.756
Um...

35:42.932 --> 35:45.298
I was helping
everyone else.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.760
I was doctor to Nick.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.811
Detox, withdrawals.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.814
And then my dad.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.281
Your mother?

36:02.326 --> 36:04.362
Had her hands full.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.782
You've got her
all to yourself now.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.033
You've got her
all to yourself now.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.828
I didn't want it
like this.

36:18.926 --> 36:20.917
I'm still not sure
she actually sees me.

36:20.928 --> 36:21.963
I'm still not sure
she actually sees me.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.929
Then make her.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.033
Hello, Mom!

37:28.663 --> 37:29.527
Hello!

37:34.126 --> 37:36.538
Leave this to me. I'll do it.

37:36.754 --> 37:37.743
Thank you.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.213
Was Catrina joining the trip?

37:41.425 --> 37:42.756
No, she had to work.

37:43.552 --> 37:46.089
Just me, Talia and Monica went.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.842
Nice girls. Did you have fun?

37:50.268 --> 37:53.135
It was okay. How was your weekend?

37:53.354 --> 37:54.969
Your father was very grumpy.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.973
- Not much business?
- No, it was much to do.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.190
- Not much business?
- No, it was much to do.

37:59.402 --> 38:02.018
He '8 getting bored
if no one is coming.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.941
But he doesn't like it either
when there '8 much to do.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.282
Why did you choose him?

38:08.494 --> 38:09.904
What was the reason?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.954
God entrusted him to me.

38:13.165 --> 38:15.622
- And / obeyed.
- Mama...

38:16.627 --> 38:17.958
I fell in love with him.

38:21.465 --> 38:22.750
He '8 a tough man.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.792
And I'm a tough woman.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.177
It wasn't easy where we 're from.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.589
We suffered together.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.099
And sun/ived together.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.271
- You left a lot behind.
- No, nothing at all.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.064
You were everything for us.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.522
We 're here because of you.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.698
The violence...

38:51.996 --> 38:52.985
All the blood...

38:54.415 --> 38:56.622
You wouldn't believe
what we had to witness.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.500
Don 't dare to imagine it.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.871
Your father still wakes
up from nightmares.

39:02.882 --> 39:03.997
Your father still wakes
up from nightmares.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.343
We didn't want a life like this for you.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.470
No.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.673
The cruelties of the world
shouldn 't ever poison your dreams.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.265
The cruelties of the world
shouldn 't ever poison your dreams.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.766
Until fear is the only thing that is left.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.149
I'd do everything for you.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.396
Like I'd do everything for your father.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.988
Like I'd do everything for your father.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.286
That's love.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.168
Now I understand you, Mama.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.320
- Did you get everything?
- Oscar has it.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.654
- You got it all?
- Yeah, barely.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.576
- What happened?
- Nothing. How is he?

40:16.622 --> 40:18.408
He's lost blood.
Did you get the erythropoietin?

40:18.457 --> 40:21.039
Yeah, they had everything.
Every med with no street value.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.204
- What took so long? - Your mother
tangled with the wrong people.

40:26.298 --> 40:28.334
- What? What happened?
- They mentioned some gringo.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.090
She thought it
was your brother. Could be anyone.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.758
- Did they say something?
- He traded drugs with them.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.552
He was a gringo
with ratty hair.

40:34.723 --> 40:36.554
Oh, shit.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.306
What the hell is she doing?

40:46.068 --> 40:48.104
- Turn it off.
- No, I can't.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.026
- I can't.
- The whole world can see us.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.321
All those people you wanted to stay away,
you're inviting them.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.072
Just have to trust me
on this.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.617
You almost blew the trade.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.404
What if Elena hadn't managed
to get those supplies? What about Victor?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.197
We got the supplies.
We got them.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.578
You risked it

41:03.627 --> 41:06.118
because you heard a rumor about a boy
who may or may not be Nick.

41:06.213 --> 41:09.080
15 miles away.
It has to be him.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.917
- How can you know that?
- You don't understand.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.093
Your child
is always your child.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.011
- He's always...
- I'm your child.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.597
I don't understand.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.637
He chose what's
out there over us.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.058
He chose what's
out there over us.

41:29.361 --> 41:31.352
Maybe he changed his mind.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.145
lnever
changed my mind.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.029
I'm here.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.580
Why isn't that enough?
