00:11.861 --> 00:15.364
It's not often a case takes us
north of Lawrence Avenue.

00:15.365 --> 00:17.699
Well, one Bert Sommers
who owns a homestead

00:17.700 --> 00:20.335
says he needs our help.
Said his horse is missing.

00:20.336 --> 00:22.537
- His horse?
- That's what he said.

00:22.539 --> 00:24.539
You sure it wasn't a cow?

(MOOING)

00:31.214 --> 00:32.347
(HONKING)

00:32.348 --> 00:34.650
Excuse us!

00:35.552 --> 00:37.319
Don't you just love the country?

00:37.320 --> 00:40.155
You city folks
and your fancy umbrellas.

00:41.224 --> 00:43.892
Well... Best be prepared, I suppose.

00:43.893 --> 00:46.328
Rain came down quick today!

00:47.230 --> 00:48.697
So tell us about this horse.

00:48.698 --> 00:51.566
Oh... Plain old horse,

00:51.568 --> 00:53.035
but a farm don't run without one.

00:54.070 --> 00:56.171
I guess Mr. Drake don't see it
that way,

00:56.172 --> 00:58.206
him sending two secretaries

00:58.208 --> 01:00.042
instead of attending
to the matter himself.

01:01.177 --> 01:02.744
Can you give us
a description of the horse?

01:02.745 --> 01:05.013
She's dapple Grey with a white mane.

01:05.013 --> 01:06.448
Handsome creature.

01:06.449 --> 01:07.683
When did she go missing?

01:08.851 --> 01:11.653
This morning, when I called
Camille in for breakfast.

01:12.689 --> 01:14.690
- Camille's your horse?
- No.

01:14.691 --> 01:17.025
- Camille's my daughter.
- Your daughter?

01:17.026 --> 01:20.028
She was working in the garden.
The horse was grazing nearby.

01:20.029 --> 01:22.531
Well, maybe Camille knows
where your horse is.

01:22.532 --> 01:25.867
She won't be no help. She's gone too.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.035
Your daughter's missing?

01:27.036 --> 01:28.870
Didn't I tell you that when I called?

01:29.872 --> 01:31.540
Well, seeing as your horse is missing

01:31.541 --> 01:32.708
and your... your daughter is missing,

01:32.709 --> 01:34.042
perhaps they're missing together.

01:34.043 --> 01:35.544
Where would she go?

01:35.545 --> 01:37.546
I have no idea.

01:37.547 --> 01:40.816
She's such an innocent thing,
church-going.

01:40.817 --> 01:42.818
Hardly ever leaves the place.

01:42.819 --> 01:44.553
Except to sell these here.

01:44.554 --> 01:47.556
Yeah, it was Camille's idea

01:47.557 --> 01:50.392
to grow herbs and fancy vegetables.

01:50.393 --> 01:52.561
She thought there would be
a market for them in the city

01:52.562 --> 01:53.729
and we needed the money.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.297
She sells them to restaurants.

01:55.298 --> 01:57.733
So... Did she go into the city today?

01:57.734 --> 02:00.836
No. Tuesdays and Fridays
are her delivery days.

02:00.837 --> 02:02.838
She takes the horse and cart
and off she goes.

02:02.839 --> 02:04.806
So she was in Toronto yesterday.

02:04.807 --> 02:05.841
Hmm-mmm.

02:05.842 --> 02:07.175
Does she know anyone there?

02:07.176 --> 02:09.777
I don't know.
Never go near the place myself.

02:10.847 --> 02:12.147
Do you mind if I take a look around?

02:12.148 --> 02:14.216
Suit yourself.

02:15.685 --> 02:17.519
Do you think she might have
some friends down there?

02:17.520 --> 02:19.020
None I know of.

02:19.022 --> 02:21.022
Can we get her delivery route?

02:21.024 --> 02:21.990
If you think it will be help.

02:21.991 --> 02:23.525
Anything can at this point.

02:23.526 --> 02:26.027
It's just not like her

02:26.029 --> 02:28.296
to take the horse without telling me.

Seems like he cares about
that horse over his daughter.

02:42.211 --> 02:44.679
I'm sure he cares.
He just doesn't show it.

02:45.715 --> 02:47.382
- Look at this.
- Oh!

02:47.383 --> 02:49.603
Looks like she's not as innocent
as her father thinks.

02:50.553 --> 02:52.053
I wander what else she is hiding.

02:52.055 --> 02:54.222
Maybe more than a bottle of hooch

02:54.223 --> 02:55.590
and a racy novel.

02:56.492 --> 02:57.659
Frankie!

02:57.660 --> 02:58.927
There's fresh footprints.

03:01.397 --> 03:03.098
It rained heavy overnight.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.767
So they're likely from this morning.

03:06.669 --> 03:08.003
That's not from Mr. Sommer's boot.

03:08.004 --> 03:09.204
No.

03:09.205 --> 03:10.672
It looks like a dress shoe.

03:10.673 --> 03:12.841
Seems Camille had a visitor.

03:12.842 --> 03:14.109
Oh!

03:15.845 --> 03:17.112
Cigarette.

03:18.681 --> 03:19.848
It's Turkish.

03:19.849 --> 03:22.417
- Someone with exotic taste.
- Hmm.

03:22.418 --> 03:24.186
Maybe Camille was having a fling

03:24.187 --> 03:26.188
and didn't want her father
to find out about it.

03:26.189 --> 03:29.191
She and said fling
took off on Daddy's horse.

03:29.192 --> 03:31.193
Can't blame her for running away

03:31.194 --> 03:32.794
from a struggling farm.

03:35.698 --> 03:36.965
Take a look at this.

03:41.204 --> 03:43.438
Seems like Camille was in a hurry.

03:43.439 --> 03:44.873
Did she run away with someone...

03:44.874 --> 03:47.976
Or was she running away from someone?

04:02.525 --> 04:04.526
Last stop on Camille's route.

04:04.527 --> 04:06.495
Hopefully they have
something more useful

04:06.496 --> 04:08.663
than compliments
about her vegetable garden.

04:08.664 --> 04:09.831
My ma has a vegetable garden.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.500
She takes a lot of pride in it.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.268
That's right! Doesn't she make
a mean rhubarb pie?

04:13.269 --> 04:14.603
Oh, I remember that pie!

04:14.604 --> 04:16.438
- And now, I'm hungry.
- Me too!

04:29.185 --> 04:31.853
Officer Shaw,
keeping the city streets safe.

04:31.854 --> 04:32.854
There you are. I won't be long,

04:32.855 --> 04:34.523
I'm just finishing this report.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.525
We're gonna have to make
a little detour

04:36.526 --> 04:38.527
on our way to lunch.
Gotta visit a crime scene.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.695
A crime scene? Are you collecting

04:40.696 --> 04:42.531
forensic evidence? Can I help?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.699
Nothing to collect
except for the coroner's hat

04:44.700 --> 04:46.868
that he left behind.
He asked me to pick it up.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.271
Too bad. Well, at least
we'll get to go for a walk.

04:49.272 --> 04:50.839
Interview everyone!

04:50.840 --> 04:52.207
Anything else is out of the ordinary,

04:52.208 --> 04:53.542
I want to know about it,
however small.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.076
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.144
Thank you.

04:56.145 --> 04:58.146
That Officer Greyson...

04:58.147 --> 04:59.748
What about him?

05:01.017 --> 05:03.485
You know, he's pretty handsome
when you see him up close.

05:03.486 --> 05:05.587
In a detective sort of way.

05:06.489 --> 05:08.456
How about an introduction, Mary?

05:09.826 --> 05:13.161
He's very busy
and this isn't a good time.

05:13.162 --> 05:14.596
Let's go.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.934
- Flo!
- Hmm!

05:24.507 --> 05:27.676
Camille brings the vegetables.
I pay her. Why you asking?

05:27.677 --> 05:29.044
She's missing.

05:30.513 --> 05:32.514
Ain't that a jam.

05:32.515 --> 05:35.517
- Anything else you can tell us?
- What's there to tell?

05:35.518 --> 05:37.519
She's a country girl,

05:37.520 --> 05:38.653
straw hat, the whole shebang.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.555
Blinded by the lights
of the city maybe.

05:41.691 --> 05:43.692
Is there anyone
that she ever talked about?

05:43.693 --> 05:45.026
Maybe someone who knows her?

05:45.027 --> 05:46.528
You could try Hank at the stable.

05:46.529 --> 05:48.697
She took her horse there
when he was lamed.

05:48.698 --> 05:50.532
She'd talk about him sometimes.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.334
She'd get all tongue tied
when she did.

05:52.335 --> 05:54.736
- Where's the stable?
- Down on Cherry.

05:54.737 --> 05:57.238
- This side of the tracks.
- Thanks.

05:58.641 --> 06:00.475
Stable's a good place
to hide a missing horse.

06:00.476 --> 06:03.144
Maybe Hank has an exotic taste
for cigarettes.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.813
You're thinking
that Camille wasn't abducted?

06:04.814 --> 06:06.081
Let's find out.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.487
Camille...

06:13.489 --> 06:14.823
Haven't seen her in a week or two.

06:14.824 --> 06:16.491
Which is it? One week or two?

06:16.492 --> 06:18.159
Well, I guess
it's more like two weeks.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.494
- I'll look around.
- Hey, where are you going?

06:19.495 --> 06:21.663
- Mind if I take a look inside?
- You can't go in there!

06:21.664 --> 06:22.831
Why is that?
You're trying to hide something?

06:22.832 --> 06:24.833
- Or rather someone...
- I said stay out!

06:24.834 --> 06:26.001
- (RATTLING)
- Hey!

06:27.570 --> 06:29.204
Slow down, farm girl!

06:29.205 --> 06:30.505
Get off of me! Who are you?

06:30.506 --> 06:32.674
Frankie Drake and Trudy Clarke.

06:32.675 --> 06:33.842
We're private detectives.

06:34.844 --> 06:36.044
What do you mean? Who hired you?

06:36.045 --> 06:37.145
Your father.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.714
If you and Hank
were trying to run away,

06:39.715 --> 06:41.683
you sure were doing a poor job.

06:41.684 --> 06:43.018
Oh no! You got it all wrong.

06:43.019 --> 06:45.186
Hank here was just trying to help me.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.022
I'm sorry, Camille.
I tried to stop them.

06:47.023 --> 06:48.690
It's okay, Hank.
You did your best for me.

06:48.691 --> 06:50.225
So why would you run away
from the farm

06:50.226 --> 06:51.860
- in such a hurry?
- Because a man came

06:51.861 --> 06:54.362
into the garden this morning
and tried to kill me!

06:54.363 --> 06:56.464
- How do you know?
- He had a knife.

06:56.465 --> 06:58.633
I jumped on my horse
and got out of there!

06:58.634 --> 06:59.734
I tore my dress.

06:59.735 --> 07:00.969
Why would this man want to hurt you?

07:00.970 --> 07:02.137
I don't know.

07:02.138 --> 07:04.973
But I saw him yesterday on my route.

07:04.974 --> 07:06.241
Where?

07:06.242 --> 07:07.809
So tell us what happened, Camille.

07:07.810 --> 07:10.245
Well... I was standing right here...

07:10.246 --> 07:11.813
<i>I had just loaded my basket</i>

07:11.814 --> 07:13.982
<i>with vegetables and herbs
for the restaurant.</i>

07:13.983 --> 07:15.150
<i>When I turned to go...</i>

07:15.151 --> 07:17.786
this man nearly bowled me over.

07:17.787 --> 07:19.988
All the vegetables
went flying everywhere.

07:19.989 --> 07:22.624
He didn't stop to help me.
He just kept going.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.826
- He looked desperate.
- Where did he go?

07:24.827 --> 07:27.395
Just there. He looked back...

07:29.899 --> 07:32.000
...got in his car and sped off.

07:32.001 --> 07:33.335
Did you get a good look at him?

07:33.336 --> 07:35.503
- Hmm-mmm!
- Anyone else around?

07:35.504 --> 07:36.671
- No.
- Did you see

07:36.672 --> 07:38.740
- or hear anything else?
- Nothing.

07:38.741 --> 07:40.842
He must think you saw
something incriminating,

07:40.843 --> 07:42.777
otherwise he wouldn't have
followed you to the farm.

07:42.778 --> 07:45.447
Well, if I did, I...
I don't know what it is.

07:45.448 --> 07:47.015
So he ran past you here...

07:47.016 --> 07:49.284
which means he must
have come from there...

07:50.286 --> 07:51.686
What are you girls doing here?

07:51.687 --> 07:53.688
Picking up the coroner's hat.
He left it at a crime scene.

07:53.689 --> 07:55.457
- What crime scene?
- There was a murder.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.958
In the Queen's Hotel.
What are you doing here?

07:56.959 --> 07:58.627
Not sure yet.
Tell us more about this murder.

07:58.628 --> 08:01.296
A hotel guest was stabbed
to death in their room.

08:01.297 --> 08:03.965
Right there. Unpleasant way
to end a vacation.

08:03.966 --> 08:06.301
- When was that?
- Yesterday afternoon.

08:06.302 --> 08:08.303
This may explain things.

08:08.304 --> 08:09.637
What's going on, Frankie?

08:09.639 --> 08:11.806
I think this woman
may have seen the killer.

08:11.807 --> 08:14.142
Oh no! I didn't see
anyone murder anyone.

08:14.143 --> 08:15.810
But the killer probably thinks

08:15.811 --> 08:17.312
that you saw him in that window.

08:17.313 --> 08:19.147
That's why he came looking for you.

08:19.148 --> 08:21.816
I don't understand.
How did he find me?

08:21.817 --> 08:23.651
You're not that hard
to track you down.

08:23.653 --> 08:25.520
The farm's name and address is
written on the back of the cart.

08:25.521 --> 08:27.689
Oh no...

08:27.690 --> 08:28.990
Can you describe him?

08:29.992 --> 08:33.328
He was fair, quite tall,
well-dressed...

08:33.328 --> 08:35.163
he had a hat... and a cane.

08:35.164 --> 08:37.065
Anything else?

08:37.066 --> 08:39.134
Just the car. It was red.

08:39.135 --> 08:41.669
Red? Well, that's unusual.
Did you get the license plate?

08:41.671 --> 08:43.337
Only the first two numbers.

08:43.339 --> 08:46.441
16. I remembered because
that's my birthday. July 16th.

08:47.543 --> 08:49.177
Mary, can you look
into the license plate?

08:49.178 --> 08:50.263
I can try.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.180
Flo, we're gonna need to
take a look at that body.

08:52.181 --> 08:54.115
No problem. He's not going anywhere.

08:55.017 --> 08:56.184
What about me?

08:56.185 --> 08:57.652
We'll let your father know
that you're safe,

08:57.653 --> 08:58.787
but you can't go back to the farm.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.788
The killer's still after you.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.489
- Is my father in danger?
- No,

09:01.490 --> 09:02.624
but the killer's after you.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.792
We gotta to get you somewhere safe.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.661
- Where are you taking me?
- Get in!

09:07.797 --> 09:10.198
What are we doing
in a place like this?

09:15.471 --> 09:17.338
So this is her?

09:18.307 --> 09:19.808
- Who are you?
- Camille Sommers,

09:19.809 --> 09:21.976
meet Nora Amory. My mother.

09:21.977 --> 09:23.812
Despite opinion to the contrary,

09:23.813 --> 09:25.046
I don't bite.

09:25.047 --> 09:26.481
She'll take care of you,

09:26.482 --> 09:28.049
- I promise.
- You sure?

09:28.050 --> 09:30.485
Nora's one tough broad.
You'll see soon enough.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.654
When you said
she was fresh off the farm,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.989
I didn't expect the whole
country mouse routine.

09:34.990 --> 09:36.291
She's terrified!

09:36.292 --> 09:38.660
Just make her comfortable,
if you can manage that.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.995
Well, you know me.
My middle name's comfort.

09:40.996 --> 09:42.163
That's not very reassuring.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.164
Well, then why did you bring her here?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.499
No one's gonna expect her to be

09:44.500 --> 09:45.834
in a swanky place like this.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.670
- What?
- She's hardly incognito!

09:48.671 --> 09:50.638
I mean, she stands out
like a sore thumb.

09:50.639 --> 09:52.307
Just go easy on her.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.276
Me? I'm always easy.

09:59.248 --> 10:02.784
The straw hat and the drab dress
have got to go.

10:07.839 --> 10:09.673
What do you mean,
the funeral director is

10:09.674 --> 10:12.676
on his way to pick up the body?
You tell him to hold his horses.

10:12.677 --> 10:15.212
Dr. Thompson hasn't signed
the release form yet.

10:15.213 --> 10:17.347
Oh. You already have it.

10:17.348 --> 10:19.683
Well, it's not the first time
he's kept me out of the loop.

10:19.684 --> 10:22.185
But you know what?
I won't send a respectable man

10:22.187 --> 10:24.021
halfway across the city in the buff.

10:24.022 --> 10:26.456
Can you... can you buy me a half hour?

10:27.358 --> 10:28.525
Okay, hon. Thank you.

10:28.526 --> 10:30.360
Thank you! I appreciate it.

10:30.361 --> 10:32.195
- Hey, Flo.
- There you are.

10:32.197 --> 10:35.232
You got here just in time.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.533
Our friend was almost whisked away

10:36.534 --> 10:37.701
to his final resting place.

10:37.702 --> 10:39.036
What can you tell us about him?

10:39.037 --> 10:41.204
Archibald Carnegie was an American

10:41.206 --> 10:42.706
visiting from Chicago.

10:42.707 --> 10:44.541
Stabbed to death
by an unknown assailant

10:44.542 --> 10:46.543
in his first floor room
at the Queen's Hotel.

10:46.544 --> 10:49.212
The wound was a clean thrust
with a sharp blade,

10:49.214 --> 10:50.647
likely a dagger.

10:50.648 --> 10:52.582
- Oh!
- Those are his belongings.

10:54.986 --> 10:56.653
Oh!

10:56.654 --> 10:58.288
It's one nice suit!

10:59.324 --> 11:00.824
This wasn't cheap either.

11:00.825 --> 11:03.427
Mr. Carnegie wasn't short of money.

11:04.829 --> 11:06.763
Makes sense.
He was an investment banker.

11:06.764 --> 11:08.832
That explains the nice threads.

11:08.833 --> 11:11.168
He was identified
by the hotel's desk clerk.

11:11.169 --> 11:13.503
Said he wasn't shy
about flashing around his cash.

11:13.504 --> 11:17.007
Looks like he wanted to keep
some things he keeps private.

11:17.008 --> 11:19.109
What's that?

11:19.110 --> 11:20.510
Looks like a key

11:20.511 --> 11:22.512
to a locker from the train station.

11:22.513 --> 11:24.348
Number 160.

11:24.349 --> 11:25.849
Maybe Union Station.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.352
Why would you hide a key
in the heel of your shoe?

11:28.353 --> 11:30.020
Only one way to find out.

11:30.021 --> 11:32.856
You ladies get out.
I have to dress Mr. C.

11:32.857 --> 11:34.958
Ne needs some privacy.

11:36.027 --> 11:37.160
I don't know about this.

11:37.161 --> 11:39.629
How come I need to change my clothes?

11:39.631 --> 11:41.531
You need to look like you
belong in the city, honey.

11:41.532 --> 11:43.367
Who's going to see me?

11:43.368 --> 11:44.868
A gal's got to be
prepared for anything.

11:44.869 --> 11:46.870
I mean, who knows, you may have
to make a run for it.

11:46.871 --> 11:49.039
A dress is only as good
as the girl who's wearing it,

11:49.040 --> 11:50.974
so stand up straight.
We're not milking cows here.

11:50.975 --> 11:53.010
See? Now, you're gonna try
and put a little sass

11:53.011 --> 11:54.911
in your walk. Watch, like this.

11:54.913 --> 11:57.080
You try and throw some hip into it.

11:58.149 --> 11:59.483
Okay, well, that needs some practice.

11:59.484 --> 12:02.085
Here! See what magic
you can do with that.

12:07.025 --> 12:08.325
There. See?

12:08.326 --> 12:09.326
You'll pass.

12:09.327 --> 12:10.827
Oh my!

12:10.828 --> 12:12.729
If Hank could see me now.

12:12.730 --> 12:14.998
- Is Hank your sweetheart?
- You could say that.

12:14.999 --> 12:17.534
Do all city girls look like this?

12:17.535 --> 12:19.336
The secret is making
your own kind of glamour.

12:19.337 --> 12:21.038
You believe in yourself
and the world's gonna buy

12:21.039 --> 12:22.339
the whole kit and caboodle.

12:22.340 --> 12:23.840
Frankie sure is lucky

12:23.841 --> 12:25.342
to have her mother like you
around to teach her.

12:25.343 --> 12:27.611
Yeah, well, Frankie more
or less taught herself.

12:30.014 --> 12:32.015
(KNOCKING)

12:32.016 --> 12:34.284
Mrs. Amory? It's the hotel manager.

12:34.285 --> 12:35.352
Chut!

12:35.353 --> 12:37.788
(KNOCKING)

12:38.690 --> 12:40.457
I know you're in there.

12:43.695 --> 12:46.696
Mrs. Amory! We have to talk
about your last cheque.

12:46.698 --> 12:48.965
I regret to inform you it bounced.

12:49.901 --> 12:51.068
Again.

12:53.805 --> 12:56.973
This matter must be resolved
with some urgency, madam.

12:59.344 --> 13:02.045
To that end, rest assured that...

13:02.046 --> 13:03.914
I will be back.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.320
Are we going to get kicked out?

13:10.321 --> 13:12.489
Of course not. I'm just
a little late paying my bill.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.024
- How late is late?
- I don't know, six months.

13:14.025 --> 13:16.093
- Give or take.
- Isn't that really late? Is it?

13:16.094 --> 13:17.494
Yeah, well... Maybe I'm running out

13:17.495 --> 13:18.829
of wiggle room here.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.064
Anyway, that's no concern of yours.

13:21.065 --> 13:23.333
How come you live in a hotel anyway?

13:23.334 --> 13:25.836
Oh! That, my dear,
is an interesting story.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.671
A lot of it, trade secrets. But...

13:27.672 --> 13:30.507
Nora Amory has lived many lives.

13:30.508 --> 13:32.009
Nora Amory. You could be a character

13:32.010 --> 13:33.944
in a Judith Dawes book.

13:33.945 --> 13:36.413
Doesn't she write
those racy romance novels?

13:36.414 --> 13:38.849
My father only has the Bible
to read at the farm,

13:38.850 --> 13:40.517
but I like to buy them
when I'm in the city

13:40.518 --> 13:41.685
and read them in secret.

13:41.686 --> 13:45.188
I love romance and adventure.

13:45.189 --> 13:46.569
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

13:47.358 --> 13:49.459
So why do you live in a hotel?

13:52.964 --> 13:54.464
Alright, honey, saddle up.

13:54.465 --> 13:57.067
I've got tales to tell.
Can you be discreet?

13:58.302 --> 13:59.402
Yes.

14:01.806 --> 14:03.073
(DOOR OPENS)

14:05.476 --> 14:06.476
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

14:06.477 --> 14:08.145
Trudy, you have to hear this.

14:08.146 --> 14:10.313
"He took her in his muscular arms.

14:10.314 --> 14:12.315
"Her heart pounded against the warmth

14:12.316 --> 14:13.984
"of his mighty chest.

14:13.985 --> 14:16.319
""The city of love", she whispered.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.489
"The lights on the Eiffel tower
glistened in the night air

14:19.490 --> 14:21.324
"as he brought her quivering lips

14:21.325 --> 14:22.425
to meet his."

14:23.394 --> 14:25.328
(LAUGHING)

14:25.329 --> 14:26.830
Camille sure likes to dream.

14:26.831 --> 14:29.332
Well, a gal's dream
deserves better prose.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.334
Do the lights of the Eiffel tower

14:31.335 --> 14:32.869
- really glisten?
- Not when I was there.

14:32.870 --> 14:35.105
But there was a war
going on at the time.

14:36.174 --> 14:37.440
Bingo.

14:40.845 --> 14:43.613
Let's see what was in locker 160.

14:45.516 --> 14:47.517
Not the quality of suit he was wearing

14:47.518 --> 14:49.019
- when he was killed.
- Nope.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.055
Strange. This is the wardrobe
of a completely different man.

14:58.129 --> 15:00.964
Archibald Carnegie
wasn't an investment banker.

15:00.965 --> 15:04.034
He was a claims investigator
for Primary.

15:04.035 --> 15:07.170
Primary? That's only the largest
insurance company in America.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.311
One hundred thousand dollars...

15:14.312 --> 15:15.478
Not exactly pocket change.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.314
A bearer bond is equivalent to cash

15:17.315 --> 15:18.648
and completely untraceable.

15:18.649 --> 15:20.317
Right. To be used for money laundering

15:20.318 --> 15:21.818
- and other shady deals.
- Exactly.

15:21.819 --> 15:23.820
But what is an insurance investigator

15:23.821 --> 15:25.889
doing with 100 000$ in his suitcase?

15:25.890 --> 15:29.726
Maybe the 100 000$ is
the reason that he was killed.

15:29.727 --> 15:31.962
Oh! It's a newspaper article.

15:31.963 --> 15:34.764
- How's your German?
- Hmm. A bit rusty.

15:35.867 --> 15:39.903
It's a news report
about a stolen diamond

15:39.904 --> 15:42.572
that surfaced in Vienna recently.

15:43.574 --> 15:46.676
The police moved in, arrested a fence,

15:46.677 --> 15:48.345
but the seller got away
with the diamond

15:48.346 --> 15:49.946
and is still at large.

15:54.051 --> 15:55.285
Oh!

15:55.286 --> 15:57.454
196 carats.

15:57.455 --> 15:59.789
This must be the diamond
they're talking about.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.558
Carnegie was the investigator.

16:01.559 --> 16:03.126
What was he doing in Toronto?

16:03.127 --> 16:05.128
Maybe he followed the thief here.

16:05.129 --> 16:06.730
I guess he's a good investigator.

16:06.731 --> 16:08.064
Was.

16:13.304 --> 16:15.805
There's... there's something
hinky about this bond.

16:15.806 --> 16:17.907
It feels... thin.

16:18.976 --> 16:20.477
Trudy, can you look into it?

16:20.478 --> 16:22.778
I'm going to see what I can
find out about this diamond.

16:23.781 --> 16:26.316
Oh, I wasn't going to let him
get away with it that easily,

16:26.317 --> 16:28.251
so I followed him
until he stopped at a light.

16:28.252 --> 16:30.487
I edged in close enough
to slip my hand

16:30.488 --> 16:33.323
into his pocket like so
and relieved him of his wallet.

16:33.324 --> 16:35.625
- And he never felt a thing!
- How did you do it?

16:35.626 --> 16:39.829
The key is to move fast
and slow at the same time.

16:40.831 --> 16:42.666
You sure do know a lot
about a lot of things.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.334
A gal's gotta go what a gal's gotta do

16:44.335 --> 16:46.136
to get ahead in this world.

16:46.137 --> 16:48.004
(KNOCKING) He didn't waste any time.

16:48.005 --> 16:50.774
- Nora, open up. It's me
- Oh! Just Frankie.

16:50.775 --> 16:53.276
No need for her to know about
my little money problem. Hmm?

16:53.277 --> 16:55.879
Use the code knock!

16:56.781 --> 16:58.715
- Any news?
- Not yet.

16:59.884 --> 17:01.017
Uh!

17:01.018 --> 17:03.653
I see Nora's worked her magic on you.

17:03.654 --> 17:05.121
It's so I'm incognito

17:05.122 --> 17:06.455
in case we need to make
a quick getaway.

17:06.457 --> 17:08.157
Your mother thinks of everything.

17:08.159 --> 17:10.160
- Doesn't she just.
- I'll take the compliment.

17:10.161 --> 17:12.127
I need to pick your brain
about jewels,

17:12.128 --> 17:14.297
- diamonds to be precise.
- Yeah, sure.

17:14.298 --> 17:15.632
What do you wanna know?

17:17.801 --> 17:19.202
It's her! I don't believe it.

17:19.203 --> 17:20.436
What?

17:20.438 --> 17:22.806
Oh, Frankie, come on!
You don't know the Antoinette?

17:22.807 --> 17:23.973
I mean, who the heck raised you?

17:23.974 --> 17:25.075
Don't answer that.

17:25.076 --> 17:26.810
Oh, this rock is legendary.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.478
Out of this world!

17:28.479 --> 17:30.814
The original stone was found in India,

17:30.815 --> 17:33.149
then cut by Cartier,
along with a sister diamond,

17:33.150 --> 17:35.318
the Carolina. Yeah, well,
the Carolina is now owned

17:35.319 --> 17:36.820
by some private collector
down in the States,

17:36.821 --> 17:39.022
but the Antoinette...
Oh, that's the finer of the two.

17:39.023 --> 17:40.990
- Recently stolen.
- Yeah, from Paris,

17:40.992 --> 17:42.158
some months ago.

17:42.159 --> 17:44.194
A pretty audacious theft
is what I heard.

17:44.195 --> 17:46.596
So, why the sudden interest?

17:47.598 --> 17:48.999
The Antoinette might be the reason

17:49.000 --> 17:50.166
that Camille is in danger.

17:51.102 --> 17:52.836
What? You're kidding! How?

17:52.837 --> 17:54.504
It may have surfaced.

17:54.505 --> 17:56.606
Oh! And I suppose
you would like me to contact

17:56.607 --> 17:59.376
a certain gentleman I know and
make some discreet inquiries?

17:59.377 --> 18:01.611
- Well, since you're offering...
- I wasn't, but I will.

18:01.612 --> 18:03.012
And you're welcome.

18:05.449 --> 18:06.716
Go easy.

18:07.618 --> 18:08.718
What?

18:08.719 --> 18:10.720
Stay on your toes.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.726
Do you and Frankie work together?

18:16.727 --> 18:17.961
Occasionally.

18:17.962 --> 18:19.295
Operator!

18:19.297 --> 18:21.231
Placing a call to New York City.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.234
Yeah. 95992.

18:24.235 --> 18:26.403
You make a great team.
What else do you get up to?

18:26.404 --> 18:28.638
Yeah, we don't really spend
much time together.

18:28.639 --> 18:30.640
- That's a shame.
- Yeah, just the way it is.

18:30.641 --> 18:31.808
Hello!

18:31.809 --> 18:34.677
Hello, Lenny? Yeah, it's me, darling.

18:34.679 --> 18:38.214
Oh, I know, I know,
it's been ages, but here I am.

18:38.215 --> 18:39.816
Well, of course I want your help.

18:39.817 --> 18:41.384
Why else would I be calling?

18:44.322 --> 18:45.655
Constable Ripley!

18:45.656 --> 18:46.990
Please tell me you've got something.

18:46.991 --> 18:48.725
I checked the hotel room again, sir.

18:48.726 --> 18:51.428
And no one saw anyone come or go
from Mr. Carnegie's room.

18:51.429 --> 18:53.263
That's terrific.
So even if we had a lead

18:53.264 --> 18:55.265
on Carnegie's killer, which we don't,

18:55.266 --> 18:56.499
we'd still have nothing to prove it.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.435
No fingerprints, no murder weapon.

18:58.436 --> 18:59.769
I'm sorry.

18:59.770 --> 19:02.038
Just... get back to work.

19:08.312 --> 19:10.280
- I met with Freddy the Forger.
- And?

19:10.281 --> 19:11.948
The bond is the best he's seen.

19:11.949 --> 19:13.416
- But it is a forgery.
- Yep.

19:13.417 --> 19:14.784
And you were right
about the weight of the paper.

19:14.785 --> 19:16.353
Freddy was impressed
you figured that out.

19:16.354 --> 19:19.622
So an insurance investigator
is in Toronto

19:19.623 --> 19:21.291
with a forged bearer bond...

19:21.292 --> 19:23.927
Disguised as a wealthy banker. Why?

19:25.463 --> 19:28.298
- He was buying the diamond.
- He was setting up the thief.

19:28.299 --> 19:30.467
So they set up a meeting
at the Queen's Hotel...

19:30.468 --> 19:31.968
But it doesn't go right and the thief

19:31.969 --> 19:33.837
figures out Carnegie's ruse
and kills him.

19:33.838 --> 19:35.171
And then he runs out the back door...

19:35.172 --> 19:36.406
Running into Camille.

19:36.407 --> 19:38.475
He thinks that she's seen
more than she has,

19:38.476 --> 19:40.443
so he decides
to take care of her as well.

19:40.444 --> 19:41.845
(SIGHS)

19:41.846 --> 19:43.480
It's one dangerous character.

19:43.481 --> 19:47.317
Well, there's a black cloud
hanging over the station today.

19:47.318 --> 19:49.486
They have nothing
on Carnegie's killer.

19:49.487 --> 19:51.354
Detective Greyson
is in a real funk about it.

19:51.355 --> 19:53.990
- What about the car?
- I'm not sure.

19:53.991 --> 19:55.892
I have found a red sedan
with a 16 on the plate.

19:55.893 --> 19:57.827
- Good work, Mary.
- Well...

19:57.828 --> 20:00.163
It's registered to a widow
who lives here in Toronto.

20:00.164 --> 20:02.665
A Mrs. Edith Burns-Higgins.

20:02.666 --> 20:05.101
Doesn't sound much
like a killer to me.

20:06.003 --> 20:07.504
We need a picture of that car.

20:07.505 --> 20:09.839
Maybe Mrs. Burns-Higgins has a driver

20:09.840 --> 20:11.474
with a murderous sideline.

20:13.711 --> 20:16.012
This is a gin Rickey cocktail.

20:16.013 --> 20:17.514
Favorite of Scott Fitzgerald.

20:17.515 --> 20:18.848
Speaking of which,

20:18.849 --> 20:21.518
you might want to expand
your reading beyond Miss Dawes.

20:21.519 --> 20:23.386
But I love her stories.

20:23.387 --> 20:24.521
Yeah, sure you do,

20:24.522 --> 20:27.524
but broadening your horizons
isn't a bad thing.

20:27.525 --> 20:29.292
I'm beginning to figure that out.

20:30.361 --> 20:31.861
You think Hank will still like a girl

20:31.862 --> 20:33.062
who stepped out of the nest?

20:33.063 --> 20:35.198
Well, as long
as she's stepping out with him,

20:35.199 --> 20:36.466
I don't see why not.

20:38.869 --> 20:42.372
Hmmm! Not your first kick
at the gin can, I see.

20:42.373 --> 20:43.873
(KNOCKING)

20:43.874 --> 20:47.377
Mrs. Amory! We need to talk
and I'm not leaving this time.

20:47.378 --> 20:48.778
(SIGHS)

20:49.880 --> 20:52.482
I think it might be time
to face the music.

20:54.652 --> 20:55.919
Wait.

20:58.322 --> 20:59.756
Let me handle this.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.267
Don't come any closer.

21:12.336 --> 21:13.836
But I must speak to Mrs. Amory.

21:13.838 --> 21:15.338
I'm afraid that's not possible.

21:15.339 --> 21:18.708
She has a highly contagious case
of... the measles.

21:18.709 --> 21:20.910
- Who are you?
- I'm her niece.

21:20.911 --> 21:22.712
Mrs. Amory has a family?

21:22.713 --> 21:25.682
Estranged from her sister, sadly.

21:25.683 --> 21:27.850
I've defied my mother's wishes
by helping to nurse

21:27.852 --> 21:29.218
my poor aunt back to health.

21:29.220 --> 21:32.722
I hope to heal the rift between
the two with my sacrifice.

21:32.723 --> 21:34.357
That may be so,

21:34.358 --> 21:36.693
but I can't have people
with contagious diseases

21:36.694 --> 21:38.361
in my hotel. She'll have
to leave immediately.

21:38.362 --> 21:42.165
Sir, I'm aware of my aunt's
financial predicament.

21:42.166 --> 21:45.702
And I can assure you
that once Mrs. Amory's illness

21:45.703 --> 21:47.637
resolves itself one way or the other,

21:47.638 --> 21:49.038
if you catch my meaning,

21:49.039 --> 21:50.506
my family will pay any debts.

21:50.508 --> 21:52.642
And of course there will be
a little something extra

21:52.643 --> 21:55.345
- for your patience.
- What guarantee do I have?

21:55.346 --> 21:57.113
Is my word not enough?

21:58.649 --> 22:00.350
I'd prefer to hear from your mother.

22:00.351 --> 22:01.517
It's not possible.

22:01.519 --> 22:04.687
Currently, she's taking
the waters in Baden Baden.

22:04.688 --> 22:06.689
Clearly I should speak
to your superior.

22:06.690 --> 22:08.591
- Where is he?
- Uh...

22:09.560 --> 22:10.994
I'm sure that in this one instance,

22:10.995 --> 22:14.330
- perhaps I can make an exception.
- Excellent.

22:14.331 --> 22:15.832
Then I thank you to leave us in peace.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.100
No need...

22:19.336 --> 22:20.837
- How was that?
- Bravo!

22:20.838 --> 22:22.005
Measles! Brilliant.

22:22.006 --> 22:23.172
Family rift, inspired.

22:23.173 --> 22:25.842
But Baden Baden takes the biscuit!

22:25.843 --> 22:27.343
- Where'd you dig that up?
- From one of those

22:27.344 --> 22:29.846
Miss Dawes stories you think
I shouldn't read anymore.

22:29.847 --> 22:31.848
I take it all back.
Miss Dawes is a genius!

22:31.849 --> 22:34.183
To romance and adventure!

22:34.184 --> 22:36.452
Well, adventure does have its price.

22:36.453 --> 22:37.787
What do you mean?

22:38.856 --> 22:40.690
You kept the manager at bay for now,

22:40.691 --> 22:42.358
but you gotta be realistic.

22:42.359 --> 22:45.395
Sometimes you gotta know
when the jig is up.

22:45.396 --> 22:46.696
But you're Nora Amory.

22:46.697 --> 22:49.232
You can reinvent yourself
someplace else.

22:52.803 --> 22:54.137
What's keeping you here?

22:54.138 --> 22:55.571
Oh...

22:57.474 --> 23:00.476
It's Frankie, isn't it?

23:00.477 --> 23:02.311
Yeah. Well, might have been.

23:02.313 --> 23:03.513
You know, uh...

23:03.514 --> 23:05.648
Things just didn't work out between us

23:05.649 --> 23:08.418
- the way that I'd hoped..
- Can't you fix things?

23:10.487 --> 23:12.755
Too late for that.

23:14.658 --> 23:16.659
No happy ending to this story.

23:16.660 --> 23:19.829
Sorry, kiddo. (KNOCKING)

23:19.830 --> 23:20.830
Speak of the devil.

23:20.831 --> 23:23.099
- Do you want to get that?
- Sure.

23:26.270 --> 23:28.504
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

23:28.505 --> 23:30.673
Well, if it isn't
the intrepid detective.

23:30.674 --> 23:32.842
- Did you find out anything?
- I made a couple of calls.

23:32.843 --> 23:34.677
So after the killer
was almost caught in Vienna,

23:34.678 --> 23:36.012
he took off, but he's not given up.

23:36.013 --> 23:37.680
So he's still looking
to unload the rock.

23:37.681 --> 23:40.183
Oh, he sure is and word is
after that close call,

23:40.184 --> 23:42.352
- he's desperate to sell.
- Well, we might have a suspect.

23:42.353 --> 23:43.786
Camille, look at this.

23:44.855 --> 23:46.422
Looks like the car
I saw the killer get into.

23:46.423 --> 23:48.024
- Is this the guy?
- Not him.

23:48.025 --> 23:49.926
- So we have the wrong car.
- This man!

23:49.927 --> 23:52.261
He's the one I saw.

23:52.262 --> 23:54.063
Well, it looks
like you found the killer.

23:54.064 --> 23:55.264
So who is he?

23:55.265 --> 23:57.066
And how do we catch him?

24:07.505 --> 24:08.639
According to Camille,

24:08.640 --> 24:10.340
this is definitely
the man that she saw.

24:10.341 --> 24:13.010
He's sure a dapper dresser.

24:13.011 --> 24:15.012
A real gentleman jewel thief.

24:15.013 --> 24:17.085
Dapper or not,
Camille can put him at hotel

24:17.086 --> 24:18.286
at the time of the murder.

24:18.287 --> 24:19.454
It's still not enough to nail him

24:19.455 --> 24:21.522
and certainly not enough
to make Greyson happy.

24:21.524 --> 24:24.592
- So what do we do?
- According to Nora's sources,

24:24.593 --> 24:27.028
our guy's desperate
to unload the diamond.

24:28.597 --> 24:29.864
So if he's looking for a buyer...

24:29.865 --> 24:31.499
We give him a buyer.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.369
I like where this is going.
So how do we get to him?

24:34.370 --> 24:36.604
Well, our mark was close enough

24:36.605 --> 24:39.040
to Mrs. Burns-Higgins
to borrow her car.

24:40.109 --> 24:42.176
And I may have a way
into that household.

24:47.716 --> 24:48.983
Mavis?

24:51.220 --> 24:53.888
Hi. I'm Trudy Clarke.
Thanks for coming.

24:53.889 --> 24:55.890
- Please have a seat.
- I don't have much time.

24:55.891 --> 24:58.059
I'm supposed to be out
shopping for the house.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.061
What's this about?
How do you know Shirley?

25:00.062 --> 25:02.630
I've known Shirley for ages.
She's my hairdresser.

25:02.631 --> 25:06.067
Shirley does the best
Marcel wave in town.

25:06.068 --> 25:07.402
(LAUGHING)

25:07.403 --> 25:09.404
Listen, I'm a private detective

25:09.405 --> 25:12.540
and I need some information
about this man.

25:12.541 --> 25:13.741
I believe he knows your employer,

25:13.742 --> 25:15.910
- Mrs. Burns-Higgins.
- I can't help you.

25:15.911 --> 25:17.812
I can't afford to lose my job.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.251
Shirley told me about
your mother getting sick.

25:23.252 --> 25:25.119
- I'm not taking your money.
- Take it.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.388
I know you don't earn a lot
and every bit helps.

25:28.424 --> 25:29.824
Are you sure nobody will find out?

25:29.825 --> 25:32.527
Anything you tell me is confidential.

25:35.431 --> 25:37.865
Shirley said you were straightforward.

25:39.602 --> 25:40.735
He's a guest at the house.

25:40.736 --> 25:42.603
His name's Count Johann.

25:42.605 --> 25:45.206
How does he know Mrs. Burns-Higgins?

25:45.207 --> 25:46.741
They met on a European river cruise

25:46.742 --> 25:49.377
a month ago.
She invited him to Toronto.

25:49.378 --> 25:51.846
- Where's he from?
- Supposedly Vienna,

25:51.847 --> 25:53.381
but I think he travels a lot.

25:53.382 --> 25:55.984
- Speaks a couple of languages.
- He's a worldly man.

25:56.886 --> 25:58.386
- Does he smoke?
- Yes.

25:58.387 --> 26:00.455
Some foreign cigarettes
that smell funny.

26:00.456 --> 26:02.123
Listen, I need to go.

26:02.124 --> 26:04.559
Mrs. Burns-Higgins
is throwing a garden party

26:04.560 --> 26:06.728
in honour of the Count
and the house is in a tizzy.

26:06.729 --> 26:09.831
- When's the party?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

26:15.371 --> 26:17.572
- So, can you do it or not?
- Tomorrow afternoon!

26:17.573 --> 26:18.806
You're not giving me enough time.

26:18.807 --> 26:20.074
Come on, Nora.
You're the perfect candidate.

26:20.075 --> 26:21.242
Cut the sweet talk.

26:21.243 --> 26:22.944
- I'm no performing monkey.
- Fine.

26:22.945 --> 26:24.412
- I'll get someone else to do it.
- Hold on!

26:24.413 --> 26:26.914
What's the role? Um...
Another brothel owner perhaps?

26:26.916 --> 26:28.249
No, it's something
much more difficult.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.684
You'd have to pretend to be my mother.

26:29.685 --> 26:31.352
Hold on. You and me?
Mother and daughter?

26:31.353 --> 26:33.087
Like I said, I'll get someone else.

26:33.088 --> 26:35.690
No, no. I'll do it.
It'll be my perfect swan song.

26:35.691 --> 26:37.759
Swan song? What, are you
leaving town or something?

26:37.760 --> 26:39.761
- Something.
- You care to elaborate?

26:39.762 --> 26:42.130
No. So what's the first step
in your grand plan?

26:42.131 --> 26:45.533
We need to set the bait.
Maybe Lipstick could help.

26:45.534 --> 26:47.201
I'll fire up the old typewriter.

26:47.202 --> 26:49.871
What did you have in mind? (CLICKING)

26:58.047 --> 26:59.714
- Cleopatra?
- What's wrong with that?

26:59.715 --> 27:01.549
- Too flowery.
- What?

27:01.550 --> 27:04.719
- What about Olivia?
- Everybody's a critic.

the Carolina.

Then he traded her
in for a newer model.

34:31.764 --> 34:34.232
Well, my mother's
most cherished possession

34:34.233 --> 34:35.900
was bought for her by another man.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.570
It just... it doesn't
sit right with him.

now is a good time to leave
so you can pack.

35:00.693 --> 35:03.628
- Seems I must go.
- What a shame.

35:04.864 --> 35:06.531

35:06.532 --> 35:08.700
From the sounds of it,

35:08.701 --> 35:10.435
there might be a small window
this evening.

- We don't have a fallback.
- There's always a fallback.

36:05.357 --> 36:07.358
We could break into his room
at Mrs. Burns-Higgins' house

36:07.359 --> 36:09.527
- and find the diamond.
- If he's onto to us,

Exactly.

37:20.032 --> 37:21.566
It's getting late. Where is Oscar?

37:22.701 --> 37:24.802
Well, seeing as you're in a hurry...

37:26.372 --> 37:27.805
Oscar!

37:30.042 --> 37:33.378
Oscar, meet Count Johann.

37:33.379 --> 37:36.414
I believe you may have
something to show me.

37:45.991 --> 37:47.625
His friend, the Antoinette.

37:49.161 --> 37:51.262
Oh! Oscar!

37:52.665 --> 37:55.833
You naughty boy! She is just gorgeous.

37:55.835 --> 37:56.868
How much are you asking?

37:56.869 --> 37:58.436
Shall we say...

37:59.839 --> 38:01.472
100 000$?

38:01.473 --> 38:03.841
Well, that seems reasonable.

38:03.843 --> 38:06.277
Camille! What do you think?

38:07.847 --> 38:10.348
That's him! That's the man I saw.

and I will slit her throat.

38:45.317 --> 38:47.051
Thank you! It's a speciality.

38:47.052 --> 38:48.987
This is likely the murder weapon.

38:48.988 --> 38:50.421
Very likely.

38:54.159 --> 38:55.426
Thanks for playing along.

38:56.328 --> 38:57.829
Well, it is my job.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.832
This should be a tricky one
to explain down at the station.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.373
I'm sure you'll think of something.

39:03.002 --> 39:04.869
Does anyone have any smelling salts?

39:04.870 --> 39:07.171
So, where's the diamond?

39:07.172 --> 39:08.339
If you don't mind, I sure would like

39:08.340 --> 39:09.874
one last look at that beauty.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.409
Check his pockets.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.611
Well, his right pocket.

39:17.850 --> 39:19.517
- It's gone.
- What?

39:19.518 --> 39:22.220
- Where is it?
- Where's Camille?

39:22.221 --> 39:24.122
She took off with the diamond.

39:25.024 --> 39:26.491
Try Hank's!

39:29.361 --> 39:31.696
So the lovebirds have flown the coop.

39:31.697 --> 39:33.131
Did you see that coming,
Camille and the diamond?

39:33.132 --> 39:34.298
Not for a second.

39:35.868 --> 39:38.536
Oh! Seems Mr. Sommers
has lost a daughter

39:38.537 --> 39:39.837
but found his horse.

39:47.544 --> 39:49.211
So it ends here, Frankie.

39:49.212 --> 39:51.413
I wish we could've put the past
behind us,

39:51.415 --> 39:53.883
but maybe we never can
and to tell you the truth,

39:53.884 --> 39:56.218
this mess was probably all my fault,

39:56.219 --> 39:57.219
that's if I'm being honest.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.989
Maybe in our next lifetime, huh?

40:00.891 --> 40:02.825
Still, it's been swell

40:04.061 --> 40:05.161
Nora.

40:08.565 --> 40:10.666
(KNOCKING)

40:11.735 --> 40:13.068
(KNOCKING)

40:13.070 --> 40:15.104
Yeah, no need to break it down!

40:15.105 --> 40:16.739
(KNOCKING)

40:16.740 --> 40:18.240
I'm coming.

40:18.241 --> 40:22.378
Bags are packed. I got
a train ticket out of town.

40:23.413 --> 40:24.914
Oh! Nice of you to see me off.

40:24.915 --> 40:26.415
Well, I wish you a good trip.

40:26.416 --> 40:29.251
- The hotel is most grateful.
- I'm sure you are.

40:29.252 --> 40:32.388
Not many of our guests pay
a year in advance.

40:33.423 --> 40:35.457
Well, isn't that something.

40:37.194 --> 40:41.297
Yes, well...
I look forward to your return.

40:49.372 --> 40:52.041
"I've bought you a little more time.

40:52.042 --> 40:55.477
Give it another year. Antoinette." Oh!

40:57.214 --> 41:01.417
Oh! Camille, you little minx!

41:07.390 --> 41:09.291
Get me Room Service.

41:12.229 --> 41:14.263
Thanks for bringing her home to me.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.232
Not that I need her now.

41:16.233 --> 41:18.400
I could retire if I wanted to.

41:18.401 --> 41:21.237
Thanks to Camille
and that new husband of hers.

41:21.238 --> 41:23.405
Aah...

41:23.406 --> 41:24.740
- Look at that!
- Oh my!

41:24.741 --> 41:26.375
Runs like a top!

41:26.376 --> 41:29.011
Debts paid off too.

41:29.012 --> 41:32.248
- Struck lucky, did she?
- Could say that.

41:32.249 --> 41:36.352
Wrote that she met a man,
a Viscount or some such.

41:36.353 --> 41:39.855
- Sounds like a fairy tale.
- It is at that.

41:39.856 --> 41:41.624
She's somewhere in Europe.

41:42.692 --> 41:44.426
I hope she's still going to church.

41:44.427 --> 41:46.362
I'm sure she's counting her blessings,

41:46.363 --> 41:47.830
wherever she is.

41:53.870 --> 41:56.205
Camille loved reading
those Judith Dawes adventures.

41:56.206 --> 41:57.706
And now she's living one on her own.

41:57.707 --> 42:00.042
Here we thought
she was just a farm girl.

42:00.043 --> 42:02.211
Just a farm girl, my ass!

42:02.212 --> 42:04.613
And you owe me for that dress
she took off in!

42:04.614 --> 42:06.582
It was expensive, so dig deep.

42:06.583 --> 42:07.883
Well, she was a quick learner.

42:07.884 --> 42:09.018
You got to give her that much.

42:09.019 --> 42:10.886
Oh, wasn't she just...
And I should've thought

42:10.887 --> 42:12.187
of nicking that stone myself!

42:12.189 --> 42:14.223
A gal's gotta do
what a gal's gotta do.

42:14.224 --> 42:15.858
Even if it means stealing a diamond?

42:15.859 --> 42:18.394
Isn't really stealing
if the diamond's already stolen?

42:18.395 --> 42:21.563
But how did Camille manage
to sell the Antoinette anyways?

42:21.565 --> 42:23.732
Oh! Guess who took off
with my little black book

42:23.733 --> 42:26.101
- full of all my fence contacts.
- Oh!

42:26.102 --> 42:27.236
- (LAUGHING)
- That's some nerve!

42:27.237 --> 42:28.904
Well, she learned from the best.

42:28.905 --> 42:30.606
I wonder where she is now.

42:30.607 --> 42:32.741
We got a special delivery.

42:32.742 --> 42:34.076
Real champagne.

42:34.077 --> 42:35.878
From France.

42:35.879 --> 42:37.279
That might answer your question, Nora.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.115
Oh! (LAUGHING)

42:40.116 --> 42:42.117
To Camille.

42:42.118 --> 42:43.185
What a gal!

42:43.186 --> 42:44.453
- (LAUGHING)
- Here you go.

42:45.655 --> 42:46.689
There you go.

42:46.690 --> 42:47.956
Thank you.

42:49.359 --> 42:50.693
So what happened to you leaving?

42:50.694 --> 42:52.194
Well...

42:52.195 --> 42:55.531
I thought this was
your perfect swan song.

42:55.532 --> 42:58.200
Oh, that, yeah!
Um... I've decided to...

42:58.201 --> 42:59.468
give it another year.

43:00.537 --> 43:01.704
A year?

43:01.705 --> 43:03.138
Why not?

43:04.207 --> 43:05.474
Why not?
