WEBVTT

00:02.367 --> 00:04.108
Yep. That's a predator.

00:04.551 --> 00:06.969
So, what... like, a coyote?

00:06.970 --> 00:09.476
Oh, no, no. That's a
bigger animal than that.

00:10.521 --> 00:11.804
How much bigger?

00:11.805 --> 00:13.762
That's bear scat.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.466
- Oh.
- See the turds' end?

00:15.467 --> 00:17.659
How they taper? Yep.

00:19.268 --> 00:22.497
I say that that's unfailingly

00:22.498 --> 00:25.644
the shit of a 500-pound
female black bear.

00:25.645 --> 00:27.123
Whoa.

00:27.124 --> 00:29.105
Do you own a firearm?

It's today!

Yay! Mwah.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.668
I love you. VoilÃ .

00:49.669 --> 00:51.321
Oh, my God.

00:51.322 --> 00:53.367
This is stunning.

00:53.368 --> 00:55.499
It's booze and health food.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.894
I love our day, hey,
I love our day, hey.

00:58.895 --> 01:01.549
I love our day, hey...

I love this.

01:03.552 --> 01:05.771
This is paradise here.

01:05.772 --> 01:08.077
We need our lady time.

01:08.078 --> 01:09.818
Bro.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.690
- Happy New Year.
- Har-loo!

01:11.691 --> 01:14.040
It's all happening!

01:16.086 --> 01:18.914
Ladies, Mama needs a drink!

01:18.915 --> 01:20.394
Ooh, I want a smoke, too.

01:20.395 --> 01:23.832
- Damn it. Hi, baby.
- Har-loo!

01:23.833 --> 01:26.487
Har-loo!

01:26.488 --> 01:28.794
- Menopause.
- I missed you, hon.

01:28.795 --> 01:31.710
- Ooh, here, have some very cheap wine.
- Please.

01:31.711 --> 01:33.407
- Kick it up my notches!
- My notches!

01:34.757 --> 01:36.062
I love bread.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.846
Is this thing on?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.543
- You want a Primo? Okay.
- Ah, yes, ma'am.

01:39.544 --> 01:40.936
- Yes, miss.
- Right, honey?

01:40.937 --> 01:42.938
Har-loo!

01:42.939 --> 01:45.288
Har-loo!

01:45.289 --> 01:47.943
- Oh, Tressa.
- Sam.

01:47.944 --> 01:50.665
It's okay.

01:52.101 --> 01:54.080
Aw...

01:54.081 --> 01:56.865
I was scared you wouldn't
come today because of me.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.340
I didn't want to miss the thing.

01:59.341 --> 02:00.913
And I meant what I said.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.958
- We're friends too long.
- Mmm.

02:02.959 --> 02:06.005
Besides, I like you better
as a friend than a client.

02:06.006 --> 02:08.529
Thank you?

02:08.530 --> 02:10.771
Pace car.

02:12.556 --> 02:14.666
Whoa.

02:14.667 --> 02:15.928
Here.

02:15.929 --> 02:18.191
- I've got you.
- Thank you, honey.

02:18.192 --> 02:20.976
- We're friends forever.
- My God.

02:20.977 --> 02:22.935
I don't like when that happens.

02:24.981 --> 02:26.895
Baby, yes. Come to Mama.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.897
She's in her element here.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.900
Your Royal Heiny. Mm, mm, mm.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.424
Wait a minute, is there
any vodka in this at all?

02:34.425 --> 02:36.992
You know I like more vodka than soda.

02:36.993 --> 02:38.646
My mother has Murray. I'm never leaving.

02:38.647 --> 02:40.648
I'm gonna let my mother raise
Murray. I'm staying here.

02:40.649 --> 02:43.825
Ida is so upset she couldn't be here.

02:43.826 --> 02:46.132
She was gonna fly in a day
early and everything,

02:46.133 --> 02:47.916
but then she got tickets to Springsteen.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.005
She did?

02:50.006 --> 02:52.051
How much do you want to bet
Ida got backstage passes?

02:52.052 --> 02:53.966
- Yeah.
- Magic.

02:53.967 --> 02:57.143
Show me the magic.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.798
"Is he, like, single? Is that...
or is he in a relationship?"

02:59.799 --> 03:02.017
She said, "No he's single
and he's straight.

03:02.018 --> 03:03.584
Wait, how old are your daughters?"

03:03.585 --> 03:05.020
- And I was like, "Bitch!"
- Bitch...

03:05.021 --> 03:06.587
Hello? Over here?

03:06.588 --> 03:09.242
Put your lips together and suck.

03:09.243 --> 03:12.027
I like when my kids say, "What
happened to your boobs?"

03:12.028 --> 03:14.900
- You! That's right.
- You, you little bastards.

03:14.901 --> 03:17.685
You have the maternity section
in your fucking closet.

03:17.686 --> 03:19.818
- Yes.
- Well, that, I'd go back to.

03:19.819 --> 03:21.907
Can I move in your pool house?

03:21.908 --> 03:23.909
It feels so good to get untense.

03:23.910 --> 03:25.021
- Yeah.
- Oh...

03:25.022 --> 03:27.216
L'chaim, l'chaim.

03:27.217 --> 03:29.088
- Thank you.
- Lala Land!

03:29.089 --> 03:31.069

- Lala Land.

- Well, get in here!

03:45.600 --> 03:48.471
It's so good. Come on.

03:48.472 --> 03:51.213
Do you use this thing a lot?

03:51.214 --> 03:54.521
- Yes. Every day.
- Oh.

03:54.522 --> 03:58.002
You guys have your drugs and
alcohol, I have my Jacuzzi.

03:58.003 --> 04:00.440
I'll get in if you turn off the lights.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.312
I think that's Mars.

04:03.313 --> 04:05.836
Ooh, Tressa, you still got good boobs.

04:05.837 --> 04:07.272
Thank you. Don't look, though.

04:07.273 --> 04:08.796
Do you want to hug naked in the Jacuzzi?

04:08.797 --> 04:11.015
- No, thank you.
- Just whip them around

04:11.016 --> 04:12.321
- a little a bit?
- No!

04:12.322 --> 04:13.583
Come on, Sam!

04:13.584 --> 04:15.846
Those aren't really school shirts.

04:15.847 --> 04:20.067
The communal nudity, I...

04:20.069 --> 04:22.592
Well, can you just watch
Yesenia for me, please?

04:22.593 --> 04:24.638
- Bro, she's right here.
- Can you pick her up?

04:24.639 --> 04:28.729
It's just so dark out
here and she's so tiny.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.471
She's just a little potato
chip tuna fish salad.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.038
Please?

04:34.039 --> 04:36.824
Thank you.

04:36.825 --> 04:38.608
This is the last food...

04:41.264 --> 04:43.526
I shop for groceries all the time.

04:43.527 --> 04:45.615
The boys are both teenagers
now, they need constant food.

04:45.616 --> 04:47.661
It's insane. It's my job.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.663
It's my actual job, groceries.

04:51.405 --> 04:53.536
Stop asking my ETA.

04:53.537 --> 04:55.843
You're supposed to be
taking care of our kids.

04:55.844 --> 04:58.106
- Leave me alone.
- Put down your phone.

04:58.107 --> 05:00.630
- I can't.
- I got to put my clothes back on.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.676
It's so cold. Aren't you freezing?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.765
- I'm hot all the time.
- You know, some people say

05:04.766 --> 05:06.549
don't take anything,

05:06.550 --> 05:09.204
and other people say you
have to take something,

05:09.205 --> 05:11.511
- otherwise, you'll get the bad thing.
- Right, right,

05:11.512 --> 05:13.513
- right, right, right.
- If you don't take,

05:13.514 --> 05:15.950
like, hormones or whatever.

05:15.951 --> 05:17.430
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Yes.

05:17.431 --> 05:18.909
- 'cause I'm just sweating.
- No.

05:18.910 --> 05:20.302
Try the Progesterone.

05:20.303 --> 05:22.130
It's plant-based, it works great.

05:22.131 --> 05:24.741
Literally, it's the only
reason I'm sane right now.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.700
So all you women have had kids,

05:26.701 --> 05:28.571
and that means you've had a
hormone in you that protects you

05:28.572 --> 05:30.617
as you get older. I
haven't had any kids.

05:30.618 --> 05:32.532
- What?
- So I'm at a higher risk for...

05:32.533 --> 05:35.404
Finally, a reason.

05:35.405 --> 05:37.192
I got a... I-I've got a
couple of hormones in me.

05:37.193 --> 05:38.015
That's something.

05:38.016 --> 05:39.974
No one else is on anything but me?

05:39.975 --> 05:41.541
Well, I'm on something,

05:41.542 --> 05:44.544
but not for that.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.241
Can I just say, the
hardest part about going

05:46.242 --> 05:48.765
through all of this is that you
realize, too, on top of it all,

05:48.766 --> 05:51.681
you no longer exist as a woman.

05:51.682 --> 05:53.683
You are like, literally
invisible to people.

05:53.684 --> 05:55.685
Oh, I love being invisible.

05:55.686 --> 05:57.948
It's like I have a superpower.
I can just run all my errands

05:57.949 --> 06:00.342
and go about my day and
nobody bothers me.

06:00.343 --> 06:02.562
But how about that you don't
realize how much juice

06:02.563 --> 06:05.478
you used to get from it?
That's what freaked me out.

06:05.479 --> 06:06.566
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.655
Like, that day I walked into Starbucks,

06:08.656 --> 06:11.788
and the two cute young chicks
were getting all the juice.

06:11.789 --> 06:15.554
And then I realized, I liked that juice.

06:15.555 --> 06:18.229
You've gone through a whole
day and nobody's, like,

06:18.230 --> 06:20.144
engaging with you, and
it's not just guys.

06:20.145 --> 06:22.930
- No. It's everybody.
- It's girls, too. It's like...

06:22.931 --> 06:25.498
I knew it. You guys, I
think that the problem is,

06:25.499 --> 06:28.413
is that nobody is talking to anybody.

06:28.414 --> 06:30.764
There has to be some
kind of outlet for women

06:30.765 --> 06:32.069
and-and people.

06:32.070 --> 06:34.681
Because we are all so busy.

06:34.682 --> 06:36.073
We have to compare notes, right?

06:36.074 --> 06:37.727
'Cause the pressure builds up,

06:37.728 --> 06:40.600
and this... This lets the pus out.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.428
- Gross.
- No, it's true. It's true, though.

06:43.429 --> 06:45.021
- It's true.
- People aren't sharing.

06:45.022 --> 06:46.170
Women don't talk to each other.

06:46.171 --> 06:48.433
- Mm-mm.
- Even Cadence Ford...

06:48.434 --> 06:50.871
The-the asshole robot mom

06:50.872 --> 06:53.438
at Duke's school... Like, needs her own

06:53.439 --> 06:57.225
come to Jesus moment where she,
like, reveals her inners

06:57.226 --> 07:00.837
and doesn't feel judged or picked on.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.056
Even her.

07:02.057 --> 07:04.101
I hate her so much.

07:04.102 --> 07:08.062
But even she needs to
do that with her own...

07:08.063 --> 07:09.542
type of people.

07:10.979 --> 07:13.197
I'm sure there's some around.

07:13.198 --> 07:16.461
I mean, women have to, we have to.

07:16.462 --> 07:19.421
- We owe it to the future.
- Well, we just,

07:19.422 --> 07:22.076
- We owe it to now.
- We got to do this more.

07:22.077 --> 07:24.731
This is so, so important.

07:24.732 --> 07:26.505
Yeah.

07:26.506 --> 07:28.874
Lala? Why are all the lights off?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.468
Can't see anything, Lala.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.653
Hey, there you are, little
girl. There you go.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.785
Oh...

07:35.786 --> 07:38.048
Hello.

07:38.049 --> 07:39.376
- Oh, hey. Really.
- Hello.

07:39.377 --> 07:40.668
What were you talking about?

07:40.669 --> 07:41.922
Were you talking about your men?

07:43.838 --> 07:46.666
- Hey.
- Guys, this is, um,

07:46.667 --> 07:49.233
Tom's oldest and dearest friend Stan.

07:49.234 --> 07:52.522
- Hi.
- How was the game?

07:52.523 --> 07:54.678
We left early. Stripling
got lit up for seven

07:54.679 --> 07:56.017
in the bottom of the fifth.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.677
Hey, did you guys want some food?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.287
Uh, we had Dodger Dogs.

07:59.288 --> 08:02.105
- Was traffic bad?
- Oh. It was awful.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.623
I mean, you know, this is
the reason I left L.A.

08:04.624 --> 08:08.731
You know, the smog, the
traffic, the earthquakes.

08:08.732 --> 08:11.299
Northridge still wakes me up
in the middle of the night.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.345
I'm telling you, the
rude people flip you off

08:14.346 --> 08:16.609
and then drive away. No accountability.

08:16.610 --> 08:18.741
Mary Jane.

08:18.742 --> 08:20.908
Why are you clearing? Are we done?

08:20.909 --> 08:22.615
Oh, you're not done? Oh, I'll...

08:22.616 --> 08:24.387
I'll put out more plates.
I thought we were done.

08:24.388 --> 08:27.489
Uh, we don't need new plates.
We pretty much just sat down.

08:27.490 --> 08:30.492
No, hon. Here, I-I'll
put out more plates.

08:30.493 --> 08:33.883
No, it's okay. Forget
it. We can be done.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.509
Oh, I have dessert.

08:36.510 --> 08:38.326
- Who wants dessert?
- Oh, yes. Yes, me, please.

08:38.327 --> 08:40.633
- Are we gonna watch the thing?
- Yes, that's why we're here.

08:40.634 --> 08:41.981
- Come on.
- Hey.

08:42.770 --> 08:45.202
What were you guys
talking about tonight?

08:45.203 --> 08:46.900
Sex?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.162
Hmm?

08:49.443 --> 08:51.644
- You look drunk. Ha-ha.
- Yeah, you think so, Tom?

08:53.777 --> 08:55.778
And you, Sammy.

08:55.779 --> 08:57.388
Are you?

08:57.389 --> 08:58.989
Just a little?

09:00.610 --> 09:02.634
Ha-ha.

09:05.202 --> 09:06.682
Night, girls.

09:08.205 --> 09:10.532
- I'll have dessert.
- Yes.

09:10.533 --> 09:12.752
I thanked Tom for letting us be here

09:12.753 --> 09:14.841
and that it means a lot

09:14.842 --> 09:15.842
and it's really nice.

09:15.843 --> 09:16.799
Why?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.888
Uh, 'cause it's his house.

09:18.889 --> 09:21.978
No, it's not. It's Lala's house, too.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.503
He shouldn't even be here.
He left the game early.

09:24.504 --> 09:26.026
He could've gone someplace else.

09:26.027 --> 09:27.460
That's disgusting.

09:27.461 --> 09:28.985
What?

09:28.986 --> 09:31.417
Yeah, we've been planning
this for months.

09:31.418 --> 09:33.356
Ida was gonna fly in.

09:35.416 --> 09:37.037
Hey, Tom!

09:37.038 --> 09:38.995
You want some ice cream and fruit?

09:38.996 --> 09:40.867
Jesus Christ, don't offer him dessert.

09:40.868 --> 09:42.564
What are you doing?

09:42.565 --> 09:44.784
I know, right? I know.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.047
It's, like, this thing I
do, where I'm like, "Ah."

09:47.048 --> 09:50.050
Yeah, you, like, become, like,
some kind of weird geisha.

09:50.051 --> 09:51.632
Are you serious?

09:51.633 --> 09:53.444
I am serious.

09:53.445 --> 09:55.795
Can't you just ask him
to leave or something?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.362
No, he doesn't have to go anywhere.

09:58.363 --> 10:01.148
I'm sorry, but I love my husband.

10:01.149 --> 10:04.020
So, if you have a problem
with him staying here,

10:04.021 --> 10:05.892
then you get the fuck out.

10:05.893 --> 10:08.590
- Oh. Okay...
- Uh-uh-uh. Hey, hey, hey.

10:08.591 --> 10:10.397
Come on, guys.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.203
Tress,

10:13.204 --> 10:17.013
you want to help me set up Sam's movie?

10:18.623 --> 10:20.907
Oh.

10:20.908 --> 10:23.431
Are we still doing that?

10:28.894 --> 10:31.331
I'm a little drunk.

10:34.465 --> 10:36.444
Am I wrong?

10:36.445 --> 10:38.707
It's okay.

10:38.708 --> 10:40.709
Sorry. But I'm not.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.624
Sorry.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.301
Mm.

10:51.322 --> 10:52.866
Hello!

10:52.867 --> 10:53.867
It's just me.

10:53.868 --> 10:55.108
- Hi.
- Hi, Gran.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.784
You look really nice.

10:57.785 --> 10:59.916
Ah, thank you, Her Nibs.

10:59.917 --> 11:02.092
You want some breakfast, Phil?

11:02.093 --> 11:03.093
Um, I've eaten.

11:03.094 --> 11:04.529
I'm going to an Irish wake today.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.140
It's day two.

11:06.141 --> 11:07.663
What's an Irish wake?

11:07.664 --> 11:08.969
It's a wake where they put the body

11:08.970 --> 11:10.884
out on a table and
there's, like, candles

11:10.885 --> 11:12.581
and everybody sings and dances

11:12.582 --> 11:15.018
and loses their mind and
gets shithouse drunk.

11:15.019 --> 11:17.565
Well.

11:21.961 --> 11:23.461
Mom!

11:23.462 --> 11:25.507
Grandpa's in my room!

11:25.508 --> 11:26.853
But it's really nice, because it goes on

11:26.854 --> 11:28.510
- for, like, four days.
- Mom, Mom, it's Grandpa.

11:28.511 --> 11:29.773
It's kind of like shivah,
and the body's never alone.

11:29.774 --> 11:31.469
Grandpa's in my room! Mom!

11:31.470 --> 11:33.776
He is certainly not.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.823
He's in a chest at the foot of my bed.

11:36.824 --> 11:38.955
What?

11:38.956 --> 11:40.721
What do you mean?

11:40.722 --> 11:43.307
All this nonsense. It's so much fuss.

11:43.308 --> 11:45.506
I just had him cremated.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.398
I'm not even sure

11:47.399 --> 11:48.835
why I've kept his ashes.

11:48.836 --> 11:50.401
More things underfoot.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.056
Mom, I saw him.

11:53.057 --> 11:56.059
He's here. He's here right now.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.104
Okay, baby, calm down.

11:57.105 --> 11:58.627
Mom!

11:58.628 --> 12:00.519
Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.446
- Wait, let me turn down the burner.
- Wait, I want to see.

12:03.447 --> 12:06.353
Hang on!

12:14.231 --> 12:17.669
Do any of you want to
join me for the wake?

12:17.670 --> 12:19.870
It's ever so much fun.

12:22.554 --> 12:25.045
Well, I'm off.

12:25.046 --> 12:28.091
There's nobody here
except Mandy Patinkin.

12:28.092 --> 12:30.006
I'm not lying!

12:30.007 --> 12:31.965
- I know, honey.
- No!

12:31.966 --> 12:34.315
Grandpa was sitting right there,

12:34.316 --> 12:35.751
in a brown suit, and he asked me

12:35.752 --> 12:38.014
what was up with my friend Django's mom.

12:38.015 --> 12:39.146
Dude, that's a big buttprint.

12:39.147 --> 12:41.040
Duke couldn't have made that.

12:42.215 --> 12:43.411
Huh.

12:43.412 --> 12:45.652
I need my dog.

12:53.139 --> 12:56.903
Mom, I told you. There is
something in the house.

12:56.904 --> 12:58.687
It's not a joke.

12:58.688 --> 13:01.452
You never listen.

13:07.023 --> 13:08.001
Thank you for

13:08.002 --> 13:10.003
seeing me over your lunch.

13:10.004 --> 13:11.221
Not a problem.

13:11.222 --> 13:13.812
It sounded urgent. So...

13:15.640 --> 13:17.184
Well, how are the pills working out?

13:17.185 --> 13:18.576
You get any sleep?

13:18.577 --> 13:20.230
Oh. Great.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.364
They're terrific.

13:23.365 --> 13:24.800
Also,

13:24.801 --> 13:29.152
I maybe forgot to start taking them.

13:29.153 --> 13:31.024
Okay.

13:31.025 --> 13:33.026
Well, that seemed like
an important reason

13:33.027 --> 13:35.289
for coming here.

13:35.290 --> 13:37.944
- Yeah.
- Is this about...

13:37.945 --> 13:39.446
Okay.

13:40.491 --> 13:41.469
Okay.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.297
Fine.

13:43.298 --> 13:44.951
Um...

13:44.952 --> 13:47.475
Okay, I have this thing.

13:47.476 --> 13:48.737
- Thing?
- Yeah.

13:48.738 --> 13:49.956
There's this thing in the house.

13:49.957 --> 13:51.522
It's, like, um...

13:51.523 --> 13:52.741
a presence,

13:52.742 --> 13:53.742
I guess?

13:53.743 --> 13:55.222
What-What do you mean, like a ghost?

13:56.485 --> 13:58.181
Sure. Okay.

13:58.182 --> 13:59.443
Yes.

13:59.444 --> 14:02.098
And it's driving my kids insane,

14:02.099 --> 14:03.447
which is not that hard to do.

14:03.448 --> 14:05.623
I mean, they're actually terrified.

14:05.624 --> 14:07.930
And I usually can keep
a good handle on it.

14:07.931 --> 14:12.152
But this otherworldly shit
is a bit too much for me.

14:12.153 --> 14:13.631
I mean, I'm a single lady.

14:13.632 --> 14:16.069
Only one realm at a time,
you know what I mean?

14:16.070 --> 14:20.421
Okay, well, I'm not a-a
children's specialist.

14:20.422 --> 14:24.077
What I want is, can you just
come over to my house...

14:24.078 --> 14:27.167
and lie to them?

14:27.168 --> 14:29.734
- You want me to lie to them?
- My kids

14:29.735 --> 14:33.086
can't be reasoned with on any
kind of normal human level.

14:33.087 --> 14:35.088
So, I don't know,

14:35.089 --> 14:37.525
I just thought maybe you could...

14:37.526 --> 14:40.789
come over and pretend to be a medium

14:40.790 --> 14:44.140
and say that you sense
that the spirits are angry

14:44.141 --> 14:47.143
because they're mean to their mom or...

14:47.144 --> 14:49.319
whatever.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.321
Okay.

14:51.322 --> 14:54.324
Okay, that is an insane idea,

14:54.325 --> 14:56.326
and I don't know why you'd
come to me about it.

14:56.327 --> 14:58.154
Isn't that what you do...

14:58.155 --> 15:00.809
Talk people down from the
made-up shit in their heads?

15:00.810 --> 15:04.595
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that, Sam.

15:04.596 --> 15:08.164
And, you know what, this whole
game, it's kind of a, uh...

15:08.165 --> 15:10.688
it's kind of a bullshit
move on your part.

15:10.689 --> 15:11.776
Oh.

15:11.777 --> 15:13.474
Uh, what?

15:13.475 --> 15:16.239
Why did you text me when
you were out of town?

15:17.762 --> 15:19.480
Why'd you text me when you were away?

15:19.481 --> 15:20.524
I don't know.

15:20.525 --> 15:21.525
Yes, you do.

15:21.526 --> 15:22.700
Jesus, who cares?

15:22.701 --> 15:24.354
- I just texted you...
- I care.

15:24.355 --> 15:26.336
I care, Sam, and you know it.

15:29.034 --> 15:32.710
I'm not gonna lie to your kids
the first time I meet them.

15:32.711 --> 15:35.409
And if you were trying to
sabotage this whole thing...

15:35.410 --> 15:37.280
Whatever's happening
between you and me...

15:37.281 --> 15:38.542
Uh, then mission accomplished.

15:38.543 --> 15:40.066
And, uh...

15:40.067 --> 15:41.328
I really...

15:41.329 --> 15:43.330
I actually do have a-a busy afternoon,

15:43.331 --> 15:46.356
so, uh, if that's it...

15:47.444 --> 15:49.881
Oh.

15:50.969 --> 15:53.296
Yeah.

15:53.297 --> 15:55.582
Okay.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.305
Okay.

16:02.306 --> 16:05.331
I'll just... I'll leave, I guess.

16:07.464 --> 16:10.119
I...

16:11.598 --> 16:14.035
Um...

16:16.125 --> 16:18.910
I'm gonna go.

16:25.786 --> 16:28.224
I don't really know how to do this.

16:30.487 --> 16:32.248
Well,

16:32.249 --> 16:35.033
I don't either, but...

16:35.034 --> 16:38.147
maybe I could help you out.

16:47.939 --> 16:50.484
Obviously, I'm not gonna
charge you for this session.

16:50.485 --> 16:52.204
Mm.

16:56.513 --> 16:58.492
Is that turkey?

16:58.493 --> 17:00.842
Mm-hmm. - Did you eat the whole pickle?

17:00.843 --> 17:02.736
- Not yet.
- Okay, good.

17:24.432 --> 17:27.173
You know, kid...

17:27.174 --> 17:29.479
whatever fathers say to their daughters

17:29.480 --> 17:31.481
about their love lives...

17:32.614 --> 17:34.310
...it's toxic.

17:34.311 --> 17:35.442
All of it.

17:35.443 --> 17:37.618
A bullshit bunch of fear

17:37.619 --> 17:39.837
that's projected onto young women.

17:39.838 --> 17:41.404
So you know what?

17:41.405 --> 17:43.493
I'm not gonna say a thing to you

17:43.494 --> 17:45.147
about what just happened in there.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.845
- Okay.
- That shrink, though...

17:47.846 --> 17:49.891
he was kind of adorable.

17:49.892 --> 17:51.414
Excuse me?

17:51.415 --> 17:53.460
I mean, if I ever swung
that way. You know.

17:53.461 --> 17:55.636
Hey, back in the '70s...

17:55.637 --> 17:57.986
things got a little blurry.

17:57.987 --> 18:00.098
Whole years, actually.

18:01.404 --> 18:04.427
Oh, come on, lighten up! Kid!

18:04.428 --> 18:07.474
You should be laughing, okay?

18:07.475 --> 18:10.456
That was funny. Jesus, so serious.

18:48.531 --> 18:50.021
Hey, mister.

18:53.971 --> 18:55.667
You know what those are?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.365
Comics?

18:57.366 --> 18:59.172
Mm-hmm. See that?

19:00.739 --> 19:02.413
Murray Fox.

19:02.414 --> 19:04.415
- That's Grandpa.
- Mm-hmm.

19:04.416 --> 19:06.330
He wrote it?

19:06.331 --> 19:08.550
He wrote all of these.

19:08.551 --> 19:10.291
All of those.

19:12.946 --> 19:14.643
Hot Knives.

19:14.644 --> 19:16.862
The Martian Who Loved Me.

19:16.863 --> 19:19.343
- What's that?
- This...

19:19.344 --> 19:21.673
is his word ball.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.567
Whenever Grandpa would get stuck,

19:25.568 --> 19:30.180
he would take this, and
he would spin this around

19:30.181 --> 19:34.663
and look for words that
would inspire him.

19:34.664 --> 19:36.383
- Can I try?
- Yes.

19:39.473 --> 19:41.757
Read one... one to me.

19:41.758 --> 19:43.193
What does...

19:43.194 --> 19:46.152
"in-effa-ble" mean?

19:46.153 --> 19:48.416
Like, uh...

19:48.417 --> 19:50.722
something that...

19:50.723 --> 19:53.421
you can't describe with words.

19:53.422 --> 19:55.161
Isn't that cool?

19:55.162 --> 19:56.403
Yeah.

20:03.715 --> 20:07.066
Did your dad leave you
when you were little, too?

20:09.503 --> 20:12.396
Honey, my dad didn't leave me.

20:12.397 --> 20:15.007
He had a heart attack.

20:15.008 --> 20:17.401
Remember? We talked about it.

20:17.402 --> 20:19.011
Okay.

20:19.012 --> 20:20.839
Was he old?

20:20.840 --> 20:22.580
No, not really.

20:22.581 --> 20:24.518
How old was he?

20:25.606 --> 20:27.869
He was almost 50.

20:28.957 --> 20:30.632
Aren't you almost fif...

20:30.633 --> 20:32.590
Shah.

20:32.591 --> 20:34.853
Shi-shi-shah.

20:36.552 --> 20:38.640
Do you miss him?

20:40.556 --> 20:42.426
Not all the time.

20:42.427 --> 20:44.646
Sometimes.

20:44.647 --> 20:46.366
I miss him today.

20:48.063 --> 20:50.414
Hang on.

20:56.202 --> 20:58.224
Remind me that story about, uh, Marion.

20:58.225 --> 20:59.617
Oh, the one a few weeks ago?

20:59.618 --> 21:01.619
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right. Well...

21:01.620 --> 21:04.187
- Is that...?
- Mm-hmm.

21:05.842 --> 21:07.669
Who's the other voice?

21:07.670 --> 21:09.061
- Who do you think?
- Marion was

21:09.062 --> 21:10.585
- teaching you to make an egg?
- Uh-huh.

21:10.586 --> 21:12.674
What? No. No.

21:12.675 --> 21:14.632
What do you mean, no?

21:14.633 --> 21:17.113
I was probably around your age there.

21:17.114 --> 21:19.071
You sound weird.

21:20.335 --> 21:22.553
- You sound weird!
- No. Oh, okay.

21:22.554 --> 21:24.555
- You sound weird! Take it back!
- No! Stop! Stop!

21:24.556 --> 21:26.209
Take it back.

21:26.210 --> 21:28.646
- I take back nothing.
- Take it back. Take it back.

21:28.647 --> 21:29.778
I take back nothing.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.307
- You gotta write it down.
- I don't write it down.

21:37.308 --> 21:38.526
You have to write it down.

21:38.527 --> 21:39.570
With these things, I tell you,

21:39.571 --> 21:40.919
- I know, I know.
- Got to keep a journal.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.312
Okay, I will, I will.

21:46.818 --> 21:49.363
Whether God exists or not,

21:49.364 --> 21:52.583
it doesn't make any difference.

21:52.584 --> 21:54.716
The difference is, you've got to do life

21:54.717 --> 21:57.719
believing in somebody or something.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.591
You have to have faith in them.

22:00.592 --> 22:04.029
If they let you down for any reason,

22:04.030 --> 22:06.031
well, that's the way it is.

22:06.032 --> 22:08.860
But I just take life as it comes.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.732
Comes and goes...

22:38.891 --> 22:40.501
That's definitely in!

22:40.502 --> 22:42.503
I'm not gonna say it.

22:42.504 --> 22:44.528
Fine. I'll say it.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.516
Monkey?

23:28.485 --> 23:30.551
Oh...

23:30.552 --> 23:32.640
Mandy.

23:49.658 --> 23:51.049
Shit.

24:07.741 --> 24:09.743
Oh.

24:32.831 --> 24:34.658
Whew!

24:40.687 --> 24:42.187
Whew.

24:58.836 --> 25:00.641
Mm.
