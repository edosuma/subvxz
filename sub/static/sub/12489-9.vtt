WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:08.109
BUT IT'S YOUR TURN.
NO, I DON'T WANT TO.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.440
SHH!

00:09.440 --> 00:12.283
AVERY, I AM YOUR MOTHER.
DON'T SHUSH ME, IT'S--

00:12.283 --> 00:14.545
IT'S OKAY.
SHE'S EXPRESSING HERSELF.

00:14.545 --> 00:18.119
SHH!
AVERY, I AM YOUR FATHER.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.552
GUYS, DON'T WAKE UP STAN.
I THINK HE'S SICK.

00:21.552 --> 00:23.724
HE WON'T COME WHEN I CALL
AND ALL HE DOES IS LAY AROUND

00:23.724 --> 00:26.597
IN A POOL OF HIS OWN DROOL,
BREATHING THROUGH HIS MOUTH.

00:26.597 --> 00:29.029
ARE YOU DESCRIBING
STAN OR TYLER?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.532
STAN'S ALSO NOT EATING.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.033
WELL, THAT IS NOT TYLER.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.035
HE'S UP IN BED RIGHT NOW
TRYING TO GNAW THROUGH

00:35.035 --> 00:37.508
A PACKAGE
OF FROZEN FISH STICKS.

00:37.508 --> 00:41.812
I'VE FOUND SEVERAL DISEASES
THAT MATCH STAN'S SYMPTOMS.
THEY'RE--

00:41.812 --> 00:45.346
UH, ACTUALLY, SWEETIE,
LET'S NOT DON'T GET INTO THIS
IN FRONT OF YOUR MOTHER;

00:45.346 --> 00:49.220
SHE'S A BIT, LET'S SAY,
PRONE TO SUGGESTION.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.521
I AM NOT.

00:50.521 --> 00:52.183
OH, I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN.

00:52.183 --> 00:54.185
IF SOMEONE EVEN
MENTIONS A SNEEZE,

00:54.185 --> 00:56.056
SUDDENLY YOU HAVE TO SNEEZE.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.589
THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL
AND I RESENT THE ACCUSATION.

00:58.589 --> 00:59.590
( sneezes )

01:01.832 --> 01:03.194
THE ROOM IS VERY DUSTY.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.396
I'M NOT SUGGESTIBLE,
I'M A BAD DUSTER.

01:05.396 --> 01:09.140
I'VE NARROWED STAN'S DIAGNOSIS
DOWN TO THREE POSSIBILITIES.

01:09.140 --> 01:12.573
LANGUORTOSIS IS COMMON
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.575
THE PRIMARY SYMPTOM
IS LETHARGY,

01:14.575 --> 01:16.747
BUT IT ALSO COMES WITH
CHILLS AND A DRY THROAT.

01:16.747 --> 01:22.513
( shivers and coughs )
I'M FINE.

01:22.513 --> 01:25.716
BUT STAN DOESN'T HAVE
CHILLS OR A DRY THROAT,

01:25.716 --> 01:28.759
SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
DROOPDACOCCUS.

01:28.759 --> 01:30.421
"THE DROOPS,"
AS THEY ARE CALLED,

01:30.421 --> 01:32.423
ALSO GIVE YOU SHARP PAIN
BEHIND THE LEFT EYE.

01:32.423 --> 01:33.594
OW.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.596
OH, UH, I THINK
IT'S THE RIGHT EYE.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.797
OW.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.629
OH, I GUESS IT
COULD BE EITHER EYE.

01:38.629 --> 01:40.201
OR IT COULD BE BOTH.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.833
OH!

01:42.833 --> 01:45.206
BUT I DON'T THINK
STAN HAS THAT,

01:45.206 --> 01:48.379
SO THE OTHER POSSIBILITY
WOULD BE K-9-FATIGATION.

01:48.379 --> 01:52.213
IT MAKES YOU TIRED, BUT IT
ALSO COMES WITH A TERRIBLE ITCH.

01:54.485 --> 01:55.846
MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?

01:55.846 --> 01:59.590
I'M FINE. I'M NOT EXPERIENCING
ANY SYMPTOMS. I'M FINE.

01:59.590 --> 02:01.392
I REALLY THINK
WE SHOULD CALL THE VET, THOUGH.

02:01.392 --> 02:02.853
YES, GO CALL THE VET.

02:02.853 --> 02:05.626
OH!

02:05.626 --> 02:07.858
FINE. FINER THAN FINE.
THIS SWEATER IS WOOL.

02:07.858 --> 02:09.530
IT'S COTTON.
IT'S WOOL!

02:09.530 --> 02:12.233
♪♪

02:29.880 --> 02:32.423
I KNOW THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH STAN!

02:32.423 --> 02:34.555
THAT VET DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT!

02:34.555 --> 02:36.657
HER WALL
IS LINED WITH DIPLOMAS.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.888
SO IS YOURS!

02:39.230 --> 02:40.391
I'M SORRY.

02:40.391 --> 02:41.532
I JUST KNOW MY DOG,

02:41.532 --> 02:43.494
AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON.

02:43.494 --> 02:45.165
WELL, THE DOCTOR
DID MENTION DEPRESSION.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.367
WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.839
( whimpering )

02:48.839 --> 02:50.771
AW. LOOK AT HIM.

02:50.771 --> 02:54.345
HE CERTAINLY LOOKS DEPRESSED.
IT'S SO SAD.

02:54.345 --> 02:57.348
( sighs )

02:57.348 --> 03:01.912
THAT'S SAD, TOO,
BUT FOR A DIFFERENT REASON.

03:01.912 --> 03:03.914
WELL, STAN
HAS BEEN DOING THINGS

03:03.914 --> 03:07.318
THAT DEPRESSED DOGS DO,
LIKE PEEING IN THE HOUSE.

03:07.318 --> 03:10.791
I'M GONNA TAKE
MY LARGE WATER BOTTLE
AND GO LIE DOWN.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.527
I BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

03:16.527 --> 03:18.529
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT STAN.

03:18.529 --> 03:21.832
A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT MOM,
BUT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT STAN.

03:21.832 --> 03:25.406
HE'LL BE FINE. MOM AND DAD
DON'T SEEM THAT WORRIED.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.339
YEAH, BECAUSE THEY
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW BAD IT IS.

03:28.339 --> 03:30.641
WE CAN'T EVEN TELL THEM
THE WORST PART--

03:30.641 --> 03:33.514
THAT STAN HAS STOPPED TALKING!

03:33.514 --> 03:34.815
ARE WE SURE HE EVER TALKED?

03:34.815 --> 03:37.848
I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE
A VERY ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

03:37.848 --> 03:41.392
BUT I DON'T. EVERY NIGHT
I HAVE THE SAME EXACT DREAM.

03:41.392 --> 03:44.425
A LITTLE OLD RUSSIAN WOMAN
YELLS AT ME TO EAT MY SOUP.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.756
THAT'S PROBABLY MY FAULT.

03:45.756 --> 03:47.428
EVERY NIGHT I COME
INTO YOUR ROOM AND SAY,

03:47.428 --> 03:51.262
( Russian accent )
"EAT YOUR SOUP! EAT YOUR SOUP!"

03:51.262 --> 03:53.233
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.467
TOLD YOU, I HAVE
A VERY ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

03:56.467 --> 04:00.541
GUYS, FORGET THE SOUP.
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON STAN.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.414
AND I'M GOING TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

04:03.414 --> 04:07.348
HEY, WE LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING
AND WE'RE REALLY WORRIED.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.819
PLEASE, TALK TO US.

04:08.819 --> 04:10.481
WHAT'S WRONG, BUDDY?

04:10.481 --> 04:12.423
MAYBE HE CAN'T HEAR US.

04:12.423 --> 04:15.726
WHAT'S WRONG, BUDDY?!

04:15.726 --> 04:17.758
WORKS WITH GRANDPA.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.870
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY WOULD STAN STOP TALKING?

04:29.870 --> 04:32.573
MAYBE HE STOPPED TALKING WHEN
HE STARTED GETTING DEPRESSED.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.905
EVERYBODY CONCENTRATE.
WHEN DID THIS ALL BEGIN?

04:34.905 --> 04:36.577
WELL, WHEN WE ALL
MOVED IN TOGETHER,

04:36.577 --> 04:38.379
MOM AND DAD THOUGHT A DOG
WOULD HELP US BOND.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.484
NO, DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN
STAN STARTED ACTING STRANGE?

04:43.484 --> 04:44.815
OH, THAT!

04:44.815 --> 04:47.588
YEAH, LAST TUESDAY
AT TWELVE AFTER FOUR.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.921
I JUST HAD
THE WORLD'S GREATEST DAY
WORKING AT THE FOOD TRUCK.

04:50.921 --> 04:53.324
YOU MET A GIRL?
BETTER!

04:53.324 --> 04:54.825
YOU MET A GIRL
WITH FEET MADE OF BACON?

04:54.825 --> 04:57.598
I THOUGHT BACON FOOT
WAS JUST A LEGEND!

04:57.598 --> 04:58.899
THERE IS NO BACON FOOT.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.871
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THERE'S NO HAM-SQUATCH.

05:00.871 --> 05:03.874
I HAD A GREAT DAY
'CAUSE I GOT MOM TO HIRE

05:03.874 --> 05:06.777
THE FOOD TRUCK TO CATER
CHLOE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY!

05:06.777 --> 05:08.339
THIRTY KIDS EATING TACOS!

05:08.339 --> 05:12.513
OH, THERE'S GONNA BE LOOSE MEAT
ALL OVER THE FLOOR!

05:12.513 --> 05:14.985
YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS FOOD TRUCK THING.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.518
HEY, ONE DAY,
I'LL HAVE MY OWN TRUCK

05:17.518 --> 05:18.819
AND I'LL DRIVE
AROUND THE COUNTRY

05:18.819 --> 05:20.521
AND NEVER LOOK BACK!

05:20.521 --> 05:22.693
EXCEPT FOR WHEN
I'M BACKING OUT OF A SPACE,

05:22.693 --> 05:24.825
OR BACKING INTO A SPACE,
OR CHANGING LANES.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.899
I'M A FREE SPIRIT
BUT A RESPONSIBLE DRIVER.

05:28.899 --> 05:30.561
DON'T WORRY.

05:30.561 --> 05:33.704
I'VE NOT FORGOTTEN
MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

05:33.704 --> 05:35.906
LEFTOVERS!

05:35.906 --> 05:38.338
( chuckles )
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE!

05:38.338 --> 05:41.842
GRILL SCRAPINGS
AND FRYER GRISTLE.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.075
AND SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE A BEAK.

05:45.075 --> 05:47.448
NO, THANKS.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.879
OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE ALWAYS HUNGRY.

05:48.879 --> 05:51.552
IT'S GOOD.
LOOK HOW GOOD IT IS.

05:51.552 --> 05:55.856
IT'S SO GOOD! ( barks )

05:57.458 --> 05:59.460
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH STAN.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.432
REALLY? WITH STAN?

06:04.935 --> 06:10.701
I WANT GRILL SCRAPINGS
AND FRYER GRISTLE AND SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE A BEAK!

06:10.701 --> 06:12.703
THAT WASN'T
THE POINT OF THE STORY.

06:12.703 --> 06:14.805
IT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS.

06:14.805 --> 06:17.948
WHY WOULDN'T HE EAT?
THAT'S NOT LIKE HIM.

06:17.948 --> 06:20.811
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST
NOTICED SOMETHING STRANGE.

06:20.811 --> 06:22.152
I WAS IN THE FAMILY ROOM...

06:25.486 --> 06:28.459
OH, HEY, DAD. WHAT'S UP?

06:28.459 --> 06:30.991
APPARENTLY YOU.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.993
ARE THOSE STILTS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:32.993 --> 06:36.927
JUST, UH, STRETCHING MY LEGS.

06:36.927 --> 06:39.169
( laughs )
CLASSIC STILT-WALKER JOKE.

06:39.169 --> 06:42.703
SWEETHEART, IF THIS
IS ABOUT WANTING TO JOIN
THE BASKETBALL TEAM,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.705
YOU MAY GRAB
A LOT OF REBOUNDS

06:44.705 --> 06:47.007
BUT YOU ARE NEVER
GONNA GET BACK ON D.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.580
I'M RESEARCHING COLLEGES.

06:49.580 --> 06:52.583
AND YES, I KNOW
I'M ONLY IN SIXTH GRADE,

06:52.583 --> 06:55.085
BUT I PLAN ON
SKIPPING NINTH AND TENTH.

06:55.085 --> 06:57.117
BY STEPPING OVER THEM?

06:57.117 --> 07:02.493
THE COLLEGES WANT
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
THAT ARE, WELL, UNIQUE.

07:02.493 --> 07:04.955
BETWEEN CLASSES, CHEERLEADING,
AND YOUR VOLUNTEER WORK,

07:04.955 --> 07:06.997
DON'T YOU THINK YOU HAVE
ENOUGH BALLS IN THE AIR?

07:06.997 --> 07:09.159
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT'S MY BIG FINISH.

07:09.159 --> 07:11.031
OH.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.534
YOU KNOW, I COULD DO THIS
FOR CHLOE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
IF YOU WANT.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.035
OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.037
YOU KNOW, WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE,
CAN YOU GRAB THAT OLD BALLOON?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.769
OH, YEAH.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.844
"HAPPY NINTH BIRTHDAY, TY TY"?

07:23.844 --> 07:28.118
OH, YAY! YOU FOUND MY BALLOON!

07:28.118 --> 07:33.083
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS HE'LL HAVE
THE SAME REACTION TO THE BALLOON
THAT SAYS, "HAPPY FORTIETH."

07:37.057 --> 07:39.860
STAN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO MY COLLEGE CATALOGS?!

07:39.860 --> 07:41.031
EATING THEM.

07:41.031 --> 07:42.993
IT'S GONNA TAKE YOU YEARS
TO GET THROUGH COLLEGE.

07:42.993 --> 07:46.767
IN A COUPLE HOURS,
I'M GONNA GO OUT TO THE BACKYARD
AND PASS ALL THESE COURSES.

07:48.599 --> 07:50.801
YOU'RE DOING CIRCUS TRICKS
AT MY PARTY?

07:50.801 --> 07:52.072
THAT WASN'T
THE POINT OF THE STORY.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.874
IT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.949
YOU KNOW, STAN WAS CHEWING
THOSE COLLEGE CATALOGS
LIKE HE WAS MAD AT THEM.

07:58.949 --> 08:00.511
AT LEAST
HE WAS STILL TALKING.

08:00.511 --> 08:02.913
YES, HE WAS, TY TY.
GOOD POINT.

08:04.154 --> 08:06.687
I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I FIRST
NOTICED HE WAS DEPRESSED.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.719
I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

08:08.719 --> 08:09.960
WHEN WAS IT?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.892
YESTERDAY.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.695
WHY'D YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME?
AM I IN TROUBLE?

08:14.695 --> 08:15.966
WHY WOULD YOU BE IN TROUBLE?

08:15.966 --> 08:17.968
IF YOU DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW. TYLER DID IT.

08:17.968 --> 08:20.971
NOTHING. I LOVE YOU.
FINE, STOP GRILLING ME!

08:20.971 --> 08:24.034
I HAVE SHRIMP IN MY POCKET!

08:25.135 --> 08:28.609
OKAY, WELL, WE'LL DEAL WITH
THE POCKET SHRIMP LATER.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.981
FIRST, CHLOE,

08:30.981 --> 08:36.146
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
YOUR VERY, VERY, VERY SPECIAL
SEVENTH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

08:36.146 --> 08:37.818
YES, WE'VE BEEN
DISCUSSING IT QUITE A BIT

08:37.818 --> 08:40.751
AND APPARENTLY SEVEN
IS A REALLY, REALLY BIG DEAL--

08:40.751 --> 08:44.995
MY PARENTS FORGOT
MY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY.
I WAS DEVASTATED.

08:44.995 --> 08:47.527
YES. THEY WENT FISHING,
THEY LEFT YOU AT GRANDMA'S,

08:47.527 --> 08:50.260
GRANDMA MADE YOU
PUT LOTION ON HER BACK.

08:50.260 --> 08:54.965
THEY BROUGHT ME BACK A TROUT.
I NAMED HIM LEO.

08:54.965 --> 08:57.167
THEY MADE ME EAT HIM.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.710
BENNETT, THE PARTY?

08:59.710 --> 09:01.011
IT WASN'T
REALLY A PARTY,

09:01.011 --> 09:05.115
MORE A SMALL GATHERING
TO CELEBRATE LEO'S LIFE.

09:05.115 --> 09:07.818
CHLOE'S PARTY!

09:07.818 --> 09:09.149
RIGHT, RIGHT.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.151
UM, CHLOE, WE WANT TO KNOW

09:11.151 --> 09:13.924
WHAT THE PARTY
OF YOUR DREAMS MIGHT BE.

09:13.924 --> 09:16.056
WELL, I HAVEN'T
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.058
BUT I'D LIKE A MERMAID PARTY
WITH SPACE CREATURES,

09:18.058 --> 09:22.562
A BOUNCY HOUSE, ZOO ANIMALS,
AND... NO BOYS.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.865
HONEY, THAT'S
AWFULLY EXTRAVAGANT.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.236
LEO WOULD HAVE LIKED IT.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.070
ARE YOU EVER GONNA
GET TO THE STAN PART?

09:30.070 --> 09:33.203
THE WHAT? OH, RIGHT.

09:33.203 --> 09:37.007
I COULD PROBABLY GET THEM
TO THROW IN A PETTING ZOO
FOR MY PARTY.

09:37.007 --> 09:39.009
YOU WANNA
CHASE AROUND SOME GOATS?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.082
MAYBE SOME GEESE?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.754
IF YOU BARK, THEY'LL HONK.

09:43.754 --> 09:46.086
BUT DON'T HONK--
THEY'LL KILL YOU.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.858
( laughs )

09:47.858 --> 09:51.121
I WAS JUST KIDDING, STAN.

09:51.121 --> 09:54.224
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:54.224 --> 09:56.126
WHY AREN'T YOU TALKING?

09:56.126 --> 09:59.800
STAN CAN'T TALK.
STAN CAN'T TALK!

09:59.800 --> 10:01.331
STAN CAN'T TALK!

10:01.331 --> 10:03.674
WHAT?
STAN CAN'T TALK!

10:03.674 --> 10:06.006
WELL, OF COURSE HE CAN'T,
SWEETHEART.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.178
I THOUGHT LEO COULD TALK.

10:08.178 --> 10:11.181
BUT WHEN HE TOLD ME TO LOOSEN
THE SCREWS ON GRANDMA'S WALKER,

10:11.181 --> 10:14.214
I KNEW IT WAS JUST IN MY HEAD.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.747
I KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH STAN!

10:16.747 --> 10:17.918
THINK ABOUT IT.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.389
WHAT'S ONE COMMON THREAD
RUNNING THROUGH

10:19.389 --> 10:21.922
ALL OF THE STORIES
WHEN WE WERE WITH STAN?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.224
ALL OF US MENTIONED
CHLOE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.798
HE STOPPED TALKING
THE THIRD TIME
HE HEARD ABOUT IT.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.629
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
FOR BEING BORN.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.734
I DON'T THINK.
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

10:33.734 --> 10:38.238
NO, NO, STAN IS UPSET
BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE BIRTHDAYS
AND HE DOESN'T.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.911
HE'S A RESCUE.
NO ONE KNOWS WHEN HE WAS BORN.

10:40.911 --> 10:44.745
THEREFORE, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO PULL HIM OUT OF HIS FUNK.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.817
( Russian accent )
BRING HIM SOUP!

10:49.019 --> 10:52.923
UH, NO. BUT I DO HAVE A PLAN.

10:52.923 --> 10:56.757
All: SURPRISE!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

10:56.757 --> 10:59.229
( all cheer )

11:10.040 --> 11:13.744
WAIT, STAN, COME BACK, OKAY?
TODAY'S YOUR NEW BIRTHDAY!

11:13.744 --> 11:15.746
YEAH, WE FOUND OUT
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DEPRESSED,

11:15.746 --> 11:17.848
SO WE'RE THROWING YOU A PARTY!

11:17.848 --> 11:20.050
All: WHOO!

11:20.050 --> 11:23.884
WE MADE LIVER CAKE
WITH BEEF INTESTINES.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.157
OH, THAT'S WHAT
THE CHEWY PART WAS.

11:27.157 --> 11:30.320
STAN, WE THREW YOU THIS PARTY.
HAVE SOME FUN!

11:30.320 --> 11:33.994
OOH! YOU KNOW WHAT'S
ALWAYS FUN? PLAYING FETCH.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.465
YOU GONNA GET IT?!
YOU GONNA GET IT?!

11:35.465 --> 11:37.097
GO GET IT!
GO!

11:37.097 --> 11:40.100
BALL!

11:40.100 --> 11:41.271
( horn honks )

11:41.271 --> 11:42.472
CHLOE, LOOK OUT!

11:42.472 --> 11:44.935
CHLOE, ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:44.935 --> 11:46.336
YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL!

11:46.336 --> 11:47.337
( all gasp )

11:47.337 --> 11:49.039
STAN, YOU TALKED!

11:49.039 --> 11:50.280
SO?

11:50.280 --> 11:52.042
SO WHY HAVEN'T
YOU BEEN TALKING?

11:52.042 --> 11:53.713
WHAT'S THE POINT?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.345
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

11:55.345 --> 11:58.919
LOOK, THE PARTY'S NICE AND ALL,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAS ME DOWN.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.923
I HEARD YOU GUYS TALKING.
YOU'RE ALL GONNA LEAVE ME.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.895
NO, WE'RE NOT.

12:04.895 --> 12:06.726
YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.858
TYLER, YOU'RE GONNA
GET A FOOD TRUCK

12:07.858 --> 12:09.800
AND DRIVE
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.262
AND CHLOE,
YOU'RE ANOTHER YEAR OLDER

12:12.262 --> 12:14.334
AND PRACTICALLY HAVE
ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.906
WHAT?!

12:15.906 --> 12:17.908
I MEANT
"ONE FOOT OUT THE DOOR."

12:17.908 --> 12:22.372
CUT ME SOME SLACK,
I'M BUMMED OUT
AND BAD WITH IDIOMS.

12:22.372 --> 12:28.078
LOOK, STAN, WE'RE NOT LEAVING
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.420
BUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.252
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

12:37.387 --> 12:39.860
( sighs ) WE'VE GOT
TO GET HIM SOME HELP.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.762
HIM? I GOT ONE FOOT
IN THE GRAVE!

12:46.096 --> 12:50.971
PATIENT W CONTINUES TO TAKE
HIS OBSESSION WITH STAR WARS
TO AN UNHEALTHY LEVEL.

12:50.971 --> 12:54.444
TODAY, ALL HE WOULD TALK ABOUT
WAS USING "THE FORCE."

12:54.444 --> 12:57.447
IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL
IF THAT WORKED.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.284
OH!

13:04.284 --> 13:05.856
DAD?

13:05.856 --> 13:08.118
YOU WILL KNOCK
BEFORE ENTERING THIS ROOM.

13:08.118 --> 13:12.322
YOUR JEDI MIND TRICKS
WILL NOT WORK ON ME!

13:12.322 --> 13:14.264
OH, WELL, HOW COOL ARE YOU?

13:14.264 --> 13:16.026
NOT VERY.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.128
UM, DAD,

13:18.128 --> 13:20.500
CAN I ASK YOU
A PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTION?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.572
YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING.
ARE YOU HAVING A PROBLEM?

13:22.572 --> 13:24.404
UH, NO, NOT REALLY.

13:24.404 --> 13:28.108
BUT I HAVE THIS FRIEND,
UM, AND HE'S KIND OF DEPRESSED.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.180
HE JUST REALIZED THAT LIFE
IS ALWAYS CHANGING.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.543
HE? HE? WHAT "HE" IS THIS?
IS THIS SOMEONE FROM SCHOOL?

13:33.543 --> 13:35.916
OH, IT'S JUST A FUNNY,
SARCASTIC GUY

13:35.916 --> 13:37.487
THAT I PLAY WITH
AT THE PARK SOMETIMES.

13:37.487 --> 13:39.589
WHAT?! HOW OLD IS THIS GUY?

13:39.589 --> 13:42.592
WELL, UH, NOBODY
REALLY KNOWS HIS REAL BIRTHDAY.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.554
HE MAYBE ONLY BE FOUR OR FIVE.

13:44.554 --> 13:46.897
AND HE'S HANGING OUT
IN THE PARK BY HIMSELF?

13:46.897 --> 13:48.398
WELL, NOT EXACTLY BY HIMSELF.

13:48.398 --> 13:51.001
I TAKE HIM THERE.
AND HE'S MORE LIKE 28.

13:51.001 --> 13:56.006
WHAT?! YOU HAVE
A MALE FRIEND WHO'S 28?!

13:56.006 --> 14:00.210
WAIT A SECOND.
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

14:00.210 --> 14:01.942
I DOUBT IT.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.075
THERE IS NO STRANGE FRIEND
FROM THE PARK, IS THERE?

14:05.075 --> 14:07.247
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.380
WOW, YOU ARE REALLY GOOD.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.924
WELL, I COULDN'T PUT IT ON
A BUS BENCH IF IT WASN'T TRUE.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.031
SO, TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

14:21.031 --> 14:23.033
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'VE EVER FELT LIKE THIS,

14:23.033 --> 14:26.366
BUT THE OTHER DAY I WOKE UP
AND IT JUST HIT ME:

14:26.366 --> 14:28.068
EVERYONE GROWS UP.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.369
OKAY.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.203
AND THEY MOVE AWAY. FOREVER.

14:33.203 --> 14:38.548
AND THAT MEANS THAT SOMEDAY,
SOMEDAY PRETTY SOON,

14:38.548 --> 14:41.912
OUR FAMILY
WON'T BE TOGETHER ANYMORE.

14:41.912 --> 14:45.655
( choked up )
AND I LOVE OUR FAMILY.
I DON'T WANT IT TO END.

14:45.655 --> 14:49.389
( choked up )
I DON'T WANT IT TO END EITHER.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.061
OH.
THANK YOU.

14:51.061 --> 14:53.063
( sniffles )

14:53.063 --> 14:55.195
IT JUST GOES SO FAST,
YOU KNOW?

14:55.195 --> 14:58.068
I MEAN, HOW DO WE
STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING?

14:58.068 --> 15:00.170
HOW DO WE DEAL
WITH OUR FEELINGS?

15:00.170 --> 15:03.003
DAD, YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO CHANGE YOUR BUS BENCH AD.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.338
OKAY, WHAT WE ARE FEELING--

15:08.338 --> 15:11.641
WHAT YOU ARE FEELING--
IS NATURAL.

15:11.641 --> 15:14.644
ESPECIALLY IF YOU
SPEND ALL YOUR TIME
DWELLING ON THE FUTURE.

15:14.644 --> 15:18.318
BUT I KNOW HOW
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.689
HOW?

15:19.689 --> 15:22.522
LIVE YOUR LIFE
IN THE PRESENT.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.195
SEE, THE PRESENT IS A GIFT.

15:25.195 --> 15:28.198
ENJOY WHAT YOU HAVE NOW
AND, WELL, BY THE TIME

15:28.198 --> 15:32.062
THE FUTURE COMES,
YOU'LL BE READY FOR IT.

15:32.062 --> 15:33.363
BUT WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT?

15:33.363 --> 15:37.367
( chuckles ) SOMEHOW,
HONEY, YOU ALWAYS ARE.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.209
THANKS, DAD.

15:41.111 --> 15:43.443
HEY, YOU WANNA HELP ME
OPEN THE DOOR?

15:43.443 --> 15:44.614
YES, I DO.

15:44.614 --> 15:46.176
( chuckles )

15:50.020 --> 15:51.481
I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT WANT A SNACK.

15:51.481 --> 15:54.654
I DID WANT A SNACK.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.390
HEY, I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME RESEARCH ON
YOUR HYPOCHONDRIA,

16:00.390 --> 16:02.392
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE
SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO SYMPTOMS,

16:02.392 --> 16:07.067
AND I CAME ACROSS
THIS RARE FORM
CALLED "NURTURE-OMANIA."

16:07.067 --> 16:10.400
OH, MY GOSH,
I MIGHT BE A NURTURE-OMANIAC.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.441
WHAT IS IT?

16:11.441 --> 16:14.104
WELL, UH, IT SAYS
IT'S WHERE A SPOUSE

16:14.104 --> 16:16.106
BECOMES OBSESSED
WITH TAKING CARE

16:16.106 --> 16:19.079
OF THEIR PARTNER'S
EVERY NEED.

16:19.079 --> 16:23.053
VERY FUNNY, BENNETT.
"NURTURE-OMANIA."

16:24.984 --> 16:26.616
OH, I REALLY WANT TO RUB
YOUR BACK RIGHT NOW

16:26.616 --> 16:29.519
AND MAKE YOU A FRITTATA,
BUT I AM NOT GOING TO.

16:29.519 --> 16:32.062
I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY PARTY.

16:32.062 --> 16:34.064
OH, GOOD,
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS BOOKED:

16:34.064 --> 16:35.695
THE MERMAID,
THE SPACE CREATURES,

16:35.695 --> 16:39.099
THE BOUNCY HOUSE,
THE ZOO ANIMALS, AND NO BOYS.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.670
I CHANGED MY MIND.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.132
WHAT?!

16:42.132 --> 16:44.134
DON'T CANCEL
THE BOUNCY HOUSE!

16:44.134 --> 16:47.006
WE PAID FOR AN EXTRA HOUR
FOR ADULT BOUNCY TIME.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.279
I WAS GONNA TRY A FLIP.

16:49.279 --> 16:51.141
I WANNA DO A FASHION PARTY.

16:51.141 --> 16:54.284
NO, NO, NO. IT'S TOO LATE.
WE ARE NOT CHANGING EVERYTHING.

16:54.284 --> 16:56.286
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST GIVE IT TO HER, HON.

16:56.286 --> 16:59.289
I MEAN, THE KIDS ARE HERE
FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME,

16:59.289 --> 17:01.791
THEN THEY GROW UP
AND MOVE AWAY.

17:01.791 --> 17:04.624
IT'S TRUE.
I'VE GOT ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE.

17:04.624 --> 17:08.258
( choked up ) SOON,
WE'RE NEVER GONNA
SEE 'EM AGAIN.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.531
WILL YOU HAND ME A TISSUE?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.564
NO, I WILL NOT. I WILL NOT
NURTURE YOU IN ANY WAY.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.567
( sighs )

17:17.567 --> 17:19.169
HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR FRITTATA?

17:22.372 --> 17:25.245
STAN? STAN?
I KNOW YOU'RE UNDER THERE.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.716
I CAN SEE YOUR TAIL.

17:29.079 --> 17:30.550
LOOK, I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS!

17:30.550 --> 17:33.123
I'VE FIGURED OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU!

17:33.123 --> 17:35.755
I KNOW WHAT'LL GET YOU OUT
FROM UNDER THE BED.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.389
I KNOW YOU WANT TO LICK 'EM!

17:39.389 --> 17:43.393
I WORE THICK WOOL SOCKS
AND SHOES THAT DON'T BREATHE.

17:43.393 --> 17:47.167
THIS LITTLE PIGGY
IS VERY SALTY.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.338
( sighs )

17:48.338 --> 17:49.669
STAN, I TALKED TO DAD

17:49.669 --> 17:51.671
AND I KNOW HOW TO
SNAP YOU OUT OF THIS.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.344
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT;
WE'RE ALL GONNA GROW UP.

17:54.344 --> 17:56.346
BUT THE PRESENT IS A GIFT.

17:56.346 --> 17:59.849
AND IF WE SPEND ALL OF OUR TIME
WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE,

17:59.849 --> 18:02.852
WE'LL MISS EVERYTHING GREAT
ABOUT LIFE RIGHT NOW:

18:02.852 --> 18:05.185
LIKE TAKING WALKS TOGETHER,

18:05.185 --> 18:08.758
AND THROWING BALLS AROUND
IN THE PARK,

18:08.758 --> 18:11.291
AND LICKING BETWEEN MY TOES.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.762
I DON'T WANT TO GET
ATTACHED TO YOUR TOES

18:12.762 --> 18:16.166
WHEN THEY'RE JUST GONNA GO OFF
TO COLLEGE SOMEDAY WITHOUT ME.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.297
BUT THEY HAVEN'T YET.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.800
AND I HEAR BETWEEN THE BIG TOE
AND THE SECOND TOE,

18:20.800 --> 18:24.174
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT
TAKING A GAP YEAR.

18:24.174 --> 18:26.536
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT JOKE
IS GONNA GET ME OUT OF HERE?

18:27.777 --> 18:31.341
OOH! I CAN PUT SOME
PEANUT BUTTER ON THEM.

18:38.288 --> 18:42.322
COME ON,
IF MY PEANUT BUTTER TOES
AND WHAT DAD SAID

18:42.322 --> 18:46.296
CAN'T SNAP YOU OUT OF THIS,
WELL, THEN THAT'S IT.

18:46.296 --> 18:50.200
I'M REALLY WORRIED, STAN.
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE IDEAS.

18:51.201 --> 18:54.204
OOH, PEANUT BUTTER!
MY FAVORITE!

18:54.204 --> 18:55.805
MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE THAT.

18:55.805 --> 18:57.267
TYLER, YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.208
WHO'S GONNA STOP ME?

18:58.208 --> 19:00.340
I GUESS NO ONE.

19:06.176 --> 19:08.478
UNBELIEVABLE--
AFTER MERMAIDS
AND SPACE CREATURES

19:08.478 --> 19:10.220
AND PRINCESSES,
THIS IS WHAT SHE PICKED.

19:10.220 --> 19:13.723
YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
A CHLOE-THEMED PARTY
IS VERY ORIGINAL.

19:13.723 --> 19:17.187
All: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

19:17.187 --> 19:20.430
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
THIS IS FREAKY!

19:20.430 --> 19:24.294
WHAT'S FREAKY?

19:24.294 --> 19:26.366
FIRST, I WILL AMAZE YOU...

19:26.366 --> 19:27.437
( all gasp )

19:27.437 --> 19:29.939
WITH CONTORTIONS
TAUGHT TO ME BY...

19:29.939 --> 19:34.674
A SERIES OF
FIVE-MINUTE ONLINE VIDEOS.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.206
DON'T GET BENT OUT OF SHAPE.

19:36.206 --> 19:40.480
( laughs )
CLASSIC CONTORTIONIST JOKE.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.913
HEY, MY FEET STILL
SMELL LIKE PEANUT BUTTER.

19:43.913 --> 19:47.417
SWEETIE, I THINK
YOU'RE SCARING THE GUESTS.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.889
OH, THEN THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT
WHEN MY TIBIA SNAPS.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.562
I'M STUCK. CAN YOU HELP ME
OUT OF THIS?

19:52.562 --> 19:53.563
OH, YEAH.

19:57.327 --> 19:58.628
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

20:01.701 --> 20:03.703
HEY, YOU MISSED MY BIG FINISH.

20:03.703 --> 20:08.207
IT TOOK DAD AND THREE CHLOES
TO GET ME UNFOLDED.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.339
WHY AREN'T YOU AT YOUR PARTY?

20:09.339 --> 20:11.841
ALL THOSE CHLOES
ARE FREAKING ME OUT.

20:11.841 --> 20:13.983
BUT I THOUGHT A CHLOE PARTY
WAS WHAT YOU WANTED.

20:13.983 --> 20:15.645
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA IN MY HEAD,

20:15.645 --> 20:19.249
BUT NOW IT FEELS LIKE EVERYONE
IS MAKING FUN OF ME.

20:19.249 --> 20:22.522
OH, GOOD,
THEY GOT YOU UNFOLDED.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.724
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA HAVE
TO BECOME A SERVICE DOG.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.528
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
THE BIRTHDAY GIRL?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.330
SHE DOESN'T LIKE HER PARTY.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.863
WHAT? YOU DON'T WANNA MISS
YOUR SEVENTH BIRTHDAY.

20:33.863 --> 20:35.535
YOU ONLY TURN SEVEN ONCE.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.467
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRY TO ENJOY IT,

20:37.467 --> 20:39.609
BECAUSE ONCE IT'S GONE, IT'S...

20:39.609 --> 20:41.671
ONCE IT'S GONE, WHAT?

20:41.671 --> 20:44.514
ONCE IT'S GONE,
YOU NEVER GET IT BACK AGAIN.

20:44.514 --> 20:47.977
YOU NEVER GET
THIS DAY BACK AGAIN.

20:47.977 --> 20:50.249
I DON'T WANT
THIS DAY BACK AGAIN.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.481
QUIET.
WE'RE ONTO SOMETHING ELSE.

20:53.283 --> 20:56.286
IF I SPEND ALL MY TIME
WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE,

20:56.286 --> 20:58.558
I'LL MISS EVERYTHING GREAT
ABOUT LIFE RIGHT NOW.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.490
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID TO YOU.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.962
NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
I CAME UP WITH THAT ON MY OWN.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.495
THE THING IS,
BEFORE I CAME TO THIS FAMILY,

21:05.495 --> 21:10.500
I NEVER GOT SAD LIKE THIS
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD
SO MUCH TO LOSE.

21:10.500 --> 21:15.274
WELL, THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY
FOR HAVING PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
THAT YOU LOVE SO MUCH.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.577
THEN IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.781
OH, MY ONE REGRET IS THAT
I DIDN'T LICK YOUR TOES

21:21.781 --> 21:24.514
AFTER YOU SMEARED THAT
PEANUT BUTTER TOAST ON THEM.

21:24.514 --> 21:28.588
THAT'S NOT
THE PEANUT BUTTER TOAST
I ATE, IS IT?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.490
YOU SAID I COULDN'T STOP YOU.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.991
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S MORE DISTURBING--

21:31.991 --> 21:34.764
THE FACT THAT I ATE IT,
OR THE FACT THAT I LIKED IT!

21:36.466 --> 21:38.368
HEY, WHAT ABOUT
MY STINKY BIRTHDAY?

21:38.368 --> 21:39.829
I HAVE AN IDEA.

21:39.829 --> 21:42.502
OKAY! HE'S A GOOD BOY!

21:42.502 --> 21:46.436
SO, I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING
AND ENJOY THE PRESENT.

21:46.436 --> 21:48.408
I EVEN INVENTED A LITTLE SAYING
TO REMEMBER THAT:

21:48.408 --> 21:51.080
THE PRESENT IS A GIFT.

21:51.080 --> 21:54.784
I'M PRETTY SURE
I CAME UP WITH THAT.

21:54.784 --> 21:56.446
ANYWAY,
I DECIDED IT WAS TIME

21:56.446 --> 21:58.618
TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY PARTY
FOR MYSELF.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.650
I JUST WISH I'D COME UP
WITH A DIFFERENT THEME.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.493
CHLOE WAS RIGHT.

22:03.493 --> 22:06.596
IT TOTALLY FREAKED ME OUT.

22:08.858 --> 22:10.930
THAT WAS QUITE A PARTY.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.933
I'M GONNA TAKE CHLOE UPSTAIRS
AND PUT HER TO BED.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.935
I JUST TUCKED CHLOE IN
ON THE COUCH.

22:17.407 --> 22:20.570
CHLOE CONKED OUT AT THE PARK.
I'M TAKING HER UP TO BED.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.572
Both: CHLOE!
