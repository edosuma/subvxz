<b>1x12 - Invasion</b>

00:22.585 --> 00:24.919
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

00:24.987 --> 00:26.921
<i>The Lighthouse was created
as a way to travel</i>

00:26.989 --> 00:29.591
<i>through the asteroid barrier
separating the forgotten zone</i>

00:29.658 --> 00:31.326
<i>from Guardian space.</i>

00:31.394 --> 00:33.862
<i>Your job is to get
to the Lighthouse first</i>

00:33.929 --> 00:37.298
<i>and destroy it by
any means necessary.</i>

00:38.184 --> 00:40.701
<i><font color="lime"> sync & correction by f1nc0

00:58.087 --> 01:01.089
I grow tired of your
antics, Thanagarian.

01:01.157 --> 01:05.260
Tell me the code to
the Lighthouse... now.

01:05.327 --> 01:08.696
For 2,000.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.833
Money? You dare haggle
with lord Atrocitus

01:11.901 --> 01:14.302
as if you were
a stinkin' lop fruit vendor?

01:14.370 --> 01:18.239
Aah!

01:18.307 --> 01:21.443
1,000?

01:22.545 --> 01:27.348
He did come down 50%, master.
That's a pretty good deal.

01:29.552 --> 01:32.353
Do you know what I can do to you?

01:32.421 --> 01:38.359
I'll make you scream for years.
You'll be me for death.

01:38.427 --> 01:41.629
But you still won't have
the code to the Lighthouse.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.068
<i>Aah!</i>

01:51.373 --> 01:54.909
That you could agree with this
course of action astounds me.

01:54.977 --> 01:56.911
It's a fool's errand.

01:56.979 --> 01:59.180
Saving lives is never a fool's errand.

01:59.248 --> 02:01.483
We can get to the Lighthouse
before Atrocitus does.

02:01.550 --> 02:04.819
But the ship's ultrawarp
drives are almost fixed.

02:04.887 --> 02:07.989
In fact, they are 99.62% complete

02:08.056 --> 02:10.558
and will be fully operational
within hours.

02:10.626 --> 02:12.193
We should return to Oa.

02:12.261 --> 02:14.929
Then we can engage Atrocitus'
fleet with reinforcements.

02:14.997 --> 02:18.333
By that time, his armada's in
Oan space destroying worlds.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.336
If we blow the Lighthouse, we
may not even need to fight a war.

02:21.403 --> 02:24.772
If we seal off that gateway,
we keep the two sides apart,

02:24.840 --> 02:27.942
they can't get at each other
and no one gets killed, see?

02:28.010 --> 02:31.279
Oh, yes, what could possibly go wrong?

02:35.518 --> 02:39.754
Fix the blasted thing. You're
supposed to be a technological genius.

02:39.822 --> 02:42.624
How can a simple interstellar
receiver bedevil you?

02:42.691 --> 02:45.160
Because I fixed it 50 times now.

02:45.227 --> 02:48.429
If someone wouldn't stomp the
receiver every time they got mad,

02:48.497 --> 02:50.265
it wouldn't break.

02:50.332 --> 02:53.568
We have been stuck on this
accursed living rock for years.

02:53.636 --> 02:56.070
Excuse me if a message
from the Red Lanterns

02:56.138 --> 02:57.705
raises my warrior spirit.

02:57.773 --> 03:00.608
They said they were coming,
but we don't know why.

03:00.676 --> 03:05.180
Isn't it obvious? Atrocitus
needs a leader for his armies.

03:05.247 --> 03:07.916
He knows it's my destiny
to be at the center

03:07.983 --> 03:10.685
of the greatest battle in all of time.

03:12.688 --> 03:16.524
Mogo, after my planet was
devastated by the Red Lanterns,

03:16.592 --> 03:20.662
you pulled me from my blackest night.
You called me here to you.

03:20.729 --> 03:22.363
<i>I did?</i>

03:22.431 --> 03:25.033
In my dream.
You said if I came here,

03:25.100 --> 03:26.935
I'd find a beacon of hope
for the galaxy,

03:27.002 --> 03:28.603
someone who would stop
the Red Lanterns

03:28.671 --> 03:31.806
from doing what they did to
my people and so many others.

03:31.874 --> 03:33.508
<i>I did?</i>

03:33.576 --> 03:36.644
Are you sure the galaxy's
savior isn't you, wise one?

03:36.712 --> 03:38.947
I would willingly serve you.

03:39.014 --> 03:41.382
<i>I am not.</i>

03:41.450 --> 03:44.819
You are a planet of few words, and I
quite like how mysterious you can be.

03:44.887 --> 03:46.955
But now I ask a direct question.

03:47.022 --> 03:51.960
Who is the savior and
where do I find him or her?

03:54.463 --> 03:57.165
<i>Climb.</i>

04:14.116 --> 04:17.584
We have arrived at the coordinates
to activate the Lighthouse.

04:17.653 --> 04:19.853
I hope that code
Byth Rok gave us works,

04:19.922 --> 04:22.223
otherwise it's gonna be
a bumpy ride.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.292
Having to count on
the word of a scoundrel

04:24.360 --> 04:27.328
is one of many reasons
to not be here.

04:27.396 --> 04:30.832
Birdman couldn't lie. The code
was picked right out of his head.

04:30.899 --> 04:33.201
If anyone could lie
to themselves, it's be Byth.

04:33.269 --> 04:36.137
No use talking about it, though.
Input the code.

04:36.205 --> 04:39.795
Code phrase red dwarf
born of Galman Nebula uploaded

04:39.830 --> 04:43.911
and ready to be broadcast in
its galactic 6 numerical equivalent.

05:06.235 --> 05:09.237
- Whoa.
- Agreed.

05:09.305 --> 05:12.640
Everybody hold your breath.

05:27.089 --> 05:28.656
Oh!

05:28.724 --> 05:32.293
What's wrong, Bolovaxian,
claustrophobic?

05:32.361 --> 05:36.531
No. I just don't like
small, close spaces, ok?

05:36.598 --> 05:40.601
We are approaching
a free-floating structure ahead.

05:42.104 --> 05:46.974
The Lighthouse. One of the
wonders of the ancient galaxy.

05:49.311 --> 05:53.214
It's a shame to destroy this, but no
building is worth the cost of a war.

05:53.282 --> 05:55.383
Hold up.
If we blow this thing,

05:55.451 --> 05:57.385
won't the tunnel just
collapse around us?

05:57.453 --> 05:59.921
Not if I set it up to explode remotely.

05:59.988 --> 06:04.625
Guess it's lucky for us you were
head of your class in sabotage school.

06:04.693 --> 06:06.194
Aya, prepare to dock.

06:06.261 --> 06:10.765
Let's get this done quick and
clean, then hightail it to Oa.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.967
[Lighthouse whirs]

06:17.573 --> 06:20.408
Taking heavy fire, all sides.

06:24.713 --> 06:27.382
I can't move. We're stuck.

06:36.468 --> 06:39.904
I reserve the right to say "
I told you so" if we get out of here. 

06:39.972 --> 06:42.240
Kilowog, Razer, let's go.

06:50.115 --> 06:52.617
Red Lanterns.
How'd they get the code?

06:52.684 --> 06:54.886
My guess would be Byth Rok.

07:20.846 --> 07:22.346
<i>Shields degrading to critical.</i>

07:22.414 --> 07:25.216
We better fall back before
there's anymore surprises.

07:38.497 --> 07:42.500
Aya, ship's status.
Are the ultrawarp coils ok?

07:42.568 --> 07:47.271
They received no damage and will
be fully operational in 122 minutes.

07:47.339 --> 07:51.475
Can't let that happen again.
Time to re-strategize.

08:04.623 --> 08:07.225
Red Lanterns? Here?

08:15.300 --> 08:19.237
<i>Atrocitus!
Free me!</i>

08:19.304 --> 08:23.874
I will lead your armies and
unleash all the destruction you ask.

08:23.942 --> 08:29.013
It is my destiny to win
the greatest battle ever fought.

08:30.549 --> 08:35.753
<i>Your path does not include
vengeance, Saint Walker. Climb.</i>

08:35.821 --> 08:37.355
No, wise one.

08:37.422 --> 08:40.157
These beings destroyed
my world and many others.

08:40.225 --> 08:41.592
They cannot be ignored.

08:41.659 --> 08:45.185
<i>They are not your concern.</i>

08:50.002 --> 08:52.803
<i>Climb.</i>

09:10.856 --> 09:13.357
That Lighthouse has got to go.

09:13.425 --> 09:16.360
It's too heavily protected. We
can't get through those defenses.

09:16.428 --> 09:17.628
Green Lantern, how?

09:17.696 --> 09:21.365
Sensors indicated the Red Lantern
armada is en route to our coordinates.

09:21.433 --> 09:25.236
Estimating time of arrival
in 47 minutes, 20 seconds.

09:25.304 --> 09:28.939
The armada will make it
through before we can stop them.

09:30.809 --> 09:32.543
The beam that creates
the force tunnel.

09:32.611 --> 09:35.579
- What if we flew into it?
- Well, how's that?

09:35.647 --> 09:37.782
What if we flew inside the beam

09:37.849 --> 09:39.784
and followed it all the way
to the Lighthouse?

09:39.851 --> 09:43.020
By my readings, the intensity
of the energy making up the beam

09:43.088 --> 09:45.122
would make us virtually invisible.

09:45.190 --> 09:48.426
Are you suggested we fly
into the emitter?

09:48.493 --> 09:51.195
Jordan, the ship's
way too big for that.

09:51.263 --> 09:53.397
And look how that thing's
rotating.

09:53.465 --> 09:56.100
Nobody can do that type
of precision flying.

09:56.168 --> 10:00.604
- I can.
- Too dangerous. I'll do it.

10:00.672 --> 10:03.174
Green Lantern, how?
Respectfully, you would fail.

10:03.241 --> 10:07.178
The same attributes at make you an
extraordinary pilot in fluid situations

10:07.245 --> 10:08.979
make you unsuited for this task,

10:09.047 --> 10:11.982
which requires flying
a pattern of absolute conformity.

10:12.050 --> 10:14.085
I am a logical choice for this mission.

10:14.152 --> 10:18.055
And as you would say,
I am no longer a rookie.

10:25.030 --> 10:28.132
Don't be a hero.
First sign of trouble, come back.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.533
That's an order.

10:29.601 --> 10:33.604
I will keep you apprised of my progress.

10:51.623 --> 10:54.058
Never seen a machine fly that good.

10:54.126 --> 10:57.828
Perhaps that's more to her
than meets the eye.

10:57.896 --> 11:02.733
Gravimetric forces increasing
exponentially. This is difficult.

11:02.801 --> 11:07.471
- Aya, turn around.
- Negative. I will not fail.

11:09.808 --> 11:14.912
Aya, come in. Aya!
Respond!

11:14.980 --> 11:16.647
She totally disobeyed my order.

11:16.715 --> 11:22.119
Oh, yeah. You especially should
get mad when someone breaks the rules.

11:36.368 --> 11:40.137
<i>Glorious invasion and we're
stuck playing watchdogs.</i>

11:40.205 --> 11:43.607
<i>Don't discount the importance
of this mission, please.</i>

11:43.675 --> 11:46.010
<i>We successfully
occupied a location...</i>

11:46.077 --> 11:47.344
[continues indistinctly]

11:47.412 --> 11:51.115
<i>Our names will be screamed
for ages to come.</i>

11:57.856 --> 11:59.123
[growls]

11:59.191 --> 12:01.926
Security breach.
Destroy her!

12:05.030 --> 12:07.431
The automatic defenses
have been dealt with,

12:07.499 --> 12:09.300
but the Red Lanterns
still pose a problem.

12:09.367 --> 12:11.068
They seem quite angry.

12:11.136 --> 12:13.804
We're coming.
Hold on!

12:39.364 --> 12:41.098
Your handiwork, Aya?

12:41.166 --> 12:44.735
Yes. I simply reversed the
turret's targeting parameters

12:44.803 --> 12:47.538
so the Red Lanterns were
the enemy instead of us.

12:47.606 --> 12:52.510
You're right.
You're not a rookie anymore.

12:58.383 --> 13:01.185
<i>Lord Atrocitus, we were forced
from the Lighthouse</i>

13:01.253 --> 13:04.455
<i>by several Green Lanterns
and the traitor Razer.</i>

13:04.523 --> 13:05.856
<i>What are your orders?</i>

13:05.924 --> 13:10.227
Report to your squadrons to prepare
for our invasion of Guardian space.

13:11.096 --> 13:16.667
What? I mean to say, my lord,
that your lack of temperate,

13:16.735 --> 13:21.472
it leaves us totally incompetent,
was delightfully unexpected, but why?

13:21.540 --> 13:25.075
Do not ever question me, Zenias.

13:36.021 --> 13:38.289
The technology's strange to me,

13:38.356 --> 13:40.724
but I believe this will
cause the energy that

13:40.725 --> 13:43.093
powers the Lighthouse to
feed back into its reactor.

13:43.161 --> 13:45.796
Do you think it'll be enough
to close this tunnel for good?

13:45.864 --> 13:50.434
I can't answer with certainty,
but we'll be the first to know.

13:56.942 --> 14:01.679
Master, they're leaving. It looks
like they've set the place to detonate.

14:01.746 --> 14:04.081
Should I send in some
technicians to diffuse it?

14:04.149 --> 14:07.318
No. Its destruction
will serve my purpose.

14:07.385 --> 14:10.588
Deploy the Liberators.

14:25.003 --> 14:28.305
They're already here.
Razer, hit it.

14:46.424 --> 14:49.760
Did I mention how much
I hate closed spaces?

15:09.634 --> 15:11.668
Why, that rotten... 

15:19.277 --> 15:20.978
[growls]

15:28.419 --> 15:31.622
Powering the Interceptor's
falinks energy gun system.

15:31.689 --> 15:33.824
[whirring]

15:39.230 --> 15:41.265
[growling]

15:41.332 --> 15:44.167
Hold on.
Gonna be close.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.970
Must go faster.

15:47.038 --> 15:49.239
Hit it. Hit it.
Hit it. Hit it.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.688
We did it!
We're home free.

16:04.756 --> 16:08.425
No way those Reds are getting
into Oan space anytime soon.

16:08.493 --> 16:10.928
Aya, how's the ship holding up?

16:10.995 --> 16:13.263
Despite sustaining
considerable damage,

16:13.331 --> 16:16.099
repairs on the ultrawarp coils
are now complete.

16:16.167 --> 16:18.001
Really? You're sure?

16:18.069 --> 16:22.673
Wait, I have to hear the words.
You mean we can go home?

16:22.740 --> 16:24.594
The Interceptor is fully functional.

16:24.595 --> 16:27.377
We may set course for any
destination you choose.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.480
Ha ha ha!
Come here!

16:30.548 --> 16:33.150
Thank you for this
demonstration, sergeant Kilowog.

16:33.217 --> 16:35.786
I hate to be the glurg
in the punchbowl,

16:35.853 --> 16:39.056
but it seems we weren't the
only ones to make it through.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.569
[grunts]

16:55.540 --> 16:58.075
[panting]

16:58.142 --> 17:03.413
I am... here, brother.

17:04.582 --> 17:06.383
I've done what you asked.

17:06.451 --> 17:10.753
Now show me the savior.
Show me hope.

17:20.098 --> 17:24.267
Atrocitus couldn't have just been
crushed in that tunnel, could he?

17:24.335 --> 17:27.270
Aya, scan the ship.
Make sure the damage is real.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.040
The Red Lantern ship
has a ruptured coolant system.

17:30.108 --> 17:34.111
Power reactor is offline.
Hydraulic pressure zero.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.179
Life support failing.

17:36.247 --> 17:39.082
Kilowog, with me. We'll
pick up ugly one and ugly two

17:39.150 --> 17:41.218
for a well-deserved trip
to a science cell.

17:41.285 --> 17:44.454
I'm coming with you.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.890
Aya, you're in charge
of the ship while we're away.

17:46.958 --> 17:49.059
Any sign of trouble and you head to Oa.

17:49.127 --> 17:50.460
Affirmative.

17:51.963 --> 17:55.465
This time I'm bringing
a little insurance.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.707
It's over, Atrocitus.

18:07.478 --> 18:09.713
Where are they hiding?

18:13.551 --> 18:16.086
<i>2, 1.</i>

18:16.154 --> 18:17.621
Get out!

18:24.295 --> 18:26.997
Why would you do this
to me, brother?

18:27.065 --> 18:29.433
Do you want to teach me
there is no hope,

18:29.500 --> 18:32.636
There is no savior?

18:32.703 --> 18:37.607
Well, I cannot give up.
My spirit will not be broken.

18:37.675 --> 18:39.176
I believe.

18:39.243 --> 18:43.313
I will fight the Red Lanterns
no matter how many may come.

18:43.381 --> 18:46.783
All will be well.

19:18.850 --> 19:20.484
What happened?

19:20.551 --> 19:22.819
We got caught with
our pants down, that's what.

19:22.887 --> 19:27.624
Atrocitus set the ship to self
destruct. I can't believe I fell for it.

19:27.692 --> 19:30.827
Aya. Do you read me, Aya?

19:42.707 --> 19:47.644
I'm sorry, Hal. I'm now a soldier for
the righteous crusade of Atrocitus.

19:47.712 --> 19:51.681
I'm pleased you could
join our cause, Drusa.

19:51.749 --> 19:56.853
[laughs] Zartok was so
very surprised it wasn't him.

19:56.921 --> 19:58.121
[chuckles]

19:58.189 --> 20:01.424
This is so good
it's hard to stay angry.

20:05.596 --> 20:08.398
Set course for Oa.

20:18.309 --> 20:21.011
Aya, no!

20:34.091 --> 20:36.560
What about Razer
and his Green Lantern cronies?

20:36.627 --> 20:40.630
Let the armada deal with them.

20:44.435 --> 20:46.570
[explosion]

21:04.655 --> 21:09.759
He did it.
Atrocitus used those planet killers

21:09.827 --> 21:11.895
to tear a hole right
through the Maelstrom.

21:11.963 --> 21:16.499
Big enough for his whole
armada to roll into Oan space.

21:16.567 --> 21:21.171
What are we gonna do?
Jordan, what are we gonna do?

21:21.239 --> 21:25.009
I don't know.
I just don't know.

21:28.082 --> 21:30.962
