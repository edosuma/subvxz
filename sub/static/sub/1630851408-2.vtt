WEBVTT

00:46.964 --> 00:48.715
Almost there.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.302
Keep them closed. Now!

00:56.473 --> 00:57.683
Wow!

00:59.601 --> 01:01.395
Let's give you the grand tour.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.399
This is Blip's bunk,

01:05.482 --> 01:07.609
and this is Oneira's bunk,

01:07.693 --> 01:10.112
and this is my bunk.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.781
And this is my desk,

01:12.865 --> 01:16.076
and these are my pet twigs,and this is Norman.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.453
-Say hello, Norman.-Hello.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.539
Isn't he clever?

01:20.622 --> 01:23.375
-Oh, but we mustn't dally.-Bye, Norman!

01:24.459 --> 01:25.669
Hello.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.298
-This must be Xandra's bunk.-Hey!

01:29.381 --> 01:31.717
Hands off my stuff, human.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.886
Oneira, once again...

01:33.969 --> 01:36.388
Oh, crumbs! That's Blip and Oneira.

01:36.471 --> 01:40.976
They can't know you're a human,so just try to be less human-y.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.769
Yes, and more spryte-y.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.649
No! Less human-y.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.737
Perfect! Don't move.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.040
Hello, fellow spritz.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.249
-Sprytes.-Sprytes.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.876
This is Wolfboy.

02:05.959 --> 02:11.006
He's new, and he's definitely not a human.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.634
Wait, what?

02:14.551 --> 02:16.470
I never get his jokes either.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.388
Just give us a few minutes.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.518
I thought that went very well.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.603
Sprout, that was terrible.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.524
Don't you understand what will happenif anyone finds out he's a human?

02:28.607 --> 02:31.109
Professor Luxcraft will send him home.

02:31.193 --> 02:34.613
But more importantly,we would get in trouble.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.782
But I can't go back now.

02:36.865 --> 02:41.828
I like being here with you and Floofand Norman.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.038
Hello.

02:43.121 --> 02:47.960
Please, teach me how I can fit inand be a spryte so I can stay.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.591
Listen up, human,'cause we're only gonna go over this once.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.719
This is the Factory.It's at the center of the Earth.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.473
-It's where we live and work and---Create things for my world.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.017
It's not your world, human.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.062
Sprytes were creating thingsway before you came along,

03:07.145 --> 03:09.147
acting like you own the place.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.317
But yes, this is wherewe create things for the world.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.988
This is perfect. I love creating things.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.115
I make things all the time.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.284
-Like what?-Like this.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.371
Yes, I love it.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.373
What is it?

03:26.456 --> 03:31.420
I call it the Cap of Clairvoyance.It lets you sense other people's thoughts.

03:32.254 --> 03:36.717
I'm sensing Xandra's very cross.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.761
Hey! It works.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.306
It doesn't work.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.473
What's that noise?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.350
Oh, no. I forgot about this.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.395
Star Trial! Star Trial! Star Trial!

03:48.478 --> 03:51.899
We heard there's a new sprytein this dorm.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.944
Oh, yeah. That's me.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.328
You're a funny-looking spryte.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.288
What do you want, Tali?

04:06.371 --> 04:09.249
It's time for his Star Trial.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.626
What's that?

04:10.709 --> 04:13.837
The Star Trial is an age-old tradition.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.923
Every new spryte attempts iton their first night.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.635
All you have to do is sneak outside,

04:19.718 --> 04:22.971
make it past the guard,cross the lake, climb the tower,

04:23.055 --> 04:26.308
creep into the Star Creature's nestwithout waking it up,

04:26.391 --> 04:28.769
grab a star and bring it back here.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.314
-Did you say Star Creature?-That's right.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.650
Any spryte who returns with a star

04:34.733 --> 04:37.694
can display it proudlyon the ceiling of their dorm.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.864
But I don't see any stars up there.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.950
Neither do I.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.037
Only the best sprytes bring back a star.

04:47.663 --> 04:51.625
Wolfboy, you'll never be able to do thiswithout spryte powers.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.170
And besides,you're supposed to be laying low.

04:55.254 --> 04:59.591
But I'm also supposed to befitting in, right?

04:59.675 --> 05:02.678
If this is what all sprytes doon their first night,

05:02.761 --> 05:04.513
then shouldn't I do it too?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.307
-I'll do it!-Yeah! Let's go!

05:07.391 --> 05:10.435
And I'll get us one of those starswhile I'm at it.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.910
Creep out of the dorm, check.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.734
Past the guards and over the bridge.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.913
He'll never get across the lake.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.707
-He will.-Yeah? How?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.375
What powers does he have?

06:15.459 --> 06:16.668
He has a hat!

06:17.669 --> 06:18.837
A hat.

06:18.921 --> 06:22.758
Xandra, maybe you should have had a hatwhen you did this trial.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.760
Can't he just float across?

06:24.843 --> 06:27.304
Not everyone can float, Oneira!

07:16.854 --> 07:20.023
-Yay! Yay, Wolfboy!-Yeah! Go, Wolfy!

07:25.946 --> 07:28.699
How are we gonna get up there?

07:29.992 --> 07:32.953
Maybe I could make a jetpack.

08:03.108 --> 08:06.195
Who has entered my chamber?

08:06.278 --> 08:08.614
Show yourself.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.242
It is...

08:12.326 --> 08:16.246
I, the Great Wolf.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.041
The Great Wolf?

08:19.124 --> 08:24.087
And what brings you into my chamberuninvited?

08:24.922 --> 08:29.218
I want a star, please.

08:32.346 --> 08:36.058
The Great Wolf, I presume?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.893
Hello.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.609
You've come for one of my scales,haven't you?

08:46.276 --> 08:48.445
Just like the others.

08:54.535 --> 08:58.038
But you're not like the others, are you?

08:58.121 --> 08:59.164
Yes, I am.

08:59.248 --> 09:03.919
You pretend to be something you are not.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.550
Surface dweller!

09:10.050 --> 09:13.554
Humans have already drowned outthe light of the stars.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.931
Now you want to steal mine?

09:16.723 --> 09:19.184
You're all the same.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.355
Hey, wait!

09:33.532 --> 09:34.700
Oh, no!

09:39.913 --> 09:42.165
Feisty one, eh?

09:46.378 --> 09:49.131
Please. I need a star.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.509
Now, why do you need it?

09:52.593 --> 09:55.512
So I don't have to go back home.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.404
Okay, Great Wolf.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.615
-I'll see you around.-What?

10:14.698 --> 10:16.408
No!

10:35.219 --> 10:36.929
He did it!

10:37.012 --> 10:40.474
Sprout? Sprout! Are you okay?

10:40.557 --> 10:43.727
Did you see that, Xandra? He flew!

10:43.810 --> 10:45.854
I think you might have bumped your head.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.524
That proves he is a spryte,

10:48.607 --> 10:52.194
because I'm almost certainthat humans can't fly.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.238
Isn't he the best?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.497
-Yeah!-Yeah!

11:04.081 --> 11:06.083
-Good job!-Yeah!

11:07.960 --> 11:09.253
You did it!

11:10.629 --> 11:12.297
Yeah!

11:15.551 --> 11:16.760
Yeah!

11:23.058 --> 11:26.061
Wolfy, it's time to finish the tour.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.316
This one's your bunk.

11:34.111 --> 11:37.865
You'll need to decorate.Here's something to get you started.

11:39.283 --> 11:42.119
You made this... for me?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.538
Of course. What are friends for?

11:45.455 --> 11:46.957
I don't know.

11:47.749 --> 11:51.128
I guessI've never really had friends before.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.732
Dear Mum,

12:12.482 --> 12:17.237
You were right.This time really is different.

12:18.030 --> 12:21.116
I think this is the placewhere I'm supposed to be.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.542
Could it really be him?

12:40.511 --> 12:43.055
-He did!-He didn't.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.723
-Did.-Didn't!

12:44.806 --> 12:46.642
Did, did, did, did, did!

12:46.725 --> 12:51.063
Sprout, he didn't fly. You must'vehad moss in your eye or something.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.690
Moss? Wolfy, tell her.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.944
Sorry, Sprout.I honestly don't know what happened.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.403
It's kind of a blur.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.324
Hey, what's with all these doors?

13:03.534 --> 13:07.371
They all lead to labs,and every lab is different.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.123
Oh, the labs are where you make things.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.501
Well, grown-up sprytes do.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.003
We're still learning, but we get to help.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.674
Today we're assistingProfessor Lapin Rabscuttle.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.385
Cool. What are we making?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.845
-Sharks?-Better.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.805
-Lava?-Better.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.807
Sharks that swim through lava?

13:26.890 --> 13:28.016
Better!

13:28.100 --> 13:29.184
Rabbits!

13:32.479 --> 13:36.275
Noble creatures. Resilient, steadfast.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.865
Excuse me.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.033
Professor Rab-bits...

13:45.117 --> 13:47.619
Professor Rabscuttle.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.664
-Yes. I was wondering---Wandering? Wandering where?

13:50.747 --> 13:54.543
Not wandering off, I hope.Dangerous business, is wandering.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.212
Right! That's enough!

13:57.296 --> 13:59.464
There'll be no wandering.

14:00.048 --> 14:03.177
I want you all to stick togetherand follow me.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.180
Not too close, mind you.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.937
Wow.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.999
Cool! Goo! I love goo.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.586
It's not goo. It's Celestial Clay.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.213
We use it to sculpt life.

14:39.713 --> 14:45.469
Today, we'll be making cottontails,page 5,673.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.971
Remember,follow the instructions carefully,

14:48.055 --> 14:49.973
and if anyone needs me...

14:51.767 --> 14:52.976
I'll be in my box.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.720
I'll need some more clay.

15:28.804 --> 15:31.974
More clay?You should have the exact amount you need.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.309
-But I need to make the wings.-Wings?

15:34.393 --> 15:36.019
Rabbits don't have wings.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.272
Mine does. Look.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.942
Also horns and a few extra feet.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.318
What are those?

15:43.402 --> 15:45.070
Those are fireworks.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.489
It's an explodeling rabbit.

15:48.198 --> 15:52.369
You can't just change the design.The Spryte Handbook is sacred.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.081
You're meant to follow the instructionsto the letter.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.458
-You're just making a blunder.-A what?

15:58.542 --> 16:02.546
A blunder. That's what we call thingswhen they don't turn out right.

16:02.629 --> 16:07.384
How can you look at this cute little faceand call it a blunder?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.846
I'm gonna call her Hopton.

16:10.929 --> 16:14.850
Okay. Is everyone ready?Double-checked your ear length?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.935
Now for the delicate part.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.813
To bring your rabbits to life,

16:19.897 --> 16:24.484
you'll need to tap intothe creative spirit of the Factory.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.830
That's right. Concentrate.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.875
Carefully. Carefully.

16:42.461 --> 16:47.090
Remember,you have to really believe in your rabbit.

17:22.501 --> 17:26.213
What did you expect?I keep telling you, you're not a spryte.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.048
It was worth a try.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.638
You see, Sprout?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.932
I don't know what you think you sawlast night.

17:38.392 --> 17:39.393
Xandra...

17:39.476 --> 17:42.145
-But only sprytes are able to cha---Xandra!

17:42.229 --> 17:43.856
What, Sprout?

17:48.610 --> 17:51.321
What? But how? Did you do this?

17:52.322 --> 17:53.323
I don't know.

17:55.826 --> 17:59.538
Professor Rabscuttle?Professor Rabscuttle!

17:59.621 --> 18:03.709
Yes, yes? Oh, sweet whiskers!What is that?

18:04.293 --> 18:07.087
All right. Nobody panic!

18:07.171 --> 18:09.256
Everybody play dead.

18:11.341 --> 18:14.428
Hey. What's wrong?

18:14.511 --> 18:15.721
It's okay.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.894
-Yep, it's gonna bolt.-I got her!

18:24.104 --> 18:25.147
Wait!

18:32.696 --> 18:34.865
Sprout, just let go!

18:34.948 --> 18:37.367
It's all under control!

18:37.451 --> 18:39.828
This is why we follow the instructions.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.831
Nice Hopton!

18:48.003 --> 18:49.254
Sprout!

19:14.571 --> 19:17.199
Did you really have to give it quills?

19:17.741 --> 19:18.992
Sorry.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.920
Oh, no!That portal leads up to the surface.

20:03.662 --> 20:06.498
Oh, no. It's headed for the Hiccup Lab.

20:17.176 --> 20:20.596
Shoo, hiccuplings! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

20:25.309 --> 20:27.853
Hey, Xandra. Help me with this box.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.330
That should calm her down a bit.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.878
Told you I had it under control.

20:54.046 --> 20:55.339
What do we do now?

20:55.422 --> 20:57.549
We take it to the Blunder Dungeon.

20:57.633 --> 20:58.884
The Blunder Dungeon?

20:58.967 --> 21:03.805
But that sounds awful,and Hopton isn't a blunder.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.558
At least, she wasn't meant to be.

21:06.642 --> 21:07.976
They're never meant to be.

21:08.060 --> 21:11.980
Nobody makes blunders on purpose,but look at all the mess it's made.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.111
It's for the best.

21:45.264 --> 21:48.308
This is the Blunder Dungeon?

21:48.934 --> 21:50.811
Is that a griffin?

21:50.894 --> 21:55.524
And that's a jackalope and a wyvern.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.901
All blunders.

21:57.985 --> 22:01.280
You thinkthese creatures are some kind of mistake?

22:01.363 --> 22:05.742
They're incredible! Way better thanwhatever they were supposed to be.

22:05.826 --> 22:08.328
Shut that gate!

22:08.912 --> 22:12.249
Shut that gate and keep it shut, guys!

22:12.332 --> 22:15.669
Come on, now. We need some control.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.588
You'll let them all out!

22:18.172 --> 22:21.675
And just when humans finally stoppedbelieving in dragons.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.093
Do you work here?

22:23.927 --> 22:25.846
Well, of course I do, little one.

22:25.929 --> 22:29.099
I'm the gamekeeper, at your service.

22:29.183 --> 22:32.269
So, you look after all these creatures?

22:32.352 --> 22:35.939
Yeah, sometimes.And sometimes they look after me.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.733
Yes, you do.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.819
Now then, what's in that box?

22:40.903 --> 22:44.698
It's an explodeling rabbit.She didn't fit in up there.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.284
But I think she'll like it down here.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.746
Well, goodbye then.

22:57.002 --> 23:00.339
Holy molies!I haven't seen one of those before.

23:16.939 --> 23:17.940
Look at that.

23:18.023 --> 23:21.818
The little rascal just needed some roomto let off some steamsies.

23:23.237 --> 23:26.990
She wasn't running away.She just didn't want to hurt anyone.

23:27.074 --> 23:30.285
So what's it called,this explodeling hippety-hop of yours?

23:30.369 --> 23:32.287
-Tell me, please.-Her name is...

23:32.871 --> 23:34.081
Hopton.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.336
I guess blunders can be pretty cool.

23:39.419 --> 23:44.091
It's just a shame no one evergets to see all these beautiful creatures.
