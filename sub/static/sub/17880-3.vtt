00:08.167 --> 00:10.153
<i>This is my daughter Rose.</i>

00:12.165 --> 00:16.065
Her mom ran off to Africa a few years ago
to go save the world.

00:16.271 --> 00:19.422
Here's what I do whenever
I get mad about that.

00:19.631 --> 00:20.881
I love you.

00:21.038 --> 00:23.038
I love you too, daddy.

00:23.795 --> 00:27.123
I'm a dad and I have a job and I really like
keeping those things separate, but

00:27.158 --> 00:28.767
today I can't.

00:29.199 --> 00:32.451
It'll just be for a day or two until I can line up
some after-school child care.

00:32.485 --> 00:34.967
- Our nanny's been off sick.
- Again.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.050
We think she may be pulling a fast one.

00:37.085 --> 00:40.540
You think she's pulling a fast one.
I think she's just sick.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.324
Anyway,

00:42.359 --> 00:46.046
I'd take Rose with me, but I'm working
on a project that's not exactly kid-friendly.

00:46.156 --> 00:49.824
It's no problem. At Veridian
Dynamics, we love children.

00:49.992 --> 00:51.854
Rose, do you like to paint?

00:52.037 --> 00:54.419
- Yes.
- Then you are a lucky girl,

00:54.454 --> 00:58.404
because this morning, we're going to be painting
white lines in the parking structure.

00:59.539 --> 01:01.978
Uh, the kids paint the parking lot?

01:02.028 --> 01:04.352
Not the whole parking lot, just the lines.

01:04.387 --> 01:06.799
- But still, that seems a little-
- Innovative?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.863
It is. At Veridian Dynamics,

01:08.898 --> 01:12.489
we're molding the children of today
into the workers of tomorrow.

01:12.741 --> 01:15.283
Oh, sweetheart, it's not break time yet.
Back to your bench.

01:23.487 --> 01:24.769
You're gonna stay with me today.

01:24.804 --> 01:26.510
But who's gonna paint the parking lot?

01:26.545 --> 01:29.245
Sometimes it's better not to think about things.

01:33.425 --> 01:34.425
Ted,

01:34.544 --> 01:37.307
as you know, we've been having a problem
with false contamination alarms

01:37.342 --> 01:39.492
going off downstairs in the lab.

01:39.609 --> 01:41.457
Until we get to the bottom of it,

01:41.492 --> 01:43.681
well, the company was wondering, well,

01:43.716 --> 01:47.961
since everyone putting on their
hazmat suits is so time-consuming,

01:47.996 --> 01:50.652
maybe we could just not have
them do that anymore.

01:50.794 --> 01:53.786
You want people to not put on their
hazmat suits when they hear an alarm?

01:53.821 --> 01:55.571
If it's a false alarm.

01:55.878 --> 01:57.171
And how would we know that?

01:57.206 --> 02:00.056
Because they're practically all false alarms.

02:02.268 --> 02:03.957
You're not gonna do this.
I can tell.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.475
No.

02:05.704 --> 02:09.592
Uh, by the way, I’m just curious. Did you even
notice I have my daughter with me today?

02:09.627 --> 02:13.590
I look at people's eyes when I talk to them,
Ted, not at their waists.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.304
Hello, sweetheart.

02:15.339 --> 02:16.449
Hello.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.490
We're having a child-care problem.

02:18.525 --> 02:20.582
Oh. Have you checked out Veridian daycare?

02:20.617 --> 02:24.394
Apparently, several of the janitorial staff
came up through there. They rave about it.

02:24.468 --> 02:27.395
Uh, yeah, I’m just a little
overprotective, you know,

02:27.430 --> 02:28.499
since, uh...

02:30.285 --> 02:31.739
her mom left.

02:31.774 --> 02:33.849
Oh. Sad.

02:34.490 --> 02:37.365
Well, you're always welcome
here, daughter of Ted.

02:37.483 --> 02:39.101
- Rose.
- I know her name.

02:39.136 --> 02:41.444
- Rose's name.
- You know, sweetheart, sometimes, your father--

02:41.479 --> 02:43.729
- Ted!
- I know everyone's name.

02:47.144 --> 02:49.571
Once we determined the
type of delivery system,

02:49.606 --> 02:53.576
we examined the drop radius
to target point ratio...

02:53.611 --> 02:55.988
This is why I was worried
about having Rose with me.

02:56.023 --> 02:59.393
Right now we're talking about
a deadly new weapons system, but

02:59.428 --> 03:01.286
in a kid-friendly way.

03:01.321 --> 03:04.521
Next, we looked at what would
happen if we dropped the...

03:06.068 --> 03:07.768
- Bunny.
- Bunny.

03:08.114 --> 03:10.862
from an airplane at 30,000 feet.

03:11.044 --> 03:13.575
You dropped a bunny from an airplane?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.010
Of course not.
Why would we do that?

03:16.404 --> 03:20.101
It's not a real bunny, sweetheart.
It's just a word we're using.

03:20.136 --> 03:21.159
Go on.

03:21.403 --> 03:24.053
At that altitude, the bunny would...

03:24.136 --> 03:27.510
- Cuddle.
- Cuddle everyone within a 2-mile radius.

03:27.545 --> 03:29.861
Within four miles, people would be...

03:31.287 --> 03:35.257
snuggled so badly, they would
have to be hospitalized

03:35.425 --> 03:37.058
with severe burns.

03:37.093 --> 03:40.550
And that's why bunnies
make bad pets. The end.

03:40.585 --> 03:41.837
Thank you, everyone.

03:41.872 --> 03:46.351
For those of you not sure of what's happening,
we'll have this meeting again tomorrow.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.529
- Don't take those down to the lab.
- Why?

03:54.564 --> 03:57.864
Because you'll leave them in
your pocket like you always do.

03:59.724 --> 04:01.218
Now, see, that's more than you took.

04:01.253 --> 04:04.183
I don't even want to know how long you've
been carrying those extra ones around.

04:04.218 --> 04:05.959
So Lem's your boss now?

04:05.994 --> 04:08.448
What? What? No, Lem's not my boss.

04:08.483 --> 04:10.728
- We're equals.
- Why would you think that?

04:10.763 --> 04:14.263
I guess because of the way he was
telling you what to say and do.

04:16.082 --> 04:19.252
Well, you're wrong, because
we're equals. Total equals.

04:19.605 --> 04:20.755
So good-bye.

04:28.380 --> 04:31.341
<i>I was so busy trying to protect
Rose from work,</i>

04:31.376 --> 04:33.718
<i>I didn't think protect work from Rose.</i>

04:33.753 --> 04:37.203
- Can you hand me a clean dropper, please?
- You got it...

04:37.611 --> 04:38.611
Boss.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.300
I knew you wouldn't be
able to let that go.

04:43.542 --> 04:46.450
Not again. It's happening,
like, twice a day now.

04:46.485 --> 04:50.036
- Okay, look, obviously Rose was seeing something, Lem.
- Well, I don't know what,

04:50.071 --> 04:52.967
- because I'm not bossy.
- Maybe sometimes you are.

04:53.002 --> 04:56.611
And maybe it would be helpful
if you could just admit that.

04:56.646 --> 05:00.119
Okay, fine, maybe sometimes
I'm a little bossy.

05:00.554 --> 05:02.448
- Happy now?
- So even you see it.

05:02.483 --> 05:06.233
God. How did I let this
go all these years?

05:11.669 --> 05:13.005
Isn't that cool?

05:13.439 --> 05:15.721
We're not supposed to throw
things at our computers.

05:15.756 --> 05:19.335
See? They even sent a memo about it.
That's what gave me the idea.

05:19.370 --> 05:21.153
What is this stuff, anyway?

05:21.188 --> 05:24.157
Something we invented
for a line of diet foods.

05:24.448 --> 05:27.491
- Yuck. People are gonna eat this?
- Well...

05:28.066 --> 05:29.308
Not knowingly.

05:29.343 --> 05:30.576
Hey, beautiful.

05:31.865 --> 05:32.865
Beautifuls.

05:33.091 --> 05:35.291
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, daddy.

05:35.787 --> 05:37.925
And I'm just never calling you that again.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.978
So thank you for keeping
an eye on her. I had, uh,

05:40.013 --> 05:41.758
that thing, you know.

05:41.903 --> 05:43.353
Gas?

05:45.738 --> 05:48.639
- I know what the kids today like.
- Well, seriously, Linda, thank you.

05:48.897 --> 05:50.931
Seriously, I had a great time.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.389
Here, daddy. I drew this for you.

05:54.424 --> 05:56.846
Oh, thank you. It's, uh,

05:57.125 --> 06:00.378
it's beautiful, honey. Me, you
and Linda all holding hands.

06:00.413 --> 06:01.748
Kids...

06:02.229 --> 06:05.629
God's little awkward-moment machines.

06:05.706 --> 06:09.369
- Um, so you're-you're leaving?
- Uh, I'm meeting my ex-boyfriend for coffee.

06:11.381 --> 06:13.127
I didn't know you had an ex-boyfriend.

06:13.162 --> 06:15.132
I have tons of ex-boyfriends, Ted.

06:16.319 --> 06:19.325
Well, not tons, but many.
A few. Just the right amount.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.188
Anyway, Don's just returned from Paris,

06:21.223 --> 06:24.023
and he wants to get back together, so...

06:25.544 --> 06:27.538
Whoa. Um, do you?

06:28.653 --> 06:30.264
I'm not sure yet.

06:30.299 --> 06:32.131
Do you have a problem with that?

06:32.166 --> 06:33.318
No.

06:34.515 --> 06:35.620
Yes, you do.

06:35.784 --> 06:37.397
Oh, come on, at least have a problem with it.

06:37.482 --> 06:38.907
Okay, maybe.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.948
You don't have a right
to have a problem with it.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.597
You're the one that
blew me off, remember?

06:42.632 --> 06:44.900
"Oh, I'm Ted. I used up my
office affair with Veronica,

06:44.935 --> 06:47.990
so I can never have another one again".
And, yes, that is what you sound like.

06:48.127 --> 06:51.926
- I run the department. I can't afford--
- No, it's fine. I totally get it.

06:51.961 --> 06:55.473
I gotta go. I gotta go meet Don at the
"who cares what people think" cafe.

06:55.508 --> 06:57.740
Where if someone sees something
that they want, they just have it,

06:57.775 --> 06:59.829
and it's the best thing
they've ever had,

06:59.864 --> 07:02.505
because that meal's been
practicing yoga for seven years.

07:03.502 --> 07:06.153
In case you missed it,
by "that meal", I mean me.

07:06.188 --> 07:09.538
I'm bad at metaphors,
but I'm great at sex.

07:11.375 --> 07:12.525
Bye, sweetie.

07:12.740 --> 07:13.840
Bye, Linda.

07:15.631 --> 07:18.522
Oh, Ted, Phil and Lem are having
trouble with the prototype.

07:18.557 --> 07:20.190
Get down to the lab and
see what's going on.

07:20.225 --> 07:22.635
Oh, I can't go now.
I have to watch Rose.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.152
I can wash Rose.

07:24.749 --> 07:27.158
I said "watch" her,
not "wash" her.

07:27.609 --> 07:29.115
Hmm. Even easier.

07:29.255 --> 07:31.522
The fact that you thought I was
gonna go wash Rose right now

07:31.557 --> 07:34.120
makes me think you may not know
that much about children.

07:34.691 --> 07:36.122
I know they need to be cleaned.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.058
Ted, have I ever failed at anything?

07:39.536 --> 07:43.086
No. But you will if you don't go
down to the lab.

07:45.684 --> 07:48.935
Honey, I'm sorry, I can't take you.
There's a lot of dangerous stuff down there.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.796
It's okay. Veronica looks friendly enough.

07:51.831 --> 07:54.140
Thank you. I am friendly enough.

07:54.311 --> 07:55.593
Come on, sweetie.

07:55.628 --> 07:57.478
You have the most beautiful skin.

07:58.002 --> 08:00.613
I wish there was a way I could
peel it off your face

08:00.648 --> 08:02.048
and attach it to mine.

08:02.605 --> 08:06.402
Oh, and then you would grow
new skin and like it just as much.

08:07.638 --> 08:09.121
<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

08:09.786 --> 08:11.056
<i>We're a family, </i>

08:11.091 --> 08:12.533
<i>just like yours.</i>

08:13.144 --> 08:16.089
<i>But we don't waste our time
throwing leaves around.</i>

08:16.124 --> 08:18.924
<i>We put our family to work.</i>

08:19.252 --> 08:20.854
<i>We mean real work,</i>

08:20.889 --> 08:22.798
<i>not just eating mush.</i>

08:22.833 --> 08:27.215
<i>Our Veridian Dynamic family works
for every member of your family,</i>

08:27.842 --> 08:29.420
<i>even the dead ones.</i>

08:29.883 --> 08:32.068
<i>And we're working to bring them back</i>

08:32.102 --> 08:35.264
<i>and copy them, in case you lose them again.</i>

08:35.798 --> 08:37.308
<i>We love our family,</i>

08:37.614 --> 08:41.354
<i>which is why we work nights,
weekends and major holidays,</i>

08:41.782 --> 08:45.782
<i>because that's when families
should be together...</i>

08:45.983 --> 08:48.035
Veridian Dynamics.

08:48.036 --> 08:49.087
Veridian Dynamics.
Family.

08:49.122 --> 08:50.122
Veridian Dynamics.
Family. Yay.

08:54.930 --> 08:55.997
I'm bored.

08:56.561 --> 08:57.561
Not me.

08:59.537 --> 09:01.750
Okay, do you want me
to tell you that joke again?

09:01.785 --> 09:03.306
About the monkey?

09:03.341 --> 09:04.616
I didn't really get it.

09:04.651 --> 09:07.377
Well, you have to know
what stock options are.

09:07.412 --> 09:10.974
I know, but even when you explained it,
it still wasn't funny.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.259
Yes, it was.

09:16.124 --> 09:17.124
Here.

09:18.239 --> 09:20.105
Go over there and study this book.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.050
"The Art Of War"?

09:22.085 --> 09:23.643
I don't want to read this.

09:23.678 --> 09:25.953
Trust me, your enemies are reading it.

09:29.497 --> 09:31.612
- Veronica?
- Mr. Campbell.

09:31.647 --> 09:35.605
Turns out two idiots set off
the contamination alarm.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.317
They are from your department.

09:37.352 --> 09:40.740
What kind of a shop are you running-- ah.

09:41.971 --> 09:44.009
Sorry. There's a child here.

09:46.036 --> 09:48.959
I'm sorry if I was a little
excited just then.

09:48.994 --> 09:51.344
This is Rose. She's very young.

09:51.613 --> 09:53.282
And hates yelling.

09:53.679 --> 09:56.387
Oh, well, I certainly wasn't
yelling at you, Rose.

09:56.564 --> 09:58.891
There was yelling.
That's all she knows.

09:58.926 --> 10:02.976
Rose, darling, come over here so
I can see that you're all right.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.400
Don't be afraid, dear.

10:09.602 --> 10:10.802
Go ahead.

10:11.141 --> 10:14.241
I'm done. Just take care of it, please.

10:16.647 --> 10:18.609
I have a granddaughter your age.

10:21.161 --> 10:25.511
You are very effective at getting
people to control their emotions.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.219
That is a huge asset.

10:29.815 --> 10:30.931
Thank you?

10:31.296 --> 10:32.296
Yes...

10:32.331 --> 10:34.481
"Thank you" is correct.

10:35.571 --> 10:37.588
Hey, guys, Veronica said
there's a problem.

10:37.623 --> 10:39.973
Yes, a child, your child,

10:40.008 --> 10:43.361
thought I was Phil's boss, and
nothing's been the same since.

10:43.396 --> 10:46.011
For such a tiny person, she sure
wreaks a lot of havoc.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.631
Yeah, well, don't worry. We've worked
it out. As everyone knows,

10:48.666 --> 10:51.490
Lem is inherently bossy.

10:51.842 --> 10:55.107
But we've made an adjustment and are
now taking turns being in charge,

10:55.142 --> 10:58.995
so to continue, I've worked out
a series of equations...

10:59.030 --> 11:00.930
Which are totally useless.

11:02.569 --> 11:06.861
- Let me guess. Now Lem's boss.
- For ten unbearable minutes.

11:06.896 --> 11:09.877
Through trial and error, we figured out
that's the longest amount of time

11:09.912 --> 11:11.351
either of us could be boss

11:11.386 --> 11:13.890
before Phil turns into a
complete jackass.

11:13.925 --> 11:18.235
Keep talking, buddy. In nine minutes,
there's going to be a new sheriff in town.

11:18.270 --> 11:21.020
Okay, I think I see the problem here.

11:23.635 --> 11:27.035
And the problem's solved.
So show me the prototype.

11:29.092 --> 11:32.890
You and Hal were setting off those
contamination alarms just for fun?

11:32.925 --> 11:34.877
I'm sorry, Jerry, but we're gonna
have to let you go.

11:34.878 --> 11:36.556
I know what I did was wrong.
I'm sorry.

11:36.591 --> 11:39.128
- I don't know why...
- Please, there's a child here.

11:39.163 --> 11:41.663
- So pull yourself together.
- Oh, right.

11:42.037 --> 11:44.693
- What is she doing here, anyway?
- That's not relevant.

11:44.728 --> 11:48.028
The point is, she's a child,
and she's here.

11:49.801 --> 11:53.031
- Sorry.
- It's okay. I cry, too, sometimes.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.145
Thank you for your composure.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.880
You may go now.
And send in your partner.

12:02.094 --> 12:06.489
I don't know how many firings you've
been involved in, but that went great.

12:06.524 --> 12:10.020
- This was my first.
- You'd never know it.

12:10.055 --> 12:13.401
I bet the next one would go even
smoother if you did it.

12:13.436 --> 12:15.286
You want me to fire someone?

12:15.729 --> 12:17.232
You're hesitating.

12:17.267 --> 12:21.078
Don't ever hesitate, sweetheart.
You're either in, or you're out.

12:21.463 --> 12:25.448
Well, my dad is always telling me not
to be afraid to try new things.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.488
Then you have his blessing.

12:29.908 --> 12:31.935
You two seem to be playing
well together now.

12:31.936 --> 12:34.181
Finish this. I'm gonna go back
upstairs to Rose.

12:34.216 --> 12:37.292
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. You're back early.

12:37.327 --> 12:40.144
- Everything alright with the ex?
- He adores me, Ted.

12:40.179 --> 12:43.396
That's the only way you should interpret
how long I've been out.

12:43.431 --> 12:46.046
- Oh, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

12:49.918 --> 12:51.092
Hey, Lem.

12:52.207 --> 12:55.083
I got a question for you. You've had
a few office affairs, right?

12:55.118 --> 12:56.792
Oh, yeah, I've been all up and
through this place.

12:56.827 --> 12:58.509
Two. He's had two.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.070
And they nearly killed him.

13:01.916 --> 13:03.766
Hide me! Hide me!

13:05.318 --> 13:08.268
It's part of a fun thing I'm doing.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.017
Wait! No, no, no! Why do you
have to be this way?

13:12.052 --> 13:16.378
Look, look, I told you, I told you,
it's only you, okay? It's only you!

13:18.160 --> 13:20.260
Hey, Baby, I was looking for you.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.428
You should read the minutes
from that meeting.

13:29.463 --> 13:33.144
So you'd advise against
multiple office affairs.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.631
Who said that?

13:38.377 --> 13:40.377
It's not that I don't trust you.

13:41.146 --> 13:42.695
Okay, it's that I don't trust you.

13:42.730 --> 13:44.747
We're not children, Ted.

13:45.594 --> 13:48.436
Okay. You have ten minutes and
forty seconds left.

13:48.471 --> 13:50.074
Good. Viva, Lem.

13:50.678 --> 13:52.998
- I've really got to get back upstairs to Rose.
- I'll be quick.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.103
I just wanted to say sorry I gave you
a hard time earlier

13:56.138 --> 13:59.193
about my boyfriend and
how incredibly...

13:59.228 --> 14:00.614
bendable I am.

14:00.649 --> 14:04.009
That's okay. It's not like that's the only thing
I've been thinking about since then.

14:04.855 --> 14:07.173
Oh, god. I've never been down here
for one of these.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.958
I'm sure it's just a false alarm.

14:08.993 --> 14:11.793
We're not liquid, so that's a good sign.

14:12.846 --> 14:15.696
Still, it'd be nice to get to one of those.

14:24.677 --> 14:26.492
Where's the other HAZMAT suit?

14:26.527 --> 14:29.301
I don't know, but it is now...

14:31.281 --> 14:34.532
Your problem. So, boss,
what do we do?

14:35.465 --> 14:36.465
There it is.

14:37.947 --> 14:40.385
Don't worry. It's safe.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.820
Now what?

14:45.163 --> 14:46.325
You take it.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.047
- But... but what if it's not a drill?
- Don't argue with me, Lem.

14:49.082 --> 14:51.999
I am your boss, and
I order you to take it.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.237
But you're the best boss
I've ever had.

14:54.272 --> 14:55.426
Likewise.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.112
What if we took too
long to put these on?

15:01.147 --> 15:03.212
You were the one blocking the closet.

15:03.247 --> 15:06.611
I'm not blaming anyone. I'm just saying,
what if there really were a contamination?

15:06.646 --> 15:08.546
We could both be dead
in a half an hour.

15:10.130 --> 15:12.640
What if this is the last thing I ever do,

15:12.675 --> 15:14.598
the last conversation I ever have,

15:14.633 --> 15:17.453
the last horrible outfit I ever wear?

15:17.488 --> 15:20.758
I'm sure it's just a false alarm, Linda.

15:20.793 --> 15:23.493
The last eyes I ever look into.

15:23.875 --> 15:26.975
I can't think of nicer eyes to look into.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.819
- Oh, Ted.
- Linda.

15:50.803 --> 15:54.110
The hell with it. It's probably
a false alarm, anyway.

15:56.676 --> 16:00.610
Well, now I'm feeling all self-conscious, like,
like I'm being pressured to take off my helmet.

16:00.645 --> 16:05.064
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, you know,
why take the chance?

16:07.275 --> 16:08.349
Hey, guys.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.444
- How many people have to die today?
- We're in lockdown!

16:10.479 --> 16:12.629
Relax. It's another false alarm.

16:13.302 --> 16:14.911
Jerry and I have been setting them off.

16:14.946 --> 16:18.453
I just wanted more break time, and
he went along with it because he's weak.

16:18.488 --> 16:20.478
You know, Hal, I can't just let that go.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.263
Neither could your daughter.
She fired me.

16:23.539 --> 16:25.575
My daughter fired you?

16:25.610 --> 16:27.769
Rose, about the height tall,
hates broccoli?

16:27.804 --> 16:28.815
That's the one.

16:29.575 --> 16:31.575
I have to get upstairs.

16:33.753 --> 16:36.226
- I'm sorry you got fired, Hal.
- Nah, it's cool.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.961
She did a great job.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.472
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, Ted.

16:46.575 --> 16:48.207
Who was in charge when this happened?

16:48.242 --> 16:50.345
No one. We decided to be a team again.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.286
We thought of this together.

17:04.554 --> 17:07.207
Now the trick is to get it super tight.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.092
You see? Power hair.

17:09.855 --> 17:12.755
- Feels weird.
- That'll stop after a few years.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.040
Come on, sweetie. Time to go.

17:17.075 --> 17:18.336
But we're having fun.

17:18.371 --> 17:22.060
Veronica's teaching me what it's like
to be a woman in a man's world.

17:22.096 --> 17:23.510
She has a gift, Ted.

17:23.545 --> 17:25.980
You should've seen how
cleanly she fired Hal.

17:26.015 --> 17:29.017
Yes, I heard.
Say good-bye, Rose.

17:29.675 --> 17:31.901
Good-bye, Veronica.
I had a good time.

17:32.045 --> 17:35.035
Me, too, sweetie.
I'll miss you.

17:36.915 --> 17:39.082
You are a very useful little girl.

17:40.165 --> 17:42.665
Do you have a card or something
you could leave me?

17:52.135 --> 17:55.130
Rose coming to work with me yesterday
made me realize two things.

17:55.165 --> 17:58.865
One, a multinational corporation is
no place for a child.

18:05.495 --> 18:08.495
- Thank you.
- I'm learning a life skill.

18:15.376 --> 18:17.622
I also realized my one-office-affair rule

18:17.657 --> 18:19.932
is a rule I can no longer live by.

18:20.697 --> 18:21.900
I like Linda.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.220
Rose likes Linda.

18:23.255 --> 18:26.480
We went about as far as two people
could go in HAZMAT suits.

18:26.515 --> 18:28.340
I'm ready to take the gloves off...

18:28.375 --> 18:29.677
And the helmet...

18:29.715 --> 18:31.589
And the plastic pants.

18:32.015 --> 18:33.265
But that's crazy.

18:33.735 --> 18:37.635
I'm not calling you crazy, Miriam.
I'm saying it's crazy.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.630
Miriam in payroll is counting my time during
the contamination alert

18:42.665 --> 18:46.061
as break time because, technically,
I wasn't working.

18:46.532 --> 18:47.590
Miriam.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.794
Miriam... Miriam!

18:50.955 --> 18:52.095
I hate Miriam.

18:52.685 --> 18:54.485
I gotta go find her.
Do you know where she is?

18:54.535 --> 18:55.629
India.

18:56.575 --> 19:00.380
See, this is exactly the kind of thing
that makes me want to...

19:00.415 --> 19:02.120
You ever just want to run away?

19:02.155 --> 19:04.450
Oh, sure, yeah, everyone feels
like that sometimes.

19:04.485 --> 19:07.055
No, I mean, really, take off.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.466
Here, look at this.

19:09.675 --> 19:13.670
My mom owns this cabin in Oregon.
Sometimes when things get crazy,

19:13.705 --> 19:16.762
like I come close to death in the lab or
I talk to Miriam in payroll,

19:16.797 --> 19:19.981
I think maybe I should just
take off and go live there.

19:20.016 --> 19:21.820
It's so beautiful.

19:21.855 --> 19:25.290
There's this lake, and it's freezing, but it's,
like, in a good way...

19:25.325 --> 19:29.180
<i>As Linda went on about leaving,
I realized something else.</i>

19:29.215 --> 19:33.226
<i>Yes, she was beautiful and funny and
extremely bendable.</i>

19:33.915 --> 19:38.076
<i>But as a single dad, I had to think
about my daughter first.</i>

19:38.475 --> 19:41.409
<i>Rose already had her mom
abandon her.</i>

19:41.444 --> 19:45.599
<i>I couldn't bring someone else into her life
who might abandon her again.</i>

19:45.600 --> 19:47.880
And this is Gabby.
He lives in a cave nearby.

19:47.915 --> 19:51.010
He makes his own pasta, which is
incredibly hard to do in a cave.

19:51.045 --> 19:52.296
Linda...

19:53.455 --> 19:55.886
- Listen, about yesterday.
- Yeah.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.802
How about that?

19:58.095 --> 20:00.002
It... it can't happen.

20:00.715 --> 20:02.264
- What?
- It's...

20:02.505 --> 20:04.827
It's just not something I can do now.

20:06.025 --> 20:07.660
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

20:07.695 --> 20:08.730
Good.

20:08.765 --> 20:10.439
It clarifies things.

20:10.474 --> 20:13.330
Don's been wanting to know where
he stands, and he's a great guy.

20:13.365 --> 20:16.330
And by "great", I mean he doesn't
make out with me through Plexiglas

20:16.365 --> 20:19.230
and then back off when I'm standing
right in front of him.

20:19.265 --> 20:22.267
- I know. I just...
- Just... go.

20:26.335 --> 20:29.730
Sometimes it's hard to juggle being
a dad with work and relationships.

20:29.765 --> 20:31.890
But at the end of the day,
I got to be a dad,

20:31.925 --> 20:33.412
even if sometimes...

20:34.655 --> 20:36.545
it really hurts.

20:51.275 --> 20:53.991
Well, they're all very cute, but do you
have one with curls?

20:54.026 --> 20:56.610
You know, the kind you just
can't say no to?

20:56.645 --> 20:59.367
Sorry, it's just what you see.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.021
But we do get new ones in every day.
