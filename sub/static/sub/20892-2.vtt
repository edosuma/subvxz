Why did you steal that money?

50:10.640 --> 50:11.640
The machines.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.360
Who got that money?

50:13.960 --> 50:15.680
The machines. Tell the world.

50:17.720 --> 50:19.520
If you don't tell the world,
it's a guilty secret,

50:19.600 --> 50:20.800
that's gonna be revealed, anyway.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.080
If you do tell the world,
it's a campaign.

-What did you do?
-Others will come forward, Roz.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.680
With stories very similar to yours.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.920
We'll get together
and we'll stick together,

50:46.160 --> 50:47.920
till there's not one machine
left in whole of Cross Road.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
What did you do?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.560
Promise me, you'll think about it?

50:50.800 --> 50:52.560
-I promise. What did you do?
-Promise me,

50:52.760 --> 50:55.120
you won't do anything till you've
comeback to see me again?

50:56.200 --> 50:57.200
I promise.

51:00.680 --> 51:02.360
What did you do, Michael?

51:03.680 --> 51:05.480
I'm here to listen to you, Roz, not...

51:07.400 --> 51:08.400
You said...

51:09.680 --> 51:11.440
That you'd done something worse.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.280
Than...

51:16.480 --> 51:19.640
Stealing £200,000.

51:23.480 --> 51:24.480
What was it?

51:28.240 --> 51:30.040
I've done two things worse than that.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.040
One of them is...

51:32.960 --> 51:34.480
Too recent, too raw...

51:35.240 --> 51:36.240
And the...

51:38.720 --> 51:39.720
And the other?

51:55.600 --> 51:56.600

No.

[SCOFFS]

52:00.720 --> 52:01.720
Mary Magdalene?

52:02.480 --> 52:04.640
She'd been there, done it,
bought the t-shirt.

52:05.800 --> 52:06.800
She understood.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.320
I treated young women very badly.

52:15.960 --> 52:16.960
When?

52:18.320 --> 52:20.000
When I was 18, 19...

52:20.840 --> 52:23.880
Not all young women,
just the ones I had sex with.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.200
Why?

52:25.320 --> 52:27.040
Because they let me have sex with 'em.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.400
It's 40 years ago and I could
live with it then, but...

52:33.920 --> 52:37.400
Forty years ago and the only good woman
that I've been with was the Virgin Mary

52:37.480 --> 52:39.080
'cause she never done it with
anyone, whereas...

52:40.320 --> 52:43.800
If a girl did it with a boy...
Any boy, well, she was filth.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.360
And if she did it with a boy like me...

52:48.640 --> 52:49.720
A boy, in whom

52:49.800 --> 52:53.800
every last bit of self-esteem
was well and truly banished, well,

52:54.480 --> 52:56.360
she was less than filth. She was scum.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.280
You can treat scum any way you like.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.560

53:12.280 --> 53:13.640
Sometimes I think

53:14.360 --> 53:16.520
I'll track them down and I'll apologise,

53:16.600 --> 53:18.280
but I don't think I could.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.800
Or should.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.200
Only you know the answer
to that, Michael.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.240
Do I?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.200
Yes.

-Yes. Yes.
