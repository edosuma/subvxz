WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:02.561
- There he is.
- Bless you.

00:02.583 --> 00:04.875
- Do you see it, Billy?
- The pope I do not see.

00:04.959 --> 00:07.041
That right there...
Is that an ear?

00:07.125 --> 00:08.709
No, it's a piece of shit.

00:10.083 --> 00:11.271
For fuck's sake,
get out of my way.

00:11.291 --> 00:12.814
- He's Harrison.
- Who is Harrison?

00:12.834 --> 00:14.114
Somebody that I'm not scared of.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.250
You remember Joe paired
your hand print

00:16.332 --> 00:19.000
- with the emergency console?
- You want me to dock the ship?

00:19.083 --> 00:21.250
You can learn because we have
three-and-a-half years.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.291
Is that enough time?

00:22.375 --> 00:23.855
No. You can't do it.
Who am I kidding?

00:24.083 --> 00:25.438
- We need Judd here.
- How?

00:25.458 --> 00:26.647
We bring him back
on the supply pod.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.021
- Rav!
- Not now!

00:28.041 --> 00:30.201
I'm not going anywhere
until I've launched the shuttle.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.750
If we eject
the equivalent weight

00:33.834 --> 00:35.417
of 500 people...
Pushing us

00:35.625 --> 00:38.375
in striking distance
of Earth within six months.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.041
Non-essential items

00:40.125 --> 00:42.250
to the hallway for jettisoning.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.667
You can follow my lead.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.000
I overpacked.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.333
Thank you,
you may join the line.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.083
So, what non-essential items

01:05.166 --> 01:06.709
will you be getting rid of
today?

01:06.792 --> 01:08.291
I've got two pairs of shoes.

01:08.375 --> 01:12.000
No. You cannot
and you will not lose these.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.208
- Thank you.
- What do you know?

01:14.291 --> 01:17.542
Jettison the loafers,
we keep the heels.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.125
- These are my only shoes.
- Honey.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.166
Count yourself lucky.
Karen tried to get rid of me.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.959
I mean, we have
complementary slippers, so...

01:25.041 --> 01:26.625
- Thank you, join the line.
- Thank you.

01:26.709 --> 01:28.250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:28.333 --> 01:29.208
They didn't laugh.

01:29.291 --> 01:30.792
- At what, sweetie?
- My joke.

01:30.875 --> 01:33.500
I was implying
I was non-essential,

01:33.583 --> 01:35.000
but they took it seriously.

01:35.083 --> 01:39.125
It was insanely funny. I was
just laughing on the inside.

01:39.208 --> 01:43.000
Hi, sweetie. What have you got
for me today?

01:43.083 --> 01:46.500
My. This is a tough
life lesson, right?

01:46.583 --> 01:48.709
Sorry I'm late.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.667
Just been depositing
ten kilos of emotional baggage

01:51.750 --> 01:53.500
with Karen,
the Empress of the Jetsam.

01:53.583 --> 01:56.230
If you're late when
it comes to flying this thing for real,

01:56.250 --> 01:57.417
we're all gonna die.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.333
- Okay.
- All right.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.875
So, let's just get you settled,
and...

02:01.959 --> 02:03.166
'Kay, no, hold on.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.000
Can you... Could you... just
give me a little bit of space?

02:06.083 --> 02:07.709
Feels like I'm trying to urinate

02:07.792 --> 02:09.375
in front of
a war crimes tribunal.

02:09.458 --> 02:11.397
- What an image. Okay.
- Thank you very much.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.458
- Thank you.
- Guys, just give him some room.

02:13.542 --> 02:17.208
- Okay, so...
- Yeah. Can I adjust the seat?

02:17.291 --> 02:18.458
No, the seat is...

02:20.000 --> 02:22.625
- That's too high.
- Yeah. So, can...

02:23.625 --> 02:25.166
That's probably too low.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.792
Yeah. Okay...
Can you just leave

02:26.875 --> 02:28.772
- leave the fucking seat...
- Fucking seat alone. Right.

02:28.792 --> 02:29.959
Yeah, leave that alone.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.875
Okay, let's begin.

02:31.959 --> 02:34.250
- Starting the engine.
- Wait, wait! No!

02:34.333 --> 02:36.667
Because the laterals
are still engaged. So...

02:36.750 --> 02:38.208
Stopping the engine

02:38.291 --> 02:41.417
and disengaging the laterals,
whatever they are.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.542
How do I do that?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.291
- Come on. Come on, man.
- No.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.897
- This is physically hurting me.
- Just give him a second, he's working it out.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.438
- This is his process.
- This is... This is... Why didn't they just

02:49.458 --> 02:52.417
have a button that says "disengage..."
Look, they have... look!

02:52.500 --> 02:54.458
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Can I press it?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.583
At this point, I'm beginning
to wonder.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.417
Wait. Yay. You can.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.917
Now I start the engine.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.583
No, because you've got
to clear the filters,

03:02.667 --> 03:03.709
which you do...

03:03.792 --> 03:06.792
- before you ignite...
- After I ignite the eng...

03:08.583 --> 03:10.417
Is that a good explosion?

03:10.500 --> 03:12.583
Well, we were in it.

03:12.667 --> 03:16.500
Each item, ask yourself,
"Would I exchange that trinket

03:16.583 --> 03:18.709
for a human life?"
Because basically,

03:18.792 --> 03:21.417
everything we own right now,
blood diamonds.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.083
Hey, how 'bout this?

03:23.166 --> 03:25.166
It's like an estate sale,
and we're not even dead.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.417
I'm doing my part.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.417
- Hey, Fudd!
- Fuck.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.000
Have a look at these winners.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.709
You know, these are
more valuable to me

03:31.792 --> 03:34.542
than my previous
and current wives combined.

03:34.625 --> 03:35.667
Yeah?

03:35.750 --> 03:38.959
Well, I'm more about
personal responsibility,

03:39.041 --> 03:41.458
which is why I'm donating
a Beatle skull.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.709
Paul. No, wait, George.

03:43.792 --> 03:46.709
Smaller cranium,
protruding mandible.

03:49.625 --> 03:51.917
Well...

03:52.000 --> 03:53.458
Something in the way he moves.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.622
What are your plans
for your skull when you die?

03:55.667 --> 03:57.000
I would love to drink
out of that.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.959
You threatening my skull?

03:59.041 --> 04:00.721
Is he threatening to drink
out of my skull?

04:00.750 --> 04:02.430
Why would you let him
talk to me like that?

04:02.458 --> 04:03.709
I'll never let it happen again.

04:03.792 --> 04:06.375
You know, I can't wait to see
you led away in shackles,

04:06.458 --> 04:08.917
like the leisure industry
huckster you are.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.834
Good luck jettisoning
those babies.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.041
Okay, so concentrate.

04:13.125 --> 04:15.166
- Right hand, left foot.
- Right hand, left...

04:15.250 --> 04:18.416
- Left hand, left foot. Ignite...
- ...foot. Left hand, left...

04:18.500 --> 04:21.000
- ...and throttle up for downward motion.
- What is this?

04:21.083 --> 04:23.291
- Right hand, right foot.
- Fucking country dancing?

04:23.375 --> 04:25.667
- Okay, come here! Let me...
- Just let go, all right?

04:25.750 --> 04:27.875
I can do this.
I'm not in a care home.

04:27.959 --> 04:31.125
Okay. I want you to increase
the thrust.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.125
Ease up. Ease up.

04:33.208 --> 04:35.125
- Ease up! Ease up!
- Is...? Is that...?

04:35.208 --> 04:38.083
Hey, little man.
Here's what we're gonna do.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.250
You're gonna thank him
for his service,

04:40.333 --> 04:42.041
and then send him to his death.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.333
Yes!

04:44.417 --> 04:47.250
Hey, Matt. You know what?
Screw Harrison.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.792
Anyway, stuff's just stuff.

04:48.875 --> 04:51.041
What's more important
is "people."

04:51.125 --> 04:52.333
Sir, you're doing it again.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.041
You're air quoting
around "people."

04:54.125 --> 04:56.458
Look, hypothetically,

04:56.542 --> 04:58.792
if I were to just disappear,

04:58.875 --> 05:00.917
she wouldn't know what to do
with herself.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.083
She'd be a fucking train wreck.
An absolute mess.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.417
You can still see me, right?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.250
I'm non-hypothetically
right here.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.792
So I need you to promise me
to work with her, Matt,

05:10.875 --> 05:12.583
in the event of my departure.

05:12.667 --> 05:15.583
- I get it. You're diseased.
- No.

05:15.667 --> 05:18.250
A shuttle is coming to Avenue 5,

05:18.333 --> 05:21.166
and they only have room for one
passenger to return to Earth.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.959
I'm going.
It's, the...

05:25.041 --> 05:27.333
- Ultimate sacrifice.
- Ultimate sacrifice.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.792
I'm leaving so that

05:28.875 --> 05:31.625
everyone else on the ship
has a chance.

05:31.709 --> 05:34.166
Are you sure you're comfortable
leaving us

05:34.250 --> 05:36.166
in the incapable hands
of a captain

05:36.250 --> 05:37.875
who has a serious addiction
problem?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.188
What? Addiction?

05:39.208 --> 05:41.583
- He is slamming sedatives.
- What?

05:41.667 --> 05:43.166
And who knows what else?

05:43.250 --> 05:46.041
Hypnotics, opiates, floaters,

05:46.125 --> 05:48.083
- whompers, daddy dust.
- No.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.522
- Could be.
- No. No!

05:49.542 --> 05:52.417
Not with a J on his uniform,
he's not. Iris!

05:52.500 --> 05:54.041
I'm right here.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.105
Oh, shitty biscuits!

05:56.125 --> 05:58.689
That's a hundred dead.
Five hundred dead. Seven hund...

05:58.709 --> 06:00.563
- Two thousand dead, 25...
- Just keep going...

06:00.583 --> 06:02.522
- That wasn't right. Damn it.
- Three thousand! Three thousand...

06:02.542 --> 06:05.188
- Four thousand! Five thousand.
- God, what are those? Are those body parts?

06:05.208 --> 06:07.583
Why would you simulate body parts?

06:07.667 --> 06:10.500
And that, Billie, is...

06:10.583 --> 06:13.000
how you crash, okay?

06:13.083 --> 06:14.625
So let's try and remember that.

06:14.709 --> 06:18.000
It's right hand, left foot,
left hand, left foot.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.500
Okay? Gorgeous.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.583
She's a little, a little slow.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.397
That's the first time
you got it right.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.730
I was just making it up.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.291
So, what do you guys...

06:26.375 --> 06:28.230
- Yeah, how can we help you?
- What do you guys need?

06:28.250 --> 06:30.792
We thought that
Tabasco storage was in here.

06:30.875 --> 06:31.834
Well, it's not.

06:31.917 --> 06:34.125
Well, I'm kinda having
a Bloody Mary emergency.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.083
Yeah. You guys know Bloody Mary?

06:36.166 --> 06:37.605
It's an old drink named
after this woman

06:37.625 --> 06:39.625
who liked to set Protestants
on fire.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.542
It's delish, and we need
Tabasco for it.

06:42.291 --> 06:43.667
I like this.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.125
Shabby chic.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.083
That's funny.
It's mean, though.

06:49.166 --> 06:50.333
Yeah, what goes on here?

06:50.417 --> 06:52.458
There's a lot of tech
for a locker room.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.083
But it is just that.

06:54.166 --> 06:57.625
It's just a u... storage unit
cum clubhouse.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.792
Cum clubhouse?

06:58.875 --> 07:00.625
- We just...
- We... We... We...

07:00.709 --> 07:01.917
- hang out.
- Hang out.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.730
- She wants us to leave, Spike.
- Okay.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.500
Yeah, they probably got
some freaky roleplay going on.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.375
I will get you that Bloody Mary.

07:08.458 --> 07:11.375
I swear this
on the blood of Mary.

07:11.458 --> 07:13.667
I'm gonna die! Oh, shit!

07:13.750 --> 07:14.834
Hairy balls.

07:14.917 --> 07:19.917
Exiting Earth's atmosphere
in three, two, one...

07:24.750 --> 07:26.458
There. Feeling better?

07:26.542 --> 07:27.750
Stopped squeaking?

07:27.834 --> 07:30.041
Good.

07:30.125 --> 07:33.750
Right, I'm just gonna listen
to this true crime podcast

07:33.834 --> 07:35.583
about that Greta Gerwig thing.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.387
Yeah, everyone's got
a theory about that.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.625
Yeah.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.583
So...

07:43.041 --> 07:45.458
Do you do these trips often?

07:48.125 --> 07:50.208
Well, I'm a pilot, so...

07:50.291 --> 07:52.041
- yeah.
- Yeah.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.375
Fancy a job swap?
You can run Mission Control.

07:54.458 --> 07:57.750
Oh, god no.
Jesus Christ.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.917
It's a shit show.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.500
- Not if I see you first.
- Okay, Captain.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.875
Great.
Am I about to get whacked?

08:08.959 --> 08:10.125
This is an intervention.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.375
Exciting.
Who's getting intervented?

08:12.458 --> 08:14.750
I know about the drugs, Ryan.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.500
- The drugs?
- Don't be a junkie.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.417
Don't destroy that perfect skin.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.625
You think I...
The sedatives were for you!

08:22.709 --> 08:24.625
I don't need sedatives.

08:24.709 --> 08:27.542
There is no one on this ship
who needs sedatives more.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.375
You're like a whole zoo escaped.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.625
I was trying to give everyone
a break.

08:31.709 --> 08:33.958
- Iris!
- I'm right here.

08:34.041 --> 08:36.082
This is...
This is a public area situation.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.291
He tried...

08:37.375 --> 08:39.166
to mutiny against me.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.250
She was in on it!

08:41.332 --> 08:44.000
That is so absurd,
I don't even need to deny it.

08:44.082 --> 08:47.041
Iris, you are presently
shitting me.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.313
If it's all the same, Iris,
I'd like to hear you deny it.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.291
- Denied.
- There you go. Perfect. See?

08:51.375 --> 08:54.083
I mean, look at him.
Junkie fuck.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.417
He'd slash his nana's throat
for half an Advil.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.375
Okay, well, if we're done here,

08:58.458 --> 08:59.605
I have an appointment
on the bridge,

08:59.625 --> 09:01.917
exchanging synthetic bollocks
with the crew.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.959
No! I forbid it! You're fired!

09:06.041 --> 09:08.291
What?

09:08.375 --> 09:09.959
- Sir.
- Got that?

09:10.041 --> 09:12.250
You are stood down
from your position

09:12.333 --> 09:14.458
- pending immediate court-martial.
- Am I?

09:14.542 --> 09:15.980
Actually, we don't have
the facility...

09:16.000 --> 09:17.397
- Do we have a brig?
- You're just upset

09:17.417 --> 09:19.355
- about the way Harrison spoke to you.
- I wanna see you rot

09:19.375 --> 09:20.959
- in space prison.
- Space prison?

09:21.041 --> 09:22.561
Let's climb down
from a place of anger.

09:22.625 --> 09:25.125
I don't get angry.
I have two emotions.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.291
- Yeah?
- Elation and genius.

09:27.375 --> 09:29.917
- You are de-captained.
- What are you doing? No, no, no!

09:30.000 --> 09:31.291
No, no. No, let...

09:31.375 --> 09:33.021
- Okay......
- Right, that is it!

09:33.041 --> 09:34.417
I've had enough. All right?

09:34.500 --> 09:38.291
I am not bowing and scraping
to a demented child any longer!

09:38.375 --> 09:40.667
She's not a child.
She's a grown woman!

09:40.750 --> 09:42.000
- What?
- I'm talking about you!

09:42.083 --> 09:43.208
Well, fuck you then!

09:43.291 --> 09:45.333
No more tugging my forelock!

09:45.417 --> 09:47.625
In fact, you can fucking have
my forelock.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.000
Oh my god!
He's taking his head off!

09:51.083 --> 09:52.897
What are you doing?
That's disgusting!

09:52.917 --> 09:54.605
Oh my god,
he's taking off his head!

09:54.625 --> 09:56.917
- Is he removing a microchip?
- Is he an android?

09:57.000 --> 10:00.208
Is that a hairpiece?
You're British and bald?

10:00.291 --> 10:02.125
Balding! Balding!

10:02.208 --> 10:03.500
His lovely, lovely hair!

10:03.583 --> 10:07.000
Re-hair yourself! Please!
I'll re-captain you!

10:07.083 --> 10:08.500
Actually, that's an order!

10:08.583 --> 10:10.397
- Put that thing back on!
- No. No. You can't give me orders anymore.

10:10.417 --> 10:11.605
- What?
- 'Cause I'm a civilian.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.542
All right, coming through,
coming through!

10:13.625 --> 10:16.333
Chief petty passenger.
I'm one of you now.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.834
This wall, seems awfully curvy.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.750
Why have they done that?
One star, I think.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.875
Fuck you, Captain Opioid!

10:23.959 --> 10:28.750
I'm gonna take this filthy hair
to clean my shower...

10:28.834 --> 10:31.083
and my own balls!

10:31.166 --> 10:33.000
I've got a loofah!

10:33.959 --> 10:35.375
Hey!

10:35.458 --> 10:37.667
I want this ship re-captained.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.917
Nitro level is good.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.375
Looking real good, ladies.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.792
Beautiful orbit. Okay.

10:46.875 --> 10:49.750
Okay, radial axis parameters?

10:52.458 --> 10:56.375
Modular... nomination units
scanning all fields?

10:56.458 --> 11:00.667
Good. It's not what I asked,
but switch it to manual, please.

11:00.750 --> 11:01.834
Oh, shit. Really?

11:01.917 --> 11:03.500
Yeah. I can't wait.

11:03.583 --> 11:04.542
I got this.

11:04.625 --> 11:05.542
Yeah.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.980
Now, let's see
if these old fingers

11:07.000 --> 11:08.917
can still tickle a big gal.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.291
Well, that's weird.
It's not responding.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.667
None of it responds.
Look, if I just...

11:17.750 --> 11:19.146
Just sort of improv it.

11:19.166 --> 11:22.291
Okay, if this is hazing
'cause it's my first day,

11:22.375 --> 11:23.375
I don't appreciate it.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.375
No, no, it's great.
It's just...

11:25.458 --> 11:27.333
you know, mime it a bit.

11:27.417 --> 11:30.709
Okay, I'm just gonna go
to comms.

11:31.834 --> 11:32.959
Fuck's sake.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.875
Is that junk for my collection?

11:35.959 --> 11:37.709
Well, firstly, this is not junk,

11:37.792 --> 11:40.125
and secondly, it's not really
your collection.

11:40.208 --> 11:43.041
Well, I've been put in charge
of it, so...

11:43.125 --> 11:44.965
Well, I don't know who put you
in charge of it,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.875
but this was my idea. I mean,
you should be using this stuff

11:47.959 --> 11:49.583
to build a statue of me.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.834
Maybe you could donate
your incredibly big head.

11:53.917 --> 11:55.875
I was only joking.

11:55.959 --> 11:57.583
She's not really
getting jokes today.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.417
- Frank.
- Hi, question.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.625
If we really are moving
at thousands of miles an hour,

12:01.709 --> 12:02.989
how come it doesn't feel
like it?

12:03.041 --> 12:05.750
I don't have time to explain
all of physics to you.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.083
Okay, you don't have to explain
all of physics to me,

12:08.166 --> 12:11.250
I work in VFX.
It stands for visual effects?

12:11.333 --> 12:14.208
Well, I would like to see
a visual effect of you

12:14.291 --> 12:16.792
- not talking to me.
- Okay, rude.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.083
Billie is only 30 percent
flesh and blood.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.291
The rest is... I don't know.
Bone?

12:21.375 --> 12:23.291
And I'm still waiting
on your ten kilos.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.667
You want a donation?

12:24.750 --> 12:26.291
I don't want this.

12:26.375 --> 12:29.542
Well. Why don't you take one
of these stupid heavy things...

12:29.625 --> 12:32.000
It's actually quite light.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.750
There are a lot of them,
and they're completely useless,

12:34.834 --> 12:39.083
so there is your donation,
and you're welcome.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.583
- That came off pretty easy.
- Yeah.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.208
- Put it back, Frank.
- Feel like a movie set.

12:45.291 --> 12:46.730
- Yeah.
- You know, I should know.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.814
I... I actually...
I'm around movie sets a lot.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.542
I work in VFX.
Stands for visual effects.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.959
I mean, things might blow over,
though.

13:00.041 --> 13:02.166
You know, while you're up on,
Avenue 5.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.875
Yeah, well, I think it'll take

13:03.959 --> 13:06.709
more than a couple of days
to blow over.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.166
Well, you're gonna be
more than a couple of days.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.333
Sorry, sorry.
I'm not staying on Avenue 5.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.834
I'm grabbing Mr. Judd,
and then we are going back.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.417
Yeah... we're going back.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.709
Yes, we're going back.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.146
Yeah, but my "we're"
or your "we're"?

13:22.166 --> 13:23.646
I feel like we're at crossed
"we'res."

13:23.709 --> 13:25.834
We are... Look, you, me,
and Mr. Judd.

13:25.917 --> 13:27.834
We are all going back to Earth.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.041
Not if Mr. Judd
is on this shuttle, you're not.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.083
Well, can you give me
one good reason why not?

13:32.166 --> 13:34.834
I can give you two.
Count the seats.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.063
Hurry up.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.772
- Hesitation gives me headache.
- All right, sorry,

13:39.792 --> 13:40.959
I'm a buffet virgin.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.397
Hey, grandpa, can you hurry up?

13:42.417 --> 13:44.698
- Trying to get to the bacon.
- I'm getting gang buffeted.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.208
What are you doing?

13:55.291 --> 13:56.583
Well, I'm... I'm just...

13:56.667 --> 13:58.730
You just swipe it like this.
It's really not hard, you know?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.709
- Okay. All right. Sorry.
- Jesus.

14:01.834 --> 14:02.834
Problem paying?

14:02.917 --> 14:05.208
Yes. I don't know why.
It just seems to...

14:05.291 --> 14:07.458
It doesn't come up.
Is it... Is it okay

14:07.542 --> 14:09.105
- if I take this and just...
- Sorry, sir.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.285
I can't allow you to do that.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.542
You're down as a passenger now.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.166
- So... just...
- I'm... What? I'm not...

14:15.250 --> 14:16.667
I see what he's done.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.083
So, what do I do?
I just eat the furniture?

14:19.166 --> 14:20.500
Hey. Everything okay?

14:20.583 --> 14:23.250
He doesn't have any Judd Bucks
in his account.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.417
Matt, tell him, will you?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.333
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- Okay.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.291
Come here.

14:28.375 --> 14:30.417
I'm probably gonna have to
call security on you,

14:30.500 --> 14:32.542
but I promise I'll give you
a big head start.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.917
And don't try to hide
in your cabin.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.750
'Cause Judd gave it to Spike.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.959
Right.
So that's his game, is it?

14:40.125 --> 14:41.792
Okay, well,
I've got another game

14:41.875 --> 14:43.417
that I'm playing. It's called...

14:46.542 --> 14:48.375
Yeah, it's okay. Names are hard.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.834
No, I've got it. It's called...

14:50.917 --> 14:55.041
It's called "Fuck You
in the Stupid Fucking Face

14:56.041 --> 14:58.375
and I Hope Your Spaceship
Fucking Crashes.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.125
- Fuck You" is what it's called.
- Yeah.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.667
That sounds like a good game.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.208
This has got to be

15:04.291 --> 15:06.291
the greatest yard sale
of all time.

15:06.375 --> 15:10.417
Hello. Hello, thank you
for your service. Yes. Yes.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.792
You know, this is how I made
my first ten bucks.

15:12.875 --> 15:15.041
I thought you stole it
from your dad.

15:15.125 --> 15:16.625
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I get confused.

15:16.709 --> 15:19.083
That's what happens when
you write three autobiographies.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.772
Don't worry, I got this.

15:20.792 --> 15:23.208
Fudd.
I know.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.166
What do you know?
Your own limitations?

15:25.250 --> 15:29.041
No. I know about
the shuttle, small balls.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.397
There's no space
on that shuttle.

15:30.417 --> 15:31.834
What shuttle?
Fuck, shit.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.230
You should have said
the second part

15:33.250 --> 15:34.170
and not the first part.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.647
When this is over,
you'll be in prison,

15:35.667 --> 15:37.875
doing business via a phone
stored up your own asshole

15:37.959 --> 15:40.291
whilst I'll be running
my new space travel company,

15:40.375 --> 15:42.000
one that gets
its passengers home

15:42.083 --> 15:44.250
before their kids die
of old age.

15:44.333 --> 15:45.897
- No, you arsehole.
- What...?

15:45.917 --> 15:48.125
- You'll be making children...
- What are you d...?

15:48.208 --> 15:50.041
...and yanking
on your knickerbocker

15:50.125 --> 15:51.897
- while it makes goof juice.
- That... None...

15:51.917 --> 15:54.166
- None of that is English.
- You know what I'll be doing?

15:54.250 --> 15:57.875
I'll be back
in my home rebuilding my empire.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.500
With what? Your own dung?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.625
No, not my dung. Idiot.

16:01.709 --> 16:03.375
Zing.

16:03.458 --> 16:06.188
You let me in on the shuttle, and
I'll drop all my lawsuits against you.

16:06.208 --> 16:08.875
Back off, buddy,
or you will feel my wrath.

16:08.959 --> 16:12.208
And I am fire.
Literally fire.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.417
I will burn the jelly
in your fat eyes,

16:14.500 --> 16:17.083
and use your tongue
to wipe surfaces with.

16:17.166 --> 16:20.291
I want you both to know
that I am not afraid of women.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.333
I simply now choose
to walk away.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.041
- You mincing narcissist.
- Iris.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.291
You've erased me.
What am I supposed to do?

16:30.375 --> 16:32.625
What am I supposed to eat?
Where am I supposed to sleep?

16:32.709 --> 16:34.709
I'm as mad as a fucking bear.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.792
Call security. There's
a bald hobo threatening me.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.500
- I just did.
- They shaved Samson.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.208
I have more hair than him.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.375
Oh my god!
What has happened to you?

16:43.458 --> 16:44.709
Did security do this to you?

16:44.792 --> 16:45.959
- I quit.
- I fired him.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.250
So, you don't have to teach me
how to bloody fly!

16:48.333 --> 16:49.693
- Why would he quit?
- I fired him.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.917
- Why would you fire him?
- Well, technically, he quit.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.041
- You can't fly?
- You're British?

16:54.125 --> 16:56.750
Boom,
and the fourth wall shatters.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.083
What else isn't real?

16:58.166 --> 16:59.689
I mean, he's out of his hair
and makeup.

16:59.709 --> 17:02.166
He doesn't have his costume on.
We're in a reality show.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.021
I bet we're not even in space!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.666
You guys are stupid,
even for rich people.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.165
Hey, hey. Don't talk
to rich people like that.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.125
We could just walk out
the airlock?

17:11.208 --> 17:12.980
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no, no!

17:13.000 --> 17:14.771
- Come on! Let's get outta here.
- No, no, no, no, no!

17:14.791 --> 17:16.438
- You can't walk, okay?
- No! No, no, no! No, no.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.083
You can't do that
because you'll die.

17:18.165 --> 17:19.646
Okay, you're just saying that
to keep us here

17:19.666 --> 17:21.916
- on your ridiculous space show.
- What?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.250
Great, the captain's here.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.333
I just found out something
freaky about the bridge.

17:26.416 --> 17:30.083
Yes, that it is incredibly
high tech and sophisticated...

17:30.166 --> 17:32.083
The crew is being prompted.

17:32.166 --> 17:34.250
Someone is telling them
what to say.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.792
What?
You mean the crew isn't real?

17:36.875 --> 17:38.458
Well, the captain's
not even American.

17:38.542 --> 17:39.625
- He's British.
- Yeah!

17:39.709 --> 17:43.625
Look, we all put on accents
when we're in character.

17:43.709 --> 17:45.458
That's what actors do.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.625
Like this, for example, is me
just being Sarah.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.875
But this is me being "Sarah."

17:53.166 --> 17:54.458
So, you are an actor?

17:54.542 --> 17:57.166
- Wait. You are? She is?
- It sounded the same.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.542
No, no, it's very subtle.
She's doing with her eyes.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.250
Yeah, I don't want
to give the game away.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.542
Okay, so it is a game.
Okay, let's go.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.583
No, no, no, no. Please, please,
don't listen to her.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.000
She doesn't know anything.
She's legally a simpleton.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.500
Billie, distract her.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.146
- Shine a torch at the ceiling or something.
- Why so rude?

18:12.166 --> 18:14.166
Wait a second,
so are you an actor?

18:14.250 --> 18:16.250
Well, if you're
noticing me acting,

18:16.333 --> 18:18.834
then I would say that actually,
I'm not doing my job properly.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.417
Everything is fake.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.063
Guys, that's why they're making us
throw out all of our belongings, okay?

18:23.083 --> 18:25.166
It's some sort of test
or competition.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.250
I think she's
one of their stooges.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.875
Would a stooge threaten
to sock you in the T-I-T-S?

18:33.250 --> 18:34.667
We are still on Earth.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.166
These people are so dumb.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.834
I am just hanging out with pigs
and dolphins when we get back.

18:38.917 --> 18:39.834
I get it, I get it.

18:39.917 --> 18:42.000
Everyone, we're still on Earth!

18:42.083 --> 18:45.333
No, everyone... Mia, stop!
You are being hysterical.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.875
I'm so confused!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.500
Doug, you can suck on this!

18:48.583 --> 18:51.041
Our son!
He's still waiting for us!

18:51.125 --> 18:53.625
- We can go home now!
- We're already home!

18:53.709 --> 18:55.792
We can just walk out
of the airlock!

18:55.875 --> 18:57.875
Get out of the way,
ya fake fuck!

18:57.959 --> 19:00.041
I'm getting off this ship!

19:00.125 --> 19:01.625
Any of you... No!

19:10.542 --> 19:12.250
Com tell me how this works!
Make it work!

19:12.333 --> 19:14.667
Okay, I got it!
You go get your boy.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.208
I cannot believe
you are making me

19:17.291 --> 19:19.041
save your simple little lives!

19:19.125 --> 19:21.709
There is real space out there,
and it's real cold.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.875
You go out there,
you will freeze,

19:23.959 --> 19:26.208
- and you will die.
- No, that is not true!

19:26.291 --> 19:28.458
Are you just gonna stand there?
Do something!

19:28.542 --> 19:31.208
I see.
So, just as these halfwits

19:31.291 --> 19:34.125
are dribbling down
into quarterwits, I'm back.

19:34.208 --> 19:37.125
That's great. So, I get
my room and I get food?

19:37.208 --> 19:39.000
Wh... Why do you have
the captain's wig?

19:40.667 --> 19:43.041
'Cause I fancy him a bit.

19:43.125 --> 19:47.625
Is that... Is that
character Sarah or you Sarah?

19:48.291 --> 19:50.583
Honestly, I don't know.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.834
Go! Go save my fucking ship.
Please.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.750
I don't know why you think
you're right and I am wrong.

19:55.834 --> 19:58.355
- Because I work in VFX.
- That stands for visual effects.

19:58.375 --> 20:00.563
- Visual effects.
- I know what it fucking stands for!

20:00.583 --> 20:02.542
What do you mean, ""?

20:02.625 --> 20:04.417
Okay, okay, okay! Listen!

20:04.500 --> 20:06.542
Listen, listen!

20:06.625 --> 20:08.583
I have also been out there,

20:08.667 --> 20:12.417
and let me tell you,
it is real and it is horrible.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.875
- It's real?
- Yes.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.792
Like your hair is real?

20:15.875 --> 20:18.458
Fake captain, fake wig!

20:18.542 --> 20:20.397
Well, you know what?
His beard is a different color

20:20.417 --> 20:21.959
than his hair.
Maybe it's a wig!

20:22.041 --> 20:24.000
Iris! Iris! Iris!
My hair hurts!

20:24.083 --> 20:26.021
- Why is she hurting my hair?
- Get your grubby hands...

20:26.041 --> 20:27.709
I can't even touch his hair!

20:27.792 --> 20:29.291
They're your people.
They're idiots.

20:29.375 --> 20:30.709
Speak idiot to them!

20:30.792 --> 20:33.208
Okay, listen, listen, everybody.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.417
You do not want to go out there.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.041
- Because if you do...
- See?!

20:37.125 --> 20:39.625
- Shit!
- Signs fall off the wall.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.333
- It's like a set!
- It's fake!

20:41.417 --> 20:44.792
W... Wait. No, no, it's not fake.
It's just cheap. Cost effective.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.375
We are in a simulation!

20:47.458 --> 20:50.875
Don't be as stupid as your face!

20:50.959 --> 20:52.583
Hey!
He can't help his face!

20:52.667 --> 20:54.041
Well, I mean...

20:54.125 --> 20:56.333
I believe you!

20:56.417 --> 20:57.667
We're in a simulation.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.750
No. Matt,
Matt, this is not the time.

20:59.834 --> 21:04.333
But it is the universe that is
the simulation, not the ship.

21:04.417 --> 21:05.667
Universe?

21:05.750 --> 21:09.000
The smallest subatomic particles
we can see look like pixels.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.959
This is all a game.

21:11.041 --> 21:12.375
But it feels real,

21:12.458 --> 21:14.458
and if you go out there,

21:14.542 --> 21:16.917
you will die
within the simulation.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.939
- Okay, that... That actually is pretty good.
- Yeah.

21:20.959 --> 21:24.041
And the fact that you left your
son in a coma back on Earth

21:24.125 --> 21:25.667
does not make you a bad person.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.917
But look, I mean,
if you wanna go out...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.458
you can go out.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.291
The code
is five-three-three-five.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.000
You can do it.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.959
- No, no...
- I mean, free will, right?

21:36.041 --> 21:38.792
But I think...
in your heart,

21:38.875 --> 21:41.625
you're 99 percent sure
that that's wrong.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.875
I'm gonna do it.

21:44.959 --> 21:47.583
Something has felt fucked up
on this ship from the start.

21:47.667 --> 21:49.083
Mia! No!

21:49.166 --> 21:50.959
- No, don't, don't, don't!
- Wait, what?

21:51.041 --> 21:52.481
Yeah, I... I'm just,
I'm just sayin'.

21:52.542 --> 21:53.959
Just don't go!

21:54.041 --> 21:56.166
I will... I will donate
my golf clubs.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.291
- What?
- Yes.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.875
To jettison, okay?

21:58.959 --> 22:01.313
- Can you guys? There's a sig...
- This needs to hit... Here.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.980
Sir, you're in the way. Actually,

22:03.000 --> 22:04.208
stay exactly where you are...

22:04.291 --> 22:06.480
Jared! Daddy's coming!

22:13.291 --> 22:14.417
No! No!

22:15.625 --> 22:16.792
Mike, no!

22:17.917 --> 22:19.417
No, no, no!

22:19.500 --> 22:21.291
Jared! I'm coming, son!

22:35.291 --> 22:36.375
Mike?

22:38.166 --> 22:40.750
It's VFX, guys.

22:40.834 --> 22:41.959
Visual effects.

22:42.041 --> 22:44.458
It's a projection.
It's not even very good ones.

22:44.542 --> 22:46.302
That guy is gonna be
headed to the green room

22:46.333 --> 22:48.542
- any minute now.
- Yeah, the green room.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.500
What? No, no...
What are you talking about?

22:50.583 --> 22:52.355
He's gonna go
to the green room. He's fine.

22:52.375 --> 22:53.709
He's a desiccated man!

22:53.792 --> 22:56.750
We just saw a man
become desiccated!

22:56.834 --> 22:58.000
Oh, god.

23:01.959 --> 23:02.875
You saved me, Doug.

23:02.959 --> 23:04.834
I couldn't watch you
go in there.

23:04.917 --> 23:08.041
- Thank you.
- I want you here with me.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.959
You can't just save my life.
You gotta make it about you.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.000
- No... For fuck's sake.
- This is classic.

23:13.083 --> 23:16.417
Fudd. You're playing me.
Aren't you?

23:16.500 --> 23:20.208
Absolutely not. I don't know
what the fuck is going on.

23:20.291 --> 23:22.397
I should've known a real trip
to Saturn was beyond you,

23:22.417 --> 23:24.625
- ya small-time huckster.
- What? No.

23:24.709 --> 23:28.959
See you back home,
crying probably, in court.

23:29.041 --> 23:32.875
Harrison,
we really are in space.

23:32.959 --> 23:34.041
I think.

23:34.125 --> 23:36.291
You're so cute
when you're lying.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.188
All right. No, no, no, no.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.667
What's your next move?

23:39.750 --> 23:42.583
That's a good question.
Thought I might twat you one?

23:43.041 --> 23:44.375
Go ahead.

23:44.458 --> 23:46.041
I like being hit.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.166
- That's...
- Billie, twat the gentleman.

23:48.250 --> 23:50.125
- Me? Right. Yes. Listen.
- Will you? Yeah.

23:50.208 --> 23:51.959
- Mr....
- She's got an E! Okay!

23:52.041 --> 23:54.500
Anybody who wants
1000 new bucks,

23:54.583 --> 23:56.959
help me escape!

23:57.041 --> 24:00.375
Use your fucking code!
Five-three-three-five!

24:05.250 --> 24:07.375
No! No...

24:07.458 --> 24:09.208
I'm scared! I'm so scared!

24:09.291 --> 24:13.083
Joke's on you,
Herman, you big assho...

24:22.250 --> 24:24.625
If these are effects,
they're pretty darn good.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.875
Okay. Anyone else

24:35.959 --> 24:37.834
- think it's a game show?
- Sarah.

24:37.917 --> 24:40.250
No, no, no, no, no!

24:49.208 --> 24:52.000
- Yeah!
- Take me, Jesus!

24:52.083 --> 24:54.000
Eat my asshole!

24:54.083 --> 24:55.667
Actually, I've changed my...

25:07.166 --> 25:08.917
Now, why would they do that
as an effect?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.166
I have no idea that that's
what would even happen.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.834
Well, you laughing gnome.

25:16.917 --> 25:19.375
You still think
it's visual fucking effects?

25:19.458 --> 25:22.417
I... Well, the F doesn't
stand for "fucking,"

25:22.500 --> 25:25.250
and I will admit
that I'm on the fence.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.188
- You're on the fence?
- I'm on the fence.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.750
They're not on the fence.

25:28.834 --> 25:31.000
You put them on the fence,
and they disintegrate.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.834
Holy shit.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.083
Is it my fault?

25:37.166 --> 25:39.208
Well, you know,
it's not not your fault.

25:39.291 --> 25:40.583
I was trying to help, and...

25:40.667 --> 25:42.667
Your arguments were confusing.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.417
Everything's a simulation?

25:44.500 --> 25:46.438
And... and a one percent chance
they could get home?

25:46.458 --> 25:48.208
Where did you get
the one percent?

25:49.625 --> 25:51.125
I was trying to be nuanced.

25:51.208 --> 25:55.166
Nuanced? Well, I think
you just nuanced them to death.

25:55.250 --> 25:58.792
Yes. That is exactly
what happened here today.

25:58.875 --> 26:01.792
Matthew nuanced seven people
to death.

26:01.875 --> 26:03.315
There's plenty of blame
to go around.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.208
We are all gonna get a slice.

26:05.291 --> 26:06.875
Oh shit...

26:07.959 --> 26:09.792
Message from Earth.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.959
Their son just woke up
from his coma.

26:13.041 --> 26:14.667
He wants to know
where his parents are.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.000
- Oh, god.
- That's not good.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.375
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

26:20.291 --> 26:22.875
Matt, can I leave that one
with you?

26:36.083 --> 26:38.542
Hello! Hi.

26:38.625 --> 26:42.041
I don't wanna have to
fight you for a place home.

26:42.125 --> 26:43.165
- Rav, Rav, Rav.
- But I...

26:43.208 --> 26:44.750
Okay, look, I'm the pilot.

26:44.834 --> 26:46.709
I'm going home,
whatever happens.

26:46.792 --> 26:49.750
The passenger is either you
or Mr. Judd

26:49.834 --> 26:50.959
or both of you

26:51.041 --> 26:53.750
if one of you
has eaten the other.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.250
Okay?

26:55.875 --> 26:56.917
Okay.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.625
I mean, it might not be so bad.

27:01.709 --> 27:04.500
No press.
Illuminated turd shows.

27:04.583 --> 27:08.667
- Buffets. Cruise life.
- Cruisin'!

27:08.750 --> 27:10.458
I can do this, right?

27:12.417 --> 27:14.188
- Get me home! Get me home right now!
- Damn it! I can't!

27:14.208 --> 27:15.709
- It's automated!
- Do something!

27:15.792 --> 27:17.855
- Let go of my arm! Let go of my arm!
- I'm afraid! I'm very scared!

27:17.875 --> 27:20.792
I can't... Help! Oh shit!

28:25.000 --> 28:26.500
I got a message from Matt.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.333
"I have changed the codes
to the airlock.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.250
No more deaths,
no more tragedies."

28:31.333 --> 28:32.583
That's good. That's smart.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.000
How are we supposed to jettison
all this stuff now?

28:35.083 --> 28:36.625
What Matt wrote is dumb.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.647
- We are gonna find him.
- Have you seen the tall weirdo?

28:39.667 --> 28:41.563
We're gonna get the code,
and we're gonna kill him.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.792
If we can't jettison
the stuff in the next hour,

28:43.875 --> 28:46.583
we're in this for
the long three and a half years.

28:47.041 --> 28:49.291
I already lost seven good souls.

28:49.375 --> 28:51.083
- I'm not gonna lose an eighth.
- Eleven.

28:51.166 --> 28:53.291
- What?
- You've lost 11 good souls in total.
