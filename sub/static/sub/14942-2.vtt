abandoning Lacey comment,

06:01.692 --> 06:03.433
I just...

06:03.434 --> 06:06.566
Uh, she's got minor cuts
and abrasions from the fall.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.568
What I meant to say was
that sometimes, you just seem

06:08.569 --> 06:10.440
so stuck on how things are
supposed to be with Lacey

06:10.441 --> 06:12.472
instead of just
letting it happen.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.603
Look. She did her own nails.

06:13.604 --> 06:15.374

manicure for a trophy wife.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.618
The nail is pulled down to
the bed. (Camera shutter clicks)

06:28.619 --> 06:31.461
And there's some
kind of pigment or paint

06:31.462 --> 06:32.622

06:32.623 --> 06:34.424
(Footsteps approach)

loeb of killing his wife?

06:35.766 --> 06:37.767
Well, somebody shot her.

06:37.768 --> 06:41.400
It is a homicide, isn't it,
until proven otherwise?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.732

06:44.575 --> 06:47.737
Not coincidentally, guess
who I just got off the phone with.

06:47.738 --> 06:49.609
I will be more
delicate next time.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.410
No, you won't.
You're off the case.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.683

one call to the mayor,

07:23.574 --> 07:24.774
Who knew that one of
the perks of being rich

07:24.775 --> 07:26.516
is that you get to handpick

07:26.517 --> 07:28.518
your own personal, kiss
ass medical examiner?!

07:28.519 --> 07:30.820
Megan, Julie doesn't
come from money, okay?

07:30.821 --> 07:32.752
That's not what I'm saying.
I-I know what you're saying,

07:32.753 --> 07:34.624
and I'm serious. She
is not a trophy wife.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.486
She's a scholarship
kid from upper darby.

07:36.487 --> 07:38.488
Okay, she and Martin
met a few years ago,

07:38.489 --> 07:39.759
but she did not want to get
involved with a married man.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.561
They didn't even start dating

07:41.562 --> 07:43.563
until after he
divorced his first wife.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.694
Great. So she's a
woman of principles.

07:44.695 --> 07:46.636

one that gets the bullet.

You know as well as I do,

07:52.743 --> 07:54.744
the investigator
stays with the body.

07:54.745 --> 07:57.747
Am I wrong, or are you
two fighting over me?

07:57.748 --> 08:00.611
You can have him.

08:03.854 --> 08:06.687

Transportation
needs another driver.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.808
You know anybody?

08:28.809 --> 08:30.810
I know lots of people who
drive. Why'd I even ask you?

08:30.811 --> 08:33.583
Okay, you know, just tell me
what the job requirements are.

08:33.584 --> 08:35.585
Prior experience picking
up and unloading bodies.

08:35.586 --> 08:37.547
It takes a certain personality.

08:37.548 --> 08:39.549
Uh-huh. I mean, how exactly
do you get prior experience

08:39.550 --> 08:41.691
picking up and unloading bodies? Is
this the evidence from the Julie loeb exam?

08:41.692 --> 08:44.624
Yes, those are going
out for processing.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.755
Get both of these typed.

08:45.756 --> 08:46.896
I thought you
were off this case.

08:46.897 --> 08:48.698
I am not off this case

08:48.699 --> 08:50.630
until I find out who
shot that woman.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.762
Okay.

08:52.763 --> 08:55.605
I think I'll go check
on her blood tox.

08:55.606 --> 08:57.637
(Indistinct conversations)

08:57.638 --> 08:59.669
I'm just your bitch, aren't I?

08:59.670 --> 09:01.572
Stop pretending
you don't like it.

09:02.773 --> 09:04.574
One-night stand?

09:04.575 --> 09:06.916
That's just Megan
stirring the pot.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.619
Listen, you do understand
that me taking this case

09:09.620 --> 09:11.721
has nothing to do
with my dating Todd?

09:11.722 --> 09:13.583
I didn't think it did.

09:13.584 --> 09:16.726
Uh-huh. But you think I
shouldn't be dating Todd.

09:16.727 --> 09:17.857
I have three sisters, okay?

09:17.858 --> 09:19.659
There is no way that I
am getting in the middle

09:19.660 --> 09:20.830
of this catfight.

09:20.831 --> 09:23.733
Who said anything
about a catfight?

09:23.734 --> 09:25.665
(Morris) This is our problem.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.667
This is where Julie was shot.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.970
And this is where each of
you was standing at the time.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.972
According to this, none of you

09:32.973 --> 09:34.974
had direct line
of sight with Julie.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.877
So either there was
another shooter out there

09:37.878 --> 09:40.680
that no one saw
and left no trace

09:40.681 --> 09:42.912
or one of you is lying.

09:42.913 --> 09:45.855
We came down here
today as a courtesy.

09:45.856 --> 09:47.787
Despite the way we
were treated this morning,

09:47.788 --> 09:49.959
and now you're accusing
one of us of lying?

09:49.960 --> 09:51.961
What's she doing here?

09:51.962 --> 09:53.823
What was the fight
about, Mr. Loeb?

09:53.824 --> 09:55.625
You're not supposed
to be on this case.

09:55.626 --> 09:57.727
Dr. Hunt, you don't
want to do this.

09:57.728 --> 09:58.998
Julie's blood type
was o positive,

09:58.999 --> 10:01.831
and yet, the blood
that I found on her nail

10:01.832 --> 10:03.833
and the blood from
the scratch on your neck

10:03.834 --> 10:05.635
was b negative.

10:05.636 --> 10:07.807
Your blood type, Mr. Loeb.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.879
Martin... (Coughs)
I'm not a lawyer,

10:09.880 --> 10:12.882
but they can't take your
blood without your permission.

10:12.883 --> 10:14.744
Shouldn't have dropped that
tissue. Dad, let's get outta here.

10:14.745 --> 10:15.915
Sit.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.987
You and Julie had a fight.
She scratched your neck.

10:17.988 --> 10:21.721
You saw your opportunity in
the woods, so you shot her.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.992
That is twice in one day

10:22.993 --> 10:24.854
you've accused me of
killing the woman I love.

10:24.855 --> 10:27.658
Was there a fight, Mr. Loeb?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.961
There was no fight.

10:31.962 --> 10:33.863
Julie doted on me...

10:33.864 --> 10:35.665
Included little things,

10:35.666 --> 10:37.938
uh, tying my tie...

10:38.969 --> 10:41.811
Helping me put on
my hunting jacket.

10:41.812 --> 10:43.973
She must have had a
hangnail that caught on my neck.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.975
At the time, I thought
it was a zipper.

10:45.976 --> 10:48.718
When you asked me about
it, I'd forgotten the whole thing.

10:48.719 --> 10:51.752
And now I think we're
done being insulted.

10:53.924 --> 10:54.954
(Man speaks indistinctly)

10:54.955 --> 10:56.956
(Morris) You've
already lost one career.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.028
You trying to make it two?

11:02.793 --> 11:03.863
(Camera shutter clicks)

11:03.864 --> 11:04.994
The bullet blew up
the c-4 vertebrae

11:04.995 --> 11:06.866
after transecting
the spinal cord.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.768
So the bullet did kill her?

11:08.769 --> 11:09.969
Of course it killed her.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.841
Megan said it was the fall.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.843
Well... well, if you want
to get technical about it,

11:13.844 --> 11:16.846
yeah, the path of the bullet
missed the vertebral arteries.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.948
It was the bone fragments that
lacerated them during the fall.

11:18.949 --> 11:21.851
There's some
foreign matter in here.

11:21.852 --> 11:24.784
(Indistinct conversations)

11:24.785 --> 11:26.856
(Camera shutter clicks)
Megan said it was a quick death.

11:26.857 --> 11:29.088
You gonna keep throwing
Megan at me the whole time?

11:29.089 --> 11:30.820
I'm not throwing anything
at anybody. Mm-hmm.

11:30.821 --> 11:33.993
I am Switzerland,
okay? I'm a neutral party.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.766
Listen, I haven't
done anything wrong.

11:36.767 --> 11:37.927
Well, technically.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.799
So you do think it's wrong.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.931
(Laughs) No, I don't.

11:41.932 --> 11:44.874
Well, unless the only
reason that you're dating him

11:44.875 --> 11:46.876
is because you think
that it can't work out.

11:46.877 --> 11:48.778
Sort of like your
one-night stand?

11:48.779 --> 11:50.940
Tox report on Julie's blood.

11:50.941 --> 11:54.013
No drugs, no
medications, no alcohol.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.815
Want to know why?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.088
Elevated levels of beta h.C.G.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.122
This was a double homicide.

12:03.954 --> 12:06.757
Julie loeb was pregnant.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.734
(Indistinct conversations)

12:20.410 --> 12:23.272
How's the Julie loeb case going?

12:23.273 --> 12:25.444
Oh, I am Switzerland.
I'm neutral.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.317
Okay. Just out of curiosity,

12:28.318 --> 12:29.478
which one of us is Germany?

12:29.479 --> 12:31.480
I am not getting in the
middle of this catfight, okay?

12:31.481 --> 12:33.752
(Scoffs) I don't do catfights.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.455
(Laughs)

12:38.488 --> 12:40.489
Julie was pregnant?

12:40.490 --> 12:43.292
Yes, she was... pregnant.

12:43.293 --> 12:44.493
That's a motive.

12:44.494 --> 12:46.495
Yeah, the police are following
up on that at this very moment.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.767
And speaking of police,
I just had a charming call

12:48.768 --> 12:50.369
from lieutenant Pierce

12:50.370 --> 12:52.341
regarding your latest
run-in with Martin loeb.

12:52.342 --> 12:53.803
I was right about his
blood on Julie's nail.

12:53.804 --> 12:55.404
You were wrong about pursuing

12:55.405 --> 12:56.545
a case that's not yours,
and if you do it again,

12:56.546 --> 12:58.277
I'm gonna assign
you to transportation.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.448
They're looking for a driver.

12:59.449 --> 13:01.781
Do I make myself clear?

13:03.513 --> 13:05.784
Yes. Good.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.316
Now since apparently
taking you off the case

13:07.317 --> 13:09.358
isn't enough to actually
get you off a case,

13:09.359 --> 13:11.360
I'm assigning you another one.

13:11.361 --> 13:15.265
A man found downtown, killed
by blunt-force trauma to the head.

13:16.326 --> 13:18.828
Uh, w-what about
my investigator?

13:18.829 --> 13:21.401
We do have more than one.

13:23.573 --> 13:26.435
You've driven for
a hospital, I see.

13:26.436 --> 13:27.506
Yes, sir. Six months.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.807
Now that's not long.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.509
Are you okay with
seeing massive trauma?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.411
You know, severed limbs,

13:32.412 --> 13:33.582
exposed brains,

13:33.583 --> 13:37.286
uh, legs bent the wrong
way, that sort of thing.

13:37.287 --> 13:39.448
You know, 'cause in this
office, we cut people open.

13:39.449 --> 13:41.550
You might see stomach contents,

13:41.551 --> 13:43.452
organs, all kinds of...
(Strained voice) Yeah.

13:43.453 --> 13:45.855
Sure. That's not...
that's not gonna be a...

13:45.856 --> 13:48.597
(Vomits and coughs)

13:48.598 --> 13:52.401
You are Martin loeb's
business manager?

13:52.402 --> 13:54.563
Yes. And I've known
him for 20 years.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.365
He didn't shoot Julie.

13:56.366 --> 13:57.536
Mm. Did you?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.308
Of course not.

13:59.309 --> 14:00.569
Did you know Julie was pregnant?

14:00.570 --> 14:02.371
She told me about a month ago.

14:02.372 --> 14:03.512
Funny Martin didn't mention it.

14:03.513 --> 14:04.843
She hadn't told him.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.515
She wanted to get past
the 3-month threshold.

14:06.516 --> 14:08.317
Then why tell you?

14:08.318 --> 14:09.518
She came to me
for financial advice.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.620
She wanted to make sure
her children were taken care of.

14:11.621 --> 14:13.352
You mean in Martin's will?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.453
I was preparing an audit

14:14.454 --> 14:16.425
of Martin's assets
for the attorneys.

14:16.426 --> 14:17.526
Did you say children, plural?

14:17.527 --> 14:19.428
She wanted more than one.

14:19.429 --> 14:20.589
And who would object
to changing Martin's will

14:20.590 --> 14:22.561
to include new heirs?

14:22.562 --> 14:25.864
I can think of at least three
people... his kids and his ex.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.368
His ex wouldn't happen to have
hunting experience, would she?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.569
Alexandra? She's the one

14:30.570 --> 14:32.572
that got Martin into
hunting in the first place.

14:34.404 --> 14:37.407
(Police radio chatter)

14:39.409 --> 14:42.411
(Radio chatter continues)

14:42.412 --> 14:43.652
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

14:43.653 --> 14:47.556
You know, this is our
first crime scene together.

14:47.557 --> 14:48.918
Do you do yoga?

14:48.919 --> 14:50.619
What?

14:50.620 --> 14:53.522
Close your eyes.

14:53.523 --> 14:54.593
Whoa.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.425
Breathe deeply.

14:56.426 --> 14:57.496
(Inhales deeply)

14:57.497 --> 15:00.499
Try to clear your
mind. Now open them.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.502
Tell me what you see without
prejudice or precondition.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.634
There's a dead
guy in the street.

15:05.635 --> 15:07.636
And?

15:07.637 --> 15:08.907
(Sighs)

15:08.908 --> 15:10.609
I'm a forensic pathology fellow.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.911
You need a medicolegal
death investigator. I'm sorry.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.544
Don't worry. There's one
around here somewhere.

15:15.545 --> 15:17.416
(Ethan clears throat)

15:17.417 --> 15:20.489
What does an
investigator do, actually?

15:20.490 --> 15:24.393
Basically, secures
the crime scene,

15:24.394 --> 15:28.497
photographs the body,
interviews witnesses,

15:28.498 --> 15:30.559
and whatever I tell 'em to do.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.931
But I already do
whatever you tell me to do.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.503
Keep up the good work.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.405
(Chuckles) (Man) Excuse me.

15:36.406 --> 15:38.667
I'm detective bell.
This is detective Lopez.

15:38.668 --> 15:41.670
Dr. Hunt. Where's
my investigator?

15:41.671 --> 15:43.442
Called to another scene.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.713
Uh, I'm Dr. Ethan
gross. I'm... Ethan.

15:44.714 --> 15:46.445
Yeah? Start taking pictures.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.418
Right.

15:49.619 --> 15:51.981
(Camera shutter clicking)

15:51.982 --> 15:54.583
So... does our
victim have a name?

15:54.584 --> 15:56.585
Patrick deline, age 33.

15:56.586 --> 15:58.727
Well-dressed, well-groomed,
caught in a bad part of town.

15:58.728 --> 16:00.529
We figure he came from the burbs

16:00.530 --> 16:02.631
to score some drugs
and someone jacked him.

16:02.632 --> 16:03.962
Fits the pattern around here.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.995
Blunt-force trauma to the head.

16:05.996 --> 16:08.437
So what kind of drugs was
he trying to score, guys?

16:08.438 --> 16:09.738
(Lopez) What's your pleasure?

16:09.739 --> 16:12.442
There's a park up the street.
It's a shooter's paradise.

16:14.004 --> 16:15.574
(Click)

16:15.575 --> 16:17.446
This guy was no shooter.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.478
And as for jacking...

16:19.479 --> 16:20.709
(Jangles)

16:20.710 --> 16:22.451
Ah.

16:22.452 --> 16:24.513
(Car alarm chirps)

16:24.514 --> 16:25.614
(Chirp)

16:25.615 --> 16:27.586
(Police radio chatter)

16:27.587 --> 16:28.988
You need a new theory.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.691
Autopsy...

16:32.692 --> 16:34.523
Two hours.

16:34.524 --> 16:37.467
Bye, officers.

16:41.031 --> 16:45.604
Oh, what about
these? You like these?

16:45.605 --> 16:48.537
I'm looking for
something really specific.

16:48.538 --> 16:51.009
Oh, okay.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.681
Good to know.

16:52.682 --> 16:54.783
How specific?

16:54.784 --> 16:56.745
These.

16:56.746 --> 16:58.747
Aren't they sexy?

16:58.748 --> 17:01.490
Uh, yeah.

17:01.491 --> 17:03.492
Uh, mm, well, you know,

17:03.493 --> 17:06.495
I'm not sure these are
quite right for you. Um...

17:06.496 --> 17:07.596
What do you mean?

17:07.597 --> 17:09.728
I tried on a pair of Kate's,
and they looked great.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.701
(Indistinct conversations)

17:12.702 --> 17:15.665
(Sighs)

17:17.036 --> 17:19.508
So after you drove
for a mortuary,

17:19.509 --> 17:21.570
you drove an ice
cream delivery truck?

17:21.571 --> 17:23.813
I like little kids.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.647
Oh.

17:32.522 --> 17:34.583
What do you want
to know, detectives?

17:34.584 --> 17:36.054
Did I kill Julie?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.658
As long as you're offering.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.661
Children, leave.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.062
Mom.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.664
Don't worry.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.098
I'm gonna confess to
exactly what you think I will.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.548
I hate the bastard.

17:59.549 --> 18:00.779
Wouldn't you?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.682
25 years of marriage,
and like some old car,

18:03.683 --> 18:05.814
he trades me in
for a newer model.

18:05.815 --> 18:08.617
But you didn't kill Julie.

18:08.618 --> 18:11.660
Detective, I made out
just fine in the divorce.

18:11.661 --> 18:14.693
And I doubt very
much I'm still in his will.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.095
But your children
are, aren't they?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.627
(Inhales sharply)

18:18.628 --> 18:19.828
(Woman) Our mother was angry,

18:19.829 --> 18:21.700
sure, but who wouldn't be?

18:21.701 --> 18:24.102
Well, your mother gets
nothing from your father's will.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.834
But you two
stand to inherit less

18:25.835 --> 18:28.106
every time Julie has a child.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.139
Do you know how
much our father is worth?

18:30.140 --> 18:31.640
Approximately $100 million.

18:31.641 --> 18:33.642
Right, so that's
$50 million each,

18:33.643 --> 18:35.884
$33 million split 3 ways,

18:35.885 --> 18:37.816
and $25 million split 4 ways.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.818
Sure, our inheritance
will be reduced,

18:39.819 --> 18:43.122
but not enough to commit murder.

18:44.854 --> 18:46.856
She do all the talking?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.861
We weren't happy
about the divorce.

18:52.862 --> 18:55.834
We didn't give Julie
a warm welcome.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.667
But dad loved her,
and she loved him.

18:58.668 --> 19:00.809
All you had to do
was see them together.

19:00.810 --> 19:03.173
She was the love of his life.

19:05.615 --> 19:06.675
(Sighs)

19:06.676 --> 19:09.679
(Whistling)

19:11.651 --> 19:13.151
You're whistling.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.753
Well, it's nice
talking to people

19:14.754 --> 19:16.885
without Megan tossing
verbal grenades everywhere.

19:16.886 --> 19:19.858
Mnh-mnh. You only
whistle for two reasons.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.160
Either you've been to the opera

19:22.161 --> 19:23.632
or you got...

19:23.633 --> 19:25.734
I am sleeping in
my own bed again,

19:25.735 --> 19:27.636
if that's what
you're getting at.

19:27.637 --> 19:29.698
Congratulations, player.
How much did that cost you?

19:29.699 --> 19:31.770
18 years and counting.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.172
So what do we think
about this bunch?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.704
Well, they've got
the best motive

19:35.705 --> 19:37.646
I've heard so far...

19:37.647 --> 19:39.678
Money.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.710
(Peter) Kate.

19:41.711 --> 19:44.182
Look, I know that Megan
can be exasperating at times,

19:44.183 --> 19:45.914
but she's usually
right. Meaning what?

19:45.915 --> 19:47.216
Meaning that maybe
Julie's pregnancy

19:47.217 --> 19:48.917
had something to
do with her death.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.659
How so?

19:50.660 --> 19:52.661
Well, I did a paternity
test on Julie's embryo,

19:52.662 --> 19:54.224
and Martin loeb
is not the father.

20:04.734 --> 20:06.735
Julie was pregnant?

20:06.736 --> 20:09.508
(Sam) You didn't know?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.811
I knew we were trying.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.815
Oh, god. I can't believe this.

20:17.747 --> 20:21.550
Would it surprise you to
learn you weren't the father?

20:21.551 --> 20:23.692
You understand where
we're going with this.

20:23.693 --> 20:26.755
Julie was having an affair,
she became pregnant,

20:26.756 --> 20:29.498
you found out it
wasn't your baby.

20:29.499 --> 20:30.699
Now when did you discover

20:30.700 --> 20:33.602
that she was trying to
write the baby into your will?

20:33.603 --> 20:36.565
My god.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.567
(Chuckles) You people really are

20:38.568 --> 20:40.709
trying to find me guilty
of something, aren't you?

20:40.710 --> 20:42.811
I couldn't be the father.

20:42.812 --> 20:45.774
Five years ago, I
had prostate surgery.

20:45.775 --> 20:47.617
I'm sterile.

20:48.778 --> 20:50.849
I knew Julie wanted children.

20:50.850 --> 20:54.653
She was going to a sperm bank,

20:54.654 --> 20:56.526
and she had my blessing.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.589
Do you happen to know which one?

21:00.590 --> 21:01.730
I said she had my blessing.

21:01.731 --> 21:05.694
It doesn't mean I wanted
to know every detail.

21:05.695 --> 21:06.895
(Telephone rings)

21:06.896 --> 21:08.838
Atlantic reproductive services.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.673
Uh-huh. It's totally anonymous.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.675
No, you don't need
an appointment.

21:16.676 --> 21:17.876
(Lowered voice) Fill this
out. I'll be right with you.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.548
(Lowered voice) I'm not
actually here for this. I...

21:19.549 --> 21:20.679
(normal voice)
Uh-huh. (Object thuds)

21:20.680 --> 21:21.780
We're located
downtown near city hall.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.813
Yep. That's the
one. Open till 5:00.

21:24.814 --> 21:25.914
(Receiver clatters)

21:25.915 --> 21:27.586
(Sighs)

21:27.587 --> 21:29.788
We provide all the
visual material you need.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.890
(Laughs) That's...
That is good to know,

21:31.891 --> 21:33.792
but I, uh, I was wondering

21:33.793 --> 21:36.796
if you've ever seen
this woman before.

21:40.770 --> 21:42.902
So you're not here
to give a sample?

21:44.774 --> 21:47.906
You listed your
mother as a reference?

21:47.907 --> 21:50.639
Yeah. She thinks I'm great.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.840
You want to call her?

21:51.841 --> 21:53.742
(Laughs) No. (Drops pen)

21:53.743 --> 21:55.714
(Chuckles)

21:55.715 --> 21:56.785
Just so you know,

21:56.786 --> 21:58.587
my investigator was
called off the scene.

21:58.588 --> 21:59.718
That was him.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.919
There was a crane
accident at the rail yard.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.792
Nice shoes.

22:03.793 --> 22:04.923
Thank you.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.725
I could see Lacey in those.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.798
I don't see her in a
pair of bondage pumps.

22:09.799 --> 22:11.600
Care to clue me in?

22:11.601 --> 22:12.801
We went shopping.

22:12.802 --> 22:15.604
Lacey picked out a pair of shoes
that apparently you showed her.

22:15.605 --> 22:16.805
I showed her?

22:16.806 --> 22:18.967
Next time she wants something,
just send her to me, please.

22:18.968 --> 22:21.710
So are you telling me that
I'm not allowed to wear shoes

22:21.711 --> 22:22.971
in front of your daughter?

22:22.972 --> 22:24.713
I'm telling you that
you are in her life

22:24.714 --> 22:25.844
whether I like it or not,

22:25.845 --> 22:27.646
and you just need to
understand your role.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.648
And what would that be?

22:29.649 --> 22:31.620
I don't know. I'm still
trying to figure that out.

22:31.621 --> 22:32.821
Okay, see if this helps.

22:32.822 --> 22:34.753
I don't have a role, all right?

22:34.754 --> 22:37.926
I can't control what Lacey
sees or what she likes

22:37.927 --> 22:40.689
any more than I can control
you when you go mouthing off

22:40.690 --> 22:41.890
to a suspect in a homicide.

22:41.891 --> 22:44.693
I am not trying to
be Lacey's mother

22:44.694 --> 22:45.894
any more than I want
to be your mother,

22:45.895 --> 22:47.696
and quite frankly,

22:47.697 --> 22:49.738
I'm getting a little sick of
you putting me in that position.

22:49.739 --> 22:50.869
So whatever's going on
between you and Lacey,

22:50.870 --> 22:52.000
figure it out for yourselves

22:52.001 --> 22:54.703
'cause I don't
want any part of it.

22:54.704 --> 22:56.705
(Woman) Dr. Hunt, detective
bell and Lopez are here

22:56.706 --> 22:58.907
for Patrick deline's autopsy.

22:58.908 --> 23:00.909
You put yourself through college

23:00.910 --> 23:03.652
working as a driver for
a supermarket chain?

23:03.653 --> 23:04.853
That's right.

23:04.854 --> 23:07.656
I have time on
forklifts, boom lifts,

23:07.657 --> 23:09.788
pallet loaders, uh,
every kind of truck,

23:09.789 --> 23:12.721
from minivans to 18-wheelers.

23:12.722 --> 23:14.863
Oh, and I do have the
licenses to go with them.

23:14.864 --> 23:16.825
Well, Theresa, I gotta tell
you... (Cell phone rings)

23:16.826 --> 23:18.767
I am very, very...

23:18.768 --> 23:21.670
(Laughs and speaks indistinctly)

23:21.671 --> 23:23.672
(Clicks keypad keys)

23:23.673 --> 23:24.673
(Laughs)

23:24.674 --> 23:26.676
Impressed.

23:27.807 --> 23:28.937
(Camera shutter clicks)

23:28.938 --> 23:32.010
So you're the ex neurosurgeon?

23:32.011 --> 23:33.712
We asked around.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.943
What else did you hear? Ethan.

23:34.944 --> 23:36.815
(Ethan) What? So do
we have a cause of death?

23:36.816 --> 23:38.687
Depressed skull fractures

23:38.688 --> 23:40.689
to the occiput and
temporal parietal regions

23:40.690 --> 23:43.021
causing massive
cerebral contusions

23:43.022 --> 23:45.824
and probably a fatal
brain stem injury.

23:45.825 --> 23:46.895
(Clicks)

23:46.896 --> 23:50.028
Okay, show me yours.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.029
Show you my what?

23:51.030 --> 23:53.702
What do you know
about Patrick deline?

23:53.703 --> 23:55.704
He was an interior
decorator and house flipper.

23:55.705 --> 23:56.805
We talked to his husband.

23:56.806 --> 23:58.006
He was in that part of town

23:58.007 --> 23:59.908
to scope out the neighborhood
at night. The happy couple

23:59.909 --> 24:02.711
was thinking about buying
a loft and renovating it.

24:02.712 --> 24:04.843
Hmm. There's
trace on his sweater.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.074
(Clicking) So really, guys,

24:06.075 --> 24:07.846
anything about me,
Dr. Ethan gross?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.918
Ethan, do you want me
to send you outside again?

24:09.919 --> 24:12.050
No, no, no. I don't
envy Peter one bit.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.782
Did you know that
he's canvassing...

24:13.783 --> 24:15.854
(Whispers) Sperm
banks right now?

24:15.855 --> 24:19.027
There's something
under his nails.

24:19.028 --> 24:20.929
(Clicks)

24:20.930 --> 24:22.832
Let's see what we have here.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.872
Huh. Looks like paint.

24:36.045 --> 24:38.977
Did you say sperm banks?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.849
Okay, so I've been
to all six sperm banks

24:40.850 --> 24:42.050
in the metropolitan area...

24:42.051 --> 24:43.852
Hold on a second. Six?

24:43.853 --> 24:44.983
That's right.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.985
Does he look a
little drained to you?

24:46.986 --> 24:48.987
You know, Pete, you
do look kind of pale.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.119
Yeah, I hope you don't have
a date tonight, 'cause that...

24:51.120 --> 24:52.921
Okay, if you're all done...

24:52.922 --> 24:54.963
(Sam and Kate laugh)

24:54.964 --> 24:57.095
So I found the sperm
bank that Julie went to,

24:57.096 --> 24:58.897
but she left empty-handed.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.899
Then I went to the I.V.F.
Clinic that she was referred to.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.101
They said that when she arrived,
she had a sperm sample on ice,

25:03.102 --> 25:05.003
but they don't
know whose it was.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.777
Martin loeb is not the
father of Julie's baby.

25:08.778 --> 25:10.008
Yeah, we know that.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.080
Oh. Question is, how do you?

25:12.081 --> 25:14.112
Because the real father
is in autopsy room two.

25:14.113 --> 25:17.786
His name is Patrick deline.

25:17.787 --> 25:20.949
The pigment that was found
on both Julie and Patrick

25:20.950 --> 25:23.051
is high-end paint,

25:23.052 --> 25:25.994
which is available only
to interior designers.

25:25.995 --> 25:27.996
What they were both
painting, I have no idea,

25:27.997 --> 25:29.157
but I'm sure it
wasn't a coincidence.

25:29.158 --> 25:31.129
Patrick was gay, so they
weren't having an affair,

25:31.130 --> 25:33.131
but if Martin is sterile,

25:33.132 --> 25:35.804
Julie might have asked
Patrick to be the donor,

25:35.805 --> 25:38.007
hence the paternity test.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.011
You got all that off
a speck of paint?

25:43.012 --> 25:45.944
And Ethan told me that Peter
was hitting up the sperm banks,

25:45.945 --> 25:48.877
so from that, I deduced
what was going on.

25:48.878 --> 25:50.819
How you doing?

25:50.820 --> 25:51.920
Depleted?

25:51.921 --> 25:53.952
Oh... that's funny.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.884
(Sam and Kate chuckle)

25:55.885 --> 25:57.185
So... (Exhales deeply)

25:57.186 --> 26:00.859
Am I back on the case?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.160
Were you ever off it?

26:02.161 --> 26:05.094
Mm, not really.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.773
Patrick and Julie were
best friends from high school.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.846
She came over a few months ago,

26:17.847 --> 26:19.848
told us she had
gone to a sperm bank

26:19.849 --> 26:21.850
but left because she didn't want

26:21.851 --> 26:24.613
the father of her
child to be a stranger.

26:24.614 --> 26:26.785
Her first thought was Patrick.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.586
Made us both cry.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.588
And did Martin loeb
know about this?

26:30.589 --> 26:31.690
No.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.692
Julie wanted to keep it quiet.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.724
Because Martin would've
been angry if he found out?

26:35.725 --> 26:37.325
More like Martin's ex-wife.

26:37.326 --> 26:39.297
Why would she care?

26:39.298 --> 26:41.700
Patrick decorated their
house a few years back.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.702
He brought Julie along one day,

26:43.703 --> 26:46.705
and that's how
Martin and Julie met.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.706
Ah.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.837
Alexandra never forgave Patrick

26:48.838 --> 26:50.608
for making the introduction.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.380
The last thing they wanted was

26:52.381 --> 26:54.713
Alexandra poisoning
Erika and Thomas' feelings

26:54.714 --> 26:56.384
about their new sibling.

26:56.385 --> 26:59.317
Thank you very
much, Mr. Turtell.

26:59.318 --> 27:03.351
And I am very
sorry for your loss.

27:03.352 --> 27:04.853
I'm sorry to ask, and
this may be irrelevant,

27:04.854 --> 27:07.896
but has Patrick done
any painting lately?

27:07.897 --> 27:09.828
He painted all the time.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.901
He has a studio space nearby.

27:12.902 --> 27:15.633
(Curtis) Well, thank
you for coming, Francine.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.766
I really want this job.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.838
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.740
No, you don't understand.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.673
Ireallywant this job.

27:24.674 --> 27:26.644
Ineed...

27:26.645 --> 27:27.716
This job.

27:27.717 --> 27:29.919
(Whispers) I love dead people.

27:31.821 --> 27:34.652
(Mutters)

27:34.653 --> 27:37.656
(Clicks keyboard keys)

27:38.888 --> 27:41.429
(Sighs)

27:41.430 --> 27:42.691
(Curtis) Ethan.

27:42.692 --> 27:44.693
I'm done interviewing
these people.

27:44.694 --> 27:46.865
Well, maybe you're just
interviewing them wrong.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.397
Mnh-mnh. There's only
one way to answer...

27:49.398 --> 27:51.369
(Dial tone drones) "Do you
have a history of traffic accidents?"

27:51.370 --> 27:53.772
And no, it is not "do I get to play with
dead bodies?" (Clicks keypad buttons)

27:53.773 --> 27:55.704
(Phone ringing)
What are you doing?

27:55.705 --> 27:58.376
I am identifying
a murder weapon.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.848
(Rings and clicks)
(Megan) Yes, Ethan.

27:59.849 --> 28:02.781
Uh, just got the results
back from the crime lab.

28:02.782 --> 28:06.384
Patrick deline was beaten
with a type of tire iron

28:06.385 --> 28:08.717
made in Germany for
high-end car brands.

28:08.718 --> 28:11.459
Also, we got the labs back
on the trace from Patrick's shirt.

28:11.460 --> 28:13.922
A residue of calcium and saliva.

28:13.923 --> 28:15.794
Maybe milk or ice cream?

28:15.795 --> 28:17.796
Ice cream? (Mutters)

28:17.797 --> 28:19.798
The good news is, we
have epithelials we can test.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.399
The bad news is,

28:21.400 --> 28:23.471
we have no idea who
to test them against.

28:23.472 --> 28:25.473
Okay, well, start
by ruling out Patrick

28:25.474 --> 28:27.475
as the source
of the epithelials.

28:27.476 --> 28:29.878
And, Curtis, call Sam and
bud, tell them about the tire iron.

28:29.879 --> 28:32.480
I bet you Alexandra
has a German car.

28:32.481 --> 28:34.943

31:34.593 --> 31:35.994
As it turns out,

31:35.995 --> 31:37.966
Patrick redecorated
the loebs' house

31:37.967 --> 31:39.097
several years ago.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.929
That's how Martin and Julie met.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.900
And loeb's ex-wife
blamed Patrick,

31:42.901 --> 31:45.133
enough for Julie to
keep it secret that Patrick

31:45.134 --> 31:47.905
was the biological
father of her child.

There was some foreign
matter mixed in with the blood

31:56.615 --> 31:57.915
around Julie's wound.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.047
It turns out, the
way she landed,

31:59.048 --> 32:01.689
some of her stomach contents
migrated up her esophagus.

32:01.690 --> 32:03.992
But there's also this.

32:03.993 --> 32:06.694
It's the pollen from a
rare kind of oak tree.

32:06.695 --> 32:08.626
So what, did she ingest it?

32:08.627 --> 32:10.959
'Cause it's not in bloom now,
so how did it get in the wound?

32:10.960 --> 32:14.202
It was deposited
there by the bullet.

32:14.203 --> 32:16.204
It grazed a leaf on its way.

32:16.205 --> 32:19.068
Well, now we know where
our shooter was standing.

32:44.633 --> 32:45.963

32:45.964 --> 32:47.965
So the southern red oak,

32:47.966 --> 32:49.637
orquercus falcata,

32:49.638 --> 32:52.640
is a medium-sized deciduous tree

32:52.641 --> 32:54.042
with a round-topped head

32:54.043 --> 32:56.044
and leaves, uh, the
size of your hand,

32:56.045 --> 32:57.745
with three to five
pointed lobes.

32:57.746 --> 32:59.747
Here, look. Here's a picture.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.686
This is crazy.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.018
No, this is great.

We're medicolegal

33:11.760 --> 33:13.161
No, we're not. We
are sitting ducks.

33:13.162 --> 33:15.993
Okay, so the tree is rare
in these parts 'cause it's

33:15.994 --> 33:17.995
at the northern limit
of its growing range.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.768
Much like the American Holly
or sweetbay magnolia, this...

33:20.769 --> 33:22.770
Enough with the tree
lesson. We're here.

33:22.771 --> 33:26.104
Let's go find that
southern red oak.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.106
All right, I've got
the bank statements.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.707
You've got Martin
loeb's statements.

look at the crime scene

33:53.262 --> 33:57.705

judgments and preconditions.

33:57.706 --> 33:59.167
(Exhales)

33:59.168 --> 34:00.768
This is the tree, fool.

34:00.769 --> 34:01.809
It works.

34:01.810 --> 34:05.173
Which means, if the
bullet hit her here,

34:05.174 --> 34:06.774
then it came from right there.

34:06.775 --> 34:09.046
And there is no way
I'm going in there.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.250

over this place. Mnh-mnh.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.182

the summer home.

retirement, personal accounts,

35:35.804 --> 35:37.365
they all match up.

35:37.366 --> 35:40.809

35:42.811 --> 35:44.812
That's a hell of a
difference. Mm-hmm.

35:44.813 --> 35:48.276
Guess who had trading
authority on the account?

35:48.277 --> 35:50.218
(Chuckles) (Megan) Is that it?

35:50.219 --> 35:53.351
Yeah, the results
just came back in.

36:00.229 --> 36:01.289
You recognize that?

36:01.290 --> 36:03.191
(Sniffs) I know. It
smells like hairspray.

36:03.192 --> 36:05.233
It was Erika, loeb's daughter...

36:05.234 --> 36:06.934
Except for one thing, there's
a compound in the mixture

36:06.935 --> 36:08.336
that isn't hairspray.

36:08.337 --> 36:10.167
Minoxidil?

36:10.168 --> 36:12.300
Yeah. Some men
use... not me... Use it to...

36:12.301 --> 36:14.171
Stimulate hair growth. Right.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.374
I'll be damned.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.307
Calcium was found in
the trace on Patrick, right?

36:19.308 --> 36:21.379
Yes. Curtis thought
it was ice cream.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.180
It wasn't ice cream or milk.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.183
Calcium is one of the primary
ingredients in antacid tablets.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.255
Okay.

36:27.256 --> 36:29.288
And a symptom of acid reflux is?

36:41.930 --> 36:43.431
Go ahead and have
a seat over there.

36:43.432 --> 36:45.373
Mr. Loeb, I...

36:45.374 --> 36:47.935
(Sam) Mr. Wright, thank you for
coming in. Owe you an apology.

36:47.936 --> 36:49.377
(Morris) As you
told us before...

36:49.378 --> 36:51.309
What were we having?

36:51.310 --> 36:52.310
Excuse me?

36:52.311 --> 36:53.981
The baby.

36:53.982 --> 36:55.883
Wanted to know how it
would affect Martin's finances.

36:55.884 --> 36:57.915
A girl.

36:57.916 --> 36:58.986
Yes.

36:58.987 --> 37:01.218
The minute you realized

37:01.219 --> 37:02.420
that Julie's request

37:02.421 --> 37:04.422
would force an audit
of Martin's assets,

37:04.423 --> 37:06.954
you knew you were
in trouble because...

37:06.955 --> 37:08.456
You've been stealing
from him for years.

37:08.457 --> 37:10.227
(Coughs)

37:10.228 --> 37:11.359
You don't know what
you're talking about.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.960
We've got the bank
statements, Alan.

37:12.961 --> 37:14.362
Not the fake ones you've
been sending Martin,

37:14.363 --> 37:15.463
the real ones.

37:15.464 --> 37:17.265
So you killed Julie

37:17.266 --> 37:18.466
to cover your tracks,

37:18.467 --> 37:21.409
but the only unanswered
question is Patrick.

37:21.410 --> 37:23.010
(Coughs)

37:23.011 --> 37:24.912
Acid reflux, right? (Grunts)

37:24.913 --> 37:26.914
Here you go. My
wife has it, too.

37:26.915 --> 37:29.317
See, that's how we
knew you met with Patrick.

37:29.318 --> 37:30.448
You must have
really gotten winded

37:30.449 --> 37:33.020
when you beat him to death,
because you coughed so hard,

37:33.021 --> 37:34.452
you expelled saliva.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.454
(Sam) We pulled
blood and hair traces

37:36.455 --> 37:38.386
from the tire iron in your car.

37:38.387 --> 37:40.388
We've got you nailed on Patrick.

37:40.389 --> 37:42.390
And we have traces of
your hair loss treatment

37:42.391 --> 37:44.932
in the woods, exactly
where the shot was taken

37:44.933 --> 37:46.334
that killed Julie.

37:46.335 --> 37:49.337
No lawyer in the
world's gonna save you,

37:49.338 --> 37:50.998
not with the evidence
that we have.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.400
But tell the truth right now,

37:52.401 --> 37:56.274
and it'll go far with the d.A.

38:00.949 --> 38:03.351
Can I talk to Martin?

38:03.352 --> 38:06.414
I don't think he
wants to talk to you.

38:06.415 --> 38:09.958
I didn't set out
to steal from him.

38:11.420 --> 38:14.392
I just needed a loan in a
hurry for a business deal.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.494
The deal blew up, I
couldn't repay the money,

38:16.495 --> 38:18.966
so I cooked the
books to cover it up.

38:18.967 --> 38:21.469
Martin never questioned it.

38:21.470 --> 38:24.432
And then it just became easy.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.474
So Julie got suspicious?

38:26.475 --> 38:28.476
She thought I was
dragging my feet on the audit.

38:28.477 --> 38:31.509
She was gonna recommend Martin
find another business manager.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.981
I couldn't let that happen.

38:33.982 --> 38:35.082
And Patrick?

38:35.083 --> 38:38.315
The day of the shooting,
he came to my office.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.348
Julie had told him
that she didn't trust me,

38:40.349 --> 38:43.521
and he demanded to
know what happened.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.553
He was the father
of Julie's child.

38:45.554 --> 38:48.055
He wasn't gonna let it go.

38:48.056 --> 38:50.498
(Sam) And so you
followed him downtown?

38:50.499 --> 38:53.431
I was just so in over my head.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.504
I didn't know what to do.

38:59.438 --> 39:03.110
Please... Tell Martin I'm sorry.

39:03.111 --> 39:04.512
I'm...

39:04.513 --> 39:07.576
I'm so very, very sorry.

39:27.536 --> 39:29.497
Martin.

39:29.498 --> 39:31.469
The money I could forgive,

39:31.470 --> 39:33.370
but not Julie,

39:33.371 --> 39:35.573
not our child.

39:35.574 --> 39:36.574
(Gasps) No!

39:36.575 --> 39:38.375
(Grunts)

39:38.376 --> 39:40.108
Call an ambulance!

39:47.586 --> 39:50.387
Alan? Alan?

39:50.388 --> 39:52.059
Is he gonna make it?

39:52.060 --> 39:54.562
(Martin) Congratulations,
detectives.

39:54.563 --> 39:57.466
You finally have
something to arrest me for.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.472

40:04.473 --> 40:05.533

40:05.534 --> 40:07.075
(Door opens)

40:08.477 --> 40:10.578
Quite the drama you had today.

40:10.579 --> 40:12.510
Yeah. Where were you?

40:12.511 --> 40:14.482
Investigating.

40:14.483 --> 40:16.083
There is a video on here

40:16.084 --> 40:18.185
that I think you
should take a look at.

40:18.186 --> 40:20.417
You want to watch it with me?

40:20.418 --> 40:23.090
Sorry, but I have a date.

40:23.091 --> 40:27.094
Same girl or a new one?

40:27.095 --> 40:29.597
(Chuckles) Good night, Megan.

40:29.598 --> 40:31.630
Peter...

40:33.532 --> 40:36.134
You like working
with me, don't you?

40:37.466 --> 40:40.469
I wouldn't have brought
you that if I didn't.

40:43.672 --> 40:47.115

are, painting the crib.

41:00.589 --> 41:02.660
You are on.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.532
Hello, baby.

41:04.533 --> 41:06.193
I'm your mommy.

41:06.194 --> 41:09.236
And you're gonna grow up with
a wonderful daddy named Martin.

41:09.237 --> 41:11.238
But there's somebody
else who loves you

41:11.239 --> 41:13.140
just as much as we do.

41:13.141 --> 41:15.142
He's your biological father.

41:15.143 --> 41:17.144
Patrick.

41:17.145 --> 41:18.245
Okay.

41:18.246 --> 41:20.708
Hello... baby.

41:20.709 --> 41:25.613
Uh... I may never be
the father who raises you,

41:25.614 --> 41:28.686
but I'll always be the
father who loves you,

41:28.687 --> 41:30.558
no matter what.

41:30.559 --> 41:32.259
But know...

41:32.260 --> 41:33.691
That I love you,

41:33.692 --> 41:36.664
just as much as Martin does.

41:36.665 --> 41:40.598
Being a parent means
wanting the best for your child,

41:40.599 --> 41:42.630
no matter who provides it.
