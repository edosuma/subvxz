00:02.670 --> 00:03.859
Hey, why are you touching

00:03.860 --> 00:05.047
my utensils?

00:05.089 --> 00:06.716
- They only like me
- to touch them!

00:08.760 --> 00:09.802
Their rules, not mine!

00:11.763 --> 00:12.907
- Bertram, we're
- making you breakfast

00:12.931 --> 00:14.557
- Because it's your
- birthday weekend.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.367
- Oh, thanks, - but I already have
- A reservation

00:16.392 --> 00:17.685
At Pancake Palace.

00:17.727 --> 00:18.853
ALL: Yay!

00:18.895 --> 00:19.938
It's for one.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.814
ALL (DISAPPOINTED): Aw.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.776
On that festive note...

00:24.817 --> 00:26.795
- What are you all giving
- Bertram for his birthday?

00:26.819 --> 00:28.028
A gently used lip balm.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.363
Free hug.

00:29.364 --> 00:30.656
My profound admiration.

00:31.908 --> 00:33.117
This salt shaker.

00:34.953 --> 00:36.392
Guys! Put in

00:36.393 --> 00:37.830
a little effort.

00:37.872 --> 00:38.936
I got Bertram the most

00:38.937 --> 00:39.999
thoughtful gift ever.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.417
Foot deodorant?

00:43.168 --> 00:45.129
- No, but you can get him
- that for my birthday.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.175
Look, Bertram hasn't

00:48.176 --> 00:49.634
seen his mother in years.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.698
So I asked your parents

00:50.699 --> 00:51.719
to fly Mrs. Winkle in

00:51.761 --> 00:53.638
- for his party as
- a surprise!

00:53.679 --> 00:55.161
Ooh, I cannot wait to meet

00:55.162 --> 00:56.641
Bertram's mother.

Sorry, Jessie.

We're doing

an egg drop competition

02:20.391 --> 02:21.350

Hey, Luke, maybe let Ravi

take the lead on this.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.741
Science is his thing.

02:36.782 --> 02:37.888
After all, he wouldn't

02:37.889 --> 02:38.993
tell you how to dance

- or play sports,
- or be cool.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.788
Thank you, Jessie.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.498
Wait a moment...

02:45.875 --> 02:46.876
Hey, I could be

02:46.877 --> 02:47.877
good at science.

02:47.919 --> 02:49.420
- I just choose
- to be popular.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.567
- I'm beginning to feel
- your sadness.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.866
Bertram! We have

02:56.867 --> 02:58.721
a great birthday surprise

02:55.009 --> 02:58.721
for you.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.035
You're moving back to Texas

03:10.005 --> 03:11.275
doing here?

Wondering why

03:12.444 --> 03:13.569
you're still not married.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.406
And we're off.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.366
- Hi, Mrs. Winkle,
- I'm Jessie.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.953
Hi. So nice to meet you!

03:21.994 --> 03:23.809
You have this

03:23.810 --> 03:25.623
little angel to thank

03:21.994 --> 03:25.623
for me being here.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.825
- (STRAINED)
- Thanks, Jessie.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.606
How is my little

03:29.607 --> 03:30.669
Ber-tootchka?

- Ber-tootchka?

Oh, look at these

03:41.828 --> 03:43.474
sweet children.

03:43.515 --> 03:44.934
You're like the Von Trapps,

03:44.935 --> 03:46.351
without the lederhosen.

03:47.686 --> 03:48.896
Do they sing?

03:48.938 --> 03:50.795
No, but they can whine

03:50.796 --> 03:52.650
in four-part harmony.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.631
Hello, Mrs. Bertram's mommy.

03:54.632 --> 03:56.570
I am Ravi,

03:52.691 --> 03:56.570
and these are my siblings

03:56.612 --> 03:58.135
Emma, Luke and Zuri.

03:58.136 --> 03:59.657
Welcome to our home.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.534
Oh, aren't you the sweetest

04:01.535 --> 04:03.368
little things?

04:03.410 --> 04:04.536
You're nice.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.705
Are you sure

04:05.706 --> 04:06.831
you gave birth to that?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.500
You betcha.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.856
It was the second

04:10.857 --> 04:12.170
greatest day of my life.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.963
It wasn't the first?

04:14.005 --> 04:15.569
I'm sorry, sweetie,

04:15.570 --> 04:17.132
but numero uno

04:14.005 --> 04:17.132
will always be

04:17.175 --> 04:19.238
the night that I got

04:19.240 --> 04:21.303
a standing ovation

04:17.175 --> 04:21.303
opening for Frank.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.346
You opened

04:22.347 --> 04:23.347
for Frank Sinatra?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.723
No, Frank Stallone.

04:26.142 --> 04:27.623
So my birth ranks behind

04:27.624 --> 04:29.103
Rocky's brother?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.063
Aw.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.752
To be fair, you were

04:32.753 --> 04:34.399
a 12-pound breech.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.569
Well, it was no picnic

04:37.570 --> 04:38.737
on my end either.

04:40.156 --> 04:41.741
Speaking of picnics,

04:41.742 --> 04:43.325
you could skip a few.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.245
Give the ants a chance.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.331
Who wants candy?

04:49.373 --> 04:50.875
- Oh! Me! Me! Me!
- Oh, I do!

04:50.916 --> 04:52.231
No!

04:52.232 --> 04:53.544
Ow!

04:53.585 --> 04:55.484
So, Mrs. Winkle, how long

04:55.485 --> 04:57.381
has it been since you've

04:53.585 --> 04:57.381
seen Ber-tootchka?

04:57.422 --> 04:58.674
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

04:59.258 --> 05:00.551
Too long.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.553
I would come more often,

05:02.554 --> 05:04.513
but it's so far...

05:06.182 --> 05:08.226
The resemblance is uncanny.

05:11.062 --> 05:12.230
Do not worry, my spring

05:12.231 --> 05:13.397
cushioned egg container

05:13.438 --> 05:15.191
will get us a top grade.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.484
Grade?

05:17.526 --> 05:18.966
I thought

05:18.967 --> 05:20.404
this was for money!

05:20.445 --> 05:22.698
If knowledge is money,

05:22.699 --> 05:24.950
then yes, we shall be rich.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.703
You make me sick.

05:31.916 --> 05:32.917
- (THUDDING)
- (WHOOSHING)

05:33.500 --> 05:34.501
(GASPS)

05:35.878 --> 05:36.879
(CRACKING)

05:40.091 --> 05:41.092
(LAUGHS)

05:42.843 --> 05:44.511
Suddenly, I feel better.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.704
Okay, I need

05:48.705 --> 05:49.892
to get a pinata

05:47.514 --> 05:49.892
for Bertram's party.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.810
- Do you think
- he'd like to whack a burro?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.646
Because I checked,

05:53.647 --> 05:55.439
and they don't have anything

05:51.852 --> 05:55.439
that looks like Luke.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.545
You know they

05:56.546 --> 05:57.608
sell candy in stores.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.548
You don't have to

05:59.549 --> 06:01.445
beat it out of an animal.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.093
I think Bertram would rather

06:03.094 --> 06:04.698
smack the Scooter Bars

06:01.486 --> 06:04.698
out of his mom.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.743
- He obviously
- can't stand her!

06:07.785 --> 06:09.453
- Maybe he was just moody
- this morning.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.247
He's way beyond moody.

06:11.289 --> 06:12.498
At lunch, he

06:12.499 --> 06:13.707
gave our mini-pizzas

06:11.289 --> 06:13.707
pepperoni frowns!

06:15.500 --> 06:16.940
It was like eating cheesy,

06:16.941 --> 06:18.378
thin crusted rage.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.236
Okay, maybe things are

06:21.237 --> 06:22.382
a little tense,

06:22.424 --> 06:23.509
but Bertram's mother

06:23.510 --> 06:24.593
is my present to him,

06:24.635 --> 06:26.116
and I'm going to

06:26.117 --> 06:27.596
make him like it

06:24.635 --> 06:27.596
if it's the last thing I do!

06:27.638 --> 06:28.973
That's what you said about

06:28.974 --> 06:30.308
those three-fingered gloves

06:27.638 --> 06:30.308
you knitted us.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.518
- BTW, we're not
- cartoon characters.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.605
I ran out of wool!

06:36.647 --> 06:38.378
Look, the point is,

06:38.379 --> 06:40.109
I'm sure I can

06:36.647 --> 06:40.109
smooth things over.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.465
Wanda seems like

06:41.466 --> 06:42.778
a perfectly lovely lady.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.009
I just had a brainstorm

06:44.010 --> 06:45.197
on the toilet!

06:47.074 --> 06:48.681
I hope she didn't use

06:48.682 --> 06:50.286
my bathroom.

06:50.328 --> 06:52.330
I think what

06:52.331 --> 06:54.332
Bertie's party needs

06:50.328 --> 06:54.332
is a big dance number!

06:54.373 --> 06:56.458
Like a real show stopper!

06:56.500 --> 06:57.459
That's a great idea!

06:57.501 --> 06:58.877
- You know,
- I don't want to brag,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.629
- But I was on drill team
- in high school.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.131
Oh, well,

07:02.132 --> 07:03.590
I do want to brag.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.175
I was a Rockette

07:05.176 --> 07:06.718
in New York City.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.095
That's a drill team

07:08.096 --> 07:09.429
for dancers who are good.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.224
I was good.

07:14.185 --> 07:15.604
Actually, a dance number

07:15.605 --> 07:17.021
might cheer Bertram up.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.314
Yeah, have you noticed

07:18.315 --> 07:19.564
he seems a little grumpy?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.796
When he was a kid

07:20.797 --> 07:21.984
and he was crabby

07:22.026 --> 07:23.757
it meant he had

07:23.758 --> 07:25.487
an extra painful pimple

07:22.026 --> 07:25.487
on his tushy.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.534
I'm not checking for that.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.104
Bertram, do you have

07:38.105 --> 07:39.459
a big pimple on your tushy?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.753
What? No!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.714
- So it must be a problem
- with his mom.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.133
But what could it be?

07:46.175 --> 07:47.906
She's warm, and funny,

07:47.907 --> 07:49.636
and upbeat...

07:49.678 --> 07:51.118
Frankly,

07:51.119 --> 07:52.556
it's hard to believe

07:49.678 --> 07:52.556
you share the same DNA.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.475
Oh, we do.

07:54.476 --> 07:56.352
I paid for the test myself

07:52.597 --> 07:56.352
when I was 12.

07:56.394 --> 07:57.708
Did you two not notice

07:57.709 --> 07:59.021
her insulting me?

07:59.063 --> 08:00.335
Plus, she always needs

08:00.336 --> 08:01.606
to be the center of attention.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.609
What's wrong with that?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.382
Everything.

08:06.383 --> 08:08.113
My whole life,

08:04.651 --> 08:08.113
it's always been about her.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.574
It can't be that bad.

08:09.575 --> 08:10.991
Not that bad?

08:11.033 --> 08:12.993
- At my elementary
- school graduation,

08:13.035 --> 08:14.558
She gave

08:14.559 --> 08:16.080
the valedictorian speech

08:13.035 --> 08:16.080
on my behalf.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.290
Aw, were you too nervous?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.209
- No, she just beat me
- to the podium!

08:21.210 --> 08:23.003
Okay...

08:23.045 --> 08:24.359
But you're both here now,

08:24.360 --> 08:25.672
thanks to my lovely

08:23.045 --> 08:25.672
birthday gesture,

08:25.714 --> 08:26.715
you're welcome,

08:28.133 --> 08:29.610
- so why don't
- you just talk to her?

08:29.634 --> 08:30.802
I've been trying ever since

08:30.803 --> 08:31.970
I learned to talk,

08:32.011 --> 08:33.638
but she never listens!

08:33.679 --> 08:34.932
You try being

08:34.933 --> 08:36.183
Wanda Winkle's son!

08:36.225 --> 08:37.351
You know what? I will.

08:37.352 --> 08:38.477
Let's role-play.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.953
- I'll be you,
- and you be your mom.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.688
- And I'll be Emma.
- Good choice.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.194
Okay. Here we go.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.030
- (AS BERTRAM)
- Mom, I love you,

08:50.072 --> 08:51.178
But, sometimes I think

08:51.179 --> 08:52.283
you can be a bit critical.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.118
- (AS WANDA)
- I am not, you loser!

08:54.159 --> 08:55.766
I gave up a fabulous career

08:55.767 --> 08:57.371
on the stage for you.

08:57.413 --> 08:58.456
But I still have

08:58.457 --> 08:59.498
dancers' legs.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.354
(CHUCKLES) Remember

09:01.355 --> 09:03.168
when I used to stand

08:59.539 --> 09:03.168
outside in your kiddie pool

09:03.210 --> 09:05.045
and make you shave them?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.006
Jessie, I'm scared.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.718
Run. Save yourself.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.929
And since you were born,

09:13.930 --> 09:16.098
I've had to go to the bathroom

09:11.760 --> 09:16.098
every 10 minutes!

09:16.140 --> 09:17.141
Time's up!

09:18.600 --> 09:19.643
What are you guys

09:19.644 --> 09:20.685
talking about?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.313
Actually, you.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.939
My favorite topic.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.651
- Bertram has something
- he'd like to say to you.

09:29.528 --> 09:33.657
Okay, Mom... The truth is...

09:33.698 --> 09:35.764
When I'm around you,

09:35.765 --> 09:37.828
sometimes it's

09:33.698 --> 09:37.828
a little frustrating

09:37.869 --> 09:39.579
- because...
- I know.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.644
Because you wanted to

09:40.645 --> 09:41.665
be a dancer, like me,

09:41.706 --> 09:43.375
but you just didn't

09:43.376 --> 09:45.043
have the gams for it.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.108
You have chicken legs

09:46.109 --> 09:47.129
like your father.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.631
See?

09:50.674 --> 09:52.426
I, on the other hand,

09:52.427 --> 09:54.178
have calves like rocks.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.720
Come over here, feel.

09:55.762 --> 09:56.762
Come on.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.059
Okay, I promise

10:00.060 --> 10:01.560
this one will work.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.437
Three... Two...

10:07.024 --> 10:08.797
Welcome to Fail City.

10:08.798 --> 10:10.569
Population Ravi.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.532
Why will nothing work?

10:14.573 --> 10:15.699
(SOBBING LOUDLY)

10:18.202 --> 10:19.203
Luke! Did you chase Ravi

10:19.204 --> 10:20.204
up onto the island again?

10:20.245 --> 10:21.886
- You know he can't
- get down by himself.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.920
I didn't do anything!

10:28.962 --> 10:30.798
Ravi's just frustrated

10:30.799 --> 10:32.632
because his stupid scientific

10:28.962 --> 10:32.632
ideas aren't working.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.967
Well, maybe you should let

10:33.968 --> 10:35.260
Luke take the lead

10:32.674 --> 10:35.260
on this project.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.054
- You need an outside
- of the box thinker.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.410
And Luke is so outside,

10:38.411 --> 10:39.723
he doesn't know

10:37.095 --> 10:39.723
where the box is.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.393
Well, thank you.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.688
But science is my thing.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.107
Well, socks with sandals

10:48.108 --> 10:49.483
can still be your thing.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.404
I do make it work.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.367
Kick, ball change.

10:58.368 --> 10:59.993
Kick, ball change.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.993
Eye-high kick!

11:00.035 --> 11:01.892
Ow!

11:01.893 --> 11:03.747
Did you say eye high

11:00.035 --> 11:03.747
or thigh-high?

11:03.788 --> 11:05.707
That's what happens

11:05.708 --> 11:07.626
when you don't space

11:03.788 --> 11:07.626
yourself properly.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.295
Jessie, you really

11:09.296 --> 11:10.921
should've been here

11:07.667 --> 11:10.921
when we started rehearsing.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.465
Look, I'm sorry

11:13.466 --> 11:14.466
I showed up late,

11:14.508 --> 11:16.027
- but I was at
- the party supply store,

11:16.051 --> 11:17.365
Returning everything

11:17.366 --> 11:18.678
I bought because

11:16.051 --> 11:18.678
someone didn't like it.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.201
Oh. Who was that?

11:20.202 --> 11:21.681
Because I thought

11:18.720 --> 11:21.681
they were lousy, too.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.102
I was talking about y...

11:25.143 --> 11:26.416
Never mind,

11:26.417 --> 11:27.687
apology accepted.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.565
- Now, let's take it
- from the top!

11:29.607 --> 11:33.110
This time, with some pizazz!

11:33.151 --> 11:34.819
- (GRUNTS)
- (SCREAMING)

11:36.988 --> 11:38.011
You see, there's that

11:38.012 --> 11:39.032
poor spacing again.

11:40.451 --> 11:41.848
Did anyone on your

11:41.849 --> 11:43.245
drill team survive?

11:44.622 --> 11:46.498
Girls, be nice.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.125
Jessie can't help it if

11:48.126 --> 11:49.709
she has the grace

11:46.540 --> 11:49.709
of a manatee with vertigo.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.131
Thank you?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.071
You know, Jessie,

11:56.072 --> 11:57.968
it's not fair of us to ask

11:54.172 --> 11:57.968
you to do the dance

11:58.009 --> 11:59.637
and set up all

11:59.638 --> 12:01.263
the decorations,

11:58.009 --> 12:01.263
so...

12:01.305 --> 12:02.932
So... You want me out

12:02.933 --> 12:04.558
of the dance number?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.726
If you insist.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.478
Oh! Oh, right, 'cause you

12:08.479 --> 12:10.188
wouldn't want too many people

12:06.768 --> 12:10.188
in a Rockettes routine!

12:10.230 --> 12:11.315
All the great kick lines

12:11.316 --> 12:12.399
were three girls or less.

12:13.651 --> 12:14.798
I knew you'd come around.

12:14.799 --> 12:15.944
(CHUCKLES)

12:15.986 --> 12:17.755
- Now, could you
- go around over there, please,

12:17.779 --> 12:19.406
- Because you're
- in my kick-zone!

12:19.448 --> 12:21.492
(JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING)

12:21.533 --> 12:23.515
And, five, six,

12:23.516 --> 12:25.496
seven, eight!

12:25.537 --> 12:27.539
Fine, I'll go. But I want

12:27.540 --> 12:29.541
you to know, you've

12:25.537 --> 12:29.541
really hurt me in here.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.423
And now... Up here.

Advertise your product or brand here

12:45.098 --> 12:46.996
Bertram, why are you

12:46.997 --> 12:48.893
dressed like a waiter

12:45.098 --> 12:48.893
at El Taco Grande?

12:51.396 --> 12:52.731
I'm going to Cabo!

12:52.814 --> 12:54.692
- Tell my mom I'll send her
- a chimichanga.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.801
Bertram, I see Wanda

12:59.802 --> 13:01.740
isn't the easiest person

12:57.861 --> 13:01.740
to be around,

13:01.781 --> 13:03.325
but she's still your mom,

13:03.326 --> 13:04.868
and you can't run away

13:01.781 --> 13:04.868
from your problems.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.411
Maybe not in these sandals,

13:06.412 --> 13:07.912
but I got a change of shoes

13:04.909 --> 13:07.912
in my bag.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.210
Look, I know what

13:12.211 --> 13:13.711
it's like to have problems

13:10.708 --> 13:13.711
with a parent.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.587
My dad was really tough.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.048
In fact, we didn't really

13:17.049 --> 13:18.465
bond until I overcame

13:15.629 --> 13:18.465
that last hurdle.

13:18.507 --> 13:19.717
And what was that?

13:19.758 --> 13:20.759
The last hurdle.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.760
Of the obstacle course.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.638
When I finally cleared it,

13:24.639 --> 13:25.805
he stopped wishing

13:23.470 --> 13:25.805
I was a boy.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.227
I'm glad to hear it.

13:29.228 --> 13:30.894
Meanwhile, I'm in

13:27.558 --> 13:30.894
boarding group A, so, uh...

13:33.397 --> 13:34.649
Bertram,

13:34.650 --> 13:35.899
I know it's my fault

13:33.397 --> 13:35.899
that your mom is here,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.752
- but you might as well
- take advantage of it.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.070
You know, you're right.

13:39.071 --> 13:40.362
It is your fault.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.387
Okay,

13:44.388 --> 13:46.535
we've assigned blame,

13:42.239 --> 13:46.535
let's move on.

13:46.577 --> 13:47.870
My point is, your mom

13:47.871 --> 13:49.162
is not going to be

13:46.577 --> 13:49.162
around forever,

13:49.204 --> 13:51.081
- so you should tell her
- how you feel!

13:51.122 --> 13:52.333
And who's going to tape

13:52.334 --> 13:53.542
her mouth shut

13:51.122 --> 13:53.542
so I can do that?

13:55.168 --> 13:56.587
I'm not going to let you go.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.147
- Oh, yeah?
- How are you gonna stop me?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.172
Is that your passport?

14:00.924 --> 14:02.697
Wha... No! No! Oh!

14:02.698 --> 14:04.469
(SOBBING)

14:07.264 --> 14:08.664
- (MUFFLED)
- You'll thank me later.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.647
I am ashamed I failed

14:14.648 --> 14:16.565
at accomplishing

14:12.728 --> 14:16.565
this scientific task.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.421
Now I know how you feel

14:18.422 --> 14:20.235
when you walk

14:16.607 --> 14:20.235
out of every audition.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.030
Well, I was going to try

14:24.031 --> 14:25.198
and make you feel better,

14:25.240 --> 14:27.040
- but now I'm going to go
- buy a bag of nuts.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.788
I'm so sorry, Jessie.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.312
I am just upset because

14:33.313 --> 14:35.793
Luke has completely cut me

14:30.829 --> 14:35.793
out of our project.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.482
Good luck, Luke!

14:37.483 --> 14:39.129
Break an egg!

14:35.834 --> 14:39.129
(CHUCKLES)

14:39.170 --> 14:40.652
Uh, Jessie, the entire point

14:40.653 --> 14:42.132
of the project is not to

14:39.170 --> 14:42.132
break...

14:42.173 --> 14:43.174
It was a joke!

14:44.635 --> 14:46.303
- Not if you
- have to explain it.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.602
Is it a viscous disaster?

14:57.648 --> 14:59.775
(APPLAUSE)

14:59.817 --> 15:00.900
Ba-boosh!

15:02.653 --> 15:04.029
It actually worked!

15:04.030 --> 15:05.405
Luke succeeded in science.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.408
It is snowing in Hades.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.246
I told you

15:12.247 --> 15:13.955
I had mad scientific skills!

15:13.997 --> 15:15.874
I got us an A!

15:16.792 --> 15:19.043
Congratulations, brother.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.297
When you win the Nobel Prize,

15:21.298 --> 15:23.507
will you at least

15:19.085 --> 15:23.507
invite me to the after-party?

15:23.548 --> 15:25.572
Only if I get a plus one,

15:25.573 --> 15:27.594
and you're

15:23.548 --> 15:27.594
the last person on Earth.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.596
- Thank you, brother!
- (GRUNTS)

15:33.016 --> 15:34.559
- Okay, Luke,
- I'm no Einstein,

15:34.601 --> 15:36.103
But I'm pretty sure

15:36.104 --> 15:37.604
this is a hard-boiled egg.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.919
Hey, the project was

15:38.920 --> 15:40.190
to drop an egg

15:37.646 --> 15:40.190
without breaking it.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.399
And that's what I did.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.276
So you cheated?

15:43.318 --> 15:44.486
No, I thought

15:44.487 --> 15:45.654
outside the box.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.135
Jessie, do you know

15:48.136 --> 15:49.282
what this means?

15:49.324 --> 15:50.347
Yes. Luke is

15:50.348 --> 15:51.368
going to confess.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.016
Which, I'm afraid,

This means I am

still better than Luke

Jessie, why did you hire

16:27.363 --> 16:28.446
so many waiters?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.782
Oh, I didn't.

16:29.783 --> 16:31.074
They're Bertram's

16:31.115 --> 16:32.367
I wish they would eat the food

16:32.368 --> 16:33.618
instead of just offering it

16:31.115 --> 16:33.618
to each other.

Now, if my mother

16:38.813 --> 16:39.833
doesn't show up

16:37.789 --> 16:39.833
to embarrass me,

16:39.875 --> 16:41.585
it'll be perfect.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.254
Bertram, give her a chance.

16:43.255 --> 16:44.880
Maybe she'll surprise you.

Wanda said we weren't good

17:14.243 --> 17:16.286
enough, so she kicked us
