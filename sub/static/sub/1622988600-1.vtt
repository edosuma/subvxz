WEBVTT

01:19.856 --> 01:22.491
All right,
all right, all right.

01:43.578 --> 01:45.815
"Boyfriend, girlfriend."

01:45.848 --> 01:48.751
Man, I know that's
so weird to hear.

01:48.785 --> 01:50.619
but I guess I can tell you.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.821
Just tell me.

01:52.989 --> 01:55.691
Why didn't you tell me
sophomore year?

01:55.725 --> 01:57.592
I don't know. I was scared.

01:57.626 --> 01:59.628
Thought you weren't
gonna talk to me again.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.496
Aww.

02:01.530 --> 02:02.464
That's so cute.

02:06.035 --> 02:08.537
Yeah, well, I guess you're
not the only one with a secret.

02:10.006 --> 02:12.008
I've kind of
been into you, too.

02:12.041 --> 02:13.441
What?

02:13.475 --> 02:14.543
Uh-huh.

02:14.576 --> 02:16.378
And you weren't gonna tell me?

02:16.411 --> 02:18.480
I don't know.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.415
Guess I was scared.

02:20.448 --> 02:23.085
Thought you'd never
talk to me again.

02:47.009 --> 02:49.377
Um, excuse me. Do you mind?

02:51.848 --> 02:54.382
We don't have
any drinks for you guys,

02:54.416 --> 02:56.118
so can you, like,
leave us alone?

02:58.688 --> 03:00.890
Will you let us in?

03:00.923 --> 03:02.825
I'm sorry. What?

03:05.928 --> 03:08.931
Will you let us in?

03:08.965 --> 03:11.067
You know you guys are,
like, five months premature

03:11.100 --> 03:12.802
with the whole
Halloween costumes, right?

03:13.803 --> 03:16.504
Ugh. What is that smell?

03:16.538 --> 03:17.707
I don't know.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.641
Let's get out of here.

03:19.674 --> 03:21.811
Well, ladies and gents,
it's been a pleasure,

03:21.844 --> 03:23.746
but we're gonna skirt.

03:30.652 --> 03:32.621
Okay, I don't know
what kind of weird stuff

03:32.654 --> 03:36.158
you guys are pulling here,
but we're just gonna go, okay?

03:41.097 --> 03:42.631
Oh, my God.

03:43.531 --> 03:44.566
Okay, seriously, guys,

03:44.599 --> 03:45.835
get the hell out of our way!

03:45.868 --> 03:47.636
Will you let us in?

03:47.669 --> 03:49.972
Is that all you guys want?

03:50.006 --> 03:51.874
You want us to let you in?

03:51.908 --> 03:53.776
'Cause I don't know
what the hell that means,

03:53.809 --> 03:55.945
but okay, sure.
We'll play along.

04:00.249 --> 04:01.483
Agh! My arm! Ahh!

04:01.516 --> 04:03.152
Oh, my God! Let him go!

04:20.102 --> 04:21.170
Damn it.

04:31.579 --> 04:33.749
- Dad?
- Honey, you okay?

04:33.783 --> 04:36.651
Dad, oh, my God.
There's crazy people after me,

04:36.686 --> 04:38.220
and I'm in the middle
of the woods,

04:38.254 --> 04:39.989
- and I don't...
- Carly...

04:40.022 --> 04:41.057
Carly...

04:41.090 --> 04:42.624
Dad?

04:44.060 --> 04:45.194
Dad!

04:45.227 --> 04:46.528
Dad, my...

04:47.629 --> 04:49.497
Dad, can you hear me? Please.

04:49.531 --> 04:51.701
- Dad...
- Will you let us in?

04:55.071 --> 04:56.839
Carly!

04:56.872 --> 04:59.141
Carly, where are you?!

04:59.175 --> 05:01.677
- Luke?
- Carly, please!

05:02.912 --> 05:04.046
Luke?

05:08.818 --> 05:10.720
Oh, my God. Luke, are you okay?

05:10.753 --> 05:13.588
Yeah, I think so.

05:22.999 --> 05:24.734
Agh!

05:26.202 --> 05:29.972
All right! Fine.

05:30.006 --> 05:32.108
I'll let you in.

05:32.141 --> 05:34.043
I'll let you in.

06:12.614 --> 06:14.116
That trick never
gets old, Nana.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.352
Unlike my boobs.

06:16.385 --> 06:19.021
By next year, these bloody
things'll be hitting the floor.

06:19.055 --> 06:21.357
TMI, my lady.

06:21.390 --> 06:24.994
Emmy, both your dad and I
are working late tonight,

06:25.027 --> 06:28.197
and it's bridge night for Nana,
so can you Postmate dinner?

06:28.230 --> 06:32.201
They literally just moved
my Aronson meeting up to 9:00.

06:32.234 --> 06:34.870
Honey, is my gray suit
still at the cleaner?

06:34.904 --> 06:37.006
Oh, God, I forgot. I'm sorry.

06:37.039 --> 06:39.208
I'll pick it up
on my way back from my 7:00.

06:39.241 --> 06:40.843
Great. Love you. Thanks. Bye.

06:40.876 --> 06:43.045
So who's taking me to school?

06:43.079 --> 06:45.281
Uh, your father.

06:47.683 --> 06:48.951
Could have told me that before.

06:48.984 --> 06:50.853
Sweetheart, your lunch.

06:50.886 --> 06:52.288
Thank you, Nana.

06:54.190 --> 06:55.324
Dad!

06:58.961 --> 07:00.863
Oh, my God.
You could have waited for me.

07:00.896 --> 07:02.064
I'm so sorry.

07:27.022 --> 07:28.324
19 days and counting, huh?

07:28.357 --> 07:29.825
I know.

07:29.859 --> 07:31.360
Hopefully we
figure it out by then.

07:31.393 --> 07:32.928
It's in the bag, young lady.

07:32.962 --> 07:34.130
It's in the bag.

07:54.383 --> 07:56.285
Uh, sorry, babe.

07:56.318 --> 07:58.954
Seat's taken.

07:58.988 --> 08:01.724
- Oh, sorry.
- No worries.

08:05.494 --> 08:07.997
Honestly, it's so annoying.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.999
There's, like,
a million other seats here,

08:10.032 --> 08:12.801
and she has to sit
right next to me.

08:14.503 --> 08:15.771
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

08:15.804 --> 08:17.006
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:23.379 --> 08:26.148
Oh, God.

08:26.182 --> 08:27.816
I messed up.

08:31.153 --> 08:33.088
Oh, sorry, sweetie.

08:33.122 --> 08:35.024
I accidentally
sent that to you.

08:35.057 --> 08:38.327
You can just delete it. 'Kay?

08:38.360 --> 08:40.329
Oh, my God. This is so awkward.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.766
It's not like
you want to go anyway.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.100
It's not a rooftop party.

08:45.134 --> 08:47.469
But just in case,
think we're gonna need

08:47.503 --> 08:50.105
a no-murderers policy
at the door.

08:53.943 --> 08:54.977
What?

08:55.010 --> 08:56.111
Too soon?

08:56.145 --> 08:57.446
Bye, Felicia.

09:21.003 --> 09:23.339
Mommy, I didn't tie it.

09:33.415 --> 09:34.950
'Ey, what's up, Shark Tank?

09:34.984 --> 09:36.819
What's happening, Bisquick?

09:36.852 --> 09:38.487
Your convertors came in today.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.122
Finally.

09:40.155 --> 09:41.991
Come on, girl.

09:42.024 --> 09:44.960
I sell records and things,
and sometimes the things

09:44.994 --> 09:47.363
take a little longer
to get than the records.

09:47.396 --> 09:48.797
There you go.

09:48.831 --> 09:50.499
I get it. How much is it?

09:50.532 --> 09:52.968
Ah, you consider it
a donation, okay?

09:53.002 --> 09:54.536
Just go win the damn thing.

09:54.570 --> 09:57.373
Hmph. You know, they're wrong
about you, Bisquick.

09:57.406 --> 10:00.409
Yeah, well, you know,
they're all a bunch of idiots.

10:00.442 --> 10:02.444
Yeah. See you later!

10:02.478 --> 10:03.879
Go get 'em.

10:48.957 --> 10:50.893
Where have you been?

10:52.027 --> 10:53.862
Well, guess what came in today?

10:55.197 --> 10:56.598
Yes.

10:58.467 --> 11:01.003
We're gonna win this thing, Em.
You need to start thinking

11:01.036 --> 11:02.538
about if you're
gonna use the prize money

11:02.571 --> 11:05.207
to buy the Ford Challenger
or the Silverado,

11:05.240 --> 11:06.608
not to mention
what you'll be packing

11:06.642 --> 11:09.211
for our luxurious trip
to Cape Canaveral.

11:19.021 --> 11:21.557
This is where we make history.

11:21.590 --> 11:23.359
Dramatic much?

11:47.049 --> 11:48.484
I think it's gonna happen.

11:48.517 --> 11:50.586
I think it's about
to frickin' happen.

11:57.659 --> 11:58.961
Holy crap.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.414
Jeez.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.954
Oh, shoot.

12:25.988 --> 12:27.256
I'm so sorry.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.924
Am I interrupting
something huge here?

12:33.095 --> 12:36.064
I've told my sister
at least half a dozen times

12:36.098 --> 12:37.633
to park on the driveway

12:37.666 --> 12:39.668
between the hours
of 3:00 and 6:00.

12:39.702 --> 12:41.170
It's fine.

12:41.203 --> 12:43.205
It was exciting,
though, wasn't it, Em?

12:43.238 --> 12:45.174
Can you imagine
what it's gonna be like

12:45.207 --> 12:46.475
when it finally happens?

12:46.508 --> 12:47.976
It's gonna be lit.

12:48.010 --> 12:48.977
See you tomorrow?

12:49.011 --> 12:50.145
I'll be here.

12:51.547 --> 12:53.048
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:08.765 --> 13:11.433
The young teenagers were
last seen in this very area

13:11.467 --> 13:13.602
enjoying a social outing
on Saturday night

13:13.635 --> 13:16.071
and have yet to be
heard from since.

13:16.104 --> 13:18.207
She always answers her phone.

13:18.240 --> 13:22.077
And if she doesn't
have reception, she texts us.

13:22.110 --> 13:23.680
She's very responsible.

13:24.781 --> 13:27.483
I just want my baby back.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.251
I just want her back.

13:29.284 --> 13:32.187
Authorities have been
unable to uncover any clues,

13:32.221 --> 13:34.389
as there were
no eyewitnesses on the scene.

13:34.423 --> 13:38.360
Both Luke and Carly's parents
have initiated search parties.

13:42.097 --> 13:43.499
Postmates.

13:43.532 --> 13:46.268
Coming!

13:56.578 --> 13:58.748
Will you let us in?

13:58.781 --> 14:00.516
Uh, sorry.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.684
Thought you were Postmates.

14:05.354 --> 14:07.122
I think you have
the wrong house.

14:23.105 --> 14:24.673
Wh-where's my phone?

14:24.707 --> 14:26.108
Where's...

14:30.680 --> 14:32.514
911.
What is your emergency?

14:32.548 --> 14:35.217
Hi. Uh, there's people
trying to break in

14:35.250 --> 14:36.819
and...

14:36.853 --> 14:39.254
Will you let us in?

14:52.367 --> 14:53.736
- Hello? Hello?
- Yes, ma'am.

14:53.770 --> 14:55.671
I'm here.
Are these people in your house?

14:55.705 --> 14:57.606
No, but they're
trying to break in.

14:57.639 --> 14:59.274
Please send the police.
I'm all alone.

14:59.308 --> 15:00.810
Young lady,
the police are on their way.

15:00.843 --> 15:02.812
I'll stay on the phone
with you 'til they arrive.

15:02.845 --> 15:03.880
Thank you. Thank you.

15:03.913 --> 15:04.881
Ma'am, what's your name?

15:04.914 --> 15:06.548
Emily. My name's Emily.

15:06.582 --> 15:07.684
How old are you, Emily?

15:07.717 --> 15:09.318
- 12.
- Okay, Emily.

15:09.351 --> 15:10.519
Everything's going to be okay.

15:10.552 --> 15:12.120
Just take some deep breaths.

15:12.154 --> 15:13.655
Police will be there
before you know it.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.267
Will you let us in?

15:56.766 --> 16:01.303
So, uh, how many of these guys
were there again?

16:01.336 --> 16:02.839
Like, around five,

16:02.872 --> 16:05.674
but only one of them
broke through the skylight.

16:06.575 --> 16:09.879
So other than the, uh...

16:09.912 --> 16:13.181
black eyes, uh,
any other distinct

16:13.215 --> 16:15.952
or recognizable features
about them?

16:15.985 --> 16:19.154
Uh, isn't that enough?

16:21.256 --> 16:22.424
Yeah.

16:22.457 --> 16:23.860
That's good for now.

16:36.438 --> 16:38.340
I'm gonna be straight up
with you, Mark.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.709
I feel like we're still dealing

16:39.742 --> 16:41.844
with the lingering effects
of the incident.

16:41.878 --> 16:44.513
Uh, kids find her
an easy target,

16:44.546 --> 16:46.415
and I'm not condoning
that behavior,

16:46.448 --> 16:50.285
but I want to be clear about
what we're dealing with here.

16:50.318 --> 16:52.521
Aw, come on.
It's not exactly like they

16:52.554 --> 16:54.222
were toilet-papering the house

16:54.256 --> 16:56.726
or leaving a burning bag
of crap on the front step.

16:56.759 --> 16:58.995
These jerks
broke through our skylight.

16:59.028 --> 17:01.463
I mean, I think this is
a little more advanced.

17:01.496 --> 17:02.497
Well, that's just it.

17:02.531 --> 17:04.299
We checked the bathroom.

17:04.332 --> 17:05.802
Skylight's perfectly intact.

17:05.835 --> 17:09.237
No shards of glass
or trace of blood anywhere.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.994
Yuck! That is disgusting.

17:32.028 --> 17:34.563
Just the way I like it.

17:35.832 --> 17:37.466
Listen, Christopher.

17:37.499 --> 17:39.736
I don't know if I'm up
for hanging out tonight.

17:39.769 --> 17:41.938
We got popcorn,
your favorite movie.

17:41.971 --> 17:44.506
I'll even let you
dress me up like a girl.

17:45.507 --> 17:46.776
Can't even tell you how much

17:46.809 --> 17:48.477
I've been looking forward
to this evening,

17:48.510 --> 17:52.581
just me, Cherry Garcia,
and Netflix.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.517
At this rate, Mom,
you'll meet a man in no time.

17:55.550 --> 17:56.986
Appreciate it.

17:57.019 --> 17:58.587
Em, you doing okay, honey?

17:58.620 --> 17:59.654
I'm good. Thanks.

17:59.689 --> 18:01.423
They'll find those jerks.

18:01.456 --> 18:02.792
I hope so.

18:02.825 --> 18:04.559
You need anything,
you let me know,

18:04.593 --> 18:05.728
anything at all, 'kay?

18:05.762 --> 18:06.963
Thank you.

18:07.897 --> 18:10.599
Hey. Ooh, that smells good.

18:12.802 --> 18:15.504
Ugh. I don't think
you put enough butter on it.

18:15.537 --> 18:16.806
The king of excess.

18:16.839 --> 18:18.473
So true.

18:18.507 --> 18:19.942
What?

18:19.976 --> 18:22.310
I love your shoes, Jess.

18:22.344 --> 18:23.846
Thanks, Em.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.083
Mm, any way I can bribe you
to do my makeup tonight?

18:27.116 --> 18:29.518
Depends on the bribe.

18:29.551 --> 18:32.354
Mm, how 'bout one day

18:32.387 --> 18:33.856
of being driven
wherever you want to go?

18:33.890 --> 18:35.624
I'll be like
your personal Uber driver.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.392
Without the charges, of course.

18:39.427 --> 18:41.396
I'll sweeten the deal

18:41.429 --> 18:43.933
and throw in the Air Force 1s
for one day of wearing.

18:43.966 --> 18:44.967
Deal.

18:45.001 --> 18:46.601
Sweet. Let's go.

18:46.635 --> 18:48.336
Hold on a sec.

18:48.370 --> 18:51.640
Thought we were watching
Flying Saucer Rock 'N' Roll.

18:56.411 --> 18:57.814
Ugh!

18:58.848 --> 19:00.448
Might have overdid it.

19:02.718 --> 19:05.855
My God. That's really scary.

19:05.888 --> 19:08.124
I'm so sorry you had to go
through something like that.

19:08.157 --> 19:09.658
I-I can't even imagine.

19:10.659 --> 19:12.594
One thing you are is tough.

19:12.627 --> 19:15.031
Eh, not to mention talented.

19:15.064 --> 19:16.866
You know,
you should do tutorials.

19:16.899 --> 19:18.868
You'd have, like, way more
followers than Jeffree Star.

19:18.901 --> 19:20.368
I wish.

19:20.402 --> 19:21.737
No, seriously.

19:21.771 --> 19:23.438
You'd be doing a public service,

19:23.471 --> 19:24.774
considering how
most of the girls in my school

19:24.807 --> 19:25.942
walk around
looking like the Joker.

19:25.975 --> 19:27.810
That sounds familiar.

19:30.412 --> 19:31.513
How are they treating you?

19:31.546 --> 19:34.083
- Who?
- Girls at school.

19:34.116 --> 19:35.952
Oh, like crap.

19:35.985 --> 19:37.787
That good, huh?

19:37.820 --> 19:39.387
Yep.

19:40.690 --> 19:41.991
It won't last long.

19:42.024 --> 19:44.526
Trust me.
Things chance in high school.

19:45.828 --> 19:47.063
Hope so.

19:49.065 --> 19:51.600
Hey, why don't you come
to the party with me tonight?

19:51.633 --> 19:52.969
Huh?

19:53.002 --> 19:54.436
I mean, I heard
Tobey's little sister

19:54.469 --> 19:55.470
is bringing some
middle schoolers anyway.

19:55.503 --> 19:56.906
Oh, no. Scarlett is like

19:56.939 --> 19:59.041
the mob leader of the pack.
They all hate me.

19:59.075 --> 20:01.143
Okay, who cares?
I'm inviting you.

20:01.177 --> 20:03.045
Besides,
it's my boyfriend's party.

20:03.079 --> 20:05.014
Listen, Jess, I love that you're
inviting me and everything,

20:05.047 --> 20:07.083
but I don't think
it's the right move for me.

20:07.116 --> 20:08.751
Oh, of course it is.

20:08.784 --> 20:10.418
You'll be hanging out
with all the cool kids

20:10.452 --> 20:12.420
from high school,
instant street cred.

20:12.454 --> 20:13.890
Come on.

20:16.692 --> 20:18.928
I've nothing to wear.

20:18.961 --> 20:20.162
Well...

20:25.768 --> 20:26.969
now you do.

20:30.172 --> 20:31.741
Come on.

20:31.774 --> 20:33.642
Hey, Christopher.

20:33.675 --> 20:35.644
- Christopher.
- Hey, Christopher.

20:35.678 --> 20:38.948
Are you okay with me missing
Flying Saucer and going out?

20:38.981 --> 20:41.449
You know what?
I think he's Gucci with it.

20:41.483 --> 20:43.019
Yeah.

21:05.975 --> 21:07.243
Finally we can start the party.

21:07.276 --> 21:09.979
My queen has arrived.

21:11.613 --> 21:12.915
Oh, you're wearing
the cologne I got you.

21:12.949 --> 21:15.084
- Is it too much?
- No, perfect.

21:15.117 --> 21:16.518
Um, Tobey, this is Emily.

21:16.551 --> 21:18.120
She's basically
my little sister,

21:18.154 --> 21:19.822
so please make sure
everyone's nice to her tonight.

21:19.855 --> 21:21.489
Of course.
Nice to meet you, Emily.

21:21.523 --> 21:23.993
- Nice to meet you.
- Mi casa es su casa.

21:24.026 --> 21:25.728
Are you in, uh,
seventh or eighth?

21:25.761 --> 21:27.830
Uh, seventh.

21:27.863 --> 21:28.965
Then you must know my sister.

21:28.998 --> 21:30.700
Scarlett...

21:31.666 --> 21:32.802
you know Emily?

21:37.740 --> 21:39.742
Of course.

21:39.775 --> 21:42.945
TBH, wasn't really
expecting you to come.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.513
Oh, well, I invited her.

21:45.547 --> 21:46.916
That all right with you?

21:46.949 --> 21:48.516
Of course, Jess.

21:48.550 --> 21:50.119
No need to get salty.

21:50.152 --> 21:54.090
Scarlett, just make sure
Emily has fun, okay?

21:54.123 --> 21:55.791
Absolutely.

21:55.825 --> 21:58.626
What type of host
would I be if I didn't?

21:58.660 --> 22:00.628
Come on.
Everyone's in the other room.

22:03.265 --> 22:05.768
Those pants are straight fire.

22:05.801 --> 22:07.737
Thanks. I couldn't
really take credit for it.

22:07.770 --> 22:10.572
You could take credit
on how snatch they look on you.

22:16.078 --> 22:17.645
Truth.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.150
You make out
with Brandon at homecoming?

22:21.183 --> 22:22.852
That would be a yes.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.787
- Yuck. I...
- Eww. Eww.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.023
What? He's cute.

22:29.091 --> 22:31.193
What?

22:31.227 --> 22:33.963
It wasn't really
a make-out, make-out.

22:33.996 --> 22:36.631
He kissed me for,
like, a second on the lips.

22:39.601 --> 22:41.669
Well, actually,
it was on the cheek,

22:41.704 --> 22:44.840
but it was an air kiss,
so he didn't really kiss me,

22:44.874 --> 22:47.276
so the answer would be no.

22:47.309 --> 22:49.245
I didn't make out with him.

22:51.747 --> 22:54.016
Emily, this one's for you.

22:54.050 --> 22:55.718
Uh, no.

22:55.751 --> 22:57.619
I-I'm just a spectator.

22:57.652 --> 23:00.222
Don't be such a wimp, Sparks.

23:01.891 --> 23:04.160
Bam! Truth or dare?

23:04.193 --> 23:05.694
Uh, I'll have to pass.

23:05.728 --> 23:07.296
Oh, come on.

23:07.329 --> 23:10.166
You can't just go through life
sitting on the sidelines.

23:10.199 --> 23:11.233
Get in the game, thotty.

23:11.267 --> 23:13.335
All right. Leave her alone.

23:13.369 --> 23:17.006
If she wants to be
a little bee-yotch about it...

23:18.140 --> 23:20.675
then let her be
a little bee-yotch.

23:20.709 --> 23:23.712
Really? That's your game,
a reverse-psychology insult?

23:23.746 --> 23:25.848
We're not insulting you, babe.

23:25.881 --> 23:28.384
We're just calling you out.

23:28.417 --> 23:31.120
Seriously, Em.
I mean, there's a reason

23:31.153 --> 23:32.888
why you're not the most...

23:32.922 --> 23:34.123
liked girl at school.

23:35.724 --> 23:37.026
You'd think you want to make

23:37.059 --> 23:38.861
a little more
of an effort here, right?

23:38.894 --> 23:40.129
We can be your new besties,

23:40.162 --> 23:41.831
just as long
as you don't try to,

23:41.864 --> 23:44.733
you know, kill us, too.

23:44.767 --> 23:46.969
Oh, my God!

23:48.237 --> 23:49.305
You witch!

23:51.407 --> 23:52.775
My brand-new top.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.343
Oops.

24:23.139 --> 24:24.672
I hate her.

24:35.217 --> 24:37.286
What the...

24:37.319 --> 24:39.255
Turn on the freakin' light!

24:41.323 --> 24:43.159
Not funny, thotties.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.395
Ivy?

24:46.428 --> 24:47.796
Scarlett?

24:49.298 --> 24:53.102
Hello. I can see you
standing right by the door.

24:56.172 --> 24:58.107
Will you let us in?

24:58.140 --> 25:00.910
Brandon? That you?

25:00.943 --> 25:03.145
Honestly, you're so annoying.

25:05.981 --> 25:07.983
You guys are such jerks.

25:34.276 --> 25:35.444
What the...

25:38.781 --> 25:40.482
What the hell?

25:40.516 --> 25:42.484
Will you let us in?

25:44.086 --> 25:46.488
Okay. You guys are super creepy.

25:46.522 --> 25:48.190
You're Peter's friends, right?

25:48.224 --> 25:49.425
Didn't know you were into

25:49.458 --> 25:52.494
the whole
ratchet goth emo thing.

25:52.528 --> 25:55.097
Yeah, my friends aren't
really into that stuff.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.333
You know where Peter is?

25:59.301 --> 26:00.836
Okay, special needs.

26:00.869 --> 26:03.138
How 'bout you get
the hell out of my way?

26:05.140 --> 26:06.342
What are you doing?

26:20.322 --> 26:23.192
Never discuss it
with your parents?

26:24.260 --> 26:25.828
Not really.

26:25.861 --> 26:27.162
Why not?

26:28.130 --> 26:29.932
I don't know.

26:29.965 --> 26:31.834
I mean, they've been through
so much already.

26:31.867 --> 26:34.069
I don't really want
to bug them with it.

26:34.103 --> 26:36.972
That's very selfless of you.

26:38.073 --> 26:39.575
But you can't continue

26:39.608 --> 26:42.144
to carry the weight of this
on your own, Emily.

26:42.177 --> 26:43.579
It's not your fault.

26:43.612 --> 26:45.881
According to everyone else,
it is.

26:45.914 --> 26:48.350
It doesn't matter
what everyone else thinks.

26:49.351 --> 26:51.553
You know what the truth is,

26:51.587 --> 26:54.456
an unfortunate accident.

26:54.490 --> 26:56.125
It could have been you.

26:58.027 --> 26:59.228
Should have never told her to...

26:59.261 --> 27:00.829
Listen to me.

27:01.530 --> 27:05.467
It is not your fault.

27:05.501 --> 27:07.936
I know it may be
hard to accept it...

27:09.271 --> 27:11.540
but you can let it go.

27:20.149 --> 27:21.383
Bye, Dad!

28:05.961 --> 28:07.429
They filed
a missing persons report.

28:07.463 --> 28:09.965
She's been gone
since Saturday night.

28:09.998 --> 28:11.600
I was with her
on Saturday night.

28:11.633 --> 28:14.169
Really?
So you were at the party?

28:14.203 --> 28:16.472
Yeah, but I left early.

28:18.107 --> 28:20.209
It's awful. I just...

28:20.242 --> 28:23.011
hope she's okay.

28:23.045 --> 28:27.149
So tell me, what's going on
with the project?

28:27.182 --> 28:28.450
It's going, but I don't know

28:28.484 --> 28:30.252
if it's ever
gonna actually happen,

28:30.285 --> 28:32.955
but I just don't want
to crush Christopher's dreams

28:32.988 --> 28:34.590
of communicating with aliens.

28:34.623 --> 28:37.092
Emily, do you know how many
times Thomas Edison failed

28:37.126 --> 28:38.627
before finally inventing
the light bulb?

28:38.660 --> 28:40.496
Is this another one
of your dumb science jokes?

28:40.529 --> 28:43.365
Thousands.
He failed thousands of times

28:43.399 --> 28:44.666
before finally
getting it right.

28:44.701 --> 28:46.268
You guys are
nowhere near that.

28:46.301 --> 28:48.237
Keep it going.
You're gonna succeed.

28:48.270 --> 28:50.506
Not to mention the winner
gets a brand-new truck.

28:50.539 --> 28:52.574
And don't you want
a trip to Cape Canaveral?

28:52.608 --> 28:55.544
Yeah, I know. It'll be so cool.

28:57.579 --> 29:00.249
Keep on course, Em.

29:00.282 --> 29:01.617
You never know.

29:01.650 --> 29:04.420
You guys could be
the next Thomas Edison.

29:08.157 --> 29:09.992
It's been over five days
and counting

29:10.025 --> 29:13.061
as the hunt for Carly Hudson
and Luke Freitag continues.

29:13.095 --> 29:15.063
The community
has banded together in...

29:15.097 --> 29:17.232
I think these are
the best ones we've made.

29:17.266 --> 29:18.634
I mean, they're so on fleek.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.003
Ugh. Well, I imagine
that's a good thing.

29:21.036 --> 29:24.273
I think in your day, it would
be referred to as groovy.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.041
Oh, yeah. Okay.

29:26.074 --> 29:27.342
Yes, all right.

29:27.376 --> 29:30.012
Well, that is
definitely a good thing.

29:30.045 --> 29:32.014
Come on.
Don't cheap out on me, queen.

29:32.047 --> 29:33.750
Manson says
he wants to thank all...

29:42.057 --> 29:43.358
Who is it?

29:43.392 --> 29:45.260
Uh, hi there.
My name's Harold Lutz.

29:45.294 --> 29:46.562
I'm with the Times.

29:46.595 --> 29:49.164
Oh.
Oh, we're not interested.

29:49.198 --> 29:52.234
We already receive
the Daily News, but thank you.

29:52.267 --> 29:54.136
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, no, no, no.

29:54.169 --> 29:57.005
Um, I'm sorry. I'm not
selling subscriptions, ma'am.

29:57.039 --> 30:00.008
I'm a journalist with the Times.

30:00.042 --> 30:02.644
I'm writing a story
about the kidnappings.

30:08.584 --> 30:11.788
To date, there have been...

30:11.821 --> 30:13.790
three missing persons,

30:13.823 --> 30:16.693
all in the course
of just one week,

30:16.726 --> 30:19.127
all of whom are teenagers.

30:19.161 --> 30:24.132
And there's been no trace
of any evidence.

30:24.166 --> 30:26.769
Except for
a single eyewitness

30:26.803 --> 30:31.139
who saw a group of kids
wearing black hoodies.

30:31.173 --> 30:33.108
It was brought to my attention

30:33.141 --> 30:36.612
that you were the victim
of an attempted robbery

30:36.645 --> 30:40.282
involving a group of young kids
wearing black hoodies.

30:41.183 --> 30:43.118
Yet you managed to escape.

30:43.151 --> 30:44.086
Is that true?

30:45.822 --> 30:49.057
I think we ought
to wrap this up now, Mr. Lutz.

30:49.091 --> 30:52.127
Emily has to study
for an exam tomorrow, and she...

30:52.160 --> 30:53.362
Yes, it is true.

30:56.265 --> 30:58.500
They kept asking me
to let them in.

31:00.669 --> 31:03.505
Sorry. Uh, do you mind
if I record this?

31:09.779 --> 31:11.681
All of them were teenagers?

31:11.714 --> 31:13.382
Yeah. I...

31:13.415 --> 31:16.618
Well, not all
the same age and gender,

31:16.652 --> 31:20.589
but they had black eyes,

31:20.622 --> 31:23.492
like the entire eye was black.

31:23.525 --> 31:26.628
And they had
extremely pale skin.

31:28.597 --> 31:30.232
They smelled really bad,

31:30.265 --> 31:34.136
like a mixture
of really old cheese and butt.

31:34.169 --> 31:36.471
That's, uh, vividly descriptive.

31:36.505 --> 31:38.808
Yeah, I'm just trying
to paint a picture for you.

31:38.841 --> 31:41.711
It's very helpful.

31:41.744 --> 31:44.546
You said that they asked you
to let them in?

31:44.580 --> 31:46.582
Did they mean into your home?

31:46.615 --> 31:48.685
Yeah, I guess.

31:50.452 --> 31:53.155
I don't know.

31:53.188 --> 31:55.157
The thing is,
this is a really small town,

31:55.190 --> 31:58.560
and I've never seen
kids like this before ever.

32:07.369 --> 32:09.872
Besties pact.
We do everything together,

32:09.906 --> 32:11.273
no matter what.

32:11.306 --> 32:12.742
No matter what.

32:12.775 --> 32:14.543
Okay, here we go.

32:14.576 --> 32:16.813
But you go first.
I'm still nervous.

32:16.846 --> 32:18.681
It'll be fine. Trust me.

32:18.715 --> 32:20.182
You ready?

32:20.215 --> 32:21.550
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.619
One...

32:25.822 --> 32:27.389
two...

32:29.792 --> 32:31.560
three!

32:58.755 --> 33:00.622
All I did was tweak
the frequency a fraction,

33:00.656 --> 33:03.760
and then, boom,
it was real quick,

33:03.793 --> 33:05.728
literally like three seconds,

33:05.762 --> 33:08.397
and then all the power
just shut down.

33:08.430 --> 33:09.799
No offense, Christopher,

33:09.832 --> 33:11.633
but I don't think
a tiny movement of needles

33:11.667 --> 33:13.235
is proof of communication.

33:13.268 --> 33:15.671
Trust me, it was
nothing we've heard before.

33:19.574 --> 33:21.778
This shihizzle's for real.

33:47.937 --> 33:49.906
Jungspars.

33:54.342 --> 33:55.477
What?!

33:56.746 --> 33:58.881
Christopher, my dear friend,

33:58.915 --> 34:01.684
I think that we need
to finally come to terms

34:01.718 --> 34:03.485
that this is probably
never gonna happen.

34:03.518 --> 34:05.021
What are you saying?

34:05.054 --> 34:07.757
I'm saying that we've put in
a great effort here,

34:07.790 --> 34:10.026
but I think we should try
something more realistic.

34:10.059 --> 34:12.360
So you're just going to quit?

34:12.394 --> 34:14.329
No, I'm not saying quit.

34:14.362 --> 34:16.866
I'm just saying we should
figure out something else.

34:16.899 --> 34:20.036
Emily, persistence is
science's middle name.

34:20.069 --> 34:21.971
You know how many times
it took Edison

34:22.004 --> 34:23.973
to finally invent
the light bulb?

34:24.006 --> 34:26.374
- Thousands.
- Yes! How'd you know?

34:26.408 --> 34:27.810
'Cause I know everything.

34:27.844 --> 34:30.278
If you did, you'd realize
that we are so close

34:30.312 --> 34:32.414
to communicating
with whatever is out there.

34:32.447 --> 34:33.950
Well, what if there's
nothing out there?

34:33.983 --> 34:36.551
You and I both know that
there's something out there,

34:36.585 --> 34:38.620
and we are destined
to communicate with them.

34:38.653 --> 34:40.422
I stan your passion,
Christopher,

34:40.455 --> 34:42.959
but I think
I'm gonna cut my losses.

34:42.992 --> 34:46.328
Emily, come on.
You can't do this.

34:48.630 --> 34:50.432
Jungspars.

34:51.901 --> 34:53.635
Jungspars.

34:57.506 --> 34:59.742
Jungspars.

35:08.751 --> 35:09.919
Go ahead.

35:18.393 --> 35:19.494
Hello.

35:19.528 --> 35:22.064
Uh, it's me, Emily Sparks,

35:22.098 --> 35:24.432
coming to you from Earth.

35:24.466 --> 35:26.002
Uh, you probably
don't understand

35:26.035 --> 35:28.004
a word I'm saying
right now, but, uh,

35:28.037 --> 35:29.604
me and my friend Christopher

35:29.638 --> 35:31.573
created this
communication device

35:31.606 --> 35:34.076
to try to talk to aliens,
and I guess it works.

35:34.110 --> 35:35.778
Give 'em the Cliffnotes,

35:35.812 --> 35:36.779
not the novel.

35:36.813 --> 35:38.748
Okay. Oh, you're right.

35:38.781 --> 35:40.348
Keep it tight. Okay.

35:40.382 --> 35:42.617
So, uh, tell us
a little bit about you.

35:43.786 --> 35:45.988
Emily.

35:46.889 --> 35:48.090
Did it just say my name?!

35:48.124 --> 35:49.624
- It just said your name!
- Oh, my God!

35:49.658 --> 35:50.993
- It just said my name!
- It said your name!

35:51.027 --> 35:53.461
Said my name. Oh, my God.

35:54.496 --> 35:56.598
Christopher.

35:56.631 --> 35:58.100
What?!

35:58.134 --> 36:00.136
- They just said your name?
- They just said my name!

36:00.169 --> 36:03.039
- They said your name!
- Oh, my God!

36:03.072 --> 36:05.340
Jungspars.

36:08.476 --> 36:10.445
Jungspar.

36:12.782 --> 36:14.150
Jungspar? Who's Jungspar?

36:19.621 --> 36:22.457
And you wanted to quit.

36:54.090 --> 36:55.390
Can I help you?

36:56.158 --> 36:57.894
Will you let us in?

36:57.927 --> 36:59.962
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
We're actually closed.

36:59.996 --> 37:03.431
We open up again
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

37:03.465 --> 37:05.735
Our friend is quite dehydrated.

37:05.768 --> 37:09.537
We're just looking
for something cold to drink.

37:09.571 --> 37:11.640
Uh, sorry. I already
closed the register,

37:11.673 --> 37:13.541
so I can't really
sell you anything.

37:13.575 --> 37:15.778
Um, there's a Smart and Zip
around the corner.

37:15.811 --> 37:17.179
They're open 24 hours.

37:22.018 --> 37:23.986
Okay. Have a nice night.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.623
Creepy much?

37:53.749 --> 37:56.584
Will you let us in?

38:44.800 --> 38:46.936
Come on. Come on. Come on.

38:46.969 --> 38:48.771
Come on.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.239
Come on!

38:53.275 --> 38:55.044
Jessie, it's me.
Open up.

38:55.077 --> 38:56.578
- Tobey?
- Open up, babe.

38:56.611 --> 38:57.880
Everything's okay.

39:01.984 --> 39:04.086
Will you let us in?

39:18.834 --> 39:20.602
Will you let us in?

39:20.635 --> 39:23.072
Screw you.

39:25.341 --> 39:27.309
Ouch.

39:32.782 --> 39:34.683
Okay, I'll let you in!

39:34.717 --> 39:36.551
I'll let you in.

39:40.956 --> 39:42.725
I mean,
just the fact that you guys

39:42.758 --> 39:44.293
worked so hard
putting this together

39:44.326 --> 39:46.762
and got something or somebody
to communicate back

39:46.796 --> 39:48.330
is absolutely incredible.

39:48.364 --> 39:50.866
I am so proud of both of you.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.667
Emily, honey,
are you staying for dinner?

39:52.701 --> 39:53.969
Sure. I guess.

39:56.105 --> 39:59.875
Sweetie, we have to wash those
before you eat them. Remember?

39:59.909 --> 40:02.044
You had that horrible bout
of diarrhea last time.

40:02.078 --> 40:03.813
Jesus, Mom. Have a little couth.

40:03.846 --> 40:05.948
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right.
Well, will you please

40:05.981 --> 40:07.249
tell your sister
to come downstairs?

40:07.283 --> 40:09.151
And if you
have to use the bathroom,

40:09.185 --> 40:10.652
please use wet wipes.

40:10.686 --> 40:13.989
Hysterical, Mom,
but Jessie's not home.

40:14.023 --> 40:15.091
Where is she?

40:15.124 --> 40:16.725
I don't know.

40:16.759 --> 40:19.361
Her shift ended an hour ago.
Is her car here?

40:21.430 --> 40:24.233
I told her no Tobey's
until the weekend.

40:26.068 --> 40:28.237
Oh, you are
in serious trouble, Missy,

40:28.270 --> 40:30.706
sending me
straight to voicemail.

40:32.408 --> 40:34.143
Christopher, please
set up the table, sweetie.

40:34.176 --> 40:36.312
- I got it.
- Thank you.

40:40.950 --> 40:42.785
Wait.
So has she not responded?

40:42.818 --> 40:45.054
No, and she usually does
right away.

40:45.087 --> 40:46.822
I'll solve this
once and for all.

40:52.428 --> 40:54.763
She's still at work.

40:55.798 --> 40:57.433
What?

40:57.466 --> 40:59.034
How could she still be there?

41:11.080 --> 41:13.048
It's locked.

41:16.785 --> 41:18.787
Jessie! Jessie, you in there?!

41:18.821 --> 41:20.689
Let me go check the back door.

41:32.835 --> 41:33.969
Jessie?

41:36.005 --> 41:37.740
Mom. Mom.

41:37.773 --> 41:40.075
- Huh?
- Give me a minute.

41:40.109 --> 41:42.244
- What?
- I think I just sharted.

41:42.278 --> 41:44.446
Honey, I told you
not to eat those grapes.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.949
I know, Mom. I was just hungry.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.751
I'm a growing boy, you know.

42:28.424 --> 42:29.391
Freeze!

42:36.232 --> 42:39.368
Um, I-I think
it was around 5:00.

42:39.401 --> 42:41.303
It was a text from her.

42:41.337 --> 42:43.172
My God, I can't believe
this is happening.

42:43.205 --> 42:45.507
You need to find her.
You need to find her now.

42:45.541 --> 42:48.377
There are so many kids missing.
Something bad is happening.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.881
I'm scared, Em.

42:55.351 --> 42:57.386
I'm really scared.

43:14.236 --> 43:15.204
Hello there, Emily.

43:15.237 --> 43:16.405
Hi, Mr. Lutz.

43:16.438 --> 43:18.841
This is my friend Christopher.

43:18.874 --> 43:20.075
Nice to meet you, Christopher.

43:20.109 --> 43:22.778
Uh, please come in.

43:28.851 --> 43:30.552
Including your sister,
Christopher,

43:30.586 --> 43:34.857
there's been seven missing
persons reports this week alone.

43:34.890 --> 43:37.526
So do you know who these kids
are or where they're from?

43:37.559 --> 43:39.061
No. No one does.

43:39.094 --> 43:40.896
That's what makes it
so frustrating.

43:40.929 --> 43:44.500
Some say it's a bunch
of meth kids from Canopy Falls.

43:44.533 --> 43:47.836
Others think
it's a type of zombie.

43:47.870 --> 43:50.506
But in all the research
I've done,

43:50.539 --> 43:53.075
there's only been
one other account

43:53.108 --> 43:55.377
of these black-eyed kids.

43:56.912 --> 44:00.249
It happened in this town
over 50 years ago.

44:00.282 --> 44:03.052
Over 25 missing persons,

44:03.085 --> 44:05.554
and there was
only one eyewitness.

44:07.056 --> 44:11.226
And his name is Frederick Munch.

44:13.395 --> 44:17.066
He and his fiancée were taken
five days before their wedding.

44:17.099 --> 44:19.335
Apparently they let him go.

44:19.368 --> 44:20.936
Why?

44:20.969 --> 44:23.205
You'd have to ask him.

44:23.238 --> 44:25.140
Is he still alive?

44:25.174 --> 44:26.141
He is.

44:26.175 --> 44:28.444
He lives over on Elm.

44:29.511 --> 44:32.614
Wait, Munch.
You mean Mean Mr. Munch?

44:32.648 --> 44:34.283
You know him?

44:34.316 --> 44:35.351
Yeah.

44:35.384 --> 44:36.919
All the kids know him.

44:36.952 --> 44:38.620
His house is totally haunted.

44:38.654 --> 44:40.656
Yeah, the kids created
the Munch challenge.

44:40.690 --> 44:42.958
It's where you gotta walk up
to his creepy doorsteps

44:42.991 --> 44:45.594
and ring his creepy doorbell
and try to make it out alive,

44:45.627 --> 44:47.896
and one kid tried it, and...

44:47.930 --> 44:49.531
He made it...

44:49.565 --> 44:52.401
but then broke into a seizure
the minute he got home.

44:54.236 --> 44:57.106
Well, I've been trying to talk
to him for the last six months.

44:57.139 --> 45:01.009
Threatened to kill me
if I stepped on his property.

45:01.043 --> 45:03.011
I'll talk to him.

45:03.045 --> 45:04.079
You're kidding.

45:04.113 --> 45:05.180
No, and you're coming.

45:05.214 --> 45:07.082
That's not a good idea, Emily.

45:08.050 --> 45:09.618
You have a better one?

45:17.727 --> 45:19.428
- Emily...
- Yeah?

45:19.461 --> 45:20.596
I'm quaking.

45:20.629 --> 45:22.264
Yeah, me, too.

45:22.297 --> 45:25.033
What if he cuts our heads off

45:25.067 --> 45:27.069
and uses our bodies
as flotation devices?

45:27.102 --> 45:29.338
I don't think that's possible.
Bodies don't float.

45:29.371 --> 45:30.939
We can literally run now,

45:30.973 --> 45:33.275
and the least we'll suffer
is a seizure.

45:48.657 --> 45:50.959
Okay, obviously
he's not home, so...

45:50.993 --> 45:52.227
Leave it by the door.

45:52.261 --> 45:54.163
Uh, hi, Mr. Munch. I'm Emily,

45:54.196 --> 45:55.497
and this is
my friend Christopher.

45:55.531 --> 45:57.065
We live down the street.

45:57.099 --> 45:58.033
Uh-huh.

45:59.601 --> 46:02.504
Uh, Mr. Munch?

46:02.538 --> 46:04.373
Mr. Munch!

46:05.374 --> 46:08.644
Oh, well. We tried.

46:13.282 --> 46:15.718
Emily, come on. He obviously
doesn't want us here.

46:15.752 --> 46:17.119
We're finding your sister.

46:18.320 --> 46:20.422
Get off my property.

46:20.456 --> 46:22.357
Mr. Munch, please help us.

46:22.391 --> 46:24.326
Christopher's sister has been
taken by the black-eyed kids.

46:24.359 --> 46:26.462
Please just let us...

46:28.330 --> 46:29.531
We should go.

46:44.546 --> 46:47.015
Holy crap.

47:02.197 --> 47:04.032
Creepy A.F.

47:25.688 --> 47:27.155
Jesus Christ.

47:41.704 --> 47:44.406
Could this house
be any creepier?

47:44.439 --> 47:45.641
Shh.

47:49.444 --> 47:51.380
I didn't
know someone so creepy

47:51.413 --> 47:53.615
could be so talented.

47:53.649 --> 47:55.217
Christopher, shut up.

48:09.799 --> 48:12.100
I think I just urinated myself.

48:12.134 --> 48:13.468
Emily...

48:14.904 --> 48:16.338
Come on. Get a grip.

48:53.475 --> 48:55.410
I haven't had one lesson.

49:02.618 --> 49:04.787
I appreciate you letting us in.

49:04.821 --> 49:06.689
That supposed to be a joke?

49:06.723 --> 49:08.590
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean it that way.

49:08.624 --> 49:10.860
We're just trying to get
all the information we can get.

49:10.893 --> 49:12.829
The black-eyed kids.

49:12.862 --> 49:16.164
Yes, exactly.

49:16.198 --> 49:18.266
I haven't talked about this

49:18.300 --> 49:19.869
in more than 50 years.

49:21.536 --> 49:23.405
I was too scared to.

49:27.509 --> 49:31.546
But with all
the kidnappings going on,

49:31.580 --> 49:33.649
I feel I need to.

49:33.683 --> 49:35.150
Thank you.

49:38.955 --> 49:41.758
I saw 'em first
in the winter of '59.

49:43.325 --> 49:46.829
They took me and my fiancée...

49:48.363 --> 49:49.866
all of 'em...

49:50.900 --> 49:53.502
with their alabaster skin...

49:55.537 --> 49:57.372
and that jet-black hair...

49:59.341 --> 50:00.676
black eyes.

50:03.378 --> 50:05.480
Black as briquettes.

50:09.686 --> 50:12.254
They had this awful odor.

50:13.956 --> 50:15.524
Awful.

50:19.028 --> 50:20.629
Smelled like...

50:21.964 --> 50:24.934
rotten molasses and, uh...

50:24.967 --> 50:26.468
pig droppings.

50:27.937 --> 50:30.338
I can still smell it today.

50:32.875 --> 50:35.978
They ended up taking
my sweet Juniper.

50:37.013 --> 50:38.580
My fiancée.

50:42.719 --> 50:44.386
And they let me go.

50:46.889 --> 50:50.525
There's not a day that I
don't wish it was the opposite.

50:50.559 --> 50:52.427
So where did they take her?

50:52.461 --> 50:55.297
Some sort of portal.

50:55.330 --> 50:57.265
A portal?

50:57.299 --> 50:58.533
To where?

50:59.736 --> 51:01.570
Space.

51:01.603 --> 51:02.872
Space?

51:04.339 --> 51:06.274
Space.

51:06.308 --> 51:08.276
Outer space.

51:08.310 --> 51:11.313
Like outer outer space?

51:11.346 --> 51:13.482
Like rocket ship outer space?

51:13.515 --> 51:15.785
This kid on the spectrum?

51:15.818 --> 51:17.652
Yeah, of course.

51:18.620 --> 51:20.857
Outer space.

51:20.890 --> 51:24.559
So are these
black-eyed kids aliens?

51:24.593 --> 51:26.328
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

51:28.530 --> 51:31.533
They don't refer to themselves
as black-eyed kids.

51:34.771 --> 51:37.006
They call themselves Jungspars.

51:39.574 --> 51:41.276
Jungspars?

51:46.082 --> 51:49.786
Every 20 years,
they come to Earth...

51:50.920 --> 51:53.923
to abduct
adolescent girls and boys.

51:53.956 --> 51:57.093
It's their harvesting time...

51:57.126 --> 51:59.461
a way for them
to propagate the human race

51:59.494 --> 52:01.931
on their planet for slavery.

52:08.470 --> 52:12.909
I was there. I've seen it.

52:14.409 --> 52:17.379
And believe me,
you don't want to see

52:17.412 --> 52:19.849
the things that I've seen.

52:25.721 --> 52:27.857
You've seen them, too,
haven't you?

52:27.890 --> 52:31.393
So why do they ask you
that question,

52:31.426 --> 52:32.862
to let them in?

52:33.930 --> 52:35.463
Because they have to.

52:36.631 --> 52:38.500
They need permission.

52:40.803 --> 52:43.405
They don't like
being said no to.

52:44.439 --> 52:47.342
So they will terrorize you...

52:48.044 --> 52:49.611
until you say yes.

52:49.644 --> 52:52.949
But whatever you do,
never say yes.

52:52.982 --> 52:58.154
Trust me when I tell you
the pain that you will suffer.

52:58.187 --> 53:00.790
Saying no will be nothing

53:00.823 --> 53:05.560
compared to the pain that
you'll suffer if you say yes.

53:05.594 --> 53:08.463
So how long
do they stay here for?

53:08.496 --> 53:11.000
After researching,

53:11.033 --> 53:15.604
I discovered that the duration
of each stay

53:15.637 --> 53:18.540
was ten nights
from the first abduction,

53:18.573 --> 53:20.609
not a minute later.

53:20.642 --> 53:22.644
Holy crap.

53:22.677 --> 53:24.412
I'm sorry, Mr. Munch,
but I have to go.

53:24.446 --> 53:26.448
Hold on just one second,
young lady.

53:31.821 --> 53:33.022
Take that.

53:35.057 --> 53:37.760
In case you need
to summon them...

53:38.895 --> 53:40.863
or cause severe pain.

53:42.798 --> 53:43.900
Thanks.

53:45.701 --> 53:47.803
I gotta skirt, too,

53:47.837 --> 53:50.072
but nice meeting you.

53:53.743 --> 53:55.044
I get it.

53:55.077 --> 53:57.079
I'm a germophobe, too.

53:57.113 --> 53:58.580
Fist bump club?

54:03.019 --> 54:04.452
All good.

54:10.558 --> 54:12.995
Hurry up.
We only have 'til midnight.

54:13.029 --> 54:16.498
I'm doing it as fast as I can!
Jesus!

54:40.723 --> 54:42.657
Jungspars.

54:48.097 --> 54:49.265
Jungspars.

54:57.139 --> 54:58.240
Damn it!

55:05.848 --> 55:08.516
Bisquick! Let us in!

55:15.691 --> 55:16.959
Thanks, Bisquick!

55:16.993 --> 55:19.494
Go get 'em, Shark Tank.

56:00.736 --> 56:02.772
Jungspars.

56:06.308 --> 56:08.543
No, no, no, no, no!

56:17.219 --> 56:18.788
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

56:25.961 --> 56:28.764
Jungspars.

56:37.206 --> 56:38.941
Hello.

56:38.974 --> 56:41.277
It's us, Emily and Christopher.

56:41.310 --> 56:43.879
Uh, last time
we talked on here,

56:43.913 --> 56:46.682
you mentioned
the word "Jungspars."

56:46.715 --> 56:49.185
Could... could you please
tells us more about that?

56:53.189 --> 56:54.990
Hello?

56:55.024 --> 56:56.158
Can you hear me?

57:01.063 --> 57:02.898
Uh, it's us,
Emily and Christopher,

57:02.932 --> 57:06.402
and we wanted to know some
more information on Jungspars.

57:13.275 --> 57:14.977
Emily.

57:15.010 --> 57:16.745
Christopher.

57:16.779 --> 57:18.981
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay, okay.

57:19.014 --> 57:21.851
Okay. Uh, it's us,
Yeah, Emily and Christopher.

57:21.884 --> 57:24.120
Um, what do we call you?

57:25.221 --> 57:27.089
Kluuk.

57:27.123 --> 57:29.158
Okay, Kluuk.

57:29.191 --> 57:31.060
Nice to officially meet you.

57:31.093 --> 57:35.164
So, uh, can you tell us
more about Jungspars?

57:37.967 --> 57:39.802
Jungspars.

57:40.970 --> 57:42.404
Emily...

57:42.438 --> 57:45.074
beat them.

57:46.008 --> 57:47.109
How do we beat them?

57:47.143 --> 57:48.676
H-how do we do that?

57:50.212 --> 57:52.314
Shine.

57:52.348 --> 57:55.784
Shine? Shine what?

58:00.022 --> 58:00.990
Hello?

58:02.158 --> 58:04.093
Light.

58:06.162 --> 58:07.863
Shine.

58:08.998 --> 58:11.167
Shine light?

58:12.067 --> 58:14.203
Shine...

58:14.236 --> 58:15.371
the...

58:16.372 --> 58:18.107
light.

59:00.516 --> 59:02.985
This is insane.

59:03.018 --> 59:05.454
I told you no one would show up.

59:05.487 --> 59:06.989
Give it a minute.

59:07.022 --> 59:08.857
Not to mention
you made it so convenient

59:08.891 --> 59:11.827
for them to chop our parts
into a hundred pieces

59:11.860 --> 59:13.829
and bury us in the forest.

59:13.862 --> 59:15.898
Christopher, they don't murder.
They abduct.

59:15.931 --> 59:18.968
Oh, well, that makes me
feel so much better.

59:21.270 --> 59:23.072
They're not coming, Em.

59:23.105 --> 59:25.007
Think we need to reassess.

59:25.908 --> 59:27.009
They'll show up.

59:32.448 --> 59:34.183
Oh, Jesus. The things I do

59:34.216 --> 59:35.484
because I have a crush on you.

59:35.517 --> 59:36.552
What?

59:36.585 --> 59:39.088
Uh, I-I didn't say anything.

59:56.238 --> 59:57.239
Hey.

59:57.273 --> 59:59.975
Appreciate you showing up.

1:00:02.044 --> 1:00:03.846
Of course.

1:00:03.879 --> 1:00:07.016
So how do we get them back?

1:00:12.121 --> 1:00:14.556
- This is stupid.
- This isn't gonna work.

1:00:25.401 --> 1:00:26.402
I mean, seriously?

1:00:28.203 --> 1:00:30.072
Good plan, Emily.

1:00:31.607 --> 1:00:35.177
Well, guess the old dude
gave us a defect.

1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:40.149
Uh, Emily.

1:00:49.525 --> 1:00:51.593
Will you let us in?

1:00:51.627 --> 1:00:53.996
No chance...

1:00:54.029 --> 1:00:55.197
witch.

1:00:56.899 --> 1:00:58.967
Now!

1:01:09.511 --> 1:01:11.914
Oh, snap. This worked.

1:01:11.947 --> 1:01:13.515
This frickin' worked.

1:01:19.088 --> 1:01:20.356
Come on, Christopher.

1:01:43.445 --> 1:01:45.013
Now!

1:01:50.319 --> 1:01:52.955
Just tell us where our friends
are, and we'll let you go.

1:01:52.988 --> 1:01:56.558
Where are our friends?

1:01:56.592 --> 1:01:59.061
Tell us where our friends are,
and we'll let you go.

1:02:03.966 --> 1:02:05.334
High beams!

1:02:23.419 --> 1:02:24.386
Christopher.

1:02:24.420 --> 1:02:25.954
Christopher!

1:02:26.689 --> 1:02:29.458
Christopher! Christopher!

1:02:29.491 --> 1:02:31.093
Emily, have you seen Scarlett?

1:02:31.126 --> 1:02:32.661
No. Have you seen Christopher?

1:02:33.562 --> 1:02:37.099
Christopher! Christopher.

1:02:37.132 --> 1:02:38.600
Christopher!

1:02:39.535 --> 1:02:41.336
Christopher!

1:02:42.471 --> 1:02:45.274
Christopher!

1:02:48.544 --> 1:02:50.312
Well,
you seem to have a knack

1:02:50.345 --> 1:02:52.448
for getting caught in the eye
of the storm, young lady.

1:02:52.481 --> 1:02:54.383
They took Christopher!
I need to find him!

1:02:54.416 --> 1:02:56.018
And we will find him.

1:02:56.051 --> 1:02:58.520
In the meantime,
I want you to stay put

1:02:58.554 --> 1:03:00.556
and focus on being here,
where you're safe.

1:03:00.589 --> 1:03:02.424
You guys don't understand.
They're not human!

1:03:02.458 --> 1:03:04.293
You don't know how they think!

1:03:06.562 --> 1:03:09.699
Emily, let me
make myself clear.

1:03:09.732 --> 1:03:13.068
If you leave this house,
I'm gonna have you arrested.

1:03:13.101 --> 1:03:14.369
Are you comprehending me?

1:03:14.403 --> 1:03:16.004
You gotta be kidding me.

1:03:16.038 --> 1:03:17.339
Serious as a tornado.

1:03:17.372 --> 1:03:19.174
You guys don't understand

1:03:19.208 --> 1:03:20.777
that the people who are
still missing are still alive,

1:03:20.810 --> 1:03:23.111
are we're running out of time!

1:03:24.546 --> 1:03:26.381
Get some sleep.

1:03:29.618 --> 1:03:31.453
We'll be right back, honey.

1:03:50.807 --> 1:03:53.175
And this is
the exact same location

1:03:53.208 --> 1:03:56.178
where both Carly Hudson and
Luke Freitag were taken from.

1:03:56.211 --> 1:03:57.579
Authorities still have no clue

1:03:57.613 --> 1:03:59.548
as to who's involved
in these snatchings,

1:03:59.581 --> 1:04:02.685
but eyewitnesses
believe they're not human.

1:04:02.719 --> 1:04:05.153
They're not human.
I don't know what they are.

1:04:05.187 --> 1:04:07.623
- Where's Scarlett?
- Christopher!

1:04:07.656 --> 1:04:09.324
Christopher!

1:04:10.727 --> 1:04:12.695
Christopher!

1:04:12.729 --> 1:04:14.229
Where's Christopher?!

1:04:45.193 --> 1:04:46.528
Oh, damn it.

1:04:47.529 --> 1:04:48.630
Oh, what am I...

1:04:59.241 --> 1:05:01.410
Come in.

1:05:01.443 --> 1:05:03.145
They've got you
in isolation, huh?

1:05:03.178 --> 1:05:05.213
Ah, Nana, please,
you gotta get me out of here.

1:05:05.247 --> 1:05:06.281
They've taken Christopher.

1:05:06.315 --> 1:05:09.518
Ohh. Sweetheart...

1:05:09.551 --> 1:05:11.620
the police will take care of it.

1:05:11.653 --> 1:05:14.891
No, they don't even
know where he is! But I do.

1:05:14.924 --> 1:05:17.626
Well, you tell them then.

1:05:17.659 --> 1:05:19.796
No, they think I'm crazy, Nana.

1:05:19.829 --> 1:05:22.531
They don't believe me
when I try to tell them!

1:05:23.700 --> 1:05:25.868
Look, you know
my friend Cindy's dad's

1:05:25.902 --> 1:05:27.369
a policeman, right?

1:05:27.402 --> 1:05:29.671
So all I want to do
is just tell him,

1:05:29.706 --> 1:05:31.440
and he'll take care
of everything.

1:05:31.473 --> 1:05:34.142
So please just let me
get out of here

1:05:34.176 --> 1:05:35.277
so I can do that.

1:05:35.310 --> 1:05:36.445
Sweetheart.

1:05:36.478 --> 1:05:38.280
Please, Nana.

1:05:38.313 --> 1:05:41.818
I don't want to lose
another best friend.

1:05:45.688 --> 1:05:47.322
I think we need to take

1:05:47.356 --> 1:05:50.359
a lot more responsibility
for what's going on here.

1:05:50.392 --> 1:05:53.462
I mean, when do you actually
spend quality time with her,

1:05:53.495 --> 1:05:56.198
- just the two of you?
- Oh, okay. Okay,

1:05:56.231 --> 1:05:58.433
so all this going on
right now is 'cause of me?

1:05:58.467 --> 1:06:00.669
- Is that right?
- Well, possibly.

1:06:04.206 --> 1:06:05.607
Mom!

1:06:05.641 --> 1:06:07.175
I've fallen...

1:06:07.209 --> 1:06:08.543
and I can't get up.

1:06:08.577 --> 1:06:09.879
- God. Okay, what happened?
- Oh, my God.

1:06:09.912 --> 1:06:11.446
Can I help you up? Come on.

1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:13.281
- I don't know.
- Here we go. Here we go.

1:06:13.315 --> 1:06:15.384
Okay. Okay?

1:06:15.417 --> 1:06:18.353
Yeah. I don't know.

1:06:49.618 --> 1:06:51.219
Shoot.

1:07:11.373 --> 1:07:13.275
Need a hand?

1:07:15.812 --> 1:07:19.882
Maybe this isn't the safest
place to be right now, you know?

1:07:19.916 --> 1:07:21.818
We're really close.

1:07:25.855 --> 1:07:27.924
It says
he's literally right here.

1:07:31.894 --> 1:07:33.228
May I?

1:07:33.930 --> 1:07:35.263
Sure.

1:07:46.308 --> 1:07:47.810
You're right. He's right here,

1:07:47.844 --> 1:07:50.512
or at least
his phone's right here.

1:08:01.456 --> 1:08:02.992
We need to hurry up.

1:08:03.025 --> 1:08:04.593
It's almost midnight!

1:08:04.626 --> 1:08:06.062
This way.

1:08:06.095 --> 1:08:07.395
Come on.

1:08:35.691 --> 1:08:37.093
What is this?

1:08:37.126 --> 1:08:40.428
I think we found their Airbnb.

1:08:54.509 --> 1:08:57.612
I'm starting to think
this wasn't such a good idea.

1:09:15.497 --> 1:09:16.866
What do we do now?

1:09:20.736 --> 1:09:21.804
Seriously?

1:09:21.838 --> 1:09:23.438
You got a better idea?

1:09:42.557 --> 1:09:44.026
Hey there, buddy.

1:09:44.060 --> 1:09:45.695
Just gonna take
some of our friends back home.

1:09:45.728 --> 1:09:46.929
You cool with that?

1:10:07.083 --> 1:10:09.151
Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?

1:10:09.185 --> 1:10:10.552
Thank goodness you're here.

1:10:10.585 --> 1:10:12.722
Oh, my God. Yeah.
How did you...

1:10:12.755 --> 1:10:14.589
We're trying to get
you guys out of here.

1:10:14.623 --> 1:10:15.992
- Please help.
- Oh, my God.

1:10:16.025 --> 1:10:17.727
Get us out.

1:10:23.032 --> 1:10:24.432
Move.

1:10:25.768 --> 1:10:27.602
You really think
that's gonna work?

1:10:33.142 --> 1:10:34.844
Jessie!

1:10:34.877 --> 1:10:36.212
Oh, my God.

1:10:36.245 --> 1:10:38.114
Oh. Wow.

1:10:38.147 --> 1:10:39.581
Emily.

1:10:39.614 --> 1:10:41.217
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

1:10:41.250 --> 1:10:42.718
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1:10:42.752 --> 1:10:44.687
Um, you need
to go get Christopher.

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:46.088
They took him
and some other kids.

1:10:46.122 --> 1:10:47.555
They're gonna send 'em
away somewhere.

1:10:47.589 --> 1:10:49.025
- Where are they?
- Down the corridor.

1:10:49.058 --> 1:10:50.625
Okay. Take care of these guys.

1:10:51.660 --> 1:10:53.162
Emily, wait!

1:10:59.634 --> 1:11:00.770
Proceed forward.

1:11:00.803 --> 1:11:02.537
No.

1:11:02.570 --> 1:11:04.073
No. No.

1:11:04.974 --> 1:11:06.943
No. No. No.

1:11:10.947 --> 1:11:12.580
- Proceed forward.
- Here's the thing.

1:11:12.614 --> 1:11:14.216
I'm not really ready for this,

1:11:14.250 --> 1:11:16.953
so if you could just me go?
Please just let me go? No.

1:11:16.986 --> 1:11:18.486
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:20.156
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Let him go!

1:11:24.626 --> 1:11:27.029
I know it's hard to see
with those black eyes of yours,

1:11:27.063 --> 1:11:29.198
but my finger is literally
on the light switch.

1:11:29.231 --> 1:11:31.934
You think you'll get out alive?

1:11:31.968 --> 1:11:33.235
Let him go.

1:11:48.751 --> 1:11:51.053
We're gonna get out of here.

1:12:15.044 --> 1:12:16.278
Emily.

1:12:20.683 --> 1:12:22.084
Rachel?

1:12:22.118 --> 1:12:23.853
It wasn't your fault.

1:12:23.886 --> 1:12:26.088
Emily, you didn't
do anything wrong.

1:12:26.122 --> 1:12:29.091
I slipped off the roof.
It was an accident.

1:12:29.125 --> 1:12:30.960
But I'm okay.

1:12:30.993 --> 1:12:32.128
I'm alive.

1:12:36.132 --> 1:12:38.334
Take my hand, Emily,

1:12:38.367 --> 1:12:41.737
so we can play together
just like we used to.

1:13:05.261 --> 1:13:08.697
So we meet again.

1:13:08.731 --> 1:13:10.933
Had a feeling we would.

1:13:13.903 --> 1:13:18.107
I have the suspicion you know
what I am going to ask you.

1:13:19.141 --> 1:13:21.710
So will you?

1:13:24.747 --> 1:13:26.015
Will you let us in?

1:13:31.153 --> 1:13:35.958
I suggest you make this
simple for both of us.

1:13:35.991 --> 1:13:39.128
Will you let us in?

1:13:50.973 --> 1:13:52.074
Hell no.

1:13:55.077 --> 1:13:57.012
Run, Emily!

1:13:57.046 --> 1:13:58.914
Em, back of you!

1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:32.181
Get out!

1:14:54.003 --> 1:14:55.704
Thought I lost you.

1:14:55.738 --> 1:14:58.240
It's okay. I'm right here.

1:15:00.142 --> 1:15:01.844
I'm right here.

1:15:11.820 --> 1:15:13.322
Oh, did you
bring your retainers?

1:15:13.355 --> 1:15:15.024
Yes, Mom.

1:15:15.057 --> 1:15:16.759
Okay, I think we
double-checked everything

1:15:16.792 --> 1:15:18.194
at least four times.

1:15:18.227 --> 1:15:19.495
May I take your bag, ma'am?

1:15:19.528 --> 1:15:20.930
- Thank you, sir.
- You're right. Sorry.

1:15:20.963 --> 1:15:22.097
How 'bout the slippers?

1:15:22.131 --> 1:15:23.966
- Got those?
- Yep.

1:15:23.999 --> 1:15:25.401
I don't think
I slept a minute last night.

1:15:25.434 --> 1:15:26.835
- Me, too.
- Listen...

1:15:26.869 --> 1:15:28.137
about the crush thing...

1:15:28.170 --> 1:15:30.039
Drop it.

1:15:30.072 --> 1:15:32.441
But for the record,
if I was ten,

1:15:32.474 --> 1:15:34.810
- I'd totally date you.
- Really?

1:15:34.843 --> 1:15:36.412
So there's hope.

1:15:36.445 --> 1:15:38.981
I mean, "if you were able
to go back in time" type hope.

1:15:39.014 --> 1:15:40.382
How dopey.

1:15:41.884 --> 1:15:43.485
Next project, time machine.

1:15:47.056 --> 1:15:48.023
Em.

1:15:48.424 --> 1:15:50.426
I love you.
I'm so proud of you.

1:15:52.394 --> 1:15:54.463
Cape Canaveral,
that's pretty rad.

1:15:54.496 --> 1:15:56.365
Wow, Dad.
Didn't know you were so hip.

1:15:56.398 --> 1:15:59.101
Nah, your dad's still got
some teenager left in him.

1:16:00.102 --> 1:16:02.004
Oh, God, Dad. That's so creepy.

1:16:03.539 --> 1:16:05.207
Jessie!

1:16:07.943 --> 1:16:09.378
What's this?

1:16:09.411 --> 1:16:10.346
They're yours now.

1:16:10.379 --> 1:16:11.213
They're brand-new.

1:16:11.247 --> 1:16:13.082
Aww. Thank you so much.

1:16:14.083 --> 1:16:14.950
Have so much fun.

1:16:14.984 --> 1:16:16.285
And if he annoys,
you just flick his nose.

1:16:16.318 --> 1:16:17.953
Not funny.

1:16:19.321 --> 1:16:20.889
All right, you two.

1:16:22.057 --> 1:16:23.025
NASA's waiting.

1:16:26.262 --> 1:16:28.063
All right, here we go.

1:16:54.890 --> 1:16:57.426
God, are they having, like,
a marathon today or something?

1:17:01.864 --> 1:17:03.532
Holy sweetness.

1:17:03.565 --> 1:17:04.833
This is for us!

1:17:04.867 --> 1:17:06.969
Oh, my God, this is insane!

1:17:07.002 --> 1:17:08.504
I'm so shook right now.

1:17:09.505 --> 1:17:11.407
There's Principal Malinsky.

1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:13.575
Guess this is what happens
when you're local heroes.

1:17:15.244 --> 1:17:16.578
Look!
There's Mrs. Barnett!

1:17:17.479 --> 1:17:19.148
And Dr. Bauer!

1:17:21.216 --> 1:17:23.218
Did she just blow you a kiss?
