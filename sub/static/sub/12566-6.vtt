- Previously, on <i> Royal Pains...</i>
- What do you mean,

00:02.072 --> 00:03.191
there's nothing you can do?

00:03.191 --> 00:06.192
You're the bank. What
about the 72-hour hold?

00:07.872 --> 00:09.971
It's a 24-hour hold?

00:09.971 --> 00:11.946
[glass shatters]

00:11.946 --> 00:14.184
Jeremiah came to see me a few days ago.

00:14.184 --> 00:15.959
He was quite distraught.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.659
Maybe he's at his house out here.

00:17.659 --> 00:21.206
The house is empty, and it's up for sale.

00:21.206 --> 00:23.028
So I have a headache. Big deal.

00:23.217 --> 00:24.996
Let me see this.

00:25.599 --> 00:27.549
This isn't because of my hep C, is it?

00:27.549 --> 00:28.904

00:37.235 --> 00:39.150
(Boris) Don't touch that.

00:39.190 --> 00:43.216
This certainly... complicates things.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.763
Mr. Lawson.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.975
For many weeks now, it's been imperative

00:53.975 --> 00:56.002
that this operating theater

00:56.002 --> 00:58.257
and the surgical procedure
for which it was built

00:58.257 --> 00:59.861
be kept secret.

01:00.879 --> 01:03.700
Well... your secret's safe with me.

01:05.141 --> 01:07.048
'Cause I don't know it.

01:07.673 --> 01:10.758
Only two people in the world
have known of this surgery...

01:11.169 --> 01:12.802
until now.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.031
Well, maybe now's a good
time to stop telling me

01:15.031 --> 01:16.165
things I don't need to know.

01:16.165 --> 01:18.839
Evan, that possibility disappeared

01:18.839 --> 01:20.794
the moment you broke in here.

01:20.844 --> 01:23.347
You have no idea how sorry I am about that.

01:23.385 --> 01:24.695
The patient we're expecting,

01:24.744 --> 01:26.331
his health is crucial to the survival

01:26.331 --> 01:27.888
of an entire culture.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.128
If it becomes known that he is ill,

01:30.128 --> 01:31.737
it would be catastrophic.

01:31.737 --> 01:34.254
I promise you I'll keep my mouth shut.

01:35.046 --> 01:37.117
[beeping]

01:38.386 --> 01:40.387
[beeping continues]

01:41.255 --> 01:42.529
Do you need to get that?

01:42.564 --> 01:43.848
[beeping]

01:46.678 --> 01:48.539
Come with me.

01:52.939 --> 01:54.996
No one at the lab has seen
Jeremiah since yesterday.

01:54.996 --> 01:56.055
No one at the hospital, either.

01:56.055 --> 01:57.866
- Did you get a hold of Bob?
- Yes.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.633
He said it wouldn't be
appropriate to give me

01:59.633 --> 02:02.296
any information on Jeremiah's therapy.

02:02.570 --> 02:04.159
He puts his house on the market,

02:04.195 --> 02:05.987
abruptly cancels his appointments.

02:05.987 --> 02:08.062
In the past when bad things
have happened to Jeremiah,

02:08.062 --> 02:09.531
he's disappeared into his work,

02:09.531 --> 02:11.197
like when he ran away to Iceland.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.418
Do you think he went back?

02:12.418 --> 02:14.504
I really hope not. Any luck reaching Evan?

02:14.504 --> 02:15.713
I keep getting his voice mail.

02:15.713 --> 02:18.227
Me too. Shall we call the police?

02:18.268 --> 02:20.013
If we can't get in touch with Jeremiah

02:20.013 --> 02:22.614
and we don't hear from Evan by the morning,

02:23.238 --> 02:25.456
we call the police.

02:31.327 --> 02:33.394
As I have received an
aborted call minutes ago,

02:33.394 --> 02:36.140
I am concerned there's been a
security breach on your end.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.222
There's been no breach
here, I can assure you.

02:38.579 --> 02:41.064
There has, however, been chatter

02:41.064 --> 02:43.711
over various channels about my
presence here in the Hamptons.

02:43.711 --> 02:48.465
That is why I have installed my
security expert, Mr. Lawson.

02:49.023 --> 02:51.084
- Installed him?
- Yes.

02:51.084 --> 02:53.671
Mr. Lawson is undercover
as the administrator

02:53.671 --> 02:55.030
of the hospital now.

02:55.030 --> 02:57.088
I think it best that I exit the country

02:57.088 --> 02:59.763
and take with me our adversaries' attention.

02:59.808 --> 03:01.953
In my absence, Mr. Lawson will step in.

03:01.953 --> 03:03.204
Perhaps we should delay.

03:03.204 --> 03:05.027
That's not an option, and you know it.

03:05.327 --> 03:06.707
The surgery can no longer wait.

03:06.707 --> 03:10.561
[both speaking Mandarin]

03:18.269 --> 03:20.086
He doesn't seem to trust you very much.

03:20.086 --> 03:21.429
The feeling is mutual.

03:21.476 --> 03:23.903
I hope, Evan, you are prepared.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.419
Prepared for what?

03:25.419 --> 03:28.015
That is what we have to figure out.

03:28.054 --> 03:30.562
Call your wife and tell her
you're not coming home.

03:31.401 --> 03:32.987
Ever?

03:36.577 --> 03:38.689
Hi, Jeremiah. It's me again.

03:38.730 --> 03:40.637
I-I know that I keep leaving messages,

03:40.637 --> 03:43.001
but I am worried about you.

03:43.001 --> 03:45.538
I understand if you need your space,

03:45.538 --> 03:48.004
but I wish you'd let me
know that you're okay.

03:48.050 --> 03:49.537
[baby cries over monitor]

03:49.537 --> 03:53.275
There goes Sashi. Can you hear her?

03:54.435 --> 03:57.297
She misses you too, especially at this hour.

03:57.329 --> 03:59.581
I mean, you two were always the night owls.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.519
Jeremiah.

04:24.863 --> 04:26.522
Yes.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.819
I'm so glad to see that you're okay.

04:28.859 --> 04:30.994
We've been very worried about you.

04:40.135 --> 04:41.487
So you've been sleeping there during the day

04:41.527 --> 04:43.585
and working out here when
everyone's away at night, huh?

04:43.585 --> 04:44.921
Mm-hmm.

04:49.627 --> 04:52.613
I had no idea that you were
already working on mice models.

04:52.653 --> 04:54.984
Your research has progressed so quickly.

04:54.984 --> 04:56.188
I'm very busy.

04:56.188 --> 04:58.467
Yes, I completely understand.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.956
- Maybe I can help.
- Uh, you can't.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.235
Go away, please.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.527

05:22.452 --> 05:23.988
Wow.

05:23.998 --> 05:26.305
I haven't pulled an
all-nighter since college.

05:26.305 --> 05:27.962
Remember those days?

05:27.976 --> 05:31.185
Pulling on your earlobes to
stay awake, crushing No-Doz

05:31.185 --> 05:32.402
and putting it in your coffee,

05:32.402 --> 05:34.665
and then chasing your coffee with Red Bull?

05:34.665 --> 05:37.982
Although in your day,
it was probably... Tab.

05:38.003 --> 05:40.654
- You're clear on the plan?
- Yes.

05:40.654 --> 05:42.264
I will go to Brazil.

05:42.264 --> 05:43.853
Straight from here.

05:43.853 --> 05:45.296
Yeah, and you will not...

05:45.296 --> 05:46.908
Contact you once you're gone.

05:46.908 --> 05:47.843
This is great, this is good.

05:47.843 --> 05:49.475
Keep testing me.

05:49.506 --> 05:50.837
I'm not testing you.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.119
You keep interrupting me.

05:52.154 --> 05:54.130
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

05:54.164 --> 05:57.021
- I'm a little nervous.
- [sighs] It's all right.

05:57.038 --> 05:58.742
You've done quite well.

06:01.104 --> 06:02.742
Until that moment.

06:02.742 --> 06:04.374
Your car keys, Evan.

06:04.374 --> 06:06.053
Oh, right.

06:06.053 --> 06:08.148
Just so you know, I
switched cars with Paige,

06:08.188 --> 06:11.017
so it will be her car
you're borrowing, not mine.

06:12.728 --> 06:14.284
Then thank Paige for me.

06:14.284 --> 06:15.931
Yeah, I'll... I can't.

06:15.931 --> 06:17.779
She doesn't know about the plan.

06:19.418 --> 06:21.851
That was a test, wasn't
it? Just one question.

06:21.851 --> 06:23.855
When the mystery VIP arrives,
should I not look at him,

06:23.855 --> 06:25.379
just so I can't ID him?

06:25.379 --> 06:26.556
Not that I would even recognize him.

06:26.556 --> 06:28.046
I'm not really up on my world leaders

06:28.046 --> 06:31.577
or titans of industry or ruthless dictators.

06:32.064 --> 06:33.797
Not that you hang out
with ruthless dictators.

06:33.837 --> 06:35.918
You know what I mean,
I'm just... I'm just...

06:35.918 --> 06:37.471
Oh, here you are.

06:37.509 --> 06:38.979
Did you lose your phone?

06:38.979 --> 06:41.100
No, no. Just had a long night.

06:42.274 --> 06:45.146
The two of you have been here all night?

06:45.146 --> 06:47.315
Just a long night of asset tracking.

06:47.315 --> 06:48.329
You know, apparently the hospital

06:48.329 --> 06:50.930
has a lot of assets that need tracking.

06:50.930 --> 06:53.135
- Good morning, Hank.
- Good morning, Boris.

06:53.135 --> 06:55.906
And good-bye, gentlemen.

06:57.019 --> 06:58.508
Good-bye.

06:59.124 --> 07:00.475
[groans]

07:03.129 --> 07:05.881
- What was that?
- What?

07:05.881 --> 07:08.172
You and Boris have lots of slumber parties?

07:09.289 --> 07:10.440
Why are you here?

07:10.440 --> 07:11.953
Because you wouldn't answer your phone.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.423
Jeremiah disappeared, and...

07:13.423 --> 07:14.526
What do you mean, disappeared?

07:14.526 --> 07:16.604
- When?
- He's okay. Divya found him.

07:16.618 --> 07:18.494
He was very upset about a financial mistake

07:18.494 --> 07:20.098
he made at the lab.

07:20.886 --> 07:22.739
Now, Divya thinks he
needs a little more time

07:22.739 --> 07:24.307
before we reach out to him.

07:24.307 --> 07:26.174
She'll let us know when he's ready.

07:26.174 --> 07:27.535
All right.

07:29.065 --> 07:30.947
You sure you're okay?

07:30.947 --> 07:32.778
Yeah. Yeah, long night.

07:32.778 --> 07:34.110
All good. Just a whole lot of...

07:34.110 --> 07:35.882
Asset tracking?

07:42.978 --> 07:44.803
[doorbell rings]

07:45.417 --> 07:47.504
Divya, hi.

07:47.504 --> 07:49.948
Come on in. I'm Mimi Harper.

07:49.948 --> 07:51.526
Nice to meet you.

07:55.271 --> 07:57.527
Let me just grab these.

07:57.550 --> 08:00.012
So is she part of the hostilities?

08:00.057 --> 08:01.696
No, Dad. This is Divya.

08:01.696 --> 08:04.349
She works for a concierge medical practice.

08:04.349 --> 08:05.615
Uncle Jim isn't feeling well.

08:05.649 --> 08:07.705
I thought maybe his hepatitis was back.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.489
Or maybe he just has a cold,

08:10.519 --> 08:13.790
which he deserves for insisting on sleeping

08:13.790 --> 08:15.253
out in my yard.

08:15.253 --> 08:17.533
Well, it's better to be safe.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.920
- Sorry about that.
- Not a problem.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.690
Sounds like I should take
a look at your uncle.

08:23.690 --> 08:25.609
Please. But first, you need to

08:25.609 --> 08:27.553
put on the apron or this.

08:27.553 --> 08:29.066
What's that?

08:29.572 --> 08:31.756
A...capelet.

08:36.407 --> 08:37.938
Dad's not usually like that.

08:37.961 --> 08:41.053
It's just he and Uncle Jim don't
like each other very much.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.716
- Are they brothers?
- Yeah, like Cain and Abel.

08:43.716 --> 08:45.529
My father used to worship Uncle Jim,

08:45.529 --> 08:47.825
and now they barely talk to one another.

08:48.219 --> 08:49.576
Are you the intermediary?

08:49.599 --> 08:50.981
Not for much longer.

08:50.981 --> 08:53.385
I'm leaving the country in
a few weeks for a new job.

08:53.385 --> 08:55.095
I was hoping to broker a truce before then,

08:55.095 --> 08:57.945
but peace in the Middle
East seems more likely.

08:57.945 --> 08:59.160
(Jim) Now is the time.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.189
We have suffered enough embarrassments

09:01.189 --> 09:03.674
at the hands of our Confederate enemy.

09:03.697 --> 09:06.449
These are our three days of rest

09:06.449 --> 09:10.347
before we venture off
to engage in hostilities.

09:10.570 --> 09:14.448
It will be a cavalry operation
on a scale so grand,

09:14.448 --> 09:16.023
nothing like it has been attempted

09:16.023 --> 09:17.303
in the Eastern Theater.

09:17.336 --> 09:19.390
- Are you with me?
- (all) Yeah.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.429
Jim? Is that you?

09:22.429 --> 09:24.724
Out here, it's Captain James Harper.

09:24.724 --> 09:26.588
You know my uncle?

09:27.243 --> 09:30.586
Yes, Jim was one of
HankMed's first patients,

09:30.586 --> 09:33.459
but I've never seen him off his boat.

09:34.183 --> 09:37.638
Captain, when you're done,
may I speak with the fisherman?

09:38.684 --> 09:40.546
Ten minutes R and R.

09:41.215 --> 09:42.910
[indistinct chatter]

09:42.910 --> 09:44.053
Let me know if you need anything,

09:44.053 --> 09:46.625
but I got to get back to the 21st century.

09:47.747 --> 09:50.536
Divya. Good to see you.

09:50.536 --> 09:51.734
You too.

09:51.734 --> 09:53.890
- That is quite a horse.
- Yeah.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.955
I had no idea that you
were a Civil War reenactor.

09:55.955 --> 09:57.580
Well, it's a passion of mine.

09:57.655 --> 09:59.384
My family took part in the real thing,

09:59.384 --> 10:02.147
and some of us give a damn about history,

10:02.147 --> 10:03.556
unlike my brother.

10:03.556 --> 10:05.358
- May I?
- Oh.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.901
See that house?

10:11.122 --> 10:12.559
It's beautiful. I was just in it.

10:12.559 --> 10:15.723
Good thing, 'cause it
won't be there for long.

10:15.938 --> 10:18.769
Ed, my idiot little brother,

10:18.769 --> 10:20.110
plans on knocking it down

10:20.110 --> 10:22.384
to build one of those McMansions.

10:22.604 --> 10:24.806
How can your brother do that
if you both own the land?

10:24.806 --> 10:26.160
Owned.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.424
I couldn't afford
splitting the property tax.

10:28.424 --> 10:30.455
Recession wiped out my savings.

10:30.645 --> 10:32.360
So you think he helped me?

10:32.631 --> 10:33.650
No?

10:33.650 --> 10:36.136
Damn right, no. Bought me out.

10:36.159 --> 10:38.048
You know, we used to be best buddies.

10:38.048 --> 10:40.526
Ha. Then his hedge fund
takes off and suddenly

10:40.526 --> 10:43.216
I'm just a cranky old fisherman.

10:43.216 --> 10:45.708
I'm sorry to hear that. Open up.

10:49.242 --> 10:53.334
Well... who cares? I'm past it.

10:54.311 --> 10:56.373
Son of a bitch forbids me to be

10:56.400 --> 10:59.257
on his property except for these three days,

10:59.257 --> 11:00.745
when we commemorate our ancestors

11:00.760 --> 11:02.466
who mustered to march on Fredericksburg

11:02.480 --> 11:04.375
on this very spot.

11:04.408 --> 11:06.670
Maybe you both need a little time.

11:07.984 --> 11:09.827
It's been seven years.

11:10.617 --> 11:12.239
That ship has sailed.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.583
Jim, you do have a fever.

11:14.625 --> 11:15.980
You think it's my hepatitis?

11:15.980 --> 11:18.288
I'd like to take some blood to find out.

11:18.288 --> 11:21.267
In the meantime, I'd like
to prescribe some ibuprofen.

11:21.435 --> 11:23.231
Ibuprofen?

11:23.269 --> 11:24.822
Never heard of it.

11:24.822 --> 11:27.119
You must mean willow bark.

11:27.970 --> 11:29.384
Ah.

11:29.914 --> 11:31.620
Carry on.

11:38.483 --> 11:40.765
Hey, Ken, everything okay?
You sounded pretty rough.

11:40.790 --> 11:42.332
- Come here.
- What?

11:42.332 --> 11:43.461
- Get over here.
- Okay.

11:43.461 --> 11:44.935
My stomach's been a little topsy-turvy,

11:44.935 --> 11:46.529
but that's not why I called.

11:46.565 --> 11:48.430
Okay. Why don't you get out,

11:48.467 --> 11:50.028
and you can tell me why you did call?

11:50.063 --> 11:51.251
[whispers] Not gonna happen.

11:51.251 --> 11:54.053
Why not? And why are we whispering?

11:54.398 --> 11:55.393
[beep]

11:58.821 --> 12:00.670
- Oh, boy.
- It's worse than you think.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.191
- I'm not sure that's possible.
- Stop.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.010
Look, I have this new girlfriend, Helen.

12:04.010 --> 12:06.221
- She's amazing.
- I can tell.

12:06.265 --> 12:07.830
Does Helen not believe in bathing suits?

12:07.830 --> 12:10.295
She lives a completely
natural and honest existence,

12:10.337 --> 12:12.334
and now I do too, but if she comes out here,

12:12.334 --> 12:14.283
you have to pretend that
you're here as my friend.

12:14.283 --> 12:16.125
Huh. Sounds like you've changed a lot.

12:16.125 --> 12:16.974
[sniffing]

12:16.974 --> 12:18.299
Why do you smell like watermelon?

12:18.336 --> 12:20.155
- Oh, that's Helen's incense.
- Oh.

12:20.155 --> 12:21.628
It really helps us stay mindful.

12:21.628 --> 12:23.311
So why am I here?

12:23.311 --> 12:25.008
I took a Viagra a few hours ago...

12:25.008 --> 12:26.446
not that I need it, obviously.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.546
- Right.
- But I've been having

12:27.546 --> 12:29.205
these butterflies in my stomach.

12:29.205 --> 12:31.148
It's because I really
care about her, I guess,

12:31.148 --> 12:32.733
and they take me right out of the mood.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.533
So the pill worked like magic.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.552
- And I did too.
- Yeah, of course.

12:36.552 --> 12:38.352
But now, the magic's over,

12:38.352 --> 12:40.107
and I'm still...

12:40.340 --> 12:43.426
Magical... and you don't want
Helen to know you took a pill.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.160
All right, I'll give you
some pseudoephedrine.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.369
Helen doesn't believe in meds.

12:46.369 --> 12:48.041
I can aspirate with a needle.

12:48.052 --> 12:49.396
- I'll take the pill.
- Good call.

12:49.407 --> 12:50.736
[gate hinges squeaking]

12:50.804 --> 12:53.186
- Oh, get the... get the...
- Oh, oh, okay.

12:53.186 --> 12:54.343
Hurry up! Turn it on! [beep]

12:54.343 --> 12:56.445
Come on, Lawson, go!
[water resumes bubbling]

12:57.577 --> 12:59.830
Honey, I want you to meet

12:59.830 --> 13:02.316
my very dear friend, Hank Lawson.

13:02.316 --> 13:04.583
I wouldn't say dear friend.
We... we're friends, you know?

13:04.598 --> 13:05.805
- Hi.
- Oh, Ben has told me

13:05.805 --> 13:07.131
so much about you.

13:07.131 --> 13:08.673
- Ah...
- Single, doctor,

13:08.673 --> 13:11.133
- really good guy.
- Well, thank you.

13:12.905 --> 13:14.707
[inhales]

13:15.454 --> 13:17.564
Oh, I don't usually do this,

13:17.564 --> 13:19.618
but do you mind?

13:19.634 --> 13:21.836
Uh, No. Go... go ahead.

13:23.816 --> 13:25.396
Mm-hmm.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.793
Hmm...

13:28.924 --> 13:30.670
[inhales]

13:31.719 --> 13:32.838
Oh...

13:32.838 --> 13:34.317
- Oh, Hank!
- Ah!

13:34.340 --> 13:37.031
I'm getting a really positive
energy from you right now.

13:37.071 --> 13:39.053
I am really surprised to hear that.

13:39.101 --> 13:40.618
My sister Grace is in town for the weekend.

13:40.618 --> 13:42.485
She just got out of this
train wreck of a relationship

13:42.485 --> 13:44.409
- and is kind of a hot mess.
- Huh.

13:44.409 --> 13:46.678
She could really use some positive energy.

13:46.707 --> 13:48.744
Why don't you join us for dinner?

13:48.744 --> 13:50.239
- Double date! I love it!
- Yeah.

13:50.239 --> 13:51.816
As fun as that sounds, I'm...

13:51.816 --> 13:53.489
I got a busy schedule, so...

13:53.489 --> 13:54.642
Oh, too bad.

13:54.642 --> 13:55.847
Maybe another time.

13:55.847 --> 13:58.262
Uh... yeah, yeah.

13:58.744 --> 13:59.933
Come.

13:59.933 --> 14:01.683
We don't want to be late for hot yoga.

14:01.683 --> 14:03.041
It might get cold.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.463
[laughs]

14:04.613 --> 14:05.602
Yoga humor.

14:05.602 --> 14:07.410
Right, yeah. Good stuff.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.443
I think we should replace them.

14:12.443 --> 14:13.904
Replace the rings and the clips.

14:13.904 --> 14:15.667
Okay? Thanks a lot, Jake.

14:15.667 --> 14:20.299
Well, Lawson, you're really doing it.

14:20.299 --> 14:21.438
Yeah.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.337
Doing what?

14:23.337 --> 14:24.893
Closing down area one.

14:24.893 --> 14:27.173
Yes, I am. I am doing that for one day.

14:27.173 --> 14:29.130
Do you know who parks in area one?

14:29.590 --> 14:31.353
Hospital employees.

14:31.434 --> 14:34.445
Surgeons who will not
appreciate remote parking,

14:34.445 --> 14:36.545
- even for a day.
- Wait. The surgeons park here?

14:36.545 --> 14:38.758
Yep, and when you piss off the surgeons,

14:38.758 --> 14:41.003
you piss off the patients
about to have surgery.

14:41.434 --> 14:43.742
Five years ago, Dr.
MacDonald had food poisoning

14:43.742 --> 14:46.343
after eating some bad Mexican
food in the cafeteria,

14:46.343 --> 14:48.769
so he canceled Ms. Newberg's tummy tuck.

14:48.781 --> 14:52.315
Suddenly, the whole community
was calling us a taco stand.

14:55.121 --> 14:56.888
Hold on a sec.

14:56.910 --> 14:58.316
That actually happened?

14:58.316 --> 15:00.093
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

15:00.093 --> 15:02.285
Me? I'd close it on the weekend.

15:02.285 --> 15:03.617
Well, I can't. I mean, this is...

15:03.617 --> 15:05.643
Taco stand.

15:10.927 --> 15:14.313
♪♪

15:16.863 --> 15:19.189
I'm sorry for calling you back here so soon.

15:19.189 --> 15:21.020
When an entire regiment
comes down with a fever,

15:21.020 --> 15:22.980
I'd say that calls for medical attention.

15:22.980 --> 15:24.838
Mimi's not in the regiment.

15:24.852 --> 15:26.440
I'm the go-between.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.029
Hmm, and 101 temperature is your reward.

15:30.284 --> 15:34.875
Has anyone else experienced any
symptoms other than a fever?

15:37.736 --> 15:39.402
I am a little itchy.

15:39.435 --> 15:40.386
Me too.

15:40.421 --> 15:42.536
Yeah, up and down my arms.

15:42.536 --> 15:44.356
It's from the blankets.

15:44.356 --> 15:46.858
I found some vintage wool
blankets in the cellar.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.193
They've been in the family for generations.

15:49.193 --> 15:52.276
Our predecessors had to
contend with real problems

15:52.312 --> 15:55.171
like dysentery and typhoid fever,

15:55.171 --> 15:57.325
scurvy, smallpox.

15:57.795 --> 16:00.120
A little itching is not gonna kill us.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.020
Right?

16:01.020 --> 16:02.896
I think that Jim...

16:02.896 --> 16:06.486
Captain Harper is right.

16:06.486 --> 16:07.496
It would be another thing

16:07.496 --> 16:10.245
if anyone is delirious or passing blood

16:10.245 --> 16:12.414
or has fluid-filled vesicles.

16:13.064 --> 16:14.986
Fluid-filled vesicles?

16:14.986 --> 16:17.116
Sorry. An odd, blistering rash.

16:17.962 --> 16:20.899
Uh... what would that be a symptom of?

16:20.899 --> 16:22.563
Smallpox.

16:30.011 --> 16:32.429
Does anyone else have a
rash that looks like that?

16:32.429 --> 16:33.820
I do.

16:37.272 --> 16:40.300
I thought smallpox was eradicated.

16:40.330 --> 16:43.926
Contained, technically, but
it could survive on a blanket

16:43.926 --> 16:45.810
under the right humidity and temperature.

16:45.810 --> 16:47.223
You think we have smallpox?

16:47.223 --> 16:48.689
It's highly unlikely,

16:48.689 --> 16:51.841
but just in case, let me take some swabs.

16:51.841 --> 16:54.442
And in the meantime, you
should delay the march

16:54.442 --> 16:57.472
to Fredericksburg until
I can get some answers.

16:59.638 --> 17:02.563
[snoring]

17:06.796 --> 17:08.602
Ah... not in the face!

17:11.790 --> 17:13.497
Never better. Why?

17:13.529 --> 17:14.932
Maybe because I didn't ask how you are.

17:14.932 --> 17:16.592
You thought you were about
to get smacked in the face.

17:16.592 --> 17:18.729
And whatever it is you've
got going on with Boris...

17:18.729 --> 17:21.377
I don't have anything going
on with Boris, all right?

17:21.377 --> 17:23.189
Of course, if I did, that's
what I'd have to tell you.

17:23.189 --> 17:24.526
- You know the drill.
- Yeah, I do know the drill,

17:24.526 --> 17:25.957
and that's why I'm worried.

17:26.268 --> 17:27.611
Ahh.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.696
Boris functions on a different level,

17:29.718 --> 17:32.225
so it can sometimes be
hard to see all the angles.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.043
Functions, angles... what is this, algebra?

17:34.043 --> 17:35.748
I think you mean trigonometry.

17:35.748 --> 17:36.760
- That's the same thing.
- No.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.545
They're not the same thing.

17:37.545 --> 17:40.112
Algebra is... okay, okay. Look...

17:40.625 --> 17:43.003
Boris deals with dangerous people.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.987
I don't want to see you in danger.

17:44.987 --> 17:47.726
So it's okay for you but not for me?

17:47.726 --> 17:49.190
I never tried to put myself in danger.

17:49.190 --> 17:50.948
- I tried to stay out of it.
- I think you just don't like

17:50.948 --> 17:53.140
the fact that the Boris shoe's
on the other foot now,

17:53.140 --> 17:54.113
if there is a Boris shoe,

17:54.137 --> 17:55.500
which I can neither confirm nor deny.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.540
- Evan...
- Hank I appreciate the concern,

17:57.540 --> 17:58.633
but you have to stop worrying.

17:58.633 --> 18:00.473
There's nothing going on
except for a whole bunch

18:00.473 --> 18:03.573
of interim administrating, which
has me interim exhausted.

18:03.573 --> 18:05.686
Okay, okay.

18:05.744 --> 18:09.089
Just please... be careful.

18:09.869 --> 18:12.591
If there were something going on,

18:12.591 --> 18:15.358
don't you think I'd be on a
private jet to Brazil right now?

18:15.358 --> 18:18.058
- Why would I think that?
- Because that's where Boris is.

18:19.454 --> 18:21.415
Hypothetically.

18:36.769 --> 18:39.759
Ken? Why are you in my hot tub?

18:39.797 --> 18:41.451
I wanted to talk.

18:41.902 --> 18:43.325
Wait a second.

18:43.712 --> 18:45.498
Are you...

18:45.527 --> 18:46.399
I thought it'd be impolite

18:46.399 --> 18:47.738
to borrow one of your bathing suits.

18:47.738 --> 18:49.275
No. This is much better.

18:49.275 --> 18:50.812
How are you feeling?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.640
Primo. Goes up, goes down...

18:53.640 --> 18:54.807
I'm like a human elevator.

18:54.807 --> 18:56.007
Wish I hadn't asked.

18:56.007 --> 18:57.215
But then after Helen and I went to bed,

18:57.215 --> 18:58.668
my stomach started acting up again.

18:58.668 --> 19:00.777
I haven't been able to
keep anything down all day.

19:00.777 --> 19:02.669
Okay. And now?

19:02.700 --> 19:05.440
Much better. This hot tub
makes a big difference.

19:05.482 --> 19:06.794
All right.

19:06.835 --> 19:08.220
Let me take a look at you.

19:08.779 --> 19:12.001
But first, I'm gonna do us
both a favor and turn around.

19:12.783 --> 19:14.209
There you go.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.138
Yep. You're dehydrated.

19:18.138 --> 19:20.128
You need to get more
fluids and maybe dial back

19:20.128 --> 19:22.103
on the dietary restrictions for a while.

19:22.103 --> 19:24.397
In the meantime, I'm also gonna
give you some antiemetics.

19:24.447 --> 19:26.512
Anything. I can't miss
any more time with Helen

19:26.548 --> 19:27.577
because I'm sick.

19:27.577 --> 19:28.511
I know I've said this before,

19:28.511 --> 19:30.790
but this time, it's really true.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.742
I think she's the one.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.370
Which is great for you.

19:34.370 --> 19:37.282
One less stud bachelor in the
Hamptons to compete with.

19:37.282 --> 19:39.360
Being a stud bachelor isn't really my thing,

19:39.360 --> 19:40.730
- but thank you.
- That's true.

19:40.730 --> 19:43.088
So what is your thing?

19:43.405 --> 19:45.678
My thing is the simple things.

19:45.678 --> 19:48.488
Meet someone, fall in love,

19:48.488 --> 19:51.039
get married, buy a house,

19:51.073 --> 19:52.955
and have kids.

19:52.993 --> 19:54.315
So get in the game, Lawson.

19:54.315 --> 19:55.410
Believe me. I'm trying.

19:55.410 --> 19:56.967
- Not hard enough.
- How would you know?

19:56.967 --> 19:58.736
For starters, you're still single.

19:58.736 --> 20:00.578
I mean, you are a semi-attractive,

20:00.578 --> 20:01.629
successful doctor.

20:01.629 --> 20:03.947
- How hard can it be?
- Gee, thanks, Ken.

20:03.947 --> 20:06.558
Helen offers to set you up with her sister,

20:06.558 --> 20:09.050
and you shut it down before she
can even finish the invitation.

20:09.050 --> 20:10.327
Look, I don't think meeting a hot mess

20:10.327 --> 20:12.111
is a good idea for either me or her.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.020
Yeah, Miss Right is just gonna cruise on up

20:14.020 --> 20:15.344
when she's good and ready.

20:15.344 --> 20:18.124
Hank, you want to be single.

20:18.124 --> 20:20.464
I know the type. I was the type.

20:20.464 --> 20:22.154
We're a lot alike.

20:22.195 --> 20:24.150
At least, we were. Now
I'm in love, and you're...

20:24.150 --> 20:25.230
Okay, okay. Fine. You know what?

20:25.230 --> 20:27.295
Please, tell Helen I
would love to have dinner

20:27.295 --> 20:29.552
with her emotionally unstable sister.

20:29.589 --> 20:31.265
Well, now we're making progress.

20:31.265 --> 20:32.704
Okay. Put that down.

20:34.743 --> 20:36.596
[phone vibrates]

20:39.808 --> 20:42.394
- Hello?
- There's been a change.

20:42.394 --> 20:45.126
The delivery will now occur
night after tomorrow.

20:45.126 --> 20:49.015
Oh, I already shut down parking
area one for tonight, though,

20:49.015 --> 20:50.511
and if I do that too many
nights in a row, the...

20:50.511 --> 20:53.153
Plans change, Mr. Lawson. Please adapt.

20:53.153 --> 20:55.938
The package will be there night
after tomorrow at midnight.

20:55.938 --> 20:57.583
You will arrive 30 minutes in advance.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.559
You will be alone. Do you understand?

20:59.559 --> 21:01.599
- I do.
- Very good.

21:01.599 --> 21:03.428
In the interest of security,

21:03.428 --> 21:04.590
this will be our last communication

21:04.590 --> 21:07.405
until you've successfully taken
possession of the delivery.

21:07.405 --> 21:08.927
Okay, and don't worry, Boris.

21:08.927 --> 21:11.360
No one will be able to
link anything back to you.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.748
Of that I have no doubt.

21:12.786 --> 21:14.213
Good-bye, Mr. Lawson.

21:14.213 --> 21:15.422
Bye.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.189
Are you satisfied, Mr. Chen?

21:18.189 --> 21:21.287
You're right. He clearly suspects nothing.

21:21.287 --> 21:22.777
[beep]

21:31.437 --> 21:32.824
I know that it's unlikely,

21:32.824 --> 21:36.452
but you don't think it looks
a little like smallpox?

21:36.452 --> 21:39.370
The last known case of smallpox was 1977.

21:39.421 --> 21:42.125
I realize that, and I
know that it is a stretch,

21:42.125 --> 21:44.748
but they have these blankets

21:44.748 --> 21:48.249
that have been packed away for
decades in a cold basement.

21:48.249 --> 21:50.254
Come on. Just see the family.

21:50.254 --> 21:51.733
Take a look.

21:52.101 --> 21:53.424
I know what you're doing, Divya.

21:53.424 --> 21:56.659
You're trying to lure me back to
HankMed with a rare disease,

21:56.659 --> 21:58.616
but I am not built for clinical medicine.

21:58.616 --> 22:00.234
Of course, you are.

22:00.282 --> 22:02.763
You are a great doctor.

22:02.802 --> 22:04.366
All your patients would say so.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.415
Then they don't know me,
and you don't know me.

22:06.427 --> 22:08.731
Jeremiah, I do. I do know...

22:08.731 --> 22:10.408
This is where I belong, in a lab,

22:10.408 --> 22:12.086
not out there with people.

22:12.086 --> 22:14.998
And your refusal to see that

22:14.998 --> 22:18.098
and HankMed's attempt to... [voice quakes]

22:18.098 --> 22:20.053
[clears throat] to turn me into something

22:20.053 --> 22:22.861
that I am not, they are distractions...

22:22.861 --> 22:25.447
foolish, dangerous distractions.

22:40.690 --> 22:42.128
Mmm.

22:43.952 --> 22:45.389
[giggles]

22:45.389 --> 22:48.794
Blackberry promotes a pleasant sleepiness.

22:48.794 --> 22:51.097
And here I thought that
was Ken's conversation.

22:51.097 --> 22:53.002
Hilarious. But don't knock the incense.

22:53.002 --> 22:54.727
Helen uses it for her patients,

22:54.727 --> 22:56.253
depending on their aura that day.

22:56.253 --> 22:57.149
Oh.

22:57.149 --> 22:58.792
I'm usually a watermelon.

22:58.792 --> 23:00.319
You are a watermelon.

23:00.319 --> 23:02.188
Oof. Whatever.

23:02.188 --> 23:04.769
I'm gonna have to excuse
myself for a minute.

23:04.769 --> 23:06.644
You kids keep talking.

23:11.116 --> 23:12.823
Mmm! Helen,

23:12.833 --> 23:18.157
these are the best walnut
chorizo enchiladas ever.

23:18.157 --> 23:19.757
Thank you.

23:20.219 --> 23:22.867
You two... enjoy.

23:27.444 --> 23:31.041
Your sister's an amazing cook... amazing.

23:34.603 --> 23:36.663
You just wish she was a
better matchmaker, right?

23:36.663 --> 23:38.901
No, no, no, no.

23:38.944 --> 23:42.627
I just wish the whole age difference

23:42.627 --> 23:44.353
didn't make this so awkward.

23:44.353 --> 23:47.588
I think maturity is attractive.

23:53.157 --> 23:54.807
Speaking of which,

23:54.835 --> 23:57.473
I didn't expect you to be
so strong and confident

23:57.473 --> 23:59.659
after the way Helen
described your bad breakup.

23:59.659 --> 24:03.674
Oh, that's just my big sister,
always worrying about me.

24:03.674 --> 24:05.999
Well, maybe she worries

24:05.999 --> 24:07.423
because she's been there before with you

24:07.423 --> 24:09.044
and doesn't want to see you get hurt.

24:09.044 --> 24:12.884
Or maybe she can't get over her own breakups

24:12.884 --> 24:14.428
and is projecting.

24:14.925 --> 24:16.573
That was pretty deep.

24:16.573 --> 24:20.659
God, I wish I had that kind of
insight when I was your age.

24:21.312 --> 24:25.249
So you got an older brother
who does the same thing to you?

24:25.249 --> 24:27.170
No, no.

24:27.170 --> 24:30.530
I am that older brother,
though my case is different.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.015
My brother's always in trouble.

24:32.015 --> 24:33.871
- Always?
- Mm-hmm.

24:34.487 --> 24:37.767
Sounds like he never gets the
chance to prove you wrong.

24:37.767 --> 24:41.322
But what do I know... at my age?

24:41.322 --> 24:42.235
You just took what I said

24:42.235 --> 24:45.184
and turned it around to make it ironic.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.130
That was awesome.

24:47.130 --> 24:49.578
I try to be awesome every once in a while.

24:50.598 --> 24:53.154
I like that you're not abusing your powers.

24:59.985 --> 25:02.371
Oh, hey, don't let me spoil the moment.

25:02.371 --> 25:04.484
You did, but...

25:05.556 --> 25:07.195
Ken, are you okay?

25:07.195 --> 25:08.867
Actually, I'm feeling pretty pukey.

25:08.867 --> 25:10.504
Think I'm gonna hit the hot tub.

25:16.411 --> 25:18.264
You know what that smell is?

25:18.264 --> 25:19.498
That's love.

25:19.498 --> 25:20.989
[laughs]

25:43.104 --> 25:45.714
I might have spoken too soon
about that maturity thing.

25:45.714 --> 25:47.125
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

25:47.125 --> 25:49.269
It's not you. It's, uh, it's Ken.

25:49.269 --> 25:52.460
I think I know what he's
smelling, and it's not love.

25:52.460 --> 25:54.010
[gags]

25:57.553 --> 25:59.327
[laughs]

25:59.839 --> 26:02.482
I'm glad you find my ralphing so humorous.

26:02.482 --> 26:03.816
No, I don't. I don't.

26:03.816 --> 26:05.605
But I do know why it's happening.

26:05.605 --> 26:07.918
Keller, those butterflies
you get, do they only happen

26:07.918 --> 26:09.510
when you're around Helen's incense?

26:09.510 --> 26:10.722
Yeah, She's always burning the stuff.

26:10.722 --> 26:12.559
- Usually, I'm a...
- A watermelon.

26:12.559 --> 26:14.119
I know. But she showed me the package.

26:14.119 --> 26:17.048
It contains K2, a
synthetic form of marijuana

26:17.048 --> 26:19.445
often used in alternative healing.

26:19.445 --> 26:20.195
Wait, wait, wait.

26:20.195 --> 26:23.471
So I've been inhaling weed
for the last three weeks?

26:23.471 --> 26:25.832
Yes, and I think you're having
an unusual reaction to it

26:25.832 --> 26:28.150
called cannabinoid hyperemesis.

26:28.150 --> 26:29.523
It causes nausea and vomiting

26:29.523 --> 26:32.618
and is relieved by bathing in hot water.

26:35.117 --> 26:36.110
So wait.

26:36.110 --> 26:37.948
All these things I've
been feeling about Helen,

26:37.948 --> 26:39.045
they're not love?

26:39.045 --> 26:40.439
- They could still be love.
- No, no, no.

26:40.439 --> 26:42.591
No, just like you said.
It's a chemical reaction.

26:42.591 --> 26:43.729
No, but it could be love.

26:43.729 --> 26:46.113
It's not love! Thank God you told me now.

26:46.113 --> 26:48.783
I could have spent the rest of
my life stuck with one woman.

26:48.783 --> 26:50.429
That's not what I want.

26:50.785 --> 26:52.588
That's what you want.

26:52.588 --> 26:54.873
You're right. It is.

26:55.652 --> 26:58.854
But it's not just about finding
someone who wants it too.

26:58.865 --> 27:01.297
I need it to be someone who's...

27:01.297 --> 27:04.001
just right for me.

27:05.140 --> 27:07.745
Maybe those simple things
aren't as simple as I thought.

27:13.926 --> 27:15.866
(Jim) Now you want to blame me for this too?

27:15.866 --> 27:18.868
(Ed) Are you gonna be stupid and
irresponsible your whole life?

27:18.882 --> 27:21.066
Fine, until you get my daughter sick,

27:21.066 --> 27:22.263
and then I get involved!

27:22.263 --> 27:23.837
- Dad...
- You want to get involved?

27:23.837 --> 27:26.883
Stop it, both of you. Haven't
you two had enough?

27:28.688 --> 27:30.003
Okay, come on.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.795
Come on. Sit and relax.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.618
We need to figure out
what's causing this fever.

27:36.790 --> 27:38.608
Let's take a look at your rash.

27:38.608 --> 27:39.542
(Ed) You happy, Captain?

27:39.542 --> 27:41.176
You screwed yourself out of this house,

27:41.176 --> 27:43.628
now you're gonna keep your niece
from going to the Peace Corps?

27:43.628 --> 27:46.052
No. I'm going to be fine. Right, Divya?

27:46.052 --> 27:48.168
That's where you're going? The Peace Corps?

27:48.168 --> 27:49.647
Tunisia.

27:49.658 --> 27:52.770
So you recently had your physical,

27:52.770 --> 27:55.191
where you were vaccinated.

27:56.585 --> 28:00.268
Ah, I think I know what's
causing all your symptoms.

28:00.268 --> 28:01.501
It's called vaccinia.

28:01.501 --> 28:05.424
It's from a virus used in certain vaccines.

28:05.495 --> 28:09.348
In very few cases, it can
cause a fever and a rash

28:09.348 --> 28:11.809
that looks extremely similar to smallpox,

28:12.642 --> 28:16.057
and in close quarters, it can be contagious.

28:16.057 --> 28:19.236
Fortunately, it is temporary,
and it is harmless.

28:19.502 --> 28:23.721
So Mimi is going to be okay.

28:23.721 --> 28:26.313
Yes. With proper rest
and fluids, you all will.

28:26.327 --> 28:29.655
And my stupidity didn't get anyone sick.

28:29.655 --> 28:31.671
No. It was my stupidity.

28:31.671 --> 28:34.411
I should have known better,
'cause after all this time,

28:34.411 --> 28:37.052
I can't even make peace
within my own family.

29:08.194 --> 29:09.859
- Mr. Lawson.
- Yeah.

29:09.859 --> 29:10.610
I'm from shipping,

29:10.610 --> 29:12.695
here to precheck the site
for tonight's delivery.

29:12.695 --> 29:14.791
The area will be closed to foot traffic?

29:14.791 --> 29:16.062
Yes, it will.

29:16.062 --> 29:17.867
And we'll have access through the main gate?

29:17.867 --> 29:20.212
Of course, yes. We also
tested the trailer restraints.

29:20.212 --> 29:22.684
We replaced the snap rings
and clips on the dock levelers,

29:22.684 --> 29:25.226
and cleaned, filtered, and
recalibrated all the hydraulics.

29:25.226 --> 29:28.175
So, uh, we are... we are 100% ready to go.

29:28.579 --> 29:30.072
Excellent.

29:30.084 --> 29:31.782
Oh, and you're aware of the new time?

29:31.947 --> 29:33.380
Of course, midnight.

29:33.393 --> 29:35.106
Precisely.

29:53.278 --> 29:54.776
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey.

29:55.132 --> 29:56.736
I got your message. What's wrong?

29:56.736 --> 30:00.215
My chest is hurting now,
all the way down my arm.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.848
- Okay. Let's sit down.
- All right.

30:02.437 --> 30:05.624
I...I just want to get out of here

30:05.624 --> 30:08.524
after all that's gone on between Ed and me.

30:08.524 --> 30:12.220
But I feel awful for getting
Mimi caught between us.

30:12.220 --> 30:15.321
I suppose pitting brother against brother

30:15.321 --> 30:18.063
is as bad an idea now
as it was 150 years ago.

30:18.063 --> 30:19.430
Ah, hell.

30:19.430 --> 30:21.738
It's not Ed's fault he made a ton of money

30:21.843 --> 30:23.818
and I didn't.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.860
Besides... [labored breathing]

30:26.860 --> 30:28.720
I'm happier on the water.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.605
This is his land now.

30:30.617 --> 30:33.541
Better I just get out of his hair.

30:37.699 --> 30:39.168
Okay.

30:39.463 --> 30:43.411
Jim, chew this aspirin, please,
and open your shirt for me.

30:46.229 --> 30:48.536
Your pulse... it's erratic,

30:48.576 --> 30:51.009
and your blood pressure is high.

30:51.009 --> 30:53.940
It's possible that the
vaccinia spread to your heart.

30:53.940 --> 30:56.046
This nitropaste will open
up your blood vessels

30:56.046 --> 30:57.955
until we can get you to the... Jim.

30:57.955 --> 30:59.605
Jim... okay.

31:02.075 --> 31:03.429
Okay.

31:05.715 --> 31:07.346
No pulse.

31:13.060 --> 31:14.333
- 911.
- Yes.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.397
I have an acute myocardial
infarction in progress

31:16.397 --> 31:17.851
at the Harper estate.

31:18.582 --> 31:20.499
Hang in there, Jim. Help is on the way.

31:20.499 --> 31:22.212
Help is on the way.

31:28.315 --> 31:29.727
- 911.
- I'm calling again

31:29.727 --> 31:31.131
from the Harper estate.

31:31.131 --> 31:32.931
61-year-old male, AMI.

31:32.931 --> 31:34.705
Been doing compressions
for almost eight minutes.

31:34.705 --> 31:36.269
(man) Our ambulance is stuck in traffic.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.810
Please try to continue.

31:40.628 --> 31:42.342
Divya, oh, my God.
