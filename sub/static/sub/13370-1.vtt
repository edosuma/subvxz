WE'RE FOLLOWING
A BREAKING NEWS STORY

00:23.327 --> 00:25.242
FROM THE LOS ANGELES AREA.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.157
LOCAL STATE
AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

00:27.201 --> 00:28.506
HAVE RAIDED
A PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM

00:28.550 --> 00:31.074
ACCUSED OF MANUFACTURING
AND DISTRIBUTING

00:31.118 --> 00:34.382
A MULTITUDE OF COUNTERFEIT
VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.557
THIS RAID, OF COURSE,
COMES AS THE CULMINATION

00:35.600 --> 00:38.255
OF A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION

00:38.299 --> 00:41.215
BEGUN BY CCNN'S
OWN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT

00:41.258 --> 00:42.651
KELLY FARRADAY.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.479
KELLY, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

00:44.522 --> 00:46.263

00:46.307 --> 00:48.091

THIS INNOCENT-LOOKING
OFFICE BUILDING

00:51.051 --> 00:53.923
IN A SEEMINGLY QUIET
SUBURBAN INDUSTRIAL PARK

00:53.966 --> 00:55.620
AND UNCOVERED WHAT MAY BE

00:55.664 --> 00:58.014
THE LARGEST CASE OF
COUNTERFEIT...

00:58.058 --> 01:00.451
- HEY, RUTH.
YOUR DAUGHTER'S ON TV.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.192
-...SUPPLEMENTS
IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.411
I'M STANDING
IN FRONT OF THE FACILITY

01:03.454 --> 01:05.194
WHICH,
UNTIL JUST THIS MORNING,

01:05.239 --> 01:07.589
WAS STILL MANUFACTURING THESEBOGUS VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS,

01:07.632 --> 01:09.808
MANY OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY
ENDED UP ON STORE SHELVES

01:09.852 --> 01:11.593
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

01:11.636 --> 01:14.248
MEANING THEY COULD BE IN YOUR
MEDICINE CABINET RIGHT NOW.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.293
AS YOU CAN SEE,

01:16.337 --> 01:18.295
POLICE ARE NOW ESCORTING
THE ALLEGED RINGLEADERS

01:18.339 --> 01:21.037
OF THIS OPERATION
FROM THE CORPORATE OFFICES

01:21.081 --> 01:22.691
OF DUNCROFT PHARMACEUTICALS,

01:22.734 --> 01:25.650
A ONCE-REPUTABLE NUTRITIONAL
SUPPLEMENT MANUFACTURER.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.523
- DOESN'T YOUR MOM
LOOK PRETTY ON TV?

01:28.566 --> 01:31.308
- WITH ME NOW IS DETECTIVE
JIM BARTON OF THE LAPD...

01:31.352 --> 01:33.832
- THAT'S MY MOM.
SHE'S A ROTTWEILER.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.486
WITH MASCARA.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.098
- IF IT WERE NOT FORYOUR PERSISTENT INVESTIGATION,

01:38.141 --> 01:40.970
THIS BUSTWOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED TODAY.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.406
- CAN YOU HAND ME
A HOOF PICK, RUTH?

01:42.450 --> 01:44.626
-...MOST FRIGHTENING
ASPECTS OF THIS STORY

01:44.669 --> 01:46.497
IS, OF COURSE, THAT MANY OF USMAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKING

01:46.541 --> 01:48.064
THESE COUNTERFEIT SUPPLEMENTSFOR OVER A YEAR

01:48.108 --> 01:50.545
WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.286
- WHAT MAKES A COUNTERFEIT RING
LIKE THIS SO DANGEROUS

01:52.329 --> 01:54.505
IS THAT NONE OF THE ITEMS
PRODUCED HERE

01:54.549 --> 01:57.726
HAVE EVER BEEN INSPECTED
NOR APPROVED BY THE FDA.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.423
- SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.555
- THAT'S RIGHT, KELLY.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.078
- WELL, TODAY WE CAN ONLY HOPE

02:02.122 --> 02:03.558
THAT BY BRINGING
THESE CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE

02:03.601 --> 02:05.342
THE PUBLIC CAN BREATHE
A LITTLE EASIER

02:05.386 --> 02:06.996
KNOWING THAT THESE
COUNTERFEIT SUPPLEMENTS

02:07.039 --> 02:09.520
WILL NO LONGER BE PRODUCED.

PUT YOU BEHIND THE ANCHOR DESK.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.555

FOR AN EX-HUSBAND, RIGHT?

02:44.599 --> 02:47.210

THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.604

- WHERE IS HE?

02:57.351 --> 02:59.483

02:59.527 --> 03:03.183

03:03.226 --> 03:07.317

03:14.019 --> 03:17.197
- YEAH.
SO...

03:17.240 --> 03:19.068
HERE WE ALL ARE.
WHO'S FIRST?

03:19.111 --> 03:20.591
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.593
- YES, YOU DO.
- KELLY,

03:22.637 --> 03:24.421
WE'VE DECIDED TO GO
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.467
- YOU MEAN YOUNGER.
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.426
BASED ON THE RESULTS
OF A RECENT MARKET SURVEY,

03:29.470 --> 03:32.124
WE FEEL SHE'LL SIGNIFICANTLY
HELP OUR RATINGS.

03:32.168 --> 03:35.215
- COME ON, ROBERT.
MISS OHIO?

03:35.258 --> 03:37.260
both: IOWA.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.089
- C-CAN WE TALK

03:50.317 --> 03:52.232
SO...LET'S START AGAIN,

03:52.275 --> 03:54.277
HOW'S KAMILLA?
- SAME AS ALWAYS.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.887
MAD AT THE WORLD,
ESPECIALLY MAD AT YOU.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.454
- DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
GIVE HER A HUG FOR ME?

03:57.498 --> 03:59.456
- WHY DON'T YOU DO IT
YOURSELF?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.415
LAST WEEKEND WAS YOURS.
YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.112
- AND I SENT HER AN EMAIL.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.635
- IF YOU WANT A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER,

04:04.679 --> 04:06.681
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN AN EMAIL.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.596
ROBERT, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT BIMBO

04:08.639 --> 04:10.467
AS AN ANCHOR!

04:10.511 --> 04:12.643
YOU'VE ALREADY ANNOUNCEDTHAT I'M GONNA BE MADE ANCHOR.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.341
YOU SENT OUT
A PRESS RELEASE.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.386
- I'LL SEND OUT
ANOTHER PRESS RELEASE.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.649
AND DON'T WORRY--
YOU'LL BE WELL-COMPENSATED.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.652
- SHE IS NOT A JOURNALIST.- KELLY, THIS IS NOT A DEBATE.

04:21.696 --> 04:24.220
THE DECISION HAS
BEEN MADE.

04:30.052 --> 04:32.315
- THEN I QUIT.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.925
- YOUR DECISION.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.328
- YOU KNOW, I'M DEEP INTOTHE WHOLE "I HATE DAD" THING.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.416
BUT DON'T YOU--
- HEY, HONEY.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.070
HERE'S THE NEW GROUND RULES.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.028
WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT
DAD AGAIN FOR ANOTHER...

04:50.072 --> 04:53.510
YEAR...MAYBE TWO.

04:53.554 --> 04:56.687
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVEHE MADE THAT BIMBO THE ANCHOR.

04:56.731 --> 04:59.342
- MOM, REBECCA IS NOT A BIMBO.
SHE'S A HARVARD GRADUATE.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.997
- HONEY, DON'T SAY THAT.I NEED TO MAKE HER THE ENEMY.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.346
IT'S A PROCESS.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.522
- KAMILLA.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.222
- MOM, WHY DON'T YOU GO
WAIT IN THE CAR?

05:10.266 --> 05:12.050
I'LL JUST BE A SEC.
- I'M GONNA WAIT IN THE CAR.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.272
- HEY, UH...

05:16.316 --> 05:18.709
YOU LOOK...AMAZING.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.494
- GOOD ONE, DAD.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.584
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
LIKE THIS IN A WHILE.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.369
- SORRY ABOUT LAST WEEKEND.
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.023
I'VE GOTTEN USED TO YOU
DISAPPOINTING ME.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.459
- OUCH.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.547
- BUT HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO MOM?

05:30.591 --> 05:32.288
SHE MADE THIS NETWORK.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.769
- KAMILLA, SHE QUIT, OKAY?

05:34.812 --> 05:37.337
SHE MADE A BUSINESS DECISION.I MADE A BUSINESS DECISION.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.686
DON'T TURN IT
INTO SOMETHING PERSONAL.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.731
- YOU WERE MARRIED.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.691
EVERYTHING IS PERSONAL, DAD.
WHY CAN'T YOU LEARN THAT?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.954
- COULD I GET A HUG?

05:45.997 --> 05:49.087
- DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.725
- WHO IS IT?

06:17.768 --> 06:20.423
- MY NAME'S WALT.I WORK FOR YOUR GRANDMA RUTH.

06:20.467 --> 06:24.384
I'M AN OLD FRIEND
OF YOUR MOTHER'S.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.562
- IS THAT A PIECE OF STRAW
IN YOUR MOUTH?

06:28.605 --> 06:30.564
- MM-HMM.

06:30.607 --> 06:33.480
- COWS PEE ON THAT,

06:35.873 --> 06:37.527
- IS YOUR MOTHER HERE?

06:37.571 --> 06:39.703

06:41.836 --> 06:44.404

FOR YOURSELF.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.590

WALT...

07:05.990 --> 07:07.818

07:07.862 --> 07:09.559
- IT'S IMPORTANT.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.387
AND I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOU IN PERSON.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.650
- IS IT MY MOTHER?
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.479
- NOTHING'S HAPPENED.
- THEN...WHAT IS IT?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.002
- YOU KNOW RUTH
WOULD KILL ME

07:18.046 --> 07:20.440
IF SHE KNEW
I WAS EVEN HERE, RIGHT?

07:20.483 --> 07:22.311
SHE DON'T SEE SO GOOD
ANYMORE.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.487
AND DOC THORNE
SAYS IT'S BAD.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.447
IT'S GONNA GET WORSE.

07:27.490 --> 07:30.406
SHE MAY LOSE HER SIGHT
ALL THE WAY.

07:34.366 --> 07:39.023
- NEVADA, THE SILVER STATE.
YAY.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.851
- OKAY, HONEY, WE'LL BE THEREIN ABOUT AN HOUR.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.506

07:43.550 --> 07:45.421
- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN
WITH GRANDMA?

07:45.465 --> 07:49.033
- I DON'T KNOW.
- SELLING THE RANCH?

07:49.077 --> 07:50.513
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.776
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.779
- THINK SHE'LL MOVE AND COME
LIVE WITH US IN L.A.?

07:55.823 --> 07:59.304
- I DOUBT IT.
SHE LIKES THE COUNTRY.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.492
- SO WHEN DO WE GET TO TOWN?
- THIS IS IT.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.058
THIS IS MAIN STREET.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.888
LET'S STOP AND GET
A CUP OF COFFEE, KAMILLA.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.890
- YOU SURE YOU HAVE ROOM ENOUGH
FOR US ALL TO COME OVER?

08:19.934 --> 08:21.588

10:57.831 --> 10:59.571

11:03.271 --> 11:04.794
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.796

11:06.840 --> 11:08.711
OUTSTANDING

11:08.755 --> 11:10.104
EVEN IF HE IS MY NEPHEW.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.541

SEEN YOU ON TV.

11:12.584 --> 11:16.240
- I WAS JUST TELLING KELLY

11:16.284 --> 11:17.851
- TOUGH TIMES,
TOUGH DECISIONS.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.897
THE DROUGHT'S HIT THIS TOWN
PRETTY HARD.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.856
BUT THINGS'LL CHANGE
BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.075
PROSPER, NEVADA

11:25.119 --> 11:26.860

11:26.903 --> 11:29.689
CASINO, CONDOS, FASHION MALL--THE WORKS.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.605
- WOW.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.825

11:48.838 --> 11:51.580

12:07.335 --> 12:10.468

OH, MY GOODNESS!

12:10.512 --> 12:12.122
YOU'VE GROWN LIKE RAGWEED.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.690
- THAT BETTER BE A COMPLIMENT.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.344
- HELLO, KELLY.

12:16.387 --> 12:19.086
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:19.129 --> 12:20.957
WHAT IF I JUST WANNA

12:21.001 --> 12:23.699
- YOU HAVEN'T COME FOR A VISITIN A LONG TIME.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.745
THANK GOD I MAKE THE EFFORT

12:25.788 --> 12:27.877

12:34.754 --> 12:35.972
- I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.800
- WE HAVE,
BUT YOU WERE ONLY THREE.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.020
WALT MITCHELL,
YOUR GRANDMA'S RIGHT HAND.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.762
- WALT AND YOUR MOTHER
USED TO BE SWEETHEARTS.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.068

[laughs]

12:45.112 --> 12:48.202
- WE DATED BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.552

12:50.595 --> 12:52.946
[whinnies and snorts]

12:52.989 --> 12:55.600
HE'S SO PRETTY.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.953
- BIG BEN'S
A LITTLE BIT ORNERY.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.781
- CAREFUL, HONEY.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.005
- SHE IS GLAD TO SEE YOU.

13:09.049 --> 13:12.661

13:19.450 --> 13:21.322
SO HOW YOU FEELING, MOM?

13:21.365 --> 13:24.716
- FINE. BUT DON'T LETANYONE SWINDLE YOU INTO THINKING

13:24.760 --> 13:28.198
THAT GROWING OLD IS FUN.

13:28.242 --> 13:31.636
- AND HOW'S THE RANCH?
- WHY DO YOU ASK?

13:31.680 --> 13:34.291
- WELL...THE DROUGHT.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.077
- WE'VE HAD DROUGHTS BEFORE,
BUT THIS ONE'S KILLIN' US.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.993
- THE RANCH IS FINE.
- NO, IT'S NOT, RUTH.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.951
- WALT, EAT YOUR LUNCH.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.432
THE MILLERS SOLD THE FARM.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.216
- THE MILLERS?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.870
THEY'VE BEEN HERE
FOR GENERATIONS.

13:47.914 --> 13:51.961
- WELL, THEY LEFT.
LAST MONTH.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.224
THEY SOLD TO THAT
COWBOY CASINO GROUP.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.923
THE DUNFIELD FARM
WENT LAST WEEK.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.055
NOW, THAT'S A SHAME.

13:59.099 --> 14:04.017
I'M NOT SELLING, NO MATTER
WHO PACKS UP AND RUNS.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.236
- WHY DON'T WE TAKE
A RIDE AFTER LUNCH?

14:06.280 --> 14:07.934
- SURE.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.073
[bird cries]

14:28.911 --> 14:31.827
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
WHERE DID ALL THE WATER GO?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.481
WE USED TO GO SWIMMING
HERE, REMEMBER?

14:33.524 --> 14:36.310
- YEAH. ALL THE WELLS
AROUND HERE ARE DRYING UP,

14:36.353 --> 14:38.747
INCLUDING OURS.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.019
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

14:50.063 --> 14:52.935
THE HAY,
EVERYTHING'S LOOKING PUNY.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.676
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH WATER.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.504
WE CAN'T IRRIGATE IT ALL.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.332
I CALLED THE GUY IN PROSPER
TO COME CHECK OUT OUR WELL,

14:58.375 --> 14:59.637
MAYBE DIG IT DEEPER.

14:59.681 --> 15:02.902
THAT'S ALL I KNOW TO DO.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.729
- WE NEED TO BE PRAGMATIC.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.383
WITH MY MOM'S EYESIGHT

15:06.427 --> 15:08.951
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE,

15:08.995 --> 15:10.997
MAYBE THE OFFER
FROM THE CASINO GROUP IS...

15:11.040 --> 15:13.260
JUST THE RIGHT THING
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

15:13.303 --> 15:16.045
- YOU KNOW, I CAME TO SEE YOUIN L.A. FOR YOUR HELP,

15:16.089 --> 15:18.265
NOT TO JUST GIVE UP
AND SELL OUT.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.484
- YOU'RE LETTING EMOTION
GET IN THE WAY

15:20.528 --> 15:22.051
OF THINKING ABOUTWHAT'S PRACTICAL AND RATIONAL.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.923
- RATIONAL?

15:23.966 --> 15:25.315
- I DON'T SEE HOW
DIGGING A DEEPER WELL

15:25.359 --> 15:27.143
CAN SOLVE
ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS.

15:27.187 --> 15:30.277
- HOW ABOUT FOUR GENERATIONS
OF TRADITION,

15:30.320 --> 15:32.714
THIS FAMILY'S ROOTS--DOES THAT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?

15:32.757 --> 15:34.455
- MOM, I JUST WANT TO--

15:34.498 --> 15:35.630
- IF YOU THINK
YOU CAN JUST SHOW UP HERE

15:35.673 --> 15:37.371
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

15:37.414 --> 15:39.068
AND TALK ME INTO
SELLING THIS PLACE,

15:39.112 --> 15:40.983
YOU'VE GOT
ANOTHER THING COMING.

15:41.027 --> 15:44.726
- MOM...I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR EYESIGHT.

15:48.121 --> 15:51.689
- WALTER, I'M DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.909
AS FOR YOU, YOUNG LADY,

15:53.953 --> 15:55.693
YOU CAN GET BACK
IN YOUR FANCY CAR

15:55.737 --> 15:58.958
AND GO BACK TO YOUR FANCY LIFEAND LEAVE US THE HECK ALONE.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.620
- GET YOUR STUFF.
WE'RE LEAVING.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.630
- YOU KNOW, MOM,

16:19.674 --> 16:21.284
SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FORGIVE HER.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.982
- FOR WHAT?

16:23.025 --> 16:24.984
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.072
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S SO ANGRY.

16:26.115 --> 16:29.162
[thud]

16:29.205 --> 16:32.295
- OH...
- GRANDMA!

16:32.339 --> 16:38.040
- LET ME HELP YOU.
IT'S OKAY.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.956
WHAT HAPPENED?
- I MISSED A STEP.

16:43.437 --> 16:47.310
I'M NOT SELLING THIS RANCH
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.921
IS THAT CLEAR?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.923
- YES.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.230
OKAY. LET'S SAVE THE RANCH.

16:54.274 --> 16:59.192
- SO...WHAT'S THE PLAN?

16:59.235 --> 17:03.239
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- WELL...

17:03.283 --> 17:06.808
IT'S A START.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.553
[electronic tone]

17:12.596 --> 17:14.642
- GETTING ALL SETTLED IN?

17:14.685 --> 17:17.210
- YEAH.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.950
[exhales]

17:18.993 --> 17:21.214
SO THIS USED TO BE YOUR ROOM?

17:21.257 --> 17:23.259
- YEAH.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.049
MY DAD MADE THIS FOR ME
FOR MY FIFTH BIRTHDAY.

17:32.442 --> 17:36.098
- HEY, MOM...LISTEN.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.927
[coyotes yipping,
crickets]

17:38.970 --> 17:41.495
- THESE SOUNDS USED TO HELP MESLEEP AT NIGHT.

17:41.538 --> 17:45.673
MAYBE THEY'LL DO
THE SAME FOR YOU.

17:45.716 --> 17:48.067
- YOU'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, MOM.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.286
- YOU THINK SO?
[cell phone rings]

17:50.330 --> 17:52.810
[ringing]

17:56.205 --> 17:58.468
KAMILLA,
HE'S REACHING OUT TO YOU.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.470
- SO?

18:00.514 --> 18:04.170
- HE'S YOUR FATHER.HE'S THE ONLY ONE YOU'VE GOT.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.462
- IT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE WAY HE LEFT IT.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.334
YOUR FATHER WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THIS RANCH.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.728
- CAN WE PLEASE NOT GO
INTO THAT AGAIN?

18:40.771 --> 18:44.253
I LEFT TO PURSUE A CAREER.

18:44.297 --> 18:47.126
- YOU MAY FIND THIS
HARD TO BELIEVE,

18:47.169 --> 18:49.215
BUT YOU'RE IN MY THOUGHTS
EVERY DAY.

18:49.258 --> 18:50.520
- THANKS.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.219
- SEE YOU AT BREAKFAST.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.141
[lowing]

19:13.935 --> 19:15.154
[nickering]

19:22.422 --> 19:25.555
- HERE WE GO.
BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.775
- HEY.
- KELLY.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.386
BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.
YOUR FAVORITE.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.172
THERE YOU ARE.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.175
WELL, DIG IN.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.220
- SO I MADE A LIST
OF ALL THE THINGS

19:38.264 --> 19:40.353
THAT NEED TO BE FIXED, REPLACED,AND CHANGED AROUND HERE

19:40.396 --> 19:41.745
TO MAKE THE RANCH
LOOK LIKE NEW AGAIN.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.486
- I CAN'T AFFORD IT.
- OH, I CAN, MOM.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.793
SO PLEASE LET ME
DO THIS FOR YOU.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.535
- FINE.
[laughs]

19:48.578 --> 19:51.407
GIVE US A MAKEOVER
IF THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.104
BUT DON'T EXPECT PANCAKES
EVERY MORNING.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.541
- OKAY.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.804
SO...BARN NEEDS
A FRESH COAT OF PAINT,

19:56.847 --> 19:58.588
AND ALL THE OLD FENCES
NEED TO BE REPLACED.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.069
- NO ARGUMENT THERE.
FIRST THINGS FIRST, THOUGH.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.810
WE GOTTA GET SOME WATER
ON THIS RANCH.

20:02.853 --> 20:05.595
A WATER ENGINEER WILL BE HEREAT 10:00 TO TEST THE WELL.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.207
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.562
- SEE, YOU GOTTA HAVE MORE.
- MORE WHAT--MORE WATER?

20:15.605 --> 20:17.390
- YEAH, AND MORE GALLONS
PER MINUTE.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.565
YOU'RE DOWN TO UNDER
10 GALLONS PER MINUTE.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.567
THAT'S NO GOOD.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.482
- CAN A WATER TABLE DRY UP?
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

20:22.525 --> 20:24.310
- THE UNCONFINED AQUIFER?
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.355
WE COULD ALWAYS GO DEEPER.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.400
- THAT'S GONNA GET EXPENSIVE
REAL QUICK.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.228
- 200 A FOOT.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.751
- WHERE COULD ALL THE WATER
BE GOING?

20:30.794 --> 20:32.231
- WELL, IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE

20:32.274 --> 20:34.058
AS A SEISMIC SHIFT
IN THE BEDROCK.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.191
- A DROUGHT'S TEMPORARY.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.541
LOSS OF WATER SOURCE
IS PERMANENT.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.762
- WELL, FOR NOW, WE START
TRUCKING IN WATER.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.329
[laughter]

20:43.372 --> 20:45.418
- HEY, GRANDMA.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.768
- HI, HONEY.
COME ON IN.

20:47.811 --> 20:50.640
- WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?
- A QUILTING BEE.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.687
LADIES, THIS IS MY
GRANDDAUGHTER, KAMILLA.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.298
14 GOING ON 40.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:56.342 --> 20:59.127
- SMART AS A WHIP,
AND SASSY AS THEY COME.

20:59.170 --> 21:02.304
- JUST LIKE MY GRANDMA.
[women chuckling]

21:02.348 --> 21:03.871
SO WHAT ARE THESE QUILTS
FOR ANYWAY?

21:03.914 --> 21:06.395
- TO RAFFLE OFF
AT THE STREET DANCE.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.789
EVERY YEAR, ABOUT THIS TIME.

21:08.832 --> 21:12.488
- YES. WE RAISE MONEY
FOR THE AUXILIARY.

21:12.532 --> 21:15.448
WE GALS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.580
- CAN I WATCH?

21:17.624 --> 21:20.366
- OH, WE'D LOVE IT.
YES, GET A CHAIR.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.460
- YOU KNOW, THOSE CASINO PEOPLE
CAME BY AGAIN YESTERDAY.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.244
- OH, NO, NOT YOU TOO.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.638
- WE'VE HAD TO SELL
FARM EQUIPMENT

21:31.681 --> 21:33.466
JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.903
I'VE NEVER SEEN MY HUSBAND
SO DEPRESSED.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.731
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

21:37.774 --> 21:41.474
WE'RE THINKING OF...
TAKING THE OFFER.

21:41.517 --> 21:44.651
THE FAMILY FARM IS DEAD.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.610
[sympathetic murmuring]

21:48.959 --> 21:50.744
- OH, COME ON, SAM!

21:50.787 --> 21:53.355
- YOU'VE BEEN WAY TOO SLOWTO RESPOND ON THIS WATER CRISIS.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.314
DELAYS, DENIALS--
THAT'S YOUR STORY, SAM.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.750
THAT MAKES YOU
PARTLY RESPONSIBLE

21:56.793 --> 21:58.578
FOR THIS WHOLE THING.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.580
- ALL RIGHT, WALT, BEFORE
YOU GET TOO CARRIED AWAY,

22:00.623 --> 22:03.365
WE HAVE INSTALLED
MONITORING DEVICES,

22:03.409 --> 22:07.326
AND WE ARE CONDUCTING ANALYSISON VARIOUS UNTAPPED RESOURCES.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.719
- SAM, UH...SAM,

22:09.763 --> 22:12.331
I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO GO ON RECORD

22:12.374 --> 22:15.377
THAT WE SHOULD NOT
AND CANNOT

22:15.421 --> 22:17.379
SELL OUT TO THIS
COWBOY CASINO GROUP.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.555
- RUTH HANSON,
CAN I JUST SAY AGAIN,

22:19.599 --> 22:22.602
THIS MEETING TONIGHT
IS NOT ABOUT THE CASINO.

22:22.645 --> 22:26.388

24:54.014 --> 24:55.885

24:55.929 --> 24:58.584
THANK YOU.

24:58.627 --> 25:02.675

FREE.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.117

25:10.160 --> 25:13.207
IT'S NOT SOME JOB

25:28.527 --> 25:30.137
- NO, IT'S JUST THAT
BEING HERE

25:30.180 --> 25:31.834
IS PUSHING ALL SORTS
OF EMOTIONAL BUTTONS FOR ME.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.750
SO IF WE COULD JUST--

SHE AND YOUR GRANDPA BUILT
PLENTY OF FENCES WAY BACK THEN.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.120
- CAN'T BELIEVE THE BEAUTY
QUEEN USED TO BE A TOMBOY.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.992
- OH, YES...
SHE COULD ROPE A STEER

25:59.035 --> 26:01.777
BETTER THAN YOUR GRANDPA.

26:01.821 --> 26:03.736

26:03.779 --> 26:05.694
HOW DID HE DIE?

26:05.738 --> 26:08.523
MOM WON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.- A HEART ATTACK.

26:08.567 --> 26:13.006

26:48.694 --> 26:53.002
SOMETIMES IT'S FOGGY...
AND OUT OF FOCUS.

26:53.046 --> 26:56.789

ALL I SEE IS SHADOWS.

26:56.832 --> 27:01.663

36:04.249 --> 36:06.294
- SAM DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.688
SAM WANTS MONEY...
AND HE WILL RUIN THE TOWN,

36:08.731 --> 36:12.387
AND HE'LL SELL 'EM OUT.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.563

36:20.395 --> 36:23.355
[engine turns off]

36:23.398 --> 36:25.879
- THINGS CAN'T ALWAYS
STAY THE SAME, WALT.

36:25.922 --> 36:29.578
- THAT'S A REAL SHAME.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.319
I--UH, I'M SORRY.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.767

36:44.811 --> 36:49.685
- NOTHING.
- NOTHING?

36:49.729 --> 36:52.819
I KNOW WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS,
AND THAT WAS NOT NOTHING.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.778
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.302
- MORNING.

36:57.345 --> 37:01.349

- OKAY...

37:17.409 --> 37:18.888
- WELL?

37:18.932 --> 37:20.194
- THE PIPES AND PUMP
WERE RECENTLY INSTALLED.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.761
AND THE STORM TUNNEL.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.415
THE BOTTLENECK APPEARS
TO BE DIVERTING WATER

37:23.458 --> 37:25.460
FROM THE UNCONFINED AQUIFER.
- WHAT'S THAT?

37:25.504 --> 37:27.462
- THE WATER'S
JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE.

37:27.506 --> 37:28.463
THE CONFINED AQUIFER
IS FURTHER BELOW,

37:28.507 --> 37:29.856
BENEATH HARDER ROCK.

37:29.899 --> 37:32.032
- SO DIVERTING WATER...
WHERE?

37:32.075 --> 37:33.642
- I'M NOT SURE.

37:33.686 --> 37:35.165
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY DIVERTING WATER?

37:35.209 --> 37:37.298
- STEALING WATER.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.387
THIS IS WHY OUR WELLS
ARE RUNNING DRY.

37:39.431 --> 37:42.477
- WHO OWNS THIS LAND?
- IT'S TOWNSHIP LAND.

37:42.521 --> 37:45.611
THE LAND BEING HELD IN ESCROWFOR THE CASINO.

37:57.623 --> 38:00.234
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.584
SHE LOOKS BRAND-NEW,

38:02.628 --> 38:04.369

WE'RE GONNA BE BUILDING
A BIG NEW AUTO MALL

38:10.940 --> 38:12.551
NEXT TO THE NEW CASINO.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.857
- AH, GREAT.I'M SORRY ABOUT WALT LAST NIGHT.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.903
- AW, NO APOLOGY'S NECESSARY.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.992
CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE.

38:19.035 --> 38:21.603
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO SERVETHE WILL OF THE PEOPLE, RIGHT?

38:21.647 --> 38:23.518

38:24.954 --> 38:26.695

38:26.739 --> 38:28.697
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

38:28.741 --> 38:31.309
I THINK SOMEONEIS STEALING THE TOWN'S WATER.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.180
- STEALING WATER?
- YEAH.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.356
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STRANGE--
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.662
- HAVE YOU BEEN OUT
TO TOWNSHIP ROAD 5 LATELY?

38:36.705 --> 38:38.359
- NO. WHY?

38:38.403 --> 38:39.969
- THERE'S A HOLE IN
THE GROUND

38:40.013 --> 38:41.493
WITH A PUMPING SYSTEM
AND PIPES, HEADED DUE WEST.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.364
- REALLY?

38:43.408 --> 38:45.497
- ISN'T THAT THE LANDYOU'RE SELLING TO THE CASINO?

38:45.540 --> 38:47.325

NORRIS PROPERTIES.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.283

38:51.416 --> 38:53.331
BUT SOMEONE
IS DIVERTING THE WATER.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.723
- WELL,
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.943
- YEAH.

38:56.986 --> 38:59.859

BELLS IF I WERE YOU, KELLY.

38:59.902 --> 39:02.383
NO ONE WANTS TO JEOPARDIZE
THIS CASINO DEAL...

39:02.427 --> 39:05.778
DASH THE HOPES
AND DREAMS OF THIS TOWN.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.432
- MAYBE YOU COULD JUST DELAY

39:07.475 --> 39:10.391
THE CLOSE OF ESCROW
ON THE LAND SALE

39:10.435 --> 39:12.437
UNTIL THIS WATER BUSINESS
IS FIGURED OUT.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.570
- I'M THE MAYOR, SWEETHEART,
NOT GOD.

39:15.614 --> 39:19.400
BUT I'LL LOOK INTO IT.
YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.881

IT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE...

39:48.821 --> 39:52.477

40:26.902 --> 40:29.383

40:29.427 --> 40:31.603
IT'S ABOUT THE CASINO.

40:31.646 --> 40:34.170

AROUND HERE.

40:34.214 --> 40:36.477
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.654
I THINK THE CASINO IS DIVERTING
WATER FROM THE TOWN.

40:39.698 --> 40:42.788
- THAT'S QUITE AN ACCUSATION.- I KNOW.

40:42.831 --> 40:45.573
- YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?

40:45.617 --> 40:47.619
- MAYBE.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.490

THE CASINO DEAL.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.492

41:00.762 --> 41:02.808
BETWEEN THE CASINO
AND DIVERTING THE WATER?

41:02.851 --> 41:05.767
- I DON'T KNOW.I KNOW THAT IT'S BEING DIVERTED.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.943
- SEEMS LIKE
AN EXTREME MEASURE

41:07.987 --> 41:11.512
TO GET US TO GIVE UP FARMING FORA CASINO, DON'T YOU THINK?

41:11.556 --> 41:14.341
- MAYBE.

41:14.384 --> 41:17.518
MAYBE NOT.
WHO'S AGAINST THE CASINO?

41:17.562 --> 41:19.433
THE FARMERS
AND THE RANCHERS.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.653
TOUGH TIMES,
TOUGH DECISIONS.

41:21.696 --> 41:24.917
ISN'T THAT WHAT SAM SAID?

41:24.960 --> 41:27.920
- WE HAVE TO EXPOSE
WHO'S EVER BEHIND THIS

41:27.963 --> 41:30.009
BEFORE THAT PUBLIC LAND
TURNS PRIVATE.

41:30.052 --> 41:31.619

46:14.684 --> 46:16.295
IT'S ABOUT THE TOWN COUNCIL.

46:16.338 --> 46:17.775

FOR THE TRANSFER
OF TOWNSHIP LAND

46:21.430 --> 46:23.215
TO A PRIVATE COMPANY
OR INDIVIDUAL?

46:23.258 --> 46:26.174
- THE SALE HAS TO BE CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY BY THE COUNCIL.

46:26.218 --> 46:27.828
- SO YOU VOTED TO APPROVE
THE SALE OF THE LAND

46:27.872 --> 46:29.221
TO THE CASINO?

46:29.264 --> 46:31.701
- WELL, NO, I--
I MISSED A FEW MEETINGS,

46:31.745 --> 46:33.268
MY WIFE BEING SICK AND ALL.

46:33.312 --> 46:35.140
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
I'M NOT AGAINST IT.

46:35.183 --> 46:39.405
I'VE BEEN TO RENO.
I LIKE THE SLOTS.

46:39.448 --> 46:42.016

A COPY OF THE TOWN'S BYLAWS?

46:42.060 --> 46:44.105

46:44.149 --> 46:45.803

46:45.846 --> 46:48.109
OF THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE.- OKAY.

46:48.153 --> 46:49.458

46:49.502 --> 46:51.417
I REMEMBER THE DAY
YOU WERE BORN.

46:51.460 --> 46:53.288
32 HOURS OF LABOR.

46:53.332 --> 46:55.987
I TOLD RUTH, "THIS ONE IS GONNA
BE A BASKET OF TROUBLE."

47:22.100 --> 47:23.536
TOWN COUNCIL
MEETING MINUTES.

47:23.579 --> 47:25.146
- OKAY, JUST ONE MINUTE.

47:29.107 --> 47:30.238
THERE'S ONE.

47:42.947 --> 47:45.079
- NOW, KELLY,
I AM EATING MY LUNCH.

47:45.123 --> 47:46.428
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND--

47:46.472 --> 47:47.908
I JUST HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

47:47.952 --> 47:49.736
HOW CAN THE SALE

47:49.779 --> 47:52.217
WHEN IT WAS NOT UNANIMOUSLYAPPROVED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL?

47:52.260 --> 47:53.871
- BOY, YOU SURE DO
LIKE TO PLAY

47:53.914 --> 47:55.742
THAT PEDAL ON THE ORGAN,
DON'T YOU?

47:55.785 --> 47:57.918

ONE MOMENT, HE WAS GONE,

49:41.456 --> 49:42.980
AND THE NEXT MOMENT,
SO WERE YOU.

50:32.203 --> 50:34.248
THAT'S WHERE
HE MET MY MOM.

50:34.292 --> 50:36.250
MISS CALIFORNIA.

50:36.294 --> 50:38.122
AND THEN, FOUR YEARS AGO,HE WAS AT SOME OTHER PAGEANT,

50:38.165 --> 50:41.081
AND THAT'S WHERE HE MET
MISS IOWA.

50:41.125 --> 50:42.343
- SORRY.

50:42.387 --> 50:43.562
- IT'S OKAY.

50:43.605 --> 50:44.954
I DON'T THINK MY PARENTS

50:44.998 --> 50:47.914
WERE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER
FOREVER.

50:47.957 --> 50:49.046
YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE JUST AREN'T.

50:52.092 --> 50:53.441
- PEANUT BUTTER, JELLY,

50:55.878 --> 50:58.446
THANK YOU.

50:58.490 --> 51:01.101
YOU KNOW WHAT?

51:01.145 --> 51:02.755
YOU JUST MIGHT
HAVE POTENTIAL.

51:02.798 --> 51:04.887
- POTENTIAL FOR WHAT?

51:06.280 --> 51:07.064
- FORGET IT.

51:11.981 --> 51:14.680
- THERE'S MY GRANDMA'S PLACE.

51:14.723 --> 51:16.116
AND THERE'S
YOUR GRANDMA'S RANCH.

51:16.160 --> 51:18.249
YOU KNOW,
BACK IN COWBOY DAYS,

51:18.292 --> 51:19.772
THESE ROBBERS HELD UP
A STAGECOACH HERE,

51:19.815 --> 51:21.165
FIGURING IT'D BE EASY.

51:21.208 --> 51:23.515
YOU KNOW, SMALL TOWN,
NO ONE AROUND.

51:23.558 --> 51:24.472
BUT THEY DIDN'T FIGURE
ON THE SHERIFF.

51:24.516 --> 51:26.039
- HE TOOK ON THE ROBBERS?

51:26.083 --> 51:27.258
- SHETOOK ON THE ROBBERS.

51:27.301 --> 51:29.129
- THE SHERIFF WAS A "SHE"?

51:29.173 --> 51:31.436
- YEP. THERE WAS A BIG
SHOOTOUT, AND THE ROBBERS FLED.

51:31.479 --> 51:33.133
SHE CHASED THEM
ALL THE WAY INTO THOSE HILLS

51:33.177 --> 51:34.700
AND BROUGHT THEM TO JUSTICE.

51:34.743 --> 51:36.223
ONLY WHEN SHE HAD THEM CUFFEDDID SHE REALIZE

51:36.267 --> 51:38.312
SHE'D CAUGHT SOME BIG FISH.

51:38.356 --> 51:39.531
SEE, THOSE BOYS
WERE PART OF THE JAMES GANG.

51:39.574 --> 51:42.621

51:44.362 --> 51:45.885
YOUR GRANDMA RUTH'S
GREAT, GREAT GRANDMOTHER.

51:45.928 --> 51:47.191

I'M A PART OF HISTORY.

51:52.718 --> 51:53.936
[rustling]
WHAT WAS THAT?

51:56.548 --> 51:57.505
[car door slams]

51:57.549 --> 52:01.509
[second car pulling up]

52:01.553 --> 52:03.250
[gravel crunching]

52:06.253 --> 52:08.255
- LET'S GO.

52:08.299 --> 52:10.518
YOU'VE TAKEN ENOUGH
OF MY TIME ALREADY.

52:10.562 --> 52:12.216
- YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE
TO BE SNEAKING AROUND.

52:12.259 --> 52:15.480
I'VE GOT A REPUTATION

52:15.523 --> 52:16.829
YOU KNOW, WE COULD HAVE

TO WAIT TILL

52:21.399 --> 52:22.487
THE END OF ESCROW

52:22.530 --> 52:25.751
- I HAVE A TIMETABLE.

52:25.794 --> 52:27.318
THIS DEAL GOES SOUTH,

52:27.361 --> 52:29.058
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
GETTING REELECTED.

52:29.102 --> 52:31.148
- ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

52:31.191 --> 52:33.541
- NIP THIS THING
IN THE BUD, SAM.

52:33.585 --> 52:34.934
YOU HAVE A LOT AT STAKE.

52:34.977 --> 52:37.371
WE DON'T WANT
SOME NEWSPAPER STORY

52:37.415 --> 52:39.765
TURNING THE TIDE
IN YOUR TOWN, NOW, DO WE?

52:39.808 --> 52:42.985
- I'M ON IT.

52:47.381 --> 52:51.211
- I'VE NEVER BEEN
BIG FAN OF SAM'S.

52:51.255 --> 52:54.388
BUT HE'S A POLITICIAN,
NOT A CROOK.

52:54.432 --> 52:55.694
- RUTH, SAM WOULD STEAL
A HOT STOVE

52:55.737 --> 52:57.783
AND GO BACK FOR THE SMOKE.

52:57.826 --> 52:59.393

52:59.437 --> 53:01.526

BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE

53:03.267 --> 53:05.834
THE OTHER GUY
WAS THREATENING HIM.

53:12.624 --> 53:14.191
- HEY, GRANDMA.

53:14.234 --> 53:15.627

53:24.853 --> 53:26.377

GREAT GRANDMOTHER.

53:26.420 --> 53:28.161
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?

53:28.205 --> 53:30.207
I COULDN'T
HOLD A CANDLE TO HER.

53:32.600 --> 53:33.601
- CAN I HOLD THIS ONE?

53:33.645 --> 53:35.386
- SURE. CAREFUL.

53:35.429 --> 53:37.257
- IS IT LOADED?

53:37.301 --> 53:41.305
- NO, NOT FOR ALMOST
100 YEARS.

53:46.571 --> 53:48.616
- GRANDMA BARNES
MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING.

53:48.660 --> 53:51.184
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

53:51.228 --> 53:54.056
HEH, SHE LOVED THIS TOWN.

53:54.100 --> 53:55.536
SHE LOVED THE PEOPLE.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.364
THAT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH
ANYMORE.

53:57.408 --> 53:58.539
- BUT SHE SAVED THIS TOWN.

53:58.583 --> 54:00.628
CHUCK TOLD ME.

54:00.672 --> 54:01.673
- THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

54:01.716 --> 54:04.023

54:04.066 --> 54:05.242
WONDER WHO THAT COULD BE.

54:08.593 --> 54:10.551

54:39.580 --> 54:42.279

- THIS'LL BE THE FIRST...

54:47.675 --> 54:49.634
DEADLINE I'VE MISSED
IN 15 YEARS.

54:49.677 --> 54:53.072
[crowd chattering]

55:08.609 --> 55:10.045
- THEY JUST TRASHED THE PLACEFOR NO REASON.

55:10.089 --> 55:12.831
[indistinct chatter]

"IF YOU CAN TELL IN YOUR GUT
THAT SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT,

55:20.404 --> 55:22.362
GET BACK OUT THERE
AND KEEP DIGGING"?

55:22.406 --> 55:25.104
WE'LL SET UP AN OFFICE
AT THE HOUSE.

55:25.147 --> 55:26.540
[horse whinnies]

56:00.008 --> 56:02.141
[click]

56:02.184 --> 56:03.011
TRY IT.

56:06.624 --> 56:07.712
- I CAN'T DO IT.

56:07.755 --> 56:09.278
- YES, YOU CAN.

56:09.322 --> 56:12.151
I CAN DO IT,

ALL RIGHT?

56:15.067 --> 56:17.461

DON'T PULL THAT BACK YET.

56:17.504 --> 56:19.332
ALL SET?

56:19.376 --> 56:22.204
JUST LINE IT UP
AND FOLLOW YOUR NOSE.

56:23.597 --> 56:26.383
HEY...NOT BAD
FOR AN L.A. GIRL.

56:32.606 --> 56:34.173
- DID YOU KNOW
THERE'S ACTUALLY A TERM NOW

56:34.216 --> 56:36.436

56:37.742 --> 56:39.439
- YEAH.

56:39.483 --> 56:40.962
IT'S HAPPENING MORE AND MORE.

56:41.006 --> 56:43.791
IN SOME STATES...
IT'S A CRIME,

56:43.835 --> 56:45.358
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT
TO PROSECUTE.

56:45.402 --> 56:46.751
AND IN OTHER STATES,

56:46.794 --> 56:47.839
THERE'S NOT EVEN
ANY LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

56:47.882 --> 56:51.059
- HOW ABOUT THIS STATE?

56:53.584 --> 56:55.324
- WELL, IT'S A MISDEMEANOR
TO DIVERT WATER

56:55.368 --> 56:57.370
FROM A TOWNSHIP'S PIPES,

56:57.414 --> 56:59.459
BUT NOT FROM
THE AQUIFER UNDERGROUND.

56:59.503 --> 57:01.026
- WELL, THEN,
IT'S NOT A CRIME.

57:01.069 --> 57:04.551
- NO...BUT SOMEONEMUST HAVE OFFICIAL PERMISSION

57:04.595 --> 57:07.554

I MEAN, IF I WERE BUYING
A PIECE OF PROPERTY,

57:11.253 --> 57:12.516
I'D WANT TO TEST FOR WATER.

57:12.559 --> 57:13.778
WOULDN'T YOU?

57:13.821 --> 57:15.649
THEN AGAIN,

57:48.639 --> 57:52.425
HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND
TILL YOU CROSS HIM.

57:52.469 --> 57:53.470
KIND OF LIKE RUTH HANSON.

THE ARGUMENT THE TWO OF YOU

58:20.932 --> 58:22.934
HAD OUT BY THE OLD
WATER TOWER YESTERDAY.

58:22.977 --> 58:26.285
- THE GOSSIP IN THIS TOWN
IS OFTEN MORE RIDICULOUS

58:26.328 --> 58:30.681
THAN IT IS RELIABLE.

58:30.724 --> 58:33.335
- HAVE A NICE DAY.

58:33.379 --> 58:35.337
- YOU TOO, DEAR.

58:38.123 --> 58:39.516
[door slams]

58:48.350 --> 58:50.396
[car engine starts]

58:57.011 --> 58:58.360
[starts engine]

59:12.200 --> 59:14.681
- WHY ARE YOU DRAGGING ME
OUT HERE?

59:14.725 --> 59:16.596
- WE GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE
SNOOPING AROUND.

59:16.640 --> 59:17.989
I'M PUTTING THAT FENCE UP
AROUND THAT HOLE.

59:18.032 --> 59:21.688
TOO MANY TRESPASSERS.

59:21.732 --> 59:24.256
- SO, UH, WE CLOSED THE DEAL
ON THE ROBINSON RANCH HERE

59:24.299 --> 59:26.040
AND THE COIL RANCH,

59:26.084 --> 59:27.955
AND THE PAPERWORK WILL BE DONEON THIS ONE LATER TODAY.

59:27.999 --> 59:29.957
- AND THAT'S THE ONLY
PIECE OF LAND NOW

59:30.001 --> 59:31.350
THAT'S STILL
STANDING IN MY WAY?

59:31.393 --> 59:33.178
- THE HANSON RANCH.

59:33.221 --> 59:35.746
- I DON'T THINK
MY MOM'S GONNA SELL.

59:35.789 --> 59:37.486
IT'S QUITE THE FENCE.

59:37.530 --> 59:38.749
BARBED WIRE.

59:38.792 --> 59:39.924
- WELL, IT KEEPS
COYOTES OUT.

59:39.967 --> 59:41.186
AND THE TRESPASSERS.

59:41.229 --> 59:42.361
I DO HATE VANDALISM.

59:42.404 --> 59:43.405
- OH.

59:43.449 --> 59:44.972
- KELLY.
- SAM.

59:45.016 --> 59:46.191
FUNNY MEETING YOU HERE.
SMALL WORLD.

59:46.234 --> 59:47.801
- SMALL TOWN.

59:47.845 --> 59:49.542
- KELLY GRANT,

59:49.586 --> 59:50.891
YOU'RE EVEN PRETTIER
IN PERSON.

59:50.935 --> 59:52.197
LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.764
- YOU'RE JACK NORRIS, JR.

59:53.807 --> 59:56.767
- IT'S AN HONOR.

59:56.810 --> 59:58.246
- AREN'T YOU, UH,

59:58.290 --> 59:59.770
JUMPING THE GUN A LITTLE
HERE ON THE FENCE?

59:59.813 --> 01:00:01.119
ESCROW HASN'T
EVEN CLOSED YET.

01:00:01.162 --> 01:00:02.773
- WELL, IT'S GOING TO,
ON FRIDAY.

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:03.948
A COUPLE DAYS.

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:06.907
- WHAT'S THIS?

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:07.995
- JUST CHECKING
THE GROUNDWATER.

01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:09.780
SEE HOW FAR IT GOES.

01:00:09.823 --> 01:00:12.652
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT THE MAYOR'S OKAY.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.785
- HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:16.569
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF WATER.
THE AQUIFER'S DRYING UP.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.136
- WELL, THAT JUST MEANS
WE GOTTA GO A LITTLE DEEPER,

01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:19.964
DOESN'T IT?

01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:20.791
- IS THAT ALL YOU'RE DOING?

01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:22.140
- [chuckles]

01:00:22.183 --> 01:00:24.577
KELLY GOT SOME CRAZY RUMOR

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.926
THAT YOU AND I
WERE FIGHTING YESTERDAY.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:27.667
- SAM...YOU'RE
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.017
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST
PRETEND TO BE NEUTRAL?

01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:31.628
YOUR CONSULTING
WITH MR. NORRIS

01:00:31.671 --> 01:00:33.499
COULD BE CONSTRUED
AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:34.848
- WELL, MY INTERESTS
ARE SOLELY

01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:36.720
FOR THE GOOD
OF THE COMMUNITY.

01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:38.765
- I'M SURE.

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.549
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
MAKE SOME TIME FOR ME

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:42.682
TO DO A SIT-DOWN INTERVIEW.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:45.076
I'M DOING A STORY
FOR THE PROSPER POST.

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.513
- ISN'T THAT THE PAPER
WHOSE OFFICE WAS DESTROYED?

01:00:47.556 --> 01:00:48.949
- YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

01:00:48.993 --> 01:00:51.604
PAPER HASN'T MISSED A DEADLINEIN 15 YEARS.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:52.910
- WELL, I LIKE YOUR SPIRIT.

01:00:52.953 --> 01:00:54.694
I'M GONNA MAKE
SOME TIME FOR YOU.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.653
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
- THANK YOU.

01:00:58.089 --> 01:01:00.004
- OH, UM...

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:02.049
ANY NEWS ON THAT
WATER DIVERSION BUSINESS?

01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:03.529
- OH, I'M STILL WAITING

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:05.226
ON THE REPORT
FROM THE ENGINEER.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.185
- OH. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN BUILDALL THE FENCES YOU WANT,

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:08.882
MR. NORRIS...

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:11.102
BUT I THINK THERE'S GONNA
BE SOME RED FACES

01:01:11.145 --> 01:01:12.451
WHEN THIS DEAL
GETS SHOT DOWN

01:01:12.494 --> 01:01:14.801
AT THE TOWN COUNCIL MEETING.

01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:16.411
- [chuckles]

01:01:16.455 --> 01:01:19.632
- I NEVER LIKED HER.

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:24.506
[horse whinnies]

01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:28.249
CHECK IT OUT, GRANDMA.

01:01:28.293 --> 01:01:30.687
BIG BEN ACTUALLY LIKES ME.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.689
- I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU.

01:01:38.912 --> 01:01:40.653
- GRANDMA.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:41.785
- YOU LIKE IT?

01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:43.134
- YEAH.

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:44.701
- HERE, I'LL TAKE THAT
FOR YOU.

01:01:51.098 --> 01:01:52.273
YOU EARNED IT.

01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:53.753
- HOW DOES IT LOOK?

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:55.755
- GREAT.

01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:56.843
HOW ABOUT YOU AND I
GO FOR A RIDE?

01:01:56.887 --> 01:01:57.931
- REALLY?

01:01:57.975 --> 01:01:59.759
- YEAH, LET'S GO.

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.544
I GOT SOMETHING
I WANNA SHOW YOU.

01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:19.561
HERE WE GO.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.132
- IS THAT LATIN?

01:02:25.176 --> 01:02:26.873
- SURE IS.

01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:30.181
"DE MORTIUS NIL NISI BONUM."

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:32.357
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
- COURSE NOT, GRANDMA.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.315
- DON'T SPEAK ILL
OF THE DEAD.

01:02:34.359 --> 01:02:37.144
THAT WAS YOUR GRANDPA'S IDEA.

01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:38.276
- WHO'S CARL?

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:40.321
- CARL WAS OUR SON.

01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:42.062
- I NEVER KNEW
YOU HAD A SON.

01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:44.021
- HE WAS STILLBORN.

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:46.371
THAT'S WHY YOUR MOTHER
WAS SO PRECIOUS TO US.

01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:48.765
I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.941
YOUR GRANDFATHER

01:02:50.984 --> 01:02:52.769
MADE ME PROMISE
ON HIS DEATHBED

01:02:52.812 --> 01:02:56.381
THAT I WOULD NEVER
SELL THIS RANCH.

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.339
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

01:02:58.383 --> 01:03:02.822
WITH GOD'S HAND GUIDING ME
AND A LOT OF ELBOW GREASE,

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:05.607
I WAS ABLE
TO KEEP MY PROMISE SO FAR.

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:08.959
I BET GRANDPA'S
REAL PROUD OF YOU.

01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:10.482
- [chuckles]

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:12.963
I HOPE SO.

01:03:13.006 --> 01:03:16.836
I FEEL HIM HERE,
WATCHING OVER THE PLACE.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.577
HE'S WITH ME ALL THE TIME.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:19.926
- WELL, I'M HERE TOO.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:21.754
AND I'LL HELP YOU.
I PROMISE.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.800
- OHH.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:24.931
OHH.

01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:27.064
I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE

01:03:27.107 --> 01:03:29.414
THAN FOR YOU TO TAKE OVER
THIS RANCH AS YOUR OWN.

01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:31.372
- ME TOO, GRANDMA.

01:03:31.416 --> 01:03:33.679
- OH HO.

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:37.030
[thunder crashing]

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:43.428
[horse grunts and snorts]

01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:44.821
- [sighs]

01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:47.040
- WHAT'S WRONG, GRANDMA?
- UH, NOTHING.

01:03:47.084 --> 01:03:49.347
JUST, UH,
SOMETHING IN MY EYE.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:52.219
IT'LL BE OKAY.

01:03:52.263 --> 01:03:54.004
WE BETTER GET BACK.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:55.353
IT SURE FEELS LIKE RAIN.

01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:57.659
[thunder crashes]

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:02.839

- STOP! AAH!

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:08.235

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:10.411
OH, MY--OH, MY GOD.

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:11.630
KAMILLA.

01:04:11.673 --> 01:04:14.241
KAMILLA.

01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:15.634
KAMILLA! KAMILLA!

01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:17.375

OH, MY GOD.

01:04:21.205 --> 01:04:22.249
WHY DID I...

01:04:22.293 --> 01:04:23.947
KAMILLA!

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:26.558

[thunder crashes]

01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:39.049
- OVER--OVER HERE!

01:04:39.092 --> 01:04:41.051
OVER HERE!

01:04:41.094 --> 01:04:42.922
OHH.

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:45.446
- MOM. MOM!- THANK GOODNESS THEY'RE HERE.

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.753
- OH, MY GOSH.
KAMILLA.

01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:51.670
- YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
- YOU'LL BE OKAY.

01:04:51.713 --> 01:04:52.976
- MOM?

01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:54.629
- OH, BABY.

01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:55.935
- I'LL GET HER UP.

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:57.241
- LET'S GET HER HOME.
- I GOT HER.

01:04:57.284 --> 01:04:59.939
Y'ALL GET THE DOOR.
I GOT HER.

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:01.898
YOU'LL BE OKAY.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:03.116
- HONEY.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.466
- I'M SORRY.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:09.035
- MOM,
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:10.950
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU
BEING THERE,

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:12.909
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:15.041
- IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,

01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:16.521
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:05:16.564 --> 01:05:20.264
- WHERE WERE YOU GOING?

01:05:20.307 --> 01:05:24.094
- I WANTED HER TO CONNECT
WITH HER GRANDPA.

01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:34.452
KELLY...

01:05:34.495 --> 01:05:35.932
I NEED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:37.107
WHEN KAMILLA FELL,

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:40.066
I COULDN'T SEE.

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:41.285
I COULDN'T SEE
A DARN THING.

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:42.939
[footsteps approaching]

01:05:42.982 --> 01:05:44.984
- WELL, PRETTY GOOD NEWS.

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:46.594
A SLIGHT CONCUSSION,
BRUISING.

01:05:46.638 --> 01:05:49.249
A BIT SHOOK UP, BUT OTHERWISESHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

01:05:49.293 --> 01:05:51.338
- OH...THANKS, DOC.

01:05:51.382 --> 01:05:53.688
CAN I GO SEE HER?
- ABSOLUTELY.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:03.002
KAMILLA IS GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:05.570
BUT YOUR MOTHER...

01:06:05.613 --> 01:06:07.833
IT STARTED
WITH HER NIGHT VISION.

01:06:07.876 --> 01:06:10.009
AND THEN HER
PERIPHERAL VISION.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:13.491
AND NOW...
IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER.

01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:15.188
THINK YOU BETTER
COME SEE ME.

01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:16.798
- I'LL BE IN THE OFFICE
IN THE MORNING.

01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:18.278
THANK YOU.

01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:19.845
- YEAH.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.172
- HEY.

01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:44.043
- HEY.

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:45.827
- IT'S A LONG NIGHT.

01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:49.744
- REMEMBER THE OTHER NIGHT

01:06:49.788 --> 01:06:51.311
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
TURNING BACK THE CLOCK?

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:54.401
- ACTUALLY...

01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:56.969
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO USED
THAT EXPRESSION, NOT ME.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:07:00.016
- WELL...

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:17.468
- WELL, THE SPECIALIST
SENT OVER THE RESULTS

01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:19.600
OF YOUR LATEST TEST, RUTH.

01:07:19.644 --> 01:07:21.472
I'M AFRAID THERE'S BEEN
FURTHER DEGENERATION.

01:07:21.515 --> 01:07:25.432
- OH, I COULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT.

01:07:25.476 --> 01:07:27.086
- ARE THERE ANY TREATMENTS
WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING?

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.045
- YES, THERE ARE TREATMENTS,
BUT THEY'RE RISKY.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:31.830
AND I'D RECOMMEND
USING A CANE.

01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:33.049
- I HATE CANES.

01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:38.402
- WELL...MY FATHER
MADE THIS ONE.

01:17:22.899 --> 01:17:23.987
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:25.641
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:27.381
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:17:31.211 --> 01:17:32.256
[clears throat]

01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:34.345
[scraping]

01:17:34.388 --> 01:17:35.868
[clang]

01:17:35.912 --> 01:17:38.654
[squeaking]

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:39.959
- HOLD THAT.

01:17:42.832 --> 01:17:43.833
[grunting]

01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:45.225
[clang]

01:17:45.269 --> 01:17:46.879
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE.

01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:50.404
HEY!

01:17:50.448 --> 01:17:52.015
[squeaking]

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:53.277
- WALT...DO YOU HEAR THAT?

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.321
- YEAH.

01:17:59.022 --> 01:17:59.892
- WHAT THE--

01:17:59.936 --> 01:18:00.980
[squeaking]

01:18:06.029 --> 01:18:08.031
- IS IT OPENING?

01:18:08.074 --> 01:18:09.510
- IT'S...STUCK!

01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:11.077
HEY!

01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:12.688
- HOW DO WE TURN THIS OFF?!

01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:14.994
- UHH!

01:18:15.038 --> 01:18:15.778
- HEY!

01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:21.131
- LOOKS LIKE THIS
IS THE ONLY OTHER WAY OUT!

01:18:21.174 --> 01:18:23.873
- YOU'RE RIGHT!

01:18:23.916 --> 01:18:25.439
I GOTTA CLIMB THAT POLE.

01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:31.097
UHH!
- [screams]

01:18:31.141 --> 01:18:32.533
- AAH!

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:37.625
- NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:39.845
- WELL...

01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:41.542
WE GOTTA WAIT.

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:46.809
WE'RE GONNA FLOAT...

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:48.071
TO THAT HATCH.

01:18:48.114 --> 01:18:51.117
- CHANGE IS COMING.

01:18:51.161 --> 01:18:53.903
PROGRESS...IT'S INEVITABLE.

01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:56.732
BUT CHANGE
IS NOT SOMETHING TO FEAR.

01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:59.735
CHANGE IS SOMETHING
TO EMBRACE!

01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:02.738
MY CASINO PROJECT
IS A MAMMOTH VENTURE.

01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:04.043
IT'S MY LIFE'S WORK,

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:05.741
AND I DO NOT
APPROACH IT LIGHTLY.

01:19:05.784 --> 01:19:07.351
AND, YES,
IT'S GONNA CAUSE CHANGE.

01:19:07.394 --> 01:19:08.874
IT'S CHANGE FOR THIS TOWN,

01:19:08.918 --> 01:19:11.703
CHANGE FOR EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.792
BUT WITH THAT CHANGE
WILL COME PROSPERITY,

01:19:13.836 --> 01:19:15.794
WHERE BEFORE,
THERE WAS NONE.

01:19:15.838 --> 01:19:17.883
AND WITH THAT CHANGE
WILL COME OPPORTUNITY

01:19:17.927 --> 01:19:20.320
FOR EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF YOU,

01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:21.887
AND THAT, MY FRIENDS,
IS NOT A GAMBLE.

01:19:21.931 --> 01:19:23.933
THAT...
IS MY PERSONAL GUARANTEE.

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:27.588
- GRAB IT!

01:19:30.156 --> 01:19:31.288
- WALT...

01:19:31.331 --> 01:19:33.159
- YEAH?

01:19:33.203 --> 01:19:35.771
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:37.294
- YEAH.

01:19:37.337 --> 01:19:38.817
I KNOW.

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:40.601
OKAY.

01:19:40.645 --> 01:19:43.082
[grunting]

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.214
[clanking and squeaking]

01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:45.955
GAH!

01:19:45.998 --> 01:19:46.956
UHH!

01:19:46.999 --> 01:19:49.175
OKAY.

01:19:49.219 --> 01:19:51.090
HYUH!

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:52.788
[grunting]

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:56.008
- NOW, TONIGHT,
I ASK THIS COUNCIL

01:19:56.052 --> 01:19:58.924
TO REITERATE ITS CONFIDENCE
IN OUR COLLECTIVE

01:19:58.968 --> 01:20:01.013
AND AUSPICIOUS FUTURE

01:20:01.057 --> 01:20:03.581
BY GIVING ITS UNANIMOUS
APPROVAL TO THIS DEAL.

01:20:03.624 --> 01:20:05.322
[approaching footsteps]

01:20:05.365 --> 01:20:06.323
I ASK YOU TO THINK
OF NORRIS PROPERTIES

01:20:06.366 --> 01:20:08.325
AS YOUR PARTNER--

01:20:08.368 --> 01:20:10.327
- WHAT ABOUT NEPTUNE?

01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:11.545
[overlapping chatter]

01:20:11.589 --> 01:20:13.373
- KELLY?
- MOM?

01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:16.028
- WELL, AS YOU KNOW, NEPTUNE
IS ANOTHER FIRM OF MINE

01:20:16.072 --> 01:20:18.814
INVESTING
IN NORRIS PROPERTIES,

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:20.859
INFRASTRUCTURE, ENGINEERING.

01:20:20.903 --> 01:20:23.035
- ENGINEERING?
THAT'S FOR SURE.

01:20:23.079 --> 01:20:24.341
ENGINEERING THE WATER
RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER US.

01:20:24.384 --> 01:20:25.733
- OH, MS. FARRADAY...

01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:27.431
- KELLY, YOU CAN'T JUST
COME IN HERE--

01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:29.215
- THIS MAN
IS THE REASON OUR FARMS

01:20:29.259 --> 01:20:30.564
AND OUR BUSINESSES
ARE FAILING.

01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:32.392
- DO I HAVE
TO HAVE YOU REMOVED?

01:20:32.436 --> 01:20:33.698
- YOU LAY A HAND
ON MY DAUGHTER,

01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:35.004
AND I'LL KICK YOUR BOTTOM.

01:20:35.047 --> 01:20:36.832
[audience gasps
and applauds]

01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:40.357
- QUIET DOWN, EVERYBODY.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.707
KELLY, YOU'LL
HAVE YOUR CHANCE TO SPEAK

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.143
ONCE MR. NORRIS IS FINISHED.

01:20:44.187 --> 01:20:48.191
MR. NORRIS,
WILL YOU PLEASE CONTINUE?

01:20:48.234 --> 01:20:49.801
- THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.848
I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS.

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:54.850
IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN PROGRESS,

01:20:54.893 --> 01:20:56.242
I KNOW
THE PEOPLE OF BIXFORD

01:20:56.286 --> 01:20:57.809
WOULD WELCOME
THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.245
FOR GROWTH AND PROSPERITY.

01:20:59.289 --> 01:21:00.856
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:01.900
I TRUST YOU WILL
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION.

01:21:01.944 --> 01:21:03.859
[applause]

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:09.647
- NOW, KELLY.

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.914
- MR. NORRIS IS RIGHT
ABOUT BIXFORD...

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:17.437
HIS BROTHER
BEING THE MAYOR AND ALL.

01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:19.004
[surprised chatter]

01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:22.094
BUT E TRUTH
IS THAT BIXFORD NEEDS WATER.

01:21:22.138 --> 01:21:24.009
AND OUR TOWN'S WATER TABLE

01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:26.272
IS THE LINCHPIN
TO THIS CASINO DEAL.

01:21:26.316 --> 01:21:28.492
MR. NORRIS'S COMPANY NEPTUNE

01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:30.189
HAS ALREADY BEGUN DIVERTING
PROSPER'S WATER TO BIXFORD.

01:21:30.233 --> 01:21:32.148
[all gasp]

01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:34.063
AND THAT IS THE REASON
WHY OUR WELLS ARE DRYING UP.

01:21:34.106 --> 01:21:35.803
MR. NORRIS IS A CRIMINAL,

01:21:35.847 --> 01:21:37.980
A-AND IF WE AGREE
TO HIS CASINO,

01:21:38.023 --> 01:21:39.938
THEN WE ARE PLAYING
RIGHT INTO HIS HAND

01:21:39.982 --> 01:21:41.722
AND UNDERMINING
OUR OWN COMMUNITY.

01:21:41.766 --> 01:21:43.376
- ALL RIGHT, NOW, KELLY,
THAT'S QUITE AN ACCUSATION.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.944
- MS. FARRADAY, THIS
IS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.293
- YEAH, I THINK WE'VE HEARD
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH FROM YOU.

01:21:47.337 --> 01:21:48.991
[gunshot]

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:50.906
- GRANDMA!

01:21:50.949 --> 01:21:53.952
- I AM A BLIND LADY
WITH A GUN.

01:21:53.996 --> 01:21:56.215
YOU JUST NEED TO SIT THERE,
BE QUIET,

01:21:56.259 --> 01:21:58.435
AND LISTEN TO WHAT
MY DAUGHTER HAS TO SAY.

01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:00.785
[laughter and chatter]

01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:06.617
- IT'S ALL TRUE.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.314
MR. NORRIS HAS BEEN
STEALING OUR WATER

01:22:08.358 --> 01:22:09.925
IN ORDER TO DRIVE US
OUT OF OUR HOMES

01:22:09.968 --> 01:22:10.926
AND MAKE WAY
FOR HIS CASINO.

01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:12.362
AND I HAVE THE PHOTOS

01:22:12.405 --> 01:22:14.146
AND THE WET CLOTHES
TO PROVE IT.

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:16.235
AND YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT ITIN TOMORROW'S POST.

01:22:16.279 --> 01:22:18.368
COMING BACK TO PROSPER
HAS MADE ME REALIZE

01:22:18.411 --> 01:22:22.981
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PRESERVE
THIS TOWN'S WAY OF LIFE.

01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:25.331
MY MOTHER'S
GREAT GRANDMOTHER,

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:27.333
THE INDOMITABLE
SHERIFF HELEN BARNES,

01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:29.335
ONCE SAVED THIS TOWN
FROM THIEVES.

01:22:29.379 --> 01:22:31.381
AND I ASK YOU ALL TO SAVE
THIS TOWN ONCE AGAIN.

01:22:31.424 --> 01:22:32.991
AND I ASK THE COUNCIL

01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:34.253
TO RESCIND THIS LAND DEAL
WITH MR. NORRIS.

01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:36.081
AND IF WE DON'T...

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:38.083
TOMORROW, ESCROW WILL CLOSE.

01:22:38.127 --> 01:22:41.260
AND OUR TOWN OF PROSPER,
AS WE KNOW IT...

01:22:41.304 --> 01:22:43.828
WILL BE HISTORY.

01:22:45.873 --> 01:22:47.963
MR. NORRIS, I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE A LITIGIOUS MAN,

01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:49.573
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU,
THE PEOPLE OF PROSPER

01:22:49.616 --> 01:22:51.314
WILL HOLD YOU
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE

01:22:51.357 --> 01:22:53.403
FOR THE LOSSES
THAT THEY HAVE INCURRED

01:22:53.446 --> 01:22:54.491
AS A RESULT
OF YOUR STEALING THEIR WATER

01:22:54.534 --> 01:22:57.015
FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GAIN.

01:22:57.059 --> 01:22:58.190
- I WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

01:22:58.234 --> 01:23:02.020
MS. FARRADAY, WELL PLAYED.

01:23:02.064 --> 01:23:04.414
[crowd chattering]

01:23:04.457 --> 01:23:05.981
- THEY'RE ALL ROTTEN.

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:07.895
- THIS IS OUR LIVES.
THIS IS OUR TOWN.

01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:09.375
- AND THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

01:23:09.419 --> 01:23:11.073
DOES THIS COUNCIL
REALIZE THAT...

01:23:11.116 --> 01:23:12.378
[door shuts]

01:23:12.422 --> 01:23:15.120
OUR MAYOR...
SAM BRIDGEWATER...

01:23:15.164 --> 01:23:16.556
IS ON THE PAYROLL
AT NEPTUNE?

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.210
[all gasp and chatter]

01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:20.038
SAM HAS BEEN GOING ALONG
WITH THE CASINO DEAL

01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:22.214
AND KNOWINGLY ASSISTINGIN THE DIVERSION OF OUR WATER.

01:23:22.258 --> 01:23:23.999
- I CAN EXPLAIN.

01:23:24.042 --> 01:23:25.217
- SHUT UP, SAM.

01:23:25.261 --> 01:23:26.827
[crowd chattering]

01:23:29.265 --> 01:23:31.049
- IN LIGHT OF THESE
NEW DEVELOPMENTS,

01:23:31.093 --> 01:23:34.052
I MOVE THAT WE...
TABLE THIS MOTION.

01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:35.967
AND THEREBY NULLIFY
THIS TRANSACTION

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.229
WITH NORRIS PROPERTIES.

01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:39.188
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR.

01:23:39.231 --> 01:23:41.233
all: AYE!

01:23:41.277 --> 01:23:42.539
- IT'S UNANIMOUS.
THE MOTION CARRIES.

01:23:42.582 --> 01:23:43.844
THE CASINO DEAL IS DEAD.

01:23:43.888 --> 01:23:46.021
[cheers and applause]

01:23:51.287 --> 01:23:53.071
- THIS MEETING
IS ADJOURNED.

01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:55.900
[applause]

01:24:09.479 --> 01:24:10.654
- SORRY I'M LATE.

01:24:10.697 --> 01:24:12.177
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:14.223
- [snorts]

01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:15.789
IT DIDN'T GO SO WELL.

01:24:19.706 --> 01:24:22.057
- WELL, GRANDMA RUTH GOT
YOU OUT BRANDING CATTLE YET?

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.362
- [laughs] NOT YET.

01:24:23.406 --> 01:24:25.277
- NO? SHE CAN DO IT.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

01:24:25.321 --> 01:24:27.236
- OH, YEAH.
- SHE'S A STRONG WOMAN.

01:24:27.279 --> 01:24:28.367

- HEY. READY TO GIVE YOU
AN ANSWER.

01:24:32.241 --> 01:24:34.069
- AND?

01:24:36.723 --> 01:24:38.203
- CAN I ASK WHY?

01:24:38.247 --> 01:24:40.118
- REDISCOVERING
WHAT I LEFT BEHIND.

01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:43.643
AND THE BEST THING TO EVER

01:24:43.687 --> 01:24:47.082
