00:29.440 --> 00:31.078
WHIT: Thank you. Thank you.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.714
But no, give yourselves a hand
because it was your hard work

00:33.880 --> 00:37.714
that gave Yardsham Inlet the best year
in the history of this agency.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.632
(CHEERING)

00:42.800 --> 00:45.268
Before we let all that success
go to our heads,

00:45.480 --> 00:48.517
we just thought we should get together
and reconnect with the fundamentals

00:48.680 --> 00:49.954
of what actually got us here.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.633
For that, I'm gonna turn it over

00:51.800 --> 00:54.633
to our resident
poet philosopher of product.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.319
The rebel command of brand.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.119
He's the guru
who terrifies Madison Avenue.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.268
(CHEERING)

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920

01:13.840 --> 01:15.831
- Yes!

01:17.160 --> 01:20.994
Oh. What is your "why"?

01:22.720 --> 01:25.029
Why did you even get out
of the bed this morning?

01:25.200 --> 01:27.191
Why did you eat what you ate?

01:27.360 --> 01:29.510
Why did you wear what you wore?

01:29.680 --> 01:31.875
Why did you come here?

01:32.040 --> 01:34.520
Other than the fact that
I would fire you and hire someone else

01:34.560 --> 01:36.198
if you didn't show up for work, but...

01:36.360 --> 01:38.191
- (LAUGHING)
- Not that. The big "why."

01:39.680 --> 01:42.797
We're certainly not here
to just sell shit.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.157
We are here

01:45.320 --> 01:46.878
to connect.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.510
Life is about people.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.478
Advertising is about illuminating

01:55.640 --> 01:58.518
how our products and services

01:58.720 --> 02:00.950
will improve people's lives.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.839
Now,

02:03.000 --> 02:04.718
how do we do that?

02:05.600 --> 02:06.999
Love.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.032
Time.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.073
Death.

02:12.360 --> 02:17.036
Now these three abstractions
connect every single human being on Earth.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.434
Everything that we covet,

02:18.600 --> 02:20.272
everything that we fear not having,

02:20.440 --> 02:23.113
everything that we ultimately
end up buying

02:23.280 --> 02:25.157
is because at the end of the day

02:25.840 --> 02:27.558
we long for love,

02:28.240 --> 02:30.071
we wish we had more time,

02:30.760 --> 02:32.830
and we fear death.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.914
Love.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.229
Time.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.113
Death.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.077
Let's begin there.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.158
How long did this one take?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.154
Five days.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.674
That's pretty impressive.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.160
- Maybe he came back too soon.
- Are you kidding me?

04:16.360 --> 04:18.396
It's been six months
of this zombie routine.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.760
We can't indulge this anymore.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.236
Especially because

04:22.400 --> 04:24.277
we're getting fired by Danworth Financial.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.510
- (COUGHS)
- CLAIRE: What? You're kidding me.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.816
- No, Whit, come on!
- I'm sorry, what?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.280
But I just talked to them yesterday.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.256
WHIT: I know. Everybody's been doing
their best to cover,

04:31.280 --> 04:33.748
but that entire account
is built on Howard's relationship.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.056
Half our billings are built
on Howard's relationships.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.256
This is a disaster. This is a disaster.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.508
No. Not yet.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.194
We have an offer from Omnicom
for $17 a share...

04:41.360 --> 04:42.576
- Oh, come on!
- ...but they want an answer

04:42.600 --> 04:43.953
- by New Year's.
- Shh.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.875
(BELL RINGS)

04:47.520 --> 04:49.875
(WHISPERING) Let's be honest,
we're not worth $14 a share

04:50.040 --> 04:51.320
if my partner takes a sabbatical

04:51.400 --> 04:53.197
as the local domino champion
of Crazy Town.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.480
That's a little harsh, Whit.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.517
WHIT: I'm sorry, but it's true.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.035
Simon, I am empowering you.
Go make the deal with Omnicom.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.989
I wish I could,
but Howard controls the voting shares.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.456
I'll deal with the Howard part, okay?

05:03.480 --> 05:04.674
Just push the papers, Simon.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.595
(FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)

05:06.760 --> 05:09.877
CLAIRE: I still don't understand
why Howard got 60% of the voting shares

05:10.080 --> 05:11.149
and you only got 40.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.595
Because I needed cash to settle my divorce

05:13.760 --> 05:16.718
and Howard did me a huge favor
and let me sell him some.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.072
So, if you never had an affair
with some junior creative,

05:21.240 --> 05:22.536
we wouldn't be in this situation?

05:22.560 --> 05:24.391
Inaccurate and unfair

05:24.560 --> 05:26.790
to put it squarely on my shoulders.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.394
- Well, I'm just pointing out the facts.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.359

05:36.560 --> 05:37.993

05:38.920 --> 05:41.150
Doesn't that remind you of your childhood?

05:42.640 --> 05:43.914
Claire, come here.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.512
Come on, I got to tell you something.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
What?

05:51.560 --> 05:54.279
I have been doing something
about our situation

05:54.440 --> 05:56.112
that you need to know about.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
What did you do?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.759
I hired someone.

05:58.960 --> 05:59.995
You hired someone?

06:00.280 --> 06:03.238
Yes. Look, when Eloise caught me cheating,

06:03.400 --> 06:06.949
she used a private investigator
named Sally Price.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.176
She's this woman
who looks like a Mormon grandmother,

06:09.200 --> 06:11.953
and it makes her very good
at the whole stealth thing.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.356
You hired the woman
who caused your divorce?

06:14.880 --> 06:16.552
No. I caused my divorce.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.154
Sally Price just documented it.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.274
Wow. That was actually enlightened.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.990
I have hidden depth. We've discussed this.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.634
So,

06:26.800 --> 06:28.438
why did you hire the Mormon grandmother?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.433
Because we need to document
what's going on with Howard.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.394
We need to show that
he's not mentally fit to vote his shares.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.154
No. We're not really
in that place where we're...

06:38.320 --> 06:41.437
We're actually gonna be the people
who would do that to a friend?

06:41.600 --> 06:42.749
It's not that he won't sell,

06:42.960 --> 06:47.317
it's that he won't even
have a conversation about selling.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.119
I try to talk to him, I try to reach him,

06:50.280 --> 06:52.760
and it's like I'm not even
in the same physical space with him.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.880
He's not there.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.996
His kid died.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.515
That was two years ago, Claire.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.994
What are we gonna...

07:00.160 --> 07:02.071
This is our lives at stake.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.080
We're not kids anymore.
You look me in the face

07:04.120 --> 07:06.496
and tell me that you're willing to have
everything you've worked for

07:06.520 --> 07:08.636
for the last 10 years just evaporate.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.519
Is this PI good?

07:14.680 --> 07:16.477
She caught me cheating.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.120
Oscar could have caught you cheating.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.679
Who the hell's Oscar?

07:19.840 --> 07:20.840
My son.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.996
Oh. (STAMMERING) That Oscar?

07:23.160 --> 07:25.160
This private investigator
isn't gonna find anything

07:25.200 --> 07:27.031
that'll pass for moral turpitude.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.871
(WHISPERING) Not on Howard,

07:30.040 --> 07:32.759
but if she can raise concern
regarding legal capacity,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.069
then we'll be in business.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.674
I do really think that
we are out of other options.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.673
You know, he terrorized
the grief counselor for six months.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.549
He totally blew off the Ayahuasca shaman
we flew in all the way from Peru.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.393
And our...
Our intervention was a disaster.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.834
I just...

07:48.720 --> 07:51.757
Look, uh, this doesn't feel right.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.799
I know.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.633
But when something starts
with a six-year-old dying,

07:56.800 --> 07:58.472

to get this cut.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.920
And just so you know,

it's a federal offense

- You could...
- Yeah.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.600
- Oh, not who.
- What do you mean?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.320
Howard doesn't write letters to people.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.799
He writes to things.

- Mmm... I like 20.
- I like 20 as well.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.240
Well, 20's just...
I don't know, it's a little steep.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.656
I'm like... I was thinking two.
These guys probably live in Brooklyn.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.336
- They pay 600 bucks a month.
- Stop talking. Just stop.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.536
You did a good job pulling them down.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.240
This is horrible.
This is completely wrong.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.114
No, Amy. This is the work. This is acting.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.520
Did you not hear them say
that this man's lost his child?

26:49.680 --> 26:53.150
Yes. And that's why he's reaching out
to the cosmos for answers.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.232
Well, we get to be that cosmos.

26:56.400 --> 27:00.518
Okay, so you want us to manipulate
this guy's pain so that, what?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.551
What, you cash out?
You make a lot of money?

27:03.040 --> 27:04.200
- SIMON: No!
- No, no, no, no!

27:04.280 --> 27:05.696
That doesn't sound good
when you put it that way.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.029
- It's a lot more complicated than that.
- Is it?

27:08.200 --> 27:09.235
CLAIRE: We love this man.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.636
And he's not just a boss, he's a friend.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.472
Howard is a brilliant,
creative, charismatic guy

27:15.880 --> 27:16.880
who used to be fearless.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.110
He used to love life,
and right now, he hates it.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.068
And you really think
that this is gonna help him?

27:22.280 --> 27:23.713
CLAIRE: He lost his child.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.908
And now he doesn't care
if he loses everything else.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.429
We just can't let that happen.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.272
We have to bring him back.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.228
$20,000's worth it.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.656
- (STAMMERING) I'll pay for it.
- Claire!

27:35.680 --> 27:37.910
I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it myself.
I don't care.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.238
So, what are the rules?

27:41.400 --> 27:44.233
Well, first, we'd have to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.256
And make sure
that you don't talk about it, 'cause...

27:46.280 --> 27:47.576
No, I don't mean the legal rules.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.397
I mean, the rules
of the theatrical device.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.513
I mean, do other people see us,
or only Howard?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.760
- Yeah, do other people see them, Whit?
- Whit?

27:56.920 --> 27:59.673
I guess... I guess only Howard.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.831
That's the effect
we're looking for, right?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.479
- Guess?
- You guess? I mean...

28:03.640 --> 28:05.280
I'm sorry, have you thought this through?

28:05.440 --> 28:06.793
- Sure. Sure.
- No.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.176
- I mean, to a degree.
- No, we haven't.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.555
No, we haven't, Whit. Shut up! Like...
We haven't.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.632
For instance, what if they go into a bar
and they want to order a drink?

28:13.800 --> 28:14.869
How can they do that if...

28:15.040 --> 28:16.936
Do you see Howard walking
into a lot of bars these days?

28:16.960 --> 28:18.188
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.016
- I mean, what if Howard goes clubbing?
- They're actors.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.838
- They need to know hypothetically.
- Okay. Okay. Enough. Enough.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.436
We have the power to be seen
by whomever we want, whenever we want.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.312
- How's that?
- I like that, I like that.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.136
- I told you they were good.
- I like that, yeah.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.440
We should just leave it to them.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.549
Let's move on.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.720
What's next?

28:33.880 --> 28:36.792
Well, Howard wrote three letters
to Love, Death and Time.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.997
So, I guess the only question is
who plays who?

28:40.160 --> 28:42.071
Casting. Very important.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.834
Love.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.599
Death.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.320
Time.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.629
Great. When do we get paid?

29:17.840 --> 29:21.150
BRIGITTE: "Dear Death,
you travel with so much mythology,

29:21.360 --> 29:24.352
"cause so much pain, inspire such fear.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.591
"But you're a paper tiger to me.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.877
"You're just pathetic
and powerless middle management.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.640
"You don't even have the authority
to make a simple trade."

29:32.800 --> 29:35.837
As you can see,
it's not exactly a fan letter.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.200
- Yeah, well, Death doesn't have any fans.
- (COUGHING)

29:38.240 --> 29:41.676
I don't understand why,
because it's a liberation.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.716
Hey, you okay?

29:44.920 --> 29:46.239
Mmm-mmm.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.190
CLAIRE: He goes to work, and the dog park.

29:58.600 --> 29:59.874
And that's it.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.553
Okay. So, here's how I'm gonna do it.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.199
I'm gonna come to him angry.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.550
Like, pissed off. Like, we got a problem.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.029
No, no, no. Don't do that.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.232
He's calling me wood and dead tissue.
He's calling me out.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.400
How's he calling you out?

30:12.560 --> 30:13.754
Time.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.832
He's calling out Time, and I'm Time.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.555
Look, I don't want
you antagonizing Howard.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.073
Do you get that?

30:37.320 --> 30:40.232
AMY: But the letter only consists
of one word, "Goodbye."

30:40.920 --> 30:41.920
Look.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.071
"Dear Love, goodbye."

30:44.400 --> 30:46.914
What am I even supposed to say to him?

30:47.160 --> 30:49.276
Um, it's...

30:50.600 --> 30:52.016
It's a letter to Love
saying goodbye, right?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.712
- Yeah.
- So, what if you approach him,

30:53.880 --> 30:55.393
and you refuse to accept that?

30:55.560 --> 30:57.835
You say he can't
get rid of you that easily.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.234
Tell him that

31:00.480 --> 31:04.234
we don't get to choose who we love
and who loves us back.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.956
Tell him that you're within him,

31:08.480 --> 31:12.029
you're within everything,
whether he likes it or not.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.271
And if he accepts that,

31:15.320 --> 31:18.153
then maybe... I don't know.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.915
Maybe he gets to find his life again.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.754
(DOG YIPPING)

32:14.240 --> 32:15.673
They grieve.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.078
Dogs.

32:19.240 --> 32:22.471
They grieve,
and they fully understand death.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.755
You called me a paper tiger.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.273
In the letter you wrote me.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.998
You said I was pathetic.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.869
Mmm.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.308
You don't remember?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.710
You went on about middle management,

32:38.880 --> 32:41.997
making a deal, paper tiger.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.153
Oh, Howard, it wasn't that long ago.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.476
Where did you get that?

32:49.880 --> 32:53.316
- Who are you?
- Who did you write the letter to?

32:54.200 --> 32:55.679
(CHUCKLES)

32:56.680 --> 32:58.159
I wrote the letter to Death.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.038
Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.314
No.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.240
I know, I know.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.550
People write letters
to the universe all the time.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.551
Most don't get a personal response.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.070
But you are, because I just wanted
to tell you that you're wrong.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.037
I'm not some powerless middle management

33:18.200 --> 33:19.520
- just following orders.
- Miss...

33:19.720 --> 33:22.075
You see, I didn't want to make
the trade. It was my call.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.231
I don't want this. I don't want this.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.040
Now, I don't tell you how to do your job.

33:26.120 --> 33:29.112
So, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell me how to do mine.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.634
Who's that man talking to?
He looks kind of weird.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.951
Don't worry about that.
Sometimes people are silly.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.714
You see, they don't see me
till it's their time.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.996
Oh, it's okay, Howard.
It's not your time yet.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.713
I just wanted to return this

33:44.160 --> 33:46.594
and clear things up between us.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.040
- I really am Death, Howard!
- (DOG YIPPING)

33:57.440 --> 33:58.440
He believed me.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.232
I'm telling you he believed me.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.834
- That's amazing.
- I mean, that was spectacular.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.616
Because there was no safety net, you see.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.040
That... That... That was Grotowski.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.634
- That was pure Stella Adler!
- Ah!

34:08.840 --> 34:10.800
- Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.
- Yes.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.016
- You are a kind man.
- Oh, not a problem.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.856
- He believed me, I'm telling you.
- I wouldn't go that far.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.096
But he needed it.
I could tell. I could tell in his eyes.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.416
Who was that woman and that little boy?
That was incredible.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.576
Oh, that was our private investigator
and her grandson.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.750
Oh, really?
And did she say anything about me?

34:22.920 --> 34:24.797
She said you were good.
She said really good.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.295
"Good"? What do you mean? Good like...

34:26.320 --> 34:28.436
You mean good like cabbage is good,
or what?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.636
No, no. She... (STAMMERS) Great.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.315
She said, she said,
"She made the impossible possible."

34:34.480 --> 34:36.835
- (CHUCKLES) I should be paying you.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

34:39.159 --> 34:42.469
They told me that Trevor had
packed his little suitcase,

34:42.679 --> 34:44.830
that he said he was going home.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.159
I was furious.

34:48.199 --> 34:51.829
But he was sleeping,
so I couldn't talk to him.

34:52.840 --> 34:57.630
I mean, what nurse promises
this dying five-year-old little boy

34:57.800 --> 34:59.438
he could go home?

35:00.320 --> 35:02.834
He barely had any white blood cells left.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.318
He was so fragile.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.631
And who could be so cruel?

35:09.600 --> 35:10.919
Who could do that?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.912
So, of course I'm frantic.

35:14.080 --> 35:18.471
I am shouting at the staff,
trying to get to the bottom of it.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.394
Well, Trevor finally wakes up

35:22.560 --> 35:24.755
and I go to him.

35:24.920 --> 35:31.029
You know, his little blue suitcase
was still at the edge of the bed, right.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.559
So, I look at him and ask,

35:35.640 --> 35:37.676
"Who said that to you, sweetie?

35:38.720 --> 35:41.393
"Who said that you could
come back to our house?"

35:42.000 --> 35:43.672
You know what he says?

35:45.080 --> 35:46.877
"Nobody, Mommy.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.954
"I'm not going back to our house.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.233
"I'm going home."

35:58.920 --> 36:02.435
He died four hours later.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.074
(DOOR OPENS)

(WOMAN SOBS)

36:18.520 --> 36:19.839
Hello.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.314
Hi.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.429
Are you looking
for Smallest Wings Support Group?

36:26.400 --> 36:27.913
Um...

36:28.960 --> 36:31.838
- Yes.
- And you are?

36:34.120 --> 36:37.078
- Um, Howard.
- Howard.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.510
Come on in. Have a seat.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.951
Did you lose a child, Howard?

36:55.640 --> 36:56.959
Yeah.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.633
- MADELINE: Boy or girl?
- Uh...

36:59.040 --> 37:00.109
A girl.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.479
And what was her name?

37:09.480 --> 37:11.675
No, it's okay. Howard.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.631
You don't have to answer.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.279
You don't even have to talk, okay?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.592
You stick around?

37:23.080 --> 37:24.308
Please?

37:30.080 --> 37:31.274
Okay.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.998
Thank you so much for sharing.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.548
We really appreciate it.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.720
Thank you.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.988
Does anybody have anything else
they'd like to say?

37:55.520 --> 37:58.512
- So, why'd you decide to come in tonight?
- Hmm?

37:59.160 --> 38:02.357
Yeah, I've... I've seen you outside.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.353
I was gonna come out one night
and invite you in,

38:05.520 --> 38:07.476
but I guess I didn't want
to blow up your spot.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.030
- Blow up my spot?
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:10.200 --> 38:12.191
- Yeah.
- You didn't want to mess up my jam?

38:12.360 --> 38:14.237
(CHUCKLES)

38:14.720 --> 38:16.153
Exactly.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.869
What's your name?

38:21.520 --> 38:22.589
I'm Madeline.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.758
Nice to meet you.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.032
My daughter's name was Olivia.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.755
She died of a rare form of brain cancer
known as Glioblastoma Multiforme,

38:31.920 --> 38:33.239
or GBM for short.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.152
She was six years old.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.917
What was your daughter's name, Howard?

38:46.080 --> 38:47.399
Okay.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.552
Fine. Don't answer.
I'm not gonna torture you.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.113
Thank you.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.794
- Was it the holidays?
- Mmm?

38:54.960 --> 38:56.871
Why you decided to come in tonight.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.838
We get a lot of first-timers
during the holidays.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.389
- No, that's not it.
- Then why tonight?

39:03.480 --> 39:05.914
Uh, I guess...

39:07.480 --> 39:08.480
I'm, uh...

39:09.840 --> 39:12.912
I'm trying to fix my mind.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.870
You lost a child, Howard.

39:17.640 --> 39:19.471
It'll never be fixed.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.951
I hope you come back.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.480
Hey.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.910
Signed contracts
and confidentiality agreements.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.355
- Oh, great. Thank you.
- So, did he say something?

40:19.560 --> 40:20.834
Who, Howard?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.761
- No. Unfortunately, he didn't.
- Oh, he believed it, I'm telling you.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.616
- Oh, that's good.
- Maybe you should send me in again.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.676
Not Raffi. Raffi's too impetuous.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.671
And Amy, she's just so emotional.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.512
After me, what is there?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.113
Well, he did write three letters.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.276
But Death is so much more vital than Time.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.954
- Right.
- Death gives Time all of its value.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.879
Maybe... Maybe I should
play all the parts.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.670
You know the highest margin demographic
is new parents now?

40:44.840 --> 40:46.320
Target actually invented an algorithm

40:46.480 --> 40:48.576
to predict when their female customers
were gonna get pregnant.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.875
You said before that you weren't okay.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.519
Are you sick?

40:55.960 --> 40:57.188
I'm sick.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.712
You could say, uh, I'm very sick.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.199
You're dying?

41:09.880 --> 41:11.199
Everyone's dying.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.196
Yeah, but you're doing it now.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.075
Simon. Simon.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.872
Come on, tell me. Tell me.
What is it? What's wrong?

41:26.040 --> 41:27.758
What's wrong?

41:27.960 --> 41:30.235
What's wrong is that
I came out of remission

41:30.400 --> 41:31.913
two weeks before my son was born.

41:32.520 --> 41:33.794
What's wrong

41:34.920 --> 41:37.520
is that I'm running a marathon every day
pretending to be healthy.

41:37.720 --> 41:38.948
That's what's wrong.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.313
Have you told anyone?

41:45.360 --> 41:46.554
You haven't?

41:46.960 --> 41:49.793
No, just some pushy actress
that I don't really know.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.436
What is it?

41:58.000 --> 41:59.149
It's multiple myeloma.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.710
I fought it when I was 16,
and then again when I was 25.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.195
It just never went away.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.954
Instead it regrouped and got stronger.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.191
So, the war's over?

42:18.280 --> 42:20.396
Yeah, war's over.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.874
Are your affairs in order?

42:25.680 --> 42:26.908
My affairs are not in order.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.477
That's why I hired you.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.640
It's bad enough that
I'm leaving my family.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.751
I'm not gonna leave them penniless.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.799
He believed me.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.675
Howard.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.149
He believed me.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.598
HOWARD: Hey. Excuse me.
No, don't touch that.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.313
I don't understand dominoes.

42:56.480 --> 42:59.836
There's no board to play them on,
or basket to throw them into.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.353
Right. Um...

43:01.520 --> 43:03.120
I think you might be in the wrong place.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.991
No, I'm in the right place, Howard.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.469
Mmm. Yeah.

43:12.120 --> 43:15.556
"Time, they say you heal all wounds,

43:15.720 --> 43:18.917
"but they don't talk about how you destroy
all that's good in the world.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.592
"How you turn beauty into ash."

43:22.760 --> 43:24.478
Now that's some bullshit, Howard.

43:24.960 --> 43:28.236
If Love is creation
and Death is destruction,

43:29.080 --> 43:31.310
I'm just a terrain in between.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.192
You don't understand Time.
No one understands Time.

43:35.360 --> 43:38.158
I mean, Einstein came close
when he said I was an illusion.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.514
CLAIRE: Howard? Hey. Uh...

43:39.720 --> 43:40.869
Listen, I'm sure it's a "no"

43:41.040 --> 43:44.032
but Oneida Apparel asked that
you be in the media buy meeting.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.918
I'm sorry to just barge in.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.793
Ask her.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.713
Go ahead. Ask her if she can see me.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.320
I'm not gonna be in the meeting.

44:05.720 --> 44:07.392
Mmm-hmm.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.754
Well, they insisted I ask.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.616
I mean, they're probably
gonna fire us, so...

44:10.640 --> 44:11.675
Okay.

44:11.840 --> 44:12.989
- Awesome.
- Yes.

44:13.160 --> 44:14.195
Okay.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.559
See you later.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.232
RAFFI: You can have this back, Howard.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.231
Why did you write me anyway?

44:23.400 --> 44:24.913
You wrote me because you need me.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.399
No. Um...

44:26.600 --> 44:28.397
I don't need anything from you, okay?

44:28.600 --> 44:30.636
You all like to bitch and complain.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.631
"There isn't enough time."

44:32.800 --> 44:34.677
"Life is short."

44:34.840 --> 44:36.910
"Oh, here, the gray hairs are coming in."

44:37.080 --> 44:38.911
You know, a day is long as hell.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.958
I'm abundant. I'm a gift.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.315
Even while you're
standing here talking shit,

44:44.480 --> 44:46.914
I'm gifting you, and you're wasting it.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.120
On what?

44:48.280 --> 44:49.952
I mean, what is this? Huh?

44:51.800 --> 44:53.279
Hey, hey!

44:53.600 --> 44:54.635
You know,

44:54.800 --> 44:57.268
I should be the one
that's writing angry letters.

45:05.800 --> 45:07.916
That was the worst thing I've ever done.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.076
That was the best thing I've ever done.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.073
What was that thing you said
about Einstein in there?

45:13.240 --> 45:16.630
Einstein called time
a stubbornly persistent illusion.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.239
What's that even mean?

45:19.560 --> 45:21.676
Time doesn't go from January to December,

45:21.840 --> 45:23.478
or from noon to midnight.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.915
You know, we all just make it that way
in our heads.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.793
That's absurd.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.758
Try telling that to a person
who's an hour late to a wedding

45:30.920 --> 45:34.708
or was just sentenced to 20 years in jail.
(SCOFFS)

45:35.040 --> 45:36.360
Or someone fighting a baby clock.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.988
We really don't need
to have this conversation, ever.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.317
Anyway, just...

45:45.480 --> 45:48.119
Yeah, wanted to say great job today.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.150
Just a stubborn illusion, Claire.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.992
You have all the time in the world.

45:53.640 --> 45:54.959
You're nine!

45:56.520 --> 45:57.839
"You're nine."

46:14.480 --> 46:15.480
Hi.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.431
I'm sorry.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.755
I'm so sorry.

46:25.280 --> 46:26.633
Um...

46:28.760 --> 46:30.955
You gotta be friggin' kidding me.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.473
I'm eating.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.878
You said goodbye, and that...

46:36.360 --> 46:40.399
(SIGHS) We don't get to choose
who we love or who loves us back.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.536
And that means you're powerless to me
as long as you're alive

46:43.560 --> 46:45.312
because I'm the fabric of life.

46:45.480 --> 46:48.074
I'm within you. I'm within everything.

46:48.800 --> 46:49.835
Howard,

46:50.640 --> 46:52.232
if you can accept that, then maybe...

46:52.400 --> 46:56.109
I don't know,
but maybe you get to live again.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.516
I completely screwed it up.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.479
I was weepy and apologetic.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.480
Well, I think love can be
weepy and apologetic.

47:20.600 --> 47:21.880
I think I was better at the end.

47:22.040 --> 47:24.634
Hey, hey. I'm sure you were great.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.399
You're sweet.

47:26.600 --> 47:27.600
Can I kiss you?

47:27.840 --> 47:29.398
You don't have to sexualize it.

47:29.640 --> 47:32.029
I can kiss you without sexualizing it.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.470
Seriously, I've had sex
without sexualizing it.

47:34.640 --> 47:36.437
You should take "sweet," Whit.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.194
It's a promotion.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.351
"Irresistible" would be a promotion.

47:42.320 --> 47:43.320
He believes it.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.833
How could you tell?

47:46.200 --> 47:47.758
I could tell by his eyes.

47:47.920 --> 47:50.912
That's great, but no one else has seen it

47:51.080 --> 47:53.040
and that's ultimately
what we need to have happen.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.271
We think if you would engage with him

47:56.440 --> 47:59.273
- one more time, um, in public.
- Great. Mmm-hmm.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.113
WHIT: But this time try to...

48:01.280 --> 48:03.794
SIMON: But you need to provoke
a strong visible reaction.

48:03.960 --> 48:04.960
Why?

48:05.160 --> 48:08.118
Because our private investigator's
gonna capture it on video.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.456
And we're gonna use it as evidence.

48:09.480 --> 48:10.720
It'll be like being in a movie.

48:11.800 --> 48:13.200
Except you'll be digitally removed.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.920
No.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
Sorry?

48:16.480 --> 48:17.629
This is too intense.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.456
Um, I'm sorry. I can't be a part of this.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.313
Amy, there is no "too intense" in acting.

48:22.480 --> 48:25.552
Do you wanna be loved
or do you wanna make an impact?

48:25.720 --> 48:28.154
I mean, this isn't Noël Coward.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.753
This is... This is Chekhov.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.148
This is horrible!

48:31.640 --> 48:34.438
The... You know,

48:34.640 --> 48:37.791
you did start the agency
with him, didn't you, Whit?

48:37.960 --> 48:39.393
And, Claire, he was your mentor.

48:39.600 --> 48:42.273
And, Simon, he gave you part
ownership in a business

48:42.480 --> 48:44.072
when he absolutely didn't have to.

48:44.240 --> 48:45.976
- I may have told her a few things...
- Mmm-hmm.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.200
- ...when we were...
- Mmm-hmm.

48:47.360 --> 48:48.680
AMY: I'm sorry, this is horrible.

48:48.840 --> 48:50.976
I... I can't...
No, I can't be a part of this. Thank you.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.040
- Sorry. Thanks.
- Amy, no.

48:52.160 --> 48:53.195
Amy.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.360
Amy. No.

48:54.520 --> 48:55.880
Oh, she's so passionate, you know.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Amy!

48:57.360 --> 48:59.112
I'm so sorry. She will be back.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.271
But if she isn't, um,

49:01.440 --> 49:04.512
I'll step in. I do know all about love.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.194
Amy!

49:13.840 --> 49:14.955
What'd I miss?

49:17.480 --> 49:19.550
People crying because their kids died.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.756
Hmm. Uh...

49:22.920 --> 49:27.038
Uh, there's a thing called
bereavement hallucinations.

49:27.360 --> 49:28.360
Yes.

49:28.560 --> 49:29.754
Right. Um. Okay.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.349
So, uh...

49:32.560 --> 49:34.118
I looked them up.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.788
And here's the thing. I don't sleep.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Okay.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.077
(STAMMERING) Like, not a lot.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.719
I mean, I sleep.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.549
Mmm.

49:44.400 --> 49:48.712
But I get six or seven hours a week.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.196
Now that I think about it,
that's probably why...

49:51.360 --> 49:52.360
Why what?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.194
Um...

49:55.240 --> 49:56.514
(SIGHS)

49:58.760 --> 50:02.070
I'm having conversations.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.559
Mmm-hmm.

50:07.440 --> 50:10.159
I mean, conversations.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.239
Okay.

50:15.040 --> 50:17.838
It's okay. Never mind. Um...

50:18.200 --> 50:20.270
- Howard?
- Yeah.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.951
You wanna have a conversation with me?

50:24.560 --> 50:26.039
Uh, yes.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.592
So, I assume you're a part of the 79%?

50:32.920 --> 50:33.955
Mmm?

50:34.200 --> 50:38.034
Of couples who get divorced
after losing a child.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.992
Yeah.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.240
Mmm.

50:41.440 --> 50:42.793
Yeah, me too.

50:45.560 --> 50:46.959
Do you still love her?

50:49.640 --> 50:52.108
I don't even know what love is anymore.

50:53.440 --> 50:55.112
Do you still love him?

50:55.320 --> 50:57.038
We never fell out of love.

50:57.880 --> 51:00.155
At least, I don't think so. It's just...

51:01.280 --> 51:02.429
We can...

51:03.160 --> 51:04.354
(SIGHS)

51:08.280 --> 51:12.637
The day our divorce was final,
he sent me this.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.913
"If only we could be strangers again."

51:22.160 --> 51:23.752
Now we are.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.709
The most romantic gesture he ever made.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.230
So, to answer your question,

51:31.760 --> 51:32.909
yes,

51:33.080 --> 51:34.513
I still love him.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.758
What did you mean

51:44.920 --> 51:46.616
when you said
you were having conversations?

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:47.800 --> 51:49.756
- Conversations with who?
- Um...

51:50.600 --> 51:51.953
It's not "who."

51:52.120 --> 51:53.348
It's really... It's...

51:53.520 --> 51:55.511
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.680
Try me.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.996
Um, can I show you?

51:59.720 --> 52:03.349
MADELINE: "Dead tissue
that won't decompose."

52:04.480 --> 52:06.471
He was sitting right here.

52:06.680 --> 52:11.037
Just a mean, little, arrogant thug.

52:11.760 --> 52:14.672
And he was the first one
that appeared, right?

52:15.040 --> 52:17.031
Uh, no. Death came first.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.953
She met me in the dog park.

52:20.760 --> 52:22.478
Oh, so Death is a "her"?

52:22.840 --> 52:27.118
Uh, yeah. It turns out
Death is an elderly white woman.

52:29.040 --> 52:30.393
What was the trade?

52:31.240 --> 52:33.754
You said Death wouldn't make the trade.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
What does that mean?

52:35.400 --> 52:37.197
When we realized our...

52:37.880 --> 52:41.839
My daughter was dying, I prayed, uh...

52:43.080 --> 52:47.039
Not to God or the universe, but to Death.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.918
I offered a trade.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.752
Take me,

52:50.920 --> 52:52.592
leave my daughter.

52:55.160 --> 52:59.073
But she didn't wanna make the trade, so...

53:17.560 --> 53:19.278
BRIGITTE: So, who won that round?

53:20.560 --> 53:22.357
You or the porcelain?

53:22.520 --> 53:25.432
(CHUCKLES) Porcelain.
Porcelain's undefeated.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.754
I'm sorry about that,
I thought everyone left.

53:29.920 --> 53:32.115
Yes, they did. But I'm here to close up.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.315
SIMON: Good.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.600
You need help getting home?

53:34.960 --> 53:36.473
No. I'm fine.

53:36.920 --> 53:38.592
I'm... I'm good.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.388
I Googled you.

53:41.600 --> 53:42.600
- You did?
- Yeah.

53:42.760 --> 53:43.760
(WHISPERS) Oh, God.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.791
You came from nothing.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.636
You put yourself through Duke,

53:49.120 --> 53:51.156
you married a wonderful woman,

53:51.320 --> 53:52.594
you're a loving father.

53:52.760 --> 53:54.990
So, you lived well. You lived right.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.468
But, my friend, you're not dying right.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.797
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

54:03.000 --> 54:04.638
Are you gonna tell me how to die?

54:04.840 --> 54:06.353
Have you told your family yet?

54:08.480 --> 54:10.675
- Mmm-mmm.
- You're not helping them.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.753
You're just denying them
what is rightfully theirs.

54:13.920 --> 54:15.239
Yeah? And what's that?

54:15.400 --> 54:17.914
Pain? Atrophy? Disease?

54:18.080 --> 54:19.513
Yes. Yes.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.159
All of it.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.988
And the chance to say goodbye.

54:27.600 --> 54:28.669
Stick to acting.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.753
MADELINE: Okay.

54:37.960 --> 54:40.633
I have something
that I haven't told anyone.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.676
It doesn't involve letters
or angels or anything like that,

54:45.880 --> 54:47.154
but it means something to me.

54:50.840 --> 54:56.233
They were preparing Olivia to say goodbye.

54:57.160 --> 55:01.233
And my husband was trying to
calm my mother in the parking lot

55:01.440 --> 55:03.237
because she lost it.

55:05.040 --> 55:06.837
So I was alone

55:07.760 --> 55:10.672
and I was sitting there
in the waiting room

55:10.840 --> 55:12.796
at Maimonides Hospital.

55:13.960 --> 55:16.872
And there was this woman
who sat next to me.

55:19.120 --> 55:21.793
And she asked me who I was about to lose.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.752
And I told her.

55:25.360 --> 55:27.396
And she looked at me and she said,

55:29.320 --> 55:31.914
"Just be sure to notice

55:32.080 --> 55:34.230
"the collateral beauty."

55:37.000 --> 55:38.035
I mean, she...

55:38.480 --> 55:41.074
She said it so casually.

55:43.240 --> 55:44.992
In the next room,

55:45.720 --> 55:49.235
my six-year-old daughter
was being taken off life support.

55:51.040 --> 55:53.873
And this woman says "collateral beauty."

55:55.760 --> 55:59.514
People don't know
what to say in those moments.

55:59.680 --> 56:02.433
No, she did.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.155
I just didn't get it at the time.

56:05.880 --> 56:08.997
See, it wasn't said out of
sympathy or awkwardness.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.515
It was from experience.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.312
About a year later,

56:17.560 --> 56:19.949
something started to
happen to me, you know.

56:20.240 --> 56:22.993
I would be walking
or on the subway, whatever,

56:23.160 --> 56:25.720
and I would just burst into tears.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.598
But these weren't Olivia tears.

56:29.760 --> 56:32.718
These were tears born from something else,

56:36.000 --> 56:41.120
from this kind of profound
connection to everything.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.513
And I realized

56:45.880 --> 56:49.270
it was the collateral beauty.

56:52.480 --> 56:53.833
I mean, there's...

56:54.920 --> 56:58.151
There's no such thing
as collateral beauty.

56:58.320 --> 56:59.958
There is, Howard.

57:01.040 --> 57:02.678
There really is.

57:04.600 --> 57:06.670
It'll never bring her back.

57:07.080 --> 57:12.677
And it will never ever make it okay.

57:14.880 --> 57:18.919
But I promise you, it's there.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.033
Okay.

57:28.920 --> 57:30.990
You need to talk to them, Howard.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.354
Look, um...

57:33.320 --> 57:34.320
Appreciate your story,

57:34.480 --> 57:37.358
but I'm not really feeling
the "collateral beauty" thing.

57:37.520 --> 57:38.839
I don't care!

57:39.800 --> 57:42.997
Yell at them,
reason with them, challenge them.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.991
Just engage!

57:46.960 --> 57:48.188
(SIGHS)

57:56.800 --> 57:58.870
I think this was a mistake.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.068
- Hi.
- WHIT: Hi.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.117
What're you doing here?

58:18.280 --> 58:21.158
Uh, Brigitte told me this is
where I could find you.

58:21.320 --> 58:22.548
Of course she did.

58:23.600 --> 58:26.592
Could we just go and talk somewhere
for 15 minutes by ourselves?

58:26.760 --> 58:28.880
I'm... I'm actually working.
I'm rehearsing right now.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.638
- You're rehearsing here, too?
- Yeah.

58:30.800 --> 58:32.720
How many projects
are you doing at the same time?

58:33.280 --> 58:34.508
I'm currently doing three.

58:34.720 --> 58:35.720
Three. Wow.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.040
- Yeah.
- That's really busy.

58:37.200 --> 58:38.720
How are we gonna fit a dinner date in?

58:38.760 --> 58:39.760
Whit...

58:40.000 --> 58:42.116
Listen, listen, listen. Seriously...

58:42.280 --> 58:47.195
I have to ask you
to reconsider what you said last night.

58:47.640 --> 58:50.154
(STAMMERS) We need you one more time.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.639
Just give us one more scene.

58:51.840 --> 58:53.478
I am out.

58:53.640 --> 58:54.640
Amy, what do you...

58:54.840 --> 58:56.280
Wait, what can I say? What do you...

58:56.920 --> 58:59.150
I'll give you $100,000. Not 20, 100.

58:59.320 --> 59:00.912
You don't have $100,000.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.520
You're right. I live with my mother.

59:02.680 --> 59:05.360
But this is gonna work, and when it does,
I'll have much, much more.

59:05.520 --> 59:06.640
And I'll give you a million.

59:06.720 --> 59:08.400
- I don't want your money.
- I really will.

59:08.480 --> 59:09.480
I do not want your money.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.640
Do you know,
I've actually never wanted your money.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.718
What can I say to get you to do this?

59:14.880 --> 59:17.792
Because there's so much more
at stake here, you have no idea.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.274
Oh.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.592
You have a daughter, right?

59:21.760 --> 59:22.988
Yeah.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.519
Did we talk about that?

59:25.480 --> 59:28.278
Tell me what it was like
the day that she was born.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.555
What?

59:29.720 --> 59:31.756
What it felt like for you.

59:32.600 --> 59:34.830
Uh, it was scary.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.236
It was very scary. I was terrified.

59:40.400 --> 59:42.277
But then they gave her to me

59:42.440 --> 59:46.433
and I had the most amazing
sensation run through me.

59:48.880 --> 59:51.713
It... I can't...

59:51.960 --> 59:53.109
What? Finish it.

59:53.280 --> 59:55.191
It sounds... It's goofy.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.628
No, it doesn't sound goofy.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.696
Do you know, actually,
this is the first time that I felt

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.312
any attraction towards you, whatsoever.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.913
- Really?
- Yes.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.837
I looked at her and I...

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.709
I realized that I wasn't feeling love.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.597
I had become love.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.114
She doesn't talk to me now, though.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.875
She blames me for the divorce,
and so she's angry at me.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.269
And...

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.469
I deserve it.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.351
I'm gonna make you a deal.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.672
If you can take all of this,

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.630
frankly, aggressive determination

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.749
and extraordinary openness

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.792
and use it on winning your daughter back,

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.880
then I'll do it.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.553
It's a deal.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.954
See, you don't feel that?

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.112
Oh, wow. Give me my hand back.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.716
You feel that though, right?
You feel it?

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.136
- That's sparks.
- Goodbye, Whit.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.160
That's what that is.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.870
Hey! What's up?

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.871
- What?
- You got something to say?

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.633
You got something you wanna say?

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.856
Oh, yeah. I got a lot of things
I'd like to say to you.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.996
Well, say it. Say it!

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.472
See, you just waste time.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.636
See, I give you a gift
and you just waste it!

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.120
I don't care about time.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.158
This is a prison sentence!

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.715
I don't want your gift!

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.310
Because you took hers.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.879
Oh, come on.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.559
Are you here to take me?

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.558
No, Howard.
I'm here to ride the F train with you.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040
Oh, okay.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.512
So, there are these two twins
in a womb, a boy and a girl.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.908
You telling a joke?

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.513
No, no. It's a story.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.193
So, these twins are happy.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.595
They're fed, they're warm, they feel safe.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.751
But they're outgrowing their space

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.113
and they realize this can't go on forever.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.872
So they start thinking,

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.431
"What comes next?

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.239
"What if it's cold or lonely?

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.594
"What if we're not together?

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.919
"What if there's nothing at all?"

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.548
So, then the girl looks at the cord.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.069
This cord that has fed them,
has nourished them,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.629
this cord that they
can't possibly conceive

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.109
could be attached to anything else.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.759
And she says,

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.559
"Well, we have no proof.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.073
"All we have is this."

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440
No.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.439
Wow, that's deep.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.319
So, it's like life after birth.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.234
Hopeful.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.313
All right, what do you want?

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.553
Why are you here?

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.631
I've heard all of your platitudes.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.949
I got them, I know.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.473
"She's in a better place."

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.438
And, "This is all
a part of a master plan."

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.749
Heard that one, too.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.109
Here's my favorite.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.750
"God looked down and
saw the most beautiful rose,

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.797
"so beautiful that he picked it

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.679
"to have it in Heaven all for Himself."

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.116
Then there's the science, biocentrism,

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.636
and we're all living and dying
in infinite universes

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.472
all at the same time.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.755
And then the religion,

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.672
the Christians and their salvation,

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.310
and the Buddhists and their Samsara,
and the Hindus and their 41 st sacrament.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.959
And can't forget the poetry.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.519
Oh, the poetry.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.672
"To die is different
from what anyone supposed

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.034
"and luckier."

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.315
Whitman.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.630
And, "Rage...

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.597
"Rage against the dying of the light.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.760
Yo!

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.080
I can't believe you made me
come into this neighborhood

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.276
carrying $20,000 in cash.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.313
What are you gonna do with it?

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.311
You should put it aside for acting school.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.674
You were really good.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.116
Mmm. I'm gonna use it
to buy designer drugs.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.998
Or that, too.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.229
Yeah.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.398
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.309
Hey, you gonna make a good mom one day.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.834
Yeah?

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.998
Yeah, well,
that's pretty much not in the cards.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.390
I decided against the science

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.111
and it seems time
finally caught up with me.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.719
There was this dust dealer up on
187th who gave me Brave New World.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.429
That book turned hours into seconds.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.272
He was my father.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.919
And there was this homeless woman

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.150
who lived under
the University Heights bridge.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.469
Her name was Flora.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.036
She was batshit crazy,
but she told me the greatest stories.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.440
She was my mother.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.519
See, Claire,

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.830
your children don't have to come from you.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.558
They go through you.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.670
So, I wouldn't consider
the battle with time over just yet.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:05.559
I thought time wasn't linear.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.119
I thought it was an illusion.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.712
(SIGHS) Maybe
that was just bullshit, Claire.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.831
Maybe that was just acting. (CHUCKLES)

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.269
- WHIT: Hey, Allison.
- Come on, let's go.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.558
Oh. Come on. Allison!

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.593
I'll meet you guys there.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.116
I don't wanna talk to you. You know that.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.360
Leave me alone.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.748
No. I won't leave you alone.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.194
- No?
- No.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.755
I know you're angry at me,
and that's okay.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960
I can take it.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:08.590
But we gotta talk about it
because that's what you do in a family.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.270
So I'm gonna come here every day
and embarrass you in front of your friends

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.475
until you talk to me.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.074
So you're gonna stalk me?

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.952
Well... Yes, basically.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.416
Well, what if I get a restraining order?

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.096
Well, I don't think you're
gonna be able to do that.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.473
Well, I'll get Mom to pay for it.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.471
Well, for your information, they're free.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.278
Well, then I'll get you to pay for it.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.394
I really love you.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.438
Mom says you butcher that word.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.398
Not when I say it to you.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.353
Look...

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.478
I can't fly you to Maine for lunch

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.074
or get you picked up in a Tesla

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.470
and take you to your internship
with Anna Wintour

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.915
or whatever the hell
they do in this neighborhood.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.473
(INHALES SHARPLY)

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.989
But I think that you and me
can sit on a park bench

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.071
and tell jokes
and have a pretty good time.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.510
(SIGHS) I can't believe
you're gonna stalk me.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.714
But, um...

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.995
Just so you know, tomorrow's a half-day.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.992
Well, I'll be here then.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.989
Hey.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.553
Here you are.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.239
I've been waiting a long time
for my moment for validation,

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.549
and this was it.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.269
An audience of one,
in secret, with no applause.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.199
(CHUCKLES)

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.039
(COUGHS)

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.760
I told my wife.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.719
Oh, how did it go?

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.314
She knew.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.356
She's getting ready for it.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.713
You know, when I was younger,
I used to think,

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.551
you really wanna live to be 100 years old?

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.071
You know, like a shriveled up raisin.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.552
And the answer to that now

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.799
is yes.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.351
Because my son would be 70,

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.593
his son would be 40,

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.557
and his son would be 10.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.390
And I would be the man, you know.

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.319
Pops.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.756
(SIGHS) Could get used to that, you know.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.510
See you around, Pops.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.276
I wish I could be here to see the play.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.953
Oh, no, no.
The play is dead after all this.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.757
But you never know,

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.037
nothing's ever really dead
if you look at it right.

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.198
(DOORBELL RINGS)

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.708
Hey.

Hey.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:50.719
Uh, it's Christmas Eve.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.839
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.197
And you're alone.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.520
By choice.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.996
Can I ruin that?

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.992
You've been crying.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.038
I was watching a video
I took of my daughter.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.911
She's dancing with her father in it.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.830
Can I show it to you, Howard?

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.232
My daughter's name was Olivia.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.956
She died of a rare form of brain cancer

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.953
known as Glioblastoma Multiforme,

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.111
or GBM for short.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.597
She was six years old.

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.719
What was your daughter's name, Howard?

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.752
"If only we could be strangers again."

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.959
I can't.

I... I can't.
