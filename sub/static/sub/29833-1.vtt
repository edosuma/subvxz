WEBVTT

00:31.727 --> 00:32.945
- Let's do this.

00:47.438 --> 00:49.353
- Let's see what we got here.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.963
The fuck is this?

02:40.508 --> 02:43.772
- In this business, there
is no room for mistakes.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.471
Any wrong turn,

02:47.558 --> 02:50.561
and innocent people
can pay the price.

02:50.648 --> 02:53.260
These streets and five tasks

02:53.347 --> 02:55.175
stand between me
and seeing my son again.

02:55.262 --> 02:59.614
- Get the money and find
the guns, or I'm a dead man.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.050
- We're on it, Jimmie.

04:22.218 --> 04:24.046
- Hey, you! Stop!

04:55.512 --> 04:57.645
- David?

04:57.732 --> 04:59.734
- We still good to meet?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.605
- I can't talk right now.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.086
I'm, um--

05:04.173 --> 05:05.740
I'm busy.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.655
- I'll meet you at our spot.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.128
- Rhona.

05:49.697 --> 05:52.482
- Can I get you anything?

05:52.569 --> 05:55.920
- Water, coffee, and privacy.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.226
- Sure thing.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.711
- She's, uh--
she's not eating?

06:03.798 --> 06:06.670
- No, she's just
taking up a table.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.203
- Anything else?

06:18.290 --> 06:20.205
- Privacy.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.729
- That'll be 3.50.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.215
- I was never here.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.174
- Refills on me.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.627
- Enjoying your coffee?

06:55.763 --> 06:57.504
- I wanna speak to my son.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.810
- Not the agreement.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.899
- We made an agreement?

07:01.986 --> 07:03.814
- Complete all your assignments,
you not only

07:03.901 --> 07:06.730
get to speak to him, you'll have
the pleasure of holding him.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.253
- How do I know--

07:10.995 --> 07:13.607
How do I know you
haven't already killed him?

07:13.694 --> 07:15.783
- You don't.

07:57.128 --> 08:00.828
- Fuck.
This place is dangerous.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.091
- Buck up.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.748
Where the hell is Richie?

08:07.835 --> 08:10.402
- Well, Richie is--

08:10.490 --> 08:13.797
Richie's late,
but he'll be here.

08:13.884 --> 08:18.585
- If you two fuck this up,
this won't end well.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.022
Understood?

08:21.109 --> 08:23.851
- Yeah.
Yeah, I understand.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.290
- Good.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.773
I need this money
to get Mika out of here.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.036
- You must love your son.

08:36.254 --> 08:39.040
- Yeah, I do.
Imagine that.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.782
- There's Richie right there.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.001
Told you.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.095
- Stay in the fucking car.

08:51.182 --> 08:54.403
I'm serious, not a sound.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.798
Richie, you're late.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.106
Let's do this.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.652
- He wants to see the money.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.001
- Let's see the product first.

09:38.490 --> 09:41.668
- What's wrong with you?
Are you high?

09:41.755 --> 09:43.234
- No!

09:43.321 --> 09:44.758
Let's do this.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.415
- Just show it to him, okay?

09:54.071 --> 09:56.683
Look, just--just get the bag
and show him the money.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.162
Richie!

10:01.035 --> 10:02.123
- Tell him to get on the ground!

10:02.210 --> 10:03.559
- What the hell is happening?

10:03.646 --> 10:04.995
Wait, what the hell
are you doing?

10:05.082 --> 10:05.953
- Get on the ground!

10:06.040 --> 10:06.867
- No, what are you--

10:14.614 --> 10:17.051
- I know you said
you weren't here,

10:17.138 --> 10:19.575
but, uh, the coffee cup is.

10:19.662 --> 10:24.580
I'll probably regret asking
this, but are you all right?

10:24.667 --> 10:27.539
- Allergies.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.543
- I don't know their names,
but they're not worth it.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.025
You'd best go it alone, they
give you any difficulty at all.

10:35.112 --> 10:38.725
- They won't see
the next sunrise.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.254
- Evening, Betty.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.909
Well, it's a quiet one
at that, isn't it?

10:48.996 --> 10:51.694
- Your powers of observation
are astounding.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.262
- How's the yellow-white
pie tonight, it's good?

10:54.349 --> 10:56.046
- Yeah, the lemon
meringue's fresh.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.919
- Good. Gimme a slice?

10:59.006 --> 11:02.096
Actually, Betty,
make it two, will ya?

11:08.755 --> 11:10.017
- Kane.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.719
- That's your car out front.
Am I right?

11:16.806 --> 11:18.590
- It is tonight.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.157
- Here you go.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.465
- Oh, Betty, you're a queen.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.772
Beautiful, thank you, sweetie.
- Thank you.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.730
- You're gonna love this.

11:27.817 --> 11:31.038
This--this is another level.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.606
That's beautiful.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.045
You know, it always tastes
exactly the same, too.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.874
They call that "integrity."

11:40.961 --> 11:45.617
It's like the recipe never
wavers, not once, you know?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.358
It's always the same.

11:47.445 --> 11:50.144
It's the culinary equivalent
of loyalty, I guess.

11:50.231 --> 11:53.103
It's like all
the ingredients

11:53.190 --> 11:56.063
show up every single time
they're called,

11:56.150 --> 11:58.326
in exactly the right amounts.

11:58.413 --> 12:03.723
That's what makes it
so pure and perfect.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.159
You know what I mean?

12:05.246 --> 12:06.551
It's beautiful, right?

12:08.466 --> 12:11.513
What's the matter, Rhona,
you don't--you don't eat pie?

12:11.600 --> 12:15.082
You know, if you don't take it,
somebody will.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.388
- Mm.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.826
- Not even a taste, huh?

12:19.913 --> 12:21.566
Tiny little taste,
tip of your tongue?

12:24.613 --> 12:26.310
- Later.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.660
- Well, then, you won't mind
if I take it, will ya?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.795
Betty, can we get this,
uh, to go, sweetie?

12:32.882 --> 12:34.536
- Okay.
- Thank you, darlin'.

12:36.494 --> 12:39.628
You know what I could do
for you--and I'd be willing--

12:41.630 --> 12:44.720
I can swing by your place
and deliver that pie to you,

12:44.807 --> 12:46.809
any way you want it.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.376
- Mm.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.378
- Wherever
you want it delivered,

12:50.465 --> 12:54.251
however many times
you want it delivered.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.602
- That's all right, thank you.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.126
- You wouldn't wanna
wreck that beautiful chassis

12:59.213 --> 13:01.215
of yours, would you?

13:01.302 --> 13:02.869
I don't imagine
that delicious ass

13:02.956 --> 13:06.568
got that way by eating pie,
am I right?

13:06.655 --> 13:09.049
You know what I like best
about you, Rhona?

13:09.136 --> 13:11.834
You never once
asked me to cuddle.

13:11.921 --> 13:15.925
It was just straight to business
with you, all business, all day.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.754
And I fucking respect that.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.843
- I don't like to cuddle.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.410
- Of course not.
- Here you go.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.543
- Thank you, Betty.
You're a queen, darlin'.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.243
Listen to me, I want you to be
careful out there, all right?

13:29.330 --> 13:31.245
There's a lot of machine
under your right foot.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.944
Don't get too heavy on it.
- Mm.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.164
- You don't want the back end
stepping out, opposite lock.

13:37.251 --> 13:40.341
That's where
the danger happens, right?

13:40.428 --> 13:41.777
- Thank you.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.171
- Mm. You be good, huh?

14:14.201 --> 14:17.204
- Either one of you boys
seen this guy?

14:17.291 --> 14:18.770
- I'm fine, how are you?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.862
- I don't care much how you are.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.038
Have you seen him or not?

14:27.040 --> 14:30.739
- It's polite to say,
"Excuse me, can you help me?"

14:32.784 --> 14:34.395
He's putting his phone away.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.179
What are you gonna do,
try something?

14:37.833 --> 14:41.054
- Get outta here, man.
There's nothing here for you.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.281
- Who you looking for?

14:51.368 --> 14:52.543
- This guy.
You know him?

14:52.630 --> 14:54.328
- Oh, Richie.
I know that guy.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.069
He hangs out with
this other guy named Dominic.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.636
Usually they're at the diner
this time of night.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.334
- Thank you very much.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.249
Oh--sorry about the mess.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.039
- Oh, shit!

15:10.126 --> 15:12.433
Hey!

15:12.520 --> 15:14.739
Hey--hey, hey,
hey, hey, lady, lady.

15:14.826 --> 15:18.047
I'm just looking
for a few extra bucks.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.309
You got something?

16:34.167 --> 16:35.516
- What?

16:35.603 --> 16:36.952
- Do you think you can
alter the rules?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.780
- Is that what I think?

16:38.867 --> 16:41.739
- Don't at any time believe
you have control

16:41.826 --> 16:44.786
of the situation, ever.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.136
- I just stopped
for a cup of coffee.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.455
- You have four
more envelopes,

17:01.542 --> 17:05.894
five hours, 21 minutes,
and nine seconds to work with.

17:20.561 --> 17:24.130
- Dominic, Dominic, Dominic.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.435
How you doing, buddy?

17:25.522 --> 17:27.307
Pretty good?
- Yeah.

17:27.394 --> 17:30.701
- Look at that.
- Yeah, how you been?

17:30.788 --> 17:32.703
- I been good. You?

17:32.790 --> 17:35.228
- Yeah, okay.
- Have a seat.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.709
- Hey, I'm all right.

17:38.796 --> 17:39.754
- Yeah?

17:41.799 --> 17:45.020
Just talk to me.
What have you been up to?

17:45.107 --> 17:46.456
- I ain't been doing nothing.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.547
- Do not lie, Dominic.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.506
You know, it's only
gonna be worse for you.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.595
- Dominic, Dominic.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.510
- This must be some
mistaken situation,

17:56.597 --> 17:57.946
because I ain't
been doing nothing.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.687
I swear, Kane, nothing.

17:59.774 --> 18:04.300
- So you, uh--you--you're
saying I make mistakes?

18:04.387 --> 18:05.388
That what you're saying?

18:05.475 --> 18:07.173
- I ain't saying that, I--

18:07.260 --> 18:09.349
- You just fucking said it.
You said I make mistakes.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.872
That's what you said.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.352
- Well, I didn't
mean to say that.

18:12.439 --> 18:13.701
No disrespect, Kane. I'm just--

18:13.788 --> 18:17.183
- Where can I find
Richie, Dominic?

18:17.270 --> 18:19.707
- Richie?
- Richie, your boy.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.709
Oh, you hang out
with Richie, swap needles.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.276
I don't know, maybe you touch
fucking dongs, I don't know.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.886
Where the fuck
can I find Richie?

18:24.973 --> 18:26.975
Where can I find him?
- Oh, Richie.

18:27.062 --> 18:28.498
- Oh, oh, oh--
- Richie.

18:28.585 --> 18:29.630
- Richie.
- Oh, yeah, Richie, oh--

18:29.717 --> 18:31.414
- Yeah, fucking Richie, eh?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.373
- Richie, I--I mean, I haven't
seen Richie in a while.

18:33.460 --> 18:36.854
- What's "a while?"
What exactly is a while?

18:36.941 --> 18:38.987
Is that, like--is that
like a week, a--

18:39.074 --> 18:40.554
a month, a fucking millennia?

18:40.641 --> 18:41.598
What's a--what--what--
what's--what's a while?

18:41.685 --> 18:43.296
- I don't know, Kane.

18:43.383 --> 18:47.778
I don't know,
maybe four days?

18:47.865 --> 18:49.389
- Four days!

18:49.476 --> 18:51.217
We're gonna go with
four days for a while.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.522
I like that. I'm gonna go with
four days for a while.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.133
- Okay. -
So four days ago,

18:54.220 --> 18:57.962
where'd you see Richie, exactly?

18:58.049 --> 19:01.140
- Maybe the--the track, or--

19:01.227 --> 19:03.490
or the laundromat, the diner.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.492
You know, around, around,
like you do, yeah.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.710
- Around.
Around, yeah, yeah.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.757
I'm gonna need a drink--
a round.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.328
You know what we're gonna do?

19:15.415 --> 19:16.851
We're gonna play a game.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.418
You think we should
do the cigar box?

19:18.505 --> 19:21.203
Yeah, grab me the cigar box.
You like games?

19:21.290 --> 19:22.770
- Yeah.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.251
- You're gonna love this.
Look at this.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.774
So you and I--

19:26.861 --> 19:29.298
We're gonna do a little
bang-bang, okay?

19:29.385 --> 19:32.606
You go three clicks,
and I go three clicks.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.955
You do three clicks,

19:34.042 --> 19:35.609
you fucking walk
outta here, right?

19:35.696 --> 19:39.265
I mean, unless
I fucking blow my brains out.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.876
Sound good to you, Dominic?

19:41.963 --> 19:44.531
- Look, Kane...

19:44.618 --> 19:47.447
I swear to you
I ain't seen Richie, okay?

19:47.534 --> 19:52.103
Now, I ain't been doing nothing,
and I don't wanna do this.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.497
- You know what, you know what,
Dominic, okay,

19:54.584 --> 19:56.325
I'm gonna give you
a choice here.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.197
You can play the game with me,

19:58.284 --> 20:00.764
or you could tell me where
the fuck I can find Richie.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.288
- I don't know where Richie is.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.028
- Or you can do a dance
with my boy here.

20:04.115 --> 20:06.509
But unfortunately, he's probably
not gonna let you leave,

20:06.596 --> 20:08.903
and he loves
to fucking grab ass.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.734
- Kane, don't make me
do this, man.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.344
You gotta believe me,
I'm telling you.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.085
- What's it gonna be, Dom?

20:17.172 --> 20:18.739
- I don't know where Richie is.

20:21.089 --> 20:24.701
Don't make me do this.
Don't make me do this.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.703
- Oh, Dom, I swear to god
I thought--

20:26.790 --> 20:28.879
- Fuck you, Kane! Fuck you!

20:28.966 --> 20:30.403
- I fucking believe you.
I still believe you.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.493
Dom, I believe you.
Dom, I believe you.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.711
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:34.798 --> 20:38.106
Hey, hey--I believe you, buddy.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.543
I believe you, buddy.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.241
I believe you're gonna do it.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.765
You did, you pulled
that trigger, didn't you?

20:44.852 --> 20:46.288
Fucking Dominic
pulled that trigger.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.072
Have a seat.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.988
Have a seat.
Sit down.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.643
Look at me.
Look at me, look at me.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.602
You think I'm fucking stupid?
- Oh!

20:55.689 --> 20:57.517
- Pick your fucking head up
and look at me.

20:57.604 --> 21:01.695
Pick your fucking head up!
Dom, look at me!

21:01.782 --> 21:04.175
This is when the game
starts--right now.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.873
But here's the good news.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.353
That's one.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.529
Now it's my turn. Okay?

21:09.616 --> 21:12.053
It's my turn.
You ready for this?

21:12.140 --> 21:14.969
It's my turn.
Are you ready?

21:15.056 --> 21:17.276
Look at me.
Open your eyes, Dom!

21:17.363 --> 21:19.495
Don't you fucking
take your eyes off of me.

21:19.582 --> 21:22.063
Look at me! Dom!
Goddamn it--

21:22.150 --> 21:23.760
- No, I can't.
- --you fucking open your eyes.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.196
- No! No!
- Look! Look!

21:25.284 --> 21:27.286
You wanna see this,
motherfucker.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.504
- No!
- You wanna see it? Ah!

21:32.073 --> 21:33.596
You're up.

21:33.683 --> 21:34.771
Two more clicks, and you walk.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.425
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.992
- I can't!
- Look at me, Dom.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.776
You know what I'm gonna do?
- I can't do it.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.648
- Would you help him?
Give him air, help him out.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.258
My girl is gonna
help you out, Dom.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.173
- I can't.
- It's okay, it's okay.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.696
- I can't.

21:49.482 --> 21:51.048
- It's gonna be all right.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.488
- Atta boy.

21:55.575 --> 21:57.228
- I don't want to.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.621
- Maybe nobody believed
in you when you were a kid.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.102
I fucking believe in you, Dom.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.887
You can do this.
I believe in you, buddy.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.194
You're not a fucking--are
you a fucking pussy?

22:06.281 --> 22:08.109
Not the Dom I know!

22:09.676 --> 22:12.156
- I believe in you, buddy.
Dom, pull it.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.245
Pull it, motherfucker.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.204
Do it. Do it.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.380
Fucking do it, Dom.
Pull it!

22:18.467 --> 22:21.601
- Oh, fucking shit!

22:21.688 --> 22:24.386
Is that blood on my pool table?

22:24.473 --> 22:27.607
Wipe that shit off, would you?
I don't give a fuck.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.913
I don't want fucking
loser DNA in my house.

22:46.147 --> 22:48.367
- Are you going
to let me go now?

22:48.454 --> 22:49.846
- Soon.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.458
- Why are you doing this?

22:52.545 --> 22:53.894
- I have no choice.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.766
- My mother says
we always have a choice.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.336
- Did she also tell you you have
to live with the consequences?

23:01.423 --> 23:02.946
- Yeah.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.034
- A couple of years,
this will be a story

23:04.121 --> 23:05.645
you'll tell your friends.

23:05.732 --> 23:08.082
Eat your sandwich.
You'll see your mom soon.

23:37.503 --> 23:38.765
Bullshit.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.204
No, I'm not--I'm not doing this.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.380
Fuck you.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.774
Did you hear me?
Fuck you.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.709
Fucking asshole!

24:39.173 --> 24:40.957
- The kid's not here, Rhona.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.439
- You know I still have to look.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.702
- And you know
I can't just let you do that.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.185
- That would be a real shame.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.360
- Tell you what.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.798
I'm gonna go take a smoke break.

24:55.885 --> 24:58.497
I'm gonna be back

24:58.584 --> 25:02.109
in 10 minutes exactly.

25:02.196 --> 25:03.589
- Cigarettes are bad for you.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.679
- Yeah. So is life.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.160
Hey.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.858
I hope you find him.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.474
- Hey.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.651
Your kid ain't here.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.000
- Then where?

26:07.087 --> 26:08.828
- Even if I knew,
I couldn't say.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.440
Look, you're going
about this all wrong.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.616
I am not your enemy.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.140
- Everyone is the enemy tonight.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.881
- I understand that,
but nothing positive

26:18.968 --> 26:20.796
will come from you aiming
your weapon at me.

26:20.883 --> 26:24.365
- I'm willing to find out.
- Well, I'd prefer we didn't.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.759
So if you will...

26:28.717 --> 26:30.414
Very kind of you.

26:32.112 --> 26:36.507
Hey, despite what you may
believe, we have a code.

26:36.595 --> 26:40.381
Family is strictly off-limits.

26:40.468 --> 26:43.210
Vladik crossed that line,
and he will be dealt with.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.603
- Doubtful.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.953
- I assure you, he will be.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.564
- I know you have mutual
business with Vladik.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.785
- Hey, hey, that ain't
none of your business.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.395
- You lie.

26:54.482 --> 26:57.703
We've known one another
for a very long time.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.574
Don't play me.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.402
- I would never do such a thing.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.883
- Do you know
where my son is or not?

27:03.970 --> 27:05.406
- I truly don't.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.758
- And if you knew...

27:11.934 --> 27:12.979
would you tell me?

27:13.066 --> 27:14.720
- That would be a question.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.678
- That is the question.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.854
- Like I said.

27:18.941 --> 27:22.553
- If anything happens
to Mika, if he dies...

27:22.641 --> 27:26.253
- I know, I know:
you'll come for me.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.558
Go in peace.

29:27.548 --> 29:28.984
- What is it?

29:29.071 --> 29:30.986
- You won't find answers
in our safehouses.

29:31.073 --> 29:33.032
I suggest you use
your time wisely.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.077
- Well, I want proof of life.

29:35.164 --> 29:38.472
- Do the job and
you get your son back.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.248
- Au revoir.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.567
- Yeah, okay,
I'll take care of it.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.526
- Yes, I got her.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.194
Let me speak to my son.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.805
- Must we have this conversation
every time we speak?

33:44.892 --> 33:47.286
- What, am I being annoying, hm?

33:47.373 --> 33:50.115
Because I want
to talk to my son?

33:50.202 --> 33:52.247
- Perhaps after your next
assignment,

33:52.334 --> 33:55.468
as a sign of good faith I'll
give you a moment with Mika.

33:55.555 --> 33:58.993
- This is all just
a game to you, isn't it?

33:59.080 --> 34:01.300
- 3:31 a.m.

34:01.387 --> 34:04.912
- Look--

34:17.794 --> 34:19.535
- You got enough to eat?

34:19.622 --> 34:22.147
- Why are you worried
about my diet?

34:22.234 --> 34:23.626
- I'm not worried.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.932
I just wanna make
sure you get fed.

34:25.019 --> 34:28.153
- Does he talk?

34:28.240 --> 34:30.459
- Ask him.
- Do you talk?

34:32.244 --> 34:33.984
I guess not.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.334
- He's a thinker.

34:35.421 --> 34:36.683
- Where's my mom?

34:36.770 --> 34:38.859
- She's running
an errand for me.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.687
- What kind of errand?

34:40.774 --> 34:43.037
- Nothing for you
to be concerned about.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.474
- Why? Because it's illegal?

34:45.561 --> 34:47.172
- What makes
you think it's illegal?

34:47.259 --> 34:51.263
- I'm pretty sure you guys
don't have normal jobs.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.829
- We work all the same.

34:52.916 --> 34:55.528
It's just our hours
are a little different.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.617
- Then why does he have a gun?

34:59.358 --> 35:00.620
- It's for your safety.

35:00.707 --> 35:03.231
- That's something
a cop would say.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.059
- You got a problem with cops?

35:05.146 --> 35:06.887
- I guess they're okay.

35:06.974 --> 35:10.282
My mom says to never
trust a cop or a lawyer.

35:10.369 --> 35:13.894
Says they're always looking
for ways to take you down.

35:13.981 --> 35:16.549
- Well, you can add
priests to that list, too.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.551
- And car salesmen.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.770
- Just... just
get some rest, okay?

35:25.035 --> 35:26.689
- You really don't talk?

35:36.308 --> 35:37.918
- Jimmie.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.268
We were wondering
when you'd surface.

35:40.355 --> 35:41.704
Where are the guns?

35:41.791 --> 35:44.751
- I, uh--I didn't know
what to do, man.

35:44.838 --> 35:47.101
- You were supposed
to hijack Vladik's shipment,

35:47.188 --> 35:49.799
and yet, no guns.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.715
- Listen, I gotta
speak with Kane.

35:52.802 --> 35:55.892
I know he's back there,
so sh-sh-sh-shush.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.590
Outta my way,
I'm not afraid of you.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.287
- Jimmie, why would
you say that?

35:59.374 --> 36:01.159
- That's a good question,
and I'm glad you asked.

36:01.246 --> 36:05.337
Because you don't control me
when I'm holding a gun.

36:05.424 --> 36:06.947
- What are you gonna
do with it, Jimmie?

36:07.034 --> 36:10.777
- Whatever I want, man.
Whatever I need to do.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.474
Whoa, hey!

36:12.561 --> 36:14.694
- Okay, well, let's
put our guns down, Jimmie,

36:14.781 --> 36:16.522
and we can talk about it.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.787
- Yeah, let's talk about this.

36:20.874 --> 36:24.269
You hang out while I'm boots
on the ground slaving,

36:24.356 --> 36:27.185
earning, so that Kane

36:27.272 --> 36:29.448
can have all this...

36:29.535 --> 36:31.624
this fancy shit.

36:31.711 --> 36:35.715
This, right here.
This fancy--huh?

36:35.802 --> 36:37.238
- You shouldn't do that, Jimmie.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.893
- Why don't you back up?

36:39.980 --> 36:41.329
- Okay, Jimmie.

36:41.416 --> 36:42.504
- Why you keep
saying my name, man?

36:42.591 --> 36:44.202
Stop saying my fucking name.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.551
- Why, Jimmie?

36:45.638 --> 36:47.248
You don't like
your name, Jimmie?

36:47.335 --> 36:51.078
- It's messing with my head.
I don't like that.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.645
- I understand.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.821
- Oh, you understand, Hannibal?

36:54.908 --> 36:58.868
You're one of those
understanding--

37:02.829 --> 37:04.570
Hah!

37:04.657 --> 37:06.659
The Russian, he was fucking--
he was stalling, man.

37:06.746 --> 37:10.097
And the whole deal,
it went sideways.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.055
I didn't know it
would go down like this.

37:12.142 --> 37:13.666
I mean, I like you,
and I don't wanna have

37:13.753 --> 37:16.234
to shoot you in your
fucking pretty face.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.366
I need to speak with Kane,

37:18.453 --> 37:21.239
because I just...
I just need him to know.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.718
I just--

38:08.460 --> 38:10.026
- Shit.

38:19.209 --> 38:21.342
- Hey, Rhona.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.301
- Tony. How's it going?

38:23.388 --> 38:24.606
- Good.

38:24.693 --> 38:27.348
This a social visit?

38:27.435 --> 38:28.915
- Up to her.

38:29.002 --> 38:31.787
- All right.
I'll follow you.

38:44.670 --> 38:48.021
- I see you, a gun,

38:48.108 --> 38:50.806
a late-night visit,

38:50.893 --> 38:54.114
and I assume,
with you, problems.

38:54.201 --> 38:55.855
Too many to count.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.945
Why are you here?

38:59.032 --> 39:00.642
- The cash.

39:00.729 --> 39:03.602
- I made a cash deal
to keep the peace,

39:03.689 --> 39:08.041
and now he sends you
to what, take it back?

39:12.393 --> 39:15.701
- I'm asking, please.

39:15.788 --> 39:17.746
- Then why the gun?

39:17.833 --> 39:20.880
Doesn't seem to me like asking.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.970
- Insurance.

39:24.057 --> 39:25.928
- Well, insurance has a price.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.107
I keep the cash.

39:31.194 --> 39:35.547
Now, off you go.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.254
She'll be back.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.791
- Take care.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.211
- Yeah?
- It's me.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.608
- What's up?

40:36.695 --> 40:38.740
- We found Richie.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.874
He's pushing snow
to Santos' men tonight.

40:41.961 --> 40:44.224
- Grab Hannibal and the boys,
and go fetch him, huh?

40:44.311 --> 40:46.400
Alive.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.358
- That'd be up to him

40:48.446 --> 40:50.709
- A-live.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.890
- He said he wants
to see us at 4:00 p.m.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.674
Is that good?
- Let's do 5:00. It's too early.

40:59.761 --> 41:00.849
- No, I don't wanna do 5:00,
so we'll do 7:00 p.m.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.416
7:00 p.m.'s fine.

41:02.503 --> 41:04.200
- Do you wanna just go
right now instead?

41:04.287 --> 41:05.898
- No, I don't wanna do
right now. We'll do 9:00 p.m.

41:05.985 --> 41:07.726
- 9:00 p.m. it is, works for me.
I'll do 9:00 p.m.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.554
- Richie? Richie?

41:10.642 --> 41:11.556
Richie.
- What?

41:11.643 --> 41:13.166
- Company.

41:17.910 --> 41:20.695
- Oh, hey, fellas.

41:20.782 --> 41:23.002
What a surprise.

41:23.089 --> 41:25.134
- For you, or for us, Richie?

41:25.221 --> 41:28.964
- I was, uh, coincidentally,
uh, just--

41:29.051 --> 41:30.749
just thinking about you guys.

41:30.836 --> 41:33.012
- Sure you were.

41:33.099 --> 41:34.579
It's time to take a ride.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.363
- Oh, you know, I appreciate it,

41:36.450 --> 41:38.147
but, uh, look, I got
a lotta work to do here.

41:38.234 --> 41:40.715
So I'm--I'll catch up
with you guys later, hm?

41:40.802 --> 41:42.456
- It's not an invitation.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.589
- Wait, no, hold on.

41:44.676 --> 41:46.155
Guys, guys.

42:05.914 --> 42:08.047
- We've got company,
Santos' men.

42:12.878 --> 42:16.272
- No, no!
Let me go!

43:05.583 --> 43:07.193
- My son.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.021
- We've been through this,
you know the rules.

43:09.108 --> 43:12.198
Take out each target associated
with the numbered envelope.

43:12.285 --> 43:14.069
Acquire my items,
put the items in the bag.

43:14.156 --> 43:16.898
Then, and only then,
will you see your son.

43:16.985 --> 43:18.421
I mean, what part
of this doesn't register

43:18.508 --> 43:19.945
in your grey matter?

43:20.032 --> 43:22.687
- I want to speak
with my child, now.

43:22.774 --> 43:24.514
- You wanna speak to your child?

43:24.602 --> 43:26.647
- Yes.

43:26.734 --> 43:29.084
- Start by giving me fire.

43:29.171 --> 43:32.784
- I want to speak
with Mika, that's all.

43:32.871 --> 43:34.089
- You heard me.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.006
- Fuck.

43:49.583 --> 43:51.193
- This is Ling's.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.893
- Order for delivery.
- Go ahead.

43:54.980 --> 43:59.201
- Number 11, with two fortune
cookies.

43:59.288 --> 44:00.899
And a hot tea.

44:00.986 --> 44:03.249
- Any pie to go with that?

44:03.336 --> 44:05.033
- No.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.818
- We'll be there soon.

44:16.001 --> 44:17.480
- What is it?

44:17.567 --> 44:20.440
- Use your time wisely.
You've barely begun.

44:20.527 --> 44:23.399
It's getting late.
Tick-tock.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.085
- Hello, Santos.

45:03.135 --> 45:06.878
- And to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

45:06.965 --> 45:08.836
- I want you
to give me the drive.

45:08.923 --> 45:11.404
- Hah.

45:11.491 --> 45:14.407
This should get interesting.
And why would I do that?

45:14.494 --> 45:17.323
- Because it's
in everyone's best interest.

45:17.410 --> 45:18.585
- Everyone's?

45:20.761 --> 45:21.936
- Yours.

45:27.768 --> 45:29.683
- Not my best angle.

45:29.770 --> 45:31.903
- And not my choice.

45:34.079 --> 45:35.341
- Whose, then?

45:35.428 --> 45:36.995
- You know.

45:37.082 --> 45:38.257
- Yes, I do.

45:39.693 --> 45:41.826
- The easy way would be best.

45:41.913 --> 45:43.958
- For you.

45:44.045 --> 45:45.612
- For everyone.

45:49.790 --> 45:52.750
- Yeah, perhaps, perhaps not.

45:52.837 --> 45:55.361
You and I go back a long way.

45:55.448 --> 45:56.841
- Yeah, we do.

45:56.928 --> 45:59.452
- Eighteen years.
- Sixteen.

46:00.714 --> 46:02.585
- Are you correcting me?

46:02.672 --> 46:04.544
- Reminding you.

46:04.631 --> 46:06.720
- Hm.

46:06.807 --> 46:10.202
Word has it you're on a quest.

46:10.289 --> 46:11.899
- I'd rather not be.

46:11.986 --> 46:15.337
- You know,
quests can be life-changing.

46:15.424 --> 46:17.992
- This could be life-ending.

46:18.079 --> 46:20.386
- We don't want that,
now, do we?

46:20.473 --> 46:22.475
- No, we don't.

46:22.562 --> 46:25.870
- And, uh, you think
I can help you?

46:25.957 --> 46:27.828
- I could just take it.

46:29.699 --> 46:33.399
- Honest--that's what
I've always liked about you.

46:33.486 --> 46:36.706
- I don't have time to play.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.970
- Flaco.

46:46.455 --> 46:48.240
You and I have
never had a problem.

46:48.327 --> 46:50.242
- Not yet, we haven't.

46:50.329 --> 46:54.594
- You always kept things
on a professional level,

46:54.681 --> 46:57.075
never personal.

46:57.162 --> 46:59.164
- When I could.

46:59.251 --> 47:01.949
- You did it right.

47:02.036 --> 47:05.518
That's what people remember:
that you can be relied on.

47:15.006 --> 47:18.096
- I'm not here for you.

47:18.183 --> 47:19.532
- That's good to hear.

47:19.619 --> 47:20.533
You know...

47:22.709 --> 47:24.363
I made copies.

47:24.450 --> 47:25.973
- I know.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.932
- You know, you could
have just taken me out.

47:28.019 --> 47:30.412
- Sixteen years.

47:35.722 --> 47:37.680
- I can just finish her off.

47:37.767 --> 47:40.074
- Nah.

47:40.161 --> 47:42.294
Sixteen years.

47:42.381 --> 47:43.556
Hm.

48:04.055 --> 48:05.708
- Rain. Chiko.

48:05.795 --> 48:08.973
- How was the pie with Kane?

48:09.060 --> 48:11.976
- I try to avoid sugar.

48:12.063 --> 48:15.240
- Number 11,
just as you requested.

48:16.981 --> 48:19.157
Happy?
- Always.

48:19.244 --> 48:21.724
All right, let's do this.

48:21.811 --> 48:23.335
- All right.

48:32.170 --> 48:33.345
So, how's it fit?

48:33.432 --> 48:35.303
- Like a prom dress.

48:38.132 --> 48:42.006
- You got the guns.
Take this as a receipt.

48:42.093 --> 48:43.268
Good luck, Rhona.

49:01.851 --> 49:03.766
- Ah!

50:06.829 --> 50:08.353
- Well done.

51:50.063 --> 51:51.064
- Where's Mika?

51:51.151 --> 51:53.066
- Oh, how should I know?

51:54.285 --> 51:55.460
- Last chance.

52:15.001 --> 52:16.829
Oh...

52:19.745 --> 52:22.008
Oh.

52:32.323 --> 52:34.107
- You took a round.

52:34.194 --> 52:35.935
- More than you can say.

52:36.022 --> 52:38.155
- You should never take a round.

52:38.242 --> 52:39.852
I trained you better than that.

52:41.201 --> 52:42.855
It's getting late.

53:25.071 --> 53:28.509
- Wakey, wakey, eggs and bacey.

53:32.774 --> 53:36.778
Where are my guns, Richie?
Where they at?

53:36.865 --> 53:38.519
Hey, buddy.

53:38.606 --> 53:40.129
You don't think
I'd forget about you, do you?

53:42.567 --> 53:44.917
- Richie, stay with us.

53:47.746 --> 53:49.443
- Now, see, I know you
had a meeting

53:49.530 --> 53:52.316
with Jack the Flower, right?

53:52.403 --> 53:53.665
What'd you talk to Jack about?

53:53.752 --> 53:55.362
- What are you talking about?

53:55.449 --> 53:57.103
I don't--I never met with Jack,
not even one time.

53:57.190 --> 53:58.452
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

53:58.539 --> 53:59.584
- Not one?
- I'm telling the truth.

53:59.671 --> 54:01.368
I wouldn't lie to you, man.

54:01.455 --> 54:02.891
- Yeah, you wouldn't--
you wouldn't fucking lie to me.

54:02.978 --> 54:04.153
- I'm telling the truth.
I wouldn't lie to you, man.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.720
- Yeah.

54:05.807 --> 54:07.374
- I might be crazy,
but I'm not stupid.

54:07.461 --> 54:08.157
- Not at all?
Not even a little fucking lie?

54:08.245 --> 54:09.420
- No! No.

54:09.507 --> 54:11.770
- All right.
Show him, huh?

54:13.859 --> 54:15.861
Now see, Richie,
do you really think

54:15.948 --> 54:17.384
you could do something like
that and get away with it?

54:17.471 --> 54:19.343
- I don't know when that--

54:19.430 --> 54:21.127
- You really think you could
pull off something like that,

54:21.214 --> 54:22.520
and me not find out about it?

54:22.607 --> 54:24.435
- I don't know--
I don't know when that--

54:24.522 --> 54:26.785
I don't know when that was.
I--I don't know when that--

54:26.872 --> 54:27.916
- You don't know what
I'm talking about?

54:28.003 --> 54:29.135
- No.
- Not at all?

54:29.222 --> 54:30.179
- No.

54:31.268 --> 54:32.878
- Give him one.

54:37.143 --> 54:38.884
- Oh, shit!

54:38.971 --> 54:40.799
Richie, Richie!

54:40.886 --> 54:42.540
You know now, buddy?
- Yeah, I do.

54:42.627 --> 54:44.063
- You know now?
- I do, I do, yes.

54:44.150 --> 54:45.456
- Huh? You know what
I'm talking about?

54:45.543 --> 54:47.327
- Yes, yes.
I ran into him at a bar.

54:47.414 --> 54:48.676
I just ran into him at a bar.

54:48.763 --> 54:50.112
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

54:50.199 --> 54:51.549
- So you don't
know nothing, huh?

54:51.636 --> 54:52.811
- I don't know anything.

54:52.898 --> 54:54.203
If I don't know anything,

54:54.291 --> 54:55.901
how could I tell
him anything, right?

54:55.988 --> 54:58.904
- I gotcha. So, ignorance,
that's your defense?

54:58.991 --> 54:59.992
- Yeah.

55:02.386 --> 55:03.865
- It really was just
happenstance, wasn't it?

55:03.952 --> 55:05.389
- Yeah, yeah.

55:05.476 --> 55:07.260
- It was just--
it was just dumb luck.

55:07.347 --> 55:10.568
- Fucking dumb luck, which
is really fucking dumb luck.

55:10.655 --> 55:12.700
- Really--
- Like, so fucking dumb.

55:12.787 --> 55:14.920
Oh, fuck.
- Really bad.

55:15.007 --> 55:17.705
- Richie, I got--here's
the only question I have.

55:17.792 --> 55:19.620
What the--what the fuck
do I do with you?

55:19.707 --> 55:20.665
- I'll do anything
for you, Kane.

55:20.752 --> 55:22.275
Anything you need.

55:22.362 --> 55:24.277
- Because I'm feeling
fucking magnanimous.

55:24.364 --> 55:25.757
- Magnanimous.

55:25.844 --> 55:28.107
- Generous, Richie.
Fuck, keep up.

55:28.194 --> 55:29.587
- Oh--okay.
- Really generous, like--

55:29.674 --> 55:32.285
- You'll let me go, then?

55:32.372 --> 55:33.634
- Yeah.

55:36.420 --> 55:37.508
Yeah, Richie.

55:38.422 --> 55:39.901
I can do that, buddy.

55:41.338 --> 55:44.776
I guess I just need you
to do me one favor.

55:44.863 --> 55:47.169
- Anything. Anything, Kane.

55:47.256 --> 55:49.955
- Yeah?
- Anything.

55:50.042 --> 55:51.696
- Don't beg.

55:51.783 --> 55:54.089
- What?
- That shit fucking disgusts me.

55:56.701 --> 55:59.138
- Where you going?
Where you going?

55:59.225 --> 56:00.400
Where you going?

56:33.999 --> 56:36.567
- Why are you here?
- Please, can you help us?

56:36.654 --> 56:38.482
- Shh!
- Can you help us?

56:38.569 --> 56:41.223
- Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

56:41.310 --> 56:43.835
Here--have you seen this boy?
Look.

56:43.922 --> 56:45.489
- Yes, yes.
- What?

56:45.576 --> 56:47.534
- Yes, I have.
- When? Where?

56:47.621 --> 56:51.190
- Yesterday, in the office.

56:51.277 --> 56:53.018
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

56:53.105 --> 56:54.149
Shh.

56:54.236 --> 56:55.847
Hold on.

56:57.196 --> 56:59.590
This will do. Okay.

57:02.593 --> 57:04.595
Be quiet.

57:10.775 --> 57:13.517
Go, go, go, go!

57:13.604 --> 57:15.127
Wait, wait, wait.

57:15.214 --> 57:16.607
Here, take this.

57:16.694 --> 57:17.738
- No, no, no.
- Yes!

57:17.825 --> 57:19.261
Split it up and get outta here.

57:19.348 --> 57:20.524
There's a door right there,
you--you--

57:20.611 --> 57:21.786
Get outside, and you run.

57:21.873 --> 57:23.657
- Thank you.
- Go! Go!

58:46.392 --> 58:48.046
- Oh!

59:26.258 --> 59:29.478
- Apologies for the tardiness,
but, uh, I did bring pie.

59:43.362 --> 59:45.886
So tell me, how's
that reimbursement program

59:45.973 --> 59:47.932
coming along, good?

59:48.019 --> 59:49.847
- I'm working on it.

59:49.934 --> 59:52.197
- You're working on it, huh?

59:52.284 --> 59:56.418
Like, uh, in the practical,
or more like the abstract?

59:56.505 --> 59:59.857
- Reality.
- Reality.

59:59.944 --> 1:00:01.380
Yeah, because, see,
my reality is I don't get

1:00:01.467 --> 1:00:03.121
my money by 7:00 a.m.,

1:00:03.208 --> 1:00:04.905
I'm planning
a poor man's funeral.

1:00:07.429 --> 1:00:09.040
You know what
a poor man's funeral is?

1:00:09.127 --> 1:00:11.085
- Yeah, I got my suspicions.

1:00:11.172 --> 1:00:13.479
- It's your funeral.

1:00:13.566 --> 1:00:15.437
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1:00:15.524 --> 1:00:17.135
I mean, still gonna have some
bells and whistles for you.

1:00:17.222 --> 1:00:18.702
You know, crying hookers,
shit like that.

1:00:18.789 --> 1:00:20.965
But it's yours.

1:00:22.793 --> 1:00:25.534
So, you know,
word on the street

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:27.711
is you got Rhona making
laundry runs for you.

1:00:27.798 --> 1:00:29.277
That right?

1:00:29.364 --> 1:00:32.063
- Couple items needed
cleaning up, yeah.

1:00:32.150 --> 1:00:33.238
- Oh.

1:00:38.156 --> 1:00:40.071
So be honest with me.

1:00:40.158 --> 1:00:41.986
That why you took the kid?

1:00:42.073 --> 1:00:44.336
- Some people need more
motivating than others.

1:00:44.423 --> 1:00:45.380
- Right.

1:00:46.773 --> 1:00:48.253
I don't imagine
she's gonna be doing

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:51.169
any laundry stops at my place.
Am I right?

1:00:51.256 --> 1:00:53.650
- Not unless you
spill your milk.

1:00:53.737 --> 1:00:55.216
- See, now you got me curious.

1:00:57.349 --> 1:00:59.743
Because I usually
never spill milk.

1:00:59.830 --> 1:01:01.353
- I'm sure.

1:01:02.571 --> 1:01:06.488
- Well, I guess
it's that time, right?

1:01:06.575 --> 1:01:09.317
Bring him out.
- Ricky.

1:01:17.325 --> 1:01:19.371
- Hey, take it easy on him.

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:21.068
- What, are you
going soft on me?

1:01:21.155 --> 1:01:23.114
Come on, it's like you
said on the phone,

1:01:23.201 --> 1:01:25.682
this is just an insurance
policy, nothing more.

1:01:25.769 --> 1:01:27.814
- Just a kid.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:30.730
- He's gonna be safe
like he's in his mama's arms,

1:01:30.817 --> 1:01:34.125
sucking on that
nice, perky tit.

1:01:34.212 --> 1:01:35.387
Isn't that right?

1:01:37.084 --> 1:01:41.306
Well, I appreciate
the hospitality.

1:01:41.393 --> 1:01:42.786
- Any time.

1:01:42.873 --> 1:01:45.179
- Any time?

1:01:45.266 --> 1:01:46.964
Any time?

1:01:47.051 --> 1:01:49.227
I come here any time
I want, right?

1:01:49.314 --> 1:01:51.011
Holy shit.

1:01:51.098 --> 1:01:54.188
Don't forget,
I paid for this shit.

1:02:10.161 --> 1:02:13.381
Look at that.
Nothing.

1:02:13.468 --> 1:02:14.905
Just like I thought.

1:02:16.558 --> 1:02:18.082
7:00 a.m.

1:02:31.835 --> 1:02:33.401
- Hello, Rhona.

1:02:35.273 --> 1:02:37.449
This look actually suits you.

1:02:41.279 --> 1:02:45.109
You interfere in my business.

1:02:45.196 --> 1:02:47.938
You free my product.

1:02:48.025 --> 1:02:49.548
You affect my income.

1:02:52.029 --> 1:02:54.988
I take exception on this.

1:03:02.430 --> 1:03:05.607
It was you that hijacked
Vladik's deal, wasn't it?

1:03:07.131 --> 1:03:08.915
The gun deal, am I right?

1:03:10.656 --> 1:03:12.049
Well, it had to be.

1:03:12.136 --> 1:03:13.920
It couldn't be
that imbecile, Richie.

1:03:14.007 --> 1:03:16.401
He can't even find his shoes
when they're on his feet.

1:03:16.488 --> 1:03:18.316
That was you.

1:03:18.403 --> 1:03:22.015
- Just give me the ledger,
and we'll all go home tonight.

1:03:22.102 --> 1:03:23.625
- Just give you the ledger.

1:03:23.712 --> 1:03:25.453
Sure, I'll just,
I'll just give you my ledger.

1:03:25.540 --> 1:03:28.456
Andre, this, this woman
is very funny, isn't she?

1:03:28.543 --> 1:03:29.893
- Mm.

1:03:29.980 --> 1:03:32.809
- Yeah, I'll just give
you the ledger.

1:03:32.896 --> 1:03:34.462
You free my product,

1:03:34.549 --> 1:03:37.248
and you have the balls
to make demands on me?

1:03:37.335 --> 1:03:39.337
You, you are something.

1:03:40.773 --> 1:03:42.906
I know exactly why you're here.

1:03:42.993 --> 1:03:46.213
I know who sent you.

1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:50.435
And you, you little Judas,

1:03:50.522 --> 1:03:52.611
you took that money, didn't you?

1:03:58.747 --> 1:04:00.401
- Oh!

1:04:04.144 --> 1:04:07.104
- I find that to be
very audacious.

1:04:07.191 --> 1:04:09.280
- You own a toothbrush?

1:04:18.376 --> 1:04:20.117
- Games.

1:04:20.204 --> 1:04:23.685
Games, Andre, they always
have to play games, right?

1:04:25.383 --> 1:04:27.211
You're risking your life,

1:04:27.298 --> 1:04:29.387
and you don't even understand
the big picture.

1:04:32.564 --> 1:04:34.218
Here.

1:04:34.305 --> 1:04:38.309
Here's the ledger.
It's all here.

1:04:38.396 --> 1:04:41.051
Oh, oh, let's--let's
not tempt fate.

1:04:44.228 --> 1:04:48.319
Every deal I ever made
is right in this ledger.

1:04:49.537 --> 1:04:52.714
What can I say?
Call me old-school.

1:04:52.801 --> 1:04:56.762
And what really fascinates me
is that he sent you

1:04:56.849 --> 1:05:00.766
to get this ledger, and you
agreed without hesitation.

1:05:02.507 --> 1:05:03.769
- And kill you.

1:05:03.856 --> 1:05:06.293
- Oh, to kill me.

1:05:07.599 --> 1:05:08.600
Wow.

1:05:18.653 --> 1:05:21.265
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:26.792
You cost me a lot of money
when you freed my product.

1:05:26.879 --> 1:05:29.534
And, uh, you still look like

1:05:29.621 --> 1:05:32.276
you have a few good
rides in you, right?

1:05:32.363 --> 1:05:36.410
So I'm gonna ply
my boys up with Sildenafil,

1:05:36.497 --> 1:05:39.239
and I'm gonna give you to them,
so they could have their way

1:05:39.326 --> 1:05:43.461
with you for
as long as they want.

1:05:43.548 --> 1:05:48.814
And when they bore of you,
in about a year,

1:05:48.901 --> 1:05:53.079
I'm gonna sell you at
a very deep discount

1:05:53.166 --> 1:05:56.822
to the Eastern
European mongrels,

1:05:56.909 --> 1:06:00.391
and maybe I'll get a
little bit back of what I lost.

1:06:00.478 --> 1:06:03.568
- Or, we make a deal,

1:06:03.655 --> 1:06:07.702
and you avoid
a slow, painful death.

1:06:09.313 --> 1:06:12.403
- You got nothing
I want or need.

1:06:12.490 --> 1:06:15.928
- He'll send someone else.

1:06:16.015 --> 1:06:20.715
Or better yet, come himself.

1:06:20.802 --> 1:06:23.327
- Oh, Vladik.

1:06:26.547 --> 1:06:29.594
Vladik and I, suffice it to say,

1:06:29.681 --> 1:06:33.424
we've been doing this dance
a long, long time, you know?

1:06:33.511 --> 1:06:35.382
He's my personal Sisyphus.

1:06:35.469 --> 1:06:38.342
You know who Sisyphus is?
Do you?

1:06:38.429 --> 1:06:42.389
Good. You know, up and down,
up and down.

1:06:42.476 --> 1:06:46.611
And of course, he absolutely
despises my skin trade business.

1:06:46.698 --> 1:06:49.918
But the Rhodes Scholar Richie
explained to me

1:06:50.006 --> 1:06:53.705
the only reason Vladik
really wants to eliminate me

1:06:53.792 --> 1:06:58.101
and Kane is so he could
expand his own empire.

1:06:58.188 --> 1:07:00.799
There's nothing new here.

1:07:00.886 --> 1:07:03.236
It's really cliché.

1:07:03.323 --> 1:07:08.285
You know, long live
the king, that B.S.

1:07:08.372 --> 1:07:09.938
So, my love...

1:07:13.203 --> 1:07:15.379
You get some rest.

1:07:15.466 --> 1:07:18.338
You're gonna be wishing
for it when my--

1:07:18.425 --> 1:07:20.471
when my boys get a hold of you.

1:07:20.558 --> 1:07:22.168
- Mm.

1:07:22.255 --> 1:07:24.344
- Andre.

1:08:09.215 --> 1:08:10.347
- Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

1:08:10.434 --> 1:08:11.696
Turn around.

1:08:11.783 --> 1:08:14.351
Uh-huh.
Now bend over, bend over.

1:08:14.438 --> 1:08:17.571
Put--put your butt more to me.

1:08:17.658 --> 1:08:20.357
Now look this way.
Oh, that's great.

1:08:20.444 --> 1:08:25.362
Okay, arch your back, now.
Arch your back.

1:08:25.449 --> 1:08:28.365
Come on, show me your tits,
put them over here.

1:08:28.452 --> 1:08:31.237
Come on, stick your...
Stick your boobs out.

1:08:31.324 --> 1:08:32.543
Take your arms
and put them together.

1:08:32.630 --> 1:08:34.545
Make them look bigger.

1:08:34.632 --> 1:08:35.807
Yeah, arch your back,
look right here--

1:08:35.894 --> 1:08:37.330
Oh, that's nice.

1:08:37.417 --> 1:08:39.202
Oh, they're gonna
love you in Serbia.

1:08:39.289 --> 1:08:40.899
- Mm.
- Yeah, smile.

1:08:40.986 --> 1:08:43.684
Come on, look like
you're having a great time.

1:08:43.771 --> 1:08:44.903
- That's nice.

1:08:44.990 --> 1:08:48.211
Yeah.

1:08:48.298 --> 1:08:49.647
Excellent.

1:08:49.734 --> 1:08:51.170
Okay, now look at me,
look at me.

1:08:51.257 --> 1:08:53.216
Arch your--
keep arching your back.

1:08:53.303 --> 1:08:54.695
- Oh, that's good.

1:09:07.708 --> 1:09:09.275
- Bitch!

1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:42.395
- What is it?

1:09:42.482 --> 1:09:44.005
- Open the glove box.

1:09:46.007 --> 1:09:48.793
Had I wanted to kill you, you
would have been dead already.

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:52.057
If you seek answers,
open the glove box.

1:09:52.144 --> 1:09:54.015
- Fine!

1:09:56.844 --> 1:09:57.932
More games?

1:09:58.019 --> 1:09:59.673
- Now the envelope.

1:10:05.462 --> 1:10:07.072
- Mika's at your place?

1:10:07.159 --> 1:10:08.987
- Bring me my bag.

1:10:40.018 --> 1:10:41.324
- Where is Mika?

1:10:41.411 --> 1:10:42.542
- Gimme the case.

1:10:42.629 --> 1:10:44.196
- Mika first.

1:10:44.283 --> 1:10:45.241
- He's not here.

1:10:45.328 --> 1:10:46.503
- You said he was here.

1:10:46.590 --> 1:10:48.287
- No, I said bring me my things.

1:10:48.374 --> 1:10:50.681
- You lied?
- And you stole.

1:10:50.768 --> 1:10:52.987
- Where's my son?
Where's Mika?

1:10:53.074 --> 1:10:54.119
- He's with Kane.

1:10:54.206 --> 1:10:56.034
- What? Why?

1:10:56.121 --> 1:10:57.949
- Because I owe Kane
a lot of money.

1:10:58.036 --> 1:11:01.039
More than you stole.
He forced my hand.

1:11:01.126 --> 1:11:03.607
I had no choice
but to manipulate you.

1:11:03.694 --> 1:11:05.609
- So you let him take our son?

1:11:07.306 --> 1:11:09.177
- A son I've never known.

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:13.399
- Because I didn't want him
to be anywhere near this life.

1:11:13.486 --> 1:11:16.533
Because he is innocent.
He's pure.

1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:18.752
He's the exact
opposite of what we are,

1:11:18.839 --> 1:11:20.493
don't you understand that?

1:11:22.669 --> 1:11:23.888
He's the one thing
that you gave me

1:11:23.975 --> 1:11:25.846
that I'm actually grateful for.

1:11:27.805 --> 1:11:30.068
So yes, I saw the opportunity,

1:11:30.155 --> 1:11:32.897
and I took the money
and your guns,

1:11:32.984 --> 1:11:36.944
because I wanted him to be as
far away from this place and...

1:11:37.031 --> 1:11:38.555
- And me?

1:11:38.642 --> 1:11:40.948
- Yes, and you.

1:11:42.167 --> 1:11:44.691
What we had was about us.

1:11:46.606 --> 1:11:49.174
Now it's about Mika.
- I know.

1:11:49.261 --> 1:11:51.132
- And that's the only thing
that matters.

1:11:51.219 --> 1:11:55.311
- If I don't get that money to
Kane by 7:00, our son is dead.

1:11:55.398 --> 1:11:57.835
- Then help me get our son back.

1:12:14.678 --> 1:12:17.158
- Vladik, for old times.

1:12:22.207 --> 1:12:23.295
Thank you.

1:12:23.382 --> 1:12:24.514
- Let's do this.

1:12:38.441 --> 1:12:40.965
- Oh, shit!

1:12:41.052 --> 1:12:42.706
Look at that.

1:12:42.793 --> 1:12:44.490
If it ain't the fucking
king and queen of the prom,

1:12:44.577 --> 1:12:45.709
back together again,
look at that.

1:12:47.667 --> 1:12:49.974
Well, I guess I know what side
you've chosen, then, right?

1:12:50.061 --> 1:12:53.107
- Where's my son?
- Where's my fucking bag?

1:12:53.194 --> 1:12:54.457
- The kid first.

1:12:54.544 --> 1:12:56.589
- Get the kid.

1:12:59.287 --> 1:13:02.552
- You son of a bitch,
get him out of the cage, now.

1:13:03.727 --> 1:13:05.163
- Let him out.

1:13:11.430 --> 1:13:15.739
I gotta thank you, Rhona, for
taking care of my dirty laundry.

1:13:15.826 --> 1:13:18.132
I appreciate it.
Couldn't have done it myself.

1:13:19.612 --> 1:13:22.833
And you, you got
something for me?

1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:23.964
- Yeah.

1:13:24.051 --> 1:13:25.923
This is how it's gonna play out.

1:13:26.010 --> 1:13:28.839
She'll go get the bag.
You give us the kid.

1:13:28.926 --> 1:13:31.537
- Oh, that's how it's
gonna play out.

1:13:31.624 --> 1:13:33.844
You fucking hear him, Rhona?

1:13:33.931 --> 1:13:35.498
Move!

1:13:35.585 --> 1:13:37.282
- Go get the bag.

1:13:39.284 --> 1:13:42.374
- You know, I gotta--
I gotta be honest with you.

1:13:42.461 --> 1:13:45.899
Initially, I didn't
see the resemblance at all.

1:13:45.986 --> 1:13:49.163
Now, I mean, it's there,
clean as day, right?

1:13:49.250 --> 1:13:51.601
You squirted that outta
your dick, didn't ya?

1:13:51.688 --> 1:13:54.778
I had no fucking idea.

1:13:54.865 --> 1:13:57.215
Hell of a mom, though, Jesus.

1:13:57.302 --> 1:14:00.348
Whew, good score on that.

1:14:00.436 --> 1:14:02.873
Lucky sperm club, that kid, huh?

1:14:14.058 --> 1:14:15.712
- Is it gonna
hurt your feelings

1:14:15.799 --> 1:14:17.540
if I tell you that
I'd threw a leg over that?

1:14:17.627 --> 1:14:20.064
Would it?
Yeah, buddy.

1:14:20.151 --> 1:14:24.242
Just know, I planted my flag
on the fucking moon,

1:14:24.329 --> 1:14:26.026
and you're a cosmonaut.

1:14:26.113 --> 1:14:27.463
That feel good?

1:14:27.550 --> 1:14:29.116
- So how was the pie?

1:14:29.203 --> 1:14:32.511
- Oh, the pie, the pie
was fucking Entenmann:

1:14:32.598 --> 1:14:34.426
creamy, delicious.

1:14:34.513 --> 1:14:35.949
Fucking Entenmann.

1:14:37.995 --> 1:14:40.824
- Okay. Let's go.

1:14:45.002 --> 1:14:47.570
- That's far enough.
Right there on the table.

1:14:47.657 --> 1:14:49.310
Ricky.

1:14:54.794 --> 1:14:56.753
How we doing, Ricky?

1:14:56.840 --> 1:14:58.581
- We're good.

1:14:58.668 --> 1:15:00.234
- Right here.

1:15:03.716 --> 1:15:05.675
Let the kid go.

1:15:09.679 --> 1:15:11.028
- Let's see what we got here.

1:15:15.293 --> 1:15:16.816
What the fuck is this?

1:15:16.903 --> 1:15:18.383
Shit!

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:25.956
Get the kid!

1:16:21.272 --> 1:16:23.013
- Oh!

1:17:30.210 --> 1:17:31.516
- Ugh!

1:17:34.693 --> 1:17:36.129
- Dad!

1:17:38.828 --> 1:17:40.525
- Ah!

1:17:43.006 --> 1:17:44.355
- Hey, kid...

1:17:46.662 --> 1:17:48.359
Why don't you
go see your mom, huh?

1:17:52.668 --> 1:17:54.104
Atta boy.

1:17:54.191 --> 1:17:57.107
- Baby, are you okay?
Are you okay?

1:17:58.195 --> 1:17:59.718
Good.

1:17:59.805 --> 1:18:01.589
- It's only ever been
about you and me, right?

1:18:03.896 --> 1:18:06.072
- Go, get outta here.

1:18:06.159 --> 1:18:08.118
Get outta here,
take care of him.

1:18:11.338 --> 1:18:12.557
Go!

1:18:16.604 --> 1:18:20.739
- So tell me, buddy, how you
see this playing out, huh?

1:18:20.826 --> 1:18:23.481
- I don't know.
What do you think?

1:18:25.570 --> 1:18:26.614
- I don't know.

1:18:28.094 --> 1:18:29.226
Maybe it's time
for some of those

1:18:29.313 --> 1:18:31.402
crying hookers, though, eh?

1:18:31.489 --> 1:18:33.665
- Maybe it's just
a poor man's funeral.

1:18:40.977 --> 1:18:42.543
- Come on.

1:19:14.575 --> 1:19:17.796
- Your money's been deposited,
Banco de Mexico,

1:19:17.883 --> 1:19:20.364
Calle Monte de Herales 602,

1:19:20.451 --> 1:19:25.891
Lomas de Chapultepec,
Box 020232060832.

1:19:25.978 --> 1:19:27.632
Send me a postcard.

1:19:29.112 --> 1:19:31.854
- David? Thank you.

1:19:31.941 --> 1:19:33.507
- Be safe.

1:19:49.654 --> 1:19:54.659
- Like I said, in this business,
there is no room for mistakes.

1:19:54.746 --> 1:19:59.316
Aside from a few bumps in the
road, my plan worked perfectly.

1:19:59.403 --> 1:20:01.971
I kept the money, sold the guns,

1:20:02.058 --> 1:20:04.408
and I got my son back.

1:20:04.495 --> 1:20:09.021
Now it's time to step on the
gas and start a new life.
