Thanks a lot.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.818
- Uh, hey, guys.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.152
Mr. Hart took off,

08:41.154 --> 08:44.489
So today I am gonna be
your totally inappropriate,

08:48.529 --> 08:50.896
- Why would you come back
to visit mr. Hart?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.597
- I am asking myself
the same thing,

08:52.599 --> 08:55.467
As now I am stuck here
for the next hour.

08:55.469 --> 08:58.737
- So did you sleep
with mr. Hart?

08:58.739 --> 09:02.340

yes.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.944
I'm [bleep] with you guys.
Jeez.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.281
You cannot be that naive,
not with him.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.750
Hey, you, in the doorway.

Am I?

[school bell rings]

09:18.525 --> 09:19.558

09:19.560 --> 09:20.325
I forgot to ask--

09:20.327 --> 09:22.561
How did you pass
hart's class?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.529
- I didn't. I failed.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.665
It's hard to pass
his class

09:26.667 --> 09:28.300
When you're dating
all the wrong guys

09:28.302 --> 09:30.235
And constantly fighting
with your friends

09:30.237 --> 09:31.703
And getting your heart
ripped out.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.204
- I can relate.
- Of course you can.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.973
You're in high school.

09:34.975 --> 09:35.840
- If you failed his class,

09:35.842 --> 09:37.876
How could you stomach
seeing him again?

09:37.878 --> 09:42.347
- Because in my failure,
I found my greatest success.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.149
I found my voice.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.150
That, and he also gave me

09:45.152 --> 09:47.252
The most amazing book
I've ever read.

09:47.254 --> 09:47.852
- What book?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.421
- <i>Unraveled</i>
by russell jonathan.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.923
- He gave me that book too.
- Oh, man.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.025
That changed my life.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.126
It also made me realize

09:55.128 --> 09:57.395
That if I really
wanted something,

09:57.397 --> 10:00.732
That I should just
go after it.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.566
Good luck.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.135
- I wasn't sure I wanted
to be a member

10:04.137 --> 10:05.070
Of mr. Hart's book club,

10:05.072 --> 10:08.740
But I'd take the sage advice
that hunter gleaned from it

10:08.742 --> 10:10.475
And pass it off as my own.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.077
And that meant
I couldn't just wait

10:12.079 --> 10:14.679
For an invite
to matty's party,

10:14.681 --> 10:17.549
I had to make one.

10:17.551 --> 10:18.350
Hey.

10:18.352 --> 10:21.653
What can I bring tonight?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.155
- Just yourself.

10:31.864 --> 10:33.498
- All right, we're here.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.165
- Thank you for driving.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.167
- I didn't realize
chauffeuring was optional.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.969
- It's not. The "thank you"
was a formality.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.137
Under the terms
of your probation,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.373
You are to be our constant
designated driver

10:41.375 --> 10:42.273
Until you're told otherwise.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.476
- Probably a good idea
to keep a clear head anyway.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.912
- Uh, have you already
forgotten the rules?

10:47.914 --> 10:49.447
- [bleep].
You're right.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.149
No talking about myself.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.584
But can I at least acknowledge
how bad I feel

10:52.586 --> 10:54.319
That I didn't know
matty's parents split up,

10:54.321 --> 10:55.720
And now he's living
in a new home?

10:55.722 --> 10:58.023
- That falls within
reasonable conversation,

10:58.025 --> 10:59.357
Since it's not
all about you.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.026
It's about matty.
- I disagree.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.494
She's making it
about the fact that

11:02.496 --> 11:04.062
<i>She</i> was the last to know.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.363
- True.
Overruled.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.399
We need to stop
the conversation about you,

11:07.401 --> 11:08.433
And focus on me instead.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.669
What am I gonna do
when I run into jake?

11:10.671 --> 11:11.169

11:11.171 --> 11:12.871
- Act normal,
like nothing happened.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.439
That's the best revenge.
- Agreed.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.509
- Wait. Are you agreeing
because you agree,

11:17.511 --> 11:19.711
Or because you're
on probation?

11:19.713 --> 11:21.713
- Is that a trick question?

11:21.715 --> 11:23.114
Because I agree.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.316
I actually think
the idea is ingenious.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.785
- Good.
Then it's settled.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.086
That's what I'm gonna do.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.422

- Uh, bailey--
my new friend.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.859
Did I forget to tell you
she was meeting us?

11:34.861 --> 11:35.860
Both: Yes.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.961
- Did you invite her because

11:36.963 --> 11:38.963
You thought
we might ditch you?

11:38.965 --> 11:39.631
- No.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.999
- Probation requires honesty.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.835
- Yes. I wanted
a backup buddy.

get the soda?

We start a website,
get advertisers,
