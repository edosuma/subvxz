WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:04.169
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
I'm pregnant.

00:04.171 --> 00:05.504
This can't be.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.639
You're an unmarried queen.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.241
Then what do you suggest we do?

00:09.243 --> 00:12.044
Your Majesty,
if I may introduce myself.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.246
Lord Cunningham.
The Scots are starting to panic.

00:14.248 --> 00:17.516
Scotland needs the strength an
alliance with Spain can provide.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.119
Spain is no longer an option.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.421
DUDLEY:
<i> I had to come</i>

00:22.423 --> 00:25.124
<i> as soon as I heard</i>
<i> you'd been poisoned.</i>

00:25.126 --> 00:27.393
When I realized
I was having a miscarriage,

00:27.395 --> 00:28.794
I had to find
some place private.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.130
Someone did this to me.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.197
Three hearts.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.399
Three murders.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.700
It's going to happen again.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.035
Someone will die.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.736
(gasping)

00:39.306 --> 00:41.740
(water dripping)

00:50.684 --> 00:52.684
(rats squeaking)

00:52.686 --> 00:54.753
Dirty vermin.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.092
(squeaking)

01:00.094 --> 01:01.226
Steady now.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.766
(gasps)
Sweet God.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.272
Charles' coronation
is in a week.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.607
The surrounding villages
are all planning

01:15.609 --> 01:17.609
celebrations in his honor.

01:17.611 --> 01:21.146
I want bread and wine
delivered to every town

01:21.148 --> 01:24.149
as a show of our new king's
kindness and generosity.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.819
As master of coin,
I must inform you,

01:26.821 --> 01:28.353
the cost for the
coronation festivities

01:28.355 --> 01:29.822
has grown quite high.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.757
With coffers still low
from the Scottish war,

01:31.759 --> 01:33.358
we must be sure...

01:33.360 --> 01:35.561
To show the world
King Charles

01:35.563 --> 01:37.696
is a force to be
reckoned with.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.531
I agree, Lord Fluret.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.868
Now that the mourning period
has passed for Francis,

01:42.870 --> 01:46.772
it's time to see the House
of Valois in all its glory.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.109
And in order to do that,
we need to put on a show.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.410
CHRISTOPHE:
Your Highness.

01:51.412 --> 01:55.481
I believe this belongs to you.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.817
Your new king's guard
uniform suits you well.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.753
Thanks to the regent
for getting me hired.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.123
I want to take you right here.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.491
It's been some time now.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.326
Well, I have been
a bit preoccupied.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.695
Rest assured, I'll
make it up to you.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.866
Thank you for
retrieving my button.

02:13.868 --> 02:17.202
Butcher, where are
we with the menu

02:17.204 --> 02:18.604
for the coronation feast?

02:18.606 --> 02:21.907
500 tiny pink piglets
await slaughter.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.475
The extravagance.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.776
That cost is
unnecessary.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.345
Not for a king.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.746
Suckling pig it is.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.148
WOMAN:
Madam Regent.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.582
Oh.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.919
We agreed on pheasant.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.287
It's cheaper.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.489
Not as much fun for me.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.625
I like the squeal
of a pig.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.361
There's something not right
with you, butcher boy.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.731
My knives need sharpening.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.802
CATHERINE: I'm pleased that
you're here, Lord Narcisse.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.305
I have something for you.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.913
It's a speech.
A toast.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.615
I wrote it for you to honor me
at the coronation feast.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.951
Is this to further
my humiliation?

03:05.953 --> 03:09.254
Watching the privy council
strip you of the regency

03:09.256 --> 03:10.856
and then hand it to me
was pleasure enough.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.526
No, this is to ensure
that the world knows

03:14.528 --> 03:17.529
I have your undying support.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.866
I'm so looking forward
to hearing you deliver it,

03:20.868 --> 03:23.468
on such an
important occasion,

03:23.470 --> 03:25.804
with so many, many people
in attendance.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.907
I can hardly wait.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.277
What's happened?

03:32.279 --> 03:33.612
There was a gruesome discovery

03:36.884 --> 03:37.883
in the castle tunnels.

03:37.884 --> 03:38.883
MARY: I knew Scotland was
turning towards Protestantism,

03:38.886 --> 03:42.988
but this, this man, John Knox,
my mother hated him.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.225
He was a thorn in
Marie de Guise's side for years.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.894
And what he's written here,
it's-it's an atrocity.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.896
Such hatred
for Catholics.

03:50.898 --> 03:51.964
And women.

03:51.966 --> 03:54.600
Specifically, female monarchs.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.602
His followers grow daily.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.937
He wants a man
to rule Scotland,

03:58.939 --> 04:02.474
which does not bode well for
my return to secure my throne.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.477
But there is a way
for a woman to push back

04:05.479 --> 04:08.880
against a bully like Knox:
a strong marriage alliance.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.350
Surely with so many dignitaries
visiting for the coronation

04:11.352 --> 04:12.751
you've made some headway?

04:12.753 --> 04:16.021
Perhaps if we were to take
another course of action.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.557
King Erik of Sweden
is attending the coronation

04:18.559 --> 04:20.025
and he is in need
of a bride.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.495
Erik of Sweden is a Protestant.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.830
An interfaith marriage could
help stem the tide

04:24.832 --> 04:26.832
of anti-Catholic sentiment.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.634
It would be seen
as a gesture of tolerance.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.970
Or the move of a weakened
Catholic queen,

04:31.972 --> 04:34.506
bending to Knox
and his followers.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.842
The Vatican would
see it as a betrayal.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.710
I would no longer
have their support,

04:38.712 --> 04:40.712
no chance of asking
for money or soldiers

04:40.714 --> 04:42.381
in the time of a crisis.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.750
If you don't make
some concessions,

04:44.752 --> 04:47.786
I'm afraid you may find yourself
without a country to go back to.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.788
Perhaps.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.659
But until then, I will reach out
to another female monarch,

04:53.661 --> 04:57.863
see what she thinks of this
destabilizing force, John Knox.

04:57.865 --> 05:04.303
¶ ¶

05:04.305 --> 05:06.405
Mary, I've been looking for you.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.706
Your Majesty.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.708
I want you to take
a position of honor

05:09.710 --> 05:10.876
in my royal procession.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.879
That's very kind
of you, Charles,

05:13.881 --> 05:15.881
but it would be breaking
from tradition

05:15.883 --> 05:18.317
to have the widow of the
late king in your procession.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.486
I know it's unorthodox,
but it will show the world

05:21.488 --> 05:24.489
that France is behind you,
that I am behind you.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.359
I can think of no better way
to honor Francis

05:27.361 --> 05:29.494
than having you there
with me as I'm crowned.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.364
Then it would be
my honor as well.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.703
A woman-hating zealot
like John Knox could threaten

05:37.705 --> 05:39.705
both England and Scotland
if given the chance.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.342
I assure you, Elizabeth and
her court feel the same.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.344
Knox's teachings have gained
ground in England as well.

05:45.346 --> 05:48.747
So rest assured, you're not the
only female ruler he despises.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.849
We should form
a coalition against him.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.851
I agree.
Perhaps a common foe

05:52.853 --> 05:55.354
will finally ease tensions
with your cousin.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.723
I'll write to Elizabeth at once,
telling her of your concerns.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.726
Could you also inquire
about Lady Lola's family

06:00.728 --> 06:02.794
and the remaining
Scottish hostages?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.796
They were to be released
when Lola arrived in England,

06:04.798 --> 06:06.531
but we have heard nothing.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.533
Court business is
at a standstill

06:08.535 --> 06:10.936
while the queen is away
recuperating from her poisoning.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.373
However, I understand she's
scheduled to return home soon.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.042
Very well.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.111
That concludes
our business then.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.781
This was nice.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.750
Has been quite
some time

06:24.752 --> 06:26.084
since we've seen one another.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.919
For business.

06:27.921 --> 06:31.523
I've had no need for diplomatic
negotiations of late.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.658
So unless you have
something else

06:33.660 --> 06:35.460
of an official nature
to discuss.

06:35.462 --> 06:38.463
I do. The terms of securing
a dance with you

06:38.465 --> 06:40.432
at the coronation feast.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.434
I thought I made it quite
clear that our relationship

06:42.436 --> 06:45.036
should stick strictly
to political matters.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.038
You did. I just figured
you'd be eager

06:47.040 --> 06:49.040
to see a friendly face
on the day.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.909
Can't imagine you're
looking forward to it.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.511
Well, why would you say that?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.912
I'm quite happy for Charles.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.448
Hmm.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.752
Perhaps I am a little bit
out of sorts.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.758
It wasn't so long ago

07:06.760 --> 07:09.127
that Francis and I were being
crowned rulers of France.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.965
Now I am a guest at court,

07:13.967 --> 07:18.036
an ornamental queen,
here and in Scotland.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.039
Mary, you have to know you
mean so much more than that.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.607
You're a...
(coughing)

07:25.846 --> 07:27.846
And who do we have here?

07:27.848 --> 07:30.982
Queen Mary, let me introduce
you to my daughter, Aggy.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.652
It's Agatha.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.821
GOVERNESS:
Come now, dear. (coughs)

07:35.823 --> 07:37.522
We're heading out
for a picnic in the garden.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.191
You most certainly are not.

07:39.193 --> 07:40.859
You are unwell.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.894
Report to the infirmary
for treatment at once.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.701
Now who will take care of me?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.069
Well, me of course.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.806
What's that in your ear?

07:57.244 --> 07:59.244
May I go play
with my doll, please?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.046
Yes.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.988
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.990
I can easily charm angry queens.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.626
(scoffs) Don't be
so sure of yourself.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.095
This little girl has me
completely unnerved.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.631
Elizabeth has kept you
separated since her birth.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.633
Getting to know each other
is going to take time.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.903
Now, what have you two done
together since she arrived?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.872
Same thing
my father did with me--

08:26.874 --> 08:28.874
breakfast and
tucking in at bedtime.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.210
Oh, Gideon, you have so many
lost years to make up for.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.613
Take her out of
this stuffy castle.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.615
Go and do
something fun.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.617
Very well. Where are we going?

08:38.619 --> 08:39.951
"We"?

08:39.953 --> 08:42.287
You were a little girl once.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.289
You know what little girls like.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.659
Not to mention you did just
relieve me of my governess.

08:50.898 --> 08:54.566
BASH:
The man was a castle squire
who disappeared a few days ago.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.234
It was only
when we dug him up

08:56.236 --> 08:57.669
we discovered
the other body.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.937
The woman was
highborn.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.006
Previous victims were left
to be discovered.

09:02.976 --> 09:06.845
He's hiding them, burying
them beneath the castle.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.179
How is he getting
the bodies

09:08.181 --> 09:10.181
into the tunnels
without being seen?

09:10.183 --> 09:12.284
I don't know,
but I will find out.

09:12.286 --> 09:16.187
CATHERINE: This coronation
is meant to celebrate Charles,

09:16.189 --> 09:19.190
a strong king with a
powerful regent at his side.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.794
Well, this certainly doesn't
look good for you, Catherine--

09:22.796 --> 09:25.664
having a killer on the loose
on such an important occasion

09:25.666 --> 09:28.199
with so many, many people
in attendance.

09:28.201 --> 09:32.270
Perhaps I should make some
alterations to my speech.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.106
(coughs)

09:36.176 --> 09:38.276
CATHERINE:
I assure you all,

09:38.278 --> 09:40.612
you are safe here in the castle
for the coronation.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.948
We will have every
available king's guard

09:42.950 --> 09:45.250
hunting around the clock.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.020
I have the situation
under control.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.825
16 livre, not an ounce more.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.035
(creaking)

10:06.039 --> 10:08.106
(creaking)

10:11.311 --> 10:13.845
Is someone there?

10:20.220 --> 10:22.387
(grunts)

10:29.696 --> 10:31.096
What on earth are we doing,

10:31.098 --> 10:33.164
traveling in this
rattrap of a carriage?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.100
I apologize for your discomfort.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.368
It's certainly
not befitting

10:36.370 --> 10:38.203
a queen's official
return to court.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.238
But we have to travel undercover
for your own safety.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.373
My safety?

10:41.375 --> 10:42.907
The last time
your royal coach

10:42.909 --> 10:44.342
journeyed from the castle,

10:44.344 --> 10:45.710
it was pelted with stones

10:45.712 --> 10:47.212
and rotten food.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.381
I see public opinion has
not been kind in my absence.

10:49.383 --> 10:52.384
Rumors persist that
Robert Dudley was your lover,

10:52.386 --> 10:53.985
that he murdered his wife
to be with you.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.987
Does no one
accept the truth?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.389
Amy Dudley committed suicide,

10:57.391 --> 10:59.658
and Robert was cleared
of all charges.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.395
What news have you of Dudley?

11:03.397 --> 11:05.196
Some nobles learned
of his location,

11:05.198 --> 11:06.731
and chased him
from the county.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.400
The stain on his reputation
has not abated.

11:08.402 --> 11:10.435
You must stay clear of him.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.737
(horse neighs)

11:12.739 --> 11:15.774
Why is more attention being paid
to vicious gossip

11:15.776 --> 11:18.810
than the true terror at hand?

11:18.812 --> 11:22.147
What progress have you made
in finding my poisoner?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.281
I will hunt down
the perpetrator,

11:23.283 --> 11:24.416
but I need more time.

11:24.418 --> 11:25.417
Considering public opinion

11:25.419 --> 11:26.451
has turned against you,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.286
there's no shortage of suspects.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.789
Wonderful news.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.290
Ambassador Blackburn
sent a letter

11:32.292 --> 11:34.426
expressing Mary, Queen of Scots'
deep concerns

11:34.428 --> 11:37.295
about the Protestant agitator,
John Knox.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.030
Knox.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.067
What a hateful, little man.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.334
She's hoping to discuss
combining your efforts

11:43.336 --> 11:44.969
to push him back.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.906
She suggests that it would
benefit both of you

11:47.908 --> 11:49.841
considering his loathing
of female monarchs.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.077
It's an interesting offer.

11:52.079 --> 11:55.814
But I can't afford to alienate
my Protestant supporters.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.849
Mary's eagerness
to discuss Knox

11:57.851 --> 11:59.918
does smack of one thing,
however.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.288
She's planning
a return to Scotland.

12:03.290 --> 12:08.259
Perhaps it's time to pay
my Scottish houseguest a visit.

12:08.261 --> 12:11.096
(lively music playing,
people talking happily)

12:11.098 --> 12:12.297
(chittering)

12:16.970 --> 12:19.804
I don't think I ever saw
the world with such awe.

12:19.806 --> 12:23.041
MARY:
The world through a child's eyes
is a marvelous thing.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.242
(camel grunting)

12:24.244 --> 12:25.910
AGATHA:
What is it?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.912
A camel.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.014
This is the first one
I've seen up close.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.483
Rather ugly,
isn't it?

12:31.485 --> 12:33.752
I think it's beautiful.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.220
MAN:
There are more animals inside!

12:35.222 --> 12:37.255
Do you want to go in?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.124
I can go with you
if you're nervous.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.893
I prefer to go alone,
but I need my doll.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.928
I left her
in the carriage.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.030
I'll go get her for you.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.972
(indistinct chatter)

12:56.176 --> 12:58.977
Oh, red becomes
you, my lady.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.146
It's yours for
three deniers.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.848
And I'd wager it'd look just
as pretty on you, little girl.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.350
Here.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.851
(gasps)

13:06.853 --> 13:09.320
As beautiful
as your mother.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.968
I wish you were...

13:23.970 --> 13:26.037
my mother.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.273
MARY: Oh, Agatha,
that's very sweet.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.508
But I would like to be
your very good friend.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.043
And don't forget
about your father.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.411
He loves you very much.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.579
Yes, I know.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.582
But he has to do
what the queen says.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.417
Do you mean Queen Elizabeth?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.152
If you were my mother,
you would never leave me,

13:41.154 --> 13:43.955
because no one
can tell a queen what to do.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.394
Are you afraid Queen Elizabeth

13:49.396 --> 13:51.963
is going to take you away
from your father again?

13:56.002 --> 13:58.436
I understand
that you're scared.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.538
Even queens are
afraid sometimes.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.608
But we can't allow our fear
to control us.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.044
It doesn't seem
like it now,

14:06.046 --> 14:09.214
but your father
is your greatest protector.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.550
Do you think you can
give him a chance?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.954
Here you are.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.288
Father?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.123
Will you come
with me, instead?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.227
I would like that very much.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.397
(short laugh)

14:35.208 --> 14:36.641
LOLA:
<i> You didn't bring me here</i>

14:36.643 --> 14:38.409
<i> so Mary could get</i>
<i> to know you better.</i>

14:38.411 --> 14:40.378
You want information about Mary.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.412
Yes.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.414
When does Mary hope

14:43.416 --> 14:45.216
to return to Scotland?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.885
Has she spoken to her generals?

14:46.887 --> 14:49.187
Fine.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.156
If you are not abreast of
Mary's military operations,

14:52.158 --> 14:54.392
let's discuss
affairs of the heart.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.928
King Charles' coronation
is imminent.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.464
French court is awash
with royalty.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.366
Who of the suitors
does Mary hope to entertain

15:01.368 --> 15:03.635
in her search
for a new marriage alliance?

15:03.637 --> 15:06.304
You can't expect me
to tell you these things.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.106
Mary is my friend.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.309
Well, I was hoping that we, too,
could become friends, Lola.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.977
Friends don't just stay
at each other's homes

15:12.979 --> 15:14.579
and buy each other
pretty dresses.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.381
They do each other favors.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.316
And what if I don't?

15:19.519 --> 15:22.186
Well, we will find ourselves
at an impasse.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.189
And that I cannot have.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.593
You leave me no choice.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.629
Your family
will stay behind bars,

15:31.631 --> 15:33.364
and your stay here
at English court

15:33.366 --> 15:36.267
will become
a little less comfortable.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.405
Until you're
willing to talk.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.382
Shh, not here.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.185
Where we used to meet.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.454
But they've since
put a lock on it.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.589
Give me the key.

15:58.591 --> 16:02.193
You can get yourself
another, can't you?

16:02.195 --> 16:05.063
Yes, but this lover--

16:06.199 --> 16:08.266
I'm making twice what I used to.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.468
Now I can buy you things.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.004
That'll be nice,
won't it?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.340
Just don't show them
to your husband.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.287
(door closes)

16:29.289 --> 16:31.155
Christophe, where
have you been?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.490
My lord, uh,
apologies, I...

16:32.492 --> 16:33.758
I ordered all
of the king's guard

16:33.760 --> 16:34.993
to stand by
and await orders.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.294
That includes you.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.662
Lord Fluret has
gone missing.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.564
There are signs of a
struggle in his chambers.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.432
You think it was the killer.

16:41.434 --> 16:45.703
Which is why I need you on duty,
not wandering the halls.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.405
Listen.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.607
I don't care that Catherine
appointed you to this position

16:49.609 --> 16:51.476
because of her favor, but

16:51.478 --> 16:53.277
you must take
this job seriously.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.346
Show people you are
worthy of the post you hold,

16:55.348 --> 16:57.448
and no one will remember
how you rose to it.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.619
My lord,
I heard you've asked

17:01.621 --> 17:03.588
for volunteers
to take night patrols.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.556
I used to tend fires
in the east wing.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.325
No one knows it better.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.726
Let me patrol there.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.728
Give me a chance
to prove myself.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.567
I get a thrill using the key

17:16.569 --> 17:19.570
to Catherine de Medici's
chambers.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.205
I'm thrilled you're
not covered in cobwebs

17:21.207 --> 17:23.674
from using
the secret passageways.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.810
Did anyone see you?

17:25.812 --> 17:28.546
No, but what does it matter?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.815
I'm here on official business.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.151
Did the king's guard
find Lord Fluret?

17:33.153 --> 17:34.419
Not yet.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.820
Several nobles
have left the castle,

17:35.822 --> 17:37.588
fearing for their safety.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.624
And still no progress

17:39.626 --> 17:41.826
in our search
for the killer.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.098
You look so beautiful in that.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.267
Thank you.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.269
I've decided on another.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.772
It reminds me
of the last time I wore it.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.675
Francis' coronation.

17:57.677 --> 18:01.546
I don't want that sadness
hanging over Charles' day.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.650
Why wear a lesser piece?

18:05.652 --> 18:08.219
(sighs)

18:10.290 --> 18:12.156
Because, Christophe,

18:12.158 --> 18:15.693
it reminds me of my dead son.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.529
In some ways you are
every bit the man,

18:18.531 --> 18:21.132
and in others,
you are still so young.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.571
Once you have children,

18:26.573 --> 18:27.805
you come to realize
that you've never

18:27.807 --> 18:29.774
known true love before.

18:36.316 --> 18:40.384
When you lose a child,
you come to know true pain.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.593
I don't know your pain,

18:48.595 --> 18:51.229
but I make it a point
never to look back.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.467
Why would you
when there's so much beauty

18:56.469 --> 18:58.136
right in front of you?

19:05.845 --> 19:08.346
You've added another key.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.380
One for the king's
guard storage.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.216
One for<i> my</i> chambers.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.651
Your quarters don't have a lock.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.354
Have you taken a new lover?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.222
An old one.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.657
Are you angry?

19:19.659 --> 19:20.925
No.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.760
I just want
to be certain

19:22.762 --> 19:23.861
that there's
no lover's talk

19:23.863 --> 19:26.230
between you.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.733
You know that no one
can know about us.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.737
(insects trilling)

19:32.739 --> 19:35.606
I heard Elizabeth
could be mercurial,

19:35.608 --> 19:38.176
erratic even, but this?

19:38.178 --> 19:40.344
This is a very difficult time
for the queen.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.747
Her life is so lonely.

19:42.749 --> 19:46.284
You mean without
her wife-murdering lover?

19:46.286 --> 19:49.921
What the nobles say
about Robert Dudley isn't true.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.191
He's a kind man.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.927
And his wife, the one
everyone's feeling so sorry for?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.728
You should've seen the way
she'd lash out at the servants.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.730
If you ask me, loads of people
could've murdered her.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.399
Meanwhile, Lord Dudley
is the only person

20:01.401 --> 20:03.401
poor Elizabeth can trust.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.503
It's not right that the
world is against them.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.872
Understood.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.474
Here, I brought you
some plums

20:10.476 --> 20:11.509
from dinner.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.710
I know how you love them.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.412
No, no, my lady!

20:14.414 --> 20:15.380
I can do that.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.347
Nonsense, your hands
are covered in soot.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.652
What's this?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.722
A wig of this quality
would cost a small fortune.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.823
It's nothing.
And the color.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.392
Elizabeth.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.927
Did you steal it?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.629
I would never.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.797
My friend was a courtesan here.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.232
She asked me
to deliver it

20:34.234 --> 20:35.333
to someone as a favor.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.434
I've-I've done nothing wrong.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.468
Are you sure this doesn't have

20:37.470 --> 20:38.803
something to do with the queen?

20:38.805 --> 20:41.539
No, but...

20:41.541 --> 20:44.342
it has to do with
someone close to her.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.678
You won't believe
unless you see it

20:47.680 --> 20:49.247
with your own eyes.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.785
WOMAN:
I'm new to this, my lord.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.823
What is it you
want me to do?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.024
WILLIAM:
Where's the wig?

21:00.026 --> 21:02.026
Do we really need it?
Yes.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.495
Next time, be sure to wear it.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.863
Now, stop talking.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.698
(woman moans sensually)

21:07.700 --> 21:09.634
Elizabeth.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.303
Oh, Elizabeth.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.980
(horse whinnying)

21:25.351 --> 21:28.019
I'll never be able to repay you
for this kindness.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.655
There's nothing to repay.

21:30.657 --> 21:34.659
You two would have come to this
moment on your own eventually.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.927
As much as it saddens
me to say it,

21:36.929 --> 21:38.929
this sweet respite must end.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.065
It's time to accept my fate.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.334
What is that?

21:43.336 --> 21:45.403
The pursuit of a marriage
alliance with Erik of Sweden.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.772
A Protestant prince?

21:47.774 --> 21:50.007
My advisors think
it will appease

21:50.009 --> 21:53.077
John Knox and his followers,
so I may return to Scotland.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.413
Mm. What do you think?

21:55.415 --> 21:58.082
I think I would be
betraying who I am.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.784
And it's difficult.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.019
Any more difficult than being
mistaken for her mother?

22:02.021 --> 22:06.424
I can only assume you wanted a
child of your own with Francis.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.759
Being confronted with
that pain today must have

22:08.761 --> 22:11.095
seemed insurmountable,
but you rose above it

22:11.097 --> 22:13.698
and still found a way
to help Agatha... and me.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.733
Now, you need to
help yourself.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.435
You're a queen, Mary.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.736
And you must do
whatever you need to

22:18.738 --> 22:20.438
in order to achieve
that purpose.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.740
If this Swedish prince
helps you do it,

22:22.742 --> 22:25.443
then... go get him.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.878
You know, you're encouraging me
to align myself

22:27.880 --> 22:29.580
with a very powerful husband,

22:29.582 --> 22:31.582
and your queen's orders
are to prevent it.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.584
(chuckles)

22:33.586 --> 22:35.920
Those were my orders
as a diplomat.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.489
I'm speaking to you tonight
as a friend.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.125
Although, I hear
Erik's a bore,

22:41.127 --> 22:42.126
smells like day-old mackerel.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.728
And Sweden's a block of ice.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.129
(chuckles)

22:49.402 --> 22:52.470
(pigs oinking)

22:52.472 --> 22:54.472
(pig squealing)

22:54.474 --> 22:57.742
(knife slices)

22:57.744 --> 22:59.744
(pig gasping)

23:07.553 --> 23:10.621
CHRISTOPHE:<i> I didn't like the</i>
<i> pleasure he took in the kill.</i>

23:10.623 --> 23:13.457
But that's what butchers
do, they butcher animals.

23:13.459 --> 23:14.992
It's probably nothing,

23:14.994 --> 23:16.961
but I also saw the butcher
arguing with Lord Fluret

23:16.963 --> 23:18.496
just before he went missing.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.564
What about?

23:20.566 --> 23:23.567
The coronation menu,
but it turned personal quickly.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.437
Hardly a reason
to inspire murder.

23:26.439 --> 23:29.707
Well, if the butcher isn't a
murderer, he's at least a thief.

23:29.709 --> 23:32.943
Tonight I saw him stealing
a salt barrel from the larder.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.147
Salt?

23:36.149 --> 23:38.582
Yes, his chambers are connected
to the slaughterhouse,

23:38.584 --> 23:39.917
and he rolled it right in.

23:39.919 --> 23:44.422
A barrel of salt is worth
almost a year's wages.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.024
Salt isn't just valuable.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.096
It's also used
to preserve meat.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.632
CHRISTOPHE:
Ugh.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.767
They always smell like this?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.936
Only if they're left
in the open.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.539
If they were
stored in salt,

24:01.541 --> 24:04.508
the telltale larder
would be diminished,

24:04.510 --> 24:06.477
buying the killer time
until he could bury them.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.046
Salt.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.886
Only trace amounts.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.656
How large was this barrel?

24:18.658 --> 24:21.058
Large enough to hold a body?
Yes.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.560
Then perhaps that's
how he moved them

24:22.562 --> 24:24.562
into tunnels
without being noticed.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.930
Let's go visit
his chambers.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.636
¶ ¶

24:34.574 --> 24:36.640
(flies buzzing)

24:46.586 --> 24:48.652
There's something in here.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.591
I've seen these before.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.260
In the barn with Delphine
when we were hunting the killer.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.828
He keeps the hearts in these.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.806
Bash.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.149
CHRISTOPHE:
Good God, is that...?

25:26.792 --> 25:27.992
Lord Fluret.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.594
(door opens)
BUTCHER: Who's in here?

25:30.596 --> 25:31.896
What are you doing?

25:31.898 --> 25:33.230
These are my chambers.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.000
BUTCHER:
What is that?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.167
Put down the knife,
and we'll talk.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.769
You think I did this.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.004
Want to string me up
like a pig.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.273
I can't let that happen.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.544
(grunting)

25:50.182 --> 25:52.983
(grunting)

26:02.662 --> 26:04.929
BASH:
Stop fighting.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.864
I'm done! I'm done.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.778
I was pleased to hear
you wanted to speak again.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.780
Have you had a change of heart?

26:22.782 --> 26:26.116
Are you ready to tell me all you
know of Mary, Queen of Scots?

26:26.118 --> 26:28.852
I'm afraid not.

26:28.854 --> 26:31.855
But I do have other information
you may find of use.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.924
Go on.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.729
Over the past
several weeks here,

26:38.731 --> 26:42.633
I have heard whispers
about a gentleman

26:42.635 --> 26:46.070
who was... uh,
a favorite of yours.

26:46.072 --> 26:49.206
Your own nobles and advisors
wished him to disappear,

26:49.208 --> 26:52.009
and this has caused
you great pain.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.812
Proceed with caution, Lady Lola.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.950
I will tell you
one thing about Mary.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.052
She surrounds herself
with people who are invested

27:02.054 --> 27:04.722
in her contentment.
True friends.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.223
True advisors.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.691
As any queen should.

27:07.693 --> 27:09.026
As do I.

27:10.363 --> 27:12.029
I don't believe that you do.

27:12.031 --> 27:16.367
What is it that
you think you know?

27:16.369 --> 27:20.904
And what does it have to do with
my "favorite," as you call him?

27:22.108 --> 27:24.642
Actually, Your Majesty,

27:24.644 --> 27:26.710
it has to do with Lord William.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.989
Elizabeth.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.290
What on earth?

27:40.292 --> 27:42.860
Why are you
so shocked?

27:42.862 --> 27:45.162
Isn't this what
you've always wanted,

27:45.164 --> 27:47.164
your wife away at
her country home

27:47.166 --> 27:50.167
and me here in
your chambers?

27:50.169 --> 27:52.169
(chuckles)

27:52.171 --> 27:53.737
What are you
talking about?

27:53.739 --> 27:55.739
I know of the courtesan.

27:55.741 --> 27:58.742
I know of the red wig
you make her wear

27:58.744 --> 28:00.744
and how you call out my name

28:00.746 --> 28:02.980
in the throes of passion
as you bed her.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.716
Where have you heard
such a thing?

28:05.718 --> 28:07.718
There's no use denying it.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.453
(scoffs)

28:10.956 --> 28:12.823
And to think,
all these years,

28:12.825 --> 28:16.226
I believed you were motivated
by love of country.

28:17.430 --> 28:19.730
And now I know otherwise.

28:19.732 --> 28:21.699
You're in love with me.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.033
But I never acted on it.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.768
You sound as though
you had a chance.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.737
There were
times I did.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.305
Times when Dudley
was out of your life

28:28.307 --> 28:29.973
and you wanted more
from me than counsel.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.308
I could have
become your lover,

28:31.310 --> 28:32.976
but I didn't
because I'm married,

28:32.978 --> 28:35.045
and that fact alone
would bring shame upon you.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.082
I knew it, and Dudley,
your married lover, did, too,

28:38.084 --> 28:39.450
and he didn't care.

28:39.452 --> 28:41.452
He would do anything for me.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.454
You think
he loves you,

28:43.456 --> 28:44.988
but real love
is sacrifice,

28:44.990 --> 28:46.990
and I've sacrificed
my own emotions,

28:46.992 --> 28:50.194
pushed them away time and again
to protect you.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.396
There is nothing, absolutely
nothing, I wouldn't do

28:52.398 --> 28:55.399
to keep you
on the throne.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.801
Even murder my unborn child?

29:00.206 --> 29:02.806
You knew I was pregnant.

29:02.808 --> 29:06.076
I swear, I didn't know.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.079
I spoke with the courtesan

29:09.081 --> 29:11.181
whom you most recently visited.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.451
She led me to the girl
who she'd replaced,

29:14.453 --> 29:17.454
the girl you sent away
just two months earlier.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.457
Right after she helped
you find a potion

29:20.459 --> 29:24.762
that whores use to dispose
of unwanted problems.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.533
You poisoned me
so I'd lose my baby.

29:29.535 --> 29:33.504
I did it to protect you
and save your reign.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.506
You had no right!

29:35.508 --> 29:38.008
It was my child.

29:39.245 --> 29:41.545
(sobbing):
You had no right.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.113
Elizabeth.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.948
Please.

29:50.489 --> 29:54.224
You will be leaving
my service at once.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.462
And you will not return.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.500
I'm immensely relieved
that you've caught him.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.502
Congratulations, Sebastian.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.372
Well, I must give credit
where it is due.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.374
Without Christophe's
watchful eye spotting

30:10.376 --> 30:13.243
the butcher moving
the barrel of salt,

30:13.245 --> 30:14.912
I'm not sure
we'd have apprehended him.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.914
And you're sure
he's the right man?

30:16.916 --> 30:18.182
If finding Fluret's
corpse in his chambers

30:18.184 --> 30:19.483
wasn't evidence enough,

30:19.485 --> 30:21.051
only two people
have keys

30:21.053 --> 30:22.920
to the larder
where the salt is kept.

30:22.922 --> 30:25.355
The butcher himself
and the castle baker.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.924
And the baker can't
be the killer.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.458
His leg is badly atrophied,

30:28.460 --> 30:30.093
leaving him incapable
of moving a heavy salt barrel,

30:30.095 --> 30:31.461
much less a body inside.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.931
Did you say the baker?

30:33.933 --> 30:34.932
I did.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.099
What's wrong?

30:36.101 --> 30:38.502
Nothing.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.938
¶ ¶

31:03.495 --> 31:05.562
¶ ¶

31:18.477 --> 31:20.544
(creaking)

31:29.455 --> 31:31.088
(clicks)

31:35.928 --> 31:37.995
(creaking)

31:51.677 --> 31:53.410
(door closes)

31:53.412 --> 31:55.012
Christophe.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.147
(door locks)

31:58.284 --> 32:01.151
So... (laughs)

32:01.153 --> 32:02.920
you've figured it out.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.156
This was all your doing.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.593
I thought I had buried
the bodies deep enough.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.663
Guess there's no accounting
for hungry rats.

32:12.665 --> 32:15.065
When they unearthed
your handiwork,

32:15.067 --> 32:17.134
you needed to find a scapegoat.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.569
That's when you rekindled your
affair with the baker's wife,

32:19.571 --> 32:21.038
so you could get her key.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.574
So you could frame
that odd butcher.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.311
Except I never used salt barrels

32:27.313 --> 32:29.179
to move my victims.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.081
I carried them myself,

32:31.083 --> 32:32.349
in the dark of night.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.217
You went back

32:34.219 --> 32:36.153
and put salt on the squire

32:36.155 --> 32:38.488
and the highborn woman's
corpses after the fact

32:38.490 --> 32:41.325
to steer the search
in that direction.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.327
How did you catch onto me?

32:43.329 --> 32:45.963
By getting to know you.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.364
Your inability
to understand

32:47.366 --> 32:49.333
that I mourned my son

32:49.335 --> 32:51.168
and the way
you approach me

32:51.170 --> 32:52.569
with disregard for my station.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.638
At first, I credited that

32:54.640 --> 32:56.640
to youth and daring.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.376
Then I realized that
you don't lack fear,

32:59.378 --> 33:01.178
you lack a conscience.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.417
The butcher man is innocent.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.252
That butcher is no innocent.

33:09.254 --> 33:12.189
I've seen
the way he kills.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.423
He likes it.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.625
And am I your next victim?

33:19.264 --> 33:21.198
I would never hurt you,
Catherine.

33:22.735 --> 33:25.102
And I know
you would never hurt me.

33:27.072 --> 33:30.040
I only slept with
the baker's wife for the key.

33:30.042 --> 33:32.676
I said unkind things
about you to her,

33:32.678 --> 33:34.578
and I'm sorry for that.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.346
You're sorry

33:36.348 --> 33:39.549
that you said unkind things...

33:39.551 --> 33:42.419
when you are a murderer.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.122
Shh...

33:46.425 --> 33:47.758
Don't tell anyone.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.333
I know you won't, because

33:56.335 --> 33:58.168
(whispers):
it's a secret.

34:01.473 --> 34:05.142
And I know a secret
of yours as well.

34:07.312 --> 34:12.215
You had your daughter,
Claude, beaten

34:12.217 --> 34:16.286
so that you could steal
the regency back from Narcisse.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.091
I overheard you
plotting in your chambers

34:21.093 --> 34:23.326
with Duke Boinel
when I was coming through

34:23.328 --> 34:25.562
the secret passageway
to meet you one night.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.398
There's someone else
who was there as well

34:28.400 --> 34:30.167
who can bear witness, if needed;

34:30.169 --> 34:31.668
I'll never say who.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.704
But I could bring down
your regency for good.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.793
I usually have to cut
the heart out to possess it.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.595
(laughs)

35:01.166 --> 35:03.400
But yours is already mine.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.535
You can't stay here, Christophe.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.704
Not with what I know.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.707
I can, and I will.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.810
And if you were
to stop me...

35:13.812 --> 35:15.512
if I were to turn up dead

35:15.514 --> 35:17.781
or simply disappear...

35:17.783 --> 35:20.517
a letter will be delivered

35:20.519 --> 35:24.221
outlining your dealings
with Duke Boinel.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.389
Now, get up.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.325
The castle needs
its killer punished.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.595
You know what you must do.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.565
(creaking)

35:35.567 --> 35:38.301
(exhales)

35:45.377 --> 35:48.712
(people murmuring)

35:48.714 --> 35:51.448
BASH:
The butcher still insists
on his innocence.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.217
As all men do before they swing.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.589
(sniffling)

36:04.696 --> 36:06.763
(people exclaiming)

36:08.934 --> 36:10.667
(indistinct conversation)

36:18.277 --> 36:19.776
I have something for you.

36:19.778 --> 36:22.679
Francis was so nervous
during his coronation,

36:22.681 --> 36:24.381
his palms so sweaty,

36:24.383 --> 36:26.650
that when the cardinal placed
the scepter in his hand,

36:26.652 --> 36:28.585
it almost slipped to the floor.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.420
After that,
he never attended

36:30.422 --> 36:34.224
another ceremony without this
tucked into his sleeve.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.592
Now, it's yours
to keep.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.494
Hold onto it tightly

36:37.496 --> 36:38.728
and it will keep your hands dry.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.764
That is the most helpful
piece of advice

36:40.766 --> 36:42.432
anyone has given me today.

36:43.502 --> 36:44.601
I'm glad you're here.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.969
As am I.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.273
¶ We lay down in the riverbed ¶
It's time.

36:50.275 --> 36:54.711
¶ Rested the silhouettes ¶

36:54.713 --> 36:59.883
¶ Our fathers and mothers
lay before ¶

36:59.885 --> 37:06.890
¶ We are kings and queens
and vagabonds ¶

37:06.892 --> 37:13.330
¶ We are kings
and queens and vagabonds ¶

37:13.332 --> 37:17.834
¶ We came up
with the firelight ¶

37:17.836 --> 37:20.770
¶ Raised in the black of night ¶

37:20.772 --> 37:25.408
¶ Falling like angels
to the floor ¶

37:27.512 --> 37:33.650
¶ We are kings and queens
and vagabonds ¶

37:33.652 --> 37:39.256
¶ Ah, ah-ah... ¶

37:39.258 --> 37:42.459
¶ We are kings ¶

37:42.461 --> 37:46.563
¶ And queens and vagabonds ¶

37:48.800 --> 37:52.535
¶ Ah, ah, ah ¶

37:52.537 --> 37:55.805
¶ Hey, ah... ¶

37:55.807 --> 37:57.874
(dancing music playing,
chatter, laughter)

38:13.292 --> 38:14.758
(clinking)

38:14.760 --> 38:18.028
May I have your attention,
please!

38:18.030 --> 38:21.831
A toast
to Catherine de Medici,

38:21.833 --> 38:26.002
Queen Mother
and Regent of France.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.772
A woman of great honor,

38:28.774 --> 38:31.875
defender of her people,
protector of the realm.

38:31.877 --> 38:35.345
May the entire Valois family

38:35.347 --> 38:38.748
and this great nation of France
rest easy

38:38.750 --> 38:42.619
in her exceptional care.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.920
To Catherine.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.524
ALL:
To Catherine!

38:47.526 --> 38:49.926
To Catherine.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.596
(music resumes playing)

39:11.350 --> 39:14.517
I've been looking for
you, Lord Cunningham.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.887
I am ready to meet
Erik of Sweden.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.123
If you would arrange
an introduction?

39:20.125 --> 39:22.659
I'm afraid a marriage alliance
with a Protestant ruler

39:22.661 --> 39:24.361
will no longer serve your needs.

39:24.363 --> 39:25.729
I've just learned

39:25.731 --> 39:27.097
that John Knox and his followers

39:27.099 --> 39:29.065
have stormed the gates
of Edinburgh Castle

39:29.067 --> 39:30.567
<i> in an act of protest--</i>

39:30.569 --> 39:32.035
<i> their numbers so vast</i>

39:32.037 --> 39:33.470
<i> your brother James,</i>
<i> even as regent,</i>

39:33.472 --> 39:34.471
was reluctant to punish

39:34.473 --> 39:35.638
their treasonous act.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.940
Treasonous?

39:36.942 --> 39:39.809
(shouting)

39:39.811 --> 39:42.145
CUNNINGHAM:
<i>They have burned you in effigy.</i>

39:43.915 --> 39:46.616
<i> And now, Knox has issued</i>
<i> an ultimatum.</i>

39:46.618 --> 39:47.951
They will not accept your rule,

39:47.953 --> 39:49.719
or your return to Scotland,

39:49.721 --> 39:51.721
unless you agree to convert
to Protestantism.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.058
(sighs)

39:56.962 --> 39:58.795
No.

40:00.465 --> 40:03.933
I have lived my entire life
as a Catholic queen.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.936
I will not allow Knox
to bully me

40:06.938 --> 40:08.638
into being something I am not.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.039
Not now. Not ever.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.643
I will not be chased
out of my country

40:13.645 --> 40:15.545
before I've even returned.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.846
What will you do?

40:18.750 --> 40:20.984
Fight fire with fire.

40:22.421 --> 40:25.955
I came to thank you for the new
governess you sent for Agatha.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.858
(clears throat)

40:28.860 --> 40:31.795
I know what you're doing.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.165
You're going to the Vatican.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.966
You certainly are good

40:36.968 --> 40:38.535
at your spy work, aren't you?

40:38.537 --> 40:41.037
I'm going to ask
the Vatican for funds

40:41.039 --> 40:43.206
to wage war against John Knox.
Mm.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.775
He's trying to take my country.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.877
Targeting Catholics,
persecuting them.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.913
Burning homes,
looting monasteries.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.614
I can't allow it.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.783
Queen Elizabeth will see
your raising a Catholic army

40:53.785 --> 40:55.485
as an act of aggression.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.620
The Vatican has been
determined to reclaim England

40:57.622 --> 40:59.122
ever since she turned
the country Protestant

40:59.124 --> 41:00.523
after Mary Tudor died.

41:00.525 --> 41:02.759
I know this will
infuriate Elizabeth.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.894
This is about
John Knox, a Scot,

41:04.896 --> 41:06.496
trying to take what is mine.

41:06.498 --> 41:08.631
And you were right.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.067
I need to embrace my purpose.

41:11.069 --> 41:12.802
Reclaim my power.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.505
I am a queen
and a fighter,

41:15.507 --> 41:18.007
and a woman who will stop
at nothing to save Scotland.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.509
I never said to raise an army.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.777
But I must.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.779
Mary, if you bring
a Catholic force

41:22.781 --> 41:24.147
to fight on the British Isles,

41:24.149 --> 41:25.815
our countries may
never be at peace.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.884
The day may come
when we, you and I,

41:27.886 --> 41:29.552
find ourselves
facing off

41:29.554 --> 41:32.255
against each other
across a battlefield.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.859
What would you do then?

41:37.028 --> 41:39.562
I will be forced
to strike you down.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.586
GIRL:
<i> Oh, no.</i>
