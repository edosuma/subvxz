Birdie, your bag's huge.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.225
It's not good for you to carry
around all that weight.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.879
And it's not good for you

00:09.922 --> 00:11.837
to wheel your books around like
you're going to the airport.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.317
Don't be that kid.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.753

You don't want them calling you

00:16.625 --> 00:18.757
Didn't they call you
Sweaty Betty through college?

00:18.801 --> 00:21.325
Hey, I told you that
in confidence.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.110
Fine, I'll switch it out.

00:23.153 --> 00:26.200
Hey, you want me to pick up
the girls from school today?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.505
I think I finally figured out

00:27.549 --> 00:29.333
which direction
the carpool lane goes.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.856
That's okay.
Aubrey has debate

00:30.900 --> 00:33.250
and this one signed up for
wrestling despite my wishes.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.165
Off the top ropes!
Ah!

00:35.209 --> 00:36.427
Make sure you do that
every time.

00:36.471 --> 00:37.733
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.343
You want to go
down to the golf course

00:39.387 --> 00:41.345
and pretend sneeze
at people's backswings?

00:41.389 --> 00:43.347
Ah, I love doing that, man,
but no can do.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.393
That fine teller
works at the bank today,

00:45.436 --> 00:47.264
so I gotta go down there
and pretend to open an account

00:47.308 --> 00:48.700
so I can "plan for my future."

00:48.744 --> 00:49.919

Oh, well, yeah,
that's perfect.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.617

a bigger one?

00:52.661 --> 00:55.403
- You're gonna get roasted.
- Let them talk.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.144
You want me to come down
there and talk to them for ya?

00:57.187 --> 00:58.406
No thanks.

00:58.449 --> 01:01.191
Did you just offer
to confront some tweens?

01:01.235 --> 01:02.453
Oh, my God, no.
That's crazy.

No, never mind.

I'm headed out myself.

I got a...big meeting.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.430
It's not just about
her looks.

It's also her power and money,
and then looks.

I'll be fine.

No, I also voted for Kanye.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.450
And I haven't had to use
the head scratching signal

02:26.494 --> 02:28.191
since the audience turned on me
for voting for Kanye.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.279
You know what
I'm talking about?

02:29.323 --> 02:30.237
Yeah, they hated that
so much.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.716
Yeah, that was worse than

02:31.760 --> 02:33.588
when I came back from Jamaica
with my hair braided.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.242
Mm, the audience did not
like that.

- Mm-mm.

- I won't.
- I don't know, Mika.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.726
I mean, everybody does
the in-studio politician thing.

02:41.770 --> 02:45.295
It's boring, but Gary told me
about this new spot, L&W.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.862
Maybe we do
the interview there,

if things go sideways

Would you have
any say in that as a mayor?

16:18.586 --> 16:20.631
I really don't know
what naming all the Reginas
