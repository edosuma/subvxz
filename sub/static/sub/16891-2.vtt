00:03.200 --> 00:04.501
<i>Previously:</i>

00:04.501 --> 00:06.701
She... She's beautiful.

00:06.701 --> 00:08.032
She's dead.

00:08.032 --> 00:09.267
You wouldn't have known

00:09.267 --> 00:11.734
if I was holding her
or if she was holding me.

00:11.734 --> 00:14.033
That's how incredible
the experience was.

00:14.033 --> 00:16.834
Which one did you tell first,
you goddamn liar,

00:16.834 --> 00:18.934
your girlfriend or wife?
They were here.

00:18.934 --> 00:20.734
They knew the story.
They were here?

00:22.334 --> 00:24.567
You have a department
physical coming up,

00:24.567 --> 00:27.167
a physical you are guaranteed
not to pass,

00:27.167 --> 00:29.100
and you want me
to get you off the hook,

00:29.100 --> 00:32.567
give you a clean bill
of health, lie to the F.D.N.Y.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.701
This is all
I know how to do, doc.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.067
I don't fish.
I don't golf.

00:37.067 --> 00:38.234
I fight fires.

00:38.234 --> 00:40.601
The only way
that I will have this kid

00:40.601 --> 00:42.267
is if you promise
to be a normal,

00:42.267 --> 00:43.801
close-to-home dad.

00:43.801 --> 00:47.801
I gotta say, honey,
you look gorgeous right now.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.267
I know.

00:52.334 --> 00:53.834
What are you
laughing at?

00:53.834 --> 00:55.801
You and Janet,
what's... What is this?

00:55.801 --> 00:59.667
You guys have the brotherhood,
so we have the motherhood.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.033
Will you marry me?

01:02.033 --> 01:04.667
Yes. Does that surprise you
or scare you?

01:04.667 --> 01:06.601
Heh. Fifty-fifty.

01:18.534 --> 01:19.667
Disgusting.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.367
What if she lost 250 pounds?

01:21.367 --> 01:22.734
- She's dead.
- I know.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.934
She can't lose weight,
because she's dead.

01:24.934 --> 01:26.767
- Still no fires?
- Nah, man.

01:26.767 --> 01:28.133
The last tour, caught what,

01:28.133 --> 01:30.734
four frozen water pipes,
a kitten stuck in a toilet,

01:30.734 --> 01:32.501
and a busted valve
in a subway stop.

01:32.501 --> 01:34.200
Three weeks.
Three goddamn weeks

01:34.200 --> 01:35.634
in the city without a fire.

01:35.634 --> 01:37.267
The last time
we had the ladder up

01:37.267 --> 01:38.901
was Garrity going up
to make sure

01:38.901 --> 01:42.367
the water bucket was full.
What water bucket?

01:45.567 --> 01:46.801
Oh, direct hit.

01:46.801 --> 01:48.834
Oh, man, that was a good one.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.400
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.701
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:52.701 --> 01:54.267
I feel bad for you, Mike.

01:54.267 --> 01:56.634
I mean, what is this,
the fifth time? This year.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.434
There's not a third one,
is there, guys?

02:00.434 --> 02:01.701
No. No third one.

02:01.701 --> 02:03.868
Your job is done here.
Thank you. Go dry off.

02:03.868 --> 02:06.200
Hey. Since when do you ask
my daughter to marry

02:06.200 --> 02:08.067
without asking
my permission first?

02:08.067 --> 02:10.234
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.
No. You hold on, okay?

02:10.234 --> 02:13.234
She went on a bender, jerk-off.
You pointing fingers at me?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.767
I'm pointing fingers at you...
She went on a bender

02:15.767 --> 02:18.000
because she got some
goofy-ass DNA from you.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.234
- Hey, Tom. Come on.
- Whoa, whoa.

02:20.234 --> 02:22.834
I don't have to ask you
permission for shit, old man.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.067
- What the hell is this?
- News crew.

02:25.067 --> 02:26.667
- What?
- A news crew.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.067
Hey, knock it off, you animals.

02:29.067 --> 02:32.567
It's almost time
for my close-up.

02:32.567 --> 02:33.901
What's going on?

02:33.901 --> 02:36.033
Hi. Pam Kepp.

02:36.033 --> 02:37.167
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

02:37.167 --> 02:38.300
This is the news chick.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.934
Excuse me. Reporter.
For what?

02:39.934 --> 02:42.100
This is the Jimmy thing.
What Jimmy thing?

02:42.100 --> 02:43.801
The piece they're doing
on Jimmy.

02:43.801 --> 02:45.167
Relax. This is a good thing.

02:45.167 --> 02:47.033
What do you mean
it's a good thing?

02:47.033 --> 02:48.200
What kind of good thing?

02:48.200 --> 02:50.234
Wait. All right,
let's go. Get out.

02:50.234 --> 02:51.300
Come on,
Tommy.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.634
Whoa, whoa!

02:52.634 --> 02:53.701
Hey, asshole!

02:53.701 --> 02:55.067
I'm the asshole?

02:55.067 --> 02:56.534
Let me tell you
something.

02:56.534 --> 02:58.400
See that guy,
the face up on the plaque

02:58.400 --> 03:01.234
that you got your cameras
and your other shit pointed at?

03:01.234 --> 03:03.200
That's my cousin, all right?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.501
My best friend.

03:04.501 --> 03:06.000
What do you think this is,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.167
the baseball hall of fame?
You waltz in here

03:08.167 --> 03:10.234
and start taking
pictures of plaques?

03:10.234 --> 03:14.000
He was a fireman,
not a goddamn first baseman!

03:14.000 --> 03:15.934
Anybody that does
anything about him,

03:15.934 --> 03:18.434
they gotta talk
to me first.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.434
And here's me talking.
Get out.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.067
Let's go.
We should shoot this.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.434
What'd you say, asshole?

03:23.434 --> 03:24.801
Hey, come on, Tommy.

03:24.801 --> 03:26.334
All right, that's enough!

03:26.334 --> 03:28.133
That's enough!
Let it go!

03:28.133 --> 03:30.434
- Come on!
- Get him outta here!

03:30.434 --> 03:32.501
- Christ, Tom.
- Tom, come on.

03:32.501 --> 03:33.934
Will you relax?

03:33.934 --> 03:36.534
You make a move, we're gonna
kick your ass to the curb.

03:36.534 --> 03:38.868
Who's idea was this?
It was cleared by HQ.

03:38.868 --> 03:40.601
They got official papers.

03:40.601 --> 03:41.868
Really? Signed by who?

03:41.868 --> 03:43.033
Sheila.
Bullshit.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.901
It's not bullshit,
we saw the papers.

03:44.901 --> 03:48.100
Tommy, they're doing a 9/11
10th-anniversary special thing.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.200
Really? What's their
angle, Franco?

03:50.200 --> 03:52.200
What, is it
the 9/11 conspiracy?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.367
Is that their angle?

03:53.367 --> 03:54.868
Maybe it's our crew didn't do

03:54.868 --> 03:56.934
the job they were supposed
to do that day.

03:56.934 --> 03:59.267
Maybe that's the angle.
Or it's the department

03:59.267 --> 04:00.634
they're gonna blame.
No.

04:00.634 --> 04:02.701
Maybe that I slept
with my cousin's wife.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.667
Is that what they're going for?
They picked out six guys

04:05.667 --> 04:07.501
who were there.
Jimmy's one of them.

04:07.501 --> 04:08.868
It's an hour-long special.

04:08.868 --> 04:10.634
Six random guys.
That's the story.

04:10.634 --> 04:12.467
It is a hero piece.

04:12.467 --> 04:14.367
In Jimmy's case,

04:14.367 --> 04:16.233
they're gonna talk
about Damian too.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.634
Family bloodlines,
the baby that he saved.

04:18.634 --> 04:19.901
Hero blood.

04:19.901 --> 04:21.233
Not booze-hound blood.

04:22.534 --> 04:23.634
Huh.

04:23.634 --> 04:25.467
I'm putting an end
to this right now.

04:25.467 --> 04:26.467
Where are you going?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.934
Call somebody to cover for me.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.767
What do you mean, cover for you?
It's kind of short notice.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.000
You got any suggestions?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.234
No. I mean, doesn't even
have to be a fireman.

04:34.234 --> 04:35.767
Leaky valves and frozen pipes?

04:35.767 --> 04:37.133
Get a goddamn plumber.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.300
Oh, sure.

04:39.834 --> 04:42.801
Like it's so easy
to find a goddamn plumber.

04:50.701 --> 04:54.067
<i>* On another day</i>
<i>C'mon, c'mon *</i>

04:54.067 --> 04:57.734

<i>Can we do no wrong? *</i>

04:57.734 --> 05:00.567

05:36.033 --> 05:37.801
All right.
I want some answers.

05:37.801 --> 05:39.868
What is going on with
this Jimmy TV thing?

05:39.868 --> 05:41.234
You're gonna wake the baby.

05:41.234 --> 05:43.100
You know what?
I'm gonna wake the dead

05:43.100 --> 05:44.467
if I don't get some answers.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.601
You know, I was...
Came from the firehouse.

05:46.601 --> 05:48.300
Your little new best friend
here...

05:48.300 --> 05:50.167
Yes, gave her permission
for the news

05:50.167 --> 05:51.434
to do a story about Jimmy.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.501
I most certainly did.

05:52.501 --> 05:54.801
It was my idea, actually.
What...

05:54.801 --> 05:56.634
They called, and they asked
about it,

05:56.634 --> 05:59.234
She called me. We discussed it.
She called them back

05:59.234 --> 06:01.534
and gave the go-ahead.
With no input from me?

06:01.534 --> 06:03.100
This has nothing to do with you.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.367
What?

06:04.367 --> 06:06.167
Could you pass
me the scrub sponge?

06:06.167 --> 06:08.567
Yes. I will trade you
the paper towels.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.133
Absolutely.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.501
Thank you.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.567
Forgot to tell you that
I love these 2-plies so much.

06:14.567 --> 06:15.567
I do too.

06:15.567 --> 06:18.434
Write that down.
Two-ply paper towels

06:18.434 --> 06:20.667
for when you go to the store.
You smell good.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.267
You smell good. The vanilla.
What are you wearing?

06:23.267 --> 06:24.968
You are not wearing that
vanilla.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.100
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

06:27.100 --> 06:28.367
All right,

06:28.367 --> 06:30.467
I have had enough

06:30.467 --> 06:34.534
of this best-friend
bullshit, okay?

06:34.534 --> 06:36.367
We're gonna lay a few laws down

06:36.367 --> 06:38.167
in this house right now.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.601
Okay? Uh.

06:39.601 --> 06:41.567
I'm the boss
around here, okay?

06:41.567 --> 06:43.400
I'm tired of being treated
like, uh,

06:43.400 --> 06:46.534
you know, I'm some kind of a...
A Mexican errand boy.

06:46.534 --> 06:47.801
Okay? Yeah. Right.

06:47.801 --> 06:50.868
Now we go shopping
when I say we go shopping, okay?

06:50.868 --> 06:53.467
And when it comes to Jimmy,
I got a lot of stuff to say.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.300
Okay? So from now on,

06:55.300 --> 06:57.300
strap yourselves in,
sisters, okay?

06:57.300 --> 07:01.934
Because it's gonna be a ride
that's driven by me, okay?

07:01.934 --> 07:03.434
What do you think
about that?

07:03.434 --> 07:06.467
Starting now. Right now!

07:11.467 --> 07:13.267
What?

07:14.567 --> 07:16.868
You are so insensitive.

07:16.868 --> 07:18.133
Hey, I am not...

07:18.133 --> 07:19.801
Oh, you're a caveman.

07:19.801 --> 07:21.033
I said it.

07:21.033 --> 07:23.200
You have no say
when it comes to Jimmy Keefe.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.634
No say!

07:24.634 --> 07:26.267
I mean,
he was my husband.

07:26.267 --> 07:27.400
He's still my husband.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.033
You don't own
his memory. I do.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.601
It is 10 years later,
and no one remembers his name.

07:32.601 --> 07:34.534
No. Half of this
country doesn't know

07:34.534 --> 07:36.167
how many firemen
died that day.

07:36.167 --> 07:38.801
And we don't have to worry
about your indiscretions,

07:38.801 --> 07:40.834
because we are in control
of this story.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.834
Of... Of my...

07:42.834 --> 07:45.267
What about your stuff?
You both did stuff.

07:45.267 --> 07:46.567
A lot...

07:46.567 --> 07:48.701
What's wrong with you?

07:48.701 --> 07:51.300
I'm fat!

07:51.300 --> 07:52.701
You... Okay, listen.

07:52.701 --> 07:55.033
You are... You're not fat.
All right?

07:55.033 --> 07:57.868
I'm huge!
Look at my thighs.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.000
You don't... Bare...

07:59.000 --> 08:01.067
You have extra calves
instead of thighs.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.467
What are you talking about?
My jeans do not fit.

08:03.467 --> 08:04.901
My ankles are bloated, okay?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.467
And I'm a blimp.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.634
No, you're not.
I'm such a blimp.

08:08.634 --> 08:11.501
Okay, okay,
you... You wanna de-blimp?

08:11.501 --> 08:12.501
Uh-huh.
Okay.

08:12.501 --> 08:13.801
Go sit next to your mother.

08:13.801 --> 08:16.534
That ought to put things
in perspective. Ha.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.300
Oh.

08:22.601 --> 08:24.567
No. Wait.
No, no, no, no.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.200
No. That did...
That didn't... No.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.534
No. See, I did...
Listen.

08:28.534 --> 08:29.968
Hey.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.601
I didn't...

08:31.601 --> 08:34.200
No, no, no.
I didn't say fat.

08:34.200 --> 08:38.133
She said fat. I said...
I said perspective.

08:41.366 --> 08:42.601
Oh, my God!

08:42.601 --> 08:45.100
I can't believe
you just called Mom a blimp.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.701
No, I never said, "mom,"

08:46.701 --> 08:48.767
and, "blimp,"
in the same sentence.

08:48.767 --> 08:49.801
I... I...

08:49.801 --> 08:51.667
You know...you know,

08:51.667 --> 08:53.901
Auntie Sheila's right,
okay?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.634
Uncle Jimmy, he deserves
to be on that TV show,

08:56.634 --> 08:59.000
and he's gonna be
on that TV show,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.601
because he was a hero,
and everybody's gonna watch,

09:01.601 --> 09:03.067
and everybody's gonna see it,

09:03.067 --> 09:06.667
and they're gonna see
what a hero he was.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.667
And mom's not fat!
She's pregnant!

09:09.667 --> 09:11.334
Okay.

09:11.334 --> 09:13.067
It's okay, honey.

09:14.434 --> 09:16.834
- You know what, sweetie?
- You are not fat.

09:16.834 --> 09:19.767
There's a list of stuff we need
from the store. We need it now.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.634
You are non-sized.

09:23.200 --> 09:27.133
This is,
"tampons, Motrin."

09:27.133 --> 09:30.000
Are you guys all, you know,
what do you call it?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.501
Doing the...
At the same time?

09:31.501 --> 09:33.267
Yeah. It's called
cycling, okay?

09:33.267 --> 09:36.133
Okay. Cycling.

09:38.801 --> 09:41.367
Now why don't you get
Lance Armstrong

09:41.367 --> 09:43.234
to go to the goddamn
pharmacy for you?

09:43.234 --> 09:45.434
Because I'll tell you
something right now.

09:45.434 --> 09:49.300
I'm not going.
I am not going to the...

09:49.300 --> 09:51.567
To the vagina aisle.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.567
Oh. Jeez.

10:32.567 --> 10:34.501
Ah.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.534
Can we help you, sir?

10:35.534 --> 10:37.067
Ah. No. I'm good. Good.

10:37.067 --> 10:38.701
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

10:38.701 --> 10:40.300
Just, uh... Good.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.534
You know this is the
feminine hygiene aisle?

10:42.534 --> 10:43.734
Yeah.

10:43.734 --> 10:45.400
It's not the men's
cologne section.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.801
Uh-huh.

10:46.801 --> 10:48.300
I have a list of stuff.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.200
Vagisil?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.868
Vagisil don't come in a spray can.
Yeah.

10:52.868 --> 10:55.234
Must be pervert week.
All right, man. Let's go.

10:55.234 --> 10:57.434
Th-that's okay.
I know him. He's married.

10:57.434 --> 10:59.601
He has a couple daughters.

10:59.601 --> 11:01.901
Let me see.

11:01.901 --> 11:02.901
You know her?

11:02.901 --> 11:04.868
Umm, yeah.

11:04.868 --> 11:07.167
You know what? And this
writing's way too neat

11:07.167 --> 11:08.334
to be a guy's writing.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.501
I'm sure they sent him
down here to get this.

11:10.501 --> 11:12.267
This messy part's
probably yours.

11:12.267 --> 11:14.934
What does that say? "T-tand."
Hand lotion.

11:14.934 --> 11:17.968
I have very dry hands.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.434
I can vouch for him.

11:20.434 --> 11:22.667
The hand lotion's
in aisle five.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.367
Show's over folks.

11:24.367 --> 11:26.400
Move along.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.901
Thank you.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.634
Kelly,
what are you doing here?

11:30.634 --> 11:32.601
Buying shampoo.

11:32.601 --> 11:34.367
"Tampax Pearl,
Always With Wings,

11:34.367 --> 11:35.834
Kotex Lightdays." Holy shit.

11:35.834 --> 11:38.367
Are all the girls in your
house on the same cycle?

11:38.367 --> 11:39.501
Oh, yeah. Major cycle.

11:39.501 --> 11:41.300
It's kind of like
the tour de pants.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.968
Heh.
I can help you get this.

11:42.968 --> 11:44.834
Oh. Well, thanks.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.067
What's, uh...
What's going on?

11:47.067 --> 11:50.367
Um, I got cancer.

11:50.367 --> 11:52.267
I moved into an apartment
over here

11:52.267 --> 11:56.300
because it's closer to where
my medical torture takes place.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.601
This says two tubes
of Preparation H?

11:58.601 --> 12:01.000
Yeah. One's for my wife,
and the other one's for,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.367
uh, Sheila's under-eye...

12:03.367 --> 12:04.434
You remember Sheila.

12:04.434 --> 12:06.300
Yes. Joe Pesci
with tits.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.634
Yeah.
Okay.

12:07.634 --> 12:09.767
"Carefree Pantiliners
for thongs."

12:09.767 --> 12:12.133
Who's pregnant?
My wife.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.734
Four months and...

12:13.734 --> 12:15.601
And you're still seeing
the tit bull?

12:15.601 --> 12:18.300
No, no, no, no, no.
They're actually

12:18.300 --> 12:19.667
kind of seeing
each other.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.167
They both went lesbo?

12:21.167 --> 12:22.667
No. I wish.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.267
They're, uh, like, best friends,
believe it or not.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.234
So your wife
is four months pregnant,

12:27.234 --> 12:29.701
and she's best friends
with your ex-mistress?

12:29.701 --> 12:31.167
Yeah.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.234
I think you're gonna need more
than one bottle of hand lotion.

12:34.234 --> 12:36.634
You should check, see
if they sell it by the case.

12:36.634 --> 12:37.701
Hmm.

12:37.701 --> 12:39.868
Here. You need this
for your eyes?

12:39.868 --> 12:42.100
Yes. Thank you. Ow.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.501
Oh.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.667
Man, that stuff stings.

12:45.734 --> 12:47.901
Yeah.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.834
So, uh, cancer.

12:50.834 --> 12:52.400
Is it, uh...
Is it serious?

12:53.734 --> 12:54.734
It's cancer.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.901
Right. Of course. Yeah.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.400
What... What is...
Breast.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.868
I'm down one.

13:01.868 --> 13:02.934
One?

13:02.934 --> 13:06.601
Breast.
Ah. Right.

13:06.601 --> 13:07.968
But you're...
You're okay?

13:07.968 --> 13:10.200
Oh, yeah.
Every day is a party.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.033
Guess which one.
Hmm?

13:13.033 --> 13:15.501
Can you guess
which one's fake?

13:15.501 --> 13:17.400
You...
You want me to...

13:21.100 --> 13:22.434
That one?

13:22.434 --> 13:23.601
Wrong.

13:23.601 --> 13:25.601
Looks like you're buying
the coffee.

13:25.601 --> 13:29.701
And I think that we should
get you some chocolate.

13:29.701 --> 13:31.067
Choc... Why?

13:38.434 --> 13:41.033
- Hey, Lou, where you at?
- Come on, man.

13:41.033 --> 13:43.334
Everybody's on the rig.
Let's go. Where is he?

13:43.334 --> 13:46.033
Here. Come on. Hear everybody
yelling? We're waiting.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.567
I ain't going.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.267
What?
I ain't going.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.534
You ain't going? You taking
a mutual or something?

13:51.534 --> 13:53.100
No.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.501
So you're not going now.
You're not going later.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.367
What? You know some way around
taking the annual physical?

13:58.367 --> 14:00.367
Clue us in. Nobody
wants to go downtown.

14:00.367 --> 14:02.400
Why don't you guys go
and leave me alone.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.167
If you don't take the medical,
they'll pull you off duty.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.100
If I take the medical,
they'll pull me.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.067
You wanna tell us
what's going on?

14:09.067 --> 14:12.801
I got some health issues,
all right?

14:12.801 --> 14:13.968
It's not a big thing.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.868
All right, but it's
enough of a thing

14:15.868 --> 14:18.801
that if the doctors find out,
you'll be out the door, right?

14:18.801 --> 14:21.667
Exactly how serious is this? I
feel like I got a right to ask,

14:21.667 --> 14:23.501
considering you keel over
in a fire,

14:23.501 --> 14:26.100
my ass is probably gonna burn up
trying to save yours.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.601
I got some heart problems.

14:27.601 --> 14:28.767
Well, yeah, no shit.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.968
We broke you out
of the hospital, remember?

14:30.968 --> 14:32.734
I know. Since then.
Jesus.

14:32.734 --> 14:34.667
The doctor says it's gonna
be all right,

14:34.667 --> 14:36.033
if I start exercising,

14:36.033 --> 14:38.667
you know, get in shape.
All of which you ain't doing.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.501
Well, I'm starting soon.
You didn't start soon enough.

14:41.501 --> 14:44.200
Which brings us to today,
with you sitting on this couch

14:44.200 --> 14:45.868
while everybody else is waiting.

14:45.868 --> 14:47.000
Ugh, I mean, look, Lou,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.400
I got a lot of respect for you.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.267
Half of what I know
as a firefighter...

14:50.267 --> 14:51.868
Shit, 75 percent
of what I know,

14:51.868 --> 14:53.534
I learned from you.
But come on.

14:53.534 --> 14:56.400
You gotta get
your shit together.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.667
What am I gonna do?

14:58.834 --> 15:01.133
Well, it's Lou, right?
We gotta do something.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.367
Yeah. Look, come on, man.

15:02.367 --> 15:03.601
Just get on the rig, okay?

15:03.601 --> 15:05.534
We'll figure something
out on the way.

15:05.534 --> 15:07.701
What are we gonna figure out?
I don't know.

15:07.701 --> 15:09.767
How take a complete
head-to-toe physical

15:09.767 --> 15:13.234
without actually taking it.

15:13.234 --> 15:15.167
We got Twinkies
on the rig.

15:19.133 --> 15:21.133
You boys got all your paperwork

15:21.133 --> 15:22.300
filled out, ready to go?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.400
Yeah. Good to go.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.601
Locked and loaded.

15:24.601 --> 15:27.367
I'm gonna hit the head downstairs.
All right.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.133
I'm going to get a coffee,

15:29.133 --> 15:30.801
but I will leave
you with this:

15:30.801 --> 15:32.734
When the doctor
checks your prostate,

15:32.734 --> 15:34.033
it will not be the last time

15:34.033 --> 15:36.367
the F.D.N.Y. gives
it to you in the ass.

15:36.367 --> 15:37.400
Godspeed.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.968
Don't clench.

15:38.968 --> 15:40.701
Thanks.

15:40.701 --> 15:42.200
This shit is never gonna work.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.801
How we gonna get away
with this?

15:43.801 --> 15:45.667
I'm the first one
to admit it's crazy.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.367
You never even been
through this.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.234
It's ten, twelve
different doctors.

15:49.234 --> 15:51.434
Gonna be fine. Million guys
go through here.

15:51.434 --> 15:52.567
They might not notice.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.133
If they do,
it's our asses.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.734
Everything's gonna go well.
We'll cross that bridge

15:56.734 --> 15:58.567
if we come to it.
Hey, 62 Truck.

15:58.567 --> 15:59.667
Just a minute!

15:59.667 --> 16:01.434
Remember who
you're supposed to be

16:01.434 --> 16:02.567
and in what room, okay?

16:02.567 --> 16:04.868
All right, 62 Truck, on three.
One, two, three.

16:04.868 --> 16:06.100
Sixty-two Truck.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.100
Shawn, you're up first.
Lou, let's go.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.334
What?
To the bathroom.

16:09.334 --> 16:11.033
What for?
So you can blow me.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.200
To swap shirts. Come on.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.734
The plan.
Yes.

16:13.734 --> 16:16.634
Yes. Yes.

16:16.634 --> 16:18.434
Was he sleeping over there?

16:23.767 --> 16:26.334
You're doing very
well, Lieutenant Shea.

16:26.334 --> 16:29.133
Yeah. Thanks.
Piece of cake.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.100
One twenty-five
over eighty.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.267
That's a major improvement
over last year,

16:41.267 --> 16:42.400
Lieutenant, uh, Shea.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.801
Yep. That's me,
Lieutenant Shea.

16:45.801 --> 16:48.701
Lieutenant Kenneth Shea.

16:48.701 --> 16:50.400
Uh, you know,
they call me Lou,

16:50.400 --> 16:52.868
because
Lou-ten-ant is,

16:52.868 --> 16:56.334
you know... The Lou goes for...
The Lou in the tenant.

16:56.334 --> 16:58.501
So, yeah, says so right here
on this shirt.

16:59.634 --> 17:01.300
Lieutenant Shea.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.734
My shirt.

17:05.534 --> 17:08.834
Okay. Ahem.
Here we go.

17:17.701 --> 17:20.400
I don't know if I can do this
with you staring at me, doc.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.767
I'm a medical professional,
Lieutenant Shea.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.166
I do this every day.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.901
I don't, I'm a little stage
fright.

17:25.901 --> 17:28.000
I get pee shy. Do you mind
turning around?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.434
We're required to observe.

17:29.434 --> 17:30.834
It's not like I can see your...

17:30.834 --> 17:32.234
I'm gonna stand here all day

17:32.234 --> 17:34.400
with my dick in my hand.
I can do that at home.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.400
I do do that at home.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.801
No, I don't really.
Fine.

17:36.801 --> 17:38.501
Okay, thanks, doc.

17:38.501 --> 17:40.434
Here we go. Okay. Unh.
Niagara Falls.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.501
Niagara Falls.

17:43.501 --> 17:45.901
Hudson River, ugh.

17:45.901 --> 17:48.400
Pouring rain.
Tidal waves.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.534
Water fountains.

17:49.534 --> 17:51.234
Anything?
No.

17:51.234 --> 17:52.234
Nothing. Shit.

17:52.234 --> 17:53.934
Could you turn
the sink on, maybe?

17:53.934 --> 17:56.501
That... The running
water might help, you know?

17:56.501 --> 17:57.501
Thanks, doc.

17:58.501 --> 17:59.567
Okay. Oh, yeah.

17:59.567 --> 18:01.300
Much better. Okay.
Come on, baby.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.901
Work your magic.
There she goes. Huh?

18:03.901 --> 18:05.434
Yeah.

18:05.434 --> 18:06.701
All right.

18:06.701 --> 18:07.934
Uh-oh.

18:07.934 --> 18:09.734
Uh, ooh,
can you turn that off?

18:09.734 --> 18:11.100
Please turn it off. Uh, ooh.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.100
I'm gonna need another cup.
Say again?

18:13.100 --> 18:14.934
I'm filling this one up pretty
quick.

18:14.934 --> 18:16.367
Pinch it off.
I'm trying.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.200
Kegels. Kegels.
Uh... Kegels.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.634
Thank you. Okay.
You got it?

18:20.634 --> 18:24.501
Oh, man. God.
I'm gonna fill this one up too.

18:24.501 --> 18:26.834
Shit. Shouldn't have
had all that coffee.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.067
Can I get another cup?
Thanks. Thanks, doc.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.501
Okay, here you go. Ready?
Making the transfer.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.367
Okay. Phew.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.667
Yeah. Boy, I'm gonna need
another cup. Ha, ha.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.167
I... I'm all out of cups!
Yeah.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.234
I need another cup,

18:38.234 --> 18:40.100
or I'm gonna piss
all over your floor.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.300
Could you hurry up?

18:41.300 --> 18:44.501
Oh, come on, you monkey.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.234
That's, uh...

18:56.234 --> 18:57.300
Oh, Jesus.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.000
Son of a bitch.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.934
Got them.
Oh, shit!

19:06.501 --> 19:08.267
I don't know what to say.

19:08.267 --> 19:10.400
Something funny.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.868
I'm so tired
of concerned looks

19:12.868 --> 19:14.100
and sympathetic smiles.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.167
Funny. Funny shit,
that's what I want.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.267
Okay.

19:18.267 --> 19:19.734
Um...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.234
I've always had a thing
for Bruce Willis.

19:24.234 --> 19:25.701
Yeah.

19:25.701 --> 19:28.033
That's what
I'm talking about.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.367
I've never been compared
to a male action hero before.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.501
Except I did see
this one guy

19:33.501 --> 19:35.234
that nicknamed me
Jackie Chan,

19:35.234 --> 19:38.801
but that was because
of this thing I did and it...

19:38.801 --> 19:40.801
Never mind.
I took it as a compliment.

19:40.801 --> 19:42.934
Yeah, I got a weird
compliment from my wife

19:42.934 --> 19:45.434
and my ex-girlfriend
the other day.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.701
Said I had girl legs.

19:47.701 --> 19:50.234
Oh, yeah.
Girl legs.

19:50.234 --> 19:52.467
And girl hair
and girl ass.

19:52.467 --> 19:55.834
I wonder what you'd look like
in some of my dresses.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.334
One more operation,

19:57.334 --> 19:59.033
we'll both have
the same bra size.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.400
Is that what they're saying

20:00.400 --> 20:02.167
that you're gonna...
They're gonna

20:02.167 --> 20:03.501
take the other one?
No,

20:03.501 --> 20:05.667
but you gotta be ready
for anything, right?

20:05.667 --> 20:09.868
And I have to say that this
whole thing has really...

20:09.868 --> 20:13.334
I don't know...
made me focus on the real,

20:13.334 --> 20:15.634
actual, tangible,

20:15.634 --> 20:19.100
important things in life.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.667
Like?

20:21.667 --> 20:23.467
Tits.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.400
No. I don't know.
I don't know.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.133
This shrink's roaming
the hallway of the cancer ward,

20:29.133 --> 20:31.901
wants to talk about
my feelings and my family

20:31.901 --> 20:35.634
and my bullshit.
I don't know, my legacy.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.634
They wanna know what I want
my legacy to be.

20:40.367 --> 20:41.501
And?

20:43.133 --> 20:44.467
Well, I don't know.

20:44.467 --> 20:46.434
What's your legacy?

20:48.534 --> 20:51.000
Uh...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.767
My kids, I guess.

20:52.767 --> 20:55.634
And unless I, uh,
got killed

20:55.634 --> 20:57.801
in the line of duty
and then that would be my,

20:57.801 --> 21:00.133
you know...

21:00.133 --> 21:02.234
You know, you get a plaque.

21:02.234 --> 21:03.234
Where's the plague?

21:03.234 --> 21:04.868
In the firehouse.

21:04.868 --> 21:08.000
Is there something for all
the guys that died in 9/11?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.467
Yeah. I mean, each firehouse,
we have stuff up, you know,

21:11.467 --> 21:13.567
for my cousin
and the other guys, but, um,

21:13.567 --> 21:15.701
next to Ground Zero,
there's a firehouse.

21:15.701 --> 21:18.868
Outside they have a really
impressive, uh, wall

21:18.868 --> 21:21.934
that they put up
with all 343 names.

21:21.934 --> 21:24.067
It's, you know...

21:24.067 --> 21:25.334
And are there pictures?

21:25.334 --> 21:26.901
No, no. Just the names.

21:26.901 --> 21:29.133
Well, that just doesn't...

21:29.133 --> 21:31.133
I don't know,
seem like enough, does it?

21:31.133 --> 21:32.734
Don't you think, for the public,

21:32.734 --> 21:35.000
there should be a picture
to go with the name?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.534
A face? Wouldn't you want there

21:36.534 --> 21:38.534
to be a picture
of your cousin somewhere

21:38.534 --> 21:40.767
so everybody could know
what he looked like?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.467
Yeah. Yeah.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.501
That'd be...
Yeah.

21:43.501 --> 21:45.534
Maybe that's what
I should do.

21:45.534 --> 21:49.100
What, put pictures
of my cousin? What?

21:49.100 --> 21:51.334
No, for me. I mean,
there's gotta be a picture

21:51.334 --> 21:52.667
of my tit somewhere.

21:52.667 --> 21:55.200
I think Billy Squier took a
picture of my tits once.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.534
Or maybe it was Billy Ocean.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.067
Which one's the black guy?

22:00.067 --> 22:03.267
Billy Ocean
was the black guy.

22:03.267 --> 22:05.100
I smoked a lot of weed
in the '80s too.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.667
It was really hard to remember.
Thank God.

22:07.667 --> 22:10.033
Or maybe I could get
a plaster cast made of my tit

22:10.033 --> 22:12.634
and turn it into
a paperweight or tea cup.

22:12.634 --> 22:15.901
Well, now,
I'd buy a couple of those.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.901
Ugh,
for old times' sake?

22:17.901 --> 22:20.100
Yeah, and also to, uh,

22:20.100 --> 22:21.100
to put in my dress,

22:21.100 --> 22:23.067
fill it out, you know. Heh.

22:23.067 --> 22:25.734
Couple of those things,
one of your dresses,

22:25.734 --> 22:27.801
and, uh, the space I got
between my teeth,

22:27.801 --> 22:29.467
I think I could give, uh,

22:29.467 --> 22:32.033
Lauren Hutton
a run for her money.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.434
Okay, pay up.
I have chemo in a half hour.

22:36.434 --> 22:38.567
Oh, yeah. Okay.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.634
Hurry up. You gotta get
your blood drawn.

22:40.634 --> 22:42.567
I can't do that
without my shirt.

22:42.567 --> 22:43.767
All right.

22:43.767 --> 22:45.767
Meet you back here.
Come on. Take it off.

22:45.767 --> 22:48.167
- All right, give me yours.
- If we get caught,

22:48.167 --> 22:49.567
the shit is gonna hit the fan.

22:49.567 --> 22:52.634
- Nobody's gonna know.
- Come on, give it to me.

22:52.634 --> 22:54.400
God, it's tight.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.968
Yeah.

22:58.934 --> 23:00.868
You want me to drop you
at the hospital?

23:00.868 --> 23:02.501
No. It's only
a couple of blocks.

23:02.501 --> 23:04.567
I like the air.
Gives me time to get ready.

23:04.567 --> 23:07.100
Besides, there's a cute
doctor working on my case

23:07.100 --> 23:08.701
that I kind of have
the hots for,

23:08.701 --> 23:11.667
and I don't want him
to think I have a boyfriend.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.467
What?
I just think that's great

23:13.467 --> 23:15.868
that you still have a,
you know, sex drive.

23:15.868 --> 23:19.934
Well, it's more like
a curiosity drive, really.

23:19.934 --> 23:21.767
You know, if I can get
a guy to like me

23:21.767 --> 23:24.200
based on
just my personality,

23:24.200 --> 23:25.701
what I say,
how I say it,

23:25.701 --> 23:27.767
no hair,
half the recommended cleavage.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.367
Maybe that's your,
uh, legacy.

23:31.367 --> 23:33.801
Heh, maybe.

23:33.801 --> 23:35.968
This was fun.
You should call me, same cell.

23:35.968 --> 23:37.501
Okay. Later?

23:37.501 --> 23:43.367
No. Later, I'll be gray
and dizzy and angry.

23:43.367 --> 23:46.067
Kind of reminds me
of when I was drinking.

23:46.067 --> 23:47.868
You quit?
Yeah. Had to.

23:47.868 --> 23:50.234
I, um... I got a call
from the Jameson's people.

23:50.234 --> 23:53.334
They wanted to give me a, uh,
lifetime achievement award.

23:53.334 --> 23:56.701
Took that as a bad sign,
so...

23:56.701 --> 24:00.033
See, that would look
great on you.

24:00.033 --> 24:01.601
Nah.

24:01.601 --> 24:02.968
It's the wrong cut.

24:02.968 --> 24:04.934
Makes me look
too hippy.

24:06.534 --> 24:08.367
Well, you better get
that stuff home

24:08.367 --> 24:10.601
before it turns into
<i>Night of the Living Dead</i>

24:10.601 --> 24:12.267
at your place.
Yeah. All right.

24:12.267 --> 24:15.133
See you later. Bye.
Bye.

24:21.033 --> 24:23.067
Yo, I got
the lung test next.

24:23.067 --> 24:24.334
Who am I? Me or Lou?

24:24.334 --> 24:26.634
Uh, hold on for a second.
Lung test. Lung test.

24:26.634 --> 24:28.000
Lung test, you're you.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.234
I'm Lou for the lung test.

24:29.234 --> 24:30.734
Weight test,
you're Lou.

24:30.734 --> 24:32.100
Lung test, me.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.367
Weight, Lou.
Yeah.

24:33.367 --> 24:35.734
Lung, me. Weight, Lou.
Lung, me. Weight, Lou.

24:35.734 --> 24:36.734
Lung, me.
Yeah.

24:36.734 --> 24:37.868
Son of a bitch...

24:37.868 --> 24:39.868
I hope you appreciate
what we're doing.

24:39.868 --> 24:42.234
Talk about taking a bullet.
I just got 16 shots.

24:42.234 --> 24:43.534
Hepatitis B, give me that.

24:43.534 --> 24:45.701
I got a tetanus shot.
I even got the TB test.

24:45.701 --> 24:46.734
You douche bag.
Ow!

24:46.734 --> 24:47.968
You weren't supposed to.

24:47.968 --> 24:49.801
He was supposed
to get his own shots.

24:49.801 --> 24:51.801
We decided that's
one thing he could do.

24:51.801 --> 24:53.167
Shit!
Yeah, double shit.

24:53.167 --> 24:54.300
You gotta go back later

24:54.300 --> 24:56.300
and get those shots
again for yourself.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.334
What?
Like I said

24:57.334 --> 24:58.434
when I broke it down,

24:58.434 --> 25:00.501
if you cover part
of the physical for Lou,

25:00.501 --> 25:02.868
you gotta go back
do them again for yourself.

25:02.868 --> 25:05.267
Otherwise, your physical
comes up incomplete.

25:05.267 --> 25:06.501
I got an idea.
What?

25:06.501 --> 25:08.133
If I'm getting
all of Lou's shots

25:08.133 --> 25:09.501
and Lou gets all of my shots,

25:09.501 --> 25:10.968
it should turn out all right.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.067
You know what I'm saying?
Lou. Hey, Lou.

25:13.067 --> 25:14.467
Where the hell
did he go?

25:14.467 --> 25:15.767
Goddamn it.

25:15.767 --> 25:18.234
Hey, can you, uh, die
from getting too many shots?

25:18.234 --> 25:20.400
I don't know.
I guess we're gonna find out.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.901
Sick of needles!

25:27.901 --> 25:29.067
How's it going, Frank?

25:29.067 --> 25:31.167
Chief. Uh, all good.

25:31.167 --> 25:33.634
So I heard. You see Feinberg?
No. No, No.

25:33.634 --> 25:36.400
But I been in and out with the
white coats, so, you know...

25:36.400 --> 25:39.267
I can't find him, and I checked
every shitter in this place.

25:39.267 --> 25:40.734
Oh. Ahem.

25:40.734 --> 25:42.701
I checked every shitter
in this place.

25:42.701 --> 25:44.267
Shit.

25:44.267 --> 25:46.000
Something you wanna tell me?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.334
Concerning?

25:47.334 --> 25:50.334
You, Lou?

25:50.334 --> 25:53.434
Um, well, you know, chief,
all due respect,

25:53.434 --> 25:54.734
if I answer that question,

25:54.734 --> 25:56.667
you're not gonna like
what you hear.

25:56.667 --> 25:59.534
So this is like a "Don't ask,
don't tell" situation?

25:59.534 --> 26:00.534
Exactly.

26:00.534 --> 26:03.033
Oh, my God.
What?

26:04.601 --> 26:06.634
Oh, Jesus Christ.

26:07.634 --> 26:08.767
Oh, shit.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.601
What's wrong now?
I knew something

26:10.601 --> 26:13.200
was gonna get screwed up.
Lou is supposed to be taking

26:13.200 --> 26:14.634
his own mental evaluation.

26:14.634 --> 26:16.167
Okay.
Ugh.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.434
Well, who's doing it?

26:18.434 --> 26:20.300
I mean, when I say
I masturbate a lot,

26:20.300 --> 26:22.234
I mean, you know,
one person's "a lot"

26:22.234 --> 26:25.467
can be, uh, another person's
"not so much," right?

26:25.467 --> 26:28.467
And I think
there have been times

26:28.467 --> 26:30.234
when I haven't, like,
masturbated

26:30.234 --> 26:31.534
for, like, a full day.

26:31.534 --> 26:33.033
Or two days, even.

26:33.033 --> 26:35.200
But like they say,
it's good for you, right?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.434
Good for your pro-state?

26:36.434 --> 26:38.133
Prostate.
Yeah, all that stuff.

26:38.133 --> 26:39.400
Are we done yet?

26:39.400 --> 26:42.100
Just a few more questions.
Oh, I'm not a lieutenant.

26:44.501 --> 26:46.200
I mean, yes,
I am a lieutenant.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.234
Why would you say you weren't
a lieutenant, Lieutenant Shea?

26:51.968 --> 26:53.000
Shame?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.734
Why do I smell urine?

27:00.267 --> 27:01.567
Nervous.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.801
Hey, wandering Jew,
what the hell are you doing?

27:12.801 --> 27:14.934
What the hell are you doing
locking me out?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.334
I didn't lock you out.

27:16.334 --> 27:17.734
Oh, come on, you little shit.

27:17.734 --> 27:19.501
Turn my back on you
for two seconds,

27:19.501 --> 27:21.300
and you're conspiring
against me.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.501
Open the goddamn door!

27:22.501 --> 27:24.534
This isn't
the medical building.

27:24.534 --> 27:26.767
The medical building's
two blocks that way.

27:26.767 --> 27:29.934
No. I just...
I just came out of here.

27:29.934 --> 27:32.033
You went to go to
the bathroom an hour ago.

27:32.033 --> 27:34.100
No one's seen you since.
What is going on?

27:34.100 --> 27:35.868
Why are we standing here,
talking?

27:35.868 --> 27:37.467
I don't wanna talk about this.

27:37.467 --> 27:38.701
Come on. Let's go.

27:38.701 --> 27:41.968
Sidney. It's this way.

27:43.701 --> 27:45.701
Asshole.

27:50.067 --> 27:51.701
Okay, girls.

27:51.701 --> 27:53.934
Where the hell have you been?

27:53.934 --> 27:55.767
What'd you do?
Crawl there and back?

27:55.767 --> 27:57.367
Nah, I...
Why do you smell like

27:57.367 --> 28:00.133
feminine hygiene spray?
Yeah. Tropical breeze.

28:00.133 --> 28:02.868
Oh, it was... I...
This was an emergency.

28:02.868 --> 28:04.534
What part did you not
understand?

28:04.534 --> 28:05.667
I, you know...

28:05.667 --> 28:07.734
it's like we have to spell
everything out.

28:07.734 --> 28:09.634
Ooh, dear God.
Girls, chocolate.

28:09.634 --> 28:10.801
He got chocolate.
Aah!

28:10.801 --> 28:12.667
He got chocolate.
You got chocolate.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.000
And it's from France!

28:14.000 --> 28:15.801
Yes.
Oh, ha, ha.

28:15.801 --> 28:17.400
Dad, you smell good.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.868
Thank you, honey.
And you know what, girls?

28:19.868 --> 28:21.734
I was thinking,
uh, while I was making

28:21.734 --> 28:24.901
my little trip, um,
about the whole Jimmy TV thing,

28:24.901 --> 28:26.133
and you know what? I...

28:26.133 --> 28:28.300
I rethought it,
and I think it's a good idea.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.300
I think it would be great
for his legacy.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.934
I think it's a no-brainer,
and, uh, I'm in.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.534
Why is...? Why is that so funny?

28:39.534 --> 28:41.200
Oh, honey, that's sweet.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.667
He's in.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.868
He's so in.

28:44.868 --> 28:47.200
Yeah, your interview's
next week.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.434
What?
Mm.

28:49.434 --> 28:53.601
Me, Lou, Needles and Franco,
we're doing ours this week,

28:53.601 --> 28:55.067
then you are doing
yours last

28:55.067 --> 28:57.767
so that we can make sure
that you talk and act good.

28:57.767 --> 29:00.567
Whoa. This is what you guys
were discussing

29:00.567 --> 29:02.934
while I was gone?
Oh, my God.

29:02.934 --> 29:04.100
I think I just swallowed

29:04.100 --> 29:05.601
some crystallized lavender.

29:05.601 --> 29:06.767
Mm-hm?
Mm-hm.

29:06.767 --> 29:08.767
- Crystallized lavender?
- Mm.

29:08.767 --> 29:11.067
Oh, it is heavenly delicious.
Okay.

29:11.067 --> 29:12.300
No, listen.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.033
While you were gone,
ahem,

29:14.033 --> 29:17.434
we were crying, cleaning
and cursing your very existence.

29:17.434 --> 29:19.701
The interviews,
we set up last week.

29:19.701 --> 29:24.567
Well, you can just unset it,
because I'm not doing it. Okay?

29:24.567 --> 29:26.501
Number one,
because you didn't ask me,

29:26.501 --> 29:29.200
number two, because if you
had asked me, I'd have said,

29:29.200 --> 29:31.667
"I'll do the interview.
When hell freezes over."

29:31.667 --> 29:34.734
Okay? You just call back whoever
it is you have to call back

29:34.734 --> 29:40.901
and you tell them
Tommy Gavin is not...

29:49.801 --> 29:51.267
What should I wear?

29:57.400 --> 30:01.434
So looking through your results
for all of your tests today,

30:01.434 --> 30:03.701
your blood pressure's great.

30:03.701 --> 30:06.734
Uh, your weight is down
very nicely from last year.

30:06.734 --> 30:08.934
It's, uh, 165.

30:10.234 --> 30:13.300
Yeah. I, uh...
I don't carry it well.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.501
A little in here.

30:14.501 --> 30:18.434
good,
stress test: very good,

30:18.434 --> 30:20.234
uh, lung capacity's
excellent.

30:20.234 --> 30:22.701
Well, pays to take care
of yourself, I always say.

30:23.701 --> 30:25.200
All right, look, blood,

30:25.200 --> 30:27.868
hearing,
vision's all good.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.767
The only red flag
seems to be

30:29.767 --> 30:32.200
from your mental
wellness evaluation,

30:32.200 --> 30:36.334
and, uh, the psychiatrist
strongly recommended

30:36.334 --> 30:42.067
that you seek counseling
for your issues involving

30:42.067 --> 30:44.567
excessive masturbation,

30:44.567 --> 30:49.234
uh, occasional incontinence,
and your latent homosexuality.

30:51.834 --> 30:54.801
All right.
Um, I'll get right on that.

30:54.801 --> 30:56.601
And, hey,
I wanted to say you guys

30:56.601 --> 30:58.567
just do a great job
down here.

30:58.567 --> 31:00.133
I was dreading coming down here

31:00.133 --> 31:04.234
for this physical, but this year
was easiest it's ever been.

31:04.234 --> 31:07.567
Well, just one more thing.

31:07.567 --> 31:09.968
And I spoke too soon.

31:19.767 --> 31:21.000
Hi.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.901
What are you doing here?

31:22.901 --> 31:24.901
Uh, Franco said
you sometimes come here.

31:26.067 --> 31:27.367
How many you had?

31:27.367 --> 31:28.834
Ugh. Four.

31:28.834 --> 31:30.534
Doing the trick?

31:30.534 --> 31:32.834
It's club soda, Colleen,
all right?

31:32.834 --> 31:35.033
Unlike some people,
I have dignity.

31:35.033 --> 31:36.801
I don't need
that hard shit like you

31:36.801 --> 31:38.434
and your old man
drink so much of.

31:38.434 --> 31:40.100
Drank so much of.
Oh.

31:40.100 --> 31:43.200
Of course. Here comes the "thing
of the past" speech, right?

31:43.200 --> 31:47.133
Got drunk because you were
nervous, simple and clean.

31:47.133 --> 31:49.267
You're just gonna blow
it all away, right?

31:49.267 --> 31:52.000
So you wanna come up here
and give me my ring back

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
so, you know, because
you just couldn't handle it all.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.300
It was too much for you.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.701
So get on with the show
so I can get on with my life.

31:58.701 --> 31:59.801
Shawn,

31:59.801 --> 32:01.734
another club soda
for the gentleman.

32:01.734 --> 32:03.367
Thanks.

32:04.901 --> 32:06.501
I think she likes you.

32:06.501 --> 32:08.734
Not as much
as she dislikes you.

32:08.734 --> 32:13.534
You know, brother sharing
same space with a white girl.

32:13.534 --> 32:15.000
Up in here,

32:15.000 --> 32:18.033
you know, we're not exactly
a popular pair, all right?

32:18.033 --> 32:19.501
Especially
with the sisters.

32:21.567 --> 32:25.167
Well, then they're gonna hate
my white Irish ass for this.

32:30.567 --> 32:31.834
What are you doing?

32:31.834 --> 32:35.267
Shawn Johnston,
I want you to marry me.

32:35.267 --> 32:36.801
Let's take this outside.

32:36.801 --> 32:39.934
I know you don't think
I can handle it, but I can.

32:39.934 --> 32:41.167
I'll be ready.
Shh. Ha.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.267
She's just so silly.

32:42.267 --> 32:44.667
I mean, yeah, been doing
a little drinking.

32:44.667 --> 32:46.767
She's got a bit of
a drinking problem.

32:46.767 --> 32:49.067
Hey, no. I am
in the program, okay?

32:49.067 --> 32:50.167
I just had a little slip.

32:50.167 --> 32:51.501
I hear that, sister.

32:51.501 --> 32:54.200
What makes you think the lily
white bitch can't hack it?

32:54.200 --> 32:55.801
Whoa. Slow your roll, all right?

32:55.801 --> 32:57.968
She's not a bitch.
No, I'm the bitch

32:57.968 --> 33:00.133
that's gonna slap that
weave off your head.

33:00.133 --> 33:01.968
You want some?
Because this is real.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.901
Hey! Hey!

33:04.901 --> 33:06.567
No, I saw you
looking at my man.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.701
That is a weave!

33:07.701 --> 33:11.567
Shawn! Shawn!

33:11.567 --> 33:13.000
Calm down!
God.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.601
Calm down,
all right? Chill!

33:15.601 --> 33:17.300
Who was she,
Mo'Nique on crack?

33:17.300 --> 33:18.667
This is Harlem, baby.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.934
You don't see me walking
into Paddy McFadden's

33:20.934 --> 33:23.934
down in Hell's Kitchen sticking
my tongue down your throat.

33:23.934 --> 33:25.667
Know your surroundings, Colleen.

33:25.667 --> 33:29.868
And you gotta corral
that anger, man.

33:29.868 --> 33:32.701
Trying to take on a bar
full of pissed off sisters?

33:32.701 --> 33:33.868
What are you thinking?

33:33.868 --> 33:35.701
Yeah, I'm not scared
of them, Shawn.

33:35.701 --> 33:37.234
That's what I'm talking about.

33:37.234 --> 33:39.567
No. And I'm not scared
of marrying you either.

33:39.567 --> 33:41.901
If you just hang in with me,
I know I can do this.

33:41.901 --> 33:43.868
I want to do this.

33:43.868 --> 33:46.467
I'm not gonna say yes
just because you...

33:46.467 --> 33:48.868
Because you want me to,
all right?

33:51.033 --> 33:52.801
You're scary, baby.

33:52.801 --> 33:56.167
But not as scary as the prospect
of being married to a drunk.

33:59.501 --> 34:01.334
I need some time
to think about this.

34:01.334 --> 34:02.868
Okay.

34:02.868 --> 34:04.267
Okay, so take some time.

34:05.968 --> 34:08.333
I'm not going anywhere.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.734
Good. But if you do,

34:16.734 --> 34:18.333
make sure you
don't go anywhere

34:18.333 --> 34:19.701
above 110th Street.

34:19.701 --> 34:22.367
Sisters are looking
to cut you deep.

34:22.367 --> 34:25.100
I'm shitting my pants.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.667
Hey, I love you.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.900
I must be out of
my goddamn mind.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.467
Uh, Lou, you really think

34:44.467 --> 34:47.367
that's the best idea after
everything we just did for you?

34:47.367 --> 34:49.467
What? It's a Power Bar.

34:49.467 --> 34:51.300
It's a Snickers.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.367
You have your power,
I have mine.

34:54.833 --> 34:55.868
Hey, man.

34:55.868 --> 34:57.132
We need to talk, Tommy.

34:57.132 --> 34:59.334
Okay, that's our cue.

34:59.334 --> 35:00.501
Sit down!

35:00.501 --> 35:02.634
Wait a minute,
is this like a family thing?

35:02.634 --> 35:05.534
It is. As much as you assholes
wanna deny it,

35:05.534 --> 35:07.667
you're all in the goddamn
family. Sit down.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.934
Shit. Great.

35:09.934 --> 35:11.534
Not only can we
not catch a fire,

35:11.534 --> 35:13.767
now we're all part
of the de facto Gavin clan.

35:13.767 --> 35:16.400
Lucky us.

35:17.667 --> 35:19.234
Colleen proposed to me.

35:19.234 --> 35:20.601
What?

35:20.601 --> 35:21.701
She asked you?

35:21.701 --> 35:23.567
Yeah.
That's right.

35:23.567 --> 35:25.868
She got down
on one knee,

35:25.868 --> 35:28.234
showed me a ring,
and she proposed.

35:28.234 --> 35:29.968
Sounds a little backwards.

35:29.968 --> 35:32.534
Yeah, well, in the Gavin family
station wagon,

35:32.534 --> 35:33.868
reverse is drive.

35:33.868 --> 35:34.934
That's a good point.

35:34.934 --> 35:36.934
The women have
the balls in that family.

35:36.934 --> 35:38.701
Didn't Maggie propose
to Garrity?

35:38.701 --> 35:40.467
She did. Thanks
for bringing it up.

35:40.467 --> 35:42.400
Want lemon juice
to pour in that wound?

35:42.400 --> 35:43.667
How'd that work out?

35:43.667 --> 35:45.367
It was the best
8 months of my life.

35:45.367 --> 35:47.601
I left with a rosy outlook
on relationships,

35:47.601 --> 35:49.667
not to mention nightmares
and the scars,

35:49.667 --> 35:51.033
You gotta get a girlfriend.

35:51.033 --> 35:52.667
Well, clearly
he can't rope one.

35:52.667 --> 35:55.200
You know, maybe he needs a cat.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.501
Okay, you know what, guys?

35:56.501 --> 35:57.801
Why don't we all shut up

35:57.801 --> 36:00.100
and let the kid
finish what he had to say.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.267
Let me guess.

36:02.267 --> 36:04.067
You said yes,
and you came down here

36:04.067 --> 36:05.767
to give me the finger
and gloat.

36:05.767 --> 36:07.234
No.

36:07.234 --> 36:09.200
I came to ask
for your blessing.

36:11.167 --> 36:12.868
Now you want my blessing.

36:14.234 --> 36:15.667
Listen, Tom,
I respect you,

36:15.667 --> 36:16.934
and it wasn't right for me

36:16.934 --> 36:18.634
not to ask you
for Colleen's hand.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.901
I was just so worried
and caught up

36:20.901 --> 36:22.868
not knowing
what she was gonna say,

36:22.868 --> 36:25.200
and it didn't cross my mind
how you would feel.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.067
And I haven't given her
my answer just yet.

36:29.267 --> 36:30.934
In light of
all of your knowledge

36:30.934 --> 36:34.167
and wisdom and experience
in the matter of marriage,

36:34.167 --> 36:37.467
I came to ask if you think
I should marry your daughter.

36:37.467 --> 36:41.567
And whatever you decide,
Tom,

36:41.567 --> 36:43.934
I'm gonna respect
that decision.

36:47.434 --> 36:49.033
Really?

36:51.367 --> 36:54.801
So whatever I say
is what goes.

37:00.534 --> 37:02.434
That's very classy.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.868
And I say...

37:11.667 --> 37:12.701
No.

37:12.701 --> 37:15.200
Aw. Oh, man.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.701
No.

37:18.701 --> 37:19.801
- Wow.
- Aw.

37:19.801 --> 37:20.801
That's cold, Tom.

37:20.801 --> 37:23.467
Thanks for asking.

37:29.267 --> 37:32.167
Yeah, Colleen, it's me.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.067
Yes. I will marry you.

37:35.067 --> 37:37.601
Oh, shit. Aww. What?

37:41.167 --> 37:46.467
I respect you, now it's time
for you to respect me.

37:48.601 --> 37:49.834
Okay, Dad?

37:53.901 --> 37:55.467
Wait a minute. Is that it?

37:55.467 --> 37:58.167
If that's how it begins,
I can't wait to see how it ends.

37:59.801 --> 38:01.601
Goddamn it.

38:03.434 --> 38:04.534
Let's go.

38:04.534 --> 38:07.734
<i>Ladder.</i>

38:07.734 --> 38:09.834
<i>Battalion.</i>

38:19.434 --> 38:21.868
Button up your coats, boys.
We got a live one!

38:21.868 --> 38:23.567
Yeah!
Whoo!

38:23.567 --> 38:26.534
Might be a big mother too.
Could go four alarms.

38:26.534 --> 38:27.734
Is anybody inside?

38:27.734 --> 38:30.701
We got three adjoined tenements.
Fully stocked!

38:30.701 --> 38:32.400
Yeah.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.534
That's what I'm talking about.
It's like Christmas all over.

38:47.901 --> 38:53.934
<i>* I got the world</i>
<i>On a string *</i>

38:53.934 --> 38:56.534
<i>* Sitting on a rainbow... *</i>

38:56.534 --> 39:00.434
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:00.434 --> 39:02.667
Let's go. Move them over.

39:05.033 --> 39:06.734
<i>* What a world *</i>

39:06.734 --> 39:10.300
<i>* What a life</i>
<i>I'm in love... *</i>

39:10.300 --> 39:11.400
Step aside.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.400
Let the master do it.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.067
Old school. Unh.

39:15.067 --> 39:17.033
Check out across the hall.

39:17.033 --> 39:20.801
<i>* Anytime I move my finger *</i>

39:20.801 --> 39:22.567
<i>* Lucky me *</i>

39:22.567 --> 39:26.467
<i>* Can't you see I'm in love *</i>

39:26.467 --> 39:30.434
<i>* Life is a beautiful thing *</i>

39:30.434 --> 39:34.234
<i>* As long as I hold a string *</i>

39:34.234 --> 39:38.234
<i>* I'd be a silly so and so *</i>

39:38.234 --> 39:40.734
<i>* I should ever let it go *</i>

39:43.167 --> 39:45.934
<i>* I got the world on a string *</i>

39:45.934 --> 39:48.501
<i>* Sitting on a rainbow *</i>

39:48.501 --> 39:52.067
<i>* Got the string</i>
<i>Around my finger *</i>

39:52.067 --> 39:54.868
<i>* What a world</i>
<i>What a life *</i>

39:54.868 --> 39:57.701
<i>* I'm in love *</i>

40:01.534 --> 40:05.534
<i>* Life is a beautiful thing *</i>

40:05.534 --> 40:09.334
<i>* As long as I hold a string *</i>

40:09.334 --> 40:13.300
<i>* I'd be a silly so and so *</i>

40:13.300 --> 40:17.934
<i>* If I should ever let it go *</i>

40:17.934 --> 40:19.767
<i>* I got the world on a string *</i>

40:19.767 --> 40:21.200
All right, fellas,
come on.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.901
We're taking up and
heading back.

40:22.901 --> 40:24.534
Chief, come on.
We just got here.

40:24.534 --> 40:26.300
The fire's been over
for two hours.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.534
You gonna overhaul the whole
neighborhood?

40:28.534 --> 40:29.734
You two, get down here.

40:29.734 --> 40:31.667
Come on.
We're just getting started.

40:31.667 --> 40:34.300
Fill your tanks, clean
your tools when we get home.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.300
Dispatch has just
assigned us to a block

40:36.300 --> 40:38.834
down on 128th and Lennox.
Sounds like another job.

40:38.834 --> 40:40.467
You got about
20 cell calls on it.

40:40.467 --> 40:42.133
Ah, that sounds
like a hot one.

40:42.133 --> 40:43.934
Whoo!
Let's go, ladies!

40:43.934 --> 40:45.968
We got more work to do.

40:45.968 --> 40:48.267
Finally. Come on.
