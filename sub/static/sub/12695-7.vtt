WEBVTT

00:07.775 --> 00:08.976
- Ha! Ha! Got ya, hippo!

00:09.077 --> 00:10.978
Right in your stuffed
chubby butt.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.350
- Oh, you're so sweet, Max.

00:16.450 --> 00:20.020
- Whenever I see a fat hippo,
I'll think of you.

00:20.121 --> 00:23.224
Let's seal this moment
with a selfie.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.659
- [cellphone camera clicks]

00:25.759 --> 00:28.096
- Oh, our eyes came
out all red.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.430
We totally look evil.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.499
- I know.
It's a keeper!

00:36.804 --> 00:38.972
- [huge whoosh of air]

00:39.073 --> 00:40.308
- Sorry, everyone.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.176
Must have been some extra
wind in the tubes.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.246
In the biz, that's called
a "tube fart."

00:45.346 --> 00:47.281
You know what?
sploagies on the house!

00:47.381 --> 00:48.849
- [menu buttons beeping]

00:48.949 --> 00:51.685
- [sploagies thudding]

00:51.785 --> 00:54.021
- Free food!

00:54.122 --> 00:57.425
- Oh, no, Max, the bracelet
you gave me fell off.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.093
Uh, maybe it's underneath
the table.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.363
- Yeah.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.031
- Oh, do you see it?

01:04.132 --> 01:06.033
Achoo! Achoo!

01:06.134 --> 01:07.435
- [groans]

01:07.535 --> 01:09.403
- Sorry. I'm allergic
to fur.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.038
- Hope it's not
my mustache.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.174
I forgot to shave.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.842
- [table thuds]

01:14.942 --> 01:17.378
- Oopsa-doopsie.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.148
Tatiana not see so good with
inside sunglasses.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.715
- Keep it moving, furball.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.884
My girl is allergic to
your weird hat.

01:23.984 --> 01:27.388
- Sorry, Tatiana not mean to
spoil big-time American date.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.526
- I feel so bad about
the bracelet.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.262
- Hey, don't
worry about it.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.164
We'll check by
the Fun Claw--

01:36.230 --> 01:37.865
right after I finish
this sploagie.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.301
- I guess we shouldn't let
anything ruin our--

01:40.401 --> 01:41.835
Ahhh!

01:41.935 --> 01:47.175
- What? Do I have
something on my face?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.942
- You've just got...
a little...

01:49.042 --> 01:50.644
Ahhh!

01:56.517 --> 02:00.488
- I'm blue. Ahhhhh!

02:03.090 --> 02:04.258
Ahhhhhh!

02:04.358 --> 02:06.460
- *

02:06.560 --> 02:07.995
* What you see

02:08.095 --> 02:09.430
* Is not what you get

02:09.530 --> 02:12.600
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:12.700 --> 02:14.335
* We fit right in

02:14.435 --> 02:15.803
* Bet you never guessed

02:15.903 --> 02:17.338
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:17.438 --> 02:19.207
* Just like all the rest

02:19.240 --> 02:20.674
* A picture
perfect family *

02:20.774 --> 02:22.776
* Is what we try to be

02:22.876 --> 02:24.212
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:24.278 --> 02:25.779
* The crazy things we do

02:25.879 --> 02:27.481
* This isn't
make believe *

02:27.581 --> 02:29.250
* It's our reality

02:29.350 --> 02:30.718
* Just your average family

02:30.818 --> 02:33.754
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:33.854 --> 02:37.658
* Livin' a double life

02:42.095 --> 02:43.897
- Hey, did you guys
all receive--

02:43.997 --> 02:46.033
- A text from Max saying
there was a family emergency?

02:46.133 --> 02:47.034
We all got one.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.537
- Awww, his text says
that he's blue.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.672
My baby must have
had a bad date.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.807
Everyone be nice to him.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.109
- [footsteps pounding]

02:56.244 --> 02:58.346
- ALL: [laughing]

02:58.446 --> 03:01.114
- It's not funny!
Stop laughing!

03:01.249 --> 03:04.518
You're probably wondering why
I gathered you all here.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.854
- So we could take pictures?

03:06.954 --> 03:09.690
- [cellphone cameras clicking]
- No pictures!

03:09.790 --> 03:12.793
You're here become
someone in this room

03:12.893 --> 03:15.963
slipped me a Bolivian
blue bean.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.332
It turns your skin blue
for 24 hours.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.402
- So you're gonna look like
Little Boy Blue all day?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.070
- ALL: [laughing]

03:23.170 --> 03:25.873
- Silence!

03:25.973 --> 03:29.810
I was keeping these beans in
my lair to turn Phoebe--

03:29.910 --> 03:32.713
It's not important
why I had them.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.283
Nobody leaves until
I find out who did this.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.717
- Come on, Max.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.151
You're not gonna turn
this tiny little prank

03:38.286 --> 03:40.354
into some big
investigation, are you?

03:40.454 --> 03:41.689
- Big? No.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.591
Huge? Yes!

03:43.691 --> 03:47.027
- [whiteboard rattling]

03:48.996 --> 03:51.765
- Each of you had
a reason to turn me

03:51.865 --> 03:55.303
into this oddly-handsome
blue devil.

03:55.369 --> 03:59.773
- Impressive work and may I say
I'm honored to be a suspect.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.876
- This pathetic rabbit
here reminds me

04:02.976 --> 04:05.846
who my first suspect is--

04:05.946 --> 04:07.515
Thunderman!

04:07.615 --> 04:09.617
- ALL: [gasping]

04:12.786 --> 04:14.922
- He has a history
of getting payback

04:15.022 --> 04:16.957
against the villains
who wronged him.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.461
- Not to brag,
but yes I am amazing at it.

04:20.561 --> 04:21.962
[laughing]

04:22.062 --> 04:23.464
- And slipping a blue bean
into my sploagie

04:23.564 --> 04:26.667
would be the perfect payback
for what I did to you.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.038
- Oh, sploagie,
I told everyone

04:31.138 --> 04:32.340
I'd never see you again,

04:32.373 --> 04:35.776
but you are sloppy
Heaven-on-a-roll.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.978
- [sauce splooshing]

04:39.246 --> 04:42.683
- Mom, Dad's eating
another sploagie!

04:42.783 --> 04:44.485
- I'd better
take this to go.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.454
Thunderman, away!

04:46.554 --> 04:47.855
- [loud thud]
- Ah!

04:47.955 --> 04:49.590
- [loud thud]
- [groans]

04:49.690 --> 04:53.126
- I reinforced the ceiling
with thundertanium as a prank.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.397
Also, Mom's not home.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.835
- Hank, you asked me to help
you quit sploagies

05:01.935 --> 05:03.937
'cause they were stainin'
all your shirts.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.107
- Well, you're not doin'
a very good job, Barb.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.976
- How are you even
getting sploagies?

05:09.076 --> 05:11.211
I gave Splatburger a picture
of you that said,

05:11.379 --> 05:14.047
"Do not feed this man."

05:14.147 --> 05:17.685
- Hey, Mom, this
is my investigation

05:17.785 --> 05:20.120
and the next suspect
is you!

05:20.220 --> 05:22.155
- [dramatic music]

05:22.255 --> 05:25.459
- Okay, where is that sound
even coming from?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.428
- It's an app.

05:27.528 --> 05:32.800
Now, Mom, you know you've
been out to get me ever since...

05:32.900 --> 05:35.135
"The Incident."

05:36.904 --> 05:38.406
Mom, Maddy. Maddy, Mom.
- Hey.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.474
- Oh, I love your bracelet,
Mrs. Thunderman.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.975
It's so vintage.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.977
- Oh, thanks, it was
my great-grandmother's.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.514
- Go ahead, try it on.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.050
- It looks beautiful
on you.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.120
- Which is why we want
you to have it.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.156
- For real?
- For real?

05:56.256 --> 05:59.760
- Yeah, it's a gift
from us.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.862
- What are you doing, Max?
- I like this girl.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.165
Come on, don't be "that" mom.
- Don't be "that" mom?

06:05.265 --> 06:07.200
You know very well
I am "that" mom.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.169
Now I want you to get
that bracelet--

06:09.269 --> 06:11.004
- Okay, Maddy,
we've gotta go.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.674
Bye, Mom.
- Thanks, Mrs. Thunderman.

06:13.774 --> 06:14.942
- You're welcome--

06:15.042 --> 06:16.844
girl I don't even know!

06:16.944 --> 06:18.546
- [door slams]

06:20.648 --> 06:23.617
So, for that, Mom--
if that is your real name.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.219
- So, I'm not happy you gave
my great-grandmother's bracelet

06:26.319 --> 06:30.290
to a girl you met at
a phone accessory kiosk.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.093
But your father and I
didn't turn you blue.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.463
- You're right,
you two are too lame

06:35.496 --> 06:37.865
to commit such
a fiendish crime.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.967
[powers zapping]

06:40.067 --> 06:42.369
But you know who isn't?

06:42.470 --> 06:46.239
Wait for it.
Phone's stuck in my pocket.

06:46.339 --> 06:50.310
Nora!
- [dramatic music]

06:50.478 --> 06:52.913
- You mean l'il old me?

06:53.013 --> 06:55.048
- Can the cute, sweetheart.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.651
You know why you
were out to get me.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.055
- Hey, Dr. Colosso,

07:02.155 --> 07:03.891
have you seen
my new yellow bow?

07:03.991 --> 07:07.060
- Yes, next to that bucket.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.196
- But this is brown.

07:09.296 --> 07:13.934
- That's because Max used it
to clean my cage.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.837
I made some serious boomsie.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.372
- Ahhhhhhhh!

07:19.507 --> 07:22.576
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about that.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.077
Ahhhhhhhh!

07:24.177 --> 07:25.979
[powers zapping]
- Ow!

07:26.079 --> 07:27.915
That hurts!

07:28.015 --> 07:29.850
But what hurts even more...

07:29.950 --> 07:32.520
is that my own brother
could have done this to me--

07:32.620 --> 07:36.524
Billy!
- [horn a-ooga'ing]

07:36.590 --> 07:38.692
- I'm done with these
stupid sound effects.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.928
- Do you have to be
so dramatic?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.429
- I'm the one who looks like

07:42.530 --> 07:44.598
a teenaged Cookie
Monster, so, yes!

07:44.698 --> 07:48.201
[chomping]

07:48.301 --> 07:49.603
- Why would I do
this to you?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.605
- Revenge!

07:54.141 --> 07:56.209
- The tunnel to Candytown!

07:56.309 --> 08:00.113
Max, you were right!
It does exist!

08:00.213 --> 08:02.382
Candy!
- [loud thud]

08:04.952 --> 08:06.587
[loud thud]

08:06.687 --> 08:11.559
- I tried that tunnel
three more times.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.160
- Max, all you've
proven here

08:13.260 --> 08:15.028
is that you're
a serious jerk.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.331
And we don't need a board full
of yarn to tell us that.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.901
- Says the girl who has
the greatest reason

08:21.001 --> 08:23.236
of all to turn me blue.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.405
- That's it? Where's
my dramatic flair?

08:25.573 --> 08:27.107
- I wasn't done yet.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.076
Dramatic flair!

08:29.176 --> 08:32.479
- Oh, ha, ha. Thanks.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.447
- You know you wanted
to get me back

08:34.582 --> 08:38.085
ever since our fight
earlier.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.924
- Yes! Ha! Ha!
* I'm here first

08:44.024 --> 08:45.959
- Hey, you two know
you're not allowed

08:46.059 --> 08:47.460
in here at the same time.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.729
I'm tired of
your food fights.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.632
Splatburger
is a classy joint.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.705
This place used to
be a shoe store.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.142
- Come on, Max, I'm meeting
all of my friends here.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.844
Just leave.
- Yeah, right.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.113
I'm here with Maddy.
You need to get gone.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.849
- Fine. There's only
one way to settle this.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.317
- BOTH: Rock, paper,
scissors...

09:10.417 --> 09:14.021
- Telekinesis.
- [gasping]

09:14.121 --> 09:16.624
- [loud thud]

09:18.626 --> 09:20.861
- Hey, Sherlock,
here's a mystery.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.362
If I wasn't allowed
in Splatburger,

09:22.462 --> 09:23.997
how could I have
turned you blue?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.734
- Obviously, you...

09:26.834 --> 09:29.069
you know what you did!

09:29.169 --> 09:30.470
- Whadda you got in here?

09:30.638 --> 09:31.805
- Colosso, get out
of my bag!

09:31.905 --> 09:34.642
- MAX: I'll take that.
[powers zapping]

09:36.910 --> 09:39.212
- How'd that get in there?

09:39.312 --> 09:43.550
- You were the weird
Russian girl at Splatburger,

09:43.651 --> 09:46.153
weren't you, Tatiana?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.858
- Oopsa-doopsie.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.464
- Okay, I admit I was
at Splatburger

09:57.564 --> 09:59.066
but I didn't
turn Max blue.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.635
- Stop stuffing your guilty
mouth with jellybeans

10:01.735 --> 10:04.437
and admit what you did.

10:04.537 --> 10:08.608
- Yeah, dressing up in silly
outfits is far from normal.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.578
I say, burn the witch!

10:11.679 --> 10:14.014
- Okay, the only reason
I was wearing a disguise

10:14.114 --> 10:15.248
was so that
the manager, J.J.,

10:15.348 --> 10:17.384
wouldn't see me and Max
there at the same time.

10:17.484 --> 10:20.220
Also, I look awesome
in furry hats.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.621
- Why should
I believe you?

10:21.722 --> 10:24.257
- Um, I have a reason.

10:24.357 --> 10:29.029
- A big blue reason.

10:29.129 --> 10:33.200
- W-Why's everyone
staring at me?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.904
I'm blue? I'm blue!

10:37.004 --> 10:38.772
Ha, told you
I didn't do it.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.208
Who looks like
an idiot now?

10:41.308 --> 10:44.745
- You don't really want
us to answer that.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.579
- The criminal must have
taken another blue bean

10:46.680 --> 10:49.216
from my jar and slipped
it into your jellybeans.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.419
- Whoever's doing this
better knock it off.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.653
It was funny
when it was Max.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.690
But not our Phoebe.
[whimpering]

10:56.790 --> 10:58.558
- All right, it's obvious
the criminal

10:58.658 --> 11:00.360
is either Billy or Nora.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.262
- They're also witches!

11:04.898 --> 11:06.767
- Or Colosso.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.068
- Okay, we should get
the jar of blue beans

11:08.168 --> 11:10.637
and see if there are
any fingerprints on it.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.572
- In the future, whisper
your ideas to me

11:12.740 --> 11:14.742
and I'll say them
out loud.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.777
We are going to
get the jar

11:16.877 --> 11:20.848
and see if there are
fingerprints on it.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.951
- How do you get
fingerprints off of a jar?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.919
- I think we need
to question Billy.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.021
- Billy, we need
to question you.

11:28.121 --> 11:33.827
- Do we really need this light
in my face, Avatar?

11:33.927 --> 11:37.097
- Yes, 'cause that's what
they do on TV.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.667
- I didn't turn you
guys blue, I swear.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.269
- Now you're swearing?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.604
Tsk, you used to be such
a sweet little boy, Billy.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.907
- I only had your jar
because I needed

11:47.007 --> 11:49.542
a new home for
my spider, Prudence.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.379
- Then where is this
imaginary spider?

11:52.479 --> 11:53.680
- I moved her--

11:53.781 --> 11:56.049
into your retainer case.

11:56.149 --> 12:00.921
I'll show you.
[zooming]

12:01.021 --> 12:02.622
[zooming]
See?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.591
She laid egg sacs
on your retainer.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.059
See? See?

12:06.159 --> 12:10.030
- It's your retainer
now, Billy.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.132
- That's it--the wind
that blew the napkin

12:12.232 --> 12:14.802
at Splatburger
wasn't a tube fart.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.438
It was a Billy fart!
- PHOEBE: [gasps]

12:18.538 --> 12:19.807
- Okay, I was there.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.376
And farting is part of
super speed travel.

12:23.476 --> 12:27.080
But I didn't put that
bean in your food.

12:27.180 --> 12:31.251
I...just went to play
the Fun Claw.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.987
- I was having fun,
too, Billy,

12:34.087 --> 12:37.724
'til you ruined my big-time
American date.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.961
Look how much fun
me and Maddy were having.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.930
- Wait, Max, look at that.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.331
- What? My hair
or my dimples?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.199
I was so cute a couple
of hours ago.

12:46.299 --> 12:49.502
- No, look in
the background.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.671
- [gasps] Nora's bow!

12:51.839 --> 12:53.706
She was at
Splatburger, too!

12:53.841 --> 12:55.208
- We're outside.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.244
Why are you shining
a light on me?

12:57.344 --> 13:00.680
- We're askin' the questions
here, short stack.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.316
- Yeah, explain the bow
in this picture.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.119
- I've never seen
that bow in my life.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.856
- You're wearing it
right now.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.390
Spill it, Nora!

13:10.490 --> 13:16.063
- Speaking of spills,
what's this?

13:16.163 --> 13:20.868
That's sploagie sauce
from Splatburger!

13:20.968 --> 13:23.370
- Fine!
I was at Splatburger.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.339
But I wasn't there to get
revenge on Max.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.641
I...wanted to play
the Fun Claw

13:28.741 --> 13:31.912
and win it all
for Baby Lulu.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.114
- You wanted to win
a doll for a doll?

13:34.214 --> 13:37.150
Do we look stupid?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.987
Gotta stop asking that.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.889
- Your story doesn't
make sense, Nora.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.324
- Either does your face.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.628
- So, we've gathered you
all back here again

13:48.728 --> 13:51.965
because we finally figured out
who the criminal is.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.801
- Mom, Dad...

13:54.902 --> 13:57.137
Please tell us which one
of them did it!

13:57.237 --> 14:01.241
- Billy, Nora, is it true that
one of you is Bluey the Kid?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.177
[laughing] That's what
we're calling the criminal.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.314
- We also came up with
The Great Bluedini.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.917
[laughing]
We had a lot of fun.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.651
- Are we done here
or are you two

14:11.751 --> 14:15.288
gonna keep accusing us
until you're blue in the face?

14:15.388 --> 14:18.725
- Nailed it!
- [palm slap]

14:18.825 --> 14:21.194
- I think Phoebe did it.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.064
Then she turned herself blue to
throw you off her trail.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.967
* Dun Dun Dah

14:27.067 --> 14:28.468
- That's ridiculous.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.403
If anyone's a suspect,
it's the former supervillain

14:30.503 --> 14:33.941
who poops in
Max's pillowcase.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.175
- I'm sorry.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.609
Would you like to
build me an elevator

14:36.709 --> 14:39.312
that goes to the toilet?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.348
- Colosso's right, Phoebe.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.383
Ever since you've
turned blue,

14:43.483 --> 14:46.086
you've been sneakin' around
whispering things in my ear.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.821
- You asked me to do that!

14:48.956 --> 14:50.991
You know, I'm done
helping you.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.325
- Yeah, that's right,

14:52.425 --> 14:55.128
disappear like
the Great Bluedini.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.165
- Oh, our name
is catchin' on, honey.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.967
- WOMAN ANNOUNCING:
Alert! Alert!

15:00.033 --> 15:02.002
Maddy approaching.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.270
- Maddy?

15:03.370 --> 15:07.107
I guess I'm irresistible
even as a angry Smurf.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.675
- COLOSSO: I can't wait.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.211
I'm gonna finally get
to meet her.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.246
- [doorbell rings]
- From under this hat.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.115
- [motor humming]

15:15.215 --> 15:16.984
- [lamp clicks]

15:19.052 --> 15:20.653
- Hi, Mrs. Thunderman.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.524
I am so sorry, but I somehow
lost the bracelet you gave me.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.226
- Oh, don't worry
about it, Maddy.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.862
It's...just jewelry.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.798
- And Max--Oh!

15:31.898 --> 15:33.400
You're still blue.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.368
Sorry for running
out on you.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.070
- Listen, don't worry.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.371
This whole blue thing
only lasts a day.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.273
And it's not contagious.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.510
- Then how do you
explain her?

15:43.610 --> 15:48.281
- And now a cheerleader
from school saw me.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.483
- Achoo! Achoo!

15:50.583 --> 15:54.054
Oh, no, maybe I'm allergic
to you, Max.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.622
Achoo!
- No, no, no, it's not me.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.190
It's my sister's
stupid hat again.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.426
That's what's making you
sneeze like a wet cat.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.895
- [door slams]
- [sighs] Shoot.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.369
- That's it! Phoebe's hat!

16:09.469 --> 16:11.804
I know who
the criminal is.

16:11.904 --> 16:16.443
And it's one of you four!
- ALL: [gasping]

16:16.543 --> 16:18.445
- [powers zapping]
- [thunder crashing]

16:18.545 --> 16:23.450
- Sorry--sometimes I thunder
clap when I get startled.

16:23.550 --> 16:27.620
- Don't apologize.
It added to the moment.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.861
- *

16:34.961 --> 16:36.363
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

16:36.463 --> 16:38.265
Sorry, Thundermans,
we're closed.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.068
Ugh! Besides, shouldn't you
two be at a hospital?

16:41.134 --> 16:44.371
- [blowing frosty air]

16:44.471 --> 16:47.440
Oopsa-doopsie.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.777
- Now, I brought you all back
to the scene of the crime

16:50.877 --> 16:54.247
to reveal which one of you
is Bluey the Kid.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.816
- Yes!
- BOTH: [palm slap]

16:56.916 --> 16:59.986
- First, there's Billy.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.421
It was just after
he ran in

17:01.521 --> 17:03.990
that Maddy noticed
her bracelet was missing.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.492
Coincidence?

17:05.592 --> 17:07.794
Or was he sent here
to steal it back...

17:07.894 --> 17:10.663
for Mom?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.099
Sorry.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.533
For Mom?
- Oh!

17:13.633 --> 17:15.435
All right, you caught me.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.404
But this belonged to
my great-grandma.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.239
You had no right
to give it to Maddy.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.773
- Exactly!

17:20.873 --> 17:22.809
So, when you told Maddy
it was "just jewelry,"

17:22.909 --> 17:25.512
I knew something
was up your sleeve.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.381
Just didn't know
which one.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.950
- Well, what about Nora?
We know she was here, too.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.120
- Yes, Nora.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.421
So cute.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.124
So guilty...

17:37.157 --> 17:40.560
of coming to Splatburger
to get sploagies for Dad!

17:40.660 --> 17:44.164
- ALL: [gasping]
- Of course!

17:44.264 --> 17:45.865
The sauce on Nora's stroller

17:45.965 --> 17:49.469
matches the stain
on Dad's shirt.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.271
- That's because Nora's
been carrying

17:51.371 --> 17:53.873
more than Baby Lulu
in this thing.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.442
Dramatic blanket yank!

17:55.542 --> 17:58.178
- ALL: [gasping]

17:58.278 --> 17:59.979
- They're on to us, Dad.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.014
Make a run for it!

18:02.149 --> 18:03.383
- It's okay, Nora.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.917
Everyone knows
I've been using

18:05.017 --> 18:08.221
my little girl
to smuggle take-out.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.357
- And I used Billy
to steal jewelry.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.159
We're bad parents.

18:12.192 --> 18:15.228
- True, but we're great
at naming things.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.530
- We are.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.733
- Now, let's talk
about Phoebe.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.271
I thought she was too
goody-goody to pull this off.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.506
Also, too annoying,
too boring--

18:26.606 --> 18:28.708
- Okay, hurry up.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.377
- It was both
here and at home

18:30.477 --> 18:31.778
Maddy has sneezing fits

18:31.878 --> 18:33.813
from being allergic
to Phoebe's fur hat.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.682
- But it's made
of fake fur.

18:35.782 --> 18:39.486
- I already knew
that, Blues Clues.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.489
At home, I saw
the fake fur label

18:42.589 --> 18:44.824
and realized it was
something else

18:44.924 --> 18:46.326
that was making
Maddy sneeze.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.796
- Booger fairies!

18:49.896 --> 18:51.898
- No.

18:51.998 --> 18:55.335
It was the person
who turned me blue.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.337
And they're hiding
in the one place

18:57.437 --> 19:00.640
no one would notice
a furry criminal.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.642
The Fun Claw!

19:02.742 --> 19:07.514
- ALL: [gasping]
Dr. Colosso?

19:07.614 --> 19:11.651
- Oh, hi, guys.
You eat here, too?

19:11.751 --> 19:15.255
- Dr. Colosso, you've
been caught red-handed.

19:15.355 --> 19:20.227
Footed! Pawed! Whatever you
walked on, you're guilty.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.061
- You can't prove it.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.397
- Oh, but he can.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.299
You can prove it,
right, Max?

19:26.399 --> 19:28.435
- Yes.

19:28.535 --> 19:33.640
With the help of
a dramatic flashback.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.709
There I was, with Maddy,
being charming, as always.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.010
- You're so sweet, Max.

19:38.110 --> 19:42.114
- Whenever I see a fat hippo,
I'll think of you.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.684
Let's seal this moment
with a selfie.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.885
As we snapped our selfie,

19:45.985 --> 19:48.455
Nora, the sploagie
smuggler, entered.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.756
- [cellphone camera clicks]

19:49.856 --> 19:52.425
- But that wasn't the only
thing she was smuggling.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.760
Nora didn't know it,

19:53.860 --> 19:56.263
but Dr. Colosso hitched
a free ride in her stroller.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.731
Once inside, Colosso
need a distraction.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.667
Lucky for him, Billy
spinned the town.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.370
- BILLY:
[zooming]

20:05.472 --> 20:06.806
- J.J.: Sploagies
on the house.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.008
- [menu buttons beeping]
- [sploagies thudding]

20:09.108 --> 20:10.377
- Free food!

20:10.477 --> 20:13.546
- Oh, no, Max, the bracelet
you gave me fell off.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.047
Uh, maybe it's underneath
the table.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.317
- MAX: We went under the table
to look for the bracelet.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.420
- MADDY: Achoo! Achoo!

20:20.520 --> 20:23.022
- MAX: That's when
Colosso appeared.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.491
- [laughing]

20:24.591 --> 20:25.725
- MAX: It was his
fur that caused

20:25.825 --> 20:28.094
Maddy's snot-filled
sneezing attack.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.497
- Achoo! Sorry.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.898
I'm allergic to fur.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.232
- MAX: Colosso then
seized the moment

20:33.333 --> 20:35.735
to plant a blue bean
in my sploagie.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.637
Then Phoebe's
Russian alter-ego

20:37.737 --> 20:40.273
provided the perfect
opportunity...

20:40.373 --> 20:41.908
- Oopsa-doopsie.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.776
- MAX: For Colosso
to escape.

20:43.876 --> 20:49.081
And like that...poof...
he was gone.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.883
- And I woulda gotten
away with it, too,

20:50.983 --> 20:52.719
if it wasn't for
your girlfriend--

20:52.819 --> 20:54.521
little Miss Mucous.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.523
The only piece
of the puzzle

20:56.623 --> 20:58.491
is why would you do
this, Dr. Colosso?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.860
- Fine! I'll tell you.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.963
For two weeks, you've been
yappin' about this Maddy girl.

21:04.063 --> 21:08.935
Maddy this. Maddy that.
Maddy. Maddy. Maddy. Maddy.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.037
- You did all this
just to get rid of her?

21:11.137 --> 21:14.173
- I didn't wanna lose
my best friend.

21:14.341 --> 21:18.611
My only crime
is loving you.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.448
That, plus,
all my actual crimes.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.584
- Hey, we'll always be buds,

21:24.684 --> 21:26.586
no matter who
I go out with.

21:26.686 --> 21:33.660
- [music surging dramatically]

21:33.760 --> 21:37.597
- Max has bigger issues
than being blue.

21:37.697 --> 21:41.233
- Hey, if this is all about
your creepy love triangle,

21:41.368 --> 21:43.202
uh, why'd you turn
me blue, Colosso?

21:43.370 --> 21:45.372
- Oh, that was me.
[laughing]

21:45.438 --> 21:48.274
I thought it'd be hilarious
and I was right.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.510
- Oh, ho, ho, really?
- Yeah.

21:50.610 --> 21:54.013
- [powers zapping]
- [yelping]

21:54.113 --> 21:55.882
- [objects clattering]

21:55.982 --> 21:57.917
- Now that was hilarious.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.687
Now who wants to play
with Fun Claw and grab Colosso?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.254
- HANK: [laughing]

22:02.389 --> 22:04.290
- COLOSSO: Wait! No!
No, no, no, no, no.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.958
Don't do that.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.694
That's a bad idea

22:07.794 --> 22:09.529
because I just got
my cape cleaned!

22:12.465 --> 22:28.415
