WEBVTT

00:07.708 --> 00:10.010
MELISSA & JOEY IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.482 --> 00:12.642
ALL SET TO SHOOT YOUR SEGMENT?

00:12.643 --> 00:14.414
OH, ALMOST, KYLE.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.515
- HEY, JOE.
- YEAH.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.617
WHICH POSE SAYS "ELECT
ME TO STATE SENATE,

00:17.618 --> 00:20.120
BUT I'M ALSO SEXY,
FUN, AND DATEABLE..."

00:20.121 --> 00:22.322
THE FINGER ON THE CHIN
OR THE HAND ON THE HIP?

00:22.323 --> 00:25.225
I THINK THIS IS
WAY MORE BEYONCE.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.356
BURKE, YOU'RE STANDING
IN THE KITCHEN.

00:26.357 --> 00:28.459
THE WHOLE SETUP IS
REALLY UNBELIEVABLE.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.061
Kyle: OKAY, WE ARE GOOD TO GO.

00:31.062 --> 00:34.734
THIS IS HOUSEHOLD SAFETY
SPOT, TAKE ONE...

00:34.735 --> 00:36.106
AND GO.

00:36.107 --> 00:39.139
HELLO, TOLEDO. I'M
COUNCILWOMAN MEL BURKE.

00:39.140 --> 00:42.612
AND IF DISASTER STRIKES, I
WANT YOU TO BE PREPARED.

00:42.613 --> 00:44.274
YOU KNOW, IT IS EASY

00:44.275 --> 00:45.645
TO PREPARE YOURSELF BY
STOCKING YOUR KITCHEN

00:45.646 --> 00:48.047
WITH EMERGENCY
WATER, CANNED GOODS,

00:48.048 --> 00:51.422
AND A MANUAL CAN OPENER,
JUST LIKE THE COWBOY DAYS.

00:52.783 --> 00:55.625
UH, AND YOU JUST...

00:55.626 --> 00:57.087
OOP.

00:57.088 --> 01:00.090
I'M USED TO USING THE
ELECTRIC KIND, BUT...

01:00.091 --> 01:02.061
OKAY, WELL, NO
WONDER THE COWBOYS

01:02.062 --> 01:03.333
USED TO ALWAYS SHOOT
AT EACH OTHER.

01:03.334 --> 01:05.064
( chuckles ) UM...

01:05.065 --> 01:06.297
COME ON, BESSIE!

01:07.798 --> 01:09.399
ALLOW ME, COUNCILWOMAN.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.241
- ( clears throat )
- OKAY, LET THIS POP.

01:11.242 --> 01:13.443
- THERE WE GO.
- OKAY.

01:13.444 --> 01:16.075
- I LOOSENED IT FOR YOU.
- ( laughs )

01:16.076 --> 01:18.348
BY BANGING IT AGAINST THE
COUNTER LIKE A MONKEY.

01:18.349 --> 01:19.679
THIS IS JOE

01:19.680 --> 01:22.152
- MY CAN OPENER.
- WOW, CAN OPENER.

01:22.153 --> 01:23.353
THAT WOULD BE A PROMOTION.

01:23.354 --> 01:25.216
OKAY, HOW ABOUT CAN
OPEN, MOUTH CLOSED?

01:26.617 --> 01:29.119
ALL RIGHT, JOE, YOU CAN TAKE
A FEW STEPS TO THE RIGHT.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.221
- WELL, I...
- NO, SO THE CAMERA CAN'T SEE YOU.

01:31.222 --> 01:33.593
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, UM...
( clears throat )

01:33.594 --> 01:34.864
WHERE WAS I?

01:34.865 --> 01:36.566
WELL, YOU WERE HAVING
TROUBLE OPENING THIS CAN.

01:36.567 --> 01:37.867
AND THEN I CAME
IN AND SAVED YOU.

01:37.868 --> 01:39.369
AND NOW YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

01:39.370 --> 01:40.630
TO HAVE BOTTLED WATER ON HAND.

01:40.631 --> 01:41.801
ABSOLUTELY.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.175
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE
TWO GOOD-SIZED JUGS.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.778
I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.710
THAT WAS GREAT.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.612
WE'LL START AIRING THESE ON "GOOD
MORNING TOLEDO" RIGHT AWAY.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.644
YOU KNOW, MEL, YOU ARE
A NATURAL ON CAMERA.

01:54.645 --> 01:55.715
OH, I KNOW. BACK IN COLLEGE,

01:55.716 --> 01:57.147
DURING SPRING BREAK,

01:57.148 --> 01:59.289
I WAS ONE OF THE VERY
FIRST GIRLS TO GO WILD.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.790
LISTEN,

02:00.791 --> 02:02.722
I'M LOSING MY REGULAR
HOST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.194
HE'S HAVING A LITTLE
MEDICAL PROCEDURE.

02:04.195 --> 02:05.255
CAN'T SAY MUCH MORE THAN THAT,

02:05.256 --> 02:07.727
BUT, UH...

02:07.728 --> 02:09.799
I HEAR YOU. MY MOM'S
ALL ABOUT THE...

02:09.800 --> 02:10.830
NOT TO MENTION THE...
( whistles )

02:10.831 --> 02:13.163
AND THE... ( sucking sound ).

02:13.164 --> 02:14.404
SAY NO MORE.

02:14.405 --> 02:15.835
SO HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO
BE GUEST HOST FOR A WEEK?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.407
- ME?
- MM-HMM.

02:17.408 --> 02:18.868
OH, THAT'S VERY FLATTERING,

02:18.869 --> 02:20.370
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

02:20.371 --> 02:22.712
WITH MY WORK SCHEDULE AND THE
STATE SENATE CAMPAIGN...

02:22.713 --> 02:24.214
IT WOULD PUT YOUR FACE
IN FRONT OF THE VOTERS.

02:24.215 --> 02:25.345
AFTER ALL, MOST PEOPLE VOTE

02:25.346 --> 02:26.576
FOR THE MOST FAMOUS
NAME ON THE BALLOT.

02:26.577 --> 02:28.147
AS OUR FOREFATHERS INTENDED.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.249
I MEAN YOU THINK LINCOLN
WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED

02:29.250 --> 02:30.780
WITHOUT THAT MOVIE?

02:30.781 --> 02:32.252
EXACTLY.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.283
SO YOU ON BOARD?

02:33.284 --> 02:36.186
WELL, I CAN'T SAY NO TO OHIO.

02:36.187 --> 02:37.527
THAT'S GREAT. HEY, JOE,

02:37.528 --> 02:39.429
- SHE'S IN.
- HEY, FANTASTIC.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.530
WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:40.531 --> 02:42.532
HI, I'M YOUR NEW CO-HOST.

02:42.533 --> 02:44.464
WHAT? NO, I'M THE HOST.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.165
THERE'S NO CO-ANYTHING.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.438
I SPARKLED ON CAMERA.
YOU JUST OPENED A CAN.

02:48.439 --> 02:50.241
A CAN OF AWESOME.

02:51.442 --> 02:52.902
SEE? THIS SNAPPY BACK-AND-FORTH,

02:52.903 --> 02:54.304
THAT'S TV GOLD.

02:54.305 --> 02:55.445
THAT'S WHAT NEXT WEEK
IS GONNA BE ALL ABOUT.

02:55.446 --> 02:56.546
NO, NO, NO. I CAN DO
THE BACK-AND-FORTH

02:56.547 --> 02:57.907
ALL BY MYSELF. NO, YOU CAN'T.

02:57.908 --> 02:59.779
YES, I CAN.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.811
WAIT, I FORGET WHICH
ONE I AM NOW.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.854
FINE, I'LL CO-HOST.

HEY, GOOD MORNING, BUDDY.

03:28.779 --> 03:30.610
I'M ACTUALLY FEELING
GENEROUS TODAY.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.211
SO HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE A LITTLE
BREAK FROM YOUR SCHOOLWORK

03:32.212 --> 03:34.614
AND YOU WATCH YOUR AUNT AND
I ON "GOOD MORNING TOLEDO"?

03:34.615 --> 03:38.548
I'D RATHER DO CHEMISTRY OR
SLAM MY FINGERS IN A DRAWER.

03:38.549 --> 03:39.949
YEAH, I KNOW.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.421
YOU CAN JUST PRESS THE MUTE
BUTTON WHEN YOUR AUNT TALKS.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.992
THAT'S WHAT I USUALLY
DO IN MY HEAD.

03:42.993 --> 03:44.324
OH NO.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.356
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU
TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF.

03:46.357 --> 03:47.457
WHAT? WHY?

03:47.458 --> 03:48.998
IT'S THE SAME COLOR AS MY DRESS.

03:48.999 --> 03:49.999
ARE YOU CRAZY?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.601
THIS SHIRT IS
CERULEAN, ALL RIGHT?

03:51.602 --> 03:54.834
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING THERE,
THAT'S LIKE COBALT AT BEST.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.905
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS CERULEAN.

03:55.906 --> 03:57.367
RYDER, AM I WRONG?

03:57.368 --> 03:59.909
YEAH, LIKE I WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

03:59.910 --> 04:02.472
WE LOOK LIKE A SINGING
DUO FROM THE '70s.

04:02.473 --> 04:03.643
NO, YOU'VE GOT TO
CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.714
WHY DO I HAVE TO CHANGE?

04:04.715 --> 04:05.815
BECAUSE YOU AND I

04:05.816 --> 04:06.916
HAVE TO LEAVE IN FIVE MINUTES.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.618
AND YOUR OUTFIT DOESN'T INVOLVE

04:08.619 --> 04:10.550
COMPLICATED ELASTIC
UNDERGARMENTS...

04:10.551 --> 04:11.981
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

04:11.982 --> 04:14.454
FINE, I'LL CHANGE.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.555
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
LUCKY I LOOK GOOD

04:15.556 --> 04:16.626
IN EVERY COLOR OF THE RAINBOW.

04:16.627 --> 04:19.258
EXCEPT LIKE TAUPE OR BEIGE

04:19.259 --> 04:21.391
BECAUSE THEY SORT OF
JUST LIKE BLAH ME OUT.

04:21.392 --> 04:23.593
LENNOX, BREAKFAST!

04:23.594 --> 04:24.694
WHERE IS YOUR SISTER?

04:24.695 --> 04:25.965
OH, SHE GOT IN LATE LAST NIGHT.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.867
I COULD TELL BY HER
DISTINCTIVE DOOR-SLAM.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.268
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LATE?

04:29.269 --> 04:29.940
SHE WAS AT A YEARBOOK
MEETING AT EMMA'S HOUSE.

04:29.941 --> 04:31.941
OKAY.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.343
LIGHTEN UP, JOE.
I'M SURE THEY JUST

04:33.344 --> 04:34.604
WATCHED A MOVIE
AFTER THE MEETING.

04:34.605 --> 04:35.676
YOU KNOW, INNOCENT FUN.

04:36.977 --> 04:37.977
HEY, EVERYBODY.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.409
THERE SHE IS.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.381
HEY, EVERYBODY.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.283
AND THERE HE IS...

04:44.284 --> 04:45.615
MYSTERIOUSLY COMING
FROM THE SAME DIRECTION

04:45.616 --> 04:46.686
AS LENNOX'S BEDROOM.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.859
I'M SURE NOTHING
INAPPROPRIATE HAPPENED.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.591
RYDER, GET OUT.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.463
BUT THIS COULD BE GOOD.

04:53.464 --> 04:55.064
- OUT!
- FINE.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.526
YOU KNOW, I MISS
ALL THE FUN STUFF.

04:56.527 --> 04:57.867
ONE OF THESE DAY,
I'M GONNA RUN AWAY,

04:57.868 --> 04:58.928
BUILD MY OWN HOUSE IN THE WOODS,

04:58.929 --> 05:00.300
AND THEN YOU'LL BE SORRY.

05:02.473 --> 05:05.435
SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL US WHY

05:05.436 --> 05:07.537
ZANDER IS JOINING US FOR
BREAKFAST THIS MORNING?

05:07.538 --> 05:09.779
ABSOLUTELY. HE SPENT
THE NIGHT HERE

05:09.780 --> 05:11.511
BECAUSE IT WAS THE
RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.012
SEE, JOE, RESPONSIBLE.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.485
LAST NIGHT AT EMMA'S,
HE HAD A FEW BEERS.

05:15.486 --> 05:17.587
ROOT BEERS, I'M SURE.

05:17.588 --> 05:18.948
RIGHT, YES.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.690
AND WITH ALL OF THOSE
IMPORTED ROOT BEERS

05:20.691 --> 05:22.852
IN HIS SYSTEM, I DIDN'T
WANT HIM TO DRIVE HOME.

05:22.853 --> 05:23.893
SO WE WALKED BACK FROM EMMA'S

05:23.894 --> 05:25.355
AND SPENT THE NIGHT
HERE AND THEN...

05:25.356 --> 05:28.528
PLEASE, NO MORE "THEN."
STOP AT "THEN."

05:28.529 --> 05:29.559
NOTHING HAPPENED.
AFTER THE BEERS,

05:29.560 --> 05:30.801
I WASN'T REALLY UP FOR IT.

05:32.703 --> 05:35.064
OH, THAT'S SO KIND OF YOU.

05:35.065 --> 05:36.836
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
YOUR PARENTS WOULD BE

05:36.837 --> 05:38.668
TOO THRILLED TO FIND
OUT ABOUT ALL THIS.

05:38.669 --> 05:39.869
NO, NO, NO. PLEASE, PLEASE.
I'LL TELL THEM MYSELF.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.541
I'LL TOTALLY COME CLEAN.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.872
AND IF I'M LYING,

05:42.873 --> 05:44.674
MAY I LOSE MY ABILITY
TO DRAW HANDS.

05:44.675 --> 05:48.017
THAT'S SERIOUS... 'CAUSE HE
IS VERY GOOD AT DRAWING HANDS

05:48.018 --> 05:49.018
AND BREASTS.

05:49.019 --> 05:51.350
OH MY GOD.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.652
OKAY, I'M SURE WE CAN ALL AGREE

05:52.653 --> 05:53.783
THAT ZANDER IS VERY GIFTED,

05:53.784 --> 05:55.755
BUT I VOTE THAT WE ALLOW ZANDER

05:55.756 --> 05:56.856
TO TELL HIS FOLKS HIMSELF.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.958
BUT IF YOU DON'T, I WILL UNLEASH

05:58.959 --> 06:00.931
THIS OVERLY BUILT
RAGE MONSTER ON YOU.

06:02.633 --> 06:05.595
PERFECTLY PROPORTIONED
RAGE MONSTER.

06:05.596 --> 06:07.667
IT'S UNDERSTOOD.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.368
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, MEL.
WE GOT TO JAM.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.500
BUT YOU GOT TO CHANGE FIRST.

06:10.501 --> 06:11.771
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I ALWAYS KEEP

06:11.772 --> 06:13.573
A FRESHLY PRESSED SUIT
AND SHIRT IN THE CAR.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.074
FOR WHAT? IN CASE YOU'RE
SITTING AT A RED LIGHT

06:15.075 --> 06:17.147
AND SOMEBODY SUDDENLY OFFERS
YOU AN EXECUTIVE JOB?

06:18.949 --> 06:20.611
IT COULD HAPPEN.

06:22.983 --> 06:23.983
AND THAT'S WHY TOMATOES

06:23.984 --> 06:25.755
SHOULD BE YOUR
FAVORITE VEGETABLE.

06:25.756 --> 06:27.917
ACTUALLY, JOE, YOU MAY
DISAGREE WITH ME,

06:27.918 --> 06:29.959
BUT TOMATOES ARE A FRUIT.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.461
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:31.462 --> 06:34.664
NO ARGUMENT THERE BECAUSE THE
SEEDS ARE ON THE INSIDE.

06:34.665 --> 06:36.796
Mel: INDEED THEY ARE.
AND WE WILL

06:36.797 --> 06:38.728
SEED YOU BACK HERE

06:38.729 --> 06:40.700
RIGHT AFTER THIS
COMMERCIAL MESSAGE.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.872
AND WE'RE CLEAR.

06:42.873 --> 06:45.575
SO HOW DO YOU GUYS
THINK IT'S GOING?

06:45.576 --> 06:46.576
- PRETTY GOOD.
- WELL, WE'RE GETTING...

06:46.577 --> 06:47.977
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

06:47.978 --> 06:48.978
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

06:48.979 --> 06:50.039
IT'S OUR FIRST DAY.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.881
THIS IS TOLEDO TELEVISION.

06:51.882 --> 06:53.583
YOU GOT TO BRING IT
AND BRING IT NOW.

06:53.584 --> 06:56.116
I WANT TO SEE SPARKS,
CHEMISTRY, BACK-AND-FORTH.

06:58.188 --> 06:59.919
HEY, I'M PROVIDING THE BACK.
WHERE ARE YOU WITH THE FORTH?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.020
ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.121
I'M DOING DOUBLE-DUTY HERE.
YOU KNOW WHY?

07:02.122 --> 07:03.053
I'M DOING THE BACK AND
I'M DOING THE FORTH.

07:03.054 --> 07:04.594
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

07:04.595 --> 07:05.655
I THINK YOU'RE STILL
DISTRACTED ABOUT THAT THING

07:05.656 --> 07:06.826
WITH LENNOX AND
ZANDER THIS MORNING.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.957
OH, EXCUSE ME FOR BEING WORRIED

07:07.958 --> 07:09.599
ABOUT A DRUNK TEENAGE BOY

07:09.600 --> 07:10.800
SLEEPING OVER IN YOUR
NIECE'S BEDROOM.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.001
YOU SHOULD BE A LITTLE
DISTRACTED ABOUT THAT TOO.

07:12.002 --> 07:13.903
SLEEPING, JOE. THEY
WERE JUST SLEEPING.

07:13.904 --> 07:15.765
AH, MAYBE THEY SLEPT AFTERWARDS.

07:15.766 --> 07:17.637
OKAY, BEFORE YOU SCHEDULE
THE HONOR KILLING,

07:17.638 --> 07:19.469
WE BOTH KNOW LENNOX AND
ZANDER ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.571
ANYWAY, YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
THAT ZANDER WAS TOO DRUNK

07:21.572 --> 07:22.973
TO HAVE SEX WITH
LENNOX LAST NIGHT.

07:25.576 --> 07:28.178
UH, HOW LONG HAS THAT
ON-AIR LIGHT BEEN ON?

07:29.620 --> 07:31.851
JUDGING BY THE SMILE
ON KYLE'S FACE,

07:31.852 --> 07:34.223
I THINK IT'S BEEN
ON FOR A WHILE.

07:34.224 --> 07:35.955
( mouthing silently )

07:35.956 --> 07:38.858
OKAY, WELL, IT WOULD APPEAR

07:38.859 --> 07:40.990
THAT SOME OF OUR
PERSONAL CONVERSATION

07:40.991 --> 07:43.062
HAS MADE ITS WAY ONTO THE AIR.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.764
AND PERHAPS MY CO-HOST

07:44.765 --> 07:46.035
COULD BE A LITTLE MORE
DISCREET IN THE FUTURE.

07:46.036 --> 07:47.867
OH, WAIT A MINUTE NOW. YOU'RE
THE ONE THAT BROUGHT UP

07:47.868 --> 07:49.098
THE WHOLE LENNOX-ZANDER THING.

07:49.099 --> 07:51.941
AND APPARENTLY, THE FUTURE
HAS NOT YET ARRIVED.

07:51.942 --> 07:54.844
AND IT'S NOT LIKE HE
HASN'T SLEPT OVER BEFORE.

07:54.845 --> 07:56.976
WHAT?! WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.048
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

07:59.049 --> 08:01.010
YES, IT IS... WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT

08:01.011 --> 08:03.152
A UNDERAGE BOY AND GIRL
HAVING SEX IN YOUR HOUSE.

08:03.153 --> 08:05.815
SEE NOW, THIS IS
GOOD TELEVISION.

08:05.816 --> 08:08.718
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT IS TIME

08:08.719 --> 08:09.920
TO GO TO ANOTHER
COMMERCIAL BREAK.

08:10.961 --> 08:12.722
( mouthing silently )

08:12.723 --> 08:15.665
NO? IT'S NOT TIME
FOR A COMMERCIAL?

08:15.666 --> 08:16.996
LET ME HANDLE THIS.
KYLE, WE NEED TO GO

08:16.997 --> 08:18.227
TO A COMMERCIAL RIGHT NOW.

08:18.228 --> 08:20.030
OKAY? ( snaps )

08:21.572 --> 08:22.933
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.777
OKAY, I'M LEARNING A LOT HERE.

08:28.078 --> 08:29.639
DEAR GOD, IF YOU REALLY EXIST,

08:29.640 --> 08:31.111
PLEASE SEND A
COMMERCIAL TO SAVE US.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.847
HEY LOOK, BEFORE WE GO IN THERE,

08:37.848 --> 08:39.018
I DON'T THINK LENNOX IS GONNA
BE TOO THRILLED WITH THE FACT

08:39.019 --> 08:40.289
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT
HER SEX LIFE ON TV.

08:40.290 --> 08:44.193
SO DO YOU HAVE A PLAN OR
MAYBE SOME BODY ARMOR?

08:44.194 --> 08:47.957
WELL, I'M PREPARED TO FACE HER
WITH HONESTY AND HUMILITY...

08:47.958 --> 08:49.859
AND THIS $100 GIFT CARD.

08:49.860 --> 08:52.131
A BRIBE? OH, THAT'S
JUST GREAT PARENTING.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.004
CAN IT BE FROM BOTH OF US?

08:55.005 --> 08:56.266
NO, YOU'RE ON YOUR
OWN, LOUDMOUTH.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.540
HEY, LENNOX.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.812
WHAT?

09:02.813 --> 09:04.614
LOOK, HONEY, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

09:04.615 --> 09:06.175
I MEAN SOMETIMES STUFF
COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

09:06.176 --> 09:08.678
AND YOU CAN'T STUFF IT BACK IN.

09:08.679 --> 09:10.079
OH MY GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED?

09:10.080 --> 09:11.781
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

09:11.782 --> 09:12.982
JOE, SHE DIDN'T SEE IT!

09:12.983 --> 09:16.085
NO, I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN
STUDYING FOR FINALS.

09:16.086 --> 09:18.287
BUT WE CAN WATCH IT TOGETHER
ON THE D.V.R RIGHT NOW.

09:18.288 --> 09:21.591
- YES, THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.
- IT IS?

09:21.592 --> 09:23.032
HOLD ON. I'M GONNA PULL
THIS THING UP RIGHT NOW.

09:23.033 --> 09:24.894
- THERE IT IS. HERE WE GO.
- ( beeps )

09:24.895 --> 09:27.937
OH MY GOODNESS... I JUST PRESSED
PERMANENT DELETE ON THAT THING.

09:27.938 --> 09:30.039
WHAT IS MY PROBLEM? NOW
IT'S GONE FOREVER.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.741
DAMN, JOE.

09:31.742 --> 09:33.072
NOW YOU'LL NEVER GET TO SEE IT.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.844
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
NOT MISSING ANYTHING.

09:34.845 --> 09:36.976
OH, I GET IT.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.980
YOU GUYS ARE EMBARRASSED
BECAUSE YOU SUCKED.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.112
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE JUST BORING

09:43.113 --> 09:44.283
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
INTERESTING TO SAY.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.584
( doorbell rings )

09:45.585 --> 09:47.817
- THAT'S IT.
- YEP, ON THE NOSE.

09:47.818 --> 09:49.760
WE GOT AWAY WITH IT.
SHE'LL NEVER FIND OUT.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.092
ZANDER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.924
MY PARENTS KICKED ME OUT.

09:54.925 --> 09:56.225
THEY HEARD WHAT THESE
TWO SAID ON TV.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.297
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

09:58.298 --> 10:00.299
UM...

10:00.300 --> 10:02.932
YOU KNOW WE WERE ON THE
AIR FOR TWO HOURS.

10:02.933 --> 10:05.074
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.

10:05.075 --> 10:06.876
THEY JUST SAID THAT WE
HAVE SEX ALL THE TIME...

10:06.877 --> 10:08.607
OH, UNLESS I'M TOO DRUNK.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.811
THAT WAS JUST A TINY
PART OF THE SEGMENT.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.243
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ON TV?

10:14.244 --> 10:17.116
IN OUR DEFENSE, THAT
ON-AIR LIGHT...

10:17.117 --> 10:18.919
IT'S VERY TINY,
VERY HARD TO SEE.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.351
IT'S NOT LIKE WE KICKED
YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE.

10:22.352 --> 10:24.123
IF WE'RE POINTING FINGERS,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.756
REALLY WE SHOULD POINT
ONE AT ZANDER'S PARENTS.

10:26.757 --> 10:29.158
THEY KICKED HIM OUT
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID.

10:29.159 --> 10:30.960
OKAY, LOOK, ZANDER,

10:30.961 --> 10:31.961
I'M GONNA CALL YOUR
PARENTS RIGHT NOW

10:31.962 --> 10:33.102
AND EXPLAIN HOW THIS WHOLE THING

10:33.103 --> 10:34.133
GOT BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.665
WHAT? NO! DON'T CALL.

10:35.666 --> 10:37.166
NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT
YOU RIGHT NOW.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.938
THEY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
YOU BEING TOO PERMISSIVE

10:38.939 --> 10:41.040
AND GOING TO HELL.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.912
I'M NOT JUDGING, JUST REPORTING.

10:42.913 --> 10:45.014
OKAY, WELL, LOOK, ZANDER,
YOU CAN STAY HERE

10:45.015 --> 10:46.976
UNTIL EVERYTHING COOLS
DOWN AT YOUR HOUSE.

10:46.977 --> 10:48.317
- THANKS, I APPRECIATE IT.
- YEAH, SURE.

10:48.318 --> 10:51.080
YOU CAN SLEEP IN MY ROOM
DUCT-TAPED TO MY WEIGHT BENCH.

10:51.081 --> 10:52.922
JOE, YOU'RE THE NANNY,
NOT THE PRISON GUARD.

10:52.923 --> 10:54.223
( chuckles )

10:54.224 --> 10:56.285
I CAN BE BOTH.

10:56.286 --> 10:59.428
LOOK, HONEY, I FEEL REALLY
TERRIBLE ABOUT WHAT I SAID TODAY.

10:59.429 --> 11:00.990
SO TOMORROW, I'M
GONNA OPEN THE SHOW

11:00.991 --> 11:02.732
- WITH A BIG APOLOGY.
- NO!

11:02.733 --> 11:04.433
DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ON TV.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.135
DON'T EVEN MENTION MY NAME.

11:06.136 --> 11:07.366
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
IF I CLARIFIED...

11:07.367 --> 11:10.170
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

11:11.301 --> 11:14.073
I RESPECT YOUR WISHES, L...
WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.406
UM, BUT WHO DO I GIVE
THIS $100 GIFT CARD TO

11:17.407 --> 11:19.249
THAT'S MADE OUT TO
LENNOX SCANLON?

11:20.210 --> 11:22.112
I'LL MAKE SURE SHE GETS IT.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.356
MEL, JOE, HOW ARE MY
TWO FIRECRACKERS?

11:27.357 --> 11:29.158
EVERYBODY ONLINE'S LOVING
THE BACK-AND-FORTH.

11:29.159 --> 11:30.219
KEEP IT UP.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.721
YOU GOT IT, PRODUCER MAN.

11:31.722 --> 11:33.023
- ( tongue clicks )
- HEY YEAH. ( tongue clicks )

11:34.224 --> 11:35.925
I'M TELLING YOU, MEL.
WE ARE A HIT.

11:35.926 --> 11:39.228
OKAY, WHAT MADE YOU SO
HAPPY-GO-JOE ALL OF A SUDDEN?

11:39.229 --> 11:40.870
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MADE ME HAPPY?

11:40.871 --> 11:42.431
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS,
WHEN I GOOGLE MYSELF,

11:42.432 --> 11:44.173
FINANCIAL SCANDAL ISN'T THE
ONLY THING THAT COMES UP.

11:44.174 --> 11:46.776
WAIT, HOW OFTEN DO
YOU GOOGLE YOURSELF?

11:46.777 --> 11:48.207
NO MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.479
I MEAN, JUST SOMETIMES AT NIGHT

11:50.480 --> 11:52.341
BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP. I MEAN,
THE COMPUTER'S RIGHT THERE,

11:52.342 --> 11:53.784
SO I JUST...

11:54.885 --> 11:56.185
IT HELPS ME SLEEP. DON'T
GIVE ME THAT LOOK!

11:56.186 --> 11:57.788
YOU DO IT TOO!

12:00.320 --> 12:03.152
Mel: JAMIE, YOU WROTE THE
BOOK ON SCHOOL LUNCHES.

12:03.153 --> 12:05.224
SO WHICH IS THE BIGGER
VILLAIN HERE...

12:05.225 --> 12:07.026
TATER TOTS OR FRENCH FRIES?

12:07.027 --> 12:09.228
ACTUALLY, I WATCHED
THE SHOW YESTERDAY

12:09.229 --> 12:10.930
AND I THINK THE REAL HOT TOPIC

12:10.931 --> 12:12.201
IS WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE DRUNK BOY

12:12.202 --> 12:13.202
WHO SLEPT WITH YOUR NIECE.

12:13.203 --> 12:15.334
OH.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.236
YEAH, NOBODY WANTS
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.809
( applause, cheering )

12:19.810 --> 12:23.742
OKAY. WELL, MAYBE
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.315
MY WIFE AND I GOT INTO A BIG
DISAGREEMENT LAST NIGHT

12:26.316 --> 12:28.247
ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS HANDLED
THAT THING WITH LENNOX.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.348
AH, NO NAMES. NO NAMES.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.950
MY NIECE IS A LITTLE SENSITIVE,

12:30.951 --> 12:32.751
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE
TOO TOUCHY-WOUCHY.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.153
( television chatter )

12:34.154 --> 12:36.786
- I'M TOO TOUCHY-WOUCHY?!
- NO, NO.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.027
GUYS, PLEASE, I'M
TRYING TO WATCH

12:38.028 --> 12:39.259
MY FAVORITE MORNING TV SHOW.

12:41.091 --> 12:42.261
NEITHER ONE OF YOU GUYS

12:42.262 --> 12:44.864
KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE
TEENAGERS AT ALL.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.065
WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY FAIR

12:46.066 --> 12:47.536
BECAUSE LE... ( coughs )

12:47.537 --> 12:51.000
THE GIRL-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED

12:51.001 --> 12:53.372
IS NOT THE ONLY TEENAGER WE
HAVE LIVING IN OUR HOUSE.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.804
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TEENAGE
BOY IN OUR HOUSE.

12:54.805 --> 12:56.105
WE HAVE NONE OF THESE
PROBLEMS WITH HIM.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.547
SO HE'S NOT GETTING DRUNK
AND SLEEPING AROUND?

12:58.548 --> 13:00.249
GOD, NO. TRUST ME.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.480
NOT RYDER.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.552
UH, NO NAMES. NO NAMES.

13:03.553 --> 13:05.084
YEAH, SORRY. NO.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.317
BUT MY POINT IS THAT
THE NAMELESS YOUNG MAN

13:08.318 --> 13:10.189
IS IN NO WAY SEXUALLY ACTIVE.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.892
AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT HAPPENING FOR HIM

13:12.893 --> 13:16.495
- for a long, long time.
- OH GOD.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.528
MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP!

13:19.930 --> 13:21.330
OUCH, I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.272
DON'T WORRY, BRO'.
I GOT YOUR BACK.

13:23.273 --> 13:25.304
OVER-SHARING IS A
TWO-WAY STREET.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.535
( computer beeps )

13:26.536 --> 13:28.377
SO THE BOY HAS SOCIAL PROBLEMS.

13:28.378 --> 13:29.839
HE'S ODD.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.810
NO, I WOULDN'T SAY ODD.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.212
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW, HE...

13:33.213 --> 13:35.214
HE JUST TENDS TO ROLL SOLO.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.146
YOU KNOW? I MEAN NOT...

13:36.147 --> 13:37.816
NOT LIKE ALONE IN HIS ROOM

13:37.817 --> 13:39.148
WITH PORNOGRAPHY OR ANYTHING.

13:39.149 --> 13:41.490
I DON'T THINK. I MEAN, I JUST...

13:41.491 --> 13:43.392
YOU KNOW, I... I... I...

13:43.393 --> 13:46.155
SEE, HE'S... I MEANT THAT...

13:46.156 --> 13:48.427
I... HE'S A... HE'S A...

13:48.428 --> 13:50.159
I... WHAT DID I MEAN, BURKE?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.431
YOU MEANT THAT IT IS TIME

13:52.432 --> 13:55.104
TO GO TO OUR SOCIAL-MEDIA
CORRESPONDENT,

13:55.105 --> 13:56.505
ASHLEY, AND HER SEGMENT,
"WHAT'S TRENDING?"

13:56.506 --> 13:57.506
ASHLEY?

13:57.507 --> 13:59.869
WELL, MEL, TURNS OUT
YOU'RE TRENDING.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.971
OH, GOOD. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

14:01.972 --> 14:03.542
OKAY, SO WHAT'S THE
BUZZ, GIRLFRIEND?

14:03.543 --> 14:06.115
CHECK OUT THIS TWEET
I GOT SECONDS AGO

14:06.116 --> 14:08.277
FROM @LENNOXSCANLON13.

14:08.278 --> 14:12.251
"AUNT MEL TALKS A LOT ABOUT
HOW MUCH OTHER PEOPLE DRINK,

14:12.252 --> 14:14.553
BUT IT TAKES HER THREE
GLASSES OF WINE

14:14.554 --> 14:16.085
TO UNWIND FROM A TOUGH DAY.

14:16.086 --> 14:18.627
HYPOCRITE MUCH?"

14:18.628 --> 14:19.929
Audience: OOH.

14:19.930 --> 14:24.633
OH, MY NIECE IS SUCH
A PRACTICAL JOKER.

14:24.634 --> 14:26.295
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE

14:26.296 --> 14:28.097
EVERYTHING YOU READ ON
THE INTERNET, ASHLEY.

14:28.098 --> 14:29.099
OH, AND SHE LINKED THIS PHOTO.

14:31.641 --> 14:32.943
THAT COULD BE ANYBODY.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.047
- AH!
- ( laughter )

14:44.654 --> 14:46.355
JOE, HOLD MY PURSE.

14:46.356 --> 14:48.087
STRANGLING LENNOX IS GONNA
BE A TWO-HANDED JOB.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.258
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

14:49.259 --> 14:51.190
CALM DOWN THERE, KILLER.
BEFORE WE GO IN THERE,

14:51.191 --> 14:53.062
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A DEEP
BREATH AND COUNT TO TEN.

14:53.063 --> 14:54.924
- ALL RIGHT?
- TEN!

14:54.925 --> 14:56.295
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

14:56.296 --> 14:57.927
YOU TOTALLY HUMILIATED ME.

14:57.928 --> 15:01.430
GOSH, AUNT MEL, AREN'T YOU BEING
A LITTLE TOO TOUCHY-WOUCHY?

15:01.431 --> 15:04.673
THAT WAS ON TV IN FRONT OF
A LOT OF POTENTIAL VOTERS.

15:04.674 --> 15:08.537
OH, SO IT WAS AN INAPPROPRIATE
FORUM FOR PERSONAL BUSINESS?

15:08.538 --> 15:10.079
LADIES, PLEASE, LET'S NOT GO

15:10.080 --> 15:12.241
ALL ROLLER DERBY ON
EACH OTHER HERE, OKAY?

15:12.242 --> 15:13.642
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

15:13.643 --> 15:16.445
SO YOU TALKED ABOUT ME ON TV
FOR THE SECOND DAY IN A ROW

15:16.446 --> 15:17.486
ACCIDENTALLY?

15:17.487 --> 15:19.218
EXACTLY!

15:19.219 --> 15:20.549
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
TALKING ON THAT SHOW,

15:20.550 --> 15:21.550
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

15:21.551 --> 15:23.253
WH... LENNOX.

15:25.195 --> 15:27.396
SHE'S GONNA COOL DOWN.
WON'T SHE?

15:27.397 --> 15:29.698
LOOK, MEL, YOU GOT TO EXPECT
SOME SORT OF REACTION

15:29.699 --> 15:31.430
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A
GIRL'S PERSONAL LIFE ON TV.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.332
WHO'S SIDE ARE YOU ON, CO-HOST?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.434
HEY LOOK, ADMIT IT. YOU
KNOW, YOU WERE WRONG.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.206
I MEAN, YOU SCREWED THE POOCH.

15:37.207 --> 15:38.938
HEY, JOE.

15:41.411 --> 15:43.543
THANKS FOR NEUTERING ME ON TV.

15:46.016 --> 15:49.478
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT SEX
WAS NEVER ON MY BUCKET LIST.

15:49.479 --> 15:52.551
ALL I SAID WAS YOU WERE A VIRTUOUS
YOUNG MAN WHO IS RESPECTFUL OF WOMEN.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.483
YEAH, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ALL
THE WOMEN ARE LOOKING FOR,

15:54.484 --> 15:57.426
YOU KNOW, THE GUY WITH
THE HOT, HOT VIRTUE.

15:57.427 --> 15:59.388
YOU CALLED ME A SEXUAL ZERO.

15:59.389 --> 16:02.091
EVERYBODY STARTS AT ZERO, PAL,

16:02.092 --> 16:04.363
YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU SCORE.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.435
WELL, NOW I'M GONNA HAVE
TO MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY

16:06.436 --> 16:08.498
WHERE WOMEN HAVE NEVER SEEN TV.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.570
( scoffs )

16:12.002 --> 16:13.172
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

16:13.173 --> 16:16.376
SOMEONE WHO DID VERY
BAD THINGS TO A POOCH.

16:20.010 --> 16:21.480
IS WATER GOOD,

16:21.481 --> 16:24.113
OR WOULD YOU PREFER SOMETHING
A LITTLE STRONGER?

16:24.114 --> 16:25.514
UH, THAT'S VERY AMUSING

16:25.515 --> 16:28.018
BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY I DRINK.
JUST WATER, THANK YOU.

16:29.459 --> 16:30.989
DO YOU SEE WHAT
LENNOX DID TO ME?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.022
SHE TOTALLY HUMILIATED ME
IN FRONT OF ALL OF OHIO.

16:33.023 --> 16:35.094
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOUR
NAME RECOGNITION IS WAY UP.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.365
I MEAN, PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

16:36.366 --> 16:39.428
YEAH, THE CRAZY
DRUNK TO VOTE FOR.

16:39.429 --> 16:42.101
SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT
YOU WERE CRAZY.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.033
WELL, SO YOU THINK ALL
OF THIS IS JUST PEACHY?

16:44.034 --> 16:45.704
WELL, IT'S NOT BAD. I MEAN,
THEY'RE PAYING US...

16:45.705 --> 16:47.406
HECK OF A LOT MORE
THAN NANNY MONEY.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.537
OH, AND CHECK THIS OUT.

16:48.538 --> 16:50.409
SOMEONE CREATED A
LITTLE FAN PAGE FOR ME.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.680
- ( phone beeps )
- LOOK AT THIS.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.582
"LADIES WHO ARE LOCO
FOR LONGO," HUH?

16:53.583 --> 16:55.414
HMM, WELL, I'M
VERY HAPPY FOR YOU

16:55.415 --> 16:57.446
AND THOSE DERANGED
MIDDLE-AGED LADIES.

16:57.447 --> 16:59.318
MEL AND JOE, MY TWO
FAVORITE GUEST HOSTS.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.449
I HAVE SOME EXCELLENT NEWS.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.421
THE REGULAR HOST...
STILL IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.592
THAT'S EXCELLENT NEWS?

17:03.593 --> 17:05.794
OH, NOT FOR HIM. THAT
FACE-LIFT DID NOT TAKE.

17:05.795 --> 17:07.726
FRANKLY HE LOOKS LIKE A PICASSO.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.699
BUT HIS BOTCHED SURGERY
IS YOUR LUCKY DAY.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.332
"GOOD MORNING TOLEDO" WANTS TO EXTEND
YOUR CONTRACT FOR THE NEXT MONTH

17:13.333 --> 17:14.703
WITH A BUMP IN PAY.

17:14.704 --> 17:18.337
REALLY? EXACTLY HOW
BIG IS THIS BUMP?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.038
BIGGER THAN MY AUNT
EILEEN'S BUTT.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.271
YOU DON'T KNOW
HER, BUT IT'S BIG.

17:22.272 --> 17:24.343
HEY, TOLEDO WANTS YOU
GUYS ON THE AIR.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.375
FOR A WHOLE MONTH? WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT?

17:26.376 --> 17:28.377
YOUR CONSTANT DISASTERS AT HOME.

17:28.378 --> 17:30.048
YOUR LACK OF PARENTING SKILLS

17:30.049 --> 17:31.480
IS VERY RELATABLE
TO OUR AUDIENCE.

17:31.481 --> 17:34.083
OKAY, SO THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANT US ON THIS SHOW

17:34.084 --> 17:35.324
IS TO EXPLOIT MY
FAMILY'S PROBLEMS

17:35.325 --> 17:36.425
FOR LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT?

17:36.426 --> 17:38.257
HOW DO I SAY THIS
WITH SENSITIVITY?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.428
YEAH.

17:39.429 --> 17:42.761
WOW, YOU MAKE
POLITICS LOOK NOBLE.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.333
YOU KNOW WHAT, KYLE?

17:44.334 --> 17:46.135
I DID THIS TO HELP
MY STATE SENATE RUN,

17:46.136 --> 17:48.768
NOT TO PUT MY FAMILY ON DISPLAY
LIKE LOBSTERS IN A TANK.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.571
LOOK, JOE, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.503
BUT I'M OUT.

17:54.504 --> 17:56.545
MEL, BUT... PLEASE. WE
CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

17:56.546 --> 17:58.348
YOU'RE ESSENTIAL TO THE SHOW!

17:59.479 --> 18:02.811
JOE, I'M GONNA PAIR
YOU WITH ASHLEY...

18:02.812 --> 18:04.483
THE NEW BACK-AND-FORTH.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.514
SHE ASKS YOU ABOUT THE KIDS.

18:05.515 --> 18:06.685
YOU GIVE US THE
GRUESOME DETAILS.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.418
HEY, YOU CAN EVEN TRASH
YOUR OLD CO-HOST.

18:09.419 --> 18:12.191
KYLE, LOOK, NORMALLY
I DISAGREE WITH MEL

18:12.192 --> 18:13.423
ON JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING, BUT UM...

18:15.094 --> 18:17.326
NOT ON THIS ONE, MAN.
I'M OUT TOO.

18:17.327 --> 18:18.767
LET ME AT LEAST TELL YOU
HOW MUCH THE BUMP IS.

18:18.768 --> 18:20.229
OKAY. NO!

18:20.230 --> 18:21.570
NO, ACTUALLY, DON'T TELL ME.

18:21.571 --> 18:23.472
IT'LL JUST MAKE ME CRY.

18:23.473 --> 18:24.873
I'M JUST GONNA GO HOME

18:24.874 --> 18:27.436
AND WHIP OUT MY COMPUTER AND...

18:27.437 --> 18:28.808
SEARCH MYSELF TO SLEEP.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.211
Ashley: My twin sister and I

18:32.212 --> 18:33.583
both stripped our way
through college.

18:34.884 --> 18:37.586
I finally got out, but
she stayed in the life.

18:37.587 --> 18:40.549
Eventually she
gained 200 pounds,

18:40.550 --> 18:41.720
but she kept stripping

18:41.721 --> 18:43.523
because it was the only
work she could get.

18:45.355 --> 18:49.258
She was a philosophy major.

18:49.259 --> 18:51.129
WOW, "GOOD MORNING TOLEDO"

18:51.130 --> 18:53.302
HAS REALLY TAKEN A
TURN TO THE TRASHY.

18:53.303 --> 18:55.164
THIS IS MINDLESS.

18:55.165 --> 18:57.167
OH MY GOD, I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

18:59.469 --> 19:01.270
- HEY, GUYS.
- Zander: HEY.

19:01.271 --> 19:02.811
SO HOW COME ASHLEY'S HOSTING?

19:02.812 --> 19:04.373
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

19:04.374 --> 19:06.745
OH... WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS...

19:06.746 --> 19:09.418
UH, THE TRUTH IS...

19:09.419 --> 19:11.220
THEY FIRED US.

19:11.221 --> 19:13.552
YEP, GAVE US THE BOOT.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.424
APPARENTLY, WE JUST WEREN'T
INTERESTING ENOUGH.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.786
OH, YOU COULDN'T JUST KEEP
DISHING DIRT ABOUT US?

19:17.787 --> 19:20.359
YEAH, NOBODY REALLY WANTED
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.231
MM-HMM. NO, THAT GOT
OLD IN A HURRY.

19:22.232 --> 19:23.292
THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH ASHLEY

19:23.293 --> 19:26.695
'CAUSE SHE IS A HOT TRAIN WRECK.

19:26.696 --> 19:28.497
HEY, I'M JUST HAPPY
NO ONE'S GONNA BE

19:28.498 --> 19:30.369
TALKING ABOUT US ON TV ANYMORE.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.401
YES, FROM NOW ON,
OUR FAMILY DRAMA

19:32.402 --> 19:34.673
WILL STAY IN THIS HOUSE
WHERE IT BELONGS.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.245
IN THAT CASE, I SHOULD
PROBABLY TAKE DOWN

19:36.246 --> 19:37.746
SOME UNFLATTERING PHOTOS OF JOE

19:37.747 --> 19:39.749
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE FOUND
THEIR WAY ONTO THE INTERNET.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.912
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.855
HEY, LOOK, ABOUT ALL
THIS STUFF THIS WEEK...

19:46.856 --> 19:48.717
DO YOU THINK WE CAN JUST
FORGIVE EACH OTHER,

19:48.718 --> 19:50.719
ERASE OUR FACEBOOK
TIMELINES, AND MOVE ON?

19:50.720 --> 19:52.921
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.363
BUT MAYBE BY TOMORROW.

19:54.364 --> 19:55.424
AND YOU KNOW, ANOTHER GIFT CARD

19:55.425 --> 19:56.865
WOULD REALLY JUST
SPEED THE HEALING.

19:56.866 --> 19:59.528
YEAH, DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.630
OKAY, WELL, JOE AND I WILL GO
IN THE KITCHEN AND MAKE OUR

20:01.631 --> 20:03.402
DYSFUNCTIONAL LITTLE
FAMILY A LOVELY DINNER.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.434
YES, AND BY "JOE AND
I," SHE MEANS JOE.

20:05.435 --> 20:06.535
YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT WAS CLEAR.

20:06.536 --> 20:07.906
OH, SO JUST LIKE "GOOD
MORNING TOLEDO,"

20:07.907 --> 20:09.278
I WILL BE CARRYING YOU AGAIN.

20:09.279 --> 20:10.539
YEAH, RIGHT. LIKE
YOU COULD CARRY

20:10.540 --> 20:11.541
ME AND THAT EGO.

20:13.343 --> 20:14.384
WAIT, LENNOX GOT A GIFT CARD?

20:19.919 --> 20:21.920
( phone rings )

20:21.921 --> 20:23.722
HELLO.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.993
YEAH, SURE. HOLD ON.

20:24.994 --> 20:26.756
IT'S ZANDER'S MOM FOR YOU.

20:27.657 --> 20:29.498
HELLO.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.430
WELL, YES, ZANDER'S HERE.
WHERE ELSE WOULD HE BE

20:31.431 --> 20:32.461
AFTER YOU KICKED HIM OUT?

20:32.462 --> 20:35.264
WELL, IS THAT RIGHT?

20:35.265 --> 20:36.765
WELL, THAT IS A VERY
DIFFERENT STORY.

20:36.766 --> 20:38.937
THANK YOU, OKAY.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.309
( phone turns off )

20:40.310 --> 20:41.411
OH, ZANDER.

20:43.773 --> 20:45.815
MAY I JUST SAY, YOU
LOOK LOVELY TONIGHT.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.817
AND MR. LONGO, THAT WAS
SUPERLATIVE CHICKEN.

20:48.818 --> 20:50.549
LIFE-CHANGING.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.751
SO YOUR MOM SAID

20:52.752 --> 20:53.952
THAT SHE DIDN'T KICK
YOU OUT AT ALL.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.954
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL
ME WHY YOU LIED TO US?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.456
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S KIND OF NICE

20:57.457 --> 20:59.688
BEING HERE WHERE LENNOX
IS ALL THE TIME.

20:59.689 --> 21:02.731
OH, ISN'T HE JUST THE CUTEST?

21:02.732 --> 21:04.363
BUT YOU SPENT EVERY
NIGHT IN MY ROOM.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.634
I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT'S THE UPSIDE?

21:05.635 --> 21:07.666
YOU GOT ME. IT DOESN'T
REALLY MAKE MUCH SENSE.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.470
OH, EXCEPT YOU GUYS ARE
GONE A LOT DURING THE DAY.

21:14.544 --> 21:15.804
ZANDER.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.676
- YEAH.
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

21:17.677 --> 21:19.508
A RUNNING START.

21:19.509 --> 21:21.381
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE IT.

21:25.455 --> 21:26.786
OH, HEY!
