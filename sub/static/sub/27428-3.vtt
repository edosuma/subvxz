00:04.484 --> 00:06.564
<i>My Cal U classmates and I were a part of</i>

00:06.601 --> 00:08.701
<i>a large generation of young people</i>

00:08.750 --> 00:11.985
<i>who were defined
by our refusal to be defined.</i>

00:12.020 --> 00:14.140
<i>We rejected gender categories...</i>

00:15.657 --> 00:17.827
<i>...we defied restrictions...</i>

00:17.890 --> 00:19.893
<i>...we fought the establishment...</i>

00:19.928 --> 00:22.128
<i>...and we reserved judgment.</i>

00:22.163 --> 00:24.064
<i>But I was starting to wonder...</i>

00:24.099 --> 00:27.366
<i>...as a generation so unwilling
to be defined or constrained</i>

00:27.402 --> 00:30.704
<i>by other people's rules,
why did we give ourselves so many?</i>

00:32.006 --> 00:33.707
<i>Take my crew, for example.</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:35.842
<i>We had a rule for everything...</i>

00:35.877 --> 00:38.277
<i>outfit check-ins
to avoid dressing alike,</i>

00:38.313 --> 00:40.847
<i>texting "Good morning"
as soon as we woke up,</i>

00:40.882 --> 00:43.683
<i>never, ever,</i> ever <i> letting</i>
<i>our phones die,</i>

00:43.708 --> 00:47.007
<i>and, of course,
group approval on all photos.</i>

00:47.032 --> 00:48.464
Guys, can we get a picture, please?

00:48.499 --> 00:50.181
- Yeah. Okay, hang on.
- Thank you.

00:50.206 --> 00:51.600
- Let me fix my hair.
- Wait, but make sure I look cute.

00:56.373 --> 00:57.739
- You gotta Facetune.
- Make me look good.

00:57.775 --> 00:59.207
Yeah, I got you.

00:59.242 --> 01:01.476
Oh, wait, guys. There is
a kickback at Hawkins.

01:01.511 --> 01:02.944
- Who's in?
- No, pass.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.444
Nothing sadder than a bunch of dudes

01:04.480 --> 01:05.881
who couldn't even score at last call.

01:05.916 --> 01:07.716
- I'm so in.
- I'm out.

01:07.751 --> 01:10.351
- We're out, too.
- Yeah, we have early track practice.

01:10.387 --> 01:12.921
I guess I'll just head back
home to Hawkins, then.

01:17.895 --> 01:21.362
<i>After</i> I take you guys back home,
like the gentleman

01:21.393 --> 01:22.890
- I was raised to be. Right.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Come on.

01:22.933 --> 01:24.833
Wait. Why is everyone being so lame?

01:24.868 --> 01:26.501
I'm down. I'm just gonna text Luca.

Hey, everyone has their
location tracking on, yeah?

01:38.280 --> 01:39.180
- Yeah.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

01:43.385 --> 01:45.219
Thank you.

01:45.254 --> 01:48.055
<i>To be clear, most of
these rules went unspoken...</i>

01:48.091 --> 01:50.557
<i>we weren't crazy.
But we all knew the drill</i>

01:50.593 --> 01:53.360
<i>and, for the most part,
acted accordingly.</i>

02:05.908 --> 02:07.041
Come on.

02:08.077 --> 02:09.943
Whoo!

02:22.491 --> 02:25.692
Damn... Doug is here without Jazz?

02:33.702 --> 02:36.236
Okay, what do I say? Am I good?

02:36.272 --> 02:37.904
Yeah, no, I-I-I'm totally good.

02:37.939 --> 02:39.906
I am goody good. I am Mr. Goodbar.

02:39.941 --> 02:42.008
In fact, I am Meagan Good
riding in a Goodyear Blimp

02:42.043 --> 02:45.345
with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Sr.
in the back bumping Goodie Mob.

02:48.950 --> 02:51.652

03:34.495 --> 03:36.595
Do I tell Jazz Doug's here?

03:36.631 --> 03:38.464
That's what a good friend
would do if her girl's dude

03:38.499 --> 03:40.933
is doing something he's not
supposed to be doing, right?

03:40.968 --> 03:44.469
Or... Or will it just start
unnecessary drama?

03:44.504 --> 03:47.105
I don't know. Damn it.

03:51.545 --> 03:53.212
I know exactly what to do...

03:55.449 --> 03:57.850
...text people
who know exactly what to do.

03:58.986 --> 04:02.943
<i>Guys, Doug is here at the kickback.
What do I do?</i>

04:02.968 --> 04:04.422
<i>He doing anything Sus?</i>

04:04.450 --> 04:07.051
<i>No, he's chill.
There's like a five-foot radius</i>

04:07.094 --> 04:10.162
<i>from any girl's ass.
But he's here and without Jazz.</i>

04:10.197 --> 04:12.497
<i>Well, he does live there.</i>

04:12.532 --> 04:14.766
<i>- Does Jazz know?
- IDK.</i>

04:14.801 --> 04:16.634
<i>That's why I'm texting you guys.</i>

04:16.670 --> 04:18.636
<i>- You should tell her.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</i>

04:18.672 --> 04:20.973
<i>But he isn't doing anything wrong.</i>

04:21.007 --> 04:22.507
<i>I don't want to start dramz.</i>

04:22.542 --> 04:24.476
<i>He's breaking the co-ed kickback rule.</i>

04:24.511 --> 04:27.846
<i>- Isn't that wrong?
- That's their rule, not the rule.</i>

04:27.881 --> 04:32.316
<i>If it's Jazz's rule, that makes
it your rule by proxy.</i>

04:36.956 --> 04:39.156
<i>He just said "'sup" to me.</i>

04:39.192 --> 04:41.292
<i>Doesn't sound like guilty behavior,</i>

04:41.327 --> 04:43.294
<i>but I'm gonna need eyes on this.</i>

04:43.329 --> 04:45.029
<i>Ugh, hold on.</i>

04:53.407 --> 04:56.441
<i>Well, see? He's not talking
to any girls or anything.</i>

04:56.476 --> 04:58.510
<i>But he's also still wearing his chain,</i>

04:58.545 --> 05:01.212
<i>which means he's not going
to sleep anytime soon.</i>

05:01.247 --> 05:03.280
<i>Maybe it's his sleep chain.</i>

05:05.418 --> 05:07.384
<i>Guys, come on. My battery's low.</i>

05:10.489 --> 05:11.822
Hey, dude, you got a charger?

05:11.857 --> 05:13.457
Not now, Zoey. I'm working.

05:13.492 --> 05:15.626
So, like I was saying,
I just really think Ja Rule

05:15.661 --> 05:17.461
and the Fyre Festival
deserve a second shot...

05:17.496 --> 05:19.396
Yo, good to see you, bro.

05:19.432 --> 05:22.800
<i>Oh, wait. Doug just got up.</i>

05:22.835 --> 05:24.468
<i>Maybe he's leaving.</i>

05:24.503 --> 05:26.036
<i>Please, God, let him be leaving.</i>

05:26.071 --> 05:27.304
<i>If he leaves, then this definitely</i>

05:27.339 --> 05:28.672
<i>stops being my problem.</i>

05:28.707 --> 05:30.474
<i>Does it, though?</i>

05:30.509 --> 05:31.608
Yes.

05:31.644 --> 05:33.544
Yo, I'll be right back.

05:33.579 --> 05:36.713
- No.
- No, don't do it. Don't do it.

05:36.749 --> 05:39.316
<i>FML. He's actually taking shots.</i>

05:39.351 --> 05:41.485
<i>He's turning up the turn up.</i>

05:41.520 --> 05:43.519
<i>Dude, my phone's about to die,</i>

05:43.555 --> 05:45.655
<i>and I still don't know
whether to tell Jazz.</i>

05:45.690 --> 05:47.523
<i>What do I do?</i>

05:50.328 --> 05:53.262
No.

05:53.297 --> 05:55.331
And Luca. Shoot.

06:07.712 --> 06:09.445
Excuse me.

06:09.481 --> 06:11.080
Sorry to interrupt, but we
received a noise complaint.

06:11.115 --> 06:12.808
Yes, who's in charge here?

06:12.833 --> 06:16.352
That would be me.
I am the R.A. on duty, my brothas.

06:16.387 --> 06:18.955
I want to say sorry about
the noise, Officers. Honestly.

06:18.990 --> 06:21.824
Uh, see, Hawkins
is the black dorm on campus,

06:21.860 --> 06:24.527
so we decided to spend our,
uh, evening fraternizing

06:24.562 --> 06:25.794
with our fellow black students,

06:25.829 --> 06:28.330
celebrating our black
excellence, you know?

06:28.366 --> 06:30.232
We do it for the culture.

06:30.267 --> 06:31.467
- Hey.
- My dudes!

06:31.502 --> 06:33.535
- Doin' it for the culture.
- Got to respect that.

06:33.570 --> 06:35.837
Thanks, guys.
You know, um, blue lives mat...

06:35.873 --> 06:37.839
Whoa, whoa, no.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.641
But we do want
to thank you, guys, honestly,

06:39.676 --> 06:41.877
- for being so cool about this.
- No doubt.

06:41.912 --> 06:43.912
We just wanted to congratulate you guys

06:43.947 --> 06:46.248
- on your dope-ass turn up.
- Mm.

06:46.283 --> 06:48.717
And give you this dope-ass
ticket for the noise violation.

06:48.752 --> 06:50.685
Go on and take it, yep.
You'll need to appear

06:50.721 --> 06:53.055
before the dean in
the morning, my brotha.

06:53.090 --> 06:55.557
- Wait, what?
- Carry on... quietly.

06:55.592 --> 06:56.925
What...

06:56.960 --> 06:58.427
But the culture.

06:58.462 --> 07:00.362
So I screwed up, and I let my phone die,

07:00.398 --> 07:02.197
but everything is gonna be fine.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.965
Luca is an understanding guy.

07:04.001 --> 07:05.501
I'll just explain what happened,

07:05.536 --> 07:07.035
and we'll spend the rest
of the night making love

07:07.070 --> 07:08.436
like one of us is dying.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.038
Okay.

07:14.745 --> 07:16.611
Dude. Seriously?

07:16.647 --> 07:18.847
Or he'll say, "Dude. Seriously?"

07:18.882 --> 07:21.917
Luca, I am so sorry. My phone just died.

07:21.952 --> 07:24.252
You hate when <i> my</i> phone dies.
But it's cool.

07:24.287 --> 07:26.755
No, it was just...
I-I was texting Ana and Nomi

07:26.790 --> 07:30.025
about the whole Doug-and-Jazz
situation, and...

07:30.060 --> 07:31.860
- Oh, so your phone didn't die.
- No, it did, like,

07:31.895 --> 07:33.929
right in the middle of all of the drama.

07:33.964 --> 07:35.129
And I-I saw your text.

07:35.165 --> 07:37.365
It was just, like,
so much was happening.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.768
So you saw my text, read it,
and then ignored it.

07:39.803 --> 07:42.370
No, no. Like, I-I swiped up
and dismissed them

07:42.405 --> 07:43.972
'cause I-I wasn't even
thinking about it like that.

07:44.007 --> 07:46.140
So you dismissed them
and didn't think about it?

07:46.176 --> 07:47.742
- Hot.
- No, that's not what I mean.

07:47.778 --> 07:49.142
You know that's not what I mean.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.745
Luca, why are you being
so extra right now?

07:51.781 --> 07:54.915
I'm here, and you have
my undivided attention.

07:56.251 --> 07:58.318
That probably wasn't important.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.387
That either.

08:00.422 --> 08:02.422
Or that one.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.491
That wasn't important.
Not as important as thi...

08:04.526 --> 08:06.493
I should just check.
I should just check.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.628
Just... Let me just check.

08:09.264 --> 08:11.565
- What the hell?
- You know what?

08:11.601 --> 08:14.568
You are being mad extra
right now. Do you.

08:14.604 --> 08:16.236
I'm gonna watch "The Price is
Right" with headphones.

08:16.271 --> 08:19.339
Babe, just wait like one sec.

08:27.355 --> 08:29.659
Great, so not only is Luca pissed at me,

08:29.691 --> 08:32.065
but apparently in the 20 minutes
my phone went dark,

08:32.152 --> 08:34.159
all hell broke loose with my girls.

08:34.712 --> 08:38.431
<i>Zoeyyy... hello? Did you decide
what you're gonna do?</i>

08:38.485 --> 08:40.900
<i>Yeah, you don't wanna piss Jazz off.</i>

08:40.985 --> 08:42.727
<i>Piss Jazz off about what?</i>

08:42.789 --> 08:46.461
<i>Um, can y'all stop lighting me up?
I'm trying to sleep.</i>

08:46.508 --> 08:48.698
Ana! You replied to
the wrong group text!

08:48.737 --> 08:50.056
- No, no.
- What?

08:50.081 --> 08:51.860
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:54.849 --> 08:56.681
What the hell, Ana?

08:56.717 --> 08:59.484
- Is this your first time texting?
- I don't know, Zoey.

08:59.519 --> 09:01.778
Is this your first time
doing some snake-ass shit?

09:01.803 --> 09:04.108
Ooh, hey, girl, hey.

09:04.147 --> 09:06.258
Nah, Zoey. I want an explanation.

09:06.293 --> 09:08.593
You know, I don't know, and I-I'm sorry.

09:08.629 --> 09:10.863
I-I didn't know what to do,
and, technically,

09:10.898 --> 09:13.025
it didn't seem like Doug
was doing anything wrong.

09:13.067 --> 09:15.234
So I didn't want to start
unnecessary drama.

09:15.269 --> 09:16.834
You don't think going behind my back,

09:16.870 --> 09:19.137
texting about me
for 42 minutes is drama?

09:19.172 --> 09:20.371
You know, in my defense,

09:20.406 --> 09:23.040
42 minutes sounds like
a gross exaggeration...

09:23.076 --> 09:24.441
It's actually extremely accurate.

09:24.477 --> 09:26.778
Nomi sent me a screenshot.

09:32.718 --> 09:34.952
So, Nomi sent a-a screenshot
of our... our group chat,

09:34.988 --> 09:38.522
which was private,
which should've included Jazz.

09:38.557 --> 09:40.724
So thank you for forwarding that along.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.593
All right, I was just
trying to clarify things

09:42.628 --> 09:45.396
- after Ana's dumb mistake.
- Uh, no, you weren't.

09:45.431 --> 09:47.398
You were just trying to cover your ass

09:47.433 --> 09:50.067
while kissing Jazz's
because you're scared of her.

09:50.103 --> 09:51.735
- Yeah, there. I said it.
- Pbht!

09:51.771 --> 09:53.804
- Your secret's out.
- Why the hell are you scared of me?

09:55.441 --> 09:57.574
I don't think we should be
making this about me,

09:57.610 --> 09:59.777
because Zoey is the one
who started this whole thing.

09:59.812 --> 10:01.378
Zoey pulled us all into it.

10:01.414 --> 10:03.880
So, everyone, let's focus
our attention on Zoey.

10:03.905 --> 10:05.204
- Zoey Johnson.
- No, no, no.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.618
'Cause this is not just about her.

10:06.619 --> 10:08.251
You guys are supposed to be my girls,

10:08.287 --> 10:10.153
and you all are supposed
to have my back.

10:10.189 --> 10:11.922
How many other group-text thingies

10:11.957 --> 10:13.290
do you have going on about me?

10:13.326 --> 10:15.559
Jazlyn, don't play the victim here.

10:15.594 --> 10:18.295
Don't act like you didn't start
a text about Zoey the other day.

10:18.323 --> 10:20.989
- Wait, what?
- Okay, so now we're just blasting people

10:21.033 --> 10:23.233
- for blast's sake?
- Hold on. What was being said about Zoey?

10:23.268 --> 10:24.635
That you're too damn smiley.

10:24.670 --> 10:26.136
You're always walking around,
teeth all out.

10:26.171 --> 10:27.838
Ain't nothing in the world
that [bleep] funny.

10:27.873 --> 10:29.272
That's pretty funny.

10:29.308 --> 10:31.308
There you go again, kissing Jazz's ass,

10:31.343 --> 10:33.609
- you little kiss-ass.
- All right, bitch, learn how to text.

10:33.645 --> 10:35.578
Bitch, don't be sending
screenshots like that.

10:35.613 --> 10:37.513
- It was one screenshot.
- Why are we arguing with each other?

10:37.549 --> 10:39.749
Exactly. You started all of this.

10:39.784 --> 10:40.783
This is ridiculous.

10:40.819 --> 10:42.185
If you're gonna be mad at anyone,

10:42.221 --> 10:43.686
be mad at Doug.

10:43.722 --> 10:46.522
Why would I be mad at Doug?
He didn't do anything wrong.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.191
He lives there.

10:48.227 --> 10:50.026
But he was... But <i> I</i> did?

10:50.062 --> 10:51.094
Yes.

10:52.630 --> 10:55.999
Okay, I'm done. These people are insane.

10:56.034 --> 10:58.201
I'm friends with insane people.

11:05.677 --> 11:08.010
<i>I couldn't figure out how one kickback</i>

11:08.045 --> 11:10.446
<i>had exploded into such a disaster.</i>

11:10.482 --> 11:12.615
<i>Everyone was pissed at each other</i>

11:12.650 --> 11:14.350
<i>and especially at me.</i>

11:14.386 --> 11:16.886
<i>And I had no idea how to fix it.</i>

11:16.921 --> 11:19.989
<i>So I slapped some white strips
on my big, happy teeth</i>

11:20.024 --> 11:22.692
<i>and I tried to just go to sleep
and forget about it.</i>

11:25.263 --> 11:26.962
<i>Obviously, that plan failed.</i>

11:29.333 --> 11:31.834
They say "Never go to sleep angry,"

11:31.870 --> 11:35.838
but what happens if you
just never go to sleep?

11:48.519 --> 11:50.920
Not one "Good morning" text.

11:50.955 --> 11:56.591
Not even from Luca.
Or an accidental nude from Ana.

11:56.627 --> 11:59.228
This is worse than I thought.

11:59.263 --> 12:00.595
All right, you know what?

12:02.033 --> 12:04.433
This just means that I, Zoey Johnson,

12:04.468 --> 12:06.468
have to be the bigger person.

12:08.415 --> 12:10.141
<i>Good morning?</i>

12:12.910 --> 12:16.010
I'll just give them a... a minute.

12:16.046 --> 12:17.011
Yeah.

12:32.930 --> 12:34.429
What's happening?

12:34.465 --> 12:36.865
I'm actually starting
to freak out right now.

12:38.435 --> 12:41.436
Yes, but, Dean Telphy, is
a ticket completely necessary?

12:41.472 --> 12:42.704
We're in college.

12:42.739 --> 12:44.172
Students are bound
to turn up from time to time.

12:44.207 --> 12:45.340
I'm aware of that,

12:45.375 --> 12:47.307
and I've been doing
my research on you kids.

12:47.343 --> 12:49.376
Been reading a lot of
young-adult material...

12:49.411 --> 12:52.947
Y.A. is a genre of literature,
not a rapper.

12:52.982 --> 12:54.482
Common mistake.

12:54.517 --> 12:56.851
And according to the entire
"Sweet Valley Twins" series

12:56.886 --> 12:59.086
with the obvious exception of volume 14,

12:59.121 --> 13:01.337
we can all agree that your body's

13:01.384 --> 13:02.422
going through some changes.

13:02.458 --> 13:05.092
That is 100% false, so...

13:05.127 --> 13:08.529
As a resident adviser and
a representative of Cal U,

13:08.564 --> 13:10.798
I have to hold you to a higher standard.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.566
Hold up. "A representative of Cal U"?

13:12.602 --> 13:15.369
I signed up to be an R.A. to get
a break on my housing, man.

13:15.404 --> 13:17.872
Yeah, sure, I figured I'd
have to replace a few keys,

13:17.907 --> 13:19.806
maybe talk a Nigerian kid down
from his first high,

13:19.841 --> 13:22.041
but I did not sign... What are you...

13:22.076 --> 13:24.410
I just didn't sign up to be
a Cal U representative, okay?

13:24.445 --> 13:27.413
In addition to housing,
you also get a food plan,

13:27.448 --> 13:30.316
priority class registration,
and a small stipend.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.085
Yes, a very small one compared
to the amount of work that I do.

13:33.121 --> 13:36.890
I am the R.A., the therapist,
the janitor, the landlord.

13:36.925 --> 13:38.725
You know, what's next, sharecropping?

13:38.760 --> 13:41.594
This isn't about
your farming aspirations.

13:41.630 --> 13:43.429
I constantly get complaints
from employees

13:43.464 --> 13:45.498
telling me that they're
overworked and underpaid,

13:45.534 --> 13:46.766
but at the end of the day,

13:46.801 --> 13:48.134
everyone has to play their position.

13:48.169 --> 13:50.202
So play your position or you're out!

13:54.474 --> 13:56.408
Did you... You felt that?

13:56.443 --> 13:58.977
That was my first time
being authoritative like that,

13:59.013 --> 14:00.679
'cause I... I'm usually happy and not...

14:00.714 --> 14:02.180
You know, I stay lit all the time.

14:02.215 --> 14:04.182
So I don't, you know,
just be mad like that,

14:04.217 --> 14:05.450
but did you feel that?

14:05.485 --> 14:07.218
I just... Can I go home?

14:08.689 --> 14:10.923
<i>So, not only had no one responded</i>

14:10.958 --> 14:12.991
<i>to my "Good morning" texts...</i>

14:13.027 --> 14:14.459
What?!

14:14.494 --> 14:16.294
<i>...but they'd all also apparently</i>

14:16.329 --> 14:18.129
<i>logged off of location tracking.</i>

14:18.165 --> 14:19.598
Oh, my God.

14:19.633 --> 14:21.867
I am legit stressing out now.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.936
We're at DEFCON 1.

14:27.207 --> 14:30.675
Oh, Sky, thank God, a sane person.

14:30.710 --> 14:32.477
Can you believe all this drama?

14:32.512 --> 14:34.679
Everyone's acting,
like, completely crazy.

14:34.714 --> 14:36.381
Um, what are you doing?

14:37.684 --> 14:40.285
- Talking to you.
- Zoey, I find it strange

14:40.320 --> 14:42.620
that I even have to explain this to you.

14:42.655 --> 14:45.457
If Jazz is pissed at you,
I'm pissed at you.

14:45.492 --> 14:47.024
- Mm.
- There's a hierarchy.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.826
Chicks before dicks,

14:48.861 --> 14:51.529
depending on the dick,
and family over everything.

14:51.565 --> 14:54.332
But Jazz has no good reason
to be pissed at me.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.167
- I made a mistake.
- Doesn't matter.

14:56.203 --> 14:58.168
I actually don't even know
what all this craziness

14:58.204 --> 14:59.636
- is about, so...
- What?

14:59.671 --> 15:02.005
So you're mad at me
a-and don't even know why?

15:02.040 --> 15:03.373
I don't need to know why.

15:03.409 --> 15:05.509
Squeeze first, ask questions last.

15:05.544 --> 15:07.711
You know what it is, Zoey.

15:07.746 --> 15:11.180
I definitely do not "know what it is."

15:11.216 --> 15:12.716
Well, I just...

15:12.751 --> 15:15.151
Okay, just gonna...

15:15.186 --> 15:16.452
Great.

15:30.201 --> 15:32.736
You know what? I'm making
a new rule for myself:

15:32.771 --> 15:35.805
I don't have to deal with this crap.

15:37.242 --> 15:40.744
So they want to ice me out
for not following their rules.

15:40.779 --> 15:42.310
Well, screw that.

15:42.346 --> 15:44.146
Zoey Johnson doesn't get iced out.

15:44.181 --> 15:46.882
I do the icing, and I am sick of living

15:46.917 --> 15:48.550
by their random, arbitrary,

15:48.585 --> 15:51.854
applying-to-some-but-not-all,
stressful A.F. rules.

15:51.889 --> 15:54.256
<i>I was done with the location tracking,</i>

15:54.291 --> 15:56.291
<i>the group texts, the social media,</i>

15:56.326 --> 15:58.460
<i>FaceTuning Ana's butt, all of it.</i>

15:58.495 --> 16:00.228
<i>I didn't need anybody.</i>

16:01.666 --> 16:05.067
Hey, Luca. Hi. Yeah.
Thanks for... Hello?

16:05.102 --> 16:07.102
Hello? No.

16:07.138 --> 16:09.638
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:09.674 --> 16:11.439
Not again. Not again.

16:11.475 --> 16:12.874
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

16:12.909 --> 16:14.976
Does anybody have a charger, by chance?

16:15.011 --> 16:16.544
Anybody? Sir, do you have a charger?

16:16.579 --> 16:17.945
Mnh-mnh.

16:17.981 --> 16:20.197
- Ma'am, I will pay you for a charger.
- No, no.

16:20.222 --> 16:21.083
Please.

16:21.084 --> 16:23.751
No.

16:23.787 --> 16:26.087
Does anyone have a charger?

16:28.424 --> 16:30.257
No. What's happening?

16:30.293 --> 16:31.793
Oh, God... I can't breathe...

16:35.165 --> 16:38.132
I don't wanna die in
a shorts/boots combo.

16:43.124 --> 16:46.085
So, the good news is

16:46.148 --> 16:48.241
your girl only had a panic attack.

16:48.296 --> 16:50.819
The bad news is...
there's a 9 in 10 chance

16:50.913 --> 16:53.647
everyone at Cal U has HPV.

16:53.701 --> 16:57.336
Uh, Zoey, your identical
twin brother is here.

16:57.371 --> 17:00.324
Oh, hey.

17:00.349 --> 17:02.620
What you doing here?

17:02.644 --> 17:04.183
Well, you went ghost again,

17:04.208 --> 17:06.034
so I kind of used
your location to track you.

17:06.054 --> 17:08.054
- So you're stalking me.
- Chill.

17:08.089 --> 17:09.556
I mean, your phone hung up

17:09.590 --> 17:10.824
and you weren't answering my texts,

17:10.858 --> 17:12.459
- so I knew something was wrong.
- Hmm.

17:12.493 --> 17:14.446
'Cause, obviously, your phone
wouldn't just die again.

17:14.472 --> 17:17.763
- That would be crazy.
- Actually, my phone did die again.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.133
I'm sorry. I've just been really sucking

17:20.167 --> 17:23.337
at everything as of late...
an irresponsible phone owner,

17:23.372 --> 17:25.030
a bad girlfriend,

17:25.085 --> 17:27.491
a really, really shitty friend...

17:27.530 --> 17:29.170
Oh, God, I feel it happening again.

17:29.195 --> 17:30.762
- What's happening again?
- Panic attack.

17:30.814 --> 17:33.247
The doctor said they're really common.

17:33.282 --> 17:35.115
Everyone's doing it. New wave.

17:35.151 --> 17:36.684
Yeah, you wanna tell me what happened?

17:36.719 --> 17:39.253
Well, just been really overwhelmed,

17:39.288 --> 17:41.689
and everybody's mad at me.

17:41.724 --> 17:43.257
I just don't get it.

17:43.292 --> 17:45.392
You know, we want to act like
we're all free and liberated,

17:45.428 --> 17:48.896
but we have all of these rules
about everything

17:48.932 --> 17:51.398
and I can't keep up, you know?

17:51.434 --> 17:54.836
It's putting me in the...
the literal health center.

17:54.871 --> 17:56.471
These rules are driving me crazy,

17:56.506 --> 17:58.739
and I just don't know why
we do it to ourselves.

17:58.775 --> 18:00.741
I mean, sometimes people use rules

18:00.777 --> 18:02.276
to feel like they're in control.

18:02.311 --> 18:04.512
But we <i> are</i> in control.

18:04.547 --> 18:06.246
I mean, are we?

18:06.282 --> 18:08.449
'Cause last night when you
were at your boy's kickback

18:08.484 --> 18:09.816
and I couldn't get ahold of you...

18:09.852 --> 18:12.619
I low-key didn't feel in control, so...

18:12.654 --> 18:15.622
Wait, is that why you were mad
about the whole phone thing?

18:15.657 --> 18:19.093
Because of, uh, Aaron?

18:19.128 --> 18:23.263
I mean... whatever,
it's probably just stupid.

18:23.299 --> 18:25.632
I'm just... I'm just happy
you feel better, you know?

18:25.667 --> 18:28.035
Thank you. I feel better.

18:28.070 --> 18:29.870
- Hope so.
- Hmm?

18:29.905 --> 18:32.039
Now, um... I'll be, uh...

18:32.074 --> 18:34.341
I have no reflexes in that knee.

18:34.377 --> 18:35.976
No, no, your knee's broken.

18:42.183 --> 18:44.884
<i>So I thought about what Luca said.</i>

18:44.919 --> 18:46.652
<i>Giving ourselves all these rules</i>

18:46.687 --> 18:49.055
<i>wasn't about trying to
control someone else.</i>

18:49.090 --> 18:52.525
<i>It was about managing our
own fears and insecurities,</i>

18:52.560 --> 18:54.860
<i>and it made a lot of sense.</i>

18:54.896 --> 18:57.030
<i>My failure to tell Jazz about Doug</i>

18:57.065 --> 18:58.931
<i>had tapped into her insecurity,</i>

18:58.966 --> 19:01.234
<i>a friend not having her back.</i>

19:01.269 --> 19:03.969
<i>So I decided to reach out and apologize</i>

19:04.005 --> 19:05.938
<i>the way a real friend should.</i>

19:10.145 --> 19:12.545
<i>And in the interest
of not breaking another rule,</i>

19:12.580 --> 19:15.980
<i>this text was gonna include everyone.</i>

19:16.016 --> 19:18.783
<i>Hey, guys, this is a blanket apology</i>

19:18.818 --> 19:21.153
<i>for the mess I seem to
have gotten us all into.</i>

19:21.188 --> 19:23.555
<i>I really am sorry.</i>

19:23.590 --> 19:25.590
<i>And going forward, I can't promise</i>

19:25.625 --> 19:27.825
<i>I'll perfectly follow
each and every rule,</i>

19:27.861 --> 19:30.929
<i>but I can promise to try
and be a better friend.</i>

19:30.964 --> 19:34.766
<i>And maybe eventually we can
stop leaning on all these rules</i>

19:34.801 --> 19:37.169
<i>and start putting our trust
in each other.</i>

19:41.641 --> 19:44.609
<i>Love you, Zo.</i>

19:44.644 --> 19:47.112
<i>I'm sorry, too. XO.</i>

19:47.147 --> 19:50.814
<i>I'm trying to take a nap.</i>

19:50.849 --> 19:52.516
<i>Ooh, sorry.</i>

19:53.986 --> 19:56.087
<i>Jazz, you alive?</i>

20:09.952 --> 20:11.639
Thank you very much. Have a nice time.

20:11.687 --> 20:13.261
Right this way, man.

20:13.286 --> 20:15.473
- Oh, uh, definitely free for you, ladies.
- Thank you.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.598
You can just go right in.

20:16.623 --> 20:19.182
Definitely gonna need $10 each.
Thank you.

20:19.217 --> 20:21.451
You guys have a good time.
Drinks are extra.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.453
Over there.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.789
Savage, bro. You know
comping girls is all I got.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.958
Dude, I'm trying to make this
money. What are you doing?

20:27.993 --> 20:29.692
Here we go. Watch this.

20:30.861 --> 20:33.796
What's going on, my brotha?
Good to see you.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.898
Oh, you want me... All right.

20:38.169 --> 20:39.735
Good doin' business with you, my bro.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.670
Hey, we are all just trying
to play our positions.

20:41.706 --> 20:42.705
Am I right?

20:42.740 --> 20:44.807
Hey. For the culture.

20:44.842 --> 20:46.699
Yeah, for the culture.
That's what it is.
