02:17.511 --> 02:18.943
Sir, are you okay?

02:18.945 --> 02:20.245
Sir? Sir?

03:37.158 --> 03:41.026
We got 'em on the run!
Forward, boys!

03:57.644 --> 04:00.581
Captain, come on,
you got to eat.

04:18.964 --> 04:21.000
Good work out there,
gentlemen.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.555
They told me either
Hawaii or Guam.

04:43.557 --> 04:45.124
I'm ready to go to Hawaii.

04:45.126 --> 04:47.492
That's where all the
opportunity will be.

04:47.494 --> 04:48.827
What about you, Captain?

04:48.829 --> 04:51.097
I bet you got
the sweetest deals.

05:17.925 --> 05:21.293
Gentlemen, just because I pray
doesn't mean you have to.

05:21.295 --> 05:23.362
No, it's... it's good.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.398
I prayed like a little bitch
out in the field.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.199
Whoops, sorry Lord.

05:30.271 --> 05:31.370
Hey, Haas?

05:31.372 --> 05:33.370
Hmm?

05:33.372 --> 05:35.108
Who are those guys?

05:35.110 --> 05:37.875
Colonel just let them
out of the brig.

05:37.877 --> 05:40.245
They went AWOL during Normandy.

05:40.247 --> 05:41.545
Tried to go AWOL.

05:41.547 --> 05:44.315
They didn't even
make it a mile.

05:44.317 --> 05:47.151
Hey, a lot of men
were scared out there.

05:47.153 --> 05:49.954
Fear makes you do
a lot of things,

05:49.956 --> 05:52.257
things you didn't
think were possible.

05:52.259 --> 05:55.994
Yeah, lots of men died
out there on the beach,

05:55.996 --> 05:57.862
probably more than needed
to with guys running away

05:57.864 --> 06:00.264
from the action instead of
helping their fellow man.

06:00.266 --> 06:01.632
Are you talking
to somebody in particular?

06:01.634 --> 06:03.201
Oh, you're damn right I am.

06:03.203 --> 06:07.775
Hey, Private, everyone's
on edge right now.

06:09.408 --> 06:13.547
Nah, I don't got
a damn thing to say to you.

06:21.989 --> 06:24.788
That's right, run away,
run away.

06:24.790 --> 06:28.994
AWOL or not, those men
know how to handle a gun.

06:28.996 --> 06:31.829
Does make me wonder why they
ran away in the first place.

06:31.831 --> 06:34.632
Well, Colonel wants them
to redeem themselves,

06:34.634 --> 06:36.167
so, and he believes
they're good men.

06:36.169 --> 06:37.668
He's giving them
a second chance

06:37.670 --> 06:40.170
'cause we're almost out of men.

06:40.172 --> 06:42.841
Well, if they decide
to turn yellow and run,

06:42.843 --> 06:45.310
Cap'll stop them.

06:45.312 --> 06:47.112
Why would I keep them in line?

06:47.114 --> 06:49.113
They're not assigned to me.

06:49.115 --> 06:53.218
Now that Normandy's secure,
what is the next assignment?

06:53.220 --> 06:57.456
You're coming with us,
right, Captain?

06:57.458 --> 07:00.925
That's why I volunteered.
This is your squad, right?

07:00.927 --> 07:04.661
That's what Colonel told us.

07:04.663 --> 07:06.764
Isn't that what he told you?

07:06.766 --> 07:08.901
Well, look,
I'm sorry I didn't

07:08.903 --> 07:10.836
talk with you
about this earlier

07:10.838 --> 07:15.173
or, to be quite honest, even
ask you, but as we know,

07:15.175 --> 07:19.410
wartime doesn't allow for
the formalities, you know.

07:19.412 --> 07:21.745
So I take it I'm not going
back to Washington yet?

07:21.747 --> 07:23.148
Look, first of all,

07:23.150 --> 07:25.050
look, I heard what
you did on the beach,

07:25.052 --> 07:28.353
and it make me glad to hear
that I have a man

07:28.355 --> 07:30.454
who's not afraid
to kick these guys in the nuts

07:30.456 --> 07:32.923
one-on-one, okay?

07:32.925 --> 07:37.629
And look, is it true

07:37.631 --> 07:40.300
you killed a Nazi
with your bare hands?

07:41.869 --> 07:44.269
The most effective weapon
at the time, Sir.

07:50.174 --> 07:50.777
I'm taking you off the field.

07:52.912 --> 07:54.778
So I am going home?

07:54.780 --> 07:57.783
You want to go home?

07:57.785 --> 07:59.718
I go where I'm needed, Sir.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.088
After you.

08:05.826 --> 08:08.059
Right there.

08:08.061 --> 08:12.199
So look, I'm not ready
to send you back home.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.803
Not yet, not without her.

08:18.437 --> 08:21.372
She's Dr. India Eris,
a British scientist.

08:21.374 --> 08:23.975
She was doing research
in Belgium when the Nazis

08:23.977 --> 08:25.976
took her hostage
two months ago.

08:25.978 --> 08:28.379
- What type of research?
- Unknown.

08:28.381 --> 08:30.048
She was working with the
British government on some kind

08:30.050 --> 08:31.483
of biological warfare method

08:31.485 --> 08:32.817
or some sophisticated
crap like that.

08:32.818 --> 08:34.351
I don't know.

08:34.352 --> 08:37.789
Biological warfare,
like black plague?

08:37.791 --> 08:41.192
Oh come on, biological
warfare has its place.

08:41.193 --> 08:42.594
It's not as scary
as it sounds.

08:44.264 --> 08:46.398
I'll take a gun over some
lab experiment any day.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.134
Spoken like
my kind of American.

08:50.136 --> 08:51.168
Cigar?

08:51.170 --> 08:54.038
I'm fine, thank you, Sir.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.841
That was her lab
in Belgium.

08:55.843 --> 08:58.475
Now apparently, she was able
to burn down all her research

08:58.477 --> 08:59.945
before the Nazis took her.

08:59.947 --> 09:01.879
So they don't have her files,

09:01.881 --> 09:05.484
but they have
the next best thing.

09:05.486 --> 09:08.352
Her.

09:08.354 --> 09:11.389
Sir, two months is a long time.
She could be anywhere.

09:11.391 --> 09:12.957
Negative.

09:12.959 --> 09:15.360
British intelligence spotted
her at a refugee camp

09:15.362 --> 09:16.861
in Romania on a scout.

09:16.863 --> 09:19.230
Now apparently she was
under great duress,

09:19.232 --> 09:23.701
and it appears that she's
working now for the Nazi regime.

09:23.703 --> 09:26.169
Sir, you know, as I well know,
that nobody can make you do

09:26.171 --> 09:27.905
anything you
don't want to do.

09:29.708 --> 09:32.543
Well, if that was the case,
why, half of the men in my unit

09:32.545 --> 09:34.144
wouldn't be doing
what I tell them to do

09:34.146 --> 09:35.346
every day,
now, would they?

09:35.348 --> 09:37.117
What's this got to do with me?

09:39.852 --> 09:42.888
Miss Eris is
an invaluable asset.

09:42.890 --> 09:45.691
Now, we need her back
on the Allied side.

09:45.693 --> 09:48.058
Yeah, but she's British,
why don't they go find her?

09:48.060 --> 09:52.496
They tried twice.

09:52.498 --> 09:56.201
We tried twice.

09:56.203 --> 09:57.436
And?

09:57.438 --> 09:59.638
The British and U.S.
units went missing.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.206
They went missing.

10:01.208 --> 10:05.176
Now look, something's
happening in Romania,

10:05.178 --> 10:07.177
but we can't put
enough boots on the ground

10:07.179 --> 10:09.181
to send in
a full unit of men.

10:09.183 --> 10:12.182
I'm an Army Captain, Sir.
I'm not Special Forces.

10:12.184 --> 10:14.385
I'm not trained for
cloak-and-dagger missions.

10:14.387 --> 10:16.288
Okay, look, intelligence says
there's a base near there

10:16.290 --> 10:18.155
where the Nazis
are operating from.

10:18.157 --> 10:20.490
My guess, it's within
a five-mile perimeter

10:20.492 --> 10:22.027
of the village.

10:22.029 --> 10:24.296
Now just start to scout there.

10:24.298 --> 10:26.130
But I want you to be aware,

10:26.132 --> 10:28.634
these locals are hostile
to Americans.

10:28.636 --> 10:32.870
Sir, with all due respect,

10:32.872 --> 10:37.042
I'm not the right
man for the job.

10:37.044 --> 10:42.113
With all due respect,
yes, you are.

10:42.115 --> 10:44.316
Look, all of our other
resources are in Germany,

10:44.318 --> 10:46.116
China and Japan.

10:46.118 --> 10:48.385
I think the Nazis
know that, okay.

10:48.387 --> 10:50.889
They don't think we're paying
any attention to Romania,

10:50.891 --> 10:55.092
and that's why we're going to
go and take advantage of that.

10:55.094 --> 10:57.361
Sir, since you assigned
me this operation,

10:57.363 --> 10:59.730
I'm assuming you assigned
me my squad, as well?

10:59.732 --> 11:01.865
It's no one you wouldn't
have selected yourself.

11:01.867 --> 11:05.703
You got Lieutenant Haas,
uh, plus Grey,

11:05.705 --> 11:08.907
Thompson, Brisco and any
other jokers you might want.

11:08.909 --> 11:11.142
Including those guys
that went AWOL.

11:11.144 --> 11:13.144
Hey, look, the mission
will give them a chance

11:13.146 --> 11:14.645
to win their spines back

11:14.647 --> 11:18.015
because I don't send
cowards home, all right?

11:18.017 --> 11:21.452
You bring that
doctor back to me,

11:21.454 --> 11:27.227
I will be sure that the
president himself thanks you.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.570
You can shake
my hand now, Sir.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.871
I'm in.

11:40.873 --> 11:43.376
Thank you.

12:01.495 --> 12:04.162
Coffee, Captain?

12:04.164 --> 12:06.496
Where'd you get
the fresh coffee?

12:06.498 --> 12:07.934
I didn't.

12:11.703 --> 12:14.938
So how close are we?

12:14.940 --> 12:17.477
Should be coming up on the
village in a few more paces.

12:20.213 --> 12:22.348
There's something
blocking the road ahead.

12:27.319 --> 12:30.120
Looks like some
fallen branches.

12:30.122 --> 12:31.992
Let's go.

12:42.702 --> 12:45.937
So, uh, this broad's
just gonna be waiting for us

12:45.939 --> 12:47.504
with open arms
to come save her?

12:47.506 --> 12:50.008
This isn't a Flash Gordon
serial, Grey.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.710
Eh, screw that.

12:51.712 --> 12:53.677
They're gonna be making movies
about me when I get home.

12:53.679 --> 12:56.014
Is that so?

12:56.016 --> 12:59.183
So-di-so-so, Mr. Thompson.

12:59.185 --> 13:03.921
Grey, who's gonna play you,
Ginger Rogers?

13:03.923 --> 13:05.456
My uncle's a publisher.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.292
He's gonna wait for us
to get some accounts

13:07.294 --> 13:08.592
on the front lines.

13:08.594 --> 13:11.328
They go crazy for
that secret agent stuff.

13:11.330 --> 13:14.932
Kid, you're too loud
to hold anything secret.

13:14.934 --> 13:16.670
Yeah, coming from the guy
with the big mouth.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.980
Ambush!

13:30.550 --> 13:32.652
Hit the floor.

13:35.221 --> 13:37.288
Brisco, hold your fire.

13:37.290 --> 13:39.760
You're wasting your ammo
without a target.

13:47.733 --> 13:50.335
Damn, what are they
waiting for?

13:50.337 --> 13:52.637
Maybe Brisco got 'em.

13:54.074 --> 13:55.575
What the....

13:59.545 --> 14:01.546
- Hold your fire.
- But I heard 'em!

14:01.548 --> 14:03.148
Well, we can't see them.

14:03.150 --> 14:05.218
Then how can they see us?

14:35.848 --> 14:37.783
Collins!

14:37.785 --> 14:39.216
Hey!

14:56.135 --> 14:58.168
Collins!

14:58.170 --> 14:59.736
Collins!

15:04.309 --> 15:08.281
- Hold your fire!
- They've gone quiet.

15:23.863 --> 15:25.298
Brisco!

15:51.724 --> 15:53.326
Come on, come on!

15:54.361 --> 15:56.697
No, no, no, no!

16:02.401 --> 16:04.504
Take cover!

16:22.454 --> 16:24.424
We got to go!

16:40.741 --> 16:44.278
Collins, St. John,
grab the trunk.

16:55.255 --> 16:56.557
What about the radio?

16:58.025 --> 16:59.724
All right, we need to move.

16:59.726 --> 17:02.460
Collins, take inventory,
we're heading out.

17:02.462 --> 17:04.228
Back to France?

17:04.230 --> 17:07.432
Damn it, St. John, is running
away your answer to everything?

17:07.434 --> 17:09.634
We're not running away,
I never did run away.

17:09.636 --> 17:11.269
Great, you're
delusional, too.

17:11.271 --> 17:13.203
What the hell's your problem
with me anyway, huh?

17:13.204 --> 17:15.172
You don't know what happened
to me and Collins out there.

17:15.174 --> 17:17.741
My problem is I don't trust
deserters having my back,

17:17.742 --> 17:20.978
- and you, Sir...
- Brisco.

17:20.980 --> 17:23.250
Back to guard duty.

17:28.454 --> 17:31.591
Sir, someone else
knows we're here.

17:33.193 --> 17:35.896
I don't think he's a soldier.

17:37.963 --> 17:41.001
Grey, bring him here.

17:58.885 --> 18:00.218
Haas?

18:00.220 --> 18:02.823
He's asking if we're angels.

18:04.389 --> 18:05.626
Talk to him.

18:21.174 --> 18:22.374
Haas?

18:22.376 --> 18:24.543
He says it makes him sad.

18:26.646 --> 18:28.011
Why?

18:28.013 --> 18:30.283
Because that means
he's not dead yet.

18:39.592 --> 18:41.794
Where'd he find these tags?

18:44.731 --> 18:46.364
Tell him we're here
to help him.

18:46.366 --> 18:48.598
We've got men
and plenty of ammo.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.835
We need to find these men.

18:50.837 --> 18:55.105
Wherever they are, Dr. Eris
isn't too far behind.

18:55.107 --> 18:57.010
Once we find her,
we can get out of here.

19:05.217 --> 19:08.019
Hey, we're here
to help you,

19:08.021 --> 19:10.221
but you got to help us
find these men.

19:10.223 --> 19:12.690
We need to stop
whoever did this.

19:12.692 --> 19:14.995
Please take us to them
so they can't do it again.

19:26.438 --> 19:28.541
Okay, we're heading out.

19:45.457 --> 19:47.426
They took
my son and daughter.

19:53.398 --> 19:54.731
My wife tried to stop them.

19:54.733 --> 19:57.037
They took her, too.

19:59.371 --> 20:01.107
I-I ran like a coward.

20:11.916 --> 20:15.653
This is God's punishment
for not stopping them.

20:15.655 --> 20:16.990
Who's them?

20:19.291 --> 20:22.061
Who took your family away?

20:27.634 --> 20:29.767
The men with
the black crosses.

20:29.769 --> 20:31.003
Nazis.

20:33.773 --> 20:36.842
No way, Collins, I told you
to stand guard in the back.

20:38.211 --> 20:41.311
What, you gonna argue with me?

20:41.313 --> 20:43.213
Captain, with all due respect,

20:43.215 --> 20:45.819
this old man doesn't seem
like he's quite all there.

20:47.854 --> 20:51.857
He may be crazy, but he's
the only lead we got.

20:55.328 --> 20:57.760
Keep moving, St. John.

20:57.762 --> 20:59.297
Who's side is he on?

20:59.299 --> 21:02.135
He could be leading us
right into an ambush.

21:05.503 --> 21:08.506
If he is, we'll be ready.

21:08.508 --> 21:11.511
Don't worry, I'm watching him.

21:13.613 --> 21:15.649
And I'm watching you.

21:34.133 --> 21:35.232
St. John, Collins.

21:35.234 --> 21:36.735
Already on it.

21:43.710 --> 21:45.375
People actually lived here?

21:45.377 --> 21:47.711
This must've been some
sort of last stand.

21:47.713 --> 21:50.347
They did not go down easy.

21:50.349 --> 21:53.317
Haas, ask him where
he got those dog-tags,

21:53.319 --> 21:54.987
if the men are still alive.

22:01.059 --> 22:03.963
Whoa, Captain, Captain,
over here.

22:10.603 --> 22:12.636
Is it just the two of them?

22:12.638 --> 22:14.638
There's a third
one over here.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.075
What happened to
the rest of 'em?

22:18.211 --> 22:20.845
Is it all men?
Is there any women?

22:20.847 --> 22:23.617
Without a full autopsy,
it'd be hard to tell.

22:39.065 --> 22:41.766
He said the men with the black
crosses brought her down

22:41.768 --> 22:44.000
to inspect the men before
they burned the everything.

22:44.002 --> 22:46.205
From where?
From where?

22:52.444 --> 22:54.612
From up there, the mountain.

22:54.614 --> 22:56.750
- Who's got eyes?
- I do.

22:58.017 --> 23:01.719
All right, I want you
to look at that hill,

23:01.721 --> 23:03.520
see if there's any activity.

23:03.522 --> 23:06.356
You two, guard the perimeter.

23:06.358 --> 23:08.928
If she's that close, the men
that took her are even closer.

23:14.099 --> 23:17.837
Hey Cap, come look
at these skeletons.

23:23.108 --> 23:25.078
I don't think they're made up
of the same person.

23:27.146 --> 23:28.912
Explain.

23:28.914 --> 23:31.984
Their limbs, they're on
the wrong side, see?

23:33.819 --> 23:36.322
They were broken apart and
reattached, soldered on.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.557
They took off the limbs and
put 'em on the opposite side?

23:41.559 --> 23:43.797
But why?

23:45.231 --> 23:47.765
Captain, there's some
sort of castle

23:47.767 --> 23:49.169
or fortress on that mountain.

23:50.470 --> 23:53.202
Castle? Come on.

23:53.204 --> 23:55.274
If you don't believe me,
see it for yourself.

23:56.341 --> 23:58.342
We've got movement
in the trees.

23:58.344 --> 24:00.013
You sure it ain't
just wildlife?

24:02.948 --> 24:05.149
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

24:05.151 --> 24:07.218
- We got to move.
- I don't like it, either.

24:07.220 --> 24:11.355
All right, we're heading out.

24:11.357 --> 24:15.292
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:15.294 --> 24:18.195
Haas?
Haas, what's he saying?

24:18.197 --> 24:19.797
He's saying kill yourself,

24:19.799 --> 24:21.367
kill yourself before
it's too late.

24:23.836 --> 24:25.704
Too late for what?

24:33.145 --> 24:35.714
Grey, stop firing.
Hold on to your bullets.

24:38.149 --> 24:40.052
Breathe.

24:45.758 --> 24:47.093
Deeply.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.396
Focus.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.634
What are these guys,
invisible?

24:58.936 --> 25:01.305
There, by the woods.

25:03.274 --> 25:05.608
Proceed to the north.
Follow me.

25:05.610 --> 25:08.080
Find cover in those trees!

25:13.319 --> 25:16.019
Whoever our shooter is,
his aim sure sucks.

25:16.021 --> 25:18.788
Yeah, well, he had no problem
taking out the old man.

25:18.790 --> 25:20.257
What's that?

25:20.259 --> 25:21.291
Stop.

25:21.293 --> 25:24.961
- Captain, this is...
- Halt.

25:24.963 --> 25:26.700
Hold your ground.

25:28.067 --> 25:29.269
We're open targets here.

25:32.137 --> 25:33.872
Exactly.

25:40.846 --> 25:42.482
Wait here.

26:10.908 --> 26:12.943
Why did you do that?

26:12.945 --> 26:14.211
They're not trying to kill us.

26:14.213 --> 26:15.512
They're trying to capture us.

26:15.514 --> 26:16.512
What?

26:16.514 --> 26:18.450
They want us alive.

26:20.351 --> 26:22.885
Okay, I'm ordering
a full retreat.

26:22.887 --> 26:26.022
On my count, we're heading back
to the river the way we came.

26:26.024 --> 26:29.425
Everybody got that?

26:29.427 --> 26:32.462
I want you to fire everything
you have at that barn.

26:32.464 --> 26:33.867
Load up.

26:39.538 --> 26:41.107
You boys ready?

26:44.243 --> 26:48.778
Three, two, one.

26:50.716 --> 26:52.348
Brisco!

26:52.350 --> 26:54.884
We're under fire.
We need to retreat!

26:54.886 --> 26:56.386
- Get out of here.
- This way!

26:56.388 --> 26:58.223
Save yourselves.

27:17.009 --> 27:18.608
Captain, which way?

27:21.079 --> 27:23.146
Looks like they gave up on
not trying to kill us.

27:23.148 --> 27:24.781
This way, into the mineshaft.

27:24.783 --> 27:26.316
No, no, Sir, wait,

27:26.318 --> 27:27.984
we need cover and a place
with tactical advantage.

27:27.986 --> 27:29.955
This way now.

27:33.925 --> 27:35.160
Come on.

27:39.330 --> 27:41.400
Come on, Sam!
Come on, Sam!

27:42.467 --> 27:44.634
Here they come.

27:45.805 --> 27:46.903
Okay, okay.

27:46.905 --> 27:50.039
All right, it's okay.

27:50.041 --> 27:52.942
Collins, hang
in there, buddy.

27:52.944 --> 27:55.645
He's losing a lot of blood.

27:55.647 --> 27:56.913
Bullet's still in him.

27:56.915 --> 27:58.415
Hang in there, come on.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.784
All right, I want everyone
to spread out.

28:00.786 --> 28:03.119
I want to hit it from all angles
in case they come in here.

28:03.121 --> 28:04.989
We're sitting ducks, man.

28:04.991 --> 28:06.992
Not if we hit them first.

28:09.494 --> 28:11.796
Wind.

28:11.798 --> 28:13.430
What's that, Private?

28:13.432 --> 28:16.200
It's coming from the back.

28:16.202 --> 28:18.602
That means there's
another way in here.

28:18.604 --> 28:21.471
Haas, go in the back
of the cave and scout it out,

28:21.473 --> 28:23.275
see if there's
another way out.

28:30.616 --> 28:33.987
Hang in there, buddy,
you're gonna be okay.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.468
Captain!

28:56.675 --> 28:59.311
Go! They're here.

29:04.684 --> 29:08.752
- No, no!
- Sam, no, no!

29:12.457 --> 29:13.590
Billy!

29:13.592 --> 29:16.026
Sam!

29:16.028 --> 29:17.862
Billy!

29:17.864 --> 29:19.430
Sam!

29:26.638 --> 29:29.107
Haas!

29:41.053 --> 29:43.021
Haas!

29:43.990 --> 29:45.923
Haas!

30:29.568 --> 30:31.738
Out this way!

30:50.522 --> 30:51.790
Damnit!

30:55.694 --> 30:57.126
I don't do good in
small spaces, Cap.

30:57.128 --> 30:58.662
It's okay, it's okay.

30:58.664 --> 31:00.363
Nuh-uh, I don't do good
in small spaces, Cap.

31:00.365 --> 31:02.132
- Grey, Grey.
- Get me out of here, man!

31:02.134 --> 31:05.769
Grey, Grey, look, it's okay.

31:05.771 --> 31:09.207
You're all right.
You're okay.

31:25.857 --> 31:27.160
How we doing?

31:29.494 --> 31:31.862
I pulled down all
the loose rocks I can,

31:31.864 --> 31:35.501
but there's still too much
debris blocking the exits.

31:37.803 --> 31:40.503
- All right.
- I'll keep trying.

31:40.505 --> 31:43.575
Hey, Captain,
come check this out.

31:46.345 --> 31:49.579
It's a pretty advanced
air filter.

31:49.581 --> 31:52.415
You could breathe on
the moon with this thing.

31:52.417 --> 31:56.519
Yeah, it's a great
prevention tool,

31:56.521 --> 31:58.689
especially against
biochemical agents.

31:58.691 --> 32:00.226
They gonna gas us?

32:08.966 --> 32:10.601
Tranquilizer.

32:10.603 --> 32:12.836
They wanted to take us alive.

32:12.838 --> 32:14.037
Why wouldn't
they just kill us?

32:14.039 --> 32:15.506
We were fighting back.

32:15.508 --> 32:18.374
They must've had orders
not to kill.

32:18.376 --> 32:21.411
Yeah, because Nazis
never disobey orders.

32:21.413 --> 32:23.813
That's why
they grabbed Collins.

32:23.815 --> 32:25.583
He was injured.

32:25.585 --> 32:27.317
He was the easiest one to take.

32:27.319 --> 32:29.152
What the hell
do they want us for?

32:29.154 --> 32:31.054
Tattoos.

32:31.056 --> 32:32.990
What?

32:32.992 --> 32:34.857
Brisco and Collins,
they had tattoos, right?

32:34.859 --> 32:38.095
What does that have to do
with anything at all?

32:38.097 --> 32:41.397
Because they skin guys alive
who have tattoos for decoration.

32:41.399 --> 32:43.067
That's a load of bullshit.

32:43.069 --> 32:44.203
Hey.

32:46.437 --> 32:47.904
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:47.906 --> 32:48.971
Hey, hey, hey!

32:50.309 --> 32:51.874
Get it off me.
Get it off me.

32:51.876 --> 32:54.344
- Grey, Grey.
- What are you doing, Grey?

32:54.346 --> 32:55.612
- Calm down!
- I'm not gonna let them get me.

32:55.614 --> 32:59.348
- Grey, Grey.
- Stop, stop!

32:59.350 --> 33:02.051
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

33:02.053 --> 33:05.622
It's okay. It's all right,
you're all right.

33:05.624 --> 33:08.392
Hey, it's okay to be afraid,
it's okay.

33:08.394 --> 33:09.792
Oh, yeah, is it?

33:09.794 --> 33:11.729
I bet they give out
medals to crybabies.

33:12.964 --> 33:14.865
Shut up.

33:14.867 --> 33:16.735
- Man up!
- Hey!

33:21.941 --> 33:24.441
Hey...

33:24.443 --> 33:28.010
Hey, I want you to use
that fear for fuel,

33:28.012 --> 33:29.278
huh, keep you going?

33:29.280 --> 33:31.615
All right?

33:31.617 --> 33:34.652
You can break down out there,
but I need you in here.

33:34.654 --> 33:35.818
Mmm-hm.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.288
Yeah, you got it?

33:37.290 --> 33:39.323
- Yeah.
- All right.

33:39.325 --> 33:43.626
It's not just the fear that's
getting to him, it's the air.

33:43.628 --> 33:46.296
- It's all right.
- Or lack of it.

33:46.298 --> 33:48.531
We're gonna suffocate in here
if we don't get out.

33:48.533 --> 33:50.435
We're gonna get out.

34:25.338 --> 34:27.337
Hey.

34:27.339 --> 34:28.737
I already looked.

34:28.739 --> 34:30.873
The explosion's caused
too much damage.

34:30.876 --> 34:33.812
Both ways out are
completely walled up.

34:41.351 --> 34:42.754
Who's got a grenade?

34:44.022 --> 34:45.489
I do.

34:52.897 --> 34:53.864
Fire in the hole!

34:59.138 --> 35:01.040
St. John.

35:04.642 --> 35:07.176
Yeah, we got a crawlspace.

35:07.178 --> 35:09.312
It's tight, but I think
we can make it.

35:11.950 --> 35:13.149
I think we better
do this quick,

35:13.151 --> 35:14.718
or this place might cave.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.785
Wait, you're saying we
go through that crawlspace

35:16.787 --> 35:18.287
and then come
out the other side,

35:18.289 --> 35:19.388
get picked off one by one?

35:19.390 --> 35:21.524
Well, you got a better idea?

35:21.526 --> 35:24.727
Grey, help me take off
this guy's uniform.

35:24.729 --> 35:27.062
You gonna dress up
like a Nazi?

35:27.064 --> 35:28.533
Why not?

35:30.803 --> 35:32.305
Okay.

35:55.093 --> 35:56.796
Yeah, this could work.

36:02.968 --> 36:04.904
All right.

36:09.173 --> 36:12.344
What, you don't like
the smell of Nazi scum?

36:18.115 --> 36:22.451
Son of a bitch, you
look like a damn Nazi.

36:22.453 --> 36:23.854
One thing about Nazis,

36:23.856 --> 36:25.821
they're known for
their uniformity.

36:25.823 --> 36:28.457
Plus, they don't know
what I look like.

36:28.459 --> 36:31.861
Even if they did,
I'll be wearing this.

36:31.863 --> 36:33.799
Let's go.

36:36.501 --> 36:38.104
- Equipment?
- Leave it.

36:45.343 --> 36:47.778
- Let's go, let's go.
- You want me to go in there?

36:47.780 --> 36:48.714
Yup.

36:49.981 --> 36:51.647
I don't think I'm gonna fit.

36:51.649 --> 36:53.485
Oh, you'll fit, now come on.

37:01.593 --> 37:04.895
The Nazis, of course.

37:04.897 --> 37:08.966
Grey, don't freak out
on me back there.

37:08.968 --> 37:09.966
Ah!

37:09.968 --> 37:10.966
Holy crap.

37:17.341 --> 37:18.441
Cap, you all right?

37:18.443 --> 37:19.810
No, Cap, stop, stop, stop,

37:19.812 --> 37:21.645
you're going to get
an infection.

37:21.647 --> 37:23.779
That's what they taught
us in boot.

37:23.781 --> 37:27.049
Yeah, screw boot camp,
I'm a damn Eagle Scout.

37:27.051 --> 37:28.750
All right, unless you want
an infection in your arm

37:28.752 --> 37:30.654
from the bacteria in
your saliva, go on,

37:30.656 --> 37:32.321
keep sucking away,

37:32.323 --> 37:34.290
but you don't even know
if there's venom in it.

37:34.292 --> 37:36.892
Oh God this hurts.

37:36.894 --> 37:39.130
All right, let's just
keep on moving, okay?

39:11.189 --> 39:12.624
Oh...

40:21.359 --> 40:23.359
Damn, got him.

40:23.361 --> 40:26.031
No, no, no, the morons
think he's one of them.

40:26.897 --> 40:27.964
I don't like it.

40:27.966 --> 40:29.665
Stop. What are you doing?

40:29.667 --> 40:32.468
You're gonna blow his cover
before he's even started.

40:32.470 --> 40:33.839
Stay calm.

42:28.319 --> 42:29.955
Elis?

43:07.959 --> 43:09.094
<i>Achtung!</i>

43:38.689 --> 43:41.560
Hey, hey, hey, St. John,
why don't you come on?

43:43.794 --> 43:45.895
- Jesus.
- Cap.

43:45.897 --> 43:49.598
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.966
Yeah?

43:50.968 --> 43:53.002
Where's Eris?
Is she still here?

43:53.004 --> 43:54.803
I saw the guards.
They're leaving west.

43:54.805 --> 43:56.638
She's here.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.243
They're planning on launching
some kind of operation tonight.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.078
All right, fellas,
I need you to get

44:03.080 --> 44:06.383
in these
Nazi uniforms quickly.

44:06.385 --> 44:07.750
Hey, you think
that whole Clark Kent routine

44:07.752 --> 44:08.850
is gonna work?

44:08.852 --> 44:10.252
It worked for me.

44:10.254 --> 44:11.888
I'm the only one
that knows German.

44:11.890 --> 44:13.388
What do we do if
they question us?

44:13.390 --> 44:16.593
They won't, especially
when they see our cargo.

44:16.595 --> 44:18.928
It should buy us enough time
to infiltrate their base

44:18.930 --> 44:20.196
and rescue the doctor.

44:20.198 --> 44:21.663
Cargo?

44:21.665 --> 44:25.100
- I'll grab this officer.
- St. John, don't bother.

44:25.102 --> 44:26.769
How am I gonna get inside?

44:26.771 --> 44:29.671
You're the cargo.

44:29.673 --> 44:32.610
Come on, fellas, let's go.
Get changed quickly.

44:51.662 --> 44:52.962
So what, we're just
gonna walk up

44:52.964 --> 44:54.462
to that front door and knock?

44:54.464 --> 44:55.964
Well, it's a little
late to parachute

44:55.966 --> 44:57.133
through the roof, so....

44:57.135 --> 44:59.134
Sure she's in there?

44:59.136 --> 45:02.071
Everything points to this
being a research facility,

45:02.073 --> 45:04.073
not a military outpost.

45:04.075 --> 45:07.042
Look, there's no tanks,

45:07.044 --> 45:09.611
not even a team of watchmen.

45:09.613 --> 45:11.247
Why keep themselves so
vulnerable to an attack

45:11.249 --> 45:13.149
if they can't even
defend themselves?

45:13.151 --> 45:15.850
There must be some other
defense system in place.

45:15.852 --> 45:19.821
That's probably why they
brought the good doctor here.

45:19.823 --> 45:21.491
Remember, gentlemen,

45:21.493 --> 45:23.859
no aggression unless
absolutely necessary.

45:23.861 --> 45:25.297
Right.

48:26.176 --> 48:28.176
- Jesus Christ.
- Shit.

48:28.178 --> 48:29.613
Crazy bitch.

48:31.948 --> 48:33.816
Well, yes, I understand,

48:33.818 --> 48:39.855
but we probably shouldn't test
it on them because of the....

48:39.857 --> 48:41.423
Found her.

48:41.425 --> 48:43.158
Sure she wants to leave?

48:43.160 --> 48:45.361
Yeah, she seems pretty chummy
with her new Nazi friends.

48:45.363 --> 48:46.895
She's been here
for two months.

48:46.897 --> 48:48.763
You do whatever
you have to do survive.

48:48.765 --> 48:49.964
What if she doesn't
want to go?

48:49.966 --> 48:51.200
Then we kill the bitch.

48:51.202 --> 48:53.069
No, we need her alive,

48:53.071 --> 48:56.772
regardless if she's
changed her morals or not.

48:56.774 --> 48:58.274
So what, we're just
going to walk up to her

48:58.276 --> 48:59.709
and take her out,
it's that easy?

48:59.711 --> 49:01.109
Yes.

49:01.111 --> 49:02.880
These are
inexperienced soldiers.

49:04.080 --> 49:08.151
How old was the guard, 16?

49:08.153 --> 49:10.486
This is a research facility.

49:10.488 --> 49:12.921
Their greatest weapon
is their intelligence,

49:12.923 --> 49:14.457
not their muscle.

49:14.459 --> 49:18.026
Yeah, all the big muscle
already evacuated.

49:18.028 --> 49:21.696
Just what kind of operation
are they planning here, anyway?

49:21.698 --> 49:24.066
Enough debate, let's go.

49:24.068 --> 49:27.703
Captain, your wrist.

49:27.705 --> 49:28.937
We'll bust through that door,
I want you to shoot everyone

49:28.939 --> 49:30.372
that's not a doctor.

49:30.374 --> 49:32.707
Grey, you stay behind
and watch the hall.

49:32.709 --> 49:35.310
Once we start shooting,
who knows how many Nazis

49:35.312 --> 49:37.714
we're going to attract.

49:37.716 --> 49:39.048
You got it?

49:39.050 --> 49:42.084
Hey, he asked you a question.

49:42.086 --> 49:43.685
I got it.

49:54.966 --> 49:56.899
Don't scream.

49:56.901 --> 49:58.734
I'm Captain Alan Rogers
from the United States Army.

49:58.736 --> 50:01.104
We're here to take you home.

50:01.106 --> 50:03.571
You hurt?

50:03.573 --> 50:07.642
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right.

50:07.644 --> 50:09.278
Grey?

50:09.280 --> 50:11.482
Hallway's still empty,
but we got to go.

50:12.517 --> 50:13.816
We need to go now.

50:13.818 --> 50:16.685
Are you the men
from the cave?

50:16.687 --> 50:18.553
Wait, do you have Collins?

50:18.555 --> 50:20.622
Yes, he's here along
with another man.

50:20.624 --> 50:22.957
- Brisco?
- Perhaps.

50:22.959 --> 50:24.526
They brought them both in
separately earlier today.

50:24.528 --> 50:25.928
They're keeping
them downstairs.

50:25.930 --> 50:27.595
We can get in there
through here.

50:27.597 --> 50:29.397
Do you hear that, Cap?
They're alive.

50:29.399 --> 50:31.165
Our mission was
to save the doctor.

50:31.167 --> 50:34.770
- We got her, now we got to go.
- We need to save our men.

50:34.772 --> 50:37.339
Please, we can save your men
and leave.

50:37.341 --> 50:39.174
- Let's go.
- Someone's coming.

50:39.176 --> 50:40.308
Grey, close the door.

50:40.310 --> 50:41.709
We busted the lock.

50:41.711 --> 50:43.379
We cannot stay here,
we got to go.

50:43.381 --> 50:46.015
Do you want to save
your men or not?

50:46.017 --> 50:47.816
How do you get out of here?

50:47.818 --> 50:49.484
There's a ravine that leads
down to a passage in the back.

50:49.486 --> 50:51.287
We can go through there.
We use it for sewage.

50:51.289 --> 50:52.555
We can get out through there.

50:52.557 --> 50:54.723
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

50:54.725 --> 50:56.491
- Captain?
- I said let's go.

50:56.493 --> 50:58.363
I can barricade the door
once we're through.

51:04.501 --> 51:06.470
How did you even find me?

51:08.439 --> 51:10.339
We weren't the first guys
looking for you.

51:10.341 --> 51:12.674
I know.

51:12.676 --> 51:14.075
I can't even contemplate

51:14.077 --> 51:15.276
the men who've come
to look for me.

51:15.278 --> 51:17.912
I fear they died in vain.

51:17.914 --> 51:19.314
Why do think that?

51:19.316 --> 51:21.716
The Nazis trust me
implicitly now,

51:21.718 --> 51:26.221
and of course I've been leading
them completely off-track.

51:26.223 --> 51:27.955
You've been doing
research for the Nazis?

51:27.957 --> 51:34.096
What they consider research.
I mean, they...

52:24.682 --> 52:26.515
We must get
to the laboratory.

52:26.517 --> 52:29.020
If they know you're here,
they'll turn you into subjects.

52:30.254 --> 52:31.252
Subjects?

52:31.254 --> 52:32.388
You're soldiers.

52:32.390 --> 52:33.725
What are they doing to them?

52:37.227 --> 52:39.127
- What are you doing?
- Are you one of them?

52:39.129 --> 52:40.930
It's a quarantine bell.

52:40.932 --> 52:43.068
It's to warn everyone that
the contagion has gotten loose.

52:45.903 --> 52:47.738
Stand back.

53:05.823 --> 53:07.223
Come.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.627
All right. Go.

53:16.234 --> 53:18.436
Where are Collins and Brisco?

53:19.903 --> 53:20.938
What bit you?

53:23.506 --> 53:25.540
- A snake.
- You mean a viper.

53:25.542 --> 53:27.075
It's not important.

53:27.077 --> 53:28.946
It will be once the poison
reaches your heart.

53:30.481 --> 53:33.450
Here, here, give me your arm.

53:37.555 --> 53:39.354
Hey, where the hell
are our men?

53:39.356 --> 53:40.890
I'll take you to them,

53:40.892 --> 53:42.894
but first we need to save
your captain's life.

53:44.260 --> 53:46.928
Who else knows you're here?

53:46.930 --> 53:48.263
Our colonel.

53:48.265 --> 53:50.031
He gave us the mission after
we stormed Normandy.

53:50.033 --> 53:52.067
Oh thank God you got to
Normandy when you did.

53:52.069 --> 53:53.968
If you had been there
one day later,

53:53.970 --> 53:56.571
you might have had a
totally different outcome.

53:56.573 --> 53:58.674
Why do you say that?

53:58.676 --> 54:00.178
Give me your vein.

54:05.917 --> 54:10.852
Captain, if you die, there will
be no one to lead your men,

54:10.854 --> 54:15.024
and I'll be in a worse position
than I was when you came.

54:15.026 --> 54:17.258
Do you have any idea what the
Nazis will do to me

54:17.260 --> 54:18.759
if I'm recaptured?

54:18.761 --> 54:22.031
It's a dry bite.
There's no poison.

54:22.033 --> 54:26.504
Are you prepared to risk
your life on that, or mine?

54:29.707 --> 54:31.573
Where is Collins?

54:31.575 --> 54:34.109
Please, take us to our men.

54:34.111 --> 54:37.078
In the five minutes
that it would take me,

54:37.080 --> 54:39.048
you would be dead.

54:39.050 --> 54:40.616
I'm surprised his heart
is still functioning

54:40.618 --> 54:42.453
with poison in his system.

54:43.787 --> 54:47.524
Captain, let her help you.

54:49.560 --> 54:52.294
If you die, I will never
forgive myself.

54:52.296 --> 54:55.196
You've been through God knows
what trying to save me.

54:55.198 --> 54:59.537
Please let me do this
for you, please.

55:06.343 --> 55:08.111
What's in that?

55:24.361 --> 55:27.294
Thank you.

55:27.296 --> 55:30.001
No, Captain, thank you.

55:36.140 --> 55:37.775
Captain.

55:40.477 --> 55:42.113
Captain Rogers.

55:47.685 --> 55:50.752
I have good news.

55:50.754 --> 55:52.720
Your wound is
healing nicely.

55:52.722 --> 55:55.524
You were right, it was
a dry bite, no poison.

55:55.526 --> 55:57.995
They turned you into a Nazi.

56:03.635 --> 56:05.232
When I was a little girl,

56:05.234 --> 56:09.136
I had a nasty habit of not
cleaning up my room.

56:09.138 --> 56:11.038
It used to aggravate
my mother to no end.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.975
She would ask me and ask me
to clean it.

56:13.977 --> 56:18.747
And sometimes I would,
but not very well.

56:18.749 --> 56:21.883
And then one day,
I came home to discover

56:21.885 --> 56:23.819
that all my of
my things were gone:

56:23.821 --> 56:26.689
my clothes, my toys,
even my bed.

56:26.691 --> 56:28.857
And at first, I thought
that my mother

56:28.859 --> 56:30.457
must've just hidden them.

56:30.459 --> 56:36.033
But no, she had thrown
everything out and burned it.

56:37.868 --> 56:39.667
I had to start over.

56:39.669 --> 56:41.203
But you know what I realized?

56:41.205 --> 56:44.171
I didn't miss any of
those old things.

56:44.173 --> 56:49.176
I was ready for new toys
and new joys,

56:49.178 --> 56:52.082
new wonders for me
to discover.

56:57.220 --> 56:59.723
Why don't you let us out
of here, you stupid bitch?

57:01.524 --> 57:05.461
The only way to make way
for new wonders and new joys

57:05.463 --> 57:07.529
is to get rid of the old ones.

57:07.531 --> 57:13.435
That's the only way for a new
evolution to occur for our race.

57:13.437 --> 57:15.102
The master race, huh?

57:15.104 --> 57:19.441
I knew it.
You're as bad as Hitler.

57:19.443 --> 57:21.709
Yeah, I bet he buggers you.

57:21.711 --> 57:23.078
Is that what gets you off?

57:23.080 --> 57:25.046
I've never met the man,

57:25.048 --> 57:27.783
and quite frankly,
I don't care to.

57:27.785 --> 57:29.984
I find his methods vile.

57:29.986 --> 57:32.319
What do you call this?

57:32.321 --> 57:33.721
What are your methods?

57:33.723 --> 57:35.325
What are you planning?

57:54.946 --> 57:57.846
The poison was meant
to induce starvation

57:57.848 --> 58:00.082
and also
encourage cannibalism.

58:00.084 --> 58:03.651
The Fuhrer liked the idea of his
rivals eating each other alive.

58:03.653 --> 58:06.388
Stop it, you're psychotic.

58:06.390 --> 58:08.924
And they're not, the ones
who ruined the world,

58:08.926 --> 58:11.225
the ones who destroyed all
of its natural resources

58:11.227 --> 58:13.761
in an endless
gluttony of greed?

58:13.763 --> 58:15.763
Death is not the answer.

58:31.414 --> 58:33.515
No, no, no, stop, no,
Grey, don't...

58:33.517 --> 58:35.383
You don't know what
you're drinking!

58:35.385 --> 58:36.919
Don't drink the water!

58:36.921 --> 58:39.055
Grey, that's an order,
that's an order.

58:39.057 --> 58:41.323
I'm thirsty.
I don't care.

58:41.325 --> 58:43.027
I don't care.

58:45.897 --> 58:48.800
I didn't poison the water.

58:54.338 --> 58:57.772
Dr. Eris?

58:57.774 --> 59:00.178
Bring in Patient C.

59:17.593 --> 59:19.129
That's one of ours.

59:22.665 --> 59:24.700
Woods.

59:24.702 --> 59:27.205
- Hose him down.
- Woods.

59:31.209 --> 59:33.441
Oh, no.

59:33.443 --> 59:36.877
No, no...

59:36.879 --> 59:39.816
No, no, stop.

01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:04.406
I can't get any slack.

01:00:04.408 --> 01:00:06.176
Let me try yours.

01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:11.848
Van Straten?

01:00:15.452 --> 01:00:16.750
Doctor Van Straten.

01:00:16.752 --> 01:00:19.555
The viral load
is near 100,000.

01:00:19.557 --> 01:00:21.325
He's about to pop.

01:00:25.729 --> 01:00:27.131
Open the chamber.

01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:37.506
You must be so scared,

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:39.307
but you're a vessel.

01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:41.942
Just as the Messiah's
blood cleanses our sins,

01:00:41.944 --> 01:00:45.446
so too does your blood
cleanse the world,

01:00:45.448 --> 01:00:48.885
and for that I thank you.

01:00:54.492 --> 01:00:58.694
No, no.

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:01.162
- What are you doing?
- No, no.

01:01:01.164 --> 01:01:02.566
What are you doing?

01:01:06.403 --> 01:01:08.071
No.

01:01:18.316 --> 01:01:19.917
Open the hive.

01:01:22.252 --> 01:01:24.953
No.

01:01:31.528 --> 01:01:33.529
Why are you making
us watch this?

01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:36.968
You don't find
this curious? Pity.

01:01:42.238 --> 01:01:44.038
Let him out of there!

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.877
Would a mild sedative
help calm your nerves?

01:01:59.823 --> 01:02:01.823
Okay, that's enough.

01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:03.593
Engage the vacuum.

01:03:19.535 --> 01:03:23.506
Don't be angry,
you'll be out soon.

01:03:27.276 --> 01:03:29.112
Bring in another man.

01:03:47.664 --> 01:03:50.001
Water for him, please.

01:04:09.419 --> 01:04:13.087
I forgot, an empty stomach
will do that.

01:04:13.089 --> 01:04:18.729
Well, just know I tried to give
you every comfort before....

01:05:11.582 --> 01:05:12.848
No!

01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:14.582
Oh, don't eat it.

01:05:14.584 --> 01:05:17.586
Our analysis isn't prepared
for that effect.

01:05:17.588 --> 01:05:20.388
Why didn't you test one
of the healthy men first?

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:23.258
They wanted us to
eradicate the camps first.

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.292
Believe me,
it wasn't my choice.

01:05:25.294 --> 01:05:27.495
Bring in another
man from the pit.

01:05:27.497 --> 01:05:28.798
Wait.

01:05:31.468 --> 01:05:33.337
It's starting.

01:05:48.385 --> 01:05:51.419
It works, it really works.

01:05:51.421 --> 01:05:53.687
But that could've been because
he just ate the bug.

01:05:53.689 --> 01:05:56.892
No, it bit him,
I know it did.

01:05:56.894 --> 01:05:58.459
Our studies are not prepared

01:05:58.461 --> 01:06:00.028
for the ingestion
of the specimen.

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:03.397
His stomach acids would
have destroyed the bug.

01:06:03.399 --> 01:06:06.267
We specifically manufactured
the plague

01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:07.903
to be carried by
the blood stream...

01:06:07.905 --> 01:06:10.171
- I'm not sure.
- ...not through ingestion.

01:06:10.173 --> 01:06:11.642
I'm not sure.

01:06:13.377 --> 01:06:15.810
Proceed to the next stage.

01:06:15.812 --> 01:06:17.912
I'm not sure.

01:06:17.914 --> 01:06:19.316
Proceed.

01:06:27.323 --> 01:06:29.659
Prepare for
the final experiment.

01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:35.231
Which means I
must get ready, too.

01:06:59.122 --> 01:07:02.359
So which one will it be,
Captain?

01:07:04.193 --> 01:07:05.826
Excuse me?

01:07:05.828 --> 01:07:09.765
Which one of your men do
you want me to test first?

01:07:09.767 --> 01:07:11.098
Me.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.401
- No.
- Test me.

01:07:13.403 --> 01:07:16.404
- No, no!
- You're not an option.

01:07:16.406 --> 01:07:19.640
God damn it, let us go.

01:07:19.642 --> 01:07:21.642
Him?

01:07:21.644 --> 01:07:23.310
What?

01:07:23.312 --> 01:07:27.848
Hmm, an interesting choice.

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:29.816
- I didn't choose anyone.
- Captain?

01:07:29.818 --> 01:07:34.288
I didn't choose anyone,
I swear, I swear.

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:37.325
I didn't choose anyone,
I swear.

01:07:37.327 --> 01:07:40.261
No, captain, captain, no!

01:07:40.263 --> 01:07:42.830
Come on, help me!
Come on!

01:07:42.832 --> 01:07:46.500
The struggle is good for
the autonomic nervous system,

01:07:46.502 --> 01:07:48.035
pumps up muscles,
makes the veins

01:07:48.037 --> 01:07:51.004
easier to find and drill into.

01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:53.140
Open the hive.

01:07:53.142 --> 01:07:55.612
Cap, come on!

01:08:09.392 --> 01:08:13.694
Haas!

01:08:13.696 --> 01:08:15.365
Haas!

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:31.515
Engage the vacuum,
85 percent power.

01:08:38.888 --> 01:08:41.423
Is this how you're going
to win your war,

01:08:41.425 --> 01:08:45.029
take over the world
with your sick plague?

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:08.349
Haas!

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.319
Haas!

01:09:27.703 --> 01:09:31.607
Engaging vacuum,
100 percent power.

01:09:53.095 --> 01:09:54.397
It's all right.

01:10:19.789 --> 01:10:21.624
Don't.

01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:31.765
It works.

01:10:31.767 --> 01:10:34.902
I really am immune
to the virus.

01:10:34.904 --> 01:10:36.807
I am pure!

01:11:01.498 --> 01:11:03.798
Proceed with separation
of the hives.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.133
The locusts will live for
only another 24 hours.

01:11:06.135 --> 01:11:07.368
Thank you.

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:08.803
This plan will never work.

01:11:08.805 --> 01:11:11.840
Oh, Captain,
it's already done.

01:11:11.842 --> 01:11:14.908
The world as you know it
is no more.

01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.478
So your bugs can fly around
the world in 24 hours?

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.982
No, but our planes can.

01:11:23.351 --> 01:11:27.255
Tokyo, Paris, London,

01:11:27.257 --> 01:11:29.857
New York, Chicago.

01:11:29.859 --> 01:11:31.660
We'll start in
the Northern Hemisphere,

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:34.062
and then the natural
progression of the contagion

01:11:34.064 --> 01:11:36.467
will move south.

01:11:42.338 --> 01:11:43.904
Wait.

01:11:43.906 --> 01:11:45.874
You said you weren't
going to kill us.

01:11:45.876 --> 01:11:49.546
No, Captain, I said
I wasn't going to kill you.

01:12:15.538 --> 01:12:17.170
Collins?

01:12:17.172 --> 01:12:18.438
Collins, is that you?

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.176
Jesus Christ,
what did they...

01:12:36.126 --> 01:12:38.859
Damn it, Sam,
it's me, Billy.

01:12:38.861 --> 01:12:40.428
St. John, grab one
of their arms.

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:42.029
I'll grab the other,
we got to pull them apart.

01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:45.702
No, we can save them.
We can save them!

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:48.803
Billy!

01:12:48.805 --> 01:12:50.574
Sam, they're....

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:03.251
- Stop.
- Shoot.

01:13:03.253 --> 01:13:05.620
I said stop.

01:13:05.622 --> 01:13:07.124
Why won't you shoot me?

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:09.424
Pull!

01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:10.625
No!

01:13:10.627 --> 01:13:12.158
John, there's no other way.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.832
No, we can save them.
We have to save them.

01:13:20.102 --> 01:13:24.675
St. John, it's the only way.
We need to pull them apart.

01:13:58.874 --> 01:14:02.344
You bastards!

01:14:02.346 --> 01:14:03.844
No!

01:14:07.751 --> 01:14:09.483
Hold on to me.

01:14:09.485 --> 01:14:11.120
St. John!

01:14:13.823 --> 01:14:15.889
Hold on to me.

01:14:15.891 --> 01:14:18.794
St. John, help me save her.

01:14:19.663 --> 01:14:21.428
You're saving her?

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:24.432
No, no, we need her.

01:14:24.434 --> 01:14:26.133
She's no good to us dead.

01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:28.502
She created the plague,
she'll know how to stop it.

01:14:28.504 --> 01:14:29.603
You'll never stop it.

01:14:29.605 --> 01:14:31.005
Yes, I can.

01:14:31.007 --> 01:14:32.139
- You'll never stop it.
- I have to.

01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:33.674
- Not you.
- Yes, I can.

01:14:33.676 --> 01:14:34.908
Not you.

01:15:04.539 --> 01:15:07.343
St. John, St. John....

01:15:09.779 --> 01:15:10.877
St. John?

01:15:10.879 --> 01:15:12.048
Collins?

01:15:14.217 --> 01:15:15.282
Collins? Collins.

01:15:15.284 --> 01:15:17.386
- St. John.
- You're alive.

01:15:22.892 --> 01:15:25.259
St. John.

01:15:25.261 --> 01:15:26.760
Kill me.

01:15:26.762 --> 01:15:30.464
No, no, we can fix this.
We can fix this.

01:15:30.466 --> 01:15:34.135
I'll never be the same.

01:15:34.137 --> 01:15:35.469
Kill me.

01:15:35.471 --> 01:15:38.272
No, don't you give up
on me, Sam.

01:15:38.274 --> 01:15:40.908
Please, please.

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:42.913
St. John...

01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:45.679
Make the pain end.

01:15:45.681 --> 01:15:49.684
Please make the pain end.

01:15:49.686 --> 01:15:52.789
Make the pain end.

01:16:25.855 --> 01:16:27.357
Shit.

01:16:39.903 --> 01:16:41.838
The locusts.

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:51.679
There's only one patch of
land nearby to land a plane.

01:16:51.681 --> 01:16:54.947
That has to be where that
Von Straten is heading.

01:16:54.949 --> 01:16:56.651
I bet my life on it.

01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:58.789
Hey, there's another Nazi helmet
and a jacket back there.

01:17:04.761 --> 01:17:07.728
Have they loaded
the bugs yet?

01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:09.332
Not yet.

01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:17.371
There's two of us
against the world, Cap.

01:17:17.373 --> 01:17:20.506
Better odds than
David had against Goliath.

01:17:20.508 --> 01:17:22.645
He was one man.

01:17:23.546 --> 01:17:25.479
Don't focus on how many
there are of them.

01:17:25.481 --> 01:17:29.750
All we got to do is stop
that plane from taking off.

01:17:29.752 --> 01:17:31.821
Or die trying, huh?

01:17:34.123 --> 01:17:35.525
That's what we signed up for.

01:17:37.059 --> 01:17:39.029
My dad signed me up.

01:17:40.596 --> 01:17:42.298
He's counting on you.

01:17:45.735 --> 01:17:50.337
I lied to you.
I did run away.

01:17:50.339 --> 01:17:53.273
I know.

01:17:53.275 --> 01:17:56.010
That's what
second chances are for.

01:17:56.012 --> 01:17:58.446
Collins tried to stop me.

01:17:58.448 --> 01:18:00.346
Everyone thinks it was
the other way around,

01:18:00.348 --> 01:18:03.416
and he was the one that wanted
to run, but it was me.

01:18:03.418 --> 01:18:04.919
It was me.

01:18:04.921 --> 01:18:06.420
None of that matters anymore.

01:18:06.422 --> 01:18:09.156
What matters is
you're here with me.

01:18:09.158 --> 01:18:11.160
We're not going anywhere.

01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:17.497
I killed
my best friend, Cap.

01:18:17.499 --> 01:18:19.401
So what are you
gonna do about it?

01:18:26.176 --> 01:18:28.710
All we got to do is
take out that plane?

01:18:28.712 --> 01:18:32.880
Just one plane.
How simple's that?

01:18:32.882 --> 01:18:35.515
Too goddamn simple.

01:18:35.517 --> 01:18:37.216
Child's play.

01:18:37.218 --> 01:18:40.654
You got a good plan?

01:18:40.656 --> 01:18:42.559
Only if it's
better than yours.

01:20:07.944 --> 01:20:10.080
Die!

01:20:18.887 --> 01:20:20.422
No!

01:20:24.793 --> 01:20:26.595
No! Captain!

01:20:29.498 --> 01:20:31.499
Captain, burn me!

01:20:31.501 --> 01:20:33.934
Burn me! Kill me!

01:21:14.642 --> 01:21:15.779
I'm alive.

01:21:17.613 --> 01:21:19.182
I'm alive.

01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:46.907
Surely you must have
seen some of her formulas.

01:21:46.909 --> 01:21:50.344
You came back with some
of her calculations?

01:21:50.346 --> 01:21:54.115
Look, do you have any idea
the military advantage

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:56.852
this Eris research
could give us?

01:21:59.655 --> 01:22:02.456
It's okay, it's okay,
don't worry.

01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:05.091
It's okay if we use it.

01:22:05.093 --> 01:22:07.193
See, we're the good guys,
we are.

01:22:07.195 --> 01:22:10.130
We can use it,
we're the good guys.

01:22:10.132 --> 01:22:11.398
Come on.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.568
The president
will see you now.

01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:15.335
That's the president.

01:22:15.337 --> 01:22:17.173
Snap out of it, let's go.

01:22:19.742 --> 01:22:21.244
Come on.

01:22:46.401 --> 01:22:48.501
I wanted to thank
you personally

01:22:48.503 --> 01:22:50.903
for everything you did
for the country,

01:22:50.905 --> 01:22:53.974
the entire world overseas,

01:22:53.976 --> 01:22:56.210
although personally,

01:22:56.212 --> 01:22:59.645
I haven't forgiven you
for resigning

01:22:59.647 --> 01:23:01.782
and taking up civilian
life so quickly.

01:23:05.754 --> 01:23:09.122
Thank you, Alan.

01:23:13.495 --> 01:23:16.429
Son, are you okay?

01:23:16.431 --> 01:23:19.265
This is why
she didn't kill me.

01:23:19.267 --> 01:23:21.801
I was her failsafe.

01:23:21.803 --> 01:23:24.904
Oh my God.

01:23:24.906 --> 01:23:27.307
- This man needs help.
- Someone get a doctor.

01:23:27.309 --> 01:23:30.143
Get away from me.
Stay away from me.

01:23:30.145 --> 01:23:31.444
Someone get a medic.
Medic!

01:23:31.446 --> 01:23:34.080
This is what she wanted.

01:23:34.082 --> 01:23:38.618
They're still gonna win.
They're still gonna win.

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.423
They're still gonna win.

01:23:44.126 --> 01:23:46.126
They're still gonna win.

01:23:48.163 --> 01:23:51.264
Get down, get down.
