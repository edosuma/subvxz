00:17.726 --> 00:20.687
That's my grandbaby.
You haven't seen my granddaughter yet.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.313
[woman laughs]

00:22.856 --> 00:25.692
[chattering]

00:28.111 --> 00:29.779
[Tim] I've said it many times,

00:29.863 --> 00:32.991
you can't run a police department
being reactive to anything.

00:33.074 --> 00:36.661
You have to have proactive units
out there, going out looking for crime.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.291
<i>I had to restructure the department.</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:44.711
<i>I had to put a team of people out there</i>
<i>who was gonna be proactive to crime.</i>

00:44.794 --> 00:47.756
<i>That meant catch the person</i>
<i>before they commit homicide,</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:51.384
<i>catch the person before they did</i>
<i>a B and E or robbery or whatever.</i>

00:54.345 --> 00:58.349
<i>I picked the officers around the</i>
<i>department that I knew was hard chargers.</i>

00:59.267 --> 01:01.936
<i>They were out there making arrests,</i>
<i>policing the city,</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:03.980
<i>out there looking for crime.</i>

01:04.063 --> 01:05.565
<i>So, I hand-picked them.</i>

01:05.648 --> 01:07.984
[officer] What does C.A.T.T. mean?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.945
Crime Area...
Crime Area Target Team.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.698
[officer] Target? What's "target"?

01:14.616 --> 01:18.203
Specific areas in the city
have high crime areas,

01:18.787 --> 01:21.372
where they're all hanging out,
acting stupid.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.958
-We go and hit them.
-[officer] Can I go?

01:24.667 --> 01:28.963
[fireworks crackling]

01:31.549 --> 01:32.383
[officer] I love it!

01:32.467 --> 01:34.761
Get your ass on the ground.
Get on the ground.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.138
Stupid motherfucker.
Hands behind your back.

-[man] Oh, shit! Man, what the fuck, bro?
-[officer] Next time, you listen.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.647
Next time you listen.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.023
[man] Alright, man.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.693
[officer] Put your hands behind your back.
Check his pockets.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.778
I told you to stop.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.864
[man] I wasn't doing nothing
but talking to her.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.991
[officer] Then why attack
and grab our people? [man] All I was doing
was playing with her, bro.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.995
[officer] Next time, listen to the police.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.080
[man] I didn't know
you were talking to me.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.457
-[officer] Oh, you really didn't?
-[man] No, I swear.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.210
[officer] Well, you know now.
You want me to tell you again?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.254
Thank you.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.591
-[man] Can I call my girl?
-[officer] No, you can't call her.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.553
[man] What's the problem, though?
I didn't do anything.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.514
[officer] Let's go. Get up.
Best way you can, get up.

[anchor] <i>Jessica Dupnack talked</i>
<i>with the city's new police chief today.</i>

03:26.289 --> 03:29.459
<i>This is a move away</i>
<i>from the low profile that he's maintained</i>

03:29.542 --> 03:31.794
<i>since taking over back in February.</i>

03:31.878 --> 03:35.882
That's right, Matt. We haven't heard much
from Chief Tim Johnson publicly.

03:35.965 --> 03:40.053
But he says behind the scenes,
big developments are happening.

03:40.136 --> 03:43.514
Today, we got a glimpse
at what his officers are working on.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.893
If you commit a crime in Flint,
you're gonna get caught.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.519
[Jessica] <i>Here's the evidence.</i>

03:48.603 --> 03:53.775
<i>Literally $19,000 in cash,</i>
<i>14 guns, and bags full of drugs.</i>

03:53.858 --> 03:58.112
<i>This, seized from the streets in Flint</i>
<i>in just the last two weeks.</i>

03:58.196 --> 04:01.741
I'm gonna make Flint
a very uncomfortable place for criminals.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.285
[Jessica] <i>Mayor Karen Weaver,</i>
<i>who appointed this chief,</i>

04:04.369 --> 04:08.998
<i>says crime fighting will not take</i>
<i>a back seat to the water crisis.</i>

04:09.082 --> 04:13.127
Just like the residents deserve
clean, safe water,

04:13.211 --> 04:16.923
we also deserve to live
in a safe community.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.430
[officer] Yeah, we're here.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.059
[cop speaking indistinctly over radio]

04:28.142 --> 04:30.228
[cop over radio] <i>We're dealing with 6906.</i>

04:32.605 --> 04:35.566
[Kevin] Alright, you got four
walking north. North on York.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.652
I got three over here on York.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.574
I take it you're the runner
in that cruiser.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.994
[cop over radio] <i>No comment.</i>

04:48.037 --> 04:52.041
Somebody better be. Just letting
you guys know if you got my back.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.711
-Any drugs or weapons?
-[Alan] No drugs or weapons.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.255
-[Kevin] OK. Step out, buddy.
-[Alan] No drugs or weapons.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.090
[Kevin] Put your hands here for me.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.637
[Kevin] So you got money on you?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.889
Turn around for me.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.560
[Alan] Just money, man. No dope, no weed.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.687
[Kevin] I smell the weed. Do you smoke?

05:12.770 --> 05:14.147
[Alan] I've got a couple dollars.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.274
I did smoke weed.
It's my first day getting a car.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.859
-[Kevin] Whose car is it?
-My car.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.402
-[Kevin] Your name?
-Alan Sharp.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.946
-[Kevin] Where do I know you from?
-Flint. What did I do?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.741
[Kevin] Why are you worried?
Did I put you in handcuffs?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.285
-I've got C.A.T.T. Squad on me.
-[Kevin] That's what we do.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.369
We are C.A.T.T. Squad.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.705
-[Kevin] You got no license?
-I do.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.498
-[Kevin] Are you good?
-I'm good, sir.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.958
[Kevin] Then calm down and relax.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.711
-[Alan] What did I do, though?
-You didn't put your seatbelt on.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.171
-[Alan] OK.
-Yeah, that's all.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.090
You think I worry about that shit, man?
I've got to stop you.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.761
So look... Yeah, no, no.
I'm good with all that. So look...

05:44.844 --> 05:47.972
I'm sitting there and you put
your seatbelt on. So I pull you over.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.808
Then you try to hurry up
and get in the house.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.311
[Alan] It wasn't... It just be like...

05:53.394 --> 05:55.938
[officer]
Your actions led us to pull you over.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.357
Your drawers are unzipped.

05:58.441 --> 06:02.111
You know what threw me off? You got
two cars in the middle of the road.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.780
So when I got to the corner,

06:03.863 --> 06:06.824
that means shootout,
when you see two cars on a street.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.951
-No.
-[Alan] No, listen. That means...

06:09.035 --> 06:12.497
[officer] There are no shootouts in Flint.
We haven't had a shootout for ten years.

06:12.580 --> 06:17.960
The subway... You see two cars, that means
you all are looking for somebody.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.629
So the first thing I did was...

06:20.046 --> 06:23.633
I didn't have my seatbelt on.
This is my first day getting a car, man.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.803
We're not gonna ruin
your first day of getting the car.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.346
We're just doing our job.

06:28.429 --> 06:31.140
[Alan] And you got "C.A.T.T. Squad."
That shit got me nervous.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.684
-What's C.A.T.T. Squad?
-[Alan] I don't even know.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.686
It isn't regular cops.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.647
We are regular cops.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.690
-[Alan] You're regular...
-We got radios.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.401
We're the Flint Police.
See, it says "Flint."

06:42.485 --> 06:46.322
-[Alan] So what does C.A.T.T. stand for?
-Crime Area Target Team.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.866
[Alan] OK. Well, you just scared me.
You got two cars.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.786
-You could tell I was shocked.
-Yeah, man, you were.

06:51.869 --> 06:55.373
Are you sweating because you're scared
or because it's 80 degrees out?

06:55.456 --> 06:57.500
[Alan] Because it's 80 degrees out.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.003
I was in the A/C all day.
I just got off the highway 20 minutes ago.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.799
[Kevin] All your stuff's there.
You're good to go. Cool?

07:04.882 --> 07:07.009
-[Alan] You scared me.
-[Kevin] You're good, baby.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.427
[Alan] I'm gonna tell my boys...

07:12.932 --> 07:17.186
[Kevin] <i>With the water crisis, crime</i>
<i>in Flint and the staffing levels we have,</i>

07:17.270 --> 07:19.730
<i>there's no place in the world</i>
<i>that could compare</i>

07:19.814 --> 07:21.983
<i>with what we have to do on a daily basis.</i>

07:23.109 --> 07:25.236
<i>It takes a certain tough individual</i>

07:25.319 --> 07:28.489
<i>and somebody that knows Flint,</i>
<i>to police Flint.</i>

07:30.199 --> 07:33.077
There's no doubt,
whether next year or two years from now,

07:33.161 --> 07:35.246
crime is gonna be drastically dropped.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.915
And I think it's gonna be history.
I really do.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.918
The question is gonna be,
"How the hell did you guys do it?"

07:42.128 --> 07:44.547
Chief told us,
"I want you to hit these streets,

07:44.630 --> 07:46.966
hit them hard,
and I don't want you to play."

07:48.009 --> 07:50.261
<i>We have eight officers assigned to us.</i>

07:50.344 --> 07:52.305
<i>They are the cream of the crop.</i>

07:52.388 --> 07:55.349
They know drugs, they know guns.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.143
They know bad guys.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.689
[Keith] <i>Being born and raised in Flint,</i>
<i>with my knowledge of the community,</i>

08:01.772 --> 08:04.400
<i>I may see things</i>
<i>a little bit differently than you.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:06.277
I can look at a guy and say,

08:06.360 --> 08:09.405
in the way that he responds to me
if I'm in uniform,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.367
"Something's not right with this fellow."

08:13.451 --> 08:15.495
Or, "No, he's alright.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.623
He's just giving me the mean eye
because he's pissed."

08:19.165 --> 08:21.959
That's just one of them things
that really can't be taught.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.966
[Scott] <i>I grew up in this community.</i>
<i>I have family in this community.</i>

08:30.092 --> 08:31.719
I have friends.

08:33.095 --> 08:36.807
Who better, who better to keep
my community safe than me?

08:51.656 --> 08:54.909
[instructor] Everybody comfortable?
Everybody looks real good.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.204
Everybody toe this line right here
and face down range.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.623
Let's hunker down closely right here.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.710
When I say draw, just come out
and present to the target.

09:04.794 --> 09:05.795
Draw.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.965
Holster.

09:10.216 --> 09:14.887
We see a lot of people come up and shoot,
and then go right back to the holster.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.181
What's the point?
There may be other threats. There may be more people
that you can't see,

09:19.559 --> 09:22.812
so you come up, you address the threat,
and then you scan.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.773
You can scan and take your weapon
and eyes at the same time, or move your head and then go
to the threat with your weapon.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.778
Draw.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.698
Holster.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.285
Draw.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.789
The first gun I used was a used gun,

09:42.206 --> 09:45.710
so we went to the range,
loaded my ammo in the magazine,

09:47.169 --> 09:50.590
and when I went to shoot,
and I cocked it, it wouldn't shoot.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.301
<i>The trigger was pulling,</i>
<i>but there was nothing coming out.</i>

09:53.384 --> 09:57.722
I was like, "What the heck?" So I tilted
the gun halfway up, at an angle,

09:57.805 --> 09:58.973
and the gun fired.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.182
[gunshot]

10:02.476 --> 10:04.312
I was, like,
"I don't want to mess with guns."

10:04.395 --> 10:06.439
But then I got talked back into it.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.528
[low booming]

10:19.076 --> 10:22.788
It was kind of scary knowing
that I am holding a weapon that,

10:22.872 --> 10:25.750
if I pull the trigger
it could take someone's life away.

10:25.833 --> 10:29.378
So, I was scared. I didn't want
to point the gun in any direction.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.799
<i>After my first three or four shots</i>
<i>I felt more comfortable</i>

10:34.467 --> 10:36.469
<i>with how to handle it.</i>

10:38.012 --> 10:41.015
It was pretty cool.
My first time shooting a gun ever.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.979
[instructor] You're about
to embark on a journey.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.981
People may potentially try to kill you,

10:49.065 --> 10:52.193
and you need to be proficient
with your firearms.

10:52.526 --> 10:56.030
They're very high liability tasks,
and you're not gonna do it very often.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.032
You'll come to the range once a year.

10:58.115 --> 11:01.535
Do it on your own. Go shoot.
Draw, holster, all those things.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.246
It will help you.
It will help you survive an encounter.

11:04.330 --> 11:09.001
Hopefully that doesn't happen, but in
a dangerous town the likelihood is there.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.506
[Dion] <i>It is intense,</i>

11:13.589 --> 11:17.176
<i>especially with the stuff in the media</i>
<i>about police killing other people.</i>

11:19.011 --> 11:21.889
I understand them being upset
about law enforcement,

11:21.972 --> 11:24.809
but that's probably gonna be
the hardest part:

11:24.892 --> 11:29.438
trying to handle people that have
no respect for the police at all.

11:31.399 --> 11:35.778
[tense music playing]

11:35.861 --> 11:40.157
[siren wailing]

11:46.664 --> 11:49.083
[Kevin] Wilks, come here, man.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.544
I told you, stay over here.
Dump that out.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.088
-[Wilkes] OK, you told me.
-[Kevin] You're going with me.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.717
Put him in handcuffs. He's going to jail.
I told you, zero tolerance here.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.512
You think I'm playing with you?
I'm not playing with you.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.098
-You're gonna realize it real soon.
-Yes, sir.

12:05.015 --> 12:08.644
[fireworks crackling]

12:21.240 --> 12:25.619
I know the unit is a crime fighting unit,
and it's not gonna make everybody happy.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.872
A lot of times it's gonna piss people off.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.417
Being in C.A.T.T., to me, is like
neighborhood policing, to be honest,

12:31.500 --> 12:35.421
because a lot of the places that we go,
someone called about that area.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.299
You know, you got
the old lady on the block

12:38.382 --> 12:41.051
that sees someone selling dope
in front of her house.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.889
And all she want to do is get it
checked out. She want it to stop.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.141
We can't make everybody happy.

12:47.224 --> 12:51.520
Actually, this is the only job
that we can't make everybody happy.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.441
So, if you got the community
and the police department at odds,

12:55.524 --> 12:56.901
the police isn't shit.

12:58.694 --> 13:02.281
[pounding music playing]

13:04.992 --> 13:09.205
[police speaking indistinctly over radio]

13:11.040 --> 13:14.126
[siren wailing]

13:19.757 --> 13:22.426
-[woman] This is my car.
-[Esther] It will be at the impound lot.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.429
He was driving like a knucklehead.
It's part of the crime.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.890
This is not how you drive.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.644
-It looked like...
-Is this a road? Is this a road?

13:31.727 --> 13:34.355
-I know it's not a road.
-Is it involved in a crash?

13:34.438 --> 13:37.691
I'm just asking you a question.
Why are you so hostile with me?

13:37.775 --> 13:40.027
[Esther] I answered your question, hon.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.154
But when I ask you a question,
you can't answer it.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.949
[Esther] I answered. It'll be impounded.
It's part of the crime.

13:45.032 --> 13:48.285
Does this look like it needs
to be driven up here into a porch?

13:48.369 --> 13:51.247
-That's driving like a knucklehead.
-[woman] It had to keep going.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.040
[woman] Somebody can drive it off.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.252
[Esther] There's no one to drive it off.
It's not getting driven off.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.504
-It's getting towed.
-But I'm here, though.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.549
Doesn't matter. You're not listening.
I'm explaining to you.

14:01.632 --> 14:05.261
They say if there's somebody present
to drive the car off...

14:05.344 --> 14:08.222
-Who said that?
-A police officer told me this.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.516
-I'm the sergeant.
-A police officer told me.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.768
I'm the sergeant. It's not getting driven.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.229
She already told you, but you're...

14:15.312 --> 14:18.899
-You're trying to tell her, her job.
-[woman] I asked her a question.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.069
-You're getting nothing out of that car.
-[woman] My ID is in that purse.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.114
If I get pulled over,
I'm gonna go to jail for not having an ID.

14:25.197 --> 14:29.618
-[Esther] The answer is no.
-[woman #2] Don't talk to her, Keyla.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.911
Stop. She's white.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.413
She can do whatever she wants.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.498
Let's not give that up. Just wait.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.458
Just wait. Just wait.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.711
All of them are white. Just wait.

14:38.794 --> 14:42.631
-Are they?
-[woman #2] It's the truth, though.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.302
[Esther] You might want to get your phone
out and see if they're all white.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.722
[woman #2] She's recording it there.
Don't talk to them.

14:49.805 --> 14:50.806
[Esther] Ignorance.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.270
We got a right to voice our fucking
opinion as long as we fucking want to.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.230
And you can't stop that shit.

14:58.898 --> 15:03.110
You think you can instigate anything
because she's white.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.445
Stop.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.575
[Esther] <i>I think she picked me out because</i>
<i>she thought I was the weak one.</i>

15:09.658 --> 15:12.077
<i>Honestly. Because it's happened a lot.</i>

15:12.494 --> 15:16.749
I've earned my bitch-wings over 22 years.
I've earned my respect.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.961
I felt at the beginning of my career
I treated black people differently,

15:21.045 --> 15:22.504
only to be nicer,

15:22.588 --> 15:26.050
because I was afraid of how I would look
if I treated them any differently.

15:26.133 --> 15:30.220
That turned into treating them different
than I would treat somebody else.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.642
I would take more abuse from them verbally
than I would somebody else,

15:34.725 --> 15:36.393
as opposed to shutting it down.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.605
Now, it doesn't matter what color you are.
It's getting shut down.

15:39.688 --> 15:40.898
I don't care who you are.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.946
<i>And as soon as she got angry,</i>
<i>she brought up race.</i>

15:48.113 --> 15:50.824
The community likes to make it the issue
more than we do.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.118
We don't bring it up.
It's brought up by them.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.412
[woman] I know, they say...

15:55.496 --> 15:57.957
Way to go! You got
the whole neighborhood awake.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.042
Hey. C.A.T.T. squad. [phone rings]

16:13.847 --> 16:17.768
[Kris] Hey, we're on Lippincott right now,
heading eastbound.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.815
Alright. We're going to the Regency, then.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.820
Regency's gonna be something to see, man.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.781
-Remember going to calls at the Regency?
-[Kevin] Yeah.

16:32.116 --> 16:35.661
[Kris] Five, six o'clock in the morning,
everybody is up.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.621
Nobody sleeps. It's like daylight.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.462
You better let them know
we're coming.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.673
Yeah, you better take off!

16:49.466 --> 16:50.467
Stop. [Kevin] Come here, man.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.473
[Kris] What you got?
What you reaching for?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.517
Let me see your hands.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.810
Let me see your hands!

17:00.519 --> 17:03.272
-You smoke weed with a kid in the car?
-No, man.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.233
[Kris] No, what? Dump that out, smash it.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.819
Hurry up. I'm in a hurry.
Get that baby out of here.

17:11.946 --> 17:13.699
You two, get out the way.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.412
[Kevin] Oh, man, better watch out.
We got a marathon going here.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.039
Get them!

17:25.002 --> 17:26.295
[officer] You know what I mean?

17:26.377 --> 17:29.089
[woman] We just came off work
at Church's Chicken.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.051
OK. Alright.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.097
When they first hit the streets,

17:37.181 --> 17:40.726
it was one of those things where
the conversations were in barber shops about this team out here harassing people.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.023
What are you looking for?

17:46.106 --> 17:50.110
When I see the police,
they make me want to take off running,

17:50.194 --> 17:53.072
whether I did something wrong or not.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.741
I have a son and it makes me emotional,

17:55.824 --> 18:01.163
because, you know,
it makes me afraid for him to grow up.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.792
The policemen aren't fair sometimes.
Life is really not fair.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.711
-If police tell me to shut up...
-Whatever they ask, do it.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.922
I'm not gonna think about
what my rights are.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.424
-"Yes, sir. No, sir."
-I'm gonna shut up.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.510
Just do it.
Just do whatever they say.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.221
Lay on the ground.
Let them pat you down. Just do it.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.139
How can you trust the police?

18:19.223 --> 18:23.769
If you see this on TV, you see this online
or whatever you see, I mean...

18:24.603 --> 18:27.106
How can you trust
the police these days?

18:27.189 --> 18:28.398
How can you?

18:46.375 --> 18:48.710
[Dion] Got my socks and my shoes.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.005
Got my pants under here, my tie...

18:52.548 --> 18:53.924
I believe that's it.

18:57.094 --> 19:01.098
[Jazmin] <i>Well, when I first met Dion</i>
<i>he was into football and basketball,</i>

19:01.181 --> 19:04.393
<i>but he always talked about,</i>
<i>like, growing up and being a cop.</i>

19:05.519 --> 19:09.606
He loves Flint. He knows all the streets,
he feels comfortable there.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.901
<i>When he said he was gonna be</i>
<i>a Flint police officer,</i>

19:12.985 --> 19:15.779
<i>where it was</i>
<i>didn't cross my mind at the time,</i>

19:15.863 --> 19:18.323
<i>because I knew he was so excited about it.</i>

19:18.407 --> 19:21.910
That's all I was thinking.
"He's gonna be a cop. He's gonna be fine.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.787
He's the good guy out there."

19:24.955 --> 19:28.000
<i>Our daughter was born</i>
<i>January 10th of 2015.</i>

19:29.334 --> 19:32.045
<i>When she was born,</i>
<i>he was actually away at college.</i>

19:32.129 --> 19:34.047
<i>He would come home on the weekends.</i>

19:34.506 --> 19:38.844
He wanted to be home with her
and he wanted to get a job and spoil her,

19:38.927 --> 19:40.387
so that's what he did!

19:44.141 --> 19:46.226
-[Jazmin] You out?
-[Dion] I'm out.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.812
-I love you.
-Love you. See you later.

19:48.896 --> 19:49.730
[Dion] Text me.

19:49.813 --> 19:53.066
I can't text you, obviously,
but I want a text when I get off.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.694
-OK.
-[Dion] Alright. I love you.

19:55.777 --> 19:56.820
[Jazmin] Love you.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.582
[drill sergeant] Order arms!

20:09.082 --> 20:11.210
-[drill sergeant] Nelson? Cole?
-Sir, here, sir.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.837
-D. Reed. M. Reed.
-Sir, here, sir.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.423
[Maria] <i>It's something</i>
<i>he's always wanted to do,</i>

20:16.506 --> 20:19.176
<i>and I never pictured us</i>
<i>going through it together.</i>

20:19.259 --> 20:20.928
[drill sergeant] Right face.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.389
[Maria] <i>People ask,</i>
<i>"What's it gonna be like working with him?</i>

20:24.473 --> 20:28.060
What happens if you hear a call go out
and he's in a chase or something?"

20:28.143 --> 20:30.771
And I'm like, "He's a big boy."

20:31.730 --> 20:35.150
<i>I know how I raised him, so he knows</i>
<i>he's got to take care of his self.</i>

20:35.692 --> 20:38.070
I have, at night, thought about, you know,

20:38.153 --> 20:40.447
"What happens
if something happens to Dion?"

20:41.657 --> 20:44.826
<i>I kind of get that nervous feeling</i>
<i>and so forth in me.</i>

20:46.954 --> 20:49.998
I don't want to think
how I would feel about it, right now.

20:52.876 --> 20:58.757
[marching band music playing]

21:08.267 --> 21:10.769
Our keynote address speaker this morning

21:10.852 --> 21:13.438
will be Flint Police Chief
Timothy Johnson.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.774
[applause]

21:15.857 --> 21:17.401
Good morning, everyone.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.154
Well, I've just got to say,
better you than me!

21:22.364 --> 21:24.199
I remember those days.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.202
That's a nice-looking group,

21:27.286 --> 21:29.871
and I'm proud to stand before you
and welcome you

21:29.955 --> 21:33.041
to the career field of law enforcement.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.044
I applaud you guys
for taking on this task,

21:36.128 --> 21:37.671
because it's not an easy one.

21:37.754 --> 21:41.133
Your family is gonna have to understand
that you have a job out there,

21:41.216 --> 21:43.927
and when you come home,
you might not be in the best mood.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.681
You know, we have one of the highest
divorce rates among officers.

21:47.764 --> 21:51.560
Did they tell you that in the academy?
That's a true statement.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.231
[instructor] Now is the time
you've all been waiting for.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.276
The diplomas.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.652
Will you all stand, please?

22:02.446 --> 22:06.742
From the City of Flint Police Department,
Maria Reed.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.494
[applause]

22:10.954 --> 22:14.708
From the Flint City Police Department,
Dion Reed.

22:15.625 --> 22:19.671
As a side note here,
Maria is Dion's mother.

22:20.881 --> 22:25.135
It's a first for our academy,
but they both did an awesome job.

22:25.218 --> 22:29.514
[applause]

22:32.059 --> 22:34.770
And on behalf
of the recruits or the officers now...

22:35.270 --> 22:36.104
[man whoops]

22:36.188 --> 22:39.149
[all] Sir, as a law enforcement officer,

22:39.232 --> 22:41.943
my fundamental duty
is to serve the community.

22:42.444 --> 22:47.574
I will maintain courageous calm
in the face of danger, scorn, or ridicule,

22:47.657 --> 22:51.953
develop self-restraint, and be constantly
mindful of the welfare of others,

22:52.370 --> 22:55.040
never employing unnecessary force
or violence,

22:55.415 --> 22:57.584
dedicating myself before God

22:57.667 --> 23:00.629
to my chosen profession,
law enforcement, sir.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.801
[cheering]

23:08.678 --> 23:10.972
[Dion] <i>Right now, it's still shocking,</i>

23:11.056 --> 23:13.809
<i>because I didn't think</i>
<i>I was gonna be here at this age.</i> In the police academy,
you act like you're saving lives,

23:17.437 --> 23:20.065
but it's a whole new experience,
saying I'm a police officer.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.277
<i>It's the real deal.</i>

23:25.403 --> 23:29.991
[tense music playing]

23:30.075 --> 23:34.246
Flint police are now cracking down
on trespassing at convenience stores.

23:34.704 --> 23:38.250
[reporter] <i>Last September,</i>
<i>five people shot outside of Liquor Plus.</i>

[Tim] <i>We got a lot of complaints</i>
<i>on that store.</i>

23:54.015 --> 23:57.394
Any time you have a group of guys
hanging out on a corner like that,

23:58.019 --> 23:59.771
that's nothing but trouble.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.317
So, you disperse them,
you move them along,

24:04.401 --> 24:07.779
and you keep them off those corners,
and you keep the shootings down.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.742
[cop speaking indistinctly over radio]

24:18.165 --> 24:20.917
[Scott] Hey, watch the one
that's going in the store, also.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.172
Grab the wall for me.
Spread your legs for me.

24:25.255 --> 24:29.134
Right now you could be under arrest
for loitering, OK?

24:29.467 --> 24:31.261
Pull your pants up. You're a grown man.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.139
Know what I'm saying?
You can't be doing that, brother.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.058
-[officer] He hasn't got no ID.
-[Scott] You got ID on you?

24:37.142 --> 24:39.728
-Here. Give me an ink pen.
-[officer] Like that...

24:40.395 --> 24:41.980
He's got no ID on him.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.566
[man] I can call somebody
to come pick me up.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.819
You've got to be gone, man.
You're by yourself. Get out of here.

24:49.196 --> 24:53.200
If you had a warning, what do you think
it would be for? If you had one.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.576
Nothing?

24:55.452 --> 24:58.079
I'm gonna put it out there. It's hot.

24:58.163 --> 25:01.791
Anybody up in this store.
And we want to arrest the owner.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.128
-That's how bad it is.
-[man] Shit, I'm just...

25:05.503 --> 25:06.922
That's how bad it is.

<i>no longer a convenience, but a risk.</i>

25:15.222 --> 25:17.098
They start with the parking lots.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.975
I think the city will be better,

25:19.059 --> 25:21.811
and more people will bring
more opportunities here.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.106
Meantime, Grand Rapids
has a similar ordinance,

and they were sued by the ACLU
who said this unfairly targets minorities.

25:34.199 --> 25:38.453
[tense music playing]

25:40.413 --> 25:42.791
Go through there and cut that mess down.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.307
[Scott] Hey, my man, let me talk to you.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.729
How long are you gonna keep
playing these games?

26:04.813 --> 26:05.939
[shopkeeper] What games?

26:06.022 --> 26:08.066
[Scott] A man bought
a single cigarette from you.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.652
How long are you gonna keep
playing these games?

26:11.111 --> 26:14.781
I'll be real with you.
I'll be 100 with you.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.660
Here's the problem.
You are selling singles, OK?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.870
And selling liquor after two o'clock.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.248
I've left it alone
because you had some issues.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.542
-[shopkeeper] I'm not the boss.
-It don't matter.

26:26.042 --> 26:28.295
-Do us a favor.
-[shopkeeper] I won't do it.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.506
Listen to me. That comes on you,
because you're part of this.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.758
-[shopkeeper] I will leave...
-It doesn't matter.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.387
Listen, my partner wants to be nice.
I don't want to be nice to you.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.556
Because you've been warned
too many times.

26:39.639 --> 26:44.311
I should lock you up tonight,
and let your boss bond you out.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.272
You don't care because
you don't live in this neighborhood.

26:47.689 --> 26:51.234
When you leave M L King and Dayton,
guess where you go?

26:51.860 --> 26:55.113
Back home to Grand Blanc,
or Owosso or somewhere like that.

26:55.488 --> 26:59.117
-No, I live in Mount Morris.
-But you don't live in the city of Flint.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.786
You are part of the problem. Hear me out.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.372
I don't care. You're part of the problem.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.292
[Kevin] All the problems
are because of everything going on here.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.960
-It's your last time.
-I won't do it.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.962
Words don't mean nothing.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.547
Your word don't mean anything.

27:12.630 --> 27:17.093
I guarantee you, next time, I'm taking you
with me, and I'm gonna padlock your store.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.721
I guarantee you that. Promise you.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.564
[moody electronic music playing]

27:33.318 --> 27:37.781
[background chatter]

27:48.249 --> 27:51.419
Every time they see two black people
in a car, what do they do?

27:51.503 --> 27:55.090
Pull them over.
Have no probable cause, no reason.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.509
They ask you,
"Where are the guns and drugs?"

27:57.592 --> 28:00.011
Why do you assume I got guns and drugs?

28:00.762 --> 28:02.722
I just get, "Where you work at?"

28:02.806 --> 28:05.392
What does that have to do
with this traffic stop?

28:06.059 --> 28:09.145
Why does where I'm going
have anything to do with anything?

28:09.229 --> 28:10.939
[man] Like I said, they're scared.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.941
They just come up with BS, man,

28:13.024 --> 28:15.819
and that's why we don't like them
and don't trust them.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.696
[man] We have to educate folk.

28:18.780 --> 28:22.367
Without education,
you won't have self-esteem.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.286
You won't know that you're important.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.415
You won't know
that you have a responsibility.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.626
There's so many things that you won't know

28:31.709 --> 28:34.254
that put you
into the animalistic behavior

28:34.337 --> 28:37.215
of just, "me, me, and me."

28:37.799 --> 28:39.718
-Can I get an amen?
-Amen.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.679
That's all I want to hear.
That's the preacher.

28:44.222 --> 28:47.559
Let me ask you this.
Say you grew up on a farm, right?

28:47.642 --> 28:51.646
You're not used to young dudes
with pistols and black neighborhoods.

28:51.730 --> 28:56.943
You only see black people from what
you see on social media or the news or TV.

28:57.402 --> 29:01.406
You ride through this dark neighborhood
that's known with a high crime rate,

29:01.489 --> 29:04.033
it looks like a damn jungle to you, right?

29:04.117 --> 29:06.536
And this black man jumps out
with a hoodie on.

29:06.619 --> 29:09.831
-I think they're more scared than us.
-That's what it is.

29:10.290 --> 29:14.210
You have to address that.
See, that's where instruction comes in.

29:14.294 --> 29:18.590
If you're educated, you know everybody
isn't gonna be like you, so that's racist?

29:19.924 --> 29:21.718
No, it's not racism. It's culture.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.472
Everybody's culture is different.

29:25.889 --> 29:29.642
And God made us all different cultures
to get His glory,

29:29.726 --> 29:32.687
not to run around here
and call each other racist.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.860
[man] Yeah. Amen.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.862
-[man #2] Can I get an amen?
-[all] Amen.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.405
[man #2] OK, I'm out!

29:43.364 --> 29:44.866
I love you, man.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.977
[Kevin] Alright.
I'll text you in one second.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.193
[siren wailing]

30:20.819 --> 30:23.488
-[Scott] He won't stop?
-[Kevin] Put him right there.

30:23.571 --> 30:25.949
Put him... right here.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.665
[siren wailing]

30:34.707 --> 30:36.709
Oh, he's gone all the way
into the driveway, huh?

30:44.676 --> 30:47.387
[officer] Get out. Turn around.
Hands on your back.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.430
[man] How you doing?

30:49.514 --> 30:51.140
-You live here?
-Yes.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.270
-Did you see the lights and sirens?
-Yes, I did. I was just...

30:55.353 --> 30:57.021
-You just what?
-I thought...

30:57.105 --> 30:59.065
-What?
-I'd let you know that I live here.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.192
So what kept you from stopping back there?

31:02.318 --> 31:03.528
Nothing.

31:03.611 --> 31:05.989
You live here?
What does that have to do with it?

31:06.072 --> 31:07.907
-How old are you?
-Twenty-two.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.952
Have you ever been involved
in a traffic stop?

31:11.035 --> 31:11.995
Yes.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.289
What are you supposed to do
in a traffic stop?

31:14.372 --> 31:16.124
When the lights come on, pull over.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.751
So you making it home,
what does that got to do with it?

31:18.835 --> 31:20.420
Stand over there, please.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.131
Go back over there, please, sir.
Thank you.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.258
-What are you supposed to do?
-Pull over.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.468
-So, did you pull over?
-No, sir.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.138
-Why not?
-I made a bad decision.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.640
You made a bad decision?
Now you got to pay for it.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.519
We don't know what you got
or why you didn't stop.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.317
-Where's your license at?
-[man] In the house.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.277
[Scott] Oh. You're under arrest.

31:46.529 --> 31:49.073
[man #2] That's my cousin.
I was following him.

31:49.157 --> 31:52.035
[Scott] Yeah, he's terrible.
He's gonna pay for that mistake.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.203
He's gonna pay dearly for that mistake.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.623
-You're gonna keep him?
-[Scott] I'm gonna lock him up.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.708
I'm gonna take his car and lock him up.

31:58.791 --> 32:02.462
-Yeah, but this is his crib.
-It won't be tonight. I'm taking this car.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.675
That was very dangerous what you did.
I'm thinking you got a gun.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.053
What if we would have shot you,

32:10.595 --> 32:12.680
based on what you just did?

32:13.848 --> 32:16.059
I know you saw me
when I jumped out of my car

32:16.142 --> 32:18.311
and ran up there to the driver's side.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.105
Yeah, with my hand on my gun.

32:22.398 --> 32:25.485
And first thing,
if something violent happened to you,

32:25.568 --> 32:28.154
then we got everybody crying
about "My baby got killed."

32:28.237 --> 32:31.783
But guess what, their baby didn't do
what they're supposed to.

32:33.993 --> 32:37.205
It doesn't make any sense.
Anything could have happened.

32:38.581 --> 32:40.583
[dispatcher indistinctly over radio]

32:40.667 --> 32:42.543
How long have you been
working at that job?

32:43.836 --> 32:44.921
Going on three years?

32:46.839 --> 32:48.007
[man] Yes, sir.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.844
Alright, I'm gonna let you go.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.722
You pull that again, brother,
you're going to jail. Understand me?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.183
And I'm gonna take your car.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.560
You understand?

33:02.105 --> 33:04.524
This is your last warning
you'll get from us.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.069
Come on out.

33:09.445 --> 33:14.450
[soft ambient music playing]

33:30.675 --> 33:33.594
[chattering]

33:33.678 --> 33:38.891
[officer] Alright, guys. Have you heard
about the shooting yesterday in Minnesota?

33:38.975 --> 33:41.978
-Heard about it.
-[sergeant] We're gonna watch the video. It's kind of long,
but we're gonna watch the whole thing.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.071
This one?

33:54.073 --> 33:55.575
[woman] <i>Stay with me.</i>

33:55.658 --> 33:58.494
<i>We got pulled over</i>
<i>for a busted tail light in the back.</i>

33:59.203 --> 34:02.206
And the police just... He's covered.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.375
He killed my boyfriend.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.462
He's licensed. He's licensed to carry.

34:07.545 --> 34:12.091
He was trying to get out his ID
and his wallet out of his pocket.

34:12.175 --> 34:16.137
<i>And he let the officer know</i>
<i>that he was...</i>

34:16.971 --> 34:19.431
<i>he had a firearm</i>
<i>and he was reaching for his wallet,</i>

34:19.891 --> 34:22.768
<i>and the officer just shot him in his arm.</i>

34:22.851 --> 34:26.147
-[officer] Keep your hands where they are!
-I will, sir, no worries.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.815
[officer screams] Fuck!

34:27.899 --> 34:30.193
[woman] He just shot his arm off.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.820
<i>We got pulled over on Larpenteur.</i>

34:32.904 --> 34:35.864
[officer] <i>I told him not to reach for it.</i>
<i>I told him to get his hand off it!</i>

34:35.947 --> 34:39.494
[woman] <i>You told him to get his ID, sir.</i>
<i>His driver's license.</i>

34:39.577 --> 34:41.996
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>please don't tell me he's dead.</i>

34:43.164 --> 34:45.792
<i>Please don't tell me</i>
<i>my boyfriend just went like that.</i>

34:45.875 --> 34:49.462
-[officer] <i>Keep your hands where they are.</i>
-[woman] <i>Yes, I will, sir.</i>

34:50.880 --> 34:54.257
[woman] <i>Please don't tell me this, Lord.</i>
<i>Jesus, don't tell me that he's gone.</i>

34:54.717 --> 34:56.761
<i>Please, don't tell me that he's gone.</i>

34:56.844 --> 34:59.597
<i>Please, officer, don't tell me</i>
<i>that you just did this to him.</i>

35:00.139 --> 35:02.600
<i>You shot four bullets into him, sir.</i>

35:02.683 --> 35:06.104
<i>You got the Rosedale Police.</i>
<i>They got me handcuffed.</i>

35:06.187 --> 35:08.439
<i>My phone is about to die.</i>

35:08.523 --> 35:10.608
<i>We had a busted tail light.</i>

35:11.859 --> 35:14.278
<i>And we have some weed in the car.</i>
<i>That's about it.</i>

35:14.529 --> 35:15.655
[officer] Oh...

35:16.447 --> 35:17.949
[woman] <i>The phone is about to die.</i>

35:18.491 --> 35:20.952
<i>Don't be scared.</i>
<i>My daughter just witnessed this.</i>

35:23.746 --> 35:27.667
<i>The police just shot him</i>
<i>for no apparent reason.</i>

35:28.417 --> 35:30.086
<i>No reason at all.</i>

35:31.462 --> 35:33.005
[woman weeps]

35:34.006 --> 35:36.843
[sergeant] One person at a time.
Let's keep our comments brief.

35:37.468 --> 35:40.763
But... any thoughts, anybody?

35:41.597 --> 35:44.851
-This just happened today?
-Yesterday. I heard yesterday.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.937
I mean, this just goes
like any other time.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.565
This is one side of what happened.

35:50.648 --> 35:55.153
I mean, months from now,
we'll find out the full report, so...

35:56.320 --> 35:58.156
-Did he end up passing away?
-[officer] Yes.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.324
He did? So, OK, he's dead.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.954
It's unfortunate
that this lady lost her boyfriend,

36:05.037 --> 36:08.082
and you have a four-year-old girl
that saw her father die

36:08.166 --> 36:09.584
right in front of her.

36:09.959 --> 36:14.422
The only thing I can comment on
is my experiences over 20 years.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.966
And the way
that cop's adrenaline was going

36:17.049 --> 36:18.551
and the way he was still...

36:19.218 --> 36:23.055
The reason why he's still pointing
that gun at a guy who is not moving,

36:23.139 --> 36:24.974
is because that cop is scared.

36:25.349 --> 36:29.395
I don't think that officer wishes
to be in the situation that he's in,

36:29.478 --> 36:31.731
because he's gonna be crucified
in the news.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.067
-Justified or not.
-[officer] Right.

36:35.151 --> 36:39.280
[Esther] And in a court's mind, it's how
a reasonable officer would have reacted.

36:39.363 --> 36:43.284
We don't know what happened in that car.
I'm not gonna comment on the shooting.

36:43.367 --> 36:47.788
What if you assume that the guy
did say, "Hey, I've got a CPL"?

36:47.872 --> 36:49.624
I think he probably did tell him.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.084
But to me, she says something really key.

36:52.710 --> 36:56.547
She mentions that the officer shot
when he was bringing his hands back up.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.966
His hands were down
where they shouldn't have been.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.511
Normally, what I do is,

37:02.595 --> 37:06.682
"Hey, keep your hands
where I can see them," you know?

37:06.766 --> 37:09.477
Because if he starts reaching,
I don't know his intent.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.688
-Nobody knows what this guy's intent is.
-[officer #2] Exactly.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.857
I mean, he could be
the nicest guy on Sunday,

37:14.941 --> 37:16.484
and today is a bad day.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.945
You know what I'm saying?
What are you gonna do?

37:20.238 --> 37:24.408
One of the things to think about is,
her boyfriend just got shot by the police,

37:24.492 --> 37:27.495
and her first reaction is to take out
her cell phone and record.

37:27.578 --> 37:31.040
-And she was pretty callous about it.
-[officer] Calm.

37:31.123 --> 37:34.460
That's probably the worst situation
you can be in,

37:34.543 --> 37:37.338
and her first thought
is to get her cell phone out.

37:37.838 --> 37:41.634
Assume you're always being recorded.
Don't let it change your tactics.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.720
[Esther] You know, use your heads. Think.

37:44.804 --> 37:49.225
There's no shame in retreating until
you've got the ability to secure a scene.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.769
Take cover.
Don't stand in front of that window.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.104
[sergeant] Ready to roll?

37:53.562 --> 37:56.107
-Let's hit it.
-[Esther] Let's do it.

38:02.655 --> 38:06.033
[Robert] <i>It would really appear</i>
<i>that people are going out of their way</i> <i>to shine a negative light on police,</i>
<i>at this point, for some reason.</i>

38:11.539 --> 38:14.542
<i>That officer, he's standing there</i>
<i>in the window yelling, "fuck."</i>

38:14.625 --> 38:17.461
-I will, sir. No worries.
-[officer screams] Fuck!

38:18.045 --> 38:20.339
[Robert] <i>He's not just saying "fuck."</i>
<i>He's screaming.</i>

38:20.923 --> 38:26.012
<i>Because all he can see at that point</i>
<i>is the fact that he just shot somebody,</i>

38:26.512 --> 38:28.931
<i>which is actually a pretty big deal.</i>

38:30.349 --> 38:33.894
When you pull that trigger,
I mean, that's...

38:33.978 --> 38:35.688
It doesn't get any bigger than that.

38:39.608 --> 38:43.654
There is so much that happened
before that thing actually kicked on,

38:43.738 --> 38:46.907
and that's even if what we saw
wasn't even edited.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.994
Because as we know, if you go back
to the Rodney King days,

38:50.077 --> 38:51.871
that video actually was cut...

38:52.955 --> 38:56.208
showing just the last part of it
and not the beginning of it.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.715
And every time I look at that,
I'm just, like...

39:04.050 --> 39:05.926
"That was horrible."

39:06.844 --> 39:08.554
It was horrible police work.

39:08.637 --> 39:10.181
I mean, it was...

39:13.017 --> 39:16.187
You actually see it with your own eyes.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.275
And it's like the world...

39:21.359 --> 39:23.903
well, when I say the world,
the black community,

39:23.986 --> 39:26.864
has never forgotten things like that.

39:28.574 --> 39:32.411
<i>It's almost like nobody thought</i>
<i>to get down on the ground</i>

39:32.495 --> 39:33.996
<i>and try to handcuff him.</i>

39:34.080 --> 39:38.334
It's like, "Oh, he's still moving,"
you know? "Oh, he's still moving."

39:40.002 --> 39:44.632
At the point that you can control him
and handcuff him, it's done.

39:47.885 --> 39:52.264
If we're constantly reassessing the threat
and we determine, you know,

39:52.348 --> 39:55.768
that it's not appropriate
to shoot white people,

39:56.310 --> 40:01.399
that same courtesy should be extended
to all people, you know?

40:02.066 --> 40:04.360
And sometimes I look at it and I'm like,

40:05.319 --> 40:07.863
"They're not reassessing the threat."

40:08.948 --> 40:11.033
I'm minding my business.
Please, leave me alone.

40:12.284 --> 40:13.452
Don't touch me.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.085
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.129
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

40:26.132 --> 40:29.009
[Scott] <i>I don't think "I felt threatened"</i>

40:29.093 --> 40:32.221
<i>is a good enough answer</i>
<i>in these situations.</i>

40:33.180 --> 40:35.391
<i>Something has to click in your mind.</i>

40:35.474 --> 40:38.102
You have to constantly
reassess the threat.

40:43.524 --> 40:44.984
[gunshots]

40:47.069 --> 40:50.156
[man] <i>Seems like the '60s.</i>
<i>The '50s and the '60s.</i>

40:50.531 --> 40:53.951
It looks like it's coming back,
but they're getting away with it.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.578
They're getting away with it.

40:55.661 --> 40:58.539
That's what's real bad about it.
They're getting away with it.

40:59.039 --> 41:02.960
Really, this goes back...
It goes as far back as slavery, you know?

41:04.670 --> 41:07.006
There's a distrust there.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.216
Police is like...

41:09.967 --> 41:12.470
like the mailman, OK?

41:12.553 --> 41:15.723
They're walking down the street.
They see a dog barking.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.266
The dog may not bite them,

41:17.349 --> 41:21.770
but just because of the past,
what happened or what they've seen,

41:21.854 --> 41:23.939
they feel like that dog
is gonna bite them.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.817
They're gonna go around,
you know what I'm saying?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.944
They're scared of us. They fear us.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.988
I think some of it's fear,

41:31.071 --> 41:33.949
and not being comfortable
with where you're at.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.744
I think that comes into play quite a bit.

41:37.119 --> 41:41.999
It's sad that I have to tell my son,
"Look, just don't get into trouble,

41:42.082 --> 41:45.002
because you don't know if you have
a good cop or a bad cop."

41:45.085 --> 41:48.506
Now, how do you train out of that?
How do you fix that?

41:49.006 --> 41:49.924
How do you fix that?

41:50.007 --> 41:51.550
We could take a hundred classes,

41:51.634 --> 41:55.513
but if this dude grew up in a house where
Daddy didn't like fucking black people,

41:56.096 --> 41:57.681
how do you change that officer?

41:57.765 --> 41:58.849
That's...

41:59.600 --> 42:00.893
I don't know. That's tough.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.480
And until we stop sugarcoating
the issue in this country,

42:04.563 --> 42:07.191
that's the exact reason why
we're in the position that we're in.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.401
And they don't want
to deal with it head on.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.238
Until we start dealing
with these situations head on,

42:12.321 --> 42:14.073
we're gonna have these problems.

42:14.990 --> 42:17.368
[dispatcher] <i>Five-thirty,</i>
<i>around Dayton and King.</i>

42:17.952 --> 42:20.996
<i>Ten-four. Subject in position.</i>

42:21.705 --> 42:23.082
[Kevin] Chester, let's roll.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.838
[fireworks booming]

42:32.967 --> 42:35.886
[Kevin] Four males with guns
across from the store, at the southwest corner
in a black Ford Fusion.

42:39.473 --> 42:41.392
-Do you see a black Ford Fusion?
-No...

42:42.184 --> 42:43.185
Right there.

42:45.145 --> 42:49.316
[tense music playing]
