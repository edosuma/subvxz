00:03.569 --> 00:06.270
Did you hear what
samantha said in english?

00:06.271 --> 00:08.306
She told me she liked him.
She likes him?

00:08.307 --> 00:09.307
Hi.
Yeah.

00:09.308 --> 00:10.942
Hi.

00:12.745 --> 00:15.146
Uh, this is
my friend ashley.
Hi, ashley.

00:15.147 --> 00:17.048
Hi.
She's gonna study with me.

00:17.049 --> 00:18.549
Yeah, we've got, like,

00:18.550 --> 00:21.152
A really big
history test coming up.

00:21.153 --> 00:27.025
Oh. Well, here, let me
clear this table and you
can, like, use it.

00:27.026 --> 00:32.063
No, it's ok. We decided to
study in my room.

00:32.064 --> 00:35.634
Make sure you, like,
leave the door open, ok?

00:35.635 --> 00:37.836
<i>(phone rings)</i>

00:40.539 --> 00:44.475
Hello?
Yes, it is.

00:44.476 --> 00:48.113
Reunion? What reunion?

00:48.114 --> 00:51.916
No, I never got
an invitation.

00:51.917 --> 00:55.520
I haven't lived there
in 15 years.

00:55.521 --> 00:58.623
Oh, gosh.
It's next Saturday?

00:58.624 --> 01:01.159
I don't know if I can
get it together that fast.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.527
I have to make
hotel reservations,

01:02.528 --> 01:05.063
Plane reservations,
lose ten pounds...

01:06.532 --> 01:09.634
Look, I'll tell you what.
Can I call you back tomorrow?

01:09.635 --> 01:12.303
What's your number?
Ok.

01:12.304 --> 01:13.504
Bye-bye.

01:13.505 --> 01:15.239
Hi.
Hi.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.142
You will never guess what
I just found out.

01:17.143 --> 01:21.612
My high-school reunion
is next Saturday in washington.

01:21.613 --> 01:25.850
Has it been
50 years already?

01:25.851 --> 01:29.888
20. You know what?
I think I wanna go.

01:29.889 --> 01:32.356
We just have to find somebody
to stay with the kids.

01:32.357 --> 01:33.758
I'll stay.

01:35.460 --> 01:38.797
No way! I went to your reunion,
you're going to mine.

01:38.798 --> 01:41.599
You were miserable at
my reunion. You spent
the whole night by yourself.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.501
And why was that?
Because you and your friends

01:43.502 --> 01:47.872
Spent the whole night
mooning your old principal.

01:47.873 --> 01:51.309
I think she enjoyed it.

01:51.310 --> 01:55.080
You are going with me.
I thought you hated
your high school.

01:55.081 --> 01:58.249
I loved this high school.
I hated joanie graham.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.753
Well, joanie the phony could
be there. You wanna risk it?

02:01.754 --> 02:03.688
I don't care
if she is there.

02:03.689 --> 02:05.423
She kept me away from
my high-school prom.

02:05.424 --> 02:07.759
She's not gonna keep me
away from my reunion.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.994
You know what?
I hope that she comes.

02:09.995 --> 02:12.630
I hope she comes and brings
whatever-his-name-was.

02:12.631 --> 02:16.367
Oh, yeah. The guy that
dumped you for her. Jack.

02:16.368 --> 02:18.970
Jack.

02:18.971 --> 02:24.375
I know his name was jack.
You think I forgot
his name was jack?

02:24.376 --> 02:26.978
Practically ruined
my whole senior year.

02:26.979 --> 02:32.884
Everybody in the school knew
that my best friend was seeing
my boyfriend, except me.

02:32.885 --> 02:36.755
So you want to fly to dc
to be mocked and humiliated?

02:36.756 --> 02:39.157
I could do that
right here.

03:49.728 --> 03:52.496
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:57.436 --> 03:58.703
What you got in this thing?

03:58.704 --> 03:59.838
Clothes.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.772
We're only going to dc
for two days.

04:01.773 --> 04:03.975
And two nights.
That's four outfits.

04:03.976 --> 04:05.776
And they said it might snow.

04:05.777 --> 04:09.013
So what did you do, pack
a snow shovel and a plow?

04:09.014 --> 04:11.749
No. A parka and boots.

04:11.750 --> 04:15.320
I'm not gonna
walk in the slush
in my high heels.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.990
<i>(thud)</i>
what you got in there?

04:18.991 --> 04:20.591
My essentials.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.560
The makeup, the night cream,
the day cream,

04:22.561 --> 04:25.864
The concealer, the cotton balls,
magnifying mirror...

04:25.865 --> 04:28.132
Why don't you just airmail
the whole bathroom...

04:28.133 --> 04:30.501
Oh!
<i>(thud)</i>

04:30.502 --> 04:33.838
I wish I could.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.040
There's a big difference
between men and women.

04:36.041 --> 04:39.244
Look what you're taking -
the godzilla bag.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.279
And I got this.

04:42.982 --> 04:48.686
Between this and what I got on,
I got everything I need,
including...

04:48.687 --> 04:51.455
...A suit.

04:55.827 --> 04:59.998
You have a whole suit
squished into that little pouch?

04:59.999 --> 05:03.768
Yeah, and I got a necktie
in there somehow.

05:03.769 --> 05:06.037
I don't know about this.
It's wrinkle-free.

05:06.038 --> 05:07.906
You hang it up, couple hours -
boom, the wrinkles are gone.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.508
It's made out of
space-age woven polyester.

05:10.509 --> 05:12.510
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

05:16.382 --> 05:18.883
Hi, al.
Hi, jill. I hope
I'm not late.

05:18.884 --> 05:21.219
Hey, tim. How are you?
What's in the bag?

05:21.220 --> 05:24.655
You're only
staying here two days.
And two nights.

05:24.656 --> 05:26.891
I bought cupcakes for dessert,
if that's ok.

05:26.892 --> 05:30.628
Oh, thank you, and thank you
for giving up your weekend
to stay with our kids.

05:30.629 --> 05:32.130
No, no, it's my pleasure.

05:32.131 --> 05:33.664
Where are the plane tickets?

05:33.665 --> 05:35.666
I thought you had 'em.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.702
I hope I didn't jam 'em in that
little wrinkle-free suit bag.

05:38.703 --> 05:41.672
No, up on my dresser.
<i>(groans)</i>

05:41.673 --> 05:44.242
Ok, al, I've got a few
instructions for you here.

05:44.243 --> 05:48.346
Mark has a birthday party to
go to tomorrow at the ice rink.
This is the address.

05:48.347 --> 05:51.316
He's a little bit nervous
'cause he hasn't skated
in about a year.

05:51.317 --> 05:54.385
Brad has a girlfriend, ashley,
coming over to study.

05:54.386 --> 05:57.621
Make sure that he studies
his books and not her.

05:57.622 --> 06:03.261
Now, randy still has
a little bronchitis.
Do not let him go outside.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.628
Make sure he takes
all this medicine.

06:04.629 --> 06:06.364
One teaspoon of cough syrup
twice a day,

06:06.365 --> 06:09.033
One teaspoon of antibiotic
three times a day.

06:09.034 --> 06:10.734
This has to live
in the refrigerator.

06:10.735 --> 06:14.605
Now, if his cough turns into
a wheeze, kind of like
a little whistly sound,

06:14.606 --> 06:20.911
Discontinue the cough syrup
and give him two puffs of
this inhaler four times a day.

06:20.912 --> 06:25.016
Unless it's like a big whistle,
and then you should call
the doctor, and then me.

06:25.017 --> 06:28.919
I gave you all...
The doctor's number,
pharmacy number, hotel number

06:28.920 --> 06:30.588
And our flight numbers
right here.

06:30.589 --> 06:32.457
Tim, do you have any
instructions for al?

06:32.458 --> 06:36.361
Don't let anybody
touch my tools.

06:41.633 --> 06:45.303
So, you'll be with us for...
Two nights?
Yeah, that's right.

06:45.304 --> 06:49.107
I hope while you're in our
nation's capital you'll have
time to do some sightseeing.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.642
<i>(imitating his deep voice)</i>
well, we certainly will
attempt it.

06:53.578 --> 06:57.748
We're gonna try to
make it to the smithsonian.

06:57.749 --> 07:01.185
Ooh, excellent choice.
You know, it's home to old glory

07:01.186 --> 07:04.955
And the desk thomas jefferson
used to draft the declaration
of independence.

07:04.956 --> 07:09.894
That's great. We're hoping to
see don garlits' funny car,
"swamp rat."

07:09.895 --> 07:13.831
I'm afraid your room's
not quite ready.

07:13.832 --> 07:15.866
But if you'd like,
we can hold your bags

07:15.867 --> 07:17.768
And you can check in
with the reunion committee.

07:17.769 --> 07:18.769
Ok.
Good.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.639
I just need your
credit card.
Ok.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.307
Jill?

07:23.308 --> 07:26.544
Jill patterson,
give me an "a,"

07:26.545 --> 07:29.380
Give me a "d,"
give me an "a, m, s."

07:29.381 --> 07:33.484
Adams! Adams!
You're the best!

07:33.485 --> 07:34.652
Yes! Oh...!

07:34.653 --> 07:38.856
It's gonna be
a very long weekend.

07:38.857 --> 07:43.161
It is so good to
see you, jill.
Oh, you too.

07:43.162 --> 07:46.064
I have absolutely no idea
who you are.

07:46.065 --> 07:48.366
Leslie morrison.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.834
We were co-captains of
the cheerleading squad.

07:50.835 --> 07:53.137
You look fabulous!

07:53.138 --> 07:55.606
Not that you didn't look
fabulous before,

07:55.607 --> 07:57.808
But you just look
even more fabulous now.

07:57.809 --> 08:00.945
It's because of my nose.
I got a new one.

08:00.946 --> 08:03.147
Oh, it's a beauty!

08:03.148 --> 08:06.884
Oh, oh. Tim, this is
leslie morrison.
This is my husband tim.

08:06.885 --> 08:09.687
Nose to meet you.
I mean...

08:09.688 --> 08:12.223
Nice honker.

08:12.224 --> 08:14.024
I'll have to catch up
with you later, jill.

08:14.025 --> 08:16.594
Ok. All right. Bye-bye.
Nice to meet you.

08:16.595 --> 08:18.796
We'll see you later.

08:18.797 --> 08:20.431
Oh, no. She's here.
Who?

08:20.432 --> 08:22.766
Joanie graham,
the boyfriend stealer.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.002
What are you doing?
I don't want her
to see me.

08:25.003 --> 08:28.606
Well, honey...
I thought you didn't care.

08:28.607 --> 08:30.975
I didn't think I did, until
I saw her little weasely face.

08:30.976 --> 08:32.842
Now I just want to
get out of here and go home.

08:32.844 --> 08:35.679
All right. I'll call a cab,
get the bags.

08:35.679 --> 08:39.350
Tim! I came all this way
to see my friends.

08:39.351 --> 08:40.951
Are you just gonna
let me leave?

08:40.952 --> 08:42.753
That's what you
just asked me to do.

08:42.754 --> 08:45.356
Well, what I want you
to do is be supportive.

08:45.357 --> 08:47.791
How do you want me
to do that?
Just shut up!

08:50.929 --> 08:53.030
Jill?

08:53.031 --> 08:55.633
Joanie!

08:55.634 --> 09:00.571
I am so happy to see you.
How are you?

09:00.572 --> 09:03.508
I'm fine.
I am really glad you came.

09:03.509 --> 09:07.645
It's just been
such a long time.
Yeah, really a long time.

09:07.646 --> 09:11.081
They just told us that
we have to check in at
the reunion committee.

09:11.082 --> 09:13.951
Maybe we'll see you around
a little bit later.
Ok. Well, I hope so,

09:13.952 --> 09:17.855
'cause I'd really love to
sit and talk with you
about some things.

09:17.856 --> 09:22.226
Oh, hey, hey. Not necessary.
It's water under the bridge.

09:22.227 --> 09:24.795
Who comes to a reunion
to talk about the past?

09:27.332 --> 09:29.333
Well, jill...

09:29.334 --> 09:31.969
I mean, we did go through
a lot together.

09:31.970 --> 09:35.640
Well, yeah, but... That was,
like, 20 years ago, you know?

09:35.641 --> 09:41.011
I mean, I don't even
remember the name of the guy
that came between us.

09:41.012 --> 09:43.047
Jack.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.954
It was jack.

09:57.596 --> 10:00.665
It'll be about
five minutes more.
Ok.

10:00.666 --> 10:04.001
If you're so mad at joanie,
why did you tell her
everything was all right?

10:04.002 --> 10:07.572
I don't want to give her
the satisfaction of knowing
that it still bothers me.

10:07.573 --> 10:11.676
Wait a minute.
Come here, sit down.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.211
You didn't want to come here,
but you came here.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.045
You want me to support you,
you want me to shut up.

10:15.046 --> 10:17.181
You hate her, but you want her
to still think you like her.

10:17.182 --> 10:19.883
Exactly.
<i>(groans)</i>

10:19.884 --> 10:24.922
I'll tell you what.
If this were two guys,
it'd be over 20 years ago.

10:24.923 --> 10:29.993
We'd have rolled up our sleeves,
broke each other's noses,
had a couple of beers.

10:29.994 --> 10:34.265
Tim, the reason I never resolved
things with joanie was because
I was just...

10:34.266 --> 10:37.101
So hurt by
what she did to me.

10:37.102 --> 10:41.205
My family moved around so much.
Joanie was the first girlfriend
I ever had.

10:41.206 --> 10:44.375
And she... Betrayed me.

10:44.376 --> 10:47.411
It took me a long time
to trust anybody after that.
Honey...

10:47.412 --> 10:52.316
Betrayed you?
She didn't even have
the nerve to tell me herself.

10:52.317 --> 10:55.886
I had to hear it from
alice the crossing guard.

10:57.556 --> 11:01.091
Look, it was high school.
It was a long time ago.
People change.

11:01.092 --> 11:03.894
I know.
Believe it or not,
in high school,

11:03.895 --> 11:05.596
I was obnoxious.

11:12.704 --> 11:15.939
So you think that I should
just forgive and forget?
Yes.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.841
Forgive and forget.
It was 20 years ago.

11:17.842 --> 11:20.077
The way I look at it,
joanie did you a big favor.

11:20.078 --> 11:24.114
How's that?
Well, she married jack,
who's probably fat and bald,

11:24.115 --> 11:28.352
And you ended up marrying
the manliest man in michigan.

11:28.353 --> 11:31.054
That's true.
Yeah.

11:31.055 --> 11:33.090
We'll have a good time.

11:33.091 --> 11:34.358
Jack.

11:34.359 --> 11:35.593
Jill!

11:35.594 --> 11:38.663
...Went up the hill.

11:38.664 --> 11:44.802
You look great!
So do you.
Really great.

11:44.803 --> 11:47.171
Oh, jack, this is
my husband, um...

11:47.172 --> 11:49.507
Tim.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.009
Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, jack.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.478
It's great to see you. All
joanie talked about on the plane

11:54.479 --> 11:56.714
Was jill this, jill that.

11:56.715 --> 12:00.751
Boy, that's funny. That's
all jill talked about -
joanie this, joanie that.

12:00.752 --> 12:04.322
We'd love to stay and talk,
but we have to go get our room,
so maybe we'll see you later.

12:04.323 --> 12:07.391
Ok, great.
Nice meeting you.
Good to meet you.

12:07.392 --> 12:11.161
You were attracted to that?

12:11.162 --> 12:14.998
I'm sorry, but you
promised me you were
gonna keep the door open.

12:14.999 --> 12:17.535
The wind blew it shut.
Yeah.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.371
Oh, yeah, right.
All those big gusts coming
in from the bathroom?

12:20.372 --> 12:22.139
I don't think so.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.742
All right, come on.
Ashley, you sit right over here.

12:24.743 --> 12:30.514
Bradley, you sit...
No, randy, no.
No cookies before dinner.

12:30.515 --> 12:34.017
My ankles hurt.
I can't do this.

12:34.018 --> 12:35.853
Are you remembering
to glide?

12:35.854 --> 12:38.656
Al, I'm bored. How about
I just go out for a minute?

12:38.657 --> 12:43.026
No. No, randy.
Remember what your mother said.

12:43.027 --> 12:45.796
I'm not going to
the stupid party.

12:45.797 --> 12:48.432
Look, you're doing great.
Come on. You know?

12:48.433 --> 12:52.002
There's gonna be pizza
there and party favors.

12:52.003 --> 12:58.208
You know, I remember
my first pizza/skating party.

12:58.209 --> 13:02.212
I was 32.
Al! I'm not doing this.

13:02.213 --> 13:04.648
Glide.
<i>(clomping)</i>

13:06.284 --> 13:08.486
All right, come on, you guys,
back to your corners.

13:08.487 --> 13:11.655
You haven't even cracked a book.
What are you reading? Let's go.

13:11.656 --> 13:13.323
<i>(beeping)</i>
aw, gee.

13:13.324 --> 13:17.094
Randy, it's time for
your antibiotics. Randy?

13:17.095 --> 13:19.296
Randy!

13:19.297 --> 13:21.965
Randy, what are you doing?

13:21.966 --> 13:24.769
Al, I've been stuck in
the house for five days.

13:24.770 --> 13:28.372
I know, but your bronchitis is
gonna flare up. Let's go inside.

13:28.373 --> 13:32.610
Come on. Let's go.
Randy!

13:32.611 --> 13:36.547
Al, what happened to you?
You used to be so cool.

13:36.548 --> 13:39.316
Now you're like mom
with a beard.

13:40.919 --> 13:44.187
Well, I'm still cool.

13:47.926 --> 13:50.093
That's not funny.

13:50.094 --> 13:53.196
Randy, you open
this door.
What?

13:53.197 --> 13:56.166
Brad, ashley, would you...?
Open this door!

13:56.167 --> 13:58.669
Open this door
this moment!

14:03.374 --> 14:06.644
All right, ok, so...
Mark! Brad!

14:06.645 --> 14:09.880
Come on, you guys,
it's cold out here.
Come on.

14:09.881 --> 14:12.817
Let's go. Open this door.
I'm not kidding around!

14:16.154 --> 14:19.189
Problems,
temporary taylor dad?

14:19.190 --> 14:21.391
Oh, hi, wilson.
Hi-ho.

14:21.392 --> 14:24.528
Listen, wilson. You wouldn't
happen to have any extra keys,
would you?

14:24.529 --> 14:26.497
Yes, indeedy.
Great.

14:26.498 --> 14:29.099
Matter of fact,
I have a whole taylor packet.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.035
Tim leaves it with me
for all the different
baby-sitters.

14:32.036 --> 14:35.940
Here we go. We got some
band-aids, some gauze,

14:35.941 --> 14:38.642
Handcuff keys...

14:38.643 --> 14:42.312
Here we go. House keys.
Thank you, wilson.

14:42.313 --> 14:45.382
Those boys are...
They're a handful.

14:45.383 --> 14:49.520
They are a puckish
band of rapscallions.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.958
You know, wilson...

14:53.959 --> 14:58.462
I always pictured myself
getting married

14:58.463 --> 15:01.866
And having a bustling
houseful of kids.

15:01.867 --> 15:05.035
Boy, I'm starting
to reconsider.

15:05.036 --> 15:08.472
Well, al, I wouldn't write off
parenthood entirely.

15:08.473 --> 15:12.242
When you start off with a baby,
you're a baby as a parent.

15:12.243 --> 15:15.212
Then as the children grow up,
the parent grows too,

15:15.213 --> 15:19.683
So that hopefully, when
adolescence is reached,
you're both ready for it.

15:19.684 --> 15:23.120
That's a wonderful thought,
wilson.

15:23.121 --> 15:26.056
Well, being a bachelor,
it's easy to come up
with these things.

15:27.392 --> 15:29.760
But I wouldn't
worry about it, al.

15:29.761 --> 15:33.196
I suspect that someday
you'll make an excellent parent.

15:40.872 --> 15:42.773
You really think
I'd make a good parent?

15:42.774 --> 15:45.475
Certainly. I've seen the way
you take care of tim.

15:45.476 --> 15:49.380
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

15:55.186 --> 15:57.220
It doesn't look that bad.

15:57.221 --> 16:02.693
You might as well have
worn your pajamas.

16:02.694 --> 16:05.095
Stop, stop, stop.

16:06.765 --> 16:10.067
You're makin' it worse.

16:10.068 --> 16:13.070
Why...

16:13.071 --> 16:16.506
Why did you wait so long
to take it out of the pouch?

16:17.909 --> 16:20.644
It'll be ok if you just
leave it alone, all right?

16:20.645 --> 16:23.681
Needs air. It just needs
to breathe. It needs to breathe.

16:23.682 --> 16:26.083
It looks like it needs cpr.

16:28.486 --> 16:30.588
Hi, linda.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.056

Oh, chris keller!
<i>¿cómo está usted?</i>

17:20.839 --> 17:22.405
Jill, tim, I hope
you don't mind.

17:22.406 --> 17:26.343
We had 'em make a switch so
we could sit at the same table.

17:26.344 --> 17:29.446
<i>(with false enthusiasm)</i>
the same table.

17:29.447 --> 17:33.517
We were gonna just
take our food to go.

17:33.518 --> 17:36.453
I'm being supportive.
No, it's ok. Let's sit.

17:36.454 --> 17:42.325

17:46.197 --> 17:49.967
Uh, we seem to be experiencing
some technical difficulties.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.569
<i>(feedback)</i>

17:52.570 --> 17:55.673
Jack. You said you
fixed this thing.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.875
I thought I got the kinks
out of that thing.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.943
Um... Don't mind me,
but you probably have

17:59.944 --> 18:02.046
A ground-loop problem
between the amp and mixer.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.881
You know about this stuff?
Yeah, a little bit.

18:03.882 --> 18:05.683
Check it out with me?
I could do that.

18:05.684 --> 18:09.019
Thanks.
Jack needs some help.

18:09.020 --> 18:11.989
It's ok. Go ahead.
Excuse me.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.624
Everyone just have
a good time.

18:14.625 --> 18:19.496
Jack thinks he's so handy,
but basically he screws up
everything he touches.

18:19.497 --> 18:22.365
It must be awful to be married
to a man like that.

18:26.604 --> 18:28.638
So...

18:28.639 --> 18:30.507
So...

18:31.710 --> 18:34.912
You look
really great. Really.

18:34.913 --> 18:38.148
You too. Really great.

18:38.149 --> 18:41.719
So, um... Where are you
living now?
Detroit.

18:41.720 --> 18:47.124
I work for a magazine there.
Great. We're in
san francisco.

18:47.125 --> 18:50.694
Tim seems...
He seems very nice.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.330
Suit in a pouch?

18:53.331 --> 18:55.665
Exactly.

18:58.436 --> 19:00.670
How long have you
been married?

19:00.671 --> 19:02.505
Oh. Um...
Almost 16 years.

19:07.645 --> 19:10.647
And the sparks
are still there.

19:13.651 --> 19:17.154
Do you have any kids?
Yeah, we have three boys.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.957
Three... Oh, my...
Do you have pictures?
I would love to see them.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.558
Ok. Um...

19:21.559 --> 19:24.228
Let's see.
There.

19:26.030 --> 19:32.369
<i>(gasps)</i> oh, they're so cute!
Look at them! They're darling!

19:32.370 --> 19:35.773
Who's the guy behind the fence?
You can't see his face.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.441
Oh, that's wilson.
That's our neighbor.

19:38.442 --> 19:42.612
They're just adorable.
Um, these are mine.

19:42.613 --> 19:45.348
Oh, she is beautiful.
Thank you.

19:45.349 --> 19:50.788
Gosh. They seem so grown-up.

19:50.789 --> 19:57.094
Yeah, uh... Katie is 16
and jack junior... Is 20.

19:59.764 --> 20:01.731
20?

20:01.732 --> 20:05.869
Yeah. Uh...
When we graduated...

20:08.539 --> 20:12.409
What?
I was two months pregnant.

20:15.313 --> 20:21.318
I... I don't know what to say.
I just can't believe that
I never heard about that.

20:21.319 --> 20:23.787
Jill, nobody ever
heard about that.

20:23.788 --> 20:27.457
We never meant for it
to happen that way.

20:27.458 --> 20:31.728
Jack and I fell in love
and I never knew
how to tell you.

20:31.729 --> 20:33.964
Well, yeah.

20:33.965 --> 20:37.835
I mean, I can see how
it would have been hard
to call me and say,

20:37.836 --> 20:42.105
"guess what. I'm in love
with your boyfriend
and I'm having his baby."

20:42.106 --> 20:45.909
I never could find that
appropriate greeting card.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.010
Ouch!

21:00.558 --> 21:03.560
This must have been
just awful for you.

21:03.561 --> 21:06.196
I wish that you
would have told me.

21:06.197 --> 21:08.631
How... You wouldn't even talk...
How could I tell you?

21:08.632 --> 21:10.934
You were
so angry about jack.

21:10.935 --> 21:13.670
You were furious,
remember?
Yes, I was, I was.

21:13.671 --> 21:18.041
I was very angry
about jack.

21:18.042 --> 21:20.911
But I think...

21:20.912 --> 21:24.181
No, I know that I would have
been there for you.

21:24.182 --> 21:27.284
I really loved you.

21:27.285 --> 21:29.853
You were my best friend.

21:29.854 --> 21:34.557
Please. Some best friend.
I took your boyfriend away.

21:34.558 --> 21:36.526
As bad as that felt,

21:36.527 --> 21:40.830
In the long run
it felt worse...
Losing you.

21:40.831 --> 21:46.536
You know, I've wanted to call
you, like, a thousand times.

21:46.537 --> 21:51.674
I wish that you would have.
I really missed you.

21:51.675 --> 21:53.810
I missed you too.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.818
No cause for alarm,

22:01.819 --> 22:05.122
But I think we'll have to exit
the building quasi-quickly.

22:05.123 --> 22:09.259

Go. Back door.

out to be such a great night.

22:22.073 --> 22:25.475
Well, the best part
is that you and joanie
are friends again.

22:25.476 --> 22:30.747
And you know what? When I was at
the fire department with jack,
we got to talking.

22:30.748 --> 22:34.284
He's a terrific guy.
Yeah, I always thought so.

22:34.285 --> 22:36.219
Let me ask you a question.

22:36.220 --> 22:39.856
If joanie hadn't stolen
him out from under you,
would you have married him?

22:39.857 --> 22:42.225
No, I don't think so.

22:42.226 --> 22:45.728
I like being the good-looking
one in the relationship.
