WEBVTT

00:45.120 --> 00:47.320
Looks like a good turnout
for the Darrowby fair.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.760
Oh, it does.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.480
Which is why it's the perfect time
to open the surgery

00:51.480 --> 00:53.480
up to the public.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.000
Show ourselves off at our
professional best.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.200
Yes. So you said.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.520
I'm sure we'll still get to see
some of the fun.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.120
Ah, James, all set?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.480
I think so.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.320
Nice badge.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.240
Now, don't forget,
you're representing the practice.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.440
I won't, Siegfried. I'm honoured.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.640
COW MOOS

01:41.680 --> 01:43.560
Come on, Clive.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.120
Mr Herriot.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.800
Right on time, I'm pleased to see.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.960
Of course, Mr Foyle.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.000
Looking forward to it.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.040
Good. Good.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.200
Well, we've a lot to get through.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.440
"Tempus fergit" as they say.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.600
Two bob says he won't last
past lunchtime.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
Honestly, Tristan.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.920
Remember when Grier did it?
Drunk by midday.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.560
Threatened to punch Foyle in
the mouth.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.960
Two bob. 3:30.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.480
What do you say, Mrs Hall?

02:07.480 --> 02:09.400
Think he'll make it to the
family pets?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.200
I most certainly do.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.840
And I don't approve of gambling.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.040
Two bob. Six o'clock.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.160
Not a minute sooner.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.400
These are for you.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.640
A map of the show.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.840
You'll see that each area
is numbered.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.720
Two for the bull enclosure,
four for the goats and so forth.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.240
The key is at the bottom.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.560
All seems clear enough.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.120
And here's a full timetable
of events.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.880
I've marked up
your particular responsibilities.

02:36.880 --> 02:42.120
The pony measuring will commence
at 1.30 sharp in area ten.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.160
That's the yard at Skeldale House?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.480
It is.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.240
And then at 5pm, you'll be
required to judge the pet show

02:48.240 --> 02:49.440
in area nine.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.800
Also Skeldale House?

02:52.800 --> 02:53.960
Yes.

02:53.960 --> 02:57.440
At all other times, as attending
vet, you must remain here,

02:57.440 --> 02:59.160
in area one.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.320
So you can be located immediately.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.440
Now, my watch is synchronised with
the village clock.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.320
I would suggest that you do
the same.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.360
Right.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.080
BELL RINGS

03:14.200 --> 03:16.920
Skeldale House is now open!

03:16.920 --> 03:20.040
That's Skeldale House is now open
to the public!

03:26.320 --> 03:28.600
Right, time for our first tour,
I think, Mrs Hall.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.920
How many are we?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.320
Three.

03:31.320 --> 03:35.040
Well, I'm sure things will pick up
as the day goes on.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.400
Lady and gentlemen, welcome.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.320
Today, we shall be lifting the
curtain on the fascinating world

03:48.320 --> 03:50.760
of veterinary science.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.920
If I could ask you to step this way,

03:52.920 --> 03:54.200
that's it.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.840
And please, do refrain from touching
the equipment.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.000
Now this is...

03:59.000 --> 04:00.480
You don't mind if I pop out, do you?

04:00.480 --> 04:02.080
Might see how old James
is getting on.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.640
Don't think I don't know what you're
up to.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.120
You leave him be.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.800
Mrs Hall, I'm offended.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.120
A gentleman never interferes
in a wager.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.720
He's in fine form, Mrs Burton.

04:17.960 --> 04:21.320
I'd be surprised if you don't take
home a ribbon this year.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.800
Watch what you're doing, will you?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.160
I'm so sorry, Mr Dinsdale.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.280
Bloody menace.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.600
James.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.960
Sorry. Mind yourself, lad.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.520
There you are. Thank, God.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.120
Will you have a look at
Jenny's ferret?

04:32.120 --> 04:34.480
I was trying to trim his nails,
but he wouldn't stay still.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.360
OK. And now he's bleeding.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.640
Let's take a look, shall we?
Does he bite?

04:38.640 --> 04:39.680
Not much.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.640
Ow!

04:43.640 --> 04:44.800
Oh, God.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.280
No, Leopold. Let go!

04:46.280 --> 04:47.720
Stop pulling your hand.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.720
If you jump around, he'll just
bite harder.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.680
And I thought vets were supposed
to have a way with animals.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.080
And now you're bleeding and all.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.120
Sorry.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.680
The next tour will be
starting shortly.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.320
Please do help yourself to tea.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.720
Thank you.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.880
Thanks very much.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.640
Any chance of anything stronger?

05:17.640 --> 05:21.360
Dorothy, what are you doing here?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.720
I was hoping to whisk you off
for a spot of lunch,

05:23.720 --> 05:27.040
but I seem to have walked in
on some kind of extravaganza.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.480
It's the Darrowby Show.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.920
You stuck in here all day?

05:29.920 --> 05:31.720
Afraid so.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.280
Well, that's no fun.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.960
Perhaps I can lend a hand?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.120
You'd be bored rigid.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.720
Nonsense, it'll be just like
the old days.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.560
The two of us running the show.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.000
But without the zeppelins

05:43.000 --> 05:44.320
or the rationing.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.680
Ferret emergency.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.520
Great.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.160
The powder will stop Leopold's paw
bleeding in no time.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.920
He won't even need a bandage.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.480
Shame we can't say the same for you.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.680
Oh, you know James.

06:01.680 --> 06:05.520
Happy to risk life and limb for a
damsel in distress.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.200
It's looking better already.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.360
We'll make a vet of you yet.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.280
There you are, good as new.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.840
There we are.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.960
Are you showing Clive today?

06:20.960 --> 06:23.160
We are. Dad's desperate to sell him.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.480
Really?

06:24.480 --> 06:25.760
I thought he was a good earner?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.360
Oh, he is, but he won't be forever.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.280
There's a top breeder coming today,
woman called Southwick,

06:31.280 --> 06:33.640
says she might be interested.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.120
If Clive takes first prize, we could
get a really good price.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.360
Good luck.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.680
In fact, I was hoping I could ask
you to vouch for him,

06:39.680 --> 06:42.280
you know, give him a clean bill
of health, if the deal goes ahead.

06:42.280 --> 06:45.680
Of course, I'd be happy to.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.920
Wonderful.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.400
I'd best go and find my dad.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.520
Wasn't old Clive a little bit slow
off the mark with Dobson's cows?

06:54.520 --> 06:56.720
Nothing a shot of testosterone
didn't sort out.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.280
If that bull wins first prize,
could go for a fortune.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.160
God knows they need it.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.320
So long as you're confident
there's no problem.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.080
After the testosterone
was administered

07:06.080 --> 07:07.880
Clive did start doing his business.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.120
No, I know, I know.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.080
Just the moment there's even the
slightest hint that Clive's no good

07:13.080 --> 07:15.920
for breeding, he'd be
practically worthless,

07:15.920 --> 07:17.560
off to the knacker's yard
for pennies.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.280
Maybe I should give him another
once over?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.520
Well, you've already told Helen
you'll vouch for him.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.080
Now, come on, enough of this,

07:23.080 --> 07:26.400
you've been neglecting your real
duties for far too long already.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.680
That's more like it.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.360
You're starting early.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.160
My good friend here needs
fortification for the day ahead.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.880
So, we'll be wanting two more
when you're ready.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.440
Steady on.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.800
You know I'm on duty.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.600
That's why you need to get them in
while you have the chance.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.480
So, have you had your
invitation yet?

07:49.480 --> 07:51.360
Ah? What invitation?

07:51.360 --> 07:53.000
Tea with the parents.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.200
Now you're sticking around,

07:54.200 --> 07:56.520
she'll be expecting things to get
a little more serious.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.000
What? Maggie?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.240
I don't think so.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.640
Mr Herriot, could you spare
a minute?

08:02.640 --> 08:06.240
It's a veterinary matter, I'd value
your opinion.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.400
Can't it wait?

08:07.400 --> 08:09.160
Sorry, Tris, vet business.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.280
My, she's a little beauty,
isn't she?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.680
A dark roan shorthorn.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.160
Nice wide pelvis.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.000
Level udder.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.280
She's a lovely pedigree specimen.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.520
You know, a cow like this doesn't
come cheap, Mr Rudd.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.880
That she doesn't.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.000
But with your say so and
recommendation...

08:49.000 --> 08:50.520
We've been putting some by.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.080
And I would like to make
the investment in a good breeder.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.920
You know, five year from now,
we could have a pedigree herd.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.040
So, would you buy her?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.080
I would.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.400
Was that Dick Rudd I saw you
talking to out there?

09:06.400 --> 09:09.000
He asked me to look over a pedigree
cow he was thinking of buying.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.160
A testament to his high regard for
your professional opinion.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.000
Can I ask you something?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.040
Mm-hm.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.440
Just because you have to administer
testosterone to a bull

09:18.440 --> 09:19.560
to get it serving the cows,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.280
doesn't necessarily mean there's got
to be an underlying problem?

09:22.280 --> 09:23.680
Oh, no, not necessarily.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.520
He might just need a bit of a lift,

09:25.520 --> 09:28.360
must be exhausting moving from herd
to herd like they do.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.400
Of course, it could also
be lameness.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.760
The only thing that really
matters is

09:35.760 --> 09:37.520
whether the cows are in calf or not.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.760
Right.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.200
Mr Dobson.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.880
Hello, there.

09:51.880 --> 09:52.920
Ah, Mr Herriot.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.320
I've been meaning to ask,

09:56.320 --> 09:59.920
how did your herd get on with the
Alderson's bull in the end?

09:59.920 --> 10:01.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, grand.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.880
Mr Herriot.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.920
So, no problems after I left?

10:06.920 --> 10:08.480
No, no, no. No problems.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.680
Mr Herriot, if you please...

10:09.680 --> 10:11.080
Yes, Mr Foyle. Just one moment.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.720
So, your cows are in calf then?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.480
You're needed at the dog show.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.400
I'll let you get on.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.440
Mr Herriot? Dog show.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.840
Now, if you please.

10:29.442 --> 10:33.082
Now, can anyone tell me
what this is?

10:33.082 --> 10:34.842
No?

10:34.842 --> 10:39.082
Well, we use this to administer
anaesthetic during surgery,

10:39.082 --> 10:40.682
you slip it over the head...

10:41.842 --> 10:47.482
Tighten the strap and slip in
the chloroform.

10:47.482 --> 10:51.122
It's very effective,
and entirely painless.

10:51.122 --> 10:53.042
HE GROANS

10:53.042 --> 10:57.722
So then, once little Tiddles or
Fido is happily asleep...

10:57.722 --> 10:58.802
TRISTAN SNORES

10:58.802 --> 11:00.202
Yes, thank you.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.802
..we move onto our top of the range
surgical equipment.

11:04.802 --> 11:08.442
We have scalpels for making the
initial incision.

11:08.442 --> 11:09.482
Thank you.

11:11.122 --> 11:13.762
We have saws for cutting through
the bone...

11:13.762 --> 11:15.442
HE MIMICS SQUEAKY SAWING

11:15.442 --> 11:18.362
..various sizes for
various thicknesses.

11:18.362 --> 11:21.802
LOUDER SAWING

11:21.802 --> 11:24.162
And of course a whole variety
of forceps

11:24.162 --> 11:27.402
and curettes for really
digging around.

11:31.122 --> 11:32.282
Yes, well.

11:32.282 --> 11:33.922
Moving on.

11:38.682 --> 11:41.442
Right, a quick hiatus, I think,
Mrs Hall.

11:42.842 --> 11:45.042
I might see what refreshments
are on offer.

11:46.282 --> 11:48.442
Oh, hello there.

11:48.442 --> 11:49.442
Mr Farnon.

11:51.322 --> 11:52.882
You remember Dorothy.

11:52.882 --> 11:55.082
Yes, yes, of course. How nice to see
you again.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.802
I hear you're quite the tour guide.

11:56.802 --> 11:58.322
Oh, well, doing our best.

11:58.322 --> 12:01.482
"Very informative" and "not boring
at all" apparently.

12:01.482 --> 12:03.642
Oh, well, high praise indeed.

12:07.402 --> 12:09.202
Anyway, shan't be long.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.162
Oh, Tris, are you coming?

12:17.962 --> 12:19.362
Couldn't you go too, Aud?

12:19.362 --> 12:21.082
I can't leave the
surgery unattended,

12:21.082 --> 12:23.122
as they both well know.

12:23.122 --> 12:24.802
Well, I'm here.

12:24.802 --> 12:26.402
And I'm reasonably trustworthy.

12:26.402 --> 12:28.402
Go on, you're dying to have
a look round.

12:28.402 --> 12:30.842
You can repay me later in gin.

12:30.842 --> 12:33.482
Well, maybe just for a minute.

12:36.842 --> 12:39.042
They won't let us in the show.

12:39.042 --> 12:40.882
I know you need to be careful,
veterinary,

12:40.882 --> 12:42.682
but there's nowt wrong with t'dog.

12:42.682 --> 12:44.882
He has some matter in the corner of
his eye.

12:44.882 --> 12:48.882
Oh, that's just a bit of powder
I was using on him, that's all.

12:48.882 --> 12:50.362
I told that to him.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.362
I don't know why he's being
so fussy.

12:56.962 --> 12:59.682
His temperature's 104.

12:59.682 --> 13:01.882
I'm sorry, I can't allow him into
the show.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.722
But we've shown this dog every year.

13:03.722 --> 13:06.122
Well, you can't show him with
a temperature like that.

13:06.122 --> 13:07.362
But, wait a minute!

13:09.402 --> 13:10.882
He's had a long car journey.

13:10.882 --> 13:12.882
That could put up his temperature,
couldn't it?

13:12.882 --> 13:14.282
Not by that much, it couldn't.

13:14.282 --> 13:16.802
You need to take him home
and see your regular vet.

13:18.082 --> 13:19.842
So, you won't let me
take him inside?

13:19.842 --> 13:21.882
I'm afraid it's out of the question.

13:21.882 --> 13:23.682
I'm sorry.

13:23.682 --> 13:25.722
There you are, come on,
don't dilly dally.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.362
Sorry? Luncheon is served, old boy.

13:27.362 --> 13:30.122
And there's a pint or three with
your name on it.

13:33.482 --> 13:35.282
Now, then, Mr Herriot.

13:37.522 --> 13:39.522
Helen says you'll vouch for
our bull.

13:39.522 --> 13:42.402
Yes, of course.

13:42.402 --> 13:43.762
Much appreciated.

13:43.762 --> 13:45.602
You're welcome, Mr Alderson.

13:45.602 --> 13:46.642
Aye.

13:50.442 --> 13:52.642
Ah, Herriot, just the man.

13:52.642 --> 13:55.162
May I introduce my
god-daughter, Penelope?

13:55.162 --> 13:56.282
Hello, there.

13:56.282 --> 13:57.802
And this here is Binkie.

13:59.202 --> 14:01.682
She's feeling a little nervous about
the pet contest.

14:01.682 --> 14:03.002
Ah, there's no need.

14:03.002 --> 14:05.042
I'm sure Binkie here will
do marvellously.

14:05.042 --> 14:06.402
There you are, Penn.

14:06.402 --> 14:08.602
I told you there was nothing to
worry about.

14:11.522 --> 14:13.042
All right, well...

14:14.522 --> 14:17.722
Helen said that she told you about
their possible buyer.

14:17.722 --> 14:19.722
Yes, she did.

14:19.722 --> 14:22.002
A lot riding on the sale of that
bull for the Aldersons.

14:22.002 --> 14:24.882
Well, yes, I would imagine so.

14:24.882 --> 14:29.482
Wouldn't want anything to scupper
their chances.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.762
No need to go looking for problems,

14:31.762 --> 14:33.562
if you take my meaning?

14:36.042 --> 14:39.282
Right. Well, come on, Pen, let's go
find your mother, shall we?

14:42.802 --> 14:45.722
Here you go, and there's plenty more
where that came from.

14:47.682 --> 14:49.682
You do know you're wasting
your time.

14:49.682 --> 14:50.722
What do you mean?

14:50.722 --> 14:52.162
You can't compete, old chap.

14:52.162 --> 14:55.322
He's got the land, the house,
the pots of cash.

14:55.322 --> 14:57.642
Helen's no gold-digger, but a girl
has to be practical.

14:57.642 --> 14:59.562
He was talking about
Alderson's bull.

14:59.562 --> 15:00.802
Oh, yes?

15:00.802 --> 15:03.482
I got the distinct impression
he was...

15:03.482 --> 15:05.322
..warning me off.

15:05.322 --> 15:08.362
Oh, so you think
he's feeling threatened?

15:08.362 --> 15:10.522
That is not... No.

15:10.522 --> 15:11.922
This is not about Helen.

15:14.882 --> 15:17.362
Come on, drink up and we'll go to
the Drovers.

15:17.362 --> 15:18.762
I can't leave the show.

15:18.762 --> 15:20.002
Course you can.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.522
You've done your bit.
Foyle can measure a few ponies.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.762
Mr Herriot!

15:23.762 --> 15:24.962
Area ten!

15:24.962 --> 15:28.682
Please report to area ten for the
pony measuring!

15:28.682 --> 15:30.082
Ignore him. Stay and have a drink.

15:30.082 --> 15:31.162
Mr Herriot! Area ten!

15:31.162 --> 15:32.762
No, I can't. Sorry.

15:32.762 --> 15:33.842
Jim.

15:35.682 --> 15:38.122
I see James is still going strong.

15:38.122 --> 15:40.602
Lunchtime you said, wasn't it?

15:40.602 --> 15:43.162
Afraid you're out of the running,
little brother.

15:54.762 --> 15:57.682
That's it, names and addresses
in the book

15:57.682 --> 15:59.882
and the next tour will be
starting shortly.

15:59.882 --> 16:01.682
Is everything all right?
Where's Mrs Hall?

16:01.682 --> 16:03.842
She's gone to get some lunch.

16:03.842 --> 16:06.762
Don't worry, I've been keeping
a close eye.

16:06.762 --> 16:10.402
No-one's made off with
the silverware.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.802
So, how was your trip?

16:13.802 --> 16:15.362
Malta, wasn't it?

16:15.362 --> 16:16.802
It was glorious.

16:16.802 --> 16:22.202
Blazing hot with nothing to do but
sun and swim.

16:22.202 --> 16:25.082
Darrowby must seem rather dull
in comparison.

16:25.082 --> 16:28.242
Not at all, I'm really rather
enjoying myself.

16:30.762 --> 16:35.602
Well, I should go and get my coat
and then we should crack on.

16:35.602 --> 16:37.402
Your audience awaits.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.242
Mr Herriot!

16:52.242 --> 16:54.402
Did you not hear me?

16:54.402 --> 16:56.362
You are needed for the ponies.

16:56.362 --> 16:59.282
Yes, yes, I know.

16:59.282 --> 17:01.242
There's just a bull
I need to look at.

17:01.242 --> 17:02.762
Is the animal injured?

17:02.762 --> 17:05.522
Does it require urgent
medical attention?

17:05.522 --> 17:06.602
It does not.

17:06.602 --> 17:08.642
Then I'm afraid it will have
to wait.

17:18.722 --> 17:19.962
13 two.

17:24.362 --> 17:26.882
I'm sorry. He's too big for
that class.

17:26.882 --> 17:29.322
Well, have you allowed for
his shoes?

17:29.322 --> 17:33.162
I have, but as you can see
he's well over 13 two.

17:33.162 --> 17:35.122
He's actually over 14 hands.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.322
He passed the vet at Hickly
without any trouble.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.482
I can't help that.

17:38.482 --> 17:40.922
If you want to compete, he'll need
to be in the higher class.

17:40.922 --> 17:41.962
Next, please.

17:45.002 --> 17:47.682
You really do need to keep them
moving, Mr Herriot.

17:47.682 --> 17:49.882
Tempus fergit, you know.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.362
There was another chap was convinced
his dog was psychic

17:55.362 --> 17:59.202
because it always barked just before
the doorbell rang.

17:59.202 --> 18:00.522
Never occurred to him that

18:00.522 --> 18:02.882
the animal just had better hearing
than he did.

18:09.402 --> 18:11.602
Well, it's true what they say.

18:11.602 --> 18:14.562
You really do see all human life
in a place like this.

18:14.562 --> 18:16.042
Well, I suppose we do.

18:17.642 --> 18:20.762
I think you're a very fortunate man,
Mr Farnon.

18:20.762 --> 18:24.242
You've built a life doing what you
love most.

18:24.242 --> 18:25.722
Not many people manage that.

18:29.562 --> 18:30.642
And, have you?

18:35.202 --> 18:36.322
On the whole.

18:38.122 --> 18:40.402
I've had my share of...

18:40.402 --> 18:41.922
..disappointments.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.282
And loss.

18:47.002 --> 18:50.002
Things don't always work out the way
we expect.

18:50.002 --> 18:51.042
Very true.

18:52.682 --> 18:56.362
But moving forward in hope,
that's the key, isn't it?

18:58.482 --> 19:00.202
There's so much in life to savour.

19:07.482 --> 19:10.162
Audrey, there you are.

19:10.162 --> 19:11.522
You've been missing all the fun.

19:11.522 --> 19:12.642
Oh, yes?

19:12.642 --> 19:15.042
But you two ladies should be out
enjoying the show.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.202
Tristan and I can manage here.

19:17.202 --> 19:18.642
Of course.

19:18.642 --> 19:19.802
What do you say, Aud?

19:19.802 --> 19:20.922
You did promise me a gin.

19:20.922 --> 19:22.162
If you're quite sure?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.202
Absolutely.

19:24.282 --> 19:26.882
Well, it's been a pleasure working
with you, Mr Farnon.

19:26.882 --> 19:28.042
And with you.

19:42.122 --> 19:46.362
Maggie seems thoroughly and
surprisingly enamoured of you.

19:47.802 --> 19:48.922
Does she?

19:48.922 --> 19:49.962
Mm.

19:51.282 --> 19:52.762
Oh, God.

19:52.762 --> 19:55.282
Do I detect that the thrill of the
chase is less exciting than

19:55.282 --> 19:56.842
the actual catch?

19:56.842 --> 19:59.802
Maggie's wonderful, really,

19:59.802 --> 20:01.682
I'm just not sure about
meeting parents.

20:01.682 --> 20:03.162
Because that's what happens next.

20:03.162 --> 20:06.122
I mean, do you think I'm anywhere
near ready to meet parents?

20:08.482 --> 20:09.962
Dorothy left her hat.

20:11.762 --> 20:14.322
I won't have a man under my roof
mess a girl around.

20:15.722 --> 20:18.842
You're better than that, Tristan.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.162
Yes, Mrs H.

20:25.562 --> 20:27.922
Right, I've still an hour or two
to win this bet.

20:27.922 --> 20:31.362
I'm off to the pony measuring, see
if I can't tip James over the edge.

20:39.762 --> 20:41.002
Everything all right?

20:43.282 --> 20:44.642
I've barely had a single animal

20:44.642 --> 20:47.202
that's the right height for the
class they've been entered in.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.242
Ah.

20:48.242 --> 20:51.002
And I had one that stooped down at
the knees every time I came near it.

20:51.002 --> 20:52.242
Pin pricks.

20:52.242 --> 20:53.282
I'm sorry?

20:53.282 --> 20:55.202
They prick them between the
shoulder blades,

20:55.202 --> 20:57.042
so they drop down if you try
and measure them.

20:57.042 --> 20:58.402
What? It's appalling, I know.

20:58.402 --> 21:00.602
You see, this is what
you're up against.

21:07.922 --> 21:09.682
Here.

21:09.682 --> 21:11.442
Get a drink.

21:11.442 --> 21:13.162
And the winner for the best in
show sheep

21:13.162 --> 21:16.442
goes to Mrs Ackroyd for her
Swaledale, Nellie.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.082
Excuse me. Do you know where the
vet is?

21:18.082 --> 21:20.242
I'm sorry, I don't.

21:20.242 --> 21:22.442
Do you know where the vet is?
No, no, sorry, I don't.

21:26.122 --> 21:29.322
Siegfried can certainly be
very entertaining.

21:30.362 --> 21:31.682
He has his moments.

21:32.962 --> 21:35.562
You said he was a widower?

21:35.562 --> 21:37.802
He lost his wife four years ago.

21:39.362 --> 21:41.602
I would have thought it was
more recent.

21:41.602 --> 21:42.882
Oh, yes?

21:45.762 --> 21:50.002
Am I to take it you've designs on
our Mr Farnon?

21:50.002 --> 21:52.882
Oh, don't think so.

21:52.882 --> 21:55.082
Reckon I'd scare the poor chap
to death.

21:57.402 --> 22:00.922
Besides, he strikes me as a man who
still thinks of himself as married.

22:04.802 --> 22:08.082
Well, you can't always change how
you feel.

22:10.802 --> 22:14.362
Leaving that brute was the best
and bravest thing you ever did.

22:14.362 --> 22:15.762
Yes.

22:15.762 --> 22:17.762
Well...

22:17.762 --> 22:20.362
..now, I promised Mr Enderby
I'd look in on the produce hall,

22:20.362 --> 22:23.722
he's very keen to show me
his shallots.

22:23.722 --> 22:25.482
Then I shall love you and leave you.

22:27.122 --> 22:28.282
I'll see you soon, Aud.

22:35.642 --> 22:39.322
I'm sorry. I've measured him
three times, he's still over.

22:39.322 --> 22:40.482
What about the shoes?

22:40.482 --> 22:42.002
You have to deduct for shoes.

22:42.002 --> 22:43.402
I know, but even so.

22:47.682 --> 22:49.562
He doesn't have shoes!

22:49.562 --> 22:50.602
Ha!

22:58.442 --> 22:59.602
What's this?

22:59.602 --> 23:00.922
Certificate.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.082
Where's the pony?

23:02.082 --> 23:03.322
Here we go.

23:03.322 --> 23:06.122
You don't need to see him
if I've got a certificate.

23:06.122 --> 23:08.842
The vet's written how tall he
is there.

23:08.842 --> 23:09.922
I'll need to measure him.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.082
Certificate or not.

23:11.082 --> 23:12.642
Well, that's not what my dad says.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.602
Well, I'm afraid your dad's wrong.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.922
We'll see about that.

23:19.842 --> 23:21.082
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

23:21.082 --> 23:22.242
They'll try anything.

23:22.242 --> 23:23.802
If I were you, I'd tell them to
go hang.

23:23.802 --> 23:26.482
Are you sure you don't want to go
and watch the jumping, Siegfried?

23:26.482 --> 23:28.402
No, no. Happy to lend my support.

23:28.402 --> 23:30.962
And the winner for the largest
marrow are the Clough brothers.

23:30.962 --> 23:32.482
Very well done.

23:32.482 --> 23:34.882
Congratulations.

23:34.882 --> 23:35.922
Marvellous effort.

23:35.922 --> 23:37.762
Well done.

23:41.322 --> 23:43.522
That's not right.
These guns ain't right.

23:43.522 --> 23:44.442
Can't you read?

23:44.442 --> 23:45.642
I am a good shot, I am.

23:45.642 --> 23:47.922
No refunds means no refunds.

23:47.922 --> 23:50.122
Not my fault if you can't
shoot straight.

23:50.122 --> 23:53.202
You want to find yourself a lad
with half a brain.

23:55.402 --> 23:56.802
Steady, steady.

23:58.522 --> 24:01.162
DOG WHIMPERS

24:01.162 --> 24:02.442
You've got to accept it.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.002
You don't need any measurements
if you've got a certificate.

24:05.002 --> 24:06.842
Every animal goes under the stick.

24:06.842 --> 24:09.282
And it's not as though your pony
was slightly over the mark.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.882
He's miles over.

24:10.882 --> 24:13.642
Well, let me tell you, he was passed
through that vet at...

24:13.642 --> 24:15.002
Hickly! I know.

24:15.002 --> 24:17.282
And I don't care, he's not going
through here.

24:17.282 --> 24:18.802
Well, really?

24:18.802 --> 24:20.682
You know, we were passed at
Hickly too.

24:20.682 --> 24:22.882
Could you take my dog's
temperature again?

24:22.882 --> 24:24.362
He looks so much better.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.002
Won't you just try him
one more time?

24:26.002 --> 24:27.642
No, I bloody won't.

24:27.642 --> 24:29.442
Just take your damn dog home.

24:30.562 --> 24:32.922
You know, James, if you wanted to
pack it in...

24:32.922 --> 24:33.962
What?

24:33.962 --> 24:36.322
You don't have to put up with this,
this is an outrage.

24:36.322 --> 24:39.922
Mr Farnon, I need you.

24:39.922 --> 24:42.362
Hey, what are you doing with my dog?

24:58.562 --> 24:59.722
What's happened?

24:59.722 --> 25:01.282
Poor thing was hit by a pumpkin.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.362
Pumpkin?

25:02.362 --> 25:04.722
He was tied up safe as houses.
I'd only left him for a minute.

25:04.722 --> 25:06.762
Sometimes a minute is all it takes.

25:06.762 --> 25:08.122
I'll need you to assist me.

25:08.122 --> 25:10.322
If it hadn't been for that other
vet, messing me about.

25:10.322 --> 25:11.762
You'll have to wait there, Mr..?

25:11.762 --> 25:12.922
Happy.

25:12.922 --> 25:14.122
Really?

25:14.122 --> 25:15.162
Yes.

25:15.162 --> 25:16.322
Excuse me.

25:18.082 --> 25:19.122
Right. OK.

25:20.242 --> 25:21.282
There we go.

25:24.922 --> 25:27.282
I'll need chloroform,
sterile dressings

25:27.282 --> 25:28.682
and a fresh set of instruments.

25:28.682 --> 25:31.002
This will provide an excellent
teaching opportunity.

25:31.002 --> 25:32.242
Right.

25:32.242 --> 25:34.882
Well, go on, then.
What are you waiting for?

25:40.682 --> 25:41.882
Oi!

25:41.882 --> 25:43.282
Leave that alone.

25:46.682 --> 25:49.482
Ah. Mr Herriot, finished with
the ponies, are you?

25:49.482 --> 25:50.522
Well and truly.

25:50.522 --> 25:52.122
Good. Good. Hey, hey, hey now,

25:52.122 --> 25:54.442
you've only 25 minutes
till the pet contest.

25:54.442 --> 25:56.082
Don't go wandering off.

25:56.082 --> 26:00.122
Mr Foyle, there is something I have
to do, all right?

26:00.122 --> 26:03.202
But I promise you, I will not be
late for the pet contest.

26:03.202 --> 26:04.442
You'd better not be.

26:04.442 --> 26:06.282
Or there'll be
serious repercussions.

26:06.282 --> 26:07.322
No.

26:10.242 --> 26:12.922
I thought they weren't judging the
bulls till 5:30?

26:12.922 --> 26:14.282
No.

26:14.282 --> 26:17.762
They announce the winners at 5:30.

26:17.762 --> 26:20.962
The judging takes place throughout
the afternoon,

26:20.962 --> 26:23.402
and then the judges retire
to deliberate.

26:24.522 --> 26:27.882
You'd know this if you'd consulted
your timetable.

26:30.962 --> 26:32.802
Mr Dobson!

26:32.802 --> 26:34.362
Mr Dobson.

26:34.362 --> 26:37.162
I need to talk to you.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.322
Good boy. That's it.

26:39.322 --> 26:41.042
Right. Probe and forceps.

26:43.322 --> 26:44.802
There's no point giving them to me.

26:44.802 --> 26:46.642
This one's on you.

26:46.642 --> 26:47.922
It's a compound fracture,

26:47.922 --> 26:50.282
so first you need to check for
bone fragments.

26:54.002 --> 26:55.042
Right.

27:09.482 --> 27:11.002
I can't see any fragments.

27:11.002 --> 27:12.162
Are you certain?

27:12.162 --> 27:13.202
I think so.

27:13.202 --> 27:15.242
I don't need you to think,
I need you to know.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.482
I'm certain, the bone's snapped
clean in two.

27:17.482 --> 27:20.962
Excellent, then if you debride
the wound and sluice it out

27:20.962 --> 27:24.082
with plenty of saline, we can set
the bone and stitch him up.

27:24.082 --> 27:25.362
Now, when you say we...

27:25.362 --> 27:28.842
Come on, we don't want to be here
all day.

27:28.842 --> 27:32.002
Mr Dobson, I am just asking
if you noticed any problems

27:32.002 --> 27:33.522
when the bull was in with your herd.

27:33.522 --> 27:35.722
And I told you, everything
were fine.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.522
So you're certain your cows are in
calf, you've actually examined them?

27:38.522 --> 27:42.882
Would Mr Herriot please report to
area nine?

27:42.882 --> 27:46.002
The family pet contest is about
to commence.

27:46.002 --> 27:47.522
Looks like you're needed.

27:47.522 --> 27:48.642
Damn.

27:50.802 --> 27:52.122
Very nice.

27:52.122 --> 27:53.682
Very nice indeed.

27:53.682 --> 27:55.882
Think I might be getting the hang
of this.

28:02.122 --> 28:04.162
You seemed to be having fun today.

28:04.162 --> 28:06.522
Yes, the tours went rather well,
I thought.

28:06.522 --> 28:08.522
I was thinking more of the
fair Dorothy.

28:08.522 --> 28:09.562
Dorothy?

28:09.562 --> 28:11.762
The pair of you were getting on like
a house on fire.

28:11.762 --> 28:13.722
Oh, I don't know about that.

28:13.722 --> 28:15.162
She's a nice enough woman.

28:15.162 --> 28:17.722
Oh, come on, big brother. I saw
the way you were looking at her.

28:17.722 --> 28:20.282
For God's sake, Tristan, must you be
so tediously adolescent?

28:20.282 --> 28:21.402
Well, what's the problem?

28:21.402 --> 28:24.082
She's a woman, you're a man. There's
clearly an attraction there.

28:24.082 --> 28:25.682
You should've asked her out
to dinner.

28:25.682 --> 28:28.602
Don't be obtuse. You know perfectly
well taking a woman to dinner raises

28:28.602 --> 28:29.642
certain expectations.

28:29.642 --> 28:30.882
Would that be such a bad thing?

28:30.882 --> 28:33.082
I'm not discussing this.
Because you know I'm right.

28:33.082 --> 28:35.362
No, because I'm not taking
romantic advice from someone

28:35.362 --> 28:37.402
who's spent the entire day
hiding from a barmaid.

28:37.402 --> 28:40.122
Says the man who runs a mile if a
woman shows the slightest interest.

28:40.122 --> 28:41.162
What utter rot!

28:41.162 --> 28:42.322
I'm right and you know it!

28:42.322 --> 28:45.602
It's like you've given up on having
any life at all.

28:45.602 --> 28:47.962
Oh, well done, lad.

28:47.962 --> 28:49.682
Not long to go now.

28:52.642 --> 28:54.402
You are ten minutes late!

28:54.402 --> 28:56.562
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

28:56.562 --> 28:58.322
Could I just have a word with
Ms Alderson?

28:58.322 --> 29:00.202
No! It'll have to wait.

29:00.202 --> 29:03.402
I'm not saying you need to get
married, just have some blasted fun!

29:03.402 --> 29:05.282
If you had a bit less blasted fun,

29:05.282 --> 29:07.482
you might actually
achieve something!

29:07.482 --> 29:09.202
Now, give me the damn forceps!

29:11.082 --> 29:12.122
Mr Farnon.

29:14.402 --> 29:15.562
What?

29:15.562 --> 29:17.562
There are children on the premises.

29:17.562 --> 29:18.842
Your point being?

29:18.842 --> 29:21.042
I'll thank you to modify
your language.

29:21.042 --> 29:23.602
And I'll thank you to mind your own
bloody business.

29:25.802 --> 29:26.882
In there.

29:26.882 --> 29:27.922
Now.

29:47.962 --> 29:50.522
Well, what a wonderful...

29:50.522 --> 29:53.002
PARROT: Hello, pretty boy!

29:53.002 --> 29:54.802
..and varied turnout.

29:59.042 --> 30:03.322
Well, given the...
given the range of animals,

30:03.322 --> 30:05.122
I'm going to ask the owners to
show me

30:05.122 --> 30:07.482
just how much they know their pets.

30:07.482 --> 30:10.042
Just a couple of questions about
their habits and upkeep.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.322
How does that sound?

30:11.322 --> 30:12.922
Shut your face!

30:14.482 --> 30:16.362
Right then, let's begin.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.322
I miss her too, you know.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.082
What?

30:24.082 --> 30:25.122
Evelyn was...

30:26.442 --> 30:28.202
..she was the absolute best.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.282
No two ways about it.

30:29.282 --> 30:30.322
But, well...

30:32.482 --> 30:34.082
..she isn't here any more,
Siegfried.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.122
If you're going to continue stating
the obvious,

30:36.122 --> 30:37.362
you might as well leave.

30:37.362 --> 30:41.442
I'm just saying, she'd at least want
you to try and be happy.

30:41.442 --> 30:43.162
I mean, you're not entirely
past it.

30:43.162 --> 30:44.562
Good to know.

30:44.562 --> 30:45.682
Bandage.

30:47.642 --> 30:49.482
I'm only thinking of you,
big brother.

30:49.482 --> 30:51.082
Fine, right, point taken.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.242
I should move on and seize the day

30:54.242 --> 30:56.922
and learn to love again.

30:56.922 --> 30:59.282
Now, for God's sake,
will you please shut up?!

30:59.282 --> 31:01.002
Hello, there.

31:01.002 --> 31:02.762
Binkie, isn't it?

31:05.362 --> 31:07.242
And does he eat anything unusual?

31:08.922 --> 31:10.402
He ate a button once.

31:12.402 --> 31:14.722
But it came straight out the
other end.

31:14.722 --> 31:17.442
And what about exercise?

31:17.442 --> 31:20.722
And how old is this little lass?

31:20.722 --> 31:22.242
Speak up, Pen.

31:29.002 --> 31:31.602
And what can you tell me
about this little chap?

31:31.602 --> 31:32.762
He's a goldfish.

31:34.922 --> 31:36.682
Or Carassius auratus.

31:36.682 --> 31:38.202
He's only a year old,

31:38.202 --> 31:41.482
but goldfish have been known to live
up to 30 years in captivity.

31:41.482 --> 31:44.442
His diet mainly consists of fish
food pellets,

31:44.442 --> 31:47.322
but he can also be fed boiled peas
and brine shrimp.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.962
Well, I think we have a winner.

31:51.562 --> 31:53.722
Thank you, Mr Foyle.

31:53.722 --> 31:57.242
Now in third place, number ten,
the kitten.

31:57.242 --> 31:59.002
Well done, love.

31:59.002 --> 32:03.482
In second place, number 15,
the ferret.

32:03.482 --> 32:06.162
And in a very well deserved
first place...

32:08.442 --> 32:11.722
..number six, the goldfish.

32:16.562 --> 32:19.882
Well, my congratulations
to the winners and thank you,

32:19.882 --> 32:21.442
everyone for taking part.

32:22.682 --> 32:24.282
Absolute disgrace.

32:24.282 --> 32:26.442
Oh, sorry. Sorry, if I can...

32:27.882 --> 32:30.482
Sorry, excuse me. Miss Alderson.

32:32.722 --> 32:35.402
Well, I suppose that didn't go
too badly.

32:35.402 --> 32:37.402
I'm sorry, Mr Foyle, I really can't
talk now.

32:37.402 --> 32:38.762
Excuse me. Thank you.

32:38.762 --> 32:40.522
Helen?

32:55.362 --> 32:58.522
It was the pet show that did it
for you.

32:58.522 --> 32:59.962
Don't be too hard on yourself,

32:59.962 --> 33:02.162
it's no mean feat lasting as long as
you did.

33:03.242 --> 33:04.602
It wasn't the pets.

33:04.602 --> 33:05.642
What then?

33:08.642 --> 33:11.802
I'm fairly certain Helen's bull
has a problem

33:11.802 --> 33:13.602
and Dobson won't give me
a straight answer

33:13.602 --> 33:15.442
as to whether his cows are in calf
or not.

33:15.442 --> 33:17.642
Well, if they were, you'd assume
he'd just say?

33:17.642 --> 33:18.682
Exactly.

33:19.682 --> 33:22.282
I gave Helen my word that I'd vouch
for Clive.

33:34.242 --> 33:37.522
Look, there's no guarantee Southwick
will actually want to buy him in.

33:37.522 --> 33:40.402
She only goes for the very
top beasts. Best in show.

33:40.402 --> 33:41.922
Maybe Clive won't win.

33:41.922 --> 33:43.602
Maybe Southwick will buy
some other bull

33:43.602 --> 33:45.162
and you can live to fight
another day.

33:45.162 --> 33:47.842
You're right.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.682
What if you're not?

33:50.682 --> 33:51.802
What if he wins?

33:51.802 --> 33:53.122
Hide in here.

33:53.122 --> 33:55.322
It's what I do whenever there's
someone or something

33:55.322 --> 33:56.482
that I want to avoid.

33:56.482 --> 33:57.762
That seems rather cowardly.

33:57.762 --> 33:59.722
Just because there's a firing squad
lined up,

33:59.722 --> 34:02.002
doesn't mean you have to go and
stand in front of it.

34:02.002 --> 34:05.482
Tristan, where the bloody hell
are you?

34:05.482 --> 34:06.962
Speaking of which.

34:14.242 --> 34:16.722
The prize giving for the
bull contest

34:16.722 --> 34:18.602
will commence in five minutes,

34:18.602 --> 34:19.802
that's five minutes.

34:25.882 --> 34:29.122
Steady on now, Clive, old man.

34:29.122 --> 34:30.322
Steady.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.762
Steady,

34:32.762 --> 34:34.362
that's it,

34:34.362 --> 34:36.122
that's it.

34:36.122 --> 34:37.562
OK.

34:37.562 --> 34:39.162
I just want to take a look at you.

34:45.082 --> 34:46.122
CLIVE HOWLS

34:48.842 --> 34:49.882
Damn.

34:51.042 --> 34:52.082
James.

34:56.082 --> 34:58.402
So, I take it you know?

34:58.402 --> 35:00.122
Dobson was complaining about
his herd.

35:00.122 --> 35:02.322
I just didn't want him to put off
the Alderson's buyer.

35:02.322 --> 35:04.002
They can't sell an animal
that isn't fit.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.562
Well, we don't know that for sure.
I'm pretty sure.

35:08.042 --> 35:09.082
All right.

35:11.242 --> 35:14.442
But I'm asking you to keep it
to yourself.

35:14.442 --> 35:16.482
Not for me...

35:16.482 --> 35:17.522
..for Helen.

35:18.882 --> 35:20.682
She trusts you.

35:20.682 --> 35:23.642
And if you care about her at all,
then you won't let her down.

35:31.359 --> 35:32.399
I missed again.

35:32.399 --> 35:33.839
It's cheating,

35:33.839 --> 35:37.319
that's what it is, I'm not paying
sixpence for a broken rifle.

35:37.319 --> 35:39.359
I told you, them's the rules.

35:40.559 --> 35:41.639
What's going on?

35:41.639 --> 35:44.839
My gun didn't work, but he still
won't give me my money back.

35:44.839 --> 35:46.039
Is that right?

35:46.039 --> 35:47.719
That's what they all say.

35:47.719 --> 35:49.919
Makes no difference.

35:49.919 --> 35:52.239
Perhaps I'll take a turn.

35:52.239 --> 35:53.759
That'll be sixpence.

36:09.119 --> 36:10.159
When you're ready.

36:23.679 --> 36:25.639
The plaster must stay on for
two weeks.

36:26.679 --> 36:28.879
By rights, I should keep him
in overnight,

36:28.879 --> 36:29.879
but as you're not local...

36:29.879 --> 36:30.919
Oh, no, no.

36:30.919 --> 36:33.199
I wouldn't know what to do with
myself without him.

36:33.199 --> 36:36.719
Just me and him, see, since the
wife died.

36:36.719 --> 36:38.999
He was her pride and joy, he was.

36:40.039 --> 36:41.439
There's no charge.

36:44.359 --> 36:45.959
I'm so very grateful, Mr Farnon.

36:45.959 --> 36:47.199
Not at all, not at all.

36:47.199 --> 36:50.439
Just, in future, if you must tie
him up,

36:50.439 --> 36:51.759
make sure it's somewhere safe.

36:51.759 --> 36:52.959
Thank you.

36:54.759 --> 36:55.999
Mr Herriot.

37:01.839 --> 37:03.119
Right, I don't know about you,

37:03.119 --> 37:04.999
but I need a drink.

37:04.999 --> 37:09.239
Unless you're still avoiding
the refreshment hall?

37:09.239 --> 37:10.759
I'm sure I'll manage.

37:16.679 --> 37:18.199
Well, I never.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.439
Mrs Hall's a crack shot.

37:19.439 --> 37:20.599
Who'd have thought it?

37:24.319 --> 37:26.879
Where on Earth did you learn to
shoot like that?

37:26.879 --> 37:29.079
What did you think we did in
the WRENS?

37:29.079 --> 37:30.079
Embroidery?

37:31.479 --> 37:33.279
Right, drinks.

37:33.279 --> 37:34.839
Thank you, Mrs Hall.

37:34.839 --> 37:38.199
JUDGE: Mr Alderson with Clive!

37:38.199 --> 37:39.759
APPLAUSE

37:43.919 --> 37:45.639
A round of applause for the winner.

37:57.319 --> 37:58.919
Pint and half of best please.

37:58.919 --> 37:59.999
Coming right up.

38:01.239 --> 38:02.279
Ah.

38:04.719 --> 38:08.439
So, is your friend no longer
with us?

38:08.439 --> 38:10.679
No. She had to get back.

38:10.679 --> 38:11.879
Ah, yes.

38:16.479 --> 38:18.959
I found it lying on the ground,
Mr Herriot.

38:18.959 --> 38:21.159
It was creating a serious
trip hazard.

38:21.159 --> 38:22.319
I'm sorry.

38:22.319 --> 38:27.839
Yes, well, look, I realise this was
your first time, but if I can...

38:27.839 --> 38:30.239
Oh, I'm very sorry to interrupt.

38:30.239 --> 38:33.319
But I'm afraid James is needed
at the bar.

38:33.319 --> 38:35.159
I think you owe me a pint for
that one.

38:36.759 --> 38:38.159
Ah, won't be a minute.

38:42.079 --> 38:44.239
Hello, there, stranger.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.839
How was the open house?

38:45.839 --> 38:47.999
Yes, yes, good. Thanks.

38:50.879 --> 38:54.319
Maggie, I've been thinking and,

38:54.319 --> 38:59.319
this summer has been a lot of fun
and you're a really great girl.

39:00.999 --> 39:04.759
But the thing is, my final exams are
not far off

39:04.759 --> 39:08.439
and I'm going to be working all
hours and...

39:08.439 --> 39:11.919
You're giving me the push?

39:11.919 --> 39:16.879
No, no, no, not at all, far from it,
I just...

39:16.879 --> 39:18.639
Give over, will you?

39:18.639 --> 39:20.399
You're a nice enough lad, Tristan,

39:20.399 --> 39:22.239
but...

39:22.239 --> 39:26.199
..it's not like we'd have ever
been serious.

39:26.199 --> 39:27.399
Right.

39:30.799 --> 39:31.839
Why's that, then?

39:32.999 --> 39:35.159
James?

39:35.159 --> 39:37.679
Ah, there you are, this is
Mr Herriot.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.439
Vet I were telling you about.

39:39.439 --> 39:40.559
How do?

39:40.559 --> 39:41.839
Southwick.

39:41.839 --> 39:44.199
I hear you can vouch for this bull
of theirs, is that right?

39:44.199 --> 39:46.919
Cos I'd like a professional opinion
before I hand over good money.

39:46.919 --> 39:48.279
Right, yes.

39:49.839 --> 39:52.519
Come on, lad, time's money,
just say the word

39:52.519 --> 39:54.479
and we'll have ourselves a deal.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.479
I'd really like to examine
him first,

39:56.479 --> 39:58.319
rule out any possible problems.

39:58.319 --> 40:00.119
What sort of problems?

40:00.119 --> 40:01.399
There are no problems.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.159
Here, you can...you can ask Dobson,
he's got no complaints,

40:04.159 --> 40:06.359
his cows are all pregnant,
like they should be.

40:06.359 --> 40:07.999
Is that right, Mr Dobson?

40:07.999 --> 40:10.639
Can you say for certain that your
cows are in calf?

40:15.999 --> 40:19.119
Well, I don't know about
for certain.

40:19.119 --> 40:20.519
You what?

40:20.519 --> 40:25.319
I'm afraid, I noticed some swelling
on his spine

40:25.319 --> 40:26.919
and some signs of discomfort.

40:26.919 --> 40:28.599
You're saying the beast is lame?

40:30.639 --> 40:31.679
James?

40:38.279 --> 40:43.039
It's most likely intermittent and
very easily missed, yes.

40:45.359 --> 40:48.879
But Mr Dobson, if your cows
weren't in calf, why lie about it?

40:55.399 --> 40:58.199
Do you know something about this?

40:58.199 --> 40:59.239
Hugh?

41:01.799 --> 41:05.039
Dobson was grumbling about his herd
and it occurred to me that

41:05.039 --> 41:06.559
it would be better off all round

41:06.559 --> 41:08.399
if he just kept his complaints
to himself.

41:08.399 --> 41:11.479
So, I slipped him a few bob.

41:11.479 --> 41:13.959
Of all the bloody stupid...

41:18.559 --> 41:20.079
What were you thinking?

41:32.119 --> 41:35.079
Helen, I only wanted to help.

41:35.079 --> 41:38.079
Well, now the sale is off and you've
made my dad out to be a liar.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.039
So, thank you.

41:40.039 --> 41:42.279
I'd say he's cooked his goose,
wouldn't you?

41:44.679 --> 41:46.039
You can't imagine how hard it is,

41:46.039 --> 41:48.439
seeing you so terribly worried about
money all the time...

41:48.439 --> 41:49.639
That's no excuse...

41:49.639 --> 41:51.279
I know, but you won't let me
do anything.

41:51.279 --> 41:53.239
So you thought you'd go behind
my back?

41:53.239 --> 41:56.119
Because having money means you can
interfere in other people's lives?

41:56.119 --> 41:59.439
Because I'm too stupid to make my
own decisions?

41:59.439 --> 42:03.799
Because you're a man and you
know best?

42:03.799 --> 42:05.039
It's because I love you.

42:13.279 --> 42:15.319
Yep, he's a goner.

42:15.319 --> 42:18.119
You can tell from the body
language, see?

42:18.119 --> 42:19.319
I love you, Helen.

42:20.919 --> 42:24.159
And I would do anything in the world
to make you happy.

42:27.239 --> 42:29.679
You've never said that before.

42:29.679 --> 42:30.719
No, I know.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.879
But I should have.

42:33.879 --> 42:36.679
God knows I've wanted to.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.559
I'm just so hopeless at
these things.

42:38.559 --> 42:39.639
Oh, yes.

42:41.239 --> 42:42.279
You are.

42:55.879 --> 42:57.879
Jammy sod.

42:57.879 --> 43:00.519
How'd he manage to talk himself out
of that?

43:00.519 --> 43:04.119
I told him, I'm going to make
a formal complaint, I mean...

43:04.119 --> 43:07.079
You can't just ignore a certificate!

43:07.079 --> 43:09.239
I know my rights!

43:09.239 --> 43:10.559
A bloody goldfish.

43:10.559 --> 43:11.719
Aye, I ask you.

43:11.719 --> 43:13.919
Who's ever heard of a goldfish
winning a competition?

43:13.919 --> 43:15.159
I'll have you know,

43:15.159 --> 43:18.279
all I have done, all day,
and in the face of endless abuse

43:18.279 --> 43:23.159
and insult, I might add, is try to
make fair and just decisions.

43:23.159 --> 43:26.599
And I have to say, I have never in
my life witnessed such an

43:26.599 --> 43:30.359
appalling display of unsportsmanlike
and downright criminal behaviour!

43:30.359 --> 43:33.559
If anyone should be ashamed,
it's you lot!

43:33.559 --> 43:35.999
You might want to put down
the stick.

43:44.439 --> 43:46.999
Haven't you got a pint, young man?

43:49.719 --> 43:51.359
Cheaters shouldn't prosper.

43:57.679 --> 44:03.079
Well, James, I think we can safely
say you're one of us, now.

44:03.079 --> 44:04.119
I suppose so.

44:05.719 --> 44:07.519
I knew you could do it.

44:09.639 --> 44:10.719
Speaking of which.

44:10.719 --> 44:13.399
He's made it to 6:15, so...

44:14.959 --> 44:16.479
Two bob, wasn't it?

44:19.079 --> 44:20.799
You had a bet?

44:20.799 --> 44:22.319
Against me?

44:22.319 --> 44:23.879
More of a sweepstake.

44:23.879 --> 44:25.159
You could've warned me.

44:25.159 --> 44:26.679
Baptism of fire, old chap.

44:26.679 --> 44:28.279
Baptism of fire.

44:28.279 --> 44:31.199
The labours of Hercules pale in
comparison to being a vet

44:31.199 --> 44:32.599
at the Darrowby show.

44:34.639 --> 44:36.039
Cheers.
