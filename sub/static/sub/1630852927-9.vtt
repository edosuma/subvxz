WEBVTT

00:47.213 --> 00:50.884
Ma'am, are you awake?
This is the emergency room.

00:50.967 --> 00:54.512
One moment, please.
I'll call your guardian and your doctor.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.567
Yes, Presiding Judge Na. They ran tests,

01:07.650 --> 01:10.904
and we're just waiting for the results.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.073
About that…

01:13.865 --> 01:16.493
I looked into it too.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.707
<i>There was no information on her family.</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:24.084
NAME: SIM EUN-SEOK

01:24.167 --> 01:26.169
There's no emergency contact and…

01:28.338 --> 01:30.256
she's never really
talked about her family.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.801
-Judge Sim Eun-seok's guardian?
-Yes.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.427
She just woke up.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.515
I'll call you right back. Okay.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.394
How did you endure it all this time?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.021
It could have been far worse.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.566
-Are you her guardian?
-Yes, I am.

01:49.234 --> 01:53.113
Have you ever heard of burnout syndrome?
She burned out due to fatigue.

01:53.196 --> 01:58.076
She's suffering from malnutrition,
sleep deprivation, and high stress levels.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.329
She pushed herself
to the point of collapsing.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.124
Looking at these results,
I can't discharge her today.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.085
I'd like to keep her in the hospital
for a few days for observation.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.593
What happened?

02:16.636 --> 02:18.888
I should be the one asking you that.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.516
What happened?

02:21.599 --> 02:25.562
You just passed out
and gave everyone quite a scare.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.188
I did?

02:33.278 --> 02:35.446
YEONHWA POLICE STATION
HWANG IN-JUN

02:41.786 --> 02:44.497
I see, you must've been shocked.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.003
Judge Cha, could you please
call the nurse for me?

02:51.796 --> 02:52.797
Judge Sim.

02:53.798 --> 02:54.924
Judge Sim!

02:56.217 --> 02:58.803
Didn't you hear the doctor?
You can't go home.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.179
You're going to get sick.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.556
I know my own body.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.100
This is nothing.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.268
But…

03:08.396 --> 03:10.940
See? You need to get some rest.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.191
Please…

03:16.863 --> 03:18.448
I'll rest at the judges' quarters.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.230
You should get going.
Thanks for everything.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.732
You need to take your meds.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.400
Wait here.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.194
I'll go get some water.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.182
<i>Check your front door.</i>

06:13.206 --> 06:14.457
Hello, Judge Cha.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.750
Hello.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.837
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

06:32.600 --> 06:34.936
Judge Sim, you need to rest.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.856
Are you feeling better?

06:40.441 --> 06:41.442
Yes.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.821
There's something I needed to check.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.576
YEONHWA GANG RAPE CASE

06:50.660 --> 06:52.495
VICTIM, AGE 16, KANG SEON-A

06:52.578 --> 06:54.580
MISSING PERSON
NAME: KANG SEON-A

06:54.664 --> 06:57.583
We'll go on patrol right after
a few questions, so don't worry.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.503
What was your daughter last wearing?

07:02.213 --> 07:05.091
-It's done, let's go!
-I haven't taken a photo in so long.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.346
Seon-a.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.348
<i>I'm a truck driver.</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:18.354
I normally drive freight trucks
to the countryside,

07:19.522 --> 07:21.941
<i>so I leave the house for days at a time.</i>

07:22.733 --> 07:24.569
<i>Since I'm a single parent, I…</i>

07:24.652 --> 07:25.945
Where did she go?

07:27.155 --> 07:31.075
<i>When was the last time you talked to her?</i>

07:32.368 --> 07:33.453
What?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.501
Do you know where she hangs out
or who she's friends with?

07:41.210 --> 07:45.173
So she went to school today, right?

07:45.256 --> 07:48.342
<i>Yes, I reported it to the police.</i>

07:49.927 --> 07:52.638
<i>Is there anyone we can call?</i>

07:54.599 --> 07:55.892
That is…

07:57.393 --> 07:59.979
Well, I…

08:04.275 --> 08:07.487
MISSING PERSON
NAME: KANG SEON-A, AGE 16

08:07.570 --> 08:08.738
What do I do?

08:16.954 --> 08:20.500
Gosh, this again? I told them not to.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.568
What? Damn it.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.321
Damn it.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.533
Hello? I need an ambulance.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.952
There's someone passed out here.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.373
<i>The defendants are both minors
aged 16 and 17.</i>

09:00.873 --> 09:04.544
They met the victim online
and forced her to drink with them.

09:04.627 --> 09:08.756
It's a textbook example of gang rape.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.591
But…

09:11.175 --> 09:14.011
the last time you gave us
your statement, you said

09:14.095 --> 09:17.139
there were three people. Hwang In-jun,
Seo Dong-gyun, and O Gyeong-su.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.100
Now you're saying there's one more?

09:20.768 --> 09:22.770
Well, back then…

09:22.853 --> 09:27.525
She was just confused
because they forced her to drink!

09:28.109 --> 09:30.653
She's sure that there was
one more person there.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.488
Seon-a.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.491
Try to think carefully.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.911
If your statement isn't consistent,
it could work against you.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.586
<i>The victim, Kang Seon-a,
was intoxicated that day,</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:49.338
so she has no memory of the assault.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.301
And there were no security cameras
near the construction site,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.386
so we don't have any hard evidence.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.097
In the end, the prosecution only indicted

09:58.180 --> 10:01.058
Seo Dong-gyun, O Gyeong-su,
and Hwang In-jun.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.354
Fortunately, the victim was taken
to the hospital right after the assault

10:05.438 --> 10:09.692
and received a full checkup,
so they were able to get evidence.

10:10.359 --> 10:14.113
DNA of Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su,
who were drinking with her, was found.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.365
Thanks to that, we got their confessions.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.994
The problem is Hwang In-jun,
who was there at the scene.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.666
<i>I didn't know they were going to rape her.</i>

10:26.542 --> 10:28.586
I only found out
after we were done drinking.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.256
And I didn't even enter
the construction site.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.468
That's right. I even tried to stop them.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.638
I swear I did.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.098
The forensic results
and the DNA analysis gave weight

10:41.182 --> 10:44.602
to Hwang In-jun's claim
that he didn't take part in the assault.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.854
So his case was transferred here
as a protection case.

10:47.438 --> 10:51.108
His only charges are illegally purchasing
alcohol and forcing the victim to drink,

10:51.192 --> 10:53.486
so that's a violation of the Resident
Registration Act and coercion.

10:54.070 --> 10:58.658
The victim's father
reported this case early on,

10:58.741 --> 11:01.035
but the police delayed the investigation.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.331
As far as I know, it was only
after he made a national petition

11:05.414 --> 11:07.792
that the Yeonhwa Police Station
began investigating the case.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.793
That's right.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
I saw this case was
assigned to you, Judge Sim.

11:12.797 --> 11:16.092
Will you be okay?
You just got back from the hospital.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.178
Yes, it's fine.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.098
Judge Cha is in charge of
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su's case.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.475
-Make sure to look over it thoroughly.
-Yes, ma'am.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.043
Wait, I…

11:51.919 --> 11:54.338
I was just worried.
You didn't seem well back there.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.424
Just come out with it.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.092
No need to walk on eggshells.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.137
You probably won't like my question.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.683
Do you have any family?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.898
Well…

12:14.442 --> 12:16.610
I was a bit perplexed at the hospital.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.362
I looked at your records,

12:19.113 --> 12:22.408
but your family
or emergency contacts were all blank.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.453
And when I thought about it,

12:26.871 --> 12:30.082
I realized I knew nothing about you.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.712
I don't have any family.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.840
I abandoned them.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.269
Yes, this is Cha Tae-ju.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.981
Yes, Judge Lee.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.823
COUNSELING REPORT
HWANG IN-JUN (MALE)

13:02.907 --> 13:05.409
FATHER: HWANG U-JIN, 45
MOTHER: YANG MYEONG-IN, 40

13:05.493 --> 13:08.412
NOT IN CONTACT WITH PARENTS
SINCE THEIR DIVORCE AT THE AGE OF 10

13:13.959 --> 13:15.586
6 PRIOR PROTECTION CASES
SHOWS NO REMORSE

13:17.796 --> 13:21.759
THE VICTIM, KANG SEON-A, WAS ASSAULTED
PHYSICALLY AND SEXUALLY

13:25.262 --> 13:27.306
VICTIM, AGE 16, KANG SEON-A

13:29.808 --> 13:31.143
<i>Judge Sim Eun-seok?</i>

13:31.227 --> 13:32.436
I know her well.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.939
You do?

13:35.022 --> 13:37.483
We shared an office for a year or so.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.528
She was very talented.

13:40.611 --> 13:44.156
She took a leave of absence
not long after I transferred to Uijeongbu.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.784
That was five years ago.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.542
<i>We weren't working at the same court,
so I'm not sure,</i>

13:54.625 --> 13:56.919
<i>but I heard there was
some kind of an incident.</i>

13:57.002 --> 13:59.129
She ended up
divorcing her husband because of that.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.381
A divorce?

14:01.090 --> 14:04.093
Yes, I heard he's a prosecutor.

14:05.636 --> 14:09.056
<i>I don't have any family.</i>

14:10.057 --> 14:11.225
I abandoned them.

14:32.288 --> 14:36.876
How's the victim
of the Yeonhwa Gang Rape case doing?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.295
The victim Kang Seon-a

14:39.378 --> 14:43.048
has been receiving treatment
at an orthopedics clinic and an OBGYN.

14:43.799 --> 14:47.970
She's also been receiving therapy
for psychological trauma.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.598
And?

14:51.181 --> 14:53.392
Yes, and well…

14:55.728 --> 14:57.187
She's the self-harm patient
we called about.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.482
<i>The information about the victim
had been released online.</i>

15:00.566 --> 15:03.611
<i>She was suffering due to
social media posts and texts…</i>

15:03.694 --> 15:06.280
<i>I heard the school pressured
the victim to drop out.</i>

15:06.363 --> 15:07.573
<i>Eventually she…</i>

15:09.074 --> 15:11.160
Thankfully, her surgery was successful.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.414
VICTIM, AGE 16, KANG SEON-A

15:15.497 --> 15:16.832
Hwang In-jun…

15:19.043 --> 15:20.878
Let's hurry and set up a date.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.673
Contact his legal guardian too.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.639
I would like to let you know

15:31.722 --> 15:35.893
that we will give this case
our utmost attention and make it quick

15:35.976 --> 15:39.355
since it has been gathering
a lot of attention from the public.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.982
We will now begin the trial.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.235
Prosecutors, please submit your evidence.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.570
Yes, Your Honor.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.953
Has the defense checked the evidence?

15:54.036 --> 15:55.454
We have, Your Honor.

15:56.872 --> 16:00.125
Please share your opinion on the evidence.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.340
Yes?

16:09.009 --> 16:10.803
Presiding Judge Na
is looking for both of you.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.391
Have a seat.

16:18.310 --> 16:22.398
After looking at the evidence list
and the testimonies,

16:23.107 --> 16:24.525
I have a lot on my mind.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.488
Since this case is a serious issue,

16:30.072 --> 16:32.491
I thought it'd be better
if Judge Sim was the main judge

16:32.574 --> 16:33.951
since she has more experience.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.077
What do you think?

16:35.911 --> 16:37.121
Well…

16:37.204 --> 16:38.539
I don't mind.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.041
Just tell me if you're not feeling well.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.793
I'm not inflexible here.

16:42.876 --> 16:43.877
No, it's all right.

16:44.878 --> 16:49.508
Then you can hand over
the protection case to Judge Cha.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.639
-What?
-It'll be too much for you to handle both.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.182
No, I can do both.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.810
I'll take the protection case too.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.603
It'll be too much.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.938
Yes?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.275
Presiding Judge Na, it's time for
your committee schedule.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.735
Is it time already?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.780
Judge Cha will handle Hwang In-jun's case.
I made myself very clear.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.949
Wait, Presiding Judge Na!

17:20.289 --> 17:22.833
There's no need for you
to handle the protection case.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.710
I'll take care of it.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.171
I'll convince Presiding Judge Na.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.341
Presiding Judge Na isn't wrong.
If you overwork yourself--

17:31.425 --> 17:32.801
I said I'll do it!

17:39.975 --> 17:41.018
I'll do it.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.230
Is there a reason you're so adamant?

17:46.356 --> 17:50.319
I don't mind if you take this case,

17:50.402 --> 17:52.863
but you seem quite sensitive over it.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.073
Not at all.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.784
A case is a case.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.008
YEONHWA POLICE STATION

AS PART OF A SCHOOL PROJECT

He killed someone?

19:02.015 --> 19:07.062
THE VICTIM SUFFERED A BLOW TO THE SKULL

The judge in charge…

19:14.862 --> 19:19.324
JUDGE NA GEUN-HEE

19:22.119 --> 19:24.204
Are you getting off work now?

19:25.914 --> 19:26.957
It's pretty late.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.959
I was going to the office
to get some papers.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.712
Can you…

19:34.089 --> 19:35.632
give me five minutes?

19:39.344 --> 19:41.054
Juvenile cases are all about speed.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.640
Is this

19:44.933 --> 19:46.143
what you still think?

19:46.226 --> 19:49.313
I think juvenile cases
are all about speed.

19:49.396 --> 19:52.149
Do you know how many unsolved cases
there are in our department alone?

19:55.819 --> 19:57.613
Then please let me handle

19:59.072 --> 20:00.532
Hwang In-jun's case.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.869
-I was very clear--
-I'll close the case

20:04.494 --> 20:06.079
and send it back to the prosecution.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.665
Send it back?

20:08.749 --> 20:11.919
The main reason why the prosecution
didn't indict Hwang In-jun

20:12.002 --> 20:15.130
is because they weren't able to
find his DNA on the victim's body.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.800
But there was also the fact that
the victim couldn't remember him,

20:19.843 --> 20:24.348
and that there wasn't any evidence
that the assault was planned beforehand.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.060
But now we have the evidence.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.650
The protection case
will be due in a few days.

20:36.109 --> 20:39.321
I will announce at court
that we're sending back the case then.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.864
Since it was me who started it…

20:43.325 --> 20:45.035
I want to be the one to end it.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.583
Please, Presiding Judge Na.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.338
I don't want to let you.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.968
Didn't I tell you before?

21:02.344 --> 21:04.221
I can put up with dumb associate judges,

21:04.930 --> 21:06.807
but not arrogant ones.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.353
Are you the presiding judge?

21:16.191 --> 21:17.651
No, I'm not,

21:19.945 --> 21:21.071
That's why…

21:24.199 --> 21:25.867
I'm asking you.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.703
You don't ask for a case back,

21:28.495 --> 21:30.872
you discuss it.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.084
You thought it all through yourself,

21:34.668 --> 21:35.919
and now demand it back?

21:38.630 --> 21:40.507
Is this how you usually handle things?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.431
This conversation never happened.

22:00.569 --> 22:04.031
JUDGE CHA TAE-JU

22:07.868 --> 22:09.453
What is it about that case?

22:12.748 --> 22:16.668
It's because of the case
involving the brick, isn't it?

22:19.212 --> 22:22.174
You think this happened
because they were given

22:22.257 --> 22:24.551
a second chance as juvenile offenders.

22:24.634 --> 22:28.889
You think those kids
will assume they are above the law.

22:29.473 --> 22:34.269
That's why you're so desperate
to take this case, right?

22:38.231 --> 22:41.359
But what if that's just our assumption?

22:42.486 --> 22:46.239
What if it's just us who believe that
they're expecting they'll get off easy?

22:46.323 --> 22:50.994
If we look at this case independently
from their priors…

22:51.078 --> 22:53.246
What if he just got roped into it?

22:55.582 --> 22:58.752
We have to keep all possibilities open.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.588
-We're judges--
-That's all the more reason

23:01.671 --> 23:04.257
I need to take this case.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.902
It's a recording the police sent us.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.238
There was a recording?

23:26.321 --> 23:29.282
<i>Those guys made me call Seon-a.</i>

23:29.366 --> 23:30.784
<i>So I did.</i>

23:30.867 --> 23:34.454
<i>We just had a few drinks together
and she just came on to us.</i>

23:35.205 --> 23:39.668
They weren't planning on
getting her drunk and raping her.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.879
But drinking puts you in a good mood.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.007
They were going to ask for her consent,

23:46.842 --> 23:50.804
but she just passed out,
so we really didn't have to ask.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.223
That isn't…

23:55.225 --> 23:56.935
consent.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.356
"Consent"?

24:03.150 --> 24:05.902
You're right. I guess not.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.241
Mister, can I go home now?

24:12.117 --> 24:13.577
My parents will be worried.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.537
No, you can't.

24:17.998 --> 24:21.001
-Fuck, this is going to be good.
-I bet she tastes like ice cream.

24:21.084 --> 24:24.337
-Sex, sex, sex!
-Sex, sex, sex!

24:24.421 --> 24:29.134
<i>We were going to do it there at first,
but it was too exposed.</i>

24:30.385 --> 24:33.013
<i>People could show up from anywhere.</i>

24:33.096 --> 24:35.724
<i>So we took her to the construction site.</i>

24:35.807 --> 24:39.644
-Fuck, this is going to be good.
-<i>What do you mean by, "do it there"?</i>

24:39.728 --> 24:40.604
<i>What?</i>

24:40.687 --> 24:42.731
<i>What you just said.</i>

24:42.814 --> 24:47.068
<i>"We were going to do it there,
but people could show up."</i>

24:49.112 --> 24:50.572
I meant if we had sex there.

25:00.081 --> 25:03.543
We played rock-paper-scissors
to decide who will go first.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.671
So they went first
and then it was my turn.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.590
I was all prepared.

25:09.257 --> 25:12.844
I took off her clothes
and felt her breasts.

25:13.511 --> 25:17.557
But, damn…
Maybe it was because I was drunk.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.602
I couldn't get my dick up.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.317
You bastard.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.610
No, for real.

25:28.693 --> 25:33.156
The others were having a great time,

25:33.240 --> 25:36.409
but my dick wouldn't get hard,
so I couldn't fuck her.

25:38.119 --> 25:41.373
Is this all a joke to you?

25:42.749 --> 25:46.169
-You're laughing?
-Mister, do you know how that feels?

25:46.962 --> 25:49.172
Maybe you don't since she's your daughter.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.174
Is this a joke to you, you bastard!

25:52.300 --> 25:55.345
Tell me, you bastard!

25:56.012 --> 25:59.182
Is this a joke to you! Is it?

26:00.725 --> 26:03.186
How is this…

26:03.270 --> 26:04.604
You still think he just got roped into it?

26:04.688 --> 26:07.482
Why is this a protection case
when we have this recording?

26:07.565 --> 26:09.109
It wasn't accepted as evidence.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.653
He was forced to confess.

26:13.738 --> 26:19.119
The victim's father couldn't hold back
his anger and assaulted the boy,

26:19.202 --> 26:21.037
and his lawyer sued.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.373
Thanks to that,
the victim's father is in custody.

26:23.456 --> 26:27.794
While the victim is being taken care of
by her sister living in Seoul.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.546
But what I don't understand is

26:30.797 --> 26:34.092
why would he confess
when it could land him in jail?

26:34.175 --> 26:35.260
It's one or the other.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.596
That confession could've been planned

26:38.680 --> 26:40.765
to put the victim at a disadvantage…

26:43.018 --> 26:44.686
or he just has nothing to fear.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.443
He has seven priors already.

26:53.361 --> 26:54.779
Manslaughter…

26:57.699 --> 26:59.617
assault, theft…

27:01.036 --> 27:05.415
He's not afraid of the police
or the court after all that.

27:05.915 --> 27:10.211
He's got nothing to fear
even if he lands himself in a reformatory.

27:11.546 --> 27:15.091
Even if the statement can't be accepted
as evidence since it wasn't voluntary,

27:17.469 --> 27:19.846
we have to work
to make this a criminal case.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.484
<i>It started off on the wrong foot.</i>

27:37.447 --> 27:42.077
<i>If only he was sentenced properly
five years ago…</i>

27:48.375 --> 27:51.461
<i>when he was put on trial the first time.</i>

27:54.297 --> 27:58.134
<i>It's because no one made him realize</i>

27:59.552 --> 28:02.013
<i>how much damage he had done to the victim…</i>

28:06.518 --> 28:08.520
<i>and how he ruined the victim's life.</i>

28:10.438 --> 28:11.689
<i>That's why.</i>

28:45.598 --> 28:47.559
"Juvenile cases are all about speed."

28:48.977 --> 28:50.145
That does not mean

28:51.688 --> 28:54.482
you should cause a ruckus
by making a big deal out of it.

28:55.942 --> 28:58.737
It means the case should be handled
quickly and quietly.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.324
<i>I was in charge of his case five years ago</i>

29:03.992 --> 29:05.368
<i>but I don't even remember him.</i>

29:10.957 --> 29:12.751
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

29:14.252 --> 29:17.046
If it's an acceptable reason,
I'll reassign it to you.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.009
I detest

29:22.510 --> 29:23.595
young offenders.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.233
Go for it.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.905
I'm curious as to
how you will handle this.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.951
I'm going to
the senior presiding judge's office

29:48.369 --> 29:49.913
to report the reassignment.

29:50.914 --> 29:51.956
Okay.

29:53.374 --> 29:54.542
Just wait and see

29:55.752 --> 29:57.253
how I handle this case.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.432
Her mother ran away five years ago,

30:10.391 --> 30:12.560
and I've been
raising her alone ever since.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.773
And when she hit puberty, it got harder.

30:18.149 --> 30:22.403
If you give me another chance,
I will do my best to raise my daughter.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.406
Like hell.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.537
Ha-rin.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.665
Why do you think you're here?

30:34.457 --> 30:37.293
Because I stole cigarettes from a store.
Two cartons.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.129
Well…

30:41.089 --> 30:43.591
-I'd like to talk to her father alone.
-Okay.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.636
-Can you please escort Ha-rin out?
-Okay.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.721
Could her legal advisor also leave?

31:01.276 --> 31:04.821
Sir, how long has it been
since Ha-rin ran away from home?

31:06.030 --> 31:06.948
Pardon?

31:07.031 --> 31:09.951
Your answer will be extremely important.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.163
Hiding it won't make it go away.

31:16.499 --> 31:17.709
About two months.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.755
But it's all because of me.

31:23.673 --> 31:28.011
It's all my fault.
My daughter has done nothing wrong.

31:30.430 --> 31:35.101
Her mother ran away
when Ha-rin was in elementary school.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.856
I should've taken better care of her.

31:41.649 --> 31:44.277
I was always drunk
because I was having a hard time.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.739
When I got calls saying she got in trouble

31:48.239 --> 31:51.451
I only blamed her and told her

31:52.911 --> 31:54.245
she was just like her mom.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.664
I had done nothing for her.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.877
When I finally decided to do right by her,

32:00.960 --> 32:02.629
she had already grown up.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.091
She won't even answer me now.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.888
But when she just disappeared,

32:13.139 --> 32:14.349
I got scared.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.979
Sir, please try to calm down.

32:22.398 --> 32:25.401
I couldn't find her
no matter what I tried.

32:26.819 --> 32:30.198
Then I saw the court attendance notice

32:31.157 --> 32:35.036
and thought maybe I could meet her here.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.417
If you forgive us,

32:42.502 --> 32:44.754
I'll do everything I can.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.382
I have a younger brother in Gangwon-do.
We'll move there

32:48.341 --> 32:50.009
and I'll cook for her,

32:50.885 --> 32:52.428
send her to school,

32:53.179 --> 32:54.430
and get a new job.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.933
Yes.

32:57.725 --> 33:00.144
I understand what you're saying.

33:02.689 --> 33:03.690
But…

33:05.358 --> 33:09.237
I don't think Ha-rin can go home tonight.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.406
What?

33:11.489 --> 33:15.910
She'll go to a juvenile classification
center to be investigated.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.664
I'll decide on the sentence after that.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.416
No, Your Honor!

33:21.499 --> 33:25.503
Sir, please. For runaway kids,

33:25.586 --> 33:27.714
it's highly likely they'll run away again

33:28.548 --> 33:30.383
if I just send them back.

33:31.300 --> 33:34.178
I believe if Ha-rin runs away again,

33:35.304 --> 33:37.348
it'll be even more difficult to find her.

33:38.016 --> 33:42.353
It will be better for her emotionally

33:43.062 --> 33:46.232
if she goes to a juvenile classification
center instead of home

33:46.315 --> 33:48.985
to receive a physical checkup and therapy.

33:49.777 --> 33:52.739
We need to look into where
she got the money when she ran away,

33:52.822 --> 33:55.616
who she was with, why she ran away,

33:57.118 --> 33:59.746
and other pertinent details.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.045
This is Sim Eun-seok.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.090
Who?

34:22.477 --> 34:23.603
I clearly told you…

34:25.563 --> 34:26.731
Follow me.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.867
Are you out of your mind?

34:38.659 --> 34:39.994
What are you doing here?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.996
Why do you think I came all the way here?

34:42.747 --> 34:43.748
Hwang In-jun.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.667
Why are you in charge of his case?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.303
SLIDE TO ANSWER

34:58.221 --> 35:02.016
MISSED CALL

35:02.100 --> 35:06.771
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IGNORING ME?
FINE. LET'S SEE HOW THIS ENDS.

35:06.854 --> 35:09.148
"When a judge is someone
who has a relationship with

35:09.232 --> 35:11.025
the defendant,
the victim, or their family,

35:11.109 --> 35:13.402
they will be recused
from their execution of duties."

35:13.486 --> 35:16.531
You fit those grounds.

35:20.034 --> 35:23.329
Why do you care what case I handle?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.456
Why now?

35:25.540 --> 35:26.833
Why wouldn't I care?

35:28.793 --> 35:30.086
I'm Chan's father!

35:33.798 --> 35:34.841
Why?

35:35.842 --> 35:37.051
Is this revenge?

35:38.636 --> 35:40.555
Will that change anything?

35:40.638 --> 35:43.182
You'll only end up hurting yourself.
Why can't you see that?

35:43.266 --> 35:44.517
I don't care.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.270
I've already made up my mind.

35:47.353 --> 35:51.524
Apply for recusal
before things get out of hand.

35:51.607 --> 35:55.111
or I'll call the court myself.

35:55.778 --> 35:56.863
Back then…

36:00.366 --> 36:02.618
He shouldn't have gotten out like that.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.873
My son…

36:09.458 --> 36:11.252
ended up like that because of him.

36:11.961 --> 36:12.879
Why?

36:17.383 --> 36:18.467
Eun-seok.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.348
Just wait and see…

36:26.809 --> 36:28.060
how I handle…

36:30.396 --> 36:31.981
Hwang In-jun.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.333
Hey, Judge Sim.

36:59.550 --> 37:00.593
<i>Counsel.</i>

37:01.177 --> 37:03.596
You just said the same thing.

37:03.679 --> 37:06.432
You can't keep making claims
without any evidence.

37:06.515 --> 37:07.433
Prosecution--

37:09.227 --> 37:11.938
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's an emergency.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.754
I-HWAN
SLIDE TO ANSWER

37:36.837 --> 37:40.466
I-HWAN
MISSED CALL

37:44.387 --> 37:45.513
Chan.

37:48.307 --> 37:50.559
-A brick fell over here.
-I see.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.603
-The little kid got hit by the brick?
-Yes.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.730
-Please keep your distance.
-Oh, dear.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.983
-Please back off.
-Was he taken to the hospital?

37:57.066 --> 37:59.235
-Oh my, he must have died.
-Please back off.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.407
Taxi!

38:07.410 --> 38:09.287
Please wait!

38:12.081 --> 38:13.708
Sir.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.334
Please give me a ride.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.544
Sir!

38:19.213 --> 38:21.465
Taxi!

38:33.019 --> 38:36.147
Sir, please give me a ride.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.231
What the hell?

38:37.315 --> 38:39.066
-Please give me a ride!
-Are you crazy?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.943
-Let go!
-I have to get to my kid.

38:41.027 --> 38:41.944
Sir!

39:22.985 --> 39:24.320
Chan.

39:59.271 --> 40:01.774
COURT

40:32.096 --> 40:33.305
<i>I'll show him</i>

40:34.181 --> 40:36.350
how scary the law is.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.185
I will teach him.

40:40.604 --> 40:41.856
I'll show him that

40:44.233 --> 40:46.610
there are consequences to harming others.

40:49.697 --> 40:50.906
Just wait and see.

40:53.075 --> 40:55.161
I will make sure
he gets sentenced properly.

41:10.342 --> 41:14.013
COURT

41:20.811 --> 41:22.813
Everyone, please sit.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.994
Case number 2022 P3409.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.580
The trial is now in session.

41:44.418 --> 41:47.755
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

41:53.427 --> 41:54.386
Hwang In-jun.

41:56.305 --> 41:57.431
Why are you here?

41:59.642 --> 42:03.479
Violation of the Resident
Registration Act and coercion.

42:09.818 --> 42:12.696
You bought alcohol at
a convenience school with a fake ID

42:12.780 --> 42:16.325
and threatened the victim that
you wouldn't let her go unless she drank.

42:17.117 --> 42:21.080
and that you would spread rumors
on social media that she slept with you.

42:22.248 --> 42:23.249
You threatened her.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.463
Did you repent?

42:31.924 --> 42:32.925
Yes.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.847
This case happened because of
the power dynamics in their group.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.725
He met Seo Dong-gyun and
O Gyeong-su at a juvenile facility.

42:41.809 --> 42:46.397
They have been making him buy alcohol
and cigarettes for a long time.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.650
They would beat him if he refused.

42:54.154 --> 42:58.576
This incident happened because
he was afraid of being beaten up

42:58.659 --> 43:01.287
and he is deeply reflecting on himself.

43:04.331 --> 43:06.166
You did it because
you were afraid of them?

43:07.334 --> 43:08.502
Yes.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.841
You're Hwang In-jun's
legal guardian, right?

43:15.134 --> 43:17.011
Did you really not know?

43:17.678 --> 43:21.724
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.353
Okay, I got it.

43:28.522 --> 43:30.899
I'm going to ask you one more question.

43:31.442 --> 43:35.029
Depending on that answer, I'll decide
if we'll set another date for a trial

43:35.696 --> 43:37.781
or if I'll just sentence you today.

43:47.291 --> 43:48.792
There's something I'm curious about.

43:51.503 --> 43:55.799
You were loyal to them
because you were afraid of them,

43:57.009 --> 43:59.428
so how were you able to
defy them this time?

44:04.558 --> 44:06.018
According to the records,

44:06.101 --> 44:09.563
you didn't even enter the crime scene
and you tried to stop them.

44:12.399 --> 44:16.028
You did everything they asked
because you were afraid of them,

44:17.112 --> 44:19.031
so how did you…

44:21.575 --> 44:23.160
refuse this time?

44:28.832 --> 44:30.959
He was indeed afraid of their abuse--

44:31.043 --> 44:32.336
Because it was preposterous.

44:34.588 --> 44:35.798
I just couldn't see…

44:40.135 --> 44:42.012
how anyone could do such a thing…

44:45.057 --> 44:46.225
to another human being.

45:01.365 --> 45:05.536
You do know what happens
if you lie in court, right?

45:07.704 --> 45:08.956
I'm going to ask you one last time.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.791
Counsel, do not answer for him.

45:15.170 --> 45:16.422
Hwang In-jun.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.884
Did you really not enter the crime scene?

45:22.511 --> 45:23.470
No.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.348
And did you really stop them?

45:26.432 --> 45:27.683
Yes.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.106
Witness.

45:37.359 --> 45:39.528
I'm Detective Ko Gang-sik of
the Women & Juvenile Affairs Division

45:39.611 --> 45:42.448
at Yeonhwa Police Station
and I'm in charge of this case.

45:43.740 --> 45:47.578
I heard you're in charge of
the Yeonhwa Gang Rape case.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.121
That's right.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.540
About the recording
the victim's father submitted…

45:53.125 --> 45:54.501
I can't get it off my mind.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.836
Well…

45:55.919 --> 45:58.088
I heard it can't be accepted as evidence.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.131
I know.

46:00.549 --> 46:03.552
What if there was evidence

46:04.845 --> 46:06.346
other than the DNA?

46:22.613 --> 46:24.156
-Do it again.
-Again.

46:24.239 --> 46:25.491
Again. Rock-paper-scissors!

46:25.574 --> 46:26.617
Okay! Drink!

46:26.700 --> 46:28.535
You suck at rock-paper-scissors.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.370
Seriously.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.873
You lost, so drink.

46:32.956 --> 46:35.125
-Who wants to go first?
-She's heavy.

46:35.209 --> 46:37.503
Go up. Up.

46:38.545 --> 46:39.630
That way.

46:41.632 --> 46:43.342
Fuck.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.306
Damn it.

46:51.099 --> 46:52.267
-She's out.
-She's out?

46:52.351 --> 46:53.936
Fuck.

46:54.019 --> 46:55.562
Rock-paper-scissors, you idiot.

46:55.646 --> 46:56.730
Let's do this!

46:56.813 --> 46:58.065
Rock-paper-scissors.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.149
Fuck! Damn it!

46:59.233 --> 47:00.776
Hurry!

47:01.485 --> 47:03.403
In-jun, did you get this?

47:22.214 --> 47:23.799
Can I ask you a few things?

47:23.882 --> 47:25.050
Do you park here

47:25.133 --> 47:26.885
-around this time every day?
-<i>I'd like to submit</i>

47:26.969 --> 47:28.262
the dashcam footage of the car

47:28.345 --> 47:30.597
that was parked
near the construction site as evidence.

47:39.523 --> 47:40.607
<i>Again. Rock-paper-scissor!</i>

47:41.984 --> 47:43.235
<i>Fucking drink already.</i>

47:43.318 --> 47:44.236
<i>Drink.</i>

47:44.319 --> 47:45.654
<i>Hurry up and drink.</i>

47:45.737 --> 47:50.450
Dashcam footage was retrieved
from a taxi that was parked nearby

47:50.534 --> 47:54.246
but it was omitted in the investigation
as the taxi was operating at the time.

47:54.329 --> 47:55.622
<i>Drink up.</i>

47:55.706 --> 47:57.332
<i>Fuck. Drink it all at once.</i>

47:57.416 --> 47:58.417
<i>Yes, let's drink!</i>

47:58.500 --> 48:00.127
<i>Gosh, you okay?</i>

48:00.836 --> 48:02.254
-Drink.
-You lunatic.

48:02.337 --> 48:03.755
Fuck, why…

48:04.298 --> 48:05.132
Hey.

48:05.215 --> 48:06.216
Are you drunk?

48:06.925 --> 48:09.177
She got fucking drunk from that?
That won't do.

48:09.261 --> 48:10.804
-How could she pass out?
-Seon-a!

48:10.887 --> 48:11.847
Move it.

48:12.889 --> 48:14.808
-Hey, Seon-a.
-Fuck!

48:14.891 --> 48:17.185
-Push.
-Seon-a!

48:17.269 --> 48:18.353
What do you think you're doing?

48:18.437 --> 48:19.730
You shouldn't.

48:19.813 --> 48:22.608
You idiot. We came too far to stop now.

48:22.691 --> 48:24.901
Then I tried to stop you, right? Fuck.

48:32.451 --> 48:33.535
Fuck.

48:33.619 --> 48:35.537
The footage could have been tampered with.

48:35.621 --> 48:38.373
This is a document from the video analysis
team at National Forensic Service.

48:38.457 --> 48:41.043
It says the footage wasn't tampered with.

48:45.797 --> 48:48.216
WE HAVE VERIFIED THAT THE DASHCAM FOOTAGE
HAS NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH

48:51.094 --> 48:52.554
I warned you

48:52.638 --> 48:55.641
that lying will only make things worse.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.816
This proves that

49:04.900 --> 49:09.655
Hwang In-jun's statement
saying that he tried to stop

49:09.738 --> 49:13.033
Seo Dong-gyun and O Gyeong-su
and that he never entered the crime scene

49:13.950 --> 49:15.869
is a lie.

49:17.412 --> 49:22.417
So this raises the possibility that all of
Hwang In-jun's statements could be a lie.

49:22.501 --> 49:26.505
And you saw in the footage,
it's possible Hwang In-jun,

49:27.297 --> 49:30.509
who entered the construction site,
could be an accomplice.

49:31.009 --> 49:33.929
Starting now, Hwang In-jun will be sent to

49:34.721 --> 49:37.265
a juvenile classification center
for additional investigation.

49:38.058 --> 49:39.976
The next trial will be in three weeks.

49:40.060 --> 49:43.146
If you make false statements again
during the next trial

49:45.273 --> 49:50.028
or if circumstances reveal that he was
an accomplice in the sexual assault,

49:51.196 --> 49:52.239
this case…

49:54.533 --> 49:56.326
can be sent to the prosecution.

49:57.828 --> 49:58.995
Fuck.

50:03.458 --> 50:04.418
Court…

50:07.337 --> 50:08.714
will be adjourned.

50:31.361 --> 50:33.530
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

50:33.613 --> 50:34.656
Yes, that's right.

50:36.408 --> 50:37.367
What?

50:38.869 --> 50:42.038
One second please.
I'll check and let you know.

50:42.789 --> 50:44.082
Don't send her up just yet.

50:48.670 --> 50:51.882
Is Judge Sim here yet?

50:52.549 --> 50:55.135
Someone's waiting for her in the lobby.

50:55.969 --> 50:57.804
But is Judge Sim married?

50:58.472 --> 50:59.431
Married?

51:04.686 --> 51:06.772
-Judge Sim.
-Yes?

51:06.855 --> 51:08.064
What's going on?

51:08.774 --> 51:10.650
The Yeonhwa Gang Rape.

51:11.318 --> 51:14.154
What Seon-a said might be true.

51:15.489 --> 51:19.201
-What?
-There may be four boys, not three.

51:20.076 --> 51:22.037
Seo Dong-gyun, O Gyeong-su, Hwang In-jun,

51:23.246 --> 51:24.831
and Baek Do-hyeon.

51:29.336 --> 51:31.546
<i>The kid who was with Hwang In-jun</i>

51:32.380 --> 51:34.424
when he threw the brick five years ago.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.053
That Baek Do-hyeon.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.241
Judge Sim!

52:00.283 --> 52:02.410
Why are you ignoring my texts?

52:02.494 --> 52:03.870
I warned you

52:05.038 --> 52:06.456
that I would find you.

52:07.123 --> 52:08.542
You can't hide forever.

52:13.505 --> 52:14.881
This is a courthouse.

52:15.882 --> 52:18.260
Let's go and talk outside.

52:19.427 --> 52:20.387
Can't you see?

52:21.137 --> 52:22.681
I came here to cause a scene.

52:23.723 --> 52:25.809
If you got a divorce,
that should be the end of it.

52:25.892 --> 52:29.980
Why do you keep meeting my son
who finally got over you?

52:33.984 --> 52:35.026
Let's go.

52:35.610 --> 52:37.362
-We'll talk outside.
-Let go of me!

52:38.238 --> 52:42.325
I told you a million times to quit,
and that a child needs his mother.

52:42.909 --> 52:45.871
But you still put him
under the care of others.

52:45.954 --> 52:49.249
That's why he died.

52:49.332 --> 52:51.418
Because of some brick
that fell out of the sky!

52:52.002 --> 52:55.714
My son had a blind date and
finally set a date to get remarried.

52:55.797 --> 52:57.757
Even that went down the drain
because of you!

53:02.012 --> 53:05.473
-This is why you should be careful!
-Please stop. Let's talk outside.

53:05.557 --> 53:08.143
-I didn't like you from the start.
-Ma'am.

53:08.226 --> 53:10.687
-Calm down.
-You cursed our family!

53:10.770 --> 53:13.315
-You should have been the one who died!
-Please, stop.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.692
What the hell did we do that was so wrong?

53:16.443 --> 53:18.945
What did we ever do to deserve this?

53:19.029 --> 53:20.989
Ma'am, please come this way.

53:35.337 --> 53:37.005
-Ms. Joo.
-What?

53:37.672 --> 53:39.758
Did you hear? Judge Sim's mother-in-law…

53:39.841 --> 53:41.927
Mother-in-law? What are you talking about?

53:42.010 --> 53:44.846
I just heard. She caused
a huge scene in the lobby.

53:44.930 --> 53:45.889
Did you know?

53:45.972 --> 53:49.100
-I didn't even know she was married.
-What?

53:49.184 --> 53:53.396
Anyway, her mother-in-law came
to the lobby

53:53.480 --> 53:55.774
-and slapped Judge Sim.
-What?

53:55.857 --> 53:58.693
She was talking about divorce
and whatnot. It was a mess.

53:59.486 --> 54:01.404
Is Judge Sim okay?

54:01.488 --> 54:05.075
I don't know. Anyway,
the whole court is talking about this.

54:05.742 --> 54:09.079
Gosh, she did a great job at the trial,
and now this? What a mess.

54:09.162 --> 54:13.083
Presiding Judge Na is out of the office
all day because of the seminar, right?

54:49.619 --> 54:50.620
Eun-seok.

54:52.372 --> 54:53.832
I don't want to hear a word.

54:56.251 --> 54:58.753
I'll apologize for what my mom did.

54:59.754 --> 55:01.881
I'll make sure nothing like this
happens again.

55:03.091 --> 55:04.092
How?

55:06.094 --> 55:07.470
How are you going to do that?

55:10.682 --> 55:12.058
This isn't the first time.

55:14.894 --> 55:16.980
The problem isn't your mother.

55:17.731 --> 55:18.690
It's you.

55:22.068 --> 55:25.488
Why is it…

55:28.283 --> 55:29.451
that your worries…

55:32.912 --> 55:34.581
always make me so miserable?

55:42.756 --> 55:44.174
Don't ever come here again.

55:46.176 --> 55:48.636
Don't ever show yourself
in front of me. Please.

58:56.991 --> 59:00.411
THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS
