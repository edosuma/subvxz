00:01.126 --> 00:07.257
(film camera flicker)

00:12.429 --> 00:16.099
(soft haunting piano music)

00:21.396 --> 00:26.401
(man softly grunting)
(car seat softly rubbing)

00:32.156 --> 00:32.991
- No.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.618
Douglas-

00:35.618 --> 00:37.245
- I'm trying, I'm,

00:39.080 --> 00:39.914
I'm trying...

00:42.792 --> 00:44.335
I don't want you to think
this is about you at all.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.628
Has nothing to do about you.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.422
Don't think about it's
about you for a second.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.298
It's not about you.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.468
- It's kinda hard not to when...

00:53.970 --> 00:56.473
- What can I do about it?

00:56.473 --> 00:59.184
- I don't know, maybe that's
one you can figure out.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.812
(soft haunting piano music)

02:04.374 --> 02:06.376
- You open up,
I'll grab the bags.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.211
- That's way too much.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.419
- I got it.

02:09.419 --> 02:10.588
- Just give me the
chips at least, come on.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.090
- You can have the chips,

02:12.090 --> 02:13.049
or just take your purse or I'm
not gonna carry it anymore.

02:13.049 --> 02:13.883
- Okay.

02:22.851 --> 02:26.521
(soft haunting piano music)

02:50.128 --> 02:52.714
- Hey, Vee, where's my suitcase?

02:52.714 --> 02:54.382
- [Veronica] I brought
it downstairs, babe.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.925
I had to get ready.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.262
- Okay.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.432
- [Veronica] Dan's
gonna be here soon,

03:02.432 --> 03:03.600
I wanted to get changed.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.061
- Okay.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.443
- [Veronica] You want
me to bring it up?

03:13.443 --> 03:14.777
- No, I'm good, thank you.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.410
(soft piano music)

03:56.319 --> 03:57.654
Yay.
- Hi

03:59.656 --> 04:02.116
- So Donna found
that photo of us.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.452
I thought we lost it.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.703
- Which one?

04:05.703 --> 04:07.330
- The one from the
trip before last.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.962
I was, I thought it was gone.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.713
Just found it behind the futon.

04:15.713 --> 04:16.547
- Oh.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.885
- If I was gonna
lift, was gonna lift

04:20.885 --> 04:23.012
and I'm gonna finish
that script on this trip,

04:23.012 --> 04:24.013
I can just feel it.

04:25.848 --> 04:26.683
- Hope so.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.186
- Is it too late just to,

04:30.186 --> 04:33.064
just to have Dan go
back to Orange County?

04:33.064 --> 04:34.565
- You wanted him to come.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.025
- I didn't say yes.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.027
- Yeah, you didn't
say no either.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.154
And no decision is a decision.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.406
You don't want Pia
and Dan to come up,

04:41.406 --> 04:42.365
then you should said something.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.366
- I said nothing about Pia.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.203
- Oh, let me get that for you.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.207
- That came off too adamant.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.376
You're the only girl
for me, you know that.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.336
- Yeah, sure.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.882
(car softly honks)

05:01.843 --> 05:03.553
- Veronica!

05:03.553 --> 05:04.554
Pia, ready?
- Are we doing this again?

05:04.554 --> 05:06.222
- Veronica!
- Veronica!

05:06.222 --> 05:07.724
- [Veronica] Veronica!

05:07.724 --> 05:09.392
- Veronica!

05:09.392 --> 05:12.270
(soft piano music)

05:23.114 --> 05:24.240
Stop the press, hello.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.243
Jessica Rabbit, hey.

05:27.243 --> 05:30.955
Oh my god, you are a dream.
(Veronica softly laughs)

05:30.955 --> 05:31.789
Look at you.
- Hello, Douglas.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.249
- Smell nice.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.082
- Pia.

05:35.084 --> 05:35.960
- Hi!
- Hey!

05:37.754 --> 05:39.255
Hey.
- Hi, sweetie, how are you?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.214
- [Pia] Good, you?

05:43.718 --> 05:47.096
- Come here, you douchebag,
come here, missed you.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.890
Hey, babe, babe,
what I tell you?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.391
Bitch-in-love hug.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.101
Whoa, whoa, I'm kidding.

05:53.269 --> 05:56.105
So what are you doing,
you gonna invite us in?

05:56.105 --> 05:57.607
This guy all of a
sudden gets a hot wife

05:57.607 --> 05:58.900
and he's got no manners.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.109
- Was gonna help
you with the bag.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.153
- She's fine, look at
her, she's hot, look.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.280
This is for you.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.281
We know you don't
know shit about wine.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.491
- Dan.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.618
- He doesn't, so we
picked this out for you.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.663
- Who says I don't
know shit about wine?

06:12.663 --> 06:13.956
I know this wine.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.124
- "Who says I don't
know shit about,"

06:15.124 --> 06:16.584
no one has to say it, Dougie.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.296
This guy, you so cute, come
on, show me the house, come on!

06:20.296 --> 06:23.341
(cicadas softly buzzing)

06:23.341 --> 06:24.634
- Stop.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.803
- You can look, we know
you need to watch this.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.679
See what's happening here.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.306
Give him the neck.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.308
(softly kissing)
- Hey, baby, we can-

06:32.308 --> 06:34.102
- Okay, okay, you're awesome.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.771
To you, this has been amazing.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.980
- Yeah.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.982
- Dougie, you've found
a great one, cheers.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.195
- You're beautifully
dressed, as always.

06:44.195 --> 06:47.365
- She is, well, I just
got one question though.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.826
Doug, when are you
gonna do something

06:49.826 --> 06:51.494
about that shit
around your mouth?

06:51.494 --> 06:52.495
- [Pia] Dan.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.497
- What, babe, what?

06:54.497 --> 06:56.207
It's getting out of hand,
you said so in the car.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.501
- [Pia] No, I didn't.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.629
- Well, I happen to like it.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.672
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.965
- Doesn't bother you trying to

07:03.965 --> 07:06.384
find his lips through
all that shit?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.177
- Nah, she likes the bush.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.178
- She does?

07:09.178 --> 07:10.680
- Yeah.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.848
- Everyone likes a little
bush nowadays, right?

07:11.848 --> 07:13.182
- It's like a
picnic, you have to

07:13.182 --> 07:14.851
go through some
bush to get there.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.185
- He should shave the bush-

07:16.185 --> 07:17.687
- No, bad boy.
- It's better to go through.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.855
What's goin' on?

07:18.855 --> 07:20.690
Everyone likes a
little bush, huh, babe?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.066
- Stop it.
- Actually, there's nothing,

07:22.066 --> 07:23.192
she's clean as a.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.529
I love you.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.823
Hey, Dougie, you remember
the Wasserman account

07:28.823 --> 07:30.199
You remember that-
- Boo!

07:30.199 --> 07:31.993
What, what, what?
- Yeah, no, we said no.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.077
We said no-
- Oh, come on, no.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.078
- No.
- Are you serious?

07:34.078 --> 07:35.413
- We had one rule.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.706
- What's the rule?

07:36.706 --> 07:37.665
- [Douglas] You're
such a dick, dude.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.207
- You tell me what the rule was.

07:39.207 --> 07:40.877
No talking shop.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.213
- Are you serious about this?
- Or just no talking, period.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.673
- No talking?

07:45.673 --> 07:48.009
Geez, listen, Dougie, are
you sure you wanna hear this?

07:48.009 --> 07:49.218
- You're a dick.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.720
- Am I gonna tell
the story or not?

07:50.720 --> 07:51.846
- Carry on.
- Yes!

07:51.846 --> 07:53.598
Okay, this one Wasserman
account, right?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.057
I've been trying to
land this account

07:55.057 --> 07:57.058
for I don't know how long,
it was Dougie's lead,

07:57.058 --> 08:01.898
he couldn't land it, easy
150 grand a month, easy.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.399
Dougie couldn't land it because

08:03.399 --> 08:05.776
of Tim fucking McNealy, that
prick, remember that guy?

08:05.776 --> 08:08.946
- He worked at a different
copier place and he's a dick.

08:08.946 --> 08:11.407
- Yeah, well, yeah, but I
thought I was telling the story.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.617
Veer, I'm telling
the story, right?

08:12.617 --> 08:13.951
- Yes, go, go on.
- Baby, babe,

08:13.951 --> 08:15.077
can I finish the story?
- You have the floor.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.245
- Oh my gosh, keep going.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.123
- Thank you, so,
right, after you left,

08:19.123 --> 08:21.626
Rob passed it around people's
desks, didn't happen.

08:21.626 --> 08:25.087
Landed on my desk, like
a turd, what do I do?

08:25.087 --> 08:26.130
What do I do, babe?

08:26.130 --> 08:28.591
- I know the story, keep going.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.926
- Yeah, I go pay
Wasserman a visit, right,

08:29.926 --> 08:31.260
every time I get there,

08:31.260 --> 08:33.261
the jerk-off gatekeeper
says he's got no time.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.804
Every time, no time.

08:34.804 --> 08:38.601
So I wait a couple weeks, and
then, I do the unthinkable.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.102
Can I get a drum roll, please?

08:42.230 --> 08:43.438
I pull out the clipboard.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.775
- [Veronica] What's
with the clipboard?

08:45.775 --> 08:48.319
- Dougie, you wanna tell
'em or should I tell 'em?

08:48.319 --> 08:49.612
(Douglas softly mumbling)
Should I tell 'em?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.781
Let me tell 'em, let
me tell, okay, okay.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.449
One day, Doug's in some office,

08:53.449 --> 08:54.992
some schmuck's office,
I don't know who.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.620
These people, maintenance
people, walking through,

08:57.620 --> 09:01.415
holding a clipboard,
nobody says nothing, nada.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.334
They just let 'em walk right by.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.003
Dougie here gets the smart idea,

09:06.003 --> 09:09.131
he goes into Office Depot,
Office Depot, or was it...

09:09.131 --> 09:10.633
- Office Max.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.510
- Office Max, nobody stops
the guy with the clipboard,

09:12.510 --> 09:13.970
or a Mexican with
the leaf blower.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.972
- Oh, what?
- I can say that joke,

09:15.972 --> 09:18.808
because, listen, I can say
that joke, I'm half Mexican.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.309
You guys can't, you
will be canceled,

09:20.309 --> 09:22.853
I'm just stating facts.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.814
- What about a white
guy with a leaf blower?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.525
- Yes, this also works.

09:27.525 --> 09:31.112
Anyways, I got the clipboard,
I go right past that jerk-off.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.321
I'm in Wasserman's office

09:32.321 --> 09:34.031
and he walks in five
minutes later, right?

09:34.031 --> 09:35.157
- No way.
- Way.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.034
And we're doing the damn thing,

09:37.034 --> 09:39.787
three yeses, I'm in,
this guy won't commit.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.831
Whatever I do, he
will not commit.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.665
Had to give him
everything, everything.

09:43.665 --> 09:45.668
Almost had to let
Pia fuck him here.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.503
I was thinking I had to do it,

09:47.503 --> 09:49.630
and I almost thought I
was gonna do it, but,

09:49.630 --> 09:50.506
I kid, I kid, baby.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.674
- Aw!
- Yeah.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.883
- I would never let
him do that, well-

09:52.883 --> 09:53.676
- It's okay, maybe
I wanna do it.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.845
- Whoa, pause, babe.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.681
(soft ominous music building)

09:58.681 --> 10:00.516
Dougie knows though,
I don't lose.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.853
Dan Mackie never loses, never.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.026
So, I get this bright idea,

10:10.026 --> 10:12.528
my bulb goes off, I head
down to the corner store,

10:12.528 --> 10:13.738
I grab a deck of cards.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.197
Next meeting, I walk
in with five cards,

10:15.197 --> 10:17.867
Ace, King, Queen,
Jack, 10, all hearts.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.201
You know what that is,
tell 'em what it is.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.369
- I don't know.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.203
- You know, it's a
royal flush, say royal-

10:21.203 --> 10:22.663
- A flush.

10:22.663 --> 10:26.208
- It's a royal flush, whatever,
she's foreign, it's cool.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.211
You can call on any of my guys,

10:29.211 --> 10:32.173
anytime with this hand,
now make it happen.

10:32.173 --> 10:36.344
But each time he calls, I take

10:36.344 --> 10:37.094
one card,

10:39.347 --> 10:42.391
and when I finally
have five cards,

10:43.392 --> 10:45.519
I get to go all in and ask him

10:46.729 --> 10:48.731
for one favor and
he's gotta do it.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.899
We shook on it.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.067
It was a deal,
Dougie, you remember.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.112
So, (softly chuckling)

10:55.112 --> 10:57.281
he used his last
card on Wednesday.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.617
Me, I asked for my
favor yesterday.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.744
I asked for his business.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.080
And this morning,

11:05.247 --> 11:06.207
well, this morning,

11:07.083 --> 11:08.709
I closed that motherfucker!

11:08.709 --> 11:10.252
(Pia speaking French)
Fuck you,

11:10.252 --> 11:11.253
Timmy Fucking McNealy

11:11.253 --> 11:12.421
and that's how you do it.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.255
Can I get an amen?
(Pia speaking French)

11:13.255 --> 11:14.256
Can I get an amen, amen?

11:14.256 --> 11:15.633
- [Veronica] Amen.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.759
(Pia speaks French)

11:16.759 --> 11:18.427
- I'm sorry, right?

11:18.427 --> 11:19.762
Come on, that's a power move.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.806
Was that a Kanye move?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.432
I'm like Kanye.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.060
- That's, congratulations,
that's huge.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.313
- Yeah?

11:29.313 --> 11:30.940
You sound so enthused.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.442
- I, no, I don't mean,
I mean, congrats.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.820
- Congrats, that's huge?

11:38.489 --> 11:39.615
Tell me you miss it, Dougie.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.950
You miss it, right?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.827
You, don't flip me
off, you miss it.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.247
The rush you get, the
feeling of watching

11:46.247 --> 11:47.748
you eat another
cocksucker's lunch, right?

11:47.748 --> 11:48.999
- I don't want any
cocksuckers around.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.292
- I don't know, maybe this

11:51.627 --> 11:54.088
writing thing fills
that need, I don't know.

11:54.088 --> 11:58.134
- If I have a need to
be filled, it does.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.803
- So is that a yes?

12:03.305 --> 12:04.265
I don't know, man.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.102
Baby, are you seeing this?

12:09.311 --> 12:10.146
Who does he look like?

12:10.146 --> 12:10.980
- [Pia] Stop it.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.691
- You know else had that look?

12:14.650 --> 12:15.776
Gary did.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.489
Yeah, it's that look,
man, it's that hunger.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.991
If you don't do
something about it,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.492
it's gonna eat
you alive, Dougie.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.994
- Dan.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.163
- What, I'm just, look, all
I'm saying is Doug and me,

12:28.706 --> 12:29.707
we're like vampires.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.002
Eat another man's lunch,

12:35.004 --> 12:36.172
it's like blood to us.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.341
- Dan.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.676
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.

12:40.676 --> 12:41.510
All right, just,

12:43.137 --> 12:44.555
I'm done.

12:44.555 --> 12:49.185
Anyways, I need another
drink because I am thirsty.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.857
But seriously though,
can you get me a drink?

12:54.857 --> 12:55.858
Something stiff?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.026
- Okay-
I got it,

12:57.026 --> 12:58.527
I got it.
- Was it too much?

12:58.527 --> 12:59.737
- Okay.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.238
- I'm gonna get the
vampire's blood.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.491
- [Dan] Sorry about that.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.700
- That was stupid.

13:06.660 --> 13:10.206
- So, how's America's
favorite tart with a heart?

13:12.666 --> 13:15.211
- You know I hate
when you call me that.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.378
- What do you care for?

13:16.378 --> 13:17.213
- Dan.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.007
She doesn't like that.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.717
- Okay, all right, all
right, I'm sorry, but okay,

13:21.717 --> 13:24.553
you gotta admit my
favorite character,

13:24.553 --> 13:27.556
Kendall James, is a steel-jawed
cunt, let me finish,

13:27.556 --> 13:31.227
hiding behind that so gorgeous

13:31.227 --> 13:34.188
and immaculate,
wonderfully deceptive

13:36.023 --> 13:37.900
pretty case of whoever he was.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.236
Isn't it fun being
someone else for a living?

13:41.737 --> 13:43.030
- No, it was.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.407
Yeah.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.575
No, it, it was.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.579
I stepped down a few months ago.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.747
- Stepped down?

13:51.747 --> 13:53.457
Qu'est-ce que
c'est stepped down?

13:53.457 --> 13:54.290
You mean,

13:55.251 --> 13:56.085
you quit?

13:58.754 --> 14:00.422
- [Veronica] Yes.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.633
- Oh, Dougie. (softly chuckling)

14:02.633 --> 14:05.427
Your meal ticket here
just got punched, brother.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.721
Looks like you need
to get a real job.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.100
Can always come back with
me, or copier sales, huh?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.602
- Why did you step down?

14:13.602 --> 14:16.438
- 15 years on the show
started to get stale.

14:18.482 --> 14:22.278
- She's all out of love,
and so lost without you.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.281
- Besides, Douglas and
I are looking forward

14:25.281 --> 14:28.117
to a normal life,
normal schedule,

14:29.285 --> 14:31.412
spending more time together.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.622
And Douglas has been
working on his writing.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.001
- You hear that, Dougie?

14:37.001 --> 14:39.420
You, you want a normal life?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.463
- I have a normal life.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.966
- That's not what I
asked you, playboy.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.845
I said do you,
(ominous music building)

14:47.845 --> 14:49.805
you want a normal life?

14:52.474 --> 14:55.269
- I have a normal life, I
like it very much, thank you.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.648
- That's cute.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.150
Who the hell wants
a normal life?

15:03.694 --> 15:04.653
- Normal people?

15:06.488 --> 15:07.990
- (softly chuckling) Okay.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.868
Okay, now I get it, I get it.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.661
Yeah, I tried being normal once.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.997
It was the worst 30
seconds of my fucking life.

15:16.707 --> 15:20.002
Normal is for people
without courage.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.505
- I don't know, Dan.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.009
My dad used to say,

15:28.385 --> 15:31.513
"You become the price you
paid to get what you want."

15:31.513 --> 15:35.351
So, just make sure
you really want it.

15:35.351 --> 15:39.563
No matter what it is, even
if it's a normal life.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.860
- From the mouth of a babe.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.905
- I don't think
that's an expression.

15:47.905 --> 15:48.739
- Well, I'm saying-

15:48.739 --> 15:49.698
- For Dan, it is.

15:51.992 --> 15:55.996
(ominous music softly building)

16:01.377 --> 16:02.670
- Oh my god.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.504
- See?

16:05.923 --> 16:09.343
- Was it me, or was it 1000
times more obnoxious than usual?

16:09.343 --> 16:10.719
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.056
You weren't like that, right?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.060
- I suppose we all were.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.354
Even when we weren't, you know?

16:21.939 --> 16:22.773
- Yeah.

16:25.067 --> 16:25.901
I'm sorry.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.404
I know you guys
hadn't seen each other

16:28.404 --> 16:29.905
since the funeral
and everything,

16:29.905 --> 16:34.451
and I thought it might help
with your writer's block.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.205
- Maybe it would, you know?

16:40.124 --> 16:42.418
If I hit it to so much
Dan, it might, you know?

16:42.418 --> 16:45.546
It's just so much
Dan, but, it might.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.380
- Yeah.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.133
- No.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.801
- You're so much
better than him.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.391
I love you.
(soft piano music)

16:57.391 --> 16:58.267
Just two more days.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.564
- Just two more days.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.619
(soft blues jazz)

17:18.619 --> 17:21.290
- Rob has been asking
a lot about you lately.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.084
You know, just figuring
out (softly mumbles)

17:24.084 --> 17:26.295
- Thank-
- Hey, let's stop.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.421
Who's selling who
here, all right?

17:27.421 --> 17:29.298
I don't lose, all right?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.591
You're coming back
to work for me.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.844
That's it, it's a
done deal, all right?

17:33.844 --> 17:36.138
Winning and shaving, huh?

17:36.138 --> 17:37.306
Go hand in hand.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.641
You do it everyday,
or you look like shit.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.144
That's just, it's just the way.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.104
It's just the way
the world works, man.

17:45.647 --> 17:46.482
Gary knew it.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.484
Fucking Gary.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.486
Pauline said so.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.322
- You still talk to his wife?

17:55.949 --> 17:56.784
- Yeah.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.621
Gary.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.333
"How the heaven are you?"

18:04.333 --> 18:06.043
That's what Gary used
to say when he'd walk

18:06.043 --> 18:08.337
into a room, "How
the heaven are you?"

18:08.337 --> 18:12.174
Dumb fuckers say hell,
he thought it was corny.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.844
What I wouldn't give to like
hear it again, you know?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.350
(Dan softly humming in sleep)

18:21.350 --> 18:23.185
(dishes loudly clattering)

18:23.185 --> 18:26.522
(faucet loudly running)

18:29.525 --> 18:33.070
(cookware loudly clanging)

18:55.884 --> 18:59.054
(softly uttering gibberish)

18:59.054 --> 19:02.391
(softly drumming hands)

19:06.728 --> 19:09.064
(loudly drumming hands)

19:09.064 --> 19:12.234
(softly drumming hands)

19:12.234 --> 19:15.571
(loudly drumming hands)

19:24.580 --> 19:27.749
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.752
Hey, listen, Veronica, Veronica,

19:32.296 --> 19:34.882
she's a good girl, man,
you're lucky you found her.

19:36.133 --> 19:36.967
- I am.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.137
- Me too.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.471
- Whatever that means.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.641
- Hey, boop. (softly laughs)

19:44.641 --> 19:46.894
Hey, man, listen, seriously,

19:50.397 --> 19:52.441
you, you're a good friend.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.152
- Yeah, I love you too.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.905
- Hey, you're a good
friend, right, and,

19:59.448 --> 20:00.949
we're brothers, we're brothers.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.786
Sorry about your wife, man.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.997
(dramatic music pounding)

20:06.997 --> 20:09.291
(ominous music)

20:09.291 --> 20:10.751
- What'd you say?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.754
Dan, what'd you say, Dan?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.131
Dan! Dan?

20:16.131 --> 20:20.135
(ominous music loudly building)

20:40.781 --> 20:43.825
(soft ominous music)

20:53.210 --> 20:56.463
(haunting piano music)

21:19.695 --> 21:23.699
(ominous music loudly building)

21:43.385 --> 21:46.388
(soft ominous music)

21:48.765 --> 21:52.728
(dramatic music loudly pounds)

21:53.895 --> 21:57.107
- What you doing?
(ominous music)

21:57.107 --> 21:58.567
Come to bed, baby.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.712
(soft haunting piano music)

22:20.088 --> 22:20.922
- Vero?

22:23.717 --> 22:24.551
Vero?

22:26.762 --> 22:27.596
Vero?

22:43.904 --> 22:47.949
(dramatic music loudly pounding)

22:51.078 --> 22:52.454
(soft ominous music)

22:52.454 --> 22:53.789
- Did I wake you?

22:59.002 --> 23:01.797
It's been so long since
you've held me like that.

23:03.673 --> 23:04.466
I miss it.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.309
Are you feeling okay?

23:14.309 --> 23:15.143
- Yeah.

23:19.481 --> 23:23.985
- You're not letting what
he said get to you, are you?

23:23.985 --> 23:25.445
He's the kinda guy
who shits on you

23:25.445 --> 23:27.989
and says, "Lucky you," 'cause
he's got soap and water.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.492
You're great here.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.495
You're gonna get
the script done.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.331
Everything's gonna be fine.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.377
- Okay.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.462
Sure.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.839
- Just one more day.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.846
Now go take a shower, you
smell like pickled ass.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.685
- Thanks.

23:57.853 --> 24:02.149
(shower running
drowns out singing)

24:05.026 --> 24:07.737
♪ Don't walk away

24:07.737 --> 24:10.490
(softly humming)

24:15.579 --> 24:16.413
Oh, yeah.

24:20.041 --> 24:20.876
Vero?

24:22.502 --> 24:23.879
Vero, can you get me a towel?

24:30.385 --> 24:33.263
Our shower's acting up again.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.098
Vee, can I get a towel?

24:38.518 --> 24:41.730
(door loudly clatters)

24:43.523 --> 24:45.942
Oh! Sorry.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.737
- It's okay, do you
still need a towel?

24:49.613 --> 24:52.908
- Yeah, I didn't
know it was you.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.701
- How could you have?

25:11.927 --> 25:12.761
Morning.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.262
- Morning.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.722
Vero?

25:15.722 --> 25:17.766
Oh, she went to the
general store with Dan

25:17.766 --> 25:19.267
to get some eggs, I think.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.101
- Eggs?

25:21.937 --> 25:23.897
I coulda swore we picked
some eggs on the way up.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.440
- [Pia] Do you want some coffee?

25:25.440 --> 25:26.775
I just made a fresh pot.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.610
- Sure.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.281
How long did they leave?

25:33.281 --> 25:34.324
- A little while ago.

25:37.994 --> 25:38.912
- Here you go.

25:38.912 --> 25:39.663
- Thank you.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.302
- So, that movie idea,

25:55.428 --> 25:56.596
what is it about?

25:56.596 --> 25:57.430
- The what?

25:58.306 --> 25:59.349
Oh, the script, yeah.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.769
To make a long story less long,

26:02.769 --> 26:06.314
it's about a robbery and a love
story that comes out of it.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.025
- Between two of the hostages?

26:09.025 --> 26:12.195
- No, no, no, no, between the
robber and one of the hostages

26:12.195 --> 26:14.114
but I guess you can kind of
say that he's a hostage too

26:14.114 --> 26:17.993
because the robber's
holding them at gunpoint,

26:17.993 --> 26:21.496
and the cops are holding the
robber at gunpoint, so, yeah.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.499
Anyway, it just got
a bit too contrived.

26:24.499 --> 26:25.333
- [Pia] What?

26:25.333 --> 26:26.334
- The script.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.545
- No, what part got contrived?

26:28.545 --> 26:33.008
- Oh, the love story,
I guess, and the,

26:33.008 --> 26:34.342
the whole thing, really.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.386
But mainly the love story.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.184
Every time I tried it,
I just had to like-

26:43.184 --> 26:44.144
- Force it.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.520
- Yeah, yeah.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.355
- Well, you know what they say,

26:47.355 --> 26:49.357
love is like fart.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.526
If you have to force
it, it's probably shit.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.655
Life is very complicated.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.865
- Yeah.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.533
- Love shouldn't be.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.367
- No.

27:00.744 --> 27:04.539
- Okay, so we're
starting at the money,

27:04.539 --> 27:07.709
the woman, and getting away.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.044
What does he really want?

27:10.378 --> 27:11.921
- What do you mean?

27:11.921 --> 27:14.257
- Douglas, this is a love story.

27:14.257 --> 27:17.677
He can only have one
want, one want and what.

27:19.679 --> 27:23.058
- Well, no, no, he has to get
both the woman and the money.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.893
Otherwise it's not a
happy Hollywood ending.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.394
- Happy Hollywood ending depends

27:26.394 --> 27:29.022
where you stop the
story, Douglas.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.940
And the story only starts

27:30.940 --> 27:32.942
when you know what
he really wants.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.236
What he really wants
will drive the story.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.533
- Yeah, that's actually,

27:42.202 --> 27:44.079
that's really good
advice, I must say.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.081
- It must be, if you must say.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.459
Did you write yourself?

27:49.459 --> 27:52.712
- No, I just know what I want.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.798
- Hey, do you mind reading my,

27:54.798 --> 27:56.091
my script when I'm done?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.550
(door softly clatters) Okay.

28:03.098 --> 28:07.435
(Douglas softly whistling)

28:07.435 --> 28:11.398
(ominous music loudly building)

28:17.987 --> 28:19.614
- [Dan] Whoa! Whoa!

28:20.448 --> 28:23.618
(Dan softly laughing)

28:25.120 --> 28:27.789
- You're so strong,
oh my god, hey, hey.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.458
(dramatic pounding
drowns out Veronica)

28:30.458 --> 28:32.961
- Let me ask you, let me ask
you, are you a Kenny G fan?

28:32.961 --> 28:33.795
- Yes.

28:33.795 --> 28:34.629
- You like Kenny G?

28:34.629 --> 28:35.463
- I love Kenny G.

28:35.463 --> 28:36.297
- Are you serious?

28:36.297 --> 28:37.799
- [Veronica] Yes!

28:37.799 --> 28:40.343
- Oh my god, Douglas, you
sandbagging son of a bitch.

28:40.343 --> 28:41.845
You're holding out on me, huh?

28:41.845 --> 28:44.472
I see, you're trying to keep
all the good shit to yourself.

28:44.472 --> 28:48.768
You're amazing. (Veronica
loudly giggling)

28:48.768 --> 28:49.602
Oh my God.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.981
Your face right
now, it's like you,

28:54.274 --> 28:55.942
tickled his O-ring mid stroke.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.654
You okay?

29:02.699 --> 29:04.868
Okay, well this has
been a good talk.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.953
I will talk to you guys later.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.164
See ya.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.669
- Douglas, what was that?

29:22.677 --> 29:24.679
Is this about last night?

29:24.679 --> 29:28.516
(ominous music softly building)

29:28.516 --> 29:29.976
- I don't see any eggs, Vee.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.020
She said you're going to
the store to get some eggs.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.022
You guys having too
much fun to get eggs?

29:35.482 --> 29:36.691
- The store was closed,
the hours must've changed-

29:36.691 --> 29:38.693
- Must've, mm-hm.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.862
You know what, let's go down
there together right now,

29:40.862 --> 29:42.530
me and you, we'll see
if they have eggs.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.532
- Okay, maybe you need-
- I want eggs, I really want-

29:44.532 --> 29:46.034
- A little space or something-
- Some eggs right now.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.870
- To do whatever it is you
need to do to normalize but,

29:52.916 --> 29:54.542
I don't know what to say to you.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.024
(car softly honking)

30:18.024 --> 30:18.775
- [Douglas] Hey.

30:22.403 --> 30:23.238
- You startled me.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.697
- Oh, I'm sorry.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.534
I'm going to the general
store, do you want a ride?

30:27.534 --> 30:28.368
- [Pia] No.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.954
- Eggs.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.914
They didn't come
back with any eggs.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.415
So I'm gonna go get some eggs.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.126
If you...

30:41.756 --> 30:42.590
- Open.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.595
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:47.595 --> 30:48.596
- No.
- Shit,

30:48.596 --> 30:49.430
I'm sorry, yeah, perfect.

31:08.950 --> 31:11.119
I'm sorry, I'm just really
in my head right now.

31:15.331 --> 31:18.585
(radio softly clicks)
(soft moody guitar music)

31:18.585 --> 31:21.296
(radio softly clicks)

31:21.296 --> 31:24.132
- Learn to love the quiet.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.466
It has so much to show you.

31:32.098 --> 31:35.435
(birds softly chirping)

31:48.823 --> 31:51.659
Only keep the important one.

31:51.659 --> 31:52.493
Speak only good?

31:53.661 --> 31:55.288
- Speak no evil.

31:55.288 --> 31:56.039
- Sure.

31:57.165 --> 31:57.999
- They have a,

31:59.375 --> 32:02.670
there's a fair in the
square every fall.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.507
I won that the first time we
came up here, me and Veer.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.011
We used to come up here

32:11.512 --> 32:13.806
as a place to escape everything.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.310
Now it just seems like
we come up here to hide.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.814
But yeah, I guess I did, I
did keep the important one.

32:21.814 --> 32:22.690
Speak no evil.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.526
- Only good.

32:25.526 --> 32:28.029
- Only good, when I can.

32:31.032 --> 32:31.866
Let's go.

32:34.577 --> 32:37.497
(women softly chattering)
- There's no way, yeah.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.706
- [Woman] Yeah, and you
didn't know about it?

32:38.706 --> 32:39.540
- [2nd Woman] No.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.042
- [Woman] Oh, yeah.

32:41.042 --> 32:45.672
- [2nd Woman] My husband
(women softly chattering)

32:46.881 --> 32:48.341
- [Woman] Oh, I'm glad
he let you come here.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.927
- [Woman 2] Yes, yesterday
was beautiful anyway.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.053
- Aw, thank you.
- So I can't wait

32:52.053 --> 32:53.221
to see you again.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.055
- Oh, you too.
- Thank you so much.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.348
Nice to see you, bye.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.058
- Nice to see you too, bye.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.059
- Hi. Dee Dee.

32:58.059 --> 32:58.893
- Douglas.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.688
And friend?

33:01.688 --> 33:03.398
- This is Pia.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.899
Can I call you friend?

33:04.899 --> 33:06.401
- I don't know, can you?

33:07.735 --> 33:08.861
Pia.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.405
- Dee Dee.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.073
- Close friend, she and
her husband are her for,

33:12.073 --> 33:14.742
I don't know, just to get
away from the city for a bit.

33:14.742 --> 33:17.453
- Oh, how are you liking it?

33:17.453 --> 33:19.914
(speaking French)

33:19.914 --> 33:21.416
- Great.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.583
- That's French.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.544
- Oh, well, what can
I do for you two?

33:24.544 --> 33:27.422
- Just gonna get some supplies.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.257
Hey, Vero was here earlier,

33:29.257 --> 33:31.592
she said you guys
were closed, that,

33:31.592 --> 33:32.760
you change your store hours?

33:32.760 --> 33:34.137
- I was here a
couple minutes late,

33:34.137 --> 33:37.098
but the store has
the same hours.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.933
(soft ominous music)
- Okay.

33:41.728 --> 33:42.562
Okay.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.771
- Yeah.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.106
- We're just gonna
go get the shit

33:45.106 --> 33:46.607
that we're supposed to get.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.277
- All right, you go ahead, hon.

33:49.277 --> 33:52.947
(Pia speaks French)

33:52.947 --> 33:54.574
That's a nice shirt, I like it.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.784
- Thanks.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.787
(soft ominous music)

34:09.297 --> 34:10.965
Do you mind if I
stop for a second?

34:20.183 --> 34:23.018
(speaking French)

34:24.645 --> 34:29.108
- For me, it's wheat
bread, prosciutto,

34:30.275 --> 34:31.444
and a two-minute egg.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.656
(speaking French)

34:38.993 --> 34:40.995
I can live without
the prosciutto today.

34:43.164 --> 34:46.000
(speaking French)

34:51.380 --> 34:52.799
- How well do you know Dan?

34:56.969 --> 34:58.513
- How well should I?

34:58.513 --> 34:59.388
- You married him.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.517
You should know him the best.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.227
- Then that's how
much I know him.

35:05.353 --> 35:06.187
- Is that enough?

35:07.855 --> 35:09.232
- For me it is.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.032
The trouble you're feeling,

35:20.409 --> 35:21.369
is about Veronica?

35:24.330 --> 35:25.164
- Yeah.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.043
- Is it something she's done?

35:30.211 --> 35:31.879
Or something you
think she has done?

35:36.050 --> 35:37.385
- I don't know anymore.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.054
- When do you?

35:44.392 --> 35:46.561
Two things we should
never get angry with,

35:48.354 --> 35:52.733
things we can change, and
the things we cannot change.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.737
- That doesn't make any sense.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.740
(Pia softly laughs)

36:06.414 --> 36:10.251
- What if it wasn't us that
needs to know them well?

36:17.592 --> 36:19.260
- Oh, your egg, um-

36:19.260 --> 36:20.928
- Two-minute egg.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.597
- Not a word of this
to Veronica, okay?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.599
- Ooh, a secret.

36:26.726 --> 36:30.730
(ominous music loudly building)

37:00.927 --> 37:02.470
(music drowns out Dan)
- No.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.641
(Veronica softly giggles)

37:06.641 --> 37:07.850
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi.

37:09.810 --> 37:12.521
- Hey, babe.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.356
You good?

37:13.356 --> 37:14.482
- Yeah.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.817
(Douglas and Dan softly chuckle)

37:16.817 --> 37:18.527
- All right, come on.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.166
- I normalized, so, yay.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.506
- Okay.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.007
- Look, look, but I, look, I'm,

37:41.550 --> 37:42.385
I'm sorry, dammit, okay?

37:42.385 --> 37:43.803
I'm sorry.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.138
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

37:46.138 --> 37:48.849
I'm not the jealous
type, you know that.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.685
- "I, I, I."

37:51.852 --> 37:54.021
You really wanna
show me you care?

37:54.021 --> 37:55.856
Think about me first, for once.

37:59.694 --> 38:03.864
(ominous music
softly distorting)

38:20.214 --> 38:21.757
- All right, so I'm
thinking about brownies,

38:21.757 --> 38:23.050
you guys want some brownies?

38:23.050 --> 38:24.218
- Yeah.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.052
- [Dan] All right,
babe, you're gonna cook

38:25.052 --> 38:25.886
some brownies for us?

38:25.886 --> 38:27.179
- [Pia] Yeah, sure.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.389
- [Dan] Okay, come
on, get over here.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.682
She's hot, she's gonna
make some brownies.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.516
- I like this.

38:30.516 --> 38:31.350
- Oh, thank you.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.561
- "I, I, I."

38:33.561 --> 38:35.396
You really wanna
show me you care?

38:35.396 --> 38:37.898
Think about me first.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.233
- Danish?
- Danish, yeah.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.901
- She says danish,
I don't understand.

38:40.901 --> 38:44.238
Yeah, but it's good,
it's a one-day trip,

38:44.238 --> 38:47.575
wine-tasting, it's fun,
it's up in Santa Ynez.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.576
Babe, Santa Ynez?

38:48.576 --> 38:49.535
- I don't know, baby.

38:49.535 --> 38:50.786
- Spain.

38:50.786 --> 38:55.458
(ominous music building
and distorting)

39:21.233 --> 39:23.110
- [Veronica] "I, I, I."

39:23.110 --> 39:24.737
Think about me first.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.079
- I swear to god,
listen, listen, listen.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.288
So, you remember this?

39:34.288 --> 39:36.082
Gary comes and he kicks
open the goddam door,

39:36.082 --> 39:37.458
and he's holding
his cheeks together,

39:37.458 --> 39:38.793
he's like, "Where's the
shitter, where's the shitter?"

39:38.793 --> 39:39.668
He's gonna shit
all over himself,

39:39.668 --> 39:40.753
I promise you.
- No.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.592
- Stop the press.

39:46.592 --> 39:47.468
Holy shit.

39:48.844 --> 39:53.849
From a bearded clam to a
Brazilian-waxed beaver, whew!

39:55.309 --> 39:58.020
Your puss just keeps getting
prettier and prettier, baby.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.647
Come on in and sit
down, come on, come on,

39:59.647 --> 40:01.982
sit down, the new man, huh?

40:01.982 --> 40:05.528
I saved ya some, oh my
god, Hollywood, Hollywood!

40:07.154 --> 40:08.489
Hey, man, welcome back.

40:09.657 --> 40:13.494
You lookin' gorgeous,
Tom Cruise, I like it.

40:16.330 --> 40:17.832
You guys throw a great party.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.502
You must excuse me, I think
I've had too much of this.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.172
There he is, there he
is, Hollywood, Hollywood!

40:27.508 --> 40:29.301
Did I put it down or
did I put it down?

40:31.303 --> 40:32.179
- You put it down.

40:37.059 --> 40:38.394
What?

40:38.394 --> 40:39.687
- No, man, I love
you, I love ya.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.522
I'm gonna go take a piss.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.691
- Dan.
- Thanks.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.192
- What?
- TMI.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.695
- Listen, what I coulda said
is I'm gonna take a dump,

40:47.695 --> 40:49.363
but we just ate.
- Oh, wow.

40:49.363 --> 40:50.865
- I'm not gonna be weird.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.158
I'll be back, you guys.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.040
- [Veronica] Sorry, your lips,

41:01.542 --> 41:04.712
your lipstick, I'm
loving that shade.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.382
It seems hydrating but not wet,

41:08.382 --> 41:10.509
and your lips look so full.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.761
- It's not a lipstick,
it's a gloss.

41:12.761 --> 41:14.346
- Oh, what brand?
(phone softly vibrating)

41:14.346 --> 41:16.849
Oh, I'm sorry, I
have to take this.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.392
Hello, this is Veronica.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.398
- It is a lipstick, I think.

41:25.232 --> 41:26.859
- Really?

41:26.859 --> 41:28.569
- Now we have two secrets.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.284
- The owner put that chair there

42:17.284 --> 42:19.954
like six months ago, it's new.

42:19.954 --> 42:20.788
- Yeah?

42:23.415 --> 42:25.459
- Yeah, they made it to
look old, but it's new.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.806
- I like the, um-

42:38.806 --> 42:39.640
- Oh.

42:41.100 --> 42:41.934
Thanks.

42:43.852 --> 42:44.770
Been a long time.

42:47.648 --> 42:49.483
- Yeah?
- It feels good.

42:49.483 --> 42:50.317
- Great.

42:51.485 --> 42:53.153
- It looks better though, right?

42:56.865 --> 42:57.950
- Why'd you shave it?

43:09.837 --> 43:13.549
I never told Dan I didn't
like it, by the way.

43:15.175 --> 43:16.510
- No?
- No.

43:20.347 --> 43:21.181
It looks good.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.351
Not better, but good.

43:24.351 --> 43:26.687
(soft music)

43:38.240 --> 43:40.034
I think I should go.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.410
- But do you though?

43:41.410 --> 43:42.244
- Yeah.

43:52.212 --> 43:53.547
- Veronica.

43:53.547 --> 43:54.882
- [Dan] Veronica!

43:56.216 --> 43:59.219
Veronica, Veronica!

43:59.219 --> 44:02.056
- Here's the one I
was telling you about.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.223
- No, I couldn't.

44:03.223 --> 44:05.225
- Yes, you could,
and you should.

44:05.225 --> 44:07.061
It's gonna look
much better on you.

44:09.563 --> 44:11.065
- Yeah?

44:11.065 --> 44:15.527
- Yeah, your skin tone and
the warmth of it, definitely.

44:18.072 --> 44:19.073
- Okay.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.074
- Oh, may I?

44:27.289 --> 44:28.916
It's okay, it's okay.

44:31.585 --> 44:35.214
Perfect, come, I have so
much more to show you.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.432
- Thanks for getting Dan
to come up, by the way.

44:46.767 --> 44:47.935
I don't know if I said that

44:47.935 --> 44:50.104
with everything going
on, it's just...

44:51.605 --> 44:54.733
- He misses you guys,
even if he won't say so.

44:56.652 --> 44:57.611
I miss him too.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.155
And you.

45:03.617 --> 45:05.619
- How have things been
since the funeral?

45:07.121 --> 45:11.166
- Hard sometimes, he feels
guilty, like it's his fault.

45:16.964 --> 45:20.592
(Pia speaking foreign language)

45:20.592 --> 45:22.136
- What?

45:22.136 --> 45:24.638
- Beautiful, more
beautiful than when,

45:24.638 --> 45:27.349
when Lance tried to kill
you at the Hollywood sign.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.935
- Oh, on the show.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.773
That episode was over 10
years ago, so I doubt that...

45:40.487 --> 45:41.321
Oh my god.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.453
- Hey, I'm making mix.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.500
Dougie, hey!

45:53.500 --> 45:54.668
- What's that?

45:55.836 --> 45:57.045
- This is a, it's
called liquid courage.

45:57.045 --> 45:58.338
Little potion I'm making.

46:01.550 --> 46:02.384
You want?

46:03.343 --> 46:04.178
- Yeah.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.179
- Okay.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.181
You, you just go wait for me,

46:07.181 --> 46:08.724
I'll be out in a
second, all right?

46:11.185 --> 46:12.978
Yo, you think I'm
gonna roofie you?

46:14.146 --> 46:15.647
Listen, if I wanted to fuck you,

46:15.647 --> 46:17.149
I'd want you to
see it coming, man.

46:17.149 --> 46:20.861
Every inch, balls deep, leaving
my DNA all over your walls.

46:20.861 --> 46:23.030
Yeah, just go out, I'll
be out in a second.

46:44.051 --> 46:47.095
I call this A Goddam Shame.

46:47.095 --> 46:47.930
- Why?

46:49.389 --> 46:50.891
- I don't know, that's what
it's fucking called, man.

46:50.891 --> 46:55.229
Spiced rum, mezcal, spiced
Clamato, it's genius.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.569
Hey, what's the difference
between a baby and a trampoline?

47:04.905 --> 47:07.908
I take off my cleats to
jump on a trampoline.

47:07.908 --> 47:11.453
(Dan loudly laughs)
Come on, bro, come on.

47:11.453 --> 47:12.704
There was a time, man,

47:12.704 --> 47:14.373
you woulda pissed
yourself at that joke.

47:19.461 --> 47:21.755
So, what do you think about Rob?

47:21.755 --> 47:23.257
- Dan, I'm not going back.

47:23.257 --> 47:25.926
- I know, I know, I know, but
just, come on, just humor me.

47:29.429 --> 47:30.931
- Better than you.
(Dan loudly laughs)

47:30.931 --> 47:31.765
- He's better than me?

47:31.765 --> 47:33.267
Fuck you, man.

47:33.267 --> 47:35.269
The day I take shit from this
job's the day I walk away.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.229
But seriously, man,
like as a manager.

47:39.273 --> 47:40.899
- As a manager, he's adequate.

47:40.899 --> 47:42.609
He's a better salesman
than a manager.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.153
- I don't know,
it's kind of like

47:45.153 --> 47:47.155
that script you
wrote about us, bro.

47:47.155 --> 47:49.157
- Dan, I've already told
you, it wasn't about you.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.617
It was fiction.

47:50.617 --> 47:51.618
- Fiction my diction, man.

47:51.618 --> 47:52.953
- That's not even a sentence.

47:52.953 --> 47:55.122
- Anyways, look, it
doesn't matter, anyways.

47:55.122 --> 47:57.624
So hey, you remember, you
remember the circle, right?

47:57.624 --> 47:58.834
- Yeah.

47:58.834 --> 48:00.961
- Okay, so we're in the
circle and we're talking

48:00.961 --> 48:04.172
about this pipeline and this
guy and Rob starts Jonning on

48:04.172 --> 48:05.966
about a fucking
job he's working.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.467
- Get the fuck outta here.

48:07.467 --> 48:09.970
- No, I'm serious, and this
guy doesn't talk about shit

48:09.970 --> 48:12.806
unless he's closing a deal
and he knows he closed it.

48:12.806 --> 48:15.809
But there Rob was,
out of character,

48:17.269 --> 48:19.146
sweating like a blind bull
dyke in a fish market.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.816
Apparently the office
manager was a chink.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.985
- No, no, no.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

48:24.985 --> 48:28.655
And you know what they say,
chink's a jinx, Dougie.

48:28.655 --> 48:31.283
Those slanty-eyed,
abacus-loving fucks.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.160
They see right through
us, guys like you and me,

48:33.160 --> 48:34.161
see right through us.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.499
I'm talking about Rob,
never needed advice

48:39.499 --> 48:43.378
in the history of motherfucking
advice, until he did.

48:46.673 --> 48:47.674
Kinda like you, man.

48:49.635 --> 48:51.970
So I'm gonna tell
you what I told him.

48:57.309 --> 48:58.143
Bail.

48:59.978 --> 49:01.480
They can see you coming, buddy.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.191
Doesn't matter by
hook or by crook,

49:04.191 --> 49:06.360
you ain't gonna get what you
want, not the way you want it.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.528
(soft ominous music)

49:08.528 --> 49:12.032
Hey, what do you do when
I look you in the eyes

49:12.032 --> 49:15.160
and I tell you that
I can see you coming?

49:15.160 --> 49:18.872
(ominous music loudly building)

49:18.872 --> 49:20.374
(Dan loudly laughs)

49:20.374 --> 49:22.542
Your face right now, man.

49:22.542 --> 49:25.045
Like someone took
a shit in your hat.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.923
Oh anyways, the deal
Rob was working,

49:27.923 --> 49:29.549
he lost a shirt, we all did.

49:31.885 --> 49:32.719
But...

49:34.554 --> 49:37.933
Some fucking guy caught up
with him in the parking lot

49:37.933 --> 49:42.187
and he just beat the fuck out
of him, like fucked him up.

49:42.187 --> 49:43.730
His eyes hanging out
of his fucking head,

49:43.730 --> 49:46.608
his nose smashed in, man,
blood everywhere, fuck.

49:48.026 --> 49:48.860
Was crazy, man.

49:50.070 --> 49:51.863
But I guess, you know,

49:51.863 --> 49:54.574
that's the price you pay
for what you want, right?

49:54.574 --> 49:57.869
What did that douchebag,
Pakowski, say?

49:59.037 --> 50:01.123
"Find what you love
and let it kill you."

50:02.624 --> 50:06.753
Doug, whatever it is you're
chasing, I hope you love it.

50:06.753 --> 50:08.213
Cheers to you, motherfucker.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.136
It's A Goddam Shame.

50:28.442 --> 50:29.276
- May I?

50:43.790 --> 50:46.001
Do you like yourself,

50:46.001 --> 50:47.127
who you are today?

50:50.130 --> 50:51.506
- Kinda have to, wouldn't I?

50:53.800 --> 50:55.135
- I mean there's...

50:57.971 --> 50:59.806
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

51:02.642 --> 51:05.312
What if you spent
your entire life

51:05.312 --> 51:06.980
running away from who you were

51:08.815 --> 51:11.151
only to realize that you
were running towards it?

51:20.869 --> 51:23.497
- I'm not the same person I was.

51:23.497 --> 51:24.331
- No?

51:25.665 --> 51:28.710
(soft ominous music)

51:32.339 --> 51:34.674
So the truth is not
that Dan ate your lunch

51:34.674 --> 51:36.134
and now you want to eat me?

51:40.055 --> 51:43.683
He shoved his cock so
deep into her, you know?

51:44.851 --> 51:46.520
The surprise in her face.

51:47.854 --> 51:48.730
He loved it,

51:50.649 --> 51:54.986
watching her
discover every thick,

51:54.986 --> 51:57.864
veiny inch until
he exploded in her.

51:59.032 --> 52:00.325
And she came too.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.537
So many times.

52:05.038 --> 52:06.581
More than with anyone else.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.751
More than with you.

52:09.751 --> 52:12.212
(ominous music loudly building)

52:12.212 --> 52:13.255
She loved it.

52:15.048 --> 52:17.759
In fact, she liked
it so much that...

52:21.388 --> 52:24.015
She only thinks of him
when she's with you.

52:26.101 --> 52:30.605
And here you are, trying
so hard to make her come.

52:32.399 --> 52:36.236
But she only comes when she's
with you thinking of him.

52:36.236 --> 52:40.574
(ominous music
loudly intensifying)

52:48.915 --> 52:50.792
- What's going on?

52:53.920 --> 52:54.754
Dammit, Pia.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.595
Would it matter if I said
it doesn't mean anything?

53:04.764 --> 53:05.557
No?

53:07.434 --> 53:11.396
I mean, it's just, have you
seen the cock on that guy?

53:12.731 --> 53:15.609
(softly laughs) You
have, haven't you?

53:17.319 --> 53:18.153
Then you know

53:19.779 --> 53:20.780
after him,

53:22.324 --> 53:23.450
you're not enough.

53:31.791 --> 53:34.127
- The new you is the old you

53:35.670 --> 53:39.633
with a sensitive
stomach and no fangs.

53:39.633 --> 53:43.303
He can still bite if
you want to, I know it.

53:45.138 --> 53:46.681
Just fucking do it.

53:48.266 --> 53:49.100
Do it.

53:51.019 --> 53:51.853
Do it.

53:59.194 --> 54:02.864
(soft tranquil vocal music)

54:48.702 --> 54:53.373
(loudly descending
into haunting vocals)

55:07.887 --> 55:08.722
- Dan!

55:09.723 --> 55:10.724
You're so good!

55:10.724 --> 55:12.684
- Mwah! Wow.

55:12.684 --> 55:13.727
That's all it takes
to get your wife

55:13.727 --> 55:15.562
to scream my name, Dougie?

55:15.562 --> 55:17.188
I wish Pia were that easy.

55:17.188 --> 55:18.023
Babe, what?

55:22.944 --> 55:25.947
All right, well, I know this
is a dangerous proposition but,

55:27.240 --> 55:30.243
Dougie, do you wanna
chose the wine?

55:32.078 --> 55:33.872
- Sure.
- Okay, stop.

55:33.872 --> 55:35.081
I know what you're thinking.

55:35.081 --> 55:37.083
You're thinking
chicken, white wine,

55:37.083 --> 55:38.918
but that's poor
critical thinking.

55:39.961 --> 55:42.756
This is roasted
chicken, it's dark meat.

55:44.924 --> 55:47.594
So pairs red with the red.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.970
It pairs good with the red.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.434
Come on, chop, chop,
hurry up, buddy.

55:54.434 --> 55:55.268
- Okay.

55:56.269 --> 55:58.271
- Why don't you bring them both?

55:58.271 --> 55:59.647
- [Douglas] Okay.

56:00.815 --> 56:02.776
- So, we're going
to the canyons.

56:02.776 --> 56:03.943
- Pinot grigio, please.
- I think it'd be cool

56:03.943 --> 56:05.403
if you came with us.

56:05.403 --> 56:07.113
- I would love to go.

56:07.113 --> 56:09.616
- Oh, top me off,
buddy, thank you.

56:10.617 --> 56:12.452
- Babe.
- Thank you.

56:12.452 --> 56:13.995
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Sorry about that.

56:13.995 --> 56:15.955
- It's okay, it's okay.

56:16.998 --> 56:19.084
He was a dunce in class.

56:19.084 --> 56:23.630
So Dougie, what's this
strip you're writing?

56:23.630 --> 56:24.464
- Script.

56:24.464 --> 56:25.465
- Script?

56:25.465 --> 56:27.008
- You said strip, it's script.

56:27.008 --> 56:28.259
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

56:28.259 --> 56:29.928
- Well, you know
what I mean, right?

56:29.928 --> 56:34.307
All right, so Vero tells
me that it's about a heist.

56:34.307 --> 56:36.810
(Dan softly laughing)

56:36.810 --> 56:38.603
I thought you were supposed
to write what you know, man.

56:38.603 --> 56:40.647
What the fuck do you
know about a robbery?

56:42.982 --> 56:44.609
- I guess about the same as you.

56:47.695 --> 56:48.530
- There he is.

56:49.823 --> 56:51.449
Okay.

56:51.449 --> 56:52.283
All right, well,

56:54.869 --> 56:56.204
you know, it's funny 'cause

56:58.832 --> 57:01.334
Veronica tells me
that you're in a jam

57:01.334 --> 57:03.002
and you're stuck and
you can't get out of it.

57:03.002 --> 57:06.339
I just, you don't wanna flap
your gums about it, it's fine.

57:06.339 --> 57:10.009
I'm just, see what shakes
loose, just say so.

57:10.009 --> 57:10.802
- [Douglas] So.

57:13.179 --> 57:14.472
- [Pia] Dan, stop it now.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.058
- All right.
- Dan-

57:17.058 --> 57:18.351
- No, no, no, no.
(Pia whispering in French)

57:18.351 --> 57:20.311
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, this guy's

57:20.311 --> 57:21.396
rockin' is granny panties.
- He doesn't wanna

57:21.396 --> 57:22.355
talk about it.
- Listen, Doug knows,

57:22.355 --> 57:23.648
Dougie knows me.

57:24.732 --> 57:27.026
If he wants to tell
me to fuck off,

57:27.026 --> 57:28.319
just tell me to fuck off.

57:31.906 --> 57:33.491
- It's okay.

57:33.491 --> 57:35.243
I can, let him talk, Pia.

57:36.244 --> 57:39.706
So Dan, what is my jam?

57:39.706 --> 57:42.375
And how can I fix it?

57:44.878 --> 57:46.087
- Should I?
- Yeah.

57:48.882 --> 57:52.385
- Look, I'm just
here to help, buddy.

57:52.385 --> 57:54.053
If you don't wanna
talk, you don't talk,

57:54.053 --> 57:56.222
I just wanna help, right, Vero?

57:56.222 --> 57:57.724
- Yeah, he really does.

58:01.394 --> 58:03.396
- Dan wants to help me?

58:03.396 --> 58:05.106
Dan wants to help me?

58:06.232 --> 58:08.776
Dan wants to help me?

58:08.776 --> 58:10.028
(Douglas softly laughing)
- Yeah, I'm just,

58:10.028 --> 58:12.071
I'm just here to
help you out, buddy.

58:12.071 --> 58:15.408
(Douglas loudly cackling)

58:15.408 --> 58:17.118
- Dan wants to help me!

58:17.118 --> 58:18.286
That's so awesome.

58:18.286 --> 58:21.581
I love it, I love it, I love it.

58:22.874 --> 58:26.377
(Douglas loudly cackling)

58:29.714 --> 58:34.385
I'm so lucky. (softly mumbling)

58:34.385 --> 58:37.889
(Douglas loudly cackling)

58:48.983 --> 58:50.777
Dan wants to help me.

58:53.613 --> 58:55.782
Dan can't even help himself.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.784
- [Dan] Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.494
No, finish, Dan can't do what?

58:59.494 --> 59:00.328
- Help yourself.

59:00.328 --> 59:01.329
- [Dan] What can't I do?

59:11.589 --> 59:13.466
- The first thing they
teach you in Sales 101-

59:13.466 --> 59:14.467
- Yes, it's three yeses-

59:14.467 --> 59:16.094
- I'm fucking talking to you!

59:17.262 --> 59:18.304
- [Veronica] Douglas.

59:19.472 --> 59:21.099
- Sorry, yes, it's
the three yeses.

59:23.309 --> 59:25.770
The last thing they
teach to a fucking retard

59:27.146 --> 59:31.526
who doesn't grasp the basic
rudimentary, fundamental

59:32.485 --> 59:34.487
nuances of sales is, guess what,

59:34.487 --> 59:37.365
those same three goddam
yeses, and you know why?

59:37.365 --> 59:38.825
Because it doesn't
take intelligence.

59:38.825 --> 59:39.993
It doesn't take skills.

59:39.993 --> 59:43.162
It doesn't take creativity.

59:43.162 --> 59:46.291
It doesn't take a
fucking functional brain.

59:47.875 --> 59:51.838
All you have to do is
think of three things.

59:51.838 --> 59:53.840
Three, three little things

59:53.840 --> 59:58.136
that can make someone say yes.

59:58.136 --> 1:00:00.305
And you get them in the
habit of saying yes.

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:03.725
Like for example, is
Dan a fucking idiot?

1:00:03.725 --> 1:00:05.018
Yes.

1:00:05.018 --> 1:00:08.855
Is
Dan a
piece-of-shit-motherfucking-lowe

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:10.523
fucking-cocksucker liar?

1:00:10.523 --> 1:00:11.816
Yes.

1:00:11.816 --> 1:00:13.526
Is Dan the worst salesman

1:00:13.526 --> 1:00:16.529
in the history of
motherfucking history?

1:00:16.529 --> 1:00:17.697
Well, you guys probably
don't know the answer

1:00:17.697 --> 1:00:18.698
to this question but
I'm gonna lead you

1:00:18.698 --> 1:00:20.575
in the right direction, okay?

1:00:20.575 --> 1:00:23.369
Follow me, the
Wasserman account.

1:00:23.369 --> 1:00:24.704
I had that lead first, right?

1:00:24.704 --> 1:00:25.913
We can agree on that.

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:27.206
- That's right.
- I took a run at it

1:00:27.206 --> 1:00:29.375
and nothing clicked, so
then I left the company

1:00:29.375 --> 1:00:33.212
and did Rob give it to you, Dan?

1:00:33.212 --> 1:00:34.047
Fuck no.

1:00:35.506 --> 1:00:37.717
Rob wouldn't give you a fucking
lead with fucking shit, man.

1:00:37.717 --> 1:00:40.845
You fucking choke on fucking
water, you fucking simp!

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:45.058
(ominous music softly building)

1:00:45.058 --> 1:00:47.060
No, Rob gave it
to, remember Rubin?

1:00:48.227 --> 1:00:51.606
And then he gave it to,
I think it was Scott.

1:00:51.606 --> 1:00:53.733
And then every
motherfucking hand

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:56.903
in that motherfucking company
touched that motherfucker.

1:00:56.903 --> 1:00:59.238
So then, Rob give it to Dan.

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:02.742
What could go wrong?

1:01:02.742 --> 1:01:05.286
I mean, I've already, I don't
have any expectations here.

1:01:05.286 --> 1:01:06.913
So you got your
fucking hands on it.

1:01:06.913 --> 1:01:09.082
And you fucking hack.

1:01:10.249 --> 1:01:12.460
You took my shit,
my tools to get in

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:15.088
and you're luckier than a
fucking dog with two dicks.

1:01:15.088 --> 1:01:17.256
You're lucky because
Wasserman came in when he did.

1:01:18.257 --> 1:01:19.092
Look at me.

1:01:21.052 --> 1:01:22.261
You got shit on.

1:01:22.261 --> 1:01:23.763
That's all you did,
you got shit on,

1:01:23.763 --> 1:01:26.474
you got lucky and you
didn't fuck it up, Dan!

1:01:26.474 --> 1:01:28.434
Congratulations, Dan.

1:01:28.434 --> 1:01:29.936
That's, I think, the truth.

1:01:29.936 --> 1:01:32.647
If I'm not mistaken, we're
all friends here, so.

1:01:32.647 --> 1:01:33.773
- Yeah, I guess,

1:01:34.941 --> 1:01:36.109
I guess we are friends, yeah.
- Yeah,

1:01:36.109 --> 1:01:37.610
so is Dan the worst
fucking salesman

1:01:37.610 --> 1:01:40.113
in the history of fucking
salesman salesman sales,

1:01:40.113 --> 1:01:41.948
are you a bad fucking salesman?

1:01:41.948 --> 1:01:43.616
Yes, you are.

1:01:43.616 --> 1:01:46.452
I stomach you
because I like Pia.

1:01:46.452 --> 1:01:47.495
And for the life of
me, I can't figure out

1:01:47.495 --> 1:01:50.331
what the fuck she sees in you.

1:01:50.331 --> 1:01:51.165
Are you a hostage?

1:01:51.165 --> 1:01:52.792
Tell me right now.

1:01:52.792 --> 1:01:55.086
Blink twice for yes and once
for no, just fucking blink.

1:01:55.086 --> 1:01:59.298
I mean, literally, what do
you fucking see in this guy?

1:02:06.472 --> 1:02:07.932
Motherfucker said red.

1:02:14.814 --> 1:02:15.648
- I'm so sorry.

1:02:36.502 --> 1:02:38.838
- Well, you said it yourself.

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:40.882
He's 1000 times more obnoxious.

1:02:43.217 --> 1:02:45.136
- So he had it coming?

1:02:45.136 --> 1:02:47.638
You think what he
did makes you even?

1:02:47.638 --> 1:02:48.514
- Fuck even.

1:02:50.808 --> 1:02:52.018
Just one more day, right?

1:02:53.644 --> 1:02:54.896
- I know he can
be a lot sometimes

1:02:54.896 --> 1:02:55.855
but he's a good friend.

1:02:55.855 --> 1:02:56.981
- He is?

1:02:56.981 --> 1:02:58.357
A good friend?

1:03:00.985 --> 1:03:02.403
- He drove all the
way out here for you

1:03:02.403 --> 1:03:04.238
to be here for you,
can't you see that?

1:03:04.238 --> 1:03:06.073
- Drop the act, Vero.

1:03:07.408 --> 1:03:11.037
(soft haunting piano music)

1:03:12.663 --> 1:03:13.498
What's that?

1:03:16.375 --> 1:03:18.503
Why is the picture
under the dresser again?

1:03:21.214 --> 1:03:22.381
What the hell?

1:03:24.550 --> 1:03:26.719
I'm gonna take it that
wasn't lost, right?

1:03:28.679 --> 1:03:29.555
- No.

1:03:29.555 --> 1:03:31.849
- You wanna talk about it?

1:03:31.849 --> 1:03:32.683
- I don't.

1:03:35.269 --> 1:03:38.397
Normally, I'm an open
book, but I just,

1:03:38.397 --> 1:03:39.899
I can't do this right now.

1:03:39.899 --> 1:03:40.733
- Obviously not.

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:45.530
You know, but this is us.

1:03:48.574 --> 1:03:49.909
This is what we wanted.

1:03:52.912 --> 1:03:54.413
- It's the us you wanted.

1:03:57.250 --> 1:03:58.459
And there's nothing
wrong with that

1:03:58.459 --> 1:04:00.711
but have you ever really
looked at that picture?

1:04:02.255 --> 1:04:03.422
How happy do I look?

1:04:04.799 --> 1:04:07.718
Or do I look like someone
who's life is about to be over?

1:04:10.596 --> 1:04:14.100
Do you know what kind of jobs
aging soap actresses get?

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:17.103
Not the ones that are hot moms

1:04:17.103 --> 1:04:18.938
but the ones they just age?

1:04:21.607 --> 1:04:23.651
Trick question,
they don't get any.

1:04:24.569 --> 1:04:25.611
In that weekend,

1:04:26.988 --> 1:04:29.574
the network randomly decided
to make me the mother

1:04:29.574 --> 1:04:31.158
of a 16-year-old.

1:04:34.495 --> 1:04:35.329
- So?

1:04:36.789 --> 1:04:39.458
- I don't want to
be anyone's mother.

1:04:39.458 --> 1:04:41.460
I'm Kendall fucking James.

1:04:42.795 --> 1:04:43.963
- You're not.

1:04:45.172 --> 1:04:45.965
- I am.

1:04:46.966 --> 1:04:49.260
And overnight I'm 16 years older

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:52.013
with a life I never wanted.

1:04:53.139 --> 1:04:54.515
And you made me celebrate it.

1:05:02.648 --> 1:05:07.320
- When I look at that picture
I see the beginning of us.

1:05:10.114 --> 1:05:11.449
I don't see this.

1:05:12.825 --> 1:05:13.659
All this.

1:05:17.330 --> 1:05:18.664
That guy downstairs,

1:05:24.170 --> 1:05:25.004
I just...

1:05:29.216 --> 1:05:32.178
You didn't like what I did for
a living and I quit my job.

1:05:36.557 --> 1:05:40.519
You didn't like who
I was as a person.

1:05:40.519 --> 1:05:41.896
And I became this.

1:05:46.651 --> 1:05:48.861
You don't like the
way I make love.

1:05:57.703 --> 1:06:00.706
I'm not even in my
own skin anymore.

1:06:07.213 --> 1:06:09.048
Why aren't I enough?

1:06:09.048 --> 1:06:10.716
Why aren't I enough?

1:06:14.512 --> 1:06:16.347
- Because I want more.

1:06:22.228 --> 1:06:23.062
- Like Dan?

1:06:25.856 --> 1:06:26.691
- Yeah.

1:06:27.733 --> 1:06:28.567
Like Dan.

1:06:32.238 --> 1:06:35.032
I told you I didn't
wanna talk about this.

1:06:35.032 --> 1:06:38.202
(soft haunting music)

1:07:29.003 --> 1:07:30.129
- Sorry.

1:07:30.129 --> 1:07:31.297
- Oh, it's fine.

1:07:31.297 --> 1:07:32.506
- Didn't know you were
here, I would have-

1:07:32.506 --> 1:07:33.966
- You'd have stayed
in the bedroom?

1:07:33.966 --> 1:07:35.468
(both softly chuckle) Thirsty?

1:07:37.344 --> 1:07:41.182
(soft muffled jazz on stereo)

1:07:50.941 --> 1:07:55.154
- I read your
script a little bit.

1:07:55.154 --> 1:07:56.113
- Oh, yeah?

1:07:58.657 --> 1:07:59.825
What'd you think?

1:08:01.118 --> 1:08:02.495
- It's who you are today.

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:10.503
You weren't in the same when
you wrote the other one.

1:08:10.503 --> 1:08:11.879
It reads like it.

1:08:12.713 --> 1:08:14.799
- Is that good or bad?

1:08:14.799 --> 1:08:19.804
- It's honest.

1:08:21.013 --> 1:08:21.846
May I?

1:08:22.681 --> 1:08:23.724
- Oh, please.

1:08:32.233 --> 1:08:33.526
- Hmm, it's good.

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:35.693
- What, the script or the?

1:08:38.363 --> 1:08:41.325
- Okay, so, what
does Jacques want?

1:08:43.536 --> 1:08:46.496
The money, the girl,
or to get away?

1:08:49.041 --> 1:08:50.709
- Well, one doesn't work
without the other, so.

1:08:50.709 --> 1:08:52.545
- That's not true.

1:08:52.545 --> 1:08:55.214
If that's really what he wants,

1:08:55.214 --> 1:08:56.506
he's in a pickle.

1:08:57.591 --> 1:08:59.425
What, it's not
the way to say it?

1:08:59.425 --> 1:09:01.512
- No, it is, it's, go on.

1:09:01.512 --> 1:09:05.224
- Okay, so the
police surrounds him

1:09:06.517 --> 1:09:08.394
and he's got the money.

1:09:08.394 --> 1:09:10.728
But if he takes it,
he loses the girl

1:09:10.728 --> 1:09:13.232
because she doesn't
like stealing.

1:09:13.232 --> 1:09:16.568
But in your setup he needs
the money, always has.

1:09:16.568 --> 1:09:17.403
- Yes.

1:09:18.362 --> 1:09:21.407
- And there, the
girl comes along

1:09:21.407 --> 1:09:25.369
and he really wants
her bad, infatuation?

1:09:26.578 --> 1:09:28.539
- It's more than
infatuation, I think.

1:09:29.582 --> 1:09:32.585
- And the police threatens

1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:35.421
to take both possibilities away.

1:09:37.089 --> 1:09:39.758
- That's the gist, yeah.

1:09:39.758 --> 1:09:41.260
- Okay, so for me, it's clear.

1:09:42.928 --> 1:09:44.596
He needs to pick one.

1:09:46.389 --> 1:09:49.434
Stability, desire, or freedom.

1:09:51.937 --> 1:09:53.104
- How? You can't.

1:09:55.608 --> 1:09:57.610
- Why are you so
afraid to choose?

1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:05.409
It's only the choice he's
making him in that moment.

1:10:05.409 --> 1:10:07.286
Okay, let me help you choose.

1:10:07.286 --> 1:10:08.954
Let's try stability.

1:10:09.955 --> 1:10:10.831
- Why stability?

1:10:10.831 --> 1:10:12.458
- Because the cost of stability

1:10:12.458 --> 1:10:14.627
is diminished
opportunity to grow.

1:10:18.255 --> 1:10:19.089
- Says who?

1:10:20.174 --> 1:10:22.300
- Sheryl Sandberg, for one.

1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:23.469
- Who's Sheryl-

1:10:23.469 --> 1:10:25.930
- Just choose
opportunity to grow.

1:10:28.139 --> 1:10:31.018
- I'm just afraid I'm gonna
make the wrong choice.

1:10:31.018 --> 1:10:34.103
- There is no wrong
choice, if it's honest.

1:10:36.815 --> 1:10:38.651
(soft music)

1:12:49.156 --> 1:12:50.949
What are you doing, Douglas?

1:12:50.949 --> 1:12:52.242
- Making a choice.

1:12:52.242 --> 1:12:54.119
It's not wrong if
it's honest, right?

1:12:55.454 --> 1:12:56.789
You want this too, right?

1:12:59.291 --> 1:13:00.959
What just happened?

1:13:00.959 --> 1:13:02.628
- You are who you were today.

1:13:04.129 --> 1:13:06.090
- The same little guy with a,

1:13:06.090 --> 1:13:09.134
with a sensitive
stomach and dull fangs?

1:13:09.134 --> 1:13:10.928
- You said it, not me.

1:13:23.982 --> 1:13:27.653
(soft haunting piano music)

1:13:49.967 --> 1:13:54.012
(haunting music softly building)

1:14:24.543 --> 1:14:28.589
(soft dramatic orchestral music)

1:14:36.513 --> 1:14:39.850
(birds softly chirping)

1:15:10.088 --> 1:15:10.923
- You guys up?

1:15:12.132 --> 1:15:13.300
- He's still sleeping.

1:15:14.593 --> 1:15:16.594
- I'm gonna go for a run.

1:15:16.594 --> 1:15:17.888
You wanna join?

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:20.098
- God no, I don't run
unless I'm being chased.

1:15:21.892 --> 1:15:24.770
- I don't think he will
be up for breakfast.

1:15:24.770 --> 1:15:25.603
- Copy that.

1:15:59.471 --> 1:16:00.472
Surprised you're up.

1:16:01.306 --> 1:16:03.433
- Yeah, me too.

1:16:03.433 --> 1:16:04.934
Did you make coffee?

1:16:04.934 --> 1:16:05.769
- I did.

1:16:05.769 --> 1:16:07.145
- Oh, oh, you got it?

1:16:07.145 --> 1:16:08.605
- Yep.
- Thank you.

1:16:11.316 --> 1:16:12.317
- Hey, you seen Pia?

1:16:13.277 --> 1:16:14.318
- She went for a run.

1:16:17.823 --> 1:16:18.657
- Dougie?

1:16:19.657 --> 1:16:20.492
- No.

1:16:27.499 --> 1:16:29.334
- He came to bed last
night though, right?

1:16:35.674 --> 1:16:36.508
Hey,

1:16:38.135 --> 1:16:39.636
Are you guys okay?

1:16:41.847 --> 1:16:42.723
- Not sure.

1:16:51.398 --> 1:16:54.526
(soft ominous music)

1:17:27.434 --> 1:17:31.605
- Hey. (Douglas
loudly breathing)

1:17:33.106 --> 1:17:35.067
I've been coming up
here for all these years

1:17:36.401 --> 1:17:38.695
and I've never seen this
before, it's crazy, huh?

1:17:42.074 --> 1:17:45.744
I think I know how it
ends now, my story.

1:17:45.744 --> 1:17:46.870
- Yeah?

1:17:46.870 --> 1:17:47.746
- Yeah.
- You've written it?

1:17:47.746 --> 1:17:49.121
- No.

1:17:49.121 --> 1:17:51.083
- So how do you know?

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:53.418
Things don't always go
the way we want, Douglas.

1:17:54.585 --> 1:17:56.380
- Yeah, I'm picking
up this subtexty vibe

1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:57.755
that I'm hoping is
just that, a vibe.

1:17:57.755 --> 1:17:58.757
(Pia softly mumbles in French)

1:17:58.757 --> 1:17:59.925
Hey wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:17:59.925 --> 1:18:01.385
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait wait.

1:18:01.385 --> 1:18:03.053
I mean, can we both agree

1:18:03.053 --> 1:18:04.554
that I'm walking
off a cliff here?

1:18:04.554 --> 1:18:06.807
Like Wile E. Coyote and I'm
looking down at the same time?

1:18:06.807 --> 1:18:08.600
- No one asked you
to do that, Douglas.

1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:09.976
- He's, that advice!

1:18:09.976 --> 1:18:11.436
I mean, you came on...

1:18:12.437 --> 1:18:14.773
I'm sorry, I'm, I'm scared, Pia.

1:18:14.773 --> 1:18:17.317
Like I don't, I'm afraid
to do anything about this.

1:18:17.317 --> 1:18:19.778
About, about
anything in general.

1:18:19.778 --> 1:18:21.780
So I do nothing, I
don't do anything.

1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:23.907
I just, that's probably
why I don't do anything.

1:18:23.907 --> 1:18:26.493
I just, I just
don't do anything.

1:18:26.493 --> 1:18:29.663
You know, life has a way of
kicking your fucking teeth

1:18:29.663 --> 1:18:31.164
down your throat,
you know what I mean?

1:18:31.164 --> 1:18:32.916
You don't know which way
is up or down or sideways.

1:18:32.916 --> 1:18:34.126
So you don't do nothing.

1:18:34.126 --> 1:18:35.627
You just sit there,
you don't do nothing.

1:18:35.627 --> 1:18:37.462
You get to feel okay though,
that whatever life gives you,

1:18:37.462 --> 1:18:38.755
you just, you just accept it.

1:18:38.755 --> 1:18:41.091
I mean, I haven't been doing,

1:18:41.091 --> 1:18:42.300
haven't been doing,
I've been doing nothing

1:18:42.300 --> 1:18:45.137
since I left Barossa
since I met Veronica.

1:18:45.137 --> 1:18:46.138
But then you, you showed me.

1:18:46.138 --> 1:18:46.972
- I didn't.

1:18:46.972 --> 1:18:48.264
- You showed me.

1:18:48.264 --> 1:18:50.142
- It was about the
story, Douglas.

1:18:50.142 --> 1:18:51.268
- It was about me.

1:18:53.145 --> 1:18:55.188
The first time in a very,
very, very long time,

1:18:55.188 --> 1:18:57.357
I am going to take
control of my life

1:18:57.357 --> 1:18:58.358
and I'm gonna let,

1:18:59.651 --> 1:19:01.111
I'm gonna hold the reigns

1:19:01.111 --> 1:19:03.655
and I'm choosing
what happens to me.

1:19:03.655 --> 1:19:04.531
What happens next.

1:19:04.531 --> 1:19:05.657
- Yeah?

1:19:05.657 --> 1:19:08.618
So tell me, what happened next?

1:19:08.618 --> 1:19:11.329
- You, I don't care
about stability.

1:19:11.329 --> 1:19:12.956
I don't care if we
get away with it.

1:19:12.956 --> 1:19:16.001
Fuck Dan, fuck Veronica.

1:19:16.001 --> 1:19:17.460
Whatever happens happens.

1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:20.005
As long as you're
with me, I just,

1:19:20.005 --> 1:19:23.216
I don't care what happens next.

1:19:23.216 --> 1:19:24.050
I don't.

1:19:25.135 --> 1:19:26.178
You're my wanton want.

1:19:28.889 --> 1:19:30.807
- [Dan] Dougie!

1:19:30.807 --> 1:19:32.517
- [Veronica] Douglas!

1:19:33.894 --> 1:19:37.022
(soft ominous music)

1:19:41.193 --> 1:19:43.068
- Stop pursuing, Douglas.

1:19:43.068 --> 1:19:44.696
- Us, or this, or you?

1:19:44.696 --> 1:19:45.989
Don't you want this?

1:19:46.865 --> 1:19:48.532
Don't you want this?

1:19:52.662 --> 1:19:54.371
You know you want this.
(Pia speaking French)

1:19:54.371 --> 1:19:57.751
(ominous music building)

1:19:59.544 --> 1:20:00.378
(Pia softly screams)

1:20:00.378 --> 1:20:01.213
Shut up.

1:20:02.714 --> 1:20:05.884
(Pia loudly screaming)

1:20:10.055 --> 1:20:12.224
- What the fuck?

1:20:12.224 --> 1:20:14.184
- What the fuck?

1:20:14.184 --> 1:20:16.853
(Veronica loudly screams)

1:20:16.853 --> 1:20:19.231
- Fucker, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

1:20:21.441 --> 1:20:24.528
- You said you haven't
been coming, brother.

1:20:24.528 --> 1:20:25.695
And don't you dare fucking
look at me like that.

1:20:25.695 --> 1:20:27.030
You let that
fucking shit in you!

1:20:27.030 --> 1:20:28.907
Let him stick his shitty
fucking dick in you!

1:20:28.907 --> 1:20:31.201
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:20:31.201 --> 1:20:32.410
- He told me, he told me.

1:20:32.410 --> 1:20:35.705
He told me that when he
was on the couch, drunk.

1:20:35.705 --> 1:20:37.457
"I'm such a good
friend, Douglas.

1:20:37.457 --> 1:20:38.750
"I'm sorry for
fucking your wife,"

1:20:38.750 --> 1:20:39.584
like you're still
fucking Pauline.

1:20:39.584 --> 1:20:40.585
- What do you want, man?

1:20:40.585 --> 1:20:42.254
I'm not fucking your wife!

1:20:42.254 --> 1:20:44.255
- [Pia] But you're
still fucking Gary's?

1:20:45.924 --> 1:20:47.259
- Pia, Pia, Pia, wait-

1:20:47.259 --> 1:20:48.760
- Sorry.
- Pia, Pia?

1:20:51.888 --> 1:20:52.639
- It's true.

1:21:05.777 --> 1:21:08.737
- You are right, I
am not Kendall James,

1:21:10.448 --> 1:21:14.911
because this, all of this would
have never happened to her.

1:21:17.121 --> 1:21:18.331
I mean, if it did...

1:21:25.088 --> 1:21:26.298
- But Dan said that-

1:21:26.298 --> 1:21:28.967
- I don't give a
fuck what Dan said!

1:21:31.969 --> 1:21:33.471
I didn't deserve this!

1:21:34.472 --> 1:21:36.141
You are a fucking child!

1:21:45.859 --> 1:21:47.193
Was it worth it?

1:21:48.486 --> 1:21:49.321
All this?

1:21:51.323 --> 1:21:52.157
Look at me.

1:21:59.496 --> 1:22:00.874
Say it.

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:05.128
Say, "Yes, she was worth it."
- Absolutely.

1:22:05.128 --> 1:22:06.338
Every goddam second.

1:22:11.384 --> 1:22:12.218
- Thank you.

1:22:14.387 --> 1:22:15.722
I wish you the worst.

1:22:17.849 --> 1:22:19.351
The absolute worst.

1:22:24.648 --> 1:22:27.859
(car softly starting up)

1:22:27.859 --> 1:22:31.362
(car softly driving away)

1:22:45.710 --> 1:22:49.214
- It's just, okay,
what if I get to Lebec?

1:22:52.175 --> 1:22:53.343
How about to Grapevine?

1:22:55.053 --> 1:22:56.846
What if I make it
to Bakersfield?

1:22:56.846 --> 1:22:59.766
So if I get to Bakersfield,
you can get me?

1:22:59.766 --> 1:23:00.600
No?

1:23:01.851 --> 1:23:03.728
You know, there's a
bus in a couple days.

1:23:03.728 --> 1:23:07.065
Just forget about it and I
cannot thank you for this.

1:23:07.065 --> 1:23:08.858
All right, be well.

1:23:08.858 --> 1:23:12.404
(soft haunting piano music)

1:23:22.914 --> 1:23:24.416
Hey, it's me again.

1:23:24.416 --> 1:23:28.253
I'll just take the loan
ride, yeah, I'll pay for it.

1:23:28.253 --> 1:23:29.587
Okay, great, thanks.

1:23:31.255 --> 1:23:32.090
A minute?

1:23:34.425 --> 1:23:35.927
I'll be downstairs, okay, bye.

1:24:03.455 --> 1:24:05.623
- What's worse than a
pile of dead babies?

1:24:05.623 --> 1:24:09.085
The live one at the bottom
trying to eat its way out.

1:24:09.085 --> 1:24:11.463
(loudly cackling)

1:24:11.463 --> 1:24:13.505
How the heaven are you, Dougie?

1:24:15.133 --> 1:24:15.967
- I'm not Dougie.

1:24:17.802 --> 1:24:19.304
And you're not you.

1:24:20.972 --> 1:24:22.807
- And yet, here we are.

1:24:28.772 --> 1:24:30.273
- You're not real.

1:24:31.483 --> 1:24:34.110
- Come on, when has
that ever stopped us

1:24:34.110 --> 1:24:38.156
in this crazy
tapestry of, you know.

1:24:40.657 --> 1:24:45.038
Hey, where in Orion's
Belt did I have that last?

1:24:45.996 --> 1:24:47.999
- At the backroom, before you...

1:24:55.673 --> 1:24:58.175
(soft music)

1:25:04.557 --> 1:25:05.892
Why'd you do it?

1:25:10.730 --> 1:25:12.398
- Why does anybody do anything?

1:25:15.193 --> 1:25:16.361
'Cause it's time.

1:25:17.529 --> 1:25:18.862
'Cause it needs doing.

1:25:21.032 --> 1:25:23.368
When the show's over,
they turn on the lights.

1:25:26.037 --> 1:25:27.705
May I?

1:25:27.705 --> 1:25:28.540
- Yeah.

1:25:34.921 --> 1:25:36.214
- Just hang on.

1:25:37.507 --> 1:25:39.092
You're good, brother.

1:25:39.092 --> 1:25:42.053
(soft piano music)

1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:26.556
(soft uplifting piano music)

1:26:58.421 --> 1:27:01.966
(lightly knocking at door)

1:27:07.472 --> 1:27:08.306
- Pia.

1:27:17.148 --> 1:27:18.608
Pia, I'm so sorry-

1:27:18.608 --> 1:27:20.777
- Finish that sentence
and I'm out of here.

1:27:40.338 --> 1:27:41.172
- Did you like what I-

1:27:41.172 --> 1:27:42.005
- Did you care?

1:27:43.633 --> 1:27:45.802
- Of course I, yeah.

1:27:45.802 --> 1:27:46.636
No, I...

1:27:48.304 --> 1:27:51.014
- Dan has the same pitiful
look when he looks at me.

1:27:52.392 --> 1:27:55.228
The shame of knowing
that I know who you are.

1:27:56.688 --> 1:27:58.982
That makes my pussy
dry , Douglas.

1:28:05.530 --> 1:28:07.699
- I just wanna see
if you're real.

1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:09.826
- Am I?
- Yeah

1:28:14.163 --> 1:28:17.000
(speaking French)

1:28:32.889 --> 1:28:35.226
A sensitive stomach
and dull fangs?

1:28:37.228 --> 1:28:40.064
(speaking French)

1:29:01.627 --> 1:29:04.213
I can't fix the man
you've become, Douglas.

1:29:06.132 --> 1:29:07.258
Only you can.

1:29:10.261 --> 1:29:12.972
(speaking French)

1:29:15.725 --> 1:29:16.934
"I'm sorry, Pia."

1:29:18.770 --> 1:29:20.646
Yeah, you're sorry?

1:29:22.607 --> 1:29:25.443
(speaking French)

1:29:28.612 --> 1:29:30.948
You didn't happen
to me, Douglas.

1:29:32.742 --> 1:29:33.951
I happened to you.

1:29:34.952 --> 1:29:37.789
(speaking French)

1:29:46.422 --> 1:29:47.255
Yeah.

1:29:48.508 --> 1:29:50.968
Sensitive stomach
and dull fangs.

1:29:56.349 --> 1:29:59.477
(speaking in French)

1:30:18.204 --> 1:30:21.707
- I don't understand
a word you just said.

1:30:22.791 --> 1:30:25.294
- If you stop the story here,

1:30:25.294 --> 1:30:28.505
you have your happy
Hollywood ending, Douglas.

1:30:30.383 --> 1:30:32.844
