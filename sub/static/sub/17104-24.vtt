00:01.520 --> 00:03.159
Previously on Dance Academy...

00:03.160 --> 00:06.159
Abigail, you could learn something
by watching Tara.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.999
It was surprisingly good.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.639
Mum's trying to miss her plane.
Dad would freak if she did.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.599
You think?

00:13.600 --> 00:15.879
Mum moved us to Sydney
to be near you, and you never visit.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.719
I'm at the
National Academy of Dance.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.399
I have classes every day.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.799
I don't know if you know,
but my dad's a choreographer,

00:21.800 --> 00:23.359
which means that this whole thing,

00:23.360 --> 00:25.599
it's a lot more important
than just the marks, yeah?

00:25.600 --> 00:26.599
There's other pressures.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.199
As soon as this
room situation's cleaned up

00:28.200 --> 00:30.879
I'm gonna spend more time
with the boys, doing guy stuff.

00:30.880 --> 00:31.881
We're gonna jump.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.250
Arrgh!

00:37.840 --> 00:39.759
Thanks for everything.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.999
No-one's really tried
that hard for me before.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.719
Hey... Can we just stop
for a second?

00:45.720 --> 00:48.087
It doesn't feel... right.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.439
I have this recurring dream

01:40.440 --> 01:44.490
where I'm about to take
the biggest exam of my life.

01:45.840 --> 01:50.164
I open the booklet and realise
I can't answer a single question.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.207
All this time I've been
studying the wrong subject.

01:55.360 --> 02:00.360
It's like... I thought I was on track.
I thought I knew what I was doing.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.767
But actually, I...
I don't know anything at all.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.759
Christian's never gonna
speak to me again.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.250
Why?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.319
What are we...? What are we doing?
My shoes are melting.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.679
Look, if you can't keep up...

02:29.600 --> 02:34.242
- Hold this, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.010
Hoh!

02:46.400 --> 02:48.289
I did it!
Do it again.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.762
I am Hendrix!
You wish.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.159
Ah, bromance. Ain't it grand?

03:10.080 --> 03:13.159
Broken air-con
should mean no classes.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.731
It should mean wearing deodorant.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.839
You can't call a band 'Free Beer'.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.759
But imagine the poster.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.559
You're in a good mood... again.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.119
Yeah, we're getting a band together.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.799
Wait. You know that means playing
actual instruments, right?

03:27.800 --> 03:29.999
Auditions for the end-of-year production
are tomorrow.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.970
I'm teaching these
'Nutcracker' variations once.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.407
I have a headache. Pay attention.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.439
As first-years you can expect
to fill the corps de ballet.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.239
On rare occasions, we might decide
you're ready for a solo role.

03:46.240 --> 03:50.919
Katrina, even though your father
is directing 'The Nutcracker',

03:50.920 --> 03:53.439
it doesn't mean
you are guaranteed anything.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.680
Really? Promise?

04:05.360 --> 04:08.239
Katrina... seeing as you
missed that run-through,

04:08.240 --> 04:09.844
you can rehearse with the boys.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.239
And ready? And...

04:15.240 --> 04:18.639
Temps leve... glissade... cabriole.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.759
Miss Raine, there'll be a lot of
paperwork if I die of heat exhaustion.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.439
Katrina, we are all hot,
we are all uncomfortable,

04:24.440 --> 04:25.930
but we're here and we...

04:28.600 --> 04:30.999
Sorry about that.
Oh...

04:31.000 --> 04:34.079
Sweat! Gross!

04:38.440 --> 04:41.359
Use the resistance of the water.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.044
It'll help you
work the right muscles.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.730
Arabesque.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.323
Is this right, Patrick?

05:04.920 --> 05:07.810
Good, Tara. Rehab seems to have
strengthened your technique.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.010
Hey, Mum.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.605
Seriously?

05:27.560 --> 05:30.399
Do I have to?
I thought she had school.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.959
What?!

05:31.960 --> 05:34.599
I think Chris is getting us
some drinks or something.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.119
You two are very chummy these days.
Do I have cause for jealousy?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.839
Uh... maybe.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.679
We made a pact of brotherhood.
Oh.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.680
So... no more girls,
no more break-ups,

05:48.880 --> 05:52.959
no more jumping when one of you
snaps your pretty little fingers.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.759
From now on,
we are an Island of Men.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.959
Aww, you have a guyfriend,
just like you've always wanted.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.639
Yeah, I have a mate.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.959
It's just annoying that if anyone
in our year gets a solo,

06:06.960 --> 06:08.439
it's gonna be Abigail.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.119
Oh, my mum played Clara
when she was in first year.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.799
I'd love to play Clara.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.719
Yep, and she never got over it.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.559
Insisted on dancing it
until she was 30.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.039
I hate 'The Nutcracker'.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.279
I'd be Flower Number Six
if they wanted me to.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.759
I'm just happy I can audition.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.519
So how's your knee? Is it alright?

06:25.520 --> 06:27.170
Yeah, it's alright.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.684
Gonna chuck us
one of those drinks, bro?

06:37.880 --> 06:41.279
How could she do this to me?
She knows auditions are tomorrow.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.119
Where's Sammy?

06:43.120 --> 06:46.359
He's busy. We all are. Sit down.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.079
But we will see him tonight.
No, we won't.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.079
Why?

06:50.080 --> 06:51.999
Because.
Because why?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.159
Because we broke up.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.319
What did you do?
Excuse me?

06:57.320 --> 06:59.079
I'm not discussing this with you.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.039
It's so unfair.
Everyone's breaking up.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.159
Everyone in the whole wide world.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.079
Mum and Dad are.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.759
Paige, that's not funny.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.969
They are, and it's all your fault.

07:16.760 --> 07:21.119
What went through my parents' minds
when they made me do flute lessons?

07:23.200 --> 07:25.599
How is that a life skill?
You could play bass.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.479
Girls dig bass.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.559
Not that that's a concern, right?

07:29.560 --> 07:33.799
Island of Men. Sorry.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.479
Hey, this summer you should
come stay at my place.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.519
We can rehearse in the garage.

07:42.520 --> 07:46.479
Yeah, I could...
I could teach you to surf.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.639
Sweet. Yeah, awesome.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.479
You think your parents
would really go for it?

07:50.480 --> 07:53.359
I mean, this place gets a bit much
over the holidays.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.319
I think they don't have a choice.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.879
Look, you're still 'golden boy',
I am still 'child of concern'.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.089
That's not gonna change.
Yeah, we'll see.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.759
Uh-huh. Yeah.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.639
Yeah. Yeah. Ciao. Gattino...

08:19.640 --> 08:21.130
Papa.

08:23.240 --> 08:28.240
Ahh. Mwah. Mwah. No wonder
the company wanted to keep you, huh?

08:29.040 --> 08:31.119
You've been working out.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.239
A bit.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.879
And now it's all for nothing.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.280
We'll get to that.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.839
Um, so maybe you could take a look
at my reel at some point.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.958
Course. You're one of my
main reasons for being here.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.439
Oh, the thought of directing

08:45.440 --> 08:47.599
a student version of 'The Nutcracker'
wasn't temptation enough?

08:47.600 --> 08:50.279
The thought of keeping an eye
on you two was certainly appealing.

08:50.280 --> 08:55.002
There are some serious
family discussions to be had.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.959
How many more ways can he say,
"I'm disappointed?"

08:59.960 --> 09:03.159
Oh, well, welcome to my existence.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.799
You must have misunderstood.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.279
They fight on the phone

09:06.280 --> 09:08.839
and Dad hasn't been down
to visit us for ages.

09:08.840 --> 09:13.840
Paige, that's not the same thing
as breaking up.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.122
Push.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.643
Harder.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.839
Ouch! Careful!
All you care about is ballet.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.399
What do you want me to do, Paige?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.639
Lock them up in a room
and not let them out

09:30.640 --> 09:32.119
until they promise
to stay together?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.199
No, Abigail. I want you to help.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.359
I have to live there and you don't
do anything except make it worse.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.479
Meaning?

09:38.480 --> 09:40.079
I'm not the reason
Mum moved down here.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.919
Dad's back home and he needs us...
I didn't ask anyone to do that.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.605
Abigail, you HAVE to talk to them.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.599
No, I HAVE to rehearse.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.439
If they're splitting up
because of me,

09:52.440 --> 09:54.727
may as well make it worthwhile.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.610
Play.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.079
The girl?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.039
Tara Webster. First year.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.839
That's my best friend, Dad.
His muse, but my best friend.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.279
And you've sent this
to companies overseas

10:21.280 --> 10:22.759
looking for choreography work?

10:22.760 --> 10:24.919
Yeah, I've been getting
some positive responses.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.399
I'm not surprised.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.719
Your name alone would get you
in through the front door.

10:29.720 --> 10:34.089
But the work here...
doesn't stand up.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.759
Right, well, I'm approaching some
pretty cutting-edge places, Dad.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.728
Your name wouldn't necessarily
help me there these days.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.519
Maybe it's not
the right time for this.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.999
I'm peckish, you're jet-lagged.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.319
You should've taken
the company's offer.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.279
It would be years standing around
in a corps doing other people's work

10:53.280 --> 10:54.759
when I'm ready to do my own.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.399
Look! A pirouette!
You guys love pirouettes!

10:56.400 --> 10:58.639
At 18, you think you're ready
to stand in front of

10:58.640 --> 11:01.319
a group of professional dancers
and tell them what to do?

11:01.320 --> 11:02.799
I said no to the company, Dad,

11:02.800 --> 11:04.839
so if you haven't
got anything else to add...

11:04.840 --> 11:06.569
Well, here's a proposition.

11:08.840 --> 11:13.840
Don't audition for 'The Nutcracker'.
Come and work as my assistant.

11:14.080 --> 11:18.369
See if you can cut it
in a professional environment.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.644
You know what?
I think it's too hot to eat.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.519
Before I got to the Academy,
I had this list of 'Whys?'

11:28.520 --> 11:31.319
"Why do I get anxious if I don't know
where the nearest toilet is?"

11:31.320 --> 11:36.239
"Why do I have three hairs on
my chest and 18 on my big toe?"

11:36.240 --> 11:39.599
"Why do I like taking those IQ tests
on the Internet?"

11:39.600 --> 11:43.321
"Why have I never been this happy?"

11:45.280 --> 11:47.079
Great shot.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.959
Your break.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.839
Nuh. No way. I am hopeless.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.359
I thought... Oh, sorry,
I thought we were playing.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.999
Yeah, but Training Bra here
needs a lesson.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.479
Yeah.
OK, uh, what do I do?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.479
Alright, hit the white ball.
Try and get it in...

12:02.480 --> 12:04.879
Yeah, I'm done anyway,
so I'll just leave you guys to it.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.039
Yeah.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.079
There you go.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.162
So they don't know you know?

12:12.720 --> 12:15.079
But you could come home
and talk to them about it.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.239
Tell them how we feel.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.079
Hey, Mum.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.919
Yep. We're out the front.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.570
Paige is ready.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.839
Well, they said they're not
giving solos to first-years

12:33.840 --> 12:36.119
but I'm doing everything I can
to change that.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.919
Yeah. I know.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.606
Well, it's not like the competition
stands a chance. OK.

12:48.840 --> 12:52.159
Can I sit, or will that be
breaking the rules of brotherhood?

12:52.160 --> 12:56.563
Already broken.
He's in there with Tara.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.159
You know,
if they get back together,

13:01.160 --> 13:03.239
we are entitled
to lodge an objection.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.403
How many times can they
put us through that?

13:08.640 --> 13:12.119
So... you and Christian have been
hanging out a lot lately.

13:12.120 --> 13:17.120
It'd be totally understandable
if you'd developed, say... a crush.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.239
On who? Tara?

13:20.240 --> 13:24.279
Christian.
Like... a man-crush, or whatever.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.519
I don't have a crush
on Christian, Kat.

13:27.520 --> 13:31.599
Hey, I've had girl-crushes before.
It doesn't have to mean anything.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.679
Come on.
You are an evolved specimen, Samuel.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.365
We can talk about this.
Can we change the subject?

14:54.240 --> 14:56.079
OK, so, I have a couple
of casting suggestions

14:56.080 --> 14:58.719
that I wanna run past you
and a few staging ideas as well.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.119
I think there are some pretty exciting
places we can take this.

15:01.120 --> 15:04.488
Great. I need you
to photocopy these schedules.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.039
Now would be a good time, Ethan.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.646
Um... sure.

15:13.320 --> 15:18.320
So... 'Nutcracker'.
Are you ready to fight the mice?

15:18.440 --> 15:21.359
Dad, really, do you have to?

15:21.360 --> 15:22.879
I'll never forget it, that's all.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.919
Your mother was playing Clara,
it was a battle scene, you were...

15:26.920 --> 15:29.359
Three, and I ran onstage
to save her.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.399
You stopped the whole performance.
You stole the show.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.999
And I knew right there and then

15:33.000 --> 15:35.002
that you were born to be
on the stage too.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.039
See, that's why I'm not worried
about you. I get it.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.759
You felt the need to
push the boundaries this year,

15:41.760 --> 15:45.079
but I know that next year
you'll be ready to work.

15:45.080 --> 15:49.210
I've been pushing the boundaries
because I've been unhappy here, Dad.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.799
Then why haven't you left?

15:52.800 --> 15:55.479
Wasn't aware that
I actually had a choice.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.719
Oh, come on, kitten, ever since
you've been three years old

15:57.720 --> 15:59.599
you've done whatever you wanted to.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.839
I get that you wanna rebel against your
parents, but you belong here.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.888
The sooner you start accepting that,
the better.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.159
I am not one of your teachers.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.999
I'm not interested in
school politics, what year you're in,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.679
or your attendances.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.879
I am a choreographer.
I am looking for dancers.

16:28.880 --> 16:33.602
All that matters is how well
you perform, and how...

16:34.600 --> 16:36.479
how focused you are...

16:36.480 --> 16:39.039
So incredibly sorry.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.199
And how professional
you prove to be.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.879
Let's get started, shall we?

17:52.360 --> 17:53.361
You OK, Tara?

17:54.920 --> 17:58.159
Um... yeah. I'm fine. My knee's fine.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.639
Can you go on?

17:59.640 --> 18:01.439
You bet.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.601
From the manèges?

18:27.120 --> 18:30.759
- Great. So...
- I reckon. It'd be really good.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.559
Your cue, Kat.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.164
Uh... sorry.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.199
Are you OK?

19:46.200 --> 19:49.399
Yeah, I think so.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.971
Everyone...

19:53.160 --> 19:55.119
Dad...

20:03.640 --> 20:05.679
Hey! How did you go?

20:05.680 --> 20:08.081
How do you think?

20:18.640 --> 20:21.399
So?
Killed it.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.279
OK, this is bad.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.479
It's like I'm back in the exam room

20:28.480 --> 20:30.159
and suddenly I don't know anything.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.519
There's a whole list of 'Whys?'

20:32.520 --> 20:35.159
that have never even
crossed my mind before.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.959
You OK?

20:36.960 --> 20:39.559
Yeah.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.919
They're now staring me in the face.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.559
Some of us are about to head
to the pool. You gonna come?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.210
Yes. Yeah.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.959
The problem is,
once I let these questions out,

20:54.960 --> 20:57.199
there's no going back.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.559
I was just standing there
and I was really thinking,

21:00.560 --> 21:03.279
"Any moment now
I am going to dance,"

21:03.280 --> 21:05.759
and then suddenly my legs
were walking me out of the studio.

21:05.760 --> 21:10.239
Like I had absolutely no control over
what my body was doing...

21:38.920 --> 21:40.959
Christian's never gonna
speak to me again.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.399
Why?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.919
Because you were right.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.199
Sammy, a man-crush
isn't the end of the world.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.964
What if it's more than that?

21:58.440 --> 22:01.799
Mum... I got the Snowflake solo.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.600
I know.
It's so technically demanding.

22:08.200 --> 22:12.399
Hey, listen... do you think
I could come over tonight?

22:12.400 --> 22:15.290
Paige and I really need to
talk to you about something.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.999
It's not like what I had
with Abigail was nothing, OK?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.959
That was real.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.928
Yeah, of course.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.359
Things have just been so intense
since the court sentencing.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.959
Yep. Sure.

22:28.960 --> 22:33.039
And when you're living with someone,
in that close proximity,

22:33.040 --> 22:36.919
it's textbook that stuff
gets... confused, you know?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.968
Uh-huh. Yes, yes. All of that too.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.439
And maybe you just like him, Sammy.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.559
Audition walkout?
How could you not tell me?

22:46.560 --> 22:49.959
Um... it wasn't really planned.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.119
You OK?

22:51.120 --> 22:52.929
Mm. So far.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.639
I am the Mouse King.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.119
Mate, that's awesome.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.487
Cast list. Check yours.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.519
Soldier Number Two
and... Boy at the Party.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.603
Oh, yay!
What about you?

23:12.920 --> 23:14.919
Bah-bow.

23:14.920 --> 23:15.999
What?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.359
Nothing?

23:17.360 --> 23:19.879
I was late, I fell,
I just wasn't good enough.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.884
Hey, can I grab you for a sec?

23:28.200 --> 23:30.521
Look, you don't have to explain.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.719
We can't say anything until
the doctor signs off on your knee,

23:35.720 --> 23:38.326
so this has to stay
inside the vault.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.359
You're dancing Clara.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.999
What?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.685
Hope you're ready
for your life to change.
