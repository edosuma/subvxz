25:23.529 --> 25:24.698
Are you open to that?

25:27.242 --> 25:28.452
Claire?

25:29.577 --> 25:30.745
I'll fly out in the morning.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.664
No, no. You can come in the afternoon.

25:32.747 --> 25:35.583
You don't have to do any
events or press, just...

25:35.667 --> 25:38.337
be there with me when I make my speech.

25:39.254 --> 25:41.923
- I said yes.
- Thank you.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.300
Of course.

25:44.634 --> 25:46.345
Last night...

25:48.222 --> 25:50.640
Let's not. I'll see you tomorrow.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.644
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.706
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

26:17.292 --> 26:19.127
I wish I could take it back.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.586
I told you to be quiet.

26:26.343 --> 26:27.886
I thought I killed you.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.434
When I heard on the news you were alive,
I felt so relieved.

26:33.517 --> 26:35.852
- I doubt that.
- I mean it.

26:40.648 --> 26:43.360
I would pray for you.

26:43.444 --> 26:45.946
Probably sounds strange, but it's true.

26:46.654 --> 26:49.533
I would, because I felt so bad.
You didn't deserve what I did.

26:49.615 --> 26:52.119
None of this is going to change anything.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.919
Where are we going?

27:01.753 --> 27:03.171
Doesn't matter.

27:05.549 --> 27:07.675
Is it gonna be a while?
'Cause I have to pee.

27:11.346 --> 27:13.014
You can pee back there.

27:15.517 --> 27:17.102
You don't want that. The smell.

27:17.185 --> 27:19.187
It's either that or you hold it.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.607
- It hurts.
- Too bad.

27:23.317 --> 27:25.068
All right then, I'm gonna do it.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.228
Mrs. Underwood.

28:01.687 --> 28:03.106
Please, come sit.

28:14.117 --> 28:15.619
Thank you for coming.

28:15.701 --> 28:19.873
I'm sorry for how everything
has worked out. It's unfortunate.

28:19.956 --> 28:23.251
I'm sure it's been difficult for you,
with all of the effort you put in.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.379
Is this how it works?

28:25.462 --> 28:27.713
He nixes the book, you soften the blow?

28:27.797 --> 28:29.132
No, Tom, it's not that.

28:29.216 --> 28:31.176
Francis doesn't even know
I asked you here.

28:31.259 --> 28:33.220
Why did you ask me?

28:33.303 --> 28:39.893
Because I was wondering if...
we could talk honestly to each other.

28:39.976 --> 28:41.186
If you'd be open to that.

28:41.269 --> 28:44.648
- About what?
- New Hampshire.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.526
Did you let me pass out that day
on purpose?

28:47.609 --> 28:48.943
When I was giving blood.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.905
I let you keep talking.
I didn't know you'd pass out.

28:51.988 --> 28:53.240
And you didn't see it coming?

28:53.323 --> 28:55.659
You had things you wanted to say.

28:58.203 --> 29:02.583
And what did I say...
before I blacked out?

29:02.666 --> 29:05.544
Was there anything else
other than what you wrote?

29:05.627 --> 29:07.713
You don't remember?

29:08.630 --> 29:11.049
Some. But not all of it.

29:13.927 --> 29:17.347
I'm asking for me.
Because I need to know.

29:19.307 --> 29:21.976
Hatred.

29:22.060 --> 29:25.689
For how much you and Frank
needed each other.

29:26.898 --> 29:28.816
I used that word? Hate?

29:30.235 --> 29:31.486
You did.

29:33.572 --> 29:36.324
And of all the moments...

29:36.408 --> 29:39.077
that you spent
with Francis and myself, you...

29:40.370 --> 29:42.330
You believe that we're equals?

29:42.414 --> 29:46.042
I got fired, Mrs. Underwood.
I'm not on the clock anymore.

29:46.126 --> 29:50.004
There's a lot more to Francis and me
than what you wrote.

29:50.088 --> 29:53.925
Maybe so,
but I never got a chance to ask.

29:54.008 --> 29:56.219
Then ask. Whatever you want.

29:59.347 --> 30:02.350
Why aren't you with him? In Iowa?

30:06.020 --> 30:09.483
- I'm heading there tomorrow.
- Hm... [chuckles softly]

30:09.566 --> 30:10.609
You see?

30:10.692 --> 30:14.446
I ask a question,
and neither of you answer them.

30:16.072 --> 30:21.244
It's tiresome, constantly swinging
a sledgehammer at the faÃ§ade,

30:21.328 --> 30:23.789
just to get a glimpse through the cracks.

30:27.542 --> 30:28.794
Tell me what you see.

30:31.505 --> 30:33.548
Somebody who's lost.

30:35.801 --> 30:38.178
But I don't know.

30:38.261 --> 30:40.388
Maybe it's all for the best.

30:41.181 --> 30:45.686
I'd rather imagine who you might be
than who you actually are.

30:55.362 --> 30:57.238
Good luck, Claire.

You're gonna be able

What's the point?

32:32.292 --> 32:34.711
I can't hurt you.

32:34.795 --> 32:36.755
No one's ever gonna find me
or know who I am.

32:36.838 --> 32:38.172
I'm never gonna say anything.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.633
Quiet.

32:41.885 --> 32:44.345
If it's about punishing me,
you don't have to.

32:46.013 --> 32:49.726
This last year, some of the things I've
had to do, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

32:49.810 --> 32:51.770
I said quiet.

[horns honking]

33:57.627 --> 33:59.420
What did the overnight internals say?

33:59.504 --> 34:01.756
Still a toss-up.
Less than half a point gap.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.508
- Her or me?
- Doesn't matter.

34:03.591 --> 34:05.927
The margin of error is four-point-five.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.847
The last few days, the lead's
gone back and forth three times.

34:08.929 --> 34:10.389
Bottom line is turnout.

34:10.473 --> 34:12.516
- Sir?
- Yes, I'm almost ready.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.143
May I speak to you
for a moment privately?

34:14.226 --> 34:17.103
- Yes. Thank you.
- I'll be right outside.

34:18.398 --> 34:20.984
I just got word that Mrs. Underwood
has postponed her flight here.

34:21.067 --> 34:23.110
- What? Why?
- I don't know, sir.

34:23.194 --> 34:26.239
Also, Agent Swift,
the head of her detail...

34:26.322 --> 34:29.158
he said Tom Yates
came to the residence last night.

34:30.952 --> 34:32.579
Tell Vaughn I'll be down in a few minutes.

34:32.661 --> 34:34.371
Yes, sir.

34:34.455 --> 34:36.833
This is Claire.
Please leave a message.

34:36.917 --> 34:38.167
[sighs]

34:43.130 --> 34:45.382
This is Claire.
Please leave a message.

34:45.466 --> 34:48.553
It's me. When you get this message,
will you please call me?

35:36.768 --> 35:40.563
Listen, if you breathe deeply,

35:40.647 --> 35:42.189
you're gonna pass out right away.

35:42.273 --> 35:43.733
- Please.
- Then nothing's gonna hurt.

35:43.817 --> 35:45.860
Doug, please. Please.

35:47.194 --> 35:48.237
Help!

35:48.321 --> 35:50.740
No one can hear you.
Lie down, Rachel.

35:50.824 --> 35:53.534
Look, Rachel's gone!

36:00.207 --> 36:01.709
That is who I am now.

36:03.294 --> 36:06.089
Look, I know you
don't want to do this.

36:06.172 --> 36:08.091
[panting] You-- You could--

36:08.174 --> 36:10.426
You could've done it
in the parking lot last night,

36:10.510 --> 36:12.846
but you didn't, you kept me alive!

36:15.264 --> 36:17.433
I know this isn't who you are.

36:19.019 --> 36:20.103
Please.

36:20.186 --> 36:22.647
Please. Please. Please, just let me go.

36:22.730 --> 36:24.565
Please.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.234
Doug.

36:27.318 --> 36:29.737
Doug, please. Please.
Please just let me go.

- Fuck!

[man] The president is
on the line for you again.

37:04.939 --> 37:06.900
You told him I'm not feeling well?

37:06.983 --> 37:10.862
Yes, ma'am.
He'd still like to speak with you.

37:10.945 --> 37:12.572
Tell him I'm sleeping.

37:16.826 --> 37:18.619
I'm sleeping. Please tell him.

37:18.703 --> 37:20.205
Yes, ma'am.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.143
[door opens]

37:56.032 --> 37:58.034
[rustling]

38:06.626 --> 38:07.961
Here.

38:32.777 --> 38:35.113
I don't know why
you had to run that night.

38:37.073 --> 38:39.617
All I ever tried to do was keep you safe.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.620
I was afraid.
I wasn't thinking.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.582
I'm sorry.

38:46.666 --> 38:48.751
I know you have a good heart.

38:50.336 --> 38:53.006
You're saying that
because you want me to let you go.

38:53.923 --> 38:55.300
Look at me.

38:56.759 --> 38:58.427
Look at me, Doug.

39:01.388 --> 39:04.017
You don't have to kill Rachel.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.268
She's already dead.

39:05.351 --> 39:08.604
She died in those woods,
and it's better that way.

39:08.688 --> 39:11.274
She didn't have a very good life.

39:11.316 --> 39:15.778
But... But if you do this, you're not
killing Rachel, you're killing Cassie.

39:15.862 --> 39:17.738
And...

39:18.656 --> 39:21.909
all Cassie Lockhart wants to be
is someplace far away.

39:24.620 --> 39:27.207
Someplace where nobody'll ever find her.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.005
She likes to go to the movie theater.

39:34.088 --> 39:38.467
It doesn't matter what's showing, just...
she likes the smell of the popcorn.

39:38.551 --> 39:40.094
She wants a dog.

39:41.512 --> 39:43.264
A black lab.

39:45.808 --> 39:47.393
And a queen-size bed.

39:49.062 --> 39:52.232
Lots of blankets to curl up in.
She doesn't want much.

39:54.234 --> 39:56.694
She just wants to be invisible.

40:02.742 --> 40:04.451
Hey.

40:06.620 --> 40:08.622
Hey, look at me.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.837
My name is Cassie Lockhart.

41:15.398 --> 41:16.857
Give me your ankles.

41:23.030 --> 41:24.615
Give me your hands.

41:38.296 --> 41:39.755
Come on.

41:41.257 --> 41:42.675
Let's go.

41:48.555 --> 41:49.849
Some water.

41:58.191 --> 42:00.318
There's a town 20 miles that way.

42:20.380 --> 42:22.256
[engine starts]

43:58.852 --> 44:00.854
[shovel digging]

44:18.080 --> 44:20.916
First off, I'd like to congratulate
President Underwood

44:21.000 --> 44:23.085
for his victory here tonight.

44:23.169 --> 44:26.713
It was a tight race
and he came out on top.

44:26.797 --> 44:29.675
- [crowd] Boo!
- No. No, no, no, no!

44:29.758 --> 44:32.178
Let's not be sore losers here.

44:32.261 --> 44:35.640
Because the truth is, we haven't lost.

44:35.722 --> 44:39.226
We are just getting started!

44:39.310 --> 44:41.228
[crowd cheering on TV]

44:45.316 --> 44:48.693
I want to thank all the staff
and volunteers

44:48.777 --> 44:52.198
who worked so hard
over the past several months.

44:52.281 --> 44:53.449
We should get going.

44:53.533 --> 44:56.202
I want to try Claire one more time.
See if she'll come out.

44:56.285 --> 44:59.497
That's three hours from now,
even if she left this minute.

44:59.580 --> 45:01.290
But the crowd will wait.

45:01.374 --> 45:02.958
We don't want to squander primetime.

45:03.042 --> 45:07.004
A speech at one in the morning,
we lose major viewership.

45:07.087 --> 45:10.383
My children and my dear husband...

45:10.466 --> 45:12.677
Fine. Let's go.

45:12.759 --> 45:15.012
How do you want to handle the stage
if she's not on it?

45:15.095 --> 45:16.972
I won't need a stage.

45:17.056 --> 45:19.308
[cheering]

45:35.616 --> 45:36.992
Thank you for coming out.

45:37.076 --> 45:38.827
Thank you very much. Thank you.

45:41.163 --> 45:44.291
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

45:45.668 --> 45:47.794
[crowd cheering]

45:55.052 --> 45:58.097
Well, Iowa has spoken.

45:58.180 --> 46:00.182
[crowd cheering on TV]

46:01.350 --> 46:05.396
And they have spoken so loud,
that I don't even need a microphone.

46:05.479 --> 46:07.189
[crowd laughs]

46:07.273 --> 46:11.694
Listen, I wanted to come down here to our
campaign headquarters in Des Moines,

46:11.776 --> 46:16.741
not go to some fancy hotel ballroom
like you know who,

46:16.823 --> 46:20.578
and say to all of you
who worked day in and day out,

46:20.661 --> 46:24.749
on our behalf for this campaign,
in every corner of this state...

46:24.831 --> 46:27.918
It's because of you
that we brought it home tonight!

46:28.001 --> 46:30.254
[crowd cheers on TV]

46:32.923 --> 46:36.093
Now, I know you're all wondering
where Claire is.

46:36.176 --> 46:38.721
Some of you may know
she's been a little under the weather.

46:38.803 --> 46:39.888
She's from Texas.

46:39.972 --> 46:42.891
She doesn't understand
these Iowa winters you have.

46:42.975 --> 46:44.059
[crowd laughs]

46:44.143 --> 46:47.020
But she's on the mend and
I'm flying to Washington tonight,

46:47.104 --> 46:49.565
so that tomorrow she and I
can get on a plane

46:49.649 --> 46:53.611
and fly to New Hampshire,
where we are gonna win there, too!

46:53.694 --> 46:55.362
[crowd cheers]

47:11.295 --> 47:12.296
Claire.

47:18.843 --> 47:20.680
They told me you were down here.

47:23.390 --> 47:25.518
I just wanted to come somewhere to think.

47:27.227 --> 47:29.146
Well, I hope you have.

47:30.981 --> 47:34.234
And that whatever
was clouding your mind is gone.

47:35.778 --> 47:39.740
Because I just had to give
a victory speech... alone.

47:41.908 --> 47:47.080
And one way or another,
I need you on that plane with me tomorrow.

47:52.044 --> 47:54.714
No. The desk.

47:54.797 --> 47:56.590
Left-hand drawer.

48:07.142 --> 48:08.185
You still have this.

48:10.145 --> 48:11.647
Yes.

48:11.731 --> 48:14.650
It felt wrong to throw it out,
for some reason.

48:23.701 --> 48:29.206
When I said we were lying,
what I meant was...

48:31.667 --> 48:36.963
For all these years,
I thought we were on this path together.

48:37.047 --> 48:39.675
But it's not what I thought it would be.

48:39.759 --> 48:44.722
What I convinced myself it would be,
like what Thomas wrote.

48:44.805 --> 48:48.726
- We're two equal parts.
- We are.

48:48.809 --> 48:50.603
You really believe that?

48:51.771 --> 48:53.814
We earned this together.

48:53.898 --> 48:58.360
I said that to your face the first day
I walked in here as president.

48:59.319 --> 49:01.113
It's your office. Not mine.

49:01.196 --> 49:06.702
I have not made a single major decision
without asking your opinion first.

49:06.786 --> 49:11.540
But see, that's it.
You make the decisions.

49:11.624 --> 49:14.126
Anything that I want, like the UN...

49:15.544 --> 49:18.171
It made me ill, Francis.
My stomach turned.

49:18.255 --> 49:19.548
Why, because you had to resign?

49:19.632 --> 49:22.175
No, because I had to ask
for your help in the first place.

49:22.259 --> 49:25.220
That I couldn't get the confirmation
on my own.

49:25.304 --> 49:28.098
And what is wrong with asking
for my help when you need it?

49:28.181 --> 49:30.183
The fact that I need it.

49:30.267 --> 49:33.646
I hate that feeling. It's not me.

49:33.729 --> 49:35.689
I don't recognize myself
when I look in the mirror.

49:35.773 --> 49:39.359
I do things...
like I did in the hotel in Iowa.

49:41.361 --> 49:42.822
I can't even talk with you about it.

49:42.905 --> 49:45.282
Instead you want me
to slap you around like some animal.

49:45.365 --> 49:47.785
That's what we are
when we strip everything away.

49:47.868 --> 49:50.454
- That I can understand!
- It was deranged,

49:50.537 --> 49:52.289
begging me to take you like that.

49:52.372 --> 49:55.167
And you couldn't even give that to me.

49:56.084 --> 49:59.839
If you wanted a husband who proved
his manhood to you that way,

49:59.922 --> 50:02.842
you should've stayed back
in Dallas with your mother

50:02.925 --> 50:04.551
and married the prom king.

50:04.635 --> 50:06.178
At least I would've known
where I stood.

50:06.261 --> 50:08.806
No, you can't have it both ways.

50:08.889 --> 50:11.433
You want an equal partner
when it suits you?

50:11.517 --> 50:14.269
You want a man to take charge
when it suits you?

50:14.353 --> 50:18.148
And I'm supposed to what,
just divine when you want which?

50:18.231 --> 50:20.776
Stop being so selfish.
You're better than that.

50:20.860 --> 50:22.820
- I'm not being selfish.
- You are.

50:22.903 --> 50:25.572
We're in the middle of an election,
and look at us.

50:25.656 --> 50:28.158
That's exactly it.
Look at us, Francis.

50:28.241 --> 50:29.785
We used to make each other stronger.

50:29.869 --> 50:31.912
At least I thought so, but that was a lie.

50:31.996 --> 50:34.665
We were making you stronger.

50:34.748 --> 50:39.837
And now I'm just weak and small,
and I can't stand that feeling any longer.

50:39.920 --> 50:42.882
All right. What do you want?

50:42.965 --> 50:45.467
What is the goddamn alternative?

50:45.551 --> 50:48.679
Please, Claire, tell me,
because I don't understand.

50:48.762 --> 50:52.766
All I am hearing is, it's not enough.

50:52.850 --> 50:55.101
That the White House is not enough.

50:55.185 --> 50:58.062
That being First Lady is not enough.

50:58.146 --> 51:00.315
- Not enough!
- No.

51:00.399 --> 51:01.692
It's you that's not enough.

51:34.600 --> 51:39.605
When we lose... because of you...

51:40.773 --> 51:43.817
there will be nothing.

51:43.901 --> 51:47.071
No plan. No future.

51:48.948 --> 51:51.825
We will only be has-beens.

51:54.160 --> 51:58.122
And you want to amount to something?

51:58.206 --> 52:02.210
Well, here is the brutal fucking truth.

52:02.294 --> 52:07.800
And you can hate me, you can be disgusted,
you can feel whatever it is you wanna feel

52:07.883 --> 52:10.761
because frankly, I'm beyond caring.

52:10.844 --> 52:15.307
But without me,
you are nothing.

52:16.266 --> 52:20.144
You're right. This office has one chair.

52:20.228 --> 52:25.692
And you have always known that
from the very beginning.

52:25.776 --> 52:29.947
And if you now can't stomach that,

52:30.030 --> 52:34.409
well, then I'm a fool for having
married you in the first place.

52:34.493 --> 52:37.537
But I don't have time to be a fool.

52:37.621 --> 52:41.458
I have to run this country
and win a nomination.

52:41.541 --> 52:44.044
I'm doing my job.

52:44.128 --> 52:47.714
Doug is out there doing his job.

52:47.798 --> 52:53.595
And it's time now for you to do yours.

52:53.679 --> 52:58.809
You want me to take charge?
Fine. I will take charge.

52:58.892 --> 53:03.522
You will get on that plane tomorrow.
You will come to New Hampshire.

53:03.605 --> 53:07.693
You will smile and shake hands
and kiss babies.

53:07.776 --> 53:10.696
And you will stand with me on a stage.

53:10.779 --> 53:15.034
And you will be the First Lady!

53:15.117 --> 53:17.410
And you do all that.

53:17.494 --> 53:21.414
I don't give a damn if you vomit
on your own time.

53:50.318 --> 53:52.320
You're scheduled to depart
in 20 minutes, sir.

53:52.404 --> 53:55.281
Thank you. Check in with the First Lady,
make sure she's ready.

53:55.365 --> 53:56.700
Yes, sir.

54:04.499 --> 54:06.126
So?

54:08.545 --> 54:10.505
Are you okay?

54:10.589 --> 54:12.340
I'm good to go, sir.

54:18.889 --> 54:20.224
[knock on door]

54:20.306 --> 54:21.516
Yes?

54:23.018 --> 54:26.479
[Meechum] Ma'am, the president wanted me
to check and see if you're ready.

54:28.941 --> 54:30.400
Ma'am?

54:40.119 --> 54:41.203
Francis.

54:47.500 --> 54:49.461
I'm not going to New Hampshire.

54:49.544 --> 54:51.964
Yes, you are. I'll see you in the car.

54:52.047 --> 54:53.423
I'm leaving you.

55:00.764 --> 55:02.390
Claire.
