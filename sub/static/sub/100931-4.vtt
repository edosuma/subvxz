I've called everyone.
Nobody's heard from him.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.003
I called the police,
but you have to be missing

26:58.005 --> 27:00.003

27:00.005 --> 27:02.017

probably just died,

all the time,

where I live.

if Jim went out in the morning

you were fucking.

he's fucking somebody?

Come on.
That's not Mag's style. No.

Maybe he's fucking Jim.

27:31.002 --> 27:33.004

we all like Magnus,

27:33.006 --> 27:35.012

of shadiness to him.

27:35.014 --> 27:36.020
You sense that, right?
- Yeah.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.015
I mean, he's very flirty,

He's going through something,
but before this,

27:50.008 --> 27:51.021
he's been a model boyfriend:

super fun, so affectionate,
so great with my mom.
