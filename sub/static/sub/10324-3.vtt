12:07.526 --> 12:10.086
<i>prepared to do anything</i>
<i>to help them get friends.</i>

12:10.196 --> 12:14.257
<i>See you at the party. Everyone's gonna be there.</i>
<i>See you at the party.</i>

12:17.169 --> 12:19.069
- What the hell?
- <i>See you at the party.</i>

12:20.172 --> 12:22.299
Wait in the car.
And put this on.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.104
<i>Look. I don't know what's goin'on here...</i>

12:25.211 --> 12:27.611
but if this is just a B.O. Problem,
I've got it covered.

12:27.713 --> 12:31.410
- Excuse me?
- Dodge and EarlJunior
should be able to come to your party.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.782
- Who are you?
- I'm their mother's ex-husband.

12:34.887 --> 12:38.379
Oh, her ex. [Chuckles]
Well, then you know.

12:38.491 --> 12:43.258
I'm Phyllis Woohoo.
We've had some issues with Joy.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.796
<i>[Earl Narrating] Turns out the boys</i>
<i>weren't the problem at all.</i>

12:45.898 --> 12:48.833
Mmm. Damn!
This punch is better than sex.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.596
What's in it, sherbet?
I'm gonna need a cigarette after this.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.537
- I need a cigarette.
- Better than sex.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.370
Damn!

12:57.476 --> 12:59.967
- <i>Over the years, she made quite a name for herself.</i>
- <i># Evil woman #</i>

13:00.079 --> 13:03.048
That's how you get popular. Once your boobies
grow in, that's gonna look good.

13:03.149 --> 13:08.951
- <i># Evil woman #</i>
- Just don't let that ass get any bigger.

13:09.054 --> 13:12.820
<i>[Earl Narrating] And while some parents</i>
<i>wanted to giveJoy a chance to change, she didn't.</i>

13:12.925 --> 13:17.157
<i>Hey, Mom. Check it out. She got these</i>
<i>really cool water balloons that won't pop.</i>

13:17.263 --> 13:21.563
<i>Oh, they'll pop. If they didn't,</i>
<i>you wouldn't have those two playmates there.</i>

13:21.667 --> 13:25.626
They got into my nightstand. You should've
seen 'em playin' with the lubricated ones.

13:25.738 --> 13:29.640
Looked like they were wrestlin' a greased pig.
[Chuckles]

13:29.742 --> 13:33.508
- <i># Evil woman ##</i>
- Those boys are fine. It's Joy that's the problem.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.080
Well, Joy won't be a problem right now.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.707
She's stuck in a bubble
'cause she has a contagious infection.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.048
About time she got a real disease.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.917
She comes down with cancer
every time we need parents for a field trip.

13:44.023 --> 13:47.186
The first couple of times,
we raised money for her.

13:47.293 --> 13:50.660
Makes you feel any better,
I think she bought cigarettes with that money.

13:53.199 --> 13:57.397
Listen. As-As long as Joy's out of the picture,
here's directions for Dennis's party.

13:57.503 --> 14:02.372
Well, this sounds fantastic. And I'll still
put the deodorant on 'em just in case.

14:02.474 --> 14:05.932
Uh, you're not gonna tellJoy
what I said about her, are you?

14:06.045 --> 14:11.176
You see this? She pierced it with a kebab
after I complained the steak was too dry.

14:11.283 --> 14:14.446
I wore a hoop for a while,
but it made me a little too cocky.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.113
Anyway, I've learned
to keep my mouth shut.

14:21.260 --> 14:25.993
I got your shoes fixed. The repair guy said
to tell you to quit kickin' so many things.

14:26.098 --> 14:29.226
Yes! MyJessica Simpsons.

14:29.335 --> 14:33.066
You see what you're missin'?
You would look so good in these.

14:33.172 --> 14:38.701
<i>That's right, foot. You think about that</i>
<i>the next time you wanna get infected.</i>

14:38.811 --> 14:42.303
- Where are the boys?
- At the park for Dennis's birthday party.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.814
- Dennis who? Dennis Woohoo?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

14:44.917 --> 14:49.877
I think we were wrong about how unpopular
the boys are. They've got friends.

14:49.989 --> 14:53.948
Earl, I know my kids. They never get invited
to anything. This's gotta be a prank.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.654
<i>You know, you invite some loser to your party,</i>
<i>then tie him up, throw dog poo on him?</i>

14:57.763 --> 15:00.323
I mean, that's hilarious,
but not if it's my kids. Go get 'em.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.333
Joy, it's not a prank.
Kids like 'em.

15:03.435 --> 15:07.633
EarlJunior has cool hair, and Dodge
does wiener tricks. Just let 'em have fun.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.234
They're not gonna have fun because kids
don't like 'em! And if you won't go get 'em, I will.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.278
Joy, trust me.
Just leave it alone.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.406
Trust the guy who used to leave Dodge
at doggy day care so he could go drinkin'?

15:17.516 --> 15:19.746
I don't think so.
I'm goin' to get my boys.

15:19.852 --> 15:23.618
Damn it, Joy.
It's not the kids. It's you!

15:23.722 --> 15:25.622
People just don't like you.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.693
- Says who?
- Phyllis Woohoo.

15:28.794 --> 15:31.194
She says that you make the other moms
uncomfortable.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.198
You act trashy and wild.
People don't wanna be around you.

15:39.238 --> 15:43.470
Joy, don't beat yourself up over this.
Some people-

15:51.817 --> 15:53.842
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>It was the worst-case scenario.</i>

15:53.953 --> 15:58.049
<i>I'd unleashed a tiny pink Hulk</i>
<i>to go infect the world.</i>

15:59.458 --> 16:03.360
<i>I knew where she was goin</i>',
<i>and I knew I had to stop her.</i>

16:06.932 --> 16:09.526
- Don't do it!
- Oh, it's gonna be did!

16:11.804 --> 16:14.034
[Yelps]
Joy, what the hell are you doin'?

16:14.139 --> 16:17.700
- Ah! Slow down!
- <i># No right, no wrong</i>
<i>Selling a song #</i>

16:17.810 --> 16:21.041
- You got a dangerous disease!
Innocent people-
- <i># A name #</i>

16:21.146 --> 16:23.114
- [Yells, Grunts]
- <i># Whisper game #</i>

16:24.850 --> 16:28.308
<i>#And if the real thing</i>
<i>don't do the trick #</i>

16:28.420 --> 16:32.083
- <i># You better make up somethin'quick #</i>
- Joy!

16:32.191 --> 16:34.955
- <i># You gonna burn, burn #</i>
- <i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Joy couldn't wait to get to Phyllis Woohoo.</i>

16:35.060 --> 16:38.461
- <i>She had a lot ofbig plans in store for her.</i>
- <i># Burn, burn it to the wick #</i>

16:38.564 --> 16:41.590
- <i># Ooh, barracuda #</i>
- <i>[Crowd Gasps]</i>

16:41.700 --> 16:44.760
<i>#Oh, yeah ##</i>

16:44.870 --> 16:46.770
What's up, P.T.A. Hos?

16:46.872 --> 16:49.841
<i>Looks like I saved you the trouble</i>
<i>of unwrappin'these.</i>

16:49.942 --> 16:52.672
You're welcome.
[Chortling]

16:52.778 --> 16:57.715
- [Laughing]
- Who wants a piece of me? You? You?

16:57.816 --> 17:00.444
You, Woohoo? Huh?

17:00.552 --> 17:02.884
Who else? Hah!

17:02.988 --> 17:06.185
[Shouting]

17:06.290 --> 17:10.522
Hah!
[Cackling]

17:10.628 --> 17:13.290
[Laughing]

17:13.398 --> 17:16.561
- [Chuckles]
- <i>Come on! Lick it!</i>

17:16.667 --> 17:19.432
- Lick the toe!
- Joy! [Muffled Scream]

17:19.538 --> 17:21.801
Oh, come on, Phyllis.
Don't cry.

17:21.906 --> 17:26.105
I know this ain't the worst thing
you ever had in your mouth. [Cackles]

17:26.211 --> 17:28.111
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Joy had horrible thoughts in her head.</i>

17:28.213 --> 17:30.704
<i>And those same thoughts</i>
<i>were goin'through mine.</i>

17:32.217 --> 17:34.117
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

17:37.389 --> 17:41.689
- Don't do what?
- Uh, don't, uh...

17:41.794 --> 17:44.490
forget to make a wish.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.530
[Boy]
I wish I was a girl!

17:48.634 --> 17:51.626
[Children Cheer]

17:51.737 --> 17:56.231
<i>## [Slow Folk Rock On Radio]</i>

17:56.341 --> 17:58.866
You run like a fairy.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.946
Okay.

18:03.782 --> 18:07.912
<i>## [Continues]</i>

18:11.957 --> 18:15.950
I'm not afraid of those stuck-up bitches. I'll go
down there and make a scene up in their faces.

18:16.061 --> 18:19.155
I don't care what they think of me.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.232
I know, Joy.

18:26.338 --> 18:32.140
It's not fair that they're gonna let some opinions
they may have about me victimize my children.

18:32.244 --> 18:36.374
- It's just not fair.
- Nope. It's not.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.553
You know, there's a lot of times...

18:43.655 --> 18:45.555
when my big personality
is good for my children.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.750
Like when we were late to the movie.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.023
I scared the projectionist into replayin'
the first 20 minutes of <i>Ratatouille.</i>

18:51.130 --> 18:54.327
- They loved that.
- <i># Tonight as I stand inside the rain #</i>

18:55.601 --> 18:58.866
<i>#Everybody knows #</i>

18:58.971 --> 19:01.872
<i>#That baby's got new clothes #</i>

19:01.974 --> 19:05.205
- <i># But lately I see #</i>
- You think I'm a bad mom?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.608
<i>#Her ribbons and her bows #</i>

19:07.713 --> 19:10.273
If you were a bad mom,
you wouldn't be sittin' in this car...

19:10.382 --> 19:14.045
lettin' the boys enjoy a party
with their friends.

19:14.153 --> 19:19.420
<i>#Ah, you fake</i>
<i>just like a woman #</i>

19:19.525 --> 19:22.323
- <i># Yes, you do, And you make love #</i>
- Thanks.

19:22.427 --> 19:26.830
<i>#Just like a woman</i>
<i>Yes, you do #</i>

19:26.932 --> 19:32.199
<i>#Then you ache</i>
<i>just like a woman #</i>

19:32.304 --> 19:37.901
<i>#But you break</i>
<i>just like a little girl ##</i>

19:39.211 --> 19:42.044
[Joy]
You may wanna... wipe off the gas pedal.

19:42.147 --> 19:45.048
I was toein' it pretty good.

19:48.921 --> 19:52.152
[Randy Laughing]

19:52.257 --> 19:54.589
- What's so funny?
- Nothin'.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.888
Just somethin' Bill said
the other day.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.486
- Your imaginary friend Bill?
- Yeah.

19:59.598 --> 20:03.967
You were spendin' so much time with Joy 'cause
her toe got sick that I reconnected with him.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.970
He's workin' at a gas station,
and he's about to get married.

20:07.072 --> 20:08.972
- Good for him.
- I hope.

20:09.074 --> 20:12.237
His fianc�e has kids,
so there's baggage...

20:12.344 --> 20:14.244
plus I'm pretty sure
he's drinkin' again.

20:14.346 --> 20:19.374
<i>You know, Randy, since Bill's imaginary,</i>
<i>you could imagine him sober if you wanted.</i>

20:19.484 --> 20:22.647
If only it were that easy, Earl.

20:22.754 --> 20:26.246
It's not enough for me to want it.
Bill's gotta want to be sober for himself.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.594
Good night, Randy.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.664
Good night, Earl.
