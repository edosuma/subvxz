01:07.952 --> 01:10.978
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Move it! Move it!

01:11.088 --> 01:12.419
Move it! Move it! Move it!

01:12.523 --> 01:14.821
That means you, too, Ethan.
Head ashore, sailor.

01:14.925 --> 01:16.756
Aye, aye, sir. Head ashore!

01:17.261 --> 01:19.388
I don't know, but I've been told!

01:19.497 --> 01:21.931
Coast Guard kids got lots of soul!

01:22.033 --> 01:23.660
- Sound off
- One, two

01:23.768 --> 01:26.760
- I get the top bunk because I'm older.
- By two minutes.

01:26.871 --> 01:29.772
You know, when I was an ensign,
I always had the bottom bunk.

01:29.874 --> 01:33.435
- Did the guy above you wet his bed?
- Good point.

01:34.111 --> 01:36.171
- Sound off
- Three, four

01:36.281 --> 01:38.078
Do they have girls' boxing
at our new school?

01:38.183 --> 01:39.172
I hope not.

01:39.284 --> 01:42.714
Does not complaining about the move from
San Diego count as my good deed for today?

01:42.821 --> 01:44.254
I'd sign off on that.

01:44.356 --> 01:47.951
Admiral, this is our
12th move in my lifetime.

01:48.060 --> 01:51.723
I admire your record-keeping, Harry.
First-rate ship's log.

01:52.064 --> 01:54.089
William, what have you got there?

01:54.199 --> 01:58.431
Academy applications, SAT forms,
Capitol Hill summer internship forms...

01:58.537 --> 02:01.131
and the number of the girl
two houses down.

02:01.239 --> 02:03.207
- Outstanding.
- One, two.

02:03.942 --> 02:06.536
- So that's Christina Beardsley.
- Christina!

02:06.645 --> 02:09.239
The zip is 06320.

02:09.347 --> 02:14.216
Christina, we have just moved here.
Who could you possibly be talking to?

02:14.319 --> 02:17.379
J. Crew. I wanna make sure
they change all my shipping information.

02:17.489 --> 02:20.549
- Sound off
- Three, four

02:21.426 --> 02:24.759
Well, Mrs. Munion,
what do you think of Connecticut?

02:24.863 --> 02:28.560
I'm delighted to be here
in the birthplace of Lyme disease.

02:32.105 --> 02:34.767
I see
we're not unpacking our suitcase again.

02:34.874 --> 02:37.934
Not until you guarantee
this is our last move.

02:38.611 --> 02:41.102
You're gonna like New London, Harry.

02:42.315 --> 02:44.442
I used to live here when I was a kid.

02:44.550 --> 02:46.450
- You were a kid?
- Yeah.

02:48.855 --> 02:51.824
Hey, I didn't hear anything
about that guarantee.

02:51.924 --> 02:54.950
Well, Son,
you know the life of a military brat.

02:55.061 --> 02:57.461
New places, new adventures.

02:58.631 --> 03:00.531
This isn't our last move, is it?

03:00.633 --> 03:03.158
No, this is just one stopover
on our way to D.C.

03:03.269 --> 03:04.759
Someday our dad is gonna be...

03:04.871 --> 03:07.635
Commandant of the entire U.S. Coast Guard.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.674
Someday I am gonna be...

03:09.775 --> 03:12.005
the Commandant
of the entire U.S. Coast Guard...

03:12.111 --> 03:16.070
so don't piss me off.
Unpack your suitcase.

03:16.282 --> 03:17.408
Yes, sir.

03:36.603 --> 03:38.696
Admiral, look at that!

03:40.307 --> 03:41.274
Fiona, come back!

03:41.375 --> 03:42.933
Fiona, you're not supposed to eat pizza!

03:43.043 --> 03:46.308
- Looks like a nuthouse.
- It looks like fun.

03:46.580 --> 03:49.048
There's no ham on it.

03:57.090 --> 03:58.387
Come back!

03:59.927 --> 04:01.417
Oh, Max, I'm so excited.

04:01.528 --> 04:03.792
If you get me this private line
at Saks Fifth Avenue...

04:03.897 --> 04:06.525
I will love you forever.
This is cute, huh?

04:07.935 --> 04:09.903
Yes, thank you. This one is great.

04:10.003 --> 04:12.198
I should really get going
if I'm gonna make that meeting.

04:12.306 --> 04:14.137
I'm sorry. Do you have to keep doing that?

04:14.241 --> 04:16.072
It's in my soul. Don't look at the camera.

04:16.176 --> 04:18.873
Naoko, just back off a little bit.
Give him a little room.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.072
- Do a master shot, okay?
- Fine.

04:21.182 --> 04:24.208
Hello. Excuse me.
You wanna hear my new song?

04:25.019 --> 04:27.419
Okay, rock on. Yes!

04:27.522 --> 04:29.387
Mommy's gonna listen
to the rest of this song...

04:29.490 --> 04:31.185
when your mom and I
are finished with work.

04:31.292 --> 04:33.886
- Here you go.
- It was great, Phoebe.

04:34.896 --> 04:36.727
Helen, I gotta tell you,
I think we're set here.

04:36.831 --> 04:38.924
No, just one more, Max.
I was thinking about this one.

04:39.033 --> 04:41.331
- I mean, I don't know. Lau.
- Yeah?

04:41.502 --> 04:44.027
- What do you think of this one, honey?
- Please!

04:44.138 --> 04:47.232
It needs a little swag. A scooch of Gucci.

04:47.775 --> 04:52.144
Like this, but in gold.

04:52.380 --> 04:54.348
No one will ever doubt you're my son.

04:54.449 --> 04:56.974
- Mom!
- What?

04:57.252 --> 05:00.881
- He's painting our roses again.
- It's art.

05:00.989 --> 05:03.583
You can't call it art
unless you have talent.

05:03.691 --> 05:05.158
That's just tagging.

05:05.693 --> 05:08.321
Helen, really, I have got to go.
I think we're really good.

05:08.429 --> 05:09.896
I really should be getting out of here.

05:09.998 --> 05:13.264
Max, just give me one second. I love
this one. Just need one second, okay?

05:13.369 --> 05:15.269
Mom, there's something wrong with my sax.

05:15.371 --> 05:16.736
What is it, honey?

05:18.040 --> 05:21.009
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Sounds the same to me.

05:25.948 --> 05:28.473
What's on my head? What's
on my head? What's on my head?

05:28.584 --> 05:30.518
- Jimi, we found Rainbow!
- Don't let it bite me.

05:30.619 --> 05:32.416
- Don't let it bite me.
- Where's Rainbow?

05:32.521 --> 05:34.751
- Get it off!
- Here he is. Come here, Rainbow.

05:35.391 --> 05:36.722
- Come here, Rainbow.
- Over there.

05:36.825 --> 05:39.157
Hey, Max, thank you
for being so incredibly patient.

05:39.261 --> 05:40.489
Get back here!

05:41.797 --> 05:44.265
- This is fun.
- Fiona, come back.

05:44.366 --> 05:45.526
Mom!

05:46.568 --> 05:48.331
Aldo, are you okay?

05:48.437 --> 05:49.904
I'm shiny, Mommy.

05:50.005 --> 05:52.769
Yes, you are very shiny.

05:53.942 --> 05:56.467
Max. Max, I am so sorry.

05:56.578 --> 05:58.637
It gets a little crazy
around here sometimes.

05:58.747 --> 05:59.975
A little?

06:00.983 --> 06:02.883
No, Helen, this is all terrific.

06:02.985 --> 06:05.920
You're very talented,
and so are your 10 kids.

06:06.723 --> 06:07.781
Thank you, Max.

06:07.891 --> 06:10.451
Maybe our next meeting will be
a contract signing...

06:10.560 --> 06:11.788
and maybe it'll be in the city.

06:11.895 --> 06:13.658
Yeah. Sounds good.

06:13.930 --> 06:17.058
- Hey, Max.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:17.267 --> 06:19.098
- See you, Max.
- Okay.

06:19.903 --> 06:21.632
Okay, can you please explain to me...

06:21.738 --> 06:25.936
why you just let that very single guy out
of here without even asking for a date?

06:26.042 --> 06:29.637
Phoebe, what guy could
possibly deal with all of this?

06:40.390 --> 06:42.085
Is this all yours, Admiral?

06:42.192 --> 06:46.060
No, it belongs to the Coast Guard.
I'm just gonna run it for them.

06:46.162 --> 06:49.154
- So it is all yours.
- Basically.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.311
Frank! Frank.

07:09.687 --> 07:12.520
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you, too, Darrell.

07:12.623 --> 07:15.353
All right. "Mad Dog" Beardsley.

07:18.329 --> 07:21.162
Who'd have thought they'd ever let
Frank "The Mad Dog" back here...

07:21.265 --> 07:22.596
much less run the place?

07:22.700 --> 07:26.067
- You remember my youngest, Ethan?
- Mad Dog Jr.

07:26.170 --> 07:27.660
Can you give me a...

07:28.906 --> 07:30.134
Captain.

07:30.574 --> 07:32.633
You are out of control, little man.

07:32.743 --> 07:36.338
- Request permission to play, Admiral?
- Permission granted.

07:38.349 --> 07:40.715
I've seen Navy SEALs not as well-trained.

07:40.818 --> 07:44.083
Well, when there's eight of them
and one of you, it's your only hope.

07:44.188 --> 07:46.748
It's Mad Dog Beardsley, the pirate.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.848
Always on red alert with him.

07:49.126 --> 07:51.754
Hey, Frank, are you dating at all yet?

07:51.862 --> 07:53.693
No, no. Not yet.

07:53.798 --> 07:56.597
'Cause I know this terrific gal
I'd love to set you up with.

07:56.701 --> 07:58.601
I know you'd like her.
She's too good for me.

07:58.703 --> 08:00.295
No, Darrell. No, thanks.

08:00.405 --> 08:03.863
All right. Well, just think about it,
that's all I'm saying.

08:03.975 --> 08:05.704
- I'll think about it.
- All right.

08:36.842 --> 08:39.072
...winds out of the southeast
at 5 miles an hour.

08:39.177 --> 08:43.705
The barometer right now is 30.27
and falling, air humidity 76%.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.546
Now, there's a 20% chance of showers
for New London and points south.

09:05.104 --> 09:06.571
Way to go, Paula!

09:06.672 --> 09:09.664
Way to go, Paula! You go!

09:10.910 --> 09:13.970
- Why is Mommy crying?
- I think it's hormones.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.410
- Mom!
- Here.

09:17.517 --> 09:19.678
- Mom, do you have my algebra...
- I got it covered.

09:19.785 --> 09:21.685
- Mom, can I have $5?
- In the chicks.

09:21.787 --> 09:24.688
- Can you hand me that?
- Thank you for saving this.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.092
All right, ladies, wanna go get dressed?

09:27.193 --> 09:29.320
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go upstairs. Come on.

09:29.428 --> 09:31.020
- I'm out.
- Bye.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.620
See you later, alligator.

09:32.732 --> 09:34.131
Bye, Mommy.

09:34.233 --> 09:35.393
Reunion cruise.

09:38.638 --> 09:41.334
Oh, yeah,
like I have time to go on a cruise.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.706
Mom! Mick's dog just puked on Aldo.

09:44.878 --> 09:46.004
Sorry.

09:57.891 --> 10:00.121
- I'm worried.
- Don't be, Eth.

10:00.227 --> 10:03.287
I've done this a million times.
You'll be great.

10:03.463 --> 10:06.728
Okay, guys, fan out.
William and I will take Ethan to pre-K.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.698
All right. Everyone meet up here
afterwards, okay?

10:13.073 --> 10:14.904
Come on, it'll be fine.

10:23.850 --> 10:26.512
- I'm gonna get you!
- Superheroes, hurray!

10:26.620 --> 10:29.054
- Superhero bouncers.
- Hey, watch out!

10:29.156 --> 10:30.680
I thought you weren't interested in Max.

10:30.791 --> 10:32.918
And I thought
you weren't gonna wear black anymore.

10:33.026 --> 10:36.757
This isn't black. This is tie-dye.
And I'm not interested in Max.

10:36.863 --> 10:39.731
I'm interested in that buyer
that he's bringing up from New York.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.893
Oh, there it is. Thanks, Phoebe.

10:42.003 --> 10:43.595
Why don't you just have them here?

10:43.705 --> 10:47.004
Homes are for free expression,
not for good impressions.

10:47.108 --> 10:48.541
Incoming!

10:50.612 --> 10:52.443
If you catch my drift.

10:54.015 --> 10:56.245
Are you sure
you wanna wear the uniform, Admiral?

10:56.351 --> 10:58.319
Not that you don't look great.

10:58.419 --> 11:01.650
It just looks so military.

11:01.756 --> 11:03.986
She might as well know what she's getting.

11:04.092 --> 11:06.856
Okay,
but hold off on that eight-kid thing.

11:06.961 --> 11:07.985
Why?

11:08.096 --> 11:12.032
Because that's a minimum third-date,
second-bottle-of-wine announcement.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.432
Hey, you know, believe it or not,
I have been on a few dates before...

11:15.536 --> 11:16.764
a couple of decades ago.

11:16.871 --> 11:18.202
- Admiral?
- Yeah.

11:18.306 --> 11:21.366
Ethan, do you know
that you can call me Dad?

11:21.476 --> 11:24.604
Oh. Admiral, is this lady gonna be
our new mom?

11:25.380 --> 11:28.713
- I don't think so. It's just a blind date.
- She can't see?

11:28.816 --> 11:31.944
Can she navigate using sonar, like a bat?

11:32.053 --> 11:35.285
Hey, why don't you guys go swimming
in the bathtub?

11:35.424 --> 11:37.085
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Go ahead.

11:37.192 --> 11:39.854
- I get the boat.
- Uh-uh, you get the duck.

11:39.962 --> 11:41.953
- You get the duck.
- No.

11:42.131 --> 11:45.567
Let's just give her a little hint
of what's underneath.

11:46.535 --> 11:50.266
You know, Christina, sometimes
I wonder where you came from.

11:51.106 --> 11:52.437
Mom's side.

11:54.643 --> 11:56.577
- Don't wait up.
- I won't.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.914
And so Otter, he says, "Is she blind?"

12:01.016 --> 12:03.644
And Ely wants to know if you're a bat.

12:04.620 --> 12:05.951
Because...

12:08.857 --> 12:10.916
Would you like red or white?

12:11.026 --> 12:13.221
- Red.
- Red it is.

12:14.163 --> 12:16.495
Darrell would drink beer with everything.

12:16.598 --> 12:21.433
I mean, if he could have
a keg with dinner, he would.

12:22.471 --> 12:24.405
- Would you like to order? Waiter?
- Sure.

12:24.506 --> 12:26.303
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

12:27.877 --> 12:31.745
See? Now that is the kind of thing
that would drive Darrell crazy.

12:31.848 --> 12:34.681
"You're here now," he'd say,
"So take our order!"

12:35.985 --> 12:39.011
You talk about Darrell a lot.

12:39.122 --> 12:40.612
Well, yeah.

12:41.424 --> 12:45.121
We were married for seven years.
He didn't tell you that?

12:46.496 --> 12:47.963
Must have slipped his mind.

12:48.064 --> 12:51.898
Yeah, well, that's just like him.
I'm gonna go hit the head.

12:56.072 --> 12:57.767
Thank you so much.

13:03.179 --> 13:04.974
- Helen?
- Frank.

13:06.649 --> 13:08.173
- Helen?
- Frank Beardsley.

13:08.284 --> 13:09.478
- Well, what are you...
- What are you...

13:09.586 --> 13:11.952
- No, you first.
- No, you go first.

13:12.655 --> 13:15.715
- Well, I'm having dinner with my...
- Hi, Frank. Max Algrant.

13:15.825 --> 13:17.292
Pleased to meet you.

13:17.894 --> 13:19.555
So, what are you doing back here?

13:19.662 --> 13:22.393
- Sit down, sit down.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

13:22.933 --> 13:24.525
Well, I've been back here forever.

13:24.635 --> 13:26.626
I didn't want my kids growing up
in the whole...

13:26.737 --> 13:28.728
you know, New York money-status thing.

13:28.839 --> 13:31.933
- Yeah, that thing. That's right.
- Yeah.

13:32.576 --> 13:36.376
- So, are you in town for the reunion?
- No. I'm...

13:37.381 --> 13:41.374
I moved my family back here.
I'm running the Coast Guard Academy.

13:42.186 --> 13:43.448
- I'm an Admiral.
- Yeah.

13:43.554 --> 13:46.182
- That's why I'm wearing the uniform.
- Yeah.

13:46.524 --> 13:47.718
- An Admiral. Whoa.
- Yeah.

13:47.825 --> 13:48.951
With a family.

13:49.059 --> 13:52.790
- Well, you, too. It's great. I mean...
- Yeah.

13:52.897 --> 13:55.058
- We're ready.
- Okay. Well...

13:56.267 --> 13:58.929
- It's great to see you again.
- Good to see you.

13:59.703 --> 14:01.000
Okay, bye.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.205
Were you distracted
by his good-conduct medal?

14:11.315 --> 14:12.782
Shut up, Max.

14:14.552 --> 14:15.884
Helen White.

14:24.462 --> 14:27.659
"16,137 results."

14:29.467 --> 14:31.935
This Internet is so darn easy.

14:49.554 --> 14:52.580
Oh, God. He's married.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.521
So how'd it go with Claudia?
She's quite a catch, huh?

15:01.633 --> 15:04.295
Yeah. It's amazing you ever let her go.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.468
She mentioned she's my ex-wife, did she?

15:07.572 --> 15:09.164
Yeah, it came up.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.739
What, did you ask for references?

15:10.843 --> 15:13.539
You know, just 'cause she hates me
is no reason you two couldn't work out.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.409
You know who I ran into at the restaurant?

15:15.514 --> 15:17.175
- Uh-uh.
- Helen White.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.883
Ring a bell? Ding-ding?

15:21.687 --> 15:24.178
Helen White? Wait a minute.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.483
The Helen White?
The one you were gonna marry?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.894
Well, it's either fate or trouble.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.863
She looked great,
but I think she's married.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.559
She was with some guy, and she had a ring.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.136
Okay, that's trouble.
Come on, Frank, what are you thinking?

15:38.237 --> 15:42.640
I don't know.
I was up all night. I was Googling her.

15:43.242 --> 15:46.109
Jeez, Frank,
you Googled another man's wife?

15:46.345 --> 15:48.779
Yeah. What do you think that means?

15:48.881 --> 15:51.076
I don't know. Something dirty.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.874
Well, it's not.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.148
I just wish there was a place
I could run into her again.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.220
Remember the senior-class picnic
down by the river?

16:36.330 --> 16:37.957
- The thunderstorm?
- Yeah.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.899
Everybody screaming.
Then we crawled under the rowboat.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.264
Oh, yeah.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.505
And then, even when it stopped raining,
we didn't come out.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.664
Yeah.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.875
Anyway, that Max...

16:52.980 --> 16:55.346
he's a lucky guy.

16:55.916 --> 16:59.375
Max? You think I'm with Max? No.

16:59.487 --> 17:01.887
But you're wearing a wedding ring.

17:02.390 --> 17:05.051
Yeah, no, I am. I just never took it off.

17:05.159 --> 17:07.319
My husband passed away
about four years ago.

17:07.428 --> 17:08.452
Car accident.

17:08.563 --> 17:11.930
Oh, I'm sorry. I understand. I...

17:13.334 --> 17:15.801
I lost my wife a few years ago.

17:16.170 --> 17:17.898
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry.

17:18.006 --> 17:19.405
Flashback!

17:19.807 --> 17:22.002
Frank and Helen holding hands.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.836
- So cute.
- You wanna dance?

17:47.602 --> 17:49.797
So, how many kids do you have?

17:52.875 --> 17:54.740
How many kids do you have?

17:55.244 --> 17:56.541
You first.

18:01.383 --> 18:04.079
Okay, look,
you're gonna find out eventually...

18:04.186 --> 18:07.246
because there's too many
to hide in the closet.

18:07.456 --> 18:09.083
I have eight kids.

18:16.331 --> 18:18.492
I have 10.

18:21.336 --> 18:23.270
- You have 10?
- I have 10.

18:24.573 --> 18:27.064
- You don't.
- I do. I have 10.

18:27.176 --> 18:29.269
- Did you say 10?
- Yeah.

18:32.948 --> 18:35.917
I had four and we adopted six.

18:36.819 --> 18:38.309
I mean, that wasn't the plan.

18:38.420 --> 18:41.446
We were foster parents,
and we just fell in love with all of them,

18:41.557 --> 18:43.525
so we adopted.

18:44.026 --> 18:47.190
- Probably seems crazy.
- You don't have to explain to me.

18:47.297 --> 18:50.824
I mean, I never thought
that I'd love being a dad this much.

18:51.701 --> 18:54.568
My wife, she was the one
who wanted the big family.

18:54.671 --> 18:58.539
But now it just seems
like the most natural thing in the world.

19:06.282 --> 19:08.250
Is this really happening?

19:09.919 --> 19:11.250
I hope so.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.766
So then I asked her to marry me.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.134
- And I said yes.
- What?

19:33.476 --> 19:36.502
It was spontaneous and so romantic.

19:37.113 --> 19:39.946
- How could you do this?
- We don't even know this guy!

19:40.784 --> 19:42.376
You got married?

19:42.853 --> 19:45.378
- Without telling us?
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:45.489 --> 19:49.289
Sir, at least when you were reassigned
to Guam, there was an e-mail.

19:50.027 --> 19:51.892
Does he know you have 10 kids?

19:52.229 --> 19:55.062
- Who wants the talking stick first?
- May I have it, please?

19:55.166 --> 19:56.360
Yes, Jimi.

19:56.467 --> 19:59.732
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, Mom.

20:00.671 --> 20:02.002
We don't even know him, Mom!

20:02.106 --> 20:05.337
Okay. Quiet. I have the talking stick.

20:05.776 --> 20:07.937
He's a lovely, lovely man.

20:08.045 --> 20:11.537
And I'm sorry that we didn't include you.
And he has...

20:13.450 --> 20:14.781
Ten kids?

20:16.020 --> 20:17.044
Hey, guys.

20:17.154 --> 20:18.781
No. There's no way. Let's make this...

20:18.889 --> 20:20.288
Guys!

20:21.825 --> 20:23.315
It'll be fun...

20:24.195 --> 20:27.255
having 10 new brothers and sisters.

20:27.631 --> 20:30.964
Okay, come on, guys. Come on,
come on, group hug. Come on.

20:31.068 --> 20:32.763
- Come on.
- Okay.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.565
It's gonna be fun.

20:35.707 --> 20:37.766
But where will we live?

20:40.312 --> 20:41.609
Hey, Mick, come down here.

20:41.713 --> 20:43.544
Come on, Fiona.

21:07.138 --> 21:08.969
Okay. Head count. We've got...

21:09.207 --> 21:11.402
5, 10...

21:12.177 --> 21:16.079
15, 16, 17, 18...

21:16.414 --> 21:19.042
plus the pig.
All present and accounted for.

21:24.256 --> 21:27.157
Before you make your break
for the bedroom...

21:27.759 --> 21:29.660
could you point me to my billet?

21:29.762 --> 21:32.697
Behind the kitchen, Mrs. Munion.
How do you like the place?

21:32.798 --> 21:35.528
- It has a certain...
- Charm.

21:36.135 --> 21:37.329
...smell.

21:37.436 --> 21:41.702
Like paprika with a hint of wet dog.

21:42.441 --> 21:45.001
We're really glad you like the place.

21:45.978 --> 21:48.139
Okay. Okay.

21:49.982 --> 21:52.314
- Crew!
- Kids!

21:52.685 --> 21:56.485
All right, then. All right, kids.
Fall in for billeting!

21:56.589 --> 21:59.353
- For what?
- Room assignments.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.392
All eyes on the chart.

22:01.894 --> 22:04.089
Your rooms are numbered.

22:04.363 --> 22:08.265
Your bathroom schedules are color-coded.

22:09.869 --> 22:11.996
- You've gotta be kidding.
- Yeah, right.

22:16.475 --> 22:18.238
That's a good thing. It's great...

22:18.344 --> 22:21.370
because we all need
a little bit of organization.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.075
We do, honey. You did a beautiful job.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.046
Great. Mom gets married, we get drafted.

22:31.291 --> 22:34.783
Get back, Fiona. Get back here. Fiona.

22:36.596 --> 22:39.827
Hey, what's that badge for?

22:40.334 --> 22:41.926
It's pretty cool.

22:42.035 --> 22:44.833
- Animal skinning.
- Mom!

22:56.616 --> 22:58.846
- Done!
- You have an illness.

23:01.421 --> 23:04.754
- Hey! What are you doing?
- It's called decorating.

23:04.858 --> 23:07.554
- No, that's called vandalism.
- Whatever.

23:10.564 --> 23:11.656
Okay.

23:16.470 --> 23:18.029
- No way.
- No way.

23:18.206 --> 23:20.106
Come back, Fiona! Come back!

23:20.475 --> 23:22.067
Spit it. Spit it out!

23:22.176 --> 23:24.644
- Come on, spit it out.
- What is going on?

23:24.746 --> 23:26.611
Come on, give it to me.

23:26.981 --> 23:28.539
Where's my cell phone?

23:31.853 --> 23:33.286
You are so dead.

23:33.388 --> 23:34.912
She's just a pig.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.614
Not the pig. You.

23:38.059 --> 23:41.756
Mom, the cheerleader's after me!
Run, Fiona!

23:44.766 --> 23:45.755
Kids!

23:45.900 --> 23:47.094
Admiral!

23:47.201 --> 23:48.759
Sounds like they're bonding.

23:48.870 --> 23:50.804
That doesn't sound like bonding to me,
Frank.

23:50.905 --> 23:53.635
- They just need a little jump-start.
- Jump-start?

23:53.741 --> 23:56.938
Yeah.
Look, grab about a quart of sun block.

23:57.111 --> 23:59.011
I have a plan.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.806
Okay.

24:13.295 --> 24:16.059
So, everyone,
what do you think of the My Way?

24:16.165 --> 24:18.258
Who's gonna sail this thing?

24:18.367 --> 24:20.767
We, the Beardsley family, sail it...

24:20.869 --> 24:24.862
while you guys, I'm guessing, hang out
in the cabin and pick your noses.

24:24.973 --> 24:27.407
No, we are all going to sail it...

24:27.609 --> 24:30.601
working together like
the many tentacles of an octopus...

24:30.712 --> 24:32.543
guided by one brain.

24:32.714 --> 24:34.909
My children have separate brains, Frank.

24:35.017 --> 24:36.507
It's just a figure of speech.

24:36.618 --> 24:39.485
- No, it isn't.
- Hey, trust me.

24:39.588 --> 24:43.319
One hour at sea together,
gonna be best friends.

24:43.759 --> 24:46.057
Okay, prepare to come about!

24:47.429 --> 24:49.590
- Coming about!
- Come a what?

24:49.698 --> 24:50.960
Look out!

24:54.837 --> 24:56.327
Wasn't anybody listening...

24:56.438 --> 24:59.771
when I gave my briefing
about standard nautical procedure?

24:59.875 --> 25:01.342
I have sunscreen in my eye, sweetie.

25:01.443 --> 25:04.139
Oh, well, let's go below.
We'll wash it out.

25:04.246 --> 25:06.180
- William, take the wheel.
- Aye, aye, sir.

25:06.281 --> 25:09.581
- Mrs. Munion, you have the kids.
- No problem.

25:11.321 --> 25:12.879
Get that camera away from me.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.150
But I'm capturing
the vÃ©ritÃ© of life at sea.

25:15.258 --> 25:17.624
How about capturing my fist in your face?

25:18.194 --> 25:19.161
Hey!

25:20.663 --> 25:23.097
Look, Otter peed in his pants.

25:23.399 --> 25:25.560
No, I didn't. That's just water.

25:25.668 --> 25:27.260
It doesn't smell like water.

25:27.370 --> 25:29.304
I'm gonna go tell our dad.

25:29.405 --> 25:32.067
- I'm gonna tell my mom.
- I'm gonna tell my mom.

25:32.442 --> 25:34.410
I don't feel so good.

25:34.544 --> 25:38.412
Just keep your eye on the horizon.
I'll get you some ginger ale.

25:38.515 --> 25:41.075
- Kelly, get ready to feed the sail.
- Aye, aye.

25:44.187 --> 25:46.712
What are you doing? Come on, watch it.

25:49.425 --> 25:50.756
Raise the jib!

25:55.465 --> 25:58.866
Hey! Get me down! Get me down!

25:59.502 --> 26:02.904
Okay, get me down from here, you freaks!

26:06.477 --> 26:08.342
- Such a loser.
- Oh, yeah?

26:08.445 --> 26:10.640
Let's see how funny you think this is
from the water.

26:10.748 --> 26:11.942
- He's gonna kill me.
- Stop it!

26:12.049 --> 26:13.607
You better run for it.

26:15.219 --> 26:16.311
Oh, gross!

26:16.420 --> 26:19.150
- What's going on?
- Coming about!

26:24.562 --> 26:26.621
William! Come about!

26:27.331 --> 26:29.458
- William!
- What's going on?

26:30.701 --> 26:32.464
I'm fine, sweetie.

26:33.437 --> 26:36.770
Is this standard nautical procedure?

26:38.042 --> 26:39.031
No.

27:18.383 --> 27:20.442
Oops, missed a little spot right there.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.381
What's the matter?

27:23.788 --> 27:28.225
I'm just giving up on my dream
of having an all-family sailing team.

27:30.095 --> 27:31.790
Well, look on the bright side.

27:31.896 --> 27:34.421
You got to spend the day at sea with me.

27:34.532 --> 27:37.000
Yeah. Yeah, that was okay.

27:37.102 --> 27:40.037
That was okay? That was okay?

27:40.138 --> 27:42.038
- I'll show you okay.
- Oh, yeah?

27:43.675 --> 27:45.302
We can hear that.

27:46.544 --> 27:47.875
No, you can't.

27:47.979 --> 27:50.676
Maybe if we're really, really quiet. Okay?

27:50.783 --> 27:51.772
A little quieter.

27:51.884 --> 27:55.877
No, I like hearing their voices.
It helps me sleep.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.388
Well, I like quiet. Now shut up.

27:58.491 --> 28:01.790
- Why don't you shut up, loser?
- "Shut up" is a bad word.

28:01.894 --> 28:05.057
Maybe if we're really, really, really...

28:05.164 --> 28:06.859
Quiet. Yeah.

28:06.966 --> 28:08.991
This family is nuts.

28:15.174 --> 28:17.267
Maybe if we had a door that worked.

28:17.376 --> 28:19.810
Yeah. Tomorrow.

28:37.496 --> 28:38.929
Mom!

28:40.599 --> 28:41.896
Make her stop!

28:42.168 --> 28:43.192
That noise!

28:43.302 --> 28:46.466
Hey, reveille! Reveille! It's 6:05!

28:46.573 --> 28:49.736
Time to get up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

28:49.843 --> 28:51.606
Move it, move it, move it!

28:51.712 --> 28:53.577
Oh, my God. Who's killing a goat?

28:53.680 --> 28:57.810
All right. These are your schedules
with latrine times.

28:57.918 --> 29:00.944
You get seven minutes each.
Do not waste it.

29:01.088 --> 29:03.818
Why do I suddenly feel like I'm in prison?

29:03.990 --> 29:05.787
Fashion police caught up with you?

29:05.892 --> 29:08.486
Snap! Up top, girlfriend!

29:10.030 --> 29:12.658
- Why the drill, Admiral?
- It's not a drill, William.

29:12.766 --> 29:15.667
We have doubled our force.
That calls for increased coordination.

29:15.769 --> 29:18.533
Don't worry,
you'll soon be doing this in your sleep.

29:18.638 --> 29:20.071
I am asleep.

29:20.440 --> 29:24.103
- Can someone pass the hash browns?
- Hey, guys, give me that cereal.

29:25.679 --> 29:28.204
Kelly, can you please give me a pancake?

29:28.782 --> 29:30.181
I don't want any.

29:31.017 --> 29:32.245
Bacon, please.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.348
Thank you.

29:34.454 --> 29:35.785
Wait, I want that.

29:37.390 --> 29:39.382
- Butter. I love butter.
- Come on.

29:41.429 --> 29:43.420
Give me the syrup, please.

29:47.268 --> 29:49.429
Does somebody want to eat my oatmeal?

29:54.075 --> 29:56.066
I'm sorry, William. Is that your homework?

29:56.177 --> 29:57.474
Listen up!

29:58.412 --> 30:01.540
Before you go to school,
there's one thing we need to do.

30:04.485 --> 30:06.112
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

30:07.088 --> 30:08.521
- Hi, you've reached Frank.
- Helen.

30:08.623 --> 30:09.612
- Harry.
- Bina.

30:09.724 --> 30:10.691
- Naoko.
- Michael.

30:10.792 --> 30:11.759
- Aldo.
- Joni.

30:11.859 --> 30:12.848
- Phoebe.
- William.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.949
- Otter.
- Ely.

30:14.061 --> 30:15.028
- Christina.
- Ethan.

30:15.129 --> 30:16.221
- Mick.
- Oh!

30:39.221 --> 30:40.882
Hey, are you the freaks?

30:42.024 --> 30:44.652
I heard you have, like,
25 brothers and sisters.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.728
No, we just have 16.

30:46.829 --> 30:50.128
- Nasty.
- Dude, I hear they all sleep in drawers!

30:50.232 --> 30:53.861
And they're so poor, they all
have to share one pair of underpants!

30:54.570 --> 30:57.403
Eighteen kids!
Man, that's like The Brady Bunch!

30:57.506 --> 30:59.098
Times three. Wait!

30:59.208 --> 31:01.733
Party of Five times three,
plus My Three Sons.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.906
What? I like math.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.340
Yeah. Won't we, like... Oh, my...

31:08.450 --> 31:09.576
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:09.685 --> 31:12.279
And all the pieces fit

31:12.487 --> 31:14.887
And everything was bright

31:15.858 --> 31:19.294
Unbelievable. Not only do I
have to listen to it at home...

31:19.394 --> 31:21.123
but I'm forced to catch the road show.

31:21.230 --> 31:23.858
Well, not all music needs back-up dancers.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.433
Just the good music.

31:26.502 --> 31:28.026
- Hey.
- Hey!

31:31.474 --> 31:33.169
Forget about it.

31:33.743 --> 31:35.301
What are you talking about?

31:35.411 --> 31:39.279
Look, I've known Nick for years.
He's cute, but totally shallow.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.949
Then again, maybe he is your type.

31:45.421 --> 31:46.581
Where's the Admiral?

31:46.689 --> 31:49.886
I'm lodging a formal complaint
against Phoebe. She stinks!

31:50.827 --> 31:53.318
He's probably out dreaming up
new ways to ruin our lives.

31:53.429 --> 31:54.726
This is so ridiculous!

31:54.831 --> 31:57.891
Just because he got married,
we all have to suffer.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.400
Not necessarily.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.163
Okay, what are you doing
on Dad's computer?

32:01.271 --> 32:03.603
Just making a few changes to the schedule.

32:03.706 --> 32:05.367
Unauthorized, of course.

32:08.645 --> 32:10.408
Now this I can live with.

32:12.482 --> 32:14.973
Come on! I have to get ready for school.

32:15.084 --> 32:17.075
Your face isn't big enough
to hold that much makeup.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.518
Get a watch, hippie chick. It's my time.

32:19.689 --> 32:21.248
She's right. Our time was first.

32:21.358 --> 32:23.223
No way. I checked the schedule last night.

32:23.327 --> 32:25.022
Those evil preppies must have changed it.

32:25.129 --> 32:27.359
- We should pound them!
- Yeah.

32:27.464 --> 32:28.431
Kick their butts.

32:28.966 --> 32:32.333
To me, nothing says
"time to get out of the bathroom" like...

32:35.139 --> 32:36.538
Fire!

32:38.742 --> 32:40.607
Hey, what's going on? Watch your backs.

32:40.711 --> 32:43.202
- Where's the fire?
- Be quick. Go downstairs!

32:43.314 --> 32:45.407
Outside, outside.
On the grass. On the grass.

32:47.685 --> 32:49.414
Everyone, let's go!

32:52.523 --> 32:54.491
Okay, out the door, out the door.

32:54.758 --> 32:56.726
Go! Get out, get out, get out!

32:59.930 --> 33:02.455
- Victory to the North kids!
- Yeah.

33:02.700 --> 33:05.225
Guys, guys! Come on, let's go watch them!

33:13.510 --> 33:16.639
- Nice towel, Christina.
- Yeah, cute boxers, William.

33:16.748 --> 33:20.115
- You guys are so dead.
- At least we'll be clean.

33:20.218 --> 33:22.413
Can I get the two of you guys
closer together?

33:22.520 --> 33:25.580
- Naoko, what are you doing?
- Webcasting.

33:27.392 --> 33:28.723
Say cheese.

33:28.927 --> 33:30.258
Come on, guys.

33:32.163 --> 33:34.222
This is our talking stick.

33:34.666 --> 33:37.692
And this is a "no judgment circle."

33:37.802 --> 33:39.463
So whoever has the stick...

33:39.571 --> 33:43.029
may express themselves
without fear or interruption.

33:43.141 --> 33:45.735
So, William, why don't you begin?

33:45.844 --> 33:48.904
Go ahead.
Just, you know, say what you need to.

34:00.892 --> 34:05.158
Wait.
One of you must have something to say.

34:06.698 --> 34:08.962
Okay, if I can interrupt...

34:09.068 --> 34:11.059
I'll take the talking stick.

34:11.603 --> 34:14.129
Okay, I have something to say.

34:14.440 --> 34:19.002
In the interest
of making this house a home...

34:19.879 --> 34:23.610
I have come up with a little chore chart.

34:24.516 --> 34:26.746
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Is this a joke?

34:26.851 --> 34:29.116
Charts are never a joke with the Admiral.

34:29.221 --> 34:31.052
Look, Mom, we gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

34:31.157 --> 34:32.647
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

34:32.757 --> 34:34.157
Whoa! Whoa!

34:34.260 --> 34:36.922
I want you all home right after school...

34:37.029 --> 34:41.056
because we have to go out
and requisition supplies.

34:41.266 --> 34:43.257
- Dismissed.
- Let's go.

34:47.473 --> 34:50.737
That's a nice chart, Frank.

34:50.943 --> 34:53.844
Looks like you put a lot of work into it.

34:53.946 --> 34:56.641
And this is definitely one of a kind.

34:57.950 --> 34:59.508
Give me that.

35:01.353 --> 35:03.788
That was a disaster.

35:04.291 --> 35:07.658
Well, at least there's no blood. Yet.

35:18.138 --> 35:21.130
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Christina.

35:21.341 --> 35:23.639
You lied to me. You said he was a loser.

35:23.743 --> 35:25.734
- He is a loser.
- Hey!

35:26.113 --> 35:28.547
- A very hot loser.
- Cool.

35:29.116 --> 35:30.811
Thanks for the warning, Sis.

35:30.917 --> 35:34.114
I'll be sure to return the favor,
first chance I get.

35:36.590 --> 35:37.921
She seems sweet.

35:41.461 --> 35:45.022
Hey, Admiral,
will you build me and Aldo a sandbox?

35:45.132 --> 35:48.260
Well, sure, once we get further along
with the house.

35:48.368 --> 35:49.995
Yay, a sandbox!

35:51.338 --> 35:54.034
Okay, blue team, Spackle.

35:54.141 --> 35:56.666
Red team, insulation.

35:57.344 --> 36:00.041
- You guys, stop that!
- I didn't hit you.

36:00.581 --> 36:01.878
- Hey.
- Give it back.

36:01.983 --> 36:04.451
You want the ball? Go get it.

36:04.585 --> 36:06.576
- Where'd it go?
- Let's go get it!

36:10.158 --> 36:12.388
Hey, buddy, would you give me a hand?

36:14.695 --> 36:16.219
- It's mine.
- No, it's mine.

36:16.330 --> 36:17.797
- It's mine.
- Mine.

36:17.899 --> 36:20.231
- Mine.
- I want it! It's my ball!

36:20.334 --> 36:21.528
Give it back.

36:24.272 --> 36:25.364
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.

36:25.473 --> 36:27.338
- How do you stop this thing?
- Otter?

36:27.441 --> 36:28.703
I don't know!

36:28.809 --> 36:29.776
Otter!

36:29.877 --> 36:32.641
- Turn the wheel!
- Ely! Hey!

36:32.880 --> 36:34.313
Whoa, stop!

36:34.649 --> 36:37.641
Stop! Hey, hit the brake! Hit the brake!

36:38.152 --> 36:40.552
What, this one? Where is the brake?

36:40.655 --> 36:42.987
I don't know.
Pull that lever! I can't reach it! Pull it!

36:43.090 --> 36:44.580
- The other lever!
- It's this one!

36:44.692 --> 36:46.250
The other one. The other lever!

36:48.596 --> 36:49.756
It's the other lever.

36:49.864 --> 36:51.832
- No, it's this one.
- Oh, no!

36:51.934 --> 36:54.425
Otter! Pull the lever! Pull the lever!

36:54.536 --> 36:56.800
The other one! The other lever!

36:58.507 --> 36:59.633
Pull the...

37:02.744 --> 37:04.678
- What will we do?
- Get off it!

37:04.780 --> 37:06.338
Otter, Ely!

37:06.982 --> 37:09.678
- Admiral, you okay?
- Where are the boys?

37:09.785 --> 37:11.412
- Where are the boys?
- What?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.215
- Where are the boys?
- I don't know.

37:13.322 --> 37:14.289
Otter!

37:16.758 --> 37:18.248
Stop! Stop!

37:27.803 --> 37:29.703
Yay, a sandbox!

37:50.793 --> 37:52.658
- How's it going?
- Good.

37:53.029 --> 37:56.192
I ordered us a part that'll have us
up and running in no time.

37:56.299 --> 38:00.235
You sure are putting a lot of effort
into fixing that big old light bulb.

38:00.536 --> 38:03.994
A lighthouse without a light
is just a house.

38:04.540 --> 38:06.235
And that's a problem because...

38:06.342 --> 38:10.005
Have I ever told you the story
of the beautiful lighthouse keeper?

38:10.113 --> 38:13.810
The beautiful lighthouse keeper? No.
I think I would have remembered that.

38:13.916 --> 38:18.250
Well, once upon a time,
there was a beautiful lighthouse keeper.

38:18.354 --> 38:20.618
Wait, wait.
I thought that lighthouse keepers...

38:20.723 --> 38:23.191
were old men in yellow raincoats
with long white beards.

38:23.293 --> 38:26.751
Oh, no. This one was a real hottie.

38:26.863 --> 38:31.129
- She had long red hair. She was tall...
- Yeah.

38:31.234 --> 38:34.931
...and her body, it was the bomb.

38:36.639 --> 38:39.039
Anyway, her man was a sailor.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.610
Oh, I love sailors.

38:40.711 --> 38:44.238
And he was afraid that she'd find
someone else whenever he was away.

38:44.348 --> 38:46.782
- No.
- So she said to him...

38:47.651 --> 38:50.279
"As long as that light up there is lit...

38:50.387 --> 38:52.981
"my heart will always be yours."

38:54.291 --> 38:57.988
So, from then on,
whenever he was away at sea...

38:58.295 --> 39:02.095
he could just look back
and he'd see that light...

39:03.734 --> 39:06.897
and he knew
that his true love still cared.

39:12.810 --> 39:16.177
- Frank?
- Yes, my beautiful lighthouse keeper.

39:16.380 --> 39:18.712
We're doing the right thing, aren't we?

39:19.316 --> 39:21.284
- We've had a bumpy start.
- Yeah.

39:21.385 --> 39:22.977
Come here, I wanna show you something.

39:23.087 --> 39:24.418
- Okay.
- Look.

39:24.588 --> 39:25.646
Okay.

39:32.963 --> 39:36.161
See that? That's the buddy system.

39:37.268 --> 39:40.101
We're jelling as a family,
even as we speak.

39:41.606 --> 39:44.268
Yeah. You know, it just might work.

40:05.597 --> 40:08.395
- You have to turn it over.
- I know, Lau.

40:08.666 --> 40:11.601
- Thicker, Kelly, thicker.
- I know.

40:19.077 --> 40:21.807
Otter and Ely, playing outside.

40:21.980 --> 40:24.676
Ethan, Aldo, playing inside.

40:24.949 --> 40:26.382
Marisa and Bina...

40:26.484 --> 40:29.010
- Can we plant flowers?
- A garden?

40:29.488 --> 40:32.082
I think planting a garden would be lovely.

40:32.224 --> 40:35.557
- Yay, a garden!
- Flowers are going to be fun.

40:35.661 --> 40:37.629
So that leaves time for a little drive.

40:37.730 --> 40:40.858
I have this romantic spot
I've been wanting to take you to.

40:40.966 --> 40:42.524
I'll get my keys.

40:42.635 --> 40:45.570
Mrs. Munion, would you mind
watching the little kids for a while?

40:45.671 --> 40:48.606
Oh, sure. They'll be in full lockdown.

40:48.707 --> 40:51.335
- Good.
- Well, lockdown won't be necessary.

40:51.444 --> 40:53.810
Just check in on them every now and then.

40:54.380 --> 40:57.076
We'll be back. Mrs. Munion's in charge.

41:11.530 --> 41:13.862
Finally, a moment alone.

41:16.535 --> 41:17.866
Excuse me.

41:19.205 --> 41:22.140
Sorry. We're with quality control.

41:23.844 --> 41:26.335
- Products testing.
- I'm sorry. Oh, my God!

41:26.446 --> 41:28.710
- Just leave it. Come on.
- I'm so sorry.

41:29.249 --> 41:31.809
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Let's try that one.

41:31.918 --> 41:34.716
- Oh, my gosh.
- Better yet, let's go look at sofas.

41:36.857 --> 41:40.816
Why do I have to do all this work
just to live with these jerks?

41:40.961 --> 41:42.952
Well, what do you suggest?

41:44.898 --> 41:47.025
What, are you gonna
drop a stink bomb on them?

41:47.133 --> 41:48.964
Just watch the master.

41:53.573 --> 41:55.666
- Hey!
- Watch it, jerk.

41:56.576 --> 41:57.702
Loser!

41:58.545 --> 42:00.706
- Goofer.
- Hey, get back here.

42:02.048 --> 42:05.811
- You did not just splatter me with paint.
- What are you talking about?

42:06.987 --> 42:08.147
Is that my shirt?

42:08.255 --> 42:11.019
The one that you just got paint on?
Yeah, thank God.

42:11.124 --> 42:12.921
- Take it off.
- Hey!

42:15.095 --> 42:16.995
- How dare you?
- Don't...

42:17.264 --> 42:19.426
- Stop it.
- ...wear my clothes.

42:20.902 --> 42:24.770
- Hey, it's not a construction pit.
- You're not the boss of us.

42:24.906 --> 42:25.873
Oh, yeah?

42:27.575 --> 42:30.066
- Get them! Get them!
- Take this.

42:35.683 --> 42:39.175
- Hey, that's my Rescue Hero.
- I want it.

42:39.287 --> 42:41.118
- Give it back.
- Ow!

42:42.957 --> 42:45.289
Loser! Hit him with the chair!

42:45.393 --> 42:46.758
What's that noise?

42:58.706 --> 42:59.673
Losers!

43:00.608 --> 43:02.007
My wallpaper!

43:05.513 --> 43:08.607
- Hey, what's going on?
- Now you guys are all in trouble.

43:10.017 --> 43:11.678
You're going down, Jimi!

43:32.908 --> 43:35.741
Stop! Stop! Hey, guys!

43:37.079 --> 43:38.376
Stop! Hey!

43:38.480 --> 43:39.947
Hey, stop!

43:40.282 --> 43:41.271
Guys!

43:47.322 --> 43:48.687
Whoa! Stop!

44:06.776 --> 44:10.143
You wrecked the house,
you trashed the yard...

44:10.847 --> 44:12.576
and you painted the pig.

44:13.850 --> 44:18.480
You turned a 200-year-old panel foyer
into a Jackson...

44:19.255 --> 44:20.586
- Pollock.
- Pollock!

44:20.690 --> 44:23.921
- It was her fault for wearing my shirt...
- I am not finished!

44:24.293 --> 44:27.785
Now, your mother and I know
that you do not get along.

44:27.897 --> 44:29.990
But you're just going
to have to pretend...

44:30.099 --> 44:33.125
that you like each other
until you actually do.

44:33.603 --> 44:37.733
And until you have learned
why we think that you are all...

44:38.708 --> 44:40.266
Till you...

44:40.610 --> 44:44.376
Until you've learned
why we think you're all so terrific...

44:44.914 --> 44:48.611
we demand a level of civility
and cooperation...

44:49.185 --> 44:52.848
or I will bring the hammer down.

44:54.357 --> 44:57.417
- Is it a real hammer?
- No, no. That's just a metaphor.

44:57.527 --> 45:00.257
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared, Aldo. Don't be scared.

45:00.363 --> 45:03.060
- I am.
- Should I go get the hammer, sir?

45:03.167 --> 45:06.068
It's not a real hammer.
It's just a pretend hammer.

45:06.170 --> 45:07.762
I only said that for effect.

45:07.871 --> 45:10.362
Now, we'd like you
to all think about what we just said.

45:10.474 --> 45:12.408
Except for maybe
the part about the hammer.

45:12.509 --> 45:15.478
Yeah, forget the hammer. Let's just...

45:15.579 --> 45:17.843
Let's just get started
cleaning this place up.

45:17.948 --> 45:20.712
But first, let's have a group hug.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.382
- Come on.
- Okay.

45:22.486 --> 45:23.953
- Good, good.
- You mean...

45:24.054 --> 45:27.387
- actually hug each other?
- Yeah, that's what I mean. Come on.

45:27.491 --> 45:28.651
Frank.

45:31.862 --> 45:33.693
Yeah. Well...

45:33.931 --> 45:37.992
Gang, let's get in
on this group-hug thing.

45:38.102 --> 45:41.230
Come on, let's...
That's an order. Come on.

45:41.538 --> 45:42.971
There you go.

45:43.707 --> 45:46.005
Can't you feel the love, honey?

45:56.353 --> 46:00.153
Okay, everybody.
It's time that we call a truce.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.691
- No way.
- Over my dead body.

46:02.793 --> 46:06.092
We need to unite against a greater enemy.

46:06.363 --> 46:09.491
And that enemy's name is Mom and Dad.

46:10.901 --> 46:12.334
What are you talking about?

46:12.436 --> 46:14.495
He's saying
we are all totally incompatible...

46:14.605 --> 46:16.072
but our parents don't seem to care.

46:16.173 --> 46:18.539
Exactly. Guys, we're all in this together.

46:18.642 --> 46:20.200
Some of us are in it together...

46:20.311 --> 46:23.678
and some of us are busy
cornering the boyfriend market.

46:23.781 --> 46:26.375
You stole my shirt.
Now we're even, cheerleader.

46:26.483 --> 46:29.145
Come on, guys,
none of us likes this situation.

46:29.253 --> 46:32.950
But if we want out, then we gotta
stop fighting and get them to start.

46:33.057 --> 46:34.786
- Really?
- How are we gonna do that?

46:34.892 --> 46:39.420
Easy. Who knows what drives
our parents crazy better than we do?

47:03.788 --> 47:05.016
Helen!

47:18.002 --> 47:21.096
- Hey, I wanna do it!
- I wanna do it!

47:22.006 --> 47:24.133
Washington,
this is soldiers' morning update.

47:24.242 --> 47:25.573
This morning...

47:29.848 --> 47:33.181
Sports talk 640
and the Patriots are going for a three.

47:49.468 --> 47:50.901
Oh, no, no.

47:51.203 --> 47:53.433
Guys, where are the baby greens?

47:53.539 --> 47:55.302
It looks like Frank did some shopping.

47:55.408 --> 47:57.672
What is that smell? My God.

47:58.744 --> 48:01.076
- That's barbaric.
- Is that a liver?

48:07.653 --> 48:09.780
Well, shall we get some tea?

48:09.889 --> 48:11.789
That would be lovely.

48:11.891 --> 48:14.223
I love tea in the afternoon.

48:14.326 --> 48:16.817
I love tea, but we have to boil it.

48:18.230 --> 48:19.822
Helen!

48:20.065 --> 48:21.498
Atten-hut!

48:22.802 --> 48:25.134
Right shoulder arms!

48:27.106 --> 48:29.165
Right face!

48:31.043 --> 48:33.307
Forward arms!

48:34.113 --> 48:36.673
- Ready!
- Looking good, men.

48:37.517 --> 48:39.041
- Don't they?
- Ready!

48:39.152 --> 48:43.486
- Fire! Ready! Fire!
- Frank.

48:43.590 --> 48:45.683
- Fix bayonets!
- Frank!

48:46.993 --> 48:50.326
- What if he brings his hammer?
- There is no hammer.

48:50.530 --> 48:52.760
But maybe we're kind of crossing the line.

48:52.866 --> 48:55.096
And I don't feel right
about endangering the little kids.

48:55.202 --> 48:58.729
Trust me, they're biologically protected
by the cuteness factor.

48:59.940 --> 49:01.464
This is gonna be good.

49:04.211 --> 49:05.178
You like it?

49:05.278 --> 49:07.473
- Stop!
- Isn't it pretty?

49:07.848 --> 49:10.976
That was very naughty.

49:11.117 --> 49:12.812
What's happening?

49:13.587 --> 49:17.148
Boys, I don't think that was a good idea,
do you?

49:17.491 --> 49:18.651
- No.
- No.

49:18.758 --> 49:20.658
But that was very important
to your father...

49:20.760 --> 49:22.318
so you need to say you're sorry.

49:22.429 --> 49:23.589
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

49:23.697 --> 49:25.892
Okay, now go on and play.

49:26.066 --> 49:30.059
Whoa, whoa! That's it? "Go play"?

49:30.170 --> 49:33.698
Well, they're four years old, Frank.
What else is there? The hammer?

49:34.242 --> 49:36.176
- There are other...
- A spanking?

49:36.277 --> 49:39.872
No, honey, of course not.
We don't spank our children.

49:39.981 --> 49:41.608
The Admiral does.

49:45.653 --> 49:49.316
Occasionally, a little pat on the butt
sends a clear message.

49:49.423 --> 49:52.824
- Well, you're not spanking my children.
- I thought they were our children.

49:52.927 --> 49:55.259
You're not spanking our children.

49:56.163 --> 49:57.994
Okay, fine.

49:58.099 --> 50:00.897
Let's just let them all run naked
and wild.

50:01.002 --> 50:03.368
- Yay!
- Yay!

50:14.015 --> 50:15.710
Do you think it's working?

50:16.851 --> 50:20.082
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!

50:29.231 --> 50:32.291
The committee was very impressed,
Frank. Nice job.

50:32.401 --> 50:34.665
I take my work very seriously, sir.

50:34.836 --> 50:37.498
And don't think
that the brass hasn't noticed.

50:37.673 --> 50:41.336
- The brass, sir?
- I'm the brass, and I've noticed.

50:41.510 --> 50:43.910
I just don't like
giving direct compliments.

50:44.012 --> 50:46.037
Something about it feels unmanly.

50:46.148 --> 50:48.878
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, what the hell.

50:49.117 --> 50:52.416
Goldarn, I'm proud of you, Frank.

50:52.654 --> 50:55.248
You deserve everything
you're about to get.

50:59.194 --> 51:00.593
- Helen?
- Yeah.

51:00.696 --> 51:01.890
We got Saks.

51:03.131 --> 51:04.098
What?

51:04.232 --> 51:07.065
- We got Saks.
- Oh, Max!

51:07.402 --> 51:09.893
I got Saks! I got Saks.

51:10.005 --> 51:13.441
Thank you! I can't believe it, Max!

51:13.542 --> 51:14.804
Yeah, but don't get too excited.

51:14.910 --> 51:17.140
They wanna see a dozen new designs
by Friday.

51:17.245 --> 51:18.940
By Friday?

51:19.147 --> 51:21.878
Oh, I'm excited and scared,
all at the same time.

51:22.085 --> 51:24.485
No, you can do it.
At least now you got Frank to lean on.

51:24.587 --> 51:26.646
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

51:26.923 --> 51:28.914
Well, I better get going.
I got a lot to do.

51:37.967 --> 51:39.662
Do you like these better?

51:40.737 --> 51:43.934
- Okay. Well, then I think you're set.
- Thank you.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.268
Love you.

51:48.211 --> 51:51.772
- Sorry about the chalkboard, Admiral.
- It's all right, sailor.

51:52.815 --> 51:53.873
Hey.

51:58.988 --> 52:01.650
Why don't you just kiss her and make up?

52:05.495 --> 52:07.224
Mrs. Munion isn't so bad.

52:07.330 --> 52:09.025
You're not getting any younger.

52:09.132 --> 52:12.727
- Can we please have some privacy?
- All right. I'm off.

52:14.638 --> 52:17.106
- I'm sorry about what happened.
- Me, too.

52:19.977 --> 52:21.808
So, how'd your meeting go?

52:21.912 --> 52:24.472
Did he mention anything
about the promotion?

52:25.282 --> 52:27.375
No, not really. It's...

52:27.484 --> 52:29.509
That's just a pipe dream, anyway.

52:29.620 --> 52:32.589
- Is it?
- You're not getting rid of me that easily.

52:32.990 --> 52:34.582
- How was your day?
- Oh, my day.

52:34.692 --> 52:36.284
Well, let's see.

52:36.393 --> 52:39.055
I ate and I worked a little bit...

52:39.163 --> 52:41.961
and I made a giant deal
with Saks Fifth Avenue.

52:42.066 --> 52:43.658
- You did not!
- I did, too.

52:43.767 --> 52:46.759
That's great news. Oh, that's fantastic.

52:47.004 --> 52:50.599
- I'm so proud of you.
- I couldn't wait to tell you.

52:51.408 --> 52:53.706
Great. Well, how could I help you?

52:54.044 --> 52:56.706
- What can I do around here to help you?
- I'm set.

52:56.814 --> 53:00.910
- You need help organizing the studio?
- No, no. The studio is organized.

53:01.919 --> 53:05.480
Of course it is, yeah.
Well, I'll think of something.

53:08.459 --> 53:11.657
Guys, guys! Listen up!

53:12.030 --> 53:15.193
Your mom is going to be very busy
over the next couple of days...

53:15.300 --> 53:18.269
so I want everyone on their best behavior.

53:18.403 --> 53:21.600
- That's an order.
- We're always on our best behavior, sir.

53:24.175 --> 53:25.904
- Ethan!
- Get away...

53:26.010 --> 53:28.376
- from Mrs. Munion.
- Aldo! Excuse us! Boys!

53:28.480 --> 53:30.778
I guess we'll be doing
a little extra cleaning, too.

53:30.882 --> 53:32.008
- Ethan, this way.
- Come back.

53:32.117 --> 53:33.812
Right. As you were.

53:34.085 --> 53:35.211
This way!

53:35.587 --> 53:36.849
Cleaning, huh?

53:36.955 --> 53:39.685
Grab the other guys.
I know just where to start.

53:40.925 --> 53:43.860
Bright colors. Permanent press.

53:44.763 --> 53:46.128
Whites.

53:46.765 --> 53:47.732
Excuse me.

53:47.832 --> 53:49.857
- It's still wet.
- Socks.

53:51.536 --> 53:54.232
Michael, is there something you forgot?

53:54.806 --> 53:56.034
Shut up.

53:56.674 --> 53:58.369
That's mine.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.281
Oh, my gosh. That was so sick.

54:04.383 --> 54:05.873
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

54:19.398 --> 54:20.592
Kids!

54:20.733 --> 54:24.362
I just don't understand.
Where are my velvet, blue buttons?

54:25.604 --> 54:28.767
You know what? Why would anybody do this?

54:28.941 --> 54:32.069
- But it's clean.
- No, honey, I can't work with clean.

54:32.178 --> 54:35.909
I have a deadline. Oh, my God,
I'll never be able to find anything.

54:36.015 --> 54:38.415
My Ultrasuede used to be here,
right beneath the blue fur.

54:38.517 --> 54:40.075
Do you remember that?

54:40.553 --> 54:44.216
- Where's my fake alligator skin?
- We thought we'd surprise you.

54:44.323 --> 54:46.484
Yeah, we thought that you'd like it.

54:46.592 --> 54:50.187
The Admiral always does say,
"A clean ship is a happy ship."

54:50.863 --> 54:53.457
Hey. Wow!

54:54.800 --> 54:57.132
This place is shipshape.

54:57.671 --> 55:00.139
Well, you just had to, Frank, didn't you?

55:00.240 --> 55:01.969
- Excuse me?
- You know, Frank...

55:02.075 --> 55:05.442
I understand your pathological need
to organize the rest of the house...

55:05.545 --> 55:07.274
but this is my space.

55:07.447 --> 55:10.974
I need just a little bit of respect.
You're killing me, Frank.

55:13.286 --> 55:14.810
Did I miss something?

55:19.359 --> 55:20.383
Yes.

55:22.429 --> 55:25.489
Don't you think
you're overreacting just a little?

55:25.599 --> 55:28.625
Me? You know what? Never mind, Frank.

55:29.836 --> 55:33.101
You know, you were gonna spank the boys...

55:33.206 --> 55:35.936
over wrecking
your silly organizational chart...

55:36.042 --> 55:38.169
but I'm not allowed to be upset
about my studio.

55:38.278 --> 55:42.271
I was not going to spank them.
And charts are not silly.

55:42.515 --> 55:45.643
Do you know what happens
to a ship in chaos? It sinks.

55:45.752 --> 55:50.416
Homes are for free expression,
not for good impressions.

55:50.523 --> 55:54.460
Well, I'm sorry, but in the military,
there's little room for free expression.

55:54.562 --> 55:58.259
Except for that we're not in the military,
Frank. You are.

56:00.768 --> 56:04.704
I just thought that you would work better
in a clean studio.

56:04.805 --> 56:07.433
I knew it! I knew you put them up to it.

56:07.541 --> 56:09.509
I most certainly did not!

56:09.610 --> 56:14.411
No, maybe not directly,
but in that whole orderly, military...

56:14.815 --> 56:17.215
regimented brainwashing thing.

56:17.618 --> 56:20.519
- You left out anal-retentive.
- Oh, and that, too.

56:20.621 --> 56:22.213
Is that what you think?

56:24.292 --> 56:26.852
Yes, that's what I think.

56:27.929 --> 56:31.888
Then I think
that I'm sleeping somewhere else.

56:38.439 --> 56:39.872
I'm gonna fix that.

56:55.123 --> 56:56.647
Officer asleep.

57:15.877 --> 57:17.242
Go, Kelly!

57:18.647 --> 57:19.944
Go, Kelly!

57:20.582 --> 57:24.143
Be, be aggressive! Be aggressive!

57:24.252 --> 57:28.951
Be, be aggressive! Be aggressive!
Be, be aggressive!

57:29.057 --> 57:30.547
Be aggressive!

57:30.826 --> 57:35.661
Now put your hands up in the air
and wave them like you just don't care

57:35.998 --> 57:40.800
And if you think that Kelly is the best
let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah!"

57:40.937 --> 57:42.063
Oh, yeah!

57:42.171 --> 57:44.230
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah!

57:44.340 --> 57:48.333
Go, Kelly. Go, Kelly The other team is

57:49.278 --> 57:50.404
Smelly

57:50.513 --> 57:53.277
- They're quaking like they're
- Jelly!

57:53.383 --> 57:55.977
- We got sisters from
- New Delhi!

57:56.085 --> 57:58.451
- Go, Kelly!
- Go, Kelly!

57:58.554 --> 58:00.852
The other team is smelly!

58:00.957 --> 58:03.118
They're quaking like they're jelly!

58:03.226 --> 58:05.626
We got sisters from New Delhi!

58:05.728 --> 58:07.286
Go, Kelly!

58:07.397 --> 58:09.092
Okay, phase two.

58:09.198 --> 58:12.861
I think that we just need one more
big thing to push them over the edge.

58:12.969 --> 58:14.960
Have them catch you and Phoebe together?

58:15.071 --> 58:16.368
You're really sick.

58:16.472 --> 58:18.599
Okay, then have them catch
you and Phoebe together.

58:18.708 --> 58:20.801
How about they catch me
with my hands around your neck?

58:20.910 --> 58:23.242
Listen, the Commandant's coming
this weekend.

58:23.346 --> 58:26.679
They have to go to the trustees' dinner,
and Mrs. Munion has the weekend off.

58:26.783 --> 58:29.775
Two words, "par" and "ty."

58:30.920 --> 58:33.047
- Party.
- Yeah, I got that.

58:33.156 --> 58:36.422
No, it's a perfect idea, because Mom
won't care and Frank's gonna hate it.

58:36.527 --> 58:38.586
You guys ready? Let's get to work.

58:39.263 --> 58:40.457
Oh, no, I can't!

58:40.564 --> 58:43.362
I still have to make, like, a million
of these posters for the election!

58:43.467 --> 58:45.458
Yeah, for what, the class of '59?

58:45.569 --> 58:48.561
You couldn't get elected hall monitor
with this. Here.

58:50.340 --> 58:52.672
Imagine this in a three-color spray paint.

58:53.844 --> 58:56.369
Nice. And I know
some great campaign workers.

58:59.249 --> 59:00.807
William Beardsley for president, okay?

59:00.918 --> 59:03.751
Vote for William Beardsley!
Vote William Beardsley!

59:06.156 --> 59:09.250
Hey, Brad.
Vote William Beardsley. Great guy.

59:09.359 --> 59:10.326
Okay.

59:11.962 --> 59:13.020
What?

59:13.997 --> 59:15.055
Thank you.

59:15.265 --> 59:17.790
Thank you. William Beardsley for
president.

59:17.901 --> 59:18.868
Vote for Beardsley.

59:19.436 --> 59:21.904
Vote for Will! Vote for Will!

59:22.973 --> 59:25.498
- Here you go!
- Thanks.

59:32.750 --> 59:34.809
This could actually help get me elected.

59:34.919 --> 59:37.979
Yeah. Somebody might actually think
you're cool...

59:38.089 --> 59:39.750
if they didn't know you.

59:40.959 --> 59:42.153
That's funny.

59:43.661 --> 59:44.889
We'll be home after midnight.

59:44.996 --> 59:46.623
Make sure the kids don't stay up too late.

59:46.731 --> 59:48.699
Have fun at the trustee dinner.

59:49.334 --> 59:51.029
- Ready?
- Yeah. One minute.

59:52.637 --> 59:54.161
Are you timing me?

59:54.606 --> 59:56.767
- No.
- No. Okay.

59:58.543 --> 59:59.703
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah, honey.

59:59.811 --> 01:00:02.780
William and I were wondering if we
could have a couple friends over.

01:00:02.881 --> 01:00:05.577
You know, after we put
the little kids to sleep?

01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:08.242
Unbelievable.

01:00:08.653 --> 01:00:10.177
Can we, Mom?

01:00:10.455 --> 01:00:12.753
Yeah, sweetheart.
You have a good time. Okay, honey?

01:00:12.857 --> 01:00:14.882
- Thanks. You, too.
- All right, sweetheart.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:18.327
She went for it.
So, where are the little kids?

01:00:18.863 --> 01:00:20.091
I got them covered.

01:00:22.634 --> 01:00:25.035
Root beer chug!

01:00:39.718 --> 01:00:41.310
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:00:42.254 --> 01:00:46.418
first of all, I wanna thank
Admiral Beardsley and his wife Helen...

01:00:46.525 --> 01:00:48.493
for this wonderful evening.

01:00:48.827 --> 01:00:52.194
Frank, you run a tight ship.

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.490
You ought to see me on the water.

01:00:54.934 --> 01:00:58.563
That's why, tonight,
I'm gonna offer my recommendation...

01:00:58.904 --> 01:01:01.668
that Admiral Frank Beardsley...

01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:05.309
be my successor as Commandant.

01:01:10.082 --> 01:01:13.848
You know, Frank,
being Commandant, you'll be at sea...

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.388
wishing that you were home.

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:19.923
Or you'll be in Washington,
wishing that you were at sea!

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.824
Let's all stand and applaud...

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:26.596
Commandant Frank Beardsley.

01:01:34.307 --> 01:01:36.537
Thank you, Commandant Sherman.

01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:39.572
I know that...

01:01:41.414 --> 01:01:45.009
this command is
an incredible opportunity...

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:47.746
and a great honor.

01:01:48.521 --> 01:01:51.319
But I've just started here
at the Academy...

01:01:52.525 --> 01:01:56.427
and it would not be fair to my cadets...

01:01:57.497 --> 01:02:00.193
nor would it be fair to my new family...

01:02:01.001 --> 01:02:03.561
who just about outnumber the cadets.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.707
And so, sir...

01:02:09.276 --> 01:02:13.509
I must respectfully decline.

01:02:14.415 --> 01:02:18.408
And I hope that you know how honored I am.

01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:28.058
Think you might reconsider?
You wanna sleep on it?

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:30.187
No, sir, I'm sure. Thank you.

01:02:31.465 --> 01:02:32.659
I'll do it.

01:02:32.767 --> 01:02:34.632
Get a load of this guy.

01:02:36.437 --> 01:02:38.905
You wanna sleep on it. I understand.

01:02:50.685 --> 01:02:55.054
All the girls and the boys and people
making noises, let me hear you shout

01:02:55.156 --> 01:02:56.214
Bring them out, bring them out

01:02:56.324 --> 01:03:00.090
Pump up your fists in a twist like this
till the lights go out

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:01.320
Bring them out, bring them out

01:03:01.429 --> 01:03:05.923
Wake up, I'm calling you up I need a ride

01:03:06.034 --> 01:03:10.198
We're gonna shake up
So hurry it up, no wasting time

01:03:10.305 --> 01:03:12.398
- What's going on, baby?
- What are you doing?

01:03:12.507 --> 01:03:14.600
Oh, don't worry.
Look, I'm making the money...

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.645
but I'm gonna split it with everybody,
minus a 10% service fee.

01:03:17.746 --> 01:03:19.714
Maybe with some other friends of mine

01:03:19.815 --> 01:03:21.510
Someone's coming round to pick him up

01:03:21.616 --> 01:03:24.881
Right now I want the girls and the boys
and people making noise

01:03:24.986 --> 01:03:27.318
Let me hear you shout

01:03:27.456 --> 01:03:29.321
What is this? I didn't order any beer.

01:03:29.424 --> 01:03:32.757
Don't look at me. I just wanted
to break our parents up, not go to jail!

01:03:32.861 --> 01:03:36.820
Yeah, I don't know why I even try

01:03:36.932 --> 01:03:40.163
- I didn't order pizza.
- Well, somebody did.

01:03:40.302 --> 01:03:44.363
And somebody owes me $379, plus tip.

01:03:44.473 --> 01:03:47.499
- $379?
- Plus tip.

01:03:47.943 --> 01:03:49.501
I'll be right back.

01:03:55.016 --> 01:03:56.313
Gross.

01:03:57.386 --> 01:04:00.014
Yo, Christina. Cool party.

01:04:00.423 --> 01:04:01.754
Hey, Nick.

01:04:03.159 --> 01:04:05.650
Phoebe's out
trying to raise money for pizza.

01:04:06.696 --> 01:04:09.460
- Maybe I came to see you.
- Me?

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.958
Wow.
I can't believe you're really into me.

01:04:14.237 --> 01:04:16.330
You're hot. Why wouldn't I be?

01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:19.135
I don't know. Maybe because...

01:04:22.545 --> 01:04:24.672
Phoebe is my sister.

01:04:28.584 --> 01:04:30.950
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Get lost, loser.

01:04:36.159 --> 01:04:39.151
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- No, no, I'm so sorry.

01:04:39.262 --> 01:04:42.254
Let's promise never to let boys
come between us again.

01:04:42.398 --> 01:04:44.992
Yeah, like that's really gonna happen.

01:04:47.503 --> 01:04:48.697
Come on.

01:04:55.479 --> 01:04:56.776
Oh, no.

01:04:57.714 --> 01:04:59.682
Yo, what's up, dude?

01:05:06.356 --> 01:05:09.325
Let's just take a deep breath, Frank.

01:05:15.098 --> 01:05:16.690
Yo, B, nice hat.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.131
Ahoy, matey.

01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:21.634
Oh, boy.

01:05:21.738 --> 01:05:24.639
- Jimi, I've been looking all over for...
- There you go.

01:05:24.741 --> 01:05:25.935
Phoebe!

01:05:26.577 --> 01:05:29.171
- Hi.
- What is going on here?

01:05:29.713 --> 01:05:31.908
Mom said that
we could have some people over.

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:33.482
- You agreed to this?
- No.

01:05:33.584 --> 01:05:36.144
Phoebe, I said
you could have a few friends over.

01:05:36.253 --> 01:05:38.118
I did not agree to this.

01:05:38.689 --> 01:05:41.681
Where's everybody else?
Where are the little kids?

01:05:42.626 --> 01:05:47.529
Need more chocolate.

01:06:07.085 --> 01:06:10.350
Would everyone who lives here
please raise your hand?

01:06:14.425 --> 01:06:17.622
Anyone else remaining here
after five minutes...

01:06:17.729 --> 01:06:21.529
will be forcibly conscripted
into the United States Coast Guard.

01:06:36.314 --> 01:06:38.976
Sir, there is the matter of $379, plus...

01:06:43.389 --> 01:06:44.788
Kitchen!

01:06:45.624 --> 01:06:47.615
All right, everybody fall in!

01:06:48.394 --> 01:06:50.157
I said, "Fall in!"

01:06:50.296 --> 01:06:54.198
Dylan, Phoebe,
I am very disappointed in both of you.

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.133
Disappointed? Is that what you are, Helen?

01:06:57.236 --> 01:06:58.669
Disappointed?

01:06:58.771 --> 01:07:01.569
- William, Christina, front and center.
- Frank, take it easy.

01:07:01.674 --> 01:07:02.766
No, Helen.

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:07.437
There has been enough taking it easy
around here. That clearly doesn't work.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.513
I should have never gone
against my better judgment.

01:07:10.616 --> 01:07:12.607
This is why we have rules.

01:07:12.718 --> 01:07:15.551
Do you hear yourself?
Because it's not all about rules.

01:07:15.654 --> 01:07:18.122
You sound like some military robot, Frank!

01:07:18.223 --> 01:07:23.058
Yeah? Well, you sound like a big
Free To Be You and Me flake.

01:07:28.901 --> 01:07:31.961
You have one hour
to get this place cleaned up.

01:07:41.147 --> 01:07:43.877
There is nothing wrong with having rules.

01:07:43.984 --> 01:07:47.476
Everybody lives by them.
The entire universe lives by them.

01:07:47.587 --> 01:07:50.886
Well, then, Frank, that's the last thing
these kids need from me.

01:07:50.991 --> 01:07:52.959
There's only one rule I know,
and that's...

01:07:53.059 --> 01:07:56.927
"At any time, all of this could be over,
taken away from you forever."

01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:59.362
And then who needs more rules after that?

01:08:04.104 --> 01:08:07.562
I can't live like this anymore, Frank,
and neither can my kids.

01:08:07.674 --> 01:08:09.403
I don't know how yours do it.

01:08:09.509 --> 01:08:13.878
My kids got along just fine
until we moved in together.

01:08:14.714 --> 01:08:18.343
- Everything was shipshape.
- Oh, Frank.

01:08:18.952 --> 01:08:21.750
It's obvious that
we got into this way too fast.

01:08:22.255 --> 01:08:25.656
I thought we could just pick up
where we left off in high school.

01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:29.024
But maybe that's a lot longer ago
than we both realized.

01:08:30.263 --> 01:08:32.060
Maybe it was.

01:08:37.304 --> 01:08:39.295
Hey, you know what, Frank?

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.700
I think you should take that job.

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:45.801
- I told you, I don't want to take the...
- No, just come on!

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:48.848
We both know what your
better judgment is telling you, okay?

01:08:48.948 --> 01:08:51.417
You know what? Just please go. Just go.

01:08:56.323 --> 01:08:59.349
Does this mean you're not
going to be my brother anymore?

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.893
I don't know.

01:09:08.736 --> 01:09:12.263
Let's get this party started.
Who wants a double-stuffed?

01:09:16.143 --> 01:09:18.703
Helen cried herself to sleep tonight.

01:09:19.046 --> 01:09:21.742
We should be ashamed. It's all our fault.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:26.913
Yeah. My mom was happier with your
dorky dad than I've seen her in years.

01:09:27.756 --> 01:09:29.484
And we totally screwed it up.

01:09:29.591 --> 01:09:33.425
But this is what we wanted, remember?
Two separate families.

01:09:33.528 --> 01:09:36.587
Yeah, but I didn't know
it would feel like this.

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:38.057
Yeah.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:16.796
- Hello?
- Hi.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.502
It's me.

01:10:20.743 --> 01:10:21.903
Hi.

01:10:23.179 --> 01:10:27.115
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said...

01:10:28.284 --> 01:10:30.115
and I...

01:10:31.187 --> 01:10:35.385
I think maybe I will take that job.

01:10:52.408 --> 01:10:53.568
Well...

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:57.611
you know, Frank,
we have to talk to the kids.

01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:02.173
I'll tell them.

01:11:04.887 --> 01:11:05.945
Okay.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.251
Well, I'll see you.

01:11:14.163 --> 01:11:15.392
Goodbye.

01:11:29.046 --> 01:11:31.913
Hey, look who it is. It's the freaks.

01:11:32.382 --> 01:11:34.976
Yeah, why don't you go home to your shoe?

01:11:35.085 --> 01:11:38.680
- Shut up!
- Did you just tell him to shut up?

01:11:38.789 --> 01:11:40.757
Is there a problem, punk?

01:11:41.191 --> 01:11:42.215
What's it to you?

01:11:42.326 --> 01:11:45.454
You mess with my brothers,
you mess with me.

01:11:46.663 --> 01:11:48.153
- Sure.
- And me.

01:11:48.265 --> 01:11:50.358
- And me.
- And me.

01:11:50.467 --> 01:11:52.094
- And me.
- And me.

01:11:52.202 --> 01:11:53.669
And me.

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:55.260
It's all good.

01:11:55.572 --> 01:11:59.668
Otter, are these the kids
that have a problem with big families?

01:11:59.776 --> 01:12:03.473
- They say we share our underpants.
- That's just ignorance.

01:12:03.814 --> 01:12:06.476
And do you know how to stop ignorance?

01:12:07.684 --> 01:12:09.414
- Education?
- Close.

01:12:09.821 --> 01:12:11.288
Butt-whupping.

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:14.820
- Let's go!
- Come on!

01:12:17.595 --> 01:12:19.028
Hey, what's going on, guys?

01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:21.223
Just some kids
messing with our little brothers.

01:12:21.332 --> 01:12:23.732
- But we handled it.
- Family style!

01:12:23.835 --> 01:12:25.928
William! You won the election!

01:12:28.907 --> 01:12:31.876
Does this mean that you move
to the White House?

01:12:36.614 --> 01:12:39.879
- Way to go, Willie.
- Couldn't have done it without you, Bro.

01:13:21.026 --> 01:13:22.516
Dad, guess what happened today at school?

01:13:22.628 --> 01:13:23.595
Hey, I wanna tell him.

01:13:23.696 --> 01:13:25.163
Have you ever heard yourself tell a story?

01:13:25.264 --> 01:13:26.356
You have a tendency of rambling.

01:13:26.465 --> 01:13:28.160
Okay, listen up, guys!

01:13:29.501 --> 01:13:31.594
I have something important to say.

01:13:33.839 --> 01:13:36.273
- We're leaving?
- What? No.

01:13:36.408 --> 01:13:37.636
Do we have to leave?

01:13:37.743 --> 01:13:39.870
Look, just 'cause
you and Mom had a little fight...

01:13:39.979 --> 01:13:42.311
- that's no reason...
- It was a big fight.

01:13:43.849 --> 01:13:46.044
This whole thing is our fault.

01:13:48.787 --> 01:13:52.689
We tried to make all of you
live with people...

01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:55.487
that you have nothing in common with...

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:58.963
and that was self-centered of us.

01:13:59.265 --> 01:14:00.994
It was pigheaded.

01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:03.635
And I'd like to talk about this more...

01:14:03.737 --> 01:14:05.898
but my ship sails in a half-hour.

01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:07.598
Where are you going?

01:14:07.707 --> 01:14:10.642
I have to visit all the commands
on the East Coast...

01:14:10.744 --> 01:14:12.837
to prep for my new job.

01:14:14.547 --> 01:14:16.845
So let's lose the long faces.

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:28.527
Now, if you ever need anything,
that means all of you North kids...

01:14:30.663 --> 01:14:34.155
you just call me. I'll be there. Got it?

01:14:37.604 --> 01:14:39.037
Bye, Frank.

01:14:44.344 --> 01:14:46.073
William, you know the routine.

01:14:46.179 --> 01:14:49.410
Mrs. Munion will bring you down
to Washington once I get us set up.

01:14:49.516 --> 01:14:51.381
- But you can't go.
- Come on, Dad.

01:14:51.484 --> 01:14:53.248
- Please!
- Please.

01:14:53.721 --> 01:14:54.915
Listen.

01:14:55.356 --> 01:14:59.486
I promise everything will be
exactly as it was before.

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:01.925
This is our last move.

01:15:06.834 --> 01:15:08.301
I have to go.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.243
You're not gonna tell him
you won Class President?

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:25.908
- Doesn't matter anymore.
- What are you gonna do?

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.853
I'm gonna pack and we're gonna move,
just like every other time.

01:15:28.956 --> 01:15:31.948
So that's it? We're just gonna give in
and let this happen?

01:15:32.059 --> 01:15:35.222
- You know the drill, Christina.
- William, wait! Wait!

01:15:35.329 --> 01:15:36.956
- What?
- Please...

01:15:37.231 --> 01:15:39.631
I don't wanna lose another mommy.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.592
He's right.

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:58.518
Well, then I guess
we better stop that boat.

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.383
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.981
Kelly! Some of you guys
should stay here and wait for Mom.

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:06.492
- Got it.
- All right, as for the rest of us...

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:08.062
let's do this.

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:11.293
Ship's company! Atten-hut!

01:16:20.675 --> 01:16:22.643
I know how to cheer Mom up.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:25.178
Let's put her room back
to the way she likes it.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.009
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:46.961
Lau!

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:20.062
Help!

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:23.868
Mrs. Munion!

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:33.981
- Oh, my God!
- Mrs. Munion!

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:37.313
Help!

01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:41.317
Hold on! Hold on!

01:17:47.664 --> 01:17:48.961
Surprise!

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:51.293
Mrs. Munion, what is going on?

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:54.828
I was just vacuuming up a storm and...

01:17:54.938 --> 01:17:57.065
Where is everybody?
Where are the big kids?

01:17:57.174 --> 01:17:59.233
They all went to go stop Dad.

01:17:59.343 --> 01:18:01.504
And we stayed here to mess the place up...

01:18:01.612 --> 01:18:04.206
because you were so mad
when we cleaned it up.

01:18:04.314 --> 01:18:06.839
We changed our minds
about the plan to break you up.

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:08.941
We like living together.

01:18:09.386 --> 01:18:11.445
You planned to break us up?

01:18:14.191 --> 01:18:16.625
- Oh? Come on, kids. Come on.
- No, Mom.

01:18:16.727 --> 01:18:19.594
- What? We have to go.
- Remember the old you?

01:18:20.297 --> 01:18:22.128
Spanking is never the answer.

01:18:22.232 --> 01:18:25.759
No, honey, no spanking. Come on, kids.
I know what we need to do.

01:18:31.075 --> 01:18:34.067
- Commandant on the bridge.
- Welcome aboard, sir.

01:18:34.312 --> 01:18:36.644
- Happy to be aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

01:18:37.115 --> 01:18:40.175
Admiral, we've cleared the seaboard.
We're ready to pick up full speed.

01:18:40.285 --> 01:18:44.415
Ask Admiral Beardsley.
Soon it's all gonna be his.

01:18:44.789 --> 01:18:47.223
Frank, you give the orders.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.528
Awaiting your command, Admiral.

01:18:53.097 --> 01:18:55.395
- All stop!
- All stop, aye!

01:19:29.468 --> 01:19:30.992
Now what?

01:19:32.504 --> 01:19:33.971
It's my kids.

01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:41.445
- Drop the sail.
- Yes, sir, Captain.

01:19:41.547 --> 01:19:43.640
- Secure those lines.
- Securing lines.

01:19:43.749 --> 01:19:46.741
- Prepare to come alongside.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:19:50.856 --> 01:19:53.950
- What are you doing here?
- Stopping you!

01:19:54.059 --> 01:19:56.459
Dad, we have a confession.

01:19:56.562 --> 01:19:59.224
We were behind everything, all the fights.

01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:00.992
We tried to break you and Mom up...

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.965
so we could go back
to the way things were.

01:20:03.068 --> 01:20:04.592
We made a huge mistake.

01:20:04.703 --> 01:20:07.171
And we realize
that we should all be a family.

01:20:07.272 --> 01:20:09.900
- Come on, Dad! Come on home.
- We need to be together!

01:20:10.008 --> 01:20:12.442
- Come on, Dad, let's go home!
- We need you.

01:20:13.045 --> 01:20:16.344
I'm sorry, guys. It's already too late.

01:20:16.448 --> 01:20:18.644
Your mom is really...

01:20:34.033 --> 01:20:36.297
My beautiful lighthouse keeper.

01:20:56.322 --> 01:20:57.949
I'm sorry.

01:20:58.925 --> 01:21:00.324
I am, too.

01:21:02.595 --> 01:21:05.792
- This is where I belong.
- Yeah.

01:21:06.699 --> 01:21:08.633
And I think my kids agree.

01:21:08.735 --> 01:21:11.226
- Yeah!
- Your kids?

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.502
Our kids.

01:21:17.077 --> 01:21:20.069
- Will you marry me again?
- Yeah.

01:21:20.848 --> 01:21:23.783
Only this time, the right way.

01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:25.312
Hi.

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:44.638
- You know what we need?
- What?

01:21:44.738 --> 01:21:46.638
Group hug!

01:22:21.943 --> 01:22:23.035
- Hi, you've reached Frank.
- Helen.

01:22:23.144 --> 01:22:24.111
- Harry.
- Jimi.

01:22:24.212 --> 01:22:25.201
- Marisa.
- Bina.

01:22:25.313 --> 01:22:26.280
- Naoko.
- Michael.

01:22:26.381 --> 01:22:27.370
- Aldo.
- Dylan.

01:22:27.482 --> 01:22:28.449
- Joni.
- Phoebe.

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:29.517
- William.
- Otter.

01:22:29.618 --> 01:22:30.607
- Ely.
- Christina.

01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:31.686
- Ethan.
- Mick.

01:22:31.786 --> 01:22:32.775
- Lau.
- Kelly.

01:22:32.888 --> 01:22:35.152
- Leave your message at the beep.
- Yeah!
