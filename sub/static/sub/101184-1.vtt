of coming by your office today.

I know you've forbidden me

05:05.430 --> 05:06.263

05:06.263 --> 05:09.970
- I'm Detective Santoro from
the CCV Homicide Division.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.341
- What's this about, Detective?

05:11.341 --> 05:12.220
- [Detective Santoro]
Do you have a minute?

05:12.220 --> 05:13.370
I need to speak to you.

05:14.470 --> 05:15.720
- About what?

05:15.720 --> 05:16.553
- You're the reporter, right?

05:16.553 --> 05:18.269
- Well, yeah.

05:18.269 --> 05:19.318
- Have you heard about the two murders

05:19.318 --> 05:21.546
about the women that worked at Rigby's?

05:21.546 --> 05:22.379
- Rigby's?

05:23.470 --> 05:25.560
- You wrote that financial
inaccuracy article

05:25.560 --> 05:27.800
about Rigby's Corporate awhile ago.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.633
- Yeah.

05:29.550 --> 05:30.383
- Do you have a minute?

05:30.383 --> 05:31.350
I'd like to come in.

05:31.350 --> 05:33.180
- I'd really rather not.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.430
- This is very important.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.490
- Look, give me about 20 minutes.

05:38.490 --> 05:39.740
Meet me down at the park.

05:44.090 --> 05:47.230
- These two women, Tina
Rockford and Susan Combs worked

05:47.230 --> 05:49.550
at Rigby's and they were
murdered in the same vicinity.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.480
- Yeah, it seems like a robbery to me.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.330
- Highly unlikely.

05:52.330 --> 05:53.950
They were both killed
with a razor and a weapon

05:53.950 --> 05:57.510
we can't identify and
look, similar blunt trauma.

05:57.510 --> 05:59.010
- Well, how does this involve me?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.360
- Well, I know you cover business now,

06:00.360 --> 06:01.740
but when you were in the crime division,

06:01.740 --> 06:04.140
you're always like two steps ahead of us.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.100
I mean, you knew details and facts

06:06.100 --> 06:08.091
that us detectives didn't even know.

06:08.091 --> 06:10.560
- God, I hate business.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.510
- For example, the Fallbrook murder.

06:12.510 --> 06:15.482
You knew the murderer left
a bag of jelly beans behind.

06:15.482 --> 06:17.540
That wasn't even public knowledge.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.310
- Well, I can't divulge my source.

06:19.310 --> 06:20.750
- So you have a source?

06:20.750 --> 06:23.860
- Look, why should I help you, Detective?

06:23.860 --> 06:24.830
- Well, maybe if we team up,

06:24.830 --> 06:27.970
you can give me some intel off the record.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.290
- Mother fuck, I don't have time for this.

06:29.290 --> 06:30.123
I've gotta go.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.827
(birds chirping)

06:36.190 --> 06:37.283

06:53.403 --> 06:55.986

06:58.249 --> 07:00.310
- Yo, no soliciting.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.143
- No, Ma'am.

07:01.143 --> 07:01.976
Miss Sutton?

07:01.976 --> 07:02.890
- Wait, how do you know my name?

07:02.890 --> 07:07.715
- I, I, I...

07:07.715 --> 07:09.639
I've something...

07:09.639 --> 07:10.710
- Oi.

07:10.710 --> 07:11.820
- Wait, wait, no, please.

07:11.820 --> 07:15.395
I, I, I show you this,
just please hold on.

07:15.395 --> 07:16.495

07:16.495 --> 07:17.328

07:17.328 --> 07:18.766

07:18.766 --> 07:23.766

(gentle music)

07:27.207 --> 07:29.874
(phone ringing)

07:34.082 --> 07:36.915
- This is not what I ask you for.

07:38.330 --> 07:40.017
I ask something you're writing

07:40.017 --> 07:42.990
and you basically give
me a generic review,

07:42.990 --> 07:44.737
like some novice Yelper.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.923
- Look, I hear you, but I've
been working really hard.

07:52.670 --> 07:53.640
I'm meeting your deadlines.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.970
I'm giving you the filler
content, but for my bigger pieces,

07:55.970 --> 07:57.670
I just can't rush stuff like that.

07:58.570 --> 08:00.950
- I know this is adjustment for you.

08:00.950 --> 08:05.950
I know, but cooperate
is up my ass right now

08:07.210 --> 08:12.210
and I am paying you a
pretty penny to be the best.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.053
Now, faster!

08:15.593 --> 08:16.426
- Yeah.

08:17.801 --> 08:21.057
- I always believe in you.

08:21.057 --> 08:22.720
Always have.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.819
- [Torsten] Jennifer?

08:23.819 --> 08:24.652
- [Receptionist] Sir.

08:24.652 --> 08:26.420
- What is this shit?
- Sir?

08:26.420 --> 08:28.035

08:28.035 --> 08:29.410

08:29.410 --> 08:30.243
- Oh, shit.
- Where's my baby?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.848
- Sir, you can't go in there.
- Where's my girl?

08:31.848 --> 08:33.020
Jennifer.
- Can you go call the cops?

08:33.020 --> 08:33.929
- Okay.
- You can't just come

08:33.929 --> 08:36.450
to my job like this,
I've already told you.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.030
- I told you I needed you.

08:38.030 --> 08:39.620
I need you to come with me now.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.830
Come on.
- No, absolutely not.

08:40.830 --> 08:41.860
You can't be here.
- Come on, Jennifer.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.919
- No.
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.720
Get your hands off of me.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.083
- Calm down.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.960
Don't make the troubles here.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.194
Fuck out of here.

08:51.194 --> 08:52.265

- Get your hands off me.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.596

08:55.398 --> 08:56.231

08:56.231 --> 08:57.298
You can't just-

09:20.680 --> 09:23.053
It's all in order, everything.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.850
Except there's one thing.

09:25.850 --> 09:27.030
- [Vanson] Mm hm?

09:27.030 --> 09:29.973
- I don't like the dollar amount.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.563
You can do better than that.

09:33.410 --> 09:38.410
- But Mr. Willis, it's far more
than your company is worth.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.317
- Oh, so I see you're gonna be
insulting are you (chuckles)?

09:43.260 --> 09:48.100
Well, you can insult my
wisdom and my experience

09:48.100 --> 09:53.100
that I use for rich, hard
cash as I build assets

09:54.550 --> 09:58.130
so that you Orientals can
end up with a lot of money.

09:58.130 --> 10:02.010
- We don't mean it this way, Sir Willis.

10:02.010 --> 10:06.560
It's just that, well,
today is a new world.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.523
It's different.

10:08.930 --> 10:11.290
You gotta get with the time.

10:11.290 --> 10:16.010
- We know you've been
cooking your books, Willis.

10:16.010 --> 10:20.430
- Oh, so you're gonna be
insulting again, are you?

10:20.430 --> 10:21.763
Well, guess what?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.590
The deal is off.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.420
Who needs you anyway?
- What?

10:26.420 --> 10:28.030
- We don't need you.

10:28.030 --> 10:28.863
- Wait.

10:28.863 --> 10:32.060
Maybe we could spice it up a bit.

10:32.060 --> 10:37.060
We know you want our social
media tech manufacturing arm.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.270
Don't you?

10:40.270 --> 10:42.090
- Yes, I do.

10:42.090 --> 10:45.310
- Well, then it's all yours.

10:45.310 --> 10:49.150
- Plus an additional 13 mil.

10:49.150 --> 10:50.700
How does that sound?

10:50.700 --> 10:55.700
- Orientals want to meet
in a cancer burger joint.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.120
What's in it for you?

10:58.120 --> 11:01.017

11:58.610 --> 12:02.010
one of the early emperors
of the Manchu Qing dynasty,

12:02.010 --> 12:04.230
many whom for which were recruited

12:04.230 --> 12:05.063
by the Emperor,
(phone vibrating)

12:05.063 --> 12:08.393
and were told how to use
that fearsome weapon,

12:08.393 --> 12:09.523
the flying guillotine.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.990
The purpose of this was to suppress

12:12.990 --> 12:15.410
and cure the borders of
the former Ming dynasty.

12:15.410 --> 12:18.320
And many of those-
- Jennifer, baby,

12:18.320 --> 12:19.793
I miss you so much.

12:20.764 --> 12:24.658
- Listen, I told you not
to call my phone anymore.

12:24.658 --> 12:25.491
- Jennifer?

12:25.491 --> 12:28.530
(dial tone humming)
(pensive music)

12:28.530 --> 12:29.363
Shit.

12:31.193 --> 12:34.420
(line trilling)
(pensive music)

12:34.420 --> 12:36.174
- Stop calling my phone.

12:36.174 --> 12:39.610
(pensive music)

12:39.610 --> 12:40.443
- Jennifer?

12:41.780 --> 12:42.613
Jennifer?

12:44.730 --> 12:46.021
Oh, fuck.

12:46.021 --> 12:46.889
(phone thuds)

12:46.889 --> 12:49.556
(pensive music)

13:04.790 --> 13:07.010
- I'm so glad to see you.

13:07.010 --> 13:09.310
I am so glad that you changed your mind.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.233
The deal is gonna go through
and it's gonna be great.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.027
I really appreciate it that you're gonna

13:14.027 --> 13:15.645
come through for this.
- You're bloody perfect.

13:15.645 --> 13:16.590
- And--
- Die!

13:16.590 --> 13:21.590
(dramatic music)
(Roger choking)

13:33.599 --> 13:36.182
(gentle music)

13:39.857 --> 13:44.857
(pensive music)
(crickets chirping)

13:48.196 --> 13:53.196
(shutter clicking)
(pensive music)

14:02.480 --> 14:07.480
(Rick panting)
(shutter clicking)

14:11.187 --> 14:16.187
(gentle music)
(water splashing)

14:18.728 --> 14:19.561
Jennifer.

14:25.173 --> 14:26.006
Jennifer.

14:26.006 --> 14:28.506
(eerie music)

15:08.510 --> 15:09.343
Jennifer?

15:11.382 --> 15:13.830
- (sighs) You came here early.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.800
It went so well.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.427
Thank you so much for
helping with that vote,

15:17.427 --> 15:19.880
because it's gonna be a great deal.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.546
I can hardly wait to
see what's gonna happen.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.916
- It's gonna be just--
- Filthy spy!

15:22.916 --> 15:27.916
(Georgina screaming)
(eerie music)

15:39.460 --> 15:41.570
- This coming Saturday we have

15:41.570 --> 15:43.980

You won't leave with empty hands.

16:07.454 --> 16:08.380
Drapes!

16:08.380 --> 16:10.440
I'm sure you can use a few items here

16:10.440 --> 16:12.370
in your home immediately.

16:12.370 --> 16:13.203
It will make it feel like

16:13.203 --> 16:15.770
a different place for the holidays.

16:15.770 --> 16:17.040
A new carpet.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.910
Take another little catalog.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.930
For example, we have
amazing selection of drapes.

16:21.930 --> 16:23.160
We have shoes.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.240
- Yeah, I think I'm-
- Hairpins.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.433
I'm okay, actually.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.600
My neighbor would be a great fit for you.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.450
She's-
- I don't think

16:29.450 --> 16:30.370
your neighbor is home

16:30.370 --> 16:32.490
so let's stick here for this afternoon.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.500
- I'm really busy.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.870
I have to get ready for work soon.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.310
So, if you wanna just go ahead and leave

16:37.310 --> 16:39.220
a card or something, but I'm good today.

16:39.220 --> 16:40.053
Thank you.

16:41.530 --> 16:42.363
- You sure?

16:44.765 --> 16:46.660
The first $100 will be on me.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.470
Come to our store, pick anything you want.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.270
You won't leave with empty hands.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.920
Why don't you come the day after?

16:53.020 --> 16:55.670
We'll be open seven days a week.

16:55.670 --> 16:57.882
- You should probably just leave.

16:57.882 --> 16:58.832
- Where's the door?

16:59.725 --> 17:01.602
- That way.

17:01.602 --> 17:03.821
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?

17:03.821 --> 17:04.654
- Good.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.523
Good.

17:06.523 --> 17:09.107
(upbeat music)

17:16.551 --> 17:21.551
(shots firing)
(upbeat music)

17:23.837 --> 17:26.753
(doorbell ringing)

17:29.327 --> 17:30.926
- Jennifer, Jennifer, please, please,

17:30.926 --> 17:32.270
you need to listen to this time.

17:32.270 --> 17:34.244
There's been more murders.

17:34.244 --> 17:35.077
You need to let me in you, please.

17:35.077 --> 17:37.198
- I can't help you, okay?
- It involves, you, okay?

17:37.198 --> 17:38.031
You need to let me in, please.

17:38.031 --> 17:39.160
- Look, go to the cops.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.073
I have no information for you.

17:40.073 --> 17:41.480
- No, no, you need to know.
- They'll help you.

17:41.480 --> 17:42.660
- No, please, you need to know.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.110
I need to tell you, please.

17:44.110 --> 17:44.950
- I don't get it.
- Please.

17:44.950 --> 17:45.783
- [Jennifer] How does this involve me?

17:45.783 --> 17:46.616
What do you need from me?

17:46.616 --> 17:47.449
- If you let me in, I'll tell you.

17:47.449 --> 17:48.282
Just--
- I really don't have anything

17:48.282 --> 17:49.115
for you.
- I want to help.

17:49.115 --> 17:49.948
- I've gotta go.
- Please.

17:49.948 --> 17:50.781
- I've gotta go to work.
- No.

17:50.781 --> 17:51.614
- I can't help right now.
- I wanna help.

17:51.614 --> 17:52.860
Please, let me, listen to me!

17:52.860 --> 17:53.693
You need to let me in.

17:53.693 --> 17:55.920
You need to listen to me, just one minute.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.100
Give me just one minute,

17:57.100 --> 17:59.143
please, please.
- Cool it.

17:59.984 --> 18:01.001
Okay.

18:01.001 --> 18:03.857
(Rick panting)

18:03.857 --> 18:06.607
(birds chirping)

18:07.460 --> 18:09.620
- We really shouldn't
meet outside about this.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.603
- Well, I wasn't about
to let you in my house.

18:13.960 --> 18:14.793
What is that?

18:14.793 --> 18:17.382
(Rick coughing)

18:20.740 --> 18:22.883
- Okay, so these (coughing)...

18:26.930 --> 18:28.320
Okay.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.223
So, these four girls, what do you see?

18:33.140 --> 18:35.570
- Well, nothing out of the ordinary.

18:35.570 --> 18:37.570
Beautiful, young, probably hooked

18:37.570 --> 18:40.130
on drugs and hey, they're dead.

18:40.130 --> 18:40.990
- Well, yeah, they're dead.

18:40.990 --> 18:45.940
But look, look, all four
died the exact same way,

18:45.940 --> 18:47.230
and look at the dates.

18:47.230 --> 18:49.270
It began after your story ran

18:49.270 --> 18:51.780
and the employment of each girl, Rigby.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.407
After your story on Rigby ran,

18:53.407 --> 18:56.487
all of these Rigby girls are now dying.

18:56.487 --> 18:57.320
- Hold on.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.290
- [Rick] They're all roughly the same age

18:58.290 --> 18:59.761
and they all go to the same school.

18:59.761 --> 19:01.064
- No, no, no.
- Your story set

19:01.064 --> 19:02.210
- This is a joke.
- it in motion.

19:02.210 --> 19:03.259
What do you mean what does it have to do?

19:03.259 --> 19:05.290
It began with your story.
- You're trying to say

19:05.290 --> 19:08.620
I run an article on some
small mom and pop business

19:08.620 --> 19:10.910
that's going under and
having financial crisis,

19:10.910 --> 19:13.541
and now I'm to blame for
these girls going down.

19:13.541 --> 19:14.440
Your little conspiracy-
- You have everything

19:14.440 --> 19:15.273
to do with it.

19:15.273 --> 19:16.460
You have everything to do with this.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.050
You started it when you ran your story.

19:18.050 --> 19:19.120
- You're just looking for a
little attention aren't you?

19:19.120 --> 19:19.953
- Attention?

19:19.953 --> 19:21.351
I didn't even wanna meet outside.

19:21.351 --> 19:23.450
I wanted to keep this private.

19:23.450 --> 19:24.822
I don't want any attention.

19:24.822 --> 19:27.830
The second I have attention,
I might be on this list.

19:27.830 --> 19:30.400
I probably already am
just being seen with you.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.410
Don't you get that your
story is what triggered this?

19:33.410 --> 19:36.230
And then boom, dead, boom,
dead, boom, dead, boom, dead.

19:36.230 --> 19:37.900
Somebody in there is bad.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.330
That's why everybody, there's
somebody connected to them.

19:40.330 --> 19:41.163
I don't know

19:41.163 --> 19:42.108
who exactly that's--
- You're kidding?

19:42.108 --> 19:44.620
I have nothing for you, all right?

19:44.620 --> 19:46.270
This sounds like some weird conspiracy,

19:46.270 --> 19:47.610
you're trying to throw me into it.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.450
I don't need any more
attention right now, okay?

19:49.450 --> 19:50.283
Things are kinda crazy.
- Throw you into it?

19:50.283 --> 19:52.010
- Yeah.
- This person is gonna

19:52.010 --> 19:53.110
go after you next.
- First of all,

19:53.110 --> 19:54.066
I'm not gonna die.

19:54.066 --> 19:55.510
I didn't start anything.

19:55.510 --> 19:56.660
You want to take it up with somebody?

19:56.660 --> 19:58.820
I see you already have Santoro's contacts

19:58.820 --> 19:59.653
and good buddy,
- Santoro?

19:59.653 --> 20:00.486
- He's a detective.

20:00.486 --> 20:01.319
Take it up with him.

20:01.319 --> 20:02.285
Look-
- This guy's connected

20:02.285 --> 20:03.153
to the Rigby's.

20:03.153 --> 20:03.986
- I don't want anything
- This guy's connected.

20:03.986 --> 20:07.070
- to do with this, all right?
- This is about you,

20:07.070 --> 20:08.362
you need to.
- No.

20:08.362 --> 20:11.112
(birds chirping)

20:15.022 --> 20:16.450
(Jennifer sighs)

20:16.450 --> 20:18.810
- The boss is in an
extra special mood today.

20:18.810 --> 20:19.730
- Oh, great.

20:19.730 --> 20:20.970
- I'd watch out for him.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.235
- Here's the files you asked for.

20:22.235 --> 20:23.133
- Thank you.

20:26.712 --> 20:29.108
(Jennifer sighs)

20:29.108 --> 20:31.941
(energetic music)

20:38.629 --> 20:43.629
(shots firing)
(energetic music)

20:51.128 --> 20:54.211
(cell door clanging)

21:05.453 --> 21:07.953
(eerie music)

21:09.008 --> 21:13.641
- [Torsten] Jennifer (exhales).

21:13.641 --> 21:14.474
Baby,

21:17.040 --> 21:18.153
I want to kill you,

21:20.236 --> 21:21.153
murder you.

21:22.859 --> 21:27.859
(Torsten exhales)
(eerie music)

21:29.742 --> 21:34.742
(food crunching)
(Jennifer's tongue clicks)

21:35.885 --> 21:39.635
(Detective Santoro knocking)

21:42.080 --> 21:43.460
- Hi, Jennifer.

21:43.460 --> 21:45.517
I tried calling, but you didn't pick up.

21:45.517 --> 21:48.163
I don't wanna take too much of
your time, but can I come in?

21:52.680 --> 21:54.550
You always work here in the dark?

21:54.550 --> 21:55.860
- [Jennifer] So?

21:55.860 --> 21:57.320
- I'm actually here to help you.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.260
- Why do you wanna help me?

21:58.260 --> 21:59.270
- I like your work.

21:59.270 --> 22:00.880
- Hm, come on, dude.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.253
- Okay, I need your help.

22:03.150 --> 22:04.547
I know you have your own deep throat,

22:04.547 --> 22:07.040
but I don't want you to reveal the source.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.290
I just need your help
on something I'm doing.

22:10.380 --> 22:14.420
Maybe in return, I can help you.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.630
Such as that Omega
fortune Chinese company,

22:16.630 --> 22:17.819
you're writing about.

22:17.819 --> 22:19.463
- Look, I need some fresh air.

22:20.328 --> 22:22.850
(eerie music)

22:22.850 --> 22:25.820
So these methods that you use,

22:25.820 --> 22:27.100
I mean, they basically add up

22:27.100 --> 22:29.240
to physical assault and extortion.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.500
Look, I know you beat those kids

22:30.500 --> 22:33.200
in Chinatown to get that intel
before that CEO confessed.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.090
Everyone knows you did that.

22:35.090 --> 22:36.420
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.650
I mean, I know what we do, how we do it,

22:38.650 --> 22:40.640
I'm not proud of it but we always catch

22:40.640 --> 22:41.730
the bad guy in the end.

22:41.730 --> 22:42.698
- [Jennifer] Not always.

22:42.698 --> 22:44.620
- (chuckles) That's what I like about you.

22:44.620 --> 22:45.920
You're not cruel like us.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.760
You're more sophisticated,
something our department lacks.

22:48.760 --> 22:49.870
- So let me get this straight.

22:49.870 --> 22:52.080
You wanna trade intel with
me from tortured people

22:52.080 --> 22:54.131
in order to help me with my Omega article.

22:54.131 --> 22:59.131
(shutter clicking)
(eerie music)

23:07.080 --> 23:09.000
- No, no, not tortured,
more like influence

23:09.000 --> 23:10.930
under strong circumstances.

23:10.930 --> 23:11.830
- Same thing.

23:11.830 --> 23:13.270
- Yeah, I know.

23:13.270 --> 23:15.780
Listen, there was another murder today.

23:15.780 --> 23:19.950
Same thing she was, worked at
Rigby's, different franchise,

23:19.950 --> 23:22.370
same ownership, same age as the others.

23:22.370 --> 23:24.490
Her name was Molly Fernwood.

23:24.490 --> 23:25.323
- Shit!

23:30.246 --> 23:32.795
(eerie music)

23:32.795 --> 23:34.250
(buzzer buzzing)

23:34.250 --> 23:37.250
- Hey, guard, when is it chow time?

23:37.250 --> 23:38.560
I'm hungry here.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.721
Come on, man!

23:39.721 --> 23:42.221
(eerie music)

23:46.120 --> 23:48.127
Oh man, thanks a lot, man.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.400
I'm hungry.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.590
I haven't eaten for two days, man.

23:50.590 --> 23:51.530
What's goin' on?

23:51.530 --> 23:52.650
Thanks a lot, man.
- You're welcome.

23:52.650 --> 23:53.643
- Appreciate it.

23:53.643 --> 23:54.476
Mm.

23:55.727 --> 23:56.560
Mm.

23:57.578 --> 23:58.411
Real good.

23:58.411 --> 24:00.007
Mm.

24:00.007 --> 24:01.532
Mm.

24:01.532 --> 24:03.629
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

24:03.629 --> 24:06.046
(man sighs)

24:09.588 --> 24:10.928
(phone vibrating)

24:10.928 --> 24:11.761
- Shit.

24:14.565 --> 24:15.603
Of course.

24:15.603 --> 24:20.603
(Jennifer exhaling)
(phone vibrating)

24:21.950 --> 24:22.783
Yeah?

24:24.015 --> 24:26.210
(Torsten sighs)

24:26.210 --> 24:27.043
Tor?

24:29.440 --> 24:30.333
Is that you?

24:31.660 --> 24:34.593
- Jennifer, baby, I miss you so much.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.640
- God (sighs).

24:37.640 --> 24:38.473
No.

24:39.941 --> 24:40.991
- [Torsten] Jennifer?

24:43.383 --> 24:46.300
(phone vibrating)

24:49.162 --> 24:50.265
- What do you want?

24:50.265 --> 24:51.098
- [Tprsten] You.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.229
I want you, all of you.

24:53.229 --> 24:54.440
- Ugh.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.840
Look, it's not gonna happen.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.963
Are you drunk?

24:59.235 --> 25:01.018
(Torsten sighs)

25:01.018 --> 25:02.418
- [Torsten] I will take you.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.750
- Tor, get lost buddy.

25:05.750 --> 25:06.731
- [Torsten] Jennifer!

25:06.731 --> 25:07.564
- Fucker.

25:08.570 --> 25:09.403
Shit.

25:10.823 --> 25:12.779
(Jennifer sighs)

25:12.779 --> 25:14.580
(crickets chirping)

25:14.580 --> 25:19.580
(eerie music)
(heartbeat pounding)

25:30.390 --> 25:35.390
(eerie music)
(man choking)

25:38.527 --> 25:43.527
(eerie music)
(heartbeat pounding)

25:44.430 --> 25:46.270
- Well, I mean, I've been
in this area a lot lately

25:46.270 --> 25:50.216
because I'm investigating
two different murders.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.690
- I know of the murders.

25:51.690 --> 25:54.130
- I know you have and my thing is that

25:54.130 --> 25:57.094
like I said earlier before,
I've always admired you

25:57.094 --> 25:58.980
and I always feel like you're always

25:58.980 --> 26:00.503
two steps ahead of the curve.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.540
And with me with homicide, we come in,

26:04.540 --> 26:06.810
a lotta times evidence is gone,

26:06.810 --> 26:09.820
witnesses are gone that we wanna talk to.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.810
But you as a reporter, seem like you get

26:11.810 --> 26:14.880
in there early enough and
I just wanna find out,

26:14.880 --> 26:18.010
is there anyone that maybe I've missed?

26:18.010 --> 26:19.350
- I don't really know
what you want from me.

26:19.350 --> 26:22.070
I don't think I can help
you with this specific case.

26:22.070 --> 26:23.620
- I think we can work together.

26:26.110 --> 26:28.090
- Look, I'm really just
kind of a lone ranger

26:28.090 --> 26:29.300
when it comes to this sorta thing.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.600
I work alone.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.503
- Yeah, don't we all?

26:33.740 --> 26:34.830
(Jennifer sighs)

26:34.830 --> 26:37.619
Anything else that you can tell me?

26:37.619 --> 26:40.180
Anything out of the ordinary or anything?

26:40.180 --> 26:41.920
- I mean, there's been this weird dude

26:41.920 --> 26:44.477
coming around my house,
just conspiracy vibes,

26:44.477 --> 26:45.730
knockin' on my door.

26:45.730 --> 26:49.100
He just won't fuck off
really, but that's it.

26:49.100 --> 26:49.933
I have nothing.

26:49.933 --> 26:50.766
I have nothing for you.

26:50.766 --> 26:52.510
- What does he look like?

26:52.510 --> 26:55.750
- Just your typical,
sweaty guy that thinks

26:55.750 --> 26:58.400
he knows how to uncover all of this mess

26:58.400 --> 27:00.830
and I'm just not interested
in talking to him.

27:00.830 --> 27:02.450
- Well, that's very helpful.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.720
See, I feel like if we work together,

27:04.720 --> 27:07.340
we can find out the truth
behind these murders,

27:07.340 --> 27:08.980
get the facts.
- I've got enough drama

27:08.980 --> 27:10.040
in my life right now.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.570
I really don't need to
go down this road, okay?

27:12.570 --> 27:14.780
So, I don't really know
how to put it for you.

27:14.780 --> 27:16.963
I have nothing for you.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.980
- Look, the only thing I'm
asking for is just think about it

27:21.980 --> 27:23.050
for a couple of days, okay?

27:23.050 --> 27:25.990
- Well, I've got a lot
to think about friend.

27:25.990 --> 27:26.950
- We all do.

27:26.950 --> 27:29.020
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.

27:29.020 --> 27:29.853
Let's just try to do something

27:29.853 --> 27:31.393
before something else happens.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.610
That guy comes back, let me know.

27:36.492 --> 27:38.992
(eerie music)

27:46.139 --> 27:48.889
(food crunching)

27:52.450 --> 27:53.283
(Jennifer sighs)

27:53.283 --> 27:55.950
(phone ringing)

27:57.440 --> 27:58.273
- Hello?

27:58.273 --> 28:03.267
(eerie music)
(birds chirping)

28:13.890 --> 28:14.993
- [Victoria] Miss Sutton?

28:17.134 --> 28:18.240
Miss Sutton?

28:18.240 --> 28:19.415
- Yeah.

28:19.415 --> 28:20.573
- Victoria Harris.

28:23.090 --> 28:24.870
- And how do you know me, Victoria?

28:24.870 --> 28:28.950
- I've read your articles about
the whole mess at Rigby's.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.533
I knew Tina Rockford.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.363
In fact, I was really good
friends with Tina Rockford.

28:41.530 --> 28:42.670
- Look, I'm sorry about your friend,

28:42.670 --> 28:45.080
but why are you coming to
me with this information?

28:45.080 --> 28:49.360
- The thing is, the week
before she was murdered,

28:49.360 --> 28:50.310
she wasn't herself.

28:52.910 --> 28:56.770
She was just so, so restless,

28:56.770 --> 28:59.950
and she kept referencing
this woman named Gretchen.

28:59.950 --> 29:01.430
- Gretchen?

29:01.430 --> 29:02.705
- Yeah.

29:02.705 --> 29:06.220
Gretchen was paying her for information

29:06.220 --> 29:09.700
on Rigby's except it seemed like

29:09.700 --> 29:13.023
she kept wanting more and
more information from her.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.823
The whole thing just seemed
kind of disingenuous.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.483
The day before she died,
she wasn't herself.

29:28.730 --> 29:31.210
She kept speaking nonsensically.

29:34.134 --> 29:36.477
The whole thing was just really awful,

29:38.130 --> 29:40.658
and I'm kind of scared.

29:40.658 --> 29:43.241
(solemn music)

29:54.560 --> 29:57.510
(phone ringing)

29:57.510 --> 29:58.343
- Yes?

29:58.343 --> 30:00.660
- [Gretchen] I have
something you want, my dear.

30:00.660 --> 30:01.493
- What's this about?

30:01.493 --> 30:04.520
- [Gretchen] Meet me at the
lab's warehouse at 3:00 p.m.

30:04.520 --> 30:05.620
- I'll be right there.

30:10.675 --> 30:13.175
(eerie music)

30:28.719 --> 30:29.552
Hello?

30:30.493 --> 30:32.326
- [Gretchen] Jennifer?

30:35.088 --> 30:35.921
Jennifer?

30:38.920 --> 30:39.753
- Gretchen?

30:39.753 --> 30:42.200
(eerie music)

30:46.700 --> 30:49.020
- Well, that's not my real name,

30:49.020 --> 30:52.543
but let's just stick
with Gretchen for now.

30:53.380 --> 30:54.590
- Why meet here?

30:54.590 --> 30:57.070
- Isn't this a glamorous atmosphere?

30:57.070 --> 30:59.950
I figured it was time for
a meeting tete-a-tete.

30:59.950 --> 31:02.340
You know, face-to-face with
all the hacking and all.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.210
- Look, you want something
more from me, right?

31:04.210 --> 31:05.043
Money?

31:05.910 --> 31:07.296
Could you just tell me what
you know about the murders

31:07.296 --> 31:10.450
of Tina Rockford and Susan Combs?

31:10.450 --> 31:11.743
- No need to jump ahead.

31:12.830 --> 31:16.543
Let's just say the plot's
thickening, new players involved.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.763
Agatha Christie didn't
introduce new characters

31:19.763 --> 31:21.953
this early in the second act,

31:23.361 --> 31:26.770
but I know who you've
been talking to lately.

31:26.770 --> 31:27.750
- Okay, Miss Marple.

31:27.750 --> 31:28.983
Just name your price.

31:29.981 --> 31:33.240
Look, I don't want this fucking job.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.507
My boss is an asshole
and he's all over me.

31:35.507 --> 31:38.240
And now I'm standing in some
random warehouse meeting

31:38.240 --> 31:40.030
with strange people.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.453
I must have a death wish.

31:42.530 --> 31:45.400
- I'm gonna make you a
star with this, Jennifer.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.620
Think Allah, Woodward and Bernstein.

31:48.620 --> 31:49.453
- Okay.

31:50.360 --> 31:53.013
- I'll meet you again in
two days with an update.

31:53.013 --> 31:54.710
Any place you choose,

31:54.710 --> 31:57.095
I just needed to find out

31:57.095 --> 31:58.130
what (speaking in foreign language)

31:58.130 --> 31:59.593
you have meeting me here.

32:00.530 --> 32:01.660
And now I see that you're

32:01.660 --> 32:04.000
a real trooper dedicated to your craft.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.923
Not easy in these crazy times.

32:08.570 --> 32:09.403
- Hey, wait.

32:11.010 --> 32:12.410
- You'll be hearing from me.

32:13.857 --> 32:14.690
Toodlaloo.

32:14.690 --> 32:17.190
(eerie music)

(Jennifer sighs)

33:40.870 --> 33:42.340
- Hello?

33:42.340 --> 33:45.600
- [Torsten] Jennifer,
baby, I miss you so much.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.200
- Look, I told you to stop
fucking calling my phone.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.820
(Jennifer sighs)

33:58.687 --> 34:01.354
(phone ringing)

34:02.510 --> 34:03.674
This is Jennifer.

34:03.674 --> 34:04.529
- [Detective Santoro] Hi Jennifer.

34:04.529 --> 34:06.420
It's Detective Santoro.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.449
- Hey.

34:07.449 --> 34:08.600
- [Detective Santoro] I
couldn't track you down.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.239
I thought maybe you took a sick day.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.415
(Jennifer chuckles)

34:11.415 --> 34:12.632
- I did not.

34:12.632 --> 34:13.465
- [Detective Santoro] Can you talk?

34:13.465 --> 34:15.270
I wanna share some info on all this.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.103
- That sounds great.

34:16.103 --> 34:16.936
How 'bout later?

34:16.936 --> 34:18.239
- [Detective Santoro] We'll
have to include dinner as well.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.650
- I will call you when I get off.

34:19.650 --> 34:21.120
- [Detective Santoro] I'll
be waiting for your call.

34:21.120 --> 34:21.953
- Okay.

34:26.187 --> 34:29.187
(crickets chirping)

34:34.612 --> 34:37.005
(gentle jazz music)

34:37.005 --> 34:39.487
(cat meows)

34:39.487 --> 34:41.987
(cat purring)

34:45.120 --> 34:46.290
It smells really good.
- Good.

34:46.290 --> 34:50.847
(wine splashing)
(gentle jazzy music)

34:50.847 --> 34:53.418
This is good, where'd you get it?

34:53.418 --> 34:55.679
- A while back I interviewed this guy,

34:55.679 --> 34:58.690
a older fella, Mav Berger.

34:58.690 --> 35:00.540
He was an electronics tycoon,

35:00.540 --> 35:01.987
and ever since then we kept in contact

35:01.987 --> 35:04.980
and he sends me a case
of wine now and again.

35:04.980 --> 35:05.920
- No bribe.

35:05.920 --> 35:06.753
- Ha.

35:06.753 --> 35:07.586
- I'm joking.

35:08.620 --> 35:10.243
I sure do like a fine wine.

35:11.557 --> 35:12.390
(Detective Santoro chuckles)

35:12.390 --> 35:15.670
My mother used to cook the best pasta.

35:15.670 --> 35:17.460
She used to get this amazing Chianti too,

35:17.460 --> 35:19.590
from the local grocer, Mr. Vera.

35:19.590 --> 35:21.322
It was bottled in Naples.

35:21.322 --> 35:22.830
- Oh, is that where
you're originally from?

35:22.830 --> 35:23.700
- My mom was Greek

35:23.700 --> 35:25.460
and my father's second generation Italian,

35:25.460 --> 35:28.421
so I guess I'm one up on
the culinary upbringing.

35:28.421 --> 35:30.153
- Do you always cook in your jacket?

35:30.153 --> 35:33.360
- I do, I shower and sleep in it as well.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.263
I also cut the grass in it, too.

35:37.198 --> 35:38.960
(Detective Santoro laughs)

35:38.960 --> 35:40.760
I think I pulled it off this time.

35:40.760 --> 35:41.663
Like really.

35:41.663 --> 35:44.663
(gentle jazz music)

35:45.693 --> 35:48.820
- No, no, no, no, no, not
while I'm tipsy, Mister.

35:48.820 --> 35:51.377
- Oh, you're more tight lipped
than Woodward and Bernstein.

35:51.377 --> 35:52.780
Tough girl you are.

35:52.780 --> 35:54.590
- Well, it's like the
oath of a journalist.

35:54.590 --> 35:56.783
You've gotta protect your
sources to the very end.

35:56.783 --> 35:58.418
- What if your child were in danger?

35:58.418 --> 36:00.170
- I don't have a child, I have cats.

36:00.170 --> 36:03.173
- Hm, what if your job were in peril?

36:04.040 --> 36:05.360
- I would take my money and I would

36:05.360 --> 36:07.450
go to an island somewhere for awhile.

36:07.450 --> 36:08.283
- Well.

36:11.070 --> 36:13.970
- Hey, what are you lookin'
for there, Detective?

36:13.970 --> 36:14.810
- I'm just curious where

36:14.810 --> 36:17.350
such award winning information comes from.

36:17.350 --> 36:18.610
- Hm.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.660
Well, what can I say?

36:20.610 --> 36:22.063
People just trust me.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.500
- Hey, does that thing work?

36:27.350 --> 36:28.230
- You like popcorn?

36:28.230 --> 36:29.980
- Yeah, I sure do.

36:29.980 --> 36:30.813
- Well it works.

36:30.813 --> 36:32.182
Shall we?
- Yeah.

36:32.182 --> 36:37.176
(eerie music)
(crickets chirping)

36:37.176 --> 36:42.176
(popcorn popping)
(gentle jazz music)

36:47.144 --> 36:48.570
(fists thudding)

36:48.570 --> 36:50.358
- [Narrator] In the year 1730,

36:50.358 --> 36:51.729
during the reign of the Emperor-

36:51.729 --> 36:53.294
(flying guillotine thudding)

36:53.294 --> 36:56.664
one of the early emperors
of the Manchu Qing dynasty,

36:56.664 --> 36:59.351
many whome for which were
recruited by the Emperor

36:59.351 --> 37:03.032
and were taught use that fearsome weapon,

37:03.032 --> 37:05.455
the flying guillotine.

37:05.455 --> 37:07.468
The purpose of this was to suppress

37:07.468 --> 37:10.566
and cure the borders of
the former Ming dynasty,

37:10.566 --> 37:14.850
and many of neighbors
fell from the new weapon.

37:14.850 --> 37:17.277
Those who escaped went into hiding.

37:17.277 --> 37:20.840
It was to seek these remaining
rebels out and kill them,

37:20.840 --> 37:22.980
that the governments and the noted masters

37:22.980 --> 37:26.018
of flying guillotine Fung Sheng Wu Chi.

37:26.018 --> 37:28.685
(gentle music)

37:39.256 --> 37:42.756
- So, is this what you call inconspicuous?

37:44.470 --> 37:46.626
- I like the peace here.

37:46.626 --> 37:48.563
- I like the dark noir.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.263
Factory was dark.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.640
What makes you so sure
we're not being watched?

37:54.640 --> 37:56.943
- Look around, there's nobody ever here.

37:58.037 --> 37:58.870
- Oh yeah?

38:00.208 --> 38:01.690
Help!

38:01.690 --> 38:02.523
Help!

38:05.460 --> 38:06.410
Okay, you're right.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.533
- Okay.

38:08.533 --> 38:10.410
So, tell me a little bit
more about the murders

38:10.410 --> 38:12.440
and those innocent girls dying.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.610
- Why jump the gun?

38:13.610 --> 38:17.490
- Well, because I'm tired and
I'm hungry and quite frankly,

38:17.490 --> 38:18.880
I've given you enough money by now

38:18.880 --> 38:21.420
to not have to meet you
in person on the daily.

38:21.420 --> 38:22.820
- They weren't so innocent.

38:22.820 --> 38:25.410
There were whistle
blowers deeply involved,

38:25.410 --> 38:26.599
more than you think.

38:26.599 --> 38:30.680
Tina Rockford, she had her
hands in a lotta things.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.467
- She was just a young burger flipper.

38:32.467 --> 38:35.070
- (chuckles) Youth, today.

38:35.070 --> 38:38.113
They lead double lives, triple lives.

38:39.270 --> 38:41.340
And that burger flipping,

38:41.340 --> 38:42.370
it was just a guise so that

38:42.370 --> 38:44.150
you wouldn't realize what she was.

38:44.150 --> 38:45.230
- Meaning what?

38:45.230 --> 38:47.890
- Meaning a little intel collector.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.000
Smart little cookie.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.377
She even had her own pimp.

38:50.377 --> 38:52.894
(eerie music)

38:52.894 --> 38:54.344
- This place is kinda creepy.

38:55.270 --> 38:56.103
I mean, couldn't we have just met

38:56.103 --> 38:57.373
at a coffee shop or something?

38:59.200 --> 39:01.320
- Doesn't really fit in with my work,

39:01.320 --> 39:04.743
especially with the nature
of our business here.

39:06.151 --> 39:08.403
Are you sure you're ready to take this on?

39:10.082 --> 39:11.802
- I mean, how hard could it be?

39:11.802 --> 39:14.373
I need the cash and you need the info,

39:15.350 --> 39:17.490
seems pretty straight forward to me.

39:17.490 --> 39:19.213
- There are risks involved.

39:20.980 --> 39:22.454
Honestly, you're pretty young

39:22.454 --> 39:24.590
and I was having second thoughts whether

39:24.590 --> 39:26.412
to bring you into this world but-

39:26.412 --> 39:28.280
- I know I look innocent,

39:28.280 --> 39:31.303
but really I have more life
experience than you think.

39:32.250 --> 39:33.927
I mean, plus, if anything,

39:33.927 --> 39:36.141
if I might be able to help us out,

39:36.141 --> 39:38.532
people never suspect the young girls.

39:38.532 --> 39:39.860
(Gretchen chuckles)

39:39.860 --> 39:41.510
- I like the way you're thinking.

39:42.408 --> 39:45.617
Maybe you are suited for
this sort of thing after all.

39:51.064 --> 39:52.314
It's all there.

39:54.621 --> 39:56.164
- Okay.

39:56.164 --> 39:58.160
- [Jennifer] Hm.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.850
- Apparently, she was in high demand.

40:00.850 --> 40:03.810
Pimp Johnny was convinced
she had connections high up

40:03.810 --> 40:05.030
in the food chain.

40:05.030 --> 40:06.400
- It's not like you're any cleaner.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.000
I know how you get your intel.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.160
Shady shit for sure.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.810
- Tell me where it shines in this world.

40:12.810 --> 40:13.643
Look at you.

40:13.643 --> 40:14.476
What do you do?

40:14.476 --> 40:16.580
You report on the dirt?

40:16.580 --> 40:17.540
- Yeah, but I get to go home

40:17.540 --> 40:19.640
and take a shower at the end of the night.

40:20.760 --> 40:22.223
Okay, just name your price.

40:23.750 --> 40:26.720
- The dossier you have on Victor Jensen,

40:26.720 --> 40:29.200
the CEO of Precise Industries.

40:29.200 --> 40:33.050
- But that guy is just a
small time entrepreneur dude.

40:33.050 --> 40:33.883
- Right.

40:33.883 --> 40:35.608
Okay, so he doesn't mean anything to you.

40:35.608 --> 40:38.230
No harm, no foul, right?

40:38.230 --> 40:40.406
You hand it over to me and I'll hand

40:40.406 --> 40:44.081
over information to you
that is so fantastic,

40:44.081 --> 40:45.833
you'll cream your jeans.

40:47.420 --> 40:51.733
Hint hint, it's not just
about the Rigby chain.

40:53.650 --> 40:55.680
It's about the Chinese.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.720
- Wait, and the girls?

40:57.720 --> 40:58.553
- Uh huh.

41:00.150 --> 41:02.033
- Wait, you're gonna extort Jensen.

41:02.900 --> 41:03.733
Fuckin' I knew it.

41:03.733 --> 41:04.566
(Jennifer sighs)

41:04.566 --> 41:06.320
Let's not get too chummy, now.

41:06.320 --> 41:10.170
- We've been chummy for a
good part of five years now.

41:10.170 --> 41:13.350
We've been in bed together
fucking this whole time.

41:13.350 --> 41:14.383
You just never knew.

41:16.235 --> 41:17.068
Hm.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.470
See you tomorrow.

41:19.470 --> 41:20.303
Dossier.

41:22.050 --> 41:23.943
Intel disc for you.

41:24.804 --> 41:25.637
Toodlaloo.

41:35.090 --> 41:39.210
- You people are responsible for this.

41:39.210 --> 41:42.170
My daughter, my beautiful, sweet daughter.

41:42.170 --> 41:43.003
She's gone.

41:44.010 --> 41:45.560
She's gone!

41:45.560 --> 41:47.300
- I'm sorry for your loss, Sandra.

41:47.300 --> 41:49.340
Your daughter was a very special girl,

41:49.340 --> 41:51.322
but we're gonna do everything
we can to make this right.

41:51.322 --> 41:53.249
Now, is there anything
in her last few days

41:53.249 --> 41:57.573
that could help us piece
together this tragedy?

41:58.440 --> 42:00.160
- Nothing's gonna help.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.973
My baby's gone for good.

42:03.060 --> 42:06.210
She had her whole life ahead of her

42:07.390 --> 42:10.453
and gone in the blink of an eye.

42:11.930 --> 42:16.530
- Sandra, I know this is really difficult

42:16.530 --> 42:19.097
and I can't even imagine the
pain you're in right now,

42:19.097 --> 42:20.580
and I know she would want us to catch

42:20.580 --> 42:22.530
whoever did this crazy, horrible crime.

42:23.380 --> 42:24.213
- Did she mention anything

42:24.213 --> 42:26.313
that will help us bring this fucker down?

42:28.520 --> 42:30.980
- Nothing too outta the ordinary.

42:30.980 --> 42:32.893
Normal teenage stuff.

42:33.800 --> 42:36.670
She had been a little
sketched out about her job.

42:36.670 --> 42:39.030
So, she was looking for something else.

42:39.030 --> 42:42.550
- Did she mention anything else
about her work environment?

42:42.550 --> 42:46.234
- She said management was under stress.

42:46.234 --> 42:49.390
Also, she found some packages

42:49.390 --> 42:54.257
that were out of place
and a strange shipment

42:54.257 --> 42:57.793
of sorts that made her uncomfortable.

42:58.805 --> 43:03.805
(eerie music)
(packaging rustling)

43:22.230 --> 43:23.103
- Did she mention anything about

43:23.103 --> 43:24.258
what might've been in them?

43:24.258 --> 43:25.730
- I really don't think that's
really important right now.

43:25.730 --> 43:27.507
I mean, did she mention any names

43:27.507 --> 43:30.280
or like a description of anyone that maybe

43:30.280 --> 43:32.370
was at Rigby's that may
have seemed out of place?

43:32.370 --> 43:34.550
- No, nothing.

43:34.550 --> 43:37.533
All I know is innocent girls are dying.

43:38.460 --> 43:43.010
My little girl is gone, Detective.

43:43.010 --> 43:44.043
I think I need some air.

43:44.043 --> 43:46.423
- We're gonna do everything
we can to get this killer.

43:46.423 --> 43:47.256
Okay?

43:47.256 --> 43:48.720
Thank you for coming in and
answering our questions.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.150
Here's my card.

43:50.150 --> 43:53.229
Please, if you need anything,
call me on my direct line.

43:53.229 --> 43:54.062
- Yeah.

43:54.062 --> 43:56.587
(eerie music)

43:56.587 --> 43:58.640
- Hey, what the fuck was that all about?

43:58.640 --> 44:00.460
You totally stonewalled
me about those boxes.

44:00.460 --> 44:02.120
We coulda used some
information about those.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.280
- Oh no, I was just tryin' to
keep us on track and any way,

44:04.280 --> 44:06.410
these interrogations they're short anyway.

44:06.410 --> 44:08.240
We need proper facts.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.010
I apologize for that.

44:10.010 --> 44:12.530
Can I buy you a drink and make up for it?

44:12.530 --> 44:14.268
- No, I'm gonna stay in tonight.

44:14.268 --> 44:15.246
I have a lot of work to do.

44:15.246 --> 44:17.746
(eerie music)

44:24.083 --> 44:25.550
- Hey, Billy Boy.

44:25.550 --> 44:27.596
- Hey Jennifer, what's up?

44:27.596 --> 44:29.110
- What a fucking day.

44:29.110 --> 44:29.952
- Oh yeah?

44:29.952 --> 44:30.963
- Yeah.
- Why?

44:32.382 --> 44:33.215
- No, no.

44:33.215 --> 44:34.750
You ever feel like you're just stuck?

44:34.750 --> 44:35.583
I don't know.

44:35.583 --> 44:37.160
I just, I've gone down every avenue

44:37.160 --> 44:38.260
with the story I'm working on

44:38.260 --> 44:40.850
and nothing seems to be clicking.

44:40.850 --> 44:42.268
Maybe I'm just drained.

44:42.268 --> 44:45.070
- Mm, well, when that happens,

44:45.070 --> 44:47.580
I usually just step away from my desk

44:47.580 --> 44:49.238
when I feel overwhelmed.

44:49.238 --> 44:51.172
I definitely know what
you're going through though,

44:51.172 --> 44:53.173
with all the deadlines and everything.

44:54.451 --> 44:55.713
- I haven't been here that long

44:55.713 --> 44:59.592
and it feels like boss man
just keeps dumping shit on me.

44:59.592 --> 45:04.030
Like more and more and more,
deadline, deadline, deadline.

45:04.030 --> 45:06.190
- Well, you know how he is.

45:06.190 --> 45:08.470
He's gonna work ya around the clock.

45:08.470 --> 45:09.603
That's his MO.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.830
He's not afraid to do it either,

45:12.830 --> 45:15.390
and you're a very highly skilled person,

45:15.390 --> 45:17.140
which is why you're here after all.

45:18.870 --> 45:21.770
- I guess I still have
some adjusting to do.

45:21.770 --> 45:24.195
I'm not used to being so
tethered to something.

45:24.195 --> 45:25.669
- Why don't you let me know exactly

45:25.669 --> 45:27.893
what you're hoping to find.

45:27.893 --> 45:30.340
Scribble down some names
for me and I'll see

45:30.340 --> 45:32.456
what I can do to dig up some information.

45:32.456 --> 45:33.289
- Really?

45:33.289 --> 45:36.830
- Yeah, but definitely
let's keep it under wraps.

45:36.830 --> 45:39.006
- Well, I really appreciate that Billy.

Shut up.

46:34.966 --> 46:39.220
Okay, where are you, Jennifer?

46:39.220 --> 46:41.270
Jennifer, Jennifer, don't let me down.

47:15.355 --> 47:16.188

47:16.188 --> 47:17.308
- (chuckles) Startled me.

47:17.308 --> 47:18.280
- What you got for me?

47:18.280 --> 47:21.740
- Well, not much, but I did find this out

47:21.740 --> 47:23.220
that you might find interesting.

47:23.220 --> 47:25.664
Tina Rockford, it turns out has

47:25.664 --> 47:28.060
an alias named Madeline Thompson.

47:28.060 --> 47:29.880
At least that's what her
social media profiles

47:29.880 --> 47:32.344
and some of her online accounts suggest.

47:32.344 --> 47:35.270
Meanwhile, I also found this out,

47:35.270 --> 47:36.884
that recently she has taken a number

47:36.884 --> 47:39.390
of exotic trips around the world

47:39.390 --> 47:42.962
to like Bali and Dubai, Honolulu.

47:42.962 --> 47:45.200
The list goes on and on.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.560
- Must be nice.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.450
Think she got a sugar daddy?

47:48.450 --> 47:49.283
- Yeah.

47:49.283 --> 47:50.660
And the question is one or two?

47:51.720 --> 47:52.553
- And?

47:52.553 --> 47:54.810
- Well, I did a little more research

47:54.810 --> 47:56.079
and this will surprise you.

47:56.079 --> 48:00.410
It turns out that she has a gentlemen,

48:00.410 --> 48:02.420
riddle man keeps coming up as part

48:02.420 --> 48:04.447
of her life linking the
two of them together

48:04.447 --> 48:08.440
and apparently he is this mogul

48:08.440 --> 48:10.780
of Rigby Food Distribution empire

48:10.780 --> 48:13.848
and that's her exotic ticket outta here,

48:13.848 --> 48:16.551
and his name is Roger Neilson.

48:16.551 --> 48:19.100
- Oh my God, you're the best.

48:19.100 --> 48:20.010
Thank you so much.

48:20.010 --> 48:20.843
- Oh, you're welcome.

48:20.843 --> 48:22.170
- You mean the world to me.

48:22.170 --> 48:24.300
I can't believe all the work
you're putting into this.

48:24.300 --> 48:25.133
I have a surprise for you.

48:25.133 --> 48:26.630
Are you ready?

48:26.630 --> 48:28.662
WrestleMania tickets, all yours.

48:28.662 --> 48:31.320
- Oh, you don't have to
tempt me with a good time.

48:31.320 --> 48:32.361
- You're the best, thank you.

48:32.361 --> 48:33.194

49:43.208 --> 49:46.291
(heartbeat pounding)

49:48.797 --> 49:50.080
- How are you feelin', sweetheart?

49:50.080 --> 49:51.449
Are you hungry?

49:51.449 --> 49:52.693
- I've been better.

49:53.910 --> 49:55.450
- Here's some tea, maybe?

49:55.450 --> 49:56.940
It's comforting.

49:56.940 --> 49:59.250
I'll get you some pain meds
to help with the pain, okay?

49:59.250 --> 50:01.242
- Yeah, thank you.

50:01.242 --> 50:02.400
Thanks.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.233
- Oh, okay.

50:03.233 --> 50:05.203
I'll leave you two to visit for a few.

50:06.210 --> 50:08.098
Make sure you try to eat
somethin', okay, hon?

50:08.098 --> 50:08.931
- Okay.

50:10.181 --> 50:12.573
- [Detective Santoro] Jennifer,
I came as soon as I could.

50:13.420 --> 50:14.531
- Thanks.

50:14.531 --> 50:16.890
You really didn't have
to come all this way.

50:16.890 --> 50:17.723
- Are you kidding me?

50:17.723 --> 50:18.623
Of course I did.

50:20.430 --> 50:21.610
- What's that?

50:21.610 --> 50:23.610
- I brought you some food.

50:23.610 --> 50:25.810
Food in these places
can be pretty terrible.

50:26.716 --> 50:27.940
- Thanks.

50:27.940 --> 50:28.780
You really know how to cheer a girl up.

50:28.780 --> 50:30.453
- It's the least I could do.

50:34.270 --> 50:36.017
Jennifer, do you remember
what happened to you?

50:36.017 --> 50:37.433
- Of course I remember.

50:37.433 --> 50:40.600
I mean, I was attacked
by some fucking goon.

50:40.600 --> 50:41.780
- I know this is hard,

50:41.780 --> 50:43.444
but do you remember what he looked like?

50:43.444 --> 50:45.380
- Look, I know it's your job and all,

50:45.380 --> 50:48.070
but I really don't feel like
being interrogated right now.

50:48.070 --> 50:50.170
You know, I've already given my statement

50:50.170 --> 50:52.440
to somebody else this morning, anyways.

50:52.440 --> 50:53.820
- You gave a statement already?

50:53.820 --> 50:54.960
To who?

50:54.960 --> 50:56.030
- Yeah, they didn't waste any time.

50:56.030 --> 50:57.680
It was somebody from your office.

50:59.020 --> 51:00.700
I'm pretty sure my boss was all over him

51:00.700 --> 51:02.340
to get this shit sorted out.

51:02.340 --> 51:03.757
And I was so loopy when I came in here

51:03.757 --> 51:06.133
that it just all seemed like a blur.

51:07.247 --> 51:08.080
- Hm.

51:09.041 --> 51:10.030
(Jennifer sighs)

51:10.030 --> 51:11.013
- Are you okay?

51:11.013 --> 51:11.846
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

51:11.846 --> 51:14.917
It's just, I'm still upset about

51:14.917 --> 51:19.180
this whole situation
and look, I'm so sorry.

51:19.180 --> 51:20.060
And we're gonna do everything we can

51:20.060 --> 51:21.603
to get this son of a bitch.

51:22.730 --> 51:25.090
- Hey, don't you worry.

51:25.090 --> 51:26.580
I'm gonna be fine.

51:26.580 --> 51:30.149
And I put up a good fight, so
he just caught me off guard.

51:30.149 --> 51:31.313
It'll all work out.

51:38.387 --> 51:39.720
What's that for?

51:39.720 --> 51:40.900
- Look, I really think you should

51:40.900 --> 51:42.605
have this on you at all times.

51:42.605 --> 51:43.700
- I don't really think that's a good idea.

51:43.700 --> 51:46.510
- Look, I'm gonna do everything I can

51:46.510 --> 51:49.680
in my power to protect
you, but I'm still worried.

51:49.680 --> 51:51.240
Okay?

51:51.240 --> 51:54.340
I mean this situation's
gotten all outta hand.

51:54.340 --> 51:56.811
I wanna make sure you're
okay at all times.

51:56.811 --> 51:59.478
(gentle music)

52:08.460 --> 52:10.925
I care about you so much, Jennifer.

52:10.925 --> 52:13.508
(gentle music)

52:19.870 --> 52:22.370
(eerie music)

52:25.202 --> 52:26.820
- Where's my money.

52:26.820 --> 52:28.330
- [Man] Shut the fuck up.

52:28.330 --> 52:33.330
(eerie music)
(man choking)

52:38.899 --> 52:41.897
(man laughing faintly)

52:41.897 --> 52:44.035
(eerie music)

52:44.035 --> 52:44.904
- [Rick] Please!

52:44.904 --> 52:46.304
- No.

52:46.304 --> 52:47.137
- [Rick] Please!

52:47.137 --> 52:47.970
- No.

52:47.970 --> 52:48.880
- It's important!

52:48.880 --> 52:49.713
- [Jennifer] No!

52:49.713 --> 52:50.833
- Please, I'm begging you.

52:50.833 --> 52:52.209
I just need to talk.

52:52.209 --> 52:56.357
Just for a minute (gasping).

52:56.357 --> 52:58.880
- You don't give up easily do you?

52:58.880 --> 52:59.780
- Okay.

52:59.780 --> 53:00.940
Have a look.

53:00.940 --> 53:02.260
See, these are the girls.

53:02.260 --> 53:03.093
(shutter clicking)

53:03.093 --> 53:04.883
They all worked for Rigby.

53:06.630 --> 53:08.343
- Wait, go back.

53:09.210 --> 53:10.549
What the hell is that?

53:10.549 --> 53:11.490
(shutter clicking)

53:11.490 --> 53:12.500
- Yo, creep!
- Oh no, no, no, no.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.333
It's not what you think.

53:13.333 --> 53:14.166
No, no, no.

53:14.166 --> 53:15.038
Look, look.

53:15.038 --> 53:16.515
(shutter clicking)
(air whooshing)

53:16.515 --> 53:19.650
(Rick panting)

53:19.650 --> 53:22.423
See, I think you might be in grave danger.

53:24.500 --> 53:26.468
- How long have been observing me?

53:26.468 --> 53:31.468
(Rick panting)
(eerie music)

53:38.762 --> 53:39.975
(phone vibrating)

53:39.975 --> 53:40.808
Oh.

53:43.960 --> 53:44.793
Hey, Detective.

53:44.793 --> 53:45.670
- [Detective Santoro] I wanted to extend

53:45.670 --> 53:47.410
the offer to buy you a drink.

53:47.410 --> 53:50.100
- Look, I already told you I
had so much to catch up on.

53:50.100 --> 53:52.220
My boss is all over me right now.

53:52.220 --> 53:54.307
Especially after my little hospital stay.

53:54.307 --> 53:55.576
- [Detective Santoro] Still?

53:55.576 --> 53:57.772
- Mm hm, behind, behind.

53:57.772 --> 54:01.163
- [Detective Santoro]
I'm being very polite.

54:01.163 --> 54:02.737
- I mean, I could use a drink.

54:02.737 --> 54:03.840
- [Detective Santoro]
You wouldn't regret it,

54:03.840 --> 54:04.754
Detective's promise.

54:04.754 --> 54:05.960
(Jennifer smirks)

54:05.960 --> 54:07.290
- Okay, I need like an hour.

54:07.290 --> 54:08.123
- [Detective Santoro] Last Call,

54:08.123 --> 54:09.223
it's a bar near year office.

54:09.223 --> 54:11.477
- All right, I'll see you there.

54:14.183 --> 54:15.264
Okay.

54:15.264 --> 54:18.960
(gentle jazzy music)

54:18.960 --> 54:20.310
Hm.

54:20.310 --> 54:21.830
Hey, thanks for being so persistent.

54:21.830 --> 54:24.220
I think I really needed
this drink after all.

54:24.220 --> 54:25.620
- It's great to see you again.

54:25.620 --> 54:27.300
- Yeah, it's been a really crazy week.

54:27.300 --> 54:28.762
I mean my boss is goin' kinda nuts

54:28.762 --> 54:31.452
and things are just gettin' really weird.

54:31.452 --> 54:33.214
- It's always good to get out.

54:33.214 --> 54:34.047
- True.

54:34.047 --> 54:35.440
Cheers.
(glasses clinking)

54:35.440 --> 54:36.490
Is that beer any good?

54:36.490 --> 54:37.880
- It's an IPA.

54:37.880 --> 54:38.713
You know what's funny?

54:38.713 --> 54:39.870
That they taste different

54:39.870 --> 54:41.730
in the winter time compared to summer.

54:41.730 --> 54:43.400
- Huh.
- And I don't know why.

54:43.400 --> 54:44.410
- Maybe it's just the hops

54:44.410 --> 54:45.243
and how they-
- Yeah.

54:45.243 --> 54:46.610
- Hey Captain Catfish,

54:46.610 --> 54:48.945
you lose your phone in a bowl of rice?

54:48.945 --> 54:51.170
- I think you got the wrong guy.

54:51.170 --> 54:53.910
- This note is legal tender for all debts,

54:53.910 --> 54:55.660
public and private.
(heartbeat pounding)

54:55.660 --> 54:59.018
Ours is private and you owe
me at least 500 more of these.

54:59.018 --> 55:01.750
(dramatic music)

55:01.750 --> 55:02.603
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:02.603 --> 55:03.630
Hey, hey, hey!

55:03.630 --> 55:06.878
(foot thudding)
(dramatic music)

55:06.878 --> 55:09.201
- You showed off to the lady-
- Shut the fuck up!

55:09.201 --> 55:10.763
- [Man] I was only-

55:10.763 --> 55:12.159
- Shut the God damn fuck up!

55:12.159 --> 55:14.890
(dramatic music)

55:14.890 --> 55:16.020
- [Man] If you were any real cop

55:16.020 --> 55:17.720
you'd arrest yourself for larceny.

55:20.331 --> 55:22.157
- What is going on?

55:22.157 --> 55:24.990
- Oh, he's just some fucking crack head.

55:24.990 --> 55:25.823
That guy's crazy.

55:25.823 --> 55:27.150
I've taken him before.

55:27.150 --> 55:29.590
I'll just call some
backup to clean him up.

55:29.590 --> 55:30.910
He's not gonna be a problem anymore.

55:30.910 --> 55:31.743
- Oh my God.

55:31.743 --> 55:34.193
This week has just been
getting so fucking weird.

55:36.070 --> 55:37.480
- It's okay, everything's all right.

55:37.480 --> 55:40.563
(gentle jazzy music)

55:42.106 --> 55:44.867
(eerie music)

55:44.867 --> 55:49.849
(keyboard keys clacking)
(eerie music)

55:49.849 --> 55:52.539
- [Man] Billy, you old sly.

55:52.539 --> 55:55.346
Come out and play with me and we'll

55:55.346 --> 55:58.636
be friends forevermore.
- Hey, I recognize you.

55:58.636 --> 56:03.636
(Billy screaming)
(dramatic music)

56:07.622 --> 56:10.622
(crickets chirping)

56:18.957 --> 56:19.790
- [Man] Jennifer?

56:19.790 --> 56:24.790
(wolf howling)
(pensive music)

56:37.979 --> 56:40.414
(gentle music)

56:40.414 --> 56:42.310
- Let me get one more.

56:42.310 --> 56:44.553
- [Bartender] I'm afraid
we're wrappin' it up, buddy.

56:45.420 --> 56:46.320
Time to get goin'.

56:47.270 --> 56:48.963
- Just one more and then I'm out of here.

56:48.963 --> 56:50.490
- [Bartender] I can't serve you anything

56:50.490 --> 56:52.040
but water at this point.

56:52.040 --> 56:54.483
- Bullshit, that's fuckin' bullshit.

56:57.340 --> 57:00.003
- [Bartender] All right, time to go.

57:00.003 --> 57:01.150
- Fuck you, man.

57:01.150 --> 57:02.155
Fuck you.

57:02.155 --> 57:05.572
(man vocalizing faintly)

57:09.064 --> 57:11.231
This sucks, how you doin'?

57:14.527 --> 57:16.249
That guy is somethin'.

57:16.249 --> 57:19.582
All I wanted was one more fuckin' drink.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.887
I'm never goin' back to
that shit hole again.

57:22.887 --> 57:26.304
(man vocalizing faintly)

57:27.181 --> 57:28.848
Where the hell am I?

57:33.084 --> 57:34.600
- [Man] Torsten?

57:34.600 --> 57:36.271
- [Torsten] Who said that?

57:36.271 --> 57:37.543
The owner?

57:37.543 --> 57:39.225
- [Man] Torsten?

57:39.225 --> 57:41.602
You bloody loser.
- Who the fuck are you?

57:41.602 --> 57:45.955
(Torsten choking)
(eerie music)

57:45.955 --> 57:48.431
(heartbeat pounding)

57:48.431 --> 57:52.349
(man laughing faintly)

57:52.349 --> 57:55.766
(man vocalizing faintly)

57:58.642 --> 58:03.394
(shutter clicking)
(pensive music)

58:03.394 --> 58:08.394
(dramatic music)
(Rick choking)

58:17.960 --> 58:18.793
- Dickhead.

58:18.793 --> 58:21.406
(pensive music)

58:27.233 --> 58:30.983
(Detective Santoro knocking)

58:34.816 --> 58:35.898
- [Jennifer] Joey.

58:35.898 --> 58:37.663
Oh my God, what happened?

58:39.378 --> 58:40.943
Oh my God, are you okay?

58:40.943 --> 58:41.776
- Yeah.

58:44.190 --> 58:45.023
- Oh, shit.

58:46.710 --> 58:47.630
You look horrible.

58:47.630 --> 58:48.723
- I don't know.

58:48.723 --> 58:51.400
I was driving headed to your house.

58:51.400 --> 58:53.181
I had to stop and get gas

58:53.181 --> 58:54.323
and I don't know what hit me.

58:54.323 --> 58:55.828
I heard this crash.

58:55.828 --> 58:57.450
I don't remember what happened,

58:57.450 --> 58:59.680
but the bastard took my wallet.

58:59.680 --> 59:03.460
- Did you call anybody that the cops...

59:03.460 --> 59:04.630
- That's funny.

59:04.630 --> 59:06.480
That's why I love you, Jennifer.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.480
That's why (laughs).

59:08.520 --> 59:10.220
You're not nutty, you're Jennifer.

59:12.140 --> 59:13.593
- You're nutty, relax.

59:14.800 --> 59:18.300
♪ I'm wild after Jennifer ♪

59:19.210 --> 59:22.104

59:36.136 --> 59:37.690
- I know.

59:37.690 --> 59:38.523
- What happened?

59:38.523 --> 59:40.035
What were you doing out so late?

59:40.035 --> 59:41.120
I mean, it's like
- I know, I just-

59:41.120 --> 59:41.953

59:41.953 --> 59:45.154

You're so wonderful and neat
and wholesome (chuckles).

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:20.311
- Listen, just relax, okay?

01:00:20.311 --> 01:00:21.144
Be right back.

01:00:21.144 --> 01:00:22.141
Get some rest.
- Okay.

01:00:22.141 --> 01:00:23.695
All right.

01:00:23.695 --> 01:00:28.695
Jennifer (chuckles), you're
so good and wholesome.

01:00:29.881 --> 01:00:32.298
(Joey sighs)

01:00:38.994 --> 01:00:41.494
(eerie music)

01:00:49.828 --> 01:00:54.828
(Joey humming)
(eerie music)

01:01:02.783 --> 01:01:03.708
To us.

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:05.415
(glasses clinking)

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:09.110
And me being your bodyguard forever.

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:09.943
- Oh yeah?

01:01:09.943 --> 01:01:10.776
- Yeah.

01:01:10.776 --> 01:01:13.080
- I think you hit your head
pretty hard or somethin'.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.351
- Yeah, I did (chuckles).

01:01:17.351 --> 01:01:22.351
Well, I was driving around
some vineyards earlier

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:26.560
and I was thinking maybe someday

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.560
we could live on one and
maybe breed the perfect grape.

01:01:32.594 --> 01:01:33.927
- [Jennifer] Hm.

01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:36.927
(Joey chuckles)

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:39.510
- Have some cats.

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:41.284
Okay, it's okay.

01:01:41.284 --> 01:01:43.733
Can't leave here right now.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.066
Okay, it's okay.

01:01:46.343 --> 01:01:48.449
Have some conventions.

01:01:48.449 --> 01:01:49.328
- You're silly.

01:01:49.328 --> 01:01:50.712
(Joey chuckles)

01:01:50.712 --> 01:01:51.545
Almost.

01:01:53.036 --> 01:01:57.364
I tell ya, those guys on the
force, they're all corrupt.

01:01:57.364 --> 01:01:58.779
And those politicians,

01:01:58.779 --> 01:02:01.593
they screw over small
businesses, corporations.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.024
They're making us addicts.

01:02:03.024 --> 01:02:05.783
(eerie music)

01:02:05.783 --> 01:02:06.996
It's all right.

01:02:06.996 --> 01:02:09.517
Everything will happen soon.

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:10.820
Everything will be better soon.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.895
Soon, this will all happen

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:15.090
and we'll be free at last.

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:17.398
What are you saying?
- I'm hot.

01:02:17.398 --> 01:02:19.565
- I can't hear you.
- Yeah.

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:24.046
- There we go, let's go over here.

01:02:24.046 --> 01:02:27.253
We're gonna walk there aren't we?

01:02:27.253 --> 01:02:28.086
Come here.

01:02:28.937 --> 01:02:30.687
You stay right there.

01:02:32.745 --> 01:02:33.578
Stay right there.

01:02:33.578 --> 01:02:36.078
(eerie music)

01:02:36.957 --> 01:02:40.104
(Joey chuckles)

01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:45.104
(heartbeat pounding)
(eerie music)

01:02:47.369 --> 01:02:52.369
(Joey humming)
(eerie music)

01:03:01.508 --> 01:03:03.980
(Joey chuckles)

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.003
You blacked out.

01:03:06.745 --> 01:03:08.600
You should watch what you're drinking.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.067
You never know where
drink might be spiked.

01:03:12.067 --> 01:03:14.123
- (sobs) Joey.

01:03:16.278 --> 01:03:17.943
What the fuck?

01:03:17.943 --> 01:03:20.514
- [Joey] Yeah (chuckles).

01:03:20.514 --> 01:03:23.181
(Jennifer sobs)

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.533
- Why?

01:03:25.533 --> 01:03:26.369
(Joey chuckles)

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:29.633
- Oh, maybe you thought
I was someone I'm not.

01:03:31.092 --> 01:03:31.925
Hm?

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.160
(Jennifer screams)

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.163
Stop your crying.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.764
We're in love.

01:03:38.764 --> 01:03:41.270
Listen, listen.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.080
(cat hissing)

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.203
Fuck off, pussy.

01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:48.035
(air whooshing)

01:03:48.035 --> 01:03:50.499
Will you marry me, Jenny?

01:03:50.499 --> 01:03:51.999
Will you marry me?

01:03:53.493 --> 01:03:55.382
Tick, tick, tick.

01:03:55.382 --> 01:03:56.215
(air whooshing)

01:03:56.215 --> 01:03:57.297
Will you marry me?

01:03:57.297 --> 01:04:00.580
(Jennifer sobbing)
(pensive music)

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.443
Answer me!

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:03.193
Answer me now!

01:04:06.019 --> 01:04:08.106
- (sobbing) No!

01:04:08.106 --> 01:04:09.637
No!

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:11.044
No, no!

01:04:11.044 --> 01:04:13.544
(eerie music)

01:04:14.781 --> 01:04:19.781
(Jennifer groaning)
(eerie music)

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.940
- Come here, Jennifer.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.589
My parents owned the best cattle company,

01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:33.180
and they made a lotta money until

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:37.581
the middleman and a sale and
they took all their money.

01:04:37.581 --> 01:04:38.414
All their money.

01:04:38.414 --> 01:04:39.270
We had nothing to show for it,

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.760
and my parents, they would teach me

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.820
all the fundamentals of
how to be a good person

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.010
and loving someone, loving anyone,

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.860
and then they screwed us over.

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.103
We had so much money.

01:04:52.247 --> 01:04:56.932
(laughs) Oh now you got
something to say, huh, Jenny?

01:04:56.932 --> 01:04:57.765
No, no.

01:04:57.765 --> 01:04:59.161
I'm not gonna stop.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:04:59.994
I'm having too much fun.

01:04:59.994 --> 01:05:02.494
(eerie music)

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:12.620
And then all of a sudden
the world is changing.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.628
People can clone anything.

01:05:13.628 --> 01:05:16.625
Plants, cattle, even us.

01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:19.240
Jennifer, you're the writer, though.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.247
You can write things.

01:05:21.247 --> 01:05:25.040
- Why?
- Why can't we rely on you?

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.146
We relied on your stories.

01:05:27.146 --> 01:05:32.146
(eerie music)
(heartbeat pounding)

01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:36.020
You let my family down!

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.327
I got one more thing to say to you.

01:05:38.327 --> 01:05:39.954
One more thing to say!

01:05:39.954 --> 01:05:42.561
(eerie music)
(Jennifer screaming)

01:05:42.561 --> 01:05:44.811
This is your last deadline!

01:05:45.666 --> 01:05:47.888
(Jennifer screaming)
(heartbeat pounding)

01:05:47.888 --> 01:05:52.888
(cat meows)
(dramatic music)

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:03.287
(Joey screams)
(dramatic music)

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.165
- This is the moment I've dreamed of.

01:06:13.165 --> 01:06:13.998
(elbow thuds)

01:06:13.998 --> 01:06:17.316
(eerie music)
(heartbeat pounding)

01:06:17.316 --> 01:06:18.899
- I worked so hard.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:22.138
I'm to gonna screw it in the end.

01:06:22.138 --> 01:06:24.796
- All you did was run a
business (speaking faintly).

01:06:24.796 --> 01:06:25.634
- It's all your fault.

01:06:25.634 --> 01:06:30.096
(dramatic music)
(heartbeat pounding)

01:06:30.096 --> 01:06:35.096
(Jennifer screaming)
(dramatic music)

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:57.541
Hey Jennifer?

01:07:00.126 --> 01:07:02.325
Look at the clock.

01:07:02.325 --> 01:07:04.117
You have one more minute.

01:07:04.117 --> 01:07:06.487
One minute to decide.

01:07:06.487 --> 01:07:10.559
Is it gonna be eternal
love or eternal death?

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.510
Huh?

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:12.562
Answer me.

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:13.395
Answer me.

01:07:14.436 --> 01:07:15.269
Answer me.

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:18.148
Answer me, bitch!

01:07:18.148 --> 01:07:19.877
- Fuck you!

01:07:19.877 --> 01:07:23.710
You never fucking learn do you?

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.854
You did all this for your
selfish fucking needs.

01:07:26.854 --> 01:07:29.240
You piece of shit and your fucking family.

01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:34.485
All I wanna do is go
back to my normal life.

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:36.119
Forget all of this stupid shit.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:38.619
(eerie music)

01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:48.333
(dramatic music)

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:57.721
(heartbeat pounding)

01:08:00.072 --> 01:08:05.072
(shot firing)
(gentle music)

01:08:29.599 --> 01:08:30.432
- Holy shit.

01:08:30.432 --> 01:08:33.015
(gentle music)

01:08:45.435 --> 01:08:48.603
(gentle music builds)

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:09.203
Hi.

01:09:09.203 --> 01:09:10.229
- Hey.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.229
You're lookin' good.

01:09:12.551 --> 01:09:14.252
- Thank you, Miss Sutton.

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.082
- It's Jennifer.

01:09:18.298 --> 01:09:19.372
- Jennifer.

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:21.303
- How are you?

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:24.148
- Good.

01:09:24.148 --> 01:09:27.393
Thank you for helpin' me get the new job.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.649
- Yeah, of course.

01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:30.483
How's it going?

01:09:30.483 --> 01:09:31.433
Are they treating you good?

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:33.649
- [Rick] Yeah.

01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:36.310
Dale, he's a good man.

01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:37.386
- Hm, he is.

01:09:40.317 --> 01:09:43.403
- So, I heard you're leaving?

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.673
- Yeah, it's time to move on.

01:09:48.194 --> 01:09:49.569
- Oh.

01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:51.069
- I really did give it my all,

01:09:52.752 --> 01:09:54.616
and I think maybe the
world is a better place

01:09:54.616 --> 01:09:57.673
because of what we do
sometimes and maybe not.

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:02.706
Sometimes it's just best not to know.

01:10:02.706 --> 01:10:06.170
- Mm, I think it's always better to know.

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:08.320
- You're so naive
sometimes, you know that?

01:10:12.197 --> 01:10:15.300
- So, are you gonna write
a book or something?

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.880
- No, no book.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.400
I think I'm just gonna go and
live my life for a change.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.453
- Dale, he's helping me
to speak more to people,

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:27.453
now that I don't live
behind my camera so much.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.570
- That's good.

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:31.820
I think that's good.

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:32.653
Keep it up.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.313
- Thank you, Miss (chuckles), Jennifer.

01:10:42.928 --> 01:10:44.796
- Is everything okay?

01:10:44.796 --> 01:10:46.630
- I think I need a new belt.

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.814
I've lost some weight.

01:10:48.814 --> 01:10:49.647
(Jennifer chuckles)

01:10:49.647 --> 01:10:50.480
