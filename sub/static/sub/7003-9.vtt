00:08.874 --> 00:10.541
If you're like me,

00:10.542 --> 00:13.678
You've spent time on the floor
after an accident...

00:16.047 --> 00:19.784
...Waiting for the paramedics
to arrive.

00:19.785 --> 00:23.688
It's times like these
a lot of thoughts roll
through your head.

00:23.689 --> 00:27.291
"I wonder
if the bleeding will stop."

00:27.292 --> 00:30.829
"I had no idea electricity
could lift me off the ground
that high."

00:32.598 --> 00:34.365
Or, "from this angle,

00:34.366 --> 00:37.636
That smooth ceiling
could use a little texture."

00:37.637 --> 00:39.671
And how would we do that, al?

00:39.672 --> 00:44.275
Well, tim,
with binford's 6100
acoustic spraying system.

00:44.276 --> 00:45.877
That's right.

00:45.878 --> 00:48.546
With the 6100 system,
even the most inexperienced,
unskilled homeowner

00:48.547 --> 00:50.548
Can do this simple job.

00:50.549 --> 00:53.118
And who better to demonstrate
than you, tim?

00:57.890 --> 00:59.423
For this job,

00:59.424 --> 01:02.661
Al and I suggest binford's
acoustical texture spray.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.328
That's right. It comes
in these ready-to-mix bags.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.431
All you do is add water.

01:07.432 --> 01:11.670
Or, for a creamier texture,
go with the buttermilk.

01:11.671 --> 01:14.739
Obviously you want to follow
the instructions precisely,

01:14.740 --> 01:16.407
Because too much water,

01:16.408 --> 01:19.644
And your mixture
will not adhere
to your ceiling.

01:19.645 --> 01:22.147
Tim, I've already
mixed that.

01:22.148 --> 01:26.217
Yeah... Just needs
a bit more water, al.

01:26.218 --> 01:28.386
I used a measuring cup.

01:28.387 --> 01:32.023
We're not doing laundry,
fella.

01:32.024 --> 01:37.628
I use a measuring system
that never fails me - my eye.

01:37.629 --> 01:40.899
My eye.

01:42.401 --> 01:44.402
Once you've mixed
the compound,

01:44.403 --> 01:46.571
It's ready
to load in the hopper.

01:46.572 --> 01:48.206
Give me a hand, dennis.

01:52.778 --> 01:55.980
Perfecto. All right.

01:55.981 --> 01:57.481
When you get going,

01:57.482 --> 02:00.051
What you do
is use short even strokes,

02:00.052 --> 02:03.421
Keeping the gun
about 2 feet from your ceiling.

02:03.422 --> 02:04.622
<i>(muffled)</i> all right.

02:19.805 --> 02:24.275
And you doubted me.

02:24.276 --> 02:26.277
I stand corrected.

02:26.278 --> 02:29.614
I would be proud
to have a ceiling like this

02:29.615 --> 02:32.150
In my living room.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.691
Who let those pigeons
in here?

03:50.229 --> 03:53.231
What do you think? Should we
put the kids in the middle?

03:56.368 --> 04:00.738
No, ashley,
there's nothing going on
between me and melissa.

04:00.739 --> 04:03.441
I just gave her a taste
of my jell-o.

04:03.442 --> 04:07.445
It's not like we both chewed
the same piece of gum.

04:07.446 --> 04:10.315
Ashley, come on. Hold on.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.650
Randy, I'm on the phone.
Get out.

04:12.651 --> 04:15.019
You get out.
It's my room, too.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.353
I was here first.

04:16.355 --> 04:18.857
Look, I'm just getting
my books.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.291
I'm listening.

04:20.291 --> 04:24.562
I swear,
there's nothing going on
between me and melissa.

04:24.563 --> 04:28.466
<i>(high voice)</i> oh, brad,
get off the phone and kiss me.

04:28.467 --> 04:31.202
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

04:31.203 --> 04:33.738
No, that's not melissa.
It's my stupid brother.

04:35.707 --> 04:37.208
Listen, ashley,

04:37.209 --> 04:40.211
There's nothing going on
between us.

04:40.212 --> 04:41.612
Uh-huh.

04:41.613 --> 04:46.584
Hold me, my hunka hunka
burning love.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.757
Ashley,
I'll see you at school.

04:52.758 --> 04:54.158
All right. Bye.

04:54.159 --> 04:56.394
You're a hunka dead meat!

05:00.632 --> 05:02.367
I'm gonna kill you!

05:02.368 --> 05:05.436
But I thought
you loved me.

05:05.437 --> 05:07.338
Stop, stop, stop!

05:07.339 --> 05:09.740
Guys, stop it.
What's going on?

05:09.741 --> 05:11.809
He keeps bugging me
when I'm on the phone.

05:11.810 --> 05:14.078
<i>(normal voice)</i>
he's on the phone
24 hours a day.

05:14.079 --> 05:16.080
Don't use the phone
so much.

05:16.081 --> 05:19.984
I can't help it
if I'm so popular.

05:19.985 --> 05:23.454
<i>(high voice)</i>
well, I guess that's why
all us girls love you.

05:23.455 --> 05:25.123
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Bradley, bradley!

05:25.124 --> 05:27.225
Come here. Come here.
What?

05:27.226 --> 05:30.295
Take your coat, take your bag,
and you go out that way.

05:32.497 --> 05:34.332
<i>(door slams)</i>

05:34.333 --> 05:37.302
Well, this is what
we're leaving the world.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.636
Face it, honey.

05:38.637 --> 05:41.139
You raised two
very obnoxious
little boys.

05:41.140 --> 05:45.143
What is going on with them?
They've really been going at it
these last couple of weeks.

05:45.144 --> 05:49.914
You're right.
Black eye, bloody nose,
stitches, loose tooth.

05:49.915 --> 05:52.450
Well, we gotta do something
before they kill each other.

05:52.451 --> 05:55.219
Tonight,
after they're asleep,

05:55.220 --> 05:58.589
You and me, puerto rico.

06:02.761 --> 06:04.595
Tim, this is serious.

06:04.596 --> 06:07.298
We've got to find out
what's wrong with them.

06:07.299 --> 06:09.434
All right.
Then we go to puerto rico.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.804
If we wanna solve
this problem,

06:13.805 --> 06:16.540
There's only one thing
to do - separate bedrooms.

06:16.541 --> 06:20.511
We don't have any more bedrooms.
And, no, no, no, no, no, no!

06:20.512 --> 06:22.513
You're not building
any more.

06:22.514 --> 06:25.249
Honey, we've talked
about this before.

06:25.250 --> 06:29.387
Move brad into mark's room,
and then mark into randy's room.

06:29.388 --> 06:33.557
No. No. Ok, brad is older.
He probably should have
his own room.

06:33.558 --> 06:35.726
But we can't make
a decision like that

06:35.727 --> 06:37.728
Without discussing it
with all the boys.

06:37.729 --> 06:39.297
Why discuss it?

06:39.298 --> 06:42.666
The reason we became parents
is so we could tell kids
what to do.

06:42.667 --> 06:45.036
If we can't do that,

06:45.037 --> 06:47.238
We're just the tallest people
living here.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.846
You sound like my father.

06:55.847 --> 06:57.715
All right.

06:59.218 --> 07:01.219
Today, we're gonna show you

07:01.220 --> 07:03.954
How to soundproof
as well as insulate the walls.

07:03.955 --> 07:06.690
Now, there's a variety
of products you can use,
of course.

07:06.691 --> 07:09.693
Acoustic padding,
fiberglass batting,

07:09.694 --> 07:13.231
Or very unattractive flannel.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.766
The easiest way
to install your insulation

07:15.767 --> 07:18.802
Is during construction,
before you've put up
your dry wall.

07:18.803 --> 07:21.639
However, if the dry wall's
already been installed
in your home,

07:21.640 --> 07:23.641
We suggest
the foam injection method.

07:23.642 --> 07:25.776
Heidi, the foam injector,
please.

07:26.978 --> 07:28.479
Here you go, tim.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.214
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

07:30.215 --> 07:32.983
For this method, you're gonna
have to drill some holes.

07:32.984 --> 07:35.119
But first
you wanna find a stud.

07:42.961 --> 07:45.763
I said "stud," not "dud."

07:45.764 --> 07:47.631
<i>(drills)</i>

07:47.632 --> 07:50.134
It's already compressed air
in there.

07:50.135 --> 07:53.137
To make it work,
stick your nozzle in,
and you start insulating.

07:53.138 --> 07:56.140
Mm-hmm. It should dry
in about ten minutes.
That's right, al.

07:56.141 --> 07:58.209
To show some of the advantage
of soundproofing,

07:58.210 --> 08:01.212
The crew and I got here early
and constructed a special room.

08:01.213 --> 08:03.514
Heidi, my room, please.

08:03.515 --> 08:06.317
Now, this room will
not only protect you
from the elements,

08:06.318 --> 08:07.818
Keep you warm,

08:07.819 --> 08:10.821
But it's also
totally soundproof.

08:10.822 --> 08:15.693
Here you go, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

08:15.694 --> 08:17.195
Watch this, al.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.063
Can't hear a word.
It's so good. Watch.

08:19.064 --> 08:23.201
Talking like this.
You walk in. Hi, everybody.
My name's tim "the tool..."

08:44.423 --> 08:46.056

08:49.060 --> 08:52.096
That is truly amazing.
We did not hear a sound.

08:52.097 --> 08:55.099
No. That's how
it was designed.
You gotta try it.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.101
Let yourself go.
It's great. Yeah.

09:00.905 --> 09:04.742
Tim, can you hear me?
<i>(mouths)</i>

09:04.743 --> 09:06.777
You can't hear me?

09:06.778 --> 09:11.549

I should be the host
of this show.

09:11.550 --> 09:15.753
And another thing.
That's a stupid haircut
you have.

09:15.754 --> 09:17.255

right now, brad.
Come on.

10:26.024 --> 10:29.059
Why are you keeping him
out of the room?
He keeps bugging me.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.562
You're full of it.
You're the one
who's full of it.

10:31.563 --> 10:32.896
Stop, stop,
stop, stop!

10:32.897 --> 10:35.032
Sit down.
Both of you, sit.

10:35.033 --> 10:39.036
Your mom wants to know
what's going on between you two.

10:39.037 --> 10:40.638
She's not here,
so it's up to me.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.740
Randy, what's the matter
with brad?

10:42.741 --> 10:44.975
I hate him.
You don't hate him.

10:44.976 --> 10:48.279
Turn around and talk to me.
What's the problem with brad?

10:48.280 --> 10:49.947
I hate him a lot.

10:49.948 --> 10:52.015
Not as much
as I hate him.

10:52.016 --> 10:54.017
He won't let me
into my own room.

10:54.018 --> 10:55.553
I can't even do
my homework.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.955
It's not just your room.
You think you own it.

10:57.956 --> 11:00.057
Well, he doesn't own it.
I own it.

11:00.058 --> 11:03.394
Actually, the bank
kind of really owns it...

11:03.395 --> 11:05.396
Guys, you gotta
figure out a way

11:05.397 --> 11:07.931
To work this out by yourselves,
all right?

11:07.932 --> 11:09.767
Randy shouldn't
even have a room.

11:09.768 --> 11:12.503
He should be
at the bottom of lake erie
with the other shrimp.

11:12.504 --> 11:14.071
Brad!

11:14.072 --> 11:16.073
Yeah, and you'd
fit right in on mars,

11:16.074 --> 11:19.009
Where there's no sign
of intelligent life.

11:19.010 --> 11:23.347
First of all...
They've never confirmed that.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.152
And second of all,

11:28.153 --> 11:30.755
I want you guys
to shake hands and make up.

11:30.756 --> 11:34.392
Big brother,
help little brother out.
Come on.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.560
Did you hear what I said?

11:36.561 --> 11:38.462
Shake hands,
right this minute.
Come on, hop to it.

11:40.732 --> 11:42.333
All right. Good men.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.769
Quit squeezing!

11:44.770 --> 11:46.604
You're the one
who's squeezing.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.138
Come on, let go.
You let go.

11:48.139 --> 11:51.609
Both let go.
Let him go. Let...
All right, let go!

11:51.610 --> 11:53.277
All right, down here.

11:53.278 --> 11:55.979
Tried it your mom's way,
that didn't work.
Now it's my way.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.715
I'm splitting you guys up.
What?

11:57.716 --> 12:00.518
I'm moving him into mark's room,
and mark's in with you.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.520
Wait a second!
This is totally unfair.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.388
Why should brad
get his own room?

12:04.389 --> 12:07.057
Because he's the oldest
and because I say so,
all right?

12:07.058 --> 12:10.695
I have to go with dad
on this one.
Don't push it.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.530
This is totally unfair.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.998
Well, life is
totally unfair.

12:14.999 --> 12:18.068
When I was your age,
I wanted my own room,
and I didn't get it.

12:18.069 --> 12:21.572
Come to think of it,
I still don't have my own room.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.950
Got a box.

12:32.951 --> 12:36.186
Dad, I don't wanna
move in with randy.

12:36.187 --> 12:39.590
Oh... Mark, it may seem
like a bad idea now,

12:39.591 --> 12:42.560
But a lot of times
bad things turn into
good things.

12:42.561 --> 12:46.997
What could be good about
sharing a room with randy?
I've been thinking about it.

12:46.998 --> 12:49.700
Maybe you and randy
will get to know
each other better.

12:49.701 --> 12:52.035
When I was your age,
I moved in with steve.

12:52.036 --> 12:54.372
You know uncle steve and I
don't get along.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.874
When we moved in together,
we got real close.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.042
After that, he didn't
beat me up so much.

12:59.043 --> 13:01.746
Really?
Yeah.

13:01.747 --> 13:04.749
I guess that could be
a good thing.
Yeah.

13:04.750 --> 13:09.286
And maybe you and randy
can gang up against brad.

13:09.287 --> 13:11.088
Yeah.
All right.

13:11.089 --> 13:13.056
Thanks, dad.
You bet.

13:16.528 --> 13:18.562
Hi, mom.
Hi, honey.

13:18.563 --> 13:21.499
What are you doing
with that box?
Dad's making me move.

13:24.369 --> 13:25.870
What?

13:25.871 --> 13:28.672
To randy's room.
Now I get to beat up
on brad.

13:30.975 --> 13:33.277
Tim!

13:33.278 --> 13:37.715
Was that you, honey?
I could hardly hear you.

13:37.716 --> 13:40.384
They had a whole bunch
of chamois on sale.

13:40.385 --> 13:41.719
How could you?

13:41.720 --> 13:43.888
You said always look
for bargains.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.390
I mean about switching
the boys' rooms.

13:46.391 --> 13:49.059
Oh. I tried it your way.
It didn't work.

13:49.060 --> 13:53.497
My way was that <i>we</i> told them.
Was I not clear?

13:53.498 --> 13:56.366
We, we, we.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.368
It can be taken so many ways.

13:58.369 --> 14:01.806
To you, it meant "us."
to the french, it means "yes."

14:01.807 --> 14:05.476
To this little piggy,
it meant, "I'm going
all the way home."

14:05.477 --> 14:08.345
I can't believe you made
a decision like this
without me.

14:08.346 --> 14:11.515
If you'd been in the room
arguing with them, you'd
have made the same decision.

14:11.516 --> 14:14.518
No, I would have discussed it
with the boys, waited for you
to come home,

14:14.519 --> 14:16.654
And we could have discussed it
as a family.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.957
And after all the discussion,
the boys would have been,
what, 90?

14:19.958 --> 14:21.725
Great. Make jokes.

14:21.726 --> 14:25.262
Ok. A crocodile
and a giraffe...
Tim...

14:27.899 --> 14:31.535
Honey, I don't need
endless discussions
to make a decision.

14:31.536 --> 14:35.339
Men assess a situation,
boom - done.

14:35.340 --> 14:39.042
Are you saying that men
are more decisive than women?

14:39.043 --> 14:41.411
Oh, it's a fact.

14:41.412 --> 14:44.515
Come on. We don't shop
for three hours for shoes
and handbags.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.284
The first pair of shoes
I see that fit, I buy 'em.

14:47.285 --> 14:51.489
Even if they're
sling-back heels?
If they fit.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.824
You see? Just because men
make hasty decisions

14:53.825 --> 14:55.860
Doesn't mean
that they're the right ones.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.528
Men aren't yammerers.

14:57.529 --> 15:01.298
Is that what you think?
You think that I yammer?

15:01.299 --> 15:04.301
Jill, you're a yammer-er.

15:04.302 --> 15:06.837
Well, you're a yack-ass!

15:11.643 --> 15:15.412
<i>(camera shutter clicking)</i>

15:22.754 --> 15:24.488
Evening, wilson.

15:24.489 --> 15:27.958
Heavenly-ho,
good neighbor.

15:27.959 --> 15:30.060
What are you doing?

15:30.061 --> 15:35.065
Tim, I am shooting the moon.

15:35.066 --> 15:38.736
Aren't you supposed
to have your pants down
for that?

15:41.272 --> 15:44.742
No, no, no, no, no, tim.
I'm taking time-lapse
photographs.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.344
I'm tracking the path
of the blue moon.

15:47.345 --> 15:50.180
I'm taking
some very spectacular shots.

15:50.181 --> 15:53.383
That's funny. Jill just took
some spectacular shots at me.

15:53.384 --> 15:56.754
Something's out of orbit
in the taylor universe.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.789
I suppose you could say that.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.291
I made a big decision
without asking her.

16:01.292 --> 16:03.794
I wanted to stop the boys
from fighting,

16:03.795 --> 16:05.796
So I put them
in separate bedrooms.

16:05.797 --> 16:08.866
Mm-mm-mm. Well,
that's a tough decision
to make unilaterally.

16:08.867 --> 16:12.970
Yeah. Jill figured
I should have made it
double-laterally.

16:14.372 --> 16:16.040
She used that word?

16:17.676 --> 16:20.277
No. No, she doesn't have
a big vocabulary

16:20.278 --> 16:22.212
Like you and me.

16:23.748 --> 16:26.750
I thought if I separated them,
it would stop them
from fighting.

16:26.751 --> 16:29.753
Oh, I see. Well, tim,
what were they fighting
about?

16:29.754 --> 16:32.756
They're boys.
They fight about everything.
What does it matter?

16:32.757 --> 16:35.092
Well, tim, what you're
describing to me

16:35.093 --> 16:38.328
Brings to mind
the verruca vulgaris.

16:38.329 --> 16:42.666
Uhh?
Also known
as the common wart.

16:42.667 --> 16:46.604
You're calling my sons warts?
Not that I mind...

16:46.605 --> 16:49.640
No, no, no, no, no, no, tim.
What I'm trying to say is,

16:49.641 --> 16:52.743
Most people think the best way
to get rid of a wart
is to cut it off,

16:52.744 --> 16:55.579
But in actuality
that isn't the best solution.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.414
See, the wart will reappear

16:57.415 --> 17:00.050
Because the virus is still
below the surface of the skin.

17:00.051 --> 17:02.519
So just putting my two warts
in separate rooms

17:02.520 --> 17:04.521
Isn't gonna cure
this problem, huh?

17:04.521 --> 17:07.657
No. No, tim, the only way
to get rid of a wart

17:07.659 --> 17:10.661
Is to go beneath the surface
of the oily skin

17:10.662 --> 17:13.163
And dig out the root.

17:13.164 --> 17:16.133
I see. Thanks.

17:16.134 --> 17:17.601
Mm-hmm.

17:17.602 --> 17:19.269
Wilson?
Mm-hmm?

17:19.270 --> 17:23.173
This is bar none
the most disgusting
conversation we've ever had.

17:25.042 --> 17:26.944
<i>(chuckles)</i>

17:26.944 --> 17:30.014
<i>(knock on door)</i>

17:30.015 --> 17:31.649
Hi.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.651
Hi.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.185
Where's mark?

17:35.186 --> 17:37.154
I don't know.

17:37.155 --> 17:40.490
Did you stuff him
in one of these drawers?

17:42.694 --> 17:44.194
Not funny, huh?

17:44.195 --> 17:48.132
It's about as funny
as what dad did.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.567
You think
you could talk to him?

17:50.568 --> 17:53.671
Would you feel better
if things went back
to the way they were?

17:53.672 --> 17:56.006
I'd feel better
if I had my own room.

17:56.007 --> 17:58.008
Unfortunately, that's not
gonna be an option.

17:58.009 --> 18:00.010
So what are my options?

18:00.011 --> 18:01.712
Living with the dork

18:01.713 --> 18:04.815
Or living with brad
who talks on the phone
all day.

18:04.816 --> 18:07.484
Honey, brad is
in junior high school now.

18:07.485 --> 18:10.253
He's got a lot
of new stuff happening.

18:10.254 --> 18:13.323
He's meeting new friends,
getting interested in girls...

18:13.324 --> 18:15.325
Let me get this straight.

18:15.326 --> 18:18.662
Brad gets new friends,
girls and his own room

18:18.663 --> 18:20.597
And I get mark?

18:23.201 --> 18:27.971
I'm sorry. I know
that this is hard for you.

18:27.972 --> 18:31.842
I remember
when my sister hit her teens.

18:31.843 --> 18:36.046
She was doing all
this interesting stuff
that I wished I was doing.

18:36.047 --> 18:37.881
Well, like what?

18:37.882 --> 18:39.950
Well, she got her own room.

18:39.951 --> 18:43.187
She started wearing makeup,
shaving her legs.

18:43.188 --> 18:47.191
Can you imagine how I felt
when she got to wear a bra

18:47.192 --> 18:49.860
And I was still wearing
a dorky undershirt?

18:49.861 --> 18:53.831
Yeah, I can. When do you think
I'll get to wear a bra, mom?

18:56.500 --> 19:00.204
Ok. Ok, that's probably
not the greatest example.

19:00.205 --> 19:03.874
But what I mean is...
I got older, you know,

19:03.875 --> 19:06.777
And I got to have
some of those same experiences.

19:06.778 --> 19:09.379
I can't say the shaving the legs
part was so great,

19:09.380 --> 19:11.381
But then my sister moved out.

19:11.382 --> 19:13.083
Then you got your own room.

19:13.084 --> 19:16.386
No, then dad turned it
into a study.

19:16.387 --> 19:18.555
Great.
Don't worry.

19:18.556 --> 19:21.258
With your father,
you won't have that problem.

19:23.561 --> 19:25.562
Yeah. Dad's idea of a study

19:25.563 --> 19:28.498
Is a toilet
and three hot-rod magazines.

19:33.437 --> 19:36.807
You know, randy,
there are some advantages

19:36.808 --> 19:40.077
To sharing a room
with a younger kid.

19:40.078 --> 19:44.414
Such as?
You have always wanted
to have the upper bunk.

19:44.415 --> 19:46.917
You get to listen
to more of your music,

19:46.918 --> 19:49.887
Nobody can kick you
out of your room.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.889
Yeah...

19:51.890 --> 19:54.624
But I can always
kick mark out.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.161
I didn't say that.

19:57.162 --> 20:00.931
Oh, who knows?
Maybe one of these days
I'll completely lose my mind

20:00.932 --> 20:04.168
And let your father build
another room.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.336
I don't think so, mom.

20:11.276 --> 20:14.344
Jill. Jill...

20:14.345 --> 20:16.413
We gotta talk.
No, it's not necessary.

20:16.414 --> 20:18.648
I've been thinking
about what you said,

20:18.649 --> 20:21.251
And I think women do need
to be more decisive.

20:21.252 --> 20:24.254
So I've decided that
we should move my car
into the garage

20:24.255 --> 20:26.256
And your hot rod
out to the street

20:26.257 --> 20:28.758
And I should paint
all your tools pink.
No, no.

20:28.759 --> 20:31.862
I also decided
that I'm not doing
any more of your laundry.

20:31.863 --> 20:34.965
Ok, ok, ok,
I get your point.

20:34.966 --> 20:38.135
And I've decided
that no matter what I do,

20:38.136 --> 20:40.637
Those warts are going
back to bulgaria.

20:43.474 --> 20:46.576
Why do I even try
to talk to you?

20:46.577 --> 20:48.745
We've got to get
beneath the oily surface

20:48.746 --> 20:50.881
To the root
of the boys' problem.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.217
I've already gotten
to the root of the problem.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.618
Randy feels brad
is leaving him behind.

20:55.619 --> 20:57.620
What do you mean?
Brad's growing up.

20:57.621 --> 21:00.824
He doesn't want to spend time
hanging around with his
little brother anymore.

21:00.825 --> 21:02.692
That's what this is about?

21:02.693 --> 21:04.694
Yeah. It was bound
to happen, I guess.

21:04.695 --> 21:08.265
Yeah. There was a time
my brothers didn't want me
tagging around with them.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.500
Did it bum you out?

21:10.501 --> 21:13.003
Not really, 'cause
I'd tag along anyway.

21:13.004 --> 21:14.938
Bummed them out.
I bet.

21:14.939 --> 21:16.940
They'd go to the drive-in
with their girlfriends.

21:16.941 --> 21:19.609
I'd sit in back and pop up
when they were starting
to make their move

21:19.610 --> 21:22.079
With a fright wig and...
<i>(makes gurgling noise)</i>

21:22.080 --> 21:25.515
<i>(randy)</i> get out of my room!
<i>(mark)</i> it's my room, too!

21:25.516 --> 21:27.885
Let me in! <i>(banging on door)</i>
get out of my room!

21:27.886 --> 21:30.520
<i>(pretends to sob)</i>

21:30.521 --> 21:33.090
I just made
another decision.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.624
Puerto rico?

21:34.625 --> 21:36.693
It's nice this time of year.

21:46.337 --> 21:48.305
Hi.

21:48.306 --> 21:50.073
Hi.

21:51.342 --> 21:54.011
Is it all right
if I hang out in here?

21:54.012 --> 21:56.313
If you want.

21:56.314 --> 21:59.749
I've gotta get away from mom.

21:59.750 --> 22:03.320
Why? Did she tell you
the bra story?

22:05.523 --> 22:09.159
No. She keeps bugging me
about my new room.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.161
You know,
having your own room

22:11.162 --> 22:13.363
Isn't as great
as you think it is.

22:13.364 --> 22:15.165
Why not?

22:15.166 --> 22:17.667
<i>(sighs)</i> because mom says
it's a privilege

22:17.668 --> 22:21.905
And with privilege
comes more responsibility.

22:21.906 --> 22:23.974
Sounds bad.

22:23.975 --> 22:26.410
No kidding.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.279
I even have to do
my own laundry.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.649
Oh, man.

22:32.650 --> 22:36.453
But it's not that bad.
See, I figured it out.

22:36.454 --> 22:38.755
I'll only have to do it
once a month

22:38.756 --> 22:40.757
If I turn my shirts
inside out

22:40.758 --> 22:43.660
And, um, I wear my underwear
three times.

22:43.661 --> 22:47.564
Brad, do me a little favor.

22:47.565 --> 22:50.767
When it gets to
the end of the month,

22:50.768 --> 22:52.869
Stay in your own room.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.510
Hey.

23:03.047 --> 23:05.782
Can you imagine how I felt
when she got to wear a bra

23:05.783 --> 23:08.352
And I was still wearing
a dorky undershirt?

23:08.353 --> 23:10.587
Yeah, I can.

23:24.268 --> 23:26.669
<i>(shouts)</i>

23:26.670 --> 23:36.746
No!
