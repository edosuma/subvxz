02:59.221 --> 03:00.561
Okay.

03:20.409 --> 03:21.989
[cell phone dings]

03:29.292 --> 03:31.002
- [sighs]
- [woman] Jean!

03:31.670 --> 03:33.960
Oh, hey, Holly, what a nice surprise.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.837
I thought you worked in the city.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.014
Um, I have mornings off half the week.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.013
You know, it's so bizarre,
I was actually gonna call you today.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.056
Yeah? What's going on?

03:43.140 --> 03:46.390
Well I heard about
the whole debacle at school.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.766
About Dolly.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.273
Michelle spoke to the other mothers,
and Eleanor happened to hear,

03:51.356 --> 03:54.856
and told me, you know,
the whole telephone game.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.200
Yeah, well, I spoke to the principal.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.448
All under control.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.701
Uh, the thing is, is, um...

04:01.783 --> 04:04.123
I looked at Dolly's evite for her party

04:04.203 --> 04:06.663
and noticed Michelle hasn't RSVP'd yet.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.754
You know,
I think it's probably better that way.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.665
Who needs that kind of drama?

04:14.755 --> 04:18.045
But we are so excited, of course.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.933
Oh, wait till you see
what Dylan picked out for Dolly.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.011
Oh, that's very sweet of you.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.517
I'm looking forward to it.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.394
Making anything special?

04:27.476 --> 04:30.646
Oh, no, I'm just grabbing the basics.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.728
I don't cook the way you do.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.065
[laughs] Never too late to learn.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.567
Have a great day.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.798
[papers rustling]

05:36.753 --> 05:39.173
[papers rustling]

06:07.951 --> 06:10.451
[Sam] I went in last week
and did all the start paperwork.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.416
Oh, and I'm gonna need
to figure out new times with you.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.289
That's fine.
I'm just glad to hear you're going back.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.054
Yeah, well.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.548
[laughing] It's about time.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.885
- [Jean] How are you otherwise?
- Good.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.773
I mean, glad that's all settled.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.653
But, uh...

06:36.730 --> 06:39.110
I guess my big news is
that I randomly ended up

06:39.190 --> 06:40.790
hanging out with Sidney the other night.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.278
Really? When?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.702
[Sam]
Well, I dropped off the box, remember?

06:45.781 --> 06:46.951
Of her things.

06:47.574 --> 06:51.124
And I guess she went through them
and probably felt bad

06:51.203 --> 06:53.293
or maybe nostalgic.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.499
Anyway, she texted saying thanks,
and we ended up grabbing a drink.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.748
- How'd it go?
- [Sam] It was nice.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.760
Really nice, actually.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.434
It's like...

07:06.510 --> 07:08.600
for all the fucked up ways
she made me feel,

07:08.679 --> 07:10.639
she's also the only person
who can fix me.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.853
Well, I'm sure it seems that way,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.654
but I think you're far too close
to the situation

07:16.728 --> 07:18.608
to have any real perspective.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.979
But she doesn't know I am.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.025
She's convinced
I'm already dating someone else.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.529
Is she seeing anyone?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.237
[Sam] Well, I mean...

07:26.488 --> 07:27.608
I'm sure she is.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.488
She's always seeing someone.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.198
She can't live without the attention.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.460
But it's probably just
some bullshit distraction.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.133
She did say something kind of weird.

07:42.087 --> 07:45.837
I'm actually not sure how to interpret it.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.050
She mentioned some woman.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.966
- Interesting.
- She didn't say much.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.016
And I didn't pry, because I'm never gonna
get a straight answer out of her

07:56.101 --> 07:57.481
unless she wants to give it.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.900
But she seemed curious.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.443
Do you have any idea
why she brought this woman up?

08:06.612 --> 08:07.652
I don't know.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.737
Right.

08:09.198 --> 08:15.698
So, this week's homework
might seem extreme,

08:17.080 --> 08:19.500
but it's very typical practice...

08:20.917 --> 08:22.957
when dealing with any kind of addiction.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.341
[paper tearing]

08:44.024 --> 08:46.074
It does seem kind of extreme.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.652
I know how much you care,

08:48.737 --> 08:51.027
and how much you think
you need her, I get it.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.195
But I just want to see you
moving forward, Sam.

08:55.744 --> 08:59.214
The more exposure,
the harder it'll be to get off the drug.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.788
Think about it.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.383
Take it home.

09:05.921 --> 09:06.921
Okay.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.625
[paper rustling]

09:08.715 --> 09:09.715
And remember,

09:10.300 --> 09:14.140
even if it feels good,
she's not the solution.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.901
- [Larin] Jeanie.
- Hey.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.533
Hey, we missed you the other night.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.399
Oh, yeah,
I was bummed I couldn't make it.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.316
[Larin] I'm shocked
the "desperate housewives"

09:31.405 --> 09:32.445
kept you out so late.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.121
Those guys can drink.

09:34.533 --> 09:38.373
Actually, Natalie got so tanked
we didn't even make it out.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.543
I have like half the place decorated,
so we sat on the floor,

09:41.623 --> 09:43.083
and we drank out of plastic cups.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.746
- Nice.
- Total throwback.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.804
Anyway, I really, I want you to see it.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.090
Okay, how about Monday after work?

09:50.174 --> 09:52.514
I'll get Stacey to stay longer.

09:52.593 --> 09:53.893
- Perfect.
- Okay.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.468
<i># Everything is broken #</i>

[radio clicks off]

10:26.001 --> 10:28.201
[Michelle] I don't even know
why she just doesn't get...

10:28.253 --> 10:29.553
[chattering continuing]

10:29.630 --> 10:32.130
- Michelle?
- [woman] Listen, we're all that they see.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.426
- Michelle?
- Jean, hi.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.391
Look, I wanted to apologize
for what happened the other day.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.101
I just think it's Doll's way
of showing her affection for Sadie.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.482
Of course, they're eight.
She's just expressing herself.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.900
Great, thanks.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.769
And listen, I was actually thinking

10:46.855 --> 10:48.665
we should get the girls together
for a playdate.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.320
Oh, okay, let me see.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.320
Next week's a little tricky.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.703
Well, we're totally flexible.

10:56.031 --> 10:59.081
Okay, uh, why don't you guys
come over next Thursday, then.

10:59.910 --> 11:00.950
- We'll be there.
- Great.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.116
[Dolly] Mom!

11:02.203 --> 11:03.583
Oh, there's my cue.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.212
See you next Thursday.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.713
- [Jean] Hey, honey.
- Hi.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.046
- So, how was it?
- Good.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.354
My favorite part was that
we had indoor recess.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.428
And we got to play <i>Star Wars,</i>
and I was a Jedi.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.062
Which character?

11:23.267 --> 11:26.847
[toy car whirring]

11:29.815 --> 11:31.815
Mom, when am I getting my haircut?

11:32.317 --> 11:35.777
You've got beautiful hair, honey.
We've talked about this.

11:36.237 --> 11:40.327
But I don't want it to look beautiful.
Do you think GI Joe has beautiful hair?

11:40.409 --> 11:42.619
- No.
- Enough, please.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.203
Have you finished your homework?

11:44.288 --> 11:46.118
Yes, yes, yes.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.536
Well, can I check it?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.959
[chopping]

11:51.795 --> 11:55.415
- [cell phone ringing]
- Hold on, hold on.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.386
Hey, honey,
I'm just in the middle of cooking.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.970
[Michael] <i>Oh, really? What's the occasion?</i>

12:04.391 --> 12:05.561
Shut up.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.146
I just didn't want
to make spaghetti again.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.108
So, get this, I have made...

12:12.316 --> 12:13.936
beef bourguignon.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.196
[Michael] <i>Oh, wow, that sounds difficult.</i>

12:16.278 --> 12:18.528
Yeah, well, I'm figuring it out.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.454
[Michael]
<i>I can't believe I'm gonna miss it.</i>

12:20.532 --> 12:22.622
<i>I'm slammed at the office.</i>

12:22.868 --> 12:25.698
What? Well, we'll wait for you.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.827
[Michael] <i>Oh, no, I might be a while.</i>

12:27.914 --> 12:30.544
<i>You guys just go ahead.
I'll grab something here.</i>

12:31.584 --> 12:33.844
Okay, we'll see you later.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.970
Mom, when's daddy coming home?

12:37.841 --> 12:40.841
Um... after bedtime.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.720
[sighs]

12:45.807 --> 12:46.807
Shit.

[door opens]

15:36.728 --> 15:40.068
[water running]

15:42.484 --> 15:44.744
- Hi, stranger.
- Hey.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.276
I was waiting for you.

15:47.364 --> 15:51.034
- [Michael] Oh, really?
- Yeah.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.198
[Michael chuckling]

15:53.287 --> 15:54.577
- [Jean] Hey.
- Hi.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.996
Maybe I should work late more often.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.336
Very funny.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.379
[sighing] How was work?

16:05.716 --> 16:07.586
[Michael] Um, well...

16:08.719 --> 16:11.809
Alan offered me his tickets
to the Islanders game.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.062
You're in the big leagues now.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.521
I told you, I told you, I told you,
I'm a worthy bet.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.233
Never doubted it.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.694
So, how was your fancy dinner?

16:25.360 --> 16:28.530
I can't wait to try this
beef "bourbonnon."

16:29.990 --> 16:31.240
Bourguignon.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.540
We finished it. It was that good.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
Oh.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.251
Well, I thought you ate at the office.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.211
Yeah, well, I was just gonna snack
on stuff. That's fine.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.670
I'll, um...

16:44.629 --> 16:46.839
I think maybe
I'm gonna make some pasta.

16:46.924 --> 16:47.924
Okay.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.436
- You gotta put that olive oil in...
- Yeah, I got this.

16:58.519 --> 17:00.849
I know you're all cocky
from your beef "bouronnon,"

17:00.938 --> 17:05.608
but I remember a Bananas Foster incident
that didn't go so well.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.742
Shut up.

17:06.818 --> 17:10.407
I didn't realize you were supposed
to put only three teaspoons of rum in it.

17:10.489 --> 17:11.868
Instead of 30?

17:12.449 --> 17:15.699
My favorite part was your mom's face
when she was pretending to like it.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.539
I'm pretty sure
she cleaned her plate, too.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.422
[chopping]

17:20.499 --> 17:22.999
Yeah, well, at least she was supportive
with that.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.744
[Michael chuckles]

17:25.753 --> 17:29.724
- Okay, for the dishes, tonight?
- Yeah.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.928
- You wanna cut?
- Yeah, I do.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.471
Get your hands off my cards.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.138
Let's go.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.728
Fuck.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.397
- Not a good start, Holloway.
- Yeah.

17:51.655 --> 17:52.735
Huh...

17:59.830 --> 18:03.170
You wanna double-down on the trash?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.460
- Sure.
- Okay.

18:07.379 --> 18:08.459
I'll stay.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.011
- Staying, too.
- Really?

18:15.220 --> 18:17.600
You gotta be kidding me.
But you raised your eyebrows.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.311
- That's your tell.
- No, I know you think that's my tell,

18:20.392 --> 18:22.772
but it's called outsmarting you.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.733
How weird.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.359
[chuckling]

18:27.733 --> 18:29.533
[pots clattering]

18:35.073 --> 18:36.333
Hey, uh...

18:37.868 --> 18:41.618
I didn't realize
that Sexy Lexi was on your personal calls.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.214
No, that's her job.
She has to note anything that's important.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.882
Well, but that's for work, right? Not me.

18:48.961 --> 18:54.591
Okay, well, you know,
if you start to say something private,

18:54.675 --> 18:56.425
I'll ask her to jump off.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.309
Well, it's all private, don't you think?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.313
Bourbon again?

19:02.893 --> 19:05.403
Yeah, it's kinda growing on me.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.030
[Claire] <i>It was never like this before.</i>

19:14.612 --> 19:17.702
When she was in high school,
she built the sets for the school play.

19:18.617 --> 19:19.987
They were doing <i>Pippin.</i>

19:20.702 --> 19:23.872
I would come in the theater
and sit and watch.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.081
She never minded.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.788
That was a long time ago.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.836
People evolve, so do relationships.

19:31.922 --> 19:32.802
I know.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.471
I was just giving you context.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.468
We're not talking about
a small change here.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.431
I barely get her for two minutes
on the phone when she calls.

19:41.515 --> 19:42.515
Let me ask you,

19:42.558 --> 19:46.098
what do you think Rebecca's take
on your relationship is right now?

19:46.186 --> 19:50.476
Well, she'd probably say
I'm overbearing, and too judgmental,

19:51.483 --> 19:52.733
but I'm her mother.

19:53.694 --> 19:56.744
And no one else is gonna stay up at night
and worry like I am.

19:57.906 --> 20:02.036
I want Rebecca
to be settled down and happy.

20:03.579 --> 20:05.709
Well, you know, you have a kid.

20:07.457 --> 20:11.377
There's nothing more painful
than not being aware of their lifestyle.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.052
It seems that you've been disappointed

20:15.132 --> 20:17.892
with Rebecca's choices
for a long time now.

20:17.968 --> 20:18.798
Do you think...

20:18.884 --> 20:21.054
do you think she started changing
with the new job?

20:21.637 --> 20:23.757
Yes... yes.

20:23.849 --> 20:27.139
[chuckling]
She started not having enough time for me.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.227
It's really that simple.

20:28.312 --> 20:33.732
But you've heard me say before
that relationships aren't singular, right?

20:35.235 --> 20:38.855
Did you contribute at all
to Rebecca pushing you away?

20:38.947 --> 20:41.577
No, I stayed the same.

20:42.576 --> 20:45.286
I've been the same. She changed.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.712
You know, I really like you, Jean, but...

20:49.791 --> 20:51.251
honestly, I've been thinking lately

20:51.335 --> 20:53.795
that maybe therapy
isn't helping me that much.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.173
Maybe we...

20:56.798 --> 20:58.218
Do you think it's...

20:58.967 --> 21:00.507
Maybe it's time to take a break.

21:01.762 --> 21:02.852
[scoffs]

21:04.431 --> 21:06.101
I'm sorry you feel that way.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.444
[pencil tapping]

21:10.729 --> 21:13.769
She's just not willing
to take any responsibility.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.527
She pins the whole thing on Rebecca.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.609
Yikes. Does she have any hobbies?

21:17.694 --> 21:20.074
No, I've encouraged that, too, I...

21:20.155 --> 21:25.405
Jean, remember, our job is not
to do the work for our patients.

21:25.494 --> 21:29.464
Sometimes we're just here to listen,
to be a sounding board.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.920
- [stammers]
- And realize that you can't fix everyone.

21:33.001 --> 21:36.301
Yeah, I know. I get it.
Trust me, I have tried.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.720
But I am just tired
of sitting in that office

21:38.799 --> 21:42.049
listening to the same old story
week after week with no results.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.595
It's frustrating.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.520
And now she's questioning
the value of therapy, the value of me.

21:47.599 --> 21:51.019
That's the hardest part of this job.
Sometimes you get stuck.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.313
I know. I am literally at the point

21:53.397 --> 21:56.067
where I cannot trust a single word
she says about Rebecca.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.819
But Claire is your patient, not Rebecca.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.908
You work with what she brings
into the room,

22:01.989 --> 22:03.739
whether that's delusional or real.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.665
Oh, Jean, do you have a sec?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.630
Yeah, of course, what's going on?

22:18.589 --> 22:19.759
Well...

22:21.008 --> 22:22.718
I know this is sensitive,

22:23.051 --> 22:27.221
but Melissa Saugraves' psychiatrist
at Bellevue actually reached out again.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.824
He wanted to speak out more about
what she's sharing in session.

22:29.892 --> 22:32.982
Yeah, well, she's borderline.
She'll say anything.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.940
But I think it might be worth getting
on the phone with him yourself,

22:37.024 --> 22:39.784
just to explain
that her accusations are unfounded.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.900
I don't think that's a good idea.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.777
I really just don't want to engage.

22:43.864 --> 22:46.994
Well, she's supposedly doing a lot better.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.575
Might even be released soon.

22:50.204 --> 22:52.374
I can't get involved, you know?

22:52.456 --> 22:56.916
She's just too erratic,
and I need to maintain my boundaries.

22:57.628 --> 23:01.668
Okay. Of course. I understand.

23:22.945 --> 23:26.445
[telephone clicking]

23:28.075 --> 23:29.575
[ringing]

23:29.660 --> 23:31.430
[voicemail]
<i>Record your message after the tone.</i>

23:31.453 --> 23:33.963
- [beeps]
- Hi, Allison. This is Jean Holloway.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.039
I was expecting you at 3:00 p.m.

23:37.626 --> 23:43.376
If you can call the office, please,
at 212-555-0168, and we can discuss.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.545
Thank you.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.491
[exhales]

24:30.304 --> 24:32.604
[machine whirring]

24:35.849 --> 24:37.809
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.943
I think you'd prefer it that way.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.186
Hey, Max, can you cover?

24:42.773 --> 24:45.283
I was actually just stopping by
for a quick coffee.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.490
I have to get back to work.

24:47.321 --> 24:49.071
Don't writers work in coffee shops?

24:49.364 --> 24:51.124
[Jean] Not all types.

24:51.742 --> 24:53.162
You want me to take you on a tour?

24:54.328 --> 24:57.578
Well, as long as you promise
to give me that coffee after, sure.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.174
- I'll make it extra special.
- [Jean] Deal.

25:06.798 --> 25:09.638
Well, here we have the magic
of the storeroom,

25:09.718 --> 25:12.298
where I grind the coffee, wash the mugs.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.641
All the brilliant parts
of being a barista.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.228
Well, I'm always up for an education.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.530
You gotta know
where your coffee comes from.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.692
- Get to the source.
- [Jean] Couldn't agree more.

25:25.234 --> 25:28.784
In fact, I was curious about your story.

25:28.862 --> 25:32.412
Well, I live in Bushwick, and I work here.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.523
What else do you want to know?

25:35.452 --> 25:37.252
What it feels like to be you.

25:40.874 --> 25:43.344
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

25:44.503 --> 25:47.173
Clearly have a strong effect on people.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.216
And how would you know that?

25:51.468 --> 25:54.348
From what you said the other night
about your ex.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.180
Sam?

25:57.432 --> 25:59.352
Yeah, that is so over.

26:01.935 --> 26:05.305
Although... we did end up
having a drink the other night.

26:05.399 --> 26:07.689
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?

26:08.861 --> 26:10.031
You know, it was fine.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.910
I don't know,
the whole time I just kept thinking...

26:14.616 --> 26:16.536
I can't believe we ever dated.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.624
So why do you see him at all?
Play with his feelings like that?

26:20.914 --> 26:25.254
I mean, you're obviously aware
that you're alluring and charming.

26:25.836 --> 26:27.416
Maybe he's still in love with you.

26:28.172 --> 26:30.472
Well, that's his responsibility.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.598
If he can't handle it,
he shouldn't have come.

26:35.219 --> 26:38.469
I'm glad to know
you think I'm so alluring.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.901
Oh, um, Monday night my friend Josh
is hosting this pop up thing in Bushwick.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.361
I have plans, actually.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.859
I thought you were curious.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.282
[chuckles]

26:50.360 --> 26:53.530
- It's a little more complicated than that.
- Right.

26:53.614 --> 26:54.824
Well, uh...

26:55.365 --> 26:58.535
it's off the Morgan stop,
at the old Red Lumber factory.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.040
If you feel like a change.

27:21.975 --> 27:24.015
Allison, what are you doing here?

27:24.101 --> 27:25.441
There was no one out front to...

27:26.019 --> 27:27.519
Well, there's a waiting room.

27:27.606 --> 27:29.646
You're supposed to sit there
until I come get you,

27:29.733 --> 27:31.573
and you're late today.

27:31.985 --> 27:33.275
At least I came.

27:34.863 --> 27:36.623
It doesn't work like that.

27:36.907 --> 27:39.697
We make an appointment,
we agree on a time, and you show up.

27:39.785 --> 27:42.495
Okay, fine, I'm sorry I'm late, but...

27:42.579 --> 27:44.789
I came here
to talk to you about some real shit.

27:44.873 --> 27:47.843
I mean,
I didn't sleep last night, and I keep...

27:47.918 --> 27:49.288
Allison, are you...

27:50.212 --> 27:51.212
are you on something?

27:51.255 --> 27:52.255
[scoffs]

27:54.089 --> 27:57.009
You're accusing me of being on drugs.
Now I'm for real.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.030
Fucking unbelievable.
This is what I get...

28:00.055 --> 28:03.055
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Okay, I understand.

28:03.684 --> 28:07.154
Just... just please sit
for one minute, okay?

28:10.941 --> 28:15.281
I know you want to displace your anger
onto me, and that's fine.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.030
But it's not actually gonna help.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.200
There's no need to be defensive or angry,

28:20.284 --> 28:21.414
I just...

28:21.992 --> 28:24.582
I need to know
whether you took something today.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.130
Fine...

28:32.254 --> 28:34.094
Okay, I took a few pills.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.843
Well, I took two pills before I came.

28:38.427 --> 28:40.637
That's okay. I'm not mad, I just...

28:41.887 --> 28:45.137
I can't treat you while you're high. So...

28:46.141 --> 28:49.021
we can schedule something
for early next week.

28:49.104 --> 28:51.694
[crying]

28:51.773 --> 28:53.323
I don't know what to do.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.397
I don't know what to do, please,
just tell me what to do.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.775
Just tell me...
Just tell me what to do.

28:58.864 --> 29:01.034
It's okay, it's okay. You can let it out.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.284
[sobbing]
Please just tell me what to do.

29:04.828 --> 29:06.998
Let it out. It's okay.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.830
[Allison sniffling]

29:13.754 --> 29:17.264
Listen, I know
it feels impossible right now.

29:19.051 --> 29:20.641
But there are programs.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.390
[shuddering]

29:23.472 --> 29:25.312
It's not the drugs, I'm...

29:25.807 --> 29:27.097
Then what is it?

29:28.393 --> 29:32.313
It's Tom. It's my boyfriend. He...

29:32.397 --> 29:35.187
[gasping] I came home last time

29:35.275 --> 29:38.895
after coming to see you,
and I said that we should cool it.

29:38.987 --> 29:43.327
And he got angry,
he's just a different person when he uses.

29:43.408 --> 29:44.488
He can...

29:45.452 --> 29:47.252
[crying]

29:47.329 --> 29:50.869
And he sells everything,
just pills, coke, Fentanyl,

29:50.958 --> 29:53.918
and I won't touch that shit
'cause I know it's too addicting.

29:54.001 --> 29:58.261
But it's gonna be hard to get clean
if you're always around it.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.430
I don't have anybody else.

30:01.802 --> 30:04.012
I can't count on my mom.

30:06.390 --> 30:09.560
What would you do if you found out
your daughter was a fuck-up?

30:16.233 --> 30:18.943
It's okay. You can stay here for a while.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.276
I'm not gonna send you home like this.

30:22.447 --> 30:23.947
You can rest here.

30:25.784 --> 30:26.994
Lie down.

30:45.093 --> 30:49.263
- [sniffles]
- It's okay, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

30:49.683 --> 30:52.193
I just don't think I can give him up.

30:55.105 --> 30:58.395
I don't think I have the power.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.850
[typing]

31:56.875 --> 31:59.205
["Francine" by Esme Patterson playing]

32:08.095 --> 32:12.265

32:16.687 --> 32:21.067

It's true,
I feel like a shocking disappointment.

32:37.999 --> 32:41.959
It's like, unless you announce
you're pregnant, engaged,

32:42.045 --> 32:44.795
got a promotion or all of the above,

32:44.882 --> 32:47.302
- you are doomed to fail.
- Mm,

and throw in a few pictures
from an exotic safari for good measure.

32:50.512 --> 32:51.512
[laughing] Exactly.

32:51.555 --> 32:55.225
You do all of that,
but if you don't look your best,

32:55.309 --> 32:57.349
everyone comments anyway.

32:57.436 --> 32:59.726
- It's like it's Easter.
- Hmm.

33:01.481 --> 33:02.981
Who cares what I'm wearing?

33:06.403 --> 33:08.993
I just, um, broke the news

that I was spending Thanksgiving this year
with my friends.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.196
How'd you manage that?

33:14.286 --> 33:16.576
[Rebecca]
I explained that it's toxic for me.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.078
[groans, laughs]

33:21.168 --> 33:24.918
I'm sure my mother and my cousins
talk about how fucked up I am.

33:25.005 --> 33:26.125
Whatever.

33:27.758 --> 33:29.218
I'm beginning not to care.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.013
Can I ask, is that a new thing?

33:33.597 --> 33:35.557
Kind of. I mean, I've always controlled

33:35.639 --> 33:39.519
what I told my family,
but it's just spiraled from there.

33:39.603 --> 33:40.603
[Jean] Mm.

33:41.230 --> 33:43.230
It's my mother, really.

33:45.442 --> 33:48.652
After my dad passed,
she just tightened the reins. It's...

33:49.236 --> 33:50.606
I can't breathe.

33:51.448 --> 33:53.448
- [woman] We're ready for you.
- [Rebecca] Perfect.

33:54.785 --> 33:57.825
- See you soon, Diane.
- See you, Rebecca.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.594
Just felt like a blowout. [sniffs]

34:09.675 --> 34:11.215
Just felt like a blowout.

34:12.553 --> 34:13.643
[elevator dinging]

34:13.719 --> 34:16.770
- Yay, you're finally here.
- Hey!

34:17.139 --> 34:19.520
Oh, I literally,
I sprinted home from work.

34:19.601 --> 34:22.900
I had to pick up more chardonnay.
Divorce equals high tolerance, I swear.

34:22.980 --> 34:24.270
[Jean laughing]

34:24.356 --> 34:27.315
[Jean] Holy shit. This is really nice.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.321
[laughing]
[Larin] I know, right?

34:29.402 --> 34:31.152
Darryl came over the other day.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.658
- What?
- He couldn't believe it.

34:33.907 --> 34:37.327
With what I got out of that divorce,
I swear I can afford this place.

34:37.411 --> 34:40.541
Every morning I'm a little more grateful
he was a fucking philanderer.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.462
[Jean laughing]

34:41.538 --> 34:46.038
I told you, I still have a lot to do.
I've got that table, I need another couch.

34:46.128 --> 34:48.418
I gotta get a real coffee table. Wow...

34:48.505 --> 34:50.665
Well, don't worry. You have time.

34:51.214 --> 34:55.143
It's just hard
to figure out what I even like.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.350
I'm so used to
choosing everything with Darryl. It's...

34:59.183 --> 35:02.023
strange to figure out who I am
without him, you know?

35:02.102 --> 35:04.942
Wait a second, didn't you guys
use decorators last time?

35:05.022 --> 35:08.482
Oh, shut up,
I am doing this on my own.

35:08.859 --> 35:11.319
Oh, shit. I'm an idiot.
I didn't bring anything.

35:11.403 --> 35:13.993
Oh, Jeanie, we are so past that.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.123
No, I totally meant to bring something.

35:17.201 --> 35:19.121
You bolted out of supervision.

35:19.203 --> 35:22.213
Oh, yeah, I just felt like a blowout.

35:22.831 --> 35:25.921
Oh, right, your hair.

35:26.001 --> 35:27.131
Looks great.

35:27.211 --> 35:28.671
Thanks, it's just last minute.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.014
What salon?

35:30.088 --> 35:32.378
Um, down by Irving Place.

35:32.466 --> 35:35.756
Oh, Jesus, did you go downtown
to come back uptown?

35:35.844 --> 35:37.934
- I'm sorry.
- It's nothing.

35:38.597 --> 35:40.267
Anyway, let's make a toast.

35:40.641 --> 35:43.891
To this new chapter in your life.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.727
- [glasses clink]
- It's a fresh start.

35:45.812 --> 35:47.192
[laughs] It's inspiring.

35:50.609 --> 35:54.779
[Michael] By my count, that's now
the sixth time that's happened, sixth.

35:58.867 --> 36:02.537
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some fairly standard protocol

36:02.621 --> 36:05.421
on an internal investigation, Frank,
just to be clear.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.247
You cannot continue to withhold
information from me

36:08.335 --> 36:10.125
if you want me to defend your company.

36:11.463 --> 36:14.173
Great, thank you. Goodbye.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.216
I really don't like being lied to.

36:16.301 --> 36:18.301
I mean, just, you know,
let me do my fucking job.

36:18.387 --> 36:20.347
- Sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.

36:20.430 --> 36:22.310
It seems like everyone there is guilty.

36:22.391 --> 36:23.981
It's demoralizing.

36:24.059 --> 36:27.189
Well, you're in this business enough,
you see that a lot, unfortunately.

36:27.271 --> 36:30.651
Oh, I like to think people
are more human than evil.

36:32.484 --> 36:34.404
- [Michael] Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.882
If you wanna bring your dinner in here,
we can keep talking about the case.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.630
Uh, sure.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.765
[giggling]
That's not at all how it happened.

37:13.859 --> 37:17.109
- Okay.
- People here are full of shit.

37:19.489 --> 37:23.739
Anyway, he was a lit agent,
and I worked there as an intern.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.450
And I realize how that sounds,
but, I mean, he wasn't my boss.

37:27.664 --> 37:30.384
We had no interaction
in the office whatsoever.

37:30.751 --> 37:34.091
And when it did get serious,
I gave up the job.

37:34.671 --> 37:37.091
But, uh, whatever, it's over.

37:37.174 --> 37:38.934
It's not even worth talking about.

37:43.305 --> 37:45.425
I went on a date
with my law professor once.

37:45.513 --> 37:49.393
Uh, not actually, or not on purpose.

37:49.478 --> 37:50.808
[laughing] What do you mean?

37:50.896 --> 37:53.376
It was the end of the semester,
and she invited me for a drink,

37:53.440 --> 37:55.570
and I thought it was a festive thing,
you know?

37:55.648 --> 37:56.978
Like, hey, good job.

37:57.066 --> 37:59.236
[laughs] Surprising.

37:59.321 --> 38:00.991
[laughs] Yeah.

38:01.073 --> 38:04.493
It was divorce law
or something equally painful.

38:05.327 --> 38:08.907
So, I find myself at this dark bar,
and she's hitting on me.

38:08.997 --> 38:10.867
I don't know
where she thought it was gonna go.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.455
I told her I had a girlfriend.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.711
- Hmm, is this is before Jean?
- Oh, my God, yes, please.

38:15.794 --> 38:19.094
Jean would kill me for even accidentally
going on a date with someone else.

38:19.174 --> 38:20.184
[laughing]

38:20.259 --> 38:23.099
- [telephone ringing]
- Oh.

38:24.888 --> 38:28.138
If it's Frank,
I don't want to, um, talk to him.

38:29.935 --> 38:31.265
Michael Holloway's office.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.271
[Jean] <i>Hi, Alexis, is Michael there?</i>

38:34.606 --> 38:36.606
- It's Jean.
- Oh.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.284
[Michael] Hey, honey.

38:43.363 --> 38:47.663
<i>Hey, I'm at Larin's apartment.
It's amazing, you would flip.</i>

38:48.704 --> 38:50.544
Well, weren't you there the other night?

38:50.622 --> 38:53.752
<i>Yeah, of course, I just...
She got some new furniture,</i>

38:53.834 --> 38:56.554
<i>so it almost feels like
a totally new place.</i>

38:56.628 --> 38:58.208
Well, you sound pretty envious.

38:58.297 --> 39:02.007
<i>A little, though I can't imagine
chasing Dolly down the street here.</i>

39:02.259 --> 39:04.929
Oh, my God, we'd be packing the bags
within a week, guaranteed.

39:05.012 --> 39:06.352
<i>What train are you taking home?</i>

39:06.430 --> 39:08.350
<i>I was thinking
maybe we could go together.</i>

39:08.432 --> 39:11.812
[sighs] I'm gonna be here late again.

39:11.891 --> 39:14.561
I'm probably just gonna take a car home.
I'm so sorry.

39:15.147 --> 39:17.437
<i>Okay, no worries.
Text me when you're heading home.</i>

39:17.524 --> 39:20.404
- Okay, you too, honey.
- <i>All right, bye, love you.</i>

39:21.695 --> 39:23.155
[telephone clattering]

39:25.032 --> 39:26.332
Uh, you want some more?

39:26.408 --> 39:29.578
- No, uh, thank you.
- Okay.

39:33.746 --> 39:37.246
By the way, when Jean calls,
you don't need to stay on.

39:37.834 --> 39:40.344
Of course, got it.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.596
[Jean] Hi, Stacey.

39:49.681 --> 39:53.101
Yeah, I was just wondering
if you can stay longer.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.598
You can? Oh, great.

39:56.438 --> 39:58.228
You're a lifesaver, thanks.

39:58.732 --> 40:01.402
Okay, I'll see you soon.

40:19.378 --> 40:22.378
[muffled dance music playing]

40:25.425 --> 40:29.715
[distant train horn honking]

40:54.663 --> 40:56.333
Looks like you found Nirvana.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.122
Your other hand.

41:04.047 --> 41:06.547
[music thumping]

41:10.053 --> 41:13.313
[chattering]

42:06.899 --> 42:08.289
[man] Yeah, he's supposed to be coming.

42:08.317 --> 42:09.397
Surprised?

42:09.488 --> 42:10.488
No.

42:11.365 --> 42:12.365
You want?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.660
Yeah, definitely.

42:14.743 --> 42:16.413
Josh, Zal, this is Diane.

42:17.079 --> 42:19.789
Zal and I go way back.
Don't tell her jack shit.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.661
[laughing]

42:27.047 --> 42:28.417
So, how do you know Sid?

42:28.882 --> 42:30.342
Um, well, I...

42:30.425 --> 42:33.005
We just met recently. At the cafÃ©.

42:33.095 --> 42:35.675
Oh. I hate that place.

42:35.764 --> 42:36.764
[laughing]

42:41.603 --> 42:44.153
Did you know Sam, her ex?

42:45.607 --> 42:46.937
Yeah, what about him?

42:48.277 --> 42:50.777
No, nothing. I just, uh, he...

42:51.780 --> 42:55.530
I was surprised. He seems not her type.

42:55.617 --> 42:57.457
I was one of the few
who wanted it to work out,

42:57.536 --> 42:58.866
but he couldn't keep up.

42:59.913 --> 43:02.963
- She's rigorous.
- How so?

43:03.876 --> 43:07.666
Well, it's like,
he was a submissive puppy,

43:08.169 --> 43:09.169
and she was a tiger.

43:12.718 --> 43:18.138
Plus, the whole relationship with Talia
complicated shit with Sam and pfft.

43:18.221 --> 43:19.221
What relationship?

43:21.101 --> 43:22.601
Not just a good barista.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.354
I can see that.

43:24.980 --> 43:28.150
- To good surprises.
- Ditto.

43:35.699 --> 43:37.239
[door opening]

43:39.620 --> 43:41.910
I don't want you to see
behind the curtain.

43:45.459 --> 43:47.879
I know that women wear eyeliner.

43:47.961 --> 43:49.961
It's not like you're spoiling Christmas.

43:50.047 --> 43:52.417
Yeah, but you don't know my secret.

43:53.175 --> 43:56.925
- Actually, I might.
- Is that right?

43:58.722 --> 44:00.772
Well, I found out one tonight.

44:01.558 --> 44:04.438
- Yeah, what's that?
- Talia.

44:04.853 --> 44:06.483
[scoffs] Yeah? So?

44:07.314 --> 44:10.984
We dated for a little bit,
but it's a long and pointless story

44:11.068 --> 44:12.988
because I'm not with her anymore.

44:15.864 --> 44:18.244
But, you know, you shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.833
People tell stories that aren't true.

44:21.203 --> 44:24.123
- Do you?
- I mean, come on.

44:24.498 --> 44:25.998
We all pretend, don't we?

44:26.873 --> 44:29.083
Some of us are just more honest about it.

44:30.003 --> 44:33.803
- I think that's called lying.
- Semantics.

44:39.388 --> 44:41.348
You're like a human Rorschach.

44:41.807 --> 44:43.017
How's that?

44:44.601 --> 44:48.981
You want people to look at you
and see what their fantasy is, don't you?

44:52.067 --> 44:54.947
What I want to know is,
why do you want to know so much about me?

44:56.446 --> 44:59.946
- You're curious to me.
- And that's all?

45:03.287 --> 45:04.787
You can't lie to me.

45:06.039 --> 45:08.669
See, your face.

45:09.418 --> 45:11.168
Completely transparent.

45:13.297 --> 45:16.087
Did you ever think that's just
what I want you to see?

45:22.806 --> 45:24.096
[scoffs]

45:24.847 --> 45:27.927
[dance music playing]

45:28.020 --> 45:31.060
[man] No shit, my dad always
holds money over my head.

45:31.148 --> 45:32.898
Like, I'll get a birthday gift,

45:32.980 --> 45:35.650
but only if I first clean out
his wife's closet

45:35.733 --> 45:38.493
and hang her weird-ass dog trophies.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.949
- Champagne problems.
- Oh, really?

45:41.033 --> 45:42.163
You should talk, Sid.

45:42.242 --> 45:44.922
You guys are lucky you have parents
to even remember your birthdays.

45:44.953 --> 45:46.873
[Zal] Here we go,
we're gonna get a pity party.

45:46.955 --> 45:48.725
[Sidney]
There's nothing shittier than being told

45:48.749 --> 45:50.829
your dad died
while you're at sleepaway camp.

45:51.376 --> 45:53.016
Thursday,
I'm learning how to shave my legs.

45:53.045 --> 45:55.915
Friday, my mom gets out the class,
tell me my dad's dead.

45:56.381 --> 45:57.971
It's almost too fucked up to be real.

46:01.803 --> 46:05.563
[dance music playing]

46:32.376 --> 46:35.126
- I like your story back there.
- What story?

46:35.209 --> 46:38.339
I'm not that gullible,
for your information.

46:38.423 --> 46:39.763
I'm just fucking with you.

46:39.842 --> 46:41.262
How do I know what's real?

46:41.802 --> 46:44.142
Why tell me that story
about your dad in prison

46:44.221 --> 46:46.431
if it's all just a big lie?

46:47.015 --> 46:48.765
It's easier to say he's dead

46:48.851 --> 46:51.101
than tell these annoying fuckers
anything real.

47:14.707 --> 47:16.997
[cell phone ringing]

47:18.797 --> 47:19.627
[Dolly] <i>Hello?</i>

47:19.715 --> 47:21.085
- Oh my God, she's so cute.
- Wait!

47:21.175 --> 47:22.755
- [Dolly] <i>Mommy, where are you?</i>
- Hi.

47:22.843 --> 47:23.843
Give me that! Hey!

47:23.886 --> 47:24.716
- Hey who?
- Hey!

47:24.803 --> 47:26.763
- [Dolly] <i>Mommy?</i>
- Are you fucking kidding me?

47:27.181 --> 47:28.891
You don't just take someone's phone!

47:28.974 --> 47:30.274
That's a total violation.

47:30.350 --> 47:32.100
- Jesus, I was just fucking around.
- No.

47:32.183 --> 47:33.643
Yeah, that's what you do, isn't it?

47:33.726 --> 47:35.286
Sorry,
I wanted to say hi to your niece.

47:35.353 --> 47:37.813
- I don't see what the big deal is.
- No, of course you don't.

47:39.273 --> 47:42.743
- And what does that mean?
- Forget it.

47:48.744 --> 47:51.084
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

47:51.577 --> 47:55.867
Everyone who crosses your path
ends up a fucking casualty.

48:14.686 --> 48:20.066
[sirens wailing distantly]

48:32.993 --> 48:34.953
- [door opens]
- [dog barks]

48:35.037 --> 48:36.787
[Jean] There you go.

48:36.875 --> 48:39.165
Hey, Stacey, I'm sorry I'm so late.

48:39.253 --> 48:40.553
Oh, no worries.

48:41.004 --> 48:42.214
She had trouble sleeping.

48:42.297 --> 48:45.297
I'm sorry. She kept insisting
on FaceTiming you and Michael.

48:45.384 --> 48:47.684
I was at an event.

48:48.178 --> 48:52.178
I couldn't seem to see her.

48:52.891 --> 48:54.811
- Um, here you go.
- Thank you.

48:54.893 --> 48:55.733
Thanks so much.

48:55.811 --> 48:57.441
- Good night.
- I'll see you next time.

48:59.606 --> 49:02.316
[door opening and closing]

49:04.275 --> 49:05.275
[Dolly] Mommy?

49:11.743 --> 49:14.203
- Hey, sweetie.
- I can't sleep.

49:14.997 --> 49:17.457
Oh, what is it, baby?

49:17.875 --> 49:19.165
I missed you.

49:20.544 --> 49:24.264
I missed you, too.
But it's time to go to bed.

49:24.798 --> 49:26.678
Mom, who was that lady?

49:28.177 --> 49:30.257
- What lady?
- On FaceTime?

49:30.843 --> 49:33.683
No one. Just a friend.

49:35.434 --> 49:38.694
Okay, come on, let's go to sleep.

49:40.814 --> 49:43.614
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mommy.

49:44.443 --> 49:45.693
[kisses]

49:46.820 --> 49:48.160
Sweet dreams.

49:55.412 --> 49:56.412
Good night.

50:05.255 --> 50:06.545
[sighs]

50:07.799 --> 50:09.799
[water running]

50:19.937 --> 50:21.477
[sighs]

50:29.485 --> 50:31.235
[perfume spraying]

50:36.036 --> 50:37.576
[door opening]

50:44.795 --> 50:47.165
[footsteps padding softly]

50:50.592 --> 50:52.972
Oh, hey there, creeper.

50:53.178 --> 50:55.218
Hey, sorry.

50:55.681 --> 50:57.271
You look so good.

50:57.641 --> 50:59.351
Thanks. I have a surprise for you.

50:59.434 --> 51:00.734
Um, I knew we were running low

51:00.811 --> 51:02.981
and you're really into bourbon
these days, so...

51:04.439 --> 51:06.279
You really are the best, you know that?

51:06.358 --> 51:07.358
[Michael] Mm-hmm.

51:09.069 --> 51:11.779
- Can I buy you a drink, Mr. Holloway?
- Absolutely.

51:20.289 --> 51:21.709
You look like you had a fun night.

51:21.790 --> 51:24.080
Oh, it was fine.

51:24.877 --> 51:29.087
I mostly heard about Larin's dating life

51:29.173 --> 51:33.013
and Sasha's obsession with her patient,

51:33.093 --> 51:35.803
which is bordering on inappropriate.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.890
I'm sure you can help with that.

51:37.973 --> 51:39.563
Yeah, maybe.

51:41.101 --> 51:42.851
How was work? Did you eat?

51:42.933 --> 51:45.603
You know, ramen, at the desk.

51:46.106 --> 51:48.896
Oh, I hate to think of you eating alone.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.363
What is that?

51:55.365 --> 51:56.615
It's, uh...

51:56.700 --> 51:59.370
They stamped us on the way into the bar.

52:02.706 --> 52:06.076
Oh, must've been a pretty cool spot.

52:07.002 --> 52:08.302
It wasn't all that.

52:09.755 --> 52:13.585
Much happier here with this drink,

52:14.051 --> 52:15.391
this company.

52:24.394 --> 52:28.484
To the love of my life.

52:31.607 --> 52:32.607
Ditto.

52:35.531 --> 52:36.701
[glasses clinking]

52:43.327 --> 52:44.157
