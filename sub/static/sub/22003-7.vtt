12:42.583 --> 12:45.250
improve our benefits?

12:45.291 --> 12:48.875
-Sure, that too.

12:45.291 --> 12:48.875
-Gerry's got a point.

12:45.291 --> 12:48.875
-[Gerry]: Thank you.

12:48.917 --> 12:52.917
-So, Alex, I wanted to get

12:48.917 --> 12:52.917
together today to talk

12:48.917 --> 12:52.917
about a few things.

12:52.959 --> 12:55.667
-Alright, starting with

12:52.959 --> 12:55.667
the talking, I see.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.834
-Okay, so look.

12:57.875 --> 13:00.750
Even though I look a lot

12:57.875 --> 13:00.750
younger than your mom,

13:00.792 --> 13:03.458
I'm still very much a

13:00.792 --> 13:03.458
mother figure in your life.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.750
Do you understand what I'm

13:03.500 --> 13:05.750
saying?

13:05.792 --> 13:07.917
-Not at all.

13:07.959 --> 13:10.709
-Oh, what a lovely surprise!

13:07.959 --> 13:10.709
-[Simon]: Oooh. Hi.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.625
-Hey, you guys.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.625
-[Angela]: Hi.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.125
-Isn't this nice? Taking

13:12.667 --> 13:15.125
advantage of work-to-rule

13:15.166 --> 13:17.291
to spend time with the people

13:15.166 --> 13:17.291
we love?

13:17.333 --> 13:20.375
-[Laughs]: More like strolling-

13:17.333 --> 13:20.375
in-the-sunshine-to-rule,

13:17.333 --> 13:20.375
am I right?

13:20.417 --> 13:22.667
-[Alex laughs]: Yeah.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.667
-[Simon and Angela laugh]

13:22.709 --> 13:25.291
-Hey, look at us, we're like

13:22.709 --> 13:25.291
you two in the future.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.375
-[Laughs]: Yeah!

13:25.333 --> 13:27.375
-I don't think so...

13:27.417 --> 13:30.375
-Oh, ice cream dripping down

13:27.417 --> 13:30.375
my fingers.

13:30.417 --> 13:33.583
-Oh, hey, let me get that! Oh,

13:30.417 --> 13:33.583
no reason to waste good cream.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.750
-Oh yeah. No, no, we

13:33.625 --> 13:35.750
shouldn't waste it.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.000
-Mmm hmm. Oh, you got some

13:35.792 --> 13:38.000
cream in the crack there.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.625
-Yep, right in the...Perfect!

13:38.041 --> 13:40.625
Thank you!

13:40.667 --> 13:43.667
-Oh you're very welc...Oh,

13:40.667 --> 13:43.667
maple! Order envy! Order envy.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.250
-[Angela laughs]: Wait a

13:43.709 --> 13:46.250
minute mister!

13:43.709 --> 13:46.250
-[Simon]: Shoulda got maple.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.834
What's wrong?

13:46.291 --> 13:48.834
-You have schmutz on your face!

13:48.875 --> 13:51.000
-No I don't.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.000
-[Angela laughs]: You do!

13:51.041 --> 13:53.208
Do I have schmutz on my face?

13:51.041 --> 13:53.208
-Waste not, want not.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.959
-Come and get it.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.959
[Simon and Angela laugh]

13:56.000 --> 13:58.125
-Come and get it.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.125
[Simon and Angela laugh]

13:58.166 --> 14:00.500
-[Angela]: Isn't this delicious?

13:58.166 --> 14:00.500
-[Simon]: Mmm, it's good cream.

14:00.542 --> 14:03.750
-Oops, looks like you got a

14:00.542 --> 14:03.750
little drip there. I think I'll

14:00.542 --> 14:03.750
just...

14:03.792 --> 14:06.166
-No, no, no! Enough!

14:03.792 --> 14:06.166
Alex, no!

14:06.208 --> 14:09.959
Okay, look, I am your stepmother

14:06.208 --> 14:09.959
and you are my stepson.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.291
And the way that you've been

14:10.000 --> 14:13.291
acting is completely

14:10.000 --> 14:13.291
inappropriate.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.583
From now on there will be

14:13.333 --> 14:15.583
no more tight pants.

14:15.625 --> 14:18.667
There's not going to be any

14:15.625 --> 14:18.667
more whispering in my ear

14:15.625 --> 14:18.667
when I'm sleeping.

14:18.709 --> 14:21.792
And no more "accidental" pop-ins

14:18.709 --> 14:21.792
when I'm in the shower.

14:21.834 --> 14:26.041
And there certainly won't

14:21.834 --> 14:26.041
be any licking of anything!

14:26.083 --> 14:28.625
-Understood.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.625
-You are such a prude!

14:28.667 --> 14:31.583
-Yeah, you gotta loosen up,

14:28.667 --> 14:31.583
lady.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.583
-Yeah, really loosen up.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.709
-[Gerry]: Nobody came in

14:34.333 --> 14:36.709
before nine, right?

14:34.333 --> 14:36.709
-[Simon]: No.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.709
-Okay, perfect. Where are all

14:36.750 --> 14:39.709
the students?

14:39.750 --> 14:42.583
-Robert locked them out.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.583
-What?

14:42.625 --> 14:45.125
-With no teacher supervision

14:42.625 --> 14:45.125
under work-to-rule,

14:45.166 --> 14:47.500
the board deemed the school

14:45.166 --> 14:47.500
unsafe for students.

14:47.542 --> 14:50.667
-So, let me get this straight,

14:47.542 --> 14:50.667
there are no students right now,

14:50.709 --> 14:53.458
in the class I'm already late

14:50.709 --> 14:53.458
for.

14:50.709 --> 14:53.458
-Not-a-one. No.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.709
-What about my second period?

14:53.500 --> 14:55.709
-Second's same as the first.

14:55.750 --> 14:59.000
-Third period?

14:55.750 --> 14:59.000
-Yeah, it's sort of just

14:55.750 --> 14:59.000
a full day thing, Gerry.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.500
-[Simon sighs]: God knows

14:59.041 --> 15:01.500
when it will end.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.291
-And we're still getting paid?

15:01.542 --> 15:04.291
-Yeah, as long as we show up

15:01.542 --> 15:04.291
we get paid.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.208
-So, we're already doing the

15:04.333 --> 15:07.208
bare minimum, and now

15:04.333 --> 15:07.208
we're getting paid...

15:07.250 --> 15:09.417
And there's no students

15:07.250 --> 15:09.417
on top of that.

15:09.458 --> 15:12.583
-Yeah, but Gerry, I don't know

15:09.458 --> 15:12.583
if you're understanding the

15:09.458 --> 15:12.583
magnitude of the situation.

15:12.625 --> 15:16.625
-The biggest downside to

15:12.625 --> 15:16.625
being a teacher is the students!

15:16.667 --> 15:18.583
-This is perfect!

15:18.625 --> 15:21.792
-Excuse me, I can't bring

15:18.625 --> 15:21.792
her to work with me.

15:21.834 --> 15:23.709
What am I supposed to do

15:21.834 --> 15:23.709
with her now?

15:23.750 --> 15:26.625
-Ah, wish we could help,

15:23.750 --> 15:26.625
but we aren't the ones

15:23.750 --> 15:26.625
who locked out the kids.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.709
-[♪ Music]

15:26.667 --> 15:28.709
-Ugh! Mmmm!

15:30.792 --> 15:33.625
[♪ Music]

15:30.792 --> 15:33.625
-[Bill]: I gotta admit, this is

15:30.792 --> 15:33.625
a pretty sweet deal.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.875
-Isn't it? Look how good we're

15:33.667 --> 15:35.875
getting.

15:35.917 --> 15:38.208
-Are you positive you're getting

15:35.917 --> 15:38.208
paid?

15:38.250 --> 15:40.583
-Of course I'm positive.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.959
That's the best part,

15:40.625 --> 15:42.959
and there's no kids.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.458
Hey! I should see if I can

15:43.000 --> 15:45.458
get you a job here.

15:45.500 --> 15:49.125
We'll both get paid to play

15:45.500 --> 15:49.125
basketball forever.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.333
-I don't think you're gonna

15:49.166 --> 15:51.333
pull that off.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.667
-Of course I can pull it off.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.625
I'll just add it to our list

15:53.709 --> 15:55.625
of demands.

15:55.667 --> 15:58.583
'Cause I'll say, hey you don't

15:55.667 --> 15:58.583
hire Bill, we're staying on

15:55.667 --> 15:58.583
work-to-rule.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.750
-That makes no sense.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.041
But, just playing along with

16:00.792 --> 16:03.041
this scenario, what would I

16:00.792 --> 16:03.041
even teach?

16:03.083 --> 16:06.542
-You're missing the whole point,

16:03.083 --> 16:06.542
you don't have to teach

16:03.083 --> 16:06.542
anything. We just hang out.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.375
There's no kids here,

16:06.583 --> 16:09.375
yet we get paid!

16:09.417 --> 16:11.542
Don't ya get it?

16:09.417 --> 16:11.542
-I like it!

16:11.583 --> 16:14.417
-When do I get to shoot?

16:11.583 --> 16:14.417
-When I miss.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.542
-When you miss? Oh, that

16:14.458 --> 16:16.542
could be forever.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.500
Miss, miss, miss, miss,

16:17.667 --> 16:20.500
miss, miss, miss.

16:20.542 --> 16:22.750
-Oooh, not your day, buddy.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.333
-I didn't come to watch you

16:22.792 --> 16:25.333
shoot free throws all day.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.333
-I didn't miss.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.458
-While I get the ball for

16:25.375 --> 16:27.458
you every time.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.583
What's goin' on here?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.583
-Just signing contracts.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.333
-Excuse me?

16:29.625 --> 16:32.333
-I have yours right here, Gerry.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.250
Hello Bill.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.250
-Hey man.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.834
-I never agreed to any contract,

16:35.291 --> 16:37.834
what are you doing?

16:37.875 --> 16:39.792
-That may be true, but

16:37.875 --> 16:39.792
you know what?

16:39.834 --> 16:42.750
But I think the rest of the

16:39.834 --> 16:42.750
staff is actually quite anxious

16:39.834 --> 16:42.750
to get back to work.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.667
-Guys, stop! What are you doing?

16:42.792 --> 16:45.667
We're not signing anything.

16:45.709 --> 16:47.709
-The terms were actually

16:45.709 --> 16:47.709
quite reasonable.

16:47.750 --> 16:51.250
-All good things come to an

16:47.750 --> 16:51.250
end, but at least we got a

16:47.750 --> 16:51.250
raise, right?

16:51.291 --> 16:54.125
-That's right! And that's

16:51.291 --> 16:54.125
all your doing, hero-man.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.333
-Stop it.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.333
-Yeah, we got three percent!

16:56.375 --> 16:58.500
That's more than I've seen in

16:56.375 --> 16:58.500
years.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.667
-It's given me a new lease

16:58.542 --> 17:00.667
on life.

17:00.709 --> 17:03.458
-Three percent? Mine doesn't say

17:00.709 --> 17:03.458
three percent, mine says a

17:00.709 --> 17:03.458
quarter percent.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.125
Who else got three percent?

17:06.166 --> 17:08.750
[Gerry gasps]

17:08.792 --> 17:11.875
I'm not doin' this for a quarter

17:08.792 --> 17:11.875
percent raise. No way! No way!

17:14.625 --> 17:17.959
We are going back on

17:14.625 --> 17:17.959
work-to-rule, right now!

17:18.000 --> 17:19.959
Everyone of us! Except you.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.750
Right now, work-to-rule,

17:20.000 --> 17:24.750
no kids for a whole year!

17:24.792 --> 17:26.583
Watch us.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.792
-You know the thing about

17:26.625 --> 17:28.792
power in numbers is that...

17:28.834 --> 17:30.959
There isn't that much power

17:28.834 --> 17:30.959
when there aren't any numbers.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.792
You know what I think, Gerry?

17:31.000 --> 17:35.792
I think thumb-one should

17:31.000 --> 17:35.792
get the hell out of here!

17:35.834 --> 17:37.875
-Yeah.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.834
Makes sense.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.834
-This is 'cause of you.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.875
Simon, can I have some of

17:39.875 --> 17:42.875
your raise? We could split it.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.834
-What's that? What? Hmm?

17:44.875 --> 17:48.208
-Just do a...A email,

17:44.875 --> 17:48.208
wire transfer.

17:44.875 --> 17:48.208
-Huh? What?

17:48.250 --> 17:52.125
-Yeah, every pay cheque,

17:48.250 --> 17:52.125
just email me some money.

17:52.166 --> 17:55.583
-[Alex]: See ya.

17:52.166 --> 17:55.583
-[Lisa]: Hey, do you need help

17:52.166 --> 17:55.583
with your backpack?

17:55.625 --> 17:58.250
-[Alex]: No. I've got it.

17:55.625 --> 17:58.250
-[Lisa]: Wait, Alex!

17:58.291 --> 18:01.667
Hang on. Have a good day!

17:58.291 --> 18:01.667
-No, just stop.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.250
-Alex, you can still hug

18:01.709 --> 18:04.250
your stepmom.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.709
-What if it's a gateway hug?

18:04.291 --> 18:07.709
-I kind of think you're being

18:04.291 --> 18:07.709
a little overdramatic here.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.709
-Sorry, I wouldn't want to make

18:07.750 --> 18:10.709
anything "inappropriate."

18:10.750 --> 18:13.458
Just....Handshake will do.
