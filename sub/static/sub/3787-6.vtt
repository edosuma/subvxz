Okay, Max.

00:03.938 --> 00:05.404
How would you describe
our apartment?

00:05.406 --> 00:07.072
And I've already ruled out

00:07.074 --> 00:10.376
"worse than that girl-pit
in<i> silence of the lambs."</i>

00:10.378 --> 00:14.046
Well, at least she had some
silence once in awhile.

to rent this dump.

on airbnb.

So let's start lying.

00:29.130 --> 00:33.132
This is a fantastic idea
and I really want to do this.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.567
First question:
"Describe your neighborhood."

Pet-friendly.

live there?"

00:46.614 --> 00:49.715

across the hall

when he's drunk.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.766
Always, sometimes, one time."

01:07.768 --> 01:09.902

01:09.904 --> 01:12.004

01:38.132 --> 01:40.699
We rented our apartment
on airbnb.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.368
You rented to arabs?

01:43.370 --> 01:46.438
Well, good luck
getting it back.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.775
They tend to be
a tad territorial.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.078
Airbnb is an agency
that rents to out-of-towners

01:53.080 --> 01:56.215
and I'm guessing local men
cheating on their wives.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.916
Well, I did it.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.318

We have three offers
for our apartment.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.493
How?

02:07.495 --> 02:08.627
Let me rephrase that.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.130
How!

02:11.132 --> 02:13.298
I found the perfect
sales pitch.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.635
"Stay at the place
where dreams die"?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.571
"Have the authentic
williamsburg experience."

02:19.573 --> 02:21.740
Oh, you mean getting clumsily
felt up

02:21.742 --> 02:25.144
by a guy who looks like he came
from the gold rush?

02:25.146 --> 02:26.845
Anyone can stay at a hotel.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.181
But how often can you say
you went to New York

02:29.183 --> 02:33.118

who gets our apartment.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.095
A guy looking to get away
from it all.

02:43.097 --> 02:46.131

10:54.554 --> 10:56.421
Max!

10:56.423 --> 10:57.389
What? This one's
on it's last legs.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.357
Last night I heard it coughing.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.992
Could also use some new
underwear.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.261
Mine are running on fumes.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.829
I just texted David.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.431
He's coming.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.566
This is going to be
an amazing party.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.768
Party?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:09.770 --> 11:11.102
We're having some
friends over.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.103
Cool.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.839
Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.909
And like Max said, "cool!"

11:17.911 --> 11:19.511
Jeez, pull it back.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.679
You're acting needier
than Sofia vergara

11:20.681 --> 11:24.683
on a red carpet.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.251
Big fan.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.920
Big, big fan.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.522
Compliments of the chef.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.525
My specialty, popsicles.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.960
I find they taste best
when sucked slowly,

11:35.962 --> 11:39.330
using plenty of tongue,
facing the kitchen.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.572
I can't believe
we're not invited

11:47.574 --> 11:48.840
to the biggest party
in our apartment

11:48.842 --> 11:51.943
since those ants found
your jelly beans.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.179
Yoo-hoo!

11:54.181 --> 11:57.348
Hi, so we're just up here
hangin' out.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.884
Doin' our thang.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.720
(Lily)
Oh, sorry, girl.
Did we wake you?

12:01.722 --> 12:06.257
Go back to sleep.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.726
"Go back to sleep"?

12:07.728 --> 12:09.360
Why does she think
we're so lame?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.296
Um, I don't know.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.964
Maybe it's 'cause you're
throwing around words

12:12.966 --> 12:17.102
like "yoo-hoo" and "thang,"
like a mom bringing cheetos

12:17.104 --> 12:19.370
down to a slumber party.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.905
This is your fault.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.640
They were obsessed with us
until you started asking

12:22.642 --> 12:28.413
for bras like some bra-less
homeless person.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.915
We're never gonna sleep
with all that music.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.084
Check the drawer,
Sophie must have ear plugs.

12:33.086 --> 12:37.388
I mean, she lives upstairs
from you.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.658
I found plugs, but I don't think
they're for your ears.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.232
It's fine, we'll just pop
downstairs and say hello.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.234
Fashion's my scene.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.870
Know what I'm seeing?
That price tag.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.639
Oh, tuck it back in,
I have to return it.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.541
Okay.
Remember our deal.

12:56.543 --> 13:01.045
I got up and got dressed
so you're my slave for life.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.014
Oh, hi, girls.

13:03.016 --> 13:06.384
I thought you were the man
with the Greek food.

13:06.386 --> 13:10.221
Wow, I have definitely got to
start waxing my upper lip more.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.323
Sophie, why aren't you
in Vermont?

13:12.325 --> 13:14.559
Oh, I lied.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.327
I didn't go to Vermont.

13:16.329 --> 13:20.365
I mean, it's far
and I'm not a lesbian.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.034
No, I stayed in town
to spy on Oleg.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.536
I mean, I know you girls think
that I'm perfect,

13:24.538 --> 13:28.339
but I have trust issues.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.808
Well then, whose apartment
is that?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.543
I'm staying at Jim's.

13:31.545 --> 13:32.977
Straight Jim's or gay Jim's?

13:32.979 --> 13:36.881
Sophie, you forgot your purse.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.017
Oh, I think this is mine.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.586
Just kidding, it's yours.

13:41.588 --> 13:45.123
What's up, salt n' pepa?

13:45.125 --> 13:48.493
(Both)
Gay Jim's.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.764
Oh, girls, please don't tell
Oleg that I'm here.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.432
You know, I've been following
him around

13:54.434 --> 13:56.568
to see what he would do
if I was not in town.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.403
And so far, you know,
he's been cool.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.772
But you know the old saying:

14:00.774 --> 14:03.508
"Cheat on me once,
shame on you.

14:03.510 --> 14:08.546
Cheat on me twice,
your balls are in a jar."

14:11.083 --> 14:13.751
Oh, my god! There's a man
standing in our doorway.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.820
I have a doorman again.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.088
Weird to see a man
standing in our doorway

14:17.090 --> 14:18.890
without a warrant,
an eviction notice,

14:18.892 --> 14:20.658
or a Bible.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.694
Excuse me, this is our
apartment.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.195
Yeah, we live here
all the time.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.663
No biggie.

14:25.665 --> 14:29.667
No biggie, and no electricity,
no lease-y.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.135
Hi, I'm Caroline.
This is Max.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.370
We live here.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.305
Not according to the list.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.841
Sir, look, we do live her.
I have a key.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.344
The key is to be on the list,
which you are not.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.347
Okay, I can prove we live here.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.016
Go over to the window,
kick the side of radiator,

14:45.018 --> 14:47.051
a panel will open up.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.988
You'll find a half-smoked joint
and another half-smoked joint.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.489
Proving--

14:51.491 --> 14:53.157
what? That you're a poor
pot head?

14:53.159 --> 14:55.093
This is crazy.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.394
I can't believe I'm begging
to get into a place

14:56.396 --> 14:57.629
I've been trying to get out of.

14:57.631 --> 14:58.763
It's a very exclusive party.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.164
It's a dump.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.600
I should know.
I live here.

15:06.105 --> 15:10.441
(Caroline)
This night couldn't get any
worse.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.277
Turn that light off.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.811
I'm watching the Victoria's
secret super model party

15:13.813 --> 15:16.514
with my night vision goggles.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.816
And updating.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.718
Oleg, how did you get in here?

15:20.720 --> 15:21.953
How do you think?

15:21.955 --> 15:23.121
It's my girlfriend's apartment.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.890
I broke in.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.559
Yes, Oleg, it's your
girlfriend's apartment

15:28.561 --> 15:30.295
where you're sitting
in the dark,

15:30.297 --> 15:32.363
watching models out the window
with night vision goggles.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.233
Hey!
My pants are on!

15:35.235 --> 15:38.036
No, they are not!

15:38.038 --> 15:39.871
Not my fault.

15:39.873 --> 15:42.040
Five Victoria's secret
super models downstairs?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.676
They took themselves off.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.512
So what are you saying?
You're the victim here?

15:47.514 --> 15:48.846
What would Sophie say
if she came home

15:48.848 --> 15:50.381
and saw you sitting here?

15:50.383 --> 15:53.451
She'd say,
"stop hogging the goggles."

15:53.453 --> 15:55.620
Oleg, let me just say this:

15:55.622 --> 15:57.855
Vermont is closer than you
think.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.557
I don't know where
this argument is going,

15:59.559 --> 16:01.626
but I'm going to that damn
supermodel party.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.296
Oleg, it's late, I'm gonna
lay this on the line for you.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.965
You're no George Clooney.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.101
You're not even George Costanza.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.869
These sheets are amazing

16:11.871 --> 16:14.539
and you are never gonna do
better than Sophie.

16:14.541 --> 16:19.177
She is hot and clearly
has no sense of smell.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.178
I love Sophie.

16:20.180 --> 16:24.315
I'll go home.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.817
On second thought,
I don't trust myself

16:25.819 --> 16:27.218
to walk by your apartment.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.021
Better lock me in here.

16:30.023 --> 16:33.091
(Lily)
Caroline! Max!
Come down here! Hurry!

16:33.093 --> 16:34.359
I knew it! See, Max?

16:34.361 --> 16:35.460
They're begging us to come.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.928
I'm back again.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.296
Are you coming?

16:38.298 --> 16:39.797
Oh, let me think.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.165
Downstairs with an open bar
or up here,

16:41.167 --> 16:44.335
alone, with Oleg
in his tighty-not-that-whities?

16:47.606 --> 16:49.374
Should we tie you up?

16:49.376 --> 16:52.877
No, it'll just make me hornier.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.385
I knew they wanted us
to come to the party!

17:00.387 --> 17:01.819
How could they not?

17:01.821 --> 17:03.688
Last night I taught
Petra how to eat bread

17:03.690 --> 17:06.858
without tearing it
into little pieces first.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.460
don't try it.
I was a Navy seal.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.795
You think you're tough?

17:10.797 --> 17:12.930
I lived in a refrigerator box
for a month.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.399
With no top.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.135
Not the box.
Me.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.936
<i>(Lily)</i>
<i>Max, Caroline, get in here!</i>

17:18.938 --> 17:21.172
Hey! See we were invited.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.142
'Cause we're "a" list.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.578
The toilet is clogged and I need
you to take care of it, please.

17:29.415 --> 17:33.951
"A list" as in "a" janitor list.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.286
I don't know what to do.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.155
Can one of you call
the concierge?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.357
Sure. Caroline!

17:39.359 --> 17:41.325
Wait, wait, wait--
you didn't just call us

17:41.327 --> 17:42.460
down here 'cause the toilet's
clogged, did you?

17:42.462 --> 17:43.461
No.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.762
Okay, good.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.531
The kitchen sink
is backed up, too.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.366
But, toilet, I got this.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.201
I was almost born in one.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.037
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.239
All right, everyone just calm
down.

17:55.241 --> 18:00.344
No need to overreact.

18:02.347 --> 18:05.817
And there's the pool
we mentioned in our ad.

18:05.819 --> 18:06.851
Oh, boy.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.887
Yup, we got some floaters.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.155
Caroline, I'm gonna need
the plunger

18:11.157 --> 18:13.124
and a lobotomy.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.259
This happens with vintage
toilets.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.929
Part of their old-world charm.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.265
We got some charm
stuck on your loofah.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.567
Hey guys, remember last night

18:22.569 --> 18:23.734
how we just bit
into that bread

18:23.736 --> 18:27.638
without chewing it?
Good times.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.442
I need that damn plunger,
I don't want to die this way.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.246
Got it,
but it's caught on something.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.115
[Grunts]

18:37.117 --> 18:39.851
[Screaming]

18:44.289 --> 18:46.057
What kind of a dump is this?

18:46.059 --> 18:49.060
Hey! You wanted the williamsburg
experience, this is it!

18:57.703 --> 18:59.570
Good news, Martha.
I have your flat iron

18:59.572 --> 19:02.173
looking pretty much
back to normal.

19:02.175 --> 19:06.110
Oh, that's good.
Keep it.

19:06.112 --> 19:10.148
Again, sorry about your cashmere
sweaters in here.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.816
But when we ran out
of paper towels,

19:11.818 --> 19:15.953
you did scream, "just use
anything, make it stop."

19:15.955 --> 19:18.523
And of course, we'll pay
to have them all dry cleaned.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.926
Oh, that's nice.
Keep them.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.961
Okay, we can leave.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.265
I am off the phone
with my therapist.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.267
And it goes without saying,
we won't charge you guys

19:29.269 --> 19:30.468
for this weekend.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.537
No way.
Here.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.940
You are taking this check
and my therapist's phone number.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.142
I do not know how you are
standing up without him.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.278
What? Come on,
this is nothing.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.881
One month, the floor actually
opened up and swallowed us.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.816
Yeah, we've been through worse.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.586
Oh, it's really cool the way
you two support each other.

19:48.588 --> 19:52.390
Yup, we're a pair
of support hose.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.959
And speaking of support--

19:54.961 --> 19:55.993
here, Max.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.762
No way!

19:57.764 --> 20:00.264
Look, Caroline,
it's a bra-nanza!

20:00.266 --> 20:05.570
And, Caroline, since you don't
really need to wear a bra...

20:05.572 --> 20:07.371
Here.
This apartment may be hell,

20:07.373 --> 20:10.074
but you are a real angel.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.577
Aw, my own wings?

20:12.579 --> 20:15.079
Thank you, guys.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.981
Hey, can I ask you something?

20:16.983 --> 20:21.285
As long as it doesn't have
anything to do with rats.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.920
How come you didn't invite us
to the party?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.755
What? I thought Martha did.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.657
I thought Lily did.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.026
(Both)
Model moment!

20:32.531 --> 20:34.498
Pick-up, Caroline!

20:38.770 --> 20:40.638
Yup, I always knew
you would die here.

20:45.043 --> 20:49.113
Pick-up, Max!

20:49.115 --> 20:51.349
Looking good, Max.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.184
After you drop that,
have Caroline come back here

20:53.186 --> 20:56.153
and lock me in the walk-in
till Sophie gets home.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.656
Max, I just realized we're kind
of the supermodels

20:58.658 --> 21:00.524
of waitressing.
