WEBVTT

00:08.875 --> 00:09.876
Daphne.

00:09.876 --> 00:10.943
Hey.
Hello.

00:10.943 --> 00:13.313
I though you were spending
the afternoon with Dad.

00:13.313 --> 00:15.148
He's in the loo.
Why don't you join us?

00:15.148 --> 00:16.082
All right.
Thank you.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.450
Hey, did you happen
to catch the show today?

00:17.450 --> 00:19.986
I was on fire. First caller
was an agoraphobic--

00:19.986 --> 00:21.955
boom! Knocked it
right out of the park.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.957
Then two troubled marriages
and a compulsive overeater--

00:23.957 --> 00:26.960
boom, boom! Boom!

00:26.960 --> 00:29.929
I was a regular mental health
dispensing machine.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.965
I did two loads of laundry

00:31.965 --> 00:34.434
and cut a piece of gum
out of Eddie's hair.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.835
Now, Daphne, don't
get down on yourself.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.404
The work you do at home
is very important.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.405
In fact, I don't know what

00:38.405 --> 00:40.206
Dad and I are going to do
once you're married.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.474
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.475
That makes me feel better.

00:42.475 --> 00:46.813
Boom! Boy, there is
no "off" switch on this thing.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.615
Sadly, that's true.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.051
Oh, there she is,
the other half of our team.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
Roz, are you still
as jazzed as I am?

00:53.053 --> 00:54.921
They're taking us
off the air.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.057
What? Since when?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.592
While you were looking for
Gatorade to pour over yourself,

00:59.592 --> 01:01.694
Kenny came by and said
he's yanking us for a week.

01:01.694 --> 01:02.962
He wants to try out
that new show--

01:02.962 --> 01:05.465
you know, Car Chat
with Bob and Bethany.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.400
Car Chat with Bob and Bethany?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.902
What the...?

01:08.902 --> 01:12.238
Oh... touche, Kenny.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.840
You are indeed

01:13.840 --> 01:15.608
a worthy adversary,

01:15.608 --> 01:19.913
but you shall find I have
a trick or two of my own.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.147
You know,
Dr. Crane,

01:21.147 --> 01:22.615
maybe a week off
would do you some good.

01:22.615 --> 01:23.650
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.051
You see, I'm actually

01:25.051 --> 01:26.119
renegotiating
my contract right now

01:26.119 --> 01:27.620
and this is merely
the station's tactic

01:27.620 --> 01:29.022
to try to get me to cave.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.390
I hope you're right.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.958
Of course I'm right.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.927
Bob and Bethany, Car Chat.
Please.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.862
How can anybody drone on
for three hours

01:35.862 --> 01:37.864
about a subject
that nobody even understands?

01:37.864 --> 01:39.833
Yeah, we were there first.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.267
Don't worry,
Dr. Crane.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.337
I'm sure you're right
about these things.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.805
After all, you
usually are.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.307
Why, thank you, Daphne.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.641
That's exactly
what I needed to hear.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.276
Boom.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.444
(laughing)

01:51.444 --> 01:52.846
Son.
Oh, hi, Dad.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.915
Boy, they really did a job
in the men's room, didn't they?

01:55.915 --> 01:56.883
Why, I hadn't noticed.

01:57.417 --> 01:58.918
Oh, yeah,
completely redid it.

01:58.918 --> 02:00.386
Fancy wallpapers,

02:00.386 --> 02:02.789
bright new tile,
even those little perfumed soaps

02:02.789 --> 02:04.324
that you like to use
at home, Fras.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.692
DAPHNE:
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

02:05.692 --> 02:09.461
You went into the ladies room,
you blind old sod.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.266
I've been begging him
for months to get glasses.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.702
Ladies room? You're crazy.
That guy was just in there.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.772
Oh, hi, Bethany.
Uh, listen.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.541
Good luck in the slot next week.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.376
BETHANY:
Thanks. We're pumped.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.480
Granted, Dad, Bethany
may be a bit of a tough call,

02:27.480 --> 02:30.250
but still, you know, it wouldn't
hurt to get a checkup.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.018
Oh, come on,
don't you start, too.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.520
There's nothing
wrong with my eyes.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.522
Now, if you don't mind,
I just want

02:35.522 --> 02:37.023
to sit here quietly,
and have an...

02:39.492 --> 02:40.760
...have a drink of cream.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.029
Do you have a problem with that?

02:50.069 --> 02:51.504
Hello, Dr. Crane.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.907
Oh. Hello, Daphne.

02:53.907 --> 02:57.410
Say, you know, my agent Bebe
said she might be stopping by.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.912
Have you heard anything?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.780
No. And I hope she's
not staying for lunch.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.950
I'm afraid we're
fresh out of live mice.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.392
Hey, Fras.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.193
Dad.

03:19.098 --> 03:23.970
Is it my imagination,
or are those ladies glasses?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.406
Yes, and don't you
say anything.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.408
I had to drag him
down to the store.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.909
He tried on every pair
in the place.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.811
Those were
the only ones he liked.

03:38.651 --> 03:41.588
So.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.924
How do you like the new specs?

03:44.924 --> 03:46.859
They certainly
are eye-catching.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.194
Yeah.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.430
You should have seen the looks
I got all day.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.298
Mostly from women.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.234
You know, I'd like
to think it was me,

03:54.234 --> 03:56.236
but I got an idea
these frames were designed

03:56.236 --> 03:59.672
with an eye
to pleasing the ladies.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.574
I'd say that's
a safe assumption.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.976
Daph, have
you seen

04:02.976 --> 04:03.910
the case for them?

04:03.910 --> 04:05.812
I don't know what I did with it.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.714
Yeah, I think
I popped them into my purse.

04:07.714 --> 04:08.715
Check my room.
Okeydoke.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.717
Oh, wait'll you see
this case, Fras.

04:10.717 --> 04:14.587
This Lauren guy really knows
what he's doing.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.755
Ralph Lauren?

04:15.755 --> 04:17.457
Sophia.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.029
I'm amazed you can keep
a straight face all day.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.530
(doorbell ringing)

04:24.530 --> 04:27.033
I've done enough clothes
shopping with your father.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.535
I'm pretty good
at pretending to like things

04:29.535 --> 04:32.038
no matter how horrifying
I find them.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.373
Bebe.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.708
How nice to see you.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.712
Frasier, my favorite client.

04:39.712 --> 04:42.715
Seattle's golden-throated gift
to the airwaves.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.585
I take it negotiations
aren't going so well.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.053
You remember
that insulting figure

04:47.053 --> 04:48.054
you said
you'd never accept?

04:48.554 --> 04:49.555
They haven't
come up to it yet.

04:49.555 --> 04:50.490
Oh, dear.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.191
NILES:
Knock, knock.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.826
Oh, come on
in, Niles.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.128
Bebe's just bringing
me up to speed

04:55.128 --> 04:57.630
on the depressing news about
my contract negotiations.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.132
Don't worry, dear.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.534
I just need to find a way
to throw a scare into them.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.737
Have you tried
turning into a bat?

05:04.737 --> 05:07.006
I would, love,
but most grown men

05:07.006 --> 05:09.976
don't share your fear
of tiny creatures.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.748
Could you two
please catch up later?

05:15.748 --> 05:17.183
I did get one offer

05:17.183 --> 05:20.219
that I thought
might give us some leverage.

05:20.219 --> 05:21.621
It's a TV job.

05:21.621 --> 05:22.522
Television?

05:22.522 --> 05:23.956
Unfortunately,
it's all wrong for you.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.226
They want you and Roz to host
A.M. Seattle next week.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.028
That vapid morning chat show?

05:29.028 --> 05:30.563
Exactly
what I told them.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.565
Frasier Crane is a doctor.

05:32.565 --> 05:35.068
He heals the masses;
he doesn't pander to them.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.536
He's not going to do some

05:36.536 --> 05:37.870
silly morning
kaffeeklatsch

05:37.870 --> 05:39.872
no matter how
fabulously popular it is.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.240
Well, that's
quite right, Bebe.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.942
That sort of show is beneath me.

05:42.942 --> 05:43.810
Exactly.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.078
It's undignified.
Horribly.

05:45.078 --> 05:45.845
Still...

05:45.845 --> 05:47.814
I'm listening.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.248
If there were a way to do it

05:49.248 --> 05:51.184
with a bit more dignity,
some polish and substance.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.518
Why didn't I think of that?

05:52.518 --> 05:55.788
You know, a dash of high society
and a dollop of culture.

05:55.788 --> 05:58.491
I can't believe
you're even considering this.

05:58.491 --> 05:59.559
The show
is nothing more

05:59.559 --> 06:00.827
than a melange of bad jokes

06:01.327 --> 06:02.628
and mind-numbing banter.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.430
Yes, but it doesn't have to be,
Niles, don't you see?

06:04.430 --> 06:06.265
If I could choose
the guests myself.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.500
You can.
And control the content.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.835
You could.
Well, then I'd accept.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.570
We did. I mean, we will.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.373
In fact, why don't I call

06:13.373 --> 06:16.743
them right now
with the exciting news.

06:16.743 --> 06:17.710
(chuckling)

06:17.710 --> 06:19.178
May I?

06:19.178 --> 06:20.947
On the balcony,
if you don't mind.

06:20.947 --> 06:21.848
Mind?

06:21.848 --> 06:24.350
I don't want a single puff

06:24.350 --> 06:27.353
tearing up the baby blues
of TV's newest sensation.

06:27.353 --> 06:29.088
By this time next week...
You heard him--

06:29.088 --> 06:32.458
If you're going to blow smoke,
do it on the balcony.

06:36.696 --> 06:39.065
Well, I can't say
I'm surprised.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.933
What is that supposed to mean?

06:40.933 --> 06:42.902
Only that something like this
was inevitable.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.404
It's the final step
in your descent

06:44.404 --> 06:47.840
from legitimate psychiatrist
to dancing bear.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.242
Niles, we are
talking about doing

06:49.742 --> 06:51.778
a sophisticated television show
for one week

06:51.778 --> 06:54.046
in order to improve
my contract negotiations.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.315
This has nothing to do with
your contract negotiations.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.817
You have been an applause junkie

06:57.817 --> 07:00.186
ever since you first set foot
on a grammar school stage.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.088
I was drawn to the theater

07:02.088 --> 07:04.991
because of its discipline
and collaborative spirit.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.392
Oh, please.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.928
In your sixth-grade production
of Oklahoma,

07:08.928 --> 07:11.931
you took so many curtain calls,
Mrs. Van Raaphorst

07:11.931 --> 07:14.801
had to lasso you
and pull you from the stage.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.136
That woman never understood
me or the role

07:17.136 --> 07:19.439
of farmer number three.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.177
Oh, I'm just wasting my breath.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.045
As usual, you have fallen
under the spell

07:26.045 --> 07:27.013
of that sorceress
out there.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.514
I have done
no such thing.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.049
And I wish you'd
just lay off of Bebe.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.050
She is not some
malign witch

07:31.050 --> 07:32.485
who can transform
people at will.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.922
I can't find a damn thing
in this purse.

07:41.327 --> 07:42.829
If I say I'm sorry,

07:43.329 --> 07:45.832
will she change Dad
back into a man?

07:49.268 --> 07:50.837
Well, it took several
of your best people,

07:50.837 --> 07:52.338
but I believe
they've finally wrestled

07:52.338 --> 07:54.340
this feisty cowlick
of mine into submission.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.776
So, are we, uh, ready to roll?

07:56.776 --> 07:59.011
Not quite.
Your partner's not here.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.279
Roz is not here?

08:00.279 --> 08:02.248
But we are on in four minutes.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.183
At this point,
a rerun is on in four minutes.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.451
Don't worry, Matt,
she'll be here.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.086
We won't have time
to put her through makeup.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.454
A natural beauty like Roz?

08:08.454 --> 08:09.956
Oh, please, darling.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.891
Pinch her cheek, stand back
and watch her glow.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.793
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Roz.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.695
Oh, for God's sake,
you look awful.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.663
Are you sick?
No. Of course not.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.664
I wouldn't be sick
for our big debut.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.099
I'm totally fine.

08:20.099 --> 08:21.334
Roz, you're burning up.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.668
Well, it's kind of hot in here.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.170
Maybe it's all these lights.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.671
I'll just get this jacket off.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.607
No, no. Roz, Roz.
Stop, stop, stop.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.008
She's delirious.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.511
With anticipation,
darling. Don't worry.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.511
I'll calm her down.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.013
Pull yourself together,

08:34.013 --> 08:35.481
you hear me,
we need this show!

08:35.481 --> 08:36.948
All right, everyone
we're doing a rerun.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.683
Let the audience go,
cue the tapes.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.886
Wait. Can't Frasier
do the show without her?

08:40.886 --> 08:42.221
This is a chat show.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.623
Who's he going to chat with?

08:43.623 --> 08:45.057
Me. I'll go on with him.

08:45.057 --> 08:45.958
You?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.728
Pull yourself
together, Roz!

08:48.728 --> 08:50.062
I don't think so, Bebe.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.464
Why not? All he
needs is someone

08:51.464 --> 08:53.866
to suck up to him,
laugh at his jokes,

08:53.866 --> 08:55.368
pretend to listen
to his stories.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.304
I'm his agent; for God's sake,
that's what I do.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.573
You know, I believe
she could pull it off.

09:00.573 --> 09:02.241
The problem is,
she needs to be likable.

09:02.241 --> 09:05.044
Right. Do I at least
get to keep the suit?

09:05.044 --> 09:07.313
Hold on.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.614
I can be likable.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.950
I can also be very unlikable.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.251
Maybe if you explained
the difference

09:12.251 --> 09:13.219
to poor, confused Bebe.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.254
For instance, what you were
doing in the dressing room

09:15.755 --> 09:17.189
with the wardrobe girl
an hour ago--

09:17.189 --> 09:21.093
would your wife find that
likable or unlikable?

09:21.093 --> 09:23.663
Could you put some makeup
on this woman now?

09:23.663 --> 09:25.565
Okay, folks.
60 seconds.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.066
All right, Bebe,
just follow my lead.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.570
I'll introduce us and then we'll
get to our guests, all right?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.572
Now, wasn't our first guest
Susan Sontag?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.839
Oh, she had a conflict.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.875
Don't worry.
We got a fabulous replacement.

09:35.875 --> 09:39.679
"Baby Leo, the world's biggest
two-year-old"?

09:39.679 --> 09:41.614
You're going to love him.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.616
Just remember
to lift with your legs.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.485
That's it. This
is unacceptable.

09:46.485 --> 09:49.155
Oh, now who's
the world's biggest baby?

09:49.155 --> 09:50.523
I will not do this show!
We're live in five,

09:50.523 --> 09:53.526
four, three, two...

09:53.526 --> 09:55.027
(theme music plays)

09:55.027 --> 09:57.530
Hi. Welcome
to A.M. Seattle.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.532
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

09:59.532 --> 10:00.533
And I'm Bebe Glazer.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.500
We're going to be
your hosts this week

10:01.500 --> 10:02.535
and believe me,
we've got

10:02.535 --> 10:05.538
some great shows
lined up for you.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.039
But before we get
to our guests,

10:07.540 --> 10:09.842
I'd like to take a few
moments to share with you

10:09.842 --> 10:12.545
a few thoughts
I've prepared

10:12.545 --> 10:14.680
on a very special
time of the day--

10:14.680 --> 10:17.016
the time that we'll be
spending together--

10:17.016 --> 10:18.417
Morning.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.920
A new beginning.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.322
A daily rebirth,
if you will.

10:23.322 --> 10:24.724
What the hell is this?

10:24.724 --> 10:26.125
Banter. Banter.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.160
And even though
"A.M." stands for

10:28.160 --> 10:29.562
"ante meridian,"

10:29.562 --> 10:31.464
if you simply put them together,

10:31.464 --> 10:35.835
they also make up the word "am,"
as in, "I am."

10:35.835 --> 10:37.136
Whoa.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.273
Not before my coffee.

10:41.273 --> 10:45.645
As you can see, Frasier
has a way with words

10:45.645 --> 10:49.448
but did you also know
that he has a way with voices?

10:49.448 --> 10:50.716
Excuse me?

10:50.716 --> 10:52.084
Who wants to hear Frasier's

10:52.551 --> 10:54.086
famous Sean Connery impression?

10:54.086 --> 10:57.023
(applause and cheering)

11:02.628 --> 11:04.630
(imitating Sean Connery):
Now, now, Moneypenny,

11:05.131 --> 11:06.932
you're embarrassing me.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.201
(laughing)

11:12.838 --> 11:15.641
Dr. Frasier Crane,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.878
Any more impressions, Frasier?

11:18.878 --> 11:20.012
Maybe I should just...

11:20.012 --> 11:21.347
Now, don't be shy.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.350
Who wants to hear Frasier
do more impressions?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.718
(applause and cheering)

11:27.420 --> 11:28.754
It's just that I'd hate

11:28.754 --> 11:30.256
to take time away
from our other guests.

11:30.256 --> 11:31.724
I-I believe that...

11:31.724 --> 11:35.494
(imitating James Mason): James Mason
may be stopping by to visit today.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.296
(laughing)

11:37.296 --> 11:38.264
Oh, yes!

11:40.000 --> 11:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:49.208 --> 11:51.210
This has been
some week.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.211
It's really flown by.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.546
Hasn't it?

11:53.546 --> 11:54.447
Whoosh.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.448
A whoosh.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.949
I can't believe
it's time

11:56.949 --> 11:57.950
for Thursday's
Kitchen Corner.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.420
We'll be right back
with Chef Frasier.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.723
Hang tight.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.524
STAGE MANAGER:
And we're clear.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.694
Bebe, Kitchen Corner?

12:08.694 --> 12:11.197
I thought we had
the violin prodigy up next.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.532
For God's sake, we bumped
Kim Lee twice this week.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.834
I know, but we're running
short of time,

12:14.834 --> 12:17.103
and the cooking segment
is gonna be boffo.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.838
Well, all right, but I insist

12:18.838 --> 12:20.239
Kim Lee play over
the closing credits.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.741
All right?
We're not running

12:21.741 --> 12:23.743
some sort of a tacky run-
of-the-mill morning show.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.244
Here's your chef's costume.
Thank you.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.246
Allow me, dear.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.050
You know, Frasier.
Hmm?

12:31.050 --> 12:32.351
The most magical thing
happened to me

12:32.351 --> 12:33.853
last night during dinner.

12:33.853 --> 12:34.854
Really?

12:34.854 --> 12:36.322
I was recognized.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.724
It's intoxicating,
isn't it?

12:38.724 --> 12:40.926
Gosh, I myself,

12:40.926 --> 12:42.194
no stranger
to celebrity,

12:42.194 --> 12:43.696
have noticed
more heads

12:43.696 --> 12:44.697
swiveling
in my direction.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.698
Ooh.

12:45.698 --> 12:46.665
(chuckles)

12:46.665 --> 12:50.202
STAGE MANAGER:
We're back in five, four,

12:50.202 --> 12:51.604
three, two...

12:51.604 --> 12:52.471
Welcome back.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.473
Frasier, I hear you're
quite the gourmet.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.474
Oh, please.

12:55.474 --> 12:56.909
I don't do
anything fancy.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.478
A few soufflés,
a flambé or two.

12:59.478 --> 13:00.980
Just good eats.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.982
Now, this morning,
I'm going to be making

13:02.982 --> 13:04.483
my signature
breakfast for you--

13:04.483 --> 13:06.318
that's Eggs
Palermo Fontana.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.120
Mmm. Makes
my mouth water.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.122
But before we start,

13:10.122 --> 13:11.624
I have a little
sweetheart backstage

13:11.624 --> 13:13.626
who's dying to come out
and give you a hand.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.127
Is it Kim Lee?

13:15.127 --> 13:16.128
Not even close.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.464
It's Bobo,
the cooking chimp.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.236
Oh, that's very funny.

13:24.236 --> 13:27.573
This has Matt's
fingerprints all over it.

13:28.874 --> 13:29.809
We thought

13:29.809 --> 13:30.776
it might be great fun

13:30.776 --> 13:32.711
if you were to match
your skills against his.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.181
FRASIER: Well, I don't know,
Bebe, uh...

13:35.181 --> 13:37.116
Well, let's let
the audience decide.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.117
How many of you

13:38.117 --> 13:39.618
want to see the
monkey make eggs?

13:39.618 --> 13:41.086
(applause)

13:41.086 --> 13:44.123
How many of you want
to see Bobo make eggs?

13:44.123 --> 13:45.591
Oh.

13:45.591 --> 13:46.592
Just kidding.

13:46.592 --> 13:47.626
Ouch.

13:47.626 --> 13:48.594
Well, all right.

13:48.594 --> 13:51.096
Apes before beauty.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.598
(chuckles)

13:53.899 --> 13:55.234
Frasier.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.235
Bobo.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.504
May the best chef win.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.239
FRASIER: Now, the first rule
of haute cuisine

14:00.239 --> 14:02.208
is to be sure you have
all your ingredients

14:02.208 --> 14:03.209
at hand, you see.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.477
We have eggs, milk, butter,

14:05.477 --> 14:09.315
spinach, and, of course,
our old friend, the shallot.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.583
(egg cracking)

14:12.852 --> 14:14.320
Why, look at that.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.322
He's not even
preheating the pan.

14:16.822 --> 14:17.656
The beast.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.959
Bobo's getting
an early lead.

14:19.959 --> 14:20.960
Yeah.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.461
It's very important

14:22.461 --> 14:24.730
to keep your eggs
light and fluffy.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.498
So, what you want to do

14:26.498 --> 14:31.003
is add a bit of milk
and a touch of flour.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.208
(Bebe yells)

14:36.208 --> 14:37.810
Stop that.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.211
(laughing)
Well, I...

14:39.211 --> 14:42.514
Oh, he's a pesky
little chef, isn't he?

14:42.514 --> 14:44.216
(Bebe laughing)

14:44.216 --> 14:47.086
Oh, you crazy chimp.

14:51.090 --> 14:54.193
Oh. Oh, my God.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.295
And this whole thing
was improvised.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.563
DAPHNE:
You're kidding.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.031
It's like you
and the chimp

14:59.031 --> 15:01.901
have been working
together for years.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.602
Boy, that's great stuff,
Frasier.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.471
You know, I can't
tell you how impressed

15:05.471 --> 15:06.472
the guys at McGinty's

15:06.472 --> 15:07.973
are that I have
such a famous son.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.241
What do
they say?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.010
Well, they don't say anything
to my face,

15:11.010 --> 15:12.011
but when I walk in,

15:12.011 --> 15:15.014
they kind of nudge
each other and whisper.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.882
Oh.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.284
(timer dings)

15:18.284 --> 15:19.551
That will be me
Shepherd's Pie.

15:19.551 --> 15:20.853
Shepherd's Pie?

15:22.288 --> 15:24.223
I must confess,
there's a part of me

15:24.223 --> 15:26.225
that wishes I could still do
the TV show.

15:26.725 --> 15:27.559
(doorbell rings)

15:27.559 --> 15:29.428
Well, there's a part
of me that wishes

15:29.428 --> 15:30.896
that monkey was
cooking dinner

15:30.896 --> 15:31.931
instead of you-know-who.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.934
But we put our dreams away.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
Oh, hi, Roz.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.237
Well, don't you
look nice.

15:38.237 --> 15:39.505
You're feeling better?
Yes, thank you.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.940
Uh, can we talk?

15:40.940 --> 15:41.941
Of course.
Come on in.

15:41.941 --> 15:42.942
What's the matter?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.443
Well, I talked
to my friends

15:44.443 --> 15:45.444
in business affairs

15:45.444 --> 15:47.446
and they say they're ready
to close our deals

15:47.446 --> 15:48.747
but Bebe's
holding it up.

15:48.747 --> 15:50.049
Of course, she's holding it up.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.417
She's trying to
make them sweat a bit.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.451
That's the
whole strategy

15:52.451 --> 15:54.486
behind this TV
show-- leverage.

15:54.486 --> 15:55.321
Yeah, well,

15:55.321 --> 15:57.189
um, I heard a rumor

15:57.189 --> 16:00.492
that A.M. Seattle isn't happy
with their regular hosts,

16:00.492 --> 16:01.794
and I think
she's angling

16:01.794 --> 16:03.062
for you
to take over.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.330
So where does
that leave me?

16:04.330 --> 16:07.199
Well, even if
that was Bebe's plan,

16:07.199 --> 16:09.568
I mean, you're forgetting
that it's still my career,

16:09.568 --> 16:10.569
and I'm calling the shots.

16:10.569 --> 16:13.072
There is no way I would continue
doing A.M. Seattle.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.040
You look like you're having
the time of your life.

16:15.040 --> 16:15.975
I'm playing
a character.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.443
There is a big difference

16:17.443 --> 16:20.446
between Dr. Frasier Crane,
psychiatrist and Frasier Crane

16:20.446 --> 16:22.848
the guy who starts
your morning right.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.084
I tell you what.

16:25.084 --> 16:26.919
I will speak to Bebe tomorrow
when we're in the chair.

16:27.453 --> 16:28.420
That's the industry term

16:28.420 --> 16:30.356
for when we're getting
our makeup put on.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.290
Thanks, Frasier.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.791
Yeah. Sure.

16:32.791 --> 16:35.294
God, this is so weird.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.796
Daphne usually has
such great taste.

16:37.796 --> 16:41.100
What is she thinking
with these glasses?

16:41.100 --> 16:42.301
Well, actually,
Roz, uh...

16:42.301 --> 16:43.802
I've got to go see

16:43.802 --> 16:45.371
what these
look like.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.672
Hi, Roz.
Hey, Martin.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.407
Hey.

16:48.407 --> 16:52.811
Somebody ought to tell Mr. Doyle
she's wearing a dude's glasses.

16:57.983 --> 17:01.820
Oh, Kiki,
you're a magician.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.622
Frasier, you're not
going to believe

17:04.123 --> 17:05.557
the wonderful news
I just got.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.358
They want us to stay on.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.160
What?
Yes.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.694
We had the
highest ratings

17:09.694 --> 17:10.628
the show's had
all year.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.498
I don't
believe this.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.766
Roz was right.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.768
You had no intention
of renegotiating

17:15.768 --> 17:16.667
my radio contract.

17:16.667 --> 17:20.105
I don't expect
gratitude, Frasier--

17:20.105 --> 17:22.107
just a little faith.

17:22.107 --> 17:25.109
I finished your KACL contract
this morning.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.078
You did?

17:26.078 --> 17:28.580
And I did quite
a good job, I might add.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.082
I'm sorry, Bebe.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.384
I owe you
an apology.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.653
Wow, this is wonderful.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.189
I got an extra
week's vacation,

17:37.189 --> 17:38.190
a very handsome raise.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.458
It's garbage
compared to

17:39.458 --> 17:41.226
what they'll give us
to stay on here.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.228
You'll get
an expense account,

17:43.228 --> 17:44.229
a wardrobe allowance,

17:44.229 --> 17:46.065
not to mention
a car and driver.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.399
No, no.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.901
Let's not forget
why I took this job.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.803
It was to raise
my profile

17:50.803 --> 17:52.704
to get a better deal
with the radio contract.

17:53.205 --> 17:56.575
We've done that, Bebe,
and I thank you.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.280
You're welcome, darling.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.582
And I respect
your choice.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.084
Thanks.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.085
Now, let's talk
about today's show.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.086
Right.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.587
We start with
the Friday Fiesta.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.923
Here are our costumes.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.225
Then we, uh, move on to

18:13.225 --> 18:15.727
the Girl Scout
cookie-selling champion.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.230
(crying):
Then we...

18:19.731 --> 18:21.600
Bebe, are you
all right?

18:22.468 --> 18:25.971
I've spent my life
in the wings.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.473
It was just nice

18:27.473 --> 18:30.742
having my moment
in the spotlight.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.010
The rush when

18:32.010 --> 18:35.314
that little red light
on the camera turns on.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.182
The strip
of masking tape

18:37.182 --> 18:38.684
on my dressing
room door

18:38.684 --> 18:40.185
with my name on it.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.687
The stage-door
Johnnies,

18:42.187 --> 18:44.189
or whatever
that strange man

18:44.189 --> 18:46.692
with the autograph
book calls himself.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.693
Admit it, darling,

18:47.693 --> 18:49.528
you want this
as much as I do.

18:49.528 --> 18:50.362
I saw it in your eyes

18:50.362 --> 18:51.797
during the pie
eating contest.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.733
Nobody loves
blueberries that much.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.735
It's the audience
you love.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.238
MAN: Are you ready for
Bebe and Frasier?

18:59.238 --> 19:01.540
(applause and cheers)

19:03.108 --> 19:04.943
Listen to them.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.446
They want you.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.882
They do want me,
don't they?

19:09.882 --> 19:11.884
Tell me to tear up
the contract, Frasier.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.752
Maybe it is time
for a change.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.654
Get away from him,
you she-thing!

19:15.654 --> 19:17.556
Niles.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.992
It's a good thing Dad
started choking on that peanut

19:19.992 --> 19:21.994
or I'd have never have
come back here for water.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.295
Stop this madness.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.030
He can't stop it.
No one can.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.064
Show business
is in his blood.

19:26.064 --> 19:27.399
No, psychiatry is.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.534
Frasier, you're a healer.

19:28.534 --> 19:29.234
Anyone can heal.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.802
You're better than that.

19:30.802 --> 19:32.171
You're an entertainer.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.038
Oh, God, Niles.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.040
She's right.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.775
I love the audience.

19:36.775 --> 19:37.876
I know
it's shallow,

19:37.876 --> 19:39.611
but it makes me
feel alive.

19:41.547 --> 19:42.948
Do you have
any idea

19:42.948 --> 19:44.917
how ridiculous you
look in this outfit?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.318
Frasier,

19:46.318 --> 19:49.188
I know I sometimes make light
of your radio show,

19:49.188 --> 19:52.191
but the truth is,
you provide help and hope

19:52.191 --> 19:54.693
and comfort to people
who need it.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.528
I have always envied you that.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.363
Don't listen
to that drivel!

20:00.866 --> 20:03.869
He's right, Bebe.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.370
I'm a psychiatrist.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.772
I can't do
this show anymore.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.174
I'm sorry.

20:09.174 --> 20:10.442
Then quit.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.277
Who needs you?

20:12.277 --> 20:14.780
I'll find some other
stuffed shirt

20:14.780 --> 20:17.783
who's happy to ride
my coattails to fame.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.184
Niles, you're a doctor.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.519
Niles, don't look into her eyes!

20:29.027 --> 20:29.995
Well, that's it.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.434
The dream is over.

20:37.202 --> 20:39.004
30 seconds.

20:39.004 --> 20:42.908
But I'm still a professional.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.943
There's an audience out there

20:44.943 --> 20:48.914
waiting for two people
to ride in on a donkey.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.850
I don't know about you...

20:53.852 --> 20:57.889
...but I'm not going
to let them down.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.363
It's your last show.

21:04.863 --> 21:05.764
Get out there.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.634
Thanks, brother,

21:08.634 --> 21:11.136
for keeping me grounded.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.744
Vaya con dios.

21:18.744 --> 21:23.215
