Meet me at the Carlyle
tonight at 9:00.

00:11.133 --> 00:13.700
- You're gonna kiss him again.
I know you.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.267
- I'm so sorry
about last night.

00:15.267 --> 00:16.567
I just want you to know--

00:16.567 --> 00:19.533
- It was just a kiss, Liza.
Let it go.

00:19.533 --> 00:21.967
- Nobody at work knows this,
but I'm 40.

00:21.967 --> 00:25.400
- I'm gonna sign with Millennial
on one condition:

00:25.400 --> 00:28.867
I use you as a case study.

Yes.

By Wednesday, there won't be

or socially transmitted

01:26.267 --> 01:27.467
"The Deciding Decade."

- And we were saving
the best news for last.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.900
Ellen's producer said Ellen read

01:31.900 --> 01:33.867
the advanced copy and loved it.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.533
- Love her.
- Fantastic.

01:35.533 --> 01:37.200
- There's one little hitch.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.067
She really responded
to the chapter

01:39.067 --> 01:40.867
where your 40-year-old patient
pretends to be

01:40.867 --> 01:42.933
a 26-year-old assistant.

01:42.933 --> 01:44.300
So, she'll have you on the show

01:44.300 --> 01:46.600
if you bring that
patient with you.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.833
- And reveal her identity
on national television?

01:49.833 --> 01:51.967
- That's impossible--that would
be totally unethical.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.433
- Not if the patient agrees.

01:53.433 --> 01:56.200
- It would be
such incredible publicity.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.700
That--maybe I could
reach out and ask.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.300
- Why would the patient consent?

02:02.300 --> 02:05.067
I mean, wasn't
she promised anonymity?

02:05.067 --> 02:07.533
- Well, she's clearly
an opportunist.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.400
- More like a sociopath.
- Yeah.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.600
Shaving one or two years off
your age is one thing,

02:11.600 --> 02:12.867
but living a double life?

02:12.867 --> 02:15.133
That is a very
disturbed individual.

02:15.133 --> 02:17.200
- Well--[scoffs],
in the chapter, she said

02:17.200 --> 02:20.500
that she applied for a lot of
jobs as a 40-year-old,

02:20.500 --> 02:23.433
and got turned down every time,
so she had to find

02:23.433 --> 02:26.333
a way around this
institutionalized ageism.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.133
- I don't see ageism,
I see someone

02:28.133 --> 02:30.967
who stepped out of the industry
and paid the price.

02:30.967 --> 02:32.833
She probably wasn't hired
because she doesn't have

02:32.833 --> 02:34.267
the skills or talent.

02:34.267 --> 02:36.767
- Well, I can certainly
reach out to her.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.467
- I think it's risky.

the deal with Ellen,

02:43.900 --> 02:45.233

02:45.233 --> 02:47.233
- Oh, my God.
We can't chance that.

- We'll keep working
and get in touch soon.

Thank you, Charles.

I'm still here.

Where are we on

03:07.967 --> 03:10.133
The early buzz on GoodReads
has been great.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.467

devices in the conference room?

03:17.467 --> 03:19.400
- I always keep it face down,
except--

03:19.400 --> 03:21.733
- Face down or put away,
that's the policy.

how much that means to me.

how many you can fit
in your mouth at once?

05:25.167 --> 05:28.333
- No, it's, um--
it's this parenting thing.

05:28.333 --> 05:29.700
Children were given
one marshmallow

05:29.700 --> 05:32.067
and told that they could
eat it immediately,

05:32.067 --> 05:35.133
or they could wait 15 minutes,

05:35.133 --> 05:37.433
and get two marshmallows.
- What?

05:37.433 --> 05:39.400
Why would anybody
do that to a kid?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.400
I mean, it's--that's torture.
- I know.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.933
But anyway, they followed the
kids for like 20 years,

05:44.933 --> 05:46.700
and they found out that
the ones that could

05:46.700 --> 05:50.300
delay gratification had better
life outcomes.

in this scenario?

05:57.333 --> 05:59.467
Am I the marshmallow?

So you want to take it slow,

that was me.

- What?

08:26.233 --> 08:27.567

08:27.567 --> 08:29.200

that you were Thad.

we were playing.

That's the twin, right?

- No, that's not Houdini-ing.

Houdini-ing is when someone has
sex with you from behind,

and then the original person

waves to you from
the bedroom window.

You know everything. You do.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.400
You're like Sexipedia.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.800
- Is Kelsey all right?
- Oh, yeah, no. She'll be fine.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.300
And now that she has
Thad's laptop,

09:35.300 --> 09:36.933
she never has to see Chad again.

09:36.933 --> 09:38.467
- She has Thad's laptop?
- Oh, yeah, no.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.633
I'ma help her get into it.

09:39.633 --> 09:40.667
You know, it's the least
I can do

09:40.667 --> 09:42.067
since she's been twinned.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.133
- No, "Twinned" is two girls
and the same dildo.

09:44.133 --> 09:46.267
- What? Really? Twinned?

09:46.267 --> 09:48.567
[gasps] Oh, my God.
Why do I doubt?

09:48.567 --> 09:50.167
- [laughs]
- Why have we not done that?

09:50.167 --> 09:52.900
You know, I got to go to work.
I will see you kids later.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.733
- Mwah.

09:56.867 --> 09:58.100
- Did you hear that?

09:58.100 --> 09:59.733
It's only a matter of time
before Kelsey

09:59.733 --> 10:01.667
gets into that laptop
and finds out everything.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.967
- Wait, what are you gonna do?

10:02.967 --> 10:04.333
- I got to tell her.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.067
And it's better that
she hears it from me first.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.700
I'm just gonna do it--
I'm gonna go in there

10:07.700 --> 10:09.067
and rip off the Band-Aid.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.733
- "Ripping off the Band-Aid"
is when two guys--

10:10.733 --> 10:13.300
- I don't want to know.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.733
- Good luck.

10:15.733 --> 10:17.300
Ooh.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.300
[rock music]

10:20.300 --> 10:24.033
*

10:24.033 --> 10:25.633
[knocking on door]

10:25.633 --> 10:27.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.933
- Lauren told me about
the Chad situation.

10:30.933 --> 10:32.133
Are you okay?

10:32.133 --> 10:35.033
- The whole thing
is just so gross.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.767
I wonder if Thad knew.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.633
He couldn't have, right?
- Uh...

10:38.633 --> 10:40.867
- I mean, I always brown out
at weddings, but...

10:40.867 --> 10:43.000
- You mean drink too much,
right?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.533
- Yeah--wait,
what do you think I--

10:44.533 --> 10:46.233
- No, nothing. Just that.

10:46.233 --> 10:47.700
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

10:47.700 --> 10:49.300
- I'm trying to guess
this password.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.933
It gave me a hint:
"Kelsey's favorite snack."

10:51.933 --> 10:54.467
I tried banana chips,
chocolate covered almonds.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.767
And no luck.
I'm gonna just--

10:56.767 --> 10:58.567
I've got to hire a computer
expert or something.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.067
- Are you sure?

11:00.067 --> 11:03.067
I mean, there could be a lot of
iffy stuff on there.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.200
- This is all
I have left of him.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.867
For better or for worse,
it's all right here.

11:08.867 --> 11:11.567
- Hi, uh, there is
a potential investor

11:11.567 --> 11:13.167
stopping by the office
in about ten minutes.

11:13.167 --> 11:15.700
Could you two be prepared
to talk about Millennial?

11:15.700 --> 11:17.333
Something short, like a--

11:17.333 --> 11:18.567
an elevator pitch?

11:18.567 --> 11:20.067
- Yeah, sure.
- Absolutely, yeah.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.067
- It's important.

11:21.067 --> 11:24.533
Uh, but casual.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.433
But important.

11:26.433 --> 11:29.100
*

11:29.100 --> 11:30.433
- Liza!

11:30.433 --> 11:32.833
*

11:32.833 --> 11:34.500
We must really be on the ropes
if Charles is

11:34.500 --> 11:36.100
springing a visit
like this on us.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.933
Had I known, I would have worn
something less whimsical.

11:37.933 --> 11:40.433
- Okay, this is from the
"Forbes" billionaires list.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.933
Bryce Reiger, 26.

11:41.933 --> 11:45.067
Founded Tap That, a digital
wallet app in 2014.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.800
I'll make sure to download it
on your phone.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.200
- Hmm, looks like another
Silicon Valley whiz kid

11:49.200 --> 11:50.700
throwing his money around.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.867
While his friends buy islands,
he buys prestige

11:52.867 --> 11:54.967
by saving a century-old
publishing house.

11:54.967 --> 11:57.300
- Oh, look.
He owns an island too.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.633
- If old media is so dead,

11:58.633 --> 12:00.567
why is new media
always trying to buy us?

12:00.567 --> 12:01.567
- Oh, that must be him.

12:01.567 --> 12:02.500
- Where?

12:02.500 --> 12:05.633
Oh, my...

12:05.633 --> 12:07.833
- So, are the any new
"Crown of Kings" coming out?

12:07.833 --> 12:09.133
I love "Crown of Kings."

12:09.133 --> 12:10.800
Besides "Twilight,"
it's the top-selling

12:10.800 --> 12:12.600
four-installment book series
of all time,

12:12.600 --> 12:14.567
with 106 million units.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.433
Uh, 25.4 million for
"Rise of Kings,"

12:17.433 --> 12:19.633
28.1 for "Clash of Kings,"

12:19.633 --> 12:22.633
17.8 for "Ghosts of Kings"--
that was the worst one--

12:22.633 --> 12:25.867
and 34.7 million
for "King of Kings."

12:25.867 --> 12:28.333
- You certainly know
your "Crown of Kings."

12:28.333 --> 12:31.100
This is our head of marketing,
Diana Trout.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.433
- It's easy for me
to memorize stuff.

12:32.433 --> 12:33.933
I'm a little on the spectrum.

12:33.933 --> 12:37.733
That's why your perfume is so
offensive to me.

12:37.733 --> 12:41.533
Not offensive, just, uh,
pungent and repulsive.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.067
- I beg your pardon?

12:43.067 --> 12:44.267
- [sniffs]

12:44.267 --> 12:46.867
Definitely smelling secretion
of beaver anus.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.133
- What?
- Otherwise known as castoreum.

12:49.133 --> 12:51.667
It's a common ingredient
in many commercial perfumes.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.200
- This is Givenchy.
So--

12:54.200 --> 12:57.133
- Said the beaver to his anus.

12:57.133 --> 13:01.167
- Why don't we continue this
conversation at dinner?

13:01.167 --> 13:04.100
- I will go shower.

13:07.233 --> 13:09.567
- Since our imprint curates
exclusive content

13:09.567 --> 13:12.067
for millennial readers, we're
excited to launch

13:12.067 --> 13:13.333
our first title:

13:13.333 --> 13:14.700
"The Deciding Decade:

13:14.700 --> 13:16.200
Making Your Twenties Matter."

13:16.200 --> 13:18.300
- The eBook will hyperlink
to the author's

13:18.300 --> 13:21.067
genre-leading podcast
and all social platforms.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.900
And for print, we're using
biodegradable ink

13:23.900 --> 13:26.633
on 100% recycled,
fair-trade paper.

13:26.633 --> 13:28.200
- Yes. I like all that.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.900
Tap that.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.733
Uh, don't your people
use Tap That?

13:31.733 --> 13:34.267
- Of course we do.

13:34.267 --> 13:35.833
[dinging]

13:35.833 --> 13:38.067
- So you just gave her money?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.500
- I gave her recognition
and affirmation.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.367
And ten American dollars, yes.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.733
- I love your tattoo.

13:44.733 --> 13:45.733
- Oh, thank you.

13:45.733 --> 13:47.267
- Yeah, are those ants?

13:47.267 --> 13:48.833
- They are termites.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.733
- That's revolting.

13:50.733 --> 13:52.533
And so fascinating.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.200
- Termites are one of
the most adaptable

13:54.200 --> 13:55.567
species on the planet.

13:55.567 --> 13:56.600
They live in every climate,

13:56.600 --> 13:58.067
they've survived every epoch,

13:58.067 --> 13:59.600
and they produce
so much hydrogen that

13:59.600 --> 14:01.067
the Department of Energy
considers them

14:01.067 --> 14:03.333
a potential renewable
fuel source.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.833
They're miraculous.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.067
- They also eat feces,
but I'm sure you're aware.

14:07.067 --> 14:08.867
- I--I think I recognize
the artist.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.533
Is it Kori Hurami?

14:10.533 --> 14:11.800
- How did you know that?

14:11.800 --> 14:14.300
- I have a really close friend
who knows him.

14:14.300 --> 14:17.300
He and Kori shared a studio for
a while in Kanagawa.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.467
- You're friends with Josh
from Inkburg?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.067
- Josh is Liza's boyfriend.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.833
Ex-boyfriend.
Not to rub it in.

14:23.833 --> 14:27.700
- Well, uh, not so ex,
anymore, actually.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.067
- What?
- Uh, yeah.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.633
We're trying
to figure things out.

14:30.633 --> 14:32.067
- Josh's work is just stunning.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.400
I mean, it silences me
every time I see it.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.167
He's a real artist.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.567
- Yeah, he really is.

14:37.567 --> 14:40.567

14:42.900 --> 14:43.900
- Thank you.
- Good night.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.433
- Have a good night.

14:45.433 --> 14:49.100
- Have a good one.
- We'll be in touch.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.867
That went well,
thanks to our millennials.

14:51.867 --> 14:53.167
- Well, it was a group effort.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.100
[phones dinging]

14:58.767 --> 15:01.233
Oh, God, noses in their
phones already.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.333
- Good night.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.600
I'll see everyone
in the morning.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.767
- Night.
- Good night.

15:04.767 --> 15:07.067
- I'm going uptown too.

15:07.067 --> 15:09.467
- Taxi?

15:09.467 --> 15:11.633
- Are we about to go to
a billionaire's loft party?

15:11.633 --> 15:12.933
- Yes, please.

15:12.933 --> 15:14.267
I may even find a computer nerd

15:14.267 --> 15:16.067
to help me crack open
Thad's laptop.

15:16.067 --> 15:18.967
- You have the laptop with you?
- Yes.

15:22.367 --> 15:25.367

15:38.500 --> 15:40.300
[cheering]

15:40.300 --> 15:43.400
- Your place is incredible.
- What is that thing?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.267
- Ah, that is a thermodynamic
decelerator.

15:46.267 --> 15:48.067
Yeah, the software engineers
are using it

15:48.067 --> 15:50.100
to launch blocks of ice
into the pool to see

15:50.100 --> 15:51.833
how much ice it takes
to lower the temperature

15:51.833 --> 15:53.267
of the water one degree.

15:53.267 --> 15:54.367
- Okay. Why?

15:54.367 --> 15:55.433
- What else are
you gonna do with

15:55.433 --> 15:57.200
a thermodynamic decelerator?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.367
Right?

15:58.367 --> 15:59.400
Oh, please. Help yourself.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.867
- Oh, Tequila?

16:00.867 --> 16:02.433
- Condensed water.

16:02.433 --> 16:03.800
For maximum hydration.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.800
Your cells will thank you.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.833
Uh, is there anything else
I can get you?

16:07.833 --> 16:10.300
- Actually, um,
I was wondering

16:10.300 --> 16:13.400
if anyone here could help me get
into this old laptop?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.433
It's a friend's.
He forgot the password.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.600
- Yeah. No problem.
Uh, find Lin.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.500
- No problem.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.133
*

16:21.133 --> 16:23.067
- Oh, is that something
healthy too?

16:23.067 --> 16:24.800
- No, it's cocaine.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.633
For the models.

16:26.633 --> 16:27.900
Unless you want some.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.900
- No.
- No?

16:29.900 --> 16:32.067
- I just want to tell you both
how glad I am

16:32.067 --> 16:33.533
that you're part of Empirical.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.233
People can't always tell
when I'm glad,

16:35.233 --> 16:36.700
because I'm a little
on the spectrum,

16:36.700 --> 16:38.067
but I'm really glad.

16:38.067 --> 16:39.900
- We are really glad
too, Bryce.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.967
- Yeah, I was worried that
a publishing house,

16:41.967 --> 16:43.600
especially one as old
as Empirical,

16:43.600 --> 16:46.733
would be nothing but relics
like Charles and Diana,

16:46.733 --> 16:49.067
but you two get it--
you get that

16:49.067 --> 16:51.400
we are literally on the cusp
of being able

16:51.400 --> 16:53.400
to do this...

16:53.400 --> 16:55.067
with a book.

16:55.067 --> 16:56.067
And you've read it.

16:56.067 --> 16:57.633
- That's a book of photographs.

16:57.633 --> 17:00.300
- Bottom line:
if it wasn't for you two,

17:00.300 --> 17:03.100
and a need for some enormous
taxable losses,

17:03.100 --> 17:05.300
I wouldn't even bother
with Empirical.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.633
But with you?

17:06.633 --> 17:09.267
I sense a paradigm shift.

17:09.267 --> 17:11.633
Provided you're as committed
to the future as I am.

17:11.633 --> 17:13.300
- Ah--
- Are you?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.067
- Hell yes!
- Absolutely!

17:15.067 --> 17:16.666
- All right. Tap that.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.300
- Oh.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.133
[dinging]

17:19.133 --> 17:20.833
Ah, it was a big one!

17:20.833 --> 17:22.166
- Ah, Lin. There you are.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.867
We need your, uh,
code-cracking powers.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.166
This is Kelsey and Liza.
This is Lin.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.733
Excuse me for a moment.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.367
I'm sure Lin can get your laptop
open in a few minutes.

17:29.367 --> 17:31.767
- [scoffs] Minutes?
I'm insulted.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.967
Let me see it.
- Oh.

17:33.967 --> 17:38.567
* *

17:38.567 --> 17:41.367
What if he's got stuff about
other girls on there?

17:41.367 --> 17:43.300
Like, weird videos?

17:43.300 --> 17:46.133
- Kelsey, you don't have to open
it if you don't want to.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.833
- But there could be some really
sweet, meaningful stuff.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.533
- All done.
- Seriously?

17:50.533 --> 17:53.867
- I know, I was hoping for
more of a challenge too.

17:53.867 --> 17:56.100
- I'm really nervous.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.200
- I'm right here.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.267
Whatever we find out,
we find out together.

18:01.267 --> 18:03.300
- I'll give you some privacy.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.933
- Wait, Lin.
What was the password?

18:05.933 --> 18:07.367
- "Deez nuts."

18:07.367 --> 18:08.967
- "Deez nuts"?

18:08.967 --> 18:11.833
That's my favorite snack?
- Are they like Grape Nuts?

18:11.833 --> 18:12.833
- What are Grape Nuts?

18:12.833 --> 18:14.167
- He's saying his nuts

18:14.167 --> 18:15.700
are my favorite snack.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.967
- Meaning his balls.

18:16.967 --> 18:18.900
- Ew.
- [sighs]

18:18.900 --> 18:20.933
You know what?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.567
I'm done.

18:22.567 --> 18:25.900
Deez nuts are the last
secret of Thad's

18:25.900 --> 18:28.233
that I needed to know about.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.133
Hey, do me a favor.

18:32.133 --> 18:33.767
Launch this into
the pool for me.

18:33.767 --> 18:36.600
- Seriously? Excellent.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.433
[all cheering]

18:45.067 --> 18:48.133
Rest in peace, Thad.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.700
Let's get out of here.

18:50.700 --> 18:57.267

18:57.267 --> 19:00.100
I'm so glad that computer's
not haunting me anymore.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.400
- [chuckles]

19:01.400 --> 19:02.867
- It's like
I can finally breathe.

19:02.867 --> 19:05.067
- Ah, I know what you mean.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.833
I mean, um,
I'm so happy for you.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.967
- I am so happy for you!

19:09.967 --> 19:13.067
But why didn't you tell me
you and Josh were back together?

19:13.067 --> 19:17.233
- Honestly, it's not all
really resolved.

19:17.233 --> 19:19.067
- Well, he did mess up
not including you

19:19.067 --> 19:20.900
in that "T Magazine" thing.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.267
Did he apologize for that?

19:23.267 --> 19:24.600
- Yeah.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.167
- And he's ready to have
your relationship

19:26.167 --> 19:27.300
out in the open?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.967
- There is nothing
he would like more

19:28.967 --> 19:31.067
than an open,
honest relationship.

19:31.067 --> 19:33.700
But sometimes you can't be

19:33.700 --> 19:35.167
100% honest.

19:35.167 --> 19:37.533
- Is that like a herpes thing?

19:37.533 --> 19:40.267
- What?
No!

19:40.267 --> 19:42.933
- I know it seems impossible,

19:42.933 --> 19:45.633
but he could be gone
just like that.

19:45.633 --> 19:48.067
So if you love him,

19:48.067 --> 19:49.867
just be with him.

19:49.867 --> 19:53.067
[indie rock music]

19:58.200 --> 19:59.400
- Good morning, everyone.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.333
I have an announcement to make.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.767
I'm very happy to tell you that
I just received word

20:03.767 --> 20:07.533
that we have a new
minority partner.

20:07.533 --> 20:08.800
Bryce Reiger.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.367
[applause]

20:10.367 --> 20:13.267
And let's have a very special
round of applause

20:13.267 --> 20:15.367
for Kelsey and Liza.

20:15.367 --> 20:17.300
They really helped
seal the deal.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.433
[cheers and applause]

20:21.567 --> 20:23.500
[phone dinging]
