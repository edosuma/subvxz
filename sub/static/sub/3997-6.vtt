00:01.630 --> 00:03.048
Nick, where do you even
buy sheets like this?

00:03.049 --> 00:04.375
They're the thread count
of a paper towel.

00:04.376 --> 00:06.011
Okay, I don't
know what to do.

00:06.012 --> 00:06.819
I thought these
sheets were good.

00:06.820 --> 00:07.865
You said these
sheets were fine.

00:07.866 --> 00:08.867
WINSTON:
They're fine. Relax.

00:08.868 --> 00:10.799
He's freaking out.

00:10.800 --> 00:11.818
You know,
Amelia's coming in town...

00:11.820 --> 00:12.818
Which one of your depressing

00:12.820 --> 00:13.846
ex-girlfriends is Amelia?

00:14.547 --> 00:15.587
Freshman year.

couple days on work.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.556
This is my chance.

00:36.557 --> 00:37.567
I even got
a new shirt.

00:39.512 --> 00:41.577
That's a cool shirt;
I like that shirt.

00:41.578 --> 00:42.596
Yeah, look cool, man.

00:43.597 --> 00:45.499
You making fun of
my shirt, Schmidt?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.549
Oh, my God!

00:46.550 --> 00:48.549
Jess, please stop
working at the haunted house.

00:48.550 --> 00:49.590
JESS: It's just
through the weekend.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.596
You all get free tickets,
you know.

00:51.597 --> 00:52.503
Oh, no, I'm not going.

00:52.504 --> 00:53.525
I don't do haunted houses.

00:53.526 --> 00:55.500
- What? You scared?
- Uh, well,

00:55.503 --> 00:57.511
Little kids are scared.
I just don't like it.

00:57.512 --> 00:58.562
I got it. You look like
a zombie Woody Allen.

00:58.563 --> 01:00.566
- NICK: Yeah.
- (Imitating Woody Allen): These brains are terrible.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.528
And such-such small portions.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.510
(Imitating Woody Allen):
On Christmas, I like to eat

01:04.510 --> 01:05.531
Chinese people's brains.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.504
They're the only ones
that are open.

01:07.505 --> 01:11.503
(Imitating Woody Allen):
Zombie Cristina Barcelona.

01:11.504 --> 01:12.533
Yeah, I have nothing
to add to this.

01:12.534 --> 01:14.553
I'm gonna be home
late tonight, you guys.

01:14.554 --> 01:16.592
Uh, so don't wait up, 'cause
I'm going over to Sam's house

01:16.593 --> 01:18.520
to mix his batter.

01:18.521 --> 01:19.549
Oh, yeah.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.511
Not in that costume.

01:21.512 --> 01:23.504
NICK: I don't know.
Costume kind of works for me.

01:23.505 --> 01:25.553
Kind of a sexy,
undead driver's ed teacher.

01:25.554 --> 01:26.590
It's my sweet spot.

01:26.591 --> 01:28.519
Sam doesn't care
what I look like.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.565
'Cause I'm not his girlfriend.

01:29.566 --> 01:31.519
And I'm gonna
kick him to the curb

01:31.520 --> 01:33.533
once I've used his body
like a moisturizer sample.

01:33.534 --> 01:34.591
Hey-yo!

01:34.592 --> 01:36.550
(Imitating Woody Allen):
I couldn't afford my therapist,

01:36.551 --> 01:38.499
so I ate his brains.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.503
Marx brothers.

01:40.504 --> 01:41.553
Hear, hear.

01:41.554 --> 01:42.596

01:53.508 --> 01:54.537
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:54.538 --> 01:56.504
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:56.507 --> 01:58.566
Oh, oh.

Oh.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.511
(Laughs)

02:01.512 --> 02:03.507
Um, here's your wallet.

02:03.508 --> 02:04.549
Oh, thank you.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.527
You must have dropped it
on our most recent trip

02:06.528 --> 02:07.569
to No Pants City.

02:07.570 --> 02:08.577
(Laughs)
Just so you know,

02:08.578 --> 02:09.577
I didn't look in it.

02:09.578 --> 02:10.577
'Cause I don't care

02:10.578 --> 02:11.588
and I respect your privacy.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.566
Then how'd you
know it was

02:13.567 --> 02:15.529
- my wallet?
- Well played, Sam Sweeny--

02:15.530 --> 02:16.594
Born in Boston, six-four.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.552
I didn't know
you worked in the E.R.

02:18.553 --> 02:19.569
Until I got here, though.

02:19.570 --> 02:20.596
Yeah, pediatrics.

02:20.597 --> 02:22.587
You're a doctor for children.

02:22.588 --> 02:24.545
It's, you know,
mostly paperwork.

02:24.546 --> 02:26.517
That why you have
so many cute cards on the wall?

02:26.518 --> 02:28.528
"Dear Dr. Sam..."

02:28.529 --> 02:29.592
They call you Dr. Sam?

02:29.593 --> 02:31.532
"Thank you
for making me better.

02:31.533 --> 02:34.541
I love you,
and so does my bunny."

02:34.542 --> 02:35.573
Nice kid, but she
can't draw for crap.

02:35.574 --> 02:37.531
I mean, she just
traced Bugs Bunny.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.506
I didn't know you were a,
like, caring person.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.588
Same guy.
Same guy.

02:40.589 --> 02:42.545
I'm the same guy
that did you

02:42.546 --> 02:43.592
in that falafel
restaurant, you remember?

02:43.593 --> 02:45.550
- And a dirty one, at that.
- Mm-hmm.

02:45.553 --> 02:47.571
- Please don't do this.
- Dr. Sam.

02:47.572 --> 02:49.567
Don't start thinking
I'm some amazing guy.

02:49.568 --> 02:53.499
This is why I don't
tell girls what I do.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.581
This doesn't change the way
I feel about you.

02:54.582 --> 02:56.554
I feel nothing.
This is purely physical.

02:56.555 --> 02:57.582
Dr. Sam!

02:57.583 --> 02:59.591
Oh, Ben!
What's up?

02:59.592 --> 03:00.562
Fish tails?

03:02.508 --> 03:03.587
I, uh...

03:03.588 --> 03:06.507
How could I say no, buddy?

03:06.508 --> 03:08.574
(Goofy voice):
Fish tail! Fish tail!

03:08.575 --> 03:10.528
Up top!

03:10.529 --> 03:11.528
(Laughs)

03:11.529 --> 03:12.596
This makes me feel nothing.

03:12.597 --> 03:14.587
I feel nothing.

03:14.588 --> 03:16.592
SCHMIDT:
I haven't worn these in years.

03:16.593 --> 03:17.503
Here you go.

03:17.504 --> 03:18.503
Wow, Schmidt.

03:18.504 --> 03:19.577
You've got so many boots.

03:19.578 --> 03:21.523
You know who doesn't
have a lot of boots?

03:21.524 --> 03:23.500
Guys who aren't getting
laid on the reg.

03:23.501 --> 03:25.504
- Ooh, trust me, I know. Shelby and I agreed
- Mm-hmm.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.502
That we're gonna dress sexy
this Halloween, so...

03:27.503 --> 03:29.554
hopefully that'll make us want
to have sex with each other.

03:29.555 --> 03:32.295
You know, at night,
I can actually feel gusts

03:32.296 --> 03:34.516
of frigid air coming
from beneath your door.

03:34.517 --> 03:35.586
I get it, Schmidt.
We're in a rut.

03:35.587 --> 03:37.548
Without sex, she's not
your girlfriend, okay?

03:37.549 --> 03:39.536
She's a friend that
you buy meals for.

03:39.537 --> 03:40.586
Winston, I get it, man.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.596
You're... you're
scared to end it.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.545
You're just
like Cece.

03:43.546 --> 03:45.525
Cece's scared to
end it with Robby,

03:45.526 --> 03:47.549
because clearly she's
still nuts about me.

03:47.550 --> 03:49.596
Robby's nice.
Good guy, man.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.549
He always has gum.

03:50.550 --> 03:52.510
"Oh, Robby-- he's
such a nice guy."

03:52.511 --> 03:53.571
I'll show you
nice guy. Boom.

03:53.572 --> 03:55.499
Punch him
in his face.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.540
Yeah, put you in a
guillotine choke hold.

03:56.541 --> 03:58.090
And then Robby's
like, "Oh, my God!"

03:58.091 --> 04:00.086
"I can't believe this.
Young Abraham Lincoln

04:00.087 --> 04:02.077
is choking me out
in his guillotine."

04:02.078 --> 04:04.075
You're going as young
Abe Lincoln for Halloween?

04:04.076 --> 04:06.091
Statistically speaking,
every American

04:06.092 --> 04:09.007
thinks about Abraham Lincoln
at least once a day.

04:09.008 --> 04:10.073
And Cece's
American, so...

04:10.074 --> 04:11.612
Thank you for
that information, Schmidt.

04:11.663 --> 04:12.661
Yeah.

04:12.662 --> 04:13.721
What's up, Robby?

04:13.722 --> 04:15.737
What's up, Robby,
you stupid idiot?

04:15.738 --> 04:17.711
You had an alter
ego, remember?

04:17.712 --> 04:18.745
Yeah.

04:18.745 --> 04:20.690
The guy who'd
been in a coma

04:20.692 --> 04:22.737
who woke up thinking
he had invented pie.

04:22.738 --> 04:25.699
Oh, I got a great new idea
for a dessert!

04:25.700 --> 04:27.661
Wait a second,
what year is it?

04:27.662 --> 04:29.741
(Laughs)

04:29.742 --> 04:31.711
That's awesome
you liked that.

04:31.712 --> 04:32.746
No, I'm really glad you're here.

04:32.747 --> 04:34.737
Welcome to Los Angeles.

04:34.738 --> 04:36.699
L.A., as the locals call it.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.696
This is the city
where many scenes

04:38.697 --> 04:40.724
from the film Beverly
Hills Chihuahua were shot.

04:40.725 --> 04:42.658
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- Mm-hmm.

04:42.659 --> 04:43.662
I made you up a couch.

04:43.663 --> 04:45.667
- Wow.
- The double eye patch.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.654
- You trying to impress me?
- Yes!

04:47.657 --> 04:48.703
Absolutely!

04:49.704 --> 04:50.983
You kidding?

05:02.721 --> 05:03.742
- CECE: A doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

05:03.745 --> 05:05.728
I had him pegged for

05:05.729 --> 05:08.724
a part-time tennis pro or
an unemployed handsome guy.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.653
He cares about people for
a living; it's so much hotter.

05:11.654 --> 05:12.742
You're starting
to like him now.

05:12.743 --> 05:14.728
No, no, no,
we're just coworkers.

05:14.729 --> 05:16.670
On the night shift.

05:16.671 --> 05:17.686
These fit great, Jess.

05:17.687 --> 05:18.738
Really, thank you so much.

05:18.739 --> 05:21.711
It's like a childhood dream
come true for me.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.691
To be a Ninja Turtle.

05:23.692 --> 05:25.669
And to have a beautiful
girlfriend, of course.

05:25.670 --> 05:26.669
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

05:26.670 --> 05:27.721
What am I looking at here?

05:27.722 --> 05:29.661
Robby, man to man,

05:29.662 --> 05:30.731
you didn't want
to wear something,

05:30.732 --> 05:32.692
I don't know,
a little more form flattering?

05:32.693 --> 05:34.716
Maybe like a pile of towels,
the number eight?

05:34.717 --> 05:36.683
- Schmidt.
- I know. But how could I not

05:36.684 --> 05:37.721
knock down
such low-hanging fruit?

05:37.722 --> 05:39.682
Speaking of low-hanging fruit,

05:39.683 --> 05:40.727
Jess, you didn't
want to let out

05:40.728 --> 05:41.717
- the pants a little bit?
- No.

05:41.718 --> 05:42.729
- Not even a touch?
- No.

05:42.732 --> 05:44.657
You want to look
at your work?

05:44.658 --> 05:45.657
Looks great.

05:45.658 --> 05:46.719
Not to an eight-year-old child.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.733
Who's just staring
right down the barrel.

05:47.734 --> 05:48.742
- Enough.
- Are you guys coming to

05:48.743 --> 05:50.683
the Halloween
festivities tomorrow?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.692
- Actually, we're...
- I think you should come.

05:52.693 --> 05:53.690
It's for charity.

05:53.691 --> 05:54.708
You like charity, Robby, right?

05:54.709 --> 05:56.703
Yeah, sure.
Like Cece dating you.

05:56.704 --> 05:57.737
(Laughs)

05:57.738 --> 05:59.721
Awesome. Um...

06:00.708 --> 06:02.704
- Why not?
- No. I mean,

06:02.707 --> 06:04.712
- We have that thing...
- Don't worry about my friends.

06:04.713 --> 06:06.690
I would love
to hang out with your friends.

06:06.691 --> 06:08.686
I think we should do it, because
I want to wear this costume out.

06:08.687 --> 06:10.662
You know what I mean?
So I say yes.

06:10.663 --> 06:12.662
Just, uh, keep the pumpkins
away from me, okay?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.720
I kind of cut myself
last Halloween.

06:14.721 --> 06:16.703
I mean, not on a knife.

06:16.704 --> 06:20.703
I-I, you know,
I cut myself on the pumpkin.

06:20.704 --> 06:22.683
You should've
made a move in college.

06:22.684 --> 06:24.724
No, I didn't have
moves, Amelia.

06:24.725 --> 06:26.708
- (Laughs)
- My moves were

06:26.711 --> 06:29.674
Singing to you and trying
to give you back rubs and...

06:29.675 --> 06:32.682
I do remember you picking a lot
of eyelashes off my cheeks.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.673
Didn't you think it
was weird that I kept

06:34.674 --> 06:36.746
showing up at your door, telling
you I had a family tragedy?

06:36.747 --> 06:39.653
How many grandparents
did you think I had?

06:39.654 --> 06:40.687
(Both laugh)

06:40.688 --> 06:42.707
I had a bad bag
of moves, lady.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.721
Well, they're not
bad any more, Nick Miller.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.707
(Groans)

06:54.708 --> 06:56.707
Ah, that's great.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.666
(Groans)

06:58.667 --> 07:00.657
(Both laugh)

07:00.658 --> 07:02.666
That is for real.

07:02.667 --> 07:03.721
There's more
where that came from.

07:03.722 --> 07:05.667
- (Both laugh)
- Uh-oh.

07:12.717 --> 07:14.666
(Groans):
Oh, that's good stuff.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.688
That is good.

07:18.712 --> 07:19.711
(Sighs)

07:19.712 --> 07:20.736
(Whispering):
Hey.

07:20.737 --> 07:22.653
(Whispering): Sam's in there.
- Yeah, Amelia's in there.

07:22.654 --> 07:23.725
- High five for sluts.
- Yeah!

07:23.728 --> 07:25.692
- (Chuckles)
- Hey.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.670
I think I might
like Sam.

07:27.671 --> 07:29.681
Jess, I thought the whole thing
was how you didn't like him.

07:29.682 --> 07:30.717
I know, but then...

07:30.718 --> 07:31.720
(Groans)

07:31.721 --> 07:33.703
Hey.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.661
Hi. You must be
Amelia. I'm Jess.

07:35.662 --> 07:36.690
Nice to meet you.

07:36.691 --> 07:37.723
Nice to meet you.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.746
Nick's told me
a lot about you.

07:38.747 --> 07:39.746
Yes, I did.

07:39.747 --> 07:41.661
Yeah, it finally happened.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.708
It's crazy--
Nick and Amelia.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.712
- Together.
- Together, yeah.

07:44.713 --> 07:45.725
- Together, yeah.
- Together.

07:46.476 --> 07:47.475
Really? Right now?

07:47.476 --> 07:49.445
Okay.

07:49.446 --> 07:51.461
(Giggles)

07:51.462 --> 07:53.482
Yeah, good.

07:53.483 --> 07:55.462
Okay.

07:55.712 --> 07:57.695
All right, call
me tonight?

07:57.696 --> 07:58.706
Actually, tonight's
the last night

07:58.707 --> 07:59.706
of this haunted house thing.

07:59.707 --> 08:00.742
Here's a crazy idea.

08:00.743 --> 08:02.657
What if you came?

08:02.658 --> 08:03.715
Well, I don't really do,

08:03.716 --> 08:05.686
uh, the, you know,
sort of costume thing.

08:05.687 --> 08:06.698
I'm gonna be dressed up.

08:06.699 --> 08:07.712
I think you should
dress up, too.

08:07.713 --> 08:09.699
'Cause it'd be cool.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.745
For me.

08:11.746 --> 08:14.733
Okay. I'll try to
make it, darling.

08:17.658 --> 08:18.707
(Laughs)

08:18.708 --> 08:21.688
(Laughs)

08:24.658 --> 08:25.700
Well, I wish I hadn't
have seen that.

08:25.701 --> 08:27.724
You wish you hadn't seen that?

08:27.725 --> 08:30.700
- I wish I hadn't seen...
- Fair point.

08:30.701 --> 08:31.708
What if tonight's a test?

08:31.709 --> 08:33.736
If he shows up
wearing a costume,

08:33.738 --> 08:35.657
he likes me.

08:35.658 --> 08:36.712
- Sound logic.
- I know.

08:36.715 --> 08:39.649
Jess, I-I...
Jess, I was kidding.

08:39.650 --> 08:40.655
How do the boots
feel, man?

08:40.657 --> 08:41.719
Feel fantastic, man.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.731
Well, there's more
where that came from.

08:42.732 --> 08:43.738
Got a lot of boots.

08:43.739 --> 08:45.695
Whoo, looky here!

08:45.696 --> 08:46.723
One of my brothers in blue.

08:46.724 --> 08:48.686
That gun looks real.
Let me see that for a second.

08:48.687 --> 08:49.740
LAPD! Stand down!
Stand down!

08:49.741 --> 08:51.692
I'm standing, I'm standing!
Look at that!

08:51.693 --> 08:53.699
(Gasping)

08:53.700 --> 08:54.746
Butch it up,
Axel Foley.

08:54.747 --> 08:58.670
Shelby's coming.

08:58.671 --> 08:59.696
Yeah.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.649
(Chuckles)

09:03.650 --> 09:04.674
Hey.

09:04.675 --> 09:06.670
Hey. What, uh...

09:06.671 --> 09:07.717
What-what are you?

09:07.718 --> 09:11.675
I'm reigning
cats and dogs!

09:12.700 --> 09:13.741
Get it?

09:13.742 --> 09:15.716
Reigning...

09:15.717 --> 09:18.670
cats and dogs.

09:18.671 --> 09:20.732
Those stuffed animals
are gonna look good

09:20.733 --> 09:23.742
on the floor of my bedroom.

09:25.650 --> 09:26.661
Oh!

09:26.662 --> 09:27.715
What are you doing?!

09:27.716 --> 09:28.729
No, it's cool, it's cool.

09:28.730 --> 09:29.729
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Schmidt.

09:29.730 --> 09:30.727
Hey, Robby.

09:30.728 --> 09:31.729
Hey, look, I get it.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.653
Guy who shot John Lennon

09:33.654 --> 09:34.696
- dressed as a Ninja Turtle.
- No.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.678
Cece, you're an angel,
as always.

09:36.679 --> 09:38.695
Get off my horse,
Schmidt.

09:38.696 --> 09:40.673
Hey, Lincoln, right?
That's awes...

09:40.674 --> 09:41.700
You know, I was just thinking
about Lincoln today.

09:41.701 --> 09:43.666
Yeah, Robby, we all were.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.698
This is kind of funny.

09:44.699 --> 09:45.731
The two of you together
on that horse,

09:45.732 --> 09:46.738
you kind of look like
a bride and a groom.

09:46.739 --> 09:48.711
I will throw you

09:48.712 --> 09:51.737
off of this horse with
my bare hands. I will.

09:51.738 --> 09:53.745
I'm gonna tell him
how I feel tonight.

09:53.746 --> 09:55.692
- You are?
- Think so.

09:55.693 --> 09:56.692
AMELIA:
Boo!

09:56.693 --> 09:58.657
(Laughs)

09:58.658 --> 09:59.702
What'd you carve here?

09:59.703 --> 10:01.675
Oh, it's a secret.
I'm not done yet.

10:01.676 --> 10:03.675
(Both laugh)

10:05.675 --> 10:06.702
What's wrong with me?

10:06.703 --> 10:08.692
I wanted this for
so long with her,

10:08.693 --> 10:10.666
and now...
it's just too much.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.671
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

10:12.672 --> 10:14.671
You want to know why I
don't like haunted houses?

10:14.672 --> 10:16.700
- Why?
- Because they're just like relationships.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.732
You walk in
all confident,

10:18.733 --> 10:21.687
and then once you get in,
it's not what you thought

10:21.688 --> 10:23.682
it was gonna be,
and it's scary.

10:23.683 --> 10:24.729
Nice, you've liked her
for a long time.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.711
Go in the "haunted house."

10:26.712 --> 10:28.675
I'm gonna go
in the "haunted house."

10:28.676 --> 10:30.695
Ta-da! That's me,

10:30.696 --> 10:32.666
that's you, and
that's our dog.

10:32.667 --> 10:33.682
(Both laugh)

10:33.683 --> 10:35.703
I look so scared.

10:35.704 --> 10:36.729
Bride and groom?

10:36.730 --> 10:38.682
No!

10:38.683 --> 10:39.746
No, I'm here with
the Ninja Turtle!

10:39.747 --> 10:41.692
Bride and Ninja Turtle.

10:42.692 --> 10:43.702
I don't get it.

10:43.703 --> 10:44.742
I don't get
it, either.

10:44.743 --> 10:46.703
Like she lost a
bet or something.

10:46.704 --> 10:47.712
What is wrong with you?

10:47.713 --> 10:48.724
Seriously!

10:48.725 --> 10:49.725
It's okay, Cece.

10:49.726 --> 10:51.699
No, it's not okay!

10:51.700 --> 10:54.687
You need to go home
and change, Schmidt.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.699
I know you have more
costumes in your closet.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.695
Those costumes are for Purim.
Purim's in March.

11:00.696 --> 11:02.446
I don't care!
You're doing this intentionally

11:02.447 --> 11:03.674
just to mess with me!

11:03.675 --> 11:04.681
All right, calm down.

11:04.682 --> 11:05.727
Everybody just...
just calm down.

11:05.728 --> 11:07.688
All right, Schmidt?
Let's take a walk.

11:07.689 --> 11:09.678
Let's take a walk.

11:09.679 --> 11:11.691
Look, let's just cut
the crap, okay?

11:11.692 --> 11:13.695
I know you think I'm dumb,

11:13.696 --> 11:16.732
and you can hit on Cece
and make fun of me all day long,

11:16.733 --> 11:20.674
but I'm not going
anywhere, all right?

11:20.675 --> 11:21.708
You're a big guy,
you know that?

11:21.709 --> 11:23.682
Yeah.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.667
Luckily, I've got
a stone forehead.

11:25.668 --> 11:26.695
What?

11:26.696 --> 11:28.674
I'm sorry.

11:28.675 --> 11:29.712
- No, it's cool, man.
- You just tried to head-butt me.

11:29.713 --> 11:30.738
- I had to stop you.
- No, yeah, yeah.

11:30.741 --> 11:32.738
- I got you. I got you.
- All right.

11:32.741 --> 11:34.738
- Damn it!
- Schmidt, you did it again.

11:34.739 --> 11:36.681
How do you see that
coming every time?

11:36.682 --> 11:37.721
You wind up. You make,
like, a little wind-up thing.

11:37.722 --> 11:39.683
- I just...
- Hit me right in the forehead.

11:39.684 --> 11:40.727
Yeah, well, you tried to
head-butt me with your forehead.

11:40.728 --> 11:42.650
Yeah, I know I was
trying to head-butt you.

11:42.651 --> 11:43.687
Okay, listen.

11:43.688 --> 11:45.703
I think there's
two options here.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.661
We can either go the way
that things have been going

11:48.662 --> 11:50.666
and we're going to have
a big problem,

11:50.667 --> 11:54.687
or we can just knock this off
and let's be friends, okay?

11:54.688 --> 11:55.725
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. I'm sorry, too.

11:55.728 --> 11:57.654
- I'm sorry, too.
- My bad.

11:57.657 --> 11:58.712
- No, truce.
- All right, truce.

12:00.650 --> 12:01.708
Will you stop trying
to head-butt me, man?

12:01.709 --> 12:03.682
I just...

12:03.683 --> 12:04.692
Look at this guy.

12:04.693 --> 12:05.742
- Looking great.
- Oh, my God.

12:05.745 --> 12:07.721
- What?
- He came.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.653
He's not wearing
a costume.

12:11.654 --> 12:12.700
Yeah, but he came, so...

12:12.701 --> 12:14.692
- SAM: Hey.
- Hey.

12:14.695 --> 12:16.717
Oh, I got to sneeze.

12:21.692 --> 12:22.738
I'm a clown for you.

12:22.739 --> 12:24.745
Just don't ask me
to wear this in bed.

12:24.746 --> 12:26.725
(Chuckling):
Okay.

12:30.692 --> 12:32.692
(Jess giggling)

12:33.975 --> 12:35.923
I think, when he
comes here tonight,

12:35.924 --> 12:37.906
I'm just going to be like,
"Sam, crazy idea--

12:37.907 --> 12:39.877
why don't we take this
to another level?"

12:39.978 --> 12:41.967
And pretend like I'm just
thinking of it, but I'm not...

12:41.968 --> 12:43.945
(Screaming)

12:43.946 --> 12:45.975
(Growling)

12:47.462 --> 12:49.445
(Coughing)

12:49.446 --> 12:51.442
- Can you hand me my coffee?
- Yeah.

12:51.445 --> 12:53.457
Zombie, just tell
him the truth.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.415
Mummy's right.
Take the big swing.

12:55.416 --> 12:56.462
It's okay to be vulnerable.

12:56.463 --> 12:58.433
(Sighs)
You guys are right.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.483
Life as a doctor.

13:01.484 --> 13:03.420
Your phone must just be

13:03.421 --> 13:05.420
blowing up with
life-saving texts, huh?

13:05.421 --> 13:08.428
"Don't die on me, Danny Boy!
Use the paddles!"

13:08.429 --> 13:09.438
No, it's a girl.

13:11.404 --> 13:12.444
Oh, I thought Jess was working.

13:12.445 --> 13:14.412
It's another girl.
Just a weekend thing.

13:14.413 --> 13:16.457
Does Jess know
you're texting other girls?

13:16.458 --> 13:18.492
Yeah. We're, like,
totally honest with each other.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.424
You know?
I mean, she wants

13:20.425 --> 13:21.436
a relationship less than I do.

13:21.437 --> 13:22.450
It's actually awesome.

13:22.451 --> 13:24.424
(Chuckling):
Right.

13:24.425 --> 13:26.478
And you're coming over
tonight, hmm?

13:26.479 --> 13:29.441
And she's going to talk to you.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.442
Ooh.

13:32.483 --> 13:34.437
NICK:
All right, man.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.462
You've got to be kidding me.

13:38.450 --> 13:39.462
Just do it, Nick.

13:40.463 --> 13:41.420
Don't be scared, Nick.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.424
You're a grown man.
This is a haunted house.

13:44.425 --> 13:45.416
Game time.

13:45.417 --> 13:48.458
I have no idea how they
deep-fry a turkey dinner,

13:48.459 --> 13:51.416
but I am so glad they do
because I love it.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.467
Do you love your legs? Because,
I'll tell you, diabetes doesn't.

13:53.468 --> 13:55.442
- Where have you been?
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

13:55.445 --> 13:57.445
I totally
lost track of time.

13:57.446 --> 13:59.429
We decided that we're
going to hang out more.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.437
All of us are going
to hang out more.

14:01.438 --> 14:02.492
You know, 'cause I
remember you saying

14:02.493 --> 14:04.492
- that missed hanging out with Schmidt, so...
- Oh, Robby.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.492
- You said that?
- Yeah, I... yeah, I... I said it, but...

14:07.493 --> 14:09.448
No, because I want
to hang out with you, too.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.475
With Robby there?

14:10.476 --> 14:13.403
Yeah, with Robby there.

14:13.404 --> 14:14.462
- Good.
- Good.

14:14.465 --> 14:16.454
- Oh, yeah, good, good.
- Good.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.975
Lincoln, bringing the
nation back together again.

14:21.917 --> 14:22.991
NICK:
Jess!

14:22.992 --> 14:24.920
Jess, where are you?

14:24.921 --> 14:26.912
DISTORTED MALE VOICE:
Watch your step!

14:26.913 --> 14:28.912
- (Evil laughter)
- It's just a recording.

14:28.913 --> 14:29.950
Good, good. Fun.

14:29.951 --> 14:31.949
(Hysterical laughter)

14:31.950 --> 14:34.916
Okay. It's not a race.
It's not a...

14:34.917 --> 14:36.920
(Eerie giggling)

14:36.921 --> 14:37.924
(Yells)

14:37.925 --> 14:39.950
(High-pitched screaming)

14:44.908 --> 14:46.917
(Giggling)

14:51.429 --> 14:53.424
Welcome to the morgue,

14:53.425 --> 14:54.438
Officer and...

14:56.404 --> 14:58.416
Sorry. I have no idea what...

14:58.417 --> 14:59.458
that whole thing... I don't...

14:59.459 --> 15:02.416
I'm reigning cats and dogs.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.417
- What?
- "Reigning" like a queen,

15:04.420 --> 15:06.474
But... but "raining"
like the weather.

15:06.475 --> 15:07.491
No.

15:07.492 --> 15:09.428
"It's raining
cats and dogs!"

15:09.429 --> 15:11.462
- Right.
- It's a joke.

15:11.465 --> 15:13.475
- Not really.
- What?

15:13.478 --> 15:16.424
Hmm? No, I'm saying, like, it's
not really... not really funny.

15:16.425 --> 15:18.450
- It's hilarious.
- I thought you were going to dress sexy.

15:18.453 --> 15:20.487
A sense of humor is sexy.

15:20.488 --> 15:22.408
I don't want to date the
queen of Cats and Dogs.

15:22.409 --> 15:24.433
- Reigning cats and dogs.
- Makes no sense.

15:24.434 --> 15:26.427
I don't see the queen of
England running around

15:26.428 --> 15:27.492
- with a cape and British people stapled to it.
- What?

15:27.493 --> 15:29.475
When is the last time
you heard somebody say,

15:29.476 --> 15:31.411
"Man, you know what's sexy?

15:31.412 --> 15:33.411
A woman with stuffed
animals taped to her back."

15:33.412 --> 15:35.424
Look how good I look!
Look how stylish I look.

15:35.425 --> 15:38.411
That's not sexy. I feel like
I'm getting a speeding ticket.

15:38.412 --> 15:40.410
Ooh! Shelby, you made me so mad,
my mustache is coming off!

15:40.411 --> 15:42.496
Why do you have a mustache
glued on top of your mustache.

15:44.404 --> 15:45.492
Why aren't we having sex?

15:45.493 --> 15:48.441
(Ghoulish moaning)

15:48.442 --> 15:50.438
- Shut up, bitch.
- Sorry.

15:51.458 --> 15:54.399
Shelby, this is not working.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.399
It's just not.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.438
I know.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.411
Oh, I get it.

16:01.412 --> 16:03.403
Reigning cats and dogs.

16:03.404 --> 16:05.438
It's funny. It is.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.404
(Whispering):
Jess.

16:13.404 --> 16:15.495
Jessica Day, where are you?

16:15.496 --> 16:17.437
(Shrieking)

16:17.438 --> 16:18.491
(Grunting)

16:18.492 --> 16:20.458
No, no!

16:24.421 --> 16:26.411
(Chuckling)

16:26.412 --> 16:28.495
Very effective.
Very scary.

16:28.496 --> 16:30.402
EERIE FEMALE VOICE:
Come in! Come in!

16:30.403 --> 16:31.450
This is fun.
This is entertaining.

16:31.451 --> 16:33.446
(Screaming)

16:35.404 --> 16:37.449
Oh, no! Jess!

16:37.450 --> 16:39.411
No! No!

16:39.412 --> 16:40.475
- Jess! No!
- No, I'm her friend.

16:40.478 --> 16:42.442
(Whimpering)

16:44.404 --> 16:46.461
(Groaning)

16:46.462 --> 16:48.432
NICK:
Somebody help me!

16:48.433 --> 16:50.428
This is my nightmare!

16:50.429 --> 16:52.454
(High-pitched screaming)

16:53.662 --> 16:56.148
I didn't punch a girl.
I punched a horrifying monster.

16:56.399 --> 16:57.983
You of all people should
know this, Frankenstein.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.416
You're the real
monster.

17:00.417 --> 17:01.492
Oh, give me a break.

17:01.493 --> 17:03.399
Jess, are you okay?

17:03.400 --> 17:04.435
Yeah. It's nothing.

17:04.436 --> 17:05.496
Nick just punched
me in the face.

17:05.497 --> 17:07.462
- What?!
- Oh, my God! No, it was an acc...

17:07.464 --> 17:10.425
- What is wrong with you?
- Jess, I'm sorry!

17:10.428 --> 17:12.479
All right.
Look away.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.479
All right, well, the
bruise is going to heal,

17:17.480 --> 17:20.424
but I don't know what to do
about the giant stitches.

17:20.425 --> 17:21.467
I mean, those are
going to scar.

17:21.468 --> 17:23.403
And you're looking
a little pale.

17:23.404 --> 17:24.445
What have you
been eating?

17:24.446 --> 17:25.496
Brains.

17:30.492 --> 17:31.496
Habit.

17:33.446 --> 17:36.403
I think we should go.

17:36.404 --> 17:38.487
Sam. Uh, wait.

17:38.488 --> 17:41.453
Um... um...

17:41.454 --> 17:44.424
uh, I... I like you.

17:44.425 --> 17:46.404
- I like you, too, Jess.
- No, but, um...

17:46.407 --> 17:48.411
I care about you,

17:48.412 --> 17:52.491
and, um, I want
to ask you out for real.

17:52.492 --> 17:56.496
So... will you go out with me?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.429
I can't.

18:05.454 --> 18:08.399
I told you...

18:08.400 --> 18:10.412
what I wanted,
and I wasn't lying.

18:11.471 --> 18:12.491
Yeah, um...

18:12.492 --> 18:14.428
I just thought maybe

18:14.429 --> 18:16.408
- you were scared to say it.
- I'm not.

18:16.409 --> 18:17.475
Not scared, you know.

18:17.476 --> 18:20.400
This is how I feel.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.475
Do you want me to go?

18:35.458 --> 18:37.492
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:37.495 --> 18:39.428
You punch a girl?

18:39.429 --> 18:41.466
Yes, I did.
Uh, I'm a coward.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.411
I'm scared of
haunted houses.

18:43.412 --> 18:45.428
And I'm scared of you--
I always have been.

18:45.429 --> 18:48.399
That's right. That is what
I've been trying to remember.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.444
I was like, "Nick is great."

18:49.445 --> 18:51.425
Why didn't I
realize it years ago?"

18:51.426 --> 18:54.487
And it's because you could not
tell me how you felt.

18:54.488 --> 18:56.437
So you always knew
I liked you?

18:56.438 --> 18:59.399
You drove me home
every Thanksgiving break.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.441
You lived in Chicago;
I lived in Florida.

19:01.442 --> 19:02.496
Well, I was trying
to avoid the tolls.

19:02.497 --> 19:04.442
(Both chuckle)

19:06.458 --> 19:08.461
How do you feel about me now?

19:08.462 --> 19:10.411
(Stammers)

19:10.412 --> 19:12.407
Great. Good.

19:12.408 --> 19:13.494
I can't believe
that after all this time,

19:13.495 --> 19:15.492
you still can't be
honest with me.

19:15.493 --> 19:18.407
I'm sorry, all right?
It's my fault.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.407
Okay, I fell in
love with you

19:20.408 --> 19:22.407
the first time I saw
you-- that's crazy.

19:22.408 --> 19:24.488
I didn't even know you.
It was just this idea of you.

19:24.489 --> 19:28.471
And then... it just
wasn't what I thought.

19:30.450 --> 19:33.474
And what's up with
the way you kiss?

19:33.475 --> 19:36.408
It's like reverse CPR.
It's like you're...

19:37.488 --> 19:39.441
Hey.

19:39.442 --> 19:40.492
I'm not an idea of a person.

19:40.493 --> 19:42.475
I'm an actual person.

19:47.492 --> 19:48.496
- ROBBY: Okay.
- CECE: Ready? Uh-huh.

19:48.499 --> 19:50.428
BOTH:
One, two, three.

19:50.429 --> 19:51.461
(Both grunt)

19:52.913 --> 19:55.428
All right, let's try it one more time.
Let's see if we can hit the top.

19:55.429 --> 19:57.417
I think you guys deserve
the couples costumes.

19:57.418 --> 19:59.411
Bride and groom.

19:59.412 --> 20:01.429
- Aw.
- How sweet of you.

20:01.432 --> 20:03.438
- Thank you.
- Take the hat.

20:03.441 --> 20:05.457
It's... that's, like,
the most important part.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.450
- Very nice of you to do that, Schmidt.
- Hold this.

20:07.451 --> 20:09.456
Okay, I'm not... I don't need
to wear a second costume.

20:09.457 --> 20:11.446
This and the hat and the
blazer's enough, so that's...

20:11.447 --> 20:14.425
- You need it, Robby.
- Where you going with this here, buddy? I...

20:14.428 --> 20:16.467
- You're not going to... the pants, too?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:16.470 --> 20:18.479
- We're fine. We're good.
- It's important, man. Need to wear the whole thing.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.475
Just... what are
you going to wear?

20:20.476 --> 20:22.424
Plan B was always

20:22.425 --> 20:24.398
Matthew McConaughey
in Magic Mike, so...

20:24.399 --> 20:25.479
Always got to have
a plan B, Robby.

20:31.425 --> 20:33.458
Thanks, man.

20:35.429 --> 20:37.449
Wow. I mean,
look at his thighs.

20:37.450 --> 20:39.399
They're like fleshy
tree trunks.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.437
Whoa.

20:40.438 --> 20:42.482
I mean, he just knows
how to work the crowd.

20:42.483 --> 20:44.470
I mean, his thighs

20:44.471 --> 20:46.478
are, like, the size
of my head.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.425
- WOMAN: Reigning cats and dogs!
- SHELBY: Yeah!

20:49.428 --> 20:51.400
- Coat of arms.
- (Laughing)

20:51.401 --> 20:52.483
You are so awesome!

20:52.484 --> 20:56.457
You know, I may not
actually be Abraham Lincoln,

20:56.458 --> 20:58.474
but I witnessed
the emancipation

20:58.475 --> 21:00.478
of one black guy
tonight...

21:00.479 --> 21:03.432
from a terrible
relationship.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.438
Come on.

21:07.488 --> 21:10.399
I know I said you shouldn't
put yourself out there,

21:10.400 --> 21:11.496
but I'm glad you did.

21:11.497 --> 21:15.428
You should be with somebody
who's crazy about you, Jess.

21:15.429 --> 21:17.399
Thanks, Nick.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.453
That'd be really nice
if it wasn't coming

21:19.454 --> 21:21.495
from somebody who just
punched me in the face.

21:21.996 --> 21:23.487
Sorry about that.

21:23.488 --> 21:25.492
- SCHMIDT: All right, you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

21:25.995 --> 21:26.495
Let's do it.

21:26.496 --> 21:29.453
All right.
Let's do it.

21:30.204 --> 21:31.428
Okay.

21:31.429 --> 21:33.488
- Jess, let's make this right.
- All right.

21:37.492 --> 21:39.470
(Laughs)

21:39.971 --> 21:41.470
I can't do this.

21:42.971 --> 21:45.407
I'm glad you're you,
'cause Jess Day could...

21:45.408 --> 21:47.908
Ow! Mother of...
Damn it!
