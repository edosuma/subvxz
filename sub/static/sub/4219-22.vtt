WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.627
If you care about this woman,

00:02.753 --> 00:05.421
you're going to have
to put yourself out there.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.676
- Leslie...
- I'm calling the police.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.135
You think this is about the money?

00:11.261 --> 00:13.805
It's about her being a liar
and stepping on you.

00:13.931 --> 00:17.225
I'd like to ask for
your sister's hand in marriage.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.018
- Are you ready for your test?
- Yes, sir.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.438
Go!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.094
How do you feel?

00:54.138 --> 00:56.305
- Like I can do anything.
- Because you can.

00:56.432 --> 00:57.557
Oh, I can.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.475
- I can do this.
- Whatever it takes.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.144
Whatever it takes.

01:08.694 --> 01:09.819
Hello?

01:09.945 --> 01:11.320
Hello?

01:15.159 --> 01:16.826
Are they out?

01:16.952 --> 01:18.536
I don't know.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.331
- This is weird.
- Yeah.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.499
Way to go, Dawson!

01:33.844 --> 01:34.886
Mmm.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.596
Ah! I've never been
so turned on.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.433
Mmm.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.439
OK, you two,
let's talk in my office.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.109
Hey.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.030
I saw Devon stayed over last night.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.574
Yeah. Yeah.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.410
You know, it's temporary
until she finds a place.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.497
You're not really gonna
do this again, are you?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.415
I got it.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.501
I promise.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.380
So, good news, and, well...

02:12.466 --> 02:15.927
- What?
- They found you a home.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.763
You are going to 105 in Austin.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.351
Tommy Welch will be your Lieutenant.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.940
- It will be a challenge, no doubt.
- Yeah.

02:29.066 --> 02:32.318
But they have no idea of
the tornado that is coming.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.031
Thank you, Chief. Truly.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.201
Two shifts left.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.954
Hey.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.998
I'm gonna miss you here.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.000
We all are.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.801
Nothing we can do about her placement?

02:57.719 --> 03:00.930
- You want me to do something?
- They're setting her up to fail.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.140
And they will lose at that.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.360
Guys, we're going for a ride.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.612
Let's go.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.326
Herrmann, just the man
I'm looking for.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.453
Nothing good ever comes
out of that opening.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.498
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, you can judge it once I ask you.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.916
So, er...

03:32.838 --> 03:35.506
Donna and I are getting
married on Saturday.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.175
Just a small ceremony.

03:38.302 --> 03:42.263
I would like it very much
if you were to stand with me.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.518
That's just... That's great.
Of course I will.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.856
OK. Wow, OK, come on now.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.151
All right. All right.
Aren't we on shift on Saturday?

03:55.277 --> 03:57.695
Erm, would you mind
taking a personal day?

03:57.821 --> 03:59.822
It's just that her parents
were married on that day.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.950
- We think its destiny.
- Of course. Where?

04:03.076 --> 04:06.162
Er, she wanted a church wedding,
but it's all so last minute, so...

04:06.288 --> 04:09.874
Say no more, you're getting married
at St Ignatius in the big cathedral.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.043
I mean, I've had five kids
christened there.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.463
Father Dan loves me.
I'll take care of everything.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.797
Thank you, Chris.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.283
Hey, fellas.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.578
Hey. What's up?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.997
Is, er, Lieutenant Welch around?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.836
Thanks for the help.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.259
- Lieutenant.
- Hey, Matt Casey.

05:03.178 --> 05:08.683
So, er... it's official.
Dawson's coming here.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.061
I heard. Don't worry,
we got the streamers on order.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.479
Cake is on its way, too.

05:14.773 --> 05:18.484
Listen,
there's something you should know.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.194
Gabriela and I are together.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.365
Well, that's just perfect, isn't it?

05:25.283 --> 05:28.285
I just want to make sure she gets
the respect that she deserves.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.834
Well, then we promise
to take really good care of her.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.254
I appreciate that.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.013
I assume she can cook
and clean, right?

05:47.139 --> 05:49.932
Along with all the other
requisite female skills?

05:50.058 --> 05:51.267
I mean, you should know.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.605
Listen to me, Welch.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.483
She's not some load
who snaked her way through the academy.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.987
- She fought for this.
- You're not at 51, Casey.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.864
I don't need to hear any more speeches.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.284
No, no. What you need
is to get your ass whipped.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.037
- That's what you need.
- Lieutenant, we got a call.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.636
Oh, man.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.640
- What is it?
- St Mary's.

06:31.767 --> 06:32.808
It's a boarding school.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.446
Otis and Herrmann are with me.
Cruz and Mouch around back.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.865
Clock's ticking. Let's go!

06:47.991 --> 06:50.868
Battalion 25 to main,
I need a box alarm.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.287
- We have a fire, fully involved.
- Copy that.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.830
Me and Mills will take the top floor.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.832
Tony, Capp, Newhouse,
you guys take the second.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.418
- Let's go.
- Got everyone accounted for?

06:59.544 --> 07:02.755
I'm not sure. Some kids had free time
and weren't on campus.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.966
Let's go!

07:22.859 --> 07:25.486
Hey! You OK?

07:25.612 --> 07:28.989
- They're trapped in the common room.
- Get out of here.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.701
Fire department. Call out!

07:35.747 --> 07:37.039
There!

07:38.125 --> 07:39.458
Stay low and close.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.587
Stay low! Stay low!
Move out! Go.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.382
Get out of here!
I'm right behind you!

07:46.508 --> 07:48.467
- What about Chris?
- Take him!

07:48.593 --> 07:49.760
I got him!

07:49.886 --> 07:53.681
Come on. Come on! Let's go.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.266
Stay low.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.064
You have one minute. One minute.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.358
Copy that, Chief.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.529
Last hallway, let's go!

08:11.324 --> 08:14.118
Fire department!

08:18.999 --> 08:20.040
West wing's clear.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.424
Fire department! Call out!

08:32.095 --> 08:33.596
Anyone here? Call out!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.067
Hey, I'm all clear.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.236
I'm clear, too.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.910
OK, I'm calling it. Everybody out.
Pull back. Everybody out!

08:58.955 --> 09:01.207
I got one more, Chief.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.627
I got you, buddy. Easy! Easy.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.047
All right, we're gonna
get you out of here.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.767
Second floor's all clear.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.186
Severide, what's your status?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.439
Hey, you hear that?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.943
Get down!

09:32.280 --> 09:34.031
Severide, talk to me.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.952
Severide, Mills.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.286
Talk to me now.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.996
Severide, talk to me.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.256
Severide, talk to me now!

10:05.689 --> 10:07.189
Top floor's all clear, Chief!

10:07.315 --> 10:10.693
OK, everybody, fall back.
Let's go defensive.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.532
Lacerations to the abdomen.
Glass is still inside the wound.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.534
Fire up the water cannons.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.926
Few more minutes,
and then I want a secondary search

10:36.052 --> 10:37.803
for any fire lurking in the walls.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.221
You got it, Chief.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.599
I don't know. I had one date I liked,
but then I guess I blew it.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.978
- She hasn't called me in weeks.
- One date's not that bad.

10:46.104 --> 10:49.648
Maybe I just won't find what I had
with Mari again, you know?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.735
Maybe that's just one of those
once-in-a-lifetime type things.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.820
Pssh!

10:56.364 --> 10:57.573
What's up, Herrmann?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.575
I can't tell you.

11:00.410 --> 11:04.496
- Seriously?
- OK, but it goes no further.

11:04.622 --> 11:09.209
OK? Boden's getting married
to Donna on Saturday.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.212
- What?
- And I just promised him my church.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.673
- Boden's marrying Donna?
- Shh!

11:16.092 --> 11:17.760
Well, good for him.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.932
- You've already screwed this up.
- Yeah, OK?

11:24.059 --> 11:27.186
And I just heard Father Dan
use the word "impossible"

11:27.312 --> 11:29.938
when I asked him if I could use
the cathedral on Saturday.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.483
Did you ever hear a priest
use that word?

11:32.609 --> 11:33.859
Actually, I have.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.155
I ask the tough questions.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.617
Hey, er, Newhouse,
I got a question for you.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.743
Shoot.

11:42.869 --> 11:47.456
Well, er, my dad died
when I was little

11:47.582 --> 11:49.625
in a building fire
like this one, actually.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.044
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, hey, it was a long time ago.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.297
But my mom sort of kept me
from that side of the family.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.549
From what she says,
they weren't all that nice to her.

11:57.675 --> 12:01.303
My dad's side, it's always been
this black hole to me.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.847
Look, I do this type of thing
all the time, man.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.475
It's, er, more legwork than keystrokes,
if you know what I mean.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.812
- I mean, I'll pay you for your time.
- No, man, just buy me a few beers,

12:09.938 --> 12:12.147
and know I'm a hell of a drinker.

12:13.108 --> 12:13.982
Done.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.404
Fire's out, Chief.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.031
Shut down the water cannons.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.201
OK, men, look for anything smouldering
in the walls or the ceilings.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.828
Come on. Let's go.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.086
Ah! Hey, is there some
sort of trick to this?

12:34.212 --> 12:37.089
Yeah.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.969
Experience.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.932
All right, start pulling.
Check everything.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.074
- Damn.
- Severide.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.422
He's alive.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.101
We got him, we got him.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.076
I... I swept that room, Chief.

13:50.371 --> 13:54.416
- I remember the bicycle. I was...
- Kelly, let it go.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.405
What's this?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.627
It's as-is. I don't want
any confusion about that.

14:39.504 --> 14:40.546
No confusion.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.010
Bought it cheap.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.637
I'd hope so.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.362
Did you tell Boden
you can't get the church yet?

15:05.488 --> 15:08.574
What? Who told you that?

15:11.953 --> 15:15.247
I haven't played all my angles.
I'm working on it.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.666
- Tick, tick, tick, tick.
- I'm working on it!

15:17.792 --> 15:20.711
I just have to go back to Father Dan,
and, you know,

15:20.837 --> 15:24.298
make a donation to
the annex fund or something.

15:26.884 --> 15:30.470
Dude, you don't mess with a bride
and groom on their wedding day.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.057
You have to tell him now
so that he can make other arrangements.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.727
Unless you want
a Game of Thrones Red Wedding.

15:36.853 --> 15:40.939
- What does that mean?
- Blood on the floor.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.482
No one survives.

16:00.710 --> 16:04.338
- Hey, Chief, you... You got a minute?
- Yeah.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.258
- How... How you doing?
- Worried about Severide.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.471
- Yeah. Erm...
- I am so grateful.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.514
What you're doing for me
with this church hook-up.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.224
It's one less thing
for me to worry about.

16:16.351 --> 16:22.105
Of course, Chief.
Erm... that's what best men are for.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.025
Yeah.
What did you want to talk to me about?

16:25.151 --> 16:28.362
Er, nothing. Nothing, really.

16:28.488 --> 16:33.700
I just, you know, wanted to thank you
for trusting me with this.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.703
- Yeah.
- OK.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.246
Thanks.

16:44.629 --> 16:45.796
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:45.922 --> 16:49.299
I called, er, I called to check on
the kid from the school.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.761
- Don't. Don't.
- Well, his name's Cory Jefferson.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.097
- You want to go see him?
- No.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.975
- There's nothing I can do.
- OK.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.898
- Did you buy a bike?
- I did. See, I'm OK.

17:05.024 --> 17:10.404
So maybe, since you're OK,
we can talk about Devon later.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.407
I'm not sure I'm ever gonna be that OK.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.660
Copy that.

17:23.668 --> 17:24.751
Hey.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.638
Two more shifts till
I turn my jump bag in.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.016
You're gonna miss that jump bag.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.644
I'm not going to miss picking up
vomiting kids on rush,

17:42.770 --> 17:45.105
I'll tell you that.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.693
But this house...

17:51.779 --> 17:54.698
This shift, Shay...

17:57.285 --> 18:00.287
Yeah, I'm gonna miss that.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.555
I'm even going to miss
those damn bells.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.982
I know.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.401
Every call feels like
it could be the last.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.904
I'm going to put my picture
right above the steering wheel

18:34.030 --> 18:35.113
so you don't forget me.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.824
For when Chout's your partner.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.579
Over here! This way!

18:54.342 --> 18:56.009
Hey, guys?
Grab three backboards.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.221
- Got it!
- Looks like a drug deal gone bad.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.306
Main, we're going to need
two additional ambos.

19:01.432 --> 19:04.935
Copy that, 61. More ambos
en route to your location.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.482
Through and through over here.
Pulse is weak.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.860
- There had to be a fourth guy here.
- You guys see anyone?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.654
There were a couple
of skaters over there.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.738
I think they called it in.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.993
- Guys! There he is.
- Stop! CPD!

19:22.119 --> 19:24.412
Bullet to the upper abdomen.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.506
Dawson!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.093
Shay.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.599
No exit wound.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.185
Left side's diminished.
Bullet must have travelled to lungs.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.437
All right, let's decompress him
now or he's dead.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.528
Got it.

20:12.670 --> 20:19.175
Yep, I'll owe you one for sure.
Can you hold that for a day?

20:19.302 --> 20:21.928
Yeah, that's all I need.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.264
Thanks.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.601
Hey.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.229
- What can I do for you, Matt?
- Firehouse 87 at Logan Square.

20:31.355 --> 20:35.191
There's an opening.
It's Dawson's if you say yes.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.612
- She's asked for this?
- Not exactly.

20:38.738 --> 20:43.366
She deserves better than serving
under Welch as her first assignment.

20:48.664 --> 20:53.293
- I'm OK with this if she is, too.
- Thanks, Chief.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.507
My sister asked if
we wanted to visit next week.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.843
She said she's got
a new pizza oven or something.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.304
- She wants to try it out on us.
- Sounds great.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.518
Hey, babe, your phone's buzzing.
No caller ID.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.271
- Can you answer it and take a message?
- Yeah.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.733
- Thanks, babe.
- Hello?

21:22.865 --> 21:25.116
My ring?

21:28.162 --> 21:31.039
Yeah, I will... I will tell him.
Thank you.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.627
Was it some guy named Mazin?

21:35.753 --> 21:38.880
I got to do an estimate on
some garage repairs for him.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.634
- Er, no, I didn't get to it in time.
- We'll bring dessert.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.844
Great.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.854
How you feeling, Kelly?

21:54.981 --> 21:57.273
Be a hell of a lot better
when people stop asking me that.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.958
Yeah.

22:49.785 --> 22:55.248
Er, excuse me. Any word on this patient?
I was one of the firemen.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.418
He's critical. We're not hopeful.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.504
OK.

23:03.424 --> 23:07.093
Er, do you know...
Do you know how old he is?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.511
Ten.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.699
Looking for the beer?

23:29.825 --> 23:32.160
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I finished the last one

23:32.286 --> 23:33.495
and meant to go get some more,

23:33.621 --> 23:36.039
but then I got a call
from my dad's attorney...

23:36.165 --> 23:38.833
Yeah, yeah.
Of course you did.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.753
You don't have to be a dick about it.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.173
- I'm not getting into it with you.
- There's nothing to get into.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.801
I admitted I made a mistake,
and you treated me rudely.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.761
I treated you rudely?

23:50.513 --> 23:54.015
You left here like a coward
in the middle of the night.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.809
- I...
- Shut it!

23:55.935 --> 23:59.187
Not to mention you rolled us
for about five grand,

23:59.313 --> 24:01.689
so excuse me if my fuse
is about this short

24:01.816 --> 24:03.483
since you slinked
your way back in here.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.945
You don't know anything about me,
so you can save your big man routine.

24:07.071 --> 24:10.865
I know you're a thief, a loser.
I know you're bad news for Shay.

24:10.991 --> 24:14.702
So why don't you just
take your stuff, your stuff,

24:14.829 --> 24:17.956
and crawl back to wherever
the hell you came from, huh?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.503
What's going on?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.846
He just blew up like that.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.775
Thanks.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.321
You OK?

24:56.453 --> 24:58.121
What's going on, Kelly?

24:59.748 --> 25:01.416
Just one of those days.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.918
Come on.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.720
I gave an all-clear
at a school fire today...

25:16.557 --> 25:20.143
...and when we went to do
the secondary search,

25:20.269 --> 25:25.940
we found a kid... badly burned.

25:27.401 --> 25:33.198
- I'm so sorry.
- I was... moving too fast.

25:33.991 --> 25:38.119
Too many rooms, not enough time.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.667
He's ten.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.129
The kid's only ten.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.301
It's not your fault.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.970
I don't... I don't know that.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.229
I'll never know that.

26:17.576 --> 26:24.582
So my first week in uniform,
I walk into a 7-Eleven,

26:24.708 --> 26:28.795
and I walk right up behind this kid
stealing a candy bar.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.382
He turned around
and he just froze when he saw me,

26:32.508 --> 26:38.471
and then he reached
in his pocket real slow,

26:38.597 --> 26:40.181
put it back.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.351
No harm, no foul, right?

26:44.812 --> 26:46.521
So I didn't say anything
and he took off.

26:46.647 --> 26:52.360
And I got whatever stupid thing I was
getting, and then I heard gunshots.

26:52.486 --> 26:55.238
I ran outside and I see
two bangers driving away,

26:55.364 --> 26:57.949
and there's the kid.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.451
He's just laying dead in the alley.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.084
And I've thought about it
a thousand times.

27:10.212 --> 27:14.882
Why didn't I stop him,
talk to him, arrest him even?

27:15.009 --> 27:17.635
You know, he'd still be alive today.

27:20.264 --> 27:23.725
And even though it wasn't my fault...

27:25.561 --> 27:27.603
...it doesn't make it hurt any less.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.207
What's up with you?

27:48.334 --> 27:51.252
Urgh, Severide blew up
at Devon and took off.

27:51.378 --> 27:55.048
- Ah. Is he OK?
- Yeah. It's Kelly.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.841
How's anybody to know?

27:59.470 --> 28:02.722
- So...
- Yes, go on.

28:03.932 --> 28:07.852
OK, I picked up Casey's phone,

28:07.978 --> 28:12.231
and a jewellery store said,
and I quote, "The ring is ready."

28:16.153 --> 28:19.530
You knew about this?
Don't... Don't you lie to me.

28:19.656 --> 28:24.869
He asked me about it.
Don't make me say anything more.

28:24.995 --> 28:28.873
- Oh, God.
- What? Are you not happy?

28:28.999 --> 28:32.293
No, yeah, of course I am.
I think.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.961
All right, listen up, everybody!

28:34.088 --> 28:36.381
Hey! Hey! Shh.

28:36.507 --> 28:40.218
When I first met Gabriela Dawson,
I thought to myself,

28:40.344 --> 28:43.054
"What's wrong with this chick?"

28:43.180 --> 28:45.348
And now she's a candidate
to be a fire-fighter,

28:45.474 --> 28:47.558
and I figured it out.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.353
To Dawson!

28:52.606 --> 28:54.816
- Worst toast ever.
- Boo.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.568
To Dawson! Give 'em hell, candidate.

29:01.532 --> 29:02.740
Cheers, babe.

29:05.619 --> 29:06.994
- Come here.
- OK.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.836
- I have some news.
- News?

29:14.962 --> 29:18.923
- Not a question?
- Well, a question too, yeah.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.342
OK.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.595
- How much do you love me?
- Erm...

29:24.721 --> 29:27.723
A lot?

29:27.850 --> 29:30.643
Good. Expect to love me more.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.854
I want you...

29:37.276 --> 29:39.026
...to think about this.

29:39.153 --> 29:44.449
This is a transfer request
which has already been approved.

29:44.575 --> 29:49.287
I want you to consider not going to
Austin and go to Logan Square instead.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.955
- Matt.
- Just hear me out.

29:51.081 --> 29:55.293
Starting at any new place is difficult,
and you deserve...

29:55.419 --> 29:57.587
To be treated like
every other candidate.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.923
- Gabby, I...
- He's not gonna break me, Matt.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.386
I can promise you that.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.907
- You want a drink?
- A beer.

30:26.742 --> 30:30.161
Hey, this is the file
I was telling you about.

30:30.287 --> 30:31.662
It's just a couple of pictures,

30:31.788 --> 30:34.165
my birth certificate,
a letter that my dad wrote once.

30:34.291 --> 30:37.627
- So this is your father, huh?
- Yeah, that's him.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.086
All right.

30:39.213 --> 30:41.923
Just don't kill the messenger
if the news ain't rainbows.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.091
Not at all.

30:48.931 --> 30:51.641
You look peaked.

30:51.767 --> 30:56.812
You still haven't told Boden that
you've ruined his wedding?

30:56.939 --> 30:58.773
- Who told you?
- Cruz.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.403
What the hell am I gonna do, Mouch?

31:04.530 --> 31:09.367
You're married to an amazing woman,
Herrmann.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.702
Yeah, so?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.829
Let's come to grips with the fact

31:13.956 --> 31:19.168
that this is not a job
for a mortal man, but for a wife.

32:01.587 --> 32:07.258
- You're the fire-fighter, right?
- Yeah.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.551
He made a turn for the better.

32:08.677 --> 32:11.512
Parents have been crying
with joy for ten minutes.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.746
Here we go.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.169
Hey, Chief, I got to,
er, tell you something.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.800
- Oh, no.
- The cathedral fell through.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.969
I tried to strong-arm Father Dan,

32:52.095 --> 32:54.305
but they got this AA meeting over there,
and they pay rent.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.349
- Why didn't you tell me?!
- I tried!

32:56.475 --> 32:58.517
But, you know, you were so excited
and all, and...

33:04.399 --> 33:06.609
Hey, Donna.

33:06.735 --> 33:09.362
No, I was just getting
the lowdown from Christopher.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.031
No, I know you're upset.
I'm upset.

33:12.157 --> 33:16.452
No, Donna, please,
listen, where are you?

33:17.454 --> 33:22.875
Why are you there? OK, look, just stay
there, and I am coming to you, OK?

33:24.836 --> 33:27.797
- She's at the firehouse.
- Why would she go to the firehouse?

33:27.923 --> 33:29.215
I don't know!

33:35.847 --> 33:35.930
How come you always know a guy?

33:35.931 --> 33:38.974
How come you always know a guy?

33:39.101 --> 33:43.604
- Christopher, today, of all days.
- It'll be really easy.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.482
- They got folding chairs.
- I'm done with you.

34:02.624 --> 34:06.502
Did you really think that I was gonna
let you get married without 51?

34:07.629 --> 34:10.131
Hurry up, Chief!
She ain't waiting forever!

34:10.257 --> 34:14.427
Let's go!

34:18.140 --> 34:21.058
You all knew?
You didn't tell me, huh?

34:26.815 --> 34:29.775
- You can do this?
- Yeah, certified online yesterday.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.604
Yeah, Chief!

35:48.730 --> 35:50.773
Yeah, Chief.

36:00.242 --> 36:01.784
There you go.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.677
- Oh, oops.
- I am sorry.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.638
Sorry, my bad. I'm sorry.

36:22.764 --> 36:28.227
- Er, no, you... You first.
- Thanks.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.812
You've got a little...
Do you mind...

36:29.938 --> 36:31.188
Mmm.

36:32.983 --> 36:33.983
- Get it?
- Yeah.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.569
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

36:36.695 --> 36:41.240
So you're a fire-fire...
Fire-fighter here?

36:41.366 --> 36:48.414
- 33 years.
- Er... Trudy Platt.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.835
- Randy McHolland.
- Nice to meet you.

37:18.278 --> 37:20.613
Gabriela Dawson...

37:23.909 --> 37:28.037
...you are the strongest, most
single-minded woman I've ever known.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.291
I'm a lucky man
to have you in my life,

37:32.417 --> 37:35.085
and I want to make sure
that we're together forever.

37:42.344 --> 37:44.887
Will you marry me?

37:55.148 --> 37:57.691
Truck 81, Ambo 61, Engine 51...

37:57.817 --> 37:59.526
Don't answer like this.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.489
Real never waits, does it?

38:03.615 --> 38:06.784
- Oh, go.
- Are you sure?

38:06.910 --> 38:10.037
Husband and a hero,
best wedding story ever.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.625
Love you.
Kenny, can I ride with you?

38:20.840 --> 38:23.842
Let's go!

38:46.199 --> 38:47.741
Engine's five minutes out.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.160
Probably just a rubbish fire,
but let's keep it in check.

38:50.286 --> 38:53.747
Truck 81, Recon, knock it out
with some silver bullets.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.290
Squad, search and rescue.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.334
All right, you heard him.
Let's move.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.800
Hey.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.428
I'm sorry.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.098
- I love you, you know?
- I know. I love you, too.

39:11.224 --> 39:15.561
- We'll figure this out?
- Yeah, always.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.861
Men, huh?

39:23.987 --> 39:26.113
Being a gay woman,
you'd think I'd be done with them.

39:27.073 --> 39:30.284
Hey. Casey asked me to marry him.

39:30.410 --> 39:34.371
- And?
- And duty called.

39:34.497 --> 39:39.460
- You guys are gonna be great together.
- Yeah, we are.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.170
Hitting floor two now.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.880
Little more fire here.

39:43.006 --> 39:46.175
Got a victim on the first floor,
fell down some stairs.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.844
- Possible spinal injury.
- We're on it.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.680
Mouch and Cruz are on the roof,
