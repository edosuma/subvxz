00:16.233 --> 00:18.500
You lost your virginity
in your parents' basement

00:18.533 --> 00:19.700
while watching
The Notebook?

00:19.733 --> 00:21.000
At least it's romantic.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.500
Chick flick.

00:22.533 --> 00:23.667
And what's the connection

00:23.700 --> 00:25.467
between 9/11
and first hand job?

00:25.500 --> 00:27.367
Both happened while I was
on the bus to middle school.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.867
That was a busy bus.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.700
And while you were giving
birth to Caitlin?

00:30.733 --> 00:32.800
Younger Liza was going
to her first concert--

00:32.833 --> 00:34.167
Spice Girls,
Asbury Park.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.200
I dressed as Sporty,

00:35.233 --> 00:36.533
though right now
I feel scary.

00:36.567 --> 00:37.533
Do not let fear get in.

00:37.567 --> 00:38.633
You're doing this.

00:38.667 --> 00:39.667
And you're staying with me,

00:39.700 --> 00:40.867
so I can live vicariously.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.233
I'm nothing but
a lab rat to you.

00:42.267 --> 00:44.533
A hot lab rat with
a fancy new job.

00:44.567 --> 00:45.867
(man)
Hey!

00:45.900 --> 00:47.200
Who's ready to go
off the grid?

00:50.200 --> 00:53.133
Oh, look how cute
Caitlin was then.

00:53.167 --> 00:55.200
Look at you and David.
You actually look happy there.

00:55.233 --> 00:56.967
We were on vacation
together in the Bahamas,

00:57.000 --> 00:58.567
where I later discovered
he gambled away

00:58.600 --> 00:59.633
Caitlin's college fund.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.700
- Memories.
- Mmm.

01:00.733 --> 01:02.100
Are you sure about this?

01:02.133 --> 01:03.367
Because when I erase
your internet presence,

01:03.400 --> 01:04.367
you're gone forever.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.567
I have to do it.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.567
I can't have the
people I work with

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
finding my life online.

01:07.633 --> 01:08.800
I don't need the details.

01:08.833 --> 01:10.533
Wait, wait.
I'm getting a message.

01:10.567 --> 01:11.933
Don't worry.

01:11.967 --> 01:13.800
That bitch will
never find you again.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.133
That bitch
was my daughter.

01:18.833 --> 01:20.067
Honey, hey,
I got your message.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.533
Is everything okay?

01:21.567 --> 01:23.067
(Caitlin)
Mom, I don't want to come home.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.567
I want to finish out
the school year in India.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.133
(Liza)
Are you sure?

01:26.167 --> 01:27.600
I don't want you to stay
if you're unhappy.

01:27.633 --> 01:28.867
(Caitlin)
No, I'm not unhappy.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.267
In fact, I'm very happy.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.733
I met someone.

01:32.767 --> 01:35.233
His name is Arjun,
and he's beautiful.

01:35.267 --> 01:37.567
His lips are like pillows.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.800
That's great, honey,

01:38.833 --> 01:39.800
and very descriptive.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.300
Is he in class with you?

01:41.333 --> 01:42.467
(Caitlin)
Of course he's in class with me.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.900
He's this premed genius,

01:43.933 --> 01:46.567
and he wants to take me
to Goa this weekend.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.533
Honey, I'm glad you're staying,

01:48.567 --> 01:50.967
but I don't want you going to
Goa with a pillow-lipped genius.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.533
(Caitlin)
Mom, how can you
make decisions for me

01:53.567 --> 01:55.200

01:55.233 --> 01:56.633
Caitlin, I love you,

01:56.667 --> 01:58.900
and I am very glad you
met a boy that you like,

01:58.933 --> 02:00.367
but listen to me carefully:

02:00.400 --> 02:03.200
do not go to Goa.

02:03.233 --> 02:04.867
(Josh)
I'll go to Goa.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.433
In fact, I would love
to go-a to Goa with you.

02:07.467 --> 02:08.833
Uh, honey,
you're breaking up.

02:08.866 --> 02:10.833
We will talk about
this later, okay?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.333
Excuse me, sir,
are you stalking me?

02:15.367 --> 02:17.000
Actually, I thought
you were stalking me.

02:17.033 --> 02:18.633
I mean, this is my studio

02:18.667 --> 02:20.600
that you just happened to
be loitering in front of, so...

02:20.633 --> 02:22.000
We're neighbors.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.800
I bet that's probably
why we met at the bar

02:23.833 --> 02:25.800
around the corner.

02:25.833 --> 02:28.533
So, neighbor,
what's going on?

02:28.567 --> 02:29.667
You got any plans tonight?

02:29.700 --> 02:30.967
You want to take a stroll?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.033
A stroll?

02:32.067 --> 02:33.333
Yeah, through the burgh.

02:33.367 --> 02:34.800
I'll show you all the sights.

02:34.833 --> 02:36.700
I would so love to
take a stroll with you,

02:36.733 --> 02:39.267
but right now I am
very late for this job

02:39.300 --> 02:41.767

02:41.800 --> 02:42.867

03:04.200 --> 03:05.400
And you're telling
me this now,

03:05.433 --> 03:07.167
one week before
the book comes out?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.567
No, no, no.
We'll deal with it.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.067
What choice do we have?

03:11.100 --> 03:12.900
That is just effin' perfect.

03:12.933 --> 03:15.067
Joyce Carol Oates writes
the best book of her career

03:15.100 --> 03:18.233
and Sue Grafton moves the
release of her new mystery

03:18.267 --> 03:19.700
to the same date.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.533
She can't hold a candle
to Joyce Carol Oates.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.533
I actually wrote a paper
about her in college.

03:23.567 --> 03:26.433
Joyce Carol Oates
and the Riddling Nature
of Female Desire.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.000
Well that sounds like a
riveting marketing plan to me.

03:29.033 --> 03:30.000
Well, how are the reviews?

03:30.033 --> 03:31.333
I bet they're amazing.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.433
Oh, and do you think
reviews sell books?

03:33.467 --> 03:35.500
No, your generation has
absolutely destroyed

03:35.533 --> 03:37.100
all pretense of
critical relevance.

03:40.733 --> 03:42.267
by Michiko Kakutani
could sell books

03:42.300 --> 03:44.733
is if her twerking
ass caught fire.

a number-one debut.

by Diana. Why?

I'm supposed to meet Lauren,

04:35.433 --> 04:37.267
and I could really use your
help keeping her entertained

Okay.

Hector and Dorf
made the most insane video

04:53.433 --> 04:55.233
for their new underwear line.

04:55.267 --> 04:57.333
First you think you're looking
at a giant furry penis,

04:57.367 --> 04:59.100
and then it suddenly stands up

04:59.133 --> 05:02.967
and you realize it is actually
a golden retriever puppy.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.567
So many of your
stories involve penises.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.300
It's totally gone viral.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.667
Oh, cool.
Is there, like, an app for that?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.167
So, like, no.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.900
Hector and Dorf are
avant-garde fashion visionaries,

05:12.933 --> 05:15.467

Are you really just
gonna sit here

and read your Swedish book?

05:18.267 --> 05:19.333
Yeah.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.800
I would love to see that video.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.200
Yeah, no, no, no,
I'll send it to you with a--

05:22.233 --> 05:23.667
oh, with some of
our new moisturizer.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.000
You're developing
crow's-feet.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.067
That is very unusual
for women our age.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.500
Yeah, I know, I know.

05:28.533 --> 05:31.000
We have this premature
eye wrinkle thing

05:31.033 --> 05:32.200
on my mother's side

05:32.233 --> 05:33.567
and I spent way too much time

05:33.600 --> 05:34.900
on the beaches in Goa.

05:37.433 --> 05:39.000
The--uh, what you doing there?

05:39.033 --> 05:40.133

I do not believe this.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.633
Lauren's boobs are
trending on Twitter.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.933
No way.
Trending?

06:17.967 --> 06:19.433
That's good, right?

How?

06:31.667 --> 06:33.267
Okay, I have a crazy idea.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.967
There are no crazy ideas,
only bad ones.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.633
Do you really want
to pitch me a bad idea?

06:37.667 --> 06:40.700
You want to get Joyce Carol
Oates attention on social media.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.033
Move the release of
her book to Tuesday.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.367
Why would we do that?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.967

06:46.000 --> 06:47.200
Excuse me?

06:47.233 --> 06:48.767

It's a huge deal.

selfies on Twitter

06:50.900 --> 06:52.900
to support
female empowerment.

with our fans on social media.

in our cultural coffin.

of 70% dark chocolate.

I was in Asia.

I started apprenticing

for this guy in Tokyo

07:55.467 --> 07:59.267
who was like this
master tattoo artist.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.200
I love that story.

08:01.233 --> 08:03.033
That's why I totally dig
that you lived in India

08:03.067 --> 08:04.667
for all those years, you know?

08:04.700 --> 08:06.033
Well, yeah.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.567
Yeah, living in
a third-world country

08:07.600 --> 08:09.167
really changes your perspective.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.400
I miss it so much.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.667
- Look at this guy.
- * Beyond the sea

08:21.700 --> 08:23.600
He just drives around the city

08:23.633 --> 08:25.833
just singing.

08:25.867 --> 08:28.033
* My lover stands
on golden sands *

08:28.067 --> 08:30.400
- He's terrible.
- Yeah, I know.

08:30.433 --> 08:32.933
* And watches the ships

08:32.967 --> 08:36.600
* That go sailing

08:36.633 --> 08:38.332
- Meatballs.
- What?

08:38.366 --> 08:39.667
Best meatballs in Brooklyn.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.567
Just stay right here.
I will be right back.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.067
(woman)
Liza?

08:45.100 --> 08:47.533
Oh, my God.
Michelle, Tom!

08:47.567 --> 08:48.700
Oh!

08:48.733 --> 08:50.667
Where have you been?

08:50.700 --> 08:51.933
You moved,

08:51.967 --> 08:53.733
and you disappeared
from Facebook.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.367
I have been so
worried about you.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.700
Yeah, I've been staying
with my friend Maggie.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.100
She lives nearby.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.833
The lesbian artist?

09:00.867 --> 09:02.467
You could have
stayed with me.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.633
What are you guys
doing here?

09:03.667 --> 09:05.267
Oh, every month we
come to Brooklyn

09:05.300 --> 09:06.833
to try out a hot
new restaurant.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.933
Well, by "hot,"
she means "overpriced."

09:08.967 --> 09:12.833
You know, we should
introduce Liza to Richard.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.900
Richard
is an absolute catch,

09:14.933 --> 09:17.067
also recently divorced.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.733
- Promise me you'll call.
- I swear.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.133
Oh!

09:20.167 --> 09:23.133
Liza, it's so
good to see you!

09:23.167 --> 09:26.300
Oh, don't be a stranger.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.067
Okay.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.233
It's straight ahead.
It's straight ahead to the left.

09:30.267 --> 09:32.400
Can't miss it.

09:32.433 --> 09:33.767
Who's that?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.767
Oh, yeah, uh,
it's just some older woman

09:35.800 --> 09:37.667
looking for directions
for the subway.

09:37.700 --> 09:38.667
And she kissed you?

09:38.700 --> 09:41.100
Yeah.
She was very...

09:41.133 --> 09:43.567
French.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.433
Oh.

09:46.467 --> 09:49.767
OMG,
mouth-gasm.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.333
- Oh, my God.
- They're the best.

09:51.367 --> 09:52.633
- Right?
- Yeah.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.167
Babe, I can't.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.767
I have to finish
reading this book.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.767
Why are you staying over

10:02.800 --> 10:04.600
if you just want to read?

10:04.633 --> 10:06.000
Good air conditioning

10:06.033 --> 10:08.300
and better sheets.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.133
What, I can only stay here
if I have sex with you?

10:10.167 --> 10:11.333
No, babe.

10:11.367 --> 10:13.667
It's just been
three whole days.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.300
Okay, well, why don't you
read something for once?

10:16.333 --> 10:18.433
That copy of The Goldfinch
has been on your nightstand

10:18.467 --> 10:19.933
for over a year.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.500
In 400 pages.

10:30.533 --> 10:31.733
Okay?

10:31.767 --> 10:33.167
I promise.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.000
(Josh) Okay,
so this is where you live.

10:46.033 --> 10:48.600
(Liza) Yep,
with my roommate, Maggie.

10:48.633 --> 10:50.100
She's a really
awesome artist.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.433
Multidisciplinary.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.500
Some might describe
her work as really--

10:59.300 --> 11:00.600
Ahh.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.567
One more thing you
should know about me...

11:08.700 --> 11:10.667
I'm all about work
right now.

11:10.700 --> 11:13.533
So no time, really,
for personal life.

11:13.567 --> 11:15.400
Didn't like the kiss,
huh?

11:15.433 --> 11:16.567
Of course not.
No.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.167
God, no.
I loved the kiss.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.000
It was superb.
You're an excellent kisser.

11:20.033 --> 11:21.400
Best kiss
I've had in years.

11:21.433 --> 11:23.133
Seriously.
I mean it.

11:23.167 --> 11:24.400
But I--

11:24.433 --> 11:25.700
Yeah.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.667
The work thing.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.067
I got it.

11:32.033 --> 11:35.567
I will try and keep
my distance, neighbor.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.067
Okay.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.167
Neighbor.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.900
* You bring a joy with you

11:41.933 --> 11:46.867
* A certain peace
that's hard to find *

11:46.900 --> 11:49.300
* I never knew
someone like you *

11:49.333 --> 11:50.600
* Who sees me clear
as sky is blue *

11:58.933 --> 12:00.600
- Morning.
- Hey.

12:00.633 --> 12:02.433
How was your date
with Josh last night?

12:02.467 --> 12:04.033
It wasn't a date.

12:04.067 --> 12:06.933
It was more
of a neighborly tour.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.533
That kiss was
very neighborly.

12:09.567 --> 12:10.600
You saw that?

12:10.633 --> 12:11.733
Hmm!
I felt that.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.433
And I was two floors up.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.033
Yeah.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.967
I don't need any more
trouble in my life right now.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.133
Well, one woman's trouble
is another woman's fantasy.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.900
My fantasy is
restarting my career,

12:20.933 --> 12:22.200
not macking on
some sweet kid

12:22.233 --> 12:23.800
who would take tattoo
needles to his eyes

12:23.833 --> 12:25.433
if he knew how old I was.

12:25.467 --> 12:27.767
That kiss was hot,
though.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.800
It was so hot.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.433
It's never gonna
happen again.

12:32.467 --> 12:33.433
Ever.

12:33.467 --> 12:34.433
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

12:34.467 --> 12:36.067
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

12:42.400 --> 12:43.733
(Kelsey)
Liza!

12:43.767 --> 12:46.067
Oh, God, I finally
finished that book.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.700
- Did you read it?
- I'm so sorry, I didn't.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.633
I had kind of a date
with Josh last night.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.700
Ooh, that hottie
you met at the bar?

12:51.733 --> 12:52.900
Yeah.

12:52.933 --> 12:54.300
God, at least one
of us is having fun.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.467
Thad masturbated
next to me all night,

12:56.500 --> 12:58.700
but I did not let him
break my concentration.

12:58.733 --> 13:00.200
Wow, I wish I had
your focus.

13:00.233 --> 13:01.667
How was the book?

13:01.700 --> 13:03.667
You know, the translation
is a little stilted,

13:03.700 --> 13:05.667
but he is amazing.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.933
The book is about his life,

13:06.967 --> 13:09.633
but he makes every
detail feel universal.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.200
I'll finish it tonight.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.300
If I can sign this guy,

13:12.333 --> 13:14.067
it will change
everything for me.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.000
Where have you been?
I've been e-mailing
you all morning.

13:24.033 --> 13:25.467
I'm sorry,
it's 8:00 a.m.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.300
I didn't realize
all morning had started yet.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.300
We have a photo shoot.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.000
ShowUsYourOates.

13:30.033 --> 13:31.000
Seriously?

13:31.033 --> 13:32.267
I'm always serious.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.733
Haven't you figured
that out by now?

13:45.333 --> 13:47.300
So are we gonna get
to meet Joyce today?

13:47.333 --> 13:49.000
No.

13:49.033 --> 13:50.000
Not today.

13:50.033 --> 13:51.033
[cell phone rings]

13:51.067 --> 13:52.333
Sorry.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.667
Michelle.

13:55.700 --> 13:56.767
(Michelle)
Lizey.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.133
Guess who saw your picture

13:58.167 --> 13:59.767
and really wants
to go on a date with you.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.333
Tom's very available
friend Richard.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.500
Wow, that's very nice,
but I don't think I want to--

14:04.533 --> 14:05.667
(Michelle)
Oh, Liza, honey,

14:05.700 --> 14:06.933
listen to me.

14:06.967 --> 14:08.700
What happened
with you and David

14:08.733 --> 14:09.767
is terrible,

14:09.800 --> 14:12.167
and losing that beautiful house.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.400
But you need to take a chance,

14:13.433 --> 14:15.167
and I can vouch for this man.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.567
Recently divorced,

14:16.600 --> 14:17.733
very good looking,

14:17.767 --> 14:19.167
owns his own business.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.367
- Wow.
- Honey, this is good for you.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.367
Just say yes.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.667
Okay. Okay, okay.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.100
Just give him my number.

14:25.133 --> 14:26.567
(Michelle)
Fabulous.

14:29.233 --> 14:32.567
Wonderful.
This is all very empowering.

14:39.533 --> 14:40.500
This one.

14:40.533 --> 14:41.700
More banner,
less boob.

14:41.733 --> 14:44.567
- Okay.
- Now post it to Twitter.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.867
God help us.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.800
Word on the street--

15:02.833 --> 15:04.900
Bjornberg's
signing with Knopf.

15:04.933 --> 15:06.833
His agent wouldn't even
let him take the meeting.

15:06.867 --> 15:08.567
Well, then you have to
find a way to meet him.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.067
What do you mean?
Like, stalk the guy?

15:10.100 --> 15:11.967
No, I mean don't let
someone else's rules

15:12.000 --> 15:14.600
get in the way of working with a
writer you're passionate about.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.800
You are wise.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.300
I'm on Twitter
and nothing is twittering.

15:21.133 --> 15:23.833
You forgot the hashtag.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.500
Right.
Hashtag.

15:30.867 --> 15:32.267
Liza, get in here.

15:35.467 --> 15:39.167
Look at this,
look at this.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.300
ShowUsYourOates
is trending.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.233
Joyce Carol Oates fans
from around the world

15:43.267 --> 15:45.400
are freeing the nipple
in solidarity.

15:45.433 --> 15:46.967
And maybe, just maybe,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
they will even buy
one of her books.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.300
Oh, my God.

15:54.467 --> 15:55.900
I don't believe this.

15:55.933 --> 15:57.600
I know.
We've gone global.

15:57.633 --> 16:00.400
Excuse me. I have
a small Twitter emergency.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.200
Oh, my God.

16:28.233 --> 16:30.300
You are turning
back into a pumpkin.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.700
Really? Way to make a girl
feel good before a blind date.

16:32.733 --> 16:33.800
No, I'm kidding.

16:33.833 --> 16:34.967
You look pretty.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.533
Very ladylike.

16:36.567 --> 16:37.833
Ladylike.

16:37.867 --> 16:38.867
I'm not sure
that's a compliment.

16:38.900 --> 16:39.867
Oh, 100%.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.300
I like ladies.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.867
It does feel nice to be
wearing my own clothes.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.500
Some of those hipster
thrift store finds

16:44.533 --> 16:45.567
smell like weed.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.200
Well, God's in the details.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.400
Anyway, it's great
to see the old Liza back.

16:49.433 --> 16:51.167
Well, this old girl
is about to go on a date

16:51.200 --> 16:52.967
with an
appropriate-aged fellow

16:53.000 --> 16:55.367
whose references I might
actually comprehend.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.000
Hmm, where's
he taking you?

16:57.033 --> 16:59.733
Roberto's, this really nice
Italian place in Paramus.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.067
Oh.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.200
All right, don't
give me that look.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.433
I'm excited about this.

17:03.467 --> 17:04.967
No, no, no,
I'm excited for you.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.867
Are you?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.367
Honey, you're my friend.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.733
I want what you want.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.067
Crazy thing is,
my life just got interesting

17:12.099 --> 17:13.733
and I can't even
talk about it.

17:23.267 --> 17:25.733
Nobody thought that
healthy food and Mexican food

17:25.767 --> 17:26.967
could go together,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.700
but I was a believer
from the beginning.

17:28.733 --> 17:29.800
and let me tell you,

17:29.833 --> 17:32.067
Chipotle has been
very good to me.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.433
That's wonderful.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.933
Mm, and my ex-wife.

17:35.967 --> 17:40.567
She still participates
in the upside, believe me.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.033
Mm...

17:42.067 --> 17:43.567
how was your fish?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.367
It was very good.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.433
Mm.

17:46.467 --> 17:47.800
It's hard for
me to eat out

17:47.833 --> 17:49.733
with everything I know
about the food business.

17:49.767 --> 17:51.800
Sometimes too much
information's not a good thing.

17:51.833 --> 17:54.800
You know, when Michelle
told me that you were 40,

17:54.833 --> 17:57.300
I thought, "Whoa.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.067
"If I wanted to be with
a 40-year-old woman,

17:59.100 --> 18:00.533
I would have
stayed married."

18:02.500 --> 18:04.167
Sorry, that's a very--
that's a bad joke.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.300
You're very cute.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.267
Thank you.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.967
Now you ask me
a question.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.967
Excuse me?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.200
Go ahead.
Ask anything.

18:12.233 --> 18:14.967
I know these blind dates
can be awkward.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
How long have you
been divorced?

18:17.033 --> 18:18.600
Two years since
it's been final,

18:18.633 --> 18:20.600
but it hadn't been
good for years.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.767
Honestly, we stuck
it out for the kids,

18:22.800 --> 18:25.667
who couldn't
have cared less.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.533
What about you?

18:27.567 --> 18:29.433
It really hasn't
been that long.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.133
We've been separated
about a year.

18:31.167 --> 18:33.633
We actually haven't signed
the divorce papers yet,

18:33.667 --> 18:35.300
because we can't
afford the lawyers.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.133
We're actually too broke
to get divorced.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.633
How's that for comedy?

18:38.667 --> 18:40.500
Or tragedy.
Take your pick.

18:40.533 --> 18:44.700
I'm sorry, there's just this
one email I have to respond to.

18:44.733 --> 18:46.367
No problem.

18:49.633 --> 18:50.967
[phone chimes]

19:00.000 --> 19:01.200
Can I get anybody dessert?

19:01.233 --> 19:03.100
- Oh, I'm done.
- Yeah, me too.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.500
Hey, nut.

19:22.533 --> 19:23.933
You looking for someone?

19:30.900 --> 19:32.500
Sorry.

19:32.533 --> 19:35.100
I just really
needed to do that.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.600
Okay.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.033
I'll see you
around the burgh.

19:39.067 --> 19:41.167
Wait, that's it?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.933
For now.

19:43.305 --> 19:49.353
