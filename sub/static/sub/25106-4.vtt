have transformed themselves

08:58.997 --> 09:00.331
to play against type...

09:01.041 --> 09:02.625
Charlize Theron in <i>Monster,</i>

09:02.709 --> 09:04.294
Jeremy Renner

09:04.377 --> 09:06.880
struggling to be a physicist in <i>Arrival,</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:09.883
Tom Hanks shooting Nazis

09:09.966 --> 09:12.677
instead of celebrating them
and collecting their memorabilia.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.846
I do belong alongside those great actors,

09:14.929 --> 09:16.264
both in people's memories

09:16.347 --> 09:18.725
and as the only black person
on a future <i>Vanity Fair </i> cover.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.061
But how will I learn to dweeb?

09:21.144 --> 09:22.729
[man] Guys, look! I'm doing it!

09:22.812 --> 09:24.814
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! [yelps]

09:29.277 --> 09:31.154
Wow, you're heavier than my birds.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.864
You okay?

09:32.947 --> 09:34.699
[quirky music playing]

09:36.326 --> 09:37.410
Huh!

09:37.952 --> 09:40.497
The guys here are useless.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.709
I tried all my strongest moves:
zipper inspector,

09:44.793 --> 09:46.419
pretending to be a chair.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.671
You can't even get them to look up

09:48.755 --> 09:51.299
from their gizmos and their bleep-blorps.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.552
And what exactly have you been up to,

09:54.636 --> 09:56.513
you busted skank?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.389
Ah, is it that obvious?

09:59.057 --> 10:02.769
His name is Danford,
and he smells like a woodpile.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.688
Isn't it classy how his first name
sounds like a last name?

10:05.772 --> 10:09.484
That means our kids could be named
stuff like Jackson or SquarePants.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.735
What'd I tell you?

10:10.819 --> 10:13.863
Pete Rose belongs in
the hall of fame of rockin' bods.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.158
No, about this trip being
exactly what you needed.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.411
I haven't thought
about the movie in hours!

10:20.495 --> 10:22.330
Aw, good for you, Red.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.958
I'm headed to the bar.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.167
With my luck today,

10:26.251 --> 10:28.962
I bet the door won't
even hit me in the ass.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.383
- Hmm.
- "Hmm." Nerm, nerm, nerm.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.425
Droingle.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.638
Um...

10:40.056 --> 10:41.224
[man] Oh, um...

10:41.307 --> 10:42.517
what are you doing, man?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.519
Being a method actor,
like Daniel Day-Lewis

10:44.602 --> 10:46.146
or the Trivago guy.

10:46.229 --> 10:49.274
When you watch him,
you believe he doesn't sleep in a home.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.526
I'm studying you for a role.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.111
Now,

10:53.194 --> 10:54.737
tell me <i>everything.</i>

10:55.196 --> 10:57.615
How did your nerd father even get
your nerd mother pregnant?

10:58.700 --> 11:00.910
Uh, did she follow him too closely
down a water slide?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.412
- What?
- Ooh.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.038
Where are you from?

11:04.122 --> 11:05.999
Were you a child at one point?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.668
- Yeah. I...
- That's good.

11:08.751 --> 11:13.006
...I grew up in a small town in the South
but never felt like I belonged there.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.841
That's why I came to New York.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.843
[laughs]

11:16.926 --> 11:18.511
You're confused.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.889
You're talking about Titus.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.099
He is very interesting,

11:23.182 --> 11:25.143
but I actually wanna talk about you.
[laughs]

11:25.226 --> 11:28.479
Well, I live in New York.
I have a roommate.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.356
I like Broadway musicals and pizza.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.774
[woodwind music playing]

11:31.858 --> 11:32.984
Can you sit and talk?

11:33.067 --> 11:35.361
Well, I can talk, but...

11:35.862 --> 11:37.363
my hemorrhoids are pretty bad.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.201
You... me...

- Grandmas are lame.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.795
- [quietly] Sorry, Grandma.
- Hi.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.756
This is boring. Let's ditch.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.341
But ditchers get stitchers.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.718
This conference is about disrupting,
right?

11:58.801 --> 11:59.719
So let's, like...

12:00.345 --> 12:02.347
bust the paradigm or whatever.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.766
They do say busting makes you feel good.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.517
But where are we gonna bust?

12:06.601 --> 12:07.685
[rhythmic scratching]

12:07.769 --> 12:09.187
- [dance music playing]
- [Kimmy] Oh,

12:09.270 --> 12:11.272
"bust the paradigm" means "bust a move."

12:11.356 --> 12:12.607
"The paradigm" means "a move."

12:12.690 --> 12:15.735
No one ever comes
to the parties at these things.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.654
It's like having your own
private dance floor.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.031
That's great, 'cause I'm a private dancer.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.617
"A dancer for money.
I do what you want me to do."

12:23.242 --> 12:24.702
What's that song about?

12:24.786 --> 12:27.455
[electronic music playing]

12:30.333 --> 12:31.459
You got moves, Kimmy.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.544
Oh, I just dance like no one's watching,

12:33.628 --> 12:35.421
even though I have
a neighbor who always is.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.098

You're married to DJ Slizzard.

- Wait. No, it's not-- I can--
- You're married?

13:14.085 --> 13:15.962
It sounds worse than it is.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.423
Actually, no.
It's way worse than it sounds.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.383
Never mind!

13:20.466 --> 13:21.551
Thanks a lot, DJ.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.053

So wait.

Jacqueline!

13:45.366 --> 13:48.119
It turns out, nerds are people. [chuckles]

13:48.202 --> 13:50.371
They have feelings <i>and </i> emotions.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.750
If I tickle them, do they not laugh?
If I shove them, do they not fall?

13:57.128 --> 13:59.380
How could I have been so cruel to them?

So, so gay.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.266
I hate how it announces itself
with a flourish

14:10.350 --> 14:11.934
and then leaves you wanting more.

[boy] You're the king.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.279
[sobs]

14:23.363 --> 14:25.990
It's because I was scared
of being different.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.118
It was easier to call out
someone else's differences

14:29.202 --> 14:30.411
than confront my own...

14:31.496 --> 14:32.747
because...

14:32.830 --> 14:34.165

14:34.248 --> 14:35.625

That's how you end every phone call.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.756
And don't feel bad.

is something a lot of children do.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.871
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised.

15:13.955 --> 15:14.872

15:14.956 --> 15:17.542
I don't see a lot of attendees
who really "get" L.A.I.D.

Tell me about it.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.461
Oh, man, I would love to.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.172
Fundamentally, it's all about P2P.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.757
I don't know how much
you know about that--

15:24.841 --> 15:27.468
P-to-P? Kids' stuff.

15:27.552 --> 15:31.472
I started doing that in my parents' garage
back in the '70s.

I'm my own twin brother?

17:22.415 --> 17:24.669
Of course she does.
She's hooked up with both of us.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.041
Think.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.043
Is that really gonna do anyone any good?

18:06.127 --> 18:08.170
Right now, that woman--
I want to say her name

18:08.254 --> 18:09.380
is...

18:09.463 --> 18:10.673
Gorb? That can't be right.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.799
Right now,

18:11.882 --> 18:13.050
she is perfectly happy.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.635
[whispering] And so is my wife.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.429
She and I just bought a house together,

18:16.512 --> 18:17.972
right next door to her parents.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.224
We are decorating a nursery,

18:20.308 --> 18:21.475
and we have a dog.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.436
That's a very cute dog!

18:23.519 --> 18:25.062
No one is getting hurt.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.148
But if you say something,

18:27.231 --> 18:28.274
all those people...

18:29.358 --> 18:31.110
and dogs...

18:31.193 --> 18:32.737
will be devastated.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.823
- So how are your art classes going?
- What?

18:35.906 --> 18:38.784
'Cause you've painted me into a corner.
[inhales sharply]

18:44.707 --> 18:46.876
[Titus] I'm glad I said no to club drugs.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.461
The only K-hole I wanna go down

18:48.544 --> 18:50.838
is a kiss-hole with Popularia.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.174
Like she'd ever kiss you, Nerdler.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.467
[Titus grunts]

18:54.550 --> 18:56.385
- [laughter]
- Yo, that's you, Garrett.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.805
- [laughter]
- [girls] Garrett!

19:01.682 --> 19:04.060
[laughing]

19:04.143 --> 19:04.977
[Titus chuckles]

19:05.061 --> 19:07.104
Alan, could I get a moment?

19:07.188 --> 19:09.982
I'm really loving this show
and the cast and crew, of course.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.444
We've really become a family.
This award is for all of us.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.031
I was just wondering if we might
do a little tweaking.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.950
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm here 'cause I got arrested for meth.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.702
No, I mean the script.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.663
I'm an expert on nerds now.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.123
These kids don't really see themselves
in this character.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.917
They're real people.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.753
If you cut them-- and I did--
they bleed-- a lot.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.713
Okay, I was warned you might be trouble.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.548
Listen, we've only got 15 minutes

19:34.632 --> 19:36.425
to touch on abstinence, drugs,

19:36.509 --> 19:37.760
and not joining ISIS.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.095
Nerds are nerds,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.055
jocks are jocks, end of discussion.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.640
- Now get back out there.
- No--

19:42.723 --> 19:44.600
We're almost at the part
where Nerdler pees his pants

19:44.684 --> 19:46.102
and it gets on the calculator
in his pocket

19:46.185 --> 19:47.853
and it electrocutes his wiener.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.939
- [sighs]
- Come. Go, go.

19:50.773 --> 19:54.610
Recently, my girlfriend's been talking
about possibly showing me her vagina,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.404
and I'm seriously thinking about looking.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.906
Nerm, okay, cool, Jocko.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.533
- That's my client.
- [Titus] Nyerm.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.910
[whispering] Why are you here?
This is for students.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.578
Hmm.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.581
[dance music playing faintly]

20:11.711 --> 20:13.462
I'm here for the group thing.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.881
- Lillian, right?
- Mm-hmm.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.466
- Follow me.
- [Fred] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

20:17.550 --> 20:20.052
<i>get excited for Lillian Kaushtupper.</i>

20:20.136 --> 20:22.179
<i>Here she comes. </i> [clapping]

20:22.263 --> 20:24.140
[scattered applause]

20:25.224 --> 20:27.268
Oh! For the love of Pete.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.019
This is all about...

20:29.103 --> 20:32.606
bleep-bloops and zeep-zorps?

20:32.690 --> 20:35.359
From her parents' garage,
with just a dream and a soldering iron...

20:35.443 --> 20:37.153
Uh, I did not tell you that part.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.613
...to leading the way in L.A.I.D.,

20:39.697 --> 20:41.782
Lillian has been disrupting the paradigm

20:41.866 --> 20:43.075
for decades.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.661
You know, in a world of in-no-vation,

20:45.745 --> 20:48.748
she is all about in-<i>yes</i>- vation.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.750
Okay, stop it. Stop all of this!

20:51.333 --> 20:54.420
I have been asked to share my experience,
so listen up.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.505
I don't get it.
I mean, how can you come here

20:56.589 --> 21:00.092
in your sexual primes,
with your functioning backs,

21:00.176 --> 21:04.221
and spend all day talking about computers?

21:04.305 --> 21:08.017
- [inspirational music playing]
- You're not even making eye contact,

21:08.100 --> 21:10.311
to say nothing of the other parts!

21:10.394 --> 21:13.647
You nerds, you-- you may be
socially awkward, but...

21:13.731 --> 21:14.982
you're human!

21:15.065 --> 21:16.525
[blubbering]

21:16.609 --> 21:17.443
Ow!

21:17.526 --> 21:19.320
My virgin wiener!

21:19.403 --> 21:21.864
[laughter]

21:21.947 --> 21:24.492
[laughter continues]

21:24.575 --> 21:26.410
No. Stop.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.453
Stop all of this!

21:28.871 --> 21:31.749
You nerds may be socially awkward,

21:31.832 --> 21:32.792
but you're human.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.587
There goes my $20 commission.
I was gonna be able to take a cab home.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.340
You all-- you talk about disrupting,

21:39.423 --> 21:42.009
but you just sit here doing nothing!

21:42.092 --> 21:44.595
You're in Pittsburgh,

21:44.678 --> 21:48.474
the city that put French fries
in a sandwich,

21:48.557 --> 21:51.435
so don't tell me
you don't have a free hand.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.854
And look around you for once.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.106
You are surrounded

21:56.190 --> 21:58.526
by your own kind!

21:58.609 --> 22:00.611
Oh, this place should be like...

22:01.111 --> 22:03.030
the Olympic Village or...

22:03.113 --> 22:07.827
the munchkin tent
during the filming of <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

22:08.786 --> 22:10.704
Ooh! Look at that guy. Yeah.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.331
- He gets it.
- [crowd gasps]

22:14.041 --> 22:16.168
I'm a nerd. Fine.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.921
But that doesn't mean I'm not also a jock.

22:23.384 --> 22:24.677
[students cheering]

22:24.760 --> 22:27.054
Ooh! Nice, bro.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.348
And guess what.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.432
I'm also gay.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.976
Like this kid.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.185
[crowd gasps]

22:34.353 --> 22:35.396
That's right.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.106
I'm gay, and I'm pro--

22:37.189 --> 22:38.232
Okay, thank you, Mood.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.984
But my point is,

22:40.067 --> 22:42.152
you can be many things all at once.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.823
You can be a nerd, a jock,
and maybe you're also cursed with

22:45.906 --> 22:49.243
<i>♪ Perfect pitch ♪</i>

22:49.326 --> 22:52.037
- [Titus continues singing]
- [cheers and applause]

22:56.333 --> 22:57.543
You dummies...

22:58.377 --> 22:59.378
like machines.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.463
Let me tell you about three...

23:02.006 --> 23:03.799
beautiful machines.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.842
One:

23:05.509 --> 23:07.011
the human mouth.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.221
Two:

23:09.305 --> 23:10.931
the human hands.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.767
Three: the human lower half.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.769
Three great

23:15.853 --> 23:18.772
feats of engineering.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.566
And guess what.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.277
They are all on one body:

23:23.360 --> 23:24.778
yours!

23:24.862 --> 23:27.865
[cheers and applause]

23:28.407 --> 23:29.783
No!

23:31.994 --> 23:33.495
Don't go with that guy!

23:37.791 --> 23:38.751
Because...

23:38.834 --> 23:40.085
because...

23:42.796 --> 23:44.840
he has your grandma's interface!

23:44.923 --> 23:46.300
[crowd gasps]

23:46.383 --> 23:48.135
He has a Hotmail account!

23:48.218 --> 23:49.345
- [crowd groans]
- Hotmail?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.096
And he told me to call him,

23:51.180 --> 23:53.349
like this is 1998 or something.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.683
Oh, and, Danford...

23:54.767 --> 23:57.728
what exactly does "disruption" mean?

23:58.520 --> 23:59.355
[Danford coughs]

23:59.438 --> 24:01.065
Well, uh, there's the-- the paradigm,

24:01.148 --> 24:02.441
um, of course.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.693
And you don't want it to be...

24:05.778 --> 24:06.987
'rupted. I don't know!

24:07.071 --> 24:08.364
You stupid nerds.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.158
And I don't care.
I wanted to be in sports management.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.618
Kill him.

24:12.701 --> 24:16.538
[dramatic music playing]

24:16.622 --> 24:18.123
- [crowd cheering]
- [man] Let's do this!

24:18.207 --> 24:20.334
- [man 2] It's happening!
- [woman] Yeah, it is.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.629
- Oh!
- Oh, uh, run, Kimmy!

24:25.047 --> 24:26.715
[excited chatter]

24:26.799 --> 24:28.342
Titus.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.927
That's it. I'm done.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.428
You've burned too many bridges.

24:31.512 --> 24:32.471
Not true.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.015
I put out a bridge fire
when I flooded that Macy's.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.517
Excuse me.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.894
I'm the principal here
at Daniel Patrick Moynihan

24:38.977 --> 24:41.105
Pubic School. The L fell off the sign.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.731
But why do you have to say it that way?

24:42.815 --> 24:46.068
I just wanted to thank you.
I've never seen our students so engaged

24:46.151 --> 24:47.403
and excited.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.113
Also, I won a bet about Jason being gay.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.364
[mouthing words]

24:50.447 --> 24:53.075
This is a shot in the dark,
but we're looking for someone

24:53.158 --> 24:54.952
to direct our spring play.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.870
Our theater teacher recently left

24:56.954 --> 24:58.330
to pursue other opportunities.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.581
He got some girls pregnant?

24:59.665 --> 25:00.874
Super pregnant, yes.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.627
Is there any chance you'd be interested?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.003
Me? [laughs]

25:05.087 --> 25:06.505
Teach children?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.257
You are looking for work, Titus,

25:08.340 --> 25:09.758
and I need this commission.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.302
I just lost 20 bucks to this guy
over that gay kid.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.346
And the students clearly worship you.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.724
What? Like a god?

25:16.807 --> 25:18.016
Well, not exactly like--

25:18.100 --> 25:20.060
Sold! To the handsome bald gentleman

25:20.144 --> 25:21.395
who's talking right now.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.689
My agent will handle all the details.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.150
You want Titus?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.360
Well, I'm gonna make you wish
you'd never been born.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.403
Let's talk salary.

25:29.486 --> 25:30.988
It's $140 a day.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.948
Drive me home, and we have a deal.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.200
[breathlessly] Oh, God.

25:35.284 --> 25:38.537
That was the fastest orgy
I've ever been in.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.289
Oy! Ready to get out of here?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.875
- Oh, I'm ready to do a lot of stuff.
- Yeah?

25:42.958 --> 25:45.085
Most people come to Pittsburgh to escape,

25:45.169 --> 25:47.296
but I just can't stop being me, Lillian.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.339
If there's a jerk, I'm gonna bust him!

25:49.423 --> 25:52.134
And I know you said there's nothing
I can do about that dumb movie,

25:52.217 --> 25:53.594
but I have to try.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.472
You know what?
I shouldn't have tried to stop you.

25:56.555 --> 26:00.517
Bustin' jerks is just your
Asses and Glasses Fest.

26:00.601 --> 26:03.395
Ah, by the way,
I named what I just did here

26:03.479 --> 26:05.606
Asses and Glasses Fest.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.732
Okay.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.734
And I wanna make sure everyone knows

26:08.817 --> 26:11.028
that the Reverend is a real monster,

26:11.111 --> 26:12.154
not a party monster.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.072
Well, everyone's a lot of people, dear.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.824
Well, so am I.

[Lillian chuckles]

26:16.992 --> 26:18.160
[growls]

26:19.036 --> 26:21.038
Will I ever see you again, Lillian?

26:21.121 --> 26:23.165
No.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.334
But we'll always have Pittsburgh.
