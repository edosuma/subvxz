00:06.807 --> 00:08.642
(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.676 --> 00:12.346
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.748
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.782 --> 00:16.650
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.684 --> 00:18.286
are members
of an elite squad

00:18.319 --> 00:20.321
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.423
These are their stories.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.459
I think I'm gonna
throw up.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.229
Chloe, calm down.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.763
Your heel
just caught the hem,

00:29.797 --> 00:31.299
it'll be fine.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.168
He's gonna be here
any second.

00:34.202 --> 00:37.805
Everyone panics over
their first dance, sweetie.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.241
Here.
Wipe your face.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.609
Don't touch
your dress.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.610
A mascara stain
would ruin it.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.611
[phone ringing]

00:43.644 --> 00:44.412
Oh, my God,
it's him.

00:44.445 --> 00:48.082
Get it!
Let the machine
pick up.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.084
Mom!
I mean it.
Don't move.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.086
(phone machine greeting)
Hi, you've reached
the Sellers residence.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.554
Tell us something good.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.390
(demonic male voice)
Your daughter is such
a hot piece of ass.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.359
Best sex I ever had.

00:58.392 --> 01:02.163
She's a screamer,
did you know that?

01:02.196 --> 01:04.365
Made me crazy.

01:04.398 --> 01:09.103
Especially when she screamed
"Mommy" while I--

01:09.137 --> 01:10.171
Pervert!

01:11.439 --> 01:12.606
Who is that?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.275
How should I know?
It was a prank call.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.211
If that's one of your little
friend's idea of a joke--

01:17.245 --> 01:18.679
Maybe it's one of Kaley's
lame friends.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.414
Where is your sister?

01:20.448 --> 01:23.251
Ma, it was just
some random loser.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.352
She should have been
home by now.

01:24.385 --> 01:27.355
Why do you have to make
a big deal out of everything?

01:27.388 --> 01:28.422
You need to finish
my dress.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.324
Shh!

01:30.358 --> 01:34.295
Hello?
Kaley?

01:34.328 --> 01:35.563
It's Mom.
Can you hear me?

01:35.596 --> 01:40.368
[muffled cries]

01:40.401 --> 01:42.803
Kaley can't come
to the phone.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.805
Kaley!

01:44.838 --> 01:48.276
She's tied up
right now.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.193
Gimme a status on
the Kaley Sellers abduction.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.494
Talked to everyone
in her address book.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.363
Nobody had plans
with her last night.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.364
Tap's in place
on their phone,

02:43.397 --> 02:45.399
but our chatty rapist
hasn't called back yet.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.500
(Munch)
Well, maybe he can't
get through.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.669
Mrs. Sellers has been calling
here every ten minutes.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.903
Who was the last person
to see her?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.405
Clerk at the Federal
Courthouse.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.474
Kaley works as
a bike messenger

02:53.507 --> 02:55.809
for the illustrious law firm,
Henshall & Langan.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.512
They've got a big
criminal defense division.
Liv's down there now,

02:58.546 --> 03:01.249
trying to sniff out
a non-incarcerated client list.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.317
Kaley's bike's
also M.I.A.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.318
The court documents

03:04.352 --> 03:05.185
were stamped delivered
at 4:52.

03:05.219 --> 03:08.622
She disappeared
between there and home.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.424
That's too much ground
to canvass.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.360
We know any
of her regular spots,

03:12.393 --> 03:13.361
restaurants, shops?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.363
Does she belong
to a gym?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.231
That was Liv.
Turn on the TV.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.502
(Benson)
We should be holding this
press conference, not you.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.771
This isn't about who gets
the most air time.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.473
Do you have any news?

03:25.506 --> 03:26.274
I'm sorry.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.174
There is really
no other option

03:27.207 --> 03:28.041
than to appeal
to the public for help.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.411
I agree with you,
but we need to control

03:30.444 --> 03:32.480
which information
gets released.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.283
And you just told Mrs. Sellers
that you don't have any.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.384
And given the 48 hour
statistic--

03:36.417 --> 03:37.418
Well, what's that?

03:37.451 --> 03:38.586
It's the stat
that he's confusing

03:38.619 --> 03:40.488
on the abduction
of much younger children.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.722
You think he's gonna
kill her?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.424
We don't know that,
Mrs. Sellers.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.593
He's had her for
at least 16 hours,

03:45.626 --> 03:48.429
and you people
haven't done anything.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.563
I wanna do this now.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.731
Right through here.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.705
She's been working
to pay her own tuition.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.740
She plans to go to NYU,
then law school.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.041
(reporters all shouting)

04:01.074 --> 04:03.277
(reporter)
Is the answering machine
tape available?

04:03.311 --> 04:05.446
After conferring
with the D.A.'s office,

04:05.479 --> 04:07.381
we've decided not
to release that at this time.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.983
Does Kaley have a history
of drug or alcohol abuse?

04:10.017 --> 04:13.887
No, she's never even
taken a drink.

04:13.921 --> 04:14.922
Detective?
(reporters all shouting)

04:14.955 --> 04:15.956
I'm Mindy Mayhern.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.325
I'm the office manager here.
I need to talk to you.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.594
(woman reporter)
Has she been in any
abusive relationships?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.062
She hasn't had a boyfriend
since high school.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.532
Mrs. Sellers, do you have
any words to say

04:24.565 --> 04:26.500
to her abductors?
Yes.

04:26.534 --> 04:30.804
I will give you
everything I own.

04:30.838 --> 04:36.477
Please.
Just don't hurt her anymore.

04:36.510 --> 04:41.882
Please.
Let her come home, please.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.885
Kaley Sellers
is a beloved employee here.

04:44.918 --> 04:48.389
She has a bright future,
and we consider her

04:48.422 --> 04:49.523
a member of our family.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.391
Henshall & Langan
is putting up

04:50.424 --> 04:52.092
a $10,000 reward
for any information--

04:52.125 --> 04:53.594
That's all we need.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.595
Leading
to her whereabouts.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.465
Calls can be directed
to the...SVU Tipline.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.799
Here comes
the crapstorm.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.502
at 1-800-789--

05:01.535 --> 05:03.637
No one goes home.
Everybody's on overtime.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.573
There's gonna be a lot
of leads to track down.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.475
And mostly from
the fruitloop brigade.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.344
Captain, it's the Ledger.
What do we tell 'em?

05:10.378 --> 05:13.514
Pain in the ass press.
Put it through to my office.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.483
We just fired one
of our other messengers

05:15.516 --> 05:17.718
because we caught him
making stops at strip clubs.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.487
Do you think
he abducted Kaley?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.588
No, but he's the reason
we started giving

05:20.621 --> 05:21.722
our messengers
cell phones,

05:21.755 --> 05:22.956
and they're all equipped
with GPS chips.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.791
Hold on.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.426
You've know where she is
all this time

05:25.459 --> 05:26.527
and you haven't
told anybody?

05:26.560 --> 05:27.628
No, I didn't know
she was missing

05:27.661 --> 05:28.429
until this morning.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.663
I immediately checked
our tracker,

05:29.697 --> 05:30.931
but her cell phone
wasn't turned on

05:30.964 --> 05:32.966
until a few minutes ago.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.768
So where is she?

05:34.802 --> 05:37.505
According to our
mobile locator, 8th Avenue.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.506
Kaley's cell
is number two.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.574
Not only is it
turned back on.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.309
She's moving.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.547
(Benson on police radio)
Subject is proceeding east
on 44th, between 7th and 8th.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.048
We're right on her tail.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.118
We're on the block.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.654
Halfway down the block,
moving slowly.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.989
She could be in a trunk,
in a back of a van.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.992
Seriously doubt he's got her
sitting right beside him.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.930
Just came to a dead stop.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.443
Sir, we're gonna have
to ask you to empty

06:15.476 --> 06:16.510
the contents
of your vehicle.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.578
From the cab?

06:17.611 --> 06:18.579
(Fin)
No, from the back.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.480
What the hell for?

06:19.513 --> 06:21.649
Guy tossed evidence
from a felony crime.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.683
You picked up
the lucky bin.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.585
Damn, I'm at the end
of my run.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.453
I got--I got a full load
in there.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.622
He may have tossed in
a girl as well.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.759
Hey, I just compress.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.160
If she was alive
when she went in,

06:33.193 --> 06:34.628
she ain't no more.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.699
(Cragen)
They found the cell,
but no trace of Kaley.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.034
Why did he turn it back on
before he tossed it?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.603
Tech thinks garbage
in the truck

06:42.636 --> 06:44.137
pressed against
the "send" button.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.574
Phone automatically dialed
the last number called.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.541
Mrs. Sellers.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.943
Yeah, so our phone tap
recorded 20 minutes

06:49.977 --> 06:50.811
of garbage truck noise.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.780
You know, the trash
in the same bag

06:52.813 --> 06:54.014
might tell us
where he dumped it.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.583
Munch and Fin
are going through it now.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.652
TARU is working on the phone,
but it's pretty mangled.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.454
'Scuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.155
I've seen the girl
you're looking for.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.692
When?
Just before
the press conference.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.093
She was terrified.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.461
A man had her
by the hair.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.463
I didn't get a real
good look at him,

07:09.497 --> 07:10.464
but his eyes were
very distinctive,

07:10.498 --> 07:11.999
one brown, one blue.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.801
Okay, where was this?

07:13.834 --> 07:15.669
I had a vision.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.642
Thank you very much
for coming in.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.745
Look, I know what
you're thinking.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.846
Course you do,
you're psychic.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.516
You believe
I'm mentally ill.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.617
He's good.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.718
Look, I have worked with many

07:30.751 --> 07:33.887
other police departments
on missing persons cases.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.223
Uh, my name is
Sebastian Ballentine.
[phone ringing]

07:36.256 --> 07:37.691
The Sebastian Ballentine?

07:37.725 --> 07:39.192
You've heard of me?
No.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.694
Stabler.
Uh, Officer
Baxter.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.497
Would you please show
Mr. Ballentine out?

07:43.531 --> 07:44.732
This way, sir.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.734
Yeah, okay, uh, look.
Here's my card.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.869
Call if you need me, okay?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.771
That's $3.95 a minute?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.541
That's...very good.
It's-it's a local call.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.908
Lab just called.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.244
TARU found something
on Kaley's cell.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.583
(Morales)
For a cheap phone, it's got
a lot of bells and whistles,

08:02.616 --> 08:03.917
including a camera.

08:03.951 --> 08:04.918
You got a picture?

08:04.952 --> 08:06.520
Poor quality,
low pixel count,

08:06.554 --> 08:07.821
but a picture
nonetheless.

08:07.855 --> 08:08.922
When was it taken?

08:08.956 --> 08:11.759
It's time and date coded.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.161
7:25 a.m.
this morning.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.063
At least we know she lived
through the night.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.131
I also have
two older photos.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.301
Okay, that was last week.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.036
Mrs. Sellers said Kaley
didn't have a boyfriend.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.838
Take a look
at the next shot.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.741
I'd say he's much
more into her

08:27.775 --> 08:28.742
than she is into him.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.811
Who is he?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.713
Jake Ostrander.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.114
Kaley's old
high school boyfriend.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.182
When did they break up?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.117
Last summer.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.652
Were they still friendly?

08:38.686 --> 08:40.754
No.
She hated him.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.856
(Stabler)
Chloe, where's your mom
right now?

08:42.890 --> 08:44.758
She's in Kaley's room.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.193
Doing a...reading.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.096
What kind of reading?

08:49.129 --> 08:52.099
Yes.
I'm sensing her essence now.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.770
She's very sweet.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.238
And she's very
kind hearted.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.341
She's a Gemini,
isn't she?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.276
Yes.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.344
(Stabler)
What are you doing here?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.246
Hello, Elliot.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.182
You know this guy?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.185
Sebastian can see Kaley.
She's alive.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.788
And you're gonna
find her.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.695
What's your angle,
you little vulture?

09:21.729 --> 09:22.663
I'm just trying to help.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.632
That woman is out
of her mind with worry,

09:24.665 --> 09:25.633
she doesn't
need your help!

09:25.666 --> 09:29.302
I keep seeing a serial port
and a computer cord.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.971
Does that mean
anything to you?

09:32.973 --> 09:34.808
Maybe he met her over
the Internet.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.777
Yes, I'm seeing that.
No, you're not.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.046
Computer Crimes went over
Kaley's computer.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.914
There are no
suspicious e-mails.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.750
She never visited
a chatroom,

09:42.783 --> 09:43.817
you pathetic fraud.

09:43.851 --> 09:44.852
What about water?

09:44.885 --> 09:46.620
I see her under
flowing water.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.856
But she's not wet.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.323
Doesn't really make sense,
does it?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.792
[thud]

09:51.825 --> 09:54.294
What?
You didn't see that coming?

09:54.327 --> 09:58.331
No, but I do see
an anger management class

09:58.365 --> 09:59.399
in someone's future.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.135
Hey, you think
this is funny?
No.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.671
A girl's been raped
and kidnapped,

10:03.704 --> 10:04.805
and you're trying
to make a buck

10:04.838 --> 10:06.640
off her mother's misery?

10:08.175 --> 10:11.812
Your temper has gotten you
into trouble, hasn't it?

10:11.845 --> 10:12.946
I'm seeing citations.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.614
Suspensions.

10:16.283 --> 10:21.254
Go home.
And don't come back here.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.127
Believe me, I understand
your skepticism,

10:27.160 --> 10:28.696
but I can help you.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.364
You wanna help?
Stay the hell out of this.

10:34.167 --> 10:39.006
You should call your wife
and kids, they're worried.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.374
Mr. Ballentine hasn't
asked for a cent.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.443
Mrs. Sellers,
I know that you're desperate

10:43.476 --> 10:45.178
to get your
daughter back.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.413
But you need
to understand

10:46.446 --> 10:49.049
that there are unscrupulous
people out there.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.851
That's not Sebastian.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.152
Psychics come out
of the woodwork

10:52.185 --> 10:54.855
in high profile cases
for exposure.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.089
It gets them business.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.391
But--but
he had a vision.
Right.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.227
And so did
the 600 psychics

11:00.260 --> 11:03.063
who called in tips
on the Elizabeth Smart case.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.965
Not to mention
all the callers

11:04.998 --> 11:06.133
who had dreams
about it.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.701
A psychic has never
solved a case.

11:07.735 --> 11:11.905
But he told me things
he couldn't possibly know.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.974
Like Kaley wanted
to go to NYU.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.043
You said that
at the press conference.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.712
A-And he told me
that she had a scar

11:18.746 --> 11:21.114
from a childhood
accident.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.116
And she does,
under her chin.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.052
Almost everybody
has a scar

11:25.085 --> 11:26.920
from an accident
from childhood.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.292
Where's Mr. Ballentine?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.995
You haven't chased him away,
have you?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.029
Mrs. Sellers,
I promise you

11:36.063 --> 11:37.798
that we will
find Kaley sooner

11:37.831 --> 11:41.769
by following
tangible leads.
Like what?

11:41.802 --> 11:44.204
Chloe, show your mother
the picture.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.211
Jake Ostrander?
When was this taken?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.914
A week ago
on Kaley's phone.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.315
Did she mention
seeing him?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.851
No.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.753
Why did they break up?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.488
Because Kaley
wouldn't put out.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.159
Chloe.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.995
Did Kaley tell you that?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.963
No, I read it
in her diary.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.866
We didn't find
a diary.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.002
She tore it up
after she caught me.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.872
Well, what else
did she say about Jake?

12:18.906 --> 12:22.509
Was she scared of him?
No.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.879
She just wasn't
ready to...do it.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.351
Do you think it could
have been Jake's voice

12:31.384 --> 12:32.419
on that answering
machine?

12:32.452 --> 12:38.859
Sebastian asked me
if the letter J meant anything.

12:38.892 --> 12:42.229
He must have meant Jake.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.199
(Fin)
I talked
to Jake Ostrander's father.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.534
He said Jake's away
at college in Boston.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.903
Yeah, but we know that
he came home last weekend.

12:49.937 --> 12:50.871
The Dad confirmed that,

12:50.904 --> 12:53.173
but he said he spent
this weekend in Bean-Town.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.975
I've got calls in
to verify it.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.509
Look at these names.
They can't all be suspects.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.847
The bag the phone was in
tore apart in the truck.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.381
I took names off every
loose piece of mail

13:01.414 --> 13:02.482
and crud coated magazine

13:02.515 --> 13:04.017
trying to nail down
where it came from.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.253
And this is
the garbage route.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.521
And this is where
the patrolmen found her bike.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.957
An hour ago
under an overpass.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.959
Five blocks west
from her cell phone.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.127
Yeah, we're starting
to narrow down the search area.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.231
Now what?

13:19.967 --> 13:21.201
'Scuse me, 'scuse me.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.903
Now, what part of
stay out of this

13:22.936 --> 13:24.004
don't you understand?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.605
Look, I just, uh,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.507
I feel that this is
where I'm meant to be.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.542
Then you are the world's
worst psychic.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.478
The amazing Ballentine
is back.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.080
I was wondering if you'd
collected any evidence

13:33.113 --> 13:34.447
you'd like me to perform
a reading on.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.448
No.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.249
Yes.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.385
Detective Benson,
show him a room.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.954
Okay.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.023
Thank you.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.091
(Stabler)
You're welcome.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.425
Mr. Ballentine.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.526
Look, Captain, Captain.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.261
He's completely
snowed the mother.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.031
I just want him to stop
bothering her and us again.

13:51.064 --> 13:51.965
This isn't
a babysitting service.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.067
So we dump him in a room
and leave him there

13:54.101 --> 13:54.902
until he figures it out.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.104
Tipline has received
over 300 calls.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.371
All our rooms are full.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.608
So we stuff him
in a urinal.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.877
Sister Peg.
What are you doing here?

14:03.911 --> 14:06.046
She saw the report
on Kaley Sellers.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.081
During my regular condom run,
I warned the working girls

14:08.115 --> 14:11.584
that there was a man snatching
young women off the street.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.386
And Bernadette here thinks
she may have run into him.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.988
You're a prostitute.

14:15.022 --> 14:15.855
(Benson)
Mr. Ballentine.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.357
Uh, why don't you have
a seat over here?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.059
Thank you.
It was on a date.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.560
John, my date,
is totally obsessed

14:20.593 --> 14:21.361
with this story.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.130
Has me pretend to be
the missing kid.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.297
Kaley.

14:24.331 --> 14:27.100
Yeah.
He keeps calling me Kaley.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.969
Acts out this whole
abduction fantasy.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.139
He was just a little too
into it, if you catch my drift.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.641
I think it's wonderful
that you two came forward.

14:34.674 --> 14:35.909
And you're a Madam.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.912
No, I'm a nun.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.014
What are you?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.082
I'm a psychic.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.083
(Benson)
Officer Kivlahan.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.184
Would you please find a room

14:44.217 --> 14:47.020
for our visiting clairvoyant
and make him comfortable?

14:47.054 --> 14:48.388
(Sister)
I've got to get back
to St. Anne's.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.090
It's a full house
at the shelter.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.092
Someone can drive
Bernadette home?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.460
(Benson)
Of course.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.929
Guys, Jake Ostrander's roommate
from BC called back.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.064
Say he cut classes
early Friday,

14:57.097 --> 14:58.331
drove home
to meet a girl.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.567
Kaley?
Didn't have a name.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.136
Just knew he was going
to "nail some skirt."

15:03.170 --> 15:06.339
Said he crashed over at his
friend Michael's apartment.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.111
[Stabler pounding]
Michael Winnick.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.080
Open the door.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.415
[latches click]

15:17.117 --> 15:18.218
Mikey's out of town.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.288
Step aside.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.290
It's not Kaley.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.557
Hey, how long has Jake
been here?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.060
Since Friday.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.129
W-W-Why are you looking
for Kaley?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.130
She was abducted
and raped.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.664
Do you know anything
about that?

15:31.698 --> 15:33.066
Just that she was
asking for it.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.401
What the hell
does that mean?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.003
Why don't you
get some clothes on?

15:37.670 --> 15:41.108
Look, all I ever heard was how
she wanted it to be special.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.375
She held out on me

15:42.409 --> 15:44.277
the whole year we were dating.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.478
I never got the prize.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.115
Looks to me like you
never stopped trying.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.551
Can I show you
something?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.520
Yeah.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.555
When I saw her
at the library,

15:55.588 --> 15:58.425
I snuck up on her,
and saw the site she was on.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.195
And what was it?
BiddingRoom.com

16:02.229 --> 16:03.430
She didn't have that
on her home computer.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.166
Probably 'cause
her runt sister was too nosy.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.200
Well, what was she buying?

16:07.234 --> 16:11.504
I think it has to do
with what she was selling.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.440
(Cragen)
Her virginity?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.409
(Munch)
I'm an 18 year old girl
struggling to make tuition.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.211
The high bidder will win
my virginity.

16:18.245 --> 16:21.214
Rare opportunity.
Serious bidders only.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.350
I don't care if she calls it
an auction or a yard sale.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.584
It's prostitution.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.219
Girl was desperate
to get into college.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.155
Maybe she was selling
the only asset she had.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.489
Yeah, who gets to tell
her mother?

16:29.522 --> 16:30.490
Press is gonna have

16:30.523 --> 16:31.491
a field day with this.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.492
We know who won?

16:32.525 --> 16:33.760
Well, it's a 10-day listing.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.528
The bidding
hasn't closed yet.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.164
Bids are up to $8,000.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.398
Are the bidders listed?

16:40.767 --> 16:43.436
(Fin)
Yeah, all 500 of them.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.139
A lot are from the same guy
who keeps getting outbid.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.574
(Cragen)
ConEsewer.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.242
(Munch)
That's his
BiddingRoom name,

16:49.276 --> 16:50.777
but if I click
"member profile,"

16:50.810 --> 16:52.245
I can read feedback
from people he's bought from.

16:52.279 --> 16:55.048
They had to send
their item to him.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.250
They would know
his name and address.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.088
(Fin)
So tell us, Harlan.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.756
Why'd you pick
the screen name ConEsewer?

17:03.790 --> 17:06.459
It's a play on words.
Connoisseur?

17:06.493 --> 17:07.727
Yeah, I got it,
dork boy.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.429
Yeah, your taste
is impeccable.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.797
You buy all this crap
on BiddingRoom?

17:10.830 --> 17:13.266
Each and every
piece in here

17:13.300 --> 17:14.701
is a certified
rare collectible.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.104
Yeah, I can't believe they
stopped making these babies.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.105
You don't do that well
with the ladies,

17:18.138 --> 17:20.140
do you, Harlan?

17:20.173 --> 17:21.141
I do all right.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.309
Yeah, when you
pay for it.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.211
A girl's virginity would be
the ultimate collectible,

17:24.244 --> 17:25.212
wouldn't it?

17:25.245 --> 17:26.413
In mint condition, yes.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.449
Bet you're the type who has
to win every auction you're in.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.118
You've got an expensive
habit here, pal.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.253
How were you gonna pay
for the virgin?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.354
I was gonna sell off
my Hummels.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.155
She was way past
your price range,

17:35.188 --> 17:37.424
but you just had
to have her anyway,

17:37.457 --> 17:38.458
didn't you?

17:38.491 --> 17:41.761
They found Kaley
in Hell's Kitchen.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.630
Super went to check on
the water heater

17:43.663 --> 17:44.764
first thing
this morning.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.366
He might have
tainted the scene.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.334
Put a greasy
blanket on her.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.436
How many ways
to get down there?
Just one.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.171
You have to come down
the front stoop,

17:51.204 --> 17:52.639
enter the exterior
basement door.

17:52.672 --> 17:56.209
(Benson)
Door's been jimmied.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.294
Ligature strangulation.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.094
Rigor hasn't even
set in yet.

18:15.128 --> 18:18.165
She's only been dead
a couple hours.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.468
[toilet flushes]

18:21.501 --> 18:24.804
No, no.
What?

18:24.837 --> 18:25.805
That water pipe.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.242
What about it?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.210
Sebastian described this.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.412
He said she'd be found
under flowing water,

18:32.445 --> 18:35.715
but she wouldn't be wet.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.254
Where is he?
Who?

18:41.288 --> 18:42.255
Kivlahan.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.323
(Kivlahan)
Detective?

18:43.356 --> 18:44.324
That psychic nutcase
from last night.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.325
Where did you put him?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.160
Interview room.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.528
That was like
eight hours ago.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.829
He's been there
all night.

18:49.862 --> 18:50.830
(Munch)
So not a single living soul

18:50.863 --> 18:51.831
can vouch for your whereabouts

18:51.864 --> 18:53.766
between Friday at 5:00 p.m.
and Sunday morning?

18:53.800 --> 18:54.767
Damn it.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.736
(Cragen)
What's the problem?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.638
Where'd they move
Ballentine to?

18:58.671 --> 18:59.806
I haven't seen him, why?

19:01.508 --> 19:02.609
I let that girl die.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.676
Elliot.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.477
She was still alive.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.945
We had him before
he killed her.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.514
Who?
Ballentine.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.915
It's Ballentine.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.217
I don't know how,
I don't know why,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.852
but he did it.

19:12.885 --> 19:13.853
He gave you
a business card.

19:13.886 --> 19:14.854
Do you still have it?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.890
I tossed it
on your desk.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.861
That Sebastian guy.

19:21.894 --> 19:22.862
I thought he was
the real deal.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.597
Kivlahan, I'm in no mood
for jokes.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.866
No, he knew my mother's name,
and that she had passed,

19:26.899 --> 19:28.468
and that she didn't
get along with my wife.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.470
If you fell for that guy's
load of bull,

19:30.503 --> 19:33.506
you're in the wrong
line of work, pal.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.608
Where the hell is it?

19:35.642 --> 19:37.944
(Sebastian)
Try looking under
your mouse pad.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.914
You're still here.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.283
Of course.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.417
I feel like a bad piece
of furniture.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.919
No matter where they move me,
I seem to be in the way.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.955
You saying you've
been here all night?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.723
You asked me to wait for you,
didn't you?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.593
You never left
this building?

19:53.626 --> 19:56.529
Does astral
projection count?

19:56.563 --> 19:59.499
You knew that a computer
would be involved.

19:59.532 --> 20:03.470
You knew she'd be found
under flowing water.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.572
How'd you know that,
huh?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.007
I have a gift.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.843
Sometimes it's
more of a curse.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.714
(man on tape)
Your daughter is such
a hot piece of ass.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.317
Best sex I ever had.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.918
(Stabler)
That's you.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.687
Doesn't sound
anything like me.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.923
A crime lab is running that
through a filter

20:23.956 --> 20:26.393
and an audio scrubber.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.928
They will get a voice I.D.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.898
Great.
Ask 'em to put a rush on it.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.866
You feeling cooperative?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.702
Let me hook you up
to a lie detector.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.970
That'd be fantastic.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.472
And if it said
I was telling the truth

20:39.506 --> 20:40.940
about being a psychic,
would you believe me then?

20:43.643 --> 20:46.746
Okay, psychic.
All right.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.281
What am I thinking?

20:48.315 --> 20:49.482
What do you
want to know?

20:49.516 --> 20:52.018
You're the psychic.
What am I thinking?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.890
Ne-Negative energy
blocks the channel.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.927
I'm completely open.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.302
I'm sensing trouble
with a family member.

21:09.336 --> 21:13.039
A woman.
Is it your wife?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.908
I don't discuss
my family at work.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.649
I see the number three.

21:22.682 --> 21:23.950
Pregnancies?

21:25.985 --> 21:31.924
Oh, yes.
It's family again, sorry.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.626
How the hell
is he doing that?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.328
(Cragen)
Elliot has four kids.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.029
Three pregnancies.
One was twins.

21:37.063 --> 21:37.864
He's using a technique

21:37.897 --> 21:39.599
that psychics have used
for centuries,

21:39.632 --> 21:42.402
cold reading.
And what's that?

21:42.435 --> 21:43.936
It's basically
intuition

21:43.970 --> 21:44.871
and common sense.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.873
He starts with a very
general statement

21:46.906 --> 21:48.775
and then he looks
for a reaction,

21:48.808 --> 21:51.344
a nod of the head,
an aha.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.979
We give away volumes
with our faces.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.382
Elliot tensed up the second
he mentioned family.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.783
That was a "tell."

21:56.816 --> 21:58.451
And then Sebastian
followed up on that,

21:58.485 --> 21:59.686
and he guessed the wife.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.887
It's the most obvious.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.988
Had he guessed
the wrong person,

22:02.021 --> 22:03.856
he would have noticed
a lowering of the eyebrows,

22:03.890 --> 22:04.857
a tilt to the head--

22:04.891 --> 22:05.992
Signs of doubt.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.594
And then he would have
quickly switched to,

22:07.627 --> 22:09.429
"Oh, I'm wrong,
it's a child.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.530
It's definitely
a child."

22:10.563 --> 22:12.499
People forget all
the wrong guesses,

22:12.532 --> 22:14.033
remember the one
right answer.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.768
But he did
tell Mrs. Sellers

22:15.802 --> 22:17.370
that Kaley was involved
with somebody

22:17.404 --> 22:19.071
beginning with
the letter J, Jake.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.941
Because they always start
with their best odds,

22:21.974 --> 22:23.710
the letter J or M.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.513
Two most common first names
are John and Mary.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.914
You want
to expose him?

22:27.947 --> 22:31.083
Then don't contribute
to the conversation at all.

22:31.117 --> 22:34.887
Or better yet, telegraph him
false feedback.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.724
See how psychic
he is then.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.028
I'm seeing a rift.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.634
I'm sensing someone
has caused you a lot of pain.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.973
It's a man.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.476
It's...someone very
important in your life,

22:56.509 --> 23:00.112
but...

23:00.146 --> 23:03.416
I don't see that he's really
been there for you.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.886
Well, he's been
busy at work.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.491
I'm sorry, but I...

23:11.524 --> 23:13.826
see him with other women.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.095
Oh, my God.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.132
How do you know that?

23:21.468 --> 23:23.803
It's your father,
isn't it?

23:25.572 --> 23:29.141
No, it's not
my father.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.444
Ah.

23:32.679 --> 23:35.114
Well, there is a-a problem

23:35.147 --> 23:37.149
with your husband.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.086
What about him?

23:40.119 --> 23:43.790
You don't have one.

23:52.865 --> 23:56.068
Well, that experiment
failed miserably.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.170
I lifted Ballentine's prints
off the coffee cup

23:58.204 --> 24:00.640
like you asked me,
ran him through A-FIS.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.908
He's not in the system.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.743
Am I crazy, or is this guy
actually psychic?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.111
(Huang)
No, he's been
trained in FACS.

24:05.144 --> 24:08.147
Facial Action
Coding System.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.050
What, he's gone
to psychic university?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.685
Transferred
from Klown Kollege?

24:12.719 --> 24:16.188
There are 43 distinct
facial movements.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.690
A psychologist
named Paul Ekman

24:17.724 --> 24:20.092
catalogued 3,000
possible combinations

24:20.126 --> 24:22.028
making up the entire spectrum
of human emotion.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.029
(Cragen)
Why?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.163
To see if someone's lying.

24:24.196 --> 24:28.200
FACS breaks facial movement
down into action units.

24:28.234 --> 24:32.705
AU-1 is raising
the frontalis par medialis.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.106
That's not even English.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.809
It's the inner eyebrow.
It's a sign of distress.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.111
I didn't think
I gave anything away.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.246
FACS teaches you
how to pick up

24:40.279 --> 24:41.748
on fleeting microexpressions

24:41.781 --> 24:43.149
that most people
don't even see.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.918
Turns you into
a human lie detector.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.987
It's being taught
at the FBI and CIA.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.288
So how'd this numb-nuts
learn it?

24:49.321 --> 24:52.825
The CD-Rom is sold
over the Internet.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.928
I deserve an apology.
In writing.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.530
You'll be receiving one
in the mail

24:57.564 --> 24:59.165
in six to eight weeks.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.270
(Carlene)
Can somebody help me?

25:04.303 --> 25:05.271
You all right, Ma'am?

25:05.304 --> 25:08.040
No, my husband's been here
since last night.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.276
He called at 2:00 a.m.
and said he'd be home soon,

25:10.309 --> 25:11.611
but we're still waiting.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.912
I'm going out
of my mind.

25:12.945 --> 25:13.980
What's your
husband's name?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.515
Sebastian Ballentine.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.120
[door opens]

25:22.354 --> 25:25.024
You're free to go,
Mr. Ballentine.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.893
Are you sure?

25:26.926 --> 25:28.094
Don't really feel like

25:28.127 --> 25:29.261
I've convinced
Detective Stabler yet.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.162
I'd hate to leave him

25:30.196 --> 25:31.631
with unresolved angst.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.966
Your wife and baby
are waiting.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.969
No, they aren't.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.839
Well, you finally
missed one, Kreskin.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.675
Mrs. Ballentine.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.843
Pookey.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.178
We were so worried.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.279
What are you doing here,
Carlene?

25:47.313 --> 25:48.881
I told you
I was working.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.117
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.351
She vouched for
your whereabouts

25:52.384 --> 25:54.220
during Kaley's abduction.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.655
You can go.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.156
But I'm not
ready to leave.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.224
(Cragen)
And why is that?

25:58.257 --> 25:59.626
Because we haven't found
a killer yet.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.027
I promised her mother.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.664
We've got people on it.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.933
Listen, I'm certain
that he's gonna hit again.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.034
I think you need
my help here.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.368
We need you at home.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.937
Henry J.
cried all night.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.271
He can sense when
Daddy's not around.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.876
I guess he inherits
that trait from his father.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.613
I hope so.
Isn't he the spitting image?

26:20.647 --> 26:24.016
Captain, we've got
a situation at St. Anne's.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.087
(man)
Sister Peg's room
is right down here.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.722
(Benson)
Well, when's the last time
anybody saw her?

26:29.756 --> 26:30.723
Late last night.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.125
People started to get
concerned by dinner time.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.828
She never leaves them hanging
at the soup kitchen.

26:35.862 --> 26:37.296
Sister Maria came in
looking for her.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.397
Found that.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.900
Check out the logo.

26:47.807 --> 26:48.975
Henshall & Langan.

26:49.008 --> 26:52.378
Kaley Sellers' clothes.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.146
That's a message for us,
screw you.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.948
He dumped them here
and then he took Sister Peg?

26:55.982 --> 26:59.018
While I wasted all my time
with that idiot, Sebastian.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.387
Elliot.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.222
Sebastian met her.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.391
When?

27:05.424 --> 27:08.661
Last night at the Precinct,
he talked to her.

27:08.695 --> 27:09.896
She even mentioned
St. Anne's.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.931
But he was with us.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.733
Why would he
go after Sister Peg?

27:13.766 --> 27:15.935
Kaley was selling
her virginity on the Internet.

27:15.968 --> 27:16.936
Sister Peg's a nun.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.072
In his sick mind,
that means she's a virgin.

27:20.106 --> 27:23.309
Just like Kaley.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.350
Damn!

27:31.383 --> 27:32.852
(Stabler)
Ballentine!

27:32.885 --> 27:34.954
Back in your house, lady.
There's nothing to see.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.023
[pounding doors]

27:37.056 --> 27:38.891
Sister Peg!

27:47.099 --> 27:48.334
There's nobody here,
Elliot.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.002
Well, he stashed her
somewhere.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.171
I think he's
on his way there right now.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.072
And he's gonna
come walking through

27:53.105 --> 27:55.975
what you left of his door
any second.

27:56.008 --> 27:59.145
Better hope Novak
can bootstrap us a warrant.

27:59.178 --> 27:59.979
Has he lost his mind?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.047
You tell them
to get out of there.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.850
Now.
But you can get us
a search warrant, right?

28:03.883 --> 28:05.952
No.
Let me
call you back.

28:05.985 --> 28:09.021
Casey, please.
This is Sister Peg.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.356
He could be assaulting her
right now.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.759
Do not make me
the bad guy on this.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.026
I'm not the one
who just violated

28:14.060 --> 28:15.127
someone's
constitutional rights.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.228
This is Sister Peg.

28:16.262 --> 28:19.999
She testified for you
on the Hector Ramirez case.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.167
And I would do anything
to help her,

28:21.200 --> 28:22.434
but no judge
in his right mind

28:22.468 --> 28:23.936
is gonna sign off
on a search warrant

28:23.970 --> 28:24.937
without probable cause.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.072
Look, I was there
when he met her.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.274
Fireworks went off when he
found out that she was a nun.

28:28.307 --> 28:31.811
Liv, he was in your precinct
the entire time.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.346
Which means that he has
to be working with a partner.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.314
They killed Kaley.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.083
The same thing is gonna
happen to Sister Peg.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.318
Oh, so you're
psychic now too.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.352
What?

28:43.022 --> 28:45.157
I'll be right there.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.159
Patrol just picked up
the Ballentines

28:47.193 --> 28:48.795
at an all night car wash,

28:48.828 --> 28:51.197
hosing out
the back of their van.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.867
Is it okay with you if we
bring him in for questioning?

28:56.268 --> 28:59.205
Now, you're gonna drop
the ESP crap right now.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.073
Where is she?

29:01.107 --> 29:01.941
Well, make up your mind.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.810
Do you want me
to use my gift or not?

29:03.843 --> 29:04.877
You know how dumb it was

29:04.911 --> 29:07.313
to go after someone
I know personally?

29:07.346 --> 29:08.881
How could I have
gone after her?

29:08.915 --> 29:11.183
I was here.

29:11.217 --> 29:14.153
Okay, smart guy.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.054
We know who
your partner is.

29:15.087 --> 29:19.391
He talks,
he gets the deal.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.294
I don't work with anyone.

29:22.328 --> 29:27.066
My business is very
solitary, actually.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.068
I'm a one-man show.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.874
(Benson)
Carlene, you were helping him
tamper with evidence.

29:34.907 --> 29:38.110
Well, how was
our van evidence?

29:38.144 --> 29:40.112
You don't think
it's a little strange

29:40.146 --> 29:43.182
to go to the car wash
in the middle of the night?

29:43.215 --> 29:45.952
Oh, no.
Henry J. threw up.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.855
Daddy can't stand
that smell in the car.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.857
We're looking
for a friend of his.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.392
Can you tell us
who he's close to?

29:53.425 --> 29:57.296
Henry J. and me
are everything to him.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.431
If he's not with us,
he's working.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.267
Does he have
a business partner?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.368
Me again.

30:02.401 --> 30:06.305
I mean, I don't have any
special abilities like him.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.575
I just make the appointments,
take care of the books.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.444
Whatever I can do to help.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.346
They being cooperative?

30:14.380 --> 30:17.183
No, and it's not
looking good.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.051
Sebastian is
too sharp to slip,

30:19.085 --> 30:21.220
and Carlene is almost
too dim to exist.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.221
We found a witness.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.189
Ballentines were
at the car wash

30:23.222 --> 30:24.290
at least a half an hour.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.291
Destroying evidence.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.625
We worked out a time line.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.227
Good news is they had
to go straight there

30:28.260 --> 30:29.095
after they left
the Precinct.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.097
Meaning, he hasn't seen
Sister Peg yet.

30:31.130 --> 30:31.898
Let's hope his partner

30:31.931 --> 30:33.565
is waiting on him
to get there.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.267
How many patient rapists
do you know?

30:35.301 --> 30:37.269
None. Luckily, I know a judge
with a drinking problem.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.104
Come again?

30:38.137 --> 30:39.538
I stopped by
his favorite watering hole

30:39.571 --> 30:41.240
and I assured him
that my search warrant

30:41.273 --> 30:42.508
contained
sufficient cause.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.509
And he signed it
without reading it.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.510
Now this gets you
into the van

30:44.543 --> 30:46.212
and the residence.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.646
Go.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.248
Hey, I fixed this,
you fix the door.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.384
What door?

30:53.385 --> 30:54.887
You find anything?

30:54.921 --> 30:57.156
No sign of violence.
Place is immaculate.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.457
A diary too much
to ask for?

30:58.490 --> 30:59.926
This guy didn't leave
a paper trail.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.527
I haven't even found
an address book.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.929
(Suarato)
I've got one.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.166
He keeps it
electronically.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.201
We're looking for the guy
he's working this with.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.402
This is mostly women.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.304
They all seem to cross-reference
with his appointment book.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.206
Those are his marks,
I need his partner.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.042
The names are all
set up as URLs.
What's that?

31:16.075 --> 31:18.677
Let's click and find out.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.046
Ingenious.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.313
He's searching them all
on Link-It.

31:21.347 --> 31:22.915
What's that,
like Google?

31:22.949 --> 31:24.616
This is a more sophisticated
search engine.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.252
It pulls up public records.

31:26.285 --> 31:29.388
Home addresses, mortgages,
driver's licenses--

31:29.421 --> 31:30.389
Social security number,

31:30.422 --> 31:31.924
court filings,
criminal records.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.926
Was his last search
Kaley Sellers?

31:33.960 --> 31:36.128
No.
Olivia Benson.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.129
You telling me
one click

31:37.163 --> 31:39.298
and he knows anybody's business?
Even a cop's?

31:39.331 --> 31:40.199
If he pays for it.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.433
Search before hers...

31:41.467 --> 31:44.403
Elliot Stabler.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.438
Oh, he's going
to kill Ballentine.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.007
This program isn't registered
to a Sebastian Ballentine.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.108
Who's it registered to?

31:49.141 --> 31:50.276
Henry Palaver.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.543
That's gotta be
his mystery partner.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.212
Give an address?

31:53.245 --> 31:56.315
Yeah.
In Canada.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.986
RCMP tells me Henry Palaver
was a guest of Bordeaux Prison

32:00.019 --> 32:02.154
in Montreal from '92 to '97.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.155
Sexual assault.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.256
And abduction of a minor.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.357
But no murder charge.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.392
Henry doesn't kill
his victims?

32:06.425 --> 32:07.659
Not on this occasion,

32:07.693 --> 32:10.096
but it's probably
the only reason he was caught.

32:10.129 --> 32:12.131
Girl was 14,
memorized his plates.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.165
14, another virgin.

32:13.199 --> 32:14.300
So this Henry Palaver

32:14.333 --> 32:16.302
is Sebastian's fellow
virgin hunter?

32:16.335 --> 32:17.703
Nope.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.338
They're the same person.

32:21.273 --> 32:24.276
Son of a bitch.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.046
We ran Sebastian's prints.
No criminal record.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.347
AFIS doesn't include
Canadian prints.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.016
Looks like the Palavers
have only been

32:30.049 --> 32:30.816
in the States
for six months.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.052
Living under
the name Ballentine.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.353
The wife took on
an assumed identity.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.755
She's got to know something.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.024
I don't understand.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.758
Well, it's simple math,
Carlene.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.428
Your tenth wedding anniversary
is coming up next month,

32:42.461 --> 32:45.431
but your husband has only been
out of prison for eight years.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.365
You had a jailhouse wedding,

32:46.398 --> 32:48.400
so you had to know
what he was in for.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.037
Didn't that bother you?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.405
You don't know him.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.374
Henry's the smartest,
sweetest,

32:55.407 --> 32:57.543
most charming man
I've ever met.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.678
He was doing time
for sexual assault.

33:03.415 --> 33:06.152
How did you two meet?

33:06.185 --> 33:08.120
Through a pen pal
program.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.421
With inmates.

33:09.455 --> 33:13.425
Can you imagine anyone
more in need of a friend?

33:13.459 --> 33:16.562
Poor things are completely
cut off from society.
Yes.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.331
That's the point
of putting them behind bars.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.433
You think that will
make them better?

33:21.467 --> 33:24.503
Sweetie, did you think
that you could?

33:24.536 --> 33:26.105
Yes.

33:26.138 --> 33:30.076
But you didn't
make him good.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.077
He made you bad.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.212
That's a mean thing to say.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.347
He's raping
and killing virgins.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.316
And you're helping him.
No.

33:37.349 --> 33:41.120
We found the search for Kaley
in your computer.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.055
You printed out directions
to St. Anne's

33:43.089 --> 33:44.223
on MapQuest last night.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.525
We found traces of blood
in your van.

33:46.558 --> 33:50.496
It's over, Carlene.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.498
I'd like to talk
to Henry, please.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.300
Why would you
go along with this?

33:57.236 --> 33:59.605
I was afraid...

33:59.638 --> 34:02.441
he'd leave me if I didn't.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.345
I thought if I could just
prove to him

34:06.378 --> 34:09.481
how much I loved him,

34:09.515 --> 34:11.717
he'd stop.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.086
How many girls
were there?

34:14.120 --> 34:17.189
Maybe...

34:17.223 --> 34:19.225
twelve.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.564
Who were they?

34:25.597 --> 34:29.135
Usually hitchhikers.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.369
[sniffles]

34:30.402 --> 34:32.471
Up in Canada.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.174
They thought nothing
of getting into a van

34:35.207 --> 34:36.575
with a nice married couple.

34:38.377 --> 34:41.747
Carlene, Sebastian was here
when Kaley was killed.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.484
You did that.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.555
I had to.

34:51.323 --> 34:54.426
I couldn't let him
go back to jail.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.528
Not when it was my fault.

34:56.562 --> 34:59.198
How was it your fault?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.769
Yeah, Henry.
How is it her fault?

35:03.802 --> 35:08.707
I wouldn't have had to rape
virgins if she'd been one.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.378
What?

35:12.411 --> 35:15.747
She completely
deceived me.

35:15.781 --> 35:19.685
She swore to me that she
was untouched when we met.

35:19.718 --> 35:24.656
He wasn't allowed
to have conjugal visits.

35:24.690 --> 35:29.428
So our honeymoon wasn't 'til
two years after the wedding.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.463
So you were unfaithful?

35:31.497 --> 35:33.565
Never.

35:35.534 --> 35:38.904
I was a virgin those entire
two years,

35:38.937 --> 35:40.572
[sniffles]

35:40.606 --> 35:42.308
but not before.

35:42.341 --> 35:47.546
I thought that would
be enough.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.816
I knew the second
I tried to...consummate--

35:50.849 --> 35:52.718
You couldn't perform.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.686
No.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.555
I could read her face
like a book.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.823
She was used goods.

35:57.856 --> 36:02.628
What is it about
this virgin compulsion?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.496
Afraid you're not gonna
measure up to other men?

36:04.530 --> 36:06.598
No, no, no.

36:06.632 --> 36:09.535
I'm more than adequate in bed.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.273
But the expression
on a girl's face

36:14.306 --> 36:16.742
her first time is...
incomparable.

36:16.775 --> 36:21.347
These girls weren't having sex,
they were being raped.

36:22.914 --> 36:26.618
Their faces
were palettes.

36:26.652 --> 36:30.522
Shock, confusion,
panic, fear.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.858
And always...

36:32.891 --> 36:37.329
just a soupcon of pain.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.601
Why'd you come here?
Hmm?

36:42.634 --> 36:43.635
You know, if you hadn't,

36:43.669 --> 36:45.471
you might've
gotten away with it.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.410
Well, I had to...

36:51.443 --> 36:54.946
see what I had
set into motion.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.716
Your expressions
were priceless.

36:59.785 --> 37:03.522
This place was like a beehive
that I poked with a stick.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.794
And also I just...

37:08.827 --> 37:11.663
I like to help.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.468
Tell me where
Sister Peg is.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.438
How would I know?

37:19.471 --> 37:21.773
Henry was here with us
when she was abducted.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.376
That means that you
had to have taken her.
No.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.545
I know this wasn't
your idea.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.680
He told you exactly
what to do, didn't he?

37:28.714 --> 37:30.015
I need to talk
to Henry, please.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.551
Where is she?
I'd just like
to see him.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.353
Did you hurt her?
No!

37:34.386 --> 37:36.988
Carlene, where is she?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.724
Sister Peg?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.426
Sister Peg,
hold on, we're here.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.793
Sister Peg?

37:41.827 --> 37:43.695
Sister Peg!

37:43.729 --> 37:45.397
[Elliot groans]

37:52.070 --> 37:54.673
I see a gash on the side
of her head.

37:54.706 --> 37:55.407
Her head's
been split open.

37:55.441 --> 37:58.310
I got a pulse,
I got a pulse.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.446
Sister Peg.
Sister Peg!

38:00.479 --> 38:01.713
Hey.
Hey.

38:01.747 --> 38:02.781
[gasps]

38:02.814 --> 38:05.684
It's okay.
It's us.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.353
[whimpers]
You have to save the baby.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.688
What baby?

38:09.721 --> 38:12.958
A woman said somebody left
a baby in the van.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.526
Relax, the bus is coming.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.594
It was freezing.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.431
He was in there all alone.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.433
It was naked and screaming.

38:21.467 --> 38:24.302
I-I crawled in to get him,
and I looked back.

38:26.872 --> 38:30.376
Last thing I saw was this woman
swinging a tire iron at me.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.810
It's okay.
She set you up.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.412
It was her baby.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.746
No, no.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.047
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we got her.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.583
We got her.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.718
The baby is fine.
He was never in any danger.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.953
He was.
He was.

38:41.987 --> 38:45.891
On the drive here, she was...
she was yelling at him.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.727
Said, uh, it was his fault

38:48.760 --> 38:51.663
his--his--his daddy
still needed to...

38:51.697 --> 38:53.665
cheat.

38:53.699 --> 38:59.705
Said, uh, she must have
picked a bad baby.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.016
[door closes]

39:11.049 --> 39:13.719
Carlene, tell me
about your baby again.

39:13.752 --> 39:14.820
What about him?

39:14.853 --> 39:19.057
Six months ago in Montreal,

39:19.090 --> 39:23.094
Dannette Lancour was eight
and a half months pregnant.

39:23.128 --> 39:26.131
Someone cut the fetus
out of her.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.737
Now, six months,
that's how old Henry J. is.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.104
That's when you fled Canada.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.707
No, Henry Junior is ours.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.576
We checked.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.645
There are no birth records
for Henry Junior.

39:39.678 --> 39:45.183
We can't find anyone who
remembers seeing you pregnant,

39:45.216 --> 39:47.719
who thought you were pregnant.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.821
Because you weren't.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.060
I couldn't stand
seeing Sebastian

39:55.093 --> 39:56.194
with those other girls.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.698
I did everything he asked.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.933
It was never enough.

40:01.967 --> 40:05.604
I thought if we could be
a real nuclear family

40:05.637 --> 40:07.072
that would fix everything.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.942
But it didn't.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.748
You can't have children
of your own.

40:18.984 --> 40:24.723
Sebastian knew
I wasn't a virgin.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.493
He couldn't touch me.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.597
You've never had sex
with your own husband.

40:32.898 --> 40:33.899
No.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.142
If I go to jail,

40:44.175 --> 40:46.678
will they let Henry Junior
come visit me?

40:46.712 --> 40:48.680
He's going back
to his real father,

40:48.714 --> 40:50.716
to the grieving husband
of the woman you butchered.

40:50.749 --> 40:51.850
But I'm the only mother
he knows.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.819
You stupid, dizzy cow!

40:53.852 --> 40:54.953
I'm sorry, I love you.

40:54.986 --> 40:55.954
Let her go, Ballentine.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.589
(Sebastian)
Are you happy now?

40:57.623 --> 40:58.857
That's what I get
for associating

40:58.890 --> 41:00.025
with a filthy slut.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.159
Let her go.

41:03.729 --> 41:04.730
Take the whore away.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.031
Please don't say that.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.566
Get her out of here.
Henry, please...

41:07.599 --> 41:09.835
You said if I did
all those things for you,

41:09.868 --> 41:11.637
you'd never leave me.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.238
You promised me.

41:13.271 --> 41:14.239
I lied!

41:14.272 --> 41:16.808
[crying]

41:25.150 --> 41:27.719
Well, this was fun.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.889
Best sex I ever had.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.626
You know, they're looking to
extradite your sorry ass

41:34.660 --> 41:35.861
back to Canada.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.964
I'm gonna make damn sure
you stay right here.

41:42.768 --> 41:44.570
I believe you
really mean that.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.842
I kinda grew on you,
didn't I?

41:58.950 --> 41:59.017
