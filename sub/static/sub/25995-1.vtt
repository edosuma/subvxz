The train approaching platform three

00:42.270 --> 00:46.310
is the 20:55 service to London Euston.

00:53.464 --> 00:57.323
Cover yourself up, Ella.
We're not there yet. Good girl.

00:57.324 --> 01:00.243
Sh, sh, sh. Not our stop yet.

01:00.244 --> 01:01.884
Back to sleep.

01:23.004 --> 01:25.084
This train is about to depart.

01:42.610 --> 01:44.090
Stand clear of the doors.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.364
Stand clear of the doors.

02:40.924 --> 02:42.764
Excuse me.

02:46.604 --> 02:49.004
Is everything all right in there?

03:16.004 --> 03:18.923
Sorry, madam. You wouldn't mind
looking after my kids

03:18.924 --> 03:20.883
for a minute, would you?
I'll be right back.

03:20.884 --> 03:22.381
Yeah. No problem.

03:22.406 --> 03:24.204
Thank you very much. I'll be right back.

03:29.044 --> 03:31.563
Suspicious in toilet C-D.

03:31.564 --> 03:34.003
Sergeant David Budd, Metropolitan Police.

03:34.004 --> 03:35.124
What's going on?

03:36.740 --> 03:39.860
You've got an intelligence report
for an Asian male in his 20s?

03:40.564 --> 03:41.763
How do you know about that?

03:41.764 --> 03:43.843
I saw you checking out
the guy in my carriage.

03:43.844 --> 03:46.283
He's fine but I saw someone
acting suspiciously at Marston.

03:46.284 --> 03:48.323
I don't know if he succeeded
in boarding the train

03:48.324 --> 03:49.780
but, if he did,
he could be in the toilet.

03:51.684 --> 03:53.563
Look, I'm an Operational
Firearms Commander

03:53.564 --> 03:56.364
with Specialist Protection.
What's the plan?

04:00.804 --> 04:03.443
British Transport Police have
put out an alert on a possible

04:03.444 --> 04:06.163
suicide bomber attempting to
board a London-bound service.

04:06.164 --> 04:08.323
We've been ordered to stop
the train at Barnet Shed.

04:08.324 --> 04:10.883
It's a derelict depot out in the sticks.

04:13.444 --> 04:15.163
They're going to board the train.

04:15.164 --> 04:16.964
How long till we get there?

04:17.923 --> 04:20.723
- Seven minutes.
- He won't detonate in the toilet.

04:20.724 --> 04:23.100
He'll go into the carriage
for maximum casualties.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.700
Right, stick with me on this.
What's your name?

04:26.404 --> 04:29.043
- Sandra.
- Give me your number.

04:29.044 --> 04:34.323
Uh... 07700900876.

04:34.324 --> 04:35.844
- I need to call this in.
- Do it.

04:51.364 --> 04:54.844
This way, Sarge.
We'll take you down to track-side.

05:19.644 --> 05:22.083
I need a few more minutes.
Is that all right?

05:22.084 --> 05:24.324
- Yeah. No problem.
- Thank you.

05:55.884 --> 05:57.643
- Hello?
- I can't let him get out of there.

05:57.644 --> 05:59.267
There's dozens of
passengers on this train,

05:59.292 --> 06:00.483
- my kids included.
- What?

06:00.484 --> 06:02.723
Can you unlock the exit doors
while the train's moving?

06:02.724 --> 06:04.444
Hello?

06:06.524 --> 06:08.364
Shit.

06:10.644 --> 06:11.684
Shit.

06:18.364 --> 06:19.724
Fuck.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.204
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

06:36.484 --> 06:37.643
What I said is can you...?

06:37.644 --> 06:40.203
The stop's just a few minutes away.
Let's not do anything to...

06:40.204 --> 06:42.568
If he feels the train brake,
he'll know it's an unscheduled stop.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.881
He'll go into the carriage and
detonate the device. No.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.260
Can you unlock the doors while
the train's moving or not?

06:48.004 --> 06:50.563
- Yes.
- When I say so, do it.

06:50.564 --> 06:52.804
- Let me take care of the rest.
- The rest of what?

06:54.084 --> 06:55.960
To throw him off the train.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.017
Stand by.

07:19.604 --> 07:21.124
Do it now.

08:00.244 --> 08:02.883
Subject does not appear
to be carrying a device.

08:02.884 --> 08:05.483
He's an Asian male, late 20s,
wearing a black baseball cap,

08:05.484 --> 08:07.643
grey T-shirt and carrying a green coat.

08:07.644 --> 08:10.723
Advise SCO19 he's heading towards
the front of the train and does not

08:10.724 --> 08:13.764
appear to be a threat. Repeat,
does not appear to be a threat.

08:17.124 --> 08:19.900
I'm going to examine the toilet
for signs of a device.

08:20.564 --> 08:22.483
Trojan, Control, active message.

08:22.484 --> 08:23.643
Trojan receiving.

08:23.644 --> 08:26.323
Subject is at front of train,
no visible device,

08:26.324 --> 08:27.723
to be detained for questioning.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.083
Proceed as planned.

08:29.084 --> 08:31.963
- Copy.
- Train ETA's three minutes.

08:31.964 --> 08:33.404
Three minutes!

08:54.324 --> 08:55.644
Assalaamu Alaikum.

09:00.404 --> 09:01.764
I just want to talk.

09:03.364 --> 09:04.684
That's all.

09:09.964 --> 09:11.844
I can see you're as scared as I am.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.804
Miss, I just want to help you.

09:19.244 --> 09:20.604
You don't have to do this.

09:22.644 --> 09:24.300
You can change your mind.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.403
Don't do that! Please don't do that!
Don't move. Stay still.

09:27.404 --> 09:31.323
Please. Just stay still.
Please! Just stay still. Don't move.

09:31.324 --> 09:32.683
Please. Please!

09:51.564 --> 09:53.244
You don't want to do this.

09:55.484 --> 09:57.403
You don't look like you do.

09:57.404 --> 10:00.603
Listen, the specialist
counter-terrorism unit

10:00.604 --> 10:03.883
already know about a potential
incident on this train.

10:03.884 --> 10:06.524
So what I'd like to do
is just tell them...

10:08.377 --> 10:09.857
...that you're willing to talk.

10:11.724 --> 10:13.620
Does that sound OK to you?

10:14.404 --> 10:16.302
Just talk, is that a start?

10:23.564 --> 10:25.683
There's a second bomber...

10:25.684 --> 10:27.403
...but we're talking.

10:27.404 --> 10:29.123
Now write this down.

10:29.124 --> 10:30.963
Young Asian female,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.123
equipped with an explosives vest.

10:33.124 --> 10:36.163
Advise SCO19 she's willing to talk.

10:36.164 --> 10:40.883
Request armed officers hold back
from boarding the train

10:40.884 --> 10:43.163
and that bomb disposal and negotiators

10:43.164 --> 10:45.443
are deployed as operational priority.

10:45.444 --> 10:49.603
But firstly, right now,
evacuate the adjacent carriages.

10:49.604 --> 10:51.500
Yeah. OK.

10:56.164 --> 10:58.603
This is your guard speaking.

10:58.604 --> 11:01.603
Would all passengers in carriage D

11:01.604 --> 11:06.963
please make your way at once
into carriages E and F?

11:06.964 --> 11:11.483
And would all passengers in
carriage C please make your way

11:11.484 --> 11:14.443
- immediately into carriages B and A?
- Come on, wake up. We've got to move.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.444
- Where's Daddy?
- Wake up.

11:17.015 --> 11:18.134
I'll just have a look

11:18.135 --> 11:21.163
and make sure that everyone's
getting out all right. OK?

11:21.164 --> 11:24.380
All right? I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

11:32.204 --> 11:36.004
It's OK. It's OK.

11:37.324 --> 11:39.123
My name's David.

11:39.124 --> 11:40.883
David Budd.

11:40.884 --> 11:42.124
What's yours?

11:50.004 --> 11:51.204
Nadia.

11:52.524 --> 11:54.923
The man that was in here before,

11:54.924 --> 11:57.124
is that your husband?

12:00.444 --> 12:01.764
Yeah?

12:03.404 --> 12:05.524
And your husband wants you to die?

12:07.604 --> 12:10.123
You don't have to be a martyr, Nadia.

12:10.124 --> 12:12.323
We can deactivate this device

12:12.324 --> 12:14.403
and we can protect you from your husband.

12:14.404 --> 12:17.460
You don't ever have to see him
again if you don't want to.

12:19.804 --> 12:21.803
Hey, Nadia.

12:21.804 --> 12:23.020
Nadia, look at me.

12:24.364 --> 12:27.763
I'm just as scared as you are, I promise.

12:27.764 --> 12:30.884
I'm just bringing my kids back
from visiting my mum.

12:32.724 --> 12:34.643
You have children?

12:34.644 --> 12:36.620
Yes. I do. Two.

12:39.004 --> 12:42.660
That's Ella. She's ten.
Charlie. He's eight.

12:45.844 --> 12:48.220
I just want to take them home
to their mum.

12:57.764 --> 13:01.363
Trojan, Control, we've got
a sit rep from the train guard.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.203
There's an off-duty specialist
protection officer on board.

13:04.204 --> 13:05.963
PS David Budd.

13:05.964 --> 13:07.180
Received.

13:11.804 --> 13:13.643
Stand by.

13:13.644 --> 13:15.060
It's all right.

13:15.724 --> 13:17.883
Everything's going to be all right.

13:21.524 --> 13:24.843
Stop! Please! Stop!
Listen to me. Listen to me.

13:24.844 --> 13:27.643
Why would someone you love want
you to kill yourself?

13:27.644 --> 13:29.403
You've been brainwashed.

13:29.404 --> 13:31.403
He has. You have.

13:31.404 --> 13:33.123
And I know.

13:33.124 --> 13:35.682
I was in Afghanistan.
I saw mates get killed.

13:35.683 --> 13:38.043
Nearly got killed myself.
For what? Nothing.

13:38.044 --> 13:41.003
Politicians. Cowards and liars.
Ours and theirs.

13:41.004 --> 13:43.763
People full of talk but will never
spill a drop of their own blood.

13:43.764 --> 13:46.923
But you and I,
we're just collateral damage.

13:46.924 --> 13:48.980
Don't let them win, Nadia.

13:49.964 --> 13:51.284
Don't let them win.

13:57.364 --> 14:00.020
Police officer! Don't shoot!

14:03.924 --> 14:06.723
All right? Stay right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

14:06.724 --> 14:08.643
You hear that?

14:08.644 --> 14:11.083
That's them evacuating
everyone from the train.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.483
So it's just you and I.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.120
It's just us here. OK?

14:15.724 --> 14:19.843
- Armed police! Armed police!
- Get down on the ground!

14:19.844 --> 14:23.923
Put your hands on your head
and get down! Get down!

14:23.924 --> 14:25.620
Don't move!

14:29.724 --> 14:34.300
Stay exactly where you are, Nadia.
Don't move, OK? All right.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.603
Armed Police!

14:36.604 --> 14:39.483
PS David Budd,
specialist protection! Don't shoot!

14:39.484 --> 14:41.803
We know who you are! Stand clear!

14:41.804 --> 14:45.163
It's all right. I'm not going anywhere.

14:45.164 --> 14:48.843
Just stay very still now, Nadia. OK?

14:48.844 --> 14:50.363
David, work with me, yeah?

14:50.364 --> 14:53.683
You've done a great job
but you're not OFC here. I am.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.963
I need you to stand down, nice and easy.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.843
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here with you.

14:59.844 --> 15:03.083
It's all right. Nothing's changed.
It's just us talking here.

15:03.084 --> 15:07.284
- Just stay, really, really still.
- OK? Move... away... from the subject.

15:14.924 --> 15:16.250
In position.

15:16.275 --> 15:18.643
It's OK, Nadia. It's all right. It's OK.

15:18.644 --> 15:21.883
TFC reports sniper in position.
Critical shot authorised.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.003
Received.

15:23.004 --> 15:25.444
Nadia, I need you to trust me.

15:25.860 --> 15:28.563
I'm going to turn round
and speak to this officer.

15:28.564 --> 15:31.003
She's cooperating.
She intends to surrender.

15:31.004 --> 15:34.163
She does not intend to activate
the device. Get Expo here.

15:34.164 --> 15:36.060
They're here. Now move away.

15:37.284 --> 15:40.460
It's all right. It's OK.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm not.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.483
David, stand clear.

15:42.484 --> 15:46.083
Nadia, you need to show them you're
not going to detonate the device.

15:46.084 --> 15:47.203
Now, when I ask you to,

15:47.204 --> 15:49.643
I want you to raise your arms
either side of you.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.003
Can you do that for me when I ask?

15:51.004 --> 15:52.803
This is your final warning. Stand clear!

15:52.804 --> 15:55.044
Nadia's going to spread her arms

15:55.500 --> 15:58.483
and we're going to stay put
and wait for Expo.

15:58.484 --> 16:00.363
Trojan OFC to TFC.

16:00.364 --> 16:03.083
PS Budd has been given repeated
warnings to stand down but has

16:03.084 --> 16:05.683
failed to cooperate. We have
no clear shot of the subject.

16:05.684 --> 16:08.083
That's it, nice and slow.
Stay close to me.

16:08.084 --> 16:10.803
Come in. Come in, close to me. That's it.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.883
All right, doing really well.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.123
Doing really well, Nadia.

16:15.124 --> 16:17.323
That gun, that's an MCX carbine.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.643
A bullet from that would go
through the both of us.

16:19.644 --> 16:22.483
I'm trusting they're not going
to shoot one of their own.

16:22.484 --> 16:25.140
All right? You trust me too?

16:26.644 --> 16:27.684
OK.

16:29.404 --> 16:30.964
Shit.

16:31.519 --> 16:33.163
Shit. Oh, come on.

16:33.164 --> 16:35.643
Control to Sniper 1.
Do you have a clean shot?

16:35.644 --> 16:37.003
Negative.

16:37.004 --> 16:40.683
Stay in there. Don't go out.
Stay here. Stay here with me.

16:40.684 --> 16:43.603
Subject required out of toilet
for critical shot.

16:43.604 --> 16:46.323
- Received.
- Get Expo here, now!

16:46.324 --> 16:49.577
David, I need the subject
to step out of the toilet.

16:49.578 --> 16:51.816
No, she's going to stay here
and wait for Expo.

16:51.817 --> 16:54.003
- That's what we're going to do.
- Don't move. Come out of the toilet.

16:54.004 --> 16:56.563
- Come out of the toilet.
- Stay really still for me, will you?

16:56.564 --> 16:58.700
- That's it. You're doing really good.
- Out now, miss. Listen to me.

16:58.701 --> 17:00.755
- Get Expo here.
- David, stand aside.

17:00.780 --> 17:02.868
Don't fire! Do not do this!

17:05.924 --> 17:08.723
- You need to come out of the toilet!
- Don't do this! Don't do this!

17:08.723 --> 17:11.083
Nadia, stay there, don't move.
Please don't move, Nadia!

17:11.084 --> 17:13.403
- Step out of the toilet!
- Don't do this. Don't do this.

17:13.404 --> 17:15.563
- Please don't do this.
- David, stand down! Out! OUT!

17:15.564 --> 17:18.992
- Stay here! That's it. Don't do this!
- Get out of the fucking toilet!

17:18.992 --> 17:20.200
No!

17:25.884 --> 17:30.083
- No shot!
- All right. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

17:30.084 --> 17:32.941
All right, Nadia. Hold tight. That's it.

17:32.942 --> 17:35.243
Just keep moving. Hold tight.

17:35.244 --> 17:39.420
OK. All right.

17:41.444 --> 17:44.603
Control to Sniper 1.
Can you execute critical shot?

17:44.604 --> 17:46.060
Negative.

17:46.884 --> 17:48.500
That's it, Nadia.

17:49.583 --> 17:54.023
No clean shot available.
Repeat, no clean shot available.

17:55.644 --> 17:58.524
- Expo.
- Control. Sending Expo in now.

17:59.684 --> 18:01.483
Expo is coming.

18:01.484 --> 18:02.980
Thank you.

18:03.924 --> 18:06.084
All right, Nadia. I've got you.

18:15.364 --> 18:16.804
Explosives officer.

18:18.284 --> 18:22.523
Stay calm. Stay calm.

18:22.524 --> 18:25.443
Miss? My name's Karen.

18:25.444 --> 18:28.044
Now I need you to put your arms down.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.310
Good. Now turn your palms towards me...

18:33.864 --> 18:35.144
...and do not move.

18:38.564 --> 18:40.683
Nadia, I'm going to step to the side.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.460
I'll be right here.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.644
I'm moving towards you now.

18:47.204 --> 18:50.740
Nadia, now I need to ask you...

18:51.484 --> 18:55.044
...this object in your hand
is the initiation device?

18:56.684 --> 18:58.163
Yes.

18:58.164 --> 19:00.724
Does anyone else have
control of this device?

19:04.637 --> 19:05.797
No.

19:08.204 --> 19:10.164
Straighten your arm, please.

19:35.644 --> 19:37.044
Arms up, please.

19:38.564 --> 19:39.604
All the way up.

19:41.964 --> 19:43.404
Turn around for me, please.

19:47.124 --> 19:49.124
I'm going to remove the belt.

20:21.644 --> 20:23.283
I need everyone out now.

20:23.284 --> 20:24.564
Open the door.

20:31.524 --> 20:34.963
I'm going to step off the train,
then ask you to follow me.

20:34.964 --> 20:36.524
All right?

20:43.724 --> 20:45.700
OK, nice and slowly.

20:46.124 --> 20:48.244
Keep your hands where we can see them.

20:56.404 --> 20:57.607
Stay calm.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.606
Stay still and we'll lift
you down to the ground.

20:59.607 --> 21:01.283
- Stay still!
- Nadia!

21:01.284 --> 21:05.083
Don't look over there. Look down at
the ground. Down at the ground.

21:05.084 --> 21:08.084
Go! Go! Let's go!

21:13.804 --> 21:16.883
It's over. You're safe now.

21:16.884 --> 21:19.540
He can't hurt you.
No-one's going to hurt you.

21:51.964 --> 21:53.844
Come on. Out you get.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.498
- Thanks, mate.
- Oh, God.

21:58.523 --> 22:00.403
- Mummy!
- Thank God! Come here.

22:00.404 --> 22:01.940
Oh.

22:02.524 --> 22:05.003
Oh, sweetheart.

22:05.004 --> 22:08.924
Sorry. By the time
I'd given a statement, I...

22:09.300 --> 22:11.616
- Love, it's all right.
- Thank you.

22:11.617 --> 22:13.460
I'm fine. Look, we're all fine.

22:14.084 --> 22:15.643
It's all right.

22:15.644 --> 22:18.714
Night-night, sweetheart. I love you.

22:18.715 --> 22:21.403
Night-night, Charlie bear. Goodnight.

22:21.404 --> 22:23.843
Night-night, sweetheart.

22:23.844 --> 22:26.523
Night, big man. Night.

22:26.524 --> 22:28.324
- I love you.
- I love you too.

22:42.084 --> 22:44.060
They'll be all right, love.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.483
I should be heading off.

22:46.484 --> 22:47.724
You don't have to.

22:50.458 --> 22:51.778
You sure?

22:53.164 --> 22:55.004
Are you feeling OK?

23:06.044 --> 23:08.164
Come on. Let's talk downstairs.

23:11.810 --> 23:13.730
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dave.

23:16.364 --> 23:17.820
Sorry.

23:19.844 --> 23:22.323
I'm sorry. I'm a fucking idiot.

23:22.324 --> 23:23.844
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.541
Terrorists armed with a suicide vest

23:40.542 --> 23:43.403
boarded the London-bound train
just before...

23:43.404 --> 23:45.643
...the Prime Minister has called a
meeting of Cobra...

23:45.644 --> 23:47.163
No-one was injured in the attack

23:47.164 --> 23:49.563
on a packed train en route to
London Euston Station.

23:49.564 --> 23:51.879
...and we would urge members of
the public to remain vigilant...

23:51.880 --> 23:53.803
...the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre

23:53.804 --> 23:55.403
will assess the current threat level.

23:55.404 --> 23:56.763
My Government remains resolute

23:56.764 --> 23:58.603
in our determination
to root out terrorism.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.843
JTAC has the raised the threat
level from moderate to substantial.

24:01.844 --> 24:05.043
What I'm being told is most
worrying about yesterday's incident

24:05.044 --> 24:08.723
is the exceptionally high level of
sophistication of the explosive vest

24:08.724 --> 24:10.643
employed by the would-be attackers.

24:10.644 --> 24:14.163
It would appear most likely that
this is the work of a terror cell

24:14.164 --> 24:17.283
and there may well be
accomplices still at large.

24:17.284 --> 24:19.763
Frank Gardner, there,
our security correspondent.

24:19.764 --> 24:21.483
- Morning, Sarge.
- Cheers, Ken.

24:21.484 --> 24:23.963
...the level of sophistication
of the 1st of October device

24:23.964 --> 24:27.763
and the very real concern that it
represents a new and devastating

24:27.764 --> 24:31.883
threat to national security has led
the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre

24:31.884 --> 24:36.243
to raise the UK's terror threat
level to substantial.

24:36.244 --> 24:38.419
We're joined now by the Home Secretary,

24:38.420 --> 24:40.923
the Right Honourable Julia Montague, MP.

24:40.924 --> 24:44.643
Before we begin, Nick, I'd like
to pay tribute to the courage of

24:44.644 --> 24:47.083
all members of the police
and security service

24:47.084 --> 24:50.524
whose selfless actions prevented
an appalling act of terrorism.

24:58.924 --> 25:00.963
Bit of a day yesterday.

25:00.964 --> 25:03.643
If you need some time off or for me
to refer you to occ health

25:03.644 --> 25:06.163
- for some counselling...
- I'm fine, thanks, ma'am.

25:06.164 --> 25:07.763
It's a miracle you're in one piece.

25:07.764 --> 25:09.858
We're all very lucky the
bomber changed her mind.

25:09.883 --> 25:10.976
Hm.

25:10.977 --> 25:14.243
Not that she's saying much.
And the husband's saying nothing.

25:14.244 --> 25:17.403
It seems like when the time came
she froze and the husband panicked.

25:17.404 --> 25:18.444
Yeah.

25:19.924 --> 25:23.163
Great job, David. A credit to the branch.

25:23.164 --> 25:24.660
Thank you, ma'am.

25:25.244 --> 25:28.283
So far you've acted as PPO to
visiting foreign dignitaries?

25:28.284 --> 25:29.683
That's right, ma'am.

25:29.684 --> 25:31.003
The commissioner's ordered me

25:31.004 --> 25:34.003
to review specialist protection
on senior politicians.

25:34.004 --> 25:36.483
I'm assigning you to a Cabinet minister.

25:36.484 --> 25:38.323
The Home Secretary.

25:38.324 --> 25:39.940
Very good, ma'am.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.300
It's a move up.

25:42.764 --> 25:44.324
Yes.

25:44.604 --> 25:46.004
Thank you, ma'am.

25:47.950 --> 25:49.190
Good man.

25:50.263 --> 25:51.623
Ma'am.

26:32.384 --> 26:36.666
_

26:39.600 --> 26:43.740
_

27:16.124 --> 27:18.044
My Glock and two magazines, please.

27:49.724 --> 27:52.083
That's the principal now,
skipper, in the first car.

27:52.084 --> 27:53.323
The backup's behind.

27:53.324 --> 27:56.564
Her driver's Terry
and the PPO's PC Tom Fenton.

28:01.924 --> 28:03.443
- Ma'am.
- Kim.

28:03.444 --> 28:05.883
Ma'am, this is PS Budd, the new PPO.

28:05.884 --> 28:08.363
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
I was wondering if we could

28:08.364 --> 28:10.923
discuss you using the underground
entrance from now on?

28:10.924 --> 28:12.564
I'm late for a meeting.

28:13.857 --> 28:15.577
Julia likes to be seen.

28:26.524 --> 28:29.203
- What's happening with Andrew Marr?
- I'll chase them today.

28:29.204 --> 28:30.763
I thought it was all confirmed.

28:30.764 --> 28:33.763
There's a possibility
that Number 10 want the slot.

28:33.764 --> 28:35.963
And when were you planning to tell me?

28:35.964 --> 28:38.243
I was waiting for the right moment.

28:38.244 --> 28:39.684
You didn't find it.

28:46.084 --> 28:48.723
Sierra Zulu 7-2 from Control.

28:48.724 --> 28:50.563
Go ahead, Control. 7-2 over.

28:50.564 --> 28:55.163
7-2, do you have an ETA for Tulip
to arrive at Melbourne?

28:55.164 --> 28:59.284
Control, traffic is heavy,
ETA 12 minutes. 7-2 over.

29:00.884 --> 29:04.844
7-2, can you call up when
one minute away? Control out.

29:36.684 --> 29:39.203
Rob Macdonald, special advisor
to the Home Secretary.

29:39.204 --> 29:40.323
Leave a message.

29:40.324 --> 29:42.963
Hi, it's me. We need to catch up.

29:42.964 --> 29:44.443
Come to the flat.

29:44.444 --> 29:47.364
Not sure what time I'll be home.
Depends on the traffic.

29:51.884 --> 29:54.180
Cross the river and take the south circ.

29:55.084 --> 29:57.123
Terry's been driving me for three years.

29:57.124 --> 29:59.564
I think he can be trusted to
determine the fastest route.

30:00.644 --> 30:02.283
I've made a dynamic risk assessment

30:02.284 --> 30:05.203
and, given the current threat level,
I'm recommending a diversion.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.043
How much longer will that take?

30:07.044 --> 30:09.403
Can't say for certain, ma'am.

30:09.404 --> 30:12.403
In that case we'll just take the
usual route, please, Terry.

30:12.404 --> 30:14.043
Take the south circ, if you don't mind.

30:14.044 --> 30:17.003
My job's to keep you safe, ma'am.
I won't tell you how to do yours.

30:17.004 --> 30:19.420
No, but you're happy to make it harder.

30:31.484 --> 30:35.380
47-79, we'll park up across
the road and wait.

30:51.804 --> 30:53.084
Ma'am.

31:01.884 --> 31:04.804
If you wouldn't mind holding
here a moment, please, ma'am.

31:15.084 --> 31:16.160
Hi.

31:16.185 --> 31:17.483
I've just remembered I've got nothing in.

31:17.484 --> 31:19.042
Are you all right to pick up a takeaway?

31:19.067 --> 31:20.163
Not a problem. Usual?

31:20.164 --> 31:21.580
Sure.

31:27.124 --> 31:28.980
May I ask what you're doing?

31:29.580 --> 31:31.083
What's behind this door?

31:31.084 --> 31:32.923
My study.

31:32.924 --> 31:35.763
Seriously? I'm expecting a colleague
and I need you to fuck off.

31:35.764 --> 31:36.804
No offence.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.571
None taken.

31:53.764 --> 31:56.203
That was us plotting
to build the Death Star.

31:56.204 --> 31:57.643
How long's this going to take?

31:57.644 --> 31:59.604
Can't say for certain, ma'am.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.210
Just get on with it.

32:29.884 --> 32:32.603
- PC Knowles said your name's Budd.
- Yes, ma'am.

32:32.604 --> 32:36.030
The officer who prevented the 1st of
October rail attack. That was you?

32:36.031 --> 32:37.158
Yes, ma'am.

32:38.924 --> 32:40.363
It's been a long and trying day.

32:40.364 --> 32:42.820
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

32:43.877 --> 32:45.277
Thank you, ma'am.

32:48.597 --> 32:49.917
All is forgiven.

32:51.444 --> 32:52.963
As you wish, ma'am.

32:52.964 --> 32:55.244
No, really, I've been a total cow.

32:56.464 --> 32:58.024
All is forgiven.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.700
Thank you.

33:09.484 --> 33:11.228
- Skip...
- Evening.

33:11.253 --> 33:13.388
Mr Macdonald visiting the principal.

33:24.450 --> 33:25.570
I can get it.

33:35.059 --> 33:37.179
Oh. Hello.

33:37.204 --> 33:38.524
Evening, sir.

33:39.644 --> 33:40.683
Rob Macdonald.

33:40.684 --> 33:42.803
Perfect timing. I'm starving.
Come through.

33:42.804 --> 33:44.163
Sergeant Budd won't be long.

33:44.164 --> 33:45.683
Actually, I'm all done, ma'am.

33:45.684 --> 33:46.883
Thank you, Sergeant.

33:46.884 --> 33:48.963
Couple of prawn crackers going
if you want some?

33:48.964 --> 33:50.284
No, thank you, sir.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.730
- Have a good evening, ma'am.
- You too.

33:57.684 --> 33:59.324
I got this for later.

34:20.964 --> 34:22.443
Evening, lads.

34:22.444 --> 34:23.484
Skip.

34:26.603 --> 34:31.060
Control, Sierra Zulu 7-9.
We're state 11 handing off to DPG.

35:07.244 --> 35:08.283
Hello.

35:08.284 --> 35:09.460
Hiya, love.

35:11.524 --> 35:12.683
You OK?

35:12.684 --> 35:14.724
Yeah. I'm just calling for a chat.

35:15.964 --> 35:17.444
About what?

35:20.644 --> 35:22.483
Just calling for a chat, Vic.

35:22.484 --> 35:23.963
What do you want?

35:23.964 --> 35:26.483
What do I want?
I'm just calling to say hello.

35:26.484 --> 35:28.163
Just missed you, that's all.

35:28.164 --> 35:29.924
SHE SIGHS Don't start.

35:31.124 --> 35:34.700
Why can't we just have a chat
like two normal adults, Vicky?

35:35.084 --> 35:37.180
This is not normal.

35:39.084 --> 35:42.683
Vicky, I've put a lid on it.
I'm handling things.

35:42.684 --> 35:46.483
I know what happens when you call
late with a few drinks inside you.

35:46.484 --> 35:48.083
I've not even had a few drinks.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.083
Vicky.

35:51.084 --> 35:54.563
Vicky, let's just have a chat.
Let's just have a chat!

35:54.564 --> 35:56.095
- Not now.
- Vic.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.643
No. Not like this.

35:57.644 --> 35:58.963
Vicky.

36:01.884 --> 36:03.204
Shit!

36:05.684 --> 36:08.363
There is a heightened
police presence at airports,

36:08.364 --> 36:09.723
railway stations and other...

36:09.724 --> 36:11.630
...failed 1st of October rail
attack has triggered a hunt

36:11.631 --> 36:14.563
- for accomplices. Counter-terrorism
- officers believe...

36:14.564 --> 36:16.283
...ignited a debate on national security,

36:16.284 --> 36:18.323
which has the potential to
split the Government.

36:18.324 --> 36:20.243
The Prime Minister,
considered a moderate...

36:20.244 --> 36:23.123
The Home Secretary's efforts to
enhance surveillance powers through

36:23.124 --> 36:27.844
a new Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Bill, so-called RIPA-18...

36:34.404 --> 36:37.243
Home Secretary, two minutes till
I take you through to the studio.

36:37.244 --> 36:38.284
Thank you.

36:44.244 --> 36:48.324
I bet the PM pulled out because he
knew you'd do a much better job.

36:48.577 --> 36:50.740
Sounds like a reason NOT to pull out.

36:53.364 --> 36:54.723
Your decaf.

36:54.724 --> 36:56.843
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- Shit.

36:56.844 --> 36:59.160
- Christ!
- Shit.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.883
SHE LAUGHS. I'm sorry. Shut up.

37:02.884 --> 37:05.163
- Give her your blouse.
- It'll never fit.

37:05.164 --> 37:07.723
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Give her yours, then.

37:07.724 --> 37:09.883
I don't wear blouses, do I?

37:09.884 --> 37:11.723
Can we dry it out?

37:11.724 --> 37:14.220
Don't be ridiculous. There's no time.

37:14.924 --> 37:17.043
Fresh on this morning, ma'am.

37:17.044 --> 37:18.723
You've got to be kidding me.

37:18.724 --> 37:21.083
My shirts are altered to
fit over my ballistic vest

37:21.084 --> 37:23.980
so the chest-to-waist ratio
should be compatible.

37:24.404 --> 37:26.843
Well, don't all stand around gawping.

37:26.844 --> 37:30.060
And you, fuck off and organise
Sergeant Budd a new shirt.

37:33.764 --> 37:35.900
You'll have to tuck it
under your jacket, ma'am.

37:36.777 --> 37:38.097
Thank you.

37:42.604 --> 37:44.083
Some privacy?

37:44.084 --> 37:45.404
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

38:02.004 --> 38:03.123
Home Secretary,

38:03.124 --> 38:06.123
just how anxious should we be
about this terrorist threat?

38:06.124 --> 38:08.123
Is there another one around the corner?

38:08.124 --> 38:09.563
We are a target.

38:09.564 --> 38:11.643
We can't be complacent.

38:11.644 --> 38:15.443
Now, I am committed to supporting
our security services

38:15.444 --> 38:18.923
by giving them greater powers
to confront greater threats.

38:18.924 --> 38:21.803
The Government is intent on
forcing through a beefed-up

38:21.804 --> 38:25.123
Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act this year,

38:25.124 --> 38:29.043
RIPA-18 as it's been dubbed,
spearheaded by you,

38:29.044 --> 38:32.407
but critics are calling it
a snoopers' charter to monitor

38:32.408 --> 38:36.923
phone calls, e-mails and social
media without judicial review.

38:36.924 --> 38:41.323
Andrew, only those intent on acts
of violence have anything to fear.

38:41.324 --> 38:43.803
And the Prime Minister has been
quoted as saying that,

38:43.804 --> 38:45.283
"Lessons need to be learned

38:45.284 --> 38:47.963
"from our military interventions
in the Middle East."

38:47.964 --> 38:50.243
So what do you think
those lessons might be?

38:50.244 --> 38:53.803
I can't see any justification
for believing the Taliban would

38:53.804 --> 38:57.443
govern Afghanistan in peace
and harmony, or Iraqi insurgents

38:57.444 --> 39:00.723
would ever have formed a stable
democracy, or Isis would ever

39:00.724 --> 39:04.043
form a state with which the world
could have diplomatic relations.

39:04.044 --> 39:08.163
And, Andrew, I certainly do not miss
the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.

39:08.164 --> 39:10.523
So what are the lessons to be learned?

39:10.524 --> 39:13.483
The Prime Minister has been
very clear on how we deal

39:13.484 --> 39:15.963
with the present
and build a more secure future.

39:15.964 --> 39:19.403
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

39:19.404 --> 39:23.243
I can't see any justification
for believing the Taliban would

39:23.244 --> 39:26.843
govern Afghanistan in peace and
harmony, or Iraqi insurgents would

39:26.844 --> 39:29.484
ever have formed a stable democracy or...

39:31.004 --> 39:32.683
...and build a more secure future.

39:32.684 --> 39:36.500
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

39:37.004 --> 39:39.764
...doesn't require
apologising for the past.

39:41.284 --> 39:44.564
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

39:45.964 --> 39:49.683
...doesn't require
apologising for the past.

39:49.684 --> 39:53.963
...apologising for the past.
..apologising for the past.

39:53.964 --> 39:55.483
...apologising for the past.

39:55.484 --> 39:58.363
...apologising for the past.
..apologising for the past.

39:58.364 --> 40:01.884
..apologising for the
past... apologising for the past.

40:07.324 --> 40:11.163
Hello. Reception. Where? Yes, here he is.

40:11.164 --> 40:13.927
Security, they need you upstairs! Quick!

40:18.164 --> 40:19.620
Clear back!

40:42.444 --> 40:43.963
How can you treat me like that?

40:43.964 --> 40:45.763
You have had it in for me from day one!

40:45.764 --> 40:48.323
- Oh, stand there like a smug prat!
- Sergeant Budd, thank you.

40:48.324 --> 40:51.363
Sergeant Budd, would you kindly
escort Ms Dyson from the building

40:51.364 --> 40:54.442
and we can all get back to work?
Thank you.

40:54.443 --> 40:56.843
...for a job that you don't even
know what I do on a daily basis.

40:56.844 --> 41:00.181
Have you taken the time? No.
Because you are that arrogant.

41:00.182 --> 41:02.683
- Get back in your office! Narcissist!
- There's a cab coming for her.

41:02.684 --> 41:04.545
Oh, a cab! Keep your cab.

41:04.570 --> 41:05.944
- You narcissistic, smug prick.
- Sorry.

41:05.945 --> 41:07.883
Good luck with your interview, darling!

41:07.884 --> 41:10.163
I wouldn't work here if I'm fucking paid.

41:10.164 --> 41:13.048
- Miss, will you come with me, please?
- No.

41:14.964 --> 41:18.180
Come on. Let's talk about it
downstairs. All right?

41:31.284 --> 41:33.700
Can you not stand so close to me, please?

41:35.644 --> 41:38.803
Yeah, I'm just coming out
onto the street now.

41:38.804 --> 41:39.940
Thanks.

41:40.484 --> 41:42.123
Bit calmer?

41:42.124 --> 41:43.563
If you don't want to deal with them,

41:43.564 --> 41:46.203
I can sort out sending on your
personal belongings.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.700
Thank you.

41:48.204 --> 41:49.723
What happened?

41:49.724 --> 41:52.643
They've started interviewing
candidates for my job.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.843
Didn't even tell me they were
giving me the push. So...

41:54.844 --> 41:56.363
They didn't say why?

41:56.364 --> 41:59.363
There's no "they".
It's just her. Sociopath.

41:59.364 --> 42:01.281
God help anyone who sees through her.

42:01.282 --> 42:02.914
I thought they were sending you a cab.

42:02.915 --> 42:05.124
Yeah. I don't need their shitty cab.

42:22.964 --> 42:25.087
Sierra Zulu 7-9, Lavender inbound.

42:25.088 --> 42:27.363
This is a breakdown of the
additional powers sought by RIPA-18.

42:27.364 --> 42:29.243
Mind if I steal your boss
for a minute, Rob?

42:29.244 --> 42:31.708
Uh, sure. See you inside.

42:31.709 --> 42:34.084
Interesting TV interview.
You must be very proud.

42:34.085 --> 42:36.606
I'd like to get into the Chamber
if that's all right with you, Roger.

42:36.607 --> 42:38.483
Planning to hijack the
counter-terror debate for a bit more

42:38.484 --> 42:41.163
- shameless self-promotion?
- Is there a point to this conversation?

42:41.164 --> 42:43.471
- Why aren't you returning my calls?
- Pardon me, ma'am,

42:43.472 --> 42:45.483
for security reasons,
I'd prefer if you moved indoors.

42:45.484 --> 42:47.243
You work for us, Plod,
so wind your neck in.

42:47.244 --> 42:49.643
I'm the fucking Chief Whip
and when I call, you answer.

42:49.644 --> 42:52.123
We claim the centre ground
but you're heading off-piste.

42:52.124 --> 42:54.470
The PM can count on my full support.

42:54.471 --> 42:57.603
Bullshit. He's weakened. You're making
a move for the leadership.

42:57.604 --> 42:59.883
Sir, ma'am, I really do
need you both to move inside.

42:59.884 --> 43:02.844
Can't you call your monkey off?
Throw him some nuts.

43:03.144 --> 43:04.584
I'm mixed-race.

43:15.804 --> 43:17.763
- Hi.
- John. Roger Penhaligon.

43:17.764 --> 43:19.643
- You OK?
- No. Not great.

43:19.644 --> 43:23.243
I need to record my side of
a conversation with one of the PPOs.

43:23.244 --> 43:26.163
Are you? Biracial?

43:26.164 --> 43:27.460
No, ma'am.

43:29.564 --> 43:31.683
Right, where were we?

43:31.684 --> 43:33.283
Right. This is a summary

43:33.284 --> 43:36.484
of the limitations
in existing legislation...

43:53.284 --> 43:54.564
All clear, ma'am.

43:59.577 --> 44:00.737
Sergeant Budd.

44:11.044 --> 44:12.460
Your shirt.

44:13.284 --> 44:14.860
Thank you, ma'am.

44:15.244 --> 44:19.043
I'm sorry about Chanel. She took
her dismissal badly and my staff

44:19.044 --> 44:21.924
thought you'd be the best
person to deal with it.

44:22.300 --> 44:24.444
If you can talk someone out of
blowing up a train...

44:30.604 --> 44:31.843
Want one?

44:31.844 --> 44:33.443
On duty, ma'am.

44:33.444 --> 44:35.243
Soft drinks in the fridge.

44:35.244 --> 44:37.100
No... thank you, ma'am.

44:37.964 --> 44:39.923
Do you prefer David or Dave?

44:39.924 --> 44:41.244
I answer to both, ma'am.

44:47.364 --> 44:49.342
You won't have heard yet

44:49.343 --> 44:52.323
but we are going to charge
the male 1st of October attacker.

44:52.324 --> 44:55.483
He appears to have plausible links
to Islamist terrorists,

44:55.484 --> 44:58.083
though I'm not at liberty
to say more at this stage.

44:58.084 --> 44:59.723
That's good news. Thanks, ma'am.

44:59.724 --> 45:03.803
And thanks to you, his wife's alive
to assist with our inquiries.

45:03.804 --> 45:06.883
It seems I'm constantly finding
reasons to compliment you.

45:06.884 --> 45:08.740
Not quite constantly.

45:11.724 --> 45:13.500
Is there a Mrs Budd?

45:13.804 --> 45:16.563
Yes, ma'am. Vicky. We have two children.

45:16.564 --> 45:17.780
What are their names?

45:18.284 --> 45:20.060
Ella and Charlie.

45:21.484 --> 45:24.220
Your shifts must make
home life difficult.

45:26.964 --> 45:28.883
I'm sorry. That was private.
I shouldn't have.

45:28.884 --> 45:33.340
No, it's... You'd know, ma'am,
all these hours you work.

45:34.671 --> 45:36.631
Goes with the territory.

45:38.564 --> 45:40.660
Did you always want to be a politician?

45:41.124 --> 45:42.900
I hope you don't mind me asking that.

45:44.004 --> 45:46.163
I was a criminal barrister.

45:46.164 --> 45:49.403
I witnessed at first hand how
the causes of crime often

45:49.404 --> 45:53.963
have as much to do with a person's
upbringing and social circumstances.

45:53.964 --> 45:56.804
I sought a role in which
I could make a real difference.

46:01.764 --> 46:02.924
I'm keeping you.

46:05.857 --> 46:07.260
May I ask, ma'am...

46:08.900 --> 46:11.940
...that interview you did on telly,
did you mean what you said?

46:13.780 --> 46:15.244
I'm sorry?

46:15.584 --> 46:17.304
About the Middle East.

46:19.364 --> 46:22.460
See, I don't say only what
the people want to hear.

46:23.084 --> 46:27.300
I'm about doing the right thing
and making the hard choices.

46:27.924 --> 46:31.524
The thing is, David/Dave,
I don't need you to vote for me,

46:31.750 --> 46:33.190
only to protect me.

46:36.124 --> 46:37.524
Rest assured, ma'am.

46:37.698 --> 46:39.298
I'll do what's required.

46:45.184 --> 46:46.624
Ma'am.

47:02.284 --> 47:03.324
Skipper.

48:05.764 --> 48:08.923
Sorry, I was just getting ready for work.

48:08.924 --> 48:11.820
I just wanted to apologise for
the other night.

48:13.097 --> 48:14.300
OK.

48:16.204 --> 48:18.923
I was just having a couple of rounds
of toast but I can make you some.

48:18.924 --> 48:20.644
You're all right, love. I'm fine.

48:21.844 --> 48:23.164
The kids not up yet?

48:25.324 --> 48:27.404
They're all right, aren't they?

48:27.884 --> 48:29.084
Sleepover.

48:30.180 --> 48:31.603
Both of them?

48:31.604 --> 48:35.660
RIPA-18 will give them that support.

48:36.784 --> 48:38.304
Vic?

48:40.204 --> 48:42.163
Look, don't take this the wrong way.

48:42.164 --> 48:45.403
I know you're disappointed
to miss the kids, but...

48:45.404 --> 48:47.363
...maybe that's why it's best
that you call ahead

48:47.364 --> 48:48.724
if you're going to come round.

48:54.624 --> 48:56.184
I was hoping we could talk.

48:57.964 --> 49:00.243
- Why?
- I've said I'm sorry.

49:00.244 --> 49:01.604
Yeah, you always are.

49:03.780 --> 49:05.283
You need help, Dave.

49:05.284 --> 49:07.923
I need a job that pays the bills, Vic.

49:07.924 --> 49:10.363
Yes. And I keep covering for you
so that you can keep it

49:10.364 --> 49:13.260
but I've stopped being able
to stand back and watch.

49:14.044 --> 49:15.443
You are getting worse, Dave.

49:15.444 --> 49:18.020
Love, I'm sorry,
but we can work through this.

49:21.111 --> 49:22.671
I've met someone.

49:27.844 --> 49:28.884
He was here?

49:30.737 --> 49:31.777
Overnight?

49:33.204 --> 49:34.364
Yes.

49:36.084 --> 49:38.043
- Still here?
- No.

49:38.044 --> 49:40.923
Look, I... I was going to tell you.

49:40.924 --> 49:43.723
You farm our kids out so you can
have your night together?

49:43.724 --> 49:46.843
They're with their school friends.
They've had a lovely time.

49:46.844 --> 49:48.043
Do they know?

49:48.044 --> 49:49.643
They think that he's a friend.

49:49.644 --> 49:50.684
Oh.

49:52.604 --> 49:53.884
Dave...

50:01.610 --> 50:02.850
Dave?

50:05.364 --> 50:07.163
Let's not get divorced yet.

50:07.164 --> 50:11.300
Oh, God, no. We're not that serious
or anything. It's early days.

50:13.364 --> 50:15.324
In case anything happens to me at work...

50:16.451 --> 50:19.771
...you'll still get the pension
if we're legally married.

50:31.164 --> 50:33.843
That the Counter-Terrorism
and Security Act 2015

50:33.844 --> 50:36.580
simply does not go far enough.

50:37.724 --> 50:38.923
Hi. Chanel.

50:38.924 --> 50:40.580
Yeah, sorry.

50:41.604 --> 50:42.883
I hope here's OK.

50:42.884 --> 50:44.803
Oh, fine. Can I get you anything?

50:44.804 --> 50:47.164
- No, please, let me.
- Maybe later.

50:49.244 --> 50:52.057
Look, I know, but you
just always seemed open

50:52.058 --> 50:53.643
to the wider possibilities of a story,

50:53.644 --> 50:55.763
not one to regurgitate the press release.

50:55.764 --> 50:57.083
Thanks very much.

50:57.084 --> 50:58.963
And for getting in touch.

50:58.964 --> 51:00.763
Julia Montague's the woman of the hour,

51:00.764 --> 51:02.643
so my editor didn't take much persuading.

51:02.644 --> 51:05.363
"Woman of the hour."
Talk about an understatement.

51:05.364 --> 51:07.603
You weren't able to give me much
detail over the phone.

51:07.604 --> 51:09.580
Yeah, that's right. Well...

51:10.164 --> 51:12.563
...I just want to stop everyone
getting carried away

51:12.564 --> 51:15.083
with this idea that she's
such a brilliant politician.

51:15.084 --> 51:17.780
- How would you describe her?
- A sociopath.

51:19.060 --> 51:20.683
The most dangerous person in the country.

51:20.684 --> 51:22.003
More dangerous than the people

51:22.004 --> 51:23.883
that she keeps calling
enemies of freedom.

51:23.884 --> 51:26.643
- How's she dangerous?
- She's got an agenda.

51:26.644 --> 51:31.380
To heighten fear, to destroy
debate and to seize power.

51:32.044 --> 51:34.443
What evidence do you have to
substantiate these claims?

51:34.444 --> 51:36.683
I've worked for two years
in the Home Office,

51:36.684 --> 51:39.860
most of that time in daily contact
with Julia Montague.

51:41.857 --> 51:43.697
You were fired, Chanel.

51:45.084 --> 51:46.124
Yeah.

51:47.244 --> 51:49.163
In Whitehall, this isn't a story,

51:49.164 --> 51:51.803
"Aide gets fired.
Aide bad-mouths minister."

51:51.804 --> 51:54.388
I'm trying to explain
how Julia's different.

51:54.389 --> 51:56.083
But you're not explaining
how you're different

51:56.084 --> 51:58.300
from any other disgruntled
former employee.

51:58.964 --> 52:02.323
You've got my number and e-mail
if you find something concrete.

52:02.324 --> 52:04.084
I hope things work out for you.

52:23.724 --> 52:27.403
Are you getting in?
Do you want me to call someone?

52:27.404 --> 52:29.723
That's the last thing I want you to do.

52:29.724 --> 52:30.964
Open invitation.

52:58.644 --> 53:01.203
For decades, the West

53:01.204 --> 53:04.683
has been inflicting suffering
on the poor and powerless.

53:04.684 --> 53:08.660
The war in the desert, in the oil fields,

53:09.084 --> 53:12.443
we've brought it back
to the streets of Britain.

53:12.444 --> 53:14.723
There's kids growing up over here,

53:14.724 --> 53:19.083
all they hear is what's been done
to families and friends over there.

53:19.084 --> 53:22.980
Who can blame them
if they want to push back?

53:31.300 --> 53:32.763
And when they push back,

53:32.764 --> 53:36.404
our politicians act
like it's come from nowhere,

53:36.740 --> 53:39.363
so they can pass laws
restricting our freedoms

53:39.364 --> 53:42.523
and order new attacks against
the so-called terrorists,

53:42.524 --> 53:47.020
and guess what?
The cycle of violence goes on.

53:49.004 --> 53:51.900
Always wondered if
you'd turn up some time.

53:52.444 --> 53:54.620
Soapbox is not really my thing, mate.

53:55.084 --> 53:57.060
That's not how you were in Helmand.

53:57.644 --> 53:59.780
That was a crazy time out there.

54:00.164 --> 54:01.883
I'm trying to put all that behind me.

54:01.884 --> 54:04.020
I'm making a proper go of civvy street.

54:04.844 --> 54:10.140
Put PTSD on your job application,
who's going to hire you, right?

54:11.100 --> 54:12.820
Just because it's not visible...

54:17.660 --> 54:20.443
Mate, you can't beat it on your own.

54:20.444 --> 54:22.380
The counselling sessions,

54:23.084 --> 54:25.540
they're really helpful.

54:25.844 --> 54:29.084
- There's a bunch of us now, good...
- I'm good, thanks.

54:35.284 --> 54:37.444
So what are you doing now?

54:37.790 --> 54:38.830
Police.

54:41.444 --> 54:42.780
Doing what?

54:43.404 --> 54:44.683
Specialist protection.

54:44.684 --> 54:48.363
Government ministers.
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:48.364 --> 54:50.684
You're protecting those wankers?

54:51.060 --> 54:54.483
You turn up after all this time
and tell me this shit?

54:54.484 --> 54:57.820
What's that about?
You've got a fucking nerve, mate.

54:59.124 --> 55:01.900
- I knew you'd understand.
- Understand what?

55:02.804 --> 55:04.763
You said it out in Helmand.

55:04.764 --> 55:05.923
You say a lot of stuff

55:05.924 --> 55:08.180
when you've seen your
best mates blown to pieces.

55:09.740 --> 55:12.323
That if you ever found yourself
right beside one of those bastards

55:12.324 --> 55:13.603
that sent us out there,

55:13.604 --> 55:15.964
you'd just close your eyes
and pull the trigger.

55:17.564 --> 55:19.243
You'd still have a face.

55:19.244 --> 55:20.884
I'd still have a family.

56:04.564 --> 56:06.164
Doors and seat belts.

56:09.444 --> 56:10.803
Little bird told me

56:10.804 --> 56:13.420
you were Johnny on the spot
at the 1st of October?

56:14.324 --> 56:15.763
Yes, sir.

56:15.764 --> 56:18.884
Looks like the Home Secretary
couldn't be in safer hands.

56:34.684 --> 56:36.364
Lavender outbound.

56:37.305 --> 56:43.405
