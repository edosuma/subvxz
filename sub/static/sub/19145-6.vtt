WEBVTT

00:01.317 --> 00:03.292
Previously on Cardinal...

00:03.293 --> 00:04.453
It's just a normal day.

00:04.454 --> 00:05.107
You go to work,

00:05.108 --> 00:05.984
get the drugs.

00:05.985 --> 00:07.485
I'll get the new place set up.

00:07.820 --> 00:09.420
Edie. What's going on?

00:09.421 --> 00:10.764
We're trying to have a kid.

00:10.765 --> 00:12.624
The joke's on me because I found these.

00:12.625 --> 00:14.292
If this isn't something that you want,

00:14.293 --> 00:15.693
you need to say so.

00:15.693 --> 00:17.162
He got a cop killed.

00:17.163 --> 00:18.663
He tipped them off, Delorme,

00:18.664 --> 00:19.831
and he erased the evidence.

00:19.832 --> 00:21.366
That's the kind of secret

00:21.367 --> 00:22.834
that you pay to keep quiet.

00:22.835 --> 00:24.418
You walk out of here with that

00:24.419 --> 00:25.837
I never want to see you again.

00:25.838 --> 00:27.821
You find out who this guy is paying off,

00:27.822 --> 00:28.907
we got him.

00:28.908 --> 00:30.811
Whatever you think you're looking for,

00:30.812 --> 00:31.943
there's nothing to find.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.511
So we need a vacant space

00:33.512 --> 00:34.946
while Eric was working for them.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.214
There can't be that many.

00:37.449 --> 00:38.749
[Gunshots}

00:40.886 --> 00:42.186
Where's Keith?

00:44.990 --> 00:46.573
There's no sign of Keith London.

00:46.574 --> 00:48.693
We're looking for a body, aren't we?

00:48.694 --> 00:49.861
They got Eric.

00:49.862 --> 00:51.205
You don't have to do this.

00:51.206 --> 00:52.506
You can let me go.

00:53.065 --> 00:54.365
I can't.

00:54.967 --> 00:57.969
- Ugh.
- Ah!

01:53.626 --> 01:55.756
The tools we found at the school

01:55.757 --> 01:57.257
had your son's blood on them.

01:58.826 --> 02:00.446
But we are continuing our search.

02:00.895 --> 02:03.397
I have volunteers
coming in from Sudbury,

02:03.398 --> 02:05.165
and dog teams are arriving this morning

02:05.166 --> 02:06.166
from Toronto.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.827
But it's too late.

02:08.303 --> 02:10.043
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

02:11.606 --> 02:12.906
Keith is gone.

02:13.946 --> 02:15.409
You are gonna have to prepare

02:15.410 --> 02:16.677
for that possibility.

02:35.430 --> 02:36.653
I'm Detective Delorme

02:36.654 --> 02:38.155
with the Algonquin Bay Police.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.267
I'm gonna need your guest list

02:40.268 --> 02:42.436
and security footage for the past week.

02:51.446 --> 02:52.946
Did they take your gun?

02:54.215 --> 02:56.216
Ah, a man died.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.784
There's procedures.

02:57.785 --> 03:00.053
He was a serial killer.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.354
You did your job.

03:02.156 --> 03:03.456
They know that.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.159
They should be giving you an award,

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
not a grilling.

03:07.161 --> 03:08.461
Well,

03:08.696 --> 03:10.864
it will be over soon

03:10.865 --> 03:12.799
and then we can go see Mom.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.580
I told her I was coming this morning.

03:16.471 --> 03:17.971
I'll just take a cab over.

03:22.910 --> 03:25.211
You need to let me be
a part of this, Dad.

03:29.384 --> 03:31.318
Can I ask you something?

03:31.319 --> 03:33.219
And I want you to be honest with me.

03:43.064 --> 03:45.198
Is there a dead raccoon in your freezer?

03:51.672 --> 03:54.012
How would you describe your
frame of mind yesterday?

03:55.176 --> 03:56.476
Focused.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.413
Nothing preoccupying you?

03:59.414 --> 04:02.015
Nothing causing you
undue stress or agitation?

04:02.016 --> 04:03.316
I was fine.

04:03.551 --> 04:04.551
Fit for duty.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.908
And how do you feel today?

04:16.430 --> 04:20.233
Today's the day after
we lost another kid.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.202
But you caught the killer.

04:22.203 --> 04:23.983
That must be a source of some relief.

04:29.043 --> 04:30.946
Detective, you were
involved in another incident

04:30.947 --> 04:33.413
that SIU looked at four years ago.

04:33.414 --> 04:34.714
That's right.

04:35.283 --> 04:36.728
A drug raid in Toronto.

04:36.729 --> 04:38.552
What does that have to do with this?

04:38.553 --> 04:40.136
I see that after the incident

04:40.137 --> 04:41.637
you requested some time off,

04:42.824 --> 04:44.364
citing, uh, the emotional toll.

04:45.293 --> 04:46.693
An officer died.

04:46.694 --> 04:47.994
Of course.

04:48.529 --> 04:49.563
And shortly after,

04:49.564 --> 04:51.298
you transferred out
of Toronto back here.

04:51.299 --> 04:52.532
Is that right?

04:52.533 --> 04:55.635
Only after answering
a thousand questions,

04:55.636 --> 04:57.170
all of them on the record.

04:58.139 --> 04:59.139
I understand

04:59.140 --> 05:00.680
and we don't have to rehash it.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.510
We seem to be.

05:05.613 --> 05:08.882
Paul, um, can you run
this plate for me, please?

05:08.883 --> 05:10.183
Detective,

05:12.086 --> 05:13.954
an event like you
went through yesterday,

05:13.955 --> 05:15.255
something that violent,

05:15.890 --> 05:19.459
it can call up trauma
from past experiences.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.963
Are you aware of the support services

05:20.964 --> 05:22.562
available to you?

05:22.563 --> 05:23.563
I am.

05:23.564 --> 05:25.298
Because these things,

05:25.299 --> 05:26.599
they stay with you.

05:29.637 --> 05:30.937
Lidstrom?

05:31.506 --> 05:32.639
Got it.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.940
Thanks.

05:52.693 --> 05:53.993
I got you, John.

06:23.024 --> 06:24.324
Open the door.

06:26.294 --> 06:27.294
Gran, my hands are full.

06:27.295 --> 06:28.828
Do you want your steam or not?

06:31.032 --> 06:32.552
...police have identified the deceased

06:32.576 --> 06:34.834
as 28-year-old Eric Fraser.

06:34.835 --> 06:37.837
Fraser is alleged to
have committed two murders

06:37.838 --> 06:39.406
in the Algonquin Bay area

06:39.407 --> 06:41.641
and may be connected to more.

06:41.642 --> 06:42.809
The Coroner's service

06:42.810 --> 06:45.679
is working to locate next-of-kin.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.703
Police confronted Fraser
at the abandoned school...

06:47.704 --> 06:49.416
Did you-did you know?

06:54.922 --> 06:55.922
Edie.

07:11.939 --> 07:13.473
Can I have a word?

07:13.908 --> 07:15.208
Yeah, sure.

07:17.044 --> 07:18.612
You're thinking about the meds, right?

07:18.613 --> 07:20.146
From Todd Curry's toxicology?

07:21.182 --> 07:22.182
What about them?

07:22.183 --> 07:23.183
Prescription stuff.

07:23.184 --> 07:24.184
Rare.

07:24.185 --> 07:25.185
Where does Eric Fraser

07:25.186 --> 07:26.686
get his hands on that?

07:26.687 --> 07:27.687
Internet?

07:27.688 --> 07:28.688
Maybe,

07:28.689 --> 07:29.689
but why the cocktail?

07:29.690 --> 07:30.690
Why not just a

07:30.691 --> 07:31.791
simple tranquilizer

07:31.792 --> 07:33.092
and be done with it?

07:33.294 --> 07:34.628
Because he's not a doctor,

07:34.629 --> 07:35.929
he doesn't know any better.

07:35.930 --> 07:36.930
What are you saying?

07:36.931 --> 07:38.064
I'm not saying anything.

07:38.065 --> 07:39.399
I'm asking.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.700
Are we missing a piece?

07:55.549 --> 07:58.885
You're being investigated
for corruption.

07:58.886 --> 08:01.154
That's why I was transferred to CIS.

08:05.159 --> 08:06.459
I told you,

08:07.228 --> 08:08.528
there's nothing to find.

08:10.424 --> 08:11.727
Yesterday a woman named

08:11.728 --> 08:14.300
Tammy Lidstrom visited you.

08:14.301 --> 08:16.602
She's the ex-girlfriend of Delroy Moss.

08:19.106 --> 08:20.926
Delroy was your inside guy in Toronto.

08:22.643 --> 08:24.223
He connects you to Kyle Corbett.

08:26.614 --> 08:28.314
I was investigating Kyle Corbett.

08:30.317 --> 08:31.617
That's no secret.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.187
Lidstrom visits regularly.

08:34.188 --> 08:36.121
She stays at the Chateau Guay Motel

08:36.123 --> 08:37.423
under a false name.

08:38.359 --> 08:39.659
You pay her, John,

08:39.927 --> 08:42.028
secret payments in cash.

08:42.029 --> 08:45.665
Money that you launder
through Thunderbird Casino.

08:45.666 --> 08:47.634
You tipped off Corbett's people.

08:47.635 --> 08:48.635
As a result,

08:48.636 --> 08:49.936
an officer died.

08:51.338 --> 08:52.872
You pay Lidstrom

08:52.873 --> 08:54.407
to stay quiet about it.

08:57.878 --> 08:59.612
So why are you telling me?

09:01.148 --> 09:02.448
Why not just

09:02.983 --> 09:04.283
file your report?

09:11.358 --> 09:12.859
Because I want to understand.

09:15.129 --> 09:16.429
You won't.

09:20.501 --> 09:22.404
Tell me you didn't know
they'd leave explosives.

09:22.405 --> 09:25.205
Tell me you didn't know
an officer would die.

09:25.206 --> 09:26.506
Tell me that much.

09:29.577 --> 09:31.357
It sounds like you have your answers.

09:39.487 --> 09:40.787
Why?

09:44.925 --> 09:46.225
Money.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.666
Do what you have to do,

09:56.537 --> 09:58.938
but let me tell Dorothy Pine

09:58.939 --> 10:00.279
that we caught the killer.

10:11.452 --> 10:13.386
I'm filing my report this afternoon.

10:17.625 --> 10:18.626
You have until then.

10:44.981 --> 10:46.281
His name was

10:46.349 --> 10:47.649
Eric Fraser,

10:48.451 --> 10:49.751
28 years old,

10:52.622 --> 10:54.122
and he won't be harming anyone

10:55.525 --> 10:56.825
anymore.

11:01.664 --> 11:02.964
Fraser worked

11:05.101 --> 11:06.401
at the store

11:06.869 --> 11:08.569
where we believe Katie bought this.

11:10.773 --> 11:12.073
That's where he saw her?

11:12.775 --> 11:14.075
Possibly.

11:16.212 --> 11:18.346
I didn't know if you'd
want it back or not.

11:33.296 --> 11:34.596
In the coming days,

11:35.398 --> 11:36.818
you'll hear things about me,

11:38.367 --> 11:39.667
mistakes I made.

11:45.141 --> 11:46.641
But I want you to know,

11:48.978 --> 11:50.278
with Katie,

11:53.749 --> 11:55.483
I did everything I knew how to do.

12:09.031 --> 12:10.331
Are you hungry?

12:11.601 --> 12:12.934
People keep bringing me food.

12:32.755 --> 12:34.422
I just wanted to let you know

12:34.423 --> 12:36.358
I've completed my investigation.

12:36.359 --> 12:37.526
I'm submitting my report

12:37.527 --> 12:39.427
to Sergeant Musgrave this afternoon.

12:40.763 --> 12:42.063
Are you okay?

12:43.366 --> 12:44.666
In Financial you

12:45.735 --> 12:48.270
find someone who broke the law.

12:48.271 --> 12:49.571
You do the math.

12:49.572 --> 12:50.772
You nail him.

12:50.773 --> 12:52.073
Black and white.

12:52.759 --> 12:53.942
The task you have been given,

12:53.943 --> 12:55.443
you're gonna have doubts.

13:00.449 --> 13:01.749
Six months ago,

13:02.285 --> 13:04.586
I called off the search for Katie Pine.

13:06.656 --> 13:07.956
I followed the rules.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.332
I did what I thought was right.

13:15.525 --> 13:16.748
Sometimes that's the only part

13:16.749 --> 13:18.249
you get to be sure about.

13:23.072 --> 13:24.739
So here's what you do.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.341
If you're, uh, McLeod,

13:26.342 --> 13:28.009
you go home, you kiss your wife,

13:28.010 --> 13:29.310
you have a beer.

13:31.581 --> 13:32.981
And if you're Cardinal,

13:32.982 --> 13:35.083
you keep chewing on it

13:35.084 --> 13:36.384
until you're in pieces.

13:38.187 --> 13:39.487
The doubts you have,

13:40.122 --> 13:41.623
can you live with them or not?

13:46.429 --> 13:47.529
Hey.

13:47.530 --> 13:48.830
Josh, right?

13:48.965 --> 13:50.198
Yeah. Hi.

13:50.199 --> 13:51.499
Um, is Lise here?

13:51.500 --> 13:52.880
I was in the neighbourhood.

13:53.436 --> 13:54.736
I think she just left.

13:55.671 --> 13:57.291
You can probably still catch her.

13:59.442 --> 14:00.942
Ah. I'll give her a call.

14:02.278 --> 14:03.621
You must be proud of her.

14:03.622 --> 14:04.779
She's done really well here.

14:04.780 --> 14:06.281
Yeah. I'm-I'm a lucky guy.

14:21.063 --> 14:22.326
I'll catch up with her tonight.

14:22.327 --> 14:23.331
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:23.332 --> 14:24.632
- Good to see ya.
- Yeah.

14:27.570 --> 14:30.038
No, no, it's-it's in the freezer,

14:30.039 --> 14:31.419
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

14:32.241 --> 14:33.541
What on earth for?

14:34.577 --> 14:35.877
I don't know. He...

14:36.679 --> 14:39.213
he found it and didn't
want to put it in the trash?

14:40.650 --> 14:41.983
He hates raccoons.

14:41.984 --> 14:43.284
Not this one.

14:44.153 --> 14:46.287
I said I was gonna
throw it in the woods.

14:48.424 --> 14:49.958
You should have seen his face.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.233
You know, he didn't
want me to come here.

15:01.704 --> 15:03.324
He doesn't think I can handle it.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.343
It's me he's trying to protect.

15:54.090 --> 15:56.758
John, you know you're
not supposed to be here.

15:56.759 --> 15:57.759
Go home.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.060
I'm not staying.

15:59.562 --> 16:01.062
Let SIU do their thing.

16:07.570 --> 16:09.304
I just wanted to say thanks.

16:09.305 --> 16:10.885
You're good at your job, Noelle.

16:13.008 --> 16:15.143
You don't need me to
tell you that but...

16:16.979 --> 16:18.681
Is this the

16:18.748 --> 16:20.654
stuff from Eric's van?

16:21.842 --> 16:23.008
The guitar wasn't in there.

16:23.009 --> 16:24.510
It wasn't at his house either.

16:24.878 --> 16:26.378
That never bother you?

16:27.681 --> 16:28.981
Maybe he sold it?

16:29.716 --> 16:31.336
The bag from Southridge Pharmacy.

16:34.187 --> 16:35.754
It's a shopping bag.

16:35.755 --> 16:37.055
Empty.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.424
Along with about two hundred other items

16:40.727 --> 16:42.267
and they're not going anywhere.

16:46.433 --> 16:47.933
It's time to clock out, John.

16:50.871 --> 16:52.171
I know it's hard.

16:57.611 --> 16:58.911
Go home.

16:59.479 --> 17:00.779
Get some rest.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.351
Yeah.

17:07.220 --> 17:08.220
I'll do that.

17:29.576 --> 17:32.111
You had any medicine
go missing recently?

17:32.112 --> 17:33.779
An officer came by a couple days ago.

17:33.780 --> 17:34.780
We checked.

17:34.781 --> 17:36.121
There was nothing missing.

17:39.152 --> 17:40.352
Triazolam.

17:40.353 --> 17:41.353
You have that?

17:41.354 --> 17:42.354
Of course.

17:42.355 --> 17:43.655
I'd like to check again.

17:56.970 --> 17:58.470
Okay, three bottles,

17:59.940 --> 18:01.607
just as there's supposed to be.

18:01.608 --> 18:02.608
And you take meds

18:02.609 --> 18:04.677
directly from here
to fill prescriptions?

18:04.678 --> 18:05.811
Yeah, that's right,

18:05.812 --> 18:07.512
and then we record it all.

18:08.982 --> 18:09.982
Let's count 'em.

18:09.983 --> 18:11.283
What? All of them?

18:11.818 --> 18:13.118
Let's count all of them.

18:13.653 --> 18:14.853
211...

18:14.854 --> 18:15.854
212...

18:15.855 --> 18:17.155
213.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.030
Check that with the inventory.

18:31.805 --> 18:33.405
What? What is it?

18:33.406 --> 18:34.940
It's supposed to be 218 but

18:35.041 --> 18:36.541
there's five missing.

18:36.860 --> 18:38.243
How would a customer get back here

18:38.244 --> 18:39.775
without you noticing?

18:39.776 --> 18:41.957
It wasn't a customer.
It was an employee.

18:41.958 --> 18:44.295
- Why do you say that?
- Because I saw her.

18:44.848 --> 18:46.485
Edie Soames.

20:02.757 --> 20:04.057
Hey.

20:07.295 --> 20:09.029
So John's not coming.

20:09.030 --> 20:10.530
I'm the one who texted you.

20:11.699 --> 20:13.079
I'm Detective Lise Delorme,

20:13.935 --> 20:15.369
Algonquin Bay Police.

20:15.370 --> 20:17.371
I got your number from
the Chateau Guay Motel.

20:17.372 --> 20:18.872
I don't like being ambushed.

20:20.775 --> 20:23.076
Tammy, what I'm about to
tell you is confidential.

20:23.077 --> 20:25.145
So if you repeat any of it,

20:25.146 --> 20:27.280
you'll be charged with
obstruction of justice.

20:28.283 --> 20:29.583
You understand?

20:30.084 --> 20:31.384
I guess.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.621
You're keeping that purse awfully close.

20:36.925 --> 20:39.059
Anything in there I
should be worried about?

20:40.228 --> 20:41.562
What do you take me for?

20:41.563 --> 20:42.863
I don't know you.

20:50.338 --> 20:51.939
I'm investigating John Cardinal

20:51.940 --> 20:53.574
on charges of corruption.

20:53.575 --> 20:55.976
I need you to corroborate
some information.

20:55.977 --> 20:57.945
I know Cardinal tipped off Corbett.

20:57.946 --> 20:59.366
I know you're extorting him.

21:00.815 --> 21:02.449
So describe to me,

21:02.450 --> 21:04.751
what's your relationship with Cardinal?

21:04.752 --> 21:06.052
Top tier.

21:08.189 --> 21:09.189
How much money

21:09.190 --> 21:10.770
did he get for alerting Corbett?

21:11.659 --> 21:13.427
You're-you're bouncing around here.

21:13.428 --> 21:15.429
No. No, I'm not.

21:15.430 --> 21:17.030
No, it's all the same question.

21:17.031 --> 21:18.331
Why would he do it?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.868
His job was to befriend
you, to stay close.

21:21.869 --> 21:24.004
Maybe he wasn't doing
it for the money at all.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.641
Maybe he wanted to protect you.

21:27.642 --> 21:29.502
You think Cardinal and I had an affair?

21:30.378 --> 21:31.511
I don't know.

21:31.512 --> 21:32.879
All that time together,

21:32.880 --> 21:34.180
the lines get blurred.

21:34.849 --> 21:36.149
And what about Catherine?

21:36.351 --> 21:38.011
Was he blurry on that subject too?

21:38.886 --> 21:41.321
You're grasping, Detective.

21:41.322 --> 21:43.062
Uh, how do you know about Catherine?

21:43.791 --> 21:45.292
How do you even know her name?

21:46.394 --> 21:48.328
Cardinal wouldn't

21:48.329 --> 21:49.663
expose his home life to you.

21:49.664 --> 21:52.399
Well, he must have let it slip.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.467
While undercover?

21:53.468 --> 21:54.468
No chance.

21:54.469 --> 21:55.769
Well, later then.

21:57.705 --> 21:58.888
While you were extorting him.

21:58.889 --> 22:00.189
Look, I don't remember.

22:01.409 --> 22:02.943
I got nothing more to say.

23:11.279 --> 23:13.262
Welcome to Divine Intervention.

23:13.263 --> 23:14.414
My first guest is certain

23:14.415 --> 23:17.317
that after she came
out at the age of 57,

23:17.318 --> 23:19.619
after having a family of her own,

23:19.620 --> 23:23.390
including children
and marriage to a man,

23:23.391 --> 23:25.559
she was utterly
ostracized from her family

23:25.560 --> 23:27.928
and it completely upended her life.

23:27.929 --> 23:30.464
She thinks she's the victim
of serious discrimination

23:30.465 --> 23:32.899
and it's leading to
trauma in new relationships

23:32.900 --> 23:34.968
that are created and then broken.

23:34.969 --> 23:36.169
Let's hear her story.

23:36.170 --> 23:38.772
I came out at the age of 57.

23:38.773 --> 23:40.440
I loved my husband...

24:13.207 --> 24:14.841
This is Detective John Cardinal.

24:14.842 --> 24:16.777
I have a DB at 212 Leighton

24:16.778 --> 24:17.944
in the basement.

24:17.945 --> 24:19.679
I need an IDENT team.

24:19.680 --> 24:20.781
I need units,

24:20.782 --> 24:22.682
and we need to lock this
entire property down.

24:22.683 --> 24:24.451
The whole place is hot.

24:24.452 --> 24:27.053
This has to do with
the Eric Fraser murders.

24:27.054 --> 24:28.455
I need you to put a BOLO out

24:28.456 --> 24:29.890
on an Edie Soames,

24:29.891 --> 24:31.825
S-O-A-M-E-S.

24:31.826 --> 24:34.060
If there's a car registered in her name,

24:34.061 --> 24:35.361
call me back.

24:35.663 --> 24:37.063
And check to see who else

24:37.064 --> 24:38.832
lives at this address, 212 Leighton.

24:39.867 --> 24:42.636
If there's a car in the owner's name,

24:42.637 --> 24:44.871
BOLO that too.

25:08.262 --> 25:09.485
Keith. Keith. Keith.

25:09.486 --> 25:11.020
Don't let her see me.

25:16.070 --> 25:18.204
Keith. Just stick with me, Keith.

25:20.208 --> 25:21.508
You'll be fine.

25:22.910 --> 25:24.210
Hold on.

25:27.515 --> 25:28.782
You'll be fine.

25:30.685 --> 25:31.751
You'll be fine.

25:31.752 --> 25:33.019
You'll be fine, son.

25:33.020 --> 25:34.221
You're gonna be fine.

25:34.222 --> 25:35.522
You'll be fine, son.

25:39.193 --> 25:40.933
You're gonna be fine, son.

25:41.462 --> 25:43.763
In you go. There you go.

25:43.764 --> 25:45.064
In you go.

25:47.969 --> 25:49.135
Call regional.

25:49.136 --> 25:51.204
Tell them I'm bringing
in a knifing victim.

25:51.205 --> 25:52.205
He's hypothermic.

25:52.206 --> 25:54.074
He'll need blood. I'm ten minutes out.

25:54.075 --> 25:55.742
Get your car outta there now!

25:55.743 --> 25:57.043
Yes, sir!

26:07.255 --> 26:08.555
Can I help you?

26:08.990 --> 26:12.125
I-I'm looking for Detective Cardinal.

26:12.727 --> 26:14.027
He's not here right now.

26:15.129 --> 26:16.629
I can pass along a message.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.634
Ah, he's been helping me.

26:22.937 --> 26:24.504
Boyfriend problems.

26:24.505 --> 26:27.340
Um, I can give him a call if you want.

26:27.341 --> 26:28.742
It's okay.

26:28.743 --> 26:30.043
Don't bother him.

26:31.178 --> 26:32.445
Are you all right?

26:32.446 --> 26:33.947
It's the injury.

26:33.948 --> 26:34.948
It makes me dizzy.

26:34.949 --> 26:36.883
If I could just sit down for a minute?

26:37.752 --> 26:39.052
Uh...

26:39.820 --> 26:41.121
yeah of course.

26:41.122 --> 26:42.422
Come in.

26:58.479 --> 26:59.512
Here.

26:59.513 --> 27:00.813
Thank you.

27:09.590 --> 27:12.692
Are you Detective Cardinal's daughter?

27:12.693 --> 27:13.693
Yeah.

27:13.694 --> 27:14.994
Kelly.

27:15.496 --> 27:16.496
What's your name?

27:16.497 --> 27:17.797
I saw him on TV.

27:19.099 --> 27:21.668
Yeah. He's been in the news lately,

27:21.669 --> 27:22.969
unfortunately.

27:25.539 --> 27:27.039
Did he ask you to come by?

27:28.776 --> 27:30.009
No.

27:30.010 --> 27:32.278
But you've been here before?

27:32.279 --> 27:34.580
You're wondering how I got the address.

27:37.384 --> 27:38.885
I work at a pharmacy.

27:40.421 --> 27:41.721
He's in the system.

27:42.189 --> 27:43.489
Oh.

27:43.858 --> 27:45.158
Divalproex Sodium.

27:46.627 --> 27:47.927
That's what he got.

27:48.195 --> 27:49.462
It's a mood stabilizer.

27:49.463 --> 27:50.763
That'd be for my mom.

27:51.932 --> 27:53.766
But should you really
be talking about that?

27:53.767 --> 27:55.067
It's kind of private.

27:59.473 --> 28:01.641
Do you think he'll be long,

28:01.642 --> 28:02.642
your dad?

28:02.643 --> 28:05.044
Tell you what. Why don't I call him?

28:05.045 --> 28:06.308
I don't think you should.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.809
No, no, really. It's okay.

28:08.716 --> 28:10.116
I'll just give him a quick ring

28:10.117 --> 28:11.617
and see when he's coming home.

28:12.419 --> 28:13.719
Put it down.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.303
You've reached Detective John Cardinal.

28:27.304 --> 28:28.538
Please leave a message.

28:29.003 --> 28:30.236
Hey, it's me.

28:30.704 --> 28:32.104
I need to talk.

28:32.573 --> 28:35.074
John. Turn on your
phone. It's important.

29:01.335 --> 29:02.995
Anything on Edie Soames?

29:03.370 --> 29:04.904
DB was her grandmother.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.520
The BOLO's gone out and
roadblocks are in place.

29:12.279 --> 29:13.980
I should get back to the office.

29:13.981 --> 29:15.048
I have

29:15.049 --> 29:16.716
very clear instructions from Dyson,

29:16.717 --> 29:18.017
you're to go home.

29:18.485 --> 29:20.419
John, we'll find her.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.589
Go home. Pour yourself a drink.

29:24.191 --> 29:25.925
Save some glory for the rest of us.

30:10.671 --> 30:11.971
Hey.

30:16.677 --> 30:17.977
What?

30:18.846 --> 30:20.146
Oh.

30:20.615 --> 30:23.383
It's-it's not my blood.

30:35.863 --> 30:37.163
Edie.

30:38.699 --> 30:39.933
Edie Soames.

30:40.935 --> 30:42.068
Ugh.

30:42.069 --> 30:45.939
AH! AH! STOP!

30:45.940 --> 30:48.542
Argh.

30:52.380 --> 30:53.947
Do you have a gun?

30:56.284 --> 30:57.284
- No.
- Good.

30:58.286 --> 30:59.386
No!

30:59.387 --> 31:01.054
Stop it! Please!

31:01.055 --> 31:02.289
Stop it!

31:02.290 --> 31:03.323
Dad!

31:08.296 --> 31:09.596
Please.

31:11.799 --> 31:13.533
You took Eric from me.

31:14.335 --> 31:16.636
Now I'm gonna take something from you.

31:23.811 --> 31:24.811
Please. No. No.

31:27.648 --> 31:28.948
She's not...

31:29.517 --> 31:30.917
she's not part of this.

31:30.918 --> 31:32.218
Please.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.688
Look at me, Kelly.

31:34.689 --> 31:35.689
Please.

31:41.963 --> 31:43.096
Hey.

31:43.097 --> 31:44.597
No, you're not dismissed.

31:45.967 --> 31:48.168
You have to watch this.

31:55.343 --> 31:56.610
I'm gonna put a bullet

31:56.611 --> 31:57.634
in your daughter's brain.

31:57.635 --> 31:59.179
You have to watch.

32:01.482 --> 32:02.682
Hey!

32:02.683 --> 32:03.983
You have to watch!

32:04.518 --> 32:05.518
Ugh!

32:09.123 --> 32:10.423
Run, Kelly!

32:13.127 --> 32:16.429
Ugh! Ohhhh.

32:17.131 --> 32:18.431
Ah.

32:19.066 --> 32:20.366
Ugh.

32:38.719 --> 32:40.219
You don't have to do this

32:40.988 --> 32:42.288
for Eric.

32:46.827 --> 32:48.328
I'm not doing this for Eric.

32:52.900 --> 32:54.200
Then why?

32:56.504 --> 32:58.271
'Cause it feels good.

33:05.946 --> 33:07.246
John?

33:08.015 --> 33:09.315
John?

33:12.019 --> 33:13.319
John?

33:14.088 --> 33:15.555
It's okay.

33:15.556 --> 33:16.723
Look at me.

33:17.892 --> 33:19.259
It's okay.

33:25.866 --> 33:27.166
Oh, John.

33:27.468 --> 33:28.768
John.

33:28.869 --> 33:29.903
Call 911!

33:29.904 --> 33:32.038
Tell them an officer has been shot.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.240
John?

33:34.241 --> 33:35.541
Stay with me.

33:37.411 --> 33:39.412
Oh, no, you can't go anywhere.

33:39.413 --> 33:40.713
John!

33:43.884 --> 33:45.184
I know the truth.

33:46.087 --> 33:47.667
I know what happened in Toronto.

33:48.756 --> 33:50.056
I figured it out.

33:50.424 --> 33:51.724
I know the whole story.

33:57.965 --> 33:58.965
I know.

34:23.985 --> 34:25.284
Hey.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.659
What's that for?

34:33.862 --> 34:35.533
You saved my life.

34:37.166 --> 34:38.911
How's Kelly?

34:39.168 --> 34:41.118
Doing okay.

34:42.973 --> 34:44.474
She's a strong girl.

34:53.751 --> 34:56.286
Can I run something by you?

34:56.286 --> 34:57.587
Before I file my report.

34:59.256 --> 35:00.757
Whatever you have to do.

35:02.827 --> 35:04.327
I just want it to be over.

35:05.863 --> 35:07.163
Your call to Corbett.

35:09.700 --> 35:12.268
You wouldn't record
it and then erase it.

35:12.269 --> 35:13.569
It makes no sense.

35:14.505 --> 35:15.805
You'd talk in person.

35:16.807 --> 35:18.107
Leave no trace.

35:20.211 --> 35:21.511
It happened.

35:22.379 --> 35:23.679
You know it did.

35:26.684 --> 35:28.184
How much did he pay you?

35:29.286 --> 35:30.586
Enough.

35:31.622 --> 35:32.922
Criminal conspiracy.

35:34.391 --> 35:35.691
Obstruction of justice.

35:37.628 --> 35:39.128
What was it worth to you?

35:40.798 --> 35:42.098
Twenty grand?

35:42.700 --> 35:44.000
Fifty?

35:48.506 --> 35:50.673
You can't name a figure

35:50.674 --> 35:52.175
because there isn't one.

35:54.545 --> 35:56.045
You wouldn't do it for money.

35:57.414 --> 35:58.714
It's not who you are.

36:02.153 --> 36:03.520
But you'd do it for Catherine.

36:08.559 --> 36:10.860
She made the call, didn't she?

36:12.196 --> 36:13.496
No.

36:15.266 --> 36:16.566
She was manic.

36:17.101 --> 36:19.702
She got her hands on your burner phone,

36:19.703 --> 36:21.283
dialed the only number in there.

36:23.407 --> 36:24.707
She blew your cover.

36:25.943 --> 36:26.943
You're wrong.

36:26.944 --> 36:28.478
You found the recording later,

36:29.847 --> 36:31.347
after the raid went bad.

36:34.051 --> 36:35.351
You found it

36:35.920 --> 36:37.220
and you erased it.

36:38.756 --> 36:40.056
Someone has to pay.

36:41.692 --> 36:42.992
I understand that.

36:45.129 --> 36:46.429
But not her.

36:49.233 --> 36:50.733
She doesn't even remember

36:51.735 --> 36:53.035
making the call.

36:54.638 --> 36:55.872
She was confused,

36:55.873 --> 36:57.173
delusional.

36:59.043 --> 37:00.543
She called looking for me.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.547
She needed my help

37:04.548 --> 37:05.848
and I wasn't there.

37:09.386 --> 37:10.887
If she knew an officer died

37:12.423 --> 37:13.723
because of her,

37:16.727 --> 37:18.027
it would kill her.

37:20.130 --> 37:21.430
It's not your job

37:23.567 --> 37:25.067
to protect her from herself.

37:28.272 --> 37:29.572
Delorme,

37:31.475 --> 37:32.775
I need her.

37:37.248 --> 37:38.548
Tell them

37:39.116 --> 37:40.416
it was me.

37:56.767 --> 37:59.435
Ma'am, I just got back from Cardinal's.

37:59.436 --> 38:00.436
How's it look?

38:00.437 --> 38:04.274
Uh, IDENT guys told me to bring

38:04.275 --> 38:05.575
this in.

38:08.339 --> 38:09.522
What on earth is that?

38:09.523 --> 38:11.281
It's part of the crime.

38:11.282 --> 38:12.316
I didn't ask for details.

38:12.317 --> 38:14.180
They told me to put it
in the evidence freezer,

38:14.181 --> 38:16.281
said you'd give me the door code.

38:19.123 --> 38:20.943
There's no evidence freezer, is there?

38:22.793 --> 38:24.894
Get it off my desk, Constable.

38:24.895 --> 38:26.195
Mm hmm.

38:44.248 --> 38:46.868
All right. You called the
meeting, Delorme. Talk.

38:48.152 --> 38:49.452
Sir,

38:51.088 --> 38:52.388
Cardinal's not a rat.

38:54.191 --> 38:56.492
There's no connection
between him and Corbett.

38:56.493 --> 38:57.793
We're not done looking.

38:59.863 --> 39:01.531
If your unsanctioned investigation

39:01.532 --> 39:03.032
into Cardinal continues,

39:04.368 --> 39:05.668
I'll make it known.

39:09.673 --> 39:11.507
Sergeant, with respect,

39:11.508 --> 39:12.891
I know you're looking for a reason

39:12.892 --> 39:15.027
you haven't got Corbett all these years

39:15.713 --> 39:17.013
but it's not Cardinal.

39:18.849 --> 39:20.149
I'm sorry.

39:21.418 --> 39:23.552
You're sorry.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.090
You're sorry?

39:29.893 --> 39:31.394
Well that is

39:32.863 --> 39:34.163
amazing.

39:35.733 --> 39:37.033
Sir.

39:37.568 --> 39:39.869
You really want to make
an enemy of me right now?

39:42.072 --> 39:43.372
No.

39:45.743 --> 39:47.877
But you're wasting
your time with Cardinal

39:50.814 --> 39:54.735
and you need to back off.
