01:17.064 --> 01:18.650
<i>We're sorry. You have reached</i>

01:18.651 --> 01:20.362
<i>a number that has been disconnected.</i>

01:23.076 --> 01:25.204
Do you know anywhere
to stay around here?

01:25.205 --> 01:26.166
Sorry.

01:36.102 --> 01:38.775
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:40.486 --> 01:46.582
<i>Destiny? If this is you,
please come home. Hello!</i>

01:54.180 --> 01:56.392
I don't speak Spanish.

02:02.279 --> 02:03.489
Get off me!

02:06.454 --> 02:07.748
Get off me!

02:07.749 --> 02:09.585
Get off me!

02:09.586 --> 02:11.526
Get off me! Get off me!

02:20.149 --> 02:21.443
Are you okay?

02:22.863 --> 02:24.198
Come with us.

02:35.387 --> 02:37.056
Just come check it out.

02:37.057 --> 02:40.313
A hot meal, a shower,
a good night's sleep.

02:40.314 --> 02:42.484
Well, what is this, like, a cult?

02:42.485 --> 02:43.945
We don't use that word.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.033
And if it's not for you,
you can totally leave.

02:46.034 --> 02:48.413
No strings, I swear.

04:23.019 --> 04:26.024
Alex? Alex?

04:30.535 --> 04:32.663
Hey, Alex, it's breakfast.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.500
Your mom's been calling for you.

04:34.501 --> 04:35.962
Ah, I'm sorry.

04:43.894 --> 04:46.567
I haven't seen you play
this in a long while.

04:48.111 --> 04:49.698
It's what I used to play with her.

04:57.046 --> 05:00.217
Well, maybe I could step in.

05:00.218 --> 05:04.477
Ah, no offense, Dad, but she
was a lot better than you.

05:22.054 --> 05:25.644
- Mom's cooking.
- Don't sound so surprised.

05:25.645 --> 05:28.024
I made pancakes, your favorite.

05:29.318 --> 05:31.155
I'm good with juice. Thanks.

05:43.681 --> 05:47.478
Look, the special food,
being extra nice to me,

05:47.479 --> 05:49.023
you guys don't have to do all this.

05:49.024 --> 05:53.240
Alex, it's time.

05:53.241 --> 05:54.994
At first we gave you space.

05:54.995 --> 05:56.706
But two years?

05:56.707 --> 05:59.168
You spend all your time alone.

05:59.169 --> 06:01.507
I like hanging out with myself.

06:01.508 --> 06:03.218
Okay, how many people can say that?

06:03.219 --> 06:06.099
Plus, college isn't too far
into the future.

06:06.100 --> 06:09.105
I'll just... I'll make new friends then.

06:09.106 --> 06:12.028
The kids that know you
when you're young...

06:12.029 --> 06:14.282
no one will ever know you
like that again.

06:14.283 --> 06:15.744
Don't give up on that.

06:15.745 --> 06:17.079
- On them.
- Right.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.875
'Cause you've done such a great job

06:18.876 --> 06:20.588
keeping in touch with
your old friends from the 'hood.

06:24.345 --> 06:28.853
Well, I have a lot of things
I need to do today,

06:28.854 --> 06:30.565
like prepare for court,

06:30.566 --> 06:33.070
and the PRIDE meeting
we are hosting tonight.

06:33.071 --> 06:35.074
- Don't remind me.
- You guys do realize

06:35.075 --> 06:37.913
that it's a volunteer charity
organization, right, not the mob?

06:37.914 --> 06:39.541
Could get out if you wanted to.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.127
Maybe give some other rich people

06:41.128 --> 06:43.298
the opportunity for a tax write-off.

06:43.299 --> 06:45.219
This school we're building
is gonna do a lot of good

06:45.220 --> 06:47.306
for kids less fortunate than you.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.773
It's from your father's so-called 'hood.
I have to take this.

06:57.954 --> 06:59.999
Just think about it, all right?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.504
Those friends of yours
are probably feeling

07:02.505 --> 07:05.300
the exact same way you are today.

07:05.301 --> 07:08.683
Actually, they're doing just fine.

07:08.684 --> 07:12.607
Or maybe they're better at
hiding what's really going on.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.964
<i>♪ I know you ♪</i>

07:29.308 --> 07:34.568

08:01.247 --> 08:04.587
<i>The door to Amy's room was opened.</i>

08:20.076 --> 08:21.203
Tina, what's going on?

08:34.104 --> 08:36.734
- Mom.
- What are you doing in here?

08:36.735 --> 08:40.950
Borrowing some tights. Mine had a hole.

08:40.951 --> 08:42.871
I'm leaving.

08:42.871 --> 08:44.708
You know the rules.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.754
- If Amy was here, she'd let me...
- But Amy is not here.

08:46.755 --> 08:48.341
So what does it matter
if I take her tights?

08:54.687 --> 09:00.030
Mom... I'm sorry.

09:00.031 --> 09:02.953
I didn't mean to...

09:02.954 --> 09:04.581
It was an accident. I can fix it.

09:04.582 --> 09:05.626
Just go.

09:16.731 --> 09:18.108
Hey, kiddo, are you okay?

09:18.109 --> 09:20.362
What do you think?

09:38.734 --> 09:40.570
Breakfast ready.

09:40.571 --> 09:41.739
Is he in there?

09:41.740 --> 09:42.867
He is.

10:02.948 --> 10:04.534
Hey, Dad.

10:04.535 --> 10:08.041
Hi. Big win last night
against Harvard-Westlake.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.337
- Mm.
- Sorry you weren't there to see it.

10:10.338 --> 10:12.050
Me too, son. Heard you played great.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.306
Though I also heard...

10:17.310 --> 10:19.314
you got a "C" in Spanish.

10:20.693 --> 10:22.403
I'm definitely gonna try harder.

10:25.284 --> 10:27.623
If you were really afraid of me...

10:29.585 --> 10:31.463
you'd be getting an "A."

10:38.436 --> 10:39.731
Thank you.

10:44.156 --> 10:45.074
Thanks.

10:46.786 --> 10:51.252
It is the simplest gift you can give,

10:51.253 --> 10:55.261
and yet the most powerful...

10:57.015 --> 10:58.225
to let someone know...

10:59.687 --> 11:02.776
"Hey. I see you."

11:02.777 --> 11:06.575
And that power is yours to offer.

11:06.576 --> 11:10.750
Because that gift is a smile.

11:10.751 --> 11:15.342
Let us close by reading together
the words that my father,

11:15.343 --> 11:17.889
David Ellerh, first wrote.

11:17.890 --> 11:20.937
"Light fills a dark room."

11:20.938 --> 11:23.567
Look, I have to go.
Phil wants to meet up.

11:23.568 --> 11:24.986
Agent-actor check-in.

11:24.987 --> 11:26.532
If he wants to meet me in person,

11:26.533 --> 11:27.742
must be good news.

11:27.743 --> 11:30.623
- Okay. Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Dad.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.836
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Thank you.

11:32.837 --> 11:34.589
- Have a blessed day.
- Thanks.

11:34.590 --> 11:37.094
Oh, hey, sorry,
can I talk to you for a second?

11:37.095 --> 11:39.139
- Sure.
- I have to go to school,

11:39.140 --> 11:40.935
but I need you to sign this.

11:40.936 --> 11:43.691
It's a permission slip
for the trip to San Francisco,

11:43.692 --> 11:44.695
the Art Institute.

11:46.614 --> 11:49.076
- This is for tonight?
- Yeah.

11:49.077 --> 11:50.539
Honey, out of the question.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.382
The <i>Vanity Fair</i> article. The
writer's bringing a photographer.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.846
I need you to be there.

11:58.847 --> 12:00.933
You're the millennial face
of the church.

12:00.934 --> 12:03.062
Yeah, but can't I do it another time?

12:03.063 --> 12:05.191
Just this once? I mean,
you didn't even ask me.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.237
It's like you assume
I'll do whatever you want.

12:07.238 --> 12:09.033
Karolina, there's
a lot going on right now.

12:09.034 --> 12:11.037
Yeah, and there's lot
going on with me too,

12:11.038 --> 12:12.832
not that you would even notice.

12:31.161 --> 12:32.664
You okay?

12:32.665 --> 12:36.170
No. I feel really weird.

12:36.171 --> 12:38.132
Oh, Molly, sweetie, we had this talk.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.846
Menstruation's a blessing, not a curse.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.934
You just do your breathing exercises

12:42.935 --> 12:44.688
and drink the chamomile tea
I put in your thermos.

12:44.689 --> 12:46.065
If that doesn't work,

12:46.066 --> 12:47.819
go to the bathroom
and give yourself an orgasm.

12:47.820 --> 12:49.310
Mom, seriously?

12:49.334 --> 12:50.616
The oxytocins are
a natural pain reliever.

12:50.617 --> 12:52.995
- It is good advice.
- I'm putting in my earbuds now.

12:52.996 --> 12:55.501
- Listen to Mom.
- Dance squad tryouts are today.

12:55.502 --> 12:57.880
Dance squad is just cheerleading
without pom-poms.

12:57.881 --> 13:00.301
You're just reinforcing
hegemonic masculinity

13:00.302 --> 13:02.222
while marginalizing women's identity.

13:02.223 --> 13:04.686
Sure, but I love the outfits.

13:04.687 --> 13:07.149
Oh, and Gert, your new meds
are in your backpack.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.736
Fewer side effects than the Lexapro,

13:08.737 --> 13:10.573
and not so much with the constipation.

13:10.574 --> 13:14.204
Oh, are you a little bit backed-up, Gert?
I have some bran bars.

13:14.205 --> 13:17.712
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me tell ya, Dad is on the regular.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.966
- Don't you want your...?
- Bye, Dale. Bye, Stacey.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.845
- ...bran bars? Goodbye, sweetie!
- Love you!

13:21.846 --> 13:23.431
- Bye!
- Love you!

13:25.854 --> 13:28.274
Yeah, tell all your friends.
Everyone's welcome.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.153
Hey, do you want to join my new club?

13:30.154 --> 13:32.784
Tell all your friends.
Everyone's welcome.

13:32.785 --> 13:35.957
Hey, Chase, I was thinking,
do you want to join my new club?

13:37.043 --> 13:38.671
Hey, loser.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.552
Tragic.

13:52.741 --> 13:55.746
Hope you have a beautiful day.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.126
Can't believe you were
ever friends with her.

14:38.415 --> 14:40.794
Hey, Mom, thinking of having

14:40.795 --> 14:42.798
a little get-together tonight
at the house.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.384
<i>- Is that cool?</i>
- Tonight?

14:44.385 --> 14:46.848
<i>Yeah, I figured like old times.</i>

14:46.849 --> 14:48.852
You know, when parents have
their annual PRIDE meeting

14:48.853 --> 14:51.148
while we all hang out and make fun
of you all behind your backs.

14:51.149 --> 14:52.777
<i>So that's what went down.</i>

14:52.778 --> 14:54.989
I mean, who knows
if they'll even say yes.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.202
<i>Well, you won't know
unless you take a chance.</i>

14:57.203 --> 15:00.291
<i>Tonight's fine.
We'd love to see the kids.</i>

15:00.292 --> 15:02.045
Need me to do anything?

15:02.046 --> 15:05.176
<i>- Uh, keep the liquor cabinet unlocked?</i>
- Nice try.

15:05.177 --> 15:07.808
Okay, how about pizza
and sodas for seven?

15:08.893 --> 15:12.984
- Six.
<i>- Alex.</i>

15:12.985 --> 15:17.033
It's okay, Mom, I got this.

15:17.034 --> 15:19.956
I hope you're right about this
not being a big deal.

15:19.957 --> 15:22.545
We used to do it all the time
with the kids in the house.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.549
Besides, they're teenagers.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.388
The last thing they're interested
in is what their parents are doing.

16:03.795 --> 16:05.673
We're ready.

16:08.095 --> 16:11.936
Tonight, another becomes eternal.

16:33.145 --> 16:35.858
We hear so much lip service
about women's empowerment,

16:35.859 --> 16:38.070
as if women aren't already powerful,

16:38.071 --> 16:41.452
but, I mean, do you ever hear anyone
talking about masculine authority?

16:41.453 --> 16:44.877
Of course not! Because it's already
baked into the concept, am I right?

16:47.799 --> 16:51.556
My point is that the system
needs to be dismantled,

16:51.557 --> 16:55.354
which is why I'm starting
a new club on campus,

16:55.355 --> 16:57.860
undermining the patriarchy.

16:57.861 --> 17:02.411
We can celebrate our self-worth
while taking down the man!

17:03.915 --> 17:07.377
I only need four members for the club

17:07.378 --> 17:11.094
to be officially recognized
by the school, so...

17:11.095 --> 17:13.432
Gert has prepared some literature,

17:13.433 --> 17:15.394
so just raise your hand
if you're interested,

17:15.395 --> 17:16.941
and she will sign you up.

17:21.281 --> 17:24.037
You have until the bell
for first period.

17:24.038 --> 17:25.875
Any other announcements?

17:34.392 --> 17:36.144
Whoa, are those the, uh,

17:36.145 --> 17:37.940
God, what did you call
them, handblasters?

17:37.941 --> 17:39.777
It's so cool you're still working on it.

17:39.778 --> 17:42.407
Handblasters? No, these would
be bionic prosthetics

17:42.408 --> 17:43.952
using myoelectric sensors.

17:43.953 --> 17:45.414
I'm calling them Fist...

17:47.042 --> 17:48.962
Wait, why am I even talking to you?

17:48.963 --> 17:50.966
Actually, I was talking to you.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.970
I was thinking that maybe you might want

17:52.971 --> 17:56.268
to get together tonight, just
all of us, like we used to.

17:56.269 --> 17:58.147
Seriously, Wilder?
You think I'll come over

17:58.148 --> 18:00.234
to hang out like we're still friends?

18:00.235 --> 18:02.823
- Just keep your voice down.
- Wait, you're joking. He's joking, right?

18:02.824 --> 18:04.577
That is what I expected
you to say, Gert,

18:04.578 --> 18:06.121
which is why I was hoping

18:06.122 --> 18:07.916
that if I could get Chase
on board first and...

18:07.917 --> 18:10.463
Oh, right, because I totally
make all my decisions based

18:10.464 --> 18:13.177
off of what some roided-out
jockstrap has to say.

18:13.178 --> 18:14.847
Hey! I've got opinions.

18:14.848 --> 18:17.561
Right, about what flavored
protein powder to use, right?

18:17.562 --> 18:19.314
And we really admire you for it.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.068
Classic Gert, you see?

18:21.069 --> 18:22.780
This kind of delightful banter

18:22.781 --> 18:24.115
is why I think
we should all get together

18:24.116 --> 18:25.368
and hang out at my place tonight.

18:25.369 --> 18:26.913
You're having people over tonight?

18:26.914 --> 18:28.667
Why, are you interested?

18:28.668 --> 18:30.419
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I can't.
I have a church thing.

18:30.420 --> 18:31.964
You could just come by after that.

18:31.965 --> 18:33.885
It doesn't have to interfere
with your religion.

18:33.886 --> 18:35.931
Religion, is that
what we're calling it now?

18:35.932 --> 18:38.227
What I believe in is
positive and life-affirming,

18:38.228 --> 18:41.024
and it doesn't allow me to be cut
down by some miserable loser.

18:41.025 --> 18:42.778
Oh, think she was referring
to you, Wilder!

18:42.779 --> 18:45.074
But you do realize that no institution

18:45.075 --> 18:47.328
has been as oppressive to women
as organized religion.

18:47.329 --> 18:49.165
Except my mother runs my church.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.794
You call yourself a feminist, Gert,

18:50.795 --> 18:53.006
yet no one cuts down
other women more than you do.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.637
Not all of them, no, just the ones
who walk around with fake smiles

18:55.638 --> 18:57.558
- pretending to be happy all the time.
- Okay, guys...

18:57.559 --> 18:59.645
At least I'm trying. When was the
last time you took a shower?

19:01.149 --> 19:02.483
Okay, because having shiny hair

19:02.484 --> 19:04.279
somehow gives you moral authority!

19:04.280 --> 19:05.407
Also, yesterday.

19:07.494 --> 19:10.458
Yo, Chase. Let's roll.

19:10.459 --> 19:13.549
- I gotta go.
- 'Cause of these guys?

19:15.177 --> 19:17.388
You used to make fun of kids like them.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.519
Yeah, and now we make fun
of kids like you.

19:26.658 --> 19:28.746
And you wanted us all to hang out?

19:31.125 --> 19:32.879
Not for me...

19:35.551 --> 19:36.678
for her.

19:45.947 --> 19:48.786
<i>♪ We gon' make you lose control ♪</i>

19:51.667 --> 19:54.087
<i>♪ We gon' make you lose control ♪</i>

19:54.088 --> 19:57.009
Thank you, Hanna, that was awesome.

19:57.010 --> 20:01.728
Um, next we have Molly Hernandez.

20:22.896 --> 20:25.901
Sorry, um, I have some bad cramps.

20:25.902 --> 20:28.488
Okay, why don't you go
to the meditation center

20:28.489 --> 20:31.286
and breathe through the pain?
Or the nurses' office.

20:31.287 --> 20:33.040
We can reschedule this.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.001
Next!

20:40.598 --> 20:42.726
I'm just saying if
there's any way you can find it

20:42.727 --> 20:44.395
in your heart, just
to reconsider this grade.

20:44.396 --> 20:47.653
I don't grade with my heart.
I use my head and a red pen.

20:47.654 --> 20:50.157
But in the case of your test,
I might've needed two.

20:50.158 --> 20:52.704
Oh, sick burn, Señor Walter!

20:52.705 --> 20:54.207
Much respect!

20:54.208 --> 20:56.127
Sir, look, I know I've been messing up.

20:56.128 --> 20:58.298
I want to change.
I just need a little help.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.137
Let me re-take the midterm,
do a project for extra credit...

21:01.138 --> 21:03.559
- Try studying next time.
- Sir, please, I can't get a "C."

21:03.560 --> 21:06.607
Look, I appreciate your new
enthusiasm for learning,

21:06.608 --> 21:08.361
but there's nothing I can do.

21:21.596 --> 21:23.600
Señor Walter is such a dick, right?

21:25.478 --> 21:28.025
I mean, doesn't he realize that this is

21:28.026 --> 21:30.320
an elite Westside private school,

21:30.321 --> 21:33.452
and if one of his overprivileged
students wants his grade changed,

21:33.453 --> 21:36.125
- it's gonna happen.
- How long were you listening?

21:37.503 --> 21:39.591
Just long enough
to realize you need help.

21:40.843 --> 21:43.556
My dad's just really on my ass.

21:43.557 --> 21:45.810
I can't ask him to pay for a tutor.

21:45.811 --> 21:47.606
You could ask me.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.358
What, to pay for my tutor?

21:49.359 --> 21:52.281
No, I could help you learn Spanish.

21:52.282 --> 21:54.160
I could tutor you.

21:54.161 --> 21:56.039
You'd really do that?

21:56.040 --> 21:59.797
Sure, yeah. I mean, obviously
you're in dire need of saving,

21:59.798 --> 22:02.051
and given my mastery
of the foreign tongue,

22:02.052 --> 22:04.264
it would be selfish of me
to not share it with you.

22:05.768 --> 22:08.438
My skills, not my tongue.

22:10.318 --> 22:13.115
That sounds like Spanish to me.

22:13.116 --> 22:15.203
Tonight? I'll pay for the coffee?

22:17.082 --> 22:18.544
I'll drink it.

22:22.092 --> 22:26.015
Yo. So Brando's cousin's promoting
at some downtown party tonight.

22:26.016 --> 22:28.270
He told me to invite whoever,
no IDs needed.

22:28.271 --> 22:29.773
Bro, we're so going.

22:29.774 --> 22:31.528
- Tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

22:42.007 --> 22:44.428
There she is!

22:51.400 --> 22:52.904
Check out the freak show!

23:12.067 --> 23:16.282
Hey, Nico, I've been wanting
to talk to you all day.

23:16.283 --> 23:18.495
Actually, it's been longer than that,

23:18.496 --> 23:20.374
a lot longer.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.629
Maybe you heard...
hopefully you didn't...

23:22.630 --> 23:26.386
that I wanted to get
everybody back together.

23:26.387 --> 23:31.271
Just it turns out I'm the
only one that feels that way.

23:31.272 --> 23:36.031
And I know that it can't be
like it was, but the truth...

23:39.037 --> 23:40.415
I miss you guys.

23:43.630 --> 23:45.133
Okay...

23:47.178 --> 23:48.724
The real, real truth?

23:51.270 --> 23:52.940
I miss you, Nico.

24:19.619 --> 24:23.543
<i>♪ Every day, a stranger ♪</i>

24:27.718 --> 24:33.395
<i>♪ Then we walk through the garden... ♪</i>

24:56.275 --> 24:58.028
Is everything okay?

25:00.199 --> 25:01.744
So good.

25:04.249 --> 25:05.585
You?

25:05.586 --> 25:07.005
Mm-hmm.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.473
Yeah, I think it's just
allergies or something.

25:12.474 --> 25:16.397
Is it just me, or is there, like, an
impossible amount of pollen in the air?

25:16.398 --> 25:18.694
Think I read that somewhere.

25:18.695 --> 25:21.658
Not enough bees or some shit.

25:21.659 --> 25:23.162
Mm-hmm.

25:24.874 --> 25:26.503
Yeah, I think that's gotta be it.

25:32.222 --> 25:34.893
If you want a tutorial, check YouTube.

25:34.894 --> 25:37.900
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare.

25:40.864 --> 25:43.744
It's just that you know that
you don't need all that, Nico.

25:43.745 --> 25:45.874
You don't have to hide
who you really are.

25:50.676 --> 25:52.680
Some people hide behind makeup...

25:53.807 --> 25:55.434
others behind a smile.

25:57.606 --> 25:58.775
It's still hiding.

26:03.284 --> 26:04.202
See?

26:24.284 --> 26:25.411
Here you go.

26:34.012 --> 26:36.265
It will take a moment
for the meds to kick in.

26:36.266 --> 26:38.979
How long is a moment?

26:38.980 --> 26:40.983
Have you talked to your mom?

26:40.984 --> 26:43.906
- Does she have these same issues?
- I don't know. I'm adopted.

26:43.907 --> 26:46.661
Well, your birth mother
made a very brave choice.

26:46.662 --> 26:50.711
Oh, it wasn't a choice.
My parents died in a fire.

26:50.712 --> 26:52.673
The Yorkes are really nice, though.

26:52.674 --> 26:56.723
Stacey's very knowledgeable about
herbs and breathing and stuff.

26:56.724 --> 26:58.434
It's just none of it's working.

26:58.435 --> 27:01.190
Well, that's why
we have modern medicine.

27:01.191 --> 27:02.694
I'll be right back.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.002
Aah!

27:19.227 --> 27:20.771
Everything okay in there?

27:20.772 --> 27:25.156
Yeah... I feel way better, actually.

27:34.758 --> 27:37.012
There are so many young members
of our congregation

27:37.013 --> 27:38.849
inspired by our message,

27:38.850 --> 27:41.270
and not just because we have
cool free jewelry.

27:41.271 --> 27:43.107
The day that you get your bracelet

27:43.108 --> 27:44.694
is one that you'll never forget,

27:44.695 --> 27:46.280
unless you're me...

27:46.281 --> 27:48.911
I kind of feel
like I was born with mine.

27:48.912 --> 27:52.793
It's funny, I've actually
never taken it off.

27:52.794 --> 27:55.883
Karolina, hi. I don't mean to interrupt.

27:55.884 --> 27:58.514
I just wanted to tell
Ms. Dean how grateful I am

27:58.515 --> 28:00.559
for everything
that her mother's done for me.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.772
Thanks. That's wonderful.

28:02.773 --> 28:04.817
Yeah, my parents weren't there for me.

28:04.818 --> 28:07.364
My life was one big rebellion.

28:07.365 --> 28:10.997
Just drama and chaos, and...

28:13.670 --> 28:16.508
I'm sorry. What am I doing?

28:16.509 --> 28:19.974
Just giving my testimonial.

28:21.978 --> 28:23.773
You're really lucky to have your mom.

28:27.154 --> 28:31.453
I'm sorry, can you guys just give
me just one... one second. Sorry.

28:31.454 --> 28:34.084
Tell me about it.

28:34.085 --> 28:36.965
Okay. Do you believe that one person

28:36.966 --> 28:38.510
can step into your life and change...

28:38.511 --> 28:41.641
Oh, no, not about my mom. Rebelling.

28:41.642 --> 28:43.813
What's it like?

28:45.942 --> 28:47.320
Hello?

28:57.966 --> 29:00.847
Dale? Stacey?

29:20.595 --> 29:23.558
You got this. Okay, you got this one.

29:23.559 --> 29:24.477
I got this.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.418
Okay...

29:38.548 --> 29:40.217
Okay, start small.

29:41.302 --> 29:42.556
Come on, bend!

29:44.434 --> 29:45.394
Come on.

29:59.590 --> 30:00.508
Come on.

30:13.325 --> 30:14.368
Yeah!

30:20.632 --> 30:22.760
Yes!

30:22.761 --> 30:25.390
Yeah! I did it!

30:53.531 --> 30:55.199
Hey, Janet, have you done

30:55.200 --> 30:56.995
something different with your hair?

30:56.996 --> 31:00.418
Thank you for noticing, Robert.

31:00.419 --> 31:03.007
Forgive me if I'm too busy
changing the world

31:03.008 --> 31:05.178
to notice that your bangs
have grown out.

31:08.476 --> 31:09.854
Every year, the Yorkeses bring

31:09.855 --> 31:11.774
that same disgusting cheese wheel.

31:11.775 --> 31:14.362
I mean, seriously, who makes
their own brie?

31:14.363 --> 31:15.782
I liked it.

31:15.783 --> 31:17.870
Smell your fingers.

31:17.871 --> 31:19.164
- Hey, Tina.
- Smells good!

31:19.165 --> 31:20.584
My WizPhone isn't downloading my mail.

31:20.585 --> 31:21.836
Can you take a look?

31:21.837 --> 31:23.464
Little below my paygrade, Stacey.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.967
I'm the CEO, not tech support.

31:24.968 --> 31:27.848
We fixed that glitch in the new update.

31:27.849 --> 31:29.309
Let me just download...

31:29.310 --> 31:31.271
Oh, yeah, if you could just make sure

31:31.272 --> 31:33.442
that her music library is backed up.

31:33.443 --> 31:35.948
She has got every tasty Phish bootleg

31:35.949 --> 31:38.662
going back to Burlington '92.

31:38.663 --> 31:43.045
If you haven't heard Trey's 14-minute
guitar solo on "Sample in a Jar,"

31:43.046 --> 31:44.674
- you've not heard music.
- Oh, yeah.

31:46.679 --> 31:50.561
I will never understand how
they were allowed into PRIDE.

31:51.981 --> 31:53.233
Everyone's here for a reason.

31:54.569 --> 31:55.655
Indeed.

32:06.593 --> 32:07.637
Hey!

32:12.939 --> 32:15.652
Yes! Boom, boom, boom, Sugar Ray!

32:15.653 --> 32:17.238
Knockdown in the eighth!

32:17.239 --> 32:20.161
Man, every time I come here,
I am blown away.

32:20.162 --> 32:22.958
You are killing it
in the real estate game.

32:22.959 --> 32:26.048
- Made some sound investments.
- Oh, come on, you're being modest.

32:26.049 --> 32:28.636
You done good
from the 'hood, my brother!

32:28.637 --> 32:32.561
That is probably not something
I'm allowed to say.

32:32.562 --> 32:34.147
- Wouldn't recommend it.
- Noted.

32:34.148 --> 32:36.528
Let's get started.

32:39.785 --> 32:42.623
Before we begin, a toast

32:42.624 --> 32:44.459
to the good work
of the PRIDE Foundation.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.171
I'm proud to announce we've surpassed

32:46.172 --> 32:48.802
our fundraising goals in record time.

32:48.803 --> 32:51.181
- To PRIDE.
- To PRIDE.

32:51.182 --> 32:53.352
Hey, Alex, you're home.

32:53.353 --> 32:54.939
What's up, buddy?

32:54.940 --> 32:56.692
Thought you were inviting
your friends over tonight.

32:56.693 --> 32:58.445
Everything's set up for you.

32:58.446 --> 33:02.788
Yeah, I invited them over, all of them,

33:02.789 --> 33:05.919
and as you can see, it went really well,

33:05.920 --> 33:10.011
so I will be out back eating
my way through pizza for six.

33:16.399 --> 33:18.277
If it's any consolation,

33:18.278 --> 33:20.950
Nico's never been the same, either.

33:23.914 --> 33:27.379
We know how hard this must be for
you both, especially tonight.

33:29.885 --> 33:33.141
- To PRIDE.
- To PRIDE.

34:08.504 --> 34:09.797
- Hey.
- Hi...

34:09.797 --> 34:12.260
Can I borrow this chair?

34:12.261 --> 34:14.889
No, sorry, someone's sitting there.

34:14.891 --> 34:16.184
He'll be here soon.

Little late, but I come in
peace... and birdseed.

39:58.620 --> 40:00.623
Where are we supposed to go?

40:00.624 --> 40:02.085
I don't care, just not here!

40:29.389 --> 40:32.896
- Close the door, bro.
- What the...?

40:35.234 --> 40:36.654
Get away from her!

40:46.214 --> 40:47.216
Hey! Hey! Hey!

40:49.513 --> 40:50.807
You're dead!

41:29.802 --> 41:33.141
Chase? What happened?

41:33.142 --> 41:34.520
I'm getting you out of here.

41:45.166 --> 41:46.626
How you feeling?

41:46.627 --> 41:48.839
I'm totally fine now.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.300
It was so weird.

41:50.301 --> 41:53.264
The last thing I remember
were these lights.

41:53.265 --> 41:55.226
They were really beautiful.

41:55.227 --> 41:58.609
Yeah. Yeah, it's called drugs.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.989
Clearly, you took some strong shit.

42:02.534 --> 42:05.956
Okay, this is yours.

42:05.957 --> 42:09.254
If you want to go home,
I can get my own ride.

42:09.255 --> 42:10.799
No, I don't want to be alone,

42:10.800 --> 42:13.054
and I definitely don't want to go home.

42:13.055 --> 42:14.224
Anywhere but there.

42:15.309 --> 42:16.228
Come on.

42:44.535 --> 42:46.871
"I summon the triple goddess

42:46.872 --> 42:49.961
in all her names, faces, and forms.

42:49.962 --> 42:54.554
I summon the mother,
the maiden, and the crone.

42:54.555 --> 42:58.060
I summon you, who lived yesterday,

42:58.061 --> 43:02.028
to emerge from night shadows
into the light."

43:15.179 --> 43:18.686
Emerge from night shadows
into the light!

43:25.992 --> 43:28.665
Show yourself here! Speak!

43:44.278 --> 43:45.782
Amy...

44:17.428 --> 44:18.806
We all got your text.

44:20.852 --> 44:23.355
Manipulative, sending that photo.

44:23.356 --> 44:27.908
But effective,
since you're almost all here.

44:35.924 --> 44:37.511
Room for one more?

44:40.850 --> 44:43.648
So... you gonna let us in?

44:47.488 --> 44:49.115
Yeah.

44:49.116 --> 44:52.074

44:52.099 --> 44:54.101

44:54.126 --> 44:57.926

45:06.317 --> 45:08.153
Yeah, if you guys don't like veggie,

45:08.154 --> 45:10.116
there's a pepperoni at the bottom.

45:10.117 --> 45:12.664
There's a sausage under,
and a pineapple, too.

45:15.210 --> 45:18.717
Or board games. Ooh, yes, Twister!

45:18.718 --> 45:21.764
- Remember that we would always...?
- We're not 12 anymore.

45:21.765 --> 45:23.768
- Not even me.
- Good point.

45:23.769 --> 45:25.731
Okay, how about suggestions,

45:25.732 --> 45:28.027
then, just anything you guys...

45:28.028 --> 45:30.198
What are you doing? That was her chair.

45:33.413 --> 45:35.585
Sit wherever you want. She's gone.

45:43.224 --> 45:44.769
This is too weird.

45:44.770 --> 45:46.815
Maybe we just don't work without her.

45:48.109 --> 45:50.446
Yeah. I'm outta here.

45:50.447 --> 45:52.660
No, come on, guys!

45:52.661 --> 45:54.204
Listen, we can't blame Amy

45:54.205 --> 45:55.749
for the fact that we
don't hang out anymore.

45:55.750 --> 45:57.920
Fine. I blame you.

45:57.921 --> 46:00.007
You didn't come to the funeral!

46:00.008 --> 46:01.719
Everyone grieves in their own way.

46:01.720 --> 46:04.182
At funerals with their friends.

46:04.183 --> 46:05.602
Yeah, who would ever do that,

46:05.603 --> 46:10.111
not show up when
a friend is expecting them?

46:10.112 --> 46:12.407
I'm just saying, Wilder not showing up

46:12.408 --> 46:13.910
was the first crack in the wall.

46:13.911 --> 46:15.622
That wall was always coming down.

46:15.623 --> 46:18.460
We were friends because
our parents were friends.

46:18.461 --> 46:20.549
We were just kids.
We were always gonna grow apart.

46:20.550 --> 46:22.636
Plus, it's kind of hard
to stay friends with someone

46:22.637 --> 46:25.016
when all they care about is
being the perfect church girl.

46:25.017 --> 46:27.270
Better than the insufferable
social justice warrior.

46:27.271 --> 46:28.858
- Or a dumb jock.
- Yeah, or Molly.

46:31.070 --> 46:32.907
I've got nothing against you.
You're really nice.

46:34.076 --> 46:35.037
What about me?

46:37.667 --> 46:38.918
Nico...

46:38.919 --> 46:41.925
Whatever I am now, it's not Amy.

46:44.096 --> 46:45.974
Sorry to let you all down.

46:45.975 --> 46:48.353
What? No, come on.
Nobody's thinking that.

46:48.354 --> 46:51.570
Great party, Alex. Thanks for
all the pizza and sadness.

46:52.989 --> 46:55.034
Yeah, for once I agree with Chase.

46:55.035 --> 46:56.537
What are we doing here?

46:56.538 --> 46:59.000
We'd all moved on. We were doing fine.

46:59.001 --> 47:00.587
No, none of us is fine,

47:00.588 --> 47:03.843
and I, for one, am sick
of pretending that I am.

47:03.844 --> 47:06.349
We need to sit together
and talk this through.

47:15.868 --> 47:19.835
Fine. Then I'm gonna need some alcohol.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.965
What? Hey...

47:22.966 --> 47:24.552
Where are you going?

47:24.553 --> 47:26.722
As I recall, your dad keeps a bottle

47:26.723 --> 47:28.267
of Pappy Van Winkle's in his study.

47:28.268 --> 47:30.104
I've been sipping on it since I was 13.

47:30.105 --> 47:32.358
Yeah, but they're in there now,
having their meeting!

47:32.359 --> 47:35.949
Hey, Alex, can I ask you a question?

47:35.950 --> 47:36.993
Yeah.

47:36.994 --> 47:39.582
You still never told me

47:39.583 --> 47:41.628
why you didn't come to the funeral.

47:45.135 --> 47:47.054
I guess what difference does it make?

47:47.055 --> 47:48.809
It wouldn't bring her back.

47:52.232 --> 47:55.531
Thanks for doing this... tonight.

47:56.950 --> 47:58.119
For me.

48:01.543 --> 48:03.963
Hey, Alex!

48:03.964 --> 48:06.794
You can take the stick
out of your ass now. They're gone.

48:22.209 --> 48:25.214
- Don't touch anything, okay?
- Too late!

48:25.215 --> 48:28.888
Dad says there's no reason
to be in here when he's not.

48:28.889 --> 48:30.600
Why is my mom's purse here?

48:30.601 --> 48:31.852
Where are they?

48:31.853 --> 48:33.022
I don't know, and I don't care.

48:34.818 --> 48:37.864
All right, he must've
moved the good stuff.

48:37.865 --> 48:39.410
This'll do.

48:42.082 --> 48:44.503
Bourbon on the rocks,
shaken, not stirred.

48:44.504 --> 48:46.090
I don't think so.

48:52.352 --> 48:53.271
Hey.

48:59.325 --> 49:00.911
Hey, look, I'm sorry about tonight.

49:02.122 --> 49:03.834
Clearly you got a better offer.

49:06.631 --> 49:08.593
It's not like that.

49:08.594 --> 49:11.515
Look, I was a total douche, okay, and...

49:11.516 --> 49:14.104
I don't know, maybe we can try again.

49:19.783 --> 49:21.284
That means no.

49:21.285 --> 49:24.332
Wow, you really do need a tutor.

49:24.333 --> 49:25.501
And she needs a lime.

49:25.502 --> 49:27.005
And a coaster.

49:29.844 --> 49:30.888
What the...?

49:39.279 --> 49:41.826
Holy shit, what just happened?

49:41.827 --> 49:45.082
You mean other than
a secret passageway opening?

49:45.083 --> 49:48.088
Where does it go?

49:48.089 --> 49:49.340
Bomb shelter?

49:49.341 --> 49:51.679
No, a kick-ass wine cellar, definitely.

49:51.680 --> 49:54.392
In the past when religions
are being persecuted,

49:54.393 --> 49:56.814
sometimes believers would build
secret temples to worship.

49:56.815 --> 49:59.486
Yeah, but this is Brentwood,
not Bethlehem.

50:00.781 --> 50:04.121
This is some Narnia shit.

50:05.415 --> 50:06.918
There's only one way to find out.

50:08.922 --> 50:09.924
Let's do it.

50:17.732 --> 50:20.863
How long has this been under my house?

50:22.407 --> 50:24.745
Longer than your house has been over it.

50:24.746 --> 50:26.999
I'm cold.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.505
Houses in LA, they don't
even have basements.

50:29.506 --> 50:31.466
I'm not sure "basement" is the right way

50:31.467 --> 50:33.304
to describe whatever the hell this is.

50:46.915 --> 50:50.254
What is happening?

50:50.255 --> 50:51.590
Shh!

50:51.591 --> 50:54.220
I don't think they can hear us.

50:58.145 --> 51:02.362
There's, like a... a barrier.

51:04.491 --> 51:07.414
What kind of charity meeting is this?

51:09.209 --> 51:11.045
Wait, guys, that's my mom!

51:11.046 --> 51:12.132
Who is she with?

51:14.469 --> 51:16.265
I know that girl!

51:29.458 --> 51:32.297
Okay, the creep factor
just went up to, like, 11.

51:35.011 --> 51:36.430
- Molly, you can't unsee this.
- Gert!

51:57.389 --> 51:59.308
- What just happened?!
- Gert, I wanna see, too!

51:59.309 --> 52:00.646
- Wait, don't!
- No!

52:06.658 --> 52:08.662
What the hell was that?

52:10.833 --> 52:15.833
