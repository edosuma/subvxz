"Chapter one."

00:48.114 --> 00:52.284
"He adored New York City.
He idolized it all out of proportion."

00:52.451 --> 00:57.163
Uh, no. Make that "He romanticized it
all out of proportion."

00:57.331 --> 00:59.749
"To him,
no matter what the season was...

00:59.917 --> 01:03.128
...this was still a town
that existed in black and white...

01:03.296 --> 01:06.548
...and pulsated to the great tunes
of George Gershwin."

01:06.716 --> 01:09.217
Uh... no. Let me start this over.

01:09.385 --> 01:11.469
"Chapter one."

01:11.637 --> 01:15.515
"He was too romantic about Manhattan,
as he was about everything else."

01:15.683 --> 01:19.269
"He thrived on the hustle, bustle
of the crowds and the traffic."

01:19.437 --> 01:21.646
"To him, New York
meant beautiful women...

01:21.814 --> 01:25.610
...and street-smart guys
who seemed to know all the angles."

01:25.777 --> 01:29.030
Ah, corny. Too corny
for a man of my taste.

01:29.197 --> 01:31.490
Let me... try and make it more profound.

01:31.658 --> 01:35.411
"Chapter one. He adored New York City."

01:35.579 --> 01:39.874
"To him, it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture."

01:40.042 --> 01:44.170
"The same lack of integrity to cause so
many people to take the easy way out...

01:44.338 --> 01:47.173
...was rapidly turning the town
of his dreams..."

01:47.341 --> 01:51.636
No, it's gonna be too preachy. I mean,
face it, I wanna sell some books here.

01:51.803 --> 01:54.597
"Chapter one. He adored New York City...

01:54.765 --> 01:59.143
...although to him it was a metaphor
for the decay of contemporary culture."

01:59.311 --> 02:04.649
"How hard it was to exist in a society
desensitized by drugs, loud music...

02:04.816 --> 02:07.610
...television, crime, garbage..."

02:07.778 --> 02:09.946
Too angry. I don't wanna be angry.

02:10.113 --> 02:12.406
"Chapter one."

02:12.574 --> 02:15.576
"He was as tough and romantic
as the city he loved."

02:15.744 --> 02:19.038
"Behind his black-rimmed glasses
was the coiled sexual power

02:19.207 --> 02:20.457
of a jungle cat."

02:20.625 --> 02:22.167
I love this.

02:22.335 --> 02:25.754
"New York was his town
and it always would be."

04:20.997 --> 04:26.919
I think the essence of art is to provide
a kind of working-through situation...

04:27.087 --> 04:30.589
...so that you can get in touch
with feelings you didn't know you had.

04:30.757 --> 04:35.052
Talent is luck.
The important thing in life is courage.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.221
They've had this argument
for 20 years.

04:37.388 --> 04:39.473
Listen to this example.

04:39.641 --> 04:44.561
If the four of us are walking home over
the bridge and a person was drowning...

04:44.729 --> 04:46.730
...would we have the nerve...

04:46.898 --> 04:50.692
Would one of us have the nerve to dive
into the icy water and save them?

04:50.860 --> 04:52.653
It's a key question.

04:52.821 --> 04:55.656
I, of course, can't swim,
so I never have to face it.

04:56.491 --> 04:58.575
Oh... God.

04:59.202 --> 05:01.286
Which of us?

05:02.413 --> 05:05.040
- You want a little more?
- No.

05:05.208 --> 05:09.003
Mm. Oh, man. That is so great.

05:09.171 --> 05:10.964
You don't smoke.

05:11.132 --> 05:15.718
I know I don't smoke. I don't inhale
because it gives you cancer, but...

05:16.137 --> 05:21.266
...I look so incredibly handsome with
a cigarette that I can't not hold one.

05:22.852 --> 05:24.853
- You like the way I look?
- Mm-hm.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.396
Provocative.

05:26.564 --> 05:30.525
- I'm getting through to you?
- Yup. You have to excuse me a sec.

05:31.694 --> 05:35.029
- Jesus, she's gorgeous.
- Mm.

05:35.906 --> 05:37.991
But she's 17.

05:38.325 --> 05:40.410
I'm 42 and she's 17.

05:41.245 --> 05:45.540
I'm... I'm older than her father.
Can you believe that?

05:46.041 --> 05:49.043
I'm dating a girl
wherein I can beat up her father.

05:49.211 --> 05:52.172
That's the first time
that ever occurred in my life.

05:52.339 --> 05:56.551
- He's drunk.
- You're drunk. You should never drink.

05:56.719 --> 06:00.263
Did I tell you... that my ex-wife...

06:00.431 --> 06:04.184
- Who, Tina?
- Mm-mm. My second ex-wife...

06:05.020 --> 06:08.063
...is writing a book about
our marriage and the break-up.

06:08.231 --> 06:11.442
- That's really tacky.
- It's really depressing, you know.

06:11.610 --> 06:16.197
She's gonna give all those details out,
all my little idiosyncrasies...

06:16.364 --> 06:18.824
...and my quirks and mannerisms, and...

06:18.992 --> 06:22.828
Mm, mm, not that I have
anything to hide because, you know...

06:22.996 --> 06:27.499
But there are a few disgusting
little moments that I regret.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.544
It's just gossip.
Gossip is the new pornography.

06:30.712 --> 06:34.173
- You should never let me drink.
- I know.

06:34.341 --> 06:36.550
You should never let yourself drink.

06:36.718 --> 06:39.345
We oughta go
'cause I've got an exam tomorrow.

06:39.512 --> 06:42.014
Oh, do you? The kid's gotta get up...

06:44.142 --> 06:47.186
She's got homework.
I'm dating a girl who does homework.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.689
What is it? What's the matter with you?

06:50.857 --> 06:54.818
You... you... Where are you now?
Your mind is like a million miles away.

06:54.986 --> 06:56.987
I have something I wanna say.

06:57.155 --> 07:00.032
I, uh, I just didn't know
quite how to... get into it.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.285
Um, I, uh...

07:03.120 --> 07:07.499
About seven or eight weeks ago
I went to this dinner party...

07:07.667 --> 07:09.751
...and I met a woman there.

07:10.461 --> 07:12.754
And...

07:12.922 --> 07:16.258
And I've got
kind of involved with her.

07:16.425 --> 07:17.509
You're kidding?

07:17.677 --> 07:21.346
It started out very casually.
I mean, we had lunch a couple of times.

07:21.514 --> 07:23.014
And now it's, you know,

07:23.182 --> 07:25.934
it's getting out of hand
and I don't know what to do about it.

07:26.102 --> 07:28.186
I mean, I'm... It's scary.

07:28.354 --> 07:31.356
Well, who is she? What are the details?

07:31.524 --> 07:33.692
- Well, she's a journalist.
- Uh-huh.

07:33.859 --> 07:35.443
She's very...

07:35.611 --> 07:38.029
- Is she married, too?
- No, no.

07:38.197 --> 07:40.448
- She's very beautiful.
- Mm-mm.

07:40.616 --> 07:44.577
She's very kind of
nervous, high-strung, illusive.

07:44.745 --> 07:47.163
Great. It sounds wonderful.

07:47.331 --> 07:51.668
Oh, she is wonderful.
I mean, she's on my mind all the time.

07:51.836 --> 07:54.921
What are you telling me?
That your marriage is...

07:55.089 --> 07:58.718
I mean, how serious is it?

07:58.885 --> 08:01.345
I don't know, but it's pretty serious.

08:01.513 --> 08:03.347
But you haven't
said anything to Emily?

08:03.515 --> 08:05.057
No! God, no.

08:05.225 --> 08:08.686
It's amazing. I'm stunned
because, of all the people I know...

08:08.854 --> 08:12.940
...I always thought for sure that you
and Emily had one of the best marriages.

08:13.108 --> 08:15.443
We do! I mean, I love her.

08:15.610 --> 08:17.987
- But you're seeing...
- I know it.

08:18.155 --> 08:20.906
But in all the years
that we've been married...

08:21.074 --> 08:25.286
...I've had, what... one or two
very minor things with other women.

08:25.454 --> 08:28.622
I mean, very... I hate the whole idea.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.375
I hate myself
when I'm doing this sort of thing.

08:31.543 --> 08:34.587
But this is just, you know...
This is not like that.

08:34.755 --> 08:38.174
It's terrible. Listen,
you shouldn't ask me for advice.

08:38.342 --> 08:43.346
When it comes to relationships, I'm the
winner of the August Strindberg Award.

08:43.513 --> 08:48.100
Well, I don't think 17 is too young.
Beside that, she's a bright girl.

08:48.268 --> 08:51.604
You'll get no argument from me.
I think she's terrific.

08:51.772 --> 08:54.983
He could do a lot worse.
He has done a lot worse.

08:55.151 --> 08:57.361
I just think he's wasting his life.

08:57.528 --> 09:00.655
He writes that crap for television.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.660
Yale, have you ever thought
any more about having kids?

09:06.537 --> 09:08.622
Oh, my God. Kids.

09:08.790 --> 09:12.667
Listen, I've gotta get this book
finished. It's never gonna get done.

09:12.835 --> 09:16.129
I've gotta get the money
to get this magazine started, huh?

09:16.297 --> 09:17.881
Kids...

09:18.049 --> 09:21.676
We always talk about moving to
Connecticut. You could do it there.

09:21.844 --> 09:24.262
- Connecticut.
- Yeah.

09:24.430 --> 09:27.641
I can't go to Connecticut.
It's not practical.

09:27.809 --> 09:29.810
All my stuff's here.

09:29.977 --> 09:32.437
My work's here.
It's just the wrong time.

09:32.605 --> 09:36.066
What about Isaac?
We can't abandon him, you know?

09:36.234 --> 09:40.237
He can't function anywhere
other than New York, you know that.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.489
Very Freudian.

09:43.699 --> 09:45.992
Mm-mm...

10:00.092 --> 10:02.343
Are you writing a book
on our marriage?

10:02.511 --> 10:03.594
Leave me alone.

10:03.762 --> 10:07.849
- Are you writing about our break-up?
- We've said all that needs to be said.

10:08.016 --> 10:10.852
I know you are because
I have a friend at Random House.

10:11.019 --> 10:14.272
- I'm free to do as I please.
- Yeah, but this affects me.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.109
So you're gonna tell everybody
everything? Our life, our sexual life?

10:18.277 --> 10:19.652
Do you spy on me?

10:19.820 --> 10:23.448
No. I was at a party and a guy said
he read an advance chapter...

10:23.615 --> 10:27.326
...of a book my wife was writing,
and it was hot stuff. He said that!

10:27.494 --> 10:31.372
- I spilled wine on my pants.
- I don't care to discuss it.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.041
- You won't discuss it. How's Willie?
- Fine.

10:34.209 --> 10:38.546
Well, give me some details. Does he
play baseball? Wear dresses? What?

10:38.714 --> 10:40.715
He doesn't wear dresses.

10:40.883 --> 10:43.551
You'll find out the details
when it's your turn to see him.

10:43.719 --> 10:46.345
Don't write this book.
It's a humiliating experience.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.807
It's an honest account of our break-up.

10:48.975 --> 10:52.144
Jesus, everybody that knows us
is gonna know everything.

10:52.312 --> 10:54.521
Look at you. You're so threatened.

10:54.689 --> 10:59.651
I'm not threatened because I was not
the immoral, psychotic, promiscuous one.

10:59.819 --> 11:02.196
I hope I didn't leave out anything.

11:07.911 --> 11:12.956
Are you telling me that... that I'm...
that you had three affairs before me?

11:13.124 --> 11:16.585
That's really hard to believe.
It's mind-boggling.

11:16.753 --> 11:20.839
When I was your age, I was still being
tucked in by my grandparents.

11:21.007 --> 11:25.135
Well, they were really immature boys.
They were nothing like you.

11:25.303 --> 11:27.304
No? What does that mean?

11:27.472 --> 11:30.557
Well, I told you before.
I think I'm in love with you.

11:30.725 --> 11:32.976
Hey, don't get carried away, OK?

11:33.144 --> 11:36.647
This is... This is a terrific thing -
move over - you know.

11:36.814 --> 11:40.400
And we're having a great time,
but you're a kid

11:40.568 --> 11:42.694
and I never want you to forget that.

11:42.862 --> 11:45.532
You're gonna meet
a lot of terrific men in your life...

11:45.699 --> 11:47.825
...and, you know,
I want you to enjoy me.

11:47.993 --> 11:52.038
My wry sense of humor
And astonishing sexual technique...

11:52.206 --> 11:56.209
...but never forget that you've...
you've got your whole life ahead of you.

11:56.377 --> 11:58.545
Don't you have any feelings for me?

11:58.712 --> 12:02.257
How can you ask that?
I've got nothing but feelings for you...

12:02.424 --> 12:06.052
...but you don't wanna get hung up
with one person at your age.

12:06.220 --> 12:09.389
It's... charming, you know.

12:09.557 --> 12:12.475
Erotic.
No question about that.

12:12.643 --> 12:14.727
As long as the cops don't burst in,

12:14.895 --> 12:17.105
I think we're gonna break
a couple of records.

12:17.273 --> 12:20.608
But you can't, uh, you can't...
It's not a good thing.

12:20.776 --> 12:25.071
You should think of me sort of
as a detour on the highway of life.

12:25.239 --> 12:28.866
- So get dressed because you gotta go.
- Don't you want me to stay over?

12:29.034 --> 12:31.244
I don't want you to get in the habit...

12:31.412 --> 12:33.997
...because first you stay one night,
then two nights,

12:34.164 --> 12:36.416
and then you're living here.

12:36.584 --> 12:39.252
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's not a great idea.

12:39.420 --> 12:42.923
You won't like it, believe me.
I'm tough to get along with.

12:43.091 --> 12:47.928
Tomorrow we'll go to the cinema and I'll
show you the Veronica Lake movie. OK?

12:48.096 --> 12:51.724
OK. Veronica Lake's
the pin-up with the red hair?

12:51.891 --> 12:55.769
No, that's Rita Hayworth.
Do we have to go over this all the time?

12:55.937 --> 12:59.690
- Rita who?
- Rita Hayworth. Are you joking with me?

12:59.858 --> 13:04.653
Course I'm joking! You think I'm unaware
of any event pre-Paul McCartney.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.451
- I find these photographs interesting.
- Yes, so do I.

13:10.619 --> 13:14.246
- Do you ever use the camera I got you?
- Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.

13:14.414 --> 13:18.042
I was taking pictures in our drama
class. It's fun, really neat.

13:18.209 --> 13:21.003
You know you sound like
the mouse in Tom And Jerry.

13:21.171 --> 13:22.546
Are you kidding me?

13:22.714 --> 13:26.258
- You should talk! You've a whiny voice!
- Sh! You sound like the mouse.

13:26.426 --> 13:28.218
Well, thanks.

13:28.386 --> 13:31.555
I know, I'm a whiner.

13:33.099 --> 13:35.851
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

13:36.019 --> 13:38.938
- How long have you been here?
- We were talking about you.

13:39.106 --> 13:43.526
That's hilarious. Wh... What... Were you
walking around behind us or what?

13:43.694 --> 13:46.905
- How are you? Hi.
- Good. That's funny. We were talking...

13:47.073 --> 13:49.991
We're gonna go to
the Shakespeare In The Park thing.

13:50.159 --> 13:52.160
Oh, yeah, right. I wanna do that.

13:52.328 --> 13:55.872
Oh, this is my friend.
Mary Wilke, Isaac Davis and Tracy.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.083
- How do you do?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.501
You, too.

13:59.669 --> 14:01.252
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:01.420 --> 14:04.422
We were downstairs.
We saw the photography exhibition.

14:04.590 --> 14:07.175
- Absolutely incredible.
- It's really good.

14:07.343 --> 14:08.760
Really?

14:08.928 --> 14:11.513
- The photographs downstairs?
- Yes.

14:11.681 --> 14:14.516
Great. Absolutely great. Did you?

14:14.684 --> 14:16.810
No, I really felt
it was very derivative.

14:16.977 --> 14:19.354
To me it looked like it was
straight out of Diane Arbus,

14:19.522 --> 14:21.481
but it had none of the wit.

14:21.649 --> 14:25.318
Well, we didn't like it
as much as the Plexiglas sculpture.

14:25.486 --> 14:27.237
You liked the Plexiglas?

14:27.405 --> 14:29.781
You didn't like the Plexiglas either?

14:29.949 --> 14:33.494
Ah, that's interesting.
Nah, no... uh-uh.

14:33.662 --> 14:37.164
It was a lot better than that...
that steel cube. Did you see it?

14:37.332 --> 14:41.377
- Oh, yeah. That was the worst.
- Now that was brilliant to me.

14:41.545 --> 14:43.546
- The cube was brilliant?
- Yes.

14:43.714 --> 14:46.757
To me it was very textural.
You know what I mean?

14:46.925 --> 14:49.552
It was perfectly integrated
and it had a...

14:49.720 --> 14:51.637
a marvelous kind of negative capability.

14:51.805 --> 14:53.889
The rest of the stuff was bullshit.

14:57.936 --> 15:00.771
- You wanna see the Sol Lewitt?
- Sure. That'd be fun.

15:00.939 --> 15:02.314
You wanna see that?

15:02.482 --> 15:05.985
He opens at the Modern soon. I was
gonna do a piece on Sol for Insights.

15:06.153 --> 15:09.071
Do you know that magazine?
It's a little magazine.

15:09.239 --> 15:13.325
They're such schmucks up there.
Really mired in Thirties radicalism.

15:13.493 --> 15:15.828
- What do you do, Tracy?
- I go to high school.

15:15.996 --> 15:21.000
Oh, really. Really. Somewhere Nabokov
is smiling, if you know what I mean.

15:21.877 --> 15:25.504
LeWitt is overrated. In fact,
he may be a candidate for the academy.

15:25.672 --> 15:26.964
Right!

15:27.132 --> 15:31.344
Mary and I have invented the Academy
of the Overrated for such notables as...

15:31.512 --> 15:34.639
...Gustav Mahler...
- Isak Dinesen and Carl Jung.

15:34.807 --> 15:38.268
...Scott Fitzgerald.
- Lenny Bruce. Can't forget him, can we?

15:38.436 --> 15:42.189
- How about Norman Mailer?
- I think those people are all terrific.

15:42.356 --> 15:46.067
- Who was that guy you had?
- I didn't. It was yours. Heinrich BÃ¶ll.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.862
- Overrated?
- Don't wanna leave out Heinrich.

15:49.030 --> 15:52.449
Gee, what about Mozart?
You guys don't wanna leave out Mozart.

15:52.617 --> 15:56.411
- Well, how about Vincent Van Goch?
- She said "Van Goch"?!

15:56.579 --> 15:58.830
- Or Ingmar Bergman?
- You'll get in trouble.

15:58.998 --> 16:02.125
Bergman? Bergman's the only genius
in cinema today, I think.

16:02.293 --> 16:04.085
He's a big Bergman fan.

16:04.253 --> 16:08.048
God, you're so the opposite.
You write that fabulous television show.

16:08.216 --> 16:11.009
It's so funny and
his view is so Scandinavian.

16:11.177 --> 16:14.179
It's bleak, my God.
I mean, all that Kierkegaard, right?

16:14.347 --> 16:19.351
Real adolescent, fashionable pessimism.
I mean, the silence. God's silence.

16:19.519 --> 16:22.521
OK, OK, OK. I mean,
I loved it when I was at Radcliffe,

16:22.688 --> 16:24.815
but, all right, you outgrow it.

16:24.982 --> 16:28.319
Get her away from me. I don't think
I can take too much more of her.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.947
No. Don't you guys see?

16:31.114 --> 16:34.742
It is the dignifying of one's
psychological and sexual hang-ups...

16:34.910 --> 16:38.579
...by attaching them to these
grandiose, philosophical issues?

16:38.747 --> 16:39.747
Here we are.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.124
Uh, listen,
it was very nice meeting you.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.127
It was a pleasure
and a sincere sensation...

16:45.295 --> 16:48.214
...but we have to go.
We gotta do some shopping. I forgot.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.384
Hey, listen, I don't even
wanna have this conversation.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.972
I'm just from Philadelphia, you know.
I mean, we believe in God so, uh... OK?

16:56.139 --> 16:58.724
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?

16:58.892 --> 16:59.934
Well, that...

17:00.102 --> 17:02.144
"I'm from Philadelphia.
I believe in God."

17:02.312 --> 17:05.231
Does this make any sense to you?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.651
What a creep. Could you believe her?

17:08.819 --> 17:11.153
- I mean, she was really...
- She seemed nervous.

17:11.320 --> 17:12.864
Nervous? She was overbearing.

17:13.031 --> 17:16.242
She was, you know, terrible!
She was all cerebral.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.452
Where the hell
does a little Radcliffe tootsie

17:18.619 --> 17:20.663
come off rating Scott
Fitzgerald...

17:20.830 --> 17:24.166
...Gustav Mahler and Heinrich BÃ¶ll?
- Why are you getting so mad?

17:24.335 --> 17:27.921
Because I don't like that
pseudo-intellectual garbage.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.884
"Van Goch!" Did you hear that? She said
Van Goch. Like an Arab she spoke.

17:32.051 --> 17:36.847
One more remark about Bergman, and I'd
have knocked her other contact lens out.

17:37.015 --> 17:41.018
- Is she Yale's mistress?
- That will never cease to mystify me.

17:41.185 --> 17:46.189
I mean, he's got a wonderful wife and
he prefers to... to diddle this yo-yo.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.026
But he was always a sucker
for those kind of women.

17:49.193 --> 17:53.739
The kind that would involve him
in discussions of existential reality.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.159
They probably sit on the floor
with wine and cheese...

17:57.327 --> 18:00.746
...and mispronounce
"allegorical" and "didacticism".

18:00.914 --> 18:03.540
I get the feeling
that Yale really likes her.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.668
Well, I don't believe
in extramarital relationships.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.881
I think people should mate for life
like pigeons or Catholics.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.886
I don't know. Maybe people weren't
meant to have one deep relationship.

18:16.054 --> 18:20.308
Maybe we're meant to have a series
of relationships of different lengths.

18:20.476 --> 18:24.395
- That's gone out of date.
- Don't tell me what's gone out of date.

18:24.563 --> 18:28.107
You're 17. You were brought up
on drugs and television and the pill.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.818
I... I was World War II.
I was in the trenches.

18:30.986 --> 18:34.656
- You were eight in World War II.
- Right. I was never in the trenches.

18:34.823 --> 18:38.242
I was caught right in the middle.
It was a very tough position.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.453
Get the groceries, will you?

18:42.247 --> 18:45.291
Good morning
and welcome to Human Beings Wow!

18:45.459 --> 18:49.337
We're talking this evening with Gregory
and Caroline Payne Whitney Smith...

18:49.505 --> 18:51.506
...close friends of the Carter family.

18:51.674 --> 18:54.759
We're normal people.
Just like you, we're in debt.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.637
Except that Mrs. Payne Whitney Smith
is a catatonic.

18:57.805 --> 19:01.349
Well, we don't consider her
a catatonic, just quiet.

19:01.976 --> 19:05.979
Jesus, this is the worst.
This is really embarrassing to me.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.147
I mean, I... This is so antiseptic...

19:08.315 --> 19:11.985
No, wrong.
That's very chancy material.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.531
- How do you see this as chancy?
- Who fights more with the censor?

19:15.699 --> 19:19.910
What has the censor got to do with it?
There's no substance to the comedy.

19:20.078 --> 19:21.787
You don't find this insightful?

19:21.955 --> 19:24.164
Worse than not insightful.
It's not funny.

19:24.332 --> 19:27.084
- There's not a legitimate laugh.
- That's funny.

19:27.252 --> 19:30.629
- Look at the audience.
- You're going by audience reaction?

19:30.797 --> 19:32.798
This is an audience raised on TV.

19:32.966 --> 19:36.135
Their standards have been lowered
over the years.

19:36.302 --> 19:40.973
They watch their sets and the gamma rays
eat the white cells of their brains out.

19:41.141 --> 19:44.977
- I quit. I can't write this any more.
- Relax. Take a lude.

19:45.145 --> 19:50.024
I don't want a lude. All you do is drop
ludes, then Percodans and angel dust.

19:50.191 --> 19:54.111
Naturally, it seems funny.
Anything would if you're...

19:54.279 --> 19:58.032
You should abandon the show
and open a pharmaceutical house. I quit.

19:58.199 --> 19:59.992
Ike, you're being silly.

20:01.703 --> 20:04.204
We've talked to them about that.

20:04.372 --> 20:06.790
- Don't break her neck.
- I won't. That's fine.

20:06.958 --> 20:09.084
What did I do?
I made a terrible mistake.

20:09.252 --> 20:11.253
It's the first smart thing you've done.

20:11.422 --> 20:13.548
I've screwed myself up completely.

20:13.716 --> 20:18.470
For about 30 seconds I was a big hero,
and now it's directly to unemployment.

20:18.637 --> 20:20.847
If you need money, I'll take care of it.

20:21.015 --> 20:23.516
That's not the point.
I got enough for a year.

20:23.684 --> 20:26.561
If I live like Mahatma Gandhi, I'm fine.

20:26.729 --> 20:30.648
My accountant says I did this
at a very bad time. My stocks are down.

20:30.816 --> 20:33.902
I'm cash poor or something.
I got no cash flow.

20:34.070 --> 20:38.573
I'm not liquid, something's not flowing.
They got a language all their own.

20:38.741 --> 20:42.285
We discussed this. It's difficult
to live here without a big income.

20:42.453 --> 20:47.373
Yeah, plus I got two alimonies and child
support. You know, I gotta cut down.

20:47.541 --> 20:49.542
I'll have to give up my apartment.

20:49.710 --> 20:53.088
I'm not gonna be able to
play tennis, pick checks up at dinner...

20:53.255 --> 20:55.256
...or take the Southampton house.

20:56.967 --> 21:00.011
Oh! Plus I'll probably have
to give my parents less money.

21:00.179 --> 21:02.055
It'll kill my father.

21:02.223 --> 21:05.350
He's not gonna be able to get
as good a seat in the synagogue.

21:05.518 --> 21:08.437
He'll be in the back,
away from God, far from the action.

21:08.605 --> 21:10.606
Have you said anything to Tracy?

21:10.774 --> 21:13.692
I gotta get out of that situation.

21:13.860 --> 21:16.862
She's a young girl. What am I? I'm...

21:17.030 --> 21:19.907
You know, it's ridiculous. I mean, I...

21:20.784 --> 21:24.286
What happens if the year goes by
and my book doesn't come out?

21:24.454 --> 21:28.082
Your book is gonna come out.
Your book is gonna be wonderful.

21:28.250 --> 21:32.294
The worst thing that can happen is
you'll learn something about yourself.

21:32.462 --> 21:37.716
Listen, I'm really proud of you.
I mean, this is a very good move.

21:38.051 --> 21:40.302
This is a wonderful turnout.

21:40.971 --> 21:44.140
The Museum of Modern Art
has been very generous.

21:44.307 --> 21:47.726
And the proof of the strength
of the Equal Rights Amendment...

21:47.894 --> 21:51.230
...is that so many of you
who would never do it before

21:51.398 --> 21:53.107
put on black tie tonight.

21:56.611 --> 22:00.531
We love you for it.
We need you and you've come through.

22:00.699 --> 22:03.826
And now no more talk. Enjoy yourselves.

22:08.374 --> 22:10.500
Hi. What are you doing here?

22:10.668 --> 22:13.378
Congratulations on your book.
It was terrific.

22:13.546 --> 22:15.797
- Oh, thanks.
- Absolutely terrific.

22:15.965 --> 22:18.425
Listen, I'd like you
to meet Isaac Davis.

22:18.593 --> 22:20.552
Hi, how do you do? Isaac Davis.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.055
- Isaac, hello. Hi.
- Wh-what are you doing here?

22:24.223 --> 22:26.224
Well, of course I'm here.

22:26.392 --> 22:31.188
What a funny coincidence. Uh,
excuse me, Isaac Davis. We met before.

22:31.355 --> 22:34.274
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's all right.

22:34.901 --> 22:36.902
I heard you, uh, quit your job.

22:37.069 --> 22:41.156
Yeah. A real self-destructive impulse.
I wanna write a book, so I...

22:41.324 --> 22:45.327
Has anybody read that Nazis are gonna
march in New Jersey, you know?

22:45.494 --> 22:47.913
We should go there,
get some guys together.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.249
Get some bricks and baseball bats
and explain things to 'em.

22:51.417 --> 22:55.170
There was this devastating
satirical piece on that in the Times.

22:55.338 --> 22:57.672
Well, a satirical piece
in the Times is one thing,

22:57.840 --> 23:00.508
but bricks get right to the point.

23:00.676 --> 23:03.596
Aw, but biting satire
is better that physical force.

23:03.764 --> 23:06.474
No, physical force is better with Nazis.

23:06.642 --> 23:09.185
It's hard to satirize
a guy with shiny boots.

23:09.353 --> 23:12.855
- Well, you get emotional, but...
- We were talking about orgasms.

23:13.023 --> 23:15.858
- Oh, no, please!
- Really? I'm sorry. I didn't...

23:16.026 --> 23:19.445
I'm from Philadelphia. We never
talk about such things in public.

23:19.613 --> 23:22.740
You said that before.
I don't know what it meant then either.

23:22.908 --> 23:26.244
I'm just about to direct a film...
uh, of my own script.

23:26.411 --> 23:29.288
The premise is this guy
screws so great...

23:29.456 --> 23:31.666
- Screws so great?
- Screws so great...

23:31.833 --> 23:34.126
...that when he brings
a woman to orgasm, she's

23:34.294 --> 23:36.212
so fulfilled that she dies.

23:36.380 --> 23:39.465
Now this one, excuse me,
finds this hostile.

23:39.633 --> 23:43.052
It's worse than hostile.
It's aggressive-homicidal.

23:43.220 --> 23:47.348
You have to forgive Dennis.
He's Harvard direct to Beverly Hills.

23:47.516 --> 23:51.269
It's, uh, Theodor Reik
with a touch of Charles Manson.

23:52.771 --> 23:56.941
I finally had an orgasm and my doctor
told me it was the wrong kind.

23:58.027 --> 24:01.446
Did you have the wrong kind?
I've never had the wrong kind. Ever.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.991
My worst one was right on the money.

24:10.039 --> 24:12.374
Good night.
It was nice to meet you.

24:12.542 --> 24:13.542
Same here.

24:13.710 --> 24:15.460
Bye-bye.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.130
Oh, gee!

24:18.673 --> 24:22.467
It's an interesting group of people.
Like the cast of a Fellini movie.

24:22.635 --> 24:26.388
They're such fun, such wonderful people,
and Helen is a good friend.

24:26.556 --> 24:28.348
- She's a brilliant woman.
- Mm-hm.

24:28.516 --> 24:32.436
She's a genius. I met her through
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

24:32.603 --> 24:35.439
How come you guys got divorced?
I never...

24:35.606 --> 24:38.025
What do you mean
"How come we got divorced?"

24:38.192 --> 24:40.861
What kind of a question is that?
I hardly know you.

24:41.029 --> 24:43.030
You don't have
to tell me if you don't...

24:43.197 --> 24:45.949
Well, we had problems. We fought a lot.

24:46.117 --> 24:50.120
I was tired of submerging my identity
to a brilliant, dominating man.

24:50.288 --> 24:51.371
He's a genius.

24:51.539 --> 24:54.459
He was a genius,
Helen's a genius, Dennis is a genius.

24:54.626 --> 24:56.669
You know a lot of geniuses.

24:56.837 --> 24:59.881
You should meet some stupid people.
You could learn something.

25:00.049 --> 25:02.050
Well, why'd you get a divorce?

25:02.217 --> 25:06.929
Why? I got a divorce because my ex-wife
left me for another woman.

25:07.097 --> 25:08.681
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

25:08.849 --> 25:11.309
God, that must have been demoralizing.

25:11.477 --> 25:13.519
I took it well under the circumstances.

25:13.687 --> 25:14.729
Phew-wee.

25:14.897 --> 25:17.023
I tried to run 'em both over
with a car.

25:17.191 --> 25:19.025
That's incredible sexual humiliation.

25:19.193 --> 25:22.862
It's enough to turn you off women
and it accounts for the little girl.

25:23.030 --> 25:27.325
Hey, the little girl is fine. Jesus,
she's... What's with the little girl?

25:27.493 --> 25:31.662
Oh, sure. I understand, believe me.
16 years old, no possible threat at all.

25:31.830 --> 25:36.542
She's 17. She's gonna be eight...
Sometimes you have a losing personality.

25:36.710 --> 25:41.005
I'm honest. I say what's on my mind
and if you can't take it, then fuck off.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.842
I like the way you express yourself,
too. Pithy, yet degenerate.

25:45.010 --> 25:48.346
- You get many dates? I don't think so.
- No, I do. I actually do.

25:48.514 --> 25:50.599
I never thought I was very pretty.

25:50.767 --> 25:55.729
Oh, what is pretty anyway? I hate being
pretty. It's all so subjective anyway.

25:55.897 --> 25:59.566
The brightest men just drop dead
in front of a beautiful face.

25:59.734 --> 26:03.737
When you climb into the sack, if you're
a bit giving, they're so grateful.

26:03.905 --> 26:05.697
Yeah, I know I am.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.866
- D'you have kids?
- Me, yeah.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.160
He's being raised by two women.

26:10.328 --> 26:12.079
I think it works.

26:12.247 --> 26:15.082
They made some studies,
I read in a psychoanalytic quarterly.

26:15.250 --> 26:17.668
You don't need a male.
Two mothers are fine.

26:17.836 --> 26:21.505
Really? Because I feel
very few people survive one mother.

26:21.673 --> 26:25.926
Listen, I gotta get my dog. Wanna wait?
I gotta walk it. Are you in a rush?

26:26.094 --> 26:28.470
Oh, no, sure.
What kind of dog you got?

26:28.638 --> 26:30.222
The worst.

26:30.390 --> 26:33.725
It's a dachshund. You know,
it's a penis substitute for me.

26:33.893 --> 26:37.521
Oh, I would have thought then
in your case a Great Dane.

26:55.541 --> 26:58.626
-
- So, you serious with Yale or what?

26:58.794 --> 27:00.753
- Serious?
- Mm-hm.

27:00.921 --> 27:03.006
Well, he's married.

27:03.757 --> 27:07.302
Uh, I don't know. I guess
I should straighten my life out, huh?

27:07.470 --> 27:09.637
Donny my analyst always tells me...

27:09.805 --> 27:13.433
- You call your analyst Donny?
- Yeah. I call him Donny!

27:13.601 --> 27:18.188
I call mine Dr. Chomsky, you know.
He hits me with a ruler.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.899
Donny? That's first name.

27:21.066 --> 27:24.903
Donny says I get involved in situations
and that it's deliberate...

27:25.070 --> 27:28.156
...especially with
my ex-husband Jeremiah.

27:28.324 --> 27:30.116
I was his student and, um...

27:30.284 --> 27:33.495
- Really? You married your teacher?
- Yeah, of course.

27:33.662 --> 27:35.163
That's very, uh...

27:35.331 --> 27:37.207
He failed me
and I fell in love with him.

27:37.374 --> 27:38.833
Oh, that's perfect.

27:39.001 --> 27:41.753
I was sleeping with him
and he had the nerve to give me an F.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.714
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

27:43.882 --> 27:46.967
Not even an Incomplete, right?
Just a straight F?

27:47.135 --> 27:49.136
You got a good sense of humor.

27:49.304 --> 27:52.973
Hey, thanks! I don't need you
to tell me that, you know.

27:53.141 --> 27:55.476
I've been making good money
off it for years,

27:55.644 --> 27:57.436
till I quit my job to write this book.

27:57.604 --> 28:01.023
Now I'm very, very nervous about it,
you know, but...

28:01.608 --> 28:04.026
D'you wanna?
Oh, you don't have to pay.

28:04.194 --> 28:07.363
- Oh, that's OK.
- I'm serious! Wanna walk by the river?

28:07.531 --> 28:09.740
- You know the time?
- What do you mean?

28:09.908 --> 28:12.910
If I don't get at least 16 hours,
I'm a basket case.

28:13.078 --> 28:16.789
I'd like to hear about your book.
I really would. I'm quite a good editor.

28:16.957 --> 28:18.541
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

28:18.708 --> 28:21.961
Well, my book is about
decaying values. It's about...

28:22.128 --> 28:24.880
See, years ago I wrote
a short story about my mother

28:25.048 --> 28:27.091
called The Castrating Zionist...

28:27.259 --> 28:31.554
...and I wanna expand it into a novel.
I could talk about my book all night.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.152
Isn't it beautiful out?

28:46.320 --> 28:49.990
Yeah, it's really so pretty
when the light starts to come up.

28:50.157 --> 28:52.242
Mm, I know. I love it.

28:53.494 --> 28:57.914
Boy, this is really a great city.
I don't care what anybody says.

28:58.082 --> 29:00.584
It's really a knockout, you know.

29:04.589 --> 29:06.840
I think I better head back.

29:07.008 --> 29:09.926
I've got an appointment
with Yale for lunch later on.

29:32.283 --> 29:34.743
Mm, hi.

29:34.910 --> 29:36.996
No, no. No, I'm awake.

29:37.789 --> 29:41.459
Jesus, what are you...
What are you doing? It's 7: 15.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.295
Oh, yeah.

29:46.089 --> 29:47.965
Really?

29:48.592 --> 29:50.676
You did? At the museum?

29:50.844 --> 29:54.513
Yeah, well, she's very active
in the feminist movement.

29:55.015 --> 29:58.434
Uh, so you're gonna go
apartment hunting with Tracy?

30:00.020 --> 30:03.773
Yeah, well, you should be able
to find something. It's Isaac.

30:03.940 --> 30:06.859
Yeah, I don't think
you'll have any trouble.

30:07.027 --> 30:10.488
I knew you'd...
see she's a terrific woman,

30:10.656 --> 30:12.365
if you spent some time with her.

30:12.532 --> 30:16.160
You still feel the same way about her?

30:16.328 --> 30:18.245
'Cause you hadn't
mentioned it in a while.

30:18.413 --> 30:20.873
So you... Yeah. Mm-hm.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.837
Yeah, mm-hm, right. I know.

30:27.005 --> 30:29.298
She's great, I know. Great.

30:29.466 --> 30:31.717
So, uh... No, I gotta go
apartment hunting today.

30:31.885 --> 30:33.720
I have to get something cheaper.

30:33.888 --> 30:36.682
I can't keep living where I do.
It's just...

30:42.063 --> 30:44.606
- Isaac's terrific, isn't he?
- Mm, yeah.

30:44.774 --> 30:46.775
Said he had a great time with you.

30:46.943 --> 30:50.737
Really? That's good 'cause I always
think he's uncomfortable around me.

30:50.905 --> 30:52.906
Oh, come on.

30:53.074 --> 30:54.533
I missed you so much.

30:54.701 --> 30:57.994
Yale, this is ridiculous.
You're married.

30:58.162 --> 31:01.415
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like one of those women.

31:01.582 --> 31:03.583
It sounds terrible. I hate it.

31:03.751 --> 31:09.423
- Why don't I just move out?
- No! I don't wanna break up a marriage.

31:09.590 --> 31:12.217
Besides, I'm not looking
for any big involvement here.

31:12.385 --> 31:14.136
It's just... I don't...

31:14.303 --> 31:18.265
It's crazy. It's crazy. I think about
you when you're not around.

31:20.017 --> 31:22.686
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

31:22.854 --> 31:26.523
I just guess I should be seeing
someone who's not married.

31:26.691 --> 31:28.693
You're so beautiful. You make me crazy.

31:28.861 --> 31:30.278
Oh, Yale, please stop it.

31:30.446 --> 31:33.489
We're in Bloomingdale's
and someone's gonna see us.

31:33.657 --> 31:36.534
Did I tell you I may have
an interview with Borges?

31:36.702 --> 31:41.748
I told you that we met before. He seems
to feel very comfortable around me.

31:41.915 --> 31:46.544
- Let's go somewhere and make love.
- Not now! Not now, Jesus.

31:46.712 --> 31:50.798
Anyway, you've got a writing class in
an hour. Your students are gonna know.

31:50.966 --> 31:54.886
You're gonna have
this big grin on your face.

31:55.053 --> 31:56.637
And I don't wanna go to your house

31:56.805 --> 32:00.099
'cause I can't stand the dog
and the phone ringing.

32:00.267 --> 32:04.479
Can't you hold me? Does your love for me
always have to express itself sexually?

32:04.646 --> 32:09.400
What about other values like warmth
and spiritual contact? Hotel, right?

32:09.568 --> 32:11.652
Jesus, I'm a pushover!

32:14.114 --> 32:15.698
Oh, hi, Isaac.

32:15.866 --> 32:18.826
- Hi. Is Willie ready?
- Yeah. Come on in.

32:18.994 --> 32:20.995
He'll be right down.

32:21.163 --> 32:23.998
- How you been, Ike?
- Good. How you been?

32:24.166 --> 32:26.168
- I've been terrific.
- Yeah?

32:26.336 --> 32:30.130
Yeah. Been getting a lot of work done.
Things are going really well.

32:30.298 --> 32:34.218
- Want some coffee or something?
- Uh, no. How's Willie doing?

32:34.385 --> 32:38.055
Willie's fine. He's beginning
to show some real talent in drawing.

32:38.223 --> 32:41.391
Where does he get that?
'Cause you don't draw and I don't draw.

32:41.559 --> 32:42.935
I draw.

32:43.102 --> 32:46.522
Yeah, but there's no way that
you could be the actual father.

32:48.066 --> 32:50.317
I'm hoping you'll take Willie
on the 16th

32:50.485 --> 32:52.528
'cause Connie and I
want to go to Barbados.

32:52.695 --> 32:55.614
Are you still gonna
write that stupid book?

32:55.782 --> 32:57.616
I mean, are you serious about that?

32:57.784 --> 32:59.827
I'm very serious about it.
It's an honest book.

32:59.994 --> 33:02.037
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

33:02.205 --> 33:05.040
- Excuse me.
- Can I talk to you a minute? Excuse me.

33:05.208 --> 33:08.502
Here's what I still don't understand.
Where are you running?

33:08.670 --> 33:11.630
I can't understand
how you can prefer her to me.

33:11.798 --> 33:13.590
- You can't understand?
- No.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.551
You knew my history!

33:15.718 --> 33:20.180
I know. My analyst warned me, but you
were so beautiful I got another analyst.

33:20.348 --> 33:22.767
D'you think we can be
ever just friends?

33:22.935 --> 33:24.602
You're putting in all the details?

33:24.770 --> 33:27.564
No, not the part where
you tried to run her over with the car.

33:27.731 --> 33:30.149
Wha... I tried
to run her over with a car?

33:30.317 --> 33:33.820
What are you talking about? It was late.
You know I don't drive well.

33:33.988 --> 33:35.989
It was raining. It was dark.

33:36.156 --> 33:38.324
Why were you lurking outside the cabin?

33:38.492 --> 33:40.910
I was spying on you guys
'cause I knew what was happening.

33:41.078 --> 33:42.996
You were falling in love.

33:43.163 --> 33:45.748
So you felt you had to
run her over with the car?

33:45.916 --> 33:49.544
Do I look like that type of person?
You know how slowly I was going?

33:49.712 --> 33:52.714
Not slowly enough
that you didn't rip the front porch off.

33:52.882 --> 33:57.552
Get the kid. I can't... I can't have
this argument every time I come over.

34:34.382 --> 34:36.800
- You look funny in that jacket.
- I know.

34:36.967 --> 34:40.219
I had hoped for something
in the gabardine.

34:40.388 --> 34:42.598
- So, do you miss me?
- Yeah. Do you miss me?

34:42.766 --> 34:46.601
Of course I miss you. I love you. That's
why I come and get you all the time.

34:46.770 --> 34:51.023
- Why can't we have frankfurters?
- Because this is a Russian tearoom.

34:51.190 --> 34:55.194
I mean, you wanna have a blintz or
something. Frankfurter gives you cancer.

34:55.362 --> 34:59.865
Besides, you see those two women here?
They have very beautiful women here.

35:00.033 --> 35:01.575
We could do well.

35:01.743 --> 35:04.870
I think we could have picked up
these two, if you were quicker.

35:05.038 --> 35:07.122
I'm serious.

35:07.832 --> 35:10.125
I think the brunette liked you.

35:13.129 --> 35:16.383
I think I should, uh...
No, I'll call him.

35:21.639 --> 35:23.723
Mm...

35:26.727 --> 35:29.771
Hello, Yale? Um, I'm sorry for calling.

35:31.065 --> 35:33.400
Well, no, no, nothing's wrong. I...

35:34.485 --> 35:37.737
Well, I just thought
that it's Sunday out...

35:37.905 --> 35:43.159
...and maybe if you could get away,
we could go for a walk or... Mm.

35:43.327 --> 35:45.370
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

35:45.538 --> 35:47.163
Oh, that's right. You mentioned that.

35:47.331 --> 35:50.917
Well, OK, it was just a shot.
Yeah. Yeah.

35:51.085 --> 35:54.421
Well, I won't keep you. OK. Bye-bye.

36:00.302 --> 36:02.178
Hello?

36:02.805 --> 36:05.515
Oh, hi! Hi, how you doin'?

36:07.018 --> 36:09.144
No, not at all.
I was just sitting around

36:09.311 --> 36:12.148
looking through the magazine section.

36:13.150 --> 36:17.945
Uh, no, no, I didn't read the piece
on China's faceless masses.

36:18.113 --> 36:20.573
I was checking out the lingerie ads.

36:20.741 --> 36:23.743
Yeah, I can never get past them.
They're really erotic.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.995
You wanna go for a walk?

36:26.955 --> 36:28.539
I don't know, I've gotta get out.

36:28.707 --> 36:32.168
I'm going stir-crazy
and Yale's with Emily's parents.

36:32.335 --> 36:34.670
It's such a beautiful Sunday.

36:36.840 --> 36:40.092
It's an electrical storm.
You wanna wind up in an ashtray?

36:40.260 --> 36:42.887
- It was such a beautiful day out.
- Yeah, wonderful.

36:43.055 --> 36:45.264
I think the Chrysler Building blew up.

36:45.432 --> 36:49.310
- Oh, no! Thunder scares me.
- It's not my favorite sound either.

36:49.478 --> 36:51.645
D'you know every year
one or two people get killed

36:51.813 --> 36:54.148
during a storm in Central Park?

36:54.316 --> 36:56.942
Why don't I run up ahead
and we'll talk later?

37:11.793 --> 37:15.253
Jesus Christ, I'm soaking wet.
This is awful!

37:15.421 --> 37:17.506
You look ridiculous! You know that?

37:17.673 --> 37:21.259
Next time you want someone
to walk with you, get somebody else.

37:21.427 --> 37:25.055
I've never seen anybody react
so strongly to a little bit of water.

37:25.223 --> 37:27.849
It wasn't the water.
It was the electricity.

37:28.017 --> 37:31.436
I'll turn into a guy that sells
comics outside Bloomingdale's.

37:31.604 --> 37:34.731
What do you think? You think
I look terrible? How do I look?

37:34.899 --> 37:38.527
- I can't see.
- You should see your face!

37:38.694 --> 37:42.239
You look kinda nice, actually.
You're sort of pretty.

37:42.949 --> 37:45.951
- I'm really annoyed with Yale.
- Why?

37:46.119 --> 37:48.995
He was supposed to see me today
and then he couldn't.

37:49.163 --> 37:51.123
And I had tickets
to this Vivaldi concert.

37:51.290 --> 37:53.291
He had to cancel on me, of course.

37:53.459 --> 37:57.420
- That's what happens when...
- I know. You're having an affair.

37:57.588 --> 38:00.882
- What a terrible way to put it.
- Hey, I didn't put it that way.

38:01.050 --> 38:04.846
My husband, well, my ex-husband,
had an affair when we were married.

38:05.013 --> 38:07.723
- Really?
- Yeah. At least one that I know of.

38:07.891 --> 38:12.103
And I never mentioned anything because
I felt that I was deficient in some way.

38:12.271 --> 38:16.440
That I was bad in bed, not bright
enough, or physically unattractive.

38:16.608 --> 38:20.486
- But in the end he was just a louse.
- Yeah, I know. An intellectual louse.

38:20.654 --> 38:23.781
Oh, God, was he brilliant.
I was so crazy about him.

38:23.949 --> 38:26.868
Really opened me up sexually.
Taught me everything.

38:27.035 --> 38:29.120
Women found him devastating.

38:30.122 --> 38:32.331
Oh, look. There's Saturn.

38:32.499 --> 38:34.959
Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun.

38:35.127 --> 38:38.171
How many of the satellites
of Saturn can you name?

38:38.338 --> 38:43.301
There's Mimas, Titan, Dione.
Hyperion, of course. Uh...

38:43.468 --> 38:47.597
I can't name any of 'em and fortunately
they never come up in conversation.

38:47.764 --> 38:50.391
Facts.
I got a million facts at my fingertips.

38:50.559 --> 38:55.271
They mean nothing 'cause nothing worth
knowing is understood with the mind.

38:55.439 --> 38:58.649
Everything valuable enters
through a different opening...

38:58.817 --> 39:01.361
...if you'll forgive
the disgusting imagery.

39:01.529 --> 39:05.032
I don't agree at all. Where would
we be without rational thought?

39:05.200 --> 39:08.452
You... you...
you rely too much on your brain.

39:08.620 --> 39:11.413
The brain is the most overrated organ.

39:11.581 --> 39:15.167
I know. You probably think
I'm too cerebral.

39:15.335 --> 39:18.587
Well, you are, you know,
kind of on the brainy side.

39:18.755 --> 39:22.758
What's the difference what I think about
you? God knows what you think of me.

39:22.926 --> 39:24.927
You're fine. Are you kidding?

39:25.094 --> 39:29.014
You do have a tendency to get a little
hostile, but I find that attractive.

39:29.182 --> 39:32.684
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm glad you do.

39:32.852 --> 39:36.355
So, you think I have no feelings?
Is that it?

39:36.522 --> 39:41.193
Hey, wha... You're so sensitive, Jesus!
I never said that.

39:42.612 --> 39:45.739
I think you're...
I think you're terrific.

39:46.407 --> 39:50.869
Really, you know. I... I...
You're very insecure.

39:51.037 --> 39:53.747
I think you're wonderful, really.

39:54.499 --> 39:58.211
What do you think?
It's probably stopped raining out.

39:58.379 --> 40:01.256
You wanna grab a bite
or something like that?

40:02.258 --> 40:05.718
I gotta
see somebody this evening.

40:05.886 --> 40:07.512
I don't know if it's a great idea.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.223
Right. Well...
So what about sometime next week?

40:10.391 --> 40:13.726
I might give you a call,
if you have any free time?

40:13.894 --> 40:15.979
Uh...

40:17.481 --> 40:20.108
I'm not gonna have any free time

40:20.276 --> 40:23.111
'cause... I don't think
it's such a great idea.

40:23.279 --> 40:28.908
I'm working on this book and it,
you know, takes a lot of my energy up.

40:29.076 --> 40:31.035
OK. OK.

40:32.788 --> 40:37.458
Your parents were in a good mood.
I almost had a good time.

40:37.626 --> 40:41.045
- Who did you call after dinner?
- Oh, uh, David Cohen.

40:41.213 --> 40:44.090
He wants me to review the new book
on Virginia Woolf.

40:44.258 --> 40:47.176
Written another one,
if you can believe it.

40:47.970 --> 40:51.014
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine. What do you mean?

40:51.181 --> 40:54.893
- You seem sort of nervous.
- No, I'm not. I feel good.

40:55.061 --> 40:58.689
- I was gonna ask you how you felt.
- No. I'm OK.

40:58.857 --> 41:03.277
- You seemed strange at dinner.
- Ah, just more thoughts about kids.

41:03.445 --> 41:05.529
Oh, come on.

41:08.033 --> 41:12.244
Listen, I told Cohen I'd stop by and
pick up the book. Is that OK with you?

41:12.412 --> 41:14.204
Yeah.

41:14.539 --> 41:15.956
It's not too crowded.

41:16.124 --> 41:19.668
No, not bad for Sunday.
I thought it'd be jammed.

41:19.836 --> 41:21.879
Gee, I'm glad you could get out tonight

41:22.047 --> 41:25.257
'cause...
I really did wanna see you a lot.

41:25.425 --> 41:29.011
I like it when you get
an uncontrollable urge.

41:29.179 --> 41:31.263
Yeah, I know, it's my best feature.

41:31.431 --> 41:35.517
My boyish impetuosity.
It's my... You look adorable.

41:35.685 --> 41:37.686
So I have a chance to go to London...

41:37.854 --> 41:40.564
...study with the Academy
of Music and Dramatic Arts.

41:40.732 --> 41:42.524
Really? When did this happen?

41:42.692 --> 41:45.152
The other day.
Got a letter in the mail.

41:45.320 --> 41:48.530
Well, that's great. That's terrific.

41:48.698 --> 41:51.534
But I don't wanna go without you.

41:51.702 --> 41:53.953
Hey, I can't go to London and study.

41:54.121 --> 41:57.791
Especially Shakespeare.
You know, I don't look good in leotards.

41:57.958 --> 42:01.920
- I'm serious.
- Of course you should go. It's great.

42:02.088 --> 42:03.671
You'll have a great time.

42:03.839 --> 42:06.383
It's a great town
and you're a wonderful actress

42:06.550 --> 42:09.177
and it's a terrific place to study.

42:09.345 --> 42:12.931
You'll be the toast of the town.
You'll have a good time, really.

42:13.099 --> 42:16.810
- You shouldn't pass that...
- So what happens to us?

42:16.977 --> 42:19.938
Well, you know, we'll always have Paris.

42:20.106 --> 42:21.898
I'm kidding.

42:22.066 --> 42:25.235
What kind of question is that?
You can't think of that now.

42:25.403 --> 42:28.279
You won't take me seriously
just because I'm 17.

42:28.447 --> 42:32.617
Yeah, exactly, because you're 17.
I mean, it's ridiculous.

42:32.785 --> 42:35.412
You're 17 now.
When you're 36, I'll be...

42:36.664 --> 42:39.165
- Um...
- 63.

42:39.333 --> 42:41.543
63, right. Thank you.

42:41.710 --> 42:45.630
You know, it's absurd. You'll be
at the height of your sexual powers.

42:45.799 --> 42:48.050
Of course, I will too probably, but...

42:48.218 --> 42:50.302
...you know, I'm a late starter.

42:50.470 --> 42:52.471
- Who ordered the plain pie?
- Me.

42:52.639 --> 42:55.599
So you must be anchovies,
sausage, mushrooms, peppers.

42:55.767 --> 42:58.477
- Mm-hm.
- Forgot the coconut.

42:59.271 --> 43:00.771
So what do you wanna do tonight?

43:00.939 --> 43:04.942
We'll go to the movies,
I'll take you dancing...

43:05.110 --> 43:07.403
- Anything?
- Absolutely anything.

43:07.571 --> 43:09.572
OK, I know what we can do.

43:09.739 --> 43:11.574
Well, get the filthy look
off your face.

43:11.741 --> 43:14.076
Shut up. It's not filthy.

43:29.551 --> 43:34.221
This is so corny. I can't believe
this. Is this what you wanted to do?

43:34.389 --> 43:36.974
I don't think it's corny.
I think it's fun!

43:37.142 --> 43:39.810
It is fun, but I did this
when I was a kid, you know.

43:39.978 --> 43:42.772
Well, I've never done it.
I think it's great.

43:42.940 --> 43:47.235
On my prom night I went
around this park five times, six times.

43:47.403 --> 43:51.490
If I had been with a girl, this would
have been an incredible experience.

44:06.297 --> 44:09.007
Quit fighting it.
You know you're crazy about me.

44:09.175 --> 44:12.677
I am. You're...
You're God's answer to Job.

44:12.845 --> 44:15.555
You would have ended
all argument between them.

44:15.723 --> 44:17.891
He'd have said
"I do a lot of terrible things

44:18.059 --> 44:20.936
but I can also make one of these."

44:21.103 --> 44:23.813
And Job would've said "OK, you win."

44:34.659 --> 44:38.537
Look, this is crazy. I just can't do
this any more. It's really bullshit!

44:38.705 --> 44:42.041
You're married and
I expected to see you this weekend...

44:42.209 --> 44:45.294
...and I sit around like
I've nothing to do, so I called Isaac.

44:45.462 --> 44:46.671
We went for a walk.

44:46.838 --> 44:50.216
- It was just lucky he was free.
- I know. I'm sorry.

44:50.384 --> 44:54.387
Oh, it's not your fault.
What the hell. It's a no-win situation.

44:54.555 --> 44:57.682
It's just I'm beautiful and I'm bright
and I deserve better!

44:57.849 --> 44:59.141
I know.

44:59.309 --> 45:01.394
- What if I took some action?
- No!

45:01.562 --> 45:04.397
Oh. I'm not a home wrecker.

45:04.565 --> 45:07.984
I don't know how I got into this.
I guess we met at the wrong time.

45:08.151 --> 45:10.152
It happens. Hello?

45:10.320 --> 45:13.155
Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Harvey. How are you?

45:13.323 --> 45:15.324
Uh, what?

45:15.492 --> 45:20.705
Well, um, why don't you bring it by
on Thursday and I'll read it then, OK?

45:20.872 --> 45:26.168
Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. Right, I'll talk
to you later. OK, bye-bye.

45:26.336 --> 45:29.589
- What d'you want me to do?
- Waffles. Nothing. It's just...

45:29.756 --> 45:34.260
Waffles! Will you stop that now?
We're just going no place. Excuse me.

45:34.428 --> 45:36.346
Look, I know it's terrible.

45:36.514 --> 45:39.308
I'm at Sneedon's Landing
with Emily and her parents...

45:39.475 --> 45:43.020
...and I love her!
And I'm thinking about you all the time.

45:43.187 --> 45:46.857
Christ. I don't wanna hear it.

45:47.025 --> 45:50.193
I'm from Philadelphia.
My family's never had affairs.

45:50.361 --> 45:54.656
My parents have been married 43 years.
Nobody cheats at all. Hello?

45:54.824 --> 45:57.326
Oh, Donny. Hi!
It's my analyst.

45:57.493 --> 45:59.578
Hello. Uh...

46:00.455 --> 46:04.625
Um, no, uh... Well, I think
that'd be impossible. Uh...

46:04.792 --> 46:09.463
OK, well, probably later in the week.
OK, all right.

46:09.631 --> 46:12.257
I'll get back to you. OK, bye.

46:12.425 --> 46:14.926
Oh, man. Waffles!

46:15.094 --> 46:19.931
Please, just don't. This is really a bad
time... Waffles! ...a bad time for me.

46:21.059 --> 46:23.310
I gotta think things through here.

46:25.104 --> 46:28.774
- Obviously I shouldn't have come here.
- Well, no, probably not.

46:56.887 --> 46:59.972
Listen to that! How am I gonna?

47:00.140 --> 47:03.893
What is that sound? Can you hear that?
Listen. Where's it coming from?

47:04.061 --> 47:07.355
It's like somebody's
playing the trumpet.

47:07.523 --> 47:12.402
Or somebody sawing... Like a man
sawing a trumpet in half. Right? Right?

47:12.569 --> 47:14.737
- Let's fool around.
- You hear it?

47:14.905 --> 47:16.781
It'll take your mind off it.

47:16.949 --> 47:20.576
How many times a night? How often
can you make love in an evening?

47:20.744 --> 47:23.621
- Well, a lot.
- Yeah, I can tell. A lot. That's...

47:23.789 --> 47:26.874
Well, a lot is my favorite number.
Gee, really? Can you?

47:27.042 --> 47:30.212
Let's do it some strange way
you've always wanted to do...

47:30.380 --> 47:32.381
...but nobody would do with you.

47:32.549 --> 47:36.051
I'm shocked. What kind of talk
is that from a kid your age?

47:36.219 --> 47:39.263
I'll get my scuba-diving equipment
and really show you...

47:39.431 --> 47:42.391
- Take me seriously!
- I do take you seriously, but...

47:42.559 --> 47:44.017
Listen to this.

47:44.185 --> 47:46.019
Am I crazy? Wha...? Ah!

47:46.187 --> 47:47.604
It's a rumbling.

47:47.772 --> 47:50.399
Listen to that goddamn...
Where the hell is that coming from?

47:50.567 --> 47:55.946
- It's probably just the elevator shaft.
- It's not. It's coming from the walls.

47:56.114 --> 47:58.741
Let's... Let's...
Can we check into a hotel?

47:58.908 --> 48:01.660
- Oh, you're crazy!
- I can't sleep here. I can't.

48:01.828 --> 48:04.121
Where's the aspirin? What d'you do...

48:04.289 --> 48:07.207
I can help you fix this place up,
if you give me a chance.

48:07.375 --> 48:09.752
No, and I don't want you living here.

48:09.919 --> 48:14.006
Tonight is a special occasion.
It's my first night in the apartment...

48:14.174 --> 48:17.885
...so I wanted to break in the place
and I was afraid to sleep alone.

48:18.052 --> 48:21.054
Hey, what is this?
There's brown water!

48:21.222 --> 48:24.434
- The pipes are rusty.
- What is this, Tracy?

48:24.602 --> 48:28.062
- The pipes are rusty.
- Look at this. It's brown water.

48:28.230 --> 48:31.941
I'm paying $700 a month.
I got rats with bongos and a frog.

48:32.109 --> 48:34.110
And I got brown water here.

48:34.278 --> 48:37.280
- Look. It's disgusting.
- What's gonna happen to us?

48:37.448 --> 48:40.950
Listen. You keep ignoring me.
What's gonna happen with us?

48:41.118 --> 48:44.788
What do you mean?
D'you have a good time with me?

48:44.955 --> 48:48.833
- Aren't I a load of laughs and fun?
- Yes.

48:49.001 --> 48:51.336
So, and that's it, and we have fun.

48:51.504 --> 48:54.756
Then you're gonna go to London
exactly as we discussed it.

48:54.924 --> 48:59.427
You're gonna take advantage of that
opportunity and study acting over there.

48:59.595 --> 49:03.640
And you'll think of me always
as a fond memory. It'll be nice.

49:03.808 --> 49:06.476
You know we have to
stop seeing each other?

49:06.644 --> 49:09.062
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

49:09.230 --> 49:12.941
I understand. I could tell by
the sound of your voice over the phone.

49:13.108 --> 49:17.612
Very authoritative, you know.
Like the Pope or the computer in 2001.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.615
It's not fair to you
and I don't know what I'm doing.

49:20.783 --> 49:23.285
- Right.
- I mean... Come on, don't be angry.

49:23.453 --> 49:26.997
You brought this up. You're not happy
the way things are going.

49:27.165 --> 49:30.334
I'm not angry.
It's just I knew it was gonna end,

49:30.502 --> 49:32.878
but now it's happened I'm upset, OK?

49:33.046 --> 49:35.548
Look, you don't wanna
make a commitment.

49:35.715 --> 49:37.550
And I don't wanna break up my marriage

49:37.717 --> 49:40.135
and then find out
we're no good together.

49:40.303 --> 49:42.596
I've gotta start thinking about Emily.

49:42.764 --> 49:44.890
OK, you made your point very clear.

49:45.058 --> 49:47.893
I'm just glad one of us
had the nerve to end it.

49:48.770 --> 49:51.397
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah...

49:51.565 --> 49:54.942
Of course I will. What d'you think
I'm gonna do? Hang myself?

49:55.110 --> 49:58.529
I'm a beautiful woman.
I'm young, highly intelligent.

49:58.697 --> 50:01.407
I got everything going for me.
The point...

50:02.075 --> 50:06.620
The point is that... I don't know,
I'm all fucked up. I'm just... Shit!

50:06.788 --> 50:11.417
What am I doing in this relationship
anyway? My phone never stops ringing.

50:11.585 --> 50:15.546
I could go to bed with the entire
faculty of MIT, if I wanted to.

50:15.714 --> 50:16.922
It's just...

50:17.090 --> 50:20.302
I don't know. I'm wasting myself
on a married man, so I don't know.

50:22.013 --> 50:25.891
Listen, I think I'd better go now.
I just want you to have this.

50:26.058 --> 50:28.393
I got these tickets
to see Rampal tonight.

50:28.561 --> 50:30.729
Oh, Mary. This is very hard on me, too.

50:30.897 --> 50:33.481
Please! Just take them
and go with your wife.

50:33.649 --> 50:37.652
Mary, you love Rampal.
Call somebody up. Take Isaac.

50:37.820 --> 50:39.905
Fuck off, Yale!

50:41.073 --> 50:44.367
Um, I know you're gonna think
the water's a little brown,

50:44.535 --> 50:46.202
but you can drink it.

50:46.370 --> 50:48.371
Don't get thrown by this.

50:48.539 --> 50:51.499
- I'm really sorry for bothering you.
- No problem.

50:51.667 --> 50:52.751
It's just...

50:52.919 --> 50:56.880
- God, this is brown, isn't it?
- It is, but you get used to it.

50:57.048 --> 50:58.840
I didn't know who to call.

50:59.008 --> 51:01.885
I don't think you should take Valium.
It causes cancer.

51:02.053 --> 51:05.597
- No. Half a Valium?
- Yeah, abdominal cancer, I think.

51:05.765 --> 51:07.766
When did they find that out?

51:07.934 --> 51:11.937
That's just my theory, but I think
it's correct. I got tissues someplace.

51:12.104 --> 51:14.440
Well, I guess
I deserve everything I get.

51:14.608 --> 51:15.650
Come on.

51:15.817 --> 51:19.528
It's true. It's really true. I mean,
I knew it couldn't possibly work out.

51:19.696 --> 51:21.697
Yeah, you pick a married guy...

51:21.865 --> 51:25.493
...and when it doesn't work out,
it confirms your worst feelings.

51:25.661 --> 51:27.662
What worst feelings?

51:27.829 --> 51:32.833
You know. Your feelings about men
and marriage and that nothing works.

51:33.001 --> 51:36.545
Oh, please, don't psychoanalyze me.
I pay a doctor for that.

51:36.713 --> 51:40.967
Hey. You call that guy
that you talk to a doctor?

51:41.134 --> 51:46.764
You don't get suspicious when he calls
you at 3am and weeps into the telephone?

51:46.932 --> 51:49.767
So he's unorthodox.
He's a highly qualified doctor.

51:49.935 --> 51:51.602
He's done a great job on you.

51:51.770 --> 51:54.230
Your self-esteem is like
a notch below Kafka's.

51:54.398 --> 51:56.440
What is that noise?

51:56.608 --> 51:58.526
Yeah. Incredible, isn't it?

51:58.694 --> 52:01.070
There's a guy upstairs.
I don't know what the hell it is.

52:01.238 --> 52:05.241
It's like he's up there strangling a
parrot or something. I can't stand it.

52:05.409 --> 52:07.410
How can you stand it? It's terrible.

52:07.577 --> 52:09.578
I know.
I used to have a great apartment.

52:09.746 --> 52:14.126
- Wanna go for a walk? It's quieter out.
- No, I think I'll just go home.

52:14.293 --> 52:16.378
No, come on.

52:17.714 --> 52:21.800
He led me on! That's the point of it.
Why am I reluctant to criticize him?

52:21.968 --> 52:24.886
Relax. Yale would not do that.
He's not that kind of a guy.

52:25.054 --> 52:28.265
Don't defend him.
You guys all stick up for each other.

52:28.433 --> 52:31.601
Yale has his problems as we all do.

52:31.769 --> 52:34.104
I'm starting to sound
like Rabbi Blitzstein.

52:34.272 --> 52:38.358
Well, thanks for letting me come over.
I appreciate it. It's very nice of you.

52:38.526 --> 52:41.820
Tracy and I are going out tonight,
if you wanna come along.

52:41.988 --> 52:44.406
Oh, no, I'll be fine. I'll be OK.

52:44.574 --> 52:46.158
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:46.325 --> 52:50.746
- That's a healthy piece of towel paper.
- Oh, gee. God!

52:50.913 --> 52:52.998
Well, goodbye. Thanks a lot.

52:54.709 --> 52:58.420
But my point is a cab driver
doesn't make enough money...

52:58.588 --> 53:03.383
Oh, look at that... that guy's toupee.
That's unbelievable.

53:03.551 --> 53:08.514
That is hilarious. Mm, there's a... a...
an inch of cheesecloth. You can see it.

53:08.682 --> 53:12.185
I don't know why, you know,
his loved ones don't tell him.

53:12.352 --> 53:16.731
It's like the toupee dropped on his head
from a window ledge as he was walking.

53:16.899 --> 53:21.486
But look at his wife. Looks like her
face has been lifted about 8,000 times.

53:21.653 --> 53:24.739
I know. It's so plastic. It's so tight.

53:24.907 --> 53:27.325
I hate that. I just hate that. I wish...

53:27.493 --> 53:31.329
Why can't they just age naturally
instead of putting all that junk on?

53:31.497 --> 53:34.123
I know. Old faces are... are nice.

53:34.291 --> 53:36.501
Yeah. They're great.

53:36.668 --> 53:38.586
Mm... Mm...

53:38.754 --> 53:44.092
Hey, be careful. I think
I got black bean sauce in the bed.

53:44.259 --> 53:47.637
Oh, look. It's great.
The late show's a WC Fields film.

53:47.805 --> 53:49.972
Mm.

53:50.140 --> 53:52.225
Oh, great. We gotta watch that.

53:54.019 --> 53:55.853
Oh! Oh, God.

53:57.439 --> 54:00.900
Boy, I really feel good, you know.
I got my life together finally.

54:01.068 --> 54:02.443
Yeah?

54:02.611 --> 54:05.405
You know, I just had
to cut this thing off finally.

54:05.573 --> 54:07.699
I'm not the type for affairs.

54:07.867 --> 54:09.952
D'you ever hear from Mary, or see her?

54:10.120 --> 54:12.621
No. We cut it off.
It's easier that way.

54:12.789 --> 54:16.458
She's terrific. She deserves more
than a fling with a married guy.

54:16.626 --> 54:18.669
Yeah, she's screwed up, but great.

54:18.837 --> 54:21.463
Right up your alley.
You oughta call her.

54:21.631 --> 54:24.007
- I... I should call her?
- Yeah.

54:24.175 --> 54:26.677
- Why should I call her?
- Because she likes you.

54:26.845 --> 54:28.846
She told me she did.

54:29.013 --> 54:32.474
- You're crazy.
- No. She said she finds you attractive.

54:32.642 --> 54:35.519
- She said she found me attractive?
- Yeah.

54:35.687 --> 54:39.064
- When was this?
- She said it when she first met you.

54:39.232 --> 54:41.859
- I didn't know. I can't.
- Sorry about that.

54:42.026 --> 54:44.945
I always think of you guys together.
I couldn't...

54:45.113 --> 54:48.490
It's over. Unless you're serious
about Tracy. Are you?

54:48.658 --> 54:51.785
- No. Tracy's too young.
- Then call her up.

54:51.953 --> 54:56.915
Listen, she's an unhappy person.
I mean, she needs something in her life.

54:57.083 --> 54:59.084
I think you guys
would be good together.

54:59.252 --> 55:01.212
I could be a good influence on her.

55:01.380 --> 55:03.464
I think that under
my personal vibrations,

55:03.632 --> 55:06.676
I could put her life
in a kind of good order.

55:06.844 --> 55:12.098
That's what you said about Jill, and she
went from bisexuality to homosexuality.

55:12.266 --> 55:15.435
Yeah, but I gave it
the old college try there for a while.

55:15.603 --> 55:19.314
- Listen, you should call her up.
- No kidding. What did she say about me?

55:19.481 --> 55:23.151
She said that she likes you very much.
She thinks you're smart.

55:23.319 --> 55:25.862
- She thinks you're...
- Keep going. Don't stop.

55:26.030 --> 55:28.531
...attractive.
- Really? No kidding.

55:49.803 --> 55:52.931
You see, to me a great movie
is with WC Fields. That's what I like.

55:53.098 --> 55:54.682
Or Grand Illusion. That's...

55:54.850 --> 55:58.020
I see that every time it's on
television, if I'm aware of it.

55:58.188 --> 56:00.272
So what you got to eat here? Nothing.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.649
Oh, Jesus, what is this?

56:01.816 --> 56:05.486
You got a corned beef sandwich here
from 1951, I think.

56:05.654 --> 56:08.489
- Look at this. I mean...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

56:08.657 --> 56:12.117
- I don't have time to cook.
- Corned beef should not be blue.

56:12.285 --> 56:14.370
Ugh, it's really terrible.

56:14.537 --> 56:15.913
- Hey.
- What?

56:16.081 --> 56:17.748
Come here.

56:23.880 --> 56:25.673
What're you doing?

56:25.840 --> 56:29.802
What am I doing? You have to ask?
I was kissing you flush on the mouth.

56:29.970 --> 56:33.055
I... I cannot get my life
in any kind of order. It's just...

56:33.223 --> 56:35.224
It's something I wanted
to do for ages.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.558
Yeah, I know.

56:36.726 --> 56:40.980
Do you? I thought I was hiding it.
I was trying to be real cool and casual.

56:41.147 --> 56:43.732
I thought you wanted to kiss me
at the planetarium.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.901
- I did.
- I thought so.

56:46.069 --> 56:47.987
But you were going out with Yale then

56:48.154 --> 56:51.532
and I would never
in a million years interfere...

56:51.700 --> 56:53.702
Did you want me to kiss you?

56:53.869 --> 56:57.914
Mm, I don't know what I wanted.
I was so angry at Yale that day.

56:58.082 --> 57:01.334
But you were so sexy.
You were soaking wet from the rain...

57:01.502 --> 57:05.297
...and I had a mad impulse to throw you
down on the lunar surface...

57:05.464 --> 57:08.508
...and commit
interstellar perversion with you.

57:08.676 --> 57:11.469
I can't go from relationship
to relationship. It's senseless.

57:11.637 --> 57:13.430
I can't do it.

57:13.597 --> 57:16.891
Well, what... Are you still
hung up on Yale? Is that the problem?

57:17.059 --> 57:19.060
I've got too many problems.

57:19.228 --> 57:22.856
I'm really not the person
to get involved with. I'm trouble.

57:23.024 --> 57:27.485
- Hey, honey, Trouble is my middle name.
- What are you saying?

57:27.653 --> 57:30.155
Actually, my middle name is Mortimer.

57:30.323 --> 57:32.407
I'm... I'm kidding.

57:34.994 --> 57:38.371
My problem is I'm both attracted
and repelled by the male organ.

57:38.539 --> 57:39.831
Shh.

57:39.999 --> 57:43.168
So it doesn't make for
good relationships with men.

57:43.336 --> 57:45.754
What about your relationships
with women?

57:45.921 --> 57:48.966
You never really told me much
about your first wife.

57:49.134 --> 57:52.386
My first wife was
a kindergarten teacher, you know.

57:52.554 --> 57:56.057
She got into drugs
and she, uh, moved to San Francisco.

57:56.224 --> 57:58.225
Went into est, became a Moonie.

57:58.393 --> 58:00.728
She's with
the William Morris Agency now.

58:00.896 --> 58:02.480
D'you like that?

58:02.647 --> 58:06.484
This... this, I think, has a kind of
wonderful otherness to it, you know.

58:06.651 --> 58:09.445
- A marvelous negative capability.
- OK.

58:09.613 --> 58:12.531
Kind of wonderful energy to it,
don't you think?

58:19.790 --> 58:23.250
I thought that wine
was wonderful, didn't you think?

58:23.418 --> 58:26.420
And it just made my face
all flushed and hot.

58:26.588 --> 58:30.925
Yeah. You look so beautiful
I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.

58:31.093 --> 58:33.719
It's 14 bucks!

58:33.887 --> 58:36.931
I know, but it was a great restaurant.
Didn't you love it?

58:37.099 --> 58:41.519
Yeah, I love seafood. Course I'm drunk.
I don't know if you can tell or not.

58:41.686 --> 58:43.687
Hey, you know,
it was the only time in my life

58:43.855 --> 58:45.774
I ever had Chianti from Warsaw.

58:45.942 --> 58:47.818
- Give me a kiss.
- OK.

58:55.326 --> 58:58.870
What are you thinking?

58:59.038 --> 59:02.290
I was thinking there must be
something wrong with me...

59:02.458 --> 59:05.001
...because I've never
had a relationship...

59:05.169 --> 59:08.839
...that's lasted longer than
the one between Hitler and Eva Braun.

59:09.006 --> 59:11.133
I think you're still drunk!

59:50.924 --> 59:53.092
It's great. It's... it's...

59:53.260 --> 59:58.264
I don't play the harmonica, but it's an
incredible... harmonica is what it is.

59:58.932 --> 01:00:03.686
Well, you said you wanted to learn.
I'm trying to open up that side of you.

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:07.815
Tracy, you're throwing away
an enormous amount of real affection...

01:00:07.983 --> 01:00:09.984
...on the wrong person.

01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:12.236
It's not wrong for me.

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:20.578
Listen, I don't... I don't think
we should keep seeing each other.

01:00:20.746 --> 01:00:22.747
Why not?

01:00:22.915 --> 01:00:26.542
Because I think you're getting
too hung up on me, you know?

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.295
"Hung up on me."
I'm starting to sound like you.

01:00:29.463 --> 01:00:31.797
I'm not hung up on you.
I'm in love with you.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:34.467
You can't be in love with me.
We've been over this.

01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:38.347
You're a kid. You don't know what
love means. I don't know what it means.

01:00:38.515 --> 01:00:40.724
Nobody knows what the hell's going on.

01:00:40.892 --> 01:00:43.519
We have laughs together.
I care about you.

01:00:43.686 --> 01:00:46.522
Your concerns are my concerns.
We have great sex.

01:00:46.689 --> 01:00:48.732
You... But you're 17 years old.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.569
By the time you're 21,
you'll have a dozen relationships...

01:00:52.737 --> 01:00:55.447
...believe me,
far more passionate than this one.

01:00:55.615 --> 01:00:57.991
Well, don't you love me?

01:01:00.912 --> 01:01:03.664
The truth is that I love somebody else.

01:01:07.043 --> 01:01:09.127
You do?

01:01:10.463 --> 01:01:12.756
Hey, come on... We... we...

01:01:12.924 --> 01:01:16.593
This was supposed to be
a temporary fling. You know that.

01:01:17.303 --> 01:01:19.471
You met someone?

01:01:19.639 --> 01:01:22.182
Don't stare at me with those big eyes.

01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:27.271
You look like one of those barefoot kids
from Bolivia who needs foster parents.

01:01:27.438 --> 01:01:29.439
Have you been seeing someone?

01:01:29.607 --> 01:01:32.067
No. Yes. Someone older.

01:01:32.235 --> 01:01:34.403
I mean, y-y-you know, y-y-you know.

01:01:34.572 --> 01:01:38.449
Not as old as I am,
but in the same general ballpark as me.

01:01:40.119 --> 01:01:42.203
Gee, now I don't feel so good.

01:01:42.997 --> 01:01:46.457
It's not right.
You shouldn't get hung...

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:48.793
I mean, you should open up your life.

01:01:48.961 --> 01:01:50.962
You know, you've got to.

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:53.506
You state it like it's to my advantage,

01:01:53.674 --> 01:01:55.675
when it's you that wants
to get out of it.

01:01:55.843 --> 01:01:59.053
Hey, don't be so precocious, OK?
I mean, don't be so smart.

01:01:59.221 --> 01:02:01.347
I'm 42. My hair's falling out.

01:02:01.515 --> 01:02:03.641
I'm starting to lose
some hearing in my right ear.

01:02:03.809 --> 01:02:05.226
Is that what you want?

01:02:05.394 --> 01:02:09.772
I can't believe that you met somebody
that you like better than me.

01:02:11.942 --> 01:02:14.485
Why should I feel guilty about this?

01:02:14.653 --> 01:02:18.281
I've always encouraged you
to go out with guys more your own age.

01:02:18.449 --> 01:02:22.785
Kids from your class.
Billy and Biff and Scooter.

01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:26.706
And, you know, little Tommy or Terry.

01:02:26.874 --> 01:02:29.375
Hey, come on, don't cry.

01:02:31.671 --> 01:02:33.672
Don't cry.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.674
Come on, don't cry.

01:02:35.842 --> 01:02:40.220
Tracy... Tracy, don't...
Come on. Don't cry, Tracy.

01:02:40.972 --> 01:02:44.099
- Tracy...
- Just leave me alone.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.313
Tracy, come on, don't...

01:02:49.481 --> 01:02:51.565
Leave me alone.

01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:51.626
- That was wonderful.
- I'll say.

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:55.130
- I love being in the country.
- Mm, it's very relaxing.

01:03:55.297 --> 01:04:00.051
The mosquitoes have sucked all the blood
out of my left leg. Apart from that...

01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:03.680
- Doesn't it make you feel better?
- Yeah, you were dynamite...

01:04:03.848 --> 01:04:06.850
...except I felt for about
two seconds you were faking.

01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:08.601
- Not a lot.
- No.

01:04:08.769 --> 01:04:12.313
Yes. When you dug your nails
into my neck, you were a little...

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.774
Well, I guess I'm nervous around you.

01:04:14.942 --> 01:04:17.152
- Still?
- Well, yeah.

01:04:17.319 --> 01:04:18.361
So crazy.

01:04:18.529 --> 01:04:20.572
Because I'd like
everything to work out.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:24.660
It will. You should leave everything
to me. I'll make everything happen.

01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:26.829
- D'you really promise?
- Mm-mm.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:29.457
Because I like you.
I feel good around you.

01:04:29.624 --> 01:04:31.417
I don't blame you.

01:04:31.585 --> 01:04:36.297
Yeah, I mean... Yale was great, he was
absolutely great, but he was married.

01:04:36.465 --> 01:04:38.632
And Jeremiah, my ex-husband.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.844
He was just this oversexed,
brilliant kind of animal.

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:45.681
- Hey, what am I? Grandma Moses?
- Not at all. No, no, no.

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:48.559
- You're much different.
- Yeah?

01:04:48.727 --> 01:04:52.188
Yes. You're someone
I could imagine having children with.

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:53.522
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.941
Hit the lights. Go ahead. Turn 'em out.

01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:58.194
We'll trade fours.

01:05:59.048 --> 01:06:01.091
Well, we never see you any more.

01:06:01.259 --> 01:06:03.677
'Cause I'm working on my book.
I'm submerged.

01:06:03.845 --> 01:06:07.347
- It's that girl. Serious, isn't it?
- Well, serious, you know.

01:06:07.515 --> 01:06:11.226
When are we gonna get to meet her?
I'm sure Yale'd like to meet her.

01:06:11.394 --> 01:06:13.228
We should go out sometime.

01:06:13.396 --> 01:06:16.732
I don't understand. Why does he
need a car? A sudden urge.

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.693
He just wants it.

01:06:18.861 --> 01:06:22.905
What? Is there nothing I can do
to dissuade you from this?

01:06:23.073 --> 01:06:28.077
It's so crazy. They should ban all cars
from Manhattan. I mean, this is crazy.

01:06:28.245 --> 01:06:31.914
Listen, Emily wants to know
why I never bring Mary around.

01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:34.083
Why not bring Mary around?

01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:37.295
- I don't know. Is it awkward for you?
- Are you kidding?

01:06:37.462 --> 01:06:40.047
I spoke to her. It's no problem for her.

01:06:40.215 --> 01:06:42.008
- Then why not?
- Well, you know.

01:06:42.175 --> 01:06:46.178
Hey, don't get this thing. I hate cars.
It screws up the environment.

01:06:46.346 --> 01:06:48.347
- This is a work of art.
- Yeah.

01:06:48.515 --> 01:06:50.099
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:50.267 --> 01:06:54.312
- This is Emily.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

01:06:54.479 --> 01:06:56.564
- This is Yale.
- Hi, Yale.

01:06:57.441 --> 01:06:59.317
So, shall we go?

01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:03.154
- Yeah, let's go.
- Sure.

01:07:48.034 --> 01:07:51.119
Look at that.
That building is almost torn down.

01:07:51.287 --> 01:07:53.872
Can't they have those things
declared landmarks?

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.166
Yeah, I once tried to block demolition.

01:07:56.334 --> 01:08:00.587
Getting some people to lay in front of a
building, and a cop stepped on my hand.

01:08:00.755 --> 01:08:03.173
The city's really changing.

01:08:04.133 --> 01:08:08.428
I need something for round the house
that doesn't make me look too Mexican.

01:08:08.596 --> 01:08:09.973
Ugh, this is...

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.351
- Mary?
- Oh, my God. Jeremiah. Well...

01:08:13.519 --> 01:08:15.728
- Hi.
- Um...

01:08:15.896 --> 01:08:18.272
Jeremiah,
this is my friend Isaac Davis.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.899
Hi. Glad to meet you.

01:08:20.067 --> 01:08:22.484
- God, this is incredible.
- Incredible.

01:08:22.653 --> 01:08:26.029
I'm in town for a few days.
There's a symposium on semantics.

01:08:26.198 --> 01:08:28.116
- Well...
- And you're looking so great.

01:08:28.283 --> 01:08:29.575
I just, uh...

01:08:29.743 --> 01:08:34.037
- You. You're so thin. You lost weight.
- Well, I have an exercise machine.

01:08:34.206 --> 01:08:36.749
Well, you really look good. Really good.

01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:41.629
God. Well, I'm a bit late,
but it's just so nice seeing you.

01:08:41.796 --> 01:08:44.799
- It's great seeing you.
- I read an article by you...

01:08:44.966 --> 01:08:46.968
...on Brecht.
- Oh, shit! I know.

01:08:47.136 --> 01:08:50.054
I always was a sucker
for Germanic theatre.

01:08:50.221 --> 01:08:52.223
- Well...
- God.

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:56.310
- OK. Well, God... OK. So long.
- Bye. Bye, Jeremiah.

01:08:56.478 --> 01:08:58.563
Bye. Bye.

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:03.151
God, what a surprise.
I cannot get over it. My ex-husband.

01:09:03.318 --> 01:09:06.529
And he really does look a lot thinner.
He looks great.

01:09:06.698 --> 01:09:10.783
You certainly fooled me. I was shocked
'cause that's not what I expected.

01:09:10.952 --> 01:09:12.828
- What did you expect?
- I don't know.

01:09:12.996 --> 01:09:15.413
You had always led me to...

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:19.042
You said he was a ladies' man,
that he opened you up sexually.

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:20.461
So? So?

01:09:20.627 --> 01:09:23.589
Then this little homunculus,
you know...

01:09:24.131 --> 01:09:26.675
He's quite devastating.

01:09:26.843 --> 01:09:28.426
Really?

01:09:28.595 --> 01:09:32.139
Well, it's... it's amazing
how subjective all that stuff is.

01:09:32.307 --> 01:09:34.099
I don't know what you're...

01:09:36.227 --> 01:09:39.395
- Boy, you're really typing away.
- Yeah, it's a cinch.

01:09:39.564 --> 01:09:41.564
You still reviewing Tolstoy?

01:09:41.733 --> 01:09:45.152
No, no, I finished that two days ago.
I'm on that novelization.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:49.073
What... what do you waste your time
with a novelization for?

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.825
Why? Because it's easy and it pays well.

01:09:51.993 --> 01:09:56.580
It's like another contemporary American
phenomenon that's truly moronic.

01:09:56.748 --> 01:10:00.417
The novelizations of movies.
You're much too brilliant for that.

01:10:00.585 --> 01:10:03.922
You should be doing other stuff.

01:10:05.257 --> 01:10:07.050
- Like what?
- Fiction.

01:10:07.218 --> 01:10:09.177
I've seen your fiction.
It's terrific.

01:10:09.345 --> 01:10:10.720
Hello?

01:10:10.888 --> 01:10:12.972
Mary, hi. It's Yale.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.517
I was hoping you'd pick up.

01:10:15.684 --> 01:10:17.769
Listen, could we meet for coffee?

01:10:17.937 --> 01:10:20.188
Well, why? What is it?

01:10:20.356 --> 01:10:24.734
Well, you know, I miss you.
I just thought maybe we could talk.

01:10:24.902 --> 01:10:27.237
No, I don't think
that would be possible.

01:10:27.404 --> 01:10:29.489
I don't think that would be
possible at all.

01:10:29.657 --> 01:10:33.201
I'm sorry, I just, uh...
No, I... I'm sorry. I gotta go.

01:10:38.499 --> 01:10:40.708
- Who was that?
- What?

01:10:40.876 --> 01:10:42.877
Who was that on the phone just now?

01:10:43.045 --> 01:10:47.006
- Uh, dance lessons.
- Dance lessons that was?!

01:10:48.342 --> 01:10:50.677
Yeah. Do we want free dance lessons?

01:10:51.679 --> 01:10:57.100
Right. They give you one free lesson,
then they hook you for $50,000 worth.

01:11:04.401 --> 01:11:07.736
Viking loved my book.
They loved the first four chapters...

01:11:07.904 --> 01:11:10.489
...and, you know,
they were really complimentary.

01:11:10.657 --> 01:11:13.409
Yale had read them
and thought they showed promise.

01:11:13.577 --> 01:11:16.370
But Yale's family,
so of course he's encouraging.

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:18.747
But Viking will shell out the money.

01:11:18.915 --> 01:11:21.375
Maybe it'll inspire Yale
to finish his book.

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:24.044
He's been talking about it long enough.

01:11:24.212 --> 01:11:28.883
Mary read the stuff and she was laughing
out loud. I respect her judgment.

01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:31.468
Although she's doing
a think piece on...

01:11:31.636 --> 01:11:32.761
Hello?

01:11:32.929 --> 01:11:36.348
Hey, where were you? You were
supposed to be home an hour ago.

01:11:36.516 --> 01:11:39.727
- Uh... I bought the car.
- Oh, no. You did?

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:43.022
I know it's a meaningless extravagance,
but I had to have it.

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:45.191
- That thing we saw?
- Yeah.

01:11:45.358 --> 01:11:48.861
Did you hear Viking Press loved
the first four chapters of Ike's book?

01:11:49.029 --> 01:11:51.030
- Great!
- They were real complimentary.

01:11:51.198 --> 01:11:53.574
Next week I get the car
and we'll celebrate.

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:55.493
- OK.
- In our new car.

01:12:48.422 --> 01:12:50.632
Jesus, listen to this.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:54.762
"Making love to this
deeper, more masterful female...

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:57.932
...made me realize
what an empty experience...

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.394
...what a bizarre charade
sex with my husband was."

01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:04.522
Please. That is so nauseating. I... Oh!

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:07.733
Is this true? Did you make love
with Jill and a woman?

01:13:07.901 --> 01:13:09.902
She put that in?

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:13.489
Christ! She wanted to, I think.
I didn't wanna be a bad sport.

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:16.325
- Did you have a good time?
- No, I didn't.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:19.453
Did you hear the one
where he tried to run her lover over?

01:13:19.621 --> 01:13:21.956
- Oh, yeah.
- Whose side are you on?

01:13:22.124 --> 01:13:25.584
I didn't try and run her over.
It was raining. The car lurched.

01:13:25.752 --> 01:13:29.839
Jesus, now everybody in town
is gonna know all these details.

01:13:30.007 --> 01:13:32.341
Everybody... All my friends and...

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:36.721
Listen. "He was given to fits
of rage, Jewish, liberal paranoia...

01:13:36.888 --> 01:13:39.724
...male chauvinism,
self-righteous misanthropy...

01:13:39.891 --> 01:13:42.059
...and nihilistic moods of despair."

01:13:42.227 --> 01:13:45.271
"He had complaints about life,
but never solutions."

01:13:45.439 --> 01:13:49.067
"He longed to be an artist,
but balked at the necessary sacrifices."

01:13:49.235 --> 01:13:52.446
"In his most private moments,
he spoke of his fear of death...

01:13:52.613 --> 01:13:57.284
...which he elevated to tragic heights
when, in fact, it was mere narcissism."

01:13:57.452 --> 01:14:01.038
- I came here to strangle you.
- Nothing I wrote was untrue.

01:14:01.205 --> 01:14:03.415
You make me out to be
Lee Harvey Oswald!

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:05.375
It's an honest account.

01:14:05.543 --> 01:14:08.128
- That I'm narcissistic?
- You're self-obsessed.

01:14:08.296 --> 01:14:12.299
- Misanthropic and self-righteous?
- I wrote some nice things about you.

01:14:12.467 --> 01:14:14.259
Like what? What?

01:14:14.427 --> 01:14:16.511
You cry when you see
Gone With The Wind.

01:14:16.679 --> 01:14:19.598
What are you laughing about?

01:14:19.766 --> 01:14:23.477
- You let her write that garbage?
- Wait. This is between you two.

01:14:23.644 --> 01:14:26.438
D'you honestly think
that I tried to run you over?

01:14:26.606 --> 01:14:29.858
You just happened to hit the gas
as I walked in front of the car.

01:14:30.026 --> 01:14:33.195
- Did I do it on purpose?
- Well, what would Freud say?

01:14:33.363 --> 01:14:36.615
That I really wanted to run her over.
That's why he was a genius.

01:14:36.783 --> 01:14:39.284
Listen, I'm going upstairs.
I got work to do.

01:14:39.452 --> 01:14:42.204
Don't forget
that Willie's at ballet class.

01:14:42.372 --> 01:14:44.414
Look, I better warn you.

01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:48.127
I've had some interest in this book
for a movie sale.

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:53.424
- Anybody home?
- Uh-huh.

01:14:53.592 --> 01:14:58.513
Yeah? I got an unbelievable story to
tell you. Absolutely incredible. You OK?

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.264
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

01:15:00.432 --> 01:15:03.935
Just let me get one glass of brown water
'cause I'm dying of thirst.

01:15:04.103 --> 01:15:08.272
- Isaac, I wanna talk to you first.
- Mm-mm. So I go over to Jill's today...

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.443
...because I'm real annoyed over that
junk she printed in the book. And...

01:15:12.611 --> 01:15:16.489
Isaac, before you get wound up,
there's something I wanna tell you.

01:15:16.657 --> 01:15:19.867
- What's the matter? You look pale.
- Well...

01:15:22.496 --> 01:15:24.789
Wh... What's the matter?

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:29.460
Hey, what... Is there something wrong?
What is it?

01:15:34.883 --> 01:15:37.385
I think I'm still in love with Yale.

01:15:43.852 --> 01:15:45.936
What?

01:15:47.063 --> 01:15:49.356
You... Are you kidd?

01:15:51.359 --> 01:15:54.069
- You are?
- Yes.

01:15:55.155 --> 01:15:57.865
Well, when did this happen? What...

01:15:58.992 --> 01:16:01.243
Well, you are or you think you are?

01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:03.871
I started seeing him again.

01:16:04.038 --> 01:16:06.123
When? Since when?

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:11.879
Just since today. I mean,
that's why I wanted to be open about it.

01:16:13.548 --> 01:16:16.550
Jesus, I'm... I'm shocked.

01:16:16.718 --> 01:16:21.305
I'm... I'm shocked. I'm surprised.

01:16:21.473 --> 01:16:24.766
I think I've always
been in love with him.

01:16:24.934 --> 01:16:27.019
How does he feel about this?

01:16:27.187 --> 01:16:29.062
Well...

01:16:30.064 --> 01:16:33.650
He wants to move out of his place
so that we can live together.

01:16:33.818 --> 01:16:37.405
I'm stunned.
I mean, I'm in a state of, uh...

01:16:37.573 --> 01:16:40.783
Somebody should throw a blanket
over me. You know, I'm...

01:16:40.951 --> 01:16:44.829
Well, you see, he called me several
times in a very depressed state...

01:16:44.997 --> 01:16:47.207
...and he still loves me.

01:16:47.374 --> 01:16:51.961
This is shaping up like a Noel Coward
play. Somebody should go make martinis.

01:16:52.129 --> 01:16:54.547
I don't blame you
for being furious with me.

01:16:54.715 --> 01:16:56.716
I'm too stunned to be furious.

01:16:56.884 --> 01:16:58.176
Well, then I wish you would.

01:16:58.344 --> 01:17:01.346
I wish you'd get angry
so that we could have it out.

01:17:01.514 --> 01:17:03.932
I don't get angry.
I tend to internalize.

01:17:04.099 --> 01:17:08.436
I can't express anger. That's one of the
problems I have. I grow a tumor instead.

01:17:08.604 --> 01:17:11.856
Well, I told you that
I was trouble from the beginning,

01:17:12.024 --> 01:17:13.608
from when we started dating.

01:17:13.776 --> 01:17:16.027
So what does your analyst say?

01:17:16.195 --> 01:17:19.405
Donny's in a coma.
He had a very bad acid experience.

01:17:19.573 --> 01:17:23.076
Oh, that's gr... That's great.
I mean, you know...

01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:25.537
I think you're making
a big mistake here.

01:17:25.704 --> 01:17:26.829
Why?

01:17:26.997 --> 01:17:29.999
Why? Because you... Why?
Because you're preferring Yale to me.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:33.545
I know that sounds egotistical,
but, uh, you know...

01:17:33.712 --> 01:17:37.299
This guy's been married 12 years.
What do you think will happen?

01:17:37.467 --> 01:17:40.386
He'll be away from her for a month,
he'll go crazy.

01:17:40.554 --> 01:17:44.515
And if he does commit to you, when you
start to feel secure, you'll drop him.

01:17:44.683 --> 01:17:47.518
I know it.
I give the whole thing... four weeks.

01:17:47.686 --> 01:17:50.312
I can't plan that far in advance.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.691
- You can't plan four weeks in advance?!
- No!

01:17:53.858 --> 01:17:56.443
What kind of foresight is that?

01:17:56.611 --> 01:18:00.614
Jesus. You know, I knew you were crazy
when we started going out.

01:18:00.782 --> 01:18:02.908
You always think
that you're gonna be the one

01:18:03.076 --> 01:18:05.786
that makes 'em act different, but...

01:18:05.954 --> 01:18:08.539
Isaac, I'm sorry.
I really am. I'm really sorry.

01:18:08.707 --> 01:18:10.916
Mm-mm. Oh, well, I'm...

01:18:11.084 --> 01:18:13.794
I'm sorr... Where are you going?

01:18:13.962 --> 01:18:16.046
- I gotta get some air.
- Oh.

01:18:54.462 --> 01:18:56.046
What are you doing here?

01:18:56.213 --> 01:18:58.423
I spoke to Mary. Were you gonna tell me?

01:18:58.591 --> 01:19:00.925
I was, but...
I'm trying to teach a class.

01:19:01.093 --> 01:19:02.844
So where can we go and talk?

01:19:03.012 --> 01:19:05.889
- How'd you get past the security?
- I walked right past.

01:19:06.057 --> 01:19:09.225
What are you telling me?
That you're gonna leave Emily...

01:19:09.393 --> 01:19:12.062
...and run away with
the... the winner of the...

01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:14.856
...Zelda Fitzgerald
Emotional Maturity Award?

01:19:15.024 --> 01:19:16.816
Look, I love her.

01:19:16.984 --> 01:19:20.904
- What kind of crazy friend are you?
- A good friend. I introduced you two.

01:19:21.072 --> 01:19:23.907
- Why? What was the point?
- 'Cause I thought you liked her!

01:19:24.075 --> 01:19:27.745
- I do! Now we both like her!
- Yeah, well, I liked her first.

01:19:27.913 --> 01:19:32.917
"I liked her first."
What are you, six years old? Jesus!

01:19:33.085 --> 01:19:37.380
Look, would I have encouraged you
to take her out if I still liked her?

01:19:37.547 --> 01:19:39.757
So you liked her?
Now you don't like her?

01:19:39.925 --> 01:19:43.344
It's early. You can change your mind
one more time before dinner.

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:46.347
Don't get sarcastic about this.
You think I like this?

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:49.350
How long were you gonna see her
without telling me?

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:53.104
Don't turn this into
one of your big moral issues.

01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:57.274
You could've said, but you... All you
had to do was call me and talk to me.

01:19:57.442 --> 01:20:01.112
I'm understanding. I'd have said no,
but you'd have felt honest.

01:20:01.279 --> 01:20:04.865
I wanted to tell you about it.
I knew it would upset you. I...

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:07.243
We had a few innocent meetings.

01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:12.331
A few? She said one. You guys should get
your story straight. Don't you rehearse?

01:20:12.499 --> 01:20:14.583
We met twice for coffee.

01:20:14.751 --> 01:20:16.752
Hey, she doesn't drink coffee.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.295
Did you meet for Sanka?

01:20:18.463 --> 01:20:21.173
That's not too romantic.
A little on the geriatric side.

01:20:21.341 --> 01:20:22.925
I'm not a saint, OK?

01:20:23.093 --> 01:20:25.721
You're too easy on yourself.
Don't you see?

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:30.392
You're... You rationalize everything.
You're not honest with yourself.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.644
You talk about you wanna write a book,

01:20:32.812 --> 01:20:35.021
but in the end
you'd rather buy a Porsche.

01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:39.526
You cheat a little bit on Emily
and you play around the truth with me.

01:20:39.694 --> 01:20:43.989
The next thing you know you're in front
of a Senate committee naming names.

01:20:44.157 --> 01:20:45.949
You are so self-righteous.

01:20:46.117 --> 01:20:50.245
I mean, we're just people. We're just
human beings. You think you're God!

01:20:50.413 --> 01:20:53.582
I gotta model myself after someone.

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:57.043
You just can't live the way you do.
It's all so perfect.

01:20:57.211 --> 01:21:00.630
Jesus, what are future generations
gonna say about us? My God!

01:21:00.798 --> 01:21:03.425
You know, someday
we're gonna be like him.

01:21:03.593 --> 01:21:08.180
And he was probably one of the beautiful
people, dancing and playing tennis.

01:21:08.347 --> 01:21:10.807
And now look.
This is what happens to us.

01:21:10.975 --> 01:21:14.644
You know, it's important
to have some kind of personal integrity.

01:21:14.812 --> 01:21:17.272
I'll be hanging
in a classroom one day...

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.195
...and I wanna make sure when I thin out
that I'm... well thought of.

01:21:22.362 --> 01:21:23.738
Ike!

01:21:23.906 --> 01:21:26.073
Isaac, where are you going?

01:22:19.504 --> 01:22:22.214
No, I knew Yale had affairs.

01:22:23.132 --> 01:22:25.217
But then, nothing's perfect.

01:22:25.385 --> 01:22:30.097
Marriage is a... requires
some minor compromises, I guess.

01:22:30.265 --> 01:22:33.308
It's funny 'cause I'm just
a non-compromiser.

01:22:33.476 --> 01:22:36.311
I mean, I can't... I can't see that.

01:22:36.479 --> 01:22:39.982
I think it's always
a mistake to look the other way

01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:42.150
'cause you pay for it in the end.

01:22:42.318 --> 01:22:45.487
But then you saw what Jill
wrote about me in that book.

01:22:45.655 --> 01:22:47.656
I'm living in the past.

01:22:47.824 --> 01:22:49.908
How about you? You seeing anybody?

01:22:50.076 --> 01:22:54.872
Yeah. You know, I... I never had any
problem meeting women. I mean, that's...

01:22:55.039 --> 01:22:58.083
But I was thinking about this
just about a week ago.

01:22:58.251 --> 01:23:00.294
I think, and I know this sounds strange,

01:23:00.461 --> 01:23:02.963
but I think
I really missed a good bet...

01:23:03.131 --> 01:23:05.132
...when I let Tracy go.

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.509
- Remember Tracy?
- Yeah. I liked her.

01:23:07.677 --> 01:23:10.637
Yeah. I was thinking about this
at home last week...

01:23:10.805 --> 01:23:14.517
...and I think, of all the women
I've known over the last years...

01:23:14.685 --> 01:23:17.562
...when I actually
am honest with myself,

01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:19.647
I think I had the most relaxed times...

01:23:19.815 --> 01:23:22.317
...and, you know,
the nicest times with her.

01:23:22.484 --> 01:23:24.777
She was a terrific kid,
but young, right?

01:23:24.945 --> 01:23:26.946
So that's that.

01:23:27.114 --> 01:23:29.115
Why don't you call her?

01:23:29.283 --> 01:23:32.160
No, I would never do that.
I think I blew that one.

01:23:32.328 --> 01:23:35.705
I kept her at a distance
and I would never give her a chance.

01:23:35.873 --> 01:23:39.751
And she was so sweet, you know.

01:23:39.919 --> 01:23:43.838
She called me. She left a message
with my service about a month ago...

01:23:44.006 --> 01:23:46.591
...that I should
watch Grand Illusion on television

01:23:46.759 --> 01:23:49.844
and I never returned her call.

01:23:50.012 --> 01:23:53.056
'Cause I, you know, I didn't wanna
lead her on or anything.

01:23:53.223 --> 01:23:55.516
She really cared about me and I...

01:23:56.852 --> 01:23:59.103
You know I was
a little pissed off at you.

01:23:59.271 --> 01:24:00.647
Me?

01:24:00.814 --> 01:24:05.652
I figured if you hadn't introduced Mary
to Yale, this might never have happened.

01:24:09.115 --> 01:24:14.036
An idea for a short story
about, um, people in Manhattan...

01:24:14.204 --> 01:24:16.830
...who are constantly creating...

01:24:16.998 --> 01:24:21.502
...these real, unnecessary,
neurotic problems for themselves...

01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.671
...'cause it keeps them from dealing

01:24:23.838 --> 01:24:27.841
with more unsolvable,
terrifying problems...

01:24:28.009 --> 01:24:30.135
...about, uh, the universe.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.932
Um, let's, uh...
Well, it has to be optimistic.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:38.936
Well, all right, why is life worth
living? That's a very good question.

01:24:39.104 --> 01:24:40.980
Um...

01:24:41.606 --> 01:24:45.985
Well, there are certain things,
I guess, that make it worthwhile.

01:24:46.653 --> 01:24:48.946
Uh, like what?

01:24:49.489 --> 01:24:54.326
OK, um, for me, uh...

01:24:55.203 --> 01:25:00.833
Ooh, I would say Groucho Marx,
to name one thing.

01:25:01.292 --> 01:25:04.670
Um, and Willie Mays.

01:25:04.838 --> 01:25:10.468
And, um... the second movement
of the Jupiter Symphony.

01:25:11.137 --> 01:25:16.975
And, um, Louis Armstrong's
recording of Potato Head Blues.

01:25:17.476 --> 01:25:20.854
Um, Swedish movies, naturally.

01:25:21.022 --> 01:25:23.898
Sentimental Education by Flaubert.

01:25:24.066 --> 01:25:27.193
Uh, Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra.

01:25:27.862 --> 01:25:31.990
Um, those incredible apples

01:25:32.158 --> 01:25:34.117
and pears by CÃ©zanne.

01:25:35.161 --> 01:25:37.871
Uh, the crabs at Sam Wo's.

01:25:39.206 --> 01:25:43.334
Um, Tracy's face.

01:29:25.186 --> 01:29:26.979
Hi.

01:29:27.146 --> 01:29:29.022
Hi.

01:29:29.983 --> 01:29:31.566
I...

01:29:31.734 --> 01:29:33.777
What are you doing here?

01:29:33.945 --> 01:29:36.655
Well, I ran.

01:29:37.365 --> 01:29:40.659
I tried to call you on the phone,
but, uh, it was busy...

01:29:40.827 --> 01:29:44.162
...so I knew that
was two hours' worth of...

01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:46.832
So I couldn't get a taxi cab, so I ran.

01:29:50.462 --> 01:29:52.463
Where you going?

01:29:52.631 --> 01:29:54.507
London.

01:29:55.175 --> 01:29:57.176
You're going to London now?

01:29:57.344 --> 01:30:01.806
What d'you... What d'you mean? If I got
over here two minutes later, you'd be...

01:30:01.974 --> 01:30:04.058
...you'd be going to London?

01:30:09.315 --> 01:30:12.275
Well, let me get
right to the point then.

01:30:12.443 --> 01:30:14.235
I don't think you oughta go.

01:30:14.403 --> 01:30:18.239
I think I made a big mistake.
And I would prefer it if you didn't go.

01:30:18.407 --> 01:30:20.408
Oh, Isaac.

01:30:20.576 --> 01:30:24.954
I mean it. I know it looks real bad now,
but, uh, you know, it, uh...

01:30:25.122 --> 01:30:27.999
Are you seeing anybody?
Are you going with anybody?

01:30:28.167 --> 01:30:29.625
No.

01:30:30.711 --> 01:30:32.712
So... well...

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.841
D'you still love me,
or has that worn off or what?

01:30:38.552 --> 01:30:40.636
Jesus, you... pop up...

01:30:41.555 --> 01:30:44.641
You don't call me
and then you suddenly appear.

01:30:45.226 --> 01:30:48.854
I mean... What happened
to that woman you met?

01:30:49.022 --> 01:30:52.691
Well, I'll tell you,
I don't see her any more.

01:30:52.859 --> 01:30:56.612
I made a mistake.
What d'you want me to say?

01:30:57.614 --> 01:31:00.115
I don't think you oughta go to London.

01:31:02.786 --> 01:31:04.953
Well, I have to go.

01:31:05.121 --> 01:31:07.915
I mean, all the plans
have been made, arrangements.

01:31:08.083 --> 01:31:12.503
I mean, my parents are there now
looking for a place for me to live.

01:31:14.506 --> 01:31:16.507
Well...

01:31:16.674 --> 01:31:19.593
Do you still love me or what?

01:31:21.054 --> 01:31:23.138
Do you love me?

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.058
Well, yeah, that's what... Of course.

01:31:26.226 --> 01:31:28.852
That's what this is all about, you know.

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.772
- Guess what? I turned 18 the other day.
- Did you?

01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:34.108
I'm legal, but I'm still a kid.

01:31:34.275 --> 01:31:37.277
You're not such a kid. 18 years old.

01:31:37.445 --> 01:31:40.782
They could draft you.
In some countries you'd be...

01:31:43.452 --> 01:31:46.704
- You look good.
- You really hurt me.

01:31:46.872 --> 01:31:48.915
It was not on purpose, you know.

01:31:49.083 --> 01:31:52.419
I mean, I, uh...
You know, it was... I mean...

01:31:53.254 --> 01:31:56.172
It was just the way
I was looking at things then.

01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:58.842
Well, I'll be back in six months.

01:31:59.009 --> 01:32:01.511
Six months! Are you kidding?

01:32:02.179 --> 01:32:04.472
Six months you're gonna go for?

01:32:05.641 --> 01:32:11.020
We've gone this long. I mean, what's
six months if we still love each other?

01:32:11.188 --> 01:32:13.189
Hey, don't be so mature, OK?

01:32:13.357 --> 01:32:15.984
I mean, six months is a long time.
Six months!

01:32:16.152 --> 01:32:19.404
You're gonna be in the thea...

01:32:19.572 --> 01:32:21.823
...working in the theatre
with actors and directors.

01:32:21.991 --> 01:32:25.785
You know, you go to rehearsal
and you hang out with those people.

01:32:25.953 --> 01:32:31.499
You have lunch a lot and before you know
it attachments form and... you know...

01:32:31.667 --> 01:32:35.336
I mean, you don't wanna get into that...
You'll change.

01:32:35.504 --> 01:32:38.549
In six months you'll be
a completely different person.

01:32:38.717 --> 01:32:41.927
Well, don't you want me
to have that experience?

01:32:42.095 --> 01:32:45.347
I mean, a while ago
you made such a convincing case.

01:32:47.392 --> 01:32:50.644
Yeah, of course I do, but, you know...

01:32:50.812 --> 01:32:55.191
I mean, I just don't want that thing
about you that I like to change.

01:32:59.571 --> 01:33:01.697
I've gotta make a plane.

01:33:01.865 --> 01:33:04.783
Come on, you don't... Come on.

01:33:04.951 --> 01:33:07.369
You don't... You don't have to go.

01:33:08.371 --> 01:33:11.707
Why couldn't you have
brought this up last week?

01:33:14.377 --> 01:33:16.795
Six months isn't so long.

01:33:18.548 --> 01:33:21.050
Not everybody gets corrupted.

01:33:23.271 --> 01:33:26.639
You have to have
a little faith in people.
