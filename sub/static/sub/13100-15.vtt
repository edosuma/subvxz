August 3, 2260.
Personal diary.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.625
Ten days ago,
for the first time

00:10.708 --> 00:12.750
the Shadows began
attacking openly.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.250
So far, they've been hitting
targets close to the Rim.

00:17.333 --> 00:21.958
The minor powers, a few in the
League of Non-Aligned Worlds.

00:22.042 --> 00:25.625
The attacks seemed totally
random, almost senseless.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.625
If we thought it was nuts
around here before

00:31.708 --> 00:33.750
this has only
made things worse.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.292
We've had to hire more security
personnel to keep things calm.

00:45.375 --> 00:47.833
Make sure the wrong type
of people don't get on board.

00:52.167 --> 00:55.375
But without our resources back
home for background checks

00:55.458 --> 00:57.875
we have to assume
there will be lapses.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.917
[music continues]

01:17.083 --> 01:20.250
(Ivanova)
Everyone's been handling
the stress pretty well.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.667
But sooner or later

01:23.750 --> 01:26.000
something's got
to give somewhere.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.167
[clatters]

01:30.625 --> 01:33.750
(Ivanova)
Nobody's seen Kosh
in almost a week.

01:33.833 --> 01:37.792
When the Vorlon goes
to ground, I worry.

01:37.875 --> 01:41.125
What's going through his,
its mind?

01:41.208 --> 01:43.042
I can't even guess.

01:45.458 --> 01:48.167
And Londo, Londo is Londo.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.333
You never know which way
he'll jump next.

01:50.417 --> 01:51.500
[doorbell chimes]

01:51.583 --> 01:52.958
Come.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.417
- Londo, you wanted to see me?
- Yes, Vir.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.833
Alright, that's fine.

01:58.917 --> 02:01.833
Bring in the waist a little
and we'll be done.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.750
Good, good.

02:03.833 --> 02:08.792
Now, Vir, I want you
to rent a suite for me.

02:08.875 --> 02:11.750
The biggest suite
in all of Babylon 5

02:11.833 --> 02:14.833
and I want it filled
with flowers.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.917
[sighs]
It'll cost.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.042
Pay it.
Nothing is too good for her.

02:20.125 --> 02:24.083
- Her? Her who?
- Adira.

02:24.167 --> 02:28.292
After all this time, she is
finally coming back to me.

02:33.042 --> 02:35.958
(Ivanova)
So far, we've got everything
more or less under control.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.917
We should be okay for now.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.583
As long as nothing else
goes wrong.

02:45.083 --> 02:48.167
[dramatic music]

02:58.167 --> 03:02.708
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was
our last, best hope for peace.

03:06.292 --> 03:07.792
It failed.

03:07.875 --> 03:10.917
[dramatic music]

03:23.000 --> 03:24.667
(Ivanova)
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:24.750 --> 03:27.042
it became something greater.

03:27.125 --> 03:30.500
Our last best hope for victory.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.542
The year is 2260.

03:37.625 --> 03:40.167
The place, Babylon 5.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.292
[theme music]

04:13.250 --> 04:16.333
[music continues]

04:27.125 --> 04:29.792
(male #1)
'Their technology is too far
advanced beyond our own.'

04:31.417 --> 04:32.583
We cannot defend ourselves

04:32.667 --> 04:35.250
against this new enemy
without help.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.792
'Is there anything
that Earth can do?'

04:37.875 --> 04:41.292
Well, my people back home have
their own problems right now.

04:41.375 --> 04:42.667
Since we declared independence

04:42.750 --> 04:44.750
we are not exactly
in the position

04:44.833 --> 04:46.458
to ask them for anything.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.167
Everyone's on their own.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.750
I sometimes think
that was the intent.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.542
Our military is
hopelessly outnumbered.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.750
We lost many ships in our recent
war with our neighbors.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.875
Now you're all
in the same position

04:59.958 --> 05:01.917
unable to defend yourselves.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.875
'I can't believe you would've
trusted the Shadows'

05:04.958 --> 05:07.083
when they said
they were on your side.

05:07.167 --> 05:09.042
They just wanted you
to waste your resources

05:09.125 --> 05:10.458
fighting each other.

05:10.542 --> 05:13.000
We thought they recognized
our value over theirs.

05:13.083 --> 05:16.000
It's not about value.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.458
It's, it's, I-I don't
know what it is.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.708
I don't know what
the Shadows want exactly

05:21.792 --> 05:25.042
but they are not on anybody's
side, but their own.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.375
I've asked a representative
from the Gaim to join us here

05:28.458 --> 05:30.625
because they are the closest
major civilization

05:30.708 --> 05:33.458
in your sector of space.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.917
Ambassador She'lah,
there are four other worlds

05:36.000 --> 05:38.917
in your area that could help
the Brakiri.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.417
But they said
they would only consider it

05:41.500 --> 05:43.458
if your people got involved.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.500
- Will you?
- No.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.208
And why not?

05:52.292 --> 05:56.625
We are not attacked yet,
may not be attacked.

05:56.708 --> 06:00.083
If we join Brakiri,
we are noticed.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.458
We invite attack.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.958
They are going to come
for you sooner or later.

06:07.042 --> 06:09.250
You do not know that.

06:09.333 --> 06:13.250
What they do not see,
they may not attack.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.917
The enemy is powerful.

06:16.042 --> 06:20.625
Show us you have equal power,
then we will consider.

06:20.708 --> 06:24.042
If not, we will stay quiet.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.625
Do you have equal power?

06:30.042 --> 06:31.792
No, no, no, I am sorry

06:31.875 --> 06:34.542
but I completely disagree
with your prognosis.

06:34.625 --> 06:35.750
Well then, you shouldn't
have brought him to me

06:35.833 --> 06:37.250
for a second opinion.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.708
Prepare to ventilate
lung number three.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.500
You do that, you disrupt
his entire metabolism.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.333
Look, this is my facility,
Dr. Hobb

06:42.417 --> 06:43.917
and I don't like having
my judgment questioned.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.458
I'm not questioning
your judgment.

06:45.542 --> 06:46.625
I'm saying you're flat wrong.

06:46.708 --> 06:47.625
Look, I don't have time for this

06:47.708 --> 06:49.917
and neither does he, alright?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.458
'Begin ventilation
to take the pressure off'

06:51.542 --> 06:52.917
'the secondary
pulmonary system.'

06:53.000 --> 06:54.750
- Where should we stop?
- Nine PSI.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.292
- Doctor.
- Look, have a seat.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.792
Lend a hand
or get out of my way

06:57.875 --> 07:00.042
question me
in my lab, doctor.

07:00.125 --> 07:04.833
- Doc, we've got an emergency.
- Get in line.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.042
He was breaking up
a fight in Downbelow.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.500
Somebody attacked him.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.417
I've got minimal life signs,
severe cardiac arrhythmia.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.750
Blood pressure dropping fast.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.000
Alright, get him to the
infirmary, start an IV

07:13.083 --> 07:14.500
and cardiac stabilization.

07:14.583 --> 07:15.958
(Ed)
Dr. Franklin,
we're losing him.

07:16.042 --> 07:17.500
What? What are
you talkin' about?

07:17.583 --> 07:19.333
- I said we're losing him.
- He's right.

07:19.417 --> 07:20.917
We lost bio-signs
when lung number three

07:21.000 --> 07:22.375
dropped below 11 PSI.

07:22.458 --> 07:25.000
Well, bring him up.
I told you to stop at 13 PSI.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.333
- Doctor.
- Get him up fast.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.917
I want 13 PSI right now.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.167
Bring him up that fast and you
might rupture the lung cap.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.875
That's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

07:31.958 --> 07:33.833
- Doc? I just want to--
- Just a second.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.750
What the hell is with
everybody in this room?

07:35.833 --> 07:38.167
Doesn't anyone listen
to one damn word I say?

07:38.250 --> 07:39.667
I said we will take the chance

07:39.750 --> 07:41.250
and I said we will
take care of him.

07:41.333 --> 07:44.292
Ed, I said 13 PSI.

07:44.375 --> 07:49.000
Thirteen! 13! 13!
Now, you got it? Damn it!

07:49.083 --> 07:51.250
(Ed)
Respiratory system stabilizing.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.000
Lung cap in place.

07:55.292 --> 07:57.708
Good.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.708
Good. Uh, Michael, look, I know
he's one of yours, alright.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.917
We're gonna take care
of him, okay?

08:05.708 --> 08:07.375
It's gross incompetence.
I told him to stop--

08:07.458 --> 08:09.708
- At nine PSI.
- Damn it, doctor.

08:09.792 --> 08:13.167
Shall we check
the lab tapes to confirm?

08:13.250 --> 08:15.667
You check whatever you want.
I don't give a damn.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.792
(Londo)
So it's my title
you wanted all along, huh?

08:28.875 --> 08:31.875
I want no more than I'm getting.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.292
And what is it that
you're getting, Adira?

08:37.667 --> 08:43.417
A washed-up old Republican
dreaming of better days?

08:43.500 --> 08:46.458
These are my better days, Londo.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.917
Thanks to you.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.917
We, Centauri, live our lives
for appearances.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.500
But when I look beneath the mask
I am forced to wear..

08:58.375 --> 09:00.458
...I see only emptiness.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.792
And then I think of you..

09:05.292 --> 09:06.708
...and I say..

09:08.250 --> 09:10.458
"...To hell with appearances."

09:12.250 --> 09:15.500
(Adira)
Do you know what freedom
means to a slave?

09:15.583 --> 09:17.208
Then take this..

09:18.875 --> 09:22.458
...and wear it proudly
as a free woman.

09:24.167 --> 09:28.667
And someday, come back to me.

09:37.625 --> 09:41.458
Bye, my ambassador.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.750
(Vir)
Ambassador.

09:48.833 --> 09:52.167
- Londo?
- Yes, Vir. What is it?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.917
You asked me to remind you
about Adira's suite.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.208
You can look at it
whenever you like.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.333
Alright, I'll be right there.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.417
[electricity shuts down]

10:14.708 --> 10:17.750
[dramatic music]

10:19.625 --> 10:21.750
Hello? Who is there?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.375
Hello, Mollari.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.917
We have something to settle,
you and I.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.667
[dramatic music]

10:36.750 --> 10:39.458
I'm disappointed
in you, Mollari.

10:39.542 --> 10:41.500
I don't know how you did it.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.833
Lord Refa isn't returning
my calls anymore.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.708
Somehow you convinced
your government

10:46.792 --> 10:48.875
to pull back their campaign

10:48.958 --> 10:52.042
against several other worlds
on the fringe of Centauri space.

10:54.792 --> 10:58.375
I may have said a word
to someone here and there.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.042
Something about not
weakening our defensives

11:01.125 --> 11:03.542
by fighting
trivial border wars.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.167
I thought we had a deal.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.167
We carved up the galaxy,
you and I.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.708
Yes, we did.

11:10.792 --> 11:13.458
And what you do in your half
is your business

11:13.542 --> 11:15.875
and what I do in mine is mine.

11:15.958 --> 11:19.750
We need your government
to continue its campaign.

11:19.833 --> 11:24.125
Yes, and why is that, hmm?

11:24.208 --> 11:25.917
I don't think
you have any interest

11:26.000 --> 11:29.708
in restoring the glory
of the Centauri Republic.

11:29.792 --> 11:33.833
'No, I think
you are using us as..'

11:35.542 --> 11:40.750
...shall we say,
agents of chaos.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.875
A convenient distraction
making it easier

11:42.958 --> 11:47.583
for your associates to do
whatever they wish to do, yes?

11:47.667 --> 11:50.250
[zapping in distance]

11:50.333 --> 11:53.083
My associates need
a voice and an ear

11:53.167 --> 11:55.250
in the Centauri royal court.

11:55.333 --> 11:58.292
If you violate the terms
of our agreement

11:58.375 --> 12:01.833
my associates may turn their eye
toward your home world.

12:01.917 --> 12:04.042
Then we shall pluck it out.

12:05.542 --> 12:09.750
If you put yourself
between us and our objectives

12:09.833 --> 12:11.792
you may come to regret it.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.833
There is nothing
you can do to me, Mr. Morden..

12:16.208 --> 12:18.042
...that has not
already been done.

12:18.125 --> 12:21.208
[zapping continues]

12:24.000 --> 12:25.417
Good day.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.250
[Shadow squeaks]

12:33.333 --> 12:34.375
No.

12:35.417 --> 12:37.500
We need him alive for now.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.000
There are other ways.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.375
[doorbell chimes]

12:45.458 --> 12:46.792
Yeah, come in.

12:49.750 --> 12:50.833
(Garibaldi)
'Stephen.'

12:50.917 --> 12:52.833
Michael, what can I do for you?

12:52.917 --> 12:55.667
I just thought I'd swing by, you
know, see how things are going.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.375
You, uh, coming in
or going out?

12:59.708 --> 13:01.875
I'm going out.

13:01.958 --> 13:03.667
Just took time off long enough
to grab a fast shower

13:03.750 --> 13:05.750
something to eat,
I gotta get back to work.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.292
I thought your shift ended
half an hour ago.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.042
Well, it did.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.833
But we're, uh, shorthanded
and since I can handle it--

13:11.917 --> 13:15.000
- I don't think so.
- Excuse me?

13:15.083 --> 13:16.875
I don't think you can handle it.

13:16.958 --> 13:18.875
I don't think
you are handling it.

13:18.958 --> 13:22.375
Look, I saw how you were
this afternoon in Medlab.

13:22.458 --> 13:23.875
Well, it was busy.
I lost my temper.

13:23.958 --> 13:25.958
No, you were five seconds
away from hysteria.

13:26.042 --> 13:28.083
You were crazed and distracted
and it nearly cost you

13:28.167 --> 13:29.958
the life of one your patients.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.125
- Look, it came out alright.
- Yeah, this time.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.750
What about next time?

13:33.833 --> 13:35.708
Look, I don't have to
defend myself to you.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.375
I think you do.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.375
Somethin' here
ain't right, Stephen.

13:39.458 --> 13:42.667
As your friend, I'm concerned.
As the head of security--

13:42.750 --> 13:44.542
Yeah, what are you
gonna do, Michael?

13:44.625 --> 13:46.333
Arrest me for being distracted?

13:46.417 --> 13:48.333
I didn't know that a crime.

13:48.417 --> 13:51.250
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get dressed

13:51.333 --> 13:52.292
and get back to work.

13:52.375 --> 13:53.625
Hey, Stephen, wake up.

13:53.708 --> 13:54.792
For the last six months,
you've been acting

13:54.875 --> 13:56.500
more and more erratic.

13:56.583 --> 13:59.333
Now it's not just me.
Everybody's noticed.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.250
Look, if it's the stims,
again, I can help.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.500
Would you just give it a rest?

14:03.583 --> 14:06.292
You've been riding my butt
about stims all year.

14:06.375 --> 14:08.250
Enough.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.917
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.083
Don't make me go around you
to do my job.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.583
You do whatever
you have to, Michael.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.333
I don't care.

14:17.417 --> 14:19.000
I am tired of this discussion

14:19.083 --> 14:21.833
and I'm tired of you buttin'
into my life every 15 minutes.

14:21.917 --> 14:24.333
So you do your job
and I'll do mine, okay?

14:24.417 --> 14:26.583
Okay, fine. Just remember,
I came to you first.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.250
I gave you a chance.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.667
Hell of a lot more
than you're giving me.

14:45.167 --> 14:48.125
It's late. You should rest.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.750
Oh, I can't. I can't.

14:50.833 --> 14:53.083
The reports keep coming in.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.417
More hit-and-run Shadow attacks.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.417
They jump in,
blow everything up in sight

14:58.500 --> 15:00.167
and then jump out again.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.333
They don't even bother
to secure the area.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.375
It doesn't make sense.

15:04.458 --> 15:07.375
It's the same pattern
they used a thousand years ago.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.583
It keeps the major powers
off guard

15:10.667 --> 15:12.458
never knowing
when to expect an attack.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.958
But what is the goal?

15:15.042 --> 15:17.750
If it isn't about territory,
what is it about?

15:23.458 --> 15:26.250
I don't know, Delenn.
I don't know.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.500
The only way we're going
to survive this war

15:28.583 --> 15:30.500
is to organize the League,
the Narns

15:30.583 --> 15:32.208
and as many other races
as possible

15:32.292 --> 15:34.875
into a cohesive,
offensive force.

15:39.500 --> 15:43.958
It's never been done before
and I can see why.

15:44.042 --> 15:47.000
I mean, it's like stacking
marbles in a corner.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.000
They are hip-deep
in their own agendas

15:49.083 --> 15:51.500
and their own rivalries.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.000
I mean, half of them won't
talk to the other half.

15:55.083 --> 15:58.292
- 'But what's worse?'
- What?

16:01.333 --> 16:03.458
I feel like I'm lying to them.

16:05.333 --> 16:08.042
Um, you've seen the reports
from the front lines.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.458
Yes, I have ideas.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.458
Some possibilities.

16:15.292 --> 16:17.458
But at this moment,
the stone-cold fact is that

16:17.542 --> 16:20.167
none of us can stand up
to those ships.

16:22.042 --> 16:25.708
If we could just score one
victory against the Shadows

16:25.792 --> 16:29.042
it'd be enough to make
some of the others come around.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.167
Then perhaps we should
give them a victory.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.708
- Oh, just like that?
- Just like that.

16:35.792 --> 16:38.042
And how do you suggest
we do that?

16:40.083 --> 16:42.292
I'm sure you'll think
of something.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.750
Every day people around here
start talking

16:55.833 --> 16:58.083
more and more like Kosh.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.417
[indistinct chatter]

17:10.000 --> 17:13.167
- Doctor, may I?
- Please.

17:15.083 --> 17:17.042
Never ceases to amaze me.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.958
Every time someone says we're
becoming a paperless society

17:20.042 --> 17:23.625
I get ten more forms
to fill out.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.792
So what can I do for you,
Mr. Garibaldi?

17:26.875 --> 17:28.417
I saw what happened in Medlab.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.083
I checked the tapes.
You're right.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.958
Dr. Franklin, gave the med techs
the wrong information.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.625
Yes?

17:34.708 --> 17:37.042
And if they hadn't caught it
as quick as they did

17:37.125 --> 17:38.833
the patient would've died.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.417
Very likely.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.417
As I understand it, everyone
working in a Medlab facility

17:44.500 --> 17:46.500
with constant exposure
to alien life forms

17:46.583 --> 17:48.167
has to submit blood samples
on a regular basis

17:48.250 --> 17:49.750
for examination, right?

17:49.833 --> 17:52.125
Mm-hmm, that's right.
It's all done automatically.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.583
- Who gets these tests?
- Dr. Franklin.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.625
As chief of staff,
he's the only one authorized

17:56.708 --> 17:59.500
for that kind of access.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.708
But you know where they are.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.292
I do.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.958
I need you to pull
Franklin's blood samples

18:06.042 --> 18:08.667
for the last 12 months,
check for anything

18:08.750 --> 18:10.500
out of the ordinary.

18:10.583 --> 18:13.000
Does the word privacy mean
anything to you, Mr. Garibaldi?

18:13.083 --> 18:14.667
Look, as head of security,
I can get that information

18:14.750 --> 18:15.958
myself through channels,
but that means

18:16.042 --> 18:17.417
bringing other people in on it.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.167
And if those samples show
what I think they show

18:19.250 --> 18:21.750
Stephen can pretty much kiss
the rest of his career goodbye.

18:21.833 --> 18:23.917
I'm trying to help him.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.250
No, I'm sorry,
if you want that information

18:32.333 --> 18:33.500
'you're going to have to go
through channels.'

18:33.583 --> 18:35.542
I can't just give it to you.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.792
Alright, can you at least tell
me where it is in the system?

18:37.875 --> 18:40.958
Just to make it easy to find
when I do go through channels.

18:49.417 --> 18:51.917
Mr. Garibaldi,
Stephen and I have had

18:52.000 --> 18:56.708
our professional disagreements
from time to time, but..

18:58.625 --> 19:00.292
...I don't wanna see him hurt.

19:00.375 --> 19:01.833
Neither do I.

19:02.958 --> 19:04.917
I just hope it's not too late.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.417
And we'll need
a dozen bottles of Brivari

19:19.500 --> 19:21.542
at least ten years old.

19:21.625 --> 19:26.333
Uh, several carafes of hot jala
and three dozen..

19:26.417 --> 19:29.042
No, make it four dozen
bouquets of star laces.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.583
This is gonna be expensive.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.250
You can put it on the
ambassador's personal account.

19:33.333 --> 19:34.583
- Anything else?
- 'Uh, yes.'

19:34.667 --> 19:37.167
Um, personal effects
for Lady Adira.

19:37.250 --> 19:41.417
Uh, clothes and...things.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.083
What kind of things?

19:43.167 --> 19:44.542
Um..

19:47.333 --> 19:48.917
Whoa.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.375
She'll need something nice
to wear when she arrives.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.958
You want this one here
with or without garters?

19:56.042 --> 19:59.125
- You know, I, uh, I'm not--
- Okay, with.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.292
You can never go wrong
with garters.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.458
Oh, you might.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.208
Look, I'll gonna leave
the list here

20:05.292 --> 20:07.708
and I'll come back
and check on it later, okay?

20:22.875 --> 20:24.750
Hello, Vir.

20:24.833 --> 20:27.292
I'm-I'm sorry. I can't talk.

20:27.375 --> 20:30.708
- I have things to do.
- Well, apparently so.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.208
Anything I can do to help?

20:32.292 --> 20:35.875
Um, short of dying, no.

20:35.958 --> 20:37.875
I can't think of a thing.

20:47.167 --> 20:48.333
I-I-I'm sorry to bother you.

20:48.417 --> 20:50.625
I-I'm looking for Vir Cotto.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.125
Um, I was supposed
to meet him here.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.000
You just missed him.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.792
I had some details
to work out with him.

20:56.875 --> 20:58.500
Details, huh?

20:58.583 --> 21:00.375
I-I think that he said he was
gonna talk to you about them.

21:00.458 --> 21:03.583
Perhaps you could just
tell me what I missed.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.542
Computer, security override.
Code 995 Alpha.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.167
Voice identification,
Michael Garibaldi.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.250
[automated message]
'Confirmed.'

21:23.333 --> 21:26.167
Display the following
blood sample tests.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.167
Franklin, Stephen.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.417
'File numbers.'

21:31.083 --> 21:34.042
[automated message]
'Awaiting file numbers
for display.'

21:38.292 --> 21:39.333
No.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.542
No, never mind. Abort.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.458
Why?

21:46.625 --> 21:49.542
Why'd I do it
or why didn't I do it?

21:49.625 --> 21:51.375
Why didn't you do it?

21:51.458 --> 21:53.833
Because on some level,
you've got to know the truth.

21:53.917 --> 21:57.208
And after everything we've been
through if you can't talk to me

21:57.292 --> 21:59.333
what's the hell's the point?

21:59.417 --> 22:02.042
You know, when I figured
out what you were doin'

22:02.125 --> 22:04.000
I ran the test myself

22:04.083 --> 22:06.083
checking for stim levels.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.958
I figured I'd show you

22:08.042 --> 22:10.208
and prove to you
that you were wrong.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.458
The thing about medicine is that

22:15.542 --> 22:17.875
it all comes down
to the numbers.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.958
X amount of something is safe.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.583
Y amount is dangerous.

22:26.667 --> 22:29.292
X amount of stims
in your bloodstream

22:29.375 --> 22:31.500
proves that you're not addicted.

22:33.042 --> 22:35.000
Y amount proves that you are.

22:37.167 --> 22:38.208
[chuckles]

22:40.000 --> 22:41.667
It's funny..

22:43.625 --> 22:46.292
..how easy it is
to just lose track.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.750
You don't realize
how much you're doin'.

22:52.958 --> 22:55.125
But the numbers don't lie,
do they?

22:57.750 --> 22:59.125
No, they don't.

23:07.792 --> 23:08.958
So..

23:11.167 --> 23:13.125
...now that we both
know the truth..

23:14.958 --> 23:16.333
...what are you gonna do
about it?

23:16.417 --> 23:17.625
That's funny.

23:17.708 --> 23:20.417
I was just gonna ask
you the same question

23:20.500 --> 23:23.167
'cause right now,
it's not my decision.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.375
- It's yours.
- Yeah.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.417
I guess it is.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.292
Nobody wants to fight a war
unless they know

23:39.375 --> 23:42.000
there's at least a chance
of winning.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.083
You can give them that hope.

23:44.167 --> 23:45.708
As one of the older races

23:45.792 --> 23:49.000
your technology has to be
at least as good as the Shadows.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.417
Now if you can convince
your government

23:50.500 --> 23:52.000
to send out an expedition

23:52.083 --> 23:55.083
to engage one or two
of their ships.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.500
No.

23:57.583 --> 23:58.792
Alright, I know you can't take

23:58.875 --> 24:01.167
the entire Shadow fleet
by yourselves

24:01.250 --> 24:03.625
but if you could beat them
in just one fight

24:03.708 --> 24:06.333
that could be the break we need
to get everyone organized.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.333
Then we'd have a real chance.

24:10.458 --> 24:12.583
You could do it, couldn't you?

24:13.750 --> 24:18.667
Perhaps, but there are
still few of us.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.875
It is not our time.

24:21.708 --> 24:23.208
It is yours.

24:24.292 --> 24:26.750
We are not prepared yet.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.708
Don't turn your back on me.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.500
Don't you even try
to walk away from me.

24:32.583 --> 24:35.708
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

24:35.792 --> 24:37.542
Oh, wait, I know what
you think you are

24:37.625 --> 24:40.708
what you want us to believe,
but I don't buy it.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.708
For three years now, you've
been pulling everyone's strings

24:42.792 --> 24:44.042
getting us to do all the work

24:44.125 --> 24:45.333
and you haven't done
a damn thing

24:45.417 --> 24:47.917
but stand there
and look cryptic.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.250
Well, it's about time
you started

24:49.333 --> 24:51.292
pulling your own
weight around here.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.583
(male #2)
We're getting
an energy surge.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.500
- Location?
- I don't know.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.042
It's a non-localized phenomenon.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.208
I hear you've got a saying.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.917
Understanding
is a three-edged sword.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.875
Well, we've got a saying too.

25:05.958 --> 25:09.000
Put your money
where your mouth is.

25:09.083 --> 25:11.708
- Impudent.
- Yeah?

25:11.792 --> 25:14.417
Well, maybe that's the only way
to get through to you.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.125
You said you wanted to teach me
to fight legends.

25:16.208 --> 25:17.417
Well, you're a legend too

25:17.500 --> 25:19.792
and I am not going away
until you agree.

25:19.875 --> 25:21.250
Incorrect.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.667
[groans]

25:23.917 --> 25:27.958
- Leave now.
- No.

25:28.958 --> 25:31.000
- Disobedient.
- Up yours.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.500
[groans]

25:40.708 --> 25:44.958
So, the real Kosh shows
his colors at last, huh?

25:49.167 --> 25:50.625
You angry now?

25:51.958 --> 25:53.958
Angry enough to kill me?

25:54.042 --> 25:56.250
Because that's the only way
I'm leaving.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.667
'Unless your people get off
their encounter-suited butts'

25:58.750 --> 26:01.333
'and do something,
I've got nothing to lose.'

26:02.917 --> 26:05.000
Hell, my own government
wants to kill me

26:05.083 --> 26:07.458
and if we lose this war,
I'm just as dead.

26:08.625 --> 26:09.958
Our only chance

26:10.042 --> 26:12.250
is to get the other races
on board for this fight.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.917
And right now,
you're the key to doing that.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.625
- It is not yet time.
- And who decides that time?

26:18.708 --> 26:22.042
You? You put me
in this position.

26:22.125 --> 26:24.292
You asked me to fight
this damn war.

26:24.375 --> 26:27.083
Well, it's about time
you let me fight it my way.

26:29.583 --> 26:31.375
How many people
have already died

26:31.458 --> 26:33.417
fighting this war
of yours, huh?

26:33.500 --> 26:35.125
How many more will die
before you come down

26:35.208 --> 26:37.292
off that mountain
and get involved?

26:38.250 --> 26:40.542
Ships, colonies, whole worlds

26:40.625 --> 26:43.583
are being destroyed out there
and you do nothing.

26:44.833 --> 26:46.375
How many more?

26:47.250 --> 26:48.583
How many more, Kosh?

26:48.667 --> 26:51.375
How many more dead
before you're satisfied, huh?

26:51.458 --> 26:53.583
[groans]

27:00.917 --> 27:02.500
Go ahead.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.208
Maybe one more death..

27:06.542 --> 27:08.708
...will help balance
out the books.

27:09.625 --> 27:11.750
'Go on. Get it over with.'

27:14.083 --> 27:16.000
Save us both the trouble later.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.458
[gasps]

27:22.375 --> 27:24.875
I will do as you ask.

27:32.333 --> 27:35.125
But there is a price to pay.

27:35.208 --> 27:38.042
I will not be there
to help you

27:38.125 --> 27:39.917
when you go to Z'ha'dum.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah, you already said
if I go to Z'ha'dum, I'll die.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.958
Yes.

27:46.042 --> 27:47.167
Now.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.250
Alright.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.458
If that's the trade-off

27:52.542 --> 27:55.000
if you wanna withhold
your help when the time comes

27:55.083 --> 27:56.500
that's fine.

27:58.333 --> 28:00.708
I'll go to it alone.

28:00.792 --> 28:06.167
You do not understand,
but you will.

28:22.208 --> 28:23.625
Captain.

28:23.708 --> 28:26.250
Just got word of another
Shadow attack in Brakiri space.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.917
It started about an hour ago.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.083
- Anything else?
- No.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.458
- They're completely outgunned.
- Alright.

28:32.542 --> 28:35.208
Keep monitoring. Let me know
the moment anything changes.

28:41.208 --> 28:44.250
[dramatic music]

29:02.875 --> 29:04.583
[zapping]

29:08.750 --> 29:10.125
[screeches]

29:12.125 --> 29:13.958
[music continues]

29:16.083 --> 29:17.708
[zapping]

29:39.750 --> 29:43.208
Captain, Vorlon fleet
is engaging Shadow vessel.

29:43.292 --> 29:45.167
- The Vorlon?
- Who's winning?

29:45.250 --> 29:46.667
We are.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.500
[zapping]

29:55.792 --> 29:57.833
[cheering]

30:05.125 --> 30:08.250
It's strange.
I can barely catch my breath.

30:08.333 --> 30:10.042
I have been looking
forward to this

30:10.125 --> 30:12.583
for so long that I feel..

30:15.500 --> 30:19.417
Gods, Vir, I feel happy.

30:20.792 --> 30:23.542
I had almost forgotten
what it was like.

30:25.083 --> 30:26.250
'But I don't understand.'

30:26.333 --> 30:27.667
We couldn't have missed her.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.083
Excuse me, sir.

30:29.167 --> 30:32.000
There are more coming
behind you, are there not?

30:44.417 --> 30:47.542
Excuse me, uh,
anyone else on board?

31:05.958 --> 31:07.917
Ambassador?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.417
Who is that?

31:09.500 --> 31:12.458
- I'm sorry. This isn't--
- I said who is that?

31:12.542 --> 31:14.250
Her name is Adira Tyree.

31:14.333 --> 31:15.875
[sobs]

31:15.958 --> 31:19.250
The purser found her in her
cabin just before they docked.

31:21.333 --> 31:23.292
'I'm sorry, ambassador.'

31:23.375 --> 31:25.917
- 'Did you know her?'
- How?

31:28.375 --> 31:32.292
- How did she die?
- We don't know.

31:32.375 --> 31:33.958
There was no sign of violence.

31:34.042 --> 31:36.125
No obvious trauma.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.292
It may have been natural causes.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.750
We won't know for sure,
until there's an autopsy.

31:41.792 --> 31:45.250
Why? Why did you do this?

31:45.333 --> 31:49.333
Poison was always the instrument
of choice in the old republic.

31:49.417 --> 31:53.042
Being something
of a sentimentalist

31:53.125 --> 31:55.167
I got here first

31:55.250 --> 31:57.792
'and because, sooner or later'

31:57.875 --> 31:59.833
'you would do it to me.'

32:02.042 --> 32:03.333
(Hobbs)
I'm sorry, ambassador.

32:03.417 --> 32:05.583
I'll see it to it
you get a full report.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.333
- Check her for poison.
- Yes.

32:07.417 --> 32:09.917
You hear me?
Check her for poison.

32:10.917 --> 32:12.000
Londo.

32:12.083 --> 32:13.667
[sobs]

32:20.083 --> 32:23.125
[intense music]

32:43.167 --> 32:45.042
[whispers]

32:49.792 --> 32:52.458
(Ivanova)
The news is spreading
all over the place, captain.

32:54.292 --> 32:57.458
We've got every ambassador in
the station ready to sign on.

33:01.542 --> 33:06.792
(Sheridan)
I should stop by and see Kosh,
thank him for his help.

33:06.875 --> 33:09.458
(Ivanova)
It's almost 2:00 a.m.,
you're exhausted.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.833
My grandfather had a saying.

33:11.917 --> 33:13.333
Good news can wait.

33:13.417 --> 33:15.958
Bad news will refuse to leave.

33:16.042 --> 33:17.375
Get some sleep.

33:27.292 --> 33:28.500
[beeps]

33:40.208 --> 33:41.958
[squeaks]

33:44.958 --> 33:46.167
(male #3)
John?

33:47.625 --> 33:49.042
Johnny.

33:53.708 --> 33:54.750
Dad?

33:56.917 --> 33:58.833
I don't have much time, son.

34:01.750 --> 34:05.292
I want you to know
you were right.

34:05.375 --> 34:07.625
I didn't want to admit that.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.875
Just pride, I guess.

34:11.167 --> 34:14.792
You get, at my age,
you get kinda set in your ways.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.083
It had to be done.

34:19.167 --> 34:22.750
Don't blame yourself
for what happened later.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.500
[grunts]

34:31.583 --> 34:33.083
Dad, are you..

34:34.042 --> 34:35.333
Are you alright?

34:35.417 --> 34:37.333
It's too late for me.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.625
I'm sorry for what I did before.

34:41.708 --> 34:45.250
I knew what was ahead.
I guess..

34:47.667 --> 34:49.208
I guess I was afraid.

34:50.333 --> 34:53.125
When you've lived
as long as I have, you..

34:53.208 --> 34:55.417
...you kind of get used to it.

34:57.292 --> 34:58.417
Uh..

34:59.708 --> 35:02.167
I wish I could have
done more for you.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.667
Uh, there's so much
I should have said and..

35:05.792 --> 35:07.708
Now it's too late.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.333
You're right.

35:12.417 --> 35:15.250
It's time you begin fighting
this war your way.

35:16.417 --> 35:18.125
[groans]

35:18.208 --> 35:21.458
- I've got to go now, John.
- No, no. Don't, don't leave.

35:22.792 --> 35:25.792
It's, it's alright, son.

35:25.875 --> 35:29.708
See, as long as you're here..

35:31.042 --> 35:32.917
...I'll always be here.

35:34.792 --> 35:37.833
[zapping]

35:43.500 --> 35:44.708
Kosh.

35:45.625 --> 35:46.917
Kosh.

36:03.542 --> 36:05.208
Uh, my people going over Kosh's
place with a fine-toothed comb

36:05.292 --> 36:07.333
but we've got nothing.

36:07.417 --> 36:11.208
No sign of forced entry,
no prints, no DNA fragments.

36:11.292 --> 36:14.167
The place looks like
it's been through a war.

36:14.250 --> 36:17.250
- No sign of a body.
- You will not find one.

36:18.208 --> 36:19.458
Then how do you know he's dead?

36:19.542 --> 36:21.250
I know.

36:21.333 --> 36:24.750
So do the Vorlons, somehow.

36:24.833 --> 36:27.750
They asked us to keep this
to ourselves.

36:27.833 --> 36:30.625
They grieve for the death
of Kosh as much as we do

36:30.708 --> 36:32.333
but they know that
the alliance we have formed

36:32.417 --> 36:34.833
with the other worlds
is young and fragile.

36:34.917 --> 36:37.292
News of his passing
could destroy it.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.458
It was not uncommon
for Kosh to go unseen

36:41.542 --> 36:43.083
for weeks at a time.

36:43.167 --> 36:46.250
That gives the Vorlons enough
time to send a replacement.

36:46.333 --> 36:48.417
No one will know.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.083
He must have known
this would happen

36:51.167 --> 36:53.250
as soon as the Vorlons
got directly involved.

36:53.333 --> 36:55.417
That's what he meant
when he said

36:55.500 --> 36:57.667
that he wouldn't be there
for me later.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.792
I thought he was angry.

37:02.875 --> 37:04.833
Trying to punish me.

37:05.958 --> 37:08.083
But he was afraid.

37:08.167 --> 37:10.250
You look at him and..

37:11.542 --> 37:14.417
...never would think
he could be afraid.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.375
The Vorlon government
made one final request.

37:19.417 --> 37:23.208
They asked
that his encounter suit..

37:25.042 --> 37:26.875
...everything that was his..

37:28.208 --> 37:30.292
...be placed in his ship.

37:33.208 --> 37:34.708
(Garibaldi)
'And then what?'

37:36.667 --> 37:38.333
It was poison.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.667
As I suspected.

37:44.333 --> 37:47.000
And I believe you know
something about this.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.292
Last thing I heard
from Lord Refa was that

37:50.375 --> 37:52.833
he was very upset with you.

37:52.917 --> 37:56.000
Understandable. You did try
to poison him after all.

37:58.083 --> 38:02.083
He mentioned something
about evening the score.

38:02.167 --> 38:03.833
'I wasn't able to find out
what he was planning'

38:03.917 --> 38:07.625
because he stopped talking
to me right after that

38:07.708 --> 38:09.292
at your urging.

38:11.375 --> 38:13.417
If I had stayed
in contact with him

38:13.500 --> 38:15.292
sooner or later, I'd have
found out what he was up to

38:15.375 --> 38:17.333
and I could have stopped him.

38:18.583 --> 38:22.458
No sentimental reasons.
It's just...inefficient.

38:26.875 --> 38:28.958
I'm terribly sorry, Londo.
I-I..

38:30.458 --> 38:32.375
Is that why you called me here?

38:39.667 --> 38:41.750
I gave this to her.

38:43.125 --> 38:46.708
Told her to wear it
proudly as a free woman.

38:48.958 --> 38:51.792
I might as well have
signed her death warrant.

38:54.958 --> 38:58.958
Everyone around me dies,
Mr. Morden.

38:59.042 --> 39:01.625
Except the ones
that most deserve it.

39:03.417 --> 39:05.708
That is about to change.

39:09.208 --> 39:12.917
You said that you would go away
for as long as I wanted.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.750
I no longer want that.

39:14.833 --> 39:19.583
All I want now is revenge.

39:19.667 --> 39:22.333
They took from me..

39:22.417 --> 39:27.292
...the one thing that I have,
have ever truly loved.

39:29.542 --> 39:33.167
And you will help me,
Mr. Morden, to strike them down.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.167
Give me this

39:38.250 --> 39:40.792
and the safety of my people..

39:42.750 --> 39:45.875
...and let the rest
of the galaxy burn.

39:45.958 --> 39:47.875
I don't care anymore.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.625
Will you help me, Mr. Morden?

39:54.750 --> 39:57.250
Of course, ambassador.

39:58.625 --> 40:01.083
As ever, I am always
in your service.

40:07.875 --> 40:08.917
Doc.

40:10.750 --> 40:13.875
Garibaldi said you wanted
to see me privately.

40:13.958 --> 40:15.417
Yes, I did.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.125
Maybe you've noticed,
maybe you haven't

40:19.208 --> 40:21.000
but I haven't been doing
as good a job around here

40:21.083 --> 40:23.542
as I should have.

40:23.625 --> 40:26.417
I kept wanting to do more
and I ended up doing less.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.708
It's ironic, you know?

40:29.792 --> 40:32.458
When I look in the mirror,
I don't see me.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.167
I see the job.

40:35.250 --> 40:37.792
I was the job.
Nothin' else mattered.

40:39.500 --> 40:42.042
I haven't been on a date.
I haven't, I haven't seen a vid.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.375
I-I-I haven't just sat
and listened to music

40:44.458 --> 40:45.833
in-in I don't know how long.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.833
- Stephen, I have--
- Wait, wait, let me finish.

40:47.917 --> 40:52.250
Because if I stop, I'm afraid
I'm not gonna get through this.

40:52.333 --> 40:56.583
- Alright.
- I've been taking stims, John.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.583
A lot of them. Too many.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.250
Because they kept me busy.

41:02.333 --> 41:04.750
They, they, they kept me
from lookin' in the mirror

41:04.833 --> 41:06.875
and realizing that I do not know

41:06.958 --> 41:09.333
who was looking back at me.

41:09.417 --> 41:12.583
I was so obsessed with fixing
other people's problems

41:12.667 --> 41:15.042
because I was afraid
to face my own.

41:16.458 --> 41:19.125
I don't think I have
that luxury anymore.

41:21.833 --> 41:24.125
Now I can keep lying to myself..

41:25.292 --> 41:27.250
...till something
goes wrong..

41:28.792 --> 41:30.083
...somebody dies.

41:32.292 --> 41:35.333
Or I can stop now.

41:35.417 --> 41:38.458
Leave the job before you're
forced to take it away from me.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.250
So effective immediately,
I am resigning

41:42.333 --> 41:45.000
as chief of staff
of the Medlab facility.

41:46.792 --> 41:49.083
I'm not sure
what I'm gonna do.

41:50.125 --> 41:52.458
I guess I'll, uh, figure it out.

41:52.542 --> 41:53.875
Look--

41:53.958 --> 41:56.583
I've got a lot to figure out

41:56.667 --> 41:59.042
and it's time I got started.

42:22.375 --> 42:24.417
(Garibaldi)
And then what?

42:24.500 --> 42:29.125
(Delenn)
Then once Kosh's belongings
are loaded into his ship

42:29.208 --> 42:31.958
it will activate itself.

42:32.042 --> 42:34.750
The ship was made for him.

42:34.833 --> 42:37.125
It was a part of him.

42:37.208 --> 42:40.833
In a curious way,
it is alive.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.792
It cannot live without him.

42:44.917 --> 42:48.292
So it will grieve as we do

42:48.375 --> 42:50.167
in its own way..

42:51.250 --> 42:53.583
...and perform its last duty..

42:54.875 --> 42:56.958
...in memory of Kosh.

43:04.417 --> 43:06.833
