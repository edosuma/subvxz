Ah, hmm, looks like Jimmy
Pesto's big Super Bowl weekend

00:24.088 --> 00:25.755
is starting early.

00:25.756 --> 00:27.290
No, no, no.
Higher.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.292
Every year it starts
earlier and earlier.

00:29.293 --> 00:31.127
Like ant season
under Gene's bed.

00:31.128 --> 00:33.296
I'm having my own Super Bowl
blowout this year.

00:33.297 --> 00:35.632
I'm holding all of my BMs
until halftime,

00:35.633 --> 00:37.801
when I will make
a Super Bowel!

00:37.802 --> 00:39.469
Gene, you can't hold
your poops in, all right?

00:39.470 --> 00:41.938
You got to set 'em free
where they can go down the sewer

00:41.939 --> 00:43.573
and they find their families
and they're happy!

00:43.574 --> 00:45.642
I'm their family!
I raised them!

00:45.643 --> 00:48.178
Hey, you know what? We should do
our own Super Bowl promotion.

00:48.179 --> 00:49.913
You know, for people
who want the option

00:49.914 --> 00:51.247
to have <i>good</i> food.

00:51.248 --> 00:52.849
Great idea, Dad.
We can have people over

00:52.850 --> 00:54.985
and order a bunch of Thai.
What? No, Tina.

00:54.986 --> 00:56.620
I'm talking
about <i>our</i> food.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.321
Oh, right.
That'll work, too.

00:58.322 --> 00:59.923
Hmm?

00:59.924 --> 01:01.358
What's that jerk up to?

01:01.359 --> 01:02.592
(bell jingles)

01:02.593 --> 01:04.194
Ugh. What do you
want, Jimmy?

01:04.194 --> 01:06.096
Hey, saw your little sign.
What are you gonna do,

01:06.097 --> 01:08.164
listen to the game
on the radio and then go out

01:08.165 --> 01:09.820
and tell everybody
what happened? Come on.

01:09.834 --> 01:12.168
What are you talking about?
You don't have a TV!

01:12.169 --> 01:14.037
Yeah, we do.
It's right there. Right there.

01:14.038 --> 01:16.606
Where? I don't s...
Uh, where? Oh, yeah!

01:16.607 --> 01:17.841
Little fella.

01:17.842 --> 01:19.843
Yeah! And it has
good horizontal hold!

01:19.844 --> 01:21.478
Sheesh! How old
is that thing?

01:21.479 --> 01:23.613
The players are all gonna
have English accents.

01:23.614 --> 01:25.315
Ah! 'Cause
England's old.

01:25.316 --> 01:26.650
Don't hold my hand.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.151
Get out of here, Jimmy.
Yeah.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.719
It's no wonder
every year my place

01:29.720 --> 01:32.188
is packed for the game,
while you serve two customers.

01:32.189 --> 01:33.957
He's talking about us.
Look alive, Mort!

01:33.958 --> 01:35.392
Oh, yeah?
Well-well, we have

01:35.393 --> 01:37.527
our own Super Bowl idea, Jimmy.
Yeah!

01:37.528 --> 01:38.862
Is it
my Super Bowel?

01:38.863 --> 01:40.497
Bigger.
Impossible!

01:40.498 --> 01:42.232
Our idea's gonna
get us more business

01:42.233 --> 01:43.299
on Sunday than you.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.801
Yeah, that's right,
yeah.

01:44.802 --> 01:46.503
You go, Dad.
Our place will be packed,

01:46.504 --> 01:48.805
and yours will be empty.
Ha!

01:48.806 --> 01:49.873
Like Trev's soul.

01:49.874 --> 01:51.007
Heh. Whoa.

01:51.008 --> 01:52.308
I'm sorry.
(groans)

01:52.309 --> 01:53.877
That's cute that
you think that, Bob.

01:53.878 --> 01:55.912
Almost as cute as your
little cooking booties.

01:55.913 --> 01:57.914
(gasps) They happen
to be clogs, Jimmy.

01:57.915 --> 01:59.749
Yeah? Well, go back
to Holland, you windmill!

01:59.750 --> 02:01.985
He's not a windmill.
You'll see, Jimmy.

02:01.986 --> 02:03.887
My idea's gonna destroy you.

02:03.888 --> 02:06.523
Monday morning, you're gonna be
like, "What the hell happened?"

02:06.524 --> 02:09.491
and I'm gonna be like,
"Bob's idea happened!"

02:09.493 --> 02:11.828
So, what do you got, Bob?
I got nothing.

02:11.829 --> 02:13.329
Aw, nuts.
No, Dad,

02:13.330 --> 02:15.432
<i>we've</i> got nothing.
Thanks, Tina.

02:15.433 --> 02:17.434
Here's something.
It's a grocery list.

02:17.435 --> 02:20.236
Hurry back, and I'll make
zucchini and wienie paninis.

02:20.237 --> 02:21.705
You'll love 'em.
Yay.

02:21.706 --> 02:22.906
Yay.

02:22.907 --> 02:24.107
What am I gonna do

02:24.108 --> 02:25.542
to bring in more business?

02:25.543 --> 02:27.377
Can't let Pesto win. Again.

02:27.378 --> 02:28.678
(high-pitched):
I have an idea.

02:28.679 --> 02:30.146
(normal voice):
What is it, zucchini?

02:30.181 --> 02:31.681
(high-pitched):
You could kill Jimmy Pesto.

02:31.682 --> 02:33.016
(normal):
Yeah, I could kill him.

02:33.017 --> 02:34.184
(high-pitched):
Yeah, kill him today...

02:34.185 --> 02:35.585
with <i>me.</i>

02:35.586 --> 02:37.187
Shove me down his throat.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.588
(normal):
That's a great idea.

02:38.589 --> 02:40.256
No one...
It's a perfect murder.

02:40.257 --> 02:42.392
(high-pitched):
Watch out for that truck!

02:42.393 --> 02:43.893
(normal):
Or...

02:43.894 --> 02:46.096
(high-pitched):
Or what?

02:46.130 --> 02:48.698
(normal): Nothing. Forget it.
Just go back in the bag.

02:50.134 --> 02:51.735
A 15-second local
Super Bowl commercial

02:51.736 --> 02:53.636
is only $3,000.

02:53.637 --> 02:55.371
We can afford it, barely.

02:55.372 --> 02:56.940
I don't know, Bob.

02:56.941 --> 02:58.408
We'd have to empty
almost all our savings.

02:58.409 --> 03:00.243
What if it doesn't work?
It <i>will</i> work.

03:00.244 --> 03:02.746
When everyone in the bi-county
area sees our commercial,

03:02.747 --> 03:04.280
they'll come
to our restaurant.

03:04.281 --> 03:06.950
I didn't know our county was bi.
Good for us.

03:06.951 --> 03:09.652
I'm telling you, Lin, we'll make
that money back and then some.

03:09.653 --> 03:11.955
This is just about you wanting
to one-up Jimmy Pesto.

03:11.956 --> 03:13.823
No, Lin. The fact
that our commercial

03:13.824 --> 03:16.893
will play on all of Jimmy
Pesto's stupid 18 televisions

03:16.894 --> 03:19.062
during the game
has nothing to do with it!

03:19.063 --> 03:20.630
Th-This is about growing
our family business.

03:20.631 --> 03:22.565
We'll get so big,
we'll run Mort off his land

03:22.566 --> 03:24.267
and take his goats!

03:24.268 --> 03:26.269
We'll get so rich, we'll
never be happy again!

03:26.270 --> 03:28.638
$3,000 is a lot
of money, Bobby.

03:28.639 --> 03:30.774
But a Super Bowl commercial
is a game-changer, Lin,

03:30.775 --> 03:32.295
and it'll be fun.

03:32.309 --> 03:34.110
No. We'll put
the whole family in it.

03:34.111 --> 03:36.780
No, I don't think...
You could sing a song.

This is an impressive
savings account here.

03:48.808 --> 03:50.209
And then here's yours.

03:50.243 --> 03:51.443
See the difference?
Yes.

03:51.477 --> 03:53.078
Good planning;
Careful saving.

03:53.079 --> 03:56.515
No apparent plan;
Small, random deposits.

03:56.549 --> 03:57.983
Yes, I-I, uh, I get it.

03:58.017 --> 03:59.451
Something. Nothing.

03:59.485 --> 04:00.819
Okay, you've made your point.

04:00.853 --> 04:02.554
Good. I mean, I
shouldn't even be

04:02.555 --> 04:03.755
showing you this other account,
but I couldn't think

04:03.756 --> 04:05.157
of another way to
try to help you.

04:05.158 --> 04:06.725
Well, actually,
it's kind of hurtful.

04:06.759 --> 04:08.560
Aw. Yes,
I'm basically emptying our account,

04:08.561 --> 04:10.062
but it's worth it to have

04:10.063 --> 04:11.964
a commercial
during the Super Bowl.

04:11.998 --> 04:13.365
I mean, I'll be back in here

04:13.366 --> 04:15.133

depositing twice as much.

04:15.168 --> 04:18.103
Oh, that'll be fun.
I'll have our vault enlarged.

04:18.103 --> 04:21.072
Okay, uh, financing
is in place.

04:21.074 --> 04:24.409
Now we just need a $3,000 idea
for the family commercial.

04:24.410 --> 04:25.611
So, uh, let's do it.

04:25.612 --> 04:27.246
What do we got?
Bobby, I know

04:27.280 --> 04:29.915
a guy who used to be in the NFL;
I bet you could get him.

04:29.949 --> 04:31.730
Really? That could be great.

04:31.751 --> 04:33.585
I don't know.
Celebrity endorsement?

04:33.586 --> 04:35.187
Sounds a little hoity-toity.

04:35.188 --> 04:37.022
Yeah, that might be
a little slick for us.

04:37.023 --> 04:38.090
It's something
Pesto would do.

04:38.091 --> 04:39.291
We'll keep it simple...

04:39.292 --> 04:40.826
just the food
and the family.

04:40.860 --> 04:42.728
How about a slogan?
Uh, "Where's the burger?

04:42.729 --> 04:44.329
Between Bob's buns."
(makes fart noise)

04:44.364 --> 04:45.797
Hmm. Uh, well, not that.

04:45.798 --> 04:47.199
How about this?

04:47.200 --> 04:49.067
"Bob's Burgers,
like a beef in the night."

04:49.068 --> 04:50.369

Huh.

04:50.403 --> 04:52.204

04:53.539 --> 04:56.241
Um, how about, uh,
"I beef, you beef,

we'll all beef, uh,
at Bob's Burgers."

04:58.444 --> 04:59.778

Hey, buddy.
Hello, Belchers.

06:23.196 --> 06:24.396
(others shout greetings)

06:24.397 --> 06:25.397

What?

06:25.398 --> 06:26.698
Nothing. Hey, uh,

06:26.733 --> 06:28.133
what did you think
about the script?

06:28.134 --> 06:30.035
What did I think
about the script?

06:30.036 --> 06:32.337
Oh, quick question:
Did a kid write it?

06:32.338 --> 06:34.306
Actually, yes.
This kid. Me.

06:34.307 --> 06:35.807
And just to explain
who's in charge,

06:35.808 --> 06:37.063
this is a point-and-
shoot operation;

06:37.076 --> 06:38.744

06:38.745 --> 06:40.712
Well, we will

06:40.713 --> 06:42.881
No, I'm the puppet master,
and you're the guy

who gets the puppet master
a glass of water.

06:44.984 --> 06:46.918
Uh, puppets can't get water

06:46.919 --> 06:48.520

Oh, yeah, I remember.

10:28.622 --> 10:30.523
Every time
he sacked a quarterback,

10:30.524 --> 10:31.957
he'd celebrate
by doing the can-can.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.392
That was his thing.

10:33.393 --> 10:34.593

11:05.091 --> 11:06.625

order an NFL legend?

11:17.304 --> 11:19.071

they did not,

11:19.072 --> 11:20.639

13:59.833 --> 14:02.301
than wearing my shirt backwards
at school that one time.

14:02.302 --> 14:05.671
At Bob's Burgers, we only use
the freshest ingredients,

14:05.672 --> 14:07.840
and we grind our meat
right here.

14:07.841 --> 14:11.176
Mmm. That's a ten-yard penalty
for unnecessary deliciousness.

14:11.177 --> 14:14.346
Hey, you're NFL great
Sandy Can-Can Frye.

14:14.347 --> 14:15.948
And you're Bob.

14:15.949 --> 14:17.483
Come see me here
after the Super Bowl.

14:17.484 --> 14:18.851
He'll give you

14:18.852 --> 14:20.486
the best burger
you've ever had,

14:20.520 --> 14:22.354
and I'll give you a high five.

14:22.355 --> 14:25.357
Tell me, Sandy. Why do you like
Bob's Burgers so much?

14:25.358 --> 14:28.861
Because Bob's Burgers
goes great with Frye.

14:29.863 --> 14:31.630
(festive music playing)

14:31.631 --> 14:33.532
(grunting)

14:33.533 --> 14:35.768
BOB: <i>Bob's Burgers, conveniently
located on Ocean Avenue.</i>

14:35.769 --> 14:38.103
<i>Open Monday through</i> "Frye" <i>day.</i>

14:38.104 --> 14:39.138
<i>Also Saturday and Sunday.</i>

14:39.172 --> 14:40.339
Can-can!

14:40.373 --> 14:41.807
Wow! That turned out great!

14:41.808 --> 14:43.542
But the family
was barely in it!

14:43.543 --> 14:45.210
You didn't even
show my hair flip.

14:45.211 --> 14:48.180
And where was the Giant
Burger Boy who pees mustard?

14:48.181 --> 14:49.615
The star of
the commercial!

14:49.616 --> 14:52.017
You cut out all
of the singing!

14:52.018 --> 14:53.352
All of it!
I to you!

14:53.353 --> 14:54.853
Dad threw us
under the bus!

14:54.854 --> 14:56.855
Hey, I understand
you're all disappointed,

14:56.856 --> 14:59.191
but Randy and I thought
this was the best way to go,

14:59.192 --> 15:01.193
and Sandy is so great
and likeable that... Dah.

15:01.227 --> 15:02.828
Is this what
you wanted, Dad?

15:02.829 --> 15:04.897
All you had
to do was ask!

15:04.898 --> 15:06.614
Yeah, Dad. Happy now?
(rhythmic grunting)

15:06.633 --> 15:08.901
No. I mean, yes,
about our commercial.

15:08.902 --> 15:10.302
But no, no.

15:10.303 --> 15:12.037
Get used
to it, Dad!

15:12.072 --> 15:15.107
This is all we can-can do
from now on! (grunting)

15:15.141 --> 15:17.476
Yeah... Bob! (grunting)

15:17.477 --> 15:21.914
Oh, yeah? Well, this is what's
going to get us customers!

15:21.915 --> 15:23.297
(all grunting)

15:23.316 --> 15:27.319
How long are we
going to can-can?

15:27.320 --> 15:28.678
'Cause this is hurting.

15:28.688 --> 15:31.156
It doesn't end!
You do it till you die!

15:31.191 --> 15:32.991
Yeah!
Ow! Ow!

15:32.992 --> 15:35.027
Hey, look.
Sandy is still on TV! What?

15:35.061 --> 15:37.663
JIMMY: So, Sandy Frye,
why will you be at Jimmy Pesto's

15:37.664 --> 15:39.698
signing autographs during
and after the Super Bowl?

15:39.699 --> 15:42.434
You know, instead of at some
stupid greasy burger shack?

15:42.435 --> 15:45.037
Because Jimmy Pesto's pizza
goes great with Frye.

15:45.038 --> 15:46.505
All right.

15:46.539 --> 15:48.874
(screaming)

15:48.875 --> 15:51.677
What the hell?!
That doesn't even make sense!

15:51.678 --> 15:54.213
Pizza doesn't go well
with Frye!

15:55.785 --> 15:57.386
BOB:
I don't believe it.

15:57.387 --> 15:58.954
Pesto stole
our commercial.

15:58.989 --> 16:01.056
We're sunk.
He beat us again!

16:01.057 --> 16:03.225
Who's us? The family
you turned your back on?

16:03.226 --> 16:05.094
Yeah, now you know
how we feel, Bob.

16:05.095 --> 16:06.495
The betrayer
is betrayed.

16:06.496 --> 16:08.397
Karma's a bitch,
and then you die.

16:08.398 --> 16:11.100
I'm so upset I don't even have
to go to the bathroom anymore.

16:11.101 --> 16:12.735
Either that, or maybe
I'm going right now.

16:12.736 --> 16:14.937
Oh, I really do still
have to go quite a bit.

16:14.938 --> 16:16.305
What are you doing?

16:16.339 --> 16:18.140
I'm gonna go settle up
with Pesto!

16:18.141 --> 16:20.109
God. I can't get this apron off!

16:20.110 --> 16:22.444
Stop. You're like a mental
patient in a straitjacket.

16:22.445 --> 16:24.079
Tina, untie the back!

16:24.080 --> 16:25.514
Karma's a bitch.
Oh, my God!

16:25.515 --> 16:27.983
Forget it!
I'll wear it over there!

16:29.686 --> 16:32.154
Ah, great commercial, Bob.

16:32.155 --> 16:33.956
I'm being sarcastic.
It was terrible.

16:33.957 --> 16:36.692
Ta... You... you
never support me!

16:36.693 --> 16:38.093
Mm.
Randy!

16:38.094 --> 16:39.762
Mm! I always watch
the game here, Bob!

16:42.299 --> 16:44.500
You!
Down in front!

16:44.534 --> 16:46.468
Yeah! Down in
front, Front Butt!

16:46.469 --> 16:49.138
Yeah, you make a better door
than a window, and you're fat!

16:49.139 --> 16:51.173
(laughs)
Classic.

16:51.174 --> 16:52.808
You stole my commercial, Jimmy!

16:52.809 --> 16:54.472
You stole... him!

16:54.477 --> 16:56.345
Oh, hey, Bob! Pizza?

16:56.346 --> 16:57.880
No, I don't want pizza!

16:57.881 --> 16:59.214
I'm angry at you!

16:59.215 --> 17:00.983
Oh, because of the commercial?

17:00.984 --> 17:02.985
Yes! Sandy, how could you?

17:02.986 --> 17:04.819
Before you reject
my olive branch,

17:04.820 --> 17:07.056
which is pizza with olives,
let me explain.

17:07.057 --> 17:09.692
<i>After I finished shooting
your commercial, I came here</i>

17:09.693 --> 17:11.727
<i>to get some imaginative
appetizers and some pizza...</i>

17:11.728 --> 17:15.230
<i>two things you don't serve...
and I may have told Jimmy Pesto</i>

17:15.231 --> 17:17.499
<i>that I'm an actor now
and I had just shot</i>

17:17.500 --> 17:20.301
<i>a commercial with you
to air during the Super Bowl.</i>

17:20.303 --> 17:22.204
Which, in hindsight,
is probably how

17:22.204 --> 17:24.138
Jimmy got the idea
to do one himself.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.808
With the same tag line.

17:25.809 --> 17:27.509
But I hired you first!

17:27.510 --> 17:29.845
If I hurt your feelings,
or broke a contract with you,

17:29.846 --> 17:31.513
that was an honest mistake.

17:31.514 --> 17:33.415
Live and learn.
Yeah, Bob.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.651
Live and learn,
and lose. Again!

17:35.652 --> 17:37.820
All right, that's it! (grunts)

17:37.821 --> 17:39.421
Unplug! Unplug!

17:39.422 --> 17:41.824
(crowd groaning)
No, not my satellites!

17:41.825 --> 17:43.525
(grunts) Stay calm, everyone.

17:43.526 --> 17:46.328
I'll have 'em back on
in a second. (laughs)

17:46.329 --> 17:47.896
MAN: Hey, that's
that guy from that commercial!

17:47.897 --> 17:50.199
Oh, good.
You saw my commercial.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.101
You copied Pesto!
What?! No!

17:52.102 --> 17:54.336
I did it first!
Pesto copied me!

17:54.337 --> 17:55.771
Cry-baby copycat!

17:55.772 --> 17:57.873
(laughs):
Cry-baby copycat!

17:57.874 --> 18:00.442
No! The commercial
with Sandy was my idea!

18:00.443 --> 18:02.911
And Jimmy Pesto stole it!

18:02.912 --> 18:04.346
(grunting)

18:04.347 --> 18:05.914
Stop throwing food at me!

18:05.915 --> 18:07.883
Wow, it's getting
physical over there.

18:07.884 --> 18:10.285
Let's just remember him
as he was and move on.

18:10.286 --> 18:11.720
Well, can't
leave him there.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.122
Come on,
let's go get him.

18:13.123 --> 18:14.690
Fine.

18:14.691 --> 18:16.925
Wait. Let's let him get hit
by one more meatball.

18:16.926 --> 18:18.360
There it is.
Okay, let's go.

18:18.361 --> 18:19.795
I'd go with you,
but I don't want

18:19.796 --> 18:21.296
to give up my seat.
It's a good spot.

18:21.297 --> 18:22.965
Nah! Stop it!

18:22.966 --> 18:24.433
Nah... Ow!

18:24.467 --> 18:25.901
This guy, am I right?

18:25.902 --> 18:27.636
Anyway, would you
like to see an outtake

18:27.637 --> 18:29.038
from our family
commercial?

18:29.039 --> 18:31.140
Uh... sure?
Mm. Did I wow you?

18:31.141 --> 18:32.941
I guess.
Yes.

18:32.942 --> 18:34.476
Ow! Come on!

18:34.477 --> 18:35.611
36 percent!

18:35.612 --> 18:37.046
Oh, my God.

18:37.047 --> 18:38.714
None of this
ever should have happened.

18:38.715 --> 18:40.716
I-I made a great commercial
with my family.

18:40.717 --> 18:42.217
It was funny and cute.

18:42.218 --> 18:44.386
Well, it wasn't that funny,
but it was good.

18:44.387 --> 18:45.921
Well, it wasn't that good,

18:45.922 --> 18:47.423
but... but
it was us.

18:47.424 --> 18:49.124
And I scrapped it
to make a commercial

18:49.125 --> 18:50.793
I thought
would get more customers.

18:50.794 --> 18:52.061
I never should have done that.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.962
Ha-ha, 59%, folks!

18:53.963 --> 18:55.764
(clapping)
Thank you, Sandy.

18:55.765 --> 18:58.100
Oh, no, I was just
responding to the 59%.

18:58.101 --> 18:59.501
JIMMY: 62! Don't you...

18:59.502 --> 19:00.269
Don't...

19:00.270 --> 19:01.670
No! No!

19:01.671 --> 19:03.105
Don't clap for that!
Listen!

19:03.106 --> 19:04.773
Listen to me!

19:04.774 --> 19:06.909
I-I made a terrible commercial,
but my food's good.

19:06.910 --> 19:08.977
You should try it... someday.

19:08.978 --> 19:10.412
They're back on!
They're back on!

19:10.413 --> 19:11.814
The TVs are on, everybody!

19:11.815 --> 19:13.182
Ha, ha! The game!
All right!

19:13.183 --> 19:14.917
Now, you, get
out of here!

19:14.918 --> 19:16.752
Go stand on your own
counter; It's already dirty.

19:16.786 --> 19:17.786
Yeah, Bobby, let's go.

19:17.787 --> 19:18.854
Linda! Kids!

19:18.855 --> 19:20.255
We heard every
word, Bob.

19:20.256 --> 19:21.657
That was beautiful.

19:21.658 --> 19:23.158
Took you
a while to get there,

19:23.159 --> 19:24.960
but you finally realized
I was right.

19:24.961 --> 19:26.328
As always.

19:26.329 --> 19:27.763
That was just
so moving.

19:27.764 --> 19:29.098
Speaking of moving,

19:29.132 --> 19:30.599
I think
my butt water broke!

19:30.600 --> 19:32.267
I'll be right
back. Don't go!

19:32.268 --> 19:33.802
Gene, wait.

19:33.803 --> 19:35.304
Thought you were leaving.
We're going to.

19:35.305 --> 19:37.106
Gene just had to use
your stupid bathroom.

19:37.107 --> 19:38.507
It's for customers only!

19:38.508 --> 19:39.942
Can I get
a Pesto Colada?

19:39.943 --> 19:41.543
Lin!
What?

19:43.613 --> 19:45.447
I'm sorry I couldn't hold you
until halftime.

19:45.448 --> 19:47.449
If I did, I can only imagine

19:47.450 --> 19:49.351
you'd be an even <i>more</i>
Super Bowel.

19:49.352 --> 19:51.019
We'll try it again next year.

19:51.020 --> 19:52.454
Good-bye, handsome.

19:52.455 --> 19:53.856
You look like a fighter.

19:53.857 --> 19:56.225
I hope you go down.

19:58.027 --> 19:59.728
I kept flushing!
I kept flushing!

19:59.729 --> 20:01.130
Oh, my God!

20:01.131 --> 20:02.531
You kept
flushing what?

20:02.532 --> 20:04.333
What happened?
What-what happened?

20:04.334 --> 20:06.401
He's a fighter. He's a
fighter. We have to move.

20:06.402 --> 20:07.836
(gasps)
Gene's super bowel.

20:07.837 --> 20:10.139
Oh, you kept flushing the toilet.
Oh, no.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.840
(water rumbling)

20:14.129 --> 20:15.144
(crowd screaming)

20:15.145 --> 20:17.312
Aah, gross! Ew!

20:17.313 --> 20:19.148
Oh, my God! Go!
Save yourselves!

20:19.149 --> 20:20.749
Just remember me!

20:20.750 --> 20:22.151
Tell them what happened today!

20:22.152 --> 20:24.052
My heart will go on!

20:24.053 --> 20:26.555
Oh, hey, there's my commercial
for Tran's Noodles.

20:26.556 --> 20:29.224
'Cause Tran's Noodles go great
with Frye.

20:29.225 --> 20:31.260
I was in a lot
of commercials today.

20:31.261 --> 20:33.028
Oh, my God,
they're all leaving Pesto's!

20:33.029 --> 20:35.097
They'll have to come
to us! We'll be packed!

20:35.098 --> 20:37.166
Well, three people.
