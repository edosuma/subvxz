Come on down to the hall,

The greatest game

(lisping) Is this going to be on the test?

00:56.125 --> 00:57.625
We gotta get out of here.

00:57.709 --> 01:01.125
I heard there's a code
that lets you kick graves!

01:01.208 --> 01:03.667
-Kick graves, Cunningham!
-Way ahead of you.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.542
All I need is some
chewed gum, a pencil,

01:05.625 --> 01:07.083
and that thing flute girl plays.

01:07.166 --> 01:08.333
(gasps) My flute!

01:09.834 --> 01:12.041
-(grunts) Hmm?
-Check it.

01:12.125 --> 01:15.083
I'll shoot the clock, move
the hand to the end of the day,

01:15.166 --> 01:18.333
and, boom, we'll be
co-op grave punching in no time.

01:18.417 --> 01:21.750
That is just half
thought out enough to work!

Attention, students.
Due to the loss of power

01:31.750 --> 01:35.458
and resulting spooky darkness,
classes are dismissed.

01:35.542 --> 01:39.625
Freezer's busted! Anyone want free
ice cream sammies?

01:39.709 --> 01:40.875
-Whoo!

01:40.959 --> 01:43.583

01:43.667 --> 01:45.959
Howard, let's... Howard? Hmm?

01:46.041 --> 01:48.333
I would've got you one,

01:56.458 --> 01:58.917
-(growling)
-(laughs) Did you ever think

01:59.000 --> 02:00.750
I could eat 15 ice cream sandwiches?

02:00.834 --> 02:03.583
-I didn't.
-You know those are made of tofu.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.792
Shh! Not in front of my stomach.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.542
(Greg) The <i>Grave Puncher 5</i>
is the game for you!

02:08.625 --> 02:11.417
But you better hurry. Only nine left!

02:11.500 --> 02:14.417
Nine? There were 200 five minutes ago!

02:14.500 --> 02:16.208
Howard, baby, relax.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.917
Nothing is going to
come between our fists

02:19.000 --> 02:21.417
-and those sweet, sweet graves.
-(screaming)

02:21.500 --> 02:25.125
(roaring) Tawny!

02:25.208 --> 02:27.208
Sorry to interrupt your rampaging,

02:27.291 --> 02:30.583
but Norrisville High is now
a monster-free campus.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.500
It probably missed the signage.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.375
-(roars)
-Huh?

02:34.458 --> 02:36.166
-Howard...
-I know what you're gonna say.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.458
-And you're right.
-Huh?

02:37.542 --> 02:41.000
We can get to Greg's and back
before that monster does anything major!

02:41.083 --> 02:45.417
-To the Gamehole! (humming)
-Not what I was gonna say.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.166
Come on! Slimovitz is all over this!

02:48.250 --> 02:53.333
Every part of my body
is either terrified or in pain!

02:53.417 --> 02:54.500
Sorry, buddy.

02:54.583 --> 02:58.125
Our quest must take a slight detour
through Ninja Town!

02:58.208 --> 03:01.500
Man, why does everything good
have to go through Ninja Town?

03:04.625 --> 03:05.917
Ha!

03:07.750 --> 03:09.583
How about we just skip
the roar playing,

03:09.667 --> 03:11.458
and just cut right to the fun stuff?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.208
-(exclaims)
-Yah!

03:14.291 --> 03:15.458
Ninja charge!

03:17.375 --> 03:20.583
-(roars, groans)
-Ah! Ow!

03:20.667 --> 03:22.875
-(roars)
-Uh...

03:22.959 --> 03:23.834
Ninja flip!

03:23.917 --> 03:25.959
Ah, stank corsage.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.709
Ninja snatch!

03:36.375 --> 03:39.333
Mmm. Now that is a classic.

03:39.417 --> 03:43.500
I haven't used this vintage
in quite some time.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.500
Whoo-hoo! What just happened?

03:45.583 --> 03:47.166
Where am I?

03:47.250 --> 03:50.000
You're a little disoriented.
That's just the stank-nesia.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.083
In like a second
you'll remember everything.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.208
I remember everything!

03:53.291 --> 03:55.417
I was waiting for
my prom date to show up,

03:55.500 --> 03:57.959
her name's Tawny,
she's a bodacious babe.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.125
We're talking foxy to the max here.

04:00.208 --> 04:03.375
Sounds good. Not sure what
it means, but thumbs up.

04:03.458 --> 04:06.458
Then she stood me up!
How totally bogus is that?

04:06.542 --> 04:09.375
I even bought her a purple
corsage to match her dress.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.250
I would've gotten a purple tux,
but I couldn't find one.

04:12.333 --> 04:16.250
Can you believe it?
You can't find a purple tux in 1985?

04:16.333 --> 04:19.667
-1980-what now?
-Hey nin... Hey, sharp suit.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.917
Don't you have somewhere to be,
like, I don't know, a Gamehole, maybe?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.875
Howard, this guy's from the past.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.834
I have to find a way to break it to him,
gently, that he's in the future.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.792
-I'm in the future? Wait.
-(gasps)

04:29.875 --> 04:31.542
Maybe they've invented time travel.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.583
They can pop me right back to 1985.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.417
Have they invented time travel?

04:35.500 --> 04:36.792
-No.
-(screams)

04:36.875 --> 04:39.000
I'm stuck in the future!

04:39.083 --> 04:40.750
Why is that typewriter so small?

04:40.834 --> 04:42.792
Why is that kid wearing wheel feet?

04:42.875 --> 04:44.375
(babbling) Ow!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.333
Why is that tree there?

04:46.417 --> 04:48.500
It wasn't there in 1985.

04:48.583 --> 04:52.875
Tawny! Oh! I've never felt so alone.

04:52.959 --> 04:57.125
-(sobbing)
-To the Gamehole!

04:57.208 --> 04:59.333
I can't just leave '80s kid like this.

04:59.417 --> 05:01.041
I have to figure out what's going on.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.458
-Mmm.
-Watch him until I get back.

05:02.542 --> 05:05.250
-Smoke bomb!
-Relax, kid.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.750
Uncle Howard's gonna tell you
everything you need to know

05:07.834 --> 05:09.792
about the future.
First, the spaceships

05:09.875 --> 05:11.291
are not as hard to fly as they look.

05:11.375 --> 05:14.709
Second, future air is pretty rank, so
breathe through your butt,

05:14.792 --> 05:18.041
and, finally, when you see
the monkey overlord, just bow.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.333
-(monkeys chittering)
-Do not look him in the eye.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.041
-Huh? Ugh! No.
-(toilet flushes)

05:25.125 --> 05:27.458
Okay, Nomicon, what
the juice is going on?

05:27.542 --> 05:28.458
(grunts)

05:31.583 --> 05:32.625
Ah!

05:33.291 --> 05:36.750
"The monster in the blue tux
by the ninja of 1985."

05:36.834 --> 05:38.166
Now we're talking.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.208
(man) <i>Prom night.</i>

05:44.875 --> 05:45.792

05:48.083 --> 05:50.083
<i>or put him on ice</i>
<i>and get back to the dance.</i>

05:51.000 --> 05:53.166
<i>So I locked him in the cafeteria freezer.</i>

05:53.250 --> 05:55.500
<i>If you're reading this,</i>
<i>I guess he got out.</i>

05:55.583 --> 05:57.917
<i>See you, wouldn't wanna be you.</i>

05:58.000 --> 06:00.333
That is some selfish
ninja-ing, right there.

06:00.417 --> 06:03.083
It's killing my afternoon of gameholing.

06:06.375 --> 06:09.208
"The knot not tied unravels."

06:09.291 --> 06:13.500
Whoa. Ninja of '85
totally left the monster in the freezer.

06:13.583 --> 06:14.750
Hey, where's '80s kid?

06:14.834 --> 06:17.000
His name is Dickie,
and he hates his parents.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.333
I'm assuming because
they named him "Dickie."

06:19.417 --> 06:21.000
Howard, where did he go?

06:21.083 --> 06:23.625
Uh, oh, he said he was
heading to the Gamehole.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.208
Hey, we should go after him!

06:25.291 --> 06:27.083

-(grunts)

06:29.625 --> 06:33.542

-Oh, Dickie! Dickie!

06:33.625 --> 06:36.125

(grunts) Randy Cunningham,
ninth grade phenom.

11:26.667 --> 11:29.333
First freshman ever to ride
in the Wave Slayer relays.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.917
Cunningham, through the shoots,
Cunningham, off the ramp.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.667
Cunningham something, something.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.375
-Cunningham! Cunningham!
-(Howard) Cunningham!

11:36.458 --> 11:38.250
-What was that for?
-For fantasizing

11:38.333 --> 11:40.166
when you're supposed to be waxing.

11:40.250 --> 11:44.125
-What was that for?
-For asking what that was for.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.959
Do you want to keep going,
or do you want to do your job?

11:47.709 --> 11:50.250
Howard, we did not join the
Wave Slayers to sit around

11:50.333 --> 11:51.792
waxing our water craft.

11:51.875 --> 11:56.041
-We did it to rock!
-No, that's why you did it.

11:56.125 --> 11:59.709
I joined for the executive
snack bar privileges.

11:59.792 --> 12:04.166
And BT Dubbs, it's quarter
past corndog. Where is Luigi?

12:04.250 --> 12:07.083
(Italian accent) I'm so sorry.
Luigi make it a promise.

12:07.166 --> 12:10.709
You Slayer Waves,
you no wait in the line.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.959
Luigi, you know what would
totally make this right?

12:13.041 --> 12:14.667
Cheese sauce.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.875
Right away, Senor Weinerman.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.500
-(feet screech)
-Mmm.

12:18.583 --> 12:22.208
Snack... bar... privileges.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.625
No. I can't take it.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.375
I was born to ride, Howard.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.959
-Huh?
-(Howard) What are you doing?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.250
That's Buttermaker's Wave Slayer.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.291
Relax, I'm just going to sit on it.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.000
Then why are you zipping that up?

12:35.083 --> 12:36.333
-Safety?
-(grumbles)

12:36.417 --> 12:40.875
Taking out the captain's
Slayer for a joyride is a really bad idea.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.792
(scoffs) Joyride? No, no, no, no.

12:42.875 --> 12:47.917
As team waxer, it is my solemn duty
to make sure the wax is evenly applied.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.375
(chuckles) Ah, duty.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.458
-(revving)
-(Randy chuckles)

12:54.291 --> 12:56.041
So Bruce!

12:56.125 --> 12:58.583
Howard, sometimes
you just gotta say...

12:58.667 --> 12:59.917
...what the juice.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.709
-(crashing)
-What the juice?

13:03.792 --> 13:06.250
When Coach Green sees this,
he'll kick us off the team!

13:06.333 --> 13:09.917
If I lose my snack bar
privileges, so help me.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.750
I can fix this. Aah! Aah! I can fix this!

13:16.000 --> 13:18.291
Just a little more wax...

13:18.375 --> 13:19.875
Yeah, as long as nobody looks at it,

13:19.959 --> 13:23.166
-I don't think they'll notice.
-(approaching laughter)

13:23.250 --> 13:26.208
(up-tempo music plays)

13:27.250 --> 13:28.458
(humming)

13:28.542 --> 13:32.250
Men, today we give
those Flackville handshakers

13:32.333 --> 13:34.000
a proper thwacking!

13:34.083 --> 13:36.792
-Yeah!
-Now, into the brine

13:36.875 --> 13:39.750
for your preliminary hydro zigzaggery.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.333
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

13:43.875 --> 13:45.375
Just go warm up.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.500
-Shucks away!
-Yeah!

13:48.375 --> 13:50.792
-Oh, hey, Buttermaker.
-Hey, hey, RC!

13:50.875 --> 13:53.625
My baby waxed to the max?
Gotta get my pre-race on!

13:53.709 --> 13:55.834
Oh, right, maybe
you could just chill on the dock, and,

13:55.917 --> 13:59.625
I'm just spitballing here,
you could visualize your pre-race, right?

13:59.709 --> 14:02.333
(chuckling) You know my philosophy.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.125
Slay it, don't say it.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's this?

14:05.834 --> 14:07.291
Yeah, I guess I should tell you...

14:07.375 --> 14:10.291
My seat! I can see my face in it!

14:10.375 --> 14:13.333
Oh, tasty! You, dude, were born to buff!

14:13.417 --> 14:14.667
Hmm.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.709
What's you want to tell me, RC?

14:16.792 --> 14:18.667
-Well, I might have, um...
-(engine revving)

14:18.750 --> 14:20.959
Taken your Slayer out
and dented it, really damaged it,

14:21.041 --> 14:23.417
-but, hopefully not, so good luck!
-What?

14:24.667 --> 14:25.542
I told him.

14:25.625 --> 14:28.709
Besides, I mean, it's a tiny dent.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.750
Oh, whoa! Steady, girl, dude!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.709
Easy. (screaming)

14:40.125 --> 14:43.667
No more snacks,
they go "boom, boom." Ah!

14:43.750 --> 14:45.875
It's all good, I'm okay.

14:45.959 --> 14:47.792
Just get me a fresh ride, coach.

14:47.875 --> 14:51.458
-I can still win.
-Uh, Buttermaker, I'm over here.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.583
(groans)

14:52.667 --> 14:54.875
Clearly your eggs have
had a sound scrambling.

14:54.959 --> 14:57.250
I'm dry docking you
until further notice.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.333
No!

14:59.417 --> 15:02.709
While losing our best rider,
moments before our biggest race

15:02.792 --> 15:05.250
is a bit of a Gulliver, fear not.

15:05.333 --> 15:09.834
-I have a plan B.
-Yes, plan B?

15:09.917 --> 15:12.625
-We forfeit!
-Oh, that's wonk.

15:12.709 --> 15:14.917
-Baby, that's wonk.
-What have I done, Howard?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.375
Wrecked the Wave Slayer, ended
the team's chances of winning,

15:17.458 --> 15:19.041
and Luigi's snack stand,
and... hmm...

15:19.125 --> 15:23.000
-That was rhetorical, wasn't it?
-Hmm? Hmm...

15:23.083 --> 15:25.417
NinjaNomicon, you've gotta help me.

15:26.083 --> 15:29.834
(gurgling)

15:29.917 --> 15:31.041
Octo-world.

15:32.250 --> 15:35.458
"When a ninja does wrong,
he must own up to his mistakes."

15:35.542 --> 15:38.875
Wow, that is way too Nomicon-y
for this freshman to figure out.

15:38.959 --> 15:40.375
(scoffs)

15:43.208 --> 15:45.041
Still not following, but, don't worry,

15:45.125 --> 15:48.333
I mean, I'll come up
with something. (screams)

15:48.417 --> 15:50.208
(grunts) Coach, wait.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.375
-You can't forfeit!
-Of course I can.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.417
I simply inform the opposing
coach that his team wins.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.166
No, no, no, no. I mean, waxers are
technically part of the team,

15:58.250 --> 16:02.125
so why can't a waxer
ride in Buttermaker's place?

16:02.208 --> 16:07.417
Mr. Cunningham, you are absolutely right.
Today, a waxer shall ride.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.250
And, by the rules of the sea,
set forth by Poseidon himself,

16:11.333 --> 16:16.083
substitutes are chosen
in reverse alphabetical order.

16:16.166 --> 16:20.417
Weinerman! Prepare to taste
the face of King Neptune.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.417
(grunts) Stupid rules of the sea.

16:22.500 --> 16:26.000
Listen, Coach Green,
I'm more of a landlubber.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.458
And a meat lover, and a cheese lover.

16:28.542 --> 16:31.959
Perhaps my good friend, Cunningham,
could lick Neptune's face for you?

16:32.041 --> 16:36.917
Senor Weinerman, you no ride,
you no get the snack bar privileges.

16:37.750 --> 16:40.959
-(grunts)
-Wax boy, tend to my Slayer.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.417
(grumbles) Wax boy... Slayer...

16:43.500 --> 16:47.333
(moans) Can't believe I blew it.

16:47.417 --> 16:50.000
Gotta win the race.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.041
(alarm ringing)

17:00.959 --> 17:04.333
What rouses me
from my afternoon slumber?

17:04.417 --> 17:08.375
Dejection? Or maybe it's disappointment.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.375
Disheartenment, doldrums.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.625
-(squeaks)
-You're right.

17:13.709 --> 17:17.542
They're all equally
wonderful states of misery.

17:23.166 --> 17:28.125
Ah! Destroy... Flackville. (grunting)

17:28.208 --> 17:30.041
-(shouts indistinctly)
-Huh?

17:30.792 --> 17:32.917
-(screams)
-Dude.

17:33.792 --> 17:38.083
Nothing more refreshing
than a chaotic day at the lake.

17:38.166 --> 17:42.000
-(cackling)
-(up-tempo music plays)

17:42.083 --> 17:45.125
What up? It's your BF
on the beach, H-dub!

17:45.208 --> 17:47.417
Coming at you live from Lake Larusso.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.041
Here's a look at the line-up.

17:49.125 --> 17:52.667
Leading off on the tube run,
it's Hank Peterson!

17:52.750 --> 17:56.917
Putting his feet down in the
buoys, it's Speedboat Sam Healy!

17:57.000 --> 18:01.333
Followed by Doug the Tub
Jiminsky on the raging ramp.

18:01.417 --> 18:05.375
And anchoring the final sprint
is our own... Howard Weinerman?

18:05.458 --> 18:07.583
Are we trying to lose this thing?

18:08.333 --> 18:11.417
Done waxing your Slayer,
Mr. Weinerman.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.333
Hey, you didn't give it
the Buttermaker, did you?

18:13.417 --> 18:15.291
-I'll give you the Buttermaker.
-(whistle blows)

18:15.375 --> 18:17.750
-Huh?
-Slayers, to the starting line.

18:17.834 --> 18:22.458
Time to be a hero. (grunting)

18:22.542 --> 18:24.333
Ah!

18:25.083 --> 18:26.250
(audience cheering)

18:26.333 --> 18:27.667
(grunts, screams)

18:27.750 --> 18:28.959
(moans) Hmm...

18:30.834 --> 18:32.500
On your mark, get set, slay.

18:37.875 --> 18:41.542
-Destroy, dude!
-(screams)

18:41.625 --> 18:44.917
Buttermaker? Looks like
the ninja's getting wet.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.750
-Yah!
-Huh?

18:49.166 --> 18:51.000
-(indistinct growling)
-Huh?

18:51.083 --> 18:54.083
(panting) Ninja amphibious kick!

18:54.166 --> 18:55.166
-Yah!
-Thanks, Ninja!

18:55.250 --> 18:56.792
(grunts)

18:58.625 --> 19:00.667
(screaming)

19:03.834 --> 19:07.083
(grunting)

19:07.834 --> 19:08.750
What's up?

19:09.542 --> 19:11.125
Is this intimidating you?

19:11.959 --> 19:14.166
'Cause I totally know
what I'm doing here.

19:16.458 --> 19:17.875
(growling)

19:19.542 --> 19:20.834
Ninja double hook!

19:24.458 --> 19:25.291
Ah!

19:25.375 --> 19:29.375
Dude!
Ninja expanding baton. (shouts)

19:29.458 --> 19:33.917
(grunting)
Ninja double expanding baton!

19:36.875 --> 19:39.750
Hmm. That's cool.
You get a head start.

19:39.834 --> 19:42.500
I like to keep things
interesting anyway.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.667
-Underwater ninja punch!
-(growling)

19:45.583 --> 19:48.041
Don't worry, Jiminsky,
I'll win this one for the team!

19:48.125 --> 19:49.834
(screaming)

19:51.166 --> 19:54.250
Dude, your nose is all stanky.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.667
-(growls)
-Ninja nose bow.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.542

-(grunts)

20:08.291 --> 20:11.583
-Buttermaker, you okay?
-Ninj, how's the race going?

20:11.667 --> 20:14.583
|-Are we winning?
-What? You were a honking monster!

20:14.667 --> 20:16.041
Why do you care about the race?

20:16.125 --> 20:17.542
-I let my dudes down.
-(shouting)

20:17.625 --> 20:20.458
Never should've
crashed and gotten hurt.

20:20.542 --> 20:22.417
-It's all my fault!
-(gasps)

20:22.500 --> 20:26.208
<i>When a ninja does wrong,</i>
<i>he must own up to his mistakes.</i>

20:26.291 --> 20:28.125
What if it wasn't all your fault?

20:28.208 --> 20:30.959
-What if it was none your fault?
-What?

20:31.041 --> 20:33.208
What if, and this is just
a ninja theory here, okay?

20:33.291 --> 20:35.917
But what if one of the waxers
took your Slayer on a joyride

20:36.000 --> 20:37.750
and accidentally damaged it.

20:37.834 --> 20:41.625
Dude, I'd slay that little waxer
where the zinc don't go.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.375
Okay, all right.
Now, that makes sense.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.834
But what if he was really, really sorry?

20:45.917 --> 20:47.625
Guess I'd just flick him in the ear...

20:47.709 --> 20:48.750
-Deal.
-Huh?

20:48.834 --> 20:50.041
Let's get you back in that race!

20:50.125 --> 20:51.375
Ninja scarf grapple!

20:51.458 --> 20:53.417
-Dude!
-(screams)

20:53.500 --> 20:57.417
-Hang on, Howard!
-Back in the race, dudes!

20:57.500 --> 20:59.750
I was like this close to winning.

20:59.834 --> 21:01.250
No, you weren't.

21:01.333 --> 21:04.166
-Well, now we'll never know, will we?
-No, we'll know. We'll totally know.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.500
(grunts)

21:10.917 --> 21:12.709
Norrisville wins it by a nose!

21:12.792 --> 21:15.959
And my brother,
Howard "fart power" Weinerman,

21:16.041 --> 21:18.750
had nothing to do with it.
Big shocker there.

21:18.834 --> 21:19.959
(all cheering)

21:20.041 --> 21:22.083
- <i>We did it!</i>
- <i>Whoo!</i>

21:24.208 --> 21:26.959
So, how'd Buttermaker
take it when you fessed up?

21:27.041 --> 21:28.291
It's all good.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.041
(throbbing)

21:30.125 --> 21:31.625
Actually kind of stings,

21:31.709 --> 21:33.959
but on a deeper, more emotional level,
I feel a sense of...

21:34.041 --> 21:36.250
You know what would
make that sentence more interesting?

21:36.333 --> 21:38.083
Some buffalo knuckles. You in?

21:38.166 --> 21:39.583
-Hey... you go ahead.
