00:09.551 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:14.014


00:14.097 --> 00:15.265


00:21.980 --> 00:25.984


00:30.363 --> 00:32.240


00:32.323 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:37.454


00:38.371 --> 00:40.957


00:42.042 --> 00:45.420


00:48.590 --> 00:50.300
Ay!

00:51.843 --> 00:52.677
Ow!

00:52.761 --> 00:54.763


00:54.846 --> 00:57.098


00:57.182 --> 01:00.685
I think a swan dive will
start my day nicely.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.187
I'm doing a can opener.

01:03.938 --> 01:07.275
Followed by a reverse twisting ant eater
dumpster diving with a side of cheese.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.610


01:08.693 --> 01:10.820
Slays them every time.
How about you, Bomb?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.280
Cannonball.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.407
Same as always, Chuck.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.535
What's up with your voice?
You sound all weird.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.661
Got a sore throat.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.164
No problem. We can communicate
via hamboning.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.416


01:26.836 --> 01:29.255
Ugh! Do you hear that, Harold?

01:29.339 --> 01:32.675
The joyful noises of happy campers?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.427
-Whoa!
-Yes, it's unbearable.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.056
Attention all campers,

01:38.139 --> 01:43.728
<i>due to a noise induced stress headache,</i>
<i>the slide is now closed indefinitely.</i>

01:43.812 --> 01:47.065
Huh?

01:47.148 --> 01:48.650
What? Closed?

01:48.733 --> 01:51.861
Everyone's fun is over
because Lynette has a headache?

01:51.945 --> 01:56.574
"My name is Lynette and all this noise
is giving me a headache."

01:58.118 --> 02:02.622
"My name is Lynette,
and I'm a terribly bossy person."

02:03.289 --> 02:07.544
"My name's Lynette,
and I ruin everybody's fun."

02:07.627 --> 02:11.881
Bro, you sounded just like her.
Do it again.

02:11.965 --> 02:16.052
"My name's Lynette,
and I ruin everybody's fun."

02:16.136 --> 02:17.554
Hmm.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.888
-Come here.
-Oh!

02:18.972 --> 02:23.017
This way, dear. Some fresh air will
do you wonders. Yeah.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.104
Ugh! Quit talking so loudly.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.148
Can't you see I'm suffering here?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.568
Let's go.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.446
Tell everyone that the slide is back open.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.949
Why would anybody listen to me?

02:38.032 --> 02:41.077
-Do it as Lynette.
-Oh

02:43.246 --> 02:47.041
<i>Hello. Um, Lynette here.</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:49.460
<i>The slide is now reopened.</i>

02:53.339 --> 02:57.385
<i>Uh, also, Chuck and Stella</i>
<i>report to my office immediately.</i>

02:57.468 --> 02:58.303


02:58.386 --> 03:02.056
Lynette, I had no idea toilets overflow
if you stuff pineapples in them.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.976
-It was an honest mistake!
-Surprise!

03:06.352 --> 03:08.980
What are you guys doing here--
Wait, that was you?

03:09.063 --> 03:10.857
It was Bomb. Do another one.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.527
Hello, campers. It's Lynette again.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.406
Uh, everyone, uh, make
fart noises with your armpits.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.620
They're doing it.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.167
Uh, that was not an armpit.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.127
You know what this means, don't you?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.671
-We can announce whatever we want.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.591
We can turn Camp Splinterwood
into-- Into--

03:36.674 --> 03:38.384
Camp Red-tastic.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.929
I was thinking more like
Camp Stella Rules, but we could--

03:41.012 --> 03:44.933
I'm telling you, Harold.
I just heard myself over the PA.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.601
Wait, wait, wait.
Shh! They're back.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.562
Oh, we gotta get out of here.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.234
No, if we can get Lynette out of the way,

03:54.317 --> 03:58.529
we can use your freakish voice talents
to make this place a campers' paradise.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.073
Wait, I got an idea.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.746
Namaste.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.415
Fancy Feather Spa at your service.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.710
Harold, did you finally
do something useful?

04:13.211 --> 04:14.712
Go with it.

04:14.796 --> 04:19.008
Of course I did, there, sweet cakes.
Yeah.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.600
huh. This spa looks
a lot like our tool shed.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.687
Or maybe your tool shed
looks a lot like my spa.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.734
Now, why don't we lie back,
close our eyes,

04:36.818 --> 04:39.696
and let all that naughty stress melt away

04:39.779 --> 04:42.824
with the soothing songs
of the noble whale.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.080
Let's begin. Shall we?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.625
Wow. Someone's a little tense.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.669
Hmm.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.216
Looks like we have to kick it up a notch.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.763
Okay. What should we say first?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.974
Maybe we shouldn't abuse this power

05:08.057 --> 05:11.644
because it'll probably backfire
in some catastrophic way.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.689
Or we can use it for some serious fun.

05:16.357 --> 05:20.987
<i>Attention campers, ice cream will now be</i>
<i>served</i> <i>for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</i>

05:23.114 --> 05:27.535
Not bad. Okay, okay, my turn.
Okay, so first thing--

05:27.618 --> 05:32.123
<i>There's no limit to the number of birds</i>
<i>allowed on the catapult.</i>

05:44.469 --> 05:47.013
<i>-Harold, give yourself a raise.</i>

05:47.096 --> 05:49.057
<i>Love you, honey bumpkins.</i>

05:49.140 --> 05:51.059
<i>And cabin tipping is now permitted.</i>

05:51.142 --> 05:52.977
Huh? Whoa!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.153
Now let's take things up a notch and--

06:02.236 --> 06:04.155
Add sprinkles to that ice cream.

06:04.238 --> 06:07.950
Sprinkles? What are you talking about?
We need to spice things up.

06:08.951 --> 06:12.789
<i>Attention campers, all ice cream</i>
<i>will now be topped with hot sauce.</i>

06:24.175 --> 06:28.179
Oh, yeah, real fun. What are you, crazy?

06:28.262 --> 06:31.599
No, that's my idea of fun.
You got a problem with that?

06:31.682 --> 06:35.228
Just that it's nowhere near as fun
as a midair pillow fight at the dojo.

06:35.311 --> 06:38.356
Yeah. I think you mean
midair paintball fight.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.108
-Pillow fight.
-Paintball fight.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.318
<i>Pillow fight. Paintball fight.</i>

06:44.570 --> 06:49.075
<i>Pillow fight!</i>
<i>Paintball fight!</i>

06:49.158 --> 06:52.537
Did you hear that?
Perhaps I should have a look.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.206
What? No, you can't leave now.

06:55.289 --> 06:59.669
I haven't given you yourâ€¦
rake-y treatment yet.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.760
You want this camp to be fun?
Give me that.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.304
Uh, if anyone knows fun
around here, it's me.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.722
I know what fun is.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.187
Oh, guys, please don't fight.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.066
I'm trying to make Camp Stella Rules
a birdtopia.

07:22.150 --> 07:27.280
No. I'm making it a birdtopia.
You're ruining it.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.702
Whoa, Red!
I've seen you get angry before,

07:32.785 --> 07:35.621
but I've never seen you get angry
at a friend.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.751
What are we doing? This isn't us.
It's the PA.

07:40.835 --> 07:45.423
It's too powerful. It's twisted us.
Turning us into-- into Lynette.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.802
We can handle it. With the PA,
there's nothing we can't do.

07:49.886 --> 07:54.348
No, no more announcements.
We have to give the power back to Lynette.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.976
She's the only one evil enough
to handle it.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.394
Where are you going?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.522
To tell Lynette what we did
so she can take back the mic.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.442
Are you nuts? You can't tell Lynette.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.152
This is for our own good.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.573
Red!

08:10.656 --> 08:14.076
Oh, that's it. We're gonna get
thrown out of camp.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.663
Not if the PA can save us first.
Come on, Bomb.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.919
<i>Attention campers,</i>
<i>Red must be stopped at all costs,</i>

08:23.002 --> 08:26.380
<i>but gently-- maybe give him a hug?</i>

08:26.464 --> 08:28.674
-There he is! Get him.
-Aah!

08:47.235 --> 08:49.612
-Melons away.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.911


08:58.287 --> 08:59.539
Unh!

08:59.622 --> 09:01.249
-There he is.
Right there.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.959
<i>You have to stop him.</i>

09:04.752 --> 09:06.420
He's right there! Get him!

09:17.974 --> 09:19.934
Lynette, we did a terrible thing.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.186
Bomb has a sore throat.
He sounded exactly like you,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.313
so we used the PA to change the rules.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.066
This spa was a ruse
to get you out of the way.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.193
This isn't a masseuse. It's Chuck.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.530
How dare you? I am a real masseuse,
and I--

09:32.613 --> 09:34.156
Oh, no. Wait.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.533
I know it was wrong.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.827
We thought we could make a birdtopia,

09:37.910 --> 09:40.538
but all we did
was tear our friendship apart.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.916
Help us, Lynette.
We throw ourselves on your mercy.

09:50.214 --> 09:54.385
I haven't felt this relaxed in years.

09:54.468 --> 09:57.597
My headache is completely gone.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.184
It was all just youthful exuberance,
I'm sure.

10:02.893 --> 10:06.606
-She wasn't mad at all.
-Nice work, Chuck. You saved our eggs.

10:11.569 --> 10:16.073
Sorry I got so angry with you, Stella.
I feel there might be a lesson here?

10:16.157 --> 10:20.786
Next time, I'm making sure you and Lynette
are both out of the picture.

10:22.830 --> 10:28.794
And I'm never going to imitate anyone
ever, ever, ever again. Like ever.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.132
You know, Stella, hot sauce on ice cream?
Not bad.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.053
-What?
-Uh, what?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.387
Aw, nothing.
