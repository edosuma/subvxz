WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:04.305
RRATOR: Tonight
on The Curse of Oak Island...

00:04.338 --> 00:06.040
We're on an obstruction.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.112
RICK:
Houston, we have a problem.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.713
-GARY: Ooh!

00:16.650 --> 00:18.186
Yeah.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.802
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.835 --> 00:38.239
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.272 --> 00:41.442
for more than 200 years.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.578
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.612 --> 00:47.448
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.481 --> 00:50.618
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.651 --> 00:54.088
and a lead cross, whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.122 --> 00:57.225
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:57.258 --> 01:02.363
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.396 --> 01:07.501
And, according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:07.535 --> 01:11.139
before the treasure
can be found.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.150
*

01:26.454 --> 01:29.890
NARRATOR: It is the start
of another day on Oak Island.

01:29.923 --> 01:34.762
One filled with a mix of both
eagerness and anticipation

01:34.795 --> 01:38.566
as the team continues
with their massive excavation

01:38.599 --> 01:42.270
of the shaft known as D.M.T.
in the Money Pit area.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.676
Vanessa, how far is the casing
down already?

01:48.709 --> 01:51.445
32 feet.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.215
So, just over
one section, right?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.350
Yeah. Yep, yep.

01:56.384 --> 01:59.520
NARRATOR: Named in honor
of Craig Tester's son, Drake,

01:59.553 --> 02:02.790
who tragically passed away
earlier this year,

02:02.823 --> 02:07.161
D.M.T.'s location was chosen
after careful research.

02:07.195 --> 02:10.831
It is hoped that by placing
the drill site approximately

02:10.864 --> 02:15.503
ten feet south of the recently
excavated shaft named H-8,

02:15.536 --> 02:18.639
the team might be able to find
the elusive object

02:18.672 --> 02:23.177
that slipped away from the H-8
drilling caisson two weeks ago.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.419
VANESSA: Man, it's sure
satisfying seeing full buckets,

02:31.452 --> 02:33.787
-CHARLES: Yeah.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.656
That is some thick old stuff
there, isn't it?

02:35.689 --> 02:38.426
MIKE J.:
Oh, yeah.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.927
And there's no wood at all?
At anything, right?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.629
-Yeah. -Well, that little bit
there, right?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.264
MIKE J.: That piece
that's laying up against there,

02:43.297 --> 02:44.532
and there's some
in the other bucket.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.634
CHARLES:
Yeah, we think we just caught,

02:46.667 --> 02:49.437
maybe just that south edge
of the-- of the Chappell Shaft.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.373
NARRATOR: The fact that the team
is not encountering wood

02:52.406 --> 02:55.476
or other evidence
of previous searcher activity

02:55.509 --> 02:57.345
is a promising sign.

02:57.378 --> 03:01.249
It indicates that the D.M.T.
shaft is drilling through

03:01.282 --> 03:04.485
unexplored ground, and that
they may be able to excavate

03:04.518 --> 03:07.521
down to their target depth
much quicker than expected.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.290
MIKE J.: Good bucketfuls
out of her, anyway.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.226
VANESSA: It is, yeah.
He's excavating out really fast.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.596
NARRATOR: While the team
from Irving Equipment, Limited

03:15.629 --> 03:20.434
continues to drill down
into the D.M.T. shaft...

03:20.468 --> 03:22.703
Rick Lagina meets
in the war room

03:22.736 --> 03:24.938
with metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

03:24.972 --> 03:27.308
and researcher Doug Crowell.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.378
Doug, look...
As always, thanks for coming.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.281
I think we're all still sky high
about Gary's find.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.316
I mean, I-I know I am.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.685
NARRATOR: They are hoping
to obtain new information

03:37.718 --> 03:40.588
on what could be the most
significant discovery

03:40.621 --> 03:42.990
ever made on Oak Island--

03:43.023 --> 03:48.462
a lead cross found at
Smith's Cove three weeks ago.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.899
RICK: What really captivates
people about Oak Island

03:51.932 --> 03:53.667
is the "what ifs."

03:53.701 --> 03:57.771
You know? What could this
mystery be all about?

03:57.805 --> 04:03.577
If we can directly connect
this object with Templars...

04:03.611 --> 04:05.679
yes, that's huge.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.615
When it first came out
of the ground, I pressed you

04:07.648 --> 04:08.949
for a window on time.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.453
I-I-I was amazed.
1200 to 1600?

04:12.486 --> 04:15.789
I mean, it's remarkable,

04:15.823 --> 04:18.892
but it all rounds back to your
find-- you're still ecstatic.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.795
I'm gob-smacked!
It's unbelievable.

04:21.829 --> 04:25.466
I mean, I can't believe you guys
are talking about Templars.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.500
Wow.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.004
There is a direct tie to...

04:31.038 --> 04:34.575
from the depiction in the
Templar prison in Domme

04:34.608 --> 04:37.811
to that figurine right there
that you hold in your hand.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.614
It'll be interesting to see
what Zena thinks of it.

04:40.648 --> 04:41.982
Yeah.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.851
-Okay.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.919
NARRATOR:
To help identify

04:45.953 --> 04:48.656
and possibly date
the lead cross,

04:48.689 --> 04:51.091
Rick has decided to reach out
to his friend,

04:51.124 --> 04:54.595
New York-based historian
and author, Zena Halpern.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.478
NARRATOR: It was Zena's earlier
research concerning

05:10.511 --> 05:13.547
a number of mysterious maps
that compelled Rick,

05:13.581 --> 05:15.583
along with two of his nephews,

05:15.616 --> 05:18.652
to journey to France
one month ago.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.554
-And it was there...
-Wow.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.990
...while visiting
a former Templar prison,

05:23.023 --> 05:25.793
that Rick spotted a carving
of a crucifix

05:25.826 --> 05:29.797
that bears an eerie similarity
to the lead cross.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.468
Hi, Zena. This is Rick.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.606
Nice to hear from you.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.907
Doug is in the room,

05:39.940 --> 05:42.109
and also, uh, Gary Drayton.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.414
And I believe that we've
sent you a picture

05:46.447 --> 05:48.882
of the latest find--
do you have that?

05:52.586 --> 05:54.121
And... what do you think?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.741
Is there a time period for her?

06:57.951 --> 07:02.590
NARRATOR: The cross,
not a Christian symbol,

07:02.623 --> 07:05.158
but one representing
a 3,000-year-old

07:05.192 --> 07:07.761
Phoenician goddess?

07:07.795 --> 07:10.163
Worshipped by ancient
civilizations,

07:10.197 --> 07:13.100
from North Africa to Europe
to the Middle East

07:13.133 --> 07:15.102
and even to parts of Asia,

07:15.135 --> 07:18.672
Tanit was a Punic
and Phoenician deity

07:18.706 --> 07:21.842
who was revered
as the goddess of the moon.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.578
She was also known
as the goddess of fertility,

07:24.612 --> 07:26.780
love, motherhood,

07:26.814 --> 07:30.117
and the protector of sailors
on the high seas.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.887
Although her likeness has been
depicted in many forms,

07:33.921 --> 07:37.958
her most common representation
consists of a circular head

07:37.991 --> 07:43.664
with outstretched arms
and a triangular body.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.034
Is there any record
of the Templars, uh,

07:47.067 --> 07:50.704
having some belief
in-in the goddess figure,

07:50.738 --> 07:51.972
or the goddess...

08:04.284 --> 08:07.988
Gary Drayton and Doug Crowell
have just been told
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

08:08.021 --> 08:10.190
by historian and author
Zena Halpern

08:10.223 --> 08:13.026
that the mysterious lead cross
they recently found

08:13.060 --> 08:15.963
on Oak Island depicts
the goddess Tanit.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.531
DOUG:
Zena?

08:17.565 --> 08:19.132
Zena, this is Doug.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.135
What would you think if,
uh, we told you that,

08:22.169 --> 08:24.705
on the trip to France
that Rick made,

08:24.738 --> 08:28.642
he saw the same carving
in a Templar prison?

09:02.976 --> 09:06.213
NARRATOR: Could the cross-shaped
carving Rick Lagina was shown

09:06.246 --> 09:10.250
in the 14th century Templar
prison in Domme, France,

09:10.283 --> 09:14.622
actually be a depiction
of the goddess Tanit?

09:14.655 --> 09:20.027
In 1307, the order of the
Knights Templar was disbanded

09:20.060 --> 09:23.263
by Pope Clement V
and were charged with heresy

09:23.296 --> 09:27.735
by his close ally,
King Philip IV of France.

09:27.768 --> 09:32.072
Many believe that the Templars
were innocent of the charges,

09:32.105 --> 09:34.942
but their accusers were
desperate to take possession

09:34.975 --> 09:37.778
of the precious religious
treasure they had accumulated

09:37.811 --> 09:39.713
during the Crusades,

09:39.747 --> 09:43.684
including the Ark of the
Covenant and the Holy Grail.

09:43.717 --> 09:47.955
Thousands of Templars were
rounded up, imprisoned

09:47.988 --> 09:50.290
and eventually executed.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.729
But could the cross-shaped
carving Rick Lagina was shown

09:55.763 --> 09:59.066
in the 14th century Templar
prison in Domme, France

09:59.099 --> 10:01.134
actually be a depiction

10:01.168 --> 10:05.639
not only of Jesus Christ
but also of the Goddess Tanit?

10:05.673 --> 10:09.109
Was there a period in history
when both were thought to be

10:09.142 --> 10:13.146
symbols of protection
as well as resurrection?

10:13.180 --> 10:17.217
Where does the reverence
for the goddess, uh, come from?

10:17.250 --> 10:20.353
Is it associated with
a

10:35.068 --> 10:37.404
Would that include Jerusalem
as well?

10:39.406 --> 10:41.174
RICK: I'm not surprised
by what she thought of it;

10:41.208 --> 10:42.843
I'm shocked.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.178
It's a very different take.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.781
I think both Gary and I thought
it was a depiction

10:47.815 --> 10:49.917
of a Christian cross.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.785
DOUG:
Do you think, uh,

10:51.819 --> 10:54.287
Templars, when they were
on their Crusades,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.123
do you think this is something
they would have, uh,

10:56.156 --> 10:58.325
encountered in the Holy Land?

11:01.228 --> 11:03.964
NARRATOR: During the Crusades
in the 12th century,

11:03.997 --> 11:06.133
the Knights Templar
were headquartered

11:06.166 --> 11:08.869
in the Middle Eastern city
of Jerusalem.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.204
There, they came to adopt
the symbols

11:11.238 --> 11:13.006
of other religious faiths,

11:13.040 --> 11:15.375
including the Jerusalem cross

11:15.408 --> 11:18.278
and the Hebraic Tree of Life.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.815
But could they have also come
to revere the goddess Tanit?

11:23.884 --> 11:26.987
But have you seen a
three-dimensional representation

11:27.020 --> 11:29.356
of the goddess,
because initially,

11:29.389 --> 11:32.359
when we pulled it
out of the-the earth,

11:32.392 --> 11:35.262
I immediately thought
it was a representation

11:35.295 --> 11:37.030
of Christ crucified,

11:37.064 --> 11:39.266
but then we noticed
that the arms,

11:39.299 --> 11:44.004
the outstretched arms are...
rounded, if you will,

11:44.037 --> 11:48.275
as though this... the statue
is reaching out to embrace.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.055
NARRATOR: Although
commonly representative

12:02.089 --> 12:04.057
of Christianity for centuries,

12:04.091 --> 12:07.260
the cross did not become
a familiar symbol

12:07.294 --> 12:11.765
until nearly 300 years
after the crucifixion of Jesus.

12:11.799 --> 12:15.302
The Egyptian cross,
also known as the Ankh,

12:15.335 --> 12:20.007
signified immortality and was
widely associated with Isis,

12:20.040 --> 12:23.543
the goddess of life,
going back thousands of years.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.980
In Greek history,
the cross was said to represent

12:27.014 --> 12:31.284
the four elements of water,
wind, fire and earth.

12:31.318 --> 12:34.888
Could it be possible that the
cross that Rick and the team

12:34.922 --> 12:36.957
believe to be
an ancient crucifix

12:36.990 --> 12:40.760
is actually
an even older artifact?

12:50.603 --> 12:53.807
Okay. Rick-Rick wants me
to tell you about the find

12:53.841 --> 12:56.076
that was made
in the Money Pit area.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.179
One of the holes brought up
a couple pieces of human bone.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.084
DOUG: The origin of the person
that piece of bone belonged to

13:04.117 --> 13:05.518
was the Middle East.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.005
RICK: I do know this--
that she's excited

13:25.038 --> 13:28.175
and Gary is over-the-top happy.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.510
Is it an incredibly interesting
find on Oak Island?

13:30.543 --> 13:32.245
You bet it is,

13:32.279 --> 13:35.849
but we need experts
to give us an opinion.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.885
Zena, you take care.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.288
You-you take care, Zena.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.256
Thank you, Zena. Bye.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.593
Bye-bye. Bye.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.261
Wow.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.630
I thought, at least initially,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.933
this was a depiction
of Christ crucified,

13:52.966 --> 13:57.037
which she is adamant
that it is not, and-and, uh...

13:57.070 --> 14:00.307
So we need to do
some-some further research.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.342
I'm not saying
that I don't believe her,

14:02.375 --> 14:07.547
but there's always a benefit
to corroborative evidence.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.418
NARRATOR: As the team continues
to investigate various theories

14:11.451 --> 14:14.621
about the mysterious cross
and its possible origins,

14:14.654 --> 14:16.656
they will also need
to subject it

14:16.689 --> 14:19.026
to a number
of scientific tests.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.895
If it can be determined
that the object

14:21.929 --> 14:24.464
really does date back
to the 14th century--

14:24.497 --> 14:26.967
or even earlier--

14:27.000 --> 14:28.535
they may have come close
to proving

14:28.568 --> 14:30.370
that members
of the Knights Templar

14:30.403 --> 14:32.339
really did come to Oak Island

14:32.372 --> 14:35.108
and that the Money Pit
might be much older

14:35.142 --> 14:37.010
than previously thought.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.445
Amazing find.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.313
I don't know what else
to say other than,

14:40.347 --> 14:41.514
"Let's go back out
and find some more."

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
-Yeah.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.361
NARRATOR:
Later that day,

14:54.394 --> 14:57.564
Rick Lagina
and Charles Barkhouse

14:57.597 --> 15:00.367
head to the northernmost area
of the Oak Island swamp

15:00.400 --> 15:03.236
on property owned by the family
of Fred Nolan,

15:03.270 --> 15:09.142
the legendary treasure hunter
who passed away in 2016.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.244
Yeah, intake's
on this side, Rick.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.246
Okay.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.215
NARRATOR:
One week ago,

15:15.248 --> 15:17.550
Rick and Charles
met with Fred's son Tom,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.419
who shared with them

15:19.452 --> 15:23.056
his father's invaluable
survey maps of the island

15:23.090 --> 15:26.126
and granted them
unprecedented access

15:26.159 --> 15:29.596
to explore the 16 acres
of Nolan's property--

15:29.629 --> 15:32.099
a large area
that was off-limits

15:32.132 --> 15:35.202
to the team's search efforts...
until now.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.369
Let's put this together.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.470
-Absolutely.
-Let's put it to bed.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.439
No, let's do it.

15:39.472 --> 15:43.210
NARRATOR: One location
long believed by Fred Nolan

15:43.243 --> 15:46.213
to hold the key to solving
the Oak Island mystery

15:46.246 --> 15:48.615
is the northern point, or apex,

15:48.648 --> 15:51.985
of the mysterious
triangle-shaped swamp.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.621
Not only has the swamp
been theorized

15:54.654 --> 15:56.523
to be a man-made body of water,

15:56.556 --> 15:59.692
but its shape has been thought
to be a deliberate symbol

15:59.726 --> 16:02.695
of the Freemasons,
a secretive fraternity

16:02.729 --> 16:04.731
that evolved
from the Knights Templar

16:04.764 --> 16:07.267
and have been connected
to the Oak Island mystery

16:07.300 --> 16:09.469
for more than two centuries.

16:09.502 --> 16:13.206
It is also here
at the apex of the swamp--

16:13.240 --> 16:16.776
a location corresponding with
the Masonic all-seeing eye--

16:16.809 --> 16:19.446
that Fred Nolan believed
important clues,

16:19.479 --> 16:23.216
perhaps even a secret tunnel
entrance to the Money Pit,

16:23.250 --> 16:24.451
might be found.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.556
RICK: Fred related that he had
found some interesting things

16:29.589 --> 16:33.493
in the swamp, and I'm hoping
that, that with the maps, uh,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.728
with Tom's understanding
of some of the w-work

16:35.762 --> 16:37.064
that his father did,
and in fact,

16:37.097 --> 16:38.298
Tom did some of the work.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.267
So I'm hoping that,

16:40.300 --> 16:42.035
again, working together,

16:42.069 --> 16:43.803
we-we can get some answers.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.239
NARRATOR:
Now, after obtaining permission

16:46.273 --> 16:48.508
from both Tom
and the Canadian government,

16:48.541 --> 16:51.411
Rick, Marty
and the Oak Island team

16:51.444 --> 16:53.480
are draining this section
of the swamp

16:53.513 --> 16:56.483
to see just what could be
hidden here.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.784
Whoa.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.253
I didn't think it was that deep.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.721
Can you give me some more hose?

17:01.754 --> 17:05.092
Yep.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.532
I think it's gonna draw off
the water pretty quick.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.833
Yeah.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.469
CHARLES:
There it goes.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.341
This isn't gonna take very long,
I don't think.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.146
NARRATOR: While the northern
section of the swamp drains

17:26.179 --> 17:28.548
enough to allow
for exploration,

17:28.581 --> 17:32.119
and while the team from Irving
Equipment, Limited continues

17:32.152 --> 17:34.587
excavating the D.M.T. shaft,

17:34.621 --> 17:37.690
Charles Barkhouse joins
Jack Begley

17:37.724 --> 17:40.427
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

17:40.460 --> 17:43.630
as they continue
searching an old dump site

17:43.663 --> 17:46.233
believed to be connected
to the construction

17:46.266 --> 17:49.369
of the original Money Pit.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.740
Last week, after studying Fred
Nolan's detailed survey maps

17:53.773 --> 17:58.211
of the island, Rick, Marty
and the team began excavating

17:58.245 --> 18:02.215
the dump and began finding
potentially important clues.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.516
CHARLES:
I got some pottery here.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.818
-Look.
: Oh, wow.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.487
That's a lot of pottery.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.760
-See how we're getting into
the sterile soil now? -Yeah.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.695
GARY:
This is great.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.265
This is enough room
for me to metal detect

18:18.298 --> 18:20.867
on the bottom and the sides.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.603
How far do you want him
to go, Gary?

18:23.636 --> 18:25.772
GARY: Just to where
the first trench ends.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.407
CHARLES:
Okay.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.309
Oh, I think
what I should do, Charles,

18:29.342 --> 18:32.345
is scan over this area,
and the spoil piles...

18:32.379 --> 18:35.114
-Okay. -Think I'm ready
to start detecting.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.826
Small, small iron.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.761
That'd be a little nail.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.166
-Ooh.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.802
First decent-sounding target
of the day.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.770
Here we go.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.347
CHARLES:
Come on, Gary. Pull out a coin.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.816
GARY:
Would be nice.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.551
Ooh!

19:11.584 --> 19:14.354
This is worth digging, guys.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.357
-GARY: That is a beauty.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.231
NARRATOR: On Lot 12,
near the middle of the island,

19:24.264 --> 19:26.799
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

19:26.833 --> 19:30.203
along with Charles Barkhouse
and Jack Begley,

19:30.237 --> 19:33.906
have just made
a potentially important find.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.576
GARY: That's, like,
a decorative hinge.

19:36.609 --> 19:40.680
I've found some beautiful ones
that were off chests on, uh,

19:40.713 --> 19:43.516
-Spanish shipwreck sites.
-Mm-hmm.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.718
So I would say this is very old.

19:45.752 --> 19:49.589
NARRATOR: A decorative hinge
from a chest?

19:49.622 --> 19:51.558
-PETER: Oh, look at this.
-Check this thing out.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.959
NARRATOR:
Could it be connected

19:52.992 --> 19:54.961
to one of
the three missing chests

19:54.994 --> 19:58.698
that once belonged to the
pirate Captain James Anderson?

19:58.731 --> 20:01.601
And if so,
could there be a connection

20:01.634 --> 20:05.305
to the skeleton key
found by Fred Nolan?

20:05.338 --> 20:07.407
CHARLES:
Back in the old days,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.008
you don't take your money
and put it in a bank.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.310
People kept it
on their property.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.644
They put it in a tin can.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.346
They put it in a chest
or somewhere,

20:13.380 --> 20:15.014
and they buried it
on their property.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.583
GARY:
Let's see if there's any more.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.386
It's amazing.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.421
I'm still hearing
little pieces of iron.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.390
-No.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.526
Chirpy little iron signal.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.760
JACK:
You don't want to go for it?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.729
No.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.433
CHARLES:
Here's something.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.969
What is that?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.938
GARY:
Wow.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.440
It's got a nail in it,
or something.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.608
-It's got a...

20:41.641 --> 20:42.709
By the look of it...

20:42.742 --> 20:44.277
That's a strap of some sort.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.812
-No, it's a hinge.
-That is a hinge.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.547
-That's another hinge.
-Oh. Whoa. Yeah.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.582
-That's exactly what that is.
-And it looks...

20:49.616 --> 20:51.918
-JACK: Wow. -Yup.
These are the type of hinges

20:51.951 --> 20:54.621
that come off chests or boxes.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.589
-Yeah.
-GARY: Look at that.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.024
-We saved the best till last.
-JACK: Yeah.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.392
NARRATOR:
Another hinge?

20:59.426 --> 21:02.529
Possibly belonging to a chest?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.731
Could these hinges be evidence

21:04.764 --> 21:06.966
that this centuries-old
dump site

21:06.999 --> 21:09.068
was used not only during
the construction

21:09.101 --> 21:12.639
of the original Money Pit,
but also as a place

21:12.672 --> 21:15.908
where treasure was deposited
long ago?

21:15.942 --> 21:20.547
If so, what else might
this so

21:20.580 --> 21:22.315
Here's some pottery.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.850
-Yeah.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.618
-Yeah.
-Tiny little pottery shard.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.786
-Oh, hey.
-Gentlemen. -Hey, guys

21:26.819 --> 21:28.488
-Yeah.
-Hey, guys.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.689
Hi.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.724
Well, has he danced yet?

21:31.758 --> 21:33.926
-Not yet.
-No, no dancing yet.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.862
I mean, we've really
hammered this area.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.764
-It sure looks like it.
-Yeah.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.968
And I'm pretty positive
this is the site of the dump.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.804
All right. Well, that's good.
Let's, uh-- you have

21:44.837 --> 21:46.739
-a whole bunch of stuff.
-GARY: Yeah. -CHARLES: Yeah.

21:46.773 --> 21:50.009
Here's a couple of nice finds
that came out at the end there.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.678
MARTY:
What are they?

21:51.711 --> 21:54.080
-GARY: Hinges.
-MARTY: Oh, yeah.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.983
GARY: And I've found decorative
hinges like this

21:57.016 --> 21:58.785
off boxes or chests.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.655
RICK: I mean, for me,
the Nolan property

22:02.689 --> 22:04.424
is a mystery within a mystery.

22:04.457 --> 22:08.060
I don't know
what Fred came to know.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.963
But there are answers there,
there's no question about that.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.866
Who knows what may be
excavated out of that?

22:13.900 --> 22:17.537
Who knows how many more items
of interest may surface?

22:17.570 --> 22:20.507
-MARTY: That could be
the missing chest. -GARY: Yeah.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.008
So this is a really good
first step,

22:22.041 --> 22:23.876
in terms of cooperating
with Tom.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.779
I think that, you know, we find
the limits of this dump...

22:26.813 --> 22:28.615
-Yeah.
-...and, you know,

22:28.648 --> 22:31.384
as we go forward with
cooperating with Tom, again,

22:31.418 --> 22:32.719
this is the first step.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.054
I-I think it's a positive
first step.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.489
It's a success.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.525
We were looking for an old dump

22:38.558 --> 22:39.859
and we found an old dump.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.629
-Yup. -MARTY: Good job,
guys, carry on.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.036
NARRATOR:
The next day, as the excavation

22:50.069 --> 22:53.540
of the D.M.T. shaft continues
at the Money Pit...

22:55.775 --> 22:59.412
...Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Marty's son Alex

22:59.446 --> 23:02.014
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

23:02.048 --> 23:04.717
are now ready
to begin investigating

23:04.751 --> 23:08.154
the apex of the swamp located
on Nolan's property.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.625
Hey, Rick!

23:12.659 --> 23:17.697
If you see these gloves
sticking up out of the swamp,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.165
I want you to come get me.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.602
Got it?

23:24.604 --> 23:26.205
MARTY: I do not want to go
back into the swamp.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.941
I will follow him
into the swamp, if I have to.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.843
He knows I don't like it.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.745
It stinks, and you never know

23:32.779 --> 23:35.081
where the bottom's gonna be
on your next step.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.583
-You know, I mean...
-That is true.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.617
Yeah.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.752
MARTY:
Oh, God.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.589
I'll go with Gary, you guys run,
start that other pump.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.090
-ALEX: All right.
-See what it looks like.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.863
NARRATOR: With the first
of the four small ponds

23:50.897 --> 23:53.099
on the Nolan property drained,

23:53.132 --> 23:57.504
Rick and Gary begin exploring
with a metal detector.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.576
Meanwhile, Marty and Alex
continue to drain

24:03.610 --> 24:06.813
another nearby area,
preparing large plywood boards

24:06.846 --> 24:09.448
to create a safe walkway
over the deep sludge.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.552
MARTY:
God, I hate this swamp.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.653
Going down.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.124
NARRATOR:
It is the team's hope

24:18.157 --> 24:20.092
that by searching
an area of the swamp

24:20.126 --> 24:22.629
that was previously
closed off to them,

24:22.662 --> 24:24.997
they may discover
compelling new evidence

24:25.031 --> 24:27.600
that the swamp is man-made,

24:27.634 --> 24:31.638
and that it was created to hide
either a sunken pirate ship

24:31.671 --> 24:35.575
or a secret entrance
into the Oak Island Money Pit.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.209
Digging on the Nolan side
of the swamp,

24:37.243 --> 24:39.746
it's important to me
for one reason.

24:39.779 --> 24:43.983
Fred believed that the swamp
was key to solving the mystery.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.653
Is there a treasure galleon
in the swamp?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.621
Or is there a vault?

24:48.655 --> 24:52.224
And my hope is that it's there
and that we can find it.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.962
Because, look,
it's part of Fred's legacy.

24:57.697 --> 25:00.299
See, this is the type of area

25:00.332 --> 25:04.036
where you've got that trough,
and there's a runoff.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.006
Could expose something.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.750
You okay?

25:17.784 --> 25:19.285
Yeah, I just...

25:19.318 --> 25:22.655
I got something here,
I don't know what it is.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.824
You said it's a piece of wood?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.693
A piece of wood, yeah.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.696
Long, too.

25:31.664 --> 25:34.533
That is not
what we're looking for.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.005
-Baby.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.575
-Look at that.
-Yeah.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.210
Now, that's what
we're looking for.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.282
GARY:
Holy schmoly.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.118
Look at that.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.920
NARRATOR: At the northern point
of the swamp,

25:53.953 --> 25:57.289
on property belonging
to the family of Fred Nolan,

25:57.323 --> 26:01.961
Rick Lagina has just found
a large wooden stake.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.096
Does it look old to you?

26:04.130 --> 26:05.998
Tough to tell, isn't it?

26:06.032 --> 26:07.667
-It looks likes it's been
hacked. -It's hacked.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.901
It's ax-cut.
There's no question about that.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.037
Yeah, it's not sawed.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.672
NARRATOR:
A wooden stake?

26:12.705 --> 26:15.141
Found in the swamp?

26:15.174 --> 26:20.880
In 1969, Oak Island landowner
and treasure hunter Fred Nolan

26:20.913 --> 26:24.350
set out to drain the swamp
after becoming convinced

26:24.383 --> 26:26.719
that the answers
to the Oak Island mystery

26:26.753 --> 26:28.788
were located within it.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.759
During his investigation,
Fred was astonished to discover

26:32.792 --> 26:35.662
several uniform lines
of wooden stakes,

26:35.695 --> 26:39.131
which were carbon-dated
to the 1500s.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.233
A land surveyor by trade,

26:41.267 --> 26:43.402
it was Fred's
professional assessment

26:43.435 --> 26:46.906
that these stakes were evidence
of centuries-old survey markers

26:46.939 --> 26:49.041
used to plot out the boundaries

26:49.075 --> 26:51.377
in a massive
construction project.

26:51.410 --> 26:54.213
This led Fred
to the astonishing conclusion

26:54.246 --> 26:57.684
that Oak Island was once
actually two islands,

26:57.717 --> 26:59.385
artificially joined together

26:59.418 --> 27:03.022
by means
of the triangle-shaped swamp.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.157
How many cuts are there?

27:05.191 --> 27:08.895
Fred and Tom both told me there
were four or five on every one.

27:08.928 --> 27:12.231
-One, two... three...
-Three...

27:12.264 --> 27:13.800
four...

27:13.833 --> 27:15.702
-GARY: Yeah, five.
-RICK: That's...

27:15.735 --> 27:18.370
that's exactly
what they described.

27:18.404 --> 27:21.040
Fred actually did show me one.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.009
It's certainly got
the proper look to it.

27:23.042 --> 27:27.146
It's got the proper size,
diameter,

27:27.179 --> 27:29.816
and thus, one could speculate--

27:29.849 --> 27:34.020
again, it's speculation--
that the swamp had been created.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.956
If it were a fence post,
there'd be fasteners.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.758
Yeah, there is nothing.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.426
I mean, I went over that area
with the metal detector.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.895
-Oh, that's right.
-It didn't detect anything.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.864
-So there's no iron in it.
-That's definitely ax-cut,

27:44.897 --> 27:46.398
-Oh, yeah.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.800
Well...

27:47.834 --> 27:49.368
Dan and Fred,

27:49.401 --> 27:51.070
they pulled one up together.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.238
Cut the tip off,
and Triton Alliance

27:52.271 --> 27:54.306
sent it off to be carbon-dated.

27:54.340 --> 27:59.278
Carbon date came back 1575,
plus or minus 85 years.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.980
Finding a survey stake
is important

28:01.013 --> 28:02.815
because it's corroborative.

28:02.849 --> 28:05.051
Is this really
a man-made activity

28:05.084 --> 28:07.453
that is associated
with the swamp?

28:07.486 --> 28:09.188
You know, it's items like that

28:09.221 --> 28:10.723
that may provide answers.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.458
-Marty!
-MARTY: Yo!

28:12.491 --> 28:15.094
I think I found one
of the survey stakes.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.495
Why don't you come over
and take a look?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.264
Hey, that sounds great.
We're on it.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.966
-All right. -ALEX:
That's a pretty big deal, right?

28:19.999 --> 28:21.934
MARTY: Yeah. Well, that's
what he was looking for.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.069
All right, let's see it.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.303
ALEX:
What you got?

28:24.336 --> 28:26.005
Oh, yeah.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.841
Well, that's for real.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.377
Oop.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.745
That's not a natural shape.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.313
No.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.115
And remember how they said
it was preserved?

28:36.148 --> 28:40.019
-Yeah, from the bottom.
-From the bottom.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.988
ALEX: Well, it's definitely been
in place a while,

28:42.021 --> 28:44.223
'cause you can tell, if you look
at the preservation here,

28:44.256 --> 28:47.059
and how much
it's decayed up there,

28:47.093 --> 28:49.095
so you get a kind of
sense of time,

28:49.128 --> 28:51.297
-with the top being so much.
-Oh, yeah, this looks virgin.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.199
Right, but this looks old,

28:53.232 --> 28:55.467
-is what I'm saying.
-Very much so, I agree with you.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.170
It's pretty cool.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.440
Okay, so I don't get it.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.276
Why aren't you over the moon
about this survey stake?

29:04.310 --> 29:06.345
Why aren't you doing
a stake dance?

29:06.378 --> 29:08.781
Cause I don't do...
I don't do stake dances.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.818
I'm very interested in it.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.120
-To me, they look...
-Exactly right.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.187
Exactly right.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.056
It is what you were looking for.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.825
Yeah, I was impressed,
honestly,

29:18.858 --> 29:20.026
because to me
it looks identical

29:20.059 --> 29:21.393
to what he's described.

29:21.427 --> 29:25.932
And my skepticism level
diminishes.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.500
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty and the team,

29:28.534 --> 29:30.937
finding new evidence
that the mysterious

29:30.970 --> 29:33.405
triangle-shaped swamp
is man-made

29:33.439 --> 29:36.442
could soon lead
to another major breakthrough.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.979
It also means that the access
they now have

29:40.012 --> 29:43.015
to Fred Nolan's property
could allow them to gather

29:43.049 --> 29:46.352
a host of even more
important clues.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.320
*

29:51.290 --> 29:54.927
The next day,
back at the Money Pit...

29:54.961 --> 29:57.864
Hey, Dave, how deep are we?

29:57.897 --> 30:00.532
Caisson 75, and the plug is 60.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.935
JACK:
All right. Sounds good.

30:02.969 --> 30:06.338
...Rick Lagina joins members
of the Oak Island team

30:06.372 --> 30:09.876
where the excavation
of the D.M.T. shaft continues.

30:11.878 --> 30:15.614
So far, the caisson is
advancing faster than expected,

30:15.647 --> 30:19.085
having reached a depth
of some 75 feet.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.486
DANNY: This is gonna be
a beautiful day.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.254
I can feel it.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.023
-RICK: That's good.
-I can feel it. I know it.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.324
I hope you're right,
I hope you're right.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.492
DANNY:
Sweet.

30:26.525 --> 30:29.161
We're ready.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.263
We're ready
for when the gold comes over.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.499
We'll know soon.

30:38.905 --> 30:42.241
RICK: All goes well, how far
do you think you'll get today?

30:42.274 --> 30:43.409
He was taking full scoops.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.511
If we keep in this material,

30:45.544 --> 30:50.349
we'll probably at least get that
can down, and another can down.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.886
Well, tomorrow, you'll get to
the zone of interest for sure.

30:53.920 --> 30:58.024
NARRATOR: As the oscillator
drives the 26-foot sections

30:58.057 --> 31:01.227
of 60-inch wide caissons
into the ground,

31:01.260 --> 31:04.330
it is Rick Lagina's hope
that within one more day,

31:04.363 --> 31:08.901
the excavation will reach
a depth of 170 feet,

31:08.935 --> 31:10.269
where the team hopes
to encounter

31:10.302 --> 31:13.139
the so-called Chappell Vault.

31:23.983 --> 31:24.984
Son of a bitch.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.888
MIKE J.:
Oh, no.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.468
DANNY:
Buckets! We need buckets!

31:42.501 --> 31:44.236
NARRATOR: Having reached
an excavation depth

31:44.270 --> 31:47.406
of just 75 feet
in the D.M.T. shaft...

31:47.439 --> 31:50.076
Go grab me a pan or something
to contain all that.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.343
...the drilling oscillator

31:51.377 --> 31:53.179
has suddenly stopped working

31:53.212 --> 31:57.349
and is leaking massive amounts
of hydraulic fluid.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.917
SCOTT:
There it is. There it is.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.288
DANNY:
Probably just split it, eh?

32:02.321 --> 32:04.356
Split it, yeah.

32:04.390 --> 32:07.293
NARRATOR: The Irving team
has found a failed O-ring,

32:07.326 --> 32:11.697
a round gasket designed to seal
the hydraulic fluid needed

32:11.730 --> 32:15.567
for the oscillator
to safely operate.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.237
That O-ring was no match.
Poor little guy.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.538
ALTON:
No, he didn't stand a chance.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.440
Casualties of war.

32:21.473 --> 32:22.641
NARRATOR: But what has
caused the oscillator

32:22.674 --> 32:25.177
to suddenly malfunction?

32:28.180 --> 32:30.382
Yeah.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.386
We can't get
any material out, Mick,

32:34.420 --> 32:36.155
because of that obstruction.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.589
We may look at putting
the smaller grab on

32:37.623 --> 32:40.059
and go kind of around it.

32:40.092 --> 32:44.263
NARRATOR: An obstruction
at a depth of just 75 feet?

32:44.296 --> 32:47.333
Although the Irving team
is unable to advance the casing

32:47.366 --> 32:50.169
until the oscillator
can be repaired,

32:50.202 --> 32:53.172
they will attempt to break up
and remove whatever lies

32:53.205 --> 32:55.341
at the bottom
of the D.M.T. shaft

32:55.374 --> 32:58.610
using the hammer grab tool.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.279
It ain't a rock. I know that.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.380
-No.

33:01.413 --> 33:02.781
DANNY:
No.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.783
It's strong enough
to stop our grabber.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.186
What do you...
No sense of a boulder or...

33:07.219 --> 33:09.255
No, but like I said,

33:09.288 --> 33:11.423
it's strong enough to slow
that thing down on a free-fall.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.092
That's crazy.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.493
Lots of crazy things happening.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.795
DANNY:
Yeah, I know. I'm learning that.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.497
NARRATOR: Since it is
Danny Smith's opinion

33:18.530 --> 33:21.033
that the obstruction
is not made of rock,

33:21.067 --> 33:23.602
what could it possibly be?

33:23.635 --> 33:27.306
And is it natural or man

33:27.339 --> 33:29.075
Okay, so, how-how...
what do you want to do, then?

33:29.108 --> 33:30.442
DANNY: We're gonna,
we're gonna chisel it,

33:30.476 --> 33:32.378
-Right.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.580
We'll put the chisel on and
try to mash it out of the way.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.515
-That way he can get
his free-fall going. -Yeah.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.650
Okay, th-th-then
let's get on to it.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.253
See if that thing'll come up.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.755
NARRATOR: With all other options
proving unsuccessful,

33:43.789 --> 33:47.326
the team is resorting
to a four-ton, steel chisel bit

33:47.359 --> 33:49.295
in a calculated effort

33:49.328 --> 33:52.464
to penetrate
the mysterious obstruction.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.067
Using it as a type
of vertical battering ram,

33:55.101 --> 33:58.070
the device will be repeatedly
dropped down the shaft

33:58.104 --> 34:00.372
and onto the object below.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.174
If the bit can successfully

34:02.208 --> 34:04.343
break up
the mysterious barrier,

34:04.376 --> 34:07.413
the pieces will then be removed
by the hammer grab tool.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.319
What is the obstruction?
Is it steel?

34:13.352 --> 34:16.122
Is it a boulder?
Is it something else?

34:16.155 --> 34:17.656
What is this thing?

34:20.392 --> 34:23.562
And there's no record
of there being a casing

34:23.595 --> 34:25.364
an-anywhere near that hole.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.840
So if they can break it
and pull it

34:34.873 --> 34:37.809
or just smash it
out of the way...

34:37.843 --> 34:39.845
if they can get past it,
they can continue.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.480
At the end of the day,

34:41.513 --> 34:44.116
they got to get past
this obstruction.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.359
NARRATOR: It is
the Irving team's assessment

34:53.392 --> 34:55.494
that the chisel bit
may have broken through

34:55.527 --> 34:58.630
whatever was blocking
the D.M.T. shaft.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.367
They will now switch back
to the hammer grab tool

35:01.400 --> 35:03.769
in an attempt
to remove the obstruction

35:03.802 --> 35:07.673
so that their drilling efforts
can continue.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.376
GARY: Well, that's good, they've
started hammer grabbing again.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.711
Hopefully, it'll go through
whatever's stopping it.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.288
JACK: Well, hopefully they tore
it up with that chisel bit.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.514
NARRATOR:
Although the team from Irving

35:48.547 --> 35:50.582
believes they have
been able to begin

35:50.616 --> 35:53.919
breaking up the obstruction,
removing it, for some reason,

35:53.952 --> 35:58.324
is strangely proving
more difficult.

35:58.357 --> 36:01.327
Hey, Mike. Troubles?

36:01.360 --> 36:05.231
Well, i-it's not
something normal.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.366
Any of the pipes
that we ran into before,

36:07.399 --> 36:09.801
we were able to get through.

36:09.835 --> 36:14.240
The obstruction seems to be
in underneath the edge.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.842
Hopefully, it's gonna
work for us.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.810
We've-we'vtried
every scenario now,

36:18.844 --> 36:21.913
um, like, there,
right there again.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.250
It just felt like he-he got
ahold of something there

36:24.283 --> 36:27.353
and it slipped off.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.887
NARRATOR: While the team
continues their attempt

36:28.920 --> 36:31.623
to bring the mysterious object
to the surface,

36:31.657 --> 36:35.361
Jack Begley and Gary Drayton
begin searching

36:35.394 --> 36:38.930
the excavated materials
for artifacts and clues.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.705
GARY:
Oh. A tooth.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.641
No missing that.
That is for sure.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.843
Another tooth, Jack.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.412
JACK:
Yeah, I don't think

36:53.445 --> 36:55.414
they're gonna be happy
about this.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.483
NARRATOR: Finding cutting teeth
from the steel caissons

36:57.516 --> 37:00.519
in the spoils is
a concerning development.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.954
It means that whatever
the obstruction is,

37:02.988 --> 37:05.891
it is made of something
that the massive steel shaft

37:05.924 --> 37:08.627
may not be able to dig through.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.596
But if that is the case,

37:10.629 --> 37:13.599
what on earth
could the obstruction be?

37:13.632 --> 37:15.901
Well, mate, we'll see
if there's any more in here.

37:17.536 --> 37:18.470
JACK:
Another one right there, too?

37:18.504 --> 37:19.405
Yeah, probably another, yeah.

37:22.007 --> 37:25.311
: Oh, gosh.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.713
-Okay, that's two.
-GARY: Yeah. Yup.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.648
Three teeth.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.519
JACK:
Really dulled down.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.623
Shoot.
-Yup, even more.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.358
It's not good.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.893
This is not good at all.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.795
-Oh, Mike.
-Yes.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.764
Um, we have a problem.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.534
I hear. I see it. We-we just
all discovered it, I think.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.769
We're only just a little bit
into this pile

37:50.802 --> 37:53.472
and we have
a lot of teeth, yeah.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.974
MIKE J.: Now, we're on something
very, very solid.

37:56.007 --> 37:59.378
JACK: So, what happens if we
don't have any more teeth?

37:59.411 --> 38:02.714
You don't go any further.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.351
DAVE:
You're , son.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.885
Look at the state of that.
That's been chewed up.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.521
Oh.

38:09.555 --> 38:12.924
11 out of 36... we ain't
gonna have no teeth on it.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.628
There's another one in here.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.464
JACK: That was
our biggest fear come true.

38:24.370 --> 38:27.839
Rick Lagina and representatives
from Irving Equipment, Limited

38:27.873 --> 38:31.510
now gather to discuss
their possible options.

38:31.543 --> 38:34.480
Let me get
my brother's opinion here.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.418
RICK:
Hello.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.621
Hey, guess what.

38:42.654 --> 38:46.358
Houston, we have a problem.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.928
I-I'll let Mike and/or Danny
explain what's going on here.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.831
So, basically,
what we ended up with, Marty,

38:52.864 --> 38:57.135
uh, definitely feels like
we're on something very solid.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.939
Our casing is down 77 feet
and the casing has to come out

39:00.972 --> 39:03.542
to get the teeth replaced.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.514
RICK:
Shocking. I'm... yeah.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.583
Danny has suggested the
possibility of pulling the can,

39:11.617 --> 39:15.621
fixing the teeth,
moving the hole forward

39:15.654 --> 39:21.460
about a foot and a half
and-and restarting from surface.

39:21.493 --> 39:25.096
The other option is
to introduce flock and a camera

39:25.130 --> 39:27.633
tomorrow morning and try
to get a picture of it

39:27.666 --> 39:30.569
and see-see what's happening.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.838
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
and their partners,

39:32.871 --> 39:36.141
both options will cost
precious time, money,

39:36.174 --> 39:40.846
and perhaps a key chance to
solve the Oak Island mystery.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.482
If they choose
to begin a new excavation

39:43.515 --> 39:45.884
at a different location,
they run the risk

39:45.917 --> 39:48.787
of just missing their target.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.689
Why not try
to put a camera down?

39:50.722 --> 39:52.157
Put the big blue lights on it

39:52.190 --> 39:54.893
and you might see that
it's cutting into it.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.632
MIKE J.:
Yeah.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.601
All right.
We'll be on top of it.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.035
-Very good. Yup.
-We got a game plan.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.837
A game plan that we didn't
anticipate making.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.105
Exactly.

40:15.947 --> 40:19.150
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
and the Oak Island team,

40:19.184 --> 40:22.488
identifying just what
the mysterious obstruction

40:22.521 --> 40:26.024
in the D.M.T. shaft is, and
finding a way to get past it,

40:26.057 --> 40:28.694
are critical if they ever hope

40:28.727 --> 40:32.564
to reach what lies at
the bottom of the Money Pit.

40:32.598 --> 40:36.134
But if they are successful,
what will they discover?

40:36.167 --> 40:39.971
Priceless religious treasures
of the Knights Templar?

40:40.005 --> 40:44.576
Vast riches ingeniously hidden
by Spanish pirates?

40:44.610 --> 40:47.679
Or will they find
that on Oak Island,

40:47.713 --> 40:50.882
the price they may be required
to pay for the answer

40:50.916 --> 40:54.686
will come at too high
and too dangerous a cost?

40:57.288 --> 41:00.225
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:00.258 --> 41:01.927
-MIKE J.: We're gonna put
the camera in. -DANNY: On it.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.829
RICK:
Let's see what this thing is.

41:03.862 --> 41:04.896
DOUG: We come through
all that undisturbed ground

41:04.930 --> 41:06.532
and then hit something man-made.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.634
RICK:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Damn it.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.002
-GARY: Look at that.
-MARTY: Oh, my goodness.

41:11.036 --> 41:14.673
-That's clearly a keyhole.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.942
Oh. This was how
they smuggled gold.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.209
There was gold under this cross

41:18.243 --> 41:20.178
and the cross
was covered with lead.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.047
So there's a chance that they're
out in the Smith's Cove still?

41:22.080 --> 41:24.149
You want to rewrite history,
we're rewriting it now.
