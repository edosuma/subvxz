00:13.100 --> 00:16.200
Tonight - can we solve the fuel crisis?

00:16.200 --> 00:20.200
And, making a better police car -
how hard can it be?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.900
(Applause and cheering)

00:28.900 --> 00:31.200
Such a noise!

00:31.200 --> 00:32.800
Hello. Thank you.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.100
Hello!

00:36.100 --> 00:38.300
Hello and no.

00:38.300 --> 00:43.600
No, this is not a repeat, we really are back.
You're not watching Dave.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.900
(Laughter)

00:44.900 --> 00:47.300
Unless... Unless this is a repeat.

00:47.300 --> 00:52.700
In which case, let's remind ourselves
what we did in the summer series of 2008.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.400
Bullet train - pah!

01:01.500 --> 01:03.000
He's had it.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.300
Come on then, big fella,
let's see what you've got.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.200
(Horn)

01:15.200 --> 01:16.800
Hounds.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.200
Look at this.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
Very sorry.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.800
Oh, my God, the brakes!

01:29.800 --> 01:32.200
But let's not get hung up on fashion.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.400
Oh!

01:36.400 --> 01:38.700
I'm not talking. This matters.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.300
(Screams)

01:40.300 --> 01:41.800
- Oh!
- Oh, left, left, left!

01:42.500 --> 01:44.300
Ahh!

01:44.300 --> 01:46.100
Oh! Ha-ha!

01:47.900 --> 01:49.700
It's looking good.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.700
- Yeah!
- (Applause and cheering)

01:57.700 --> 01:59.500
There we go.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.100
So, the usual...

02:02.500 --> 02:08.100
The usual orgy of speed and...
and three middle-aged men falling over a lot.

02:08.100 --> 02:12.700
That actually gives us a bit of a problem,
because we've had a letter from the BBC,

02:12.700 --> 02:16.400
and they said, what with petrol
being L5.50 a gallon and all the rest of it,

02:16.400 --> 02:17.900
what we should actually be doing

02:17.900 --> 02:22.400
is giving some advice on fuel economy
and saving money.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.200
Yeah, unfortunately,
that letter was opened by him.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.600
- (Laughter)
- And I decided the best thing we could do

02:28.600 --> 02:33.000
- is get five supercars and have a race.
- (Laughter)

02:35.600 --> 02:37.300
These are the contenders.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.500
A Ferrari 599,

02:39.500 --> 02:41.500
a Lamborghini Murcielago,

02:41.500 --> 02:43.100
a Mercedes McLaren,

02:43.100 --> 02:45.100
an Aston Martin DBS,

02:45.100 --> 02:46.800
and the Audi R8.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.900
They will now race round our track.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.200
But to prove we're in tune with the times,

02:52.200 --> 02:56.100
each will start
with just one gallon in its tank.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.700
(Engines roaring)

03:05.400 --> 03:07.900
There you go,
the sound of the 20th century.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.900
God, I love it.

03:11.900 --> 03:19.300
5.4 liter V8 versus this 6.5 liter V12.
We're coming side by side

03:19.300 --> 03:21.600
into the first corner.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.100
There, blocked him out.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.600
Lamborghini's in the lead.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.800
- Whoops-a-daisy!
- (Tires squeal)

03:31.800 --> 03:35.200
The sight in my rear-view mirror now
is unbelievable!

03:38.600 --> 03:42.600
This was turning into one of the
most exciting races ever, on our track.

03:43.900 --> 03:47.100
And then it turned into one of the shortest.

03:47.100 --> 03:50.400
The Ferrari, it's gone, it's down, it's out.

03:50.400 --> 03:56.100
Amazingly, after just 1.7 miles
the Ferrari had spluttered to a halt.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.400
He's coming past.
There's nothing I can do.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.800
That McLaren is so quick.
You forget how quick it is.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.300
Shortly afterwards, the Aston was out too,
turning it into a three-horse race.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.000
Sorry, mate,
I'm gonna outbrake you here.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.100
I've got an Audi R8
right up my trumpet here.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.200
Then the McLaren took its last mighty swig.

04:30.300 --> 04:35.300
That noise coming from behind my left ear,
that's the sound of money exploding.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.700
My Lamborghini soldiered on bravely.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.800
Then, it ran out.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.200
Oh, no!

04:44.200 --> 04:49.500
It had done 4. 1 miles to the gallon -
an incredible performance.

04:52.900 --> 04:58.500
But the winner, with an incredible
five miles to the gallon is the Audi R8.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.400
So, here's a Top Gear top tip -

05:00.400 --> 05:02.800
if you've been affected by the fuel crisis,

05:02.800 --> 05:05.400
this is the supercar to buy.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.300
(Applause and cheering)

05:10.600 --> 05:14.300
- I like to think we provide a service.
- Yeah, nice one.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.000
And that is a useful piece
of consumer advice.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
No... But, seriously, that Ferrari,
did it really do 1.7 mpg?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.500
Well, there might've been a bit of fuel
left in its pipes.

05:25.500 --> 05:29.300
You'd be amazed how thirsty those things are
when you thrash them - it's incredible.

05:29.300 --> 05:35.300
1.7 miles means...
L3.23 a mile just in petrol.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.000
- Yes.
- The thing is, the BBC saw that film

05:38.000 --> 05:40.400
and they said we'd been stupid,

05:40.400 --> 05:43.500
and we had to do something
more for the normal person.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.900
And, well, it was him again.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.700
Yes, so the Toyota Prius.

05:47.700 --> 05:53.700
To make this as economical as possible, they go
to the ends of the earth, quite literally.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.500
I mean, the nickel that they use to make
the batteries that power the electric motor,

05:57.500 --> 06:00.200
that comes from a mine in Canada.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.100
Now, nickel mining is a filthy business -
a lot of sulfur and acid rain, but no matter.

06:04.100 --> 06:08.100
They load it on an enormous cargo ship,
send it to Europe, where it's refined,

06:08.400 --> 06:11.400
then on to China
where it's turned into a sort of foam.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.600
Then to Japan where it's put into batteries
and into the car.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.300
It's so complicated in fact,
to make a Prius,

06:17.300 --> 06:19.400
that a recent study found
that in the long term,

06:19.400 --> 06:22.600
it does more environmental damage
than a Land Rover Discovery.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.500
But... No, it's true.
But, it is at least economical.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.000
- (Laughter)
- Or is it?

06:31.700 --> 06:34.100
This is a BMWM3.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.600
It is not designed
to be as economical as possible.

06:39.300 --> 06:42.100
It is designed to be fast.

06:43.300 --> 06:48.100
So, ten laps of the track,
let's see which one uses the least fuel.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.100
Here we go.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.200
The Prius would be driven
as fast as possible.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.100
All I had to do in the BMW was keep up.

07:01.100 --> 07:04.700
OK, so there's a 1.5 liter 4-cylinder engine
in the Prius.

07:04.700 --> 07:09.800
In this, a 414 brake horsepower
four liter V8.

07:11.100 --> 07:15.100
You would expect this to use
massively more fuel.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.200
It was one of the dullest drives of my life,

07:22.200 --> 07:25.800
but in the interests of science,
I stuck with it.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.300
Coming up now, ten laps.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.700
And... we're finished.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.600
- I have the results here.
- Yes.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.100
The Prius did 17.2 miles to the gallon.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.500
The M3 did 19.4 miles to the gallon.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.300
- Hang on...
- That was verified.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.100
(Applause)

07:49.100 --> 07:51.700
- So...
- Seriously.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.300
- 19 to 17?
- Yeah.

07:54.300 --> 07:58.900
At that speed, the M3 is more economical
than a Prius.

07:58.900 --> 08:03.700
So, what he's saying is, if you want
an economical car, buy a BMW M3.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.200
No, I'm not actually.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.900
What I'm saying is, it isn't what you drive
that matters, it's how you drive it.

08:09.900 --> 08:13.800
That is everything. There's a load of people
right now who've got Mondeos,

08:13.800 --> 08:16.500
"I can't afford the petrol anymore,
I'm gonna have to get rid."

08:16.500 --> 08:19.300
Don't, cos everyone's in the same boat,
you'll get 20p for it -

08:19.300 --> 08:21.300
you'll end up with a horrid eco-box.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.700
Much better, don't change the car,
change your driving style.

08:25.700 --> 08:29.700
We will put our Top Gear top fuel-saving tips
on the website for you.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.700
- I think that's enough about fuel.
- Yeah.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.100
- Moving on.
- No.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.299
- What?
- No, it isn't enough about fuel, cos...

08:36.299 --> 08:38.900
Gather round, everyone.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.700
- You know a Securicor van?
- Yes.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.300
Driver's got a helmet, truncheon,
bulletproof glass.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.900
What've they got in the back -
50 quid, box of stamps?

08:46.900 --> 08:52.000
A tanker - 40,000 liters of fuel,
it's 50,000 quid,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.200
and all he's got to fend you off
is a rolled-up porn mag.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.300
(Laughter)

08:56.300 --> 08:59.800
Are you suggesting
people go out and steal petrol tankers?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.600
- Not people, no. (Quietly) Us.
- We do?

09:02.600 --> 09:05.900
We steal it. Put it in here,
Google Earth'll never spot it.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.400
- (Laughter)
- Honestly, cos if you think about it,

09:09.400 --> 09:14.700
- 50,000 liters of fuel, OK?
- That's a lot.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.500
That would be enough
to get your Mustang...

09:18.600 --> 09:20.200
...home.
- Really?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.600
- (Laughter)
- Well, to Guildford.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.500
And you could fill up there.
It's a brilliant idea.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.900
- Shall we do some proper news?
- No.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.900
No, because, you know every TV show
in the world now has a campaign.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.500
- No.
- They do.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.900
Jamie Oliver's going
"Don't eat chips, eat weeds."

09:35.900 --> 09:39.500
What's Gordon Ramsey's one? You gotta
kill your children's pets and eat them.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.600
(Laughter)

09:40.600 --> 09:44.000
So, I've come up
with a campaign we should do.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.800
- Oh, no!
- Road signs.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.800
Too late, they've already been invented.
Moving on.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.000
No, get rid of them.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.600
Councils these days, "Oh, there's a space,
we could put one in there,"

09:54.600 --> 09:56.100
and they just write rubbish.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.900
There's one on the M40,
it says "Spray possible."

09:58.900 --> 10:00.300
Well, it might be.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.700
It was a June day when I went past it.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.400
"Impossible" is what it should've said.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.500
If they're gonna list things that are possible,

10:07.500 --> 10:11.100
they could put "Being eaten by a cow -
possible."

10:11.100 --> 10:14.800
In the olden days, you used to be able
to have a crash

10:14.800 --> 10:17.700
and it was a foregone conclusion
you weren't gonna hit anything.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.700
Now, you're bound to hit a sign saying "Deer".

10:19.700 --> 10:21.900
- (Laughter)
- How do you know there's a deer?

10:21.900 --> 10:24.500
How do they know where the deer is?

10:24.500 --> 10:27.500
Why don't they just put the deer sign
on the deer?

10:27.500 --> 10:30.000
- (Laughter)
- That would work.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.200
Why don't they do that?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.900
There are stupid ones,
like the falling rocks sign.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.000
What are you supposed to do?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
- Speed up? Slow down?
- 195 mile an hour to avoid them.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.500
Why don't they stop the rocks falling down
if it's a continual problem?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.700
- That would be a better spend of money.
- It is.

10:44.700 --> 10:49.200
There's a very good sign near where I live.
It says "Changed priorities ahead."

10:49.200 --> 10:51.400
And it's right.
I was driving there the other day

10:51.400 --> 10:55.900
and I thought to myself "I'll work harder
and pay my mortgage off and be secure...

10:55.900 --> 10:57.800
- (Laughter)
- "...in my old age."

10:57.800 --> 11:00.800
I went past the sign and after
ten or twenty yards, I thought,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.000
- "No, I'm gonna go to the pub."
- (Laughter)

11:03.000 --> 11:04.400
- So, it works?
- Yeah.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.500
If you wanna join our campaign
to get rid of all road signs,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.400
or send us a picture of the
most pointless one you've ever seen,

11:10.400 --> 11:14.000
write to us at Top Gear... Christ,
we've moved offices, where are we now?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.300
- No idea.
- We're upstairs.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.400
- We're above The One Show now.
- Yes!

11:17.400 --> 11:20.500
There we are - Top Gear,
Above The One Show, London.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.300
- That'll find us.
- Now shall we do some news?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.300
- Can we have some proper news now?
- Yes. News from Korea.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.200
Hyundai's made a new coupÃ©,

11:28.200 --> 11:32.200
and I've got the sneaking suspicion
the designer sneezed when he got here.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.500
I think he may have been allergic
to the spaniel in his sandwich.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.500
(Laughter)

11:38.500 --> 11:41.400
Maybe his lunch bit his ankle

11:41.400 --> 11:44.800
Seriously, if you go to Korea,
don't order a cauliflower cheese,

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
- cos it won't be what you think.
- (Laughter)

11:48.100 --> 11:49.800
Anyway, this is called the Genesis,

11:49.800 --> 11:53.200
which probably means that
after a couple of years the front'll leave,

11:53.200 --> 11:55.300
and Phil Collins'll move in there instead.

11:55.300 --> 11:59.000
Strictly speaking, Phil Collins
will come round from the back

11:59.000 --> 12:00.300
to take place at the front.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.400
Leaving Chester Thomson at the back?

12:02.400 --> 12:05.500
Phil Collins will have to go back to the back
with Chester Thomson.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.600
- Yes.
- I don't know what you two are saying now.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.700
It's got a V6 engine, 3.8 liters

12:09.700 --> 12:13.100
and in between the bank,
you've got a 25-minute keyboard solo.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.400
(Laughter)

12:14.400 --> 12:17.000
You're using words but it means nothing.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.100
Would you rather it were called
the Hyundai Westlife?

12:20.100 --> 12:23.700
- Yeah, all right.
- The Hyundai Girls Aloud Hammond Edition.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.500
- All right. Thank you.
- (Laughter)

12:25.500 --> 12:28.400
You know that company that's bought Jaguar,
Tata?

12:28.400 --> 12:32.200
While we were off they made a big noise
about introducing a L1,500 car.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.800
Well, they've done it, here it is,
it's called the Nano.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.800
- Oh!
- Mm! The thing that worries me about this,

12:54.800 --> 12:59.400
it's like one of those Dr Who monsters
that has no facial features.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.300
Eurgh, it's just gonna terrify children.

13:01.300 --> 13:05.700
It has no features at all on it,
but this is the luxury version.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
That's the luxury one!

13:07.300 --> 13:10.100
How much more basic could it be?
What could you lose?

13:10.100 --> 13:14.700
Well, you know it isn't the base model
because if it was the base model,

13:14.700 --> 13:18.000
you wouldn't be able to see it
because the mule would be in the way.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.200
(Laughter)

14:10.200 --> 14:12.300
Hey, great news!

14:12.300 --> 14:15.200
- What?
- The Dacia Sandero is almost here.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.800
- When?
- Next year!

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
Great!

14:17.800 --> 14:20.900
- Now, the Toyota Urban Cruiser...
- (Laughter)

14:20.900 --> 14:24.900
That is the stupidest name I've ever heard of,
cos, forgive me if I'm wrong,

14:25.100 --> 14:27.400
but doesn't an urban cruiser wear a Mac

14:27.400 --> 14:29.700
and isn't allowed within 200 yards
of a primary school?

14:29.700 --> 14:31.100
(Laughter)

14:31.100 --> 14:34.600
- They may not have thought that through.
- That's not gonna work as a school-run car,

14:34.600 --> 14:37.300
if the police arrest it
every time it goes near the gate.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.300
(Laughter)

14:39.200 --> 14:40.900
Do you know
what's wrong with Ferrari at the moment?

14:40.900 --> 14:42.400
No, but I guess you're gonna tell us.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.800
- Yes, I am.
- I know what it is.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.200
It's that they spend too much time
making aftershave

14:46.200 --> 14:48.900
and crash helmets
that match the dashboard of your car,

14:48.900 --> 14:53.500
- even though you haven't actually got one.
- Well, that's true, but they're nerdy.

14:53.500 --> 14:57.000
It's the plumbing and the wiring
and the computer systems, that's the trouble.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.600
When I drive a Ferrari, I want it to be
all about passion and excitement.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.100
You might think this would fit the bill.

15:13.700 --> 15:18.100
That it's gonna be a ton and a bit
of Italian engineering for the soul.

15:20.800 --> 15:26.400
It's a tightened-up, stripped
and striped version of the normal 430.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.600
Sadly, though, it's called the Scuderia,
which is Italian for team.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.000
That means it has a silly name.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.000
It also has a silly grinning face.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.800
And wait till you see
what they've done to the inside.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Lamborghini and Porsche go to great lengths
with their light supercars

15:49.100 --> 15:53.600
to conceal how and where
all the weight has been saved.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.700
Ferrari were going to do that,

15:55.700 --> 16:00.300
but then they just decided that there's a really
good restaurant opposite the factory,

16:00.300 --> 16:03.300
and they went there instead
and just had some lunch.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.700
Look at itl

16:08.600 --> 16:10.200
There are no carpets,

16:10.200 --> 16:11.900
there's no satellite navigation,

16:11.900 --> 16:13.200
no stereo,

16:13.200 --> 16:19.200
no frills at all and it appears to have been
welded together by apes.

16:20.700 --> 16:26.300
You might imagine that because this
is missing 100kg of weight and equipment,

16:26.300 --> 16:30.300
it would be considerably less expensive
than the standard car.

16:30.400 --> 16:35.000
But no - that is L172,000.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.800
It's L43,000 more!

16:40.000 --> 16:42.200
There's more bad news too.

16:43.300 --> 16:48.200
It's got an even more complicated
computer system than the normal 430.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.800
Wires mean that it can change gear
in 60 milliseconds,

16:54.800 --> 16:57.900
and that, Ferrari say,
is faster than you can blink.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.300
That was 75 milliseconds.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.000
Come on, quicker, quicker!

17:05.599 --> 17:07.300
Right, I'm ready for a race.
Here we go,

17:07.300 --> 17:10.599
can it change gear
faster than I can blink? Are we ready?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.099
Steady.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.400
It can!

17:19.099 --> 17:23.099
In addition to the computerized gearbox,
it's got silicone brakes...

17:24.500 --> 17:26.599
...and an electronic differential.

17:28.700 --> 17:31.000
Then, there's this switch.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.900
When it's here, the traction control is on.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.700
When it's here, it's on a bit less.

17:36.700 --> 17:40.700
When it's here, it's off,
but the stability control is still on.

17:40.700 --> 17:44.700
Then, if I put it here,
beep-beep to tell me everything's off.

17:44.700 --> 17:49.600
And now the suspension's been firmed up
but I can make it soft again by pushing that.

17:49.600 --> 17:55.700
And if I had a side parting and adenoids...
(Nasal) I'd find all this very interesting.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.400
I'd come round to your house
and tell you all about how it works.

18:03.600 --> 18:08.100
Even the shape of the body
is computer-designed with speed in mind.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.300
It has winglets at the front,

18:11.300 --> 18:16.900
and at the back there's an undertray which
sucks you onto the road as you go along.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.500
So, the faster you go,
the more grip you have.

18:24.100 --> 18:27.500
One of the things that really annoys me
in most cars

18:27.500 --> 18:31.500
is that there are no slats at the back
to vent air out of the rear wheel arches,

18:31.800 --> 18:34.300
which of course increases pressure
and slows you down,

18:34.300 --> 18:36.200
but in this, it has the slats.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.300
Oh, yeah, definitely.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.900
All this speed is as a result of those sla...

18:47.900 --> 18:50.600
Actually, that is quite a lot of speed.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.400
(Laughs)

18:52.400 --> 18:54.700
Yeah, that was quite a lot.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.300
I wonder if it comes with bog roll?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.500
I'm doing this road test all wrong.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.100
Cos I'm mocking all this technology,

19:08.100 --> 19:09.900
and that's not really fair.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.800
It's not like Ferrari aftershave,

19:11.800 --> 19:17.600
or that stupid carbon-fiber crash helmet they'll
sell you to match the trim of your car -

19:17.600 --> 19:19.000
that stuff's for idiots.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.200
I want the computers, but I don't want them
to be the be-all and end-all of everything,

19:24.200 --> 19:26.700
like they are in the standard 430.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.300
I want them to be... there,

19:29.300 --> 19:34.400
but hidden away, buried under
a big thick layer of something else.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.200
And in the Scuderia... they are.

19:46.200 --> 19:50.100
This is not only lighter than the standard car,
but lower too.

19:50.700 --> 19:53.200
It has fatter tires and more power.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.200
It feels like it was designed
by Michael Schumacher...

19:58.200 --> 20:01.100
...and that's because, in part, it was.

20:02.100 --> 20:06.100
Now, I've got my foot buried
into where the carpet used to be

20:06.100 --> 20:11.300
and 510 brake horsepower
is roaming around the engine bay.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.900
Naught to 60 is dealt with
in three and a half seconds.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.300
Flat out, it'll be nudging 200.

20:20.400 --> 20:25.100
Round the Ferrari test track they claim
this is actually quicker than an Enzo.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.200
That said, it is a tricky car to drive fast.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.900
A knife-edge racer.

20:40.800 --> 20:45.300
This is what a Ferrari should be like.
(Italian accent) You make mistake, I kill.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.200
Whoa!

20:55.100 --> 20:56.900
Oh, dear, that's not gone well.

21:00.700 --> 21:04.100
It feels... It feels like a street brawler.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.500
It's angry!

21:08.200 --> 21:10.900
It feels like it wants to goose your mother,

21:10.900 --> 21:12.600
vomit in one of your flower beds,

21:12.600 --> 21:15.800
go to the pub, get drunk
and kick someone's head in.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.500
But listen, listen to the noise.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.800
(Engine roars)

21:23.800 --> 21:27.000
You only have to flex your big toe.
Oh!

21:27.000 --> 21:28.700
(Engine roars)

21:33.800 --> 21:37.300
It's like God having really unusual sex.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.400
Oh, there we are, he's finished.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.000
I cannot tell you
how happy it makes me feel...

21:47.700 --> 21:50.700
...to be driving a proper Ferrari again.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.200
(Applause)

22:03.100 --> 22:05.100
So much better than a normal one.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.300
I tell you what this car is,

22:07.300 --> 22:12.500
it is like the bastard love child
of Stephen Hawking and Rambo.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.700
And now we must find out
how fast it goes round our track.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.100
Which means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

22:18.100 --> 22:23.500
Some say that after making love,
he bites the head off his partner.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.000
(Laughter)

22:25.000 --> 22:29.700
And that he's had to give up binge drinking
now that it's got to L1.18 a liter.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.300
(Laughter)

22:31.300 --> 22:33.400
All we know is, he's called the Stig.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.200
He's off, and listen to the fury and
mighty vengeance of that 4.3 liter V8,

22:39.500 --> 22:41.900
as he powers up to the first corner.

22:41.900 --> 22:46.200
He's there already. A little four-wheel drift
on the way in there.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.100
Feathering the throttle and he's through.
That is very neat.

22:49.100 --> 22:52.600
0oh, of course,
the Scuderia doesn't have a stereo,

22:52.600 --> 22:54.700
so, no Stig audio nonsense,

22:54.700 --> 22:57.800
just the sound of Italian
mechanical rock and roll,

22:57.800 --> 22:59.600
or bewop, as we call it.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.500
Just look how neat it is.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.900
It's staggering.
Two gallons of fuel gone already,

23:05.900 --> 23:08.100
and... he's through the hammerhead.

23:08.100 --> 23:14.500
This... Compared to the normal 430,
the Scuderia has new inlets, new exhaust,

23:14.500 --> 23:17.700
a whole extra computer
just to control the spark plugs.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.000
Yet, despite the extra power,
Stig doesn't even need to lift...

23:21.000 --> 23:24.500
Coming up to the second to last,
look how controlled it is through there,

23:24.500 --> 23:27.600
and again through Gambon,
and across the line.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.100
- (Applause)
- Yeah!

23:33.100 --> 23:35.800
It's gonna be up there.
It's gonna be up there.

23:37.300 --> 23:43.600
It did it in 1:19.7,
so, it actually goes there,

23:43.600 --> 23:48.100
which means that it may be faster
than the Enzo round Ferrari test tracks,

23:48.100 --> 23:49.900
but it's not faster round ours.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.600
It's time now to move on

28:10.400 --> 28:13.400
and put some stars
in our reasonably priced car.

28:13.400 --> 28:17.400
My guests tonight, well, one of them
has very long hair and is from Bristol,

28:17.500 --> 28:20.300
the other one is from the Midlands
and is gay,

28:20.300 --> 28:23.700
but surprisingly, it isn't James May
and Richard Hammond.

28:23.700 --> 28:28.100
It is in fact Justin Lee Collins
and Alan Carr.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.100
(Applause and cheering)

28:36.800 --> 28:38.700
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

28:39.700 --> 28:43.500
The men from what was
The Friday Night Project...

28:47.500 --> 28:48.700
How was it out there?

28:48.700 --> 28:50.300
- Terrifying.
- Was it?

28:50.300 --> 28:51.700
Yes, really scary.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.000
In a Lacetti?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.800
Yeah,
but you're going very fast in the Lacetti.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.500
- Hitting 80 sometimes.
- (Laughter)

28:57.500 --> 28:59.600
Some hairpin turns.

28:59.600 --> 29:05.300
I kept doing that mirror, signal, maneuver,
and then I realized there was no other cars.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.800
I kept indicating, I'm serious.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.900
I have to say though,
for you it went quite smoothly today.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.600
- Yes.
- And for you, not so smoothly.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.200
No.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.800
We've actually got some clips of Justin
attempting his practice runs.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.800
- Anyone wanna see these?
- (Audience) Yes!

29:20.800 --> 29:24.600
Let's just have a look at Justin's first attempt
at getting round the track.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.800
Here we go, second to last corner and...
0h, nol

29:27.800 --> 29:29.100
Whoa!

29:29.100 --> 29:31.400
That's a long way from the trackl

29:33.300 --> 29:36.400
And here we go, Chicago,
that's understeer and that's...

29:37.500 --> 29:39.600
This isn't good, I'm off-road.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.200
I'm off-road!

29:42.200 --> 29:43.500
I'm back on-road.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.400
- I just killed a rabbit.
- (Laughter)

29:46.400 --> 29:48.000
- Did you get the rabbit?
- Yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.200
- Did you get it?
- I think I got a rabbit.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.300
Good, we'll go and pick that up later,
that's supper - mm, yum!

29:53.300 --> 29:54.700
Was the Stig nice to you?

29:54.700 --> 29:56.700
Very nice, yeah.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.100
It's Nigel Havers.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.300
(Laughter)

30:00.600 --> 30:03.800
Forgive me for doing this so early on,

30:03.800 --> 30:07.800
I've gotta know, cos... What is a gay car?

30:07.800 --> 30:11.200
I dunno. I'm not very clued up on cars.
I don't know...

30:11.200 --> 30:12.700
Are you the gay one?

30:12.700 --> 30:15.000
- Yeah, that's me!
- Oh, you're the gay one!

30:15.000 --> 30:17.800
- (Laughter)
- Right, so, you then...

30:17.800 --> 30:20.900
I don't know the makes of cars,
so I'm not that good.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.900
I remember...
I was telling you, weren't I?

30:22.900 --> 30:26.600
I remember when I came down to London,
me car, before I had me Mini,

30:26.600 --> 30:31.200
and I rang up for the congestion charge
and she said "What make is your car?"

30:31.200 --> 30:32.800
I said "I don't know."

30:32.800 --> 30:35.400
- Don't be so impertinent.
- I know!

30:35.400 --> 30:37.200
Did it not say on the steering wheel?

30:37.200 --> 30:41.200
I'm on the phone, I can't look.
I can't multitask, I'm gay.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.700
(Laughter)

30:44.100 --> 30:46.700
I've been looking at your car history -
what've you had?

30:46.700 --> 30:48.800
I've had a lot of... What's it called?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.900
Because I do stand-up comedy,

30:50.900 --> 30:52.900
before, I couldn't afford a car,

30:52.900 --> 30:56.700
so, I had to hire a car, and so,
cos I'm quite tight, I'd get the smallest one.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.400
Is it a Cinquento?

30:58.400 --> 31:00.800
Nearly. Cinquecento.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.400
- Cinquechee.
- Is Italian.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.100
- Is Italian for 500.
- I don't know anything.

31:06.100 --> 31:07.700
500. Just say 500.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.400
500.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.100
And they'd always be bright yellow,

31:11.100 --> 31:13.900
so you've got the shame
of driving a Cinquecento,

31:13.900 --> 31:17.300
and people going
"Oh, look, it's Mr. Happy."

31:17.300 --> 31:20.900
So, I had one of those,
then I had a Smart car.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.600
- I thought you were joking about that.
- No, I did,

31:23.600 --> 31:26.100
I was driving along
and this bin liner flies out -

31:26.100 --> 31:30.100
- I nearly drive inside a bin liner in a Smart car.
- (Laughter)

31:30.400 --> 31:31.800
I'm trying to find me lights...

31:32.800 --> 31:35.100
- In a Smart car...
- They are awful cars.

31:35.100 --> 31:38.900
It's kind to the environment, small cars -
is that something that bothers you?

31:38.900 --> 31:41.600
Well, listen, that's the good thing
about having a Cinquento,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.900
cos you can't car-pool,
cos you can't fit anyone in.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.600
That's a very good point.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.600
Would you pick up anyone? Have you seen
the people on the motorway?

31:49.600 --> 31:53.600
There's always some tramp waving you down
with a prostitute's head, going...

31:53.900 --> 31:55.300
- (Laughter)
- Going to York.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.600
Stay here!

31:57.600 --> 32:00.400
So, your car history, then. Any better, or?

32:00.400 --> 32:03.900
Started with an Escort,
then I had two Ford Orions.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.300
Oh, Christ!

32:05.300 --> 32:10.600
So, my car now is a new shape Honda Civic,
based on your review.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.100
- The review on this program?
- The review on this show.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.800
You bought a car on the strength
of what James May said?

32:15.800 --> 32:19.700
He's got long hair and he's from Bristol,
you can't go wrong.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.200
Is insurance an issue with you guys?

32:22.200 --> 32:24.400
- It is for you.
- It is for me.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.400
- Why for you?
- I lied for... Oh, can you say I lied for ages?

32:27.400 --> 32:28.500
(Laughter)

32:28.500 --> 32:31.100
- If you're not lying now, we'll get way with it.
- I'm not.

32:31.100 --> 32:35.100
I was a schoolteacher
who never left the house for a few years.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.800
(Laughter)

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
But then when I got on the telly,
I thought I'd better, because it is a bit...

32:42.000 --> 32:44.700
I thought, if I ever run anyone over,
and they realize it was me,

32:44.700 --> 32:48.500
- I'd have to reverse and kill them.
- (Laughter)

32:48.500 --> 32:51.300
You had Jamie Oliver in your car
the other day.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.300
No, you were in Jamie Oliver's car.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.800
Yeah, we were. He took us off-road.

32:55.800 --> 32:59.400
Before we got in the car,
he gave us a bin liner each to put on,

32:59.400 --> 33:01.300
and he said "You'll need those."

33:01.300 --> 33:03.600
What was he going to do to you,
for God's sake?

33:03.600 --> 33:05.100
That was the start.

33:05.100 --> 33:09.100
Then he gave us both a massive cream pie

33:09.200 --> 33:10.900
and big jugs of water.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.000
Said "Buckle up, we're going for a ride."

33:13.000 --> 33:17.400
I'm sorry. Jamie Oliver invites you
down to his house,

33:17.400 --> 33:22.000
and then makes you go in his Land Rover
in a bin liner with a cream pie?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.300
Yes, and a gimp mask.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.600
- Yeah.
- (Laughter)

33:26.600 --> 33:27.800
No, that's a lie.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.100
He's been eating too many weeds,
that's the trouble.

33:30.100 --> 33:32.200
And we go all over, didn't we?

33:32.200 --> 33:38.000
Up and down, and whoever had
the most pie and water in the thing won.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.300
So, we're like this.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.100
I've glassed you, haven't I?

33:41.100 --> 33:42.400
(Laughter)

33:42.400 --> 33:46.400
I'm wearing most of the cake as a brooch.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.700
I got my cream pie all in his lap.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.900
Nice.

33:50.900 --> 33:52.900
- It turns out my dinner...
- (Laughter)

33:52.900 --> 33:55.400
...my dinner parties are all wrong.

33:55.400 --> 34:00.900
Now, your show was the Friday Night Project,
is now the Sunday Night Project.

34:00.900 --> 34:03.800
So, you're paid to host this show,

34:03.800 --> 34:06.700
and then you get someone else
to come and host the show.

34:06.700 --> 34:09.100
- Yeah.
- It really works.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.300
(Laughter)

34:11.300 --> 34:14.600
It's annoying that, for me.
We have to pay Richard and James,

34:14.600 --> 34:17.000
who just bugger off at this point,
and smoke outside.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.900
James doesn't smoke.
His mother doesn't know.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.199
(Laughter)

34:21.199 --> 34:28.199
Now, the other one as well is, you spend a
long time with the guest hosts on your show.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.800
- Yeah.
- Are they a nightmare?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.900
Steven Seagal was a bit hard, weren't he?

34:31.900 --> 34:35.100
The first thing he said when he came in
"Are you two (BLEEP)?"

34:35.100 --> 34:37.900
(Laughter)

34:38.800 --> 34:42.100
I was like, "EnchantÃ©, Mr. Seagal,
you're so witty!"

34:42.100 --> 34:46.100
That was bleeped. What he said
was fornicating - are you two...

34:46.400 --> 34:49.000
- Oh, they've bleeped it. Sorry.
- No, it's all right.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.600
We said yes just to mess with his mind.
Yes, we are.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.600
Yes, we are. Would you like to see?

34:53.600 --> 34:56.300
- Imagine the children.
- (Laughter)

34:56.300 --> 35:00.700
Now, your laps. Obviously this is an unusual
thing, as we've got two people rather than one,

35:00.700 --> 35:04.000
so it isn't just a question of,
who do you think you've beaten here?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Who wants to go first?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
- Alan.
- Alan?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.300
- You go first.
- No, Alan.

35:09.300 --> 35:12.300
Unfortunately,
I don't know why I asked you that,

35:12.300 --> 35:14.700
cos you'll go in whichever order
they are in the machine.

35:14.700 --> 35:15.900
Oh, right.

35:15.900 --> 35:19.500
We're starting with... I've no idea
who it's going to be and it is...

35:20.800 --> 35:23.000
Who's that?
Who could it be?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.500
Come on, Bristol Flyer!

35:24.500 --> 35:25.600
It's youl

35:25.600 --> 35:29.600
More successful this time
than you were in the warm-up laps?

35:29.900 --> 35:35.300
Let's have a look. Coming up to the first
corner now. Cutting in the stabilizers...

35:35.300 --> 35:36.600
Ooh!

35:36.600 --> 35:39.000
- That's it.
- God, that was closel

35:39.000 --> 35:41.800
Chicago. Go off again this time?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.800
This is a wild drive.

35:43.800 --> 35:47.000
# My, my Delilah...

35:48.600 --> 35:51.400
Right, here we are, the hammerhead,
it's the tricky one.

35:52.700 --> 35:58.000
We've got a stopwatch as you cross this line
there. You were at one minute five seconds.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.800
# I saw the flickering lights...

36:02.500 --> 36:06.300
- This is quick. I'm impressed by this.
- Really?

36:06.300 --> 36:11.400
- # She was my woman
- I'm not impressed by that.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.100
(Laughter)

36:14.100 --> 36:17.600
#... watched and went out of my mind #

36:17.600 --> 36:20.500
And into the second to last corner.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.600
And coming up now, it's Gambon next.

36:23.600 --> 36:28.000
There it is. Wide, you've gone wide there
but you then cross the line.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
(Applause)

36:30.900 --> 36:32.900
- Slow.
- No, you weren't!

36:32.900 --> 36:34.300
It's slow.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.400
I haven't beaten Gambon.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.100
I haven't beaten Gambon, that was slow.

36:38.100 --> 36:44.200
You did it in one minute fifty... one...

36:44.200 --> 36:45.900
- Ah!
...point eight.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.900
So, you go and give him
a round of applause, everyone,

36:48.900 --> 36:52.900
- because he did it faster than Helen Mirren.
- (Applause)

36:53.900 --> 36:55.100
You beat Helen Mirren.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.400
Well done!

36:59.700 --> 37:02.800
You are officially a faster driver
than Helen Mirren.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.700
That's as close to Helen Mirren
as I'm ever gonna get. I love her.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.600
Enjoy it, you could be there a while.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.700
- Thank you.
- Shall we have a look at your lap?

37:09.700 --> 37:12.800
- Yeah!
- Ready, everybody? Play the tape.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.700
0h, dear, he's gone wrong already.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.100
It's the handbrake.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.300
(Laughter)

37:19.300 --> 37:21.900
And we're off.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.900
Oh, no, stop!

37:25.300 --> 37:26.700
Now, this is looking...

37:27.900 --> 37:29.900
"slow" is the word I'm looking for.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.500
(Alan) I thought I was quite fast.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.800
- That's tidy.
- (Bleep)

37:33.800 --> 37:35.100
(Laughter)

37:36.900 --> 37:39.500
What this is is tidy.

37:39.500 --> 37:42.400
Stig's gonna be so proud of me for that one.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.600
(Laughter)

37:43.600 --> 37:46.800
You definitely were listening to the Stig,
weren't you?

37:46.800 --> 37:48.000
Yeah.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.900
You see, the slower you go...

37:49.900 --> 37:53.800
He told me, go up to fourth gear
for the fast bits,

37:53.800 --> 37:55.100
and it was a revelation.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.000
There we go, this is fourth gear.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.900
Fourth, still fourth.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.900
- Whoa, it's quick!
- He told me fourth gear.

38:03.900 --> 38:06.800
That is quick. Now we've got
the second to last corner.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.000
(Alan) I look like 0live from 0n The Buses.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
- (Laughter)
- She's in that other car.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.400
Here we go and he's across the line,
he's made it.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.500
- (Applause)
- That was quick. Quicker than yours.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.800
Definitely quicker.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.800
Sub-1:50, definitely. That was quick.

38:23.800 --> 38:24.900
Ready?

38:24.900 --> 38:26.500
What was yours? One fifty one...

38:26.500 --> 38:27.900
Point eight.

38:27.900 --> 38:30.000
You were one fifty one...

38:31.600 --> 38:33.800
...two.
- Oh!

38:33.800 --> 38:35.400
- You are the quickest.
- Ah!

38:35.400 --> 38:37.800
- (Applause)
- Give him a big hand, everybody.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.300
Have a look at that.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.700
Oh, my God!

38:44.400 --> 38:46.500
Oh, thank you. Oh, my God!

38:46.500 --> 38:50.400
- Are you feeling humiliated?
- Yes, I was beaten by a much better man.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.300
I was listening to a bit of Smooth FM,
that chilled me out.

38:53.300 --> 38:56.300
But you had a really smooth start,
bang on the lines.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.600
- Oh, yes.
- Really smooth, looked slow, is faster.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.100
Looked slow, is faster - what a lovely thing,
I'll put that on my gravestone.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.600
(Laughter)

39:04.600 --> 39:06.700
"He looks slow but he drove fast."

39:06.700 --> 39:09.900
Listen, guys, it's been an absolute joy
having you here.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.400
Ladies and gentlemen, JLC and Alan Carr!

39:12.400 --> 39:14.500
- (Applause)
- Thank you so much.

39:19.300 --> 39:25.200
Now, you know those police crash action,
stop, kill, emergency programs?

39:25.200 --> 39:27.900
They're always full of brilliant stuff like this.

39:27.900 --> 39:29.900
(Sirens)

39:43.400 --> 39:45.000
Yeah, OK, that's great.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.300
Then the announcer comes on and he goes,
"We got a clip from England land,"

39:48.300 --> 39:52.000
and you die of shame
cos you know what's coming next.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.400
Here we go, yeah.

39:53.400 --> 39:58.000
It's a fat bobby in an Astra
and he's driven onto someone's lawn

39:58.000 --> 40:01.300
to get away from a teenager
who's throwing pebbles at him.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.600
- (Laughter)
- Now, the problem is,

40:03.600 --> 40:06.300
that the British police daren't crash their cars,

40:06.300 --> 40:09.200
cos they haven't got enough money
to fix them up again.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.700
That gave us an idea.

40:10.700 --> 40:14.400
Why spend L9,000
on a brand-new Astra diesel?

40:14.400 --> 40:18.100
Buy used cars, then when you crash them,
just get another.

40:18.100 --> 40:20.300
So, the producers
gave each of us a thousand quid,

40:20.300 --> 40:23.800
told us to buy something which we thought
would work as a police car.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.600
Then we were told to go to
the Top Gear Technology Centre,

40:26.600 --> 40:29.300
where we'd be given
a number of challenges.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.400
I was the first to arrive.

40:38.300 --> 40:42.100
OK, what I've got here is a Fiat CoupÃ©.

40:42.100 --> 40:47.900
I paid L900 for it, so the police could buy
getting on for ten of these,

40:47.900 --> 40:49.900
for the cost of one Astra,

40:49.900 --> 40:53.100
and this is the 20-valve five-cylinder
turbo version,

40:53.100 --> 40:56.200
so it does 152 miles an hour.

40:56.200 --> 41:00.600
And of course, if it were ever to appear on
one of those police crash accident programs,

41:00.600 --> 41:03.700
it would make our officers look rakish.

41:03.700 --> 41:07.400
Sadly, the same couldn't be said
of James's car.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.900
Masonry opens door, James.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.900
- Here, look, let me show you.
- Morning.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.000
To join the police
you have to be in the Masons.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
You've got a Mason's car, therefore
I'm doing the secret handshake. (Laughs)

41:18.100 --> 41:19.200
Morning.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.300
- It's a Lexus, James.
- It is, yes.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.700
- And you paid?
- L900.

41:23.700 --> 41:26.400
You could've had one of these.
I paid 900 for that. Much better.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.800
- OK, the police has a recruitment problem.
- Yes.

41:28.800 --> 41:31.700
So, you've got an advert saying
"Wanted, policeman to spend all day

41:31.700 --> 41:34.100
"driving around in very boring Lexus",

41:34.100 --> 41:38.500
or "Policeman wanted to drive 20-valve
turbocharged R-registered Fiat CoupÃ©."

41:38.500 --> 41:40.700
To the garage.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.600
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- Not yet.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.000
0ur argument was then brought
to a shuddering halt.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.800
- (Laughs)
- It is!

41:48.800 --> 41:51.100
Officer Barmy has arrived.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.700
(Laughs)

41:58.600 --> 42:00.000
Yeah!

42:00.000 --> 42:03.800
- They all run round in Range Rovers.
- This is the police, not a hairdressing salon.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.700
You see police in Range Rovers all the time.

42:05.700 --> 42:08.800
This is a budget,
but I think pretty nifty alternative.

42:08.800 --> 42:14.700
It is an 1994 Suzuki Vitara 1.6 JLX SE.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.800
How will it look when you go
to someone's house

42:16.800 --> 42:20.600
to tell them their husband's just been killed
in an industrial accident?

42:20.600 --> 42:22.500
(Laughs)

42:22.500 --> 42:25.300
# Deedly-dee-dee, deedly-dee-dee,
dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee!

42:25.300 --> 42:29.300
James and Richard then set about
my Don Johnson-mobile.

42:29.500 --> 42:34.400
So you're gonna climb into the cab of the
AA recovery vehicle and say "Follow that."

42:34.400 --> 42:39.100
"You're nicked and have you got a fan belt
for an old Fiat, cos it's back there."

42:40.400 --> 42:44.300
But I retaliated
by demonstrating a special feature.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.100
Can you open the boot?

42:47.100 --> 42:49.200
- You see?
- Yeah.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.000
An armed siege, OK?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.700
I'm pinned down in the car by Robert De Niro.

42:53.700 --> 42:57.700
I need to get at my M16. I just come through
here without getting out of the car.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.500
It really was time for a challenge.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.800
We don't yet know what we've got to do.

43:03.800 --> 43:07.800
Well, if it's go to Brighton and pose undercover
in gay clubs, you're right there already.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.800
(Laughter)

43:09.800 --> 43:14.100
- We've got a challenge here, boys.
- Don't let it have the word Brighton in it.

43:16.100 --> 43:20.700
"Now that you have your cars,
you must each use your skill and ingenuity

43:20.700 --> 43:25.600
"to turn them into the perfect modern
police car, for no more than L500."

43:25.600 --> 43:30.900
"You must meet up at the track for a series
of tests to find out which one is best."

43:33.000 --> 43:36.400
(James) A few days, and several pots of paint
later, we were ready,

43:36.400 --> 43:38.500
and I was the first to arrive.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.300
Morning all.

43:46.300 --> 43:49.600
Here's what I've done.
Classic British police livery, classic stripes,

43:49.600 --> 43:52.600
the inverted plant-pot blue light,
as you'd expect,

43:52.600 --> 43:55.200
and a mission statement for the modern age -

43:55.200 --> 43:58.900
"Catching crims and locking them up,
in your community."

44:01.200 --> 44:03.500
Oh, good God, the Carabinieri have arrived.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.500
Feast upon my magnificence.

44:07.500 --> 44:11.000
Hang on, stand aside. What's that?

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Boadicea conquered the entire Roman army
using something very similar to this,

44:15.000 --> 44:18.800
so I should be able to easily conquer
four hoodies in a stolen Datsun.

44:18.800 --> 44:22.200
What if you pull up by the pavement
and women and children are walking about?

44:22.200 --> 44:23.700
They'll have their legs cut off.

44:23.700 --> 44:26.400
"In jail no one can hear you scream" - scary.

44:26.400 --> 44:29.000
Boadicea wheel attachments - scary.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.300
You, presumably, have nothing.

44:31.300 --> 44:33.700
Wrong - these four nozzles...

44:33.700 --> 44:35.500
- Yeah.
...are paint guns.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.600
So, you drive in front of the crims
who are trying to get away.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.400
These fire a great cloud of pink paint
all over the windscreen

44:41.400 --> 44:43.100
and they have to stop cos they can't see.

44:43.100 --> 44:47.600
All you'll do with this is generate headlines -
police chop more people's feet off.

44:47.600 --> 44:51.200
All you're going to do with this
is respray the front of people's cars.

44:51.200 --> 44:54.100
James then demonstrated his siren...

44:54.100 --> 44:58.100
- (Chiming tune)
...which he'd got from an ice-cream van.

45:00.800 --> 45:04.000
They're gonna be really impressed with that
on an American police video.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.500
No, they stop for an ice cream
and then they're nicked.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.100
Mine was much more hi-tech.

45:09.100 --> 45:10.900
(Cow mooing)

45:10.900 --> 45:13.600
No, wait, that's the cow.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.400
Things were not going well...

45:17.300 --> 45:18.900
...and then they got worse.

45:21.900 --> 45:24.700
- (Neighing)
- Oh, God in heaven!

45:24.700 --> 45:26.100
The Pet Cop Boys are here.

45:26.100 --> 45:29.000
- Yeah.
- No, wait, The Police.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.200
Yeah, well, the police are coming -
the police.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.400
# Da-do-do-do, da-da-da-da #

45:33.400 --> 45:35.300
You saw me coming, didn't you?

45:35.300 --> 45:39.300
One problem the police face - getting someone
out of the way with blues and twos on.

45:39.300 --> 45:42.300
I've got a lot of blues and twos -
they will see me coming.

45:42.300 --> 45:43.700
I've gotta ask, OK?

45:43.700 --> 45:45.600
- You noticed that.
- Yeah, this is...

45:45.600 --> 45:48.000
It's genius. It's a stinger.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.600
OK, you get word over your radio
that you might need to stop a baddie.

45:51.600 --> 45:55.100
Rather than pulling out and blocking
with your car, which is dangerous,

45:55.100 --> 45:57.700
you just stop very quickly and then...

46:00.400 --> 46:03.900
It was unmistakably a doormat
with some nails in it,

46:03.900 --> 46:05.800
so we moved on.

46:06.900 --> 46:09.800
"A police car has to be fast.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.900
"To see how quick your cars are,

46:11.900 --> 46:14.000
"the Stig will now drive one timed lap

46:14.000 --> 46:19.200
"in the standard British police issue
Vauxhall Astra diesel.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.200
"All you have to do is beat his time
in your cars.

46:22.200 --> 46:26.200
"Bonus points will be awarded
for flamboyant driving style,

46:26.400 --> 46:30.400
"which will look good
on a police kill action program."

46:30.600 --> 46:32.100
- Yes.
- Yes!

46:32.100 --> 46:34.200
- Right!
- Flamboyant and fast.

46:34.200 --> 46:36.000
Only one person can win this.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.200
Three, two, one.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.900
(Siren)

46:45.400 --> 46:47.200
He's proceeding in a westerly direction.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.700
Giving the British police cars like that
to save money

46:52.700 --> 46:56.200
is the same as the Queen saying "Changing
the guard, they can all wear Primark."

46:58.700 --> 47:02.400
Here come the British army, they're wearing
beach towels because that saves money.

47:04.300 --> 47:07.100
How would the Blues Brothers have looked?

47:09.200 --> 47:12.000
And there he is. How long?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.400
One minute forty-eight.

47:14.400 --> 47:18.800
1.48 is quicker than most of our celebrities
drive round here in the Lacetti.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.900
- Is it?
- Yes. "Is it?"!

47:21.200 --> 47:22.600
Then it was our turn,

47:22.600 --> 47:25.000
and The Gentle Touch went first.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.900
Three, two, one, go.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.700
- Well, that began.
- He pulled away.

47:31.700 --> 47:32.900
I pulled away.

47:32.900 --> 47:38.800
Sadly, James's idea of flamboyant driving
isn't quite the same as everyone else's.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.300
That'll look excellent.

47:41.300 --> 47:43.200
I wonder if it's got traction control.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.000
I don't think it's necessary.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.600
A tire squeal from the 1970s.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.800
Left.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.500
I hope you like prison food, crims.

47:56.700 --> 47:58.100
Looking good.

47:58.100 --> 48:00.000
Cock.

48:01.200 --> 48:03.900
- A bit of tire squeal.
- We better get out of the way.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.500
(Laughs)

48:09.200 --> 48:11.100
Oh!

48:11.100 --> 48:12.800
Can I help you, sir?

48:13.300 --> 48:14.600
That's not bad.

48:14.600 --> 48:17.900
It's two minutes point 03.

48:17.900 --> 48:20.100
Two minutes, James!

48:22.100 --> 48:25.200
I was next to give it a bash in my Fiat.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.700
But before I do, I wanna make it look good,
so I brought this.

48:28.700 --> 48:31.600
- Oo-er.
- Right, you're on your own.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.500
You see, you go for the soft focus.

48:34.500 --> 48:39.200
Now, when I set off,
that swooping J turn, soft focus.

48:39.200 --> 48:42.100
(Richard) You're just going for extra points
for flamboyance.

48:47.900 --> 48:50.600
Oh, damn and blast!

48:50.600 --> 48:53.300
- Oh, that's good.
- A lot of points there.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.000
Are we in soft focus as well?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.400
No.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.100
Ah, I fear my...

49:03.100 --> 49:08.700
Yes, I fear the Boadicea wheel attachments
have affected the wheel balance somewhat.

49:08.700 --> 49:11.600
- It wasn't an option on the original car.
- No Boadicea spikes.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.500
You didn't hear people saying,
"I've got a Fiat CoupÃ©,

49:14.500 --> 49:18.100
"it's great, but I just wish the rear wheels
were a bit heavier and out of balance."

49:21.200 --> 49:24.100
Gotta look good. They're gonna cut in
for a shot of the driver.

49:30.500 --> 49:34.400
I hear a lot of noise, but not a lot of movement.
It's very much like Jeremy, that car.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.800
- I'm suggesting getting back.
- Yeah.

49:39.800 --> 49:42.600
I'm thinking further.
With those things on the side.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.500
Further still.

49:46.500 --> 49:48.400
And then a flourish to the finish...

49:50.100 --> 49:52.400
...and flash the lights.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.400
What about that?

49:54.400 --> 49:56.100
What did I do it in?

49:56.100 --> 49:58.000
Two minutes dead. (Laughs)

49:59.900 --> 50:01.600
Two minutes and eight seconds.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.700
- What, slower than yours?
- Yes, sir.

50:03.700 --> 50:06.200
But without the J turn.

50:06.200 --> 50:09.000
You chose to do the J turn.
We didn't make you.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.900
You can't go up to a villain as a police officer,
"I didn't mean that."

50:12.900 --> 50:14.800
Can you come back
while I do my J turn again?

50:14.800 --> 50:16.600
- Do you mind?
- What?

50:16.600 --> 50:19.000
- Accept I won.
- Well, you just didn't.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.800
And finally,
from the Streets 0f San Francisco.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.700
One, go!

50:25.900 --> 50:27.000
Yeah.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.900
- He's got four-wheel drive, hasn't he?
- Yeah.

50:30.900 --> 50:34.800
I lose the drama of the start
but at least it means I can go... (Bang)

50:34.800 --> 50:36.600
I'm not in four-wheel drive anymore.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.900
Painfully slow.

50:39.900 --> 50:43.600
How can I do flamboyant driving in this?
I need points.

50:47.800 --> 50:51.100
Oh, no, he's broken the thing off.
He's broken his tongue.

50:51.100 --> 50:53.700
- I deployed my stinger there.
- Is he still on the...

50:53.700 --> 50:55.300
Hello!

50:56.500 --> 50:58.900
Oh, yeah, look at that!

50:58.900 --> 51:00.300
That'll look good in slow-motion.

51:00.300 --> 51:02.400
- You never thought to do that.
- I didn't.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.100
Past the gratuitous boxes.

51:07.100 --> 51:08.600
That was to make it look good.

51:08.600 --> 51:12.600
Step back, because who knows,
handling-wise, what might happen there.

51:13.700 --> 51:15.700
It's packing up.

51:22.300 --> 51:25.600
- It's gotta be points off for that.
- Yeah. That's not flamboyant.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.600
(Jeremy laughs)

51:33.000 --> 51:35.100
There's an electrical problem.

51:36.700 --> 51:39.600
Three minutes fourteen.
Have you seen the front of your car?

51:39.600 --> 51:43.600
Yeah, but, you see, you get points
for flamboyance, remember.

51:43.700 --> 51:45.700
Think of the spectacle I've just given.

51:45.700 --> 51:48.400
I'm gonna give you a big push and off.

51:49.800 --> 51:52.200
- Go.
- (Engine sputters)

51:58.400 --> 52:00.500
What is it? Ambitious but rubbish.

52:01.900 --> 52:06.800
(Richard) For our next challenge we were told
to hot-foot it to the scene of an accident.

52:06.800 --> 52:08.400
(Ice-cream chimes)

52:15.900 --> 52:20.900
"As you can see, the road has been blocked
with a crash." This here. You see?

52:20.900 --> 52:25.500
"Normally, it would take authorities six hours
to get the road open again.

52:25.500 --> 52:28.800
"You will now demonstrate that it's possible
to be much quicker than that."

52:28.800 --> 52:31.900
Well, it is, we don't have to
wrap them all in tinfoil blankets,

52:31.900 --> 52:33.800
we don't have to offer them counseling,

52:33.800 --> 52:37.200
we don't have to fill in health and safety forms
until a week on Tuesday.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.900
- We can clear this in no time.
- This is our chance to prove it.

52:39.900 --> 52:44.300
"If you haven't got the job done in two minutes,
motorists will be allowed to pelt you with food."

52:44.300 --> 52:45.200
Good idea.

52:47.700 --> 52:51.700
(James) With the clock ticking, Richard and I
decided to take care of the cars,

52:51.900 --> 52:54.300
while Jeremy took care of the wounded.

52:56.100 --> 52:58.700
We were working well as a team.

52:58.700 --> 53:00.300
I'm towing that car!

53:00.300 --> 53:02.000
Sort of.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.500
I've got a live one here.

53:04.500 --> 53:08.000
And as a result,
we had most of the wreckage...

53:08.000 --> 53:11.100
...and the bigger body parts,
cleared in good time.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.900
The road is clear.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.900
While we've been busy at the crash scene,
the real police had turned up.

53:26.900 --> 53:31.900
They wanted to demonstrate the official
procedure for stopping a stolen car.

53:31.900 --> 53:35.000
The operator will dispatch a police vehicle.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.400
Yeah, Hotel Papa Nine One,
Lima Three Seven Five, Tango Papa Tango,

53:40.400 --> 53:44.000
a BMW, color silver, lost/stolen report. Proceed.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
Throughout this, the pursuing vehicle
will be giving a commentary

53:47.000 --> 53:49.800
for all the vehicles
that are engaged in this stop.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.500
The vehicle is failing to stop, failing to stop.

53:52.500 --> 53:56.300
The vehicles will be given instructions
to move off by the pursuing vehicle.

53:56.300 --> 53:58.500
It does seem like quite a faff.

53:58.500 --> 54:01.000
- It is a palaver, to be honest.
- Very involved.

54:02.400 --> 54:08.500
You know they have to fulfill 13 separate health
and safety criteria before they can do this.

54:08.500 --> 54:09.700
He could be abroad by then.

54:09.700 --> 54:13.000
Once the criteria's fulfilled,
they will attempt to stop the vehicle.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Nearside, nearside.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.400
And under the instruction
of the grand commander,

54:17.400 --> 54:19.400
they will get the vehicle into position,

54:19.400 --> 54:22.200
where they can surround it,
box it and stop it.

54:22.200 --> 54:25.800
Just wind the window down,
draw alongside and blow his head off.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.400
Or, ram him off the road.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.100
Keep it rolling.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.000
The police won't ram him off the road

54:31.000 --> 54:33.400
because their cars are valuable -
about 30 grand each.

54:33.400 --> 54:36.100
Straighten up and stop, stop, stop.

54:36.100 --> 54:37.900
This is where our idea comes in.

54:37.900 --> 54:41.800
And for once, the challenge
was just what we'd hoped for.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.900
"You will now demonstrate to the police

54:43.900 --> 54:47.100
"how your cheap cars can be used
to stop a stolen car,

54:47.100 --> 54:52.300
"without using L125,000 worth of Volvo,
the RAF,

54:52.300 --> 54:55.200
"and 16 health and safety forms.

54:55.200 --> 54:58.000
"And just to make your task
that little bit harder,

54:58.000 --> 55:01.800
"the BMW will be driven by... Ronnie Stiggs."

55:01.800 --> 55:02.900
Oh!

55:05.300 --> 55:09.800
Keen to try out his paint gadget,
Inspector Morose went first.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.300
There goes a member of the criminal classes.

55:13.300 --> 55:16.400
So, we're now watching James
in a hot pursuit situation?

55:16.400 --> 55:19.900
Yeah. How long have you got
before you have to go home tonight?

55:21.900 --> 55:24.300
- He's shuffling!
- He's giving it the police shuffle.

55:24.300 --> 55:27.500
Shuffling the wheel according to
the police roadcraft driving manual.

55:27.500 --> 55:30.900
- Hang on, James's plan is to deploy his paint.
- Yes.

55:30.900 --> 55:35.800
Now that relies entirely
upon him being in front of anybody else.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.700
(James) Luckily, I had a plan.

55:38.700 --> 55:40.400
Right, watch this.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.800
(Jeremy) I know what he's doing.

55:41.800 --> 55:45.700
He's gonna wait for him to come round again,
and then pick him up.

55:45.700 --> 55:49.500
I can see the miscreant approaching
in my rear-view mirror.

55:49.500 --> 55:53.100
But this sitting around waiting for the baddie
to come round again!

55:53.100 --> 55:55.300
It could work on the M25 perhaps.

55:57.800 --> 56:00.300
(Ice-cream van chime)

56:00.300 --> 56:02.200
He's pounced, he's pounced.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.400
- Now, is he deploying?
- No!

56:07.400 --> 56:09.600
- Oh, I say!
- It works, look at the windscreen!

56:09.600 --> 56:11.700
- It works!
- That is brilliant.

56:11.700 --> 56:13.100
I'm amazed.

56:13.100 --> 56:16.400
Sadly, there was one invention
James hadn't considered.

56:18.700 --> 56:21.700
- (Richard laughs)
- Well, he's just put his wipers on!

56:24.100 --> 56:26.700
(James) So, would Hammond have any success?

56:29.200 --> 56:33.200
So, a 1.6 liter... salon.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.400
Come on, come on, come on, give chase!

56:36.400 --> 56:38.100
No, look, that's pathetic.

56:39.300 --> 56:41.600
I'm a police officer, I shall never give up.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.400
- Ah!
- Ah, you see!

56:44.400 --> 56:46.900
Now, thanks to four-wheel drive,

56:46.900 --> 56:50.400
I could intercept the Stig
and deploy my stinger.

56:51.100 --> 56:55.700
(Jeremy) This is L900 plus a bit of doormat
with some nails in it. Here we go.

57:00.600 --> 57:02.100
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

57:02.100 --> 57:04.100
(Jeremy, laughing) He missed!

57:05.200 --> 57:08.200
- (James) Oh, no, he's driven round it.
- (Both laugh)

57:08.200 --> 57:11.100
The stinger needs to be longer.

57:11.100 --> 57:17.100
(James) Now, all hope of succeeding in this
challenge rested with Commodore Clarksonio.

57:18.200 --> 57:20.900
In Jeremy's mind,
this is already a magnificent spectacle.

57:20.900 --> 57:23.900
What I like to do is play music... loud.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.600
It scares the hell out of them.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.600
It's Robert Duvall, mate.

57:31.300 --> 57:34.200
I'm gonna try something
the Americans call pitting.

57:34.200 --> 57:38.500
If I put my car along his rear wing
and push his back end out.

57:38.500 --> 57:43.900
He counter-steers, I then brake
and of course, it shoots the other way.

57:43.900 --> 57:47.900
Unfortunately,
none of what I just said happened.

57:49.900 --> 57:51.200
So, there's nothing for it.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.300
I'm gonna deploy my Boadiceas.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.900
I don't think he'll take Stiggs alive.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.900
Any second now.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.200
Oh, that's uncomfortable.

58:06.200 --> 58:07.600
I presume at some point

58:07.600 --> 58:10.100
- there's gonna be a simply hideous accident.
- Yeah.

58:10.100 --> 58:12.200
Come on!

58:13.000 --> 58:14.900
Yeah, take that!

58:21.500 --> 58:24.500
(Richard) I think it could be time
to admit failure.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.900
- See.
- That could've been, erm...

58:28.200 --> 58:30.600
Something's gone wrong with the handling.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.000
You lot failed to apprehend the miscreant.

58:36.100 --> 58:37.400
We are rubbish.

58:37.400 --> 58:40.300
We're not doing as well
as we thought we would.

58:40.300 --> 58:42.000
(Applause)

58:48.700 --> 58:50.000
OK...

58:51.300 --> 58:52.800
...the scores.

58:52.800 --> 58:55.000
Right, the scores, so here we go.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
First, cost - you got a point for every pound
you were under a thousand,

58:58.000 --> 59:01.800
so, James, a hundred for you, Jeremy,
a hundred, two hundred and fifty.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.900
- Was your car 750 quid?
- Yes, it was.

59:03.900 --> 59:05.700
- (Laughter)
- It was.

59:05.700 --> 59:09.700
Then speed. You get a point for every
second you were faster than the Stig,

59:09.700 --> 59:11.700
or lose one for every one you were slower.

59:11.700 --> 59:15.700
James, minus 12 for you,
minus 20, Jeremy, minus 72 for me.

59:15.900 --> 59:17.500
Rightly so.

59:17.500 --> 59:19.900
Then flamboyance.
How flamboyantly you drove.

59:19.900 --> 59:21.900
I've got the judges' results here.

59:21.900 --> 59:25.700
James, they said you weren't flamboyant,
you got nothing, sorry.

59:25.700 --> 59:28.100
- (Laughter)
- No points at all.

59:28.100 --> 59:31.100
Then Jeremy,
neither were you, none, sorry.

59:31.100 --> 59:33.300
- I did a J turn!
- You put Vaseline on the lens,

59:33.300 --> 59:35.600
- we couldn't see it, you fool!
- That's rubbish!

59:35.600 --> 59:37.700
I got a point for driving through the boxes.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.900
Your tongue fell off.

59:39.900 --> 59:41.700
A bit, a bit. I made it.

59:41.700 --> 59:45.100
- This is ridiculous!
- Finally, the decider, arresting the Stig.

59:45.100 --> 59:48.600
OK, James, you got nothing for that.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.000
- That gives you 88.
- You didn't get him.

59:51.000 --> 59:57.300
I got nothing, so that gives me 179.

59:57.300 --> 59:59.700
You've been building up tension,
haven't you?

59:59.700 --> 01:00:04.900
So, if I get a hundred for my Boadiceas,
I've won.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.500
- Yeah.
- Did I?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.100
- No, funnily enough, no.
- (Laughter)

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:13.900
- You got 98, which means you get 178.
- (Laughter)

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.100
- I'm sorry, no, hang on, hang on.
- (Applause)

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.900
No!

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:25.900
Show me... where it says I conveniently
ended up with one point less than you.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.500
- No.
- (Laughter)

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.700
You've eaten it?

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.500
Yes, I have.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.800
(Laughter)

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.800
Well, since I'm not prepared
to go through your stools in the morning...

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.200
Oh, well.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.000
...we have to conclude that the best car
for the British police

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.700
is a Suzuki Vitara
with a doormat on the front.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.400
- (Laughter)
- Yes.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.100
And on that blatant lie, it's time to end.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.100
Thanks for watching,
we'll see you next week.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.200
Or, if you're watching this on Dave,
we'll see you in a minute.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.400
Take care, bye-bye.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.800
(Applause)
