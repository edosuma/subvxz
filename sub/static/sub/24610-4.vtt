00:02.459 --> 00:05.293
Okay, keep coming...

00:06.696 --> 00:10.065
- Looking good, keep coming...
- Can I just take it off?

00:10.066 --> 00:14.568
- No, shut up, keep coming...
- Really not liking this.

00:14.604 --> 00:17.004
Well, but once you see
the surprise, keep coming,

00:17.040 --> 00:19.306
you're gonna forget all
about being mad about the map.

00:19.342 --> 00:22.400
That's what I'm saying, if the
goal here is to unpiss me off...

00:22.435 --> 00:24.746
- Oww! What the...?
- Sorry, go left?

00:24.747 --> 00:29.149
- Goddamn it!
- Wait, hang on, wait, wait, wait!

00:29.184 --> 00:32.119
- Wh...?! What the...?
- Ta-da!

00:32.121 --> 00:35.423
- What the actual goddamn shit?!
- Yeah, right?

00:35.424 --> 00:37.925
At first, I was like, "pfft,"
but then I was like "myeah?"

00:37.926 --> 00:39.460
What'd you...
What have you done?!

00:39.461 --> 00:41.895
Well, I used the all the ribs,
they were in pretty good shape,

00:41.930 --> 00:43.864
the spans are the toughest
bamboo I could find...

00:43.899 --> 00:45.199
- I helped.
- Shut up.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.368
Then I covered 'em with
canvas sails, and doped

00:47.369 --> 00:49.536
the whole thing up tighter
than dick's hatband!

00:49.537 --> 00:52.705
- Hey, whoa!
- Dick's hatband?! Dick's hatband?!

00:52.741 --> 00:54.485
- Yeah, I dunno.
- People say that.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.411
- Right?
- You big dumb ox! You ruined her!

00:57.412 --> 01:00.680
B-But...
I thought you'd be happy!

01:00.715 --> 01:04.881
Happy?! You thought I'd
be happy? I oughta...

01:04.955 --> 01:09.496

01:14.929 --> 01:17.897

- Huh?

02:27.933 --> 02:29.699
Where'd ya go, buddy?

02:30.702 --> 02:33.605
Spain...

02:33.640 --> 02:37.807
Heh. Oh, man.
Is Spain not the best?

02:37.843 --> 02:40.297
C'mon, tapas?

Archer, hey, c'mon...

03:21.932 --> 03:27.636
C'mon. C'mon, snap out of it, bub,
'cause, uh, we got company.

03:27.671 --> 03:29.804
Huh? What-what...?
Wait, where am I?

03:29.840 --> 03:31.474
Right here with me and Crackers.

03:31.475 --> 03:32.808
- Ugh.
- Hey...

03:32.809 --> 03:35.645
- Question is, where were you?
- Pam, it was the damnedest thing.

03:35.646 --> 03:37.478
All of a sudden I was back in Spain,

03:37.514 --> 03:39.547
getting shot down by that
son of a bitch Ziegler.

03:39.582 --> 03:41.783
Yeah, so...

03:41.818 --> 03:43.752
- Which time?
- What the hell?!

03:43.787 --> 03:46.454
- Yeah, so, funny story...
- Ziegler?!

03:46.489 --> 03:49.391
Hallo, Archer. Heh.
You are flying a garbage truck now?

03:49.392 --> 03:51.726
No, I...
Wait, how are you here?!

03:51.762 --> 03:55.564
- It is an incredible coincidence, ja?
- Literally incredible.

03:55.565 --> 03:57.431
So, does this place have a bar?

03:57.467 --> 03:59.833
I owe you a drink, you
have made me famous.

04:03.906 --> 04:07.778
<i>- Das is die umgekerht Ace?!
- Ja! Es war er!</i>

04:09.245 --> 04:10.812
This means the "reverse ace."

04:10.813 --> 04:14.114
Because in Spain I shot
him down five times.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.449
- We know.
- Plus not to mention his eye...

04:16.485 --> 04:18.851
Then why did you...?

04:18.887 --> 04:20.588
- And why the hell are you here?!
- Well, I...

04:20.589 --> 04:22.756
I don't see how that concerns you.

04:22.792 --> 04:26.236
<i>- Hauptmann Ziegler?
- Ah, sie sind bestimmt Herr Fuchs.</i>

04:29.844 --> 04:33.166
Oh. So, hey, Archer, please
let me buy you that drink, eh?

04:33.202 --> 04:36.969
- Come find me later.
- Oh, don't worry, I'll find you.

04:37.005 --> 04:41.196
Well, that would be a first.

04:47.648 --> 04:51.550
Man. So the guy who shot
you down all those times,

04:51.586 --> 04:54.688
shot your eyeball out, he shows
up on the same teeny tiny island,

04:54.689 --> 04:57.857
halfway around the world?
I mean, what're the odds?

04:57.892 --> 05:00.125
- Literally zero.
- Shut up, bird.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.428
Eh.

05:01.429 --> 05:03.562
- So... you okay?
- Hm?

05:03.598 --> 05:08.734
Oh, yeah. No, I'm fine,
I'm good, I'm totally good, I'm...

05:11.839 --> 05:13.805
God...

05:15.115 --> 05:16.641
Damn it!

05:18.511 --> 05:21.613
No, I am good, I'm great.

05:21.648 --> 05:24.116
'Cause I'm gonna kill him.

05:24.151 --> 05:25.984
Alright, Missy, we need...

05:26.019 --> 05:27.886
to have a little talk.

05:27.921 --> 05:29.721
Now, I don't know what you studied

05:29.757 --> 05:32.990
at whatever fancy-pants
finishing school you went to...

05:33.025 --> 05:34.159
- Finch.
- What?

05:34.160 --> 05:38.930
- I went to Finch?
- No one cares. But can I assume

05:38.931 --> 05:40.965
they didn't teach you
business management?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.502
- I don't know.
- Well, now you are a business.

05:44.537 --> 05:46.971
In which I've made a major investment...

05:47.006 --> 05:52.243
- Pfft, what, bear claws and brandy?
- And a roof over your head.

05:52.278 --> 05:54.745
And so far, you're not
making me any money.

05:54.781 --> 05:56.414
Well, how can I?
Look at this place.

05:56.415 --> 05:58.083
There's hardly ever anybody in here.

05:58.084 --> 06:01.952
Well, what about him?
Did you ask him about a date?

06:01.988 --> 06:03.921
- I asked them both.
- Seriously?

06:03.956 --> 06:06.890
Ugh! I'll try again after
they finish that sherry.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.660
I-I... I think she was on the fence.

06:09.695 --> 06:13.597
- Wait, what about him?
- Ohh, no.

06:13.632 --> 06:16.933
He is strictly off limits.
And if I catch you sniffing around...

06:23.308 --> 06:24.241
What in the...?

06:24.242 --> 06:26.242
<i>Eh... parlez-vous Français?</i>

06:26.278 --> 06:28.078
- English.
- Good, better.

06:28.079 --> 06:29.913
Eleven liters of beer, please.

06:29.948 --> 06:33.049
The first round is on me!

06:33.084 --> 06:34.784
And then they pay for themselves!

06:37.455 --> 06:41.724
Oh, do not listen to them, their
pockets are stuffed with back pay.

06:41.759 --> 06:44.827
And they have not seen
a woman in months. Oof.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.095
Ahem.

06:46.096 --> 06:49.365
Here, take this down to the
shop and tell Mister Wong

06:49.400 --> 06:52.968
you want the biggest jar
of coconut butter he's got.

06:53.003 --> 06:56.339
- Why?
- Trust me.

07:06.148 --> 07:07.881
God... Archer!

07:07.917 --> 07:10.884
<i>- What?
- You're "Rojo Tres!"</i>

07:10.920 --> 07:13.253
I thought I was Red Thr... Oh.

07:13.289 --> 07:15.489
- Jesus Christ.
- Shut up, bird.

07:15.490 --> 07:18.058
<i>No, you shut up,
and keep an eye peeled for</i>

07:18.059 --> 07:20.494
<i>- that son of a bitch Ziegler.
- Ja?</i>

07:20.495 --> 07:23.631
- Wha...?!
- He could be anywhere.

07:23.632 --> 07:27.867
Goddamn it, Ziegler, you...

07:28.903 --> 07:31.471
<i>Adios, desayuno.</i>

07:31.506 --> 07:35.041
Ziegleeeer!

07:39.247 --> 07:43.615
Oh, Ziegler.

07:43.651 --> 07:47.320
It means the brickmaker!

07:47.355 --> 07:51.324
Ziegler, this is a family name in German
for someone who makes bricks.

07:51.359 --> 07:53.526
- Mm-hmm...
- But in this case,

07:53.527 --> 07:54.961
it has also another meaning

07:54.962 --> 07:57.663
because he turns the enemy
warplanes into bricks!

07:57.698 --> 07:59.998
Yeah, other languages have puns too.

08:00.033 --> 08:02.100
But not as powerful as German puns!

08:02.135 --> 08:04.169
- Shhh!
- And so, with Ziegler

08:04.204 --> 08:08.039
and the other pilots providing close
air support to the new soldiers,

08:08.075 --> 08:11.243
<i>nothing, not cannibals,
not zose verdammt lizards,</i>

08:11.278 --> 08:13.345

08:13.380 --> 08:15.146
Keep your voice down!

08:15.182 --> 08:17.148
If my father hears you,
he'll cut your balls off!

08:17.184 --> 08:20.285
<i>Ja, right, like your bodyguards, eh?</i>

08:20.320 --> 08:21.888
- No!
- Oh.

08:21.889 --> 08:26.791
But until then, get back in here and
bring me some more... wienerschnitzel.

08:26.826 --> 08:29.660
I, uh, still
need a bit more time...

08:29.696 --> 08:33.163
Still?
Ugh. What is taking so long?

08:33.198 --> 08:36.501
<i>I must, uh, replenish my lebenskraft.</i>

08:36.535 --> 08:37.969
Still, though...

08:37.970 --> 08:41.005
Wait a minute, you're not seeing
someone else, are you?

08:41.039 --> 08:44.441

I was in a biplane!

12:46.645 --> 12:49.951
- He was in a brand-new goddamn 109!
- Still though...

12:49.986 --> 12:52.148
Yeah, but you don't
wanna kill him like this, it's...

12:52.183 --> 12:56.252
- It's chickenshit.
- You're right.

12:56.287 --> 12:59.623
Goddamn it, you're right.
And so...

12:59.624 --> 13:02.325
- I'm sorry for this.
- Sorry for...? Ungh!

13:02.326 --> 13:04.927
Oh, what the shit, man?!

13:04.963 --> 13:07.741
Shut up, bird.

13:10.083 --> 13:11.016
Hey.

13:11.017 --> 13:12.017
<i>Hey, wake up.</i>

13:12.018 --> 13:14.406
C'mon, rise and shine, Fritz.

13:16.590 --> 13:17.590
Waaaghh!

13:17.591 --> 13:19.200
<i>- Jesus, what?!
- Was?!</i>

13:19.235 --> 13:22.094
Easy! Easy!
I'm supposed to give you this.

13:22.095 --> 13:25.097
- How is this bird talking?!
- Right?

13:25.098 --> 13:28.781
<i>Was zum Teufel ist...
Oh, Scheiße!</i>

13:30.004 --> 13:34.138
<i>Nein, nein, nein, nein!
Scheißkopf!</i>

13:40.313 --> 13:44.181
So, hey, what would
a gal have to do to...?

13:44.217 --> 13:47.050
Jesus, rude much?!

13:47.086 --> 13:48.286
I was going to ask how to get

13:48.287 --> 13:50.187
a ride out of here on
one of their planes.

13:50.223 --> 13:52.055
Yeah, I wouldn't hold my breath.

13:52.091 --> 13:54.685
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
be a talking bird.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.808
Huzza... wuzza...

14:12.844 --> 14:15.345
Where the...?
Oh, what the shit?!

14:15.380 --> 14:17.480
Heh, heh.
Hey, sleepyhead.

14:17.515 --> 14:20.950
- Glad you could join us.
- Why the hell am I in a... Owww!

14:20.985 --> 14:23.419
Christ on a bike!
My head kills!

14:23.455 --> 14:26.155
Yeah, mine did too, to be honest.

14:26.190 --> 14:29.694
- Little hairy dog?
- No, I... Wait a minute.

14:29.731 --> 14:31.828
- You hit me!
- I lightly tapped you...

14:31.829 --> 14:34.063
You piece of shit, you hit me!

14:34.098 --> 14:36.198
- Only because you were right!
- What?!

14:36.234 --> 14:38.734
I was gonna shoot Ziegler,
you may not remember this

14:38.770 --> 14:40.353
'cause you have a concussion,

14:40.354 --> 14:41.936
but I was gonna shoot Ziegler,

14:41.972 --> 14:44.072
but you told me that was chickenshit,

14:44.107 --> 14:46.007
and so now we're gonna
settle it up here,

14:46.042 --> 14:49.010
in a dogfight,
in evenly matched planes!

14:49.045 --> 14:51.381
- Man to man!
- And woman!

14:51.382 --> 14:53.181
Well, yeah, I needed a tailgunner, so...

14:53.216 --> 14:55.417
- Goddamn it!
- And so now's probably a good time

14:55.452 --> 14:58.988
- to familiarize yourself with said gun...
- Goddamn it!

14:58.989 --> 15:02.624
'Cause if Crackers did what I told
him to, it won't be long before...

15:02.625 --> 15:05.526
<i>- Archer?!
- Speak of the teufel...</i>

15:05.561 --> 15:06.996
Come on up, Ziegler.

15:06.997 --> 15:09.511
See what it's like to fight
somebody fair and squ...

15:09.546 --> 15:12.033
Say your prayers, Archer!

15:12.068 --> 15:14.702
This time I will put you
down once and for all!

15:14.737 --> 15:16.371
Pam, get your head outta your ass!

15:16.372 --> 15:18.205
- Me?!
- Your one job...

15:18.240 --> 15:20.574
is to shoot things
coming at us from beh...

15:20.610 --> 15:22.610
Oh, shit!

15:25.014 --> 15:27.015
- Son of a...
- What was that?

15:27.016 --> 15:29.650
Nothing.

15:31.220 --> 15:34.455
- I assume this was Sterling?
- Yep, yep, yep.

15:34.456 --> 15:37.055
Mm-hmm.

15:40.229 --> 15:41.696
- Putamierda!
- Goddamn it!

15:41.697 --> 15:43.397
It doesn't matter what you fly,

15:43.432 --> 15:48.067
- Archer, I will always beat you!
- Oh, you couldn't beat...

15:48.102 --> 15:49.470
Hang on, I had something for th...

15:49.471 --> 15:52.138
- Ya wanna save the quips?!
- It was pretty good!

15:52.173 --> 15:57.538
Oh, wait, so's that.

15:57.779 --> 16:00.614
How do ya like that, Ziegler?!

16:00.615 --> 16:03.850
Heh. Who taught you how
to shoot, your husband?

16:03.885 --> 16:05.252
Will you shut up?!

16:05.253 --> 16:06.854
It was pretty good!

16:06.855 --> 16:09.655
All right, Archer, I am
bored with this and with you.

16:09.690 --> 16:11.891
Get ready to die.

16:13.761 --> 16:18.364
Um... okay.

16:18.399 --> 16:20.713
<i>- Was ist Los?!
- Scheiße! Wir sind getroffen!</i>

16:20.748 --> 16:22.068
<i>Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein...</i>

16:23.537 --> 16:26.563
What the...?

16:28.075 --> 16:29.576
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hooo!

16:29.577 --> 16:32.244
Holy shit!

16:32.279 --> 16:34.012
- Did you see that?!
- Yeah, I...

16:34.047 --> 16:35.314
I must've hit his fuel tank!

16:35.315 --> 16:37.315
- Wait, what?
- Whoo-hoo!

16:37.351 --> 16:42.820
Million-to-one shot, but I did it!
I finally beat Ziegler!

16:42.856 --> 16:46.391
- Yeah. Way to go.
- Right?!

16:46.426 --> 16:48.459
But so now what? We can't
go back to the island now,

16:48.495 --> 16:50.561
the krauts are gonna know
this whole thing was you.

16:50.597 --> 16:51.697
You think I didn't think of that?!

16:51.698 --> 16:54.365
Don't worry, I put Crackers on it.

16:54.401 --> 16:57.268
What in ze
hell is going on here?!

16:57.303 --> 17:00.004
Well?!
Someone had better tell me!

17:00.039 --> 17:04.009
Uh, yeah, so I was here, earlier,
and I saw the whole thing,

17:04.010 --> 17:06.511
which was Ziegler and the other guy,

17:06.546 --> 17:10.114
Schnell, who, come to
find out, is his lover...

17:10.148 --> 17:11.549
- Nein!
- Yeah...

17:11.550 --> 17:14.852
So they stole the other two planes
and set this one on fire,

17:14.853 --> 17:18.321
so nobody could follow them to Shanghai,

17:18.357 --> 17:21.058
where they plan to open a cabaret,

17:21.093 --> 17:25.096
the unfortunately named "Scandals."

17:25.097 --> 17:28.263
Ooh, Scandals, that sounds fun, huh?

17:28.300 --> 17:29.867
<i>- Morgen!
- Hallo, Schatz!</i>

17:29.868 --> 17:33.703
- Hi, guys!
- You're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

17:33.739 --> 17:37.174
- I'm surprised you can even walk.
- What? Oh!

17:37.175 --> 17:38.975
God, no, they were all
so drunk they thought

17:39.010 --> 17:42.611
that jar of coconut butter
was, you know, me.

17:42.647 --> 17:44.547
Oh. Oh!

17:44.582 --> 17:47.283
Well, as long as you charged
everybody full price...

17:47.319 --> 17:48.652
Heh. Right?

17:48.653 --> 17:51.187
Then you should have
a lot of money to give me?

17:51.222 --> 17:53.823
Ah. About that...

17:53.858 --> 17:57.126
I've decided that from now
on, I'm keeping all of it.

17:57.162 --> 17:59.362
- Excuse me?!
- Yeah, because your cop buddy

17:59.363 --> 18:00.697
lives in a barrel now,

18:00.698 --> 18:03.333
and this stupid island is
under an occupying power,

18:03.334 --> 18:04.634
all of whom are heavily armed

18:04.635 --> 18:08.003
and basically totally in love with me.

18:08.038 --> 18:09.639
<i>Für dich, Fraülein!</i>

18:09.640 --> 18:12.140
Awww!

18:13.911 --> 18:18.246
So go make me some
goddamn breakfast.

18:18.282 --> 18:20.648
Besides, getting
back to the island is like,

18:20.684 --> 18:22.550
the one thing we don't
have to worry about.

18:22.586 --> 18:25.153
Yeah exactly, so...
Wait, what?!

18:27.557 --> 18:29.993
Damn it.
Well, the good news is,

18:29.994 --> 18:31.860
at least it's a seaplane, right?

18:31.895 --> 18:34.396
- Well, I mean, it was...
- What?!

18:34.397 --> 18:37.766
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it! If you...

18:37.767 --> 18:39.434
Oh, shut up!
C'mon, if anybody

18:39.435 --> 18:42.003
can crash-land a plane,
it's me, right? Huh?

18:42.038 --> 18:44.405
With all my experience?
Pam?

18:44.440 --> 18:48.655
- Then get it over with!
- Oh, okay, I guess just pout.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.578
- Pam.
- I am!

18:50.579 --> 18:52.346
Okay, then here goes!

19:01.891 --> 19:04.091
Whooo-hoo-hoo!

19:04.127 --> 19:05.192
<i>Bocadas De mierda!</i>

19:05.193 --> 19:09.362
And did you see that, Pam?!
Also perfect!

19:09.398 --> 19:11.532
Who wins? Huh?
Archer wins!

19:11.567 --> 19:14.067
Yeah? This is a win for you?

19:14.102 --> 19:17.337
Not just for me, Pam.
For America.

19:18.340 --> 19:21.341
And those hapless Spanish communists.

19:22.644 --> 19:27.647
- Well? So now what?!
- So now, since we've only got one flare,

19:27.682 --> 19:29.182
I'm gonna shoot their leader with it,

19:29.183 --> 19:31.684
and then when the rest of
them go into a feeding frenzy,

19:31.719 --> 19:33.353
you and me are gonna make a run for it.

19:33.354 --> 19:35.688
- What?!
- I'm kidding!

19:35.723 --> 19:38.891
You big dumb idiot.

19:38.927 --> 19:41.561
Ya know...
