[ Booth ]
It’s clear as a photograph.
You o’on ’2‘ see anything in the cheese?

00:06.632 --> 00:11.422
Nothing. You don ’t see anything?
Seeing patterns where none exist
is a symptom of schizophrenia.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.130
- Why? What do you see?
- Michael Jackson doing his—

00:16.434 --> 00:18.675
I don’t know
what that is.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.976
Come on,
you don’t see anything?
It’s like when a kid,

00:21.105 --> 00:24.097
he looks up at the sky
and he sees the clouds—
Oh, I get it.

00:24.192 --> 00:27.810
Yes. Your mind forms patterns
from random information.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.529
Um, Booth,
I have a lot of work.
Right.

00:31.616 --> 00:34.779
No. |-| just wanted
to bring by the pizza
so you could eat.

00:42.418 --> 00:46.707
Nothing? Come on, King of Pop.
This Is It. Thriller. No?

00:46.797 --> 00:49.288
All right,
I’ll see you Monday.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.416
Bye, Booth.
Yep.

00:55.306 --> 00:58.013
Strange question, I know,
but I got to ask.

00:58.142 --> 01:00.804
Are you, by any chance,
pregnant?
No.

in quite some time.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.725
Do you want to know
why I’m asking?

01:05.816 --> 01:08.353
You’re holding
a home pregnancy test.
/ assume it’s positive,

01:08.444 --> 01:11.561
and you’re worried about
losing the most important
person in this lab.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.568
No. Very modest.

01:14.659 --> 01:18.743
Uh, I’m asking because
Michelle was here earlier
this afternoon...

01:18.829 --> 01:20.740
and the only other two people,

01:20.831 --> 01:24.039
besides me that
use that bathroom
are you and Angela.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.617
- Well, Angela is currently
sexually active.
- Very true.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.623
- With Wendell.
- Very, very active.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.000
And even if they use condoms,
Wendell is young.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.048
His sperm is likely to be
extremely motile.

01:33.135 --> 01:36.127
You are so cheering me up
right now.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.223
Dr. Saroyan, l was hoping
I could pick up...

01:41.352 --> 01:45.140
those strength deployment
inventory results from you.
Oh.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.059
You didn’t
hand them out.
l was going to.

01:47.149 --> 01:51.483
But there was... real work
that needed doing.
Next week for sure.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.482
Okay, but these
aptitude tests will help you
as an administrator...

01:54.573 --> 01:57.189
to put the right people
in key positions to—
You’re not listening to me.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.492
No offense intended.

02:02.999 --> 02:05.536
Angela, quick question.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.164
Uh, is this your
home pregnancy test?

[ Chuckles ]
I beg your pardon?

Please say yes.

Oh.
Hey, don’t look at me.

02:20.766 --> 02:24.725
I’m so sorry.
I thought we were alone.

don’t have to keep it
a secret from me.

Wait a minute,
Wh y are you asking me ?

02:35.406 --> 02:39.319
Well, it isn’t mine,
and Dr. Brennan
doesn’t make life choices...

02:39.410 --> 02:43.528
without a Boolean flowchart,
so I hoped it might be you.

I’m not... crazy.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.207
- Yeah, well,
what makes Cam crazy?
- When I do experiments.

- And?
- Michelle?

03:43.349 --> 03:46.637
Ah, Dr. Brennan.
Hello.

03:47.728 --> 03:51.437
Your government requires you
to figure out...

03:53.275 --> 03:55.186
how this person died.

03:56.862 --> 04:00.150
Until you do, we’re all
locked in here together...

of national security.

No one in, no one out—
by order of the federal

04:09.166 --> 04:12.329
Now, you have
till dawn tomorrow
to fulfill this task.

04:12.420 --> 04:16.789
What pOSSIb/e incentive
do these people have
to comply with your orders ?

04:16.882 --> 04:19.339
Perhaps the fact
that you’re all paid
by the federal government?

04:19.468 --> 04:21.845
Threats are not really
gonna work for you tonight.
Okay, fine.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.046
How about patriotism?
Professionalism?

04:25.141 --> 04:27.382
Scientific curiosity?
Take your pick.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.388
But the sooner you people figure
out what killed this individual,

04:30.479 --> 04:32.470
the sooner life
gets back to normal.

[Whispering ] I’m at the lab.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.896
Why are you whispering?
Bunch of government guys
came in.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.233
They sealed the place up.
They brought in a body.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.239
They won’t let anyone
come or leave.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.571
Slow-Slow down.
What government guys?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.452
They said they’re from
the General Services
Administration.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.042
Uh, whoa.
They’re supposed to be
in charge of promoting...

05:37.129 --> 05:40.462
efficient government operations,
like leasing office space
and buying paper in bulk.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.460
- It doesn’t make any sense.
- Who else is there?

05:42.551 --> 05:45.167
Uh, Drs. Brennan,
Saroyan, Hodgins,

05:45.304 --> 05:48.592

So they knew to come when the techs
were gone for the weekend.

I’ll look into it.

must not be harmed.

at each other,

12:44.514 --> 12:46.470
but they’re ready to
respond as a unit easily.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.469
They’ve either been
partnered up for years...

12:48.560 --> 12:51.222
or they’ve been through
some pretty hairy situations
together.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.224
Right. Right.
So it’s an active unit.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.226
Also, they don’t
respect Mr. White.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.649
When he’s not looking,
they flick their eyes
toward each other.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.939
Right, they don’t like
working for him.
Yes. Exactly.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.897
But they treat
the body on the gurney
with great deference.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.698
- Fallen comrade.
- That was my first thought.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.402
Attaboy, Sweets.
Attaboy.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.493
[Beeps]

13:15.128 --> 13:17.119
[Door Closes ]

13:24.179 --> 13:27.717
Who do you think
we’ve got here—
Jimmy Hoffa?

13:27.808 --> 13:30.515
Here, another cloth fiber.

13:30.644 --> 13:35.388
Wool.
It could be, like,
D.B. Cooper, that hijacker.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.768
We’re not supposed
to conjecture about
the identity of the victim.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.770
No, we’re not supposed
to in vest/gate.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.318
This is America, baby.
We can conjecture all we want.

13:42.406 --> 13:46.024
He does has a good brow line
and nice, strong jaw.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.824
I mean, whoever he was
he was good-looking.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.368
You should do a reconstruction.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.367
Hair— it’s probably human.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.832
Don’t you think they’re
gonna know what I’m doing?
So what?

13:55.919 --> 13:59.912
Just tell them we need
to see what the victim’s skull
looked like before the damage.

14:17.315 --> 14:22.480
Did you find anything?
The victim died within months
of the Limited Test Ban Treaty.

14:22.571 --> 14:25.153
[Voice Quavering ]
That was in 1963.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.447
You look like you’re
about to explode.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.744
Is there, by any chance,

14:36.835 --> 14:41.249
a nick on the right rib
somewhere near the third
thoracic vertebra?

14:41.381 --> 14:45.795
Yes. Uh, most likely caused
by a transiting bullet.
[ Sighs ]

14:45.886 --> 14:48.548
Hodgins, you’re vibrating.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.965
- [Typing ]
- One of the fiber samples...

14:53.060 --> 14:55.597
turned out to be
pink wool.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.598
The bad back.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.146
A nick from
a transiting bullet.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.403
1963.

15:06.490 --> 15:10.028
Wait. Pink wool,
as in Chanel?

15:11.119 --> 15:13.110
She never left his side.

15:13.205 --> 15:16.117
Severe head wound

15:16.208 --> 15:18.699
Oh, my God.

15:18.794 --> 15:22.457
This... is President
John F. Kennedy.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.340
Why would they
bring us J.F.K.’s remains
after all these years?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.516
Because people have a thirst
for the truth.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.811
And other people want
to make sure that truth
is never proclaimed.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.480
- Which are these?
- [Brennan] Well,
l’ve been considering—

15:42.567 --> 15:44.979
in what kind of casket
was the president buried?

15:45.070 --> 15:47.106
- Mahogany.
- That’s a good casket.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.984
How could his remains
be completely skeletonized?

15:50.075 --> 15:53.659
If the casket was compromised
and allowed in oxygen
and moisture,

15:53.745 --> 15:56.157
skeletonization
could have occurred.

15:56.289 --> 16:01.033
That’s naive of us to imagine
that Kennedy’s remains were ever
actually interred at Arlington.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.962
The hair / found?
No cuticle or cortex.
lt’s synthetic.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.630
As it happens,
after J.F.K. was shot,

16:07.717 --> 16:11.175
the funeral home
tried a cosmetic fix
with wig hair, wax...

16:11.263 --> 16:13.345
and a metal mesh
holding it in place.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.558
Ahh.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.510
The mesh would explain
the crisscross patterns
in the skull.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.850
I can’t confront Michelle
about something this big
over the telephone, right?

16:26.987 --> 16:31.151
The fact that you may be
investigating the murder
of the president of the United States?

16:31.283 --> 16:32.443
[ Knocks ]
[ Beeping ]

16:32.534 --> 16:34.195
No. The fact
that she’s pregnant.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.080
Oh!

16:41.168 --> 16:43.409
- Booth.
- Hiya, Bones.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.122
[Agent Grunts]

16:49.217 --> 16:51.048
Booth?

16:52.095 --> 16:55.633
- Bones?
- [ Sighs ]

16:58.602 --> 17:03.392
You all right?
Yeah. I can tell you those
are a couple of big guys.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.972
[ Exhales ]
Did you figure out
who the dead guy is yet?

17:06.067 --> 17:09.605
Hodgins and Cam are convinced
that it’s John F. Kennedy.

17:09.696 --> 17:13.063
The 35th president
of the United States...

17:13.158 --> 17:16.025
who was assassinated
on November 22, 1963.

17:16.161 --> 17:20.120
I know who J.F.K. is.
Also, Cam is certain
that Michelle is pregnant.

17:20.207 --> 17:25.952
Usually, that would be big news,
but right now it’s not so much.
It’s J.F.K.?

17:26.046 --> 17:28.879
Wait. Was Hodgins the first
to say that it was J.F.K.?

17:28.965 --> 17:30.876
Yes.
Then it’s not J.F.K

17:30.967 --> 17:34.505
- Hodgins is
an excellent scientist.
- Hey, hey, Mr. White.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.679
- How’d you get past the guards?
- Uh, sniper training.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.223
They trained me how to walk
really, really quietly.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.926
You’re now restricted
to the building, of course.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.808
Damn.
Who saw that coming?

18:00.330 --> 18:02.321
Awkwa rd. Awkwa rd.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.948
Very awkward.
What’s awkward?

18:05.085 --> 18:07.701
About Michelle.
Oh, I’m gonna call her
right now...

18:07.796 --> 18:11.380
and tell her that
I need to talk to her
as soon as | get out of here.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.624
About-About
the pregnancy test?
She lied to me.

18:13.760 --> 18:18.174
She told me to my face
that she wasn’t having sex
with that boy. She lied to my face.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.006
It’s my pregnancy test.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.643
I’m-I’m sorry, Cam.
I-I would have told you sooner,

18:25.730 --> 18:27.595
but Hodgins
was in the room and—

18:27.732 --> 18:32.351
Oh, thank God.
No, I mean—
lt’s okay. [ Chuckles ]

18:32.487 --> 18:34.318
You all right?
Um...

18:34.406 --> 18:37.022
I’m a—
I’m a bit in shock.

18:37.117 --> 18:41.451
- Does Wendell know?
- No. [Chuckles]
No. No, only you and I know.

18:41.538 --> 18:44.450
And, I mean, really,
shouldn’t Wendell be
the first to know?

18:44.541 --> 18:47.283
But I figured that you—
you need to know.

18:47.377 --> 18:51.245
- Because I was freaking out
about Michelle. Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.310
Any luck finding out
what’s going on?

19:11.401 --> 19:13.312
Nobody knows anything.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.689
Whatever this is,
it’s locked down pretty tight.
Any idea who these guys are?

19:15.780 --> 19:18.647
[ Booth ] Oh, they took me down
in classic Secret Service
protocol.

19:20.952 --> 19:25.821
Don’t tell any Reagan jokes or
mention the Bush shoe incident.
They get really mad.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.826
Right. You have any contacts
inside the White House?

19:27.917 --> 19:30.909
Of course I do. I’m extremely
well connected. I’m insulted
you even asked that question.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.915
Do I have any contacts
in the White House?

19:33.006 --> 19:35.042
Great.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.928
Oh.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.400
Wow.
[Angela] So Wendell
should be the first to know.

19:55.487 --> 19:59.605
But you should be the second,
and since I told Cam,
I-I-I should tell you.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.031
Do I say congratulations?

20:02.118 --> 20:04.074
I don’t know.
[ Chuckles ]

20:04.162 --> 20:06.369
I mean,
it’s not the right time.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.831
lt’s not the right guy.
Well, you know,
Wendell, uh, he—

20:09.959 --> 20:14.373
He might rise to the occasion.
He’s a good guy.
No, I didn’t mean that. I mean—

20:14.464 --> 20:19.754
A baby, I mean,
you’re linked to that person
for the rest of your life.

20:19.844 --> 20:24.713
Like way more than if you’re
married. I mean, you’re linked
through another human being.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.969
A soul.

20:31.064 --> 20:35.728
Okay, I’m— I’m gonna say
congratulations.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.401
Um... not for today,

20:38.488 --> 20:40.854
but for how you’re gonna
feel about this later on.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.191
Well, I might not
even keep it.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.653
You’re gonna keep it, Angela.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.284
You always wanted kids.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.457
Lots of them.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.581
[ Beep/ng ]

20:57.966 --> 20:59.957
I’m gonna go get the others.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.169
Okay.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.841
[ Booth ]
That is not J. F. K

21:08.935 --> 21:12.223
Kennedy was on steroids
to treat Addison’s Disease.

21:12.313 --> 21:13.928
That’s what wrecked his back
and adrenals.

21:14.023 --> 21:17.060
[ Saroyan ] That would create
a more Cushingoid appearance.

21:17.152 --> 21:20.110
You are not permitted
to identify the victim.

21:20.196 --> 21:24.235
In order to recreate
what happened to the skull,
we need to encase it in flesh.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.281
it’s totally nondescr/pt,
as you can see.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.576
You know
who I kinda see?

21:28.705 --> 21:31.287
Ricky Martin.
Alex Trebek.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.786
- [ Saroyan ] James Garner.
- I see Booth.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.789
- You think that looks like me?
- Yes, I do.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.041
I’ll be in the bone room
looking at the actual skull.

21:42.510 --> 21:45.627
Hey, so, if it was J.F.K.,

21:45.722 --> 21:48.134
Angela’s facial reconstruction
would have shown us this,
right?

21:48.224 --> 21:50.966
Facial reconstructions
are not photographs, Booth.

21:51.060 --> 21:54.268
There’s a wide latitude
for interpretation.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.641
There, this could be
the point of entry.

21:56.733 --> 22:00.351
The semicircle is beveled.
Wider on the inside
than on the outside.

22:00.487 --> 22:05.652
That was the entry?
If— If the victim was
shot from the rear, yes.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.654
The beveling is usually
like an arrow pointing
towards the shooter.

22:08.745 --> 22:12.283
As to the exit,
we’re missing
some skull fragments.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.326
Maybe they were held back
on purpose?
Possibly.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.658
But it’s much more likely
that they were pulverized...

22:16.753 --> 22:18.994
and scattered
by the bullet impact.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.125
Forensic techniques
in the early 603 were
relatively primitive.

22:22.217 --> 22:25.584
Check above the right temple
on the skull
or a fragment from there.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.215
Huh. So suddenly
you’re an expert
in ballistics forensics?

22:28.306 --> 22:30.217
That’s where
J.F.K.’s exit wound was.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.344
Why do you know so much about
the Kennedy assassination?

22:32.435 --> 22:35.051
Bones, I’m a trained sniper.
How quickly you forget.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.182
Oh, well, you were
right about the exit.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.434
Whew. Right. Well, it doesn’t
mean it’s the president.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.853
People get shot in the head
all the time, right?
That’s true.

22:41.945 --> 22:46.154
Perhaps Angela can recreate
the situation under which
this wound occurred.

22:46.241 --> 22:50.234
Or she could
recreate J.F.K.’s shooting
so we can rule him out, right?

22:50.328 --> 22:53.070
Oh.
Yeah.

22:53.164 --> 22:57.077
I requested this animation
from the Justice Department.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.786
I found a right rear entry
with an exit in the right
parietal region.

23:00.922 --> 23:03.334
Kennedy wounds
exacﬂy.
Right.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.291
So his head went back
and to the left.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.048
Look, heads do
all sorts of crazy things
when you shoot ’em.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.881
Since this was based
on the official record,
we can’t believe it.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.967
Here we go.

23:15.061 --> 23:19.054
You think there’s no way
the president of the United
States gets murdered...

23:19.148 --> 23:22.561
in public in broad daylight
and-and the truth
gets co vered up ?

23:22.652 --> 23:24.643
That’s right.
It doesn’t happen.
This is America.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.321
The highest form of patriotism
is to be skeptical
of the official truth.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.990
That is why the First Amendment,
free speech,

23:31.077 --> 23:34.069
is first in the Constitution
you would die to protect.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.778
The lone gunman version
is impossible.

23:35.873 --> 23:39.866
The guy in front,
John Connally, gets shot
1.6 seconds after Kennedy.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.870
It’s a piece of cake.
With a World War II
Italian rifle...

23:42.964 --> 23:45.296
that was older
than Lee Harvey Oswald?
Come on.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.624
I’m sorry, but have you
ever shot a rifle?

23:47.760 --> 23:51.719
If I had one of those guns right
now, I’d show you right now.
You’re on.

23:51.806 --> 23:53.888
No one is allowed
to leave the Jeffersonian.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.931
No, we don’t have to leave.

23:56.019 --> 24:00.308
I know exactly where to find
an exact replica of the rifle
here at the Jeffersonian.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.855
Great.

24:15.705 --> 24:19.789
[Sweets] Lee Harvey Oswald’s
rifle is in the Jefferson/an ?
No. No.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.243
But the FBI.
used an exact replica to
recreate the assassination.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.249
We’ve got that
down in storage.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.706
They said we have to
stay in the lab area.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.882
The janitor’s closet
is in the lab area.
All right.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.632
A couple of years ago, right,
I check out the claims of
this conspiracy group...

24:33.723 --> 24:36.260
that says that the Jeffersonian
was a Masonic construction.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.262
They said that there
was a passageway.

24:38.353 --> 24:41.641
Well, it turns out to be true.
Check this out.

24:41.731 --> 24:45.599
There’s a fake wall
in the janitor’s closet,
covers a ladder.

24:45.693 --> 24:49.402
So, what? We just
sneak in one by one,
hope they don ’t see us ?

24:49.489 --> 24:52.071
- Yeah. You got a better idea?
- [Booth ] Sounds good to me.

25:33.574 --> 25:37.817
So I, uh, used the fact
that, uh, Mr. White was
eavesdropping on us...

25:37.954 --> 25:41.367
to sow the seeds
of discord.
What?

25:41.457 --> 25:47.373
You know, I lodged in his
subconscious that his men
don’t respect him.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.421
Sweets, these guys are pros.
You didn’t lodge anything
or sow any seeds.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.842
[ Exhales ]
Wow. Hope Hodgins’s map
is accurate.

25:58.933 --> 26:02.300
Okay, so the J.F.K. investigation
stuff is over there.

26:06.190 --> 26:10.399
Okay, I’m gonna say something
that’s gonna make you think
that I’m as paranoid as Hodgins.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.351
Okay.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.945
This feels
like a test to me.
Who’s being tested?

Yeah. Maybe even me.

more specific. Is that it?

There it is.
Is that the actual weapon?

26:34.677 --> 26:38.386
No, it’s a perfect replica

Perhaps the most hated weapon
in United States history.

6.5 millimeters.

This is what we do.

28:00.304 --> 28:03.637
And this experiment is
essential to cause of death?

28:03.724 --> 28:06.511
Because you
have forbidden us
from taking samples...

How fast is that?
Ten, 11 miles per hour.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.194
Okay, so,

29:08.289 --> 29:12.373

it’ll be the correct speed,

Case closed.
Oswald could have
made the shot.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.143
Booth, Oswald was a lousy shot.
You’re one of the best.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.940
Yeah, lhate to adm/t this,
Booth, but Hodgins is making
a pretty good point.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.026
All he’s proving is
he made up his mind.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.203

We just proved that.

30:36.627 --> 30:41.041
If you look closer,
there are microfractures
radiating from the exit wound,

it wasn’t an exit
but an entrance.

different angle,

there was a second gunman.

31:10.786 --> 31:14.495
Two shooters. You know
what that proves to me?

31:14.582 --> 31:16.493
Only that there
were two shooters.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.791
No, that those remains
are not John F. Kennedy.

Why is it so important
to you that this not be
President Kennedy?

31:26.302 --> 31:30.887
If it was him,
he was killed by two gunmen.
Yes.

31:31.015 --> 31:34.678
And if he was killed by two gunmen,
then the government lied.
They covered it up.

Throughout history, governments
have lied with impunity...

31:37.313 --> 31:40.555

and to their own citizens.

31:40.649 --> 31:43.061

this have anything to do
with the fact...

34:15.262 --> 34:18.470

39:40.087 --> 39:43.124
Yeah, but
the victim turned out
not to be Kennedy.

39:43.215 --> 39:46.799
What if the only part of Kennedy
that wasn’t Kennedy
was that floating arm bone?

39:46.885 --> 39:49.547
Maybe I was being tested,
you know,

39:49.638 --> 39:52.550
- after my brain surgery.
- Or me.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.552
Come on, guys, if they were
testing anybody, it’s me.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.554
They think I’m a paranoid
conspiracy theorist.

39:56.645 --> 40:01.309
Maybe they were testing me
to see if I could run a lab
in a professional manner.

40:01.400 --> 40:05.484
Well, you do realize that—
all these tests—
everybody failed.

40:05.571 --> 40:09.484
Not me.
I-I figured out the truth.

40:12.077 --> 40:15.695
There’s a congressional
committee suggesting
that Kennedy be exhumed.

40:15.789 --> 40:18.201
[ Saroyan ]
You mean, we were
some sort of dry run ?

40:18.292 --> 40:20.874
And that’s why we couldn’t
mark the bones.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.997
Except they weren’t
Kennedy’s bones.

40:26.508 --> 40:30.296
No, they weren’t
Kennedy’s bones.

40:37.853 --> 40:40.219
So, can I get you a cab?

40:41.398 --> 40:43.354
I’m not pregnant.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.855
It was a false positive.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.020
[Chuckles]

40:50.115 --> 40:55.235
Oh. Well, that must be
a big relief.

40:55.370 --> 40:58.032
Yeah.
Everything
goes back to normal.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.114
How it was before.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.915
Yeah. Yeah, but, um,

41:03.045 --> 41:06.629
l-l want to—
I want to thank you for—
No. Hey.

41:06.715 --> 41:09.252
Forget it.

41:09.343 --> 41:11.629
I’ll never forget it.

41:29.029 --> 41:33.648
Were you aware that J.F.K.
had scarlet fever in childhood?

41:33.742 --> 41:36.654
Hodgins informed me
of that fact, yes.

41:36.745 --> 41:39.862
Scarlet fever
can cause osteomylitis.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.867
It’s very rare.

41:41.958 --> 41:46.668
It can— It can happen
in approximately
one in a hundred cases.

41:46.755 --> 41:49.462
It’s statistically unlikely
that it was Kennedy.

41:52.469 --> 41:54.460
You’re a good person.

41:56.390 --> 41:59.382
I will never forget
what you did for him.

42:02.521 --> 42:05.979
Ooh. I’m oddly energized.

42:06.066 --> 42:09.479
I-I-I should be exhausted,
physically and emotionally,

42:09.569 --> 42:11.730
but l-l feel like
I could work all day.

42:11.822 --> 42:15.360
Right. You should get home
and get to sleep before
you fall over, okay, Sweets?

42:15.450 --> 42:17.361
- Okay.
- Yeah, head to the pillow.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.363
I forgot where
I parked my car.
Shall we?

42:19.454 --> 42:21.536
[Chuckles]
We shall.

42:21.623 --> 42:26.333
You know, you must think
I’m crazy for being so happy
that it wasn’t J.F.K.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.331
I’m very impressed.

42:28.422 --> 42:31.630
You wanted the truth, even
if it was going to hurt you.

42:31.717 --> 42:34.299
I learned that from you.

42:34.428 --> 42:37.545
Really?
Yeah.

42:37.639 --> 42:41.723
I mean, sometimes you
have to go with your brain
over your gut.

42:42.769 --> 42:44.680
That’s nice.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.262
But I’d prefer that you
always go with your brain
over your gut.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.097
Because your gut cannot think.

42:49.192 --> 42:51.399
Your brain can’t digest
a breakfast burrito.

42:51.528 --> 42:54.144
Just the same.
To each their own.
[ Chuckles ]

42:54.239 --> 42:56.321
To each their own.
Yep.

42:56.408 --> 42:59.741
[No Audible Dialogue]

43:38.825 --> 43:40.201
What’s that mean?
