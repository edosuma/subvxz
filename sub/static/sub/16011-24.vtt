01:53.240 --> 01:54.600
[sobbing and sniffing]

01:59.080 --> 02:00.480
[Vincent snores]

02:14.960 --> 02:16.720
Hey, how about this film now?

02:16.760 --> 02:17.760
It's exactly the same,

02:17.761 --> 02:18.761
except with martial arts.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.920
If you touch this movie

02:19.921 --> 02:21.040
before it's over,

02:21.080 --> 02:22.480
I'm gonna dump water on every

02:22.481 --> 02:23.880
single computer in this place.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.160
[blows]

02:29.800 --> 02:31.000
That's totally

02:31.001 --> 02:32.200
what a real prince would do.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.360
Once Mo told me that...

02:34.400 --> 02:35.720
Who's Mo?

02:35.760 --> 02:38.640
Um, just someone I sort of know.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.520
Does he go to school here?

02:40.560 --> 02:41.960
Not really.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.420
Hey... is there

02:43.421 --> 02:44.840
any more popcorn?

02:48.120 --> 02:49.640
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:49.680 --> 02:51.336
- I swear,
- it wasn't on purpose, alright?

02:51.360 --> 02:52.400
I'll fix it.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.560
Awww!

02:55.720 --> 02:56.880
Don't worry.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.240
I know how to fix things.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.200
Does Mo?

03:09.560 --> 03:11.440
The bathroom is back here?

03:11.480 --> 03:13.160
Yeah, if you have a really loose

03:13.161 --> 03:14.840
definition of "bathroom".

03:32.120 --> 03:33.200
- You've gotta be kidding!

03:33.201 --> 03:34.280
- What?

03:34.320 --> 03:35.640
You've got a thing

03:35.641 --> 03:36.960
for that Mo guy!

03:37.000 --> 03:38.320
I do not!

03:38.360 --> 03:39.420
He's a character

03:39.421 --> 03:40.480
in a fairy tale!

03:40.520 --> 03:42.520
Yeah, out here he is.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.560
But in here, he's real!

03:44.600 --> 03:46.360
And he's dashing,

03:46.361 --> 03:48.120
and smart, and funny...

03:48.160 --> 03:49.380
and I totally

03:49.381 --> 03:50.600
don't have a thing for him.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.560
[Paula] For who? This "Mo" guy?

03:55.160 --> 03:57.320
Tell me everything about him!

03:57.360 --> 03:58.880
Come on! Spill!

04:00.040 --> 04:01.520
[Mia] Well,

04:01.560 --> 04:02.920
he's sort of a prince.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.120
Ooow! Good start!

04:05.160 --> 04:07.920
And he... protects animals.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.720
Like an activist?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.360
Yeah, sort of.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.720
And he's really into flying.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.760
And everyone looks up to him.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.040
[sighs]

04:17.079 --> 04:19.360
And he's tall and strong and...

04:19.399 --> 04:20.640
Imaginary.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.620
Why don't we go outside

04:24.621 --> 04:25.880
and you can tell me more?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.200
Okay.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.960
- But I don't have a thing
- for him!

04:35.080 --> 04:36.820
Okay, Vincent is

04:36.821 --> 04:38.560
totally jealous.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.760
[Mia] WHAAT?!

04:39.800 --> 04:41.520
[Paula] You don't see it?

04:41.560 --> 04:43.220
Every time you mention

04:43.221 --> 04:44.880
this "Mo" guy

04:44.920 --> 04:46.200
his hair practically

04:46.201 --> 04:47.480
catches fire.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.920
[Mia] That's ridiculous.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.520
Vincent is just a friend.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.040
And so is Mo!

04:52.080 --> 04:53.480
Are you sure about that?

04:53.520 --> 04:54.800
[Mia] Which?

04:54.840 --> 04:56.160
[Paula] Take your pick.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.820
Um, listen I need to talk

05:00.821 --> 05:02.200
to Vincent alone for a while.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.640
Yeaah... I bet you do.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.280
No, not like that. I just...

05:06.320 --> 05:08.160
okay, whatever. I'll be back.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.480
Mo calling?

05:18.520 --> 05:19.560
There's more to Centopia

05:19.600 --> 05:20.800
than just Mo.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.200
I'll be right back.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.520
Hi Mia. Say your password.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.680
"Where merry elves

05:41.681 --> 05:42.800
can swim and play,

05:42.840 --> 05:44.640
until it opens it will stay."

05:57.000 --> 06:00.520
[screams]

06:03.560 --> 06:05.160
Aaaww!

06:07.720 --> 06:10.360
Sorry. Don't mind me.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.440
[snorts]

06:12.480 --> 06:13.820
Your appearance is

06:13.821 --> 06:15.160
always welcome, Mia.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.280
Startling, but welcome.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.320
You get used to

06:19.321 --> 06:21.320
the "startling" part. [chuckles]

06:21.360 --> 06:23.020
Whoa. Didn't most of that

06:23.021 --> 06:24.680
used to be green?

06:24.720 --> 06:25.900
[Mayla] The Great Jungle is

06:25.901 --> 06:27.080
all dried up.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.760
The Sparkle Pollen

06:28.761 --> 06:30.400
Fields, parched.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.360
- [Mia] Pretty soon
- there'll be nothing left!

06:32.400 --> 06:34.320
Phuddle is on the case!

06:34.360 --> 06:35.520
Majesties!

06:35.521 --> 06:36.680
Good news!

06:36.720 --> 06:38.040
The trumptus is

06:38.041 --> 06:39.360
almost assembled!

06:39.400 --> 06:41.280
Only two pieces still missing!

06:41.320 --> 06:42.480
Okay, so let's get on

06:42.481 --> 06:43.640
finding them!

06:43.680 --> 06:45.720
Mia, hit us with the oracle.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.100
"Where merry elves

06:47.101 --> 06:48.440
can swim and play,

06:48.480 --> 06:50.880
until it opens it will stay."

06:50.920 --> 06:53.360
- We used to swim all up and down
- the Rialto River.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.600
Could that be it?

06:54.640 --> 06:56.440
That's a lot of ground to cover.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.160
[Phuddle] Ooh, here,

06:58.200 --> 06:59.920
this'll come in handy!

06:59.960 --> 07:01.680
It's a spyglass!

07:01.720 --> 07:03.180
Ten times more magnification

07:03.181 --> 07:04.640
than my last one.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.160
Also three times less likely

07:06.161 --> 07:07.640
to scratch your eye!

07:07.680 --> 07:09.400
Aah! He he.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.360
Thanks. I guess.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.800
C'mon, let's go check out

07:13.801 --> 07:15.200
our old swimming hole.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.560
Good luck, young elves!

07:34.320 --> 07:36.920
Not enough to drown an ant.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.140
Well, at least we have our food

07:39.141 --> 07:41.320
stores, safely protected.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.240
But no new crops growing, sire.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.400
Panthea is strangling our land.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.800
We need help!

07:48.840 --> 07:51.600
From whom? The unicorns?

07:51.640 --> 07:54.240
Panthea has driven them away.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.240
What about the elves, majesty?

07:57.280 --> 07:58.360
Ooohh...

07:58.400 --> 08:00.120
It is our duty as Pans

08:00.160 --> 08:02.160
to remain unseen!

08:02.200 --> 08:03.820
Hidden from the eyes

08:03.821 --> 08:05.440
of the elves and all others!

08:05.480 --> 08:07.000
Ethereal mysteries

08:07.001 --> 08:08.520
of the forest!

08:09.400 --> 08:10.440
[wind whistles]

08:12.680 --> 08:13.720
Oh...

08:20.960 --> 08:23.400
Which way to the elf palace?

08:23.440 --> 08:25.140
I believe it's time

08:25.141 --> 08:26.840
for the Pans to put aside

08:26.880 --> 08:29.240
centuries of shyness.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.400
Woohoo!

08:30.440 --> 08:31.880
Pans are stepping out!

08:31.920 --> 08:33.960
About time!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.440
Some put it aside

08:35.441 --> 08:36.880
faster than others.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.100
[Mo] Wow, from up here

08:40.101 --> 08:41.120
you can really see

08:41.159 --> 08:42.760
- the damage
- Panthea has done!

08:42.799 --> 08:44.240
This used to be

08:44.241 --> 08:45.680
the thickest part of the forest.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.440
[Mia] OH...

08:54.800 --> 08:56.720
You guys used to swim here?

08:56.760 --> 08:58.680
This was our favourite spot.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.800
- I hope it's where
- the oracle's talking about.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.040
Hey, Mo.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.560
Remember how we'd swing across?

09:03.600 --> 09:04.800
[laughs]

09:04.840 --> 09:05.880
Woohoo!

09:05.920 --> 09:07.280
Woo oh!

09:08.760 --> 09:10.440
- Guess we're not doing
- that again.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.880
Wow, clam central.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.840
[neighs]

09:16.880 --> 09:18.760
- The trumptus piece?
- [snorts]

09:18.800 --> 09:20.760
- We definitely guessed
- the place alright.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.760
- He just doesn't know exactly
- where it is.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.520
[neighs]

09:27.560 --> 09:29.160
[gasps] Unicorns!

09:29.200 --> 09:30.380
We haven't seen

09:30.381 --> 09:31.560
a herd in forever!

09:33.800 --> 09:36.120
[neighing]

09:37.960 --> 09:39.300
[Mia] There's no water left

09:39.301 --> 09:40.640
for them to drink!

09:40.680 --> 09:42.240
Poor things!

09:42.280 --> 09:43.440
[neighs]

09:55.000 --> 09:57.040
Wait! Don't go!

09:58.680 --> 10:00.240
Are you nuts?

10:00.280 --> 10:02.000
- We can't use up all
- our water glares!

10:02.040 --> 10:03.320
We'll be defenseless!

10:04.840 --> 10:06.060
We can't just let them

10:06.061 --> 10:07.280
go thirsty, Mo.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.920
[sighs]

10:12.921 --> 10:13.960
Come here, Yuko.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.360
Help out with this.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.640
- I'm out.
- Me too.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.840
We better fan out and

10:26.841 --> 10:28.000
find that Trumptus piece.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.440
- [Yuko] I don't wanna be out here
- unarmed any longer

10:30.480 --> 10:31.600
Than we have to.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.280
[clears throat]

10:39.200 --> 10:40.840
Never before has the King

10:40.841 --> 10:42.480
of the Pans come out of hiding

10:42.520 --> 10:45.520
for an audience with the elves.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.760
Seems to me you still haven't.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.120
But our need is great;

10:51.160 --> 10:53.240
we face destruction,

10:53.241 --> 10:55.320
we humbly ask for your help.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.400
[grunts]

10:58.280 --> 10:59.560
Prrffff.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.920
This thing doesn't work at all.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.280
I can't hear anything!

11:04.320 --> 11:06.480
Aah! I do wish Onchao were here

11:06.481 --> 11:08.640
to help restore the Pan Glade.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.360
[Raynor] Be that as it may,

11:10.400 --> 11:11.700
I am honor-bound to help

11:11.701 --> 11:13.000
a fellow king in need.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.920
I shall...

11:14.960 --> 11:16.440
Phuddle?!

11:18.640 --> 11:21.280
You can't stay here!

11:21.320 --> 11:24.000
I wasn't asking to stay here.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.600
Eh...

11:25.601 --> 11:27.160
but now that you mention it...

11:27.200 --> 11:28.680
Yes, I think

11:28.681 --> 11:30.160
that's a capital idea.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.500
What?! Nooo! There's only room

11:32.501 --> 11:34.800
for one Pan around here!

11:34.840 --> 11:36.140
Phuddle, the King of Pans

11:36.141 --> 11:37.440
is our guest!

11:37.480 --> 11:38.560
We will extend him

11:38.561 --> 11:39.640
every courtesy!

11:39.680 --> 11:41.520
Ooouh..

11:41.560 --> 11:43.800
- Your highness, you are welcome
- to stay at the castle

11:43.840 --> 11:45.800
Until your home is restored.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.680
What's ours is yours.

11:47.720 --> 11:52.280
My profound thanks, King Raynor.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.600
This can only end badly!

11:54.601 --> 11:56.880
You mark my words!

11:56.920 --> 11:58.360
Uuugh!

11:58.400 --> 12:00.440
Aaagh! Oh!

12:00.480 --> 12:02.000
[distorted muttering]

12:02.001 --> 12:03.520
one Pan in this castle!

12:09.800 --> 12:11.400
[Mo] Aghh!

12:11.440 --> 12:12.640
Feels like we've been

12:12.641 --> 12:13.840
looking for hours!

12:15.080 --> 12:16.280
I give up!

12:16.320 --> 12:18.200
There's no trumptus piece here!

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
Onchao's never

12:19.241 --> 12:20.241
been wrong before.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.860
You guys ever get this weird

12:21.861 --> 12:23.440
feeling you're being watched?

12:23.480 --> 12:24.520
[gasps]

12:31.400 --> 12:32.720
Why don't they attack?

12:34.440 --> 12:35.960
You and your big mouth!

12:37.240 --> 12:39.200
[neighing]

12:39.240 --> 12:40.560
No way! They're not getting

12:40.561 --> 12:41.880
the unicorns!

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
[clicks]

12:44.560 --> 12:45.720
Oh no!

12:45.760 --> 12:47.120
Fight 'em any way you can!

12:58.520 --> 13:00.240
Oh no, you don't!

13:01.160 --> 13:02.200
[hissing]

13:04.840 --> 13:07.200
Run, Onchao! Run!

13:08.560 --> 13:10.240
[neighing]

13:12.400 --> 13:13.760
It's no use!

13:13.761 --> 13:15.120
We can't stop them!

13:15.160 --> 13:16.440
- What are we gonna do?!

13:16.441 --> 13:17.720
- Follow them!

13:17.760 --> 13:19.320
- We'll think of something
- on the way!

13:21.280 --> 13:22.800
Onchao! Stay out of sight

13:22.801 --> 13:24.320
until we get back!

13:28.160 --> 13:29.760
I've had three guest chambers

13:29.800 --> 13:32.000
- readied for the King of Pans
- and his family.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.336
- Do you think that
- will be enough?

13:33.360 --> 13:36.240
Eh... Uh... We are here.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.560
Welcome, my Pan frien...

13:38.600 --> 13:39.800
ds.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.680
[muttering]

13:41.720 --> 13:43.220
Oh! I'll have the spare pillows

13:43.221 --> 13:44.720
brought up.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.880
Oooh, nice digs!

13:46.920 --> 13:48.280
Gonna love it here!

13:48.320 --> 13:50.200
[chuckles]

13:50.240 --> 13:53.480
You brought your whole village?!

13:53.520 --> 13:55.580
Yes. We Pans believe

13:55.581 --> 13:57.640
there's safety in numbers.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.760
Oh!

14:00.400 --> 14:04.360
No! NO! NOOOOOO!

14:07.360 --> 14:08.480
Check it out.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.160
Panthea's palace.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.680
- They're taking those unicorns
- into something...

14:14.720 --> 14:16.080
Kind of like a pen.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.080
How many guards? Let me see!

14:18.120 --> 14:19.280
Too many to count.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.000
The pen is kind of hidden.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.480
I can't really see...

14:23.680 --> 14:26.080
[gasps] I don't believe it.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.160
What?

14:29.400 --> 14:30.960
I see the herd!

14:32.200 --> 14:33.240
[gasps]

14:34.240 --> 14:35.680
All the unicorns!

14:35.720 --> 14:37.040
They're alive!

14:37.080 --> 14:39.400
[gasps] That's incredible!

14:39.440 --> 14:40.640
Can I see?!

14:40.680 --> 14:42.480
That one looks familiar...

14:42.520 --> 14:44.520
[Mia] (GASPS) Lyria!

14:44.560 --> 14:45.760
[Yuko] She's alive!?

14:45.800 --> 14:48.000
We have to rescue her. NOW!

14:48.040 --> 14:49.080
Hold on a second.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.080
[Mia] Her horn is gone!

14:54.080 --> 14:55.280
All of them are!

14:55.320 --> 14:57.480
What's that witch done to her?!

14:58.560 --> 15:00.360
We have to get them now!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.080
We can't go in there!

15:02.120 --> 15:03.800
There's too many muncs!

15:03.801 --> 15:05.480
And we have no water!

15:05.520 --> 15:06.600
Well we can't leave them

15:06.601 --> 15:07.680
in there!

15:07.720 --> 15:09.260
What good is going to do them

15:09.261 --> 15:10.800
if we get captured!?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.500
Mo's right. All that matters is,

15:12.501 --> 15:14.160
Lyria's alive.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.840
Onchao can have his mother back.

15:15.841 --> 15:17.480
But don't tell Onchao.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.700
He'll try to go after her,

15:18.701 --> 15:19.880
and get himself caught.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.400
So what do we do then?!

15:21.440 --> 15:23.320
The only thing we can do.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.520
We find the last two pieces

15:24.521 --> 15:25.680
of the Trumptus.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.920
Rebuild it.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.160
And we blow that Trumptus

15:28.200 --> 15:30.120
right in Panthea's face so hard

15:30.160 --> 15:31.480
she won't know what hit her.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.800
Come on. Let's get Onchao.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.440
We've got work to do.

15:44.800 --> 15:49.720
[♪♪♪]

16:01.440 --> 16:05.000
[♪♪♪]

16:22.200 --> 16:24.720
[♪♪♪]

16:34.400 --> 16:35.440
[chuckles]

16:39.480 --> 16:40.560
[gasps]

16:40.600 --> 16:42.920
[muttering]

16:51.160 --> 16:52.960
[chomping]

17:01.960 --> 17:03.200
Aaaah ha!

17:14.520 --> 17:16.160
Sorry to have left you Onchao,

17:16.161 --> 17:17.800
but we discovered something

17:17.839 --> 17:19.920
- that I think
- will make you really happy.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.520
But first, we have to

17:21.521 --> 17:23.079
find the trumptus piece.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.119
We've been all over this place.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.480
There's nothing

17:29.481 --> 17:30.800
but dried-up clam shells.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.160
Aaaw!

17:32.200 --> 17:33.640
Mia, your hand!

17:33.680 --> 17:35.240
It's just a cut.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.160
- Will you stop being brave
- for two seconds

17:37.200 --> 17:38.400
And let me help you.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.200
Mo, really, it's nothing.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.040
There. Feel better?

17:51.080 --> 17:52.120
Thanks.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.200
[Mo] Oops...

17:54.280 --> 17:56.040
Hey, that shell...

17:56.080 --> 17:57.800
"Until it opens."

17:57.840 --> 17:59.360
That's what the oracle said.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.360
It's talking about a clam shell!

18:02.600 --> 18:05.040
Onchao, it's in a clam shell!

18:05.840 --> 18:07.520
Arrgh!

18:07.560 --> 18:09.000
How'd you get that one open?!

18:09.040 --> 18:10.480
A unicorn tear!

18:10.520 --> 18:12.320
- But we've only got
- a couple left.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.120
Onchao! C'mere, boy!

18:17.720 --> 18:20.120
Okay, you need to try hard.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.760
Which shell is it?

18:21.800 --> 18:22.960
[distant shrieking]

18:26.920 --> 18:29.280
And do it fast, Onchao. Muncs!

18:29.320 --> 18:31.120
- They must be coming back
- for Onchao!

18:31.160 --> 18:32.400
Focus, Onchao.

18:32.401 --> 18:33.640
Which shell is it?

18:39.320 --> 18:41.000
We don't have a lot of time.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.680
[sniffs]

18:47.120 --> 18:48.280
That one!

18:54.920 --> 18:56.880
Aaah... Now what?!

18:56.920 --> 18:59.440
Try again, Onchao. Just relax.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.280
Our last tear.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.760
He better be right.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.080
Just squeeze it already!

19:17.080 --> 19:18.720
Yess! I knew you could do it!

19:18.760 --> 19:20.400
Hug fast and let's go!

19:24.360 --> 19:25.540
- In the corner!

19:25.541 --> 19:26.720
- Over here! Come on! Oh oh.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.616
- Don't let them see you!
- I didn't let them see me.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.980
Hurry! Get down!

19:29.981 --> 19:31.320
Over here! [laugh]

19:31.360 --> 19:32.736
- Get down!
- They're gonna see you.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.160
- No, they won't, I'm...
- Oops!

19:34.200 --> 19:35.800
Come on! Somebody can see us.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.240
They're annoying you,

19:37.241 --> 19:38.640
aren't they?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.360
I knew it!

19:41.400 --> 19:42.680
You want to kick them out,

19:42.681 --> 19:43.960
don't you?

19:49.680 --> 19:51.360
[Yuko] Whoa!

19:51.400 --> 19:53.000
What happened here?!

19:53.880 --> 19:55.400
[muttering]

19:55.440 --> 19:56.520
Onchao!

19:57.880 --> 20:00.240
Onchao, might I ask you a favor?

20:00.280 --> 20:01.520
Could you please

20:01.521 --> 20:02.760
go to the Pan Glade

20:02.800 --> 20:04.280
and revive it

20:04.281 --> 20:05.760
in that special way you do?

20:05.800 --> 20:07.600
Yes, so our house guests

20:07.601 --> 20:09.400
can pack up and go home!

20:09.440 --> 20:11.320
Uuh uh.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.020
Uh, not that it hasn't been

20:13.021 --> 20:14.680
a pleasure having you.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.960
Pleasure? They've been

20:15.961 --> 20:17.200
about as much fun

20:17.240 --> 20:20.280
as a bad case of mange!

20:20.320 --> 20:22.160
- We just know how much
- you want to get back

20:22.200 --> 20:23.440
To hiding in the woods,

20:23.441 --> 20:24.680
that sort of thing.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.940
[Pan] (LAUGHS)

20:26.941 --> 20:29.160
Woohoo! We're going home!

20:29.200 --> 20:30.520
Woohoo!

20:41.800 --> 20:44.040
[neighs]

20:44.080 --> 20:45.200
No matter how many times

20:45.201 --> 20:46.320
I see him do that,

20:46.360 --> 20:48.200
it's still awesome!

20:48.240 --> 20:49.780
We owe your gracious king

20:49.781 --> 20:51.320
a debt of gratitude.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.020
Pans, we must return to the elf

20:57.021 --> 20:59.360
palace to offer our thanks!

21:00.520 --> 21:02.320
Uh, no need.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.640
Seeing you back in your home

21:03.641 --> 21:04.920
is thanks enough.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.260
Then we must thank

21:06.261 --> 21:07.560
our little friend here.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.060
Please, enjoy some

21:09.061 --> 21:10.520
Partridge berries,

21:10.560 --> 21:13.000
the Pans' most precious crop.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.600
[neighs]

21:14.640 --> 21:15.660
They know this is

21:15.661 --> 21:16.680
a temporary fix, right?

21:16.720 --> 21:18.240
Onchao can't keep coming back,

21:18.241 --> 21:19.760
and without unicorns...

21:19.800 --> 21:21.720
There will be unicorns.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.800
Soon enough.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.160
You got that right.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.520
How's your hand?

21:31.560 --> 21:32.920
Uum...

21:33.800 --> 21:35.520
it's fine.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.060
So, one more piece

21:37.061 --> 21:38.560
of the Trumptus, right?

21:38.600 --> 21:39.640
Right.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.720
Right.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.860
That means one more oracle.

21:44.861 --> 21:46.160
I'll be back.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.440
We'll be ready.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.360
[neighs]

22:00.680 --> 22:02.240
How's your prince?

22:03.160 --> 22:04.720
Um... Vincent,

22:04.760 --> 22:06.520
I don't know how to say this.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.600
You were right.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.360
Vincent, I...

22:11.400 --> 22:13.520
Hey, doesn't matter to me.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.760
He's a prince, he's got wings,

22:15.800 --> 22:17.880
his ears are pointy, I mean,

22:17.920 --> 22:19.360
who can compete with that?

22:23.320 --> 22:25.760
What's taking so long in here?

22:27.400 --> 22:29.120
There you go.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.240
- [Vincent] C'mon, let's watch
- the end of this.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.820
I know I'm dying to find out

22:32.821 --> 22:34.360
what happens to Prince

22:34.400 --> 22:36.320
- What's his Face and
- Countess-Whatever.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.520
Do you want me to go?

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
- NO!
- NO!
