(crowd gasping, applauding)

00:45.970 --> 00:48.604
Told any good lies lately?

00:48.606 --> 00:50.705
Lying is a part of human nature.

00:50.707 --> 00:52.675
We all tell lies.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.876
And those of you who don't

00:54.878 --> 00:57.679
are lying.

00:57.681 --> 01:01.316
Who wants to play? Who wants to play?

The lady in red will get you ahead.

Those are the odds and not the time,

01:43.660 --> 01:45.593
<i>The beauty of the three-card monte</i>

people know it's a scam,</i>

01:47.865 --> 01:49.598

03:05.375 --> 03:10.113

03:13.850 --> 03:17.051
<i>But we're talking about me,</i>

03:17.053 --> 03:19.422
<i>the good-looking one.</i>

03:40.044 --> 03:42.011
Aaah!

03:53.824 --> 03:55.890
It's all fun and games, Master Lawrence,

03:55.892 --> 03:57.893
until someone loses an eye.

03:57.895 --> 04:00.128
Can my son still sit the exam?

04:00.130 --> 04:02.563
Lawrence has brought
great shame to the school.

04:02.565 --> 04:05.434
There's also the injury to
young Jeremy Fong to consider.

04:05.436 --> 04:07.703
But no exam means no university.

04:07.705 --> 04:11.673
I'm afraid Lawrence must
suffer the maximum penalty.

04:11.675 --> 04:13.542
Lawrence?

04:13.544 --> 04:15.777
There are no short cuts.

04:15.779 --> 04:18.781
Cheating will never get you anywhere.

04:20.784 --> 04:23.719
But, Mum, everyone's
going. There'll be girls.

04:23.721 --> 04:27.022
- You're not going to Schooler Paradise.
- Surfer's Paradise.

04:27.024 --> 04:29.123
You promised us you studied.

04:29.125 --> 04:32.594
- You lied to your family.
- Our entire family is full of doctors.

04:32.596 --> 04:34.298
Don't we have enough?

04:35.565 --> 04:38.066
- What are you going to be then, huh?
- I don't know.

04:38.068 --> 04:42.470
My sister in China has bought a
ticket to come to your graduation.

04:42.472 --> 04:45.873
- What am I going to tell her?
- You can tell her about Schooler's Paradise.

04:45.875 --> 04:49.212
(speaking Chinese)

05:03.993 --> 05:06.628
Fine! I'll pay you back.

05:06.630 --> 05:09.166
Every last cent.

05:15.039 --> 05:17.205
LAWRENCE (narrating):
<i>What did they expect?</i>

05:17.207 --> 05:19.508
<i>The average person
lies six times a day.</i>

05:19.510 --> 05:22.643
<i>And I only cheated that one time.</i>

05:22.645 --> 05:25.847
<i>I guess you gotta start somewhere.</i>

05:25.849 --> 05:28.684
(man chattering)

05:28.686 --> 05:31.085
- What the hell!
- You want a phone, you need a job.

05:31.087 --> 05:34.890
You want a job, you need an education.

05:34.892 --> 05:38.996
- (bell chiming)
- <i>(woman on PA, indistinct)</i>

05:41.130 --> 05:44.866
- Chinese lucky money?
- Call as soon as you get there.

05:44.868 --> 05:46.835
With what?

05:46.837 --> 05:49.240
Try to be a good boy.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.414
(Chinese)

06:12.061 --> 06:15.864
Look at these monkeys. They think
they get something for nothing.

06:15.866 --> 06:19.436
But they're just idiots for us to laugh at.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.080
You need to work hard for what you want.

06:32.082 --> 06:35.052
Life is not a game show.

06:37.887 --> 06:42.090
Lawrence, just because your father
sent you here as a punishment

06:42.092 --> 06:44.092
does not mean you cannot have fun.

06:44.094 --> 06:46.929
I can put on my computer
for you to play on.

06:46.931 --> 06:49.965
- Do you have a modem?
- No, Lawrence.

06:49.967 --> 06:52.169
A Macintosh.

06:57.941 --> 06:59.943
(button clicks)

07:03.780 --> 07:05.647
LAWRENCE (narrating):
<i>Uncle Sam loved chess.</i>

07:05.649 --> 07:08.116
<i>I mean, really loved it.</i>

07:08.118 --> 07:11.152
<i>Chess taught him everything
that was important in life...</i>

07:11.154 --> 07:15.491
<i>discipline, tradition,
self-control.</i>

07:17.695 --> 07:20.027
<i>I want to die.</i>

07:20.029 --> 07:23.032
(clocks ticking)

07:36.613 --> 07:40.681
Lawrence, Soo Jin is our club champion.

07:40.683 --> 07:42.818
Lawrence is very smart.

07:42.820 --> 07:45.720
Make a good Chinese boyfriend. (chuckles)

07:45.722 --> 07:48.390
I will leave you two kids together.

07:48.392 --> 07:52.126
I'm sure you'll have lots to talk about.

07:52.128 --> 07:56.765
- She's eight.
- No, Soo Jin is 10, and I'm 52.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.267
Anyone who can beat your
uncle in a game of chess

07:59.269 --> 08:03.073
must have something worthwhile to say.

08:07.811 --> 08:10.111
(loud clattering)

08:10.113 --> 08:14.417
(chuckling) That's the spirit.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.785
Excuse me, sir.

08:17.787 --> 08:20.888
If you're not here to play chess,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

08:20.890 --> 08:24.225
My good man, I am here to play.

08:24.227 --> 08:26.328
A visitor's game is five dollars.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.962
(chuckling)

08:27.964 --> 08:31.667
Who's the president of
this fine establishment?

08:31.669 --> 08:34.301
- I am.
- Oh, excellent.

08:34.303 --> 08:37.304
You're a man of chess, no less.

08:37.307 --> 08:39.974
A yellow Kasparov. (chuckling)

08:39.976 --> 08:42.309
I, too, am quite the master

08:42.312 --> 08:46.047
even if I do say so myself, which I do!

08:46.049 --> 08:49.051
I've not been beaten for nine years.

08:49.053 --> 08:51.753
This is a tragedy, but
I've come all the way...

08:51.755 --> 08:54.955
to the antipodes for a new challenge.

08:54.957 --> 08:59.161
Mr. President, I propose to you a wager.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.263
Defeat me in a single game,

09:02.265 --> 09:06.868
and you can ram-jam
ramabam these 50 clams...

09:06.870 --> 09:08.970
into your old skyrocket.

09:08.972 --> 09:10.705
I don't play for money.

09:10.707 --> 09:14.042
Oh! (mutters)

09:14.044 --> 09:17.378
(chuckles) So who is the
best player in the club?

09:17.380 --> 09:19.181
- Me!
- Ah!

09:19.183 --> 09:22.050
I won the club championship three times.

09:22.052 --> 09:24.720
Oh, my.

09:24.722 --> 09:26.922
Delighted to meet you, young lady.

09:26.924 --> 09:29.559
Enough!

09:32.361 --> 09:36.031
In that case, I shall defeat you all.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.166
This is a serious club.

09:38.168 --> 09:41.836
Very well. I shall defeat
at least half of you.

09:41.838 --> 09:44.105
Gentlemen... and young lady...

09:44.107 --> 09:47.209
the terms of tonight's wager.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.244
I shall play you, Chairman Mao.

09:49.246 --> 09:51.278
In fact, I shall play you all.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.282
I stake my money that A:
I will defeat you, sir,

09:55.284 --> 09:58.253
B: I will defeat at least half of you,

09:58.255 --> 10:00.321
and C:

10:00.323 --> 10:06.262
I will play you all at
exactly the same time!

10:42.533 --> 10:44.701
Hmm.

10:54.911 --> 10:57.180
Hmm. Well.

11:33.449 --> 11:35.883
(grunts)

11:35.885 --> 11:38.722
Checkmate. Yes!

11:44.260 --> 11:47.396
(grunting)

12:04.981 --> 12:10.886
Gentlemen, thank you for
being so gracious in defeat.

12:10.888 --> 12:13.654
But ruminate on this.

12:13.656 --> 12:18.058
Next time, I might play sober.

12:18.060 --> 12:21.930
- (chuckling)
- (murmuring)

12:21.932 --> 12:24.065
SOO JIN: He's brilliant.

12:24.067 --> 12:27.371
Yeah. Very clever.

12:37.514 --> 12:41.649
Why would you be following
an old drunk down an alley?

12:41.651 --> 12:45.152
I'm a good judge of character, young man,

12:45.154 --> 12:48.956
and you don't look like a ruffian to me.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.426
- You forgot something.
- Ah, my whiskey!

12:51.428 --> 12:54.095
Thank you.

12:54.097 --> 12:57.998
Your cold tea.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.700
A harmless little deception

12:59.702 --> 13:02.470
in order to lower the
expectations of one's adversaries.

13:02.472 --> 13:05.005
You're very perceptive for a
young man who doesn't play chess.

13:05.007 --> 13:06.574
Neither do you.

13:06.576 --> 13:09.109
But you just saw me play 10 games at once.

13:09.111 --> 13:10.979
I'm the grand pooh-bah.

13:10.981 --> 13:12.947
I haven't lost a match in 12 years.

13:12.949 --> 13:15.617
- Nine years.
- Well, time flies when you're having fun.

13:15.619 --> 13:19.589
You didn't win 10 games. You
didn't win any games at all.

13:22.491 --> 13:24.725
<i>You played them against each other.</i>

13:24.727 --> 13:27.162
<i>You watched the move one
player made against you...</i>

13:27.164 --> 13:30.598
<i>and copied it on the opposite board.</i>

13:30.600 --> 13:34.402
<i>Of course you would
win half the games.</i>

13:34.404 --> 13:37.037
<i>And you beat my uncle</i>

13:37.039 --> 13:39.574
<i>because you played him
against the club champion.</i>

13:39.576 --> 13:43.345
Checkmate. Yes!

13:43.347 --> 13:46.715
(laughing)

13:46.717 --> 13:49.584
Lawrence, isn't it?

13:49.586 --> 13:52.186
Well, Lawrence, you've busted my gaffe.

13:52.188 --> 13:55.156
You're Joe hep. You're hep to the game.

13:55.158 --> 13:59.730
And your keen eye has earned
you a pineapple here tonight.

14:01.331 --> 14:04.032
Would you mind?

14:04.034 --> 14:06.401
So you walk in, steal their money

14:06.403 --> 14:08.168
and walk away just like that?

14:08.170 --> 14:11.672
Lawrence, that hurts.

14:11.674 --> 14:15.509
I didn't break any of the
Ten Commandments tonight.

14:15.511 --> 14:17.644
I didn't murder anybody.

14:17.646 --> 14:20.581
I didn't covet my neighbor's donkey,

14:20.583 --> 14:24.418
and I certainly didn't steal anything.

14:24.420 --> 14:27.755
You've just insulted an
old man who gave you $50.

14:27.757 --> 14:29.556
My uncle's $50.

14:29.558 --> 14:32.326
The lure of easy money...

14:32.328 --> 14:35.129
clouds rational thought.

14:35.131 --> 14:37.165
You cannot cheat an honest man.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.133
That is the first rule of my occupation.

14:39.135 --> 14:40.701
A con man.

14:40.703 --> 14:46.041
I prefer the term "professional liar."

14:46.043 --> 14:48.375
- SAM: Lawrence!
- I should go... Wait!

14:48.377 --> 14:50.512
- My money.
- Easy come, easy go.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.081
That also tends to be something of a rule.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.716
I need that money.

14:55.718 --> 15:01.790
If you want to earn it back,
Sunday morning at the mall.

15:01.792 --> 15:04.895
Good evening, <i>Lawrence.</i>

15:25.115 --> 15:27.484
Come on, mate.

15:38.761 --> 15:40.862
Good morning.

15:40.864 --> 15:42.629
Good morning, young man.

15:42.631 --> 15:45.332
It's Lawrence.

15:45.334 --> 15:47.167
What are you doing here?

15:47.169 --> 15:49.470
You said you might need a hand.

15:49.472 --> 15:51.505
What kind of hand?

15:51.507 --> 15:53.675
With whatever scam you've got going on.

15:53.677 --> 15:56.110
Do you think you might
like to speak up a little?

15:56.112 --> 15:59.082
I don't think everybody quite heard you.

16:00.483 --> 16:04.219
Look about you. What do you see, hmm?

16:04.221 --> 16:05.753
Magazines.

16:05.755 --> 16:08.422
For every imaginable interest,

16:08.424 --> 16:10.859
but they're all concerned with desire.

16:10.861 --> 16:14.029
People want what they can't have.

16:15.465 --> 16:19.200
Some are more obviously
concerned with desire.

16:19.202 --> 16:21.702
Persuasion is about giving
people what they want.

16:21.704 --> 16:26.541
- I don't want this.
- Perhaps not, Master Lawrence.

16:26.543 --> 16:28.645
But ask yourself this.

16:32.381 --> 16:35.383
(muttering) Turn around.

16:35.385 --> 16:39.523
- What do you want, hmm?
- (writing)

16:46.795 --> 16:48.797
Thank you.

16:52.769 --> 16:55.603
- My wife is seven months pregnant.
- Excuse me?

16:55.605 --> 16:57.672
A long-time customer
of this establishment.

16:57.674 --> 16:59.641
A subscriber to many fine magazines.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.643
I'm sorry. What was her name?

17:01.645 --> 17:04.744
- And you send her this.
- Oh. Dear.

17:04.747 --> 17:07.781
Perhaps we could just exchange
it for the correct publication.

17:07.784 --> 17:10.584
Yes, of course. I do apologize.

17:10.586 --> 17:12.587
- No, no, no.
- If there's anything I can do.

17:12.589 --> 17:13.921
Not at all.

17:13.923 --> 17:15.490
However... (chuckling)

17:15.492 --> 17:18.525
she's always complaining about the
lack of a good pair of scissors.

17:18.527 --> 17:21.596
Ah. How much for your very best pair?

17:21.598 --> 17:23.599
Oh, please.

17:24.967 --> 17:27.635
It would be my pleasure, sir.

17:27.637 --> 17:29.870
Oh, that is too kind.

17:29.872 --> 17:32.641
Thank you. Good day.

17:34.977 --> 17:38.312
Confidence is about trust.

17:38.314 --> 17:40.747
- Can I borrow $50?
- You already have my 50.

17:40.749 --> 17:44.186
Hmm, I suppose you might see it that way.

17:46.389 --> 17:49.256
Do you really think you've
got what it takes, hmm?

17:49.258 --> 17:51.126
Sure.

17:55.398 --> 17:59.399
Convince her to take the money.

17:59.401 --> 18:01.336
- My $50?
- Yep.

18:01.338 --> 18:04.741
But you have to keep the wallet.

18:11.915 --> 18:13.947
Oh, sorry. Is that your wallet?

18:13.949 --> 18:16.350
Um, no. Is it yours?

18:16.352 --> 18:18.485
- No, it's a man's wallet.
- Yes, um...

18:18.487 --> 18:21.321
- Anyway, do you want the money?
- What? No.

18:21.323 --> 18:24.259
I mean, I just thought I'd keep the
wallet, and you could have the...

18:24.261 --> 18:25.760
Here.

18:25.762 --> 18:28.562
See if there's any ID in it.

18:28.564 --> 18:31.398
- Look, a family man.
- Oh, and $50.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.868
- Don't you want it?
- No. Isn't there, like, a card or something?

18:33.870 --> 18:37.804
No. Wait.

18:37.806 --> 18:39.907
All right.

18:39.909 --> 18:42.377
- (change drops)
- <i>(line rings)</i>

18:42.379 --> 18:43.844
Hello. Is this...

18:43.846 --> 18:45.913
Yes, speaking.

18:45.915 --> 18:49.684
Oh, really? Oh, thank goodness.

18:49.686 --> 18:52.887
What is your name?
Sarah. Oh, that's lovely.

18:52.889 --> 18:55.555
(chuckles) Yes, I have
a daughter called Sarah.

18:55.557 --> 18:57.759
Listen, anyway, we've
got your wallet, so...

18:57.761 --> 18:59.926
<i>Look, I'd like to give you a reward.</i>

18:59.928 --> 19:01.995
<i>Those photos mean so much to me.</i>

19:01.997 --> 19:04.465
<i>How does $200 sound?</i>

19:04.467 --> 19:06.567
- That's not necessary.
- <i>No, not at all.</i>

19:06.569 --> 19:11.438
It's for your honesty.
It's such a rare quality.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.574
- Hey! Give me the wallet.
- No, I found it.

19:14.576 --> 19:17.844
- Look, I want the wallet.
- Keep the 50. I'm keeping the wallet.

19:17.846 --> 19:20.947
- It's a man's wallet.
- I want it for my dad. You take the money.

19:20.949 --> 19:22.917
The wallet's worth more than $50.

19:22.919 --> 19:25.552
Yes. So?

19:25.554 --> 19:27.487
Take the money?

19:27.489 --> 19:30.824
No, you idiot. What are you doing?

19:30.826 --> 19:32.627
- Please take the money?
- Oh, my God.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.896
(picks up receiver)

19:34.898 --> 19:37.799
He's an idiot.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.501
He wants to talk to you.

19:40.503 --> 19:42.338
Hello?

19:44.774 --> 19:48.342
You're supposed to say, "How
'bout I sell you the wallet?

19:48.344 --> 19:50.610
How much are you willing to pay?"

19:50.612 --> 19:52.679
This is the guy that
busted your chess swindle?

19:52.681 --> 19:57.718
This is Lawrence. He's no Laurence Olivier.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.619
But he is damn cute.

19:59.621 --> 20:02.557
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>Yeah.
She didn't say that.</i>

20:02.559 --> 20:04.658
(voices rewinding)

20:04.660 --> 20:08.495
- This is the guy that busted your chess swindle?
- This is Lawrence.

20:08.497 --> 20:11.631
I told you that scam was
rubbish. It's old, and so are you.

20:11.633 --> 20:14.136
Lawrence, meet Sarah.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.041
Come on, Dad. We can do better.

20:20.043 --> 20:22.746
We leave tomorrow night.

20:33.823 --> 20:35.689
WOMEN: <i>♪ Don't, don't ♪</i>

20:35.691 --> 20:37.125

21:03.152 --> 21:05.086
I've never heard of such a thing.

21:05.088 --> 21:07.655
It's like a bus with medical students.

21:07.657 --> 21:10.057
We drive around to help
out country hospitals.

21:10.059 --> 21:12.760
- Medibus.
- But you are not a medical student.

21:12.762 --> 21:15.331
Not yet.

21:16.733 --> 21:20.503
I need a job if I'm ever
going to pay back Dad.

21:22.772 --> 21:25.106
Lots of driving. Very dangerous.

21:25.108 --> 21:27.707
At least if we have an accident,
the bus is full of doctors.

21:27.709 --> 21:29.577
Hey. (speaking Cantonese)

21:29.579 --> 21:31.611
It's a joke, Uncle.

21:31.613 --> 21:35.183
Why don't you ever speak Cantonese?

21:35.185 --> 21:37.387
Thanks for everything, Uncle.

21:41.157 --> 21:43.224
Make sure to call every few days.

21:43.226 --> 21:44.992
I will.

21:44.994 --> 21:47.397
Ah! (Cantonese)

21:49.732 --> 21:51.568
(gasps)

22:00.642 --> 22:04.177
With a belly full of hot
tea, all is in harmony.

22:04.179 --> 22:06.513
- Confucius?
- No, Lawrence.

22:06.515 --> 22:09.384
Antioxidants.

22:25.168 --> 22:28.404
- (chattering)
- (silverware clinking)

22:45.554 --> 22:48.755
I want to learn to do what you do.

22:48.757 --> 22:50.291
What do you think it is that I do?

22:50.293 --> 22:53.329
You're a con artist, aren't you?

22:54.596 --> 22:57.197
I'm a reader of people.

22:57.199 --> 22:59.766
Ordinary people.

22:59.768 --> 23:03.003
What about that man?
What do you think he does?

23:03.005 --> 23:05.106
- He's a businessman.
- Mm-hmm.

23:05.108 --> 23:08.275
- A stockbroker or something.
- How do you know that?

23:08.277 --> 23:10.878
It's an expensive suit.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.747
Cheap shoes.

23:13.749 --> 23:16.684
The affectation of status.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.985
That's his tell.

23:18.987 --> 23:21.187
He's a salesman, popular at school,

23:21.189 --> 23:23.724
probably captain of the football team.

23:23.726 --> 23:26.726
- He's married, but he's having an affair.
- How do you know?

23:26.728 --> 23:29.129
He has a mobile, but
he's using a pay phone.

23:29.131 --> 23:31.232
- His wife checks his bills.
- The battery could be flat.

23:31.234 --> 23:33.269
(chuckles)

23:35.772 --> 23:38.939
I used to have partners.

23:38.941 --> 23:41.676
Long ago, far away.

23:41.678 --> 23:45.846
We pulled long cons,
short cons, card scams.

23:45.848 --> 23:48.349
We played the Melon Drop, the Rainmaker,

23:48.351 --> 23:52.088
the Fiddle Game, the
Wire, and even the Badger.

23:53.156 --> 23:56.657
Always assume that the more
sordid explanation is correct.

23:56.659 --> 23:59.329
(cell phone rings)

24:01.663 --> 24:03.965
Hi, honey.

24:03.967 --> 24:06.766
Yes. Still at work.

24:06.768 --> 24:10.372
Yeah. Sure.

24:13.242 --> 24:15.842
Lawrence,

24:15.844 --> 24:18.878
the game is not a game.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.815
- You would have to follow my directions.
- Of course.

24:21.817 --> 24:23.850
I need to be able to trust you.

24:23.852 --> 24:26.620
There's no running back home the
first time things become tricky.

24:26.622 --> 24:28.188
It's not going to happen.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.791
And another thing.

24:30.793 --> 24:34.695
You must never tell
anybody about this. Ever.

24:34.697 --> 24:37.263
Any of it.

24:37.265 --> 24:39.233
Would you promise?

24:39.235 --> 24:43.370
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>I... promise.</i>

24:43.372 --> 24:47.774
WOMAN: <i>♪ Borders

24:47.776 --> 24:49.676

LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>My
parents would have killed me.</i>

26:11.259 --> 26:13.293
<i>I wasn't even allowed sleepovers.</i>

26:13.295 --> 26:16.362
- <i>And these people were criminals...</i>
- (snoring)

26:16.364 --> 26:18.365
<i>but I didn't care.</i>

26:18.367 --> 26:22.235
<i>I was exactly where I wanted to be.</i>

26:22.237 --> 26:25.906
<i>The first scam I learned
was the Lost Trinket.</i>

26:25.908 --> 26:28.475
<i>We would look for the
worst pub in town...</i>

26:28.477 --> 26:32.279
- (sheep bleating)
- <i>with the dodgiest barman.</i>

26:32.281 --> 26:34.749
<i>Someone with greed in their bones.</i>

26:34.751 --> 26:37.517
I call these suckers tin mittens.

26:37.519 --> 26:41.289
(clinking)

26:43.126 --> 26:45.225
You know I did drama at school, right?

26:45.227 --> 26:49.231
Shut up, Lawrence. Do you want
to go home to your stupid family?

26:51.934 --> 26:55.101
- What can I get you?
- A drink for me and the lovely lady.

26:55.103 --> 26:56.536
Just a beer, thanks.

26:56.538 --> 26:59.773
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>There
are five steps to any good con.</i>

26:59.775 --> 27:01.841
<i>First is roping the sucker.</i>

27:01.843 --> 27:04.147
(laughs)

27:05.214 --> 27:08.815
<i>We'd have a drink, sit
around for a bit, then leave.</i>

27:08.817 --> 27:11.217
Could you quit the Hamlet routine?

27:11.219 --> 27:13.052
What?

27:13.054 --> 27:16.290
<i>The next day, I would
come back to the same bar.</i>

27:16.292 --> 27:19.526
Hello, my good lady.

27:19.528 --> 27:21.161
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:21.163 --> 27:22.830
- My intended and I...
- My fiancée and I...

27:22.832 --> 27:25.166
- were here the other day...
- And when she was dancing by the jukebox...

27:25.168 --> 27:26.501
when she went to powder her nose...

27:26.503 --> 27:27.901
- we think she lost...
- she dropped...
- her pendant.

27:27.903 --> 27:30.939
- I was hoping you might have...
- Wondering if you found it?

27:32.374 --> 27:34.841
- No.
- It's really special to us.

27:34.843 --> 27:37.011
- Family heirloom.
- It really means a lot to me.

27:37.013 --> 27:40.880
- So if anyone finds it...
- could you ask them to call this number?

27:40.882 --> 27:44.452
We're willing to offer you a $1,000 reward.

27:46.922 --> 27:49.023
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>Some time
later, the Professor would arrive.</i>

27:49.025 --> 27:51.861
(laughing)

27:53.361 --> 27:57.164
<i>His favorite routine was
to pretend to be drunk.</i>

27:57.166 --> 28:00.135
- (groans)
- (grunts)

28:03.573 --> 28:06.840
- Ooh.
- Look what I found.

28:06.842 --> 28:10.343
Fuck me.

28:10.345 --> 28:13.513
- That's mine.
- Oh, finders keepers.

28:13.515 --> 28:16.216
It's worth a pretty penny, I'd wager.

28:16.218 --> 28:19.019
Mmm. (chuckles)

28:19.021 --> 28:20.553
- Fifty bucks.
- A hundred?

28:20.555 --> 28:22.555
Looks like gold to me.

28:22.557 --> 28:24.358
200. That's it.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.061
I think I'll just hang on to it.

28:27.063 --> 28:28.329
- 250.
- 300.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.765
- 375.
- 400.

28:33.134 --> 28:35.837
And a six-pack.

28:37.239 --> 28:39.173
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>The
most money we ever made was...</i>

28:39.175 --> 28:40.976
(cash register dings)

28:45.547 --> 28:47.513
550.

28:47.515 --> 28:50.686
Hand it over, codger.

28:52.220 --> 28:54.256
(groans)

28:55.624 --> 28:58.024
<i>The final step is
the most important.</i>

28:58.026 --> 28:59.627
Come on, come on.

28:59.629 --> 29:03.296
- <i>When the bartender calls the number...</i>
- Yes. Hello.

29:03.298 --> 29:05.634
Listen, I've found your necklace.

29:07.370 --> 29:11.405
The family heirloom. What?

29:11.407 --> 29:14.440
(speaking Chinese)

29:14.442 --> 29:17.578
Huh?

29:17.580 --> 29:19.948
- Shit.
- Fuck.

29:28.925 --> 29:31.961
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>If he
tried to sell the necklace...</i>

29:37.198 --> 29:40.199
<i>And best of all, she
can't tell the police...</i>

29:40.201 --> 29:43.404
<i>because she took the money
straight from the cash register.</i>

29:43.406 --> 29:45.673
Sneaky fuckers.

29:45.675 --> 29:48.978
Ah. Dodgy prigs.

30:08.698 --> 30:10.630
(sighs) Fuck this.

30:10.632 --> 30:14.469
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a walk. He could be ages.

30:16.738 --> 30:19.473
- Do you actually do that?
- My record's two minutes.

30:19.475 --> 30:21.877
I've never been able to do it.

30:23.079 --> 30:26.347
My mum taught me. She
can do it in 90 seconds.

30:26.349 --> 30:28.314
Here.

30:28.316 --> 30:30.717
She sounds like fun.

30:30.719 --> 30:33.488
If you think it's fun being a kid.

30:37.092 --> 30:39.292
Where's your mum?

30:39.294 --> 30:41.762
She left. What do I do first?

30:41.764 --> 30:44.667
Because of the Professor?

30:57.646 --> 31:01.247
He says the older I get,
the more I speak like her.

31:01.249 --> 31:05.787
You know, I can see her face,
but I have no memory of her voice.

31:07.023 --> 31:09.122
I wonder what she sounds like now,

31:09.124 --> 31:11.526
who she's talking to.

31:14.229 --> 31:16.664
You're not the only one who
gets treated like a child.

31:21.269 --> 31:24.138
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>We pulled
all kinds of different scams,</i>

31:24.140 --> 31:26.139
<i>but what the Professor
really loved...</i>

31:26.141 --> 31:27.640
<i>was cards.</i>

31:27.642 --> 31:31.078
No one knows exactly,

31:31.080 --> 31:33.446
but it's believed that
cards were invented...

31:33.448 --> 31:36.516
somewhere in the seventh century...

31:36.518 --> 31:38.385
by the Chinese.

31:38.387 --> 31:40.188
LAWRENCE (narrating):
<i>What didn't we invent?</i>

31:50.599 --> 31:53.466
PROFESSOR: <i>Cards were brought
down the Silk Road to markets</i>

31:53.468 --> 31:56.171
<i>in Egypt and the Holy Land.</i>

32:00.642 --> 32:02.678
<i>Originally,</i>

32:03.711 --> 32:06.881
<i>they were used to
predict the future.</i>

32:10.218 --> 32:13.520
<i>In the 15th century, in Germany,</i>

32:13.522 --> 32:16.926
<i>the printing press allowed
cards to be mass-produced.</i>

32:22.497 --> 32:26.468
- <i>Games of chance flourished across Europe.</i>
- (men laughing)

32:28.536 --> 32:32.941
<i>And of course, the card
cheats weren't far behind.</i>

33:20.922 --> 33:23.590
- Hold out your left hand.
- I'm right-handed.

33:23.592 --> 33:25.226
Oh, really?

33:27.463 --> 33:31.564
This... is your deck.

33:31.566 --> 33:36.436
The cards must become an
extension of your body.

33:36.438 --> 33:39.840
But keep them in your hand
even when you're asleep.

33:39.842 --> 33:42.909
You must become intimate
with the weight, the feel,

33:42.911 --> 33:45.378
the size of them.

33:45.380 --> 33:47.246
Like the touch of a lover's breast.

33:47.248 --> 33:49.919
Wax on, wax off.

34:00.528 --> 34:04.764
That's a bezique deck...

34:04.766 --> 34:06.802
from 1910.

34:07.902 --> 34:10.803
All 64 of them.

34:10.804 --> 34:13.505
Cards used to be known as pasteboards.

34:13.507 --> 34:16.210
You just feel the thickness of those.

34:17.545 --> 34:22.547
There's over a hundred
years of grit on them.

34:22.550 --> 34:24.984
It's the most valuable thing that I own.

34:24.985 --> 34:28.521
- What about me?
- I don't own you, my dear.

34:28.523 --> 34:31.225
That much is obvious.

34:31.226 --> 34:34.360
These are beautiful.

34:34.362 --> 34:36.329
Where'd you get them from?

34:36.331 --> 34:38.967
They were a wedding
gift from an old friend.

34:40.568 --> 34:42.902
The only thing from that
friendship that survived.

34:42.905 --> 34:44.771
(chuckles)

34:44.773 --> 34:47.306
You never talk about Riley.

34:47.309 --> 34:48.809
Who's Riley?

34:48.811 --> 34:50.610
We could have been brothers.

34:50.612 --> 34:52.879
He taught me how to play cards.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.514
- He was a confidence man?
- He was no con man.

34:56.516 --> 34:58.352
He was a thief.

34:58.354 --> 35:00.586
You blame him for everything.

35:00.588 --> 35:03.724
He took something very precious from me.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.628
Maybe she was just bored.

36:32.581 --> 36:36.015
The hand is faster than the mind.

36:55.003 --> 36:57.104

- No!

37:17.825 --> 37:20.559
- Excuse me!
- If you want to check the sign out there,

37:20.561 --> 37:23.162
you'll see it's "secondhand record store."

37:23.164 --> 37:26.032
It's record. Analogue.

37:26.034 --> 37:29.903
A-N-A-L-O-G-U-E.

37:29.905 --> 37:34.943
So if you want to listen to music on
your telephone, then I can't help you.

37:40.581 --> 37:43.149
Ai-yi-yi-yi.

37:43.151 --> 37:46.086
The chopsticks are an
extension of your body.

37:46.088 --> 37:48.088
Very amusing. Yeah.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.689
I thought you were supposed
to be good with your hands.

37:50.691 --> 37:53.459
Well, I know when I'm beaten.

37:53.461 --> 37:56.695
Ah. (chuckles) Charity.

37:56.697 --> 37:58.533
Thank you.

38:01.135 --> 38:03.169
Lawrence, this is actually really good.

38:03.171 --> 38:06.106
Mmm.

38:06.108 --> 38:09.642
You have excelled yourself, young man.

38:09.644 --> 38:13.079
I would like to propose a toast.

38:13.081 --> 38:16.816
Yeah. In order to welcome Lawrence

38:16.818 --> 38:19.587
to our little family of outcasts.

38:22.124 --> 38:24.827
Lawrence.

38:30.097 --> 38:32.366
I've had an idea for a scam.

38:37.773 --> 38:40.142
(bell dings)

38:47.182 --> 38:49.149
- Yes?
- (broken English) Oh, wow.

38:49.151 --> 38:51.550
Very happy I am you have this band.

38:51.552 --> 38:53.720
I've looked all over Japan for it.

38:53.722 --> 38:55.955
I've looked on worldwide super highway.

38:55.957 --> 38:58.492
eBay. No can find.

38:58.494 --> 39:00.093
How much you want it for?

39:00.095 --> 39:04.798
Uh... Mmm. Minimal stylus damage.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.568
Patina on the cover, slightly foxed.

39:08.570 --> 39:11.838
Let's say $15.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.573
- Fifteen dollar?
- Australian.

39:13.575 --> 39:15.742
Fifteen dollar? Are you crazy in the mind?

39:15.744 --> 39:17.209
All right. Ten?

39:17.211 --> 39:19.211
I not pay you 10 or 15.

39:19.213 --> 39:23.517
I pay you 50!

39:23.519 --> 39:25.218
What the hell was that?

39:25.220 --> 39:27.586
- Japanese foreign exchange student.
- Aren't you Chinese?

39:27.588 --> 39:29.289
- I've got range.
- Great con.

39:29.291 --> 39:33.225
So we're $50 down and holding
a piece-of-shit record called...

39:33.227 --> 39:36.898
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Telling the Tale.</i>

39:38.200 --> 39:41.667
Ah, excuse me. Have you carry
another album like this one?

39:41.669 --> 39:44.303
Ah, no, no. Sadly, no.

39:44.305 --> 39:46.705
Oh! Because I need two album.

39:46.707 --> 39:49.608
One album to take home
to Japan. I'm from Japan.

39:49.610 --> 39:53.079
To put in picture frame on wall
to show my high school friends.

39:53.081 --> 39:55.148
And one to play, to listen to it.

39:55.150 --> 39:57.149
One album to play, to listen to it,

39:57.151 --> 39:59.251
and one to put in picture frame on my wall

39:59.253 --> 40:01.988
to show my high school friends, in Japan.

40:01.990 --> 40:04.890
I'm afraid I can't help you.
This is a very, very obscure item.

40:04.892 --> 40:07.794
It's very rare, and
it's quite valuable too.

40:07.796 --> 40:09.729
I know. You not tell me this.

40:09.731 --> 40:12.265
I looked on eBay. Rory MacLachlan.

40:12.267 --> 40:15.568
So popular in Japan. That's where I'm from.

40:15.570 --> 40:18.571
Listen, Jackie Chan, you understand
the meaning of the word "obscure"?

40:18.573 --> 40:21.941
Tunnel of Sound is a rarities
and collectibles emporium.

40:21.943 --> 40:25.278
We sell only the
exceptional and the uncommon.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.912
Now fuck off.

40:26.914 --> 40:29.783
Oh.

40:29.785 --> 40:31.318
- Mister.
- (groans)

40:31.320 --> 40:33.887
You don't understand. I'm a really big fan.

40:33.889 --> 40:36.189
- What?
- A really big fan.

40:36.191 --> 40:38.325
Please, listen to me.

40:38.327 --> 40:40.026
I come back in one weeks.

40:40.028 --> 40:43.229
If you have another album like this
one, I will pay you big money for it.

40:43.231 --> 40:45.233
Top dollar.

40:46.300 --> 40:50.102
He will believe me, 'cause I just
spent 50 bucks on a shit record.

40:50.104 --> 40:52.106
Okay. What now?

40:55.610 --> 40:59.680
No fucking way.

41:07.789 --> 41:10.155
- Let's go over what you're going to say.
- Can we?

41:10.157 --> 41:13.660
Your boyfriend's dumped you.
You're upset, on the verge of tears.

41:13.662 --> 41:16.229
He gave you these records, but
now you want to get rid of them.

41:16.231 --> 41:17.863
Wipe the slate clean.

41:17.865 --> 41:21.233
- But when you get to...
- I couldn't only sell it for 50 bucks. I get it.

41:21.235 --> 41:23.035
What if he recognizes his own record?

41:23.037 --> 41:27.039
He won't. He'll get distracted by your...

41:27.041 --> 41:30.311
- My what?
- Outfit.

41:32.914 --> 41:34.948
- Don't forget to upsell.
- Lawrence, I got this.

41:34.950 --> 41:37.182
This guy's gonna pay up
big for his own record.

41:37.184 --> 41:38.785
(broken English) Top dollar.

41:38.787 --> 41:40.689
(bell dings)

41:45.160 --> 41:48.061
- Did you want to sell those?
- Yeah, sure.

41:48.063 --> 41:50.863
I'll give you 20 bucks for the lot.

41:50.865 --> 41:53.832
Wait! Thank God I found you.

41:53.834 --> 41:55.869
Sorry. These are my father's records.

41:55.871 --> 41:57.836
- That's my sister.
- Your sister?

41:57.838 --> 41:59.872
(whispers) She's adopted.

41:59.874 --> 42:01.575
Aaah!

42:03.711 --> 42:06.812
(broken English) Oh. Oh, Rory MacLachlan.

42:06.814 --> 42:08.314
So cool in Japan.

42:08.316 --> 42:10.716
No, he's not. I looked it up.

42:10.718 --> 42:13.086
(slurping)

42:13.088 --> 42:15.954
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>The mark of a
good con is not how much money you make.</i>

42:15.956 --> 42:18.325
<i>It's how clean you get away.</i>

42:20.996 --> 42:24.064
Well, you broke it, you bought it.

42:24.066 --> 42:27.468

<i>♪ Just as long as you

42:33.742 --> 42:36.075
- It would have worked.
- Don't worry about it.

42:36.077 --> 42:39.044
- I've seen worse.
- You've seen worse?

42:39.046 --> 42:40.979
No, not really. (laughing)

42:40.981 --> 42:42.648
Oh, my God.

42:42.650 --> 42:47.954
PROFESSOR: Don't despair, Lawrence,
my boy. You've made a great beginning.

42:47.956 --> 42:50.256
Oh, my first con.

LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>The
Professor loved to play poker.</i>

43:02.269 --> 43:05.437
<i>Even more, he loved
to cheat at poker.</i>

43:05.439 --> 43:10.008
<i>After all, poker is a game
designed to be played by liars.</i>

43:10.010 --> 43:15.048
The ultimate form of the lie is the bluff.

43:15.050 --> 43:19.318
Bluffing turns a game of chance

43:19.320 --> 43:21.789
into a game of skill.

43:27.329 --> 43:30.930
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>But that's not the
only reason the Professor loved poker.</i>

43:30.932 --> 43:36.102
<i>As far as I could tell, it was across
a poker table that he met... her.</i>

43:36.104 --> 43:40.039
WOMAN: <i>♪ In my
foolish lover's game ♪</i>

43:40.041 --> 43:43.276
<i>She was a small-time
cheat, a peeker.</i>

43:43.278 --> 43:45.812
<i>She used shiners, tiny mirrors,</i>

43:45.814 --> 43:49.284
<i>to get a glimpse of the
cards as they were dealt.</i>

43:52.086 --> 43:54.922
<i>It's easy to spot if you
know what to look for.</i>

43:55.990 --> 43:58.258
<i>The Professor did
know what to look for,</i>

43:58.260 --> 44:01.830
<i>but he also liked what he saw.</i>

44:04.532 --> 44:07.367
<i>The Professor was mucking back then,</i>

44:07.369 --> 44:10.305
<i>introducing foreign
cards into a game.</i>

44:11.872 --> 44:14.340
<i>He was good,</i>

44:14.342 --> 44:16.175
<i>but so was she.</i>

44:16.177 --> 44:19.211
<i>Or maybe he tipped his hand.</i>

44:19.213 --> 44:21.481
<i>They became partners.</i>

44:21.483 --> 44:23.883
<i>More than partners.</i>

44:23.885 --> 44:25.885
<i>And together, they became readers.</i>

44:25.887 --> 44:29.488
Readers use a marked deck.

44:29.490 --> 44:33.325
On the back of the cards are
tiny dots or hidden patterns.

44:33.327 --> 44:37.229
Readers switch the
honest deck for their own.

44:37.231 --> 44:40.534
This is called cooling the deck.

44:44.405 --> 44:48.173
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>Together, they
could take on bigger rooms, higher stakes.</i>

44:48.175 --> 44:51.544
<i>But cooling the deck
is a dangerous game.</i>

44:51.546 --> 44:54.314
<i>If someone suspects another
player of being a reader,</i>

44:54.316 --> 44:57.886
<i>all he needs to do

01:06:01.148 --> 01:06:03.682
Love.

01:06:03.684 --> 01:06:06.787
It can make a man do things...

01:06:07.854 --> 01:06:10.754
things he will later regret.

01:06:10.756 --> 01:06:13.390
I don't think the Professor's
ever likely to forgive you.

01:06:13.392 --> 01:06:17.129
Sour old bastard got
what was coming to him.

01:06:17.131 --> 01:06:21.666
I'm talking about that little baby girl.

01:06:21.668 --> 01:06:24.037
My daughter.

01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:30.642
That's right.

01:06:30.644 --> 01:06:34.546
He hasn't told you that, has he?

01:06:34.548 --> 01:06:36.481
So, Lawrence,

01:06:36.483 --> 01:06:39.686
is my secret safe with you?

01:06:42.622 --> 01:06:44.957
May the best man win.

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.510
Hey, stop!

01:07:39.512 --> 01:07:40.979
Lawrence? What are you doing here?

01:07:40.981 --> 01:07:44.416
You're in serious trouble. She's only 17.

01:07:44.418 --> 01:07:47.251
I'm afraid the only course of
action available to me, sir,

01:07:47.253 --> 01:07:48.852
is to contact your family.

01:07:48.854 --> 01:07:51.689
- No, Lawrence!
- That is, of course, unless

01:07:51.691 --> 01:07:54.894
you can think of another
way we can sort this out.

01:07:55.996 --> 01:07:57.629
(grunting)

01:07:57.631 --> 01:08:00.564
Get off him!

01:08:00.566 --> 01:08:01.966
(wheezes)

01:08:01.968 --> 01:08:04.401
LAWRENCE (narrating):
<i>It's all fun and games</i>

01:08:04.403 --> 01:08:08.340
<i>until someone loses an eye.</i>

01:08:08.342 --> 01:08:11.508
- Sarah...
- Shut up.

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:13.613
Here.

01:08:22.723 --> 01:08:25.923
Nothing broken.

01:08:25.925 --> 01:08:29.394
I've never been in a fight
before. It really hurts.

01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:31.764
No shit.

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:41.971
I was trying to be normal for one night.

01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:44.774
Sorry.

01:08:44.777 --> 01:08:47.611
You shouldn't have followed me.

01:08:47.613 --> 01:08:50.017
Just looking out for a friend.

01:08:51.684 --> 01:08:55.051
Lawrence, you're not my friend.

01:08:55.054 --> 01:08:58.689
I told you, we don't make
friends. It's not what we do.

01:08:58.692 --> 01:09:02.026
It's just Dad and me.

01:09:02.028 --> 01:09:04.330
He's... not...

01:09:06.966 --> 01:09:09.368
He's not here.

01:09:11.804 --> 01:09:14.340
You'll never be one of us.

01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:18.077
That's why I trust you.

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:25.550
We can do this, Lawrence.

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:27.920
We have to. We can leave him.

01:09:30.357 --> 01:09:32.359
Together.

01:09:48.974 --> 01:09:50.707
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>I
know I look confident,</i>

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:53.212
<i>but I got pretty good at pretending.</i>

01:09:55.048 --> 01:09:57.916
<i>But pretending is just another lie,</i>

01:09:57.918 --> 01:10:02.089
<i>and the Cook's Game
was the real thing.</i>

01:10:03.423 --> 01:10:05.492
(clears throat)

01:10:07.594 --> 01:10:09.961
You look great, Dad.

01:10:09.963 --> 01:10:11.732
Hmm.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.737
This is it, Lawrence,
my boy. (clears throat)

01:10:18.671 --> 01:10:21.006
I'll see you there.

01:10:22.075 --> 01:10:24.745
Do me proud.

01:10:31.384 --> 01:10:34.186
(door opens, closes)

01:10:45.098 --> 01:10:48.565
Don't move your eyes to the
right when you're bluffing.

01:10:48.567 --> 01:10:51.770
That's my tell? It's that obvious?

01:10:51.772 --> 01:10:53.605
Why couldn't I see it?

01:10:53.607 --> 01:10:56.443
Think about it.

01:10:58.778 --> 01:11:02.314
(chuckles) You can't see
your eyes moving in a mirror.

01:11:18.497 --> 01:11:22.167
Time to go, Hamlet.

01:11:22.169 --> 01:11:24.135

Oh, you're younger than I expected.

01:12:29.268 --> 01:12:32.504
Welcome to the game. Please, take a seat.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.176
I don't recognize you, kid.

01:12:38.178 --> 01:12:41.044
Where do you normally play?

01:12:41.046 --> 01:12:44.918
Shanghai. Macau, sometimes.
My father's casino.

01:12:46.052 --> 01:12:50.687
I like him. If the kid pays, the kid plays.

01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:53.224
Macau?

01:12:53.226 --> 01:12:54.993
(Chinese)

01:12:54.995 --> 01:12:58.031
Sorry. I don't speak Cantonese.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.202
Only Mandarin.

01:13:05.237 --> 01:13:07.539
(door opens)

01:13:09.942 --> 01:13:13.744
Gentlemen, some of you
may have met Mr. Riley.

01:13:13.746 --> 01:13:16.748
Two-time winner of the game.

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.284
You've met Rashid.

01:13:19.286 --> 01:13:24.955
This is Alex Elmsley, Jeremy Fong and...

01:13:24.957 --> 01:13:28.959
Hello, Vernon. How's
that little girl of yours?

01:13:28.961 --> 01:13:31.962
Please, Mr. Riley. Keep it nice.

01:13:31.964 --> 01:13:35.233
All friends here, Alice.

01:13:35.235 --> 01:13:37.200
Now... (cracks knuckles)

01:13:37.202 --> 01:13:40.473
let's play some fucking cards.

01:14:00.693 --> 01:14:03.860
<i>♪ You ain't gonna

LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>Poker is a
game designed to be played by liars.</i>

01:14:09.134 --> 01:14:11.069
<i>But not all liars are equal.</i>

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:13.904
What about you, Professor?

01:14:13.906 --> 01:14:16.841
Have you grown a pair?

01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:19.377
Two pair actually. (chuckles)

01:14:19.379 --> 01:14:22.779
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>The
inexperienced pretends to have skill.</i>

01:14:22.781 --> 01:14:24.815
<i>The skillful pretends to be green.</i>

01:14:24.817 --> 01:14:26.751
Screw you, kid.

01:14:26.753 --> 01:14:29.153
<i>And so we control the cards.</i>

01:14:29.155 --> 01:14:33.526
<i>The only variables
are the other players.</i>

01:14:37.129 --> 01:14:39.698
Motherfucker!

01:14:41.367 --> 01:14:43.801
Something to remember me by.

01:14:43.803 --> 01:14:46.236
Riley!

01:14:46.238 --> 01:14:48.006
Get him out of here.

LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>Ladies and
gentlemen, the Little Red Riding Hood game.</i>

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.287
<i>The Professor stacks his chips dirty</i>

01:15:03.289 --> 01:15:05.791
<i>to tell me Rashid's number is up.</i>

01:15:06.992 --> 01:15:09.927
<i>First, I signal what cards I have.</i>

01:15:09.929 --> 01:15:12.198
<i>This card is a queen.</i>

01:15:14.034 --> 01:15:18.002
<i>He goes rabbit-hunting in the
muck to get the cards we need.</i>

01:15:18.004 --> 01:15:21.873
<i>Then he goes south
to stack the deck.</i>

01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:24.909
<i>He false shuffles with a
push-through or an up-the-ladder</i>

01:15:24.911 --> 01:15:27.580
<i>so the deck stays stacked.</i>

01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:31.382
<i>He crimps the bottom card
before he gives the deck</i>

01:15:31.384 --> 01:15:34.154
<i>to the next player to cut.</i>

01:15:36.822 --> 01:15:40.325
<i>And a classic pass gets
the cards back in order.</i>

01:15:49.768 --> 01:15:51.935
(clears throat)

01:15:51.937 --> 01:15:55.607
<i>With the cowboys we dealt
him, he has to take the bait.</i>

01:16:10.255 --> 01:16:13.356
<i>The flop turns both
pairs into trips.</i>

01:16:13.358 --> 01:16:16.159
<i>And right now, his three kings</i>

01:16:16.161 --> 01:16:18.395
<i>beat my three queens.</i>

01:16:18.397 --> 01:16:22.735
<i>Three kings... the
Christmas special.</i>

01:16:28.974 --> 01:16:32.409
<i>The Professor bottom
deals, and there she is.</i>

01:16:32.411 --> 01:16:35.512
<i>Rashid's money card.</i>

01:16:35.514 --> 01:16:39.283
<i>Now he has the boat.
Kings over queens.</i>

01:16:39.285 --> 01:16:42.255
<i>Almost nothing beats a full house.</i>

01:16:47.026 --> 01:16:49.295
<i>Almost.</i>

01:17:00.072 --> 01:17:01.939
<i>Four queens.</i>

01:17:01.941 --> 01:17:03.775
<i>The Village People.</i>

01:17:03.777 --> 01:17:07.247
(foreign language)

01:17:18.791 --> 01:17:20.824
(lighter flicks open)

01:17:20.826 --> 01:17:23.427
LAWRENCE (narrating): <i>Con
men don't play games.</i>

01:17:23.429 --> 01:17:25.698
<i>They play people.</i>

01:17:27.232 --> 01:17:30.168
<i>And people are unpredictable.</i>

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:35.172
To be honest with you,
they were happier times.

01:17:35.174 --> 01:17:37.744
Salad days. (chuckles)

01:17:39.946 --> 01:17:42.649
I remember them with affection.

01:17:44.384 --> 01:17:46.519
I remember differently.

01:17:49.822 --> 01:17:53.423
You've done a really good
job with Sarah, you know.

01:17:53.425 --> 01:17:58.895
She's a beautiful woman,
just like her mother.

01:17:58.897 --> 01:18:01.900
Though she has my eyes.

01:18:06.205 --> 01:18:10.106
She's nothing like her mother.

01:18:10.108 --> 01:18:12.877
Really?

01:18:12.879 --> 01:18:17.916
When she finds a man who gives
her what you can't, she's gone.

01:18:30.263 --> 01:18:32.732
ALICE: Hey!

01:18:35.567 --> 01:18:39.805
It's only cheating when you
get caught, right, Professor?

01:18:41.073 --> 01:18:43.442
ALICE: Get him out of here.

01:18:51.651 --> 01:18:55.521
I trust that no one else
will insult the house.

01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:00.892
She left me too, you know.

01:19:01.995 --> 01:19:04.361
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.

01:19:04.363 --> 01:19:06.564
I was the card player,

01:19:06.566 --> 01:19:09.035
but she was a better liar.

01:19:14.072 --> 01:19:17.776
What are you doing here, kid?

01:19:20.379 --> 01:19:23.213
I mean, really,

01:19:23.215 --> 01:19:26.518
what the hell are you doing here?

01:19:40.566 --> 01:19:42.969
You sure about that?

01:19:45.204 --> 01:19:48.172
(chuckling)

01:19:48.174 --> 01:19:50.675
Yes. Don't feel bad.

01:19:50.677 --> 01:19:52.944
Honesty.

01:19:52.946 --> 01:19:55.081
It's a good quality.

01:20:11.397 --> 01:20:13.599

I can't do this.

It's our only chance.

01:21:17.263 --> 01:21:20.398
I wrote a letter.

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.567
I should take it in.

01:21:25.103 --> 01:21:27.005
I'll do it.

Back in a minute.

01:22:00.807 --> 01:22:03.742
- She finally did it.
- Shit!

01:22:05.344 --> 01:22:08.412
My little girl's grown up.

01:22:08.414 --> 01:22:11.148
She's on her own. Good girl.

01:22:11.150 --> 01:22:12.650
Not on her own.

01:22:12.652 --> 01:22:15.485
We planned it together.

01:22:15.487 --> 01:22:20.291
This note, it's for you.

01:22:20.293 --> 01:22:23.427
I think you'll find, my dear boy,

01:22:23.429 --> 01:22:25.465
it's for you.

01:22:47.385 --> 01:22:50.253
<i>the suckers rope themselves.</i>

01:22:50.255 --> 01:22:53.925
Listen, anyway, we've
got your wallet, so...

01:22:56.495 --> 01:22:59.197
To no fucking friends at all.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.434
We can do this, Lawrence.

01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:05.938
We have to. We can leave him.

01:23:09.674 --> 01:23:12.810
I wrote a letter.

01:23:12.812 --> 01:23:15.747
I should take it in.

01:23:19.384 --> 01:23:21.252
SARAH'S VOICE: <i>I'm sorry
for leaving like this,</i>

01:23:21.254 --> 01:23:23.319
<i>but it's all I know how to do.</i>

01:23:23.321 --> 01:23:26.222
<i>I can imagine how you'll feel,</i>

01:23:26.224 --> 01:23:28.324
<i>but I just couldn't face good-bye.</i>

01:23:28.326 --> 01:23:30.493
<i>Not with you.</i>

01:23:30.495 --> 01:23:33.663
<i>You know what they
say... "lucky at cards."</i>

01:23:33.665 --> 01:23:35.498
<i>(chuckles)</i>

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.836
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

01:23:38.838 --> 01:23:41.504
<i>Say good-bye to him for me.</i>

01:23:41.506 --> 01:23:44.475
"I will miss you and think of you often.

01:23:44.477 --> 01:23:47.647
Love always, Sarah."

01:23:56.455 --> 01:24:00.724
You were great out there tonight, my boy.

01:24:00.726 --> 01:24:02.961
You're a real player.

01:24:04.429 --> 01:24:06.462
- I let the team down.
- But...

01:24:06.464 --> 01:24:09.699
The better man won.

01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:11.467
Aren't you angry?

01:24:11.469 --> 01:24:15.538
(sighs) I'd have given
it to her if she'd asked.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.576
It's only money.

01:24:18.945 --> 01:24:22.279
Mine's a dying art, my boy.

01:24:22.281 --> 01:24:25.916
An art of grace and tact.

01:24:25.918 --> 01:24:30.221
Nowadays, a chap in a suit
can hit some keys in a machine

01:24:30.223 --> 01:24:31.955
and rob honest people of millions

01:24:31.957 --> 01:24:34.326
without even lookin' 'em in the eye.

01:24:35.628 --> 01:24:38.828
We trick people into giving us money.

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.931
We make them dishonest.

01:24:41.933 --> 01:24:45.502
They're dishonest to begin with.

01:24:45.504 --> 01:24:47.773
Even you.

01:25:10.263 --> 01:25:12.629
Chinese lucky money?

01:25:12.631 --> 01:25:14.297
You might need it.

01:25:14.299 --> 01:25:17.267
How about you?

01:25:17.269 --> 01:25:19.638
I'll be fine.

01:25:23.808 --> 01:25:27.711
You saw it coming, right? This is
a con movie, you said to yourself,

01:25:27.713 --> 01:25:30.681
and all con movies end with a scam.

01:25:30.683 --> 01:25:32.416
Well, you're right.

01:25:32.418 --> 01:25:34.651
But even though it does end with a scam,

01:25:34.653 --> 01:25:36.654
this isn't a con movie.

01:25:36.656 --> 01:25:38.721
This is my life.

01:25:38.723 --> 01:25:40.759
(voices rewinding)

01:25:46.064 --> 01:25:50.700
(breathing deeply) I can't do this.

01:25:50.702 --> 01:25:53.870
- Sarah, listen...
- No, Lawrence, you don't understand.

01:25:53.872 --> 01:25:57.076
I was going to leave you both.

01:25:59.344 --> 01:26:02.346
I'm sorry.

01:26:02.348 --> 01:26:05.017
I didn't know what to do.

01:26:15.594 --> 01:26:17.260
Sarah.

01:26:17.262 --> 01:26:21.998
Children grow up and leave their
parents. It's what's supposed to happen.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.271
He just needs to know
he's been a father to you.

01:26:27.439 --> 01:26:30.976
(inhales, exhales)

01:26:32.445 --> 01:26:35.546
But what about you?

01:26:35.548 --> 01:26:38.015
You're the only friend I've ever had.

01:27:03.776 --> 01:27:06.510
but I just couldn't face good-bye.

01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:09.113
Not... Not with you.

01:27:09.115 --> 01:27:15.054
You know what they say... 'lucky at cards.'

01:27:16.955 --> 01:27:19.324
Thank you for everything.

01:27:20.492 --> 01:27:23.092
Say good-bye to him for me.

01:27:23.094 --> 01:27:26.096
I will miss you

01:27:26.098 --> 01:27:28.399

01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:31.036

01:27:36.075 --> 01:27:39.943
You were great out there tonight, my boy.

01:27:39.945 --> 01:27:42.111

01:27:42.113 --> 01:27:44.715

01:27:44.717 --> 01:27:46.883
No, the better man won.

01:27:46.885 --> 01:27:48.851
No.

01:27:48.853 --> 01:27:52.422
He might be the better mechanic,
but you're the better man.

01:27:52.424 --> 01:27:57.060
You raised her, even though
you knew she was his daughter.

01:27:57.062 --> 01:27:59.829
You gave her a life.

01:27:59.831 --> 01:28:02.468
You were her father.

01:28:06.539 --> 01:28:11.675
(chuckles, sniffs)

01:28:11.677 --> 01:28:14.513

01:28:23.022 --> 01:28:25.655
Thanks.

01:28:25.657 --> 01:28:27.459
But I'm going home.

01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:31.095
Hmm.

01:28:36.768 --> 01:28:39.204
Chinese lucky money.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.207
