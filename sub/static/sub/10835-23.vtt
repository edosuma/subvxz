00:02.419 --> 00:04.171
Previously on 90210:
Your father called us yesterday.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.380
My stepdad.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.548
He requested your records.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.759
He's looking
at military schools.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.260
I'm in a bit of a pinch
financially.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.470
I went through a lot of money
very quickly.

00:11.595 --> 00:12.721
I'm glad to help.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.431
I got, like, 20 cases of beer

00:14.556 --> 00:16.600
and Topher's brother brought
over vodka, gin, whisky,

00:16.725 --> 00:20.103
bourbon...
Thank you, Phoebe Abrams.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.940
I am really stoked
about the afterprom party

00:23.064 --> 00:25.192
at Phoebe Abrams's house
tonight. I will be there

00:25.317 --> 00:26.276
with the Beverly Hills
Police Department.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.278
Who the hell told him?

00:28.403 --> 00:29.613
I know who it was.

00:29.738 --> 00:30.781
Why did you tell your dad
about my party?

00:30.906 --> 00:32.115
Is that what everyone thinks?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.367
They don't think. They know.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.702
You're a rat.

00:34.827 --> 00:38.330
The sophomore prom queen
is Erin Silver.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.581
I don't know exactly who I am.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.416
But I do know
who I am not.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.795
Some weird zombie
prom-loving loser.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.171
Why did you get me this corsage?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.423
You looked in my Facebook
page, didn't you?

00:48.549 --> 00:49.717
You like me.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.677
Dude, I'm so sick
of looking at you.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.639
Navid! My water just broke.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.349
I think I'm going into labor.

01:03.647 --> 01:04.940
(camera shutters clicking)

01:07.150 --> 01:10.111
Oh, I'm definitely
getting some tonight.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.740
So, anyway, his dad left
when he was a kid.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.909
It was just Liam and his mom
against the world.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.745
She was a housekeeper
for this billionaire family
out in Long Island.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.496
Whatever. Long story short.

01:19.621 --> 01:23.333
Last year, Liam walked in on the
billionaire screwing his mom.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.793
Oh, how awful.
I know. Right?

01:24.919 --> 01:26.712
Then she marries the guy.

01:26.837 --> 01:27.963
Turns out he's
a complete son of a bitch.

01:28.087 --> 01:31.717
I mean, no wonder
Liam has trust issues.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.844
Uh-huh.
Are you listening to me?

01:33.969 --> 01:37.681
Absolutely. Liam sounds great.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.558
You had me at trust issues.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.809
No, Jen.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.061
You don't get it.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.480
Tonight, everything changed.
Everything.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.440
Well, honey, that's great.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.734
Naomi!

01:48.859 --> 01:50.193
Total emergency.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.695
Not only has my party
been ruined,

01:51.820 --> 01:53.697
thanks to Principal Loser,

01:53.822 --> 01:55.449
but now nobody's stepping up
and they're...

01:55.574 --> 01:57.242
Uh, and that's a good thing

01:57.367 --> 01:58.368
since afterproms
are highly illegal

01:58.493 --> 02:00.454
and will lead to suspension,

02:00.579 --> 02:01.956
which will lead
to missing finals,

02:02.081 --> 02:03.457
which will lead
to summer school.

02:03.582 --> 02:04.917
Did you fall on your head?

02:05.042 --> 02:07.586
What? Oh. Jen's not a grown-up.

02:07.711 --> 02:08.669
She's my sister.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.714
Jen, Phoebe. Phoebe, Jen.
Hey.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.173
Hi.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.425
Um, Jake Manditsky said

02:13.550 --> 02:15.052
that he could have the party
at his house, but then

02:15.176 --> 02:17.345
his parents said at the last
second that they're not going

02:17.471 --> 02:19.098
to their beach
house and now...
Oh.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.308
Oh. Well, there's no parents
at my house. I'll throw it.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.852
I don't think so.

02:23.978 --> 02:27.439
Sweetie, I'm sorry, but
there's no way I'm going to have

02:27.564 --> 02:29.066
a bunch of high school kids
trashing my house,

02:29.190 --> 02:31.735
spilling beer all over
my furniture and

02:31.860 --> 02:33.862
vomit wine coolers
on my rugs.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.739
It's actually my furniture

02:35.864 --> 02:38.366
and they're my rugs
since I'm paying for everything.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.662
What's that supposed to mean?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.580
In fact,
since I'm the only one

02:43.705 --> 02:45.332
paying rent,
it's actually my house.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.003
If I feel like throwing
a party at my house,

02:49.128 --> 02:51.421
I'm going to throw a party
at my house.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.381
(laughing)

02:53.507 --> 02:55.342
But you are
more than welcome to come.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.431
You don't want
to do this, Naomi.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.517
So...

03:03.642 --> 03:05.560
Let's do it!

03:07.688 --> 03:09.397
NAOMI:
Afterprom party at my house.
Spread the word.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.359
Hey.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.529
Party at 174 West Hollybrook.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.031
Penelope!

03:17.156 --> 03:19.741
Party at my house tonight.
Keep it on the D.L.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.785
Benedict Annie is right there.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.829
Drop it, Penelope.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.372
Annie's not the one who told.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.502
Don't worry about her or them.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.130
I like that wrap,
by the way.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.548
You look really good tonight.
I mean, like a model--

03:34.673 --> 03:36.383
a really, really short model,

03:36.508 --> 03:37.801
like, a regular model
standing in the distance--

03:37.926 --> 03:39.469
but you look good.
Well, thank you, Naomi.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.721
Oh, my God.
Everyone who's anyone

03:40.846 --> 03:42.097
is going to be
at my party tonight.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.348
(cell phone ringing)
Oh, my God.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.517
What?
Ade just went into labor.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.019
Oh, my God.

03:47.144 --> 03:47.936
Oh, I have to get
to the hospital.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.396
Yeah.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.272
Please, you have
to take care of my house.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.691
You have to be the hostess.

03:52.816 --> 03:53.817
Make sure that nobody vomits
wine coolers on the rugs, okay?

03:53.942 --> 03:54.902
Absolutely. Don't worry.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.404
Thank you so much.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.530
Okay, I got to go.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.824
Go. Go, go, go.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.368
Oh, is this it?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.495
No, wait. Ours had
different rims than this one.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.832
Man, is it just me, or do most
limos look very similar?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.291
We'll find it.
Eventually.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.669
Yo, congratulations, prom king.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.213
Thanks.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.005
Dixon, why do you have
to be like that?

04:16.130 --> 04:18.591
You can be enjoying
the fact that you won.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.885
Whatever.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.803
What does that mean?
Nothing.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.764
It's just hard to enjoy
something

04:23.889 --> 04:25.015
when your girlfriend
thinks it's stupid.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.475
Guys, guys!
Adrianna is having her baby.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.602
Now?
Yeah. Navid is with her

04:28.727 --> 04:30.896
and Naomi is going to meet her
at the hospital.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.647
We've got to get to Naomi's

04:32.773 --> 04:33.774
'cause I promised that I would
take care of her house,

04:33.899 --> 04:34.983
and there's, like, 200 people
on their way there now.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.610
We got to hurry, guys.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.736
All right,
but the only problem is

04:37.861 --> 04:39.029
someone stole our limo.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.447
Navid and Adrianna
probably took it.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.700
Hey! Yo, Duncan.
Can we get a ride, man?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.744
Yeah, no problem, man.
Hop aboard the white stallion.

04:45.869 --> 04:46.912
You are the man, D.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.373
Wait!
She's coming?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.708
I don't want that
rat in our limo.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.835
Phoebe, I swear
I didn't tell anyone

04:53.961 --> 04:55.003
about your party, okay?
I swear.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.047
Come on, Pheebs, be a sport.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.966
They need a lift.
Yeah, if you could
just drive me

04:59.091 --> 05:01.885
to my house, I could get my car.
It would be so great.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.428
Fine. Just don't talk
to me or look at me.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.639
Honestly, Phoebe?
You're talking and looking.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.350
Thank you.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.436
Sorry I have to abandon you.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.980
I mean, on prom night
and everything.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.481
Don't worry about it.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.941
I'll see you later tonight.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.776
You'll go to the party?

05:20.487 --> 05:21.863
Well, it's your party.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.697
Of course I'm going.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.709
You know what's crazy?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.170
What's that?

05:36.295 --> 05:40.132
My mom has been sending me to
this therapist for months now.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.426
This chick costs $200 an hour,
and I've barely said

05:43.551 --> 05:45.804
five words to her.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.765
I spend one night with you,

05:48.890 --> 05:51.350
I end up telling you
my whole life story.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.692
Well, 500 bucks,
we'll call it even.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.485
(both chuckle)

06:02.361 --> 06:04.948
This probably goes
without saying,

06:05.073 --> 06:07.117
but that stuff that I said--

06:07.242 --> 06:08.660
that was private.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.579
Of course.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.583
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.045
Cool.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.843
BOY:
Come on, man. Move the car.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.929
Oh, finally.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.597
GIRL:
Go!

06:34.769 --> 06:36.855
Oh, my Lord!
That is just crazy talk.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.439
Excuse me?
Yeah, I thought so.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.733
I told Karen I thought so.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.068
Ma'am, this is pretty urgent.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.443
What's the matter, kid?

06:42.569 --> 06:43.904
You get in a fight
on prom night?

06:44.029 --> 06:45.280
Well, I feel your pain,

06:45.404 --> 06:47.782
but it's not urgent, okay?
So take a seat

06:47.908 --> 06:48.700
and I'll get to you
when I get to you.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.409
Anyway.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.619
What?
She said
I never said a word to her,

06:51.745 --> 06:53.205
which is ridiculous...

06:53.330 --> 06:55.582
(Adrianna moaning)
'cause I can remember
the exact second I told her.

06:55.707 --> 06:56.958
Oh, my God, Navid,
what is taking so long?

06:57.084 --> 07:00.879
My girlfriend
is having a baby!

07:01.004 --> 07:02.923
Oh. She's having a baby?

07:03.048 --> 07:03.965
Yes, she's
having a baby.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.634
Yeah, I am having a baby.

covered raisins on top.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.430
Diabetic coma.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.764
You think I should lose
the yogurt raisins?

07:52.889 --> 07:53.932
Yeah, that's the problem.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.643
Who knew you were
such a sugar fiend?

07:56.768 --> 07:58.853
What can I say? It's the
only vice I have left.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.230
Left, really?

08:00.355 --> 08:01.689
What vices did you have?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.900
A huge barbecue chicken problem.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.860
But that's a conversation
for another time,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.946
when there aren't so many
impressionable minds around.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.824
Sounds intriguing.

08:10.949 --> 08:11.992
(holding final note)

08:12.117 --> 08:13.452
(applauding)
All right!

08:13.576 --> 08:15.996
Let's give it up
for the Wildcat Crooners.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.580
Hey, hon!
Hey!

08:17.705 --> 08:19.040
Will you save my spot in line?
Yes.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.959
So, what do you think?

08:21.084 --> 08:24.879
Oh, it's great. Everyone looks
like they're having so much fun.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.589
Yes, they are.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.301
Hey, how come you're not
wearing your T-shirt?

08:29.426 --> 08:32.011
Oh, shoot. I completely forgot.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.929
(both laughing)
Hey!

08:34.054 --> 08:35.349
Hey, what are you doing?
You lost our place in line.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.890
I just a text.
Adrianna is in labor.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.527
(cheering)

09:00.165 --> 09:02.334
Oh, guys!

09:11.885 --> 09:14.179
Ow! Ow!

09:15.389 --> 09:16.764
What on earth
are you doing down there?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.059
I'm cleaning. Naomi asked me

09:19.184 --> 09:21.395
to keep an eye
on the house.
Unbelievable.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.355
She throws this party,
and she's not even here.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.774
What are you looking at?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.902
If you're supposed
to be cleaning, clean.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.449
I'm going outside to resist
taking up smoking again.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.794
Hmm?
It's never easy.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.964
Me and Silver-- it...

09:50.090 --> 09:52.175
I don't know.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.302
Relationships are work.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.054
That's what they
always say, right, man?

09:56.179 --> 09:57.764
Well, this one
is a lot of work.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.600
I mean, sometimes
I just wish I had

10:00.725 --> 10:04.187
a regular high school girlfriend
who liked stuff like prom

10:04.312 --> 10:05.646
and going to see her
boyfriend play lacrosse

10:05.772 --> 10:07.941
and didn't think walking
on the Third Street Promenade

10:08.066 --> 10:10.151
meant she was a
consumerist sellout.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.405
Silver isn't easy, man.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.739
Of course not.
I mean, who wants

10:14.864 --> 10:17.242
some boring regular
high school girl? I mean,

10:17.367 --> 10:19.244
Silver's got spirit

10:19.369 --> 10:20.954
and attitude.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.039
Life-force.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.749
You know?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.962
All I mean is...

10:29.087 --> 10:30.922
I think you and Silver
are great.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.925
And everything worth anything

10:34.050 --> 10:36.386
just takes work
and patience.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.973
Yeah, yeah.
I hear you, man.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.101
But what can I
do? I mean...

10:43.226 --> 10:46.563
I love her, man.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.022
I mean, when she's
across the room,

10:48.148 --> 10:50.358
I miss her.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.068
You know, speaking of which,

10:52.193 --> 10:53.694
I'm going to go see how
she's doing, all right?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.738
Go, man.

10:55.863 --> 10:56.864
(sighing)

11:13.632 --> 11:15.425
I'm going to run to Adrianna's
room. Can you hold this?

11:15.550 --> 11:17.177
Sure, okay.
We'll wait here.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.262
I can't believe we haven't heard
from Annie or Dixon.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.555
Well, I'm sure
they're on their way.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.098
Hey, where'd you get those,
Piglet?

11:22.223 --> 11:25.935
I may have snuck them out
of the Postprom-A-Palooza.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.937
Come on. Share.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.272
After the Piglet dig?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.107
Okay.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.900
Oh, thank you!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.819
Mmm.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.821
Mmm!

11:36.946 --> 11:38.697
(screaming)

11:46.247 --> 11:49.459
I'm not ready.
It's too soon.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.460
I'm supposed
to have three more weeks.

11:50.585 --> 11:51.794
It's going to be okay.

11:51.919 --> 11:52.920
Greg and Leslie
aren't even here yet.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.047
They're getting a flight.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.089
They'll be here at 5:00 a.m.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.341
Get Ty. I need him

11:56.466 --> 11:57.716
to sign that parental waiver.
He hasn't signed it yet.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.302
I will call him.
I will get him down here.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.054
Have you called my mom?

12:01.179 --> 12:02.847
She's on her way back
from your aunt's.
She'll be here soon, okay?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.891
I don't even have a toothbrush.

12:05.016 --> 12:05.975
Don't worry. Your breath
doesn't smell that gross.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.101
Kelly!

12:07.227 --> 12:08.353
Did you get a hold of Brenda?

12:08.478 --> 12:09.812
No. I left her a message.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.481
She must still be in China.

12:11.606 --> 12:12.399
What is she doing in China?

12:12.524 --> 12:14.484
She's supposed to be here.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.902
It's too soon.

12:16.027 --> 12:16.944
See? I'm not ready.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.112
Nothing is ready.
(alarm beeping)

12:18.238 --> 12:20.823
Calm down.
What's that?
What's happening?

12:20.948 --> 12:21.824
I don't know.

12:21.949 --> 12:22.992
The baby's heart
rate's dropping.

12:23.117 --> 12:23.993
What does that mean?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.161
We need to do a C-section now.

12:25.286 --> 12:25.995
Just stay calm.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.249
Navid...

12:29.374 --> 12:30.208
what's happening?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.877
You're gonna be okay.
Navid!

12:33.002 --> 12:34.879
Navid?!
Just go.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.181
Hey, watch the jackets!

12:45.306 --> 12:46.600
And go!
Go!

12:48.142 --> 12:49.810
Oh! Oh!

12:50.353 --> 12:52.063
Ryan...

12:52.188 --> 12:54.566
(drinkers gasping)

12:58.403 --> 13:00.154
What are you doing?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.365
It's you...

13:02.490 --> 13:05.076
erupting like a volcano.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.037
Is the lava not reading?

13:09.456 --> 13:12.417
Hmm. Maybe I need to do
some more crosshatching.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.554
She's beautiful.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.016
Do you want to hold her?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.438
Come on, Ade. Just take a look.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.023
No, Navid.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.984
Ade...

13:44.240 --> 13:45.617
Just take her out of here.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.955
Okay.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.458
(baby fussing)

13:53.583 --> 13:55.084
Just get some rest, okay?

13:58.379 --> 13:59.714
(baby fussing)

14:00.674 --> 14:02.841
NAVID:
Shh...

14:14.020 --> 14:16.105
(baby fussing)

14:25.532 --> 14:27.492
Hi.
Hey.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.284
It's a girl.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.494
(both exclaim)

14:29.619 --> 14:31.162
She's great. Healthy.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.497
Six pounds, two ounces.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.915
18 inches.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.167
How's Ade?

14:36.292 --> 14:38.503
She's, uh, good. She's...

14:38.628 --> 14:40.087
she's fine.
She's resting.
Can we see the baby?

14:40.213 --> 14:41.255
Yeah, sure.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.465
She's down the hallway
in the nursery.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.091
I'll go with you guys.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.593
Hey, Navid, quick question.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.178
Do you know where Dixon and,

14:47.303 --> 14:48.471
and, uh...

14:48.596 --> 14:50.014
Annie.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.183
Annie. Do you know
where Annie and Dixon are?

14:52.308 --> 14:53.267
Me? No.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.227
You don't think they're

14:54.352 --> 14:55.102
still at your house?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.937
My house?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.231
Oh, right, right, yeah.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.440
Uh, my house.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.192
They might be, yeah.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.278
I'm gonna go see
the baby, okay?

15:07.532 --> 15:08.449
Clearly, they lie.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.284
Looks like it.
Do you really think

15:10.410 --> 15:11.452
they went to an
afterprom party?

15:11.578 --> 15:12.620
Yes. They must have.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.996
Well, how are we
gonna find them?

15:14.121 --> 15:15.039
They're not answering
their phones.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.290
I don't know.
Maybe we should

15:16.416 --> 15:17.625
get in the car
and drive around.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.293
Drive where?
I don't know.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.294
(yawning)

15:20.420 --> 15:21.713
(laughs)

15:21.838 --> 15:23.673
Oh, man, suddenly
I am so tired.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.132
Why are you laughing?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.593
Oh, my God,
the way you yawned!

15:26.718 --> 15:28.636
Like, like,
like a lion.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.220
(roars)
(laughs)

15:29.345 --> 15:33.349
(yawns)

15:33.474 --> 15:34.434
Did you just...

15:34.559 --> 15:36.185
(both laughing)

15:36.310 --> 15:37.395
I did!

15:37.520 --> 15:39.146
Did you just make
yourself yawn?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.440
I did!

15:40.565 --> 15:41.982
I did. Now you have
to try it.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.568
Come on. Try it.
Make yawn.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.323
Oh, man!

15:49.449 --> 15:50.241
I feel weird.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.242
Me, too.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.660
(laughing)

15:52.786 --> 15:54.995
Almost like I am stoned
or something.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.997
Yeah, that's how I feel.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.501
I-I keep losing
my train of thought

16:00.627 --> 16:03.337
and I have the munchies!

16:03.463 --> 16:05.423
(both laughing)

16:05.548 --> 16:08.426
Whoo!

16:08.551 --> 16:10.386
The brownies!

16:10.511 --> 16:12.179
(gasps)

16:12.305 --> 16:13.389
You think they were...?

16:13.514 --> 16:16.142
Pot brownies?

16:16.267 --> 16:18.185
Seriously?

16:21.564 --> 16:22.649
(both giggling)

16:22.774 --> 16:24.734
Oh, my God!

16:25.318 --> 16:26.986
Shh.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.616
Hey.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.534
Hi. Uh, where's Dixon?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.202
In the other room deejaying.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.246
Always the life
of the party.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.291
Can I ask you something?

16:40.416 --> 16:41.375
Sure.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.212
What do you think
about me and Dixon?

16:45.338 --> 16:49.467
I think both of you guys
are great.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.552
No, I mean, like,
as a couple?

16:51.678 --> 16:54.722
We're just so different.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.390
He's, like...

16:56.516 --> 16:58.267
prom royalty, you know?

16:58.392 --> 17:00.060
And I'm

17:00.186 --> 17:01.395
not.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.189
Actually, technically, you are.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.482
Come on.

17:04.607 --> 17:05.566
Is that who you think
I am,

17:05.692 --> 17:06.483
what, a prom queen?

17:06.608 --> 17:07.777
No, no,

17:07.902 --> 17:09.863
and I'm glad that you're not.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.617
Dixon

17:14.742 --> 17:16.452
loves you, Silver,

17:16.577 --> 17:18.663
and prom is like

17:18.788 --> 17:21.248
a once-a-year thing,
which means there are

17:21.374 --> 17:25.252
still 364 non-prom nights
where your differences

17:25.377 --> 17:27.253
won't seem so drastic.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.589
So you think we work?

17:28.715 --> 17:32.677
Yeah, I think you guys
make a great couple.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.095
(laughs)
Good.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.515
Okay, I just needed
to hear that.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.059
(both chuckle)

17:43.354 --> 17:45.648
Are you wearing Dixon's jacket?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.234
I bought him this boutonnière.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.529
You must have picked up
his jacket by mistake.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.656
Yeah, I guess.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.170
Ah... I got you, man.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.213
(chuckles)

18:09.338 --> 18:11.674
Hey, Dixon, I think

18:11.799 --> 18:14.052
we, uh, mixed up our jackets.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.638
Oh, uh, man, I knew
this felt a little tight.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.557
You know, with
my broad shoulders

18:19.682 --> 18:20.725
and everything.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.309
Yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

18:22.435 --> 18:23.436
Thanks, man.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.398
Hey, um,

18:27.523 --> 18:28.315
you want a song?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.359
Uh, no. No, man,

18:30.484 --> 18:31.736
you're doing great.
Good job, man.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.613
All right, thanks, man.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.699
(whispering):
You see, the problem is
we can't drive anywhere

18:36.824 --> 18:39.035
because we're stoned.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.328
(whispering):
Right. Maybe we should
call a cab.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.749
Okay. Should I call one

18:44.874 --> 18:47.418
or should I put on
the list to call one?

18:47.543 --> 18:48.669
Why are we whispering?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.337
I'm not sure.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.672
Hey.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.924
Everything okay?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.467
Just making a list.
Oh, yeah!

18:54.592 --> 18:55.676
Fine. Good.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.886
It's good.

18:57.011 --> 18:57.762
(whispers):
Should we tell her?

18:57.887 --> 19:00.681
(whispers):
Yeah, okay.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.434
(louder):
I grabbed a few brownies
from the Post-Prom-A-Looza,

19:03.559 --> 19:05.937
and we suspect that
they contained cannabis.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.396
Now, see,
that you should have whispered.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.773
What?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.775
(whispers):
The nerds had pot brownies.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.234
(snickering)

19:12.359 --> 19:15.237
So, you two are high?

19:15.362 --> 19:17.907
Yes, we are!
We are!

19:18.032 --> 19:19.450
And it, it, it couldn't
be worse timing

19:19.575 --> 19:20.910
because we cannot drive
to find the kids.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.871
Where would you drive exactly?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.539
I have no idea.
(snickers)

19:25.665 --> 19:27.792
Okay.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.543
Everything is gonna be okay.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.711
You have great kids.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.713
I'm sure they're safe.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.007
There's nothing
you can do.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.634
Can we at least
get some snacks?

19:36.759 --> 19:38.719
Yes, I will go to the vending
machine and get you some snacks.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.138
I can't be sure
they're gonna have

19:40.262 --> 19:42.598
barbecued chicken, but maybe
they'll have barbecued chips.

19:42.723 --> 19:46.352
Oh, barbecued peanuts,
pork rinds?

19:48.354 --> 19:49.897
(sighs)

19:50.023 --> 19:51.565
She has a crush on you.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.525
Yeah, right!

19:52.650 --> 19:54.110
(whispering):
I'm serious.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.738
(whispering):
That is the pot talking.
It makes you paranoid, remember?

19:57.864 --> 20:01.784
You see that guy
over there?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.661
15 minutes ago,
I thought he was

20:03.786 --> 20:05.913
the narc that was onto us.

20:06.039 --> 20:09.583
Is he staring at us?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.002
Yes.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.214
(coughing)

20:18.051 --> 20:19.259
Hey, uh, are you okay?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.764
Oh, look...
(giggles)

20:23.890 --> 20:25.265
Annie the rat.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.267
Look, Phoebe...

20:27.393 --> 20:28.895
I'm cool.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.437
(grunts)

20:30.563 --> 20:31.522
Oh, okay.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.732
I'm fine.

20:32.857 --> 20:33.941
I'll just head home.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.651
Phoebe...

20:36.986 --> 20:38.445
how you gonna get home?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.447
I guess I'll walk.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.700
I don't know.

20:42.825 --> 20:46.079
Can you drive me?

20:49.874 --> 20:52.585
Yes, I can drive you.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.794
All right.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.629
Okay, come on.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.840
Wrap around.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.134
Oh!
Let's go. Okay!

21:11.104 --> 21:12.396
Having fun?

21:12.521 --> 21:14.356
Oh, yeah, sure.

21:14.481 --> 21:15.733
Really?

21:15.858 --> 21:16.692
'Cause you look bored.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.903
You caught me.

21:19.028 --> 21:22.489
I'm, um, Naomi's
next-door neighbor.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.784
Zelda.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.326
What's your name?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.370
I'm Liam.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.915
Liam, Liam, Liam...
Why do I know your name?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.541
'Cause I just told it to you.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.920
Oh! I know.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.004
I heard

21:37.130 --> 21:38.631
a crazy story
about you.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.592
Yeah, you're the one
whose mom was a maid, right?

21:41.717 --> 21:43.427
Until she ended up
shagging her boss.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.887
Where did you hear that?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.014
Oh, just a bunch of girls

21:47.140 --> 21:48.307
were gossiping
about you.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.644
Is it true or was
Naomi just exaggerating?

21:51.769 --> 21:53.604
Because she does have
that tendency.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.023
I mean, you know...

21:56.149 --> 21:57.650
she's your girlfriend, right?

21:57.775 --> 22:00.069
No.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.572
Naomi is not my girlfriend.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.621
You know...

22:10.746 --> 22:12.456
I think

22:12.581 --> 22:14.959
that you and I
could find a way

22:15.084 --> 22:16.460
to make this night

22:16.585 --> 22:19.964
a lot more fun.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.758
Oh, yeah?

22:22.883 --> 22:24.468
Yeah.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.230
Adrianna?

22:36.354 --> 22:38.649
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Anthony to Obstetrics.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.400
(groans)

22:40.526 --> 22:42.862
Brenda! Hi.

22:42.987 --> 22:43.779
Hey, sweetie.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.156
You're here.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.907
I thought you were supposed
to be in China.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.117
My show got extended.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.827
I leave for Beijing tomorrow.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.537
But when I heard
that you were here,

22:51.662 --> 22:52.997
I rushed right over
right after curtain.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.166
You're playing Cleopatra?

22:55.291 --> 22:58.127
That's crazy.
I just played Cleopatra.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.920
Well, that doesn't
surprise me.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.922
You and me, we're two of a kind.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.508
I mean,
think about it.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.509
We both love drama.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.136
We both live
pretty dramatic lives.

23:07.261 --> 23:09.138
Yeah, we do.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.639
How's the baby?

23:12.183 --> 23:13.100
Fine.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.061
Healthy, you know.

23:15.186 --> 23:16.854
She's...

23:16.979 --> 23:18.647
(sighs)

23:18.772 --> 23:19.857
she's fine.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.737
Do you want to go for a walk?

23:24.862 --> 23:27.990
Um, I'm not sure
I'm allowed to do that.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.533
Who's gonna stop you?

23:29.658 --> 23:33.746
You are with the Queen of Egypt.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.664
(chuckles)

23:35.789 --> 23:38.209
Okay.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.629
Let's go to
the cafeteria.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.090
Maybe get some Jell-O.

23:44.215 --> 23:47.134
Jell-O?
I love Jell-O.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.844
Me, too.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.055
See?

23:51.180 --> 23:53.057
We are two of a kind.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.684
ADRIANNA:
"Jim Walsh"?

23:55.809 --> 23:57.937
That's not a relative
of yours, is it?

23:59.646 --> 24:02.900
Yeah, that's my father.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.111
He's dying, actually.

24:13.911 --> 24:14.828
Oh, my God.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.164
I'm so sorry.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.253
Oh, you know what
I hope they have?

24:22.378 --> 24:25.756
Jell-O with those
little marshmallows.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.591
Your dad's dying?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.176
Could go any minute.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.636
But shouldn't you be with him?

24:30.761 --> 24:31.929
Ooh!

24:32.054 --> 24:33.597
Too painful.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.015
Of course, it's painful.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.434
I'm just not ready.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.852
But you'll never be ready,
will you? I-I just think

24:38.978 --> 24:40.938
if you don't say good-bye,
you're always gonna regret it.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.774
Have you met my dragon?

24:45.859 --> 24:47.194
Uh...

24:47.320 --> 24:51.031
Handsome, isn't he?

24:51.157 --> 24:53.200
Yes, sure. Brenda...

24:53.326 --> 24:54.118
Shh.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.244
You have to say

24:55.369 --> 24:57.037
good-bye, Brenda.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.790
If you don't,
you're gonna always regret it.

24:59.915 --> 25:00.874
Always!

25:01.000 --> 25:02.918
Good-bye.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.920
I've got to go to China.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.511
Brenda?

25:15.764 --> 25:16.723
Brenda?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.642
Huh?

25:20.811 --> 25:21.895
Huh.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.566
(panting)

25:28.110 --> 25:29.778
(babies crying)

25:43.167 --> 25:45.002
(crying continues)

25:51.008 --> 25:52.176
I want to hold my baby.

26:04.897 --> 26:05.939
Hey...

26:11.195 --> 26:13.989
Hi.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.002
Okay, on three.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.046
One... two...

26:29.171 --> 26:30.256
three!

26:30.381 --> 26:31.340
(all shriek)

26:39.056 --> 26:40.974
(girls squealing)

26:43.143 --> 26:45.979
(all laughing)

27:00.953 --> 27:04.790
So, how long have you had
a thing for my girlfriend?

27:04.915 --> 27:05.916
What?

27:06.041 --> 27:08.210
The way you're looking
at her, man.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.463
Now?

27:10.588 --> 27:11.838
No, I wasn't looking
at Silver.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.882
I was just staring off.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.051
I think, actually,

27:16.176 --> 27:17.677
something got caught
in my contact lens.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.056
The way you were talking
about her before.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.810
Well, come on, man,
I think Silver's great,

27:24.935 --> 27:26.770
you know,

27:26.895 --> 27:28.439
but as a friend.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.065
And as my friend's
girlfriend.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.987
You swear?

27:35.112 --> 27:36.696
Of course.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.410
So why do you have

27:41.535 --> 27:42.660
a picture of her in your pocket?

27:44.121 --> 27:45.164
Well, I...

27:45.289 --> 27:47.040
I got it for you.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.751
(scoffs)

27:49.876 --> 27:51.711
You're lying to me.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.174
Dixon, just let this go.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.343
So you're, you're
just gonna lie to me?

27:57.468 --> 27:58.927
I thought I was your friend.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.137
I am your friend.

28:01.388 --> 28:02.848
And I didn't do anything,

28:02.973 --> 28:04.141
so just back off.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.392
But you wanted to.

28:05.518 --> 28:06.977
You wanted to do something.

28:07.102 --> 28:07.853
Says who?

28:07.978 --> 28:08.854
Just admit it.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.314
Admit what?

28:10.439 --> 28:12.899
Okay, you guys have
to come swimming.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.151
The water's fine.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.862
What's wrong?

28:18.364 --> 28:20.115
Don't lie to me, man.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.867
Drop it, Dixon.

28:21.992 --> 28:22.868
Admit it.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.161
Drop it.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.912
I mean,
you're king jock, right?

28:26.038 --> 28:27.956
So, man up! Admit it!

28:28.081 --> 28:28.915
Fine!

28:31.960 --> 28:33.879
I like you, Silver.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.257
What?

28:47.393 --> 28:48.768
Thank you so much.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.062
I really appreciate it.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.523
You sure it's okay if I go?

28:52.648 --> 28:54.941
Come on. You've been here
all night.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.569
And you have about 200 people

28:56.694 --> 28:58.111
waiting for you
at your house.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.447
Mm, okay. I'll be back here
first thing tomorrow.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.324
And by "first thing,"

29:02.449 --> 29:04.910
I mean mid-afternoon.
Definitely before dinner.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.119
We'll be here.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.538
(both laugh)

29:09.081 --> 29:11.124
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Forest, dial 182, please.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.834
Hey.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.169
Here's the form.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.089
Thanks.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.217
I also want to give this to you.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.887
A cigar?

29:24.012 --> 29:26.014
Yeah, it's what they give
new fathers, right?

29:26.139 --> 29:27.099
So here.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.185
You're a good guy,
Navid.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.020
You've really been there
for Adrianna,

29:32.145 --> 29:33.063
which I respect.

29:34.648 --> 29:36.108
I also respect your left hook.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.984
(chuckles)

29:38.110 --> 29:39.486
Yeah, sorry.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.283
So, uh...

29:44.408 --> 29:46.368
thanks.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.998
Thanks.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.052
Trail mix?

30:04.177 --> 30:05.178
Oh, no, I'm good.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.931
You sure?
It's really good.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.434
I'm sure it is,
but I'm not high.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.477
(chuckles)
Oh, yeah, right.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.103
It's weird.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.273
I forgot how
this makes you feel.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.357
Hungry, paranoid.

30:17.483 --> 30:21.320
You know, earlier,

30:21.445 --> 30:22.488
I actually thought

30:22.613 --> 30:23.863
you had a crush
on my husband.

30:23.989 --> 30:24.323
(chuckles)

30:24.448 --> 30:26.408
What?

30:26.533 --> 30:29.869
Oh, I know, it's insane.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.871
Just, we women,

30:31.997 --> 30:33.457
we get a little jealous,
and, well,

30:33.582 --> 30:34.500
add pot into the mix...
(chuckles)

30:34.625 --> 30:36.042
Debbie, I...

30:36.168 --> 30:37.085
Oh, I know.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.171
It's me. I'm stoned.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.967
That's why I swore off
this stuff in college.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.395
Hey, Savanna,

30:55.521 --> 30:56.563
have you seen Liam?

30:56.689 --> 30:59.232
Oh, my God,
this party is a-ma-zing!

30:59.358 --> 31:00.651
Thank you. Liam?

31:00.776 --> 31:02.152
I think maybe he went upstairs.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.570
Thanks.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.421
You're back.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.552
What have you done?

31:29.346 --> 31:31.598
Who is she?

31:31.724 --> 31:34.976
She's nobody.

31:35.101 --> 31:35.894
And she's gone.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.413
I don't ever
want to see you again.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.629
JEN:
Golly, my sister can be

32:02.755 --> 32:04.798
so high-strung.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.260
And she has such hilariously
bourgeois ideas about fidelity.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.053
Now, where is
my Louboutin?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.054
Ooh.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.097
Here we go.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.265
Your sister?

32:13.390 --> 32:14.558
Are you kidding me?

32:14.683 --> 32:16.142
Naomi is your sister?

32:16.268 --> 32:17.436
Yes.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.271
She was getting a
little full of herself.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.022
She needed to be
knocked down a peg.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.399
Trust me: it's good for her.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.150
You used me.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.151
(chuckles)

32:25.277 --> 32:27.070
It's not like
you didn't have fun, right?

32:27.195 --> 32:30.574
If I were you,
I'd consider myself lucky.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.700
But she is your sister.

32:31.825 --> 32:33.326
I mean,

32:33.452 --> 32:34.411
she's gonna hate you.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.537
Oh, she'll never know it's me.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.414
I mean, you're not
gonna tell her.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.708
Because she'd be devastated.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.334
And you're just not that cruel.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.295
Give me my shirt.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.671
(chuckles)

32:44.797 --> 32:46.172
Aw.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.133
I forgot how cute
teenage boys are

32:48.258 --> 32:50.051
when they're upset.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.394
You are a bitch.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.396
Don't be vulgar.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.397
(chuckles)

33:02.522 --> 33:05.191
And yes, I am.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.985
Only when it's
absolutely necessary.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.498
Annie!

33:21.166 --> 33:22.250
How could you?

33:22.375 --> 33:23.418
What?

33:23.543 --> 33:25.211
You slept with Liam in my bed.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.421
No.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.131
W-What are you talking about?

33:28.256 --> 33:29.466
Don't lie to me.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.426
Naomi, I didn't do anything.

33:31.551 --> 33:34.471
What is this?

33:34.596 --> 33:36.097
It's my wrap.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.182
Which I found

33:37.307 --> 33:38.433
in my room.

33:38.558 --> 33:39.768
How did it get there?

33:39.893 --> 33:41.561
I don't know. I haven't
even been in your room.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.646
Must have been
somebody else.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.063
I was with Phoebe Abrams.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.231
Oh, right!

33:45.357 --> 33:46.441
She hates you!

33:46.566 --> 33:48.151
No. Look, I know
she does.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.529
But she got so drunk
so I had to drive...

33:50.654 --> 33:51.864
NAOMI:
Stop lying to me!
Stop it!

33:51.989 --> 33:54.616
Naomi, I wouldn't do that
to you.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.201
What are you talking about?!
You already have!

33:56.326 --> 33:57.118
What?

33:57.243 --> 33:58.620
Ethan ring a bell?!

33:58.745 --> 34:00.580
And I forgave you

34:00.706 --> 34:02.374
'cause apparently
I was an idiot!

34:02.499 --> 34:03.583
Okay. Naomi,

34:03.709 --> 34:05.460
please stop, okay?
This is crazy.

34:05.585 --> 34:08.045
(laughs)

34:08.170 --> 34:11.382
She acts like she's this
innocent girl from Kansas.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.677
That is not what she is!

34:13.802 --> 34:15.679
Maybe at one time.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.181
Not anymore.
She ratted out the party.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.641
No, I didn't!

34:20.766 --> 34:21.810
No one wants you here.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.228
Why are you still here?

34:23.353 --> 34:26.313
Get out of my house,

34:26.438 --> 34:27.900
Kansas skank!

34:31.277 --> 34:32.487
BOY:
That's for Charlie.

34:32.612 --> 34:36.366
(giggling)
Get out!

34:36.491 --> 34:38.618
Get out!

34:40.370 --> 34:43.790
Screw... screw you, Naomi!

34:46.501 --> 34:48.545
Screw all of you!

34:55.467 --> 34:57.387
(gasping breaths)

34:57.512 --> 34:58.847
(screams)

34:58.972 --> 35:01.099
(gasping breaths)

35:09.816 --> 35:10.692
911 emergency.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.403
Hi, um, I was calling...

35:13.528 --> 35:16.114
I was concerned about some
underage drinking going on

35:16.239 --> 35:21.286
at a party near my house,
174 West Hollybrook.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.663
The house belongs
to Naomi Clark.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.971
(sobs)

35:52.400 --> 35:53.693
Not again.

35:55.445 --> 35:56.738
Where's your dragon?

35:56.863 --> 35:58.239
Honey, did they give you
painkillers?

35:58.364 --> 36:00.993
Wait. Am I awake?

36:01.952 --> 36:03.662
No, I am not awake

36:03.787 --> 36:05.455
because you're in China. Okay.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.665
I got back

36:06.790 --> 36:08.667
a couple hours ago.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.585
(laughs) I'm real.

36:10.710 --> 36:11.711
Sorry.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.506
Uh...

36:14.631 --> 36:15.966
Ade, she is beautiful.

36:16.091 --> 36:20.512
It's hard to believe it was her
all this time... you know?

36:21.638 --> 36:22.848
Inside me.

36:22.973 --> 36:25.350
Pretty amazing.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.726
Yeah, really amazing.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.020
(knocking)

36:28.145 --> 36:31.564
Uh, sorry to interrupt
you guys, but, um,

36:31.690 --> 36:32.482
Greg and Leslie are here.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.275
Already?

36:34.400 --> 36:36.569
Yeah, they're parking
downstairs.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.613
See, this...

36:38.738 --> 36:40.198
this is why
I didn't want to hold her.

36:42.075 --> 36:44.243
(voice breaking):
This is why. This.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.583
Now I have to say good-bye.

36:50.709 --> 36:54.420
How am I gonna say good-bye?
How?!

36:54.546 --> 36:56.756
Hey...

36:56.882 --> 36:58.550
Look, I know
that this is tough,

36:58.675 --> 37:00.927
and this is
your decision.

37:01.053 --> 37:05.098
All I can say is that adoption
is a wonderful gift.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.351
And I'm speaking
from experience.

37:11.021 --> 37:14.524
That's why I was in China.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.651
I adopted a little girl.
(chuckles)

37:16.776 --> 37:18.570
Really?
Yeah.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.572
She's with my mom
and dad right now,

37:20.697 --> 37:22.532
and I cannot wait
for you to meet her.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.660
Trust me,

37:25.785 --> 37:26.995
that couple you chose,

37:27.120 --> 37:30.165
you are making them
so happy.

37:30.289 --> 37:32.751
And they're gonna make her
so happy.

37:36.755 --> 37:42.010
Yeah... I know they are.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.596
(sobs)

37:44.721 --> 37:46.973
You're gonna be really happy,

37:47.099 --> 37:48.474
okay?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.726
Thank you.

37:49.851 --> 37:52.478
You're gonna be happy.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.108
Ethan. Ethan!

37:56.233 --> 37:57.567
Where have you been?!
What's going on?!

37:57.692 --> 37:58.610
What was that?

37:58.735 --> 37:59.986
I never wanted
to say anything.

38:00.112 --> 38:01.905
I don't know
what to do with this, okay?

38:02.030 --> 38:03.698
I mean, you're one
of my best friends,

38:03.823 --> 38:04.783
but that's it, right?

38:04.908 --> 38:06.118
We're just friends.

38:21.591 --> 38:22.842
I don't think
we're just friends.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.971
Ethan... no.

38:26.096 --> 38:28.347
And I don't want
to be just friends.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.601
I don't think
I could take it.

38:33.270 --> 38:36.731
I want to be
something more...

38:36.856 --> 38:39.484
or I don't want
to be anything.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.905
It's up to you, Silver.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.866
Just think about this:

38:46.992 --> 38:49.452
why are you out here
talking with me

38:49.577 --> 38:52.664
instead of inside
talking to your boyfriend?

39:01.798 --> 39:04.342
(sobbing)

39:11.557 --> 39:13.518
It's okay, darling. It's okay.

39:13.643 --> 39:16.562
I'm here
and I'm gonna take

39:16.688 --> 39:19.482
good care of you,
I promise.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.526
I promise.

39:21.651 --> 39:24.904
(sobbing)

39:25.030 --> 39:27.615
(sirens approaching)

39:39.752 --> 39:42.421
You ready?

39:42.547 --> 39:43.381
Yeah, I'm ready.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.058
Hi. Hi. Hi.

39:53.183 --> 39:54.767
(baby fusses)

39:56.728 --> 39:58.479
Hi.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.443
Thank you.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.571
What's her name?

40:06.696 --> 40:08.489
Hey.
Maisie.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.951
That's a really pretty name.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.620
Good-bye, Maisie.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.750
Good-bye.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.177
(voice breaking):
I did the right thing, right?

40:29.302 --> 40:32.305
You did a really
good thing.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.184
Oh!

40:50.656 --> 40:54.160
Hey, Naomi, it's Liam.

40:54.286 --> 40:57.080
Look, I know I messed up.

40:57.205 --> 41:00.125
I need to talk to you.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.209
Get out of bed! Get dressed!

41:01.334 --> 41:02.501
What the hell?!

41:02.627 --> 41:03.586
You're coming with us
to Stembrook.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.880
It's a wilderness
therapy program.

41:06.005 --> 41:06.798
Now get dressed!

41:06.923 --> 41:08.716
Mom!

41:08.841 --> 41:10.718
You can't make me do this!
Yes, we can.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.263
Your stepfather's fed up!
All this skipping school,

41:13.388 --> 41:15.974
stolen credit cards--
it's over.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.568
(loud thud)

41:37.036 --> 41:39.747
(tires squeal)
