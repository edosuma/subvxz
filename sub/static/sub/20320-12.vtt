WEBVTT

00:04.677 --> 00:06.678
Could you read that again,
please, one more time?

00:06.746 --> 00:09.147
- Really put some oomph into it.
- This is the last time.

00:09.214 --> 00:11.650
All right,
make sure you enunciate.

00:11.717 --> 00:15.820
- All right. "Mr. Osman Bey--"
- Go on.

00:16.013 --> 00:18.114
"On behalf of the Emergency
Medical Services

00:18.182 --> 00:20.416
"Certification Board,
it's our privilege to inform you

00:20.484 --> 00:23.786
"that you have completed
the 24-week training program

00:23.854 --> 00:26.789
and now are certified for the
position of station supervisor."

00:26.857 --> 00:29.959
- Mm!
- "We wish you--" Ah, come on.

00:30.026 --> 00:32.061
That is music to my ears.
And could you pass me

00:32.128 --> 00:34.964
- one more slice of pizza, please, my good buddy?
- Oh, why, yes.

00:35.031 --> 00:37.098
It is my, my pleasure,
Mr. Supervisor.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.600
Ooh, I like that.

00:38.668 --> 00:40.702
"Mr. Supervisor."
I should change my name.

00:40.770 --> 00:43.538
"Oh, lovely weather
we're having, Mr. Supervisor."

00:43.606 --> 00:45.540
And then I would
walk in the door.

00:45.608 --> 00:47.642
There would be trumpets--
the whole thing.

00:47.710 --> 00:50.612
You know what? I gotta-- I'm gonna
be very honest with you here, man.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.415
What I love about this letter
and this certificate--

00:54.483 --> 00:57.451
I almost don't recognize you
because you've just become

00:57.519 --> 01:00.454
- so humble.
- OK, can you just let me have

01:00.522 --> 01:04.391
a little moment with this, OK, before the
illusion of power is shattered? I mean,

01:04.459 --> 01:06.427
sure, it's a beautifully printed
piece of paper

01:06.495 --> 01:09.262
in a very expensive frame,
but that's it.

01:09.329 --> 01:12.365
It just says I can do the job;
it doesn't say I have the job.

01:12.433 --> 01:16.269
Why didn't you say that
before? Like, I got all this

01:16.336 --> 01:19.171
- 'cause I thought this was a bit of a celebration here.
- What do you want me to do?

01:19.239 --> 01:21.173
Ryder's not gonna leave the job
any time soon.

01:21.241 --> 01:23.175
He'll be doing that job
when he's dead.

01:23.243 --> 01:27.345
I don't know. He's got grey hair.
He's a stress ball.

03:00.734 --> 03:01.842
Jeez.

03:01.962 --> 03:04.736
Mr. Bey. I understand
congratulations are in order.

03:04.803 --> 03:08.072
- Thank you, sir.
- I guess I'd better be

03:08.139 --> 03:10.475
watching my back, huh? Got some
new blood waiting in the wings.

03:10.542 --> 03:13.010
Oh, don't worry, sir. Your old
blood is perfectly safe.

03:13.078 --> 03:15.012
- What was that?
- Not OLD blood;

03:15.080 --> 03:17.715
just, mine is newer. That's
all I'm saying. It's like wine.

03:17.783 --> 03:19.850
Ah. OK, listen. Don't worry
about it. Listen, uh,

03:19.917 --> 03:22.552
there's someone here to see you.
Says he's an old friend.

03:22.620 --> 03:25.188
- OK. Thank you.
- Old blood...

03:35.465 --> 03:36.965
Ozzy!

03:37.033 --> 03:39.735
Look at this! Look at you, man!
It's good to you see ya.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.670
Tommy, what the hell are
you doing here?

03:41.738 --> 03:43.406
What, I can't drop in
on an old friend?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.274
How did you even find me?
I haven't seen you in,

03:45.341 --> 03:46.942
what, like three years?

03:47.010 --> 03:49.344
- What, do you need money again?
- What? No. Come on, man.

03:49.413 --> 03:51.246
Look, I know I've hit you up
in the past, OK,

03:51.314 --> 03:53.282
but this is different.
I'm clean now.

03:53.349 --> 03:56.151
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm six months clean!

03:56.219 --> 03:58.486
- Wow! I don't believe you.
- It's true! I swear.

03:58.554 --> 04:00.188
Look, Oz...

04:00.256 --> 04:03.391
You're my oldest friend, and...

04:03.458 --> 04:05.293
I don't have anywhere else
I can go right now.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.261
Yeah, you don't get to play
that card anymore. Really good

04:07.329 --> 04:09.163
to see you, though. Love the
chain. Really working for you.

04:09.231 --> 04:11.098
I saw a guy get shot
last night.

04:11.166 --> 04:13.134
What?

04:13.201 --> 04:15.536
It happened right in front of
me. Corner of Pearl and Duncan.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.503
You were involved
in a shooting?

04:17.571 --> 04:20.040
No, I was on my way home.
I was minding my own business.

04:20.107 --> 04:22.675
- So you didn't know the victim?
- No. I don't think so.

04:22.743 --> 04:24.677
I didn't get
a good look at him, but...

04:24.745 --> 04:26.913
the shooter is
a different story.

04:26.981 --> 04:28.581
I'm sorry,
you knew the shooter?

04:28.649 --> 04:30.616
Yeah, well, not by name,
but I've seen him around the bar

04:30.684 --> 04:33.018
a few times.
The thing is, Oz, he saw me.

04:33.086 --> 04:34.519
He even took a few shots at me.

04:34.587 --> 04:37.189
- I got shot at last night!
- OK, calm down, all right?

04:37.257 --> 04:39.191
That doesn't mean
he recognized you.

04:39.259 --> 04:41.793
That's what I was thinking.
Except for I go out for a coffee

04:41.861 --> 04:43.795
this morning. When I get back,
my apartment had been

04:43.863 --> 04:46.098
broken into. Now,
that's gotta be him, right?

04:46.166 --> 04:48.767
I mean, what if--what if I was
home? What if I'd been there?

04:48.835 --> 04:51.470
OK, just-- Wait a sec,
how did he find you so fast?

04:51.537 --> 04:54.372
I don't know. Everybody at the bar knows me.
He could have asked around.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.976
Right. What did the cops say when
you reported this?

04:58.043 --> 05:01.012
You didn't report it to the cops.
Why am I not surprised?

05:01.080 --> 05:03.181
I know how they're gonna treat
a guy with a track record, OK?

05:03.248 --> 05:07.518
Look, I just... I just need a place to
crash for a couple of days, all right?

05:07.586 --> 05:10.721
When this thing cools down, I'll
be out of your hair, I promise.

05:10.789 --> 05:14.291
You know what? We're going to
meet my friend Toby first. Yeah.

05:14.359 --> 05:17.795
- He is a lot more adept at handling this type of situation.
- Ozzy, come on, man--

05:17.863 --> 05:19.830
First of all,
don't call me that.

05:19.898 --> 05:22.365
If you want my help,
we go do this thing first.

05:44.654 --> 05:46.622
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:46.689 --> 05:49.558
What's going on, man?
How are ya?

05:49.626 --> 05:52.494
- Hey.
- Come on in. Who's this?

05:52.562 --> 05:55.162
- Toby, this is Tommy.
Hey. - Tommy.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.231
Can I talk to yo
in the kitchen for a sec?

05:57.298 --> 06:00.267
- Yeah, yeah.
- Stay here.

06:04.039 --> 06:08.876
OK, so this is Tommy. Comes around
whenever he needs your help,

06:08.944 --> 06:11.310
splits, and you're left
cleaning up the mess Tommy.

06:11.378 --> 06:14.681
That's... actually a very
accurate description, yeah.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.684
- All right, so you're getting involved again.
- It's a pain in the ass, OK?

06:17.752 --> 06:21.287
- But he says he's clean.
- And you believe him? - I don't know.

06:21.355 --> 06:23.489
- That's why I'm here.
- You need me to read him.

06:23.558 --> 06:26.391
If he's telling the truth, he's in more
trouble than he's ever been in his life.

06:26.459 --> 06:29.028
All right, what happened?

06:35.234 --> 06:37.102
Hey, what's Tommy doing?

06:37.170 --> 06:40.739
Hey, Tommy! What's the deal,
where are you going, man?

06:40.807 --> 06:43.007
You failed to mention
that your buddy here is a cop.

06:43.075 --> 06:45.009
I'm not a cop,
I'm just a consultant.

06:45.077 --> 06:47.045
- Yeah, for the cops.
- Tommy,

06:47.112 --> 06:49.413
you came to me asking for help.
If I say Toby's OK,

06:49.481 --> 06:51.515
he's OK.

06:54.853 --> 06:56.988
All right.
I'm sorry, buddy. I, uh...

06:57.056 --> 07:00.057
I'm a bit twisted up here.
I haven't slept, you know?

07:00.124 --> 07:02.525
No, it's all right, man. I get
it. If I'm gonna help you out,

07:02.594 --> 07:04.527
I just want to know
if you're using or not.

07:04.596 --> 07:06.797
No.

07:06.864 --> 07:09.265
No, I've been clean
for six months.

07:09.333 --> 07:13.570
<i>Getting off the needle is</i>
<i>the smartest thing I ever did.</i>

07:13.637 --> 07:15.805
OK.

07:15.872 --> 07:18.674
All right, look, uh,
Oz gave me the rundown.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.176
He said you saw
a guy get killed last night?

07:21.244 --> 07:24.580
Yeah, I was
in spitting distance.

07:27.884 --> 07:30.218
All right, we'll bring you in,
you can give a statement.

07:30.285 --> 07:33.554
No. Last time I dealt
with cops, I cooperated myself

07:33.623 --> 07:35.590
into three broken ribs
and some jail time,

07:35.658 --> 07:38.192
- OK? I'm not dealing with cops.
- All right, look, Oz,

07:38.260 --> 07:40.194
if he's not going to cooperate,
the only thing I can do is

07:40.262 --> 07:42.296
go to Metro and see
if they've got any leads.

07:42.364 --> 07:45.100
Well, he's not safe in his house.
It got broken into this morning.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.400
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.104
All right, well, if they're going after him,
they're going to start with his friends.

07:50.171 --> 07:51.772
You get that?

07:51.840 --> 07:54.574
- I never thought of that.
- All right, I'll go see

07:54.643 --> 07:57.678
if I can find out anything
about the shooting.

07:57.746 --> 07:59.713
In the meantime,

07:59.814 --> 08:03.249
you guys stay here, all right?
You need to lay low.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.253
- I can't ask you to do that.
- Look, you're not asking, OK? I'm insisting.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.456
I'm going to go check out where he saw the
shooting, see if I can find any evidence.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.591
I'm going with you.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.460
I'm getting you involved
in this, I gotta go too.

08:14.561 --> 08:18.263
All right.
Look, make yourself at home.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.831
All right,

08:19.866 --> 08:22.400
- don't touch anything.
- Yeah.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.409
So, what is it
with you and Tommy, anyway?

08:32.477 --> 08:35.279
I don't know, man.
We used to be inseparable,

08:35.346 --> 08:37.381
from two to, like, 12.

08:37.448 --> 08:40.650
Just a couple of snot-nosed kids getting
in every kind of trouble you can think of.

08:40.719 --> 08:43.620
Then my parents lowered
the boom. The way they saw it,

08:43.688 --> 08:47.692
they didn't immigrate from Turkey for me
to waste my days as a shiftless layabout.

08:47.759 --> 08:50.626
- Layabout.
- Yeah, that's my mother's second-favourite word.

08:50.695 --> 08:54.430
After "cataclysm", which she threatened to
unleash upon me if I didn't do what she said.

08:54.498 --> 08:56.900
So I had to stop hanging out
with Tommy.

08:56.967 --> 09:01.171
He kept getting into trouble-- dropped out
of high school, drugs, the whole thing.

09:01.238 --> 09:03.272
So why does Tommy keep coming
back to you?

09:03.340 --> 09:06.742
I don't know. I guess
I got a soft spot for the kid.

09:06.810 --> 09:09.344
I figure under that mountain
of bad behaviour

09:09.412 --> 09:11.646
and terrible decisions
he's got a good heart.

09:11.715 --> 09:14.482
You know, you don't have
to be involved in this; I do.

09:14.550 --> 09:17.319
So I really appreciate you,
uh... helping me out.

09:17.386 --> 09:21.423
Don't thank me yet.
I can't guarantee any results.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.894
You do understand the concept
of a day off, right? It means

09:26.962 --> 09:28.963
you don't actually have
to come in to work.

09:29.031 --> 09:31.298
Yeah, I do. Uh, but I've got
a big favour to ask you guys.

09:31.366 --> 09:34.035
What, and take us away from
hours of super-fun paperwork?

09:34.103 --> 09:36.403
- What's going on?
- Oz's friend, Tommy,

09:36.471 --> 09:38.671
he saw, uh,
a murder last night.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.174
Recognized the shooter
from a bar.

09:41.242 --> 09:43.376
- And this Tommy is reliable?
- Not really.

09:43.444 --> 09:45.378
OK, well,
has Metro been informed?

09:45.446 --> 09:48.048
No. I don't think so.
Oz and I, we went by the scene--

09:48.116 --> 09:51.218
no body, victim's car was gone.
See, here's the thing:

09:51.285 --> 09:55.755
I got a read of Tommy, and I saw the shooter.
He took a few shots at him.

09:55.822 --> 09:58.690
OK, so have Tommy come down
and file a report.

09:58.759 --> 10:00.525
That's the other thing:
he doesn't really want to talk

10:00.593 --> 10:02.427
- to the cops.
- Right, so we have

10:02.495 --> 10:04.730
no body, no evidence,
and an unreliable witness

10:04.798 --> 10:06.732
who doesn't really want
to talk to the cops.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.868
- Big favour.
- Yeah.

10:08.935 --> 10:12.070
Well, Klein's out of the office. I mean, I
guess we could work on this for a few hours,

10:12.138 --> 10:14.072
but we can't file
an official report.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.174
All right, let's hear
what Metro's got.

10:16.242 --> 10:19.077
- Uh, where did it go down?
- Pearl and Duncan, around 1am.

10:19.145 --> 10:21.612
Pearl and Duncan.

10:24.150 --> 10:27.251
No. No gunshot victims admitted
to any hospitals.

10:27.318 --> 10:29.253
It must not have been reported.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.688
Well, look, I got a good look
at the shooter in my read.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.024
Maybe we can do a composition?

10:34.092 --> 10:36.827
OK, you boys knock
yourselves out. I got paperwork.

10:36.895 --> 10:39.062
- We will.
- I'm gonna take my jacket off.

10:39.130 --> 10:43.199
- Hey, Oz, you want a sandwich?
- You sure made yourself at home fast.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.835
What can I say?
Fear makes me hungry.

10:45.903 --> 10:48.938
Well, Toby and I went down to the crime scene.
We didn't find anything.

10:49.006 --> 10:51.073
All I can tell you is
they were there last night.

10:51.141 --> 10:54.143
- Fridge.
- Oh, sorry, Mom.

10:54.211 --> 10:55.644
What is this?

10:55.712 --> 10:59.114
I like my cheese slices
orange and individually wrapped.

10:59.182 --> 11:01.850
What am I, Rachael Ray? This isn't
even my house, for crying out loud.

11:01.918 --> 11:05.453
You know, Oz, this is gonna be fine. I've
been in tougher situations than this.

11:05.521 --> 11:08.223
Yeah, well, that's your world,
not mine. I prefer to patch up

11:08.291 --> 11:10.391
people who get shot
than to get shot.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.527
Did you ever think
we'd end up so different?

11:12.594 --> 11:15.296
It's all choices, Tommy.
You had the same breaks I did.

11:15.363 --> 11:17.497
I don't know.
I never had your folks.

11:17.565 --> 11:20.868
Your folks cared for you, man.
They cared for you so much,

11:20.936 --> 11:22.970
you weren't allowed
to hang out with me.

11:23.038 --> 11:24.972
I never felt
like anybody cared.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.875
Doesn't mean you had
to throw it all away. I mean,

11:27.943 --> 11:30.810
- don't you get tired of calling me, asking for help?
- Yeah, I'm not proud of it, but

11:30.878 --> 11:33.246
I'm telling you,
that's behind me now, bro.

11:33.314 --> 11:36.649
Yeah well, I'd love
to be able to believe you.

11:36.717 --> 11:38.651
And I don't blame you
if you don't.

11:38.719 --> 11:40.720
I know I've screwed you over...
so many times.

11:40.787 --> 11:44.523
I know I can't ever make that right, but
it doesn't mean I'm not going to try.

11:44.591 --> 11:47.625
Hang on.

11:47.693 --> 11:49.194
Hey, buddy. Any luck?

11:49.262 --> 11:51.763
What's the name of the bar
that Tommy saw the shooter in?

11:51.831 --> 11:55.167
Hey, what's the name of the place
where you saw the guy with the thing?

11:55.235 --> 11:57.269
- The Horseshoe. Queen West.
- Did you get that?

11:57.337 --> 11:59.338
Yeah, I got it.
Hang tight, man.

11:59.405 --> 12:01.306
- OK.
- What's his internet password?

12:01.374 --> 12:03.707
Yeah, we are. Bye.

12:03.775 --> 12:06.744
You going to cut me
half of that, or what?

12:06.811 --> 12:10.481
Hey, uh, we got a composite
of the shooter from my read.

12:10.548 --> 12:13.450
Tommy saw the guy at the Horseshoe. I'm gonna
go by and check it out. Want to join me?

12:13.518 --> 12:16.587
Yeah. You put word out on the
car Toby saw in his read?

12:16.654 --> 12:20.223
Yeah, but without even a partial plate,
it's not really going to help us.

12:20.291 --> 12:23.593
I mean, there's hundreds of vehicles that
match that description in the GTA alone.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.129
OK, well, if there's
any missing persons reported,

12:26.197 --> 12:28.298
match the names
against the vehicle types.

12:28.366 --> 12:31.268
- Yeah. You got it.
- Thank you.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.370
♪ Keepin' the beat
if you lose your bet ♪

12:33.437 --> 12:35.404
♪ Fryin' bacon in my-- ♪

12:35.471 --> 12:37.873
- No. I don't know.
- OK. Thank you.

12:37.941 --> 12:40.309
So, how's it going?
You get anything?

12:40.377 --> 12:42.477
- No, nothing.
- Let's try this guy over here.

12:42.545 --> 12:45.147
How you doing?
You recognize this guy?

12:45.215 --> 12:49.318
- We think he might be a regular.
<i>- What do they want with Dom? Guy's a psycho.</i>

12:49.386 --> 12:51.485
Sorry. Don't know him.

12:53.522 --> 12:57.325
OK, well, if you lied to us, we could
make your life very difficult.

12:57.393 --> 13:00.594
<i>Ratting out Barkin's crew is</i>
<i>a good way to get dead.</i>

13:00.662 --> 13:03.531
Like I said, never seen him.

13:08.136 --> 13:10.203
- Huh?
- Guy's name is Dom.

13:10.271 --> 13:12.239
Think he works
for a guy named Barkin.

13:12.307 --> 13:14.207
Could be Xander Barkin.
He runs the largest bookie

13:14.275 --> 13:16.209
operation in the city. We've
been after him for a while now.

13:16.277 --> 13:18.278
- Really?
- Yeah?

13:18.346 --> 13:21.148
Hey. We got a hit on the car.
The same make, model, and colour

13:21.215 --> 13:23.449
was found dumped out on the spit
at the waterfront.

13:23.516 --> 13:25.918
- Who's it registered to?
<i>- Jake Salisbury.</i>

13:25.986 --> 13:28.854
I'm trying to get a hold of him, but there's
no answer on any of his contact numbers.

13:28.922 --> 13:32.124
<i>- OK, where is it now?
- It's at impound. Metro already knows you're coming.</i>

13:47.149 --> 13:48.923
We have a guy
who witnessed a murder,

13:49.050 --> 13:50.818
and rather than
report it to Metro

13:50.886 --> 13:53.887
you hijack this team, you did
some digging around on your own.

13:53.955 --> 13:55.789
Am I understanding this
correctly?

13:55.857 --> 13:58.224
He's a childhood friend
of my good buddy, Oz.

13:58.292 --> 14:00.727
He's had some trouble
with drugs in the past.

14:00.795 --> 14:02.629
He's a little paranoid
about the cops.

14:02.697 --> 14:05.599
So now we're going on the word of a junkie.
This just keeps getting better.

14:05.666 --> 14:08.434
- Well, he's clean now.
- OK, you said you have the shooter's name?

14:08.502 --> 14:11.336
- Yeah, his first name is Dom.
- That's not a lot to go on,

14:11.404 --> 14:14.406
but I can check for a connection
between that name and the victim.

14:14.474 --> 14:18.110
No. We hand the case over to Metro.
They can handle it from here.

14:18.177 --> 14:20.813
- OK, what are we going to do?
- We have more pressing cases.

14:20.881 --> 14:23.883
A guy is murdered, the killer's on the loose.
Is that not pressing enough?

14:23.950 --> 14:26.784
This isn't about a case for you;
this is about a friend of yours.

14:26.852 --> 14:28.786
Well, that doesn't make it
any less urgent.

14:31.223 --> 14:33.457
What do we know
about the dead guy?

14:33.526 --> 14:36.561
His name was Jake Salisbury.
He was 28.

14:36.629 --> 14:38.696
The coroner just confirmed
the cause of death was

14:38.764 --> 14:42.098
- two 9-mil slugs to the chest.
- Which matches what our witness saw.

14:42.166 --> 14:45.002
He kept out of trouble for the most part.
He was single, no kids. And up until

14:45.069 --> 14:47.971
- six months ago, he worked construction full time.
- He was let go?

14:48.039 --> 14:50.140
Well, according to his crew
foreman, he just came in one day

14:50.207 --> 14:52.242
and gave notice,
never gave a reason why.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.846
- We don't know where he went?
- I looked into his bank accounts, and it seems

14:55.914 --> 14:58.047
that unemployment pays
better than a day job.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.115
So he's working
under the table.

15:00.183 --> 15:03.052
All of his recent deposits were cash,
so I looked at his phone records,

15:03.119 --> 15:05.721
and he has ties to--get this--
the Black Bull Pub.

15:05.789 --> 15:08.991
Which is a front for Xander Barkin's
illegal sports betting operation.

15:09.059 --> 15:12.227
Well, why didn't you open with this
piece of information to begin with?

15:12.295 --> 15:16.297
Now we have ourselves a case.

15:24.874 --> 15:27.609
- Hey.
- Thanks.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.209
There you go.

15:33.281 --> 15:35.649
Is that like Turkish coffee
or something?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.851
Well, it's coffee,
and I am Turkish.

15:40.789 --> 15:44.424
What? - I'm just thinking
about that guy that got popped

15:44.492 --> 15:46.926
last night, man. That so easily
could have been me.

15:46.994 --> 15:49.228
I mean, that's where
my whole life has been headed.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.430
Yeah, I know,
you kind of had it rough.

15:51.498 --> 15:53.432
I shouldn't have been
so hard on you earlier.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.468
Well, I bring it on myself.

15:55.535 --> 15:57.536
But I'm telling you,
seeing that last night,

15:57.605 --> 15:59.538
that's a wakeup call.
That's not going to be me.

15:59.607 --> 16:03.174
- Well, that's up to you.
- But I'm telling you...

16:03.242 --> 16:05.543
this coffee is crap.

16:05.612 --> 16:08.580
- Yeah, it's really bad. I mean, I'm drinking it, but it's awful.
- Did you use coffee and water?

16:08.648 --> 16:12.183
Hey, what's up?

16:12.251 --> 16:15.353
Hey, Oz. Can you ask Tommy if he
knows a guy named Jake Salisbury?

16:15.421 --> 16:18.789
The name Jake Salisbury mean
anything to you?

16:18.857 --> 16:20.858
No. Why, should it?
What's going on?

16:20.926 --> 16:24.962
Don't worry about it, man. Hang in there.
He doesn't know the guy.

16:41.411 --> 16:44.114
<i>...all he wants</i>
<i>is a big right to the jab.</i>

16:44.181 --> 16:46.716
Once he comes in--look at that.
Great movement, but he's got...

16:46.784 --> 16:48.551
Xander Barkin.

16:48.619 --> 16:51.286
- Long time, no see.
- It's OK, Grant.

16:51.354 --> 16:53.455
She's an old friend.

16:53.523 --> 16:56.424
- Isn't that right, Sergeant McCluskey?
- I see you've been upgrading.

16:56.492 --> 16:59.294
It's been a good couple years.

16:59.362 --> 17:02.597
How's Mr. Klein? Please tell me
he's making another run at me,

17:02.666 --> 17:05.165
'cause my lawyers haven't had
anybody to chew up for a while.

17:05.233 --> 17:09.170
- Look, we've got a few questions to ask you.
- Look, it talks!

17:09.237 --> 17:13.007
- Heh-heh.
- Do you have a bookie on your crew named Jake Salisbury?

17:13.075 --> 17:15.643
I may have an employee
by that name.

17:15.711 --> 17:17.779
I don't know. I'd have to check.
Why? What's he done?

17:17.846 --> 17:21.214
He was killed last night.
You know anything about that?

17:21.282 --> 17:23.817
It's got nothing to do with me.

17:23.885 --> 17:26.118
<i>What the hell is this?</i>
<i>Some kind of setup?</i>

17:26.188 --> 17:29.423
Do you have a guy named Dom
on your payroll?

17:29.491 --> 17:32.560
If you mean Dom Westing, your information
is a couple years old. I haven't seen him

17:32.627 --> 17:35.095
in ages.
<i>Not since I paid him</i>

17:35.163 --> 17:38.464
<i>to get the hell out of town.</i>
<i>Testimony would have sunk me.</i>

17:38.532 --> 17:40.866
Thank you for your time.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.635
Wait, that's it?

17:42.703 --> 17:44.870
Always a pleasure, Sergeant.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.872
He was surprised
about Jake's murder.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.209
He paid Westing
to get out of town

17:49.276 --> 17:51.311
to keep him off the stand.

17:53.613 --> 17:56.515
- Hey. How'd it go with Barkin?
<i>- I need you to find me</i>

17:56.583 --> 17:59.050
a current address for
Dom Westing. He may recently be

17:59.118 --> 18:01.453
back in town, so check hotels
or rooms by the month.

18:01.521 --> 18:04.089
Will do. In the meantime,
I tracked down someone

18:04.156 --> 18:06.658
you'll want to talk to.
A rounder who knows Jake.

18:06.726 --> 18:09.393
- One of Barkin's guys?
<i>- No, a rival under-bookie.</i>

18:09.461 --> 18:12.663
He probably just smells the opportunity
to take down the head of the competition.

18:12.731 --> 18:15.600
- Is he in interrogation?
<i>- No.</i> He'll only talk to you on his turf.

18:25.409 --> 18:29.246
- Reggie Danks?
- Damn. You're a cop?

18:29.313 --> 18:33.450
Sergeant McCluskey.
I appreciate your cooperation.

18:33.517 --> 18:35.818
Yeah. Well,
I was promised immunity.

18:35.886 --> 18:38.988
- We'll honour those terms.
- All right. I'm thinking I can

18:39.056 --> 18:42.258
get some previous charges dropped too.
You know, as a show of good faith?

18:42.325 --> 18:45.294
Aha! Look, don't push
your luck here.

18:45.362 --> 18:47.730
What can you tell me
about Jake Salisbury?

18:47.797 --> 18:50.065
I know he was a young
up-and-comer.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.401
A real Turk.
Guy came out of nowhere.

18:52.469 --> 18:55.738
I made a play for him, but
Barkin has the deeper pockets.

18:55.805 --> 18:57.905
- He's that good?
- For a time.

18:57.973 --> 19:00.074
What happened?

19:00.142 --> 19:04.178
Way I hear it, Boy Wonder started
having a string of bad nights recently.

19:04.246 --> 19:07.815
- How bad?
- Well, three or four big payouts over the course

19:07.883 --> 19:09.917
of a few weeks.
You hear the numbers involved,

19:09.985 --> 19:12.453
and suddenly it's not surprising
he turns up dead.

19:12.521 --> 19:15.455
- So maybe his luck ran out.
- Ah, that's one possibility.

19:15.523 --> 19:17.591
You have another?

19:17.659 --> 19:21.428
My theory,
he was running a grift--

19:21.496 --> 19:24.264
he had a partner on the outside
who would place bets with him,

19:24.332 --> 19:26.833
then Jake would fix the book
once the scores came in,

19:26.901 --> 19:29.635
make sure his boy won.
Then they'd split the profits.

19:29.703 --> 19:32.538
Is this a common practice
among bookies?

19:32.606 --> 19:35.841
Not the ones who want to live
long, healthy lives.

19:42.516 --> 19:46.017
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

19:46.084 --> 19:49.587
So, he's telling the truth.
That means Jake has a partner.

19:49.655 --> 19:54.793
- Anything else?
- Well, yeah. He thinks you're really, very, super-smoking hot

19:54.860 --> 19:57.696
for a cop, and he would love
to take you for a ride. - OK, no, no, no.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.664
You don't want
to hear the rest of this?

19:59.732 --> 20:02.933
- No, thank you. Really.
- I saw it. It was quite vivid, actually.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.168
<i>Dev, did you find</i>
<i>an address for Westing?</i>

20:05.236 --> 20:08.439
I did. It's a short-term
apartment rental on Adelaide.

20:08.506 --> 20:11.475
The owner said he paid up for a month,
<i>but it's up at the end of the week.</i>

20:11.543 --> 20:14.511
- Well, he's planning on leaving town again.
- Why would he come back at all?

20:14.579 --> 20:17.314
Well, Reggie said Jake had
a silent partner.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.683
Maybe Dom Westing came into town long
enough to run a grift with Jake,

20:20.751 --> 20:23.887
- then he splits with the profits.
- Yeah, the timeline matches.

20:23.955 --> 20:25.989
- Yeah.
<i>- So, the murder wasn't a hit</i>

20:26.057 --> 20:29.592
put out by Barkin, but instead, what,
a disagreement between partners?

20:29.660 --> 20:32.028
Or it could have been
a premeditated double-cross.

20:32.096 --> 20:35.464
- That's a credible theory.
<i>- Agreed.</i> Let me see if there's a connection

20:35.531 --> 20:39.401
- between Jake and Dom.
- Well, in the meantime, let's bring him in for questioning.

20:41.937 --> 20:44.973
Can't hide from me,
you little prick.

20:58.987 --> 21:00.521
Hey.

21:00.589 --> 21:02.456
I thought we weren't meeting
till later.

21:02.524 --> 21:04.792
Got tired
of sitting around waiting.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.728
Oh, come on, Rand. What is this?
I told you I'd take care of it.

21:07.796 --> 21:09.997
Heh! Heh! Heh! You've really
done a bang-up job so far.

21:10.064 --> 21:13.066
You got the cash,
or did you screw that up too?

21:15.035 --> 21:16.703
I got what he had.

21:16.771 --> 21:18.838
- What does that mean?
- He tried to undercut us.

21:18.906 --> 21:22.275
Only came up with half the cash.
Deserved what he got.

21:22.342 --> 21:24.844
Letting that kid
get away was sloppy.

21:24.912 --> 21:28.014
I'll take care of him!
I got an idea who he's with.

21:28.081 --> 21:30.115
Some paramedic.

21:32.852 --> 21:36.254
You made a mess here, Dom.
Now I gotta clean it up.

21:36.322 --> 21:38.757
Why don't the bad guys
ever live on the ground floor?

21:47.466 --> 21:49.834
Call it in.

21:49.902 --> 21:52.470
Stop! Police!

22:27.266 --> 22:30.401
So, the shooter man gets shot.

22:30.469 --> 22:33.438
Some kind of vicious
criminal cycle.

22:33.505 --> 22:37.241
The killer left cash and ID,

22:37.308 --> 22:39.610
but nothing else
to tell us what he was into.

22:39.677 --> 22:41.287
Well, maybe we'll get
something with fingerprints.

22:41.390 --> 22:43.591
I doubt it. Looks like
the killer was a pro.

22:43.659 --> 22:45.726
Yeah, I don't think
it was Barkin.

22:45.794 --> 22:49.064
- As far as he's concerned, Westing is out of town.
- So maybe we tipped him off.

22:49.131 --> 22:52.033
Now we just need to prove how
Jake and Westing were connected.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.234
And then we need to figure out
why they both had to die.

22:54.302 --> 22:57.137
You think whoever shot Westing
knows about Tommy?

22:57.205 --> 23:00.074
We should call Oz.

23:00.141 --> 23:02.476
Yeah.

23:07.147 --> 23:09.916
Here we go.
Some real coffee.

23:09.984 --> 23:12.619
Should be infinitely
more potable for you, sir.

23:12.687 --> 23:15.789
- Oh, why, thank you, James.
- James? What is that from?

23:15.856 --> 23:18.058
Yeah, remember you used
to double me on that old BMX?

23:18.125 --> 23:20.526
I used to say, "Oh,
to the bus station, James".

23:20.595 --> 23:24.162
- Yeah, how could I forget?
- We used to spend days down at that place, man,

23:24.230 --> 23:26.665
playing the videogames,
stealing wine gums.

23:26.733 --> 23:28.667
Do you remember,
we used to look up,

23:28.735 --> 23:30.669
we used to look up
at the destination board

23:30.737 --> 23:33.405
and just dream that if we could
only get on one of these buses

23:33.473 --> 23:35.407
we'd find some
amazing adventure.

23:35.475 --> 23:37.742
I don't think I want the kind
of adventure you find on a bus.

23:37.810 --> 23:41.212
Sometimes I think I should
have got on one of those buses.

23:41.279 --> 23:45.216
All I ever found was grief for everybody
around me-- for my family, for you.

23:45.283 --> 23:49.087
You know, I always appreciated that even
after we weren't allowed to hang out,

23:49.154 --> 23:52.156
- you still kept in touch.
- Yeah, well, poor judgement was

23:52.224 --> 23:54.992
- always one of my strong suits.
- No, that was decent of you.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.527
You're a decent guy.
I'm glad that you--you know,

23:57.595 --> 24:00.396
you finished school,
you got a good job,

24:00.464 --> 24:03.500
a girlfriend, some money,
you're out there saving lives.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.669
You did good, man.
I'm proud of you.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.672
Hey, you think they still got
that <i>Alien Nightmare</i> game down there?

24:08.740 --> 24:10.740
Man, the quarters we wasted

24:10.807 --> 24:12.708
on that thing, we could have
all gone to dental school.

24:12.776 --> 24:14.810
No, I was down there
a couple of days ago.

24:14.878 --> 24:18.313
All the games are cleared out. It's all fixed up.
There's a little café in there now.

24:18.381 --> 24:22.985
- Ehh.
- Still the buses, though.

24:23.053 --> 24:26.254
- Hey, Toby. Talk to me.
- Hey, Oz. We found the shooter.

24:26.321 --> 24:28.389
You found him?
So it's over?

24:28.457 --> 24:30.625
Maybe not.
Uh, he was dead.

24:30.693 --> 24:35.664
But that's... enough to get
Tommy off the hook, isn't it?

24:35.731 --> 24:38.199
The shooter was the only one
that Tommy saw.

24:38.267 --> 24:40.334
All right, look, we don't know
who else he told about Tommy.

24:40.402 --> 24:43.370
You gotta keep him under wraps until
we've figured out who ordered this hit.

24:43.437 --> 24:45.472
OK. Will do.

24:45.540 --> 24:48.876
- What, they got him?
- Somebody did. He's dead.

24:48.943 --> 24:51.812
You gotta stick around here
a little while longer.

24:51.880 --> 24:55.215
Well, there's worse places
to stick around.

24:55.283 --> 24:58.617
Tommy, the night of the shooting, are
you sure there's nothing else you saw?

24:58.686 --> 25:00.619
Oz, how many times
do I gotta tell you?

25:00.688 --> 25:02.655
I saw one dude shoot
another dude,

25:02.723 --> 25:04.490
and this dude ran as fast
as my legs could carry me.

25:04.558 --> 25:06.525
Is there something
you're not believing here?

25:06.593 --> 25:08.795
I didn't say that. This is
just moving outside of my area

25:08.862 --> 25:10.997
of expertise. I'm thinking maybe
there's something we missed.

25:11.065 --> 25:13.865
You know what? I'm starving. How
about we get some Chinese food?

25:13.933 --> 25:16.434
How about there are dangerous men
out there trying to kill you?

25:16.502 --> 25:19.171
Yeah, you don't need
to remind me.

25:32.350 --> 25:34.952
- Can I help you?
- I sure hope you can.

25:35.020 --> 25:37.922
My brother was taken in for
a heart attack the other day.

25:37.989 --> 25:41.358
- I'm sorry.
- And he said that the medic who took him saved his life.

25:41.426 --> 25:44.195
He's, uh, medium-tall,
dark hair.

25:44.262 --> 25:48.431
- Oh, Osman Bey, yeah.
- Well, my brother wanted me to give him this as a thank you.

25:48.498 --> 25:51.735
Sorry, we can't accept gifts,
and Oz is off today, so, uh...

25:51.802 --> 25:54.237
I'm sorry, what was
your brother's name again?

25:54.304 --> 25:57.473
Oh, yeah.
It's, uh, Tony. Uh...

25:57.541 --> 25:59.776
I really wanted to say
thank you personally myself

25:59.844 --> 26:03.879
as well, so... maybe I'll just come
back another time, OK? Thank you.

26:03.947 --> 26:07.116
Yeah.

26:07.183 --> 26:09.118
OK, so, I've been looking
deeper into the connection

26:09.185 --> 26:11.286
between Jake and Dom Westing.

26:11.354 --> 26:14.289
And everything just keeps coming
right back to Xander Barkin.

26:14.357 --> 26:16.491
Yeah, but Barkin thought
that he had paid Westing

26:16.559 --> 26:18.893
to get out of town.
Those two weren't tight.

26:18.961 --> 26:22.396
Well, maybe Westing found out what Jake was
doing and tried to get back into Barkin's camp.

26:22.464 --> 26:24.732
But if Westing had just done
a favour for Barkin,

26:24.800 --> 26:27.201
why would he kill him?
That makes no sense.

26:27.269 --> 26:30.104
I don't know how to put this politely, but
you know what doesn't make sense? We're

26:30.172 --> 26:32.140
investigating a double murder
where our only lead is a witness

26:32.207 --> 26:34.674
- that doesn't want to talk to us.
- We bring him in, we're going

26:34.742 --> 26:36.643
to lose him. He's not going
to make an official statement.

26:36.710 --> 26:38.812
Well, the guy's got a history
as a drug addict.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.681
- I'm not sure how much his testimony's even worth.
- I read him. He's clean now.

26:41.749 --> 26:44.317
He saw the murder.
He's a witness.

26:44.385 --> 26:47.254
Maybe there's something
he's not telling us.

26:47.321 --> 26:50.222
Look, Barking didn't know anything about
Jake's murder, but he did know about Westing.

26:50.290 --> 26:53.392
Maybe we can get him on Westing's murder.
If we get nothing,

26:53.459 --> 26:56.494
I'll do my best
to bring Tommy in.

26:56.561 --> 26:59.097
OK. Got a deal.

27:05.938 --> 27:08.072
You people keep coming
back here, you're going to have

27:08.140 --> 27:10.809
to decide whether to order
cocktails or deliver warrants.

27:10.876 --> 27:13.811
I thought you might like to know Don
Westing was murdered this afternoon.

27:13.878 --> 27:16.814
Sucks for him.

27:16.881 --> 27:19.216
Oh, Roughriders are killing me!

27:19.284 --> 27:21.151
A Girl Guide can go
through this defensive line.

27:21.219 --> 27:23.187
You really don't care
that he's dead?

27:23.254 --> 27:26.389
Look, I told you
I knew him in passing.

27:26.457 --> 27:28.424
There's a lot of rounders
like him out there,

27:28.491 --> 27:30.359
and a lot of them get
themselves killed.

27:30.427 --> 27:32.494
It's not like I'm going to go
to his funeral or anything.

27:32.562 --> 27:34.363
<i>Who the hell is hooking me up</i>
<i>with this?</i>

27:34.431 --> 27:36.398
And you had nothing
to do with it?

27:36.466 --> 27:38.400
I've been here
minding my business all day.

27:38.468 --> 27:40.369
And if you two didn't keep
coming around here

27:40.437 --> 27:42.404
with status reports, it wouldn't
even be on my radar.

27:42.472 --> 27:44.672
What about your friend Grant?

27:44.740 --> 27:47.508
You were here
all afternoon too?

27:47.576 --> 27:50.712
I had some, uh,
business of my own.

27:54.283 --> 27:57.785
Now, if you're done, I'd appreciate you walking away.
I've got nothing for you,

27:57.854 --> 28:02.723
my people have got nothing for you, and this
football game is turning into my worst nightmare.

28:02.790 --> 28:04.959
Sucks for you.

28:06.928 --> 28:08.929
So, he was surprised
we were coming after him

28:08.997 --> 28:11.866
- for Westing's murder.
- Is he surprised that he was dead?

28:11.933 --> 28:13.868
- Couldn't tell.
- What about his friend Grant?

28:13.935 --> 28:16.369
He was busy--
with a woman.

28:16.436 --> 28:19.505
I want you to find out what this
idiot Jake got himself killed over,

28:19.573 --> 28:22.008
and why they're
coming after me for it.

28:22.076 --> 28:25.044
I'm on it.

28:25.112 --> 28:27.347
Come on, you're an insult
to the game!

28:27.414 --> 28:30.750
Boy, you are terrible
with chopsticks, man.

28:30.817 --> 28:32.951
How did the people
who came up with rice come up

28:33.019 --> 28:35.553
with chopsticks to eat it?
Doesn't make any sense.

28:35.621 --> 28:37.455
What, are you doing a bit?
That's awful.

28:37.523 --> 28:39.491
Thanks.
I'll be here all week.

28:39.558 --> 28:41.459
Here, try a bit of this one.

28:41.527 --> 28:45.330
- Huh? Oh, yeah.
- Huh?

28:45.398 --> 28:47.766
Yeah. OK,
don't eat all of that.

28:47.833 --> 28:50.201
So, when was the last time
you talked to your parents?

28:50.269 --> 28:52.736
They don't want
to hear from me.

28:52.804 --> 28:55.172
Come on, I can't believe parents
don't want to talk to their own son.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.574
I can't believe it either.
What a couple of jerks, right?

28:59.711 --> 29:01.645
That's screwed up.

29:01.713 --> 29:04.948
So, how about you?
Why'd you become a paramedic?

29:05.016 --> 29:07.918
- Honestly?
One word: Humber River.

29:07.985 --> 29:09.920
That's two words.

29:09.987 --> 29:13.523
- Like "dumb ass".
- You know what I mean, right?

29:13.590 --> 29:16.692
- I think I do.
- We were, what, 10?

29:16.760 --> 29:19.262
We were idiots
to go fishing in that river.

29:19.330 --> 29:24.233
I must have swallowed four gallons of
water before you jumped in to save me.

29:24.301 --> 29:26.735
After that,
I knew I wanted to jump in

29:26.803 --> 29:29.338
- and save people too, so...
- Serious?

29:29.406 --> 29:32.975
- Yeah.
- Well, my last good deed.

29:33.043 --> 29:36.344
- Come on.
- Ozzy, man, I wish I could be more like,

29:36.412 --> 29:40.348
you know, your new buddy, Toby, on the
straight and narrow, always on the up-and-up,

29:40.416 --> 29:43.284
but... it's easy
for a guy like that, you know?

29:43.352 --> 29:45.320
He probably had
all the advantages--

29:45.387 --> 29:47.655
- Hey, Toby's had it tougher
than anybody, OK?

29:47.722 --> 29:51.292
In a WEIRD way. He just never let
it decide who he's gonna be.

29:51.360 --> 29:56.463
Osman Bey!
Metro police! Open the door!

29:56.530 --> 29:59.967
Metro police!

30:00.034 --> 30:02.002
It's probably nothing, OK?
Toby probably sent them.

30:02.070 --> 30:04.237
Let me just go talk to 'em.

30:12.045 --> 30:15.214
Jeez.

30:15.282 --> 30:17.316
OK, I'm gonna call Toby.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.655
Come on.

30:23.723 --> 30:27.459
- Here he comes.
- Go, go, go. Get back, get back, get back, go, go, go.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.894
Tommy.

30:47.168 --> 30:49.019
You know, we would be able
to help you a lot more

30:49.139 --> 30:50.462
if you would just come
into our office.

30:50.565 --> 30:52.933
No. No cops.
I told that to Oz.

30:53.001 --> 30:55.836
- It's not part of the deal.
- I don't know or care what it is you've done

30:55.904 --> 30:57.804
or what warrants are open
for you right now, but there's

30:57.872 --> 31:00.041
a killer out there, and we're
just trying to protect you.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.009
You know everything I know.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.045
Me going down to the cop shop
isn't going to change anything.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.546
Dev, what's going on?

31:06.613 --> 31:08.415
The guy said he was a cop.

31:08.482 --> 31:10.450
I thought maybe you forgot
and you sent him to check on us,

31:10.518 --> 31:13.653
but then he pulled out a lock-pick
and the biggest gun I've ever seen.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.688
You get a good look at the guy?

31:15.756 --> 31:18.624
Yeah. He was a big guy--
not like fat, but... port--

31:18.692 --> 31:21.794
like s--like husky.
- What if I just, you know...?

31:21.862 --> 31:23.763
Just think of the guy,
all right?

31:23.830 --> 31:25.898
OK. Just think
about the guy. That's it?

31:25.966 --> 31:28.701
As far as I know, he's not
someone we've dealt with before.

31:28.769 --> 31:32.104
- OK.
- Hey, Tommy.

31:32.172 --> 31:35.074
- Are you sure there was just one shooter?
- Yes.

31:35.141 --> 31:37.209
One shooter. I've said that
a hundred times. And the guy

31:37.277 --> 31:39.744
who showed up here, I've never
even seen that guy before.

31:39.812 --> 31:42.246
Why are they still after me?

31:42.314 --> 31:45.717
You said that the guy I saw is dead, right?
So I can't hurt them anymore.

31:45.785 --> 31:48.286
Well, someone obviously
doesn't think that.

31:48.353 --> 31:50.254
This is unbelievable!
I'm gonna get killed,

31:50.322 --> 31:52.156
- I don't even know why.
- They've made Oz.

31:52.224 --> 31:54.725
The safest thing for you to do
is come down with us to the IIB.

31:54.793 --> 31:56.493
No. No!

31:56.561 --> 31:58.495
Look, I'm no stranger
to this, Toby.

31:58.563 --> 32:01.799
If I end up in that cop station,
I end up wearing this murder.

32:01.866 --> 32:04.001
Tommy, they're just trying
to help you over here.

32:04.069 --> 32:06.804
- Yeah, sure, Oz, like people have been helping me all along.
- Excuse me?

32:06.871 --> 32:08.772
So, we may have got lucky.
Dev turned up a guy

32:08.840 --> 32:10.773
who placed some bets
with Jake at a bar

32:10.841 --> 32:13.476
called the Cha-Cha Lounge a few
hours before he was killed.

32:13.543 --> 32:15.645
There was a bartender
who was working at the time.

32:15.713 --> 32:17.580
He's bringing him in
for questioning.

32:17.648 --> 32:20.049
OK. That's good.
Hey, Tommy.

32:20.117 --> 32:21.751
All right? Just take--

32:21.819 --> 32:24.386
- Hey, uh, do you know
the Cha-Cha Lounge?

32:24.454 --> 32:26.622
Yeah, it's on Parliament,
right?

32:26.689 --> 32:29.825
Jake Salisbury was drinking there
a few hours before he was killed.

32:29.892 --> 32:33.428
Good, maybe you'll find something out.
Maybe I'll get my life back.

32:33.496 --> 32:36.832
All right, they don't know
you're here, OK? Lay low.

32:36.899 --> 32:39.801
You're safe here. Stay.
Give us a few more hours.

32:39.869 --> 32:41.969
We're going to try
to get you out of this, Tommy.

32:42.037 --> 32:44.605
- Anything's possible, right?
- Yeah.

32:44.673 --> 32:47.842
Thanks.
Thanks, Michelle.

32:50.812 --> 32:52.479
Thank you for coming in.

32:54.850 --> 32:57.651
I don't remember
being given a choice.

32:57.718 --> 33:00.987
This isn't like any cop shop
I've been in before.

33:01.055 --> 33:02.889
Well, we're not regular cops.

33:02.957 --> 33:06.526
So, you were working
at the Cha-Cha Lounge yesterday.

33:06.593 --> 33:09.562
- Recognize that guy?
- Yeah.

33:09.630 --> 33:12.498
He's not a regular,
but I remember him.

33:12.566 --> 33:16.268
He was nervous.
Had a few vodkas straight up.

33:16.335 --> 33:20.305
- You talked to him?
- Nah, he was pretty tight with the guy he was hanging out with.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.340
- He met someone?
- He knew him.

33:22.408 --> 33:25.744
They were thick as thieves.

33:25.812 --> 33:28.113
- That him right there?
- That ain't him.

33:28.181 --> 33:32.216
Guy was... skinny,
kind of skeezy.

33:39.257 --> 33:42.193
OK, well, thank you
for your time.

33:42.260 --> 33:43.960
He'll show you out.

33:49.033 --> 33:53.070
- What'd you see?
- Not what I expected.

33:53.137 --> 33:56.872
Hey, Tommy. Take it easy, man, OK?
Toby said he'd be right back.

33:56.940 --> 33:59.542
Oz, I've tried to be
a good friend to you.

33:59.610 --> 34:01.377
I need you to know that.

34:01.445 --> 34:03.979
OK, I know that tone.

34:04.047 --> 34:07.016
Don't answer that.

34:07.084 --> 34:09.284
It's Toby.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.553
Hey.

34:11.621 --> 34:15.724
Oz, listen to me. Tommy knows Jake.
They were at the bar drinking together.

34:15.791 --> 34:19.628
- What?
<i>- Oz, he's been lying to you,</i>

34:19.696 --> 34:23.197
<i>to me, the whole time.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

34:23.266 --> 34:25.233
<i>I don't know. Just...</i>

34:25.300 --> 34:27.668
keep him there
till we get back, OK?

34:27.735 --> 34:29.770
Yeah, sure.

34:34.109 --> 34:36.877
What's going on, Tommy?

34:36.945 --> 34:38.946
All right, let me explain.

34:39.013 --> 34:41.947
Me and Jake, we scammed a little bit of
money, OK, from a guy that Jake worked for.

34:42.014 --> 34:46.418
And we got busted. Jake talked to the guy.
He said if we gave the money back,

34:46.487 --> 34:49.822
everything was going to be fine, all right?
So we set up a little payoff.

34:49.889 --> 34:52.759
I had to go get my half,
so I was late getting there,

34:52.826 --> 34:57.796
and by the time
I got there, Jake...

34:57.864 --> 34:59.831
The whole thing was Jake's idea.
It wasn't my fault.

34:59.899 --> 35:02.468
It wasn't your fault? What,
a bunch of somebody else's money

35:02.535 --> 35:04.169
just ended up in your pocket
by accident?!

35:04.237 --> 35:06.272
Jake said the whole thing was
going to be safe!

35:06.339 --> 35:09.308
Tommy, life is about choices! Why
do you keep making stupid ones?!

35:09.376 --> 35:11.777
- I-I-I gotta go.
- Tommy, wait.

35:11.844 --> 35:14.912
- No, they're going to be coming for me now, Oz. I gotta go.
- Tommy, I can't let you leave!

35:14.980 --> 35:17.548
Oz! I'm sorry,
I gotta go.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.418
One way or the other,
I'm going.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.853
I'm sorry.

35:22.921 --> 35:25.990
I know you don't believe me.
I'm trying to make this right.

35:47.043 --> 35:50.446
You figure
he's going for the money?

35:50.514 --> 35:52.448
He'd better be.

35:52.516 --> 35:54.550
Barkin's starting
to ask questions.

35:54.618 --> 35:56.652
I need this cleaned up tonight.

36:05.350 --> 36:08.185
I'm sorry that I dragged you into this.
I should never have trusted the guy.

36:08.311 --> 36:11.279
Look, I read him. He seemed
to be telling the truth. - Yeah.

36:11.347 --> 36:14.349
Bear with me for a moment, because
I seem to have lost the plot here.

36:14.416 --> 36:17.785
Dom Westing killed Jake.
But why?

36:17.854 --> 36:20.588
Tommy said that they had stolen money
from a guy that Jake was working for.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.622
That would be Xander Barkin.

36:22.690 --> 36:24.925
Yeah, but when Toby re
Barkin, he didn't have a thought

36:24.993 --> 36:26.994
that he'd done anything
to either Jake or Westing.

36:27.062 --> 36:29.029
Well, that was
the last thing he said

36:29.097 --> 36:31.265
before he pulled a knife on me
in Toby's apartment.

36:31.333 --> 36:33.234
I don't even know
the guy anymore, so...

36:33.301 --> 36:35.635
All right, maybe there's
someone else involved in this

36:35.703 --> 36:39.505
- that we haven't spoken to yet.
- Did he say anything that could tell us where he was going?

36:39.573 --> 36:41.908
No, nothing. I mean, I knew
he was keeping his share

36:41.976 --> 36:44.010
of the money. Maybe he went
somewhere to go get it.

36:44.078 --> 36:46.012
Well, where does a guy
like that go to disappear?

36:46.080 --> 36:48.047
Well, wherever he's heading,
he's going to have a bunch

36:48.115 --> 36:50.516
of killers on his tail.
I'm going to put out an alert.

36:50.584 --> 36:53.952
OK. Thank you.
You know, right until he left,

36:54.020 --> 36:56.821
he said he was still trying to do the right thing.
Can you believe that?

36:56.890 --> 36:58.924
Maybe he was. Humans are
complicated. Let's go.

36:58.992 --> 37:01.826
No, humans are idiots when they believe
humans that are lying to them.

37:01.895 --> 37:03.828
Look, you were
a good friend to him.

37:03.897 --> 37:06.431
You did what you had to do.
He betrayed that trust. OK?

37:06.499 --> 37:09.200
- Look, I gotta get back.
- All right. I'll see you later.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.969
- Yeah. It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah.

37:42.065 --> 37:45.401
<i>Hey, it's Toby.</i>
<i>Leave a message for me.</i>

37:45.468 --> 37:47.769
Hey, Toby, it's me. Um...

37:47.837 --> 37:50.806
Michelle was asking if I knew
where Tommy might be going,

37:50.873 --> 37:53.842
and, uh, this could be
a complete long shot,

37:53.910 --> 37:57.979
but we were talking about the bus station
where we used to hang out when we were kids.

37:58.013 --> 38:01.615
I think he might be trying
to get out of town, so...

38:01.683 --> 38:03.952
I'm going down there
to find him.

38:04.019 --> 38:06.887
I'll call you again if I do.

38:09.992 --> 38:13.360
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>
<i>This is a final call</i>

38:13.428 --> 38:15.362
<i>for Toronto to Thunder Bay.</i>

38:15.430 --> 38:17.464
<i>Stopping at Sudbury...</i>

38:25.473 --> 38:28.842
Is this your idea
of doing the right thing, Tommy?

38:31.044 --> 38:32.911
I gotta go.
They'll never let me live.

38:32.980 --> 38:35.948
Look, if you had trusted me, we
could have got this thing sorted.

38:36.016 --> 38:38.917
You could have given the money back,
we could have put these guys away.

38:38.986 --> 38:41.954
Put these guys away?
That's your world, not mine.

38:42.022 --> 38:45.256
- Tommy, come on.
- Oz, I don't know why you're bother with me right now!

38:45.324 --> 38:47.725
You're right! You're absolutely
right! I'm a total screw-up!

38:47.793 --> 38:49.727
I always have been,
I always will be!

38:49.795 --> 38:51.896
Just because you've made
some bad decisions before

38:51.964 --> 38:54.032
- doesn't mean you have to keep making 'em.
- What's your problem?!

38:54.100 --> 38:56.934
I mean, isn't this what you want? I'm out
of your hair now. I'm out of your life.

38:57.003 --> 38:59.070
I will never ask you
for anything ever again.

38:59.138 --> 39:01.571
I never said I wanted--
Look, just come with me

39:01.639 --> 39:04.108
to the cops, OK?
They can help you.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.177
It's too late.

39:07.245 --> 39:09.013
I got a bus to catch.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.515
Guess what? You already
missed it. I'll take that.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.517
Hey, he's got nothing
to do with this!

39:13.584 --> 39:15.652
Well, he does now.
Get in the car.

39:15.720 --> 39:19.122
- If we get in that car, we're as good as dead.
- I told you to get in the car.

39:19.189 --> 39:22.791
No. You're just gonna
kill us anyways, right?

39:22.859 --> 39:25.794
- Get in the car!
- Oz, go! Go!

39:25.862 --> 39:28.331
Tommy!

39:28.399 --> 39:30.166
IIB! Drop your weapon!

39:39.308 --> 39:42.444
Hold it right there.

39:42.512 --> 39:45.147
Oh, jeez. Here.
Put some pressure on it.

39:45.214 --> 39:48.050
- Hey. How is he?
- I think it's through and through. He's gonna be OK.

39:48.117 --> 39:50.051
- I'll call it in.
- Yeah, OK.

39:50.118 --> 39:52.554
- Come on.
- You know where it is.

39:52.621 --> 39:55.322
- Why did you do that?
- Because he was gonna kill

39:55.390 --> 39:58.159
both of us.
You didn't deserve that.

39:58.226 --> 40:00.294
Gee, Ozzy, I'm sorry.

40:00.362 --> 40:02.730
Just take it easy, all right?
Help's on the way.

40:05.833 --> 40:10.771
You're saying that Barkin's right-hand man
found out that Jake was cheating him,

40:10.838 --> 40:13.839
so he decided to take out Jake
and keep the money for himself.

40:13.907 --> 40:15.908
Right, exactly. And Starr was
gonna let Barkin think

40:15.976 --> 40:19.312
that the money was just lost, as
meanwhile he brought Don Westing back

40:19.380 --> 40:22.615
to take out Jake. - Right. But when Starr
found out we were on to Westing,

40:22.649 --> 40:25.785
- he had him taken out as well.
- See, when I asked Starr about that afternoon,

40:25.852 --> 40:28.455
I got the wrong read because
he didn't kill Westing.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.356
- He ordered Rand to do it.
- Yeah, The other guy from the bus station.

40:31.424 --> 40:33.292
- Right.
- Well, if we're looking

40:33.359 --> 40:35.627
for a new definition
of no honour among thieves,

40:35.695 --> 40:37.662
I think we might have
just found it.

40:42.202 --> 40:45.369
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey. Come on in.

40:45.437 --> 40:48.339
So, am I still, uh,
welcome here?

40:48.407 --> 40:52.042
Well, to be honest, you were never really
welcome; you were just kind of tolerated.

40:52.111 --> 40:56.414
Listen, I'm sorry if I got you in any
trouble with that stuffed shirt, Klein.

40:56.482 --> 40:59.016
Are you kidding me, man?
The bad guys were taken down,

40:59.084 --> 41:01.451
the headlines were secured.
He's a happy guy.

41:01.519 --> 41:04.154
- How's Tommy?
- Oh, Tommy's good.

41:04.222 --> 41:07.690
You know, he's probably scamming the
nurses out of extra Jell-O as we speak.

41:07.758 --> 41:10.193
How are you two?
You guys good?

41:10.261 --> 41:12.195
I appreciate him saving
my life and all, but as far as

41:12.263 --> 41:15.599
us hanging out, I think that's
probably not good for either of us.

41:15.666 --> 41:18.434
Come on, you two must have
got something out of it.

41:18.502 --> 41:20.936
You know, a real friend is
someone who's there for you

41:21.004 --> 41:23.372
to help you as much
as you're there to help them;

41:23.440 --> 41:26.375
a friend who knows that sometimes you don't
have time to go to the grocery store

41:26.443 --> 41:29.845
because, oh, maybe you were holed
up on the run from killers;

41:29.912 --> 41:33.381
a friend who would never let you go hungry.
Know what I mean?

41:33.449 --> 41:35.283
Yeah, I'm not sharing
my food with you.

41:35.351 --> 41:36.784
Is that all
our friendship means to you?

41:36.852 --> 41:39.720
- Pulling that card?
- I'm very disappointed.

41:39.788 --> 41:42.056
It smells so good.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.225
Those puppy-dog eyes.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.327
Pull up a chair. Come on.
Just don't touch the broccoli.

41:46.395 --> 41:48.296
Hey, I don't want
to eat the broccoli.

41:48.364 --> 41:50.264
I got my eye on these peas.
Giddy-up.

41:50.331 --> 41:52.499
I wouldn't
touch the peas either.

41:52.567 --> 41:54.434
- They're not--
- Oh, God, they are not cooked.

41:54.554 --> 41:55.736
Exactly.
