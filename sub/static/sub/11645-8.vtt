00:00.263 --> 00:01.960
This is your chance
to do something positive.

00:02.120 --> 00:04.120
That's what community service
is all about.

00:04.280 --> 00:05.440
What is that?!

00:05.600 --> 00:07.600
Aargh!

00:07.760 --> 00:11.160
He's going to kill us.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.920
You killed our probation worker!

00:13.080 --> 00:14.480
Do you want to go for a drink
with me?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.040
I'm your probation worker.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.040
You were just using me.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.400
She was engaged to Tony,
the first probation worker.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.600
You've killed her!

00:24.760 --> 00:27.120
I didn't mean to kill her!
It was an accident.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.400
- You look like a slut.
- Are you for real?

00:29.560 --> 00:31.763
You don't need to behave like this.

00:31.883 --> 00:34.040
You can be so much better.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.200
Morning!

00:35.360 --> 00:37.200
- They did something to her.
- Like brainwashed her or something?

00:37.360 --> 00:39.960
Everyone was teasing me for being
a virgin. I'm a nice person.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.520
Argh!

00:43.160 --> 00:45.219
What the fuck is going on?

00:45.339 --> 00:47.840
Since when did you run around,
jumping off buildings?!

00:48.000 --> 00:51.720
Ever since I travelled back
from the future.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.160
You can't die!
I love you.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.719
I'll still be here.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.120
- Where did you get that?
- Guy in the mask.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.880
- Who is he?
- It's you.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.722
If you become him,
you're gonna leave me.

01:03.842 --> 01:05.840
You're gonna travel back in time
and you're gonna die.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.840
And if I don't become him and travel
back in time, you're going to die.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.880
Promise me you won't go back.

01:12.235 --> 01:13.235
I promise.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.260
OK.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.980
Now, then. There's someone here...

01:23.100 --> 01:27.000
Someone here for you, madam.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.880
There's a man...

01:29.040 --> 01:31.540
I think he says he misses
your roast dinners.

01:31.660 --> 01:32.780
It's my husband!

01:32.900 --> 01:34.340
He's saying, he's saying...

01:34.460 --> 01:37.340
He's saying something about a ring.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.660
I lost my wedding ring.

01:38.780 --> 01:39.940
A wedding ring.

01:40.060 --> 01:41.000
Thank you.

01:41.352 --> 01:44.600
It's in the U-bend of the
sink of the downstairs bathroom.

01:45.756 --> 01:47.040
OK.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.962
He says don't try and get it out yourself.
You'll make a mess of it.

01:50.082 --> 01:51.320
Get a plumber.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.040
OK. I will.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.076
- OK, OK, come on...
- Thank you.

01:55.196 --> 01:56.940
Thank you, thank you.

01:57.060 --> 01:58.780
Anyone else, anyone else?

01:58.900 --> 02:01.370
I'm getting a message
from the spirit world.

02:01.490 --> 02:03.000
It's for you.

02:06.140 --> 02:07.240
Does the name...

02:08.453 --> 02:12.340
... Sally... mean anything to you?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.620
She wants to know...

02:20.940 --> 02:21.940
... why?

02:23.580 --> 02:27.580
She just has to know why you did it.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
Hello?

03:21.360 --> 03:22.480
You OK?

03:23.580 --> 03:25.480
I think I've just seen a ghost.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.680
Why would there be a goat
in the community centre?

03:27.840 --> 03:31.480
I didn't say a goat, I said a ghost,
like the spirit of a dead person.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.840
That makes more sense.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.900
Who ever heard of a goat, just
hanging out in a community centre?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.801
She was in the corridor.

03:42.921 --> 03:45.160
I think it was Sally,
the probation worker.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.240
Who was that?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.260
Someone who wanted a power.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.460
What, and you sold it to him?

04:58.580 --> 05:01.160
Well, that is what I do.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.680
What?

05:02.840 --> 05:04.540
Your zombie ex-girlfriend tried
to kill me,

05:04.660 --> 05:06.140
and you're still dealing powers
like nothing's happened!

05:06.260 --> 05:08.220
How many times do I have to say
I'm sorry?

05:08.340 --> 05:09.840
This has got nothing to do
with what happened with Shannon.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.560
Do you know what he's gonna do
with the powers?

05:12.720 --> 05:16.160
No. Cos as long as they've got money,
you don't ask questions.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.660
I sold him the power to caffeinate
beverages. It's harmless.

05:18.780 --> 05:22.240
There was a guy who could control
cheese and he was a fucking psycho!

05:22.400 --> 05:24.840
So it's all right when I'm buying
drinks and spending money on you.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.520
- Where do you think it comes from?
- You think I'm with you for money?

05:26.680 --> 05:28.560
No, but I don't think you'd like it
if I didn't have any, would ya?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.400
Girls never do.

05:32.420 --> 05:35.389
- What the fuck's the matter with you?!
- You're a selfish prick.

05:41.235 --> 05:43.780
You killed me. You owe me this.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.360
I've always loved you.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.660
Simon?

05:54.440 --> 05:55.840
Are you all right?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.280
What is it?

05:59.440 --> 06:01.520
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.540
Really?

06:02.660 --> 06:06.040
That makes it sound like you're
going to do something to hurt me.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.440
No.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.220
OK.

06:10.340 --> 06:14.000
Well, try and look less guilty
next time.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.140
Now you're doing your staring thing.

06:16.260 --> 06:19.160
Sorry.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.680
Fuck's sake.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
All right?

06:37.460 --> 06:39.360
- Do you need change?
- What are you doing?

06:39.520 --> 06:40.900
Well, there's no probation worker,

06:41.020 --> 06:43.540
so I thought fuck it, smash your way
into vending machine,

06:43.660 --> 06:46.006
but it's toughened glass!

06:46.126 --> 06:48.760
How desperate do they think people
are to get a Twix?

06:48.920 --> 06:49.920
Stupid.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.553
Bitch!

06:52.700 --> 06:54.120
Just forget about it.

07:04.620 --> 07:05.620
Hi.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.440
You're supposed to be dead.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.976
That medium guy, he brought me back.

07:21.260 --> 07:23.160
It's really good to see you.

07:29.442 --> 07:30.920
And why are you here?

07:34.651 --> 07:36.151
What I did to you...

07:38.540 --> 07:42.080
I shouldn't have betrayed you like
that. I'm so sorry.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.660
I'm sorry I killed you.

07:43.780 --> 07:45.520
I didn't mean to.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.880
No, I know you didn't.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.720
It wasn't meant to be like that.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.780
Everything with Tony and...

07:51.577 --> 07:53.077
my feelings for you.

07:55.180 --> 07:57.040
Maybe that's why I'm here.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.600
I think I've come back for you.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.040
Simon?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.220
Simon, are you in there?

08:08.340 --> 08:09.600
Is that Alisha?

08:10.996 --> 08:12.440
Are you two together?

08:16.100 --> 08:19.167
- How the hell did that happen?
- It's a long story.

08:20.216 --> 08:21.720
What are you doing?

08:23.480 --> 08:24.630
I have to go.

08:28.434 --> 08:29.434
Simon...

08:30.723 --> 08:32.855
Don't tell the others
you've seen me again.

08:33.318 --> 08:34.799
They wouldn't understand.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.472
We'll figure out why I'm here.

08:45.660 --> 08:46.940
Who are you talking to?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.400
No-one. Myself.

08:50.338 --> 08:53.060
You talk to yourself
when you're taking a piss?

08:53.574 --> 08:54.574
Sometimes.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.300
I thought we were going to the shop.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.160
That's him. That's the medium.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.760
You, you fucking twat.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.560
He said that you brought back the
ghost of our dead probation worker.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.720
Hey, what can I say?
I communicate with the spirit world.

09:21.131 --> 09:23.000
You were in that storm, weren't you?

09:23.160 --> 09:24.140
Nope.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.640
Oh, mate, even I know you're lying.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.920
And I thought it were a goat.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.940
I was a complete fraud,
I was making up all kinds of stuff.

09:33.060 --> 09:37.020
Then the storm struck, and I could
actually communicate with spirits.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.720
Sometimes they come back and they're
wandering round like real people.

09:39.880 --> 09:44.206
The first time it happened, it was
this kid, who drowned in a lake.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.720
Spooky little fucker.
Scared the shit out of me!

09:47.880 --> 09:49.400
Why do they come back?

09:49.560 --> 09:52.620
Usually it's because they've got some
unfinished business with the living,

09:52.740 --> 09:56.220
something they need to do before they
pass over into the spirit world.

09:56.340 --> 09:58.620
Some bollocks like that.

09:58.740 --> 10:02.740
So, what's the story with you
and this probation worker?

10:03.720 --> 10:07.620
Have you seen her again
since she first appeared?

10:08.100 --> 10:11.620
No.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.240
OK. Let's see if we can communicate
with her.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.480
Are there any spirits

10:18.640 --> 10:22.120
who wish to communicate with somebody
present in this room?

10:22.660 --> 10:26.320
Is anybody there?

10:28.400 --> 10:32.300
God, I knew this would be
a load of bollocks.

10:35.380 --> 10:39.200
What is this?

10:41.580 --> 10:43.520
Isn't that the girl
who brainwashed us?

10:43.680 --> 10:46.420
That's really impressive.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.040
Only that's the wrong spirit.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.660
What's going on?

10:51.780 --> 10:55.540
It's that dickhead.
He brought you back.

10:55.660 --> 10:59.660
OK. Obviously you've got some issues
to sort out, lots to talk about.

11:00.520 --> 11:04.420
I've got to make some phone calls,
so I'll leave you to it.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.220
I'm Rudy.

11:08.340 --> 11:10.580
Aloha.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.840
It's Hawaiian.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.320
Will someone please tell me
why I'm here?

11:14.480 --> 11:15.760
Really?!

11:15.920 --> 11:18.600
You'd better not be here
to fuck with us again.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.980
Sorry about the whole
brainwashing thing.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.320
Got a little bit carried away.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.080
Hey, don't sweat it.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.960
- It's fine.
- You weren't even there!

11:27.120 --> 11:29.880
Yeah, I know, but you forgive and
you forget, man. And I forgive you.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.280
For what?

11:31.440 --> 11:34.000
For whatever it was
they were talking about.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.120
What's it like? Being dead.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.400
Well, the big news is there's no God.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.320
Ohh, ho-ho!
Thank fuck for that!

11:45.480 --> 11:48.220
I might've done one or two things
that weren't exactly...

11:48.340 --> 11:50.640
Christian in the strictest sense
of the word.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.060
Well, none of it matters anyway,
so...

11:53.180 --> 11:55.520
Yeah, if there's no God.
That's a result.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.440
It's all right for you.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.680
I dedicated my whole life to Him.
I was always so good.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.740
I never swore or drank or took
drugs. I never even kissed a boy.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.960
I was always just worrying about
trying to do the right thing.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.320
What's the right thing? Mm?

12:10.480 --> 12:14.380
You know, is it right to sleep with
your best friend's mother?

12:15.640 --> 12:16.320
No.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.840
So, do you think this is
why you came back,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.480
so you could do some stuff
you missed out on?

12:21.590 --> 12:23.180
Well, you're already dead.

12:23.897 --> 12:26.120
I don't think it could hurt.
You might actually enjoy it.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.460
Would you like to see my penis?

12:31.580 --> 12:34.020
OK.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.480
Yeah.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.600
Fuck, yes!

12:37.760 --> 12:41.580
All right!

12:41.700 --> 12:44.480
I expect we'll have
a few drinks first.

13:05.540 --> 13:06.760
What are you doing here?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.220
Something I want to show you.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.620
Yeah, what's that?

13:09.740 --> 13:12.340
Well, it's better if I show you.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.610
Come on.

13:21.220 --> 13:25.220
What's going on?

13:26.700 --> 13:29.340
I'm quitting dealing.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.940
You were right.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.460
I was behaving like a prick.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.480
I don't want to lose you.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.980
I fancy the arse off you
when you look at me like that.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.960
Dead moody and serious.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.500
Well, that's what I was going for.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.380
So, what are you going to do?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.460
Well, I've got some money
stashed away,

13:47.580 --> 13:49.060
so we could go on that holiday.

13:49.180 --> 13:52.140
Get some sun.

13:52.260 --> 13:53.960
Should've kept the desk.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.880
Why's that?

13:56.040 --> 13:57.550
So we could shag on it.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.820
Hey!

14:39.140 --> 14:41.140
Amazing.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.360
This is fucking brilliant!

14:52.420 --> 14:53.680
What?

15:19.240 --> 15:21.540
Wait!

15:28.160 --> 15:29.200
Oh, Jesus! Oh!

15:30.440 --> 15:31.400
Fuck off!

15:34.940 --> 15:36.459
It's the probation worker.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.320
He's come back from the dead or
something. He's just chased me!

15:40.480 --> 15:43.520
- The first one we killed, he's out there!
- Feel so fucking horny.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.320
Move!

15:48.200 --> 15:50.120
I want you to have sex with me!

15:50.280 --> 15:52.300
Wait!

15:52.420 --> 15:54.760
I'll do that.
I've already got a semi.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.960
Ah!

15:57.600 --> 15:59.080
You!

16:01.000 --> 16:03.600
- You think you can try and kill us again?
- No!

16:03.760 --> 16:05.800
This time, you're going to stay dead!

16:06.440 --> 16:09.720
Stop hitting me!

16:09.880 --> 16:11.480
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- You tried to kill us!

16:11.640 --> 16:12.740
Yeah, I know.

16:12.860 --> 16:16.180
It was the storm. It turned me
psycho. It's not who I am!

16:16.300 --> 16:17.800
Jesus, that hurt!

16:17.960 --> 16:20.739
- So why did you chase me just then?
- I was just trying to talk to you.

16:20.859 --> 16:22.360
Trying to figure out why I'm here.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.062
- You know your girlfriend?
- Sally?

16:24.182 --> 16:26.040
Yeah. She's back, too.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.740
At least, her spirit is.

16:28.860 --> 16:30.380
Sally's dead?

16:30.500 --> 16:34.500
How did she die?

16:35.400 --> 16:36.720
You killed her as well?!

16:36.880 --> 16:38.740
They killed me, too.

16:38.860 --> 16:41.320
I'm a spirit like you.
Can we have sex now, please?

16:41.480 --> 16:44.480
I'm Rudy. I'm new.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.840
Where's Sally?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.140
Will you please have sex with me?

16:48.260 --> 16:50.300
Are you going to shag a ghost?

16:50.420 --> 16:51.960
She's fucking dead!

16:52.120 --> 16:53.360
Only technically.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.800
What would your mam say, eh, if she
knew you were shagging a dead girl?

16:56.960 --> 16:59.560
You're better than that, mate.
I'll do it. Come on.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.319
I must find Sally.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.460
Mmm...

17:16.579 --> 17:18.599
I miss chocolate.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.060
Chocolate and cheese.

17:21.180 --> 17:23.579
French cheese.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.420
I don't suppose you brought
any cheese with you, did you?

17:26.540 --> 17:29.640
They don't have French cheese
in the vending machine.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.540
You're different.

17:36.660 --> 17:39.820
So much more confident.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.640
You used to be so shy,

17:41.800 --> 17:45.280
the way you stared at me
with those big, blue eyes.

17:46.820 --> 17:50.820
I used to be worried about you,
with the others.

17:51.740 --> 17:54.040
A lot happened... since you...

17:54.200 --> 17:58.060
Smashed my head open
on that door handle?

18:00.980 --> 18:04.180
How's the invisibility thing going?

18:04.300 --> 18:07.220
I haven't got it any more.

18:07.340 --> 18:10.020
I can see into the future.

18:10.140 --> 18:14.140
Really?

18:14.980 --> 18:18.860
What's going to happen?

18:18.980 --> 18:22.980
I don't know.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.706
Do you know what else I miss?

18:32.080 --> 18:35.020
Wine.

18:35.140 --> 18:38.280
Come on, let's go get
a bottle of wine.

18:40.706 --> 18:41.706
Come on.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.820
Look, you killed me
and put me in that freezer.

18:45.940 --> 18:49.940
The least you can do
is have a drink with me.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.620
Sally?

19:13.460 --> 19:17.440
All right?

19:19.600 --> 19:23.460
That was fucking brilliant.

19:59.580 --> 20:00.840
Simon?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.860
I've been thinking some more
about why I'm here.

20:05.260 --> 20:08.720
What I felt for you, it was genuine.

20:09.980 --> 20:13.980
I wasn't just using you.

20:14.340 --> 20:17.620
What is it?

20:17.740 --> 20:19.840
I had a vision of the future.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.900
What did you see?

20:24.020 --> 20:25.320
Simon, please.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.560
I need to figure out why I'm here.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.180
We...

20:31.300 --> 20:35.300
We were kissing.

20:37.620 --> 20:41.140
Then that must be it.

20:41.260 --> 20:44.500
That's what I'm supposed to do.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.740
You can't.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.040
I'm with Alisha.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.352
She'll never know.

20:48.472 --> 20:50.660
She'll never find out.
I would've passed on.

20:50.780 --> 20:54.660
I'll know!

20:54.780 --> 20:56.660
You've seen this.

20:56.780 --> 21:00.780
You know this is supposed to happen.

21:02.900 --> 21:06.680
I still have feelings for you.
I need to prove that to you.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.980
I need to move on.

21:09.100 --> 21:13.100
I can't.

21:14.780 --> 21:18.440
You killed me.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.460
You owe me this.

21:34.460 --> 21:38.460
Do it for me.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.120
I've always loved you.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.860
Right, take it right down
into your lungs...

22:57.481 --> 22:58.781
... and hold it.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.740
Hold it.

23:05.095 --> 23:05.960
Hold it.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.900
Got to let all the lovely goodness
sink in.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.540
And... breathe.

23:15.740 --> 23:17.180
I feel really fucking weird.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.220
Yeah.

23:18.340 --> 23:21.420
I'm guessing that's the E
I sprinkled in there.

23:21.540 --> 23:22.880
So enjoy that.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.860
Hmm.

23:26.980 --> 23:30.197
- What are you doing?
- We are relaxing.

23:30.317 --> 23:33.140
Haven't head office sent another
probation worker to replace Sally?

23:33.260 --> 23:34.880
Yeah, they sent someone.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.680
Got stabbed to death by a coma girl
who body-swapped with Kelly.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.200
Shit happens.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.440
The one they sent to replace him,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.660
she got attacked
by a zombie cheerleader.

23:44.780 --> 23:47.020
He battered her to death
with a baseball bat.

23:47.140 --> 23:50.120
Mmm. She had a shocker of a day.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.520
What happened to the vending machine?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.438
Oh, that's a funny thing, that.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.204
I was carrying the fire extinguisher

23:57.681 --> 23:59.820
and I tripped and fell into it,

23:59.940 --> 24:02.120
repeatedly.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.660
I'm off my fucking tits!

24:05.780 --> 24:09.260
Look at you. You're out of control.

24:09.380 --> 24:12.220
Completely immoral. You're feral.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.600
Right.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.180
All we have ever done is defend
ourselves from you

24:19.300 --> 24:21.720
and every other fucker
that's tried to kill us.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.400
We've done our best,

24:23.560 --> 24:25.960
and if you've got a problem
with that, then fuck you!

24:26.120 --> 24:28.040
Like you're so perfect?!

24:28.200 --> 24:30.020
Sort your own shit out.

24:30.140 --> 24:32.520
I think we've done all right,
considering.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.795
I think we've done
more than all right, love.

24:37.620 --> 24:40.060
Free chocolate!

24:40.180 --> 24:41.840
I've got to find Sally.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.720
'I've always loved you.'

25:35.460 --> 25:38.460
How could you do that to me?

25:38.580 --> 25:42.080
You had sex with her... in our bed.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.480
And... you send me a video of it.
Why would you do that?!

25:46.640 --> 25:50.060
It's not what you think.
I didn't have sex with her!

25:50.180 --> 25:53.400
- I thought I was supposed to...
- You were supposed to cheat on me?!

25:54.500 --> 25:57.080
- I was... I was trying to help...
- I trusted you!

25:57.240 --> 25:59.100
You can't do this!

26:00.040 --> 26:02.120
Alisha... I'm sorry, I...

26:02.280 --> 26:04.500
Don't fucking touch me!

26:04.620 --> 26:06.060
It's not what you think.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.400
It's complicated.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.900
No, it isn't.

26:11.020 --> 26:15.020
Alisha!

26:19.148 --> 26:19.960
You?

26:21.600 --> 26:23.640
Jesus!

26:24.480 --> 26:28.040
Will you... just stop hitting me!

26:28.200 --> 26:30.900
♪ ENYA: Orinoco Flow

26:31.020 --> 26:33.120
So you met
the old probation worker, then?

26:33.280 --> 26:34.365
Yeah, we've met.

26:34.485 --> 26:35.560
What's going on?

26:35.720 --> 26:37.660
He's back, too. Seems OK.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.040
Where've you been?

26:39.200 --> 26:43.060
There was something I had to...

26:43.740 --> 26:44.760
Whoa!

26:44.920 --> 26:46.400
... do.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.640
Whoa, man, she's just been sick!

26:48.800 --> 26:51.440
Has anyone seen Alisha?

27:00.100 --> 27:04.180
Hurts, doesn't it?

27:04.300 --> 27:05.920
Why are you doing this?

27:06.080 --> 27:09.700
You killed Tony.

27:09.820 --> 27:13.000
I want Simon to know how it feels
to lose everything.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.560
And I want him to know
that you died hating him!

27:23.920 --> 27:24.920
Sally!

27:27.940 --> 27:30.560
Don't do this. Let her go.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.740
They killed you.

27:34.860 --> 27:38.860
It was the storm. Turned me crazy.

27:39.900 --> 27:43.020
You always said I had a temper.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.980
I attacked them.
I would've killed them.

27:46.100 --> 27:50.100
It was self-defence.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.760
This isn't why you're here.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.820
You're not here for revenge.

27:55.940 --> 27:59.940
Let her go.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.760
I have missed you so much.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.780
I never thought I'd see you again!

28:30.860 --> 28:32.280
I didn't have sex with her.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.240
I saw you.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.420
I kissed her.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.900
I thought I had to
because I killed her.

28:40.020 --> 28:42.840
As I was kissing her,
all I could think about was you.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.440
I never want to be with anyone else.

28:45.600 --> 28:49.460
Kissing her only made me realise
how much I love you.

28:52.060 --> 28:56.040
I couldn't go through with it.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.620
Great speech, and all that.
Very moving.

29:16.740 --> 29:20.500
But he definitely should've fucked
that probation worker.

29:20.620 --> 29:24.620
That's a wasted opportunity, innit?

29:24.940 --> 29:28.940
Where are we going?

29:33.180 --> 29:37.100
What's going on?

29:37.220 --> 29:40.020
What's with all the tears?

29:40.140 --> 29:42.510
I did everything
I thought I was supposed to do.

29:44.780 --> 29:48.460
Got drunk, I took drugs.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.240
I had sex.
And I've sworn like a cunt.

29:51.400 --> 29:55.220
And I'm still here -
I haven't moved on.

29:55.340 --> 29:59.340
And now I just feel cheap and dirty.

30:01.180 --> 30:05.180
I feel sick and horrible.
I just want to know why I'm here.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.620
Well, I think that takes
a bit of working out.

30:11.740 --> 30:14.620
You know the attractive older
probation worker

30:14.740 --> 30:16.180
that the starey guy...

30:16.300 --> 30:17.520
didn't have sex with?

30:18.040 --> 30:20.940
Yeah, well, she thought
she was here for revenge, you know,

30:21.060 --> 30:23.220
cos the others had killed her
and everything.

30:23.340 --> 30:26.320
- Some spirits come back for revenge?
- Yeah, but not her.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.500
Turns out she came back
to hook up with her...

30:28.620 --> 30:32.620
boyfriend, which is actually
quite sweet and moving.

30:33.060 --> 30:37.060
If you like that sort of thing.

30:37.700 --> 30:39.180
Look at you.

30:39.300 --> 30:43.300
You're so beautiful.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.900
No! No, no... you smell of sick.
No, thank you.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.900
Poor thing, she's in a right mess.
Shall I make her a cup of tea?

32:28.020 --> 32:30.620
Do ghosts even like tea? Do they...?
Ooh.

32:31.580 --> 32:34.020
Are you all right?

32:34.140 --> 32:35.440
You killed me.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.460
And then you turned me
into a nasty little slut.

32:39.700 --> 32:40.720
Like you.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.880
There's nothing wrong with us, mate.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.087
You're the one
with sick down your top.

32:45.207 --> 32:47.160
You're everything I always hated.

32:48.420 --> 32:50.400
Whoa!

32:50.560 --> 32:52.960
What are you doing?

32:53.120 --> 32:56.980
This is why I came back.

32:58.399 --> 33:00.800
- Revenge.
- Listen, you don't mean that.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.920
Yeah? I thought we were all going to
be friends here, weren't we?

33:04.080 --> 33:07.000
Let's not do this. Eh?
Just put it down...

33:15.540 --> 33:17.377
No!

33:21.040 --> 33:24.520
Get an ambulance! No...

33:24.680 --> 33:25.840
Oh, Jesus!

33:26.000 --> 33:29.860
Please, no!

33:32.620 --> 33:36.600
Alisha, no.

33:37.860 --> 33:39.321
No...

33:43.980 --> 33:50.000
No!

34:34.870 --> 34:38.870
I can bring her back.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.110
If that's what you want?

34:42.230 --> 34:43.920
She's dead.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.239
She wouldn't want to be a zombie.

34:46.400 --> 34:50.310
Don't. Don't do that.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.239
This is where I go back.

34:55.400 --> 34:59.310
It all has to happen
exactly like it happened.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.270
What are you talking about?

35:04.390 --> 35:07.670
It was me.

35:07.790 --> 35:11.790
I was the guy in the mask.

35:12.070 --> 35:13.400
You're fucking serious?

35:13.560 --> 35:14.390
But...

35:14.510 --> 35:16.190
but you were there when...

35:16.310 --> 35:19.950
when he was there.

35:20.070 --> 35:24.070
At the start, it was my future self.

35:25.470 --> 35:28.270
He died...

35:28.390 --> 35:32.390
... and I became him.

35:38.230 --> 35:42.320
I'm going to need to get
some new powers.

35:50.710 --> 35:54.520
Kelly said you wanted to see me.

35:58.030 --> 36:02.030
I need Curtis's old power.

36:04.030 --> 36:07.920
I put it in my iguana. He's dead.
The power's gone.

36:16.190 --> 36:18.470
I have to go back in time.

36:18.590 --> 36:22.110
It has to be like this.

36:22.230 --> 36:23.870
Right, well...

36:23.990 --> 36:28.070
There is another time travel power
out there.

36:28.190 --> 36:31.960
I sold it to this guy.
It's different to what he had.

36:34.160 --> 36:38.070
There's no coming back.

36:39.710 --> 36:43.800
Who did you sell it to?

36:52.070 --> 36:55.800
You all right?

37:01.333 --> 37:03.023
Can I tell you a secret?

37:04.990 --> 37:07.550
You know these powers?

37:07.670 --> 37:10.550
Well, I'm a fucking rocket scientist.

37:10.670 --> 37:11.830
Me too!

37:11.950 --> 37:14.630
I mean, I've got a power.

37:14.750 --> 37:17.390
I got it off this guy
from the estate.

37:17.510 --> 37:19.760
I'm gonna travel back in time.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.510
No way!
Seriously.

37:22.630 --> 37:25.070
I am done working in a call centre.

37:25.190 --> 37:29.190
I want excitement and adventures.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.030
I'm gonna travel back in time...

37:32.150 --> 37:34.870
and become a pirate.

37:34.990 --> 37:38.040
I've always wanted to shag a pirate.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.350
What's this?

37:49.470 --> 37:52.480
- What's going on?
- I was lying about shagging a pirate.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.880
Seriously. Who would fuck a pirate?!

37:55.040 --> 37:56.350
They get laid all the time.

37:56.470 --> 37:58.160
You know that power I sold you?

37:58.320 --> 38:00.190
Turns out I'm going to need it back.

38:00.310 --> 38:01.600
You can't have it.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.670
I paid for it.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.910
I need that power.

38:16.550 --> 38:18.560
So, you all set?

38:20.030 --> 38:22.280
In the past, I could touch Alisha.

38:24.230 --> 38:26.240
The power didn't work on me.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.790
It was you.

38:28.910 --> 38:30.310
What was him?

38:30.430 --> 38:33.830
The first power I ever sold was the
immunity from other people's powers.

38:33.950 --> 38:36.600
You came to see me.
I knew I recognised you.

38:37.670 --> 38:39.520
I sold it to you.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.030
And you gave me ten grand.

38:42.150 --> 38:44.550
Now, you need to come and see me
after you go back.

38:44.670 --> 38:48.670
I don't have ten grand.

38:48.950 --> 38:51.870
I do.

38:51.990 --> 38:54.350
You're gonna give him ten grand?

38:54.470 --> 38:57.720
Yeah, well, he's gonna give it me
back, so... I guess it's a loan.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.590
Just go back and make Alisha fall in
love with you all over again.

40:28.710 --> 40:30.040
Promise me, yeah?

40:31.565 --> 40:33.132
I promise.

40:38.710 --> 40:40.110
I'll see you soon.

40:56.830 --> 40:58.310
That ain't normal.

40:58.430 --> 41:00.680
She went to my school.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.360
This one time, she's doing this boy
I know in the back of her dad's car.

41:03.520 --> 41:08.640
She gets off him and sits
on the gear stick.

41:08.800 --> 41:14.400
She's on there for, like,
20 minutes, literally... uh-uh-uh!

41:14.560 --> 41:16.560
Uh-uh-uh!

41:16.720 --> 41:18.920
Uh-uh-uh!

41:19.080 --> 41:20.840
Uh-uh-uh!

41:21.000 --> 41:24.910
Uh-uh-uh! Uh-uh-uh!

41:26.750 --> 41:30.390
Try that in your driving test.
You are definitely getting a fail.

41:30.510 --> 41:35.160
Or a pass. And maybe some kind of
internal injury.

42:33.407 --> 42:35.280
Can I help you with something?

42:36.509 --> 42:38.200
I want to buy a power.

42:40.790 --> 42:44.390
Well, what sort of thing are you
after?

42:44.510 --> 42:47.790
I want the immunity
to other people's powers.

42:47.910 --> 42:49.590
How do you know what...?

42:49.710 --> 42:53.400
I just bought that exact power.
How do you even know about me?

42:55.560 --> 42:57.960
A friend told me to come and see you.

42:59.248 --> 43:00.628
You got money?

43:12.510 --> 43:13.960
That should cover it.

43:17.706 --> 43:19.320
So, what are you going to do with it?

43:21.910 --> 43:24.006
I'm going to make a girl
fall in love with me.

44:00.550 --> 44:02.550
Right, so, hang on...

44:02.670 --> 44:07.355
So he's got to go back in time, he's
got to fall in love with Alisha...

44:08.510 --> 44:10.550
... then she dies

44:10.670 --> 44:14.280
and they're gonna be stuck doing it
over and over again, for all eternity?

44:14.440 --> 44:16.680
I think it's dead romantic.

44:16.840 --> 44:20.750
Is it, though?! Are we supposed
to feel - happy or sad?

44:22.070 --> 44:23.440
It's a bit of both.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.200
Right.

44:26.360 --> 44:29.670
So...

44:34.480 --> 44:38.470
I'm not very good with your mixed
emotions. I'm just going with happy.

44:38.590 --> 44:41.600
We're never gonna see them again,
are we?

44:41.760 --> 44:43.122
What's the matter with you?

44:43.242 --> 44:45.360
You really know how to bring a man
down, don't you, eh?

44:52.550 --> 44:54.150
So, what do we do now?

44:55.070 --> 44:56.230
Keep our heads down,

44:56.350 --> 44:59.760
finish community service
and live happily ever after.

45:00.301 --> 45:02.480
Yeah, well, I love a happy ending.
