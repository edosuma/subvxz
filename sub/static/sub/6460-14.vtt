Thank you for losing
all your money so Hollywood

would buy your story and
I could buy all the pot I want.

You're just in time

the pot sitch out here.

it's high-larious.

you pot cards out here.

"Sure, I get sad."

Hey, I'm an 80-year-old man
working at a dead-end diner.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.764
