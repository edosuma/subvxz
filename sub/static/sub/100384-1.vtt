WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.304
Ride along with the heroes
of 9-1-1 Lone Star.

00:03.337 --> 00:04.338
Let's show 'em what we got!

00:04.372 --> 00:06.040
See all-new episodes
Mondays.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.008
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.042 --> 00:10.010
Prodigal Son, 9-1-1
and Deputy.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.679
You need three things
to do this job--

00:11.712 --> 00:14.082
a badge, a gun
and what's in your heart.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER: Only on Fox.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.987
ANNOUNCER: So it's all down
to this, folks.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.190
A&M's last chance to save
their season.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.192
The Aggies are in
field goal range

00:24.225 --> 00:26.727
with four seconds remaining
in the fourth quarter.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.898
Their kicker is 17 for 25
for field goals on the season.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.734
The snap is good, kick is up,
through the uprights!

00:33.767 --> 00:36.070
A&M gets three.
We're going into overtime.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.339
NIGHT WATCHMAN: Whoo-whoo!

00:38.372 --> 00:40.908
(dramatic rock music)

00:40.941 --> 00:45.713
*

00:45.746 --> 00:47.881
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.251
Ah!
(blowing)

00:52.720 --> 00:54.122
Oh, kick me!

00:59.793 --> 01:01.929
The flames!
The flames are moving fast!

01:01.962 --> 01:03.397
Just stay calm, sir.
Where are you?

01:03.431 --> 01:05.065
NIGHT WATCHMAN: I'm at
the Farm and Feed Factory,

01:05.099 --> 01:06.367
off Old Walker Road.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.270
I'm in the kitchen
in the main building and--

01:10.904 --> 01:12.140
I'm so fired.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.742
GRACE: 126, please be advised,

01:14.775 --> 01:16.477
caller is trapped
in the break room

01:16.510 --> 01:18.212
in the center of the compound.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.914
Dispatch, this is Engine 126.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.616
This place is going up
like a tinderbox.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.585
We are talking about at least
a four-alarm.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.086
GRACE: Okay, y'all take care
of yourselves out there,

01:26.120 --> 01:27.087
you hear?

01:27.121 --> 01:28.122
All right, keep it at the base!

01:28.156 --> 01:29.290
Hold on to it!

01:29.323 --> 01:31.091
(coughing)

01:31.125 --> 01:32.760
Watch your step.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.094
Help!
Over here!

01:34.128 --> 01:35.429
(shouting indistinctly)

01:35.463 --> 01:37.765
We got another one!
We got another one!

01:37.798 --> 01:39.967
Hey, up there, got all
that water in the tower.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.503
Yo, Garrity.
Hit it with everything you got.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.937
MAN: I can't get down
from here!

01:43.971 --> 01:46.274
Right at the base!

01:46.307 --> 01:48.676
Harkes, we need more pressure.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.077
We're almost dry, sir.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.579
What's going on?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.614
Hey, Cap, I think I remember
seeing a hydrant on the map

01:53.647 --> 01:55.449
about a hundred yards that way.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.185
If I can run
a four-inch line to it,

01:57.218 --> 01:58.419
we could have a fair fight.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.020
Get 'er done.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.289
All right, stepping off.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.923
Hey!

02:02.956 --> 02:05.092
Y'all be ready
to hold on tight!

02:05.125 --> 02:08.429
(dramatic music)

02:08.462 --> 02:14.968
*

02:24.044 --> 02:25.112
All right!

02:25.145 --> 02:26.547
Yeah!
(laughs)

02:26.580 --> 02:27.948
Take that!

02:27.981 --> 02:31.252
(all cheering)

02:32.753 --> 02:34.955
All right!

02:34.988 --> 02:37.024
GRACE: Come in 126,
do you copy?

02:37.057 --> 02:39.660
Dispatch, this is 126.
What's up?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.895
We just got a call in Spanish
from a maintenance man.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.831
Said they store fertilizer,
ammonium nitrate,

02:43.864 --> 02:45.366
in that facility.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.634
Y'all need to pull
those men back.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.036
Hey, Engine 126!

02:49.069 --> 02:51.872
Engine 126, fall back!

02:51.905 --> 02:54.141
Fall back!
Fall back!

02:54.174 --> 02:55.709
(screaming)

02:58.512 --> 03:05.018
*

03:05.052 --> 03:07.221
Ladder 126, do you copy?

03:07.255 --> 03:13.060
*

03:13.093 --> 03:17.331
GRACE: Ladder 126,
please respond.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.567
Ladder 126!

03:19.600 --> 03:24.204
*

03:24.238 --> 03:26.340
Ladder 126.

03:26.374 --> 03:29.310
*

03:34.448 --> 03:37.217
I'm gonna ask Alex
to marry me tonight.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.956
Dad, please don't say anything
negative, all right?

03:42.990 --> 03:44.725
I already bought the ring.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.960
How about moving in together
first?

03:46.994 --> 03:49.096
Grand gestures, right?
Isn't that what you always say?

03:49.129 --> 03:50.431
Big swings?

03:50.464 --> 03:52.266
I've also been divorced twice.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.804
New York Fire.
We're here to help.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.473
MAN: Help!
Someone, help!

03:59.507 --> 04:02.410
Come on, help me up!

04:02.443 --> 04:05.913
Get me down from here, please!
Get me out of here!

04:05.946 --> 04:08.916
Oh, God, I love New York.

04:08.949 --> 04:12.586
Please!
Help, help!

04:12.620 --> 04:15.423
So, uh, you gonna tell me

04:15.456 --> 04:17.090
what you really think
about this proposal,

04:17.124 --> 04:19.159
or are you just gonna
keep pretending

04:19.192 --> 04:20.528
that you don't have an opinion?

04:22.430 --> 04:24.865
You're an adult,
you think it's right...

04:26.967 --> 04:28.469
I say go for it.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.603
Really?

04:29.637 --> 04:31.271
Yeah.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.006
Thanks, Dad.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.976
(coughing)

04:36.009 --> 04:37.578
Hey, you okay?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.680
Yeah, it's some viral thing
I can't kick.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.582
I'm gonna go to the doctor,
get some antibiotics.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.650
All right.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.118
Hey.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.887
I'm happy for you.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.764
DOCTOR: These are tumors.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.098
They're stage 1B,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.100
which means they haven't spread
to your lymph nodes,

05:00.133 --> 05:01.101
which is very fortunate.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.003
We caught it early.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.005
Lung cancer?

05:05.038 --> 05:08.642
But I had a chest x-ray
last year.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.879
You were at ground zero when
the buildings came down, yes?

05:13.881 --> 05:14.982
Yeah.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.183
Then I don't have to tell you

05:16.216 --> 05:17.651
by the 20th anniversary
of 9/11,

05:17.685 --> 05:20.220
more survivors who were there
that day and during the cleanup

05:20.253 --> 05:22.990
will get sick or die than
people killed on 9/11 itself.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.627
This is gonna kill me,
isn't it?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.729
If you're going to get
a diagnosis like this,

05:28.762 --> 05:30.764
it's the best-case scenario.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.568
-Can I work?
-Yes.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.736
But here's my advice:

05:35.769 --> 05:37.505
Don't worry about
the physical parts of this.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.508
You're young and strong.
The numbers are on your side.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.209
It's the psychological part
of the diagnosis

05:42.242 --> 05:43.677
that trips most people up.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.680
Let this be an opportunity
to look at your life,

05:46.714 --> 05:48.916
your work, your relationships,

05:48.949 --> 05:50.851
and make sure they're all
you want them to be.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.054
My son's getting engaged
tonight.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.589
Will I make it to the wedding?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.157
I don't like to give timelines,

05:57.190 --> 06:00.428
but we will do everything
we can to make sure you do.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.430
(scoffs)

06:02.463 --> 06:08.536
*

06:28.321 --> 06:29.757
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:29.790 --> 06:36.730
*

06:41.101 --> 06:42.736
This is nice.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.906
Yeah, I wanted some place
really nice.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.242
So I wanted to talk to you
about something.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.913
-So do I.
-Let me go first.

06:52.946 --> 06:53.914
Um...

06:53.947 --> 07:00.821
*

07:03.791 --> 07:06.794
BETH: Captain Strand.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.962
We were about to give up
on you.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.731
Beth Healy
with the Department of Justice.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.799
We were supposed
to meet at nine?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.267
Yes, we spoke on the phone.
So sorry.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.303
This is Deputy Fire Chief
Alden Radford

07:16.336 --> 07:17.771
from Austin, Texas.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.839
Welcome to New York.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.973
Thank you.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.275
BETH: What is that,
a meteorite?

07:22.309 --> 07:24.177
That's a reminder.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.179
It's from the South Tower.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.515
The, uh--

07:27.548 --> 07:30.651
the heat was so intense,
it melted metal,

07:30.684 --> 07:33.453
and the guys from this house
went in anyway.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.589
That's the standard
they set for us here.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.525
RADFORD: Captain Strand,

07:37.558 --> 07:40.160
I believe that you're aware
of the tragedy

07:40.193 --> 07:41.995
that happened
in our department?

07:42.029 --> 07:43.697
Yes, I am.
I'm very sorry.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.198
We want you to come down
to Texas

07:45.232 --> 07:48.001
and do for Austin
what you did here.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.670
No one has ever built

07:49.703 --> 07:51.805
an entire house from scratch
before.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.841
But you have, Captain,

07:53.874 --> 07:55.075
after 9/11.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.813
Why is the Department
of Justice involved in this?

07:59.847 --> 08:02.816
There was a bit of an
inclusivity issue down there.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.652
Civil Rights division
got involved,

08:04.685 --> 08:05.886
so we had to step in.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.221
Four years later,
it's getting better.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.290
RADFORD: There are
48 firehouses in Austin,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.993
35 of them have made
meaningful changes.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.162
We take this issue
very seriously.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.731
Hasn't been easy.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.567
Well, I'm flattered,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.869
but if you're gonna
put diversity first,

08:21.902 --> 08:25.472
shouldn't you hire somebody
who's, you know, diverse?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.575
We need someone like you.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.677
An outsider who truly
understands

08:29.710 --> 08:33.080
how much rebuilding this house
is gonna heal the community.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.587
Look, I appreciate the offer,

08:39.620 --> 08:41.254
but I was born in Santa Monica,

08:41.288 --> 08:43.056
I moved to New York
when I was 15,

08:43.090 --> 08:45.025
I have lived here ever since.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.127
My son is here.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.230
I mean,
I appreciate the offer,

08:50.263 --> 08:52.600
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to decline.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.404
All right.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.373
I tell you what,

09:00.407 --> 09:02.710
why don't you--

09:02.743 --> 09:05.613
why don't you give me a call
if you ever change your mind?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.948
Will do.

09:07.981 --> 09:14.955
*

09:20.293 --> 09:22.262
Hey, do you know where TK is?

09:22.295 --> 09:24.632
We thought you could tell us.
He hasn't come in yet.

09:24.665 --> 09:30.638
*

09:30.671 --> 09:33.073
(doorbell beeping)

09:36.343 --> 09:38.245
(door buzzes)

09:38.278 --> 09:39.246
(knocking)

09:39.279 --> 09:41.982
TK!
Open the door!

09:45.152 --> 09:46.419
Yeah, it's Captain Strand.

09:46.453 --> 09:49.322
I need the ladder ambulance
at 2735 West 7th,

09:49.356 --> 09:51.324
apartment 105.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.061
And bring the battering ram.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.195
TK?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.132
TK!

09:59.166 --> 10:01.368
TK!

10:08.642 --> 10:10.477
(radio chatter)

10:10.510 --> 10:12.079
He's in cardiac arrest.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.514
OFFICER: Get the EMTs
over here now.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.449
Sir, you should let us
take over.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.085
Give me the Narcan!

10:18.118 --> 10:20.688
(dramatic music)

10:20.721 --> 10:27.527
*

10:39.840 --> 10:41.942
Dad.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.276
-Dad.
-It's okay.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.113
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay, it's okay.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.781
OWEN: Damn it, TK,
you promised me

10:47.815 --> 10:49.082
this would never happen again.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.954
Where'd you get the pills?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.289
Come on, Dad--I mean,
there's an opioid epidemic.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.691
I mean, you could throw a stick

10:57.725 --> 10:59.860
and you'll hit ten guys
selling Oxys.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.294
Is this your first relapse?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.730
Is there something you want
to tell me?

11:02.763 --> 11:06.166
No, I haven't touched a pill
in years.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.002
I swear.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.907
Were you trying
to kill yourself?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.709
No.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.948
He's in love
with somebody else.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.785
And that's why
he's been acting weird.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.422
A Spin Cycle instructor
named Mitchell.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.525
(somber music)

11:32.559 --> 11:33.493
*

11:33.526 --> 11:34.762
I'm sorry.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.267
Are you gonna have
to report this now?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.237
We used the battering ram.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.039
The whole crew was there.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.942
The last thing I need right now
is to be suspended.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.382
I'll report it
as an accidental overdose.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.417
That'll satisfy them.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.055
But it won't satisfy me.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.757
It is tough love from now on.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.725
You want out of this?

12:05.759 --> 12:07.560
You do this my way.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.596
Therapy, twice a week,

12:09.629 --> 12:11.965
with a therapist that I choose.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.870
And pack your stuff.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.772
We're getting out of town.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.942
TK: Dad, please, I am not
in the mood for a vacation.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.046
I'm not talking
about a vacation.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.582
* I used to love
to look for a fight *

12:29.616 --> 12:33.720
* Never thought

12:33.753 --> 12:35.789
* It would happen to me

12:35.823 --> 12:38.792
(Chris Stapleton's
"Hard Livin'")

12:38.826 --> 12:40.060
*

12:40.093 --> 12:44.397
* But this hard living

12:44.431 --> 12:46.466
* Ain't easy
as it used to be *

12:46.499 --> 12:50.470
*

12:53.306 --> 12:56.276
(somber country music)

12:56.309 --> 13:03.216
*

13:29.910 --> 13:31.644
OWEN: This place
is exactly like it was

13:31.678 --> 13:33.346
the night the call came in.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.983
They shuttered it the next day.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.751
It's like a tomb.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.556
Dad, tell them you change
your mind.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.959
We--we don't belong here.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.627
We were invited here.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.898
Yeah, not by anyone
grieving the loss of those men.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.365
I mean, they're not even ready

13:52.399 --> 13:54.367
to get rid of the dead flowers
on the sidewalk.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.702
And now what,
some city slicker's

13:55.735 --> 13:57.404
gonna come in here
and scold them

13:57.437 --> 13:58.805
on how they're doing life
all wrong?

13:58.838 --> 13:59.907
City slicker?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.876
An outsider.
A stranger.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.811
Sometimes it takes an outsider.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.047
Someone they can blame,

14:07.080 --> 14:08.982
and possibly hate.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.085
Just don't go out of your way
to prove the point, okay?

14:12.119 --> 14:13.753
You know me.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.855
I tread very lightly.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.591
So, is this in the budget?

14:18.625 --> 14:19.927
I find people work better

14:19.960 --> 14:22.062
in spaces where there's
more natural light.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.430
What you got there?

14:23.463 --> 14:24.731
Resumes.
Yep.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.566
They've been coming in
from all over the state.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.068
Got a lot of good people here.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.203
This one here,
that is my past--

14:30.237 --> 14:31.838
Uh, who's he?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.340
Oh, that's Mateo.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.575
Frequent flyer in the academy.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.744
Never passed,
but he's a good kid,

14:37.777 --> 14:40.580
so I hired him as my driver.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.881
All right, Chief.

14:41.915 --> 14:45.052
Well, I will look
at your resumes.

14:45.085 --> 14:49.022
I'm casting
a slightly wider net.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.924
This crew can't
just be good.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.425
They gotta be the best.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.427
Gotta be the 1927 Yankees.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.096
No one's gonna cut us
any slack.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.430
We need exceptional people.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.599
Gotta be battle tested.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.102
But this chick just seems
kind of crazy.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.436
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.737
CAPTAIN:
This is Captain Triplet

15:04.771 --> 15:06.239
from Ladder 106 Miami FD.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.907
We're still waiting
on that marine unit.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.709
We got two civilians
in the water.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.412
OFFICER: What the hell do you
think you're doing, Marjan?

15:12.445 --> 15:13.446
No!

15:13.480 --> 15:15.615
* All you got is this moment

15:15.648 --> 15:18.051
Miami Fire and Rescue
Instagram got, what,

15:18.085 --> 15:19.152
6 million likes now?

15:19.186 --> 15:20.120
Nine.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.488
Cardi B reposted it last night.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.424
You've racked up 11 reprimands
in one year.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.758
That has to be a record.

15:25.792 --> 15:26.994
Well, my parents taught me

15:27.027 --> 15:28.595
if you're gonna do something,
be the best.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.663
You sure you got the right
Mateo Chavez?

15:30.697 --> 15:33.600
You set AFD academy records
in multiple categories.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.168
Field stuff is easy.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.469
The field is where
you're tested.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.638
Except you have to pass
the written exams too,

15:38.671 --> 15:40.673
but I flunked out.

15:40.707 --> 15:41.941
Four times.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.276
When you wash out
that many times,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.245
why do you keep coming back?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.415
Because I was born
to do it, sir.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.917
Insubordination,
reckless behavior.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.652
I'm allergic
to poor leadership.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.122
Insubordination,
insubordination.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.124
When you were washing
your boss's car,

15:57.157 --> 15:58.925
you were wiping down the inside
of the door handles.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.093
Why?

16:00.127 --> 16:01.761
Nobody would ever know
if they're clean or not.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.796
I would, sir.

16:03.830 --> 16:04.931
Dad, you bring this guy in,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.499
people here would lose
their minds.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.834
Yep.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.602
*

16:09.636 --> 16:12.039
* I'm lonely

16:12.072 --> 16:13.973
* What do you think?

16:14.007 --> 16:16.343
* Can't think at all

16:16.376 --> 16:17.544
Gun!

16:17.577 --> 16:19.112
OWEN: How'd you know
he was the arsonist

16:19.146 --> 16:20.680
and he had a gun?

16:20.713 --> 16:21.714
Got lucky.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.116
OWEN: Yeah, lucky, my ass.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.852
You got a stack full
of Life Saving Commendations,

16:25.885 --> 16:28.221
which tells me you have a gift
for threat assessment.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.890
Would you say that has anything
to do with you being trans?

16:30.923 --> 16:32.559
Growing up the way I did,

16:32.592 --> 16:34.527
there was a lot of folks
who wanted to hurt me,

16:34.561 --> 16:36.663
so I guess I learned
to figure out who they were

16:36.696 --> 16:38.065
before they figured out
who I was.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.200
How would you feel
about relocating to Austin?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.834
Well, look, I'll be honest.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.336
The real reason I agreed
to come out here

16:43.370 --> 16:44.871
is 'cause I've always wanted
to check out

16:44.904 --> 16:47.006
South by Southwest.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.709
Thanks, Cap, but I transitioned
on the job in Chicago,

16:49.742 --> 16:51.010
and that was hard enough.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.912
I don't wanna imagine what
things are gonna be like

16:52.945 --> 16:54.181
down in Texas.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.748
Things have really
changed for me in Miami

16:55.782 --> 16:57.250
since that video went viral.

16:57.284 --> 17:00.087
For the first time,
I genuinely feel respected.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.888
Can you look me in the eye
and tell me

17:01.921 --> 17:04.324
that your department's
not using you as a prop?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.326
How do I know you're not
looking for a prop of your own

17:06.359 --> 17:08.595
to show everybody
how woke you are?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.230
My teachers all said
I was a little slow.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.232
I don't know what your teachers
told you in the past,

17:12.265 --> 17:13.833
but I know what you're not.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.735
You're not stupid.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.937
* Can't think at all

17:17.970 --> 17:19.906
-I'm not?
-No.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.076
You're thorough,

17:23.110 --> 17:25.578
you're relentless,

17:25.612 --> 17:29.015
and you're exactly the kind
of man I want in the 126.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.084
When I look at you
and what you've accomplished,

17:31.118 --> 17:33.120
I don't see a Muslim
or a woman.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.888
I see a kick-ass firefighter.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.626
You know, somewhere
in this town right now

17:39.659 --> 17:42.729
is a kid who is just like
you were.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.633
Feeling scared, helpless.

17:46.666 --> 17:50.770
I'd like you to show him,
or her, or they,

17:50.803 --> 17:53.773
it's okay to be who you are.

17:53.806 --> 17:57.076
And I'll double your salary.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.079
* You're one of my kind

18:00.113 --> 18:03.082
(solemn music)

18:03.116 --> 18:09.589
*

18:11.491 --> 18:14.127
You were there,
the night of the tragedy.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.131
Lone survivor.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.200
That's gotta be rough.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.737
It was six weeks
in the hospital, so.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.506
I'm good now.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.142
-Are you?
-Mm-hmm.

18:29.176 --> 18:32.512
'Cause it says here you haven't
completed your CSID.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.181
Ah, well, you know,

18:34.214 --> 18:36.449
I never really
had much use for talk.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.321
I'm sorry about your crew.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.022
They weren't just my crew.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.957
You know,
you should know that.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.759
They were my brothers, so--

18:46.793 --> 18:49.296
let's just--
let's just cut the--

18:49.329 --> 18:51.198
the fake-ass condolences, and--

18:51.231 --> 18:53.700
I don't even understand
why I had to come down here

18:53.733 --> 18:55.702
to interview for a job
that I've had

18:55.735 --> 18:58.205
since I graduated high school.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.672
You're not.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.674
This isn't an interview.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.843
I invited you down here
out of respect

19:03.876 --> 19:06.313
to tell you to your face
that I wasn't sure

19:06.346 --> 19:08.481
whether you'd be ready
to come back.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.651
Now, having talked to you,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.820
I am sure.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.655
You're not.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.891
-PTSD--
-PTSD my ass.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.027
I am the best firefighter
in Travis County.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.730
That may very well be,
but until--

19:23.763 --> 19:25.798
Hey, look, man, I saw what
you're doing when I came in.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.300
You got a whole, you know,

19:27.334 --> 19:29.068
"We are the world" thing
going, right?

19:29.101 --> 19:32.239
But you got no place
for a guy like me

19:32.272 --> 19:33.740
who can actually do the job.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.074
Mr. Ryder,
I'm gonna do you a favor.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.243
You gonna do me a favor?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.911
Who the hell do you think
you are?

19:38.945 --> 19:42.114
This is my house.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.185
It was.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.020
Yeah.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.223
I'm sorry.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.292
You're sorry.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.727
So how about this?

19:54.761 --> 19:56.696
How about you take
your "sorry,"

19:56.729 --> 19:59.232
and you stick it up your ass.

19:59.266 --> 20:02.235
(dramatic music)

20:02.269 --> 20:06.773
*

20:14.046 --> 20:16.082
REALTOR: There's a Jacuzzi tub
in the master

20:16.115 --> 20:18.618
and another bath downstairs.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.219
All the appliances are new.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.889
Kitchen was renovated
last year.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.892
Great backyard,
hill country views.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.460
Rent's 4,500.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.062
You're kidding.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.931
If that's a problem,
we can talk to the owners.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.566
No.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.601
It's not a problem.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.570
I'll give y'all a minute
to chat.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.375
I can rent this in Texas

20:42.409 --> 20:44.210
for less than a studio
apartment in Red Hook.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.313
Well, 'cause that Brooklyn
real estate is dumb.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.782
I mean, I think we kind of
have to do this.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.320
Isn't it a little much
for just one guy?

20:53.353 --> 20:54.421
What do you mean?

20:54.454 --> 20:56.088
I'm--

20:56.122 --> 20:58.991
I'm not living with my dad,
like, permanently.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.393
Am I?

21:00.427 --> 21:03.330
My only priority right now
is that you live.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.932
That means keeping you
under my roof.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.233
Remember our deal?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.835
You do what I say?

21:08.868 --> 21:11.270
By the way, don't you have
a meeting before your shift?

21:11.304 --> 21:13.773
All right.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.475
All right.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.614
I'm not leaving, Dustin,

21:21.648 --> 21:23.650
so you may as well
open the door.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.788
Fine, I'll just remind
the whole neighborhood

21:28.821 --> 21:32.291
that Dustin Shepard
is a murderer!

21:33.393 --> 21:35.628
You know you're not supposed
to be here.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.797
It's Iris' birthday.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.867
She's 28 today.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.103
You know what I thought
would make a great present?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.938
To give her a proper burial.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.608
I don't know what happened
to Iris.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.944
You can fool the damn cops,
but you cannot fool me!

21:51.978 --> 21:53.780
She spent the last night
of her life alive

21:53.813 --> 21:55.515
in this house.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.418
Tell me what you did
to my sister!

22:00.152 --> 22:02.021
You can hide all you want!

22:02.054 --> 22:05.057
You will never get rid of me!

22:05.091 --> 22:07.059
I'll be back!

22:07.093 --> 22:08.628
On Christmas,

22:08.661 --> 22:09.962
Easter,

22:09.996 --> 22:12.231
Earth Day!

22:12.264 --> 22:15.234
(dramatic music)

22:15.267 --> 22:18.405
*

22:18.438 --> 22:21.541
BOY: (wheezing)

22:21.574 --> 22:23.510
Hey.
You okay?

22:26.045 --> 22:27.514
Do you have an inhaler?

22:27.547 --> 22:28.581
No.

22:28.615 --> 22:29.882
But it's fine.
I'm okay.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.552
Until you're not.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.253
Mijo?

22:34.286 --> 22:35.722
Is there a problem?

22:35.755 --> 22:39.592
The problem is your son
has asthma and no medication.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.561
He needs an inhaler.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.929
We don't have insurance.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.832
Can't afford it.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.535
I volunteer with a group.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.937
Anything happens,
call this number.

22:50.970 --> 22:54.407
We help, no questions.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.577
(siren beeps)

22:57.610 --> 22:59.712
It's okay.
They're here for me.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.614
(siren beeps)

23:05.918 --> 23:07.587
Hey, Carlos.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.055
Hey, Michelle.

23:09.088 --> 23:15.928
*

23:17.129 --> 23:19.098
You can't keep doing this
to yourself.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.933
You've gotta get out
of this rut, chica.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.769
Happy to.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.805
Just find me a single damn lead
on my sister.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.406
CARLOS: You ever consider that
the reason

23:27.440 --> 23:29.275
we haven't found any evidence
of foul play

23:29.308 --> 23:31.143
is because there wasn't?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.815
Hey.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.416
Can you just drop me at work?

23:37.450 --> 23:39.586
My shift starts in 20 minutes.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.187
I'm not an Uber.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.924
I wasn't gonna tip.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.095
ANDY: Man, y'all sure do like
y'all peppers.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.763
MARCOS: Yeah,
so should you, bro.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.965
Texas Monthly says
it's the new super food now.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.802
Cranks up your metabolism,
boosts your immunity,

23:55.835 --> 23:57.303
natural aphrodisiac.

23:57.336 --> 23:58.938
Ah.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.773
And perfect ingredient
for revenge.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.308
So what, you gonna slip
a ghost pepper

24:02.341 --> 24:03.810
in Tony's taco or what?

24:03.843 --> 24:05.444
Hey.

24:05.478 --> 24:08.280
The man filled my shampoo
with hair remover.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.650
He deserves to be punished.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.953
ANDY: The hell is that?

24:13.986 --> 24:15.955
Look like the devil's nut sack.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.456
The holy grail is what it is.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.825
Carolina Reaper.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.527
2 million Scoville Heat Units.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.329
Hottest pepper on the planet.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.497
Hope you came hungry.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.465
-Yes.
-Always, cuz.

24:26.499 --> 24:27.834
Here we go.

24:27.867 --> 24:31.771
Yo, who is that?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.206
Her, in the blue.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.542
Oh, Maria.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.309
-Hygienist.
-Mm.

24:37.343 --> 24:39.011
She works with Tanya
at the office.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.279
Married.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.380
-Damn.
-Yeah.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.882
Hey, but if it makes you
feel any better,

24:42.915 --> 24:44.183
you never had a chance anyway.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.486
(both laugh)

24:52.491 --> 24:55.294
So?

24:55.327 --> 24:56.362
How is it?

24:56.395 --> 24:58.665
A little bland, to be honest.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.533
Real question is,

25:00.567 --> 25:01.734
how's yours?

25:04.103 --> 25:07.306
(laughs)

25:07.339 --> 25:09.742
30 years, you haven't grabbed
me a soda from the fridge.

25:09.776 --> 25:10.810
Now you're making me tacos?

25:10.843 --> 25:11.878
Come on, cuz.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.512
Try that, yeah.

25:13.546 --> 25:16.182
That's why you don't prank
the master, bitch!

25:16.215 --> 25:19.719
(groaning)

25:19.752 --> 25:21.420
Marcos!

25:21.453 --> 25:22.922
Marcos!

25:22.955 --> 25:25.391
Hey!

25:32.932 --> 25:35.401
TONY: My cousin's up here.
He's in bad shape.

25:35.434 --> 25:37.269
Just spit up some blood.
You gotta help him, please!

25:37.303 --> 25:38.705
OWEN: What's ETA on EMS?

25:38.738 --> 25:39.739
Supposedly on the way.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.873
All right, till they get here,

25:40.907 --> 25:41.774
you assess the patient.

25:41.808 --> 25:42.942
'Scuse us, 'scuse us,

25:42.975 --> 25:44.043
let us through.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.277
Marjan, talk to the family.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.445
See if he has any allergies.

25:46.478 --> 25:47.780
Mateo, move these people back

25:47.814 --> 25:49.381
so we have some room to work.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.417
MICHELLE: You mean give us
some room to work.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.451
This scene belongs to us.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.786
You must have missed the part

25:53.820 --> 25:55.755
where they made me
the captain of the 126.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.424
Michelle Blake,
Paramedic Captain.

25:58.457 --> 26:00.259
And this scene is medical,
so I run the call.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.094
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
since when does EMS

26:02.128 --> 26:03.529
tell Fire what time it is?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.264
You didn't read the
Travis County manual, did you?

26:05.297 --> 26:07.900
Uh, I'm more
of a visual learner.

26:07.934 --> 26:11.203
In Texas, EMS calls the shots
involving medical emergencies,

26:11.237 --> 26:13.773
so you do what I say, Captain.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.141
ROSEWATER:
Airway sounds blocked.

26:15.174 --> 26:18.110
Blood in the sputum,
esophageal spasms.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.812
You see his little
pepper garden?

26:19.846 --> 26:21.080
This is Boerhaave syndrome.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.414
Get me the suction tool,

26:22.448 --> 26:24.116
and a 1% solution
of Lidocaine-Epinephrine.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.618
Here?

26:25.652 --> 26:27.319
He's not gonna make it
to the hospital.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.622
I need your men to move him
onto the picnic table now.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.990
You heard the captain.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.292
He's got a ruptured esophagus.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.228
His chest cavity's filling
with fluid, drowning his lungs.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.097
I've gotta get the fluid out.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.435
(crowd groans)

26:45.604 --> 26:47.473
Suction.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.142
Come on, cuz.

26:50.176 --> 26:55.815
*

26:57.149 --> 26:59.118
Come on.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.488
*

27:02.521 --> 27:04.724
(groans)

27:05.958 --> 27:07.459
Thank God.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.342
Baby?
You home?

27:23.375 --> 27:24.543
Hey, babe.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.614
Hey.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.683
Cheat day come early this week?

27:30.717 --> 27:32.518
You know you want some.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.486
I do.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.190
So you went radio silent
on me today.

27:40.592 --> 27:41.660
How'd it go?

27:41.694 --> 27:44.396
The big talk
with Captain Strand.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.065
Oh.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.434
(clears throat)
It didn't.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.071
He says he don't think
I'm ready to come back,

27:52.104 --> 27:55.742
and he says that he's worried
that I got PTSD,

27:55.775 --> 27:59.611
which is just an excuse,
you know, 'cause I'm fine.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.615
Except for the nightmares,
Judd.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.553
Well, you know, fortunately,

28:07.586 --> 28:09.588
I only have to work
when I'm awake.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.060
Okay, so,

28:14.093 --> 28:16.095
you'll get another job
at a different station.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.164
I heard the 154 is looking.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.133
No, ma--no, I can't.
I'm--

28:22.101 --> 28:24.871
Look, if I walk away
from the 126,

28:24.904 --> 28:27.206
it's like I'm walking away
from them.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.410
So what are you gonna do?

28:31.443 --> 28:33.279
I don't know.

28:33.312 --> 28:37.449
(solemn music)

28:37.483 --> 28:39.786
Look, the captain's
got it in for me.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.754
He don't give a damn

28:41.788 --> 28:44.523
that I got 20 years
out on that rig.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.626
This job is everything to me.
That ain't fair.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.295
Well, sweetheart,
I hope you're not trying

28:49.328 --> 28:52.098
to tell a black woman
how tough life in Texas is.

28:53.632 --> 28:54.967
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.903
No, no.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.440
When you asked for my hand,
what did my father say to you?

29:03.475 --> 29:06.445
He, uh, well, he said
that he would die bloody

29:06.478 --> 29:08.447
before he let a redneck
from Seguin

29:08.480 --> 29:09.949
anywhere near his baby girl.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.784
And what did you do?

29:12.952 --> 29:16.789
I went back the next day
and I asked him again.

29:16.823 --> 29:17.990
And the day after that.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.959
-And the day after that.
-Mm-hmm

29:19.992 --> 29:22.728
Even built his pool deck,
as I recall.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.364
I ain't building Captain Strand
no pool deck.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.768
My point is, Judd,

29:29.802 --> 29:32.471
is the man I love has never
taken no for an answer.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.741
So do not start now.

29:35.774 --> 29:42.648
*

29:47.719 --> 29:49.588
Turn some lights on
in here now.

29:49.621 --> 29:56.528
*

29:58.865 --> 30:00.933
Mole check?

30:00.967 --> 30:02.869
Uh...

30:02.902 --> 30:04.603
Pimple check, actually.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.106
Pimples?
You get pimples?

30:07.139 --> 30:10.809
Yeah, some of the stuff
I have to take can cause acne.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.778
What's your routine?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.280
Your skincare regiment.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.214
Soap and water?

30:15.247 --> 30:16.615
Are you insane?

30:16.648 --> 30:18.217
That is the worst thing
you could do.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.185
Soap dries you out.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.287
-Isn't that a good thing?
-No.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.189
Single biggest mistake
all men make

30:23.222 --> 30:25.892
when it comes to skincare
is not washing properly,

30:25.925 --> 30:28.660
which is particularly
problematic for guys like us.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.162
You know, we work, we sweat,

30:30.196 --> 30:33.465
we break out,
so I start my routine

30:33.499 --> 30:35.467
with a gentle
exfoliating cleanser.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.905
It's all organic, and it has
detoxifying malachite.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.473
Uh, yeah, this looks
expensive, Cap.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.042
Oh.
Here, take this for now.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.211
It's got soothing botanicals.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.879
Guards against razor burn.
Open it.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.580
Huh?
Huh?

30:48.614 --> 30:50.883
A little cedar, a little
spruce, a little bergamot.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.584
They put wood in it?

30:52.618 --> 30:54.586
Finally,

30:54.620 --> 30:55.922
moisturizer.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.157
This is the engine.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.591
Keeps the whole thing moving.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.061
No, no, you can't have that.
This is very precious to me.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.698
I think I'm gonna stick
with soap and water.

31:06.732 --> 31:09.001
Hey, Cap?

31:09.035 --> 31:10.669
Thanks for this.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.339
You know, most people tend
to tiptoe around me.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.740
OWEN: You should expect
to be treated

31:14.773 --> 31:16.442
just like any other guy
around here.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.744
I have three commitments
to my people.

31:18.777 --> 31:21.413
Everybody who clocks in
will also clock out,

31:21.447 --> 31:23.349
everybody gets a fair shake,

31:23.382 --> 31:25.918
and no one, and I mean no one,

31:25.952 --> 31:28.354
gets left behind

31:28.387 --> 31:29.721
when it comes to skincare.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.423
(chuckles)

31:31.457 --> 31:33.392
Thanks, Cap.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.262
(bell ringing)

31:41.968 --> 31:43.970
(dramatic music)

31:47.139 --> 31:50.142
(sirens wailing)

31:52.945 --> 31:55.047
Captain Strand?
Officer Reyes, Austin PD.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.049
-Good to meet you, sir.
-Good to meet you.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.217
CARLOS: Single vehicle
accident.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.418
Looks like she hydroplaned,

31:59.451 --> 32:00.919
hit the light pole, and rolled
the vehicle.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.254
How many people inside?

32:02.288 --> 32:03.889
Just the driver,
Allison Parker.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.291
Doors are too smashed
to get her out,

32:05.324 --> 32:07.093
and don't look now,

32:07.126 --> 32:08.995
but you're about
to have an audience.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.967
Show 'em what we got.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.804
Allison, can you hear me?

32:18.837 --> 32:20.339
She's unconscious.
We gotta move.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.109
Hey, Cap.
We got gas in the water.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.676
The fuel tank must have busted.

32:24.710 --> 32:25.811
Everybody, get back!

32:25.844 --> 32:28.180
Mateo, disengage
that battery terminal.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.282
TK, get the CO2.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.651
Paul, I need you to get me
the Jaws of Life.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.286
On it.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.123
OWEN: Allison, hold on.
Stay with us.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.325
All right, team, let's get
this windshield off.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.459
(glass shatters)

32:40.492 --> 32:42.194
You watch yourself.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.396
Marjan, you're up.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.035
Looks like she's pregnant.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.269
I got a pulse.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.204
She's trapped under
the steering column.

32:52.238 --> 32:53.539
If we can't cut her
out of the car,

32:53.572 --> 32:55.541
we cut the car off of her.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.210
We gotta get her out.
I'm worried about this baby.

32:58.244 --> 33:04.483
*

33:04.516 --> 33:06.352
Cap.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.220
Allison, stay with us.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.489
TK: Hey, Dad, the EMTs
just pulled up.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.191
-Nice and easy now.
-You got her stable?

33:12.224 --> 33:15.394
Here we go.
(grunts)

33:15.427 --> 33:17.663
All right, guys, set her down.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.031
Scene's all yours, Captain.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.569
MICHELLE: Strong radial pulse.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.638
Ma'am?
Ma'am.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.174
My baby!

33:28.207 --> 33:29.708
My baby!
Is my baby okay?

33:29.741 --> 33:31.343
Listen, we're gonna get you
to the hospital

33:31.377 --> 33:33.512
so they can check on you
and your baby, okay?

33:33.545 --> 33:35.181
This baby and my other baby,
Henry.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.248
My 10-month old.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.550
He's in his car seat
in the back.

33:38.584 --> 33:42.188
*

33:42.221 --> 33:43.755
Marjan, what do you see
in there?

33:43.789 --> 33:46.092
There's baby seat attachments,
but no baby seat.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.593
All right!

33:47.626 --> 33:49.928
We're looking for a car seat
that probably got tossed

33:49.961 --> 33:51.430
when this thing rolled.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.432
We're gonna assume this child
is still alive.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.434
Why don't you guys start up
at that tree line.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.002
We're gonna look on this side
of the bank.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.571
We'll meet up in the middle.

33:59.605 --> 34:00.872
Where's Paul?

34:00.906 --> 34:03.041
PAUL: Hey, Cap, over here!

34:03.075 --> 34:06.545
The SUV was already rolling
when it struck the pole.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.414
She hydroplaned
into this guardrail

34:08.447 --> 34:10.249
and started rolling
from there.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.884
The doors must have flung open
with some force, because--

34:12.918 --> 34:15.354
(baby crying)

34:15.387 --> 34:18.090
Oh, my God.

34:18.124 --> 34:23.795
*

34:23.829 --> 34:26.298
Hey, Henry.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.266
Hang on.

34:27.299 --> 34:30.102
(baby screams)

34:30.136 --> 34:31.137
ALLISON: My baby!

34:31.170 --> 34:36.242
*

34:36.275 --> 34:39.044
(baby screaming)

34:39.077 --> 34:40.579
I see him.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.248
Trying to get to him.

34:42.281 --> 34:46.118
(branches snapping)

34:46.152 --> 34:50.156
*

34:50.189 --> 34:51.323
ALLISON: My baby!

34:51.357 --> 34:54.260
Henry!

34:54.293 --> 34:55.594
TK: Oh, no!
The baby!

34:55.627 --> 34:58.430
ALLISON: (screams)

34:58.464 --> 35:02.434
(baby crying)

35:02.468 --> 35:04.303
Whoo-hoo!

35:04.336 --> 35:05.804
Yeah, Cap!

35:05.837 --> 35:09.608
(all cheering)

35:09.641 --> 35:12.811
(baby crying)

35:12.844 --> 35:15.013
I think this belongs to you.

35:15.046 --> 35:17.283
Thank you!
Thank you!

35:18.850 --> 35:20.085
God bless y'all!

35:20.118 --> 35:21.820
All of y'all!

35:21.853 --> 35:28.794
*

35:36.001 --> 35:37.636
He's an impressive guy.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.038
He's my dad.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.817
Oh snap, it's already got,
like, 2 million views.

35:51.850 --> 35:52.818
Check this out.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.152
We're trending as
#TheDreamTeam.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.788
Okay, look, I've already
gone viral twice this month.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.224
At some point,
I'm gonna need an agent.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.558
No phones at the table.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.127
Here's to...

36:02.160 --> 36:04.896
to the future of the 126,

36:04.930 --> 36:07.132
and the memory of the old.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.835
(country music)

36:09.868 --> 36:11.937
How you doing?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.873
I'm okay.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.375
Really?

36:16.408 --> 36:18.810
Do I need to be worried
about you?

36:18.844 --> 36:21.547
No, I'm drinking mineral water.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.582
How'd your AA meeting go today?

36:25.116 --> 36:28.387
Apparently, they're way hipper
in Austin than in New York,

36:28.420 --> 36:32.924
so I actually really liked it.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.261
Thanks for bringing us
down here.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.363
I really like the crew,

36:37.396 --> 36:40.098
and I like that I get to start
something new with you.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.836
I think we're gonna be
just okay.

36:44.870 --> 36:51.710
*

36:51.743 --> 36:54.145
Look, TK.

36:55.481 --> 36:56.948
Dad?

36:58.750 --> 37:00.218
I just love you.

37:00.252 --> 37:06.292
*

37:07.826 --> 37:09.795
Ah.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.096
Aw, we should go.

37:11.129 --> 37:12.264
That's him?

37:12.298 --> 37:13.465
Okay.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.066
We ain't leaving.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.968
Judd, you would deny your
wife's one night to dance

37:17.002 --> 37:19.271
because he's here?

37:19.305 --> 37:21.072
No, sir.
Come on.

37:21.106 --> 37:22.374
Let's get some drinks.

37:22.408 --> 37:23.809
EMCEE: All right, y'all.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.912
Now who's ready for some
good old Texas line dancing?

37:26.945 --> 37:29.915
(Brooks & Dunn
"Boot Scootin' Boogie")

37:29.948 --> 37:32.150
Captain Strand, shall we?

37:32.183 --> 37:33.585
Oh, no, no.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.253
You do not want to see me
line dance.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.289
Oh, are you shy?

37:37.323 --> 37:39.257
I thought you weren't scared
of anything.

37:39.291 --> 37:42.428
Ah, now I see why
you invited us all here.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.929
I see you.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.263
Trying to exert your dominance?

37:45.297 --> 37:48.834
Well, I just think a man
should have to earn his spurs.

37:48.867 --> 37:54.906
*

37:54.940 --> 37:57.476
(all cheering)

37:57.509 --> 38:02.914
*

38:02.948 --> 38:05.484
* Out in the country
past the city limits sign *

38:05.517 --> 38:07.619
* Well there's a honky-tonk

38:07.653 --> 38:09.488
* Near the county line

38:09.521 --> 38:13.625
I thought you said I didn't
want to see you line dance.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.193
I didn't want to show you up.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.431
* They got whiskey, women

38:19.465 --> 38:20.766
* Music and smoke

38:20.799 --> 38:23.535
* It's where
all the cowboy folk *

38:23.569 --> 38:27.606
* Go to boot scooting boogie

38:27.639 --> 38:29.040
Hey.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.510
Hey.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.812
* When it's quitting time

38:33.845 --> 38:35.614
Do you wanna dance?

38:35.647 --> 38:38.016
* I fire up my pickup truck

38:38.049 --> 38:40.218
Yeah.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.721
*

38:42.754 --> 38:45.156
* I go flying
down that highway *

38:45.190 --> 38:47.058
* To that hideaway

38:47.092 --> 38:49.495
* Stuck out in the woods

38:49.528 --> 38:53.031
* To do the boot scooting
boogie *

38:53.064 --> 38:54.199
* Yeah

38:54.232 --> 38:55.567
* Heel, toe, do-si-do

38:55.601 --> 38:57.836
Where'd you learn how to dance
like that?

38:57.869 --> 39:00.171
Ah, the whole cowboy thing
was huge

39:00.205 --> 39:01.373
in the city in the '90s.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.174
There was a bar called
Hogs and Heifers.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.076
We'd line dance every Thursday.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.013
Guess I never lost my step.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.682
* Oh get down, turn around

39:10.716 --> 39:13.385
* Go to town,
boot scooting boogie *

39:13.419 --> 39:17.923
*

39:17.956 --> 39:20.959
(coughing)

39:27.433 --> 39:30.402
Excuse me, Captain Strand.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.937
Sorry, I'm Grace Ryder.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.572
Judd Ryder's my husband.

39:33.605 --> 39:34.706
Oh.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.941
Owen Strand.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.877
We've actually met, Captain,
over the radio.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.912
I work 9-1-1 dispatch.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.113
I took the call that night.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.749
I was on the line
with my husband

39:43.782 --> 39:44.916
when the explosion happened.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.253
He was running back towards
the danger.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.388
Yeah, I read the report.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.723
And his Commendation.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.759
And I read yours.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.394
It was all online.

39:56.428 --> 39:57.829
You and Judd are a lot alike.

39:59.631 --> 40:02.501
You know that saving people
is like oxygen to him.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.137
And he's suffocating.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.607
Yeah, well, he needs
to take a little time

40:08.640 --> 40:09.775
to take care of himself

40:09.808 --> 40:11.943
before he can take care
of anybody else.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.111
I'm not asking you to throw him

40:13.144 --> 40:14.646
back into the action
right away, Captain.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.147
I know he's not ready for that.

40:16.181 --> 40:18.149
So what are you asking me?

40:19.117 --> 40:20.318
What I'm asking is that

40:20.351 --> 40:22.020
you do what you do best.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.091
I'm asking you to save him.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.493
Please.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.098
Have him come to the station
tomorrow.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.967
Let's see if there's
something I can do.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.636
Okay.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.337
Thank you, Captain.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.609
Oh, and welcome to Austin.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.612
(emotional music)

40:46.645 --> 40:49.848
*

40:57.823 --> 41:00.125
OWEN: I have to say, I was
surprised meeting your wife.

41:01.359 --> 41:03.328
'Cause she's black?

41:03.361 --> 41:05.096
Because she's wise.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.666
She's a smart lady.
You married up.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.668
So did I, the first time.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.603
With TK's mom.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.139
The second time was--

41:14.172 --> 41:16.942
ah, anyway, never mind.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.044
Grace thought I should, uh...

41:20.979 --> 41:23.314
come in here and apologize
to you.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.051
Said maybe you'd give me
my old job back.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.686
There you go.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.454
Wise.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.058
But my old job
don't exist anymore

41:33.091 --> 41:36.862
'cause when you trashed them,
you trashed it.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.496
What?

41:38.530 --> 41:40.331
Well, when you threw them out,

41:40.365 --> 41:42.467
when you threw out
every picture and every card,

41:42.500 --> 41:45.170
every memory of those men,

41:45.203 --> 41:47.673
those incredible men,

41:47.706 --> 41:49.374
you just--you trashed it all.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.176
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.344
Nobody trashed anybody.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.180
Did I drag this place
kicking and screaming

41:55.213 --> 41:56.514
into the 21st century?

41:56.548 --> 41:57.916
Yes.

41:57.949 --> 42:01.219
Because I know
that after a tragedy,

42:01.252 --> 42:02.520
people need a fresh start.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.890
Oh, I get it.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.325
You're a real American hero.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.995
We should all just bend down
and kiss your Gucci loafers

42:10.028 --> 42:11.563
because your men died

42:11.597 --> 42:13.832
in an attack in New York City

42:13.865 --> 42:16.067
with the whole world watching,

42:16.101 --> 42:18.670
and my boys bit it

42:18.704 --> 42:22.073
in a stupid manure fire
in Texas.

42:22.107 --> 42:23.441
Yeah.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.411
(dramatic music)

42:26.444 --> 42:31.249
*

42:31.282 --> 42:32.951
I have cancer.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.322
I've never said that
out loud before.

42:38.757 --> 42:41.927
Only three people
on the planet know.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.763
My doctor, me, and now you.

42:44.796 --> 42:47.766
So,

42:47.799 --> 42:49.935
at some point I'll
have to face this diagnosis,

42:49.968 --> 42:52.137
just like you have to face
what you've lost.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.777
I barely got the lid
on this thing, Cap.

43:00.779 --> 43:02.981
If I take it off,

43:03.014 --> 43:06.718
I don't know if I can get
the monster back in his cage.

43:06.752 --> 43:09.054
I'm sorry for what I said.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.421
I'm sorry for everything,

43:10.455 --> 43:12.624
and I appreciate you
trying to help me out, but...

43:15.126 --> 43:16.862
This ain't never gonna
work out.

43:19.631 --> 43:20.799
Thank you.

43:20.832 --> 43:27.773
*

43:34.145 --> 43:36.181
MAN: Hey!

43:36.214 --> 43:38.483
MAN: Help me!

43:38.516 --> 43:42.988
*

43:43.021 --> 43:45.924
Aw, man!

43:45.957 --> 43:48.326
(sobbing)
Oh, no!

43:51.529 --> 43:52.931
All right.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.266
Chavez, Strickland, why don't
you get dinner started?

43:55.300 --> 43:57.669
Nothing that comes
out of a box.

43:57.703 --> 44:01.773
(sobbing)

44:01.807 --> 44:03.641
Oh, man.

44:03.675 --> 44:05.510
It's the first thing I did

44:05.543 --> 44:07.545
when I redid the station
in Manhattan.

44:07.578 --> 44:08.714
Put up one of those.

44:10.682 --> 44:12.884
So we could see their faces

44:12.918 --> 44:16.321
every time we went out
on a call.

44:18.489 --> 44:22.493
To ensure that we honored
their memory.

44:24.329 --> 44:25.997
OWEN: Their sacrifice.

44:27.365 --> 44:28.900
Your men,

44:28.934 --> 44:31.669
your brothers,

44:31.703 --> 44:34.773
they'll never be forgotten.

44:38.676 --> 44:41.713
And they call it PTSD,
but they should call it

44:41.747 --> 44:43.514
PTSI,

44:43.548 --> 44:45.050
'cause that's what it is.

44:45.083 --> 44:47.285
It's not a disorder,
you've been injured.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.758
The monster's coming out
either way, Judd.

44:54.893 --> 44:57.095
Believe me.

44:57.128 --> 44:58.596
COLLEEN: (clears throat)

44:58.629 --> 45:01.399
Sorry, is this a bad time?

45:01.432 --> 45:02.700
Hey, Judd.

45:02.734 --> 45:04.836
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.404
-Hey.
-Hey, how are you?

45:06.437 --> 45:07.605
Hi.

45:07.638 --> 45:09.875
Hey, hey, sweetheart.

45:09.908 --> 45:12.377
Owen, this is Colleen,

45:12.410 --> 45:14.679
and this is Mable.

45:14.712 --> 45:18.083
This was Chuck Parkland's wife
and daughter.

45:18.116 --> 45:21.352
Oh, it is an absolute honor.

45:21.386 --> 45:22.754
We saw you save a baby
on the news,

45:22.788 --> 45:25.090
so we brought y'all cookies.

45:25.123 --> 45:27.425
Oh, thank you so much,

45:27.458 --> 45:28.593
but you see, I'm keto.

45:28.626 --> 45:30.028
Ah, no, no, he's not.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.262
No, no, no, no,
he's gonna eat it,

45:31.296 --> 45:32.630
and he's gonna love it,
ain't you?

45:32.663 --> 45:34.432
Mmm.

45:34.465 --> 45:36.101
This is the best cookie
I've ever had.

45:36.134 --> 45:39.104
The secret is Daddy's lard.

45:39.137 --> 45:41.272
It's Premium Parkland Lard.

45:41.306 --> 45:43.274
It's been passed down
generation to generation.

45:43.308 --> 45:44.742
Chef's father gave it to him,

45:44.776 --> 45:47.445
and now it is Mable's turn
to cook with it.

45:47.478 --> 45:48.780
Well, that is a--

45:48.814 --> 45:50.949
an unbelievable
family heirloom.

45:50.982 --> 45:53.551
Chef always said anybody
in the 126,

45:53.584 --> 45:56.254
same as blood to us.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.389
So, we just wanted to say,

45:58.423 --> 46:01.426
welcome to the family,
Captain Strand.

46:01.459 --> 46:02.593
Well, thank you.

46:02.627 --> 46:05.630
That means everything.

46:05.663 --> 46:07.632
Well, we'll let y'all
get back to work.

46:07.665 --> 46:09.600
(chuckles)

46:09.634 --> 46:10.936
It's good seeing y'all.

46:10.969 --> 46:13.939
Oh, and I love what you've done
with the place.

46:13.972 --> 46:17.275
My Lord, it was so depressing.

46:17.308 --> 46:18.743
Right?

46:18.776 --> 46:21.746
