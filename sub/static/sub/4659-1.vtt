02:26.581 --> 02:28.280
Harry, answer that.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.481
So, what do you want to hack for, Bickle?
I can't sleep nights.

02:35.581 --> 02:39.281
- There's porno theaters for that.
- I know. I tried that.

02:43.981 --> 02:45.879
So what do you do now?

02:46.480 --> 02:49.780
Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.879
Figured if I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

02:52.979 --> 02:55.479
Wanna work uptown nights,
South Bronx, Harlem?

02:55.479 --> 03:00.779
- I'll work anytime, anywhere.
- Will you work Jewish holidays?
Anytime, anywhere.

03:00.779 --> 03:03.379
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

03:05.079 --> 03:07.378
<i>- Give me one cab.
- How's your driving record?</i>

03:07.479 --> 03:10.578
It's clean, real clean, like my conscience.

03:10.678 --> 03:14.779
Are you gonna break my chops?
Got trouble with guys like you
breaking my chops.

03:14.879 --> 03:18.579
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches. Understand?

03:18.679 --> 03:20.978
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.

03:22.777 --> 03:24.577
- Physical?
- Clean.

03:24.577 --> 03:26.377
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

03:26.677 --> 03:27.977
Education?

03:28.677 --> 03:29.777
Some.

03:31.077 --> 03:34.377
<i>Here, there, you know.
Hey, Horowitz!</i>

03:35.977 --> 03:37.577
Military record?

03:37.777 --> 03:39.677
Honorable discharge...

03:40.277 --> 03:42.076
May 1973.

03:42.676 --> 03:45.176
- Were you in the army?
- Marines.

03:46.877 --> 03:48.976
I was in the Marines, too.

03:51.576 --> 03:54.677
So what is it? You need an extra job?

03:56.276 --> 03:58.475
Are you moonlighting?

03:59.575 --> 04:03.275
I just want to work long hours.
What's moonlighting?

04:03.975 --> 04:08.775
Look, just fill out these forms and
check back tomorrow when the shift breaks.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.274
<i>O'Brien, please step up.</i>

04:11.374 --> 04:15.675
Take the car out to 58th Street, please,
'cause it's crowded on 57th.

04:25.674 --> 04:28.574
All right, I'm coming down there.

04:28.574 --> 04:30.074
Let's go.

05:11.371 --> 05:12.871
<i>May 10.</i>

05:13.371 --> 05:15.771
<i>Thank God for the rain
which has helped wash away...</i>

05:15.871 --> 05:18.970
<i>the garbage and trash off the sidewalks.</i>

05:20.071 --> 05:22.070
<i>I'm working long hours now.</i>

05:22.170 --> 05:24.271
<i>6:00 in the afternoon
to 6:00 in the morning...</i>

05:24.371 --> 05:26.171
<i>sometimes even 8:00 in the morning.</i>

05:26.171 --> 05:29.070
<i>Six days a week,
sometimes seven days a week.</i>

05:29.470 --> 05:32.470
<i>It's a long hustle, but it keeps me real busy.</i>

05:32.470 --> 05:35.070
<i>I can take in $300, $350 a week...</i>

05:35.070 --> 05:38.870
<i>sometimes even more
when I do it off the meter.</i>

06:02.469 --> 06:05.269
<i>All the animals come out at night.</i>

06:05.769 --> 06:10.468
<i>Whores, skunk pussies, buggers,
queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.</i>

06:11.968 --> 06:13.668
<i>Sick, venal.</i>

06:16.768 --> 06:21.368
<i>Someday a real rain'll come
and wash this scum off the streets.</i>

06:28.467 --> 06:33.066
<i>I go all over. I take people to the Bronx,
Brooklyn, I take them to Harlem.</i>

06:33.166 --> 06:36.766
<i>I don't care. Don't make no difference to me.</i>

06:36.866 --> 06:40.166
<i>It does to some.
Some won't even take spooks.</i>

06:40.166 --> 06:43.866
<i>Don't make no difference to me.
Driver, 48th and 6th please.</i>

06:43.866 --> 06:47.266
Man, you're a gorgeous, brown,
beautiful little girl.

06:50.766 --> 06:55.566
- I can't afford to get stopped anywhere.
- No, we wouldn't want that to happen.

06:55.866 --> 07:01.164
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
if you do the right things.
You got a way.

07:03.865 --> 07:05.865
Yeah, now you're talking.

07:07.164 --> 07:09.265
Driver, hurry up, will you?

07:10.065 --> 07:12.064
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

07:47.062 --> 07:49.362
<i>Each night when I return the cab
to the garage...</i>

07:49.462 --> 07:52.762
<i>I have to clean the come off the back seat.</i>

07:56.762 --> 07:59.562
<i>Some nights I clean out the blood.</i>

08:32.760 --> 08:34.259
Can I help you?

08:34.259 --> 08:36.159
Yeah, what's your name?

08:36.460 --> 08:40.259
- My name is Travis.
- That's nice. What can I do for you?

08:42.059 --> 08:45.460
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

08:46.160 --> 08:51.358
Give me a break.
You can tell me what your name is.
I'm not gonna do anything.

08:51.658 --> 08:55.258
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to, I'm just asking...

08:55.358 --> 08:57.658
- Troy!
- All right, okay.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.957
Can I have a chuckles there?

09:05.158 --> 09:08.958
You have any jujubes? They last longer.
I'd like to get some.

09:09.057 --> 09:11.358
What you see is what we got.

09:19.857 --> 09:21.658
I'll take these.

09:24.057 --> 09:25.457
Coca-Cola.

09:25.557 --> 09:29.156
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

09:30.856 --> 09:32.856
$1.85.

09:55.055 --> 09:58.455
<i>Twelve hours of work, and I still can't sleep.</i>

09:59.155 --> 10:00.555
<i>Damn!</i>

10:00.755 --> 10:02.955
<i>The days go on and on.</i>

10:03.655 --> 10:05.554
<i>They don't end.</i>

10:06.254 --> 10:09.454
<i>All my life needed
was a sense of some place to go.</i>

10:09.654 --> 10:14.454
<i>I don't believe that one should devote
his life to morbid self-attention.</i>

10:14.554 --> 10:19.254
<i>I believe that someone should become
a person like other people.</i>

10:20.553 --> 10:25.654
<i>I first saw her at Palantine Campaign
Headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.</i>

10:26.253 --> 10:28.854
<i>She was wearing a white dress.</i>

10:29.253 --> 10:31.753
<i>She appeared like an angel.</i>

10:31.753 --> 10:34.353
<i>Out of this filthy mess...</i>

10:34.953 --> 10:36.753
<i>she is alone.</i>

10:38.253 --> 10:41.052
<i>They cannot...</i>

10:41.952 --> 10:44.852
<i>touch her.</i>

10:56.952 --> 10:58.651
Yes, well...

10:58.751 --> 11:03.051
you delivered two boxes.
I think it's a total of 5,000 campaign buttons.

11:03.051 --> 11:07.751
Now, on all the ones we had before,
our slogan is "We are the people"...

11:08.051 --> 11:12.051
and "are" is underlined.
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

11:12.251 --> 11:14.550
That reads "We are the people."

11:15.351 --> 11:17.051
Well, I think there's a difference.

11:17.151 --> 11:20.849
"We are the people" is not the same as
"We are the people."

11:21.249 --> 11:22.850
Let's not fight.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.350
Look, we'll make it real simple.

11:26.350 --> 11:31.049
We don't pay for the buttons.
We throw the buttons away, all right?

11:31.249 --> 11:32.950
Come here a minute.

11:34.649 --> 11:35.849
What?

11:43.649 --> 11:48.049
This canvas report is ready. If Andy okays it,
send copies to headquarters...

11:48.149 --> 11:51.249
I got to get that New York Times
article Xeroxed. That has to be...

11:51.349 --> 11:53.849
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget. Look...

11:53.948 --> 11:56.547
We have to emphasize
the Mandatory Welfare Program.

11:56.647 --> 12:00.247
- That's the issue that should be pushed.
- First push the man, then the issue.

12:00.347 --> 12:05.048
Sen. Palantine is a dynamic man.
An intelligent, interesting, fresh...

12:05.248 --> 12:08.348
- You forgot sexy.
- I did not forget sexy.

12:08.448 --> 12:11.347
Listen to yourself.
You sound like you're selling mouthwash.

12:11.448 --> 12:15.247
- We are selling mouthwash.
- Are we authorized to do that?
Very funny.

12:15.347 --> 12:18.647
We can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

12:18.747 --> 12:21.247
My uncle's in jail because of that.

12:21.546 --> 12:25.747
It's not really jail.
Living with his wife, anything would be jail.

12:25.847 --> 12:28.246
- Look over there.
- I love you.

12:28.446 --> 12:30.646
- Notice anything?
- No.

12:30.746 --> 12:33.746
- Put your glasses on.
- Okay. Just a minute.

12:34.046 --> 12:37.445
- All right.
- That taxi driver's been staring at us.

12:46.745 --> 12:50.344
- What taxi driver?
- That one. The one that's sitting there.

12:50.444 --> 12:54.445
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know, but it feels like a long time.

12:54.545 --> 12:56.644
- Does he bother you?
- No.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.345
You really mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

12:59.345 --> 13:02.645
- You're quick. You're really quick.
- I try to be real quick.

13:02.745 --> 13:05.345
Tell you what.
I'll play the male in this relationship.

13:05.445 --> 13:08.944
- I'll go out...
- Good luck.
And tell him to move.

13:08.944 --> 13:13.743
- And I don't need good luck. Thank you.
- Yes, you do. You just think you don't.

13:21.543 --> 13:25.742
You're blocking our doorway.
You think you might wanna move the cab?

15:06.337 --> 15:08.936
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

15:09.337 --> 15:13.337
lipstick, rouge.
Not rouge. "Blush-on" they call it.

15:14.437 --> 15:17.637
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah. It's blush-on.

15:20.437 --> 15:22.436
- Travis!
- Wiz.

15:22.536 --> 15:25.036
That's blush-on. My wife uses it.

15:25.736 --> 15:28.036
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

15:28.736 --> 15:33.236
A cup of coffee, please.
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it, you know.

15:33.336 --> 15:35.535
Then perfume, the spray kind.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.435
Get this.
In the middle of the Triborough bridge...

15:38.535 --> 15:41.735
and this woman is beautiful,
she changes her pantyhose.

15:41.835 --> 15:43.434
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

15:43.434 --> 15:46.634
- What did you do?
- I threw the meter, you know.

15:47.034 --> 15:51.434
I jump in the backseat, whip it out,
and I say, "You know what this is?"

15:51.935 --> 15:56.135
She says, "It's love." I'm gonna
fuck her brains out. She goes wild.

15:56.135 --> 15:59.335
And she said, "It's the greatest
single experience of my life."

15:59.335 --> 16:03.134
She gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

16:04.134 --> 16:06.834
Travis, you know Doughboy, Charlie T?

16:08.134 --> 16:10.733
Hey, Travis, got change for a nickel?

16:10.833 --> 16:14.433
We call him Doughboy
'cause he'll do anything for a buck.

16:15.732 --> 16:17.633
So, how's it hanging?

16:21.733 --> 16:23.132
What's that?

16:26.832 --> 16:30.432
I just heard on the radio some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

16:30.432 --> 16:34.132
- Stickup?
- No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.

16:34.232 --> 16:38.432
- Cut half his ear off.
- Where?
They said 122nd Street.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.432
Fucking Mau Mau land.

16:45.332 --> 16:47.730
You run all over town, don't you?

16:49.431 --> 16:50.730
Travis?

16:57.530 --> 17:00.131
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

17:00.231 --> 17:04.730
I mean,
you handled some pretty rough customers.
Yeah, I have.

17:05.130 --> 17:08.130
- You carry a piece?
- No.

17:08.230 --> 17:10.029
- You need one?
- No.

17:10.630 --> 17:14.130
If you ever need one, I know a fellow
who can get you a real nice deal.

17:14.230 --> 17:16.030
Lots of shit around.

17:16.130 --> 17:18.630
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

17:19.929 --> 17:23.029
But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.

17:33.628 --> 17:35.628
I'm gonna go do my dirt.

17:37.328 --> 17:38.428
Travis.

17:40.228 --> 17:41.528
Look.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.928
A piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

17:45.427 --> 17:47.128
Dig the symbols.

17:47.228 --> 17:50.828
"F-4-0-5-4-3-4"

17:52.227 --> 17:53.728
The watermark.

17:54.128 --> 17:55.827
There's one person.

17:56.127 --> 17:59.627
There's two persons,
and there's three persons.

17:59.727 --> 18:02.026
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

18:02.126 --> 18:06.226
Why don't you take it? If you can sell it,
you give me half of what you got.

18:06.626 --> 18:08.226
I don't want it.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.326
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.626
- I'm terribly sorry.
- What now?

18:29.726 --> 18:32.526
- Nothing!
- That's very cute. Thank you.

18:32.826 --> 18:35.125
Hey, you want to see something?

18:35.526 --> 18:38.724
Wait. I just typed,
"You want to see something?"

18:40.124 --> 18:42.124
- What?
- lf you had...

18:42.524 --> 18:47.224
these three fingers missing on this hand
and that hand missing on that hand...

18:47.524 --> 18:52.623
how would you light a match?
- I wouldn't light a match.
- Go ahead, give it a try.

18:54.624 --> 18:58.124
Well, I don't think I could do it.
No?

18:58.524 --> 19:01.524
It's gonna be difficult. I'll give it a try.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.023
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

19:14.322 --> 19:16.222
Just a minute.

19:23.522 --> 19:25.021
I can't do it.

19:25.422 --> 19:29.622
- The guy at the newsstand can do it.
- I don't work at a newsstand.

19:30.722 --> 19:32.622
- He's probably Italian.
- No.

19:32.722 --> 19:34.421
- You sure he's not Italian?
- He's black.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.822
If he had been Italian,
he might have been a thief.

19:36.922 --> 19:39.221
They do that.
The mob does that a lot of times.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.121
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

19:42.221 --> 19:44.921
I'll tell you something else.
It's like a joke, but true.

19:45.021 --> 19:48.021
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.520
- Apparently it's symbolic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

19:51.620 --> 19:54.420
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.720
You got to catch a pigeon.
A canary, you can walk into a pet store.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.120
As long as you pay for it, boom.

19:59.220 --> 20:03.119
Kill it right there. Put it on anyone you want.
Doesn't matter.

20:28.118 --> 20:32.017
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you over here.

20:32.117 --> 20:35.217
I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind.

20:38.318 --> 20:41.018
Why do you feel that
you have to volunteer to me?

20:41.118 --> 20:45.117
Because I think you are
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

20:47.418 --> 20:50.718
Thanks. But what do you think of Palantine?

20:56.617 --> 21:00.916
Charles Palantine, the man you're
volunteering to help elect President.

21:01.617 --> 21:04.916
I'm sure he'll make a good president.
I don't know his policies...

21:05.016 --> 21:07.515
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

21:08.516 --> 21:11.215
- You want to canvass?
- I'll canvass.

21:11.315 --> 21:13.915
How do you feel about
the Senator's stand on welfare?

21:14.015 --> 21:18.615
I don't know the Senator's stand on welfare,
but I'm sure it's a good stand.

21:18.615 --> 21:21.215
- Are you sure of that?
- Yeah.

21:24.415 --> 21:26.815
We all work together here full-time,
day and night.

21:26.815 --> 21:30.215
If you would step over there,
I'm sure the gentleman will sign you up.

21:30.315 --> 21:33.715
I drive a taxi at night, so it's hard for me...

21:34.415 --> 21:36.114
to work in the day.

21:38.215 --> 21:43.213
Then what exactly do you want?
Would you like to come
have some coffee and pie with me?

21:43.213 --> 21:44.714
Why?

21:44.714 --> 21:47.313
Why? I'll tell you why.

21:48.414 --> 21:50.713
I think you're a lonely person.

21:50.713 --> 21:54.814
I drive by this place a lot,
and I see you here.
I see a lot of people around you...

21:54.914 --> 21:59.613
and I see all these phones
and stuff on your desk.
That means nothing.

22:00.313 --> 22:05.513
Then I came inside and met you...
I saw in your eyes,
I saw the way you carried yourself...

22:05.513 --> 22:07.913
that you're not a happy person.

22:08.412 --> 22:13.513
I think you need something.
If you want to call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

22:14.013 --> 22:16.912
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.112
What do you say?

22:31.011 --> 22:34.511
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

22:39.111 --> 22:42.811
Five minutes. That's all.
Just outside, right around here.

22:42.811 --> 22:44.811
I'm there to protect you.

22:50.610 --> 22:53.109
Come on. Just take a little break.

22:55.910 --> 23:00.309
I have a break at 4:00, and if you're here...
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

23:00.809 --> 23:03.409
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

23:03.909 --> 23:06.709
- All right. 4:00 p. m?
- Right.

23:07.309 --> 23:12.608
- Outside, in the front?
- Yes.
Okay. My name is Travis. Betsy?

23:13.909 --> 23:15.508
- Travis.
- Yeah.

23:16.309 --> 23:18.409
I appreciate this, Betsy.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.607
<i>May 26, 4:00 p.m.</i>

23:35.707 --> 23:39.907
<i>I took Betsy to Child's Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.</i>

23:40.507 --> 23:44.706
<i>I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.</i>

23:45.307 --> 23:47.706
<i>I think that was a good selection.</i>

23:47.806 --> 23:52.207
<i>Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.
But she could've had anything she wanted.</i>

23:52.507 --> 23:58.506
15,000 volunteers in New York alone
is not bad...
but, Christ, the organizational problems.

23:59.307 --> 24:02.406
I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

24:02.406 --> 24:07.105
I got to get organized.
You know, little things
like my apartment, my possessions.

24:08.305 --> 24:12.405
I should get a sign saying,
"One of these days I'll get organezized."

24:12.405 --> 24:15.605
- You mean organized?
- "Organeziezd."

24:16.404 --> 24:18.705
Organeziezd. It's a joke.

24:19.704 --> 24:22.505
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

24:22.605 --> 24:27.104
You mean organezized
like those office signs that say "thimk."

24:33.004 --> 24:35.505
Do you like the place you work in?

24:35.804 --> 24:40.604
We've got some good people
working for us...
and I think Palantine's got a good chance.

24:43.803 --> 24:46.303
You know, you have beautiful eyes.

24:52.603 --> 24:55.802
- Do you like the guy you work with?
- He's okay.

24:58.402 --> 25:00.503
Yeah, but do you like him?

25:00.503 --> 25:03.203
He's funny, and he's very good at his job.
He's okay.

25:03.303 --> 25:08.102
- Though he does have a few problems.
- I would say he has quite a few problems.

25:08.902 --> 25:11.802
His energy seems to go in the wrong places.

25:12.502 --> 25:15.202
When I walked in
and saw you two sitting there...

25:15.302 --> 25:19.901
I could tell by the way you both related
there was no connection whatsoever.

25:20.101 --> 25:23.601
And I felt when I walked in
that there was something between us.

25:23.700 --> 25:26.601
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

25:26.601 --> 25:29.201
So that gave me the right
to come in and talk to you.

25:29.301 --> 25:32.501
Otherwise, I never would have felt
I had the right to talk to you...

25:32.601 --> 25:36.600
or say anything to you.
I never would have had the courage
to talk to you.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.000
With him, I felt there was nothing,
and I could sense it.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.900
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

25:46.700 --> 25:49.000
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

25:51.400 --> 25:54.400
- Where are you from?
- Upstate.

25:58.099 --> 26:00.499
That fellow you work with, I don't like him.

26:00.599 --> 26:03.899
Not that I don't like him.
I just think he's silly.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.999
I don't think he respects you.

26:09.098 --> 26:12.498
I don't believe I've ever met anyone
quite like you.

26:23.398 --> 26:27.298
You wanna go to a movie with me?

26:28.698 --> 26:32.797
- I have to go back to work.
- I don't mean now. Like another time?

26:39.197 --> 26:41.796
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

26:42.597 --> 26:44.996
- What?
- That song.

26:46.297 --> 26:49.596
By Kris Kristofferson.

26:52.096 --> 26:54.596
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

26:55.096 --> 26:58.496
He's a prophet and a pusher.

26:58.796 --> 27:02.696
Partly truth, partly fiction.
A walking contradiction.

27:04.596 --> 27:08.296
- You saying that about me?
- Who else would I be talking about?

27:08.396 --> 27:10.894
I'm no pusher. I never have pushed.

27:11.695 --> 27:15.495
No, just the part about the contradictions.
You are that.

27:46.492 --> 27:48.892
<i>I called Betsy again at her office,
and she said...</i>

27:48.892 --> 27:52.492
<i>maybe we'd go to a movie
after she gets off work tomorrow.</i>

27:52.592 --> 27:55.092
<i>That's my day off. At first she hesitated.</i>

27:55.192 --> 27:58.492
<i>But I called her again and then she agreed.</i>

27:59.492 --> 28:04.191
<i>Betsy. No, Betsy what?
I forgot to ask her last name again.</i>

28:04.292 --> 28:07.491
<i>Damn. I got to remember stuff like that.</i>

28:18.692 --> 28:20.391
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

28:20.491 --> 28:22.191
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

28:22.291 --> 28:24.590
until things start coming in from California.

28:24.690 --> 28:27.890
This is just making me nervous.
We should have waited for the limo.

28:27.990 --> 28:31.990
I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind going
to California without preparing right.

28:32.090 --> 28:36.690
- That's gonna get us in trouble.
- Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?

28:37.490 --> 28:38.790
Yes, I am.

28:40.490 --> 28:42.390
I'm one of your biggest supporters.

28:42.390 --> 28:48.090
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
that they have to vote for you.
Why, thank you...

28:49.389 --> 28:50.489
Travis.

28:50.489 --> 28:53.889
I'm sure you're gonna win, sir.
Everybody I know is gonna vote for you.

28:53.989 --> 28:56.589
In fact, I was gonna put one
of your stickers in my taxi.

28:56.589 --> 29:00.288
But the company said it was against
their policy, they don't know anything.

29:00.388 --> 29:02.888
- They're a bunch of jerks.
- Let me tell you something...

29:02.988 --> 29:05.988
I have learned more about America
from riding in taxi cabs...

29:06.088 --> 29:08.688
than in all the limos in the country.

29:09.688 --> 29:11.888
- Yeah?
- That's true.

29:12.988 --> 29:15.387
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

29:15.788 --> 29:19.788
What is the one thing about this country
that bugs you the most?

29:20.588 --> 29:24.687
Well, I don't know.
I don't follow political issues that closely.

29:25.987 --> 29:27.987
There must be something.

29:30.488 --> 29:32.887
Whatever it is,
you should clean up this city here...

29:32.987 --> 29:37.386
because this city is like an open sewer,
it's full of filth and scum.

29:37.686 --> 29:42.986
Sometimes I can hardly take it.
Whoever becomes the President
should just...

29:43.485 --> 29:45.786
really clean it up, know what I mean?

29:45.786 --> 29:49.386
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

29:49.386 --> 29:52.786
It's like, they just never go away, you know.

29:53.885 --> 29:57.085
The President should just
clean up this whole mess here.

29:57.185 --> 30:00.385
He should flush it right down
the fucking toilet.

30:08.385 --> 30:10.985
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

30:11.185 --> 30:13.284
But it's not gonna be easy.

30:13.384 --> 30:17.084
- We'll have to make some radical changes.
- Damn straight.

30:18.384 --> 30:21.784
- Here you go, Travis. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

30:25.183 --> 30:27.884
- Nice talking to you, Travis.
- Nice talking to you, sir.

30:27.884 --> 30:32.183
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.
Thank you.

30:54.681 --> 30:57.681
Come on, man. Get me out of here, all right?

31:00.681 --> 31:01.981
Come on!

31:02.982 --> 31:07.281
Come on, baby. This is a real drag.
Don't make no scene.

31:09.382 --> 31:12.882
You wanna get busted?
What's up, bitch, be cool!

31:21.181 --> 31:23.080
Don't start no trouble.

31:24.481 --> 31:28.180
Cabbie, forget about this. It's nothing.
Be cool, bitch.

32:22.077 --> 32:24.077
Get your ass out of here.

33:32.973 --> 33:34.772
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

33:36.273 --> 33:40.872
- Did you have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.
Got a present for you.

33:45.072 --> 33:48.372
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

33:56.971 --> 34:00.871
Why'd you do that?
What else am I gonna do with my money?

34:01.671 --> 34:04.271
I wish you would've listened to this.

34:04.371 --> 34:07.271
I would've, except my record player
doesn't work now.

34:07.671 --> 34:11.670
Your stereo's broken? How can you
stand it? I couldn't live without music.

34:11.670 --> 34:15.471
I don't follow music too much.
But I would really like to. I really would.

34:15.571 --> 34:18.670
- Then you haven't heard this record yet.
- No.

34:19.870 --> 34:24.170
But I was thinking, maybe we could listen
to it on your record player.

34:24.871 --> 34:28.370
Now going back to 40 years of Chick Webb.

34:44.768 --> 34:47.668
- You've got to be kidding.
- Why?

34:47.668 --> 34:49.668
This is a dirty movie.

34:50.268 --> 34:53.068
No, this is a movie that...

34:53.068 --> 34:56.568
a lot of couples come to,
all kinds of couples go here.

34:56.768 --> 35:00.369
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I see them all the time.

35:04.568 --> 35:05.867
Come on.

35:44.865 --> 35:46.464
Excuse me!

35:46.565 --> 35:48.165
Shut the fuck up.

35:48.465 --> 35:51.565
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.
Why?

35:51.665 --> 35:55.364
I don't know why I came in here.
I don't like these movies.

35:55.564 --> 35:58.664
I didn't know you'd feel that way
about this movie.

35:58.764 --> 36:01.864
- I don't know much about movies...
- This the only kind you go to?

36:01.964 --> 36:04.865
Yeah, I come. This is not so bad.

36:04.964 --> 36:09.364
Taking me to this place is about
as exciting as you saying, "Let's fuck."

36:13.264 --> 36:16.664
There are other places,
plenty of other movies I can take you to.

36:16.664 --> 36:21.362
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you to other places.
We're just different.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.163
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

36:24.462 --> 36:27.462
- I've got to go now.
- I wanna talk to you.

36:27.462 --> 36:29.863
- I have to go.
- Wait a second.

36:29.863 --> 36:30.962
Taxi!

36:31.162 --> 36:35.362
Can't I talk to you at least?
Won't you talk to me? I didn't know...

36:35.762 --> 36:38.462
- Look, won't you take the record?
- I've already got it.

36:38.562 --> 36:41.362
But, please. I bought it for you, Betsy.

36:41.362 --> 36:43.862
Thanks. Now I've got two. Let's go.

36:43.862 --> 36:45.362
Can I call you?

36:46.861 --> 36:48.962
Jesus Christ. I got a taxi.

36:54.861 --> 36:57.360
Hello, Betsy. Hi, it's Travis.

37:00.160 --> 37:03.660
How you doing?
Listen, I'm sorry about the other night.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.660
I didn't know that's how you felt about it.

37:08.961 --> 37:13.560
I didn't know that was the way you felt.
I would've taken you somewhere else.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.860
Are you feeling better or...

37:17.560 --> 37:20.960
Maybe you had a virus or something,
24-hour virus.

37:21.460 --> 37:23.260
It can happen. Yeah.

37:28.759 --> 37:31.958
You've been working hard.
I know it's... Yeah...

37:32.058 --> 37:33.159
Okay.

37:35.158 --> 37:38.158
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

37:38.758 --> 37:41.258
in the next few days or something?

37:44.259 --> 37:49.158
How about just a cup of coffee?
I could come by the headquarters.
We could...

37:51.458 --> 37:52.658
Okay.

37:55.658 --> 37:58.058
Did you get my flowers in the...

38:00.258 --> 38:03.458
You didn't get them? I sent some flowers...

38:08.256 --> 38:11.056
Yeah, okay.

38:11.156 --> 38:14.556
Can I call you again tomorrow
or the next day?

38:15.456 --> 38:18.556
Okay. No, I'm gonna... Yeah, sure, okay.

38:19.457 --> 38:20.656
So long.

38:23.156 --> 38:26.155
<i>I tried several times to call her,
but after the first call...</i>

38:26.255 --> 38:29.455
<i>she wouldn't come to the phone any longer.</i>

38:29.455 --> 38:31.756
<i>I also sent flowers, but with no luck.</i>

38:32.156 --> 38:34.756
<i>The smell of the flowers
only made me sicker.</i>

38:34.956 --> 38:39.155
<i>The headaches got worse.
I think I got stomach cancer.</i>

38:40.055 --> 38:42.655
<i>I shouldn't complain, though.</i>

38:42.655 --> 38:45.055
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

38:45.554 --> 38:48.455
<i>You're only as healthy as you feel.</i>

38:49.354 --> 38:51.954
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

38:52.954 --> 38:56.754
<i>as you feel.</i>

39:03.654 --> 39:05.453
Thank you very much.

39:08.053 --> 39:09.754
Let's not have any trouble, okay?

39:09.854 --> 39:13.254
What? Why won't you talk to me,
or answer my calls when I call?

39:13.354 --> 39:16.253
- You think I don't know you're here?
- Let's not have trouble.

39:16.253 --> 39:17.953
- Please leave.
- Get your hands off me.

39:18.053 --> 39:19.954
- Okay, then leave.
- Know that I know.

39:20.054 --> 39:24.052
Let's not have any trouble. Please.
This is no place to do this.

39:24.552 --> 39:26.352
- Get your hands off me!
- Okay, just leave.

39:26.452 --> 39:29.352
- Take them off!
- All right! Just leave now. Come on.

39:29.852 --> 39:33.352
You're in a hell, and you're gonna die
in a hell like the rest of them!

39:33.451 --> 39:38.052
- There's a cop across the street.
- You're like them.
I'm calling the cop. Officer!

39:44.251 --> 39:47.951
Look. Don't come around here
because I'll call the police!

39:48.552 --> 39:51.952
<i>I realize now how much
she's just like the others.</i>

39:52.052 --> 39:55.351
<i>Cold and distant.
And many people are like that.</i>

39:55.752 --> 39:58.750
<i>Women for sure. They're like a union.</i>

40:00.250 --> 40:01.250
Cab!

40:09.549 --> 40:12.649
Pull over to the curb over there.

40:15.449 --> 40:17.350
No, don't...

40:17.750 --> 40:22.349
The fucking meter. What are you doing?
What are you doing with the meter?

40:22.449 --> 40:25.249
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

40:25.949 --> 40:28.449
Put the meter back, let the numbers go on.

40:28.449 --> 40:33.249
I don't care what I have to pay.
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

40:33.749 --> 40:35.148
Put it down.

40:36.248 --> 40:38.548
That's right. Put it down.

40:43.248 --> 40:47.747
Why are you writing?
Don't write! Put the thing down. Just sit.

40:50.947 --> 40:54.147
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over to the curb."

40:54.247 --> 40:57.647
We've pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.347
We're gonna sit.

41:18.946 --> 41:22.346
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

41:24.546 --> 41:27.846
The light, the window
up there on the second floor.

41:30.145 --> 41:33.445
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

41:34.545 --> 41:37.345
The light up in the window, second story.

41:39.645 --> 41:41.445
What, are you blind?

41:41.545 --> 41:43.345
Do you see the light?

41:44.145 --> 41:46.545
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

41:49.244 --> 41:51.443
See the woman in the window?

41:52.944 --> 41:55.443
Do you see the woman in the window?

41:57.743 --> 41:58.743
Yeah.

41:58.943 --> 42:00.943
You see the woman. Good.

42:01.043 --> 42:04.443
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

42:06.443 --> 42:08.643
But that's not my apartment.

42:11.143 --> 42:14.343
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there?

42:15.043 --> 42:19.143
You wouldn't know. I'm just saying...
But you know who lives there?

42:19.843 --> 42:22.743
A nigger lives there. How do you like that?

42:30.641 --> 42:32.342
I'm gonna kill her.

42:35.141 --> 42:39.541
There's nothing else. I'm just gonna kill her.
What do you think of that?

42:41.741 --> 42:44.241
I said, what do you think of that?

42:44.541 --> 42:45.940
Don't answer.

42:46.241 --> 42:48.841
You don't have to answer everything.

42:52.440 --> 42:55.341
I'm gonna kill her with a.44 magnum pistol.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.840
I have a.44 magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

43:00.540 --> 43:04.340
Did you ever see what a.44 magnum
would do to a woman's face?

43:04.640 --> 43:07.940
It'll fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

43:08.339 --> 43:10.839
That's what it can do to her face.

43:10.940 --> 43:15.039
Did you see what it can do
to a woman's pussy? That you should see.

43:15.539 --> 43:19.439
You should see what a.44 magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

43:26.439 --> 43:27.838
What's that?

43:27.838 --> 43:30.039
I know you must think I'm...

43:30.838 --> 43:33.838
You must think I'm pretty sick or something.

43:35.538 --> 43:37.937
Right? You think I'm pretty sick?

43:42.237 --> 43:44.937
Right? I bet you really think I'm sick.

43:45.137 --> 43:46.837
You think I'm sick?

43:57.437 --> 44:00.937
You don't have to answer that.
I'm paying for the ride.

44:02.736 --> 44:06.036
I picked up this midget.
He was very well dressed.

44:06.936 --> 44:11.537
Italian suit. Good-looking.
Had a beautiful tall blonde.
A lady midget?

44:12.137 --> 44:14.435
No, the guy was a midget.
The blonde was the lady.

44:14.535 --> 44:17.235
- I got it.
- Those midgets are funny.

44:19.135 --> 44:21.235
- Sometimes I like to hold a midget.
- Yeah?

44:21.335 --> 44:24.935
They're funny. They always want
to sit in the front seat.

44:25.935 --> 44:29.435
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

44:31.634 --> 44:35.134
They're wearing these rhinestone t-shirts.
They start arguing.

44:35.234 --> 44:39.134
They start yelling.
The other says, "You bitch!"
And starts beating him on the head.

44:39.234 --> 44:42.934
I say, "Look, I don't care what you do
in the privacy of your own home..."

44:43.034 --> 44:44.235
"...behind closed doors."

44:44.335 --> 44:48.234
"This is an American free country.
We've got a pursuit of happiness thing."

44:48.334 --> 44:53.933
"You're consenting. You're adult.
But in my fucking cab..."

44:54.133 --> 44:56.333
"...don't go busting heads."
You know what I mean?

44:56.433 --> 44:59.533
"God loves you. Do what you want."
Tell them to go to California.

44:59.533 --> 45:04.032
In California, when two fags split up,
one's got to pay the other alimony.

45:05.933 --> 45:10.232
Not bad. They're way ahead out there.
You know what I mean? California.

45:10.632 --> 45:12.833
I tell them to get out of the fucking cab.

45:12.933 --> 45:17.232
One time I saw a cop chasing this guy
with one leg. He was on crutches.

45:17.632 --> 45:18.832
The cop?

45:18.933 --> 45:22.533
No, the dude that he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

45:22.633 --> 45:25.532
Hey, Travis. You got that five you owe me?

45:27.731 --> 45:30.731
The man is loaded.

45:32.031 --> 45:36.030
I'd be broke tonight if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio at Kennedy.

45:36.330 --> 45:40.230
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach. Tipped me $5.

45:40.831 --> 45:42.930
Where's the action around?

45:43.530 --> 45:45.131
It's pretty slow.

45:45.930 --> 45:47.431
I'm shoving on.

45:48.331 --> 45:49.830
Wait.

45:50.530 --> 45:53.730
Can I talk to you for a second?
Bye, killer.

45:57.430 --> 45:58.830
Ninety-nine.

46:15.028 --> 46:19.028
You can have all you want.
Don't be hitting on me!

46:20.429 --> 46:22.929
You better take your ass out, boy!

46:28.728 --> 46:31.928
- Yeah?
- I know you and I ain't talked too much.

46:32.428 --> 46:35.328
But I figured you've been around a lot.
So you could...

46:35.428 --> 46:38.428
Shoot, that's why they call me the "Wizard."

46:40.126 --> 46:42.127
It's just that I got a...

46:42.927 --> 46:45.527
- I got a...
- Things got you down?

46:45.927 --> 46:48.627
- Yeah.
- It happens to the best of us.

46:49.826 --> 46:51.927
Yeah, it got me real down.

46:58.126 --> 47:02.826
I just want to go out
and really do something.

47:06.026 --> 47:07.826
Taxi life, you mean?

47:09.426 --> 47:10.926
Yeah, well...

47:11.826 --> 47:13.126
No, it's...

47:14.826 --> 47:16.225
I don't know.

47:18.324 --> 47:20.225
I just wanna go out...

47:21.225 --> 47:22.624
and really...

47:24.225 --> 47:25.824
I really wanna...

47:25.924 --> 47:28.824
I got some bad ideas in my head. I just...

47:31.224 --> 47:33.024
Look at it this way.

47:34.424 --> 47:37.424
A man takes a job, you know.

47:38.824 --> 47:40.324
And that job...

47:40.723 --> 47:42.524
I mean, like that...

47:42.624 --> 47:44.623
That becomes what he is.

47:45.324 --> 47:46.424
Like...

47:48.824 --> 47:54.422
you do a thing and that's what you are.
Like, I've been a cabbie for 17 years.

47:55.122 --> 47:59.123
Ten years at night.
I still don't own my own cab.
You know why?

48:00.222 --> 48:03.522
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

48:04.622 --> 48:08.022
To be on the night shift
driving somebody else's cab.

48:08.022 --> 48:09.522
You understand?

48:09.622 --> 48:13.122
I mean, you get a job, you become the job.

48:13.822 --> 48:17.522
One guy lives in Brooklyn.
One guy lives in Sutton Place.

48:17.522 --> 48:20.322
You got a lawyer. Another guy's a doctor.

48:20.322 --> 48:23.121
Another guy dies. Another guy gets well.

48:23.721 --> 48:25.322
People are born.

48:25.522 --> 48:27.422
I envy you, your youth.

48:29.021 --> 48:30.620
Go on, get laid.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.520
Get drunk. Do anything.

48:35.121 --> 48:38.920
Because you got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

48:39.820 --> 48:41.220
More or less.

48:45.920 --> 48:49.620
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

48:51.719 --> 48:56.220
It's not Bertrand Russell.
What do you want? I'm a cabbie.
What do I know?

48:56.420 --> 49:01.019
I don't even know
what the fuck you're talking about.
Maybe I don't know either.

49:03.020 --> 49:04.819
Don't worry so much.

49:05.519 --> 49:10.319
Relax, killer. You're gonna be all right.
I know. I've seen a lot of people, and...

49:11.618 --> 49:13.218
- I know.
- Okay.

49:14.518 --> 49:15.918
Thanks, man.

49:17.518 --> 49:18.818
I guess...

49:21.418 --> 49:23.617
Yeah, you're all right.

49:42.717 --> 49:46.916
<i>What do you think of your opponent's
chances in the up and coming primary?</i>

49:47.516 --> 49:49.216
<i>Mr. Goodwin is a fine man.</i>

49:49.316 --> 49:52.515
<i>I would certainly,
if it came to it, prefer him...</i>

49:52.916 --> 49:55.415
<i>to our opponent in the other party.</i>

49:55.515 --> 49:59.115
<i>I think that my programs
are better defined than his.</i>

49:59.415 --> 50:03.115
<i>They're more imaginative,
and I have a better chance of winning.</i>

50:03.315 --> 50:08.615
<i>I think it's academic, though, because
he's not gonna win the primary. I am.</i>

50:08.715 --> 50:11.915
<i>One more thing I'd like to ask,
and that's about your campaign.</i>

50:11.915 --> 50:14.216
<i>How do you feel your campaign's going?</i>

50:14.416 --> 50:17.616
<i>When we came up with our slogan,
"We are the people"...</i>

50:17.716 --> 50:20.714
<i>when I said, "Let the people rule"...</i>

50:20.814 --> 50:23.214
<i>I felt I was being
somewhat overly optimistic.</i>

50:23.314 --> 50:27.114
<i>I must tell you that I'm more optimistic
now than ever before.</i>

50:27.114 --> 50:30.813
<i>The people are rising to the demands
that I have made on them.</i>

50:31.213 --> 50:35.814
<i>The people are beginning to rule.
I feel it as the crowds swell.</i>

50:35.814 --> 50:40.014
<i>I know it will continue through the primary,
it will continue in Miami...</i>

50:40.114 --> 50:45.013
<i>and I know it will rise
to an unprecedented swell in November.</i>

52:12.408 --> 52:16.008
Bitch, goddamn! I'll blow her face off!
I'll kill her, god damn it!

52:16.108 --> 52:20.307
Damn! If I get my hands on her,
I'll kill her! Goddamn motherfucker!

52:20.307 --> 52:23.007
I swear I'll kill that fucking bitch!

52:23.707 --> 52:27.007
If I get my hands on her, I'll kill her!
Hey, Sport.

52:27.507 --> 52:29.607
I'll kill her! Damn it!

52:29.707 --> 52:32.907
- This guy keeps following.
- Don't look at him.

52:49.005 --> 52:50.405
Hey, guys.

52:53.405 --> 52:55.805
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

53:08.104 --> 53:11.304
<i>Loneliness has followed me
my whole life, everywhere.</i>

53:12.105 --> 53:14.105
<i>In bars, in cars.</i>

53:14.804 --> 53:17.504
<i>Sidewalks, stores, everywhere.</i>

53:18.504 --> 53:20.505
<i>There's no escape.</i>

53:20.505 --> 53:22.704
<i>I'm God's lonely man.</i>

53:26.904 --> 53:28.403
<i>June 8.</i>

53:29.003 --> 53:31.303
<i>My life has taken another turn again.</i>

53:31.703 --> 53:34.803
<i>The days move along with regularity,
over and over.</i>

53:35.403 --> 53:40.202
<i>One day indistinguishable from the next.
A long continuous chain.</i>

53:40.903 --> 53:42.803
<i>Then suddenly...</i>

53:42.903 --> 53:44.803
<i>there is change.</i>

53:59.701 --> 54:04.301
Hey, Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.
How you doing, Travis?

54:27.501 --> 54:32.300
- You got a.44 magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.
That's all right. I got money.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.400
It's a real monster.

54:35.300 --> 54:39.899
It will stop a car at 100 yards.
Put a round right through the engine block.

54:50.398 --> 54:51.799
Here you go.

54:52.399 --> 54:54.899
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

54:59.299 --> 55:00.698
Look at that.

55:02.099 --> 55:03.698
That's a beauty.

55:08.798 --> 55:12.698
I could sell this gun
to some jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

55:13.197 --> 55:16.497
But I deal high quality goods
to the right people.

55:17.697 --> 55:19.197
How about that?

55:19.997 --> 55:22.596
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

55:22.696 --> 55:25.397
In which case for you, I'd recommend...

55:25.996 --> 55:27.497
.38 snub-nose.

55:29.096 --> 55:30.497
Look at this.

55:32.896 --> 55:37.296
Look at that. That's a beautiful little gun.
It's nickel-plated, snub-nose.

55:37.997 --> 55:42.496
Otherwise the same as a service revolver.
That'll stop anything that moves.

55:42.896 --> 55:46.496
A magnum, they use that in Africa
for killing elephants.

55:46.596 --> 55:48.796
That.38, that's a fine gun.

55:54.794 --> 55:57.195
Some of these guns are like toys.

55:57.195 --> 55:58.494
That.38...

55:58.694 --> 56:00.695
you go and hammer nails with it all day...

56:00.695 --> 56:04.294
come back and it'll cut dead center
on target every time.

56:04.294 --> 56:07.994
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

56:10.694 --> 56:12.994
You interested in an automatic?

56:13.295 --> 56:16.494
It's a colt.25 automatic. It's a nice little gun.

56:17.094 --> 56:21.194
It's a beautiful little gun. Holds six shots
in the clip, one shot in the chamber.

56:21.294 --> 56:24.194
That's if you're dumb enough
to put a round in the chamber.

56:24.894 --> 56:28.393
Here, look at this. A.380 Walther.

56:29.193 --> 56:31.493
Holds eight shots in the clip.

56:32.593 --> 56:34.292
That's a nice gun.

56:34.693 --> 56:37.692
That's a beautiful little gun. Look at that.

56:40.692 --> 56:44.492
During World War II,
they used this gun to replace the P-38.

56:45.793 --> 56:47.892
Just given out to officers.

56:53.792 --> 56:55.892
Isn't that a little honey?

57:04.791 --> 57:07.691
- How much for everything?
- All together.

57:08.091 --> 57:12.390
Only a jackass would carry that cannon
in the streets like that. Here.

57:12.890 --> 57:16.490
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

57:16.690 --> 57:17.791
$40.

57:19.290 --> 57:22.290
$350 for the magnum, $250 for the.38...

57:22.590 --> 57:26.190
$125 for the.25, $150 for the.380.

57:26.490 --> 57:29.890
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

57:30.390 --> 57:33.390
How about dope? Grass, hash, coke...

57:33.490 --> 57:37.090
mescaline, downers, Nembutal,
toluol, chloral hydrates?

57:37.589 --> 57:41.288
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- I'm not interested in that stuff.

57:41.388 --> 57:44.288
I can get you crystal meth, nitrous oxide.

57:44.388 --> 57:48.488
I can get you a brand-new Cadillac
with a pink slip for $2,000.

57:57.388 --> 57:58.888
<i>June 29.</i>

57:59.988 --> 58:02.987
<i>I got to get in shape now.
Too much sitting has ruined my body.</i>

58:03.087 --> 58:05.488
<i>Too much abuse has gone on for too long.</i>

58:05.888 --> 58:10.287
<i>From now on it'll be 50 pushups
each morning, 50 pull-ups.</i>

58:10.488 --> 58:15.786
<i>There will be no more pills, no more
bad food, no more destroyers of my body.</i>

58:16.586 --> 58:21.487
<i>From now on it'll be total organization.
Every muscle must be tight.</i>

58:37.686 --> 58:41.485
<i>Look at the size of that. Oh, yeah.</i>

58:42.686 --> 58:44.685
<i>It looks so good.</i>

58:50.086 --> 58:54.084
<i>It's getting harder and harder.
It's throbbing now.</i>

58:55.984 --> 59:00.084
<i>The idea had been growing in my brain
for some time.</i>

59:00.984 --> 59:06.484
<i>True force. All the king's men
cannot put it back together again.</i>

01:01:08.077 --> 01:01:12.077
Where do get more of these?
Where do you think?
Back at the headquarters.

01:01:12.177 --> 01:01:15.877
Go all the way back there to get to town.
- Come on.
- All right. It'll work.

01:01:15.977 --> 01:01:18.775
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- It's not. I've done this 100 times.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:21.076
- You've done this before?
- Yes. Don't worry.

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:25.275
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.
Betsy?

01:01:27.576 --> 01:01:28.575
What?

01:01:29.075 --> 01:01:31.175
Betsy. Come here.

01:02:30.273 --> 01:02:33.071
You're a Secret Service man, aren't you?

01:02:34.972 --> 01:02:37.172
Just waiting for the Senator.

01:02:37.872 --> 01:02:40.171
You're waiting for the Senator?

01:02:43.871 --> 01:02:45.971
That's a very good answer.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:47.772
Shit, man.

01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:52.671
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.

01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:57.471
No. The reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man...

01:02:57.571 --> 01:03:00.071
I won't say anything, because I...

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:07.370
I saw some suspicious looking people
over there.

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:10.270
- You did?
- They were right over there.

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:17.269
They were just here. I...

01:03:20.769 --> 01:03:22.769
They were very, very...

01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:24.869
- Suspicious?
- Yeah.

01:03:27.869 --> 01:03:29.469
Where'd they go?

01:03:30.869 --> 01:03:34.769
Is it hard to get to be in the Secret Service?
Why?

01:03:34.969 --> 01:03:39.269
I was just curious,
'cause I think I'd be good at it.
I'm very observant.

01:03:40.168 --> 01:03:42.269
I was in the Marine Corps.

01:03:43.268 --> 01:03:45.068
I'm good with crowds.

01:03:47.467 --> 01:03:51.667
I notice there's a little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:53.467
- Sort of.
- Signal.

01:03:53.567 --> 01:03:56.267
A secret signal for the Secret Service.

01:04:00.067 --> 01:04:05.666
What kind of guns you guys carry?
.38s?.45s?.357 magnums?

01:04:05.866 --> 01:04:07.567
Something bigger maybe?

01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:12.166
Look, if you're really interested,
if you give me your name and address...

01:04:12.566 --> 01:04:16.466
we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

01:04:18.566 --> 01:04:20.967
- You will?
- Sure.
Okay.

01:04:21.865 --> 01:04:23.065
Why not?

01:04:26.865 --> 01:04:28.565
My name is Henry...

01:04:30.265 --> 01:04:32.265
Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

01:04:36.265 --> 01:04:38.965
154 Hopper Avenue.

01:04:40.664 --> 01:04:42.265
- Hopper.
- Yeah.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.964
Like a rabbit. Hip, hop.

01:04:50.664 --> 01:04:52.465
Fairlawn, New Jersey.

01:04:55.564 --> 01:04:59.063
- Is there a zip code with that, Henry?
- Yeah. 610452.

01:05:02.163 --> 01:05:04.363
- Okay.
- That's six digits.

01:05:06.863 --> 01:05:08.663
61045.

01:05:10.463 --> 01:05:11.463
Okay.

01:05:12.462 --> 01:05:15.163
I was thinking of my telephone number.

01:05:15.762 --> 01:05:19.762
I've got it all, Henry,
we'll get all the stuff right out to you.

01:05:20.062 --> 01:05:23.162
Thanks a lot. Great. Hell. Jesus.

01:05:23.762 --> 01:05:25.762
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

01:05:25.862 --> 01:05:29.762
You have to be careful
living around a place like this.
Bye.

01:05:37.761 --> 01:05:38.961
Damn it.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.159
Faster than you, you fucking son of a...

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.659
I saw you coming, you fucking shit-heel.

01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:21.659
I'm standing here. You make the move.

01:06:24.058 --> 01:06:25.559
It's your move.

01:06:28.959 --> 01:06:30.858
Don't try it, you fuck.

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:39.258
You talking to me?

01:06:49.557 --> 01:06:53.357
Then who the hell else are you talking to?
You talking to me?

01:06:53.557 --> 01:06:55.456
I'm the only one here.

01:06:57.357 --> 01:07:00.357
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

01:07:01.057 --> 01:07:02.256
Oh, yeah?

01:07:04.856 --> 01:07:05.856
Okay.

01:07:13.556 --> 01:07:16.056
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

01:07:16.256 --> 01:07:20.855
<i>Here is a man
who would not take it anymore.
Who would not let...</i>

01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:24.554
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

01:07:24.854 --> 01:07:28.154
<i>Here is a man
who would not take it anymore.</i>

01:07:28.254 --> 01:07:33.055
<i>A man who stood up against the scum,
the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.</i>

01:07:33.055 --> 01:07:35.654
<i>Here is someone who stood up.</i>

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:38.654
<i>Here is...</i>

01:07:43.354 --> 01:07:44.754
You're dead.

01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:27.452
Yeah, man?

01:08:27.452 --> 01:08:31.251
Shut your mouth. Give me the cash
out of the drawer. Come on.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:33.452
Let's go. Give me the goddamn cash.

01:08:33.551 --> 01:08:36.852
- Don't shoot. I'm getting it.
- Stop taking so long. Come on.

01:08:37.252 --> 01:08:39.751
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.850
- This all you got? Get the rest.
- That's it.

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:44.450
- I don't have any more.
- Give me the rest of the cash.

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:46.149
- That's all I got.
- Give me more.

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:48.950
- I got no money.
- Reach in your sock. You got more bread.

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:52.750
- That's it, man.
- Give me the rest of the fucking bread.

01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:59.649
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:05.750
Shit, man.

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.750
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

01:09:17.247 --> 01:09:21.848
Listen, I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:27.247
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

01:09:27.348 --> 01:09:29.848
- Can I give you some money?
- No. Just get out of here.

01:09:29.848 --> 01:09:32.647
No, man. I'll take care of it. Go ahead.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:40.948
That's the fifth motherfucker this year.
You wanna buy that little dope?

01:11:24.941 --> 01:11:28.141
<i>Walt Whitman, that great American poet...</i>

01:11:28.141 --> 01:11:34.441
<i>spoke for all of us when he said:
"I am the man. I suffered. I was there."</i>

01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:38.141
<i>Today I say to you, we are the people.</i>

01:11:38.841 --> 01:11:41.540
<i>We suffered. We were there.</i>

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:47.639
<i>We, the people, suffered in Vietnam.</i>

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.239
<i>We, the people, suffered,
we still suffer from unemployment...</i>

01:11:53.239 --> 01:11:56.639
<i>inflation, crime and corruption.</i>

01:11:59.939 --> 01:12:02.239
<i>"Dear Father and Mother."</i>

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:05.239
<i>"July is the month I remember
which brings..."</i>

01:12:05.339 --> 01:12:07.839
<i>"...not only your wedding anniversary...</i>

01:12:07.939 --> 01:12:11.239
<i>"...but also Father's Day
and Mother's birthday."</i>

01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:14.539
<i>"I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates..."</i>

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:18.438
<i>"...but I hope this card
will take care of them all."</i>

01:12:18.638 --> 01:12:22.137
<i>"I'm sorry again
I cannot send you my address..."</i>

01:12:22.237 --> 01:12:24.838
<i>"...like I promised to last year."</i>

01:12:24.838 --> 01:12:27.638
<i>"But the sensitive nature of my work
for the government..."</i>

01:12:27.738 --> 01:12:30.037
<i>"...demands utmost secrecy."</i>

01:12:30.637 --> 01:12:34.137
<i>"I know you will understand."</i>

01:12:34.237 --> 01:12:37.137
<i>"I am healthy and well,
and making lots of money."</i>

01:12:37.137 --> 01:12:39.537
<i>"I have been going with a girl
for several months..."</i>

01:12:39.637 --> 01:12:42.637
<i>"...and I know you would be proud
if you could see her."</i>

01:12:42.637 --> 01:12:46.337
<i>"Here name is Betsy,
but I can tell you no more than that."</i>

01:12:46.837 --> 01:12:49.237
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

01:12:50.637 --> 01:12:53.337
Come on, let's go. Move it.

01:12:53.637 --> 01:12:59.135
<i>No more will we, the people...
bear the burden of suffering for the few.</i>

01:13:00.036 --> 01:13:03.536
<i>No more will we fight the wars of the few...</i>

01:13:03.636 --> 01:13:05.935
<i>to the harm of the many.</i>

01:13:09.435 --> 01:13:13.434
<i>"I hope this card finds you all well
as it does me."</i>

01:13:13.635 --> 01:13:16.834
<i>"I hope no one has died.
Don't worry about me."</i>

01:13:17.235 --> 01:13:20.935
<i>"One day there'll be a knock on the door,
and it'll be me."</i>

01:13:21.435 --> 01:13:23.334
<i>"Love, Travis."</i>

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:32.234
<i>- Don't you have some idea?
- I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

01:13:32.234 --> 01:13:34.133
<i>- Don't you have some idea?
- I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

01:13:34.433 --> 01:13:37.833
<i>But you must know that the reason
I didn't marry him...</i>

01:13:38.434 --> 01:13:42.533
<i>is because I couldn't stand
to be a cause of divorce.</i>

01:13:45.033 --> 01:13:49.333
<i>Now, he's getting a divorce anyway, and...</i>

01:13:52.132 --> 01:13:54.933
<i>Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.</i>

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:59.632
<i>I do love him.</i>

01:14:04.033 --> 01:14:06.132
<i>What about us, June?</i>

01:14:07.332 --> 01:14:09.131
<i>Our marriage?</i>

01:14:11.731 --> 01:14:14.132
<i>You've got to know
that our marriage wasn't legal.</i>

01:14:14.132 --> 01:14:17.031
<i>In the eyes of God, we are married.</i>

01:14:19.431 --> 01:14:23.631
<i>Brock, please don't do this to me.</i>

01:14:26.231 --> 01:14:28.030
<i>I love him...</i>

01:14:36.331 --> 01:14:37.430
Damn!

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:40.630
Goddamn!

01:15:16.128 --> 01:15:18.528
Are you trying to get rid of me?

01:15:22.227 --> 01:15:24.926
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

01:15:28.126 --> 01:15:30.827
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:33.927
All right. You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

01:15:34.027 --> 01:15:37.027
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

01:15:41.226 --> 01:15:44.426
Is your name Matthew? I want some action.

01:15:45.026 --> 01:15:46.427
Officer...

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:51.326
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

01:15:51.626 --> 01:15:54.126
You gonna bust me for nothing, man?

01:15:54.226 --> 01:15:55.826
I'm not a cop.

01:15:56.626 --> 01:15:59.725
- I ain't no cop.
- Then why ask me for action?

01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:03.624
Because she sent me over.

01:16:06.025 --> 01:16:11.024
I suppose that ain't a.38
you got in your sock.
.38? No.

01:16:12.225 --> 01:16:13.824
I'm clean, man.

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:17.724
- Shit. You're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

01:16:18.124 --> 01:16:19.524
That's nice.

01:16:20.724 --> 01:16:25.224
It's all right.
$15, 15 minutes. $25, half an hour.

01:16:27.024 --> 01:16:28.124
Shit.

01:16:29.023 --> 01:16:30.424
Cowboy, huh?

01:16:32.024 --> 01:16:36.022
I once had a horse in Coney Island.
She got hit by a car.

01:16:38.822 --> 01:16:40.623
Take it or leave it.

01:16:40.823 --> 01:16:44.123
If you wanna save yourself some money,
don't fuck her.

01:16:44.223 --> 01:16:46.122
'Cause you'll be back every night
for more.

01:16:46.122 --> 01:16:50.623
She's twelve-and-a-half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

01:16:50.823 --> 01:16:52.322
You can do anything with her...

01:16:52.422 --> 01:16:56.122
come on her, fuck her in the mouth,
fuck her in the ass, come on her face.

01:16:56.222 --> 01:16:59.622
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

01:17:01.622 --> 01:17:04.122
But no rough stuff. All right?

01:17:09.722 --> 01:17:11.721
All right, I'll take it.

01:17:11.921 --> 01:17:14.620
Hey, man! Take out no money over here.

01:17:15.621 --> 01:17:20.021
You gonna fuck me?
You're gonna fuck her.
You give her the money.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.520
Catch you later, copper.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:27.420
- What did you say?
- See you later, copper.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.620
I'm no cop, man.

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.420
If you are, it's entrapment already.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.519
I'm hip.

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.520
Buddy, you don't look hip.

01:17:46.319 --> 01:17:48.919
Go ahead, have yourself a good time.

01:17:57.818 --> 01:17:59.618
You're a funny guy.

01:18:02.818 --> 01:18:05.018
But looks aren't everything.

01:18:05.318 --> 01:18:07.418
Go ahead, have a good time.

01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:14.318
You're a funny guy.

01:18:56.615 --> 01:18:58.716
The room will cost you $10.

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:13.514
I'm timing you, too.

01:19:32.613 --> 01:19:33.813
Come on.

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:46.112
Are you really twelve-and-a-half?

01:19:47.712 --> 01:19:51.411
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

01:19:54.012 --> 01:19:57.112
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

01:20:01.211 --> 01:20:02.812
How old are you?

01:20:04.711 --> 01:20:06.812
You don't want to tell me?

01:20:06.812 --> 01:20:09.612
- What's your name?
- Easy.

01:20:10.211 --> 01:20:15.410
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.
But what's your real name?

01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:19.510
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?

01:20:23.609 --> 01:20:24.710
Iris.

01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:30.009
What's wrong with that? That's a nice name.
That's what you think.

01:20:36.909 --> 01:20:40.409
No, don't do that. Don't you remember me?

01:20:41.109 --> 01:20:44.709
Remember when you got into a taxi?
It was a checker taxi.

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:49.409
You got in and that guy Matthew came by
and he said he wanted to take you away.

01:20:49.608 --> 01:20:51.408
He pulled you away.

01:20:52.808 --> 01:20:54.908
No, I don't remember that.

01:20:55.708 --> 01:20:58.407
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

01:20:59.608 --> 01:21:01.907
That's all right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:21:02.007 --> 01:21:05.407
We better make it or Sport will get mad.
How do you wanna make it?

01:21:05.407 --> 01:21:09.907
I don't want to make it. Who's Sport?
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

01:21:15.207 --> 01:21:17.308
Want to make it like this?

01:21:23.307 --> 01:21:26.606
Listen, I...
Can't you understand something?

01:21:26.706 --> 01:21:30.306
You're the one who came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

01:21:30.306 --> 01:21:32.306
I must have been stoned.

01:21:32.406 --> 01:21:35.806
What do you mean? They drug you?
Come off it, man.

01:21:37.305 --> 01:21:39.106
What are you doing?

01:21:39.406 --> 01:21:41.405
Don't you wanna make it?

01:21:44.705 --> 01:21:47.705
No, I don't wanna make it. I wanna help you.

01:21:47.805 --> 01:21:49.605
Well, I can help you.

01:21:54.005 --> 01:21:57.405
Damn, man! Goddamn it!

01:22:01.805 --> 01:22:04.904
Shit, man!
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:22:06.103 --> 01:22:10.604
You don't have to make it, mister.
Goddamn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

01:22:12.503 --> 01:22:15.104
Can't you understand why I came here?

01:22:15.603 --> 01:22:17.804
I think I understand.

01:22:19.703 --> 01:22:24.003
I tried to get into your cab one night,
and now you wanna take me away.

01:22:25.403 --> 01:22:26.703
Is that it?

01:22:26.703 --> 01:22:29.003
Yeah, but don't you want to go?

01:22:29.203 --> 01:22:33.203
I can leave anytime I want to.
Then what about that one night?

01:22:35.102 --> 01:22:36.903
Look, I was stoned.

01:22:39.502 --> 01:22:41.701
That's why they stopped me.

01:22:43.602 --> 01:22:46.702
When I'm not stoned,
I got no place else to go.

01:22:47.901 --> 01:22:52.201
So they just protect me from myself.

01:22:58.301 --> 01:23:00.701
No. I don't know.

01:23:03.901 --> 01:23:06.101
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.201
Look, I understand.

01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:12.001
And it means something, really.

01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:19.699
Look, can I see you again?
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

01:23:19.799 --> 01:23:23.799
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:29.199
All right. How about breakfast tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, when?
- I get up at about 1:00.

01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:35.598
Well, I got a thing...

01:23:35.598 --> 01:23:40.299
Come on, do you want to or not?
Yeah, I want... Okay, all right. 1:00.

01:23:42.298 --> 01:23:43.899
See you tomorrow.

01:23:44.998 --> 01:23:48.099
Iris, my name is Travis.

01:23:49.098 --> 01:23:50.899
Thanks a lot, Travis.

01:23:52.997 --> 01:23:55.697
So long, Iris. See you tomorrow.

01:23:57.598 --> 01:23:58.997
Sweet Iris.

01:24:23.596 --> 01:24:25.096
This is yours.

01:24:25.597 --> 01:24:27.196
Spend it right.

01:24:32.696 --> 01:24:36.095
- Come back anytime, cowboy.
- I will.

01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:58.095
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

01:24:58.395 --> 01:25:02.194
I mean, they hate me.
Why do you think I split in the first place?

01:25:02.294 --> 01:25:06.893
There ain't nothing there.
Yeah, but you can't live like this. It's a hell.

01:25:07.293 --> 01:25:09.393
A girl should live at home.

01:25:10.093 --> 01:25:13.993
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
What do you mean, women's lib?

01:25:14.093 --> 01:25:17.093
You're a young girl.
You should be home now.

01:25:17.193 --> 01:25:21.192
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys, going to school.

01:25:21.292 --> 01:25:24.792
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- God, are you square.

01:25:24.992 --> 01:25:29.292
Hey, I'm not square.
You're the one that's square.
You're full of shit, man.

01:25:29.392 --> 01:25:32.692
What are you talking about?
You walk out with those fucking creeps...

01:25:32.792 --> 01:25:37.992
lowlifes and degenerates out on the street
and you sell your little pussy for nothing...

01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:41.692
for some lowlife pimp
who stands in a hole?

01:25:43.691 --> 01:25:46.791
I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:50.891
I don't screw and fuck with a bunch
of killers and junkies the way you do.

01:25:51.191 --> 01:25:53.191
You call that being hip?

01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:55.791
What world you from?

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:04.390
- Who's a killer?
- Sport's a killer, that's who's a killer.

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.590
- Sport never killed nobody.
- He killed somebody.

01:26:06.690 --> 01:26:08.691
- He's a Libra.
- He's a what?

01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:12.090
I'm a Libra, too.
That's why we get along so well.

01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:16.790
He looks like a killer to me.

01:26:17.490 --> 01:26:20.689
I think that Cancers make the best lovers...

01:26:20.789 --> 01:26:25.488
but, God, my whole family are earth signs.
He's also a dope shooter.

01:26:25.988 --> 01:26:29.588
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

01:26:29.588 --> 01:26:33.489
Didn't you ever try looking
at your own eyeballs in the mirror?

01:26:38.488 --> 01:26:41.189
So what are you gonna do
about Sport and that old bastard?

01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:43.188
- When?
- When you leave.

01:26:46.688 --> 01:26:49.388
- I don't know. Just leave them.
- You're just gonna leave?

01:26:49.488 --> 01:26:54.287
- They've got plenty of other girls.
- You just can't do that. What will you do?

01:26:56.287 --> 01:27:00.387
- What do you want me to do, call the cops?
- Cops don't do nothing. You know that.

01:27:00.886 --> 01:27:04.786
Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up
or anything like that once.

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:08.286
But you can't allow him
to do the same to other girls.

01:27:08.386 --> 01:27:12.787
You can't allow him to do that.
He's the lowest kind of person in the world.

01:27:12.887 --> 01:27:16.487
Somebody's got to do something to him.
He's the scum of the earth.

01:27:16.587 --> 01:27:20.286
He's the worst sucking scum...

01:27:20.286 --> 01:27:22.186
I have ever seen.

01:27:24.486 --> 01:27:26.986
You know what he told me about you?

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:33.284
He's calling you names.
He called you a little piece of chicken.

01:27:34.685 --> 01:27:36.884
He doesn't mean that.

01:27:39.584 --> 01:27:42.784
I'll move up to one
of them communes in Vermont.

01:27:47.584 --> 01:27:52.084
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know, you know?
I saw...

01:27:53.384 --> 01:27:56.884
some pictures once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

01:27:56.884 --> 01:28:02.183
Why don't you come
to the commune with me?
What, come to the commune with you? No.

01:28:02.984 --> 01:28:04.184
Why not?

01:28:06.184 --> 01:28:08.483
I don't go to places like that.

01:28:09.382 --> 01:28:12.782
- Come on, why not?
- I don't get along with people like that.

01:28:12.882 --> 01:28:14.982
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

01:28:14.982 --> 01:28:18.382
That's it, you're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

01:28:19.182 --> 01:28:21.382
Besides, I got to stay here.

01:28:21.782 --> 01:28:26.582
- Come on, why?
- I got something very important to do.
What's so important?

01:28:28.082 --> 01:28:30.581
Doing something for the government.

01:28:31.182 --> 01:28:33.581
The cab thing is just part-time.

01:28:34.582 --> 01:28:36.082
Are you a narc?

01:28:38.782 --> 01:28:41.482
- Do I look like a narc?
- Yeah.

01:28:43.082 --> 01:28:44.481
I am a narc.

01:28:45.881 --> 01:28:48.981
God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.980
Sure you don't wanna come with me?

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.280
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you the money to go.

01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:03.080
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, I want you to take it.

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.179
I don't want you to take anything from them.

01:29:06.179 --> 01:29:07.880
And I wanna do it.

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:11.380
I don't have anything better to do
with my money.

01:29:12.579 --> 01:29:15.080
I might be going away for a while.

01:29:40.678 --> 01:29:43.378
You're just a little tense, that's all.

01:29:44.177 --> 01:29:46.678
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

01:29:46.978 --> 01:29:50.078
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

01:29:50.078 --> 01:29:54.077
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

01:29:55.777 --> 01:30:01.076
You never spend any time with me anymore.
I've got to attend to business, baby.

01:30:02.576 --> 01:30:04.776
You miss your man, don't you?

01:30:06.376 --> 01:30:09.276
I don't like to be away from you, either.

01:30:10.075 --> 01:30:12.376
You know how I feel about you.

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:15.276
I depend on you.

01:30:17.976 --> 01:30:19.975
I'd be lost without you.

01:30:20.875 --> 01:30:22.975
Don't you ever forget that.

01:30:32.575 --> 01:30:34.375
How much I need you.

01:30:37.074 --> 01:30:38.673
Come to me, baby.

01:30:48.973 --> 01:30:50.574
Let me hold you.

01:30:57.474 --> 01:31:01.073
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

01:31:06.173 --> 01:31:10.273
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

01:31:15.772 --> 01:31:18.072
That every woman everywhere...

01:31:20.371 --> 01:31:23.172
had a man that loves her like I love you.

01:31:27.371 --> 01:31:30.171
God, it's good so close.

01:31:42.671 --> 01:31:47.271
You know, at times like this,
I know I'm a lucky man.

01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:53.670
Touching a woman
who wants me and needs me.

01:31:59.869 --> 01:32:02.769
Yeah, it's only you that keeps me together.

01:33:35.664 --> 01:33:39.563
<i>Now I see it clearly.
My whole life is pointed in one direction.</i>

01:33:39.963 --> 01:33:41.863
<i>I see that now.</i>

01:33:42.563 --> 01:33:45.663
<i>There never has been any choice for me.</i>

01:34:20.861 --> 01:34:24.261
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the next president of the United States...</i>

01:34:24.361 --> 01:34:26.761
<i>Senator Charles Palantine.</i>

01:34:32.461 --> 01:34:34.361
<i>Thank you, Tom.</i>

01:34:35.261 --> 01:34:36.860
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:34:37.061 --> 01:34:41.161
<i>we are met today at a crossroads:
Columbus Circle.</i>

01:34:41.861 --> 01:34:44.261
<i>This is no ordinary place.</i>

01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:47.060
<i>It is a place where many roads...</i>

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.660
<i>and many lives intersect.</i>

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.059
<i>It is appropriate that we meet here today...</i>

01:34:53.159 --> 01:34:56.159
<i>because these are not ordinary times.</i>

01:34:56.659 --> 01:35:00.159
<i>We meet at a crossroads in history.</i>

01:35:01.159 --> 01:35:05.158
<i>For far too long,
the wrong roads have been taken.</i>

01:35:05.158 --> 01:35:08.258
<i>The wrong roads have led us into war...</i>

01:35:08.258 --> 01:35:12.358
<i>into poverty, into unemployment
and inflation.</i>

01:35:13.459 --> 01:35:17.658
<i>Today I say to you,
we have reached the turning point.</i>

01:35:20.858 --> 01:35:25.058
<i>No longer will we, the people,
suffer for the few.</i>

01:35:33.357 --> 01:35:38.157
<i>Now, I would lie to you if I told you
the new roads would be easy.</i>

01:35:38.357 --> 01:35:40.556
<i>They will not be easy.</i>

01:35:40.656 --> 01:35:44.356
<i>Nothing that is right and good
has ever been easy.</i>

01:35:44.456 --> 01:35:46.856
<i>We, the people, know that.</i>

01:35:50.356 --> 01:35:54.656
<i>And we, the people,
know the right roads and the good.</i>

01:35:55.757 --> 01:35:59.956
<i>Today I say to you,
we are the people, you and I...</i>

01:36:00.056 --> 01:36:03.256
<i>and it is time to let the people rule.</i>

01:36:03.356 --> 01:36:04.955
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:36:20.955 --> 01:36:23.354
All right, let him go, pull back.

01:36:28.254 --> 01:36:29.554
Palantine!

01:36:38.154 --> 01:36:39.454
Thank you.

01:36:44.652 --> 01:36:46.653
Over there. Get that man.

01:36:48.352 --> 01:36:50.053
Give him some air!

01:36:50.453 --> 01:36:52.653
Give him some air, will you?

01:36:52.953 --> 01:36:55.452
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

01:36:55.652 --> 01:36:57.152
Where was he?

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:26.450
- What's happening?
- How you doing?
Got the money?

01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:39.650
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

01:38:16.048 --> 01:38:18.148
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

01:38:18.248 --> 01:38:20.347
Okay, my man. How are you?

01:38:21.848 --> 01:38:24.748
- Where do I know you from?
- I don't know.

01:38:25.048 --> 01:38:27.747
How's everything in the pimp business?

01:38:28.348 --> 01:38:31.646
- Do I know you?
- No. Do I know you?

01:38:32.647 --> 01:38:36.147
- Get out of here. Come on, get lost.
- Do I know you?

01:38:38.446 --> 01:38:39.746
How's Iris?

01:38:40.046 --> 01:38:41.546
You know, Iris.

01:38:41.746 --> 01:38:44.046
I don't know nobody named Iris.

01:38:44.646 --> 01:38:47.246
Iris. Come on, get out of here, man.

01:38:47.246 --> 01:38:51.846
You don't know anybody
by the name of Iris?
I don't know nobody named Iris.

01:38:52.545 --> 01:38:53.546
No?

01:38:53.646 --> 01:38:56.245
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

01:38:56.245 --> 01:38:59.245
Do me a favor.
I don't want no trouble, okay?

01:39:00.746 --> 01:39:02.245
You got a gun?

01:39:03.746 --> 01:39:06.845
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

01:39:07.045 --> 01:39:08.544
Suck on this.

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:25.040
You crazy son of a bitch!

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.839
Fucking son of a bitch, you! I'll kill you!

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:35.139
I'll fucking kill you!

01:40:35.139 --> 01:40:37.740
Crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

01:40:56.239 --> 01:40:59.138
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

01:40:59.838 --> 01:41:03.238
You crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

01:41:10.237 --> 01:41:11.337
Stop!

01:41:24.137 --> 01:41:26.038
No! Don't shoot him!

01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:10.721
<i>"Dear Mr. Bickle...
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were..."</i>

01:46:10.821 --> 01:46:14.121
<i>"...to hear that you are well and recuperating."</i>

01:46:14.421 --> 01:46:17.220
<i>"We tried to visit you at the hospital..."</i>

01:46:17.521 --> 01:46:22.720
<i>"...when we were in New York to pick up Iris.
But you were still in a coma."</i>

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.219
<i>"There is no way we can repay you
for returning our Iris to us."</i>

01:46:28.919 --> 01:46:33.719
<i>"We thought we had lost her,
and now our lives are full again."</i>

01:46:34.418 --> 01:46:36.019
<i>"Needless to say..."</i>

01:46:36.019 --> 01:46:40.019
<i>"...you are something of a hero
around this household."</i>

01:46:41.318 --> 01:46:44.818
<i>"I'm sure you want to know about Iris."</i>

01:46:45.018 --> 01:46:48.418
<i>"She's back in school and working hard."</i>

01:46:49.018 --> 01:46:53.918
<i>"The transition has been very hard for her,
as you can well imagine."</i>

01:46:54.418 --> 01:47:00.118
<i>"But we have taken steps to see...
she has never cause to run away again."</i>

01:47:01.518 --> 01:47:05.117
<i>"In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I..."</i>

01:47:05.217 --> 01:47:09.716
<i>"...would like to again thank you
from the bottom of our hearts."</i>

01:47:10.016 --> 01:47:14.016
<i>"Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again..."</i>

01:47:14.216 --> 01:47:17.716
<i>"...to thank you in person, or we surely would."</i>

01:47:18.417 --> 01:47:21.417
<i>"But if you should ever come
to Pittsburgh..."</i>

01:47:21.517 --> 01:47:25.916
<i>"...you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home."</i>

01:47:26.316 --> 01:47:28.416
<i>"Our deepest thanks."</i>

01:47:28.616 --> 01:47:30.916
<i>"Burt and Ivy Steensma."</i>

01:47:32.816 --> 01:47:35.515
This guy Eddie, the owner-operator,
comes up and says:

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:39.115
"I want to swap tires."
I said, "These are new tires."

01:47:39.115 --> 01:47:44.215
"Why don't you throw in something else,
like your wife?"
His wife was Miss New Jersey 1957.

01:47:44.215 --> 01:47:48.514
That's why the fleet has no spares.
Doughboy, wizard, killer.

01:47:49.014 --> 01:47:51.414
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

01:47:52.014 --> 01:47:53.915
Travis, you got a fare.

01:47:55.514 --> 01:47:56.514
Shit.

01:47:58.014 --> 01:48:00.515
- See you later.
- See you, Travis.

01:48:21.913 --> 01:48:23.412
Hello, Travis.

01:48:25.112 --> 01:48:26.312
Hello.

01:48:47.212 --> 01:48:49.811
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

01:48:51.212 --> 01:48:54.311
Yeah. Won't be long now. Seventeen days.

01:48:55.610 --> 01:48:57.110
I hope he wins.

01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:14.409
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:19.710
It was nothing, really. I got over that.

01:49:22.209 --> 01:49:24.709
Papers always blow these things up.

01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:29.309
Just a little stiffness, that's all.

01:50:13.706 --> 01:50:15.306
How much was it?

01:50:24.506 --> 01:50:25.705
So long.

01:50:26.305 --> 01:50:32.675
