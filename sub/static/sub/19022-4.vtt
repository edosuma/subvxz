WEBVTT

00:00.429 --> 00:01.929
Previously on "Six"...

00:01.932 --> 00:03.727
All we know is that the hostages

00:03.727 --> 00:06.207
are approximately 120
kilometers east of Lagos,

00:06.208 --> 00:07.967
just north of Okomu National Park.

00:07.968 --> 00:10.927
We have every available
intelligence asset on it.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.807
That's the man that killed my brother.

00:12.808 --> 00:14.203
No. No. No!

00:14.206 --> 00:15.567
I want him.

00:15.568 --> 00:18.407
But I don't want this SEAL
to distract you from our goal.

00:18.408 --> 00:20.691
We can use him... For the cause.

00:21.027 --> 00:23.895
_

00:24.368 --> 00:26.927
Navy SEAL wants to bring help, yes?

00:26.928 --> 00:28.306
This is the help you bring.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:38.728 --> 00:40.128
Run!

00:50.328 --> 00:51.448
Richard!

00:54.968 --> 00:56.328
Okay!

00:58.168 --> 00:59.888
Put your weapon down.

02:18.048 --> 02:20.247
I told you this would happen.

02:20.248 --> 02:22.528
Next time, it will be all of you.

02:32.808 --> 02:35.807
I was supposed to
call my grandson today.

02:35.808 --> 02:38.127
It's his birthday.

02:38.128 --> 02:40.247
He's turning 14.

02:40.248 --> 02:42.448
It just goes so fast.

02:45.768 --> 02:47.367
Terry.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.567
Terry?

02:48.568 --> 02:50.490
Tell me about your grandson.

02:50.493 --> 02:52.287
What's his name?

02:52.288 --> 02:53.647
Jake.

02:53.648 --> 02:55.967
Jake. Yeah.

02:55.968 --> 02:59.287
He loves all that SEAL stuff.

02:59.288 --> 03:03.407
He's already talking
about going to... BUD/S.

03:03.408 --> 03:06.567
Well, maybe I can meet him someday.

03:06.568 --> 03:07.607
Talk him out of it.

03:09.368 --> 03:13.712
For him and his buddies, you
guys are like superheroes.

03:29.688 --> 03:31.567
Bear.

03:31.568 --> 03:34.167
Bear.

03:34.168 --> 03:35.607
Bear!

03:37.408 --> 03:38.767
What?

03:38.768 --> 03:40.007
Doughnuts.

03:40.008 --> 03:42.527
I fought five cops for them.

03:42.528 --> 03:43.727
No.

03:43.728 --> 03:46.567
Come on, man. You got to eat.

03:46.568 --> 03:48.927
Come on, dude. Don't
tell me you slept here.

03:48.928 --> 03:51.127
'Course he did. Lena's been
calling my phone all night.

03:51.128 --> 03:52.567
Mine too.

03:52.568 --> 03:53.983
Look, I got to go up to Intel.

03:53.986 --> 03:54.967
Hey, I've already been.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.367
Well, maybe they missed something.

03:56.368 --> 03:59.247
Bear. You have a doctor's appointment.

03:59.248 --> 04:01.607
Okay? Get yourself cleaned
up, and go pick up Lena.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.680
Jesus, Bear. Look like you
fell asleep in the gator pen.

04:04.683 --> 04:05.922
Thank you.

04:05.925 --> 04:07.004
We heard any news on Rip?

04:07.007 --> 04:07.847
No updates.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.887
Maybe no news is good news.

04:10.888 --> 04:13.847
If you hear anything, you let me know.

04:13.848 --> 04:15.388
Tighten him up.

04:17.447 --> 04:18.726
Saddle up, son.

04:18.728 --> 04:20.247
We're about to have some fun.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.899
Give that one to Chase.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.979
But, Buck, you hit dead center.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.499
We're at 4-4.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.739
All right, Ghetto, reset.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.994
We're going again?

05:24.997 --> 05:25.915
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:25.918 --> 05:27.459
You got somewhere else you need to be?

05:27.460 --> 05:29.463
How 'bout you, Fishbait? You
got anywhere else to run off to?

05:29.465 --> 05:30.539
- Nope.
- Why is that?

05:30.540 --> 05:32.259
It's because I'm all-in.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.916
That's cute. You practice that?

05:34.919 --> 05:36.438
Didn't have to.

05:36.441 --> 05:38.200
See, Fish here prays five times a day...

05:38.203 --> 05:40.499
"Allahu Akbar," all that nonsense.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.580
- See, it don't matter to us.
- Eh, that's debatable.

05:42.581 --> 05:44.739
'Cause Fish, we know he's
here for all the right reasons.

05:44.740 --> 05:47.219
And there ain't nothing
worse than a Muslim raghead...

05:47.220 --> 05:48.939
except for a Harvard bitch.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.739
You know that, Caulder,
about old Ghetto here?

05:50.740 --> 05:52.419
It's a lot to overcome, that's true.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.058
Harvard, Navy SEAL, man of color...

05:55.061 --> 05:56.939
You got the trifecta working for you.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.219
Punch your ticket here a couple years,

05:58.220 --> 05:59.339
sell out, run for Congress?

05:59.340 --> 06:00.619
That's the plan, right?

06:00.620 --> 06:02.899
Yeah. Yeah, you gonna vote for me?

06:02.900 --> 06:05.045
I'd vote for you if
politics still mattered.

06:05.048 --> 06:06.899
Hell, no, I ain't voting for you.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.259
My granddaddy'd be
twerking in his grave.

06:09.260 --> 06:12.580
Question is, you all-in or ain't ya?

06:14.065 --> 06:15.545
Hell yeah.

06:17.261 --> 06:18.260
Yeah.

06:18.263 --> 06:20.259
We'll see.

06:20.260 --> 06:22.139
So, it's not like when
you were a sales rep.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.059
Everything is KAM now.

06:24.060 --> 06:26.699
Key Account Management?

06:26.700 --> 06:28.419
Look, a single formulary is worth more

06:28.420 --> 06:31.219
than dozens of individual
doctors writing scripts.

06:31.220 --> 06:33.979
It may take me a bit to get up to speed.

06:33.980 --> 06:37.299
Hey, listen, sometimes it
still comes down to charm.

06:37.300 --> 06:40.444
Like, just last week, I told a group
of formulary stakeholders a joke.

06:40.447 --> 06:42.019
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.259
You know how to hide a
$100 bill from a surgeon?

06:44.260 --> 06:45.859
You put it in the patient's chart.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.577
Oh. Okay.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.064
Right?

06:49.067 --> 06:50.261
- Because they never check it.
- Yeah, I know, I get it.

06:50.263 --> 06:51.101
- I get it.
- They just...

06:51.103 --> 06:52.939
Hey, Ricky.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.539
This is Patrick.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.059
Hey.

06:56.060 --> 06:58.106
Patrick and I were just
reviewing some key points

06:58.109 --> 06:59.508
from the sales conference.

06:59.511 --> 07:01.059
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.339
Good to meet you, sir.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.339
Uh, it's "Ricky."

07:03.340 --> 07:05.459
Sure thing. Ricky.

07:05.460 --> 07:06.739
I'm gonna get something to drink.

07:06.740 --> 07:08.093
You want anything, Patrick?

07:08.096 --> 07:10.015
No, sir... Ricky.

07:10.016 --> 07:12.495
I'm, uh... I'm good.

07:12.496 --> 07:16.135
Um, hey, so, let's assume that
you're part of my KAM team.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.775
Now, I'd task you with a whole
matrix of individual questions

07:19.776 --> 07:21.478
so that you can actually figure out

07:21.481 --> 07:23.297
- how to formulate it yourself.
- Sure you don't want something?

07:23.299 --> 07:26.615
- I'm good.
- Okay. I'm gonna get some.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.815
Are you okay?

07:29.816 --> 07:31.575
Why are you so made up?

07:31.578 --> 07:33.050
I have to look professional.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.133
For him?

07:34.136 --> 07:37.215
Ricky, this is business.
It's a whole new world.

07:37.216 --> 07:38.535
I have to catch up.

07:38.536 --> 07:41.055
Behave, please.

07:41.056 --> 07:42.335
Wh-What are you doing?

07:42.336 --> 07:43.535
I've, uh, got to go.

07:43.536 --> 07:44.695
No, no, no! Stay!

07:44.696 --> 07:46.255
Right, Ricky?

07:46.256 --> 07:47.775
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Stay for lunch.

07:47.776 --> 07:49.401
I'll throw a couple
T-bones on the grill.

07:49.404 --> 07:50.455
How do you like yours?

07:50.456 --> 07:52.775
Uh, I've got some
account research to do.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.535
But, um, I will see you
tomorrow at the office.

07:55.536 --> 07:56.455
- Yes.
- Okay?

07:56.456 --> 07:57.695
I will be there.

07:57.696 --> 07:59.015
- Okay.
- Early.

07:59.016 --> 08:00.215
Great meeting you, Ricky.

08:00.216 --> 08:01.616
Yeah.

08:08.576 --> 08:11.055
What am I gonna do with you?

08:11.056 --> 08:12.495
What?

08:12.496 --> 08:14.335
I have what?

08:14.336 --> 08:17.895
Varicoceles... a swelling
in the veins in the scrotum.

08:17.896 --> 08:20.547
The result is an elevation
in temperature of the testes.

08:22.096 --> 08:25.095
So, you're saying my balls are too hot?

08:25.096 --> 08:28.257
Doctor, can you please
explain what the problem is?

08:28.260 --> 08:29.209
Of course.

08:29.212 --> 08:31.455
Sperm are quite sensitive.

08:31.456 --> 08:33.495
Heat causes low motility.

08:33.496 --> 08:35.655
In other words, your sperm are weak.

08:35.655 --> 08:38.054
They can't swim strongly or at all.

08:38.056 --> 08:40.534
They die before they get to the egg.

08:40.535 --> 08:44.575
Just so we understand, h-how
did we get pregnant before?

08:44.576 --> 08:46.695
The chance of a single
sperm reaching the egg

08:46.696 --> 08:50.695
is not eliminated, but it
is significantly reduced.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.575
You could get pregnant
again, but it's unlikely.

08:53.576 --> 08:57.215
Well, what do we do... Short of IVF?

08:57.216 --> 09:01.295
Well, Joseph, you can take
steps to keep your testes cool...

09:01.296 --> 09:05.215
Avoid wearing tight underwear,
don't do any heavy exercise,

09:05.216 --> 09:07.815
stay out of extreme heat conditions.

09:07.816 --> 09:08.936
Done.

09:13.016 --> 09:14.418
There is a surgical option...

09:14.421 --> 09:15.181
No.

09:16.816 --> 09:19.295
It's... expensive.

09:19.296 --> 09:21.667
I believe your insurance covers it.

09:35.736 --> 09:38.815
This isn't necessarily bad news.

09:38.816 --> 09:42.455
He wants to cut on my
balls. How is that good news?

09:42.456 --> 09:45.616
We know what the problem
is now, and we can treat it.

09:48.236 --> 09:49.236
What?

09:51.856 --> 09:54.015
God must be laughing.

09:54.016 --> 09:58.175
I'm a SEAL, and my
sperm can't even swim.

10:01.496 --> 10:04.255
Joseph...

10:04.256 --> 10:07.252
Joseph, this is not about you or God.

10:07.255 --> 10:10.135
This is a simple medical issue.

10:10.136 --> 10:12.935
We'll discuss it with the surgeon.

10:12.936 --> 10:14.056
Yeah.

10:17.416 --> 10:18.575
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.

10:22.336 --> 10:24.895
Quitting...

10:24.896 --> 10:27.056
It's not an option.

10:35.536 --> 10:38.336
Navy SEAL, you killed
this man. Now you bury him.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.975
Maybe you bury her, too.

10:50.976 --> 10:52.525
She didn't have
anything to do with this.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.096
- Richard, you can't just...
- Na'omi.

10:54.099 --> 10:56.536
Your whore digs with you.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.500
Dig.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.192
Nice shooting, man.

11:12.195 --> 11:13.983
Did you see Buck's
face? It was priceless.

11:13.984 --> 11:15.343
He was not expecting that.

11:15.344 --> 11:17.983
Thanks, man.

11:17.984 --> 11:19.823
Look, I just wanted to say, uh...

11:19.824 --> 11:22.543
back on the ship, I
normally wouldn't suggest

11:22.544 --> 11:24.903
an explosive breach in those conditions,

11:24.904 --> 11:27.743
but we had the HVT, we
were taking heavy fire...

11:27.744 --> 11:28.943
Hey, do you surf?

11:28.944 --> 11:30.541
I boogie-board.

11:32.308 --> 11:35.971
Okay, well, it's the
same concept anyway, so...

11:35.972 --> 11:37.331
You see me here?

11:37.332 --> 11:40.011
I'm riding the wave, just floating.

11:40.012 --> 11:42.251
You, right now, you're here.

11:42.252 --> 11:45.131
You're in the soup.
You're scraping rocks.

11:45.132 --> 11:46.531
See, you're holding on to things,

11:46.532 --> 11:48.211
and whether it be the ship mission

11:48.212 --> 11:51.291
or your family or Buck's bull shit,

11:51.292 --> 11:53.891
they weigh you down.

11:53.892 --> 11:55.291
You were aggressive.

11:55.292 --> 11:56.491
Own it.

11:56.492 --> 11:58.292
Float up here with me, dude.

12:00.412 --> 12:01.971
Roger that.

12:04.452 --> 12:06.531
Yo!

12:06.532 --> 12:08.211
So, how'd he do?

12:08.212 --> 12:09.731
Getting there.

12:09.732 --> 12:11.091
Good.

12:11.092 --> 12:12.572
You gonna be a dad or what?

12:15.412 --> 12:17.851
Jesus, is anything private around here?

12:17.852 --> 12:20.651
Huh?

12:20.652 --> 12:22.531
Yeah?

12:22.532 --> 12:24.572
Yeah, I'll be right there.

12:26.252 --> 12:28.851
Derek Willis into the
game for Chuckie Jr.

12:28.852 --> 12:30.771
Off to a good start this year.

12:30.772 --> 12:33.131
Playing a lot and scoring
a lot the first two games...

12:33.132 --> 12:34.771
Fourth quarter, 2-point game.

12:34.772 --> 12:36.571
It is time for the Asr
prayer. Will you join?

12:36.572 --> 12:38.691
Sure.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.772
Akmal.

12:45.052 --> 12:48.251
What was it that made
you leave the Russians...

12:48.252 --> 12:50.451
Change sides?

12:50.452 --> 12:52.291
We raided Alkhan-Yurt.

12:52.292 --> 12:54.411
That was my village.

12:54.412 --> 12:58.211
When one or two men resisted,
they massacred everyone.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.531
My commanding officer
shot a 12-year-old girl.

13:00.532 --> 13:04.371
She was bleeding on the
ground but still alive.

13:04.372 --> 13:07.891
So he ordered me to kill her.

13:07.892 --> 13:11.371
I knew her. I knew her family.

13:11.372 --> 13:14.531
So I made a deal with Allah.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.891
If I end her suffering,

13:16.892 --> 13:18.972
I would serve Him for
the rest of my life.

13:28.572 --> 13:29.932
Yes.

13:34.092 --> 13:35.331
It's all arranged.

13:35.332 --> 13:37.131
The meeting with Boko Haram is a go.

13:37.132 --> 13:39.292
Come on. Let's pray, brother.

13:43.332 --> 13:45.052
What took you so long?

13:46.612 --> 13:48.931
Now is when you tell me why you're here.

13:48.932 --> 13:51.251
Just exercised my
First Amendment rights.

13:51.252 --> 13:53.171
You know... What you're fighting for.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.842
She handcuffed herself across
the front doors of her school,

13:55.845 --> 13:58.651
then assaulted the
officer who cut the cuffs.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.117
Was this a protest?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.531
Performance art.

14:01.532 --> 14:03.531
Her friend recorded the
whole thing on his cellphone.

14:03.532 --> 14:05.091
What, you wanted to get arrested?

14:05.092 --> 14:07.731
We're already prisoners in
a system that shuffles us

14:07.732 --> 14:10.051
from station to station,
like rats in a maze.

14:10.052 --> 14:11.851
School is no better than prison.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.972
See what we've been dealing with?

14:18.052 --> 14:20.011
So, why didn't you call your mom?

14:20.012 --> 14:22.171
Erica's still out of town...

14:22.172 --> 14:23.411
Yoga retreat.

14:23.412 --> 14:25.052
So where am I taking you?

14:26.812 --> 14:28.571
No. Not my place.

14:28.572 --> 14:31.731
You signed for me, Alex.
You're the responsible parent.

14:31.732 --> 14:34.251
Or I could stay with Brad.

14:34.252 --> 14:36.564
You know a hospital that has rape kits?

14:38.052 --> 14:39.851
Dharma, don't joke about that.

14:39.852 --> 14:41.251
Or what?

14:41.252 --> 14:42.692
You gonna take him out?

14:44.132 --> 14:47.171
Jesus. I'm just messing with you.

14:47.172 --> 14:50.691
Don't try to be a dad all of a sudden.

14:50.692 --> 14:52.851
So the Lord said,

14:52.852 --> 14:54.811
"I will wipe from the face of the Earth

14:54.812 --> 14:57.331
the human race I have created,

14:57.332 --> 15:01.731
and with them, the animals and birds

15:01.732 --> 15:04.051
and creatures that
move along the ground,

15:04.052 --> 15:06.251
for I regret that I have made them."

15:06.252 --> 15:10.411
But let's take a moment
to remember who was spared.

15:10.412 --> 15:15.691
Noah, the righteous man,
blameless among his people.

15:15.692 --> 15:19.252
God would allow his line to continue.

15:27.332 --> 15:30.131
Thank you. Take care.

15:30.132 --> 15:31.875
That was a powerful sermon, Pastor.

15:31.878 --> 15:33.331
I'm glad you thought so, Joe.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.331
So, God, He... He punished everyone

15:35.332 --> 15:37.131
for what some people did?

15:37.132 --> 15:40.491
Yes. Um, but I-it's
an important message.

15:40.492 --> 15:42.571
Sins have consequences.

15:42.572 --> 15:44.652
So it's, uh...

15:46.932 --> 15:50.771
It's possible that,
you know, God would...

15:50.772 --> 15:52.971
punish a child...

15:52.972 --> 15:54.411
you know, for what her father...

15:54.412 --> 15:55.932
F-For what her father...?

15:55.933 --> 15:57.451
If... if, uh...

15:57.452 --> 16:01.451
If a father committed
a big enough sin, uh...

16:01.452 --> 16:04.622
Your service was
excellent, Pastor, as usual.

16:04.625 --> 16:05.624
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:07.052 --> 16:09.722
Uh, uh, we better... We better go.

16:09.725 --> 16:11.444
Well, we'll see you next Sunday.

16:11.447 --> 16:12.807
Absolutely.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.155
It's Command.

16:16.156 --> 16:17.155
Mm-hmm.

16:17.156 --> 16:18.795
So, uh...

16:18.796 --> 16:20.796
it could be about Rip, so...

16:24.716 --> 16:26.955
I love you.

16:26.956 --> 16:28.596
I love you, too.

16:33.436 --> 16:35.916
We need to talk, Joseph.

16:39.357 --> 16:41.316
I know.

16:47.356 --> 16:49.195
You better go.

16:49.196 --> 16:50.636
All right.

16:56.996 --> 16:59.435
Employees at a refinery
in our search sector

16:59.436 --> 17:02.635
confirmed suspicious Boko
Haram activity nearby.

17:02.636 --> 17:05.915
Through an Agency asset, we
identified an abandoned village

17:05.915 --> 17:08.954
which we believe may be where
the hostages are being held.

17:08.955 --> 17:11.234
Here's a live feed from ISR.

17:11.236 --> 17:13.353
As you can see, the tree
canopy is pretty thick.

17:13.356 --> 17:15.435
Can the asset positively identify?

17:15.435 --> 17:18.115
He would've risked tipping
off BH if he got too close.

17:18.116 --> 17:19.835
Command agrees it's enough to warrant

17:19.836 --> 17:21.474
forward staging to the area.

17:21.476 --> 17:24.474
A safe house 10 klicks from
the target, and the Agency

17:24.476 --> 17:27.075
will arrange ground
transportation to the ORP.

17:27.076 --> 17:29.315
It's too dense for vertical insertion.

17:29.316 --> 17:32.675
And it could endanger the
hostages if they heard you coming.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.756
Wheels up, three hours.

17:41.076 --> 17:44.756
Navy SEAL, how many people you kill?

17:46.556 --> 17:48.995
I kill seven.

17:48.996 --> 17:50.995
Why?

17:50.996 --> 17:53.475
Because they were my enemy.

17:53.476 --> 17:56.115
And when you kill somebody,
you take their spirit.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.955
Claim it by its secret name.

17:58.956 --> 18:01.755
The more you kill, stronger you become.

18:01.756 --> 18:03.355
You've never killed anybody.

18:08.479 --> 18:09.638
I kill seven.

18:17.316 --> 18:18.836
Put him in.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.955
You will not silence us.

18:38.956 --> 18:41.316
You will never silence us!

18:53.156 --> 18:57.155
Terry McAlwain, your
company refuses to pay.

18:57.156 --> 19:00.077
All this money for oil and none for you.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.472
Hmm.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.995
Just let him go. You don't need him.

19:03.996 --> 19:06.475
He's been through
enough. You just need me.

19:06.476 --> 19:09.595
Yes. He's been through enough.

19:09.596 --> 19:11.035
And now he is worthless.

19:11.036 --> 19:13.555
Felix.

19:13.556 --> 19:14.715
Kill him.

19:21.796 --> 19:22.796
Kill him now.

19:24.236 --> 19:25.962
Felix, don't.

19:26.876 --> 19:29.555
Don't do it.

19:29.556 --> 19:32.155
Look at him.

19:32.156 --> 19:33.635
You'll remember that face every day

19:33.636 --> 19:34.755
for the rest of your life.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.315
I promise you. It's not...

19:37.316 --> 19:40.875
Felix, it's not what you think it is.

19:40.876 --> 19:42.836
Trust me.

20:04.182 --> 20:06.102
It needs another nail.

20:08.528 --> 20:11.567
Mighty American SEAL.

20:11.568 --> 20:14.127
Well, look at you.

20:14.128 --> 20:16.887
Now you know who has the power.

20:18.368 --> 20:20.447
The infidels cannot protect you.

20:20.448 --> 20:22.047
America cannot protect you.

20:22.048 --> 20:24.327
This God cannot protect you.

20:24.328 --> 20:26.648
Tell me... Who can protect you?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.726
- Say it!
- Leave her alone!

20:30.729 --> 20:33.287
Who can protect you?!

20:33.288 --> 20:34.848
You.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.888
Stop it!

21:14.008 --> 21:16.007
Ohh!

21:37.050 --> 21:40.050
How do you like your Messiah now?

21:55.777 --> 21:58.285
_

22:12.488 --> 22:14.887
The girl in your village...

22:14.888 --> 22:16.527
What was her name?

22:16.528 --> 22:18.127
Layla.

22:18.522 --> 22:20.527
Layla.

22:20.528 --> 22:23.008
And did you avenge her?

22:27.088 --> 22:29.727
I castrated my commanding officer,

22:29.728 --> 22:31.687
slit his throat,

22:31.688 --> 22:34.127
and left for the mountains.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.087
I ordered tea.

22:45.088 --> 22:47.597
The price is $10 million.

22:54.088 --> 22:56.727
Indige vehicle takes us to the ORP here.

22:56.728 --> 22:59.008
- Please tell me it's not a garbage truck.
- Cargo.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.371
There's a local driver up front,

23:01.374 --> 23:03.429
one of our Agency
handlers riding shotgun.

23:03.432 --> 23:06.431
Okay. All right. At midnight,
we patrol in the rest of the way.

23:06.432 --> 23:08.111
It's about 3 klicks to the target.

23:08.112 --> 23:10.351
This is how the village
looked before it was abandoned,

23:10.352 --> 23:12.311
when it was still housing
for the refinery workers.

23:12.312 --> 23:14.511
Now, assuming not much has changed,

23:14.512 --> 23:16.991
this here... This is our primary target.

23:16.992 --> 23:19.311
Delta Team will search counterclockwise

23:19.312 --> 23:21.271
until the compound is secure.

23:21.272 --> 23:23.232
The hostages should be there.

23:27.712 --> 23:29.391
How's the knee?

23:29.392 --> 23:30.591
It's fine.

23:30.592 --> 23:32.831
What's up?

23:32.832 --> 23:35.631
You know this is some
heavy shit for Bear.

23:35.632 --> 23:37.791
This is some heavy shit for all of us.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.672
We're talking about Rip here.

23:39.675 --> 23:42.511
That's what I mean. You think
he's got his head screwed on right?

23:42.512 --> 23:45.231
Well, if you think Bear's
not gonna do the right thing,

23:45.232 --> 23:47.231
maybe you shouldn't be here, brother.

23:47.232 --> 23:48.831
Rip is my team leader, too.

23:48.832 --> 23:50.991
I want to get him back
just as badly as you do.

23:50.992 --> 23:52.682
Let's go get him.

24:17.073 --> 24:21.369
_

24:36.312 --> 24:38.751
I understand your desire

24:38.752 --> 24:40.951
to maximize the purchase
price, my friend,

24:40.952 --> 24:44.711
but your organization
swore allegiance to mine.

24:44.712 --> 24:48.791
And we had an agreement... $5 million.

24:48.792 --> 24:50.671
10.

24:50.672 --> 24:53.551
You proclaim to follow the Quran.

24:53.552 --> 24:56.071
It says we do not outbid each other

24:56.072 --> 24:58.631
or turn on each other
or outsell each other.

24:58.632 --> 25:00.511
We are servants of Allah as brothers,

25:00.512 --> 25:02.198
and we should act like it.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.718
The Quran? Allah?

25:04.721 --> 25:06.320
What do they have to do with this, huh?

25:06.323 --> 25:07.803
This is business.

25:10.564 --> 25:13.323
I will agree to your price...

25:13.324 --> 25:15.363
if I see the SEAL first.

25:15.364 --> 25:16.563
Impossible.

25:16.564 --> 25:18.283
Nothing is impossible.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.964
I see the SEAL, or no deal.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.083
No calls.

25:27.084 --> 25:28.844
The Americans will pick it up.

25:32.646 --> 25:33.926
Take me to him.

All right, boys.

26:55.960 --> 26:58.199
Hope everybody's got
extra rounds for me.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.759
I love you, Caulder.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.359
You put my anal-retentive
mama to shame.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.199
You're welcome.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.210
I swear, Buddha, nobody can
pack a car, a burrito, or a bag

27:06.213 --> 27:07.119
like your people.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.359
It's our proud national tradition, man.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.319
You have got to be kidding me.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.279
Look, it's in here. Give me a second.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.661
Bang! We're all dead.

27:16.664 --> 27:18.463
Fishbait, will you
please explain to Chase

27:18.464 --> 27:20.543
why everybody carries extra
rounds for yours truly?

27:20.544 --> 27:22.383
Heavy weapon. Eats up a lot of ammo.

27:22.384 --> 27:24.743
Yeah, so we need to carry extra. I know.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.143
If you knew, you would have them ready

27:26.144 --> 27:27.583
at a moment's notice
for you and I to grab.

27:27.584 --> 27:29.131
While you're digging
through your picnic basket,

27:29.133 --> 27:30.743
everybody's wondering where
the hell the cover fire is.

27:30.744 --> 27:33.384
I got your rounds right
here, mother fakar.

27:37.024 --> 27:38.544
Good.

27:43.654 --> 27:45.023
He's testing you.

27:45.024 --> 27:46.023
Yeah, no shit.

27:46.024 --> 27:47.743
It's not about the rounds.

27:47.744 --> 27:50.063
It's about what's going on up here

27:50.064 --> 27:52.063
and whether you can handle it.

27:52.064 --> 27:55.383
You're in the pros now, kid.

27:55.384 --> 27:57.103
Oh, and some advice...

27:57.104 --> 27:59.543
Just fold it up and stick
it in your outside pouch.

27:59.544 --> 28:01.304
That's how we do it here.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.215
What is Harvard... like, Chase?

28:16.218 --> 28:17.304
Not bad.

28:17.307 --> 28:19.661
Speaks three to four languages,
does advanced calculus.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.383
Yeah, you're gonna have
to tell us what that's like

28:21.384 --> 28:22.623
over tea and biscuits.

28:22.624 --> 28:24.423
I make a damn fine Earl Grey.

28:24.424 --> 28:26.063
I'll bet you do.

28:26.064 --> 28:27.983
That's fancy tea, Fish, just
in case you're wondering.

28:27.984 --> 28:29.664
Tea, I know, brother. Comes with this.

29:22.464 --> 29:24.783
Good day, Officer.

29:24.784 --> 29:25.903
Where are you heading?

29:25.904 --> 29:27.863
Cocoa factory.

29:27.864 --> 29:30.183
You are aware there is a toll?

29:30.184 --> 29:31.983
No.

29:31.984 --> 29:34.143
But I can pay it. How much?

29:34.144 --> 29:35.744
How much do you have?

29:37.424 --> 29:38.984
Him too.

29:45.664 --> 29:48.463
American dollars?

29:48.464 --> 29:50.024
- Out!
- Huh?

29:55.864 --> 29:57.703
Officer, what is the problem?

29:57.704 --> 29:59.663
Show me what's in the back.

29:59.664 --> 30:00.640
Officer...

30:00.643 --> 30:02.181
Show me!

30:02.744 --> 30:05.383
Officer, I'm late for my delivery.

30:05.384 --> 30:06.904
You think I care?

30:09.384 --> 30:11.743
Go! Open the door.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.624
I said open it!

30:45.472 --> 30:47.552
The Emir didn't authorize $10 million.

30:47.555 --> 30:48.848
They don't know that.

30:51.952 --> 30:53.672
Why is our assault team following us?

30:55.072 --> 30:56.631
What are you doing, Michael?

30:56.632 --> 30:59.751
What you did with your
commanding officer...

30:59.752 --> 31:01.471
What needs to be done.

31:01.472 --> 31:02.791
The Emir...

31:02.792 --> 31:05.191
Let me worry about the Emir.

31:05.192 --> 31:08.151
I have his blessing.

31:08.152 --> 31:09.472
Are you with me?

31:11.472 --> 31:15.751
The answer is, "Yes, I'm with you."

31:15.752 --> 31:18.112
No turning back now.

31:23.432 --> 31:26.231
Delta, soft timeline
for infil is midnight.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.312
Let's be ready.

31:38.072 --> 31:40.751
Foxtrot Delta One,
this is Reaper Two-Two.

31:40.752 --> 31:43.351
Be advised... four-vehicle
package moving north

31:43.352 --> 31:44.991
on north/south dirt road.

31:44.992 --> 31:47.175
Appear to be heading
toward target compound.

31:48.952 --> 31:51.271
Wake up.

31:51.272 --> 31:52.552
Richard, wake up!

31:56.339 --> 31:58.191
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot
Delta One. Roger that.

31:58.194 --> 31:59.271
I see them.

31:59.272 --> 32:01.471
Stay with them until they
leave the target compound.

32:01.472 --> 32:02.632
Delta, bring it in.

32:06.432 --> 32:07.911
The girls.

32:07.912 --> 32:09.431
Safe.

32:11.472 --> 32:12.810
What is that?

32:14.792 --> 32:17.351
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta
One. Do you still have them?

32:17.352 --> 32:19.671
Negative. We lost them when
they reached the target area.

32:19.672 --> 32:20.911
Could be nothing.

32:20.912 --> 32:21.987
Or it could be a kill team

32:21.990 --> 32:23.551
coming in to take out the hostages.

32:23.552 --> 32:24.951
Reaper Two-Two, Foxtrot Delta One.

32:24.952 --> 32:26.711
Do you have radio
traffic over the target?

32:26.712 --> 32:28.871
Negative, Delta One.
They're quiet at this time.

32:28.872 --> 32:30.831
Bear, we got to go in,
or they may be gone.

32:30.832 --> 32:32.311
We'd be going in blind.

32:32.314 --> 32:33.954
It's in the day...
Zero tactical advantage.

32:33.955 --> 32:36.592
This is what we came
for... Rip and those girls.

32:40.712 --> 32:42.431
Bear?

32:42.432 --> 32:44.271
Going in... now.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.751
Your new owners have arrived.

32:56.752 --> 32:58.952
You'll be leaving soon.

33:42.912 --> 33:44.952
We got to keep moving.

33:47.152 --> 33:49.152
Make the bastards pay for this.

34:42.911 --> 34:44.871
I got a dead Boko Haram.

34:44.871 --> 34:46.831
Roger. Keep moving.

34:51.312 --> 34:52.992
Got another one.

34:56.672 --> 34:58.295
What the hell?

36:08.374 --> 36:10.663
Foxtrot Delta One. We
are troops in contact.

36:10.664 --> 36:13.023
Delta, get to the huts.
Locate the hostages.

36:33.264 --> 36:34.504
Grenade!

37:02.464 --> 37:03.704
Aah!

37:35.104 --> 37:36.943
Blue! Blue!

37:36.944 --> 37:38.184
Blue!

37:58.144 --> 37:59.423
Buck!

37:59.424 --> 38:00.703
You out of ammo?

38:00.704 --> 38:01.944
I'm good.

38:10.557 --> 38:12.636
We got a man down behind
the southwest building.

38:12.639 --> 38:14.039
Take the SAW.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.064
No hostages!

38:47.264 --> 38:49.464
Hang in there, Buck. We got you, buddy.

38:53.744 --> 38:55.303
Hey. Look at me.

38:55.304 --> 38:57.543
Easy day.

38:57.544 --> 39:00.343
You see an exit wound?

39:00.344 --> 39:01.404
No, negative.

39:02.464 --> 39:04.383
This is Foxtrot Delta One.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.383
Target secure. We have a dry hole.

39:06.384 --> 39:08.783
The hostages must be
in that vehicle package.

39:08.784 --> 39:09.983
Commence SSE.

39:09.984 --> 39:11.063
How bad?

39:11.064 --> 39:12.823
Shot between the ribs,

39:12.824 --> 39:15.903
possible tension pneumothorax,
internal bleeding.

39:15.904 --> 39:17.223
He's urgent surgical.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.903
This is Delta One. Execute QRF.

39:21.904 --> 39:24.463
We need immediate CASEVAC.

39:24.464 --> 39:28.383
Single, Cat-One Alpha, urgent surgical.

39:41.302 --> 39:44.143
"The Lord saw how great the
wickedness of the human race

39:44.144 --> 39:46.903
had become on the Earth...

39:46.904 --> 39:49.423
and that every inclination of
the thoughts of the human heart

39:49.424 --> 39:51.624
was only evil all the time."

39:53.304 --> 39:55.223
"So the Lord said,

39:55.224 --> 39:57.303
'I will wipe from the face of the Earth

39:57.304 --> 40:00.263
the human race I have created...

40:00.264 --> 40:03.543
and with them, the animals,
the birds, and the creatures

40:03.544 --> 40:05.424
that move along the ground...'"

40:07.904 --> 40:10.584
"'...for I regret that
I have made them.'"
