NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.303 --> 00:06.795
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.973 --> 00:08.099
In New York City,

00:08.173 --> 00:11.109
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.177 --> 00:14.704
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.781 --> 00:16.476
These are their stories,

00:22.022 --> 00:24.081
You sure you won't come up?

00:24.157 --> 00:26.455
I've got an early session
tomorrow.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.051
And after Iast
night, I better get some rest.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.635
Good night.
Good night.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.988
OFFICER: Name's Cassie
Germaine, a cellist with
the Manhattan Symphony.

01:04.063 --> 01:07.591
Boyfriend dropped her off
after a date. Perp jumped
her as she came in.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.259
Tore her dress off.
Looks Iike he raped her.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.529
Any witnesses?
None.

01:10.603 --> 01:11.627
Who called it in?

01:11.704 --> 01:13.729
The alarm was triggered
when she didn't
key in the code.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.502
Where is she now?
Bedroom.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.872
Guy did a number on her.

01:19.646 --> 01:23.013
I blacked out. When I woke up,
my head was bleeding

01:23.083 --> 01:28.646
and he shredded my clothes
and cut my hair.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.020
Did he say anything?

01:31.758 --> 01:32.850
No.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.090
Mind if I show them?

01:39.165 --> 01:40.826
I got to get her
to the hospital.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.424
I'II ride along.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.099
I got something here.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.269
What's that?

01:55.348 --> 01:56.747
See the Iens?

01:57.684 --> 01:58.708
STABLER: That's a camera.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.810
It's a micro-mini.
Found it in the debris.

02:02.088 --> 02:03.578
Somebody watched
the whole thing?

02:03.656 --> 02:05.283
Still watching.

02:05.358 --> 02:09.852
See, it's wired into the Iamp.
Drawing juice off
the apartment electrical.

03:01.414 --> 03:02.506
Find any more cameras?

03:02.582 --> 03:03.742
Not yet.

03:04.050 --> 03:05.449
What's that gizmo?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.746
It's an RF scanner.

03:06.953 --> 03:10.252
Each camera transmits
on its own assigned frequency.

03:10.623 --> 03:13.751
I'm picking something up here.
Hold this for me.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.424
That's a good angle
for you, Morales.

03:24.237 --> 03:25.829
What have you got?

03:27.807 --> 03:29.536
Focused on the bed.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.678
I've got hangnails
bigger than this thing.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.337
FIN: Found another one.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.043
Bird's-eye view
of the toilet and shower.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.278
How many is that?

03:40.353 --> 03:43.151
Four so far.
One in the Iiving room,
two in the bedroom, and this.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.157
We've got ourselves
a high-tech peeping Tom.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.419
Where's he peeping from?

03:46.492 --> 03:48.790
Hard to say.
These cameras
use wireless transmitters.

03:48.861 --> 03:51.557
With no hard Iine to trace,
he could be next door
or on the next block.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.189
What kind of range
we talking about?

03:53.266 --> 03:55.996
150, 300 yards,
depending on signal strength.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.563
Well, that narrows our search
to a couple of thousand
apartments and offices.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.747
Excuse me. They told me
you were all set in here.

04:11.818 --> 04:12.978
I'm done.
Great.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.781
You're free to go.
Thanks.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.253
Thanks, Doc.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.880
You ready to go home?

04:18.958 --> 04:19.947
Yeah.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.956
My boyfriend grabbed
a few things for me to wear.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.926
You get the results
of the rape kit yet?

04:25.999 --> 04:28.160
The swabs were negative
for seminal fluid,

04:28.234 --> 04:31.761
no vaginal Iacerations,
but that's not unusual.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.296
So was I raped?

04:34.540 --> 04:36.701
Don't know that for sure yet.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.337
But the fact that he cut
your hair and your clothes,
wrote on your body,

04:40.413 --> 04:43.507
does tell us that it was
a sexually-motivated assault.

04:44.617 --> 04:49.418
Cassie,
can you think of anybody
that might want to hurt you?

04:50.056 --> 04:51.114
No.

04:51.190 --> 04:55.627
Do you remember anything?
A voice? A smell?
Color of his shoes?

04:55.962 --> 04:59.693
No. It all happened so fast.
I didn't see or hear anything.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.227
Who else has the keys
to your apartment?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.793
Nobody. Why?

05:06.506 --> 05:10.169
We found cameras
hidden in your Iiving room,

05:11.210 --> 05:13.303
your bedroom and your bath.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.640
Somebody's been watching me?

05:18.885 --> 05:20.216
How Iong?

05:20.286 --> 05:21.480
We're not sure yet.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.253
Is it the same guy
that attacked me?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.919
It could be. That's what
we're trying to find out.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.588
But I promise you,
we have swept
your entire apartment.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.632
We found all of the cameras...
Where's my boyfriend?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.635
He's outside.
He's waiting to take you home.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.696
I don't think
it'II ever be Iike home again.

05:41.541 --> 05:42.667
You go straight home?

05:42.742 --> 05:45.768
Wait a minute. You don't think
I did this, do you?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.938
Because whoever hid those
cameras was spying on me, too.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.973
Look. You know,
I'm just trying to get
a handle on what happened.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.412
How about friends
and co-workers?

05:53.486 --> 05:54.544
She mention
any problems with them?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.349
Yes. Only one.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.151
Robert Prescott,
our conductor.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.522
He's been after her
since she joined the symphony.

06:00.593 --> 06:01.855
And when was that?

06:01.928 --> 06:03.395
About six months ago.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.091
Cassie said she set him
straight, but I'm not so sure.

06:06.165 --> 06:07.189
Yeah? Why?

06:07.266 --> 06:09.530
Because Prescott has a hard
time taking no for an answer.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.536
You can ask Valerie Baxter.

06:11.604 --> 06:12.730
I will. Who is she?

06:12.805 --> 06:15.399
The violinist he was involved
with Iast season.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.534
Rumor is he was abusive.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.271
And what does this have to do
with Cassie?

06:19.345 --> 06:22.712
Because about a month
after Valerie Ieft,
Prescott hired Cassie

06:22.782 --> 06:25.649
and turned her into
his Iittle pet project.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.448
Even went so far as to set her
up in Valerie's old apartment.

06:28.521 --> 06:29.920
He set her up?

06:29.989 --> 06:31.786
The bastard owns the place.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.327
AII that rage
and he didn't rape her?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.760
Maybe he didn't
have the chance.

06:36.829 --> 06:40.458
Unis were there five minutes
after the security company
reported the alarm.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.761
How's the boyfriend Iook?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.893
Checked him out.
He was in a cab
during the attack.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.062
And the conductor?

06:45.138 --> 06:47.868
Well, according
to the building manager,

06:47.940 --> 06:50.636
Cassie's apartment is owned
by Maestro Productions,
Incorporated.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.109
AKA, Robert Prescott.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.373
And the previous tenant
was a violinist
he was involved with.

06:54.447 --> 06:57.007
She moved out
when the relationship
allegedly turned abusive.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.711
Think the cameras were there
when Cassie moved in?

06:59.786 --> 07:02.016
Prescott had ample opportunity
to plant them.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.680
Any history between
him and Cassie?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.986
Boyfriend says Prescott's
been chasing her for months.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.083
Maybe he got tired
of being a couch potato.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.028
Maybe he hired someone
to spice up his Iittle show.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.327
Either way, this guy meant
to humiliate her.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.630
He wrote "whore"
across her chest,
Iopped off all her hair.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.795
And took a fistful with him
to relive the moment.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.463
What did Prescott have to say?

07:20.540 --> 07:23.202
Nothing yet. Secretary
says that he ducked out
early this morning

07:23.276 --> 07:25.210
to Iook at investment
property upstate.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.267
How convenient.

07:26.345 --> 07:27.835
Won't be back
until Iate tonight.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.144
Well, where does a guy
get this video hardware?

07:30.216 --> 07:33.583
The Iab tracked
the serial numbers
to a shop on 35th and Third

07:33.653 --> 07:34.915
called Quark International.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.683
Everything for the novice spy
under one roof.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.988
Just Iocated his
ex-girlfriend, Valerie Baxter.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.391
New York School of Music.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.922
Talk to her. She might be
able to fill in some details
until Prescott gets back.

07:49.769 --> 07:53.637
He said I have a gift, but I
needed to Iearn discipline.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.833
So he took you under his wing.

07:55.908 --> 07:58.638
We'd work Iate together,
into the night.

07:58.711 --> 08:01.236
He'd drill me
until my fingers bled.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.941
Sounds demanding.

08:03.115 --> 08:06.050
He was. But it worked.

08:06.953 --> 08:10.753
I was feeling the music
on a deeper Ievel
than I ever thought possible.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.451
When did the relationship
turn sexual?

08:15.962 --> 08:19.921
About a month after we started
private sessions.

08:22.001 --> 08:26.961
He made me feel special,
that I could become
a concert violinist.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.430
We hear that he was abusive.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.443
Not until I told him
I wanted out.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.001
STABLER: What happened?

08:35.914 --> 08:41.945
One night, after he'd fallen
asleep, I went to the closet
for an extra blanket.

08:43.556 --> 08:49.392
I found a video camera
aimed through a hole
in the wall.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.330
The red Iight
was still blinking.

08:54.066 --> 08:57.934
On the shelf,
there was a row of tapes
with women's names.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.302
I was just another chapter
in his tape collection.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.839
So how did he react
when you ended it?

09:04.911 --> 09:06.970
He turned vicious.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.514
He berated me,
and threatened me.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.052
I couldn't pick up
my violin without shaking.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.516
We carry a full Iine
of surveillance
and security technology

09:18.591 --> 09:21.492
for the discerning
professional
and private citizen.

09:22.028 --> 09:25.156
Five hundred channels
and this is the crap
they put on?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.290
Guess where the camera is.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.065
I give up.

09:31.938 --> 09:36.272
CT 30-59.
It's got a half-inch CCD chip,
auto-iris Iens,

09:36.342 --> 09:39.641
and, with no front
element exposure,
it's virtually undetectable.

09:39.712 --> 09:40.770
What about this?

09:40.846 --> 09:44.247
A TRX-40 Iistening device
with digital recorder
and telephone interface.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.375
This stuff's Iegal?

09:45.451 --> 09:48.113
Absolutely. Since 9/11,
it's been flying off
the shelves.

09:48.187 --> 09:51.156
Into whose hot Iittle hands
did these gems fly?

09:51.223 --> 09:53.418
Three CT 30-10s,

09:55.061 --> 09:59.691
30-57
and a Spymaster-4 receiver.
That's some serious equipment.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.733
FIN: How serious?
Couple thou.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.098
MUNCH: Cash or credit?

10:03.169 --> 10:05.194
Good old American plastic.

10:05.304 --> 10:08.398
The equipment was ordered
online and charged to a credit
card issued Iast month

10:08.474 --> 10:10.840
to Mr. Herman Garfunkle
in Queens.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.640
Imagine our surprise
when the Iovely Mrs. Garfunkle
told us

10:13.713 --> 10:17.149
that her dearly departed died
three years ago
from a heart attack.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.581
Well, who took delivery?

10:18.651 --> 10:21.484
A PO box at U-Mail-It,
63rd and Broadway.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.715
Paid for with Garfunkle's
credit card.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.053
Within walking distance
to Cassie's apartment.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.025
And Prescott's penthouse,
two blocks from there.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.824
Within transmission range
of the cameras.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.897
We need to get inside
his penthouse.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.660
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.599
What about Valerie's
statement?

10:36.669 --> 10:38.500
He videotaped her
without her consent.

10:38.571 --> 10:42.371
It's not a crime if she
willingly engaged in those
activities while in his house.

10:42.441 --> 10:44.932
She didn't have a reasonable
expectation of privacy?

10:45.011 --> 10:48.708
The issue isn't
the government's intrusion
into our right to privacy,

10:48.781 --> 10:51.773
it's the right of a private
citizen to keep the government
out of his bedroom,

10:51.851 --> 10:53.751
and the courts still view that
as sacrosanct.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.548
We're not talking about
his bedroom.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.646
If he planted those cameras
in Cassie's apartment,

10:57.723 --> 10:58.985
it's as good as
breaking and entering.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.856
Not necessarily. He owns
the apartment.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.326
He has certain rights
to entry.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.763
AIex, we are talking about
a predator who's using
his position

11:06.832 --> 11:09.630
to extract sexual favors
and terrorize women.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.363
What if we found those cameras
in your bathroom?

11:11.437 --> 11:13.268
CRAGEN:
He may have taped the attack.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.206
We need a Iegitimate reason
to search his apartment.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.909
Okay. But you have to Iimit
the warrant to the receiver

11:20.980 --> 11:23.448
and any videos
or video equipment.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.425
EIIiot. Camera's aimed
right at the bed.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.193
Maestro's been very busy.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.167
Here's Valerie's performance.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.600
Cassie's peepshow
can be any one of those.

11:46.672 --> 11:47.696
When's Prescott due back?

11:47.773 --> 11:49.900
Secretary said tomorrow
morning.

11:49.975 --> 11:52.671
Looks Iike we have
a Iong night ahead of us.

11:53.979 --> 11:57.437
When Valerie said a row
of tapes, I had no idea
she meant three dozen.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.013
I've totally Iost count.
Where are we?

12:00.086 --> 12:02.816
Tape number nine.
No, number ten.

12:06.025 --> 12:09.426
He really seems to favor
that one position there.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.360
At Ieast he's consistent.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.625
"Boring" is the word
I think you're Iooking for.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.189
FIN: Wait till you see this.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.599
BENSON: What you got?
More romping around?

12:20.773 --> 12:22.741
STABLER:
Will you Iook at that?

12:24.410 --> 12:25.434
BENSON: It's Cassie.

12:25.511 --> 12:26.978
MUNCH: In the flesh.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.640
Time code says
this was recorded Iast month.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.206
Apparently, our victim's been
keeping a few secrets.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.581
Why didn't she tell us?

12:33.652 --> 12:34.778
Maybe she was embarrassed.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.287
FIN: Or afraid to.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.585
I guess the maestro
wants her to know who's boss.

12:38.657 --> 12:41.182
Let's just get them
both in here. Different times,
different rooms.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.455
Find out what the hell's
going on.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.800
BENSON: It's time to start
telling the truth, Cassie.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.531
I told you the truth. I don't
remember anything else.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.199
We're talking about
you and Prescott.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.441
We found a videotape
of you two.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.500
Where?

12:59.578 --> 13:00.875
In his bedroom.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.846
Why didn't you tell us?

13:03.115 --> 13:05.379
He threatened
to ruin my career.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.249
I think we need to start
at the beginning.

13:09.822 --> 13:14.088
I met Robert
about eight months ago
at the Casals Competition.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.920
When I won, he offered
to bring me to New York.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.431
Was sex part of the deal?

13:20.499 --> 13:21.488
No.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.900
He placed me with
the best instructors.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.996
He introduced me
to all the right people.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.174
He even set up my debut.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.939
Whenever I needed him,
he was there.

13:34.446 --> 13:38.177
I guess I fell in Iove.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.775
When did the relationship
turn sour?

13:41.887 --> 13:46.449
One night, I stopped by
his apartment to surprise him
with a birthday gift.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.893
He was in bed
with another woman.

13:51.130 --> 13:54.497
I told him it was over,
that I was quitting
the orchestra.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.296
Wasn't about to
Iet that happen.

13:56.368 --> 14:00.202
He said he'd
invested too much in me
and then he showed me the tape

14:00.272 --> 14:03.241
and threatened to show it to
all his friends in
the business if I didn't stay.

14:03.309 --> 14:06.938
I said I'd press charges
and he said, "Go ahead."

14:07.012 --> 14:08.274
It would be his word
against mine.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.644
How Iong ago was this?

14:09.715 --> 14:10.875
A Iittle over a month.

14:10.950 --> 14:11.974
Has he threatened you since?

14:12.051 --> 14:13.075
Not exactly.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.643
What exactly does
"not exactly" mean?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.518
I've been getting phone calls
and flowers.

14:19.892 --> 14:21.985
Yeah? What kind of flowers?
What's that?

14:22.061 --> 14:26.225
After every concert,
I come home and they're
waiting for me at my door.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.665
AII the card ever says is,
"AII my Iove, Me."

14:31.170 --> 14:32.364
And the phone calls?

14:32.438 --> 14:35.737
The minute
I walk into my apartment,
my phone starts ringing.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.003
When I answer, he hangs up.

14:38.077 --> 14:41.171
I thought it was Robert
trying to intimidate me.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.341
Cassie, how do you think
he knows when to call?

14:49.221 --> 14:51.746
He's watching me
with those cameras.

14:53.759 --> 14:57.126
I know he's cruel. I never
thought that he'd hurt me.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.860
Do you remember
the name of the florist?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.365
Farrelly's.

15:02.434 --> 15:03.696
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

15:06.572 --> 15:08.938
Prescott's here
with his Iawyer.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.206
Okay. We'II take him
in Interrogation.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.507
You and Munch,
can you give Cassie
a Iift back to rehearsal?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.069
No problem.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.215
That's quite
a video collection you've got,
Mr. Prescott.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.981
Private acts between
consenting adults.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.349
They consent
to being taped?

15:26.158 --> 15:27.182
Of course.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.454
STABLER: Not according to
Valerie Baxter.

15:29.895 --> 15:33.194
In case you hadn't noticed,
Valerie is a very fragile
young Iady.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.562
Thanks to you.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.693
Valerie had visions
of stardom.
I tried to help her.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.069
There was only
so much I could do
with the raw material.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.971
And you did it
every which way you could.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.600
Careful, Detective.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.976
I assure you, Detective,
a good time was had by all.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.439
BENSON: You having a good time
with Cassie Germaine?

15:50.516 --> 15:51.983
I'm enjoying working with her.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.281
She is a very talented
young Iady.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.843
Now, you own her apartment.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.981
It is a tax write-off for
my Ioan-out company.

15:59.058 --> 16:02.585
I rent it at a Ioss
to visiting musicians
and new hires.

16:02.661 --> 16:06.961
I also sublet apartments
on West 66th and 69th Street.

16:07.199 --> 16:08.757
You put cameras in them, too?

16:08.834 --> 16:11.894
STABLER: Not to mention
sending her flowers
and Iove notes.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.667
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.632
Where were you
night before Iast?

16:16.709 --> 16:19.200
Are you insinuating
that I had something to do
with her attack?

16:19.278 --> 16:20.302
Did you?

16:20.379 --> 16:24.475
I am producing her New York
debut this Friday.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.882
I am going to make
a big star of her.

16:26.952 --> 16:29.785
Why would I want to hurt her?

16:30.389 --> 16:32.118
Because she told you
to get Iost.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.819
And we all know how well
you handle rejection.

16:34.893 --> 16:38.021
You didn't answer
our question. Where were you?

16:38.097 --> 16:41.123
As a matter of fact,
I was with a young Iady.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.191
We need a name.

16:45.170 --> 16:50.802
Since you already
have the tapes,
you already have the answer.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.975
Her name is on the Iast tape.

16:54.046 --> 16:56.913
It's time-coded
and it's dated.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.581
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:00.819 --> 17:02.013
EIIiot?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.657
That guy's a piece of work.

17:10.729 --> 17:13.459
Munch and Fin called
from the concert hall.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.021
There's been another attack.

17:18.503 --> 17:21.996
Just walked in,
heard the scream
all the way from the Iobby.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.132
What had happened?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.368
They came back from a break,
found a message for Cassie.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.433
What kind of message?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.343
See for yourself.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.648
FIN: It was stuck between
the strings.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.151
Looks Iike
it's written in blood.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.147
BENSON: Whose blood?

17:44.363 --> 17:45.455
Where's Benson?

17:45.531 --> 17:47.624
She's staying with Cassie
until her friend shows.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.189
Anything on your flower man?

17:49.268 --> 17:51.031
Store clerk remembered
the guy.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.469
Said he never gave a name,
always paid cash.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.665
Description?

17:54.740 --> 17:58.574
White, medium height,
blond scraggly hair,
medium build.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.076
I set her up
with a sketch artist.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.705
I still say Prescott could
have hired somebody.

18:02.781 --> 18:03.907
No, I don't think so.

18:03.982 --> 18:06.109
The attacks were too personal
for a surrogate.

18:06.185 --> 18:09.018
The cards,
the flowers, the cello.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.214
These are intimate gestures.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.381
Unfortunately,
we've eliminated

18:11.457 --> 18:12.583
the only two men
she's been involved with.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.751
Maybe it's an erotomanic.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.955
He believes that
he's in a relationship
that doesn't exist.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.658
Sounds Iike me
and my four ex-wives.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.164
He might not even be
in the orchestra.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.667
She might not even know him.

18:23.735 --> 18:25.464
What flipped his switch?

18:25.537 --> 18:28.062
A Iook, a smile,
a casual hello.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.475
But to him, it's the beginning
of a beautiful Iove affair.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.534
Reminds me of a case
a few years back.
A guy thought this newscaster

18:33.612 --> 18:35.773
was sending him secret signals
through the television set.

18:35.848 --> 18:36.872
What happened?

18:36.949 --> 18:40.350
Well, he followed her home
one night, she told him
to get Iost, and he shot her.

18:40.419 --> 18:44.048
So, if our guy was Iooking in
while she made Iove
to her boyfriend...

18:44.123 --> 18:46.023
"Love, Me" turns to
"Die, Bitch."

18:46.091 --> 18:47.615
He might not stop
until he kills her.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.524
So where do we find
this straggly-haired freak?

18:49.595 --> 18:52.894
Probably somewhere near
the receiver that picked up
the video signal.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.865
Where are the tech guys
on the door-to-door?

18:54.933 --> 18:57.663
SIow-going without warrants.
They've got thousands
of square feet to cover.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.000
I'II ask the squad commander
to double the sweep teams.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.006
Meanwhile, what's the purchase
date on the equipment?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.042
Third of Iast month.
AII right.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.476
Focus on anybody in and out
of her apartment
between then and now.

19:07.546 --> 19:10.606
This guy had to be
in Cassie's apartment
to plant the cameras.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.411
I want to find out how.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.448
The entire building
got a security overhaul
in January,

19:18.524 --> 19:21.459
so each apartment's
got its own alarm
and security code,

19:21.527 --> 19:24.052
so nobody's getting in
without the tenant's
permission.

19:24.129 --> 19:25.756
What about maintenance?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.799
We always give prior
information about that,

19:27.866 --> 19:29.629
so that way,
if the tenant can't be home,

19:29.701 --> 19:32.033
then I stay in the apartment
until the work is done.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.594
Now, that's policy.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.505
Any visits
to Cassie Germaine's
apartment in the Iast month?

19:36.575 --> 19:40.773
Yeah. Here we go. 304.
The plumber unclogged
a kitchen drain.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.576
That was on Tuesday.
And there was a security tech

19:43.649 --> 19:46.413
that came up to her apartment
to check on
the new alarm system.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.577
That was on the 8th.

19:47.653 --> 19:48.881
How Iong was he up there for?

19:48.954 --> 19:50.819
An hour, I guess.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.314
You guess?

19:52.391 --> 19:55.121
Turns out I had
a Iittle problem
with the heating system in 102

19:55.194 --> 19:57.162
about the same time.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.491
So much for policy, huh?

19:58.564 --> 20:00.759
I can give you
the tech's name.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.823
It's right on the work order.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.368
Ray Campbell.

20:06.471 --> 20:09.702
Ever since 9/11,
it's been boom time
in the security business.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.710
Had to hire a slew
of new guys.
Some good, some not.

20:12.778 --> 20:15.508
Which is why we got to go back
and shake out the bugs
every now and again.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.048
How Iong has Ray
been with you?

20:17.115 --> 20:19.413
About 10 years.
He's one of my best men.

20:19.484 --> 20:23.386
Well, apparently, he made
a follow-up call to
Cassie Germaine's apartment.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.117
Do you know what the problem
was with her alarm system?

20:26.191 --> 20:27.658
I don't remember.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.057
But then again,
we've been so damn busy.

20:29.127 --> 20:30.219
Yeah.

20:32.831 --> 20:34.264
That's odd.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.261
Looks Iike the work order's
not in the system,

20:36.335 --> 20:39.168
and I have Ray
at another Iocation that day.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.637
Nearby?

20:40.706 --> 20:41.798
Next block.

20:42.207 --> 20:43.231
Where's Ray now?

20:43.308 --> 20:44.297
He's out on a job.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.344
I'd Iike to talk to him.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.244
Ray Campbell?
Yeah?

20:49.314 --> 20:50.975
Detective Stabler.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.042
What can I do for you?

20:53.118 --> 20:58.215
Well, the 8th of Iast month,
did you do a job
at 262 West 65th Street?

20:58.290 --> 20:59.882
I work a Iot of jobs
in that area.

20:59.958 --> 21:02.119
Well, how about this job?

21:04.096 --> 21:07.065
Yeah. No. I mean no.

21:07.132 --> 21:08.258
Which is it?

21:08.900 --> 21:11.198
Look, I installed a system
there a few months ago,

21:11.270 --> 21:12.828
but I ain't been
back there since.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.269
Is that your employee number?

21:14.339 --> 21:16.398
Yeah. But that is not
my signature.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.136
Well, whose is it?

21:18.777 --> 21:22.577
Well, maybe it's the same guy
who stole
the rest of my stuff.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.714
What stuff?

21:24.783 --> 21:27.445
About a month ago,
somebody broke into my truck.

21:27.519 --> 21:30.511
Took some tools, jacket, hat.

21:31.423 --> 21:33.550
I didn't even think
to check the paperwork.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.958
I mean, why the hell
would anybody
want that, right?

21:37.796 --> 21:40.424
He posed as a security tech
to gain access
to the buildings.

21:40.499 --> 21:43.491
Now, only three addresses
serviced by that company

21:43.568 --> 21:46.162
fall within the broadcast
range of the cameras.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.865
One of them
in Cassie's building.

21:47.939 --> 21:50.100
And a tech just finished
sweeping that.

21:50.175 --> 21:53.110
Which means the receiver
has to be in one of
the other two buildings.

21:53.178 --> 21:55.510
I got the managers to fax me
their work orders.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.810
Take a Iook at the signatures
on the bottom there.

21:57.883 --> 21:58.907
They don't match.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.215
One's a forgery.
Signature's the same
as the phony work order

22:02.287 --> 22:05.745
from Cassie's building,
and it includes a charge

22:05.824 --> 22:08.292
for an unauthorized DSL Iine
in the basement.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.385
He could send out
a video signal over that.

22:10.462 --> 22:11.554
Munch and Fin are with a tech.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.394
Have them get over
to that second building now.

22:18.203 --> 22:20.797
Why do we always get stuck
with the glamorous gigs?

22:20.872 --> 22:23.602
Because Cragen Iikes
our can-do attitude.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.902
Yeah. If I wanted to go
crawling through dark,
smelly places,

22:25.977 --> 22:27.842
I would have joined
the Department of Sanitation.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.642
Guys, over here.

22:29.715 --> 22:30.841
FIN: What's that?

22:30.916 --> 22:35.216
Looks Iike a
telephone junction box, and
that's probably a DSL Iine.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.085
MUNCH: Like what hooks
my computer up
to the World Wide Web.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.590
MORALES: Can you give me
a hand here, please?

22:42.127 --> 22:44.527
There's your receiver,
connected to a Iaptop,

22:44.596 --> 22:46.791
and those four outputs
correspond
to the four cameras.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.730
And what's that Iaptop for?

22:48.800 --> 22:50.427
It's probably running
a video-streaming program

22:50.502 --> 22:52.333
and transmitting
the pictures over this.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.964
FIN: To where?
Anywhere he can
plug in another computer.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.975
You mean
he's sending his video out
over the Internet?

22:58.043 --> 23:00.307
Welcome
to the information age.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.813
Turns out our perp's
hosting his own website.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.408
Picked up a video signal
using a receiver Iocated in
a building on the next block

23:06.485 --> 23:10.319
and then sent it out over
a DSL Iine charged
to the security company.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.822
How many hits to the website?

23:11.890 --> 23:14.552
According to
the Internet service provider,
a Iot of hits,

23:14.626 --> 23:16.184
but only one computer
doing the hitting.

23:16.261 --> 23:17.353
Whose is it?

23:17.429 --> 23:20.796
It's a guy named
Terry Willard. 23rd and Lex.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.361
Terry Willard?
New York City detectives.
Open up.

23:26.438 --> 23:28.633
He's not in any trouble,
is he?

23:28.707 --> 23:32.006
This is a warrant.
Could you open that door,
please?

23:42.454 --> 23:44.752
Would you stand to the side,
please?

23:45.056 --> 23:47.024
FIN: Any idea where Terry is?

23:47.125 --> 23:50.185
AIMEE: Probably at work.
What did he do?

23:50.796 --> 23:53.094
BENSON: It's just part
of the investigation.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.102
You got a key for this?

24:01.173 --> 24:02.197
No.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.804
Guys, check this out.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.953
Now that's devotion.

24:19.991 --> 24:22.255
He's almost finished
with another roll.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.761
More pics to add
to his collection.

24:25.096 --> 24:28.156
Indiana University, 1997.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.530
He's been stalking her
since then.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.126
FIN: Talk about your groupie
from hell.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.831
And Terry's her number
one fan.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.205
We'II bring the computer
back to the Iab

24:43.281 --> 24:45.647
and see what Morales
gets off the hard drive.

24:45.717 --> 24:48.049
Check the DVDs, too.
He might have recorded
the attack.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.246
Yeah. We'II clean up here.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.560
He's a good man.
Sweet, gentle.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.788
You seem to know him
pretty well.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.491
We've become quite close.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.065
How close?

25:02.133 --> 25:03.395
He's my boyfriend.

25:05.537 --> 25:06.697
Since when?

25:06.771 --> 25:07.760
Thanksgiving.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.964
Neither one of us
has family here,

25:10.041 --> 25:12.942
so I suggested we go to
a coffee shop on the corner.

25:13.311 --> 25:15.279
That was our first date.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.842
You ever been in that room?

25:17.916 --> 25:20.817
It's his office.
There was never any reason.

25:21.119 --> 25:23.713
He ever talk to you
about a friend of his
named Cassie?

25:23.788 --> 25:25.312
Maybe from college?

25:25.390 --> 25:28.291
He doesn't have many friends.
He's too busy with work.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.918
What kind of work does he do?

25:29.995 --> 25:32.520
He's a partner at an
Internet company in SoHo.

25:32.597 --> 25:35.623
It's really taking off,
which is why his hours
are so crazy.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.860
STABLER: What's the name
of the company?

25:36.935 --> 25:38.061
Webtrends.

25:38.136 --> 25:42.095
His office is in one of those
big, glass buildings
by the river.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.366
We Iaid Terry off
a couple of months ago.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.342
So he's not a partner?

25:46.411 --> 25:48.743
Hardly. Terry's not really
a people person.

25:48.813 --> 25:51.077
But he's
a hell of a website designer.

25:51.149 --> 25:52.480
So then why Iet him go?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.918
We had to dump 90%
of our people
when the stock tanked.

25:55.987 --> 26:00.390
A few months back, all these
cubicles were filled with
designers and support staff.

26:00.458 --> 26:03.018
Now we're flirting
with Chapter 11.

26:03.161 --> 26:05.629
Well, this was Terry's
workspace.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.889
He went ballistic
when we gave him the bad news.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.228
He have a temper?

26:09.301 --> 26:12.759
That's the thing.
He was so quiet,
you forget he was even here.

26:12.837 --> 26:15.533
The Iast few weeks
he seemed distracted.

26:15.607 --> 26:16.665
Yeah? Over what?

26:17.309 --> 26:18.776
Probably heard the rumors.

26:18.843 --> 26:21.744
We would have kept him on,
but his work habits
became so erratic.

26:21.813 --> 26:23.678
I mean, he Ieft us no choice.

26:23.748 --> 26:24.806
STABLER: Erratic? How?

26:24.883 --> 26:26.475
Missed days at a time.

26:26.551 --> 26:28.883
He'd come in all bleary-eyed
Iike he'd been up all night.

26:28.954 --> 26:32.151
I guess when the ax
finally dropped, he snapped.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.452
MORALES: These four images are
a composite from the hardware
in Terry's apartment.

26:37.529 --> 26:38.826
FIN: How'd he do it?

26:38.897 --> 26:41.297
He downloads the images
from all four cameras
into his computer,

26:41.366 --> 26:44.665
where he edits the video
and transfers it to a DVD.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.064
His director's cut.

26:46.137 --> 26:48.571
He's finished 20 days,
complete with music.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.870
Is this the day of the attack?

26:52.544 --> 26:55.377
Yeah. This is the morning,
still unedited.

26:55.513 --> 26:57.743
MUNCH: Fast-forward
to that night.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.784
That's where he blitzed her.

27:05.423 --> 27:08.119
MORALES: Door was shut.
Lost all the Iight.

27:08.426 --> 27:11.486
Sorry. You might be
interested in this, though.

27:14.699 --> 27:16.894
"The Legend of
Cassie and Terry."

27:16.968 --> 27:20.734
An online journal.
Love story begins
four years ago at Indiana U.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.329
Hears her playing the cello.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.238
Must have struck a chord.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.209
Follows her to competitions
all over the world,

27:26.277 --> 27:28.711
but the story takes a sad turn
when Terry goes to prison.

27:28.780 --> 27:29.804
For what?

27:29.881 --> 27:33.044
Credit card fraud
to pay for the trips.
Does a seven-month stretch.

27:33.118 --> 27:36.383
But by the time he gets out,
Cassie's graduated
and moved away.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.945
So he contacts
an online search engine,

27:39.024 --> 27:41.219
buys her social security
number for 45 bucks,

27:41.292 --> 27:43.556
and uses it to trace her
work address to the Symphony.

27:43.628 --> 27:46.324
FIN: Any fool can do it.
AII you need is a computer
and an Internet hook-up.

27:46.398 --> 27:49.333
Yeah, but is there anything
in this journal
that ties him to the attack?

27:49.401 --> 27:51.767
Nothing that
makes him the doer.
No Ieads on his whereabouts.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.827
Girlfriend hasn't
heard from him for two days,

27:53.905 --> 27:55.202
so he knows
we Iike him for this.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.900
MUNCH: Lucky he's
still in town.

27:56.975 --> 27:58.704
And we know that how?

27:58.777 --> 28:01.905
He has a half-dozen
online accounts,
all under fictitious names.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.312
Uses public computers
in coffee shops

28:04.382 --> 28:07.647
and bookstores up and down
Broadway to visit his sites.

28:07.719 --> 28:10.244
We told Morales
to keep the sites
and the credit card active

28:10.321 --> 28:12.289
so we could track
his movement.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.622
If he ever stays online
Iong enough, the service
provider can trace the hit.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.252
And if he doesn't?

28:17.328 --> 28:19.057
Well, he's under our radar.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.995
Unless we can flush him out.

28:21.066 --> 28:24.866
Tell Benson and Stabler
to bring in Cassie
for a Iittle chat.

28:26.337 --> 28:27.998
CASSIE: That's him?

28:28.073 --> 28:29.370
It's a four-year-old mug shot.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.033
His appearance
may have changed.

28:31.109 --> 28:33.669
He followed you here
from college.

28:33.745 --> 28:36.043
Why?
BENSON:
He's obsessed with you.

28:36.114 --> 28:39.379
But I don't know him.
I've never seen him before.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.180
HUANG: He thinks he knows you.

28:41.252 --> 28:44.983
He's concocted a whole story
in his head about your
having a Iove affair.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.514
The cameras were a way of
furthering that delusion
without risking rejection.

28:48.593 --> 28:49.685
How do you know?

28:49.761 --> 28:52.229
He kept a journal
with intimate details

28:52.297 --> 28:53.992
of a four-year relationship
between you two.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.465
How can he be jealous
when I've never met him?

28:56.534 --> 28:58.331
That's part of his sickness.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.564
He believes that
the two of you are in Iove.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.765
Well, isn't there any way
to stop him?

29:02.841 --> 29:06.242
We think so, but we're going
to need your help.

29:06.311 --> 29:09.474
Now, Terry visits a website
he dedicated to you

29:09.547 --> 29:12.038
twice, sometimes
three times a day.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.509
Well, what would I have to do?

29:14.586 --> 29:18.716
We'd Iike you to include
a message to him
in your press interviews.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.489
Dedicate the performance
to him.

29:20.558 --> 29:23.356
Tell him it's your way
of Ietting him know
how much he means to you.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.020
But this guy is crazy.

29:25.096 --> 29:29.192
We'II cover every entrance,
we'II grab him before
he ever gets close to you.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.929
You haven't caught him yet.
Why should I trust you now?

29:32.003 --> 29:35.905
Cassie, this is our best
chance of getting him
into a controlled situation

29:35.974 --> 29:37.134
on our terms.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.802
But we can't do it
unless you agree.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.203
MORALES:
We've got a camera positioned

30:09.274 --> 30:11.469
at each entrance
to the auditorium.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.011
They're hooked up
to the facial recognition
software,

30:14.078 --> 30:16.103
which is Ioaded into
this computer.

30:16.181 --> 30:17.944
I didn't know
we could afford this stuff.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.143
Well, as each person passes
through the choke point,

30:20.218 --> 30:22.379
the camera takes a series
of still shots of their face.

30:22.453 --> 30:26.514
The software scans that face,
and compares it to
known felons in a data bank.

30:26.591 --> 30:29.856
Could be a busy night.
These theater folks
are a motley crew.

30:29.928 --> 30:33.056
Well, for today, I've entered
only one face into the bank.
Terry Willard.

30:33.131 --> 30:34.564
CRAGEN:
What if he's disguised?

30:34.632 --> 30:36.156
Well, we've Iowered
the recognition threshold

30:36.234 --> 30:39.203
to allow for differences
between his mug shot
and his current appearance,

30:39.270 --> 30:43.172
including changes
in facial hair, glasses,
weight Ioss and gain.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.869
Technology's answer
to racial profiling.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.969
And Big Brother's new toy.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.180
(BEEPING)

30:52.250 --> 30:54.241
What do you got?
A hit.

30:54.319 --> 30:58.619
Aisle two. The man
in the beard, behind the woman
in the red dress.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.256
Sir, come with us, please.

31:04.729 --> 31:07.493
MORALES: Hold on. We've got
another hit. Aisle four.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.192
MUNCH: How many Terry Willards
are out there?

31:09.267 --> 31:11.428
There might be a few.
I set a Iow threshold.

31:11.502 --> 31:14.130
Go ahead.
I'II wait for the next one.

31:17.942 --> 31:19.739
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

31:24.616 --> 31:26.015
I can't do this.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.381
We're checking everyone.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.283
If he's here,
we're going to get him.

31:29.354 --> 31:31.754
Don't worry. Just think
about the music, okay?

31:31.823 --> 31:34.053
I'II be in the front row.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.023
You're going to be great.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.700
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

31:53.978 --> 31:56.105
Sorry for the inconvenience.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.543
False alarm.
Same here.

31:59.617 --> 32:01.414
So much for Big Brother.

32:01.486 --> 32:04.011
Detectives. Found these
outside the dressing room.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.579
They're addressed
to Miss Germaine.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.455
(CELLO PLAYING)

32:08.526 --> 32:10.050
FIN: What you got?

32:10.128 --> 32:11.459
STABLER: A dead rat.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.895
How the hell
did he get in here?

32:14.332 --> 32:15.856
Go ahead.

32:17.268 --> 32:20.032
Where? AII right, we got it.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.093
What?

32:21.172 --> 32:22.161
Another hit.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.587
Excuse me, sir.
I want you to come with me.

32:37.655 --> 32:39.282
No.
Sir, I want you
to come with me.

32:39.357 --> 32:40.449
No.
Sir.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.726
Leave me alone.
She invited me.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.456
Cassie invited me.

32:48.232 --> 32:50.132
There's no one Iike Cassie.

32:50.201 --> 32:52.465
Now, you guys don't seem
to run in the same circles.

32:52.537 --> 32:53.834
How did you meet?

32:53.905 --> 32:56.203
I was taking a shortcut
through the school of music

32:56.274 --> 32:58.174
when I heard someone playing.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.704
The cello?

32:59.844 --> 33:03.211
I moved to the open door
and I saw her, alone,
on stage.

33:03.281 --> 33:05.272
I stood there Iistening,
and when she finished,

33:05.350 --> 33:09.047
she Iooked up and saw me,
and then she smiled.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.144
Connected.

33:10.221 --> 33:13.190
From then on,
I knew we'd be together
for the rest of our Iives.

33:13.257 --> 33:15.157
But it hasn't always
been easy.

33:15.226 --> 33:18.923
I mean, the traveling,
prison, the dead-end jobs.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.022
You've sacrificed a Iot
to be with her.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.567
Not a sacrifice
if you care about somebody.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.864
Well, what he means,
it must have cut awfully deep

33:25.937 --> 33:28.405
to watch her making Iove
to another man.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.302
It wasn't her fault.

33:30.908 --> 33:32.466
How do you figure that?

33:32.543 --> 33:34.704
He got her drunk
and took advantage of her.

33:34.779 --> 33:37.077
Come on, Terry.
I know you Iove her,
but you're not an idiot.

33:37.148 --> 33:39.241
She knew you were watching
and she Iaughed in your face.

33:39.317 --> 33:40.784
No. It wasn't Iike that.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.446
He makes those sacrifices,
she treats him Iike
he's yesterday's trash.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.682
I'd want to slap
the hell out of her, too!

33:45.757 --> 33:47.588
I'd never hurt Cassie.

33:47.658 --> 33:51.651
I Iove her. It was horrible,
the way he beat her.

33:57.001 --> 33:58.935
How did you know
she was beaten?

34:00.004 --> 34:01.028
I saw it.

34:01.105 --> 34:04.472
With the cameras you put
in her bedroom to spy on her?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.013
I found her website
on the Internet.

34:09.080 --> 34:13.176
You were just surfing the web
and you happened
to come across her website?

34:13.251 --> 34:14.275
I don't think so.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.252
Terry, we know about
your Iittle scam
with the credit cards.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.150
We know you bought
the cameras.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.190
What about the cello? The rat?

34:25.096 --> 34:26.563
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:26.630 --> 34:28.496
Why are you running, Terry?

34:28.565 --> 34:31.126
Aimee said you were
trying to put me in jail
for something I didn't do.

34:31.202 --> 34:33.397
Aimee, your other girlfriend?

34:34.938 --> 34:37.772
She's not my girlfriend.
She's my Iandlady.

34:37.875 --> 34:38.899
CRAGEN:
That's not what she said.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.000
Then she's Iying.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.636
Well, you know something,
Terry? I think you're Iying.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.440
You're playing her 'cause
you can't pay your rent,

34:43.514 --> 34:45.311
and you're playing us because
you think we're stupid.

34:45.382 --> 34:46.407
No!

34:46.484 --> 34:48.884
Hey, we can't help you
unless you help yourself!

34:48.953 --> 34:53.150
Tell us the truth, and maybe
I can convince the D.A.
to go easy on you.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.692
If not, it's out of our hands.

34:57.228 --> 35:01.824
I've already told you
the truth. I'd never hurt her.

35:04.569 --> 35:05.729
Never.

35:07.572 --> 35:10.336
We don't have any evidence
tying him to the assault
or the vandalism.

35:10.408 --> 35:11.875
No forensics. No witnesses.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.240
What about the cameras?

35:13.311 --> 35:14.903
He used a phony
credit card to buy them.

35:14.979 --> 35:17.607
We still can't prove
it was Terry who used
the card to make the purchase.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.843
His fingerprints
were in Cassie's apartment.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.384
AII right. Trespassing.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.545
Counselor, he stalked her.

35:23.821 --> 35:26.187
Stalking requires proof
he tried to frighten her.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.657
AII of our evidence shows
he tried to remain hidden.

35:28.726 --> 35:31.820
In fact, Cassie hadn't even
seen him until you arrested
Terry at the concert.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.796
Well, what about
that case in Jersey?

35:33.865 --> 35:37.028
Landlord got 30 years
for planting cameras
in a tenant's apartment.

35:37.101 --> 35:38.693
He transmitted sound.

35:38.769 --> 35:40.794
That elevated the charges
to wiretapping.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.999
Terry did not record
or transmit sound.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.063
So where does that Ieave us?

35:44.175 --> 35:46.700
Since you found the clothing
from the security company
in his apartment,

35:46.777 --> 35:49.211
I can try and up the ante
to burglary of the van.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.577
That it?

35:50.648 --> 35:54.744
Till the Iaw catches up with
the technology, I'm afraid
that's all I can do.

35:56.954 --> 35:59.388
At Ieast we pulled the plug
out of Terry's
Iittle operation.

35:59.457 --> 36:02.984
I read somewhere that once
an image gets on the Internet,
it can never be destroyed.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.255
A hell of a way to achieve
immortality.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.958
I just got a call from Cabot.
Aimee posted Terry's bail.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.661
He's in jail for planting
cameras in another woman's
apartment

36:11.736 --> 36:13.260
and she comes to his rescue?

36:13.337 --> 36:14.668
How blind can Iove be?

36:14.739 --> 36:17.105
I'm going to get
a uni on Cassie.
I don't trust this guy.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.836
CRAGEN: Too Iate.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.242
Cassie Germaine's been shot.

36:25.883 --> 36:29.182
WOMAN ON PA: Dr, Thomas,
call the pharmacy, Dr, Thomas,
please call the pharmacy,

36:29.253 --> 36:31.016
How's she doing?

36:31.088 --> 36:32.715
Still in surgery.
What happened?

36:32.790 --> 36:36.851
She came by to pick me up
on the way to work, and I'd
forgotten my wallet inside

36:36.928 --> 36:39.260
and I'd just opened my door
and I heard shots

36:39.330 --> 36:41.264
and I ran back out there
and I found her Iying there.

36:41.332 --> 36:42.560
Kevin Wilson?

36:42.633 --> 36:43.725
Yes.

36:43.801 --> 36:45.860
Hi. I'm Dr. Barrett,
Cassie's surgeon.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.165
Is she going to be okay?

36:47.238 --> 36:48.865
It Iooks good.
She was very Iucky.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.498
Can we speak with you
one second, Doc?

36:50.575 --> 36:53.669
Sure.
Hold on. So fill us in.

36:53.744 --> 36:56.076
Two slugs to the back.
One hit the Ieft kidney,

36:56.147 --> 36:57.444
the other barely
missed her heart.

36:57.515 --> 36:59.642
Excuse me.
Any idea what caliber?

36:59.717 --> 37:04.086
Small. Maybe a.22.
And, given the stippling,
I'd say it was close range.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.452
When do you think
we can talk to her?

37:05.523 --> 37:07.218
Soon as she's out of recovery.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.383
Okay.

37:09.327 --> 37:12.785
That was Munch.
Internet service provider
got a hit on Terry's website.

37:12.863 --> 37:15.832
Where?
Internet cafe
two blocks from here.

37:16.033 --> 37:17.660
Okay. Why don't you go ahead?

37:17.735 --> 37:19.703
I'II stay with Cassie,
see if she can make an ID.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.139
He's still online.

37:28.212 --> 37:29.907
AII right. Well, Iet's go.

37:47.331 --> 37:48.457
John.

37:58.809 --> 38:00.106
Enjoying the show?

38:00.177 --> 38:01.906
I'm not doing anything here.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.971
Aren't you a Iittle young
to be watching that?

38:05.049 --> 38:06.573
A guy was sitting here, okay?

38:06.651 --> 38:08.175
He Ieft his computer on,
so I decided to check it out.

38:08.252 --> 38:09.776
What guy?

38:10.321 --> 38:13.222
He had scraggly hair.
He was sort of wigged out.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.886
He was blubbering about
some chick Ieft him over
another man or something.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.054
Is this the guy?
Yeah.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.290
Where'd he go?

38:20.364 --> 38:22.127
Took off about 10 minutes ago.

38:22.199 --> 38:24.394
CIerk says our guy Ieft this.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.292
Aimee SIocum.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.667
Either she's the dumbest woman
in the world,

38:27.738 --> 38:29.296
or he's a Iot slicker
than he Iooks.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.603
STABLER: Don't you have
some homework to do?

38:32.276 --> 38:33.868
He can't get far without cash.

38:33.944 --> 38:35.002
Unless someone's helping him.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.944
Aimee.
She keeps bailing him out.

38:37.014 --> 38:38.140
Why don't you sit on her?

38:38.215 --> 38:42.015
I'II hook up with OIivia,
see if she got anywhere
with Cassie.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.314
MUNCH: Aimee?

38:45.423 --> 38:47.152
I'm in kind of a hurry.

38:47.224 --> 38:49.385
I'm making dinner
for a friend in Brooklyn.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.586
Want us to give you a Iift?

38:50.661 --> 38:51.923
I have a cab waiting.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.623
We're Iooking for Terry.

38:53.698 --> 38:56.531
He hasn't been home
since he got out of jail.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.329
How did he get this?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.497
Where did you find that?

39:00.571 --> 39:03.540
At an Internet cafe
where he was visiting
his favorite website.

39:03.607 --> 39:05.632
You know,
Cassie's Greatest Hits.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.644
There must be
some kind of mistake.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.112
Someone shot Cassie
this morning.

39:10.581 --> 39:14.017
Not Terry.
He's the gentlest man I know.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.576
We just want to make sure
he doesn't hurt you.

39:16.654 --> 39:18.019
You've got him all wrong,
Detective.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.920
If you hear from him,
you'II Iet us know, right?

39:19.990 --> 39:23.153
I will. Now if you'II
excuse me, I'm Iate.

39:25.129 --> 39:27.188
Do you believe
that song and dance
about a friend in Brooklyn?

39:27.264 --> 39:28.754
Hell, no.
Let's tail her.

39:30.701 --> 39:36.469
I was waiting in the garage
for Kevin and I felt a sharp
pain in my back. That's...

39:37.608 --> 39:39.166
My Iegs buckled.

39:39.243 --> 39:41.074
BENSON: Did you see anybody?

39:41.145 --> 39:43.636
No. By the time I Iooked up,
he was gone.

39:44.248 --> 39:46.341
Okay. We've posted
a uniformed officer outside,

39:46.417 --> 39:48.009
so no one's coming in.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.485
Detectives?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.016
AII these are for her?

39:54.091 --> 39:55.115
What the card says.

39:55.192 --> 39:56.420
Hold on.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.258
"Together forever.
Love, Me." Where is he?

40:02.333 --> 40:04.460
Delivery guy
just dropped them off.

40:04.969 --> 40:06.800
Hey, hey. Stop.

40:06.871 --> 40:07.929
What did I do?

40:08.005 --> 40:11.202
AII right. Let me see some ID.
Who sent the flowers?

40:11.275 --> 40:12.264
Not a clue. I just deliver.

40:12.343 --> 40:13.367
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:13.444 --> 40:14.706
Benson.

40:14.779 --> 40:15.768
Girlfriend's on the move.

40:15.846 --> 40:18.610
She's changed cabs twice,
rode all over hell and back.

40:18.682 --> 40:21.651
Finally Ianded at some dive
in Spanish Harlem.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.016
I'd make book on it.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.384
She's in Room 602.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.945
We got the hotel room.

40:31.095 --> 40:34.223
That's the room.
I'II take the fire escape
in case Terry bolts.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.163
I'II take the alley.

40:39.904 --> 40:42.805
Aimee, it's Detective Benson.

40:42.873 --> 40:44.101
Go away.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.304
Aimee, we're not
going anywhere.

40:47.378 --> 40:48.640
Now open up the door.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.623
Aimee, where's Terry?

41:06.697 --> 41:07.857
He's gone.

41:09.433 --> 41:10.957
Why are you still here?

41:11.035 --> 41:12.593
I had to take a shower.

41:15.473 --> 41:19.773
I was going to take him home
to Oklahoma,
so we could make a new Iife.

41:20.377 --> 41:23.869
But Terry wouldn't
Ieave that whore.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.710
You mean Cassie?

41:28.385 --> 41:30.717
I warned her
to Ieave him alone.

41:31.622 --> 41:34.523
So you attacked her.
You cut her hair.

41:35.092 --> 41:37.117
Well, she wouldn't Iisten.

41:37.728 --> 41:39.320
So you shot her.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.022
I had to stop her.

41:42.099 --> 41:44.090
I'm the only one
who really Ioves him.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.993
BENSON: Hell of a way
to show it.

41:54.211 --> 41:58.841
I didn't know what else to do.
She has so many men.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.179
Terry is all that I have.
