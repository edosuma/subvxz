00:27.261 --> 00:29.362
Can't we just enjoy
some family time together

00:29.364 --> 00:31.331
without Naare and her gang
dropping in?

00:31.333 --> 00:35.402
We knew they'd come.
It's the last crystal.

00:35.404 --> 00:40.073
And our last chance to stop Naare
from rebuilding the Kyber Saber.

00:40.075 --> 00:43.009
We're only talking about
the fate of the galaxy here, but...

00:43.011 --> 00:45.078
you know, no pressure.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.548
No pressure at all!

00:48.549 --> 00:51.217
Just another sunny
day for the Freemakers.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.353
Um, actually not so sunny.

00:53.355 --> 00:57.090
We've got major storm
conditions down on Hoth.

00:57.092 --> 01:00.160
Ooh!
Those are the conditions I like!

01:04.432 --> 01:06.433
What are you doing?

01:06.435 --> 01:09.269
- We can't see!
- Neither can they.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.442
My scanners can't pick up
a thing in this storm.

01:15.444 --> 01:18.345
The limitations of technology.

01:24.085 --> 01:28.121
- You said they couldn't see us!
- It was a lucky shot.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.393
Oh! We've lost
the port stabilizer!

01:33.395 --> 01:37.130
<i>ALL: Whoa!</i>

01:38.466 --> 01:40.467
Another lucky shot?

01:40.469 --> 01:43.303
What can I say?
Naare's on a roll.

01:43.305 --> 01:45.205
Just like us.

We're out of control!
Especially me!

[music]
[grunting]

02:30.718 --> 02:33.620
- Yes!
- Way to use the Force, little brother!

02:33.622 --> 02:35.182
We're not out of this yet.

02:35.183 --> 02:37.524
I'm still flying blind.
I can't see a thing!

02:39.694 --> 02:42.762
Like that mountain!
Pull up!

02:45.499 --> 02:47.767
Whoo-hoo!
The Force is with us today.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.307
- Look out!
- Waah!

02:57.845 --> 03:01.715
[crashing]
[all grunting]

03:07.588 --> 03:09.823

Ooh! But that is!

03:25.773 --> 03:27.941
<i>KORDI: Look at all that
sweet junk down there.</i>

03:27.943 --> 03:30.744
Sure we can't salvage
just a few things?

03:30.746 --> 03:33.880
And then what? We can't go
back to our shop and sell them.

03:33.882 --> 03:35.982
Not while Naare's out there.

03:36.951 --> 03:39.619
I'm the reason she's after us.

03:39.621 --> 03:42.455
- I should do this alone.
- Don't even think it.

03:42.457 --> 03:45.859
Yeah. Freemakers fly together
or they don't fly at all.

03:45.861 --> 03:47.927
<i>KORDI: That's right.</i>

03:49.697 --> 03:52.799
We're close. I feel it.

03:52.801 --> 03:56.770
- The crystal is below us.
- Then below we go.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.542

04:03.744 --> 04:06.880
<i>ZANDER: Another smooth
landing for Zander Freemaker.</i>

04:14.655 --> 04:19.492
Why couldn't the last crystal be
hidden on a nice, warm, tropical planet?

04:19.494 --> 04:22.762
Uh, guys, my hydraulics
are freezing up.

04:22.764 --> 04:25.765
Okay, Roger. Then stay with
the ship and keep it warm.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.934
Roger, roger!

04:27.936 --> 04:31.671
You guys stay too.
I can do this alone.

04:31.673 --> 04:36.676
No way! The Freemakers freeze
together or they don't freeze at all.

04:36.678 --> 04:38.945
I'd prefer sticking together
without freezing.

04:38.947 --> 04:43.583
- But Zander's right.
- Okay. This way then.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.854
<i>KORDI [shivering]: You
couldn't have landed any closer?</i>

04:47.856 --> 04:50.690
<i>ZANDER: Hey, you're lucky
I was able to land at all.</i>

04:52.993 --> 04:57.030
Cheap on-board heaters. It's
barely above frosty in here.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.701
Hmm, maybe if I power up
the sub-light engines

05:01.703 --> 05:04.604
just a little.
[beeps]

05:07.775 --> 05:10.877
Roger, you are a genius.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.084
Uh-oh. Abandon ship!

05:19.820 --> 05:22.055
Gaah! Oh!

05:25.659 --> 05:29.696
[gasps, panting]

05:29.698 --> 05:34.701
Now I'm not feeling
like such a... genius.

05:34.703 --> 05:36.035
[grunts]

05:37.671 --> 05:39.038
Getting closer.

05:39.040 --> 05:43.042
Closer, maybe, but we sure
aren't getting any warmer.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.049
[screeching]
Did you hear that?

05:50.051 --> 05:54.721
No, my teeth are chattering
too loud to hear anything.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.895
[snarling]
[gasping]

06:13.774 --> 06:16.910
Far be it for me to tell you
how to do your job.

06:16.912 --> 06:20.713
- Good choice.
- But, I mean, if you were asking.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.081
Here it comes.

06:22.083 --> 06:25.084
I mean, can't you use
the Force to find the kid?

06:25.086 --> 06:26.920
That's how it works, right?

06:26.922 --> 06:29.122
You just... hmm...
then you can tell where he is?

06:29.124 --> 06:34.060
I can't sense him.
All I can sense is... fear.

06:34.062 --> 06:37.630
Oh, oh, that's me.
Yeah, I'm loaded with anxieties.

06:37.632 --> 06:39.866
I got anxieties
like nobody's business.

06:39.868 --> 06:41.801
It's not you.

06:41.803 --> 06:45.138
[sighs]
The Freemakers are in danger.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.711
Run! I'll hold this thing off
as long as I can.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.949
[squawking]

06:55.951 --> 06:58.117
Um... or...

06:58.119 --> 07:00.153
He'll hold me?
[mewing]

07:00.155 --> 07:01.821
<i>KORDI, ROWAN: Aww!</i>

07:01.823 --> 07:04.757
- He thinks you're his mother!
- Ha-ha.

07:04.759 --> 07:06.893
But what happens when
his real mother turns up?

07:06.895 --> 07:11.864
- You can exchange parenting tips.
- Come on! The crystal's close.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.837
- Whoa.
- Ah!

07:19.126 --> 07:22.427

07:23.010 --> 07:26.145
<i>ROWAN: One of those
is the Kyber Saber crystal.</i>

07:26.147 --> 07:29.960
- But which one?
- Yeah.

07:29.995 --> 07:33.820
It's too bad you can't call
the crystals like they call to you.

07:33.822 --> 07:37.190
Huh.
Never thought of that.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.874
[grunting]

08:03.050 --> 08:04.851
- I...
- Yes!

08:04.853 --> 08:07.954
I did it! I got the last
Kyber Saber crystal!

08:07.956 --> 08:11.891
- Yeah! [chuckling]
- Great! Now we can...

08:11.893 --> 08:14.060
[gasps]

to finish the sentence?

<i>Aaah!</i>

08:38.052 --> 08:42.221
- Everybody okay?
- A little snow in my parka, but I'm good.

08:42.222 --> 08:46.025
Good. Feels like I've got
a whole glacier in mine.

08:46.027 --> 08:47.894
[groans]
Oh!

08:47.896 --> 08:50.897
No, wait. It's just this guy.
Eek!

08:50.899 --> 08:54.067
For a thing covered in fur,
he's sure got cold feet.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.272
Let's get back to the ship
and blast off this snowball.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.012

09:15.023 --> 09:18.024
[roars, sniffing]

09:22.062 --> 09:24.864
Um, where's our ship?

09:24.866 --> 09:27.200
I see our droid,
but no StarScavenger.

09:27.202 --> 09:30.036
Odds are those two facts
are very related.

09:30.038 --> 09:32.872
Roger? Roger?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.908
Roger!
Where's our ship?

09:35.910 --> 09:38.978
Gen-i-us.

09:38.980 --> 09:41.814
- "Genius"?
- Genius.

09:41.816 --> 09:45.952
Ah, great. His language
circuits are frozen solid.

09:45.954 --> 09:48.321
His vocalizers are stuck,
so he's just going to say...

09:48.323 --> 09:50.923
- Genius!
- ...until they thaw.

09:50.925 --> 09:54.927
- Well, that's just...
- Genius!

09:54.929 --> 09:58.064
Guys, I think I found the ship.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.103
<i>We're standing on it.</i>

10:04.105 --> 10:07.273
[groans] It'll take hours, maybe
days to get it out of there!

10:07.275 --> 10:10.176
We'll freeze if we don't
find shelter fast.

10:10.178 --> 10:14.914
We could hole up in one of those wrecked
walkers, but they're ice cold too.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.985
<i>ROWAN: Is somebody in
that abandoned base?</i>

10:18.987 --> 10:21.121
I don't care. If they've got heat,

10:21.122 --> 10:23.256
I'd be happy to see the Emperor himself.

10:26.326 --> 10:32.331
"Join the Empire and see exotic
planets before we destroy them."

10:32.333 --> 10:35.935
[sighs]
I'd very much like to do that.

10:35.937 --> 10:40.139
Please! I'd rather see
a soft cot and a hot cup of caf.

10:40.141 --> 10:43.342
You know, I thought we were doomed
after the Emperor's museum debacle,

10:43.344 --> 10:47.046
but this assignment is top notch.

10:47.048 --> 10:50.183
Ensign Durpin,
we'll never see action here.

10:50.185 --> 10:53.119
Exactly, Sub-Ensign Plumestriker.

10:53.121 --> 10:55.055
We'll never see anyone here.

10:55.056 --> 10:56.989
Certainly not any Rebels.

10:56.991 --> 10:58.958
[alarm blaring]
Huh? What is it?

10:58.960 --> 11:02.094

- ZANDER: Whoa!

11:17.245 --> 11:20.146
Um, we're not Rebels.

11:20.148 --> 11:23.479
- But we've got the freezing part down.
- ROGER: Genius.

11:23.514 --> 11:27.221
- [gasps] You three!
- And you!

11:27.256 --> 11:30.056
Hey, buddy, long time no see!
How've you been?

11:30.058 --> 11:32.425
[gasps]
You three!

11:32.427 --> 11:35.161
- We've already been through that.
- Can we come in now?

11:35.163 --> 11:39.983
Yes! You are under arrest
in the name of the Empire!

11:41.368 --> 11:44.370
What are you doing?
Leave them out there to freeze!

11:44.372 --> 11:50.343
Sir, this is your chance to climb
back up the Imperial chain of command.

11:51.345 --> 11:53.946
This is Hoth Base One.
We've captured...

11:53.948 --> 11:56.115
I don't want that chance!

11:56.117 --> 11:58.251
You don't know
what you're saying, sir.

11:58.253 --> 12:02.137
I know exactly what I'm saying.
For instance, I just said,

12:02.172 --> 12:04.290
"I know exactly what I'm saying!"
You see?

12:04.292 --> 12:07.226
- I get it.
- Genius.

12:07.228 --> 12:10.779
- Actually, quite the opposite.
- You three, get out of here!

12:10.814 --> 12:12.298
Go back to where you
came from. Out, out, out!

12:12.300 --> 12:15.067
[blowing raspberry]
[grunts]

12:15.069 --> 12:17.303
I'm doing this
for your own good, sir!

12:17.305 --> 12:21.140
Not on my watch, you're not!

12:21.142 --> 12:24.210
- Whoa!
- Careful with that thing!

12:26.280 --> 12:28.281
[bites]
Ow!

12:28.283 --> 12:30.249
- Ow!
- High command!

12:30.251 --> 12:34.170
We've apprehended three dangerous
criminals at Hoth Base One!

12:34.205 --> 12:35.121
Please send backup!

and a rusty Clone Wars-era battle droid!</i>

<i>- Request backup!
- That's the Freemakers.</i>

12:43.097 --> 12:45.097
They're at
the abandoned Rebel base!

12:45.099 --> 12:48.729
Get it off, and I won't demote you!
Get it off!

12:48.764 --> 12:51.337
You can't demote me any
lower than sub-ensign, sir.

12:51.339 --> 12:54.073
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off!

12:54.075 --> 12:57.109

- Hey!

12:57.111 --> 12:59.445

They grow up so fast, then they just
leave without even saying good-bye.

13:33.185 --> 13:36.115
- Genius.
- We're not out of this yet.

13:36.117 --> 13:39.151
You can bet Naare and Graballa
intercepted Plumestriker's call.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.187
Which means they're
coming for the crystal,

13:41.189 --> 13:44.718
<i>and we need to get ready for a fight.

13:53.364 --> 13:56.232

We've got tools,
and, Rowan, you have the Force.

a few... surprises.

[roaring, screaming]

14:33.237 --> 14:35.171
Yeah!

14:35.173 --> 14:38.107
- Genius.
- Thanks, Roger!

14:38.109 --> 14:40.176
Wait, was that...

14:40.178 --> 14:43.179
Never mind. I'm taking
the compliment either way.

14:51.121 --> 14:53.122

14:56.093 --> 14:59.028
Hmm. Rowan's Force skills
are improving.

15:00.864 --> 15:03.933
- Light 'em up!
- Genius!

15:06.103 --> 15:08.337
Their shooting skills
aren't too shabby either.

15:11.108 --> 15:14.537
Welcome to Freemaker Base.

15:26.223 --> 15:29.158
Oh! We're going down!
Wait! Where's the safe...

15:29.160 --> 15:32.161
- Does this thing have safety cushions?
- Nope.

15:42.339 --> 15:44.407
Look! The StarScavenger!

15:52.316 --> 15:55.051
You've got company.

16:38.328 --> 16:42.198
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

16:43.066 --> 16:45.067
Targeting!
Maximum firepower!

16:59.015 --> 17:01.417
[all cheering]
Yeah!

17:02.319 --> 17:05.320
- So therapeutic.
- Genius!

17:07.223 --> 17:10.159
We're not done!

17:10.527 --> 17:14.057
[music]

17:21.538 --> 17:24.073
- We need to move!
- Genius!

17:26.009 --> 17:27.309
Aaah!

17:30.247 --> 17:33.115
- No!
- Kordi!

17:34.117 --> 17:39.188
[groans] I'm okay, but
we need to go before...

17:39.190 --> 17:43.159
Before I grace you with my presence?
Mmm, too late.

17:44.428 --> 17:47.463
Nowhere to run.
Nowhere to hide.

17:47.465 --> 17:51.434
- Give me the crystal.
- Never!

17:51.436 --> 17:55.070
Oh, Rowan,
you poor deluded child.

17:55.072 --> 17:57.139
- You know you can't beat...
- Aaah!

17:57.141 --> 18:00.176
[screaming]

18:01.111 --> 18:03.446
[growls]

18:06.082 --> 18:08.551
I don't think she saw us.
[comlink buzzing]

18:08.553 --> 18:11.120
<i>- Of course I saw you.
- Blast!</i>

18:11.122 --> 18:14.123
<i>Come out, Rowan. You can't
stay in there forever.</i>

18:14.125 --> 18:17.460
<i>And you can't beat me in a fight.
[sighs]</i>

18:17.462 --> 18:20.129
<i>I have a generous offer for you.</i>

18:20.131 --> 18:25.234
<i>Give me the last crystal, and you
and your siblings may walk away.</i>

18:25.236 --> 18:29.271
What a pile of poodoo.
We can fight our way out of this.

18:29.273 --> 18:31.407
- We can't.
- We can!

18:31.409 --> 18:35.478
Even if, then what?
Naare's never going to give up.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.148
If we took her offer,
we could go home again.

18:39.150 --> 18:44.420
Back to the Wheel.
Isn't that what we really want?

18:44.422 --> 18:50.326
Rowan, if Naare gets that saber,
nobody's home will be safe.

18:51.461 --> 18:54.163
Yeah. She can kiss a Sarlacc.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.236
Guys, I know what I have to do.

19:02.472 --> 19:04.507
Could we hurry this up?

19:04.509 --> 19:07.427
I mean, I know I look good
in this, but this ensemble

19:07.428 --> 19:10.346
features fashion over
function, you know what I mean?

19:10.348 --> 19:13.482
- I'm freezing my tail off out here!
- Patience.

19:13.484 --> 19:16.385
We will soon have the last crystal.

19:16.387 --> 19:19.588
I thought so.
Just checkin'.

19:26.196 --> 19:29.365
You win. Take it.

19:29.367 --> 19:31.233
[gasps]

19:31.235 --> 19:36.472
At last. Finally!
[laughs]

19:36.474 --> 19:38.541
<i>My mission is complete!</i>

19:38.543 --> 19:42.478
Ah, I can feel the power
flowing through me.

19:49.386 --> 19:51.453
That... is... something.

19:56.192 --> 20:01.350
Behold the awesome
might of the Kyber Sa...

20:01.431 --> 20:03.347
Eh...

20:05.335 --> 20:08.370
Oh, is it supposed to do that?

20:08.372 --> 20:12.408
If so, you need to rethink
how you use the word "awesome."

20:12.410 --> 20:16.278
Yeah, you're robbing it
of its meaning through overuse.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.347
The crystal. It was...

20:18.349 --> 20:22.261
Ha! Ice.
The kid duped you.

20:26.189 --> 20:28.424
[screaming] Nooo!

20:35.532 --> 20:38.601
[laughs]
Pretty slick, Rowan.

20:38.603 --> 20:41.537
I just wish I could've
seen Naare's face.

20:41.539 --> 20:43.539
Genius!

20:43.541 --> 20:45.374
And I really mean that this time.

20:45.376 --> 20:47.543
My language processor
finally thawed out.

20:47.545 --> 20:50.546
We won.
But what now?

20:50.548 --> 20:52.548
We can never go home.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.551
As long as we're together,
that's our home.

20:55.553 --> 20:59.455
<i>ZANDER: Exactly. Pick a star,
any star, and we'll go there.</i>

21:01.558 --> 21:03.425
You guys pick.

21:03.427 --> 21:07.630
I'm gonna take Roger into the
back and check his circuits.

21:07.632 --> 21:10.466
I wouldn't say no to a hot oil bath.

21:10.468 --> 21:13.702
- How about Kamino?
- Hmm, too moist.

21:18.408 --> 21:20.643
- Tatooine?
- Too dry.

21:20.645 --> 21:25.137
[chiming] The cargo
bay doors are opening.

21:28.251 --> 21:30.319
Is that Rowan?

21:30.321 --> 21:32.521
<i>Zander. Kordi.</i>

21:32.523 --> 21:35.591
<i>The crystals called to me,
not you guys.</i>

21:35.593 --> 21:37.593
<i>It's my duty to keep them safe.</i>

21:37.595 --> 21:42.698
Rowan Freemaker, you fly that Ugly
right back here this instant!

21:42.700 --> 21:44.700
I can't, Kordi.

21:44.702 --> 21:47.636
If the Freemakers
keep flying together,

21:47.638 --> 21:49.638
we're not going to fly at all.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.641
<i>- ZANDER: What are you saying?
- Rowan, don't do this.</i>

21:52.643 --> 21:55.628
<i>I'm sorry. You guys have been the best</i>

21:55.629 --> 21:58.614
<i>brother and sister
a kid could ever have.</i>

21:58.616 --> 22:02.737
<i>I love you,
but I have to go.</i>

22:04.621 --> 22:07.690
<i>BOTH: Rowan!</i>

22:07.691 --> 22:11.399
[music]

22:13.396 --> 22:14.730
[sighs]

22:14.732 --> 22:17.466
So, what are we doing exactly?

22:17.468 --> 22:20.135
We're keeping them safe, Roger.

22:20.337 --> 22:22.805
We're keeping everyone safe.
