00:00.410 --> 00:03.390
Uh, well, your
grandfather, William Walker,

00:03.420 --> 00:09.370
he named Ojai Foods after his
childhood home, Ojai, California. 

00:09.410 --> 00:16.590
He grew up working on his father's citrus farm
before moving here and starting this company. 

00:16.620 --> 00:20.460
He grew up in the tradition
of the family farm, and, um,

00:20.490 --> 00:23.710
that's how he wanted to run Ojai Foods. 

00:23.730 --> 00:29.340
Now obviously, your Uncle Saul and
your Uncle Tommy and I worked here,

00:29.370 --> 00:35.390
but dad tried very hard to make everybody
who worked here feel like family. 

00:35.420 --> 00:36.910
Uh, Paige, I don't... 

00:36.950 --> 00:39.530
I'm not sure I'm the best
person to interview. You know,

00:39.560 --> 00:43.170
my... my own brother fired
me from being Ojai's lawyer. 

00:43.200 --> 00:47.170
Uh, well, we're supposed to do
an oral history on our family, and

00:47.200 --> 00:50.650
I think this is a lot more dramatic
than hearing Daniel Petrova's grandpa

00:50.690 --> 00:52.960
talk about his hip replacement. 

00:53.590 --> 00:56.270
Okay. Well said. 

00:56.310 --> 00:59.930
Okay, Uncle Saul, we'll,
uh, we'll start with this... 

00:59.970 --> 01:02.980
What does Ojai Foods mean to you?

01:03.010 --> 01:07.680
Okay. What does Ojai foods mean to me?

01:12.870 --> 01:15.200
Well... 

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.280 --> 01:35.150
I think we're gonna have to do
this another time. Okay, sweetheart?

01:37.840 --> 01:40.670
As I look around, I, um,

01:40.710 --> 01:44.260
I see some of you I've known
since I was a little girl,

01:44.300 --> 01:50.240
others since dad gave Tommy
and me our first summer jobs. 

01:50.270 --> 01:54.360
Some of you have worked
here for over 30 years. 

01:54.400 --> 02:00.510
All of you have been so
loyal and worked so hard

02:00.550 --> 02:06.300
and put so much of yourselves
into building this company. 

02:08.680 --> 02:13.430
But Ojai Foods will be closing
its doors for good this week. 

02:13.470 --> 02:15.730
Oh, man. 

02:16.690 --> 02:18.940
I want you to know that, um,

02:18.980 --> 02:23.730
that we intend to honor our... our
commitment to you with full severance. 

02:23.760 --> 02:26.650
Your benefits are fully protected,

02:26.690 --> 02:32.190
and we're here to help out with any
job assistance that you may need. 

02:33.530 --> 02:38.080
You are the heart and
the soul of this company. 

02:38.110 --> 02:41.580
I am so very sorry. 

02:43.360 --> 02:45.970
The employee benefit fund is solid. 

02:46.020 --> 02:47.450
They're gonna get paid first. 

02:47.470 --> 02:50.340
And then we have the
bank loans and the taxes. 

02:50.370 --> 02:55.120
And then after that, the vendors, the
contractors and the other creditors. 

02:55.150 --> 02:57.690
Okay, listen, I just want to say

02:57.740 --> 03:01.070
that I intend to get every last
Penny of equity out of this company

03:01.110 --> 03:02.920
for you and for the rest of the family. 

03:02.950 --> 03:05.910
Well, Sarah, that's a very noble
goal, but it's totally unrealistic. 

03:05.940 --> 03:08.740
I mean, inevitably, there
will be pain for everyone. 

03:08.780 --> 03:12.000
Well, I'm sorry, Saul. I am
not prepared to accept that. 

03:12.040 --> 03:14.050
Okay, Tommy, what's the
status on the land sale?

03:14.080 --> 03:17.590
Most of the contracts on the
real estate are done, and... 

03:17.630 --> 03:19.630
We're negotiating the sale of the winery. 

03:19.660 --> 03:20.680
Great. Okay. 

03:20.720 --> 03:25.410
I have a prospective buyer coming in
to tour the building this afternoon. 

03:25.440 --> 03:28.390
Oh, I know we have to do
it, but it breaks my heart. 

03:28.420 --> 03:30.120
Okay. What else?

03:30.160 --> 03:32.000
I have a liquidation company coming in. 

03:32.030 --> 03:35.270
They're gonna value the
furniture and the equipment. 

03:35.310 --> 03:38.870
We'll sell the semis, the
delivery trucks, the vans... 

03:38.920 --> 03:40.240
That will go in the credit column. 

03:40.280 --> 03:44.490
But the problem is time. The longer
we take, the more money we spend. 

03:44.530 --> 03:47.390
Right. Kevin's gonna need a
few computers and printers. 

03:47.420 --> 03:49.560
He volunteered to run
the job placement office. 

03:49.600 --> 03:50.990
That's fine. 

03:51.020 --> 03:53.840
- Anything else?
- No. 

03:54.630 --> 03:57.110
Okay, then. Let's get to work. 

04:00.050 --> 04:02.350
Okay, I have a 15-month-old son

04:02.390 --> 04:04.480
who's at that stage
where he crosses his arms

04:04.520 --> 04:10.260
and he sticks out his lower lip
and he says,"no" to everything. 

04:10.280 --> 04:16.019
I mean, I had no idea that motherhood
would be so much like the senate. 

04:17.850 --> 04:19.570
See? Do you see?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.070
I can't tell a joke. 

04:21.100 --> 04:23.150
Well, t... try saying it faster.

04:23.190 --> 04:25.500
I am so screwed. 

04:25.540 --> 04:29.080
Every winning candidate for statewide
office, going all the way back to Reagan,

04:29.120 --> 04:30.900
has killed at the gold rush dinner. 

04:30.930 --> 04:33.030
I can't afford to be less
funny than my opponent. 

04:33.060 --> 04:35.770
I... I can't afford
to go up there and die.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.430
No. Come on. Come on. 

04:37.460 --> 04:38.690
We're gonna rally. We have to do this. 

04:38.730 --> 04:39.550
- No, no, no. 
- Yeah, yeah. 

04:39.590 --> 04:42.230
Look, look, now that we've got me
sitting next to the Attorney General,

04:42.280 --> 04:44.990
if you go out there screw
up and shame the family,

04:45.030 --> 04:46.050
he's never gonna give me a job. 

04:46.090 --> 04:47.640
- Here we go. 
- Great, great. That's right, Kevin. 

04:47.690 --> 04:49.150
Let's just make it all about you. 

04:49.190 --> 04:52.010
Yeah, l... I'm ready to laugh. Seriously. 

04:52.040 --> 04:53.940
Go. 

04:53.970 --> 04:58.000
Oh, you know, this one actually is
- is probably one of my best. 

04:58.040 --> 04:58.730
Great. 

04:58.770 --> 05:01.210
Have you ever noticed how the
democrats blame the Republicans

05:01.260 --> 05:03.800
for everything that
goes wrong in this state?

05:03.840 --> 05:07.810
I mean, one of them is sponsoring a
new bill to rename the San Andreas fault

05:07.860 --> 05:11.730
"the Republicans' fault. "

05:16.790 --> 05:19.630
- That is totally a fake laugh. 
- No, it's not. 

05:19.660 --> 05:20.450
- It's not fake. 
- Yes, it is. 

05:20.480 --> 05:22.870
- Don't lie to a dying woman. 
- Don't say that. 

05:22.900 --> 05:26.080
- It's probably just the material. 
- I'm doomed!

05:27.720 --> 05:29.510
- Um, Mr. Wright?
- Yes. 

05:29.550 --> 05:31.130
Hi. I'm Nora Walker. 

05:31.150 --> 05:32.790
I... I'm Sarah's mother.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.430
She's busy right now... 

05:34.470 --> 05:36.490
but I... I could show you
around, if that's all right.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.700
I'm sorry to have to meet
you under these circumstances. 

05:39.730 --> 05:43.010
I run a family operation,
too. Both my boys work for me. 

05:43.050 --> 05:45.520
So I know this must be
hitting you all very hard. 

05:45.550 --> 05:47.610
Yes. Thank you. That's very kind of you. 

05:47.660 --> 05:50.020
We can take the back stairway here. 

05:50.070 --> 05:53.760
This whole neighborhood has changed
so much over the past few years. 

05:53.800 --> 05:55.190
There used to be nothing here,

05:55.230 --> 05:57.980
and now there's so many
restaurants and shops and

05:58.010 --> 06:01.210
a lot of these buildings are
being converted into lofts. 

06:01.250 --> 06:03.940
Well, that's exactly why I'm here. 

06:04.600 --> 06:06.920
Really?

06:06.960 --> 06:08.320
Really?

06:08.360 --> 06:11.120
Oh, I can't tell you
how happy that makes me. 

06:11.150 --> 06:16.380
Uh, this place has been such a big
and important part of my family. 

06:17.300 --> 06:22.450
Well, the idea that other families
might move here and... and be happy... 

06:22.490 --> 06:25.200
It just makes selling
the place almost bearable. 

06:25.240 --> 06:28.110
I'm sorry, but I think you
may have the wrong idea. 

06:28.140 --> 06:31.270
I own Wright & sons parking systems. 

06:31.310 --> 06:35.420
We build and operate parking structures. 

06:35.450 --> 06:37.150
So you're not interested in the building?

06:37.180 --> 06:40.020
No, just the property it sits on. 

06:40.060 --> 06:43.930
- Your daughter didn't tell you?
- No, she didn't. 

06:43.960 --> 06:47.570
- You told him to go away?
- Yes, I sent him away, Sarah. 

06:47.610 --> 06:51.280
How can you even consider selling the place
to someone who just wants to tear it down?

06:51.320 --> 06:53.310
Because he made the best offer. 

06:53.340 --> 06:55.640
But, Sarah, this building is
the only thing left to show

06:55.690 --> 06:58.870
that we were ever here, that
the company even existed. 

06:58.910 --> 07:02.190
How can you sell it to someone who just
wants to scrape it off the face of the earth?

07:02.240 --> 07:03.390
You think I want to?

07:03.420 --> 07:05.490
Did you even try to find someone else?

07:05.540 --> 07:06.710
What do you think?

07:06.750 --> 07:09.630
Of course I did, mom. We are
damn lucky we found this guy. 

07:09.660 --> 07:12.620
- There has to be someone. 
- It's a building, for God sake. 

07:12.660 --> 07:15.190
While it might hold some
sentimental value for us,

07:15.220 --> 07:17.950
I can't let that keep us
from making the right deal. 

07:17.990 --> 07:23.530
Fine. Then I will find someone
to buy the building myself. 

07:23.560 --> 07:25.760
Fine. You have two days.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.310
So... so what do you think, Sergio?

07:34.340 --> 07:36.750
They've got experience, they're loyal, they're honest.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.130
Sarah, if it was up to me,
I'd hire your entire crew. 

07:39.170 --> 07:41.410
But I can't make any more
hires until business picks up. 

07:41.450 --> 07:42.930
Okay, listen. Cut the crap. 

07:42.980 --> 07:45.150
Your biggest competitor
is going out of business. 

07:45.180 --> 07:48.020
If you don't start making a lot of
money, you're doing something wrong. 

07:48.050 --> 07:50.300
I mean, you can at least
hire some of our guys. 

07:50.340 --> 07:54.720
Sergio, hey. Listen, we appreciate
anything you can do, all right?

07:54.760 --> 07:55.530
Thanks, Tommy. 

07:55.560 --> 07:57.200
Things... things are a
little tough right now. 

07:57.240 --> 08:00.180
You know I'd like to help, but
the economy is bad right now. 

08:00.210 --> 08:01.110
That's... stop it. 

08:01.150 --> 08:03.540
Look, we... we understand, all right?

08:03.570 --> 08:06.540
And if things change, just
keep us in mind, all right?

08:06.580 --> 08:08.780
You got it, Tommy. We'll
speak to you soon. Bye. 

08:08.820 --> 08:10.290
You just let him off the hook. 

08:10.320 --> 08:13.780
Sarah, what are you doing? You
need to calm down, all right?

08:13.810 --> 08:16.750
You can't single-handedly
find jobs for everybody. 

08:16.790 --> 08:19.300
We're putting a lot of people out of work,

08:19.330 --> 08:22.340
people with families, with mortgages. 

08:22.380 --> 08:24.420
I will put as much pressure on as I can. 

08:24.450 --> 08:26.350
I understand,

08:26.370 --> 08:30.030
but you gotta take it easy on
everybody, including yourself. 

08:30.060 --> 08:31.950
Look, you've already got mom all upset. 

08:31.980 --> 08:36.700
Yeah, well, mom seems to care a lot more about
bricks and mortar than she does about people. 

08:38.100 --> 08:41.640
Sarah, just dial it back, okay?

08:41.690 --> 08:43.500
Take a deep breath. 

08:43.530 --> 08:47.400
I don't need to worry about
you on top of everything else. 

08:49.490 --> 08:51.840
Holly, are you sure
this is the last of them?

08:51.880 --> 08:55.620
Yeah. I'm sure. Thanks for
picking up all the boxes. 

08:55.660 --> 08:58.190
Wow. Look at you. 

08:58.210 --> 09:00.260
Oh. You like my hair like this?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.520
Oh, you look fantastic. 

09:01.550 --> 09:05.180
Can you believe I am trying to get
a job at another produce company?

09:05.220 --> 09:08.800
Listen to me. Maddox Thompson is a great
place, and they are all going to love you. 

09:08.840 --> 09:12.070
I hope so, because I really need a job. 

09:12.110 --> 09:15.820
Don't worry about it. You're
gonna get this job, sweetheart. 

09:15.870 --> 09:19.420
When's the last time you called me
"sweetheart," when we were dating?

09:19.450 --> 09:20.880
Dating. 

09:20.920 --> 09:23.550
Can you imagine if we had stayed together?

09:23.580 --> 09:26.750
Yeah, you and I in our
platonic relationship,

09:26.790 --> 09:30.810
snuggled in front of the TV
watching old classic movies. 

09:31.260 --> 09:33.710
That should've been my first clue. 

09:33.740 --> 09:37.330
Well, that and our mutual
love for Kander and Ebb. 

09:38.600 --> 09:43.250
Well, there's a lot to be
said for good companionship. 

09:43.280 --> 09:45.450
I'll say there is. All right. Go ahead. 

09:45.490 --> 09:47.050
- You're gonna get this job. 
- Okay. All right. 

09:47.850 --> 09:49.830
- I'll lock up. 
- Okay. 

09:50.750 --> 09:54.080
Listen, Ron. I'm meeting
with Stanton tonight. 

09:54.560 --> 09:56.490
Look, I want to take him
down as badly as you do,

09:56.520 --> 09:58.620
but I have to wait for
him to make me an offer. 

09:58.660 --> 10:00.530
I can't just force this. 

10:00.550 --> 10:02.310
You guys just gotta be patient. 

10:02.840 --> 10:03.910
- I gotta go. 
- Hello!

10:03.950 --> 10:07.110
- Hey. 
- Hey, s... 

10:07.140 --> 10:09.570
whoa, you're not going anywhere, right?

10:09.590 --> 10:11.390
No, I'm sorry. Something came up. 

10:11.420 --> 10:13.310
No, I need you to stay
and laugh at Kitty's jokes. 

10:13.340 --> 10:14.370
I thought you hired a joke writer. 

10:14.420 --> 10:15.870
Yeah, I did. He wrote six pages. 

10:15.910 --> 10:17.530
But she's completely lost her confidence. 

10:17.560 --> 10:18.910
So I need a nice audience. 

10:18.930 --> 10:20.740
Scotty's coming, but he's a weak laugher. 

10:20.770 --> 10:22.910
I'm sorry. I can't do it. 

10:22.940 --> 10:23.800
Everything okay?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.680
Yeah, I just... I've lost my car keys.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.620
Try the side pocket. 

10:29.500 --> 10:30.130
- You're good. 
- I know. 

10:30.160 --> 10:33.570
That's why you used to pay
me the medium bucks. So... 

10:33.610 --> 10:35.450
Are you off to one of your... 

10:35.460 --> 10:39.560
Secret defense department's clandestine
black ops espionage meetings?

10:39.590 --> 10:41.400
I'm so deep undercover, that
most people are gonna think

10:41.440 --> 10:44.500
I'm eating chicken dinner and
talking about trade tariffs. 

10:44.540 --> 10:47.170
A meeting on trade tariffs just came up?

10:47.200 --> 10:50.210
Would you cross-examine someone
else? And tell Kitty I said good-bye. 

10:50.250 --> 10:55.960
If you were doing something
covert or dangerous or unethical,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.030
you would tell me, right?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.680
No, I wouldn't. 

10:59.710 --> 11:01.410
But I'm not. 

11:01.440 --> 11:02.950
So drop it. 

11:14.510 --> 11:15.770
Thanks for coming in. 

11:15.820 --> 11:17.490
We'll be in touch. 

11:18.460 --> 11:19.880
- Holly Harper. 
- Hi. 

11:19.910 --> 11:21.490
- It's good to see you. 
- Thanks. 

11:21.510 --> 11:24.160
- I was sorry to hear about Ojai. 
- Oh, thanks, Tim. 

11:24.200 --> 11:27.210
- And it's nice of you to meet with me. 
- Oh, well, of course. 

11:27.240 --> 11:29.460
Um, I just feel I should
tell you right up front,

11:29.490 --> 11:32.360
you are completely
overqualified for this position. 

11:32.390 --> 11:36.600
Well, I just want to try
something new, expand my horizons. 

11:36.630 --> 11:38.540
All right, then. Well, you want any
coffee or anything before we start?

11:38.570 --> 11:42.530
- No, no. I'm fine. 
- Great. Then come on in. 

11:42.560 --> 11:44.630
Now this is a winner. 

11:44.660 --> 11:47.530
"a lot of people think "I'm running
for my husband's senate seat "

11:47.560 --> 11:49.630
to prove that I'm as good as he is. 

11:49.660 --> 11:53.710
"Actually, we just didn't want
to lose the health insurance. "

11:53.750 --> 11:54.910
You see? That's hilarious. 

11:54.950 --> 11:58.010
No, Kevin. It's terrible.
It's absolutely terrible.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.180
- Scotty,i... is that funny?
- I don't think so.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.530
- Scotty. 
- I'm sorry, but I think these jokes are lame. 

12:02.560 --> 12:04.440
I paid good money for these jokes. 

12:04.470 --> 12:06.760
Yeah, well, they must have
been having 2-for-1 sale. 

12:06.790 --> 12:08.880
At the lame joke store. 

12:10.010 --> 12:12.440
This guy's, like, the
top Hollywood joke writer. 

12:12.470 --> 12:15.530
Yeah. Hollywood, Florida. 

12:16.510 --> 12:18.510
- That's funny. 
- Well, thank you. 

12:18.540 --> 12:21.720
Oh, here's one. Oh, this is good. 

12:21.760 --> 12:24.420
"Now that my husband has decided
not to run for reelection,

12:24.450 --> 12:27.010
he's always asking me to
cook his favorite dish... 

12:27.060 --> 12:30.030
Lame duck soup."

12:30.070 --> 12:33.400
Chemotherapy was more amusing than that. 

12:34.470 --> 12:37.370
That was funny... she is funny.
Why don't you think she's funny?

12:37.410 --> 12:39.080
Yeah, Kevin. Why don't
you think I'm funny?

12:39.120 --> 12:42.450
You are funny, but in a smart-assy
type of way. Is that what you want?

12:42.480 --> 12:45.460
You want to stand up at the
gold rush and be a smartass?

12:45.500 --> 12:48.180
All right. Fine. I... I'm trying.

12:48.220 --> 12:51.670
I... I really am. It's just
that this is not my thing. 

12:51.710 --> 12:53.850
Okay. Oh, here's one. 

12:53.880 --> 12:57.210
Um, "Bill Clinton, the
DalaÃ¯ Lama" and Mick Jagger

12:57.250 --> 13:00.140
- are teaming up at the pebble"... 
- Teeing up. 

13:00.170 --> 13:03.790
Oh, wait a minute. They're golfing. 

13:03.820 --> 13:05.190
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- Oh, this could be good. 

13:05.220 --> 13:08.280
Okay, we've got the DalaÃ¯
Lama, we've got Mick Jagger. 

13:10.840 --> 13:12.660
Stanton. 

13:12.690 --> 13:14.610
Sorry about the accommodations,

13:14.650 --> 13:17.010
but it wouldn't do either one of
us any good to be seen together. 

13:17.040 --> 13:18.240
I don't know. 

13:18.270 --> 13:21.040
Are we doing something wrong?

13:21.070 --> 13:24.170
Well, you're coming to the end of
your term. You're gonna need a job. 

13:24.210 --> 13:26.960
And I think I have one for you. 

13:26.990 --> 13:29.210
I'm a donor at the Cardwell Institute,

13:29.240 --> 13:32.160
and I know that they'd
be thrilled to have you. 

13:33.340 --> 13:36.110
I can guarantee you $7 million a year. 

13:36.140 --> 13:38.170
$7 million?

13:38.210 --> 13:41.420
Well, that is generous and... 

13:41.460 --> 13:42.880
Conspicuous. 

13:42.910 --> 13:46.190
We can direct most of it to an
offshore account if you want. 

13:46.230 --> 13:49.650
And it's not generous when you consider
the good you're gonna do for us. 

13:49.680 --> 13:54.400
$7 million doesn't even cover
the paper clips on this project. 

13:54.430 --> 13:57.270
Well, the committee meets next
week to approve the contract,

13:57.310 --> 14:02.170
and I think I can get the votes.
I don't see any real opposition.

14:02.210 --> 14:04.540
And if there is?

14:05.230 --> 14:07.550
I'll take care of it. 

14:18.820 --> 14:20.610
And how many applicants did they have?

14:20.640 --> 14:23.730
Counting me and my guys, maybe 35. 

14:23.760 --> 14:25.720
- For two positions?
- Yeah. 

14:25.760 --> 14:27.200
I waited three hours. 

14:27.220 --> 14:31.330
But then they told us they'd filled
the jobs, and we should go home. 

14:31.370 --> 14:34.860
- Not a lot of work for drivers right now. 
- Yeah. 

14:34.890 --> 14:37.080
Okay, well, I'll... I'll
make some more calls.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.180
Maybe we can get you something
temporary to tide you over. 

14:39.210 --> 14:41.410
- Okay. Thanks. 
- No problem. 

14:41.440 --> 14:44.830
But, uh, in the meantime, I'll help your
crew file for their unemployment benefits,

14:44.870 --> 14:46.420
'cause those checks take
a while to come through. 

14:46.460 --> 14:47.760
Yeah, I know. 

14:47.790 --> 14:50.090
Pedro, I'm so sorry about all of this. 

14:50.110 --> 14:54.290
Ah, listen, a lot of people
here are worse off than I am. 

14:55.670 --> 14:57.920
I'll call you as soon as I know anything. 

14:57.950 --> 14:59.330
Thanks. 

15:03.860 --> 15:06.310
Hey. 

15:06.340 --> 15:09.830
So... I, uh, picked you up some yogurt. 

15:09.860 --> 15:11.940
But I couldn't remember if
you liked double chocolate

15:11.970 --> 15:14.030
- or the chocolate chocolate... 
- Thank you. 

15:14.060 --> 15:15.630
So I got you both. 

15:15.670 --> 15:16.970
What, is stuff still crazy at Ojai?

15:17.010 --> 15:19.690
Oh, you have no idea. 

15:19.720 --> 15:21.560
What is that, your resume?

15:21.600 --> 15:26.140
Yeah. I'm trying to make the two years
that I worked for my mom look like a career. 

15:27.730 --> 15:29.470
Okay, how about this?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.260
Justin, I'm trying to work. 

15:31.290 --> 15:37.350
What if I were to say that I have an
idea that does not involve a resume?

15:37.380 --> 15:39.740
I'd say I'm listening. 

15:39.770 --> 15:42.620
Okay, hear me out. 

15:42.650 --> 15:45.000
This group on campus is
recruiting med students

15:45.030 --> 15:48.140
to go to Haiti for a year to help out,

15:48.170 --> 15:50.180
and, Rebecca, I think this
would be awesome for us. 

15:50.200 --> 15:53.940
I... I could go help people that are
suffering right now and not in seven years,

15:53.970 --> 15:56.560
and, you know, with Ojai
closing, you can come with me. 

15:56.590 --> 15:58.140
And, you know, you said you wanted
to get back into photography,

15:58.180 --> 16:00.430
so you could take pictures and...
and sort of document the whole thing,

16:00.460 --> 16:04.130
which would then be you helping, too. 

16:04.160 --> 16:06.420
There's my sales pitch. So... 

16:06.460 --> 16:08.550
It's your turn to talk. 

16:11.790 --> 16:13.370
Justin, listen, I know... I know that

16:13.420 --> 16:14.830
medical school wasn't
everything that you wanted... 

16:14.860 --> 16:15.890
Oh, no, no, it's a sabbatical. 

16:15.920 --> 16:17.960
I would actually get credit for...
for hands-on experience down there,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.980
so the timing of it is perfect. 

16:20.020 --> 16:23.380
- Not all the timing. 
- What does that mean?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.750
Justin, I want to talk about
this, but I... I have, um,

16:25.790 --> 16:28.450
a second-round interview
for this new job. 

16:28.480 --> 16:29.810
Second round?

16:29.830 --> 16:31.390
When was I gonna hear
about the first round?

16:31.430 --> 16:34.460
Apparently, when I heard about Haiti. 

16:37.140 --> 16:38.510
Justin, listen... 

16:38.550 --> 16:44.280
I... I do love photography and...
and Haiti would be incredible, but...

16:44.320 --> 16:46.490
I like what I'm doing. 

16:46.510 --> 16:49.880
This is my career, and let's face
it... a year is a really long time.

16:49.910 --> 16:53.010
How... how come I feel like
you already made up your mind?

16:53.050 --> 16:56.980
Justin, that's not fair. You can't just
spring this on me and expect me to... 

16:57.010 --> 16:58.800
- to say yes immediately. 
- You know what?

16:58.830 --> 17:02.130
Thanks for considering it for
all of 20 seconds, Rebecca. 

17:06.010 --> 17:09.560
Is there anything good about
working at Ojai you remember?

17:09.579 --> 17:16.030
Okay. Well, you know, I wasn't as close
to dad as Tommy or your mom was, so

17:16.069 --> 17:17.750
I never worked here as a kid. 

17:17.770 --> 17:20.510
And I just assumed dad didn't... 

17:20.540 --> 17:22.760
want me to. 

17:22.790 --> 17:28.920
Anyway, uh, about a month after
I got out of law school, he... 

17:28.950 --> 17:32.680
He called me and asked me
to look over a contract. 

17:32.710 --> 17:37.340
A way for him to get free
legal advice. I don't know. 

17:37.370 --> 17:40.210
But for me... 

17:43.400 --> 17:46.640
Did it make you happy?

17:51.080 --> 17:53.740
I don't know that I've... 

17:53.760 --> 17:56.870
been so proud... 

17:56.900 --> 18:00.000
before or since. 

18:01.290 --> 18:03.840
I know you're trying to do the
best you can for your employees,

18:03.870 --> 18:06.210
but my answer hasn't changed. I'm sorry. 

18:06.240 --> 18:11.130
- Okay, what if I sweeten the deal?
- I'm listening. 

18:12.290 --> 18:14.880
Would you hire my loaders and my drivers

18:14.910 --> 18:19.140
- if I sign over three semis to you?
- In a word, yes. 

18:19.170 --> 18:22.150
Okay, then. We got a deal. 
Thanks, Sergio. I'll be in touch. 

18:23.550 --> 18:25.960
What are you doing here?

18:27.330 --> 18:31.700
You left this morning without
breakfast, or even saying good-bye. 

18:31.740 --> 18:37.510
So it's time for croissant,
pain au chocolat, grapes... 

18:37.540 --> 18:38.570
a nice little breakfast. 

18:38.600 --> 18:41.280
Listen, don't... don't be mad.
My stomach's all knotted up.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.760
I can't face the thought of food. 

18:42.790 --> 18:47.440
You know on top of everything, my mother is
furious at me, because she's gotten all... 

18:47.470 --> 18:50.730
Sentimental about this building
at the worst possible time?

18:50.770 --> 18:55.130
Well, with all the change going on, I'm sure she's
looking for something solid to hold on to, so... 

18:55.160 --> 18:57.500
Maybe, but I've got to be practical. 

18:57.540 --> 19:01.260
I... I don't have the luxury of
getting attached to a building.

19:01.290 --> 19:04.230
Anyway, the... the only thing
that really matter to me... 

19:04.260 --> 19:06.620
You eating food, okay?

19:06.650 --> 19:08.780
Come here. 

19:10.350 --> 19:13.260
I don't suppose coffee counts. 

19:13.300 --> 19:14.990
No. Sorry. 

19:16.430 --> 19:18.490
I can't believe Sarah is doing this. 

19:18.520 --> 19:20.890
We have to sell the
building. We have no choice. 

19:20.930 --> 19:24.060
It's like no one else's opinion matters. 

19:24.090 --> 19:27.460
Tommy, Tommy, do you
think getting top dollar

19:27.490 --> 19:30.690
should be the only criteria
for choosing a buyer?

19:30.730 --> 19:33.010
Mom... it's just a building. 

19:33.050 --> 19:34.780
It's not just a building. 

19:34.820 --> 19:37.000
It's our history. 

19:37.030 --> 19:38.150
It's... 

19:38.190 --> 19:40.100
it's my... 

19:40.140 --> 19:41.710
history. 

19:41.740 --> 19:44.830
God, Sarah was just a baby. 
She wasn't even walking yet. 

19:44.870 --> 19:47.690
And your father and I worked
on those plans together,

19:47.730 --> 19:49.970
for months and months and months. 

19:50.000 --> 19:51.690
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 

19:51.730 --> 19:53.360
Plans. 

19:53.390 --> 19:55.620
The designer of those
plans was Roger Grant. 

19:55.650 --> 19:57.040
Yeah, and he lives in London. 

19:57.070 --> 20:00.160
No, he's here now. I
read it in the "Times. "

20:00.320 --> 20:02.030
Maybe he'll buy the
building. You never know. 

20:02.070 --> 20:06.120
Mom, there's no way he's gonna pay what
the parking lot people are offering. 

20:06.160 --> 20:10.910
Look, the parking lot
is not going to happen. 

20:10.940 --> 20:13.810
I used to have his cell phone
number. I used to have his... 

20:13.840 --> 20:15.820
See, look. You don't even have his number. 

20:15.850 --> 20:19.680
I slept with the man, for God
sakes. I've got his number. 

20:19.710 --> 20:21.100
Okay, I've got... all right... 

20:21.130 --> 20:23.680
Look, mom, just be careful, all right?

20:23.700 --> 20:26.840
Oh, don't be silly. I'm not in the
least bit interested in Roger Grant. 

20:26.880 --> 20:28.740
I'm talking about Sarah. 

20:28.770 --> 20:30.380
I've never seen her like this. 

20:30.410 --> 20:33.780
Mom, maybe this is the
wrong time to pick a fight. 

20:33.800 --> 20:35.810
I'm not picking a fight. 

20:35.840 --> 20:39.680
I'm trying to save a piece of us. 

20:39.710 --> 20:43.190
Look, Tommy, maybe it isn't
important to you or Sarah right now,

20:43.230 --> 20:46.030
but someday it might be. 

20:46.060 --> 20:48.140
Hello, Roger?

20:48.170 --> 20:51.150
Hi. It's me, Nora. 

20:54.270 --> 20:56.260
So imagine it, okay?

20:56.290 --> 21:00.410
Right at the top there, the two
towers will connect via a skywalk... 

21:00.450 --> 21:02.500
- A skywalk?
- Up on the 70th floor. 

21:02.530 --> 21:06.090
Oh, the s... that has got
to be one hell of a view. 

21:06.120 --> 21:09.860
Yeah, if the permits take any longer, I'll
be doing this project from well above that. 

21:09.890 --> 21:13.390
Oh, Roger, stop. Don't talk
like that. You're not old. 

21:13.420 --> 21:15.040
And besides... 

21:15.070 --> 21:18.720
anything that good is...
is worth waiting for.

21:18.750 --> 21:20.350
Yeah. 

21:20.390 --> 21:22.900
Look, I... I'm sorry I,
um, I couldn't do dinner.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.070
- It's just that we have to... 
- It's all right. 

21:24.100 --> 21:25.740
Fly out this evening... 

21:25.760 --> 21:26.530
Kristin and I, and... ah. 

21:26.560 --> 21:29.580
Is... is... is that your assistant or... 

21:29.610 --> 21:30.920
or someone you're seeing?

21:30.950 --> 21:32.190
Yeah, the... the latter. 

21:32.220 --> 21:35.730
She has us off on this fitness
retreat, starting tomorrow. 

21:35.760 --> 21:39.260
Yeah, she's the instructor,
and it should be great. 

21:39.300 --> 21:42.170
Why do you look so pained?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.590
Well, I... 

21:43.630 --> 21:46.670
I feel bad, Nora. I should've
mentioned her before. 

21:46.710 --> 21:49.470
No. I... I'm the one that
should've said something.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.300
I think my being mysterious might have... 

21:52.350 --> 21:54.610
Might have confused things. 

21:54.640 --> 21:57.780
Actually, it's... 

21:57.810 --> 22:00.610
It's Ojai Foods. 

22:00.650 --> 22:03.030
- Roger, we're shutting down. 
- Wow. 

22:04.380 --> 22:06.610
I'm sorry about that. 

22:06.650 --> 22:09.370
That must be a tremendous loss, I'm sure. 

22:09.400 --> 22:12.310
Well, I'm so glad you feel that
way, because I...  was thinking,

22:12.350 --> 22:14.580
our... our building is
one of the first buildings

22:14.630 --> 22:16.260
- you ever designed. 
- Well, the very first. 

22:16.290 --> 22:17.940
The first. That's perfect. 

22:17.960 --> 22:21.870
I think you're gonna love
this idea, Roger. I... 

22:21.910 --> 22:23.150
I think you should buy the building. 

22:23.170 --> 22:25.440
And then you could keep
it... it safe and...

22:25.490 --> 22:28.670
and protect it from any horrible
person wanting to tear it down. 

22:28.710 --> 22:31.190
Are you kidding? I'd
pay someone to do that. 

22:31.220 --> 22:32.490
- What?
- Look, Nora, I'm... 

22:32.520 --> 22:37.080
I'm glad the building has been home to
your wonderful business for many years, but

22:37.120 --> 22:40.000
it's never gonna make the
Roger Grant architectural tour. 

22:40.030 --> 22:42.870
I mean, it's just a pastiche of
all the other buildings downtown. 

22:42.910 --> 22:45.250
I was, you know, I was copying
other buildings back then. 

22:45.280 --> 22:49.520
The truth is, I'm... I'm more
interested in where I've gotten to. 

22:50.310 --> 22:52.010
Oh. Oh, yes. 

22:52.040 --> 22:54.760
Ahh, yes, yes, yes. I... 

22:54.800 --> 23:00.560
I see. You are now into newer, younger... 

23:00.590 --> 23:03.860
More modern designs... sleek and smooth. 

23:03.900 --> 23:05.480
Ah, yes, that's perfectly clear. 

23:05.520 --> 23:08.900
You know, I... I had no idea that you'd
take my dating a younger woman so personally.

23:08.940 --> 23:11.460
Oh, Roger, I don't give a
rat's ass about your girlfriend. 

23:11.500 --> 23:14.830
It's the disdain you have for
your own history that bothers me. 

23:14.870 --> 23:18.360
You just want to plaster over all
the imperfections in your career,

23:18.400 --> 23:21.340
as if you could just
botox your whole past away.

23:21.370 --> 23:24.880
Look, I don't love my wrinkles and
I'm certainly not fond of my neck,

23:24.920 --> 23:27.380
but I'm not ashamed of
them. They are who I am. 

23:27.410 --> 23:29.660
It's a record of the life I've lived. 

23:29.680 --> 23:33.480
Our building is humble
and simple, and I love it. 

23:33.520 --> 23:37.030
And I'm just so sorry
for you that you don't. 

23:37.060 --> 23:39.770
- Thank you for the coffee. 
- Pleasure. 

23:43.370 --> 23:48.310
I'm Holly Harper,
co-president of Ojai Foods. 

23:48.990 --> 23:50.890
So... 

23:50.930 --> 23:52.830
You were my grandfather's girlfriend?

23:52.870 --> 23:54.290
Paige. 

23:54.330 --> 23:55.470
- That's not very appropriate. 
- No, Saul... 

23:55.500 --> 23:56.480
- Sorry. 
- It's okay. 

23:56.510 --> 24:00.340
No, Paige, you can

24:00.380 --> 24:04.000
did that make it weird to work here?

24:04.030 --> 24:06.260
Sometimes. 

24:06.290 --> 24:09.070
Uh, like now, for instance, but... 

24:09.100 --> 24:11.610
Oh, look, look, it's
your, uh, Aunt Rebecca. 

24:11.640 --> 24:13.980
Hey, I'm so sorry to interrupt. 
I just have some really good news. 

24:14.010 --> 24:15.480
What is it, sweetie?

24:15.520 --> 24:21.700
Okay, you guys are looking at the new associate
vice president of Maddox Thompson Foods. 

24:21.730 --> 24:23.130
Maddox Thompson?

24:24.010 --> 24:25.950
I... I... that's wonderful.

24:25.980 --> 24:29.230
I know. I'm shocked. Apparently,
they interviewed a lot of people, too. 

24:29.270 --> 24:31.190
W... w... well, why be shocked?

24:31.220 --> 24:34.660
They are lucky to have you. 

24:36.470 --> 24:38.980
That's all great. Thank you. 

24:40.470 --> 24:41.550
Hey, Pedro. What's up?

24:41.580 --> 24:44.440
Great news. We're going
over to Sergio Acosta...

24:44.480 --> 24:46.730
all of us... starting next week. 

24:46.770 --> 24:49.440
That's amazing. What...
this is such great news.

24:49.470 --> 24:51.850
The last I heard, Sergio
wasn't hiring at all. 

24:51.890 --> 24:53.690
He said he talked to Sarah about us. 

24:53.730 --> 24:55.840
You should give him a call. Maybe
there's openings for other people. 

24:55.880 --> 24:59.290
Yeah, of course. I'm... I'm so
happy for you. Congratulations. 

24:59.320 --> 25:01.150
Thanks. I gotta go home and tell my wife. 

25:01.180 --> 25:02.720
Yeah, of course. 

25:06.600 --> 25:09.090
When we started Ojai Foods,

25:09.140 --> 25:12.380
your grandfather and I, I was in my 20s. 

25:12.410 --> 25:15.780
And aside from a brief stab at retirement,

25:15.820 --> 25:20.090
I have spent every day of my
working life at Ojai Foods. 

25:20.120 --> 25:21.290
Yeah. 

25:21.310 --> 25:23.650
And it's been a very
satisfying job... you know,

25:23.680 --> 25:27.850
giving nourishment to people,
feeding them, filling them up. 

25:27.880 --> 25:31.040
And I guess if you're lucky
enough, it can work both ways. 

25:31.080 --> 25:33.210
Your job can nourish you,

25:33.250 --> 25:36.160
can enrich your life. 

25:36.200 --> 25:38.040
And I have been very lucky. 

25:38.080 --> 25:39.280
I... I...

25:39.310 --> 25:42.940
I have gotten to work
with people that I love. 

25:44.350 --> 25:47.410
But there is a danger to it, I suppose. 

25:47.450 --> 25:51.660
When you don't have children,
when... when you're single like I am,

25:51.680 --> 25:56.200
you can rely on your job to give
you more than it actually can. 

25:56.240 --> 26:00.190
It becomes so much a
part of you, that you... 

26:00.230 --> 26:03.270
You can't imagine life without it... 

26:03.310 --> 26:05.120
Yeah... 

26:05.150 --> 26:08.580
without that place to go to every day. 

26:11.400 --> 26:12.480
Have you guys seen Rebecca?

26:12.510 --> 26:14.490
Yeah, it was her turn to
get interviewed by Paige. 

26:14.530 --> 26:18.200
My daughter is making a film
of the worst week of my life. 

26:18.240 --> 26:20.710
Yeah, you know what? We should
do something for Rebecca. 

26:20.740 --> 26:24.180
At this point, any good news
is reason for celebration. 

26:24.200 --> 26:25.730
What good news?

26:25.770 --> 26:27.810
Way to go, bro. Spoil the surprise. 

26:27.840 --> 26:29.620
You know that job she was up for?

26:29.650 --> 26:31.130
She got it, at Maddox Thompson. 

26:31.160 --> 26:33.690
Oh, yeah. Employment's way up. 

26:33.720 --> 26:36.840
I just spoke to Sergio Acosta
to thank him for hiring Pedro

26:36.870 --> 26:38.120
and see if he had any more openings. 

26:38.160 --> 26:39.340
Why don't you seem happy about that?

26:39.370 --> 26:41.780
- Oh, why don't you tell him, Sarah?
- I had to do it. 

26:41.810 --> 26:44.020
You can't give away company assets. 

26:44.050 --> 26:46.220
Hold on. What... what's going on here?

26:46.260 --> 26:47.830
Just a little embezzlement by our sister. 

26:47.870 --> 26:49.470
Oh, it's not embezzlement. Come on, Kevin. 

26:49.510 --> 26:50.630
Don't kid yourself. 

26:50.660 --> 26:53.060
Just 'cause you think it's a good cause,
that doesn't make it right or legal. 

26:53.100 --> 26:54.930
Hold on. What did you give away?

26:54.960 --> 26:58.150
She gave $100,000 to
Sergio Acosta in trucks. 

26:58.190 --> 27:00.290
You just gave him company trucks?

27:00.320 --> 27:02.510
He assured me that he would hire our crew. 

27:02.550 --> 27:04.870
Are you nuts? They
don't even belong to you. 

27:04.900 --> 27:06.890
No, they belong to the
company, and the company failed,

27:06.930 --> 27:08.290
and that's why these
people are out of work. 

27:08.320 --> 27:10.420
So the company can take the damn hit. 

27:10.450 --> 27:11.450
I know what I'm doing. 

27:11.490 --> 27:13.960
I don't think you have
any idea what you're doing. 

27:13.990 --> 27:16.150
How are you gonna account for
the trucks? They flew away?

27:16.180 --> 27:18.570
- I was gonna pay for them myself. 
- Really? How?

27:18.610 --> 27:20.950
I was gonna sell my house, okay?

27:20.990 --> 27:23.220
Sarah... listen to yourself. 

27:23.250 --> 27:25.870
I mean, you are so far over
the line, you don't even see it. 

27:25.900 --> 27:27.990
These people are my responsibility. 

27:28.020 --> 27:32.280
When you were up in Seattle, I had to live with
my inability to save this company every day. 

27:32.310 --> 27:34.480
And it's not their fault. It is my fault. 

27:34.520 --> 27:38.140
It is my fault, and I am trying to fix it. 

27:38.180 --> 27:40.950
Sarah. Sarah, stop. 

27:43.600 --> 27:47.180
I'm sorry you didn't have
your camera with you, Paige. 

27:47.210 --> 27:52.160
You could've got the real
story about the end of Ojai. 

28:01.290 --> 28:03.740
"Have you ever noticed that the
Democrats blame the Republicans"... 

28:03.780 --> 28:06.370
You know, I can pour you one
of your own if you'd like. 

28:06.410 --> 28:09.030
Oh, yeah, that would be great.
As soon as I finish yours.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.590
I swear. I do not know how
you do this all the time. 

28:12.620 --> 28:14.430
I feel like I actually might vomit. 

28:14.460 --> 28:18.550
Okay, look, you're just gonna breathe
deeply and make sure your knees don't lock. 

28:18.580 --> 28:20.630
- Hey. 
- Hey. 

28:20.660 --> 28:23.160
Hey. Kev, what are you doing?

28:23.200 --> 28:24.600
Kevin, you're... you're...
you're not dressed.

28:24.630 --> 28:26.260
We have to leave in, like, 30 seconds. 

28:26.300 --> 28:29.810
I know. Sarah had a meltdown,
and it's pretty bad over there. 

28:29.840 --> 28:33.160
Well, i... is she okay? I mean,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

28:33.200 --> 28:37.410
Is this a... is this a... a real
meltdown or a Sarah meltdown?

28:38.850 --> 28:42.240
I'm saying, I really
should get back there. 

28:42.270 --> 28:45.100
Yeah. Yeah. No, I... I... 

28:45.130 --> 28:47.330
I think that I should come with you. 

28:47.370 --> 28:49.890
I think that Sarah is really
going to need my moral support. 

28:49.920 --> 28:56.200
And besides, she likes me a lot better
than she likes you. So, um... Robert... 

28:56.240 --> 28:58.870
You really think you should
blow off the gold rush dinner?

28:58.910 --> 29:00.450
'cause I think it's kind of important. 

29:00.480 --> 29:03.470
No. It's all about small
businesses and family. 

29:03.500 --> 29:06.980
I think I have the perfect
excuse, and besides, you're... 

29:08.710 --> 29:10.940
You're funnier than I am. 

29:10.980 --> 29:11.590
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

29:11.630 --> 29:14.420
- I said you're funnier than I am. 
- That's true. 

29:14.950 --> 29:19.060
- You can use my jokes if you want. 
- Oh, absolutely. 

29:20.450 --> 29:22.300
Okay. Let's go. 

29:30.030 --> 29:32.470
Oh, God. I hope that
isn't a peace offering. 

29:32.500 --> 29:34.520
It's me that owes you. 

29:35.600 --> 29:37.330
No. 

29:37.360 --> 29:39.840
I... I went by the office. 

29:41.150 --> 29:43.640
Tommy told me what happened. 

29:43.680 --> 29:46.140
Yeah. Um... 

29:46.170 --> 29:48.230
I really screwed up, mom. 

29:48.270 --> 29:50.810
Okay, you made some mistakes. 

29:50.850 --> 29:52.210
Uh, that's an understatement. 

29:52.250 --> 29:55.940
God, who are you that you think
you're so important and superhuman

29:55.970 --> 29:58.360
that you're the only one that
could've saved the company?

29:58.380 --> 30:00.660
But I didn't save it, did I? So... 

30:00.700 --> 30:02.110
Look, I know how badly you feel. 

30:02.150 --> 30:04.990
But you push me away, you
push Tommy and Kevin away. 

30:05.030 --> 30:06.700
It's like you have to suffer alone,

30:06.740 --> 30:09.570
like your disappointment
is so much worse than ours. 

30:09.600 --> 30:11.510
It's not disappointment, mom. 

30:11.550 --> 30:13.830
It's shame. 

30:14.410 --> 30:17.030
And I failed... 

30:17.060 --> 30:19.230
Completely. 

30:19.270 --> 30:21.400
I am just... 

30:21.430 --> 30:25.650
- Trying to work out how I live with it. 
- Oh, sweetheart. 

30:27.990 --> 30:31.600
Sweetheart, I know what failure is. 

30:31.630 --> 30:33.810
But as hard as it is... 

30:33.850 --> 30:37.240
I think you have to lean
in to those feelings. 

30:37.280 --> 30:40.130
You haven't had much
failure in your life, Sarah. 

30:40.170 --> 30:42.880
It takes practice to get good at it. 

30:42.920 --> 30:45.530
It hurts like holy hell. 

30:45.560 --> 30:50.400
But it's important. It's the door
that will lead you to your future. 

30:50.440 --> 30:53.570
I just don't know how to do that. 

30:53.610 --> 30:56.290
That's not who I am. 

30:58.460 --> 31:01.790
You see? I'm a failure at failure. 

31:01.820 --> 31:03.840
No, honey. 

31:03.880 --> 31:08.600
I... I think you're being
spectacularly successful at failure. 

31:12.130 --> 31:14.040
Oh, mama. 

31:14.080 --> 31:18.050
Oh, honey. Oh, sweetheart. 

31:22.290 --> 31:25.250
Hey. So I just got off the
phone with Maddox Thompson. 

31:25.290 --> 31:28.770
They wanted to apologize for not telling me you
were up for the same job that I interviewed for. 

31:28.810 --> 31:31.640
I know. They called me, too. 
They were really embarrassed. 

31:31.670 --> 31:34.780
Mom, this is so unfair. You're
ten times more qualified than I am. 

31:34.810 --> 31:36.620
I'm not gonna take this
knowing that you deserve it. 

31:36.650 --> 31:41.390
Don't even think about
turning that job down. 

31:41.430 --> 31:44.460
Okay, it stung a little. 

31:44.500 --> 31:47.460
But it's a much better fit for
you than it would've been for me. 

31:47.490 --> 31:48.740
I just feel horrible. 

31:48.780 --> 31:51.450
No, sweetie. I will be fine. 

31:51.490 --> 31:54.420
And I will find another job. 

31:54.460 --> 31:55.710
Actually... 

31:55.750 --> 32:00.310
the only bright spot in this terrible day

32:00.340 --> 32:05.110
is knowing that you're going
off on this whole new adventure. 

32:05.140 --> 32:07.590
Really. 

32:10.710 --> 32:14.920
We were cleaning out the old
desks the other day, and, uh... 

32:14.960 --> 32:17.510
I found this. 

32:18.270 --> 32:21.420
Walker and son fine produce. 

32:21.990 --> 32:25.380
I made a bunch of these when I was a kid. 

32:27.800 --> 32:31.770
I, uh... went to show dad, and
he said that, uh, "that's right. 

32:31.810 --> 32:33.980
Someday, it will be. "

32:36.460 --> 32:40.430
But unfortunately, he was wrong. 

32:40.470 --> 32:43.080
"Walker and Son and Daughter"... it, uh,

32:43.130 --> 32:45.920
doesn't have the same ring. 

32:47.520 --> 32:51.780
He was right to bring
Sarah into the business. 

32:51.820 --> 32:58.230
If I hadn't have worked so hard to
try to prove him wrong every day... 

32:58.940 --> 33:03.040
Things might be different for, uh... 

33:03.070 --> 33:05.130
for everybody. 

33:06.510 --> 33:08.830
You know, you never told
me what was in this box. 

33:08.840 --> 33:12.430
Because I don't know what is in that
box. They gave it to me at the office. 

33:12.460 --> 33:15.280
It's from Roger Grant. 

33:15.310 --> 33:17.000
Oh, my God. 

33:17.020 --> 33:19.190
Sarah, I... I wanted to tell you... 

33:19.220 --> 33:24.160
I... I tried to convince
him to buy our building. 

33:24.190 --> 33:27.960
It didn't work. He was not
in the least bit interested. 

33:28.000 --> 33:29.450
Open it. 

33:30.910 --> 33:36.360
"Some women and some buildings are
classic. Thank you for reminding me. 

33:37.060 --> 33:39.930
I thought you might enjoy
these original drawings

33:39.960 --> 33:42.590
I did for William when
we were all very young. "

33:42.620 --> 33:44.970
That's so sweet. 

33:45.000 --> 33:47.140
Oh, Sarah. 

33:50.610 --> 33:53.680
Oh, my goodness. 

33:54.550 --> 33:58.590
Oh, look. "Ojai Foods offices. "

33:58.630 --> 34:01.960
Oh, you know, these have all been
done by hand. Nobody does this anymore. 

34:04.140 --> 34:07.550
Oh. There used to be a clock tower. 

34:07.590 --> 34:09.949
Yeah. Oh, William nixed that right away. 

34:09.989 --> 34:12.620
He said he didn't want a
clock ticking over his head,

34:12.659 --> 34:16.409
reminding him how fast
the fruit was rotting. 

34:18.550 --> 34:20.420
What is this other... 

34:20.449 --> 34:23.150
Oh, my God. mom. 

34:26.010 --> 34:27.489
Sarah. 

34:27.530 --> 34:30.889
Dad was gonna build
something at narrow Lake. 

34:30.920 --> 34:33.239
A house. 

34:33.270 --> 34:34.949
Why the heck didn't he tell me?

34:34.980 --> 34:39.080
Because it was... 
supposed to be a surprise. 

34:39.110 --> 34:40.980
Or maybe he wasn't building it for me. 

34:41.010 --> 34:43.270
Mom, it's an anagram of your name. 

34:43.300 --> 34:45.290
Of course it was for you. 

34:45.330 --> 34:48.540
Well, now I am... I'm really confused. 

34:48.570 --> 34:53.600
Why would Dennis York want the land
where William was gonna build a house?

34:53.639 --> 34:56.000
I have no idea. 

34:56.030 --> 34:59.150
Look at this... "Nora's art studio,

34:59.180 --> 35:01.570
"Nora's sewing room. "

35:01.600 --> 35:04.840
Over here,"Nora's bathroom"
on the second floor. 

35:04.860 --> 35:08.030
I can't believe he was
gonna build me a house. 

35:08.060 --> 35:11.030
This is more than a house, mom. 

35:11.060 --> 35:13.420
This is a love letter. 

35:13.450 --> 35:16.460
He really loved you. 

35:16.490 --> 35:21.580
You're allowed to lean in
to those feelings, you know?

35:24.110 --> 35:26.940
Yes. 

35:26.980 --> 35:29.520
I guess he did. 

35:36.120 --> 35:37.990
Nice job out there. 

35:38.030 --> 35:39.470
You were very funny. 

35:39.500 --> 35:43.180
Well, thanks. They're a friendly group. 

35:44.500 --> 35:48.310
Sorry Kitty couldn't make it tonight. 
I was looking forward to meeting her. 

35:48.340 --> 35:51.190
I think it's best if we keep
our relationship to ourselves. 

35:51.220 --> 35:53.290
Yeah, I thought so, too. 

35:53.320 --> 35:57.080
That's why I was so surprised to hear
that you'd been talking to Rawling... 

35:57.120 --> 36:00.980
a lot. What was your plan?

36:01.020 --> 36:02.930
Were you taping our conversations?

36:02.960 --> 36:05.170
And who were you reporting
to besides Joe Rawling?

36:05.200 --> 36:06.950
You are misinformed. 

36:06.980 --> 36:10.470
I'm very thorough when it
comes to a $1-billion contract. 

36:10.500 --> 36:12.740
My conversation with
Rawling had nothing to do... 

36:12.770 --> 36:14.410
here's the deal... 

36:14.440 --> 36:16.750
you walk back your plan with Rawling

36:16.780 --> 36:19.200
and you destroy whatever
evidence you've collected,

36:19.240 --> 36:21.620
or I'll use every ounce
of influence I've got

36:21.660 --> 36:25.900
to make sure your wife couldn't
get elected dog catcher. 

36:25.930 --> 36:29.150
Good night, Senator. 

36:29.190 --> 36:31.980
Say hello to Kitty for me. 

36:34.240 --> 36:37.500
I can't believe they're
valuing dad's desk at 30 bucks. 

36:37.530 --> 36:38.500
Well, look at it. 

36:38.530 --> 36:40.990
I don't think it's worth
anything to anyone but us. 

36:41.030 --> 36:43.840
Do you remember that wood burning
kit you got me when I was 10?

36:43.880 --> 36:46.250
Yes, I do, because you went
around burning your initials

36:46.280 --> 36:49.470
into every wooden object you came near. 

36:50.670 --> 36:52.210
I was staking my claim early. 

36:52.240 --> 36:55.140
You know what, sweetheart? I think
that you should have this desk. 

36:55.180 --> 36:56.630
Your father would've wanted you to. 

36:56.660 --> 36:57.460
- Hey. 
- Hey. 

36:57.510 --> 37:02.119
Hi. W... what about your event?

37:02.120 --> 37:05.320
Oh, I decided to let Robert
cover for me. I... is Sarah here?

37:05.350 --> 37:07.250
- She's on her way. 
- Is she okay?

37:07.280 --> 37:09.790
No, but I think she will be. 

37:09.820 --> 37:10.990
Come here. Look at you. 

37:11.010 --> 37:12.910
- Oh, hi. 
- Oh, you, you look gorgeous. 

37:12.940 --> 37:14.790
God, this is such an amazing space. 

37:14.820 --> 37:16.710
Someone could renovate
it and turn it into lofts. 

37:16.740 --> 37:19.290
Oh, honey, honey, um,
could you please shut up?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.950
- Oh... 
- That's all right. That's all right. 

37:20.980 --> 37:22.440
I'm... I'm reconciled. 

37:24.420 --> 37:27.370
I'm glad you came back. I wanted
to talk to you about something. 

37:27.400 --> 37:29.590
If this is about you getting
that new job, I already know. 

37:29.620 --> 37:32.410
- And?
- And we gotta figure this out. 

37:32.450 --> 37:34.230
Because this is serious. 

37:34.260 --> 37:38.250
I... I feel like we're miles apart in
where we want to be with our lives, Rebecca. 

37:38.300 --> 37:39.990
I didn't even know you
were interested in this job. 

37:40.020 --> 37:41.260
You don't even know what the job is. 

37:41.300 --> 37:42.940
Okay. Well, tell me about it. 

37:42.970 --> 37:45.700
Is everything okay with you two?

37:45.730 --> 37:47.930
Uh, yeah, yeah. It's fine. 

37:47.960 --> 37:50.370
Oh, my God. W... what... 

37:51.120 --> 37:52.300
Kitty?

37:52.330 --> 37:53.760
What happened to your dinner?

37:53.800 --> 37:58.190
Oh, I just decided to take pity on the
audience and let Robert cover for me. 

37:58.230 --> 38:00.890
We just all wanted to be here. 

38:01.470 --> 38:05.270
Well, um, I... I'm glad you
are all here because, um,

38:05.310 --> 38:08.140
you know, there's a couple of things
that I've... I've wanted to say. 

38:08.170 --> 38:11.220
Um, the first is, I hope
you can all forgive me. 

38:11.250 --> 38:12.970
You have to stop. 

38:13.000 --> 38:15.660
- Sarah, come on. 
- Okay, okay. 

38:15.700 --> 38:20.100
Uh, well, second is, we all know
dad was an Irish whiskey man. 

38:20.140 --> 38:21.470
Um... 

38:21.510 --> 38:24.240
I always kept a bottle at the
house in case he stopped by. 

38:24.270 --> 38:26.860
I'm kind of hoping that
you could help me finish it. 

38:26.900 --> 38:28.880
- That's a great idea!
- Mom!

38:28.920 --> 38:30.730
Okay. 

38:30.760 --> 38:32.230
That is something I'm actually good at. 

38:32.260 --> 38:34.350
- Uh, cups, cups. 
- Choppy-choppy, get the cups. 

38:34.390 --> 38:37.970
You know, um, I still have to
fix up that whole truck mess. 

38:38.000 --> 38:40.600
No, no, you don't. I spoke
with Pedro this afternoon. 

38:40.630 --> 38:42.380
Oh, God. I've gotta
call him and apologize. 

38:42.410 --> 38:45.600
No, you don't, at all, because... 

38:45.630 --> 38:47.970
he actually wants to
buy the trucks himself. 

38:48.010 --> 38:49.490
He and his brother, they
want to go into business. 

38:49.520 --> 38:51.170
And, you know, they want to
take some of the crew with them,

38:51.200 --> 38:53.370
so I showed 'em how to get
a small business loan... 

38:53.410 --> 38:54.630
- Yeah?
- And they're ecstatic. 

38:54.660 --> 38:56.030
Kevin, that's wonderful. 

38:56.050 --> 38:57.400
Great symmetry, right?

38:57.430 --> 38:59.980
One family business
closes, another one opens. 

39:00.020 --> 39:03.030
Wow. That story actually
makes me want to cry. 

39:03.060 --> 39:04.530
To capitalism. 

39:11.490 --> 39:14.530
I know what we should be drinking to. 

39:14.560 --> 39:16.740
Come on, Sarah. 

39:16.780 --> 39:19.850
No, I think you should do it, Uncle Saul. 

39:28.700 --> 39:30.530
To Ojai. 

39:31.130 --> 39:33.180
To Ojai. 

39:33.210 --> 39:35.990
To Ojai. 

39:46.560 --> 39:48.300
Wow. This is a first. 

39:48.340 --> 39:50.230
What?

39:50.260 --> 39:53.110
This family speechless. 

40:04.010 --> 40:08.950
* Of all the money that e'er I had *

40:08.990 --> 40:14.820
* I spent it  in good company *

40:14.880 --> 40:19.730
* And all the harm that ever I've done *

40:19.780 --> 40:26.500
* Alas it was to none but me

40:26.530 --> 40:30.110
* And all I've done

40:30.140 --> 40:34.140
* For want of wit

40:34.180 --> 40:40.760

* So fill to me

40:43.440 --> 40:46.180
* The parting glass

40:46.220 --> 40:52.510
* Good night and joy be with you all

40:52.550 --> 40:55.660
* But since it falls

40:55.700 --> 40:59.190
* Unto my lot?

40:59.230 --> 41:05.260
* That I should go
And you should not

41:05.290 --> 41:08.730
* I gently rise

41:08.770 --> 41:12.090
* And softly call

41:12.130 --> 41:18.360
* Good night and joy be with you all

41:18.390 --> 41:25.910
* And so it falls unto my lot

41:25.940 --> 41:28.990
* That I should go

41:29.030 --> 41:33.130
* And you should not

41:33.160 --> 41:36.200
* I simply raise

41:36.240 --> 41:39.820
* My glass and call

41:39.860 --> 41:43.230

41:43.270 --> 41:45.790
Good night, Ojai Foods. 

41:46.350 --> 41:50.040
* And all I've done

41:50.080 --> 41:54.400
* For want of wit

41:54.440 --> 42:00.160
* To mem'ry now I can't recall

42:00.930 --> 42:04.300
* So fill to me

42:04.320 --> 42:08.830
* The parting glass

42:08.870 --> 42:17.230
