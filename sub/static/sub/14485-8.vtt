No, I'm not.
I am an even bigger liar
than you.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.292
My career went down the tubes
the day they invented
Smell-A-Vision.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.527
Calculon's gonna
kill us for sure,

15:27.626 --> 15:29.696
and it's all
everybody else's fault.

15:29.796 --> 15:35.501
Oy. All I wanted
was for people to think of me
one last time before I die.

15:35.601 --> 15:40.340
What are you talking about,
Uncle? Everybody
remembers Harold Zoid.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.375
As a pathetic has-been,
they remember me.

15:43.475 --> 15:48.148
As a forgotten relic,
they remember me. Bah!
It's better to die now.

15:48.248 --> 15:52.485
No! This is one death
Dr. Zoidberg won't
be responsible for.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.288
Zoidberg away!

16:01.660 --> 16:04.364
[ Cameras Shuttering ]

16:04.464 --> 16:09.235
Hi. I'm Joan Rivers's head.
I tell you, I've
had so many face-lifts,

16:09.336 --> 16:12.172
they finally lifted it
right off my body.

16:12.272 --> 16:16.509
It's true! It's true!
Oh, oh, oh. Here comes
Jack Nicholson's D.N.A.,

16:16.609 --> 16:18.544
reconstituted
in a gorilla body!

Catering.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.054
Oh-- Ohh.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.725
Oh, and here's
washed-up actor
what's-his-name, Harold Zoid.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.429
Are you presenting one
of those tacky honorary awards
or just getting one?

16:37.529 --> 16:43.036
I'm a seat filler, Joan's head.
My only marketable skill is
to occupy space.

16:43.135 --> 16:47.340
[ Chattering ]

16:47.440 --> 16:51.878
You know, the second
I don't win that award,
you're cat food.

Right, Boxy?

Billy Crystal!

how a Pez dispenser feels.

All right. We're
already one hour behind.
[ Gorilla Grunting ]

17:21.907 --> 17:26.078
Our first award tonight:
best cinematography in
a non-visible spectrum.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.080
[ Rumbling ]

17:28.181 --> 17:32.484
It's been two weeks. You
wanna play tic-tac-toe again
before we eat our shoes?

17:32.585 --> 17:35.822
No. I always knew
I'd die at the bottom
of a pit,

17:35.922 --> 17:39.159
but a pit full of tar?
[ Crashing ]

17:39.259 --> 17:43.130
What was that?
A tar dolphin or a tar shark?

17:43.230 --> 17:46.932
It's some kind
of hollow tube devoid
of human life.

17:47.032 --> 17:51.304
[ Gasps ]
The Los Angeles subway! We can
blast our way in and escape!

17:51.403 --> 17:54.574

- ** [ Theme ]
- What category are they on?

18:00.613 --> 18:04.451
They're giving out
the minor technical awards.
I think they're up to writing.

18:04.550 --> 18:07.987
That just leaves best
soft drink product placement
and then best actor.

18:08.086 --> 18:12.858
- We don't have much time.
- And the nominees for best soft
drink product placement are--

The Pepsi Generation.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.131

in The Magnificent Three.

Shh. Just play along like
they did for Marisa Tomei.

Hooray!
I won't be murdered!
I'll live another day,

19:17.990 --> 19:23.162
another day
of pathetic, forgotten misery.

And the winner is--

19:35.241 --> 19:38.911
And the winner--
instead of any
of the nominees--

19:39.010 --> 19:42.181
is the legendary
Harold Zoid!

Thank you. Thank you so much.
You know, through all my ups
and downs,

I always thought
the most important thing
in life was to win an Oscar,

20:02.501 --> 20:07.473
but tonight I realize
what's really important
is to win two Oscars!

20:07.574 --> 20:11.210
Ha! Ha!
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

20:11.310 --> 20:15.114

is that people care about you,

It's slightly
less fraudulent
for you to have it.

Yes. Yes,
it's a real beauty.

to win one of my own.

gonna kill us, Your Majesty?
