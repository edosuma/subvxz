[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:05.511 --> 00:07.586
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:07.678 --> 00:12.502
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:12.596 --> 00:16.212
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:16.305 --> 00:20.382
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help,
and if you can find them...

00:20.473 --> 00:22.528
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

[Police Radio Chatter,
Low, Indistinct]

02:53.260 --> 02:55.963
- You know how tough it is
to prosecute a cop?
- Cops?

02:56.052 --> 03:00.047
You're not cops. You're killers.
You're murderers killing for money.

03:00.137 --> 03:04.629
I think you'd better
forget that appointment
tomorrow morning with Chief Metcalf.

03:04.721 --> 03:08.668
Hey, Maloney, you"re gonna
pension off in three months.

03:08.764 --> 03:13.256
Don't go out in a tailspin of speculation
and accusations about your fellow officers.

03:13.348 --> 03:17.094
If you thought all I had were accusations,
we wouldn't be standing out here...

03:17.182 --> 03:20.466
talking in the night air,
now, would we?

03:25.601 --> 03:29.548
We're the police.
We protect and we serve.

03:29.644 --> 03:33.473
Anything happened to us,
and who knows what'd happen...

03:33.561 --> 03:37.141
to all those nice,
innocent people out there...

03:37.229 --> 03:40.014
including your wife
and your daughter.

03:42.730 --> 03:46.642
That"s a real rough neighbourhood
by the university downtown.
You wouldn"t want anything to happen...

03:46.731 --> 03:49.303
to a cute little item like that,
now, would you?

03:49.399 --> 03:52.765
Better just forget about that appointment
with the chief tomorrow morning.

03:52.858 --> 03:56.603
But if you don't,
we'll find out about it...

03:56.692 --> 04:01.018
because after all, we're all
on the same team, aren't we?

04:03.194 --> 04:06.109
Goodnight, Maloney.

04:07.611 --> 04:10.017
Let's go.

04:38.119 --> 04:41.034
[Coughing]

04:46.537 --> 04:50.484
- Mick, give me a beer, will ya, please?
- Ed.

04:50.580 --> 04:53.495
My, my. It looks like the problems
of all time are weighin' you down.

04:53.581 --> 04:56.034
Sounds like you haven't
been takin' care of yourself.

04:56.123 --> 05:00.283
[Ed] Will you save the conversation
for the customers who need the analysis
and just give me a beer, huh, please?

05:00.374 --> 05:04.783
Sure. Sure. Your wife called twice
lookin" for ya.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.245
- You gonna be needing some change
for the phone?
- No.

05:11.168 --> 05:13.373
Oh, my. Not you again.

05:13.461 --> 05:15.535
Oh, come on, Mick.

05:15.628 --> 05:19.871
- You can spare a brew for old Kid Shaleen.
- I thought I sent you home an hour ago.

05:19.962 --> 05:24.502
Did I tell you about the time
I knocked down Floyd Patterson?

05:24.588 --> 05:27.622
- Yes, you did, Kid.
- It was in the third...

05:27.714 --> 05:31.709
and he threw his great right hand,
and I saw it, but I ducked.

05:31.798 --> 05:37.749
And I pumped him.
And up I came and down he went.
Did you see that fight?

05:39.300 --> 05:43.046
Of course, he knocked me out.

05:43.134 --> 05:48.800
But Patterson was a great champion,
and I knocked him down.

05:48.886 --> 05:52.880
It must have been a great fight.
Hey, Mick, give him a beer, will ya?

05:54.595 --> 05:58.377
When I was young,
I had all the moves.

05:58.471 --> 06:01.304
Didn't we all, champ?
Didn't we all? [Chuckles]

06:01.389 --> 06:03.878
- Come on.
- Hey, what are you doin'?

06:03.973 --> 06:07.090
I'm Hannibal Smith.
You wanna hire the A-Team?

06:07.182 --> 06:09.718
- The A-Team? Yeah.
- Come on.

06:14.517 --> 06:18.843
Sorry to work things like this, Inspector,
but I'm sure you understand.

06:18.935 --> 06:24.008
You know, I all but gave up on you guys.
I went down to the Long Beach Pier
the other night, like Mr Lee said.

06:24.103 --> 06:28.097
I waited and I waited,
and all I got was a cold. I thought
maybe you didn"t want this job.

06:28.187 --> 06:32.347
- Hey, man, we don't work for no police.
- Then what is this?
What are we doin' here?

06:32.438 --> 06:36.764
Let's say you intrigued us enough
to want to find out if this
is some kind of trap...

06:36.856 --> 06:39.807
if you"re working in conjunction
with the military police.

06:39.898 --> 06:43.727
You think anyone would make up the kind
of story that I told you if they were
trying to trap someone?

06:43.816 --> 06:46.767
Who"d believe there"s a SWA Tteam
out there who are murderers for hire?

06:46.858 --> 06:50.520
It is a crazy story.
That's why we're talkin' to ya.

06:50.609 --> 06:56.061
They were roped in by the leader,
Captain Stark. He managed to
get something big on each one of them.

06:56.152 --> 06:59.234
Then he pulled "em together
and had "em all transferred
to his command.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.686
Now, his SWAT officers, they have
one of the hottest records on the force...

07:02.779 --> 07:07.022
but I know of at least seven killings
they're responsible for while off duty.

07:08.072 --> 07:11.485
Look at this.
They warned me tonight
they'd hurt my wife and daughter...

07:11.572 --> 07:16.444
if I went to Chief Metcalf
with this, but I don"t have any proof
and the chief would never believe me.

07:16.532 --> 07:19.863
- I don't think anyone would believe you.
- It's gotta be some kind of trap, Hannibal.

07:19.949 --> 07:24.442
- This guy"s a cop.
- Now, I been standin" in alleys.
I met your guy at the Chinese laundry.

07:24.534 --> 07:27.865
You pulled me in here,
and for what? Here. Take that.

07:27.951 --> 07:32.859
I brought my money
like the Chinese guy said. And you're right.
I am a cop. And I'm a good cop.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.027
And if I weren"t up against the wall
and knew you guys were wanted...

07:35.120 --> 07:37.324
I would bust your butts
in a flat second.

07:37.412 --> 07:41.241
You know why? Because it's my job.
And so is nailin' those animals.

07:41.330 --> 07:45.241
$ 14,602.

07:45.331 --> 07:50.534
That"s right. That"s all I got.
There"s a bankbook in there
that"ll show you that that"s the truth...

07:50.623 --> 07:55.958
so, uh, what you see there
is every dime that Edward Maloney has.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.289
Now, uh, if you want the job,
you take it.

07:59.376 --> 08:03.205
If you don't, then goodbye and good luck,
and I'll see the chief in the morning.

08:03.293 --> 08:06.825
Without proof, it's your word
against four other officers'.

08:06.919 --> 08:10.499
- And what about your family?
- I'll do what I have to.

08:10.587 --> 08:14.000
I'll take care of them.
I've been a cop too long
to let this one go by.

08:14.087 --> 08:17.620
There are 8,000 good guys
on the force in this town...

08:17.713 --> 08:21.210
and I'm not gonna let one crud
like Stark muck it up for the rest of'em.

08:21.298 --> 08:24.878
We"re not killers.
What do you expect us to do, Maloney?

08:24.965 --> 08:30.252
l"m not hiring you to murder them.
Look, if you could get them to confess,
maybejust one of them...

08:30.341 --> 08:34.087
You've gotta stop them.
You've got to.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.753
We'll call you.

08:48.137 --> 08:51.053
That Maloney's
one tough dude, ain't he?

08:51.138 --> 08:54.137
I tell you, Hannibal...
these photos of his wife and daughter?

08:54.222 --> 08:58.217
Judging by the distance of photographer
to victim, perfect target range.

08:58.306 --> 09:02.764
- Any number of isolated areas with
easy escape. These guys are not slouches.
- [Car Door Opens, Closes]

09:02.849 --> 09:05.385
- Neither are we.
- [Engine Starts]

09:14.227 --> 09:17.261
Well, we're off
the bricks again.

09:17.353 --> 09:22.344
- Workin' for the police?
- Now, B.A., just because
we got a little problem with the law...

09:22.437 --> 09:24.891
doesn't mean you gotta
have a bad attitude.

09:24.980 --> 09:28.809
- Not all cops are like Lynch and his M.P.s.
- That's true.

09:28.897 --> 09:32.726
You know, when I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a policeman.

09:32.815 --> 09:35.434
- Did you know that?
- No.

09:35.524 --> 09:38.855
I remember, in the orphanage,
I had a whole scrapbook...

09:38.941 --> 09:41.098
of Dick Tracy
and his Crimestopper texts.

09:41.192 --> 09:44.439
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. My favourite TV show
was Dragnet.

09:44.526 --> 09:48.307
Learned most of my cons
from watching episodes
about bunco artists.

09:48.402 --> 09:52.942
All right, Hannibal, how do we
shut these guys down? I mean,
these guys are SWAT-trained...

09:53.028 --> 09:55.102
in special weapons
and tactics.

09:55.195 --> 09:59.272
- That's our bag. It's gonna be
like going up against ourselves.
- Exciting, isn't it?

10:00.905 --> 10:05.113
- Are you still tinkering
with miniaturized electronics?
- Yeah.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.938
Then I have a plan.

10:31.204 --> 10:34.701
- You, uh, got the kit from B.A.?
- Yep. I got it right here.

10:34.788 --> 10:38.285
- I can't believe this thing is gonna work.
- Sure, it's gonna work.

10:38.372 --> 10:42.830
- Everybody hates roaches.
Put 'em in your pocket.
- In my pocket?

10:42.915 --> 10:45.582
- Right.
- [Groans]

10:45.666 --> 10:47.740
Let's go.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.907
[Sighs]

10:51.459 --> 10:56.496
- We don't have any cockroaches
in our clothes.
- The custodian's puttin' me through hell...

10:56.585 --> 10:59.667
throwing my schedule around...
told me I had to get down here
this morning...

10:59.752 --> 11:02.834
before it gets any more out of hand
than it already is.

11:02.920 --> 11:07.045
- Well, I haven't seen a one. Oh,
it must've been Louie who called you.
- Yeah. Louie.

11:07.129 --> 11:09.453
Yeah, but he doesn't
come in for an hour...

11:09.546 --> 11:11.621
and I don't have authorization
to let you do this.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.463
Hey, think I wanna
be up at this hour?

11:14.548 --> 11:18.329
But, Louie, he said I had to be in and out
before your shift change.

11:18.424 --> 11:22.916
What the heck. We get paid
for service calls anyway, you know,
so, uh, we"re out of here.

11:23.008 --> 11:26.919
If I could just get
your John Hancock, huh, Sergeant?

11:27.009 --> 11:29.628
Wouldn't want Louie
to think we didn't show up.

11:29.718 --> 11:33.878
- Sorry. No pen.
- [Gasps]

11:33.969 --> 11:39.801
- Where the hell did that come from?
- Lookie there. Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Oh! Oh!

11:39.887 --> 11:43.005
Why, you little devil.

11:44.055 --> 11:47.256
Yeah, looks
like a breeding red.

11:47.347 --> 11:50.465
- Probably comes out of the baseboards.
- Look at them!

11:50.556 --> 11:55.049
- l"ve never seen"em before!
- [Face] Bad they"re runnin"around
in the open like this.

11:55.141 --> 11:58.056
That means there's
no more crawl space inside the walls.

11:58.142 --> 12:03.380
They probably laid all their eggs
in there, need a little more room,
little buggers.

12:03.476 --> 12:08.135
Yeah, that's when they usually wind up
lookin' for anyplace else around
where it's cool and dark.

12:08.227 --> 12:13.300
- Yeah, like lockers.
- Oh, tell the guys to shake out
their clothes before they put 'em on.

12:13.395 --> 12:18.054
Yeah. Oh, and check inside the caps.
These are germ carriers.

12:18.146 --> 12:21.015
Say, you know, we got that other call
we could make over on Gower.

12:21.105 --> 12:24.602
- Oh, Hip Bagel.
Yeah, they're open by 9.00.
- Just a minute here. Uh...

12:24.690 --> 12:27.357
- Okay. Uh, we called you...
- Yeah.

12:27.440 --> 12:32.857
You're gonna charge us.
So, uh, why don't you just
spray that thing or something?

12:32.942 --> 12:37.565
But I got roll call in 20 minutes,
so I expect you out of here in 15.

12:37.651 --> 12:43.270
- No prob. Great new stuff.
Only the bugs'll smell it. Huh?
- All right.

12:47.362 --> 12:50.526
[Groans]
How can Hannibal stand those things?

12:51.988 --> 12:55.152
- You got the kit out?
- Yeah.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.489
Replace the button on the collar
with the one from the kit.

13:05.575 --> 13:09.486
- Bringing me along to sew...
how wonderfully sexist.
- Well, we each do what we have to do.

13:09.575 --> 13:13.819
If you think you can pick these three locks
in 10 minutes, then, uh...

[Approaching Footsteps]

13:35.915 --> 13:38.037
- Someone's coming.
- I'm almost done.

13:38.124 --> 13:43.541
Hey, Cap"n, wait up.
What"s your hurry?

13:43.625 --> 13:45.949
This one's not as good
as the other one.

13:46.043 --> 13:48.876
Don't worry about it.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.962
- Aw, gee, guys.
- What? Are you nuts?

14:00.046 --> 14:02.582
- I'm sorry, man. You know...
- What the hell are you doin'
with that thing?

14:02.672 --> 14:06.120
- Well, l... [Stuttering]
- You're supposed to be killing bugs
or something, aren't you?

14:06.214 --> 14:09.129
Yeah, roaches
and the like, yeah.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.918
[Face]
Come on, kid. This one's a wrap.

14:12.007 --> 14:14.082
Yeah.

14:14.174 --> 14:17.422
- See that game last night?
- Oh, yeah.

14:17.509 --> 14:20.507
- Lakers really did it to 'em, didn't they?
- Yeah.

14:26.302 --> 14:31.340
- [Stark Over Machine] In that first half,
man, I thought they were gone.
- [Officer Chuckles] Magic.

14:31.429 --> 14:33.882
- He really pulls 'em out, doesn't he?
- Yeah.

14:38.930 --> 14:42.178
[Officer]
Did you see those moves?

14:42.265 --> 14:45.927
B.A.'s mini microphones are
comin' in better than an F.M. station.

14:46.015 --> 14:49.595
As long as we stay within a mile radius,
the reception'll be great.

14:49.683 --> 14:54.886
Stark and Meadows
are into any and all sports,
and Collins is into anything with a skirt.

14:54.976 --> 14:57.097
Incredible case of the hots.

14:57.185 --> 15:02.057
And Stark hangs out with some chick
named Bonnie Webb.

15:02.144 --> 15:06.221
- I'll get the address and phone number.
- I'll drop you at the paper on my way
to dump the exterminator truck.

15:06.312 --> 15:10.556
We need all the backup
we can get. Swing by the V.A. hospital
and pick up Murdock.

15:10.646 --> 15:14.688
Murdock? Why do we need that crazy fool?
We ain't flyin'.

15:14.772 --> 15:17.096
Now, no one said anything
about flying.

15:17.190 --> 15:21.231
No one said anything about tuberculosis.
There was nothing on the chart.

15:21.316 --> 15:24.267
- Surely we'd have noticed.
- It showed up on his biannual.

15:24.358 --> 15:29.894
With something as infectious
and contagious as this, we run the risk
of a full-out epidemic.

15:29.984 --> 15:32.769
Yeah. Uh...

15:33.860 --> 15:36.563
[Video Game: Weapons Firing]

15:36.653 --> 15:39.651
- Hi, Murdock.
- Oh, man. I was practically
through the meteor shower.

15:39.737 --> 15:43.566
Time to go bye-bye.
The magic word is tuberculosis.

- Yeah.

- [Wheezing, Choking Cough]
- Good Lord! Mr Murdock!

15:55.240 --> 15:57.315
I don't remember him
being like this.

15:57.408 --> 16:01.354
It must have been incubating
all this time. Good thing his tests
showed us the infestation this early.

16:01.450 --> 16:04.235
- [Coughs]
- I gotta get him right down
to County General into quarantine.

16:04.326 --> 16:09.565
- County General?
- I'd like a complete list of all patients
whom Murdock has been in contact with.

16:09.661 --> 16:12.576
- [Coughing Continues]
- He spends most of his time by himself.

16:12.661 --> 16:14.783
[Southern Accent]
And with my doggy, Billy.
What about my dog, Nurse?

16:14.870 --> 16:18.284
- He's been in that same position
for a month.
- This man has a dog?

16:18.371 --> 16:21.903
Uh, no, you see,
there is no dog.

16:21.997 --> 16:25.280
Oh, no! He's gone! It's too late, Doc!
[Throaty Cough]

16:25.373 --> 16:28.206
Oh, look. I don't know
if I should release him.

16:28.290 --> 16:33.790
- Mr Murdock is under care.
- Nurse, if you wanna take responsibility
for contaminating this entire ward...

16:33.875 --> 16:37.455
maybe the entire wing, perhaps
the entire hospital, then by all means...

16:37.542 --> 16:39.996
I'll leave the patient here with you,
but unless you have proper
quarantine facilities available...

16:40.085 --> 16:43.285
- No, no, no. It's just that...
- [Strangled Cough]

16:43.377 --> 16:46.909
- Ohh.
- Thank you.

16:47.003 --> 16:49.077
Oh, and if this man
has been eating in the cafeteria...

16:49.170 --> 16:52.786
I want the dietitian's staff to be given
full examinations and, if necessary, shots.

16:52.879 --> 16:56.127
- Hopefully this thing can be contained.
- My dog, Billy, Doc.
Tell me he's gonna make it.

16:56.214 --> 16:58.833
- Feel better, Mr Murdock.
- [Wheezing Cough]

16:58.923 --> 17:02.336
[Officer] I really have to
off this laundry guy?

17:02.423 --> 17:04.627
I mean, eight grand
is only 2,000 apiece.

17:04.715 --> 17:09.173
Listen to Rockefeller.
Two thousand is all we each
make in a month.

17:09.258 --> 17:14.330
How many more of these
we gonna go for? I mean,
I don't know about the rest of you guys...

17:14.425 --> 17:16.962
but I got
a nice little stash.

17:17.051 --> 17:20.549
Got the cabin up by the lake.
I'm just lookin' to take it easy.

17:20.636 --> 17:23.837
We just got into this
to make a couple of extra bucks. All right?

17:23.929 --> 17:27.544
- A little extra dough.
- I got it. I just wanna have a good time.

17:27.637 --> 17:32.380
- Why push it?
- Because maybe the rest of us aren't
as easy to please as you are, Collins.

17:32.472 --> 17:37.842
We're gonna make this hit,
and of course, as you know,
until we all back out, we're all in.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.931
- Yeah, I know. I know.
I was just, you know, well...
- Zip it!

17:41.016 --> 17:45.425
- Just get over to Whitsett Street
and dust that laundry guy, Delgado.
- Eight grand to blow away your brother...

17:45.517 --> 17:47.592
so you can take over
the stinkin' laundry.

17:47.684 --> 17:51.845
It's set, B.A. The guys should be here
in a couple of minutes.

17:51.935 --> 17:54.685
I want this set up just like it was
with the stewardess last month.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.472
Take Meadows with you,
but you get this Delgado.

17:57.562 --> 18:00.726
Okay already.
[Sighs]

18:00.812 --> 18:03.811
Come on, Meadows.

18:08.856 --> 18:11.973
- [Door Opening]
- Hey, guys. Long time, no see.

18:12.065 --> 18:15.763
- Not long enough.
- Be nice. [Coughs] I've been ill.

18:21.526 --> 18:24.145
- Hey, what's happenin'?
- We got one goin' down.

18:24.235 --> 18:27.566
- They got a hit set up in half an hour.
Whitsett and Arroyo.
- Half an hour?

18:27.652 --> 18:31.149
- That doesn't even
give us time to pitch our tents.
- Depends upon how fast B.A. gets us there.

18:40.447 --> 18:45.568
What are we gonna do?
Even if we catch them in the act,
we can"t make a citizen"s arrest.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.778
Four guys wanted by the military
aren't gonna have much credibility
in court.

18:47.865 --> 18:53.318
All I'm worried about now is cuttin' 'em off
at the pass. Besides, I'll think of something.

19:03.036 --> 19:05.241
- Señor Delgado?
- Sí. ¿ Qué pasa?

19:05.328 --> 19:08.741
- Do you speak English?
- Sí. Yes. What is it? What's going on?

19:08.829 --> 19:12.776
I'm Captain Roy McEvedy.
Lieutenant Harv Esterhaus
and Sergeant Smith.

19:12.872 --> 19:14.993
Move it, Sergeant.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.032
We're with the armed robbery task force.
We're trying to crack a ring
that's working this area.

19:18.123 --> 19:20.908
- I have heard nothing about any ring.
- We've kept it under wraps, sir.

19:20.998 --> 19:25.325
We didn't want the perpetrators
to find out how far along we were
in the investigation.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.201
They got two good approaches,
but the fastest escape route
is heading east on Fullerton.

19:28.292 --> 19:32.203
They'll probably work it from the rooftop,
either over the movie theatre
or the brownstone on the corner.

19:32.293 --> 19:36.786
- What does that have to do with me?
- One of our sources tells us they're gonna
hit your shop this morning.

19:36.877 --> 19:39.746
They are? Bueno. Bueno.
Let them come.

19:39.836 --> 19:43.499
Señor Delgado,
you're a brave man.

19:43.587 --> 19:47.878
We need more citizens like you.
Now, we need your help.

19:57.466 --> 20:00.713
Okay. He's there now.
Don't know why he's so late today.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.296
[Meadows Over Walkie-Talkie]
Do it before the street gets crowded.

20:46.811 --> 20:49.726
Hold it!

20:55.313 --> 20:59.770
You're a heck of an actor,
Hannibal. For a minute there, I thought
that bulletproof vest didn't work.

20:59.856 --> 21:03.897
- Who are you guys?
- You're shut down.
Take that back to Stark.

21:03.982 --> 21:06.649
You"re all measured
for body bags.

21:13.442 --> 21:15.564
[Cackles]

21:15.651 --> 21:18.685
Who were those guys?

21:18.777 --> 21:20.851
- [Stark] Who do you think they were?
- [Officer] Cops maybe.

21:20.944 --> 21:23.268
[Collins] No, no. No way.
They didn't act like cops.

21:23.361 --> 21:26.977
They're pros, Captain,
and they nailed us dead bang.

21:27.071 --> 21:30.852
They had us outnumbered. I told you
we were pushin' it tryin' this last one.

21:30.947 --> 21:34.147
- Sooner or later,
somebody had to find out.
- It had to be Maloney.

21:34.239 --> 21:38.068
- We should"ve dusted him.
- And what if he had our names
on some papers stashed around?

21:38.157 --> 21:42.483
So, instead of going to the chief,
he hires the seven samurai.

21:42.574 --> 21:45.739
Yeah, but how did they
find out about the Delgado hit?

21:45.825 --> 21:49.772
- There's no way they could've
figured that one out. There's no way.
- They had an ear on us.

21:49.868 --> 21:52.321
A bug? You think
they had us bugged?

21:52.410 --> 21:54.650
Had to.

21:54.744 --> 21:57.114
I don't want any more talk
in the room at headquarters...

21:57.203 --> 22:00.367
until we"ve had a chance
to sweep for those mikes, understand?

22:02.621 --> 22:05.536
But who in the hell
were those guys?

22:05.622 --> 22:08.289
It makes me nervous
to think we might've been bugged.

22:08.372 --> 22:10.328
- [Stark Continues Speaking
Over Recorder]
- Now we"ve primed the pump...

22:10.414 --> 22:13.082
let's see if we can
get it to blow a cylinder.

22:13.165 --> 22:17.989
- Man, I don't know why you had to go
and send them that warnin', Hannibal.
- B.A., that is what is called style.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.117
I call it dumb.
You don't go and kick the snake
you tryin' to sneak up on.

22:21.209 --> 22:26.330
- Part of my plan.
- Plan? I didn't hear anything
about any plan.

22:26.418 --> 22:31.160
- I must be fadin' in and out again.
- If you have a plan, Hannibal,
perhaps you'd care to share it with us.

22:31.253 --> 22:34.749
These guys gotta
have an Achilles' heel.

22:34.837 --> 22:39.579
We'll just keep pushing them
and pushing them and pushing them
until we find their weak link.

22:39.671 --> 22:44.460
It's the same plan we nailed that
Cong general with outside Khe San.

22:44.548 --> 22:48.329
- Ah, you mean where I took it in the leg?
- Where I got shot down?

22:48.424 --> 22:52.750
- That was a terrible plan.
- Now we got all the kinks worked out of it.

22:57.426 --> 22:59.417
Listen.

23:04.844 --> 23:07.464
Excuse me. Captain Stark,
there's a phone call for you.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.587
I left word with the
watch commander where we'd be.
Get ready. We might be rolling.

23:10.679 --> 23:13.250
- Thanks, Nancy.
- Mm-hmm.

23:13.346 --> 23:18.135
- How you doin', cutie? How's everything?
- Fine. Anything else you would like here?

23:18.222 --> 23:20.890
Everything I'd like, you got.

23:24.182 --> 23:27.714
Ooh, she's mine, all mine.
I can tell.

23:27.808 --> 23:29.883
[Chuckles]

23:30.976 --> 23:35.433
- Stark.
- Hey, Cap'n, your Stevie boy is right.

23:35.518 --> 23:38.719
We are pros,
and you guys are scuzzballs.

23:38.811 --> 23:43.137
- I don't know who or what you are,
buddy, but you're talkin' to a cop.
- Really?

23:43.228 --> 23:49.143
None of the cops I know sit around
over their coffee discussing a murder
they attempted that morning.

23:51.981 --> 23:55.264
- Nice, huh?
- [Stark] Let's get out of here.
The booth is bugged.

23:55.356 --> 23:58.106
How can they be buggin' us
in here? This is a coffee shop.

23:58.190 --> 24:03.014
We do always take one of the back booths
when we come here. There's just
no telling how big their operation is.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.107
These guys know exactly what kind
of a game they're playing.
What we gotta do...

24:06.192 --> 24:08.942
is get on the board
and turn this thing around.

24:09.026 --> 24:13.317
I'll, uh... I'll be at Bonnie's,
just in case any of'em contact you, okay?

24:13.402 --> 24:17.563
- Okay.
- Who are these guys, man?

24:32.199 --> 24:34.735
I think you know what I want:
something tasteful.

24:34.824 --> 24:38.072
- Something with red roses in it?
- I like that.

24:38.158 --> 24:42.817
[Affected English Accent] Ah, the rose.
The rose is a flower of passion which can be
fully appreciated for its...

24:42.910 --> 24:44.984
Murdock, just go.

24:45.077 --> 24:49.818
You should take care
and watch your attitude when speaking
to people with fragile psyches.

24:49.911 --> 24:55.412
What"s more, you give the impression
that your attitude is singularly
and pointedly directed at an individual...

24:55.496 --> 24:58.364
when, in fact, you're just one mean,
angry sucker to everybody.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.861
- Get!
- Gone!

25:02.706 --> 25:06.368
Really, B.A., you shouldn't
talk to Murdock like that.

25:06.457 --> 25:09.574
- You're gonna drive him nuts.
- [Grunts]

25:11.166 --> 25:15.872
[Woman] Robert, I have never seen you
this tense. Something at work?

25:17.126 --> 25:20.907
- Yeah, something at work.
- [Knocking]

25:21.002 --> 25:24.166
- You expecting somebody?
- No. Not really.

25:24.253 --> 25:27.251
- Who is it?
- [Murdock] Florist.

25:27.337 --> 25:30.371
Flowers? Well,
I hope they're from you...

25:30.463 --> 25:33.794
or I'm going to have
some awkward explaining to do.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.037
Yes, you are.

# Did you ever see a hearse go by #

25:45.883 --> 25:48.419
# And think that someday
you'd surely die #

25:48.509 --> 25:54.009
# They put you in a little box
and cover you over with dirt and rocks #
How am I doin'?

25:54.093 --> 25:57.756
- Who sent you here?
- Hey, wait, man. Look,
I'm just a driver, you know what I mean?

25:57.844 --> 26:01.921
I'm not even supposed to sing, but Chiquita
Banana got hung up at Valley Presbyterian.

26:02.012 --> 26:04.762
- Get out of here.
- What about the song?

26:04.846 --> 26:07.216
- You got two more verses comin'.
- Out!

26:11.223 --> 26:14.387
[Snapping Fingers]

26:14.473 --> 26:19.297
Hey, take it easy. It was probably
just a mix-up at the flower shop.

26:19.391 --> 26:23.303
- It was just a mistake that someone made.
- It sure was, baby.

26:23.392 --> 26:26.723
But it was a big one.

26:29.685 --> 26:34.806
Come on, now. Relax.

26:34.895 --> 26:37.847
You've been real on edge.
[Kissing]

26:39.438 --> 26:44.061
You know, you haven"t
told me that you love me in days.

26:44.147 --> 26:46.932

- No, no.

26:47.023 --> 26:51.231
- You wouldn't, Hannibal.
Not now. Yes, you would.

- Is Captain Stark there?

27:11.154 --> 27:13.441
Yes, he's here.

27:14.529 --> 27:19.484
- Stark.
- Captain, I hope I haven't pulled you
away from anything important.

27:19.572 --> 27:23.863
How long you wanna play this game?
How long you gonna hide
behind this receiver, mister?

27:23.948 --> 27:27.397
I wanna meet with you...
tonight, you and me.

27:27.491 --> 27:30.857
You got a favourite place?
Maybe where you bury the bodies
or something?

27:30.950 --> 27:35.443
Indian Dunes.
Four miles from the exit. 11.00.

27:35.535 --> 27:38.948
You got it. Oh, and Cap'n...

if you wouldn't mind me
giving you just a little advice...

27:42.203 --> 27:45.818

you love 'em every couple of days.

[Line Clicks Off]

28:08.251 --> 28:12.328
Stark just contacted the last
of the others. He made the call
from a phone booth on the street.

28:12.418 --> 28:15.334
I didn't think we'd get away
with those buttons as long as we have.

28:15.419 --> 28:18.334
They'll find out about 'em sooner or later.
When they do, our advantage is over.

28:18.420 --> 28:22.367
- I been disadvantaged all my life.
You get used to it.
- All ready.

28:22.463 --> 28:25.248
- Gonna work, B.A.?
- My part of the plan always works.

See you later, kiddo.

28:47.719 --> 28:51.665
Collins, you take that ridge up there,
the one we used last time. Donny,
that slope over there.

28:51.761 --> 28:54.843
Cover it well. I don't
want anybody coming in
on our backside, all right?

28:54.929 --> 28:57.678
- Now, remember: This is it.

28:57.763 --> 29:02.137
When we determine how many they are,
Meadows gives a signal, then it goes down.

Don't worry. When
we drive away from here,
those slimeballs are dead.

Turn to channel 38,

- Wanna step out and have a little talk?

Oh, sure. Have you
crank off a couple of rounds
into my duffel bag?

29:53.526 --> 29:57.735
- You first.
- Ready or not, here I come.

30:00.570 --> 30:04.102
Wait a minute, Hannibal.
What if they got a surprise?

30:04.195 --> 30:07.858
- You can't go out there.

- It's simple. I'm giving you a chance to live.

Tomorrow morning, you four march into
your chief"s office and give yourself up...

- for all the murders
you've been paid to commit.

You think a couple
of phone calls...

30:45.122 --> 30:49.033
a wreath of flowers,
and I'm gonna send myself up for life?

30:49.123 --> 30:53.995
It's either that or the death penalty, Stark.
And I've already passed that.

30:54.082 --> 30:56.453

Well, if you like, why don't you
have Meadows ring up your sentry...

out here in the night air.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.457
## [Stops]

31:34.551 --> 31:37.336
This is Mean, Musical,
Howling Mad Dog...

31:37.426 --> 31:40.840
coming to you
from high atop Indian Dunes.

31:44.053 --> 31:46.803
- You're good.
- [Hannibal] And you guys are finished.

31:46.887 --> 31:49.969
Tomorrow morning...

31:50.054 --> 31:54.049
the resignations and the confessions,
or you're all dead men.

32:01.099 --> 32:03.469
- Ready?
- Yeah.

32:03.558 --> 32:06.094
[Hannibal]
Hit it.

32:28.605 --> 32:32.351
And that, my friends,
is how they did it.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.011
They had us
every damned inch of the way.

32:35.107 --> 32:38.271
- Nothin' else, Captain?
- They didn't need anything else.
We were wondering...

32:38.358 --> 32:42.269
how in the hell they're bugging everywhere
we go before we get there, and we're
carrying the mikes right along with us.

32:42.359 --> 32:44.682
- That doesn't change our situation.
- The hell it doesn't.

32:44.776 --> 32:48.391
What about this threat
they made? They said we had
until today to turn ourselves in.

32:48.485 --> 32:50.974
You think I'm gonna sign a piece of paper
saying I'm a multiple murderer?

32:51.069 --> 32:54.151
- You think I'm gonna let
any of you guys do that?
- They said they were gonna kill us.

32:54.236 --> 32:56.939
- And it's not as though
they haven't had a chance.
- These guys aren't gonna kill anybody.

32:57.029 --> 32:59.316
They're not magicians.
They're only as good as their G-2.

32:59.404 --> 33:03.269
Right now, they're cut off.

33:03.364 --> 33:07.109
Right now,
I make my move.

33:08.865 --> 33:13.772
We're off-line, Hannibal.
All four mikes are dead.

33:13.866 --> 33:17.778
- [Hannibal] Looks like they found 'em.
- Great. That means we've lost the edge.

33:17.867 --> 33:21.530
Up against guys like these,
that doesn't make me feel too good.

33:21.618 --> 33:24.736
Shut up, Murdock!
Shut up!

33:25.994 --> 33:28.946
I told you
this plan stinks.

34:07.004 --> 34:11.212
That old snake
could get led into an inferno
by a nice set of legs.

34:16.465 --> 34:19.960
[Motorcycle Engine
Starts, Revs]

34:28.801 --> 34:31.882
- [Talking, Indistinct]
- You like that, don't you?

34:31.967 --> 34:34.636
- [Shutter Clicks]
- [Gun Cocks]

34:36.136 --> 34:38.257
You better know right now
I'm a cop.

34:38.344 --> 34:42.553
- I could debate that statement.
- Say "cheese."

34:42.638 --> 34:47.342
- What is this?
- Well, don't you recognize your
hill-climbing buddies from last night?

34:48.722 --> 34:51.591
But... Oh, yeah. Hey.
Oh, yeah. Hey.

34:51.681 --> 34:55.511
We've been talking
about that all morning, about
signing that confession and everything.

34:55.599 --> 35:00.092
Yeah. I'd sign that thing
in a hot second. Meadows would too,
but Stark... It's him, you know.

35:00.184 --> 35:03.929
Yeah, I figured as a group,
you might hesitate, so I decided
we need one of you to fink.

35:04.018 --> 35:07.100
- [Camera Shutter Clicks]
- Huh?

35:07.185 --> 35:10.219
Guess who
pulled the short straw?

35:10.311 --> 35:15.135
- What are you talkin' about?
- You're gonna turn state's evidence
on your friends.

35:15.229 --> 35:17.516
Stark'd kill me
if I tried anything.

35:17.604 --> 35:21.930
Stark"ll kill you anyway once
I send him these photographs of you
and us sitting here nice and cosy...

35:22.022 --> 35:24.807
chatting about which guys
you did or did not kill.

35:24.898 --> 35:29.307
It's just one cop's word
against another. There's no evidence
against us to convict us.

35:29.399 --> 35:33.394
What about the murder weapons?
I mean, ballistics are great in a courtroom.

35:33.483 --> 35:36.399
What? Do you think
we're ding-dongs? We get the weapons
from the evidence room...

35:36.484 --> 35:39.399
and then when we're done,
we put 'em back.

35:39.485 --> 35:43.562
And since they're impounded
and tagged before we do our jobs,
there's no way to check 'em.

35:43.652 --> 35:47.350
Well, that means they're still there.
That means you can get 'em.

35:47.445 --> 35:50.894
- That's not so easy.
- You can get 'em!

35:50.988 --> 35:54.319
Yeah, we can... I can get 'em, but, uh,
I could also go to the gas chamber.

35:54.405 --> 35:56.859
True.
But if I send these pics...

35:56.947 --> 35:59.899
over to Stark right now,
they'd be throwing dirt
on your box by midnight.

35:59.990 --> 36:03.072
You got me bumpin' off the walls
no matter what way I spin.

36:03.157 --> 36:06.819
If you turn state's evidence,
you could get a reduced sentence...

36:06.908 --> 36:11.282
and from where l"m standing,
that should look mighty cushy.

36:12.451 --> 36:16.232
You'll get the guns
and give 'em to Inspector Maloney.

36:16.327 --> 36:19.907
You'll, uh,
also give him a signed confession...

36:19.995 --> 36:23.657
describing what you and your buddies
have been doing off hours, won't ya?

36:23.745 --> 36:27.610
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'll get 'em and, uh, meet you.
- Good.

36:27.705 --> 36:32.742
[Hannibal Over Recorder]
I'll have Maloney at the Oceanside
Amusement Park at 3.00 this afternoon.

36:34.165 --> 36:37.745
Collins, you wimp,
I knew you'd go belly-up.

36:37.832 --> 36:40.996
Planting that bug on Collins
was a smart move, Captain.

36:41.083 --> 36:44.994
Well, never let it be said
that I don't learn by example, Meadows.

36:45.084 --> 36:49.244
Two hours, Oceanside Amusement Park.
Maloney'll be there too.

36:49.335 --> 36:53.828
Only this time, the surprise is going
to be on our side. They're never gonna
know what hit 'em. Let's go.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.093
[Face]
Oh, Collins!

37:43.348 --> 37:46.714
Got 'em by the ring toss.
They're heading over
toward the merry-go-round.

37:50.475 --> 37:53.011
I got 'em.
And there's another one.

38:00.185 --> 38:02.556
Shaeffer, flank 'em
on the right.

38:27.025 --> 38:29.977
B.A., hang on to this.
It's Amy's exclusive.

38:30.068 --> 38:33.315
- Where's Maloney?
- Well, we're showing you.

38:49.447 --> 38:52.197
- Position?
- Position.

38:52.281 --> 38:54.356
Position.

38:59.533 --> 39:02.200
So long, Collins.

39:45.711 --> 39:47.832
What the...

40:32.681 --> 40:34.755
Pow!

40:40.057 --> 40:43.720
"You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent...

40:43.808 --> 40:47.933
anything you say can
and will be used against you."

40:48.018 --> 40:50.471
[Low Mechanical Whirring]

41:24.651 --> 41:27.057
[Hannibal Grunting]

42:24.958 --> 42:27.032
Who are you guys?

42:47.421 --> 42:52.329
[Dispatcher] Notified military police
that suspects John Smith, Bosco Baracus
and Templeton Peck...

42:52.423 --> 42:55.587
have been spotted at a cocktail lounge
at Fifth and Broadway in Los Angeles.

43:05.801 --> 43:09.002
- How's the cold, Inspector?
Feelin' any better?
- Ohh. Feelin' better?

43:09.093 --> 43:11.168
Are you kiddin'?
I'm a hero downtown.

43:11.260 --> 43:17.175
- Even though you busted your fellow cops?
- Look, the P.D. is made up of the best.

43:17.262 --> 43:21.885
They don't like wires burning
in their own house. Cancers like this
are few, and that's how we like it.

43:21.971 --> 43:25.338
Really. I wanna thank you guys,
Miss Allen...

43:25.431 --> 43:28.346
for getting my name
put in the paper.

43:28.431 --> 43:31.549
- I don't deserve it. You caught them.
- Only if...

43:31.640 --> 43:35.054
That"s not true, Inspector.
If you hadn"t had the strength
to ignore their threats...

43:35.141 --> 43:38.590
and to go around a system
you respect, Stark and his men
would have never been caught.

43:38.684 --> 43:41.552
Which brings us to this.

43:46.394 --> 43:48.515
Wait a minute.
What is this?

43:48.603 --> 43:51.555
- I put the money
in your name. We had a deal.
- Read 'em the score, Face.

43:51.645 --> 43:54.016
Right.

43:54.104 --> 43:57.850
Four mini mikes: $ 1,500.
Four hot lights: $200.

43:57.938 --> 44:02.264
The bug van rental,
purchase of fire extinguishers,
overall patches... that"s 400.

44:02.356 --> 44:06.185
Floral display: 75. Oh, and we're billing this
at $300 a day per man...

44:06.274 --> 44:10.221
which is below the going rate, but that"s
the way Hannibal wanted it on this one.

44:10.316 --> 44:15.140
Ah. We"re throwing in make-up,
film, incidentals. Call it $3,680.

44:15.234 --> 44:18.517
We deducted it.
You keep the rest of your savings,
Inspector.

44:18.610 --> 44:23.185
- Looks like I found a bargain.
- Well, all things considered,
it was kind of fun.

44:23.278 --> 44:28.481
Hey, Hannibal, you were right.
Lynch"s men spotted us, and they"re
comin"up the street!

44:28.571 --> 44:32.151
- [All Groaning]
- Hey, wait a minute. Aren't you gonna
have a celebration drink with me?

44:32.238 --> 44:34.313
- Oh, I'm sure Miss Allen...
- Yeah, but I'm gonna...

44:34.406 --> 44:36.693
No, no. You can't be spotted with us;
you'll get burned.

44:36.781 --> 44:41.772
- Look. I wish I had the words to...
- Book 'em, Danno... Murder One.

44:46.325 --> 44:48.992
[Sirens Wailing]

44:56.244 --> 44:58.780
Why do they do it?

44:58.870 --> 45:01.074
[Chuckles Softly]

45:01.162 --> 45:04.528
For the jazz, man.

45:04.621 --> 45:07.193
For the jazz.
