00:00.470 --> 00:02.310
Previously on
"brothers & sisters"...

00:02.370 --> 00:05.470
mommy and daddy love you both more
than anything else in the world.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.540
But you don't love
each other anymore?

00:07.600 --> 00:09.210
Did you up your pain medication?

00:09.270 --> 00:10.600
I can't believe you'd ask me that.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.530
Julia took elizabeth and left.

00:12.590 --> 00:17.160
It says here that there's just tons of
young divorcs like yourself out there.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.960
Oh, goody. More competition.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.080
Weren't you wearing that yesterday?

00:21.180 --> 00:23.070
She is our employee!

00:23.170 --> 00:26.430
It ends now. From now on,
it is no longer a mistake.

00:26.470 --> 00:28.920
It is a oice. I hope
you make the right one.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.160
I'm not afraid.

00:31.570 --> 00:33.020
I love you.

00:33.060 --> 00:37.650
I think that what we have not only
feels good, but -it feels right.

00:37.690 --> 00:39.170
It is right.

00:41.620 --> 00:42.930
Look at you, honey.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.880
You're almost as
good at math as mommy.

00:44.990 --> 00:46.485
But you get to use a calculator.

00:46.520 --> 00:47.980
Mrs. Fletcher says that's cheating.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.220
Oh, well, mrs. Fletcher doesn't do cash
flow projections with seasonal variables.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.560
Eat fast. Cooper!

00:54.210 --> 00:56.340
Come on, coop, come finish
your breakfast, please.

00:57.980 --> 00:59.480
Permission slip.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.710
Why do they want the pediatrician's
nuer on every permission slip?

01:02.750 --> 01:05.069
Why don't they just
keep it on file, hmm?

01:05.750 --> 01:07.390
Cooper!

01:07.450 --> 01:08.820
Now, please!

01:08.840 --> 01:11.050
Argh, mateys!

01:11.550 --> 01:13.190
Oh, honey, it's
not halloween today.

01:13.260 --> 01:15.130
You have a field trip,
and it's cold at the zoo.

01:15.210 --> 01:16.120
No, it isn'T.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.500
Mom, I can't be seen with him.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.650
okay, that's your dad, guys.

01:20.710 --> 01:22.180
Let's go. Go, go, go.

01:22.830 --> 01:25.850
Cooper, I want you to finish
your breakfast in the car, okay?

01:27.010 --> 01:28.080
Hey, dad.

01:28.140 --> 01:29.940
Cooper!

01:30.890 --> 01:32.120
thanks for this, joe.

01:32.190 --> 01:36.080
I had to reschedule a conference call
because of our thing this afternoon.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.350
All right, no problem. I
like taking them to school.

01:40.170 --> 01:41.910
Hey there, captain no-beard, huh?

01:41.970 --> 01:43.200
You're gonna get cold in that.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.250
He has a jacket.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.960
Hand over your sword, buster.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.020
all right, you two, in the car.

01:48.180 --> 01:52.020
- Bye, mom.
-Try not to get syrup on daddy's car seats, okay?

01:53.880 --> 01:56.120
I asked kevin to represent me.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.880
Yeah, figured you might.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.550
See you at 2:00.

02:03.220 --> 02:07.800
our nation's levees, bridges and roads
need repair, and we need to fix them,

02:07.880 --> 02:12.150
and not by raising taxes
- by reallocating funds that are currently available.

02:12.170 --> 02:14.080
Governor adamson,
you have 30 seconds.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.480
Well, okay, look amy record.

02:15.560 --> 02:19.740
I have made infrastructure in
my home state my top priority.

02:19.820 --> 02:24.270
I mean, not to mention that-that-
you know, that-that pizza...

02:24.330 --> 02:26.360
I'm sorry. Lunch break is over.

02:26.420 --> 02:29.200
No, it's the pizza. The pizza-
the shrimp-they smell rancid.

02:29.310 --> 02:30.810
- I had three pieces.
-I had four.

02:30.910 --> 02:33.230
Well, it serves yoright for
eating pizza with shrimp.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.440
- please.
-Now we're trailing in five key states. So can we get back to it?

02:36.510 --> 02:38.890
"Senator, do you
believe in evolution?

02:38.970 --> 02:41.970
Or is it as the bible says, that
god created the world in six days?

02:42.050 --> 02:43.430
Well, that's a
little before my time.

02:43.490 --> 02:44.460
honey...

02:44.520 --> 02:45.350
no, that's good.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.380
No, use humor. It makes
you seem like a real person.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.180
I am a real person.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.850
should I repeat the question?

02:50.910 --> 02:52.470
Well, the question's the problem.

02:52.570 --> 02:55.440
Faith and science shouldn't
be mutually exclusive.

02:55.500 --> 03:01.230
Whether you beeve that six days is literally
624-hour intervals or something longer,

03:01.320 --> 03:04.050
well, that's a conversation
that we can have.

03:04.140 --> 03:07.270
But if you're asking me whether or
not I believe in god, the answer's yes.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.650
Oh, god.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.310
what is she, an atheist?

03:15.030 --> 03:16.510
I don't feel very good.

03:16.590 --> 03:17.760
well, I don't blame you.

03:17.840 --> 03:23.210
I read in today's op-ed piece- it says that
robert's entire campaign comes down to this debate.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.300
Ah, well, it kind of does.

03:25.420 --> 03:26.980
Well, that's an
awful lot of pressure.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.300
Robert's the best
of that awful bunch.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.820
Well, I'm sure he'll be happy to...

03:36.370 --> 03:38.090
Honey?

03:40.690 --> 03:42.500
I think I have food poisoning.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.610
Well, what did you eat?

03:43.670 --> 03:45.430
Pizza with shrimp.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.700
Did the shrimp smell bad?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.420
Well, yeah, yeah,
the whole room reeked.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.740
Mom, I-I-i can't
talk about it.

03:55.430 --> 03:58.070
Kitty, when was your last period?

03:58.120 --> 03:59.180
Mom.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.690
Sweetheart, are you late?

04:00.750 --> 04:01.880
I don't-I don't know.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.370
I...

04:03.450 --> 04:05.670
well, I guess maybe, yeah.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.320
I've-I've been stressed.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.900
Sweetheart, listen to me.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.830
I want you to go to the drugstore
and buy a pregnancy test.

04:12.890 --> 04:14.510
Mom, I'm not pregnant.

04:14.550 --> 04:16.110
We're-we're very careful.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.209
Honey, every time I was pregnant,

04:18.290 --> 04:22.120
I couldn't stomach fish or
crab or any kind of sea meat.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.770
Okay, okay, mom, stop.

04:24.850 --> 04:26.270
I'm going to the drugstore.

04:26.330 --> 04:28.860
Good. And then just call
me the minute you get back.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.020
hey, lena, can you come
in here for a second?

04:40.840 --> 04:43.200
Here. I pulled the file
for millview grocery.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.460
Thanks.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.080
Uh, sit down.

04:52.020 --> 04:53.210
Are you firing me?

04:53.270 --> 04:55.990
Because I just bought a really
amazing purse that cost me a fortune.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.010
I'm not firing you.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.260
But?

04:59.320 --> 05:03.120
But what happened the other
night, it can't happen again.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.310
Look, it's not about you.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.490
It's me.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.850
Gosh, that sounds so clich?

05:10.330 --> 05:13.850
Here-listen, tommy, I'm gonna
let you off the hook here.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.790
I'm not naive.

05:15.850 --> 05:18.790
I know you have a wife, a kid.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.870
I don't want to ruin that.

05:20.930 --> 05:23.190
It's just, eventually
everybody gets hurt.

05:23.270 --> 05:24.420
I
- I don't want to hurt julia.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.590
I don't want to hurt elizabeth.
I don't want to hurt...

05:26.650 --> 05:28.230
you. I...

05:28.410 --> 05:31.440
all right, I'm not really understanding
what you're asking me here.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.750
Are- look, if we can keep
it strictly professional-

05:33.810 --> 05:37.700
We can.

05:40.390 --> 05:45.820
I, uh, I can't say that I wish
that things weren't different.

05:46.410 --> 05:49.300
but, you know, don't
- don't worry about it.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.590
We're fine.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.650
Okay, thanks.

05:54.610 --> 05:56.800
So, uh, anything else?

05:56.880 --> 05:59.910
I need, uh, billy alba's number,
you know, the, uh, filtration guy?

05:59.970 --> 06:01.960
Will do.

06:06.050 --> 06:11.040
Miss whedon assumes full responsibility for the
mortgage payments and the property taxes on the house.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.250
And my client's guitar
collection, appraised at $46, 000?

06:14.290 --> 06:15.730
My client is entitled to half.

06:15.810 --> 06:16.730
No, that's all right.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.360
You don't have to
- joe, they're yours.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.580
Thank you.

06:20.650 --> 06:23.570
Good. Finally, we ask miss whedon's
remaining inheritance of the ojai stock

06:23.650 --> 06:27.510
be removed from the shares
designated as communal assets.

06:27.550 --> 06:29.060
Mr. Whedon's fine with that.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.100
He is?

06:32.400 --> 06:33.800
Thank you, joe.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.200
Okay.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.400
Uh, now as far as the
children are concerned,

06:37.470 --> 06:40.830
we have a temporary custody hearing
scheduled for later this week.

06:40.870 --> 06:43.880
I assume shared custody is
agreed to by both parties?

06:44.190 --> 06:46.690
Actually, my client would
like to alter this agreement.

06:46.730 --> 06:49.680
He believes the children need
stability and consistency of care,

06:49.740 --> 06:52.560
which, unfortunately, miss whedon
is not able to provide at this time.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.170
What?

06:53.230 --> 06:55.510
The demands of your position
as C.E.O.Of ojai foods-

06:55.590 --> 06:56.830
I'm sorry, that's ridiculous.

06:56.890 --> 06:59.760
My client has cutback her
hours since the separation.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.930
She's been completely
ailable for her children.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.100
What is this, joe?

07:03.180 --> 07:04.810
Not this morning.

07:05.070 --> 07:07.790
Mr. Walker, your client
called my client at 7:00 A.M.

07:07.870 --> 07:09.740
Because she couldn't drop
her children off at school.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.190
I had to reschedule
because of this meeting.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.950
And my client was contacted
by his son's teacher

07:15.020 --> 07:19.150
because miss whedon failed to sign the
necessary permission slip for a field trip.

07:19.210 --> 07:21.390
I signed it. I just forgot it.

07:21.470 --> 07:26.360
I'm sorry, are you seriously saying something that
minor could warrant a greater application for custody?

07:26.400 --> 07:31.190
This is simply a recent example of miss whedon's
inability to balance parenting with her career.

07:31.270 --> 07:34.390
What exactly are you
requesting in terms of custody?

07:35.860 --> 07:38.100
My client is seeking
primary custody.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.650
- No.
-Monday through friday and every other weekend.

07:40.730 --> 07:41.950
- No.
-It's okay.

07:42.010 --> 07:43.510
Counsel, in good faith, we
should have been notified

07:43.570 --> 07:46.380
that you're seeking a substantial
change in the ctody arrangement.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.220
I feel I've been
ambushed, as has my client.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.090
48 hours is what
the judge requested.

07:50.150 --> 07:51.760
We've given you 49.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.670
Thank you so much
for the extra hour.

07:53.710 --> 07:55.130
The meeting's over. Let's go.

07:55.190 --> 07:58.260
Joe, you can't be serious.
joe? -let's go, sarah.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.720
How about "ainsley"?"Alika"?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.870
Mom, stop naming
my nonexistent baby.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.260
And since when are you
so adventurous with names?

08:13.300 --> 08:16.800
You threatened to disown sarah
when she named cooper "cooper.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.620
" Oh, that's different.
Cooper's a last name.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.860
I just didn't think anyone
wanted to have two last names.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.180
"Alula.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.810
" Why do these things take so long?

08:24.900 --> 08:29.140
Well, at least you don't have to go to the doctor
and kill a rabbit to find out if you're pregnant.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.940
Wait, who's pregnant?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.000
Was that justin?

08:34.070 --> 08:37.049
- No, no, of course not. Justin's at physical therapy.
-Mom?

08:37.510 --> 08:40.090
Well, good, mom, because
nobody can know about this.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.640
Of course not, honey.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.670
There would be serious repercussions with
the campaign, and we're-we're not even...

08:47.620 --> 08:48.820
what is it, kitty?What is it?

08:48.900 --> 08:50.680
Is-is there a plus sign?

08:51.780 --> 08:53.720
Uh, no.

08:53.890 --> 08:55.340
No.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.900
No, it's negative.

08:59.610 --> 09:01.470
Oh, well, that's okay.

09:01.550 --> 09:04.600
You weren't even trying, and like
you say, it's really not a good time.

09:04.690 --> 09:07.220
Yeah, no, you're
right. You're right.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.360
Uh, I gotta go.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.560
Mom, I've-I've...

09:11.600 --> 09:13.160
I've got a lot of work to do.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.260
Okay, well, take something for your
damn stomach. I'm here if you need me.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.300
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

That's not joe.

I didn't even
recognize him in there.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.800
That's-that must be this lawyer.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.540
No, it's not. Look, sarah, the...

09:51.950 --> 09:53.860
she's representing her client.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.010
- That'shat joe wants.
-No, no.

No, look, we've- we've
had our disagreements-

09:58.060 --> 09:59.480
god knows, we're
getting a divorce-

09:59.520 --> 10:01.550
but we always put the kids first.

10:01.610 --> 10:04.300
Look, if I can just talk to
him one-on-one- no, no, no!

10:04.360 --> 10:07.520
Absolutely not. You
stay away from joe, okay?

10:07.600 --> 10:10.360
First things first. You tell me how
many times you've asked him for help.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.380
He's their father!

10:12.500 --> 10:16.240
While we were separating, I thought it
would be a good idea to have him around.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.680
I'm being punished for that?

10:17.720 --> 10:21.030
They'll use that to prove that he's been
and continues to be the primary caretaker.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.400
How?

10:22.480 --> 10:25.100
I support my family by working.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.330
And for the record, we
made that decision together-

10:27.410 --> 10:29.150
joe and me, when I was
pregnant with paige-

10:29.230 --> 10:33.450
I would work, he would stay home. God
knows I can bring in five times what he can.

10:33.530 --> 10:35.760
It made sense.

10:36.430 --> 10:39.250
And I thought he
was so progressive.

10:41.810 --> 10:44.260
You can fix this, right?

10:45.170 --> 10:48.410
Sarah, you need an
experienced lawyer, okay?

10:48.470 --> 10:50.630
And a weekend of cramming
is not gonna do it.

10:50.690 --> 10:52.030
Joe's hid a barracuda.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.840
I'm a guppy compared to that woman.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.500
You know me.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.410
You know what kind of mother I am.

10:59.970 --> 11:01.580
I need you.

11:03.650 --> 11:04.550
Okay, fine. Look,

11:04.610 --> 11:06.710
I'll take care of the hearing,
only 'cause it's preliminary,

11:06.810 --> 11:09.010
and I doubt the judge will
want to change anything.

11:09.050 --> 11:12.480
After that, I am referring you to
the toughest divorce attorney know.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.770
In the meantime, you have to get in touch with
everyone who's seen you in all your maternal glory.

11:16.830 --> 11:20.740
that means teachers, doctors, other moms, family
- everyone, okay?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.430
We need letters of reference
testifying to your character,

11:23.510 --> 11:27.060
letters that say you're as good
a parent, if not better, than joe.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.100
Can you do that?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.280
Good.

11:39.590 --> 11:40.450
You know what?

11:40.530 --> 11:41.590
I don't really want to know.

11:41.630 --> 11:42.570
Come on!

11:42.650 --> 11:44.770
No, I just-I don't
need to hear about it.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.150
Oh, my god, you are such a gossip.

11:48.230 --> 11:49.410
- I am not.
-Yes, you are.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.680
Look at your face.
You're dying to tell me.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.120
I am.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.170
I think kitty's pregnant.

11:56.330 --> 11:57.630
oh, my god. Is she?

11:57.690 --> 12:00.540
I overheard mom on the phone, and she
definitely used the word "pregnant.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.090
And kitty's the only one
of us having sex right now.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.700
- Wait. Unless you're
- oh, me?No, no.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.550
- No. Are you?
-No.

12:08.610 --> 12:10.360
God, I feel sad for us.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.740
wait, so are you sure about this?

12:12.800 --> 12:16.300
All I know is when mom saw me, she
took off and went right into the pantry.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.780
When kevin came out-pantry.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.580
When sarah got engaged-pantry.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.310
When kitty told mom she
was a republican-pantry.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.130
Blam. Smoking gun.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.270
You gotta promise
not to tell anyone.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.820
You're the gossip, not me.

12:31.090 --> 12:33.800
D when adamson challenges you
on your bilingual campaign ads?

12:33.820 --> 12:37.100
Look, if people want to succeed in the
united states, they gotta learn english.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.380
But if I want to speak to the latino voters
in my state, I'm damn well gonna do it.

12:41.430 --> 12:42.460
Where's the trash can?

12:42.520 --> 12:45.410
I'm feeling much better, travis. Thank
you for asking me. How are you holding up?

12:45.470 --> 12:48.650
My head is so full of debate prep that I can't even
- how are you?

12:48.690 --> 12:50.600
I'm good. Um, I-

12:50.640 --> 12:53.270
sorry to interrupt, but we
need a final decision othe tie.

12:53.350 --> 12:54.960
All right, well, red's too obvious.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.110
Uh, light blue practically
screams democrat.

12:57.190 --> 12:59.510
Fine. We'll go with that one.

12:59.590 --> 13:02.290
Uh, robert, I would like to talk
to you when you get a chance.

13:02.370 --> 13:04.810
Well, you can't have him. We've still
got the immigration policies to go over.

13:04.870 --> 13:07.470
Okay, well, have you prepped
all the family value questions?

13:07.530 --> 13:08.760
Yeah, he's pro-life.

13:08.820 --> 13:09.950
And pro-birth control.

13:10.010 --> 13:11.180
Yeah, but don't hit that hard.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.900
What about unwed mothers?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.940
Yeah, well, I was at the
fund-raiser the other night,

13:16.030 --> 13:19.050
and I was cornered three times,
people asking me questions.

13:19.085 --> 13:20.260
that's bizarre.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.460
Yeah, I thought it was, too.

13:21.530 --> 13:23.190
Kitty, we have the latest draft
of the senator's opening remarks.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.300
Oh, okay. I'll be there
in a minute. Robert-

13:24.380 --> 13:27.140
do I even have a
position on unwed mothers?

13:27.210 --> 13:31.630
Yes, you do, and it's the same as every other republican
- you support the nuclear family.

13:31.690 --> 13:33.120
Well, that's a
little narrow-minded.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.410
Stop alienating the base, kitty.

13:35.570 --> 13:39.780
Look, this is exactly how they're gonna split
hairs and use your voting record against you.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.780
Travis is right.

13:41.860 --> 13:45.050
So I'm gonna go work on the
draft, and you focus on the prep.

13:45.110 --> 13:46.270
You're okay with the tie?

13:46.330 --> 13:49.790
'Cause they're telling me it's as
important as my take on the middle east.

13:50.150 --> 13:52.460
Yeah, the tie is
- the tie is great.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.020
The tie is great.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.080
They're teamsters. Let it go.

13:58.140 --> 13:59.100
Tommy?

13:59.170 --> 14:00.070
Oh, sorry.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.890
One turkopolis,
ready for consumption.

14:01.950 --> 14:03.960
Oh, thanks. I'm starving.

14:04.020 --> 14:06.840
I guess you're right. I
mean, let them keep their 14%.

14:06.870 --> 14:08.530
It's not worth the hassle.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.700
Lena, can you hang for a second?

14:16.980 --> 14:22.040
I'm a little bit worried that you're
overstepping your duties as office manager.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.220
By making him a sandwich?

14:24.290 --> 14:26.200
Please don'T.

14:26.230 --> 14:28.520
I'm better at this.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.130
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

14:31.190 --> 14:34.040
I'm talking about you and tommy.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.390
Whatever is happening
between the two of you,

14:36.450 --> 14:39.830
whatever extracurricular
relationship you have,

14:39.870 --> 14:43.180
it's bad for this company.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.150
End it.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.760
It's already over.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.280
Good.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.250
Thanks, lena. That's all.

15:01.910 --> 15:03.540
hello.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.830
Mrs. Fletcher, thank youo
much for calling me back.

15:07.590 --> 15:09.880
Uh, no, no, everything's fine.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.360
Yeah, she is. She's doing
very well at math. Thank you.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.130
Uh, actually, this
is a little awkward.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.530
Um, my husband joe and i
are trying to settle custody,

15:18.600 --> 15:21.480
and the thing is, I need
a character reference.

15:21.560 --> 15:25.300
You know what kind of parent I
am, and I hoped that you would...

15:27.880 --> 15:30.260
um, I'm sorry.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.690
Joe asked you a month ago?

15:33.440 --> 15:35.860
You are unbelievable.
You got to all of them-

15:35.900 --> 15:37.820
mrs. Fletcher, dr. Wasson,

15:37.880 --> 15:40.860
the dance instructor, the
gymnastics teacher, our neighbors.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.020
Joe, how long have
you been planning this?

15:43.080 --> 15:44.670
We shouldn't be talking
without our attorneys.

15:44.730 --> 15:48.870
Oh, please don't hide behind your overpriced
lawyer, which, by the way, I am paying for!

15:49.670 --> 15:52.760
joe, do you really
hate me this much?

15:52.820 --> 15:56.960
You're willing to deny everything
that I've done for our family for what,

15:57.020 --> 15:58.210
to hurt me?

15:58.270 --> 15:59.750
This might be hard
for you to understand.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.050
This isn't about you.

16:01.100 --> 16:02.990
The kids need stability, sarah.

16:03.050 --> 16:04.140
Oh, don't give me that, joe.

16:04.220 --> 16:05.820
Mom?

16:05.900 --> 16:06.930
Paige.

16:06.990 --> 16:08.930
Wait
- paige, go back inside. Go on. Go on.

16:08.965 --> 16:11.680
Sweetie
- that's a good girl.

16:15.740 --> 16:16.710
Let me talk to her.

16:16.780 --> 16:17.990
Sarah, we're done here.

16:18.070 --> 16:19.130
You've gotta let me talk to her.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.990
I'll drop them off tonight.

16:28.830 --> 16:31.810
Uh, mom said she left her
character reference for sarah in he.

16:35.530 --> 16:38.470
Oh, go I said a
"letter, " not "novel.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.300
" Mom's got a lot to say.

16:41.070 --> 16:43.660
all right, so sarah and
joe-level with me. How bad is it?

16:43.740 --> 16:46.370
It's not good but, you
know, it's up to a judge now.

16:46.390 --> 16:47.650
Want some good news?

16:47.730 --> 16:49.450
Kitty'S...

16:51.100 --> 16:52.640
pregnant?

16:52.720 --> 16:53.810
She wouldn't, not now.

16:53.870 --> 16:56.280
I heard mom talking to her
on the phone, and mom saw me

16:56.340 --> 16:58.080
- right off into the pantry.

16:58.220 --> 16:59.490
- Oh, my god.

16:59.580 --> 17:00.560
Did she go all the way in?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.060
All the way in.

17:03.260 --> 17:04.339
I'm gonna be an uncle again.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.839
Dude, do me a favor. Wait for her to
tell you. 'Cause she's gonna kill me.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.069
Yeah, you're right.
She will kill you.

17:08.130 --> 17:12.099
Well, I have to deal with the fate of our other niece and nephew right now
- no pressure.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.579
All right, good luck.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.380
What are you drawing there?

17:15.420 --> 17:17.319
- Fangs.
-Oh, they're fangs?

17:17.380 --> 17:18.740
Well, they're gonna be great.

17:18.810 --> 17:20.530
Paige, you want to
carve one, honey?

17:21.410 --> 17:23.010
No, thank you.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.570
you know, honey, it's almost time for
your bath. Why don't you run upstairs?

17:29.630 --> 17:31.920
And I'll let you stay up
and watch "the great pumpkin.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.400
" Come on, I'll be right up.

17:38.170 --> 17:40.130
can mama sit down?

17:46.540 --> 17:49.850
I'm sorry you had to hear
your daddy and me fighting.

17:49.990 --> 17:51.710
That shouldn't have happened.

17:51.950 --> 17:53.580
Who won?

17:54.190 --> 17:55.150
What?

17:55.210 --> 17:57.560
The fight. Who are
we gonna live with?

17:58.950 --> 18:01.870
It's not about winning or losing.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.970
We're just trying to figure out
what's best for you and cooper,

18:06.010 --> 18:08.565
and sometimes we disagree.

18:08.600 --> 18:13.490
But your daddy and i will
work it out, whatever it takes.

18:13.530 --> 18:15.630
I wish you could come
trick-or-treating with us.

18:15.690 --> 18:20.980
You're gonna have such a good time
with your dad and coop and gabe.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.330
But you'll be all alone.

18:23.490 --> 18:26.730
Well, worrying is my job.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.020
Yours is to have fun, okay?

18:30.050 --> 18:32.390
Yeah, e-mail me
the pictures. Great.

18:33.110 --> 18:37.400
Uh, I'll be at my mom's, uh,
watching the debate, handing out candy

18:37.480 --> 18:40.240
and missing my daughter's
first halloween.

18:41.110 --> 18:44.160
look, julia, tt's the
other line. I gotta take it.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.980
Give elizabeth a kiss.

18:47.020 --> 18:48.490
Bye.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.750
tommy walker.

18:52.270 --> 18:54.000
Calm down.

18:54.060 --> 18:55.640
Where are you?

18:57.000 --> 19:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:15.330 --> 19:17.740
I didn't mean to call
you. I tried everyone.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.230
I just-I didn't
trust myself to drive.

19:20.270 --> 19:21.950
I've been there plenty.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.260
Get in.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.590
Did your boss have to
come and pick you up, too?

19:26.630 --> 19:29.400
Well, if you count my dad, yeah.

19:31.150 --> 19:33.440
oh, please don't
tell holly about this.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.850
Why would I?

19:34.910 --> 19:37.460
She seems to know everything else.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.870
What, did she say something to you?

19:39.950 --> 19:41.070
Yes.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.400
And she's right.

19:42.460 --> 19:46.270
This is my first real job,
and I am messing it up.

19:46.330 --> 19:48.330
Lena, you're doing great.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.560
All right?Don't worry about holly.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.280
This isn't about her.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.620
I am sorry.

20:03.220 --> 20:04.840
no, don't be.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.350
limiting earmarks. -For.

20:14.410 --> 20:16.060
- Gasoline tax.
-Against.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.350
Credit loan oversight.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.220
we need tougher legislation.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.310
And more coffee.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.340
Listen.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.290
Tomorrow...

20:26.810 --> 20:29.860
can we survive a
respectable showing?

20:29.900 --> 20:31.410
Don't listen to the pundits.

20:31.490 --> 20:33.170
Their job is to create drama.

20:33.210 --> 20:36.070
It's not just the pundits.
It's the people. There'S...

20:36.250 --> 20:38.410
something holding them
back from committing.

20:38.490 --> 20:41.190
This is not the time to get
philosophical about the people.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.270
You have their support.
Look at your contributions.

20:43.330 --> 20:44.930
Yeah, but I don'want to
finish second or third.

20:44.990 --> 20:47.160
Robert, listen, yore nervous.

20:47.210 --> 20:50.790
Now this prep will pay off. Tomorrow, all you
have to do is go out there and don't screw up.

20:50.890 --> 20:52.620
People just want
to know who you are.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.370
This isn't a date.

20:54.450 --> 20:55.700
This isn't a dinner party.

20:55.780 --> 20:59.010
If I can't articulate my positions
in a way that people get it, hear it

20:59.070 --> 21:01.850
and want me to lead, then it might
as well be a damn beauty pageant.

21:01.930 --> 21:03.770
Okay, you're fried.

21:03.810 --> 21:04.830
Uh, go home.

21:04.890 --> 21:05.860
Get some sleep.

21:05.900 --> 21:10.730
Travis, can you just not manage me and
talk to me about what's really going on?

21:16.320 --> 21:17.840
You're home.

21:17.940 --> 21:19.490
We finally called it.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.940
I brought you some sushi.

21:23.460 --> 21:27.170
Uh, well, thanks, but,
um, I'm not really hungry.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.170
You're gonna want
champagne though, right?

21:29.610 --> 21:32.210
Shouldn't we wait
until after the debate?

21:33.050 --> 21:36.340
No. I think getting through debate
prep is enough of a victory. Don't you?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.160
Oh, well, I'M...

21:39.010 --> 21:42.000
I'm just not ready to put
anything into my stomach yet.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.750
Think of it as ginger
ale, only more fun.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.460
Robert.

21:48.610 --> 21:50.550
Travis was right.

21:51.070 --> 21:52.910
You're pregnant.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.390
Travis.

22:00.170 --> 22:01.440
How did he know?

22:01.480 --> 22:05.270
He suspected, between the vomiting and
the sudden concern for unwed mothers.

22:05.430 --> 22:06.700
How come I didn't know?

22:06.740 --> 22:12.270
Well, I tried telling you, but between
choosing a tie and going over talking points

22:12.330 --> 22:14.110
, I didn't really
see an opportunity.

22:14.170 --> 22:17.720
You could've taken one minute to tell
me that we were gonna have a baby.

22:17.780 --> 22:18.980
You chose not to.

22:19.020 --> 22:21.530
No, I just didn't know how
you were gonna react, did I?

22:21.580 --> 22:22.960
Don't second-guess me.

22:23.020 --> 22:25.270
I have enough people doing that.

22:26.300 --> 22:27.760
I look to you for honesty.

22:27.820 --> 22:28.650
You know what, robert?

22:28.720 --> 22:31.410
You're not the only one that
has a right to be upset here.

22:31.470 --> 22:33.620
I just found out I'm pregnant.

22:33.660 --> 22:37.400
And-and what, do I- do I get
to jump up and down and be giddy

22:37.460 --> 22:40.420
and-and call my mother and call
my fianc?and call my friends?No!

22:40.460 --> 22:43.540
Do I-do I get to go out
and buy booties or whatever?

22:43.580 --> 22:44.620
No.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.280
No, because I have to
worry about your campaign.

22:47.350 --> 22:48.780
Kitty, sit down. You're pregnant.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.720
That's a myth.

22:50.780 --> 22:52.780
You want to know why I
didn't rush in and tell you?

22:52.820 --> 22:55.030
Because this has to be
the worst possible timing.

22:55.090 --> 22:56.530
We're not even married,

22:56.590 --> 23:01.590
which means some idiot on talk radio is
gonna make this into a really big deal.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.260
I mean, you think it's
hard running for president?

23:06.280 --> 23:09.210
You should try being
engaged to the guy who is.

23:09.250 --> 23:12.650
You're right, but you
still should've told me.

23:12.710 --> 23:15.850
Oh, honestly, is that
what you're upset about?

23:15.940 --> 23:18.780
Or are you upset about how this
is gonna go down in the red states?

23:18.840 --> 23:22.740
Of course I'm thinking about that, and
so should you, given your job description!

23:26.400 --> 23:28.590
How did this happen?

23:28.630 --> 23:30.460
I thought we were being careful.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.420
We were.

23:33.620 --> 23:36.070
It happened anyway.

23:38.330 --> 23:41.290
I don't know what part of me is more furious
- the fianc?

23:41.350 --> 23:43.210
who was the last person
in the room to know,

23:43.270 --> 23:46.350
or the candidate who just got
sandbagged by one of his senior staffers,

23:46.430 --> 23:50.870
who, incidentally, may or may not be
getting sick backstage while I try to debate.

23:54.330 --> 23:55.380
Where are you going?

23:55.420 --> 23:57.240
I'm going to bed,

23:57.300 --> 24:02.130
and you can relax, because tomorrow night I'm
gonna be watching the debate with my family.

24:02.170 --> 24:05.310
You don't have to worry about
me getting sick backstage and-

24:05.370 --> 24:08.540
and having people speculate.

24:13.910 --> 24:14.940
xxxxxxxxx

24:14.980 --> 24:16.710
oh, hi!Okay.

24:16.770 --> 24:20.410
You look so cute. Everybody,
just take one. Just take one.

24:20.450 --> 24:23.260
There you go. You look so cute.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.920
What about me?

24:24.990 --> 24:26.460
Well, you're cute, too.

24:26.500 --> 24:30.010
Well, maybe not as cute as the
monkey, but pretty darn cute.

24:30.150 --> 24:31.320
Come on in.

24:31.380 --> 24:34.190
Mom, you are
so over-the-top.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.420
Sweetie, I'm sorry I
got you all worked up.

24:37.480 --> 24:41.470
I don't know. I can usually spot
a pregnant walk from a mile off.

24:41.530 --> 24:43.240
It's the little mama.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.110
And kitty!

24:45.170 --> 24:46.640
how are you feeling...

24:46.720 --> 24:48.650
about the debate?

24:50.580 --> 24:52.140
Well, I feel confident.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.420
Sort of.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.860
Robert and I had a tiff.

24:54.920 --> 24:55.890
A tiff?About what?

24:55.970 --> 24:58.190
Uh, about
- about work stuff.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.480
my gosh, at this rate,
we're gonna run out of candy.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.700
I got so much more
than last year, too.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.590
hold on!Coming!

25:06.450 --> 25:10.290
there it is, the republican debate
on the scariest day of the year.

25:10.350 --> 25:11.690
So kitty's pregnant.

25:11.740 --> 25:12.460
What?

25:12.560 --> 25:14.650
But, you know, we're in
"not supposed to know" mode.

25:14.710 --> 25:15.890
not supposed to know what?

25:15.950 --> 25:17.920
Oh, we're not supposed
to know about kevin's car.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.920
Yeah, I'm gonna get a
hybrid, you know, because of,

25:19.980 --> 25:23.050
you know, global warming, and i
freckle too much when I get sun.

25:23.090 --> 25:24.770
Hey, kitty, come on,
sit down over here.

25:24.830 --> 25:26.180
It's a great chair.
Put your feet up.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.830
No, the-the couch is fine.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.210
here we go. It's starting.

25:33.670 --> 25:35.460
Good evening from boise, idaho.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.600
I'm patricia bower.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.040
Welcome to the
republican primary debate.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.880
Let me introduce the candidates.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.190
First
- congressman tom burgess...

25:45.500 --> 25:47.400
governor clay adamson...

25:47.730 --> 25:48.910
oh, I'll get that.

25:48.970 --> 25:50.480
And senator robert mccallister.

25:51.830 --> 25:54.060
Ooh, mccallister's tie
- tragic.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.120
Oh, shut up, kevin. What
do you know about ties?

25:56.180 --> 25:58.400
that tie isn't so bad.
It's not bad at all.

26:05.670 --> 26:07.130
coming.

26:08.330 --> 26:09.570
Took you long enough.

26:09.630 --> 26:10.630
Where's your costume?

26:10.690 --> 26:12.700
I'm an abandoned husband.

26:12.740 --> 26:14.200
- You?
-Wounded vet.

26:14.260 --> 26:15.410
Cool.

26:15.470 --> 26:17.600
So you hear about kitty?

26:17.830 --> 26:21.640
Yes, I voted against expanding
children's health care surance.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.080
We have the best health
care of any nation...

26:23.180 --> 26:25.010
because it's a free
market system. -Mother.

26:25.070 --> 26:28.690
which is why we should be helping
businesses cover insurance costs.

26:28.750 --> 26:32.960
And if elected, I will put forth
a plan advocating tax breaks...

26:33.000 --> 26:35.370
oh, come on, robert.
Just get a word in.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.840
but let's be honest.
The system is broken.

26:37.900 --> 26:42.590
Without preventative heth care or disease
management, we've overrun our emergency rooms,

26:42.630 --> 26:46.300
overtaxed our doctors and have an
increasingly unhealthy population.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.430
we need to break for a commercial.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.770
he seems to be doing well.

26:51.830 --> 26:53.850
Yeah, he just has to land it.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.790
I got the last one.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.350
Oh, fine, I'll get it.

26:57.410 --> 26:58.590
Don't give 'em too much candy.

26:58.650 --> 26:59.700
Mom, you are so cheap.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.210
we'll run out!

27:02.440 --> 27:04.170
Trick or treat.

27:04.210 --> 27:07.530
look, sexy nurse, sexy cat, sexy...

27:07.590 --> 27:09.560
what, prostitute?

27:09.640 --> 27:10.770
Very sweet.

27:10.850 --> 27:12.050
But you're too old.

27:12.110 --> 27:15.550
Uh, candy, or we
have eggs in the car.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.350
Okay, fine.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.430
One-one-one
apiece.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.830
No, I oid-why aren't

27:21.870 --> 27:23.610
- trick or treat.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.700
I didn't expect to see you.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.680
Well, the only thing more depressing
than not having your kids at halloween

27:29.750 --> 27:32.130
having to feed candy
to other people's kids.

27:32.190 --> 27:33.770
I thought the republican
debate would be more fun.

27:33.830 --> 27:35.480
Affirmative action is necessary.

27:35.540 --> 27:38.090
It gives historically
excluded groups access

27:38.170 --> 27:39.640
oh, god. Who got her started?

27:39.700 --> 27:40.880
hey, everyone.

27:40.940 --> 27:42.210
Hi, honey.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.630
Did you read my letter?

27:43.690 --> 27:44.900
What, the novel?

27:44.940 --> 27:47.220
Your positions on
roe V.Wade. Governor?

27:47.260 --> 27:51.780
I've been advocating conservative
views for the past 40 years.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.410
A culture of life represents
america at its best.

27:55.450 --> 27:56.790
senator mccallister?

27:56.850 --> 28:00.400
As a matter of policy, I
look to the constitution.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.850
And contrary to what
roe V.Wade implies,

28:02.910 --> 28:07.950
there's nothing in the constitution that prohibits
abortion or guarantees it as aundamental right,

28:08.010 --> 28:13.090
and that's why believe the states should use their
own individual discretion and craft their own policy.

28:13.130 --> 28:15.370
Remind me to cut a check
for pro-choice america.

28:15.440 --> 28:20.620
It seems from senator mccallister's voting record
that he has no consistent position on the matter.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.760
with all due respect, a nuanced
position is different than no position.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.870
Yes. I gave him that line.

28:26.930 --> 28:29.090
- Honey, that's wonderful.
-hat's a great line.

28:29.130 --> 28:31.730
Considering senator mccallister's
fiance is pro-choice...

28:31.790 --> 28:34.850
- wait, wait, wait. -I'm not surprised
he's flip-flopping on the issue.

28:34.890 --> 28:36.690
- That's not good.
-that's low.

28:36.730 --> 28:38.100
All right, I'm gonna
go for wine. Anybody?

28:38.140 --> 28:39.700
Yeah, everyone should
try our new pinot.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.760
Everyone except kitty.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.620
- what?
-what?

28:44.470 --> 28:45.990
I mean rebecca.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.970
She's underage.

28:48.610 --> 28:50.350
No, I'm not.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.810
You're lying.

28:52.950 --> 28:54.400
No, I can tell,
you're totally lying.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.630
I always know when you're lying.

28:55.670 --> 28:56.650
Kevin told me.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.050
- Justin told me.
-Me, too.

28:58.110 --> 28:59.250
And me.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.180
I'm really lost right now.

29:03.830 --> 29:05.510
I may have heard mom on the phone.

29:05.550 --> 29:06.460
About what?

29:06.520 --> 29:08.790
You were talking to kitty
about being pregnant.

29:08.890 --> 29:09.990
Kitty's pregnant?

29:10.050 --> 29:11.630
Mom, you went
straight to the pantry.

29:11.690 --> 29:14.820
Oh, for god sake, mother, don't you
think you could be a little more discrete?

29:14.880 --> 29:15.860
The pantry?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.690
Now that's what you
get from eavesdropping.

29:18.730 --> 29:22.980
Okay, yes, your sister took a
pregnancy test, but it was negative.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.890
I knew she would have told me.

29:24.970 --> 29:27.620
Well, actually, it was, um,

29:27.680 --> 29:28.640
positive.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.440
What?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.120
Why didn't you tell me?I'm the
one that sent you to the drugstore!

29:32.200 --> 29:34.390
I couldn't tell you,
not before I told robert.

29:34.450 --> 29:36.160
Oh, I'm your mother!

29:36.220 --> 29:37.670
You could tell me.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.020
I'll get it.

29:39.270 --> 29:40.560
Stop it.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.210
Guys, guys, guys.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.260
Moving on to the issue of tax
policy, senator, if elected,

29:44.300 --> 29:48.220
would you adjust the current tax system
as congressman bridges suggested earlier?

29:48.270 --> 29:49.500
Yes, I would.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.560
And, you know...

29:52.420 --> 29:56.890
you know, I'd like to go back to
governor adamson's comments on my fiance.

29:56.920 --> 30:03.810
Apparently he believes that this party should be open
only to those who share his own very conservative views.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.730
And, you know, abraham
lincoln freed the slaves.

30:05.810 --> 30:10.320
Teddy roosevelt was a conservationist
who founded our national parks.

30:10.340 --> 30:15.320
Dwight eisenhower used federal
troops toesegregate the schools.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.790
All these men were republicans.

30:17.850 --> 30:24.290
And as for bringing my fiance's personal
views into this, you know, clayton,.

30:24.370 --> 30:26.910
you're fond of
invoking family values

30:26.970 --> 30:28.930
Well, I value my family,

30:29.010 --> 30:32.725
and so I'd appreciate it if you
debated me instead of my loved ones.

30:32.760 --> 30:38.620
Because as I think we all can attest, our decision to
run for president is much harder on them than it is on us.

30:39.260 --> 30:44.270
and if he wants to continue to talk
about my family or any other nonissue,

30:44.330 --> 30:47.280
I'm happy to use his rebuttal time
to talk about my position on iraq.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.720
oh, sweetheart, he's gonna
be a wonderful father.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.525
Yeah, he is.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.660
I can't believe you're
pregnant! -Mama Kitty!

30:56.720 --> 30:58.110
A new baby!

31:04.220 --> 31:08.150
I, uh, thought I'd
try out the new pinot.

31:10.580 --> 31:12.380
Congrats.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.790
My sister's having a baby.

31:14.850 --> 31:16.830
That's such great news.

31:19.390 --> 31:22.190
You might want to stay away
from all things seafoody.

31:22.250 --> 31:23.570
Oh, no, I got that.

31:23.630 --> 31:27.870
And I'll get youmy "what to expect" book,
though some women say it makes them insecure.

31:27.930 --> 31:30.830
Actually there's this other book
that everybody's talking about.

31:30.890 --> 31:34.510
Oh, and ginger tea really
helps with the puking.

31:34.550 --> 31:37.250
right. And, sarah?

31:37.290 --> 31:39.740
What can I do for you?

31:40.740 --> 31:46.770
Make me not feel like every decision
I've made in my adult life was wrong

31:46.850 --> 31:49.640
and I'm gonna lose
my kids because of it.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.690
Oh, sarah, come on.

31:51.770 --> 31:53.840
I mean, just look at those kids.

31:53.900 --> 31:57.220
I mean, paige is more mature
than we were when we were 20,

31:57.300 --> 32:01.760
and-and she's so freakin'
smart, it's-it's scary.

32:01.850 --> 32:04.240
And-and
cooper- cooper

32:04.300 --> 32:06.510
, I mean, he's
so-he's so confident.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.590
He walks into a room like he's gonna take
over the world, and it's all because of you.

32:11.700 --> 32:15.930
I mean, every day you show them
what it is to be strong and-a

32:15.970 --> 32:19.700
nd in control and-
and-and sure of yourself.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.070
I mean, I just...

32:23.130 --> 32:26.340
I just hope that I can be
half as good a mom as you.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.180
Pp knock, knock, knock.

32:38.270 --> 32:43.100
I've got some dry toast,
poached egg, decaffeinated tea.

32:43.580 --> 32:44.770
Thanks.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.460
Feeling a little queasy?

32:46.540 --> 32:48.990
Yeah, but it's not just that.

32:49.020 --> 32:50.230
Just...

32:50.290 --> 32:52.730
robert is so scared,

32:52.790 --> 32:56.270
and I'm scared, and the
campaign is gonna suffer.

32:56.330 --> 32:58.160
I mean, it's just-it's just...

32:58.230 --> 33:00.080
is that what the tiff was about?

33:02.780 --> 33:05.490
I remember when I found
out I was pregnant with you.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.780
I thought your father
would have an aneurysm.

33:08.080 --> 33:13.440
Ojai was just becoming successful, and you
can imagine the handful that little sarah was.

33:14.810 --> 33:18.170
And then you were
born, and he held you.

33:18.250 --> 33:23.170
You fit from his palm
to his elbow, and...

33:24.220 --> 33:26.200
he fell in love.

33:26.930 --> 33:30.700
and my life would certainly
not be the same without you.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.520
So don't worry about the campaign.

33:35.510 --> 33:38.470
You and robert are having
your first child together.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.970
oh, god, I'm gonna
need a lot of help.

33:44.030 --> 33:45.030
That's what I'm here for.

33:45.090 --> 33:49.040
Do you realize how I'm
going to spoil that child?

33:49.140 --> 33:53.200
And then I'll hand them back to you and
criticize you for how you're raising them.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.170
I've got your briefs.

34:03.350 --> 34:07.150
I'll review the documents and the
character testimonies submitted.

34:07.710 --> 34:12.060
I assure you that I will make
my decision in a timely fashion.

34:13.090 --> 34:15.050
Counsel, you'll hear
from me when I'm done.

34:15.110 --> 34:16.250
That's it.

34:16.310 --> 34:17.900
Can I say something?

34:17.980 --> 34:20.170
Your honor, we did not
agree to personal statements.

34:20.230 --> 34:23.429
If miss whedon wishes to say
something, I'd like to hear it.

34:26.429 --> 34:28.159
I'm a good mother.

34:28.219 --> 34:29.739
I know that.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.949
I may not be able to drop them at school
every day, but I am their mother...

34:34.000 --> 34:35.719
every day.

34:35.739 --> 34:39.570
You can't punish me for
trying to parent and work.

34:39.610 --> 34:42.370
I want my kids to know the
joy that I get from my work,

34:42.429 --> 34:48.460
but it's nothing compared to the joy that
I get from being their mother every day...

34:48.540 --> 34:50.510
and they know that.

34:51.940 --> 34:54.110
Please.

34:54.190 --> 34:55.270
Thank you.

34:55.350 --> 34:57.110
I'll take that into account.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.830
so do you know what
they're saying about you?

35:05.900 --> 35:07.370
That I wore the wrong tie?

35:07.490 --> 35:09.210
No.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.390
No, they're saying that you won.

35:11.470 --> 35:15.610
"The register, " "the times, "
"the journal, " it's unanimous.

35:17.250 --> 35:21.080
And, you know, the whole time, my mind
kept drifting back to you being pregnant.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.250
Well, you couldn't tell.

35:26.270 --> 35:29.530
you know, all those,
uh, things that you...

35:30.160 --> 35:32.910
said about mup there?I woul.

35:35.740 --> 35:36.820
thank you.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.790
Look, it's not lost on me, the
sacrifices that you're making.

35:42.530 --> 35:45.210
I should have told you I was
pregnant. I shouldn't have waited.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.440
But I get why you didn'T.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.970
You're gonna be a great president.

35:50.610 --> 35:55.360
And I understood what it meant
when we decided to get married.

35:56.220 --> 36:01.120
But it's just really hard
sometimes to be happy about it.

36:01.740 --> 36:03.440
Are you happy...

36:04.070 --> 36:05.730
about the baby?

36:06.200 --> 36:08.780
Yeah, I'm really, really happy.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.170
I am.

36:12.810 --> 36:14.050
Are you?

36:17.810 --> 36:21.950
Yeah, nothing would make me happier
than starting a family with you.

36:26.110 --> 36:27.650
that was so quick.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.980
- What does it mean?
-Doesn't mean anything.

36:30.390 --> 36:31.600
Hello, people.

36:31.660 --> 36:33.110
Please be seated.

36:35.450 --> 36:40.320
I know that you are anxious,
so let's get right into it.

36:40.830 --> 36:44.080
My temporary ruling is not meant to
punish one party or the other party.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.110
It is meant to serve the best
interests of the children.

36:47.130 --> 36:50.130
Mr. Whedon has been
the primary caretaker.

36:50.470 --> 36:54.700
In order to maintain that level
of consistency and stability,

36:55.240 --> 37:01.380
I award joseph whedon full temporary
custody of paige and cooper whedon.

37:01.460 --> 37:02.920
It's effective@mmediately.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.320
Thank you, your honor.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.950
Excuse me.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.300
I'll pick them up tonight.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.250
Listen to me.

37:16.310 --> 37:18.150
It's not over, okay?

37:18.230 --> 37:19.510
It's not the end.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.700
It's not over yet, okay?

37:46.130 --> 37:47.490
mom.

37:49.380 --> 37:50.620
Kevin told you.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.070
He did.

37:54.580 --> 37:56.450
Joe's gonna be here in a minute.

37:57.230 --> 37:58.550
I know.

37:58.630 --> 38:00.390
So where are my grandkids?

38:01.610 --> 38:03.530
Um, they're upstairs getting ready.

38:05.290 --> 38:07.000
Well, let's go help 'em.

38:11.570 --> 38:12.950
Anyone know what this is about?

38:13.030 --> 38:15.670
Uh, unfortunately, I think I do.

38:15.730 --> 38:18.000
Okay, um, thank
you all for staying.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.480
I know that it's very late.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.900
Um, kitty and I
have an announcement.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.810
Robert and i are expecting.

38:27.450 --> 38:28.890
A baby.

38:30.890 --> 38:33.710
so we are in uncharted waters.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.200
It's a family issue.

38:35.260 --> 38:37.980
It's gonna be an issue, and
it's probably gonna cost us.

38:38.370 --> 38:40.160
But I'm willing to pay the price.

38:40.220 --> 38:44.140
'Cause at the end of the day,
it really shouldn't matter.

38:44.340 --> 38:46.350
You say people want tknow who I am?

38:46.430 --> 38:47.970
They're gonna find out.

38:49.090 --> 38:50.470
Okay. So, uh,

38:50.530 --> 38:55.270
I need every governor, senator,
congressman, mayor in the last 15 years-

38:55.330 --> 38:57.450
one of them must have
had a baby out of wedlock

38:57.530 --> 38:59.560
- and I want to see every
source for reactions,

38:59.620 --> 39:03.430
from constituents, election data, polls
- just anything and everything.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.320
Do you have a pen?

39:08.590 --> 39:09.720
nora.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.100
Joe.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.120
dad!

39:17.260 --> 39:18.350
Are you ready?

39:18.490 --> 39:19.910
Excellent.

39:22.030 --> 39:23.380
I'll get the big one, bud.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.140
Hey, coop, come on over
here and give me a hug.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.440
Come on.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.980
Sweetie pie, I'll see
you in a few weeks.

39:30.090 --> 39:32.410
- good-bye, grandma.
-Good-bye, sugar pie.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.210
Oh, my little man.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.490
You are going to
have such a good time.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.290
And you be a good boy, okay?

39:38.350 --> 39:39.700
Listen to your daddy.

39:39.780 --> 39:41.440
- I will.
-Have fun.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.950
Oh, I love you.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.070
where's paige?

39:55.110 --> 39:56.590
I'll go check on her.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.830
honey, your dad's here for you.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.920
Can I stay one more night?

40:15.290 --> 40:17.240
you know.

40:17.850 --> 40:23.440
I had hidden something in
here for you to find later,

40:23.500 --> 40:27.630
but I think this just
might be a better time.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.190
it's pink.

40:33.310 --> 40:35.950
Still your favorite color, right?

40:36.010 --> 40:39.600
Whenever you need to
talk about anything-

40:39.980 --> 40:42.790
caitlin's being mean at school or
you need help with your homework

40:42.870 --> 40:45.720
or you just want to
say hi, I will be there.

40:45.800 --> 40:49.290
It doesn't matter how late
it is or where I am, okay?

40:49.920 --> 40:51.410
You programmed it?

40:51.470 --> 40:57.940
My office, my cell, grandma, kitty,
uncle kevin, uncle tommy, uncle justin

40:58.030 --> 40:59.930
- they're all just a click away.

41:00.850 --> 41:03.480
These two weeks,
they're gonna go so fast.

41:22.670 --> 41:24.650
some days are rough but that's all
right they'll be well taken care of.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.390
They've always been.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.450
bye, sweetie.

41:34.510 --> 41:36.210
I'll see you soon.

41:36.370 --> 41:37.800
Hey, P.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.760
Okay, coop, let's go!

41:45.340 --> 41:47.700
okay, you two have
a good time, okay?
