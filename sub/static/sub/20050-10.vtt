00:16.768 --> 00:19.395
Boys, I'm sorry I can't
come on this one with you

00:19.478 --> 00:21.814
but my nerves
are just too shot

00:21.898 --> 00:23.775
and somebody in
this area scares
the fuck out of me.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.777
Don't worry about it,
Bubs. You stay here
and relax, all right?

00:25.860 --> 00:27.361
We can take care
of this, no problem.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.905
Just make sure
those idiots don't
get out of there

00:28.988 --> 00:31.240
until the fucking
deal's done, okay?

00:31.323 --> 00:33.952
Lahey: (From trunk)
Julian, please!
I'll do anything.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.413
I'm fucking...
(Indistinct)

00:37.496 --> 00:41.208
Randy:
Please, Julian.
I've got really bad gas!

00:41.292 --> 00:43.544
Just keep drinking until you
pass out, you fucking drunk.
(Farting)

00:43.628 --> 00:46.798
I'll give you something
to fucking chew on
right now, cuz.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.340
Over the rainbow,
motherfuckers.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.092
Let's go.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.094
All right,
let's do it.
Ricky: See you soon, Bubs.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.806
Okay, I'm going to
be over in my shed.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.432
I'll come and check
on you guys though,

00:56.515 --> 00:58.100
and I'll make sure
you have water later.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.811
Lahey:
Wait! Bubs!

00:59.894 --> 01:02.605
Don't walk away,
Bubbles, come on, bud!

01:02.688 --> 01:04.482
I'll make you a deal.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.610
Nope, sorry.
No fucking deals. No way.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.154
Randy:
Please, Bubbles,
we could die in here.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.115
It's inhumane. It's hot.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.951
For fuck's sakes, all right.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.368
Just... hang on.

01:16.452 --> 01:18.162
Look, I'll send you some...

01:18.245 --> 01:22.416
delicious roast chicken chips
down the fucking pipe here.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.543
Barb:
Bubbles?
These go great with liquor.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.211
(Crunching)

01:26.295 --> 01:28.673
Bubbles?
Ahh!

01:28.756 --> 01:30.215
Bubbles, I got back
as quick as I could.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.301
Did you... Have you
heard anything about Jim?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.512
Uhh, no I haven't.
I've been really...

01:34.595 --> 01:37.056
busy just putting chips
in my gas tank here.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.724
Lahey:
Barb! Is that you, Barb?

01:38.808 --> 01:40.309
Jim! Jim!

01:40.392 --> 01:42.061
What is he doing
in there, Bubbles?

01:42.144 --> 01:43.479
You let him out right now!

01:43.562 --> 01:44.647
Look, Barb, I can't do that.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.024
He's hard on the liquor.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.316
Lahey:
No, he's lying, Barb.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.860
I haven't even had a drink.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.653
Julian kidnapped us.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.322
Us? Wh... who
do you mean, us?

01:53.405 --> 01:54.532
Randy:
Hi, Barb.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.825
Oh, my God. Randy!

01:55.908 --> 01:57.660
Bubbles, you open
that trunk right now

01:57.743 --> 01:59.328
or you will be evicted
from this park!

01:59.411 --> 02:01.706
I can't do that, Barb,
even if I wanted to.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.041
I don't have the keys.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.667
Oh, rea...
I don't have the keys.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.712
Oh, really?
What, you mean
these keys?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.505
I'm coming, Jim.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.507
Look, Barb.
You can't open that.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.885
Look, there's more at
play here than you know.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.177
Oh, Jim.
(Grunting)

02:15.260 --> 02:18.056
What the hell is going on?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.850
Jesus Murphy.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.561
Randy and I are both
on the force now, Barb.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.397
What? Oh my God,
you are drunk.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.606
(Slurring)
No, I'm not.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.692
What the hell
has happened here?

02:29.775 --> 02:31.610
You promised me that
you were going to be
supervising the park.

02:31.694 --> 02:35.031
Well, the liquor's
supervising the
park, Barb.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.033
The liquor's
supervising the park,

02:37.116 --> 02:38.701
and it's supervising me,

02:38.784 --> 02:40.536
and it's supervising Randy,

02:40.619 --> 02:42.663
and it's supervising this too.

02:42.747 --> 02:44.707
No!
Jim! Jim, Jim, Jim.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.125
Jim, let him
go right now.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.960
I can't do that, Barb.

02:48.044 --> 02:50.838
Bubbles, are you
hungry, bud?

02:50.922 --> 02:53.173
(Straining)
Uhh, a little bit. Why?

02:53.257 --> 02:57.344
'Cause we're going
to an all-you-can-eat
shit buffet.

02:57.428 --> 03:00.639
(Theme music)

03:39.137 --> 03:41.305
Well, things are all set up.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.099
We've got Snoop's guys, they're
on their way with the boat

03:43.182 --> 03:45.267
and I'm feeling pretty
fucking good about everything.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.478
Now all we've got to do
is just stick to the plan.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.480
(Phone ringing)

03:49.563 --> 03:51.607
What's going on?

03:51.690 --> 03:53.442
Ricky:
I fucked up, man.
I've got to stop for gas.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.779
No, no, no, no.
You're not... Ricky. Rick...

03:56.862 --> 03:58.530
For fuck's sakes.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.952
(Bubbles whimpering)

04:03.035 --> 04:05.037
Bubbles:
Please, Mr. Lahey,
please let me out of here.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.665
I don't like the dark!
(Whimper)

04:07.748 --> 04:10.668
Oh, it's not very nice
in there, is it, Bubbles?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.963
Make sure the shit
spiders don't get you, bud.

04:14.046 --> 04:17.382
Bubbles: (Screaming)
What? Shit spiders?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.052
Good day, gentlemen.

04:20.136 --> 04:23.472
I'd like to have every
goddamn ounce of liquor

04:23.555 --> 04:25.808
and every fucking gun

04:25.891 --> 04:27.852
you've got in the goddamn joint.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.478
What the fuck are
you talking about?

04:29.561 --> 04:30.688
You better back
the fuck off

04:30.771 --> 04:32.690
or you'll get
knocked the fuck out.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.234
That's right, bitch.
Who the fuck do you
think you are anyways?

04:35.317 --> 04:36.735
Good idea.
(Gunshot)

04:36.819 --> 04:39.571
(Mixed shouting)

04:39.655 --> 04:41.657
Are you fucking crazy?
What the fuck?

04:41.740 --> 04:43.283
I don't know.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.828
Am I?
Man:
(Moaning in pain)

04:47.246 --> 04:50.374
Are you calling
the liquor crazy?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.917
Huh?

04:52.001 --> 04:53.669
You're fucked up.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.088
You've got beautiful eyes.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.548
Fuck off, Lahey.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.508
Okay, boys...
Guns now!

04:59.591 --> 05:01.760
Give me the
fucking guns now!

05:01.844 --> 05:05.347
(Indistinct chatter)
Sammy O.G:
Jeez, cuz.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.725
Yo, this shit
right here, cuz?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.393
This shit is sweet and salty.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.644
That shit's
pretty nice, eh?

05:10.728 --> 05:13.189
Yeah...
It's the shit.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.439
Julian:
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

05:14.523 --> 05:16.316
I told you not to stop!

05:16.400 --> 05:18.402
I needed fucking
gas, Julian.
It's not my fault.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.862
Sammy wanted to
try some pepperoni.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.363
This shit is tight, cuz.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.033
Oi! Would you mind
putting that cigarette out

05:24.116 --> 05:27.078
before you blow us all
up, you fucking dummy!

05:27.161 --> 05:29.705
It's not a fucking cigarette,
it's a joint,<i> dummy.</i>

05:29.788 --> 05:32.166
And you can't fucking
blow yourself up at the
gas pumps with a cigarette.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.294
I saw it on Myth-dusters.
So tongue my tasty balls.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.713
It is gas vapour and...

05:37.796 --> 05:39.715
an ignition source.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.717
You're damn right
you could blow us up.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.095
Oh, my fuck, yeah. Look at me.
I'm going to blow up the world.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.554
A little bit gas and
a fucking weed joint.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.972
Ricky, what are you
doing? Ricky, get up.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.058
Get up, get up, Ricky!
Man:
Sir!

05:49.141 --> 05:52.603
Extinguish the cigarette
and step away from the pumps!

05:52.686 --> 05:55.022
Holy fuck, man.
Everybody calm the fuck down.
Nothing can happen here.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.399
Put it out now or
I'm calling the cops.
All right. I'll put it out.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.568
Just let me have
a couple more drags.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.113
Call the goddamn
cops on him anyway!

06:02.196 --> 06:03.405
Julian:
Hey, hey, listen.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.740
Here, want this?
Fucking take it!

06:04.823 --> 06:06.200
Julian:
Ricky, that's enough!

06:06.284 --> 06:07.743
Listen, my friend here
is on medication, okay?

06:07.826 --> 06:09.411
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.914
You apologize to
these nice people.

06:11.997 --> 06:15.126
All right. I'm sorry
that you two <i> are so fucked!</i>

06:15.209 --> 06:16.919
That's enough!

06:17.002 --> 06:18.545
All right, okay, don't
got to call the cops.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.922
We're leaving now,
anyway. All right?

06:20.005 --> 06:21.799
(Phone ringing)
Thanks, man.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.093
What the fuck is
wrong with this world?
Get in the fucking car.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.344
Fucking idiots.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.930
(Phone ringing)

06:28.013 --> 06:30.641
Yo, what up, T?
...so fucking a-scared
of everything.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.434
Yo, Julian, man.
Mr. Lahey just busted
in the trailer, man

06:32.517 --> 06:34.645
and shot Mr. Green in the leg.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.897
He fucking took off with
a bunch of guns and liquor, man.

06:36.981 --> 06:38.523
Julian: (On phone)
<i>What? Are you</i>
<i>fucking kidding me?</i>

06:38.607 --> 06:40.276
<i>Where's Bubbles?</i>
I don't know, man.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.485
It sounded like
he was in the trunk.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.112
Oh, my fuck.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.446
All right, all right.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.823
We've got to go.
We've got to go!

06:45.906 --> 06:47.449
Get in your fucking car
and let's go!

06:47.532 --> 06:50.286
What's happening?
We've got to go!

06:50.369 --> 06:53.164
Oh fuck, don't blow
yourself up there, dickhead.
(Engine ignition)

06:53.247 --> 06:54.665
Fuck's sakes.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.294
Cory:
(Speaking indistinctly)

06:58.377 --> 07:00.004
Fuck.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.214
Sammy O.G.:
Hold on!

07:02.298 --> 07:04.133
Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck!

07:04.216 --> 07:06.468
Julian:
Bubs, I'm on my way.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.719
Sammy O.G.:
Ah..

07:09.347 --> 07:11.765
(Siren wailing,
engine revving)

07:14.810 --> 07:16.979
Okay, Cory, Jacob,
I'm going to
fucking pull over.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.190
When I do,
you guys jump out,

07:19.273 --> 07:21.400
fucking tell the cop
to fuck off, tell him
to suck your cock.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.361
Do whatever you have
to do, just make them
fucking chase you

07:23.443 --> 07:25.529
so you get them away
from us, all right?
What?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.739
No talking, boys.
This is your fuck-up.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.492
You're going to have to make
it look good. And make them
fucking go after you.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.912
Ready?
Yeah... fuck...

07:33.996 --> 07:35.497
Right...
Bail, bail, bail!

07:35.580 --> 07:37.457
Good luck, boys.
Good luck.

07:37.541 --> 07:42.338
Cory & Jacob:
Hey, you! Fuck you... pig!
Suck my di-i-ick.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.672
Jacob:
Okay, go, go, go. Run.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.674
Where the fuck
are you guys going?

07:45.757 --> 07:47.134
What are they doing?

07:47.218 --> 07:49.387
This is some bullshit, cuz.
It didn't work!

07:49.469 --> 07:51.180
Fuck!

07:51.263 --> 07:55.184
(Siren wailing)
Oh, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

07:55.267 --> 07:56.768
Jesus Christ, Ricky.
(Turn signal clicking)

07:59.438 --> 08:00.981
(Siren stops)

08:04.276 --> 08:05.361
Hey.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.987
Hey, officer.
Can I help you?

08:07.071 --> 08:08.864
Mind telling me
who you were talking
to on the phone

08:08.947 --> 08:11.242
that was so
important you needed
to break the law?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.535
Uhh, I wasn't talking
on the phone, man.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.537
Mind stepping out
the vehicle, sir?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.126
Hey, what's in that
glass, right there?

08:21.210 --> 08:23.379
Fuck!

08:23.462 --> 08:25.714
It's just root beer, man.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.716
What's in these boxes?

08:27.799 --> 08:30.219
Uh, it's just lobster.
I'm just heading
to the grocery store.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.887
Grocery store's
back that way.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.056
Do you mind if
I take a look inside
these boxes, sir?

08:34.139 --> 08:35.557
Well, they're...

08:35.640 --> 08:38.394
Hey, are those dumb fucks
coming back or what?

08:38.477 --> 08:40.229
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck 'em!

08:40.312 --> 08:43.565
Motherfucker, go! Shit.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.109
They're all... I'm
the delivery guy, man.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.360
They're all
shrink-wrapped up.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.237
I don't know.
You can smell them.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.239
You can smell them, man.
Just open one box
for me. Come on.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.074
Just open one box?
Just one box.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.203
Uhh... Which... This one
here or this one here?

08:56.287 --> 08:58.747
It doesn't matter.
Just open a box.
Officer!

08:58.830 --> 09:00.665
What the fuck are you doing?
There's a huge fucking
accident over there

09:00.749 --> 09:02.251
on Cole Harbour Road...
What are you guys
talking about?

09:02.334 --> 09:04.295
It's fucking bad,
people are mangled...
What?

09:04.378 --> 09:05.963
...there's these two
fucking weird dudes
waving guns around,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.714
threatening people.
Bang, bang!
Are you serious?

09:07.798 --> 09:09.508
Jesus Christ, nothing
came in over the radio.
Yeah!

09:09.591 --> 09:11.469
You're going to wait
for this to come in
over the radio, man?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.471
People are fucking dying!
Get the fuck over there now!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.431
Bodies everywhere!
All right, all right,
all right, God damn it.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.724
Wait right here.
Unit 27. I need back-up.
...small engine repair.

09:17.808 --> 09:21.812
We've got a... 10-54
on Cole Harbour Road,
possible 10-32.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.982
Dumb fuck.
A possible 10-32.
(Engine ignition)

09:25.065 --> 09:27.443
(Siren wails)
That was a real
cheers, motherfucker.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.445
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

09:29.528 --> 09:32.448
I don't know how
you do it, man,
but thanks, buddy.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.283
Cops are fucking dumb.

09:34.366 --> 09:37.286
We're down two guys because
of fucking two other dummies.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.745
Let's go, let's go.
Fuck's sakes.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.038
(Whimper)
Where are the
fucking boys?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.706
I don't know.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.208
And where's this fucking
thing going down, Bubbles?

09:43.292 --> 09:44.418
I don't know!
I don't know anything!

09:44.502 --> 09:46.044
Really?
(Gunshot)

09:46.128 --> 09:48.088
(Whimpering)
I'm not fucking
around, Bubbles!

09:48.172 --> 09:50.382
I know, I know
you're not. I see that.

09:50.466 --> 09:53.010
But... I'm not afraid
of you, Mr. Lahey.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.347
I know there's a good
person in there behind
this liquor veil.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.056
I know that you
would never shoot me.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.599
Oh?
Bubbles,

09:59.683 --> 10:02.060
I just watched
Mr. Lahey shoot Mr. Green

10:02.144 --> 10:03.854
not 20 minutes ago.
What?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.356
We're not fucking around.
What...

10:05.439 --> 10:07.274
Right, Mr. Lahey?
Right, Randy.

10:07.358 --> 10:08.733
Bubbles,

10:08.817 --> 10:11.111
I'm just going to ask
you one more time

10:11.195 --> 10:13.071
to take us to where
the boys are,

10:13.155 --> 10:15.157
or the cops
are going to go

10:15.240 --> 10:16.534
and you're
going to have

10:16.616 --> 10:18.577
a great big fucking
hole in your leg.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.870
(Whispering)
Okay.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.580
Yeah.
(Seagulls cawing)

10:21.663 --> 10:23.123
I got you, kid.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.583
A'ight, listen up, boys.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.293
They're pulling up to
the drop point now, cuz.

10:26.377 --> 10:27.961
Let's do this shit.
Right on, man.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.588
This calls for a
celebratory fucking joint.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.298
Ha-ha! My nigger.
(Phone rings)

10:31.382 --> 10:33.551
No, no, no, boys.
We've got to go.
Fuck that.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.053
Bubbles: (on phone)
<i>Julian!</i>
What's up, Bubs?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.472
Lahey and Randy got out.
They've got me trapped
in the fucking trunk now.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.349
How the fuck did they get out?

10:40.432 --> 10:43.268
Barb Lahey fucked
everything up.
I'm sorry, Julian.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.188
I'm scared, I've never seen
Lahey this crazy before.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.939
All right... hang tight.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.108
We're coming for you.
Ricky:
Yeah, Bubs.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.610
I don't know if you
have to, Julian.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.278
I'm pretty sure
we're on our way to you.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.489
You told them where we are?

10:55.573 --> 10:57.533
Well, he had a fucking
gun pressed to my leg.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.493
Yeah, sorry about that!

10:59.577 --> 11:01.620
Look, just go get
the deal done.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.997
I'm going to try to MacGyver
my way out of here.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.957
Julian:
All right.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.126
Lahey's coming for us.
We've got to go, boys.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.841
All right, can you
untie that, Sammy?

11:14.925 --> 11:17.886
Motherfucker,
I don't even roll
my own blunts. Shit.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.638
What the fuck?
You can't untie a rope?

11:19.721 --> 11:21.681
Ricky, untie it.
Fuck's sakes.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.060
Julian:
Jesus, man.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.355
It's all fucking
wind-cocked.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.067
Just fucking untie it.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.860
Do you want me
to shoot it off?

11:33.944 --> 11:35.987
Put the fucking
gun away, Sammy!
Asshole, fuck off.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.991
For fuck's
sakes, Ricky.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.456
All right.
Are we good?

11:45.539 --> 11:47.165
We're fucking ready to move!
What are you waiting for?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.503
Julian:
Man, that boat is killer.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.796
Yeah. Two million dollars.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.548
Both:
Two million?
Yeah.

11:54.632 --> 11:56.925
Holy fuck.
(Indistinct)

11:57.008 --> 11:58.636
Holy...

11:58.718 --> 12:00.220
That's the kind of
money I want, man.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.681
Fucking right.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.516
(Gunshots)

12:04.600 --> 12:06.393
Fuck!
Who the fuck is
shooting at us?

12:06.477 --> 12:08.019
Julian:
Get rid of them!

12:08.103 --> 12:10.021
Ah! Fuck!

12:12.774 --> 12:15.152
Jesus Christ!
(Engine whining)

12:16.778 --> 12:18.196
Julian:
Fuck!

12:18.280 --> 12:20.031
...motherfuckers
shooting at us right now.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.700
Be ready to deal
with that shit.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.786
You know what? Fuck it!
Spray them fools.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.706
(Automatic weapon fire)

12:27.789 --> 12:29.625
(Laughing)
Fuck off!

12:34.963 --> 12:37.341
Sammy O.G:
(Indistinct)
Julian: Yeah!

12:38.883 --> 12:40.719
Sorry, man.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.220
(Gunshot)

12:42.304 --> 12:44.055
Holy fuck, it sucks
to get shot in the hand.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.557
It really fucking hurts!

12:45.641 --> 12:47.934
Come on, guys. I led
you to the fucking spot.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.728
Can't you just
let me go, please?

12:49.811 --> 12:52.439
Oh, we can't let
you go yet, Bubbaroo.

12:52.523 --> 12:56.901
The festivities are just
fucking getting started, bud.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.404
You know...
I always thought

12:59.488 --> 13:02.032
that you had to let the
liquor do the thinking.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.743
But you know what?
It's not enough.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.953
You have to let the liquor

13:07.037 --> 13:11.208
take ab-so-lute control.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.460
That's the key to success.

13:13.544 --> 13:14.961
Down the hatch, bud.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.588
I can't chug
all this, Mr. Lahey.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.048
You can't chug all...

13:18.131 --> 13:20.384
Randy, don't fucking
question me!

13:20.467 --> 13:22.594
I know what the fucking
hell I'm doing!

13:22.678 --> 13:24.179
Chug the fucking thing!

13:24.262 --> 13:26.056
Mr. Lahey, you're
having a liquor surge.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.849
I don't give a fuck
if I'm having a
fucking liquor sur...

13:27.932 --> 13:30.268
Randy, don't
fucking question...
(Angry muttering)

13:30.352 --> 13:31.978
Just drink it, Randy.
Just drink it.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.313
You're fucking
right, Bubbles.

13:33.397 --> 13:37.192
Your fucking turn, bud.
(Panting)

13:37.275 --> 13:39.819
Yes, sir, you're going
to thank me for this.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.488
Oh, Mr. Lahey,
I can't drink...

13:41.572 --> 13:43.615
Yes, you fucking
can, Bubbles.

13:43.699 --> 13:44.949
There you are.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.035
Hey, don't think
about it, Bubbles.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.495
Don't think about it.

13:48.579 --> 13:50.163
Just do it, bud.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.374
Just do it.
(Gulping)

13:52.457 --> 13:54.959
Go with the
liquor, buddy.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.920
Go with the liquor.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.465
(Coughing)

14:03.385 --> 14:04.969
Holy fuck!

14:05.053 --> 14:07.681
That's everything.
You got it, man.
You got it.

14:07.765 --> 14:08.973
Nice.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.310
That is a done deal,
motherfuckers.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.645
Good doing
business with y'all.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.480
Here is your
motherfuckin' money.

14:15.564 --> 14:16.981
Julian:
Right on.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.151
Yeah.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.654
Sammy O.G.:
Minus the bail
money you owe me.

14:22.738 --> 14:27.826
Ricky:
Holy fuck!
(Laughter)

14:27.909 --> 14:29.244
Oh, man.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.830
Hey! Motherfucker,
you crying right now?

14:31.913 --> 14:33.665
No, man. It's just the
most beautiful thing

14:33.749 --> 14:35.709
I've ever seen in my life.

14:35.793 --> 14:38.503
Oh, go ahead,
count that shit, make
sure it's all there.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.965
No, we're good, man.
I trust you guys.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.218
Right on.
All right, man.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.846
(Indistinct)
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.890
Yo, untie them fools.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.684
(Motor roars)

14:52.768 --> 14:54.603
Shit.
(Laughs)

14:54.686 --> 14:56.480
Awesome, man. Awesome.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.360
Cheers, man!

15:05.113 --> 15:06.865
Man, this money's
fucking awesome.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.700
It's pretty
fucked-looking, though.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.535
Man, it's real, man.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.370
And we're getting
fucking wasted tonight.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.331
Ricky:
Fucking right.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.915
Wait now. We've got
a bogey incoming at us.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.293
Ricky:
What? Is it the fucking cops?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.211
Lahey: (Tuneless singing)
Bubbles: (Indistinct shouting)

15:20.295 --> 15:22.213
Julian:
No, it's Lahey.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.883
(Gunshots)
Fuck! Shit, get down!

15:24.966 --> 15:27.385
Ohh, fuck! I'm shot! Again!
Bubbles:
Boys, I'm fucking wasted!

15:27.469 --> 15:30.054
They've got Bubbles.
Stay down, Ricky.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.098
Ricky:
What the fuck are you
idiots doing? Fuck off!

15:32.182 --> 15:34.392
Lahey:
Stop shooting at us!

15:34.476 --> 15:36.436
Bubbles:
Don't shoot, Ricky, don't shoot!
Julian: Don't shoot, Ricky.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.272
Fuck, stay down!
Bubbles:
(Whimpering, yelling)

15:39.356 --> 15:41.900
Bubbles:
He's got me, he's got me, boys.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.735
Julian:
What the fuck do
you want, Lahey?

15:43.819 --> 15:46.905
Lahey:
Okay boys, throw
your guns in the water!

15:46.988 --> 15:48.657
You put your fucking
guns down, right now.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.576
The liquor has control
of the situation.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.077
Okay, don't fucking
hurt Bubbles.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.579
I won't hurt Bubbles

15:54.663 --> 15:56.456
but I'm going to
fucking shoot you, Julian.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.709
I just shot Mr. Green

15:58.792 --> 16:01.795
so I'm not going to have
any fucking problem
shooting you, bud.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.839
He did too,
and he blasted him.
(Whimpering)

16:03.922 --> 16:05.423
For fuck's sakes!

16:05.507 --> 16:07.425
Lahey:
Throw your fucking
guns over, boys.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.635
(Splashes)

16:08.719 --> 16:09.969
Thank you very much.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.263
Now fucking throw
me over that money

16:12.347 --> 16:15.016
that you know you've got
in the fucking bag, Julian.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.268
Not a fucking chance,
you asshole.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.397
Julian, do you know
what a shit bubble is?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.649
Julian:
What?
A shit bubble.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.694
Now, Julian, a normal bubble,

16:25.777 --> 16:27.612
when you put it in the water,

16:27.696 --> 16:29.280
kind of rises to the top,

16:29.364 --> 16:31.491
but a shit bubble, Julian...

16:31.575 --> 16:35.119
a shit bubble sinks right
to the goddamn bottom.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.705
You fucking
leave him alone!

16:36.788 --> 16:38.289
Bubbles:
Boys, don't let him
put me in the water.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.083
I'm fucking wasted!

16:40.166 --> 16:42.460
You're drunk?
I'm fucking shot twice
over here, Bubbles!

16:42.544 --> 16:43.670
Bubbles:
I didn't want to get drunk.

16:43.754 --> 16:46.130
I'm going to count to ten

16:46.214 --> 16:48.800
and then I'm going to
start carbonating the ocean

16:48.884 --> 16:50.343
with shit bubbles.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.303
Ten, nine,

16:52.387 --> 16:53.805
eight, seven...
Ricky:
Fuck off!

16:53.889 --> 16:55.056
We need music!

16:55.139 --> 16:56.850
Hey, Julian!
(Music plays)

16:56.934 --> 16:58.936
Have you got a
Speedo on under there

16:59.018 --> 17:01.980
or are you more
of a thong man?

17:02.063 --> 17:03.398
Would you go fuck yourself!

17:03.481 --> 17:04.983
Lahey:
Oh, doesn't matter anyway,

17:05.066 --> 17:07.109
because little Bubbles
is going fucking swimming

17:07.193 --> 17:08.737
if you don't send me
the fucking money!

17:08.819 --> 17:10.739
No, Julian. Don't let him
put me in the ocean, Julian!

17:10.821 --> 17:12.240
Lahey:
Come on, Julian.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.825
Bubbles:
I'll sink!

17:13.909 --> 17:15.410
Six...
Give us the
money, Julian!

17:15.492 --> 17:17.161
five... four...

17:17.244 --> 17:18.538
Frig off, Ricky!
Three...

17:18.622 --> 17:20.123
Wait, wait,
wait! You...

17:20.205 --> 17:21.833
You give him
to us and we'll give
you the money.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.086
♪ Crazy Bubbles ♪
Julian...

17:25.169 --> 17:28.423
♪ In the brine ♪
I can't go in the brine.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.174
♪ Make me happy ♪
Come on, Julian.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.844
Give him the money, Julian.
It's fucking Bubbles here.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.346
Why do you have to be
such a fucking
asshole all the time?

17:35.430 --> 17:37.098
Four...
Julian, I can't...

17:37.181 --> 17:38.683
Julian, I'm fucking serious.
Don't fuck with me.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.518
Give him the
fucking money!
...all right! All right!

17:40.602 --> 17:42.353
Lahey:
Three...
Hang on, Bubs.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.230
Fu-u-uck!

17:44.314 --> 17:45.690
Give me the money, Julian...

17:45.774 --> 17:48.109
Hey, Randers. Holy...

17:48.192 --> 17:49.486
Ricky:
Let him go! Let him go!

17:49.569 --> 17:51.195
Lahey:
We're fucking rich, Randy!

17:51.279 --> 17:52.697
We fucking
made it, Randy.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.199
Rick, you fucking...

17:55.283 --> 17:57.035
Man: (on radio)
<i>We've got reports</i>
<i>of gunshots offshore.</i>

17:57.118 --> 17:58.787
Which one of you shot me, huh?
Was it you, Randy?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.204
Was it fucking you?

18:00.288 --> 18:02.081
I'll shoot you frigging
again. Frig off!

18:02.165 --> 18:04.042
Oww. Okay, Bubs.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.710
Julian:
Come on, buddy.
We've got you, buddy.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.796
Bubbles:
(Whimpering)
Come on, buddy.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.923
Lahey:
Randy. Put your
fucking gun up, Randy.

18:10.007 --> 18:12.550
You're fucking dead.
You are fucking dead.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.219
Man: (on radio)
<i>Chief Green, suspects</i>
<i>located. Moving in.</i>

18:15.303 --> 18:17.597
I finally fucking
beat you, bud.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.599
You lose, bud.
(Boat approaching)

18:19.683 --> 18:21.059
Man: (On loudspeaker)
Everyone drop your weapons

18:21.142 --> 18:23.436
and put your hands
in the air! Now!

18:23.520 --> 18:24.729
Listen, we are not armed!

18:24.813 --> 18:26.481
We were fucking cruising around.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.608
These idiots pulled up and
shot us for no fucking reason!

18:28.692 --> 18:30.568
Man: (On loudspeaker)
All right, gentlemen,
put your hands up now.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.570
(Whimpers)
Hands where I can see them.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.155
We got our hands up.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.824
Sir, put the
beverage down,

18:35.907 --> 18:38.159
and put your
hands up.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.912
What the fuck are
you talking about?
I'm shot, you asshole!

18:40.996 --> 18:42.580
Man: (on radio)
<i>Scene is secure here, chief.</i>

18:42.664 --> 18:44.082
<i>We're bringing</i>
<i>both boats in now.</i>

18:44.165 --> 18:45.917
<i>You might want to have</i>
<i>an EMT on stand-by.</i>

18:46.001 --> 18:47.585
<i>We've got a couple</i>
<i>of gunshot wounds here. Over.</i>

18:47.669 --> 18:49.504
Yeah, take your time.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.965
Let them bleed out
for a little bit.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.592
Why the fuck are
we in handcuffs,
you fucking dummies?

18:54.676 --> 18:56.636
We were out there fishing,
minding our own business.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.430
These drunk pricks
show up and shoot us
for no fucking reason!

18:59.514 --> 19:00.974
That's a pile of
sheep shit, Ricky.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.267
We were making a
shit-izen's arrest.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.020
Multiple gun
fights out at sea.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.022
Pretty subtle, guys.
Ah, fuck off, George.

19:07.105 --> 19:10.274
Ah, fuck!
This was a big score, chief.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.693
Get all of this
down to evidence

19:11.776 --> 19:13.444
and we'll get
everything sorted out.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.279
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

19:19.534 --> 19:20.911
Chief Green.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.121
I'm Detective Hartford,
Internal Affairs.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.789
I'll take these
from you, sir.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.958
Put your hands
behind your back.
Excuse me?

19:27.042 --> 19:29.419
No, we've been watching you
for a long time, George.

19:29.502 --> 19:33.798
Money laundering, insurance
fraud, theft of evidence.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.341
We've got it all
on tape too,

19:35.425 --> 19:37.969
thanks to the awesome work
of Officer Johnson here.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.971
You're going
to jail, George.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.514
A wire, Ted?

19:41.598 --> 19:43.349
Seriously?

19:43.433 --> 19:46.477
You miserable little shit.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.646
You're the one who should
be investigated, not me.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.691
Oh, I was being
investigated, George.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.651
But I sucked my way out.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.903
Have fun in jail.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.154
Fuck you!

19:58.073 --> 19:59.490
You motherfucker!

19:59.574 --> 20:01.576
You little
bag-sucking whore!

20:01.659 --> 20:03.036
Get the fuck back here!

20:03.120 --> 20:04.662
Come here,
you cocksucker!

20:04.746 --> 20:06.497
I'm going to tear
you a new one!

20:06.581 --> 20:08.499
I'm going to shit
down your fucking neck!

20:08.583 --> 20:12.003
(Playing "Amazing Grace"
on harmonica)

20:17.592 --> 20:19.094
You know...

20:19.177 --> 20:21.679
a lot of non-believers...

20:21.763 --> 20:26.059
they think of people who talk
to the liquor are crazy.

20:26.143 --> 20:28.686
But, you know,
they don't realize

20:28.770 --> 20:33.691
that not only is the
liquor a powerful entity,

20:33.775 --> 20:36.527
it is an irresistible force.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.029
It is all-knowing.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.281
It is all-loving.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.909
Talking to the liquor

20:42.993 --> 20:45.954
is like talking to God.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.705
Mr. Lahey's been
really different

20:47.789 --> 20:49.874
since he got back
on the liquor this time.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.876
It's worrying me.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.337
Even though he hasn't
had a drink in weeks,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.756
he says that the liquor's
still talking to him,

20:56.840 --> 20:59.134
it's telling him what
to do and how to think.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.969
It's weird!

21:01.052 --> 21:03.763
He's even talking about
building a liquor altar,

21:03.847 --> 21:06.265
whatever in the frig that is.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.558
We just got goddamn lucky,

21:07.642 --> 21:09.727
there's no other
fucking way to say it.

21:09.811 --> 21:13.231
You know, they didn't
have any evidence
tying us to a crime

21:13.314 --> 21:16.400
technically, so they had
no choice but to let us
go, thank fuck.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.778
It was a bump in
the road for sure

21:18.862 --> 21:21.656
but at least now
I can get re-focused on
my pizza sauce business,

21:21.739 --> 21:24.075
keep my head down,
work my nuts off

21:24.159 --> 21:26.577
and just lead
a clean, honest life.

21:26.661 --> 21:30.748
You know, we did make a fucking
lot of money but at the end of
the day it was dirty money

21:30.832 --> 21:33.751
and I'd rather not have
anything to do with it.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.920
And Ricky and Julian
completely agree.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.172
(Click of lighter)

21:37.255 --> 21:39.799
(Puffing)

21:39.883 --> 21:41.843
The whole doing things legit

21:41.926 --> 21:44.303
and being honest shit
is pretty fucking cool,
I guess, but...

21:44.387 --> 21:45.763
I just can't stop thinking

21:45.847 --> 21:47.306
about how much money
we made in 45 days.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.766
We're never going
to make that kind of money

21:48.850 --> 21:50.852
making goddamn
pizza sauce but...

21:50.935 --> 21:52.520
yeah, I mean...

21:52.603 --> 21:54.814
it is pretty fucking cool
to be honest, I guess.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.607
For Bubbles I mean.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.109
(Squirrel chirps)

21:58.193 --> 22:00.111
Seriously?

22:00.195 --> 22:02.780
The little fucker thinks he's
so fucking funny, doesn't he?

22:02.864 --> 22:04.282
(Chirping continues)
Don't move.

22:04.365 --> 22:05.533
Don't make a fucking sound.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.207
(Gunshots)

22:12.290 --> 22:15.293
All that fucking money
and it was mine.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.045
Well, it was all of ours

22:17.128 --> 22:19.797
but I had it right
in my fucking hands.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.632
I'm going to get it back.

22:21.716 --> 22:24.302
I've just got to figure out
how I'm going to do that.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.553
It's all I can think about.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.139
It's driving me fucking nuts.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.807
Fuck's sakes.

22:32.102 --> 22:34.478
Hm. Well, I should
have known better

22:34.562 --> 22:35.730
than to listen to Randy

22:35.813 --> 22:37.232
and I should know better

22:37.315 --> 22:39.734
than to listen to
Bubbles, Ricky and Julian.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.319
But, actually,

22:41.402 --> 22:45.823
Julian and I
have had long negotiations

22:45.907 --> 22:47.992
over the last few evenings

22:48.076 --> 22:49.994
and we've, uh...

22:50.078 --> 22:51.495
we've come to an agreement.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.998
He has promised that
they're going to focus

22:54.082 --> 22:55.708
on Bubbles' pizza sauce business

22:55.792 --> 22:59.170
and, after all,
that's good for the park and...

22:59.254 --> 23:01.380
we may have to have more...

23:01.464 --> 23:03.341
negotiations...

23:03.424 --> 23:05.509
moving forward but...

23:05.593 --> 23:09.889
I'm quite happy
with the arrangement.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.725
Hey, I've got no comment
about Barb Lahey.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.270
What's important is I'm
back with Ricky and Bubbles,

23:15.353 --> 23:18.022
you know, and I'd...
pretty much do anything

23:18.106 --> 23:19.565
for those two fucking guys.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.192
(Sighs)

23:23.153 --> 23:24.695
Fuck off with the camera, guys.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.281
I'm not going to tell you again.

23:26.364 --> 23:27.782
The only reason I'm in here

23:27.865 --> 23:29.033
is because
I wasn't blowing anybody.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.868
And now I'm in here,

23:30.952 --> 23:33.204
I'm probably going to have
to do it just to stay alive.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.373
Is that what you want me
to say? That I'm going to
be somebody's bitch?

23:35.456 --> 23:37.750
Fuck you and everyone like you.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.543
Fucking gobs of shit.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.296
Normally...

23:41.379 --> 23:43.965
I'd be pretty stressed out
in a situation like this,

23:44.048 --> 23:45.549
but the liquor said:

23:45.633 --> 23:48.303
"This is all going to work out."

23:48.386 --> 23:50.013
It told me not to worry,

23:51.973 --> 23:54.725
(Whispering)
I'm going to walk out of here

23:54.809 --> 23:57.395
and that money,
that's all going to be mine.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.563
And Randy and I, we're going
to get married in Ireland,

23:59.647 --> 24:01.274
just like we planned,

24:01.358 --> 24:04.527
and everyone's going
to live happily ever after.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.654
That's what the liquor said.

24:06.737 --> 24:07.905
Yeah.

24:07.989 --> 24:12.410
Praise be thy Lord,
the liquor.

24:12.493 --> 24:16.664
<i>Benedicium dominum</i>
