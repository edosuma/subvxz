WEBVTT

00:00.511 --> 00:01.593
(exhales)

00:01.595 --> 00:02.744
(exhales)

00:02.746 --> 00:05.030
Labor sucks, huh?
Yeah.

00:05.032 --> 00:06.531
That fun-sounding name?

00:06.533 --> 00:08.166
It's totally misleading.

00:08.167 --> 00:09.217
(chuckles)

00:09.219 --> 00:10.385
Better have this baby soon.

00:10.387 --> 00:12.187
You know my
mom's rule:

00:12.189 --> 00:14.389
Nothing good happens
after 2:00 a.m.

00:14.391 --> 00:15.474
I don't buy it.

00:15.476 --> 00:18.010
Just like I don't buy
what her son told me:

00:18.012 --> 00:19.611
"Let's go away
for one last weekend

00:19.613 --> 00:20.946
"before the baby comes.

00:20.948 --> 00:22.564
We'll be fine!"

00:22.566 --> 00:24.483
Well, I hate
to point fingers,

00:24.485 --> 00:26.618
but you should
never listen to me.

00:26.620 --> 00:27.819
You know that.

00:27.821 --> 00:29.204
That's my bad.

00:30.957 --> 00:32.273
Oh!

00:32.275 --> 00:33.709
Here comes  another one.
Already?

00:33.711 --> 00:34.876
Yeah. Yeah yep.
Okay, okay, okay.

00:34.878 --> 00:36.611
We should get you to
the hospital. Come on.

00:36.613 --> 00:37.963
THE MOTHER:
Okay.

00:37.965 --> 00:39.131
TED:
Oh, here we go.

00:39.133 --> 00:42.584
Sho-sho-shoes,
baby-baby-baby...

00:45.254 --> 00:47.672
You guys can't still see where
Marshall slapped me, can you?

00:47.674 --> 00:50.342
Your face looks like
a "don't walk" signal.

00:50.344 --> 00:51.727
Your face looks like
a photo negative

00:51.729 --> 00:53.011
of the Hamburger Helper box.

00:53.013 --> 00:54.846
A palm reader could
tell Marshall's future

00:54.848 --> 00:56.481
by studying your face.

00:56.483 --> 00:58.800
The phrase "talk to the hand
'cause the face ain't listening"

00:58.802 --> 00:59.901
doesn't work for you

00:59.903 --> 01:01.853
because the hand
is on your face.

01:01.855 --> 01:04.572
A simple "yes"
would've sufficed.

01:05.241 --> 01:06.658
LILY:
Oh, baby,

01:06.660 --> 01:08.309
I missed you so much.

01:08.311 --> 01:09.861
I am so angry!

01:09.863 --> 01:12.647
I am gonna tear you
apart tonight.

01:12.649 --> 01:13.865
I am gonna
tear you

01:13.867 --> 01:15.367
apart tonight!
Okay, okay.

01:15.369 --> 01:16.985
Look, we said
that we wouldn't fight

01:16.987 --> 01:19.638
until the gang was all done
hanging out, remember?

01:19.640 --> 01:21.823
NARRATOR: <i>Ever since Lily</i>
<i>heard that Marshall</i>

01:21.825 --> 01:23.491
<i>had accepted an offer</i>
<i>to be a judge,</i>

01:23.493 --> 01:25.961
<i>thus jeopardizing</i>
<i>their planned year in Italy,</i>

01:25.963 --> 01:27.813
<i>they both knew</i>
<i>a big fight was coming.</i>

01:27.815 --> 01:30.148
<i>But when they finally</i>
<i>saw each other...</i>

01:30.150 --> 01:32.000
Pause?

01:32.002 --> 01:33.435
Pause.

01:33.437 --> 01:35.720
NARRATOR: <i>See, Lily and Marshall</i>
<i>had a long tradition</i>

01:35.722 --> 01:37.773
<i>of hitting "pause"</i>
<i>on their arguments.</i>

01:37.775 --> 01:39.674
<i>Sometimes they paused because</i>

01:39.676 --> 01:41.810
<i>they suddenly had</i>
<i>other things to do.</i>

01:41.812 --> 01:43.995
We have to stick
to our budget! Okay?

01:43.997 --> 01:45.981
You cannot be out there
buying all these

01:45.983 --> 01:47.732
Brazilian bikini waxes

01:47.734 --> 01:49.517
and Kama Sutra body oils

01:49.519 --> 01:51.169
and edible...
Pause.

01:52.405 --> 01:54.539
NARRATOR: <i>Sometimes, they paused</i>
<i>to keep their fights</i>

01:54.541 --> 01:56.158
<i>from subtly changing subjects.</i>

01:56.160 --> 01:57.692
Baby, I cannot
put up with

01:57.694 --> 01:59.828
your shoes being
all over the house!

01:59.830 --> 02:01.880
Why not? I put up with
your terrible mother.

02:01.882 --> 02:02.864
(gasps)

02:02.866 --> 02:04.332
Pause!
Pause.

02:04.334 --> 02:05.834
NARRATOR:
<i>And now that they were paused,</i>

02:05.836 --> 02:07.719
<i>Marshall realized</i>
<i>he would do anything</i>

02:07.721 --> 02:10.005
<i>to stay paused</i>
<i>for as long as he could.</i>

02:10.007 --> 02:11.706
Okay, time
to go to bed.

02:11.708 --> 02:12.841
Big day tomorrow.

02:12.843 --> 02:13.809
Big day tomorrow!
Big day tomorrow!

02:13.811 --> 02:14.893
MARSHALL:
Screw tomorrow!

02:14.895 --> 02:16.094
We go big tonight, huh?

02:16.096 --> 02:18.897
We go big tonight!
We go big tonight!

02:18.899 --> 02:20.482
(laughing)
MARSHALL: I mean, uh...

02:20.484 --> 02:21.733
come on, you know, uh,

02:21.735 --> 02:23.985
what time
is it, anyway?

02:27.439 --> 02:31.439

02:40.620 --> 02:42.570
Hey, where's
the baby?

02:44.123 --> 02:45.874
The elevator!
The elevator!

02:45.876 --> 02:47.125
(laughs)

02:47.127 --> 02:48.576
Ah, that joke just
never gets old.

02:48.578 --> 02:50.912
And it's not at all inspired
by real-life events.

02:50.914 --> 02:52.697
No, it is not.
Mm-mm.

02:52.699 --> 02:54.916
Anyway, the sitter has
Marvin for the night.

02:54.918 --> 02:56.051
Ooh!

02:56.053 --> 02:58.220
And now...
the best thing

02:58.222 --> 02:59.905
to come out of my
cross-country trip:

02:59.907 --> 03:01.723
a little segment I like to call

03:01.725 --> 03:05.527
"Embarrassing Souvenirs I Picked
Up From Ted's Childhood Home."

03:05.529 --> 03:06.761
(Robin giggles)

03:06.763 --> 03:07.863
(Barney laughs)

03:07.865 --> 03:11.183
"Totally
Awesome Ted."

03:11.185 --> 03:13.201
What, did you steal this off
some other kid named Ted?

03:13.203 --> 03:14.569
I'm just getting
warmed up here.

03:14.571 --> 03:16.037
(laughing):
This is fun.

03:16.039 --> 03:17.939
We're all...
you know, it's...

03:17.941 --> 03:19.274
I'm having fun.
(Marshall chuckles)

03:19.276 --> 03:21.877
When you squeeze this toy,
a recording of Ted says,

03:21.879 --> 03:24.129
"I wuv you, Mommy!"

03:24.131 --> 03:25.247
Oh, but
that's sweet!

03:25.249 --> 03:27.132
Why would we make
fun of him for that?

03:27.134 --> 03:28.950
He gave it to her
when he was 19.

03:28.952 --> 03:30.402
TED (recorded):
I wuv you, Mommy.

03:30.404 --> 03:32.704
(laughing)

03:32.706 --> 03:35.957
And lastly, a photo
of young Ted

03:35.959 --> 03:38.927
and his best friend
dressed up like cowboys.

03:38.929 --> 03:39.928
No, oh, all right.

03:39.930 --> 03:41.246
Leave him alone.

03:41.248 --> 03:42.731
His best friend
was a balloon.

03:42.733 --> 03:43.732
ROBIN:
I want to see that picture

03:43.734 --> 03:44.974
more than I want
to get married!

03:45.918 --> 03:47.435
(laughing)

03:47.437 --> 03:48.737
I hate you so much.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.574
(deep voice):
Oo yah maya stupa koon!

03:52.576 --> 03:54.609
Ho ho ho!

03:54.611 --> 03:56.177
NARRATOR:
<i>Over the years, we'd seen</i>

03:56.179 --> 03:58.496
<i>all sorts of levels</i>
<i>of Barney's drunkenness.</i>

03:58.498 --> 03:59.814
How you doin'?

03:59.816 --> 04:01.116
NARRATOR:
<i>"Richard Dawson drunk..."</i>

04:01.118 --> 04:02.918
Ah, is this
your sister?

04:04.153 --> 04:05.837
NARRATOR: <i>"Big plans with strangers</i>
<i>drunk..."</i>

04:05.839 --> 04:06.838
Hey!

04:06.840 --> 04:08.240
Me and the Road Dawgs

04:08.242 --> 04:11.159
going splitsies on a time share
in Flint, Michigan!

04:11.161 --> 04:13.161
And...

04:13.163 --> 04:15.330
non-refundably booked!

04:15.332 --> 04:17.933
Come on! I'm gonna buy
you all some mopeds!

04:17.935 --> 04:19.050
Road Dawgs!

04:19.052 --> 04:21.353
NARRATOR:
<i>And "Marcel Marceau drunk..."</i>

04:23.139 --> 04:25.440
<i>But we knew the night was over</i>
<i>whenever Barney got...</i>

04:25.442 --> 04:26.474
<i>"Jabba drunk."</i>

04:26.476 --> 04:28.560
<i>So drunk that his speech</i>

04:28.562 --> 04:30.362
<i>bore an uncanny</i>
<i>resemblance to that of...</i>

04:30.364 --> 04:33.648
<i>Jabba the Hutt from</i>
Return of the Jedi.

04:33.650 --> 04:34.816
Bo shuda!

04:34.818 --> 04:35.850
Ha ha ha!

04:35.852 --> 04:37.819
Okay, we have to go to bed.

04:37.821 --> 04:38.770
Big day tomorrow.

04:38.772 --> 04:39.904
Big day tomorrow!
Noon-eeg Han Solo!

04:39.906 --> 04:41.022
MARSHALL:
Screw tomorrow!

04:41.024 --> 04:42.857
Let's go big tonight!

04:42.859 --> 04:44.876
We go big tonight!
Ah wotto potto tapa ho!

04:44.878 --> 04:47.195
No, Marshall, let's go now.

04:47.913 --> 04:48.980
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

04:48.982 --> 04:50.548
Look, I-I guess we
have to do this.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.818
Okay, first off, I know how
important Italy was to you...

04:53.820 --> 04:55.887
Shut up and do me!

04:57.590 --> 05:00.008
Okay, we have
to go to bed.

05:00.010 --> 05:01.176
Yeah.

05:02.478 --> 05:04.079
Yeah.
I need to get

05:04.081 --> 05:06.147
my ear hair trimmed
in the morning.

05:06.149 --> 05:08.149
It's like a rain forest
in there.

05:08.151 --> 05:10.885
Uh, why would you volunteer
that information?

05:10.887 --> 05:12.187
Because it's the truth.

05:12.189 --> 05:15.857
Also, I peed a little
on my tie at the urinal.

05:15.859 --> 05:18.059
Uh, Barney...

05:18.061 --> 05:19.727
who's taller: me or you?

05:19.729 --> 05:21.997
You're taller.
I wear lifts in all my shoes.

05:21.999 --> 05:23.365
Oh, my God, Robin...

05:23.367 --> 05:25.684
Barney has reached
a whole new level.

05:25.686 --> 05:27.869
He's "truth serum drunk."

05:27.871 --> 05:29.387
He can't lie.

05:29.389 --> 05:31.206
So we can finally
get the answers

05:31.208 --> 05:32.874
we've always
been wondering about.

05:32.876 --> 05:34.259
Look, I know you said
you had to go to bed,

05:34.261 --> 05:35.293
but I really think...

05:35.295 --> 05:36.761
Screw tomorrow!

05:36.763 --> 05:37.896
We go big tonight.

05:37.898 --> 05:39.547
Yeah.

05:39.549 --> 05:41.866
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.

05:41.868 --> 05:43.918
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

05:43.920 --> 05:44.886
We're not unpaused?

05:44.888 --> 05:45.970
Not yet.

05:45.972 --> 05:47.305
Mama needs some Papa.

05:47.307 --> 05:48.723
But as soon as we're
done having sex,

05:48.725 --> 05:49.757
we are having that fight!

05:49.759 --> 05:51.526
Wait, so we're...

05:51.528 --> 05:53.761
not gonna fight

05:53.763 --> 05:56.731
until after we're
done having sex.

05:56.733 --> 05:58.933
Challenge accepted.

06:01.544 --> 06:02.994
Um, so... just,
just to be clear,

06:03.273 --> 06:04.873
after we finish
having sex,

06:04.875 --> 06:06.458
that's when we'll
have our fight?

06:06.460 --> 06:07.476
That's right.

06:07.478 --> 06:09.645
Excuse me.

06:15.818 --> 06:17.919
Okay, Marshall.

06:17.921 --> 06:19.254
It's go time.

06:19.256 --> 06:21.256
You've had great nights
of sex before,

06:21.258 --> 06:22.891
most of them with Lily,

06:22.893 --> 06:24.593
a few by yourself--

06:24.595 --> 06:26.345
and we'll always have that

06:26.347 --> 06:28.647
Unscrambled Spice Channel
Glitch of '93--

06:28.649 --> 06:31.350
but this has got to be
the performance of a lifetime.

06:31.352 --> 06:33.185
Jimi Hendrix at Monterey.

06:33.187 --> 06:35.404
James Brown at the Apollo.

06:35.406 --> 06:37.522
Your law school funk band
pretty much anywhere.

06:37.524 --> 06:39.358
So get out there

06:39.360 --> 06:42.778
and bang your wife for
as long as you possibly can!

06:44.914 --> 06:48.149
Not a good sign that
I'm already out of breath.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.505
So... Barney will answer

06:53.507 --> 06:56.525
any question we ask him
with the truth?

06:56.527 --> 06:57.809
I think so.

06:57.811 --> 06:59.878
Honey...

06:59.880 --> 07:03.465
when that Bryan Adams song
came on the radio,

07:03.467 --> 07:05.600
did two mosquitoes
really fly into your eyes

07:05.602 --> 07:06.635
at the same time?

07:06.637 --> 07:08.186
No.

07:08.188 --> 07:10.305
I got all choked up
thinking about how

07:10.307 --> 07:13.425
everything he does,
he does it for her.

07:13.427 --> 07:14.893
Checks out.

07:14.895 --> 07:16.027
Okay, what next?

07:16.029 --> 07:17.345
I mean, it's...

07:17.347 --> 07:18.680
it's so hard to know
where to begin.

07:18.682 --> 07:19.681
I mean, there are so many...

07:19.683 --> 07:21.182
What did you do to my mom?!

07:22.201 --> 07:23.735
BARNEY:
<i>Well, that night,</i>

07:23.737 --> 07:25.570
<i>we were in my car...</i>

07:25.572 --> 07:26.972
I was wrong!
I can't handle this!

07:26.974 --> 07:28.974
Uh, just tell me
in baseball terms.

07:28.976 --> 07:31.192
I got thrown out
trying to stretch

07:31.194 --> 07:32.527
a single into a double.

07:32.529 --> 07:33.695
(gasps)

07:36.082 --> 07:37.466
I can live with that.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.702
How about that time
you walked into the bar

07:40.704 --> 07:42.621
wearing "Triple-X-Ray Goggles"?

07:44.340 --> 07:47.041
Well, hello,
you two lovely ladies.

07:47.043 --> 07:48.226
What are you wearing?

07:48.228 --> 07:49.428
Oh, hey, Robin,
didn't see you there.

07:49.430 --> 07:52.547
Just Triple-X-Ray Goggles, no big deal.
Oh...

07:52.549 --> 07:54.766
There is no way
those things work.

07:54.768 --> 07:56.485
I'm not even here.

07:56.487 --> 07:58.353
Just act natural.

08:01.674 --> 08:02.941
Right.

08:02.943 --> 08:05.410
'Cause that jacket's

08:05.412 --> 08:07.746
Those things
didn't work, did they?

08:07.748 --> 08:10.282
Absolutely. Lily's boobs
always work for me.

08:10.284 --> 08:11.867
Oh, the goggles?
No.

08:11.869 --> 08:14.286
Next question.

08:14.288 --> 08:17.506
You keep saying "ring bear"

08:17.508 --> 08:20.074
instead of ring bear-er.

08:21.076 --> 08:23.378
Will there or will there not

08:23.380 --> 08:25.430
be a bear at our wedding?

08:25.432 --> 08:27.966
The truth is...

08:27.968 --> 08:29.751
aggle flaggle klabble.

08:29.753 --> 08:31.570
Wumby flappy snurp...

08:31.572 --> 08:33.171
Oh, my God, he's dipped back
down to Jabba drunk!

08:33.173 --> 08:34.255
Give him
another drink!

08:34.256 --> 08:36.107
Come on.

08:36.109 --> 08:38.259
Oh, yeah, baby.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.111
I could go all night.

08:40.113 --> 08:42.481
<i>I can't hold out much longer!</i>

09:25.809 --> 09:26.908
You don't seem
to be, um...

09:26.910 --> 09:30.161
Please, uh,
excuse Medium-Sized Fudge.

09:31.430 --> 09:33.982
6 and 3/64 inches.

09:33.984 --> 09:35.283
Yeah, he's back
to telling the truth.

09:35.285 --> 09:36.551
Okay, Barney,

09:36.553 --> 09:38.319
how are you always able
to do that magic trick

09:38.321 --> 09:39.955
where you make doves appear?

09:39.957 --> 09:43.174
Special dehydrated birds
I get in Chinatown.

09:46.012 --> 09:47.546
I knew it!

09:47.548 --> 09:49.831
(sighs)
Okay. Okay.

The truth is...

09:56.173 --> 09:58.473
Barney...
Oh, come on!

09:58.475 --> 09:59.941
I know that you always say

09:59.943 --> 10:01.309
that you don't
need any kind of

10:01.311 --> 10:03.695
"help" in bed,
but if you, um...

10:03.697 --> 10:05.363
I always keep
these on hand.

10:05.365 --> 10:06.815
But be
careful.

10:06.817 --> 10:09.234
When you go off, there's
a kickback like a cannon.

10:09.236 --> 10:11.119
Thank you.

10:12.855 --> 10:15.189
How much a year
do you spend on suits?

NARRATOR: <i>Kids, I won't bother you</i>
<i>with the number...</i>

10:17.911 --> 10:19.961
<i>but it was a crapload.</i>

10:19.963 --> 10:21.813
Around one crapload.

10:21.815 --> 10:23.164
That much?

10:23.166 --> 10:24.716
Well... aren't you concerned
about your future?

10:24.718 --> 10:25.867
Nope.

10:25.869 --> 10:27.836
Especially since Robin
is massively wealthy.

10:27.838 --> 10:29.271
Barney!
What?

10:29.273 --> 10:30.422
You're rich?

10:30.424 --> 10:31.573
L-Like how rich?

10:31.575 --> 10:32.841
It's my family's money,
not mine.

10:32.843 --> 10:33.892
I-I don't really know how much.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.260
How much is her family worth?

10:35.262 --> 10:36.845
6,000 craploads.

10:36.847 --> 10:38.212
Canadian craploads.

10:38.214 --> 10:39.547
That much?!

10:39.549 --> 10:40.548
But when
we dated,

10:40.550 --> 10:41.883
I paid for everything.

10:41.885 --> 10:43.501
You didn't pay for everything.

10:43.503 --> 10:44.486
He paid for everything.

10:44.488 --> 10:46.371
I pick up our bar tab
all the time.

10:46.373 --> 10:48.023
Three times
in the last nine years.

10:48.025 --> 10:50.191
I took you out to tons
of four-star restaurants.

10:50.193 --> 10:51.276
Two-star restaurants.

10:51.278 --> 10:53.061
Figuring, on average,
two meals out a week

10:53.063 --> 10:54.562
plus 20% tip...

10:54.564 --> 10:55.780
12 and a half percent tip.

10:55.782 --> 10:58.083
Do you know
how much money you cost me?

10:58.085 --> 10:59.434
What am I?
A prostitute?

10:59.436 --> 11:00.919
You are not a prostitute.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.004
No, a prostitute
would've been cheaper.

11:03.006 --> 11:04.990
Depends on the prostitute.

11:04.992 --> 11:07.158
Wait, hold on, Ted
What are we doing?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.576
You're arguing
about Robin's wealth

11:08.578 --> 11:11.046
when you really should be asking
me embarrassing questions.

11:11.048 --> 11:12.597
He's right.

11:12.599 --> 11:13.515
Let's do this.

11:13.517 --> 11:14.966
NARRATOR:
<i>And so we did it.</i>

11:14.968 --> 11:16.668
<i>We asked Barney</i>
<i>all the questions</i>

11:16.670 --> 11:17.652
<i>we'd always wanted to.</i>

11:17.654 --> 11:20.355
In one night? Four.

11:20.357 --> 11:22.991
In one family? Three.

11:22.993 --> 11:26.361
Yes, but not while she
was secretary of state.

11:26.363 --> 11:29.981
Yes, but not while <i>she</i> was
secretary of state.

11:29.983 --> 11:31.399
Just once.

11:31.401 --> 11:34.435
With a French male model Henri.

11:34.437 --> 11:35.704
It was late.

11:35.706 --> 11:37.622
We were the last two people
in the club.

11:37.624 --> 11:40.075
I was lonely and I figured,
why not try it?

11:41.377 --> 11:44.145
That was the only time
I ever split a cab.

11:44.147 --> 11:46.998
Yes, but not the M.I.T.
you're thinking of.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.884
The Magician's Institute
of Teaneck.

11:49.886 --> 11:53.588
I've had sex
in Ted's bed 14 times.

11:53.590 --> 11:57.125
I asked if you wear
shoulder pads.

11:57.127 --> 11:59.644
I think I've just got
one question left.

11:59.646 --> 12:01.212
And it's a biggie.

12:02.064 --> 12:04.315
Barney Stinson...

12:04.317 --> 12:06.568
...what do you do for a living?

12:09.388 --> 12:10.505
You did it.

12:10.507 --> 12:13.307
You banged your wife to sleep.

12:13.309 --> 12:15.493
Nice job...

NARRATOR: <i>Kids, in all the time</i>
<i>we knew Barney,</i>

12:31.607 --> 12:34.658

Seriously, what is it
that you do?

12:36.395 --> 12:37.778
(chuckles) Please.

12:37.780 --> 12:38.745
Okay, seriously.

12:38.747 --> 12:40.414
What do you do for a living?

12:40.416 --> 12:42.049
(chuckles) Please.

12:42.051 --> 12:44.284
Are you finally gonna tell me
exactly what your job is?

12:44.286 --> 12:45.953
(chuckles) Please.

12:45.955 --> 12:48.772

12:48.774 --> 12:52.742
Well, what do you do

12:56.247 --> 12:58.081
Please.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.349
(groans)
God, he's not telling us.

12:59.351 --> 13:00.350
More booze.

13:00.352 --> 13:02.803
Not so fast, princess.

13:02.805 --> 13:04.638
I guess subtle clues
and the bar tab

13:04.640 --> 13:06.607
are two things
you just don't pick up.

13:06.609 --> 13:07.757
Because...

13:07.759 --> 13:10.227
I think he is telling us.

13:10.229 --> 13:12.529
Tell us more about this job.

BARNEY:
<i>Well, as you know,</i>

13:14.683 --> 13:16.283

13:16.285 --> 13:18.235
<i>a business man came</i>
<i>into my coffee shop,</i>

13:18.237 --> 13:20.070
<i>told me money was</i>
<i>all that mattered,</i>

13:20.072 --> 13:21.488
<i>and stole my girlfriend.</i>

13:21.490 --> 13:25.108
<i>That's when I decided</i>
<i>to become awesome.</i>

13:25.110 --> 13:28.645
<i>But I had no idea how to break</i>
<i>into the corporate world.</i>

13:28.647 --> 13:30.047
<i>So, hoping he wouldn't</i>
<i>recognize me,</i>

13:30.049 --> 13:31.781
<i>I went to the one person</i>
<i>from whom</i>

13:31.783 --> 13:34.384
<i>I knew I could learn</i>
<i>everything.</i>

13:34.386 --> 13:35.802
Do we know each other, bro?

13:35.804 --> 13:39.473
We're all connected
in Gaia's great tapestry of...

13:39.475 --> 13:41.558
(clears throat)
No.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.893
We don't.

13:42.895 --> 13:44.728
Bro.

13:46.014 --> 13:47.347
Wow, you went to M.I.T.

13:47.349 --> 13:48.515
Pretty impressive.

13:48.517 --> 13:51.401
I did get a perfect score
on the A.C.T.'s.

13:51.403 --> 13:54.404
Advanced Card Tricks.

13:54.406 --> 13:55.606
Well, look, buddy.

13:55.608 --> 13:57.107
You got a sweet résumé.

13:57.109 --> 13:59.192
But we don't have any openings
you're qualified for.

13:59.194 --> 14:01.862
They set me up!
It was a trap! It's a trap!

14:03.814 --> 14:06.466
We have one opening
you'd be perfect for.

14:06.468 --> 14:08.535
Great. What do I do?

14:08.537 --> 14:10.621
Please.

14:10.623 --> 14:13.040
"Provide Legal Exculpation
And Sign Everything."

14:13.042 --> 14:14.257
Just show up every day,

14:14.259 --> 14:15.976
scribble your name on
a bunch of documents,

14:15.978 --> 14:18.011
and we'll pay you
16 craploads a year.

14:19.163 --> 14:20.297
Deets are in the contract.

14:20.299 --> 14:21.739
I'll give you time
to think about it.

14:23.301 --> 14:24.718
I'll take it.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.769
Hold on.

14:25.771 --> 14:27.421
Did you even read this
before signing it?

14:27.423 --> 14:28.388
No.

14:28.390 --> 14:29.723
(laughs)
You're hired.

14:32.310 --> 14:33.276
We'll work on that.

14:33.278 --> 14:34.645
TED:
<i>Wait.</i>

14:34.647 --> 14:35.646
That's your job?

14:35.648 --> 14:37.864
You sign sketchy,
legally binding documents

14:37.866 --> 14:40.017
that could implicate you
for God knows what?

14:40.019 --> 14:42.169
Best job ever, right?

14:43.388 --> 14:45.455
No more pausing.

14:45.457 --> 14:47.157
We're getting
through this argument.

14:47.159 --> 14:49.042
Okay.

14:49.044 --> 14:51.011
No potshots at my mom.

14:51.013 --> 14:52.796
Fine, no distracting me
with your calves.

14:52.798 --> 14:54.998
Fine.

14:58.603 --> 15:01.054
Look, I love you, Lilypad.

15:01.056 --> 15:02.723
I love you, Marshmallow.

15:02.725 --> 15:04.641
(deep breath)
Now...

15:04.643 --> 15:06.309
(exhales)

15:06.311 --> 15:09.613
...how could you take
that job without telling me?!

15:09.615 --> 15:12.564
Baby, I'm sorry, but they needed
an answer right away.

15:12.565 --> 15:13.681
This is a huge opportunity,

15:13.683 --> 15:15.400
it could be very good
for our family,

15:15.402 --> 15:17.352
and we have to
at least talk about it.

15:17.354 --> 15:20.104
Sorry, you lost your chance
to talk about it

15:20.106 --> 15:22.156
when you didn't talk about it.

15:22.891 --> 15:24.475
We're going to Italy.

15:24.477 --> 15:25.943
But I could be a judge.

15:25.945 --> 15:29.080
We can't give that up for
what is clearly just a hobby.

15:29.082 --> 15:30.248
Pause.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.499
No pause.

15:31.501 --> 15:33.484
That "hobby" is my dream.

15:33.486 --> 15:35.169
We're going to Italy.

15:35.171 --> 15:36.254
But it's my dream to...

15:36.256 --> 15:37.505
We are going to Italy!

15:37.507 --> 15:38.873
Baby, can you just...?

15:38.875 --> 15:40.508
We are going to Italy!

15:40.510 --> 15:41.709
Don't you get it?

15:41.711 --> 15:43.878
You went behind my back.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.596
You hurt me.

15:45.598 --> 15:49.567
You were more selfish
than I have ever been to you.

15:49.569 --> 15:54.472
You broke up with me
and moved to San Francisco.

15:55.607 --> 15:57.392
Barney!
You're being stupid.

15:57.394 --> 15:59.894
The-the-the company is
setting you up as their fall guy

15:59.896 --> 16:02.480
for all of their
illegal activities.

16:02.482 --> 16:05.316
No, you guys are being stupid.

16:05.318 --> 16:06.868
Especially Ted.

16:06.870 --> 16:08.453
What? I didn't say anything.

16:08.455 --> 16:12.240
NARRATOR: <i>And then, kids, Barney revealed</i>
<i>to us his master plan.</i>

16:12.242 --> 16:14.776

16:14.778 --> 16:16.694
Hey, Greg?

16:16.696 --> 16:18.046
I know you're busy,

16:18.048 --> 16:20.114
but FYI, I've been colluding
with the Feds.

16:20.116 --> 16:21.382
They know everything.

16:21.384 --> 16:22.917
And they're
on their way up right now

16:22.919 --> 16:24.552
to shut down this division
and arrest you.

16:24.554 --> 16:25.887
Door closed or...?

16:25.889 --> 16:27.221
What?

16:27.223 --> 16:28.589
Why would you do that?

16:28.591 --> 16:31.225
Oh, gosh,
countless moral reasons...

16:31.227 --> 16:32.643
could have applied,

16:32.645 --> 16:36.431
but this is pretty much revenge
for stealing my girlfriend.

16:36.433 --> 16:38.048
<i>See? That day, I vowed</i>

16:38.050 --> 16:40.551
<i>I would do everything</i>

16:47.360 --> 16:49.026
Just a guy who served you

16:49.028 --> 16:50.561
coffee once.

16:50.563 --> 16:51.846
Peace out, loser.

16:51.848 --> 16:53.698
♪ Barney Stinson,
Barney Stinson ♪

16:53.700 --> 16:55.333
You son of a bitch!
♪ That guy's awesome ♪

16:55.335 --> 16:58.068
I will destroy you!
Get your hands off of me.

16:58.070 --> 17:01.189
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

17:01.191 --> 17:03.541
♪ Awesome.

17:03.543 --> 17:05.009
Why are you

17:05.011 --> 17:06.594
bringing up San Francisco?

17:06.596 --> 17:08.628
That was seven years ago.

17:08.631 --> 17:10.580
Because you are being

17:10.583 --> 17:12.967
selfish all over again.

17:12.969 --> 17:14.852
Marshall, I apologized

17:14.854 --> 17:17.421
over and over again.

17:17.423 --> 17:20.141
Now you're saying you
never have forgiven me?

17:20.143 --> 17:21.275
There is

17:21.277 --> 17:24.194
nothing more important to me
than our family.

17:24.196 --> 17:25.445
You know that.

17:25.448 --> 17:26.696
Well, let me ask.

17:26.699 --> 17:29.233
What if you had found
success in San Francisco?

17:29.968 --> 17:31.452
How do I know that you even

17:31.454 --> 17:32.670
would've come back to me?

17:32.672 --> 17:34.438
Stop it.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.907
Are Marvin and I

17:35.909 --> 17:38.543
and any other future children
we may have

17:38.545 --> 17:41.129
just some consolation prize?

17:41.131 --> 17:43.297
I have to get out of here.

17:45.617 --> 17:46.584
Babe?

17:46.586 --> 17:48.886
(door slams)

17:48.888 --> 17:50.087
So, Barney,

17:50.089 --> 17:51.589
I still haven't
heard you pronounce

17:51.591 --> 17:53.007
that last syllable.

17:53.809 --> 17:57.228
At our wedding, will there be

17:57.230 --> 17:59.680
a ring bear-er?

17:59.682 --> 18:01.182
(deep breath)

18:01.184 --> 18:02.934
The truth is...

18:03.836 --> 18:06.838
...yes, there will be
a ring bear-er.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.823
His name is Trevor Hudson,

18:08.825 --> 18:10.958
I worked with his mother,
and he's adorable.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.778
I want our wedding
to be perfect, Robin.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.613
Me, too.

18:16.582 --> 18:17.648
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.

18:17.650 --> 18:18.783
He's okay to crash
with you, right?

18:18.785 --> 18:20.868
Yup, we'll see you
in the morning.

18:20.870 --> 18:22.537
Hmm.

18:22.539 --> 18:23.704
I love you.

18:23.706 --> 18:25.506
I love you, too.

18:29.428 --> 18:32.296
Okay, I got one last question
for you.

18:32.298 --> 18:34.398
And I can't believe
I haven't asked it yet.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.034
Dude, you're getting
married tomorrow.

18:38.203 --> 18:40.171
How are you doing?
Good.

18:40.173 --> 18:42.773
I mean, I'm a little nervous,

18:42.775 --> 18:46.510
but I love Robin more
than I've ever loved anyone,

18:46.512 --> 18:49.130
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to make her happy.

18:49.132 --> 18:50.648
For a long time,

18:50.650 --> 18:52.850
deep down,

18:52.852 --> 18:55.019
I've felt sort of...

18:55.021 --> 18:57.788
broken?

18:57.790 --> 19:00.241
I don't feel that way anymore.

19:00.243 --> 19:02.526
Robin, along with the idea

19:02.528 --> 19:05.296
that vengeance
will soon be mine,

19:05.298 --> 19:09.133
has made me 100% awesome.

19:09.135 --> 19:10.401
I'm proud of you, buddy.

19:10.403 --> 19:13.387
Globan froban.

19:13.389 --> 19:14.472
Ho, ho, ho.

19:14.474 --> 19:15.473
Okay.

19:15.475 --> 19:16.724
Come on, Jabba.

19:16.726 --> 19:17.675
Big day tomorrow.

19:17.677 --> 19:19.844
(grunts)
Tab for the night?

19:19.846 --> 19:21.378
Just so you know,

19:21.380 --> 19:24.899
those last few rounds of 35-year
Glen McKenna were not cheap.

19:24.901 --> 19:25.983
Whoa.

19:25.985 --> 19:27.051
Um...

19:27.053 --> 19:28.402
you know what?

19:28.404 --> 19:29.687
Charge them to the bride's room.

19:29.689 --> 19:30.855
Thank you.

19:30.857 --> 19:31.889
Come on.
(muttering)

19:31.891 --> 19:33.824
Let's go. We got you.

19:38.932 --> 19:42.066
Hi. I-I know it's late,
but I've got to get out of here.

19:42.068 --> 19:45.086
Marshall and I
just had a huge fight.

19:45.088 --> 19:47.371
You will?

19:47.373 --> 19:50.124
Oh, my God, thank you.

You good, yeah?
Yeah.

20:06.142 --> 20:08.559
Okay.

20:08.561 --> 20:09.593
Okay.

20:09.595 --> 20:10.695
Everything is fine.

20:10.697 --> 20:11.779
Okay? Just don't freak out.

20:11.781 --> 20:12.763
I'm not freaking out.

20:12.765 --> 20:13.781
I was talking to myself.

20:13.783 --> 20:15.316
Do you have the baby?

20:15.318 --> 20:16.667
The elevator!
What?!

20:16.669 --> 20:18.402
Marshall and Lily are right.
It never gets old.

20:18.404 --> 20:19.870
Unless you're crowning.

20:19.872 --> 20:21.706
So proud of you.
Thank you.

20:21.708 --> 20:23.374
Penny is proud of you.

20:23.376 --> 20:24.992
Let's go get you a brother.

20:24.994 --> 20:26.594
Okay?
Hmm?

20:26.596 --> 20:27.662
You want a brother?
All right?

20:27.664 --> 20:29.947
I love you.
I love you, too.

20:29.949 --> 20:31.115
You're gonna be great.

20:31.117 --> 20:32.266
Yeah, okay.
