anything you needed

00:04.212 --> 00:06.088
before l went on
my maternity leave.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.257

Great. Well,

00:11.428 --> 00:12.511
Wait a minute.
Okay, thanks.

00:12.595 --> 00:16.432
You can't do that.
You cannot exploit
your baby for sales.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.475
Hey, did l tell you
we're gonna have a baby?

00:18.560 --> 00:21.395

Thank you very much.
l'm excited. . . Oh.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.106
Definitely.
No. No!

You need to come by
your sales honorably.

There is nothing
dishonorable about
talking about your life.

Listen, uh,
would you be interested
in restocking on paper?

00:37.954 --> 00:39.371
Yeah, l could sure
use the money.

00:39.456 --> 00:43.292
My cousin came down with
a case of that nasty
new goat fungus.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.836
Oh, it's just horrific.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.797

he's never seen it
beard so quickly.

Okay.

00:53.845 --> 00:57.473

l'll never outsell
Jim and Pam without one.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.310
Also, l've been noticing
a gaping hole in my life.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.980
Sometimes l wake up
cradling a gourd.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.045
Kevin, you're
such a gourmand.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.090
l cooked my way through
Julia Child's cookbook,

01:31.174 --> 01:33.926

The TwiIight Cookbook.

01:34.010 --> 01:37.012

l had Edward's
cornflake chicken.

KEVIN: Pregnant Pam and I,
we get hungry
at the same times,

01:42.060 --> 01:45.354
so we've been
eating together a lot.
Not all meals.

01:45.605 --> 01:50.734
Just second breakfast,
lunch, second lunch
and first dinner.

01:51.194 --> 01:55.405
l thought that maybe
we should do something
special for early dinner.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.867
One last ultra feast.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.829
Mmm. That sounds great.

a surprise.

Getting there, huh?

No, no. l still have time.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.964
l'm having contractions,
but they're irregular
and far apart.

So l'm not really in labor,
l'm near labor.

PAM: If we check in
after midnight,

I get an
extra day to recuperate
surrounded by doctors.

the extra night's sleep

02:23.059 --> 02:24.393
in the hospital
will be very nice,

02:24.477 --> 02:26.395
because once we
bring the baby home,

02:26.479 --> 02:29.523
if it's crying all night,
one of us is gonna have to
take care of it,

02:29.607 --> 02:32.484
and l do not
plan on helping
unless it's a boy.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.112

that joke to be over.

Michael, you shouldn't
have done that.

gonna live here, right?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.511

was conceived here,

here a little bit, too.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.908
Because the insurance company
only covers two nights.

Everything's fine.
We have plenty of time.

speaking as a former baby.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.167
Don't get too hung
up on baby names.

05:35.251 --> 05:39.087
l was named Walter Junior
after my father,

05:39.422 --> 05:42.674
until l was about six
or so, when my parents
changed their minds.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.177
l thought you said
your younger brother
was named Walter Junior.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.304
My brother was born

05:47.388 --> 05:50.599
and my parents felt
he better exemplified
the Walter Junior name,

05:50.683 --> 05:53.393
so they gave it to him.
l was given Andrew,

05:53.478 --> 05:55.687

of a baby-name book.

crowded in here.

to her body's signals.

Yes.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.919
Why was l hiding
behind the plant?

30:39.003 --> 30:41.296
Well, in college
l took a botany class,

30:41.381 --> 30:44.341
and there was lots of
drama in that class.
Uh. . .

30:44.425 --> 30:47.970

so l would eavesdrop on them

30:48.346 --> 30:51.765
by hiding behind
different plants
in the botany class.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.685
And then they
would say things like,

30:54.769 --> 30:56.353
"Oh, this guy's gonna
fail this class,"

or, "What's this
guy doing spying on us
from behind plants?"

31:00.608 --> 31:02.192
And then l would
jump out at them

31:02.277 --> 31:04.528
and confront them
and be like,

31:04.612 --> 31:08.907
"You think all l do
is hide behind plants and
spy on people? Busted."

31:09.576 --> 31:11.451
Oh. The reason?

31:11.911 --> 31:13.954
The reason l was
hiding behind that plant
in this situation

31:14.038 --> 31:18.041
was that l thought
that Erin and Kevin
were kind of hitting it off,

31:18.126 --> 31:19.918

of your move.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.004
(LAUGHS)

41:06.088 --> 41:07.881
MlCHAEL: There is no
greater feeling

41:09.049 --> 41:11.134

who are perfect
for each other

41:11.218 --> 41:14.137
overcome all obstacles
and find true love.

41:14.889 --> 41:19.225
