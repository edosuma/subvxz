WEBVTT

00:09.100 --> 00:12.333
So I walked into Rob
with Blac Chyna at my house.

00:12.333 --> 00:15.333
- Excuse me?
- Having Chyna over at

00:15.333 --> 00:19.033
my house without my knowledge is
disrespectful, because Chyna's

00:19.033 --> 00:22.900
Tyga's ex-girlfriend, and I just
don't want that drama in my

00:22.900 --> 00:25.433
personal space.
I told him, I said, "You've

00:25.433 --> 00:28.300
burned your last bridge."
Really, what a

00:28.300 --> 00:32.100
- nightmare.
- By the way, Rob's out

00:32.100 --> 00:36.967
of my house.
Robert has moved in with, I

00:36.967 --> 00:39.200
guess, his girlfriend, Blac
Chyna.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.100
He's trying to buy the
house right next door to her.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.767
You better not be
paying for his down payment.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.800
- He doesn't deserve it.
- We have to be a little

00:46.800 --> 00:49.067
- more understanding.
- No, we just have to stop

00:49.067 --> 01:00.500
- babying him and step back.
- Cut the cord.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.733
I want to get in
there.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.900
Okay, climb up into
the cart.

01:04.900 --> 01:08.367
I cannot even get in
this...

01:11.900 --> 01:14.567
Let's find some
stuff, okay?

01:14.567 --> 01:16.167
I want to go on that
side.

01:16.167 --> 01:19.200
Ooh, natural gum?
How exciting.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.600
- Can I taste?
- Yeah.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.467
Yo, yo.
What up, my main man?

01:23.467 --> 01:25.767
- I'm trying gum!
- We just found

01:25.767 --> 01:28.267
- natural gum.
- Natural gum?

01:28.267 --> 01:31.133
- Okay, let's try it.
- Yeah.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.233
- How is it?
- Um, good.

01:33.233 --> 01:34.933
- You like it, Mase man?
Mm-hmm.

01:34.933 --> 01:36.633
You like it enough
that you want to purchase it?

01:36.633 --> 01:41.533
Okay.
Got cinnamon, also.

01:41.533 --> 01:43.267
- Yum! Yummy!
- Kourt, what about

01:43.267 --> 01:44.500
- these?
- No, they're not

01:44.500 --> 01:45.933
- organic.
- Oh, man!

01:45.933 --> 01:48.167
- Look, looky, looky!
- They're organic,

01:48.167 --> 01:50.333
- but they're not vegan.
- Damn.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.100
Those are not
organic, unfortunately.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.067
I knew you were gonna
say that.

01:54.067 --> 01:56.333
I don't know how long
I could shop like this, but...

01:56.333 --> 01:59.333
...it-it seems all right.

02:23.067 --> 02:25.667
- Are those mine?
- Yeah.

02:25.667 --> 02:30.633
You're putting my
icing stuff on your?

02:30.633 --> 02:32.867
I need more.

02:32.867 --> 02:36.467
'Cause they're, like, exploding.
I need them to calm down.

02:36.467 --> 02:39.967
That's not very
sanitary.

02:39.967 --> 02:43.667
Question-- like, don't we kind
of think it's a miracle that

02:43.667 --> 02:46.700
Rob, who doesn't even show up to
Christmas for the past three

02:46.700 --> 02:49.600
years, literally.
He wouldn't leave his room.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.733
But the fact that now he's
created a Snapchat... the fact

02:52.733 --> 02:55.800
that now he wants to be so
public blows my mind.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.267
She gave him confidence.
More power to her.

03:00.267 --> 03:04.133
After Rob and Blac Chyna started
dating, Rob is now, like, all

03:04.133 --> 03:07.467
over social media and, like, out
and about.

03:07.467 --> 03:11.100
Like, he hasn't been like this
in so long that even though

03:11.100 --> 03:14.333
there's been some drama, if this
is what it takes, then I don't

03:14.333 --> 03:18.100
care who he's dating.
I'm so happy that he's just, you

03:18.100 --> 03:21.567
know, feeling better about
himself.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.767
If some  is
getting him to remove his braces

03:24.767 --> 03:26.767
and shave his beard and work
out...

03:26.767 --> 03:29.100
My thing is, do what
you want, do what makes you

03:29.100 --> 03:33.133
happy, whatever.
But he should have said to us,

03:33.133 --> 03:37.133
"Hey, guys, this is how I feel.
I can't help who I love and I

03:37.133 --> 03:41.367
fell in love with her, but Kylie
should know this."

03:41.367 --> 03:44.667
- He just has no loyalty.
- He has no loyalty.

03:44.667 --> 03:50.433
Chyna is Tyga's ex, and Kylie's
dating Tyga now, so it's pretty

03:50.433 --> 03:53.700
complicated, but am I happy he's
out and about?

03:53.700 --> 03:56.200
For sure.
Am I disappointed that Rob isn't

03:56.200 --> 03:58.933
talking to me, after he got out
of my house?

03:58.933 --> 04:01.267
Yeah.
'Cause I've been the only one

04:01.267 --> 04:05.033
that stood by him and defended
him and wanted the best for him.

04:05.033 --> 04:07.800
So that's just where it gets
frustrating.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.967
Oh.
You just... you just riled me

04:09.967 --> 04:13.033
- up!
- Yeah.

04:13.033 --> 04:16.733
Flips hair Kimoji!
Where is it when you need it?

04:24.767 --> 04:28.033
Okay, kids.
I've been hit in the face, I've

04:28.033 --> 04:30.700
been...
Your kids are like little

04:30.700 --> 04:33.967
animals, right, Mason?
How old are you?

04:33.967 --> 04:37.667
- Stop getting older!
- What's up, big man?

04:37.667 --> 04:41.333
You're coming to me.
You're coming to me, man.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.867
What are you doing?

04:43.867 --> 04:48.800
He's smart!

04:48.800 --> 04:50.533
Mase, we're gonna
eat.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.767
We're gonna eat.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.800
What happened, Reign?
She stopped me.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.367
Corey is my mom's
boyfriend, and they've been

04:57.367 --> 04:59.833
- together for a while now.
- Who wants

04:59.833 --> 05:03.333
- gluten-free, dairy-free pizza?
- You should get, like,

05:03.333 --> 05:06.667
the-the damn Green Award for,
like, the healthiest house or

05:06.667 --> 05:08.600
- something.
- I should.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.967
I think it's kind of
funny that Corey's so close to

05:10.967 --> 05:12.867
Kourtney.
I don't know, like...

05:12.867 --> 05:15.300
It's a little weird, but...
it's... you know, he's the

05:15.300 --> 05:19.100
- nicest.
- Want some pizza?

05:19.100 --> 05:22.400
- It's yucky!
- What?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.233
- It's nasty.
- Mom, I don't like the

05:25.233 --> 05:28.567
- pizza.
- Come on, Mase, cheer

05:28.567 --> 05:30.467
- up.
- No.

05:30.467 --> 05:32.633
You like it?
It's so good, right?

05:32.633 --> 05:35.000
- No.
- Want some rice?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.300
- Reign, is it good?
- Uh!

05:37.300 --> 05:39.667
This is not giving gluten-free a
good name.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.733
Where you going?
Where you going?

05:41.733 --> 05:43.567
Where you going?

05:43.567 --> 05:45.367
This was a fun
dinner!

05:45.367 --> 05:48.200
What more could you ask for?

05:56.267 --> 05:59.000
- Where am I gonna be?
- You're gonna be kind

05:59.000 --> 06:01.367
- of, like, gorgeously here...
- Yes.

06:01.367 --> 06:02.900
...in your little,
kind of, you know...

06:02.900 --> 06:04.667
- Yeah.
- ... off pumps,

06:04.667 --> 06:07.100
looking super sexy, but kind of,
like, you know, you're ready for

06:07.100 --> 06:09.200
- business.
-  off pumps.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.967
I love it.

06:10.967 --> 06:12.867
I love some  off pumps.

06:14.867 --> 06:18.567
I have been asked to shoot the
Architectural Digest,

06:18.567 --> 06:21.433
and it is such a dream come
true.

06:21.433 --> 06:23.533
I mean, it's my favorite
magazine.

06:23.533 --> 06:26.200
This is, like, literally a
dream.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.900
I'm so... it's like I can't even
believe this day is happening

06:29.900 --> 06:32.567
and that it's real.
And I'm so excited.

06:32.567 --> 06:34.033
Oh, God, well,
we're thrilled to be here right

06:34.033 --> 06:35.533
- now.
She-she's asked me if

06:35.533 --> 06:37.000
we thought this ever would
happen for about the last year

06:37.000 --> 06:38.500
- and a half.
- So do you think we

06:38.500 --> 06:40.000
could ever...
Like, I've been reading this

06:40.000 --> 06:43.233
magazine since... I can't even
remember.

06:43.233 --> 06:46.133
- So I'm super excited.
- Well, we're

06:46.133 --> 06:49.133
excited.
Beautiful!

06:49.133 --> 06:51.867
Here we go. Lovely.
Have you done this before?

06:51.867 --> 06:54.400
That's good.
Nice, love!

06:54.400 --> 06:55.967
Too bad I don't
work in this office.

06:55.967 --> 06:58.600
Beauty, gnarly,

06:58.600 --> 07:00.567
- gorgeous.
- I've been working

07:00.567 --> 07:05.200
on my house for the last two
years, hoping that it would be

07:05.200 --> 07:07.333
Architectural
Digest.

07:07.333 --> 07:12.167
I'm obsessed with interior
design and so I'm just so happy.

07:12.167 --> 07:16.833
This is like a dream come true.
So I guess we're shooting this

07:16.833 --> 07:20.633
other cover at Khloe's now.
This is, like, my thing...

07:20.633 --> 07:22.833
Mm-hmm.
- ...and she doesn't

07:22.833 --> 07:27.300
really care as much about
interiors as I do, 'cause I'm,

07:27.300 --> 07:29.400
- like, obsessed.
Mm-hmm.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.667
I'm, like, so
excited.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.133
- This is, like...
- You've wanted

07:33.133 --> 07:34.800
- this forever.
- ...literally a

07:34.800 --> 07:37.333
dream come true.

07:42.133 --> 07:44.433
Beautiful, that's
lovely.

07:44.433 --> 07:47.367
It was nice when you had your
hands together around, too.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.600
- That's lovely, beautiful.
- The fact that I'm

07:50.600 --> 07:53.033
sharing this with Khloe is just
crazy.

07:53.033 --> 07:56.433
We're the first siblings to be
Architectural Digest

07:56.433 --> 08:00.067
cover, so it's just such an
amazing day.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.567
All right, we're ready to rock
and roll.

08:02.567 --> 08:05.133
Let's shoot this.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.567
- Mason, smile.
- Gorgeous!

08:07.567 --> 08:11.800
Oh, you look great!
Lovely, that's fantastic!

08:11.800 --> 08:13.500
Look over at Kourtney for me,
Mason.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.533
- Mase, look at Mom.
- Yes!

08:15.533 --> 08:17.600
Lovely, that's good!

08:24.367 --> 08:26.500
Was one of these
salads for you?

08:26.500 --> 08:29.367
Yeah, but I don't want
it.

08:29.367 --> 08:32.167
I think we're gonna get this big
Rick Owens bed.

08:32.167 --> 08:35.000
Like, have you seen the one
that's, like... goes up, like,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.667
- really high?
Hmm-mm.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.567
And it has, like, a
border around.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.567
- It's really cool; you'd like it.
- Is it wood?

08:41.567 --> 08:43.600
They had it in marble,
but we're gonna have to make it

08:43.600 --> 08:45.567
- in, like, wood or something.
- Yeah, you don't

08:45.567 --> 08:47.433
- want a marble bed.
- No, it's, like, way too

08:47.433 --> 08:49.100
hard.
You can only have that if

08:49.100 --> 08:51.267
- you're, like...
- Never.

08:51.267 --> 08:53.533
- ...single and, like...
- Not even.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.300
Someone could bang their head on
it, if you're hooking up.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.500
Yeah.
The marble looks so...

08:58.500 --> 09:00.333
- And die.
- Yeah.

09:00.333 --> 09:04.133
- So it's just not, like, comfy.
- So, did you hear

09:04.133 --> 09:08.033
- that, uh, Rob bought a house?
- Yeah, so what is the

09:08.033 --> 09:10.067
deal?
Like, Khloe doesn't know?

09:10.067 --> 09:12.667
- I guess not, but...
- She's gonna, like, freak

09:12.667 --> 09:14.667
that he has, like, his own
house, like, right down the

09:14.667 --> 09:16.667
- street.
- Yeah, but I think

09:16.667 --> 09:18.667
- she'll be...
- It's so good for him.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.667
I think also, it's
like, it wasn't working out with

09:20.667 --> 09:22.833
- him being there, so...
- Yeah.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.267
But she's
definitely gonna freak out.

09:25.267 --> 09:27.500
Yeah, but I think it's
so good that he's, like, you

09:27.500 --> 09:29.767
know, on his own.
He's, like, saved his money.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.833
And he's, like, doing his own
thing.

09:31.833 --> 09:35.333
I mean, there's
just been a lot of drama.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.600
I feel like Mom needs to
tell Khloe.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.733
I feel like Rob
should tell her, but have they

09:39.733 --> 09:42.400
- even spoken?
- I don't know.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.533
I think Khloe and Rob always had
a really special bond.

09:44.533 --> 09:46.533
Are you going to
school today?

09:46.533 --> 09:48.533
- Yes!
- You are?

09:48.533 --> 09:50.633
- No, he's not.
- Like, they were really

09:50.633 --> 09:53.200
close in age, and they were
BFFs.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.100
The point of the matter
is I miss you.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.800
You make everything
feel like we're back at home.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.367
- I'm happy.
- You're happy, good.

10:04.367 --> 10:06.367
They lived together.
They have such a history

10:06.367 --> 10:09.200
together.
So I think Khloe's just extra

10:09.200 --> 10:13.200
hurt that he still hasn't called
her since he moved out.

10:13.200 --> 10:20.967
So I understand it and I really
do feel bad for her.

10:20.967 --> 10:24.833
Do you find it bizarre that
Kourtney and Corey...

10:24.833 --> 10:26.833
- Are BFF?
- ...are BFF?

10:26.833 --> 10:28.833
Did you see that hike
they went on and they're, like,

10:28.833 --> 10:30.833
- posing together?
- Yes!

10:30.833 --> 10:33.233
That was the nail in
the coffin for me.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.533
So, Robert-- he's
getting a house.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.767
He's very excited.
And I want you to be supportive

10:38.767 --> 10:40.733
- and get on board.
- I don't even talk to

10:40.733 --> 10:42.633
Rob.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.800
- So tired already.
- Cancel, cancel.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.833
No, I don't want to
go.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.833
How do we get Kourtney...?
Are you going out?

10:59.833 --> 11:02.033
- Can you go with Kourtney?
- God...

11:02.033 --> 11:04.067
- Jen will go with Corey.
- Jen, is your husband

11:04.067 --> 11:06.333
- in town?
- No, so Jen's gonna

11:06.333 --> 11:08.667
- come with us, Khlo!
- No, he's gone.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.933
She might be going
just with you.

11:10.933 --> 11:13.333
- Why?
- I'm just, this seems

11:13.333 --> 11:15.867
- like such a bore!
- It's gonna be fun.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.867
You just need to get, like, into
it.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.933
But I feel like we
could, like, I'm having such a

11:19.933 --> 11:23.300
- nice time in glam so far.
- Well, it gets better.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.600
- I can tell you that much.
- We have jobs in the

11:25.600 --> 11:27.167
morning.
How is everyone going to work

11:27.167 --> 11:29.600
tomorrow?
I'm not as young as I once used

11:29.600 --> 11:32.000
- to be.
- Khloe, you only

11:32.000 --> 11:35.767
- live once.
- Yep, she's right.

11:35.767 --> 11:38.467
- It's 9:00, you guys.
- What, are you

11:38.467 --> 11:41.467
- saying it's early or late?
- It's super early.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.700
- Let's call Corey.
- I don't know Corey

11:43.700 --> 11:45.700
like that.
Like, we're just gonna FaceTime

11:45.700 --> 11:47.900
- Corey?
- Yeah, I FaceTime

11:47.900 --> 11:51.767
- him literally every day.
- I love Corey.

11:51.767 --> 11:54.533
I think he's super nice.
And I love how happy my mom is.

11:54.533 --> 11:57.100
But still, I'm not, like,
hanging out with Corey

11:57.100 --> 11:59.633
one-on-one all the time, because
I, like, am respecting

11:59.633 --> 12:02.800
everyone's space.
Like, Kourtney and Corey are

12:02.800 --> 12:07.167
- like... conjoined twins.
- Where is he, honey?

12:07.167 --> 12:09.533
- I know.
- Where's your little

12:09.533 --> 12:11.667
- bitch at?
- Yeah!

12:11.667 --> 12:15.633
Hi, Dad!

12:15.633 --> 12:19.000
What's up, baby girl?
Hey, step child.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.133
Oh, hey!
So, Kourtney and I were just

12:22.133 --> 12:24.733
- wondering what you doing?
- Justin wants me to

12:24.733 --> 12:27.267
come meet him at Nice Guy, so
I'm about to roll over there

12:27.267 --> 12:29.367
- now.
- Okay, well...

12:29.367 --> 12:31.933
- What should we do?
- Well, listen, I mean,

12:31.933 --> 12:33.933
I think y'all should, like, meet
at Nice Guy, and then let this

12:33.933 --> 12:35.933
be like a little headquarters,
and then we'll just go from

12:35.933 --> 12:37.933
- there.
- We can have a drink

12:37.933 --> 12:39.933
- and figure it out.
- Yeah, whatever y'all

12:39.933 --> 12:41.933
- want.
- Headquarter it up!

12:41.933 --> 12:43.933
I'll be there in,
like, 15 minutes.

12:43.933 --> 12:45.933
We're gonna
headquarter it up.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.933
Yeah, yeah, that's
headquarters for now-- Nice Guy.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.600
Okay, see you soon,
Dad.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.267
I always thought my dad would
wear a gold diamond chain.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.467
All right, see y'all
soon.

12:55.467 --> 13:05.967
See you soon.♪ ♪

13:05.967 --> 13:09.433
- What are you doing?
- So I just learned that

13:09.433 --> 13:11.933
you can eat the skin off of a
kumquat.

13:11.933 --> 13:13.833
I've never had one.

13:16.033 --> 13:19.700
Is it sour?
Is it good?

13:19.700 --> 13:22.533
My mouth is getting all weird,
like it's sour now.

13:22.533 --> 13:26.767
- I think it's good.
- Oh!

13:26.767 --> 13:30.667
- Oh, that is so disgusting!
- You are such a piece of

13:30.667 --> 13:34.267
- for making me taste that!
- I like it.

13:34.267 --> 13:37.033
Mm-mm.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.300
- Hi, guys.
- Hi!

13:39.300 --> 13:42.533
Want to see how
cool I am today?

13:42.533 --> 13:45.767
- So cool.
- How great is that?

13:45.767 --> 13:48.533
Architectural
is a big deal.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.867
It's super cute,
right?

13:50.867 --> 13:53.300
Mm-hmm.
- I love the living room.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.800
- Me, too.
- It's so beautiful.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.867
And look at your back yard.
Look at you.

13:57.867 --> 14:01.233
The only thing I
cannot stand is a couple things.

14:01.233 --> 14:03.800
- Okay.
- So her room-- these

14:03.800 --> 14:06.433
drapes and chairs have got to
go.

14:06.433 --> 14:08.867
It just pisses the  out
of me.

14:08.867 --> 14:11.833
- Ooh.
- I cannot stand that

14:11.833 --> 14:14.233
flower arrangement.
Cannot stand those pieces of

14:14.233 --> 14:17.000
art, even though they are major
art, so it's fine.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.467
Khloe looks beautiful--
But this black

14:19.467 --> 14:22.933
couches, I would personally make
them white, just for life.

14:22.933 --> 14:26.167
Kourtney sometimes
thinks she's a design critic.

14:26.167 --> 14:29.367
And now she's criticizing
Khloe's house?

14:29.367 --> 14:32.933
Khloe's house is in
also,

14:32.933 --> 14:38.267
so Khloe must be doing something
right.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.867
Oh, oh!

14:40.867 --> 14:43.667
I can't.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.567
How was that kumquat?

14:48.933 --> 15:00.300
Very, very interesting.♪ ♪

15:00.300 --> 15:02.433
I wonder how my hair
looks today?

15:02.433 --> 15:04.967
- Why?
- 'Cause this is so short.

15:04.967 --> 15:07.833
- I feel like it doesn't blend.
- I love your hair.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.200
I just feel like I look
ugly today.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.533
- Well, look at me.
- I look like a

15:12.533 --> 15:14.800
- lumberjack.
- I love it.

15:14.800 --> 15:18.300
Wait, do you find it at all
bizarre that Kourtney and

15:18.300 --> 15:20.533
- Corey...?
- Are BFF?

15:20.533 --> 15:23.233
Are BFF.
Like, every photo I see of them,

15:23.233 --> 15:25.033
it's like they're leaving The
Nice Guy-- they're going to

15:25.033 --> 15:26.700
- dinner, they're doing this.
- That's all they do is

15:26.700 --> 15:28.467
- go to The Nice Guy.
- They're doing that, and

15:28.467 --> 15:30.200
I'm like, "What is going on?"
Did you see that hike

15:30.200 --> 15:31.900
they went on and they're,
like, posing together?

15:31.900 --> 15:33.567
- Yes!
- That was like--

15:33.567 --> 15:35.267
Wait, that looked
like a family photo.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.933
That was a family
photo, but not their family.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.600
That was so
inappropriate.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.933
- It was so ina-- right?
- I knew it wasn't just me

15:41.933 --> 15:44.667
that thought it was weird that
Kourtney and Corey are spending

15:44.667 --> 15:47.633
so much time together.
Him and Kourtney, they go out at

15:47.633 --> 15:50.467
night together.
They, like, hang out in the day.

15:50.467 --> 15:52.967
They go on hikes.
Like, they're always together.

15:52.967 --> 15:55.700
So I think I need to talk to
Kourtney just to kind of call

15:55.700 --> 15:58.200
her out on it.
I was, like, uncomfortable.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.200
- Mmm!
- Like, out of this world.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.267
That's the nail in the
coffin for me.

16:02.267 --> 16:04.400
- Seriously.
- #Okrrr?

16:04.400 --> 16:06.433
- Okrrr?
- Okrrr, okrrr, okrrr?

16:12.600 --> 16:15.333
Come on, Sean's
gonna make us a yummy lunch.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.300
Thank you.
That looks beautiful.

- Hey, Mom.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.633
- Hi, say hi to Kourtney.
- Hi, Rob.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.700
- Hey, Kourtney.
- We tried to

16:29.700 --> 16:31.867
FaceTime you yesterday, the
kids.

16:31.867 --> 16:35.300
Mason lost a tooth yesterday.
His second tooth.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.800
That's it?
I feel like he should've,

16:37.800 --> 16:39.800
should've lost way more teeth by
now.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.800
I don't think so.
I think it's like when you're

16:41.800 --> 16:43.833
- six.
- You start when

16:43.833 --> 16:45.833
- you're six, yeah.
- I don't know.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.833
My son started kind of early,
but--

16:47.833 --> 16:49.900
- Yeah, he did.
- What's your son's name,

16:49.900 --> 16:51.967
- Rob? I forgot.
- Robert.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.100
I thought it was

16:54.100 --> 16:56.900
- Cornelius.
- His name is Robert, uh,

16:56.900 --> 17:00.400
- III, actually.
- It feels really good to

17:00.400 --> 17:03.633
talk to Rob on the phone when
he's in such a good mood,

17:03.633 --> 17:06.400
because it's been a long time.
He's always had a sense of

17:06.400 --> 17:09.767
humor, and to get that back
is everything.

17:09.767 --> 17:13.133
Well, um, we move you in on
Wednesday.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.567
- What?
- Yeah.

17:16.567 --> 17:19.000
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, I can't wait to

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
put my  all over that
bed.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.833
Me, too.

17:24.833 --> 17:28.267
- No, I'm just kidding.
- Rob's excited about his

17:28.267 --> 17:32.300
new house.
And I can tell that Rob is

17:32.300 --> 17:35.067
getting really excited about
life again.

17:35.067 --> 17:37.800
And I just want to make sure
that he feels and remains

17:37.800 --> 17:42.567
independent and on his game.
So I want to help him get set up

17:42.567 --> 17:46.700
and basically help in any way
that I can if he needs me.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.000
- KoKo loco!
- All right, I'll talk

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
to you later.
Khloe's just walking in.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
- Hi, guys.
- Okay, love you.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
- Love you. Bye, honey.
- Hi, Khlo.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.400
- Oh, hello!
- I lost my tooth last

17:57.400 --> 17:59.400
- night!
- He lost his tooth

17:59.400 --> 18:00.933
last night.
Did I tell you?

18:00.933 --> 18:02.367
Wait, what did the
Tooth Fairy bring him?

18:02.367 --> 18:03.800
- Oh, hello!
- Ask him...

18:03.800 --> 18:05.633
- 100 bucks!
- What, Kourtney?

18:05.633 --> 18:07.933
- And what else?
- 100 bucks?

18:07.933 --> 18:11.333
Open your mouth.
Oh, that is so disgusting!

18:11.333 --> 18:14.633
- Kourtney, you gave him $100?
- No, I tried to find

18:14.633 --> 18:16.467
- the two-dollar bills last night.
- I gave her a stack of

18:16.467 --> 18:17.867
two-dollar bills.
- So you deprived... so

18:17.867 --> 18:19.967
- instead, let's do $100?
- That's all I had in

18:19.967 --> 18:22.633
- my bedroom.
- I'm going to your

18:22.633 --> 18:24.167
house and I'm ripping out a
tooth.

18:24.167 --> 18:27.000
- I'll just tell you that.
- So I wanted to tell you

18:27.000 --> 18:29.733
- something.
- Oh, my God.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.667
Um, so you know how I
helped Kylie get a house?

18:32.667 --> 18:36.067
- Okay.
- So Robert is doing the

18:36.067 --> 18:44.467
same thing, and he's getting a
house.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.300
You think it's
good?

18:46.300 --> 18:49.800
It's really good.
It's his money.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.733
It's not his money,
'cause I know how much money he

18:51.733 --> 18:53.067
- has in his account.
- Yes, it is.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.433
He has enough money for a down
payment.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.000
- Yes, he does.
- You are one of the

18:56.000 --> 18:59.267
- world's biggest liars.
- Biggest enablers.

18:59.267 --> 19:03.133
- I'm not a liar.
- You are lying.

19:03.133 --> 19:06.400
My assistants, as I told you
yesterday, will not help you

19:06.400 --> 19:08.700
with one thing in regards to
Rob's move.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.567
Rob's not inconveniencing my
life.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.200
- Okay.
- He's done that enough,

19:12.200 --> 19:16.367
- for years.
- Kourtney Kardashian.

19:16.367 --> 19:18.867
Mm-hmm.
- She is getting a little

19:18.867 --> 19:21.533
- carried away with herself.
- Kourtney has become,

19:21.533 --> 19:29.100
- like, the new diva.
- Yeah.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.800
You are one of the
world's biggest liars.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.767
Biggest enablers.
I'm not a liar.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.467
- You are lying.
- No, he has the money

19:36.467 --> 19:40.000
- for the down payment.
- Like, seriously,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.900
- everyone...
- What? What did I do

19:41.900 --> 19:43.467
now?
Why are you so angry all the

19:43.467 --> 19:45.100
- time?
- Oh, I'm not...

19:45.100 --> 19:48.233
Do you have a cough?

19:48.233 --> 19:50.200
I'm just allergic to.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.300
Oh, okay.

19:52.300 --> 19:56.000
I would have such deep
fights in my family because I

19:56.000 --> 19:58.867
was "enabling" Rob by letting
him live with me.

19:58.867 --> 20:01.300
And then the one person who
yelled at me the most, which is

20:01.300 --> 20:07.100
my mom, now she's helping Rob?
I just find it mind-blowing.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.800
He's very excited and I
want you to be supportive and

20:09.800 --> 20:11.800
- get on board.
- I don't even talk to

20:11.800 --> 20:13.300
- Rob.
- I know, but just if you

20:13.300 --> 20:15.200
happen to see him.

20:28.667 --> 20:31.800
Hi.
Where were you?

20:31.800 --> 20:34.133
- Where'd you just come from?
- From the back.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.967
Oh.
How good does a crepe sound?

20:36.967 --> 20:39.333
I hate crepes.
They make me think of, like,

20:39.333 --> 20:41.867
- eating a dead body or something.
- Oh, my God, I love

20:41.867 --> 20:44.333
- that consistency.
- Disgusting.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.767
P and North were so
funny.

20:46.767 --> 20:50.000
They were hanging out and then P
was like, "When I grow up, I'm

20:50.000 --> 20:52.633
gonna be a doctor or something."
And then North was like, "When I

20:52.633 --> 20:55.600
grow up," whatever, and then P's
like, "You're not growing up.

20:55.600 --> 21:00.767
You're getting littler."
And then North goes, "Ah!"

21:00.767 --> 21:03.333
And then I go, "P, I think you
hurt North's feelings," and then

21:03.333 --> 21:06.033
P goes, "Ah!"
And just, like, they were both

21:06.033 --> 21:09.533
- hysterically crying.
- Thank you.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.733
So you're going to
church tonight?

21:12.733 --> 21:14.700
Mm-hmm.
- Does Corey go to that?

21:14.700 --> 21:19.233
No. He doesn't.
But... I feel like he'll go out.

21:19.233 --> 21:21.567
Like, if I'm ever, like...
Like, he totally would've come

21:21.567 --> 21:23.300
- last night.
- Yeah.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.100
But it was just,
like, so last-minute.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.967
Is that weird, that you
go out with Corey, like,

21:26.967 --> 21:32.933
- partying on your nights out?
- No, it's not weird.

21:32.933 --> 21:35.767
But, like, do you love
hanging with him?

21:35.767 --> 21:38.300
Yeah.
I mean, he's fun.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.433
You just need to get to know him
better.

21:40.433 --> 21:44.267
Yeah.
I obviously live with him...

21:44.267 --> 21:46.100
Mm-hmm.
- ...at Mom's house, but I

21:46.100 --> 21:48.400
feel like I don't even know
where he's from.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.867
- Or, like, does he have sisters?
- He's from Hotlanta.

21:51.867 --> 21:57.067
He is?
I just don't know much.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.633
Just ask him what
you want to know.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.533
But I don't think you need to be
that nosy, either.

22:02.533 --> 22:07.767
Like... just, like, if you know
things when you know them.

22:07.767 --> 22:11.667
Like, I don't know...
"Kanye, like, where did you go

22:11.667 --> 22:14.567
to high school?"
I don't either.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.267
You know, like...

22:16.267 --> 22:22.100
That's what I'm saying.
Like, who even cares?

22:29.833 --> 22:32.467
- Shana. Hi.
- Hi.

22:32.467 --> 22:35.100
- So, this is our...
- Courtyard.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.900
- ...fabulous courtyard.
- ♪ Ah. ♪

22:37.900 --> 22:41.467
♪ Ah! ♪
So I was thinking this could use

22:41.467 --> 22:43.667
- a couple of trees.
- Absolutely.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.233
Well, I already found lemon
trees...

22:45.233 --> 22:46.733
- You're the best.
- ...I already found

22:46.733 --> 22:50.500
kumquat trees, and then we can
also get a vine back here in it

22:50.500 --> 22:52.867
- and then kind of get it...
- Oh, gotcha.

22:52.867 --> 22:54.833
- You know what I mean?
- Perfect. Love it.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.167
- Love.
- Okay.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.800
And I'll show you the
other couple areas, if you don't

22:57.800 --> 22:59.367
- mind.
- No, let's do that.

22:59.367 --> 23:01.600
- Yeah.
- This pool... I mean,

23:01.600 --> 23:03.500
- I'm excited for...
- Rob.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.967
- Yeah.
- Isn't that exciting?

23:04.967 --> 23:06.333
Yeah, this is
fabulous.

23:06.333 --> 23:07.867
Yeah, I'm pretty happy
for him.

23:07.867 --> 23:09.500
- All right.
- He's really turned a

23:09.500 --> 23:11.967
- corner and... yeah.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

23:11.967 --> 23:13.933
Yeah. And he, like,
really loves this

23:13.933 --> 23:16.267
- responsibility, you know?
- I love that.

23:16.267 --> 23:18.000
It's really cool.
So I'm happy.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.167
Rob is moving into his new house
tomorrow and there's a ton of

23:23.167 --> 23:27.233
stuff to get done, but I'm just
happy that Rob gets to have his

23:27.233 --> 23:30.900
own place again and kind of get
his life back together.

23:30.900 --> 23:34.300
Okay...
This...

23:34.300 --> 23:39.733
Hi, Khlo.

23:39.733 --> 23:42.333
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

23:42.333 --> 23:45.233
It seems like you're
wanting to take quite a

23:45.233 --> 23:48.133
ton of my stuff when you told me
you only needed a few things.

23:48.133 --> 23:50.400
Well, I just...
Those are kind of, like, I'm

23:50.400 --> 23:52.800
just...
I'm just saying...

23:52.800 --> 23:56.233
Also, my assistants,
as I told you yesterday, will

23:56.233 --> 23:58.900
not help you with one thing in
regards to Rob's move.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.500
- I cannot...
- I don't, I don't need

24:01.500 --> 24:03.167
her to help me.
I just needed to find out which

24:03.167 --> 24:06.100
- of those things are available.
- Right, and you wanted

24:06.100 --> 24:09.633
- them to set up movers?
- Oh, I just didn't know

24:09.633 --> 24:11.667
if you guys had somebody you
used or not.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.267
No, they're not doing
anything.

24:13.267 --> 24:14.800
They're not doing a single
thing.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.667
Like, my people are busy.
We have other jobs over here.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.500
- Okay.
- Rob's not

24:19.500 --> 24:21.233
- inconveniencing my life.
- Okay.

24:21.233 --> 24:25.133
He's done that enough,
for years.

24:25.133 --> 24:27.300
What happened here,
Robert?

24:27.300 --> 24:29.433
- Talk to Kourtney.
- Kourtney!

24:29.433 --> 24:31.400
Kourtney, you totally messed up
my little thing going on that I

24:31.400 --> 24:33.833
- really liked.
- It's really cool

24:33.833 --> 24:35.900
- for, like, a girl.
- A girl?

24:35.900 --> 24:38.467
- Yes.
- So I take it you

24:38.467 --> 24:40.667
won't be sending Rob a
housewarming gift.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.767
He doesn't call to
check on me or to say hi and

24:42.767 --> 24:44.767
- that hurts my feelings.
- And that doesn't mean

24:44.767 --> 24:46.667
he doesn't think about you.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.300
- Okay, love the house.
- You do?

25:00.300 --> 25:01.833
Love.
First of all, this is my first

25:01.833 --> 25:04.300
install not seeing a project.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.167
- You are so crazy.
- Faye Resnick is one of

25:07.167 --> 25:10.700
my best friends and she's an
amazing interior designer and

25:10.700 --> 25:14.533
has very graciously agreed to
help me with Project Rob, as we

25:14.533 --> 25:17.167
call it.
So I got four barstools...

25:17.167 --> 25:19.633
- I love it.
- ...I got three beds and

25:19.633 --> 25:22.633
then I got four big doo-dahs
over there.

25:22.633 --> 25:23.967
Chairs for the fire
pit?

25:23.967 --> 25:25.367
- Yeah.
- The doo-dahs are always

25:25.367 --> 25:26.567
- good.
- Yes, the doo-dahs are

25:26.567 --> 25:28.433
- good.
- It's beautiful, Kris.

25:28.433 --> 25:31.433
It's been a labor of
love, for sure, and I'm so

25:31.433 --> 25:36.333
excited to get his house all set
up and help him get settled in.

25:36.333 --> 25:39.067
Ooh, I love those
chairs.

25:39.067 --> 25:41.300
- Hey, Kris.
- Yeah?

25:41.300 --> 25:43.367
Your baby is here.
Yo.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.000
Hi!

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
- Welcome home!
- Yay.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.400
Hey, we have to start
at the front.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.800
- Hi, Kourt.
- Hey, Mom.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.567
You guys have to come
in the front.

25:52.567 --> 25:55.133
You've been up since,
like, 5:00 a.m. doing this?

25:55.133 --> 25:56.867
- For two days.
- Faye.

25:56.867 --> 25:59.267
Oh, my God!
Congratulations.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.200
- Thank you, thank you.
- Hi.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.833
- Hi.
- What's up?

26:03.833 --> 26:07.033
Kourtney and I want to
see Rob's new place and make him

26:07.033 --> 26:10.133
feel welcomed.
It makes me happy that he's

26:10.133 --> 26:12.867
just, you know, feeling better
about himself.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.000
And I know that my mom's really
happy.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.500
Like, he hasn't been like this
in so long.

26:17.500 --> 26:21.533
- It's, like, so refreshing.
- I love those big cups.

26:21.533 --> 26:24.900
- Where are those from?
- Those are what I

26:24.900 --> 26:27.700
have, and of course, she copies.
It's like, I want to be the one

26:27.700 --> 26:30.800
person...
Mom, it's just not cool that you

26:30.800 --> 26:34.800
copy me.
Like, I go to lengths to try to

26:34.800 --> 26:36.900
get things that not everybody
has.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.467
Okay, well, I can't
return those.

26:38.467 --> 26:40.433
I bought them all
for  Khloe...

26:40.433 --> 26:42.333
Then I'll maybe have to buy
them.

26:42.333 --> 26:45.000
'Cause it's not cool.
Just no one copy me.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.700
I go through a lot of work to
get things.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.467
I heard you the first
time.

26:49.467 --> 26:52.300
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Okay, so look at the

26:52.300 --> 26:54.367
office, and tell me what you
think.

26:54.367 --> 26:56.433
Faye's been working her ass off,
too.

26:56.433 --> 26:58.633
- Rob, that's your dad's desk.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

26:58.633 --> 27:00.633
That's good.
I remember that one.

27:00.633 --> 27:02.633
- It's perfect.
- I don't like this

27:02.633 --> 27:04.633
- rug in here.
- No?

27:04.633 --> 27:07.300
- I don't.
- Kris?

27:07.300 --> 27:11.400
- He loves it!
- Honey, I really, really

27:11.400 --> 27:14.333
really dig the rug in there.
I think it speaks to your

27:14.333 --> 27:16.467
father.
It just reminds me of...

27:16.467 --> 27:19.533
- Yeah.
- What?

27:19.533 --> 27:22.200
That piece, Kourtney?
The rug in-in his office.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.200
- I dig it.
- Really?

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
I think it reminds me
of your father.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.200
I think it brings an old world,
because we've got so much edgy

27:28.200 --> 27:30.433
- stuff going on.
- Yeah, I just feel

27:30.433 --> 27:33.233
like it's so traditional for,
like, Rob.

27:33.233 --> 27:35.767
- What do you think, Rob?
- Honestly, I'm so bad

27:35.767 --> 27:38.967
- with everything.
- We can't have

27:38.967 --> 27:41.067
feminine  in here.
So we're gonna go through it and

27:41.067 --> 27:43.267
- guess who's gonna help you?
- You.

27:43.267 --> 27:46.167
Me.
Let's remove the stuff and then

27:46.167 --> 27:50.000
see if we like it.
It's fine if you're a female,

27:50.000 --> 27:54.400
but maybe not for, for like a
young, dope guy, who has the

27:54.400 --> 27:57.467
dopest sister with the best
taste in interiors in the, on

27:57.467 --> 28:00.567
- the planet.
- Kourtney's just, like,

28:00.567 --> 28:03.100
taking over.
I mean, I get it-- Kourtney's on

28:03.100 --> 28:05.600
Architectural
but still, it doesn't

28:05.600 --> 28:08.367
mean she's, like, the expert at
everything.

28:08.367 --> 28:10.867
Oh, what happened here,
Robert?

28:10.867 --> 28:12.867
- What? Hmm?
- All of the good stuff

28:12.867 --> 28:14.867
- is now all gone?
- I don't know, Kourt--

28:14.867 --> 28:16.867
That's Kourt, Kourt--
Okay, that's gonna

28:16.867 --> 28:18.867
- upset me.
- Talk to Kourtney.

28:18.867 --> 28:20.867
- Talk to Kourtney.
- Kourtney?

28:20.867 --> 28:23.000
- Let's talk to Kourtney.
- Kourtney!

28:23.000 --> 28:25.200
Kourtney cannot control
the whole show.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.433
Kourtney, you totally messed up
my little thing going on that I

28:27.433 --> 28:29.767
- really liked.
- What? I know.

28:29.767 --> 28:33.700
So I really liked it, but I feel
like it's really cool for, like,

28:33.700 --> 28:37.333
- a girl.
- A girl?

28:37.333 --> 28:39.333
- Yes.
- Those are the most

28:39.333 --> 28:41.000
- masculine pieces.
- Really?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.667
- Yes!
- Rob said he didn't

28:42.667 --> 28:44.333
- like them.
- Because you told him

28:44.333 --> 28:46.000
- that you didn't like them.
- No, no, no, I said,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
no, no, no, I didn't.
I swear I said...

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
- Don't put it on me.
- I said, "What do

28:50.000 --> 28:52.133
you like on top of here?"
And he said, "Nothing."

28:52.133 --> 28:55.200
Okay, now it was so
exciting and now it's so boring.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.200
Look what you did,
Kourtney.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.800
Faye did this because
she loves me and she loves Rob.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.233
And she's really good at what
she does.

29:04.233 --> 29:07.500
So for Kourtney to come in and
criticize anything is just

29:07.500 --> 29:10.767
- embarrassing.
- Now I'm really sad.

29:10.767 --> 29:13.700
You don't think it's
weird that Rob, like, hasn't

29:13.700 --> 29:17.033
- called me one time?
- I think he felt that

29:17.033 --> 29:20.067
you were just very judgmental.
He doesn't really hold a grudge

29:20.067 --> 29:22.067
and he's--
What would he hold a

29:22.067 --> 29:24.067
- grudge over?
- And he doesn't really--

29:24.067 --> 29:26.433
Me taking care of him
for six years?

29:26.433 --> 29:28.867
Like, I never had this
dynamic, this  y'all have

29:28.867 --> 29:31.367
- just don't exist.
- Is that why you hang

29:31.367 --> 29:38.133
around Kourt and the kids so
much?

29:43.300 --> 29:45.200
Hello?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.500
I'm in the office.

29:50.967 --> 29:53.133
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:53.133 --> 29:55.567
Your hair looks good.
I like the light ends.

29:55.567 --> 29:57.867
- Thank you.
- Yeah, it looks good--

29:57.867 --> 29:59.867
It's just annoying
because they're all pieces this

29:59.867 --> 30:02.333
way so close, 'cause I didn't
really dye my hair.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.667
Mm-hmm.
- So all the light pieces

30:04.667 --> 30:07.300
are just, like, these tape-ins.
Lame.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.633
Lame.
Speaking of lame...

30:09.633 --> 30:11.767
- your sister.
Mm-hmm.

30:11.767 --> 30:14.267
- Kourtney Kardashian.
Mm-hmm.

30:14.267 --> 30:17.667
Designer, decorator,
home enthusiast...

30:17.667 --> 30:21.800
- Extraordinaire.
- She is really getting a

30:21.800 --> 30:24.567
little carried away with
herself.

30:24.567 --> 30:28.967
I feel really bad because, you
know, I asked Faye to help me

30:28.967 --> 30:33.300
move Rob into his new house, and
so we were having so much fun,

30:33.300 --> 30:36.933
and she came in and just pretty
much made us feel like we were

30:36.933 --> 30:42.233
idiots.
And she just feels like she's

30:42.233 --> 30:47.167
the expert on all things design
and decorating.

30:47.167 --> 30:49.633
- She's getting so crazy.
- She's pretty good at it,

30:49.633 --> 30:51.933
- but she is getting crazy.
- I just felt really bad

30:51.933 --> 30:53.933
- for Faye...
- That's Kourtney.

30:53.933 --> 30:55.933
I think I'm gonna say
something.

30:55.933 --> 30:57.933
It's just not okay to be that
rude.

30:57.933 --> 30:59.933
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:59.933 --> 31:01.933
Kourtney's become, like,
the new diva.

31:01.933 --> 31:04.433
Yeah.

31:04.433 --> 31:08.200
Speak of that little devil,
she's texting me now.

31:18.367 --> 31:21.767
I have so much work to
do, I just can't function.

31:21.767 --> 31:26.567
- You're always working.
- What is going on?

31:26.567 --> 31:30.400
Nothing much.
Same old, same old-- just taking

31:30.400 --> 31:35.167
- care of your queen and...
- What a fun job you have.

31:35.167 --> 31:39.767
- And why do you like her?
- 'Cause we're both

31:39.767 --> 31:42.033
crazy.
She just shows hers more than

31:42.033 --> 31:44.933
I-- she-- I show mine.
I just think mine.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.933
- She...
- Yeah.

31:46.933 --> 31:48.933
...let it out all day,
so, but we've been coexisting

31:48.933 --> 31:50.933
good.
It's fun, she's just fun.

31:50.933 --> 31:52.933
- We're just alike.
- Yeah.

31:52.933 --> 31:55.200
She's just mom and I'm
just... me.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.900
Yeah.
You know, I'm always with Corey.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.567
But I just don't feel like I've,
you know, really taken the time

32:00.567 --> 32:03.267
to sit down and talk to him.
And Corey's been around for a

32:03.267 --> 32:05.267
while.
I don't think he's going

32:05.267 --> 32:07.700
anywhere.
So, you know, maybe it's time

32:07.700 --> 32:10.133
that I do really, you know,
start hanging with him and

32:10.133 --> 32:12.533
getting to know him better.
Do you, um, have any brothers or

32:12.533 --> 32:14.900
- sisters?
- Yeah, I've got

32:14.900 --> 32:17.400
- half sisters, a half brother...
- Really?

32:17.400 --> 32:20.167
They're younger than
me, so I-I was like, long gone

32:20.167 --> 32:24.167
and kind of like our worlds
never were together.

32:24.167 --> 32:27.167
- Hmm, interesting.
- But my family dynamics

32:27.167 --> 32:29.633
is not y'all's, so what y'all
see as normal, I don't see that

32:29.633 --> 32:32.233
as, like, it's not
like that.

32:32.233 --> 32:35.600
Like, I have my, li-like my
closer cousins with me were on

32:35.600 --> 32:38.033
my dad's side, but they all,
they were always way older than

32:38.033 --> 32:40.433
me, but they used to babysit me
when I was little.

32:40.433 --> 32:43.867
And, um, I never had the house
full of people.

32:43.867 --> 32:47.000
It was like me and my dad, then
my friends, then, like, his

32:47.000 --> 32:51.267
girlfriend's kids would become,
like, my sisters and brothers.

32:51.267 --> 32:53.967
Like I never had this dynamic,
this  that y'all have, I

32:53.967 --> 32:57.600
don't, it just don't exist.
Y'all got a great--

32:57.600 --> 33:00.900
So because you don't
have that, like a close family,

33:00.900 --> 33:03.733
is that why you hang around
Kourt and the kids so much?

33:03.733 --> 33:06.067
Yeah, you guys are
family.

33:06.067 --> 33:09.733
Listening to Corey talk
was just all coming together and

33:09.733 --> 33:13.367
making sense to me why he loves
spending time with our family

33:13.367 --> 33:16.033
and with, you know, Kourtney and
the kids.

33:16.033 --> 33:18.033
A lot of my friends
and people I've met along my

33:18.033 --> 33:20.033
journey have become closer to me
than my family.

33:20.033 --> 33:22.033
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm

33:22.033 --> 33:24.067
saying, I mean, I got all kinds
of friends.

33:24.067 --> 33:26.067
I got big friends, I got little
friends.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.067
North is your little
friend.

33:28.067 --> 33:30.500
- That's my girl.
- I think sometimes when

33:30.500 --> 33:33.400
you have such a big family, it's
so like the norm that I hear

33:33.400 --> 33:37.500
about Corey's life and it just,
you know, makes me feel really

33:37.500 --> 33:40.133
lucky that I do have such a big
family.

33:40.133 --> 33:42.900
So to find someone that just
kind of fits in and is so chill

33:42.900 --> 33:46.100
and goes with the flow is like
really, I think, a blessing to

33:46.100 --> 33:49.300
my mom.
Where does your dad leave?

33:49.300 --> 33:51.600
- Atlanta.
- So he's still there?

33:51.600 --> 33:53.867
Mm-hmm.
Now, my dad now, me and him

33:53.867 --> 33:56.733
tight.
I-I talk to my dad every day.

33:56.733 --> 33:59.600
I love my dad to death.
I mean, if it wasn't for my dad,

33:59.600 --> 34:01.767
there's no telling where my life
would be.

34:01.767 --> 34:04.367
- So, y'all are like my dad.
- Yeah, I want to meet

34:04.367 --> 34:06.967
- him.
- Yeah, so I think I

34:06.967 --> 34:09.567
- might take your mom to Atlanta.
- That would be fun.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.900
- You should.
- I'm thinking about it.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.433
That would be so fun.
She would like it.

34:14.433 --> 34:17.667
Cheers to that.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.700
- Hello!
- Hi! How are you?

34:30.700 --> 34:33.000
- You look beautiful.
- Nice to see you!

34:33.000 --> 34:35.033
- Sorry we're late.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

34:35.033 --> 34:37.700
Yay! Let's go do this.
Today, Khloe and I are shooting

34:37.700 --> 34:41.800
a piece for College Humor with
my girlfriend Rita Wilson.

34:41.800 --> 34:45.500
Every time I get the opportunity
to do something way out of my

34:45.500 --> 34:48.967
box is really fun.
And to also to be able to do it

34:48.967 --> 34:51.067
with my daughter and my
girlfriend, it's gonna be a fun

34:51.067 --> 34:54.533
- day.
- My character's name is

34:54.533 --> 34:56.767
- Anita.
- Anita.

34:56.767 --> 35:01.033
- Anita Taiton.
- And action!

35:01.033 --> 35:03.300
- Rita?
- Oh, ladies...

35:03.300 --> 35:05.300
- It's Anita.
- Anita!

35:05.300 --> 35:08.333
- Sorry.
- Acting! Acting!

35:08.333 --> 35:11.367
Khloe goes, Khloe
goes, "It's Anita."

35:11.367 --> 35:14.800
- And action!
- Rita...

35:14.800 --> 35:19.300
This is going to take
all day.

35:26.767 --> 35:29.533
Mmm.
So yummy.

35:29.533 --> 35:34.200
I didn't really eat very much
for a couple days.

35:34.200 --> 35:38.700
- Why not?
- I was just so busy.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.700
How is the Rob move
going?

35:41.700 --> 35:43.867
- It's done.
- Good.

35:43.867 --> 35:46.300
Just doing the blinds
on Monday and the Internet goes

35:46.300 --> 35:49.000
- in on Monday.
- Hope he says "thank

35:49.000 --> 35:51.333
- you" to you.
- He did, yesterday.

35:51.333 --> 35:54.667
I thought he was gonna cry.
He was so sweet.

35:54.667 --> 35:57.600
I want you to come see the
house.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.400
I will.
Whenever he feels like inviting

35:59.400 --> 36:00.833
- me.
- I think you'd really

36:00.833 --> 36:02.367
- like it.
- You don't think it's

36:02.367 --> 36:04.367
weird that Rob, like, hasn't
called me one time?

36:04.367 --> 36:06.000
I don't think it's
weird.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.633
I think it's certainly
disappointing for you and I

36:08.633 --> 36:11.267
would want him to call me, too,
but I think you guys just see

36:11.267 --> 36:14.500
this whole thing differently.
And I think he knows that he

36:14.500 --> 36:16.800
probably should've talked to you
about it, but felt that you were

36:16.800 --> 36:21.933
just very judgmental.
He doesn't really hold a grudge.

36:21.933 --> 36:23.767
What would he hold a
grudge over?

36:23.767 --> 36:25.633
- I mean, he doesn't...
- Me taking care of him

36:25.633 --> 36:28.700
for six years?
What I'm so confused about is

36:28.700 --> 36:32.267
why Rob has such issues with me,
all of a sudden.

36:32.267 --> 36:35.700
I'm allowed to say I don't want
strangers in my home.

36:35.700 --> 36:39.267
I just want Rob to reach out to
me, so I'm just waiting.

36:39.267 --> 36:41.967
- It's the waiting game.
- Boys are different and

36:41.967 --> 36:44.300
he's very sensitive.
I didn't realize how sensitive

36:44.300 --> 36:48.867
he is.
And I think he... loves you very

36:48.867 --> 36:55.933
- much.
- He shows it.

36:55.933 --> 36:58.167
What do you want me
to do, come over and lie?

36:58.167 --> 37:00.233
No, but I just feel
like Faye had worked so hard all

37:00.233 --> 37:02.467
- day...
- Do you want Rob to

37:02.467 --> 37:10.100
just live with things that are
very feminine?

37:20.233 --> 37:23.267
Um, my table.
Nice.

37:23.267 --> 37:25.933
- How nice.
- I love this table.

37:25.933 --> 37:28.400
- Hey, guys.
- I want you guys to

37:28.400 --> 37:33.800
know, this is a non-organic
banana, because it is

37:33.800 --> 37:39.233
- hard to open, "A"...
- Oh,.

37:39.233 --> 37:42.600
And bananas aren't meant to be
this large.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.467
- Really?
Mm-hmm.

37:44.467 --> 37:47.033
What color is an egg
yolk supposed to be?

37:47.033 --> 37:50.100
- Orange.
- Good answer.

37:50.100 --> 37:54.233
What kind of pool
towels should I get?

37:54.233 --> 37:56.400
- Mmm...
- Like, do you just get

37:56.400 --> 37:58.567
'em at Bed, Bath & Beyond, or,
like, what's the...

37:58.567 --> 38:00.533
I'm not telling you
where I got mine, 'cause I don't

38:00.533 --> 38:04.033
- want you to copy me.
- You know, Kourtney,

38:04.033 --> 38:06.467
there's something I really want
to talk to you about.

38:06.467 --> 38:09.267
- All righty.
- You have a certain

38:09.267 --> 38:11.600
- beautiful style...
Mm-hmm.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.933
...and your home is
insanely beautiful.

38:13.933 --> 38:15.567
Mm-hmm.
- And I couldn't be

38:15.567 --> 38:17.967
- happier for my firstborn child.
Mm-hmm.

38:17.967 --> 38:23.000
Believe me.
But sometimes, you tend to be

38:23.000 --> 38:29.900
the authority on everything
decorating.

38:29.900 --> 38:34.867
You were very, very opinionated
and Faye had worked so hard all

38:34.867 --> 38:36.700
- day...
- Do you want Rob to

38:36.700 --> 38:39.900
just live with things that are
very feminine?

38:39.900 --> 38:42.433
What do you want me to do, come
over and lie?

38:42.433 --> 38:45.467
I mean, done in a day or
whatever she did, it was fine,

38:45.467 --> 38:47.233
but, like, you can't, like,
fault someone...

38:47.233 --> 38:48.867
But don't do it in
a day.

38:48.867 --> 38:51.167
Who wants to do their house in a
day?

38:51.167 --> 38:56.900
How are you going to expect me
to do my work if you don't let

38:56.900 --> 39:01.767
me do so freely and have
something called an opinión?

39:01.767 --> 39:05.767
Which is very valued and many,
many, many people around the

39:05.767 --> 39:08.933
- world would love it.
- Are you on Team Kanye?

39:08.933 --> 39:11.367
Yes.

39:11.367 --> 39:13.433
I am.
He inspires me.

39:13.433 --> 39:16.600
But I'm sorry if I came off
insulting.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.633
That wasn't my intention.
I really didn't mean to insult

39:20.633 --> 39:24.267
all of the hard work that Faye
put into the home.

39:24.267 --> 39:27.767
But I also just really want Rob
to be happy and I know that he

39:27.767 --> 39:30.267
doesn't want to hurt my mom's
feelings, so I'll hurt her

39:30.267 --> 39:33.733
- feelings for him.
- I decided I think I'm

39:33.733 --> 39:38.367
gonna hang up my mover's hat.
The next time one of you guys

39:38.367 --> 39:42.000
decides to move, I'm going to
retire.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.333
I'm stepping away.
Everybody knows what they're

39:44.333 --> 39:47.300
doing and I think everybody's
ready to go out on their own

39:47.300 --> 39:50.367
- and, like, leave the nest.
- I feel you.

39:50.367 --> 39:53.733
It's so hard to have so many
kids.

40:00.067 --> 40:02.900
- A little hot out here.
- This sun is testing

40:02.900 --> 40:06.767
my Botox in a major way.
Ooh! Ah!

40:06.767 --> 40:10.633
What's going on, kiddo?
You look stressed on your

40:10.633 --> 40:13.567
- face... or is that just the sun?
- I think just the sun.

40:13.567 --> 40:15.033
Yeah.
'Cause you're too pretty to

40:15.033 --> 40:16.833
- stress.
- Ah! Yeah.

40:16.833 --> 40:18.900
- I wish stress...
- Cared?

40:18.900 --> 40:20.533
...monitored
prettiness.

40:20.533 --> 40:23.033
So I take it you
won't be sending Rob a

40:23.033 --> 40:25.533
- housewarming gift.
- No.

40:25.533 --> 40:27.467
- He should be sending me one.
- Do you even talk to

40:27.467 --> 40:29.533
- him? Like...
- No.

40:29.533 --> 40:32.033
He doesn't call to check on me
or to say "hi" or, like, "I miss

40:32.033 --> 40:35.267
you," like...
He's lived with me for how many

40:35.267 --> 40:38.167
years and you're just like...
You're okay just, like,

40:38.167 --> 40:40.700
completely leaving and not
saying a thing to me?

40:40.700 --> 40:42.667
- That hurts my feelings.
- That doesn't mean he

40:42.667 --> 40:44.867
- doesn't think about you.
- But it shouldn't be

40:44.867 --> 40:46.600
okay for people just to leave
that easily.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.200
Well, then, why don't
you tell him he's hurting your

40:48.200 --> 40:49.700
- feelings?
- 'Cause he doesn't

40:49.700 --> 40:51.333
- care. That's...
- How's he... how do

40:51.333 --> 40:52.700
you know?
You guys could be thinking the

40:52.700 --> 40:55.600
exact same thing about each
other.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.867
Rob has always been my
best friend.

40:58.867 --> 41:02.700
Even though the world might have
been removed from Rob for the

41:02.700 --> 41:05.333
past few years, I never have
been.

41:05.333 --> 41:09.767
I've always been by Rob's side
and loyal to a fault, so I never

41:09.767 --> 41:14.300
imagined, out of any sibling,
that he would be able to cut me

41:14.300 --> 41:17.367
- off the way that he has.
You're-you're more

41:17.367 --> 41:19.833
emotionally stable.
Why don't you be the bigger

41:19.833 --> 41:22.733
person?

41:33.533 --> 41:35.433
Try to call Rob...

41:38.500 --> 41:42.433
Perfect. No answer.
What else is new?

41:42.433 --> 41:47.900
Oh, that's cute.
Little gray house.

41:47.900 --> 41:50.000
Oh, my God, it's so cute here.

41:57.967 --> 42:02.367
Looks cute.

42:02.367 --> 42:05.367
That plant is dead.
Oh...

42:05.367 --> 42:07.067
Hi, Juanita!
Is Robert here?

42:07.067 --> 42:08.333
- No.
- Oh, he's not here?

42:08.333 --> 42:09.800
- No.
- Okay.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.433
Well, thank you.
I was just gonna say "hi."

42:12.433 --> 42:16.167
Thank you.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.800
Oh, well.
I tried.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.800
Hello?

42:21.800 --> 42:25.200
Are you sleeping at
2:30 in the afternoon?

42:25.200 --> 42:28.600
Yeah, 'cause I woke
up at 4:30 this morning to get

42:28.600 --> 42:32.233
- my hair done.
- Well, I know you told

42:32.233 --> 42:34.767
me that I should try to make the
first move with Rob because you

42:34.767 --> 42:38.600
know he won't.
So I called him; of course, he

42:38.600 --> 42:40.767
doesn't answer.
But I drove by his new house,

42:40.767 --> 42:43.467
just to go pop up and, like, say
"hi" and, like, whatever, and he

42:43.467 --> 42:46.133
wasn't home or I don't know
what.

42:46.133 --> 42:51.733
- Just keep trying.
- Yeah.

42:51.733 --> 42:54.100
Just keeping trying.
You know, I'm a little

42:54.100 --> 42:56.667
frustrated about this whole
situation, 'cause I feel like

42:56.667 --> 43:00.033
this is just getting dragged out
way longer than it needs to.

43:00.033 --> 43:04.233
I decide to just be the bigger
person and I don't really see

43:04.233 --> 43:06.967
the effort he's making on his
end.

43:06.967 --> 43:09.667
So I'm not really sure what else
to do, as of now.

43:09.667 --> 43:11.433
Well, I'm proud of
you.

43:11.433 --> 43:15.500
Well, I love you.
Thank you. Just had to vent.

43:15.500 --> 43:19.467
- ♪ ♪- Coming up next week...

43:19.467 --> 43:24.567
My mom is insane.
My entire room is cleared out.

43:24.567 --> 43:26.767
It really annoys me
that you guys come to the city

43:26.767 --> 43:29.433
- and don't hang out with me.
- We, like, forget.

43:29.433 --> 43:31.733
I do love my career,
but I feel like I'm missing out

43:31.733 --> 43:34.067
on certain things at home.
I don't want to be forgotten

43:34.067 --> 43:36.967
- just 'cause I work a lot.
- Rob went on his

43:36.967 --> 43:39.433
Instagram, making fun of the
food that I bought.

43:39.433 --> 43:41.167
There's no way I'm
going to let my brother

43:41.167 --> 43:43.500
disrespect her.
You're blasting Mom and it's

43:43.500 --> 43:46.167
petty as.
