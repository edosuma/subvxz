WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:04.872
* Light's camera action

00:06.140 --> 00:08.042
* My girl's got Von Weber

00:08.076 --> 00:10.244
* Your girl she could
do it better *

00:10.278 --> 00:12.380
* My girl's got Von Weber

00:12.413 --> 00:15.049
* And they hatin'
on my mad cheddar *

00:15.083 --> 00:17.318
* My girl's got Von Weber

00:17.351 --> 00:18.252
- Turn that racket down!

00:18.286 --> 00:19.287
I'm trying to work.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.156
It sounds like there's
a DJ spinning it in here.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.524
- [screaming] It's
not that loud, Jill.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.525
- [screaming]
Mom, do you even

00:24.558 --> 00:27.328
understand how cool
it is that my last name

00:27.361 --> 00:28.529
is in a rap song?

00:28.562 --> 00:31.065
- Aunt Brooke's
bags are in a rap song

00:31.099 --> 00:32.666
and you are a Weber
not a von.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.104
- Not yet.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.106
- Bye! Ha!

00:38.139 --> 00:39.407
- You know why grandparents
and grandkids

00:39.440 --> 00:40.508
get along so well?

00:40.541 --> 00:41.342
- Why?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.677
- Because we have
a common enemy.

00:43.711 --> 00:47.415
[theme music]
* Hey yes you know

00:47.448 --> 00:51.152
* I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine *

00:51.185 --> 00:53.287
- She leaves out
her erotica.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.389
I find a trail of stray
ostrich feathers

00:55.423 --> 00:57.325
from her negligÃ©es.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.559
There are pills
everywhere.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.561
It's like a prescription
Lucky Charms spill:

01:00.594 --> 01:01.362
[in Leprechaun accent]
Yellow moons,

01:01.395 --> 01:03.131
green clovers,
blue rhomboids.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.064
- Are you surprised?

01:04.098 --> 01:07.268
Her monogram is one
letter off from CVS.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.670
- She literally does not
leave my house.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.306
She's found a way
to fulfill all her needs

01:12.340 --> 01:13.874
without leaving my couch.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.409
- I aspire to that.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.710
- The only thing
I'm living for is

01:16.744 --> 01:18.546
the two hours of quiet
when she schleps

01:18.579 --> 01:21.182
to Hell's Kitchen for her
private tango lesson

01:21.215 --> 01:22.350
with Ernesto.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.318
- And tonight's
dinner with Ollie!

01:24.352 --> 01:25.253
I'm thinking fondue.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.621
- Yes! I'll drown my
sorrows in gruyere.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.124
- His longevity spa
is really taking off.

01:30.158 --> 01:30.991
- You mean Uth?

01:31.024 --> 01:32.460
- You know it's
pronounced "youth".

01:32.493 --> 01:34.495
- But it's spelled
U-T-H.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.897
Even with the umlaut
it's "uth" to me.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.466
- More like, "uch".

01:38.499 --> 01:40.901
I want to be supportive,
but I refuse to believe

01:40.934 --> 01:42.603
that electroshock
to my cellulite

01:42.636 --> 01:44.738
will give me the
thass of a 25 year old.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.539
- I don't know.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.608
I've read his
chromo-so-much-better

01:47.641 --> 01:49.743
facial does wonders.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.579
- You know that's fancy
for baby dick-tops?

01:51.612 --> 01:52.780
- What?!

01:52.813 --> 01:56.217
- Yeah, Ollie pays hospitals
for infant circumcision flaps.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.918
Then he sends them
to a lab in Long Island City

01:57.951 --> 01:59.420
that extracts the
proteins

01:59.453 --> 02:00.388
and makes them
into a serum.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.455
[gags]

02:01.489 --> 02:03.491
If dabbing foreskin on your
face is so effective,

02:03.524 --> 02:05.193
then why didn't you have

02:05.226 --> 02:05.926
a better complexion
in college?

02:05.959 --> 02:10.264
- Oh! Someone's
feisty today!

02:10.298 --> 02:12.633
Speaking of complexion.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.202
- What's going on?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.669
You never wear
lipstick during the day.

02:15.703 --> 02:19.607
And, no offense, but
you look really nice.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.441
- You're gonna judge.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.342
- Of course I am.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.710
- Graham and I have
gotten a bit rote

02:22.743 --> 02:25.279
in our FaceTimes,
so we decided

02:25.313 --> 02:27.281
to spice it up
and have a date

02:27.315 --> 02:28.616
in a nice restaurant.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.518
- So wait, you're
in the restaurant

02:30.551 --> 02:33.221
and he's Ed Snowden
on an iPad?

02:33.254 --> 02:34.588
- I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.391
- No, it's a Modern Love
column in the making.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.693
Not a good one,
but it'll get printed.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.531
- Since Dot the
Rapper's "Mad Cheddar"

02:43.564 --> 02:45.766
was the official
song of summer,

02:45.799 --> 02:47.201
it's time to get to work.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.502
- I'm so ready for fall.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.271
I had such bad
swimmer's ear.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.672
- I had tennis elbow!

02:51.705 --> 02:54.275
- I had spinner's labia.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.744
It's an old
college injury.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.412
- Huh,
first bit of business-

02:58.446 --> 03:00.281
- Wait, are we all gonna
wait on Stephanie or-

03:00.314 --> 03:02.450
- In light of their
financial situation,

03:02.483 --> 03:04.418
her husband moved
the family

03:04.452 --> 03:06.220
to a kibbutz in Israel.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.655
- I'm pretty sure they're
in a five bedroom

03:07.688 --> 03:10.291
in Scarsdale.
- Same thing.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.359
- And, and

03:11.392 --> 03:12.560
[whispers]
who's this?

03:12.593 --> 03:14.395
- This is
Parker Winchester.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.629
She just moved into
the Krevitt's

03:15.663 --> 03:17.331
old townhouse on Fifth.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.400
- Well, I don't usually
buy discount,

03:19.433 --> 03:20.668
but this was the only place
on the market

03:20.701 --> 03:22.303
with a full-size ballroom.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.837
- Well, I'm--
- Pleased to make

03:23.871 --> 03:24.738
your acquaintance.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.375
- Anyway, in this
continuing compromised

03:27.408 --> 03:30.311
financial climate,
indiscreet indulgence

03:30.344 --> 03:32.446
seems tone deaf.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.448
Von Weber needs to
become synonymous

03:34.482 --> 03:37.385
with something other
than consumption.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.387
So, what is the
opposite of "getting"?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.322
- Wanting.

03:41.355 --> 03:45.025
- Giving. It's the
currency of the South.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.328
Well, that and
passive aggression.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.863
- Giving.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.465
- Brooke, excuse me.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.634
Brooke, which one?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.603
- Orange says criminal
and I do not want you

03:55.636 --> 03:56.737
going to Club Fed.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.838
- Why? You're
the hottest guest

03:57.871 --> 03:59.607
in town afterwards.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.409
Cindy Adams' husband says,

04:01.442 --> 04:04.512
"If you're indicted,
you're invited."

04:04.545 --> 04:06.447
- Can you please
give us the room?

04:08.382 --> 04:10.484
Come here.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.420
- I haven't
dreaded a meeting

04:12.453 --> 04:13.621
this much since the
Dartmouth Disciplinary

04:13.654 --> 04:14.888
Committee hearing.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.325
- And look how
that turned out.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.361
- My family had to gift the
campus a beach club,

04:20.394 --> 04:23.497
complete with lazy river,
so I didn't get expelled.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.800
- Oh. Well,
don't you worry.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.570
You are Lex von Weber

04:29.603 --> 04:31.705
and no matter what
happens today

04:31.739 --> 04:34.442
they can't take that
away from you.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.344
- Thanks, Brooke.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.815
- Go get 'em!

04:47.488 --> 04:48.722
- Would you like
a drink or

04:48.756 --> 04:49.790
would you like to
wait for your guest?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.425
- Oh, uh, he's here-

04:51.459 --> 04:53.827
- Is this like a
Sixth Sense kinda thing?

04:53.861 --> 04:57.365
- It's like a virtual date
kinda thing.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.733
- Hard to split the check
that way, but, okay.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.901
I've got a few
specials today.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.903
I've a
ramp-stuffed chicken

05:02.936 --> 05:04.905
braised to perfection,
very fork-tender.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.542
- Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

05:08.576 --> 05:10.678
- And a hand-caught
smoked trout salad

05:10.711 --> 05:13.881
atop a small-batch
house-fried yam latke.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.416
- Great, I'll have the-

05:15.449 --> 05:17.485
- Couple questions.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.853
Is there dill in
the trout salad?

05:19.887 --> 05:20.921
- There is.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.725
- Can it be made without?

05:24.758 --> 05:25.726
- Sure.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.496
- I'll have the pasta
carbonara and a chiante.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.498
Thanks.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.699
Were you just
screwing with me?

05:31.732 --> 05:32.833
- No, I really wanted to
hear more about

05:32.866 --> 05:36.537
the artisanal ketchup leather
from Circle Jerk farms.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.138
- This reminds me of when

05:38.171 --> 05:40.474
we used to watch
movies in simulcast.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.711
- Aw, during our
residencies.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.913
I would imagine you
wearing nothing

05:45.946 --> 05:48.982
but one of my button downs
and thigh highs.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.117
- Good thing there was no
FaceTime or

05:50.150 --> 05:52.953
you would have seen the
boner-killing reality of me

05:52.986 --> 05:54.455
in sweats and a ratty tee.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.856
[laughs]

05:55.889 --> 05:57.525
- Hey, maybe later you
could invite me up

05:57.558 --> 06:00.394
and we could bump
virtual uglies.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.496
- Hm, well let's see
how dinner goes.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.631
What are you having?

06:03.664 --> 06:05.466
- For starters,
I am having

06:05.499 --> 06:09.737
a plant-based,
hand-forged antidiarrheal.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.738
- Okay.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.947
- The hunter green could be
a bit more saturated

06:19.980 --> 06:23.484
and the gold chord
should pop more.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.553
The colors were right
in one of the test prints

06:25.586 --> 06:28.622
and it was here
this morning.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.858
It's in one of
the groups.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.428
Ugh, sorry.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.002
[frustrated scream]

06:42.035 --> 06:44.572
- Don't mind her, darling.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.808
- Due to the colossal
amount of money

06:47.841 --> 06:50.778
you recklessly invested for
clients at Hercules Capital,

06:50.811 --> 06:53.046
my office had no choice
but to conduct a thorough

06:53.080 --> 06:54.915
forensic accounting
of your firm.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.884
- Ma'am. my client,
Alexander von Weber,

06:56.917 --> 06:58.819
was just as much of a
victim-

06:58.852 --> 07:00.521
- Let me finish, Bob.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.522
We have been trying
to determine if

07:01.555 --> 07:04.658
these partners were
accomplices of Krevitt,

07:04.692 --> 07:06.927
or just spectacularly inept.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.664
After our extensive review,

07:10.698 --> 07:12.766
we concluded Hercules
was guilty of...

07:12.800 --> 07:16.470
profound negligence
on account of

07:16.504 --> 07:19.473
total incompetence.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.742
No charges will be filed,
but both men

07:21.775 --> 07:25.679
are hereby stripped
of their SEC license

07:25.713 --> 07:28.682
to invest in publicly traded
equities for clients.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.817
- What?! No!

07:29.850 --> 07:31.519
- But you just said you
found no criminal activity!

07:31.552 --> 07:32.686
- We can't in good
conscience

07:32.720 --> 07:34.522
let these men handle
other people's money.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.823
- But this was all
his fault.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.090
He's the one
who put everything

07:37.124 --> 07:38.826
we had into
Krevitt's fund!

07:38.859 --> 07:40.828
I didn't even
know about it.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.062
- Because you were
too busy trying to

07:42.095 --> 07:44.698
find yourself
smoking peyote

07:44.732 --> 07:46.066
with a dude
dressed like an owl.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.901
- I'm pretty sure
that was a real owl.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.737
- The complete
dissolution of Hercules

07:49.770 --> 07:52.773
will mean the immediate
liquidation of assets

07:52.806 --> 07:55.543
including the company
ski lodge

07:55.576 --> 07:58.612
complete with the company
rescue St. Bernard

07:58.646 --> 08:00.781
and company whiskey barrel.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.716
- Oh this can't
be happening.

08:02.750 --> 08:06.019
- Oh boo-hoo, now you'll just
have to live off your wife.

08:06.053 --> 08:09.022
- There are two kinds
of people in this world, Wilson.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.826
Wedgie givers,
and wedgie receivers.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.061
And you are
the worst kind.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.663
- What's that?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.931
- Somebody who used to
be a wedgie receiver

08:17.965 --> 08:20.868
but now is
a wedgie giver.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.870
- I don't need to listen
to this shit.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.005
- You're always the
"wait up" guy.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.608
In college it was,
"Where's the party this weekend?

08:27.641 --> 08:28.809
Wait up!
"Hey are you guys

08:28.842 --> 08:31.311
skiing in Stadt this
winter? Wait up!"

08:31.344 --> 08:32.880
- You know,
I got a plane to catch.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.881
I'm gonna go to Florida

08:33.914 --> 08:36.650
to lay low for two
years until I can reboot.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.018
- Florida, perfect!
Tilt the country

08:38.051 --> 08:40.788
and that's where all
the bad eggs roll.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.891
Prick-shaped state
for a dickhole like you.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.994
- Hey babe.

08:47.027 --> 08:47.795
- Where have you been?

08:47.828 --> 08:49.630
I've been texting you
for an hour.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.631
- I was at Hazel's
school for the

08:50.664 --> 08:52.633
Father-Daughter Conflict
Resolution Seminar.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.734
What's up?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.969
- Well, first your mother
trashed one of my prints

08:56.003 --> 08:58.939
by using it as a coaster
for Bordello Yellow.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.641
Next I go into
Hazel's room

09:00.674 --> 09:02.943
and find one of her votives
still burning!

09:02.976 --> 09:04.945
This place could've
been Pompeii.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.046
- What can we do,
hon?

09:06.079 --> 09:08.348
She was wiped out
by Ernie Krevitt.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.017
- Well I'm sick of her
hazardous candles

09:10.050 --> 09:12.653
burning everywhere just
because she wants to be

09:12.686 --> 09:14.722
"bathed in a
warm light".

09:14.755 --> 09:16.089
Miles was doing his
homework by lantern

09:16.123 --> 09:18.091
like Laura Ingalls.

09:18.125 --> 09:18.826
- She'll be
out of the house

09:18.859 --> 09:20.628
at four for her
dance lesson.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.763
Why don't you work at the
library until then?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.065
- [screaming]
Because it's my house!

09:25.098 --> 09:26.199
Candace:
Keep it down, Jill.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.635
You're scaring Jeong.

09:33.340 --> 09:33.741
[Candace giggling]

09:34.507 --> 09:36.176
- Candace!
It's quarter to four.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.111
You're going to be
late for dance.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.280
- Oh no, no.
I'm right on schedule.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.183
In fact Ernesto and I
were just warming up.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.284
- What's he doing here?

09:44.317 --> 09:47.320
I specifically booked the
lessons at the studio.

09:47.354 --> 09:50.691
- But then you wouldn't
be able to see my progress.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.126
If you're going out,
be a dear would you

09:53.160 --> 09:54.628
and pick me up
a few things?

09:54.662 --> 09:56.129
- Like opaque
sleep attire?

09:56.163 --> 09:59.066
- The only thing I sleep
in is Chanel Number 5.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.201
Though I could use
better thread count sheets

10:01.234 --> 10:03.036
in twin size
and a vacuum.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.373
- Why don't you
just use mine?

10:06.406 --> 10:09.710
- Why don't you?

10:09.743 --> 10:13.046
- Okay, If I promise
to get everything

10:13.080 --> 10:14.314
that you're asking for,

10:14.347 --> 10:16.216
can you find a
ribbon of kindness

10:16.249 --> 10:18.318
in that Carrara
marble heart of yours

10:18.351 --> 10:20.353
to grant me
90 minutes alone

10:20.387 --> 10:22.690
in my own apartment?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.324
- I could.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.700
Oh and throw in a little
something for yourself.

10:32.733 --> 10:36.169
Like, maybe a tooth
whitening kit.

10:36.203 --> 10:46.379
[laughs] Love it.
You're so fabulous.

10:46.413 --> 10:50.250
- There, your necessities
will be here within an hour.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.752
I am walking
out the door now.

10:51.785 --> 10:55.288
Watch me so you can
see how that's done.

10:55.322 --> 11:00.127
[Tango music]

11:00.160 --> 11:02.229
- Who has other ideas for
how von Weber

11:02.262 --> 11:05.032
can pay it forward?
Yes Simone.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.367
- My plastic surgeon does a
one for one program.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.468
For every nose job
he does here,

11:08.501 --> 11:10.771
he does one pro
bono in Delaware.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.074
- Noted. What else?

11:14.107 --> 11:16.476
- We could offer manners
classes to liberals!

11:16.509 --> 11:19.212
Maybe their pleas
would be heard

11:19.246 --> 11:20.280
if ends with "please".

11:20.313 --> 11:21.715
[phone rings]

11:21.749 --> 11:23.483
- Ooh, Lex.
Hello?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.753
- It's over.
I'm done.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.454
- What?
What happened?

11:27.487 --> 11:29.823
- Hercules is gone.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.727
- No, only the "cules"
is gone.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.763
The "Her" is right here.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.397
And I'm not going
anywhere.

11:37.430 --> 11:41.301
In fact, I'm going to lean
into my role as provider.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.435
- Thanks, Brookie.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.304
Guess I just needed
to hear your-

11:44.337 --> 11:47.440
Brooke?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.509
- That's it!

11:49.542 --> 11:52.780
Provider. Provider!

11:52.813 --> 11:55.883
ProvideHer.

11:55.916 --> 12:00.287
Von Weber will be
a ProvideHer.

12:00.320 --> 12:05.225
Women don't need a hand out,
they need a hand up.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.260
Give an impoverished
woman a bag

12:07.294 --> 12:09.096
so they have a bag
for a day,

12:09.129 --> 12:11.464
but teach that woman
how to make a bag

12:11.498 --> 12:13.834
well she can eat
forever.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.202
- That's actually called
slave labor.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.270
And I should know.

12:17.304 --> 12:17.905
- Where are there
needy women?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.907
- Uberpool?

12:19.940 --> 12:23.510
- Exactly, but on
a global level.

12:29.817 --> 12:35.322
- Hello? Hello?

12:35.355 --> 12:39.392
Anybody home?

12:39.426 --> 12:49.369
* Amazing grace
How sweet the sound *

12:49.402 --> 12:54.441
[humming]

12:54.474 --> 12:57.177
Candace! What about
our deal?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.846
- I needed to unwind.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.848
- But you're never wound!

13:00.881 --> 13:03.316
- Please close the door
behind you.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.287
Oh, and your "Amazing Grace"
was anything but.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.863
[text message pings]

13:20.868 --> 13:22.335
- In my birth
announcement

13:22.369 --> 13:24.537
I was wearing
a Wharton onesie.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.338
I had gold fish.

13:25.372 --> 13:29.376
I named them
Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.478
And then when
one of them died,

13:31.511 --> 13:34.414
I got another one and I
named him "Bonus."

13:34.447 --> 13:39.920
- Oh, Lex, honey.
I know it's emasculating

13:39.953 --> 13:43.523
and not how traditional
marriages succeed

13:43.556 --> 13:45.525
but know
that you have

13:45.558 --> 13:47.527
the ever- expanding
juggernaut

13:47.560 --> 13:50.931
of my company to
boost you aloft.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.567
And the luxury of the
two most important things,

13:54.601 --> 13:57.204
time and space, huh?

13:57.237 --> 13:59.039
Come on.
Let's go, buddy.

13:59.072 --> 14:02.509
[blows raspberry]
- Time and space.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.051
- I'm still mad at you,
but this is a good start.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.219
- It's actually for
my mother.

14:12.252 --> 14:16.523
- Oh great, Norman Bates.
Mother is in the bath. Again.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.326
- It's for this tactic that
we learned with the dads'

14:19.359 --> 14:21.294
committee to ensure
a free-flowing conversation.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.464
The holder of the Peace Rose
gets to speak.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.665
And so I am going
to talk-

14:25.698 --> 14:27.367
- Jill, honey
I need some-

14:27.400 --> 14:30.070
Where are the
other eleven?

14:30.103 --> 14:34.241
- Mother, I wanted
to say that I hear you,

14:34.274 --> 14:35.442
and I am here for you.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.243
- Anderson, I-

14:36.276 --> 14:37.310
- Ah ah ah!

14:37.344 --> 14:38.511
I know you've fallen
on hard times

14:38.545 --> 14:39.947
with that lousy investment.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.049
And we will help you
for as long as you need,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.051
because that's what
family does. But-

14:44.084 --> 14:45.652
- Give me that
and stop talking to me

14:45.685 --> 14:48.255
like I'm shaking a cup
on the corner.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.490
Do you really think I'd be as
stupid as your brother

14:50.523 --> 14:52.960
to sock away all my duckets
with Ernie Krevitt?

14:52.993 --> 14:56.296
No! I was diversified and

14:56.329 --> 14:59.432
I only lost
a fifth of my fortune.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.269
- What?

15:02.302 --> 15:05.072
- Oh yeah well the truth is
I had a sexual dalliance

15:05.105 --> 15:06.974
with Ernie last summer
and I need a place to lay low

15:07.007 --> 15:08.508
until this blows over.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.643
Page Six would have a
field day with a

15:10.677 --> 15:13.313
May-December romance
like this.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.415
- You mean
Christmas-Boxing Day.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.449
At best.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.951
- So, I came to the place
where I knew no one

15:17.985 --> 15:20.954
would come
looking for me.

15:20.988 --> 15:27.995
[shrieks]
[energetic rock music]

15:28.028 --> 15:29.329
[door slams]

15:34.201 --> 15:34.901
- Ollie, you are a
full-on fetus.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.271
I thought it was just
an ancient profile picture

15:38.305 --> 15:40.107
but you actually
look like this.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.109
- Go on, feast your eyes.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.143
- Isn't it insane?

15:43.176 --> 15:45.378
He looks exactly the same
as when we graduated

15:45.412 --> 15:47.347
minus the
eyebrow piercing.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.150
- I can't be launching
med spas looking my age.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.086
Ooh. I have swag
for you.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.156
- Woo-hoo!

15:56.189 --> 15:59.459
- Oh they're awesome!
Thank you.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.260
Ow!

16:00.293 --> 16:03.330
Jill, any monster-in-
law updates?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.364
- Ugh, I don't want to
discuss it.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.766
I've been looking forward
to this meal all day

16:06.799 --> 16:09.269
and I don't want to get
indigestion before I eat.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.138
- How long has she
been living with you?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.505
- Five hundred
twenty-five thousand

16:12.539 --> 16:13.706
six hundred migraines.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.108
- Oh, Jilly.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.376
- And she's not even broke!

16:16.409 --> 16:17.244
I can't take it anymore!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.279
She's always in my face,
telling me

16:19.312 --> 16:22.082
I dress like
a Sicilian widow.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.784
I am one step closer to being
committed every hour.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.753
- You need one of those
Dr. Evil buttons.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.788
Press it and she gets
sucked down a chute.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.522
- Great idea.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.324
Can I Prime Now
one of those?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.193
- You could serve her a
Chicago Waffle.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.127
- What's that?

16:34.161 --> 16:36.163
- It's when you take a
dump on the keyboard

16:36.196 --> 16:39.432
of someone's laptop and
then you shut the screen.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.567
- That's perfect.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.135
I can blame it
on Miles.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.136
- Ew! Why do you
even know that?

16:43.170 --> 16:45.138
- One of the phlebotomists
was dating two RNs

16:45.172 --> 16:46.439
at the same time.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.275
Two-timing a professional
that comfortable with

16:48.308 --> 16:50.443
bodily fluids is a
dangerous game.

16:50.477 --> 16:54.047
- Well, two girls
one laptop aside,

16:54.081 --> 16:56.783
Candace doesn't even
have a computer.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.451
- Since you can't change the
fact that she's living with you,

16:58.485 --> 17:00.320
why not change
your attitude about it?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.055
- Go back to LA
if you're going to

17:02.089 --> 17:03.323
bring that kind of
mindfulness around here.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.058
- I'm serious.
There's this new high-

17:05.092 --> 17:08.061
intensity meditation
app called, Medi-8.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.529
For people who want to
achieve a higher state

17:09.562 --> 17:11.298
of consciousness in
under 10 minutes.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.366
- No offense, but I am
way past that

17:13.400 --> 17:16.169
zen bullshit.
I am going nuts!

17:16.203 --> 17:18.338
She literally won't
leave my house!

17:18.371 --> 17:20.073
- You need to get her
on jury duty.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.074
- Yes.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.342
- Now you're talking.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.344
- We must know someone
in the DA's office.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.612
- We don't have to.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.148
Apparently there's a
24 hour hotline

17:28.181 --> 17:29.549
you can call to volunteer.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.384
- Okay, that is genius.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.819
Can you imagine?

17:32.852 --> 17:35.355
Oooh bubbling
cheese cauldron, yum!

17:35.388 --> 17:36.423
[iPad rings]

17:36.456 --> 17:39.226
- Jesus, doesn't he
have cleft palettes to mend?

17:39.259 --> 17:42.195
- Hey Babe,
I just wanted to say

17:42.229 --> 17:44.831
goodnight and that
until tomorrow,

17:44.864 --> 17:46.833
I'm keeping you right
in this pocket,

17:46.866 --> 17:48.435
over my heart.

17:48.468 --> 17:52.339
- Love you.
Thanks for calling.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.307
- Don't actually put your
mouth on that thing.

17:54.341 --> 17:57.177
Screens are dirtier
than most public toilets.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.411
- Yuck.
Goodnight.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.516
- You do know that "Her"
is a cautionary tale, right?

18:03.550 --> 18:06.085
- Jill, let me live!

18:08.288 --> 18:12.392
[heavy typing sound]

18:12.425 --> 18:14.494
- Wow. You're really working
hard over there.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.829
- It's stuff for
Hazel's school.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.431
Doing the seating chart for
our wedding was easier

18:18.465 --> 18:21.268
than locking in a date for
Dads' Night Out.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.636
- Wait...you're making all
that thunderous

18:23.670 --> 18:25.872
clickity-clacking and
it's not even for work?

18:25.905 --> 18:30.610
[heavy typing
sound continues]

18:30.643 --> 18:33.146
- I mean it like there's lead
in your fingertips.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.581
When I type
it's silent,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.349
like a courtroom
stenographer.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.417
- I'm almost done.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.585
Just another
half-hour or so.

18:48.295 --> 18:53.433
[meditation guide's voice]
- Weightlessness. Love.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.536
Acceptance.
Let down the guard that

18:56.569 --> 19:00.707
constipates your soul and feel
the chi flow through you-

19:00.740 --> 19:03.176
- Oh Jesus Christ.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.678
I can't take this steaming
pile of horse shit.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.646
I'm getting snackage.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.485
- Dear Jacob, I hope sixth
grade is going great so far.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.887
Do the leaves change
in Florida?

19:14.921 --> 19:17.524
I'm trying to
convince my mom

19:17.557 --> 19:19.192
to let me get Instagram
for Hanukkah.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.593
I'll send you my account
when I have it.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.463
- Perfect.
Now if you want it to be

19:23.496 --> 19:26.333
more personal, shall we
seal it with a kiss?

19:26.366 --> 19:28.201
[Hazel giggles]
- Okay.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.970
- Put on my lipstick.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.507
You got it?
- Mm-hm.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.475
- Now press your
lips on the back,

19:35.508 --> 19:37.244
but don't actually kiss it
with pursed lips

19:37.277 --> 19:39.612
or it'll look like
psoriasis.

19:39.646 --> 19:43.383
Just press it once.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.918
Let's see?

19:45.952 --> 19:50.657
Lovely, he'll die.
[giggles]

19:57.397 --> 20:00.333
[iPad rings]

20:00.367 --> 20:01.634
- Couldn't stop thinking
about me?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.536
[moans of pleasure]

20:03.570 --> 20:07.240
Graham: Oh yeah. That's-
Woman: Graham!

20:12.945 --> 20:13.780
- Hazel, has anyone
ever talked to you

20:15.415 --> 20:17.016
about the birds
and the bees?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.985
- Yeah of course.
My mom told me where

20:19.018 --> 20:20.787
babies come from
ages ago.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.722
- Did she tell you where
pleasure comes from?

20:22.755 --> 20:24.023
- Huh?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.358
- As I suspected,
she focused more on the

20:25.392 --> 20:28.027
peas and not the steak.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.697
Your pleasure is the most
important part of intimacy.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.334
Not his, not hers, should
your boat float left,

20:34.367 --> 20:35.435
but yours.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.404
- I don't know what you're
talking about, Candace.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.272
- I'm talking about
understanding

20:39.306 --> 20:42.309
the botany of your
feminine flower.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.643
- What flower?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.011
- It's time for you to get
acquainted with

20:45.044 --> 20:47.814
the different parts and
functions of your vulva.

20:47.847 --> 20:48.948
I'll teach you.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.751
- Hello, this is
Candace von Weber.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.887
I'd like to make a reservation
for Jury Duty.

21:00.660 --> 21:05.898
- Oh no.
Oh no, no, no.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.635
I FaceTimed Vanessa
by accident.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.338
[speaking Kurundi]
Vanessa!

21:11.371 --> 21:13.873
- I told you about her.

21:13.906 --> 21:18.945
[angrily speaking Kurundi]
Vanessa!

21:18.978 --> 21:23.049
- Baby, don't be like that.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.083
