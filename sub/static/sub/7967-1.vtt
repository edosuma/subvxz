02:07.360 --> 02:09.351
Oh, God.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.798
Be seated.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.438
We're gathered here to witness and bless

03:18.520 --> 03:26.029
the joining together for ever of William
and Josephina in Christian marriage.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.315
The firm covenant of marriage
is permanent in this lifetime,

03:31.400 --> 03:34.119
because it was established by God.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.919
And once entered into,
it may never be broken

03:37.000 --> 03:41.152
without risk of eternal damnation.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.835
So I ask you now, in the presence
of God, family and friends,

03:44.920 --> 03:50.517
to declare your intentions to enter
a permanent union with one another

03:50.600 --> 03:55.469
for as long as you both
shall draw breath on this earth.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.196
- Josephina.
- Jo!

04:00.280 --> 04:02.396
Jesus Christ. Jojo!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.831
- Hey, look out.
- Think I got eyes in my butt?

04:07.920 --> 04:10.388
That's where your brains are.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.869
- Daisy!
- Yeah.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.791
Think we might get that pizza served
while it's still hot?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.075
I think maybe.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.911
Mr Lopes left his teeth again.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.155
I need a coffee cup, Manny.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.836
Jesus Christ! These shoes are killing me.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.911
Corns at 20. Can you believe it?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.991
Come on. Do you have to talk that way?

05:01.360 --> 05:04.477
- Yeah, Dais. Watch your mouth.
- Oh, excuse me, Holy Mother.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.155
What I meant to say was,
these fucking shoes are killing me.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.708
Put a lid on it, Daisy.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.791
Thank you.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.311
Tourists!

05:24.800 --> 05:28.031
Excuse me. May I have my coffee now?

05:32.920 --> 05:35.115
Jo, what are you doing here?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.077
I am getting out of that house.

05:37.160 --> 05:42.234
My father just put himself 5,000 bucks in
the hole to watch his daughter pass out.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.471
- He is just a little pissed off.
- I thought it was pretty funny.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.994
- Daisy...! Hey, Jo.
- Hi.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.674
Well, it was a first for St Mary's, anyway.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.830
I saw myself ten years from now.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.276
Fat and ugly, and all these kids
swarming around me,

05:56.360 --> 05:59.238
and then I was picking
fish scales out of Bill's boot.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.833
Sounds about on target.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.992
- But I did do the right thing, didn't l?
- Sure.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.311
Jo, the only reason to get married
is to get the hell out of Mystic.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.551
- How's Bill taking it?
- He's still not talking to me.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.791
- Get ready to talk, Jo.
- Hey, check it out.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.995
- Only kidding, man.
- Shut up, you asshole!

06:25.080 --> 06:27.753
Come on, Bill.
Let's go outside and talk, OK?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.631
Please. Bill, please.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.792
I wanna talk to you. Let's just go outside.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.836
Dirtbag.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.951
- So what happened, Jo?
- I don't know.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.429
I just, you know...

06:56.520 --> 07:00.035
I just... When I actually
got up there to do it,

07:00.120 --> 07:02.714
I just couldn't, Bill. I just couldn't.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.317
Bill, it's not that I don't love you.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.959
Because I do, Bill.
I really, really, really do.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.269
You know, I walk into this place,
and everybody stares at me.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.954
Let 'em stare.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.990
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.355
- And everything's better now?
- Yeah.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.758
So how does November 21st sound?

07:53.720 --> 07:57.508
I don't know. Let's just talk about it later.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.718
- Kiss Mom for me.
- No. I'll be late for my interview.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.793
- Well, then you better hurry.
- I've been three times this week already.

08:06.880 --> 08:10.759
Well, Kat... four, and you go to heaven.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.955
"Kat's such a good girl."

08:16.040 --> 08:18.713
"Where did we go wrong
with her sister Daisy?"

08:20.320 --> 08:23.517
Honey, you'd do just fine
if you just used your head a little more.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.511
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.275
I'm not gonna be slingin' pizza
for the rest of my life.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.271
The best pizza.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.750
Hey, Ma. Sausage today.

09:08.840 --> 09:13.595
Oh, great! Ladies, we're gonna eat
soon as we finish this tote.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.989
Hey, Kat. Come on, sit down. Have some.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.594
No, I gotta go.
I got an interview out on Shore Road.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.989
- Another job?
- Yeah, baby-sitting.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.992
You do too much.
Kat's got four jobs already.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.789
- I need the money.
- Kat's been accepted to Yale University.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.599
She got a scholarship
and she's startin' in February.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.750
A part-scholarship.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.831
So you got a boyfriend yet?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.310
Got no time for boys.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.311
Kat, I got a great idea.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.392
Hey, Silvio! You got a job
for my smart kid?

09:45.280 --> 09:49.398
- Terrific, Ma. Bye.
- Bye, honey. Thanks for the pizza.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.792
Where does she get her energy?
All those jobs, and a straight-A student...

10:23.920 --> 10:26.593
- Hello?
- Come on in.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.029
- Katherine?
- Kat.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.196
Hi. Tim Travers.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.271
My daughter did the decorating.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.675
Phoebe, come on down, sweetheart.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.433
Oh, wow! An old Van Cort.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.318
Oh, yeah. I guess it came with the house.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.359
- Are you into stargazing?
- Actually, this is a nautical telescope.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.113
But it's a lot better
than the one I have at home.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.590
- I'm going to take astronomy at college.
- Yeah? What college?

10:57.680 --> 10:59.875
Yale. I start second semester.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.794
Yale, huh? Me, too. Class of '79.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.515
And this beautiful redhead is Phoebe.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.790
Phoebe, this is Kat.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.634
Hi, Phoebe.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.631
How old are you, Phoebe?

11:21.600 --> 11:24.751
- Come on. You know how old you are.
- Six.

11:24.840 --> 11:29.755
Four. Forgive her. She's had a hard week.
Her mother left for England yesterday.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.229
What I'm looking for
is someone to help me out.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.880
Not full time, just until my wife gets back.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.151
Excuse me.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.271
OK, come on, sweetheart.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.634
Hello?

11:43.720 --> 11:45.711
Yeah. Hi, Mrs Farley.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.635
Oh, we got off
to a good start this morning.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.872
Yeah, we knocked down
that wall heading into the...

11:51.960 --> 11:54.235
Glass brick?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.074
Yeah, well...

11:56.160 --> 12:00.392
I like glass brick too, Mrs Farley,
but it doesn't go with your house.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.748
But...

12:04.200 --> 12:09.593
But we've had long talks about staying in
the tradition of the Connecticut house.

12:09.680 --> 12:13.559
- Of course I'll talk to your decorator.
- Do you want to read this with me?

12:13.640 --> 12:16.154
It's time to turn the page, though.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.231
Do you want to turn the page here?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.991
OK. Here we go.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.516
"She was quite the loveliest fairy
in the whole world."

12:24.600 --> 12:28.559
"Her dress was like golden dewdrops,
and there were flowers in her hair."

12:28.640 --> 12:31.677
"And her face was like
the most perfect flower of all."

12:31.760 --> 12:35.514
"She came close to the little rabbit
and kissed him on his velvet nose..."

12:35.600 --> 12:38.876
Well, you certainly
seem to have the touch.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.554
I've been baby-sitting since I was nine.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.313
- I'm nine.
- No, you're not. Do you drive, Kat?

12:44.400 --> 12:46.311
Yeah.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.834
Is there a history of insanity in the family?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.956
They say it skips a generation.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.713
- When can you start?
- Anytime.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.870
Read.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.431
Read.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.678
"'Little rabbit, don't you know who I am?"'

13:26.280 --> 13:29.238
I smell like a couple of buckets of fish.
What you got in there?

13:29.320 --> 13:31.675
- A couple of buckets of fish.
- Terrific.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.433
It's Romeo and Juli-e-et!

13:34.520 --> 13:37.671
- Those boys talkin' to me?
- No, I don't think they is.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.751
- Oh, boy. Uh-oh.
- What?

13:41.320 --> 13:44.278
Come on, Bill. Let's just drink,
and beat 'em up later.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.436
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Daisy.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.511
- Who's buyin'?
- I'll buy.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.591
- Winning any?
- No.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.875
- Got a smoke for me, Jo?
- Yeah.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.240
- OK, what do you want to drink?
- White wine?

14:17.880 --> 14:19.632
I'll have white wine too, please.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.756
- George?
- Lite.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.673
Can I get two white wines,
two beers, and one of 'em lite?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.472
Dais?

14:27.560 --> 14:29.551
Oh, he is cute.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.955
Yeah, if you like white bread.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.631
Rich white bread.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.831
Ladies? Here you go.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.999
For you.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.117
Look at that punk. I would look
good in a coat like that, huh?

14:45.880 --> 14:48.189
OK, let's get some action goin', huh?

14:57.280 --> 15:00.192
Ten bucks says
I get three bull's-eyes in a row.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.075
Make it fifty.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.879
And, between throws, off a shot of tequila.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.675
- Three tequilas.
- This guy's nuts.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.751
Yeah.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.915
He said that he could hit three
in the bull's-eye. Can you do that?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.468
I can do the three shots of tequila.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.551
George.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.554
Three in a row.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.631
Starting now.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.629
No way.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.157
All right, I'll take that fifty.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.991
Yes, sir! Thank you.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.550
Let's play some pool.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.710
It's not that I don't like playing pool.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.598
- But why can't we do it at my house?
- Lorna?

16:40.680 --> 16:42.671
No! I'm the worst. Really.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.675
Excuse me.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.830
Do you play?

16:58.320 --> 17:00.675
Sure.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.910
OK. Why don't you break 'em?

17:42.200 --> 17:44.191
Sorry, partner.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.919
OK. It's our turn, sweetheart.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.311
Right, here's what we want.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.916
Right down here, honey.
The one with the orange stripe.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.959
Right on the orange, nice and easy.
Just send it right down there.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.391
Darn.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.712
Well, take it easy, honey. That's why
we play boy-girl. To even things out.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.231
Excuse me.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.109
I think we got a ringer here.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.788
She is really good at this.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.508
I know what you are. A hustler.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.750
Lorna!

19:15.120 --> 19:18.908
Isn't that the right word, Charlie?
Like in that pool-hall movie.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.436
Fast game.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.511
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.075
- Quite a game.
- Anytime.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.234
Can we get out of here? Please?

19:59.640 --> 20:01.631
Shit.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.874
- Daisy?
- Hi, Mom.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.678
You going to 11 o'clock mass?

20:17.440 --> 20:20.750
No. I went last night.

20:22.800 --> 20:27.555
I got to get lunch ready. Uncle Vic
and Aunt Rosalie are coming' over.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.915
Daisy? You help me with lunch.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.594
- Kat will.
- Thanks a lot.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.996
She gone?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.519
Do you like it?

20:44.160 --> 20:46.390
160 bucks? Are you out of your mind?

20:46.480 --> 20:48.471
I'm going to return it

20:49.360 --> 20:51.351
after I've worn it...

20:52.960 --> 20:54.951
somewhere.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.511
Daisy?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.955
Wait up, Phoebe.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.951
- Daddy!
- Hi, sweetheart.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.278
- How was the story hour?
- I got a library card.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.797
- That's great. What'd you get?
- I got The Yellow House

21:23.880 --> 21:27.316
and Barbra's Little Girl.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.832
- She picked them herself.
- I'll bet. Are you hungry, Phoebes?

21:30.920 --> 21:31.989
- Yes.
- OK.

21:32.080 --> 21:37.279
One baloney and cheese on white,
no crust, coming right up.

21:37.920 --> 21:43.278
OK. Now, why don't you take your books
and your sandwich out on the porch?

21:43.360 --> 21:46.557
- And you know the rule, right?
- Don't get off the porch.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.710
I'll be right out.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.351
Later, alligator.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.029
This should keep us up to date, Kat.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.513
- There you go.
- Thank you.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.520
I always wondered what
the inside looked like.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.751
It's going to look a hell of a lot
better than this, I promise you.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.071
- I'm impressed already.
- You want to see the best part?

22:11.160 --> 22:13.913
- Yeah.
- OK. Phoebe?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.956
- What?
- I'm going' upstairs, OK?

22:16.040 --> 22:18.031
- OK.
- Don't go out the porch.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.791
- Wow! This place is huge.
- Not bad for a summer cottage.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.633
Actually, the original house
was built in 1880

22:25.720 --> 22:29.918
by a wealthy merchant named Elias
Montrose for his English bride, Elizabeth.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.991
Watch your step.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.516
They were married in London
after a whirlwind romance.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.595
It's gorgeous.

22:40.080 --> 22:44.551
What a view!
Oh, I'd put a telescope right out here.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.989
This is where Elias would watch his ships
come in and unload their treasures.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.959
- Like what?
- Teas and spices from Ceylon.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.952
Silks, pearls, sapphires from India.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.555
I thought the only things that came
through Mystic were lobster and cod.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.155
The story has a sad ending.
Elias returned to Mystic

23:03.240 --> 23:06.357
and Elizabeth stayed in London
to settle her affairs.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.193
On her way here, her ship was lost at sea.

23:09.280 --> 23:13.592
And old Elias spent all the rest
of the days of his life

23:13.680 --> 23:16.148
watching for her ship.

23:16.240 --> 23:21.553
They say you can still hear his ghost
walking on this balcony on stormy nights.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.634
Of course, it could be this squeaky board.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.075
Are you going to fix it?

23:34.280 --> 23:36.396
Wouldn't dare.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.831
There she is. That was going to be
my wedding present from Bill.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.795
It used to be called the Rose,
after his mom.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.394
The man is a prince, Jo.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.829
Miller Late. I take it back - the man's a god.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.559
Dais, he keeps that there
for him and the guys.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.428
- Dais, he's not going to like that.
- Juju, relax! Trust me.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.229
You're going to wiggle your sweet ass,
and he's going to forget all about it.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.029
- St Katherine with a beer?
- I drink when I want.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.759
You're a real lush.
You screw ten guys a weekend, too.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.798
- No, that's your department.
- You're damn straight it is.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.236
This is very pleasant, OK?
Let's have some fun tonight, OK?

24:19.960 --> 24:24.750
Gosh, you know what I wish? I wish
Bill did not have such a gorgeous body.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.831
- Yeah, right!
- No, I mean it.

24:26.920 --> 24:31.630
It would make things so much easier.
I wouldn't think about him all the time.

24:31.720 --> 24:37.511
Gosh, you know something? I get really
turned on just looking at his wrists.

24:38.040 --> 24:42.511
- His wrists?
- Yes. They're so thick and strong.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.558
- Maybe something's the matter with me.
- I think so.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.915
- I think it's called being in love.
- Oh, no.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.913
- Are you saying I should married him?
- No, she's not.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.514
Kat, look. There's a comet. Right there.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.277
- No, that's just a shooting star.
- It's thrilling.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.190
A comet looks like a tadpole. It's got
a round head and a long blazing tail.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.078
I know what one looks like.

25:07.160 --> 25:12.109
A sperm. A big sperm.
She's got one on the ceiling.

25:12.200 --> 25:17.558
She goes to sleep every night
with a giant sperm flying over her head.

25:17.960 --> 25:21.839
You know what? Ten years from now,
she's going to be a famous astrologer.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.151
- Who are you going to be, Daisy?
- It's "astronomer".

25:25.880 --> 25:29.270
How the hell do I know where I'll be?
I could be dead for all I know.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.794
Daisy! That's bad luck.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.709
- Look, Jo, you've got Bill.
- Right.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.519
You've apparently got brains.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.036
All I've got is this, and these.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.234
- So to hell with both of you.
- No. I don't think so.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.669
- Come back here, Daisy.
- Daisy! Wait up.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.636
I really like old houses
like this, Mrs. Abuja.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.031
I'm sorry.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.514
My family lives in an old house, too.

26:14.480 --> 26:19.156
The water pipes, they burst just about
every winter. My dad gets really pissed.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.599
Well, he gets very upset.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.873
Oh, there you are. You didn't tell me
you were going' out for dinner.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.790
- I didn't know I was.
- Well, you could stay here for dinner.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.713
- I got some nice lost...
- No, thanks, Ma.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.520
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Abuja.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.273
You don't have to come home so late.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.749
I know how long it takes to have dinner.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.196
Daisy

26:59.280 --> 27:01.077
Abuja...

27:01.400 --> 27:04.039
You are a very difficult woman to find.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.873
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.996
Charlie...?

27:11.240 --> 27:14.437
Charles Gordon Windsor. Junior.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.275
Figures.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.673
- Can I get you something?
- No, thanks.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.149
But I think your mother could use a drink.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.351
Shut up.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.596
Sit.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.508
I'll be right with you.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.880
So, get out the spare.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.556
That...

28:22.320 --> 28:24.311
That was the spare.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.071
Yes, that's going to do it.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.271
OK, I got the idea.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.071
Yes!

29:40.680 --> 29:44.878
So tell me, Junior, how come
you're not at your lvy League school,

29:46.280 --> 29:49.352
picking ivy, or whatever you do there?

29:49.440 --> 29:52.352
Why do that,
when I could be here with you?

29:55.560 --> 29:58.313
I needed a little vacation from law school.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.516
Oh.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.319
In other words, you're being a bum.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.354
Exactly.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.874
I got nothing' against bums.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.637
Excuse me, Mr. Windsor.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.480
I hope you and the young lady
enjoyed your dinners.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.551
It was wonderful.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.311
Thank you, sir.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.355
Which one is yours?

30:45.440 --> 30:49.319
My dad's is the 62-foot
two-misted schooner there.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.631
Not bad.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.151
Abuja.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.112
The stars have been,
and still are, used by sailors

31:22.200 --> 31:24.634
to help them determine
their positions at sea.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.314
Remember now, there are
no roads or signposts

31:27.400 --> 31:29.914
or gas stations
where you can ask for directions.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.910
Hi, Kat.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.598
Now we'll show what it's like
to toss around at sea

31:39.680 --> 31:42.353
with the stars your only hope
of getting back home.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.351
How would you find your way?

31:44.440 --> 31:48.069
If you had made a study of the skies,
as ancient seafarers did,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.799
you would realize that
at a given date and time,

31:50.880 --> 31:53.269
each star marks a particular point in the...

31:56.720 --> 31:58.711
A particular...

32:00.200 --> 32:02.236
A particular point in the sky.

32:03.080 --> 32:07.835
So what you would do is measure
each point, each star, with a sextant.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.914
- Hi.
- Hi. You were great.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.992
- I kind of flubbed it today.
- No, no. We both loved it.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.197
- Didn't we, Phoebe?
- Mommy, can we please go home?

32:20.360 --> 32:22.351
It's nap time.

32:34.840 --> 32:36.990
Can you change me, Kat?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.310
Totallin' up?

32:41.400 --> 32:43.516
We're gonna have to do better than this.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.795
Oh, come on, Leona. It'll pick up.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.509
Yeah, in June, with the tourists.
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.955
Absolutely.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.270
Hey, Leona, your boyfriend's on.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.750
Hector Pleshette here
with this week's gastronomic report.

32:58.120 --> 33:01.317
In New Haven, a place called Nubby's.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.675
"Grubby's" would be a better name for it.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.514
I had to ask three times
before I received a clean fork.

33:07.600 --> 33:11.798
Black angel hair pasta
with Dalmatian sauce.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.077
Don't ask me what it is. Just don't try it.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.551
A culinary disaster.
Overpriced and pretentious.

33:18.960 --> 33:23.192
We should get him to come here. A good
review would bring in tons of people.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.511
- I wouldn't let that moron in the door.
- Why not?

33:26.600 --> 33:28.989
I bet if we had designer pizza...

33:30.160 --> 33:33.152
- lt'd taste like that magazine there.
- Oh, come on, Leona.

33:33.240 --> 33:37.552
A little dry white wine, some
smoked clams, sun-dried tomatoes...

33:37.640 --> 33:40.632
- I think we should do it, Leona.
- Listen, young ladies.

33:40.720 --> 33:44.315
We have the real thing right here.
The Mystic Pizza.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.994
Spices from the Algarve back in Portugal.

33:47.080 --> 33:51.870
My grandfather taught my father
how to make it. And my father taught me.

33:51.960 --> 33:55.589
And one of these days, when I retire,
I just might teach one of you.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.193
It's tradition. And you

33:57.280 --> 33:59.475
don't monkey with tradition!

33:59.560 --> 34:02.358
- Amen.
- Leona?

34:02.440 --> 34:04.829
Will you please tell us what's in the pizza?

34:05.960 --> 34:07.393
Please, Leona.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.516
..goat cheese popovers I would kill for.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.716
It ain't goat cheese, I'll tell you that.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.991
There you go. Hop into bed.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.353
Mommy brushes my hair.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.431
Hold still.

34:38.120 --> 34:41.476
- Mommy lives in England now.
- Oh, no, she doesn't.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.358
She's just there working.
She'll be home in a few weeks.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.431
I know.

34:47.239 --> 34:49.231
We're not getting a divorce.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.199
- Well, of course not.
- OK.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.829
Time for bed.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.911
Good night.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.676
All righty. Scootch in.
I'll read you to sleep.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.354
God knows where
she picks these things up.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.433
- Read!
- All righty. I hear and obey, master.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.276
What story do you want?

35:17.360 --> 35:20.716
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night, Kat.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.080
All righty, sweetheart.
What have we here?

35:24.160 --> 35:26.151
Go ahead. Turn the page.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.471
"Uncle Wiggly Learns to Dance."

35:35.440 --> 35:37.396
Kat?

35:39.840 --> 35:41.831
Here.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.832
Better take this. It's gotten chilly out.

35:54.360 --> 35:58.273
- Daddy!
- Be right there.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.871
I'd better go.

36:04.040 --> 36:06.508
Coming, master.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.152
Each room is more
breathtaking than the next.

37:12.240 --> 37:17.598
The dining room table seats 45,
and weighs a whopping 4,000 pounds.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.319
It's the world's only
marble-top extension table.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.358
It took 15 craftsmen a year to build.

37:23.440 --> 37:28.434
If you're wondering if this is the ultimate
fairy-tale home, check out the bedroom...

37:28.520 --> 37:30.397
Hi, Kat.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.674
Mrs Post's daughter,
the privileged princess,

37:33.760 --> 37:36.957
awoke to flowers on the walls,
on the silver door hinges,

37:37.040 --> 37:39.031
even on the four-poster bed.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.270
"Lifestyles " is proud to bring you

37:41.360 --> 37:45.319
this once-in-a-lifetime look
at America 's number one home.

37:45.400 --> 37:49.279
- I can relate.
- Over lunch on the patio...

37:55.640 --> 37:57.631
Nice sweater.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.791
- Kat?
- Good night.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.873
- Whose sweater?
- Tim's.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.389
Tim's?

38:15.160 --> 38:17.435
- So it's "Tim" now?
- Shut up.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.112
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.078
Daisy, I'm his baby-sitter,
and it got chilly tonight.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.674
And he's married.

38:28.760 --> 38:32.036
If he weren't married,
he wouldn't need a baby-sitter.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.078
Looks to me like
he's puttin' the moves on you.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.515
- You're disgusting.
- OK.

38:37.800 --> 38:41.395
I'm disgusting. But just in case...

38:57.000 --> 38:59.070
The guy wears 'em.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.232
Daisy...!

39:06.800 --> 39:08.916
Jojo!

39:13.440 --> 39:16.432
Where is she? Kat, have you seen Jojo?

39:31.680 --> 39:33.477
Just a minute.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.551
Hi.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.991
Hi.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.031
Sorry, Leona.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.990
Hey, Kat. Table six wants dessert.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.395
Ah, I'd love to stay and chat.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.439
- Here you go.
- Miss, this pizza is unbelievable.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.193
- Thank you.
- What is in that sauce?

40:04.280 --> 40:06.350
Oh, I'm sorry. That's top secret.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.995
She won't even tell us what's in it.

40:11.480 --> 40:12.879
Here you go.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.520
Hey, Jo, can you switch days off with me?

40:15.600 --> 40:19.115
- I guess so. Why? What's up?
- Tim needs me on Friday.

40:19.200 --> 40:22.795
Don't do it, Jo. You'll be contributing
to the downfall of a saint.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.919
Butt out, will you? Let's talk
about the preppy with the Porsche.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.630
Holy shit!

40:47.720 --> 40:49.711
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.751
Come on. Let's go.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.836
Daisy.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.271
Make yourself comfortable.

41:26.160 --> 41:29.550
What's the matter?
Can't afford to pay your light bill?

41:29.640 --> 41:32.916
My father turns off all the power
when nobody's here.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.195
- You're here.
- Yeah...

41:37.440 --> 41:39.510
But he doesn't wanna be reminded.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.195
Is it OK to sit on the sofa?

41:47.280 --> 41:49.430
You can do anything you want on it.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.150
It must get kinda lonely here.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.275
I kinda like it this time of year.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.430
No one's around.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.715
It's nice and quiet.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.708
Is this a habit with you?

42:21.800 --> 42:26.032
Picking up townies and luring them
to your big, fancy house?

42:27.760 --> 42:30.149
You're the first.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.910
So how is it?

42:33.000 --> 42:36.629
So far... it's pretty nice.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.071
And for you?

42:46.040 --> 42:48.315
Dais?

43:03.160 --> 43:05.879
Charlie? Follow the breadcrumbs.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.755
This is my parents' room.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.831
I figured.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.030
Is that my father's shirt?

44:08.120 --> 44:10.111
D'you think he'll miss it?

44:11.560 --> 44:13.551
No.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.669
Hey, Junior.

44:18.760 --> 44:21.797
Yeah... Arujo?

44:56.000 --> 44:57.991
Dais.

45:01.720 --> 45:05.315
I told you I was taking'
a vacation from law school.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.634
Yeah?

45:09.720 --> 45:11.915
I was thrown out.

45:13.160 --> 45:15.276
I cheated on a final.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.475
Why?

45:19.560 --> 45:21.551
I panicked.

45:21.640 --> 45:24.359
I was flunking a course, and I panicked.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.799
People flunk courses.
It happens all the time.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.871
But not to me.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.191
Not to Chuck Windsor's son.

45:40.040 --> 45:42.031
You shouldn't have lied.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.515
But I'm glad you told me.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.318
Don't do it again.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.674
Which? Cheat or lie?

45:57.040 --> 45:59.076
Either.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.718
- Hi, Kat.
- How was the poker game?

46:30.800 --> 46:33.189
Great. I won a buck more than I owe you.

46:33.720 --> 46:37.235
- I just checked on Phoebe.
- How is she?

46:37.320 --> 46:40.153
Fine. I hope you don't mind
my using the telescope.

46:40.240 --> 46:42.993
No, no. I'm delighted
to have someone use the thing.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.231
You want a soda or some juice?

46:54.760 --> 46:57.069
I'll have some wine.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.756
- What's up there, anyway?
- Well, have a look.

47:17.840 --> 47:21.992
I see kind of a... fuzzy clump.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.233
That's Pleiades, the Seven Sisters.

47:25.320 --> 47:28.118
Do you see six bright stars
and one very faint one?

47:29.560 --> 47:30.675
Yeah.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.752
That's actually a cluster
of several hundred stars.

47:33.840 --> 47:38.038
Only those few are visible from here.
They're over 400 light years from Earth.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.111
They're a sign of fall.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.996
Am I babbling?

47:44.080 --> 47:46.196
Yeah.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.838
No...

47:47.920 --> 47:49.911
I mean, I like it.

47:51.080 --> 47:53.310
OK, then, I'll tell you one more thing.

47:53.400 --> 47:55.470
It's a great night to spot comets.

47:55.560 --> 47:58.233
New moon, dark skies...

47:58.320 --> 48:00.311
May I propose a toast?

48:01.800 --> 48:06.635
- Sure.
- To new moons, dark skies... and comets.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.311
Fuzzy clump.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.830
- Let me take this off.
- OK.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.676
Be careful, Bill. It's expensive.

48:47.200 --> 48:49.191
Here we go.

48:55.280 --> 48:57.510
I can't do this with him starin' at me.

49:01.040 --> 49:04.237
- Let's just go to my room.
- Are you crazy? Your parents are home.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.311
No, no. They're asleep.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.595
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.114
- I'm goin' home.
- What?

49:17.520 --> 49:19.590
Bill!

49:20.680 --> 49:23.558
No, please. Please, Bill. Please don't.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.710
Jo...

49:25.800 --> 49:28.633
- I gotta go.
- Just one more kiss.

49:39.160 --> 49:41.196
- What are you doin'?
- Poor little thing.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.635
All it needs is a little bit of fresh air.

49:45.160 --> 49:47.196
- Jo!
- What?

49:50.200 --> 49:52.919
I'm tellin' you, I love you.

49:53.960 --> 49:56.554
- I think we should make a commitment.
- OK.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.516
But... first things first, though.

50:00.320 --> 50:02.675
- Cut it out!
- What?

50:02.760 --> 50:04.239
Jo!

50:04.320 --> 50:08.393
Come on. I'm tellin' ya,
I think we ought to get married.

50:08.480 --> 50:12.359
Bill, if you say that word one more time
to me, I'm gonna scream.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.756
Married.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.632
Holy shit!

50:22.920 --> 50:26.629
- No, Pops!
- Listen, Mr Barboza. Nothing happened.

50:27.880 --> 50:29.996
Listen, I promise you...

50:32.640 --> 50:35.791
It's not what you think.
Good night, Mrs Barboza.

50:35.880 --> 50:38.269
Get the hell outta here!

50:39.000 --> 50:42.310
- Thank you, Mr Barboza!
- Run, Bill, run!

50:42.400 --> 50:45.995
- Josephina!
- Son of a bitch!

50:46.080 --> 50:50.915
So there's Pops, all 130 pounds of him,
tryin' to knock the shit out of Bill.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.596
Bill's just standin' there tryin' to be polite
and pullin' his pants up at the same time.

50:55.680 --> 50:59.593
- I nearly peed in my pants.
- So close to a clean getaway.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.149
Where's the prince of prep school
this weekend?

51:03.240 --> 51:07.119
In Greenwich visiting his grandmother.
She's 90 and drives her own Rolls.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.634
- Big deal.
- He'll be back Sunday night.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.233
Hey, Jo!

51:18.640 --> 51:20.915
Whaddaya think?

51:21.000 --> 51:24.310
That isn't funny!
Whose side are you guys on?

51:25.520 --> 51:28.830
You know something, Bill?
You are a real asshole!

51:28.920 --> 51:32.230
- What?
- Thank God I didn't marry him.

51:32.320 --> 51:36.074
What, you think this is
gonna make me marry you? Do you?

51:36.160 --> 51:39.630
Well, it's not, cos I don't have to
marry an asshole. It's the '80s.

51:39.720 --> 51:43.076
- Why would I marry an asshole?
- Jo, come on.

51:43.160 --> 51:46.311
You can't force me to do something
I'm not ready to do, Bill.

51:46.960 --> 51:50.839
- Come on! I was joking.
- And until I am, if I ever am,

51:50.920 --> 51:53.229
the answer is no.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.153
- But it's just a joke.
- No!

52:01.360 --> 52:03.351
Man!

52:03.920 --> 52:06.150
Asshole.

52:12.120 --> 52:17.353
There is no way in the world... He's sayin'
he brings in more than we do. No way.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.155
Jojo, would you hurry up?
He's gonna see us.

52:24.240 --> 52:28.870
- Hey, Bill! Get your dumb butt out here.
- Shut up. We shouldn't be doing this.

52:28.960 --> 52:32.077
What has he got back here?
I mean, God, what a stink.

52:34.600 --> 52:36.875
I told you he had a spare key.

52:36.960 --> 52:40.794
Come on, let's go.
Wait, Kat. I can't drive. I'm too plastered.

52:40.880 --> 52:44.793
There you go. This is so great.
This is just too great.

52:44.880 --> 52:46.871
"Nympho", my ass.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.991
Get a horse, you asshole.

52:57.560 --> 53:01.109
Ooh your kisses
sweeter than honey

53:02.280 --> 53:05.317
But guess what? So is my money

53:06.320 --> 53:08.470
All I want you to do for me

53:08.560 --> 53:11.028
Is give it to me

53:13.120 --> 53:15.236
Respect, just a little bit

53:15.320 --> 53:16.878
Just a little bit

53:16.960 --> 53:20.748
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
find out what it means to me

53:20.840 --> 53:24.435
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care, TCB

53:24.520 --> 53:28.399
Sock it to me sock it to me

53:33.880 --> 53:35.871
Hey, you guys. Where are we going?

53:38.880 --> 53:41.030
- The country club.
- Yes!

53:41.480 --> 53:44.995
- Come on. It's gonna be great.
- No, you guys. No.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.599
- Why?
- Come on, live a little.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.274
Kitty-cat Kat?

54:14.600 --> 54:16.591
Shit.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.191
We made it.

54:41.840 --> 54:43.990
- Oh, boy.
- Can I have a smoke?

54:44.080 --> 54:46.071
Yes.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.118
Thanks.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.998
- This is really the life, huh?
- Absolutely.

54:51.240 --> 54:54.073
Hey, Dais? You wanna do the jitterbug?

54:55.080 --> 54:58.197
Do I wanna do the jitterbug?! I lead.

54:58.280 --> 55:00.589
Hold this for me, Kat.

55:46.880 --> 55:49.235
Come on, you guys. Let's get goin'.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.515
- Why?
- Cos it's boring.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.114
It isn't boring, this is fun.

55:55.200 --> 55:57.430
You gotta relax and enjoy yourself.

56:20.600 --> 56:22.591
"Outta town".

56:25.480 --> 56:27.391
Son of a bitch!

56:32.800 --> 56:36.031
I'm gonna kill him! I'm so stupid!

56:36.120 --> 56:40.398
It's OK, Dais. Please?

56:44.880 --> 56:46.916
- Gimme the keys.
- No, Dais, I'll drive.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.197
Gimme the keys, Kat.
Gimme the goddamn key!

56:51.400 --> 56:53.755
Kat... Daisy, you don't need the key.

56:53.840 --> 56:56.718
What are you going to do with the car?

57:04.280 --> 57:06.271
Jo, we gotta stop her.

57:06.360 --> 57:08.828
- Daisy, no!
- Daisy, what are you doing?

57:26.720 --> 57:30.429
- My car!
- It's beautiful.

57:31.440 --> 57:34.477
- What are you doing?
- Greenwich, my ass!

57:34.560 --> 57:38.951
Daisy, look.
Daisy, this is Serena Windsor, my sister.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.591
Serena, this is Daisy Arujo.

57:42.640 --> 57:44.631
Daisy.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.191
Hi.

57:51.800 --> 57:53.392
Hi.

57:56.080 --> 57:59.038
How was I to know? You said
you were at your grandmother's.

57:59.120 --> 58:03.671
My grandmother had a migraine. I called
you when I came back. You were out.

58:14.520 --> 58:18.308
- I fucked up.
- Yeah, but you gave it 100% effort.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.789
- You're weird.
- I'm weird?

58:35.280 --> 58:38.113
Think you can give us a lift?

59:14.720 --> 59:16.711
- Bill.
- Hey.

59:18.160 --> 59:20.993
I'm sorry for taking the truck.

59:21.080 --> 59:24.550
That's OK. I'm sorry, too.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.279
I took it off.

59:27.360 --> 59:32.639
Guess what. My sister and her husband
are going to Marblehead for three days.

59:32.720 --> 59:36.554
- Yeah?
- What do you mean, "yeah"?

59:36.640 --> 59:39.791
Bill, we have the apartment
for three days and three nights.

59:39.880 --> 59:43.350
- Yeah, well, I don't think so, Jo.
- What, are you crazy, Bill?

59:43.440 --> 59:45.874
- Three whole nights.
- Yeah, I heard ya.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.991
I don't want to.

59:50.520 --> 59:53.159
Bill, I said I was sorry.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.553
Your parents' place, my parents' place,

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.599
your sister's apartment,
the damn john at the pizza parlour.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.791
What, Jake?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.197
I'm tellin' ya, Jo, that I love you.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.556
When people love each other,
they should make a commitment.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.108
They should have a wedding, in a church,

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.510
with the blessings of God, for chrissakes!

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.196
Don't you get it, Jo?
I'm telling you that I love you.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.469
And all you love is my dick.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.313
Do you know how that makes me feel?

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.630
I...

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.390
I'm sorry.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.038
Come on, let's go.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.635
I'm finished, Jo. I can't do this any more.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.230
Let's go!

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.271
Hi, Manny.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.151
Hi, how's it goin'?

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.470
What? What are you guys looking at?

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.915
You're three hours early.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.231
- Yeah. So?
- Yeah, so you look kinda weird.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.392
- What's up?
- Nothing. Nothing much.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.319
You pregnant, Jojo?

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.391
Bite your tongue, Leona.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.231
Somethin's goin' on.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.919
It's just... It's just that
I broke up with Bill this morning.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.918
- Oh, shit!
- No. It's no big deal. Really.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.039
I mean, Bill and I haven't been
getting along at all, and...

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.271
I just couldn't do it any more,
so I told him, and...

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.670
You know, he got real upset
and started to cry.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.751
But I had to do it, you know?

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.157
Hey, it's OK. I mean, it had to happen.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.028
I'm fine. In fact, I don't know,
I feel kinda good.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.992
I mean, if you think about it,
Bill and I are so different.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.472
Everything he wants, I don't.
The marriage, the kids, all that stuff.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.997
I mean, I really want that stuff.
Real bad. I just don't want it now.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.996
He doesn't understand.
If he really loved me, he'd wait.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.668
But I guess if I really loved him,
I'd marry him.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.751
Maybe I don't love Bill.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.595
But I really do love Bill, though.
He really... He understands me so well.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.754
No, no. You guys are right.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.590
I don't need Bill.
I've got a lot of things going.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.550
- Leona?
- What is it, honey?

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.030
One of these days you're gonna tell me
what you put in that pizza.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.111
When you retire, right?

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.668
Absolutely. When I retire.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.836
OK. So I could run this place, and...
I don't need Bill to do that.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.310
And, Kat, you're not the only one
with brains. I could go to college.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.676
I could take that course.
What is it? Economics.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.476
OK. Thanks, you guys.
You guys are great.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.475
You know, helping me out, supporting
me, telling me I made the right decision.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.113
I think I have to go to the bathroom.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.031
Men!

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.755
- Hi. I'm home.
- Hi. How's Mrs Farley today?

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.913
Oh, fine. She only called four times,
but it looks like we'll wrap it up on time.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.877
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hi.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.030
Did you catch anything?

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.429
- She sure is in a good mood.
- She's excited about Mom coming home.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.750
Yeah. Just a little while longer.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.829
- What's she like?
- Who?

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.911
- Mrs Travers.
- Nikki?

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.874
- What do you wanna know?
- Where'd you meet her?

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.951
- At school.
- Yale?

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.591
Freshman year. It's funny to think
you have all that in front of you.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.955
I look at the way you examine everything,

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.077
and I remember exactly how I felt
when I started Yale.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.469
- How did you feel?
- Scared shitless.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.436
But great. I mean, it was so exciting.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.115
I felt like I was really gonna... Iive.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.549
And you did, didn't you?

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.631
Yeah, sure. Here I am.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.630
Aw, Kat. Stuff happens.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.156
What can I say?

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.632
Hey, aren't they gonna kill you
at that pizza place?

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.950
No, they'll cover for me.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.474
Hey, rascal. Come here.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.311
Gotcha! And I'm gonna
squeeze you like a ball.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.595
- Fly me.
- You wanna fly? OK.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:05.679
Shit! Where the hell is Kat? She was
supposed to be here half an hour ago.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.832
- Easy!
- Oh, yeah. She called.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.117
They needed her baby-sitting.
She said you'd cover for her.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.113
I'm supposed to have dinner with
Charlie's parents tonight. She knows that.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.031
Shit!

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.111
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Take it easy. You're not missin' much.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.555
My dad is not exactly a load of laughs.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.792
- Your mom's gonna think I blew her off.
- My mother doesn't think. Don't worry.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.040
- We'll do it another time.
- All right.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.156
- I'll call ya.
- OK.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.953
That's what you're drivin' these days?

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.589
Well, it smells a hell of a lot
better than the Porsche.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.551
Right.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.831
Hi, Dais.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.551
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't show up.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.513
I said I'm sorry. Why are you
being such a bitch about it?

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.478
Right. I'm a bitch and you're an angel,
no matter what.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.438
Should have been stamped
on our birth certificates.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.716
What the hell's the big deal?
You unload shifts on me.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.839
Well, you knew I was supposed to meet
Charlie's parents tonight.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.269
- Dais, I'm sorry. I forgot.
- Tim needed you, right?

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:38.988
Just what the hell do you two do
together? That's what I'd like to know.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.957
- To you, it would sound stupid.
- It would sound pathetic.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.795
Daddy boffing the baby-sitter is a really
old story. It happens all the time.

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:51.517
We talk, we read,
we listen to Mozart sometimes...

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.674
You really believe this 30-year-old guy
is gonna leave his wife for you?

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.433
You're livin' in
a fuckin' romance novel, Kat.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.830
Oh, yeah. Boffing, fucking, screwing.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.429
The great Daisy. Nobody's fool.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.310
Why don't you start taking cash for
your services? It would be more honest.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.231
Wipe your conscience.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.791
Shit!

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.395
- Jojo. Pick up.
- OK, I'm coming.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.470
OK, two lite beers.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.591
This is my table.

01:09:49.399 --> 01:09:52.517
Can we change that sausage
to pepperoni?

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.591
Sure. Why not?

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.068
Hey, Jo. Do me a favour.
Sit for Phoebe tomorrow?

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.470
Yeah, right.
Baby-sittin' for the baby-sitter?

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:09.395
I think I'm gonna puke.
Yeah, I'll do it, Kit-Kat.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.515
- You know, I feel a little ridiculous.
- You're not scared, are you?

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.512
- Stormy nights?
- Kat, it's just a story.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.430
We'll see.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.954
Hope old Elias like pizza.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.951
Come on, let's eat.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.993
It'll be a shame
when they finish this place.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.953
Yeah. We all wish
we could stop time, don't we?

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.356
Well, I'm afraid it won't work.
Soon you'll be at school.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.710
Contractor'll take over from here.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.631
Nikki comes home.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.716
What was that?

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.590
- Elias Montrose!
- I told you so.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.195
Wait here.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.436
Run, run, run.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.390
Oh, there they are.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.189
How's your mother, Kat?
Did you get her the medicine in time?

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.717
Nikki.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.878
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.110
I was lucky. I caught that morning plane.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.033
- Well, you look great.
- Yeah, so do you.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.396
Hi. I'm Nikki Travers. You must be Kat.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.194
Oh, I hope your mother's feeling better.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.556
Well, thank you for everything
that you've done for Phoebe.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.313
You're all she talks about on the phone.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.595
She's a wonderful little girl.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.839
Kat, we should really get goin'.
Cos your mom must want us back.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.993
Nice meeting you, Mr Travers.
Nice meeting you, Mrs Travers.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.799
Tim, aren't you forgetting something?

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.158
- Jojo, how much do we owe you?
- Oh, no. That's OK.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.231
I don't need any money.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.999
Thanks. Come on, Kat.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.799
Kat, I didn't know what to say.
The doorbell rang, I thought it was you,

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.236
and there was this person
just standing there. I almost...

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.311
I almost peed in my pants.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.911
I don't think she knows.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.478
OK, all right, so he had his arm
around you. So what, right?

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.755
I mean, what if your mother had died?

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.832
He was just being nice.
People do that, you know.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.439
She might know, though.
She looks really smart.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.189
Holy shit, Kat. You don't think
she'd come after you or anything, do you?

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:52.239
No, she wouldn't do that.
I don't think she would do that.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:57.155
Oh, God, Kat. Well, at least it isn't
your fault, you know. It's not your fault.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.279
Oh, God. Kat, this is
really heavy-duty stuff here.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.998
God, I thought I had problems,
but I mean, I do...

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.355
At least with Bill,
what you see is what you get.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.193
But that gutless wonder back there -

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.192
he makes Bill look like
the catch of all time.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.231
Don't wear my boots again, OK?

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.396
They're nice boots, Kat.
I'd like to keep it that way.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.071
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't use
my comb, either. It's full of scuzz.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.555
Kat, are you alive?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.308
What's the matter?

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.675
What happened?

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.593
- She came back tonight.
- Shit.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.557
He just stood there.
He didn't even say a word to me.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.871
It's all right.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.117
It's gonna be tough,
but you're gonna be all right.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.951
I just feel so stupid.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.914
Why does it hurt so much?

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.392
- Let me get you a cup of tea.
- No, please. Please, just stay with me.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.551
Kat! Order up.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.596
Oh, 'scuse me. Sorry.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.314
- Excuse me. This isn't cooked.
- Sorry.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:47.639
- Hi. Ready to order?
- Yes, I believe I am.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.719
The... Mystic Pizza.
I assume that's the house special.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.392
Yes, sir. That's the special.
There's nothing like it.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.871
And bring me
a fresh glass of water, please.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.598
- Sure. Do you want some ice in it?
- No. No ice.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.913
Leona, I need the best Mystic Pizza
you've ever made.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.878
- Why?
- The Fireside Gourmet. He's here.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.712
Look.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.431
- So what?
- Leona!

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.874
- Take your pick.
- This.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.195
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:30.359
Anything else, sir? A side of clams?
We have a wonderful small house salad.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.193
No, thank you. Just the check, please.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.874
The check? You're through?

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.951
Yes.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.278
Here you go. I'll get a box
so you can take the rest home.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.874
No, thank you.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.951
Excuse me.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.555
Somebody ought to ram
fried goat cheese up his ass.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.597
Lobster for breakfast,
lobster for lunch...

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.231
Fuckin' lotta lobsters here.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.677
Ma? I'm not gonna be able to
take you to the potluck tomorrow.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.230
Charlie invited me to dinner
to meet his family.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.279
- What do you think about that?
- Guess I could get a ride with Louisa.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.148
- I mean about Charlie.
- He's not a Catholic.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.674
Or a Portuguese, or poor.
He's not a lot of things.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.116
- He's not gonna marry you, either.
- Are you kidding?

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.272
Marriage? I'm talking about
dinner with his parents.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.477
Sure. What do I know, anyway?

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.790
You think I always looked like this?

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.839
When I was your age, you think
they weren't sniffin' around after me?

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.354
Different clothes, same line.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.000
- Only I had sense.
- Thank you very much.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.596
Well, I didn't go jump in the back seat
of every sports car that came along.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.910
- You're really good at this, Ma.
- At what?

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.072
Making me feel like shit.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.435
I cursed.
Another mark against Daisy, right?

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.750
I curse, I'm stupid, I'm a slut.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.957
All I want is for you
to make something of yourself!

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.990
Yeah? Well, I'm not gonna go to Yale.
You're just gonna have to deal with that.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.189
I don't expect you to go to Yale.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.834
I'm just so worried about you.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.310
Yeah.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.789
Me too.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.511
Thank you.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.277
Oh, it looks marvellous, Elaine.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Teresa.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.396
Dig in, everybody.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.469
Out of this world, Polly. It's so tender.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.760
Mom, do you want my green stuff?

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.952
That's called the tomalley, Steamer.
It's the best part.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.998
It's the shit, Steam. Don't eat it.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.874
- Do you want a beer?
- No, thanks.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.679
Anybody else?

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:40.276
- Daisy.
- Teresa. You work here?

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.031
I help out Mrs Windsor once in a while.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.512
- You still waitressin' at the Pizza?
- Teresa?

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.034
- Yes, sir?
- How's your lobster?

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.588
It's really delicious.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.559
Charlie didn't tell us that
you were in the pizza business, Daisy.

01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.076
Mrs Windsor and I consider ourselves
pizza connoisseurs.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.671
- Really?
- I worked in a pizza place one summer.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.751
Up at the Cape. Remember, Mom?

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.308
There's nothing wrong
with being a waitress.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:14.358
A noble profession, right?

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.950
Certainly a profession, at any rate.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.631
- As opposed to what I do.
- Just what is it you do?

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.870
- Chuck...
- It's all right, Polly.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.674
I so rarely get to meet a man of leisure.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.876
Much less a close relative.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.951
Well, I owe it all to you, Dad.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.874
You gave me all the advantages
that you never had.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.310
When Dad was my age,
he was a steampipe fitter.

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.278
- Show her the calluses.
- Cut it out, Charlie.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.434
Who would like more
sour cream on their potato?

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.476
Oh, I do, please.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.596
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right, Teresa.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.797
These Portuguese girls
are very hard to train.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.838
I had one once who barely spoke...

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.313
- English?
- I didn't mean your friend.

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.630
- So what did you mean?
- Charles.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.790
I'm just clearin' the air, Dad.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.518
Aunt Tweedy...

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.956
You can't even train
your own husband to sleep at home.

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.316
And Dad's big frustration in life
is that he can't train me.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.391
- lsn't that right, Dad?
- Charlie!

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.029
- Everyone knows I can't cut the mustard.
- You listen to me...

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.315
If you can't train a golden boy like me,

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.437
there's no way you're gonna train
a dumb Portuguese.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.910
- I said that's enough!
- OK. So I guess dinner is over.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.114
- Dammit, Charlie.
- Daisy?

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:49.357
Charles? Charles, you come back here!

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.035
Dais? Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But they deserved it.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:00.238
- I couldn't let 'em do that to you.
- Me? You did that for yourself.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.914
They were bein' real jerks!

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.596
The only jerk at that table was you.
They were just being themselves.

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:12.470
Bring home your poor Portuguese girlfriend
for dinner, shake up the family a little.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.189
- That's not true.
- I'm poor, and I hate it. I admit it.

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:22.271
I even thought I was desperate,
but I'm not half as desperate as you are.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:25.352
I would never use you
to get at somebody.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:31.639
Your father didn't cheat his way out of
law school. You did that all on your own.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.711
Deal with it, Junior.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.274
You're not even good enough for me.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.479
Teresa? Can you give me a ride?

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.954
I wanna go home.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.591
Kat...

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.111
Oh, my God.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.355
Hi.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.397
Hi, Phoebe.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.194
Phoebe wanted to say goodbye.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.316
- Goodbye, Phoebe.
- Bye.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.630
- Keep going to the library, OK?
- OK.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.151
Take care.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.271
This is for you.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.351
It's for Yale.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.395
All those stars and comets
don't come cheap.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.471
Thank you.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.949
Goodbye, Tim.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.592
Yeah. Well, I guess... we better go.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.989
Bye, Kat.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.831
Kat?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.275
Are you out of your mind?

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.794
If you initial this, you can still cash it.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.791
She doesn't need the money that bad.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.553
Oh, yeah? How is she gonna pay for Yale?

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.231
She'll find a way.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.673
What now?

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.399
..a hole in the wall
called the Mystic Pizza.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.278
- Moron.
- The atmosphere was rustic,

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.635
the service was oversolicitous.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.872
- Is that good?
- Now, I am not a pizza person.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.236
I am not particularly
fond of cheesy cuisine,

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.231
and this pizza is...

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.153
How shall I say this? In a word...

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.072
superb.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.395
I ordered the house speciality,
the Mystic Pizza. Mystic indeed.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:00.758
Exactly the right blend
of cheese and tomatoes and spices

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.956
that I can't quite identify.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.153
You bet your ass you can't.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.710
That's the Mystic Pizza,
in Mystic, Connecticut.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.360
I have to give them my highest rating.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.715
Four stars.

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.030
And you thought the man was a moron.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.196
Hello, Mystic Pizza.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.911
I beg your pardon?

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:32.119
No, no. No reservations are necessary.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.596
Reservations!

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.671
Yes. Yes, Main Street.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.035
This is Hector Pleshette wishing you...

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.829
Bill, this is important.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.994
I don't want you to get the wrong idea,
but I gotta maintain my own identity.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.514
Maintain your own identity.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.478
Right. I mean,
I understand about commitment,

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.710
and I love you more than anything.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.360
But you gotta know exactly where I stand,

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.193
because absolutely nothing has changed.

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.431
Except your name.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.231
Except my name.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.909
Who you wanna dance with, me or Kat?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.991
Not you.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.752
It's for Yale.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.831
You'll pay me back.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.233
- No, l...
- No, Vic and I talked about this.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.516
We don't have any kids of our own.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.595
Daisy, Jojo... you.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.110
You're my kids. So...

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.834
Thanks, Leona.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.911
Hey! You're messin' up my dress.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.833
Karen, you wanna take this out?

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.191
It's a great party.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.631
What do you want, Charlie?

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.391
Listen.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.992
What you said about me and my father...

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:10.080
You were right.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.913
- So?
- I owe you an apology.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.351
OK.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.871
So...

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:23.035
So?

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:36.838
So you like chocolate ice cream?

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.159
It's my favourite.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.356
Well, this must be your lucky night.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.271
Keep it up.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.071
Thought I'd find you out here.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.190
I see you had some company in there.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.631
Who knows?

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:37.029
God, next Thursday's Thanksgiving.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.471
Soon I'll be at college.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:45.152
- Do me a favour?
- What's that?

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.996
Next time you take on a Yalie,
pick one your own age?

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.914
- Who knows?
- Hey, you guys.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.232
You're not gonna believe what Bill's mom
just said to me. You're gonna die.

01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:01.269
She came up to me and she said "So,
when am I gonna hear some good news?"

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.831
I mean, I've been married two hours
and she wants me knocked up already!

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.317
I really love you guys.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.798
- You know what I wonder?
- What?

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.389
What the hell do you think
Leona really puts in that pizza?

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.990
