Yes?

14:47.846 --> 14:48.847
(GLASS SHATTERING)

15:05.864 --> 15:07.533
Anything wrong,
Vargas?

15:07.783 --> 15:08.784
(CHUCKLES)

15:09.326 --> 15:11.829
No, I just
couldn't catch him.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.501
I hardly knew her.

15:19.295 --> 15:20.296
Adair, come on.

15:20.379 --> 15:23.382
Yes, yes, and I'm not
finished with you yet.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.342
The show's over.
I'm going home.

15:25.426 --> 15:26.468
Oh. Oh, no.
No, ma'am.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.780
Mr. Adair, as far as
I can find out...
I have no time for that.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.323
...none of these people
even knew the murdered girl.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.474
I must talk to
this young lady.
Zita.

15:32.558 --> 15:34.852
Zita?
I didn't know her.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.104
She only joined the show
a few days ago.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.188
(GRUNTING)

15:38.272 --> 15:39.940
We're wasting our time
around here.

15:40.024 --> 15:43.068
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Well, good night, my dear.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.882
SCHWARTZ: What happened to
Menzies and Vargas?

15:47.906 --> 15:49.450
I don't know.
They'll show up.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.202
I'll give you a call.
There may be
some more questions.

15:52.286 --> 15:53.787
(PIANOLA PLAYING)

15:53.871 --> 15:54.955
A pianola.

15:55.039 --> 15:57.333
Hank, we go
this way, you know.

15:57.416 --> 16:01.170
Tana still open
for business?

16:39.625 --> 16:42.795
I don't know
what Quinlan thinks
she's got to do with it.

16:42.878 --> 16:48.092
Oh, maybe
she'll cook chili for him
or bring out the crystal ball.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.277
We're closed.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.707
You've been cooking
at this hour?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.459
Just cleaning up.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.922
Have you forgotten
your old friend, hmm?

17:27.923 --> 17:29.299
I told you
we were closed.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.218
I'm Hank Quinlan.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.514
I didn't
recognize you.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.225
You should lay off
those candy bars.

17:38.434 --> 17:39.435
(GRUNTING)

17:39.601 --> 17:43.147
It's either the candy
or the hooch.

17:44.273 --> 17:47.818
I must say,
I wish it was your chili
I was getting fat on.

17:49.153 --> 17:51.613
Anyway, you're sure
looking good.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.533
You're a mess, honey.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.951
Yeah.

17:57.161 --> 17:59.955
That pianola sure
brings back memories.

18:01.373 --> 18:02.958
The customers go for it.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.918
It's so old, it's new.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.921
We got the television, too.

18:11.675 --> 18:16.054
We run movies.
What can I offer you?

18:16.180 --> 18:19.391
You haven't heard anything
about that bomb, have you?

18:21.059 --> 18:23.061
That happened
on your side
of the border.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.731
In a place like this,
you hear things.

18:27.483 --> 18:29.443
I heard the explosion.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.694
Yeah.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.778
(SCOFFS)

18:32.863 --> 18:34.448
Well, when this case
is over,

18:34.531 --> 18:39.161
I must come around some night
and sample some of your chili.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.372
Better be careful.
May be too hot for you.

18:42.498 --> 18:43.499
(HARUMPHS)

18:44.666 --> 18:46.293
Oh, Hank.
Yeah?

18:46.376 --> 18:49.004
Looks like
our friend Vargas
ran into some trouble.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.548
Where?
In the alley
behind the nightclub.

18:51.632 --> 18:52.758
Yeah?

18:57.763 --> 18:59.741
QUINLAN: What happened
to Vargas...
What happened? What was that?

18:59.765 --> 19:01.266
Nothing.
QUINLAN: No, no...

19:01.350 --> 19:03.018
Al!
Certainly
nothing to do

19:03.101 --> 19:04.478
with this
bombing affair.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.313
Somebody
threw acid
at Vargas.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.232
It doesn't matter.
He missed me.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.858
Well, who was it, Al?

19:09.942 --> 19:11.068
I don't know,
he got away.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.861
Oh...

19:12.945 --> 19:14.154
One of the Grandi kids.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.949
VARGAS: What makes you
so sure of that,
Captain?

19:17.032 --> 19:18.116
Intuition.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.368
Intuition?

19:19.451 --> 19:22.538
Well, Vargas
and his Keystone Kops

19:22.621 --> 19:24.581
have given
the Grandi family
quite a few...

19:24.665 --> 19:26.166
Captain.
...headaches lately. Yes?

19:26.250 --> 19:29.253
Does your intuition
also tell you
about my wife?

19:29.419 --> 19:31.463
Wife?
She was accosted
in the street

19:31.547 --> 19:35.133
a little while ago
and led across to some dive
on your side of the border.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.218
(GRUNTING)

19:36.760 --> 19:41.390
Vargas family seems to be
getting into quite
a lot of trouble tonight.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.685
Can you
describe this man?

19:44.810 --> 19:49.773
The first one seems
young, good-looking...
The first one.
Now there were two men?

19:49.940 --> 19:52.067
Not exactly.
Not exactly.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.987
You say
she was taken to
this dive by force?

19:55.070 --> 19:57.364
Not by force, no.
Oh.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.366
One of the Grandis
was there waiting.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.994
Short, fat, with
a mustache. That's...
Uncle Joe.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.013
...Susie's description.
I haven't run into him.
What?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.581
They call him
Uncle Joe Grandi.

20:05.664 --> 20:06.790
That's right.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.042
Go on.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.789
What do you mean "go on"?
I've told you what happened.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.478
Aren't you going to do
something about it?

20:14.548 --> 20:16.508
To make it a charge
you gotta
ask the complainer,

20:16.592 --> 20:18.427
or isn't that
police procedure
in Mexico?

20:18.552 --> 20:20.220
Procedure?
You say your wife
was attacked.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.615
I did not say
she was attacked.
Did you say she was molested?

20:22.639 --> 20:24.224
Not physically molested, no.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.935
Was obscene language used?
I don't think so.

20:27.019 --> 20:29.187
Can you explain the fact
that your wife

20:29.271 --> 20:30.999
allowed herself
to be picked up
by this good-looking...

20:31.023 --> 20:32.399
She was not
picked up.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.419
Now, Hank,
I think we're getting off
on the wrong tack here.

20:34.443 --> 20:36.523
Then
this good-looking young man
was a friend of hers?

20:36.570 --> 20:37.988
Obviously not.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.799
You wouldn't call that
"getting picked up
on the street"?

20:39.823 --> 20:42.743
Now, now, now.
We mustn't forget, must we,

20:42.826 --> 20:45.120
that Mr. Vargas is not
on the witness stand.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.998
(CHUCKLING)
And Hank's a born lawyer,
you know?

20:48.081 --> 20:51.293
Lawyer. I'm no lawyer.
All a lawyer cares about
is the law.

20:51.376 --> 20:54.630
Captain, you are
a policeman, aren't you?

20:54.713 --> 20:57.424
Aren't you? You don't seem
to be very fond of the job.

20:57.507 --> 21:00.427
There are
plenty of soldiers
who don't like war.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.679
It's a dirty job,
enforcing the law,

21:02.763 --> 21:04.657
but it's what we're
supposed to be doing,
isn't it?

21:04.681 --> 21:07.517
I don't know about you,
but when a murderer is loose,

21:07.601 --> 21:09.061
I'm supposed to catch him.

21:11.897 --> 21:16.151
Well, Pete, let's get back
to civilization.

21:26.328 --> 21:29.706
Let's go, Hank,
it's almost dawn.
You gotta get some rest.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.419
No chance of that, partner.
We got a big day
ahead of us.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.760
See any better
this way?

22:29.891 --> 22:33.770
You can turn it off now,
buster. You're wasting
your batteries.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.363
(LIGHT BULB SHATTERING)

22:43.447 --> 22:47.033
Susie, what are you
doing here in the dark?

22:47.784 --> 22:50.620
There isn't any shade
on the window.

22:51.455 --> 22:54.040
Well, can we turn
the light on now?

22:54.124 --> 22:55.667
No, we can't.

22:55.751 --> 22:56.918
Why not?

22:57.002 --> 22:59.796
Because there isn't
any bulb anymore.

Risto! Risto!

Stop him!

23:24.654 --> 23:26.156
Grab him, Sal!

to throw acid
at Vargas?

23:30.368 --> 23:31.661
Stop him!

23:35.624 --> 23:38.502
Who told you
to throw acid
at Vargas, hmm?

23:40.420 --> 23:42.547
Who is the boss
of this family?

23:42.631 --> 23:43.631
Who is the boss?

23:43.673 --> 23:44.799
My old man.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.552
Yeah, Vic, sure.
But he's in the pen!

23:47.636 --> 23:50.805
Until he gets out,
who's running this outfit?

23:50.889 --> 23:52.474
Stop it, will you?
Who's in charge?

23:52.557 --> 23:53.808
All right.
You.

23:53.892 --> 23:54.893
(GRUNTING)

23:55.810 --> 23:57.979
What a setup
to work with.

23:58.063 --> 24:00.732
One brother in jail,
two others dead,

24:00.857 --> 24:04.194
and nobody left
to carry on the business
but a bunch of nephews.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.862
Listen, Uncle...
Don't do that!

24:05.946 --> 24:07.006

behind the ears...

I'm very glad
you're very glad.

start this funny stuff
with the acid?

24:47.654 --> 24:48.989
Who told you?

24:49.072 --> 24:50.550
I just wanted
to give that wife of his

something to think about
on the honeymoon.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.331
What?
You lost your rug.

is in no shape
for the pen.

he dies.

what happens?

is just as good as convicted.

I'm sorry. I have to meet him.

Now you must tell me
what you want to do.

26:10.612 --> 26:15.450
If you are going
to Mexico City, I have time
to take you to the airport.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.745
Perhaps that would be best,
just for a few days.

26:18.828 --> 26:19.913
I don't think so.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.915
But just
a minute ago...

26:21.998 --> 26:23.458
A minute ago
I said
a lot of things.

But now I think
the best thing is to stick
close to my husband, okay?

Coming with me?

But I have to see Quinlan
at the American
police station.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.436
I'll wait
at the motel.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.604
What motel?

26:44.688 --> 26:47.982
Well, there must be one
somewhere on the American
side of the border.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.859
The American side
of the border.

26:49.943 --> 26:53.947
Oh, well, I'll be safe there.
You won't have to
worry about me.

26:54.030 --> 26:56.533
Did I say
the wrong thing again?

26:57.158 --> 27:00.787
No. I suppose it would be nice
for a man in my place

27:00.870 --> 27:04.374
to be able to think he could
look after his own wife
in his own country.

27:04.457 --> 27:08.044
Oh, Mike,
if I go to the American motel,
it's just for comfort.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.212
Sure. Sure.

39:50.681 --> 39:53.034
QUINLAN: That's how
you happened to meet
Linnekar's daughter, isn't it?

39:53.058 --> 39:54.786
In the shoe store?
SANCHEZ: Yes.
Selling her shoes.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.353
And I've been at her feet
ever since.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.813
QUINLAN:
Then the construction job.

39:57.897 --> 40:01.817
You stayed just long enough
on that one to get your hands
on some dynamite.

40:01.901 --> 40:06.113
What are you scared of, boy?
I'd only slap you again
if you got hysterical again.

40:06.197 --> 40:07.740
Wouldn't be anything brutal.

40:07.823 --> 40:12.411
Why, back in the old days,
we never tried to hurt people
in the face. It marks them up.

40:12.495 --> 40:13.680
We gave it to them
like this...

40:13.704 --> 40:14.705
(SANCHEZ GRUNTING)

40:15.581 --> 40:17.750
Boy's getting
a rough deal.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.419
He could even be innocent,
you know.

40:20.503 --> 40:21.754
Intuition?

40:21.837 --> 40:22.922
Why not?

40:23.005 --> 40:25.591
Quinlan doesn't have
a monopoly on hunches.

40:25.674 --> 40:27.760
Well,
who do you like
for the killer?

40:27.843 --> 40:30.679
Too early to tell.
That ex-convict.

40:30.763 --> 40:32.932
You mean, out on
that highway job?

40:33.015 --> 40:34.433
Farnham?
Maybe.

40:34.517 --> 40:36.727
Wait a minute.
Some dynamite
was stolen.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.022
Yeah, and
that construction crew
is working for Linnekar.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.333
<i>Amigo,</i> I think you're
on to something.

40:41.357 --> 40:44.735
Well,
it's quite an apartment
for a shoe clerk.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.321
Who pays for it?
Marcia?

40:47.404 --> 40:48.447
What if
she does?

40:48.531 --> 40:50.407
Oh, how long has
this been going on, huh?

40:50.491 --> 40:52.135
Ever since her father
had me fired
from the last job,

40:52.159 --> 40:53.159
if you want to know.

40:53.202 --> 40:56.997
Naturally, he objected to
having a Mexican shoe clerk
for a son-in-law.

40:57.081 --> 40:58.457
So, naturally...
"Naturally"?

40:58.541 --> 41:00.793
...you had to put him
out of the way.
"Naturally"?

41:01.043 --> 41:02.083
(SANCHEZ SPEAKING SPANISH)

41:02.211 --> 41:03.754
Just because he speaks
a little guilty

41:03.837 --> 41:05.798
that don't
make him innocent,
you know?

41:05.881 --> 41:09.134
You can show motive, yes.
But won't you need
a bit more than that?

41:09.218 --> 41:12.721
Yeah, we'll get it.
Oh, there's my coffee.

41:12.805 --> 41:16.809
Didn't you bring me
any donuts or sweet rolls?

41:16.892 --> 41:18.936
You'll have to put him
on the scene of the crime.

41:19.019 --> 41:20.938
We will.
You've got to have
some evidence.

41:21.021 --> 41:23.399
We'll get it.
Well?

41:23.482 --> 41:25.418
ED: Well, you didn't ask me
to get any donuts, Captain.

41:25.442 --> 41:27.152
Where you going?

41:27.570 --> 41:29.655
This is not
my case, Captain.

41:29.738 --> 41:32.032
What finally
convinced you of that?

41:32.116 --> 41:35.619
This is not my country,
that's all.
I'm not convinced.

41:36.245 --> 41:38.080
Well,
ain't that a shame?

41:38.747 --> 41:40.016
Is there another phone
near here?

Right across the street.

41:55.055 --> 41:58.767
Excuse me. Madam,
could I use your telephone,
please?

41:58.851 --> 42:00.561
Right in front of you.

42:01.145 --> 42:03.188
Do you have
a phone book?

42:03.272 --> 42:05.566
I'm blind, mister.
You'll have to
ask for information.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.359
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:13.532 --> 42:17.703
Hello? I'd like
the telephone number
of the Mirador Motel.

42:17.786 --> 42:19.997
What is this place
you're taking me to?
Get going.

42:20.122 --> 42:22.958
Now, listen,
this is ridiculous.
Now go on.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.460
Who's this?
Who are you?

42:24.543 --> 42:26.045
Don't push.
Where's Captain Quinlan?

42:26.128 --> 42:27.546
He's in there
making a search.

42:27.629 --> 42:28.629
What am I
doing in here?

42:28.672 --> 42:29.715
Oh, Hank!

42:29.798 --> 42:32.384
QUINLAN: (SHOUTING)
What's the idea, barging in
on me like this?

42:32.468 --> 42:33.908
I'm sorry, Hank.
Who you got in here?

42:33.969 --> 42:35.864
I forgot to give you
your cane.
All right, sit down.

42:35.888 --> 42:37.389
Queer thing, Hank.

42:37.473 --> 42:40.225
I know him.
When I was taking
Mrs. Vargas to the motel

42:40.309 --> 42:41.602
I picked this guy
on the way.

42:41.685 --> 42:45.230
I know. It's Uncle Joe Grandi.
Why'd you bring him in here?

42:45.314 --> 42:48.776
For some crazy reason,
he was following me
in his car.

42:48.859 --> 42:49.860
He was tailing you?

42:49.943 --> 42:51.487
Yeah.

42:51.653 --> 42:52.654
(CHUCKLING)

42:54.615 --> 42:57.576
Why would I be
following a cop?
He's an idiot.

42:57.659 --> 43:00.245
Maybe because you thought
he was a Mexican cop.

43:00.329 --> 43:03.415
Because you thought
he was Vargas.
He was driving Vargas' car.

43:03.499 --> 43:04.500
Oh.

43:04.708 --> 43:05.751
Right?

43:05.834 --> 43:08.837
So, you're right. So I thought
I was following Vargas.
So what?

43:08.921 --> 43:10.506
Sit down.

43:10.589 --> 43:11.924
It's a free country.

why you called?

To tell me
somebody's been arrested?

No, that's not really
why I called. It's...

kill her father
for his money.

Boy, if I had that
kind of power, I wouldn't be
where I am today, believe me.

You mean
you don't care
about the money?

45:37.486 --> 45:39.255
Why should I lie?
If it hadn't been
for the money,

45:39.279 --> 45:40.507
I wouldn't have
given her a tumble.
Oh, no?

at the beginning,

Are you finished?
Anything more
you wanna say, Vargas?

Now, in English, just
how much dynamite
was it you stole?

any dynamite?

He did all he could to keep
you away from his daughter

a million bucks, so naturally
you just moved in here.

were married. Secretly.

Ain't no secret about that.

SANCHEZ: Why don't you
let up for a minute?

QUINLAN: So you got yourself
this highway job...

47:56.458 --> 47:58.311

the explosives bin
and stole...

47:58.335 --> 47:59.419
SANCHEZ: That's a lie!

47:59.503 --> 48:00.897

had been a snake there
in the bathroom

48:11.515 --> 48:12.724

bitten me.

I promised Chief Gould that
I'd keep you informed, Vargas,
so I'm doing it.

48:18.188 --> 48:21.817

with eight sticks of dynamite

48:21.900 --> 48:23.485
and Sanchez stole ten.

48:23.902 --> 48:25.904
That leaves two
and we found them both.

48:25.987 --> 48:29.116
You heard that, boy.
We found the dynamite.

48:30.617 --> 48:32.744
That's impossible.
We found two sticks.

48:32.869 --> 48:34.472
Black Fox,
the identical brand.
The right number.

48:34.496 --> 48:36.724
Where did you find this?
Right brand.
Right here in your love nest.

48:36.748 --> 48:38.917
Where?
Where you had it
stashed, of course.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.001
What are you
trying to do?

48:40.085 --> 48:41.938
We're trying to strap you
to the electric chair, boy.

48:41.962 --> 48:45.132
We don't like it
when innocent people are
blown to jelly in our town.

48:45.215 --> 48:48.927
Yes, an old lady
on Main Street last night
picked up a shoe.

48:49.010 --> 48:52.597
The shoe had a foot in it.
We're gonna make you
pay for that mess.

48:52.681 --> 48:54.391
They're trying to
railroad me.
Yeah.

48:54.474 --> 48:57.436
I don't know why.
I never stole
any dynamite.

48:57.519 --> 48:58.645

stop him yourself.

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:13.087
You! In the next room.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.174
What is it?

01:01:16.257 --> 01:01:19.010
Come to the wall
so I can whisper.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:25.016
Yes?

01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:30.313
You know what the boys
are trying to do, don't you?

01:01:32.315 --> 01:01:35.026
They are trying
to get in there.

01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:37.945
They went to get
the master key.

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:42.158
You know what
marijuana is,
don't you?

01:01:45.244 --> 01:01:46.621
Yes.

01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:50.166
You know what
a Mary Jane is?

You know what
a mainliner is?

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.967
Well, I think so.

01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:02.345
But what's that
got to do with me?

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:06.390
They take it
in the vein.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.853
You're trying to tell me
these boys are drugged?

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.355
(WOMAN SHUSHING)
Is that why...

01:02:14.357 --> 01:02:17.360
Hey, you think
they're ready
for that stuff yet?

01:02:19.195 --> 01:02:20.821
Not yet, kid.

01:02:25.368 --> 01:02:27.286
The fun
is only beginning.

01:02:29.247 --> 01:02:31.332
Hank, I've been
looking for you
in every bar in town.

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:35.670
I've been in half of them,
but only here on the
wrong side of the border.

01:02:37.255 --> 01:02:38.839
I never drink
on my own beat but...

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:40.567
Bartender, give him
some black coffee, quick.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:42.653
I don't need black coffee.
Quick.
He's called a meeting.

01:02:42.677 --> 01:02:45.179
A meeting?
Vargas, at his hotel.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.681
Motel?

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.349
No, right here,
across the street.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.768
Well, I don't need
any coffee, not yet.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:51.851
Not yet?

01:02:52.395 --> 01:02:53.995
This is a swell time
to be getting fried,

01:02:54.063 --> 01:02:56.232
I must say.
My job's over, Pete.
You ought to be over...

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:58.293
Listen, Hank.
...at the apartment
working on Sanchez.

01:02:58.317 --> 01:03:00.587
We gotta break this kid.
Vargas is telling
the chief and the D.A.

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:01.988
that you planted
that dynamite.

01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:03.239
He was a fool.

01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:04.615
They're taking him
seriously.

01:03:04.699 --> 01:03:06.242
They came to him.
No, I mean Sanchez.

01:03:06.325 --> 01:03:08.119
Dynamite's
no way to kill.

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:10.454
Did I ever tell you
the smart way to kill,
Pete?

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.498
Sure, sure.
Strangling.
Mmm.

01:03:13.249 --> 01:03:15.042
Clean. Silent.

01:03:15.126 --> 01:03:16.168
You told me
all that.

01:03:16.252 --> 01:03:17.980
That's how my wife died.
Come on, finish that coffee.

01:03:18.004 --> 01:03:19.839
I don't usually
talk about my wife.

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:21.716
Never when
you're sober.

01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:24.302
She was strangled,
Pete.

01:03:24.385 --> 01:03:25.845
I know, I know.

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:28.180
Binding cord.
She was working
up at the packing plant,

01:03:28.264 --> 01:03:30.808
so the killer had it
right to hand. Smart.

01:03:31.517 --> 01:03:34.478
You don't leave fingerprints
on a piece of string.

01:03:34.604 --> 01:03:36.397
Bartender,
what do I owe you?

01:03:36.522 --> 01:03:38.149
That half-breed done it,
of course.

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:41.110
We all knew that
but I was just
a rookie cop.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:42.570
MAN: $4.75.

01:03:42.695 --> 01:03:46.324
And I followed around
after him,
eating my heart out

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:49.410
trying to catch him.

01:03:49.744 --> 01:03:51.329
(CASH REGISTER RINGS)
But I never did.

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:56.792
Then in some mud hole
in Belgium, the good Lord
done the job for me. 1917.

01:03:56.876 --> 01:04:00.546
Pete, that was
the last killer that ever
got out of my hands.

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:02.441
Where're you going now?
Where do you think?

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:06.052
To <i>Señor</i> Vargas' meeting.
He wants to fight dirty, okay.

01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:08.679
(LAUGHING)
That's the kind of fight
he's gonna get.

01:04:08.763 --> 01:04:09.805
Perhaps...

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:10.931
Perhaps what?

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:13.434
Perhaps he honestly
thinks that Sanchez
is guilty.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.603
Of course he does.
There's no "perhaps" about it.

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:16.979
Hank Quinlan
is an honest cop.

01:04:17.063 --> 01:04:18.415
There are all kinds
of policemen, sir.

01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:19.440
Oh.

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:22.401
I don't have to
tell you that.
A few take bribes.

01:04:22.485 --> 01:04:24.205
Hank Quinlan
never took a dollar
in his life.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:25.696
VARGAS: Most are honest, yes.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:30.451
But even some of
the honest men abuse
their power in other ways.

01:04:31.744 --> 01:04:33.120
Come in, Hank.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:36.415
Well, I...

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:40.002
I don't know whether
I'm welcome or not.

01:04:40.086 --> 01:04:42.254
I want you
to hear this.

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:46.676
I've heard it
already.

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:49.887
Your friend Vargas
has some very special ideas
about police procedure.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.407
He seems to think
it don't matter whether
a killer's hanged or not,

01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:54.271
so long as we
obey the fine print
in rule books.

01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:57.520
Well, Captain, I don't think
a policeman should work
like a dogcatcher...

01:04:57.603 --> 01:04:59.271
No?
...putting criminals
behind bars.

01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:03.693
No. In any free country,
a policeman is supposed
to enforce the law

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:05.629
and the law
protects the guilty
as well as the innocent.

01:05:05.653 --> 01:05:08.072
Our job is tough enough.
It's supposed to be.

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:10.157
It has to be tough.

01:05:10.241 --> 01:05:12.743
A policeman's job
is only easy
in a police state.

01:05:12.827 --> 01:05:14.995
That's the whole point,
Captain.

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:17.832
Who is the boss?
The cop or the law?

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:19.583
Where's your wife,
Vargas?

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:21.752
What do...
What do you mean?

01:05:21.836 --> 01:05:23.188
You know where she is
as well as I do.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:26.424
Sergeant Menzies drove her.
She's at the motel.

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:29.885
Oh? And you're
still here?

01:05:29.969 --> 01:05:32.096
Yes, I'm checking out now
and joining her.

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:33.806
Do you have a reason
for asking?

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:36.976
No. No special reason, no.

01:05:37.852 --> 01:05:40.229
I just wondered.

01:05:40.312 --> 01:05:44.024
Oh, what do you know?
A mother pigeon
and her nest.

01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:46.110
Pigeon egg.

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:49.113
Captain, you did buy
17 sticks of dynamite.

01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:52.783
You tell your story, Vargas.
I don't have to
answer your questions.

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:54.410
A hired hand
at your ranch says...

01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:57.037
My ranch?
...he used 15 sticks.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.585
You been spying out
at my ranch?

01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:04.855
A foreigner!
Without my knowledge, Hank!

01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:06.440
Without my permission.
At your ranch you used

01:06:06.464 --> 01:06:09.341
15 sticks of dynamite,
Quinlan. That leaves
two sticks missing,

01:06:09.425 --> 01:06:11.027
and two sticks were found
in that shoe box.

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:14.472
He's just asking, Hank.
Hank!

01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:15.848
What's that for?

01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:19.643
It's for
letting him ask.

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:20.895
Well, Hank,
wait a minute!

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:24.315
Thirty years. Thirty years
you pound beats
and ride in cars.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.859
Thirty years
of dirt-crummy pay.
But, Hank...

01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:28.982
I gave my life to this...
Watch your blood pressure!

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.668
And you allow this foreigner
to accuse me!

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:32.048
We were giving you
a chance to answer!

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:33.949
Answer? Why do I
have to answer him?

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:35.117
No, sir!

01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:39.580
I won't take back that badge
until the people
of this county vote it back!

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:40.664
Oh.

01:06:40.748 --> 01:06:42.666
Hank, will you listen
a minute?

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.169
I don't want ever to see
that man in headquarters

01:06:45.252 --> 01:06:46.754
for any reason
at any time!

01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:48.172
Now, you backed him up!
Me?

01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:50.508
You stood by
while he impugned
the integrity

01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:52.861
of Captain Quinlan
and Sergeant Menzies.
I tried to stop him!

01:06:52.885 --> 01:06:55.262
Do you realize
what Vargas has done?

01:06:55.346 --> 01:06:57.264
He's smearing
hundreds of fine men!

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:58.974
Are you satisfied?

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:01.560
Have you caused
enough trouble?
Are you satisfied?

01:07:01.644 --> 01:07:03.187
I want you
to apologize!

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:04.647
To Quinlan?
And to Chief Gould.

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.249
Would you like me
to get down on my knees?

01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:08.359
If you have any decency,
you will, yes.
You'll crawl!

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:13.364
Mr. Adair, I won't give you
the chance to test
your authority in this matter.

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:22.122
Al, have I still
any credit left
with you?

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:24.083
Some.

01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:28.546
Tell me,
where can I find the records
of Quinlan's old cases?

01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:29.797
I'll show you.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.340
I'd like to get back
to my wife.

01:07:31.423 --> 01:07:33.801
I hope
this won't take
too long.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.052
Hank.
Hmm?

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:37.263
You're not going
without this.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:48.899
Well, now I guess
I can talk.

01:07:48.983 --> 01:07:50.276
What do you mean,
Hank?

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:53.654
All I wanted to tell you was
I couldn't really say
in my own defense.

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:54.905
Go on, Hank.

01:07:54.989 --> 01:07:57.700
What do you really
know about
this Vargas?

01:07:57.783 --> 01:08:01.537
Isn't he in charge
of some kind of cleanup here
on this side of the border?

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.289
Narcotics, mainly?

01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:04.999
Yeah. Narcotics.

01:08:05.541 --> 01:08:10.921
He's a drug addict.
He's got that young wife
of his hooked, too.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:13.549
But good.

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:16.135
If I hadn't seen
that hypodermic myself...

01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:19.138
Hypodermic? You saw it?
I just said so, didn't I?

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.055
Oh, sure.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:25.644
That's how come he happened to
imagine all those crazy
things. It's typical.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:29.814
That's what that wife of his
was doing in that dive
on skid row.

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:33.319
Both a couple of junkies.
Course, he's using the job

01:08:34.236 --> 01:08:35.863
as a cover-up.

01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:38.550
You don't mean he's mixed up
in this dope racket himself?

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:39.575
Uh-huh.

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.993
Hank, if this is just
one of your hunches...

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:44.246
I don't ask you
to believe it.
I can prove it.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:46.582
I know it isn't
my department, but...

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:52.671
I'd like to show you
I'm not talking outta
the back of my neck.

01:08:52.755 --> 01:08:54.006
Just be careful, huh?

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:56.383
Chief,
I'll be very careful.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.304
This takes guts, Al.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.598
Standing up to your boss
this way.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.559
After today, <i>amigo,</i>
you can do me a favor.

01:09:05.643 --> 01:09:06.683
Help me look
for an office.

01:09:06.727 --> 01:09:07.853
How's that?

01:09:07.937 --> 01:09:11.814
Hank Quinlan's famous
intuition might still turn out
to be better than yours.

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:16.319
If so, my intuition tells me
I'll be going back
to private practice.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:17.714
Here are the other names
you want...

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:20.950
Look, Al, I can
finish this alone.

01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:22.952
Yes, and maybe
you can't.

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:26.537
Well, let me
try anyway.

01:09:26.622 --> 01:09:29.625
I have no right to drag you
further into this.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:30.960
Gonna do it
alone, huh?

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.544

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.863
I guess you were somehow
thinking of your wife,
the way she was strangled.

01:39:52.988 --> 01:39:58.202
Oh, I'm always
thinking of her,
drunk or sober.

Right.
Remember that?

01:40:49.294 --> 01:40:53.340
I was the one

you planted it for me to find.

Why Vargas?
Why should he...

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:44.516
