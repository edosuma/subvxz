Male narrator:
Terror at the Temple!

00:18.585 --> 00:20.589
The Jedi Temple is in disarray

00:20.652 --> 00:22.889
after a vicious terrorist attack.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.958
Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano

00:24.992 --> 00:26.259
set out to find the truth

00:26.293 --> 00:29.262
of who was really behind
this horrendous catastrophe.

00:29.296 --> 00:32.631
Their investigation led them
to discover the true saboteur,

00:32.667 --> 00:34.301
Letta Turmond.

00:34.335 --> 00:37.571
Now the Jedi attempt to return
the Temple to normalcy.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.307
But first Master Yoda must give a eulogy

00:40.342 --> 00:42.877
to the fallen Jedi warriors.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.080
One with the Force, they are.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.849
And our job it is
to remember that we will,

00:49.883 --> 00:52.518
in time, also pass on.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.453
Luminous beings are we,

00:54.488 --> 00:57.222
but temporary vessels, our bodies are.

00:57.257 --> 01:01.560
And we shall all find ourselves
here in time.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.595
A moment of silence, I ask,

01:03.630 --> 01:07.333
to remember and to move on.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.371
You were close to one of them?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.139
Tutso Mara.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.809
We trained together.

01:16.843 --> 01:20.279
He taught me how to hold
my lightsaber correctly.

01:20.313 --> 01:24.550
Live for the living Jedi, we must.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.287
Live through us, forever they will.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.978
So what happens to Letta now?

01:52.012 --> 01:53.212
The bomber has been moved.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.313
Moved?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.381
Where?

01:55.415 --> 01:57.483
Why should she be moved?

01:57.517 --> 02:00.219
The Republic military
has taken her into custody.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.753
But why?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.989
This is a Jedi matter, isn't it?

02:04.023 --> 02:05.324
Clones were killed,

02:05.358 --> 02:06.992
which makes this terrorist attack

02:07.026 --> 02:08.693
a military matter.

02:08.728 --> 02:12.097
An attack on the Jedi
is an attack on the Senate.

02:12.131 --> 02:13.932
Admiral Tarkin is right.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.734
Letta isn't a Jedi.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.502
It's not for us to be judge and jury

02:17.536 --> 02:18.970
over a citizen of the Republic.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.473
If Letta's guilty, she's guilty,

02:21.507 --> 02:23.442
and she should be dealt with.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.877
Calm down, Ahsoka.

02:24.911 --> 02:28.413
Remember, revenge is not the Jedi way.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.517
The evidence seems clear, Ahsoka.

02:32.551 --> 02:34.853
Nothing will ever change.

02:34.887 --> 02:36.821
The Chancellor feels very strongly

02:36.856 --> 02:38.123
that the Jedi be removed

02:38.157 --> 02:41.659
from as many military matters
as possible.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.862
You yourselves
said that you're peacekeepers,

02:44.897 --> 02:46.731
not soldiers.

02:46.765 --> 02:49.634
I hope Chancellor Palpatine
knows what he's doing.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.870
I assure you
that he rarely does anything

02:51.904 --> 02:53.505
without a strategy.

02:53.539 --> 02:55.040
[elevator beeps]

02:59.178 --> 03:02.647
I have many things
to attend to, Masters.

03:02.681 --> 03:04.349
Good day.

03:04.383 --> 03:05.883
Ahsoka.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.253
Go.

03:10.288 --> 03:12.289
Be with your friend, Ahsoka.

03:15.027 --> 03:16.027
[sighs]

03:16.061 --> 03:17.895
In ways, she is still very young.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.463
Indeed.

03:24.335 --> 03:25.435
Company?

03:25.469 --> 03:26.870
Sure.

03:26.904 --> 03:30.773
Every time I think about this,
I feel conflicted.

03:30.808 --> 03:35.411
It's hard not to let feelings
turn into attachment and pain.

03:35.445 --> 03:37.880
Ahsoka, have you ever wondered

03:37.914 --> 03:40.149
if it was right to ignore your emotions?

03:40.183 --> 03:41.984
My Master would say,

03:42.018 --> 03:44.987
"Our struggle as Jedi
is to move past them."

03:45.022 --> 03:46.622
You make it sound so easy.

03:46.656 --> 03:47.657
[chuckles]

03:47.691 --> 03:49.392
No, it isn't easy.

03:49.427 --> 03:50.694
But it's possible.

03:50.728 --> 03:51.862
Like, when we were stuck

03:51.896 --> 03:53.697
inside the battle tank on Geonosis,

03:53.732 --> 03:55.866
it was hard not to be afraid.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.968
Still, you and I got past it.

03:58.003 --> 04:00.538
And I guess we'll get past this.

04:00.572 --> 04:03.341
You've always been capable
of seeing things clearly.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.809
[chuckles]

04:04.844 --> 04:06.804
I guess I've fooled you
like I have everyone else.

04:06.812 --> 04:08.112
[comlink beeping]

04:08.146 --> 04:09.580
Yes, Master.

04:09.614 --> 04:11.548
Ahsoka, we're needed in the war room.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.951
It appears the Separatists
have mounted another attack.

04:13.985 --> 04:16.653
Coming, Master.

04:16.687 --> 04:20.055
Look, I have to believe
that one way or another,

04:20.091 --> 04:22.992
this woman's going to pay
for what she did.

04:23.027 --> 04:26.362
You shouldn't keep your Master waiting.

04:33.336 --> 04:36.772
We've uncovered
a Separatist plan of attack.

04:36.806 --> 04:39.908
We shall travel
to the Anoat system here,

04:39.943 --> 04:42.044
then move across to Saleucami.

04:42.078 --> 04:44.147
So far out of our way?

04:44.181 --> 04:47.584
Unfortunately, we must avoid
these neutral systems.

04:47.618 --> 04:49.218
Excuse me, Master Jedi.

04:49.253 --> 04:50.420
Yes, Admiral.

04:50.454 --> 04:52.088
Commander Tano,

04:52.123 --> 04:54.791
your presence is requested
by prisoner Letta Turmond.

04:54.825 --> 04:56.359
The prisoner from the hangar bombing?

04:56.393 --> 04:58.361
Why is she asking for Ahsoka?

04:58.396 --> 04:59.563
Not exactly sure.

04:59.597 --> 05:01.531
But Commander Tano is the only person

05:01.565 --> 05:03.366
the prisoner will speak to.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.536
I'll report back
with whatever I find out.

05:22.888 --> 05:24.889
[engines whooshing]

05:47.577 --> 05:48.877
Yes?

05:48.911 --> 05:49.911
I'm Commander Tano.

05:49.946 --> 05:52.147
Letta Turmond requested to see me.

05:52.181 --> 05:54.683
A lot of innocent people
died in that blast.

05:54.717 --> 05:56.251
Good job capturing her.

05:57.887 --> 05:59.121
All right, scan her.

06:02.091 --> 06:05.894
[scanner pinging]

06:05.928 --> 06:08.965
Leave your comlink and lightsabers here.

06:14.538 --> 06:16.172
Follow me.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.431
What do you want, Letta?

06:42.465 --> 06:44.800
I was told if I ever needed help,

06:44.834 --> 06:46.368
you were the Jedi to contact.

06:50.974 --> 06:52.975
Give us a minute, please.

06:56.613 --> 06:58.280
You don't have much time, Letta,

06:58.315 --> 07:00.616
so I suggest you get
whatever you have to say

07:00.651 --> 07:02.251
off your chest.

07:04.288 --> 07:07.557
The idea of feeding Jackar
the nano-droids was not mine.

07:07.592 --> 07:10.060
Why are you saying this now?

07:10.094 --> 07:11.995
Why didn't you reveal this before?

07:12.029 --> 07:14.297
Because my life is in danger.

07:14.332 --> 07:16.233
The person behind this
will be able to get to me

07:16.267 --> 07:18.368
unless you know the truth.

07:18.403 --> 07:20.705
Huh.
What's the truth?

07:20.739 --> 07:22.039
A Jedi.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.275
A Jedi showed me how to create the bomb

07:24.310 --> 07:26.344
and how to put
the nano-droids in.

07:26.378 --> 07:28.880
Why would a Jedi do this?

07:28.915 --> 07:31.917
There are some citizens
of the Republic, like myself,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.587
who believe the Jedi Order
is not what it used to be.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.722
The Jedi have become warmongers.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.557
They've become military weapons.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.692
And they're killing

07:39.726 --> 07:41.927
when they should be keeping the peace.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.263
One of these Jedi agreed with us.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.832
One of you wanted to make a statement

07:46.867 --> 07:49.601
and was willing to attack
your own order to do it.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.638
Who?

07:52.672 --> 07:55.140
If you protect me, I will tell you,

07:55.175 --> 07:58.210
because it is obvious to me
that I have been set up.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.647
Letta, you have to tell me
who is behind this.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.651
It's--

08:06.686 --> 08:07.686
Letta!

08:07.720 --> 08:08.720
Letta!

08:08.754 --> 08:09.788
Letta!

08:09.822 --> 08:11.890
Prisoner health critical,

08:11.924 --> 08:14.559
holding cell 173.

08:14.593 --> 08:17.161
Commander Fox, the prisoner.

08:17.196 --> 08:18.596
Follow me.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.300
[choking]

08:22.335 --> 08:23.335
Letta!

08:30.544 --> 08:33.346
I...
don't know what happened.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.715
Commander, she's dead.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.551
I can't say I blame you, Commander Tano.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.520
But all the same, you're under arrest.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.657
I...
No, no.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.692
I did not do this.

09:17.270 --> 09:19.595
Admiral Tarkin,
I don't know what happened.

09:19.899 --> 09:21.500
I went in the room to talk to Letta,

09:21.534 --> 09:23.969
and she said she was afraid of a Jedi.

09:26.273 --> 09:30.475
You don't have to tell me
any more, Commander Tano.

09:30.509 --> 09:31.743
I don't?

09:31.777 --> 09:32.570
No.

09:32.690 --> 09:34.946
There are recorders in every room.

09:36.815 --> 09:39.884
Curiously, the sound
isn't working on this one.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.508
It seems the Jedi
she was afraid of was you.

09:45.623 --> 09:48.025
I did not kill that woman.

09:48.059 --> 09:49.560
You were the only one there.

09:49.594 --> 09:52.004
I know that you were upset
when this woman

09:52.124 --> 09:54.275
was taken into custody by the military.

09:54.395 --> 09:55.632
That means nothing.

09:55.667 --> 09:56.900
I beg to differ.

09:57.286 --> 09:58.852
It was someone else, Admiral,

09:58.887 --> 10:00.854
someone I didn't see.

10:00.889 --> 10:02.456
You know that is very difficult

10:02.490 --> 10:04.291
for me to believe.

10:04.325 --> 10:06.393
This is a secure facility.

10:06.428 --> 10:09.563
We do not have
just anyone running about.

10:09.598 --> 10:11.999
And if there was someone else,

10:12.033 --> 10:14.669
why did you not sense them?

10:23.445 --> 10:26.548
I said my Padawan is in there.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.016
Now, step aside.

10:28.050 --> 10:29.818
General Skywalker,

10:29.852 --> 10:34.223
Admiral Tarkin has ordered
that no one be allowed in there.

10:34.257 --> 10:36.258
I don't care what she's accused of.

10:36.292 --> 10:38.560
Let me in.

10:42.799 --> 10:44.233
Sorry, sir.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.569
The admiral's orders stand.

10:46.603 --> 10:48.705
This is now a military operation

10:48.739 --> 10:51.107
and under his jurisdiction.

11:08.593 --> 11:09.994
[coughs]

11:19.004 --> 11:20.905
A key card.

11:20.939 --> 11:23.841
Master, I knew you wouldn't let me down.

11:35.221 --> 11:38.390
I wonder what you have planned.

11:48.502 --> 11:49.969
Oh, no.

11:50.003 --> 11:51.604
This does not look good.

12:00.013 --> 12:01.847
My lightsabers.

12:01.882 --> 12:05.818
[comlink beeping]

12:05.852 --> 12:07.253
Hello?

12:07.287 --> 12:08.787
Who is this?

12:08.821 --> 12:10.455
Why are you helping me?

12:12.925 --> 12:13.925
What's going on here?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.861
It wasn't me.

12:15.895 --> 12:19.664
[alarm blaring]

12:19.699 --> 12:20.765
Alert!
Alert!

12:20.800 --> 12:22.634
The Jedi prisoner has escaped.

12:26.472 --> 12:29.474
[droid speaking alien language]

12:40.386 --> 12:41.686
Commander Tano, stop!

12:45.858 --> 12:47.725
She's heading north
in the prison corridor.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.026
Cut her off!

12:49.061 --> 12:50.294
Copy that.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.516
Oh, no.

13:14.551 --> 13:16.352
[blaster firing]

13:19.723 --> 13:21.223
The suspect has killed three clones.

13:21.257 --> 13:22.324
Code red.

13:22.358 --> 13:25.093
If you see the target, shoot to kill.

13:25.127 --> 13:26.594
Belay that order, Commander Fox.

13:26.629 --> 13:28.597
She's killed troopers.

13:28.631 --> 13:30.132
I know Commander Tano.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.768
She would never do something like this.

13:32.802 --> 13:34.069
Then who did?

13:34.104 --> 13:36.138
Quiet!

13:36.172 --> 13:37.372
Ahsoka!

13:37.407 --> 13:39.308
It's me, Anakin.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.280
Stop running.

13:45.416 --> 13:47.150
You can't help me, Master.

13:47.184 --> 13:48.952
Someone's setting me up.

13:48.986 --> 13:51.021
I believe you, Ahsoka.

13:52.023 --> 13:54.724
But no one else will.

13:57.495 --> 13:59.496
Keep searching until we find her.

13:59.530 --> 14:00.697
Rex, call security.

14:00.731 --> 14:02.899
Tell them we need
to search the entire base.

14:02.933 --> 14:03.967
Now!

14:04.001 --> 14:05.068
[comlink beeps]

14:05.102 --> 14:06.536
General Skywalker has just issued

14:06.570 --> 14:09.339
an all-points bulletin
on Commander Ahsoka Tano.

14:09.373 --> 14:10.707
She's killed three clones

14:10.741 --> 14:14.076
and should be considered
armed and dangerous.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.600
The prisoner was just spotted
in the east wing,

14:32.632 --> 14:34.850
cell block 1218-11.

15:07.285 --> 15:10.288
[creature sniffing]

15:10.323 --> 15:13.425
[creature growling]

15:18.599 --> 15:20.432
[whistles] Come on, Grizzer.

15:20.466 --> 15:21.867
There's nothing here.

15:29.242 --> 15:30.409
There she is!

15:30.443 --> 15:32.578
Quick, stop her
before she gets to the ship!

15:37.818 --> 15:40.219
[blasters firing]

15:46.559 --> 15:49.295
[blasters firing]

15:53.767 --> 15:55.768
[explosion]

16:04.693 --> 16:06.874
All right, don't lose her.
We'll be right there.

16:06.994 --> 16:08.027
What's going on?

16:08.062 --> 16:08.847
We've found her.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.768
She's heading towards
the industrial pipeline.

16:10.798 --> 16:12.432
Set weapons to stun.

16:12.466 --> 16:13.633
I want her alive!

16:23.110 --> 16:25.110
[blaster firing]

16:58.443 --> 16:59.977
Do not shoot to kill.

17:00.012 --> 17:02.012
Do not shoot to kill!

17:02.047 --> 17:03.014
Try to box her in.

17:03.048 --> 17:04.147
Don't let her escape.

17:04.182 --> 17:06.050
Tell me what you see, Oddball.

17:19.696 --> 17:21.732
She's moving west
along the central viaduct.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.581
All right, we got her now.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.896
This will knock her off her feet.

17:52.930 --> 17:54.397
[blaster booms]

18:10.949 --> 18:12.983
Not so fast, Commander.

18:18.956 --> 18:21.791
[creatures growling]

18:35.406 --> 18:36.473
Ahsoka!

19:26.087 --> 19:27.087
[creature squawks]

20:12.733 --> 20:15.735
Ahsoka, what are you doing?

20:15.769 --> 20:18.371
You didn't even try to come and help me.

20:18.405 --> 20:20.039
They wouldn't let me in to talk to you.

20:20.073 --> 20:22.174
You could have if you tried.

20:22.209 --> 20:24.544
How would that look, Ahsoka, huh?

20:24.578 --> 20:25.745
Forcing my way in

20:25.780 --> 20:27.380
would've made you look even more guilty.

20:27.415 --> 20:29.582
I'm not guilty!

20:29.617 --> 20:31.985
Then we have to prove you're innocent.

20:32.019 --> 20:34.587
The only way we can do that
is by going back.

20:34.621 --> 20:36.722
I don't know who to trust.

20:36.756 --> 20:39.926
Listen, I would never
let anyone hurt you, Ahsoka,

20:39.960 --> 20:41.127
never.

20:41.161 --> 20:42.796
But you need to come back

20:42.830 --> 20:44.564
and make your case to the Council.

20:44.599 --> 20:46.133
No.

20:46.167 --> 20:50.370
I'm not going to take the fall
for something I didn't do!

20:50.405 --> 20:52.440
I am ordering you
to put down your lightsaber

20:52.474 --> 20:54.976
and come with me now!

20:55.010 --> 20:56.044
Trust me.

20:56.078 --> 20:58.647
General Skywalker, where are you?

20:58.681 --> 21:00.149
I do trust you.

21:00.183 --> 21:02.217
But you know as well as I do

21:02.252 --> 21:04.620
that no one else will believe me.

21:07.891 --> 21:11.449
Anakin, you have to trust me now.

21:11.569 --> 21:13.462
Ahsoka, I do trust you.

21:13.496 --> 21:15.163
I know you do.

21:16.439 --> 21:18.533
Wish me luck.
