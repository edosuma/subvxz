00:10.970 --> 00:12.931
<i>NARRATOR".
Morning in Gotham City.</i>

00:13.097 --> 00:19.604
<i>But a day that dawns brightly
is no guarantee against darkening disaster.</i>

00:21.981 --> 00:23.274
Olga.

00:31.449 --> 00:34.410
Olga. Olga, wait for me. Giddyap. Giddyap.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.913
Olga!

00:37.080 --> 00:39.165
It's the Cossacks again, sonny.

00:39.332 --> 00:42.627
Yes, ma'am.
But this time, they turned down Market Street.

00:42.794 --> 00:45.964
The only thing in that direction
is the Gotham City Radium Center.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.215
Radium Center?

00:47.382 --> 00:50.718
That sounds even more dangerous
than trying to cross this street.

00:56.558 --> 01:01.229
- Cossacks.
-Da, Cossacks, my little technicianski.

01:01.396 --> 01:03.731
Where is hot stuff being kept?

01:03.898 --> 01:06.818
"Hot stuff"? I don't know what you mean.

01:07.318 --> 01:11.990
Ossip, sharpen little technicianski's memory
with sword.

01:14.993 --> 01:17.662
Please, don't. I don't understand.

01:20.456 --> 01:23.918
What are you doing, Olga?
Light of my life, my little future wife.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.963
Forget rhymeski. She's hiding hot stuff.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.340
I don't know what she's talking about.

01:29.507 --> 01:33.678
"Hot stuff" is Cossack translation for radium,
my dear.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.972
Well, why didn't she say so?

01:36.139 --> 01:40.393
Well, I am saying so. Now, hand it over.
We want 2 pounds of it.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.479
-It's in the vault.
-Well, then open it...

01:43.646 --> 01:49.193
...or I will let Ossip here egg-speriment
with his technique on you.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.321
Yes, sir.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.037
-It's in there.
-Get it.

02:05.627 --> 02:08.420
Is cool. ls not hot.

02:08.588 --> 02:10.923
- Is trick.
-Oh, no. No, no, Olga. No.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.384
This is merely the lead case.

02:13.551 --> 02:18.139
The hot stuff is inside.
And it's plenty hot, I assure you.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.474
Here, I'll take that.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.351
Unh!

02:21.517 --> 02:23.311
Thank you.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.731
Carry on. Carry on, my Cossacks.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.403
Commissioner Gordon.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.072
What?

02:34.656 --> 02:36.908
Two pounds of radium?

02:37.075 --> 02:40.495
And you're sure it was the Cossacks?

02:41.746 --> 02:43.873
All right. Thank you.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.584
Not them Cossacks again, commissioner.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.086
I'm afraid so, Chief O'Hara.

02:48.252 --> 02:52.590
They've just stolen 2 pounds of radium
from the Gotham City Radium Center.

02:52.924 --> 02:54.676
Radium? What for?

02:56.094 --> 03:00.765
That's a question I intend to put
to the Caped Crusaders. Right now.

03:05.103 --> 03:07.897
The Batcomputer's none too frisky today,
Batman.

03:08.064 --> 03:11.693
Yes, it's possible a supply of radium
somewhere in the city has been moved.

03:11.859 --> 03:18.199
And as radio-sensitive as our machine is,
it just possibly could be affected by that.

03:18.366 --> 03:22.203
And it's lucky that you and Batgirl found us,
Alfred.

03:22.370 --> 03:26.749
Otherwise, Robin and Commissioner Gordon
might not be too frisky, either.

03:26.916 --> 03:30.128
Holy understatements, Batman.
We would've been in the soup for good.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.131
Yes, commissioner.

03:33.631 --> 03:37.468
Olga and Egghead have just stolen
2 pounds of radium, Batman.

03:37.844 --> 03:39.637
From the Gotham City Radium Center?

03:39.804 --> 03:41.472
Yes. Not 10 minutes ago.

03:42.140 --> 03:46.811
The radium there is type number six,
isotype 14...

03:46.978 --> 03:49.731
...worth about $500 an ounce,
commissioner.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.067
The entire theft amounts to only $16,000..

03:53.234 --> 03:57.572
...far below the usual scale
of an Olga-Egghead caper.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.990
That's what worries me.

03:59.157 --> 04:02.452
I'm afraid this is only the first step
in a much larger crime.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.495
We'll come right down.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.581
Let's go, Robin.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.872 --> 05:33.751
What possible purpose
could Olga and Egghead have...

05:33.918 --> 05:36.087
...for <i>2</i> pounds of radium, Batman?

05:36.254 --> 05:39.423
- I don't know, commissioner.
-What about the water supply, Batman?

05:39.590 --> 05:44.262
Right. Oh, that's a favorite trick
of Gotham City's arch-criminals, Boy Wonder.

05:44.554 --> 05:46.848
No, it would take at least 200 pounds
of radium...

05:47.014 --> 05:49.475
...to affect the city's water system,
Chief O'Hara.

05:49.642 --> 05:53.479
Perhaps they plan to construct
some sort of a diabolical weapon.

05:54.272 --> 05:56.607
No, the quantity they've stolen
is hardly enough...

05:56.774 --> 05:59.443
...to construct a weapon of any size,
Commissioner Gordon.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.779
Holy anagrams, what's the answer?

06:01.946 --> 06:05.867
I feel it won't be long until they themselves
provide us with a clue, Robin.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.786
Oh, I hope you're right, Batman.

06:08.953 --> 06:13.082
Oh, I can just feel them
radioactive gammas and betas...

06:13.249 --> 06:16.127
...crawling up on me right now. Ugh.

06:17.420 --> 06:23.593
<i>NARRATOR". And in the Gotham City Library,
Barbara Gordon has a weighty problem.</i>

06:23.968 --> 06:24.969
Unh!

06:25.136 --> 06:28.431
Talk about heavy reading, Barbara.
This thing must weigh 10 pounds.

06:28.598 --> 06:30.850
It's a rare book on paleontology, Petula.

06:31.017 --> 06:33.561
Professor Dactyl wanted me
to bring it to his office...

06:33.728 --> 06:35.813
...at Gotham City Museum of Natural History.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.774
You certainly know the ins and outs
of this library, Barbara.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.735
I didn't even know we had this book.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.446
Well, paleontology
used to be a hobby of mine.

06:43.613 --> 06:45.990
I'll take this to the professor
and come right back.

06:46.157 --> 06:49.243
- I shouldn't be gone more than half an hour.
-All right.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.677
Oh, hello, Miss Gordon.
I see you've brought my book.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.263
- Thank you, my dear.
-Don't mention it, professor.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.642
That's a very interesting fossil egg.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.019
Yes, a very interesting specimen.

07:15.311 --> 07:19.065
One of the very few intact fossil eggs
of that era.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.652
- Aren't you afraid someone will steal it?
-Steal it?

07:22.818 --> 07:25.196
Well, who would want to steal it, my dear?

07:25.363 --> 07:28.741
Well, there's a certain arch-criminal
who has a well-known penchant...

07:28.908 --> 07:31.619
...for stealing anything
even remotely connected with eggs.

07:32.161 --> 07:34.330
But it has no commercial value.

07:34.497 --> 07:38.960
An interesting scientific curio,
but hardly worth anything.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.753
Except to the paleontologist.

07:41.504 --> 07:44.882
Perhaps you'd like to see
one of our newest acquisitions.

07:45.049 --> 07:50.471
The fossilized thigh bone
of a female giant saber-toothed tiger...

07:50.638 --> 07:52.723
...from Outer Sverdlovia.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.476
Which is just outside Outer Mongolia.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.105
- I can't wait.
-Come along.

08:07.238 --> 08:08.823
Was hot behind fossil.

08:08.990 --> 08:12.493
Yes, was also enlightening, Olga. Heh, heh.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.580
Enlightening?
What means "enlightening," Eggski?

08:16.747 --> 08:19.792
Instructive, informative, my dear.

08:19.959 --> 08:23.587
That young lady with the professor
thought that I might steal...

08:23.754 --> 08:30.428
...the only egg-sisting Neosaurus egg
in the Western world. Heh, heh.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.097
Forty-million years old.

08:34.597 --> 08:39.937
Is probably stale, Eggski,
after 40 million years.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.605
Why bother to take it?

08:41.772 --> 08:44.232
You just leave the thinking to me, Olga.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.943
And me?

08:46.110 --> 08:48.779
You just look beautiful, my dear.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.824
Naughty Eggski.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.660
Sometimes you are such gallant.

08:54.827 --> 08:59.123
So now let's dispense with the flattery
and commence with the job, shall we?

09:01.792 --> 09:06.756
But why on earth would anyone want to steal
a Neosaurus egg, Barbara?

09:06.922 --> 09:11.052
I don't know, Daddy, but it's gone.
And I'm sure Egghead's the one who took it.

09:11.427 --> 09:13.387
I agree with you there, but why?

09:14.013 --> 09:15.973
Has he stolen anything else today?

09:16.932 --> 09:19.060
Well, as a matter of fact, yes, he has.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.229
He stole <i>2</i> pounds of radium
from the Gotham City Radium Center...

09:22.396 --> 09:23.731
...not more than an hour ago.

09:23.898 --> 09:26.984
By the way, Barbara,
this information is off the record, of course.

09:27.151 --> 09:28.486
I understand, Daddy.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.488
Thank you for reporting this, darling.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.657
And assure Professor Dactyl
that we will make every effort...

09:33.824 --> 09:36.285
...to get his egg back for him.

09:36.452 --> 09:37.995
Bye.

09:38.829 --> 09:43.250
Why on earth would anyone want to steal
a Neosaurus egg, commissioner?

09:43.417 --> 09:47.171
That seems to be the question of the day,
Chief O'Hara.

09:47.338 --> 09:51.008
- Do you have an answer, Batman?
-Unfortunately, no.

09:51.175 --> 09:54.637
But I'm sure this theft is connected
with his earlier theft of the radium.

09:54.804 --> 09:56.013
But how, Batman?

09:56.180 --> 09:59.225
I think a little session with the Batcomputer
will give us a clue.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.353
We'll be in touch, commissioner.
Let's go, Robin.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.691
Think they can crack it, commissioner?

10:07.858 --> 10:10.236
If they can't, who can?

10:10.402 --> 10:11.862
Sure and that's the truth.

10:18.661 --> 10:22.414
I'm afraid we're not going to get much help
from the Batcomputer, Robin.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.167
It can't go back to prehistoric times.

10:25.334 --> 10:30.131
This is a problem
for good old-fashioned brain power.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.966
We'll have to think it out.

10:32.133 --> 10:35.427
<i>NARRATOR". While Batman and Robin puzzle
over the problem in the Batcave...</i>

10:35.886 --> 10:40.641
<i>...another mind works on the same problem
at the Gotham City Library.</i>

10:41.100 --> 10:45.646
Robin, do you remember
a Professor Willis Grimes?

10:45.813 --> 10:48.941
That radiologist who stayed at Wayne Manor
about six months ago?

10:49.108 --> 10:51.110
Yes. He was here for a convention.

10:51.277 --> 10:55.573
And at the same time, he was working on
a new technique of irradiation.

10:56.282 --> 10:59.660
I remember something about it,
but it was pretty technical stuff.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.328
I didn't understand much of it.

11:01.579 --> 11:04.290
Yes, it was complex, but I think...

11:04.456 --> 11:07.251
I think it may be the clue we're looking for.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.838
- Can you get in touch with him?
-Unfortunately, no.

11:11.005 --> 11:14.175
Professor Grimes is out of the country
right now.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.635
But he did publish an article...

11:16.802 --> 11:21.932
...in <i>the Southeastern Regional Journal
of Applied Radiology.</i>

11:25.477 --> 11:29.940
- Yes, sir?
-Alfred, can you locate the most recent issue...

11:30.107 --> 11:33.485
...of <i>the Southeastern Journal
of Applied Radiology?</i>

11:33.652 --> 11:38.073
There should be an article in it
by a Professor Willis Grimes.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.577
Just a second, sir. I'll see if I can find it.

11:43.412 --> 11:46.832
That's it. Professor Grimes.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.377
Petula, does the library subscribe...

11:50.544 --> 11:53.631
...to <i>the Southeastern Regional Journal
of Applied Radiology?</i>

11:53.964 --> 11:55.341
We don't get it anymore.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.636
We had to cancel it last year
when the city council cut our budget.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.304
That's right, I forgot.

12:00.471 --> 12:04.433
I've got to get hold of a copy of it.
Who in Gotham City would have it?

12:04.850 --> 12:08.145
The only person in Gotham City
who subscribes to more periodicals...

12:08.312 --> 12:11.982
...than the public library
is millionaire Bruce Wayne.

12:12.775 --> 12:17.112
Excuse me, Barbara. I have someone
waiting for this copy of Robert Frost.

12:24.245 --> 12:25.537
I've located it, sir.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.499
What is the title of Professor Grimes' article?

12:30.167 --> 12:34.171
Just one second, sir. Could you hold on?
The other line is ringing.

12:36.382 --> 12:37.508
Bruce Wayne residence.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.510
Alfred, this is Barbara Gordon.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.682
<i>Does Bruce</i> Wayne <i>receive the</i> Southeastern
Regional Journal of Applied Radiology?

12:44.848 --> 12:47.685
Why, yes. Yes, he does, Miss Gordon.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.186
Oh, thank goodness.

12:49.353 --> 12:52.815
There's an article in the latest issue of it
written by a Professor Grimes.

12:52.982 --> 12:54.942
Can you give me the title of that article?

12:55.985 --> 12:57.027
I believe I can.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.114
Alfred, this is just between you and me.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.866
Of course, Miss Gordon.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.578
I have it here, sir.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.872
I have it here, miss.

13:09.290 --> 13:10.582
The title of the article is:

13:11.333 --> 13:17.923
"Revitalizing Fossil Forms By The Use
of High-Energy Radioactive Energy Sources."

13:18.090 --> 13:20.467
- Thank you, Alfred.
-Thank you, Alfred.

13:20.926 --> 13:25.723
You're welcome, sir, miss.

13:31.478 --> 13:36.066
You think Egghead plans
to revitalize that fossil egg and hatch it?

13:36.233 --> 13:38.402
Exactly, Robin.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.240
But that's impossible.

14:12.478 --> 14:16.273
You are going to hatch
40-million-year-old egg?

14:16.440 --> 14:17.733
It's impossible, Eggski.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.363
That's what they told Fulton, Edison,
and Casanova, Olga.

14:22.529 --> 14:27.117
All we have to do is pour enough radiation into
that egg, and I'm sure we can get it to hatch.

14:27.284 --> 14:31.455
Of course, Grimes' theory hasn't been
tested yet, but I'm sure it'll work. Heh, heh.

14:31.622 --> 14:35.000
And we will have real live Neosaurus.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.087
Yes, our very own.
We'll control Gotham City...

14:38.253 --> 14:40.798
...and that ought to be enough dowry
even for you, Olga.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.050
And then finally, we can get married.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.348
You hatch egg, I will hatch wedding.

14:49.515 --> 14:52.643
Egg-scelent, Olga. Egg-scelent.

14:52.810 --> 14:58.107
And think what those Dynamic Dimwits will do
when they are faced with my Neosaurus.

14:58.273 --> 15:02.027
Did you know
that the Neosaurus has <i>2562</i> teeth?

15:02.194 --> 15:03.987
Not counting wisdom teeth.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.156
What is such a creature eating, Eggski?

15:06.323 --> 15:11.161
Well, I'm planning
a three-course meal for it, yes.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.539
Batman, Robin, and Batgirl.

15:13.705 --> 15:17.501
And for dessert,
Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.795
- Marvelous.
-Ha, ha, ha.

15:20.379 --> 15:23.424
This Bat-geiger counter will not only pick up
radiation, Robin...

15:23.590 --> 15:26.176
...but will tell us
from which direction it's coming.

15:26.343 --> 15:30.139
Now that we've adjusted it to react
only to the radium source stolen by Egghead...

15:30.305 --> 15:34.101
...we should be able to track down
his headquarters in nothing flat.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.687
- Why didn't we think of this before, Batman?
-Hm.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.398
Hindsight is often better than foresight,
old chum.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.150
Let's go.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.596
You are hearing anything, Eggski?

16:10.762 --> 16:13.765
Nothing yet. We'll give it another dose.

16:13.932 --> 16:19.354
I'm gonna keep zapping it until it hatches.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.744
- I'm getting a reading.
-What direction?

16:33.911 --> 16:35.996
- Northeast. Very close.
-Right.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.720
Batgirl, how did you learn about the thefts?

16:51.887 --> 16:53.764
I have my own sources, Batman.

16:54.097 --> 16:57.809
So I see. And you decided
on the same method of detection as we did.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.438
My counter indicates
the source of radiation is in that warehouse.

17:01.939 --> 17:02.981
So does ours.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.486
Well, I guess hindsight is often better
than foresight.

17:07.653 --> 17:11.156
I suggest we pay them a visit, unannounced.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.617
I've always liked crashing parties.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.838
You are swimming up blind alley, Eggski.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.800
- This is all waste of time.
-What do you know about it, Olga?

17:29.967 --> 17:33.428
I'll tell you, I heard something stirring
inside of this shell.

17:33.595 --> 17:39.810
- No kidding?
-Yes, a few more bursts and we'll hatch it. Ha, ha.

17:44.273 --> 17:45.649
Hatch this, Egghead.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.657
- Little red mal'chik and Batgirl.
- No.

18:33.864 --> 18:34.948
Bring her here.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.662
All right, that's enough, Boy Wonder.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.210
That was a slimy trick, you rotten egg.

18:47.377 --> 18:51.798
Of course, Batgirl.
I have a patent on slimy tricks.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.717
Wait a minute, Eggski.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.761
Where is <i>malen'kiy</i> Batushka?

18:56.178 --> 18:59.514
Batman?
He was probably too afraid of me to show up.

18:59.681 --> 19:04.186
Only these foolhardy youngsters
are impolitic enough to do that.

19:04.353 --> 19:07.439
Does not sound like Batushka I know.

19:07.606 --> 19:10.651
That's because you don't know him
as well as I do, Olga.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.737
At heart, he is a coward in the egg-streme.

19:13.904 --> 19:18.325
Batman has more courage in his little finger than
you have in your whole cowardly body, you--

19:18.492 --> 19:23.080
Quiet, Wonder Midget,
or I'll have you cut off permanently.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.250
Now you all are about to witness...

19:27.417 --> 19:30.754
...one of my greatest triumphs.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.297
Here.

19:32.464 --> 19:36.843
You will observe
a wonder of modern science.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.513
One more burst of radiation...

19:39.680 --> 19:45.602
...and that egg will yield
a 40-million-year-old Neosaurus.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.731
A hungry Neosaurus, my little friends.

20:01.535 --> 20:04.121
I hear it. I hear it.

20:04.287 --> 20:07.624
The Neosaurus is going to hatch.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.629
Oh...

20:20.637 --> 20:22.055
Oh!

20:27.686 --> 20:30.021
Calm down now, little Neosaurus.
Calm down.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.649
I'm your daddy. I hatched you.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.819
You wouldn't wanna hurt your daddy now,
would you?

20:39.489 --> 20:43.034
I'm your daddy. Olga and I are your friends.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.327
Aren't we, Olga?

20:45.704 --> 20:46.747
Yes.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.335
Eat those two. They're young and tender.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.504
- Da, of course.
-Yum, yum.

21:02.763 --> 21:06.516
Lock the doors, Chief O'Hara. Lock us in.

21:13.356 --> 21:17.652
Begorra, I never thought I'd see the likes of him
begging to be locked up.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.112
Take it away.

21:28.830 --> 21:33.376
If we attack it from different sides, Batgirl,
we may be able to subdue it.

21:38.423 --> 21:43.053
Though personally, I think it would rather eat
peanut-butter sandwiches than Gothamites.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.805
Peanut-butter sandwiches?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.598
That's right, Batgirl.

21:49.059 --> 21:52.896
You know your Neosauruses well, Robin.
Peanut-butter sandwiches, it is.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.066
What an ingenious trick, Batman.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.777
Not so ingenious, Batgirl.

21:58.944 --> 22:01.822
It's impossible to hatch
an egg 40 million years old...

22:01.988 --> 22:06.117
...but Egghead didn't believe that.
So I used his disbelief against him.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.744
But why, Batman?

22:07.911 --> 22:11.081
Too many Bessarovian Cossacks
around here, Robin.

22:11.248 --> 22:14.459
If I'd joined you in the fight,
some of them might have been injured.

22:14.626 --> 22:19.339
So I arranged for Chief O'Hara to have this
building surrounded. I used my costume to...

22:21.424 --> 22:24.845
...frighten them into surrendering en masse.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.596
Boy, I'll say.

22:26.972 --> 22:30.809
What about that burst of radiation
that hit the egg when you were inside it?

22:30.976 --> 22:33.436
I was able to protect myself
from the radiation...

22:33.603 --> 22:37.941
...by coating the inside of my costume
with a thin lead shielding.

22:38.441 --> 22:42.946
And now that Olga and Egghead
are safely behind iron bars, Robin...

22:43.363 --> 22:46.616
...they should have plenty of time
to study their paleontology.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.911
She's gone again.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.914
For once, Batman, let's follow her.

22:53.290 --> 22:58.503
Well, Robin, with my head
sticking out of this Neosaurus costume...

22:59.170 --> 23:04.384
...I might not appear
like an ordinary run-of-the-mill crime-fighter.

23:08.138 --> 23:12.267
You know who was inside that Neosaurus egg?
Batman.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.186
- He sure turns up in some weird places.
- Heh, heh.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.646
But how did you know this?

23:16.813 --> 23:19.149
You can't keep a thing like that a secret,
Bruce.

23:19.316 --> 23:22.402
The whole town's talking
about the Caped Crusaders' latest coup.

23:22.569 --> 23:26.823
But how could Batman have gotten
in a Neosaurus egg?

23:26.990 --> 23:31.119
Apparently, he hatched his own little plot,
Chief O'Hara.

23:33.663 --> 23:34.831
Daddy.

23:37.167 --> 23:40.545
Pardon me.
Do have some of my birthday cake.

23:42.297 --> 23:43.965
Hello?

23:44.132 --> 23:45.467
Skip Parker.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.469
I'm out at Gotham Point, Barbara.

23:47.636 --> 23:50.347
It looks like the surf's really gonna be up
in the morning.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.098
Is there any chance of joining me?

23:52.515 --> 23:56.019
Oh, I'd love to. And I don't have to be at work
at the library till noon.

23:56.186 --> 24:00.148
Good. We can catch
some really wild combers out here.

24:00.732 --> 24:03.068
Great. Bye.

24:04.027 --> 24:07.781
<i>NARRATOR". But what else is up at Gotham Point
besides the surf?</i>

24:08.573 --> 24:12.118
<i>What else is wild besides the combers?</i>

24:16.539 --> 24:18.750
<i>Not that heartless hodad, the Joker.</i>

24:18.917 --> 24:21.252
- Trouble, Joker?
-Oh, none, Riptide.

24:21.419 --> 24:24.089
With the aid of this little
two-way hot-dog transmitter...

24:24.255 --> 24:28.218
...I shall shortly be king of the surf
at Gotham Point. Ha, ha, ha.

24:28.551 --> 24:32.973
<i>NARRATOR". Will he? Will this green-haired
gremlin take over the world of surfing...</i>

24:33.139 --> 24:35.100
<i>...or will he wind up in the soup?</i>

24:35.266 --> 24:39.604
<i>There's only one way to find out.
Watch the next episode.</i>
