01:54.666 --> 01:56.713
Come on, Mr. Burns,
keep moving.

01:56.714 --> 01:59.240
We can't leave work till you do.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.135
Aw, no.

02:02.136 --> 02:04.606
He's talking to
that mailroom guy.

02:04.607 --> 02:06.072
I hope he's not telling
that stupid story

02:06.073 --> 02:07.883
about hang gliding again.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.048
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

02:17.877 --> 02:18.946
Listen carefully.

02:18.948 --> 02:20.590
I have taken your wife hostage.

02:20.623 --> 02:21.732
If you don't have a wife,

02:21.739 --> 02:23.151
I have kidnapped your brother.

02:23.162 --> 02:24.579
Nod if you understand.

02:25.699 --> 02:27.500
Now back away from Burns

02:27.507 --> 02:29.502
and I will let your dog live.

02:31.956 --> 02:32.722
Good.

02:32.728 --> 02:35.872
Now stop and dance
like a happy prospector.

02:37.025 --> 02:38.271
Happier.

02:39.566 --> 02:40.551
Happier!

02:42.796 --> 02:43.760
Happier!

02:46.795 --> 02:49.073
Homer, we want to get him
away from Burns.

02:49.075 --> 02:49.871
Oh, right.

02:49.976 --> 02:50.680
Just leave.

02:50.747 --> 02:51.892
But kick like
a Rockette.

03:01.358 --> 03:02.261
- Woo!
- Yes!

03:02.298 --> 03:03.223
We're free!

03:03.228 --> 03:05.180
Empty apartment
here I come!

03:05.635 --> 03:06.812
Set the table, Marge.

03:06.818 --> 03:07.891
I can already taste

03:07.898 --> 03:09.543
those deep-fried pork chops.

03:09.687 --> 03:11.502
Don't you remember what today is?

03:11.517 --> 03:13.251
When you ask me that

03:13.257 --> 03:14.562
it's never good.

03:14.568 --> 03:16.092
It's the first
of the month.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.551
The day you promised
to start your new diet.

03:19.475 --> 03:21.870
I'm just really worried
about your weight.

03:22.066 --> 03:24.312
Bart says that we got a call from NASA,

03:24.387 --> 03:26.063
and your gravity is pulling

03:26.067 --> 03:27.931
satellites out of their orbits.

03:27.935 --> 03:29.621
Marge, that was a joke.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.283
But it comes from
a true place.

03:32.298 --> 03:33.092
Oh!

03:33.328 --> 03:35.343
Well, if I'm going
to start a diet,

03:35.347 --> 03:36.763
this is my last chance

03:36.768 --> 03:38.920
to eat all the crap I love.

03:44.945 --> 03:47.153
I think I'll miss
you most of all,

03:47.158 --> 03:49.480
Captain Corn Dog
Schnitzel Palace.

03:49.536 --> 03:51.081
No tears, Homer.

03:52.457 --> 03:54.210
<i>I'm lost in a crowd</i>

03:54.386 --> 03:58.050
<i>And I'm hungry
like the wolf</i>

03:58.178 --> 03:59.831
<i>Straddle the line,</i>

03:59.885 --> 04:01.920
<i>in discord and rhyme</i>

04:01.927 --> 04:06.293
<i>And I'm hungry
like the wolf.</i>

04:10.435 --> 04:12.003
Can't let Marge see this.

04:12.438 --> 04:13.390
Thank you!

04:13.997 --> 04:16.560
A drive-up trash can.

04:16.596 --> 04:18.382
This must be how the rich

04:18.387 --> 04:20.089
toss out their gold.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.560
And as long as I'm cleaning out

04:21.565 --> 04:22.923
the family chariot...

04:23.457 --> 04:24.463
Cups...

04:24.837 --> 04:26.012
newspapers...

04:26.636 --> 04:27.602
bottles...

04:28.325 --> 04:29.433
tricycle...

04:29.896 --> 04:31.391
lawn chair...

04:31.957 --> 04:33.451
un-cashed checks.

04:36.227 --> 04:38.842
Hmm, "Dispose of properly."

04:38.847 --> 04:40.611
Aw, this book is too hard.

04:46.716 --> 04:48.641
And now for a victory cigar.

04:53.975 --> 04:54.873
Thank you!

05:01.628 --> 05:06.313
<i>And I'm hungry
like the wolf.</i>

05:13.978 --> 05:15.991
The calamity in our Fast-Food District

05:15.995 --> 05:17.871
destroyed 37 restaurants rated

05:17.876 --> 05:19.191
"awful" to "mediocre."

05:19.198 --> 05:20.320
And put these beloved

05:20.327 --> 05:22.091
mascots out on the street.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.810
I told myself

05:24.815 --> 05:26.370
I'd stay strong.

05:28.347 --> 05:30.643
There, there,
Cheesy McMayor.

05:30.648 --> 05:32.450
No one likes weepy meat.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.903
I can't stand to see a

05:33.907 --> 05:35.303
grown burger cry.

05:35.318 --> 05:36.560
We must rebuild

05:36.567 --> 05:38.320
Fast Food Boulevard!

05:39.668 --> 05:41.162
I don't know about you,

05:41.175 --> 05:42.740
but I don't want to
live in a future

05:42.756 --> 05:44.551
where food is brought by

05:44.687 --> 05:45.922
"waiters..."

05:45.927 --> 05:47.071
where the chairs aren't

05:47.076 --> 05:48.590
attached to the tables...

05:48.598 --> 05:50.480
and where I can't ditch my kids

05:50.488 --> 05:52.441
in a pit of dirty balls.

05:52.456 --> 05:54.333
I say we rebuild the

05:54.346 --> 05:55.541
Fast-Food District

05:55.547 --> 05:57.731
bigger and better than ever!

05:59.665 --> 06:01.530
To raise the money,
we'll need a bond issue.

06:01.537 --> 06:02.610
But won't that just shift

06:02.618 --> 06:04.240
the burden to your children?

06:04.257 --> 06:05.413
No, you idiot.

06:05.428 --> 06:06.412
We just pay for it with

06:06.415 --> 06:07.811
another bond issue.

06:07.818 --> 06:10.163
Let her figure out
someone to dump it on.

06:11.485 --> 06:12.921
Then it's decided

06:12.927 --> 06:14.930
the bond issue will be part of our next

06:14.935 --> 06:15.943
scheduled election,

06:15.948 --> 06:18.250
the Springfield presidential primary.

06:18.256 --> 06:19.782
But that's not till next June.

06:19.785 --> 06:21.751
In that case, I hereby move

06:21.756 --> 06:24.063
the election up to next Tuesday.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.732
That means the Springfield presidential

06:27.746 --> 06:29.751
primary will be first in the nation.

06:29.755 --> 06:31.592
Even earlier than New Hampshire.

06:31.596 --> 06:32.321
Uh-oh,

06:32.326 --> 06:34.431
they're going to be cheesed.

06:36.448 --> 06:38.651
Providing cheap liquor to
Massachusetts teens for 200 years.

06:41.186 --> 06:43.020
As they day of the primary nears,

06:43.028 --> 06:45.032
this race is as wide open as a

06:45.035 --> 06:47.290
hobo's mouthat a pie-flinging contest.

06:47.295 --> 06:48.793
What do you New Hampshirites think

06:48.797 --> 06:51.021
of the current crop of
presidential candidates?

06:51.028 --> 06:52.872
Well, Mr. Rather,

06:52.876 --> 06:54.131
the way I see it,

06:54.136 --> 06:56.281
as my father always said,

06:56.296 --> 06:57.531
"The way I look at it...."

06:57.537 --> 06:58.662
Dan, breaking news.

06:58.665 --> 06:59.843
Springfield just moved its primary

06:59.848 --> 07:01.193
a week ahead of New Hampshire's.

07:01.198 --> 07:02.392
Now it's the first one.

07:02.395 --> 07:03.730
Sweet mother of Murrow.

07:03.805 --> 07:05.761
off to Springfield, people.

07:05.766 --> 07:06.981
Come on, folks, move it.

07:06.998 --> 07:08.953
Grandma was slow, but she was old.

07:08.957 --> 07:10.153
You have no excuse.

07:10.158 --> 07:11.022
Into the truck!

07:16.606 --> 07:18.163
To Springfield.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.311
Which Springfield?

07:19.317 --> 07:20.613
The one the Simpsons live in.

07:20.937 --> 07:23.303
Eh, looks like everyone's gone

07:23.317 --> 07:24.640
but the cashier.

07:24.647 --> 07:26.483
Time to make our move.

07:29.045 --> 07:31.283
Nice knitting on these masks, Martha.

07:31.408 --> 07:33.093
Now that you've said my name

07:33.098 --> 07:34.480
I have to kill him.

07:59.633 --> 08:02.222
With Springfield's primary
now first in the nation,

08:02.239 --> 08:04.501
our humble city is
overrun with candidates,

08:04.502 --> 08:07.259
newshounds, spin doctors,
hacks, flacks, Russerts,

08:07.269 --> 08:09.812
Blitzers and even the occasional voter.

08:09.816 --> 08:11.002
Sir, do you have a preference?

08:11.006 --> 08:12.490
Yeah, I like girls, fruit loop.

08:12.995 --> 08:14.692
Are you a registered voter?

08:14.737 --> 08:15.782
I'm a registered...

08:16.176 --> 08:17.512
something.

08:17.817 --> 08:20.160
This election is on every channel.

08:20.166 --> 08:20.961
Come on, Marge.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.400
It's primary fever.

08:22.406 --> 08:23.021
Catch it!

08:23.086 --> 08:24.761
That's what you said about yellow fever,

08:24.765 --> 08:26.002
and that was no fun.

08:26.008 --> 08:27.933
I think it's exciting,
Springfield is the

08:27.936 --> 08:29.691
center of the political universe.

08:29.696 --> 08:31.771
I feel like a pundit in a think tank!

08:31.776 --> 08:33.471
Think tank, eh?

08:33.476 --> 08:34.503
Hmm.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.831
Now let's consider World Bank lending

08:37.836 --> 08:39.602
policy towards Micronesia.

08:42.888 --> 08:43.303
What?

08:43.357 --> 08:44.942
I'm not allowed to get one right?

08:48.665 --> 08:50.083
I like you newsies.

08:50.085 --> 08:52.150
You really lap up the sauce.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.113
Do you have Internet access?

08:54.128 --> 08:55.461
Sure thing, mouse pad.

08:55.478 --> 08:56.391
Ten bucks.

09:03.248 --> 09:04.423
Knock yourself out.

09:06.908 --> 09:09.272
This is Jon Stewart
reporting from Springfield.

09:09.335 --> 09:10.670
Do I need to say my name?

09:10.795 --> 09:11.862
People know me, right?

09:12.155 --> 09:13.183
Know it's just cable, but...

09:13.467 --> 09:14.132
You know what?

09:14.137 --> 09:15.111
I'm not gonna worry about it.

09:15.115 --> 09:15.831
I gonna just...

09:18.046 --> 09:18.831
Great. Now I'm worried.

09:18.835 --> 09:21.101
Hey, hey,it's Jon Stewart,

09:21.105 --> 09:23.870
everyone's favorite political funnyman!

09:23.878 --> 09:25.292
Hey, Krusty!

09:25.298 --> 09:27.371
Haven't seen you since
you bailed on that benefit.

09:27.376 --> 09:29.323
Yeah, well, I really didn't

09:29.326 --> 09:30.933
believe in the cause.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.361
Well, Krusty's Kids sure missed ya.

09:33.386 --> 09:35.793
Yeah, they're great.

09:35.807 --> 09:36.843
A little clingy...

09:36.846 --> 09:37.491
But anyway,

09:37.498 --> 09:39.743
this Springfield primary election

09:39.745 --> 09:41.340
pretty crazy, huh?

09:41.346 --> 09:42.452
Yeah, it sure is.

09:42.456 --> 09:46.081
With many comic
elements, such as, uh...?

09:46.467 --> 09:47.761
You know, if you ask me...

09:47.766 --> 09:50.840
there's more hot air
here than there is at...

09:51.587 --> 09:52.830
Are you writing this down?

09:52.837 --> 09:54.262
Nah, this is somethin' else.

09:54.296 --> 09:55.092
So, uh,

09:55.097 --> 09:58.133
where is there less
hot air than here?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.450
Albuquerque Balloon Festival?

10:01.458 --> 10:02.973
Rush Limbaugh' s sweatpants?

10:02.978 --> 10:03.620
Krusty,

10:03.636 --> 10:05.353
you're obviously fishing for jokes so

10:05.358 --> 10:06.563
you can steal them.

10:06.566 --> 10:07.290
No!

10:07.438 --> 10:09.440
That's ridiculous!

10:09.446 --> 10:11.313
More ridiculous than that place

10:11.318 --> 10:13.081
with all the hot air,

10:13.148 --> 10:14.020
which is...

10:14.296 --> 10:15.722
Well, I'll thank you to keep

10:15.726 --> 10:17.801
my zingers out of your mouth.

10:17.806 --> 10:18.861
I'm gonna try and remember you

10:18.867 --> 10:20.651
the way you used to be.

10:21.148 --> 10:23.111
But I've always been terrible!

10:24.957 --> 10:26.821
With me here to comment on today's

10:26.827 --> 10:29.423
Democratic debate is
Andrea Crowney of CNN,

10:29.425 --> 10:31.810
Dumont Evans of Slate.com

10:31.828 --> 10:32.963
and Ron Lehar,

10:32.968 --> 10:34.430
a print journalist

10:34.435 --> 10:36.152
from the Washington Post.

10:37.355 --> 10:39.441
Your medium is dying!

10:39.447 --> 10:40.172
Nelson!

10:40.178 --> 10:41.342
But it is!

10:41.345 --> 10:43.500
There's being right,
and there's being nice.

10:48.286 --> 10:51.191
Thank you all for coming
to our focus group.

10:51.197 --> 10:53.182
Today we're going to show you commercial

10:53.195 --> 10:54.963
from the Republican candidates.

10:54.968 --> 10:56.853
We'd like your honest opinions.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.511
This punch is too sweet.

10:58.515 --> 11:00.242
your blouse makes you look fat.

11:00.246 --> 11:02.053
Opinions about the ads.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.382
I live in that place!

11:05.217 --> 11:08.441
Who should America elect in 2008?

11:08.697 --> 11:10.642
<i>Former governor Vincent Aleppo</i>

11:10.647 --> 11:11.991
<i>said in the New York Times,</i>

11:11.998 --> 11:14.283
<i>"I will protect the nation
from attack."</i>

11:14.288 --> 11:15.493
<i>He's got my vote.</i>

11:15.496 --> 11:18.623
<i>But in that same issue
of the New York Times,</i>

11:18.628 --> 11:20.742
<i>they also printed an article about</i>

11:20.747 --> 11:23.782
<i>terrorist leader
Nussaf Al Mustaffi.</i>

11:23.786 --> 11:25.601
Dear God, what have I done?

11:25.605 --> 11:27.081
<i>"And you shall judge them</i>

11:27.088 --> 11:29.153
<i>by the company they keep."</i>

11:37.446 --> 11:38.612
Mm, my god!

11:38.657 --> 11:39.942
They're going steady!

11:39.946 --> 11:41.450
Did everyone see that?!

11:42.948 --> 11:44.700
So, what do we think?

11:44.706 --> 11:46.472
Well, I thought every part
of it was good,

11:46.478 --> 11:47.551
but overall, I hated it.

11:47.556 --> 11:49.211
I feel exactly the opposite,

11:49.217 --> 11:49.943
but the same.

11:49.946 --> 11:51.502
That was the best milkshake

11:51.508 --> 11:52.873
ad I've ever seen.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.262
It makes me wanna
want a milkshake!

11:57.568 --> 11:59.783
The top fifth is consuming

11:59.788 --> 12:02.322
60% of our nation's ressources

12:02.328 --> 12:04.351
while the bottom two-fifths

12:04.368 --> 12:06.253
is consuming one eighth.

12:06.255 --> 12:08.163
Hence my campaign slogan,

12:08.168 --> 12:10.523
"End quintile disparity".

12:10.526 --> 12:12.122
Look, we all care about

12:12.128 --> 12:13.630
quintile disparity,

12:13.638 --> 12:15.370
but the Democrats can't win

12:15.376 --> 12:17.090
with another prissy brainiac.

12:17.096 --> 12:18.851
Thank you, Senator Winnergill.

12:19.266 --> 12:21.350
That's Whiner-girl.

12:31.097 --> 12:33.052
Honey, how many of this signs

12:33.056 --> 12:34.402
do I have to put up?

12:35.906 --> 12:37.252
25 more?!

12:37.257 --> 12:40.303
What did I ever do to
you to deserve this?

12:42.876 --> 12:44.823
You're never gonna
let that go, are you?

12:45.937 --> 12:46.913
Oh, my god!

12:46.918 --> 12:48.431
That family is undecided!

12:48.437 --> 12:50.693
Undecided!

13:07.206 --> 13:10.251
I wonder who that could be...

13:15.636 --> 13:17.031
Family values!

13:17.035 --> 13:18.223
Vanishing middle class!

13:18.228 --> 13:18.993
Cut and run!

13:18.997 --> 13:21.392
Terrorists win! Terrorists win!

13:21.395 --> 13:23.251
Stop all this pandering!

13:23.258 --> 13:24.743
If you haven't sprung from her

13:24.745 --> 13:26.251
or aren't married to my loins,

13:26.258 --> 13:28.033
get the hell out
of this house!

13:33.408 --> 13:35.333
You too, Fred Thompson.

13:35.337 --> 13:36.963
But I was in Die Hard.

13:37.596 --> 13:39.183
Die Hard Two!

13:44.988 --> 13:46.643
Is everyone here
as sick of those

13:46.648 --> 13:48.430
stupid politicians as I am?

13:49.505 --> 13:50.662
What about the media?

13:50.668 --> 13:51.992
They're not covering the issues.

13:51.995 --> 13:53.692
They just want to declare
a frontrunner

13:53.697 --> 13:55.152
and go back to their mansions.

13:56.508 --> 13:58.451
Who wants to abolish
democracy forever?

13:58.455 --> 13:59.282
Show of hands.

13:59.337 --> 14:00.530
I could really go for some

14:00.535 --> 14:01.883
kind of military dictator

14:01.887 --> 14:03.381
like, uh, Juan Peron.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.501
When he disappeared ya,

14:04.518 --> 14:05.850
you stayed disappeared.

14:05.856 --> 14:07.232
Plus his wife was Madonna.

14:07.236 --> 14:08.570
What are we gonna do?

14:08.575 --> 14:09.932
We can't not vote,

14:09.938 --> 14:11.282
nobody does that.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.040
Why don't we all pick the most

14:13.048 --> 14:15.543
ridiculous candidate
and write him in?

14:15.545 --> 14:17.123
You mean Dennis Kucinich?

14:17.128 --> 14:19.060
Hey! I'm right here!

14:19.065 --> 14:19.952
Oh, sorry.

14:19.958 --> 14:22.073
No, no. This candidate has to

14:22.077 --> 14:23.743
be unbelievably ridiculous.

14:23.746 --> 14:24.741
Chief Wiggum!

14:25.158 --> 14:25.840
No.

14:25.958 --> 14:27.592
But you're close.

14:27.796 --> 14:29.350
Roll over, Anne Coulter,

14:29.355 --> 14:31.520
and tell James Carville the news:

14:31.526 --> 14:32.691
Springfield voters have

14:32.695 --> 14:33.852
overwhelmingly rejected

14:33.856 --> 14:35.502
the major candidates of both parties

14:35.505 --> 14:36.971
in favor of a write-in:

14:36.976 --> 14:39.182
eight-year-old Ralph Wiggum.

14:39.185 --> 14:41.273
Shockingly, this new face is now favored

14:41.278 --> 14:43.671
by 53% of likely voters.

14:43.677 --> 14:46.031
A new frontrunner has been crowned!

14:47.248 --> 14:50.643
What I did made the TV thing happen.

14:55.918 --> 14:58.031
<i>Live from our nation's capitol,</i>

14:58.036 --> 15:00.733
<i>this is Headbutt with Nash Castor.</i>

15:07.188 --> 15:08.543
Our top story:

15:08.546 --> 15:10.353
President Ralph Wiggum?

15:10.356 --> 15:12.730
Two days ago, this
bed-wetter made a splash

15:12.736 --> 15:14.870
in the Springfield Primary.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.863
With the remaining 49 primaries

15:16.905 --> 15:18.321
scheduled for next Tuesday,

15:18.327 --> 15:20.722
can Ralph go from Sesame Street

15:20.725 --> 15:22.333
to Pennsylvania Avenue?

15:22.337 --> 15:24.200
Adriatica Vel Johnson!

15:24.216 --> 15:25.281
Well, Nash,

15:25.288 --> 15:27.553
Ralph Wiggum is a breath of fresh air for

15:27.558 --> 15:29.641
a country hungry for a change of air.

15:29.648 --> 15:31.991
And he's already a master
of the sound bite,

15:31.997 --> 15:34.220
from take on immigration reform...

15:34.226 --> 15:35.500
Stranger danger!

15:35.516 --> 15:38.152
...to his disciplined stance
on government spending.

15:38.155 --> 15:40.371
I only have this much monies.

15:40.377 --> 15:44.873
Well, um, I'd hate to be the
fingernail in this Cobb salad,

15:44.877 --> 15:46.681
but we don't even know
if this young man

15:46.686 --> 15:48.390
is a Democrat or Republican.

15:48.395 --> 15:50.993
Before we invite
Ralph to the prom,

15:50.996 --> 15:52.290
we should find out if he's

15:52.297 --> 15:54.723
wearing a tux or a tutu.

15:55.548 --> 15:59.042
Mom, they're taking Ralph's
candidacy seriously.

15:59.046 --> 16:00.511
This is a disaster!

16:00.528 --> 16:02.171
Speaking of disasters,

16:02.177 --> 16:03.582
have you seen this?

16:03.586 --> 16:06.681
Springfield Dodge bought
too much inventory,

16:06.688 --> 16:08.221
and they've only got one weekend

16:08.226 --> 16:10.570
to get rid of all the '07s.

16:13.045 --> 16:16.343
Lisa, I'm sure this Wiggum-arole
will blow over.

16:16.345 --> 16:17.673
You have to have faith in

16:17.688 --> 16:19.513
the wisdom of the average voter.

16:19.516 --> 16:20.682
I dig the Wig!

16:20.687 --> 16:21.940
I dig the Wig!

16:21.947 --> 16:23.291
Oh, dear God...

16:23.296 --> 16:25.771
Come on, Lis, hop on
the Wiggum Wagon.

16:25.778 --> 16:26.872
Ralph said he'd let me be

16:26.876 --> 16:28.091
Secretary of Indian burns.

16:28.098 --> 16:29.681
Here's my first official act:

16:30.146 --> 16:31.161
Ow!

16:31.427 --> 16:33.181
Ralph can't be president.

16:33.266 --> 16:36.192
He's the dumbest person,
in the slowest reading group.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.632
Lisa, being president is easy.

16:38.647 --> 16:40.883
You just point the Army and shoot.

16:40.888 --> 16:42.321
And Ralph is only eight years old.

16:42.325 --> 16:45.030
It says in the Constitution,
you have to be 35.

16:45.057 --> 16:46.392
The Constitution?

16:46.425 --> 16:48.591
I'm pretty sure the
Patriot Act killed it

16:48.596 --> 16:49.780
to ensure our freedoms.

16:49.787 --> 16:52.282
Oh, the Patriot Act
is so terrible!

16:52.287 --> 16:53.531
The government might find out

16:53.535 --> 16:55.713
what library books I take out.

16:55.718 --> 16:56.330
What's next?

16:56.337 --> 16:58.423
Finding out what operas I go to?

17:00.125 --> 17:01.052
So it's agreed:

17:01.056 --> 17:02.962
we cancel the rest of
the primaries and offer

17:02.975 --> 17:05.960
the G.O.P. nomination
to this knee-high want-wit.

17:05.964 --> 17:08.173
My oil rig is already gushin' for

17:08.176 --> 17:09.512
this Wiggum critter!

17:09.518 --> 17:11.460
Do you have bats in your belfry?

17:11.465 --> 17:14.119
They don't even let him
use big-boy scissors!

17:14.137 --> 17:15.982
Sure he's a little green, but, uh,

17:15.988 --> 17:17.462
you know, so was George W. Bush,

17:17.468 --> 17:20.012
and look how great, uh,he-he... um...

17:20.018 --> 17:21.992
But at least he won!

17:21.996 --> 17:23.050
The second time...

17:23.058 --> 17:26.592
assuming they don't find
those ballot boxes in Ohio.

17:27.306 --> 17:30.051
Look, the Wiggum boy's better
than anyone else we've got.

17:30.058 --> 17:30.912
Hear! Hear!

17:30.917 --> 17:34.192
Well, if you put it that way...

17:37.118 --> 17:39.823
This meeting of the Democratic Party

17:39.826 --> 17:41.592
will come to order, babies.

17:41.596 --> 17:44.161
So if we nominate this
Ralph Wiggums,

17:44.168 --> 17:47.080
we will be likean
unstoppable choo-choo.

17:47.638 --> 17:49.213
I already got my assless,

17:49.217 --> 17:51.662
sparkle tux cleaned
for the inauguration.

17:51.665 --> 17:53.661
I agree with my ex-husband.

17:53.666 --> 17:54.952
With Ralph on the ticket,

17:54.958 --> 17:56.833
I don't know how we will blow it,

17:56.835 --> 17:57.903
but we will.

17:57.907 --> 18:00.862
Because that's what the
Democratic Party is all about.

18:00.867 --> 18:01.752
- Yeah.
- Yes.

18:04.696 --> 18:05.881
This is Kent Brockman reporting

18:05.886 --> 18:06.841
from the Wiggum compound,

18:06.845 --> 18:08.691
where both parties have
gathered to court

18:08.698 --> 18:10.510
the most charismatic child since

18:10.517 --> 18:12.412
Drew Barrymore in Firestarter.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.903
When she got mad,
they got burned.

18:18.717 --> 18:19.800
Ralph, both parties want

18:19.815 --> 18:21.173
to offer you their nomination.

18:21.177 --> 18:22.031
Whom do you like?

18:23.595 --> 18:24.662
Go ahead, Ralphie.

18:24.677 --> 18:26.211
You're invited to two parties

18:26.218 --> 18:28.343
one with a donkey
and one with an elephant.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.250
Who do you like?

18:30.918 --> 18:31.852
Elmo?

18:31.858 --> 18:33.742
Ah, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt,

18:33.747 --> 18:35.502
Richard Nixon's chief
of naval operations.

18:35.508 --> 18:37.291
So Ralph's a Republican!

18:37.295 --> 18:38.441
Not so fast, Kent.

18:38.446 --> 18:40.601
Zumwalt ran for the senatein '76

18:40.605 --> 18:41.522
as a Democrat.

18:41.525 --> 18:42.950
No way, Lou

18:42.957 --> 18:44.991
you're thinking of
Admiral Hyman Rickover.

18:45.117 --> 18:46.691
The father of the Nuclear Navy?

18:46.698 --> 18:47.700
As if!

18:47.708 --> 18:49.443
Only one place to settle this :

18:49.447 --> 18:51.933
to the offices of the
World Book Encyclopedia!

18:55.945 --> 18:56.673
Ralph!

18:56.726 --> 18:57.441
Ralph!

18:57.495 --> 18:58.153
Ralph!

19:04.327 --> 19:06.620
Ralph, darling, be a Democrat.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.112
We have Alec Baldwin,

19:08.118 --> 19:09.871
they have Stephen Baldwin.

19:09.878 --> 19:12.292
They might as well not
even have a Baldwin.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.591
Leave him alone,
you vultures!

19:14.637 --> 19:15.582
Who are you?

19:16.428 --> 19:18.050
Ralph and I used to date.

19:19.465 --> 19:20.021
Nice.

19:20.088 --> 19:22.133
Now maybe you can
help him pick a party.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.200
Ralph, they have no
right to do this to you.

19:26.205 --> 19:27.770
They just want to use you.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.721
Maybe I want to use them.

19:29.748 --> 19:31.862
Maybe you wha...?!

19:31.866 --> 19:34.352
Use them to make this
country great again.

19:34.356 --> 19:36.871
When we're mad,
we'll just use our words,

19:36.878 --> 19:39.570
then the rest of the world
will play nice with us.

19:39.577 --> 19:42.451
And the only boom-booms
will be in our pants.

19:42.955 --> 19:45.341
Maybe you wouldn't be
such a bad president.

19:45.348 --> 19:47.710
And you can be my first ladle.

19:47.716 --> 19:49.140
I like the sound of that.

19:49.177 --> 19:49.762
Ralph!

19:49.897 --> 19:50.653
Ralph!

19:50.675 --> 19:51.342
Ralph!

19:51.845 --> 19:52.592
Ralph!!

19:52.625 --> 19:53.373
Ralph!!!

19:53.388 --> 19:54.153
Ralph!!!

19:54.185 --> 19:55.793
<i>The following is a paid
political announcement</i>

19:55.796 --> 19:57.210
<i>by the Republican and Democratic parties.</i>

20:05.157 --> 20:06.552
<i>These are all words</i>

20:06.555 --> 20:08.471
<i>Ralph Wiggum doesn't know;</i>

20:08.478 --> 20:10.312
<i>but he doesn't need to know them,</i>

20:10.318 --> 20:12.580
<i>he lives them, every day.</i>

20:12.587 --> 20:13.990
I'm voting Ralph for president.

20:13.996 --> 20:16.561
His easy smile makes me
think everything is okay,

20:16.565 --> 20:17.780
even when I know it ain't.

20:17.785 --> 20:19.341
I'm voting for Ralph, too.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.150
But don't tell you-know-who.

20:22.435 --> 20:23.500
<i>On November 4th,</i>

20:23.508 --> 20:25.762
<i>vote for the latest in a long line</i>

20:25.765 --> 20:28.051
<i>of great American leaders.</i>

20:28.567 --> 20:30.300
I want a tricycle,

20:30.306 --> 20:32.983
and a dog who won't chew my Hot Wheels,

20:32.987 --> 20:35.300
and a brighter future for America!

20:35.308 --> 20:36.453
I'm Ralph Wiggum,

20:36.466 --> 20:38.223
and I've been a good boy!
