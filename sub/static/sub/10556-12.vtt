00:48.548 --> 00:51.346
Toronto is one of the safest
cities in North America.

00:51.418 --> 00:52.976
Let us hope so, Inspector.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.850
After all, we are talking about

00:54.921 --> 00:57.151
His Royal Highness
Prince Alfred.

00:57.223 --> 01:01.421
Queen Victoria is very, very
protective over her grandson.

01:01.494 --> 01:03.428
I've assigned
two very experienced officers

01:03.496 --> 01:05.589
to make sure that the prince's
visit goes as planned.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.530
There are
some lingering concerns.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.999
Lingering concerns?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.559
The War Office
has received information

01:10.637 --> 01:12.468
that the Irish
may be plotting something

01:12.539 --> 01:14.006
against a member
of the royal family.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.268
This is Canada, sir.

01:15.341 --> 01:17.639
There's no need to worry
about such things.

01:28.721 --> 01:32.714
Still, there have been
Irish aggressions

01:32.792 --> 01:34.157
in Canada before, sir.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.388
The Fenian raids
were 30 years ago.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.055
If there was any activity
in Toronto,

01:38.131 --> 01:39.792
I would definitely
be aware of it.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.356
Well, let us hope so, Inspector.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.402
The last thing we need
is an incident.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.070
David Jennings.
Aide to His Royal Highness.

01:55.148 --> 01:56.638
Oh, gosh.
It's a pleasure, sir.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.377
Detective William Murdoch,

01:58.451 --> 02:01.011
and this is
Constable George Crabtree.

02:01.087 --> 02:02.019
At your service.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.454
They will be keeping a keen eye
on the prince.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.185
Excellent.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.056
The prince can be something
of a...

02:08.127 --> 02:09.151
Pleasure-seeker.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.594
Yes.
One way of putting it.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.756
His reputation precedes him,
sir.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.459
But no need to worry.
He'll be in good hands.

02:14.534 --> 02:15.466
Quite right.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.663
Detective Murdoch goes out
of his way to avoid pleasure.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.002
Ah, excellent.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.871
Then we look forward to enjoying

02:22.942 --> 02:26.002
your, as they say,
Toronto the Good.

02:37.023 --> 02:39.048
How could you do this to me?

03:17.697 --> 03:19.722
Ah, good evening, gentlemen.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.063
Please come.
Come.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.442
Detective Murdoch,
Constable Crabtree,

03:30.510 --> 03:32.774
may I present
His Royal Highness Prince Alfred

03:32.845 --> 03:34.745
of Edinburgh,
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.475
Gosh, it's just a pleasure, sir.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.813
It's a pleasure to be
at your service, Your Highness.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.580
Tomorrow, gentlemen,

03:40.653 --> 03:43.019
his Highness has a breakfast
with the mayor,

03:43.089 --> 03:45.023
a primary-school
choir presentation,

03:45.091 --> 03:48.026
and then an evening performance
at Massey Hall.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.085
Sir?

03:50.163 --> 03:54.361
Would Your Highness care to
continue this at a later stage?

03:54.434 --> 03:55.560
Pardon my rudeness,

03:55.635 --> 03:57.694
but important matters
demand my attention.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.931
Perhaps we can finish this
later, gentlemen.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.132
Yes, perhaps.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.231
Of course, of course,

04:02.308 --> 04:04.401
we'll assume our posts
in the corridor.

04:11.217 --> 04:15.244
Well, I must say the prince made
a much better first impression

04:15.321 --> 04:17.185
than I assumed he would.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.317
Go on, George.
Read it.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.199
"There was a prince
who liked to succumb,

04:27.267 --> 04:30.634
to vulgar young girls
with big bums.

04:30.703 --> 04:33.001
But he knew he was trapped
and would have to adapt,

04:33.072 --> 04:36.007
so he begs you instead
for some rum. "

04:36.075 --> 04:39.602
A poet.
Excellent.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.047
Sir.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.209
A body's been found.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.617
I'm right behind you.
George, guard the prince.

04:47.687 --> 04:49.314
Sir.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.889
Did you like my poem?

04:59.966 --> 05:03.367
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
It was very creative.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.563
Jennings, that old cat,
has gone to bed,

05:05.638 --> 05:08.539
and now the mice can play.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.098
Would you acquire something
for me?

05:10.176 --> 05:12.303
Absolutely.
What can I get you?

05:13.413 --> 05:14.402
Girls.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.650
This is how she was found?

05:21.387 --> 05:22.319
It's eerie, sir.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.913
She looks as though
she's sleeping.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.462
- What's that, sir?
- A Claddagh ring.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.525
The hands symbolize friendship,
the heart is love,

05:36.602 --> 05:38.661
and the crown is loyalty.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.330
I don't see a crown, sir.

05:40.406 --> 05:44.137
It's sometimes removed
as a symbolic gesture,

05:44.210 --> 05:47.008
a sign of defiance
toward the British.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.308
By who?

05:48.381 --> 05:50.542
The Irish Republican
Brotherhood.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.277
The Brotherhood.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.914
Sir, the prince.

05:54.987 --> 05:55.954
Yes.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.422
The prince may indeed be
in grave danger.

06:01.728 --> 06:02.956
Sir!

06:03.029 --> 06:04.223
Sir!

06:04.297 --> 06:05.730
Sir.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.164
I found this in the bushes
about 50 yards that way.

06:08.234 --> 06:09.701
It's most likely the victim's.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.067
Excellent, but you
shouldn't be touching it.

06:12.138 --> 06:14.231
How else would I pick it up?

06:14.307 --> 06:16.332
Constable,
evidence should not be touched

06:16.409 --> 06:18.172
until fingermarks
have been raised.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.712
Oh, well, I'm not really up
on those, sir.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.146
Later I'll show you
how it's done.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.377
I don't think
I have the mind for it, sir.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.816
Nonsense.
Anyone can learn.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.855
Thank you, sir.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.923
Miss Margaret Gilpatrick.
A fine Irish name.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.758
Let's find her next of kin,
Constable.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.890
Um, sir,
I've certainly done my share

06:40.967 --> 06:42.798
of filling the cells
with drunkards and pickpockets,

06:42.869 --> 06:45.235
but I've never assisted
a detective before.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.328
And?

06:46.906 --> 06:49.841
How would one go about locating
a victim's family?

06:49.909 --> 06:52.400
You'll want to search
the public records

06:52.478 --> 06:53.706
and find her next of kin.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.372
Then bring them to me.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.643
Public records.
Brilliant, sir.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.447
Thank you.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.489
Higgins, keep an eye
on the gentlemen of the press.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.989
- And not a word.
- Sir.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.490
Right, then,
what about this ring?

07:06.559 --> 07:09.460
Well, sir, a dead Irish girl
wearing a Brotherhood ring

07:09.529 --> 07:10.587
on the very night

07:10.663 --> 07:13.257
that Mr. Jennings warned
about a possible Irish threat.

07:13.332 --> 07:15.300
Hardly a coincidence,
I should think.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.233
Let's not sound the alarms yet,
Murdoch.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.395
I simply think that it...

07:18.471 --> 07:20.063
We don't want the prince
to think

07:20.139 --> 07:21.504
that Toronto's not a safe place.

07:21.574 --> 07:25.169
Let's keep our eyes open
and close this case quickly.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.438
It would be a tremendous help

07:26.512 --> 07:28.537
if I could have
Constable Crabtree's assistance.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.344
For some reason, the prince
has took a shine to Crabtree,

07:31.417 --> 07:33.715
so you'll have to make do
with Higg... Bollocks!

07:33.786 --> 07:36.755
Higgins, you daft bastard!
I said, "Don't say a word!"

07:36.823 --> 07:38.688
Excuse my language, Doctor.

07:38.758 --> 07:41.454
Oi!
You lot, away!

07:41.527 --> 07:43.358
Dr. Ogden,
have you found anything?

07:43.429 --> 07:44.521
This scratch on her neck.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.462
It's as if something
was torn from her.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.962
- A necklace, perhaps?
- But why?

07:51.037 --> 07:52.527
The murderer didn't take
her ring,

07:52.605 --> 07:53.902
which seems to rule out robbery.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.533
Perhaps the necklace held
a special significance.

07:56.609 --> 07:59.806
There's blood and skin under the
fingernails of her right hand.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.506
- She fought her attacker.
- Yes.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.375
Good girl.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.750
Your Highness, please!

08:14.427 --> 08:15.451
Shh!

08:15.528 --> 08:17.928
You'll wake Jennings
with all that pounding.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.965
Your Highness, I'm sorry
I have to be so strict,

08:20.032 --> 08:21.795
but we have had
several complaints

08:21.868 --> 08:24.598
about the noise
and the thumping.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.695
And while I'm sure
no one will ask you to leave,

08:26.772 --> 08:27.739
there is a possibility

08:27.807 --> 08:29.104
I'll catch some of the trouble
for this.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.870
Oh, I will make this up to you.
I promise.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.240
Thank you.
If you could just...

08:32.311 --> 08:34.245
Girls!
Over here.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.076
Oh, Your Highness, please.
No more girls.

08:36.148 --> 08:37.672
Not for me.
For you.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.014
A token
of my royal appreciation.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.576
Make nice.

08:41.654 --> 08:44.817
Sir, so we'll agree to...

08:45.224 --> 08:46.316
Hello.

08:46.392 --> 08:48.519
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.291
I can understand the confusion.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.961
It looks just like her.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.766
Is this not your daughter,
Mr. Gilpatrick?

08:59.839 --> 09:01.704
My Maggie May was a lovely girl.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.174
She'll be back.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.047
We found a handbag
near the scene of the crime.

09:09.115 --> 09:10.639
In it was a number
of calling cards.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.978
Your daughter's name
was on them.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.348
Was it, now?

09:13.419 --> 09:16.217
But we found this
on her shoulder.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.486
Do you recognize it?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.227
That's not the tattoo she had.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.962
Your daughter had
a different tattoo?

09:30.036 --> 09:31.526
She marked her skin.

09:31.604 --> 09:34.664
That's how I know
she was not herself.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.504
How do you mean?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.737
Maggie turned wild.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.575
On account of living
with that Ann girl.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.275
She's a bad seed, that one.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.450
He's a crazy old coot,
her father.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.216
Came over here one night yelling

09:50.289 --> 09:52.189
that she wasn't
his daughter anymore.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.123
Do you think
he could have hurt her?

09:54.193 --> 09:56.889
I suppose anything is possible,

09:56.963 --> 10:02.230
but, deep down, I think
he loved her something fierce.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.667
He said something about
Maggie was different.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.967
Why would he say that?

10:07.039 --> 10:13.672
Maggie used to be quite merry,
but lately she'd grown sullen.

10:13.746 --> 10:17.238
I thought she might be
in trouble.

10:17.316 --> 10:21.548
Constable, could you please
pass me that photograph?

10:27.593 --> 10:30.562
This cross on Maggie's necklace,
what can you tell me about it?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.996
A gift from her mother.

10:33.065 --> 10:35.659
She's dead now.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.067
Mags never took it off.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.866
You said you thought
she might be in trouble.

10:39.939 --> 10:40.871
What did you mean?

10:40.940 --> 10:43.340
Perhaps in the family way?

10:43.409 --> 10:44.774
No.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.505
Mags had a sweetheart.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.343
John Tucker.

10:49.415 --> 10:52.213
But they'd been fighting lately.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.911
A lot.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.045
And where might we
be able to find him?

10:56.122 --> 10:58.352
They used to go to Bible study
together.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.621
At least,
that's what she told her father.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.924
And what church
was that held at?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.657
Church? Ha.

11:05.731 --> 11:11.533
Yes, well,
I suppose to some it is.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.249
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like a word, please.

11:26.318 --> 11:27.842
Bartender, Toronto police.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.683
I'd like to speak with you,
please.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.889
Sir.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.258
You can answer in here,
or you can answer outside!

11:38.330 --> 11:39.661
It's your choice.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.962
- Something to say?
- Be still!

11:44.270 --> 11:47.501
Not in my bar.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.268
Will.

11:52.344 --> 11:53.436
Eddie?

11:53.512 --> 11:55.537
Why would you expect them
to talk?

11:55.614 --> 11:56.808
We're just doing our jobs.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.873
Last time the coppers came by
for a chat,

11:58.951 --> 12:00.851
Paddy O'Neil got a gash
in the back of the head

12:00.920 --> 12:01.978
that put him out for a week.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.454
Well, if that happens again,
you tell me. I'll make it right.

12:04.523 --> 12:06.514
Yeah.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.385
It's been a long time, Will.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.054
It sure has.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.564
What? They make you a detective
now, is that right?

12:13.632 --> 12:15.964
Yeah.
Beats logging.

12:16.035 --> 12:18.936
I tried to write you at the
seminary after Jesuit school.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.938
Well, the priesthood
didn't work out.

12:21.006 --> 12:21.938
I met a girl.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.497
Oh, you're married.
Congratulations.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.136
Well, that didn't really
work out, either.

12:26.212 --> 12:29.545
But the bar
seems to keep me going.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.014
You still doing a bit of boxing?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.142
No. I see enough of that
in the streets.

12:33.219 --> 12:36.313
Yeah, either that or Father
O'Brien beat it out of you.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.982
Did a week ever go by

12:39.058 --> 12:40.616
we didn't see
the inside of his office?

12:40.693 --> 12:43.423
No.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.056
Eddie,
I'm investigating a murder.

12:46.132 --> 12:49.101
A young woman named Maggie
Gilpatrick was found dead.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.534
I'm looking for a gentleman
friend of hers, a John Tucker.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.731
Yeah.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.434
I knew Maggie.
A shame about that.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.704
John Tucker?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.507
No, name doesn't ring a bell.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.069
What, did he have something
to do with the death?

13:02.148 --> 13:03.513
I just want to talk to him.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.311
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

13:05.384 --> 13:07.375
Would you, uh, fancy a pint?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.921
No, I'm still on duty.
Perhaps another time.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.217
Oh, yeah.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.023
The body's still
the Lord's temple, eh, Will?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.660
See ya.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.896
I have a good mind to report
this to your inspector

13:24.970 --> 13:26.995
and have you removed
from this position.

13:27.072 --> 13:28.972
Mr. Jennings,
with all due respect,

13:29.041 --> 13:31.874
I did manage to eventually end
the party.

13:31.944 --> 13:34.674
After His Royal Highness's
undergarments ended up

13:34.747 --> 13:36.305
in a tree on King Street.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.974
Oh, I meant to get those.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.518
I will remind you, Constable,
your duty here

13:40.586 --> 13:43.282
also includes keeping the prince
from doing harm.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.186
To himself
and, more importantly,

13:45.257 --> 13:47.919
to the reputation of the Crown.

13:47.993 --> 13:52.054
Do not let it happen again.

13:52.131 --> 13:54.463
Yes, sir.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.240
We're getting out.
Let's go.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.372
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.075
- The schedule says...
- We've a spot of time.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.708
Now, come on.
Let's have some fun.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.753
Your Highness,
please come back now!

14:14.820 --> 14:16.788
You're with me, or you're not.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.847
Either way,
I'm leaving this hotel.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.414
Your Highness.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.823
I forbid it!

14:21.894 --> 14:23.828
Oh, you do, do you?

14:23.896 --> 14:26.330
Well, suit yourself, Constable.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.900
You know I could have you
beheaded for this.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.342
Right now, that would only be
too merciful, sir.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.939
Lunch has been scheduled
at the harbor, sir.

14:45.017 --> 14:46.951
Does this suit Your Highness?

14:48.020 --> 14:50.113
That'll be fine.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.718
What?

14:53.792 --> 14:55.259
You couldn't get a word
out of anybody?

14:55.327 --> 14:56.259
No, sir.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.159
You know the choffing bartender,
for God's sake.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.255
But I haven't spoken to him
in over 20 years.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.300
I can't just walk in
and demand information.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.995
Yeah, not with him being a mick.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.661
The Irish
have always been stroppy.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.501
You can hardly blame them.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.165
Oh, my God.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.232
What's that I can hear?
Violins?

15:11.310 --> 15:12.834
We're not in Ireland, Murdoch.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.971
Look outside.
Smell the maple leaves.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.514
This is Canada.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.049
Yes, well, at any rate,

15:18.117 --> 15:20.950
the "micks" aren't going to
talk to us now, so...

15:21.020 --> 15:24.786
Then find some other way
to get to the bottom of things.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.057
Higgins, were you able to raise
any fingermarks

15:29.128 --> 15:30.095
off of the handbag?

15:30.162 --> 15:32.756
Uh, loads of them, sir.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.662
Just, all mine.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.525
Right.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.093
I have another job for you.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.332
I need you
to help me find someone.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.898
Detective Murdoch, I understand
you've been looking for me.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.103
I'm John Tucker.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.578
Never mind.
I found him.

15:48.647 --> 15:52.310
Mr. Tucker,
when did you last see Maggie?

15:52.384 --> 15:54.443
A couple of days ago.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.148
I loved her more than anything.

15:57.222 --> 15:58.814
Yet you fought with her.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.416
Who told you that?
Ann?

16:01.493 --> 16:04.428
We fought because she was
stubborn and opinionated.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.895
And she wouldn't listen to me.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.092
And just how heated
did these arguments get?

16:08.167 --> 16:11.159
You think I had something to do
with Maggie's death.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.362
Well, I didn't.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.702
The fights,
what were they about?

16:14.773 --> 16:16.798
- Her father.
- What about him?

16:16.875 --> 16:19.776
His mind.
He's gone a bit loony, sir.

16:19.845 --> 16:20.903
How so?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.778
He's got it into his head
that Maggie was a changeling.

16:23.849 --> 16:27.979
So, if you're looking for a
killer, sir, I'd start with him.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.156
The fairies.

16:31.223 --> 16:34.317
They stole my girl,
and in her place they left it.

16:34.393 --> 16:36.361
A changeling.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.089
Yes.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.654
I asked it,
"Be you a changeling? "

16:40.733 --> 16:42.098
"No, no," it cried.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.998
But I knew.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.661
How did you know?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.706
It had to say what it was.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.833
It had to say it was
a changeling, but it wouldn't.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.104
- So you had to kill it?
- No.

16:53.178 --> 16:56.511
I had to be sly
to match its wits.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.072
An elixir of herbs and milk

16:58.150 --> 17:00.448
should make it say
it was a changeling.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.454
It drank it, ran hell-bound,

17:03.522 --> 17:05.615
and then I sees it
on your table.

17:07.126 --> 17:10.686
If the changeling is dead,
Mr. Gilpatrick, where is Maggie?

17:10.762 --> 17:12.127
She'll soon be released.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.529
- Released from...
- From the fairies.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.963
They'll be
bringing her home soon.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.128
I must go and meet her.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.330
Mr. Gilpatrick.

17:21.406 --> 17:24.535
I think you'll need to stay
with us a little while longer.

17:24.609 --> 17:28.011
If Mr. Gilpatrick
was telling the truth,

17:28.079 --> 17:31.846
we should find traces of
milk and herbs in her stomach.

17:32.751 --> 17:34.082
And there it is.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.383
Basil, I'd say by the odor.

17:38.357 --> 17:41.554
So, Mr. Gilpatrick
did give her the herbs.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.390
But if he wanted
his daughter back,

17:43.462 --> 17:45.692
he needed the changeling alive.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.698
Killing her makes no sense.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.564
That's not the only odd thing,
William.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.934
What role did
a piece of paper play

17:53.005 --> 17:55.269
in the exorcising
of a changeling?

17:55.340 --> 17:59.140
More to the point, what role
did it play in her murder?

18:02.681 --> 18:04.842
So, Maggie Gilpatrick
is in the park.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.544
Someone is stalking her.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.587
They catch her and force the
piece of paper down her throat.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.816
Perhaps as a punishment
of some sort?

18:11.890 --> 18:15.417
Or she ate it to keep
anyone else from having it.

18:16.829 --> 18:17.761
It's blank.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.060
Except for these small holes.

18:20.132 --> 18:23.624
Yes, they're not punctures
or tears.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.537
They've been carefully cut out.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.664
For what purpose?

18:30.576 --> 18:34.239
A very practical
and surreptitious one.

18:34.313 --> 18:35.507
The key to a code?

18:35.581 --> 18:37.048
Not a code, sir.
A cipher.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.641
- The difference is...
- Don't start splitting hairs.

18:39.718 --> 18:41.015
Have you not heard
of the ciphers

18:41.086 --> 18:42.348
of Verne's
Count Mathias Sandorf?

18:42.421 --> 18:44.446
Murdoch, just explain it to me.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.854
When a cipher's key is laid

18:45.924 --> 18:48.051
over a specific page of text
from a book,

18:48.127 --> 18:49.116
letters are isolated.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.458
Those letters form words,
revealing a message.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.521
- Which book?
- That's the question.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.191
Lot of good that does us, then.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.859
Why was the paper
in the girl's stomach?

18:56.935 --> 18:59.062
To keep it from falling
into the wrong hands?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.230
Brave girl.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.863
Sir?

19:01.940 --> 19:05.034
Dr. Ogden wants you back.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.512
When Mr. Gilpatrick said Maggie
had another marking on her arm,

19:13.585 --> 19:15.143
I began to wonder
whether the sun tattoo

19:15.220 --> 19:17.017
was actually hiding
another tattoo.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.819
You've found a way
to remove the sun.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.450
Yes, I believe I have.

19:21.527 --> 19:24.792
- You're going to burn it off.
- Precisely.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.827
Cover your mouth.
Try not to inhale the fumes.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.134
Let's see
whether this has worked.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.849
Amazing.

19:45.918 --> 19:49.354
There is another tattoo.
Can you uncover it any further?

19:53.592 --> 19:55.059
It's a phoenix rising.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.719
William,
you realize what this means?

19:57.796 --> 20:00.458
All too well.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.523
Symbol of the Brotherhood.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.569
And this was found
on the dead girl, yes?

20:04.636 --> 20:06.069
Yes.
Between this and the ring,

20:06.138 --> 20:08.072
it strongly suggests
that something is afoot.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.040
What that might be is not known.

20:10.108 --> 20:12.201
We've talked with our informers,
and we've come up with nothing.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.608
In fact,
we can't even be certain

20:13.679 --> 20:16.113
that the Brotherhood is active
in Toronto at the moment.

20:16.181 --> 20:19.048
Gentlemen, I suggest we increase
security on His Highness.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.948
We won't stray
from his schedule,

20:21.019 --> 20:23.852
but we will certainly shorten
his public appearances.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.549
Perhaps this matter
would be best discussed

20:25.624 --> 20:26.648
with His Royal Highness.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.215
Oh, no need, Inspector.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.954
The British have never,
nor will they ever,

20:30.028 --> 20:32.360
run in the face
of Irish hooliganism.

20:32.431 --> 20:36.060
I trust you will get to the
bottom of matters eventually.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.594
Good day.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.241
Arrogant little prick.

20:47.312 --> 20:49.439
No wonder half the world
hates the bloody monarchy.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.940
What?
Well, they do.

20:53.018 --> 20:56.010
Uh, no, I was just wondering

20:56.088 --> 20:58.318
why Maggie Gilpatrick
would cover her tattoo.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.755
To keep that crazy father
of hers

20:59.825 --> 21:01.292
from beating the bejesus
out of her.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.487
Very good, sir.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.725
Clearly, the tattoo proves that
she was part of the Brotherhood.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.130
Yet she covered it up.
Had she left the group?

21:09.201 --> 21:10.862
Well, if she had,
they wouldn't take it lightly.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.563
Apparently, Maggie had been
attending Bible study

21:12.638 --> 21:13.605
with John Tucker.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.469
I wonder if these were, in fact,
Brotherhood gatherings.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.700
And this John Tucker.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.471
He just walks right in
and volunteers information.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.977
Now, why would he do that?

21:21.046 --> 21:23.571
Yes.
Why, indeed?

21:31.056 --> 21:33.115
Very nice.
Try it on.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.684
No.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.228
Why not?

21:37.296 --> 21:38.456
No, no, no, no, no.

21:38.530 --> 21:39.929
It's not really me, sir.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.159
I insist.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.496
All right.

21:43.568 --> 21:44.865
Very good.

21:51.610 --> 21:55.102
The boys would have a good laugh
to see me in such finery.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.671
Nonsense.
They would respect you.

21:57.749 --> 22:02.448
That coat is an emblem of power,
and people respect power.

22:02.521 --> 22:03.988
There you go.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.388
That looks much better.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.086
So, you go through this
every day, Your Highness?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.822
The primping
has merely just begun.

22:11.963 --> 22:15.831
Eddie, after we spoke,
John Tucker somehow found me.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.768
That's a stroke of luck, then,
isn't it?

22:18.837 --> 22:19.997
I think it was specifically

22:20.072 --> 22:21.733
to blame Maggie's death
on her father

22:21.807 --> 22:23.707
and to throw me off the trail.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.970
And what trail might that be,
Will?

22:26.044 --> 22:27.341
I think John Tucker and Maggie

22:27.412 --> 22:29.039
were involved
with the Brotherhood.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.082
The Brotherhood.

22:31.149 --> 22:32.980
Ghosts long dead, Will.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.951
- She had the tattoo.
- And why not?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.988
We all have relatives
over there.

22:37.055 --> 22:39.990
People who spilled blood,
fought starvation,

22:40.058 --> 22:41.252
died for their religion.

22:41.326 --> 22:44.454
Eddie,
are the Brotherhood meeting?

22:46.598 --> 22:47.724
I wouldn't know, Will.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.790
If they are,
I can't say I could blame them.

22:49.868 --> 22:50.926
Why do you say that?

22:51.002 --> 22:53.197
Do you remember I told you
I met a girl?

22:53.271 --> 22:55.603
You told me it didn't work out.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.199
Her name was Abigail.

22:58.276 --> 23:00.437
She was a beautiful girl.

23:00.512 --> 23:03.879
She came over from Ireland to
make a new start with her aunt.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.413
We had a child, little Katie.

23:08.487 --> 23:13.356
Abby wanted her family
to see her, back home.

23:14.359 --> 23:16.884
So it took me a good part
of a year to save enough money

23:16.962 --> 23:18.520
to send them back home
to Ireland.

23:18.597 --> 23:21.430
- Are they there now?
- Yeah.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.333
Buried at Coolcross Hill.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.838
They were in church
when it happened.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.737
Brigade stormed in,
set fire to the whole building.

23:36.815 --> 23:39.909
Burnt them to a crisp.

23:41.586 --> 23:45.215
They said that the priest
was sheltering the Brotherhood.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.588
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

23:47.659 --> 23:51.720
So, how would you know?
You're not a mind reader.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.695
You're a copper.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.256
Sworn to uphold
Her Majesty's rules.

23:56.334 --> 23:58.302
I uphold the law, Eddie.

23:58.370 --> 24:01.032
Ah, well, there's a fine line

24:01.106 --> 24:03.734
between upholding the law
and being a lackey, Will.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.436
Sir?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.740
If I see this John Tucker
fellow,

24:09.815 --> 24:12.045
I'll let him know
that you're looking for him.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.512
Have you found Tucker?

24:15.587 --> 24:17.953
Uh, not exactly, sir.

24:18.023 --> 24:20.150
He was in here,
going through my things.

24:20.225 --> 24:22.125
And you're sure
it was John Tucker?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.185
I saw a dark figure
and cried out.

24:24.262 --> 24:26.560
Mrs. Meyboom from downstairs
heard and called up.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.064
He went straight into the hall,

24:28.133 --> 24:29.760
and I saw his face
clear as day.

24:29.835 --> 24:30.893
But you're all right, miss?

24:30.969 --> 24:32.994
But for a bump on my knee.

24:33.071 --> 24:36.598
Well, you should sit, miss.
Please.

24:37.342 --> 24:38.775
Miss Ryan, do you have any idea

24:38.844 --> 24:40.106
what he might have been
looking for?

24:40.178 --> 24:41.702
No.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.611
No idea at all.

24:46.518 --> 24:48.008
When a cipher's key is laid

24:48.086 --> 24:50.077
over a specific page of text
from a book,

24:50.155 --> 24:51.281
letters are isolated.

24:51.356 --> 24:52.755
Which book?

24:52.824 --> 24:55.520
Could it have been a book,
by chance?

24:58.730 --> 25:00.459
I would never have thought
of it.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.836
It's sacrilegious, I said.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.102
She told me it was tainted

25:11.176 --> 25:12.734
and wanted to burn it
when the weather turned.

25:12.811 --> 25:16.713
But maybe she was hiding it.

25:17.949 --> 25:19.746
It opens to the same place, sir.

25:19.818 --> 25:22.844
Yes.
The spine's broken.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.624
Well, that's interesting.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.320
Something's been written here
and erased.

25:30.395 --> 25:34.126
Yet the indentation
of the pencil remains.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.628
"Sic Semper Tyrannus. "

25:39.704 --> 25:41.899
"Thus Always to Tyrants. "

25:41.973 --> 25:44.032
Those were the words shouted out
by John Wilkes Booth

25:44.109 --> 25:46.100
right after he assassinated
President Lincoln.

25:46.177 --> 25:47.166
This could mean that the Irish

25:47.245 --> 25:48.576
are planning to assassinate
the prince.

25:48.647 --> 25:49.739
Maybe.

25:49.814 --> 25:51.247
At any rate,
I believe this is the page

25:51.316 --> 25:53.045
that holds the key
to their plans,

25:53.118 --> 25:55.678
if I can only decode it in time.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.356
Though we believe
we've matched the key

26:04.429 --> 26:05.487
to the correct Bible page,

26:05.564 --> 26:07.191
we've yet to decipher
the message.

26:07.265 --> 26:10.029
And you think these letters
spell out a plan of some sort?

26:10.101 --> 26:11.068
Most likely.

26:11.136 --> 26:12.068
From the Latin phrase,

26:12.137 --> 26:13.900
you can see why we believe
the prince's life

26:13.972 --> 26:15.337
to be in grave danger.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.034
And you've identified
a potential culprit?

26:17.108 --> 26:20.043
Yes, a man named John Tucker.
Recently arrived from Ireland.

26:20.111 --> 26:21.806
However,
no one knows anything about him.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.245
And where is he now?

26:23.315 --> 26:26.216
We are uncertain.

26:26.284 --> 26:28.115
Uncertain.

26:28.186 --> 26:30.916
Mr. Jennings, there's a train
leaving for Montreal

26:30.989 --> 26:31.956
tomorrow afternoon.

26:32.023 --> 26:34.287
From there, you can take
a steamship bound for England.

26:34.359 --> 26:37.021
These are very serious
developments.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.825
I'll take your advice
and present it to His Highness.

26:39.898 --> 26:40.956
Good.

26:41.032 --> 26:43.830
We've already sent a constable
to fetch him.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.632
- Under whose authority?
- Mine.

26:48.707 --> 26:50.538
I believe it to be
in his best interest.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.407
And in the meantime completely
ignoring proper protocol.

26:53.478 --> 26:56.811
I'll be reporting this
to your superior, Inspector.

26:56.881 --> 26:59.873
Yes, sir.
Understood.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.523
Eddie, where is John Tucker?

27:06.591 --> 27:08.525
Surely, you know something.

27:08.593 --> 27:12.427
Talk to me
while I can still help you.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.033
They're planning
an assassination.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.125
Did you know that?

27:19.504 --> 27:22.064
I want to believe
that you're not party to this,

27:22.140 --> 27:24.165
but you're making it
very difficult.

27:24.242 --> 27:28.611
Because we are talking
about murder.

27:31.049 --> 27:35.008
# Attend you gallant Irishmen #

27:35.086 --> 27:37.987
# And listen for a while #

27:38.056 --> 27:42.652
# I'll sing to you the praises
of the sons of Erin's Isle #

27:42.727 --> 27:44.592
Cold-blooded murder.

27:44.663 --> 27:51.125
# It's of those gallant heroes
who voluntarily ran #

27:51.202 --> 27:56.697
# To release two Irish Fenians
from an English prison van #

27:56.775 --> 27:58.606
Put him in a cell.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.666
Yes, sir.

27:59.744 --> 28:03.737
# William Deasy was a man
of good and noted fame #

28:03.815 --> 28:06.579
# Likewise, Michael Larkin,
we'll never forget his name #

28:06.651 --> 28:09.711
D, U, R, H, A, B, T.

28:09.788 --> 28:12.689
Oh, this makes no sense at all.
Bloody Irishmen.

28:15.393 --> 28:17.418
Irish.

28:23.935 --> 28:25.493
- Ogam.
- What?

28:25.570 --> 28:28.403
Ogam.
The ancient Irish alphabet.

28:28.473 --> 28:29.462
Oh, of course.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.941
Ancient Irish.
How bloody obvious.

28:32.010 --> 28:32.942
No, no, no.

28:33.011 --> 28:35.070
Words were written
in groups of five letters

28:35.146 --> 28:37.046
above and below a line.

28:37.115 --> 28:40.949
So let's divide them
into groups of five.

28:45.256 --> 28:46.951
Durham.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.822
Mary.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.793
Bellevue.

28:50.862 --> 28:52.523
Trinity.

28:52.597 --> 28:54.087
As in the Holy Trinity?

28:54.165 --> 28:55.462
No.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.160
Locations.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.294
Durham Road.
Mary Street.

28:59.370 --> 29:02.237
- Bellevue Park.
- Trinity College.

29:03.675 --> 29:05.836
What do you think they are?
Traps or ambushes?

29:05.910 --> 29:08.970
Maybe they're stops
along the prince's itinerary.

29:09.047 --> 29:10.344
I'll check his schedule.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.474
Send men to each
of these locations.

29:12.550 --> 29:13.539
We'd better hurry.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.813
The only thing
this doesn't say is when.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.082
Gentlemen.

29:18.156 --> 29:21.853
I'd like to introduce
my senior security officer.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.190
Mr. George Crabtree.

29:24.262 --> 29:27.459
What sort of pathetic lot
is this that stands before me?

29:27.532 --> 29:29.693
Crabtree, what the bloody hell
are you wearing,

29:29.768 --> 29:31.633
and what kind of
bollock-brain idea is this?

29:31.703 --> 29:33.728
Excuse my language,
Your Highness.

29:33.805 --> 29:34.897
It's a brilliant one, sir.

29:34.973 --> 29:37.168
He looks like
some poncy schoolboy.

29:37.242 --> 29:38.266
Yes, I know.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.004
But it's the perfect
undercover security disguise.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.911
Constable Crabtree's plan
from the beginning, eh?

29:42.981 --> 29:45.609
- Really?
- Uh, yes, definitely.

29:45.683 --> 29:48.243
Then you can remain in disguise
for the rest of this assignment.

29:48.319 --> 29:49.251
Right, Constable?

29:49.320 --> 29:52.050
Actually, sir, there's
a lot of pinning involved.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.522
Don't push it, Crabtree.

29:53.591 --> 29:55.149
Sir, if we could have
your attendance

29:55.226 --> 29:56.659
in the inspector's office,
please.

29:56.728 --> 29:57.660
Certainly.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.095
This way, Your Highness.

30:06.404 --> 30:08.099
- No.
- Your Highness.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.073
We don't have all the details,
but if you were to stay,

30:10.141 --> 30:11.403
you could be endangering
your life.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.568
If I might advise, sir,

30:12.644 --> 30:14.771
I suggest we call off the visit
at once.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.108
And still my answer is no.

30:16.181 --> 30:17.170
My grandmother,

30:17.248 --> 30:19.375
who I'll remind you
has been Queen of England

30:19.450 --> 30:21.008
for nearly 60 years,

30:21.085 --> 30:23.815
has had at least five attempts
on her life.

30:23.888 --> 30:24.980
Which is exactly why, sir...

30:25.056 --> 30:27.923
Which is exactly why I intend
to represent her faithfully

30:27.992 --> 30:30.017
and fulfill all my duties
here in Toronto.

30:30.094 --> 30:31.186
Prince Alfred, sir...

30:31.262 --> 30:35.665
Now I believe there's a library
to be dedicated.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.164
Of course, sir.

30:45.076 --> 30:46.566
We've checked
all of the locations,

30:46.644 --> 30:49.044
and the constables report
nothing out of the ordinary.

30:49.113 --> 30:50.307
And there's nothing
in the prince's schedule

30:50.381 --> 30:52.645
that puts him
at any of these locations.

30:52.717 --> 30:54.548
What if we're wrong?

30:54.619 --> 30:55.779
We're not wrong.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.549
We're just missing something.

30:57.622 --> 30:58.680
Sir?

30:58.756 --> 31:01.452
I found Tucker works
in a livery.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.187
Get every available man
and check it out.

31:03.261 --> 31:04.922
Sir, I've already done that.
He's not there.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.395
Well, what good is that, then?

31:06.464 --> 31:07.431
Because the livery he worked at

31:07.498 --> 31:08.965
rented the carriages
for the royal visit.

31:10.568 --> 31:13.469
Constable,
you may make detective yet.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.301
Thank you, sir.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.671
So, the carriage
may be involved.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.107
But now "Where? "
is the question.

31:37.328 --> 31:38.795
Here.

31:38.863 --> 31:40.922
That's where the prince
is dedicating the library.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.070
Your Highness,
something's wrong.

31:54.145 --> 31:55.169
Come with me to the carriage!

31:55.246 --> 31:57.942
- Everybody out!
- Excuse us! Excuse us!

31:58.016 --> 31:59.483
Move! Move!

31:59.550 --> 32:01.142
- George?
- Sir!

32:02.020 --> 32:04.545
Ah, Your Highness.
Thank goodness you're all right.

32:36.187 --> 32:38.883
Just thank God
no one was injured.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.016
With one fortunate exception.

32:41.092 --> 32:43.026
Detective, take a look at this.

32:44.595 --> 32:48.087
Looks like a necklace fused into
the victim's skin by the blast.

32:48.166 --> 32:49.565
Can you remove it?

32:57.342 --> 32:59.708
That's exactly like Maggie
Gilpatrick's missing necklace.

32:59.777 --> 33:01.768
Suggesting a personal
relationship between them.

33:01.846 --> 33:03.939
Her gentleman friend,
Mr. Tucker.

33:04.015 --> 33:04.947
Most likely.

33:05.016 --> 33:08.042
The bomb must have detonated
when he was planting it.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.950
- So, it's over, then?
- I hope so.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.012
But we must remain realistic.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.717
There could still be members
of the Brotherhood.

33:13.791 --> 33:14.723
It's best to be cautious.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.453
We've devised a plan
for tomorrow's parade.

33:16.527 --> 33:17.824
We'll brief you on it
in the morning.

33:17.895 --> 33:20.193
Excellent work, gentlemen.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.962
I can finally sleep more easily.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.871
Good night, sir.
Sleep well.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.706
John Tucker is dead.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.901
Well, congratulations,
Detective.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.102
You got your man.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.310
Did you know about the bomb?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.007
What bomb?

34:11.081 --> 34:14.176
That's the way it's going to be,
then, is it?

34:14.252 --> 34:17.187
- I'm just a frog in your eyes.
- Yeah.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.416
And I'm just a lowly mick
in yours.

34:19.489 --> 34:21.514
That's not the case,
at least not on my end.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.719
Am I free to go?

34:25.663 --> 34:26.652
Yes.

34:31.869 --> 34:33.130
All the best, Will.

34:37.141 --> 34:39.199
So, once again,
the plan is for the prince,

34:39.277 --> 34:42.303
accompanied by Constable
Crabtree and the Inspector,

34:42.380 --> 34:44.813
to take the royal carriage
to Queen's Park

34:44.882 --> 34:46.474
via the parade route.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.348
Crabtree, is His Highness ready?

34:48.418 --> 34:50.909
Indeed he is, sir.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.387
- That's not bad at all.
- No.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.016
- Hardly as handsome, though.
- No.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.286
Of course, sir.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.523
Sir, do you think I could wave?

34:59.597 --> 35:01.963
Out the carriage window, I mean.

35:02.033 --> 35:03.762
There's a regal twist of
the wrist you'll need to know,

35:03.835 --> 35:04.767
but, yes.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.667
Try not to show your face.

35:06.737 --> 35:07.669
Of course, sir.

35:07.738 --> 35:09.933
Once inside the Queen's Park
legislative building,

35:10.007 --> 35:11.338
you will wait for us.

35:11.409 --> 35:13.843
And Mr. Jennings,
Prince Alfred, and myself

35:13.911 --> 35:15.606
will take the circuitous route

35:15.680 --> 35:18.012
and arrive at the rear
of Queen's Park.

35:18.082 --> 35:19.242
Right, then.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.649
Let's get on with it.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.488
Your Highness,

35:30.561 --> 35:33.894
the plan is to meet the carriage
at the back of the hotel.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.264
Small change of plan.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.977
They must have delivered
their ransom demands by now.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.778
So, why haven't they killed us?

35:53.851 --> 35:56.251
We'll get you out of this,
Your Highness.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.584
It's you that
I'm concerned about, Detective.

36:01.959 --> 36:05.395
Jennings,
why are you doing this?

36:05.463 --> 36:06.896
What do you want?

36:06.964 --> 36:08.397
It's simple, Your Highness.

36:13.137 --> 36:15.765
I want my country back.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.316
Hello, Will.

36:26.884 --> 36:29.785
Bloody hell! What do you mean
it was abandoned, eh?

36:29.854 --> 36:32.186
We found their carriage
at Summerhill Ravine, sir.

36:32.256 --> 36:33.780
And the hotel suite?
Any clues there?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.086
Nothing to indicate
anything was amiss.

36:35.159 --> 36:37.059
Inspector,
is Detective Murdoch here?

36:37.128 --> 36:39.255
- I'm afraid not.
- Then I'll speak with you.

36:39.330 --> 36:40.695
This is not a very good time,
Doctor.

36:40.765 --> 36:42.062
I think
you'll want to hear this.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.532
I found this
in John Tucker's body.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.933
- He was shot?
- In the chest.

36:46.003 --> 36:47.470
He would have died
almost instantly.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.096
So, someone killed him
and made it appear

36:49.173 --> 36:50.299
that he died planting the bomb.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.365
They probably thought the fire
would destroy his body.

36:52.443 --> 36:53.410
But why kill Tucker?

36:53.477 --> 36:55.638
To make us think
we'd foiled the plot already.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.613
So you'd drop your guard.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.513
And apparently it worked.
Thank you, Doctor.

36:59.584 --> 37:02.644
Inspector, Detective Murdoch.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.416
He's in danger, is he?

37:05.489 --> 37:06.888
Yes, he is.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.086
But you won't be seeing him
on your slab anytime soon.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.356
I promise you.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.392
This friend of Murdoch's.
What's his name?

37:15.466 --> 37:17.058
Eddie Cullen, sir.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.362
Find out everything you can
about him.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.301
I want to know who he is,
where he lives,

37:20.371 --> 37:22.202
and what he had for breakfast,
understood?

37:22.273 --> 37:24.002
- Sir.
- Sir.

37:30.881 --> 37:33.441
You're only making things worse
for yourself.

37:33.517 --> 37:36.247
By now, the police will know
what's happened.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.447
Doesn't matter.

37:39.390 --> 37:41.255
This plan's been months
in the making.

37:41.325 --> 37:42.292
If that's the case,

37:42.360 --> 37:44.419
it couldn't possibly have
included Detective Murdoch.

37:44.495 --> 37:46.258
Let him go, Jennings.

37:46.330 --> 37:50.266
You're in no position
to be making demands.

37:57.842 --> 38:00.242
Your Highness.

38:01.212 --> 38:03.043
Mr. Jennings.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.412
This is insanity.

38:05.483 --> 38:07.451
You'll never get away with this.
Give up.

38:07.518 --> 38:09.145
You've already lost one man.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.983
A small price to pay.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.583
And what about
Maggie Gilpatrick's death?

38:14.659 --> 38:17.321
Was that a small price to pay
as well?

38:17.395 --> 38:19.693
What about Maggie?
She had nothing to do with this.

38:19.764 --> 38:22.460
She knew
what she was getting into.

38:22.533 --> 38:23.522
What?

38:23.601 --> 38:25.660
Jennings?

38:25.736 --> 38:27.761
What about you, Eddie?

38:27.838 --> 38:30.500
Two people have now died.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.201
Is this what you thought
you were getting into?

38:32.276 --> 38:34.801
Just shut up.
All right?

38:34.879 --> 38:38.610
Sir, this arrived at The Gazette
20 minutes ago.

38:38.683 --> 38:40.514
"We free the prince
when you free Ireland. "

38:40.584 --> 38:41.915
That's an impossible demand.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.783
There's something not quite
right here.

38:43.854 --> 38:45.845
How did they get onto our plans?

38:45.923 --> 38:48.050
Well, think, Crabtree.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.059
They must have got someone
on the inside.

38:50.127 --> 38:51.185
I'm pretty certain
it's not one of us,

38:51.262 --> 38:52.559
and it's definitely not
His Highness.

38:52.630 --> 38:54.689
So, who does that leave?

38:54.765 --> 38:56.824
- Jennings.
- Exactly.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.334
We need to send a telegram.

38:58.402 --> 39:00.131
I'll wire Scotland Yard,
find out everything they know.

39:00.204 --> 39:02.297
Good man.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.342
You're going to kill us, Eddie.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.605
What has to be done
has to be done.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.546
Just like Maggie Gilpatrick?

39:11.615 --> 39:13.606
Is that why she was murdered?

39:15.286 --> 39:16.218
No.

39:16.287 --> 39:19.484
No, she was killed because she
came to her senses, didn't she?

39:19.557 --> 39:22.025
She realized
that this is not the answer.

39:22.093 --> 39:25.085
Deep down, you know it, too,
don't you?

39:25.162 --> 39:27.687
Eddie, I know how painful
it must have been

39:27.765 --> 39:30.461
to lose your wife and daughter,

39:30.534 --> 39:33.469
but this is no way
to resolve those feelings.

39:37.675 --> 39:40.542
I'm not going to let them
get away with it, Will.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.816
- Sir, I found something.
- So did we.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.152
Listen up!

39:54.225 --> 39:56.193
This just arrived
from the Home Office.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.525
It seems that David Jennings had
a brother who went by an alias.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.064
Tucker.
John Tucker.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.360
Who we know was shot.

40:02.433 --> 40:03.661
But, then, if it was Jennings,

40:03.734 --> 40:05.929
then, I mean, could he have
killed his own brother?

40:06.003 --> 40:07.163
It's a possibility.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.330
What do you have there, Higgins?

40:08.406 --> 40:10.499
I searched high and low
for anything on Eddie, sir.

40:10.574 --> 40:11.541
These are land titles.

40:11.609 --> 40:12.906
Eddie Cullen lived in the city,

40:12.977 --> 40:14.604
but his mother had
a country house.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.202
She left it to him
when she died.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.407
I've done some checking, sir.
No one has lived there since.

40:18.482 --> 40:20.450
Crabtree,
get the carriages ready.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.213
Mulligan, break out the armory.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.356
So, is this what you believe in
now, Eddie?

40:26.424 --> 40:27.652
Killing an innocent man

40:27.725 --> 40:29.488
to avenge the deaths
of innocent people?

40:29.560 --> 40:31.926
That man isn't innocent.

40:31.996 --> 40:33.987
He has the blood of my family
on his hands.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.358
He didn't kill
Abigail and Katie.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.234
He's not responsible.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.535
What happened to the man I knew,
Edward?

40:43.607 --> 40:45.768
The man about to go
into the seminary?

40:45.843 --> 40:48.311
The man who believed
in the sanctity of life?

40:48.379 --> 40:51.780
He died with his family, Will.
He's dead.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.843
I don't believe you.

40:54.919 --> 40:56.443
This is the police!

40:56.520 --> 40:57.782
You're surrounded!

40:57.855 --> 41:00.289
Come out
and throw down your guns!

41:03.527 --> 41:05.461
How'd they find us?

41:10.367 --> 41:11.664
Who snitched?

41:11.735 --> 41:14.727
Who bleeding snitched?

41:15.973 --> 41:18.168
Was it you?

41:18.242 --> 41:19.174
You?

41:19.243 --> 41:20.904
Huh?

41:20.978 --> 41:22.104
You treacherous liars.

41:22.179 --> 41:23.840
I'll kill
the bleeding lot of you.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.313
Jennings!
Nobody snitched.

41:25.382 --> 41:27.714
They just caught up to us.
That's all, all right?

41:27.785 --> 41:30.379
Jennings!
Surrender now!

41:30.454 --> 41:32.979
If you don't,
we're coming in for you.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.960
What are you doing?

41:38.229 --> 41:40.060
Jennings, what are you doing?
Will you stop it?

41:40.130 --> 41:41.722
It's the only way.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.027
The prince dies now.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.362
Are you mad, man?

41:44.435 --> 41:46.926
Shut up!

41:47.938 --> 41:49.838
He dies now.

41:51.442 --> 41:52.932
And we die with him.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.077
Patrick.

41:58.315 --> 41:59.612
Put it down.

41:59.683 --> 42:03.449
Put the bleeding thing down now.
You're not thinking straight.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.853
Why?

42:05.923 --> 42:08.187
Was it you that gave us away?

42:08.259 --> 42:12.093
All your meetings with
your bleeding detective there?

42:12.162 --> 42:14.858
- He didn't say anything.
- Shut up!

42:14.932 --> 42:17.924
He's telling the truth.
I'm with you.

42:18.002 --> 42:20.095
All right?

42:21.639 --> 42:23.300
Well, prove it.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.501
Shoot him.

42:38.589 --> 42:41.683
This what you want now, yeah?

42:41.759 --> 42:43.693
Do it, Cullen.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.228
This what you want, yeah?

42:45.296 --> 42:47.230
Do it!

42:54.738 --> 42:56.797
You're not a killer, Eddie.

43:01.011 --> 43:02.979
Maybe I am.

43:06.116 --> 43:07.447
Eddie!

43:13.924 --> 43:15.391
Drop that gun!
Drop it!

43:18.996 --> 43:20.429
Come on, out!

43:21.699 --> 43:23.189
Your Highness, this way!

43:29.340 --> 43:30.500
Go, go, go!

43:39.116 --> 43:41.311
Eddie, where are you going?

43:41.385 --> 43:43.353
Will, I'll have a noose
around my neck within a week.

43:43.420 --> 43:45.183
No, no.
I'll tell them what you did.

43:45.255 --> 43:46.552
You saved the prince's life.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.285
I'm going off to join my family,
Will.

43:48.359 --> 43:50.054
What?
Eddie.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.288
I'll see you on the other side.
All the best, all right?

43:52.363 --> 43:53.728
No!

43:53.797 --> 43:55.059
Sir, no!

44:11.548 --> 44:13.448
Are you all right?

44:14.685 --> 44:17.483
I fear Eddie died for nothing.

44:19.223 --> 44:21.521
He had a change of heart.

44:21.592 --> 44:23.651
He died heroically.

44:23.727 --> 44:26.855
That's what I keep
trying to convince myself of.

44:26.930 --> 44:29.421
Nothing so important
can ever come too late.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.593
I hope not.

44:33.303 --> 44:36.704
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?

44:39.076 --> 44:41.840
No, William.

44:41.912 --> 44:44.972
I'm just glad you're here.
