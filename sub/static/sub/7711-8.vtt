00:02.636 --> 00:04.772
(Jim)
The Stamford branch
is closing.

00:04.805 --> 00:08.042
And everybody's
just packin' up their stuff.

00:08.076 --> 00:12.246
Andy Bernard
made these tasteful hats.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.149
That's the other thing you
have to watch out--Yo!

00:15.183 --> 00:16.217
Tuna, I want to
talk to you

00:16.250 --> 00:17.785
about this new boss,
Michael Scott.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.153
Yeah?

00:19.187 --> 00:21.122
So what's he like--

00:21.155 --> 00:23.157
likes, dislikes,
favorite sports,

00:23.191 --> 00:25.659
favorite movies,
favorite men's magazines?

00:25.693 --> 00:26.660
You know what?

00:26.694 --> 00:28.262
I think you just
need to meet him.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.763
Playin' your cards
close to the vest?

00:29.797 --> 00:33.301
I get it.
Good luck over there, Tuna.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.603
Cross me,
and I will destroy you.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.473
Sounds good, Andy.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.142
This is gonna be
an adventure.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.777
Yes, this is going to be
very interesting.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.214
All right,
I'm outta here.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.248
See you later?

00:47.281 --> 00:48.616
Right on.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.524
Hey, is that
Josh's computer?
What?

01:01.529 --> 01:03.164
Hey.
Hey.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.165
How'd the run go?

01:04.198 --> 01:05.799
Ah, pretty good.
I finished.

01:05.833 --> 01:06.867
That's great.
Thanks.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.869
[scoffs]
Why is that great?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.804
Because he
accomplished something.

01:10.838 --> 01:11.872
What was your mile time?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.641
About 7.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.244
[scoffs]
I could beat that
on a skateboard.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.378
Well, that
has wheels.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.546
Yeah, well,
my feet don't,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.314
and I could still
crush that time.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.315
Really, Dwight?

01:21.349 --> 01:22.483
How fast are you?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.717
Let's just
put it this way:

01:23.751 --> 01:26.587
Last weekend,
I outran a black pepper snake.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.721
Really?

01:27.755 --> 01:28.722
I am fast.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.258
To give you
a reference point,

01:30.291 --> 01:33.227
I'm somewhere between a snake
and a mongoose.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.895
And a panther.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.231
Man, what is
taking Toby so long?

01:37.265 --> 01:38.866
Oh, I'll just
time him later.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.401
And you'll
compare the times?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.170
Yeah.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.337
Are you ready?

01:43.371 --> 01:45.239
Set, go!
No.
My groin's really tight.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.274
I can't--

01:46.307 --> 01:48.609
[beeping]

01:48.642 --> 01:49.777
[beeping stops]

01:49.810 --> 01:52.646
Am I being mean
to Dwight?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.248
I don't know.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.649
I did just make him
run around the building,

01:55.683 --> 01:57.918
and I have no intention
of timing him.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.453
This isn't even a stopwatch.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.690
It's a digital thermometer.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.625
He does make my life
harder sometimes.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.726
And on purpose.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.861
Like he tried to put meters
on the bathroom stalls

02:07.895 --> 02:10.798
as a way of bringing in
more money for the company.

02:10.831 --> 02:14.368
Hey!
Three more laps to go!

02:14.402 --> 02:16.237
You gotta pick it up
if you're gonna beat Toby!

02:16.270 --> 02:17.805
[Dwight screams]

02:17.838 --> 02:20.908
Well, I should probably
get back to work.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.414
[cheerful music]

02:26.447 --> 02:36.490
*

02:36.490 --> 02:46.500
*

02:56.510 --> 02:57.711
He-e-ere...

02:57.745 --> 02:58.979
Who's here?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.348
Nametag?
Yes, please.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.549
Karen Filipelli.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.583
Karen Filip--

03:02.616 --> 03:04.518
[Italian accent]
Karen a-Filipelli.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.686
Probably Italian.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.221
Possibly Filipino.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.188
Okay.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.558
My branch is absorbing
the Stamford branch.

03:10.591 --> 03:14.795
Or, as I like to put it,
my family is doubling in size.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.730
And that's all
I'm gonna say about it

03:16.764 --> 03:20.468
because I have a gigantic
performance ahead of me

03:20.501 --> 03:23.804
and I have to get
into my head and focus.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.939
[deep breath]

03:25.973 --> 03:27.841
And who's next?
That is Andy Bernard.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.510
Andy Bernard.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.512
If I were you...
St. Bernard.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.847
I would fire
Anthony Gardner...

03:33.881 --> 03:34.948
What?
before noon...

03:34.982 --> 03:36.450
I'm not--
to consolidate power.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.918
I'm not firing somebody
on the first day.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.820
No, no, no, not somebody.
Gardner.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.323
The Japanese camp guards
of World War II

03:42.356 --> 03:44.024
always chose
one man to kill

03:44.057 --> 03:46.527
whenever a batch
of new prisoners arrived.

03:46.560 --> 03:51.832
I always wondered how they
chose the man who was to die.

03:51.865 --> 03:55.836
I think I would have been good
at choosing the person.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.505
Good morning.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.507
You got the food.
Good!

03:59.540 --> 04:00.608
Lookee, lookee, lookee.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.509
What I want you to do--

04:01.542 --> 04:03.511
Set it up
in the conference room, please.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.512
Make it look nice,

04:04.545 --> 04:06.347
as if you were trying to
impress a much older man

04:06.380 --> 04:07.915
who's way out
of your league.
Okay.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.784
[quiet laugh]

04:10.818 --> 04:11.985
Yes, I'm in
a good mood today.

04:12.019 --> 04:16.357
I'm excited to meet
all of the new people

04:16.390 --> 04:19.860
and to see my old friend again,
definitely.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.562
That's always a thing
that makes people happy,

04:21.595 --> 04:24.465
to have
an old friend back.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.733
(woman)
Hello?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.867
(Michael)
Ah! Ding ding
ding ding ding!

04:26.900 --> 04:27.901
Our first arrival.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.303
Welcome to Scranton.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.473
This is
Hannah Smoteridge-Barr.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.574
Hannah Smoteridge-Barr.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.377
Welcome
to our humble abode.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.811
Follow me
to your desk.

04:37.845 --> 04:42.516
Your ball and chain
is right over here.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.452
You know, a lot
of these people,

04:44.485 --> 04:45.519
this is the only family
they have,

04:45.553 --> 04:47.955
so, as far
as I'm concerned,

04:47.988 --> 04:50.758
this says,
"World's Best Dad."

04:51.925 --> 04:53.894
Ah! There he is.

04:53.927 --> 04:54.895
Tony--

04:54.928 --> 04:56.630
What's your last name?
Gardner.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.865
Gardner.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.500
I knew that.
There you go.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.601
Gift bag...

05:00.634 --> 05:02.836
[laughs]
For you, okay?
Thanks.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.738
Michael, I didn't
get a gift bag.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.839
Well, they're
just for guests.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.675
If there are any left over,
you can buy one later.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.109
My bag's mostly pencils.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.844
Ooh...and coupons

05:10.878 --> 05:12.980
to various hot spots
around Scranton.

05:13.013 --> 05:13.981
All right,
let me show you

05:14.014 --> 05:16.650
to your area, sir.

05:16.684 --> 05:17.818
Come on, big guy.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.086
Can I have your pencils?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.087
No.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.722
Hi.
Hi.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.891
I'm Pam.
Karen.
I love your sweater.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.360
Oh, thanks.
My mom made it for me.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.961
Really?
That's so cool.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.697
I've always wanted to
learn how to knit.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.399
Welcome,
welcome, welcome!

05:31.432 --> 05:34.635
[imitating robot]
Take me
to your leader.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.438
Oh, wait.
I am your leader.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.908
Uh, wait,
are you a robot

05:40.941 --> 05:42.643
or a Martian?

05:42.676 --> 05:45.045
Hmm? Ah...
[laughs]

05:45.078 --> 05:47.147
I'm actually your boss,
Michael Scott.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.516
Hi. Karen.
Welcome.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.017
Wow, you are
very exotic-looking.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.019
Was your dad a G.I.,
or...?

06:02.563 --> 06:05.399
I'll be the number two guy
here in Scranton in six weeks.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.266
How?

06:06.299 --> 06:08.101
Name repetition,
personality mirroring,

06:08.135 --> 06:10.871
and never
breaking off a handshake.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.441
I'm always thinking
one step ahead,

06:13.474 --> 06:14.975
like a...

06:15.008 --> 06:16.444
carpenter...

06:16.477 --> 06:18.145
that makes stairs.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.847
[clears throat]

06:19.880 --> 06:21.449
Hello.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.585
Ah!
You must be Andy Bernard.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.954
Aloha and welcome.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.756
And you must be
Michael Scott.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.825
Aloha and hello.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.627
[laughs]
Very good.

06:33.661 --> 06:37.431
Welcome to
our little kingdom.

06:37.465 --> 06:41.134
Uh, we have a bag
of nifty gifties for you.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.571
Well, Michael, thank you
for welcoming me

06:43.604 --> 06:45.473
to your little kingdom,
Mike.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.174
Oh.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.175
Nifty!

06:48.208 --> 06:49.943
They are nifty.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.745
They're nifty gifties.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.013
You know
who I really like

06:53.046 --> 06:54.682
is this guy Andy Bernard.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.718
He has got this
very likeable way about him.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.155
Which is why they
need a passing game.
Right.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.592
(Michael)
No way.
Get him outta here.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.193
We don't want any
of this kind in here.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.728
Good to see you, man.
Wow. Okay.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.830
How are you?
Martin Nash, I presume?

07:09.863 --> 07:12.500
This is a little gift bag
for you, free of charge.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.701
Follow me.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.536
I will show you
where all the slaves work.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.604
Not...

07:16.637 --> 07:19.106
So your desk is...

07:19.139 --> 07:20.708
Hi. I'm Jim.
I'm new here.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.775
Oh, my God!
It's really you.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.210
[laughs]

07:23.243 --> 07:24.778
I was just doin'
a little joke there

07:24.812 --> 07:25.813
about how
we'd never met.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.880
I know.
I don't care.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.181
Awesome.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.917
Good to be back.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.519
The place
looks really good.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.686
It's really good
to see you.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.987
You too.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.690
Where do I stand
with Pam?

07:36.724 --> 07:39.560
Um...no idea.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.495
I mean, we're friends.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.930
Always have been friends.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.233
Um, that
is where we stand.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.801
(Dwight)
Well, well, well.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.871
Look what the cat
dragged in from Stamford.

07:50.904 --> 07:51.639
Hey, Dwight.

07:51.672 --> 07:55.776
Fact: I am older.
I am wiser.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.710
Do not mess
with me.

07:56.744 --> 07:59.513
Okay.
Sounds good.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.214
What are you doing?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.650
Do I have a spider
on my forehead?

08:02.683 --> 08:03.817
No. Look good.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.786
Why are you looking
at my forehead?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.588
I'm not.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.623
Meet my eye line, Jim.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.824
I am.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.159
Stop acting
like an idiot!

08:12.192 --> 08:14.094
Okay.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.162
(Ryan)
Hey, buddy.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.864
Welcome back.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.798
Hey, how are you, man?
Good to see you.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.899
I'm good.
How are you?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.137
So...

08:24.171 --> 08:25.238
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.239
Are you
sitting here now?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.175
Yeah.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.276
Oh.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.580
Um...

08:32.613 --> 08:35.215
unless you really, really
want it back.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.018
You know, man,
it's really your call.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.753
Cool. Thank you.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.022
Mm-hmm.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.991
Let me get that
for you.

08:45.793 --> 08:46.827
You got it?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.295
Mm-hmm.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.266
This one taken?
No? Good.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.238
Yeah,
Jim is a nice guy.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.341
That's why
I got the desk.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.677
Hey, this came
with the Stamford people.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.978
Can you
take care of it?

09:05.012 --> 09:08.616
Oh, yes, I can.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.850
In general,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.185
they do not give me
much responsibility,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.856
but they do let me
shred the company documents.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.759
And that is really
all I need.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.066
Michael Scott,
thank you.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.068
I appreciate it,
Mike.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.236
(Michael)
All right.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.704
Hello.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.806
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.975
Dwight Schrute--
assistant regional manager.

09:35.008 --> 09:38.245
Andy Bernard, regional director
in charge of sales.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.647
So you'll be
reporting to me then.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.848
Mmm...on the contrary.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.015
My title
has "manager" in it.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.051
And I'm a director,

09:44.084 --> 09:47.054
which on a film set
is the highest title there is.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.956
Do you know anything
about film?

09:48.989 --> 09:50.891
I know everything
about film.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.961
I've seen over 240
of them.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.328
Congratulations.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.937
Hey, Toby.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.205
Hey, Jim.
How are you, man?

10:05.238 --> 10:06.774
Oh, really good.
I just wanted to
say hi.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.709
How are you?
Hey, welcome back.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.011
Oh, is that, like,
your new thing or...?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.913
No. I'm sorry.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.247
No.
That's cool.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.983
No, it's not.
We'll just...

10:20.087 --> 10:21.121
All right,
good to be back.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.122
Okay.
All right.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.256
All right,
sorry about that.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.257
No problem.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.660
It was--
What?

10:26.694 --> 10:27.695
Nothing.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.233
[whirring]

10:33.266 --> 10:35.202
This thing
is so awesome.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.737
It will shred anything.

10:36.770 --> 10:40.273
Ooh!
It will shred a CD.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.408
[crunching]

10:41.441 --> 10:42.976
It will shred...

10:45.078 --> 10:46.780
A credit card.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.116
It'll shred--

10:49.149 --> 10:51.218
Oh...

10:51.251 --> 10:52.285
[shredder stops]

10:52.319 --> 10:53.386
Shoot.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.856
"I present
the orientation video."

10:55.889 --> 10:56.890
We need to talk.

10:56.924 --> 10:57.891
Not now.

10:57.925 --> 10:58.892
Which is higher,

10:58.926 --> 11:00.127
assistant regional manager

11:00.160 --> 11:01.995
or regional director
in charge of sales?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.697
I told you,
the titles are irrelevant.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.098
They just relate
to pay scale.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.734
Okay, so who gets
paid more, me or Andy?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.702
It is not a matter
of more or less.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.037
Your pay
is just different,

11:10.070 --> 11:11.404
okay?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.741
All right.
Show time, part one.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.942
Okay, who
reports to who?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.476
I don't care.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.145
Dwight, you all
report to me.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.713
That's all that matters.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.749
The rest of it just work out
amongst yourselves, okay?

11:21.782 --> 11:23.784
And then if I want--
Work it out
amongst yourselves!

11:23.817 --> 11:25.786
I--
Please!
I have a company to run.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.887
Will you let me
run the company?

11:26.920 --> 11:27.888
I--
Will you?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.023
One--
Please?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.462
Jim!
Kelly.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.396
Oh, ho!

11:36.429 --> 11:38.431
Oh, my God!
I have so much to tell you.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.266
Really?

11:39.299 --> 11:40.801
Yes. Tom Cruise
and Katie Holmes,

11:40.834 --> 11:42.803
They had a baby,
and they named it Suri.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.271
And then Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie,

11:44.304 --> 11:46.740
they had a baby, too,
and they named it Shiloh.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.743
And both babies
are amazing!

11:49.777 --> 11:50.744
Great.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.312
What's new with you?

11:52.345 --> 11:53.847
I just told you.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.151
Okay, everybody
settled in?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.219
Good.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.788
Why don't we all proceed

12:00.821 --> 12:02.422
into the conference room?

12:02.455 --> 12:06.426
Or, should I say,
the banquet hall?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.762
For--
drumroll, please--

12:08.796 --> 12:11.198
[imitating drumroll]

12:12.565 --> 12:16.937
The official Merger Day
All-Family Welcome Breakfast.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.071
Come on in.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.472
Don't be shy.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.775
[employees murmuring]

12:21.809 --> 12:22.843
Hey, champagne.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.845
No, no.
Guests only.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.347
Smoked salmon.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.049
No--um,
for the guests, it is.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.818
For you,
consider it cow meat.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.819
Strictly taboo.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.619
I eat beef.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.222
Well, then consider it
poisoned beef.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.223
No touching.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.357
The beef
is poisoned?

12:37.390 --> 12:40.260
No, it's not bee--
just...sit down, please.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.529
Welcome.
Help yourself.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.865
You may want
these orientation materials.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.433
Wrong, Toby.

12:46.466 --> 12:50.070
This is an orientation,
not a bore-ientation.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.538
Okay...

12:51.571 --> 12:52.806
Do not worry.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.041
All of your questions

12:54.074 --> 12:55.575
are about to be answered.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.210
Cell phones
and pagers off, please.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.812
Oh, this looks promising.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.013
You won't
be disappointed.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.248
(Michael)
Let's face it.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.917
Moving to a new job
can be very stressful.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.253
So I have made
an orientation video

13:06.286 --> 13:08.989
especially
for you newcomers.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.893
But it's not like
any orientation video

13:12.926 --> 13:15.028
that any of you
have ever seen.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.030
It's funny.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.333
It's got a little bit
of a zing to it.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.170
And I hope that it
gives you a flavor

13:23.203 --> 13:27.240
of what we're all about here
at Dunder-Mifflin

13:27.274 --> 13:29.376
and what we're all about
here in Scranton.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.312
So let's just all
laugh together and watch...

13:32.345 --> 13:34.982
Lazy Scranton.
[hip-hop music]

13:35.015 --> 13:37.484
* Sittin' in my office
with a pint of grilled bacon *

13:37.517 --> 13:39.887
* Called the man twice
just to see what was shakin' *

13:39.920 --> 13:42.155
* Yo, Mike, our town
is dope and pretty *

13:42.189 --> 13:43.891
* So check out
how we live *

13:43.924 --> 13:45.158
* In the
Electric City *

13:45.192 --> 13:46.326
* They call it
Scranton *

13:46.359 --> 13:48.328
* What
* The Electric City

13:48.361 --> 13:49.396
* Scranton
* What

13:49.429 --> 13:50.864
* The Electric City

13:50.898 --> 13:52.032
* Call Poison Control

13:52.065 --> 13:53.466
* If you're bit
by a spider *

13:53.500 --> 13:55.002
* But check
that it's covered *

13:55.035 --> 13:56.569
* By your
health care provider *

13:56.603 --> 13:58.538
It reminds me
of the orientation video

13:58.571 --> 14:00.440
Michael showed
on my first day:

14:00.473 --> 14:03.110
The Scranton Witch Project.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.945
I am so scared

14:04.978 --> 14:08.348
when people don't label
their personal food.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.984
* You lack coal mines
and you wanna see 'em *

14:11.018 --> 14:12.119
* Well, check it out,
yo *

14:12.152 --> 14:13.620
* The Anthracite
Museum *

14:13.653 --> 14:14.922
(Dwight)
* Plenty of space

14:14.955 --> 14:16.189
* In the parking lot

14:16.223 --> 14:18.658
* But the little cars go
in the compact spot *

14:18.691 --> 14:21.061
* Spot, spot, spot

14:21.094 --> 14:24.664
Well, so far,
I think it is killing.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.567
I thought it would
either be an A or an A-plus.

14:27.600 --> 14:34.174
But I completely forgot
that there is an A-plus-plus.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.442
This is Karen Filipelli.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.509
Please leave a message.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.078
Terrible.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.113
Totally unconvincing.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.116
This is Karen Filipelli.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.052
Please leave a message.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.354
Not bad,
but you are Italian,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.622
so try it
more Italian.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.062
[Italian accent]
This is Karen Filipelli.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.429
Please leave-a me
the message.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.231
Abbondanza.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.599
You feel good?
Mm-hmm.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.633
All right.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.506
[flatly]
Karen Filipelli.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.611
Hey, buddy.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.346
Anything new to report?

15:13.380 --> 15:17.317
Do you mean to me
from you?

15:17.350 --> 15:19.486
'Cause that's
how it works.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.957
Sure thing, buddy.

15:26.726 --> 15:30.163
(Andy)
Am I trying to get
under his skin?

15:30.197 --> 15:33.466
Yes, because
the angrier he gets,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.335
the more marginalized
he becomes.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.205
Meanwhile,
Andy Bernard is out there

15:38.238 --> 15:40.707
layin' on the charm.

15:40.740 --> 15:45.178
Hey, Angela,
check this out.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.181
It's my new screensaver.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.182
Oh.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.250
Do you like it?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.751
I do like it,
actually.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.353
Thank you.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.456
You have...

15:56.489 --> 15:59.292
such a pretty smile,
by the way.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.460
Thank you.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.395
You're welcome.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.464
Hey.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.565
Hey.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.134
What happened
to grape soda?

16:07.167 --> 16:08.235
Oh, yeah.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.237
I'm trying to move away
from that.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.439
I'm getting into more
of a bottled water phase.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.307
Oh, you've
changed so much.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.277
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.778
So when do I
get to hear everything?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.413
Are you still
getting unpacked?

16:20.447 --> 16:23.183
Or you want to grab a coffee
or something after work?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.184
Oh, um...

16:24.217 --> 16:25.518
Tonight, actually?
No.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.753
I'm just still
getting settled.

16:26.786 --> 16:27.754
Oh, yeah. No.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.122
You know, whenever.
Okay.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.458
O...kay.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.593
Sorry to interrupt.
I--

16:33.626 --> 16:35.462
Nope, you're not
interrupting anything.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.131
Nope. I'm--
(Michael)
All right.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.132
Don't.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.133
Okay.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.035
All right.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.270
[chuckling]

16:43.303 --> 16:45.338
I should probably
get back to work.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.373
Back to work.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.041
Yeah, I know.
Me too.
All right.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.347
The day's going fine.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.484
It's been a little chaotic,
but it's fine.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.319
It's great.

16:59.352 --> 17:03.056
A lot of distractions,
but it's good.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.093
[machine pumping]

17:07.694 --> 17:10.263
Take a picture.
It'll last longer.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.433
I'm sorry, it's just...
It's a little distracting.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.535
Ditto that,
my brother.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.188
Look what's
on his computer.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.191
What is that,
a squid's eye or...?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.659
It's my left breast.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.495
How did you--

17:42.529 --> 17:44.264
Right place
at the right time.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.136
Oh.
What's that smell?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.203
What smell?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.838
It's...

17:51.871 --> 17:55.642
Must be air freshener
plugged in somewhere.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.477
It smells
like a funeral home.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.146
Oh, I'll help you
find it.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.617
Oh, you know what?
Never--never mind.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.852
What is it?

18:05.885 --> 18:06.886
I--I think

18:06.919 --> 18:09.122
I'm just allergic
to your perfume.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.757
My perfume?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.592
It's just
my crazy nose.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.626
I'm, um...

18:13.660 --> 18:16.196
used to different smells.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.298
Bob Vance bought
this perfume for me

18:18.331 --> 18:19.866
in metropolitan Orlando.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.768
It's made from real pine.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.503
Who's Bob Vance?

18:23.536 --> 18:26.539
You have a lot to learn
about this town, sweetie.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.844
I don't know who these new
people think they are.

18:31.878 --> 18:35.848
I've sat downwind of Phyllis'
stinky perfumes for years.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.717
Never said a word.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.586
People hate people
that are different from them.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.787
That's natural.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.490
But you know what makes people
forget their differences?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.857
A great show.

18:44.891 --> 18:48.228
That is why I created
the integration celebration.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.296
This is the moment

18:49.329 --> 18:52.665
when Scranton and Stamford
come together as one,

18:52.699 --> 18:55.468
united in applause.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.439
I know what a lot of you
must be thinking.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.274
"Wow, what a day.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.709
"It feels more like
a night at a party

19:02.742 --> 19:03.876
than a day at work."

19:03.910 --> 19:06.679
Well, in my opinion,

19:06.713 --> 19:10.650
business should feel
like a night out,

19:10.683 --> 19:12.585
a night...

19:12.619 --> 19:14.287
at...

19:17.257 --> 19:18.558
the Roxbury.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.295
Okay, there's
supposed to be music.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.563
And it's--I got it!
I got it!

19:23.596 --> 19:25.332
Dwight, just...

19:25.365 --> 19:26.899
Do you have batteries
in that?
Stupid.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.501
Um...

Why is my nose so itchy?

Uh, probably because
of all the nose candy.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.242
[laughing]

20:09.276 --> 20:10.310
I told you these guys
have a sense of humor.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.678
Very funny, Michael.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.313
Okay, okay.
All right.
Really funny, Michael.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.414
All right, all right,
I'm on a roll.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.717
Why are the new people
on the table?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.419
To show them

20:19.452 --> 20:21.854
that we
are not above them.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.756
Shouldn't we be equals?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.958
Not today.
No.

Tony, please
join your cohorts

20:29.729 --> 20:32.299

if you would.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.868
Uh, this is difficult
for me.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.371
Hey, I understand.
We're all friends.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.039
No, I mean,
I can't physically.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.641
I can't get
on the table.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.510
Oh, well...

20:43.543 --> 20:46.746
just use the momentum

20:46.779 --> 20:50.617
of your lower half
to hoist yourself up.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.651
Okay?

You know what?
I'll help.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.392
I will help.
No. Please...

20:59.426 --> 21:00.259
don't.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.429
Don't be shy.
Dwight, let's do this.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.430
Come on.
We're doin' this thing.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.964
Ready? On three.
Let's get up.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.466
One, two--
Bend at the knees.

Go!
Okay,
here we go!

Here we go.

I'm under this hock here.

I don't know what
I'm grabbin' here.

All right, all right, stop.
Put me down.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.476
Put me down.
Push it! Push it!

21:16.509 --> 21:17.276
I'm right
in your crack.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.878
Put me down now!
You're almost there!

21:18.911 --> 21:20.347
Put me down
right now!

You've got it.

Hey, hey. Easy.
Easy.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.454
I'm sorry.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.521
Don't--

21:28.555 --> 21:31.458
It's just not
going to work for me.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.092
I have to go.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.328
I don't understand.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.429
I was on the fence
about this,

21:36.463 --> 21:39.432
and it's just
not a good fit.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.867
Well, we'll
squeeze you in.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.702
I can't work here.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.437
I have to quit.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.941
You can't quit
on the first day.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.644
That's...
heresy, my friend.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.413
Okay, let's
talk about this.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.482
What happened?
I mean, what--

21:56.483 --> 21:57.850
Was it Toby?

21:57.884 --> 21:59.386
Did he say something?

21:59.419 --> 22:01.688
'Cause he's...
Like...

22:01.721 --> 22:05.492
No, Toby was helpful.
He was very kind.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.727
It's just
your management style.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.564
My management style?

22:11.598 --> 22:14.100
So...

22:14.133 --> 22:16.403
Didn't you think
Lazy Scranton was funny?

22:16.436 --> 22:17.904
No.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.406
Was it supposed to be funny?

22:19.439 --> 22:21.441
Okay, well...

22:23.142 --> 22:25.578
Don't bother quitting
because you're fired.

22:25.612 --> 22:26.913
Excuse me?

22:26.946 --> 22:28.548
You are fired!

22:28.581 --> 22:31.451
I'm sorry, but we don't
have quitters on this team.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.752
Just clean out
your desk!

22:32.785 --> 22:35.054
But there's nothing
in my desk except coupons.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.989
Don't try to apologize
to me, man.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.925
It's too late.
Just get out.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.495
Take your bad vibes
with you.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.431
That was my advice,
remember?

22:44.464 --> 22:45.832
I'm the one who suggested
that you fire him.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.034
Probably the best advice
you ever gave me, Dwight.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.702
And what advice

22:49.736 --> 22:52.972
has Andy given to you today
that you have acted on?

22:53.005 --> 22:55.742
Would "none" be
an accurate estimate?

22:55.775 --> 22:57.710
None advice?

22:57.744 --> 23:00.547
[whispers]
Fire Andy.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.849
Fire...Andy.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.952
Dwight may have
won the battle,

23:05.985 --> 23:10.590
but I will win
the next battle.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.390
Tony was right.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.426
This environment
is dysfunctional.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.428
Well, maybe that's
because some people treat it

23:15.462 --> 23:17.096
like their own private
Hooters strip club.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.966
Whoa, Angela.
Hold on.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.601
Hooters is a restaurant

23:21.634 --> 23:23.870
with over 400 locations
worldwide.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.605
Back to work.
We don't have to get along.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.973
We just have to work
together.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.008
No, we do
have to get along.

23:29.041 --> 23:32.078
Can't we all
just get along?

23:32.111 --> 23:36.215
Or have we forgotten the words
of the Reverend King?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.918
The word "merger"
comes from the word "marriage."

23:38.951 --> 23:40.887
And that was what today
was supposed to be.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.056
The loving union
between people.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.026
Instead, it has become like...

23:47.059 --> 23:50.497
when my mom
moved in with Jeff.

23:50.530 --> 23:54.233
And, once again,
it becomes my job to fix it.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.535
(Michael)
Hey!

23:55.568 --> 23:56.536
Hey, everybody!

23:56.569 --> 23:57.604
Something happened!

23:57.637 --> 23:59.672
Those guys
from Vance Refrigeration,

23:59.706 --> 24:01.140
they let the air
out of our tires.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.809
What?!
Yeah!
They punked us!

24:02.842 --> 24:04.477
They punked us good.
Come on.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.812
Come on.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.583
Does Bob Vance work
for Vance Refrigeration?

24:10.617 --> 24:12.084
Does he ever.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.059
Man, they
got us so bad.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.629
We cannot let 'em
get away with this.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.197
We have got to
pull together as one

24:25.231 --> 24:26.533
and steal
their refrigerators.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.967
Yeah!
Yeah?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.869
I don't think
we can do that.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.037
Go home, Toby.
Just...

24:31.070 --> 24:32.505
(Martin)
Hey!

24:32.539 --> 24:33.840
Why doesn't your car
have a flat tire?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.141
Why?
I will tell you why.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.711
Because they saved
the worst for me.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.681
They put a hate note
under my windshield wiper.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.082
Check this out.
It's so hateful.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.751
"You guys suck!

24:44.784 --> 24:46.819
"You can never
pull together as one

24:46.853 --> 24:47.920
"and revenge us.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.689
That is why
you suck."

24:49.722 --> 24:51.223

For crying out loud.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.159
No. No, no, no, no.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.661
No.
You are falling for it.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.028
You are playing
right into their hands.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.564
This is just what
they want you to do.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.831
Man, what is with
this guy?

24:58.865 --> 25:00.900
(Stanley)
God, now I'll
try to explain.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.173
(Michael)
This is egregious!

25:08.875 --> 25:11.744
This is egregious!

25:11.778 --> 25:14.046
Trust me,
it only gets worse.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.314
Is he always like this?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.116
Sometimes he brings
more costumes.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.251
Hmm.
When do people work?

25:19.285 --> 25:22.054
Oh, we find little times
during the day.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.690
How are we
gonna get home?

25:23.723 --> 25:25.091
Bob Vance
has an air pump.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.326
He said he'd fill all
our tires up.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.295
Bob Vance
of Vance Refrigeration.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.063
Hmm.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.799
See that?

25:32.832 --> 25:34.333
Mission accomplished.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.603
They're like a bunch
of fourth graders.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.005
Sometimes what brings
the kids together

25:39.038 --> 25:41.107
is hating
the lunch lady.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.775
Although that'll change

25:42.809 --> 25:45.912
because by the end
of the fourth grade,

25:45.945 --> 25:47.914
the lunch lady
was actually the person

25:47.947 --> 25:50.149
I hung out with
the most.

[Jan on phone]
Michael!
Hi, Jan.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.592
Did you fire Tony Gardner
when he was trying to quit?

25:59.626 --> 26:03.095
I did.
Major personnel crisis averted.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.296
Compliment accepted.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.965
Do you realize,
Michael,

26:05.998 --> 26:08.334
that we now have to
pay him severance?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.169
Yes.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.871
You do?

26:11.904 --> 26:15.007
But do you realize that
that was actually Dwight's idea?

26:15.041 --> 26:16.876
Bad advice
from my number two.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.010
What?
No. no.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.112
No, Jim
is your number two.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.247
What?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.983
He's the only one who's
worked with both groups.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.986
I sent you a memo
about this.

26:27.019 --> 26:32.024
Yes, I know that,
for I do read the memos.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.960
So, after a great deal
of thought

26:33.993 --> 26:35.628
and introspective-shun,

26:35.662 --> 26:37.229
I have decided
to make Jim

26:37.263 --> 26:39.265
my new number two.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.168
If he even wants it.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.703
It doesn't come
with a pay raise.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.404
No, it does, actually.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.741
So who will be
your new number three?

26:48.775 --> 26:51.010
Uh, that I have not
decided yet.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.679
Michael, I would just
like to say

26:52.712 --> 26:55.014
that you have handled
this entire situation

26:55.047 --> 26:57.049
with great aplomb.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.385
Thank you, Andy.
That's very kind.

26:59.418 --> 27:01.654
And I have to say
that your leadership--

27:01.688 --> 27:02.655
Shut it.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.656
Shut it.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.024
That's...

27:06.793 --> 27:08.127
[whispers]
Suck-up.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.164
[cell phone rings]

27:13.733 --> 27:16.035
Hey.
Where you at, Filipelli?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.805
[Karen on phone]
I'm at the grocery store
buying a corkscrew

27:18.838 --> 27:20.206
to give myself
a lobotomy.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.774
[laughs]

27:21.808 --> 27:23.409
What's wrong, you didn't
have a good first day?

27:23.442 --> 27:25.044
Oh, my God.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.013
Hey, you want to meet
at Cooper's in an hour?

27:27.046 --> 27:28.180
I need a drink.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.149
Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.718
I--

27:31.751 --> 27:32.885
Hey, you know what?

27:32.919 --> 27:34.086
Can I give you a call
right back?

27:34.120 --> 27:35.187
Yeah.
Okay. Thanks.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.189
Okay.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.025
(Jim)
Hey.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.092
Hey.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.994
I thought you
had already left.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.129
Uh...no.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.897
I just had some

27:44.931 --> 27:46.332
other stuff
I had to do.
Oh, good.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.433
What's up?

27:47.466 --> 27:49.235
Oh, nothing.
I just feel bad.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.302
I feel like things
were a little weird today

27:50.336 --> 27:51.303
or something.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.939
What do you mean?

27:52.972 --> 27:55.708
I just think
I should tell you

27:55.742 --> 27:58.444
that I've sort of
started seeing someone,

27:58.477 --> 28:00.146
Oh.
and, uh...

28:00.179 --> 28:01.748
That's totally cool.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.716
You can do
whatever you want.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.152
Oh. Okay, uh...

28:06.185 --> 28:07.720
Good.

28:07.754 --> 28:08.988
We're friends.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.256
We'll always be friends.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.058
Right.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.261
It's good
to have you back.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.295
Yeah.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.330
Good to be back.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.476
[shredder whirring]

28:32.845 --> 28:34.847
[shredder stops]

28:38.150 --> 28:39.986
Where'd you
get that salad?

28:41.020 --> 28:42.354
Staples.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.995
Saw your dorkmobile
in the parking lot.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.396
What does it get,
like 4 miles to the gallon?

28:50.429 --> 28:52.031
Uh, try double that.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.032
Classic Trans Am,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.166
vintage American muscle.

28:54.200 --> 28:54.901
Please.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.869
Yeah.
My Xterra's pretty sweet.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.805
Luxurious yet rugged.

28:58.838 --> 28:59.972
Leave it
to the Japanese.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.774
Xterra's not even
a real word.

29:01.808 --> 29:02.809
Actually, it is.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.410
It's Latin for "earth."

29:04.443 --> 29:06.078
Oh, so you drive
an Xearth.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.379
Yeah.
That makes sense.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.082
I'd rather drive
a classic Trans Am

29:10.116 --> 29:12.084
than an Xearth.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.219
Yeah, I bet you would.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.287
Oh, uh, by the way,
1985 called.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.522
It wants its car back.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.557
Well, I hope 1985
has a time machine

29:18.590 --> 29:19.992
'cause I drive an '87.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.027
Oh, speaking
of time machines,

29:21.060 --> 29:22.494
I just got back
from the future,

29:22.528 --> 29:23.529
and I went
to your funeral

29:23.562 --> 29:24.797
and guess what?

29:24.831 --> 29:26.098
Nobody came.

29:26.132 --> 29:26.933
Speaking of funerals,

29:26.966 --> 29:30.336
why don't you go ahead
and go die?

29:30.369 --> 29:33.039
Oh, that was a really...

29:33.072 --> 29:34.506
well-constructed sentence.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.542
You should be
an English professor

29:36.575 --> 29:39.445
at Cor-not University.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.180
Idiot.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.582
If I were an idiot,
I'd be driving a Trans Am.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.084
If you were
driving a Trans Am,

29:45.117 --> 29:47.920
you would be the smartest idiot
in the whole world.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.155
[coughing]

29:49.188 --> 29:50.256
Idiot.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.290
Ahem.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.125
[coughing]
You're the idiot.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.294
[coughing]
Nice comeback.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.964
I was making fun
of your comeback.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.298
That's why it worked.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.904
I totally got the best
of that interchange.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.138
[coughing]
