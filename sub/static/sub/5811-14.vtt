00:02.200 --> 00:03.610
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.760 --> 00:05.091
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.320 --> 00:09.041
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.240 --> 00:10.605
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

00:10.840 --> 00:12.604
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

00:12.760 --> 00:15.445
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:15.680 --> 00:18.445
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:18.840 --> 00:19.921
Previously on Arrow...

00:20.120 --> 00:21.451
Someone else is
throwing their hat in the ring.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.364
- Who?
- Ruvé Adams.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.281
I'm Oliver.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.761
<i>He can't know that you're
his father. And nobody else can.</i>

00:28.040 --> 00:30.122
I know who Oliver Queen cares about
more than anyone.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.361
Who?

00:31.560 --> 00:33.961
His son. William.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.966
<i>Merritt Davis will be
moderating the debate.</i>

00:38.200 --> 00:40.806
There <i>'II be</i> a <i>podium there,
another one there.</i>

00:41.040 --> 00:42.644
And according to tradition,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.804
the selection's made
by some coin-toss thingy.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.485
Mr. Queen.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.407
At last, we meet.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.481
Ms. Adams.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.802
I'm just curious,
is Adams your maiden name?

00:55.040 --> 00:56.644
Oh, I'm not married, actually.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.801
- Really?
- Mmm.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.804
Well, I'm sure you just haven't
met the right person yet.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.284
Well, it is lovely to finally meet you.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.167
An unconventional candidate,
to say the least.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.446
Bit of a dark horse yourself.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.971
Just meaning that your candidacy
seems to have come out of nowhere.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.847
Well, generally, I prefer to keep
my philanthropic works quiet,

01:15.080 --> 01:18.004
but the city is in simply too much trouble
for me to remain in the shadows.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.241
Yes, it is.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.683
The people destroying our homes
need to be fought in the light of day.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.521
Well, I hope that we have
a productive debate, Mr. Queen.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.761
I look forward to it.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.610
Ms. Adams.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.689
More like Mrs. Deceitful Darhk.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.206
I feel like "Adams" probably polls better.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.441
You know, it's not like we can prove

01:37.640 --> 01:38.846
that Adams isn't her real last name.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.604
How is our opposition research coming?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.848
Nothing yet.
She's apparently clean.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.044
But the more we do digging
into her and her background,

01:46.280 --> 01:48.681
<i>the more likely
she is gonna dig into ours.</i>

01:48.960 --> 01:49.961
I think that's our cue.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.044
Hey, wait, I really need you to take a
look at these engagement-party invites.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.685
My mom's been hounding me.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.126
The envelope is very pink.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.689
I know. Wait, don't...

01:59.080 --> 02:00.081
Open it.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.611
You should've totally
seen that one coming.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.801
I'm so sorry.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.843
- What do you think?
- Maybe less glitter.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.041
You look good in glitter.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.611
Yeah, let's move out.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.445
The valet's bringing up her car.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.766
All right, Laurel's got the eyeball.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.485
You should move.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.000
Are you gonna be all right in here?

02:22.240 --> 02:24.083
Oh, yeah. Great Wi-Fi.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.606
Overwatch on.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.286
I've got her approaching 7th.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.925
<i>You think she's headed to her house again?</i>

02:33.120 --> 02:35.168
Like she did the last six times
we trailed her, you mean?

02:35.360 --> 02:36.805
She has to be coordinating
with Darhk somehow.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.321
We keep this up, we learn how,
we find out where he is.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.045
I've run out of roof.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.685
I'm On it.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.565
<i>If she turns left on Wilson,
she'll be headed home.</i>

02:45.760 --> 02:48.047
She's not. Right turn.
Could be our lucky night.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.321
Speedy, you're it.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.166
Got her.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.648
<i>Green Arrow,
are you ready for the handoff?</i>

03:02.840 --> 03:04.330
Already there.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.727
<i>I've got eyes on.</i>

03:24.800 --> 03:26.165
- <i>I lost</i> her.
- What do you mean?

03:26.360 --> 03:27.566
That pursuit was textbook.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.204
You had an appointment
with my husband the other week.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.046
He does not take kindly to being stood up.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.086
And he has a little something to say
about you stalking his wife as well.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.041
FELICITYI Are you all right?

04:12.240 --> 04:14.049
She got away again.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.844
Okay. So clearly, we're not gonna
find Darhk by tailing his wife.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.765
Yeah, well, it's not like we have
a lot of moves left to make.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.083
Darhk has gone, well, dark,
ever since Machin attacked his family.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.203
Darhk is not afraid of Machin.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.006
He's just...
His plan's gone to a new phase.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.440
But how do you know that?

04:42.640 --> 04:44.881
Because HIVE spent months
trying to cripple this city's leadership.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.525
They discouraged people
from running for mayor.

04:46.760 --> 04:48.330
They even tried to co-opt my candidacy.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.602
Yeah, then Mrs. Evil
threw her hat in the ring.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.801
There has to be a reason.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.483
Darhk did not try and destroy Star City
so that his wife could be mayor.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.363
There's something that we're not seeing.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.561
<i>Oh, I can see it.</i>

05:00.760 --> 05:03.570
Clear as day.
You on the podium, Thursday night,

05:03.760 --> 05:07.287
vexing Oliver Queen
with your political legerdemain.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.609
Until we take him out
of the game completely, you mean.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.411
Oh, you're not reconsidering the plan?

05:14.600 --> 05:18.605
Malcolm Merlyn reached out,
gave me an early birthday present.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.723
It would be a shame not to make use of it.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.611
Ah! My buddies.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.443
Let's get the rest of
the organization on the line.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.365
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:35.600 --> 05:40.606
I am giddy to report that
Phase 4 is proceeding on schedule.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.407
There's still some concern
about the Star City operation.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.806
Enlighten me.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.765
Phase 5 requires control over City Hall.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.645
Yet, somehow, we've found ourselves

05:51.840 --> 05:54.923
mired in a petty political race
to see that happen.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.447
We didn't exactly plan
on Oliver Queen, did we?

05:57.640 --> 05:58.721
No one ever does.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.682
<i>I think what Mr. Armitage
is too polite to say</i>

06:03.920 --> 06:05.684
<i>is that Phase 5 now rests</i>

06:05.920 --> 06:10.801
<i>on your wife's questionable
political acumen.</i>

06:12.840 --> 06:15.684
Tomas, how is Madrid this time of year?

06:16.200 --> 06:19.090
I remember taking a siesta
in your office, once.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.601
I can practically picture
the room right now.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.531
As if I'm actually in it.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.965
Okay, then. Anything else to cover?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.407
Well, there is the matter
of Quentin Lance.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.080
He's clearly been aiding the vigilantes.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.361
I can confirm as much.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.846
Don't worry.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.209
That loose end is about to be well tied.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.806
Hi.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.651
Hey, time for my 8:00 feed already?

06:48.880 --> 06:51.121
Funny. I thought you could use
a little pick-me-up.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.608
I think you used that excuse last week
to check up on me.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.451
DA's office never worked
with my department so much.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.330
I'm just... I'm worried about you.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.561
No kidding.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.000
No, Dad, seriously.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.690
Darhk has to know that you're the one that

07:03.880 --> 07:05.325
gave up the Ghost base of operations.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.285
And I go to work every day
surrounded by men and women with guns.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.687
It is all right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.689
Hello. Lance. Yeah.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.
I'll be there in 10.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.322
I've got a possible 602.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.760
Isn't that a little below your pay grade?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.843
Uh, yeah, that's how shorthanded we are.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.206
Good, I'll come with you.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.049
I'll wait in the car,
and then we can go for dinner.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.164
I got plans with Donna.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.046
That's even better.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.325
I've been wanting to spend some time with
the woman that won over my father's heart.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.971
Oh, wow.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.524
Oh, I knew we should've had Slade Wilson
do the party planning.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.404
Hey, guys. lam...

07:44.600 --> 07:46.728
You know, I don't know how I'm gonna
get everything done in time.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.285
- Maybe we should cancel.
- What?

07:48.480 --> 07:51.404
I think what Felicity is trying to say
is that we just don't...

07:51.600 --> 07:53.045
We don't want you working too hard.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.850
I don't consider this work.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.963
I think of it as a dry run
for your wedding.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.201
- Mmm-hmm.
- So listen,

07:58.360 --> 08:01.648
we are gonna have
party favors over in that corner,

08:01.840 --> 08:06.004
we're gonna have a champagne tower
right here, mmm-hmm,

08:06.520 --> 08:09.285
and we're gonna play games
over by the fireplace.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.563
Oh, oh, oh, I brought my favorite,
Pin The Junk On The Hunk.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.961
<i>FELICITYI Oh, my God.</i>

08:14.800 --> 08:16.086
Sorry. Is this bad timing?

08:16.280 --> 08:17.441
For who?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.848
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. We got to, uh...

08:20.040 --> 08:22.407
- Yeah.
- Uh, where are you going?

08:22.640 --> 08:24.802
Duty calls. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.242
Is everything okay?

08:27.480 --> 08:31.007
So, Alex got a phone call from one of the
lawyers doing research on the opposition,

08:31.200 --> 08:32.850
and it looks like
they might've found something.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.041
On Ruvé?

08:34.559 --> 08:35.971
On you, actually.

08:36.919 --> 08:41.083
In 2013, Homeland Security
did a tax audit after the Undertaking,

08:41.280 --> 08:45.444
and looks like Mom wrote
a million-dollar check

08:45.640 --> 08:48.883
to some woman named Samantha Clayton.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.811
I mean, Alex flagged it as something
potentially weird for us.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.729
By weird, he means...

08:53.920 --> 08:55.809
Well, the check was never cashed.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.287
So, why would Mom write a check
for a million dollars

08:58.480 --> 08:59.891
to a woman young enough
to be her daughter,

09:00.080 --> 09:02.447
and why would that woman
not cash the check?

09:02.680 --> 09:03.966
I don't know.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.322
Should I look into this Samantha person?

09:06.560 --> 09:07.641
I don't really see the point.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.810
I mean, whatever was going on
with this Samantha person,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.685
clearly, she wanted
nothing to do with Morn.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.723
And either way, I don't... It's just...

09:15.920 --> 09:18.491
I don't see how something like this
would blow back on me.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.321
Thank you.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.806
Okay.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.210
Everything has unfolded
according to providence.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.324
What do you think is under there, anyway?

09:33.520 --> 09:35.045
Power, Mr. Queen.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.641
I'm glad you have recuperated.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.405
We have much to accomplish together.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.887
Reiter's pet.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.450
You don't know what you're talking about.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.880
I know you killed Vlad.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.602
I watched. We all did.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.122
What are you going to do?
Kill him right in front of Reiter's men?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.329
They don't care what we do to him.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.249
They remember what he did to Conklin.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.607
Maybe you men need to go
for a drink or something.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.569
A 602 is breaking and entering.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.730
Why would they need backup
in the form of a police captain?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.843
I told you, we're shorthanded.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.966
Don't worry.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.208
It's not a job for Black Canary.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.521
SCPD! Anyone here?

11:08.640 --> 11:10.881
Yeah, this is Lance. Get me dispatch.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.803
- (Dad!
- {GROANS)

11:16.880 --> 11:18.291
Come on.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.925
Thought I told you to stay in the car.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.042
Yeah, you're welcome.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.763
Go, go, go!

11:33.160 --> 11:35.845
Laurel! Laurel! Go! Go, get out!

11:38.640 --> 11:40.483
Get out! Come on!

11:47.920 --> 11:49.251
Go, go, go!

11:58.440 --> 12:00.044
Are you okay?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.330
What the hell was that?

12:02.520 --> 12:05.649
I don't know. It's like the building
attacked me or something.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.081
But that's not possible.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.327
Is it?

12:14.920 --> 12:18.686
Captain, you move again
and it's gonna leave an even bigger scar.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.126
What happened?

12:20.320 --> 12:21.606
Your guess is as good as mine.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.002
It's like the Big Bad Wolf
huffed or puffed or something.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.201
This wolf being Darhk.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.850
Why do you think they
went through so much trouble

12:27.040 --> 12:28.166
to make it look like an accident?

12:28.360 --> 12:31.170
Maybe they didn't want to take the heat
of killing a police captain.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.885
Thanks for the needlepoint.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.127
Where are you going?

12:34.560 --> 12:36.562
Yeah, if Damien Darhk
has you in his gun sights,

12:36.760 --> 12:38.888
it might not be a good idea
to show yourself in the open.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.366
Uh, I'm meeting with Donna.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.085
Oh, she's fine.
She's probably just playing

12:42.320 --> 12:44.049
Pin The Junk On The Hunk or something.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.964
- What?
- Do not ask. Do not ask.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.964
Stay here for a minute
and let us do what we do.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.361
Look, I'm gonna check with Andy.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.642
See if he's ever seen HIVE
use these tactics before.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.841
<i>Besides, I'm on Daddy duty.</i>

12:53.040 --> 12:54.405
Now that Lyla's the head of A.R.G.U.S.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.365
I'm gonna try and backtrace the call
that supposedly came from dispatch.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.766
I am...

12:59.000 --> 13:01.207
Going to go work on your debate prep?

13:01.800 --> 13:02.881
Yeah.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.486
Debate prep, just took the words
right out of my mouth.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.767
Yep.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.167
This man deserves to die. He tortured us!

13:13.360 --> 13:15.362
And he saved me.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.570
At great risk to himself,
he kept me alive.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.841
I have more reason than anyone
to hate this man.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.011
But he's our best chance of going home.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.241
He killed your brother.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.568
Yes, he did.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.367
Tell them why.

13:30.040 --> 13:33.886
The guard, Conklin, he put Vlad up to it.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.363
I was defending myself. He attacked me.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.205
Now, I...

13:43.680 --> 13:46.206
I know that you have no reason
to trust me,

13:46.400 --> 13:48.402
but I am not your enemy.

13:49.840 --> 13:53.686
All I want to do is stop Reiter,

13:53.880 --> 13:56.281
and get all of you out of this place.

13:56.880 --> 13:57.881
So prove it.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.081
How?

14:00.560 --> 14:02.005
Kill Conklin.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.170
Aside from my brother,
have you killed before?

14:17.680 --> 14:18.727
Yeah.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.247
There was a man in Hong Kong.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.690
And I did terrible things to him.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.084
And that made me a monster.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.080
And you're afraid killing Conklin
will make you into this monster again?

14:35.120 --> 14:36.451
Good.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.522
It takes a monster to fight monsters.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.327
I like this midday summons.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.003
It's very mysterious.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.481
Very sexy-

14:56.080 --> 14:58.003
Pooh Bear, what happened to you?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.565
It's nothing. Listen...

14:59.760 --> 15:03.685
No, baby, it doesn't look like nothing.
Oh, my gosh. Come sit down.

15:04.040 --> 15:08.443
Aw, my big, tough police-captain baby.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.483
- Can I make it all okay...
- No. No, no. Listen to me.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.245
We can't see each other for a while.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.441
What?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.648
Yeah, it's a thing I got into.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.365
I owe some guys some money.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.206
You gamble? Mr. Straight and Narrow?

15:20.440 --> 15:23.330
Yeah, it helped me cope
after I quit drinking.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.804
And I've pissed off
some pretty tough customers and...

15:27.000 --> 15:32.803
Wait a minute, wait, honey,
please, please, I'm a Vegas girl, okay?

15:33.680 --> 15:34.761
Whomever you owe money to

15:34.960 --> 15:39.249
is gonna have to get up pretty early
in the morning to take me on.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.521
So, don't worry.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.210
Sweetheart, it's a little more
complicated than that.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.051
Just for a few weeks. That's all.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.121
That's it.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.046
You know, how about we make it longer?

15:53.240 --> 15:55.527
- What?
- My ex-husband was a lying son of a bitch.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.605
Only two good things
came out of that marriage,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.689
my daughter and my BS detector,
which is flawless.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.043
And right now, yeah, it's redlining.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.321
Donna, you, don't... Please...

16:04.560 --> 16:07.211
Don't... Oh, my God. Don't "Donna" me.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.844
You know what?
This is actually very simple.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.325
You either respect me enough
to tell me the truth, or you don't.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.810
Clearly, you don't.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.244
Donna, please...

16:23.840 --> 16:25.046
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.890
I'm fine.

16:29.880 --> 16:30.881
What did you do?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.644
Why you think it's me
that did something?

16:32.880 --> 16:34.086
Because you're a man.

16:34.520 --> 16:38.889
I'm trying to put some distance between us
in case Darhk is after me,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.731
because I can't stand the idea
of anything happening to her, Felicity.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.285
Yeah, but she looked pretty upset.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.646
Yeah.

16:47.920 --> 16:48.921
Oliver's not here.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.168
I was looking for you.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.811
I found something.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.248
The 602 didn't come from
SCPD dispatch at all.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.090
Someone just made it look like it did.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.884
That someone being HIVE, you're thinking.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.121
There's an encryption on it

17:03.280 --> 17:06.011
that uses the same cipher of a HIVE
sat phone that Merlyn gave us.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.929
- One more time.
- They lured you to the hotel.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.451
Do we know where the call came from?

17:09.640 --> 17:11.165
Price and 14th.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.930
Bunch of other calls
came from there as well.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.246
<i>I'm guessing
it's their base of operations.</i>

17:14.440 --> 17:16.249
Okay. Contact the team,
and have them meet me there.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.441
Yep.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.080
Split up.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.766
Job seems easy enough.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.964
Don't get cocky.
Darhk won't tolerate another screw-up.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.565
Where's Jack?

17:40.760 --> 17:41.921
<i>"HARDHAT". Patrolling.</i>

17:42.160 --> 17:43.400
Why?

17:49.880 --> 17:50.961
Ahh!

17:59.520 --> 18:01.284
Blow it! Let's move!

18:13.200 --> 18:14.326
Go, go, 90!

18:32.920 --> 18:35.685
They're demoing the factory,
just like they did the hotel.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.729
You guys go get Spartan, okay?
I'm gonna get the laptop.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.285
Speedy“ 'N0.go!

18:41.040 --> 18:42.883
Hey, can you walk?

18:44.720 --> 18:46.404
I don't have much of a choice.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.881
- Where's Speedy?
- Right behind us.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.730
Please tell me that the nails
are the clue,

19:21.920 --> 19:23.206
and not what's on the laptop's hard drive

19:23.400 --> 19:25.721
because there are three nails running
straight through this thing.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.571
Yeah, the bad guys went a little crazy
with that nail gun.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.570
Yeah, according to Andy,
they're called the Demolition Team.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.048
Former GRU, IRA, and Mossad.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.208
They're experts in precision demolition.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.965
Now they work for HIVE.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.083
I got a look at the laptop
before it got shot up,

19:41.320 --> 19:42.970
and there were blueprints on the screen.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.884
So they are gonna take down
another building.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.121
Felicity?

19:46.280 --> 19:48.487
I know. The first time we met,

19:48.680 --> 19:52.002
the first thing you asked me to do
is pull data off a damaged laptop.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.201
It's kind of romantic.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.646
In case the laptop is a dead end,

19:54.880 --> 19:57.724
lam going to work up
a list of potential targets.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.210
Yeah, Andy is supposed to
get some more intel.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.561
I'll see if he's made any progress.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.401
Huh. Mom.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.449
Wonder what took her so long.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.524
What was that about?

20:12.720 --> 20:14.449
Donna called it quits.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.644
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.569
Yeah, yeah, me too.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.651
You're lucky you're with someone
you don't need to keep secrets from.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.722
Are these really necessary?

20:26.920 --> 20:28.922
Can't risk you jeopardizing
your life again.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.400
You're much too important.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.400
You know, you keep saying that to me,
but I have no idea what you mean.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.443
Do you believe in destiny, Mr. Queen?

20:36.640 --> 20:38.165
I prefer the idea of free will.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.170
This map conceals deeper truths.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.931
Secrets I couldn't uncover
without more information,

20:44.120 --> 20:47.124
until you brought these to me.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.641
Except, I didn't bring them to you.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.171
Conklin took them.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.731
Destiny, Mr. Queen.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.726
With the survey maps' details,

20:54.920 --> 20:58.367
I was able to decipher
the inscriptions on this,

20:59.160 --> 21:01.208
which you also provided me.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.049
Are you beginning to see it now,
the pattern?

21:05.280 --> 21:07.203
The trend of providence?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.290
Legend tells of a hidden place,

21:10.520 --> 21:13.683
within which lies
a device of untold power.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.888
The quest to find it requires one
who has been granted passage by the gods.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.363
I believe that person is you.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.522
Hey, you're needed upstairs.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.365
Keep Mr. Queen company till I return.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.291
We still have much to discuss.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.567
All this magic mumbo jumbo.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.050
<i>The way it saved your neck with Reiter,</i>

21:40.200 --> 21:43.044
maybe I ought to start
believing in it, myself.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.050
Ain't easy
when it looks like toilet paper.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.484
Boy, you got some balls.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.249
I'm gonna enjoy watching you die.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.844
I am... I...

22:02.160 --> 22:04.322
Ugh. I didn't want to bother you
when you walked in on us

22:04.560 --> 22:06.449
at Oliver's campaign office, but I'm...

22:06.640 --> 22:07.766
It's okay.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.684
No, honey, no. No, it's not.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.968
- It's actually not okay.
- It's okay.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.921
After your father, after all these years,
I thought I finally found the one man

22:19.640 --> 22:23.087
who wouldn't lie to me, okay?

22:23.320 --> 22:24.924
Maybe he's got a good reason.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.606
Yeah. Right.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.762
Honey, I want you to know
that I'm really sorry

22:32.920 --> 22:35.127
that I've been going all Momzilla
for this engagement party...

22:35.320 --> 22:37.004
Momzilla.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.763
Do you want to know why
I pushed the tiaras and...

22:42.040 --> 22:43.690
The ten-tiered cake?

22:43.960 --> 22:46.804
Well, that's because you've loved
princesses since before you could walk.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.610
Yes, that, and, um...

22:53.000 --> 22:55.651
I've been living vicariously
through you.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.291
You and Oliver are one of those couples

23:00.160 --> 23:01.650
that everyone believes in.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.967
You don't lie to each other.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.121
Even

23:07.160 --> 23:09.561
And he's gonna be the best daddy
in the whole world

23:09.800 --> 23:11.962
- when that time comes.
- Ah.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.571
You know that, don't you?

23:14.800 --> 23:16.086
In my bones.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.086
And when I see something that beautiful

23:21.080 --> 23:23.890
and that rare and that romantic,

23:24.080 --> 23:26.481
it also reminds me that,

23:26.680 --> 23:30.207
you know, I'm never gonna
find a love like that.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.561
Yes, you will.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.770
You have it now with Captain Lance.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.531
No, honey, no.
Not if he's hiding something from me.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.643
Maybe he's doing it to protect you.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.728
Because he loves you.

23:42.920 --> 23:47.164
And you need to return that love
with a little bit of trust.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.571
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.210
Crime, health care, taxes,
business incentives,

23:56.400 --> 23:58.880
you've actually
pretty much nailed them all.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.646
Stop sounding so surprised, please.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.002
Well, I mean, you did spend
your education nailing chicks,

24:04.200 --> 24:06.885
not doing social studies.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.646
Okay. I'm sort of wiped.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.281
- Can we wrap this up, maybe?
- Um...

24:12.720 --> 24:16.008
Yeah, I did just have
one more question for you.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.201
Okay.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.330
Why didn't you tell me you went to college
with Samantha Clayton?

24:24.040 --> 24:26.441
I was with Samantha Clayton

24:27.880 --> 24:29.370
while I was dating Laurel.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.681
And I'm not proud of that, so...

24:32.880 --> 24:36.123
So why did Mom pay her a million dollars?

24:36.320 --> 24:38.084
Thea, I told you, Mom is...

24:38.280 --> 24:40.487
Ollie, I, um... I looked her up.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.644
Right after you guys broke up,
she moved to Central City.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.844
She's got a son

24:48.560 --> 24:49.607
named William.

24:51.560 --> 24:54.882
- Who's about as old as that check is...
- Okay, Thea.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.208
When we were in Central City,

24:57.400 --> 25:02.327
I knew something was bothering you,
and I knew it just wasn't Vandal Savage.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.849
I mean, now it makes sense.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.204
William's your son, isn't he?

25:08.480 --> 25:09.561
Yes, he is.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.728
Why haven't you told anyone?

25:11.920 --> 25:15.845
Because Samantha said that
the only way that I could see him

25:16.040 --> 25:20.409
is if I promised to not tell him,
or anyone else, that I'm his father.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.204
God, that's...

25:23.600 --> 25:25.523
That is brutal. Are you okay?

25:25.720 --> 25:27.563
I thought I was doing okay.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.491
I spent a lot of time
convincing myself that I was...

25:30.680 --> 25:34.082
That I was trying to do
the right thing, but then,

25:34.280 --> 25:38.251
you know, you brought this,
the thing with the check, and I'm not...

25:38.440 --> 25:40.363
It's not your fault, but it's...

25:40.600 --> 25:43.046
You bring it up right when we're trying
to plan an engagement party.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.608
So, I'm left to think,
"How can I marry Felicity"

25:46.800 --> 25:49.041
"if there is this lie between us?"

25:49.240 --> 25:50.844
It's not a lie.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.965
Okay? It's a promise that you are keeping
to the mother of your child...

25:55.160 --> 25:56.889
Doesn't make it right, Thea.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.889
Look at it from Samantha's perspective.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.366
As far as she knows,

26:00.560 --> 26:02.847
- you are a rich playboy...
- Right.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.004
Who slept with a bunch of women,
and got her pregnant.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.964
I'm not that person anymore.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.286
Now you're the Green Arrow.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.643
Anyone who comes into your life
is automatically a target.

26:13.360 --> 26:17.126
What Samantha is asking for you to do...

26:17.320 --> 26:20.369
As hard as it may be,
it is the right thing to do.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.164
I know you want to tell Felicity...

26:24.840 --> 26:27.969
And trust me, I would love to be an aunt.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.961
But you have got to do the right thing
for your son here.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.844
As hard as this may be for you, Ollie,

26:38.600 --> 26:41.524
keeping William a secret
is keeping him safe.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.486
Yes, John.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.648
Andy did a little digging on the dark web.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.167
Found out the Demolition Team
uses a specialized acid

26:57.360 --> 26:59.124
that can weaken building structures.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.322
Only one warehouse in the city stocks it.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.648
- Text me the address, I'll be right there.
- I'm coming with you.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.844
No, no, no. Just...
It's a long shot, at best.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.771
- Thea.
- Yeah?

27:13.400 --> 27:15.368
- Thank you.
- For what?

27:15.560 --> 27:17.722
Just saying what I needed to hear.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.724
I'll clear the area.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.445
Too late. They cleaned this place out.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.483
Yeah, took 100 gallons
of that acid with them.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.205
Whatever they plan on taking down...

27:36.400 --> 27:37.561
ls massive.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.091
Hey! Uh, hope I'm not bothering you. I...

27:52.760 --> 27:54.649
Uh, Curtis, why is my face
your screen saver?

27:54.840 --> 27:58.367
At the risk of early termination,
uh, none of your business.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.971
- Curtis!
- Please don't ask.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.889
I'm, like, super bad with secrets.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.969
Okay. It's an early wedding gift,

28:04.200 --> 28:06.680
but it's really bad luck if you see it,
so, please stop trying to see it.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.723
Okay, I think you're getting
your wedding traditions confused,

28:08.920 --> 28:09.921
but fine, I will let it go.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.606
Lucky for you,
I have more important concerns.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.246
I maxed out the computer power
in the lair, again,

28:15.440 --> 28:17.408
and I was hoping maybe your mainframe
might have better luck.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.645
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.563
Really, me on a screen saver, hmm?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.882
Whatever the surprise is,
it better be good.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.411
Oh, it will be.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.251
Well, that's not
your typical nighttime suit.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.209
You're the reason I'm wearing it.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.929
Inspiring me to save this city
in the light of day.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.521
Fine inspiration I turned out to be,
hiding down here in the dark.

28:39.720 --> 28:40.721
For your protection.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.811
You haven't told Donna, have you?

28:45.480 --> 28:46.481
No.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.406
How you kept this up
for four years, huh?

28:50.600 --> 28:53.206
This double life,
these secrets, lying, I mean...

28:53.400 --> 28:55.482
I'm trying not to live that way anymore.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.641
Trying.

28:58.840 --> 28:59.841
<i>You know in AA,</i>

29:00.040 --> 29:02.611
we say you're only as sick
as the secrets you keep.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.005
You're looking pretty healthy these days.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.241
And I just hope I can get back
to that place with Donna.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.851
For what it's worth,
you're in a tough spot,

29:10.040 --> 29:11.530
and you're trying to keep her safe.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.090
You know, sometimes, a lie isn't wrong

29:14.280 --> 29:16.681
when it's for the good
of someone that you love.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.122
Just so you know, after I'm done with you,

29:22.360 --> 29:24.169
I'ma gut that slave girl, just for kicks.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.890
All the rest of 'em, too.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.481
You're never hurting them ever again.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.531
There he is. There's the killer.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.402
You stupid son of a bitch.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.646
Reiter's gonna kill everyone
no matter what you do.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.800
So, Ruvé's probably gonna question you
on your party-boy past,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.081
but if she does we just gotta...

30:05.320 --> 30:07.527
If she does, just steer the conversation
back towards the issues.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.721
- I've got it.
- Yep.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.969
Alex's mom kind of picked the wrong week
to go in for surgery, don't you think?

30:12.200 --> 30:13.486
I couldn't agree more.

30:14.160 --> 30:18.165
We got about 20 minutes until we're live,
so, how're you feeling?

30:18.360 --> 30:20.966
Are you nervous at all or...

30:21.160 --> 30:24.084
You know, I don't think that "nervous"
is in Oliver's vocabulary.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.601
Yes, but "translucent matte powder"
should be.

30:26.840 --> 30:30.811
You don't want to shine under
those big bright lights.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.481
Hey, why do we... No.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.609
Why do we even need makeup?
We're not even gonna be onstage.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.484
Reaction shots, sweetie.
Plus, I just... I love makeup.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.364
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- What?

30:38.600 --> 30:39.931
- I gotta take this.
- Oh, okay.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.451
You know what? I'm gonna be right back.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.927
I hate this. It's a horrible powder puff.
It's just... It's awful.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.121
That was fast.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.370
You sound surprised. I don't know
whether to be flattered or insulted.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.881
<i>- Okay, Curtis. What did you get?
- Not</i> much. <i>Just</i> a <i>set of blueprints.</i>

30:51.080 --> 30:54.323
Pretty underwhelming, considering.
I'm uploading it to you now.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.370
Curtis, I gotta call you back.
Oliver, I need you.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.801
What's wrong?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.129
I know what building
HIVE is planning on taking down.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.560
It's this one.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.366
<i>Okay,
I have a million questions.</i>

31:11.560 --> 31:13.324
But first, why would HIVE
try to attack the debate?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.284
To take me out and discourage
anyone else from running.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.289
Okay. But Darhk's wife is here
at ground zero.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.726
So it doesn't really make sense to...

31:18.920 --> 31:22.481
Unless Darhk's demolition team is
gonna wipe everyone out except for Ruvé.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.364
Leaving Mrs. Darhk a sympathetic survivor

31:24.560 --> 31:26.688
instead of the pot of evil stew
that she actually is.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.087
Can you identify the likely areas
the bombs would be in?

31:29.320 --> 31:30.481
Yeah, according to the schematics,

31:30.680 --> 31:32.091
it's these three points.
But this building, it's huge.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.321
We need to split up and cover more ground.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.851
Okay, good thing
we brought a change of clothes.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.161
Call Laurel and Diggle.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.601
Can you hack the fire alarm?
We need to evacuate the building.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.006
It's an old system.
It might take me a minute.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.284
Yeah, I learned that in high school.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.041
So, we could...

31:52.480 --> 31:54.482
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

31:55.160 --> 31:56.764
<i>Change of plans.</i>

31:57.200 --> 32:00.170
<i>Do not let Oliver Queen
leave this building alive.</i>

32:01.040 --> 32:02.371
Copy that.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.044
Hey, I finally found it.
Where's Oliver and Thea?

32:14.280 --> 32:16.362
Oh, they're probably just inside
making sure everyone gets out okay.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.484
You left them inside? Honey, come on,
we need to go help them. Let's go.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.170
- Excuse me. Outta the way.
- Excuse us.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.522
Captain Lance,
you're supposed to be... Not here.

32:23.720 --> 32:27.008
What kind of cop sits on the sidelines
when people's lives are at risk?

32:28.040 --> 32:29.280
You stay here.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.407
<i>I count three charges, but no Demo Team.</i>

32:48.600 --> 32:49.647
<i>What do you see?</i>

32:49.840 --> 32:51.729
Same here. No hostiles.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.922
<i>"SPEEDY". Lots of ticky-tocky bombs.</i>

33:00.040 --> 33:01.246
More charges down here.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.930
I see the countdown.
13:25 until detonation.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.167
That's two minutes
after the debate starts.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.725
<i>We need to disarm these things.</i>

33:08.960 --> 33:10.086
Disarming one now.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.521
I hope this neutralizing agent works.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.081
Ahh!

33:16.480 --> 33:17.925
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.724
The place is booby-trapped.
Be careful up there.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.969
Or don't. It's not polite to touch things
that ain't yours.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.322
Yeah, you're not the only one with tricks.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.607
Watch out!

33:44.240 --> 33:45.287
Speedy!

35:03.400 --> 35:04.401
We're clear.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.331
It's clear down here, too.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.560
Top is clear. Thanks.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.321
Sure you should be out in the open?

35:19.520 --> 35:21.090
Don't you have somewhere to be
right about now?

35:28.360 --> 35:31.728
I checked the cafeteria,
the green room, everywhere.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.400
Everywhere except
for the bathroom, apparently.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.921
Sorry. Nervous bladder, I think.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.566
Oh, that was something
I never needed to hear, ever.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.764
- Um, are you ready to go?
- More than.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.131
<i>All right, come on, buddy.
Come on.</i>

35:49.600 --> 35:51.443
Captain Lance never lets his man get away.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.209
You shouldn't either.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.961
Nice applause.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.730
It's enough to bring the house down.

36:08.960 --> 36:09.961
Almost.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.246
Good luck.

36:23.400 --> 36:27.325
<i>Despite a bomb threat, tonight's
mayoral debate then went on as scheduled</i>

36:27.640 --> 36:31.281
<i>with Mr. Queen being declared,
by most pundits, the clear winner.</i>

36:31.480 --> 36:34.609
Oh! Of course he's the clear winner.
He's marrying my daughter.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.325
Well, I think you're a little biased.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.443
Did Alex call with the new poll numbers?

36:38.640 --> 36:40.369
Well, if Bethany Snow is right,
he doesn't have to.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.608
Experts are saying that you already won.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.365
- Experts aren't the voters.
- Okay.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.528
Well, you at least have one voter
in your camp.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.128
- Me!
- Only one that matters.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.321
Mmm.

36:52.840 --> 36:56.162
Conklin may have had his difficulties,
but he was a good man.

36:56.400 --> 37:00.086
Yeah. He was a good man who attacked me.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.607
- Self-defense.
- As it was with her brother?

37:05.160 --> 37:06.525
I'm not saying it lacks irony.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.247
I need you alive, Mr. Queen.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.362
But there are different forms of alive.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.766
Don't test me again.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.001
You did it.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.442
- What was that for?
- Thank you.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.170
I don't need thanks, Taiana.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.410
Before he died, Conklin told me

37:37.600 --> 37:40.649
that Reiter was gonna kill everybody here.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.050
We don't have much time.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.281
Thank you.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.046
Uh, John, can I introduce you
to Laura Hoffman?

37:53.600 --> 37:56.729
- Laura.
- Oh, don't mind if I do. John, hi.

37:56.960 --> 38:01.010
Laura was our neighbor in Ivy Town.
She drove all day to get here.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.850
Please. The drive was nothing.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.123
I've been waiting five months
for this moment to finally arrive.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.051
Oh, hey, have you started
your wedding registry yet?

38:09.240 --> 38:12.084
Because I may very well have
the perfect gift idea for you.

38:12.280 --> 38:14.408
Oh, let me guess. Slow cooker?

38:14.640 --> 38:15.721
HOW did she...

38:15.920 --> 38:17.490
- How did you know that?
- I'm telepathic.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.445
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt,
but I need you both.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.051
Photographer is here.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.928
- Did you invite him?
- Who? Me? Uh...

38:29.440 --> 38:32.444
- Sorry, could I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes, absolutely.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.641
- Felicity...
- What?

38:33.840 --> 38:35.251
The photographer's right over there.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.681
We will make it there just fine
by ourselves.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.203
- Captain.
- Nice to see you.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.643
Please.

38:42.880 --> 38:46.168
Thanks. It's quite the party
you've got going on here.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.563
What? What?
What do you want to talk about?

38:50.800 --> 38:54.566
Well, I came here to apologize
because you were right. l...

38:55.760 --> 38:56.807
I lied to you.

38:57.840 --> 39:01.686
Because I was afraid
of how you would react to the truth.

39:03.160 --> 39:05.049
That thing that I was worried about?

39:07.280 --> 39:10.090
- It wasn't a gambling problem.
- It was HIVE.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.760
The same people that...

39:12.960 --> 39:14.689
- The same people that hurt my baby?
- Mmm.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.645
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

39:16.840 --> 39:18.524
'Cause I'm not in their gun sights
'cause I'm police.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.688
I'm in their gun sights
'cause I stopped working for them.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.845
You were working with Damien Darhk?

39:24.040 --> 39:25.644
He threatened Laurel.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.489
And the truth is,

39:28.720 --> 39:31.690
I'm glad Darhk came after me and not her,
because if he'd done that, I...

39:31.880 --> 39:33.041
You were protecting her.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.449
Just like you were protecting me.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.521
Well, I'll be...

39:39.720 --> 39:40.926
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.731
Ah...

39:45.000 --> 39:46.809
Is it possible to go blind
from too many flashes?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.002
Take a little bit of a break.
Just for a moment.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.366
I literally can't see a thing right now.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.562
I think the cure for that is champagne.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.764
Ah! Dr. Queen, I do believe you are right.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.571
Curtis! Paul!

39:59.120 --> 40:00.849
<i>So glad you guys made it.</i>

40:01.080 --> 40:03.208
Quick. Grab a glass of this champagne.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.528
Careful, he might drink the entire bottle.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.609
- I like my bubbly, what can I say?
- Mmm-hmm.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.121
Uh-uh-uh.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.125
Mixing a downer with all the coffee
you've had in the last <i>72</i> hours?

40:12.320 --> 40:13.367
Your head might explode.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.722
Yeah, I have been pulling
a lot of crazy hours.

40:16.120 --> 40:20.762
After my surprise was blown on my gift,
I wanted to finish it as soon as possible.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.244
Thanks. We forgot to register
for microchips.

40:32.440 --> 40:37.844
Actually, it's neither micro nor chip.
It's an implantable bio-stimulant.

40:38.080 --> 40:41.766
And why would I need
an implantable bio-stimulant?

40:43.040 --> 40:44.963
For walking.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.321
Curtis...

40:49.200 --> 40:52.966
In the perfect world, it'll work in time
for you to walk down the aisle.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.846
I mean, but it's pretty cutting-edge,
and so I can't promise anything.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.089
You're telling me that this little piece
of technology is gonna help me walk again?

41:00.280 --> 41:02.123
After it's implanted in your spine, yes.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.369
<i>He's been trying
to crack it for a while,</i>

41:04.600 --> 41:07.729
but he needed a power source,
something that would last a lifetime.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.763
- Palmer Technologies' power cell.
- Exactly.

41:09.960 --> 41:12.804
Once I solved that,
I knew this might actually work.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.411
Oh, my God.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.525
I don't know what to say.

41:19.160 --> 41:20.321
I do.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.526
Curtis, you're terrific. Thank you.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.644
No. Well, don't thank me yet.
It still has to work.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.611
It'll work. I know it will.
You, come with me.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.844
We're about to make my mother very happy.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.802
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.843
Nora, honey,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.041
Nora, this is William.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.969
William's mother asked us
to look after him.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.049
He'll be staying with us for a while.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.321
Nice to meet you, William.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.363
- You want to play?
- Sure.

42:28.720 --> 42:29.721
English - SDH
