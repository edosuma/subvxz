00:20.504 --> 00:21.720
<i> (Teddy groans)</i>

00:21.947 --> 00:24.097
Everything okay, Teddy?
You keep looking at that letter

00:24.174 --> 00:25.507
and making that noise.

00:25.601 --> 00:27.417
Mm. It's an invitation
from the navy.

00:27.436 --> 00:29.361
What, the navy
doesn't have Evite?

00:29.588 --> 00:31.196
Are you shipping out, sailor?

00:31.348 --> 00:33.257
Are we talking new navy
or old navy?

00:33.350 --> 00:35.868
Uh, the frigate I served on
is getting decommissioned.

00:35.944 --> 00:37.202
They're gonna scuttle
the old girl.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.686
Buy her dinner first, right?

00:38.706 --> 00:41.948
I think I understood
three of those words, Teddy.

00:42.101 --> 00:43.433
Oh, sorry. A frigate's a ship,

00:43.452 --> 00:45.619
and scuttling
is sinking it on purpose.

00:45.695 --> 00:47.287
Wait, why are they
sinking it on purpose?

00:47.439 --> 00:48.955
Is it because
if they can't have it,

00:49.124 --> 00:50.198
-no one else can?
-Kind of.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.383
It's getting decommissioned.

00:51.493 --> 00:53.460
Once a navy ship
gets too old to be useful,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.220
a lot of times,
they'll torpedo it.

00:55.297 --> 00:56.722
And then it sinks
to the bottom of the ocean

00:56.873 --> 00:59.707
and becomes an artificial reef
for fish and sea monsters,

00:59.727 --> 01:01.134
-I assume.
-Frigate.

01:01.287 --> 01:03.044
-Gene, don't say "frigate."
-It's not a bad word.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.380
I want to hear more
about the torpedoing part.

01:05.549 --> 01:07.715
Where are they doing it?
When are they doing it?

01:07.735 --> 01:09.050
Can we buy tickets to watch?

01:09.128 --> 01:10.569
And can I be the one
to push the button?

01:10.796 --> 01:12.145
And if I'm the one
pushing the button,

01:12.239 --> 01:13.555
do I really need to buy
a ticket?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.649
Yeah, it's happening next week
out at sea.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.076
No one's invited to that.

01:17.227 --> 01:19.319
But, uh, those of us
who served on the maiden voyage

01:19.413 --> 01:20.971
are invited
to a ceremony tomorrow.

01:21.064 --> 01:22.397
It's in Bog Harbor

01:22.416 --> 01:23.582
because they built
part of the ship there.

01:23.733 --> 01:24.808
The toilets, I think.

01:24.827 --> 01:26.568
That's fun. That's exciting.

01:26.645 --> 01:28.587
So why are you being all mopey
about it?

01:28.814 --> 01:30.330
Well, I'm probably not gonna go.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.166
What? You have to go.
It's a ceremony.

01:33.319 --> 01:34.576
Ah, I don't know.
I'm just not sure

01:34.595 --> 01:36.762
I want to run into
any of my old shipmates.

01:36.989 --> 01:38.505
Why not?
Don't you want to reminisce

01:38.599 --> 01:39.598
about the good ol' days?

01:39.825 --> 01:41.082
Put on your little sailor suits

01:41.176 --> 01:42.434
and dance around the town?

01:42.544 --> 01:44.828
-Aw.
-I mean,
I loved being in the navy,

01:44.921 --> 01:47.164
but, uh, it wasn't all great.

01:47.182 --> 01:48.923
There was this one incident.

01:49.017 --> 01:50.167
Wha...? What happened?

01:50.185 --> 01:52.260
Just a silly little mistake.

01:52.429 --> 01:55.005
Did you launch the nukes
accidentally on purpose,

01:55.023 --> 01:56.115
-wink-wink?
-No.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.432
Did you fall in love
with a mermaid,

01:57.451 --> 01:59.100
and then she became human
for you,

01:59.194 --> 02:00.861
then she missed the ocean,
and she returned to the sea,

02:01.013 --> 02:03.104
-and you never got over it?
-No, not that.

02:03.273 --> 02:04.439
Teddy, just tell us the story!

02:04.533 --> 02:07.534
-Sorry. Sorry.
-(groans) All right, fine.

02:07.611 --> 02:08.961
<i> We were in the middle</i>
<i> of a deployment</i>

02:09.188 --> 02:10.370
<i> in the middle of the Pacific,</i>

02:10.464 --> 02:11.964
<i> and it was the middle</i>
<i> of the night.</i>

02:12.115 --> 02:13.632
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Lot of middles, Malcolm.</i>

02:13.859 --> 02:15.692
<i> TEDDY:</i>
<i> I was scrubbing the deck</i>
<i> when an officer came by.</i>

02:15.785 --> 02:18.470
<i> You always have to salute</i>
<i> an officer, so I did.</i>

02:18.622 --> 02:20.622
-But he was a ghost.
-No, he was really there.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.807
But what wasn't there

02:22.050 --> 02:25.460
<i>was a railing, so I kind of fell</i>
<i> into the ocean.</i>

02:25.479 --> 02:26.812
(screams)

02:26.963 --> 02:29.539
Which happens sometimes
but almost never.

02:29.633 --> 02:32.542
They rang the bell and stopped
the ship and fished me out.

02:32.711 --> 02:35.470
And everyone woke up and saw it.
It was not great.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.381
So, hey,
you fell off your ship one time

02:37.399 --> 02:39.065
and had to get rescued.
Big deal.

02:39.218 --> 02:40.659
-Two times.
-Two times?

02:40.810 --> 02:44.221
Yeah. I-I fell off a second
time, on the same night.

02:44.314 --> 02:46.665
<i> Yeah, I was showing some guys</i>
<i> how easy it is to fall in.</i>

02:46.816 --> 02:48.408
<i> And then I fell in again.</i>

02:48.560 --> 02:49.559
(screams)

02:49.653 --> 02:50.652
Oh, Teddy.

02:50.729 --> 02:52.337
I mean, that's not that bad.

02:52.489 --> 02:54.339
It was bad. I got a nickname.

02:54.491 --> 02:56.400
-Captain Drippy?
-Admiral Belly Flop?

02:56.493 --> 02:58.568
-Double-Dip.
-Double-Dip? Oh, that's good.

02:58.587 --> 03:00.679
-Sorry.
-For the rest of the deployment,

03:00.906 --> 03:01.922
everyone called me Double-Dip.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.757
Then that's all I was
to everybody.

03:03.909 --> 03:05.166
So that's why I don't want to go

03:05.260 --> 03:07.168
to the farewell ceremony
tomorrow.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.520
No, you got to go.

03:08.672 --> 03:10.522
Lin, it doesn't sound
like Teddy wants to go.

03:10.749 --> 03:11.915
He<i> needs</i> to go.

03:11.934 --> 03:14.084
-I do?
-Yes. Otherwise, they win.

03:14.177 --> 03:15.252
-They do?
-Yeah.

03:15.421 --> 03:16.770
But if you go, you win.

03:16.922 --> 03:19.180
You'll show them you don't care
about some dumb nickname.

03:19.349 --> 03:20.741
But I kind of<i> do</i> care about it.

03:20.850 --> 03:22.609
It comes up quite a bit
in therapy.

03:22.761 --> 03:24.444
That and my thing
about shopping carts.

03:24.596 --> 03:26.538
Look,
something similar happened to me

03:26.690 --> 03:27.706
when I was in high school.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.433
You fell off
a high school frigate?

03:29.451 --> 03:31.859
No. I was over
at Debbie Bernardini's house

03:31.879 --> 03:33.770
for a sleepover
with a group of girls

03:33.863 --> 03:35.455
who I thought were my friends.

03:35.607 --> 03:38.050
<i> We were watching a scary movie</i>
<i> that was very popular</i>

03:38.201 --> 03:39.367
<i> at the time.</i>
<i> I forget what it was called.</i>

03:39.386 --> 03:41.553
<i> There was a guy,</i>
<i> he was killing people.</i>

03:41.780 --> 03:43.129
<i> -You know the one. Anyway,</i>
<i> -(gasps)</i>

03:43.206 --> 03:44.723
<i> so, someone got killed,</i>
<i> and we all screamed,</i>

03:44.950 --> 03:46.541
<i> -and I farted.</i>
-(farts)

03:46.560 --> 03:47.951
<i> But it turns out</i>
<i> it was more than just a fart.</i>

03:47.970 --> 03:49.636
<i> A little bit of poop</i>
<i> came out, too.</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:51.212
<i> It was pretty obvious</i>
<i> when the smell didn't go away.</i>

03:51.232 --> 03:53.139
<i> And I also went</i>
<i> into the bathroom,</i>

03:53.234 --> 03:54.900
<i> and I might have</i>
<i> kind of shouted,</i>

03:55.051 --> 03:56.977
<i> "Oh, no,</i>
<i> a little bit of poop came out!</i>

03:57.129 --> 03:58.553
<i> There's poop! There's poop!"</i>

03:58.572 --> 03:59.887
<i> And they called me</i>
<i> Death by Chocolate.</i>

03:59.907 --> 04:01.055
<i> And they laughed a lot.</i>

04:01.149 --> 04:02.724
<i> And I didn't go</i>

04:02.818 --> 04:04.243
to another sleepover
for the rest of high school.

04:04.394 --> 04:05.727
You are pretty vocal
in the bathroom

04:05.821 --> 04:08.396
-about what's going on.
-Yeah, a lot of commentary.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.082
She's like Ken Burns in there.

04:10.309 --> 04:13.310
It helps to talk it through.
Anyway, I let them win.

04:13.328 --> 04:16.255
Teddy, that's why you got to go
to your thing, so you win.

04:16.406 --> 04:17.905
That's a touching story, Linda,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.741
but I don't know
if I can face those guys.

04:19.835 --> 04:21.334
-We'll come with you.
-Really?

04:21.487 --> 04:22.319
No. No, no, no.

04:22.337 --> 04:23.670
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

04:23.822 --> 04:25.264
As emotional support.
And muscle if you need it.

04:25.491 --> 04:28.267
But not going
is also a reasonable option.

04:28.494 --> 04:30.160
I mean,
if you guys came with me,

04:30.178 --> 04:31.586
I'd feel a lot better
about going.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.680
And they're gonna have
a bunch of music and food.

04:33.832 --> 04:35.107
It says
"Bring the whole family."

04:35.258 --> 04:36.683
It doesn't say whose family.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.610
-Please?
-Please, please, please?
I want to get a picture

04:38.762 --> 04:41.113
-of me with a torpedo for my own
personal Christmas card.
-Yeah, Dad.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.949
I hear you're supposed to do
fun activities with your kids.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.859
-Come on, Bob.
-(groans)

04:45.953 --> 04:47.177
O-Okay, fine.

04:47.346 --> 04:48.287
-Frigate.
-Gene.

04:48.514 --> 04:50.438
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> Do we look okay, Teddy?</i>

04:50.457 --> 04:52.774
-Are we under-tattooed?
-Should we go on shore leave

04:52.793 --> 04:54.275
and cause a ruckus
with some locals?

04:54.295 --> 04:56.353
-Come back with a shiner?
-And cans of spinach

04:56.355 --> 04:58.204
that you somehow suck
through the can?

04:58.357 --> 04:59.631
Oh, boy, here we go.

04:59.858 --> 05:02.116
Sheesh, I can't believe
it's been 30 years.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.135
You and the ship look amazing.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.694
One of you has barnacles
on them,

05:04.713 --> 05:06.546
but I'm not gonna say who
'cause I'm a gentleman sailor.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.715
Come on, let's go touch stuff
we're not supposed to.

05:08.867 --> 05:11.292
Uh, okay, but don't do that.

05:11.495 --> 05:13.961
Uh, I'm so nervous.
My ears are sweating.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.221
No, they're no...
Oh, my God, they are.

05:15.432 --> 05:16.873
I thought it was an earring.

05:16.966 --> 05:19.042
Remember, just by showing up
today, you win, and they lose.

05:19.135 --> 05:20.152
TONY (chuckles):
Hey.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.486
Check it out. It's Double-Dip.

05:21.563 --> 05:23.396
(chuckles):
Double-Dip is here. No way.

05:23.549 --> 05:26.550
How'd you get here?
Did you swim over? (laughs)

05:26.568 --> 05:28.660
-Oh, boy.
-Okay, they win, I lose.
Let's go.

05:28.812 --> 05:30.829
Come on, Teddy.
Just stay for a little bit.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.722
An hour tops. Six drinks.

05:32.741 --> 05:34.482
Just kidding. Sort of.
There's drinks, right?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.651
-Yeah.
-Good. Hey, you can do this.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.578
We'll be here for you.
Right next to you.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.038
-Right, Bob?
-Uh, sure.

05:40.190 --> 05:41.340
Or-or behind you.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.900
It just kind of depends
on how everyone's standing.

05:43.919 --> 05:45.010
Okay, fine. An hour.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.845
And maybe you guys hold my hands
the whole time?

05:47.072 --> 05:49.406
-No? Probably not?
-RAUL: Get over here.

05:49.499 --> 05:51.833
-And try not to fall in.
-(all laugh)

05:51.927 --> 05:53.259
I don't like it.
I don't like it.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.519
-I don't like it.
-It's gonna be great.

05:54.746 --> 05:56.438
-Come on, let's do this ship.
-(Teddy groans)

06:00.602 --> 06:03.587
Hey, Tony, Raul, Billy.
Good to see you all.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.513
Double-Dip, you came. Wow.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.515
Of course he came.
He's a navy man

06:07.534 --> 06:10.202
showing off his old ship
to his not-navy friends.

06:10.395 --> 06:12.112
We're his biggest fans.
We're like his groupies.

06:12.264 --> 06:13.597
-Right, Bob?
-BOB: Mm.

06:13.615 --> 06:15.356
It's great to see you, DD.
That's short for Double-D,

06:15.376 --> 06:16.766
which is short for Double-Dip.

06:16.935 --> 06:18.435
'Cause he fell
in the ocean twice.

06:18.453 --> 06:22.047
(laughs) Yeah, I forgot
all about that Double-Dip stuff.

06:22.198 --> 06:23.790
So glad you brought it up.

06:23.942 --> 06:26.126
I got to go over there now
and see what that stuff is

06:26.220 --> 06:28.128
over on that thing. The table?

06:28.222 --> 06:29.704
What is it, food?
(laughs)

06:29.723 --> 06:31.948
-Okay, see you later.
-Okay.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.801
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Has it been an hour yet?

06:34.878 --> 06:36.210
I think it's been,
like, ten minutes?

06:36.230 --> 06:38.563
If we round up from one minute.

06:38.715 --> 06:40.381
Come on, you're doing great.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.733
You're sticking it
to those navy ninnies.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.735
Do you know how much I wish
I could go to a boat party

06:43.962 --> 06:45.629
with the Debbie Bernardini crew
right now and say,

06:45.647 --> 06:47.889
"Look at me.
No chocolate on this dress"?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.984
God, I'd kill for that.
Oh, actually, that is chocolate.

06:51.136 --> 06:52.077
Where'd you get chocolate?

06:52.228 --> 06:53.319
-I don't know.
-LOUISE: Well,

06:53.472 --> 06:55.080
terrible news.
Turns out all the weapons

06:55.231 --> 06:56.640
were taken off this ship
weeks ago.

06:56.733 --> 06:59.325
Apparently, it's "not safe"
to scuttle a ship

06:59.478 --> 07:02.087
with missiles on board.
This is why I don't pay taxes.

07:02.164 --> 07:05.315
We did see a knot-tying workshop
for the sailors' kids. Eh?

07:05.408 --> 07:07.241
I mean, why "knot"?
(chuckles)

07:07.335 --> 07:09.410
I could finally learn
how to tie these bad boys.

07:09.504 --> 07:10.820
Mom tied them a year ago,

07:10.822 --> 07:12.747
and now I just try not to have
to take them off.

07:12.841 --> 07:14.749
Pass. I know
all the knots I need to know

07:14.768 --> 07:16.250
from Tina's
Thundergirl handbook.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.085
Oh, yeah.
I was supposed to learn those,

07:18.105 --> 07:19.512
but I did "knot."

07:19.665 --> 07:21.589
Seriously, though,
I didn't get my knot-tying badge

07:21.667 --> 07:23.366
because I made
too many knot jokes.

07:23.426 --> 07:25.018
-I'm funny at Thundergirls.
-BOB: I-I would do knots.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.520
I-I've always wanted
to be a knots guy.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.115
I mean, it's for kids,
but I'm sure it isn't weird

07:30.342 --> 07:31.283
if a grown man is also learning.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.285
You can pretend to be our dad.

07:33.436 --> 07:35.512
All right,
everyone got their rope?

07:35.605 --> 07:37.013
If that's what this is.

07:37.032 --> 07:38.272
Schmitty, is that you?

07:38.292 --> 07:41.126
Oh. No, I'm-I'm not, uh,
Schmitty.

07:41.277 --> 07:42.869
-I-I'm-I'm Bob.
-Wow.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.278
You are the spitting image.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.705
Raul, look at this guy
over here.

07:45.857 --> 07:47.114
Doesn't he look like Schmitty?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.967
Huh. Now that you mention it,

07:49.118 --> 07:50.210
yeah, he's the spitting image.

07:50.362 --> 07:51.878
TINA: Huh, he does look
like Schmitty.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.380
-Wait, who's Schmitty?
-I mean, I knew
he wasn't coming today.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.549
He's in Florida doing
that deep-sea salvage stuff.

07:56.702 --> 08:00.127
Sunken treasure.
That's the life, huh? Schmitty.

08:00.296 --> 08:02.981
-"Sunken treasure"
is what I call Dad's butt.
-Gene.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.799
All right, we're gonna start off

08:04.818 --> 08:06.485
with a simple
but important knot:

08:06.712 --> 08:07.635
the bowline.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.729
Make a loop.
Tag end goes through.

08:09.881 --> 08:11.881
Under and over. Back through.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.659
Bowline.
Let's see how you all did.

08:14.886 --> 08:16.219
Good. Nice. Eh,

08:16.312 --> 08:17.478
boy, you really aren't Schmitty.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.313
Sorry, can-can you show me
one more time?

08:19.333 --> 08:22.316
-You-you went really fast.
-"Knot" too fast for me.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.002
Actually, it was a little fast.

08:24.153 --> 08:25.987
Okay. Make a loop,
pass it through,

08:26.006 --> 08:29.065
under and over
and back through and...

08:29.084 --> 08:31.343
-Still too fast?
-Still too fast.
-I'm good.

08:31.494 --> 08:34.254
Okay. Here's how we teach
the little kids.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.906
The rabbit comes up
from his hole,

08:37.000 --> 08:38.241
runs around the tree

08:38.260 --> 08:40.076
and then goes back
into his hole.

08:40.095 --> 08:42.912
Your rabbit didn't make it back
into its hole.

08:43.006 --> 08:45.357
-Wait, where is your rabbit?
-Uh, uh...

08:45.508 --> 08:47.174
Dad, what did you do
to your rabbit?!

08:47.194 --> 08:48.585
Okay, enough food, Teddy.

08:48.678 --> 08:50.695
Let's hit the bar,
get some alcohol inside of you.

08:50.847 --> 08:52.680
Eh, but Tony and the guys
are at the bar.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.199
Teddy, it's a free country.

08:54.350 --> 08:55.608
And free drinks. Come on.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.245
Have you considered
challenging them to a navy duel,

08:58.430 --> 08:59.946
which I assume
involves water guns?

09:00.098 --> 09:01.781
TEDDY:
Let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

09:01.933 --> 09:04.358
(laughs loudly)
Teddy, you're so witty,

09:04.378 --> 09:06.436
and you know so much
about ships and life,

09:06.529 --> 09:08.713
and you just don't care
what people think about you.

09:08.865 --> 09:11.624
(laughs)
Oh, you guys again. Hi.

09:11.777 --> 09:13.626
Hey, I just came back
from the supply room

09:13.779 --> 09:14.611
and picked up my memento.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.129
-What'd you get?
-I got a pad eye.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.538
TONY:
Me, too. Picked it up

09:17.558 --> 09:18.907
-when I first got here.
-What's a pad eye?

09:18.967 --> 09:20.450
-It's like a cleat.
-What's a cleat?

09:20.468 --> 09:22.060
It's a thing
you secure a rope to.

09:22.287 --> 09:23.636
Rope! I know rope.

09:23.713 --> 09:25.546
So, wait, we can just take stuff
from the ship?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.807
-Dibs on that huge cannon.
-TEDDY: No, Louise.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.475
Only sailors
from the maiden voyage

09:29.628 --> 09:31.644
can take something off the ship
before they sink it.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.406
-What are you getting, Teddy?
-Oh, nothing.

09:34.482 --> 09:35.574
What? Why nothing?

09:35.801 --> 09:37.576
'Cause I didn't put in a request
for anything.

09:37.761 --> 09:39.411
They should give a life vest
to Double-Dip.

09:39.638 --> 09:41.487
Ha! Good one, Billy.
That was a good one.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.808
-Right. Double-D?
-(laughs) Yeah. I'm not upset.

09:44.826 --> 09:47.602
-(laughs, sighs)
-Hello, ma'am.

09:47.604 --> 09:48.903
Beers for my friends

09:48.922 --> 09:50.814
and, uh, have you ever heard
of a Twisted Monkey?

09:50.816 --> 09:53.499
-I have not.
-It's a ginger ale and ice,
twisted.

09:53.652 --> 09:56.319
And then you make a noise like
a monkey when you give it to me.

09:56.412 --> 09:57.503
I don't know
if I want to do that.

09:57.656 --> 09:59.264
Okay, I'll make the noise
like a monkey.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.324
Wait, Teddy, I don't get it.

10:01.417 --> 10:02.601
Why didn't you ask
for part of the ship?

10:02.828 --> 10:03.935
I didn't think I was gonna come.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.419
Plus, what was I gonna write
on the letter?

10:05.439 --> 10:07.963
"Hi, I'm the guy
who fell off the ship twice.

10:07.965 --> 10:09.332
Can I please have something"?

10:09.351 --> 10:10.275
They probably
would've stamped it

10:10.426 --> 10:12.093
with "Request denied, idiot."

10:12.187 --> 10:14.020
Thank you.
(imitates monkey)

10:14.114 --> 10:15.447
Not so hard, is it?

10:15.598 --> 10:18.432
Well, is there a part
of the ship that you would want?

10:18.526 --> 10:19.951
I mean,
I wouldn't say no to a pad eye.

10:20.103 --> 10:22.178
Who would? It's a pad eye.
It's like a cleat.

10:22.271 --> 10:24.013
Well, then,
let's get you a pad eye.

10:24.032 --> 10:26.199
We can't. The request
had to be in months ago.

10:26.351 --> 10:28.685
-There's got to be a way.
-Nah, forget it.

10:28.778 --> 10:30.962
I don't even deserve
part of the ship. (sighs)

10:31.189 --> 10:35.300
Teddy, uh, Louise and I
are gonna... go pee!

10:35.451 --> 10:36.376
She shouted.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.861
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll be right back.

10:37.863 --> 10:39.304
Listen,
it's not right that Teddy

10:39.455 --> 10:41.698
doesn't get anything
from this ship while Tony

10:41.791 --> 10:43.032
gets to take a pad eye with him

10:43.051 --> 10:44.476
even though he was
a total poop deck to Teddy

10:44.627 --> 10:46.478
-the whole time.
-They never said
the sea was fair.

10:46.705 --> 10:48.629
I say we find a way
to get Teddy something.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.391
Something better than a pad eye.
That's how he'll win.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.377
Yeah, that kind of makes sense
in a dumb, beautiful way.

10:54.396 --> 10:57.563
So, are you in for operation
"Go Get a Part of the Ship

10:57.716 --> 10:59.232
from That Supply Room Place
for Teddy"?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.808
-Uh, yeah. Sure.
-Okay.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.977
Thought there was gonna be
a little more energy there,

11:02.996 --> 11:04.387
-but great.
-And after that,

11:04.406 --> 11:06.331
-we find the frickin' torpedoes.
-There's the energy.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.042
But probably not
with the torpedo thing.

11:13.248 --> 11:14.488
So, what's the plan?
We're just gonna ask

11:14.582 --> 11:15.565
for a piece of the ship
for Teddy?

11:15.583 --> 11:16.916
We'll ask nicely.

11:17.235 --> 11:19.493
And we'll say, "Please make it
slightly better than a pad eye."

11:19.587 --> 11:21.070
Nope. Can't do that.

11:21.164 --> 11:23.014
-Pretty please?
-Uh, no.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.575
-Aw, frigate.
-Okay, good start. Good start.

11:25.668 --> 11:28.502
And that is how you tie
the sheet bend knot.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.264
Can't wait till someone asks me
how to do a sheet bend.

11:31.416 --> 11:32.765
Still working on the bowline?

11:32.918 --> 11:34.192
Almost got it.

11:34.343 --> 11:36.252
There! I did it! Damn it.

11:36.271 --> 11:38.012
I bet Schmitty
can tie a bowline.

11:38.106 --> 11:39.531
Schmitty can tie any knot.

11:39.758 --> 11:42.275
He even invented his own knot:
the Schmitty Liddy.

11:42.427 --> 11:44.202
Best knot in the world
for securing lids.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.762
-So cool.
-GENE: Mm-hmm.

11:45.855 --> 11:48.264
Why, oh, why would God bless you
with Schmitty's face

11:48.283 --> 11:50.934
-but curse you with those hands?
-I don't know.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.602
Okay, everybody done
with the sheet bend?

11:52.620 --> 11:54.938
Hold them up.
Looking good. I'll...

11:54.956 --> 11:56.381
check in with your bowline
in a bit.

11:56.608 --> 11:59.050
Maybe a little time apart
will do us both some good.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.385
I'm gonna get it.

12:00.612 --> 12:02.278
You, uh, you kids
want to learn hitch knots?

12:02.371 --> 12:03.613
Hitch, please.

12:03.631 --> 12:05.223
LINDA:
There's got to be
a piece of this ship

12:05.450 --> 12:07.116
you can give our friend
that no one's claimed.

12:07.135 --> 12:08.451
He's really nice.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.544
A little sad but nice.
He's not too sad.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.546
Look, next time
your friend wants a souvenir

12:12.566 --> 12:14.640
from an $80 million piece
of U.S. military property

12:14.735 --> 12:17.902
that requires prior approval,
he might want to plan ahead.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.571
It just seems like
there are so many parts

12:19.722 --> 12:22.148
still on the ship, and it's
getting sunk next week, and...

12:22.300 --> 12:24.909
Scuttled. (scoffs)
Sorry about my mom.

12:25.061 --> 12:26.244
It's okay. I have one, too.

12:26.395 --> 12:27.579
Listen, we come from land,

12:27.730 --> 12:29.748
and we can get you
any land thing you want.

12:29.824 --> 12:32.584
I could be back here
in 20 minutes with magazines,

12:32.811 --> 12:34.978
potato chips, houseplants,

12:34.996 --> 12:36.421
water that's not salty.

12:36.572 --> 12:38.815
Please don't try and bribe me
with potato chips

12:38.833 --> 12:40.833
and houseplants.
It's very insulting.

12:40.986 --> 12:43.928
I've been off a ship once.
I know about that stuff.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.413
-LINDA: But...
-I'm gonna start
ignoring you two.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.099
Please go
somewhere not here now.

12:48.251 --> 12:49.917
I think we're getting close.

12:50.011 --> 12:51.344
Ugh! Stupid rope.

12:51.496 --> 12:53.420
It's not the rope's fault.
Have you ever been checked

12:53.515 --> 12:55.498
for whatever it is
you seem to have?

12:55.517 --> 12:56.441
Rope dyslexia?

12:56.610 --> 12:58.443
I guess maybe
I just don't get knots.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.520
But you're good
at lots of other stuff, Dad.

13:00.672 --> 13:02.447
Like making burgers. Uh...

13:02.616 --> 13:05.358
-Gene, you want to jump in here?
-Folding towels.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.510
Folding towels.
I was just about to say that.

13:07.529 --> 13:09.954
Actually, I'm not that good
at folding towels.

13:10.181 --> 13:11.197
(whispers):
He's not.

13:11.366 --> 13:13.625
-Well, that was a bust.
-Poor Teddy.

13:13.776 --> 13:15.351
He deserves something
from this ship.

13:15.444 --> 13:17.444
Hey, if you want to do
another look-see down below

13:17.464 --> 13:19.022
for a torpedo
they might've forgotten about,

13:19.040 --> 13:21.524
-I'm with you.
-Ugh, I hate when bullies win.

13:21.617 --> 13:23.635
These guys
and the Debbie Bernardinis

13:23.862 --> 13:27.196
and the Biffs and whoever
the bad guy in<i> Superman</i> was.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.640
-I hate it!
-(bell clangs)

13:28.867 --> 13:29.790
Huh.

13:29.884 --> 13:32.051
-What are you doing?
-Who, me?

13:32.203 --> 13:33.478
I'm just noticing
how this bell...

13:33.588 --> 13:35.388
(grunts) ...seems to want
to be off this ship.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.315
(grunts)
And if it just falls off,

13:37.466 --> 13:39.317
then it's not
like we took it at all.

13:39.468 --> 13:40.985
-(grunts)
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's like a loose tooth.

13:41.212 --> 13:42.153
It wants to come out.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.880
(grunts)
Whoopsie!

13:43.898 --> 13:46.324
-(gasps)
-Mama, you make me so proud.

13:46.475 --> 13:48.142
Hi, sailors. How you doing?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.144
Oceans, huh? So much water.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.055
All right, come on, come on.
Let's give this to Teddy

13:52.148 --> 13:53.406
and get out of here.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
Where have you been?
I stress-ate all the crab cakes,

13:55.651 --> 13:57.651
and now I'm starting in
on the cocktail weenies,

13:57.671 --> 13:59.395
and everyone keeps giving me
the evil eye.

13:59.414 --> 14:00.746
Can we go now, please?

14:00.899 --> 14:05.176
Yes, we can leave now,
but you're gonna leave a winner.

14:05.328 --> 14:06.419
Eh?

14:06.571 --> 14:08.847
-Why do you have that?
-We got it for you.

14:08.998 --> 14:11.182
A little souvenir.
Better than a pad eye.

14:11.334 --> 14:12.575
I mean, it's bigger. Jingly-er.

14:12.668 --> 14:15.428
He's speechless.
A simple "thank you" is fine.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.929
Why would you think
I'd want this bell?

14:17.082 --> 14:18.264
This is the deck bell.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.416
It's the bell they rang
when I fell overboard.

14:20.435 --> 14:22.193
I hear this bell
in my nightmares.

14:22.420 --> 14:26.272
Well, now you can hear it
when you're awake. Right?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.758
Also, you can't steal something
off a navy ship.

14:28.776 --> 14:30.017
You can get in big trouble.

14:30.111 --> 14:32.278
We got to put it back
before anyone notices.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.372
Or we just toss it overboard?
A little mini scuttle?

14:34.599 --> 14:36.449
No. We got to put it back
on the wall.

14:36.601 --> 14:38.209
They're gonna ring it
at the end of the ceremony.

14:38.361 --> 14:39.878
It says it in the program.

14:40.029 --> 14:41.604
Okay, okay.
We'll do it. Calm down.

14:41.623 --> 14:44.123
We'll put it back real quick
and pretend this never happened,

14:44.217 --> 14:45.775
and we get out of here
before they, uh,

14:45.793 --> 14:47.460
dust it for fingerprints. Right?

14:47.536 --> 14:49.370
You didn't wipe yours off?
It was the first thing I did.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.039
Ladies, gentlemen, sailors,
the ceremony's

14:52.133 --> 14:53.299
about to start shortly,

14:53.451 --> 14:54.951
so please begin
to take your seats.

14:55.044 --> 14:57.061
If you have to hit the head,
now's the time.

14:57.213 --> 14:59.956
"The head" is what the navy
calls the bathroom.

14:59.974 --> 15:01.065
Isn't that fun?

15:01.217 --> 15:02.233
Well, now everyone's
going to the bathroom

15:02.460 --> 15:03.401
right next
to where the bell was.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.219
-Yeah, that's not helpful.
-Oh, boy.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.979
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
We got to do something.

15:07.132 --> 15:08.648
Teddy, it's gonna be okay.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.467
Uh, time for operation
"Put the Bell We Got for Teddy

15:11.486 --> 15:13.469
-Back on the Wall."
-Damn it, I hate this situation,

15:13.488 --> 15:15.413
-but I love that name.
-It's fine.

15:19.568 --> 15:21.068
All right, Mom. How are we
gonna unring this bell?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.420
We're just gonna, uh, wait here

15:22.571 --> 15:24.071
till that bathroom line
goes down,

15:24.165 --> 15:25.572
-then we'll put it back.
-OFFICER: Will the sailors

15:25.667 --> 15:27.667
from the maiden voyage
and their guests

15:27.761 --> 15:29.093
please fill in the front row.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.762
-Oh, boy.
-Uh-oh.

15:30.913 --> 15:32.096
Double-Dip, come on!

15:32.248 --> 15:33.580
Uh, I'll be right there!

15:33.675 --> 15:35.099
Eh, we got to go sit down.

15:35.251 --> 15:36.509
Okay, okay.
Uh, we'll go sit down.

15:36.678 --> 15:39.086
And then we'll sneak away
in a minute. Act natural.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.163
-(bell clangs quietly)
-Oh, boy.

15:40.181 --> 15:42.848
Maybe walk less clang-y?

15:43.001 --> 15:44.850
Uh, oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.094
And maybe don't shout "Oh, God"
quite so loud?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.763
-(whispers): Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God, oh God.
-Better.

15:49.857 --> 15:50.782
(Bob whimpers)

15:50.933 --> 15:52.341
Uh, I'm gonna need
that rope back.

15:52.435 --> 15:53.767
I really want to get
to the ceremony.

15:53.861 --> 15:55.861
Can I borrow it
for a little longer?

15:55.938 --> 15:58.030
You really want to tie
that bowline, huh?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.273
Yes, I really do.

15:59.367 --> 16:00.792
I like that dedication, sailor.

16:01.019 --> 16:02.518
You can use the rope
a little longer.

16:02.611 --> 16:04.036
-Thanks.
-Don't worry, Dad,
you'll get it.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.022
(whispers): I'm starting to get
really worried about Dad.

16:06.191 --> 16:08.115
(whispers): Yeah,
is something wrong with him?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.616
Um, I can hear you guys.

16:09.694 --> 16:11.210
I-I'm fine. I-I think.

16:11.362 --> 16:12.453
-Mm-hmm. Totally.
-Uh, yeah,
of course you're fine.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.364
-(whispers): He's not fine.
-Mm-mm.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.366
A little announcement
before we begin.

16:17.385 --> 16:20.219
I've been told that more
crab cakes are being microwaved,

16:20.371 --> 16:23.372
so those of you
who haven't got any yet,

16:23.391 --> 16:25.208
-just hang tight.
-I'm sorry. No one said anything

16:25.301 --> 16:26.726
-about a limit.
-OFFICER: Today,

16:26.878 --> 16:31.380
we give the USS<i> Gertrude Stein</i>
the send-off she deserves.

16:31.399 --> 16:33.049
The chaplain
will read a few words,

16:33.067 --> 16:36.052
and then the deck bell will ring
one final time.

16:36.054 --> 16:37.495
But first,
we're gonna kick things off

16:37.646 --> 16:40.981
with everyone's favorite
navy rock and roll trumpet band.

16:41.075 --> 16:43.501
Take it away, Brass Kissers!

16:43.652 --> 16:45.652
(playing "Barracuda")

16:45.747 --> 16:48.397
(whispering): Okay,
it looks like the bathroom line

16:48.416 --> 16:49.565
has thinned out.
I think now's our chance.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.250
(whispering):
We fly in fast and low.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.327
Stay under their radar.
Get in, get out.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.162
(whispering): I don't know
how I'm gonna reattach

16:55.181 --> 16:56.514
the bell without any tools.

16:56.665 --> 16:58.182
You're overthinking it.
You're overthinking it.

16:58.334 --> 16:59.559
(whispering): Hey,
what are you guys talking about?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.002
-Nothing. Enjoy the music.
-I'm trying to,

17:02.022 --> 17:03.187
but there's a lot of whispering.

17:03.339 --> 17:04.914
Shush, shush, shush.
Play with your rope.

17:05.007 --> 17:06.524
Teddy, Louise and I
all have to go to the bathroom

17:06.751 --> 17:08.526
-at the same time. Come on.
-I want to go to the bathroom.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.010
-No. You stay.
-Okay.

17:10.104 --> 17:12.255
I didn't actually have to go.
It just sounds fun.

17:12.348 --> 17:13.439
(whispering):
I kind of have to go.

17:13.608 --> 17:14.866
-Hold it.
-Okay.

17:15.017 --> 17:17.243
(music continues)

17:18.446 --> 17:20.854
Hey. You went to the bathroom.
That's cool.

17:20.948 --> 17:23.449
-Nice.
-Teddy, you get the bell back
on the wall,

17:23.601 --> 17:26.269
and Louise and I will make sure
nobody comes this way.

17:26.362 --> 17:27.603
Hi.

17:27.696 --> 17:30.940
Oh, it's you guys.
Um, excuse me? I need to get by.

17:31.033 --> 17:33.292
-What's the rush?
Enjoy the view.
-Right.

17:33.444 --> 17:35.553
Okay, I need to hit the head,
so move?

17:35.780 --> 17:37.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
but, like, you could hold it

17:37.632 --> 17:38.631
if you wanted to, right?

17:38.783 --> 17:40.207
I assume
the military trained you

17:40.226 --> 17:41.893
to hold it
during a combat mission.

17:42.044 --> 17:43.877
Actually, we're trained
to just let 'er rip.

17:43.971 --> 17:45.288
Clean things up later.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.214
-Now, please, move it.
-Oh, no.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.757
-MAN: Hey.
-Eh, you're not done yet.

17:48.810 --> 17:50.568
-MAN: Am, too.
-All right,
what the heck's going on?

17:50.719 --> 17:52.795
-(Teddy grunting)
-And what the heck is he doing?

17:52.930 --> 17:54.906
You're stealing the deck bell?!

17:55.817 --> 17:57.909
-Oh, God.
-Okay,
maybe I wasn't<i> done,</i> done,

17:58.060 --> 17:59.802
but still, not cool.

17:59.821 --> 18:01.821
I swear
I wasn't stealing the bell.

18:01.973 --> 18:05.491
-He was. I caught him.
-(singsongy): Embarrassing.

18:05.643 --> 18:07.643
Will someone please explain
to me what's going on here?

18:07.662 --> 18:10.421
I need to know if I'm filling
out a report or not.

18:10.573 --> 18:13.091
Teddy didn't take the bell.
I did.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.533
-Linda?
-(gasps) Mother.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.669
Oh, that's why I wasn't part
of the pee-pee club.

18:16.821 --> 18:18.838
(sighs) I dodged a bullet.
But I still have to go.

18:18.932 --> 18:22.082
-Teddy was just putting it back.
-I had nothing to do with this.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.326
I'm just a little girl.

18:23.419 --> 18:24.827
I knew
I shouldn't have come today.

18:24.846 --> 18:27.680
But it was all, if I don't go,
Tony and those jerks win.

18:27.832 --> 18:30.683
-Wait,
what do you mean, "jerks"?
-Yeah, ouch.

18:30.835 --> 18:31.943
You guys
never stopped teasing me

18:32.170 --> 18:33.169
after I fell off the ship.

18:33.262 --> 18:35.020
Then you came up
with Double-Dip.

18:35.173 --> 18:36.339
Double-Dip? What?

18:36.432 --> 18:38.023
I mean,
because you fell off. Twice.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.617
Oh, then that is
a solid nickname.

18:39.768 --> 18:41.435
(chuckles): What,
we're not supposed to tease you?

18:41.529 --> 18:44.180
It's what sailors do.
It's what friends do.

18:44.273 --> 18:45.456
You think we're friends?

18:45.533 --> 18:47.350
Sure, we are.
But, Teddy, you stand here,

18:47.368 --> 18:49.034
and you tell us
how you fell off the ship,

18:49.129 --> 18:50.444
and then you fall off the ship.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.130
I mean, how does that
even happ... (screams)

18:52.357 --> 18:55.115
-(splash)
-Oh, my God! Should you jingle
the clingy clangy?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.135
The-the jingle bellies?
Jingle the thingy.

18:57.286 --> 18:59.786
-Oh, right.
-(clanging)

18:59.955 --> 19:03.123
-Little more slack over here,
Billy! Let it out!
-Copy that!

19:03.143 --> 19:05.217
Tony, keep that strap
above your chest!

19:05.370 --> 19:07.478
Otherwise, your nipples
are liable to chafe!

19:07.630 --> 19:08.813
Trust me on that one!

19:08.964 --> 19:10.464
Raul, how're we doing
with your line?

19:10.558 --> 19:11.965
My hands are greasy
from the hors d'oeuvres.

19:12.043 --> 19:13.709
I can't get a grip.
Schmitty lookalike,

19:13.728 --> 19:16.970
-tie this off for me, will you?
-Oh, um, I-I-I don't...

19:16.990 --> 19:18.823
-I don't know...
-Come on, Dad. You can do it.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.324
-Maybe.
-We believe in you.

19:20.476 --> 19:22.735
-Stick the knots landing.
-TEDDY: It's okay, Bob.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.144
I'll come over.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.146
No, I can... I can do this.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.557
The rabbit comes up
from his hole,

19:28.651 --> 19:30.409
runs around the tree,

19:30.561 --> 19:33.504
then goes back into his hole
and...

19:33.656 --> 19:35.356
(gasps)
I did it!

19:35.433 --> 19:38.176
I did it! Knot teacher guy,
look! I did it!

19:38.252 --> 19:40.994
-Well, I'll be.
-I totally get
the tree part now.

19:41.014 --> 19:44.015
-He<i> can</i> do the easiest knot.
-And the rabbit.
Take that, Schmitty.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.257
Geez, I guess I was wrong.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.077
It is, uh, kind of easy
to fall off this ship.

19:48.170 --> 19:50.429
So, you guys teased me
because we were friends?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.932
What? Of course.
We served together.

19:53.008 --> 19:54.250
We're bonded for life.

19:54.268 --> 19:55.717
I mean,
we were all kids then, Teddy.

19:55.719 --> 19:58.421
And you were a little older.
We-we looked up to you.

19:58.439 --> 20:00.439
And I was scared out of my mind
about serving,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.091
but then you showed me
you could make a mistake

20:02.109 --> 20:03.609
and still be a great sailor.

20:03.761 --> 20:05.203
Gave me a lot of confidence.

20:05.354 --> 20:07.780
-Wow. I had no idea.
-SAILOR: Hey, Double-Dip.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.540
I got something for you.

20:10.435 --> 20:12.435
-The bell? Really?
-SAILOR: Yeah.

20:12.453 --> 20:13.860
It'll remind you
of the good old days

20:14.029 --> 20:15.120
and also today

20:15.273 --> 20:16.881
when you fished out
Mr. Slips Ahoy.

20:17.032 --> 20:19.275
-(laughter)
-Mr. Slips Ahoy over here.
-That's pretty good.

20:19.368 --> 20:21.368
Let's just pretend
you sent a request letter

20:21.387 --> 20:23.446
and it has all
the right signatures on it.

20:23.464 --> 20:25.038
But maybe put it down your pants

20:25.058 --> 20:26.224
till you get off the ship,
please.

20:26.451 --> 20:28.375
-Can I hide it in my jacket?
-No. Pants.

20:28.469 --> 20:29.952
Yeah, pants is better.
Put it in your pants.

20:29.971 --> 20:32.212
-Come on.
-Okay, I'll try. Thank you.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.714
Aw, Teddy got the bell.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.716
-All because of me.
-I mean...

20:35.735 --> 20:37.217
Thank you
for your service, Mom.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.477
If I fall off the ship,

20:38.629 --> 20:40.238
do you think that lady
will give me a torpedo?

20:40.465 --> 20:42.314
Hey, maybe you should reach out
to your old friends, too, Mom.

20:42.467 --> 20:43.741
And then you can make up
and wear matching jackets.

20:43.892 --> 20:46.635
I would, sweetie, but I TP'd
Debbie Bernardini's house

20:46.654 --> 20:48.637
after they started calling me
Death by Chocolate.

20:48.656 --> 20:50.489
And I peed on her bike.
But I shouldn't have.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.899
Kids, do the Teddy thing,
not the Mama thing.

20:53.035 --> 20:54.493
Oh, and I called them
at 2:00 in the morning

20:54.587 --> 20:56.420
every night for a year
and pretended I was a killer.

20:56.572 --> 20:57.571
