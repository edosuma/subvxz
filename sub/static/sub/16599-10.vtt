WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:06.105
You're safe here, Reese.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.007
Let my voice be your guide

00:08.009 --> 00:11.176
as you feel the tension
dissolve from your muscles,

00:11.178 --> 00:15.481
and your eyelids grow
heavier and heavier...

00:15.483 --> 00:17.750
until they close.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.521
Now, I'd like you to imagine

00:22.523 --> 00:24.590
you're at the top
of a tall staircase.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.327
<i> As I count back from ten,</i>

00:28.329 --> 00:33.065
<i> I would like you to take</i>
<i> one step with each count...</i>

00:33.067 --> 00:37.169
<i> growing more and more relaxed.</i>

00:37.171 --> 00:39.538
<i> Ten...</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.206
<i> nine...</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:42.141
<i> eight...</i>

00:44.578 --> 00:46.812
<i> Keep going.</i>

00:46.814 --> 00:48.747
<i>When you get to the fifth step,</i>

00:48.749 --> 00:52.217
<i> you will enter the water.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:55.721
<i> Walk into the water.</i>

00:55.723 --> 00:57.389
<i> Let it surround you.</i>

00:57.391 --> 01:00.225
<i> By the time you reach zero,</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:03.095
<i>you'll be completely submerged.</i>

01:03.097 --> 01:05.664
<i> Completely...</i>

01:05.666 --> 01:08.367
relaxed.

01:08.369 --> 01:13.138
Reese, you're now
in a hypnotic trance.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.607
In this state,
I'd like to explore the source

01:15.609 --> 01:17.743
of your anxiety.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.146
In your nightmares,
tell me what you see.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.218
The woods.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.240
(breathing heavily)
What is it, Reese?

01:48.242 --> 01:49.875
No, no, no!

01:49.877 --> 01:52.244
What's there?

01:52.246 --> 01:53.579
What do you see?

01:56.150 --> 01:58.617
There!

01:58.619 --> 02:00.586
OFFICER:
Let's go!

02:01.589 --> 02:04.356
Lock the area down.
Lock it down.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.400
I got something.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.269
Reese, don't!

02:22.409 --> 02:23.642
Did I do this?

02:25.146 --> 02:28.680
Mom... Dad...

02:28.682 --> 02:30.182
Did I do this?!

02:32.186 --> 02:34.253
<i> (Hawaii Five-O </i>
theme song plays)

03:08.422 --> 03:10.422
STEVE: Okay. So, which
one's your sister?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.424
I'm looking.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.592
Since when do
insurance agents

03:13.594 --> 03:15.194
get to have
this much fun?

03:15.196 --> 03:16.662
I wouldn't worry about it,
buddy.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.930
If she's anything like you,

03:17.932 --> 03:19.264
I'm sure she's having
a miserable time.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.632
She's nothing like me.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.301
I mean, she's like
a bucket of sunshine.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.569
Glass is always
half-full...

03:23.571 --> 03:26.238
with her, you know?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.472
That's my sister
right there.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.574
MAN: I got it.
WOMAN: What are you doing?

03:28.576 --> 03:29.608
Right, right,
right, right, right.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.642
We're going too far left.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.244
That's your sister?

03:32.246 --> 03:33.278
Yeah.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.580
You got it.
Go, go, go, go!

03:34.582 --> 03:35.747
Dig! Dig!

03:35.749 --> 03:37.783
Yeah, she's...
she's pretty cute.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.451
What's the matter with you?
That's my baby sister.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.452
Why don't you tell him that?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.004
That guy's getting
a little handsy.

03:42.005 --> 03:43.555
I thought you said she was married.
She is married.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.790
He's spotting her.
He's doing the thing.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.292
He's-he's spotting her?
Yes.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.793
That is a man who
just rounded first base

03:47.795 --> 03:49.328
and is getting ready
to slide into second.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.295
That-that's my sister.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.597
You're sick.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.598
You got it!
You got it!

03:52.600 --> 03:53.865
Go, go, go!

03:53.867 --> 03:55.400
(whoops)

03:55.402 --> 03:56.935
Well played.

03:56.937 --> 03:57.970
Bridget!

03:57.972 --> 03:58.971
Hey.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.473
Uh, I'll be right back.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.741
Look at you,
on a paddleboard.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.008
I'm very impressed.
(laughs)

04:04.011 --> 04:06.378
Hey.
Oh, man, I love Hawaii.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.946
You know it's snowing
back in Jersey?

04:07.948 --> 04:09.481
Bridget, this is Steve,
my partner.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.250
And this is my baby sister, Bridget.
Aloha.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.252
Hi. It's great to finally meet you.
Welcome to Hawaii.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.786
Great to meet you. You know,
I've heard a lot about you.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.722
I hope, uh, at least
some of it was good.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.390
Mm, yeah.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.825
What's that? What's... Mostly.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.026
Well, my mother
called you a catch.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.861
I love your mother.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.596
(laughs) By the way,
while I have you,

04:24.598 --> 04:25.931
it's a little late,
but thank you very much

04:25.933 --> 04:27.332
for the cookies
you sent Danny and I

04:27.334 --> 04:28.867
when we were, uh,
recovering in hospital.

04:28.869 --> 04:29.668
That was very sweet.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.736
Oh, yeah, no problem.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.437
How's the new liver?
It's good.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.605
Thank you very much.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.772
But I have been reading
in these medical journals

04:34.775 --> 04:36.675
that sometimes
the recipients

04:36.676 --> 04:38.576
of organ donations start taking
on the traits of the donor,

04:38.579 --> 04:39.945
so I'm a little concerned
about that.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.813
Ooh, yeah, let's hope
that doesn't happen;

04:41.815 --> 04:44.049
one Danny is more than enough.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.417
Oh, look at that,
what you guys did.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.784
You got something in common,
that's so nice. Aw.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.987
(phone ringing)
Excuse me for a second, please.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.656
It's McGarrett.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.592
Okay, copy that, I'm on the way.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.593
Guys?

04:54.595 --> 04:55.828
Hey, uh, listen.
Huh?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.062
I'm really sorry,
I got to rain check brunch.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.964
Okay? But you stay,
have a nice visit.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.532
Enjoy yourself.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.667
Yeah, I'm sorry
you're gonna miss out.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.957
Me, too. I hope I...

05:02.958 --> 05:04.246
I hope I get to see you
again before you leave.

05:04.247 --> 05:05.535
Yeah, same here. All right.
MAN: Bridget!

05:06.340 --> 05:07.673
We got to go.
Yeah.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.375
(mouthing) Yeah, yeah, one sec.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.510
MAN:
All right.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.644
STEVE: Bye, guys. Bye.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.316
CHIN:
<i> So, when you get the message,</i>

05:17.318 --> 05:20.452
please... give me a call back.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.320
Thank you.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.888
Bye-bye.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.989
Hey, cuz.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.424
Hey.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.359
Oh, everything okay?

05:27.361 --> 05:28.393
(sighs)

05:28.395 --> 05:30.229
You know, I don't know.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.064
Sara and I usually talk
every day, but I haven't heard

05:32.066 --> 05:33.432
from her in almost a week.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.833
I keep leaving messages

05:34.835 --> 05:36.401
for Jorge and Maria but--

05:37.838 --> 05:38.970
I can't help thinking that

05:38.972 --> 05:40.906
they're distancing us
on purpose.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.841
Well, you know, um,
she's at a new school,

05:42.843 --> 05:44.343
making new friends.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.011
That's probably all it is.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.946
Why don't you try that again

05:47.948 --> 05:50.349
and maybe, uh,
this time look me in the eye?

05:51.985 --> 05:55.354
Cuz, you don't really
want to know what I think.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.690
Actually, I do.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.562
Okay.

06:03.564 --> 06:07.933
I think you might have taken
things too far.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.703
Multiple background checks,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.438
having a judge
delay the adoption.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.775
I mean, you even used Sara
to recon their house.

06:18.379 --> 06:23.148
If I was them, I wouldn't
want you in Sara's life.

06:24.918 --> 06:28.153
Cuz, I love you.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.622
But you're gonna have to make
things right with that family

06:30.624 --> 06:32.691
if you want to have any kind
of relationship with Sara.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.096
(sighs)

06:39.967 --> 06:42.534
You know what?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.836
You're right.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.972
You're right.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.841
Thank you.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.977
So, why are they
hypnotizing this kid again?

06:51.979 --> 06:55.580
His therapist was trying
some New Age mumbo jumbo.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.482
According to her,
Reese suffered

06:57.484 --> 06:58.784
from a lot of blackouts.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.519
There'd be like-like
whole chunks of his day

07:00.521 --> 07:01.553
that he couldn't remember.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.855
Oh, excuse me.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.156
I'm sorry, just to,
just to be clear,

07:04.158 --> 07:05.190
you're telling me that

07:05.192 --> 07:07.058
an emotionally
disturbed teenager

07:07.060 --> 07:08.660
who's been having blackouts

07:08.662 --> 07:11.129
now all of a sudden knows
where a body is buried?

07:11.131 --> 07:12.781
Yeah.

07:12.782 --> 07:14.432
I mean, obviously,
we got HPD sitting on him

07:14.435 --> 07:15.801
until we know more, but yeah.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.606
Gentlemen, what I have here
are the remains

07:21.608 --> 07:23.608
of an adolescent female,
estimated to be

07:23.610 --> 07:25.076
16 to 18 years of age.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.446
Unfortunately,
due to the extent

07:27.448 --> 07:30.048
of the soft tissue decay,
I cannot actually determine

07:30.050 --> 07:31.917
the time or cause of death.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.585
However, based on the

07:33.587 --> 07:36.521
compound fractures to the torso,
and the blow to the anterior

07:36.523 --> 07:38.623
of the skull, I can safely say

07:38.625 --> 07:40.892
that our victim died
an extremely violent death.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.961
Hmm. You have an I.D.?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.197
Not yet, but I did send
bone marrow samples

07:45.199 --> 07:46.898
to the DNA lab for processing.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.667
Oh, and, uh, I found this CD.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.170
This was inside
her jacket pocket.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.473
"I'm sorry.
Meet me at nine.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.874
Our spot."

07:55.876 --> 07:57.642
Well, maybe we should run
that over to Eric,

07:57.644 --> 07:58.910
see if he can pull
some prints off it.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.579
maybe match it to Reese.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.881
Guys, we got a hit
on that bone marrow DNA

08:02.883 --> 08:04.249
in the Missing Persons'
Database.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.717
You're not gonna believe it...

08:05.719 --> 08:06.918
this is Maggie Reed.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.221
Maggie Reed?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.623
Are you sure
about that?

08:11.625 --> 08:12.824
100% match.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.159
Who's Maggie Reed?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.962
Maggie was a star softball
player at Kukui High.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.564
Ten years ago, she-she left
the house one night.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.533
She never came home.
It was a huge case.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.568
Half the island was
looking for this kid.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.603
You say ten years ago?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.704
Yeah.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.872
Well, that would make Reese

08:26.874 --> 08:27.906
only eight
when Maggie was killed.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.940
Yeah, I think it's safe to say

08:28.942 --> 08:30.642
he didn't do this.
Yeah.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.612
Well, then how the hell did he
know where the body was buried?

08:33.614 --> 08:34.679
I don't know.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.556
So, at the moment,
we believe your son witnessed

08:44.558 --> 08:47.292
somebody burying Maggie Reed's
body in the woods ten years ago.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.829
Now, according to
your therapist, Reese,

08:50.831 --> 08:53.265
at that age, seeing
something like that,

08:53.267 --> 08:55.300
it's possible you
could've blocked it out

08:55.302 --> 08:56.652
as a way to cope.

08:56.653 --> 08:58.003
GROVER: Thing we're having
a little difficult time

08:58.005 --> 08:59.871
understanding, though,
is how an eight-year-old

08:59.873 --> 09:02.274
ends up out in the woods
that time of night,

09:02.276 --> 09:04.075
you know, in the first place.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.278
Well, we used to live
in Maunawili, so...

09:06.280 --> 09:08.013
those woods were
behind our house.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.548
We used to go camping
there sometimes.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.550
And Reese played
in those woods

09:11.552 --> 09:13.218
almost every day.
All the neighborhood kids did.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.953
Even at night?

09:14.955 --> 09:17.088
Well... there
were a few times

09:17.090 --> 09:19.057
I snuck out after dark.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.794
I had this, um, this little fort
that my friends and I built.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.696
I'd hang out there when, uh...

09:25.666 --> 09:27.599
...if you guys were fighting.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.201
GROVER:
So, then it's possible

09:30.203 --> 09:32.571
that you went out there
during an evening or something,

09:32.573 --> 09:36.274
or maybe you snuck out while you
went camping, either-either way,

09:36.276 --> 09:38.009

You've been lying
to me for years.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.159
I lied to you because I knew
you'd never believe me.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.562
Come on. I know how this goes.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.665

how things happened
with you and Maggie.

18:34.380 --> 18:38.182
We'd been seeing each other
for a few months.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.552

18:41.554 --> 18:44.622

to hide it anymore.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.729
But she said we had to.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.566
I thought she was ashamed of me.

18:55.568 --> 18:59.537
It turned...
into this huge fight.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.306
I-I was being a jerk.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.842
I wanted to tell her
I was sorry.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.211
So, I-I made her that CD

19:07.213 --> 19:09.647

her bedroom window.

on that CD, uh,

19:12.652 --> 19:15.520
you said "our spot." Where
was... where was your spot?

Yeah...

19:33.773 --> 19:35.806

No.

some problems.

Only person I confided in.
Only person I laughed with,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.814

Every day I was with her, right?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.849
One day, I come to work,

20:51.851 --> 20:54.885

21:01.561 --> 21:03.294
that whole thing?
I recognized it.

what I would be destroying if I,
if I went forward with this,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.578

needs to be let out,

for the kids,

I got to race back.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.941
I have to make dinner,
make sure their homework's done,

28:30.943 --> 28:34.445
walk the dog, and then
it just starts all over again.

28:34.447 --> 28:37.081
I'm doing it
all by myself.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.451
Ted's never around.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.352
I mean, our parents
are never in town.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.288
And if they are in town,
they need something.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.989
Guess who's handling
all that.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.458
Yeah, me.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.760
Because you guys left years ago.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.462
I have no support.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.497
I have no one to turn to.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.202
Honestly,

28:58.204 --> 29:01.371
I feel like, every day...

29:01.373 --> 29:05.309
I get closer to...

29:05.311 --> 29:06.944
completely disappearing.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.181
Until one day,
I walk into work,

29:11.183 --> 29:15.085
and someone actually sees me.

29:23.829 --> 29:25.462
Spencer's a friend. Okay?

29:25.464 --> 29:28.165
He's... he's there for me.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.871
Okay.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.975
I-I don't understand.
Do you want my blessing or...?

29:37.977 --> 29:40.811
For what?
Nothing's even happened.

29:40.813 --> 29:41.779
Nothing's happened yet.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.914
God. (sobs softly)

29:43.916 --> 29:45.716
(sniffles)

29:45.717 --> 29:47.517
God knows you're a saint, Danny,
but if you could just be

29:47.520 --> 29:49.553
a human being for one second.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.455
Can you even hear me?

29:51.457 --> 29:52.823
I am lonely.

29:52.825 --> 29:55.559
I am so unhappy.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.094
What am I supposed to do?

29:57.096 --> 29:59.196
I don't know.

29:59.198 --> 30:02.499
Go try therapy, get separated
for a little while.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.034
Well, I'm sorry, unlike you,

30:04.035 --> 30:05.568
I can't just walk away
from my children.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.938
Uh-huh.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.874
(smacks lips)

30:10.876 --> 30:13.544
You know, my, um, my children
can look me in the eye

30:13.546 --> 30:15.379
and they can know
that I never lied.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.883
Aloha. Can I start you two off
with some cocktails?

30:20.853 --> 30:22.019
No, thank you.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.574
Hello.

30:43.576 --> 30:46.343
Hey. How'd it go?

30:46.345 --> 30:48.278
I don't want to talk
about that right now.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.413
What the hell's
going on?

30:49.415 --> 30:50.881
What'd you do,
dig a grave?

30:50.883 --> 30:52.082
Yeah, I did, actually.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.350
Wilson didn't do it.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.853
Okay.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.855
You need to stop, okay?

30:57.857 --> 30:59.556
The kid confessed.
It is over.

30:59.558 --> 31:00.591
It's not over, Danny.

31:00.593 --> 31:01.959
I leave you alone
for two seconds.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.093
What is the
matter with you?

31:03.095 --> 31:05.295
Hear me out.
Would you, please?

31:05.297 --> 31:08.232
All right, now...

31:08.234 --> 31:11.301
the night of, Wilson's coworkers
say he left work,

31:11.303 --> 31:13.003
what, 8:30, right?

31:13.005 --> 31:15.539
And we got witnesses that
put him at the bar in Waimanalo

31:15.541 --> 31:17.374
at 10:00 p.m.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.208
Which means Wilson
had to leave work,

31:19.211 --> 31:22.880
drive to Sherwood Beach,
meet Maggie, kill Maggie,

31:22.882 --> 31:25.949
drive Maggie's body
back to the woods,

31:25.951 --> 31:28.652
dig a three-by-five-foot hole,
bury the body,

31:28.654 --> 31:31.355
clean the evidence off the car,
clean the evidence off himself,

31:31.357 --> 31:33.924
all in an hour and a half;
which I can tell you right now

31:33.926 --> 31:35.926
is impossible,
because I just tried it.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.160
Okay.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.395
Yeah?

31:38.397 --> 31:42.065
What if their spot was actually
in the woods,

31:42.067 --> 31:43.600
and it wasn't in the beach?
He lied about that?

31:43.602 --> 31:46.270
Doesn't matter. I did a bunch
of different equations,

31:46.272 --> 31:48.672
none of them make sense, none of
them fit for the timeline.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.524
None of it works.

31:50.525 --> 31:52.375
Okay, what if he
pre-dug the hole?

31:52.378 --> 31:54.945
Pre-dug the hole?
That close to the road?

31:54.947 --> 31:56.413
And three feet deep?

31:56.415 --> 31:57.981
I mean, that's some pretty
poor advance planning.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.416
Wouldn't you say?

31:59.418 --> 32:00.484
Not to mention

32:00.486 --> 32:02.486
she was beaten to death.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.988
Somebody caved
this girl's head in.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.323
That-that's a crime of passion.

32:06.324 --> 32:07.657
It's something that
happens in the moment.

32:07.660 --> 32:10.093
Premeditation almost always
involves a weapon.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.630
All right, let's say this
all that makes sense,

32:13.632 --> 32:15.532
we have one major problem.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.567
What's that?
Kid confessed.

32:17.569 --> 32:18.669
Come on, man.

32:18.671 --> 32:20.237
Wilson broke the moment
we showed him

32:20.239 --> 32:21.371
the photo of Maggie's remains.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.040
He blames himself for her death.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.575
As far as he's concerned,
Maggie wouldn't have even

32:25.577 --> 32:28.445
left her house that night
if it wasn't for him, all right?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.047
So the guilt of that,

32:30.049 --> 32:32.582
plus Yang harassing him
for ten years,

32:32.584 --> 32:35.352
I swear, man, the kid just
wanted it to be over.

32:35.354 --> 32:38.221
(sighs)

32:38.223 --> 32:40.223
All right, so now what?

32:40.225 --> 32:41.591
Back to Uncle Icy?

32:41.593 --> 32:43.260
No, Uncle Icy
didn't do it, either.

32:43.262 --> 32:46.330
Turns out in 2006,
he didn't even have his truck.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.231
But I got something else,
we got to go for a drive.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.102
(car engine stops,
door slams shut)

32:52.104 --> 32:53.570
Okay, so the crime scene's
about 100 feet into the woods

32:53.572 --> 32:54.438
this way, right?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.073
I'm walking back to my truck

32:56.075 --> 32:57.207
when I see that.

32:59.712 --> 33:02.679
All right? So I call Uncle Icy,
and I ask him

33:02.681 --> 33:04.748
if he's ever done any
advertising in this area.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.384
And he sends me this.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.553
"Always Fresh, Always Cold."

33:09.555 --> 33:11.054
So the kid did
not see his truck,

33:11.056 --> 33:12.622
but he saw that sign.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.024
Correct, but here's the thing,

33:14.026 --> 33:15.492
you can't see that sign
from the grave site.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.994
You got to be on the road.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.762
Right, so what is an
eight-year-old kid

33:18.764 --> 33:21.999
doing on the road at night?

33:22.001 --> 33:23.166
He's in an automobile.
He's got to be in a car.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.735
So I think, "What if Maggie Reed

33:24.737 --> 33:26.336
was on this road, too?"

33:26.338 --> 33:28.705
I checked, there's a bus
stop about a mile down there.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.775
And that bus stops
at Sherwood Beach.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.311
STEVE:
<i> Now that,</i>

33:34.313 --> 33:35.679
along with Max's report

33:35.681 --> 33:38.081
that said Maggie Reed
suffered compound fractures.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.517
Right, injuries that

33:40.519 --> 33:42.352
she could've gotten
if she was hit by a car.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.055
A car that eight-year-old
Reese Holland

33:45.057 --> 33:47.224
was a passenger in the back of.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.592
So, in theory, whoever
was the driving that car,

33:48.594 --> 33:49.726
killed Maggie Reed.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.028
(car engine revving)

33:51.030 --> 33:52.095
(tires screech, Maggie screams)

33:58.570 --> 34:00.670
KONO: I pulled Reese's
family's DMV records.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.707
And it turns out that Reese's
dad filed an insurance claim

34:03.709 --> 34:05.609
on his car in 2006.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.711
He said he hit a boar.
Hmm.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.212
But according to the M.E.,

34:09.214 --> 34:11.248
if he was going about
30 miles an hour,

34:11.250 --> 34:12.582
and hit a 200 pound boar,

34:12.584 --> 34:13.717
there would've been
a lot more damage.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.520
Whatever he hit
was more like 120.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.622
Which was roughly
Maggie Reed's weight.

34:18.624 --> 34:22.259
GROVER: We also found that
the height of the bumper

34:22.261 --> 34:25.062
with this car was consistent
with Maggie's injury.

34:25.064 --> 34:26.596
When was this claim filed?

34:26.598 --> 34:28.382
KONO:
That's the thing.

34:28.383 --> 34:30.167
Fred Holland filed it the
day after Maggie went missing.

34:30.169 --> 34:33.203
Son of a bitch.

34:33.205 --> 34:36.339
Ten years
I was chasing the wrong guy.

34:36.341 --> 34:39.276
What kind of cop
does that make me?

34:39.278 --> 34:40.510
It makes you the
type of cop that cares.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.646
All those years weren't wasted.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.114
You kept Maggie's memory alive,

34:44.116 --> 34:45.382
and now you get
to call her parents

34:45.384 --> 34:46.683
and tell them that
we found her killer.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.485
DANNY:
This is all really good.

34:48.487 --> 34:51.788
I like this, but unfortunately
this evidence is circumstantial.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.490
How we gonna get Fred Holland?

34:53.492 --> 34:55.392
I got an idea.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.461
♪ ♪

35:01.533 --> 35:03.600
(clock ticking)

35:05.104 --> 35:06.436
SILVER:
That's good, Reese.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.871
Your body is numb.

35:07.873 --> 35:10.273
You're completely relaxed.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.708
(door opens)

35:11.710 --> 35:12.809
What's going on here?

35:12.811 --> 35:15.212
Why didn't we know about this?
Sir,

35:15.214 --> 35:18.615
your son is 18-years-old, he
consented to this session, okay?

35:18.617 --> 35:21.384
And you know that our son
is not well.

35:21.386 --> 35:22.752
W-Why are you putting
him through this again?

35:22.754 --> 35:24.521
He's told you everything
he knows.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.156
Well, that's-that's the thing,
he may have told us,

35:26.158 --> 35:27.224
but you have not.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.492
What's that supposed to mean?

35:28.494 --> 35:30.427
Ten years ago your
car was in an accident,

35:30.429 --> 35:32.129
the very night that
Maggie Reed died.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.497
We know that 'cause
you filed a report.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.498
You said you hit something.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.333
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.601
It was, it was a boar.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.269
Except it wasn't a boar, was it?

35:39.271 --> 35:41.338
What are you implying?

35:41.340 --> 35:44.674
What we're implying, sir,
is that your son is not well.

35:44.676 --> 35:47.644
That he's not well because
he saw something so traumatic

35:47.646 --> 35:49.446
he couldn't process it.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.714
Commander, this
is all a mistake.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.782
Okay.
Honey, let me handle this.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.252
Don't pretend that
you care about him.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.553
You're just using him.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.787
Excuse me, sir.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.756
Maybe your wife's right.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.558
Maybe this is a mistake.
Why don't we find out?

36:01.560 --> 36:05.695
Okay? Humor me for one minute.

36:05.697 --> 36:09.766
Doctor, if you could ask
Reese about the car, please.

36:12.804 --> 36:16.940
Reese, let's go back to
that night in the woods.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.776
And then, farther back.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.945
Back to a car.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.750
Where are you, Reese?

36:26.752 --> 36:29.586
Our car.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.788
The backseat.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.857
(emergency lights clicking)

36:46.872 --> 36:48.471
(seatbelt clicks)

36:51.777 --> 36:54.778
Who else is with you?

36:54.780 --> 36:56.346
No one, I'm alone.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.894
(singing softly)

37:24.876 --> 37:26.009
(grunting)

37:35.887 --> 37:37.921
(panting)

37:42.327 --> 37:44.427
Mommy?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.599
I see my mommy.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.369
She's all dirty.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.916
You told me that was a boar.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.852
You told me
that was a boar.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.520
Now, now tell them

38:10.522 --> 38:12.322
that this is nonsense.

38:13.959 --> 38:17.427
Mrs. Holland...

38:17.429 --> 38:20.864
(crying):
It was an accident.

38:20.866 --> 38:24.868
I'd, I'd had some wine
that night.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.470
Too much.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.240
We'd been fighting.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.009
We were in such
a bad place then.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.778
I was upset.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.080
I had to get out of the house,

38:37.082 --> 38:40.984
so I... I grabbed Reese

38:40.986 --> 38:43.687
and I took your car.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.055
We were gonna go to a hotel.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.904
(both scream, then crash)

39:00.906 --> 39:03.073
Why didn't you just
call the police?

39:03.075 --> 39:07.010
YANG: Because that's not
how she died, is it?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.978
Maggie had a skull fracture,

39:08.980 --> 39:12.349
except it wasn't from
being hit by a car.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.460
I was so afraid
they'd take Reese away from me.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.994
I panicked.

39:30.402 --> 39:33.103
I'm sorry.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.572
I'm so sorry.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.640
♪ ♪

39:43.782 --> 39:45.849
(sobbing)

40:01.933 --> 40:03.633
STEVE:
All right.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.035
What are you gonna say to her?

40:06.037 --> 40:08.671
I don't know.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.573
You want me to pick you up?

40:10.575 --> 40:12.175
No.

40:12.177 --> 40:16.012
Uh, in fact, once again,
I could've just driven myself.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.148
Yeah, I know. All right.
Thank you, though.

40:18.150 --> 40:20.850
Just call me if you
want me to pick you up.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.519
I don't want you to pick me up.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.766
(sighs)

40:36.768 --> 40:37.901
What do you want, Danny?

40:37.903 --> 40:39.503
Uh...

40:39.504 --> 40:41.104
I-I don't want, uh,
I don't want anything.

40:41.106 --> 40:44.641
I just want you to know
that I love you very much.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.043
And I obviously do not

40:47.045 --> 40:49.112
have all the answers.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.182
If I did, I'd probably
still be with Rachel.

40:52.184 --> 40:55.819
I'm f-far, very far
from perfect.

40:57.689 --> 41:00.457
Bridget, if you do this,

41:00.459 --> 41:02.926
you cannot take it back.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.527
Maybe it'd make you happy
for a little bit,

41:04.529 --> 41:05.962
but, at the end of the day,
it's just...

41:05.964 --> 41:08.064
it's just gonna
make things worse.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.603
And all that stuff about
you being alone is not true

41:13.605 --> 41:16.105
because I am
here for you always.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.141
Always, you call me,
I pick up the phone.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.476
No matter what.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.077
Okay?
Forever.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.814
Hmm?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.850
Thank you.

41:26.852 --> 41:27.851
That's it.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.052
That's all I got.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.120
Do you want to come in?

41:31.122 --> 41:33.156
No, I don't want to
interrupt anything.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.190
I mean, you're all dressed up.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.493
(chuckles)
Get in here, you jerk.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.161
Thanks.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.195
Wait a minute.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.130
Ugh.
This...

41:41.132 --> 41:43.533
this is what you flaked
on me, for a cheeseburger?

41:43.535 --> 41:45.101
Yeah, well, plans changed.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.537
Oh! You're watching
<i> Smokey and the Bandit?</i>

41:47.539 --> 41:49.105
Yeah.
Without me?

41:49.107 --> 41:50.940
We watched 6,000
times when we were kids.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.141
I know, I still love it.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.143
Burned out the VHS tape. I'm in.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.211
Uh-huh.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.747
You know what?
What?

41:57.749 --> 42:00.049
Steve kind of reminds me
of the Bandit.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.050
Why? 'Cause he's
reckless and arrogant?

42:01.052 --> 42:04.120
(laughs)

42:04.122 --> 42:05.722
SHERIFF BUFORD:
Let me have a...

42:05.724 --> 42:07.857
Diablo sandwich, a Dr. Pepper,
and make it fast.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.192
I'm in a damn hurry.

42:09.194 --> 42:10.059
BRIDGET:
Remember when you tried to grow

42:10.061 --> 42:11.528
that mustache?

42:11.530 --> 42:13.796
Yeah, don't tell Steve
about that, please.

42:13.798 --> 42:14.797
Okay.

42:14.799 --> 42:16.566
I'm serious.

42:16.568 --> 42:20.703
10-4, good buddy.

42:20.705 --> 42:24.274
Come on.

42:24.276 --> 42:26.576
You must be in a hell of a
hurry, huh, Sheriff?

42:26.578 --> 42:28.711
BUFORD AND BRIDGET:
Bet your ass on that, boy.

42:28.713 --> 42:29.779
(both laugh)
Uh-huh.
