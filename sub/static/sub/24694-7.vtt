00:19.701 --> 00:21.133

>> BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST
THING I WANNA DO, THAT'S WHY.

00:23.534 --> 00:26.133

00:26.133 --> 00:27.467
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

00:27.467 --> 00:31.000

>> YOUR HOTEL'S NOT THAT FAR.
I'LL JUST GET MY COAT.

01:25.267 --> 01:28.601

WITHOUT HIM.

03:23.434 --> 03:26.367
TELL HER HOW GREAT SHE LOOKS.

03:26.367 --> 03:29.667
>> YOU KNOW, I--
I DON'T TRUST THIS THING.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.501

SHOULD I GO?

03:33.267 --> 03:36.300
>> THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.033
>> IS SOMETHING...WRONG?

03:41.033 --> 03:46.467
NO. HE'S PROBABLY JUST
GOING OUT FOR A SMOKE.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

03:49.234 --> 03:50.400
>> POLICE ARE ON THEIR WAY, SIR.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.701

03:51.701 --> 03:52.968
YOU'D THINK SOMEONE WOULD BE
ABLE TO STEP UP--

>> I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO THE PARENTS.

05:51.901 --> 05:57.100
>> THEY'RE IN THE ROOM
NEXT DOOR.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.501
>> I CAME UP TO CHECK ON HER
AT 8:15.

06:01.501 --> 06:03.334
>> I THINK IT WAS
CLOSER TO 8:30.

06:03.334 --> 06:05.033
>> WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

06:05.033 --> 06:06.901
HOW DOES SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN?

06:06.901 --> 06:08.734
>> YOU'RE GONNA FIND HER,
RIGHT?

06:08.734 --> 06:10.334
YOU'RE GONNA
BRING HER BACK SAFE?

06:10.334 --> 06:13.367
>> RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO TRY TO REMEMBER

06:13.367 --> 06:15.133
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

>> WELL, WE WERE DOWNSTAIRS.
WE WERE ALL HAVING DINNER.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.701
>> BEFORE THAT,
DID YOU RECEIVE ANY CALLS?

06:18.701 --> 06:20.167
>> JUST CELIA.

06:20.167 --> 06:23.634
>> VISITORS?

06:23.634 --> 06:26.000
AND YOU'RE SURE YOU LOCKED UP
WHEN YOU LEFT.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.167
>> OF COURSE I'M SURE.

06:28.167 --> 06:31.167
I KNEW WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT HER ALONE.

06:31.167 --> 06:34.467
>> WE'LL NEED
A PICTURE OF EMMA.

IT'S OUR BACKYARD.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.834
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE.
THIS IS A GOOD HOTEL.

06:48.834 --> 06:52.234
I PUT THE SIGN ON THE DOOR.
I CHECKED THE THERMOSTAT.

06:52.234 --> 06:53.801

SHE WAS WARM.

06:55.567 --> 06:59.200

EMMA WAS ILL?

06:59.200 --> 07:01.367
>> SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
COMING DOWN WITH A COLD, YEAH.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.167
[exhales] OH, GOD.

07:03.167 --> 07:05.601
>> WE KNOW THIS IS
DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

07:05.601 --> 07:09.734
BUT IF IT IS A KIDNAPPING,
SOMEONE MAY TRY TO CONTACT YOU.

07:09.734 --> 07:13.534
SO IT'S BEST IF YOU STAY HERE,
AT LEAST UNTIL WE KNOW MORE.

07:15.367 --> 07:18.033
>> IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

07:18.033 --> 07:19.167
>> THEY LEAVE THEIR KID ALONE

07:19.167 --> 07:20.767
SO THEY CAN HAVE
A QUIET DINNER?

07:20.767 --> 07:22.767
PEOPLE JUST DON'T THINK.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.167
>> LUCY VALDEZ.

07:24.167 --> 07:25.934
SHE'S BEEN A MAID HERE
FOR THREE YEARS,

07:25.934 --> 07:27.167
NEVER A PROBLEM.

07:27.167 --> 07:29.067
ALL OUR STAFF ARE BONDED.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.567
>> HER MASTER WAS USED
ON ALL THE ROOMS THAT WERE HIT.

07:31.567 --> 07:33.567
>> AND 20 OTHERS.
THAT'S HER JOB.

07:33.567 --> 07:36.200

07:44.234 --> 07:46.634
THE NEXT TIME THE DOOR
WAS OPENED WAS 8:36.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.200
THE HASLUMS' KEY.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.534
>> VALDEZ, YOU SAID.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, LUCY.

07:52.534 --> 07:55.267

AT 7:01.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.534
>> WE'LL NEED A HOME ADDRESS.

07:57.534 --> 08:03.100
>> THANKS, LUCY.
JUST WAIT HERE.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.701
MAID'S KEY CARD
WAS USED TWICE THAT NIGHT.

08:05.701 --> 08:07.834
SHE CLAIMS
SHE ONLY USED IT ONCE.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.801
>> BOYFRIEND?
>> ALIBIED UNTIL 11:00 P.M.

08:10.801 --> 08:12.534
>> YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
THE GLASS FRAGMENTS.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.634
FOUND 'EM IN ALL SIX ROOMS
THAT WERE HIT.

08:14.634 --> 08:16.701
COULD HAVE BEEN TRACKED IN
BY THE BURGLAR'S SHOES.

08:16.701 --> 08:18.434
FORENSICS IS RUNNING
GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY

08:18.434 --> 08:19.801
AS PER YOUR REQUEST.

08:19.801 --> 08:22.167
>> THANKS, MAN.

08:22.167 --> 08:25.834
>> SO WE GOT THIS KEY CARD
FROM THE MAID'S LOCKER.

08:25.834 --> 08:30.000
NOW, WE TESTED IT, AND IT
DOESN'T FIT IN ANY OF THE DOORS.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.901
>> SOMEONE SWAPPED CARDS.
>> YEAH.

08:31.901 --> 08:35.900
IT WAS LAST USED BY MARVIN
CUTLER FROM SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY,

08:35.900 --> 08:39.734
WHEN HE CHECKED INTO
THE HOTEL TWO WEEKS AGO.

08:39.734 --> 08:42.333
>> AND WE KNOW THIS HOW?
>> 'CAUSE IT'S ON HERE.

08:42.333 --> 08:45.067
NAME, ADDRESS,
CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.

08:45.067 --> 08:48.868
DON'T LEAVE YOUR KEY CARD
IN YOUR ROOM WHEN YOU CHECK OUT.

08:48.868 --> 08:52.167
UNFORTUNATELY, MR. CUTLER
REPORTED HIS WALLET STOLEN

08:52.167 --> 08:54.400
TWO HOURS BEFORE SOMEONE
USED HIS CREDIT CARD

08:54.400 --> 08:55.801
TO CHECK INTO
THE BARTON HOTEL.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.400
WHAT DO YOU HAVE HERE?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.601
>> LUCY WASN'T LYING ABOUT
THE GUY IN THE HAT.

08:59.601 --> 09:03.300
>> SHE CLAIMS HE TALKED HER UP
IN THE ELEVATOR.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.400
>> AND WATCH THIS.
LOOK AT HIS OTHER HAND.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.634
THAT'S WHERE SHE SAID
SHE KEPT HER KEY.

09:08.634 --> 09:13.167
NOW FOLLOW HIS LEFT HAND.

09:13.167 --> 09:16.501
>> HE SWAPS CARDS.
>> DID HE GO BACK UPSTAIRS?

09:16.501 --> 09:19.100
>> UNFORTUNATELY, WE NEVER
ACTUALLY GET TO SEE HIS FACE.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.267
NONE OF THE HOTEL EMPLOYEES
CAN IDENTIFY HIM OFF THIS TAPE.

09:22.267 --> 09:25.901
>> THE OLD "I LEFT MY PHONE
IN MY ROOM" LINE.

09:25.901 --> 09:27.834
>> THAT DUFFLE BAG
IS BIG ENOUGH

09:27.834 --> 09:30.434
TO HOLD
AN 18-MONTH-OLD CHILD.

09:33.734 --> 09:36.100
>> ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.334
MAYBE ONE OF THEM
KNOWS WHERE SHE IS.

09:38.334 --> 09:40.901
>> HEY, WE HAVE TO TRUST
THE POLICE.

09:40.901 --> 09:43.234
>> HOW WOULD THEY GET HER
OUT OF THE ROOM?

09:43.234 --> 09:46.267
YOU THINK THEY HURT HER?
GOD, DO YOU THINK--

09:46.267 --> 09:49.767
>> NO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.767
OKAY? SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
>> I CAN'T HELP IT, ANDRE.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.167
I KEEP THINKING OF EMMA
IN THE GROUND.

09:53.167 --> 09:55.934
>> STOP IT.
>> I KEEP THINKING OF EMMA.

09:55.934 --> 09:58.267
>> SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.834
HEY, WE'D FEEL IT
IF SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.267
NOTHING'S WRONG.

10:03.267 --> 10:06.267
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY'LL FIND HER.

10:06.267 --> 10:08.667
THEY WILL.

10:08.667 --> 10:12.200
>> I'M TELLING THE COPS
WE'RE STAYING AT CELIA'S.

10:14.767 --> 10:18.901
HERE, HOLD THIS.

10:18.901 --> 10:21.234
>> IT SMELLS LIKE HER.

10:21.234 --> 10:23.667
>> HEY.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.834
>> WE'LL BE OKAY.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.033
>> SO THIS ON THE HAT HERE...

10:35.033 --> 10:37.734
>> IT'S THE MIAMI FLAME.

10:39.634 --> 10:42.634
>> OKAY, SO THE VICTIMOLOGY

11:00.133 --> 11:02.334
>> EMILY?

11:02.334 --> 11:04.000
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.400
>> GEORGE IS MY SECRETARY.
YOU CAN SPEAK FREELY.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.934
>> OKAY. WE HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE IT WAS A KIDNAPPING

11:11.934 --> 11:13.400
FOR A RANSOM.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.400
>> BECAUSE THEY KNOW
WHO I AM?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
>> WAS THERE ANYONE
YOU MIGHT HAVE TOLD

11:18.400 --> 11:20.033
YOUR NEPHEW
WAS COMING INTO TOWN,

11:20.033 --> 11:22.400
SOMEONE WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN
WHERE HE WAS STAYING?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
>> I MADE ANDRE'S RESERVATION,

11:24.400 --> 11:27.367
UM, USING HER CREDIT CARD,
OF COURSE.

11:27.367 --> 11:29.467
EMILY, YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.
>> STOP IT, GEORGE.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.667
>> WELL, IF I DON'T WORRY
ABOUT YOU, WHO WILL?

11:31.667 --> 11:34.801
>> JUST GO HOME.
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S IN FROM LONDON.

11:34.801 --> 11:36.667
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
CALLED YOU.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.534
>> STUART CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.

11:38.534 --> 11:42.000
I'LL MAKE COFFEE.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.667
>> EMMA. SHE'S THE ONLY
CHILD IN OUR FAMILY.

11:47.667 --> 11:51.167
SHE'S NAMED AFTER ME,
YOU KNOW?

11:54.534 --> 11:56.901
>> THE GLASS FRAGMENTS
ARE TOTALLY ORDINARY.

11:56.901 --> 12:00.200
COULD BE FROM A BEER BOTTLE,
A WINDOW, A VASE.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.534
>> WHAT'S THAT?
>> THAT'S NOT ORDINARY.

12:03.534 --> 12:05.133
ON MOST OF THE FRAGMENTS,

12:05.133 --> 12:07.534
WE DETECTED TRACES
OF STYRENE AND ISOBUTYLENE.

12:07.534 --> 12:09.968
CHEMICALS FOUND IN
THE MANUFACTURE OF STYROFOAM.

12:09.968 --> 12:12.534
AND THE FLAGS INDICATE
ALL FACTORIES

12:12.534 --> 12:15.701
THAT MANUFACTURE STYROFOAM.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.601
>> GREAT. WHERE DO WE START?

12:17.601 --> 12:19.734
>> WELL, THE BURGLAR
USED CREDIT CARDS

12:19.734 --> 12:21.601
WHICH WERE STOLEN
FROM MARVIN CUTLER

12:21.601 --> 12:23.634
WHO LIVES IN SUMMIT.

12:23.634 --> 12:26.400
LET'S GO TO NEWARK.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.100
>> IN JERSEY,
YOU ROOT FOR MIAMI,

12:30.100 --> 12:31.934
IT'S KINDA LIKE ROOTIN'
FOR IRAQ,

12:31.934 --> 12:35.567
BUT, YOU KNOW, MARKIE, HE--
HE BANGS HIS OWN DRUM.

12:35.567 --> 12:37.801
YO, MARKIE.

12:37.801 --> 12:39.968
GOT A COUPLE
OF MIAMI FANS HERE FOR YOU.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.767
>> STOP! POLICE!

12:41.767 --> 12:43.334
>> SUSPECT IS ON THE MOVE.

12:49.567 --> 12:51.968
[tires squealing]

13:03.367 --> 13:06.133
[tires screeching]

13:08.434 --> 13:12.767
>> PUT YOUR HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!

13:19.234 --> 13:21.100
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
THERE IS NO KID.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.167
>> WE HAVE YOU ON THE SECURITY
TAPE FROM THE HOTEL,

13:23.167 --> 13:25.267
MR. CARSTON.

13:25.267 --> 13:29.334
>> NO, YOU'VE GOT A GUY
IN A MIAMI FLAME HAT.

13:29.334 --> 13:32.400
>> WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE BUSTED
12 YEARS AGO

13:32.400 --> 13:35.200
FOR A BREAK-IN
AT A JEWELRY STORE ON 46TH.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.601
>> CHARGES DROPPED.

13:36.601 --> 13:38.467
>> ALSO AT AN ANTIQUE STORE
ON PARK AVENUE SOUTH.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.100
THAT'S TWO YEARS LATER.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.834
>> AND GRADUATED
STUYVESANT HIGH

13:41.834 --> 13:44.300
WHERE I WAS THE PUNTER
ON THE FRESHMAN FOOTBALL TEAM.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.100
>> SOMEONE AT THE BARTON HOTEL
IS GOING TO RECOGNIZE YOU.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.267
>> YEAH, I'VE GOT
ONE OF THOSE FACES, DON'T I?

13:50.267 --> 13:53.200
LOOK, I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.
>> REALLY?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.033
WELL, THEN YOU KNOW
THAT KIDNAPPING

13:55.033 --> 13:57.033
IS A CLASS A VIOLENT FELONY.

13:57.033 --> 13:58.501
WE'RE TALKING LIFE.

13:58.501 --> 14:00.100
>> I DIDN'T TAKE A BABY.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.033
I'VE GOT KIDS OF MY OWN,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

14:02.033 --> 14:04.701
>> YOU KNOW, UH...

14:04.701 --> 14:07.634
I BELIEVE YOU.

14:07.634 --> 14:11.067
IT'S JUST THAT RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.534
YOU NEED TO PROVE IT.

14:12.534 --> 14:14.901
>> WE KNOW YOU WERE
IN THE HOTEL ROOM.

14:14.901 --> 14:16.901
>> [laughs] RIGHT.

14:16.901 --> 14:22.467
>> WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE CAN
PROVE YOU WERE THERE.

14:24.901 --> 14:26.834
>> OKAY.

14:26.834 --> 14:29.767
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
A KIDNAPPER.

14:29.767 --> 14:32.767
>> DID YOU SEE THE BABY?
>> I'M NOT STUPID.

14:32.767 --> 14:34.901
I DO NOT MESS WITH KIDS.

14:34.901 --> 14:38.334
>> STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

14:41.701 --> 14:42.767
>> OKAY.

14:51.434 --> 14:53.868
>> LOTSA JEWELRY, ANTIQUES.

14:53.868 --> 14:57.033
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN
THAT THE KID'S BEEN HERE.

14:57.033 --> 15:00.434
YOU KNOW, THIS KIDNAPPING'S
VERY UNCHARACTERISTIC

15:00.434 --> 15:02.767
FOR A--A PRO LIKE CARSTON,

15:02.767 --> 15:05.767
BUT MAYBE HE FOUND A PARTNER
WHO WOULDN'T MIND THE RISK.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.133
>> OR MAYBE THE BURGLARY

15:07.133 --> 15:09.100
WAS JUST A DECOY
FOR THE KIDNAPPING.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.968
COULD BE ANYTHING.
NONE OF IT LOOKS GOOD FOR EMMA.

15:17.400 --> 15:22.434
>> ...TWO WORDS THAT SHOULD
NEVER GO IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

15:22.434 --> 15:25.133
>> NO, IT'S NOT RIGHT.
CHILDREN DON'T DIE.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.868
CHILDREN DON'T DIE.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

15:26.868 --> 15:29.367
CHILDREN DON'T DIE.

15:29.367 --> 15:30.968
CHILDREN DON'T DIE.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

15:30.968 --> 15:34.501
CHILDREN DON'T DIE.
[muttering]

15:34.501 --> 15:37.467
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

15:37.467 --> 15:40.534
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
CHILDREN DON'T DIE.

15:40.534 --> 15:45.033
NOT RIGHT.
NOT RIGHT.

15:45.033 --> 15:49.934
>> HEY.
[rattling]

15:49.934 --> 15:52.167
HERE ARE YOUR PILLS.

15:56.801 --> 16:00.501
CALISTA, YOU GOTTA TAKE
YOUR MEDICATION.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.200
>> I SEE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.167
YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

16:15.167 --> 16:17.567
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

16:17.567 --> 16:21.133
I TRUST YOU.

16:21.133 --> 16:23.567
I SWEAR.

16:23.567 --> 16:27.667
>> YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW...

16:27.667 --> 16:30.501
[chuckles]

16:30.501 --> 16:34.534
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET
THROUGH THIS IS TOGETHER, OKAY?

16:36.501 --> 16:39.567
[telephone ringing]

16:42.000 --> 16:44.234
>> IF IT IS THE GUY,
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU.

16:44.234 --> 16:45.667
KEEP HIM ON AS LONG
AS POSSIBLE.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.167
PLAY FOR TIME.

16:47.167 --> 16:51.167
YOU NEED A FEW DAYS
TO GET MONEY, STOCK, WHATEVER.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.267
>> YES?

16:53.267 --> 16:55.567
>> WE HAVE YOUR LITTLE GIRL,
AND WE'RE WILLING TO HURT HER.

16:55.567 --> 16:57.133
>> WHO IS THIS?

16:57.133 --> 17:00.200
>> YOU CAN HAVE HER BACK
FOR $2 MILLION.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.534
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS.

17:01.534 --> 17:05.000
>> IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
I WANT TO TALK TO HER!

17:05.000 --> 17:07.601
>> GET THE MONEY.

17:07.601 --> 17:09.133
>> WELL, IT'LL TAKE
A FEW DAYS.

17:09.133 --> 17:11.133
IT'S ALL TIED UP
IN TRUST ACCOUNTS.

17:11.133 --> 17:12.434
>> TOMORROW.

17:12.434 --> 17:16.067
GET THE DAMN MONEY,
OR SHE'S DEAD.

17:28.701 --> 17:33.734
[British accent]
>> RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S THAT.

17:33.734 --> 17:37.834
>> THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

17:37.834 --> 17:40.968
I DON'T WANNA
DO THIS ANYMORE.

17:40.968 --> 17:45.133
>> YOU WILL DO THIS.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.701
>> BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE,

17:51.701 --> 17:54.534
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET
PROOF EMMA IS ALIVE.

17:54.534 --> 17:56.701
>> $2 MILLION
IS MEANINGLESS TO ME.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.868
I WON'T TAKE THE CHANCE
THEY'LL HURT HER.

17:58.868 --> 18:02.467
>> WHAT KIND OF PROOF?
>> TALKING TO HER WOULD BE GOOD.

18:02.467 --> 18:04.868
>> I'LL BE AT THE BANK
AS SOON AS IT OPENS.

18:04.868 --> 18:07.000
>> EMILY, YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.834
>> HOPEFULLY,
WE'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK

18:09.834 --> 18:13.801
WHEN THEY CALL NEXT TIME.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.000
>> EMILY WILL PAY,

18:15.000 --> 18:16.267
AND THINGS
WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL.

18:16.267 --> 18:19.734
SHE LOVES EMMA
LIKE SHE WAS HER OWN.

18:19.734 --> 18:21.834
SO THERE'S JUST...

18:21.834 --> 18:24.400
ONE MORE QUESTION,
MRS. HASLUM,

18:24.400 --> 18:26.467
AND THEN WE'LL--
WE'LL LEAVE YOU.

18:26.467 --> 18:29.267
DOES THE NAME MARK CARSTON
MEAN ANYTHING--

18:29.267 --> 18:34.334
>> I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE,
MY WIFE ISN'T WELL.

18:34.334 --> 18:37.367
CALISTA, THAT'S THE THIEF
FROM THE HOTEL.

18:37.367 --> 18:41.901
HOW COULD HE PLACE THE CALL
IF HE WAS STILL IN JAIL?

18:41.901 --> 18:44.434
>> WELL, WHEN, UM...

18:44.434 --> 18:47.901
WE SPOKE TO THE MAN,
HE SAID "WE HAVE EMMA,"

18:47.901 --> 18:51.901
SO WE WERE THINKING THAT MAYBE
CARSTON HAS A PARTNER.

18:51.901 --> 18:55.701
>> WELL, NEITHER OF US HAS HEARD
OF HIM BEFORE TONIGHT, SO...

18:57.934 --> 19:00.734
>> HE WAS VERY QUICK
TO KEEP HER FROM TALKING TO US.

19:00.734 --> 19:03.267
>> YOU THINK THEY ACTUALLY
KNOW CARSTON?

19:03.267 --> 19:06.667
>> I THINK THAT A BURGLARY
AND A KIDNAPPING

19:06.667 --> 19:08.667
HAPPENING AT THE SAME PLACE,
SAME TIME

19:08.667 --> 19:10.667
IS A HUGE COINCIDENCE.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.133
>> THE HASLUMS ACTUALLY
KIDNAPPED THEIR OWN KID

19:13.133 --> 19:15.467
TO MILK THE AUNT.

19:15.467 --> 19:17.701
>> MAYBE THEY'RE WORKING
WITH CARSTON.

19:17.701 --> 19:21.467
MAYBE THEY USED HIS CRIME
AS AN OPPORTUNITY.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.133
>> EITHER WAY, IF IT'S TRUE,

19:23.133 --> 19:25.767
THE MONEY TRAIL
SHOULD LEAD BACK TO THEM.

19:25.767 --> 19:28.133
>> I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE ANY MONEY

19:28.133 --> 19:29.801
ON ANDRE'S POETRY.

19:29.801 --> 19:34.033
>> AT NEW ENGLAND TRUST,
THEIR MONEY MARKET IS $4,321.

19:34.033 --> 19:37.701
IN CHECKING, $2,697.

19:37.701 --> 19:40.033
NO BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS
THAT I COULD FIND.

19:40.033 --> 19:41.868
>> ANY DEBT?
>> NOT EVEN A MORTGAGE.

19:41.868 --> 19:44.300
THEY RENT IN CONNECTICUT
FOR 750 A MONTH.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.267
THEY FILED A JOINT RETURN
A YEAR AGO.

19:47.267 --> 19:50.734
NO TAXES DUE.

19:50.734 --> 19:52.100
>> THEY BOTH WORKED?

19:52.100 --> 19:54.067
>> JUST ANDRE.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.834
HE TAUGHT AT HILLIS COLLEGE.

19:57.834 --> 20:01.601
>> W-WHAT'S THAT?
>> IT'S UP IN YONKERS.

20:01.601 --> 20:05.634
>> LOOK, WE'RE NOT LISTED IN
THE TOP 100 AMERICAN COLLEGES.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.133
OKAY, IF YOU LISTED
THE TOP 500,

20:07.133 --> 20:08.434
WE STILL WOULDN'T MAKE IT.

20:08.434 --> 20:10.567
BELIEVE ME, ANDRE LET US
KNOW ABOUT IT TOO.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.734
>> SO HE DIDN'T LIKE IT HERE.
>> WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

20:12.734 --> 20:15.300
TWO CLASSES A WEEK.
LOT OF FRESHMEN WOMEN.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.300
>> [scoffs]
>> THERE WERE RUMORS, OKAY?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.267
>> HE WAS ALREADY MARRIED
TO CALISTA BACK THEN,

20:20.267 --> 20:21.767
WASN'T HE?

20:21.767 --> 20:23.467
>> SURE WAS.
SHE WAS A PIECE OF WORK TOO.

20:23.467 --> 20:24.701
SHE'D PARK THAT BEAT-UP CHEVY

20:24.701 --> 20:26.367
IN FRONT OF
THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT

20:26.367 --> 20:28.100
AND SIT THERE ALL DAY.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.267
>> WITH THE BABY.
>> BABY, BOTTLES, DIAPERS.

20:30.267 --> 20:31.467
YOU NAME IT.

20:31.467 --> 20:33.200
ANDRE'S LAST SEMESTER
LAST SUMMER,

20:33.200 --> 20:35.267
IT REALLY GOT OUTTA HAND.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.801
HE'D COME OUT AFTER CLASS.
SHE'D CAUSE A SCENE.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.334
IF SHE COULDN'T FIND HIM,

20:39.334 --> 20:41.267
SHE'D SEARCH ALL THE MOTELS
IN THE AREA.

20:41.267 --> 20:43.534
WHAT THE HELL?
HE CALLED HIMSELF A POET.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.601
CRAZY WOMEN ARE PART OF
THE JOB DESCRIPTION.

20:45.601 --> 20:47.434
>> CALLED HIMSELF A POET?

20:47.434 --> 20:50.267
>> HE PUBLISHED A POEM IN
OUR QUARTERLY LITERARY JOURNAL.

20:50.267 --> 20:53.634
TURNS OUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT.
ROBERT HERRICK DID.

20:53.634 --> 20:55.667
>> IS THAT WHY YOU FIRED HIM?

20:55.667 --> 20:57.434
>> NO. DON'T GET ME WRONG--

20:57.434 --> 21:00.601
PLAGIARISM IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE
EVEN AT HILLIS.

21:00.601 --> 21:03.434
ONLY ANDRE
WAS ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

21:03.434 --> 21:05.634
HE QUIT BEFORE
WE EVER CAUGHT HIM ON IT.

21:05.634 --> 21:07.300
ONE DAY HE JUST STOPPED
SHOWING UP--

21:07.300 --> 21:10.701
NO CALL, NO LETTER,
NO FORWARDING ADDRESS.

21:10.701 --> 21:12.367
'SCUSE ME.

IF I SEE ANY COPS,
I WILL HURT THE GIRL,

WHAT DID WE LEARN TODAY?

23:49.667 --> 23:52.167

THAT'S BRITISH.

24:05.534 --> 24:07.734

24:22.000 --> 24:25.167
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

24:27.234 --> 24:32.567
STOP THAT...PLEASE?

24:32.567 --> 24:33.667
[exhales]

24:33.667 --> 24:36.734
WE DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

24:39.968 --> 24:42.501
I JUST WANTED
WHAT WAS MINE, OKAY?

24:42.501 --> 24:44.467
I'VE RUN HER LIFE
FOR FIVE YEARS.

24:44.467 --> 24:46.634
"GEORGIE, DO THIS, DO THAT.

24:46.634 --> 24:50.033
I'M LONELY, GEORGIE.
DON'T GO."

24:50.033 --> 24:53.567
I WENT TO TUFTS,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

24:53.567 --> 24:56.033
A POET?
OH...[laughing]

24:56.033 --> 24:58.200
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

24:58.200 --> 25:02.434
HE'S...
HE'S GONNA GET EVERYTHING.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.033
>> HE'S HER FAMILY.

25:04.033 --> 25:08.934
>> ALL HE DOES IS SEND PHOTOS
OF THE LITTLE GIRL.

25:08.934 --> 25:10.934
I TAKE CARE OF EMILY!

25:10.934 --> 25:14.434
I CARE ABOUT HER.

25:20.133 --> 25:23.634
AND...ALL I WANTED WAS
FOR HER TO CARE ABOUT ME.

25:27.601 --> 25:31.133
>> HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO EMMA.

25:31.133 --> 25:34.801
MAY I TALK TO HIM?

25:51.701 --> 25:54.234
>> I'M SORRY.

25:54.234 --> 25:55.367
I'M SO SORRY.

25:55.367 --> 25:58.701
>> YOU WERE ALL
I HAD LEFT, GEORGE.

25:58.701 --> 26:01.868
I KNOW ALL ANDRE WANTS
IS MY MONEY.

26:01.868 --> 26:04.167
>> I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
>> NO?

26:04.167 --> 26:07.167
YOU BETRAYED ME.

26:07.167 --> 26:09.834
I WAS GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.
>> NO.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.300
I WAS THERE, REMEMBER?

26:11.300 --> 26:13.133
I WAS THERE TO WITNESS
YOUR WILL.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.634
>> [laughs]

26:14.634 --> 26:17.901
BUT YOU NEVER SAW
MY TRUST DOCUMENTS.

26:17.901 --> 26:20.868
[sniffles]
YOU'RE A FOOL, GEORGE.

26:20.868 --> 26:26.467
ALL YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO
WAS WAIT FOR ANOTHER FEW MONTHS.

26:30.734 --> 26:35.033
I'LL GET YOU A LAWYER.
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU NOW.

26:39.567 --> 26:41.968
>> IT'S ALMOST 48 HOURS,
AND THOSE GUYS ARE A DEAD END.

26:41.968 --> 26:45.634
>> THE HASLUMS' HOTEL ROOM
DOOR WAS OPEN AT 7:22.

26:45.634 --> 26:48.334
THAT WAS CARSTON.

26:48.334 --> 26:51.400
OKAY, AND THEN AGAIN
AT 8:36.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.400
THAT WAS ANDRE.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.000
NOW, CARSTON'S A PRO.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.234
HE WOULD HAVE CLOSED
THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.

26:57.234 --> 26:59.033
>> NO ONE ELSE WAS IN THE ROOM.

26:59.033 --> 27:01.501
>> SO WHAT ARE WE MISSING?
WE'VE BEEN ALL OVER THAT HOTEL.

27:01.501 --> 27:03.367
SECURITY VIDEOS,
ELEVATOR SHAFTS,

27:03.367 --> 27:05.901
FURNACE, LAUNDRY--
THE WINDOWS DON'T OPEN.

27:05.901 --> 27:07.367
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,

27:07.367 --> 27:11.067
THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE CAN
GET THE KID OUTTA THAT HOTEL.

27:14.167 --> 27:18.367
>> MAYBE THEY NEVER BROUGHT
THE KID INTO THE HOTEL.

27:18.367 --> 27:21.234
>> SO WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

27:21.234 --> 27:25.901
>> SO YOU DIDN'T SEE EMMA
IN THE CITY.

27:25.901 --> 27:28.534
>> EMMA'S DEAD, ISN'T SHE?

27:28.534 --> 27:30.100
>> WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

27:30.100 --> 27:32.901
>> BECAUSE IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.567
CALISTA IS SO FRAGILE.

27:35.567 --> 27:38.601
THAT CHILD WAS EVERYTHING...
HER WORLD.

27:38.601 --> 27:41.934
I DON'T KNOW HOW
SHE'S GONNA DEAL WITH THIS.

27:41.934 --> 27:45.400
YOU KNOW SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED
ONCE BEFORE THEY WERE MARRIED.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.934
>> EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS?

27:46.934 --> 27:48.467
>> THERE WAS A BAD SPELL
LAST SUMMER.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.634
ANDRE HAD TO LEAVE HIS JOB.

27:50.634 --> 27:52.868
>> TEACHING AT HILLIS COLLEGE.

27:52.868 --> 27:54.934
>> SO THIS BOOK IS...

27:54.934 --> 27:57.200
IT'S SIGNED BY THE POET.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.300
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
WORTH SOMETHING SOMEDAY.

28:00.300 --> 28:01.534
>> HE HASN'T PUBLISHED

28:01.534 --> 28:03.767
SINCE THEY MOVED UP
TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.634
>> YOU SAW THEM UP IN KENT?

28:06.634 --> 28:09.567
>> NO, I--SO FAR AND...
MY WORK.

28:09.567 --> 28:12.300
[footsteps]

28:12.300 --> 28:14.434
>> HOPEFULLY,
SHE'LL SLEEP NOW.

28:14.434 --> 28:18.100
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
IF SHE CAN GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.801
>> AGAIN?

28:20.801 --> 28:23.567
>> WELL, FIRST YOU SAID
IT WAS A ROBBERY,

28:23.567 --> 28:25.234
AND THEN A KIDNAPPING,

28:25.234 --> 28:27.100
A--A RANSOM PAYOFF...

28:27.100 --> 28:28.767
AND STILL NO EMMA.

28:28.767 --> 28:32.467
>> YOUR AUNT...SHE NEVER
HAD CHILDREN, RIGHT?

28:32.467 --> 28:34.534
>> NO, SHE DIDN'T.

28:34.534 --> 28:37.667
>> THINK OF ALL THAT
MONEY, YOU KNOW...

28:37.667 --> 28:39.834
>> [laughs]

28:39.834 --> 28:41.200
I'VE READ <i>THE ILIAD</i>

28:41.200 --> 28:43.167
IN THE ORIGINAL ATTIC GREEK,
DETECTIVE.

28:43.167 --> 28:44.667
IF YOU WANNA TRIP ME UP,

28:44.667 --> 28:47.667
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE
MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT.

28:47.667 --> 28:50.234
>> THAT'S...ACTUALLY
HOMERIC GREEK, BUT--

28:50.234 --> 28:51.667
>> I SHOULD KNOW!

28:51.667 --> 28:53.667
>> ANDRE, THEY'RE NOT
ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING.

28:53.667 --> 28:57.067
>> YES, THEY ARE.

28:57.067 --> 29:01.000
AND, YES, I TAKE HER MONEY.
SHE'S HAPPY TO GIVE IT TO ME.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.834
IT'S CALLED PATRONAGE.

29:02.834 --> 29:06.467
IT'S RESPECTED,
AND IT'S AS OLD AS THE ARTS.

29:08.467 --> 29:10.400
>> PATRONAGE.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.400
I'D SAY STAGING A KIDNAPPING
IS MORE LIKE EXTORTION.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.734
>> WELL, MAYBE ANDRE'S AUNT
INVITED THEM HERE

29:16.734 --> 29:18.667
SO SHE COULD SEE EMMA
BEFORE SHE DIED.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.267
>> BUT IF ANDRE KNEW
HIS AUNT WAS FAILING,

29:20.267 --> 29:21.534
THERE'D BE NO POINT--

29:21.534 --> 29:23.000
>> YEAH, BUT SAY
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.868
MAYBE SHE THREATENED TO CUT HIM
OUT OF HER WILL.

29:25.868 --> 29:28.901
YOU KNOW, LET'S SAY THEY
STAGED THE DINNER WITH CELIA

29:28.901 --> 29:34.100
FOR AN ALIBI
AND THEY ACT OUT THE KIDNAPPING.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.667
THE BURGLARY'S A COINCIDENCE.

29:37.667 --> 29:41.234
>> SO IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW THEY
GOT EMMA OUT OF THE HOTEL

29:41.234 --> 29:44.100
BECAUSE THEY NEVER
BROUGHT HER TO NEW YORK.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.701
>> EMMA CERTAINLY
LIVED THE LIFE.

29:52.701 --> 29:55.367
>> HOW OLD DO YOU THINK
EMMA IS IN THIS PICTURE,

29:55.367 --> 29:57.234
FIVE, SIX MONTHS?

29:57.234 --> 30:00.033
>> GIVE OR TAKE.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.801
THEY HAVE MORE TOYS
THAN FAO SCHWARZ,

30:05.801 --> 30:09.200
BUT THEY DON'T
BABY-PROOF THE HOUSE?

30:12.801 --> 30:16.067
>> HEY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE HERE?

30:20.734 --> 30:22.767
>> NO SWINGS.

30:33.400 --> 30:38.634
>> THERE'S ONE IN
THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD.

30:38.634 --> 30:41.667
>> I GET SAD
JUST THINKIN' ABOUT HER.

30:41.667 --> 30:45.767
>> WHAT ABOUT ANDRE?
>> HOW DO YOU SPELL POMPOUS?

30:45.767 --> 30:47.868
>> DID EMMA PLAY
IN YOUR BACKYARD?

30:47.868 --> 30:50.801
>> I ASSUME SHE DID.
A LOT OF KIDS DO.

30:50.801 --> 30:52.801
>> BUT YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE?

30:52.801 --> 30:55.801
>> MELANIE AND I SPLIT UP,
WHAT...ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

30:55.801 --> 30:58.234
RATHER THAN MOVE ANNIE--
THAT'S OUR TWO-YEAR-OLD--

30:58.234 --> 31:00.400
SHE STAYS HERE,
AND WE ALTERNATE.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.501
IT'S THE NEW MATH.

31:06.234 --> 31:10.734
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT COLOR
HAIR EMMA HAS?

31:13.334 --> 31:15.701
>> NO? YOU DON'T.

31:15.701 --> 31:17.801
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE CALLED CALISTA?

31:17.801 --> 31:20.534
UH, WAS IT MOM OR MAMA...

31:20.534 --> 31:22.801
MOMMY?

31:22.801 --> 31:24.367
YOU DON'T.

31:24.367 --> 31:26.400
>> OKAY, MAYBE I'M NOT
AS NEIGHBORLY AS I SHOULD BE.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.334
I WORK.

31:28.334 --> 31:31.501
AND WHEN I'M ACTUALLY PERMITTED
TO LIVE IN MY OWN HOUSE,

31:31.501 --> 31:32.968
I SPEND ALL MY TIME
WITH ANNIE.

31:32.968 --> 31:35.734
>> YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
SEEN EMMA, HAVE YOU?

31:35.734 --> 31:38.467
>> I MUST HAVE.

31:38.467 --> 31:42.167
IN ANY CASE,
I'M SURE ANNIE HAS.

31:42.167 --> 31:47.000
>> COULD WE MEET ANNIE?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.667
>> ANNIE?

31:48.667 --> 31:53.234
ANNIE? COME HERE, HONEY.

31:53.234 --> 31:57.033
>> OH!

32:19.367 --> 32:20.467
>> WE'RE VERY...

32:20.467 --> 32:23.000
SORRY TO HAVE TO TELL YOU
THIS.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.033
WE'VE TALKED
TO EVERY PEDIATRICIAN

32:26.033 --> 32:28.767
IN AND AROUND
KENT, CONNECTICUT,

32:28.767 --> 32:31.467
AND NONE OF THEM
HAVE EVER TREATED EMMA.

32:31.467 --> 32:35.501
NOW, WE FOUND PRESCRIPTIONS
IN YOUR NEPHEW'S HOUSE

32:35.501 --> 32:38.701
WRITTEN OVER A YEAR AGO
BY A DOCTOR IN YONKERS,

32:38.701 --> 32:40.501
AND THEY'D NEVER
BEEN REFILLED.

32:40.501 --> 32:43.367
>> [whispers] PLEASE, STOP.

32:43.367 --> 32:46.100
>> SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO EMMA, MRS. HUNTFORD,

32:46.100 --> 32:49.701
AND IT WASN'T
AT THE BARTON HOTEL.

32:56.534 --> 32:59.067
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

32:59.067 --> 33:03.234
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE
EVERYTHING TAKEN AWAY?

33:10.901 --> 33:15.400
MY HUSBAND HAD A STROKE
AT HIS DESK TEN YEARS AGO.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.467
I'LL BE GONE
IN A MATTER OF MONTHS.

33:18.467 --> 33:23.400
WHAT GOOD DID ALL HIS MONEY
DO ME, HMM?

33:36.834 --> 33:39.167
>> THERE'S NO KID?

33:39.167 --> 33:41.200
>> THE PHOTOS WERE OF
THE NEIGHBORS' LITTLE GIRL.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.334
NO ONE'S ACTUALLY SEEN EMMA
FOR SIX MONTHS.

33:43.334 --> 33:45.834
>> SO THEY STAGE A KIDNAPPING

33:45.834 --> 33:47.601
TO COVER UP WHATEVER
WAS DONE TO THAT CHILD.

33:47.601 --> 33:49.734
>> YES. I MEAN...

33:49.734 --> 33:52.067
MAINLY FOR THE BENEFIT
OF ANDRE'S AUNT.

33:52.067 --> 33:53.834
YOU SEE,
EMMA'S THE GOLDEN GOOSE.

33:53.834 --> 33:56.501
IT'S ANDRE'S ONLY CHANCE
OF INHERITING THE MONEY.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.534
>> AND THE MOTHER WENT ALONG?

33:58.534 --> 34:02.501
>> YEAH. MY GUESS IS
CALISTA HAD NO CHOICE.

34:02.501 --> 34:07.100
SHE'S EMOTIONALLY FRAGILE,
AND I THINK ANDRE FED ON THAT.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.766
>> WE FOUND BABY POWDER
THAT WAS NEVER OPENED,

34:09.766 --> 34:13.701
PAMPERS THAT WERE NEVER USED,
TOYS NEVER PLAYED WITH.

34:13.701 --> 34:16.266
SHE BELIEVED EMMA WAS ALIVE.

34:16.266 --> 34:18.868
>> OUT OF GUILT OR REMORSE
OF--OF LONGING,

34:18.868 --> 34:21.833
I THINK CALISTA
NEEDS THE ILLUSION.

34:21.833 --> 34:26.199
IT'S A VARIATION
OF <i>FOLIE A DEUX.</i>

34:26.199 --> 34:30.167
>> AND YOU'RE GOING
TO PROVE THAT...HOW?

34:30.167 --> 34:33.900
>> WE'LL...DESTROY
THE ILLUSION.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.634
>> THE LONGER EMMA'S GONE,
THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT--

34:47.634 --> 34:50.434
>> NO, IT'S TOO EARLY.
DON'T SAY THAT.

34:50.434 --> 34:52.501
[doorbell rings]

34:54.067 --> 34:56.667
>> IT'S SOMETHING
WE MAY HAVE TO FACE.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.934
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:00.901 --> 35:04.968
>> IS THERE NEWS?
>> WE FOUND EMMA.

35:04.968 --> 35:07.334
>> WHAT?

35:07.334 --> 35:10.000
>> I'M SORRY.

35:13.601 --> 35:18.000
>> "SLEEP NO PAIN SHALL WAKE."

35:18.000 --> 35:21.267
>> OUR CHILD IS DEAD,
AND YOU'RE QUOTING MY WORK?

35:21.267 --> 35:23.567
>> WELL, IT'S IN YOUR BOOK,
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR WORK.

35:23.567 --> 35:27.033
IN FACT, IT'S...
CHRISTINA ROSETTI'S.

35:27.033 --> 35:28.701
>> HOW DARE YOU SPEAK
TO HIM LIKE THAT.

35:28.701 --> 35:30.100
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW WE'VE SUFFERED.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.667
OUR CHILD IS GONE.

35:32.667 --> 35:35.601
>> I KNOW SHE IS.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.434
LAST SUMMER.

35:41.367 --> 35:43.067
WHEN THINGS WENT...WRONG?

35:43.067 --> 35:47.234
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MRS. HASLUM?

35:47.234 --> 35:51.934
>> WHENEVER THERE'S A QUESTION
ABOUT EMMA, YOU LOOK TO HIM.

35:51.934 --> 35:55.634
AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE AN ANSWER.

35:58.234 --> 36:00.300
>> YOUR LIFE WITH ANDRE,

36:00.300 --> 36:03.133
T-THE POEMS
THAT HE WROTE FOR YOU

36:03.133 --> 36:06.234
AND THE LOVE
THAT YOU SHARED WITH HIM...

36:06.234 --> 36:10.601
DID THAT END
AFTER YOU HAD EMMA?

36:10.601 --> 36:13.367
>> MY DAUGHTER MEANT
EVERYTHING TO ME.

36:13.367 --> 36:16.100
YOU CAN'T FAULT ME FOR THAT.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.234
>> I'M NOT FAULTING YOU.
I MEAN...

36:18.234 --> 36:21.667
Y-YOU GAVE HER SO MUCH.
WAS THERE ANYTHING LEFT FOR HIM?

36:21.667 --> 36:24.868
>> STOP THIS!
HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT US.

36:24.868 --> 36:27.801
>> WELL, NOW, SEE...
THAT FURY THERE.

36:27.801 --> 36:29.734
THAT--THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

36:29.734 --> 36:31.901
WHEN YOU START TO FEEL
IGNORED?

36:31.901 --> 36:34.300
I-IS THAT WHAT DRIVES YOU...

36:34.300 --> 36:37.267
AFTER OTHER WOMEN?

36:39.367 --> 36:41.801
YOU KNOW THE POEMS
THAT HE WROTE WERE FOR THEM,

36:41.801 --> 36:44.667
NOT FOR YOU.

36:50.501 --> 36:54.067
IS THAT HOW IT ALL
WENT WRONG LAST SUMMER?

36:55.801 --> 37:00.834
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
ABOUT EMMA'S LAST DAY.

37:00.834 --> 37:05.834
DID YOU GO LOOKING
IN THE WRONG MOTEL?

37:05.834 --> 37:08.367
MAYBE IF YOU KNEW...

37:08.367 --> 37:11.367
WHO HE WAS WITH...
HOW--HOW COULD YOU?

37:11.367 --> 37:14.400
SO MANY WOMEN
AVAILABLE TO HIM.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.801
AND NOT JUST STUDENTS.

37:19.367 --> 37:21.501
LET ME READ YOU SOMETHING.

37:21.501 --> 37:23.834
IT SAYS...

37:23.834 --> 37:28.667
"WHAT MUSIC HAVE I SIPPED
FROM YOUR SIREN EYES."

37:28.667 --> 37:31.133
ANDRE, YOUR HUSBAND,

37:31.133 --> 37:33.534
INSCRIBED THIS BOOK

37:33.534 --> 37:38.000
AND GAVE IT TO CELIA.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.133
WERE YOU WITH HIM
THAT DAY?

37:43.767 --> 37:47.100
>> I'M SO SORRY.

38:00.234 --> 38:03.801
>> IT WAS AFTERNOON...

38:03.801 --> 38:05.767
MIDSUMMER IN YONKERS.

38:05.767 --> 38:09.133
IT WAS A TERRIBLY HOT DAY.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.501
>> RIGHT?
>> YEAH...

38:19.501 --> 38:23.567
I BURNED MY FEET
ON THE PAVEMENT.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.901
I LEFT MY SHOES
AT THE HOUSE.

38:25.901 --> 38:28.367
I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO FIND HIM,
I WENT EVERYWHERE.

38:28.367 --> 38:31.501
I KNOCKED ON DOORS
AT ALL THE MOTELS.

38:34.434 --> 38:36.801
>> YOU LEFT EMMA IN THE CAR.

38:36.801 --> 38:42.934
>> YEAH, BUT I LEFT
THE AIR CONDITIONING ON.

38:42.934 --> 38:45.634
>> CHECKED IT LIKE YOU CHECKED
THE THERMOSTAT

38:45.634 --> 38:46.968
IN THE HOTEL ROOM?

38:46.968 --> 38:49.200
>> YEAH. I WOULD HAVE NEVER
LEFT HER IN THE CAR

38:49.200 --> 38:50.934
WITHOUT THE AIR CONDITIONING.

38:50.934 --> 38:54.033
HOW COULD I KNOW THAT
THE ENGINE WAS GONNA DIE?

38:54.033 --> 38:55.501
>> CALISTA, SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

38:55.501 --> 39:00.400
>> HER SKIN WAS SO HOT
TO THE TOUCH, IT WAS WHITE.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.801
SHE DIDN'T MOVE.

39:03.801 --> 39:06.167
I TOOK HER HOME
AND PUT HER IN HER ROOM

39:06.167 --> 39:10.200
AND...PULLED DOWN THE SHADE
SO IT WAS COOL AND DARK,

39:10.200 --> 39:13.267
AND WHEN ANDRE CAME HOME,
HE...LOOKED AT HER.

39:13.267 --> 39:17.334
HE SAID I DID THE RIGHT THING.

39:17.334 --> 39:19.234
HE SAID EVERYTHING
WOULD BE OKAY

39:19.234 --> 39:22.167
IF WE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE.

39:24.868 --> 39:28.067
HE SAID EMMA WAS ALIVE
AND ALL I HAD TO DO

39:28.067 --> 39:31.601
WAS BELIEVE HIM.

39:42.701 --> 39:46.868
BUT EMMA IS DEAD.

39:46.868 --> 39:49.868
SHE'S DEAD.

39:49.868 --> 39:52.968
I KILLED HER.

40:13.767 --> 40:15.868
>> SHERIFF IN SOUTH SALEM
FOUND THE REMAINS

40:15.868 --> 40:17.634
ABOUT 10 YARDS INTO THE WOODS

40:17.634 --> 40:19.834
ON THE PROPERTY
OF AN EMILY HUNTFORD.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.667
>> THAT'S THE LITTLE GIRL'S
GREAT-AUNT.

40:22.667 --> 40:25.667
>> WELL, IT APPEARS
THEY WRAPPED HER IN THIS...

40:25.667 --> 40:28.734
AND THEY FOUND THIS
WITH THE REMAINS.

40:28.734 --> 40:30.501
LOOKS LIKE A POEM.

40:39.367 --> 40:43.701
>> "IT'S NOT DEATH
WHO HOLDS THEE, IT'S LOVE."

40:43.701 --> 40:46.901
YEAH. IT'S STOLEN.

40:46.901 --> 40:48.567
IT'S
ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.

40:48.567 --> 40:51.501
GUY COULDN'T EVEN BE ORIGINAL
FOR HIS OWN DAUGHTER.
