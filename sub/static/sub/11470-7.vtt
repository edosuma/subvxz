WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.400
Previously on "Manhattan"...

00:02.433 --> 00:03.900
We're about to have our
very own plutonium factory.

00:04.233 --> 00:08.233
If our colleagues don't wipe the
Confederate states off the face of the Earth.

00:08.933 --> 00:10.766
You leave for Tennessee tomorrow morning.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.633
I just saw Charlie this morning at the gate

00:13.666 --> 00:15.833
with Helen Prins and a mountain of luggage.

00:15.866 --> 00:17.600
Who's Helen Prins?

00:19.100 --> 00:20.366
Hope you're not too lonely.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.033
All by yourself on that business trip.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.566
I should have brought a book.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.633
You've got a busy day, Mr. Ellis.

00:26.666 --> 00:29.100
If it would be helpful, I can
walk our guests through the plant.

00:29.137 --> 00:30.888
Compartmentalization, Theodore.

00:30.939 --> 00:32.974
I don't think Washington would like that.

00:33.008 --> 00:35.059
But I could use some coffee.

00:35.110 --> 00:36.561
It's Private Dunlavey, right?

00:36.612 --> 00:38.863
Don't pretend you know anything about me

00:38.897 --> 00:42.283
just because you put a bullet
through my dad's mathematician.

00:47.155 --> 00:49.290
You know, I've seen you before.

00:53.028 --> 00:56.464
- Music.
- That's right, music.

00:56.498 --> 00:59.417
The reactor will be fully
operational within a day.

00:59.468 --> 01:01.752
We gave you a list of 22 major hazards

01:01.803 --> 01:03.471
to resolve before we go critical.

01:03.505 --> 01:05.256
And the army intends to give your list

01:05.307 --> 01:06.908
the consideration it deserves.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.644
- When?
- Just as soon as we're critical.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.763 --> 01:47.548
I'm surprised they bothered to call.

01:47.599 --> 01:49.600
You look terrible, by the way.

01:49.635 --> 01:51.519
'Cause you kept me up all night.

01:51.553 --> 01:53.020
You know you talk in your sleep?

01:53.055 --> 01:55.389
That's ridiculous. What did I say?

01:55.391 --> 01:58.225
I have no idea. You were
speaking Flemish or whatever.

01:58.227 --> 01:59.894
Dutch?

01:59.945 --> 02:03.314
I banged on the wall. Apparently
you can sleep through anything.

02:03.365 --> 02:06.951
Why send us 2,000 miles if they're just
gonna ignore everything we tell them?

02:06.985 --> 02:09.152
The US Army is a fickle mistress.

02:12.874 --> 02:15.326
Excuse me. Mr. and Mrs. Donaldson.

02:15.377 --> 02:17.495
The reactor's just shy of criticality.

02:17.546 --> 02:19.630
1,247 channels loaded.

02:19.665 --> 02:21.882
One more and the curtain comes up.

02:21.917 --> 02:23.417
I wouldn't take a bow just yet.

02:23.419 --> 02:25.252
You'll be the one taking bowing.

02:25.287 --> 02:28.506
For whatever reason, you're
still Uncle Sam's favorite nephew.

02:28.557 --> 02:30.675
Honor of initiating criticality is yours.

02:30.726 --> 02:32.059
We're not interested.

02:32.094 --> 02:34.095
Suit yourself.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.518
No, wait.

02:44.523 --> 02:48.159
Gentlemen, after nearly a year at sea

02:48.193 --> 02:50.244
braving perilous waters, we pioneers,

02:50.278 --> 02:52.530
we fearless navigators

02:52.581 --> 02:55.416
have arrived at the New World.

02:55.450 --> 02:57.918
Mrs. Donaldson.

03:36.958 --> 03:39.160
What?

03:39.271 --> 03:41.555
Somebody's got to sail
into the history books.

03:41.557 --> 03:44.475
It might as well be a woman for once.

03:44.526 --> 03:47.194
Better hope the natives are friendly.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.360
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:31.606 --> 04:33.774
If I die of embarrassment today,

04:33.825 --> 04:36.610
do you promise not to
bury me in this uniform?

04:40.282 --> 04:42.500
You... you look fine.

04:42.534 --> 04:44.702
If you're gonna force me to go,
the least you can do is be honest.

04:44.753 --> 04:46.787
You look like a leprechaun.

04:46.838 --> 04:49.507
But you're our leprechaun.

04:51.593 --> 04:54.128
It's all wrinkled.

04:54.179 --> 04:56.881
- Why didn't Paloma iron it?
- Paloma doesn't work for you.

04:56.932 --> 04:58.966
And even if she did, she
hasn't shown up for two days.

04:58.968 --> 05:01.435
Well, so much for my hygiene badge.

05:02.971 --> 05:05.022
She's never even been late before.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.475
I'm gonna go check on her.

05:09.945 --> 05:11.562
What did you say?

05:11.613 --> 05:14.281
I already have a day pass to Santa Fe.

05:14.316 --> 05:17.868
I'll pop by and make sure
that Paloma is all right.

05:19.204 --> 05:21.655
You can't even communicate
with those people.

05:21.657 --> 05:23.624
Not that you would have noticed,

05:23.658 --> 05:26.710
but I've actually picked up quite a
lot of espaÃ±ol in the past six months.

05:28.997 --> 05:30.581
You know, there are some days when Paloma's

05:30.632 --> 05:32.833
just about the only
person I have to talk to.

05:35.086 --> 05:36.921
I'll drive you.

05:36.972 --> 05:38.505
What?

05:38.557 --> 05:39.807
You shouldn't go by yourself.

05:39.841 --> 05:41.508
You could blow a tire out there.

05:42.978 --> 05:44.345
Shouldn't you be at work?

05:44.396 --> 05:46.146
Just take an hour.

05:46.181 --> 05:47.932
Glen can hold down the fort.

05:56.074 --> 05:58.075
Writing in your diary?

05:58.109 --> 06:01.412
Just taking notes for
my report to Dr. Akley.

06:01.446 --> 06:04.365
You know what your problem is, Charlie?

06:04.367 --> 06:07.084
Stuck in Tennessee with the wrong wife?

06:07.118 --> 06:10.004
You've got no sense of adventure.

06:10.038 --> 06:12.506
You need to enjoy life's unpredictability.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.542
I'll take predictable
over reckless every time.

06:17.212 --> 06:19.847
You and Mrs. Isaacs must have
a lot of fun in the bedroom.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.055
Do you know where they
built the first nuclear pile?

06:29.391 --> 06:31.275
Of course. Chicago.

06:31.309 --> 06:32.893
Under the bleachers at
the football stadium.

06:32.944 --> 06:35.062
They were afraid they'd
take out half of Illinois.

06:35.064 --> 06:36.964
Do you know what happened?

06:36.998 --> 06:40.367
They changed the world
and toasted with martinis.

06:40.402 --> 06:43.704
Gentlemen, we have reached the shore.

06:43.738 --> 06:46.040
Criticality!

06:48.159 --> 06:50.995
Are you gonna stand
around licking your wounds

06:51.046 --> 06:55.215
or should we get a celebratory drink?

06:55.250 --> 06:57.001
It's 9:00 A.M.

06:57.052 --> 06:59.003
Predictable.

06:59.054 --> 07:00.304
Anyway, it's a dry town.

07:00.338 --> 07:02.473
Why do you think my suitcase was so heavy?

07:04.175 --> 07:05.392
You packed a bottle of booze?

07:05.427 --> 07:06.810
Four.

07:06.845 --> 07:09.229
In case we had to bribe somebody.

07:11.349 --> 07:12.766
That's not good.

07:12.768 --> 07:15.102
Tell me again how it happened in Chicago.

07:15.153 --> 07:17.438
- This is a level-one alert...
- Shit.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.690
... proceed to your
designated safety areas.

07:21.993 --> 07:23.694
You're in early.

07:23.745 --> 07:26.113
It's lunchtime in London.

07:26.115 --> 07:29.416
And probably raining, but I see
you're not wearing a slicker.

07:31.453 --> 07:33.370
Been first in every
day this week, actually.

07:33.421 --> 07:34.621
Not that it does me any good.

07:34.673 --> 07:36.173
Trying to make myself indispensable,

07:36.207 --> 07:37.508
and who does Frank send to Site X?

07:37.542 --> 07:38.959
The girl with the pearl earring.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.461
Did you ever stop and
think he didn't send you

07:40.463 --> 07:42.513
because you've made yourself indispensable?

07:42.547 --> 07:45.132
Did Frank say that?

07:46.301 --> 07:49.186
Glen, well?

07:49.188 --> 07:51.889
Is it true?

07:51.891 --> 07:54.892
The opposite of a fact is a falsehood.

07:54.894 --> 07:57.811
But the opposite of one profound truth

07:57.813 --> 08:01.648
may well be another profound truth.

08:03.151 --> 08:05.319
What does that mean?

08:05.321 --> 08:07.821
I don't know. I haven't had my coffee yet.

08:20.335 --> 08:21.835
Hello.

08:21.886 --> 08:24.805
I'm sorry. I knocked. Nobody answered.

08:24.839 --> 08:27.674
I'll buy it, whatever you're selling.

08:27.676 --> 08:30.144
I work at the switchboard.

08:30.178 --> 08:32.513
That's a criminal waste of beauty.

08:32.515 --> 08:34.648
Face like that, you belong
on the prow of a ship.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.985
Um, is this building 12?

08:38.019 --> 08:41.488
I have a telephone message for Helen Prins.

08:41.523 --> 08:43.857
She's not here by any chance, is she?

08:43.908 --> 08:46.076
No, no, afraid the
canary has flown the coop.

08:46.111 --> 08:47.778
Chesterfield?

08:47.829 --> 08:49.279
I don't smoke.

08:50.865 --> 08:53.534
Do you know when Mrs. Prins might be in?

08:53.536 --> 08:55.702
Or is it Miss Prins?

08:55.754 --> 08:57.454
Doctor, actually.

08:59.424 --> 09:03.093
You Americans hand out advanced
degrees like mash notes.

09:03.128 --> 09:05.796
No, I wouldn't wait
around for Helen too long.

09:05.847 --> 09:07.915
She's parlayed her looks
into a subsidized vacation

09:07.949 --> 09:10.267
while the rest of us here toil in the dust.

09:10.301 --> 09:12.102
She's pretty, then?

09:12.137 --> 09:14.388
Yeah, I suppose so, in
an irritating sort of way.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.724
I hope it's not urgent.

09:17.726 --> 09:19.309
What?

09:19.360 --> 09:20.978
Your message.

09:21.029 --> 09:23.897
I could pass it on for you if you like.

09:23.948 --> 09:26.033
If you recite it very slowly.

09:27.569 --> 09:30.404
This evening, perhaps, over a stiff drink?

09:32.240 --> 09:34.241
Hey, what do we know about the
gamma emissions from radiolanthanum?

09:34.243 --> 09:36.794
Glen Babbit, may I introduce to
you the lovely and talented...

09:36.828 --> 09:39.213
Mrs. Isaacs.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.381
You shouldn't be in here.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.802
Excuse me.

09:49.224 --> 09:52.059
We removed the control rods
to reinitiate the reaction.

09:52.093 --> 09:53.727
But you still don't know
what triggered the shutdown?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.479
We'll sort it out when we get all the data.

09:55.513 --> 09:57.431
- When will that be?
- Soon enough.

09:57.433 --> 10:00.400
Anyway, we'll be up and running
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

10:00.435 --> 10:02.486
What's that?

10:02.520 --> 10:05.522
Sir, the temperature is rising in the core.

10:05.573 --> 10:08.442
- How fast?
- Five degrees a second.

10:08.476 --> 10:10.110
Turn on the spigots. Let's
give it a cold shower.

10:10.161 --> 10:12.329
Fuel slugs liquefy at 1132 centigrade.

10:12.363 --> 10:14.331
We could melt down in
less than five minutes.

10:14.365 --> 10:17.451
Fail-safe countermeasures
prevent any core melt accident.

10:17.453 --> 10:20.087
We told you there were risks. Nothing
about a nuclear reactor is fail-safe.

10:20.121 --> 10:23.257
- It's just a minor hiccup.
- We've got to get all these people out of here.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.760
Son, I understand you got a PhD and a
healthy sense of your own importance,

10:26.794 --> 10:29.880
but this isn't a college
lecture hall. This is a factory.

10:29.931 --> 10:33.717
So why don't you step off the floor
and let the experts do their job?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.759
You coming?

10:58.436 --> 11:00.270
Hello?

11:02.907 --> 11:04.407
Hello, Paloma?

11:04.442 --> 11:06.276
She's not here. Let's go.

11:06.310 --> 11:08.611
Hello?

11:12.817 --> 11:14.818
Liza, what are you doing?

11:25.713 --> 11:28.164
Isn't it odd?

11:31.252 --> 11:34.838
Paloma spends every day inside our home.

11:36.724 --> 11:38.925
I've never even seen hers.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.881
We shouldn't be here.

11:44.915 --> 11:47.684
Actually, you know what
this place reminds me of?

11:47.735 --> 11:51.187
Do you remember that little
cabin you used to take me to?

11:51.238 --> 11:53.606
Before Callie.

11:53.657 --> 11:55.859
Near Mt. Shasta.

11:55.861 --> 11:57.660
You know, this is your kind of place.

11:57.695 --> 12:01.731
Wood fires, starry skies.

12:02.867 --> 12:04.534
Outhouse.

12:06.086 --> 12:08.204
I'll be in the car.

12:10.708 --> 12:12.759
Buenas tardes.

12:12.793 --> 12:15.211
PerdÃ³n

12:15.213 --> 12:18.348
Â¿Sabes dÃ³nde es Paloma?

12:18.382 --> 12:20.717
Â¿QuiÃ©n pregunta?

12:20.719 --> 12:22.519
Oh, lo siento.

12:22.553 --> 12:25.471
Me llamas Liza Winter de "the Hill."

12:30.561 --> 12:32.862
Paloma?

12:40.955 --> 12:42.822
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.412
There's been a death.

12:51.131 --> 12:52.465
What's your evacuation plan?

12:52.499 --> 12:54.083
We got a population of 50,000.

12:54.085 --> 12:56.302
I'm not gonna cause pandemonium
over a technical glitch.

12:56.337 --> 12:59.756
You know, we've been here a year managing
this reactor just fine without you people.

12:59.758 --> 13:01.391
It wasn't critical yet.

13:01.425 --> 13:03.059
Something must have
built up in the reactor.

13:03.093 --> 13:04.761
What are the by-products
of the fission reaction?

13:04.763 --> 13:07.063
- That's not my domain.
- Is it yours?

13:07.097 --> 13:08.765
By-products are someone else's job.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.149
- Fine, whose?
- Whose?

13:10.184 --> 13:13.019
- Sinclair.
- Who is Sinclair?

13:13.070 --> 13:14.771
His assistant.

13:14.773 --> 13:16.823
Theodore's last name is Sinclair?

13:16.857 --> 13:17.824
So?

13:17.858 --> 13:20.777
Dr. Theodore Sinclair?

13:20.779 --> 13:23.279
You've got a nuclear
physicist carrying your water?

13:25.282 --> 13:28.451
Dr. Sinclair, we had no
idea you were a physicist.

13:28.502 --> 13:30.003
You're in good company.

13:30.037 --> 13:32.171
- Well, if you'll excuse me.
- What? Where are you going?

13:32.206 --> 13:33.873
Chicago, Anchorage, far away from here.

13:33.924 --> 13:35.291
We need your help.

13:35.293 --> 13:36.960
You geniuses came to save us, right?

13:36.962 --> 13:39.679
You don't need a secretary
to tell you your business.

13:39.713 --> 13:41.965
A secretary who was nominated
for the Forbes Prize.

13:42.016 --> 13:44.300
If I recall, I lost to you.

13:46.220 --> 13:50.139
You can't leave. The core temperature
is nearly at 1,000 degrees.

13:50.141 --> 13:52.525
Why do you think I'm leaving?

13:52.559 --> 13:55.111
So that's it? You're jumping ship?

13:55.145 --> 13:56.779
The last time I tried to help you,

13:56.814 --> 13:58.698
Ellis barred me from the reactor room.

13:58.732 --> 14:01.367
If they're determined to sink,
they can do it without me.

14:01.402 --> 14:05.204
I have no idea why you stayed
here working for that hayseed,

14:05.239 --> 14:07.457
but my guess is you're
proud of that reactor.

14:07.491 --> 14:10.126
You're probably the
only reason it's running.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.912
- It's not.
- Well, it could if you'd help.

14:12.963 --> 14:15.832
You're gonna let a year
of your life melt down?

14:20.137 --> 14:22.005
Let me guess,

14:22.056 --> 14:25.008
something's recapturing neutrons

14:25.059 --> 14:26.392
faster than we can supply them.

14:26.427 --> 14:28.845
And poisoning the reaction.

14:28.896 --> 14:31.064
I warned them about this.

14:32.182 --> 14:33.683
You're looking for an isotope

14:33.734 --> 14:35.985
with a large neutron capture cross section.

14:36.020 --> 14:39.105
At least 2.2 times 10 to the 6th barns.

14:39.156 --> 14:40.907
There's iodine-135.

14:40.941 --> 14:43.443
- 6% of fission by-product.
- And highly unstable.

14:43.494 --> 14:44.827
It could be breaking
down into something else.

14:44.862 --> 14:46.529
Xenon?

14:46.531 --> 14:50.333
135 would have an enormous
neutron absorption cross section.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.919
I've studied the xenon
isotopes. 135 doesn't exist.

14:52.953 --> 14:56.089
Neither did a continuous
nuclear reactor until today.

14:56.123 --> 14:58.875
Sometimes the most crucial
elements in a reaction

14:58.926 --> 15:00.426
are pretty much invisible.

15:00.461 --> 15:03.629
Sometimes they're barely
allowed in the building.

15:11.221 --> 15:13.473
Oh, Paloma.

15:20.447 --> 15:22.865
I'm very sorry for your loss.

15:32.209 --> 15:35.244
Did you know her brother
was in the Pacific?

15:35.295 --> 15:37.380
Did you know she had a brother?

15:39.750 --> 15:42.635
She said that they can't
even give him a proper burial

15:42.669 --> 15:44.921
because the military
didn't send the body back.

15:44.923 --> 15:47.090
They never do.

15:47.092 --> 15:49.842
But it means something different to them.

15:49.893 --> 15:52.812
Their whole religion is based in this land

15:52.846 --> 15:54.263
where their people are buried.

15:54.265 --> 15:56.015
She has a crucifix on her wall.

15:56.066 --> 15:57.850
I think she's Catholic.

15:57.901 --> 15:59.318
Yes, so are we, technically.

15:59.353 --> 16:02.405
Frank, all I'm trying to say is

16:02.439 --> 16:06.442
this whole godforsaken
place is important to them.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.498
Everything all right?

16:14.952 --> 16:17.203
I'll ask him.

16:17.254 --> 16:20.957
She wants to know if you
have your security pass.

16:22.713 --> 16:24.380
It means nothing,

16:24.431 --> 16:25.715
the fact that he didn't tell you.

16:25.766 --> 16:27.266
I'm sure it slipped his brain.

16:27.301 --> 16:30.053
I asked Charlie explicitly.
He said he was alone.

16:30.087 --> 16:32.638
Well, maybe the Blackshirts
wouldn't permit him to tell you.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.223
This is everything you brought?

16:34.274 --> 16:36.893
There's no way I'm going
to Rose Akley's potluck.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.728
I can't face those vultures.

16:38.730 --> 16:42.615
Oh, self-pity is bad for your complexion.

16:42.649 --> 16:45.401
They live for gossip.
They probably knew already

16:45.452 --> 16:49.072
that Charlie was off gallivanting
with Hester Prins before I did.

16:49.074 --> 16:53.459
She's a physicist. She probably
doesn't even own a mirror.

16:53.494 --> 16:55.912
Supposedly she's very fetching.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.581
And you...

16:58.632 --> 17:01.250
you are ravissante.

17:03.887 --> 17:08.257
If your husband prefers
hamburger to filet...

17:09.727 --> 17:11.676
he deserves an empty stomach.

17:13.347 --> 17:15.848
We're gonna enjoy a night to ourselves.

17:15.898 --> 17:18.233
And my husband won't even notice I'm out.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.604
Really?

17:21.606 --> 17:23.656
I've never heard a couple more...

17:23.690 --> 17:25.608
satisfied with one another.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.194
Am I playing to the back of your house?

17:29.997 --> 17:31.914
Oh.

17:31.949 --> 17:35.201
Well, at least my comÃ©die
de vaudeville is convincing.

17:36.670 --> 17:38.121
You're acting?

17:38.123 --> 17:39.372
Mmm.

17:39.423 --> 17:42.091
Only get to the top of
that hill climbing alone.

17:42.126 --> 17:44.010
Oh.

17:44.044 --> 17:46.379
Maybe you can help me.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.266
I don't...

17:50.300 --> 17:52.135
The button.

18:06.316 --> 18:08.117
Nope.

18:08.119 --> 18:09.702
No.

18:09.736 --> 18:11.287
I told you it wouldn't fit.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.790
It's fit for no one but a grandmother.

18:13.824 --> 18:15.575
Toss it in the bin.

18:15.626 --> 18:17.326
You'll borrow something of mine.

18:17.328 --> 18:20.496
Rose Akley won't stand
for anything too risquÃ©.

18:20.547 --> 18:22.131
Oh, we're not going to the potluck.

18:22.166 --> 18:25.968
The pussy is away, let us play.

18:28.173 --> 18:30.206
And leave your wedding ring.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.034
You still haven't told me what you
need with a truck full of day laborers.

18:40.085 --> 18:43.621
I'm afraid that's above your
security clearance, Private.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.044
You have an hour on the clock.

18:50.095 --> 18:51.929
60 minutes and then I'm rounding them up.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.185
Attention, please.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.220
All vehicles entering...

19:01.440 --> 19:03.057
... for security purposes.

19:03.108 --> 19:06.310
You want me to add more fuel
to a reactor that's already hot?

19:06.361 --> 19:08.729
Taking fuel out is what
caused the temperature to rise.

19:10.365 --> 19:13.034
So you believe that this'll
get rid of the neutron problem?

19:13.068 --> 19:15.319
Your secretary believes it

19:15.370 --> 19:17.872
and I believe your secretary.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.824
- How long will it take?
- 100 slugs?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.542
My guys will be loading till morning.

19:21.577 --> 19:25.163
Enjoy the honeymoon suite.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.309
I think their sacred land
is just over that hill.

19:40.312 --> 19:43.514
Excuse me. So the shrine is over there?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.899
But you'll have to wait here.

19:44.901 --> 19:47.235
- We won't be long.
- They...

19:47.237 --> 19:48.753
they wanted me to stay with you.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.023
You don't have the authority
to witness the releasing rite.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.544
Thank you for your help.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.881
Every soldier deserves a proper funeral.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.884
Do you know Robert Frost, Professor?

20:19.886 --> 20:22.220
My wife reads it.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.555
"Before I built a wall,

20:24.557 --> 20:28.059
I'd ask to know what I was
walling in or walling out

20:28.061 --> 20:31.729
and to whom I was like to give offense."

20:31.731 --> 20:34.899
They say good fences make good neighbors.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.202
Maybe I just never met the right fence?

21:41.915 --> 21:45.167
They don't listen to Negro music
at the Brooklyn Country Club?

21:45.201 --> 21:48.420
Brookline. I don't think we belong here.

21:48.455 --> 21:49.672
You're not a possession.

21:49.706 --> 21:52.257
You don't belong one place or another.

21:54.627 --> 21:56.628
Isn't it fun?

22:03.887 --> 22:05.604
Oh.

22:13.563 --> 22:15.564
Couple beers for you ladies?

22:15.566 --> 22:17.533
Have you got anything harder?

22:18.985 --> 22:20.869
- Still's cooking a little 80 proof.
- Ooh!

22:20.904 --> 22:23.038
Might scare you some up
if you save me a dance.

22:24.407 --> 22:26.325
Sorry, it's very loud in here.

22:26.376 --> 22:28.877
She's Anne. I'm Diane.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.629
We're WACs.

22:30.663 --> 22:33.382
Just transferred to the Hill.

22:44.844 --> 22:46.645
This could be my last drink.

22:46.679 --> 22:48.447
Relax.

22:48.449 --> 22:50.699
Theodore was right about the xenon-135.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.284
The temperature is coming down.

22:54.037 --> 22:56.288
All these people, two neutrons away

22:56.339 --> 22:58.123
from kingdom come and
they don't even know it.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.792
You're being melodramatic, you know that?

22:59.794 --> 23:01.894
The workers will cool down
the pile and we'll try again.

23:01.928 --> 23:04.263
We could go AWOL. Go home.

23:04.297 --> 23:06.632
We can't fly back to the Hill
until the reactor is online.

23:06.634 --> 23:09.301
I wasn't talking about the Hill.

23:14.941 --> 23:18.143
So, I know you're not from Missouri.

23:19.813 --> 23:22.398
Your family still in Holland?

23:22.449 --> 23:24.650
My mother, she's buried there.

23:24.652 --> 23:27.319
My father fled to London.

23:27.321 --> 23:29.371
Hates the food.

23:29.406 --> 23:32.024
End of story. Yours?

23:33.543 --> 23:35.411
Mom's in St. Louis.

23:35.462 --> 23:39.164
Dad's in Jefferson City.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.719
Inmate 7297

23:43.753 --> 23:46.839
at the state penitentiary
last time I checked.

23:53.713 --> 23:55.581
Why am I telling you that?

23:57.317 --> 23:59.652
My wife doesn't even know.

24:06.443 --> 24:10.112
What are the odds that we charbroil
the state of Tennessee tonight?

24:10.163 --> 24:11.947
We're just cogs in the machine.

24:13.950 --> 24:16.118
But say you're Oppenheimer.

24:16.169 --> 24:20.706
You have power to redraw the
map of civilization forever.

24:21.708 --> 24:23.759
Or put a match to it.

24:34.688 --> 24:37.356
I found out I was pregnant last year.

24:39.059 --> 24:42.061
Classics professor at Princeton.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.897
Wanted to marry me. Two weeks later,

24:44.899 --> 24:47.066
Frank asks if I want to become

24:47.068 --> 24:49.952
the only female physicist at Los Alamos.

24:49.986 --> 24:52.037
Classics wouldn't come,

24:52.072 --> 24:54.873
so I laid down on a metal table

24:54.908 --> 24:56.742
in a duplex in Teaneck.

25:01.047 --> 25:04.166
That must have been a complicated choice.

25:04.217 --> 25:07.503
When the war is over, you'll
get tenure wherever you want.

25:07.554 --> 25:09.588
Even Theodore.

25:09.639 --> 25:11.090
He'll be fine.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.176
Academia chooses a black
man over a woman every time.

25:16.463 --> 25:21.266
I'll fight to get an adjunct
job at Podunk Junior College.

25:21.268 --> 25:23.018
But I don't give a shit.

25:23.069 --> 25:26.905
Because for however long the war lasts...

25:28.191 --> 25:30.075
I get to do what I love.

25:39.285 --> 25:41.003
If I were Oppie...

25:43.256 --> 25:45.290
I'd wait for a year from now

25:45.292 --> 25:48.343
to become the world's
most famous scientist.

25:48.378 --> 25:51.797
I'd pose for "Life" magazine.

25:51.831 --> 25:54.533
And then I'd run for office.

26:02.525 --> 26:04.810
To President Prins.

26:08.314 --> 26:11.733
It's unlucky to toast with water.

26:11.785 --> 26:14.536
We'll have to go to my room.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.468
Oh, getting a little close.

26:29.502 --> 26:31.670
Oh.

26:39.729 --> 26:41.013
Here you go.

26:41.064 --> 26:43.849
Cooked up special just for you. 90 proof.

26:43.851 --> 26:46.101
That's 80 proof too much for me.

26:46.152 --> 26:48.187
Aw, thought you were an army girl.

27:29.145 --> 27:31.780
So, I say...

27:31.814 --> 27:33.398
I tell Frank

27:33.400 --> 27:35.284
it'll never work with a hollow sphere.

27:35.318 --> 27:36.618
Never.

27:36.653 --> 27:38.620
He says to me,

27:38.655 --> 27:41.240
well, if the Wrong
Brothers can fly a plane...

27:41.291 --> 27:42.875
The Wright brothers.

27:42.909 --> 27:44.576
- What?
- The Wright brothers.

27:46.496 --> 27:48.413
You said the Wrong brothers.

27:51.918 --> 27:53.669
I was wrong about the Wright?

27:56.923 --> 27:59.258
Never in a million years
would I have thought

27:59.309 --> 28:02.177
that something with a density of 19.5 grams

28:02.228 --> 28:04.596
per cubic centimeter would compress.

28:04.647 --> 28:07.766
I mean, you can't blow in a can of beer

28:07.817 --> 28:10.769
without spattering some beer, right?

28:14.357 --> 28:16.408
Speaking of which,

28:16.442 --> 28:18.860
what's a girl got to do
to get a drink around here?

28:32.125 --> 28:33.342
Oops.

28:46.973 --> 28:49.141
Late night selling cookies?

28:51.811 --> 28:55.314
We had rehearsal for this
stupid campout tomorrow.

28:56.366 --> 28:58.483
We have to serenade the soldiers.

28:58.534 --> 29:01.320
Well, you have a very nice singing voice.

29:03.039 --> 29:04.740
I look like Shirley Temple.

29:08.711 --> 29:10.662
I'm not a child.

29:10.664 --> 29:13.415
Please don't make me do this anymore.

29:15.168 --> 29:18.337
I'm afraid your mother's
calling the plays on this one.

29:19.806 --> 29:22.307
It's your fault we're
here in the first place.

29:33.353 --> 29:35.520
Hey.

29:35.522 --> 29:37.739
What are we looking at?

29:39.025 --> 29:41.526
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

29:43.279 --> 29:45.614
Taurus.

29:45.665 --> 29:48.834
You remember how Taurus
looked from New Jersey?

29:50.336 --> 29:53.255
You could barely even see Electra.

29:53.289 --> 29:55.707
Look. Look how bright that is.

30:02.765 --> 30:05.634
This isn't our home, Callie.

30:06.936 --> 30:09.855
This whole neighborhood,

30:09.889 --> 30:12.140
it's just cheap plaster and wood.

30:12.191 --> 30:15.060
In a couple years, we
will be back in Princeton.

30:15.062 --> 30:17.696
And this,

30:17.730 --> 30:19.981
this'll all be Indian land.

30:23.319 --> 30:25.404
Like it never happened.

30:29.575 --> 30:31.576
We just got to get through it.

30:33.796 --> 30:35.914
Any way we can.

30:55.935 --> 30:58.236
We should use this yard more.

31:03.910 --> 31:05.527
What?

31:28.935 --> 31:30.852
Ooh.

31:30.887 --> 31:32.804
Ooh.

31:32.855 --> 31:35.023
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Ow.

31:35.057 --> 31:36.975
- Come on.
- No.

31:37.026 --> 31:38.477
Abby.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.779
- We're just fine here.
- Abby, come on.

31:40.813 --> 31:42.114
- Don't worry about it.
- We're going home.

31:42.148 --> 31:44.816
- No, I want to dance.
- What did you give her?

31:47.370 --> 31:49.955
I'm... I'm having...

32:04.886 --> 32:07.137
Hate to interrupt you and the missus.

32:13.478 --> 32:16.596
We filled every channel,
overpowered the xenon,

32:16.598 --> 32:18.982
temperature's constant now.

32:19.016 --> 32:21.601
Army says go.

32:21.603 --> 32:24.104
You're still not gonna do...

32:24.106 --> 32:28.608
make any changes to safety
before you light her up?

32:31.412 --> 32:32.913
Are you drunk?

32:34.949 --> 32:36.867
Not nearly enough for this.

32:38.953 --> 32:40.704
Go ahead.

32:45.376 --> 32:47.461
We were having fun.

32:47.512 --> 32:49.346
Too much.

32:49.380 --> 32:50.847
Too much fun for one night.

32:50.882 --> 32:53.300
I want to dance, El. Why
won't you dance with me?

32:53.302 --> 32:55.519
Dance?

33:02.977 --> 33:04.478
Okay.

33:19.744 --> 33:23.380
Primary cooling system team
leader reports status green.

33:23.414 --> 33:26.750
Air valves 10 to 24 report all green.

33:26.801 --> 33:28.585
Status normal.

33:28.587 --> 33:30.921
All primary pumps report green.

33:30.972 --> 33:33.423
Standing by.

33:33.424 --> 33:35.592
I thought you weren't
supposed to be in here.

33:35.626 --> 33:37.594
They told me I could come back

33:37.628 --> 33:38.962
if I stick to my own business

33:38.964 --> 33:41.465
and respect my superiors.

33:41.516 --> 33:43.216
I assume you're responsible?

33:45.303 --> 33:47.053
The least we could do.

33:49.056 --> 33:51.057
Your friend asked why I stay here.

33:52.143 --> 33:54.278
This is as close as I can
get to wherever you people

33:54.312 --> 33:56.563
are building what we
both know you're building.

33:57.782 --> 34:00.067
I wish I could...

34:00.069 --> 34:01.485
talk about it.

34:01.536 --> 34:03.570
I can't get this past the censors.

34:03.572 --> 34:05.739
But you can deliver it to Frank Winter.

34:05.773 --> 34:07.874
I know his neutron reaction work.

34:07.909 --> 34:09.793
He should see mine.

34:09.827 --> 34:11.245
If he found a way to get a woman there,

34:11.246 --> 34:13.045
he can find a way to get me.

34:13.081 --> 34:15.047
No offense.

34:17.552 --> 34:20.387
A rising tide lifts all boats.

34:21.656 --> 34:23.724
Attention, all plant personnel

34:23.757 --> 34:25.926
are required to pass
through the safety zone

34:25.976 --> 34:29.096
prior to leaving the facility.

34:48.533 --> 34:50.500
Mrs. Abby?

34:51.835 --> 34:54.036
I'm gonna make a sandwich for Joey.

34:54.088 --> 34:55.706
Are you hungry?

34:55.757 --> 34:57.674
What time is it?

34:57.709 --> 34:59.126
It's 12:00.

35:00.962 --> 35:04.014
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

35:04.048 --> 35:05.966
Okay.

35:24.652 --> 35:26.987
Are you intentionally hitting every bump?

35:28.873 --> 35:31.425
What's that noise?

35:31.459 --> 35:32.993
What the hell?

35:34.746 --> 35:36.496
- What are you doing?
- It's not me.

35:36.547 --> 35:38.131
Something's wrong with the car.

35:40.468 --> 35:42.469
Damn it.

35:50.762 --> 35:52.679
Brand-new car.

35:52.681 --> 35:55.399
Hasn't even needed an oil change.

36:00.071 --> 36:02.522
Christ, fuel line is full of water.

36:03.858 --> 36:06.743
Son of a bitch at the station
must have diluted the gas.

36:06.778 --> 36:09.996
Even a Cadillac won't
run if the fuel's no good.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.251
Reactor fuel.

36:14.285 --> 36:16.536
Nuclear cars?

36:16.538 --> 36:18.255
Wouldn't file a patent just yet.

36:18.289 --> 36:21.091
We've been designing a
bomb based on plutonium

36:21.125 --> 36:23.210
two geniuses cranked out with a cyclotron.

36:23.261 --> 36:24.628
So?

36:24.679 --> 36:26.797
So a reactor is different. Iodine, xenon,

36:26.848 --> 36:29.015
who knows what else? Chemical by-products.

36:29.050 --> 36:30.600
Water in the gas.

36:33.137 --> 36:35.305
What if reactor plutonium isn't pure?

36:35.356 --> 36:37.274
Frank always assumes the worst.

36:37.308 --> 36:39.693
Implosion model could run on crude oil.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.390
âª He's got my brothers and my sisters âª

36:53.392 --> 36:55.059
âª In His hands âª

36:55.061 --> 36:57.228
âª He's got my brothers and my sisters âª

36:57.230 --> 36:58.779
âª In His hands âª

36:58.814 --> 37:00.898
âª He's got my brothers and my sisters âª

37:00.900 --> 37:02.399
âª In His hands âª

37:02.401 --> 37:05.202
âª He's got the whole
world in His hands âª

37:05.237 --> 37:07.955
âª He's got the sun and the rain âª

37:07.989 --> 37:09.373
âª In His hands âª

37:09.407 --> 37:11.709
âª He's got the moon and the stars âª

37:11.743 --> 37:13.244
âª In His hands âª

37:13.246 --> 37:14.879
âª He's got the wind and the clouds âª

37:14.913 --> 37:16.714
âª In His hands âª

37:16.748 --> 37:18.749
âª He's got the ocean and the seas âª

37:18.800 --> 37:20.251
âª In His hands âª

37:20.302 --> 37:22.253
âª He's got you and He's got me... âª

37:28.793 --> 37:31.428
I saw you hanging around our house.

37:33.398 --> 37:35.983
I'm on night patrol. We're supposed to...

37:36.017 --> 37:38.352
keep the neighborhood safe.

37:38.403 --> 37:42.106
Was there a lot of suspicious
activity around my bedroom window?

37:45.076 --> 37:46.777
Are you a Peeping Tom or something?

37:48.613 --> 37:50.331
Well, you flashed me.

37:52.334 --> 37:54.084
Well, now it's your turn.

37:55.787 --> 37:57.454
What?

37:57.505 --> 37:59.790
Show me what's under your shirt...

38:01.543 --> 38:03.260
or I'll scream.

39:02.724 --> 39:05.342
- Paloma, I...
- Buena suerte.

39:21.209 --> 39:22.943
Everything okay?

39:25.497 --> 39:27.781
Well, she quit.

39:27.816 --> 39:30.918
She said that...

39:30.952 --> 39:35.622
after yesterday, she wasn't
comfortable working for us anymore.

39:38.426 --> 39:40.794
What did you say?

39:40.829 --> 39:44.264
I told her vaya con Dios

39:44.299 --> 39:45.799
and I gave her 20 bucks.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.720
What was I supposed to say?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.609
Well, I'm sure we can get a replacement.

39:57.479 --> 39:59.897
We never needed a maid in Princeton.

40:09.207 --> 40:11.458
He wanted to kidnap the princess.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.827
So Zeus disguised himself

40:13.878 --> 40:15.996
as a giant white bull, Taurus,

40:15.998 --> 40:19.716
and he carried her on his
back across the ocean to Crete

40:19.751 --> 40:22.336
where he raped her, basically.

40:22.338 --> 40:25.055
And she never saw her family again.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.344
How do you know so much?

40:30.346 --> 40:33.680
We had a telescope in Princeton.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.102
Where is that?

40:38.153 --> 40:40.404
It's where I'm from.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.190
Where I'm going back to.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.078
Not too soon, I hope.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.771
Thanks for the ride.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.391
Sure.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.696
So, what happens now?

41:24.449 --> 41:27.234
We go back to being sworn enemies?

41:34.742 --> 41:36.460
Hair of the dog?

41:36.494 --> 41:39.079
I got two bottles of whiskey

41:39.130 --> 41:41.331
burning a hole in my suitcase.

41:48.256 --> 41:50.140
No.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.458
Thank you.

41:54.462 --> 41:56.930
- See you around.
- Yeah.

42:16.618 --> 42:19.002
Well, well, well.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.787
I'd give you a hero's welcome,

42:20.789 --> 42:23.957
but as you can see, I have my hands full
with this pile of work you left behind.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.093
Is Frank here?

42:27.128 --> 42:28.378
Hardly.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.380
No. No, it's just me.

42:55.373 --> 42:58.242
As long as we're both
stranded here in the desert,

42:58.293 --> 43:00.327
how about a drop to drink?

43:11.339 --> 43:14.258
Or we could skip the drink.

43:31.276 --> 43:34.828
Hi.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.749
How was wherever you were?

43:41.119 --> 43:42.669
Not home.

43:52.548 --> 43:55.215
I love you, Abby.

44:03.775 --> 44:08.862
Oh, wow.

44:15.453 --> 44:18.121
I have to go back to the office.

44:20.708 --> 44:24.578
Now? What's wrong?

44:27.915 --> 44:29.750
I don't know yet.
