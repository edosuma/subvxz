Ooh...

(men shouting)

00:06.370 --> 00:08.203
What you call sanity...

00:08.239 --> 00:09.705
Hey!

00:09.741 --> 00:11.073
...is just a prison in your mind.

00:11.142 --> 00:12.441
(laughing) Bang.

00:12.476 --> 00:13.742
(laughter)

00:13.778 --> 00:14.843
Wake up!

00:16.680 --> 00:18.447
(grunting)

00:18.482 --> 00:20.048
You're the one who's been following us.

00:20.084 --> 00:21.717
Do you know her?

00:21.752 --> 00:23.252
That's my mom.

00:24.955 --> 00:26.489
Isabella's death has altered things,

00:26.524 --> 00:27.757
- and I can't continue.
- No!

00:27.792 --> 00:29.792
Ed, I will not let you leave.

00:31.968 --> 00:33.768
I don't want to kill him.

00:33.804 --> 00:37.172
I want to destroy him.

00:37.207 --> 00:39.741
GORDON: <i>Tetch infected him
that night in the hospital.</i>

00:39.777 --> 00:41.297
Swear that you'll bring him in alive.

00:41.622 --> 00:42.634
I swear.

THOMPKINS: <i>After the wedding,</i>

<i>Mario and I are leaving Gotham.</i>

<i>I'll never see you again.</i>

00:48.902 --> 00:50.702
Lee, you cannot marry him.

00:50.737 --> 00:51.836

What the hell are you doing here?

01:44.683 --> 01:47.083
If Falcone sees you, God
only knows what he'll do.

01:47.129 --> 01:49.095
I had to do it, Harv.

01:50.353 --> 01:52.219
He was infected. He would've killed her.

01:52.255 --> 01:53.320
It was a legit kill.

01:53.356 --> 01:54.655
That's the law.

01:54.690 --> 01:57.057
This is family.

01:57.093 --> 01:58.392
The man's burying his son.

01:58.427 --> 01:59.960
Lee's burying a husband.

01:59.996 --> 02:02.997
I wanted to... (exhales)

02:05.201 --> 02:06.333
I don't know.

02:06.369 --> 02:07.534
To what?

02:07.570 --> 02:09.336
Say sorry?

02:09.372 --> 02:11.639
Talk about the past?

02:13.109 --> 02:15.075
This isn't the time or the place.
Come on.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.316
(mourners sobbing)

02:38.067 --> 02:39.700
(buttons beeping)

02:39.735 --> 02:41.235
(line ringing)

02:41.270 --> 02:42.670
(on phone): This is Edward.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.271
Leave a message.

02:44.307 --> 02:46.607
Or don't.

02:46.642 --> 02:48.342
Doesn't really matter.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.677
(voice mail beeps)

02:49.712 --> 02:51.345
- Hey! Ooh.
- What?

02:51.380 --> 02:53.646
Mayor, the press have assembled
in the conference room.

02:53.647 --> 02:55.880
- They are requesting your presence.
- The press? Why?

02:55.951 --> 02:57.618
The latest figures are in.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.320
Fine.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.724
Let the vultures have at me.

03:03.759 --> 03:04.792
(indistinct chatter)

03:04.827 --> 03:06.026
MAN: Hey, there he is.

03:06.062 --> 03:08.262
(applause, clamoring)

03:11.067 --> 03:13.267
They're through the
roof across the board.

03:13.302 --> 03:15.569
Yeah, jobs are up, market's up.

03:15.604 --> 03:17.137
Crime way, way down.

03:17.173 --> 03:19.373
You did it.

03:20.643 --> 03:22.910
Enjoy the moment, sir.

03:22.945 --> 03:25.212
Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.

03:27.817 --> 03:30.918
Praise well deserved, Mr. Mayor.

03:30.953 --> 03:33.454
I really think we need to
cash in on this good news

03:33.489 --> 03:35.422
immediately.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.725
You are a clever fellow, Tarquin, but...

03:37.760 --> 03:39.059
I wish Ed were here.

03:39.095 --> 03:40.627
TARQUIN: My sole job as deputy chief

03:40.663 --> 03:42.730
of staff is to serve
you with the exact same

03:42.765 --> 03:45.866
zeal and smarts as Mr. Nygma would.

03:45.901 --> 03:48.202
Thank you all so much for coming.

03:48.237 --> 03:49.436
Thanks, everyone.

03:49.472 --> 03:50.871
Bob, great to see you.

03:50.906 --> 03:52.506
Bill, take care.

03:52.541 --> 03:54.775
(indistinct chatter)

03:54.810 --> 03:57.678
Margaret Hearst. Know her?

03:57.713 --> 04:00.180
Of course.

04:00.216 --> 04:02.383
When I saw these numbers
come in, I thought who better

04:02.418 --> 04:05.686
to help us capitalize on
this than Margaret Hearst?

04:05.721 --> 04:08.455
The whole city... no, the whole
country... watches her show.

04:08.491 --> 04:10.024
She can take you to a whole new level.

04:10.059 --> 04:12.426
Solidify your legacy
on a national scale.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.529
"National scale"?

04:15.564 --> 04:17.297
She's in my office,

04:17.333 --> 04:19.366
and she is dying to meet you.

04:19.402 --> 04:21.168
Turn her down now, she won't come back,

04:21.202 --> 04:23.170
like... ever.

04:23.205 --> 04:25.105
What do you say?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.644
How's my hair?

04:39.989 --> 04:41.989
(clanging nearby)

04:50.433 --> 04:53.667
(glugging)

04:53.702 --> 04:56.236
Hope you don't mind.

04:56.272 --> 04:57.638
I helped myself.

04:57.773 --> 04:58.871
What do you want?

04:58.872 --> 04:59.970
I'm here

04:59.971 --> 05:02.171
as a messenger.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.911
Okay, I'm listening.

05:03.946 --> 05:06.780
You messed up, Jim.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.348
Killed the don's son.

05:08.384 --> 05:10.017
He's beside himself.

05:10.052 --> 05:11.551
I've never seen him like this before.

05:12.555 --> 05:13.619
I want to speak to him.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.453
Oh, no, we're way past that.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.725
It's only a matter of time
before he gives the nod to...

05:17.760 --> 05:18.859
(clucks tongue)

05:18.894 --> 05:20.194
...put a bullet in your head.

05:20.229 --> 05:21.495
You could try.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.898
I don't... try.

05:24.934 --> 05:28.435
And I never stop.

05:28.471 --> 05:30.237
You won't see me coming.

05:30.272 --> 05:32.439
And you won't feel a thing.

05:33.876 --> 05:36.043
If we don't get a chance
to talk before then,

05:36.078 --> 05:38.545
it's been really nice knowing you.

05:38.581 --> 05:40.114
You're a good egg.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.284
Also...

05:44.320 --> 05:46.053
nice shot on Mario.

05:46.088 --> 05:47.788
I never liked him.

05:53.429 --> 05:55.395
♪ ♪

06:05.841 --> 06:07.041
Nice place.

06:11.347 --> 06:12.713
What's with the raggedy clothes?

06:12.748 --> 06:15.249
Why are you back?

06:17.520 --> 06:19.586
To see you, of course.

06:20.890 --> 06:22.990
(quietly scoffs)

06:23.025 --> 06:24.591
Why now?

06:24.660 --> 06:28.829
Why wait 11 years to see me?

06:28.864 --> 06:30.464
That's right.

06:30.499 --> 06:32.499
11 years.

06:33.802 --> 06:36.003
You didn't even check up on me.

06:37.206 --> 06:38.805
What can I say?

06:38.841 --> 06:41.275
I'm sorry, and you have no idea

06:41.310 --> 06:43.677
how many times I thought of you.

06:43.712 --> 06:45.112
How many times, Mom?

06:45.147 --> 06:46.280
I had to leave.

06:46.348 --> 06:48.448
I had no choice.

06:51.020 --> 06:53.987
You know that orphanage I left you at?

06:54.023 --> 06:57.691
It's the same one I was
left at by who knows who.

06:57.726 --> 06:59.326
St. Maria's.

06:59.361 --> 07:01.028
It's where I got my name.

07:01.063 --> 07:05.299
I grew up there and on the streets.

07:05.334 --> 07:07.634
It was on the streets that I had you.

07:07.670 --> 07:08.835
Who's my father?

07:08.871 --> 07:11.638
You're not dating that kid, are you?

07:13.976 --> 07:15.108
(sighs)

07:15.144 --> 07:16.310
You should go.

07:16.345 --> 07:18.212
Wait, I me... I was a dumb kid, okay?

07:18.247 --> 07:19.513
I got in trouble with the law.

07:19.548 --> 07:21.614
I had to leave or they were
gonna take me to prison.

07:21.615 --> 07:22.913
I had to run and run fast.

07:22.914 --> 07:24.712
And you can't run fast
with a five-year-old.

07:24.713 --> 07:26.646
Not just a five-year-old.

07:26.689 --> 07:30.123
Your five-year-old.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.326
Your daughter.

07:32.361 --> 07:34.661
That was a bad call.

07:34.730 --> 07:36.496
Okay?

07:36.532 --> 07:41.201
I just wanted to come here,
and tell you that I love you.

07:41.237 --> 07:44.404
And I'm sorry.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.706
All righty then.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.976
This has been so fun.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.277
Bye.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.347
Selina.

07:53.382 --> 07:54.548
Good-bye.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.860
(sighs)

08:11.331 --> 08:13.632
Mayor, this...

08:14.025 --> 08:15.258
is Ms. Hearst.

08:15.293 --> 08:16.526
Perhaps you've truly found

08:16.561 --> 08:18.495
your calling in office, Mr. Cobblepot.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.148
Or perhaps...

08:21.183 --> 08:23.817
you just know how to show people
only what they want to see.

08:23.196 --> 08:24.295
Hmm?

08:24.330 --> 08:26.230
Either way, I plan

08:26.265 --> 08:28.566
to get inside your head
and share what I find

08:28.601 --> 08:30.134
with the citizens of Gotham.

08:30.169 --> 08:31.302
Does that deter you?

08:32.738 --> 08:33.871
Please.

08:33.940 --> 08:34.971
Then I think

08:34.972 --> 08:36.470
the exclusive interview should happen

08:36.471 --> 08:37.535
here at City Hall

08:37.537 --> 08:39.236
this Friday, live.

08:39.312 --> 08:41.645
Actually, I would prefer
to do it at home and...

08:41.681 --> 08:42.813
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

08:42.849 --> 08:45.149
This Friday or not at all.

08:45.184 --> 08:49.019
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor.

08:49.055 --> 08:52.089
I'm not a fan.

08:52.124 --> 08:55.092
I shan't be holding back.

08:55.127 --> 08:57.795
My audience expects the
truth and I give it to them.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.430
The truth is in my numbers,

08:59.465 --> 09:00.798
Ms. Hearst.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.467
Then Friday it is.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.369
Gotham will see their mayor...

09:05.938 --> 09:07.037
as he truly is.

09:09.342 --> 09:10.507
Dig deep.

09:10.543 --> 09:13.110
I have nothing to hide.

09:28.861 --> 09:31.128
LUCIUS: Melanie Blake.

09:31.163 --> 09:32.630
Found wandering the train tracks

09:32.665 --> 09:34.698
late last night in a state of undress.

09:34.734 --> 09:36.233
She collapsed soon after,

09:36.269 --> 09:38.369
and died in the ambulance
of coronary failure.

09:38.404 --> 09:41.171
At some point prior to her
appearance on the tracks,

09:41.207 --> 09:45.276
somebody applied a strong
electrical current to her.

09:45.311 --> 09:46.777
Considering the extent of the burns,

09:46.812 --> 09:48.012
I'm guessing literally

09:48.047 --> 09:50.414
thousands of volts were passed

09:50.550 --> 09:51.749
through this poor girl.

09:51.784 --> 09:52.883
Torture?

09:52.919 --> 09:54.084
Perhaps.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.920
She say anything before she die?

09:55.955 --> 09:57.354
No.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.822
GORDON: She was...

09:58.858 --> 10:00.925
stabbed as well?

10:00.960 --> 10:03.461
Melanie was stabbed three
days ago by her boyfriend.

10:03.796 --> 10:05.396
She was pronounced
dead in the ambulance.

10:05.431 --> 10:06.664
Wait, w-what?

10:06.699 --> 10:07.798
Two days ago,

10:07.833 --> 10:09.600
this girl was taken to the morgue,

10:09.635 --> 10:10.935
dead.

10:10.970 --> 10:12.236
BULLOCK: And yet last night,

10:12.271 --> 10:14.537
she's walking down the train
tracks after getting zapped

10:14.538 --> 10:16.471
with 10,000 volts in her noggin?

10:16.472 --> 10:18.138
Doesn't anyone die in Gotham anymore?

10:18.144 --> 10:20.377
Is it possible she wasn't actually dead,

10:20.413 --> 10:22.379
and just walked out of the morgue?

10:22.415 --> 10:24.715
These days I no longer say impossible.

10:24.750 --> 10:25.916
Unlikely.

10:26.986 --> 10:28.118
The morgue.

10:28.154 --> 10:30.354
It's not a morgue, it's a motel.

10:33.793 --> 10:36.560
Harvey!

10:36.595 --> 10:39.596
As acting captain, I
demand that you arrest

10:39.632 --> 10:42.466
Detective Gordon for
the murder of my husband.

10:42.501 --> 10:43.734
Lee...

10:43.769 --> 10:45.669
please.

10:45.705 --> 10:47.738
Please?

10:47.773 --> 10:49.039
Please...

10:49.075 --> 10:51.208
what?!

10:51.243 --> 10:52.910
You didn't have to kill him.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.245
Dr. Thompkins, if I may,

10:54.280 --> 10:55.746
your husband took a drug that...

10:55.781 --> 10:57.214
Nathaniel Barnes was infected

10:57.249 --> 10:59.149
with the same virus.

10:59.185 --> 11:00.718
He's alive.

11:00.753 --> 11:03.053
Jim spared <i> his</i> life.

11:09.428 --> 11:12.329
And yet he gunned down
Mario on his wedding day.

11:20.873 --> 11:24.408
You're the real virus, Jim.

11:24.443 --> 11:28.145
You seep into people's lives

11:28.180 --> 11:29.646

13:00.272 --> 13:02.039
Sorry to bother you so late, Mr. Mayor.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.908
Yes. What is it?

13:04.944 --> 13:07.211
Someone broke into
the cemetery and dug up

13:07.246 --> 13:09.213
your father's remains.

13:26.555 --> 13:29.022
Pollard?

13:29.063 --> 13:31.597
Dwight, please, that's
correct. Something wrong?

13:31.633 --> 13:34.233
Only if you call dead people
walking out of here wrong.

13:34.269 --> 13:35.935

13:35.970 --> 13:37.102

13:37.103 --> 13:39.767

- Yeah.

13:50.818 --> 13:52.652

13:55.189 --> 13:56.656
dead, again.

13:56.691 --> 13:58.591

13:58.626 --> 14:01.460
You have any security
cameras here? Guards?

14:01.496 --> 14:02.661
No, we don't need them.

14:02.697 --> 14:03.995
Nothing ever happens down here.

Why is it so important
to the Court of Owls?

14:32.894 --> 14:35.428
It's just an ornament.

14:35.463 --> 14:37.029
I don't know.

14:37.065 --> 14:38.331
Men died protecting it.

14:38.366 --> 14:39.733
So we hide it,

14:39.768 --> 14:42.068
hold onto it for leverage in
case they come for us again.

14:42.103 --> 14:44.037
Perhaps in the cave. (knocking)

15:08.629 --> 15:10.329
Ms. Kyle.

15:11.866 --> 15:14.734
What a surprise.

15:14.769 --> 15:16.802
For what do we owe this pleasure?

15:16.838 --> 15:19.171
I was just leaving this here for Selina.

15:20.274 --> 15:21.741
Oh.

15:21.776 --> 15:23.542
Uh... come in.

15:25.780 --> 15:27.713

We've been meaning to thank you
in person for the other night.

15:30.618 --> 15:31.951
I can't. I have a train to catch.

15:31.987 --> 15:33.586
Please just see that she gets this.

15:33.621 --> 15:34.953
ALFRED: Would you mind if I asked

15:34.989 --> 15:36.422
what's in the box?

15:37.959 --> 15:41.560
Some things I kept from
my time here in Gotham.

15:41.596 --> 15:43.996
It's not something you'd like
to give to Selina yourself?

15:44.032 --> 15:45.531
I tried reaching out to her.

15:45.566 --> 15:47.533
She's too angry.

15:47.568 --> 15:49.535
Not that I can blame her.

15:49.570 --> 15:51.003
Please, just...

Let me talk to her.

16:25.422 --> 16:26.722
Okay, thanks.

This keeps getting better and better.

16:29.059 --> 16:31.793
Guess where Dwight Pollard
worked before the morgue.

16:31.829 --> 16:33.161
Indian Hill.

16:33.197 --> 16:34.229
How'd you know?

16:34.265 --> 16:35.731
Where else in Gotham do the dead

16:35.766 --> 16:37.165
get brought back to life?

16:41.539 --> 16:42.905
The cops came by, idiot.

16:42.940 --> 16:43.972
How'd she get out?

16:44.008 --> 16:45.040
Never mind.

16:45.075 --> 16:46.275
I have to get to the venue.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.276
I'll come by after.

16:47.311 --> 16:48.677
Should we grab him now?

16:48.712 --> 16:50.913
No, I want to see where he's going.

16:52.783 --> 16:56.218
THOMPKINS: The autopsy showed
that Mario did have the virus.

16:56.253 --> 16:58.921
Mario was my son.

16:58.956 --> 17:03.225
Whether he was sick or
not is of no concern to me.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.460
Gordon took his life.

17:05.496 --> 17:07.396
What are you gonna do?

17:08.832 --> 17:11.032
I cared for Jim Gordon.

17:11.068 --> 17:14.403
In some ways, he was more
like my son than Mario.

17:14.438 --> 17:16.538
His life is mine to take.

17:16.574 --> 17:18.941
That's the natural law.

17:18.976 --> 17:21.710
Blood for blood.

17:21.744 --> 17:25.047
I hate him.

17:25.082 --> 17:27.115
God, I hate him.

17:27.151 --> 17:29.818
Everything bad that's
happened in my life

17:29.853 --> 17:31.386
has happened because of him.

17:31.422 --> 17:33.388
If Gordon dies,

17:33.424 --> 17:36.592
it's a weight we'll both have to carry.

17:36.627 --> 17:38.594
I'm used to such burdens.

17:38.629 --> 17:41.730
You're not.

17:41.765 --> 17:43.599
He'll die by my hand, not yours.

17:45.202 --> 17:47.469
But this is something
you'll need to live with.

17:49.139 --> 17:51.173

18:31.085 --> 18:33.452
I can't imagine all you must be feeling.

18:35.222 --> 18:36.788
She left me here, Bruce.

Well, I can tell you this.

26:37.046 --> 26:39.246
I've never felt better in my life.

26:39.281 --> 26:41.381
Clearer, stronger.

26:41.417 --> 26:43.583
More focused.

26:43.619 --> 26:45.419
Even now, I can feel it

26:45.454 --> 26:48.355
coursing through my veins.

26:48.390 --> 26:50.223
Restoring my body.

26:51.660 --> 26:54.528
So, Mario could've lived

26:54.563 --> 26:56.563
a normal life with it.

26:56.599 --> 26:58.198
Would've given us time to find a cure.

26:58.233 --> 26:59.533
Jim didn't have to kill him.

26:59.568 --> 27:01.435
Cure?

27:01.470 --> 27:03.537
This virus isn't the disease.

27:03.572 --> 27:06.273
It's the antidote.

27:06.341 --> 27:09.109
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

27:09.144 --> 27:11.445
I don't need a cure.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.280
The murderers,

27:13.315 --> 27:15.282
thieves, rapists.

27:17.252 --> 27:19.619
(laughs)

27:19.655 --> 27:22.456
James Gordon is one of them.

27:22.491 --> 27:25.459
When I get out of here...
And trust me, I will...

27:25.494 --> 27:29.096
He'll be the first that I judge.

27:29.131 --> 27:32.566
He and all the other human
garbage that plague this city.

27:32.601 --> 27:35.235
All will be tried,

27:35.270 --> 27:38.805
convicted and executed!

27:38.841 --> 27:41.742
I will purge Gotham,

27:41.777 --> 27:44.010
and the innocents will thank me!

27:44.046 --> 27:46.279
Their savior!

27:47.516 --> 27:50.083
Their executioner.

27:52.554 --> 27:54.521
I know, and the best part is,

27:54.556 --> 27:57.791
that fake painting is still
hanging in the gallery.

27:57.826 --> 27:58.859
(laughter)

27:58.894 --> 28:00.794
Perhaps we might be able
to talk about something

28:00.829 --> 28:04.364
other than your previous
illicit exploits, Ms. Kyle.

28:04.399 --> 28:05.966
Oh, I'm sorry, Alfred.

28:07.336 --> 28:08.969
This was a great meal.

28:09.004 --> 28:10.337
You're quite the chef.

28:10.372 --> 28:11.938
Thank you very much, miss.

28:11.974 --> 28:13.373
SELINA: He's a catch, this one.

28:13.408 --> 28:16.209
Got a stiff right hand, too.

28:16.245 --> 28:18.044
Easy mark, though.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.546
(Maria laughs) Thank you...

28:19.581 --> 28:21.448
very much, cheeky monkey.

28:21.483 --> 28:23.150
Oh, you poor thing.

28:23.185 --> 28:24.518
Come here.

28:24.553 --> 28:26.620
(giggles)

28:26.655 --> 28:28.488
ALFRED: Oh... (chuckles)

28:28.524 --> 28:30.657
I see what you mean, though.

28:30.693 --> 28:32.893
- (Selina chuckles)
- ALFRED: Oh, well, that's just...

28:32.928 --> 28:34.861
Just hilarious. You
know... Really. Thank you.

28:34.897 --> 28:36.696
Thank you very much...

28:38.734 --> 28:41.134
Oh, I guess I better go.

28:41.170 --> 28:43.603
It's late. Stay.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.672
Alfred will drive you to
your hotel in the morning.

28:45.707 --> 28:47.841
(sighs) You're very kind.

28:47.876 --> 28:49.676
(thunder rolls)

28:49.711 --> 28:52.179
(distant car horns honking)

28:56.685 --> 28:58.185
Mr. Mayor?

28:58.220 --> 29:01.388
Unless you are bringing strong coffee,

29:01.423 --> 29:02.656
or you have information

29:02.691 --> 29:04.825
on my father's stolen remains...

29:05.994 --> 29:07.561
...go away.

29:07.596 --> 29:08.662
Yeah, but...

29:08.697 --> 29:11.264
CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

29:11.300 --> 29:13.733

Can I help you?

30:17.099 --> 30:18.265
Why?

30:18.300 --> 30:21.968
Why would you do such a thing?

What are you talking
about? What is that?

30:23.839 --> 30:26.339
You are a sick man!

The TV crew is ready.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.010
It's time for the interview.

31:04.046 --> 31:05.512
Have you seen the mayor?

31:18.781 --> 31:21.314
Carmine... call it off.

31:22.684 --> 31:23.984
Why?

31:23.990 --> 31:25.290
I saw Barnes.

31:25.325 --> 31:26.958
The virus has completely taken over.

31:26.993 --> 31:28.193
He's insane.

31:28.228 --> 31:30.094
What makes you want to save Gordon?

31:30.130 --> 31:31.462
Please, just call it off.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.764
You said you hated him.

31:32.799 --> 31:34.399
That wasn't true, was it?

31:34.434 --> 31:36.401
Call it off now!

31:36.436 --> 31:38.403
You talk of hate

31:38.438 --> 31:39.804
and revenge,

31:39.839 --> 31:43.408
but that's only to mask
what really scares you.

31:44.911 --> 31:47.378
You still love James Gordon.

31:54.754 --> 31:55.853
Where is he?

31:55.889 --> 31:57.055
We're minutes away.

31:57.090 --> 31:58.823
They're looking for him.

31:58.858 --> 31:59.924
Well, look harder.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.327
MAN: Here he is!

32:02.362 --> 32:03.595
Sorry I'm late.

32:04.864 --> 32:07.365
Mayor stuff. (chuckles)

32:07.400 --> 32:09.400
(indistinct chatter)

32:10.937 --> 32:12.870
Mr. Mayor, this is a pin...

32:15.375 --> 32:19.310
I hope you're ready, Mr. Mayor.

32:19.346 --> 32:23.014
The world is watching.

32:23.049 --> 32:25.283
MAN: And we're live in three,

32:25.318 --> 32:27.285
two...

32:29.990 --> 32:32.357
Mayor Cobblepot,

32:32.392 --> 32:35.026
as Gotham is enjoying an historic spike

32:35.061 --> 32:37.829
in job growth and prosperity,

32:37.864 --> 32:40.965
it is also going through
one of the safest periods

32:41.001 --> 32:42.200
in its history.

32:42.235 --> 32:44.235
And I'm sure everyone is wondering,

32:44.271 --> 32:45.837
"How did he do it?"

32:47.674 --> 32:48.674
Uh...

33:00.820 --> 33:03.454
Well...

33:14.734 --> 33:16.167
BULLOCK: Whoa, hey!

33:16.202 --> 33:17.468
Hello to you, too.

33:17.504 --> 33:19.203
You didn't think you'd get rid of me

33:19.239 --> 33:20.371
that easily, did you?

33:20.407 --> 33:22.373
I thought we might need something

33:22.409 --> 33:23.574
with a bit more bite.

33:25.779 --> 33:29.013
So, why didn't you tell me about Zsasz?

33:31.117 --> 33:32.350
It's my business.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.618
Yeah? Not yours.

33:33.653 --> 33:35.219
That's a bit ridiculous, seeing as how

33:35.255 --> 33:37.889
I'm standing next to
you most of the time.

33:37.924 --> 33:39.590
(machine gun fire)

34:02.248 --> 34:04.148
What's up?

34:07.253 --> 34:08.619
Drop it, Jim.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.588
It's your time to die today.

34:10.623 --> 34:12.090
Not his.

34:12.125 --> 34:13.391
Don't listen to him, Jim.

34:13.426 --> 34:16.060
Shoot him now!

34:16.096 --> 34:18.196
Relax, Zsasz.

34:18.231 --> 34:20.697
Job's cancelled.

34:24.904 --> 34:26.337
You can go home.

34:26.373 --> 34:29.139
Okay, boss.

34:40.186 --> 34:42.320
I'm sorry.

34:43.822 --> 34:47.625
If it was up to me, you'd be dead.

35:03.176 --> 35:04.342
Whew!

35:11.682 --> 35:14.548
So from humble errand
boy to kitchen worker

35:15.817 --> 35:18.383
to the so-called "King of Gotham,"

35:18.384 --> 35:22.286
it is said that many
died so you could rise.

35:23.961 --> 35:25.961
Oh...

35:25.997 --> 35:27.229
An exaggeration.

35:27.265 --> 35:30.532
People love to invent scandal.

35:30.568 --> 35:33.869
But it was murder that
sent you to Arkham,

35:33.904 --> 35:35.971
a prison for the criminally insane.

35:36.007 --> 35:39.041
I rescued the city

35:39.076 --> 35:42.278
from the madman, Theo Galavan.

35:42.313 --> 35:44.647
Some call it murder.

35:44.682 --> 35:46.649
Others a public service.

35:46.684 --> 35:49.852
And after your controversial release

35:49.887 --> 35:53.055
from prison, you met your father,

35:53.090 --> 35:54.523
Elijah Van Dahl.

35:54.558 --> 35:58.060
A man whose identity

35:58.095 --> 35:59.528
your mother kept from you.

35:59.564 --> 36:00.763
Oh, my God.

36:00.798 --> 36:02.564
Yes, it must have been very upsetting.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.900
What? Yes.

36:04.935 --> 36:06.969
He also died under
suspicious circumstances.

36:07.004 --> 36:10.039
His wife and step-children
disappearing soon after.

36:10.074 --> 36:11.940
I-I have to go.

36:11.976 --> 36:14.010
Why? Is it because there's
substance to the rumors

36:14.045 --> 36:16.345
that you had them killed to
inherit your father's wealth?

36:16.380 --> 36:18.446
Fa-Father, Father wait!

36:18.447 --> 36:19.579
(woman screams)

36:19.580 --> 36:21.447
Are you feeling well, Mr. Mayor?

36:21.452 --> 36:23.452
I'm fine. I-I'm great.

36:23.487 --> 36:24.753
Why would I not be fine?

36:24.789 --> 36:26.222
The people of Gotham, and America,

36:26.257 --> 36:27.423
want to know the truth.

36:27.458 --> 36:29.458
To hell with the people!

36:29.493 --> 36:31.327
(all gasp)

36:31.395 --> 36:33.295
(laughter)

36:33.331 --> 36:35.197
(indistinct muttering)

36:35.232 --> 36:37.399
Father, wait!

36:37.435 --> 36:39.735
Father?

36:39.770 --> 36:41.737
(gasps, panting)

36:44.709 --> 36:46.241
No! No!

36:46.277 --> 36:48.210
(gasping)

37:13.471 --> 37:14.770
A very good job.

37:25.516 --> 37:27.750
Ah.

37:27.818 --> 37:29.118
He bought it?

37:29.153 --> 37:30.652
Hook, line and sinker.

37:30.688 --> 37:33.956
Ah, voice wasn't quite
right, but, uh, you know...

37:33.991 --> 37:35.958
(slow clapping nearby)

37:38.796 --> 37:40.529
Bravo, boys.

37:40.564 --> 37:42.831
Penguin lost his mind on national TV,

37:42.867 --> 37:44.433
just like you said he would.

37:44.468 --> 37:46.769
It's all about the power of suggestion.

37:46.804 --> 37:49.338
<i>And whispering in the right ears.</i>

37:49.373 --> 37:52.007
Do what I say, and you'll
be the next chief of staff.

37:52.042 --> 37:54.577
Tell him, "I'm still grieving."

37:54.612 --> 37:56.645
Margaret Hearse is in your
office waiting for you.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.448
And remember to say
exactly what I told you

37:59.483 --> 38:01.049
about his father.

38:02.553 --> 38:04.186
(thunder rolls)

38:21.272 --> 38:23.906
TABITHA: <i>Why don't you just leave
these bodies for the cops?</i>

38:23.941 --> 38:25.574
Have him arrested.

38:25.609 --> 38:26.642
That's too easy, Tabitha.

38:27.645 --> 38:31.647
I want this to be a slow...

38:31.682 --> 38:33.982
painful death.

38:34.018 --> 38:37.486
One of a thousand deep cuts.

38:37.521 --> 38:39.388
First we take away his mind...

38:39.423 --> 38:41.023
That's the part I like.

38:41.058 --> 38:44.560
We destroy his empire
and take it for ourselves.

38:44.595 --> 38:48.263
And then, when this
bird is broken and alone,

38:48.299 --> 38:51.033
we do the humane thing

38:51.068 --> 38:52.568
and put him out of his misery.

38:52.603 --> 38:54.536
Mm. (laughs)

38:54.572 --> 38:57.106
(laughter)

39:02.346 --> 39:04.413
If there's anything I
can do for you, Ms. Kyle,

39:04.548 --> 39:05.781
please don't...

39:05.816 --> 39:08.016
hesitate to ask.

39:21.899 --> 39:23.131
Wait here.

39:23.167 --> 39:25.667
What's wrong? Just do it.

39:27.571 --> 39:28.837
(door creaks)

39:28.873 --> 39:30.572
COLE: Did you think I wouldn't find you?

39:30.608 --> 39:32.574
MARIA: I was headed back tomorrow.

39:32.610 --> 39:35.043
COLE: My money, where is it? 100 grand.

39:35.079 --> 39:36.478
MARIA: I don't have your money.

39:36.514 --> 39:38.881
COLE: What do I have to
do, beat it out of you?

39:38.916 --> 39:41.083
Leave her alone! I told
you to stay outside!

39:41.118 --> 39:42.484
Who's this?

39:42.520 --> 39:43.619
Nobody.

39:43.654 --> 39:44.786
We can get you the money.

39:44.822 --> 39:45.988
Is that so?

39:46.023 --> 39:47.723
Who from?

39:47.758 --> 39:50.726
The guy that dropped you
off in the Rolls Royce?

39:53.797 --> 39:56.098
One of you talk.

39:56.133 --> 39:58.634
Who's the rich guy? Mom...

39:58.669 --> 40:01.670
Leave her alone. Well, well.

40:01.705 --> 40:04.140
I hope she know what a
lying cheat you are, Maria.

40:04.275 --> 40:06.607
Bruce will give you the money.
He's a good friend of mine.

40:06.608 --> 40:08.741
Would you relax? Bruce Wayne?

40:08.812 --> 40:10.612
(pistol dry-clicks) Well, now,

40:10.648 --> 40:11.813
that changes everything.

40:11.849 --> 40:13.749
Why settle for a hundred?

40:13.784 --> 40:17.786
Perhaps I'll pay him a visit, tell him

40:17.821 --> 40:19.688
all about you.

40:19.723 --> 40:20.789
(door shuts)

40:20.824 --> 40:23.292
Who was that?

40:23.327 --> 40:25.661
That was my past coming
back to punish me.

40:25.696 --> 40:27.930
Was he the reason you
left Gotham before?

40:27.965 --> 40:29.298
It's complicated.

40:29.333 --> 40:31.533
We have to warn your friends.

40:31.569 --> 40:33.368
Cole is not someone
they should mess with.

40:33.404 --> 40:35.804
(sighs)

40:35.839 --> 40:37.606
Good job, Mom.

40:48.052 --> 40:49.184
Were you followed?

40:49.219 --> 40:50.886
No, no thanks to you.

40:51.022 --> 40:53.188
How did the girl escape?
You led the cops right to me.

40:53.223 --> 40:54.455
I turned my head for a minute.

40:54.456 --> 40:55.888
She must have stumbled out.

40:55.889 --> 40:58.357
But this proves that your designs work.

40:58.362 --> 40:59.861
She came back to life.

40:59.897 --> 41:01.663
But not for long.

41:01.699 --> 41:03.198
The current's still too strong.

41:03.233 --> 41:04.700
Her body couldn't take it.

41:04.735 --> 41:06.868
We have to move quickly.

41:06.904 --> 41:08.737
Gather the others.

41:08.772 --> 41:10.672
It's time to get him.
