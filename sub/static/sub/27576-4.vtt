00:00.413 --> 00:01.873
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.013 --> 00:03.748
There's this coach I heard about,
Kim Price.

00:03.849 --> 00:05.650
You're thinking about switching coaches?

00:05.751 --> 00:07.619
I'd be more than happy to coach you,

00:07.720 --> 00:09.821
and it just so happens
I have a spot open.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.256
I know you miss Lisa,

00:11.357 --> 00:12.691
but it's not my fault she's gone,

00:12.792 --> 00:14.359
so don't take it out on me.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.695
You movin' into my house doesn't help.

00:16.796 --> 00:18.296
Honestly, Georgie,

00:18.397 --> 00:20.365
you're so advanced now,

00:20.466 --> 00:21.900
maybe you do need someone like Kim

00:22.001 --> 00:24.102
to take you to the next level.

00:24.203 --> 00:26.171
But don't think that I'm
not gonna keep watching you

00:26.272 --> 00:27.839
like a hawk.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.108
I'll never stop being there for you.

00:49.829 --> 00:51.830
Look out!

00:55.101 --> 00:57.168
- You're not here.
- I'm sorry!

00:57.269 --> 00:59.270
Let me guess, jumping practice.

00:59.371 --> 01:00.972
I'll watch you ride tomorrow, I promise!

01:01.073 --> 01:02.307
Yeah, I've heard that before.

01:02.408 --> 01:04.242
I'm really sorry, Jade.

01:04.343 --> 01:05.677
You already said that.

01:05.778 --> 01:07.312
Look, don't sweat it kid, I'll...

01:07.413 --> 01:08.680
I'll catch you later, okay?

01:12.084 --> 01:13.752
Not in there.

01:13.853 --> 01:15.720
I'm putting Jade on Powerhouse.

01:15.821 --> 01:18.423
No! No way, it's a bad idea.

01:18.524 --> 01:21.025
What? Go on.

01:21.127 --> 01:22.494
I've seen him on the circuit.

01:22.595 --> 01:24.496
Powerhouse is too much for
most of the guys to warm up on.

01:24.597 --> 01:26.564
Hey,
my stock guy showed me what he can do,

01:26.665 --> 01:28.399
and I like what I see.

01:28.501 --> 01:30.101
I'm telling you, he's rank.

01:30.202 --> 01:32.871
Well, that's exactly what
my guys need to train on.

01:32.972 --> 01:34.839
Well, what about the girls?

01:34.940 --> 01:36.775
Powerhouse is the real deal.

01:36.876 --> 01:39.444
You show me.

01:39.545 --> 01:41.546
Yeah, I got this.

01:56.662 --> 01:58.363
All tight, watch out for this one.

01:58.464 --> 02:01.065
You all good up there, Jade?

02:01.167 --> 02:03.101
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

02:13.679 --> 02:15.346
Oof!

02:15.447 --> 02:16.915
Oh! Oh!

02:22.488 --> 02:24.088
Ah!

02:24.190 --> 02:24.956
Oof!

02:29.461 --> 02:31.830
Jade!

02:39.905 --> 02:42.140
- I'm gonna call an ambulance.
- Jade? Jade?

02:42.241 --> 02:44.115
Jade?

03:39.064 --> 03:41.332
Give me a sign if you can hear me.

03:44.770 --> 03:47.005
Okay, okay, don't move.

03:47.106 --> 03:48.873
Don't move, hey.

03:48.974 --> 03:51.809
We called you an ambulance.

03:51.911 --> 03:54.679
No, tell them not to come up.

03:54.780 --> 03:56.014
I'm fine.

03:56.115 --> 03:57.815
You're not fine,
you were unconscious, Jade.

03:57.917 --> 03:59.851
- I'm fine!
- You're not fine!

03:59.952 --> 04:01.653
Okay, you were knocked out,
you were unconscious.

04:01.754 --> 04:02.854
I just need to walk it off.

04:02.955 --> 04:04.856
Oh, just take it easy, Jade, come on.

04:04.957 --> 04:07.659
No, just gimme some space!

04:07.760 --> 04:08.927
Jade, you need to see a doctor.

04:09.028 --> 04:11.462
There's no more rodeo until
you get clearance here.

04:12.965 --> 04:15.700
Oh, come on, Jade!

04:18.437 --> 04:19.536
Hey, did you hear me?!

04:19.637 --> 04:22.072
Yeah, I heard you, I'm not deaf!

04:22.174 --> 04:24.809
Next time I say a bronc is too rank,
try listening!

04:24.910 --> 04:26.244
Oh, lay off, Caleb.

04:26.345 --> 04:28.680
It's not the first time she's
been bucked off a horse.

04:32.718 --> 04:35.386
Wow.

04:35.487 --> 04:36.721
I know.

04:36.822 --> 04:38.289
What's it doing here?

04:38.390 --> 04:40.858
Ty saved the life of a
pot-bellied pig at work,

04:40.960 --> 04:43.861
and the owners were... so grateful,

04:43.963 --> 04:46.864
that they decided to lend
him their RV for the weekend.

04:46.966 --> 04:48.967
Whatever happened to flowers,
and a thank you card?

04:49.068 --> 04:50.435
Yeah...

04:50.536 --> 04:52.070
Okay, Ty, give 'er a go!

04:52.171 --> 04:55.173
Okay! Hey!
It works!

04:56.475 --> 04:59.377
- We got a toilet that flushes!
- Nice. Oh!

04:59.478 --> 05:01.612
Is that supposed to happen?

05:01.714 --> 05:03.114
Oh...

05:07.553 --> 05:09.921
Well, I can't decide between the apple,
or the cherry.

05:10.022 --> 05:11.589
What about the peach?

05:11.690 --> 05:13.257
It's not our best seller,
but I have a feeling

05:13.359 --> 05:15.193
it's making a huge comeback this year.

05:15.294 --> 05:17.095
- Really?
- Yeah, Ramen and Poke bowls,

05:17.196 --> 05:19.464
that's a thing of the
past. Peach is the future.

05:19.565 --> 05:22.200
- Sold.
- Great.

05:22.301 --> 05:24.402
I like your facial hair, by the way.

05:24.503 --> 05:25.670
Yeah, thanks,

05:25.771 --> 05:27.438
just trying something different.

05:27.539 --> 05:28.873
So how's it goin' here?

05:28.974 --> 05:30.341
Uh, it's all good.

05:30.442 --> 05:31.776
I guess, I mean...

05:31.877 --> 05:33.144
Lou just did these performance reports

05:33.245 --> 05:35.213
on all the staff, including me.

05:35.314 --> 05:36.614
How'd you do?

05:36.715 --> 05:39.484
Ah,
the boss says I'm not assertive enough.

05:39.585 --> 05:41.019
I mean, it's-it's fine,

05:41.120 --> 05:43.488
It's good to get constructive feedback.

05:43.589 --> 05:45.456
Well, I tell you,
having been on the receiving end

05:45.557 --> 05:48.426
of Lou's assertiveness and
her constructive feedback

05:48.527 --> 05:50.595
many, many, many, many, many times,

05:50.696 --> 05:52.130
don't take it personally.

05:52.231 --> 05:53.698
Well, I mean, she's not wrong.

05:53.799 --> 05:55.466
I don't know how many
times I've asked the girls

05:55.567 --> 05:57.301
not to use their cell phones,
and they still do it anyway.

05:57.403 --> 05:58.503
Well, that's an easy fix.

05:58.604 --> 06:00.805
You see one of them texting,
or Snapchat-ing

06:00.906 --> 06:02.940
when they're on shift,
take their phone away.

06:03.042 --> 06:04.909
- I can't do that!
- Sure you can.

06:05.010 --> 06:06.644
This restaurant it's like a ship, right?

06:06.745 --> 06:09.013
And you're the Captain.
Your ship, your rules.

06:10.916 --> 06:12.917
My ship, my rules.

06:13.018 --> 06:14.452
My ship my rules.

06:14.553 --> 06:16.721
Okay, thank you.

06:21.493 --> 06:23.694
Doing some light reading?

06:23.796 --> 06:25.029
Oh, uh, yeah.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.031
- It's a great article.
- Thanks.

06:27.132 --> 06:28.666
I really like this quote...

06:28.767 --> 06:30.701
"If we expect our horses to
be at their physical peak,

06:30.803 --> 06:32.737
then why shouldn't we,
as riders, be equally fit?"

06:32.838 --> 06:35.473
Oh yikes,
I sound like a wannabe fitness guru.

06:35.574 --> 06:36.707
No, not at all!

06:36.809 --> 06:38.810
Everything you say here
makes a lot of sense.

06:38.911 --> 06:40.845
Good, now put that away.

06:40.946 --> 06:42.080
Let's get you warmed up.

06:51.924 --> 06:54.725
Okay, where do boots belong?

06:54.827 --> 06:56.527
On your feet, is that a trick question?

06:56.628 --> 06:59.730
No, the answer... is in the mud room,

07:00.966 --> 07:03.000
not in the middle of the kitchen floor.

07:04.837 --> 07:06.304
So, this came for you.

07:06.405 --> 07:08.840
Since when did you start
getting your mail sent here?

07:08.941 --> 07:10.508
Ah, just until I know...

07:10.609 --> 07:12.376
what my living
arrangements are gonna be.

07:12.478 --> 07:13.878
Just don't worry about it.

07:13.979 --> 07:15.313
What about Casey?

07:15.414 --> 07:17.115
What about her?

07:17.216 --> 07:18.850
Couldn't you stay there for a while?

07:18.951 --> 07:20.685
- Not an option.
- Why not?

07:20.786 --> 07:22.687
Not an option.

07:24.756 --> 07:26.724
I need your opinion about something.

07:26.825 --> 07:28.092
Really?

07:29.862 --> 07:31.896
It's my job at my rodeo school

07:31.997 --> 07:33.931
to make sure my kids are
ready for the pro circuit.

07:34.032 --> 07:35.433
I can't baby 'em, right?

07:35.534 --> 07:37.468
Well, I suppose not.

07:38.804 --> 07:41.372
So it wouldn't be fair to the older kids

07:41.473 --> 07:43.141
to have 'em riding low-end broncs.

07:43.242 --> 07:44.442
Because on the circuit,

07:44.543 --> 07:46.110
they're gonna have to
deal with the real thing.

07:46.211 --> 07:48.112
Where you goin' with this?

07:50.849 --> 07:52.550
Nowhere.

07:52.651 --> 07:54.652
It's been a long day.

07:56.255 --> 07:58.289
I'm gonna have a nap.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.391
Wake me up when dinner's ready.

08:00.492 --> 08:02.693
You get yourself up, or miss it.

08:19.578 --> 08:22.079
Stay relaxed.

08:24.816 --> 08:27.151
Okay, head up.

08:36.461 --> 08:38.328
Good.

08:42.534 --> 08:45.360
Good.

08:45.404 --> 08:47.238
So, let me ask you a question.

08:47.339 --> 08:49.440
How do you think you're gonna
do in the show tomorrow?

08:49.541 --> 08:50.942
Okay.

08:51.043 --> 08:52.944
Okay? What does that mean?

08:53.045 --> 08:55.012
Well, I'm aiming to place top five.

08:55.113 --> 08:56.447
Not first?

08:56.548 --> 08:58.883
I was just trying to be realistic.

09:01.253 --> 09:03.087
Who are you?

09:04.323 --> 09:05.423
What?

09:05.524 --> 09:08.092
Who is Georgie Fleming-Morris?

09:09.228 --> 09:11.095
I don't know what you want me to say.

09:11.196 --> 09:12.630
Look, that article I read about you,

09:12.731 --> 09:14.465
about being a future Olympian,

09:14.566 --> 09:16.000
it mentioned that you're adopted,

09:16.101 --> 09:18.236
and that your horse is a rescue.

09:18.337 --> 09:19.804
It made you sound like the underdog,

09:19.905 --> 09:21.138
willing to do anything to prove

09:21.240 --> 09:23.708
that she can jump higher
than the rich kids.

09:23.809 --> 09:25.676
Is that you?

09:25.777 --> 09:27.578
I'm not some rags-to-riches story

09:27.679 --> 09:29.146
you read in a magazine.

09:29.248 --> 09:32.316
Jumping isn't just my hobby,
it's my life.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.185
The only thing I'm out here to prove

09:34.286 --> 09:36.254
is that I'm the top
jumper on the circuit.

09:36.355 --> 09:38.689
Good. Then you need to think about

09:38.790 --> 09:40.124
what you're willing to sacrifice,

09:40.225 --> 09:43.594
because I'm not interested in
coaching a top five jumper.

09:43.695 --> 09:46.864
I'm interested in
coaching the top jumper.

09:46.965 --> 09:48.933
I'm pretty sure the only thing

09:49.034 --> 09:50.801
standing in your way right now...

09:50.902 --> 09:52.136
is you.

09:58.944 --> 10:00.578
Well, we've been planning
on going for a camping trip

10:00.679 --> 10:02.380
for a while now.

10:02.481 --> 10:04.482
You can't call it camping
if you've got a flat screen,

10:04.583 --> 10:06.250
and a mini-fridge.

10:06.351 --> 10:08.519
Oh! Come on, Dad, I'm just excited

10:08.620 --> 10:11.689
that we're gonna have a camping
trip together as a family.

10:11.790 --> 10:13.624
I'm sorry we're gonna miss your show,
Georgie.

10:13.725 --> 10:15.893
- Don't even worry about it.
- You nervous?

10:15.994 --> 10:19.063
A little, but I think we're ready.

10:19.164 --> 10:20.498
Actually, I'm gonna turn in early,

10:20.599 --> 10:22.233
I wanna make sure I get
enough sleep for tomorrow.

10:22.334 --> 10:24.635
Can I be excused?

10:24.736 --> 10:26.304
Yeah, of course. There's pie.

10:26.405 --> 10:28.506
Um, you know what, I'm-I'm okay.

10:30.175 --> 10:31.375
Are you feeling okay, sweetheart?

10:31.476 --> 10:33.077
It's not like you to turn down dessert.

10:33.178 --> 10:34.779
I'm just a little tired.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.180
Goodnight, everyone.

10:36.281 --> 10:38.616
Goodnight.

10:40.419 --> 10:41.986
If we leave first thing in the morning,

10:42.087 --> 10:44.121
we should get to the campsite...

10:44.222 --> 10:47.553
just after lunch so we can eat then,

10:47.826 --> 10:50.594
go for a short hike,
which I've mapped out here.

10:50.696 --> 10:52.530
It should only take
us maybe half an hour,

10:52.631 --> 10:53.764
and then we'll get back to the campsite

10:53.865 --> 10:55.599
just in time for Lyndy's nap,
and then you and I...

10:55.701 --> 10:56.801
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:56.902 --> 10:58.569
Don't you think maybe we should just...

10:58.670 --> 11:00.338
go with the flow?

11:00.439 --> 11:01.772
What do you mean go with the flow?

11:01.873 --> 11:03.341
Ty, we're travelling with a toddler.

11:03.442 --> 11:06.344
She might not exactly
cooperate with your schedule.

11:06.445 --> 11:08.279
Plus,
we have a less than stellar track record

11:08.380 --> 11:10.314
when it comes to traveling together.

11:10.415 --> 11:12.683
- What are you talking about?
- Do you remember when we went

11:12.784 --> 11:14.919
to that clinic in Montana,
and our truck got stolen?

11:15.020 --> 11:16.487
Which happened to be Dad's truck?

11:16.588 --> 11:18.489
- Oh, and then, Mongolia, and...
- Okay, okay, okay.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.790
I don't need to remind you.

11:19.891 --> 11:21.258
We've had a few rough patches.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.694
I'm just saying,
I don't want you to be disappointed

11:23.795 --> 11:26.997
if everything doesn't
go according to plan.

11:27.099 --> 11:28.599
All right, Amy.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.935
I can go with the flow.

11:31.036 --> 11:32.169
But nothing bad's gonna happen,

11:32.270 --> 11:35.139
This is gonna be the
perfect family vacation.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.774
Famous last words.

12:26.958 --> 12:30.060
- Morning, roomie.
- Is that my paper?

12:30.162 --> 12:31.729
I'm all done with it.

12:31.830 --> 12:34.698
The one I pay the subscription for?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.867
I'd wait a minute
before I went in there.

13:05.197 --> 13:07.331
Hey hon, if you want,
I can drive for a bit.

13:07.432 --> 13:08.732
No, no, I'm good.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.468
I just need to stretch my legs a bit.

13:10.569 --> 13:12.203
Yeah, I'm glad we stopped.

13:12.304 --> 13:14.104
Lyndy did not wanna be
in her car seat anymore.

13:14.206 --> 13:16.874
Oh? Hey, we're almost there,
okay, sweetheart?

13:16.975 --> 13:18.809
Puppy!

13:18.910 --> 13:20.077
Puppy?

13:20.178 --> 13:21.479
No, there's no puppy here, sweetheart,

13:21.580 --> 13:22.947
I don't think we brought
her little stuffed animal.

13:23.048 --> 13:24.415
No, we...

13:24.516 --> 13:26.150
- Puppy!
- Yeah?

13:26.251 --> 13:27.685
Hey!

13:27.786 --> 13:29.620
That's not what she meant.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.422
- Nah!
- Yeah!

13:33.358 --> 13:35.960
- What is it?
- What's that?

13:39.130 --> 13:41.699
Hey, there.

13:41.800 --> 13:42.500
Mm! Puppy!

13:42.601 --> 13:45.169
Yeah, it's a puppy.

13:46.805 --> 13:51.008
Hey, what are you doing out
here all by yourself, huh?

13:52.477 --> 13:55.045
Yeah, yeah, it looks pretty bad.

13:56.615 --> 13:58.816
Okay... yeah.

14:00.485 --> 14:02.887
Okay? Okay.

14:04.923 --> 14:06.290
All right, Tim,

14:06.391 --> 14:08.859
I wanna take another
crack at Powerhouse.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.729
You got a note from your doctor?

14:11.830 --> 14:15.966
I have to compete at the
Ponoka Stampede tomorrow.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.802
I don't have time to sit around
and wait at a doctor's office!

14:18.904 --> 14:20.104
Your mother's a doctor,

14:20.205 --> 14:21.739
I don't think you'll
have to wait very long.

14:21.840 --> 14:26.310
- She's at a conference.
- Well, find somebody else.

14:26.411 --> 14:28.612
Jade,
you fell off that horse really hard.

14:28.713 --> 14:31.949
You were out cold;
what if you have a concussion?

14:32.050 --> 14:34.552
Tim, I told you, I'm fine.

14:34.653 --> 14:35.886
Please just let me practice.

14:35.987 --> 14:37.688
If I don't compete and
make some money tomorrow,

14:37.789 --> 14:39.156
I'm gonna be behind on my rent.

14:39.257 --> 14:40.758
Well, I'll lend you some cash.

14:40.859 --> 14:42.426
I don't want your money!

14:42.527 --> 14:44.028
When I competed,
I did the exact same thing.

14:44.129 --> 14:45.462
I hid my injuries,

14:45.564 --> 14:46.997
'cause I didn't wanna
be out of the game.

14:47.098 --> 14:48.899
I didn't wanna be out of the money!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.334
But they didn't talk about concussions

14:50.435 --> 14:51.769
when I was competing.

14:51.870 --> 14:55.773
And they certainly didn't talk
about Second Impact Syndrome.

14:55.874 --> 14:58.108
Which means that if you
compete now with a concussion,

14:58.209 --> 15:01.312
it s not only dangerous,
but it is stupid, Jade!

15:01.413 --> 15:02.613
You could die!

15:02.714 --> 15:04.582
You know what?
You can keep me from practicing,

15:04.683 --> 15:06.951
but you can't keep me
from competing tomorrow.

15:13.558 --> 15:16.049
Can we talk about what
happened yesterday?

15:16.761 --> 15:19.029
I-I've got nothing to talk about.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.498
I have a couple things I'd like to say.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.666
Well, Caleb, you know,

15:22.767 --> 15:25.269
I got hard decisions
to make around here,

15:25.370 --> 15:26.937
I'm sorry if you don't like 'em,

15:27.038 --> 15:28.706
but that's the way it is.

15:28.807 --> 15:30.541
If my opinion doesn't mean anything,

15:30.642 --> 15:32.276
- then what am I doing here?
- Your job!

15:32.377 --> 15:34.411
Which is to teach those guys rodeo.

15:34.512 --> 15:36.714
So that's it, then?
The buck stops with you?

15:36.815 --> 15:38.449
Yeah, pretty much.

15:39.818 --> 15:42.653
Wow, well,
this is not what I signed up for.

15:44.823 --> 15:46.523
You don't like they
way I'm running things,

15:46.625 --> 15:49.560
that's fine, then,
you don't have to stay, Caleb.

15:49.661 --> 15:51.562
You really can't admit
when you're wrong, can you?

15:51.663 --> 15:54.298
I could, if I was wrong.

15:56.001 --> 15:57.501
I'm done talking about this.

15:57.602 --> 15:59.203
Well, I'm not.

15:59.304 --> 16:00.871
Look.

16:00.972 --> 16:02.573
If this isn't gonna
be a real partnership,

16:02.674 --> 16:04.775
I'm not just gonna be your "yes" man.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.677
I quit.

16:09.481 --> 16:10.881
Fine!

16:22.548 --> 16:23.882
All right, why don't you go get changed,

16:23.983 --> 16:26.852
and we'll go grab some lunch,
and celebrate this ribbon, huh?

16:26.953 --> 16:31.156
I'd love to, but I have work.
And it's only second place.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.458
Only second place?
That's nothing to scoff at!

16:33.559 --> 16:35.494
It should've been a first.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.397
All right, well, let's uh...

16:39.499 --> 16:41.366
go grab some ice cream
or something then, huh?

16:41.467 --> 16:43.568
I'm trying to avoid junk
food while I'm training.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.036
Rain check?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.038
Sure. Hey, come here.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.710
Listen, you were great out there today.

16:51.811 --> 16:55.843
Okay? And I am super proud of you.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.716
Thanks, Dad.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.359
Well, Lyndy's down for the count.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.529
- Oh, good.
- How's our patient?

17:10.630 --> 17:11.896
Most of these scratches are minor,

17:11.998 --> 17:15.099
but this one's pretty deep,
she's gonna need stitches.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.568
What do you think happened?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.904
I don't know, maybe some barbed wire,

17:19.005 --> 17:21.071
or a fight with another animal.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.641
Okay, what can I do?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.643
Well, if you could just hold her still,
like that.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.278
Good...

17:26.378 --> 17:27.913
I'm gonna clean this up a bit.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.915
Good girl...

17:30.016 --> 17:31.850
Just get that... you're doin' so good.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.785
You're doin' good. You're okay.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.987
Yeah... Yeah, you'll be all right.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.825
We're gonna help you out, it's okay.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.628
- You ready?
- Mhmm.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.402
So are we still on schedule?

17:57.343 --> 17:58.677
Hey, we're out of laundry soap.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.479
You might wanna pick some
up when you're in town.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.049
I'm not your maid.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.551
Pick up your crap,
you put your boots where they belong,

18:06.652 --> 18:08.987
and the newspaper from
now on is off limits

18:09.088 --> 18:10.956
until after I read it, is that clear?

18:11.057 --> 18:12.691
Oh, relax!
I've had Caleb on my back all day,

18:12.792 --> 18:14.793
and now it's you! Did you ever think

18:14.894 --> 18:16.995
even just for a minute that
your lack of consideration

18:17.096 --> 18:19.030
might be the problem?!

18:20.666 --> 18:22.100
I didn't think so.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.484
- Hey, Tim.
- You seen Jade today?

18:39.585 --> 18:41.720
Yeah, she's here at the diner. Why?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.456
Okay listen, she had a bad
fall during practice yesterday.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.424
She may have a concussion,

18:46.525 --> 18:48.260
I just wanted to call, and check on her.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.195
Well,
do you want me to pass the phone to her?

18:50.296 --> 18:52.130
Nope, no, no.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.633
Don't even tell her that I called, okay?

18:54.734 --> 18:56.468
If you could just keep an eye on her,

18:56.569 --> 18:59.304
and-and call me back if she seems off.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.506
Yeah, okay. Sure. Bye.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.508
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna need to take that.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.043
- Sorry, what?
- Your phone.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.012
Until the end of your shift. Why?

19:07.113 --> 19:08.313
Your mother has suggested

19:08.414 --> 19:09.948
I be a little bit more assertive.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.182
Of course being the boss' daughter,

19:11.284 --> 19:12.651
this could be a risky move,

19:12.752 --> 19:14.619
or maybe Lou will think that it's great

19:14.720 --> 19:16.888
that I didn't give
you special treatment.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.323
Or I could be fired.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.760
But either way, I'm doing it like this.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.300
Okay...

19:30.636 --> 19:32.771
This should do it.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.509
You're okay.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.846
Yeah, let's get this...

19:41.948 --> 19:43.648
down here.

19:45.484 --> 19:46.751
- Hey...
- There we go.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.220
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Easy now.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.789
There.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.558
We'll find her owners, drop her off,

19:53.659 --> 19:55.994
be right back on schedule,
this'll just be a little blip.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.362
Ty, it's fine.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.431
In a few hours,
we're gonna be at the campsite.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.899
I'll be flippin' some burgers,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.567
we'll be watching the sunset,

20:02.668 --> 20:03.902
it'll be amazing, trust me.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.338
It will.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.006
Okay!

20:09.442 --> 20:11.576
All right.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.881
Well, I got your message.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.883
What's so important that
you couldn't just tell me

20:18.985 --> 20:20.385
over the phone?!

20:20.486 --> 20:22.354
I quit the rodeo school.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.422
Oh?

20:24.523 --> 20:26.124
Tim didn't mention anything?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.727
Well,
he's not exactly Mr. Communication.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.628
Yeah, no kidding.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.897
If he can't see that I'm
an asset to the school,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.632
then he doesn't deserve me.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.234
I was right about that bronc.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.836
He should never should've
let Jade get on him!

20:37.937 --> 20:40.472
Look Caleb,
I don't know what you're talking about,

20:40.573 --> 20:44.042
but I think it best
I don't get involved.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.778
I need you to give him somethin' for me.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.713
It's mostly just old rodeo school files,

20:48.814 --> 20:51.950
and...
some mementos I won't need anymore.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.186
That's just a shot of Tim

20:55.287 --> 20:57.188
I used to have on my
wall when I was a kid.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.726
That was taken at our
first rodeo school practice

21:01.827 --> 21:03.294
as partners.

21:04.363 --> 21:05.964
Those were good times.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.234
Never thought it would end like this.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.508
- Thanks a lot.
- Puppy!

21:16.609 --> 21:18.643
Well, nobody's reported a missing dog.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.079
All right, well,
I'll post her picture online,

21:21.180 --> 21:23.281
and hopefully someone
will recognize her.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.884
Okay well,
I think we've done all we can for her,

21:25.985 --> 21:28.186
so we might as well
head to the campsite.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.321
- Bring the dog with us?
- Yeah, why not?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.123
Lyndy loves her. And if we leave now,

21:32.224 --> 21:34.125
we'll make it in plenty of time,
what do you say?

21:34.226 --> 21:37.228
- I say, let's hit the road.
- Okay.

21:55.247 --> 21:56.881
Are you done with the till?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.718
- What?
- I just need to get in there,

22:00.820 --> 22:02.821
did you forget how to do math, or...

22:02.922 --> 22:04.589
you kinda look like you're struggling.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.725
You don't...
you don't look so good, you okay?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.194
You okay?

22:09.295 --> 22:11.496
It's five dollars and
thirty cents change.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.501
Uh, I knew that.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.172
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

22:21.273 --> 22:22.874
Yeah,
I'm just-I'm a little bit nauseous.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.710
I think I might be getting
that flu that's going around.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.817
Thank you.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.018
Okay, I'm off.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.754
- Where are you going?
- Uh, the Ponoka Stampede.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.690
I'm riding in the morning,
so I thought I'd head out tonight.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.492
Well, are you sure that's a good idea?

22:40.593 --> 22:42.060
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

22:44.296 --> 22:47.332
Okay, look, Tim told me what happened.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.768
Don't you think maybe you
should sit this one out?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.504
I don't think so.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.172
Okay, wait!

22:54.273 --> 22:57.308
When I was trick riding some
of the girls got concussions.

22:57.409 --> 23:00.078
They'd get confused,
kinda like you did at the till.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.947
They'd get dizzy,
ringing in their ears, nausea.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.983
Does that sound familiar?

23:05.084 --> 23:07.252
You know, it's kinda funny how
I haven't seen you in weeks

23:07.353 --> 23:08.653
ever since you started practicing

23:08.754 --> 23:10.622
with that fancy new coach,
and now all of the sudden

23:10.723 --> 23:14.092
- you're all up in my business!
- That is not fair!

23:14.193 --> 23:15.860
You know what? I'm going to that rodeo.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.896
And there's nothing that you or
Tim can say to change my mind.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.898
So why don't you go back
to being a big-time jumper,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.199
and stay outta my way!

23:38.884 --> 23:40.084
You're right,

23:40.186 --> 23:43.154
I haven't been a very
good friend and I'm sorry.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.690
But you risking your life,
it's not worth it!

23:45.791 --> 23:47.492
Will you just leave me alone?

23:47.593 --> 23:49.494
You're my friend, Jade,
I'm not gonna leave you alone.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.962
That's not what friends do.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.665
If you have a concussion
and you hit your head again,

23:53.766 --> 23:55.500
it's not gonna be good.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.267
Please, please don't go!

24:02.741 --> 24:04.042
Jade!

24:13.211 --> 24:14.645
- Oh, good job!
- All right, girls!

24:14.746 --> 24:16.981
- The burgers are almost done.
- All right.

24:17.082 --> 24:19.850
First I have to change this
stinky little munchkin.

24:19.951 --> 24:21.385
Hey?

24:21.486 --> 24:23.654
Hey, Ty, where uh,

24:23.755 --> 24:25.256
where's the dog?

24:25.357 --> 24:27.291
She's right...

24:27.392 --> 24:29.727
well, she was right there.

24:29.828 --> 24:31.061
Okay, well, she can't have gone far.

24:31.163 --> 24:33.464
I'll-you change Lyndy,
I'll go find the dog, all right?

24:33.565 --> 24:35.232
- Okay.
- Dog?

24:37.335 --> 24:40.460
You know,
it would help if we knew her name.

24:41.106 --> 24:44.479
Dog! Where are you?

24:57.122 --> 24:58.622
Dinner'll be ready soon.

24:58.723 --> 25:01.225
There's a full pot of
coffee if you're thirsty.

25:01.326 --> 25:04.495
May I ask what inspired this
sudden wave of thoughtfulness?

25:04.596 --> 25:07.932
Well Jack, I was thinking about...

25:08.033 --> 25:09.633
about what you said,

25:09.734 --> 25:12.803
laying down the law like that,
and you're right.

25:12.904 --> 25:14.438
It's your home, I'm a guest,

25:14.539 --> 25:17.708
and I'm... I'm grateful for everything.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.477
Hmm.

25:19.578 --> 25:21.245
What is all that stuff?

25:22.414 --> 25:24.415
It's from Caleb.

25:32.791 --> 25:35.726
I haven't seen one of those in a while.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.928
So what's going on with you two?

25:39.698 --> 25:40.931
I don't know what he said,

25:41.032 --> 25:43.300
but for the record,
he's the one that left, not me.

25:43.401 --> 25:46.337
Well, I know, break-ups,
they can be so hard.

25:46.438 --> 25:47.738
Ha.

25:49.241 --> 25:51.675
Caleb thinks this bronc, Powerhouse,

25:51.776 --> 25:54.411
that I put Jade on was rank.

25:54.513 --> 25:56.180
Was he?

25:56.281 --> 25:58.415
I've seen worse.

25:58.517 --> 26:00.518
Maybe.

26:01.586 --> 26:04.088
I'm just trying to prepare her...

26:04.189 --> 26:06.156
for the kind of broncs
that she'll be riding

26:06.258 --> 26:08.859
when she gets out there
in the real world.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.227
But she got bucked off,

26:10.328 --> 26:13.063
and I think she's got a concussion.

26:13.164 --> 26:14.732
I suppose you're on Caleb's side?

26:14.833 --> 26:16.166
Oh, I'm not saying that.

26:16.268 --> 26:19.436
Sometimes you have to push the
baby chicks out of the nest.

26:19.538 --> 26:21.705
You hope they take flight,
but there's always a risk

26:21.806 --> 26:24.542
they're gonna hit the ground hard.

26:25.744 --> 26:27.745
So why do I feel so bad?

26:27.846 --> 26:31.215
Because you think of
Jade more like family.

26:33.184 --> 26:36.354
Look, I think you and Caleb,

26:36.454 --> 26:38.556
well, you both want the same thing,

26:38.657 --> 26:41.225
you wanna get these kids
ready for the real world,

26:41.326 --> 26:43.360
so maybe, just maybe,

26:43.461 --> 26:45.362
you might try...

26:45.463 --> 26:47.798
not to butt heads,

26:47.899 --> 26:49.833
and meet in the middle instead.

26:52.871 --> 26:54.471
Yes sir, that needs more salt.

26:58.577 --> 27:00.244
Hey, we need to talk.

27:01.313 --> 27:04.014
I think I went too far earlier.

27:04.516 --> 27:06.617
The truth is,
I'm not really much of a Captain.

27:06.718 --> 27:08.352
- Captain?
- I'm more of a first mate.

27:08.453 --> 27:10.888
But I have to fill in for the
Captain when she's in New York.

27:10.989 --> 27:12.089
Do you know what I'm saying?

27:12.190 --> 27:13.924
No idea what you're talking about.

27:14.025 --> 27:17.795
The point is,
I shouldn't have taken your phone.

27:17.896 --> 27:19.229
That's not the kind of Captain,

27:19.331 --> 27:21.599
or manager that I wanna be.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.602
Just please don't use
it at work from now on.

27:24.703 --> 27:26.036
I mean,
a discreet text behind the counter

27:26.137 --> 27:27.471
is not the end of the world,

27:27.572 --> 27:29.106
but absolutely no live tweeting,

27:29.207 --> 27:30.608
and none of that whatever it is

27:30.709 --> 27:33.043
where you put dog's faces on people.

27:33.144 --> 27:35.479
I have to go.

27:35.580 --> 27:37.481
- What?
- Yeah, I'm really sorry,

27:37.582 --> 27:39.249
I can work a double shift
tomorrow to make it up.

27:39.351 --> 27:41.785
- But...
- Hey.

27:41.886 --> 27:43.587
Hey Dad, what're you doing here?

27:43.688 --> 27:45.389
I thought we could go maybe
grab some dinner together.

27:45.490 --> 27:46.957
You get a dinner break here, right?

27:47.058 --> 27:48.859
Yeah, I would really love to,
but I have to go.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.060
Go where?

27:50.161 --> 27:51.428
I'm helping Jade with something,

27:51.529 --> 27:53.430
it's really important,
I'll tell you about it tonight.

27:53.531 --> 27:54.965
- Right now I've gotta go!
- Okay. Yeah, yeah,

27:55.066 --> 27:56.634
I'll see you at home.

28:01.072 --> 28:03.474
- I found her!
- Oh, good!

28:03.575 --> 28:05.542
Yeah, she chewed on her stitches though,

28:05.644 --> 28:07.211
so we're gonna have to
re-suture the wound.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.847
Okay, well, I can give you a hand,
I just put Lyndy to bed.

28:11.249 --> 28:13.851
- What happened to the burgers?
- What's wrong with them?

28:13.952 --> 28:14.952
Well...

28:15.053 --> 28:16.520
I know, I'm just kidding.

28:16.621 --> 28:19.156
I- I'm sorry,
by the time I got done with Lyndy,

28:19.257 --> 28:21.291
they were charred.

28:21.393 --> 28:24.094
It's okay,
I'm too exhausted to eat anyway, so.

28:24.195 --> 28:25.496
Yeah, me too.

28:25.597 --> 28:27.631
But you're not too exhausted
to watch the sunset, right?

28:27.732 --> 28:28.999
No, not at all.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.834
We'll stitch her up,
and we'll head back outside.

28:30.935 --> 28:32.903
- Okay.
- We've got plenty of time.

28:36.207 --> 28:38.375
So I took your advice on
how to be more assertive.

28:38.476 --> 28:40.310
Oh yeah? How'd that go?

28:40.412 --> 28:42.546
Terrible. It was worth a shot.

28:42.647 --> 28:45.015
But I don't think dictatorship
is my management style.

28:45.116 --> 28:47.518
Oh, well, I'm sorry if I steered you

28:47.619 --> 28:48.852
in the wrong direction there.

28:48.953 --> 28:50.521
No, no, no, it's not your fault.

28:50.622 --> 28:52.389
Reading between the
lines of Lou's report,

28:52.490 --> 28:54.892
I think Lou just really
wants me to be more like Lou.

28:54.993 --> 28:56.994
And I'm not, and I don't have to be.

28:57.095 --> 28:59.029
I mean, sales are up,
and staff retention's up,

28:59.130 --> 29:00.731
And it's all because I'm good at my job.

29:00.832 --> 29:04.368
So I think next time I just
will not second guess myself.

29:04.469 --> 29:06.370
Well, I for one know for a fact

29:06.471 --> 29:08.706
that Lou's lucky to have you on board.

29:08.807 --> 29:11.141
Thanks. Can I get you anything else?

29:11.242 --> 29:12.609
No, no, just the bill, I think.

29:12.711 --> 29:14.244
Okay.

29:16.381 --> 29:17.948
Hey, uh...

29:18.049 --> 29:19.883
Georgie didn't happen to mention

29:19.984 --> 29:21.618
where she was going with Jade, did she?

29:21.720 --> 29:23.420
No, I have enough trouble keeping track

29:23.521 --> 29:25.155
of my own teenager.

29:25.256 --> 29:26.590
I think I saw him this morning.

29:26.691 --> 29:28.625
So I'm pretty sure he's still alive,
so it's a good thing.

29:28.727 --> 29:31.199
Right. Yeah, I hear ya.

29:31.563 --> 29:33.731
I've barely seen Georgie
at all this visit.

29:33.832 --> 29:35.966
She's got this whole life
of her own now, you know?

29:36.067 --> 29:38.302
I mean, of course she does.
She's not a kid anymore.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.704
But I usually have my other daughter,
Katie, with me,

29:40.805 --> 29:43.107
but she's with her mom, so...

29:43.208 --> 29:45.109
I don't know what to do with myself,
you know?

29:45.210 --> 29:46.844
Well,
you can stay here as long as you'd like.

29:46.945 --> 29:48.779
Oh no, no, no. It's fine.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.614
I've taken up enough of your time,
I'll just go.

29:50.715 --> 29:52.850
No, no, no, stay. Have dessert.

29:52.951 --> 29:54.852
Uh, Gunther,
a German tourist was in here this week,

29:54.953 --> 29:57.654
and said we have the
best pie in the country.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.323
Aha.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.325
Well, if it's good enough for Gunther...

30:01.426 --> 30:03.894
What kind would you like?

30:03.995 --> 30:05.729
Ah, let's go with peach.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.998
I hear it's making a comeback.

30:08.099 --> 30:10.033
I heard that too. Sure.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.714
Jade, are you okay?

30:26.351 --> 30:28.218
What if I can't compete anymore?

30:30.655 --> 30:32.489
I-I'm sure you'll figure something out.

30:32.590 --> 30:34.992
You don't understand, Georgie!

30:35.093 --> 30:38.627
Rodeo is... my life.

30:41.933 --> 30:43.700
If I found out I
couldn't compete anymore,

30:43.802 --> 30:47.237
I wouldn't be handling it
nearly as well as you are.

30:47.338 --> 30:50.440
You're the bravest person I know, Jade.

30:50.542 --> 30:52.309
But you don't need to
be brave right now,

30:52.410 --> 30:54.745
It's okay to be scared.

31:02.253 --> 31:03.687
Will you go to the doctor with me?

31:03.788 --> 31:06.790
Of course,
I'll be with you every step of the way.

31:32.466 --> 31:33.700
Ohhh...

31:38.672 --> 31:40.940
Hey, it's okay, little girl.

31:41.041 --> 31:42.675
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

31:42.776 --> 31:44.711
Easy, you're okay.

31:48.115 --> 31:49.716
It's okay.

31:55.322 --> 31:57.891
Lyndy okay?

31:57.992 --> 32:00.393
Yeah, she's fine, she's fast asleep.

32:00.494 --> 32:03.096
Is it time to watch the sunset?

32:04.698 --> 32:06.799
I think we're a little late for that.

32:06.901 --> 32:10.403
I can't believe we fell asleep.

32:10.504 --> 32:11.804
Yeah, you were right.

32:11.906 --> 32:13.573
Every trip we go on,

32:13.674 --> 32:15.441
it turns out to be a disaster.

32:15.543 --> 32:18.444
Oh, come on, Ty,
this was hardly a disaster.

32:20.681 --> 32:22.248
I know, it's just...

32:22.349 --> 32:24.117
it's our first family vacation,

32:24.218 --> 32:26.920
and I just wanted it to be
more memorable for Lyndy.

32:27.021 --> 32:29.939
Hey, Lyndy had a great time.

32:30.090 --> 32:32.091
And she got to see her Dad save a dog,

32:32.193 --> 32:36.200
which I would say is pretty memorable.

32:37.097 --> 32:39.399
Well...

32:39.500 --> 32:40.967
I guess.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.073
It's not the same, though.

32:48.108 --> 32:50.176
The same as what?

32:52.646 --> 32:57.183
Camping at Eagle Lake with
my parents when I was a kid.

32:57.284 --> 33:00.119
That was an amazing time. It was just...

33:00.221 --> 33:02.222
pretty much the perfect trip.

33:04.658 --> 33:06.993
What do you remember the most?

33:07.094 --> 33:08.995
Uh...

33:10.197 --> 33:11.764
my parents laughter.

33:13.934 --> 33:16.569
And the way the sun would hit
their faces in the morning,

33:16.670 --> 33:18.538
and...

33:22.743 --> 33:25.578
how pitch black it was at night.

33:25.679 --> 33:27.680
It was so black.

33:27.781 --> 33:30.717
But then I'd feel so safe
just tucked in between them,

33:30.818 --> 33:32.819
in our tiny little tent.

33:33.988 --> 33:36.022
Yeah,
that does sound like a perfect trip.

33:38.959 --> 33:41.127
Yeah, it was.

33:44.632 --> 33:47.267
That was the last time
your family was together,

33:47.368 --> 33:49.502
before your Dad left, right?

33:49.603 --> 33:51.571
Yeah.

33:57.478 --> 34:02.633
You know, Ty, your Dad gave
you that one, perfect trip.

34:03.050 --> 34:06.524
But you're gonna give Lyndy
so much more than that.

34:07.054 --> 34:11.600
You're gonna give her a
lifetime full of good memories.

34:12.826 --> 34:14.860
This is just the beginning.

34:18.165 --> 34:19.732
Yeah.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.447
Morning, Jack.

34:34.547 --> 34:36.416
Hey, how does bacon and
eggs for breakfast sound?

34:36.516 --> 34:37.717
That sounds pretty good to me.

34:37.818 --> 34:40.253
Well, good,
because that's all I'm making.

34:40.353 --> 34:41.420
Can I give you a hand?

34:41.522 --> 34:43.389
Yeah, eggs are in the fridge.

34:44.824 --> 34:47.092
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah, shoot.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.862
When Marion was a teenager,

34:50.964 --> 34:53.232
did you ever feel like every
time you walked into a room,

34:53.333 --> 34:55.435
she basically just wanted
to run the other way?

34:57.036 --> 34:59.339
Oh, Marion was a good kid,

34:59.440 --> 35:01.307
but there definitely was a time

35:01.408 --> 35:03.609
when horses and friends

35:03.711 --> 35:05.778
took priority over her old Dad.

35:05.879 --> 35:08.548
Yeah, so how'd you deal with that?

35:08.649 --> 35:12.251
Well, whenever I felt I
needed to check in with her,

35:12.353 --> 35:14.087
I'd take her on a trail ride.

35:16.123 --> 35:17.790
Right, that makes sense.

35:17.891 --> 35:20.259
A common interest,
something that you both enjoy.

35:20.361 --> 35:22.362
Something that Marion
wouldn't think is lame.

35:22.463 --> 35:24.564
Exactly.

35:24.665 --> 35:25.665
You know, when I think about it,

35:25.766 --> 35:28.334
her teenage years, they were a breeze.

35:28.435 --> 35:30.303
You just wait
'til your daughter's grown up,

35:30.404 --> 35:33.506
and gets engaged to some
hot-shot rodeo cowboy

35:33.607 --> 35:34.974
with a chip on his shoulder!

35:35.075 --> 35:37.310
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not ready for that!

35:37.411 --> 35:39.801
You're gonna give me
a heart attack here.

35:40.114 --> 35:42.715
Hey...

35:42.816 --> 35:44.717
it happens fast, doesn't it?

35:44.818 --> 35:46.719
Too fast.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.358
Puppy.

35:52.459 --> 35:53.826
- Mm... hi.
- Puppy.

35:53.927 --> 35:54.827
Oh, hey.

35:54.928 --> 35:56.829
- Puppy! Mommy!
- Yeah.

35:56.930 --> 35:58.398
Yeah,
it looks like we have some company.

35:59.833 --> 36:01.734
- Yes.
- Hey, you.

36:01.835 --> 36:04.504
There was a thunderstorm last night.

36:04.605 --> 36:06.773
You slept right through it. I did?

36:06.874 --> 36:08.808
Mhmm.

36:08.909 --> 36:11.277
This little monster was first,

36:12.312 --> 36:15.648
and then the dog wanted
to join the party.

36:17.851 --> 36:20.019
Well,
what do you say we have some pancakes?

36:20.120 --> 36:22.707
Okay. You want pancakes?

36:22.956 --> 36:25.224
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that sounds good.

36:25.325 --> 36:27.126
All right.

36:29.096 --> 36:32.198
All right, you guys, breakfast!

36:32.299 --> 36:34.734
Oh, there's my favourite trio!

36:35.769 --> 36:37.003
Oh, looks good!

36:37.104 --> 36:39.071
- Yes...
- It looks good.

36:39.173 --> 36:43.075
Ty, someone replied to the
post I did about the dog.

36:43.177 --> 36:46.345
- What'd they say?
- Her name is Penny.

36:46.447 --> 36:47.847
And they've been missing her,

36:47.948 --> 36:50.116
and they are so relieved
that she's safe.

36:50.217 --> 36:51.851
- Oh, good.
- You hear that?

36:51.952 --> 36:53.219
Yeah.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.188
Hey.

37:21.148 --> 37:24.383
You really must be obsessed with me.

37:24.485 --> 37:26.452
It must've killed you to
get rid of that poster.

37:26.553 --> 37:28.154
If you just called me to make fun of me,

37:28.255 --> 37:30.590
then I'm leaving.

37:30.691 --> 37:32.425
And this?

37:32.526 --> 37:34.360
I remember when that was taken.

37:34.461 --> 37:37.296
It was taken the day
that we became partners.

37:37.397 --> 37:39.332
I'm surprised you remember.

37:42.669 --> 37:46.272
The whole reason I asked
you to be my partner,

37:46.373 --> 37:50.119
was because I knew how much
you cared about these kids.

37:50.577 --> 37:52.278
I should've listened
to what you had to say

37:52.379 --> 37:53.846
about Powerhouse.

37:53.947 --> 37:56.382
But I'm not gonna stop puttin'
'em on high-end broncs.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.618
Because it's the only way to train
'em...

37:58.719 --> 38:00.761
for the big leagues.

38:02.289 --> 38:04.523
But I'll make you a deal.

38:05.626 --> 38:07.493
From now on,

38:07.594 --> 38:09.752
we'll pick the broncs together.

38:10.397 --> 38:13.766
And we won't let anyone ride 'em

38:13.867 --> 38:16.323
until we both agree that they're ready.

38:19.606 --> 38:20.973
What do you say?

38:29.049 --> 38:31.417
Yeah.

38:31.518 --> 38:32.952
- Yeah?
- Partners.

38:33.053 --> 38:34.487
Okay.

38:36.089 --> 38:38.124
- Okay, let's get ready.
- You got it.

38:42.462 --> 38:44.096
Jade! Jade! Wait up.

38:47.434 --> 38:49.302
You didn't go to the rodeo.

38:49.403 --> 38:51.337
I mean, that-that's good.

38:51.438 --> 38:53.472
I'm glad you're okay.

38:53.574 --> 38:55.241
Are you okay?

38:55.342 --> 38:57.677
Georgie took me to the clinic.

38:57.778 --> 38:58.811
And?

38:58.912 --> 39:00.780
And it turns out you were right.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.448
I-I have a concussion.

39:02.549 --> 39:05.585
The doctor said I have to
take it easy for a while.

39:05.686 --> 39:07.219
How long?

39:07.321 --> 39:08.554
A few months.

39:08.655 --> 39:10.456
Just long enough to keep
me from winning any money,

39:10.557 --> 39:12.888
or getting a scholarship.

39:13.093 --> 39:16.959
So that's it, I'm done.
I just came to get my stuff.

39:25.452 --> 39:28.467
Jade l feel terrible
about what happened.

39:28.655 --> 39:30.223
No, you were just doing your job.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.391
I should've been able
to handle that bronc.

39:32.493 --> 39:35.695
I... I'm just, I'm sorry I let you down.

39:35.796 --> 39:37.263
You didn't let me down, not even close.

39:37.364 --> 39:39.232
Okay? I'm the one that messed up.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.767
- Powerhouse was a bad call.
- No.

39:41.869 --> 39:44.036
That wasn't your fault.
I've been on way worse broncs.

39:44.138 --> 39:45.838
It was-it was bad luck, that's it.

39:45.939 --> 39:48.708
Just come back to the rodeo school,
please?

39:48.809 --> 39:50.743
Why? I just told you, I can't ride.

39:50.844 --> 39:52.645
Well, you can mentor the younger kids,
okay?

39:52.746 --> 39:55.748
They can learn a lot
from your experience.

39:55.849 --> 39:58.918
- No, I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

39:59.019 --> 40:00.319
I don't want to come to practice,

40:00.420 --> 40:02.788
and watch one of the guys bring
a buckle that he just won.

40:02.890 --> 40:04.423
A buckle that could've been mine.

40:04.525 --> 40:05.992
So thanks for the offer.

40:06.093 --> 40:08.661
I think you're making a mistake.

40:08.762 --> 40:11.731
Listen, you got knocked out
of the game for a while,

40:11.832 --> 40:13.966
that is a tough pill to swallow.

40:14.067 --> 40:16.536
But you'll be back, you don't just quit.

40:16.637 --> 40:19.672
- No, I've gotta go.
- You've gotta stay!

40:19.773 --> 40:21.541
You have to stay and show these kids

40:21.642 --> 40:23.776
that injury is a part
of this profession.

40:23.877 --> 40:26.445
That you respect the healing process.

40:26.547 --> 40:29.682
You don't just get injured and quit,
Jade!

40:29.783 --> 40:31.584
Come on, you're come back,
you're gonna be stronger,

40:31.685 --> 40:34.253
I promise you.

40:34.354 --> 40:35.421
I'll see you later, Tim.

40:51.572 --> 40:53.906
Say hello to Aunt Evelyn.

40:55.075 --> 40:57.009
I love you too, okay?

40:57.110 --> 40:59.045
Yeah. Bye.

41:08.121 --> 41:09.488
What is that?

41:14.628 --> 41:17.630
I was planning on proposing to Casey.

41:18.632 --> 41:20.132
I drove all the way down there

41:20.234 --> 41:22.902
to that rodeo she was working at.

41:24.137 --> 41:26.739
By the time I got there, I realized...

41:26.840 --> 41:28.341
it wasn't the right thing to do.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.743
And then I talked to her,

41:30.844 --> 41:33.179
and she agreed.

41:33.280 --> 41:35.815
It wasn't the right thing to do.

41:35.916 --> 41:38.217
So that's why I can't stay with Casey.

41:38.318 --> 41:40.386
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

41:45.125 --> 41:47.627
You know,
after that brush with death,

41:47.728 --> 41:50.529
I thought I had a few things
figured out in my life,

41:50.631 --> 41:52.098
but...

41:54.001 --> 41:58.170
it turns out that things are
just as complicated as ever.

41:58.272 --> 42:02.041
Well, you know what's worse
than things being complicated?

42:02.142 --> 42:03.542
What?

42:03.644 --> 42:06.112
Being dead.

42:08.682 --> 42:12.318
- This today's?
- Don't even think about it.

42:16.757 --> 42:18.057
Well, she's gonna be fine,

42:18.158 --> 42:20.259
just make sure she doesn't
chew on those stitches, okay?

42:20.360 --> 42:22.728
Oh, thank you very much for
taking such good care of her.

42:22.829 --> 42:24.730
- You're welcome.
- Oh, we don't know what

42:24.831 --> 42:26.799
we would do without our precious Penny.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.034
Mmm!

42:28.135 --> 42:29.568
Here. There you go.

42:30.671 --> 42:31.570
Say goodbye to the puppy.

42:31.672 --> 42:33.773
Puppy.

42:33.874 --> 42:35.908
Thank you very much for everything.

42:36.009 --> 42:37.410
You're welcome.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.779
Can you say bye to Penny?

42:39.880 --> 42:42.481
- Bye puppy.
- Bye, say bye.

42:42.582 --> 42:45.384
Say bye, puppy.

43:09.509 --> 43:10.810
Dad!

43:10.911 --> 43:12.044
What are you doing?

43:12.145 --> 43:13.646
Thought I'd join you on your run.

43:13.747 --> 43:15.614
It's so easy! Oh...
