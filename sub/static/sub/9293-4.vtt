00:13.160 --> 00:15.390
Curtis! Everyone back!

00:17.880 --> 00:22.431
The hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able
to recover the most recently accessed file.

00:22.520 --> 00:27.036
Some kind of wiring schematic.
How much of the file do we have?

00:27.120 --> 00:30.715
About a page and a half.
Mostly in Arabic, some of it Russian.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.870
Do you know what this is?

00:32.960 --> 00:36.669
This is a list of electronic components
for a nuclear device.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.831
- Hello.
- You have the package?

00:42.920 --> 00:46.799
- Not yet, but I'll have it soon.
- Call me when you have it.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.236
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will unless you do exactly what I say.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.710
There's a package in there. I'm supposed to
take it to a man who has an item for me.

00:53.800 --> 00:58.430
When you pick up the item, you'll call me
and I'll give you further instructions.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.873
There it is.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.558
Walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.

01:03.640 --> 01:07.349
I deleted those files. It wasn't right
to arrest you for my actions.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.716
- Don't touch me.
- Let him alone!

01:10.800 --> 01:13.837
- Sir, get back in line.
- Not until you let go of that man.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.839
- Mr President.
- What do you want?

01:18.520 --> 01:23.310
You are holding 110 so-called enemy
combatants at your Palmdale military facility.

01:23.400 --> 01:29.555
Have these freedom fighters on a nonmilitary
aircraft in the air by the end of the hour.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.758
If you don't release them by the deadline,
the consequences will be devastating.

01:34.080 --> 01:38.517
Jack, a nuclear device has been diverted
to a scientist with known terrorist ties.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.591
Pulling up the file now.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.396
- Do you recognise him?
- Yes. I saw him with Fayed a year ago.

01:46.480 --> 01:50.234
- His name is Hasan Numair.
- We need to know where this man is now.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.074
He's one of the terrorists being released
from Palmdale military prison.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.833
(man) Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.835
Sergeant, Numair is not on the plane.
Repeat, Numair is not on the plane.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.354
Hurry up. Fayed is waiting for you.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.794
- His escape was planned in advance.
- (man) I agree.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.158
Fayed's demand for the prisoners was a ploy.
He never intended for us to fly Numair out.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.993
- He wanted him free inside our borders.
- That's right.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.516
Do we know where along the route
Numair escaped?

02:28.600 --> 02:31.194
After the highway.
He must've had inside help.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.397
- Is there anyone unaccounted for?
- A sergeant is missing.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.234
We're looking for him now.
I'll call you when I have more information.

02:38.320 --> 02:42.598
- Chloe, what about satellite?
- We have coverage, but it's not continuous.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.150
There are two tunnels and three locations
where coverage is partial.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.950
Dammit. Numair is a known terrorist
with possible access to suitcase nukes

02:51.040 --> 02:53.873
and he escapes in broad daylight.

02:53.960 --> 02:58.636
We have to do better than we're doing
and we have to do it faster!

03:00.440 --> 03:04.638
- What else do we know about Numair?
- He's a nuclear engineer trained in Germany.

03:04.720 --> 03:09.748
Ran a weapons programme in Frankfurt.
Eight years ago he moved to the Middle East.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.115
Is his training relevant to existing systems?

03:12.200 --> 03:16.398
He knows it all and he's up to date. If he gets
his hands on the nuke, he can prep it on site.

03:16.480 --> 03:21.270
I want this at the top of our list.
Capturing Numair is our number-one priority.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.154
We won't be able
to set up satellite parameters.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.390
Yeah, I know. I know.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.278
Partition the grid.
Send half to me and half to Morris.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.351
- Morris?
- Just do it. Morris.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.352
- (man) We haven't seen a thing.
- We're monitoring.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.432
As soon as I have anything new,
I will share it with you.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.954
- As soon as you do?
- Yes.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.031
What are you working on?

03:50.120 --> 03:53.271
Setting up image processing
in the area where Numair escaped.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.432
- Dobbins can do it. I need you.
- Now's not the time to pull rank.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.512
Chloe's assigned me a task.
Please find somebody else.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.750
OK.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.435
- Chloe. What's Morris doing for you?
- What are you talking about?

04:05.520 --> 04:09.399
- He said he's on task for you, but I need help.
- He's not doing anything for me.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.878
- Is this ajoke?!
- You're upset.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.394
Our alert level's high
and you're playing games.

04:16.480 --> 04:20.314
If you can't work with me, then you quit!
The files are on your system.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.392
- Filter them now.
- I will.

04:27.160 --> 04:31.995
We assume there is a rogue nuclear weapon
on American soil, or there will be soon.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.674
All agencies are to proceed
under that assumption.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.832
- What are we dealing with, Karen?
- Suitcase nukes.

04:37.920 --> 04:42.232
The term refers to a number of devices
manufactured by the former Soviet Union.

04:42.320 --> 04:46.632
Small enough for one individual to carry
and they have a yield of one kiloton or less.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.713
- Potential damage?
- The kill radius is about a half-mile.

04:50.800 --> 04:56.193
The radiation greatly extends that radius,
depending on winds and weather conditions.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.239
Let's just arrive at the point.
How many casualties are we talking about?

05:00.320 --> 05:02.470
That depends on the population density.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.757
In a crowded city,
many thousands would die instantly.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.356
Taking the radiation into account,
the number of deaths and serious injuries

05:10.440 --> 05:13.637
would multiply into
the hundreds of thousands.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.915
Get me Jack Bauer... immediately.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.192
- There's nothing here. We're wasting time.
- You keep saying "we".

05:29.280 --> 05:33.398
There's you and there's us. There is no "we".

05:33.480 --> 05:38.235
Give it a minute. Anything that isn't
incinerated could give us prints or trace DNA.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.436
(phone rings)

05:43.040 --> 05:45.315
- Bauer.
- (woman) Hold for the president.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.435
(beeping)

05:46.520 --> 05:49.557
- Yes?
- Sir, Jack Bauer's on the line.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.200
- Mr President.
- Jack.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.233
We're in the process of verifying what
Assad told you about his peace initiative.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.914
Good. So far,
everything he's told us has been true.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.152
- He's given us no reason to doubt him.
- I hope you're right.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.949
I also want you to take charge
of the search for Fayed and Numair.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.068
- Mr President, I...
- After the way the country treated you, I...

06:14.160 --> 06:16.390
Well...

06:16.480 --> 06:20.712
after the way that I treated you, I know
I don't have any right to ask you anything.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.270
But you're on top of the situation
and I want to make it official.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.917
Mr President, the truth is,
I don't think I'm up to it.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.915
We are behind the curve, but if it weren't
for your efforts today, we'd be nowhere.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.434
I need you to lead this search.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.197
Then I'll do my best, sir.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.270
Report to Bill Buchanan at CTU.
Call me anytime you think necessary.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.033
- Yes, Mr President.
- Thank you.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.992
The president wants me
to run the search for Fayed and Numair.

07:02.080 --> 07:07.473
I can't do this without your help. I need you
to accept Assad as part of this investigation.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.155
He knows these people.
He will see things you and I would miss.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.470
He knows them because he's one of them.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.155
Trust me. We need his help.

07:17.240 --> 07:22.075
I can't believe I'm hearing this. Time was you
would've seen through this guy in a minute.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.720
What did the Chinese do to you?

07:25.720 --> 07:28.678
- Is there something you need to tell me?
- Like what?

07:28.760 --> 07:32.878
Is there some kind of a history
between you and Assad?

07:32.960 --> 07:34.678
(Assad) Jack.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.320
- They found this.
- What is it?

07:37.400 --> 07:40.551
It's a PDA damaged in the blast.
The message is still readable.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.996
- What does it say?
- "Visitor arrived on Thursday."

07:44.080 --> 07:47.311
"Visitor" couldn't be Numair.
He was still in custody then.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.437
"Visitor" is a codeword within the cell.
It refers to "weapon".

07:50.520 --> 07:54.513
- The suitcase nuke.
- Fayed must've received it last Thursday.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.275
If they had the weapon then,
why get Numair out of prison now?

07:58.360 --> 08:00.396
He must be key to making it operational.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.075
Get everything packed up.
We need to go. Move.

08:05.120 --> 08:09.830
Nothing is more important than finding
Fayed and Numair. You understand me?

08:11.040 --> 08:12.393
Yeah.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.878
(phone rings)

08:17.960 --> 08:21.111
- O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Jack. I need you to do something.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.078
I want you to run a crosscheck
on Curtis Manning and Assad.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.276
Is this important? I've got a lot on.

08:26.360 --> 08:31.195
Curtis has a problem with Assad. It's
personal. I need to get them to work together.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.714
I'll get it as soon as I can.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.837
Numair is here.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.195
- My brother.
- Fayed.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.311
- I was starting to worry.
- Yes.

08:48.400 --> 08:53.952
The escape went as planned, but I had to be
careful crossing the city. Where is it?

09:07.640 --> 09:13.112
This was the last model the Soviets produced.
Where are the tools?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.389
You're missing what I need to reprogram.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.994
- The device will be here soon.
- By what means?

09:24.080 --> 09:26.913
A young man named Ahmed.
A recent recruit, but reliable.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.917
Ahmed, we have known you and your family
so long. I can't believe you want to do this.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.549
It's not what I want to do,
it's what I have to do. I am a soldier.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.792
You said your father knows nothing of this.
When he finds out, will he be proud?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.916
(phone rings)

09:44.000 --> 09:45.911
- Yes?
- I have what you want.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.231
Good. Now you're going to deliver it
to a man named Fayed.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.311
- No.
- What?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.709
I won't deliver it
until you let my family go.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.950
Ray, do what I say or I will shoot them.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.033
Then I will destroy it and the people
you work for will be disappointed.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.758
- Listen to me...
- You listen to me.

10:01.840 --> 10:07.870
I just killed a man for this and I'm not gonna
deliver it anywhere until my family are safe.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.757
- I'll release one of them.
- Both.

10:09.840 --> 10:15.312
If I do that, I have no leverage and you
know it. Decide now. Which one do I release?

10:22.520 --> 10:25.114
- My son. Release my son.
- I will release your wife.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.113
- I just told you to release my son.
- You told me who you value most!

10:29.200 --> 10:31.634
Your wife will call you when she's clear.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.553
Deliver the component
and I will release your son.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.949
That's it, Ray. Don't push your luck.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.759
All right. All right, let her go.

10:43.080 --> 10:47.437
Get in the car and drive.
Then call Ray and tell him you're all right.

10:47.520 --> 10:51.513
This is the number that he called from.
Will you remember this?

10:52.680 --> 10:55.752
- Yes.
- Good. Tell him to call when you're through.

10:55.840 --> 11:01.392
And understand that if I see any police,
I will shoot Scott. Do you understand?

11:04.640 --> 11:06.232
I love you!

11:08.560 --> 11:09.470
Go!

11:28.520 --> 11:30.556
(phone rings)

11:30.640 --> 11:31.709
- Jillian.
- Ray.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.358
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.874
- What about Scott?
- He's still with Ahmed.

11:35.960 --> 11:40.875
He says if we go to the police, he'll kill Scott,
but do you think even if we do what he says...

11:40.960 --> 11:45.590
He'll still kill Scott when this is over?
I don't know, but we cannot take the chance.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.069
- We have to handle it ourselves.
- I don't know.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.720
Look, I'm gonna deliver the package.

11:50.800 --> 11:55.351
He already let you go, so we have to tell
ourselves he's got no reason to kill Scott.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.830
Look, I'm gonna call Ahmed back.
Do not call the police.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.069
OK.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.879
- Honey, I love you.
- I love you.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.756
(phone rings)

12:13.840 --> 12:15.831
- Hello.
- Ahmed, I heard from Jillian.

12:15.920 --> 12:21.313
Good. Take the package to 351 Old Mill Road,
Valencia. Do you know where that is?

12:21.400 --> 12:25.188
- 351... I can find it.
- I will call Fayed and tell him to expect you.

12:25.280 --> 12:29.114
Call when you get there. It should not take
longer than 30 minutes. If it does...

12:29.200 --> 12:31.509
I understand. I'm leaving now.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.236
(man) 911. What is your emergency?

13:01.320 --> 13:05.108
A terrorist is holding my son hostage.
I need to speak to the police.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.790
Dammit, I didn't want this tabbed.
I wanted it in tables.

13:21.880 --> 13:25.236
I work much faster with tabs.
I thought that is what you'd want.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.709
You're just being a pain in the ass.

13:27.800 --> 13:31.395
- Nobody speaks to me like this.
- I just did. Get back to work.

13:31.480 --> 13:35.951
This has got to stop. Everyone is extremely
busy and you two are distracting everyone.

13:36.040 --> 13:40.636
- Explain how to get him to follow directions.
- That's what you call this power trip?

13:40.720 --> 13:45.032
OK, excuse me.
We all know what this is about.

13:45.120 --> 13:49.636
Milo, you and I dated a couple of times
before Morris and I got back together.

13:49.720 --> 13:54.157
We saw a couple of good movies,
but we agreed it wasn't really happening.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.959
- Yeah.
- And you.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.237
So I dated Milo a couple of times,
but I chose you.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.196
Get over it and stop trying to beat him up.

14:03.280 --> 14:07.353
- You think this is about my insecurities?
- Yeah. Isn't it?

14:07.440 --> 14:11.638
No. OK, fine! If you want it in table format,
you'll get it in table format.

14:11.720 --> 14:16.510
Let's just stop this mad terrorist guy before
he detonates a nuke on Wilshire Boulevard.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.192
Thank you.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.080
Sorry about that, mate.
And, just for the record,

14:24.160 --> 14:30.315
there's no lingering jealousy about
any films you two may have seen together.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.799
No problem.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.075
(phone rings)

14:34.160 --> 14:35.798
- Bauer.
- Jack, it's Bill.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.395
The police got a call from a woman
claiming her son is held by terrorists.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.755
- Is she credible?
- I'm not sure yet.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.718
She says she was held too,
but got out somehow.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.155
- Is she on the line?
- Yes. Jillian Wallace.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.229
Patch her through.

14:49.360 --> 14:53.069
Ms Wallace, this is Bill Buchanan.
I'm transferring you to one of our men.

14:53.160 --> 14:53.831
Hello?

14:53.920 --> 14:56.912
My name is Jack Bauer.
Your son is being held by a terrorist?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.798
Yes, and he's forcing my husband
to deliver a package.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.440
- What kind of package?
- I... I don't know.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.511
There are other people involved.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.273
- What's the name of the man with your son?
- Ahmed Amar.

15:07.360 --> 15:11.239
- Did he mention any other names?
- Yes, one. Fayed.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.552
Ma'am, how do we reach your husband?

15:15.640 --> 15:17.756
You can't. He isn't carrying a cellphone.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.389
- Do you know where he took the package?
- No. I'm sorry.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.313
Whatever you do,
just don't let them hurt my son.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.597
We're gonna do everything we can.
We'll get back to you.

15:30.760 --> 15:34.514
- What do you think, Jack?
- She knew Fayed's name. What location?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.795
Channing and Fifteenth, Granada Hills.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.998
- Where's your nearest TAC team?
- You're as close as anybody. Take your team.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.559
Copy that.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.279
- Do we have a lead?
- Hostage in Granada Hills.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.670
It might be connected to the bombings.
Go to Fifteenth and Channing.

15:48.760 --> 15:54.153
- We can't take him on a tactical mission.
- We might need him when we get there.

15:54.240 --> 15:58.358
All teams, proceed to
Fifteenth and Channing, Granada Hills.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.878
- Mr President.
- It's good to see you, Mr Ambassador.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.871
- And you, sir.
- Please, sit.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.393
- How do you do?
- Karen Hayes.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.596
- How do you do?
- Tom Lennox.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.115
The events of these past few weeks
are deeply distressing for all of us.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.714
If there's anything we can do to help, tell me.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.509
You can help right now by having
a candid conversation with us.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.272
I'm always candid.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.353
Mr Ambassador, we've been in contact
with Hamri Al-Assad.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.796
He has been the driving force
behind a number of terrorist attacks

16:30.880 --> 16:34.270
around the country, around the world,
for the past two decades.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.672
- I know who he is.
- Assad claims he's renounced terrorism.

16:38.760 --> 16:43.311
He says he's willing to negotiate,
to use political means to gain his ends.

16:43.400 --> 16:47.712
- Now, do you think he's telling the truth?
- I have reason to that believe he is.

16:47.800 --> 16:52.430
How much influence does he have? Does he
speak for a large number of terrorist groups?

16:52.520 --> 16:55.478
As you know, there are literally
hundreds of such groups.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.075
Assad's reputation is such
that many of them, not all by any means,

16:59.160 --> 17:02.835
but a substantial number,
would follow his lead at least for a while.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.878
So this really could be
a significant step towards peace?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.757
I sincerely hope so.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.598
Thank you, Mr Ambassador.
You've been extremely helpful.

17:13.680 --> 17:17.194
- You're welcome, Mr President.
- (Tom) Mr Ambassador.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.597
So this corroborates everything
Jack told us about Assad.

17:22.680 --> 17:27.037
We need to formalise our relationship
with him now, lock him into cooperation.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.714
- Tom?
- I have a problem forming a partnership

17:29.800 --> 17:34.828
with a man who is responsible
for the deaths of so many innocents.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.389
- Is Assad still with Jack Bauer?
- Yes, sir.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.869
Let's get Jack on the phone, please.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.717
(phone rings)

17:47.800 --> 17:49.870
- Bauer.
- (woman) Hold for the president.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.633
- Jack.
- Yes, Mr President?

17:52.720 --> 17:55.996
- Do we have leads on that nuclear weapon?
- We're following one.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.150
It's too early to tell if it's meaningful.

17:58.240 --> 18:03.598
All right. I just had a meeting that confirms
Assad is serious about negotiated peace

18:03.680 --> 18:07.150
and that he does, in fact,
have the influence to make that happen.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.708
I'd like to come to an arrangement.
Is he with you?

18:09.800 --> 18:12.075
- Yes, sir.
- Let me speak with him, please.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.957
One moment.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.639
The president wants to speak to you.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.232
Yes, Mr President?

18:21.320 --> 18:26.599
I am prepared to offer you full protection
and a pardon for all crimes in the past.

18:26.680 --> 18:30.514
There are conditions, however -
that you continue tracking Abu Fayed

18:30.600 --> 18:34.434
and that you pledge your commitment
to a broader peace. Is that acceptable?

18:34.520 --> 18:40.470
In principle, yes. Forgive me, Mr President,
but I need to see this in writing.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.555
You'll have it within the hour.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.995
- Let me speak with Jack, please.
- Of course.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.233
- Yes, sir?
- This was not an easy thing to do.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.757
I do believe the greater good requires it.
Do you agree?

19:02.200 --> 19:05.988
I'm glad it's a call I didn't have to make, sir.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.958
- Thank you, Jack.
- Yes, sir.

19:09.720 --> 19:13.076
Your president, do you believe
he is an honourable man?

19:13.160 --> 19:15.435
Yes, I do.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.671
Mr Lennox, I have Sandra Palmer calling
for the president, but he's on another line.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.991
Could you transfer that call
to my cellphone, please?

19:27.080 --> 19:30.470
She specifically asked
to speak to the president.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.551
And do it now, please.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.192
- (phone rings)
- Yes, Sandra? Tom Lennox here.

19:37.280 --> 19:41.319
- I need to speak with Wayne. It's important.
- The president's tied up.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.914
Will you please let him know
I'm on the phone?

19:44.000 --> 19:48.391
The president's asked not to be disturbed.
Does this concern your friend Walid?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.631
Yes, that's exactly what it's about.
He's still in custody.

19:51.720 --> 19:55.998
You continue to arrest innocent people,
you're giving the terrorists what they want.

19:56.080 --> 20:00.676
The president is more concerned with the fate
of the country than the fate of one man.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.149
An innocent man, jailed without charges.

20:03.240 --> 20:08.268
If you believe the fundamental principles of
this country, there is nothing more important.

20:08.360 --> 20:13.957
You've got the makings of a great law-review
article. I will pass this message along.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.589
- If you'll excuse me...
- Mr Lennox, pass along another message.

20:17.680 --> 20:21.559
- What is that, Sandra?
- I will do what it takes to protect my client.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.234
If it embarrasses the administration, so be it.

20:24.320 --> 20:28.313
- Do I detect a threat here?
- Yes. And so is this...

20:28.400 --> 20:32.598
I am holding you personally responsible
for whatever happens to Walid.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.271
(man) Next, Samir Hadad, Samir Hadad.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.271
Walid Al-Rezani.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.356
Is there someplace I can get a drink of water?

20:52.880 --> 20:54.279
Brother.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.270
Thank you.

21:01.040 --> 21:05.033
- Thank you for helping me earlier.
- No problem.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.915
Did you tell them anything?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.594
- Of course not.
- Good.

21:16.960 --> 21:22.557
I'll tell you something, brother,
before this day is over, they'll all pay.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.631
What do you mean?

21:25.720 --> 21:28.996
Salim... what are you doing?

21:29.080 --> 21:31.833
It's all right, he's a friend.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.751
(speaks Arabic language)

21:48.840 --> 21:50.353
(speaks Arabic language)

21:53.160 --> 21:55.151
Khamsa ziwar...

22:19.920 --> 22:25.233
OK, take it easy. I... I got a package
from Ahmed, OK? Ahmed.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.836
Fayed.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.115
- Who is this?
- He says Ahmed sent him.

22:37.200 --> 22:41.637
- Your name?
- Ray Wallace. Ahmed should've called you.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.192
You have to call Ahmed
and tell him to let my son go. We had a deal.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.032
(Sabir) Quiet!

22:47.120 --> 22:50.749
Is this what you need
to reprogram the trigger?

22:51.760 --> 22:53.876
Yes. This should work.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.350
- How long will it take to complete assembly?
- 20 minutes.

22:58.560 --> 23:04.271
In less than an hour, it will detonate and strike
a blow that the Americans will never forget.

23:04.360 --> 23:09.150
- You're insane.
- Don't kill him... until you're ready to leave.

23:09.240 --> 23:13.392
He still may be of some use as
a bargaining chip if something goes wrong.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.870
Look, my... my son.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.350
He's just a boy. Could you call Ahmed
and tell him to let him go?

23:20.440 --> 23:24.433
I mean, I've done everything
I've been asked to. Please!

23:24.520 --> 23:27.592
I may... if you remain cooperative.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.319
I will. I swear.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.393
- I still have much to do.
- I have everything I need.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.711
When you've finished,
meet me at the safe house.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.439
(Sabir dials phone / speaks Arabic language)

23:41.520 --> 23:42.669
(phone rings)

23:44.080 --> 23:46.275
- Yes?
- Ahmed, it's me.

23:46.360 --> 23:50.353
- Did the device arrive?
- Yes, but it was wrong to involve anyone.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.079
I understand, but I had to. I had no choice.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.435
Never mind. It arrived, that's what counts.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.512
- You have a hostage, this man's son.
- Yes.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.875
- You have no further use for him?
- No.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.516
Then leave. Join the others.
But before you go, kill the boy.

24:10.640 --> 24:15.031
- Is that necessary?
- Yes. He's seen and heard too much.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.150
Do you understand?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.631
Yes, Fayed.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.834
The pardon for Assad looks satisfactory.

24:39.920 --> 24:43.230
- Tell the Attorney General to proceed.
- (man) Yes, sir.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.834
- (knock on door)
- Yes?

24:47.760 --> 24:51.639
- Mr Lennox and Ms Hayes are here.
- Show them in.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.793
- I approved the agreement with Assad.
- That was quick.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.917
It had to be. We don't have the time
to stand on ceremony.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.913
Tom, I know you disapprove
of this agreement, but put it behind you.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.037
The issue now is,
how do we position this with the public?

25:08.120 --> 25:11.317
- It must be kept from the public.
- That's not practical.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.472
It's to our advantage to make it known
Assad is on our side.

25:14.560 --> 25:18.678
Don't disclose the formal agreement,
don't use the words "pardon" or "amnesty".

25:18.760 --> 25:20.398
- We're cooperating.
- I agree.

25:20.480 --> 25:25.270
Let's portray Assad as a man who's not
a terrorist, but someone who wants peace.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.876
- Terrorist turned statesman.
- The point is saving lives. That's our focus.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.316
OK, so for every life
that was lost in the past because of this man,

25:33.400 --> 25:36.949
ten more may be saved in the future
by working with him.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.429
On the face of it,
the logic is compelling.

25:39.520 --> 25:43.115
Let's make a set of briefing points
and get them to our media people.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.191
I'm on it.

25:48.520 --> 25:52.991
I do have to say, Mr President...
I still don't like this.

25:54.240 --> 26:00.190
I understand, and it makes me appreciate
your loyalty all the more, Tom.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.719
- The Wallace kid's still being held.
- Copy that.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.394
Curtis, you and your team
take the back of the house.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.155
Come with me. We'll find an entrance point
from the side. Go on my command.

26:16.240 --> 26:19.357
All personnel, it is imperative
we take the suspect alive.

26:19.440 --> 26:23.877
Right now, he's our best chance of finding
the nuke. Slowly move into position now.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.518
Yard is clear. Cover me.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.117
Why aren't you talking?

26:53.200 --> 26:57.239
What's going on?
Did my father deliver the package?

26:58.840 --> 27:00.910
- Yes.
- Is he OK?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.195
Did he do exactly what you told him?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.719
Your father's fine.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.389
So...

27:13.080 --> 27:15.435
then you can let me go, too.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.037
Get up.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.634
- What?
- Get up!

27:25.560 --> 27:27.039
Why?

27:31.920 --> 27:34.354
My father did exactly what you told him to do.

27:34.440 --> 27:38.672
I swear... I promise you
I won't tell anybody what I know.

27:38.760 --> 27:42.639
Scott, don't make this any harder
than it is. Kneel down.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.873
I can't see what's happening in the house.
Does anybody have a visual inside?

27:49.960 --> 27:52.315
Not yet. My men are almost in position.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.471
- Turn around.
- You don't have to do this.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.869
Turn around now!

28:05.200 --> 28:05.950
Set.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.156
- All teams set.
- Curtis, make the call.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.198
(cocks gun) I'm sorry, Scott.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.759
Go!

28:16.360 --> 28:17.315
Freeze!

28:19.880 --> 28:23.350
- (Curtis) He's coming your way, Jack.
- Drop the weapon!

28:24.640 --> 28:27.632
- Hold your fire!
- (man) Hold fire!

28:31.760 --> 28:35.150
- Is he alive?
- Barely. Get the EMT up here now!

28:35.240 --> 28:38.550
I need him to tell me where
the boy's father took the package.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.269
- Get me an EMT down here now!
- Uh, I... I might know.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.349
(Curtis) Jack.

28:43.440 --> 28:47.831
When he was on the phone with my father,
he told him to take something to an address.

28:47.920 --> 28:50.559
Um... um...

28:51.520 --> 28:53.909
351 Old Mill Road, Valencia.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.076
(phone rings)

28:59.160 --> 29:01.469
- Buchanan.
- It's Jack. We've got an address.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.632
351 Old Mill Road, Valencia.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.672
Got it.

29:07.760 --> 29:13.073
Nadia, alert the two TAC teams.
We have a strike target. Deploy them there.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.993
Are you gonna save my dad?

29:21.840 --> 29:24.195
We're gonna do everything we can.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.674
(Buchanan) When we get the satellite feed,
download it to the TAC teams.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.355
Here are the satellite downloads
to Fayed's location in the last ten minutes.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.352
- Nobody entered or exited.
- What's the exterior layout?

29:44.440 --> 29:47.955
- Favourable. TAC teams won't be seen.
- Nadia, get me the president.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.838
We just don't have
enough specifics to go public,

29:50.920 --> 29:54.037
but I still want
all first-response teams in Los Angeles

29:54.120 --> 29:57.715
to be briefed on the possibility
of a nuclear detonation.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.872
Mr President, you have
an urgent call from Bill Buchanan.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.520
I'll take it.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.034
- Bill?
- Mr President, we have some good news.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.476
We believe that we've found
the suitcase nuke.

30:09.560 --> 30:12.154
- Where?
- Valencia, 20 miles north of the city.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.836
TAC teams will be there in 15 minutes. Should
I patch you into that feed when it's available?

30:16.920 --> 30:18.717
Absolutely, Bill. Good work.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.270
- Thank you, Mr President.
- I'll let you know when the feed comes up.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.474
Um, can we have a moment alone, please?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.070
- I'm getting you out.
- I'm not going.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.674
- Yes, you are.
- Sandra, listen to me.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.435
I think some people in this place
have a connection with the terrorist attacks.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.988
How would you know that?

30:48.200 --> 30:51.272
They were speaking Arabic,
which I don't understand,

30:51.360 --> 30:54.158
but there was one phrase
they used several times.

30:54.240 --> 30:57.232
"Khamsa ziwar."

30:57.320 --> 31:00.790
Pass that on to the FBI or somebody.
It may help.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.270
They're being held illegally.
Any statements they make...

31:04.360 --> 31:08.114
Dammit, Sandra!
Stop being a lawyer for one damned minute!

31:17.200 --> 31:22.069
These guys may be planning something
that will harm a lot of people.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.594
All right. I'll pass it on.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.148
- "Khamsa ziwar."
- (door opens)

31:27.240 --> 31:30.437
- I have to get back.
- Be careful.

31:36.640 --> 31:40.553
I just got it. Thanks, Bill. Let me know
as soon as the TAC teams arrive in Valencia.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.437
Will do, Jack.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.879
This is everything
you and the president talked about.

31:51.960 --> 31:56.078
You'll receive a full pardon in exchange for
continuing to help stop these attacks

31:56.160 --> 31:59.948
and for bringing your political group
to a negotiated peace with the West.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.793
- I need a moment to look through this.
- I understand.

32:02.880 --> 32:07.590
Unfortunately, I need to get back to work.
Agent Boorman will take you to CTU.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.360
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.071
Excuse me.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.998
- What's the document?
- Come here.

32:28.960 --> 32:34.478
I wanted to talk to you before it was executed.
I didn't think it would happen this fast.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.949
- We made a deal with Assad.
- Who's "we"?

32:37.040 --> 32:41.431
The United States government,
personally authorised by the president.

32:41.520 --> 32:45.752
Assad will receive a pardon in exchange for
full cooperation, which he has given.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.673
In other words, he walks.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.991
Like I told the president, it's not my call.

32:52.080 --> 32:58.315
It's not your call either. The responsibility
lies with him alone. It's out of our hands.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.389
All right.

33:02.480 --> 33:07.634
If that's the way it has to be...
that's the way it has to be.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.669
Yeah.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.358
(Jillian) Scott. Scott.

33:15.440 --> 33:18.398
Oh, Scott. Oh, God. Are you all right?

33:18.480 --> 33:19.549
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

33:19.640 --> 33:22.234
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yes.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.153
- Ms Wallace.
- Is there any word on my husband?

33:25.240 --> 33:28.357
We think we know where he is.
We've got agents en route.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.351
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.635
We will do everything we can to protect him.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.039
(phone rings)

33:34.120 --> 33:36.759
Excuse me for one second. This is Bauer.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.798
You were right about Curtis and Assad
having a connection.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.350
- Go on.
- Curtis was in the army after Desert Storm.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.749
His squad was ambushed by Assad's people.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.912
They killed five of Curtis's men
and took two hostage.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.560
Curtis was wounded.
He couldn't go after them.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.598
The next day, a tape was sent
to the television station.

33:54.680 --> 33:58.229
Assad's lieutenant forced
Curtis's men to beg for their lives

33:58.320 --> 34:00.550
and then personally beheaded them both.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.873
Oh, my God.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.313
Jack?

34:12.400 --> 34:14.550
Uh, I'll get back to you.

34:19.560 --> 34:24.156
- Where's Agent Manning?
- He was here just a second ago.

34:27.159 --> 34:29.913
Boorman, go ahead. I got him.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.114
You still don't remember?

34:34.239 --> 34:38.119
Special Forces Battalion,
32nd Support Group.

34:40.719 --> 34:43.393
Curtis, put your weapon down!

34:45.000 --> 34:46.149
I can't do that.

34:46.239 --> 34:50.835
By order of the President of the United States,
put down your weapon!

34:51.360 --> 34:53.748
- Stay out of this, Jack!
- I can't.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.956
I gave him my word that
we would protect him.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.874
- I didn't.
- Curtis, please. Don't do this.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.989
Please.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.268
I can't let this animal live.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.071
(phone rings)

36:31.600 --> 36:33.636
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Bill.

36:33.720 --> 36:38.236
Sprague told me what happened.
Curtis didn't leave you any choice.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.949
- That's what I keep trying to tell myself.
- You did the right thing.

36:42.040 --> 36:46.670
We need Assad alive. He's on his way back.
I think you should come in, too.

36:46.760 --> 36:50.833
Tell the president that I'm sorry.
I can't do this any more.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.799
The hell you can't. We're gonna find
that suitcase nuke because of you.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.953
- You've done great work today.
- Good. Then you don't need me any more.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.635
I'll send a car for you, Jack.
Come back here. We'll talk.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.711
I'm done.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.714
(phone rings)

37:24.120 --> 37:24.836
Yes?

37:24.920 --> 37:27.354
Mr Buchanan,
I received word that Ahmed Amar,

37:27.440 --> 37:33.549
the terrorist who held the Wallace family
hostage, died en route to the hospital.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.631
Thank you, Nadia.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.960
- Mr Buchanan, the TAC team is ready.
- Patch me in.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.635
Make sure the White House
is connected to the feed.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.391
(man) Watch your six.

38:08.640 --> 38:09.709
Here.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.916
Two, one side. Go, go.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.390
(man #2) Delta Unit, move in.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.510
(man) Delta moving in.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.118
Watch it, watch it.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.712
Engaged.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.238
- How much longer?
- Almost finished.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.959
I just need to reconnect the fuse.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.950
Sabir. I think I saw someone out there.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.508
- Who?
- Police. Somebody. I saw something.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.909
(shouts in Arabic language) Are you done?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.194
Yes.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.669
- Can you detonate now?
- Yes.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.669
Do it now! Do it!

39:27.360 --> 39:28.588
No!

39:50.800 --> 39:52.791
Oh, my God.

39:58.560 --> 40:02.235
Alert first-response teams in Los Angeles
and the surrounding counties.

40:02.320 --> 40:06.677
Let's put them in touch with the military.
Tell them...

40:06.760 --> 40:12.756
Tell them the resources of the entire nation
are at their disposal - whatever they need.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.031
Karen?

40:21.200 --> 40:23.191
Yes, Mr President.

40:38.920 --> 40:42.151
Mr Buchanan,
I just got a message from the FBI.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.550
They said it's important.
It's some Arabic phrase.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.871
- What is it?
- It was overheard in a detention centre.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.350
This phrase kept coming up.
I'm not sure about the pronunciation.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.793
"Khamsa ziwar."

40:56.200 --> 40:58.839
It means "five visitors".

40:58.920 --> 41:02.435
Assad said "visitor"
was a codeword for "weapon".

41:02.520 --> 41:05.956
There are four more of these things out there.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.511
