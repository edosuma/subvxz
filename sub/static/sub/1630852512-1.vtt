we were more like
siegfried and roy.

But the rat pack
is way better. I'll take it.

02:42.096 --> 02:45.297
[chris]
season six of battlebots.
Here we are.

02:45.299 --> 02:49.168
We're in our new home,
las vegas, the fight capital
of the world.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.237
And a killer field of robots
enter with one goal,

02:52.239 --> 02:54.072
to win the battlebots
world championship

02:54.074 --> 02:56.875
and become
vegas' newest signature act.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.412
Move over celine dion.

<i> [chris] last season,</i>
<i>  new zealand's end game</i>

<i>  did something that</i>
<i>  no bot had ever done,</i>

<i>  steal the championship</i>
<i>  away from the united states.</i>

03:13.060 --> 03:16.028
[chris]
<i>  that is it! That is it!</i>

03:16.030 --> 03:19.765
The american teams
enter this season
in an unfamiliar position,

03:19.767 --> 03:21.333
trying to reclaim that title

03:21.335 --> 03:24.236
and hoist
the most prestigious
trophy in the galaxy,

the giant nut!

03:25.206 --> 03:28.440
[cheers and applause]

03:31.078 --> 03:33.745
now, there are a couple
of exciting new changes
this season,

03:33.747 --> 03:37.182
and none is bigger than the
brand new upper deck.

03:37.184 --> 03:41.153
<i> [kenny] that's right,</i>
<i>  as the sport of robot combat</i>
<i>  continues to evolve,</i>

03:41.155 --> 03:43.956
<i>  the battlebox will now</i>
<i>  be evolving along with it.</i>

03:43.958 --> 03:47.826
<i>  The upper deck</i>
<i>  completely changes the</i>
<i>  geometry inside the box</i>

03:47.828 --> 03:50.095
<i>  and presents</i>
<i>  a whole new set of challenges</i>

03:50.097 --> 03:52.831
<i>  for these teams</i>
<i>  to adapt to or die trying.</i>

03:52.833 --> 03:55.434
[cheers and applause]

03:57.538 --> 04:00.706
let's take a look
at tonight's fight card.

04:00.708 --> 04:05.344
<i> [chris] we have got a</i>
<i>  stacked lineup of the world's</i>
<i>  most deadly combat robots,</i>

04:05.346 --> 04:08.947
<i>  all ready to take</i>
<i>  las vegas by storm.</i>

04:08.949 --> 04:11.049
<i>  After a year</i>
<i>  away from the carnage,</i>

04:11.051 --> 04:13.919
<i>  two legends make</i>
<i>  their explosive returns.</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:18.257
<i>  As free shipping squares off</i>
<i>  with the flaming hammer</i>
<i>  of blacksmith.</i>

04:18.259 --> 04:21.193
<i>  These two pyromaniacs</i>
<i>  are back to remind the field</i>

04:21.195 --> 04:26.231
<i>  what a good old fashioned</i>
<i>  robot slug-fest is all about.</i>

04:26.233 --> 04:30.902
<i> [chris] blacksmith going for</i>
<i>  the knockout blow. Oh!</i>

04:30.904 --> 04:34.406
<i> [kenny] if that's not enough</i>
<i>  firepower for you, take cover</i>

04:34.408 --> 04:37.009
<i>  because knockout artist</i>
<i>  uppercut</i>

04:38.512 --> 04:41.046
<i>  and tombstone</i>

04:41.048 --> 04:44.049
<i>  are here to bring the</i>
<i>  pain alongside the two titans</i>

04:44.051 --> 04:46.218
<i>  in tonight's main event,</i>

04:46.220 --> 04:51.223
<i>  defending champs end game</i>
<i>  versus last year's number</i>
<i>  one tournament seed, hydra.</i>

04:52.159 --> 04:54.326
<i> [chris] but to kick things</i>
<i>  off tonight,</i>

04:54.328 --> 04:58.330
<i>  we've got a match up so nasty</i>
<i>  it'll make sin city blush.</i>

04:58.332 --> 05:00.666
<i>  As jamison go and sawblaze,</i>

05:00.668 --> 05:03.335
<i>  stare down one of the most</i>
<i>  intimidating machines</i>

05:03.337 --> 05:07.172
<i>  on planet earth,</i>
<i>  the brazilian bull, minotaur.</i>

05:07.174 --> 05:09.641
[cheers and applause]

05:09.643 --> 05:15.447
season six of battlebots
starts right now.
Faruq, it's your world.

05:17.451 --> 05:22.054
Ladies and gentleman,
are you ready?

05:22.056 --> 05:25.924
It's robot fighting time!

05:25.926 --> 05:28.360
[rock music playing]

[siren wailing]

05:33.834 --> 05:36.234
[cheers and applause]

05:36.236 --> 05:38.837
[faruq] in the red square,

05:38.839 --> 05:43.141
his giant blade
can chip opponents down
to a smaller height.

05:43.143 --> 05:48.146
And what he's cooking up
can give you a buzz like
his name was walter white.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.850
We all have fun
here on battlebots,
win, lose, or draw.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.486
But if you want your
opponents to be breaking bad,

05:54.488 --> 05:56.888
you better call "saw."

05:56.890 --> 06:00.892
now, say his name.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.260
[crowd] sawblaze!

06:02.262 --> 06:05.364
It's sawblaze.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.137
[chris]
<i>  here comes sawblaze,</i>

06:12.139 --> 06:15.173
<i>  led by</i>
<i>  mit madman jamison go.</i>

06:15.175 --> 06:18.143
<i>  Made the top eight</i>
<i>  in last year's tournament.</i>

06:18.145 --> 06:20.912
<i>  This team has contender</i>
<i>  written all over it,</i>

06:20.914 --> 06:22.381
<i>  kenny florian.</i>

06:22.383 --> 06:25.884
<i> [kenny] sawblaze is just</i>
<i>  a bully inside</i>
<i>  the battlebox, chris.</i>

06:25.886 --> 06:28.887
<i>  So dangerous,</i>
<i>  so well rounded.</i>

06:28.889 --> 06:32.190
<i>  Jamison go has spent</i>
<i>  thousands of hours</i>
<i>  perfecting this robot.</i>

06:32.192 --> 06:35.093
<i>  He's put an emphasis on</i>
<i>  durability this season,</i>

06:35.095 --> 06:38.296
<i>  and he expects to be the one</i>
<i>  lifting the giant nut</i>

06:38.298 --> 06:41.666
<i>  when it's all said</i>
<i>  and done here in 2021.</i>

06:42.736 --> 06:44.903
[faruq] in the blue square,

06:44.905 --> 06:49.574
this bot from greek
mythology kills from
mykonos to acropolis.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.077
He's the greatest greek
since john stamos.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.346
Like a half bull
jesse katsopolis.

06:54.348 --> 06:56.748
You've never seen
a bot this strong.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.117
He could bring
apollo to his knees,

06:59.119 --> 07:05.056
kill all of mount olympus,
making zeus call him,
"hercules! Hercules!"

07:05.058 --> 07:08.293
it's the oracle of
you die,

07:08.295 --> 07:10.462
minotaur!

[kenny]
<i>  yes, long time captain,</i>
<i>  marco meggiolaro,</i>

07:26.713 --> 07:30.015
<i>  has passed the reins on to</i>
<i>  junior de souza</i>
<i>  there on the right.</i>

07:30.017 --> 07:33.151
<i>  But marco is still watching</i>
<i>  over the team from back home</i>

07:33.153 --> 07:37.055
<i>  and minotaur</i>
<i>  has its most dangerous</i>
<i>  weapons back in the mix,</i>

07:37.057 --> 07:38.924
<i>  that horizontal drum spinner</i>

07:38.926 --> 07:42.060
<i>  and driver daniel freitas.</i>
<i>  Look out.</i>

07:42.062 --> 07:44.296
[cheers and applause]

07:51.038 --> 07:55.106
<i> [man] fight against sawblaze,</i>
<i>  we're pretty sure</i>
<i>  it'll be really tough.</i>

07:55.108 --> 07:57.676
<i>  And jamison is</i>
<i>  a really good driver,</i>

07:57.678 --> 08:00.011
<i>  and sawblaze is</i>
<i>  a really well-made bot.</i>

08:00.013 --> 08:03.315
<i>  We know</i>
<i>  it'll always be</i>
<i>  a box rushing fight.</i>

08:03.317 --> 08:06.218
<i>  They'll always try to keep us</i>
<i>  on the corners, on the walls,</i>

08:06.220 --> 08:07.686
<i>  and we'll try to avoid this.</i>

08:07.688 --> 08:10.755
<i>  Minotaur is really strong.</i>
<i>  We rely on that thing.</i>

08:10.757 --> 08:15.227
<i>  We have a really powerful</i>
<i>  drum. If we're spinning,</i>

08:15.229 --> 08:17.829
<i>  sure we're gonna have a lot</i>
<i>  of advantages against them.</i>

08:17.831 --> 08:21.867
<i>  We came here to... To</i>
<i>  get the giant nut.</i>

08:21.869 --> 08:23.935
<i> [jamison] all the changes</i>
<i>  we made to sawblaze this year</i>

08:23.937 --> 08:25.570
<i>  are focused</i>
<i>  around durability.</i>

08:25.572 --> 08:27.072
<i>  We have a new design</i>
<i>  for the forks,</i>

08:27.074 --> 08:29.307
<i>  which will</i>
<i>  hopefully take hits better</i>
<i>  and be easier to repair.</i>

08:29.309 --> 08:33.078
<i>  And we also worked on trying</i>
<i>  to make a</i>
<i>  stronger arm mechanism</i>

08:33.080 --> 08:34.779
<i>  so that</i>
<i>  we could take our own hits</i>

08:34.781 --> 08:36.948
<i>  and basically</i>
<i>  running the entire match.</i>

08:36.950 --> 08:40.218
<i>  Minotaur is known for having</i>
<i>  a massive weapon that</i>
<i>  spins incredibly fast.</i>

08:40.220 --> 08:43.288
<i>  It stores a lot of energy,</i>
<i>  and when it delivers</i>
<i>  it to its opponent,</i>

08:43.290 --> 08:45.257
<i>  they just absolutely</i>
<i>  tear them apart.</i>

08:45.259 --> 08:48.360
<i>  I think we're gonna see</i>
<i>  how this fight will go</i>
<i>  in the first ten seconds.</i>

<i>  all right, fight fans,</i>
<i>  you know, the drill by now.</i>

08:57.804 --> 09:01.006
<i>  Each battle will consist of a</i>
<i>  single three-minute bout.</i>

09:01.008 --> 09:04.943
<i>  The goal</i>
<i>  is to completely destroy</i>
<i>  or disable your opponent.</i>

09:04.945 --> 09:08.446
<i>  If you can't do that,</i>
<i>  our panel of judges</i>
<i>  will declare a victor.</i>

09:08.448 --> 09:12.250
<i>  And don't forget,</i>
<i>  the battlebox</i>
<i>  is alive with screws,</i>

09:12.252 --> 09:14.553
<i>  pulverizers,</i>
<i>  controlled by the other team,</i>

09:14.555 --> 09:18.189
<i>  and kill saws that become</i>
<i>  active in the</i>
<i>  final minute of the fight.</i>

09:18.191 --> 09:23.261
<i>  And here to provide us</i>
<i>  with the inside scoop on</i>
<i>  these matchups as we go,</i>

<i> [pete] I am so excited</i>
<i>  to be back, guys.</i>

<i>  These two teams</i>
<i>  have a combined 28</i>
<i>  battlebots wins between them.</i>

<i>  What a way</i>
<i>  to start the season.</i>

09:37.411 --> 09:39.878
<i>  I am on the edge</i>
<i>  of my seat.</i>

09:39.880 --> 09:42.180
[chris]
kenny, it's so cute
when pete gets this excited.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.982
Don't forget

09:46.153 --> 09:48.253
Okay, hold on. Where--
wait.

There's no seat belt

<i>  Good job by minotaur to</i>

11:11.838 --> 11:14.739
<i> [kenny] that move</i>
<i>  was ridiculous!</i>
<i>  Wow.</i>

11:14.741 --> 11:16.474
<i> [chris] minotaur's</i>
<i>  upside down now</i>

11:16.476 --> 11:19.644
<i>  and sawblaze is</i>
<i>  hovering with the hammer-saw.</i>

11:20.914 --> 11:23.048
<i>  Oh, my god!</i>

11:23.050 --> 11:25.717
<i> [kenny] that was a huge strike</i>
<i>  right there from sawblaze.</i>

11:25.719 --> 11:28.119
[chris]
<i>  minotaur's on fire.</i>

11:28.121 --> 11:31.056
<i>  Sawblaze taking</i>
<i>  him for a ride now and</i>
<i>  putting the brazilian</i>

11:31.058 --> 11:34.726
<i>  onto the upper deck.</i>
<i>  Are you kidding me?</i>

11:34.728 --> 11:38.029
<i> [kenny] drove up to</i>
<i>  the upper deck like</i>
<i>  it was nothing</i>

11:38.031 --> 11:40.799
<i>  unbelievable control</i>
<i>  from sawblaze there.</i>

11:40.801 --> 11:43.101
<i> [chris] the fire</i>
<i>  inside minotaur</i>

11:43.103 --> 11:46.604
<i>  continuing to grow,</i>
<i>  but somehow</i>
<i>  it's still moving around.</i>

11:46.606 --> 11:49.374
<i>  This is unbelievable, kenny.</i>

11:49.376 --> 11:53.845
<i> [kenny] this is ridiculous.</i>
<i>  Jamison go showing no signs</i>
<i>  of letting up either.</i>

11:53.847 --> 11:55.680
-Come on!
-Lock that!

11:55.682 --> 12:00.251
<i> [chris] kenny, how long can</i>
<i>  the brazilian survive with</i>
<i>  their bot on fire like this?</i>

12:00.253 --> 12:03.855
<i>  And sawblaze continuing</i>
<i>  full out attack.</i>

12:03.857 --> 12:07.225
<i> [kenny] well, it doesn't seem</i>
<i>  to have slowed</i>
<i>  them down one bit so far,</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:11.029
<i>  chris, we still have an</i>
<i>  active fight on our hands.</i>

12:11.031 --> 12:13.164
[chris]
<i>  we're almost 90 seconds in</i>

12:13.166 --> 12:16.167
<i>  in what has been</i>
<i>  a mind-blowing match</i>
<i>  to kick off the season.</i>

12:16.169 --> 12:17.836
<i>  And listen to that.</i>

12:17.838 --> 12:20.205
<i>  Minotaur's drum</i>
<i>  is still functioning.</i>

12:20.207 --> 12:24.008
<i>  Kenny, listen to the</i>
<i>  signature buzz.</i>

12:24.010 --> 12:27.912
<i> [kenny] jamison go is</i>
<i>  doing everything he can</i>
<i>  to put a nail in minotaur</i>

12:27.914 --> 12:29.214
<i>  but he can't do it.</i>

12:29.216 --> 12:32.717
<i> [chris] holy smokes.</i>
<i>  Oh!</i>

12:32.719 --> 12:35.687
<i>  Sawblaze could</i>
<i>  not kill minotaur.</i>

12:35.689 --> 12:39.190
<i> [kenny] it looks like</i>
<i>  sawblaze just snapped its</i>
<i>  weapon chain though, chris,</i>

12:39.192 --> 12:42.026
<i>  that may even things up</i>
<i>  a bit down the stretch.</i>

12:42.028 --> 12:44.996
<i>  Could this be an opening</i>
<i>  for minotaur?</i>

12:44.998 --> 12:46.164
<i> [chris] under a minute to go.</i>

12:46.166 --> 12:49.968
<i>  Can minotaur actually make it</i>
<i>  another 50 seconds?</i>

12:51.071 --> 12:54.072
<i> [kenny] oh, how about those</i>
<i>  pulverizers getting involved?</i>

12:54.074 --> 12:56.775
<i>  Sawblaze just putting</i>
<i>  it all together right now.</i>

12:56.777 --> 12:58.910
<i> [chris] what a display by</i>
<i>  sawblaze,</i>

12:58.912 --> 13:02.313
<i>  but amazing durability</i>
<i>  by the brazilian bot.</i>

13:02.315 --> 13:05.049
<i> [kenny] no question about it,</i>
<i>  and they're trying to fight.</i>

13:05.051 --> 13:08.052
<i>  They're trying to do</i>
<i>  their best, but they're</i>
<i>  stuck on those front forks</i>

13:08.054 --> 13:10.355
<i>  of sawblaze.</i>
<i>  Oh, jeez.</i>

13:10.357 --> 13:13.825
<i> [chris] look at this,</i>
<i>  delivering minotaur</i>
<i>  into the screws</i>

13:13.827 --> 13:16.161
<i>  and again</i>
<i>  on the upper deck</i>
<i>  for a second time.</i>

13:16.163 --> 13:19.664
<i> [kenny] this is just a</i>
<i>  masterclass here from</i>
<i>  jamison go right now.</i>

13:19.666 --> 13:22.634
<i> [chris] both bots</i>
<i>  seemed to have lost</i>
<i>  their primary weapons,</i>

13:22.636 --> 13:27.438
<i>  but minotaur has been on fire</i>
<i>  for full two minutes</i>
<i>  and it's gasping for air</i>

13:27.440 --> 13:30.375
<i>  in hopes of pushing</i>
<i>  this to a judges' decision.</i>

13:30.377 --> 13:32.544
<i>  This is unreal.</i>

13:32.546 --> 13:35.079
[kenny]
<i>  and they are gonna do it,</i>
<i>  chris.</i>

13:35.081 --> 13:38.316
<i>  What a performance by</i>
<i>  these veteran teams</i>
<i>  here tonight.</i>

13:38.318 --> 13:42.253
<i>  Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>  you just witnessed</i>
<i>  an instant classic.</i>

13:42.255 --> 13:43.888
[buzzer blares]

13:43.890 --> 13:46.624
[man] that's how we do it?
That's how we do it?

13:46.626 --> 13:51.196
-[man] oh! Hell yeah!
-[jamison] come on!

13:51.198 --> 13:53.064
-[chris]
<i>  how do you like that?</i>
<i> -[man] [bleep].</i>

13:53.066 --> 13:56.034
<i> [chris] two warriors giving</i>
<i>  us three minutes of mayhem</i>

13:56.036 --> 13:59.204
<i>  to kick off</i>
<i>  the season here in las vegas.</i>

13:59.206 --> 14:03.875
<i>  Team sawblaze is celebrating.</i>
<i> The fans, they're in a frenzy.</i>

14:03.877 --> 14:06.377
<i>  We got the replay,</i>
<i>  we got the decision</i>

14:06.379 --> 14:09.380
<i>  and more robot</i>
<i>  carnage when we return</i>

14:09.382 --> 14:12.016
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

14:18.325 --> 14:20.325
<i> [chris] welcome back to</i>
<i>  battlebots,</i>

14:20.327 --> 14:23.194
<i>  where sawblaze and minotaur,</i>
<i>  just kicked off</i>

14:23.196 --> 14:24.963
<i> - the 2021 season...</i>
<i> -[man] good job, guys.</i>

14:24.965 --> 14:29.167
<i> [chris] ...With an</i>
<i>  unbelievable</i>
<i>  three-minute brawl.</i>

14:29.169 --> 14:32.337
<i>  The decision will now be</i>
<i>  in the hands of the judges.</i>

14:32.339 --> 14:34.072
<i>  Lisa winter,</i>

14:34.074 --> 14:36.808
<i> derek young, and jason bardis.</i>

14:36.810 --> 14:39.244
<i>  They'll be scoring on</i>
<i>  an 11-point scale.</i>

14:39.246 --> 14:41.813
<i>  Five points</i>
<i>  can be awarded for damage,</i>

14:41.815 --> 14:45.016
<i>  three apiece for</i>
<i>  aggression and control.</i>

14:45.018 --> 14:47.886
<i>  How are they gonna</i>
<i>  break this one down, kenny?</i>

14:47.888 --> 14:52.090
<i> [kenny] well, minotaur</i>
<i>  came out swinging and</i>
<i>  landed some impressive shots,</i>

14:52.092 --> 14:55.693
<i>  racking up points</i>
<i>  in the aggression</i>
<i>  and damage categories.</i>

14:55.695 --> 14:56.794
<i>  But my goodness,</i>

14:56.796 --> 14:59.631
<i>  did sawblaze</i>
<i>  turn the tables in a hurry?</i>

14:59.633 --> 15:00.899
<i> [chris] and here's</i>
<i>  where things started</i>

15:00.901 --> 15:03.067
<i>  to get ugly</i>
<i>  for the brazilians.</i>

15:03.069 --> 15:05.970
<i> [kenny] yeah, that</i>
<i>  hammer saw cut right</i>
<i>  through to their batteries</i>

15:05.972 --> 15:07.839
<i>  and started a fire. Whoo.</i>

15:07.841 --> 15:11.209
<i>  That weapon</i>
<i>  from sawblaze, I don't think</i>
<i>  we've ever seen it</i>

15:11.211 --> 15:12.510
<i>  this devastating.</i>

15:12.512 --> 15:15.313
<i> [chris] I mean,</i>
<i>  99% of the bots</i>
<i>  out there would have been</i>

15:15.315 --> 15:16.681
<i>  finished at that point,</i>

15:16.683 --> 15:19.884
<i>  but somehow</i>
<i>  daniel freitas actually kept</i>
<i>  minotaur going,</i>

15:19.886 --> 15:22.153
<i>  even though it was</i>
<i>  completely on fire.</i>

15:22.155 --> 15:24.522
[kenny]
<i>  just miraculous stuff here</i>
<i>  for the brazilians.</i>

15:24.524 --> 15:27.859
<i>  And minotaur stuck around</i>
<i>  long enough to see sawblaze</i>

15:27.861 --> 15:31.996
<i>  pop its weapon chain,</i>
<i>  which may have evened out</i>
<i>  the scorecards a little bit.</i>

15:31.998 --> 15:34.899
<i>  I'm sure jamison go</i>
<i>  is as shocked as we are.</i>

15:34.901 --> 15:36.901
<i>  This fight didn't end</i>
<i>  in a knockout.</i>

15:36.903 --> 15:39.404
<i>  You never want to go</i>
<i>  to the judges</i>
<i>  if you can avoid it.</i>

15:39.406 --> 15:42.006
<i> [chris] here's faruq</i>
<i>  with the decision.</i>

15:43.310 --> 15:46.110
The results from
the judges are in.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.013
[cheers and applause]

15:51.952 --> 15:55.954
the winner
by unanimous decision is...

15:55.956 --> 15:59.157
-[woman] sawblaze!
-[man] sawblaze!

15:59.159 --> 16:01.659
Sawblaze!

16:01.661 --> 16:03.928
[man] let's go.

16:03.930 --> 16:07.432
[crew 1]
got it, yeah! High-fives.

16:07.434 --> 16:12.203
[crew member 2]
we are back! Whoo!

16:13.974 --> 16:17.008
Jamison go, listen to that.

16:17.010 --> 16:21.412
They are chanting your name
after the first fight of
the year, how does that feel?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.881
Uh, my name is jamison,
they're chanting
sawblaze there.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.883
[laughter]

16:25.885 --> 16:29.053
well, you certainly made
a name for yourself
yet again.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.688
-[crowd chanting]
jamison! Jamison! Jamison!
-There you go.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.124
-Whoo.
-Jamison! Jamison!

16:33.126 --> 16:37.228
Jamison, did you feel like
you were teaching
a masterclass out there?

16:37.230 --> 16:39.030
Uh, in the beginning,
did you see that?

16:39.032 --> 16:41.833
We think we were on
the, you know, back foot
there a little bit.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.701
We weren't sure that our plan
was gonna hold up,

16:43.703 --> 16:45.436
so a little bit nervous.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.339
Team minotaur is one of the
most respected teams
in the world.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.375
What does this do
for your team

16:50.377 --> 16:54.012
getting a big win like that
over a very durable bot?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.279
It's a huge confidence boost.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.448
We built a brand new
robot for this season.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.150
We worked on durability,
and it looks like

16:59.152 --> 17:02.220
after those first two hits,
we were a little shaky,
a little nervous,

17:02.222 --> 17:04.989
but the robot
got right back up
and back into the fight.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.758
I think those
upgrades paid off.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.192
Jamison, congratulations.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.362
You guys are off to
a fast start here in 2021.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.098
[man] slash and burn, baby!
Slash and burn!

17:14.100 --> 17:16.501
[cheers and applause]

17:18.638 --> 17:22.707
<i> [chris] all right.</i>
<i>  The battlebots season</i>
<i>  is now officially underway.</i>

17:22.709 --> 17:25.309
<i>  Great to see team minotaur</i>
<i>  back in the mix.</i>

17:25.311 --> 17:27.578
<i>  Not exactly the start</i>
<i>  they had in mind,</i>

17:27.580 --> 17:30.615
<i>  but the brazilians</i>
<i>  prove they are durable.</i>

17:30.617 --> 17:33.751
<i>  And the driver, daniel</i>
<i>  freitas, would sooner</i>
<i>  eat his own controller</i>

17:33.753 --> 17:36.921
<i>  than stop attacking inside</i>
<i>  of the battlebox.</i>

17:36.923 --> 17:38.756
Not all bad news
for the brazilian team.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.326
I think there's some
positive takeaways
from that fight.

17:42.328 --> 17:47.899
<i> [chris] for team sawblaze,</i>
<i>  it is off to the races with</i>
<i>  a win in their 2021 debut.</i>

17:47.901 --> 17:49.901
<i>  Every team in this</i>
<i>  year's field will fight</i>

17:49.903 --> 17:52.703
<i>  up to three times here</i>
<i>  in the qualifying rounds,</i>

17:52.705 --> 17:57.375
<i>  hoping to build a resume</i>
<i>  strong enough to earn</i>
<i>  a spot in the top 32</i>

17:57.377 --> 18:00.311
<i>  and the winner take</i>
<i>  all championship tournament.</i>

18:00.313 --> 18:03.247
<i>  May the deadliest bot win!</i>

18:03.249 --> 18:05.283
[cheers and applause]

18:05.285 --> 18:09.654
<i>  the opening night action</i>
<i>  continues right now with</i>
<i>  another marquee matchup.</i>

18:09.656 --> 18:13.257
<i>  It's uppercut</i>
<i>  versus gigabyte.</i>

18:13.259 --> 18:17.895
<i>  And let's start with a bot</i>
<i>  so powerful it could light up</i>
<i>  the las vegas strip.</i>

18:17.897 --> 18:19.397
<i>  Uppercut.</i>

18:19.632 --> 18:23.067
<i> [kenny] if you took a poll</i>
<i>  of which team</i>
<i>  has the scariest weapon,</i>

18:23.069 --> 18:26.637
<i>  I guarantee you,</i>
<i>  you'd get a lot of</i>
<i>  uppercuts as your answer.</i>

18:26.639 --> 18:29.006
<i>  Oh, my goodness!</i>

18:29.008 --> 18:33.244
<i>  That vertical spinner</i>
<i>  was handing kos out</i>
<i>  like candy last season.</i>

18:33.246 --> 18:36.814
<i>  I can't wait to see</i>
<i>  what it has in store</i>
<i>  this time around.</i>

18:36.816 --> 18:39.283
[chris]
<i>  and they're going up against</i>
<i>  team gigabyte,</i>

18:39.285 --> 18:44.222
<i>  led by electrical engineer</i>
<i>  and battlebots og,</i>
<i>  john mladenik.</i>

18:44.224 --> 18:48.292
<i>  This full-body spinner</i>
<i>  is coming off its most</i>
<i>  impressive year yet, kenny.</i>

18:48.294 --> 18:51.395
<i> [kenny] no doubt. Made it to</i>
<i>  the round of 16 last year.</i>

18:51.397 --> 18:55.766
<i>  The robot looked durable.</i>
<i>  It was able to</i>
<i>  consistently deliver damage,</i>

18:55.768 --> 18:57.802
<i>  and it solidified</i>
<i>  its reputation</i>

18:57.804 --> 19:00.872
<i> as the most exciting full-body</i>
<i>  spinner in the sport.</i>

19:00.874 --> 19:02.907
<i> [chris] oh!</i>
<i>  A master shot!</i>

19:02.909 --> 19:06.511
<i> [kenny] when gigabyte's</i>
<i>  in the mix, you know,</i>
<i>  you're in for a show.</i>

19:08.148 --> 19:11.282
<i> [chris] so let's get</i>
<i>  right to it. The teams</i>
<i>  are on the driver's deck</i>

19:11.284 --> 19:15.086
<i>  and ready for action</i>
<i>  inside the box.</i>

19:15.989 --> 19:18.990
[robotic voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

19:22.028 --> 19:26.197
<i> [chris] team uppercut</i>
<i>  from mit, led by</i>
<i>  captain alex hattori,</i>

19:26.199 --> 19:29.967
<i>  made the top 16 in their</i>
<i>  first two seasons</i>
<i>  here at battlebots.</i>

19:29.969 --> 19:33.237
<i>  They want to exceed</i>
<i>  that mark this time, kenny.</i>

19:33.239 --> 19:36.007
<i> [kenny] well, they won't be</i>
<i>  sneaking up on</i>
<i>  anyone this year, chris,</i>

19:36.009 --> 19:37.842
<i>  but that won't affect</i>
<i>  their fight strategy.</i>

19:37.844 --> 19:39.844
<i>  It goes</i>
<i>  something like this,</i>

19:39.846 --> 19:43.214
<i>  point that vertical spinner</i>
<i>  at their opponent</i>
<i>  and smash away.</i>

19:45.018 --> 19:47.151
[robotic voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

19:49.789 --> 19:51.822
<i> [chris] you know team gigabyte</i>
<i> lost a key member this season,</i>

19:51.824 --> 19:54.058
<i>  matt maxim to team cobalt.</i>

19:54.060 --> 19:57.929
<i>  But they still feel really</i>
<i>  good about their</i>
<i>  chances this season.</i>

19:57.931 --> 20:01.232
<i> [kenny] yeah, matt will be</i>
<i>  missed but john has</i>
<i>  a ton of faith in his bot.</i>

20:01.234 --> 20:04.769
<i>  He's added a 90 degree</i>
<i> lip to that shell of gigabyte,</i>

20:04.771 --> 20:06.137
<i>  in hopes of reducing recoil.</i>

20:06.139 --> 20:08.172
<i> And those three new mini bots,</i>

20:08.174 --> 20:12.210
<i> will be looking to high center</i>
<i>  uppercut and tee it up</i>
<i>  for a knockout shot.</i>

20:16.516 --> 20:18.516
[cheers and applause]

20:31.965 --> 20:37.802
<i> [chris] uppercut, gigabyte,</i>
<i>  prepare for weapon</i>
<i>  on weapon warfare.</i>

20:37.804 --> 20:40.771
[crowd chanting]
fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

20:40.773 --> 20:42.974
<i>  Let the bot battle begin.</i>

20:42.976 --> 20:45.343
<i>  Gigabyte</i>
<i>  needs to keep the action</i>
<i>  in the center of the box,</i>

20:45.345 --> 20:47.078
<i>  but uppercut's all over him,</i>

20:47.080 --> 20:48.980
<i>  delivers a clean shot there.</i>

20:48.982 --> 20:50.648
<i> [kenny] oh!</i>

20:51.184 --> 20:54.318
<i> [chris] and another. Uppercut</i>
<i>  has him sealed off</i>
<i>  of that short corner now.</i>

20:54.320 --> 20:57.588
<i> [kenny] this is not what</i>
<i>  gigabyte wanted.</i>

20:57.590 --> 21:00.958
<i> [chris] whoa! Uppercut</i>
<i>  with a huge pop,</i>
<i>  but it's up on its dome.</i>

21:00.960 --> 21:04.829
<i>  Gigabyte's got to find</i>
<i>  a way to get out of this</i>
<i>  corner, kenny, and now.</i>

21:04.831 --> 21:05.963
<i> [kenny] they sure do,</i>
<i>  but looks like</i>

21:05.965 --> 21:08.766
<i>  they may be trying to box</i>
<i>  uppercut in now.</i>

21:08.768 --> 21:12.503
<i>  Probably should have used</i>
<i>  the escape hatch</i>
<i>  while they had it.</i>

21:12.505 --> 21:16.974
<i> [chris] oh, big shot.</i>
<i>  Gigabyte's on its head</i>
<i>  but self-rights.</i>

21:16.976 --> 21:18.909
[crowd exclaiming]

21:18.911 --> 21:20.244
<i> [kenny] my goodness!</i>

21:20.280 --> 21:23.648
<i> [chris] both bots</i>
<i>  seeing stars, and</i>
<i>  here comes uppercut.</i>

21:25.285 --> 21:28.252
<i>  That weapon is devastating.</i>

21:28.254 --> 21:30.788
<i>  Gigabyte back on its head.</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:32.690
<i>  John mladenik is</i>
<i>  not sure what hit him,</i>

21:32.692 --> 21:35.159
<i>  but the answer is</i>
<i>  young alex hattori's</i>

21:35.161 --> 21:39.163
<i> - vertical spinner, and</i>
<i>  here comes the countdown.</i>
<i> -[referee] ten, nine, eight,</i>

21:39.165 --> 21:41.966
-[referee] seven, six...
<i> -[kenny] wow.</i>
<i>  Both of these</i>

21:41.968 --> 21:44.101
<i>  bots are gonna need</i>
<i>  some smelling salts</i>

21:44.103 --> 21:45.836
<i>  after this one, chris.</i>

21:45.838 --> 21:48.906
[referee]
<i>  two, one. Knockout!</i>

21:48.908 --> 21:51.275
[knockout buzzer]

21:52.478 --> 21:57.615
<i> [chris] what an impressive</i>
<i>  2021 debut for</i>
<i>  team uppercut.</i>

22:00.153 --> 22:02.953
<i>  All right, kenny,</i>
<i>  break it all down for us.</i>

22:02.955 --> 22:05.556
[kenny]
<i>  well, for the second time</i>
<i>  in as many fights, chris,</i>

22:05.558 --> 22:08.025
<i>  we saw the upper deck</i>
<i>  come into play here.</i>

22:08.027 --> 22:11.829
<i>  John mladenik needed</i>
<i>  to keep gigabyte</i>
<i>  in the center of the box</i>

22:11.831 --> 22:14.131
<i>  and give himself</i>
<i>  the space to spin up.</i>

22:14.133 --> 22:16.634
<i>  But uppercut was able</i>
<i>  to back gigabyte down</i>

22:16.636 --> 22:19.770
<i>  into that new 16x8</i>
<i>  foot short corner.</i>

22:19.772 --> 22:23.074
<i>  And that is a dangerous place</i>
<i>  to be if you're a</i>
<i>  full-body spinner.</i>

22:23.076 --> 22:25.576
<i> [chris] yeah, you thought</i>
<i>  maybe there was</i>
<i>  one opportunity</i>

22:25.578 --> 22:27.078
<i>  and he could have</i>
<i>  pulled back to the center</i>

22:27.080 --> 22:30.181
<i> and for some reason he didn't,</i>
<i>  and that was a fatal mistake.</i>

22:30.183 --> 22:32.783
<i> [kenny] yeah, once</i>
<i>  uppercut boxed</i>
<i>  gigabyte into that corner</i>

22:32.785 --> 22:33.918
<i>  for the second time,</i>

22:33.953 --> 22:36.620
<i>  they just went nuclear</i>
<i>  with that vertical spinner.</i>

22:36.622 --> 22:39.757
<i>  Gigabyte</i>
<i>  lost its self-righter with</i>
<i>  that shot right there,</i>

22:39.759 --> 22:42.360
<i>  landed on its head</i>
<i>  and it was lights out.</i>

22:42.362 --> 22:45.629
<i> [chris] uppercut,</i>
<i>  one scary robot.</i>

22:45.631 --> 22:47.298
[cheers and applause]

22:47.300 --> 22:51.702
alex hattori, I imagine
that's the way you drew it
up back in the pits, huh?

22:51.704 --> 22:54.939
-No way, that was...
...That was very intense.
-No?

22:54.941 --> 22:58.142
That was... Those were
bigger hits than we expected.
That was...

22:59.612 --> 23:01.178
It's a relief
that it's over.

23:02.615 --> 23:06.150
Why do you continue
to surprise yourself with the
power of that weapon?

23:06.152 --> 23:09.253
You know, we don't get
to test uppercut except
for when we're here, so

23:09.255 --> 23:11.288
this is the first time
we've been able to spin up

23:11.290 --> 23:14.392
and hit anything with this
new version of uppercut, so.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.326
What are you saying,
that you don't

23:15.328 --> 23:17.027
just roll down
the street where you live and

23:17.029 --> 23:19.296
just test uppercut
wherever on the sidewalk?

23:19.298 --> 23:22.533
Sadly, no. Our neighbors
wouldn't really like that.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.236
Can you win the
giant nut this year, alex?

23:25.238 --> 23:27.938
We certainly hope so,
we'll do our best.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.941
Alex,
can you win the giant nut?

23:30.943 --> 23:33.110
I think those hits
speak for themselves,
so I don't have to.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.913
Exactly. That is the answer
we're looking for.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.450
-Alex hattori, team uppercut.
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.656
Kenny, I imagine the
entire pitch back there,

23:45.658 --> 23:49.593
you have been warned.
Uppercut was nasty in 2020.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.062
<i>  They are scarier in 2021.</i>

23:52.965 --> 23:57.201
<i> [chris] okay, when we return,</i>
<i>  a newcomer jumps into the mix</i>

23:57.203 --> 24:03.207
<i>  as switchback makes its</i>
<i>  debut against the infamous</i>
<i>  flame thrower of gruff.</i>

24:03.209 --> 24:07.144
<i>  That's next on battlebots.</i>

24:16.289 --> 24:21.125
We are back on
battlebots, where
sparks fly and robots die.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.893
<i>  One of the great joys</i>
<i>  of a new season</i>

24:22.895 --> 24:25.329
<i>  is introducing</i>
<i>  the rookies in our field.</i>

24:25.331 --> 24:28.632
<i>  Could a future battlebots</i>
<i>  champion be</i>
<i>  lurking among them?</i>

24:28.634 --> 24:29.967
<i>  You never know.</i>

24:29.969 --> 24:32.770
<i>  Let's meet the newcomer</i>
<i>  in our next matchup,</i>

24:32.772 --> 24:34.505
<i>  switchback.</i>

24:39.745 --> 24:42.913
<i> [greg] my name is greg needel,</i>
<i>  and I'm team captain</i>
<i>  of team switchback.</i>

24:42.915 --> 24:44.081
<i>  It's our first year</i>
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

24:44.083 --> 24:45.216
<i>  We're happy to be here,</i>

24:45.218 --> 24:46.584
<i>  and we're from dallas, texas.</i>

24:47.954 --> 24:49.320
<i>  Switchback is a</i>

24:49.322 --> 24:51.856
<i>  brand new robot,</i>
<i>  a variable drum spinner</i>

24:51.858 --> 24:54.124
on a 180 degree
articulating arm.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.230
<i> [greg] we always wanna</i>
<i>  do something different.</i>

24:59.232 --> 25:01.031
<i>  It was a lot of give and</i>
<i>  take at the very beginning,</i>

25:01.033 --> 25:03.634
<i>  but the idea was, could we</i>

25:03.636 --> 25:07.438
<i>  take the heaviest drum,</i>
<i>  the fastest it can go</i>

25:07.440 --> 25:08.906
<i>  and move that thing around,</i>

25:08.908 --> 25:11.175
<i>  but it's got that</i>
<i>  same killer force</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:13.677
<i>  as some of the other biggest</i>
<i>  drum spinners in the field</i>

25:13.679 --> 25:16.013
and switchback was born.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.283
<i>  Switchback can run</i>
<i>  a full 80-pound drum</i>

25:19.285 --> 25:21.151
<i>  up to the maximum</i>
<i>  limit of battlebots</i>

25:21.153 --> 25:23.053
<i>  at 250 miles an hour</i>
<i>  tip speed,</i>

25:23.055 --> 25:24.855
<i>  that's our maximum</i>
<i>  configuration.</i>

25:24.857 --> 25:26.857
We've still got
some little stuff we
have to take care of,

25:26.859 --> 25:28.893
but we feel pretty good.

25:28.895 --> 25:32.029
<i>  Feels really amazing to</i>
<i>  come in as a new team,</i>

25:32.031 --> 25:34.031
<i>  and then here</i>
<i>  in the pit to see like,</i>

25:34.033 --> 25:35.866
<i>  so many of these</i>
<i>  veteran teams,</i>

25:35.868 --> 25:37.067
<i>  especially when you're like,</i>

25:37.069 --> 25:40.070
yeah, like I... I... I kind
of wanna smash that robot.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.874
<i>  We went into battlebots</i>
<i>  knowing that</i>

25:43.876 --> 25:46.744
<i>  success for us was kind</i>
<i>  of defined by the journey.</i>

25:46.746 --> 25:48.178
<i>  A group of friends,</i>
<i>  we got together,</i>

25:48.414 --> 25:51.382
<i>  we built this cool</i>
<i>  machine, we wanted to</i>
<i>  come to battlebots.</i>

25:51.384 --> 25:52.616
I mean, this is a dream.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.053
<i> [chris] you know,</i>
<i>  making the leap</i>

25:56.055 --> 25:57.621
<i>  to the big leagues</i>
<i>  here at battlebots</i>

25:57.623 --> 26:00.224
<i>  is no easy task,</i>
<i>  but greg needel</i>

26:00.226 --> 26:02.860
<i>  seems up for the challenge.</i>

26:02.862 --> 26:03.994
Kenny, we spoke with him,

26:03.996 --> 26:06.897
I've never seen a rookie
team more prepared.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.999
Absolutely. And
it seems like he has

26:09.001 --> 26:11.001
the preparation
of a veteran

26:11.003 --> 26:13.837
but the humility of a
rookie, you know, I've
been really impressed with

26:13.839 --> 26:14.838
what he's been saying.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.273
He's doing a
bunch of studying,

26:16.275 --> 26:19.176
a videotape, so he is
very well-prepared.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.012
That's right. He has watched
each and every fight

26:22.014 --> 26:23.847
of his opponent tonight,
gruff.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.549
Faruq, it's your world.

26:26.986 --> 26:30.854
In the red square, from
dallas, texas,

26:30.856 --> 26:34.291
don't mess with
texas or he'll eat you
for breakfast.

26:34.293 --> 26:38.128
Give it up for switchback.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.397
<i>  [cheers and applause]</i>

26:43.302 --> 26:44.902
[chris]
<i>  here's our first live look</i>

26:44.904 --> 26:46.604
<i>  at the rookie switchback.</i>

26:46.606 --> 26:50.174
<i>  Kenny, this thing</i>
<i>  is coming in with a</i>
<i>  one-of-a-kind weapon.</i>

26:50.176 --> 26:54.011
<i> [kenny] that's right.</i>
<i>  Greg needel calls it</i>
<i>  a sandwich drum spinner.</i>

26:54.013 --> 26:56.146
<i>  It features a varying</i>
<i>  configuration</i>

26:56.148 --> 26:59.717
<i>  of 6.5 pounds</i>
<i>  of ar 500 discs,</i>

26:59.719 --> 27:03.253
<i>  all on a 180-degree</i>
<i>  articulating arm</i>

27:03.255 --> 27:06.256
<i>  that allows it to attack</i>
<i>  from above or head on.</i>

27:08.327 --> 27:10.327
[faruq] in the blue square,

27:10.329 --> 27:12.196
from palm harbor, florida,

27:12.198 --> 27:15.466
it breathes fire and
has giant forks.

27:15.468 --> 27:18.135
Now it's time for a barbecue.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.971
Give it up for gruff!

27:20.973 --> 27:23.307
[cheers and applause]

27:26.178 --> 27:29.013
<i> [chris] and here comes the</i>
<i>  fire spitting veterans from</i>

27:29.015 --> 27:30.180
<i>  team gruff.</i>

27:30.182 --> 27:31.815
<i>  Third year here</i>
<i>  at battlebots.</i>

27:31.817 --> 27:35.886
<i>  This robot might</i>
<i>  just be the toughest</i>
<i>  one in the entire field.</i>

27:35.888 --> 27:38.989
<i> [kenny] gruff is armored</i>
<i>  like a tank, chris.</i>

27:38.991 --> 27:41.692
<i>  Plus, it features the</i>
<i>  hottest burning</i>
<i>  flamethrower</i>

27:41.694 --> 27:43.093
<i>  in the competition.</i>

27:43.095 --> 27:44.795
<i>  They've shifted some</i>
<i>  weight from the lifter</i>

27:44.797 --> 27:47.631
<i>  into a redesigned</i>
<i>  drive train this season,</i>

27:47.633 --> 27:51.335
<i>  so look out for some</i>
<i>  improved mobility from</i>
<i>  them here tonight.</i>

27:52.972 --> 27:55.105
[cheers and applause]

27:57.977 --> 28:00.811
<i>  we're taking</i>
<i>  every single fight</i>
<i>  one at a time, right?</i>

28:00.813 --> 28:03.681
<i>  With a brand</i>
<i>  new concept and a</i>
<i>  brand new robot,</i>

28:03.683 --> 28:06.016
<i>  we'd love to go far</i>
<i>  in the tournament,</i>
<i>  but we've gotta</i>

28:06.018 --> 28:08.085
<i>  focus on the match</i>
<i>  ahead of us right now.</i>

28:08.087 --> 28:09.687
<i>  We're preparing for gruff.</i>

28:09.689 --> 28:11.955
<i>  We're putting an armor</i>
<i>  package on together</i>

28:11.957 --> 28:13.590
<i>  and a weapon package</i>
<i>  that we think will be</i>

28:13.592 --> 28:15.192
<i>  good against them.</i>

28:15.194 --> 28:17.995
<i>  We're up to the challenge</i>
<i>  for anything that anybody</i>
<i>  throws at us.</i>

28:17.997 --> 28:20.264
<i>  Last year, we</i>
<i>  struggled with our</i>
<i>  drivetrain self-destructing.</i>

28:20.266 --> 28:21.398
<i>  This year,</i>

28:21.400 --> 28:22.933
<i>  uh, we've got</i>
<i>  these gearboxes,</i>

28:22.935 --> 28:24.702
<i>  that are designed to</i>

28:24.704 --> 28:26.937
<i>  basically bring back</i>
<i>  our old reliability.</i>

28:26.939 --> 28:29.006
<i>  So going up against</i>
<i>  switchback, we're a little</i>
<i>  bit nervous 'cause</i>

28:29.008 --> 28:32.276
<i>  we've got tons of armor</i>
<i>  all around the sides,</i>

28:32.278 --> 28:35.045
<i>  uh, but our top and bottom</i>
<i>  armor is pretty limited.</i>

28:35.047 --> 28:37.014
<i>  And so if they can bring that</i>

28:37.016 --> 28:40.417
<i>  blade down on top of us,</i>
<i>  we're a little bit worried</i>
<i>  about that.</i>

28:40.419 --> 28:43.153
<i>  We run into them until</i>
<i>  something breaks.</i>
<i>  Hopefully it's them.</i>

28:48.961 --> 28:51.128
[robotic voice]
<i>  robots activate.</i>

28:51.130 --> 28:52.796
[cheers and applause]

28:52.798 --> 28:56.100
<i> [chris] uh-oh, there is that</i>
<i>  flame from gruff.</i>

28:56.102 --> 28:57.968
<i>  And for more on</i>
<i>  grump's opponent,</i>

28:57.970 --> 29:00.938
<i>  we welcome in</i>
<i>  our bot whisperer,</i>
<i>  pete, who has props.</i>

29:00.940 --> 29:02.106
I do, guys.

29:02.108 --> 29:05.375
Check this out.
This is one of the discs
from switchback.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.412
<i>  They plan on</i>
<i>  staggering these</i>
<i>  at a certain distance</i>

29:08.414 --> 29:10.347
<i>  so that gruff's forks</i>

29:10.349 --> 29:13.917
<i>  do not get hung</i>
<i>  up in between each one</i>
<i>  of these things,</i>

29:13.919 --> 29:16.286
<i>  that they can easily</i>
<i>  slide off of the forks.</i>

29:16.288 --> 29:18.689
But it's like you said,
it's a brand new bot.

29:18.691 --> 29:21.892
It's a completely
different design that we've
never seen before,

29:21.894 --> 29:24.261
<i>  and I'm super excited to</i>
<i>  watch it happen.</i>

29:30.936 --> 29:34.905

29:34.907 --> 29:40.144

29:46.986 --> 29:49.620

<i>  quick on the draw,</i>

29:57.062 --> 29:59.363
<i>  gets behind the</i>

<i>  Oh, nice shot on the</i>

30:03.936 --> 30:07.171
<i>  Oh! Switchback's weapon</i>
<i>  up to full speed</i>

30:07.173 --> 30:11.141
<i>  but there's mr. Durability</i>
<i>  gruff backing it down.</i>

30:11.143 --> 30:14.645
<i> Uh-oh, gruff under the rookie,</i>
<i>  up against the rails.</i>

30:14.647 --> 30:16.013
<i>  Ohhh! Nice pop.</i>

30:16.015 --> 30:18.749
[kenny]
<i>  a bit of inexperience from</i>
<i>  the rookies there, chris.</i>

<i>  Not throttling that</i>
<i>  weapon down when</i>
<i>  gruff had them pinned.</i>

<i>  get caught</i>
<i>  in the kill saw there.</i>

30:25.758 --> 30:29.660
<i>  They're staying aggressive.</i>
<i>  But they need to be</i>
<i>  smart and pick their spots.</i>

30:31.030 --> 30:32.896
<i> [chris] no question,</i>
<i>  switchback's weapon,</i>

30:32.898 --> 30:35.332
<i>  very functional,</i>
<i>  very impressive.</i>

30:35.334 --> 30:38.936
<i>  The question is,</i>
<i>  can it get the angle</i>
<i>  on gruff it wants? Oh!</i>

30:38.938 --> 30:40.838
<i>  A one-two shot from</i>
<i>  switchback.</i>

30:40.840 --> 30:44.141
[kenny]
<i>  switchback keeps going</i>
<i>  nose to nose with gruff.</i>

30:44.143 --> 30:47.411
<i>  And that is not what you</i>
<i>  want to do, especially</i>
<i>  against those forks.</i>

30:47.413 --> 30:49.880
[chris]
<i>  a masterful job by</i>
<i>  gruff of delivering</i>

30:49.915 --> 30:51.949
<i>  switchbacks into</i>
<i>  a pulverizer.</i>

30:51.951 --> 30:54.218
<i>  Incredible control</i>
<i>  there, kenny.</i>

30:54.220 --> 30:58.222
<i> [kenny] absolutely, that</i>
<i>  should play very well</i>
<i>  with the judges.</i>

30:58.224 --> 31:01.625
[chris]
<i>  and now he's literally got</i>
<i>  switchback cornered.</i>

31:01.627 --> 31:02.893
<i> [kenny] this is</i>
<i>  where gruff shines.</i>

31:02.895 --> 31:04.728
<i>  This is where he makes</i>
<i>  his money right here,</i>

31:04.730 --> 31:07.631
<i>  just staying on his</i>
<i>  opponent.</i>

31:07.633 --> 31:10.634
<i> [chris] oh, another bit</i>
<i>  of incredible control</i>
<i>  there by gruff,</i>

31:10.636 --> 31:14.004
<i>  landing another shot</i>
<i>  with the pulverizer.</i>

31:14.006 --> 31:18.008
<i> [kenny] look out,</i>
<i>  switchback's weapon up to</i>
<i>  full speed again, chris.</i>

31:18.744 --> 31:21.245
<i> -[kenny] oh!</i>
<i> -[chris] oh!</i>

31:21.247 --> 31:24.681
<i> [chris] huge impact there,</i>
<i>  and now switchback</i>
<i>  is on its head.</i>

31:24.683 --> 31:28.352
<i>  Can it self-right?</i>
<i>  Here comes gruff!</i>

31:28.354 --> 31:32.022
<i>  Oh! Switchback lining</i>
<i>  up a knockout blow</i>

31:32.024 --> 31:33.523
<i>  and it knocked itself out.</i>

31:33.525 --> 31:36.827
<i>  And now greg needel's</i>
<i>  robot is getting</i>
<i>  flambéed inside the box.</i>

31:36.829 --> 31:38.929
[referee] you guys, it's not
moving, guys. We're gonna
have to count down.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.697
<i> [chris] the ref is</i>
<i> issuing a warning.</i>

31:40.699 --> 31:44.001
-[referee] ten, night eight...
<i> -[chris] switchback, can't it</i>
<i> get itself right side up.</i>

31:44.003 --> 31:46.637
<i> - And it's gonna be on the</i>
<i>  wrong side of the ledger...</i>
<i> -Seven, six, five...</i>

31:46.639 --> 31:49.973
- Here in its battlebots
<i> debut. -[referee] four,</i>
<i> three, two...</i>

31:50.009 --> 31:52.943
One!
That's a knockout.
Winner, gruff!

31:52.945 --> 31:56.313
[dramatic music playing]

31:57.182 --> 31:59.983
[cheers and applause]

32:02.421 --> 32:06.256
[chris]
<i>  and that's what you</i>
<i>  call baptism by fire.</i>

32:10.829 --> 32:12.029
<i>  Kenny,</i>
<i>  I gotta tell you</i>

32:12.031 --> 32:14.865
<i>  the rookie looked impressive</i>
<i>  right out of the gate.</i>

32:14.867 --> 32:17.668
<i> [kenny] listen, switchback</i>
<i>  showed some promise</i>
<i>  in this fight.</i>

32:17.670 --> 32:19.870
<i>  That drum spinner is legit.</i>

32:19.872 --> 32:22.272
<i>  The question is whether</i>
<i>  or not that articulating arm</i>

32:22.274 --> 32:23.273
<i>  is fast enough</i>

32:23.275 --> 32:25.742
<i>  to be effective in</i>
<i>  attacking from above.</i>

32:25.744 --> 32:28.979
<i>  Something to look out</i>
<i>  for in their coming</i>
<i>  matches.</i>

32:28.981 --> 32:32.015
<i> [chris] and what a display</i>
<i>  of control from gruff.</i>

32:32.017 --> 32:33.951
<i>  [kenny]</i>
<i>  gruff had it all working</i>
<i>  in this fight.</i>

32:33.953 --> 32:36.620
<i>  They were durable enough</i>
<i>  to take some punishment,</i>

32:36.622 --> 32:38.989
<i>  and they used that improved</i>
<i>  drive train</i>

32:38.991 --> 32:41.191
<i>  to push switchback</i>
<i>  around the box</i>

32:41.193 --> 32:43.060
<i>  and deliver it</i>
<i>  into the hazards.</i>

32:43.062 --> 32:45.896
<i> [chris] and how about a</i>
<i>  little flamage from gruff</i>

32:45.898 --> 32:47.998
<i>  to seal the deal.</i>

32:51.337 --> 32:54.237
<i>  So with that, sam mcamis</i>
<i>  and team gruff</i>

32:54.239 --> 32:56.606
<i>  start their season</i>
<i>  off with a victory.</i>

32:56.608 --> 33:01.611
<i>  And for rookie</i>
<i>  greg needel and switchback,</i>
<i>  an excellent first showing.</i>

33:01.613 --> 33:02.913
<i>  They came in prepared,</i>

33:02.915 --> 33:04.314
<i>  but nothing can simulate</i>

33:04.316 --> 33:06.483
<i>  the ferocious flame of gruff</i>

33:06.485 --> 33:10.087
<i>  or the pressure</i>
<i>  of the battlebox.</i>

33:11.023 --> 33:12.022
<i>  Coming up next,</i>

33:12.024 --> 33:15.258
<i>  the grim reaper</i>
<i>  himself, mr. Ray billings,</i>

33:15.260 --> 33:20.197
<i>  marches tombstone</i>
<i>  into the arena to face</i>
<i>  captain shrederator.</i>

33:20.199 --> 33:21.865
<i> And make sure your tray tables</i>

33:21.867 --> 33:24.134
<i>  are in their upright</i>
<i>  and locked position</i>

33:24.136 --> 33:25.702
<i>  because later tonight,</i>

33:25.704 --> 33:27.604
<i>  the defending champs,</i>

33:27.606 --> 33:31.808
<i>  end game, will dance</i>
<i>  with the baddest flipper</i>
<i>  on the planet,</i>

33:31.810 --> 33:35.345
<i>  last year's number one</i>
<i>  tournament seed hydra.</i>

33:35.347 --> 33:38.148
<i>  Don't go anywhere.</i>

33:45.024 --> 33:47.290
[chris]
<i>  welcome back to battlebots,</i>
<i>  the world's premier</i>

33:47.292 --> 33:49.860
robot fighting competition.

33:49.862 --> 33:50.861
<i>  We're only</i>
<i>  three matches</i>

33:50.863 --> 33:53.096
<i>  into the 2021 season,</i>

33:53.098 --> 33:55.399
<i>  and that's longer</i>
<i>  than we're used to,</i>
<i>  waiting for the most</i>

33:55.401 --> 33:59.202
<i>  recognizable face in</i>
<i>  all of robot combat,</i>

33:59.204 --> 34:02.005
<i>  the king of kinetic energy,</i>

34:02.007 --> 34:05.809
<i>  former champ ray billings</i>
<i>  and tombstone.</i>

34:05.811 --> 34:10.113
<i>  Kenny, just how much</i>
<i>  fear does ray still strike</i>
<i>  into his opponents?</i>

34:10.115 --> 34:12.649
[kenny]
<i>  I mean, I get chills</i>
<i>  hearing you say that name,</i>

34:12.651 --> 34:13.984
<i>  so imagine what it feels like</i>

34:13.986 --> 34:15.419
<i>  going up against him.</i>

34:15.421 --> 34:18.822
<i>  Ray told us he was</i>
<i>  frustrated with his up</i>
<i>  and down performance</i>

34:18.824 --> 34:20.190
<i>  in last year's qualifiers.</i>

34:20.192 --> 34:22.025
<i>  He let that anger fuel him,</i>

34:22.027 --> 34:23.894
<i>  and he's redesigned tombstone</i>

34:23.896 --> 34:26.196
<i>  to be the most powerful</i>
<i>  version of the bot</i>

34:26.198 --> 34:28.965
<i>  the field has ever seen.</i>
<i>  Truly terrifying.</i>

34:28.967 --> 34:31.234
[chris]
<i>  well, he'll be going up</i>
<i>  against a bot we know</i>

34:31.236 --> 34:32.969
<i>  oh-so well.</i>

34:32.971 --> 34:35.305
<i>  Mr. Red, white,</i>
<i>  and blue himself.</i>

34:35.307 --> 34:38.442
<i>  Brian nave and</i>
<i>  captain shrederator.</i>

34:38.444 --> 34:40.010
<i>  Kenny, there's</i>
<i>  never a dull moment</i>

34:40.012 --> 34:42.946
<i>  when this full-body</i>
<i>  spinner is in the mix.</i>

34:42.948 --> 34:45.248
[kenny]
<i>  absolutely. Brian</i>
<i>  knows how to put on a show.</i>

34:45.250 --> 34:47.184
<i>  And coming into</i>
<i>  tonight's matchup,</i>

34:47.186 --> 34:50.287
<i>  he's not only</i>
<i>  armed with an improved</i>
<i>  captain shrederator,</i>

34:50.289 --> 34:53.824
<i>  but the drive to</i>
<i>  take it to one of his</i>
<i>  oldest friends in the sport</i>

34:53.826 --> 34:55.125
<i>  in ray billings.</i>

34:55.127 --> 34:57.394
<i>  I know in my career</i>
<i>  I always had an extra gear</i>

34:57.396 --> 34:59.062
<i>  for the fights against</i>
<i>  competitors</i>

34:59.064 --> 35:00.630
<i>  I had a relationship with,</i>

35:00.632 --> 35:03.333
<i>  and I can guarantee it's</i>
<i>  no different for brian</i>

35:03.335 --> 35:05.168
<i>  taking on ray here tonight.</i>

35:06.138 --> 35:08.638
It's gonna be fun.
Faruq, take it away

35:13.112 --> 35:15.312
[faruq] in the red square,

35:15.314 --> 35:18.148
this bot is a captain
like james t. Kirk,

35:18.150 --> 35:20.283
and he's setting his
phasers from stun

35:20.285 --> 35:21.618
to murder.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.987
When he takes the helm
and comes for you,

35:23.989 --> 35:25.956
you'll want to
hide and cower.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.224
Wanna fight him?

35:27.226 --> 35:28.625
That's illogical.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.828
You don't have the power.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.264
Boldly going into
the battlebox,

35:34.266 --> 35:38.135
it's captain shrederator.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.770
[dramatic music playing]

35:40.772 --> 35:43.406
[cheers and applause]

35:43.408 --> 35:46.143
<i> [chris] one of the most</i>
<i>  recognizable robots</i>
<i>  in the field,</i>

35:54.620 --> 35:55.785
<i>  Tell us about it.</i>

35:55.787 --> 35:57.220
<i> [kenny] well,</i>
<i>  shrederator's struggles with</i>

35:57.222 --> 36:00.891
<i>  weapon durability</i>
<i>  are well documented,</i>
<i>  so brian and his team</i>

36:00.893 --> 36:02.726
<i>  have added a</i>
<i>  second weapon motor</i>

36:02.728 --> 36:04.361
<i>  for redundancy this season.</i>

36:04.363 --> 36:06.897
<i>  They're gonna</i>
<i>  get a shock test right</i>
<i>  out of the gate here</i>

36:06.899 --> 36:08.465
<i>  against tombstone,</i>

36:08.467 --> 36:11.268
<i>  and they'll need</i>
<i>  to make sure shred</i>
<i>  keep spinning</i>

36:11.270 --> 36:14.304
<i>  if they want</i>
<i>  any shot at taking</i>
<i>  down the legend.</i>

36:14.306 --> 36:16.106
[faruq] in the blue square,

36:16.108 --> 36:18.141
prepare to die hard.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.110
And if you're asking
who's the illest,

36:20.112 --> 36:22.179
know this bot is unbreakable

36:22.181 --> 36:24.247
like its name was
bruce willis.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.815
Remember the sixth sense?

36:25.817 --> 36:27.150
Well, that ending applies

36:27.152 --> 36:29.186
'cause after you
lose this fight,

36:29.188 --> 36:34.024
you'll realize, "I was
dead the whole time."

36:34.026 --> 36:35.225
spoiler alert!

36:35.227 --> 36:36.259
Give it up

<i>  as team tombstone</i>

<i>  feared teams in</i>
<i>  battlebots history.</i>

37:00.052 --> 37:01.952
<i> [kenny] yeah, and the most</i>
<i>  impressive part is</i>

37:01.954 --> 37:04.387
<i>  how they managed to</i>
<i>  bring a contender to the box</i>

37:04.389 --> 37:06.022
<i>  year after year.</i>

37:06.024 --> 37:07.557
<i>  Ray and his team told us that</i>

37:07.559 --> 37:09.960
<i>  not only have they</i>
<i>  installed a brand new</i>

37:09.962 --> 37:13.630
<i>  weldless unibody frame</i>
<i>  that absorbs impacts</i>
<i>  better than ever,</i>

37:13.632 --> 37:16.600
<i>  they've also turbocharged</i>
<i>  their punching power</i>

37:16.602 --> 37:18.301
<i>  with brand new weapon motors</i>

37:18.303 --> 37:22.539
<i>  that are sure to</i>
<i>  send even the bravest of</i>
<i>  bots running for cover.</i>

37:28.247 --> 37:30.747
<i>  This year, tombstone's</i>
<i>  been upgraded a lot.</i>

37:30.749 --> 37:32.749
We made some changes
to the... The...

37:32.751 --> 37:35.318
The weapon motor itself,
and to the power system,

37:35.320 --> 37:37.854
we have a lot more power
than we did before.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.155
The only part that's scary
is we made a

37:39.157 --> 37:41.191
whole bunch of
changes all at once,

37:41.193 --> 37:43.927
so we gotta make
sure that it's all working
when we get in the arena.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.328
I like our chances.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.997
I think it's a, it's
a match we're...
We're going to win.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.632
It's gonna be a good one.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.901
There... There's a lot of
energy being unleashed in
that arena this time.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.036
You know, being back here,

37:53.038 --> 37:54.337
the excitement is
just in the air

37:54.339 --> 37:56.206
and just walking
into the building

37:56.208 --> 37:58.241
just like, boom,
makes you excited.

37:58.243 --> 38:00.877
And now, we get to
fight a legend.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.380
I've been asking for a
tombstone fight for years.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.081
You know, if he wins,
everybody is gonna go,

38:05.083 --> 38:06.149
"oh, yeah, of course,
he'll win."

38:06.151 --> 38:07.884
he loses, everybody
is gonna go,

38:07.886 --> 38:10.253
"you lost to
captain shrederator?
Come on!"

38:10.255 --> 38:13.056
the fights are, uh, rock,
paper, scissors, right?

38:13.859 --> 38:15.959
Well, we're the rock
to his scissors.

<i>  tombstone at full speed now.</i>

39:58.330 --> 40:00.096
[crowd exclaiming]

40:00.098 --> 40:02.132
<i> what the heck was that, kenny?</i>

40:02.134 --> 40:05.101
[kenny]
<i>  I think a tooth just flew</i>
<i>  off of shrederator.</i>

40:05.103 --> 40:07.237
-Wow.
<i> -[chris] a huge impact,</i>

40:07.239 --> 40:10.974
<i>  and don't look now, but</i>
<i>  tombstone is wobbling.</i>

40:10.976 --> 40:14.043
<i>  Oh, it's leaking out of</i>
<i>  the top of the robot as well.</i>

40:14.045 --> 40:16.045
<i>  Oh! What a shot.</i>

40:16.047 --> 40:19.449
<i>  Shrederator going</i>
<i>  weapon to weapon</i>
<i>  with tombstone.</i>

40:19.451 --> 40:22.252
<i>  -Can you believe it?</i>
<i> -[kenny] whoa, he's on fire.</i>

40:22.254 --> 40:23.319
<i> [chris] oh!</i>

40:23.321 --> 40:25.021
<i>  A huge hit.</i>

40:25.023 --> 40:26.856
<i>  [kenny] oh, my goodness!</i>

40:26.858 --> 40:30.660
<i> [chris] and tombstone's</i>
<i>  weapon is no longer</i>
<i>  spinning, kenny.</i>

40:30.662 --> 40:32.829
[kenny]
<i>  yeah, that blade may</i>
<i>  be out of commission,</i>

40:32.831 --> 40:37.734
<i>  and ray billings is</i>
<i>  dealing with a serious</i>
<i>  fire inside tombstone.</i>

40:37.736 --> 40:40.737
<i> [chris] and now</i>
<i>  captain shrederator is no</i>
<i>  longer spinning as well,</i>

40:40.739 --> 40:45.775
<i>  but, kenny,</i>
<i>  how long can the former</i>
<i>  champ last on fire like this?</i>

40:45.777 --> 40:47.844
<i> [kenny] well, remember,</i>
<i>  we just saw minotaur</i>

40:47.846 --> 40:49.879
<i>  make it the full</i>
<i>  three minutes on fire.</i>

40:49.881 --> 40:53.450
<i>  But, chris, no two</i>
<i>  robots are designed the same.</i>

40:53.452 --> 40:56.119
<i>  This is gonna come</i>
<i>  down to the way the</i>
<i>  electronics are laid out</i>

40:56.121 --> 40:57.654
<i>  inside of tombstone,</i>

40:57.656 --> 41:02.392
<i>  but a fire like this could</i>
<i>  kill critical components</i>
<i>  at any moment.</i>

41:04.496 --> 41:05.962
[chris]
<i>  this is unbelievable,</i>

41:05.964 --> 41:09.899
<i>  the complete backside</i>
<i>  of tombstone totally</i>
<i>  engulfed in flames.</i>

41:09.901 --> 41:12.535
<i>  But let's remember,</i>
<i>  captain shrederator</i>
<i>  has had its own</i>

41:12.537 --> 41:14.637
<i>  durability issues</i>
<i>  in the past.</i>

41:14.639 --> 41:18.641
<i>  Its weapon is down</i>
<i>  for the count so this</i>
<i>  thing ain't over yet.</i>

41:19.978 --> 41:22.145
<i>  Can the former</i>
<i>  champ find a way</i>
<i>  to survive?</i>

41:22.147 --> 41:25.381
<i>  Or do we have a</i>
<i>  monumental upset</i>
<i>  in the making</i>

41:25.383 --> 41:28.218
<i>  here on the opening night</i>
<i>  of the season?</i>

41:28.220 --> 41:29.819
Uh-oh.

41:29.821 --> 41:33.890
<i> [chris] just under 90</i>
<i>  seconds to go and tombstone</i>
<i>  is not moving, kenny.</i>

41:33.892 --> 41:36.426
[kenny]
<i>  team shrederator</i>
<i>  thinks they have it.</i>

41:37.329 --> 41:39.162
[chris]
<i>  here comes the countdown.</i>

41:39.164 --> 41:42.966
<i>  The king tombstone</i>
<i>  is gonna fall to a team</i>

41:42.968 --> 41:47.136
<i> - with only three wins</i>
<i>  in its last 13 matches.</i>
<i> -[referee] ...Two, one.</i>

41:47.138 --> 41:48.571
That's a knockout!

41:52.043 --> 41:56.346
<i> [chris] and ray billings'</i>
<i>  season just go up in smoke.</i>

42:01.353 --> 42:05.221
<i>  Wow, kenny, when</i>
<i>  two kinetic weapons,</i>
<i>  collide inside the box,</i>

42:05.223 --> 42:07.824
<i>  anything can happen.</i>

42:07.826 --> 42:10.226
[kenny]
<i>  there's no question. It</i>
<i>  was actually a piece of</i>

42:10.228 --> 42:13.129
<i>  tombstone's blade,</i>
<i>  we felt ricochet</i>

42:13.131 --> 42:14.931
<i>  into the glass early</i>
<i>  in this fight,</i>

42:14.933 --> 42:18.735
<i>  you can really see it</i>
<i>  flying around right there.</i>

42:18.737 --> 42:20.970
<i>  And that shot was really</i>
<i>  the beginning of the end</i>

42:20.972 --> 42:22.872
<i>  for ray billings'</i>
<i>  bot in this one.</i>

42:22.874 --> 42:24.941
[chris]
<i>  that impact eventually led</i>

42:24.943 --> 42:28.111
<i>  to a four-alarm fire</i>
<i>  inside of tombstone.</i>

42:28.113 --> 42:31.147
<i>  Sure, it was able to hang on</i>
<i>  for another minute or so,</i>

42:31.149 --> 42:33.249
<i>  but while we saw</i>
<i>  minotaur surviving</i>

42:33.251 --> 42:35.552
<i>  similar inferno</i>
<i>  earlier tonight,</i>

42:35.554 --> 42:39.022
<i>  this one ended up taking</i>
<i>  down the former champ.</i>

42:39.024 --> 42:43.660
<i>  Captain shrederator</i>
<i>  with a shocking upset,</i>
<i>  here on night one.</i>

42:45.163 --> 42:47.497
[cheers and applause]

42:51.736 --> 42:53.002
<i> [chris] brian nave,</i>

42:53.004 --> 42:55.104
that is a way to kick
off a season,

42:55.106 --> 42:56.806
-look how happy you are.
-Yeah!

42:56.808 --> 42:59.275
Long time coming, baby! Yeah!

42:59.277 --> 43:03.179
When you saw the
flames engulf tombstone,
what were you thinking?

43:03.181 --> 43:05.815
Well, I know he
can drive for a
long time on fire,

43:05.817 --> 43:06.849
so I was just kind of saying,

43:06.851 --> 43:08.952
well, should we keep
hitting him? Should we wait?

43:08.954 --> 43:11.154
You know, but we...
You know, we wanted to try to
get him to the hammers

43:11.156 --> 43:13.056
my team was telling
me, "stop it,

43:13.058 --> 43:15.658
don't push him
to the hammers." but I
wanted to hammer him.

43:17.829 --> 43:20.663
Brian, before this
fight, you broke
it down beautifully.

43:20.665 --> 43:22.999
You pretty much executed
what you wanted to do.

43:23.001 --> 43:24.734
Can you take us through
the fight a little bit?

43:24.736 --> 43:27.737
Well, you know, he hits
so hard, you know,

43:27.739 --> 43:30.239
once he hits you, it's
like all the plans are out
the window and just

43:30.241 --> 43:32.875
try to survive and try
to get in there and,

43:32.877 --> 43:35.278
you know, he's got
a new robot, so he's
gonna have to work out

43:35.280 --> 43:39.082
some bugs, so, you
know, he'll be back
and he'll be fine.

43:39.084 --> 43:41.684
But you know what? We're
gonna take the nut this
year, so look out.

43:41.686 --> 43:43.886
Do you really feel
that way, brian?

43:43.888 --> 43:47.890
Well, I think we got a
better... We got
a better chance.

43:47.892 --> 43:51.227
The crowd thinks so,
that's for sure. Yeah!

43:51.229 --> 43:56.299
[crowd chanting] usa!
Usa! Usa! Usa! Usa!

43:56.301 --> 43:58.501
There you go, see.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.770
Spin to win, baby.
They love it.

44:00.772 --> 44:01.938
Brian nave,

44:01.940 --> 44:04.140
congratulations,
off to a 1-0 start.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.541
Thanks.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.916
<i> [chris] so we have our first</i>
<i>  giant upset of the</i>
<i>  2021 season</i>

44:13.918 --> 44:17.420
<i>  as tombstone falls to</i>
<i>  captain shrederator.</i>

44:17.422 --> 44:19.656
<i>  That was unreal.</i>

44:19.658 --> 44:20.857
<i>  Coming up,</i>

44:20.859 --> 44:23.159
<i>  the firestorm has</i>
<i>  only just begun</i>

44:23.161 --> 44:24.427
<i>  as fan favorites,</i>

44:24.429 --> 44:26.262
<i>  free shipping and blacksmith</i>

44:26.264 --> 44:28.765
<i>  blaze their way</i>
<i>  back into the box.</i>

44:28.767 --> 44:32.035
<i>  That's next on battlebots.</i>

44:39.377 --> 44:41.010
[chris]
<i>  welcome back to battlebots.</i>

44:41.012 --> 44:44.313
<i>  Coming your</i>
<i>  way from our new</i>
<i>  home here in las vegas.</i>

44:44.315 --> 44:46.749
<i>  Tonight, we're kicking</i>
<i>  off the qualifying rounds</i>

44:46.751 --> 44:48.184
<i>  of our 2021 season,</i>

44:48.186 --> 44:53.856
<i>  and the bots</i>
<i>  have already made</i>
<i>  their mark here in sin city.</i>

44:53.858 --> 44:57.326
<i>  Sawblaze got the</i>
<i>  party started by ripping</i>
<i>  through minotaur</i>

44:57.328 --> 45:01.397
<i>  in a three minute</i>
<i>  instant classic matchup.</i>

45:02.200 --> 45:04.634
<i>  And to the victor</i>
<i>  go the spoils.</i>

45:04.636 --> 45:07.136
<i>  There you see sawblaze</i>
<i>  captain jamieson go,</i>

45:07.138 --> 45:10.073
<i>  holding a signed piece</i>
<i>  of minotaur's armor.</i>

45:10.075 --> 45:12.241
<i>  It's a tradition here</i>
<i>  at battlebots</i>

45:12.243 --> 45:15.111
<i>  for teams to exchange</i>
<i>  shrapnel after their fights.</i>

45:15.113 --> 45:19.115
<i>  So let's just hope he has</i>
<i>  a big enough trophy shelf.</i>

45:19.117 --> 45:22.118
[jamison] I'd say we hang this
up, but it'd probably
take the whole shelf down.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.086
[woman] yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:23.088 --> 45:25.121
[man] you're going to
need a better shelf.

45:27.125 --> 45:29.892
[chris]
<i>  all right. Let's keep this</i>
<i>  train rolling along.</i>

45:29.894 --> 45:31.994
<i>  Up next, we're calling</i>
<i>  this matchup</i>

45:31.996 --> 45:34.263
<i>  the highly anticipated</i>
<i>  return of</i>

45:34.265 --> 45:36.999
<i>  two of the most beloved</i>
<i>  teams in the sport,</i>

45:37.001 --> 45:39.435
<i>  and oh, my god, there's</i>
<i>  fire everywhere.</i>

45:39.437 --> 45:41.704
I don't know if it's
gonna fit on a
vegas marquee or not,

45:41.706 --> 45:43.906
but work with me here.

45:43.908 --> 45:47.210
[chris]
<i>  we say hello once again</i>
<i>  to al kindle and blacksmith,</i>

45:47.212 --> 45:50.613
<i>  one of the hardest working</i>
<i>  guys in combat robotics.</i>

45:50.615 --> 45:52.849
<i>  And after sitting</i>
<i>  out last season,</i>

45:52.851 --> 45:56.152
<i>  he admitted it was</i>
<i>  tough watching his fellow</i>
<i>  builders from the couch,</i>

45:56.154 --> 45:58.654
<i>  so he strapped his</i>
<i>  tool belt back on</i>

45:58.656 --> 46:03.159
<i>  and the fans, they couldn't</i>
<i>  be any happier.</i>

46:03.161 --> 46:07.063
And when we asked him,
"hey, are you glad to be
back?" he said, "absolutely."

46:07.065 --> 46:10.733
until I started working
on the bot and realized how
much work this was.

46:10.735 --> 46:12.802
Al, he is always a
breath of fresh air.

46:12.804 --> 46:14.303
It is. I... I mean,
it's so much work,

46:14.305 --> 46:16.272
<i>  and this guy gives</i>
<i>  a 100% in</i>

46:16.274 --> 46:18.040
<i>  everything he does,</i>
<i>  whether he's driving the bot</i>

46:18.042 --> 46:19.408
<i>  or building the bot.</i>

46:19.711 --> 46:22.578
<i>  He is excited</i>
<i>  to be back. Can't wait</i>
<i>  to see him out there.</i>

46:24.649 --> 46:27.016
<i> [chris] and also staging</i>
<i>  his triumphant return</i>

46:27.018 --> 46:28.317
<i>  is the man,</i>

46:28.319 --> 46:29.652
<i>  the myth,</i>

46:29.654 --> 46:31.721
<i>  the legend himself,</i>

46:31.723 --> 46:35.858
<i>  gary gin, the fire starter</i>
<i>  with free shipping.</i>

46:35.860 --> 46:40.096
<i>  We asked gary how</i>
<i>  important is winning to you,</i>
<i>  and he said,</i>

46:40.098 --> 46:43.633
"it's not that important.
I just love putting on a
great show for everybody."

46:43.635 --> 46:45.434
that's what we love to hear.

46:45.770 --> 46:48.037
<i> [kenny] absolutely. Listen,</i>
<i>  both of these guys really</i>
<i>  are cut from the same cloth.</i>

46:48.039 --> 46:51.073
<i>  So I expect a very</i>
<i>  exciting fight.</i>

46:51.075 --> 46:54.277
<i>  He said it's gonna</i>
<i>  be three minutes of</i>
<i>  absolute insanity, so</i>

46:54.279 --> 46:55.278
<i>  let's get to it.</i>

46:55.280 --> 46:57.313
What do you say
to two old guys?

46:57.315 --> 46:59.248
-Ogs, let's call 'em ogs.
-Ogs.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.784
-Yeah.
-Cheers to you.

47:01.786 --> 47:03.419
<i> [chris] faruq, take it away.</i>

47:04.722 --> 47:06.389
[faruq] in the red square,

47:06.391 --> 47:09.392
his special delivery
is always on time,

47:09.394 --> 47:11.427
and it's a big
box of punishment.

47:11.429 --> 47:14.330
Call him slamazon prime.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.032
When he knocks on your door,

47:16.034 --> 47:18.234
you know you don't
stand a chance.

47:18.236 --> 47:23.372
He's the ups of making
you pee your pants.

47:23.374 --> 47:26.909
Here comes free shipping!

47:26.911 --> 47:29.512
[dramatic music playing]

47:29.514 --> 47:31.681
[cheers and applause]

47:31.683 --> 47:36.652
<i> [chris] and there he is,</i>
<i>  the man with his mug</i>
<i>  on our mug. Gary gin,</i>

47:36.654 --> 47:41.657
<i>  a cult hero at battle</i>
<i>  bots, and I'd say it's</i>
<i>  well-deserved, kenny.</i>

47:41.659 --> 47:45.094
<i> [kenny] yeah, I mean, this</i>
<i>  guy isn't just a great</i>
<i>  personality in the sport,</i>

47:45.096 --> 47:49.098
<i>  but he's also</i>
<i>  one of the most respected</i>
<i>  drivers of all time.</i>

47:49.100 --> 47:52.168
<i>  Free shipping is a control</i>
<i>  bot through and through,</i>

47:52.170 --> 47:56.105
<i>  and gary plays</i>
<i>  this thing like a violin.</i>

47:56.107 --> 47:57.840
[faruq] in the blue square,

47:57.842 --> 47:59.375
a bot who's from jersey,

47:59.377 --> 48:01.310
like kevin smith and jay,

48:01.312 --> 48:03.179
who makes him enemies think,

48:03.181 --> 48:06.616
"I'm not even supposed
to be here today."

48:06.618 --> 48:08.451
when his hammer comes down,

48:08.453 --> 48:10.152
the sound is quite violent

48:10.154 --> 48:14.090
and the crowd gets so
pumped, not even
bob can stay silent.

48:14.092 --> 48:16.025
Snooze to the noose,

48:16.027 --> 48:19.028
it's blacksmith.
[cheers and applause]

48:23.067 --> 48:25.268
<i>  [chris]</i>
<i>  kenny, how lucky are we?</i>

48:25.270 --> 48:29.038
<i>  It's the return of one</i>
<i>  of the most entertaining</i>
<i>  bots of all time</i>

48:29.040 --> 48:30.172
<i>  in blacksmith.</i>

48:30.174 --> 48:31.741
<i>  And if you don't believe me,</i>

48:31.743 --> 48:34.176
<i>  just check out</i>
<i>  the 24</i>
<i>  million views</i>

48:34.178 --> 48:37.246
<i>  their 2016</i>
<i>  fight</i>
<i>  against minotaur</i>

48:37.248 --> 48:39.081
<i>  actually has online.</i>

48:39.083 --> 48:42.251
[kenny]
<i>  and how many of those</i>
<i>  views were you, chris?</i>

48:42.253 --> 48:45.988
<i> [chris] I'd say about</i>
<i>  half of them. I really</i>
<i>  missed these guys.</i>

48:48.893 --> 48:51.193
<i>  Yeah, we've gotta</i>
<i>  fight blacksmith tonight.</i>

48:51.195 --> 48:53.462
<i>  He's a little different</i>
<i>  this season.</i>

48:53.464 --> 48:57.300
<i>  Now he has a...</i>
<i>  What do you... I guess he's</i>
<i>  calling a power hammer?</i>

48:57.302 --> 49:00.036
<i>  But it kind</i>
<i>  of looks just like a</i>
<i>  vertical disc to me.</i>

49:00.038 --> 49:01.938
<i>  Hopefully,</i>
<i>  he doesn't cut</i>
<i>  through the top.</i>

49:01.940 --> 49:04.941
<i>  Hopefully, we</i>
<i>  can just push him around,</i>
<i>  slam him around.</i>

49:04.943 --> 49:07.209
<i>  He's probably gonna</i>
<i>  try to come right at us,</i>

49:07.211 --> 49:10.379
<i>  but, uh, we're just gonna</i>
<i>  try to outmaneuver him,</i>

49:10.381 --> 49:13.983
<i>  stay underneath him,</i>
<i>  push him around,</i>

49:13.985 --> 49:16.185
<i>  um, and try to</i>
<i>  stay in control.</i>

49:16.187 --> 49:18.888
<i>  We've made a rather</i>
<i>  radical revision change</i>

49:18.890 --> 49:20.423
<i>  with this, uh,</i>
<i>  version this season.</i>

49:20.425 --> 49:22.425
<i>  We're calling it</i>
<i>  a power hammer.</i>

49:22.427 --> 49:24.026
<i>  It's a spinner type weapon.</i>

49:24.028 --> 49:25.194
<i>  We did retain the fire,</i>

49:25.196 --> 49:27.663
<i>  so it still has the</i>
<i>  fire hammer effect.</i>

49:27.665 --> 49:29.799
<i>  One of the reasons we</i>
<i>  went with this revision</i>

49:29.801 --> 49:31.901
<i>  is 'cause in the past</i>
<i>  it became clear that</i>

49:31.903 --> 49:34.570
<i>  we were having difficulty</i>
<i>  with judges' decisions</i>

49:34.572 --> 49:36.939
<i> because of our inability to do</i>

49:36.941 --> 49:38.307
<i>  visible damage.</i>

49:38.309 --> 49:41.811
<i>  So we felt this change</i>
<i>  was the way we had to go</i>

49:41.813 --> 49:43.479
<i>  to, uh, go to</i>
<i>  the next level.</i>

49:43.481 --> 49:45.481
<i>  We're hoping it</i>
<i>  all comes together.</i>

49:49.620 --> 49:50.953
We're back.

49:50.955 --> 49:52.855
[cheers and applause]

49:52.857 --> 49:54.523
[robotic voice]
<i>  robots activate.</i>

49:55.793 --> 49:59.161
<i> [chris] we are ready</i>
<i>  to fight fire with fire.</i>

49:59.163 --> 50:03.632
<i>  Blacksmith's</i>
<i>  showing off already.</i>
<i>  So too is free shipping.</i>

50:03.634 --> 50:06.235
<i>  Believe it or not,</i>
<i> these two veterans are meeting</i>

50:06.237 --> 50:10.039
<i>  inside the battlebox</i>
<i>  for the very first time.</i>

50:10.041 --> 50:14.076
[cheers and applause]

50:14.078 --> 50:15.878
[robotic voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

50:15.880 --> 50:17.113
Yes.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.350
<i> [chris] yeah,</i>
<i>  gary gin is back.</i>

50:23.321 --> 50:25.421
[robotic voice]
<i>  blue team, ready.</i>

50:26.324 --> 50:28.991
<i> [chris] al kindle,</i>
<i>  pumped up too.</i>

50:28.993 --> 50:31.460
[cheers and applause]

50:41.639 --> 50:45.474
[crowd chanting]
fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

50:56.854 --> 50:59.889
<i> [chris] let</i>
<i>  the bot battle begin.</i>

50:59.891 --> 51:03.292
<i>  Oh, free shipping...</i>
<i>  Oh, yes. We got</i>
<i>  big time flames already.</i>

51:03.294 --> 51:04.927
<i>  I missed you, boys.</i>

51:04.929 --> 51:06.962
<i> [kenny] oh, gary gin.</i>

51:06.964 --> 51:10.232
<i> [chris] oh, yes!</i>
<i>  Into the upper deck.</i>

51:10.234 --> 51:13.169
<i>  Oh, free shipping with some</i>
<i>  evasive maneuvers there</i>

51:13.171 --> 51:15.971
<i>  and right on top</i>
<i>  of blacksmith, kenny.</i>

51:15.973 --> 51:18.140
<i> [kenny] big hit coming</i>
<i>  from al kindle</i>

51:18.142 --> 51:21.077
<i> [chris] he said, "we have</i>
<i>  knockout power now."</i>

51:21.079 --> 51:22.711
<i> [kenny] great control</i>
<i>  by free shipping.</i>

51:22.713 --> 51:26.082
<i>  Hitting blacksmith</i>
<i>  with their pulverizer.</i>

51:26.084 --> 51:29.251
<i> [chris] oh. And then</i>
<i>  a side shot from blacksmith.</i>

51:29.253 --> 51:33.189
<i> [kenny] blacksmith has been</i>
<i>  super aggressive so far.</i>

51:33.191 --> 51:35.691
<i> -[kenny] oh.</i>
<i> -[chris] another swing of</i>
<i>  hammer by blacksmith.</i>

51:35.693 --> 51:37.660
<i>  And look at the flame.</i>

51:37.662 --> 51:41.063
<i> [kenny] oh. A beautiful</i>
<i>  reversal from free shipping,</i>

51:41.065 --> 51:43.766
<i>  followed by some friendly</i>
<i>  fire from the pulverizer.</i>

51:43.768 --> 51:47.136
<i>  Now, gary gin...</i>
<i>  Gary got lifted...</i>

51:47.138 --> 51:51.874
<i> [chris] oh, he does a nice</i>
<i>  job flipping blacksmith over,</i>
<i>  and it rights itself nicely.</i>

51:51.876 --> 51:55.578
<i> [kenny] that was</i>
<i>  a beautiful self-right</i>
<i>  there by team blacksmith.</i>

51:55.580 --> 51:57.980
<i> [chris] a little</i>
<i>  weapon on weapon.</i>

51:57.982 --> 52:01.283
<i> [kenny] now kindle said</i>
<i>  this will be a battle</i>
<i>  for the ground game.</i>

52:01.285 --> 52:04.854
<i>  And so far, it looks like</i>
<i>  free shipping, able to get</i>
<i>  underneath him here.</i>

52:04.856 --> 52:07.256
<i> [chris] free shipping dodges</i>
<i>  another strike there.</i>

52:07.258 --> 52:09.925
<i>  But blacksmith</i>
<i>  back on the attack.</i>

52:09.927 --> 52:12.661
<i>  And here's gary gin flipping</i>
<i>  blacksmith on its backside</i>

52:12.663 --> 52:15.264
<i>  for the second time tonight.</i>

52:15.266 --> 52:18.968
<i> [kenny] this has been a very</i>
<i>  close fight so far, chris.</i>

52:18.970 --> 52:21.070
<i> [chris] yeah, free shipping</i>
<i>  has had the control.</i>

52:21.072 --> 52:23.272
<i>  Blacksmith with</i>
<i>  the aggression.</i>

52:23.274 --> 52:26.775
<i>  So who's gonna score those</i>
<i>  all-important damage points?</i>

52:26.777 --> 52:28.310
<i> [kenny] oh.</i>

52:28.312 --> 52:31.113
<i> [chris] and gary gin</i>
<i>  taking blacksmith into</i>
<i>  the ram.</i>

52:31.115 --> 52:32.915
[al] yeah, we're there.

52:32.917 --> 52:36.886
<i> [kenny] blacksmith landing</i>
<i>  shots at a very high rate in</i>
<i>  this fight, though, chris.</i>

52:36.888 --> 52:39.655
<i>  That is going to play well</i>
<i>  with the judges.</i>

52:39.657 --> 52:41.991
<i> [chris] yeah, that new</i>
<i>  power hammer has been doing</i>

52:41.993 --> 52:43.292
<i>  work here in this fight.</i>

52:43.294 --> 52:47.096
<i>  But free shipping continuing</i>
<i>  to take it on the chin.</i>

52:47.098 --> 52:50.900
<i>  That big ar 500 wedge</i>
<i>  out front.</i>

52:50.902 --> 52:53.235
<i> -[kenny] uh-oh.</i>
<i> -[chris] another big shot.</i>

52:53.237 --> 52:55.271
<i> [kenny] and you see the back</i>
<i>  of free shipping,</i>

52:55.273 --> 52:58.040
<i>  a chain is broken</i>
<i>  on the back side there.</i>

52:58.042 --> 53:00.342
<i> [chris] could that be</i>
<i>  the first big damage points</i>

53:00.344 --> 53:02.545
<i>  scored by either team</i>
<i>  in this one?</i>

53:03.481 --> 53:05.648
<i>  Oh, man, free shipping</i>
<i>  trying to get</i>

53:05.650 --> 53:07.550
<i>  blacksmith up</i>
<i>  on the upper deck.</i>

53:07.552 --> 53:08.884
<i>  Can it happen?</i>

53:08.886 --> 53:10.819
<i> [kenny] looks like</i>
<i>  free shipping may have lost</i>

53:10.821 --> 53:12.321
<i>  function in their lifter.</i>

53:12.323 --> 53:14.757
[gary]
our front chains are broken.

53:14.759 --> 53:16.825
<i> [chris] you hear gary gin</i>
<i>  confirming it there.</i>

53:16.827 --> 53:19.328
<i>  His weapon chains are toast.</i>

53:19.330 --> 53:22.898
<i>  But free shipping's</i>
<i>  front wedge still</i>
<i>  very much intact</i>

53:22.900 --> 53:26.335
<i>  and continuing to push</i>
<i>  blacksmith around the box.</i>

53:26.337 --> 53:28.304
<i>  30 seconds to go.</i>

53:29.607 --> 53:31.607
<i> [kenny] looks like blacksmith</i>
<i>  may be dealing</i>

53:31.609 --> 53:34.009
<i>  with some fire in their</i>
<i>  internals now, chris.</i>

53:34.011 --> 53:36.979
<i>  Free shipping needs</i>
<i>  to make a push here.</i>

53:36.981 --> 53:40.082
<i>  Al kindle continuing</i>
<i>  to engage them.</i>

53:41.052 --> 53:43.219
<i> [chris] 15 seconds to go.</i>

53:43.221 --> 53:45.721
<i>  Blacksmith trying to</i>
<i>  throw that hammer</i>

53:45.723 --> 53:48.958
<i>  even without the weapon</i>
<i>  spinning at full strength.</i>

53:48.960 --> 53:52.394
<i>  And al kindle lands another</i>
<i>  shot with the pulverizer,</i>

53:52.396 --> 53:55.164
<i>  a nice final impression</i>
<i>  for the judges there.</i>

53:55.166 --> 53:57.533
<i>  What a show these two</i>
<i>  veterans have put on</i>

53:57.535 --> 54:00.302
<i>  for the fans here</i>
<i>  on opening night.</i>

54:00.304 --> 54:01.837
Oh!

54:01.839 --> 54:03.939
<i> [chris] this one is going to</i>
<i>  the scorecards,</i>

54:03.941 --> 54:06.609
<i>  and it is going to be close.</i>

54:10.314 --> 54:14.283
<i>  Okay, kenny, three minutes of</i>
<i>  madness to sort through here.</i>

54:14.285 --> 54:17.186
<i>  How are the judges gonna</i>
<i>  break this one down?</i>

54:17.188 --> 54:18.287
<i> [kenny] these two</i>
<i>  teams definitely</i>

54:18.289 --> 54:20.289
<i>  played the hits for the fans</i>
<i>  with free shipping</i>

54:20.291 --> 54:23.158
<i>  putting on a control clinic</i>
<i>  with that big front wedge</i>

54:23.160 --> 54:27.196
<i>  and blacksmith bringing its</i>
<i>  signature aggression</i>
<i>  and intensity.</i>

54:27.198 --> 54:30.132
<i> [chris] and we got to see</i>
<i>  that new power hammer</i>
<i>  of blacksmith</i>

54:30.134 --> 54:33.969
<i>  get in on the action</i>
<i>  and dole out some</i>
<i>  serious damage.</i>

54:33.971 --> 54:35.871
<i> [kenny] no doubt. But while</i>
<i>  most of the strikes</i>

54:35.873 --> 54:38.974
<i>  found the top of</i>
<i>  free shipping's</i>
<i>  ar 500 armor,</i>

54:38.976 --> 54:41.543
<i>  blacksmith landed</i>
<i>  them in bunches.</i>

54:41.545 --> 54:44.079
<i>  And that's gonna play</i>
<i>  very well with the judges.</i>

54:44.081 --> 54:47.082
<i> [chris] gary gin showing</i>
<i>  his skill by continuing</i>

54:47.084 --> 54:50.953
<i>  to push blacksmith around</i>
<i>  the box and into the hazards.</i>

54:50.955 --> 54:53.289
<i>  But free shipping popped</i>
<i>  its weapon chain</i>

54:53.291 --> 54:56.158
<i>  and couldn't use the lifter</i>
<i>  down the stretch,</i>

54:56.160 --> 54:58.327
<i> [kenny] and that's where</i>
<i>  things get interesting.</i>

54:58.329 --> 55:01.964
<i>  Blacksmith eventually</i>
<i>  lost the ability to</i>
<i>  spin its weapon,</i>

55:01.966 --> 55:04.166
<i>  but it did keep swinging</i>
<i>  that hammer arm</i>

55:04.168 --> 55:05.968
<i>  and it was dealing</i>
<i>  with a fire.</i>

55:05.970 --> 55:08.804
<i>  So, this may just</i>
<i>  come down to which bot</i>

55:08.806 --> 55:11.273
<i>  made it to the closing bell</i>
<i>  in better shape</i>

55:11.275 --> 55:14.643
<i>  and who the judges feel was</i>
<i>  the more aggressive team.</i>

55:14.645 --> 55:15.778
<i>  Tough call.</i>

55:15.780 --> 55:18.080
<i> [chris] let's go to</i>
<i>  faruq, with the decision.</i>

55:19.617 --> 55:22.518
The results from the judges
are in.

55:26.924 --> 55:31.327
[faruq] and the winner by
unanimous decision is...

55:35.833 --> 55:37.366
...Blacksmith.

55:43.207 --> 55:44.606
[man] smash and burn.

55:51.215 --> 55:53.415
<i> [chris] al kindle,</i>
<i>  welcome back.</i>

55:53.417 --> 55:55.184
Thanks, it's great
to be back.

55:55.186 --> 55:58.187
-Yeah, how nice is a w?
-Awesome.

55:58.189 --> 55:59.521
Just a one-word answer.

55:59.523 --> 56:01.790
Al, how about,
"I'm so excited to be back.

56:01.792 --> 56:03.992
I can't believe it! I'm gonna
go win the giant nut!"?

56:03.994 --> 56:06.762
You want me to do
the interview with
myself here, al.

56:06.764 --> 56:08.997
Hey, man, you can come
down and be the captain.
You did a good job.

56:08.999 --> 56:11.900
No, no, no.
Were you a little surprised

56:11.902 --> 56:14.103
by the decision
because you were on fire

56:14.105 --> 56:15.971
for the last 45 seconds or so?

56:15.973 --> 56:17.406
Um, honestly, not really.

56:17.408 --> 56:20.342
We did... I think we lost
the weapon, uh, the spinner's
speed controller.

56:20.344 --> 56:22.244
This is an entirely new
weapon system.

56:22.246 --> 56:24.179
We had a lot of concerns
about it.

56:24.181 --> 56:26.281
But other than that little bit
of fire at the end,

56:26.283 --> 56:28.283
it worked awesomely,
we did a lot of damage

56:28.285 --> 56:30.319
and that was our goal
this season

56:30.321 --> 56:33.922
to actually do some visible
damage and be able to
win decisions.

56:33.924 --> 56:36.125
<i> [kenny] it seems like</i>
<i>  the difference was</i>

56:36.127 --> 56:38.026
you getting those hits in
with your primary weapon.

56:38.028 --> 56:41.296
Do you think that's why
the judges, uh, went with
team blacksmith?

56:41.298 --> 56:42.931
Absolutely. I think
that's... Again,

56:42.933 --> 56:44.233
that's why we made
these changes.

56:44.235 --> 56:45.868
We had to be able
to do some damage.

56:45.870 --> 56:47.970
We have the durability,
we have the drive train,

56:47.972 --> 56:49.204
and now we have damage.

56:49.206 --> 56:51.940
Al kindle, was this fun?

56:51.942 --> 56:53.175
This was great.
Gary's awesome.

56:53.177 --> 56:54.276
That bot is a lot of fun.

56:54.278 --> 56:56.945
He's a great driver.
I knew this was gonna be

56:56.947 --> 56:59.815
three minutes of madness,
and that's what it was.

56:59.817 --> 57:02.017
Al, smile for
everybody around the...

57:02.019 --> 57:05.120
There you go, al kindle
and blacksmith with a win.

57:05.122 --> 57:06.855
I knew it could happen.

57:06.857 --> 57:08.123
Congratulations.

57:08.125 --> 57:10.959
[cheers and applause]

57:13.664 --> 57:15.197
<i> [chris] so, kenny, you heard</i>
<i>  al kindle.</i>

57:15.199 --> 57:18.066
<i>  He said he wasn't surprised</i>
<i>  by the decision. Were you?</i>

57:18.068 --> 57:20.402
You know, it seems like
it was the control aspect

57:20.404 --> 57:22.871
of free shipping
versus those hits

57:22.873 --> 57:24.940
from al kindle
and team blacksmith.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.209
<i>  The judges are gonna</i>
<i>  weigh those strikes</i>

57:27.211 --> 57:29.044
<i>  more heavily than,</i>
<i>  say, the control.</i>

57:29.046 --> 57:30.145
<i>  I think that</i>
<i>  was the difference.</i>

57:30.147 --> 57:32.281
<i>  It was an awesome fight</i>
<i>  between two ogs,</i>

57:32.283 --> 57:33.816
<i>  east coast versus west coast.</i>

57:33.818 --> 57:34.917
East coast got it done.

57:34.952 --> 57:38.053
-It's like
biggie and tupac, right?
-Exactly, exactly.

57:38.055 --> 57:41.089
Uh, cheers once again to
gary gin. I... I just
love these things.

57:41.091 --> 57:43.158
I'm gonna use this
the rest of my life.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.927
All right. Coming up...

57:44.929 --> 57:47.896
After dropping 20 lbs
off its blade,

57:47.898 --> 57:51.133
will deep six still feel like
777s here in vegas?

57:51.135 --> 57:54.336
Or will pain train and
its new ar 500 firewall

57:54.338 --> 57:57.272
be enough to run 'em
out of town on a rail?

57:57.274 --> 58:00.476
Find out when we
continue on battlebots.

58:09.954 --> 58:11.253
<i> [chris] welcome back</i>
<i>  to battlebots,</i>

58:11.255 --> 58:15.224
<i>  where the fans are ready for</i>
<i>  more robot on robot crime.</i>

58:15.226 --> 58:17.860
<i>  And what a ride</i>
<i>  it's been so far.</i>

58:17.862 --> 58:20.028
<i>  2021's opening night</i>
<i>  fight card</i>

58:20.030 --> 58:23.098
<i>  has been a smorgasbord</i>
<i>  of destruction,</i>

58:23.100 --> 58:26.268
<i>  and we've yet to serve up</i>
<i>  the evening's main course.</i>

58:26.270 --> 58:31.139
<i>  That's gonna be an</i>
<i>  epic matchup between</i>
<i>  hydra and end game.</i>

58:31.141 --> 58:33.275
[cheer and applause]

58:33.277 --> 58:36.912
<i>  and there is a live look at</i>
<i>  the defending champions,</i>
<i>  end game,</i>

58:36.914 --> 58:38.981
<i>  making some last minute</i>
<i>  adjustments</i>

58:38.983 --> 58:41.450
<i>  to their vertical spinner</i>
<i>  back in the pits.</i>

58:43.721 --> 58:46.054
<i>  And there you see</i>
<i>  the man who says his goal</i>

58:46.056 --> 58:48.991
<i>  is to flip a bot into</i>
<i>  the ceiling lights this year,</i>

58:48.993 --> 58:51.126
<i>  jake ewert and hydra.</i>

58:51.128 --> 58:53.962
<i>  What a showdown</i>
<i>  this is gonna be.</i>

58:55.866 --> 58:57.833
<i>  The main event is</i>
<i>  just around the corner,</i>

58:57.835 --> 59:01.303
<i>  but first, we have</i>
<i>  a fascinating clash</i>
<i>  of designs for you</i>

59:01.305 --> 59:04.706
<i>  as pain train takes</i>
<i>  on deep six.</i>

59:04.708 --> 59:06.775
<i>  And let's start</i>
<i>  with pain train,</i>

59:06.777 --> 59:11.947
<i>  captained by new york city's</i>
<i>  very own evan arias.</i>

59:11.949 --> 59:16.118
<i>  His debut 2020 season</i>
<i>  didn't go exactly as planned.</i>

59:16.120 --> 59:17.085
<i>  But you know what?</i>

59:17.087 --> 59:19.888
<i>  Evan is still as</i>
<i>  enthusiastic as ever.</i>

59:19.890 --> 59:23.191
He's like, "dude, I cannot
wait to get back.
I learned so much."

59:23.193 --> 59:25.360
hopefully, one thing he
learned is not to have

59:25.362 --> 59:28.430
his robot fall apart
inside the battlebox

59:28.432 --> 59:30.032
'cause it happened a few times
a season ago.

59:30.034 --> 59:32.167
That's right. He did say
he learned a lot.

59:32.169 --> 59:34.770
<i>  He believes that he's</i>
<i>  still the king of new york,</i>

59:34.772 --> 59:36.905
<i>  so he's coming in</i>
<i>  very confident.</i>

59:36.907 --> 59:38.974
<i>  You know, some guys</i>
<i>  coming in their second year,</i>

59:38.976 --> 59:40.909
<i>  they say, "you know, I</i>
<i>  just wanna win</i>
<i>  a couple fights.</i>

59:40.911 --> 59:42.044
<i>  I want to be exciting."</i>

59:42.146 --> 59:45.047
<i>  not evan. He says, "I want</i>
<i>  to win the giant nut."</i>

59:45.049 --> 59:46.848
so, he's got
lofty goals there.

59:46.850 --> 59:49.117
Tonight, he is
taking on deep six,

59:49.119 --> 59:51.253
<i>  which certainly left an</i>
<i>  indelible mark, uh,</i>

59:51.255 --> 59:53.722
<i>  two seasons ago,</i>
<i>  when we last saw them.</i>

59:53.724 --> 59:56.024
<i>  Indelible as in they</i>
<i>  shattered a light</i>

59:56.026 --> 59:58.260
<i>  and took a huge chunk</i>
<i>  out of our floor with that</i>

59:58.262 --> 1:00:00.228
<i>  one hundred pound weapon.</i>

1:00:00.230 --> 1:00:02.631
<i>  By the way, dustin esswein,</i>
<i>  the team captain,</i>

1:00:02.633 --> 1:00:03.932
you have yet to pay for that.

1:00:03.934 --> 1:00:05.901
So, you know, the interest
on that thing

1:00:05.903 --> 1:00:08.770
is just growing and
growing by the day.

1:00:08.772 --> 1:00:11.974
<i>  As far as the weapon,</i>
<i>  a little less weight on it.</i>

1:00:11.976 --> 1:00:13.742
<i>  I can't wait to see</i>
<i>  what that means.</i>

1:00:13.744 --> 1:00:14.776
That's right. And that
should help them

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:16.044
fight physics
a little bit more.

1:00:16.046 --> 1:00:18.714
They were off balance.
They were completely
out of control.

1:00:18.716 --> 1:00:20.949
<i>  And of course, that's why</i>
<i>  they took a chunk</i>
<i>  out of the floor.</i>

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:23.118
<i>  Hopefully, they don't</i>
<i>  do that this season.</i>

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:25.120
<i> [chris] all right. It should</i>
<i>  be very interesting.</i>

1:00:25.122 --> 1:00:28.690
Let's see if either of these
bots improved. Faruq.

1:00:28.692 --> 1:00:31.026
[cheers and applause]

1:00:32.029 --> 1:00:36.198
in the red square from
new york city, new york.

1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:40.235
All aboard,
next stop, montauk!

1:00:40.237 --> 1:00:43.605
But the stop after that...
Pure agony.

1:00:43.607 --> 1:00:46.341
It's pain train.

1:00:46.343 --> 1:00:48.210
[cheers and applause]

1:00:48.212 --> 1:00:51.246
[dramatic music playing]

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:54.216
<i> [chris] and</i>
<i>  check out this crew,</i>

1:00:54.218 --> 1:00:56.885
<i>  captained by evan arias,</i>
<i>  there on the right</i>

1:00:56.887 --> 1:00:59.921
<i>  kenny, pain train has a whole</i>
<i>  lot to prove this season,</i>

1:00:59.923 --> 1:01:01.523
<i>  don't you think?</i>

1:01:01.825 --> 1:01:04.793
<i> [kenny] no doubt about it.</i>
<i>  Raised in the mean streets</i>
<i>  of new york city,</i>

1:01:04.795 --> 1:01:07.295
<i>  evan had to kick and</i>
<i>  scrap to make his way</i>

1:01:07.297 --> 1:01:08.997
<i>  into the robotics community.</i>

1:01:08.999 --> 1:01:11.633
<i>  His three-pound bot</i>
<i>  shreddit bro</i>

1:01:11.635 --> 1:01:15.103
<i>  is a hall of fame machine</i>
<i>  on the beetle weight circuit,</i>

1:01:15.105 --> 1:01:18.240
<i>  but he struggled badly</i>
<i>  here at battlebots</i>
<i>  in his rookie season.</i>

1:01:18.242 --> 1:01:21.643
<i>  Evan is determined to right</i>
<i>  the ship this time around.</i>

1:01:24.281 --> 1:01:27.783
In the blue square
from norfolk, virginia,

1:01:27.785 --> 1:01:31.386
the six in its name
stands for six feet under.

1:01:31.388 --> 1:01:34.656
Watch out for its spinner.
It will tear you asunder.

1:01:34.658 --> 1:01:37.959
It's deep six!

1:01:41.265 --> 1:01:43.331
<i> [chris] welcome back</i>
<i>  deep six.</i>

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:47.202
<i>  Captained by</i>
<i>  the us navy diver</i>
<i>  dustin esswein</i>

1:01:47.204 --> 1:01:52.240
<i>  pushing deep six in,</i>
<i>  this is a totally</i>
<i>  new look team, kenny.</i>

1:01:52.242 --> 1:01:54.342
<i> [kenny] that's right.</i>
<i> After seeing the uphill battle</i>

1:01:54.344 --> 1:01:56.611
<i>  he faced with deep six,</i>
<i>  dustin decided</i>

1:01:56.613 --> 1:01:58.714
<i>  to swap out his old navy pals</i>

1:01:58.716 --> 1:02:01.950
<i>  for some more</i>
<i>  robotics familiar engineers</i>
<i>  this season.</i>

1:02:01.952 --> 1:02:04.319
<i>  And he says, "you'll</i>
<i>  be able to see the results</i>

1:02:04.321 --> 1:02:07.823
<i>  once this oversized</i>
<i>  vertical spinner fires up."</i>

1:02:07.825 --> 1:02:10.125
<i> [chris] swapping out brawns</i>
<i>  for brains.</i>

1:02:10.127 --> 1:02:14.629
<i>  We'll see if it pays off</i>
<i>  for dustin and this</i>
<i>  unpredictable robot.</i>

1:02:16.734 --> 1:02:18.066
<i>  So this year, I have</i>
<i>  a point to prove.</i>

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:20.469
<i>  We're back. We're better.</i>
<i>  More pain, more train.</i>

1:02:20.471 --> 1:02:22.938
<i>  I'm looking to claim</i>
<i>  the most aggressive title</i>
<i>  in combat robotics,</i>

1:02:22.940 --> 1:02:24.740
<i>  and I'm gonna take</i>
<i>  everyone face to face.</i>

1:02:24.742 --> 1:02:26.274
<i>  Everything's at stake</i>
<i>  going into this first fight.</i>

1:02:26.276 --> 1:02:27.976
<i>  It's really gonna set</i>
<i>  the tone for this season,</i>

1:02:27.978 --> 1:02:29.644
<i>  for the team</i>
<i>  and for the robot.</i>

1:02:29.646 --> 1:02:32.948
<i>  And I can't wait to put</i>
<i>  deep six six feet deep.</i>

1:02:32.950 --> 1:02:35.851
<i>  The last time we were here,</i>
<i>  we had a lot of</i>
<i>  reliability issues.</i>

1:02:35.853 --> 1:02:38.053
<i>  Uh, and basically the main</i>
<i>  focus of this build was</i>

1:02:38.055 --> 1:02:40.122
<i>  to solve all those.</i>
<i>  So I mean, it's designed</i>

1:02:40.124 --> 1:02:43.759
<i>  to hit as hard as possible,</i>
<i>  and it'll do that.</i>

1:02:43.761 --> 1:02:45.794
<i>  The challenge is</i>
<i>  surviving our own hits.</i>

1:02:45.796 --> 1:02:47.829
<i>  Pain train's strategy</i>
<i>  is definitely gonna be</i>

1:02:47.831 --> 1:02:49.331
<i>  to try to get</i>
<i>  around the sides,</i>

1:02:49.333 --> 1:02:50.799
<i>  uh, get to the front.</i>

1:02:50.801 --> 1:02:53.769
<i>  He's a great driver and</i>
<i>  he knows what he's doing,</i>

1:02:53.771 --> 1:02:56.438
<i>  so we're just gonna have to</i>
<i>  keep up with all that.</i>

1:03:00.010 --> 1:03:01.810
[robotic voice]
<i>  robots activate.</i>

1:03:01.812 --> 1:03:04.446
[cheers and applause]

1:03:08.285 --> 1:03:11.186
<i> [chris] it's</i>
<i>  the tower of power</i>

1:03:11.188 --> 1:03:15.323
<i>  versus the little engine</i>
<i>  that should. Deep six.</i>

1:03:15.325 --> 1:03:17.259
<i>  Pain train.</i>

1:03:17.261 --> 1:03:20.228
<i>  When battlebox continues.</i>

1:03:25.969 --> 1:03:27.736
<i> [chris] welcome back</i>
<i>  to battlebots.</i>

1:03:27.738 --> 1:03:29.805
<i>  We are right back</i>
<i>  into the action.</i>

1:03:29.807 --> 1:03:33.441
<i>  Here's a clash of designs,</i>
<i>  comes to a crescendo.</i>

1:03:33.443 --> 1:03:37.112
<i>  It's deep six</i>
<i>  versus pain train.</i>

1:03:37.114 --> 1:03:39.347
<i>  And it's right now.</i>

1:03:39.349 --> 1:03:41.983
[robotic voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

1:03:41.985 --> 1:03:43.418
Go.

1:03:48.959 --> 1:03:50.959
[robotic voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

1:03:50.961 --> 1:03:52.327
[man] yeah.

1:04:13.116 --> 1:04:16.117
Deep six is going six deep.

1:04:16.119 --> 1:04:17.919
<i> [chris] look at that thing,</i>
<i>  kenny.</i>

1:04:17.921 --> 1:04:20.422
<i>  Certainly hope you got</i>
<i>  your will notarized.</i>

1:04:24.194 --> 1:04:26.127
<i> [chris] let the bot battle</i>
<i>  begin.</i>

1:04:26.129 --> 1:04:28.797
<i>  Pain train with a box rush</i>
<i>  but a bit out of control</i>

1:04:28.799 --> 1:04:30.699
<i>  as it ends up in the corner.</i>

1:04:30.701 --> 1:04:34.302
<i>  In the meantime, deep six</i>
<i>  trying to get out of</i>
<i>  its own square.</i>

1:04:35.939 --> 1:04:39.107
<i>  Oh, boy. Can't wait</i>
<i>  for the first shot.</i>

1:04:39.109 --> 1:04:40.876
<i>  Will it be weapon on weapon?</i>

1:04:40.878 --> 1:04:44.312
<i> [kenny] oh, deep six just</i>
<i>  made itself vulnerable</i>
<i>  there on the flank.</i>

1:04:44.314 --> 1:04:48.149
<i>  Let's see if pain train</i>
<i>  able to take advantage of it.</i>

1:04:48.151 --> 1:04:51.219
<i>  [chris] both teams having</i>
<i>  an issue trying to</i>
<i>  get in the right position.</i>

1:04:51.221 --> 1:04:52.387
<i>  Oh, look at that.</i>

1:04:52.389 --> 1:04:54.289
-[chris]
<i>  that 80-pound weapon...</i>
<i> -[kenny] oh.</i>

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:57.792
<i> [chris] ...Of deep six ends</i>
<i>  up taking a chunk out</i>
<i>  of the floor again.</i>

1:04:57.794 --> 1:05:00.095
<i> [kenny] big impact there,</i>
<i>  but pain train</i>

1:05:00.097 --> 1:05:02.631
<i>  took some damage</i>
<i>  to that right wheel, chris,</i>

1:05:02.633 --> 1:05:04.933
<i>  and with their</i>
<i>  two-wheel configuration,</i>

1:05:04.935 --> 1:05:06.268
<i>  that's gonna be a problem.</i>

1:05:06.270 --> 1:05:08.837
<i> [chris] well, it can</i>
<i>  get around still.</i>

1:05:08.839 --> 1:05:11.206
<i> The question is, can it figure</i>
<i>  out which direction to go?</i>

1:05:11.208 --> 1:05:14.609
<i>  Uh-oh, we got some more</i>
<i>  rubber on the floor.</i>

1:05:14.611 --> 1:05:16.878
<i>  Oh, this is a real problem</i>
<i>  now, kenny.</i>

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:19.381
<i> [kenny] yeah, and it's lost</i>
<i>  contact with the floor</i>
<i>  on that right side.</i>

1:05:19.383 --> 1:05:21.049
<i> -[kenny] that's not good.</i>
<i> -[chris] oh, no.</i>

1:05:21.051 --> 1:05:24.085
<i> -[kenny] oh!</i>
<i> -[chris] oh!</i>

1:05:24.087 --> 1:05:26.621
<i> [chris] wow! Oh, my god.</i>

1:05:26.623 --> 1:05:31.459
[dustin] yeah!
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

1:05:31.461 --> 1:05:33.361
<i> [kenny] pain train in</i>
<i>  some serious pain.</i>

1:05:33.363 --> 1:05:35.730
<i>  Look at that fire.</i>

1:05:35.732 --> 1:05:38.867
<i> [chris] they say there's</i>
<i>  nothing like an open flame,</i>
<i>  kenny.</i>

1:05:38.869 --> 1:05:42.871
<i>  Just makes the bot taste</i>
<i>  so crispy and delicious.</i>

1:05:42.873 --> 1:05:46.207
[referee] three, two, one.
That's a knockout.

1:05:46.209 --> 1:05:49.444
[cheers and applause]

1:05:54.418 --> 1:05:57.052
deep six! Deep six! Deep six!

1:05:59.923 --> 1:06:02.390
<i> [chris] kenny, we wondered</i>
<i>  which bot was gonna land</i>

1:06:02.392 --> 1:06:05.961
<i>  the first big time blow,</i>
<i>  and it was indeed deep six.</i>

1:06:05.963 --> 1:06:08.096
<i> [kenny] yeah, absolutely.</i>
<i>  It looked like they were</i>

1:06:08.098 --> 1:06:10.832
<i>  gonna be in trouble there,</i>
<i>  when their own weapon</i>

1:06:10.834 --> 1:06:12.367
<i>  rammed into the floor again,</i>

1:06:12.369 --> 1:06:14.135
<i>  but they were</i>
<i>  able to recover</i>

1:06:14.137 --> 1:06:16.338
<i>  and they showed</i>
<i>  their reliability,</i>

1:06:16.340 --> 1:06:17.772
<i>  and they also</i>
<i>  showed their power.</i>

1:06:17.774 --> 1:06:19.941
<i>  My goodness, that thing</i>
<i>  packs a wallop.</i>

1:06:19.943 --> 1:06:23.078
<i> [chris] and it also shows you</i>
<i>  what having tires exposed</i>

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:24.946
<i>  can do to you</i>
<i>  in the case of pain train.</i>

1:06:24.948 --> 1:06:26.614
<i> [kenny] yeah, that's right.</i>
<i>  They took away</i>

1:06:26.616 --> 1:06:28.049
<i>  one of those wheels.</i>
<i>  It was no longer</i>

1:06:28.051 --> 1:06:29.751
<i>  making contact</i>
<i>  with the floor.</i>

1:06:29.753 --> 1:06:32.020
<i>  It could not move, it was</i>
<i>  a sitting duck right there.</i>

1:06:32.022 --> 1:06:34.222
<i>  Deep six took</i>
<i>  full advantage of it,</i>

1:06:34.224 --> 1:06:37.325
and then the batteries
went on fire.
That was amazing.

1:06:37.327 --> 1:06:39.194
<i> [chris] yeah, and we might</i>
<i>  have to recharge</i>

1:06:39.196 --> 1:06:41.162
<i>  those things in time</i>
<i>  for the next fight,</i>

1:06:41.164 --> 1:06:43.331
<i>  or just buy some new ones.</i>

1:06:43.333 --> 1:06:45.166
[cheers and applause]

1:06:46.003 --> 1:06:47.902
hey, dustin,
it... It only took

1:06:47.904 --> 1:06:49.971
two years, but that's the way

1:06:49.973 --> 1:06:51.840
deep six was supposed
to work, right?

1:06:51.842 --> 1:06:53.875
Man, that was wild, huh?

1:06:53.877 --> 1:06:56.277
Yeah, this was the idea
from the get-go.

1:06:56.279 --> 1:06:59.014
You know what? We're somewhat
reliable now.

1:06:59.016 --> 1:07:00.382
We can take big hits

1:07:00.384 --> 1:07:02.250
and we can give
big hits, you know?

1:07:02.252 --> 1:07:04.052
This is everything
we've always wanted.

1:07:04.054 --> 1:07:05.720
Take us through the fight.

1:07:05.722 --> 1:07:08.156
Yeah, I mean so,
our plan is simple,

1:07:08.158 --> 1:07:10.859
we just have to stay spun-up
and stay facing them.

1:07:10.861 --> 1:07:13.862
If they run into
our weapon, that's great.

1:07:13.864 --> 1:07:15.063
Yeah, it seemed like
you were kinda

1:07:15.065 --> 1:07:16.331
waiting for them
a little bit.

1:07:16.333 --> 1:07:18.033
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean,

1:07:18.035 --> 1:07:21.970
we have no armor at all,
it's just the bar.

1:07:21.972 --> 1:07:25.607
So, well,
we're not gonna come to you.

1:07:25.609 --> 1:07:27.208
You're gonna come to us.

1:07:27.210 --> 1:07:28.843
Hey, dustin,
a couple of years ago,

1:07:28.845 --> 1:07:31.079
you took a big old chunk
out of the floor

1:07:31.081 --> 1:07:32.947
and you still haven't
repaid us for it.

1:07:32.949 --> 1:07:34.315
Do we have to have
kenny over there

1:07:34.317 --> 1:07:36.084
and help you
find your wallet?

1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:38.787
Yeah, I'll... I'll
get you next time around.

1:07:38.789 --> 1:07:40.922
All right, sounds good. We'll
see you in your next fight.

1:07:40.924 --> 1:07:42.290
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1:07:42.292 --> 1:07:45.060
[cheers and applause]

1:07:49.833 --> 1:07:52.300
<i> [chris] so it's</i>
<i>  all pain, no gain,</i>

1:07:52.302 --> 1:07:54.269
<i>  for the team from the nyc,</i>

1:07:54.271 --> 1:07:56.171
<i>  as deep six impresses</i>

1:07:56.173 --> 1:07:59.207
<i>  with that incredibly</i>
<i>  powerful weapon.</i>

1:08:00.077 --> 1:08:01.910
You gonna help 'em
find their wallet or not?

1:08:01.912 --> 1:08:03.678
Because I'm telling you
that bill

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:05.647
is due for that floor
from 2019.

1:08:05.649 --> 1:08:07.615
You know, I got some
down trees in my backyard,

1:08:07.617 --> 1:08:09.751
so I think they may
chop some firewood for me,

1:08:09.753 --> 1:08:10.985
we'll call it even.

1:08:10.987 --> 1:08:14.155
All right, up next, the moment
we've all been waiting for,

1:08:14.157 --> 1:08:16.257
<i>  the defending champs</i>
<i>  are ready to face</i>

1:08:16.259 --> 1:08:20.161
<i>  the most fearsome flipper</i>
<i>  ever to hit the box.</i>

1:08:20.163 --> 1:08:23.465
<i>  Let's take a closer look</i>
<i>  at tonight's main event.</i>

1:08:26.069 --> 1:08:29.337
<i> [chris] oh! Oh, my god!</i>
<i>  That is it.</i>

1:08:29.339 --> 1:08:34.642
<i>  End game is taking</i>
<i>  the giant nut back overseas.</i>

1:08:36.179 --> 1:08:38.947
<i> [nick] last year was</i>
<i>  only our third year,</i>

1:08:38.949 --> 1:08:40.648
<i>  and we won the whole thing.</i>

1:08:40.650 --> 1:08:42.484
We won the giant nut.

1:08:44.187 --> 1:08:46.654
People definitely pay a lot
more attention to us now.

1:08:48.825 --> 1:08:52.127
<i> [faruq] end game!</i>

1:08:52.129 --> 1:08:54.295
<i> [chris] that's gotta be</i>
<i>  the most brutal,</i>

1:08:54.297 --> 1:08:56.264
<i> vertical spinner in the sport.</i>

1:08:56.266 --> 1:08:58.233
That's a knockout.

1:08:59.102 --> 1:09:00.869
<i> [jack] more confident</i>
<i>  than last year,</i>

1:09:00.871 --> 1:09:03.104
<i>  but there is definitely</i>
<i>  a little bit of pressure.</i>

1:09:03.106 --> 1:09:04.939
People are expecting
us to do well,

1:09:04.941 --> 1:09:06.474
and there's a target
on our back.

1:09:07.644 --> 1:09:09.310
<i> We gotta be prepared for that.</i>

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:11.079
<i>  And we've come</i>
<i>  prepared for that.</i>

1:09:12.816 --> 1:09:15.116
<i> -[chris] whoa!</i>
<i> -[kenny] what a flip</i>
<i>  by hydra.</i>

1:09:15.986 --> 1:09:17.218
If you weren't
scared last year,

1:09:17.220 --> 1:09:18.353
you better be this year

1:09:18.355 --> 1:09:21.856
<i>  because it's gonna be</i>
<i>  better than ever.</i>

1:09:21.858 --> 1:09:24.225
<i> [chris] oh! Hydra with</i>
<i>  another flip.</i>

1:09:26.096 --> 1:09:27.495
Everybody's gonna
get sent up.

1:09:32.002 --> 1:09:33.034
Last year...

1:09:33.036 --> 1:09:34.769
<i> [chris] jake ewert and hydra</i>
<i>  have looked</i>

1:09:34.771 --> 1:09:37.105
<i>  unstoppable here</i>
<i>  in the tournament.</i>

1:09:38.074 --> 1:09:40.241
<i> [jake] every other match</i>
<i>  was super dominant.</i>

1:09:40.243 --> 1:09:41.309
<i>  Whiplash barely beat us.</i>

1:09:41.311 --> 1:09:43.144
<i> [chris] oh! Oh! Oh!</i>

1:09:43.146 --> 1:09:46.381
<i>  Hydra is suffering</i>
<i>  technical difficulty.</i>

1:09:46.383 --> 1:09:48.049
It's such a fluke, right?

1:09:48.051 --> 1:09:50.185
Whiplash!

1:09:50.187 --> 1:09:51.219
We did it.

1:09:51.221 --> 1:09:52.654
We know how it
should have ended.

1:09:55.425 --> 1:09:57.025
Nah, no way, shouldn't have
been in the final.

1:09:57.027 --> 1:09:58.493
Whiplash beat 'em
fair and square.

1:10:00.397 --> 1:10:03.031
Beating end game, this is
the statement right here.

1:10:03.033 --> 1:10:04.866
<i> [chris] world champion.</i>

1:10:04.868 --> 1:10:06.935
<i> [jake] if I beat</i>
<i>  the last year's champion,</i>

1:10:08.071 --> 1:10:09.637
what's the rest of
the competition gonna think?

1:10:12.475 --> 1:10:13.508
<i> [nick] hydra is a scary bot.</i>

1:10:13.510 --> 1:10:16.077
<i> [chris] hydra is coiled</i>
<i>  and ready to strike.</i>

1:10:16.079 --> 1:10:17.979
Especially for us,
who in the past

1:10:17.981 --> 1:10:20.348
have lost a lot,
upside down.

1:10:20.350 --> 1:10:22.016
<i> [chris] oh! A huge hit.</i>

1:10:22.018 --> 1:10:23.818
<i> [nick] we don't like to be</i>
<i>  flipped upside down</i>

1:10:23.820 --> 1:10:25.987
<i>  and hydra is so good at that.</i>

1:10:25.989 --> 1:10:29.657
<i> [chris] oh! Unbelievable</i>
<i>  hydra again.</i>

1:10:29.659 --> 1:10:31.559
They know that
they better be scared.

1:10:32.929 --> 1:10:34.796
<i>  I'm definitely looking</i>
<i>  for him to gyro left around,</i>

1:10:34.798 --> 1:10:37.065
and that's gonna give me
my in to get underneath him.

1:10:37.067 --> 1:10:38.967
<i> -[chris] oh!</i>
<i> -[nick] I think we're</i>
<i> coming here</i>

1:10:38.969 --> 1:10:40.568
every year to win
the giant nut.

1:10:44.007 --> 1:10:45.940
If we want to
start off this season

1:10:45.942 --> 1:10:47.475
the same way as we
finished last season,

1:10:48.378 --> 1:10:49.978
we've gotta beat hydra.

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:52.113
<i> [faruq] hydra!</i>

1:10:53.183 --> 1:10:54.315
They won the giant nut,

1:10:54.317 --> 1:10:56.651
<i>  so they should be confident</i>
<i>  that their bot works.</i>

1:10:59.189 --> 1:11:01.322
But they've also
seen my matches.

1:11:01.324 --> 1:11:04.058
<i> -[chris] whoa!</i>
<i> -[kenny] oh, my goodness.</i>

1:11:08.999 --> 1:11:11.065
<i> [faruq] it's tombstone!</i>

1:11:11.067 --> 1:11:13.635
<i> [chris] he hits you once</i>
<i>  and it could be all over.</i>

1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.073
<i> [faruq] it's hydra.</i>

1:11:19.075 --> 1:11:21.676
<i> [chris] oh, there's no mercy</i>
<i>  from hydra.</i>

1:11:21.678 --> 1:11:24.178
-You ready for this?
<i> -[chris] jake ewert talking</i>
<i>  some trash.</i>

1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:27.615
[jake] here it is. Here's
end game right there, buddy.

1:11:27.617 --> 1:11:30.251
[woman] do you like being
the villain of battlebots?

1:11:30.253 --> 1:11:31.886
I mean, at this point,
I know I am.

1:11:31.888 --> 1:11:33.488
<i>  So I might as well</i>
<i>  keep playing it, right?</i>

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:38.092
-I need you for a minute.
-Okay.

1:11:38.094 --> 1:11:40.628
Throughout the first
couple of seasons,

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:43.631
-I was the bad guy, I was
the villain of the show.
-Yeah.

1:11:43.633 --> 1:11:47.068
And that sort of
morphed last season,

1:11:47.070 --> 1:11:48.336
you were the villain
of the show.

1:11:48.338 --> 1:11:52.240
So I want to commemorate
this passing of the torch.

1:11:53.643 --> 1:11:54.942
And I made you a trophy.

1:11:56.146 --> 1:11:58.079
Oh, my god.
Look at that, guys.

1:11:58.081 --> 1:12:01.149
When the day comes that
you think this course
is passed on,

1:12:01.151 --> 1:12:02.884
you make them a trophy.

1:12:02.886 --> 1:12:04.385
-Gotcha.
I can do that.
-Fair enough?

1:12:04.387 --> 1:12:05.353
-All right.
-Thank you, sir.

1:12:05.355 --> 1:12:07.622
[laughter]

1:12:12.162 --> 1:12:13.995
<i> [chris] we are back</i>
<i>  on battlebots</i>

1:12:13.997 --> 1:12:16.030
<i>  for our main event</i>
<i>  of the evening</i>

1:12:16.032 --> 1:12:19.701
and the "champ is here."

1:12:19.703 --> 1:12:23.638
that's right. End game, led by
jack barker and nick mabey,

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:26.040
<i>  and we asked 'em,</i>
<i>  "hey, have your lives changed</i>

1:12:26.042 --> 1:12:27.542
<i>  since you claimed</i>
<i>  the giant nut?"</i>

1:12:27.544 --> 1:12:29.711
<i>  and they said, "not really."</i>

1:12:29.713 --> 1:12:31.746
<i> [kenny] it seemed like</i>
<i>  they were very stressed</i>
<i>  last season.</i>

1:12:31.748 --> 1:12:33.581
<i>  They put a lot</i>
<i>  of pressure on themself</i>

1:12:33.583 --> 1:12:35.149
<i>  to go out there</i>
<i>  and get the win,</i>

1:12:35.151 --> 1:12:36.984
<i>  and they were</i>
<i>  able to get it done,</i>

1:12:36.986 --> 1:12:38.486
<i>  which was just amazing.</i>

1:12:38.488 --> 1:12:40.888
<i>  So you think, well,</i>
<i>  now the weight is</i>
<i>  off their shoulders, right?</i>

1:12:40.890 --> 1:12:44.392
<i>  No, they actually stepped up</i>
<i>  their game yet again.</i>

1:12:44.394 --> 1:12:45.993
<i>  They said, they</i>
<i>  have a much stronger</i>

1:12:45.995 --> 1:12:47.228
<i>  bot this time out.</i>

1:12:47.230 --> 1:12:49.263
<i>  Even as champions,</i>
<i>  they learned a lot</i>

1:12:49.265 --> 1:12:50.631
<i>  and they did take some risks</i>

1:12:50.633 --> 1:12:52.033
<i>  to try to bring</i>
<i>  some new technology</i>

1:12:52.035 --> 1:12:53.634
<i>  in here this time around.</i>

1:12:53.636 --> 1:12:55.703
So I'm really excited
to see what kind of bot
they have here.

1:12:55.705 --> 1:12:56.738
Well, tonight
they're taking on

1:12:56.740 --> 1:12:59.807
jake ewert and team hydra.
And we asked jake,

1:12:59.809 --> 1:13:02.710
<i>  "hey, do you see end game</i>
<i>  in a different light</i>

1:13:02.712 --> 1:13:04.212
<i>  now that they're the champs?"</i>

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:07.648
and jake said, "nah,
they're the same old chumps

1:13:07.650 --> 1:13:09.150
they were a season ago."

1:13:09.219 --> 1:13:12.887
<i> [kenny] absolutely. He still</i>
<i>  has that giant chip</i>
<i>  on his shoulder.</i>

1:13:12.889 --> 1:13:15.022
<i>  I think he has</i>
<i>  another tremendous bot,</i>

1:13:15.024 --> 1:13:17.325
<i>  he says that this is</i>
<i>  the best bot</i>

1:13:17.327 --> 1:13:20.228
<i>  that the ewert clan</i>
<i>  has ever created.</i>

1:13:20.230 --> 1:13:22.163
<i>  Really curious to see,</i>
<i>  who many people believe</i>

1:13:22.165 --> 1:13:23.264
<i>  are the two favorites here,</i>

1:13:23.266 --> 1:13:24.932
<i>  going at it this early</i>
<i>  in the season.</i>

1:13:24.934 --> 1:13:26.901
Let's remember
that hydra didn't lose

1:13:26.903 --> 1:13:28.102
last regular season,

1:13:28.104 --> 1:13:29.337
was the number one
overall seed

1:13:29.339 --> 1:13:31.205
heading into the round of 32.

1:13:31.207 --> 1:13:32.874
Right now, they're
taking on the team

1:13:32.876 --> 1:13:35.109
that finished the season,
number one.

1:13:35.111 --> 1:13:36.444
Faruq.

1:13:41.384 --> 1:13:45.987
[faruq] ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

1:13:51.461 --> 1:13:55.396
It's time for the main event.

1:14:05.809 --> 1:14:10.645
In the red square, last year,
he had a buzz.

1:14:10.647 --> 1:14:13.915
He wondered would-he
hit the ceiling.

1:14:13.917 --> 1:14:16.184
He goes ham
and he wrecks bots,

1:14:16.186 --> 1:14:18.219
and that's how he's feeling.

1:14:18.221 --> 1:14:22.256
Those were toy story
references, in case
you didn't get their bar.

1:14:22.258 --> 1:14:25.026
And now this bot
will launch you

1:14:25.028 --> 1:14:28.863
into infinity and beyond.

1:14:28.865 --> 1:14:31.199
It's hydra!

1:14:31.201 --> 1:14:33.634
[cheers and applause]

1:14:33.636 --> 1:14:35.636
[dramatic music playing]

1:14:35.638 --> 1:14:38.439
<i> [chris] team hydra,</i>
<i>  nice little paint job.</i>

1:14:38.441 --> 1:14:39.974
<i>  Jake was telling us,</i>
<i>  he's getting</i>

1:14:39.976 --> 1:14:41.943
<i>  flipped up to almost 20 feet.</i>

1:14:41.945 --> 1:14:43.044
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  just ridiculous.</i>

1:14:43.046 --> 1:14:45.313
<i>  This was already</i>
<i>  the most powerful flipper</i>

1:14:45.315 --> 1:14:48.416
<i>  to ever get into the game.</i>
<i>  It's even more powerful.</i>

1:14:48.418 --> 1:14:50.351
<i>  Every year these guys</i>
<i>  step it up.</i>

1:14:50.353 --> 1:14:51.652
<i>  They want this giant nut.</i>

1:14:51.654 --> 1:14:52.920
<i>  If they don't get</i>
<i>  the giant nut,</i>

1:14:52.922 --> 1:14:54.489
<i>  it's not successful</i>
<i>  in their eyes.</i>

1:15:01.097 --> 1:15:04.398
In the blue square,
he comes from the land

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.068
that kept
peter jackson inspired.

1:15:07.070 --> 1:15:08.636
New zealand's still there,

1:15:08.638 --> 1:15:11.339
but this bot
burned down the shire.

1:15:11.341 --> 1:15:15.209
There's no fellowship,
no towers, no frodo, no ring,

1:15:15.211 --> 1:15:17.044
we're fighting for a nut

1:15:17.046 --> 1:15:20.081
and it's the return
of the king.

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:22.817
It's end game!

1:15:22.819 --> 1:15:25.219
[cheers and applause]

1:15:25.221 --> 1:15:27.989
[dramatic music playing]

1:15:29.492 --> 1:15:32.126
<i> [chris] the first ever</i>
<i>  international champion</i>

1:15:32.128 --> 1:15:34.328
<i>  in battlebots history.</i>

1:15:35.298 --> 1:15:38.633
<i>  Whoa! Some serious forkage.</i>

1:15:38.635 --> 1:15:40.234
<i> [kenny] easily</i>
<i>  the longest forks</i>

1:15:40.236 --> 1:15:42.069
<i>  we've ever seen</i>
<i>  from them, chris.</i>

1:15:42.071 --> 1:15:43.804
<i>  Against a bot like hydra,</i>

1:15:43.806 --> 1:15:46.173
<i>  it all comes down</i>
<i>  to the ground war.</i>

1:15:46.175 --> 1:15:48.242
<i>  And end game</i>
<i>  is hoping those forks</i>

1:15:48.244 --> 1:15:50.845
<i>  can keep the flipper</i>
<i>  out of striking range.</i>

1:15:50.847 --> 1:15:52.847
<i>  But should end game</i>
<i>  get flipped,</i>

1:15:52.849 --> 1:15:55.249
<i>  the only appendage</i>
<i>  that really matters</i>

1:15:55.251 --> 1:15:57.285
<i>  is the upgraded</i>
<i>  self-righting arm</i>

1:15:57.287 --> 1:15:58.986
<i>  on the back of the robot.</i>

1:16:09.165 --> 1:16:10.932
<i> [chris] if you're not</i>
<i>  making adjustments,</i>

1:16:10.934 --> 1:16:13.034
<i>  you're gonna get</i>
<i>  stuck in neutral.</i>

1:16:13.036 --> 1:16:14.635
<i>  For more on the champ,</i>
<i>  let's send it over</i>

1:16:14.637 --> 1:16:15.770
<i>  to the bot whisperer.</i>

1:16:15.772 --> 1:16:17.939
<i>  Pete, what do you have</i>
<i>  on end game?</i>

1:16:17.941 --> 1:16:19.774
<i> [pete] one of the things</i>
<i>  that happened with them,</i>

1:16:19.776 --> 1:16:22.410
they changed almost
everything inside that bot,

1:16:22.412 --> 1:16:25.079
all new electronics,
hardened everything.

1:16:25.081 --> 1:16:27.148
One of the other things
is they're rolling deep.

1:16:27.150 --> 1:16:31.218
<i>  They have eight discs,</i>
<i>  one for every fight</i>

1:16:31.220 --> 1:16:33.254
<i>  to be able to make it</i>
<i>  to the championship.</i>

1:16:33.256 --> 1:16:35.222
<i>  Also, across the way,</i>

1:16:35.224 --> 1:16:37.158
<i>  hydra's done some</i>
<i>  massive changes inside,</i>

1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:38.993
<i>  they've added</i>
<i>  some oil filtration</i>

1:16:38.995 --> 1:16:41.963
<i>  so that the hydraulic system</i>
<i>  will not jam up</i>

1:16:41.965 --> 1:16:43.831
<i>  and have problems</i>
<i>  with its valves,</i>

1:16:43.833 --> 1:16:46.901
and get sticking when
they're trying to flip.

1:16:46.903 --> 1:16:49.236
<i> [chris] and of course, that's</i>
<i>  the issue hydra ran into</i>

1:16:49.238 --> 1:16:51.339
<i>  in last year's tournament.</i>

1:16:51.341 --> 1:16:55.076
<i>  Our bot whisperer, always</i>
<i>  bringing the goods.</i>

1:16:55.078 --> 1:16:58.012

1:17:13.930 --> 1:17:16.263
[robotic voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

1:17:18.301 --> 1:17:21.535
[cheers and applause]

1:17:23.106 --> 1:17:25.006
[robotic voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

1:17:25.775 --> 1:17:28.476
[cheers and applause]

1:17:43.459 --> 1:17:47.028
[crowd chanting] fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:17:52.001 --> 1:17:53.567
[speaks indinstinctly]

1:18:01.344 --> 1:18:03.844
<i> [chris] let</i>
<i>  the bot battle begin.</i>

1:18:03.846 --> 1:18:07.181
<i>  Those bots inching carefully</i>
<i>  out of their squares.</i>

1:18:07.183 --> 1:18:09.617
<i>  End game's front forks and</i>
<i>  hydra's wedge,</i>

1:18:09.619 --> 1:18:11.285
<i>  so low to the ground.</i>

1:18:12.321 --> 1:18:14.088
<i>  Hydra gets hung up.</i>

1:18:14.090 --> 1:18:17.258
<i>  Now looking to engage,</i>
<i>  gets underneath end game.</i>

1:18:17.260 --> 1:18:18.959
<i>  Whoa! Whoa!</i>

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:23.130
<i>  Look at that. Hydra airlines</i>
<i>  is back in business, baby.</i>

1:18:23.132 --> 1:18:25.900
[kenny]
<i>  end game, fortunate</i>
<i>  to land right side up</i>

1:18:25.902 --> 1:18:27.101
<i>  after that flip, chris.</i>

1:18:27.103 --> 1:18:30.104
<i> [chris] absolutely, but hydra</i>
<i>  may actually be smokin'.</i>

1:18:30.106 --> 1:18:31.205
<i> [kenny] look at that,</i>
<i>  that flipper</i>

1:18:31.207 --> 1:18:33.340
<i>  might be stuck</i>
<i>  in the up position.</i>

1:18:33.342 --> 1:18:35.743
<i>  [chris] ow, that could be</i>
<i>  tragic for hydra,</i>

1:18:35.745 --> 1:18:38.179
<i>  which got one great flip in.</i>

1:18:38.181 --> 1:18:42.450
<i>  Oh! End game, bullying hydra</i>
<i>  in the corner now.</i>

1:18:42.452 --> 1:18:45.019
<i> [kenny] jake ewert has to</i>
<i>  gather himself here.</i>

1:18:45.021 --> 1:18:46.687
<i> Even if that flipper is stuck,</i>

1:18:46.689 --> 1:18:48.823
<i>  hydra is still the lower bot</i>

1:18:48.825 --> 1:18:52.860
<i>  and it can use that advantage</i>
<i>  to stay in this match, chris.</i>

1:18:52.862 --> 1:18:54.562
<i> [chris] that beak doing</i>
<i>  a pretty good job</i>

1:18:54.564 --> 1:18:56.130
<i>  of holding end game at bay.</i>

1:18:56.132 --> 1:18:59.867
<i>  And there goes one of the</i>
<i>  front forks of the end game.</i>

1:18:59.869 --> 1:19:01.969
-[man] try to escape.
-I'm trying.

1:19:01.971 --> 1:19:03.070
[kenny]
<i>  without that flipper,</i>

1:19:03.072 --> 1:19:04.872
<i>  hydra is gonna have</i>
<i>  to find a way</i>

1:19:04.874 --> 1:19:07.975
<i>  to use its wedge</i>
<i>  to upend end game.</i>

1:19:07.977 --> 1:19:10.478
<i>  Use that vertical spinner's</i>
<i>  energy against itself.</i>

1:19:12.215 --> 1:19:14.181
<i> [chris] but here come</i>
<i>  the champs.</i>

1:19:14.183 --> 1:19:16.150
<i> [kenny] oh, what a shot!</i>

1:19:16.152 --> 1:19:18.018
<i> -[chris] whoo!</i>
<i> -Everything's smoking.</i>

1:19:18.020 --> 1:19:19.987
<i> [chris] was that</i>
<i>  a knockout shot?</i>

1:19:19.989 --> 1:19:23.257
<i>  Jake ewert's bot's</i>
<i>  stunned and leaking smoke.</i>

1:19:23.259 --> 1:19:24.959
<i>  End game is celebrating.</i>

1:19:24.961 --> 1:19:26.127
[referee] ten...

1:19:26.129 --> 1:19:27.862
<i> -[chris] and here</i>
<i>  comes the countdown.</i>
<i> -Nine,...</i>

1:19:27.864 --> 1:19:31.132
-Eight, seven, six...
<i> -[chris] and the opening night</i>
<i>  test for the defending champ</i>

1:19:31.134 --> 1:19:35.169
-five, four, three, two, one.
<i> -[chris] is gonna end with</i>
<i>  a victory over hydra.</i>

1:19:35.171 --> 1:19:37.004
[referee] that's it.
Winner, end game.

1:19:37.006 --> 1:19:38.606
[cheers and applause]

1:19:38.608 --> 1:19:39.707
<i> [chris] wow!</i>

1:19:46.015 --> 1:19:47.815
[chris]
<i>  kenny, get</i>
<i>  a good look at the flip</i>

1:19:47.817 --> 1:19:50.918
<i>  because it's the only one</i>
<i>  that hydra was able to get.</i>

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:53.754
<i> [kenny] whoo! Well, it was</i>
<i>  a beautiful one and hydra</i>

1:19:53.756 --> 1:19:56.023
<i>  looked to be the lower bot</i>
<i>  out of the game,</i>

1:19:56.025 --> 1:19:57.858
<i>  which would have spelled</i>
<i>  big trouble for end game,</i>

1:19:57.860 --> 1:20:01.362
<i>  if jake ewert's bot hadn't</i>
<i>  lost function in its flipper.</i>

1:20:01.364 --> 1:20:03.864
<i> [chris] once that happened,</i>
<i>  the defending champs</i>

1:20:03.866 --> 1:20:05.766
<i>  knew they could</i>
<i>  take their time,</i>

1:20:05.768 --> 1:20:07.334
<i>  they backed hydra down</i>

1:20:07.336 --> 1:20:09.170
<i>  with that powerful</i>
<i>  drive train</i>

1:20:09.172 --> 1:20:11.438
<i>  and delivered</i>
<i>  the death blow.</i>

1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:13.607
<i>  End game gets in</i>
<i>  the win column.</i>

1:20:17.113 --> 1:20:18.946
<i> [man] whoo!</i>

1:20:18.948 --> 1:20:22.783
[chris] all right, champs,
was that a perfect first
fight for you guys?

1:20:22.785 --> 1:20:25.853
Actually, like, he seemed
to have problems at the...

1:20:25.855 --> 1:20:28.255
At the beginning, it would
have been really nice
to face 'em,

1:20:28.257 --> 1:20:30.157
uh, you know,
properly fully working.

1:20:30.159 --> 1:20:31.258
He gave that one big flip.

1:20:31.260 --> 1:20:32.893
We got... Got some good air.

1:20:32.895 --> 1:20:34.161
Yeah, that was a good flip.

1:20:34.163 --> 1:20:36.063
But it was clearly, it
was clearly an issue
from the beginning

1:20:36.065 --> 1:20:37.765
that we didn't cause.
And I don't like that.

1:20:37.767 --> 1:20:39.266
You guys came out
with eight forks,

1:20:39.268 --> 1:20:41.669
we've never seen that
from team end game.

1:20:41.671 --> 1:20:43.938
Was that just
for this match against hydra?

1:20:43.940 --> 1:20:45.973
-Yeah.
-Or is this something you're
gonna do going forward?

1:20:45.975 --> 1:20:49.376
So I mean, hydra is all about
the ground game as well.

1:20:49.378 --> 1:20:51.846
He has been, you know,
phenomenal in the past

1:20:51.848 --> 1:20:53.347
about getting under opponents.

1:20:53.349 --> 1:20:55.416
So, like we had to
pull out all the stops.

1:20:55.418 --> 1:20:57.251
I... I like
the new outfits, guys.

1:20:57.253 --> 1:20:58.319
Everyone has a suit here.

1:20:58.321 --> 1:21:00.287
Is this all business
for end game?

1:21:00.289 --> 1:21:01.856
Is this what this is about?

1:21:01.858 --> 1:21:03.524
I mean, you've
gotta look the part.

1:21:06.062 --> 1:21:08.229
All right, guys, you're off
to a nice 1-0 start,

1:21:08.231 --> 1:21:10.898
I'm sure that is a relief.
Congratulations.

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:12.333
[man] it is.

1:21:12.335 --> 1:21:15.135
[cheers and applause]

1:21:18.741 --> 1:21:20.374
all right, jake, pretty
simple question here,

1:21:20.376 --> 1:21:22.109
I don't know if
it's a simple answer,

1:21:22.111 --> 1:21:23.777
but what happened
to the robot?

1:21:23.779 --> 1:21:25.279
Oh, the pump burned out

1:21:25.281 --> 1:21:26.347
right after that first flip.

1:21:26.349 --> 1:21:27.848
That's what the smoke was,

1:21:27.850 --> 1:21:29.617
so the arm stays up
and then it's just

1:21:29.619 --> 1:21:31.986
a driving battle after that,
and I can't win that.

1:21:31.988 --> 1:21:34.088
He's eventually gonna
hit me, so...

1:21:34.090 --> 1:21:36.190
It's nice to lose, at least
to the champion.

1:21:36.192 --> 1:21:39.260
So the loss does not
matter as bad as,

1:21:39.262 --> 1:21:40.361
you know, somebody else.

1:21:40.363 --> 1:21:42.229
So, I'm okay with it.

1:21:42.231 --> 1:21:43.898
And it looks like
my frame is still intact,

1:21:43.900 --> 1:21:45.266
so it's... It's
all good right now.

1:21:45.268 --> 1:21:47.134
So this is something
in your mind that you feel

1:21:47.136 --> 1:21:49.203
that can be fixed, this
isn't a major concern

1:21:49.205 --> 1:21:51.939
-for you at this point?
-It's the first failure
we ever had like this,

1:21:51.941 --> 1:21:54.942
so we'll have to go back
and look what actually broke.

1:21:54.944 --> 1:21:57.611
But, I mean, we were
coming in pretty confident.

1:21:57.613 --> 1:22:00.781
And maybe this keeled me
back just a little bit,

1:22:00.783 --> 1:22:02.349
you know, it took that
chip off my shoulder.

1:22:02.351 --> 1:22:05.920
But, uh, I mean, the next guy
better be ready for me.

1:22:05.922 --> 1:22:07.821
Jake, did it really take
the chip off your shoulder?

1:22:07.823 --> 1:22:09.623
No. Never will, never will.

1:22:11.027 --> 1:22:12.660
All right, jake, I'm sure
you'll fix up hydra

1:22:12.662 --> 1:22:14.962
and we will see you in
your next match. Thank you.

1:22:20.202 --> 1:22:22.469
<i> [chris] well, you</i>
<i>  heard it from jack barker</i>
<i>  and nick mabey</i>

1:22:22.471 --> 1:22:24.605
that they wanted to see hydra

1:22:24.607 --> 1:22:26.140
all the way at 100%.

1:22:26.142 --> 1:22:29.043
<i>  But rest assured, in</i>
<i>  a competition this grueling,</i>

1:22:29.045 --> 1:22:30.878
<i>  they will take that win</i>

1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:34.148
<i>  and run to an all important</i>
<i>  1-0 start.</i>

1:22:35.217 --> 1:22:37.851
Big picture here tonight,
sawblaze off to a nice start

1:22:37.853 --> 1:22:39.486
<i>  winning a unanimous decision.</i>

1:22:39.488 --> 1:22:41.288
<i>  But I got to tell you,</i>
<i>  minotaur is back</i>

1:22:41.290 --> 1:22:44.959
<i>  and despite a loss,</i>
<i>  looks absolutely determined.</i>

1:22:44.961 --> 1:22:47.962
<i>  Fan favorites</i>
<i>  free shipping and blacksmith</i>

1:22:47.964 --> 1:22:49.763
<i>  made their triumphant,</i>
<i>  not to mention</i>

1:22:49.765 --> 1:22:52.232
<i>  fiery, return to the box</i>
<i>  after a year away.</i>

1:22:52.234 --> 1:22:55.235
<i>  What a show they</i>
<i>  put on for the crowd.</i>

1:22:55.237 --> 1:22:58.038
<i>  And a shocker seeing</i>
<i>  ray billings kick off</i>

1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:00.341
<i>  his season with an upset loss</i>

1:23:00.343 --> 1:23:02.943
<i>  at the hands</i>
<i>  of captain shrederator.</i>

1:23:02.945 --> 1:23:04.445
<i>  Good luck to whichever team</i>

1:23:04.447 --> 1:23:08.182
<i>  draws an angry tombstone</i>
<i>  in the next matchup.</i>

1:23:09.485 --> 1:23:11.285
Great first night.
We are off and running

1:23:11.287 --> 1:23:13.721
in the 2021 season.

1:23:13.723 --> 1:23:16.357
So for faruq
and our bot whisperer pete,

1:23:16.359 --> 1:23:18.926
and my man, kenny florian,
I am chris rose.

1:23:18.928 --> 1:23:21.395
We'll see you
next time, on battlebots.
