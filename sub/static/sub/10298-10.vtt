01:18.968 --> 01:21.100
I work in a shoe store,

01:21.100 --> 01:23.767
and still I'm not happy
to come home.

01:26.901 --> 01:29.767
Mr. Bundy,
wanna buy some
chipmunk cookies?

01:29.767 --> 01:31.400
No. Go away.

01:33.434 --> 01:36.200
You can't tell me
you're not hungry.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.968
My daddy says you eat
bugs and dirt.

01:42.067 --> 01:44.000
Well, you go home
and tell your daddy,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.567
you have
the mailman's eyes.

01:48.868 --> 01:51.367
It's food.

01:51.367 --> 01:53.234
All right.

01:53.234 --> 01:55.634
Gimme a box
of these macaroons.

01:55.634 --> 01:58.801
Cash only...deadbeat.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.067
I don't have any cash.
Give me some credit.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.267
Eat a bug.

02:05.534 --> 02:07.367
Wet a bed.

02:10.868 --> 02:12.534
Ah, jeez.

02:19.367 --> 02:20.534
"Dear Al...

02:21.701 --> 02:24.200
"you always complain
there's no dinner.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.434
Surprise. I left it
on the table for you."

02:32.634 --> 02:36.634
You ate my dinner,
you bag of fleas
and ticks.

02:36.634 --> 02:37.901
I'm starving.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.667
Hi, honey.

02:51.667 --> 02:54.167
Oh, Al, we had
such a great day.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.334
Steve took us all
to the zoo.

02:56.334 --> 02:58.734
And Al, it was
the best time to go.

02:58.734 --> 03:00.300
No lines or anything.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.133
Because, you know,
during the day,

03:02.133 --> 03:04.701
all the idiots
who have jobs
can't go.

03:05.767 --> 03:07.300
[LAUGHING]

03:09.467 --> 03:11.400
Dad, you'll never
guess what we saw

03:11.400 --> 03:12.934
at the zoo today,
with Uncle Steve.

03:12.934 --> 03:17.067
A family of vultures
pecking the flesh of the daddy?

03:17.067 --> 03:20.067
No. A big gorilla,
big as you,

03:20.067 --> 03:22.667
scratching himself.

03:22.667 --> 03:26.467
Yeah, and he had
one hand where
his pants would be.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.167
And in his other hand--

03:28.167 --> 03:30.033
You know how you hold
your beer?

03:30.033 --> 03:32.000
Well, he was holding
something.

03:34.434 --> 03:36.200
I think
it was doody.

03:39.934 --> 03:43.434
Where were you
around 3:00 today?

03:44.868 --> 03:47.167
You know, my favorite part
was the penguin cage.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.701
It really makes you think.

03:48.701 --> 03:51.701
There, but for
the flippers, go I.

03:57.334 --> 04:00.067
Well, the flippers
and a breakaway bra.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.234
You know, you should be
nice to me.

04:04.234 --> 04:06.334
If I hadn't told
the guard that you
were with us,

04:06.334 --> 04:08.501
you'd be riding
a unicycle and
clapping for fish

04:08.501 --> 04:09.501
right about now.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.200
[DOORBELL
RINGS]

04:13.200 --> 04:14.834
Oh, my God,
I'll bet that's Marcie.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.934
I was supposed to be out
looking for a job today.

04:16.934 --> 04:21.200
If she smells fun on me,
I'm a dead man.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
Stall her.

04:24.701 --> 04:27.033
Pretty pathetic, huh?

04:27.033 --> 04:30.701
You know, I don't think Steve
has what it takes not to work.

04:30.701 --> 04:32.634
He almost seems ashamed of it.

04:32.634 --> 04:33.734
I'll tell you what:

04:33.734 --> 04:36.434
If I ever get like that,
shoot me.

04:36.434 --> 04:39.000
Uh, in case I'm not here
when that happens,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.367
can I just wing you now?

04:42.534 --> 04:43.834
Oh, hi, Marcie.

04:43.834 --> 04:47.434
I went to the zoo today
with the kids,
and nobody else.

04:47.434 --> 04:48.834
How was your day?

04:48.834 --> 04:50.000
Superb.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.234
Since I got demoted
to drive-up teller,

04:52.234 --> 04:56.000
everything is just
so much more exciting.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.567
It's a people job.

04:57.567 --> 05:00.067
They drive up
to my window,

05:00.067 --> 05:03.300
order a cheeseburger...
spit at me

05:03.300 --> 05:05.200
and drive away.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.400
But they're not all
like that.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.267
Some of them actually try
to pull my hand

05:09.267 --> 05:10.300
through the chute

05:10.300 --> 05:12.334
before they spit at me
and drive away.

05:12.334 --> 05:16.534
So, between that and the cheery
"Hurry up, you stupid moo-cow,"

05:16.534 --> 05:20.901
the 50-hour workweek
just seems to zoom by.

05:20.901 --> 05:22.901
Don't let them
bother you, Marcie.

05:22.901 --> 05:27.400
Ignore them, chew your cud
and hold your horns up high.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.501
Boy, what a day.

05:36.501 --> 05:38.667
Oh, Marcie...

05:38.667 --> 05:40.834
I didn't expect to see
you here.

05:41.934 --> 05:44.033
Oh, damn.

05:44.033 --> 05:46.567
I wish I could've
been home in time
to cook you dinner.

05:46.567 --> 05:48.701
Ah, I'm such
a failure.

05:48.701 --> 05:51.234
Oh. No, honey,
it's ok.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.167
Did you find anything
today, angel heart?

05:54.167 --> 05:55.334
Oh, no.

05:55.334 --> 05:57.834
Not from lack of trying.

05:57.834 --> 05:59.334
I've heard it all:

05:59.334 --> 06:02.234
Too old, too young,
too handsome.

06:02.234 --> 06:04.200
Put your
feet up, folks.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.767
Getting pretty
deep in here.

06:05.767 --> 06:08.200
Shh!

06:08.200 --> 06:11.334
Oh, well,
you come on home,
Steve.

06:11.334 --> 06:12.801
I'll rub your feet
for you.

06:12.801 --> 06:14.734
They must be tired
from walking all day.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.367
Oh, but dear,
you work so hard.

06:16.367 --> 06:18.100
But...okay.

06:19.167 --> 06:21.400
Hey, Mr. Rhoades,
before you go,

06:21.400 --> 06:23.133
I have a zoo question for you.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.100
When you were riding
the little train

06:25.100 --> 06:26.434
around Bear Land today,

06:26.434 --> 06:28.133
were there any
real-live teddy bears,

06:28.133 --> 06:29.334
like Bud said?

06:29.334 --> 06:32.434
Or do they live someplace else,
like I think?

06:37.968 --> 06:40.267
Uh, Marcie, I can't go on
keeping secrets from you.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.334
I was at the zoo today

06:41.334 --> 06:43.834
and I really didn't
look for anything.

06:43.834 --> 06:45.000
Well, good, Steve.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.300
Tonight when we're
in bed together,

06:47.300 --> 06:49.467
don't look for anything
there, either.

06:51.968 --> 06:54.734
Well, then I guess
you won't take
this well, either.

06:55.467 --> 06:56.801
I've been thinking.

06:57.934 --> 07:00.000
I don't really
want to work.

07:01.334 --> 07:02.667
It's boring.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.834
I'm having fun not working.
Peggy says--

07:04.834 --> 07:08.434
Well, Marcie says,
you're working, leech-man.

07:10.334 --> 07:13.100
Now...on the slim
chance

07:13.100 --> 07:14.667
you weren't going to do
squat today,

07:14.667 --> 07:16.334
which you didn't,

07:16.334 --> 07:17.501
I called
your former boss

07:17.501 --> 07:20.067
on my lunch
six minutes...

07:20.067 --> 07:21.801
and he agreed
to see you.

07:21.801 --> 07:23.901
So, if you could put on
a clean suit,

07:23.901 --> 07:25.634
brush those teeth,

07:25.634 --> 07:29.601
and put on
some cologne to cover up
that wombat smell...

07:29.601 --> 07:31.801
he'll see you
tomorrow afternoon.

07:31.801 --> 07:33.634
I will meet you there

07:33.634 --> 07:35.634
to make sure you say,
"I'll take it,"

07:35.634 --> 07:38.067
to any menial job
that's tossed your way.

07:38.067 --> 07:41.033
Well, I'm afraid tomorrow
doesn't work for me.

07:41.033 --> 07:43.801
I told Peggy and the kids
I'd take them to the aquarium.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.968
Well, dear...
I'm afraid

07:46.968 --> 07:49.133
you'll be rather
uncomfortable
at the aquarium

07:49.133 --> 07:50.267
with my foot lodged

07:50.267 --> 07:52.033
where mommy used to put
the thermometer.

07:54.634 --> 07:56.300
You know, Peg,

07:56.300 --> 07:58.033
seeing Marcie take charge
like that

07:58.033 --> 07:59.734
reminds me of what
a real man should be.

07:59.734 --> 08:01.501
So, I'm putting
my foot down.

08:01.501 --> 08:03.501
Tomorrow, when I come home,
I want my slippers,

08:03.501 --> 08:05.634
I want my paper,
before Buck.

08:05.634 --> 08:09.501
I want my dinner,
again, before Buck.

08:09.501 --> 08:11.067
I am the Marcie
of this house.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.901
I have spoken.

08:12.901 --> 08:15.567
So it is written.
So it shall be done.

08:18.434 --> 08:21.000
"Place cheese critters in water,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.100
"and watch them grow.

08:25.601 --> 08:28.100
Keep out of reach of children."

08:36.433 --> 08:38.167
Oh, hi, honey.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.734
You should've been
with us today.

08:39.734 --> 08:41.634
We had
a great time.

08:41.634 --> 08:43.400
Yeah, we fed a shark
a hamburger,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.300
and then they gave
a French fry to this guppy,

08:45.300 --> 08:46.868
and he exploded.

08:46.868 --> 08:49.367
And Dad,
they had those
great hot dogs

08:49.367 --> 08:50.501
that you like so much.

08:50.501 --> 08:52.067
Mom put one
on each side of her mouth

08:52.067 --> 08:53.634
and pretended
like she was a walrus.

08:55.133 --> 08:59.033
Does anyone care
that I haven't eaten in days?

08:59.033 --> 09:00.534
I haven't really
thought about it.

09:00.534 --> 09:02.300
Not too much.
Not really, no.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.834
You look a little down,
Steve.

09:04.834 --> 09:05.968
What's wrong?

09:05.968 --> 09:08.968
The choo-choo
through Toyland
shut down?

09:08.968 --> 09:11.434
Worse than that, Al.

09:11.434 --> 09:12.834
It's Bosco.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.567
You have some Bosco?

09:14.567 --> 09:18.334
Well, let me spit
in a glass, and we'll
mix it up.

09:18.334 --> 09:21.000
No. I mean, Bosco,
the rare Caribbean

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
pygmy sea turtle
at the aquarium.

09:25.501 --> 09:27.667
He looked
really despondent today.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.667
Was he selling shoes
to the other turtles?

09:32.167 --> 09:34.000
No.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.968
They have him
in an itty-bitty tank.

09:35.968 --> 09:37.734
He must weigh
200 pounds.

09:37.734 --> 09:39.133
He's as out of place
in that tank

09:39.133 --> 09:40.868
as you would be
in a library.

09:42.234 --> 09:44.367
Like a trouper,
he kept his beak up.

09:44.367 --> 09:45.968
But I could tell...

09:45.968 --> 09:49.033
he was just a shell
of a turtle.

09:49.033 --> 09:50.834
You should've
seen them, Al.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.901
Both of their
little noses pressed up
against the glass.

09:53.901 --> 09:56.300
You could barely
tell them apart.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.534
No, the turtle
is the one
with the job.

10:02.701 --> 10:04.200
Oh, that's right!

10:04.200 --> 10:05.767
I was supposed to
meet Marcie

10:05.767 --> 10:06.767
at my old
bank today.

10:06.767 --> 10:07.968
Ugh!

10:07.968 --> 10:10.667
Oh, man. Mrs. Rhoades
is gonna gut you

10:10.667 --> 10:12.133
like a fish.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.300
Hey, hey, hey.
I can handle
Mrs. Rhoades.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.901
I'll just give her
what she's been
begging for all week:

10:17.901 --> 10:21.000
my famous
chocolate soufflé.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.133
Yeah, it takes
a good two hours,

10:25.133 --> 10:27.434
but a man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

10:29.434 --> 10:31.167
<i>A drug-crazed gunman</i>

10:31.167 --> 10:33.133
<i>attempted to rob
the Leading Bank of Chicago</i>

10:33.133 --> 10:34.434
<i>this afternoon.</i>

10:34.434 --> 10:37.167
<i>His attempt was foiled
by a feisty local woman,</i>

10:37.167 --> 10:38.501
<i>Marcie Rhoades,</i>

10:38.501 --> 10:40.434
<i>whom he tried to seize
as a hostage.</i>

10:40.434 --> 10:43.467
<i>But he picked
the wrong woman,
didn't he, Mrs. Rhoades?</i>

10:45.300 --> 10:48.067
Is that gunshot wound
through your hand
bothering you?

10:49.367 --> 10:51.501
Not really, Waldo.

10:51.501 --> 10:54.901
What's bothering me is,
my husband is a screwup.

10:58.267 --> 11:01.968
You went to
the zoo again today,
didn't you, Steve?

11:04.601 --> 11:07.834
That soufflé better be
damn fluffy.

11:12.834 --> 11:15.901
Exactly how did
you apprehend
the criminal?

11:15.901 --> 11:20.100
Well...when the robber
jammed his gun in my stomach,

11:20.100 --> 11:22.534
I did what I felt
I had to do.

11:22.534 --> 11:24.834
I threw up on the floor.

11:24.834 --> 11:29.267
As he slipped on it,
he knocked himself out.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.868
But the gun went off
and shot me through the hand,

11:31.868 --> 11:33.868
horribly wounding me.

11:33.868 --> 11:37.367
But enough about me.
How was your day, Steve?!

11:40.367 --> 11:42.934
Well...guess
I'll go home,

11:42.934 --> 11:45.033
get my stuff
and head for the Y.

11:45.033 --> 11:47.601
Listen, if she comes over here,
you haven't seen me.

11:47.601 --> 11:50.067
Uh...tell her I'm out
looking for a job.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.434
She'll buy it.

11:51.434 --> 11:53.934
After all, she's probably
loaded full of painkillers.

11:53.934 --> 11:55.567
Tee-hee.
Oh, hi!

11:57.100 --> 11:58.133
Hi, Marcie.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.400
I was just out, uh,
looking for a job.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.534
So, what's up?

12:02.534 --> 12:04.334
See this hand,
Steve?

12:04.334 --> 12:05.334
Yeah.

12:05.334 --> 12:06.467
See this one?

12:12.567 --> 12:16.167
Gee,
this, kind of,
puts the kibosh

12:16.167 --> 12:17.667
on the sailboat
trip tomorrow,

12:17.667 --> 12:19.067
doesn't it?

12:27.567 --> 12:30.067
Thanks for bringing
me here, Al.

12:30.067 --> 12:33.100
I'm sorry you had to
see me like that.

12:33.100 --> 12:37.534
I usually pride myself
on being a lady at all times.

12:37.534 --> 12:39.267
Hey, lard butt!

12:40.701 --> 12:43.267
A couple of brewskis
over here.

12:43.267 --> 12:46.501
Hey, guys!
A toast.

12:46.501 --> 12:47.868
To the working man.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.767
The last American
hero.

12:49.767 --> 12:50.767
Right, guys?

12:50.767 --> 12:52.000
ALL:
Right.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.667
We work to make
a living,

12:53.667 --> 12:54.701
and what
do we get?

12:54.701 --> 12:57.367
ALL:
Squat.

12:57.367 --> 12:58.901
And what else?

12:58.901 --> 13:00.501
ALL:
Nothing.

13:00.501 --> 13:01.901
Why do we
go on?

13:01.901 --> 13:04.467
ALL:
We're stupid.

13:04.467 --> 13:07.300
A toast to the stupid
working man.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.100
ALL:
To us.

13:10.567 --> 13:13.567
Do you know what really
frosts my weenie?

13:16.100 --> 13:18.100
After you marry them,

13:18.100 --> 13:20.100
they don't care
how they look.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.634
Don't even shave,
right, guys?

13:22.634 --> 13:24.634
Right.
Yeah,
sure.

13:25.634 --> 13:27.300
Well, I can't complain.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.534
At least, I live with one
who has a job, makes me dinner

13:30.534 --> 13:33.334
and doesn't mind rubbing my feet
after a hard day.

13:33.334 --> 13:36.167
Yeah, but your mom's
getting kind of old.

13:38.467 --> 13:41.133
Besides, moms aren't
really women.

13:41.133 --> 13:43.133
I'm talking about
the things you marry.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.501
I mean,
when you come--

13:46.100 --> 13:48.634
I mean, when you come
crawling home after
a hard day,

13:48.634 --> 13:49.634
what do they want?

13:49.634 --> 13:51.133
ALL:
Loving.

13:51.133 --> 13:53.434
They don't understand
it's just more work
for us.

13:53.434 --> 13:56.701
I mean...the last thing
a guy wants to look at

13:56.701 --> 13:58.267
at the end of a day
is a woman.

13:58.267 --> 14:00.434
Hey, look at
that one.

14:00.434 --> 14:02.400
ALL:
Ooh!

14:02.400 --> 14:03.667
Hey, Al,

14:03.667 --> 14:05.901
you know what else
ticks me off?

14:05.901 --> 14:07.834
It's the way
they change.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.634
I mean, when
I first married Steve,

14:09.634 --> 14:12.901
he was a greedy,
materialistic pig.

14:12.901 --> 14:16.300
He'd step on
an old lady
for a dollar.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.667
[LAUGHS]
God, how he excited me.

14:19.968 --> 14:21.968
Now, he's just
another man,

14:21.968 --> 14:25.200
with sea horses
on his boxer shorts.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.567
Oh, Al...what if Steve
never works again?

14:30.033 --> 14:31.400
Lock yourself
in the bathroom

14:31.400 --> 14:32.634
and don't have kids.

14:33.834 --> 14:36.067
Hey, guys.
Kids!

14:36.067 --> 14:38.334
ALL:
Boo.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.567
Case in point:

14:40.567 --> 14:43.067
See that old man
in the corner there?

14:48.634 --> 14:50.467
Neil Cockran.
Eight kids.

14:50.467 --> 14:52.534
He's 30 years old.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.601
Steve and I talked
about having children.

14:59.601 --> 15:02.100
God, can you imagine
that life?

15:02.100 --> 15:04.100
You, the only
working parent,

15:04.100 --> 15:06.200
a couple of kids
chained to your wallet.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.434
Ugh!

15:07.434 --> 15:10.067
I'd rather have a knife
plunged in my throat.

15:15.567 --> 15:16.934
Sorry.

15:16.934 --> 15:20.200
Oh. I guess what's really
bothering me here

15:20.200 --> 15:22.601
about Steve is that,
not only are we not talking,

15:22.601 --> 15:25.467
but this is the first time
in our relationship

15:25.467 --> 15:27.267
I've kept secrets
from him.

15:27.267 --> 15:29.534
I mean, I'm keeping
something from him
right now,

15:29.534 --> 15:32.634
even though I know
it's wrong.

15:32.634 --> 15:35.968
Oh, Al. Maybe you can
help me handle this.

15:41.701 --> 15:43.701
Wait a minute here,
Marce.

15:43.701 --> 15:47.467
I know you look at me
and just see hunk, but--

15:50.667 --> 15:52.968
You're not the first
who tried to bag the big one.

15:52.968 --> 15:54.334
But, uh...

15:57.667 --> 16:00.033
It can never be.
I belong to another.

16:00.033 --> 16:03.367
And, more importantly,
I find you physically
repulsive.

16:06.934 --> 16:10.100
I don't want you,
you shaved ape.

16:11.501 --> 16:14.234
Hey, no need to
get personal,
chicken legs.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.934
Anyhow...

16:17.934 --> 16:20.367
you remember when I...

16:20.367 --> 16:22.701
sort of caught
that bank robber?

16:22.701 --> 16:25.534
Well, what I didn't
tell Steve is that they...

16:25.534 --> 16:28.267
sort of gave me
a little reward.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.968
How much?

16:29.968 --> 16:32.601
Twenty five thousand
dollars.

16:35.801 --> 16:37.968
Hey, barkeep.

16:37.968 --> 16:41.968
A whiskey for the lady
and a deck of cards for me.

16:43.567 --> 16:47.767
Boy, it's really scary
being unconscious.

16:47.767 --> 16:50.067
The things you imagine.

16:50.067 --> 16:54.667
I thought two little
leprechauns and
a redheaded giant

16:54.667 --> 16:56.167
were going through
my pockets.

17:03.834 --> 17:08.467
Then a woman
with a mustache gave me
a big French kiss.

17:09.434 --> 17:10.767
That was Buck.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.968
He thought your tongue
was his chew rag.

17:19.267 --> 17:23.334
Well...I can't go
through life getting
knocked out.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.467
I guess there's no way
around it.

17:25.467 --> 17:27.166
Marcie wants me
to get a job,

17:27.166 --> 17:28.901
I guess I have to
get a job.

17:28.901 --> 17:31.200
Oh, forget about
Marcie for a minute.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.601
What do you want to do?

17:33.434 --> 17:34.934
I want to be
a cowboy.

17:36.334 --> 17:40.267
Well...let's just say
that all the cowboy jobs

17:40.267 --> 17:41.634
were taken by men.

17:41.634 --> 17:42.767
[LAUGHS]

17:44.601 --> 17:46.267
What's your second
choice?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.868
Well...

17:48.868 --> 17:51.934
I was hoping to do
something special,

17:51.934 --> 17:54.367
something that's been
on my mind all day.

17:54.367 --> 17:56.434
But I don't have
the nerve.

17:56.434 --> 18:00.300
I know you look at me
and just see man candy.

18:05.267 --> 18:07.300
But it can never be.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.501
First, I belong
to another.

18:09.501 --> 18:12.367
And, second,
ha, ha, ha...

18:14.067 --> 18:16.367
you couldn't
handle the ride.

18:27.901 --> 18:30.300
I can't even
handle the thought.

18:33.934 --> 18:36.701
Ah, forget it.
Who cares what I want?

18:36.701 --> 18:38.734
Well, I care,
Steve.

18:38.734 --> 18:42.501
Look, tomorrow
you gotta go out and
get some stinking job

18:42.501 --> 18:44.868
you'll be saddled with,
just to please Marcie.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.033
You really
don't want me?

18:49.467 --> 18:50.567
Oh, well.

18:50.567 --> 18:53.133
Anyway, before you do,
you owe it to yourself

18:53.133 --> 18:55.033
to do something
that pleases you.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.634
Peggy...you're right.

18:58.634 --> 19:00.067
And I'm gonna
do it.

19:01.534 --> 19:02.534
Wish me luck.

19:02.534 --> 19:03.901
Good luck.

19:05.968 --> 19:07.167
[SIGHS]

19:07.167 --> 19:08.701
He wants me.

19:14.934 --> 19:16.300
Last call.

19:25.601 --> 19:27.968
Come on, Marcie.
It's a normal bar bet.

19:27.968 --> 19:30.601
Twenty five thousand
dollars to the one
who can hit the bowl

19:30.601 --> 19:33.267
from farthest away.

19:33.267 --> 19:35.133
Shall we?

19:35.133 --> 19:37.033
I got 5 bucks
on the broad.

19:39.801 --> 19:42.000
I don't know.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.767
Maybe the smell
of this check will
wake Steve up again.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.701
Maybe it will remind him
of the good old days,

19:48.701 --> 19:50.734
when we used to drive
to the poor side of town,

19:50.734 --> 19:52.567
and pull up
next to some old guy,

19:52.567 --> 19:54.567
and ask him
for change of 1000.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.534
[LAUGHS]

19:56.534 --> 20:00.067
Oh, the times we had.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.834
I don't know.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.133
Maybe I've been
too hard on him.

20:05.133 --> 20:08.234
I'm gonna tell Steve
about the money.

20:08.234 --> 20:10.000
Hey,
look at this.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.033
<i>And to close,</i>

20:12.033 --> 20:16.334
<i>we have a story
about a true moron.</i>

20:16.334 --> 20:18.968
<i>Tonight,
an unemployed househusband</i>

20:18.968 --> 20:20.968
<i>and self-described
man of nature,</i>

20:20.968 --> 20:23.667
<i>thinking that the last
Caribbean pygmy turtle</i>

20:23.667 --> 20:25.534
<i>born in captivity
was unhappy,</i>

20:25.534 --> 20:28.501
<i>broke into the zoo aquarium,
stole the turtle</i>

20:28.501 --> 20:30.834
<i>and released it
into Lake Michigan.</i>

20:39.234 --> 20:41.901
<i>Apparently,
this man of nature</i>

20:41.901 --> 20:45.234
<i>didn't know it was
a saltwater turtle.</i>

20:45.234 --> 20:48.334
<i>Witnesses report
Bosco tried valiantly</i>

20:48.334 --> 20:50.033
<i>to crawl back
out of the water,</i>

20:50.033 --> 20:54.801
<i>only to be thrown back in
by this deranged,
unemployed man,</i>

20:54.801 --> 20:58.634
<i>standing on the bank,
singing "Born Free."</i>

21:00.000 --> 21:02.334
<i>Bosco will be missed.</i>

21:10.133 --> 21:14.167
<i>Bail has been set
at $25,000.</i>

21:14.167 --> 21:16.601
<i>Not nearly enough
in this reporter's opinion.</i>

21:18.968 --> 21:21.133
Ahh, well.

21:21.133 --> 21:24.067
I guess I know
what I have to do.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.834
You gonna go
bail him out?

21:25.834 --> 21:28.133
Let him rot.

21:28.133 --> 21:31.100
I'm gonna buy myself
a new Jag.

21:38.067 --> 21:41.501
Hey, Bundy.
You ready to
settle up your tab?

21:41.501 --> 21:42.501
Yep, I'm ready.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.467
* Born free *

21:51.467 --> 21:53.467
* Free as the grass grows *

21:55.534 --> 21:57.634
* Free as the wind blows *

22:04.834 --> 22:06.934
