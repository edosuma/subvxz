00:01.880 --> 00:05.299
Black Panther, Klaue and Madame
Masque are accounted for.

00:05.300 --> 00:07.919
That's two down, two more
Shadow Council to go.

00:07.920 --> 00:11.919
Killmonger and Tiger Shark are still
at large and still dangerous.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.379
Shuri, have you found anything?

00:14.380 --> 00:15.919
Where is Baron Zemo?

00:15.920 --> 00:17.999
I lost Zemo in the smoke.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.799
I did find this.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.629
It must have broken open
when the temple crashed.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.629
The Crown wasn't in it.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.129
Hmm?

00:26.130 --> 00:28.879
Baron Zemo, do you hear me?
What is your status?

00:28.880 --> 00:31.919
I am alive. Have you found
the containment box?

00:31.920 --> 00:33.879
We possess the box,
but it is empty.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.499
<i>The Crown must have separated
from it when we crashed.</i>

00:36.500 --> 00:38.459
<i>We are searching for it now.</i>

00:38.460 --> 00:40.709
And I believe our enemies
are searching as well.

00:40.710 --> 00:43.249
Keep at it, Zemo. We
cannot allow Killmonger

00:43.250 --> 00:45.209
to find the Crown before we do.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.209
All right. How do we do that?

00:47.210 --> 00:49.669
Everybody fan out in three
different directions.

00:49.670 --> 00:52.039
You two split up that way.
I'll go this way.

00:52.040 --> 00:55.039
So, we're just going to leave
Klaue and Madame Masque?

00:55.040 --> 00:58.839
Finding the Crown is more important
than standing guard over them.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.679
Secret Avengers, let's move out.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.840
At long last, my
victory is complete.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.946
I think not.

01:23.849 --> 01:25.249
Killmonger!

01:25.250 --> 01:27.749
Zemo! What do you
think you're doing?

01:27.750 --> 01:30.539
That Crown does not
belong to you!

01:36.590 --> 01:40.959
You play the part of hero too
well for your own good, Zemo.

01:42.421 --> 01:43.879
Killmonger to Shadow Council.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.240
I have the Crown.
Meet me at the...

01:47.670 --> 01:49.840
Give me the Crown, Killmonger.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.129
You lost.

01:55.130 --> 01:56.669
Admit it.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.749
Embrace your failure.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.539
Not while I live.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.090
You heard the man, Killmonger.

02:15.420 --> 02:18.959
Thank you, Captain America.
I will take that now.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.839
Captain America?

02:20.840 --> 02:23.590
What makes you think
I'm Captain America?

02:25.800 --> 02:28.919
Surprise. It's me,
Princess Zanda.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.669
Excited to see your old love?

02:35.460 --> 02:38.169
He doesn't look excited.

02:38.170 --> 02:39.879
He looks weak.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.299
Indeed, Tiger Shark.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.039
Victory belongs to the strong.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.880
Victory belongs to
the Shadow Council!

03:03.630 --> 03:05.799
You will never take the
Crown, Killmonger.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.632
I will not allow it!

03:07.920 --> 03:09.749
You are a fool, T'Challa.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.709
Weak and pampered,
like all the royals.

03:11.710 --> 03:16.339
With this, I will bring Wakanda to
its rightful place in the world.

03:16.340 --> 03:17.879
Your time is done.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.379
Tiger Shark, if you will.

03:20.380 --> 03:24.241
Finally. I haven't eaten
anything in hours.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.545
No! You can't do it!

03:35.300 --> 03:37.709
Cheating! That's cheating!

03:42.710 --> 03:46.379
Struggle all you like.
This is the end of you.

03:46.380 --> 03:47.755
You and your pet traitor.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.339
The Crown, Killmonger.
Right now.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.889
Never. Zemo is nothing.
T'Challa is broken.

04:03.914 --> 04:05.799
The three of us can defeat you.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.669
Maybe. But I'm betting
you can't handle this.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.710
Iron Man!

04:11.711 --> 04:13.749
Yep. Iron Man and the Avengers.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.999
You know, Earth's Mightiest
Heroes and all that.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.919
You may have heard of us.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.709
Hey, Thor, I was gonna say that.

04:27.710 --> 04:29.459
You said it last time.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.669
Let somebody else have a turn.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.839
Thor, don't lose him.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.800
Fear not, my friend. The fish
man will not escape my wrath.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.919
Unhand me, outsider. This
is none of your concern.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.709
You say that, but then you crash your
giant space temple into my backyard.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.000
We frown on that kind of thing.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.999
So, this is awkward.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.379
Well, you could
always surrender.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.630
It'll save time.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.929
All right, all right.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.930
I just need to do one
little thing first.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.479
We must stop her!

05:15.480 --> 05:17.899
You know, the Avengers
will take it from here.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.407
You've done enough.

05:21.217 --> 05:23.035
Go.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.900
Unfair. How did you
get in front of me?

05:40.730 --> 05:41.756
Huh?

05:43.850 --> 05:46.309
Uh, yeah, we're the Avengers.

05:46.310 --> 05:48.309
We're just that awesome.

05:48.310 --> 05:50.849
We told you surrendering
would save time.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.221
You think you can hold me?

05:55.640 --> 05:57.099
Ugh!

05:58.964 --> 06:01.690
Surprised? Maybe you
should wear sleeves.

06:02.715 --> 06:05.989
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I hate shape-shifters.

06:06.690 --> 06:10.400
You almost blew up New York.
Who does that?

06:13.770 --> 06:16.400
And for what? A little bling?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.849
I appreciate the
importance of accessories.

06:19.850 --> 06:23.520
But that Crown? Let's be honest.
It's a bit much.

06:27.291 --> 06:31.559
That Crown is the greatest weapon
Wakanda has ever produced.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.729
I did not know that!

06:33.730 --> 06:37.099
Hey, T'Challa, buddy, what
is the "greatest weapon

06:37.100 --> 06:40.309
Wakanda has ever produced"
doing in New Jersey?

06:47.690 --> 06:50.729
So, the Avengers just barged
into our battle and took over?

06:50.730 --> 06:52.479
Who do they think they are?

06:52.480 --> 06:54.575
Uh, the Avengers?

06:55.009 --> 06:56.019
Fair.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.639
The Avengers can keep the
Shadow Council occupied.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.979
We must secure the Crown.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.350
Nothing is more
important than that.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.599
Hey!

07:05.600 --> 07:06.750
Find the Crown.

07:06.751 --> 07:07.899
Shuri!

07:07.900 --> 07:10.099
I won't let them escape.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.099
You sure she's okay on her own?

07:12.100 --> 07:15.600
Madame Masque and Klaue will
not know what hit them.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.599
Sorry, Klaue. You're
just not fast enough.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.409
I don't need fast
when I've got this.

07:45.370 --> 07:47.349
Two birds, one stone.

07:50.242 --> 07:51.349
What is this?

07:51.350 --> 07:54.269
Ceramic tangle web. I
designed it myself.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.769
What do you think?

07:55.770 --> 07:57.769
We don't have time
for silly games!

07:57.770 --> 08:00.599
We've all got to get
out of here, now!

08:00.600 --> 08:03.639
"We"? I think it's time you
and I had a little chat.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.729
Tired already, fish man?

08:19.730 --> 08:23.139
I thought Atlanteans
were meant to be tough!

08:23.140 --> 08:25.139
Having fun over there, Thor?

08:25.140 --> 08:28.139
It has been some time since
I had a real workout.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.599
Ha-ha!

08:29.600 --> 08:32.154
There's the little fish!

08:32.155 --> 08:33.599
Huh?

08:33.600 --> 08:37.520
Okay, then. Anyone got
eyes on Killmonger?

08:39.140 --> 08:41.558
Where are you, you
blasted thing?

08:41.559 --> 08:44.559
I haven't come this far
only to lose you in...

08:44.560 --> 08:47.606
There! Finally,

08:47.607 --> 08:49.479
- I can...
- Ironic, is it not?

08:49.480 --> 08:51.899
You hid yourself from
us for all those years,

08:51.900 --> 08:55.399
but here, now, I see
your true face.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.309
And I see you, my King.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.269
The Crown! At last!

09:21.670 --> 09:24.763
Zemo, hurry! Secure the Crown!

09:27.610 --> 09:29.900
You have your crown,
King T'Challa.

09:31.490 --> 09:35.279
This one belongs to...
Baron Zemo.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.489
No, Zemo!

09:36.490 --> 09:38.400
Don't put it on!

09:55.900 --> 09:59.819
Yes! Finally I have the power
that is my birthright!

09:59.820 --> 10:02.819
Finally, Zemo will rule!

10:02.820 --> 10:06.569
Zemo, take off the Crown.
This was not the plan.

10:06.570 --> 10:09.029
Take it off?

10:09.030 --> 10:11.358
Why would I ever take it off?

10:13.940 --> 10:16.939
Don't be a fool. Remove the
Crown before it's too late.

10:16.940 --> 10:20.325
It's already too
late for all of you.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.989
Years of planning,

10:25.990 --> 10:28.239
playing the Shadow Council
against Wakanda...

10:28.240 --> 10:32.489
all to gain your confidence,
to learn your secrets.

10:32.490 --> 10:34.859
Captain America was right.

10:34.860 --> 10:37.820
You never should
have trusted me.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.461
None of you.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.894
I was wrong. Zemo fooled me.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.562
For the record,
Zemo fooled us all.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.899
Now he's got super strength,
energy blasts, and flight.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.770
We need a plan, T'Challa.

10:55.527 --> 10:59.019
Our first priority must be to
separate him from the Crown.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.599
- I think we...
- Secret Wakandan weapons?

11:01.600 --> 11:03.339
Villains coming out
of the woodwork?

11:03.340 --> 11:06.550
At what point are you gonna come clean
and tell us what this is all about?

11:06.850 --> 11:11.019
Tony, he can't do that. But please
believe me that he has a good reason.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.587
I trust Black Panther
with my life.

11:13.980 --> 11:15.980
That makes one of us.

11:19.060 --> 11:21.059
Zemo's headed for Manhattan.

11:21.060 --> 11:23.439
Secret or not, we're
all Avengers today.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.559
And that means...
Avengers Assemble!

11:28.850 --> 11:30.639
So much power.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.849
It is as if it's speaking to me,

11:32.850 --> 11:34.357
telling me...

11:35.191 --> 11:36.979
Yes, telling me...

11:36.980 --> 11:40.979
There! There is where
I build my kingdom.

11:40.980 --> 11:44.325
Taking advice from a hat?
Interesting choice.

11:44.850 --> 11:46.620
Go away, Stark.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.139
Your pathetic repulsors
are nothing to me now.

11:53.892 --> 11:55.349
Perhaps not,

11:55.350 --> 11:57.810
but they make a
fine distraction!

12:03.094 --> 12:06.599
Incredible! My power
is still growing!

12:06.600 --> 12:10.019
Already an Asgardian
is no match for me.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.229
Soon I will...

12:12.230 --> 12:13.230
I will...

12:14.230 --> 12:16.849
No! No, no, no, no!
What is this?

12:18.640 --> 12:21.439
Aahh! No!

12:21.440 --> 12:24.970
It hurts! It's not
supposed to hurt! Aah!

12:25.030 --> 12:28.280
See? This is what happens when you
mess with other people's toys.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.769
If I had a nickel for every...

12:29.770 --> 12:31.189
Aah!

12:31.190 --> 12:32.940
Aah!

12:36.569 --> 12:38.269
Natasha, Clint, you're up!

12:38.270 --> 12:41.189
Thor's out, my systems
are shutting down,

12:41.190 --> 12:44.520
and something is really wrong
with Zemo and that Crown.

12:46.980 --> 12:50.020
Got it. We're at the bridge right...
Whoa!

12:51.690 --> 12:53.514
Natasha!

13:03.730 --> 13:06.479
Away! All of you! Get away!

13:06.480 --> 13:08.769
I cannot stand all
of your gibbering!

13:08.770 --> 13:09.770
I...

13:24.140 --> 13:27.849
A second energy wave. Far more
powerful than the first. And yet...

13:27.850 --> 13:30.809
We're still standing. How
are we still standing?

13:30.810 --> 13:34.189
It seems your shield and my armor
have something in common, Captain.

13:34.190 --> 13:36.849
Shuri, where are you, sister?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.849
<i>Here. In the temple.</i>

13:38.850 --> 13:40.639
<i>What's left of it, anyway.</i>

13:40.640 --> 13:42.639
I've been talking with Klaue.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.019
He wants to tell you what
Killmonger told him.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.309
Ah, it's not important.

13:47.310 --> 13:50.099
Just rumors, really. Nothing
to worry your heads abou...

13:53.100 --> 13:55.480
Yes! Right!

13:58.060 --> 14:00.599
Killmonger discovered
an old tale...

14:00.600 --> 14:02.599
just a whisper, really...

14:02.600 --> 14:05.809
about some miracle of ancient
Wakandan technology.

14:05.810 --> 14:07.689
The Crown.

14:07.690 --> 14:11.059
Why do you think Killmonger had
me digging around in those caves?

14:11.060 --> 14:14.189
Buried down there with
those blasted bats

14:14.190 --> 14:16.559
was the lost legend
of that Crown,

14:16.560 --> 14:18.479
all hidden away.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.559
Everyone forgot. But I found it.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.479
I know something about
Wakanda that you don't.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.939
You don't know half
as much as you think.

14:27.940 --> 14:30.439
What I do know, little Princess,

14:30.440 --> 14:33.349
is that if you put on that
Crown inside Wakanda,

14:33.350 --> 14:35.349
there's nothing
that can stop you.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.349
But outside Wakanda...

14:37.621 --> 14:39.849
Outside Wakanda,

14:39.850 --> 14:42.349
the Crown becomes unstable.

14:42.350 --> 14:44.729
Yeah. Yeah. Outside Wakanda,

14:44.730 --> 14:47.899
you put the Crown on, you and
everything around you goes boom.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.810
Which is why we have to
get far away from here.

14:51.770 --> 14:53.269
Or...

14:53.270 --> 14:55.980
Yes. I see your point.

14:57.310 --> 15:00.599
We could also stay
a little longer.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.857
This makes no sense.

15:01.882 --> 15:05.225
Why would the Crown only be
safe to use within Wakanda?

15:05.226 --> 15:07.309
What does Wakanda have except...

15:07.310 --> 15:09.099
Vibranium! Of course.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.769
The Shrouded Temple was
laced with pure Vibranium,

15:11.770 --> 15:13.826
as was the Crown's
containment box.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.813
No. No, it doesn't track. What
about you and Killmonger?

15:17.814 --> 15:19.899
My armor contains Vibranium.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.939
Killmonger's is
an exact replica.

15:21.940 --> 15:24.639
We both held the Crown
and came to no harm.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.965
Steve, it fits.

15:26.990 --> 15:30.569
So, contact with normal Vibranium
will neutralize the Crown's energy?

15:30.570 --> 15:35.149
If that's correct, the only question
is, how much Vibranium does it take?

15:37.990 --> 15:40.529
Stay away! It hurts!

15:41.338 --> 15:43.399
Make it stop!

15:43.400 --> 15:45.692
That's right, folks. Less panic,

15:45.717 --> 15:46.899
more running.

15:48.310 --> 15:50.089
Natasha, go! We're
running out of...

15:56.185 --> 15:59.029
So, he's getting worse, right?

15:59.030 --> 16:00.529
That was worse?

16:05.530 --> 16:07.089
Definitely getting worse.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.779
How does that help?

16:16.780 --> 16:19.350
It gives us five more seconds.
Everybody go!

16:19.351 --> 16:20.601
Off the bridge! Go!

16:21.610 --> 16:23.699
Now, you idiots! Move!

16:26.490 --> 16:29.359
Whoa! "Idiots"?
Kind of harsh, Nat.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.819
Sorry. I'm having a day.

16:33.143 --> 16:37.359
Help me! It won't come off!
You must help me.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.860
You have to... Help me!

16:45.436 --> 16:46.789
You're a fool, Zemo.

16:46.990 --> 16:49.989
No one can wield the
Crown outside Wakanda.

16:51.031 --> 16:54.779
Killmonger, you
know what this is.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.199
You can stop it.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.989
I do. I can.

16:58.990 --> 17:01.069
Then do it!

17:01.070 --> 17:05.182
We are allies. We reformed
the Shadow Council together.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.839
We were allies.

17:07.839 --> 17:11.299
You chose betrayal. Now
you pay the price.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.388
The Crown's next pulse
will be your last, Baron.

17:14.390 --> 17:16.929
In just a few seconds,
I should say.

17:17.726 --> 17:21.509
Long enough to deal with you!

17:21.510 --> 17:24.679
Aah! Aah!

17:52.840 --> 17:55.049
Did it! T'Challa, we did it!

17:55.050 --> 17:57.049
Zemo's down, but the Crown...

17:57.050 --> 17:59.140
T'Challa, the Crown's
still active!

18:05.720 --> 18:07.759
T'Challa, wait. What about Zemo?

18:07.760 --> 18:12.126
He is not important now. The Crown is
building to another explosive pulse!

18:31.430 --> 18:34.009
This fiasco is your
fault, Killmonger.

18:34.010 --> 18:37.062
Had you not attacked
the temple, we... Huh?

18:39.220 --> 18:42.639
There's no "we," Zemo.

18:42.640 --> 18:47.429
The plan was always for me to
wield the Crown within Wakanda.

18:47.430 --> 18:51.219
You've ruined all our plans
for your selfish ends.

18:51.220 --> 18:54.549
Because you're weak,
just like T'Challa.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.599
The Shadow Council
is the future.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.599
But you, Baron Zemo?

18:58.600 --> 19:01.719
You're history.

19:18.151 --> 19:19.759
Where are we going?

19:19.760 --> 19:21.260
The embassy.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.760
Hop on. I'm faster.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.469
Aah!

19:29.470 --> 19:32.549
The pulses are getting worse.

19:32.550 --> 19:35.760
And closer together. We
are running out of time.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.929
T'Challa!

19:47.300 --> 19:50.389
You okay? That thing's burning
out the Vibranium in your armor.

19:51.671 --> 19:54.219
It will hold long enough to
get us to the sublevels.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.019
That is all that matters.

19:57.568 --> 20:00.799
The gyroforge not only houses our
Vibranium, it is made of it.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.430
If I can seal the Crown inside, it
should absorb its explosive energy.

20:08.243 --> 20:11.549
Avengers, everyone get to
the Wakandan Embassy now!

20:11.550 --> 20:12.889
Black Panther is...

20:24.800 --> 20:26.099
What's happening?

20:29.384 --> 20:33.266
The gyroforge's Vibranium cannot
contain the Crown's energies.

20:33.267 --> 20:35.890
The next pulse will lay
waste to the city!

20:36.510 --> 20:38.526
Then we have to contain it!

20:39.720 --> 20:41.549
Steve, no!

20:45.825 --> 20:48.259
I'm sorry, T'Challa!
I can't hold it!

20:48.260 --> 20:51.049
The Crown's energy is
going to tear you apart!

20:51.250 --> 20:54.539
T'Challa, get out!
It's the only way!

20:54.540 --> 20:57.589
Aah! No! I won't leave you!

20:57.590 --> 20:59.421
Steve!

21:08.466 --> 21:10.259
Captain America!

21:10.749 --> 21:12.539
Steve?

21:12.540 --> 21:14.105
What happened here?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.669
And where's Cap?

21:15.670 --> 21:19.709
I saw it. I saw what happened.

21:19.710 --> 21:22.709
Black Panther killed
Captain America!

21:22.710 --> 21:23.919
No!

21:23.920 --> 21:27.539
T'Challa... what have you done?
