01:30.257 --> 01:32.259
<i>There's no in between.</i>

01:33.885 --> 01:35.887
<i>And if I'm guilty...</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:43.020
it means that I am
the ultimate figure to fear.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.732
Because I'm not the obvious one.

01:46.815 --> 01:50.360
But on the other hand,
if I'm innocent,

01:50.443 --> 01:53.488
it means that everyone's vulnerable.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.323
And that's everyone's nightmare.

01:56.449 --> 02:00.746
Either I'm a psychopath

02:00.829 --> 02:03.123

02:19.014 --> 02:22.476
You can see that this
does not look like grief,

02:22.559 --> 02:24.352
does not read as grief.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.731
I think everyone's reaction
to something horrible is different.

02:31.609 --> 02:36.489
Your roommates, your boyfriend, the cops,
they all say the same thing.

-No.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.817
-It was one and a half, okay?
-[woman] It was one shot.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.029
One and a half.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.032
[Amanda] <i>I didn't depend on myself much.</i>

06:06.741 --> 06:10.453
<i>And I felt like it was very important</i>
<i>for me to get out of my comfort zone</i>

06:10.537 --> 06:13.206
and see if that made me
turn into an adult.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.254

06:29.847 --> 06:31.849
Fuckin' yeah, bitch.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.489
Those first weeks,
I was discovering what the city was.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.248
<i>I was living with these Italian women</i>

06:55.332 --> 06:59.836
<i>and a British girl my age,</i>
<i>who was super sophisticated.</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:05.592
<i>And we had this beautiful house</i>
<i>that overlooked this valley, like,</i>

07:05.675 --> 07:07.761
I was owning it. [chuckles]

07:14.142 --> 07:18.063
<i>I was expecting that I was going to be</i>

07:20.482 --> 07:23.026
<i>And it was zero work.</i>

07:25.695 --> 07:28.115
<i>And so I thought,</i>
<i>"Okay, I might as well get a job."</i>

07:30.533 --> 07:35.580
<i>Patrick Lumumba was</i>

I swear to God,

07:43.130 --> 07:44.672
I don't know what it is about people

08:10.115 --> 08:11.866
She was very, very pretty.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.703
[stutters] When I looked at her,
she looked at me back.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.748
I was so shy
that even if she looked at me,

08:18.831 --> 08:20.000
she smiled at me,

08:20.083 --> 08:21.793
I was turning back and said,

08:21.876 --> 08:24.921
"Is she looking at somebody in my back?"
[chuckles]

08:25.005 --> 08:26.589
It was not. It was me.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.885
So after I realized it, I said,
"Why not talking?"

08:30.968 --> 08:35.432
He immediately recognized from my accent
that I was American or spoke English

08:35.515 --> 08:38.518
and so he started speaking
to me in English, because he can.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.602
Um, or at least, kinda.

08:48.611 --> 08:52.240
[Raffaele] <i>I showed her a beautiful</i>
<i>panorama of Perugia,</i>

08:52.324 --> 08:54.867

08:54.951 --> 08:57.370
I had my heart beating so fast, like...

08:57.454 --> 09:01.208
You know, like,
"Oh, there's the romance now." [chuckles]

09:01.291 --> 09:03.626
And... I kissed her.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.758

"Hey, baby."

09:10.842 --> 09:14.596
Like, he was super nice
and I was completely charmed.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.598
And... yeah.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.975
Well, we went to home.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.477
I started to smoke,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.230
to try to prepare a joint
or something like that,

09:23.313 --> 09:27.900
but then we thought about
something different.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.965
and going to the outdoor market.

09:51.048 --> 09:57.222

because all Italian ladies have perfumes.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.612
it's just a fantastic buzz.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.197
I mean, I'd like to say it's like
having sex or something like that.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.323
[chuckles] You know?

17:54.406 --> 17:56.075
[bell tolling]

18:28.065 --> 18:31.402
[Amanda] <i>Meredith was my friend</i>
<i>of a few weeks.</i>

18:33.029 --> 18:35.447
<i>We weren't lifetime best friends.</i>

18:38.534 --> 18:44.040
<i>But I was so shocked</i>
<i>by what happened to her.</i>

18:46.417 --> 18:48.085
<i>It made no sense.</i>

18:50.296 --> 18:52.131
<i>It was brutal.</i>

18:53.883 --> 18:55.885
<i>And it could've happened to me.</i>

19:00.264 --> 19:03.768
<i>But I was at Raffaele's apartment</i>
<i>the night of the murder.</i>

19:07.521 --> 19:11.233
We watched <i>Amélie,</i>
and in the middle of watching <i>Amélie,</i>

19:11.317 --> 19:15.487
I got a text message from Patrick saying
that I didn't have to come into work,

19:15.571 --> 19:17.031
and I was like, "Yes!"

19:17.114 --> 19:20.451
We finished watching the movie.
We made dinner.

19:20.534 --> 19:24.538
And I read to him
from a German Harry Potter book.

19:24.621 --> 19:29.626
And after that we just hung out
on his bed and talked

19:29.711 --> 19:32.672
and made goofy faces at each other.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.675
And eventually that turned into kissing

19:35.758 --> 19:39.887
which turned into the making love
and then passing out.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.189
<i>The next morning, I wake up,</i>

19:50.272 --> 19:53.025
<i>I told him that I was gonna</i>
<i>go back to my place.</i>

19:53.109 --> 19:56.278
So I went there. [sighs]
Um, I just walked down.

19:56.362 --> 20:01.784
And the first thing that I saw was
that my front door was already open.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.292
<i>The common area was normal.</i>

20:10.376 --> 20:14.922
<i>My room was normal,</i>
<i>normal messy, but normal.</i>

20:15.006 --> 20:19.010
<i>And I got undressed</i>
<i>and I walked into the bathroom.</i>

20:19.093 --> 20:24.056
And I noticed that there was
some drops of blood in the sink.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.479
But... I mean, there were just
a few drops of blood.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.314
Whatever. Um...

20:32.398 --> 20:33.983
I brushed my teeth.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.319
And then I took a shower.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.197
When I stepped out of the shower
onto the bath mat,

20:40.281 --> 20:44.326
that's when I noticed the larger
splotch of blood on the bath mat.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.002
<i>But there's only some spots of blood</i>
<i>and then that,</i>

20:53.085 --> 20:56.463
<i>so maybe someone cut themselves,</i>
<i>something like that.</i>

20:57.089 --> 21:00.051
<i>It was right after I was done</i>
<i>blow-drying my hair</i>

21:00.134 --> 21:03.763
<i>that I just happened</i>
<i>to look over into the toilet</i>

21:03.846 --> 21:06.557
<i>and saw that feces had been left there.</i>

21:08.225 --> 21:10.978
That gave me the creeps.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.980
Like, all of a sudden
I got this creepy feeling

21:13.064 --> 21:15.149
like someone was in the house with me.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.068
And I was just like, "Oh, shit."

21:17.151 --> 21:22.239
So, I went to Raffaele
and I talked to him about it.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.533
[Raffaele] <i>I went back there.</i>

21:25.868 --> 21:28.037
<i>I saw all this mess.</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:29.580
<i>It was very weird.</i>

21:30.289 --> 21:36.963
And I was a little bit surprised
that she took a shower inside her house

21:37.046 --> 21:40.716
without having the anxiety of it.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.885
We tried Meredith's room

21:42.969 --> 21:46.222
and the door was locked,
which was very strange.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.100
And so I knocked gently
and called for Meredith.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.602
And then I knocked louder
and I called for Meredith.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.812
And finally I was like,

21:52.895 --> 21:55.731
"Raffaele, can you please, like,
try to break open this door?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.774
I don't know if Meredith's
in there or not."

21:57.859 --> 22:02.071
And he tried kicking it down twice,
but it didn't work.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.741
[phone chimes]

22:05.825 --> 22:08.577
[Raffaele in Italian]
<i>Hello, good morning, listen...</i>

22:08.660 --> 22:12.664
<i>someone made a mess</i>
<i>and there is a door closed.</i>

22:12.748 --> 22:15.292
<i>And there are also blood marks</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

22:15.376 --> 22:17.794
[dispatcher] <i>Which door is closed?</i>

22:17.879 --> 22:21.090
[Raffaele] <i>One of the roommates.</i>
<i>We don't know where she is.</i>

22:21.173 --> 22:24.886
[dispatcher] <i>I am sending a police car</i>
<i>so that we can inspect the situation.</i>

22:26.387 --> 22:29.056
[Amanda in English] <i>The police, like,</i>
<i>kicked us all out of the house.</i>

22:29.140 --> 22:31.058
<i>Kicked down Meredith's door.</i>

22:31.142 --> 22:32.684
And they were saying that her...

22:32.768 --> 22:36.397
Like, there was blood everywhere
and that her throat had been slit and...

22:38.190 --> 22:43.154
And so that's how I was told
that Meredith was dead.

23:03.382 --> 23:09.471
[Giuliano in Italian] <i>I have always had</i>
<i>a great passion for investigating.</i>

23:10.764 --> 23:13.100
<i>I like detective movies a lot.</i>

23:14.601 --> 23:16.478
Sherlock Holmes, <i>for example.</i>

23:17.646 --> 23:23.444
<i>He was able to get clues</i>
<i>from seemingly insignificant events.</i>

23:26.530 --> 23:28.782
<i>Why was the girl covered with the blanket?</i>

23:30.784 --> 23:34.913
A woman who has killed

23:34.997 --> 23:38.709
tends to cover the body of female victims.

23:38.792 --> 23:43.047
A man would never think to do this.

23:46.175 --> 23:50.679
<i>The thing that struck me the most</i>
<i>was the break-in.</i>

23:52.556 --> 23:54.641
<i>Nothing had been stolen.</i>

23:55.226 --> 24:00.439
<i>And there was no evidence</i>
<i>that someone had climbed the wall.</i>

24:02.566 --> 24:09.365
<i>Immediately, I could tell</i>
<i>it was a staged break-in.</i>

24:10.741 --> 24:16.413
It could have no other function than this,

24:16.497 --> 24:20.126
throw off suspicion from someone

24:20.209 --> 24:27.133
who has a connection to the house.

24:35.766 --> 24:39.645
[Amanda in English] <i>The next day,</i>
<i>they brought me back to my place.</i>

24:40.646 --> 24:42.856
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>I was back in my apartment</i>

24:42.939 --> 24:45.359
<i>after it had been closed off</i>
<i>as a crime scene.</i>

24:51.948 --> 24:55.286
<i>And they were having me</i>
<i>go through the knife drawer</i>

24:55.369 --> 24:57.954
<i>to see if any of the knives were missing.</i>

24:58.039 --> 24:59.873
<i>So basically they were asking me to see</i>

24:59.956 --> 25:04.086
if there was the murder weapon
missing from this drawer.

25:04.170 --> 25:08.965
And it just all hit me all at once,
and I became hysterical.

25:09.050 --> 25:15.389
[in Italian] She started hitting
the palms of her hands on her ears.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.226
<i>As if there was the memory</i>

25:19.310 --> 25:23.480
<i>of a noise, a sound, a scream.</i>

25:23.564 --> 25:26.358
<i>Meredith's scream.</i>

25:26.442 --> 25:31.322
Undoubtedly, I started

25:31.405 --> 25:35.159
to suspect Amanda.

25:48.839 --> 25:49.840
[Amanda] <i>Pronto.</i>

25:49.923 --> 25:53.094
[Brett in English] <i>Amanda, it's Brett.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

25:53.177 --> 25:57.598
[Amanda] <i>I'm just about to head home</i>
<i>from one of Raffaele's friend's places.</i>

25:57.681 --> 26:01.393
[Brett] <i>So, is Raffaele, like,</i>
<i>your, like, boyfriend?</i>

26:01.477 --> 26:03.270
[Amanda] <i>Yeah.</i>

26:03.354 --> 26:05.189
[Brett] <i>He's super hot?</i>

26:05.272 --> 26:07.524
[Amanda] <i>I'll send you a picture.</i>

26:07.608 --> 26:10.111
[Brett] <i>Do it now. Do it now.</i>

26:10.194 --> 26:12.863
<i>Amanda, I miss you so much.</i>

26:12.946 --> 26:14.115
[Amanda] <i>Yeah, I know...</i>

26:14.198 --> 26:16.867
<i>I had a really bad day today.</i>
<i>Fuck, man.</i>

26:16.950 --> 26:19.411
<i>Like, being in the police station,</i>
<i>I'm incredibly nervous,</i>

26:19.495 --> 26:21.997
<i>and I always feel like</i>
<i>I'm about to burst into crying,</i>

26:22.080 --> 26:24.250
<i>'cause I'm just, like, so upset,</i>
<i>but, um...</i>

26:24.333 --> 26:26.293
<i>Like, I feel good now talking to you.</i>

26:26.377 --> 26:28.587
[Brett] <i>Oh, honey...</i>

26:28.670 --> 26:30.046
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

26:30.131 --> 26:33.634
<i>Remember, when that happens, go, "Wait.</i>

26:33.717 --> 26:38.472
<i>I'm in Italy and I'm with Raffaele.</i>

26:38.555 --> 26:42.393
<i>And I'm 20, and I'm gonna</i>
<i>look back on this year as, like,</i>

26:42.476 --> 26:45.103
<i>the best year of my life."</i>

26:50.276 --> 26:52.611
[Giuliano in Italian]
<i>The night of the 5th,</i>

26:52.694 --> 26:55.364
<i>we had a breakthrough</i>
<i>in the investigation.</i>

26:57.908 --> 27:00.619
Sollecito is called
into the police station.

27:00.702 --> 27:05.416
Amanda was not called in,
but she follows him anyway.

27:05.499 --> 27:09.586
She was waiting
in the corridor of the police station,

27:09.670 --> 27:12.756
and they were starting to be
very rude to me

27:12.839 --> 27:16.385
and asking me questions about, um...

27:16.468 --> 27:18.345
"What happened that night?"

27:18.429 --> 27:21.557
That night,
I know that I was in my apartment.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.602
I know that I spent the night with Amanda.
I know she slept with me.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.438
But they were not satisfied.

27:27.521 --> 27:33.402
And they were pushing, and aggressive,
and they became the worst of the worst.

27:35.696 --> 27:39.741
<i>This policeman told me</i>
<i>that Amanda lied all the time,</i>

27:39.825 --> 27:44.413
<i>she was a stupid slut, a cow,</i>
<i>that didn't care about me.</i>

27:44.496 --> 27:47.208
"Your situation is very, very bad."

27:49.501 --> 27:51.878
<i>After a long time...</i>

27:52.421 --> 27:54.756
the reality around you

27:54.840 --> 27:58.760
turns to twist and don't be so clear.

27:59.928 --> 28:04.683
[Giuliano in Italian] <i>Then Sollecito</i>
<i>changes his version of the events.</i>

28:04.766 --> 28:07.394
<i>He turned his back on Amanda.</i>

28:07.478 --> 28:11.773
<i>He says,</i>
<i>"So far I've told a bunch of lies,</i>

28:11.857 --> 28:14.485
<i>because she told me to say them.</i>

28:14.568 --> 28:17.779
The truth is I was home that night.

28:17.863 --> 28:22.158
Amanda wasn't with me
and didn't come back until 1:00 a.m."

28:30.917 --> 28:33.128
<i>Let's put ourselves in Amanda's shoes.</i>

28:33.211 --> 28:38.550
<i>You go to the police station</i>
<i>with your boyfriend.</i>

28:38.634 --> 28:43.054
<i>You are in a different room</i>
<i>and don't know what he's saying.</i>

28:43.138 --> 28:45.932
<i>Then at a certain point</i>
<i>they come to tell you,</i>

28:46.016 --> 28:50.437
<i>"Your boyfriend... he's turned on you."</i>

28:52.898 --> 28:54.858
[chiming]

28:56.402 --> 28:58.445
[Amanda in English] <i>They wanted to prove</i>
<i>that I had left.</i>

28:58.529 --> 29:00.030
<i>And they wanted my cell phone.</i>

29:00.113 --> 29:02.157
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Yes, just look at my cell phone.</i>

29:02.241 --> 29:04.910
<i>Like, I did not leave.</i>
<i>I didn't have to work that night.</i>

29:04.993 --> 29:07.246
<i>I was supposed to work,</i>
<i>but I didn't go to work.</i>

29:07.329 --> 29:09.331
<i>I didn't leave."</i>

29:09.415 --> 29:13.502
<i>They fiddled through it</i>
<i>and pulled up this text message</i>

29:13.585 --> 29:16.087
<i>that I had sent to Patrick, which said...</i>

29:16.171 --> 29:17.506
[speaking Italian]

29:19.508 --> 29:21.260
<i>Which, literally, word-for-word is,</i>

29:21.343 --> 29:26.640
<i>"We will see each other later.</i>
<i>Have a good night."</i>

29:26.723 --> 29:27.808
<i>I told them, like,</i>

29:27.891 --> 29:30.269
he sent me this text message saying,
"Don't come in to work."

29:30.352 --> 29:33.314
And so I said, "Okay, see you later then.
Have a good night."

29:33.397 --> 29:35.982
And they said,
"No, what this literally means

29:36.066 --> 29:37.526
is you are going to see someone.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.195
You made an appointment with someone,
and you don't remember.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.365
<i>Clearly, your mind is fucked.</i>

29:43.449 --> 29:45.659
<i>And you're going to be either on our side,</i>

29:45.742 --> 29:47.911
or you're gonna be on the murderer's side.

29:47.994 --> 29:49.705
And what side are you on?"

29:51.039 --> 29:54.793
<i>I got so frazzled by it, I said,</i>
<i>"I don't know what the fuck is going on."</i>

29:54.876 --> 29:59.214
<i>And another of the guys was like,</i>
<i>"'Fuck!' I understand 'fuck.' Fuck you!"</i>

29:59.298 --> 30:01.800
<i>And he thought that I was yelling</i>
<i>"Fuck you" at him.</i>

30:01.883 --> 30:04.135
<i>And I was crying,</i>

30:04.219 --> 30:06.137
<i>and, um, at a certain point,</i>

30:06.221 --> 30:08.640
<i>a police officer slapped me</i>
<i>behind the head,</i>

30:08.724 --> 30:10.100
<i>and was like, "Remember!"</i>

<i>And then he slapped me again</i>
<i>and said, "Remember,"</i>

30:12.478 --> 30:14.980
<i>like, "Get your brain straight."</i>

30:15.063 --> 30:16.440
And I broke.

30:21.570 --> 30:25.198
<i>What started popping in my mind</i>

30:25.281 --> 30:30.412
<i>was the street</i>
<i>in front of Raffaele's apartment...</i>

30:32.956 --> 30:35.417

30:38.337 --> 30:41.507
<i>Patrick in his brown leather jacket...</i>

30:42.132 --> 30:45.969
<i>and Meredith screaming.</i>

30:48.138 --> 30:49.222
<i>And I thought that meant</i>

30:49.305 --> 30:53.769
<i>that I was remembering</i>
<i>that he had killed her.</i>

30:58.189 --> 31:00.233
[siren blaring]

31:00.316 --> 31:03.404
[Giuliano in Italian] <i>I was shocked.</i>

31:03.487 --> 31:09.576
<i>Because what she said made her</i>
<i>at least an accomplice to the murder.</i>

31:10.827 --> 31:14.330
<i>And Sollecito, why did he lie?</i>

31:15.582 --> 31:19.670
<i>And so I decided to have</i>
<i>all three of them arrested.</i>

31:21.505 --> 31:22.673
[camera shutters clicking rapidly]

31:35.936 --> 31:37.563
[indistinct chatter]

31:43.234 --> 31:47.989
[man in Italian] We feel very sad
for the girl that died,

31:48.073 --> 31:51.910
yet there is also great satisfaction
for the Perugian police

31:51.993 --> 31:57.082
for having found the answers
in such a short time.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.752
The press put pressure on us,

32:00.836 --> 32:03.922
and as a result we felt the responsibility

32:04.005 --> 32:08.009
for a city that wanted
a definitive answer right away.

32:08.719 --> 32:11.847
I can't thank everybody enough

32:11.930 --> 32:16.560
in this entire investigation

32:16.643 --> 32:21.690
for their professionalism
as well as their moral commitment.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.447
[Nick in English] "Caso chiuso."
<i>Case closed.</i>

32:28.530 --> 32:31.032
You'd have thought they'd busted
some sort of mafioso godfather,

32:31.116 --> 32:32.117
the way they were reacting.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.619
[sirens blaring]

32:37.623 --> 32:40.208
<i>The lawyers are the key ones.</i>

32:40.291 --> 32:42.085
<i>I would get alongside one of the lawyers.</i>

32:42.168 --> 32:44.838
<i>He would hand me over the statements.</i>

32:44.921 --> 32:50.135
I think the photocopying places in Perugia

32:55.431 --> 32:58.560
<i>how Amanda had been behaving</i>
<i>in the waiting room.</i>

32:58.644 --> 33:00.228
<i>One of the friends said to Amanda,</i>

33:00.311 --> 33:02.939
<i>"Well, I hope</i>
<i>Meredith didn't suffer badly."</i>

33:03.023 --> 33:04.024
<i>Amanda said,</i>

33:04.107 --> 33:07.653
"Of course she fucking suffered,
she had her throat fucking cut."

33:09.404 --> 33:11.698
<i>This police officer,</i>
<i>in this disclosure, said,</i>

33:11.782 --> 33:14.367
<i>"Amanda and Raffaele</i>
<i>were kissing each other.</i>

33:14.450 --> 33:18.329
She was performing cartwheels
and doing stretching exercises."

33:19.956 --> 33:23.168
"'Course she did it. She's mad.
She's a complete and utter loon.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.545
I mean, who behaves like that?"

33:41.144 --> 33:42.478
[Edda Mellas] No comment, please.

33:42.563 --> 33:45.607
Are you still convinced
about Amanda's innocence?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.275
No comment.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.403
[Amanda] <i>The guards came to my door</i>
<i>and said, "You have visitors."</i>

33:51.697 --> 33:54.199
<i>They put me in this special little office.</i>

33:54.282 --> 33:59.454
And there was my mom.
And she was crying.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.624
And she reached out for me and...

34:07.337 --> 34:08.922
[Amanda] <i>Mom!</i>

34:10.380 --> 34:13.092
[Amanda] <i>It's okay.</i>
[Edda] <i>I know, it's scary. Are you okay?</i>

34:13.176 --> 34:15.219
[Amanda] <i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>
[Edda] <i>Okay.</i>

34:16.597 --> 34:17.931
[Amanda sobbing]

34:18.014 --> 34:21.516
[Edda] <i>Amanda, sit down.</i>
<i>Bring a chair over here.</i>

34:21.601 --> 34:25.731
[Amanda sighs] <i>I knew that I had fucked up,</i>
<i>and I felt like I had fucked up,</i>

34:25.813 --> 34:28.108
<i>and that I didn't know what to do.</i>

34:29.900 --> 34:32.946
I felt like a child again.

34:33.029 --> 34:36.992
And I knew... I was a kid.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.328
What was I pretending?

34:43.456 --> 34:45.541
I needed my mom.

34:45.626 --> 34:46.918
And...

34:49.129 --> 34:50.672
[sighing heavily]

34:50.755 --> 34:52.297
[Edda] <i>You know,</i>
<i>the lawyers were saying...</i>

34:53.174 --> 34:56.219
<i>no matter what,</i>
<i>if you had gone in and done the deed,</i>

34:56.302 --> 34:58.346
<i>they just needed to know, for sure,</i>
<i>the truth.</i>

34:58.429 --> 35:00.724
<i>-So that they could--</i>
-[Amanda] <i>Yeah, and I'm telling you--</i>

35:00.807 --> 35:02.392
[Edda] <i>So you have no idea who murdered--</i>

35:02.475 --> 35:04.603
[Amanda] <i>I have no clue. No clue.</i>

35:04.686 --> 35:07.105
<i>Because I was with Raffaele</i>
<i>at his house.</i>

35:07.188 --> 35:11.526
<i>The one thing that's really bugging me</i>
<i>is why Raffaele lied.</i>

35:11.610 --> 35:14.029
[Edda] <i>Well, hopefully,</i>
<i>he's in the same position you are,</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:15.196
<i>that he was being stressed.</i>

35:15.280 --> 35:16.615
[Amanda] <i>Yeah, I feel like</i>

35:16.698 --> 35:18.784
<i>they were smacking him around</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

35:18.867 --> 35:21.036
[Edda] <i>The lawyers said</i>
<i>something interesting.</i>

35:21.119 --> 35:25.123
<i>They said, "Amanda's been caught up</i>
<i>in something that's way bigger than her."</i>

35:25.206 --> 35:29.294
<i>Because this has turned into</i>
<i>this huge international bullshit story.</i>

35:29.377 --> 35:30.586
[Amanda] <i>Are you serious?</i>
[Edda] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

35:30.671 --> 35:33.715
<i>Everybody in the family has been</i>
<i>assaulted by the media.</i>

35:33.799 --> 35:35.341
<i>It's gone crazy.</i>

35:36.968 --> 35:39.846
[Nick] <i>We already had good pictures</i>
<i>of Meredith.</i>

35:39.930 --> 35:43.975
<i>She was a terribly attractive woman.</i>

35:44.059 --> 35:46.853
And now we've got
Amanda Knox involved as well.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.065
<i>Pretty blonde girl, 20-something.</i>

35:50.148 --> 35:52.567
It had that sexual intrigue.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.569
[chuckles] Girl-on-girl crime,
if you like.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.031
<i>The pack were in their hotel room,</i>

35:58.114 --> 36:01.201
<i>and everyone was going, "Amanda Knox,"</i>
<i>tap, tap, tap, into their computer.</i>

36:02.035 --> 36:06.122
This picture pops up on MySpace
of Amanda Knox with a machine gun,

36:06.206 --> 36:09.042
<i>laughing hysterically</i>
<i>as she was firing it.</i>

36:09.125 --> 36:13.254
<i>We were thinking, "Wow, great.</i>
<i>She's a complete and utter nutjob."</i>

36:13.338 --> 36:15.006
We had Raffaele Sollecito,
tapped him in,

36:15.090 --> 36:17.592
<i>and there he was, dressed as a mummy,</i>
<i>with a meat cleaver.</i>

36:17.676 --> 36:21.805
I mean, you just couldn't ask
for any better material

36:21.888 --> 36:24.140
<i>to illustrate a story with.</i>

36:25.475 --> 36:26.977
[news anchor] <i>Raffaele collects knives.</i>

36:27.060 --> 36:30.689
<i>He drives a nice car.</i>
<i>He was majoring in engineering.</i>

36:30.772 --> 36:34.025
This guy wasn't very sexually experienced.

36:34.109 --> 36:39.740
<i>She might've been only the second person</i>
<i>that he'd ever had sex with.</i>

36:39.823 --> 36:41.908
And she'd sort of...
got her hooks into him.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.703
[news anchor] <i>She'd been seen nuzzling</i>
<i>with a boyfriend at a local shop</i>

36:44.786 --> 36:46.788
<i>as they bought underwear for her.</i>

36:46.872 --> 36:50.751
<i>The store owner said he heard them</i>
<i>laughing about having hot sex that night,</i>

36:50.834 --> 36:54.379
<i>just a day after her roommate</i>
<i>had been found murdered.</i>

36:54.462 --> 36:57.590
[Nick] "La <i>Femme Fatale,"</i>
"La Dominatrice,"

36:57.673 --> 37:01.261
"Amanda Mangiatrice Di Uomini,"
<i>Amanda the man-eater.</i>

37:03.554 --> 37:08.143
<i>Finally, you have her own name</i>
<i>for herself, "Foxy Knoxy."</i>

37:08.226 --> 37:13.148
It was a perfect headline, really,
the perfect name.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.151
<i>I mean, it was a feeding frenzy</i>
<i>for everyone, basically.</i>

37:16.234 --> 37:17.944
<i>I mean, you were getting front pages.</i>

37:18.028 --> 37:20.155
<i>I don't think I've ever had</i>
<i>so many front pages.</i>

37:20.238 --> 37:21.823
[chuckles]

37:21.907 --> 37:26.494
Front page after front page,
page lead in the paper after page lead.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.454
Just story after story.

37:39.007 --> 37:43.762
[reporter in Italian]
Patrick! How are you, Patrick?

37:43.845 --> 37:46.597
[Patrick in Italian] I'm good.

37:46.681 --> 37:50.685
Thank God I get to go home.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.355
[reporter 2 in Italian] Patrick!
Why did Amanda accuse you?

37:55.481 --> 37:57.150
[reporter 3 in Italian]
What do you think of Amanda?

37:57.233 --> 37:59.277
[reporter 4 in Italian] Why did Amanda
say those things?

38:00.862 --> 38:02.738
[Giuliano in Italian]
<i>Why did she falsely accuse him?</i>

38:02.823 --> 38:05.951
Can you give me an answer?

38:06.034 --> 38:08.912
I think it's a little bit hard, huh?

38:08.995 --> 38:12.999
The only reason would be

38:13.083 --> 38:16.878
to divert the investigation away from her.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.302
[Amanda in English]
<i>And so in comes Giuliano Mignini.</i>

38:26.721 --> 38:30.809
<i>I just remember that he was a big man,</i>
<i>very solemn.</i>

38:30.892 --> 38:35.981
[in Italian] I asked her,
"Why did you accuse Patrick?"

38:36.064 --> 38:39.400
[Amanda in English] <i>Why? I was stressed.</i>
<i>I was scared.</i>

38:39.484 --> 38:42.320
<i>It was after long hours.</i>
<i>It was in the middle of the night.</i>

38:42.403 --> 38:45.656
<i>I was innocent, and they were telling me</i>
<i>that I was guilty.</i>

38:47.033 --> 38:49.702
[Giuliano in Italian]
<i>For the record, she's crying. </i>

38:51.579 --> 38:55.876
[in English] I told him it was because
they had said that I had met him.

38:55.959 --> 39:00.171
<i>They had shown me his text message</i>
<i>and said that I had met him,</i>

39:00.255 --> 39:04.968
<i>and that I must have not remembered it</i>
<i>because it was so traumatizing.</i>

39:05.051 --> 39:07.428
[in Italian]
She kept insisting and insisting,

39:07.512 --> 39:09.722
"They told me to say Lumumba's name.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.308
They told me to. They told me to."
I didn't understand this.

39:13.601 --> 39:16.354
<i>Earlier she said</i>
<i>that it could have been true.</i>

39:16.437 --> 39:19.815
[Amanda in English] <i>In that moment,</i>
<i>I thought it could have been true.</i>

39:19.900 --> 39:25.071
[in Italian] Usually a person says,
"That's true" or "That's not true."

39:25.155 --> 39:30.035
But Amanda had a very unusual
way of reasoning.

39:30.118 --> 39:35.165
She kept going between dream and reality.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.333
He just kept asking the question again.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.960
Again and again and again.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.297
"No, why did you...
Why did you say, 'Patrick Lumumba'?"

39:42.380 --> 39:45.716
You made me believe I met Patrick Lumumba.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.262
Therefore, I said Patrick Lumumba.

39:51.973 --> 39:56.061
<i>It wasn't the answer that he wanted,</i>
<i>and I realized that, and I...</i>

39:56.769 --> 39:58.604
was devastated.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.190
Like, when that happened,

40:00.273 --> 40:03.859
I realized that they weren't
ever going to listen to me again.

40:03.944 --> 40:06.112
[in Italian] This is Amanda's weakness.

40:06.196 --> 40:09.782
She can't stand being questioned.

40:09.865 --> 40:15.621
And she also has an attitude...
hostility and rebellion toward authority.

40:15.705 --> 40:17.540
It's a little bit anarchist.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.127
[stutters]

40:21.211 --> 40:25.048
I don't know if there is
such an attitude in Seattle.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.341
This I don't know.

40:26.424 --> 40:30.095
It's possible to speculate of course,

40:30.178 --> 40:32.347
but instead I choose to stick
to the facts.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.862
[Nick] <i>I've always wanted to be</i>
<i>a journalist ever since I was a kid.</i>

40:49.489 --> 40:51.866
<i>I mean, everyone knows</i>
<i>Woodward and Bernstein.</i>

40:51.950 --> 40:55.996
<i>I mean, I wouldn't dream of putting</i>
<i>myself in their shoes or anything,</i>

40:56.079 --> 40:57.956
<i>but I'm naturally nosy as well,</i>

40:58.039 --> 41:01.209
which is always a good talent to have,
if you like,

41:01.292 --> 41:04.504
if you can call it a talent,
to be a journalist.

41:08.549 --> 41:12.262
<i>Amanda was in a cell at Capanne jail</i>
<i>with two other inmates.</i>

41:13.054 --> 41:15.806
<i>She obviously underwent</i>
<i>a medical examination.</i>

41:15.890 --> 41:17.017
<i>She had a blood test,</i>

41:17.100 --> 41:20.186
<i>and they then told her</i>
<i>that she was HIV-positive</i>

41:20.270 --> 41:22.981
<i>and that she was going to develop AIDS.</i>

41:24.357 --> 41:28.611
<i>I remember she was writing in her diary</i>
<i>that she was terrified.</i>

41:28.694 --> 41:31.031
<i>She was saying that she wanted</i>
<i>to have a family,</i>

41:31.114 --> 41:34.117
<i>and that idea was now scuppered.</i>

41:34.200 --> 41:37.203
And then she was, sort of,
listing all her lovers and saying

41:37.287 --> 41:39.789
oh, she remembered using protection
with that one,

41:39.872 --> 41:40.915
and not with that one.

41:40.999 --> 41:45.003
<i>And this was all in her diary,</i>
<i>which, again, was leaked.</i>

41:45.086 --> 41:47.005
<i>I mean, I managed</i>
<i>to get ahold of it as well.</i>

41:47.088 --> 41:50.550
<i>I was probably one of the first people</i>
<i>who managed to get ahold of it.</i>

41:50.633 --> 41:53.094
[interviewer] How did that diary even
get to the press?

41:53.178 --> 41:54.220
[chuckles]

41:54.304 --> 41:56.889
Well, we never...
we never reveal our sources.

41:56.972 --> 41:58.141
That's the key thing.

41:58.224 --> 41:59.725
'Cause you do that,

41:59.809 --> 42:03.646
and then you're just betraying all
your journalistic principles, aren't you?

42:21.789 --> 42:24.417
<i>And then it turned out</i>
<i>that she didn't have HIV,</i>

42:24.500 --> 42:26.586
<i>and it was just mind games</i>
<i>being played on her</i>

42:26.669 --> 42:29.172
<i>by the police and the prosecution.</i>

42:30.506 --> 42:32.133
At the time, people were saying,

42:32.217 --> 42:36.346
"Oh, how could you do that?
How could you cover such a story?

42:36.429 --> 42:38.889
And how could you be involved?"

42:38.973 --> 42:41.851
And yet at the same time,
these are the same people who are...

42:41.934 --> 42:44.062
logging onto the Internet
first thing in the morning,

42:44.145 --> 42:47.148
trying to find out the latest details,
you know?

42:49.317 --> 42:52.027
[thunder rumbling]

42:59.660 --> 43:00.661
[car door closes]

43:15.968 --> 43:18.179
[in Italian] Enough.
You've already filmed enough.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.268
[shutters clicking]

43:26.354 --> 43:28.314
[indistinct chatter]

43:33.694 --> 43:34.904
[phone ringing]

43:34.987 --> 43:39.033
[man] Hello? Come over here.
We are at Sollecito's.

43:39.950 --> 43:43.829
[Giuliano] <i>The knife that was used</i>
<i>in the murder still hadn't been found.</i>

43:45.956 --> 43:49.877
<i>They did a search at Sollecito's house.</i>

43:50.545 --> 43:54.590
<i>They went into the kitchen</i>
<i>and found a number of knives.</i>

43:54.674 --> 43:59.970
<i>And they found one that matched</i>
<i>the characteristics of the murder.</i>

44:01.514 --> 44:06.394
It is a kitchen knife found
in Sollecito's house,

44:06.477 --> 44:08.938
which he shared with Amanda Knox.

44:09.021 --> 44:12.233
The knife.
The knife is a fundamental element.

44:13.651 --> 44:19.240
<i>Amanda's DNA was found on the handle.</i>

44:22.952 --> 44:27.415
<i>Meredith's DNA was found</i>
<i>on the tip of the blade.</i>

44:30.084 --> 44:36.257
The knife was found
after a search ordered by me.

44:37.883 --> 44:40.928
[Amanda in English]
<i>The knife, I could not explain.</i>

44:41.011 --> 44:44.307
There was no reason for my DNA
to have been on a handle,

44:44.390 --> 44:46.434
and Meredith's DNA
to have been on the blade.

44:47.227 --> 44:48.561
<i>It was impossible.</i>

44:55.235 --> 44:57.487
[man in Italian] It's soaked in blood.

44:57.570 --> 45:00.531
Therefore, she had it on her
when she was killed.

45:02.367 --> 45:03.826
[woman] This has been ripped.

45:03.909 --> 45:07.455
[man] The part with the clasp is missing.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.499
[man 2] Here it is.

45:12.502 --> 45:17.548
[Giuliano] <i>After some time,</i>
<i>we found that Meredith's bra clasp</i>

45:17.632 --> 45:21.802
<i>contained traces of Sollecito's DNA.</i>

45:28.934 --> 45:32.813
This is a very significant fact.

45:32.897 --> 45:38.235
I remember my colleagues
complimenting me and saying,

45:38.319 --> 45:43.283
"At this point,
there's no hope for the two of them."

45:54.794 --> 46:00.174
[Raffaele] <i>I grew up in the southern part</i>
<i>of Italy, close to the sea.</i>

46:01.676 --> 46:03.678
<i>I was very shy.</i>

46:04.429 --> 46:07.348
<i>And I didn't date girls.</i>

46:07.432 --> 46:14.104
Who cares when you can have
the new Sega Mega Drive or PlayStation?

46:15.606 --> 46:18.401
<i>So, when I was with Amanda,</i>

46:18.484 --> 46:23.823
I was so happy to enjoy life
and to enjoy my new relationship.

46:25.991 --> 46:29.995
<i>Why should I go and murder a girl?</i>

46:30.913 --> 46:33.791
<i>This, for me, is craziness.</i>

46:33.874 --> 46:39.630
Now, I'm taking part of this nightmare,
on this tragedy,

46:39.714 --> 46:43.092
and my life is going to be destroyed...

46:45.386 --> 46:47.304
forever by all this...

46:48.639 --> 46:50.766
if nothing changes.

47:06.407 --> 47:10.077

<i>Let it be clear</i>

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.333
how easy it is to leave traces of DNA.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:46.966
<i>You move your hand on your arm,</i>
<i>that small amount of fine dust,</i>

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.136
<i>those are all DNA traces which we spread</i>

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:54.558
<i>within the area where we are</i>
<i>in that particular moment.</i>

01:04:57.644 --> 01:05:04.275
<i>Therefore, a crime scene</i>
<i>must be kept completely sterile.</i>

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:07.487
That's not what happened in this case.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:16.496
<i>In the video taken by the forensic police,</i>
<i>there was a lot of chaos.</i>

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:24.588
<i>You can see clearly a coming and going</i>
<i>of people without protective suits.</i>

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:28.091
<i>Booties were not changed.</i>

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:33.472
<i>And they rarely change their gloves.</i>

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:38.602
In other words, total chaos.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:43.982
[glass shattering]

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.568
<i>Chaos.</i>

01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:51.405
<i>That, the forensic police</i>
<i>expressed themselves.</i>

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:54.868
[officer 1] This is absurd. Really absurd.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.370
[officer 2] I criticized it harshly.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:06:02.208
[officer 1] There's unbelievable
disorganization in every respect.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:10.467
[Dr. Vecchiotti] <i>Contamination was</i>
<i>one of the issues raised by the court.</i>

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.052
<i>Could there be a contamination?</i>

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.099
<i>The bra clasp was found under a small rug</i>

01:06:18.182 --> 01:06:20.560
<i>46 days after the murder.</i>

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:24.147
[Dr. Conti] <i>After 46 days,</i>

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:30.487
<i>it's possible that other people</i>
<i>could have brought DNA traces</i>

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.698
<i>from the hallway, the bathroom,</i>
<i>kitchen or other rooms,</i>

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.660
<i>into Meredith's room.</i>

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:41.956
[Dr. Vecchiotti] <i>In fact, on the clasp,</i>
<i>there's Sollecito's DNA profile,</i>

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.458
<i>but there were at least two others.</i>

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:49.714
<i>But the police never noted them</i>
<i>as evidence.</i>

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.217
<i>DNA must be objective.</i>

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:58.848
You can't interpret it
for what you want it to be.

01:07:02.226 --> 01:07:04.062
<i>And I must say that...</i>

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:07.857
<i>there were also problems</i>
<i>with contamination in the laboratory.</i>

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:15.949
<i>The forensics police</i>
<i>definitively identified Amanda's profile.</i>

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:22.914
<i>You could see it very well.</i>
<i>It was a good profile.</i>

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:31.548
<i>But with regards to Meredith's DNA found,</i>

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:35.677
<i>it was such a small amount, so scarce.</i>

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:39.097
<i>When you have such scarce DNA,</i>

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.892
<i>the likelihood of contamination</i>
<i>is very high.</i>

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:52.318
<i>So we asked the forensic police,</i>

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:56.072
"When analyzing the knife,
did you analyze it alone,

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:57.616
without any other evidence?"

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:04.706
<i>And she replied, "No, we examined</i>
<i>50 of Kercher's samples at the same time.</i>

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:09.628
The laboratory couldn't just shut down
because Kercher had died."

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:14.674
<i>When she reported these things,</i>

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:20.680
I was sure the results
were because of contamination.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:24.225

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:30.273
[Nick in English] <i>When it came out,</i>
<i>I mean, it was just... crazy.</i>

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:33.734
The botched investigation
and the bungled forensic work.

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:37.613
I remember audible gasps from the press
and from everyone in the court.

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:45.537
<i>We're all looking, as journalists,</i>
<i>for that great angle or that great line.</i>

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.207
<i>And when you see something like that,</i>
<i>you just think,</i>

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.334
"Brilliant.
It's manna from heaven, it really is."

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:53.087
Amanda Knox's hand was said
to have been on that knife.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:56.215
It was said to have
murdered the victim in this case.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.759
No DNA.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:58.885
What?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.220
This is Italy, Shepard, it's a crazy...

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.389
It's a little different
than we're used to.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:04.557
Bunga bunga.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.810
-[laughing]
-One of... The one guy who...

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:08.937
The thing I can't wrap
my mind around, though,

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:13.232
is if the DNA evidence isn't credible,
how did things get to this point?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.693
You really believe

01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:18.112
that Americans should intervene
at the top levels of our government?

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.782
I think the president should get involved.

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:23.367
I think people should boycott Italy.
They shouldn't go to Italy.

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:28.957
[in Italian] It bothered me that the
American media lectured us about the law.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:34.837
<i>This courthouse, in 1308,</i>

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:40.969
<i>housed the first faculty of law in Europe.</i>

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:47.265
In America, in 1308,
they were drawing buffalos in caves.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:05.034
[Giuliano] <i>I was irritated</i>
<i>by all this avalanche of attacks,</i>

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:08.747
<i>especially against me and the police.</i>

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:13.752
<i>The American media was focusing</i>
<i>only on the DNA.</i>

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:19.673
Every piece of proof has aspects...
of uncertainty.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:26.264
<i>That's why evidence needs to be</i>
<i>evaluated in its entirety.</i>

01:10:28.682 --> 01:10:30.226
<i>I hear talk...</i>

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:34.522
<i>"For me, Amanda is guilty</i>
<i>because she said too many lies."</i>

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:40.862
<i>I have to remind you that her behavior</i>
<i>was completely inexplicable.</i>

01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:43.156
<i>Totally irrational.</i>

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.283
There's no doubt of this.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.497
[Amanda in Knox] <i>There is no trace of me</i>
<i>in the room where Meredith was murdered,</i>

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:56.335
<i>and there's no reliable trace of Raffaele</i>
<i>in the room where Meredith was murdered.</i>

01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:06.387
You're looking at me.
Why?

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.848
These are my eyes.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.351
They're not objective evidence.

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:16.940
<i>What's more likely?</i>

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:19.943

[interviewer] I don't understand.

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:27.445
Ask the others who had a better defense

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.742

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:23.574
And I'm inside a tragedy still.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:26.702
[reporter] Congratulations.
Congratulations, Amanda.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:29.663
-Please leave me alone, please.
-[reporter chuckles] Welcome home.

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:31.499
Welcome home, Amanda.

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:34.585
Does it feel good to be home?

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.546
What did you miss most about Seattle?

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.883
[news anchor] <i>It's really a matter of</i>
<i>what does she do with this newfound fame?</i>

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.593
<i>Does she write the book</i>
<i>and move on with her life?</i>

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:45.304
<i>Does she then try to go on</i>
Dancing with the Stars?

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:48.516
<i>That's where we're gonna really see</i>
<i>what her motivations are.</i>

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:51.184
[reporter 1] <i>What movie offers</i>
<i>have you received?</i>

01:18:51.269 --> 01:18:53.437
That's not our focus
at this point in time.

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.439
Our focus is her, uh, well-being.

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:57.275
[reporter 2] Are you aware that,
I suppose,

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.026
the longer you leave it, in a sense,

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:04.282
the less, you know, the less money
you're going to get ultimately?

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.449
What you mean is?

01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:06.742
[reporter 2] Well, you're not such...

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:11.455
She's not such a hot property
on an interview term if you wait a month.

01:19:11.539 --> 01:19:12.581
Um...

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:14.833
I'm not looking at her
as a hot property.

01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:26.387
[Amanda] <i>I really thought</i>
<i>that I was going to be okay.</i>

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:41.735
<i>But I wasn't the same person</i>
<i>to come back to Seattle.</i>

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.702
<i>The whole world knew</i>
<i>who I had ever had sex with.</i>

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:53.163
<i>Seven men.</i>

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:59.587
<i>And yet, I was some heinous whore.</i>

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:04.300
<i>Bestial and sex-obsessed and unnatural.</i>

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:11.724
<i>I'd get into a line at the grocery store</i>
<i>and the person behind me is like,</i>

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.225
<i>"Whoa!</i>

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.019
<i>It's you!</i>

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.855
<i>I know you!"</i>

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:24.027
<i>And I really wanna turn to them and say,</i>
<i>"Who the fuck are you?</i>

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:27.406
And you don't know me."

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:37.750
<i>You have to wonder what is it</i>
<i>that everyone really cares about?</i>

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.254
<i>But how entertaining.</i>

01:21:04.402 --> 01:21:06.153
[indistinct chatter]

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:08.071

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:12.993
[news anchor 1] <i>Italy's top appeals court</i>

<i>Phones had to be turned off</i>

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:05.378
They'll be turned on as soon

[man] <i>Attention!</i>

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:26.108
The news is that Raffaele Sollecito

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:32.155

I know! This is crazy!

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:46.336
[laughing]

01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:49.172
Raffaele?

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.469
[in Italian] We're free!

01:22:53.552 --> 01:22:55.638
How are you?

01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:59.141
I'm so happy for you.
I'm so happy for us.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.226

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:03.687

01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:08.191
Much love and we'll talk soon.

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:09.943
Bye.

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.949
-[woman 1 in English] Oh, my God.
-[woman 2] Oh, my God!

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.920
[Arlene Kercher] <i>The first reaction</i>
<i>was one of surprise. Uh...</i>

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:13.006
They've had two convictions...

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:15.133
um...

01:24:16.509 --> 01:24:18.762
and they've had two acquittals now.

01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:25.060
It seems an awful long time
to get such a strange verdict.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:27.020
Um, eight years.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:33.068
So it's sort of bringing
everything into disrepute.

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:42.870
[Nick] <i>I think at the end of the day,</i>
<i>you have to point the finger</i>

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:46.039
<i>at the police, really,</i>
<i>and the prosecution.</i>

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:48.458
They made some really heinous errors

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:55.298
and they got fixated on some wild theories
that they were absolutely obsessed with.

01:24:56.759 --> 01:25:00.220
<i>I know people keep saying</i>
<i>"Trial by media, trial by media," but...</i>

01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:03.807
<i>I don't buy that.</i>

01:25:03.891 --> 01:25:07.310
Maybe 'cause I'm a journalist so
I don't go for that, but... [chuckles]

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:13.358
<i>I think now, looking back,</i>
<i>some of the information that came out</i>

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:18.446
<i>was just crazy, really,</i>
<i>and just completely made up.</i>

01:25:20.908 --> 01:25:23.786
But, hey, what are we supposed to do,
you know?

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:26.997
We are journalists and we are reporting
what we are being told.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.582
It's not as if I can say,
"Right, hold on a minute.

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:33.045
I just wanna double check that myself
in some other way."

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:34.379
I mean, goodness knows how.

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.965
And then I let my rival get in there
first before me,

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:38.676
and then, hey, I've lost a scoop.

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:42.345
<i>It doesn't work like that.</i>

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:44.181
<i>Not in the news game.</i>

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:58.111
[Giuliano in Italian] <i>During the trial</i>
<i>there was a woman who...</i>

01:25:58.195 --> 01:26:01.323
<i>She said I was the devil.</i>

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:04.117
[in English] "You are evil."

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:09.081
[in Italian] <i>I can say</i>
<i>that I've made mistakes,</i>

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.461
<i>even things that I have had to confess,</i>

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:18.674
<i>but we are all between good and evil.</i>

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:23.095
<i>It's in our human nature.</i>

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:30.643
<i>Amanda and Sollecito,</i>
<i>if they are innocent,</i>

01:26:30.728 --> 01:26:37.025
<i>I hope they're able to forget</i>
<i>the suffering that they've endured.</i>

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:43.699
<i>If they're guilty,</i>
<i>if earthly justice didn't get to them,</i>

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:47.660
<i>I hope they own their guilt,</i>

01:26:47.745 --> 01:26:52.665
<i>because I know that life ends</i>
<i>with a final trial.</i>

01:26:53.666 --> 01:27:00.257
<i>A trial with no appeals,</i>
<i>no second chances, and no revisions.</i>

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:09.307
[boat engine humming]

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:33.790
[Amanda] <i>I think people love monsters.</i>

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:39.755
<i>And so when they get the chance,</i>
<i>they want to see them.</i>

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.351
<i>It's people projecting their fears.</i>

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:04.487
<i>They want the reassurance that...</i>

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:08.241
<i>they know who the bad people are,</i>
<i>and it's not them.</i>

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.584
So maybe that's what it is.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:19.211
We're all afraid.

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:22.672
And fear makes people crazy.
