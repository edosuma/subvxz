00:08.050 --> 00:09.635
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.719 --> 00:12.304
This was found in deposit box 143.

00:12.388 --> 00:13.681
Why did you want it?

00:13.764 --> 00:16.434
We both know there are currencies
stronger than money.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.019
Miss Carter,
since our last adventure,

00:18.102 --> 00:20.021
I'm exhaustively bored.
Allow me to drive you around.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.689
Mrs Jarvis!

00:21.772 --> 00:24.150
- I feel like I already know you.
- Oh. Oh!

00:24.525 --> 00:25.568
She hugs.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.153
Hello. Chief.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.320
Welcome to Los Angeles.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.447
<i>The SSR came on board</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:32.283
<i>because a body of water
froze during a heat wave.</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:33.534
She was near a particle accelerator.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.077
There's another one
at Isodyne Energy.

00:35.161 --> 00:37.830
- Here's my business card.
- Thank you, Dr Wilkes.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.123
There's Calvin Chadwick.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.042
And his wife, Whitney Frost.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.668
I clean up other people's messes.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.837
- We can work this out.
- They're not gonna let us.

00:46.589 --> 00:49.300
I want to thank you properly
for saving my life.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.551
How about dinner and dancing?

00:50.634 --> 00:53.637
I make it my policy
not to socialize with persons of interest.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.347
But it's nice to know
you find me interesting.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.433
<i>See, hon?
You figured out how to fix it all.</i>

00:57.516 --> 01:00.227
<i>And that's the last time
we should have to dirty our hands, hmm?</i>

01:00.311 --> 01:02.813
Just because you dirtied
other parts of your anatomy.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.066
God, I could do with a drink.
How about you?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.193
<i>I can't tonight.
Maybe another time?</i>

01:21.707 --> 01:23.375
One, two, three.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.676
Good lord, man!

01:33.010 --> 01:34.804
Ah. Yes.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.266
The attire is a touch primitive,

01:39.350 --> 01:42.853
but I've found that free range of motion
is imperative.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.356
I had no idea your interests
were so diverse.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.692
Since our adventures in New York,

01:48.776 --> 01:51.028
I've begun a regimented
physical-fitness routine.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.989
- Ah.
- As well as training in the deadly arts.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.783
Ah, the deadly arts, you say?

01:59.120 --> 02:02.873
Fencing is a gentleman's pursuit
and my hobby.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.625
Mmm-hmm.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.546
Look, my combat training focuses
primarily on boxing.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.297
Queensberry rules, of course.

02:10.381 --> 02:11.549
And judo.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.927
I've actually developed into
rather a dangerous judoka.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.555
How many butlers can say that?

02:19.265 --> 02:20.432
Here.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.146
Try to take me down.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.313
No, no, I don't think...

02:26.397 --> 02:28.899
Please, Miss Carter,
I am quite prepared for you.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.068
Oh!

02:31.443 --> 02:33.028
- Hmm.
- Really?

02:33.112 --> 02:34.738
Mr Jarvis, I really wouldn't
do that if I...

02:34.822 --> 02:36.115
Don't be shy!
I shan't hurt you too badly.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.075
I really don't think you want to do that,
Mr Jarvis.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.078
Mr Jarvis, would you...

02:41.162 --> 02:43.038
I learned that one from my brother.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.588
Oh! Mr Jarvis!

02:50.671 --> 02:52.298
Good morning, you two.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.511
Did he catch you with his patented
tortoise of fury?

02:57.595 --> 03:00.181
Oh, is that what he's calling it?

03:00.264 --> 03:01.765
Ana's been my sparring partner

03:01.849 --> 03:03.559
- for the past 12 months.
- Oh.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.269
She knows all my strengths
and weaknesses.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.729
Thank you, darling.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.231
He's never more lethal than when
he's flat on his back.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.360
Tea's on.

03:13.444 --> 03:15.946
Unless you'd prefer to go
for another round with my husband.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.239
Oh, thank you. No.

03:17.323 --> 03:18.699
Um, Mr Jarvis,

03:18.782 --> 03:21.368
if you wouldn't mind slipping into
something less athletic,

03:21.452 --> 03:22.870
I could use a ride to the office.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.165
There's work to be done,
and I'm just getting started.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.875
Very well.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.169
So, you haven't told her.

03:30.753 --> 03:31.962
Not yet, Rose.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.048
- Are you gonna tell her?
- Yes, Rose.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.466
Well, what are you waiting for?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.302
It didn't really come up when we were
chasing Officer Icicle.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.888
Daniel, you're a nice guy.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.389
Oh, that's just mean.

03:42.473 --> 03:45.976
Look, all I'm saying is,
the longer you wait to tell her,

03:46.060 --> 03:47.728
the more awkward it's gonna be

03:47.853 --> 03:49.188
when they meet.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.190
There he is.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.859
- I got to start my shift.
- Ah.

03:53.943 --> 03:57.029
I dropped off cookies.
Peggy's already had three.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.282
It was the best meal I've had since
arriving in Los Angeles.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.659
So, you... You two have met.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.078
Would you believe my grandfather's
from her hometown?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.204
She's practically family.

04:05.287 --> 04:09.375
- Well, small world, isn't it, Chief Sousa?
- Yeah, tiny.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.168
But I do want to
show you around, Peggy.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.628
We'll hit all the tourist traps.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.714
Actually, what are you doing tonight?
Do you want to join us for dinner?

04:15.839 --> 04:18.467
- Oh, no, I don't think that...
- It's right on the beach.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.511
You can't come to L.A.
and not see the ocean.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.097
Well, I...
The reservation's for two, so...

04:23.180 --> 04:25.557
We'll pull up a chair. You're coming.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.726
Now I'm late.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.022
Um,

04:32.106 --> 04:33.482
Daniel, I don't mean to intrude.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.942
Uh, no, no. It'll be fun.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.402
Besides, you heard Violet.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.404
If you don't show, she'll throttle me.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.406
All right.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.032
Um,
we've sent our men to pick up

04:42.116 --> 04:43.367
the body of Jane Scott from the morgue.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.660
It should be here by midday.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.828
We need our scientists to identify

04:45.911 --> 04:47.288
the mysterious substance that killed her

04:47.371 --> 04:49.206
if we're gonna get anywhere
on the case.

04:49.665 --> 04:50.874
Sounds great.

04:51.875 --> 04:52.918
Cookie?

05:29.371 --> 05:31.123
Ah.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.208
Chadwick, good to see you.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.128
How about a Scotch, Eddie, my boy?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.379
Right away, Mr Chadwick.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.173
The gentlemen are in the meeting room.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.008
Are they?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.635
Shall I bring your drink to you there?

05:43.719 --> 05:46.055
Uh... Yeah.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.806
Sure.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.243
Gentlemen, I didn't know we had
a meeting on the books.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.371
Take a seat, Calvin.

06:12.790 --> 06:13.832
Ah.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.260
In light of recent events,
the Council has determined

06:25.344 --> 06:29.139
our best course of action is to
shut down the Isodyne programme

06:29.223 --> 06:31.141
and dispose of all assets.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.351
"The Council"?

06:32.434 --> 06:33.977
Well, Tom, I'm on the Council.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.731
Thus far, your experiments
have yielded no results

06:37.815 --> 06:40.401
and attracted a federal investigation.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.736
You can understand our concerns.

06:42.820 --> 06:46.490
- Well, we suffered a setback, yes, but...
- And accidents will happen.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.369
Failure is often a key component
to progress.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.247
Yes, I'm still living off the dividends
from the crash of '29,

06:53.330 --> 06:57.000
a crash that Tom here
had the vision to orchestrate.

06:57.084 --> 07:01.130
But your programme has put
all of our interests in jeopardy.

07:01.213 --> 07:05.759
We are in possession of what could be
the greatest discovery of all time.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.387
You've failed to illustrate
that to us, Calvin.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.805
Well...

07:09.888 --> 07:11.849
I mean, I'm not a scientist.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.268
All I can say is that sharper minds
than ours

07:14.351 --> 07:17.479
tell me this substance is
potentially priceless.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.565
Atomic energy isn't even regulated yet,

07:19.648 --> 07:22.526
and Isodyne is set to make it
a thing of the past.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.070
This project could make us billions...

07:26.905 --> 07:30.492
The decision's been made.

07:33.162 --> 07:37.082
The woman's body is being
taken care of as we speak.

07:37.166 --> 07:40.335
Tonight, our men will clear out
the laboratory.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.713
And following that,

07:42.796 --> 07:46.049
all connection to the programme
will be terminated.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.052
You shouldn't
take this personally, Calvin.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.346
Your interests are our interests.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.558
Your primary focus now
should be the Senate race.

07:54.725 --> 07:58.812
Hmm, we've already contributed
a considerable amount

07:58.896 --> 08:00.647
towards your campaign.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.443
Yeah.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.821
You're right.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.836
No sign of Jane Scott's body.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.048
Agent Beringer was a Marine.
Three tours.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.883
White had a damn black belt.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.718
This was a professional hit.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.888
Clearly, we've kicked
a very formidable hornet's nest.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.723
This case is much larger
than we initially thought.

08:34.806 --> 08:35.849
Chief Sousa.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.644
New York wanted you to get this ASAP.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.729
Thompson got us
the Isodyne search warrant.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.314
Want to kick that nest again?

08:42.397 --> 08:43.857
Let's stomp it to the ground.

08:43.941 --> 08:46.235
Hello. Welcome to Isodyne.
Is there anything...

08:46.318 --> 08:47.694
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.030
You can help me by opening the door
or we will open it by force.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.657
Peggy.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.578
There was a small containment leak,
and the lab is currently under isolation.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.414
Well, how convenient.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.458
- Dr Wilkes!
- Uh, Agent Carter.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.793
Good... Good afternoon.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.087
What is this nonsense about
a containment leak?

09:05.170 --> 09:09.174
Oh, yes, th... There was a leak,
and I'm afraid that the lab is...

09:09.258 --> 09:10.384
Under isolation. We heard.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.386
And when might the lab be safe enough
to enter again?

09:12.803 --> 09:14.012
I don't...

09:14.888 --> 09:16.431
Um...

09:17.182 --> 09:20.102
Um, these things sometimes
take some time.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.771
Isodyne is up to something,
and I'm going to find out what.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.857
Be careful you don't get caught up
in the crossfire.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.778
I'm sorry. I'm needed elsewhere.
Thank you for coming.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.327
He knows something.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.204
We should've arrested him last night.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.956
I don't think that would've been
our best option.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.916
Don't tell me you believe
that garbage about radiation.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.293
No, but I do think

09:44.376 --> 09:47.421
that Dr Wilkes is interested in
cooperating with us.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.300
We may find some answers after all.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.360
Yeah. All right. Thanks.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.779
The Dunbar Hotel downtown.

10:53.862 --> 10:54.988
What do you know about it?

10:55.072 --> 10:56.573
I've been before. It's a great time.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.158
Real hot spot for the coloured crowd.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.702
Violet and I watched Ella Fitzgerald
sing there.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.955
Still, you're gonna need backup.
I'll cancel my dinner.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.166
- The note says, "Come alone."
- Ah, right.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.834
Whenever I'm planning to
ambush somebody,

11:07.918 --> 11:09.628
I always ask them to bring along
some friends.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.505
Even if that is the case,
and I don't think it is,

11:11.588 --> 11:13.590
I can handle myself, Daniel.

11:13.674 --> 11:14.925
Well, this time, you don't need to.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.761
I got a change of clothes in my locker.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.638
It's a pretty swanky place.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.348
You might want to get yourself
dolled up a little bit.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.767
I'm perfectly "dolled up", thank you.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.811
Just don't want you to embarrass me.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.479
Oh.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.814
- Oh, wait.
- Oh, whoops.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.357
No, it's okay. I'll get it.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.733
Thanks, I...

11:34.236 --> 11:35.404
I'm sorry.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.447
- Don't be.
- It's very beautiful.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.241
- I didn't mean for you...
- So your dinner tonight...

11:43.537 --> 11:46.790
Will you please tell Violet
I'm sorry I couldn't make dinner?

11:56.133 --> 11:57.968
I'm very happy for you, Daniel.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.563
Plans for the evening?

12:09.646 --> 12:12.607
Just work, but I'm told
I must look "swanky".

12:12.733 --> 12:15.736
Hmm.
What are the other agents wearing?

12:15.819 --> 12:16.945
I'm going alone.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.781
Chief Sousa has other plans.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.366
There are no other agents?

12:21.450 --> 12:22.951
Well, he's the only one that matters.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.620
I mean, that...
That would be useful, that is to say.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.999
- Where are you going?
- The Dunbar Hotel.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.168
Wonderful spot!
Do you dance?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.419
I prefer the East Coast swing,

12:32.502 --> 12:35.172
but Edwin is quite adept
at the Collegiate Shag.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.590
These won't do for dancing.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.134
No, I'm not dancing.
I'm simply meeting an informant.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.510
Hmm. Sounds dangerous.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.763
No, he's a scientist.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.431
Oh, very dull, then.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.975
Well, he's rather amusing, actually.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.977
He's a genius, absolutely.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.395
A bit odd.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.898
He's very interesting.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.150
It's nice to interact with someone
outside the SSR.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.027
It's been a long time since... Um, sorry.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.320
Uh, what were you saying?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.906
This will be perfect.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.577
I do wish you'd allow me to drive you,
Miss Carter.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.662
Your thirst for adventure is appreciated.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.874
Now, I thought Mr Stark's leisure car
would be appropriate.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.046
Couple of things I ought to show you.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.134
This button here is in case
you find yourself...

13:22.969 --> 13:24.179
Dehydrated.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.848
Howard Stark becomes more ridiculous
the longer I know him.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.685
This button here adjusts the tints
of the windows for extra privacy,

13:30.769 --> 13:33.188
there's a small compartment in the back
with a change of clothes,

13:33.271 --> 13:36.733
and this is what Mr Stark
affectionately refers to as his...

13:37.776 --> 13:39.319
"Sock on the doorknob."

13:39.402 --> 13:40.445
His what?

13:40.529 --> 13:42.113
It's a tracking device.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.533
Mr Stark activates it when he's
abandoned the car for the evening

13:44.616 --> 13:47.077
because he's found companionship.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.787
When I think Howard has reached
the depths of depravity,

13:48.870 --> 13:51.039
you dig up a wellspring, Mr Jarvis.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.249
Uh, radio?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.458
No.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.043
Oh!

13:56.461 --> 13:58.255
Good lord, is that a mirror?

14:17.482 --> 14:20.944
You could use some pointers
in choosing secret meeting locations.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.113
I thought it'd be best to meet
somewhere in public,

14:23.196 --> 14:24.948
somewhere we wouldn't get
a lot of looks.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.534
Very well.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.662
So, tell me what happened today
at the lab.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.040
One gin rickey, please,
and for the lady?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.458
No, thank you.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.793
Two gin rickeys.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.837
Nothing for me.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.841
So... Where'd you grow up?

14:43.842 --> 14:46.136
Dr Wilkes, I'm not here for small talk.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.804
A woman from your lab died,

14:47.888 --> 14:49.639
and two of my men were killed
to hide the evidence.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.974
I had nothing to do with that.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.352
Your refusal to explain yourself
just makes you look complicit.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.816
This morning when I arrived
at the office,

14:59.900 --> 15:01.735
I was escorted into a conference room

15:01.818 --> 15:03.904
stuffed to the seams
with corporate lawyers.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.864
They very helpfully reminded me

15:05.947 --> 15:09.242
of the highly classified nature
of the work we do at Isodyne

15:09.326 --> 15:12.495
and then threw around words
like "treason",

15:12.579 --> 15:14.039
"prison",

15:14.122 --> 15:15.790
and "hanging".

15:17.250 --> 15:18.418
It was a lot of fun.

15:18.501 --> 15:19.961
The SSR can protect you.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.713
I'm not talking to the SSR.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.214
I'm talking to you.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.843
And before I risk my career and my life,

15:26.927 --> 15:29.429
I'd like to know a little bit more
about the woman I'm trusting.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.854
I grew up in Hampstead,

15:37.938 --> 15:40.231
just outside of London.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.569
And I have changed my mind.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.446
I'm going to need a whisky. Neat.

15:48.865 --> 15:53.370
You are all I have in this world,
and you are all I've ever wanted.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.164
And if you leave me
and you go off to war,

15:56.247 --> 15:59.167
just the thought of
never seeing you again...

15:59.250 --> 16:01.878
Just the thought would crush me.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.340
And I couldn't stand it, my love.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.300
I couldn't stand being without you.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.804
I love you.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.306
I just...

16:14.182 --> 16:15.725
I love you.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.355
<i>Cut! Cut! Cut!</i>

16:20.814 --> 16:22.399
Reset, everybody.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.608
Very nice, Carl.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.735
Why don't you go take five?

16:25.819 --> 16:27.862
- Miss Frost.
- Yes?

16:27.946 --> 16:29.447
- Great work.
- Thank you.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.282
Just a couple adjustments.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.701
Can I get makeup over here, please?

16:32.784 --> 16:34.911
Thank you. Let's go. Let's go.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.581
Let's see if we can try
and get rid of the lines around her eyes.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.959
Can we do that? Great.
Let's talk about your wardrobe.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.794
Uh, can we bring it in any more?

16:42.877 --> 16:45.338
No. I can barely breathe as it is.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.298
Well, then, I guess someone's gonna be
skipping lunch today,

16:47.382 --> 16:48.550
isn't she?

16:48.633 --> 16:50.677
You are. You're my trooper.
You're my girl.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.803
- Hey, Ralph?
- Yes, sir?

16:51.886 --> 16:53.471
Can we, uh,
throw a few more lights on her?

16:53.555 --> 16:55.348
Yeah. I thought you said you knew
how to light older women.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.893
Where is wardrobe?
Wardrobe! Let's go!

17:02.355 --> 17:05.025
And suddenly, I was alone.
I had nowhere to turn.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.526
And it dawned on me

17:06.609 --> 17:09.779
that I was going to have to
face this all by myself.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.741
And the door opened and
Headmaster Portley walked in

17:12.824 --> 17:15.326
to find me wearing a bandit mask
in the middle of his bedroom,

17:15.410 --> 17:17.078
my hands filled with his wife's knickers

17:17.162 --> 17:18.913
and his most expensive bottle
of brandy.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.291
And your friends
just left you there?

17:21.374 --> 17:24.085
It was my fault, really.
It was greedy to go back for the liquor.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.378
And so, what happened?

17:25.462 --> 17:28.923
They broke a few switches on me,
but I was the school hero.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.300
But your friends got away.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.426
Hmm.

17:33.178 --> 17:36.014
Hmm. Maybe you're trustworthy after all.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.150
Ah, this is my song.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.028
- You can't be serious.
- I'm sorry.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.571
I have to dance whenever
I hear this song.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.156
Oh, you have to, do you?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.116
Just a few bars. Don't worry.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.078
I can still dance and spill my guts
at the same time.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.384
You know more than you're saying

18:13.468 --> 18:15.136
about Isodyne's involvement in all this,
don't you?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.182
I have a pretty good idea.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.936
Did Calvin Chadwick kill Jane Scott?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.772
No.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.274
Not deliberately, in any event.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.402
But would he kill

18:31.486 --> 18:33.571
to cover up the research that
we've been conducting?

18:35.698 --> 18:37.784
Yeah. I think he would.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.748
It's bigger than you think it is.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.292
Bigger than even Mr Chadwick thinks.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.710
What is it?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.506
Best way to explain is to show you.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.799
Come on.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.982
- Thanks for the drinks.
- My pleasure.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.733
- Have a good night.
- You, too, sir.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.090
Well?

19:34.591 --> 19:35.675
They're scrapping it.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.847
Zero Matter,
the experiments, everything.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.980
We have at our fingertips
a means to change the world,

19:49.063 --> 19:50.607
and they just want to throw it away.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.695
Zero Matter could make atomic energy
as obsolete as the steam engine.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.071
I told them that.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.615
They think there's too much risk,

19:58.698 --> 20:02.327
what with all the press
surrounding the lab right now.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.578
Press we wouldn't have

20:03.661 --> 20:05.747
if you had been better at
choosing your mistresses.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.915
I did what I could.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.125
They'd made the decision
before I'd even arrived.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.835
Then why didn't you stop them

20:10.919 --> 20:14.005
instead of letting them walk all over you
like you always do?

20:19.219 --> 20:21.304
Honey, I'm sorry.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.973
The Council was adamant.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.227
They're scrubbing the lab tonight.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.481
As of tomorrow, Zero Matter
will be gone.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.608
Listen, the Council...

20:34.525 --> 20:37.612
They really want me to focus
on my Senate campaign.

20:37.695 --> 20:40.907
But in the long run, isn't that better
for both of us?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.080
Yeah.

20:50.917 --> 20:51.960
Oh.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.670
I'm sorry.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.591
You're gonna make
a wonderful senator.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.056
I love you.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.267
I love you.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.686
That's my girl.

21:23.491 --> 21:24.951
I love coming up here.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.831
Helps me keep some perspective.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.251
I would think it would make you feel
rather insignificant.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.753
Oh, no.

21:36.838 --> 21:37.922
No.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.345
See where the lights sort of taper out
into nothing?

21:45.305 --> 21:47.015
That's where I grew up,

21:47.098 --> 21:49.517
working in the orange groves
with my family.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.853
Long days, scorching heat,

21:51.936 --> 21:55.189
always wanting out, wanting more...

21:55.273 --> 21:57.525
And everyone saying that
"You can't get out,

21:59.235 --> 22:01.362
"you don't deserve more."

22:04.532 --> 22:06.784
That makes you feel insignificant.

22:08.578 --> 22:12.040
How does one make it from
the orange groves to the laboratory?

22:13.541 --> 22:15.251
It started here, actually.

22:17.503 --> 22:21.215
I took a second job at the observatory
scrubbing floors at night.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.010
Saved enough there to
get myself a degree.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.847
But it was the war that gave me
a real opportunity.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.724
Navy engineer.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.643
And then some real,
actual scientific work

22:32.727 --> 22:34.020
in the weapons propulsion lab.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.105
Seems to have paid off.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.151
I applied to 16 companies
when I got home.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.653
Isodyne was the only one
that was willing

22:42.737 --> 22:47.325
to put one of my kind in a lab.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.202
So you can see why
I didn't immediately jump

22:49.285 --> 22:50.995
at torpedoing my relationship with them.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.957
You're a good man, Dr Wilkes,
but protecting Isodyne

22:55.041 --> 22:57.919
betrays everything you've fought
so hard to achieve.

22:59.504 --> 23:00.713
I know.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.846
At least I'll still have this view.

23:10.223 --> 23:14.352
Makes the rest of it
a little more bearable.

23:14.435 --> 23:17.271
I've quite enjoyed myself this evening,

23:17.355 --> 23:19.273
but if you've brought me all the way
up here for a view,

23:19.357 --> 23:21.943
then I'm going to be very cross.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.198
Sadly, this lovely view

23:27.824 --> 23:30.118
is not the only thing I have to show you,
Agent Carter.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.250
During the war, Isodyne,

23:37.333 --> 23:39.585
along with every other
legitimate company in their field,

23:39.669 --> 23:41.462
was working towards
a successful atomic reaction.

23:41.546 --> 23:44.549
It was a scientific gold rush.

23:44.632 --> 23:47.969
Now, Isodyne didn't build
Fat Man or Little Boy,

23:48.052 --> 23:49.804
but their research got far enough

23:49.887 --> 23:52.223
to continue atomic testing
after the war ended.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.559
I assume you've seen
an atomic test before.

23:54.642 --> 23:55.768
Remember what happens?

23:55.852 --> 23:58.062
A blinding light followed by
a mushroom cloud

23:58.146 --> 24:00.273
followed by total devastation.

24:00.398 --> 24:01.816
This one didn't go as planned.

24:09.657 --> 24:10.992
What happened?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.410
I wish I could tell you.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.996
Isodyne has worked its people
around the clock,

24:15.079 --> 24:18.124
trying to determine the exact science
behind this anomaly,

24:18.207 --> 24:21.002
but... Well, here.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.171
See for yourself.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.138
What on Earth could do that?

24:32.221 --> 24:33.306
Watch.

24:42.857 --> 24:47.028
No sign of the men or the vehicles
since that moment.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.697
Only one thing was left behind.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.659
Isodyne is calling it "Zero Matter",

24:53.743 --> 24:56.496
mostly because there's no fit for it
anywhere on the periodic table.

24:58.498 --> 25:02.627
Zero Matter is unlike any substance
that we have ever seen.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.671
I'm starting to think that it's
more dangerous

25:05.755 --> 25:07.256
than anything we've ever known.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.095
Move.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.648
So, what is it?

25:24.607 --> 25:26.025
I have a hypothesis.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.693
Do you know what a "perfect fluid" is?

25:27.777 --> 25:30.404
Are you talking about Zero Matter
or your winemaking machine?

25:32.448 --> 25:36.077
Real fluids conduct heat
and have viscosity.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.789
Perfect fluids have no sheer stresses,
no heat conduction.

25:39.872 --> 25:44.961
You see, Zero Matter is always
drawing energy into itself.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.088
It'll always be the coldest object
in the room

25:47.171 --> 25:49.382
because it is literally devouring
any nearby energy.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.467
And that's what killed Jane Scott?

25:51.551 --> 25:54.011
She must've made physical contact
with the specimen.

25:54.095 --> 25:56.055
What exactly was your involvement?

25:56.138 --> 26:00.017
My job was to build and maintain
the magnetic containment chamber.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.311
Zero Matter does not want to stay
in one place.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.146
Where do you think it comes from?

26:04.230 --> 26:06.274
Could be extraterrestrial.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.359
Could be extradimensional.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.195
Not of this Earth?

26:11.279 --> 26:13.155
Right now, we don't know.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.491
You said you could contain it.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.994
Could you transport it?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.328
Why?

26:20.162 --> 26:24.500
Because you and I are going to Isodyne
tonight to steal it.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.587
They're in here somewhere.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.131
Fingers on the trigger.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.382
Shoot anything that moves.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.679
We need to find
another way out of here.

26:36.762 --> 26:37.930
Follow me.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.572
- Oh, bloody hell!
- What?

26:54.655 --> 26:56.699
- What are you doing?
- Sending an S.O.S.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.702
Whoa!

27:00.536 --> 27:02.079
Whoa-whoa! Don't move!

27:02.330 --> 27:03.789
I've got you.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.291
Whoa. Whoa!

27:05.374 --> 27:07.084
Oh, you beast!

27:12.590 --> 27:13.799
- Darling?
- Huh?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.844
Come in, please. Right now.

27:16.927 --> 27:19.847
I had that pink atrocity exactly
where I wanted him.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.016
What could possibly be so important?

27:22.099 --> 27:24.769
There's a sock on the doorknob.

27:29.607 --> 27:31.108
Come on. Come on.

27:32.652 --> 27:33.819
Follow me.

27:35.446 --> 27:36.656
Can you shoot?

27:36.739 --> 27:37.865
I was in the Navy, remember?

27:37.948 --> 27:39.408
Cover me while I get this started.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.993
Don't let them get away!

27:51.712 --> 27:52.797
I'm out!

27:54.006 --> 27:55.299
Here.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.181
Get in!

28:02.973 --> 28:04.475
All right, spread out. On me.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.976
Go, go!

28:12.233 --> 28:13.818
Go! Go, get in the car!

28:26.205 --> 28:27.707
- Do you see them?
- No.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.128
It should be easy to lose them
once we're back in the city.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.796
Oh, of course.

28:35.589 --> 28:38.676
Four lights down, there's an alley.
Pull in there and kill the lights.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.663
I'm starting to think I make
a pretty good secret agent.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.082
Not your best hypothesis.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.792
Ow.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.629
A lapel pin?

29:16.839 --> 29:18.257
I've seen this symbol before.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.051
What's it mean?

29:22.011 --> 29:23.429
I'm not sure.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.976
So, what do we do?
Everything's closed.

29:29.059 --> 29:31.061
We keep walking until we find a phone.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.980
Could be a long walk in those heels.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.441
I've performed far more strenuous tasks
in heels.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.029
I like Leo Carrillo.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.239
I'm telling you,
Zuma's got those perfect barrels.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.658
But Malibu has the wind, Violet.
I'm a purist.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.494
Sorry. I'm ready.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.663
You look great.

29:49.747 --> 29:52.041
I thought tonight called for something
more than my nurse's whites.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.377
Who's that clown?

29:56.337 --> 29:58.464
Someone learning a hard lesson
in rejection.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.009
Have a good night, Rose.

30:05.262 --> 30:06.972
Auerbach Theatrical Agency.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.140
Wait.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.142
Mr Auerbach, call for you.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.104
Hello?

30:14.188 --> 30:15.856
<i>Chief Sousa,
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt.</i>

30:15.940 --> 30:18.567
- Jarvis?
- Ah, yes. Edwin Jarvis here.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.444
I've received an S.O.S. signal
from Miss Carter.

30:20.528 --> 30:22.279
Apparently, she's at
the Griffith Observatory,

30:22.363 --> 30:23.823
and I fear she may be in some trouble.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.407
I'll meet you there.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.871
There. Perfect.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.959
- Do you have any change?
- No, not in this dress.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.379
Let's ask inside.

30:44.593 --> 30:47.429
Excuse me, can you make change
for the telephone?

30:49.932 --> 30:52.351
- Miss, you okay?
- She's fine.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.727
We just need to get...

30:53.811 --> 30:56.397
I wasn't talking to you, boy.
I was talking to the lady.

30:57.106 --> 30:59.650
I'm perfectly well.
I just need change for the phone.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.529
You'll have to buy something.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.947
If you think I'm gonna buy something

31:05.030 --> 31:06.824
from some no-good charlatan
in this rathole of a place...

31:06.907 --> 31:08.701
- Okay, okay.
- Then you are seriously...

31:10.286 --> 31:13.455
Hello, operator? Hello? Hello? Oh, God.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.500
The phone isn't working.
That odious swine.

31:16.584 --> 31:19.587
He may be a jerk,
but this éclair ain't half bad.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.258
Next time, we do things my way.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.428
A quick jab to the right eye
will adjust his attitude tremendously.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.263
Won't get us anywhere.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.390
Besides, it's not like
he's a rare specimen.

31:31.473 --> 31:32.892
You gonna punch all of L.A.?

31:32.975 --> 31:34.393
Maybe. I could do with a hobby.

31:34.476 --> 31:37.438
I'd start with the guys with the guns
that just tried to kill us.

31:37.521 --> 31:38.898
Tried to kill you, Dr Wilkes.

31:38.981 --> 31:40.441
That doesn't make me feel better.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.692
Who were they?

31:41.775 --> 31:44.194
I'm betting they're operating
on the orders of Isodyne

31:44.278 --> 31:45.446
to scrub the project.

31:45.529 --> 31:46.906
We need to get to your lab
to retrieve the research

31:46.989 --> 31:48.574
and the Zero Matter
before those men get their hands...

31:48.657 --> 31:49.700
There's a car coming.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.204
Could be the men from the observatory.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.040
- Don't move.
- Definitely not.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.008
Is it them?

32:06.091 --> 32:07.259
What?

32:09.929 --> 32:11.430
Oh...

32:11.513 --> 32:12.723
No.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.559
We're safe, then?

32:16.644 --> 32:18.646
Yes.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.272
For the time being.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.367
I have an idea.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.701
So do I.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.453
We're going to steal that car.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.498
That's, uh...

32:37.581 --> 32:39.625
Yep, that's definitely
what I was thinking.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.965
- You hear from her?
- No. What did you find?

32:46.048 --> 32:48.217
A rather unsettling amount of
bullet casings.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.843
And her car with her tyre slashed.

32:49.927 --> 32:52.680
- And no sign of Peggy?
- Well, apart from the bullet casings.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.306
Well, you don't think that...

33:00.813 --> 33:03.148
I fear Chief Sousa may be
losing his composure.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.192
Oh, he's just worried about Peg.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.486
- As are we all.
- No.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.697
Chief has a special kind of worry
about her.

33:12.116 --> 33:13.409
- Jacobs!
- Yes, sir?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.536
Get to the observatory.
Supervise the crime scene.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.287
I want you checking every blade
of grass for evidence.

33:17.371 --> 33:18.414
On my way.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.540
Baxter, go shake down the Dunbar.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.334
I want a statement from every person
that set foot in that place.

33:22.418 --> 33:23.544
On it.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.005
Rose, get on the horn
with local precincts.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.798
Put out an APB for Jason Wilkes.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.842
I want every badge in this city
looking for him.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.304
Jarvis, you're coming with me.

33:34.388 --> 33:36.807
Excellent. Where are we going?

33:36.890 --> 33:37.933
Isodyne.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.727
- Oh.
- I'm through playing nice.

33:40.978 --> 33:42.855
Looks clear enough,
but we'll have to move fast.

33:50.571 --> 33:51.822
What's that for?

33:51.905 --> 33:53.323
You used all my bullets.

34:01.165 --> 34:02.249
Someone's here.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.500
We've got to move fast.

34:03.584 --> 34:05.335
Get the Zero Matter.
I'll take care of them.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.698
Ma'am, you shouldn't be...

35:17.783 --> 35:19.034
Whitney Frost?

35:19.118 --> 35:20.702
In the flesh.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.496
Wow.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.665
You know, I'm...
I'm a big fan of yours.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.416
Hmm.

35:27.584 --> 35:28.961
What are you doing here?

35:31.171 --> 35:32.548
Excuse me.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.926
You don't have clearance to be here.
What do you think you're doing?

35:36.051 --> 35:37.469
You'll have to sign this.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.475
Get her!

35:53.110 --> 35:55.904
You really shouldn't be here.
It's... It's not safe.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.489
No, it isn't.

35:57.573 --> 36:01.451
In fact, I'm surprised to see you alive,
Dr Wilkes.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.579
Excuse me?

36:03.662 --> 36:06.540
Now, you're going to place
the specimen in that case,

36:06.623 --> 36:08.584
and you're going to give it to me.

36:08.667 --> 36:12.379
Miss Frost, you have no idea
what this stuff is capable of.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.047
Oh, on the contrary,

36:14.131 --> 36:17.593
I am the only person who knows
what it's capable of.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.219
Now hand it over.

36:33.984 --> 36:36.320
Miss Frost, you're making
a terrible mistake.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.614
I can't in good conscience
let you go through with it.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.658
So you're willing to die for this
crisis of conscience?

36:41.742 --> 36:44.411
I'm starting to think that was your plan
for me no matter what.

36:44.912 --> 36:48.582
I'm also starting to think that
you're smart enough

36:48.665 --> 36:51.919
not to shoot me while I'm holding this.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.351
Run.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.530
Dr Wilkes?

37:22.866 --> 37:23.992
Jason?

37:45.264 --> 37:47.808
- Do you see her?
- No.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.227
Don't bother.
There's no way anybody survived that.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.688
Let's pack it up.

38:01.238 --> 38:02.489
Good. Yes, you're here.

38:02.572 --> 38:03.991
Here's the situation.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.535
Dr Wilkes and I entered Isodyne Energy
at approximately 4:30 a.m.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.203
- Carter, I...
- I engaged with four suspects

38:08.287 --> 38:09.955
while Dr Wilkes went in to retrieve
this unregistered...

38:10.038 --> 38:11.540
- Slow down.
- ...highly volatile scientific discovery.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.417
Peggy, stop. Stop.

38:14.376 --> 38:15.460
Are you okay?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.254
Um, yes, I'm fine.

38:17.337 --> 38:18.922
And Dr Wilkes?

38:19.715 --> 38:21.925
He didn't make it. The explosion.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.510
Okay. We're done here.

38:23.593 --> 38:26.096
- How about you get some rest?
- But there's still so much to process.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.890
Peggy. You're going home.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.642
Okay?

38:39.192 --> 38:40.360
Miss Carter...

38:41.111 --> 38:43.530
I'm immensely relieved
that you're unharmed.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.451
Mr Jarvis,
can I trouble you for a ride home?

38:47.534 --> 38:48.952
Of course.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.272
Is everything okay?

39:17.356 --> 39:18.482
Yes.

39:18.565 --> 39:22.944
Well, no, not entirely, but I'm fine,
Peggy's fine.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.072
I just...

39:26.323 --> 39:27.949
I'm just real tired.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.952
Poor thing. I was worried.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.288
I'm so sorry about last night.
I feel awful.

39:33.372 --> 39:36.166
- It's all right.
- Yeah, I know, but still.

39:36.249 --> 39:39.795
My boyfriend catches bad guys,
and I'm very proud of him.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.755
I just like knowing you're safe.

39:41.838 --> 39:44.758
I am, and I'm gonna make it up to you.

39:44.841 --> 39:45.967
I promise.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.427
I know you are.

39:48.387 --> 39:51.890
I figured it was a long night,
so I brought you a bear claw.

39:51.973 --> 39:54.768
Well, now it's half a bear claw.
'Cause I got hungry.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.728
Why don't you keep that safe for me?

39:59.940 --> 40:01.733
You should hit the hay.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.819
Call me when you finish work.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.114
Maybe we can catch a movie,
make up for lost time?

40:07.197 --> 40:08.698
Will do.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.082
I love you, Daniel.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.793
I love you, too.

40:47.404 --> 40:48.989
Edwin suggested tea,

40:49.072 --> 40:51.616
but I thought whisky was more
the order of the day.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.244
- Bless you.
- Mmm.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.125
Strange that it should hit me so hard.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.628
I don't think it's strange at all.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.756
I'd only known him a few days.

41:08.758 --> 41:13.013
Edwin only knew me a few weeks
before he had forged papers,

41:13.096 --> 41:15.807
gone AWOL, stolen a plane,

41:15.891 --> 41:17.559
and helped me escape the Third Reich.

41:17.976 --> 41:21.730
Doesn't take long to realise
you met someone special.

41:23.607 --> 41:28.278
I just wish I'd had the chance
to get to know him better.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.450
