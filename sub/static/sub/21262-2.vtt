WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:02.234
So, for the brunch on Sunday.

00:02.235 --> 00:06.005
It's going to be you guys, a few
aunts and uncles, your dad,

00:06.007 --> 00:07.840
- your brother...
- You invited Dad?

00:07.842 --> 00:10.576
Yeah, I was chatting with him
on the phone the other day.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.878
It just seemed weird not to include him.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.279
Why would it be weird now?

00:14.281 --> 00:15.714
You've been divorced for over 30 years.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.883
- Well, he just broke up with Padma...
- Right, right, right.

00:17.923 --> 00:20.386
So honestly I think
he's a little lonely.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.155
What does your current husband
Leon think about all that?

00:23.157 --> 00:25.257
Oh, Leon's not gonna care.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.159
Leon might care.

00:29.364 --> 00:30.496
Jesus!

00:30.498 --> 00:31.731
What the [bleep]?

00:31.733 --> 00:33.366
What is happening?

00:33.368 --> 00:34.800
Is that...

00:34.802 --> 00:36.869
Is that guy stealing chicken?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.404
I don't know... they seem
to have it handled.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.124
- Really?
- Um, do you think for the brunch

00:40.165 --> 00:42.008
- 11 or 11:30?
- Mom, do you not see what's happening?

00:42.010 --> 00:43.609
Oh, it's not that big a deal.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.411
Okay, you know what, there's
a man who just apparently

00:45.413 --> 00:48.714
just stole a hot, oily
roast chicken, who was jumped on

00:48.716 --> 00:52.018
from behind and then thrown
forcibly onto the concrete.

00:52.020 --> 00:55.287
I think I'm allowed to comment on it.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.323
Here we go.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.025
"Here we go"?

00:59.027 --> 01:00.226
Seriously?

01:03.131 --> 01:08.131

01:19.180 --> 01:22.848
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

01:22.850 --> 01:25.718
Is that woman just ignoring
that poor blind guy?

01:25.720 --> 01:26.886
People are garbage.

01:26.888 --> 01:28.621
Excuse me.

01:28.623 --> 01:30.523
She's a garbage person.

01:30.525 --> 01:33.693
I don't know if you heard me,
I'm looking for the bathroom.

01:33.695 --> 01:35.661
Hi, you know what?

01:35.663 --> 01:37.329
- I can help you.
- Oh, great.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.533
- Do you want me to grab your arm?
- Yes, thank you very much.

01:40.535 --> 01:44.070
Of course, it's not a problem at all.

01:47.790 --> 01:48.790
Well, well, well.

01:48.794 --> 01:50.242
You must feel pretty
good about yourself.

01:50.244 --> 01:53.012
Oh, you mean because I just helped
a blind man find a bathroom?

01:53.014 --> 01:55.347
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.249
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.552
We'll just have two
lattes and you got, like,

01:59.554 --> 02:00.619
a blueberry muffin?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.755
Yeah. Great. Nine dollars...

02:02.757 --> 02:04.156
- There you go.
- Thank you.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.892
- Actually, this is for you, Amy.
- Thank you.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.562
- Buy yourself something nice.
- You're welcome.

02:09.564 --> 02:10.795
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Amy.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.398
So that's what we're doing now?

02:12.400 --> 02:16.168
We're taking my $11 basically
to pay her for flirting with you?

02:16.245 --> 02:19.146
- It's like prostitution.
- Hey, if it ain't broke, right?

02:19.148 --> 02:20.480
Oh, prostitution is not broke?

02:20.482 --> 02:22.482
No, it's centuries old, millennia, even.

02:22.484 --> 02:24.985
Just because something's old
does not mean it's not broken.

02:24.987 --> 02:27.622
I don't know, do you have a way
of fixing prostitution? Pitch it to me.

02:27.627 --> 02:29.690
You know what, at least you're
not looking to land a lady,

02:29.692 --> 02:31.792
- so we're good.
- Yes, I am.

02:31.794 --> 02:33.760
I'm not talking about
having sex with a lady,

02:33.762 --> 02:36.296
I'm talking about, like,
you know, settle down with one.

02:36.298 --> 02:38.283
People may bang
aggressive toe exposure,

02:38.285 --> 02:39.833
but they're not
gonna marry it.

02:39.835 --> 02:42.402
You know I want to meet someone
and fall in love and have kids...

02:42.404 --> 02:44.905
all of that stuff.
I've told you that before.

02:44.907 --> 02:46.607
I, I know that you say that,

02:46.609 --> 02:48.508
but I feel like all of
your choices in life

02:48.510 --> 02:50.511
- fight against that goal.
- Like what?

02:50.592 --> 02:53.013
You sleep until noon almost every day.

02:53.015 --> 02:54.481
You cut up hot dogs
and put them on your salad.

02:54.483 --> 02:55.849
It's a protein.

02:55.851 --> 02:57.284
How's that any different
than putting chicken

02:57.286 --> 02:58.585
or salmon on your salad?

02:58.587 --> 03:00.387
- It's so different!
- It's paleo!

03:00.389 --> 03:03.590
Well, you recognize porn
strictly from the audio track.

03:03.592 --> 03:05.559
Yeah, that's not rare,
plenty of people can do that.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.461
These are just a couple of
examples of the things

03:07.463 --> 03:09.896
that maybe were cute
and quirky in your 20's,

03:09.898 --> 03:12.532
but now are more red flags.

03:12.534 --> 03:14.234
I respectfully disagree.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.702
People find it charming.

03:15.704 --> 03:18.405
I don't think adult women
find you as charming

03:18.407 --> 03:19.773
as you think they do.

03:19.775 --> 03:22.576
And it pains me to say this, obviously.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.211
I find you very charming.

03:24.213 --> 03:26.480
Oh, well, thank you
for finding me charming.

03:26.482 --> 03:27.648
Who are you looking at?

03:27.650 --> 03:29.249
Oh, just to know who's here.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.618
Look... I know you,
you're a great friend,

03:31.620 --> 03:32.819
you're hilarious, you're cute.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.655
But as a friend, I will tell you

03:34.657 --> 03:38.892
that women have to get through
quite a lot to get to that.

03:38.894 --> 03:42.562
But, worth it, right? Hi-ho!

03:42.564 --> 03:44.264
Knock-knock, who's there, what?

03:46.935 --> 03:49.136
Basically I'm saying is you're living

03:49.138 --> 03:50.871
"The Shawshank Redemption".

03:50.873 --> 03:54.107
But the reality is most people
don't want to crawl through

03:54.109 --> 03:56.310
a tunnel of shit to get to Mexico.

03:56.312 --> 03:57.811
What does that even mean?

03:57.813 --> 04:01.348
Listen, your heart is like Zihuantanejo,

04:01.350 --> 04:04.785
but your personality and exterior

04:04.787 --> 04:07.387
are like the shit tunnel a woman
has to go through to get there.

04:07.389 --> 04:09.690
Wow, okay, that's like,
maybe the meanest thing

04:09.692 --> 04:12.125
- you've ever said to me.
- Oh, that can't be true.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.928
But going with this metaphor,
which is kind of crushing it,

04:14.930 --> 04:17.731
jail, for this woman,
is just regular life.

04:17.733 --> 04:20.233
She's got free will so it's
not nearly as bad for her

04:20.235 --> 04:22.069
as it was for Andy Dufresne, so...

04:22.071 --> 04:23.937
Why? Because she's not being
forced to do tax returns

04:23.939 --> 04:28.175
and getting gang raped
by the sisters in the shower?

04:28.177 --> 04:30.110
Exactly. She can leave at any time.

04:30.112 --> 04:32.179
She can walk out
and just jump on a plane

04:32.181 --> 04:34.348
and go to Cabo instead.

04:34.350 --> 04:36.383
Cabo obviously being any other dude.

04:36.385 --> 04:38.785
Yeah, but everybody
knows Cabo's [bleep] lame,

04:38.787 --> 04:43.423
and Zihuantanejo,
pretty rad all the time.

04:43.425 --> 04:46.593
I'm just not convinced that you're
really ready to settle down.

04:46.595 --> 04:48.261
- Okay, but I'm telling you I am.
- Okay.

04:48.263 --> 04:49.763
I want to meet someone.

04:49.765 --> 04:51.198
Okay, good, but you're
not getting any younger,

04:51.200 --> 04:52.733
your sperm's not getting any younger,

04:52.735 --> 04:54.968
so we got to lock it down
before the "poo tunnel"

04:54.970 --> 04:57.637
gets so long that
nobody can actually survive

04:57.639 --> 04:59.272
the treacherous landscape.

04:59.274 --> 05:00.941
Who's Morgan Freeman in this situation?

05:00.943 --> 05:03.543
I'm Morgan Freeman, I'm leading
you to your happiness

05:03.545 --> 05:06.646
and I just led
a blind man to the bathroom.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.853
The part I can't wrap my head around is

05:12.855 --> 05:16.123
was it an impulse steal
or could he legitimately

05:16.125 --> 05:17.524
not afford to buy a chicken?

05:17.526 --> 05:19.393
My instinct is it's an impulse steal.

05:19.395 --> 05:23.163
Right? Me too, I mean,
he was wearing a leather jacket.

05:23.165 --> 05:24.698
I won't even splurge
on a leather jacket.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.534
Well, maybe we shouldn't be spending
so much money on chicken.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.202
Maybe we should be
stealing it so we can afford

05:29.204 --> 05:31.605
a sweet leather "J".

05:31.607 --> 05:33.907
Hey, do we know any single ladies?

05:33.909 --> 05:35.208
She says apropos of nothing.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.812
- Sorry... any ladies for Kyle?
- Ladies of the night?

05:38.814 --> 05:44.851
No, I mean, I had a very interesting
h-to-h with him today.

05:44.853 --> 05:46.353
Heart-to-heart.

05:46.355 --> 05:49.189
I think he's actually
ready to meet someone of note.

05:49.191 --> 05:50.357
Really?

05:50.359 --> 05:51.892
- Kyle.
- I get the skepticism.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.628
I told him I love him,
but he's getting weird

05:54.630 --> 05:58.064
and I worry about
his little crusty sperm.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.800
I'll come back.

05:59.802 --> 06:04.271
Wait, just... it's not his, it's
a friend's old, crusty sperm.

06:04.273 --> 06:05.572
Does that make it better?

06:05.574 --> 06:08.775
Now she can't put a face to the sperm.

06:08.777 --> 06:11.678
Okay, do we know any single people?

06:11.680 --> 06:13.613
What about Shelly?

06:14.039 --> 06:16.883
- Who's Shelly?
- Miss Shelly, Amelia's teacher.

06:16.885 --> 06:18.385
I never thought of her as a "Shelly".

06:18.387 --> 06:19.883
I know it's a bold choice, but I thought

06:19.885 --> 06:21.421
that I really think this could work.

06:21.423 --> 06:25.492
She's super cute and she's really nice,
but not boring nice.

06:25.494 --> 06:29.529
She's got a good sense of humor
and her body is <i> tight!</i>

06:29.531 --> 06:31.031
Please don't ever do that again.

06:31.033 --> 06:33.233
- <i>Tight!</i>
- Are you done?

06:33.235 --> 06:35.035
<i>Tight.</i>

06:35.037 --> 06:36.636
- She's, like an...
- <i>Tight.</i>

06:36.638 --> 06:39.639
...angel from heaven above.
I hear you, I mean,

06:39.641 --> 06:43.109
especially with Kyle's
crazy-long "shit tunnel".

06:43.111 --> 06:45.545
We might need to get the check.

06:45.547 --> 06:47.047
Listen, if he's really
ready to meet someone,

06:47.049 --> 06:50.183
we should introduce him
to someone we really like.

06:50.185 --> 06:51.451
Okay, we'll give it a try.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.387
All right, I'll put the feelers out.

06:54.389 --> 06:55.989
Wouldn't those be my feelers?

06:55.991 --> 06:59.626
These would be your feelers,
because you like to touch balls.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.928
- Just yours.
- Yeah, they appreciate the attention,

07:01.930 --> 07:05.765
and also, maybe use
a little bit more thumb.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.467
You know what,
the more I think about it...

07:07.469 --> 07:09.169
- What?
- I think it was planned.

07:09.171 --> 07:13.039
Eighty degrees out today...
why wear a leather jacket?

07:13.742 --> 07:16.209
I have never been more attracted to you.

07:24.119 --> 07:26.453
- Hey, honey.
- Dad! Hi!

07:26.455 --> 07:29.356
- How are you?
- I'm good. You look so nice.

07:29.358 --> 07:33.159
Oh, thank you.
Are you riding your motorcycle again?

07:33.161 --> 07:36.463
- I've always ridden a motorcycle.
- No, you've always had a motorcycle.

07:36.465 --> 07:38.365
But most of its life
it's been spending time

07:38.367 --> 07:40.066
with the NordicTrack in your garage.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.434
They're very close.

07:41.436 --> 07:44.870
- No, it hasn't been that long.
- Oh, yeah, it has.

07:44.943 --> 07:48.679
And I wanted to tell you,
I heard that you and Padma broke up.

07:48.681 --> 07:50.547
I'm sure this has
absolutely nothing to do

07:50.549 --> 07:52.449
with you deciding to get
on a motorcycle again,

07:52.451 --> 07:54.685
but I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

07:54.687 --> 07:56.219
- Padma.
- Mm-hmm.

07:56.221 --> 07:58.355
Do you want to put your
helmet down, stay a while?

07:58.357 --> 08:02.359
- I don't see anyplace to put it.
- Literally any flat surface.

08:02.361 --> 08:03.894
I'll just hang onto it, I'd feel better.

08:03.896 --> 08:06.997
Mm-hmm. Dad, you think you look
pretty cool holding that?

08:06.999 --> 08:08.865
- Uh, I've been told.
- Okay, great.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.300
Where's your mother?

08:10.302 --> 08:12.136
Uh, she's in the kitchen
with Leon, I think.

08:12.212 --> 08:13.712
- Okay.
- All right.

08:13.749 --> 08:14.581
- Oh, hi, Martin.
- Hey.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.082
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

08:16.084 --> 08:17.084
He's riding the motorcycle again?

08:17.085 --> 08:18.552
- Yeah.
- Sorry about that.

08:18.554 --> 08:19.753
Well, the good news is
in a couple of months,

08:19.755 --> 08:21.555
when he runs himself off the road,

08:21.557 --> 08:23.557
we'll at least get
the vacation home we wanted.

08:23.559 --> 08:25.492
You know, when parents die
they leave you money.

08:25.494 --> 08:27.360
- Oh, right.
- I don't know if it's gonna be a home.

08:27.362 --> 08:29.930
It might be like a vacation couch.

08:29.932 --> 08:31.431
That would be nice, right?

08:31.433 --> 08:33.232
We'll get the motorcycle.

08:33.235 --> 08:34.967
- [Bleep] you.
- That'd be fun.

08:38.373 --> 08:40.207
If Tilda Swinton is in it, I'm there.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.908
How's it feel to throw out a sentence

08:41.909 --> 08:44.578
that's never been uttered
by another human being before?

08:44.580 --> 08:46.346
You know what's an underrated movie?

08:46.348 --> 08:47.914
- "Coneheads".
- "Coneheads".

08:47.916 --> 08:49.382
Oh, yes, that's right.

08:49.384 --> 08:51.451
You mentioned that before,
Uncle Richard, yet again.

08:51.453 --> 08:54.087
But just listen... the reason
why Tilda is so great...

08:54.089 --> 08:55.922
"Tilda"? First name base?

08:55.924 --> 08:58.291
You never actually really
know if it's her in the movie or not.

08:58.293 --> 08:59.860
So how do you even know
you're enjoying her?

08:59.862 --> 09:03.163
I'm enjoying an actor
losing herself into a character.

09:03.165 --> 09:04.531
- I mean, look...
- "Lose"?

09:04.533 --> 09:06.407
"Grand Budapest Hotel," "Trainwreck"...

09:06.409 --> 09:08.235
I mean, she completely unrecognizable.

09:08.237 --> 09:11.071
Wait a minute... am I in love
with Tilda Swinton?

09:11.073 --> 09:12.539
Is Tilda Swinton at this brunch?

09:12.541 --> 09:15.408
David, am I Tilda Swinton? Be honest.

09:15.410 --> 09:18.177
You can tell me, don't keep it
a secret any longer.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.613
You're the only person
who I know is not Tilda Swinton.

09:20.634 --> 09:24.116
- How dare you.
- She could be Amelia, she's so good.

09:24.174 --> 09:25.674
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:25.676 --> 09:28.677
Tilda Swinton maybe
came out of my <i>vagines?</i>

09:28.705 --> 09:33.657
Um... is my dad touching
our mother right now?

09:33.725 --> 09:36.126
Technically, when one
body part presses up

09:36.128 --> 09:37.828
against another body part,
that is considered touching.

09:37.830 --> 09:39.696
Is it that hard to just say yes or no?

09:39.698 --> 09:43.200
Are they touching?

09:43.202 --> 09:45.502
Yes.

09:45.504 --> 09:46.837
Oh, sure, hey, you want to sit here?

09:46.839 --> 09:48.171
Oh, no, no, I'm fine, Michael.

09:48.173 --> 09:51.508
- How about right here?
- Oh, stop it, Martin.

09:51.510 --> 09:53.610
Actually, Amelia, you can sit with me,

09:53.612 --> 09:54.911
I'll sit next to Grampy.

09:54.913 --> 09:56.713
Grammy can just sit over here.

09:56.715 --> 09:58.481
Oh, thank you, that's nice.

09:58.483 --> 10:00.483
Well, I was gonna switch...

10:00.485 --> 10:03.453
Ooh, you know what, why don't
you go find your cousin, Bugsy?

10:03.455 --> 10:06.690
I want you to try something
because it is absolutely amazing.

10:06.692 --> 10:08.792
Dad, she made it, she knows
what it tastes like.

10:08.794 --> 10:11.595
But this is a very special bite.

10:11.597 --> 10:12.996
Okay.

10:15.734 --> 10:17.434
That was good.

10:17.436 --> 10:19.202
Well, now, Mom, you're bragging.

10:19.204 --> 10:21.638
Shar, we ran out of bagels.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.807
Oh, come on. You ran out of bagels?

10:23.809 --> 10:26.142
You ran out of bagels?

10:26.144 --> 10:28.144
Uncle Richard had an extra half.

10:28.146 --> 10:30.947
Leon, this is what happens when
you buy one bagel per person.

10:30.949 --> 10:32.549
It should be more than enough.

10:32.551 --> 10:35.051
I probably have some wheat bread
or something I can put out,

10:35.053 --> 10:40.523
I don't know. This is ridiculous.
Why can't you just buy enough bagels?

10:40.525 --> 10:43.460
Does Leon look sick to you?

10:43.462 --> 10:45.228
- No, why?
- No reason.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.066
Oh, hey, good news...

10:50.068 --> 10:52.869
my dad apparently wants to make
love with my mom again, so...

10:52.871 --> 10:55.238
- I thought your mom was married.
- Yeah, happily.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.275
I think my dad is just
hoping Leon is close to death.

10:58.277 --> 10:59.609
- Is Leon sick?
- Nope.

10:59.611 --> 11:01.144
This is just my dad's new move.

11:01.146 --> 11:03.380
He, like, harmlessly
flirts with a woman,

11:03.382 --> 11:06.850
then he circles the wagons,
waits until there's a moment of need...

11:06.852 --> 11:09.819
in this case, Leon's
untimely death... and then...

11:09.821 --> 11:11.488
there's Martin.

11:11.490 --> 11:14.190
So smart, he's gonna get such puss.

11:14.192 --> 11:15.825
- Yeah, my mom's puss?
- Yeah.

11:15.827 --> 11:18.361
You know what, my parents
are doing weird shit too.

11:18.363 --> 11:20.797
Like, my dad has started
racecar driving.

11:20.799 --> 11:23.566
- Oh.
- But then he has macular degeneration.

11:23.568 --> 11:25.902
That dude's dying ASAP.

11:25.904 --> 11:27.971
Speaking of decrepit
old men who are close to death,

11:27.973 --> 11:30.040
how did your date with Miss Shelly go?

11:30.042 --> 11:32.108
I assume by your silence
it means you shit the bed.

11:32.110 --> 11:34.411
No, the opposite.
It was great, we had a great time.

11:34.413 --> 11:36.346
- Really?
- Yeah, I really like her.

11:36.348 --> 11:38.448
Ah, well, well, well.

11:38.450 --> 11:39.492
You know, I don't know why, I had a

11:39.494 --> 11:40.650
feeling you guys were gonna hit it off.

11:40.652 --> 11:42.385
I think I just, I just know people.

11:42.387 --> 11:45.055
Really? Because people here
do not like what you're doing.

11:45.057 --> 11:47.424
You didn't do anything to destroy
our daughter's future, did you?

11:47.426 --> 11:49.726
That's a valid question, actually,
I'd like to hear the answer.

11:49.728 --> 11:51.628
- No, we had a great night.
- Hey.

11:51.630 --> 11:54.030
Yeah, we went out to dinner,
we had drinks.

11:54.032 --> 11:55.999
She invited me back to her place.

11:56.001 --> 11:58.301
She asked me to put ice cubes
up her butt and lick them out.

11:58.303 --> 12:01.404
I drove home, I'm gonna
see her again next weekend.

12:01.406 --> 12:03.707
Sorry... what?

12:03.709 --> 12:05.675
- Hmm?
- Yeah, I'm gonna need you

12:05.677 --> 12:07.277
to just walk me through the

12:07.279 --> 12:10.580
"She asked me to put ice cubes
up her butt" part again.

12:10.582 --> 12:14.184
Oh... I thought I just did.

12:14.186 --> 12:16.152
How is it that we always end up talking

12:16.154 --> 12:17.921
about buttholes at this poker game?

12:17.923 --> 12:20.190
Because we have the best poker game.

12:20.192 --> 12:21.458
I have to be honest.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.626
I really like Miss Shelly.

12:23.628 --> 12:25.495
- She's smart, she's funny.
- Right, yes!

12:25.497 --> 12:27.263
She's cool.

12:27.265 --> 12:30.133
I guess the only weird thing is
she ordered a six dollar bottle

12:30.135 --> 12:33.003
of water to drink at dinner,
but was perfectly fine

12:33.005 --> 12:35.305
with the ice cubes I drank
out of her ass being tap.

12:35.307 --> 12:36.706
"Ass cubes".

12:36.708 --> 12:38.942
- No.
- Yeah, ass cubes, it's a solid...

12:38.944 --> 12:41.511
- It's definitely ass cubes.
- How can you make jokes about this?

12:41.513 --> 12:42.879
This woman, we have to
trust her judgment

12:42.881 --> 12:44.447
with our daughter every day.

12:44.449 --> 12:46.983
How are you going to do drop-off
and watch Amelia walk into

12:46.985 --> 12:49.753
the arms of this woman,
knowing what we know?

12:49.755 --> 12:52.889
- Mike, come on.
- This guy ate ice out of her butt.

12:52.891 --> 12:54.524
So just because someone
put ice up their butt

12:54.526 --> 12:56.092
you don't trust their judgement?

12:56.094 --> 12:59.461
We have to assume she's been
putting ice up her butt for years

12:59.477 --> 13:01.631
and she's been a great teacher,
she's not going to change that now.

13:01.633 --> 13:03.099
If you're young and hot
and you live in LA,

13:03.101 --> 13:05.601
you're shoving ice up your butt or more.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.267
Come on.

13:06.269 --> 13:08.702
I genuinely don't
have a problem with it.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.170
Neither do I.

13:10.172 --> 13:11.639
I mean, if I'm really
going to be honest,

13:11.641 --> 13:13.907
I think I'm a little jealous
of Miss Shelly.

13:13.909 --> 13:16.977
- What?
- At 25 she knew to even ask

13:16.979 --> 13:18.512
to put ice up her butt.

13:18.514 --> 13:21.849
- When I was 25...
- No, she didn't ask, she ordered.

13:21.851 --> 13:25.452
See? I mean, I'm a grown woman,
and I don't even know

13:25.454 --> 13:28.389
if I like ice up my butt.
How sad is that?

13:28.391 --> 13:30.557
Do you... want to try that?

13:30.559 --> 13:32.259
I'd like to know the answer
to that as well.

13:32.261 --> 13:33.961
I want to be the person
who says yes, but no,

13:33.963 --> 13:35.729
I don't like a chill.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.265
Mike, I can tell you're nervous,
but you don't need to be.

13:38.267 --> 13:40.601
Like, I'm very into
this girl, but seriously.

13:40.603 --> 13:43.270
This is the most I've ever
heard you say that before.

13:43.272 --> 13:45.205
By the way, I found you your
dream girl, you're welcome.

13:45.207 --> 13:47.341
You did! I thank you, I truly thank you.

13:47.343 --> 13:49.610
This is... I'm, like,
excited to see her again.

13:49.612 --> 13:51.345
Like, I want to talk to her
again, I want to...

13:51.347 --> 13:55.315
Ooh... have kids with this person.

13:55.317 --> 13:56.684
Wow.

13:56.686 --> 13:57.506
Don't act like you don't want kids,

13:57.508 --> 13:58.311
- you do want kids.
- I'm kidding.

13:58.332 --> 13:59.620
No, no, no, I do...

13:59.622 --> 14:02.322
this is the first person I can genuinely
see myself having kids with.

14:02.324 --> 14:04.358
- Listen, we knew after one date, right?
- Yeah.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.961
I mean, you could be
with Miss Shelly forever.

14:07.963 --> 14:11.165
Can we please just call her Shelly?

14:13.135 --> 14:16.470
Doesn't Daddy usually
drop off on Wednesdays?

14:16.472 --> 14:19.707
Yeah, he just wanted to give
Mommy an extra turn.

14:19.709 --> 14:23.944
I'll meet you over there,
I'm going to drop this off.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.713
Hey...

14:25.715 --> 14:28.582
I don't mean to interrupt, but
I heard the date went very well.

14:28.584 --> 14:31.151
Yeah, uh...

14:31.153 --> 14:34.388
We need to have a really
serious conversation about

14:34.390 --> 14:38.058
what you think of me as a person
that you would set me up with him.

14:38.060 --> 14:39.860
- What?
- He was terrible!

14:39.862 --> 14:41.395
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

14:41.397 --> 14:44.398
He made is sound like you guys
had a really nice night.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.033
I'm kidding!

14:46.035 --> 14:47.701
Oh, my God!

14:47.703 --> 14:49.203
- Okay.
- I'm kidding.

14:49.205 --> 14:51.138
It was great, it was so great.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.006
- We had a wonderful time.
- Good!

14:53.008 --> 14:54.541
He was such a gentleman.

14:54.543 --> 14:56.710
Well, I don't want to
blow his inevitably

14:56.712 --> 14:58.078
not-remotely-cool cover,

14:58.080 --> 15:01.181
but he also said that
he had a very good time.

15:01.183 --> 15:04.017
What did he say?

15:04.019 --> 15:06.787
Oh, um, he didn't even...

15:06.789 --> 15:09.389
you know, I'm not even
remembering as much.

15:09.391 --> 15:14.961
Just that you guys had
gone to dinner and it was fun.

15:16.265 --> 15:17.631
Did he tell you about
the Chinese restaurant?

15:17.633 --> 15:19.533
- No.
- Oh, my gosh, it was amazing.

15:19.535 --> 15:22.069
- It was super authentic.
- Of course it was authentic.

15:22.071 --> 15:24.304
Kyle's such a dick about that stuff.

15:24.306 --> 15:27.007
You know, he insists on
watching all foreign films

15:27.009 --> 15:28.509
not in subtitles.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.444
He does not speak any other language.

15:30.446 --> 15:34.181
Well, he got me to eat duck intestine.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.749
I want to be you when I grow up.

15:35.751 --> 15:38.285
Well, no, that's nothing.
Kyle ate live octopus.

15:38.287 --> 15:43.590
Well, that makes sense.
Kyle will put anything in his mouth.

15:43.592 --> 15:46.627
- Hmm.
- Well, here's the toilet paper rolls

15:46.629 --> 15:48.762
you had asked the class to bring in.

15:48.764 --> 15:51.532
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Sorry we didn't have a ton at home.

15:51.534 --> 15:52.926
Oh, that's fine, I have so many of them.

15:52.942 --> 15:55.002
We go through them
like crazy at my house.

15:55.004 --> 15:56.403
Mm-hmm.

15:58.774 --> 16:01.175
Mom, you don't think
it's alarming that Dad

16:01.177 --> 16:04.411
was aggressively flirting
with you at your brunch?

16:04.413 --> 16:05.612
Oh, he wasn't flirting.

16:05.614 --> 16:08.015
- Uh, yeah, he was.
- Yeah, he was.

16:08.017 --> 16:09.983
- Flirting, really?
- Even Mike saw it.

16:09.985 --> 16:11.518
With me?

16:11.520 --> 16:16.023
Oh, ew, ew, ew, "with me?"
Giggle, giggle, giggle.

16:16.025 --> 16:17.691
Oh, just a little bit.

16:17.693 --> 16:20.427
You know I've known your father
for a very long time.

16:20.429 --> 16:21.995
So have I... I don't flirt with him.

16:21.997 --> 16:24.932
Well, he's one of my oldest
friends, and you know...

16:24.934 --> 16:27.301
Your oldest friend who you
had to take to court

16:27.303 --> 16:29.336
to get his home phone number?

16:29.338 --> 16:30.938
- I don't remember that.
- Ugh.

16:30.940 --> 16:32.406
Anyway, it's good to have options.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.974
"Options"? What does that mean?

16:33.976 --> 16:36.109
Well, Leon's not going
to be around forever, right?

16:36.111 --> 16:40.013
Mom, is Leon ill? Because I feel
like this is coming up a lot.

16:40.015 --> 16:41.181
No, no, he's fine.

16:41.183 --> 16:43.984
Amelia, Grammy's got cookies.

16:43.986 --> 16:45.285
Do you have hugs?

16:45.287 --> 16:47.120
Mom, you sound like a pedophile.

16:47.122 --> 16:48.922
Ready or not, here I come.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.925
And even more like a pedophile.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.528
Wow.

16:54.530 --> 16:57.164
Ooh, mama!

16:57.166 --> 16:59.566
Ooh, ooh, ooh, mama!

16:59.568 --> 17:01.401
Looks like Kyle and
Miss Shelly had another

17:01.403 --> 17:03.403
hootsie-tootsie date.

17:03.405 --> 17:05.271
- No...
- Yeah, I think he's managed

17:05.273 --> 17:07.875
to maybe spruce up his shit tunnel.

17:07.877 --> 17:10.676
I think it's more
like he spruced up hers.

17:10.679 --> 17:12.713
What?

17:12.714 --> 17:14.146
How did I not think that?

17:14.148 --> 17:16.215
That is... I should be
kicked out of comedy.

17:16.218 --> 17:18.919
Oof, that's embarrassing.

17:18.921 --> 17:21.188
If only it was just a joke.

17:21.190 --> 17:22.623
All right, you're
going to have to get over

17:22.625 --> 17:24.290
your anal discrimination
because we're going

17:24.292 --> 17:25.826
on a double date
with them this Saturday.

17:25.828 --> 17:28.194
There's no way.
Why would you even do that?

17:28.196 --> 17:30.297
Because Kyle is one of my best friends

17:30.299 --> 17:33.400
and he's finally found someone
and I want to support him.

17:33.402 --> 17:35.335
I can't sit across
from her for a whole meal.

17:35.337 --> 17:37.137
You can't sit across from
Miss Shelly just because

17:37.139 --> 17:39.239
she throws a couple of
ice cubes up her butt?

17:41.277 --> 17:44.544
So, Miss Shelly,
where are you from originally?

17:44.546 --> 17:46.113
Oh, please, just call me Shelly.

17:46.115 --> 17:47.714
I don't think I can.

17:47.716 --> 17:49.216
We're basically from
the same part of New Jersey.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.651
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

17:50.653 --> 17:54.021
- I didn't know that, seriously?
- Yeah. Exit 9B, exit 13.

17:54.023 --> 17:55.255
Yep, trash, trash.

17:55.257 --> 17:57.524
Oh, I killed a guy at exit 13.

17:57.526 --> 18:00.093
- Oh, boy.
- Just kidding, no, I didn't.

18:00.095 --> 18:04.364
I mean, it was more of a bludgeoning
but eventually he died, so...

18:04.366 --> 18:06.099
- How long have you been here for?
- Are you proud of that?

18:06.101 --> 18:07.935
- Do you like that?
- I think...

18:07.937 --> 18:10.070
You're gonna cover it with, "How
long have you been here for"?

18:10.072 --> 18:11.705
'Cause that was rough.

18:11.707 --> 18:13.206
Listen, it's a workshop.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.375
Ooh, I just realized,
I'm getting a message.

18:15.377 --> 18:16.810
- Your Lyft is here.
- Ooh.

18:16.812 --> 18:18.645
You should just go outside
and get to any car

18:18.647 --> 18:20.681
with a pink moustache
or any car that's a man

18:20.683 --> 18:23.383
with a moustache who's driving.

18:23.385 --> 18:25.652
- Okay, to answer your question.
- Thank you.

18:25.654 --> 18:28.455
I've been here for four years.

18:28.457 --> 18:30.257
I got here, I didn't really have a plan,

18:30.259 --> 18:32.025
I did know jack shit and then...

18:32.027 --> 18:33.760
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

18:33.762 --> 18:35.595
I'm so sorry, you're parents,
I shouldn't have cursed

18:35.597 --> 18:36.630
in front of parents.

18:36.632 --> 18:38.298
Oh, please, I swear constantly.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.701
Oh, yeah, no, Shelly is just
like you except, like,

18:40.703 --> 18:45.372
a much, much, much younger
version of you.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.307
So she also finds you repulsive.

18:47.309 --> 18:49.676
But lucky for him I like repulsive.

18:49.678 --> 18:52.179
Probably happened when my father
was bludgeoned off Exit 13.

18:52.181 --> 18:53.747
- Uh-oh.
- That's a comeback.

18:53.749 --> 18:55.015
- Mm-hmm.
- Appreciate it.

18:55.017 --> 18:56.683
- You know what she did?
- And enjoyed it.

18:56.685 --> 19:01.154
She just made a good joke out of
your bad joke from earlier.

19:01.156 --> 19:03.357
- <i>Foccach?</i>
- Oh, thank you, sir.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.993
Wow, look at you, so chivalrous.

19:05.995 --> 19:07.394
You're like Hugh Jackman.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.062
- Hugh Jackman?
- Yeah. I don't know,

19:09.064 --> 19:11.131
I just think he's probably
very respectful of a woman.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.833
- I can see that.
- Right?

19:12.835 --> 19:15.535
But I think of anything, I'm
actually more like Wolverine.

19:15.537 --> 19:18.005
I was born head to toe covered in hair.

19:18.007 --> 19:19.306
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, I have a picture.

19:19.308 --> 19:21.108
Great. I'm going to the bathroom.

19:21.110 --> 19:23.043
When I get back, I would love
to have those locked and loaded.

19:23.045 --> 19:24.344
I'll come with you,
I'll show you in the bathroom.

19:24.346 --> 19:25.712
Show me in the bathroom.

19:25.714 --> 19:27.214
Okay, well, Mike and I
will just hang out here.

19:27.216 --> 19:29.416
- All right.
- Please hurry back.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.618
We're gonna kill this <i>foccach.</i>

19:31.620 --> 19:33.620
- Don't call it "foccach".
- <i>Foccach!</i>

19:33.622 --> 19:36.323
- Am I right?
- Yeah, you bet.

19:36.325 --> 19:39.593
I'm doing this thing now
where whenever I pee, right,

19:39.595 --> 19:41.828
I make myself stop peeing
right in the middle,

19:41.830 --> 19:45.032
and then I go again,
stop, go again, stop.

19:45.034 --> 19:46.633
Do you ever do that?

19:46.635 --> 19:48.035
Nope.

19:48.037 --> 19:50.637
I mean, but do you think
he got burned by the chicken?

19:50.639 --> 19:51.838
Oh, yeah.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.775
And I have to imagine
there was no way not to.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.576
I mean, I do get the instinct, though.

19:56.578 --> 19:59.112
Once I smuggled out a shrimp
cocktail in my bra.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.415
It was really lumpy, everybody
thought I had breast cancer.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.283
Ooh, I like that move!

20:03.285 --> 20:04.851
You know what, when you're pregnant,

20:04.853 --> 20:07.120
just think of all the stuff
you'll be able to steal.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.955
You could do, like, a whole rack of lamb

20:08.957 --> 20:11.792
and then stick potatoes
in a nursing bra.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.461
I wish, but I'm never
going to be pregnant,

20:14.463 --> 20:16.129
so I guess I'll just
have to keep stealing

20:16.131 --> 20:17.431
the old fashioned way.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.267
I'm not talking about now,
I mean later, when you want a baby.

20:20.269 --> 20:22.002
Oh, no, I never want kids.

20:22.004 --> 20:23.437
What?

20:23.439 --> 20:25.172
I mean, I love kids, don't get me wrong.

20:25.174 --> 20:26.940
I just have always known
I don't want any of my own.

20:26.942 --> 20:29.443
What about, like, adoption or surrogacy?

20:29.445 --> 20:32.279
I get them in eight hour
doses a day, that's enough.

20:32.281 --> 20:36.450
Is there any way
to go around there?

20:36.452 --> 20:38.118
Have you told Kyle yet?

20:38.120 --> 20:41.988
God no... we just started dating,
I'm not going to bring up kids yet.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.724
- That would be crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.396
Really?

20:49.398 --> 20:51.998
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.434
I can't believe now I'm going
to have to break up with a girl

20:54.436 --> 20:56.937
who's gorgeous and smart and funny

20:56.939 --> 20:59.005
and likes things up her butt.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.474
Ass cubes.

21:00.476 --> 21:04.744
But are you...
for sure that you want kids?

21:04.746 --> 21:05.912
Well, of course I do.

21:05.914 --> 21:08.648
I know 100% I want kids,
I want to have a family.

21:08.650 --> 21:13.086
There's only one real silver
lining in any of this, I guess,

21:13.088 --> 21:16.056
and that's this is 100% your fault.

21:16.058 --> 21:19.259
And as a result I can lord this over
you for the rest of our lives,

21:19.261 --> 21:21.595
which is actually
kind of great for me.

21:21.597 --> 21:24.431
Are you saying I gave you a gift
and you should be thanking me?

21:24.433 --> 21:27.400
No, it's like you made me
a meal and then were like,

21:27.402 --> 21:29.636
"Oh, it was poison."

21:29.638 --> 21:32.606
Or like made you a meal
and then was like,

21:32.608 --> 21:36.143
"That meal doesn't want babies."

21:36.145 --> 21:38.445
Seriously, though, are you okay?

21:38.447 --> 21:41.648
I'm bummed, for real,
I was ready to be done.

21:41.650 --> 21:42.983
Come here.

21:42.985 --> 21:44.818
What? No, what are you...
we're in the coffee shop.

21:44.820 --> 21:47.787
- So? Just lean into it.
- Stop. What are you doing?

21:47.789 --> 21:50.190
- Just let me... shh, shh.
- That's not... What are you doing?

21:50.192 --> 21:52.626
- What are you doing?
- Just be quiet, you're making a scene.

21:52.628 --> 21:53.835
- Get off of me.
- Just shhh...

21:53.890 --> 21:55.195
It's like a riptide, you gotta...

21:55.197 --> 21:57.430
Just relax and let
nature take its course.

21:57.432 --> 22:00.233
Let me give you my soothing love.

22:00.235 --> 22:03.069
Ooh, wait a minute, okay,
I'm in, now I get it.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.838
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.707
- No, let me...
- No, I need soothing... What? No!

22:09.178 --> 22:11.077
You know what?

22:11.079 --> 22:13.579
In the beginning I didn't
want that hug, but at the end,

22:13.615 --> 22:14.848
I really needed it.

22:17.259 --> 22:19.452
- <i>Don't be mad.</i>
- Oh, God.

22:19.454 --> 22:21.821
Okay, so your father
picked me up on his motorcycle.

22:21.823 --> 22:23.390
- No, mm-mm.
- <i>Wait...</i>

22:23.392 --> 22:25.392
- That's not the bad part.
- That's not the bad part?

22:25.394 --> 22:27.494
We went to dinner and I assumed
it was just as friends,

22:27.496 --> 22:29.796
but you were right,
he was flirting with me.

22:29.798 --> 22:33.433
Oh, my God, mm-mm, mom, I'm
telling you this cannot happen.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.468
<i>You'll be very happy to know
it's not going to happen.</i>

22:35.470 --> 22:38.939
I realized that I am not
sexually attracted to him.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.808
Okay, I have so many
issues with that statement,

22:41.810 --> 22:44.644
but I'm going to take it because
it serves the greater good.

22:44.646 --> 22:46.780
Okay, but I want you to
feel good about my decision.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.380
There's... I... there's nothing good

22:48.382 --> 22:50.150
that I'm feeling from this conversation.

22:50.152 --> 22:51.539
Of course you never know what'll

22:51.541 --> 22:53.220
happen, you know, I mean in the future.

22:53.222 --> 22:54.421
It's good to have options.

22:54.423 --> 22:56.156
Options for when Leon dies.

22:56.158 --> 22:57.257
Oh, God forbid.

22:57.259 --> 22:58.792
Sharon!

22:58.794 --> 23:00.660
Oh, he's coming, he's coming...

23:00.662 --> 23:02.362
- <i>I got to go, bye.</i>
- Bye.

23:03.899 --> 23:06.299
- Wow!
- What was that about?

23:06.301 --> 23:09.302
Oh, just my mom no longer
finds my dad attractive,

23:09.304 --> 23:11.871
but that can change if Leon dies, so,

23:11.873 --> 23:15.008
basically we're one heartbeat away
from my worst nightmare coming true.

23:15.010 --> 23:17.777
We have to really make sure
that Leon's kept healthy.

23:17.779 --> 23:19.980
I'm already planning
on harvesting my bone marrow,

23:19.982 --> 23:21.714
so I got that in the works.

23:21.771 --> 23:25.340
Mommy, is Grammy and
Grampy getting married?

23:25.342 --> 23:27.942
Not if there's a God.

23:27.944 --> 23:29.477
Is there a God?

23:33.493 --> 23:34.625
Look at you!

23:35.093 --> 23:37.594
Back on campus, I'm proud of you.

23:37.596 --> 23:38.928
I'm not getting the play by play.

23:38.930 --> 23:41.130
I think I can get over her
sexual proclivities.

23:41.132 --> 23:43.666
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
you're still being weird about this.

23:43.668 --> 23:46.002
It's so not a big deal.

23:46.004 --> 23:48.204
Okay, I'll give you a little bit.

23:48.206 --> 23:50.773
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, guys, you're here early today.

23:50.775 --> 23:53.610
Yeah, we have a kindergarten
interview, sorry.

23:53.612 --> 23:55.578
That's fine, they're
just finishing up their snack.

23:55.580 --> 23:57.347
Okay, we can wait. Hi, boo.

23:57.349 --> 23:59.515
- Who wants ice in their juice?
- Me.

23:59.517 --> 24:01.250
All right.

24:01.252 --> 24:02.652
Here you go...

24:05.724 --> 24:07.991
And some ice over here.

24:07.993 --> 24:10.159
No ice! Actually, no juice.

24:10.161 --> 24:11.728
But Mommy, I want juice.

24:11.730 --> 24:13.930
You know what, we're going
to have juice at home.

24:13.932 --> 24:16.032
Actually, you remember the
dentist said we shouldn't have

24:16.034 --> 24:18.534
too much juice, so maybe
we'll just get, we'll get, like,

24:18.536 --> 24:21.270
a soda or something.

24:21.272 --> 24:22.272
You know what?

24:22.273 --> 24:23.406
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:23.408 --> 24:24.974
Guys, enjoy your snacks... sorry again.

24:24.976 --> 24:27.190
All right, have a good one.
Bye.

24:27.345 --> 24:29.731
Who else wanted ice?
Okay.

24:29.733 --> 24:31.133
