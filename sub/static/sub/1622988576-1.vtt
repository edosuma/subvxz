00:49.086 --> 00:51.253
(sighing)

03:21.544 --> 03:22.377
- Thanks.

03:26.947 --> 03:29.190
- What the hell is she doing fishing?

03:29.190 --> 03:31.050
- It's okay.

03:31.050 --> 03:32.063
Leave her alone.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.300
- It's your daughter.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.153
Let's go!

04:04.177 --> 04:05.360
- [George] Mornin'.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.160
- [Tom] Mornin', George.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.093
- Hey, I wanted to say
sorry again, for your loss.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.850
He was a great man, he was great to me.

04:13.850 --> 04:14.683
- How's Reese?

04:14.683 --> 04:16.440
- He's a good baby, good kid.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.600
Come by and see him, huh?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.750
- Yeah, we oughta get
a beer some time, man.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.803
It's been way too long.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.293
- Let's do that.
- All right.

04:44.657 --> 04:48.269
(baby vocalizing)

04:48.269 --> 04:49.102
- Hey.

04:50.446 --> 04:51.380
Hey.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.774
Oh, you got my hair. (laughs)

04:53.774 --> 04:55.450
- [George] Hey, I got breakfast.

04:55.450 --> 04:56.861
- [Kim] Okay, thank you.

04:56.861 --> 04:57.916
(laughing)

04:57.916 --> 04:59.250
You're so silly.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.460
- [George] You sure you
don't want me to take you?

05:00.460 --> 05:03.745
- No, Dad, no special treatment, okay?

05:03.745 --> 05:06.960
(shouting playfully)

05:06.960 --> 05:08.670
I left a list on the fridge with

05:08.670 --> 05:10.891
feeding times and nap times.

05:10.891 --> 05:13.203
- Hey, hey, I raised two kids.

05:14.037 --> 05:16.046
We got this, right?

05:16.046 --> 05:17.610
We got this.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.495
- Bye, time for Mommy to go.

05:19.495 --> 05:24.495
Bye, I love you. (laughs)

06:14.959 --> 06:17.209
(grunting)

06:26.977 --> 06:28.549
- Combine's clean.

06:28.549 --> 06:30.542
- (sighs) I'll be in my studio.

06:30.542 --> 06:33.060
- Aub, can you pick me up some new gloves?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.460
- Yeah, they're on the list.

06:35.700 --> 06:36.533
- Thanks.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.280
- You stink.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.630
Did you sweep up the chaff?

06:43.220 --> 06:44.053
- No.

06:45.610 --> 06:47.390
I'll do it in the morning.

06:47.390 --> 06:50.290
- All we need is for someone
to slip and break their neck.

06:59.147 --> 07:00.998
You see the paper?

07:00.998 --> 07:02.143
- No, why?

07:03.360 --> 07:04.830
- Our greedy township supervisors

07:04.830 --> 07:07.283
have started issuing drilling permits.

07:26.850 --> 07:27.683
- Hey, Jill.

07:28.770 --> 07:31.290
We need a little help
with these hospital bills.

07:31.290 --> 07:33.883
Yes, we, me and Kim, your daughter.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.670
Well, the garage has just
been, will you let me talk?

07:38.670 --> 07:40.950
- Why do you even bother calling her, Dad?

07:40.950 --> 07:43.460
- [George] Okay, the garage
has been a little bit slow.

07:43.460 --> 07:44.293
No.

07:44.293 --> 07:45.580
- She doesn't give a shit.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.120
- Right, yeah, no, of course not.

07:48.120 --> 07:48.953
'Cause we all just can't get up

07:48.953 --> 07:52.208
and leave whenever we
fucking want, can we, Jill?

07:52.208 --> 07:55.041
(baby vocalizing)

08:55.970 --> 08:58.137
(sighing)

09:25.780 --> 09:27.570
- Okay, so that's five.

09:27.570 --> 09:28.550
Here ya go.

09:28.550 --> 09:29.520
- Okay.
- Thank you.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.710
Have a great day.

09:30.710 --> 09:31.543
- Thank you.

09:38.540 --> 09:39.560
- Hey, George.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.700
- Hey.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.211
I got you all finished up.

09:42.211 --> 09:43.142
Here.

09:43.142 --> 09:44.659
You know what, if you wanna pay cash

09:44.659 --> 09:47.040
I'll knock another 10% off that.

09:47.040 --> 09:47.873
Yeah.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.590
- George, what the hell?

09:53.720 --> 09:58.280
- Oh, yeah, I noticed that your
rear brakes needed replaced.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.970
- Okay, but you told me $25.

10:00.970 --> 10:02.650
- Well, yeah, for the inspection.

10:02.650 --> 10:04.210
But then I have to do the emissions,

10:04.210 --> 10:05.750
that's 35, that's outta my hands,

10:05.750 --> 10:09.103
and, like I said, your
rear brakes were low.

10:10.730 --> 10:11.563
- Okay.

10:12.870 --> 10:15.000
Low enough to not pass inspection?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.410
- Practically.

10:16.410 --> 10:18.200
Look, I charged you 100 bucks for that,

10:18.200 --> 10:20.340
and that's a big discount,
and I saved you a trip.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.490
You woulda been back here in two months.

10:22.490 --> 10:23.740
- You know what, George?

10:23.740 --> 10:25.163
Just cut the bullshit.

10:26.010 --> 10:29.153
I can do $50 cash, that's it.

10:31.412 --> 10:32.343
- I got a family.

10:33.826 --> 10:35.073
- Take it or leave it.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.330
Or I'm gonna report you.

10:55.818 --> 10:57.985
(sighing)

11:00.930 --> 11:01.763
- Let me try.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.233
- Make sure it's good and tight.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.333
That cover comes loose in the field,

11:13.333 --> 11:14.770
and you're gonna lose another

11:14.770 --> 11:17.330
whole day of work.
- I've done this before.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.253
- Yeah, you have.

11:20.510 --> 11:23.060
Up and down the back 40
all night searching for it.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.184
- [Tom] Fuck!

11:30.830 --> 11:32.650
- Weather reports say
we're not gonna get a break

11:32.650 --> 11:34.223
from this heat any time soon.

11:35.586 --> 11:36.550
(sighs)

11:36.550 --> 11:39.263
God help us if we get another
weak yield this season.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.203
- God ain't gonna do shit, Mom.

11:51.130 --> 11:54.274
I'm telling you, we gotta
go big or we gotta get out.

11:54.274 --> 11:56.560
(Kathryn sighs)

11:56.560 --> 11:59.553
More field corn, maybe even soybeans,

12:00.840 --> 12:02.085
otherwise we're gonna have a For Sale sign

12:02.085 --> 12:03.413
on our field next.

12:03.413 --> 12:04.773
- Don't you dare say that!

12:05.640 --> 12:07.220
If your Daddy heard you say that he'd--

12:07.220 --> 12:09.360
- Dad wouldn't have
driven by George's farm

12:09.360 --> 12:11.163
every day without making an offer.

12:12.220 --> 12:14.870
- Make an offer, with what?

12:14.870 --> 12:16.459
We haven't even recouped our losses

12:16.459 --> 12:19.020
from shuttin' down dairy production.

12:19.020 --> 12:22.550
- Sellin' the cows was
the best idea we ever had!

12:22.550 --> 12:23.903
And it's not enough!

12:27.210 --> 12:29.073
It's still not enough!

12:30.010 --> 12:33.227
- If you spent as much time
workin' as you did bitchin'!

12:42.770 --> 12:44.160
- Wait.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.110
Stay in that light.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.733
- I always wanted to be a model.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.133
Isn't that silly?

12:52.900 --> 12:55.190
I wonder what Joe wanted to be?

12:55.190 --> 12:57.010
- He told me when he
got out of the service

12:57.010 --> 12:59.810
buying this land was the first
thing he and Kathryn did.

13:01.610 --> 13:03.313
I guess farming was in their DNA.

13:08.590 --> 13:10.053
Not so much for others.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.903
- Every family has its problems.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.980
Tom and his folks were really good

13:18.980 --> 13:20.653
to us when we needed it most.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.900
But we're just in a rough patch, is all.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.660
- Mom, I've given a lotta
years of my life to this farm.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.023
I stayed and I took care of Joe.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.520
But you're the one that
married Tom, not me.

14:42.194 --> 14:43.027
Thanks.

15:21.642 --> 15:23.225
- Need a ride home?

16:02.480 --> 16:03.900
- [Heather] Hey, Dad.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.350
- Hey!

16:05.350 --> 16:06.910
About gave me a heart attack.

16:06.910 --> 16:08.100
You gonna stay for the weekend?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.280
- Yeah, I had a friend drop me off.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.550
I wanted to see Reesey.

16:10.550 --> 16:13.000
- Great, glad you're here.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.250
Just grabbed some bagels.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.350
- Gotta catch the bus!

16:18.350 --> 16:20.489
Good thing Heather was
here, where were you?

16:20.489 --> 16:24.630
- I was just up at the garage working.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.660
Here, you wanna grab
a bagel before you go?

16:26.660 --> 16:27.930
Here.

16:27.930 --> 16:29.363
- Say bye to Mama.

16:31.812 --> 16:33.950
- Hey, you want one of these?

16:33.950 --> 16:34.867
- I'm good.

17:12.810 --> 17:14.520
- Hey, Billy, George Lomack callin'.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.369
Hope, uh, hope this finds you guys well.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.313
I was looking through my book,

17:17.313 --> 17:18.990
and I saw that you're a little behind

17:18.990 --> 17:21.630
on your annual auto inspection.

17:21.630 --> 17:22.609
Thought you might wanna get out here

17:22.609 --> 17:23.560
and get somethin' on the books.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.750
So give me a call if you do.

17:24.750 --> 17:25.950
Again, hope you're well.

17:32.490 --> 17:34.340
- [Recording] We're sorry, your call.

17:41.370 --> 17:44.663
- DJ, hey, how you guys doin', huh?

17:45.900 --> 17:49.214
She did, yeah, yeah, she's doin' good.

17:49.214 --> 17:50.864
Oh, he's great, yeah, it's a boy.

17:52.020 --> 17:54.220
Reese. (chuckles)

17:54.220 --> 17:56.289
Yeah, well, hey listen I
was goin' through my book,

17:56.289 --> 17:59.370
and I see that you're about
due for your inspection

17:59.370 --> 18:00.900
so do you want to make an
appointment and get in here,

18:00.900 --> 18:02.250
and get that taken care of?

18:04.550 --> 18:05.483
You did.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.940
Hey, DJ, it's a pretty
big chain, you know.

18:11.940 --> 18:13.390
They're not gonna give
you the personal service

18:13.390 --> 18:14.223
that I would.

18:18.860 --> 18:19.693
Yeah.

18:21.091 --> 18:23.430
All right, well, if that
doesn't work out then...

18:24.720 --> 18:25.553
I'll be here.

18:27.660 --> 18:28.960
All right.

18:28.960 --> 18:29.910
Yep, I'll tell her.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.419
(baby crying)

18:55.660 --> 18:56.577
- I'm home!

18:57.491 --> 18:59.158
Only 175 days to go.

19:01.925 --> 19:03.623
Jesus, Dad, wake up!

19:05.000 --> 19:06.050
What are you doing?

19:06.050 --> 19:07.410
What happened?

19:07.410 --> 19:10.220
- Nothing, nothing, I just
closed my eyes for a second.

19:10.220 --> 19:11.490
- No, it's not nothing, Dad.

19:11.490 --> 19:13.050
Reese could have fallen on the floor

19:13.050 --> 19:14.410
or gotten a hold of something or like--

19:14.410 --> 19:15.780
- He can't even crawl yet, honey.

19:15.780 --> 19:16.960
- Why weren't you watching him?

19:16.960 --> 19:19.060
- I was right in the kitchen.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.323
He didn't do it on purpose, Kim.

19:20.323 --> 19:21.743
- Are you okay?

19:27.130 --> 19:28.340
- Hey, what time is it?

19:28.340 --> 19:29.740
Is it three o'clock already?

19:32.819 --> 19:35.250
- Eddie Drake, Patriot Exploration.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.083
- Thanks for coming out.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.670
- Well, this is a beautiful
property you have here.

19:38.670 --> 19:40.190
I notice your land for sale sign.

19:40.190 --> 19:41.433
Have you had any takers?

19:44.090 --> 19:46.343
We could pay up to $1200 an acre.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.970
Plus a percentage of proceeds

19:48.970 --> 19:51.380
from gas production, of course.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.933
Does that sound like something
you might be interested in?

20:19.030 --> 20:20.197
- Here you go.

20:21.924 --> 20:22.757
Thank you.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.460
- Hello, Ma'am.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.112
Eddie Drake, Patriot Exploration.

20:36.112 --> 20:37.850
- Not interested.

20:37.850 --> 20:39.167
- I'm just lookin' for
a moment of your time

20:39.167 --> 20:41.660
to talk about some
natural gas opportunities.

20:41.660 --> 20:43.140
- Is that right?

20:43.140 --> 20:46.100
Well, I'd like to talk to
you about the opportunities

20:46.100 --> 20:48.520
inside the barrel of my shotgun.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.890
Why don't you stay here?

20:49.890 --> 20:51.510
I'll go get it.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.410
- You have yourself a good day, Ma'am.

20:55.750 --> 20:56.583
- Christina!

21:00.782 --> 21:02.763
I need you to do me a favor.

21:14.020 --> 21:14.853
- [George] Hey.

21:14.853 --> 21:16.247
- Late night? (chuckles)

21:16.247 --> 21:17.410
(gasps)

21:17.410 --> 21:18.243
Heather!

21:19.770 --> 21:20.610
When did you get home?

21:20.610 --> 21:23.876
- Last night.
- Oh.

21:23.876 --> 21:26.141
Well, Kathryn wanted me to invite you guys

21:26.141 --> 21:28.040
over for dinner tonight.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.974
- Oh, that sounds fun, Dad?

21:29.974 --> 21:31.950
- Yeah, of course.

21:31.950 --> 21:33.150
Tell her we'll be there.

21:35.131 --> 21:36.330
- Well, you look good.

21:36.330 --> 21:37.703
Very farmer chic.

21:38.980 --> 21:39.813
- Thanks.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.148
How long you home for?
- Just the weekend.

21:42.148 --> 21:43.800
- Oh, bummer.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.633
- Yeah.

21:44.633 --> 21:46.028
- Okay, well, I'll see you in a bit.

21:46.028 --> 21:47.195
- 'Kay.
- Yeah.

21:57.582 --> 22:00.415
(baby vocalizing)

22:02.303 --> 22:05.220
- You working on that portfolio?

22:05.220 --> 22:07.020
- Not as much as I'd like to lately.

22:08.110 --> 22:09.660
- How's college goin', Heather?

22:10.760 --> 22:11.593
- It's good.

22:12.467 --> 22:14.060
- Oh, come on, tell 'em.

22:14.060 --> 22:16.840
She's doin' great, she's
at the top of her class.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.323
And she just made the softball team.

22:24.780 --> 22:26.693
- How's things with the garage, George?

22:31.070 --> 22:33.000
- Don't see much goin' on over there.

22:33.000 --> 22:33.833
- Kathryn.

22:34.870 --> 22:35.703
You want a beer?

22:35.703 --> 22:36.871
- Yeah, I'm due.

22:41.380 --> 22:44.423
- George, I know you're in a tough spot.

22:46.780 --> 22:49.530
Now that business with your
wife was surely a heart break,

22:49.530 --> 22:54.530
but I gotta tell ya, her leaving
you and the girls the land

22:56.690 --> 23:01.280
that is a blessing, a real opportunity.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.259
- But the longer you wait,

23:03.259 --> 23:04.129
the longer it's gonna take you

23:04.129 --> 23:07.520
to get that earth producin' again.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.210
- We've been outta the farm
business for a long time.

23:10.210 --> 23:11.043
- Well, then.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.820
You could lease me the land.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.610
You know I'll get it back to health.

23:17.610 --> 23:19.150
- How much?

23:19.150 --> 23:21.200
- We'd give you a fair
price for it, George.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.050
- Well, how much?

23:23.530 --> 23:24.523
- 200 an acre.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.890
- Let's take the baby inside.

23:35.720 --> 23:39.523
- George, I know you had a visitor today.

23:41.736 --> 23:44.550
(baby vocalizing)

23:44.550 --> 23:45.900
- Is he havin' a hard time?

23:47.550 --> 23:48.383
May I?

23:49.385 --> 23:50.387
Oh.

23:50.387 --> 23:53.220
(baby vocalizing)

24:09.820 --> 24:10.653
See?

24:11.670 --> 24:12.570
- I just hate pumping.

24:12.570 --> 24:14.965
I mean, I feel like a cow or something.

24:14.965 --> 24:17.560
- Well, you could always give him formula.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.070
- Really, it's safe for him if I switch?

24:20.070 --> 24:21.163
- Absolutely.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.940
If I had it to do over again,
I'd give Christina formula.

24:25.780 --> 24:27.000
There's a lot of things I'd do differently

24:27.000 --> 24:28.730
if I had another one.

24:28.730 --> 24:31.357
Here you go. (tongue clicking)

24:31.357 --> 24:32.933
You know, if you ever need anything

24:32.933 --> 24:34.533
you give me a call, all right?

24:35.426 --> 24:36.933
I was about your age when I had Christina

24:36.933 --> 24:38.800
so I know how hard it can be.

24:38.800 --> 24:39.743
- Thanks, Aubrey.

24:41.820 --> 24:44.453
- So you and his daddy?

24:46.728 --> 24:48.563
- His dad's a teenager.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.560
- You're a teenager.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.560
- Well, not anymore.

24:56.484 --> 25:00.143
Did, um, did Christina ever meet her dad?

25:01.616 --> 25:02.449
- Ngh-ngh.

25:15.230 --> 25:18.320
- I don't think you guys
are seeing the full picture.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.683
Kathryn, look around you.

25:19.683 --> 25:22.970
You got a highway at the
back of your field now.

25:22.970 --> 25:26.113
And where's your dairy
business, and my farm?

25:27.060 --> 25:30.010
The world is leaving us behind.

25:30.010 --> 25:34.147
- But if you make a tree
good, its fruit will be good.

25:34.147 --> 25:37.288
You make a tree bad, its
fruit's gonna be bad.

25:37.288 --> 25:39.500
- We don't need fuckin' fruit.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.583
We need a miracle.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.660
Yeah.

25:44.660 --> 25:45.493
- George!

25:45.493 --> 25:48.131
- Hey, Kathryn, you make the decisions

25:48.131 --> 25:49.563
that's best for your family.

25:51.100 --> 25:53.623
I'll make the decisions
that's best for mine.

26:11.630 --> 26:13.840
Not much goin' off over there.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.673
Really?

26:15.530 --> 26:16.363
Who does she think she is?

26:16.363 --> 26:17.823
- They're just concerned.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.860
To be honest, so am I.

26:20.860 --> 26:22.560
Why didn't you tell me the
garage was going under?

26:22.560 --> 26:24.853
- What do you mean, the
garage isn't going under.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.900
What, are you going
through all my bills now?

26:31.900 --> 26:34.703
- Yeah, 'cause your lying them
on every table in the house.

26:36.610 --> 26:39.160
Okay, this gas company.

26:39.160 --> 26:42.427
What, you said it's a check
at signing for the lease

26:42.427 --> 26:44.000
and then it's royalties?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.470
- As far as I understood.

26:46.470 --> 26:48.500
- Okay, and then we see
what Kathryn can offer.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.220
- Well, she can't offer shit, okay?

26:51.220 --> 26:53.200
It's not exactly the
Garden of Eden over there.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.121
- Okay, Dad, I know you're pissed,

26:54.121 --> 26:56.600
but we have to consider every option.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.100
- They can't help us, Heather.

26:59.140 --> 27:00.437
- Okay, whatever.

27:01.900 --> 27:05.360
We can cut costs over here,
I mean, we don't need cable.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.566
- Fine.

27:06.566 --> 27:08.934
- And we'll turn the lights off.

27:08.934 --> 27:09.767
- Great.

27:09.767 --> 27:12.128
Let's just be Amish now.

27:12.128 --> 27:13.780
- I'm serious, Dad.

27:13.780 --> 27:14.660
You know my school?

27:14.660 --> 27:15.693
- No, no.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.580
- Oh, great, welcome to
the conversation, Kim.

27:20.580 --> 27:22.713
While we're here, we don't need these.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.490
- What, you're not gonna
cancel my phone, are you?

27:26.490 --> 27:27.820
- Jesus!

27:27.820 --> 27:30.170
Kim, you know they're a
fuckin' waste of money.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.206
And that's all you have to say, seriously?

27:32.206 --> 27:34.623
While Dad's drowning
in your medical bills?

27:42.787 --> 27:45.787
(breathing heavily)

28:51.613 --> 28:53.946
(sniffling)

30:41.059 --> 30:43.226
(moaning)

30:53.527 --> 30:55.110
- Oh, don't stop!

30:55.110 --> 30:57.277
(moaning)

31:01.845 --> 31:03.428
- [George] Oh yeah.

31:06.758 --> 31:09.008
(laughing)

31:12.186 --> 31:13.995
(laughing)

31:13.995 --> 31:15.245
- That was fun.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.580
- Did you do some more
submissions this week?

31:27.580 --> 31:29.460
- Mm-hm.

31:29.460 --> 31:30.767
Some in New York.

31:30.767 --> 31:32.017
One in Chicago.

31:33.005 --> 31:35.005
- Where do you wanna go?

31:37.525 --> 31:38.358
- MoMA.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.166
Yancey or Guggenheim.

31:43.261 --> 31:44.678
- Is that Europe?

31:54.991 --> 31:58.658
You told me that when
Joe dies, you'd leave.

32:09.948 --> 32:10.781
When?

32:26.116 --> 32:28.783
(lips smacking)

33:12.347 --> 33:14.597
(grunting)

35:34.020 --> 35:35.090
- Good Lord, that's a lotta food.

35:35.090 --> 35:36.183
- [Vendor] Breakfast of champions.

35:36.183 --> 35:37.016
(laughing)

35:37.016 --> 35:38.230
- Thanks, man, appreciate it.

35:39.110 --> 35:40.503
- [Vendor] What can I get ya?

37:03.790 --> 37:04.823
- Christina!

37:35.218 --> 37:38.051
(baby vocalizing)

37:42.204 --> 37:43.037
- Okay.

37:46.354 --> 37:49.187
(baby vocalizing)

37:52.089 --> 37:52.922
It's okay.

37:54.761 --> 37:58.531
- You're gonna have to go home now, Kim.

37:58.531 --> 38:00.198
- Okay, I got it go.

38:01.281 --> 38:02.448
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:04.005 --> 38:04.960
I got you.
- Bye.

38:04.960 --> 38:05.793
- Okay.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.086
(coughing)

40:52.050 --> 40:54.150
- [Heather] Still forbidden to talk to us?

40:55.667 --> 40:58.093
- [Christina] Of course. (laughs)

41:11.012 --> 41:12.076
Remember when Tom and George used

41:12.076 --> 41:14.160
to bring us out here hunting with them?

41:14.160 --> 41:15.872
(laughing)

41:15.872 --> 41:17.465
- (coughs) Yeah.

41:17.465 --> 41:19.558
You guys are gonna love this.

41:19.558 --> 41:21.423
- Camo'ed up head to toe.

41:22.270 --> 41:24.087
And then you.

41:24.087 --> 41:26.198
- Would fall asleep.
- Like every single time.

41:26.198 --> 41:28.365
- Every single time, yeah.

41:30.202 --> 41:34.490
He used to get so upset when
I didn't see the turkey.

41:36.033 --> 41:37.819
(laughing)

41:37.819 --> 41:42.390
Like as if I didn't see
them every single day

41:42.390 --> 41:43.723
running across the field.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.430
I always loved that shirt.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.113
It's so soft.

41:51.980 --> 41:54.350
- Get your mitts off
my weed pocket, Lomack.

41:59.860 --> 42:01.990
- Tom and Aubrey still come up here?

42:01.990 --> 42:03.290
- No, I highly doubt that.

42:07.450 --> 42:08.866
Ah, no, give me that.

42:08.866 --> 42:09.699
Give me that!

42:09.699 --> 42:11.949
(laughing)

42:15.076 --> 42:16.710
(groaning)

42:16.710 --> 42:19.543
(camera clicking)

42:21.900 --> 42:24.343
You know, I started
submitting to galleries.

42:25.380 --> 42:26.630
- That's great.

42:28.517 --> 42:30.513
I mean, did you hear anything back or?

42:32.560 --> 42:33.910
- Not yet.

42:33.910 --> 42:34.743
- You will.

42:36.170 --> 42:37.003
- How about you?

42:37.946 --> 42:39.620
I can't believe Kim graduated.

42:39.620 --> 42:41.563
- Yeah, thank the maker.

42:43.700 --> 42:44.533
- So?

42:48.982 --> 42:51.240
(sighing)

42:51.240 --> 42:53.740
- I lost my grant and,
yeah, we could never really

42:53.740 --> 42:55.463
afford college anyway so.

42:56.860 --> 42:58.250
- The gas well is not?

42:58.250 --> 43:00.383
- It's helping, it's just,

43:01.270 --> 43:03.310
we were in so much debt after everything

43:03.310 --> 43:05.553
and just kinda crossing fingers

43:05.553 --> 43:07.503
for that first royalty check, you know?

43:09.090 --> 43:11.053
I'm looking into online courses.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.743
But, you know, our
fuckin' internet's shit.

43:17.750 --> 43:21.693
- You are a brilliant,
beautiful badass woman,

43:22.980 --> 43:25.320
and you are gonna figure
this shit out, right?

43:25.320 --> 43:26.829
- Yes.

43:26.829 --> 43:27.662
- Huh?

43:30.788 --> 43:31.621
- Yes.

43:38.693 --> 43:39.603
- Holy shit.

43:40.765 --> 43:45.765
This is good weed. (laughs)

45:02.992 --> 45:05.242
(spitting)

45:13.485 --> 45:14.318
- Fishin'?

45:15.760 --> 45:17.110
I bought us a couple hours.

45:23.677 --> 45:25.927
(coughing)

45:44.440 --> 45:45.508
You know, this never woulda happened

45:45.508 --> 45:47.123
if Joe were still around.

45:48.270 --> 45:49.153
- You know, Kathryn, the
Lomacks didn't really

45:49.153 --> 45:50.423
have a choice.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.590
- There's always a choice.

45:53.760 --> 45:58.500
And pretty soon, your
step-daddy's gonna have a choice.

45:58.500 --> 46:03.500
God knows I love my son, but
when I'm gone, he's gonna sell.

46:07.790 --> 46:09.650
Unless I leave the farm to you.

46:09.650 --> 46:12.120
- What, no, no, Kathryn,
I didn't sign up for that.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.310
- You're a farmer, Christina.

46:13.310 --> 46:15.920
- No, I'm not and I don't wanna be.

46:15.920 --> 46:18.493
- Then what do you wanna
be, a photographer?

46:21.401 --> 46:23.651
(coughing)

46:29.024 --> 46:33.810
(sighs) You know, years ago,
when Joe and I used to travel

46:35.670 --> 46:39.663
we'd go to the bullfights, and
there's a place in the ring,

46:40.670 --> 46:45.563
querencia, it's a place,
of sanctuary for the bull,

46:45.563 --> 46:50.563
where the bull feels safe
and strong and protected.

46:52.020 --> 46:56.630
And you may think your
photographs are separate,

46:56.630 --> 47:00.440
but there is a love of the
land that shines through.

47:00.440 --> 47:03.483
This farm is your querencia.

47:05.620 --> 47:10.213
And if you leave it,
you're gonna lose yourself.

47:12.250 --> 47:14.600
And your pictures aren't
ever gonna be as good.

47:21.451 --> 47:23.160
- That's right.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.783
Tell you over and over and over.

47:26.745 --> 47:27.828
Jesus Christ.

47:34.180 --> 47:36.466
Okay, try it!

47:36.466 --> 47:37.299
Try it!

47:48.483 --> 47:50.816
(screaming)

47:55.473 --> 47:57.556
(crying)

49:18.815 --> 49:21.313
- [Aubrey] I'm not sure, Tom.

49:21.313 --> 49:22.650
- What do you mean you're not sure?

49:22.650 --> 49:25.468
- I mean, I'm not sure I
can work, it really hurts.

49:25.468 --> 49:29.420
- Aubs, come on, it's, it's not that bad.

49:29.420 --> 49:33.060
Look, grab my hand, squeeze my hand.

49:33.060 --> 49:34.250
Tighter!
(groaning)

49:34.250 --> 49:37.300
Come on!
- I am squeezing, Tom, god!

49:37.300 --> 49:38.900
- Well, maybe the bandage
needs to be tighter.

49:38.900 --> 49:41.790
- My fingers are numb, just stop it.

49:41.790 --> 49:42.623
- Hey, Mom.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.060
How ya doin'?

49:45.060 --> 49:48.620
- Oh, just trying to figure
out somethin' for tomorrow.

49:48.620 --> 49:50.140
- Why don't you take the day to rest?

49:50.140 --> 49:52.483
- Yeah, sure, take your sick leave.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.940
Look, her hand got pinched.

49:57.940 --> 49:59.620
Christ Almighty, it's
the end of the world?

49:59.620 --> 50:01.440
- I'm sure it's gonna be fine by tomorrow.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.910
- Mom, you can take a goddamn day.

50:02.910 --> 50:05.070
- No, she can't.
- Yes, she can.

50:05.070 --> 50:07.140
You slammed her hand
in the hood of a truck!

50:07.140 --> 50:08.730
- [Tom] This is the worst damn timing.

50:08.730 --> 50:11.280
- I know, I'm sorry, I'll be fine.

50:11.280 --> 50:12.990
- You're sorry?

50:12.990 --> 50:14.133
I'm going into town.

50:15.150 --> 50:16.643
- Bright and early tomorrow!

51:12.275 --> 51:15.108
(baby vocalizing)

51:28.049 --> 51:28.882
(water splashing)

51:28.882 --> 51:31.132
(sneezing)

51:41.355 --> 51:45.355
(humming "Ring Around A Rosey")

52:25.986 --> 52:28.236
(retching)

52:49.790 --> 52:51.033
- [Kathryn] Yes, I know.

52:54.663 --> 52:55.733
I will.

52:56.610 --> 52:57.683
I promise.

53:00.100 --> 53:01.143
She will.

53:02.740 --> 53:04.516
She will.

53:04.516 --> 53:06.766
(coughing)

53:12.250 --> 53:13.600
- Are you goin' to bed?

53:13.600 --> 53:15.410
- Yeah, are you okay?

53:15.410 --> 53:16.990
- I should get some water for this cough.

53:16.990 --> 53:18.508
I think it's allergies.

53:18.508 --> 53:20.758
(coughing)

53:48.800 --> 53:53.593
- Well, if it isn't the
housewife without a husband.

53:55.920 --> 53:57.790
- I didn't catch that.

53:57.790 --> 54:00.063
- Your daddy's cash cow
starting to produce?

54:01.680 --> 54:02.513
What's that?

54:03.690 --> 54:05.400
More drinkin' money?

54:05.400 --> 54:07.490
- Screw you, Kathryn.

54:07.490 --> 54:10.607
- Heather, what are you doin'?

54:12.240 --> 54:14.406
Your sister's gonna be
gone just like your Mom

54:14.406 --> 54:18.630
and once some moron falls
in love with George,

54:18.630 --> 54:19.930
where does that leave you?

54:21.044 --> 54:22.524
You got so much potential--

54:22.524 --> 54:25.191
(loud coughing)

54:27.648 --> 54:29.823
You got so much potential, girl.

54:32.938 --> 54:36.433
I could teach you how
to manage the business.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.940
You and Christina could run it together.

54:44.290 --> 54:45.790
I've seen how you look at her.

54:54.320 --> 54:57.663
You think about it, young lady! (coughs)

55:04.780 --> 55:06.810
- We got something from Patriot.

55:06.810 --> 55:08.386
- What is it?

55:08.386 --> 55:10.186
It might be our first royalty check.

55:19.088 --> 55:19.921
- Well?

55:23.447 --> 55:25.000
- That can't be right.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.073
- [Heather] Let me see.

55:28.960 --> 55:29.860
- Wait, that's it?

55:31.750 --> 55:35.690
- Transportation fees, processing fees.

55:35.690 --> 55:37.743
It's not right, I'll give 'em a call.

55:39.260 --> 55:41.250
- Does that mean there's no gas?

55:41.250 --> 55:42.083
- [George] I don't know.

55:42.083 --> 55:44.337
I don't know, she's callin'.

55:45.960 --> 55:48.013
- [Heather] Hello, is this
the billing department?

55:49.000 --> 55:51.990
My family just received
a check and, yeah, yes.

55:51.990 --> 55:56.990
1-0-0-8-7-4-5-9.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.480
Last name, Lomack.

55:59.480 --> 56:00.396
- [Kim] I mean, there has to be a mistake.

56:00.396 --> 56:01.530
- [Heather] Yeah, we
were wondering if you can

56:01.530 --> 56:02.363
explain these fees.

56:02.363 --> 56:04.280
- Or maybe the first
one's lower or something.

56:04.280 --> 56:07.860
- [Heather] No, no, the
fees that are on the.

56:07.860 --> 56:11.033
Yeah, yes, the ones that are
on the check we received today.

56:13.210 --> 56:15.773
Yeah, I don't understand
what that means, can you.

56:16.870 --> 56:18.962
No, our contract didn't
state we were paying for...

56:18.962 --> 56:21.879
(muffled speaking)

56:26.228 --> 56:28.411
Dad?

56:28.411 --> 56:29.373
Dad?

56:32.351 --> 56:33.670
- What did they say?

56:33.670 --> 56:37.113
- Well, it is stated in our contract

56:37.113 --> 56:42.113
that they can charge us
for transportation fees

56:46.940 --> 56:50.320
and, um, cleaning fees,

56:51.980 --> 56:55.034
and also marketing fees,

56:55.034 --> 56:56.473
which, which,

56:57.800 --> 56:59.400
which is really blowing my mind.

57:01.566 --> 57:05.433
And then to top it all off
there's the market price

57:07.290 --> 57:08.670
of natural gas or something.

57:08.670 --> 57:11.220
You know how natural gas
is really cheap right now.

57:12.060 --> 57:13.180
- So basically we're fucked.

57:13.180 --> 57:14.640
- Kim.
- No, this is bullshit

57:14.640 --> 57:15.593
and you know it!

57:16.453 --> 57:19.900
All that dirt and that noise,
and we don't get shit from it!

57:19.900 --> 57:21.260
Are you serious?

57:21.260 --> 57:22.920
- Kim!
- What?

57:22.920 --> 57:24.926
- [Heather] Why don't
you let me talk to Dad?

57:24.926 --> 57:25.843
- Assholes!

57:30.091 --> 57:31.424
- [Heather] Dad.

57:35.991 --> 57:38.574
- This was supposed to save us.

57:49.799 --> 57:52.716
(breathing deeply)

58:15.496 --> 58:18.413
(breathing deeply)

59:04.374 --> 59:06.791
(whimpering)

59:22.384 --> 59:25.384
(breathing painfully)

59:41.086 --> 59:43.336
(coughing)

59:45.532 --> 59:48.249
- Make it stop, Joe!

59:48.249 --> 59:49.806
Make it stop!

59:49.806 --> 59:52.056
(groaning)

59:55.767 --> 59:58.100
(screaming)

01:00:48.066 --> 01:00:48.899
- Kathryn!

01:00:50.999 --> 01:00:51.832
Kathryn!

01:00:57.368 --> 01:01:00.368
(breathing heavily)

01:01:47.584 --> 01:01:50.417
(baby vocalizing)

01:01:56.831 --> 01:01:58.011
- Hey.

01:01:58.011 --> 01:01:59.344
Hey, Reesey, hi.

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:04.347
Oh, come here, come here, hi.

01:02:06.992 --> 01:02:08.075
Good morning.

01:02:11.032 --> 01:02:13.282
(coughing)

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:28.853
- Kathryn?

01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:36.699
(coughing)

01:02:41.946 --> 01:02:43.033
Jesus, Mom.

01:02:44.476 --> 01:02:45.753
Oh my god, you should go to the doctor.

01:02:45.753 --> 01:02:49.323
- It's gonna be fine, just. (coughs)

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:12.623
- [Heather] I got it!

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:17.063
Hello?

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:18.853
What's wrong?

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.600
I'll come right after dinner then.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.273
Christina needs me!

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.713
Kathryn's missing.

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:57.263
- [Tom] Mom?

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.807
- It's just a sheet.

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:26.520
- Please, for Mama, please.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.990
Please.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.348
A little bit, little bit?

01:04:29.348 --> 01:04:30.181
Oh.

01:04:33.506 --> 01:04:36.423
Come on, please, just a little bit.

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.034
Come on.

01:04:41.034 --> 01:04:42.072
No.

01:04:42.072 --> 01:04:43.905
It's really good, see?

01:04:48.921 --> 01:04:49.754
Oh my.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.780
- [Heather] Christina?

01:05:34.513 --> 01:05:36.346
- [Christina] Kathryn?

01:05:41.353 --> 01:05:42.186
- Oh, hey.

01:05:49.199 --> 01:05:50.638
What's goin' on?

01:05:50.638 --> 01:05:51.721
Are you okay?

01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:58.094
Okay.

01:05:58.094 --> 01:05:59.427
Okay, come here.

01:06:07.705 --> 01:06:09.353
Ow, damn it!

01:06:09.353 --> 01:06:11.853
(baby crying)

01:06:12.915 --> 01:06:14.470
What's goin' on?

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.303
Hey.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:18.293
Come on, come on, come on.

01:06:20.413 --> 01:06:22.913
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

(baby crying)

01:07:03.156 --> 01:07:05.406

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:31.700
(groaning)

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:15.056
- Did you fuck my dad?

01:08:25.357 --> 01:08:28.107
(women grunting)

01:08:42.157 --> 01:08:42.990
Let go!

01:09:15.975 --> 01:09:18.809
(water splashing)

01:09:21.776 --> 01:09:24.276

(groaning)

01:12:25.555 --> 01:12:26.388
- Mama?

01:12:37.322 --> 01:12:38.701
Mama?

01:12:38.701 --> 01:12:39.534
No!

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.623
(animal croaking)

01:12:45.767 --> 01:12:46.760

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.120
I'm gonna need you to...

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:51.199

01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:56.103
Tom?

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.290
Tom, back away now!

01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:02.640
Oh god! (groans)

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:17.861

01:13:24.521 --> 01:13:25.354
No!

01:13:27.029 --> 01:13:27.862
Daddy!

01:13:43.612 --> 01:13:45.945
(screaming)

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:49.500
It's okay, baby, it's okay.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.828
Okay, hey.
- I want my baby!

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:55.161
(screaming)

01:14:03.037 --> 01:14:04.537
- Dad, stay there.

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:07.374
- Ring around the rosey.

01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:10.843
- [Heather] Put the gun down!

01:14:10.843 --> 01:14:15.843
- A pocket full of posey.
(gun firing)

01:14:21.986 --> 01:14:24.227
- Daddy, please!

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:25.060

(baby crying)

01:14:28.303 --> 01:14:30.720

01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:38.561
(distant crying)

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.394
Reesey?

01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:45.456
Is that you?

01:14:45.456 --> 01:14:47.623
The cows are in the meadow

01:14:51.124 --> 01:14:52.707
huddled altogether.

01:14:55.881 --> 01:15:00.130
Ashes, they all.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:02.563
Where are you, you little bastard?

01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:06.302
- You, killed him!

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:10.802

01:15:22.772 --> 01:15:24.355
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:27.246 --> 01:15:28.079
- [Kim] Reese.

01:15:28.079 --> 01:15:28.996
- Kim, Kim!

01:15:29.867 --> 01:15:32.700

01:15:39.013 --> 01:15:39.846
(woman screaming)

01:15:39.846 --> 01:15:41.125
We gotta go.

01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:42.708
- [Christina] Help!

01:15:43.546 --> 01:15:44.379
No, no!

01:15:45.794 --> 01:15:46.711
Wait, stop!

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:49.640
- [George] Kim.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.793
- Dad, I'm staying.

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.160
When you're safe, call me
at the Dolan's. - I love you.

01:16:10.801 --> 01:16:13.218
(whimpering)

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:19.364

(man choking)
(man grunting)

01:17:02.174 --> 01:17:03.007
- Die!

01:17:06.675 --> 01:17:08.925
(grunting)

01:17:12.918 --> 01:17:15.918
(breathing heavily)

01:17:47.968 --> 01:17:49.801
- Whose blood is that?

01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:53.413
- Kim's hurt.

01:17:56.544 --> 01:17:57.461
