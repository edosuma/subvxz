[animal growling]

00:07.875 --> 00:11.166
-[screeching]
-[howling]

00:14.958 --> 00:16.208
[boat horn blowing]

00:16.750 --> 00:19.875
[Bonnie laughing] Oh!
Who spiked my canteen?

00:20.375 --> 00:23.208
I'm looking at you, Greg, you saucy lush.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.083
Don't worry, everyone. These old
charter ferries are incredibly--

00:26.166 --> 00:27.416
-[thuds]
-Ow! Ugh!

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
Incredibly-- Oh! [groans]

00:30.291 --> 00:32.083
[groaning]

00:32.166 --> 00:33.541
Forget it. Forget it.

00:33.625 --> 00:36.041
Guys, dudes, take a load off.

00:36.125 --> 00:40.166
Why stand when you can sit,
and why sit when you can lounge?

00:40.250 --> 00:41.125
[slurping]

00:41.208 --> 00:42.125
Wait a minute.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.375
Why aren't you squawking
like a parrot in a blender?

00:45.458 --> 00:48.000
Who are you
and what have you done with my Dietrich?

00:48.083 --> 00:49.291
[slurping]

00:49.375 --> 00:51.583
Ah! I thought you'd never ask.

00:51.666 --> 00:55.416
You are looking at the proud owner
of a seven-night stay

00:55.500 --> 00:58.625
at Sandy Corners, Sandy Corners,
Sandy Corners.

00:58.708 --> 00:59.875
Sandy what?

00:59.958 --> 01:03.541
You've never heard of Sandy Corners,
the all-inclusive tropical resort

01:03.625 --> 01:06.041
with pristine private beaches,
world-class snackage,

01:06.125 --> 01:09.500
and luxury spa run by famed masseuse
and former Soviet submarine commander,

01:09.583 --> 01:10.791
Petyr Alexandrovich?

01:11.458 --> 01:12.583
Mmm.

01:12.666 --> 01:13.958
I pity you.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.125
[slurping]

01:15.208 --> 01:19.458
Anyway, there's a three-year waiting list,
and I finally got in.

01:19.541 --> 01:23.875
So, as soon as this boat docks,
the Dietrich you know and love is dead,

01:23.958 --> 01:26.666
and Vacation Dietrich is born.

01:26.750 --> 01:27.875
-[wave crashing]
-Whoa!

01:27.958 --> 01:30.416
Maybe we should take Greg down
so he doesn't fall.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.083
He's been hanging there a while now
completely motionless.

01:33.166 --> 01:34.250
Is he dying?

01:34.333 --> 01:37.375
He's fine. He could hang
on his claw bones indefinitely

01:37.458 --> 01:38.666
using zero energy.

01:38.750 --> 01:43.000
In fact, sloths only climb down
once a week to defecate on the ground.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.666
<i>And when they do,</i>
<i>they're often killed by predators.</i>

01:45.750 --> 01:46.666
-[squeaks]
<i>-Ha!</i>

01:46.750 --> 01:49.916
So, if he was lazier
and pooped from his tree,

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
he'd live longer?

01:51.083 --> 01:52.041
Pretty much.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.125
Laziness is smart.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.625
Greg would love Sandy Corners.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.833
Every beach chair has its own bed pan.

01:58.916 --> 02:00.375
Ugh! Gross.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.250
Are you sure this isn't a hospice?

02:02.333 --> 02:04.000
-[wave crashes]
-Whoa! [grunts]

02:04.083 --> 02:05.125
It's okay.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.625
[screams] Steam!

02:06.708 --> 02:08.833
-Holy crap! Dietrich!
-Shield your eyes, man!

02:08.916 --> 02:11.500
Liquid hell! It burns! It burns!

02:12.083 --> 02:13.666
Oh, wait a second.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.083
Ah, it's not that hot.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.458
Oh, and my pores opened up,
so that's nice.

02:17.541 --> 02:18.958
-[explodes]
-[Dietrich screams]

02:19.791 --> 02:22.916
[speaking Spanish]

02:23.000 --> 02:25.916
Whoa! I think I actually understood that.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.041
-That Spanish app really paid off.
-What'd he say?

02:29.125 --> 02:33.041
He said, "My salad is on fire!
Abandon my birthday!"

02:33.125 --> 02:34.125
He's very upset.

02:34.666 --> 02:36.333
There's a fire in the engine room!

02:36.416 --> 02:40.541
-Oh. Right, that makes more sense.
-We should just get to the lifeboat.

02:40.625 --> 02:43.625
And abandon this beautiful vessel
without a fight? Ha!

02:43.708 --> 02:45.291
-[fire whooshes]
-"Ha"?

02:45.375 --> 02:47.333
That's not the right place for a "ha"!

02:50.500 --> 02:52.375
[screaming]

02:52.458 --> 02:54.166
Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

02:54.250 --> 02:55.541
Burning! Burning!

02:56.208 --> 02:57.875
We gotta isolate the engine room.

02:59.291 --> 03:01.583
[grunting]

03:01.666 --> 03:04.250
-The main stairwell is compromised.
-[wailing]

03:04.333 --> 03:05.333
Hmm?

03:05.416 --> 03:07.375
-I'm fine.
-[BTG] We're going down!

03:09.083 --> 03:10.083
[whimpering]

03:10.166 --> 03:11.375
[grunting]

03:13.541 --> 03:15.083
[farting]

03:16.208 --> 03:17.416
[Bonnie] Hyah!

03:17.500 --> 03:19.000
[all grunting]

03:23.583 --> 03:26.291
[panting] Abandon ship!
Women and sloths first!

03:26.375 --> 03:28.916
-Help me!
-[water splashes]

03:29.000 --> 03:31.375
Greg, no!

03:31.458 --> 03:32.541
[BTG screams]

03:32.625 --> 03:33.625
Jump!

03:34.250 --> 03:35.750
-[explodes]
-[all scream]

03:37.750 --> 03:40.666
Yeah, we probably should have
just gotten on the lifeboat.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.791
But Sandy Corners…

03:43.958 --> 03:45.500
[animal growling]

03:45.583 --> 03:48.791
-[screeching]
-[howling]

03:49.875 --> 03:52.500
[BTG] <i>Without food, water, or supplies,</i>

03:52.583 --> 03:54.708
<i>my companions and I</i>
<i>were forced to consider</i>

03:54.791 --> 03:56.666
<i>all viable survival strategies.</i>

03:56.750 --> 04:00.875
[Bonnie] What's the normal number of days
before we should start eating each other?

04:00.958 --> 04:02.583
Six? Seven?

04:02.666 --> 04:03.958
No one's getting eaten.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.458
The less energy we expend,
the less food we need.

04:06.541 --> 04:08.500
We should all
just try to go to sleep, okay?

04:08.583 --> 04:10.708
I'm supposed to be sleeping
in a silken hammock

04:10.791 --> 04:13.083
while enjoying
a hydrating green tea enema,

04:13.166 --> 04:16.166
to reduce stress and constipation.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.750
That resort is definitely a hospice.

04:18.833 --> 04:22.458
Ugh! These plastic seat cushions
aren't even eucalyptus infused.

04:22.541 --> 04:26.458
Okay, so the plan is
we're just gonna die of hunger and thirst

04:26.541 --> 04:27.791
in our sleep, then?

04:27.875 --> 04:29.625
Just breathe, Bonbon.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.333
[breathes deeply]

04:31.416 --> 04:33.250
Time to slow your metabolism.

04:33.333 --> 04:37.208
No! I'm not going to lay down
when our lives are at stake.

04:37.291 --> 04:38.958
[grunts] You can thank me later.

04:39.958 --> 04:40.958
Whoa!

04:42.041 --> 04:43.041
[sighs]

04:43.125 --> 04:45.875
Come on!
The ocean isn't big enough for you?

04:45.958 --> 04:48.250
[grunts] That's a Portuguese man o' war.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.583
Its inflated air sac is like a tiny sail

04:50.666 --> 04:52.958
and allows the wind to take it
wherever it blows.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.583
You're lucky it didn't sting you.

04:54.666 --> 04:57.166
Saving energy is the key to our survival.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.000
Remember the African lungfish?

04:59.083 --> 05:02.291
When faced with drought,
African lungfish will burrow underground

05:02.375 --> 05:06.041
and sleep inside a mucous cocoon
in the mud for up to four years,

05:06.125 --> 05:08.791
waiting patiently
for the next heavy rainfall.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.750
[blows, grunts]

05:17.375 --> 05:20.625
Mmm, mucus is nature's
memory foam mattress.

05:20.708 --> 05:23.500
I never told you this,
but while you slept in your mucus bed,

05:23.583 --> 05:24.791
I left and got a hotel room.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.333
Hah. So, that's why
you didn't get guinea worms.

05:27.416 --> 05:29.750
The point is,
until conditions are more favorable,

05:29.833 --> 05:31.291
we should just go to sleep.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.666
[groans] I can't sleep during a crisis.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.416
I'm a mover, a doer!

05:35.500 --> 05:38.458
My body rejects entropy
at a cellular level.

05:38.541 --> 05:41.625
Doing nothing is the exact opposite
of my life's purpose.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.625
[snoring] Yes, Petyr, I would love
a complimentary stem cell Jell-O shot.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.708
-[giggles]
-[yells] Excuse me!

05:47.791 --> 05:51.083
You've got to have something in here!
An outboard motor, a hang glider?

05:51.166 --> 05:53.333
A car battery and some nipple clamps?

05:53.416 --> 05:55.666
You kept the spice rack
I made you in middle school?

05:55.750 --> 05:56.791
Of course I did.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.083
Aw.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.458
-[grunts]
-Aw.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.416
What's this?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.416
-[gasps] Airplane vodka?
-No, Bonnie, that's--

06:03.500 --> 06:04.416
[gulping]

06:04.500 --> 06:05.750
Tranquilizer.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.000
More like "Thank you-lizer,"

06:08.083 --> 06:13.250
because, honestly, my overactive brain
craves oblivion right now.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.875
-[body thuds]
-[Bonnie snoring]

06:14.958 --> 06:17.458
-[Dietrich] Can I get a hit of that?
-Go to sleep.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.000
[pleasant music playing]

06:22.833 --> 06:24.041
[birds calling]

06:26.583 --> 06:30.250
Hello and welcome
to beautiful Sandy Corners.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.416
Aloha.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.250
Wait, this isn't Hawaii.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.291
It's even better than I imagined.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.625
-[gasps]
-Aw.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.583
-[monitor beeping]
-[patient coughing]

06:40.666 --> 06:42.416
Hydration, anyone?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.125
-Make mine a double.
-This is a hospice, Dietrich.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.375
A bloody hospice!

06:46.458 --> 06:47.833
-[wave crashing]
-Whoa!

06:49.250 --> 06:50.958
Sweet heavens! An Island!

06:53.541 --> 06:55.208
Did someone say "island"?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.333
Oh my God!

06:58.083 --> 07:00.625
My heart is home at last.

07:00.708 --> 07:03.208
Vacation Dietrich is back!

07:03.291 --> 07:05.833
Gotta work on that base tan, baby!

07:05.916 --> 07:06.916
Come on, Bonnie.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.750
[grunts] Here you go, wake up.

07:08.833 --> 07:09.833
[grunts]

07:10.333 --> 07:12.416
Which bin does the cardboard go in?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.041
[scoffs] So confusing.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.250
Bonnie, we made it back to land.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.541
-What?
-See?

07:17.625 --> 07:21.250
That's a magnificent frigatebird.
We might be close to the Galapagos.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.833
-[frigate bird calling]
-Birdie choking on a tomato.

07:23.916 --> 07:25.833
That's his red gular sac.

07:25.916 --> 07:29.500
The bigger and redder his sac,
the more attractive they are to females.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.083
So the opposite of humans.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.125
I guess.

07:33.208 --> 07:34.333
[calling]

07:35.583 --> 07:38.833
-No!
-Oh! Ooh, you hate to see that.

07:38.916 --> 07:42.000
Sometimes, jealous males
will slash their rival's larger sac,

07:42.083 --> 07:44.583
because they're too lazy
to compete for mates.

07:44.666 --> 07:47.875
That's a smart energy-saving strategy,
but still a jerk move.

07:47.958 --> 07:49.416
[sizzling]

07:50.291 --> 07:52.458
You guys see a spit roast on your way up?

07:52.541 --> 07:55.541
That sizzling meat aroma is amazing.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.208
Ahh! Talking lobster!

07:57.291 --> 08:00.000
Mmm, yeah, that's your flesh
being scorched by the sun.

08:00.083 --> 08:02.250
Okay, you guys can set up camp
on the beach.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.666
Leave Greg in the boat
till we know where we are.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.041
-I'm gonna look for fresh water.
-Aye aye, BT Jesus!

08:08.125 --> 08:10.083
-[thuds on ground]
-[snoring]

08:10.708 --> 08:12.041

[rustling]

08:26.166 --> 08:27.166
[gasps]

08:29.583 --> 08:32.041
Mmm! That's delicious!

08:32.125 --> 08:33.166
Mmm!

08:33.708 --> 08:35.250
Hardly any animal urine.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.666
Could use some more, actually.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.541
-[snarling]
-Huh?

08:41.458 --> 08:42.375
Hmm.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.791
-[hissing]
-[screams] Black caiman!

08:45.833 --> 08:47.083
This place is-- [grunts]

08:49.416 --> 08:51.041

-Ow!

08:52.750 --> 08:55.000
[yelping]

08:55.583 --> 08:57.000
[muffled scream]

08:57.083 --> 08:59.500
[screaming]

08:59.583 --> 09:03.500
Man, that stuff really did
a number on my head.

09:03.583 --> 09:04.833
How long was I out for?

09:04.916 --> 09:06.250
One sloth poop.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.750
An entire week? Damn!

09:08.833 --> 09:12.500
I can't believe how lucky we got.
This island is paradise.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.708
It might even be better
than Sandy Corners.

09:14.791 --> 09:16.083
[BTG screaming]

09:16.708 --> 09:17.541
What's that?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.000
-[jaguar growling]
-Get back in the boat!

09:20.083 --> 09:21.666
This wasn't in the brochure!

09:21.750 --> 09:23.833
-Holy sh--
-Go, go, go, go, go!

09:23.916 --> 09:27.541
This island is swarming with predators!
I've never seen anything like it.

09:27.625 --> 09:30.166
There are caiman on the riverbank,
jaguar in the trees,

09:30.250 --> 09:32.208
anaconda in the marsh,
piranha in the water!

09:32.291 --> 09:34.375
Yeah, and pollen in the air. [sneezes]

09:36.541 --> 09:38.000
[snarling]

09:39.250 --> 09:40.500
This place is like a…

09:41.208 --> 09:42.791
Predator Island.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.541
Ooh! I love that show.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.750
It's all about men who creep on women
until they're uncomfortable.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.625
Didn't have great ratings.

09:50.708 --> 09:52.041
[screams] Sharks!

09:52.125 --> 09:53.333
[thuds]

09:53.416 --> 09:57.458
I can't die on vacation.
No one would take my funeral seriously!

09:57.541 --> 10:01.416
That's what I'm talking about.
This place is a glorious death trap.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.583
-Uncle B, what the hell are you doing?
-Pushing you to safety.

10:04.666 --> 10:07.750
[grunts] Tiger sharks
are incredibly lazy hunters.

10:07.833 --> 10:10.083
They don't waste energy
chasing active prey.

10:10.166 --> 10:13.750
If they can't sneak up on an easy kill,
they usually can't be bothered.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.250
[screams]

10:15.333 --> 10:16.750
Okay, maybe not that lazy.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.208
[screams]

10:19.291 --> 10:21.166
[grunting]

10:21.250 --> 10:22.166
[pants]

10:25.791 --> 10:27.166
[grunts]

10:27.250 --> 10:28.500
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:29.583 --> 10:32.375
[sighs] That went pretty well,
all things considered.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.583
[sighs] Thank God, we're finally…

10:35.291 --> 10:36.291
safe?

10:36.833 --> 10:41.208
[BTG] <i>We had spent 84 days</i>
<i>or 12 sloth poops on that tiny rock.</i>

10:41.291 --> 10:43.250
<i>We had perfected the art of surviving</i>

10:43.333 --> 10:46.000
<i>while expending</i>
<i>the fewest resources possible.</i>

10:46.833 --> 10:49.416
<i>Rather than expend energy</i>
<i>hunting for fish,</i>

10:49.500 --> 10:52.833
<i>alligator snapping turtles</i>
<i>sit perfectly still</i> <i>with jaws wide open</i>

10:52.916 --> 10:55.500
<i>and wiggle the tip of their tongue</i>
<i>like it's a worm,</i>

10:55.583 --> 10:58.333
<i>hoping to lure a hungry fish</i>
<i>right into their mouth.</i>

10:58.833 --> 11:00.208
[wiggles tongue]

11:00.291 --> 11:01.291
[grunts]

11:05.125 --> 11:08.125
-Where'd you get the beach toys?
-In my vacation bag.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.708
[sighing] Ah.

11:10.791 --> 11:13.666
Dietrich, how long has Bonnie been away
on her water run?

11:13.750 --> 11:16.541
Let's see what the poop clock says.
Two days.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.291
Two days. Okay.

11:18.375 --> 11:21.125
Wait, wait, wait, two days?
How long was I fishing?

11:21.208 --> 11:22.916
Uh, two days.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.666
Ugh, I should have never let Bonnie
go out on her own.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.750
I'm gonna look for her.
I promised my sister I'd keep her safe.

11:28.833 --> 11:31.125
You wouldn't go looking for me
after two days.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.958
My sister doesn't even know you exist, so…

11:34.041 --> 11:36.916
Okey-dokey.
I'm gonna keep making my sandcastle.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.166
When you come back,
I'll be Lord Dietrich of Shell Manor,

11:41.250 --> 11:44.458
the toast of Sandy Corners,
Sandy Corners, Sandy Corners.

11:44.541 --> 11:45.625
Dietrich, stop.

11:47.458 --> 11:48.458
Bullet ants.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.875
They have one of the most painful stings
of any insect.

11:50.958 --> 11:53.208
It feels like getting hit by a bullet.

11:53.291 --> 11:54.708
Oh, mother.

11:57.291 --> 12:00.208
This vacation is over!

12:00.291 --> 12:01.666
-[screams]
-[water splashes]

12:01.750 --> 12:04.708
Dietrich, grab the fish basket!
It's our only food.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.375
-[Dietrich screams]
-[water splashes]

12:06.458 --> 12:09.291
Ahh! This is the worst vacation
of my life!

12:09.375 --> 12:12.708
Zero stars and a harshly worded review!

12:14.916 --> 12:16.458
[BTG] All right, let's go.

12:16.541 --> 12:19.166
We can't go back in there.
There's monsters.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.666
And possibly poison oak.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.500
Oh God. Something's out there.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.541
Vacation vibes. Vacation vibes.

12:31.416 --> 12:33.208
[screams] Don't eat me!

12:33.291 --> 12:34.333
My blood is bitter

12:34.416 --> 12:37.125
from all the purple cabbage
I ate as a child! [sobbing]

12:37.208 --> 12:38.625
[BTG] Dietrich, quiet!

12:38.708 --> 12:44.000
Hmm, this is a recently shed
Anaconda skin. It's perfect.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.125
Perfect? How?

12:52.958 --> 12:54.000
[snarls]

12:55.500 --> 12:56.416
[hisses]

12:57.000 --> 13:00.666
Wow, it's hot, dark,
and smells like a rotting reptile.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.375
Brings back memories.

13:02.458 --> 13:03.750
Ah. Oh yeah? Why?

13:03.833 --> 13:05.708
The last time
you cut me out of a giant snake.

13:05.791 --> 13:07.250
Ah! Borneo.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.666
[laughs]

13:08.750 --> 13:09.791
Good times.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.125
[both grunt]

13:12.583 --> 13:13.541
[BTG] Mm-hmm.

13:13.625 --> 13:17.625
Looks like Bonnie took the river plank,
so we'll have to make a raft.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.416
-[blowing]
-Huh?

13:20.583 --> 13:22.208
Where did you get a pool toy?

13:22.291 --> 13:24.125
It was in my vacation bag.

13:24.208 --> 13:27.375
Oh no!
The dead skin is full of living snake!

13:27.458 --> 13:28.958
-Come on.
-[hissing]

13:30.041 --> 13:32.041
[animals calling]

13:33.708 --> 13:35.375
[snarling]

13:35.458 --> 13:37.000
Don't move a muscle,

13:37.083 --> 13:39.500
or we'll look
like a floating charcuterie plate.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.791
[whimpers] The monkeys are feeding
the piranha. They're in cahoots.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.875
-We're dead.
-Those aren't piranha, they're pacus.

13:49.958 --> 13:51.958
Rather than forage for themselves,

13:52.041 --> 13:53.583
pacus follow troops of monkeys

13:53.666 --> 13:55.958
and eat the fruit
they discard in the water.

13:56.041 --> 13:58.833
It's like eating
your roommates' leftovers.

14:00.458 --> 14:02.583
Oh God, they have human teeth!

14:02.666 --> 14:05.750
Mmm, they do look bizarrely human,
but don't worry,

14:05.833 --> 14:09.000
they only use them to peel
the sweet flesh off of seeds and nuts.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.041
I'm scared.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.458
Beach vibes, Dietrich.

14:11.541 --> 14:13.625
-[in singsong] Beach vibes.
-[yelps]

14:14.541 --> 14:16.083
-[screeching]
-[screaming]

14:16.791 --> 14:18.958
Stay away from my sweet nut flesh!

14:19.041 --> 14:20.875
[screaming]

14:20.958 --> 14:22.166
No! Caiman!

14:22.250 --> 14:23.500
[hissing]

14:23.583 --> 14:25.375
[screams] Anaconda!

14:25.458 --> 14:27.458
-[snarls]
-[groans]

14:27.541 --> 14:28.875
At least cats can't swim.

14:28.958 --> 14:30.875
[BTG] Actually, most cat species can swim.

14:30.958 --> 14:31.833
[screams]

14:31.916 --> 14:33.666
Help!

14:34.416 --> 14:37.125
-[jaguar growls]
-I'm gonna die on a pool floaty!

14:37.208 --> 14:38.416
My mother was right!

14:38.500 --> 14:40.083
Uncle B!

14:41.291 --> 14:42.750
Bonnie! You're alive!

14:42.833 --> 14:44.375
Here, grab my hand!

14:45.000 --> 14:47.458
-Safety!
-Dietrich, no!

14:47.541 --> 14:49.875
-[gasps] Uncle B, look!
-What?

14:51.958 --> 14:54.333
It's got supplies, maybe even a radio.

14:54.416 --> 14:56.916
-I'll come back for you!
-[jaguar growling]

14:58.041 --> 14:59.583
[BTG] Okay, Greg, hear me out.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.333
All that prevents us
from rescuing Bonnie and Dietrich

15:02.416 --> 15:05.958
are countless deadly predators
in the trees, in the water and on land.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.791
And we can't fly.

15:08.625 --> 15:09.875
Any ideas?

15:12.458 --> 15:14.291
Hmm. [gasps]

15:14.916 --> 15:16.000
That's it!

15:23.083 --> 15:25.708
-[animal snarling]
-[BTG screaming]

15:28.666 --> 15:30.666
[panting]

15:37.541 --> 15:38.541
[bursts]

15:38.625 --> 15:41.791
Why do the work yourself
when you can have others do it for you?

15:41.875 --> 15:43.375
-[guffaws]
-[snarls]

15:44.708 --> 15:46.375
What happened to all the animals?

15:46.458 --> 15:49.333
Maybe they're inventing a trampoline
to bounce up here and kill us.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.375
[rustling]

15:51.458 --> 15:54.458
Oh God, here it comes! Trampoline attack!

15:56.875 --> 15:57.875
Aah! Uncle B!

15:57.958 --> 16:00.208
Bonnie, Dietrich, come on!
There's not much time.

16:02.916 --> 16:05.708
-Where did the predators go?
-They're busy, but not for long.

16:05.791 --> 16:09.083
Just keep moving, do exactly what I do,
and you'll both be fine.

16:14.208 --> 16:16.625
[gasps] Look!
There's a bunch of parachutes.

16:17.666 --> 16:20.000
-And here are some fuel canisters.
-And here's…

16:20.083 --> 16:21.583
uh, a metal box.

16:21.666 --> 16:23.083
[grunts] Come on.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.500
[yelps]

16:24.583 --> 16:26.125
[grunting]

16:26.208 --> 16:28.333
-Quicksand.
-I'm sinking! [grunts]

16:28.416 --> 16:29.708
What's the rule with quicksand?

16:29.791 --> 16:31.916
Work as hard as you can
and flail uncontrollably?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.041
No, no! The more you move,
the more you'll sink.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.208
But I've already started panicking!

16:36.291 --> 16:37.583
Whoa!

16:38.791 --> 16:40.958
The only way to survive is to give up.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.625
Just tap into your inner uselessness,
or we're both dead.

16:43.708 --> 16:46.916
Good news. I think I can use
these parachutes and this fuel canister

16:47.000 --> 16:48.875
to create a makeshift hot air balloon.

16:48.958 --> 16:51.125
Wow, that sounds even dumber
when I say that out loud.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.208
[grunting] Hurry, you…

16:53.291 --> 16:54.500
[sputtering]

16:54.583 --> 16:56.583
[adventurous music playing]

16:59.833 --> 17:01.208
[laughs]

17:01.291 --> 17:03.833
Hell, yeah! This is crazy!

17:03.916 --> 17:05.250
Right? [laughs]

17:05.333 --> 17:08.125
Honestly,
I'm surprised it's working at all!

17:11.041 --> 17:12.041
[Bonnie gasps] Look!

17:12.125 --> 17:13.041
This is it.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.333
If we could fly toward the boat,
they'll see us.

17:15.416 --> 17:18.875
Why are all your rescue missions
so terrifying?

17:19.875 --> 17:20.833
Frigatebird.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.291
[guttural squawk]

17:23.375 --> 17:24.375
[BTG] Hey, bird.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.583
Don't slash our big red sac.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.625
You beaky bastard!

17:29.708 --> 17:31.166
[all screaming]

17:31.958 --> 17:34.000
[groaning]

17:36.958 --> 17:39.541
Huh. They didn't see us.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.541
Oh, and there goes our big red flag.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.500
Wait, we've got something better.

17:46.125 --> 17:47.916
No! No, don't do it!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.125
Human sacrifices almost never work!

17:50.208 --> 17:51.375
Look away, Bonnie.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.291
[screams]

17:55.708 --> 17:56.833
[ship horn blares]

18:01.416 --> 18:04.291
-[gasps] They saw us! They saw us!
-Yes!

18:04.375 --> 18:07.250
Dietrich, your horrific sunburn
saved us all!

18:07.333 --> 18:08.583
Yeah, baby.

18:08.666 --> 18:11.125
I told you, gotta work on that base.

18:21.250 --> 18:25.875
[sighs] The curious fact about this island
was the extraordinary range of predators.

18:25.958 --> 18:27.833
-Both size--
-What are you doing, Uncle B?

18:27.916 --> 18:29.875
You're hanging like a sloth.

18:29.958 --> 18:31.458
Well, yes, because as a man of action,

18:31.541 --> 18:35.041
it's very hard for me to appreciate
the virtues of laziness.

18:35.125 --> 18:38.166
Now, our sloth friend here
is exerting zero energy,

18:38.250 --> 18:41.166
because his claws conceal solid bone,

18:41.250 --> 18:42.833
and that's the magic of sloths.

18:42.916 --> 18:44.083
Look at him hang there.

18:44.166 --> 18:47.791
No effort, because the bones
run right through his claws,

18:47.875 --> 18:50.500
and therefore,
he is, in effect, a furry coat hanger.

18:50.583 --> 18:54.416
You may call him ridiculous,
but he is the master of Zen.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.500
You know what?

18:56.041 --> 18:58.833
I think my pathetic tendons
and muscles are failing me.

18:58.916 --> 19:00.416
I could use a little help.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.500
-Bonnie?
-I never--

19:01.583 --> 19:03.166
[screams, thuds]

19:03.250 --> 19:04.833
Uncle B, are you okay?

19:04.916 --> 19:06.291
[BTG groaning]

19:06.375 --> 19:08.375
[groovy music playing]
