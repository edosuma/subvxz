05:36.537 --> 05:38.806
VERY DISTURBING.

- THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.576
- AND QUITE DIFFERENT
THAN THE WORK YOU SUBMITTED

05:42.610 --> 05:44.578
WHEN WE ACCEPTED YOU.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.681
- WELL, I DON'T SEE THINGS
THE SAME WAY.

05:47.715 --> 05:51.952
- PROFESSOR STANLEY TELLS ME
YOU'RE USING A COMPUTER.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.689
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY

05:55.723 --> 05:57.458
- WE EXPECT OUR STUDENTS

05:57.491 --> 06:00.060
TO MASTER
THE TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINES.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.166
- SOMETIMES,
THE TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINES

06:06.199 --> 06:09.036
CAN BE A HANDICAP TOO.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.174
I MEAN, AS MUCH AS NOT
BEING ABLE TO USE YOUR HAND.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.545
I THOUGHT THAT I COULD NEVER BE
AN ARTIST AGAIN,

06:17.578 --> 06:21.549
BUT INSTEAD, THIS HAS TAUGHT ME
NEW WAYS TO BE AN ARTIST,

06:21.582 --> 06:24.752
WAYS THAT I NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF OTHERWISE.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.025

06:32.059 --> 06:33.527

06:48.375 --> 06:49.810
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TURN HIM STRAIGHT?

06:49.843 --> 06:50.778
- [chuckles]

06:50.811 --> 06:52.780
- OH, SHIT, THEY'RE GONNA DO IT
RIGHT HERE.

06:52.813 --> 06:53.914
- I'LL GET MY CAMERA.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.849
- BETTER YET,
GET A ROOM.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.150

06:57.184 --> 06:59.720
- YEAH, IT MIGHT EARN YOU
A FEW BUCKS.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.954
- HELP PAY FOR COLLEGE.

07:00.988 --> 07:01.922
- DON'T PUT ANY IDEAS
IN HIS HEAD.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.990
- OR MINE.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.659
- MAYBE WE COULD DO IT,
HELP PAY FOR THE WEDDING.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.127
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
TEDDY?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.930
- SURE THING, MEL, JUST GROW
YOURSELF A 9-INCH COCK AND--

07:09.963 --> 07:11.799
[laughter]

07:11.832 --> 07:13.801
- COULD WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN SEX

07:13.834 --> 07:15.769
FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES,
YOU KNOW?

07:15.803 --> 07:17.738
- [stammers]

07:21.041 --> 07:22.976
- [clears throat]

07:26.113 --> 07:28.716

07:34.121 --> 07:36.590
- SO I-IF THE TWINK JERKS OFF
FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS,

07:36.624 --> 07:39.226
DOES HE GET OVERTIME?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.961
- UH, THAT'S--
[laughter]

07:40.994 --> 07:43.030
- DON'T YOU BUS HERE,
HONEY.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.965
YOU'RE NOT IN THE DINER.
SIT DOWN.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.535
- IT'S OKAY, I DON'T MIND.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.836
BRIAN,
WILL YOU GRAB THAT?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.037
- THAT?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.739
- AH, NOT THAT.
THE PLATTER, PLEASE.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.907

YES, DEAR.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.852
- HOLY CRAP, THEY'RE LIKE
FUCKING NEWLYWEDS.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.655
- I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD LIVE TO SEE IT.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.989
- I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.892
- YEAH.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.827
10 BUCKS SAYS
THEY DON'T LAST A MONTH.

08:13.861 --> 08:14.995
- I GIVE IT...

08:15.028 --> 08:16.129
THREE WEEKS.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.865
- CALL ME A ROMANTIC.
FIVE.

08:17.898 --> 08:21.168
- I'LL RAISE YOU TEN
AND SAY TWO.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.136
- [scoffs]
- AW, YOU'RE ALL PUSSIES.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.138
72 HOURS.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.941
[laughter]
- DEB?

08:27.975 --> 08:31.111
- I DON'T PUT A PRICE
ON PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.880
AND CONSIDERING
ALL THEY'VE GONE THROUGH,

08:32.913 --> 08:34.748
I'D THINK THEIR FRIENDS
WOULD BET FOR THE HOUSE

08:34.782 --> 08:37.751
INSTEAD OF AGAINST IT.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.221
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.690
- HMM.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.824
- SO, LINZ,

08:43.857 --> 08:46.259
- [laughs]
- WE HAVE TO GO.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.628
- [stammers]
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.162
WE HAVEN'T HAD DESSERT.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.599
- THE SITTER HAS TO BE HOME
BY 9:00.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.933
MEL?
- I'M SORRY.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.804
- I MADE PIE.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.046
- LINZ, YOU OKAY?

09:06.079 --> 09:11.118
- I'M FINE.
[clears throat]

09:11.151 --> 09:13.286
- CRAMPS?
- NO!

09:13.320 --> 09:15.222
[scoffs]

09:15.255 --> 09:17.658
- YOU'RE ACTING CRANKIER
THAN GUS WHEN HE NEEDS A NAP.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.860
- I JUST NEEDED TO GET
OUT OF THERE, THAT'S ALL.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.329
- [chuckles]
I KNOW, DEBBIE'S TCHOTCHKES

09:22.362 --> 09:24.197
KIND OF DRIVE ME
A LITTLE CRAZY TOO.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.899
- IT ISN'T THE TCHOTCHKES.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.067
IT'S LISTENING
TO THAT CONSTANT STREAM

09:27.100 --> 09:29.803
OF SEXUAL INNUENDO
ALL EVENING.

09:29.837 --> 09:30.904
AND FRANKLY,
I DIDN'T FIND THAT REMARK

09:30.938 --> 09:32.072
ABOUT PERFORMING
ON TED'S WEBSITE

09:32.105 --> 09:33.240
IN THE LEAST BIT AMUSING.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.977
- WAIT, I WASN'T SERIOUS.
CHRIST.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.712
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SUCH A PRUDE?

09:38.746 --> 09:40.681
- I'M NOT A PRUDE.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.651
- [laughs]
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE I AM.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.952
A LITTLE.
- A LITTLE.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.620
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE
SPREADING THEIR LEGS

09:46.654 --> 09:47.921
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
TO SEE.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.223
I KNOW IT EXISTS,
BUT THE IDEA OF ANYONE I KNOW

09:50.257 --> 09:52.693
BEING PART OF IT
REALLY BOTHERS ME.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.696
[sighs]
COME ON.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.335
[bell jingles]

10:02.369 --> 10:04.037
- * WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.372
- BACK SO SOON.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.174
DON'T TELL ME YOU WENT
THROUGH ALL THOSE COMICS

10:07.207 --> 10:08.942
I GAVE YOU ALREADY.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.644
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M PRETTY FAST.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.812
- OH.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.715
- I MEAN, I READ QUICKLY.
[both chuckling]

10:14.748 --> 10:17.284
UH, HATE WASTING TIME.
LIFE'S JUST TOO SHORT.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.386
YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS
WHAT COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW

10:19.419 --> 10:22.656
OR EVEN FIVE MINUTES
FROM NOW, RIGHT?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.024
- ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.392
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

10:25.425 --> 10:27.695
- UH, YEAH, I HOPE SO.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.398
UM, I SHOULD EXPLAIN.
MY NAME IS, UH, BEN.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.800
BEN BRUCKNER.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.703
- MICHAEL...NOVOTNY.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.670
- HEY, MICHAEL.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.739
UH, I TEACH GAY STUDIES
AT CARNEGIE MELLON.

10:38.772 --> 10:39.907
- I KNEW IT!

10:39.940 --> 10:41.274
- YOU KNEW WHAT?

10:41.308 --> 10:42.976
- WELL, WITH ALL THAT TALK
ABOUT CULTURAL REFERENCES,

10:43.010 --> 10:46.914
I KNEW YOU HAD TO BE...

10:46.947 --> 10:48.148
A PROFESSOR.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.751
- OH, OKAY.
WELL, ANYWAY,

10:50.784 --> 10:53.253
WE'RE EXPLORING HOMOEROTICISM
IN LITERATURE

10:53.286 --> 10:55.388
FROM GREEK AND...

10:55.422 --> 10:58.792
ROMAN MYTHOLOGY.
THANKS.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.428
UP TO AND INCLUDING
COMIC BOOK CULTURE--

11:01.461 --> 11:05.032
MODERN COMIC BOOK CULTURE,
SO I'M DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.367
- RESEARCH. RIGHT.
- MM-HMM.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.468
- GOT IT.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.204
UM, WELL, LET ME SEE
WHAT ELSE I CAN FIND FOR YOU.

11:11.238 --> 11:15.175
- ACTUALLY, I ALREADY FOUND
WHAT I WANT.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.811
- YEAH?
- MM-HMM. YOU.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.179
- ME?
- YEAH.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.048
I'D LIKE YOU TO COME
SPEAK TO MY CLASS.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.484
- [laughs]

11:24.517 --> 11:25.819
ABOUT WHAT?

11:25.853 --> 11:27.821
- WELL,
WHEN IT COMES TO COMICS,

11:27.855 --> 11:29.823
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
THE EXPERT, SO--

11:29.857 --> 11:31.491
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
IT'S JUST SOMETHING

11:31.524 --> 11:33.460
I KNOW ABOUT
SINCE I WAS A KID.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.963
- HMM. NO, NO, NO.
IT'S--

11:35.996 --> 11:38.799
IT'S DEFINITELY MORE THAN--
THAN KNOWING.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.168
WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT THEM, YOU--

11:41.201 --> 11:44.204
YOU HAVE A PASSION.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.975
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.977
WILL YOU COME?

11:53.947 --> 11:57.384
- UM, I'D LOVE TO COME.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.845
- CHECK IT OUT.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.114
I GOT A SECOND BOX OF PENNE
FREE WITH A COUPON.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.382
- YOU CLIP COUPONS?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.383
- YEAH.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.518
YOU CAN SAVE
A LOT OF MONEY.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.386
- I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE SO TIGHT.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.487
- SURE YOU DID.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.923
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE TWO BOXES

12:35.956 --> 12:39.960
OF PENNE BACK
AND GET ONE BOX OF RIGATONI?

12:39.993 --> 12:42.930
FUCK THE 50¢.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.434
AND BUY SOME CRISCO,
EVEN IF IT'S NOT ON SALE.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.270
- SEE THAT GUY?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.339
THAT'S BRIAN KINNEY.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.407
USED TO BE THE HOTTEST STUD
ON LIBERTY AVENUE.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.277
NOW,
HE'S IN A RELATIONSHIP.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.982
- [clicks tongue]

13:02.015 --> 13:04.852
- DID YOU INCLUDE
MY EXPENSES?

13:04.885 --> 13:05.785
- WHAT EXPENSES?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.021
- A BOTTLE OF KERI LOTION.
IT WAS $8.50.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.991
- OH, YOU HAVE A RECEIPT?

13:15.595 --> 13:18.899
UH, YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.135
OKAY, PERCENTAGE
OF TOTAL SUBSCRIBERS

13:22.169 --> 13:25.973
AND TIME ONLINE
ADDED TO YOUR BASE...

13:26.006 --> 13:28.909
COMES
TO A GRAND TOTAL OF...

13:32.312 --> 13:35.582
$18.72.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.616
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
I SPENT

13:36.649 --> 13:38.919
EIGHT HOURS WHACKING OFF
FOR $18?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.253
- A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IT
FOR FREE, YOU KNOW.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.154
- YEAH, YEAH,
BUT YOU SAID

13:41.188 --> 13:43.490
I WAS GOING TO MAKE, LIKE,
$500 A DAY.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.458
- THAT WAS BASED ON THIRD
QUARTER PROJECTED EARNINGS.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.595
- OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT THIS QUARTER?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.597
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU COMMIT

13:50.630 --> 13:53.333
TO A FLEDGLING ENTERPRISE,
IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT THE MONEY.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.336
IT'S ABOUT INVESTING IN
THE FUTURE AND NURTURING GROWTH.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.438
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TELL THAT
TO MY DICK, TED,

13:58.471 --> 14:00.107
BECAUSE IT'S WORN
TO A NUB.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.043
- WELL, I KNOW
A GOOD PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.377
- IS THAT COVERED
BY THE COMPANY HEALTH PLAN?

14:04.411 --> 14:05.913
- COMPANY HEALTH PLAN?

14:05.946 --> 14:08.181
- [scoffs, sniffs]

14:08.215 --> 14:10.450
WHAT ABOUT THE 401(k) YOU SAID
YOU WERE GOING TO OFFER?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.152
- OKAY.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.255
WELL, W-WE NEED
TO DISCUSS THAT.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.490
- YOU KNOW...

14:17.524 --> 14:21.594
I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE
IS JERKING ME AROUND.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.064
I QUIT.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.533
- BUT YOU'RE WALKING OUT
ON A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY HERE,

14:26.566 --> 14:31.271
BEING IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR
OF AN EXCITING, NEW...

14:31.304 --> 14:33.106
CREATIVE ENDEAVOR.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.242
[taps pencil]

14:35.275 --> 14:37.644
- MY ROOMMATES NEVER
PICK UP THEIR CLOTHES

14:37.677 --> 14:40.080
OR MAKE THEIR BED, OR--
OOH! WASH A DISH.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.182
- WE HAVE A CLEANING LADY,
COMES TWICE A WEEK.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.516
- YEAH, I HAVE TO WAIT
A HALF HOUR

14:43.550 --> 14:45.118
TO GET INTO THE BATHROOM,
AND WHEN I GET IN THERE,

14:45.152 --> 14:46.386
THERE'S NEVER
ANY HOT WATER LEFT.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.655
- WE SHOWER TOGETHER.
TO CONSERVE WATER.

14:48.688 --> 14:49.923
- [choking, laughing]

14:49.957 --> 14:53.526
THEY PLAY THEIR MUSIC SO LOUD,
I CAN'T EVEN HEAR MYSELF THINK.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.996
- THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.
- NO, IT'S WONDERFUL.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.231
[laughs]
- MM.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.400
I'M GLAD TO BE LIVING
WITH BRIAN.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.701
- DO YOU KNOW THAT MOSES--

15:01.734 --> 15:04.137
- [chuckles] YEAH, WELL,
DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.272
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
THAT'LL LAST.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.207
- MM. MM.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.442
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS,
BUT HE'S CHANGED.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.044
- MM.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.412
- LIKE TODAY.
[clears throat]

15:12.445 --> 15:14.614
THERE WAS THIS REALLY CUTE GUY
WITH A GOATEE

15:14.647 --> 15:16.549
AND A LEATHER JACKET
AT THE SHOP N' SAVE.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.419
NORMALLY, HE WOULD'VE LEFT ME
IN THE CHECKOUT LINE.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.121
THIS TIME,
BARELY EVEN LOOKED.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.422
- YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU WERE, THOUGH.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.456
[laughter]

15:23.490 --> 15:26.159
- OH, HERE.
- [laughs]

15:26.193 --> 15:28.561
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
I'M AT MY SEXUAL PEAK.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.631
FROM HERE ON IN,
IT IS ALL DOWNHILL.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.432
- [coughs]

15:32.465 --> 15:35.969
- DO YOU WANT ANY MORE?
- NO. NO.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.570
[laughs]

15:37.604 --> 15:39.106
[laughter]

15:39.139 --> 15:40.240
- SHH. SHH.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.343
- [giggling]

15:43.376 --> 15:46.446
[rock music]

15:46.479 --> 15:48.715
*

15:48.748 --> 15:52.085
- * HA HA HA HA

15:52.119 --> 15:57.624
*

15:57.657 --> 16:02.729
- [grunting]

16:02.762 --> 16:05.165
*

16:07.167 --> 16:09.369
- I TOLD YOU SO.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.071
I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.772
DIDN'T I TRY TO WARN HIM?

16:12.805 --> 16:13.773
"YOU NEED SOMETHING BIGGER,"
I SAID.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.008
DIDN'T I SAY THAT?

16:15.042 --> 16:18.078
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.346
- IF I DON'T COME UP
WITH SOMETHING QUICK,

16:19.379 --> 16:22.149
I'M GOING TO LOSE MY CONDO,
MY CAR...

16:22.182 --> 16:23.783
MY ASS.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.153
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING NOW.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.387
NO ONE EVER LISTENS.
I...

16:27.420 --> 16:29.189
MIGHT AS WELL BE
THE INVISIBLE MAN.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.392
OR WORSE, WORSE, A MIME.
MIME.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.496
- THEY SAY YOU SHOULD, UH,
START A SPEECH WITH A JOKE.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.597
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.366
HOW CAN YOU TELL
IF A SUPERHERO IS GAY?

16:39.399 --> 16:41.734
HIS BOOTS
MATCH HIS PURSE.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.071
- [laughs]

16:44.104 --> 16:45.072
THAT'S FUNNY.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.407
- NOT FUNNY.
- IT STINKS.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.379
- OKAY, IS NO ONE GOING
TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY PRESENCE?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.382
- PASS THE JAM.
- WILL YOU PASS THE CREAM?

16:58.551 --> 17:00.487
[both chuckling]

17:00.520 --> 17:02.722
- HE NEVER LISTENS.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.557
- OKAY, GET 'EM UP, BOYS.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.593
YOUR COFFEE CUPS,
THAT IS.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.828
MM.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.197
HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.231

17:11.264 --> 17:12.532

17:20.107 --> 17:21.441
- FLOP.
SINKER.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.210
MY LIFE'S
A BREAKFAST COMBO.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.646
- TWO EGGS, A DOUGHNUT,

17:26.679 --> 17:28.281
SOMEBODY GOT LUCKY
LAST NIGHT, HUH?

17:28.315 --> 17:29.716
- MM-HMM.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.852

IN COMIC BOOKS.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.722
"THE MALE FORM

- WHAT'S HE DOING?

17:39.559 --> 17:40.827
- WHAT AM I DOING?

17:40.860 --> 17:43.563
- WHAT'S HE DOING?
MICHAEL'S GIVING A LECTURE AT--

17:43.596 --> 17:47.100

THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING!

MWAH!

17:49.602 --> 17:51.404
- I'M IMPRESSED, MIKEY.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.507
NEXT, YOU'LL BE RECEIVING
YOUR HONORARY DOCTORATE.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.443
- I DON'T THINK SO.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.245
ESPECIALLY SINCE
THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER COME

17:58.278 --> 18:00.347
TO HIGHER EDUCATION
IS WHEN I FUCKED THAT, UH,

18:00.380 --> 18:02.849
TEXTBOOK SALESMAN
FROM CLEVELAND.

- WELL, ACCORDING
TO MY CALCULATIONS,

18:05.218 --> 18:08.755
I'VE GOT JUST ABOUT ENOUGH MONEY
LEFT FOR MY FUNERAL.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.158
- DON'T ASK ME
TO DELIVER THE EULOGY.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.326
NO ONE WOULD LISTEN.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.328
- HMM?

18:15.362 --> 18:17.597
- DEB, MY BREAKFAST?

18:17.630 --> 18:20.600
- WORKING ON IT.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.436
- MORNING, SUNSHINE.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.606
[clears throat]
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

18:26.639 --> 18:28.908
- UH, YEAH.
COME TO THINK OF IT.

18:43.490 --> 18:47.327
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER TEACH YOU
TO CROSS ON THE GREEN?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.528
- WHAT DID HE DO NOW?

18:48.561 --> 18:49.596
- NOTHING.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.531
- CUT THE SHIT.
I KNOW THAT FACE.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.234
THAT'S THE "BRIAN KINNEY
JUST FUCKED ME" FACE.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.503
- YEAH, EXCEPT IT WASN'T ME
HE WAS FUCKING.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.904
IT WAS SOME OTHER GUY.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.939
I COME HOME.
HE'S ON THE FUCKING COUCH.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.741
- ANOTHER HURRICANE
OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA,

19:01.774 --> 19:04.411
ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE IN PERU.
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

19:04.444 --> 19:06.913
- I-I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT
THAT NOW THAT WE'RE TOGETHER--

19:06.946 --> 19:09.882
- THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT.
BRIAN IS NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.184
YOU KNOW THAT.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.386

42:00.218 --> 42:03.722
[laughs]

42:03.755 --> 42:06.892
- "TO CHRISTOPHER."

42:06.925 --> 42:09.194
- "TO...

42:09.227 --> 42:12.698
"CHRISTOPHER.

42:12.731 --> 42:15.601
"THANKS FOR BEING

[laughs]

42:54.840 --> 42:56.942
- MY LITTLE STAR!

42:56.975 --> 42:58.910
[laughter]

42:58.944 --> 43:01.747
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET YOU A PORN NAME.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.849
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH EMMETT HONEYCUTT?

43:03.882 --> 43:05.984
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
PORN LORE HAS IT,

43:06.017 --> 43:09.254
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
THE NAME OF YOUR CHILDHOOD PET

43:09.287 --> 43:12.991
AND ADD THE NAME OF THE STREET
YOU GREW UP ON.

43:13.024 --> 43:16.127
- WELL, BACK IN HAZELHURST,
WE HAD A LOT OF PETS.

43:16.161 --> 43:20.799
OH, BUT, UM, MY FAVORITE WAS
THIS LITTLE MUTT NAMED FETCH.

43:20.832 --> 43:22.100
- [chuckles]
AND THE STREET?

43:22.133 --> 43:26.972
- WE LIVED AT THE CORNER
OF MASON AND DIXON.

43:27.005 --> 43:29.107
- "FETCH DIXON."

43:29.140 --> 43:31.142
A STAR IS...PORN.

43:31.176 --> 43:32.343
[laughter]

43:32.377 --> 43:35.213
- FETCH DIXON.

[panting]

44:51.522 --> 44:54.793
[deep sigh]

44:54.826 --> 44:55.994
- I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T LIKE PORN.

44:56.027 --> 44:59.931
- OH, GOD.

44:59.965 --> 45:03.334
LOOK...

45:03.368 --> 45:06.104
I DON'T.

45:08.073 --> 45:11.376
AND I LIKE EVEN LESS THINKING
ABOUT ALL THOSE STRANGE MEN

45:11.409 --> 45:14.479
AND PROBABLY EVEN A FEW WOMEN
LOOKING AT YOU.

45:14.512 --> 45:17.382
- IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO
BEFORE I KNEW YOU.

45:17.415 --> 45:19.350
- WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
TELL ME?

45:19.384 --> 45:22.087
- IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I REALLY WANTED TO BOAST ABOUT.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.255
I PRACTICALLY
FORGOT ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW.

45:24.289 --> 45:27.959
- I DON'T LIKE US
HAVING ANY SECRETS.

45:27.993 --> 45:31.362
THERE AREN'T ANY MORE,
ARE THERE?

45:31.396 --> 45:34.966
- MM.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.401
I SWEAR.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.037
[both giggling]

45:39.070 --> 45:40.505
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

45:40.538 --> 45:44.042
- WELL, THERE WAS THAT TIME
THAT I WAS A HOOKER IN ALASKA.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.376
- [laughs]

45:45.410 --> 45:47.112
- BUT THAT WAS
ONLY A SUMMER JOB.

45:47.145 --> 45:48.914
[laughter]

45:48.947 --> 45:50.515
- AHH!

45:50.548 --> 45:53.218
AH.

45:53.251 --> 45:59.190
[moaning]

46:01.893 --> 46:07.899
[giggling]

46:12.337 --> 46:14.205
I USED TO HAVE
A PRETTY HOT BOD.

46:14.239 --> 46:15.841
- YOU STILL DO.
[slapping]

46:15.874 --> 46:17.508
- [gasps]
- MMM.

46:17.542 --> 46:22.547
- WHY SETTLE FOR A MAGAZINE WHEN
YOU CAN HAVE THE REAL THING?

46:22.580 --> 46:27.252
[moaning]

46:27.285 --> 46:30.255
[techno music]

46:30.288 --> 46:38.229

46:51.576 --> 46:53.044
- HEY.

46:53.078 --> 46:55.914
- HEY.
- HEY, FUCK OFF.

46:55.947 --> 46:59.584
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

46:59.617 --> 47:02.053
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

47:02.087 --> 47:03.388
THE REASON I TOOK YOU IN

47:03.421 --> 47:07.458
WAS BECAUSE YOU TOOK
A BAT TO THE HEAD.

47:07.492 --> 47:11.930
BUT IT'S NOT THE REASON
I WANT YOU TO STAY.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.464
BUT...

47:13.498 --> 47:15.233
DON'T GET THE IDEA
THAT WE'RE SOME MARRIED COUPLE

47:15.266 --> 47:17.068
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT.

47:17.102 --> 47:21.206
WE'RE NOT LIKE
FUCKING STRAIGHT PEOPLE.

47:21.239 --> 47:22.908
WE'RE NOT
LIKE YOUR PARENTS,

47:22.941 --> 47:25.176
AND WE'RE NOT A PAIR OF DYKES
MARCHING DOWN THE AISLE

47:25.210 --> 47:29.047
IN MATCHING VERA WANGS.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.215
WE'RE QUEERS,
AND IF WE'RE TOGETHER,

47:30.248 --> 47:31.382
IT'S BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE,

47:31.416 --> 47:34.319
NOT BECAUSE THERE'S LOCKS
ON OUR DOORS.

47:34.352 --> 47:36.187
SO IF I'M OUT LATE,
JUST ASSUME I'M DOING

47:36.221 --> 47:39.925
EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO BE DOING:
I'M FUCKING.

47:39.958 --> 47:42.460
AND...
WHEN I COME HOME,

47:42.493 --> 47:47.198
I'LL ALSO BE DOING
EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO DO:

47:47.232 --> 47:50.902
COMING HOME TO YOU.

47:50.936 --> 47:53.204
- OKAY.

47:53.238 --> 47:56.141
I WANT SOME THINGS TOO.

47:56.174 --> 48:00.478
YOU CAN FUCK WHOEVER YOU WANT,
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TWICE.

48:00.511 --> 48:03.114
SAME FOR ME.

48:03.148 --> 48:06.184
AND NO NAMES
OR NUMBERS EXCHANGED.

48:10.255 --> 48:13.391
AND NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

48:13.424 --> 48:17.162
YOU ALWAYS COME HOME.

48:17.195 --> 48:18.396
BY 2:00.

48:18.429 --> 48:20.966
- 4:00.

48:20.999 --> 48:24.302
- 3:00.
ONE MORE THING.

48:24.335 --> 48:27.472
YOU DON'T KISS ANYONE ELSE
ON THE MOUTH BUT ME.

48:27.505 --> 48:35.446
*

48:53.064 --> 48:55.200
- HERE YOU GO.

48:55.233 --> 48:57.468
- THANKS.

48:57.502 --> 49:01.206
- OH, GOT SOMETHING ELSE
FOR YOU HERE.

49:01.239 --> 49:03.274
- "R-U-1-2."

49:03.308 --> 49:05.043
R-U-1-2?
OH, I GET IT.

49:05.076 --> 49:07.612
YOU WROTE THIS?
YOU WROTE A BOOK?

49:07.645 --> 49:12.350
- YES, YES. IT'S MY FIRST,
AND SO FAR, ONLY NOVEL.

49:12.383 --> 49:13.751
THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER
CALLED IT

49:13.784 --> 49:16.621
"A NOBLE EFFORT
FROM A FRESH NEW VOICE."

49:16.654 --> 49:19.357
IT WAS ON THE REMAINDERS TABLE
A WEEK LATER.

49:19.390 --> 49:21.359
[laughs]

49:21.392 --> 49:25.496
- I NEVER MET ANYBODY
WHO'S WRITTEN A BOOK BEFORE.

49:25.530 --> 49:27.632
- OPEN IT.

49:32.103 --> 49:33.738

BEN."

49:46.484 --> 49:49.420
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

49:56.361 --> 49:59.297
- NO WORDS REQUIRED.

50:02.833 --> 50:06.037
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

50:37.868 --> 50:39.770
- WAIT.

50:39.804 --> 50:42.240
WAIT, HEY, HEY.
I SAID WAIT. I SAID WAIT.

50:42.273 --> 50:45.143
MICHAEL.

50:45.176 --> 50:48.146
- WHAT FOR?
