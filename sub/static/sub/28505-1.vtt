WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:06.270
- Of such idle stockpiles,

00:06.270 --> 00:09.570
which can only destroy and never create

00:09.570 --> 00:13.730
is not the only, much
less the most efficient

00:13.730 --> 00:15.363
means of assuring peace.

00:16.290 --> 00:18.620
I speak of peace therefore,

00:18.620 --> 00:23.620
as the necessary, rational
end of rational men.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.650
- They will be met with fire and fury

00:26.650 --> 00:28.950
like the world has never seen.

00:28.950 --> 00:32.660
- Why have we not been able
to get together as a nation?

00:32.660 --> 00:35.110
- Donald Trump says he
admires Vladimir Putin.

00:35.110 --> 00:38.880
- There is no collusion
between me, and my campaign,

00:38.880 --> 00:40.090
and the Russians.

00:40.090 --> 00:40.923
- The trouble with our liberal friends

00:40.923 --> 00:42.470
is not that they're ignorant,

00:42.470 --> 00:44.810
it's just that they know
so much that isn't so.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.710
- Politics of division and resentment,

00:46.710 --> 00:49.690
and paranoia has
unfortunately found a home

00:49.690 --> 00:50.620
in the Republican Party.

00:50.620 --> 00:53.910
- To get that son of a bitch
off the field, right now.

00:53.910 --> 00:56.850
Out, he's fired.
(crowd cheering)

00:56.850 --> 00:58.460
Fired!

00:58.460 --> 00:59.700
- Yes, we should deport them.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.690
We should build a wall.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.210
We should triple the border patrol.

01:02.210 --> 01:04.290
- I think there's blame on both sides.

01:04.290 --> 01:06.800
- He will be the voice
of all us outsiders,

01:06.800 --> 01:09.700
all us deplorables, all of us losers,

01:09.700 --> 01:11.750
all of us morons.

01:11.750 --> 01:15.090
- What difference at
this point does it make?

01:15.090 --> 01:18.558
- Which is why I alone can fix it.

01:18.558 --> 01:22.558
(rapidly increasing heart beat)

01:25.450 --> 01:30.219
(hard rock instrumental of
"The Star-Spangled Banner")

01:30.219 --> 01:35.219
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

01:53.118 --> 01:54.779
- Hey.

01:54.779 --> 01:56.238
Hello!

01:56.238 --> 01:57.556
Yes.

01:57.556 --> 01:59.446
I just wanna thank you.

01:59.446 --> 02:00.798
How's it going, man?

02:00.798 --> 02:02.297
Hey, yes!

02:02.297 --> 02:03.180
Yes.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.970
Arizona, it's 115 degrees.

02:05.970 --> 02:07.097
Holy shit.

02:07.097 --> 02:08.680
(audience laughing)

02:08.680 --> 02:10.620
- I am doing my new show, guys.

02:10.620 --> 02:12.250
I wanted to write a show

02:12.250 --> 02:13.640
that was gonna bring the country together,

02:13.640 --> 02:14.680
something we could all laugh about,

02:14.680 --> 02:16.660
so it's about politics,
guns, and abortion.

02:16.660 --> 02:17.591
There you go.

02:17.591 --> 02:18.424
(audience cheering)

02:18.424 --> 02:19.257
Yes!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.470
Talking about politics
in America right now

02:22.470 --> 02:25.743
is like trying to organize an
interracial hoedown in 1840.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.340
I say, are you an abolitionist
or you Dred Scott?

02:29.340 --> 02:30.720
Well, take off the Nat Turner tee-shirt

02:30.720 --> 02:33.070
or there shall be
fisticuffs, you carpetbagger.

02:34.510 --> 02:35.700
Yeah, joke number two sounds

02:35.700 --> 02:37.700
like history homework, doesn't it, yeah.

02:38.730 --> 02:40.640
Here's what bothered me
about the last election.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.120
I could not believe we
were fighting each other

02:44.120 --> 02:45.563
over these idiots.

02:46.780 --> 02:47.790
Like, half of us wanted

02:47.790 --> 02:49.490
this arrogant pantsuit-wearing robot.

02:49.490 --> 02:50.766
I call her She-3PO.

02:50.766 --> 02:52.530
(audience laughing)

02:52.530 --> 02:55.010
And ladies why was she
wearing those square jackets?

02:55.010 --> 02:56.894
Was she running as Lego Hillary?

02:56.894 --> 02:59.894
(audience laughing)

03:01.090 --> 03:02.230
And then the other half wanted

03:02.230 --> 03:03.590
this arrogant, orange, delusional,

03:03.590 --> 03:05.663
Alzheimer's-ridden rodeo clown.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.546
And that's why we were pissed at each?

03:09.546 --> 03:11.420
People who are families were breaking up.

03:11.420 --> 03:13.020
You guys do get that we get a new idiot

03:13.020 --> 03:15.020
in four years, right?

03:15.020 --> 03:17.583
You're gonna need your
family to wipe you in 20.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.680
Like, families are breaking
up with Thanksgiving.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.090
Is that who you voted for, Uncle Phil?

03:23.090 --> 03:24.830
Is that who you, shut
the fuck up, Grandma!

03:24.830 --> 03:27.288
Is that who you voted for, Uncle Phil?

03:27.288 --> 03:28.310
Well, if that's who you voted for,

03:28.310 --> 03:29.940
hell, I hope you get hit by a gas truck.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.540
That's right, Uncle Phil,
and I hope you don't die.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.080
I hope you're lyin' there
and the truck driver's

03:33.080 --> 03:35.350
gotta revive you, but
he's got Ebola and AIDS.

03:35.350 --> 03:37.100
That's what I hope happens, Uncle Phil.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.110
I hope you get truck-driver Ebola.

03:39.110 --> 03:40.660
Shut the fuck up, Grandma!

03:40.660 --> 03:41.493
Hey.

03:43.655 --> 03:45.440
I am not gonna shut up.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.533
Uncle Phil gave you a kidney last year.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.793
You want your Nazi
kidney back, Uncle Phil?

03:52.920 --> 03:54.210
Someone get me a box cutter

03:54.210 --> 03:55.910
and some bathtub bourbon right now!

03:55.910 --> 03:56.910
Yeah!

03:56.910 --> 03:57.960
I'm gonna cut this kidney out.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.710
I'm gonna go pee first, Uncle Phil.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.300
I couldn't believe how we
were treating each other.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.640
And then this morning, I woke up happy

04:06.640 --> 04:08.140
'cause I realized the comet

04:08.140 --> 04:09.800
that's gonna destroy Humanity

04:09.800 --> 04:11.183
is already on its way.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.520
Oh, there's a giant rock coming, people.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.960
Oh, yeah, it's happened
five times in the past,

04:15.960 --> 04:16.793
destroyed everything.

04:16.793 --> 04:18.520
It's not God, God's
not flippin' that rock.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.900
Oh, you guys keep dancing on Sunday,

04:19.900 --> 04:22.203
I'm gonna jack this place up.

04:23.410 --> 04:24.670
You guys better start having sex

04:24.670 --> 04:25.790
through a hole in a sheet again

04:25.790 --> 04:28.173
or I'm gonna blow torch this place.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.326
Only the Mormons are
gonna survive this shit.

04:31.326 --> 04:33.966
(audience applauding)
(audience laughing)

04:33.966 --> 04:34.799
No.

04:37.673 --> 04:38.830
There is!

04:38.830 --> 04:42.150
There is actually a giant rock
in space right now in orbit,

04:42.150 --> 04:43.680
and one day is gonna pound into the Earth,

04:43.680 --> 04:45.170
and when it hits, it's gonna destroy

04:45.170 --> 04:48.356
a million species instantly and Kanye.

04:48.356 --> 04:52.106
(audience cheering)

04:52.106 --> 04:53.361
I get it.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.897
I know he earned it.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.370
Then it's gonna set
the atmosphere on fire,

04:57.370 --> 04:58.597
and that's gonna burn until
almost all of us are gone,

04:58.597 --> 04:59.790
and the survivors are gonna have

04:59.790 --> 05:02.120
to live in an impact winter for an eon,

05:02.120 --> 05:04.400
till there's only three of us left:

05:04.400 --> 05:06.209
two guys and a girl.

05:06.209 --> 05:07.320
(audience whooping)

05:07.320 --> 05:08.850
And you think they're
gonna restart humanity,

05:08.850 --> 05:10.333
but no, both guys are gay.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.780
So, they're gonna kill the girl for food

05:14.780 --> 05:16.130
and steal her skinny jeans.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.760
And then slowly make their
way to Boca Raton, Florida

05:22.800 --> 05:24.780
where they're gonna live
out their final gay days

05:24.780 --> 05:27.600
wearing Speedos and shimmying
to Katy Perry dance mixes

05:29.210 --> 05:30.543
on a solar-powered iPod.

05:32.870 --> 05:34.210
And when the last game man dies,

05:34.210 --> 05:35.270
that'll be at for Humanity.

05:35.270 --> 05:38.920
Everything we have done,
everything we have built, gone,

05:38.920 --> 05:41.220
just another grain of
sand in an empty universe

05:41.220 --> 05:42.370
full of useless effort.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.327
And that's how I'm dealing
with the election (chuckles).

05:49.150 --> 05:50.870
Oh, come on, you know it was a bad one

05:50.870 --> 05:54.260
when a planet-killing meteor
is my optimistic plan.

05:54.260 --> 05:56.630
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

05:56.630 --> 05:57.850
Oh, come on!

05:57.850 --> 05:59.350
I don't care what side you're on,

05:59.350 --> 06:02.040
and by the way, there's
only one side: American.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.575
That's the only side there is.

06:04.575 --> 06:09.575
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

06:09.880 --> 06:12.840
But the last four people
running for president, my God.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.410
I could've picked four better candidates

06:14.410 --> 06:15.500
by just throwing a tennis ball

06:15.500 --> 06:17.613
into a severe trauma brain injury award.

06:19.030 --> 06:19.863
Just chuck it in,

06:19.863 --> 06:22.230
whoever goes, ball, and
giggles, you're our candidate.

06:22.230 --> 06:23.063
Come on out.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.090
You got a good attitude.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.963
You knew what a fuckin' ball was.

06:29.570 --> 06:31.043
Come on, let's admit it.

06:31.043 --> 06:32.493
Ted Cruz?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.677
Ted Cruz?

06:33.677 --> 06:35.177
- Whoa!
- Ted Cruz!

06:36.640 --> 06:40.230
Every man in this room
knows a guy like Ted Cruz,

06:40.230 --> 06:42.140
who just roams the
Earth with this sentence

06:42.140 --> 06:43.650
constantly playing in his head:

06:43.650 --> 06:45.290
no one's gonna wipe a booger on me again,

06:45.290 --> 06:47.390
no one's gonna wipe a booger on me again.

06:47.390 --> 06:48.936
And if they do, I'm gonna tattle.

06:48.936 --> 06:49.769
Nyah!

06:53.456 --> 06:55.380
Then you had Hillary, who's
got this wake of bodies

06:55.380 --> 06:56.723
behind her, allegedly.

06:58.118 --> 06:58.951
Allegedly!

07:00.210 --> 07:03.030
Allegedly, I'm sayin' allegedly
'cause I don't wanna die

07:03.030 --> 07:04.680
in a suspicious one-car accident.

07:05.794 --> 07:09.564
(audience applauding)

07:09.564 --> 07:10.764
I know.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.066
Yeah.
(audience cheering)

07:13.066 --> 07:14.643
I know.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.070
They're gonna find me an empty parking lot

07:17.070 --> 07:18.493
leaning against my car door,

07:19.400 --> 07:21.703
trunk carpet fibers all over my body,

07:22.560 --> 07:25.253
suicide note written in
a language I don't speak.

07:26.350 --> 07:27.183
Allegedly.

07:27.183 --> 07:28.023
Allegedly!

07:30.210 --> 07:31.690
And then you had Trump,
who was pretty amazing.

07:31.690 --> 07:33.880
He made it to the entire election

07:33.880 --> 07:37.810
without finishing a fucking sentence.

07:37.810 --> 07:38.643
It was insane.

07:38.643 --> 07:40.580
Wrong, didn't happen,
beautiful, best ever,

07:40.580 --> 07:41.853
reciprocal.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.750
Nobody peed on me.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.240
Oh, oh, oh, that was almost a sentence.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.183
Nice job, dude.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.050
Yeah, we have a president

07:50.050 --> 07:51.390
with no military experience

07:51.390 --> 07:54.113
and no political experience,
but he has jazz hands.

07:55.521 --> 07:59.198
♪ When you're a Jet,
you're a Jet all the way ♪

07:59.198 --> 08:00.480
What is that?

08:02.463 --> 08:04.370
And I have to be honest.

08:04.370 --> 08:05.810
I feel bad for you Trump people

08:05.810 --> 08:07.150
'cause you know damn well every time

08:07.150 --> 08:09.260
that man heads towards a microphone,

08:09.260 --> 08:11.030
you have anxiety, don't you?

08:11.030 --> 08:13.758
(audience laughing)

08:13.758 --> 08:16.310
And man, how many teleprompter guys

08:16.310 --> 08:20.340
have shot themself in the
face working with that dude?

08:20.340 --> 08:21.810
'Cause he's on the speech for a minute.

08:21.810 --> 08:22.810
He's like, he's on the speech.

08:22.810 --> 08:23.643
He's on the speech.

08:23.643 --> 08:24.476
He's on the speech.

08:24.476 --> 08:25.918
And then, oh, my God, he's gonna improv.

08:25.918 --> 08:26.751
No!

08:28.046 --> 08:31.857
(imitates gunfire banging)

08:31.857 --> 08:33.020
And then you had Bernie; I like Bernie.

08:33.020 --> 08:34.060
I thought Bernie was cool.

08:34.060 --> 08:35.913
At the end, at the end, though,

08:37.050 --> 08:38.430
at the end though, after
all that crap, though,

08:38.430 --> 08:39.280
didn't Bernie come across

08:39.280 --> 08:41.380
like a real grumpy model train enthusiast?

08:43.121 --> 08:43.954
Couldn't you just see him

08:43.954 --> 08:44.787
in the basement of the White House?

08:44.787 --> 08:45.620
Toot toot.

08:50.050 --> 08:51.760
Mr. President, Vladimir
Putin's on the phone.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.360
I told you don't bother me

08:55.030 --> 08:56.630
when I'm playing with my trains.

08:58.270 --> 08:59.690
This job takes up all my time.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.663
I'd like to keep 1%, thank you.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.990
And I had friends get crazy, too.

09:05.990 --> 09:06.890
I had friends, after the election,

09:06.890 --> 09:07.980
they got real fatalistic.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.457
They just started yelling crazy stuff.

09:09.457 --> 09:10.530
They're like, good, you know what?

09:10.530 --> 09:12.090
I'm glad the insane guy won.

09:12.090 --> 09:12.923
Good.

09:12.923 --> 09:15.022
Let's just burn it down
and start over, man.

09:15.022 --> 09:15.855
Good.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.702
Let's just nuke the whole
thing and begin again.

09:17.702 --> 09:18.535
Woo!

09:24.090 --> 09:25.683
As fun as that sounds,

09:27.520 --> 09:29.820
I don't think it's gonna
go the way you think.

09:30.810 --> 09:32.260
Do you know why people
say stupid crap like that?

09:32.260 --> 09:33.883
Those damn Road Warrior movies.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.380
Yeah, we think we're
gonna survive Armageddon.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.770
In fact, every man in
this room, right now,

09:39.770 --> 09:42.254
believes he's gonna be
Mad Max in the apocalypse.

09:42.254 --> 09:43.880
(men cheering)

09:43.880 --> 09:45.795
Every single one.

09:45.795 --> 09:46.694
Yeah.

09:46.694 --> 09:48.440
Oh, yeah, I got seven guns

09:48.440 --> 09:50.070
and a case of Clif Bars, follow me.

09:50.070 --> 09:50.970
Come on, let's go.

09:52.620 --> 09:53.453
Well, hold on.

09:53.453 --> 09:54.460
I gotta tweet my followers.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.863
Let me tweet my followers.

09:57.454 --> 09:59.950
Yeah, 'cause in 2018, (wheezy gasping),

09:59.950 --> 10:02.953
we all have followers just like Jesus.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.373
Did they help you move?

10:09.240 --> 10:10.793
Did they lie for you in court?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.044
Then they ain't followers, are they?

10:14.044 --> 10:17.012
(audience applauding)

10:17.012 --> 10:17.845
It's crazy.

10:17.845 --> 10:21.128
You guys...
(audience whooping)

10:21.128 --> 10:23.570
You guys do realize what
these phones have done

10:23.570 --> 10:25.100
to us now, selfie, selfie, selfie.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.490
Is it any surprise we elected

10:26.490 --> 10:28.873
the most narcissistic
human being on the planet?

10:28.873 --> 10:30.650
Selfie, selfie, selfie.

10:30.650 --> 10:31.620
Get some damn friends.

10:31.620 --> 10:32.820
Take some them-ies and us-ies.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.740
Come on, goddammit.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.213
Take more we-sies.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.030
You get who we are now, right?

10:40.030 --> 10:43.530
We now take pictures of ourselves

10:43.530 --> 10:45.593
to send to people we don't know,

10:46.740 --> 10:48.473
to see what they think about us.

10:49.890 --> 10:52.413
Did you get that picture
of me that I took of me?

10:55.250 --> 10:57.903
It's on my Instagram under
Christopher Titus dot me.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.623
Please comment,

11:02.820 --> 11:03.743
on me.

11:05.510 --> 11:06.803
Like me.

11:08.090 --> 11:09.113
Follow me.

11:11.701 --> 11:12.534
You know who does that?

11:12.534 --> 11:14.593
Psychopaths, that's who does that.

11:15.670 --> 11:19.100
And by the way, yeah, if you
wanna follow me on Twitter

11:19.100 --> 11:20.800
it's @TitusNation.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.780
(audience applauding)

11:22.780 --> 11:27.780
Or The Real Christopher Titus on Facebook.

11:32.010 --> 11:33.580
Those road, and by the way, gentleman,

11:33.580 --> 11:35.010
you don't wanna be Mad Max.

11:35.010 --> 11:36.680
Mad Max is always half a criminal.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.580
He's always busted up.

11:37.580 --> 11:38.420
Looks like Rob Zombie

11:38.420 --> 11:41.363
after a bad white water
rafting accident, you know?

11:41.363 --> 11:42.870
He's always got a leg brace,

11:42.870 --> 11:45.350
am eye patch made out of his old kneecap.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.410
He's got a hole blown through his head

11:47.410 --> 11:49.920
that he stuffed with a booby-trap grenade

11:49.920 --> 11:50.753
so when he gets caught,

11:50.753 --> 11:51.920
he can say cool things like,

11:51.920 --> 11:52.870
go ahead, pull the pin.

11:52.870 --> 11:54.220
You'll blow both our minds.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.740
He's got some weird Armageddon dune buggy

11:58.740 --> 12:00.360
with metal sticking off of it,

12:00.360 --> 12:01.500
some drifter changed to it,

12:01.500 --> 12:03.970
following him through the wasteland.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.360
Oh, the guy can't ride in the dune buggy

12:05.360 --> 12:08.020
'cause Mad Max's dog sits
in the passenger seat,

12:08.020 --> 12:10.630
his two-legged dog that they
haven't Killed for food yet

12:10.630 --> 12:12.070
'cause it's still got
one good front left leg

12:12.070 --> 12:13.160
and one good right back leg

12:13.160 --> 12:16.143
so it balances like a shitty
table at a Chinese restaurant.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.303
I want that dog, honestly.

12:22.410 --> 12:23.610
I think those Road Warrior movies,

12:23.610 --> 12:26.170
I think they're trying to
get us ready for Armageddon

12:26.170 --> 12:28.690
and how come everybody has a cool haircut

12:28.690 --> 12:29.713
in the apocalypse?

12:30.950 --> 12:33.260
All those movies, we can't
find clean drinking water

12:33.260 --> 12:35.063
but everybody gets a Mohawk,

12:36.680 --> 12:39.660
or spikes, or shaved with your name in it.

12:39.660 --> 12:42.150
So Army Rangers and Navy
Seals didn't make it

12:42.150 --> 12:45.153
through the apocalypse but
somehow stylists pulled it off?

12:48.739 --> 12:49.930
I was at the shampoo station.

12:49.930 --> 12:50.763
I heard a noise.

12:50.763 --> 12:51.596
I hid under a desk.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.130
I don't know what happened.

12:55.510 --> 12:57.088
Now I'm chained to this
asshole's dune buggy.

12:57.088 --> 12:57.921
I don't get this at all.

12:57.921 --> 12:58.754
What are we doing?

13:01.647 --> 13:04.030
And that last Road
Warrior movie, Fury Road?

13:04.030 --> 13:05.480
Fury Road aside, gentlemen,

13:05.480 --> 13:08.233
there are no hot babes in the apocalypse.

13:09.336 --> 13:10.169
-  Now...

13:10.169 --> 13:12.300
- Oh no, all the skinny hot
chicks died of malnutrition,

13:12.300 --> 13:14.248
lack of moisturizer, and ChapStick.

13:14.248 --> 13:15.808
(audience cheering)

13:15.808 --> 13:16.776
That's right.

13:16.776 --> 13:21.330
And all that's left is those
tube-titty bison females

13:21.330 --> 13:24.950
that used to roam the
cheese aisle at Walmart.

13:24.950 --> 13:26.050
And they're not around either.

13:26.050 --> 13:27.040
They're looked in in a room somewhere,

13:27.040 --> 13:29.623
getting milked to feed the bad guy's kids.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.323
Did you see the movie?

13:36.200 --> 13:38.223
'Cause that scene is in the movie.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.340
So, now when you watch the
movie, you're gonna giggle.

13:44.294 --> 13:45.840
When I saw it, I didn't have me,

13:45.840 --> 13:47.290
so I went (guttural gagging).

13:54.040 --> 13:55.107
That movie pissed me off,

13:55.107 --> 13:58.280
and so in the middle of
the apocalyptic wasteland,

13:58.280 --> 14:01.723
four smoking hot runway models show up?

14:02.694 --> 14:04.533
That does it even happened in porn.

14:07.283 --> 14:08.140
And they're all beautiful,

14:08.140 --> 14:09.050
Their makeup's perfect.

14:09.050 --> 14:09.883
They're well-adjusted.

14:09.883 --> 14:10.716
They all get along,

14:10.716 --> 14:12.053
Well, now I know it's a movie.

14:14.403 --> 14:15.900
They're all wearing hemp butt-thongs,

14:15.900 --> 14:17.080
barely raped at all.

14:17.080 --> 14:17.913
Come on!

14:20.210 --> 14:22.410
In the apocalypse?

14:22.410 --> 14:23.600
Let me be very clear.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.433
I love women.

14:24.433 --> 14:27.059
I think women are by far the better sex.

14:27.059 --> 14:30.667
(audience whooping)
I think they are, yes.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.500
But...

14:32.770 --> 14:35.917
In the apocalypse there's
gonna be some rapin'.

14:38.841 --> 14:40.230
And I know sometimes I'm gonna be

14:40.230 --> 14:41.720
on the weeping side of that raping.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.553
I know that.

14:44.059 --> 14:45.257
I know that.

14:45.257 --> 14:47.583
You can't look like this
and not expect that.

14:49.779 --> 14:50.612
I know.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.230
I know, sir, my mouth is gorgeous.

14:54.230 --> 14:57.630
I know!

15:00.937 --> 15:05.420
And how are you Millennials
gonna survive the apocalypse?

15:05.420 --> 15:07.161
There's no app.

15:07.161 --> 15:09.561
(audience laughing)

15:09.561 --> 15:10.394
Yeah.

15:10.394 --> 15:13.240
Millennials hate that joke, really.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.073
Shut up, I'll be fine.

15:14.073 --> 15:15.690
I do what I always do, man.

15:15.690 --> 15:17.440
Get up, get my 2/3 decaf latte,

15:17.440 --> 15:18.540
trim my lumberjack beard,

15:18.540 --> 15:20.240
call an Uber and make it, brother.

15:22.197 --> 15:23.797
My mom said I could be anything.

15:25.057 --> 15:27.937
And I got a participation
trophy to prove that.

15:27.937 --> 15:32.810
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

15:32.810 --> 15:33.660
Yeah (chuckling).

15:35.730 --> 15:37.690
A lot of you Millennials
can barely light a candle

15:37.690 --> 15:39.263
let alone change a tire.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.350
How the hell are you gonna
distill drinking water

15:42.350 --> 15:43.940
from a rusted hot tub your dead neighbor

15:43.940 --> 15:44.990
is still floating in?

15:47.710 --> 15:49.490
You can't cook and eat
your girlfriend's Shitzu

15:49.490 --> 15:50.990
if the microwave doesn't work.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.710
Doesn't even beep anymore.

15:54.710 --> 15:55.918
You better get on the internet.

15:55.918 --> 16:00.918
(horrified gasping) There's no internet!

16:01.080 --> 16:04.530
So, can we all stop talking
about burning our country down

16:04.530 --> 16:05.830
'cause it's getting this crazy?

16:05.830 --> 16:08.427
'Cause only two people win
in the apocalypse: Mad Max

16:08.427 --> 16:10.750
and the guy with the goat-head
skull ventilator thing

16:10.750 --> 16:12.600
and that's about it.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.550
The rest of us ground up into dust

16:14.550 --> 16:16.770
and our bodies used to
pave the road to Valhalla.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.730
So instead of talking about
burning our country down,

16:18.730 --> 16:19.960
how 'bout we all just come together

16:19.960 --> 16:21.700
and fix this bitch called America?

16:21.700 --> 16:22.606
How 'bout that?

16:22.606 --> 16:24.579
(audience cheering)
Yeah.

16:24.579 --> 16:25.544
Fix this bitch.

16:25.544 --> 16:26.894
Fix this bitch.

16:26.894 --> 16:27.972
-  Fix this bitch.

16:27.972 --> 16:29.144
Fix this bitch.

16:29.144 --> 16:30.424
Fix this bitch.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.640
- Build a wall!

16:31.640 --> 16:32.744
Yes, we can!

16:32.744 --> 16:33.962
I win her!

16:33.962 --> 16:35.130
Blood and soil!

16:35.130 --> 16:37.170
Yeah.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.190
Yeah.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.640
I think we all learned this year,

16:39.640 --> 16:41.760
if you can break your
idea down to three words,

16:41.760 --> 16:44.503
dumbasses'll follow you anywhere.

16:45.594 --> 16:48.430
(laughing)

16:48.430 --> 16:49.263
Oh, come on!

16:49.263 --> 16:50.096
Nazis are back.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.360
We had khaki-pant wearing polo shirt Nazis

16:52.360 --> 16:53.193
out there this year.

16:53.193 --> 16:55.080
That was insane.

16:55.080 --> 16:55.913
That was insane.

16:55.913 --> 16:57.683
I don't think, they couldn't
all be Nazis, you know?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.690
I think some of them
were Best Buy employees

16:59.690 --> 17:01.403
walking through the park on the way home,

17:02.440 --> 17:04.270
and they just got sucked into the chant.

17:04.270 --> 17:05.877
They're like, blood and soil!

17:05.877 --> 17:07.370
Are we gardeners, what are we doing?

17:07.370 --> 17:08.830
Gimme a torch, blood and soil.

17:08.830 --> 17:09.913
What are we doin'?

17:12.670 --> 17:13.940
Was a weird year, wasn't it?

17:13.940 --> 17:15.580
We had so much weird stuff happening,

17:15.580 --> 17:17.300
hurricanes lining up off the coast

17:17.300 --> 17:20.400
like they're waiting for
rides at Disneyland, man.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.770
They ran out of names at one point.

17:21.770 --> 17:22.654
They're like, what do we name this one?

17:22.654 --> 17:24.487
Zitigua, I don't know!

17:25.717 --> 17:26.550
It was insane.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.180
And the country, we were
getting along so well.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.450
God we haven't gotten along this good

17:29.450 --> 17:31.821
since the Manson family
picnic with the Tates.

17:31.821 --> 17:34.057
(audience groaning)

17:34.057 --> 17:35.953
(sporadic applause)

17:35.953 --> 17:36.786
Well, really?

17:36.786 --> 17:38.342
You mad?

17:38.342 --> 17:39.175
Oh, shut up.

17:39.175 --> 17:41.577
I waited 50 years to tell that joke.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.830
You guys can't be mad at
a 50-year-old reference.

17:44.830 --> 17:45.663
My God.

17:47.950 --> 17:50.690
World Health Organization
proved that meat causes cancer.

17:50.690 --> 17:52.580
Great, then the Super Bowl barbecue

17:52.580 --> 17:54.623
is just a smoky-flavored war crime.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.510
Course none of us have
to worry about cancer

17:57.510 --> 17:59.390
'cause climate change
gonna drown half of us

17:59.390 --> 18:01.760
and set the other half on fire.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.993
Oh, I'm so glad it doesn't exist.

18:06.810 --> 18:07.800
It's a bad year.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.633
Prince is dead.

18:08.633 --> 18:10.503
Prince can't die, he's imaginary.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.900
And here's the sad thing for me.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.810
I thought we were doing so well.

18:17.810 --> 18:18.680
Human beings were doing,

18:18.680 --> 18:20.120
we're amazing, the stuff we do.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.440
I have a phone in my pocket right now,

18:21.440 --> 18:22.273
I hit one button,

18:22.273 --> 18:23.820
calls anywhere in the planet in a second.

18:23.820 --> 18:26.130
While I'm doing that, I can watch a video

18:26.130 --> 18:28.280
of a young child hitting
his father in the testicles

18:28.280 --> 18:29.430
with a Wiffle ball bat.

18:31.070 --> 18:33.253
That is next level human being.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.010
We eradicated polio, got rid of smallpox,

18:37.010 --> 18:38.710
made it possible to live with AIDS,

18:38.710 --> 18:40.120
but we cannot crack the code

18:40.120 --> 18:42.063
on the vaccine for stupid, can we?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.410
How do you know if you're stupid?

18:45.410 --> 18:47.650
Well, if your 10th grade English teacher

18:47.650 --> 18:50.152
helped you write your
third birth announcement,

18:50.152 --> 18:53.400
(pained groaning)

18:53.400 --> 18:54.356
you're an idiot.

18:54.356 --> 18:56.425
(audience applauding)

18:56.425 --> 18:59.613
If you spell pregnant, preeg-nart,

19:01.727 --> 19:03.394
that's another hint.

19:13.210 --> 19:14.850
I'll tell you what this
last election proved to me.

19:14.850 --> 19:15.720
It proved to me what I'm not.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.553
I'm not a Democrat.

19:16.553 --> 19:17.530
I'm not a Republican.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.120
I'm not a conservative, not a liberal.

19:19.120 --> 19:19.953
I'm not a hobbit.

19:19.953 --> 19:20.786
I'm not a orc.

19:22.405 --> 19:23.238
I'm not Slytherin.

19:23.238 --> 19:24.071
I'm not Gryffindor.

19:24.071 --> 19:26.090
And I'm definitely not a Hufflepuff.

19:27.874 --> 19:29.960
Yeah. Yeah.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.123
Yeah, screw that
imaginary group of people.

19:33.470 --> 19:34.830
I'm an independent, 100%.

19:34.830 --> 19:36.266
I believe in the death penalty.

19:36.266 --> 19:39.640
(crowd cheering)
Yes.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.320
I believe in the death penalty,

19:41.320 --> 19:42.950
but I also believe that
when you get convicted

19:42.950 --> 19:44.040
of the death penalty,

19:44.040 --> 19:45.360
they should put you in a penalty box

19:45.360 --> 19:47.253
and you get beaten to
death by hockey players.

19:47.253 --> 19:52.253
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

19:53.320 --> 19:55.190
But if it's lethal injection,

19:55.190 --> 19:57.040
it should be organic and gluten-free.

19:59.290 --> 20:01.640
Somebody might have an
allergy, you don't know.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.580
I'm getting kinda itchy in here.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.863
My last meal was supposed
to have a Claritin.

20:16.482 --> 20:17.420
I believe in abortion

20:17.420 --> 20:19.270
but only if the mother is exercising

20:19.270 --> 20:22.093
her Second Amendment
rights while performing it.

20:22.093 --> 20:24.009
(nervous laughing)

20:24.009 --> 20:25.493
(scattered applause)

20:25.493 --> 20:26.663
Well.

20:26.663 --> 20:28.023
Well.

20:28.023 --> 20:30.110
I guess somebody loves the Constitution

20:30.110 --> 20:32.263
a lot more than other people in Arizona.

20:34.631 --> 20:35.464
When I wrote that joke,

20:35.464 --> 20:38.017
I knew it was gonna get that reaction.

20:38.017 --> 20:39.608
And my brain went, say it anyway,

20:39.608 --> 20:40.458
and I said, okay.

20:43.030 --> 20:44.373
Let me tell you the problem
with America right now.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.470
It's the same problem throughout history.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.450
The problem with America
right now is they,

20:48.450 --> 20:49.510
they who run things.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.620
You, know all they want is money,

20:50.620 --> 20:51.453
all they want is power.

20:51.453 --> 20:53.450
They all have small penises, even Hillary.

20:55.540 --> 20:56.790
She's swinging something.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.730
They're the ones who start the wars.

20:59.730 --> 21:01.160
They're the one who crashed the economy.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.910
Did you crash the economy, sir?

21:02.910 --> 21:03.743
- Nope.
- No, what do you

21:03.743 --> 21:05.240
do for a living?

21:05.240 --> 21:07.610
- Maintenance.
- Maintenance. (laughing)

21:07.610 --> 21:08.443
That's kinda vague.

21:08.443 --> 21:11.023
Sounds kinda drug dealer-y, right there.

21:11.023 --> 21:12.320
What do you do, maintenance.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.390
Do you need some more?

21:13.390 --> 21:14.890
Good, I got some, here you go.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.290
You maintaining, all right.

21:18.830 --> 21:20.780
Maintenance, of course you
didn't crash the economy.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.430
Did the start the Iraq War, dude?

21:22.430 --> 21:23.310
No, of course you didn't.

21:23.310 --> 21:24.320
You worked at Ruby Tuesdays

21:24.320 --> 21:25.960
and pray to God the
hostess wasn't pregnant.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.550
I swear to God that's what you did.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.410
No, course we didn't.

21:31.410 --> 21:32.690
We never have anything to do with that.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.130
It's always they, and who are they?

21:34.130 --> 21:35.240
Well, in America's history,

21:35.240 --> 21:38.480
they are always old, ancient,
silver-haired white men.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.043
A lot of 'em are Draculas.

21:42.066 --> 21:43.577
And they all have that thing
(tenor vocal burbling).

21:47.946 --> 21:49.727
I called the Sith Lord flap.

21:53.866 --> 21:56.930
Paul Ryan's got a little one.
(falsetto vocal burbling)

21:56.930 --> 21:57.980
Obama had one.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.473
He just calmed it back, cool.

22:01.330 --> 22:03.260
He made it look good.

22:03.260 --> 22:04.660
Mitch McConnell, (heavy
bass vocal burbling).

22:06.495 --> 22:07.990
All right, I don't want
to make too much fun

22:07.990 --> 22:09.390
of Mitch McConnell 'cause I loved his work

22:09.390 --> 22:11.013
as the pelican in Finding Nemo.

22:13.847 --> 22:14.680
Awesome.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.690
That's who they are,

22:18.690 --> 22:19.740
and what they did this year,

22:19.740 --> 22:21.180
I've never seen it this bad.

22:21.180 --> 22:23.010
They convinced everybody in America

22:23.010 --> 22:24.110
it was us versus them,

22:24.110 --> 22:25.560
Democrats verus Republicans,

22:25.560 --> 22:27.020
Republicans versus Democrats.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.450
We couldn't get along.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.530
In fact, everybody in this room right now

22:30.530 --> 22:32.730
has an opinion about
someone who doesn't agree

22:32.730 --> 22:33.563
with them politically.

22:33.563 --> 22:34.396
Am I right?

22:34.396 --> 22:35.229
Hell, yeah.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.650
Every conservative in this room

22:36.650 --> 22:39.420
is a four-wheel truck driving,
sister-screwing redneck

22:39.420 --> 22:41.710
and every liberal eats kale salad

22:41.710 --> 22:42.810
out the butt of his boyfriend.

22:42.810 --> 22:43.669
Am I right?

22:43.669 --> 22:44.690
(audience cheering)

22:44.690 --> 22:45.830
Yeah.

22:45.830 --> 22:48.583
Drizzled in raspberry balsamic, come on!

22:51.360 --> 22:52.680
That's what we think about each other.

22:52.680 --> 22:53.513
It's crazy.

22:53.513 --> 22:55.490
Same ol', same country, same people, too.

22:55.490 --> 22:57.740
If I asked you, if I asked you liberals

22:57.740 --> 22:59.730
to get up here and do an
impression of a conservative,

22:59.730 --> 23:01.660
you guys would lose your minds.

23:01.660 --> 23:02.856
Oh, my God, lemme do it, lemme do it,

23:02.856 --> 23:05.090
lemme do it, lemme do it, lemme do it.

23:05.090 --> 23:05.977
I'm doin' it.

23:05.977 --> 23:07.720
I'm gonna do it, I'm just sayin'.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.020
Don't make me laugh,
Marcia, I got this, okay.

23:14.380 --> 23:15.213
Stop it.

23:16.750 --> 23:19.183
All right, my impression
of a conservative.

23:22.759 --> 23:25.798
(audience laughing)

23:25.798 --> 23:27.278
Well, I went to the Walmarts

23:27.278 --> 23:28.930
and I got me a seventh gun,

23:28.930 --> 23:31.630
then headed down to Plan
Obama at the abortion clinic.

23:31.630 --> 23:33.130
Then I went way downtown and kicked

23:33.130 --> 23:36.333
a young black feller in
the testiculars, yep.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.560
Now I'm going out to a KKK rally

23:38.560 --> 23:39.730
at a Ted Nugent concert

23:39.730 --> 23:41.640
where I'm gonna shoot me
an endangered species.

23:41.640 --> 23:42.473
Yee-haw!

23:44.614 --> 23:47.223
(audience cheering)

23:47.223 --> 23:48.723
You would think...

23:50.794 --> 23:52.521
If I asked you
conservatives to get up here

23:52.521 --> 23:53.540
and do an impression of a liberal,

23:53.540 --> 23:55.040
you guys would beat each other's ass

23:55.040 --> 23:55.873
to get on the stage.

23:55.873 --> 23:57.200
(imitating punching thuds)

23:57.200 --> 23:58.803
Shut up, Bobby, I'm doin' it.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.397
'Cause I'm better at it than you.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.633
Go ahead get up.

24:08.070 --> 24:08.960
All right, here's my
impression of a liberal.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.612
(glass dings)

24:10.612 --> 24:11.890
(harsh nasal snorting)

24:11.890 --> 24:12.723
Was that round one?

24:12.723 --> 24:13.923
What the hell just happened?

24:19.783 --> 24:21.790
All right, my impression of liberal.

24:21.790 --> 24:25.530
Here we go. (harsh throat hacking)

24:25.530 --> 24:27.430
I'll tell you when it's okay to laugh.

24:29.180 --> 24:31.050
All right, liberal (heavy grunting).

24:31.050 --> 24:31.883
Here we go.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.093
Oh my God, you won't
believe what happened.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.580
I was at my job helping
the lesbian manatees

24:41.580 --> 24:44.890
and somebody used the word Oriental

24:44.890 --> 24:46.323
and I lost my shit.

24:48.332 --> 24:49.500
I went down to the ACLU

24:49.500 --> 24:50.727
and I filed a hate crime, goddammit.

24:50.727 --> 24:54.298
And I was so upset on the way
home, I adopted a petting zoo.

24:54.298 --> 24:56.080
(snorting laugh)

24:56.080 --> 24:58.153
I actually have a lama that's a rescue.

24:59.687 --> 25:00.820
Now I'm on my way downtown,

25:00.820 --> 25:03.670
'cause inside, I'm really a
woman and I am transitioning,

25:04.954 --> 25:07.100
and I will use any damn bathroom I want,

25:07.100 --> 25:08.760
and I will molest children like I work

25:08.760 --> 25:10.333
for the U.S. Olympic Committee.

25:10.333 --> 25:13.890
(audience groaning)

25:13.890 --> 25:14.723
Really?

25:14.723 --> 25:16.830
(audience cheering)

25:16.830 --> 25:19.233
Be mad all you want, at least I'm current.

25:22.182 --> 25:24.440
I don't know anybody like that.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.840
I take that back, I know
three people like that.

25:28.342 --> 25:29.700
Two live in Prescott, Arizona,

25:29.700 --> 25:30.800
one lives in Berkeley.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.837
And I'm related to one of 'em.

25:34.730 --> 25:36.330
I don't know anybody like that.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.260
You know, it's not us
and them, the people,

25:38.260 --> 25:39.570
it's we the people,

25:39.570 --> 25:40.403
and we forgot that.

25:40.403 --> 25:43.060
And be clear, we do not have to agree

25:43.060 --> 25:45.843
but we have to get along
or this shit burns down.

25:45.843 --> 25:49.494
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

25:49.494 --> 25:51.911
But, if we could get together

25:53.980 --> 25:55.440
and show up in Washington together,

25:55.440 --> 25:57.060
red baseball hats, pink pussy hats,

25:57.060 --> 25:58.077
how ya doin'?

25:59.990 --> 26:01.230
Yeah we worked our stuff out,

26:01.230 --> 26:02.210
and I gotta be honest.

26:02.210 --> 26:05.093
I love lavender organic
potpourri, I ain't lyin'.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.020
And I don't think meat is murder anymore

26:09.020 --> 26:10.595
unless you eat people.

26:10.595 --> 26:12.332
(audience laughing)

26:12.332 --> 26:15.582
(audience applauding)

26:16.883 --> 26:17.716
We?

26:19.250 --> 26:23.073
We show up, they are fucked.

26:24.860 --> 26:25.902
They wouldn't know--
(audience whooping)

26:25.902 --> 26:28.480
Yeah.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.080
They wouldn't know what to do.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.220
They'd have to have a meeting.

26:31.220 --> 26:33.830
The meeting would go like
this (rapid tenor burbling).

26:38.912 --> 26:42.270
(falsetto burbling)

26:42.270 --> 26:43.880
And then after that meeting,

26:43.880 --> 26:47.823
they would do what they always
do when we go after they.

26:48.750 --> 26:51.703
They would invent a new them.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.763
Over there.

26:55.830 --> 26:56.950
Always a brown them.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.590
Have you noticed?

26:58.590 --> 26:59.920
Oh yeah, Iraq, brown them,

26:59.920 --> 27:00.900
Vietnam, brown them.

27:00.900 --> 27:03.700
We're all worried about
the brown them of Mexico

27:03.700 --> 27:06.010
coming across the border right now.

27:06.010 --> 27:07.520
Yeah, it's all brown them.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.630
Man, we're all scared to death

27:08.630 --> 27:10.330
of a North Korean Asian weird haircutted,

27:10.330 --> 27:12.193
weird little fat guy them.

27:14.380 --> 27:16.190
Anybody here really afraid of North Korea?

27:16.190 --> 27:17.310
'Cause I got to be honest.

27:17.310 --> 27:18.750
I can throw a Frisbee farther

27:18.750 --> 27:20.591
than North Korea can launch a missile.

27:20.591 --> 27:23.652
(audience applauding)

27:23.652 --> 27:24.485
(audience whistling)

27:24.485 --> 27:26.853
With a ton more accuracy.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.730
That's why Japan was mad.

27:29.730 --> 27:30.563
They didn't care about a nuke,

27:30.563 --> 27:31.472
they don't know he doesn't have it.

27:31.472 --> 27:35.472
They were like, he don't
know where it gonna go.

27:36.687 --> 27:38.520
Got to worry about the
brown them in Syria.

27:38.520 --> 27:39.740
Syria's got chemical weapons.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.850
Syria has always had chemical weapons.

27:41.850 --> 27:43.180
And they been at war
with a bunch of people

27:43.180 --> 27:44.540
they can't beat with Russians helping.

27:44.540 --> 27:46.170
The guys they're fighting
are attacking them

27:46.170 --> 27:47.843
driving Toyota pickup trucks.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.520
Gimme two boys from
Tennessee and one tank.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.160
We will jack up some Toyota pickup trucks.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.440
(audience applauding)

27:56.440 --> 27:58.760
Yeah, but that's the way they do it.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.090
That's the way they keep we separate,

28:01.090 --> 28:02.600
talking about the them, you know?

28:02.600 --> 28:03.910
And also, that the brown them

28:03.910 --> 28:05.070
always hates our white Jesus.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.010
Remember that, oh, they hate Christianity.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.400
Oh, the brown them hates Christianity,

28:08.400 --> 28:09.460
they hate the white Jesus.

28:09.460 --> 28:10.300
And I have to say this,

28:10.300 --> 28:13.230
white Jesus in the Middle
East, in the desert?

28:13.230 --> 28:14.063
Really?

28:18.600 --> 28:21.350
Is Santa Claus also a telepathic unicorn

28:21.350 --> 28:25.530
because had Jesus shown up at that time,

28:25.530 --> 28:29.723
this color, they woulda
killed him a lot faster.

28:31.159 --> 28:33.370
(audience whooping)

28:33.370 --> 28:35.493
The Bible would have been a pamphlet.

28:37.769 --> 28:39.950
Woulda looked like a Bed
Bath & Beyond coupon.

28:39.950 --> 28:42.020
I don't know.

28:42.020 --> 28:42.853
They're handing out Bibles.

28:42.853 --> 28:44.440
Says I get 20% off my immortal soul.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.633
That's pretty good.

28:47.019 --> 28:47.852
I'm gonna put that in a drawer.

28:47.852 --> 28:48.973
It's good till April a.d.

28:52.730 --> 28:53.563
So, don't buy it,

28:53.563 --> 28:54.850
'cause this whole thing
that's going on right now

28:54.850 --> 28:56.890
with our government is gonna get weirder.

28:56.890 --> 28:58.210
Stay we.

28:58.210 --> 29:01.220
Don't let they distract you with the them.

29:01.220 --> 29:05.529
And one more thing: do not
tell they we talked about this.

29:05.529 --> 29:10.529
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

29:12.350 --> 29:14.763
I may disappear.

29:15.990 --> 29:18.410
Or they will turn me into a them,

29:18.410 --> 29:20.030
and then I'll be in
Russia with Edward Snowden

29:20.030 --> 29:21.403
going, you got any threes?

29:28.917 --> 29:29.834
Weird time.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.250
Weird time, weird time.

29:33.250 --> 29:34.820
Poorly-educated got
pissed during election.

29:34.820 --> 29:35.899
They kept saying that on the news,

29:35.899 --> 29:38.300
the poorly-educated are
voting big for Trump.

29:38.300 --> 29:39.470
The poorly-educated love Trump,

29:39.470 --> 29:40.303
they're voting through the roof for Trump.

29:40.303 --> 29:43.130
They poorly-educated
think Trump is amazing.

29:43.130 --> 29:44.780
Say what you want about
Trump, like him or hate him,

29:44.780 --> 29:47.940
you have to admit this man has no filter

29:47.940 --> 29:50.442
and the biggest balls of
anybody we put in that office.

29:50.442 --> 29:51.590
(audience applauding)

29:51.590 --> 29:52.870
Yeah, yeah.

29:52.870 --> 29:53.840
So did Hitler.

29:53.840 --> 29:54.673
Don't clap.

29:56.453 --> 29:57.830
I got a lot of friends that got big balls

29:57.830 --> 30:01.100
and I don't invite 'em over to
parties at my house anymore,

30:01.100 --> 30:02.613
because the cops follow.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.900
Trump had the balls to
get on stage in front

30:06.900 --> 30:08.780
of thousands of people
after that poll came out

30:08.780 --> 30:11.437
and he said, "I love the poorly-educated.

30:11.437 --> 30:14.210
"I love the poorly-educated."

30:14.210 --> 30:16.783
And the poorly-educated
were like, he loves us.

30:23.197 --> 30:25.403
And he made fun of us
in the same sentence.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.380
I think he did, I ain't sure.

30:28.380 --> 30:29.603
I'm poorly-educated.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.050
I got to be honest with you,

30:32.050 --> 30:34.190
I don't love the poorly-educated.

30:34.190 --> 30:35.097
They're dumb as shit.

30:35.097 --> 30:37.047
(audience laughing)

30:37.047 --> 30:38.930
(audience clapping)
(audience whooping)

30:38.930 --> 30:41.950
And they have never helped, not one time.

30:41.950 --> 30:45.130
Nothing cool was ever
invented by a dumbass.

30:45.130 --> 30:46.900
Never happen.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.530
They've never cured a disease.

30:48.530 --> 30:49.690
They didn't fix your car better.

30:49.690 --> 30:51.030
They didn't fix your phone.

30:51.030 --> 30:52.330
You know, when the poorly-educated

30:52.330 --> 30:54.030
do built something, it always falls over

30:54.030 --> 30:56.243
and crushes the meth lab, every time!

30:58.890 --> 31:01.230
The poorly-educated can suck my left nut,

31:01.230 --> 31:02.850
thank you very much.

31:02.850 --> 31:05.500
And, why can I talk smack
about the poorly-educated?

31:05.500 --> 31:08.119
Because I, ha ha, am one of them.

31:08.119 --> 31:09.224
(audience whooping)
(audience applauding)

31:09.224 --> 31:10.057
Yes!

31:12.840 --> 31:15.033
I am the poorly-educated Lizard King.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.220
I'm not making that up,
I'm not making that,

31:18.220 --> 31:19.640
I did not graduate high school.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.713
I was let go.

31:23.366 --> 31:25.990
I was laid off from my senior year.

31:25.990 --> 31:28.540
I showed up and they went,
we filled your position.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.210
Said, but I'm not done.

31:31.210 --> 31:32.223
Oh, yes, you are.

31:33.450 --> 31:34.440
And I'm not making that up.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.760
California public schools,
at that time, were so bad.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.610
It didn't matter what grade you got,

31:38.610 --> 31:40.520
they just kept herding
you through the system.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.600
They're like, moo-ve.

31:42.907 --> 31:43.740
Moo-ve!

31:44.870 --> 31:46.920
Couldn't spell move, but I was movin' on.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.173
I'm not making this up.

31:50.173 --> 31:51.770
And I'm not stupid, obviously,

31:51.770 --> 31:54.358
but I'm uneducated, you know?

31:54.358 --> 31:57.403
I was just smart enough to
know I was a raging idiot.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.090
I'm not making this up.

32:00.090 --> 32:02.600
My last report card of my 8th grade year,

32:02.600 --> 32:05.443
I got four Fs and a D,

32:06.316 --> 32:07.816
and I was like, D!

32:13.202 --> 32:14.035
And I went to my teachers,

32:14.035 --> 32:14.960
ah, I guess I'll be back next year.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.353
They went, no, no, no,
you're a ninth grader now.

32:19.936 --> 32:21.270
-  Yeah!

32:21.270 --> 32:23.423
- Nine is the number after eight.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.310
So, I had to get smart after school

32:28.310 --> 32:30.370
because I wanted to be a comedian.

32:30.370 --> 32:33.040
And just to be clear, this is the only job

32:33.040 --> 32:34.743
I am qualified to do.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.193
And I've already pissed some
of you off doing it tonight.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.610
But as a comedian, you have to know

32:42.610 --> 32:43.660
what you're talkin about.

32:43.660 --> 32:44.890
You can't just make stuff up.

32:44.890 --> 32:46.080
You can't be like, Abe Lincoln

32:46.080 --> 32:48.232
was the best Cambodian
president we ever had.

32:48.232 --> 32:49.210
You know?

32:49.210 --> 32:51.080
'Member the kimchi wars of 1312

32:51.080 --> 32:52.880
we signed the Declaration of Codependence?

32:52.880 --> 32:53.853
That was insane.

32:55.402 --> 32:57.392
You just look like a dumbass.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.190
So to be good at comedy,
so I was accurate,

32:59.190 --> 33:00.450
I started studying after school.

33:00.450 --> 33:03.180
I did, I went back and I studied history,

33:03.180 --> 33:05.435
and science, and math.

33:05.435 --> 33:07.635
I haven't written a
whole lot of math jokes.

33:10.235 --> 33:12.443
And when I did, the exponent was wrong.

33:14.850 --> 33:16.965
And that's the only math
joke I have ever written.

33:16.965 --> 33:19.662
(audience cheering)

33:19.662 --> 33:21.329
Thank you very much.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.203
And I don't understand it.

33:31.730 --> 33:33.930
So now, when I want to write
comedy about something,

33:33.930 --> 33:35.250
I have to study it really hard,

33:35.250 --> 33:37.620
and I've been studying the
alt-right for the while now,

33:37.620 --> 33:38.453
the alternate right.

33:38.453 --> 33:39.830
They said, Trump got
helped by the alt-right.

33:39.830 --> 33:41.220
The alternative right helped Trump.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.560
If you don't know what the alt-right is,

33:42.560 --> 33:43.900
best definition I can give you

33:43.900 --> 33:45.130
is it rhymes with all white.

33:45.130 --> 33:46.563
Let's leave it there.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.200
And thank God.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.300
Thank God somebody is finally standing up

33:51.300 --> 33:53.323
for the oppressed white man in America.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.720
We have had that boot heel of oppression

33:55.720 --> 33:58.000
on our necks for how long, gentlemen?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.650
My God, we haven't committed genocide

33:59.650 --> 34:01.440
on a brown people in a coon's age!

34:01.440 --> 34:02.307
Am I right?

34:02.307 --> 34:03.640
(audience laughing)

34:03.640 --> 34:06.890
(audience whooping)

34:06.890 --> 34:09.273
Let's a white guilt flow, whitey, come on.

34:11.180 --> 34:13.350
Yeah, amazing to me.

34:13.350 --> 34:15.190
240 years of white presidents.

34:15.190 --> 34:17.983
We had a one black guy
and whitey had a stroke.

34:19.150 --> 34:20.547
43 white guys, one black guy,

34:20.547 --> 34:22.320
and white people are
like, no more black guys,

34:22.320 --> 34:23.600
no more black guys, no, no, no.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.500
Why? Why?

34:24.500 --> 34:27.050
I'll tell you why, the NBA and golf.

34:27.050 --> 34:28.740
Right there, that's why, right there.

34:28.740 --> 34:30.440
And those sisters took over tennis,

34:30.440 --> 34:32.270
and North Korea's got ping pong.

34:32.270 --> 34:33.103
All we got left is white guys,

34:33.103 --> 34:34.300
and you throw that thing on the ice,

34:34.300 --> 34:35.246
and you sweep in front of it.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.079
That's all we got.

34:36.079 --> 34:37.128
That's all we got!

34:37.128 --> 34:38.545
Look like idiots.

34:39.527 --> 34:40.930
And a woman president?

34:40.930 --> 34:43.523
Are you out of your (blows raspberries).

34:43.523 --> 34:46.660
No, no, no, I don't care if
she most qualified we ever had.

34:46.660 --> 34:50.063
Emails, Benghazi, Bill
Clinton's deplorable penis, ah!

34:51.938 --> 34:54.938
(audience laughing)

34:57.490 --> 34:59.470
Yeah, we didn't want a
vagina in the White House

34:59.470 --> 35:02.346
so we voted for the
other side of the taint.

35:02.346 --> 35:03.952
(audience groaning)

35:03.952 --> 35:06.690
(audience chortling)
(audience applauding)

35:06.690 --> 35:07.523
Good joke.

35:08.513 --> 35:10.170
Good joke.

35:10.170 --> 35:11.003
Good joke.

35:12.219 --> 35:15.620
I know, even the Trump people
gotta be like, all right.

35:15.620 --> 35:18.310
That's a good joke,
that's a really good joke.

35:18.310 --> 35:21.473
Lemme tell you how good
that joke actually is.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.190
So, I got rid of my old
show, Born with a Defect.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.910
I wrote it and filmed
it, just got rid of it.

35:25.910 --> 35:26.743
And I always write new stuff

35:26.743 --> 35:27.900
'cause I always want you guys to come back

35:27.900 --> 35:28.733
and see new material.

35:28.733 --> 35:29.610
You know, it's not fair to you guys,

35:29.610 --> 35:30.443
keep me repeating stuff.

35:30.443 --> 35:31.710
So, I wrote the new show,

35:31.710 --> 35:33.200
and I've been doing this so long

35:33.200 --> 35:35.660
I don't check where I go anymore.

35:35.660 --> 35:36.850
So, that Monday, I called my agent.

35:36.850 --> 35:37.710
I go, where am I going this weekend?

35:37.710 --> 35:38.703
He goes, Alabama.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.838
(audience laughing)

35:43.800 --> 35:44.633
No.

35:46.861 --> 35:48.580
I am not going to Alabama

35:49.770 --> 35:51.753
because Kevlar is expensive.

35:54.941 --> 35:55.774
But if you know me at all,

35:55.774 --> 35:57.850
you know damn well I'm going to Alabama.

35:57.850 --> 35:59.370
I figure if I get shot,

35:59.370 --> 36:00.327
I'll be super famous,

36:00.327 --> 36:02.463
and I could really use a bump right now.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.780
Yeah, I've been I've been thinking

36:06.780 --> 36:09.430
about sexually assaulted
somebody just for the press.

36:11.090 --> 36:12.790
Sign up sheet at the door, ladies.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.687
Or dudes, let's get weird,
whatever you wanna do.

36:21.078 --> 36:22.300
So, I go to Alabama.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.730
First night, I'm in Birmingham, Alabama,

36:23.730 --> 36:26.070
and the show was so raw at the time.

36:26.070 --> 36:29.540
I have 40 new pages, I'm
reading them off a stool.

36:29.540 --> 36:31.000
And I think that's what saved me,

36:31.000 --> 36:34.080
'cause in Alabama, they couldn't
believe I could do that.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.380
(audience laughing)

36:37.380 --> 36:39.390
They were like, he looks at the paper

36:39.390 --> 36:40.950
and then says what it says.

36:40.950 --> 36:42.523
He's like a warlock.

36:46.741 --> 36:50.010
And I wish I was only being
half truthful about that joke.

36:50.010 --> 36:52.180
The second night, though, I
went to Huntsville, Alabama.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.330
Huntsville, Alabama is different

36:53.330 --> 36:55.290
because you don't wanna
just make fun of Alabama,

36:55.290 --> 36:56.620
'cause it's got all the aerospace there,

36:56.620 --> 36:58.550
Lockheed is there, you know,

36:58.550 --> 37:00.660
and all this crazy
aerospace, NASA's there.

37:00.660 --> 37:02.280
So in Huntsville, Alabama

37:02.280 --> 37:06.410
it's rednecks and rocket scientists,

37:06.410 --> 37:08.943
and they been a-minglin' since the '60s.

37:10.130 --> 37:13.140
So you meet some weird ass
people in Huntsville, Alabama.

37:13.140 --> 37:15.790
Yeah, we figured out the
orbit of Alpha Centauri

37:15.790 --> 37:17.057
for the next 1,500 years

37:17.057 --> 37:20.123
and my mama makes a damn
good lizard cornbread.

37:25.925 --> 37:26.758
So, I go to Huntsville.

37:26.758 --> 37:28.140
It's a brand new club.

37:28.140 --> 37:29.490
I'm the opening, grand opening

37:29.490 --> 37:31.520
because they know Titus is
gonna tell goofy stories

37:31.520 --> 37:34.720
about his dad. (chuckling)

37:34.720 --> 37:36.123
And I'm doing this show.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.310
And it was going well.

37:38.310 --> 37:39.144
There's some smart people in the audience.

37:39.144 --> 37:40.380
Everybody's cool, you know?

37:40.380 --> 37:41.213
They were laughing, a lot of 'em.

37:41.213 --> 37:43.293
There was like nine people
that really enjoyed it.

37:45.135 --> 37:46.660
And there was a table right over here

37:46.660 --> 37:48.800
of eight people and these people looked

37:49.670 --> 37:51.693
like they had swamp-boated in.

37:53.607 --> 37:54.650
I am not kidding.

37:54.650 --> 37:57.873
Everything you think Alabama
is was sitting at that table.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.720
One guy had a beard this long,

38:00.720 --> 38:03.190
looked like Uncle Jesse
from Dukes of Hazzard.

38:03.190 --> 38:06.670
I keep calling him Duck
Dynasty the whole show.

38:06.670 --> 38:08.220
Audience laughs, he doesn't laugh

38:08.220 --> 38:09.970
'cause he thinks it's a compliment.

38:13.810 --> 38:15.930
But the man next to
him is this giant Bubba

38:15.930 --> 38:17.330
wearing a red white and blue jersey

38:17.330 --> 38:20.647
that says 45 and Trump
across the shoulder.

38:20.647 --> 38:21.560
(audience groans in dismay)

38:21.560 --> 38:22.760
And I'm doing this show.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.803
Both guys are watching the show like this.

38:29.730 --> 38:31.157
I get to that joke.

38:31.157 --> 38:32.930
Ah, didn't want a vagina
in the White House

38:32.930 --> 38:34.780
so we voted for the
other side of the taint.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.640
And the guy with the beard goes...

38:40.170 --> 38:41.531
All right, goddammit, that's pretty funny.

38:41.531 --> 38:43.013
All right, (mumbles).

38:43.013 --> 38:46.494
And I was like, comedy
can heal the nation, yes!

38:46.494 --> 38:48.472
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

38:48.472 --> 38:49.305
Yes!

38:51.480 --> 38:53.533
Punchlines will bring us together.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.573
We will bridge the chasm with sarcasm.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.820
So, let's talk about the
alt-right for a second.

39:01.820 --> 39:03.650
The alt-right is a group of white guys

39:03.650 --> 39:05.010
that believe America should be

39:05.010 --> 39:07.590
a all-white country
like it always has been

39:07.590 --> 39:09.993
because they don't read a lot.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.380
They don't like immigration, brown people,

39:14.380 --> 39:15.270
black people, and Jews.

39:15.270 --> 39:18.580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, and they
hate political correctness.

39:18.580 --> 39:20.243
They wanna keep it ra-zeal.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.193
Really?

39:24.350 --> 39:25.670
You hate political correctness,

39:25.670 --> 39:27.440
and why would you call
yourself the alternative right?

39:27.440 --> 39:30.090
You sound like a shitty
Miley Cyrus metal cover band.

39:32.390 --> 39:34.693
We're the alt-right and
we're gonna rock you.

39:36.696 --> 39:38.700
Because if you don't like immigration,

39:38.700 --> 39:40.300
brown people, black people, and Jews,

39:40.300 --> 39:43.313
the non-political-correct term is Nazi.

39:45.820 --> 39:46.991
You're a Nazi.

39:46.991 --> 39:48.441
And, and, hey.

39:48.441 --> 39:49.740
I'm not calling you a Nazi.

39:49.740 --> 39:52.390
Let's just go to the chart
'cause it matches exactly.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.910
In fact, if you didn't know
that's what a Nazi was,

39:55.910 --> 39:57.650
you guys are like Nazi-stradamus.

39:57.650 --> 39:58.963
That's amazing to me.

40:00.610 --> 40:02.880
And why would you spend
all that money and time

40:02.880 --> 40:04.960
marketing a new name when
you already got a logo

40:04.960 --> 40:06.253
that everybody knows?

40:09.202 --> 40:10.780
And that real cool high five?

40:10.780 --> 40:11.882
Come on, man.

40:11.882 --> 40:15.049
(audience applauding)

40:16.310 --> 40:17.143
I love it.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.610
The alternative right,

40:19.610 --> 40:22.023
we don't call serial
killers cadaver creators.

40:24.490 --> 40:27.303
You guys don't buy your drugs
from a street CEO, do you?

40:28.660 --> 40:30.860
Yes, I scored my meth
today from the president

40:30.860 --> 40:33.510
of the company and his office
is behind the Dumpster.

40:34.831 --> 40:36.281
I believe they're remodeling.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.720
If you're a Nazi, just say you're a Nazi,

40:40.720 --> 40:42.003
you fuckin' Nazi.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.010
I can't believe they're coming back, man.

40:46.010 --> 40:47.110
That Charlottesville thing,

40:47.110 --> 40:50.810
that was a ragtag ass group
of Nazis, was that not?

40:50.810 --> 40:52.603
That was not the varsity.

40:54.370 --> 40:58.193
I have never been
offended for Nazis before.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.993
Those guys needed a seminar, man.

41:02.830 --> 41:06.480
They need like a Tony Robbins
Nazi to help their ass out.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.103
I would like to welcome
everyone to the seminar!

41:14.227 --> 41:15.730
I would like to point
some of you were late.

41:15.730 --> 41:17.020
Nazis aren't late!

41:21.378 --> 41:24.380
Now, I have a couple of
announcements before we get started.

41:24.380 --> 41:27.919
At the break we will be having juice.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.919
(audience laughing)

41:31.818 --> 41:34.100
(audience applauding)

41:34.100 --> 41:35.150
You don't like juice?

41:37.190 --> 41:38.833
I love fresh-squeezed juice.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.330
So Nazis, let's talk about the details.

41:47.330 --> 41:50.930
I saw the Charlottesville
video, and all I have to say

41:50.930 --> 41:51.830
is (rapid tsking).

41:56.020 --> 41:57.253
Details.

41:58.180 --> 42:01.163
Nazis do not wear Lynyrd
Skynyrd tee-shirts.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.750
We hate the Lynyrd Skynyrd.

42:05.830 --> 42:07.229
We like the Eagles.

42:07.229 --> 42:08.999
(audience laughing)

42:08.999 --> 42:11.719
(audience applauding)

42:11.719 --> 42:12.552
Yes.

42:14.740 --> 42:16.873
It's on all the logos.

42:18.890 --> 42:19.950
Some other details:

42:19.950 --> 42:21.550
I saw the flags you were flying.

42:21.550 --> 42:23.793
Yes, yes I saw the flags you were flying,

42:24.778 --> 42:26.466
the Confederate flag,

42:26.466 --> 42:29.090
(speaks in foreign
language) the Nazi flag.

42:29.090 --> 42:30.870
Which, by the way, don't tell anyone,

42:30.870 --> 42:33.470
were two of the biggest
historic losers of all time.

42:35.138 --> 42:35.971
Sh.

42:38.378 --> 42:40.830
But I noticed as you were flying the flag,

42:40.830 --> 42:41.894
they were all wrinkled

42:41.894 --> 42:43.393
(speaks in foreign language) crinkled.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.673
Details.

42:46.673 --> 42:50.143
Nazis, if you're going to hate, steam.

42:50.143 --> 42:53.143
(audience laughing)

42:55.343 --> 42:58.510
(audience applauding)

42:59.413 --> 43:03.573
That is my favorite joke of the new show.

43:03.573 --> 43:06.573
(audience cheering)

43:07.422 --> 43:08.339
And well...

43:10.542 --> 43:11.480
There's a lot of reasons
why they say Trump won.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.013
It's not because he's the best guy.

43:13.013 --> 43:13.846
There's a lot of reasons.

43:13.846 --> 43:15.180
They said, oh, he won because
Obamacare was too bad.

43:15.180 --> 43:17.210
I disagree, I think it's
'cause Obamacare was too good.

43:17.210 --> 43:18.043
I'm not making this up.

43:18.043 --> 43:19.343
The top 10 states that voted for Trump

43:19.343 --> 43:20.840
are also the top 10 states

43:20.840 --> 43:23.860
with the highest
prescription opioid abuse,

43:23.860 --> 43:26.453
so Obamacare was working its ass off.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.743
People had all their drugs
in Costco quantities.

43:32.060 --> 43:34.250
And here's what bothers me about that:

43:34.250 --> 43:36.140
you get busted for driving high

43:36.140 --> 43:38.423
but you can vote high whenever you want>

43:39.290 --> 43:40.850
That's where we need
some damn checkpoints,

43:40.850 --> 43:41.850
at the voting booth.

43:42.950 --> 43:44.140
Have just troopers lined up,

43:44.140 --> 43:44.973
the wrong guy comes in.

43:44.973 --> 43:48.180
Woo, I'm here to vote for my man, Don T.

43:48.180 --> 43:50.850
Sir, can you step out of line, please sir?

43:50.850 --> 43:52.090
Yes sir, step over here, sir.

43:52.090 --> 43:54.563
I'm gonna give you a voter
sobriety test right now.

43:55.710 --> 43:57.513
No, sir, there's no spelling, relax.

44:00.898 --> 44:02.890
(audience whooping)

44:02.890 --> 44:04.570
Sir, I'm gonna ask you a couple question

44:04.570 --> 44:05.410
and based on your answers,

44:05.410 --> 44:06.810
we're gonna determine
whether you're capable

44:06.810 --> 44:08.100
of voting in an American election.

44:08.100 --> 44:09.100
Are you ready?

44:09.100 --> 44:10.500
Sir, do you think 9/11 was a hoax?

44:10.500 --> 44:13.280
Hell, yeah and then chem
trails killed my dog.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.570
Get on the floor, right now!

44:14.570 --> 44:16.012
Get on the floor!

44:16.012 --> 44:17.412
Get on the floor!

44:17.412 --> 44:19.212
Back away from the booth, right now!

44:21.241 --> 44:22.074
Yeah.

44:23.480 --> 44:24.880
Yeah, I got one.

44:25.810 --> 44:26.643
Can I tase him?

44:28.258 --> 44:31.327
(imitates electric buzzing)
Sorry, I tased him.

44:31.327 --> 44:34.015
No, no, no, we're good,
my body camera was off.

44:34.015 --> 44:35.807
(audience laughing)

44:35.807 --> 44:38.905
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

44:38.905 --> 44:39.738
Yeah?

44:41.510 --> 44:44.020
So, here's what I think
happened in those states.

44:44.020 --> 44:45.650
Pico woke up the day after the election,

44:45.650 --> 44:48.280
like damn, baby, what
did we do last night?

44:49.363 --> 44:51.130
Why I can barely feel my right leg.

44:51.130 --> 44:51.963
That was a good night.

44:51.963 --> 44:52.796
I don't remember nothing.

44:52.796 --> 44:53.629
You remember anything?

44:53.629 --> 44:54.933
Whoo, ha ha.

44:57.650 --> 45:02.473
Baby, I got a sticker on
my forehead says I voted.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.510
Quick, let's see what happened.

45:06.510 --> 45:08.092
Turn on the learnin' box.

45:08.092 --> 45:11.175
(audience laughing)

45:17.921 --> 45:19.000
And the news was crazy.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.233
The news says things this last election,

45:20.233 --> 45:21.066
I didn't get it.

45:21.066 --> 45:22.630
They kept saying things like,

45:22.630 --> 45:25.000
the disenfranchised white
male worker's voting big,

45:25.000 --> 45:25.850
big for Trump.

45:25.850 --> 45:26.920
The disenfranchised white male

45:26.920 --> 45:28.117
from the rust belt states just loves Trump

45:28.117 --> 45:29.200
and is voting big.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.530
The disenfranchised white male.

45:30.530 --> 45:32.960
How come when I black guy
doesn't have a job, he's lazy,

45:32.960 --> 45:34.190
but when I white guy doesn't have a job,

45:34.190 --> 45:35.683
he's disenfranchised?

45:37.040 --> 45:39.040
No, I'm not unemployed.

45:39.040 --> 45:42.723
I'm disenfranchised and this
is an amazing Chardonnay.

45:46.200 --> 45:47.320
Black people, I have to be honest,

45:47.320 --> 45:48.290
it's the only time in my life,

45:48.290 --> 45:49.730
it's the one reason I'm happy I'm white.

45:49.730 --> 45:51.440
That's my word, I use it all the time.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.900
No, no, no my ex-wife did not cheat on me,

45:53.900 --> 45:56.702
she disenfranchised me
with two other gentlemen.

45:56.702 --> 45:57.835
(audience laughing)

45:57.835 --> 45:58.668
(audience applauding)

45:58.668 --> 46:03.130
Yes, and then, her lawyer disenfranchised

46:03.130 --> 46:04.883
the shit out of my bank account.

46:06.840 --> 46:07.870
It was a bad year.

46:07.870 --> 46:10.713
I was bent over a table and
repeatedly disenfranchised.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.008
(audience whooping)

46:17.008 --> 46:19.810
Such a bullshit word, man.

46:19.810 --> 46:21.873
It sounds like the Taco Bell
near you got closed down,

46:21.873 --> 46:23.060
doesn't it?

46:23.060 --> 46:25.783
No more Gorditas, guys,
we've been disenfranchised.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.210
But there's a grain of truth in it,

46:30.210 --> 46:31.740
there's a grain of truth
in that reason, man.

46:31.740 --> 46:32.670
You know why, 'cause in America

46:32.670 --> 46:33.840
we are taught from the second we're born

46:33.840 --> 46:35.890
you can be or do anything in America.

46:35.890 --> 46:37.260
The American dream, right?

46:37.260 --> 46:39.170
The land of opportunity, you can be in it.

46:39.170 --> 46:41.210
If you start with zero,
you could be a millionaire.

46:41.210 --> 46:43.090
In America, you can be anything.

46:43.090 --> 46:44.190
And after you hear that your whole life,

46:44.190 --> 46:46.480
you find yourself 40, 50 years
old, you haven't made it.

46:46.480 --> 46:47.530
You're pissed.

46:47.530 --> 46:49.793
I was there when I was 18, frankly.

46:51.130 --> 46:52.480
No, because we had this kid in our school,

46:52.480 --> 46:53.750
Rod Kana-maka-pua.

46:53.750 --> 46:56.060
Yeah, he was Hawaiian,
so he was a brown them.

46:56.060 --> 46:56.893
Ho-ho.

46:58.398 --> 46:59.980
And then I found out Hawaii was a state,

46:59.980 --> 47:00.830
so I let that go.

47:04.830 --> 47:06.220
But Rod was our valedictorian.

47:06.220 --> 47:09.150
Straight A student,
lettered in four sports.

47:09.150 --> 47:11.640
On top of that, he was a nice guy.

47:11.640 --> 47:12.945
Fuck him.

47:12.945 --> 47:17.945
(audience laughing)
(audience applauding)

47:19.140 --> 47:21.160
We all know that, yet I was
mad at him for a long time,

47:21.160 --> 47:22.710
'cause he went to MIT,
full-ride scholarship,

47:22.710 --> 47:24.060
started a company, made a bunch of money.

47:24.060 --> 47:26.040
And I remember being mad
for a long time at this guy,

47:26.040 --> 47:27.500
and then one day, I woke up to the fact

47:27.500 --> 47:29.770
I can't be mad at somebody
who went to class,

47:29.770 --> 47:31.090
got a degree and started a company

47:31.090 --> 47:34.033
while I bought four jet
skis at 21% interest.

47:37.082 --> 47:38.880
I could have gone to a
community college, you know,

47:38.880 --> 47:40.420
but instead I moved to a rural area

47:40.420 --> 47:41.253
where things were cheaper,

47:41.253 --> 47:42.280
and there's a lot of people like me.

47:42.280 --> 47:43.933
You know, pasty, furry, angry,

47:45.170 --> 47:47.923
smelling of Pabst Blue Ribbon
and misspelled tattoos.

47:49.220 --> 47:50.830
And we'd sit around
after the game on Sunday

47:50.830 --> 47:52.250
and bitch about the elites
running crap, we'd say

47:52.250 --> 47:54.900
and then we play another
round of racial slur Jeopardy!

47:54.900 --> 47:57.010
Yeah.

47:57.010 --> 47:58.250
Yeah, we talked about the minorities

47:58.250 --> 47:59.850
sucking at the government tit, we'd say,

47:59.850 --> 48:03.000
as we folded our welfare
checks into our wallets,

48:03.000 --> 48:04.680
not seeing the irony or knowing

48:04.680 --> 48:06.313
what irony means, ironically.

48:08.380 --> 48:10.010
And while we did that,
the nerds, and the geeks,

48:10.010 --> 48:11.330
and the elites did impossible things

48:11.330 --> 48:12.960
like read and not get DUIs

48:15.383 --> 48:16.870
while I let my fourth girlfriend pop out

48:16.870 --> 48:18.080
our seventh little diaper-filler,

48:18.080 --> 48:19.830
then scream get them
kids outta my meth lab!

48:19.830 --> 48:20.933
That's my man cave,

48:22.280 --> 48:23.250
plus, I just rebuilt it.

48:23.250 --> 48:24.690
It might fall over and crush another one.

48:24.690 --> 48:25.523
You don't know.

48:28.786 --> 48:30.360
And then one day, I woke up angry,

48:30.360 --> 48:34.403
bitter, unemployed, in debt, racist.

48:36.530 --> 48:37.843
But I still had Netflix.

48:41.290 --> 48:43.450
I'm gonna have to be honest
with everybody tonight.

48:43.450 --> 48:46.130
In America, if you're a white man

48:46.130 --> 48:49.422
and you can't make something
happen in this country...

48:49.422 --> 48:50.980
(chuckling)

48:50.980 --> 48:52.023
It ain't China.

48:53.630 --> 48:54.620
It ain't Mexico.

48:54.620 --> 48:55.453
It ain't NAFTA.

48:55.453 --> 48:56.720
It ain't TBP.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.950
In America, if you're a capable white man

48:58.950 --> 49:02.803
and you can't make something
happen, that's on you.

49:03.870 --> 49:05.257
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

49:05.257 --> 49:07.007
That's on you, sorry.

49:08.246 --> 49:09.079
And...

49:10.690 --> 49:13.280
Do you wanna know how I know that?

49:13.280 --> 49:15.403
I am a D/F student.

49:17.150 --> 49:20.040
On paper, I should be
being forcibly snuggled

49:20.040 --> 49:22.373
in a penitentiary right now,

49:24.490 --> 49:27.193
and you guys paid to see me.

49:27.193 --> 49:29.043
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

49:29.043 --> 49:30.293
That's America.

49:31.473 --> 49:32.723
That's America.

49:35.073 --> 49:37.100
I love this country, best place ever.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.010
I've been all over the world.

49:38.010 --> 49:38.843
This is the best.

49:38.843 --> 49:40.077
You want to know how good America is?

49:40.077 --> 49:42.210
Let me explain to you how good America is.

49:42.210 --> 49:44.350
In America, if you don't have a job,

49:44.350 --> 49:46.250
you can walk out into the middle

49:46.250 --> 49:48.680
of the Home Depot parking lot,

49:48.680 --> 49:52.704
stand there, and a job will drive up.

49:52.704 --> 49:55.323
(audience laughing)
(audience clapping)

49:55.323 --> 49:58.323
(audience whooping)

50:01.150 --> 50:02.863
Why, yes, I am disenfranchised.

50:04.646 --> 50:06.530
I would love to help
you dig a sewer trench

50:06.530 --> 50:07.483
in your backyard.

50:09.136 --> 50:10.636
Manuel, after you.

50:12.350 --> 50:14.650
Manuel, you do realize
I'm the foreman, right?

50:17.300 --> 50:19.006
That's a little joke for
the alternative right,

50:19.006 --> 50:20.353
that's for you guys, there you go.

50:20.353 --> 50:22.675
(audience cheering)

50:22.675 --> 50:25.740
I love this country.

50:25.740 --> 50:27.120
There's no other place in the world

50:27.120 --> 50:28.795
I could do what I do
and be successful at it.

50:28.795 --> 50:29.880
And you know what I
hate more than anything?

50:29.880 --> 50:31.080
When people insult America.

50:31.080 --> 50:32.570
Don't you hate it when
people insult America?

50:32.570 --> 50:33.403
I know what you hate, don't you hate it

50:33.403 --> 50:34.550
when people insult this
country, don't you?

50:34.550 --> 50:35.500
I hate it, man.

50:35.500 --> 50:36.880
Make America Great Again.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.350
Fuck you, it's great right now.

50:38.350 --> 50:39.320
What are you talking about?

50:39.320 --> 50:43.740
Have you been here?
(audience cheering)

50:43.740 --> 50:45.590
Pissed me off, man.

50:45.590 --> 50:47.880
This is the best country in the world,

50:47.880 --> 50:49.130
and I want you to know I love it

50:49.130 --> 50:51.280
more than anything, and that's why tonight

50:51.280 --> 50:53.920
will be my last comedy show,

50:53.920 --> 50:55.410
because tomorrow,

50:55.410 --> 50:57.792
I start running for president
of these United States.

50:57.792 --> 51:00.472
(audience cheering)

51:00.472 --> 51:01.668
Yeah.

51:01.668 --> 51:03.319
Yeah, I know, thank you.

51:03.319 --> 51:05.790
Now, why should I be president?

51:05.790 --> 51:07.020
Well, didn't we all look at the TV

51:07.020 --> 51:08.080
at one point in last two years

51:08.080 --> 51:10.593
and go, fuck, I can do this?

51:11.910 --> 51:14.280
I'm a lot like him, tall
white guy with a giant head.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.113
There you go.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.723
My hands are bigger, sorry.

51:19.620 --> 51:21.282
And you're welcome.

51:21.282 --> 51:24.572
(audience laughing)

51:24.572 --> 51:25.405
I'm a lot like him.

51:25.405 --> 51:28.523
I say stupid, crazy, insane
shit on stage all the time,

51:30.680 --> 51:32.390
but that's where him
and I differ, you know?

51:32.390 --> 51:33.420
We start to split off there.

51:33.420 --> 51:35.003
I don't have any bankruptcies.

51:37.220 --> 51:41.120
I pay my taxes, late, but I pay 'em,

51:41.120 --> 51:42.667
plus penalties (angry growling).

51:45.080 --> 51:47.448
I don't have any rape cases to settle.

51:47.448 --> 51:51.328
(audience whooping)
(audience applauding)

51:51.328 --> 51:55.550
I don't have some fake-ass
college con to pay off.

51:55.550 --> 51:57.430
I have never paid off a porn star,

51:57.430 --> 51:59.783
but I have been paid by one.

52:06.151 --> 52:07.650
I'm only on my second wife.

52:07.650 --> 52:11.911
And I only grab pussy
when it asks politely,

52:11.911 --> 52:14.922
(loud cheering)

52:14.922 --> 52:18.005
which is the number one rule of that.

52:21.070 --> 52:22.980
I'm also not part of
any group, either, man.

52:22.980 --> 52:23.813
You know, I'm not.

52:23.813 --> 52:24.827
I'm not part of any Dem/Repub or whatever.

52:24.827 --> 52:26.110
And no one's paying me.

52:26.110 --> 52:28.773
I'm here and it's 115 degrees in Arizona.

52:30.212 --> 52:32.640
Yeah, I'm a pure America, 100%, man.

52:32.640 --> 52:33.480
You know, I'm not part of any group.

52:33.480 --> 52:34.730
I believe what Groucho Marx said:

52:34.730 --> 52:35.980
I would never be part of any group

52:35.980 --> 52:37.530
that would have me as a member.

52:38.390 --> 52:39.477
Great joke.

52:39.477 --> 52:41.160
You know, I did try to
join Black Lives Matter.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.553
That was a long interview, man.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.470
But a good leader listens,

52:46.470 --> 52:47.320
so I went to a couple meetings

52:47.320 --> 52:48.153
and I sat there and I just listened

52:48.153 --> 52:48.986
to what they were talking.

52:48.986 --> 52:50.800
When they said how do we
stop being mad about slavery?

52:50.800 --> 52:52.400
I said, let's have a white sale.

52:53.856 --> 52:55.730
Yeah, it didn't...

52:55.730 --> 52:57.687
Yeah, it didn't...

52:57.687 --> 53:00.357
It didn't go the way I
thought it would, you know?

53:00.357 --> 53:01.820
And I thought it was real funny,

53:01.820 --> 53:02.860
'cause it was also Easter.

53:02.860 --> 53:03.710
That's hilarious.

53:06.490 --> 53:07.670
I'm not a racist or bigot.

53:07.670 --> 53:09.710
The only people I think
should be killed instantly

53:09.710 --> 53:11.960
are family law attorneys
and Toyota Prius drivers.

53:11.960 --> 53:13.110
That's it, right there.

53:14.877 --> 53:17.070
I'm sorry, you Toyota Prius people,

53:17.070 --> 53:19.170
do you know what you do to the highways,

53:19.170 --> 53:20.003
do you have any?

53:20.003 --> 53:20.836
You just screw things up,

53:20.836 --> 53:22.640
they you clear it, and we all go, uh.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.480
And then you come back.

53:23.480 --> 53:26.270
You're like the herpes of the
highway, that's what you are.

53:27.250 --> 53:29.980
Here are three things you are
never gonna hear in your life:

53:29.980 --> 53:32.113
whoa, look at that bad-ass Prius.

53:34.185 --> 53:35.397
Whoa, that Prius is hauling ass

53:35.397 --> 53:37.523
and that driver seems so competent.

53:39.380 --> 53:42.130
Dude, I got my new Prius,
bring on the ladies.

53:44.715 --> 53:47.035
Three things never heard.

53:47.035 --> 53:49.490
I do blame the Prius for
part of the election.

53:49.490 --> 53:51.180
Here's the thing, I did not understand

53:51.180 --> 53:52.440
about why people were frustrated.

53:52.440 --> 53:53.810
They keep talking about
everyone's frustrated.

53:53.810 --> 53:55.360
Well, you look at the history,

53:55.360 --> 53:57.430
eight years before this last election,

53:57.430 --> 54:01.430
our economy had crashed,
and then at the end of that,

54:01.430 --> 54:02.390
housing had gone up.

54:02.390 --> 54:05.330
It was 20% higher than
it was before the crash,

54:05.330 --> 54:07.090
and the stock market had tripled,

54:07.090 --> 54:09.580
and unemployment had gone from 12% to 5%.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.200
We'd saved General Motors and Chrysler.

54:11.200 --> 54:12.180
Bin Laden got killed.

54:12.180 --> 54:13.340
Why were people frustrated?

54:13.340 --> 54:14.343
Toyota Prius.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.460
Every Prius I've ever been
behind at a stoplight,

54:20.460 --> 54:21.293
that light turns green,

54:21.293 --> 54:23.913
takes at least six seconds to drive away.

54:24.830 --> 54:25.947
Doesn't sound like a lot, does it?

54:25.947 --> 54:29.820
You're behind that idiot: One, two, three,

54:29.820 --> 54:31.847
four, five, go!

54:32.699 --> 54:34.222
(audience laughing)

54:34.222 --> 54:37.389
(audience applauding)

54:39.490 --> 54:42.290
20 million Priuses on the
road, 200 million drivers,

54:42.290 --> 54:45.490
that means a lot of us are
behind these idiots all the time,

54:45.490 --> 54:46.999
and after a day of it, you don't
know what's wrong with you,

54:46.999 --> 54:47.910
you're just in a bad mood,

54:47.910 --> 54:48.743
and you get home and your wife goes,

54:48.743 --> 54:49.576
what's the matter with you?

54:49.576 --> 54:51.070
I don't know, it just feels
like I can't get anywhere

54:51.070 --> 54:52.960
in America anymore, you know?

54:52.960 --> 54:54.200
I just can't get ahead.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.050
I'm stopped at every turn, goddammit.

54:56.050 --> 54:57.180
I don't know what to do.

54:57.180 --> 55:00.540
I'm gonna vote for a
reality television star.

55:00.540 --> 55:01.633
Is Snooki running?

55:03.438 --> 55:04.271
-  I'd run.

55:04.271 --> 55:06.710
- Then sweet potato Hitler it is.

55:06.710 --> 55:09.349
(audience laughing)

55:09.349 --> 55:11.683
Yeah, I know, too rough, too far, too far.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.420
And in fact, if I could get
two family law attorneys

55:16.420 --> 55:17.253
go get in opposing Priuses

55:17.253 --> 55:19.460
and have an 80 mile-an-hour
head-on collision,

55:19.460 --> 55:21.543
oh, that would make me hard.

55:28.690 --> 55:29.560
I'm a pure American.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.360
I love capitalism and democracy.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.720
Yeah, that's why I should be
a good president, you know?

55:32.720 --> 55:35.420
I hate communism, any
ideology where you have

55:35.420 --> 55:38.100
to wait in line for toilet
paper is very oppressive

55:38.100 --> 55:39.873
and very pro skid mark.

55:42.543 --> 55:44.130
I also don't believe in
trickle-down economics.

55:44.130 --> 55:44.963
I had to read about it, though.

55:44.963 --> 55:45.950
I've been hearing about it since Reagan.

55:45.950 --> 55:47.290
I actually spent three weeks,

55:47.290 --> 55:49.020
I can break down trickle-down economics

55:49.020 --> 55:50.410
to you guys in one sentence.

55:50.410 --> 55:51.525
Are you ready?
- No.

55:51.525 --> 55:52.370
(audience member whoops)

55:52.370 --> 55:56.030
- If we give rich people more money,

55:56.030 --> 55:58.623
they will give it to poor people.

56:03.370 --> 56:04.520
Even the poorly-educated are like,

56:04.520 --> 56:06.353
well, that sound like bullshit.

56:07.904 --> 56:10.373
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

56:10.373 --> 56:11.206
Anyway.

56:13.980 --> 56:14.980
How 'bout you give it to us,

56:14.980 --> 56:15.980
we'll trickle it up.

56:18.920 --> 56:20.520
Only trickle-down I believe in

56:20.520 --> 56:23.903
is when I leave the men's
room wearing light gray pants.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.227
I've witnessed that one.

56:29.236 --> 56:30.069
I'm not a Libertarian either,

56:30.069 --> 56:31.300
although in a Titus administration,

56:31.300 --> 56:32.480
we're gonna bring the size of government

56:32.480 --> 56:34.240
down a little bit, but these
hard-core Libertarians?

56:34.240 --> 56:35.780
I don't want any government in my life!

56:35.780 --> 56:39.480
Good, when I steal your
car, don't call the cops.

56:39.480 --> 56:40.710
Your house is on fire.

56:40.710 --> 56:41.723
That's a bitch.

56:44.010 --> 56:45.160
No, I'd call the fire department,

56:45.160 --> 56:47.650
but I don't want to
screw with your beliefs.

56:47.650 --> 56:50.150
Oo, that insulation makes
a pretty blue, don't it?

56:54.351 --> 56:57.103
I didn't say I wasn't gonna
be a asshole president.

56:59.780 --> 57:00.970
(laughing)

57:00.970 --> 57:01.933
When it comes to legislate,

57:01.933 --> 57:03.600
oh, and by the way, I'm
not a socialist either.

57:03.600 --> 57:05.130
When did socialist become an insult?

57:05.130 --> 57:05.963
Socialist!

57:05.963 --> 57:07.240
Do you guys know what socialism is?

57:07.240 --> 57:09.430
We all work together,
especially democratic socialism,

57:09.430 --> 57:10.680
you work hard, really together,

57:10.680 --> 57:12.770
and we all share, and we
all build each other up.

57:12.770 --> 57:14.730
That's what it is, no one gets
$1 billion, no one gets $1.

57:14.730 --> 57:15.640
That's socialism.

57:15.640 --> 57:18.010
I think it's the -ism that
bothers people, you know?

57:18.010 --> 57:20.373
Communism, racism, you know?

57:21.740 --> 57:22.960
Nazism.

57:22.960 --> 57:25.810
I want to change your name to social-gasm

57:25.810 --> 57:26.911
and we all get off.

57:26.911 --> 57:27.962
(audience laughing)

57:27.962 --> 57:29.873
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

57:29.873 --> 57:31.395
Yeah.

57:31.395 --> 57:33.191
There you go.

57:33.191 --> 57:35.760
Then, then try to use it as an insult.

57:35.760 --> 57:36.593
Social-gasmist!

57:36.593 --> 57:38.663
Uh, uh, yeah.

57:40.960 --> 57:42.366
Sorry, I got a little trickle-down.

57:42.366 --> 57:45.770
(audience laughing)

57:45.770 --> 57:47.010
When it comes to legislation

57:47.010 --> 57:48.370
in the Titus Administration,

57:48.370 --> 57:50.080
we're not gonna legislate
where you go to the bathroom.

57:50.080 --> 57:52.170
You look like a dude,
pee where the dudes pee.

57:52.170 --> 57:53.700
You look like a chick,
pee where the chicks pee.

57:53.700 --> 57:55.340
If you don't, go behind
the Dumpster, weirdo,

57:55.340 --> 57:57.303
you're creeping everybody out.

57:59.324 --> 58:01.370
And when it comes to
gay troops in America,

58:01.370 --> 58:03.380
I'm sorry you wanna step
in front of a bullet

58:03.380 --> 58:04.420
to protect our freedom?

58:04.420 --> 58:06.323
God bless, thank you very
much for doing that for us.

58:06.323 --> 58:10.573
(crowd cheering drowns out speech)

58:14.170 --> 58:16.520
And transgender troops?

58:16.520 --> 58:18.440
I want transgenders in the military.

58:18.440 --> 58:19.273
Are you kidding me?

58:19.273 --> 58:21.440
You had the balls to
cut off your own balls?

58:21.440 --> 58:22.523
That's pretty ballsy.

58:24.710 --> 58:27.803
I'm sorry, that's a committed
individual right there.

58:28.800 --> 58:30.740
Titus, who's the bravest
man in your platoon?

58:30.740 --> 58:31.573
Linda.

58:36.485 --> 58:39.068
And I will follow him anywhere.

58:40.230 --> 58:42.013
In fact, I'm gonna
draft transgender people

58:42.013 --> 58:45.053
into the military and form
elite groups of trans Seals.

58:46.320 --> 58:48.823
And we will never go to war ever again.

58:49.710 --> 58:51.740
We are going to kill
the infidel Americans.

58:51.740 --> 58:52.790
Who are they sending over?

58:52.790 --> 58:54.005
Well, sir, intelligence tells us

58:54.005 --> 58:55.620
they're sending over the trans Seals.

58:55.620 --> 58:57.930
Ah, who are these trans Seals?

58:57.930 --> 58:59.630
Sir, it's a group of people
who cut off their testicles

58:59.630 --> 59:00.540
and sewed up their vaginas.

59:00.540 --> 59:02.823
Ah, they were prisoners,
it was punishment.

59:04.390 --> 59:05.223
No.

59:09.960 --> 59:12.760
They asked to have it done,
then paid for it themselves.

59:21.864 --> 59:26.864
(audience applauding)
(audience laughing)

59:35.520 --> 59:37.251
Changing hearts and minds, bitches.

59:37.251 --> 59:39.490
(chuckling)

59:39.490 --> 59:41.330
That trans Seal bit I did,

59:41.330 --> 59:42.250
first time I wrote it, I was doing it

59:42.250 --> 59:44.830
at the Downtown Club here
in Arizona, in Phoenix

59:44.830 --> 59:45.990
and I did it.

59:45.990 --> 59:47.330
Next day, my Facebook lights up

59:47.330 --> 59:49.480
with this mom flipping
out, five paragraphs.

59:49.480 --> 59:51.670
Oh my God, my son is
trans, and he loved you,

59:51.670 --> 59:52.503
you're his favorite comedian.

59:52.503 --> 59:53.820
And since you, that trans bit,

59:53.820 --> 59:55.980
he hates you now, and
he wants you to know.

59:55.980 --> 59:58.463
It's not a mutilation, it's a restoration.

1:00:00.283 --> 1:00:02.420
(heavy sighing)

1:00:02.420 --> 1:00:05.300
Well, restoration means you put it back

1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:06.600
the way it was originally.

1:00:10.460 --> 1:00:12.883
At best, it's a renovation.

1:00:18.691 --> 1:00:21.177
And you really just
remodeled the bathroom.

1:00:21.177 --> 1:00:22.859
(audience laughing)

1:00:22.859 --> 1:00:25.140
(audience applauding)

1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:27.390
Oh, yeah, call out everybody.

1:00:28.996 --> 1:00:31.820
Oh, so as president, I'm
gonna give you a country

1:00:31.820 --> 1:00:33.230
with a little more automatic healthcare,

1:00:33.230 --> 1:00:34.460
a little less automatic weapons,

1:00:34.460 --> 1:00:36.570
a country where facts trump opinion,

1:00:36.570 --> 1:00:39.070
and facts about Trump
change your fucking opinion.

1:00:40.870 --> 1:00:42.640
I'll bring you a country where known liars

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:44.800
are convicted instead of elected,

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:46.530
in a country where sexual predators

1:00:46.530 --> 1:00:48.210
are putting in prison, with much bigger,

1:00:48.210 --> 1:00:49.977
angrier sexual predators.

1:00:49.977 --> 1:00:53.240
(audience cheering)

1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:57.312
I'm gonna bring you a country
where women are heard.

1:00:57.312 --> 1:00:59.770
(loud cheering)

1:00:59.770 --> 1:01:02.010
Unless the game is on and
just give me 20 minutes.

1:01:02.010 --> 1:01:04.205
Fuck, I'm trying.

1:01:04.205 --> 1:01:06.530
It's the fourth quarter
why don't you just...

1:01:10.003 --> 1:01:12.270
A country where the poor
have a shot at being rich

1:01:12.270 --> 1:01:14.963
and the rich don't want the poor shot.

1:01:16.850 --> 1:01:18.440
That's an America I can believe in

1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:19.740
and that's an America I will bring you

1:01:19.740 --> 1:01:21.940
because that's an America I
was taught about in school

1:01:21.940 --> 1:01:24.980
when I wasn't paying attention.

1:01:24.980 --> 1:01:27.910
And that's who I'm gonna be
in 2018, thank you very much.

1:01:27.910 --> 1:01:32.130
Now, now...
(audience cheering)

1:01:32.130 --> 1:01:35.483
Why, why am I running in 2018?

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:37.600
'Cause I think the new guy is
gonna drop a deuce by Easter.

1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:38.433
I really do.

1:01:39.430 --> 1:01:40.980
It's getting weirder, isn't it?

1:01:41.900 --> 1:01:43.230
And I wanna talk to you
Liberals for a second,

1:01:43.230 --> 1:01:44.470
'cause, oh, I wanna talk about the check,

1:01:44.470 --> 1:01:47.160
'cause by the way, if
whatever side you're on

1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:50.210
you think, no, there's no
douche bags in your group,

1:01:50.210 --> 1:01:51.223
you're a douche bag.

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:54.790
The only way we get back to we

1:01:54.790 --> 1:01:56.330
is calling out everybody
on their bullshit.

1:01:56.330 --> 1:01:57.450
We can't just call it one side.

1:01:57.450 --> 1:01:59.050
Everybody gotta get called
out on their bullshit.

1:01:59.050 --> 1:01:59.883
That's how it goes, man.

1:01:59.883 --> 1:02:01.449
You know, I thought Trump was easy to get.

1:02:01.449 --> 1:02:03.420
And you Trump people
didn't do anything wrong.

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:04.790
And people are getting mad at you guys.

1:02:04.790 --> 1:02:07.100
You didn't know, you
didn't know there was,

1:02:07.100 --> 1:02:08.690
these guys voted for the guy they wanted.

1:02:08.690 --> 1:02:11.690
That's what you're supposed to
do as an American, you know?

1:02:11.690 --> 1:02:13.951
And you people that didn't
vote or voted for Harambe,

1:02:13.951 --> 1:02:17.360
(wry chuckling) when you
see that mushroom cloud

1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:19.093
over Phoenix, that shit's on you.

1:02:20.692 --> 1:02:22.300
What do you mean, that
doesn't look like a haboob.

1:02:22.300 --> 1:02:23.143
It is not.

1:02:27.260 --> 1:02:28.580
They just voted for the guy they wanted.

1:02:28.580 --> 1:02:29.950
That he ended up this guy is,

1:02:29.950 --> 1:02:31.310
you know, he's a professional conman.

1:02:31.310 --> 1:02:32.350
It's not their fault.

1:02:32.350 --> 1:02:33.390
And I thought he was easy to get.

1:02:33.390 --> 1:02:35.730
I was raised by an alcoholic
father and mentally ill mother.

1:02:35.730 --> 1:02:37.170
Who better to deal with Congress, lady?

1:02:37.170 --> 1:02:38.213
Thank you very much.

1:02:39.410 --> 1:02:40.650
Here's how easy Trump is to get.

1:02:40.650 --> 1:02:42.770
I have a 12-year-old
son and he's an idiot.

1:02:42.770 --> 1:02:43.603
Sorry.

1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:49.730
He's not an idiot, he's just 12.

1:02:49.730 --> 1:02:52.470
10- to 14-year-old boys
have this amazing ability

1:02:52.470 --> 1:02:53.760
where they can take their brains out,

1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:57.911
put them down and just walk away,

1:02:57.911 --> 1:02:59.390
(audience cheering)

1:02:59.390 --> 1:03:01.243
for weeks at a time.

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:03.920
All right, here's a story about my son.

1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:05.310
So, last year, he was in seventh grade.

1:03:05.310 --> 1:03:07.060
First through sixth grade,
when I had to pick him up,

1:03:07.060 --> 1:03:08.253
I had to wait in that
drop-off/pick-up line.

1:03:08.253 --> 1:03:10.160
Then I had to sign a piece of paper.

1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:11.420
Then they had to do a DNA test.

1:03:11.420 --> 1:03:13.260
They they had to do an iris scan.

1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:15.300
Then I could pick his ass up.

1:03:15.300 --> 1:03:17.570
Then he became a seventh-grader
and now he can just leave

1:03:17.570 --> 1:03:19.830
when he wants, 'cause
he's this much taller

1:03:19.830 --> 1:03:21.430
and nine pounds heavier.

1:03:21.430 --> 1:03:23.163
I guess he's a ninja now.

1:03:25.958 --> 1:03:26.791
But I was cool with that.

1:03:26.791 --> 1:03:28.760
You know why, 'cause I hated waiting

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.200
in that drop-off/pick-up line

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:32.850
with you chatty soccer
moms driving Priuses.

1:03:32.850 --> 1:03:34.413
Oh my God.

1:03:35.580 --> 1:03:37.650
I drive a Ram 1500 4-wheel drive,

1:03:37.650 --> 1:03:38.670
and you don't know how many times

1:03:38.670 --> 1:03:41.033
I played a monster truck
scenario in my head.

1:03:43.988 --> 1:03:45.988
I would just sit in
that line just thinking.

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:49.488
(imitates engine revving)

1:03:53.107 --> 1:03:55.163
How was today at school, son?

1:03:57.440 --> 1:03:59.167
So now I'm stoked that I
can, that I can get him.

1:03:59.167 --> 1:04:00.010
And I tell him that.

1:04:00.010 --> 1:04:01.800
I go, good, you can leave,
here's what I want you to do.

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:03.070
Cross the street, stand
in front of the church.

1:04:03.070 --> 1:04:04.180
He goes to a Christian school.

1:04:04.180 --> 1:04:05.890
Stand on the curb, I'll drive
up, pick you up, we're out.

1:04:05.890 --> 1:04:06.880
He goes, cool.

1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:08.420
First day I do it, it's raining in LA.

1:04:08.420 --> 1:04:09.253
I get up to freeway.

1:04:09.253 --> 1:04:11.120
I'm on the wrong side of the freeway.

1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:12.540
I got past this four-way stop,

1:04:12.540 --> 1:04:13.890
I pull to the curb.

1:04:13.890 --> 1:04:15.300
My son is four lanes away from me,

1:04:15.300 --> 1:04:16.690
directly across the street.

1:04:16.690 --> 1:04:19.778
I look out the window of
my truck and my son goes.

1:04:19.778 --> 1:04:22.778
(audience laughing)

1:04:33.545 --> 1:04:37.660
And we look at each other
for like a day and a half.

1:04:37.660 --> 1:04:38.547
And I finally roll my window down

1:04:38.547 --> 1:04:40.573
and I go, cross the street!

1:04:41.970 --> 1:04:43.260
Smart kid, he goes, got it, got it.

1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:45.500
He grabs his stuff, he goes to the corner.

1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:47.440
I'm right there.

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:48.520
He hits the button.

1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:53.273
This light turns green,
he crosses this street.

1:04:55.050 --> 1:04:58.013
Turns and realizes I'm
farther from dad, now.

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:02.530
Doesn't run back on the green.

1:05:02.530 --> 1:05:04.553
Hits the button to cross this street.

1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:15.890
And it was the first time it
came out of me involuntarily.

1:05:15.890 --> 1:05:17.900
I'd said it before when
he did something silly,

1:05:17.900 --> 1:05:19.720
but I was looking at the
rear view mirror of my truck,

1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:22.197
and I hear myself go, the fuck?

1:05:22.197 --> 1:05:27.197
(audience laughing)
(audience applauding)

1:05:29.580 --> 1:05:31.240
He waits for that light to change,

1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:33.300
crosses that street, turns and realizes

1:05:33.300 --> 1:05:35.613
he now has yet one more street to cross.

1:05:39.410 --> 1:05:41.230
He waits for that light to
change, cross the street,

1:05:41.230 --> 1:05:42.160
gets in my truck, and I go,

1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:42.993
what are you doin'?

1:05:42.993 --> 1:05:46.169
And he goes, "I know, right?"

1:05:46.169 --> 1:05:49.336
(audience applauding)

1:05:53.588 --> 1:05:55.755
Which I count as progress,

1:05:56.990 --> 1:05:59.490
because he didn't used to
know when he was stupid.

1:06:00.577 --> 1:06:01.970
'Member, guys, you hit about 13

1:06:01.970 --> 1:06:04.950
and you were like, oh
my God, what am I doing?

1:06:04.950 --> 1:06:07.933
I'm never gonna touch a
girl if I keep this up.

1:06:09.470 --> 1:06:10.303
That's where my son is.

1:06:10.303 --> 1:06:11.540
So, I'm writing this new show,

1:06:11.540 --> 1:06:14.020
it was a while ago, and I'm
watching the news way too much.

1:06:14.020 --> 1:06:14.940
My family hates, 'cause,

1:06:14.940 --> 1:06:16.130
and just so you know, Trump people,

1:06:16.130 --> 1:06:17.130
I didn't wanna write this show,

1:06:17.130 --> 1:06:18.783
but it was on TV every night.

1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:22.140
Like, five things a day.

1:06:22.140 --> 1:06:26.180
Like, how do you screw
up 730 times in 500 days?

1:06:26.180 --> 1:06:27.590
The only people happy are Charlie Sheen

1:06:27.590 --> 1:06:31.160
and Lindsay Lohan, man, and Chris Brown.

1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:33.163
They're like, he beat
our record, all right.

1:06:34.070 --> 1:06:35.970
So, it's just comin' out
of me and I could not,

1:06:35.970 --> 1:06:36.803
that's what I do.

1:06:36.803 --> 1:06:37.636
My job is to observe and do.

1:06:37.636 --> 1:06:38.469
So, it's comin' out of me,

1:06:38.469 --> 1:06:39.930
but I'm watching the news all the time,

1:06:39.930 --> 1:06:41.550
and my family's like, why do
we want to watch the news?

1:06:41.550 --> 1:06:43.000
I was like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:43.833
You guys wanna eat?

1:06:43.833 --> 1:06:45.135
I gotta go to Phoenix.

1:06:45.135 --> 1:06:47.770
(audience laughing)

1:06:47.770 --> 1:06:49.460
And it's 115 degrees!

1:06:50.975 --> 1:06:52.280
(audience whooping)

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.240
So, I'm watching the news one night.

1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.073
I'm just writing.

1:06:55.073 --> 1:06:57.215
My son's sitting next to me on the couch.

1:06:57.215 --> 1:06:58.720
And here's how easy Trump is to get.

1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:02.247
Out of the blue, my son
just turns and goes,

1:07:02.247 --> 1:07:05.008
"How is Mexico gonna pay for the wall?"

1:07:05.008 --> 1:07:06.715
(audience laughing)

1:07:06.715 --> 1:07:09.882
(audience applauding)

1:07:18.860 --> 1:07:20.493
I love you so much right now.

1:07:22.870 --> 1:07:24.593
No, I thought I was crazy.

1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:28.660
I don't know, son, maybe we're
gonna get free landscaping

1:07:28.660 --> 1:07:30.850
at the White House for
a while, I don't know.

1:07:31.790 --> 1:07:33.893
Maybe we'll send 'em an invoice.

1:07:35.140 --> 1:07:38.814
If they don't pay it, I guess
we'll just ruin their credit.

1:07:38.814 --> 1:07:41.260
(laughing)

1:07:41.260 --> 1:07:42.843
We'll be Mexico's ex-wife.

1:07:45.350 --> 1:07:47.270
Don't tell your mom I said that.

1:07:51.850 --> 1:07:53.110
You Trump people gotta
be tired of hearing,

1:07:53.110 --> 1:07:54.151
the wall thing is getting so weird.

1:07:54.151 --> 1:07:55.440
The weirdest thing I heard about the wall

1:07:55.440 --> 1:07:57.210
was when Spicer was still in.

1:07:57.210 --> 1:07:58.197
Spicer came out and he goes,

1:07:58.197 --> 1:08:01.113
"Part of the wall is gonna be invisible."

1:08:01.113 --> 1:08:04.440
(audience laughing)

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:05.570
Even the poorly-educated were like,

1:08:05.570 --> 1:08:07.273
aw, come on, man.

1:08:08.430 --> 1:08:11.683
We're poorly-educated, we
believe in Spandex, not magic.

1:08:15.210 --> 1:08:16.590
And here's the sad part
for these Trump people.

1:08:16.590 --> 1:08:18.070
You guys don't know, they now,

1:08:18.070 --> 1:08:19.820
whatever he says, however crazy,

1:08:19.820 --> 1:08:20.653
they gotta back him up.

1:08:20.653 --> 1:08:23.160
I got fans in Texas, on the border.

1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:24.320
They got invisible wall?

1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:25.380
Yep, they built it this morning.

1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:28.331
Look at that son of a
bitch, right there, yeah.

1:08:28.331 --> 1:08:31.093
320 foot invisible wall.

1:08:32.730 --> 1:08:35.090
You gonna go invisible go big, am I right?

1:08:36.163 --> 1:08:37.900
That's a high-tech sum-bitch right there.

1:08:37.900 --> 1:08:39.190
Ain't nothin' through that, 'cept for

1:08:39.190 --> 1:08:40.560
that little Mexican feller right there.

1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:41.628
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:08:41.628 --> 1:08:44.628
(audience laughing)

1:08:49.140 --> 1:08:51.933
Rusty, check the fuse box
on the invisible wall.

1:08:56.270 --> 1:08:57.103
And you voted for the guy.

1:08:57.103 --> 1:08:57.936
You know what, you Trump people,

1:08:57.936 --> 1:08:59.730
you voted for the man,
you deserve your wall,

1:08:59.730 --> 1:09:00.820
to the victor goes this wall.

1:09:00.820 --> 1:09:02.410
In fact, you know what, I
want the wall built now,

1:09:02.410 --> 1:09:03.520
'cause every four years after that,

1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:05.877
the Olympics, we are gonna
kick ass in handball.

1:09:05.877 --> 1:09:09.018
(audience laughing)

1:09:09.018 --> 1:09:09.851
I mean, we're always gonna have

1:09:09.851 --> 1:09:11.423
to play Mexico in the finals,

1:09:15.939 --> 1:09:17.149
(sporadic applause)

1:09:17.149 --> 1:09:19.260
because they also have a wall.

1:09:20.670 --> 1:09:23.375
Nine is the number after eight.

1:09:23.375 --> 1:09:24.866
(audience applauding)

1:09:24.866 --> 1:09:25.699
Yeah.

1:09:30.775 --> 1:09:32.870
And I can prove that no
matter who you voted for,

1:09:32.870 --> 1:09:34.140
we're all the same in
this country right now.

1:09:34.140 --> 1:09:35.250
You know why?

1:09:35.250 --> 1:09:36.620
Everyone in this room has had someone

1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:38.340
come up to them and say, did
you hear what he said today?

1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:40.490
And then they tell you,
and you go, no way.

1:09:41.780 --> 1:09:44.130
And then you turn on the
TV and you go, dammit.

1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:47.610
Every single one of us. (stammering)

1:09:47.610 --> 1:09:49.060
There was something that he said

1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:50.290
about the wall that I didn't believe,

1:09:50.290 --> 1:09:52.600
and then my wife and I
were driving somewhere

1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:53.700
and listening to the Alabama speech,

1:09:53.700 --> 1:09:54.780
the primary speech, when Roy Moore

1:09:54.780 --> 1:09:56.380
was against the other guy,

1:09:56.380 --> 1:09:58.490
and we have to give Alabama some props

1:09:58.490 --> 1:10:00.440
'cause we finally found out their line:

1:10:01.340 --> 1:10:03.033
racist, homophobic pedophile.

1:10:04.370 --> 1:10:05.483
They were like, nope.

1:10:06.530 --> 1:10:08.833
You can hate, just don't fuck kids,

1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:12.867
which is their new license plates.

1:10:12.867 --> 1:10:15.867
(audience laughing)

1:10:22.507 --> 1:10:24.076
So, good job, Alabama.

1:10:24.076 --> 1:10:25.909
So, good job, Alabama.

1:10:29.230 --> 1:10:30.280
So, we're listening to the speech

1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:31.700
and he says this, and I, honest,

1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:32.533
I had to play it again.

1:10:32.533 --> 1:10:33.410
I was like, well, what the hell is that?

1:10:33.410 --> 1:10:34.887
He said, about the wall, he goes,

1:10:34.887 --> 1:10:37.290
"The wall needs to be see-through

1:10:38.217 --> 1:10:41.797
"because drug dealers will
take 100-pound bags of drugs

1:10:41.797 --> 1:10:45.653
"put 'em on catapults, and
shoot 'em over the wall.

1:10:46.717 --> 1:10:50.247
"And they may hit innocent
Americans in the head."

1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:56.940
My first thought was, my God,

1:10:56.940 --> 1:10:59.190
The Three Stooges have
started a drug cartel.

1:11:03.876 --> 1:11:07.360
Is that how El Chapo
made his billions, is it?

1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:10.410
Is that how the Sinaloa
cartel just took over Mexico?

1:11:10.410 --> 1:11:11.243
Is that?

1:11:11.243 --> 1:11:12.600
They have a big meeting one day?

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:15.193
Okay, everybody, welcome to the meeting.

1:11:18.410 --> 1:11:21.423
I have a new bitching
idea to smuggle the drugs.

1:11:23.260 --> 1:11:25.413
No more tunnels, my fingers hurt.

1:11:32.617 --> 1:11:34.534
Are you ready for this?

1:11:36.410 --> 1:11:38.363
We gonna build a catapult.

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.553
No, not a trebuchet.

1:11:47.693 --> 1:11:49.310
Catapult.

1:11:49.310 --> 1:11:51.343
I not going to argue with you anymore.

1:11:54.070 --> 1:11:58.543
Then, we going to take
100-pound bags of drugs,

1:12:01.190 --> 1:12:02.423
put 'em in the catapult,

1:12:04.380 --> 1:12:08.043
And then, we gonna shoot 'em

1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:13.093
over the invisible wall.

1:12:17.260 --> 1:12:22.260
Now, we may need to get
some liability insurance

1:12:26.995 --> 1:12:30.707
in case we hit innocent
Americans in the head

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.453
who are vacationing near the wall.

1:12:36.910 --> 1:12:38.120
Okay, everybody in.

1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:38.953
Drug dealers!

1:12:38.953 --> 1:12:40.091
Okay.

1:12:40.091 --> 1:12:45.091
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

1:12:46.350 --> 1:12:48.516
That was stupid.

1:12:48.516 --> 1:12:50.891
So stupid, thank you.

1:12:50.891 --> 1:12:53.141
(laughing)

1:12:54.239 --> 1:12:55.290
And here's the other thing about Trump.

1:12:55.290 --> 1:12:57.150
If Trump was a nice guy,
it'd be easier to take.

1:12:57.150 --> 1:12:58.470
You know, we've dumb guys in there before

1:12:58.470 --> 1:12:59.460
that were nice guys,

1:12:59.460 --> 1:13:01.020
you know, guys that
weren't that smart about,

1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:01.950
I met George W.

1:13:01.950 --> 1:13:02.950
George W's a really nice guy.

1:13:02.950 --> 1:13:03.783
I like W.

1:13:03.783 --> 1:13:05.070
You know, I didn't agree
with him on anything

1:13:05.070 --> 1:13:05.940
but I liked him.

1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:07.300
I got to meet him, I got
to do a show for him,

1:13:07.300 --> 1:13:10.040
a Christmas special with ABC,
and I had to do the comedy.

1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:11.680
It was at Ford's Theater,
where Lincoln got shot

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:14.070
which is weird 'cause
the booth is right there.

1:13:14.070 --> 1:13:16.400
It's 12 feet from you and they
don't let anybody sit there

1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:18.364
'cause I guess they
haven't caught the guy.

1:13:18.364 --> 1:13:19.910
(audience laughing)

1:13:19.910 --> 1:13:21.630
Or they're still doing forensics.

1:13:21.630 --> 1:13:23.080
I don't know what's going on.

1:13:24.300 --> 1:13:27.160
So, they asked me to the
show, and I said yeah.

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:29.080
Iraq was going on, I said,
can I do my Iraq material?

1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:30.557
And they went, "No."

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:32.940
And I said, no, no,
it's not about the war,

1:13:32.940 --> 1:13:33.990
it's about the troops, and they said okay.

1:13:33.990 --> 1:13:36.160
Sure, they cleared it, 'cause
I went to Iraq a couple times.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:38.300
And when I would go to
Iraq, I'd get these gigs,

1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:39.510
I'd call other comedians and I'd go,

1:13:39.510 --> 1:13:40.780
dude, we're gonna go do shows

1:13:40.780 --> 1:13:41.613
for the troops in Iraq, you wanna go?

1:13:41.613 --> 1:13:43.420
And every comedian said, hell, yeah.

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:45.130
And then, I'd call 'em
two week before we leave.

1:13:45.130 --> 1:13:45.963
We're leaving in two weeks.

1:13:45.963 --> 1:13:47.244
I'm not going to Iraq.

1:13:47.244 --> 1:13:48.897
(audience laughing)

1:13:48.897 --> 1:13:52.080
I'm gonna go to Tempe, Arizona
where it feels like Iraq

1:13:53.381 --> 1:13:58.381
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

1:14:00.210 --> 1:14:01.363
except with old people.

1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:06.030
So, the last time I went, I
invited this guy named Everlast.

1:14:06.030 --> 1:14:07.501
I got to meet him.

1:14:07.501 --> 1:14:09.100
Everlast's a great musician,
he did he Jump Around.

1:14:09.100 --> 1:14:10.510
And he's a great musician,

1:14:10.510 --> 1:14:12.810
and he was also raised
in Boston and East LA,

1:14:12.810 --> 1:14:13.960
so when I said, you wanna go to Iraq?

1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:16.327
He's like, yeah, do I bring
a gun, or can we rent?

1:14:16.327 --> 1:14:18.350
(audience laughing)

1:14:18.350 --> 1:14:20.080
He's legit.

1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:22.020
So, we go to Iraq, and any
soldiers in here, tonight?

1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:23.570
If you're in here tonight,
thank you for doing the job.

1:14:23.570 --> 1:14:24.680
I want you guys to know something.

1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:26.100
When you clap for the soldiers,

1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:28.250
I want you just not clap
because it's all rote.

1:14:28.250 --> 1:14:29.320
Think about what they went through.

1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:33.680
Iraq was the worst place
I've ever been to in my life.

1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:36.494
Imagine if Mars got colon cancer.

1:14:36.494 --> 1:14:38.680
(audience laughing).

1:14:38.680 --> 1:14:40.040
That's Iraq.

1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:41.190
Nothing there, and when
you get off the plane,

1:14:41.190 --> 1:14:42.360
it was so hot, it was.

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:43.390
Literally, it was like here,

1:14:43.390 --> 1:14:45.006
except you had, except danger.

1:14:45.006 --> 1:14:46.557
I was like (agonized groaning).

1:14:46.557 --> 1:14:47.580
And I get off the plane,

1:14:47.580 --> 1:14:49.550
and they had palates of
water on all the base,

1:14:49.550 --> 1:14:50.418
and they go, Titus, drink some water.

1:14:50.418 --> 1:14:51.330
I would go, no, I'm just hot.

1:14:51.330 --> 1:14:52.900
And then I go to the bathroom

1:14:52.900 --> 1:14:54.400
and above every latrine,

1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:57.690
there is a chart that shows
you where your pee should be,

1:14:57.690 --> 1:14:59.680
and it starts clear, then it goes Sprite,

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:02.210
and it goes Mountain
Dew, then it Mello Yello.

1:15:02.210 --> 1:15:04.823
And I was peeing Aunt Jemima
maple syrup down here.

1:15:06.890 --> 1:15:07.740
And the lieutenant was like,

1:15:07.740 --> 1:15:09.620
you're about eight minutes
from death, Mr. Titus.

1:15:09.620 --> 1:15:10.453
You better...

1:15:11.310 --> 1:15:12.690
Nobody should pee chunks.

1:15:12.690 --> 1:15:13.523
Let's go.

1:15:15.180 --> 1:15:17.970
And we did Fallujah, and we did Mosul,

1:15:17.970 --> 1:15:20.270
and we did Tikrit, and I was over there

1:15:20.270 --> 1:15:22.350
before Obama just gave it back.

1:15:22.350 --> 1:15:23.570
Goddammit.

1:15:23.570 --> 1:15:24.697
Oh I'm sorry, liberals, lighten up.

1:15:24.697 --> 1:15:25.733
$3 trillion?

1:15:26.917 --> 1:15:30.390
$3 trillion and we walked away?

1:15:30.390 --> 1:15:32.280
Could we at least leave Paul Blart here?

1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:33.113
Please? Maybe?

1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:38.010
You know, the yard
ladies at my high school

1:15:38.010 --> 1:15:41.160
coulda held off Isis
for a couple of weeks.

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:43.980
But Obama was like, nope,
George W. signed a treaty,

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:46.920
and we have to be out by 2014,

1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:48.750
and we're gonna honor that treaty.

1:15:48.750 --> 1:15:50.991
It's the first time we've
ever honored a treaty,

1:15:50.991 --> 1:15:53.280
(audience laughing)

1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:56.933
but we have to this time
because I'm the black guy.

1:16:02.063 --> 1:16:03.370
Yeah, you conservatives thought I was,

1:16:03.370 --> 1:16:05.070
yeah, eh, oh, that's a good point.

1:16:09.090 --> 1:16:11.347
So, we do our show, and we're in Mosul,

1:16:11.347 --> 1:16:12.530
and we get three days in Mosul.

1:16:12.530 --> 1:16:13.930
We have to stay in Mosul for three days,

1:16:13.930 --> 1:16:14.860
'cause they can't get us a flight.

1:16:14.860 --> 1:16:17.010
And staying in Mosul, Iraq is not,

1:16:17.010 --> 1:16:18.270
it's not Sandals, Iraq.

1:16:18.270 --> 1:16:19.620
It's not good, and it's just me

1:16:19.620 --> 1:16:21.447
and Everlast walking around the base.

1:16:21.447 --> 1:16:23.060
And the soldiers are like, guys,
don't walk around the base.

1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:26.250
If you're going to the, you
know, to eat, to the mess,

1:16:26.250 --> 1:16:27.460
you gotta move.

1:16:27.460 --> 1:16:28.590
And I'm like, why?

1:16:28.590 --> 1:16:29.556
And he's like, because.

1:16:29.556 --> 1:16:32.580
(initiates falling missile booming)

1:16:32.580 --> 1:16:34.120
We're a musician and a comedian.

1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:35.522
They were like, that's how
they explained it to us.

1:16:35.522 --> 1:16:38.680
(initiates falling missile booming)

1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:39.833
Oh.

1:16:42.090 --> 1:16:43.407
So, after our first day,
these soldiers show up,

1:16:43.407 --> 1:16:45.500
and they go, hey, we know you
guys got a couple days off.

1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:47.340
Hey, if we can get you
guys a chopper ride,

1:16:47.340 --> 1:16:49.920
will you guys go do a show
at a forward operating base?

1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:51.210
And I was like, hell, yeah!

1:16:51.210 --> 1:16:53.142
'Cause I didn't know what a
forward operating base was.

1:16:53.142 --> 1:16:56.142
(audience laughing)

1:16:57.090 --> 1:16:58.220
Here's where we are.

1:16:58.220 --> 1:17:00.230
Here's the forward operating base.

1:17:00.230 --> 1:17:01.480
Here's where we're going.

1:17:02.862 --> 1:17:03.695
Uh.

1:17:03.695 --> 1:17:04.528
And it was funny, we got in this,

1:17:04.528 --> 1:17:05.370
we had to get this Black Hawk

1:17:05.370 --> 1:17:06.480
and they got the doors blown of it.

1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:07.330
And they put on my flak vest.

1:17:07.330 --> 1:17:09.070
It's like 120 degrees, and it's hot.

1:17:09.070 --> 1:17:10.750
And I put on my metal hat.

1:17:10.750 --> 1:17:12.795
My helmet, I put on my helmet.

1:17:12.795 --> 1:17:16.300
(audience laughing)

1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:18.750
All right, that's a joke,
but it really happened.

1:17:19.970 --> 1:17:21.330
I was getting ready to get in the chopper.

1:17:21.330 --> 1:17:22.867
I had my flak vest on, and I
put it down, and I lost it,

1:17:22.867 --> 1:17:24.200
and I get in the chopper.

1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:25.630
I go, anybody seen my metal hat?

1:17:25.630 --> 1:17:26.930
And all the soldiers went,

1:17:27.889 --> 1:17:30.889
(audience laughing)

1:17:35.810 --> 1:17:37.563
did you just say metal hat, sir?

1:17:39.878 --> 1:17:42.463
'Cause it's made out of Kevlar
and we call it a helmet.

1:17:43.610 --> 1:17:45.460
Don't say metal hat again, okay, sir?

1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:48.307
'cause the doors are off this chopper and

1:17:48.307 --> 1:17:52.724
(initiates falling missile booming).

1:17:55.310 --> 1:17:57.550
So, we fly across the desert,
and we're flyin' forever.

1:17:57.550 --> 1:17:59.010
And we had to divert
around this sandstorm,

1:17:59.010 --> 1:18:01.910
which is amazing, 'cause we
landed, my face was so smooth.

1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:05.860
And we get close to
this, and we fly forever.

1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:07.150
And there's nothing there, it's desolate.

1:18:07.150 --> 1:18:07.983
What are we here for?

1:18:07.983 --> 1:18:09.970
There's just rocks,
and dirt, and no trees,

1:18:09.970 --> 1:18:11.150
and all of a sudden, in the distance,

1:18:11.150 --> 1:18:13.920
we see this town and it's
in the middle of nowhere.

1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:16.430
I mean there's no hills, water, nothing.

1:18:16.430 --> 1:18:17.700
What it looks like is people got pissed

1:18:17.700 --> 1:18:18.760
at the Mosul City Council, like,

1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:20.690
you know what, screw you.

1:18:20.690 --> 1:18:21.820
We're gonna start our own town!

1:18:21.820 --> 1:18:23.020
Come on, guys, let's go.

1:18:23.020 --> 1:18:24.810
And they started walking.

1:18:24.810 --> 1:18:27.810
And they walked a biblical distance,

1:18:27.810 --> 1:18:29.920
and somebody went, fuck it,
we're gonna build it right here.

1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:30.753
I don't care.

1:18:31.770 --> 1:18:34.070
Naw, my flip-flops are
all jacked up, I can't.

1:18:34.975 --> 1:18:37.796
No, I don't care what
the white Jesus says.

1:18:37.796 --> 1:18:40.796
(audience laughing)

1:18:43.510 --> 1:18:44.970
So, we're comin' in, and as you see,

1:18:44.970 --> 1:18:45.803
so there's a town over here,

1:18:45.803 --> 1:18:48.080
and then 400 yards away,
there's this big, giant complex.

1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:50.540
And we found later, that was
the old mayor of the town.

1:18:50.540 --> 1:18:52.940
He had this big giant mansion
and we commandeered it.

1:18:52.940 --> 1:18:54.100
I don't know what commandeered means,

1:18:54.100 --> 1:18:55.790
you're gonna have to
ask an American Indian.

1:18:55.790 --> 1:18:57.687
(audience laughing)

1:18:57.687 --> 1:19:02.687
(audience whooping)
(audience applauding)

1:19:03.318 --> 1:19:06.068
Titus, hysterical and historical.

1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:11.060
So, we come in and we land on the base,

1:19:11.060 --> 1:19:12.170
and we're inside.

1:19:12.170 --> 1:19:13.220
It's got these thick walls,

1:19:13.220 --> 1:19:14.300
and this little lieutenant
comes up to help.

1:19:14.300 --> 1:19:15.133
He's got little glasses.

1:19:15.133 --> 1:19:16.240
I go, it's Radar O'Reilly,

1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:19.260
and nobody knows what the
hell I'm talking about

1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:21.733
'cause they're 14 and I'm 1,007.

1:19:23.003 --> 1:19:24.350
And we get out, we get out of the chopper,

1:19:24.350 --> 1:19:27.410
and I look over and up
against the wall is a tank

1:19:27.410 --> 1:19:29.030
and the turret is pointed over the wall,

1:19:29.030 --> 1:19:30.820
directly at the town.

1:19:30.820 --> 1:19:31.800
And I go to the commander.

1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:32.940
I go, what's the deal with the tank?

1:19:32.940 --> 1:19:34.517
And he goes, "It's a reminder."

1:19:39.420 --> 1:19:41.030
That's how we're changing
hearts and minds.

1:19:41.030 --> 1:19:44.483
Ah, we're reminding them.

1:19:45.650 --> 1:19:46.483
So, the guy takes it,

1:19:46.483 --> 1:19:48.750
and I wanna say, you wanna
talk about being we the people?

1:19:48.750 --> 1:19:52.180
Every soldier I saw,
white, black, Hispanic,

1:19:52.180 --> 1:19:54.020
didn't matter whatever religion they were,

1:19:54.020 --> 1:19:55.050
all working together.

1:19:55.050 --> 1:19:56.360
You wanna talk about we?

1:19:56.360 --> 1:19:58.843
Those guys did it every day
and they were bad-ass at it.

1:19:58.843 --> 1:20:01.704
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

1:20:01.704 --> 1:20:06.704
And, so this lieutenant takes
up on the third balcony,

1:20:07.890 --> 1:20:08.723
and we're overlooking
the town in the distance,

1:20:08.723 --> 1:20:10.570
and he starts talking
about this town of Azrah

1:20:10.570 --> 1:20:11.640
that we're at and he goes,

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:13.563
this town of Azrah is one of
the smallest town in Iraq,

1:20:13.563 --> 1:20:15.440
and all the bad guys,
the worst of the worst

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:16.400
are coming here and hiding out,

1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:17.720
so we had to build his base here

1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:18.553
so we can go get 'em.

1:20:18.553 --> 1:20:19.790
And our guys go in every night,

1:20:19.790 --> 1:20:20.623
and they don't know
what's behind that door,

1:20:20.623 --> 1:20:22.330
and they kick the door
in and they're just,

1:20:22.330 --> 1:20:23.430
they're knockin' and rockin'.

1:20:23.430 --> 1:20:25.300
I was proud, I was like, yeah!

1:20:25.300 --> 1:20:28.113
And then my anus clenched shut.

1:20:30.090 --> 1:20:32.740
Like, I had this caveman
fear come up in me.

1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:33.900
I don't know what happened,

1:20:33.900 --> 1:20:36.460
but I turned around, and
about 20 feet behind us,

1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:38.640
this Special Ops guy had
walked out onto the balcony,

1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:40.040
but he wouldn't come out any further.

1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:41.870
And he didn't have a lot
of patches on his uniform.

1:20:41.870 --> 1:20:42.890
I don't know what unit he was in

1:20:42.890 --> 1:20:44.970
but, maybe, any military guy?

1:20:44.970 --> 1:20:47.290
The patch on his arm, it
was Satan raping a bear.

1:20:47.290 --> 1:20:48.123
I don't know.

1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:52.140
Anybody wanna fight those guys?

1:20:52.140 --> 1:20:53.590
I'm not fightin' those guys.

1:20:53.590 --> 1:20:54.760
And this guy was crazy.

1:20:54.760 --> 1:20:57.440
He was (stammering), he was an X-Men,

1:20:57.440 --> 1:20:59.140
that's what he was, he was a X-Men.

1:20:59.140 --> 1:21:00.700
He had the waist of a 12-year-old girl,

1:21:00.700 --> 1:21:01.920
like the shoulders of a Yeti.

1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:02.903
It was insane,

1:21:04.050 --> 1:21:05.480
and he was also calm, too.

1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:07.270
Now, every man in this
room who's been in a couple

1:21:07.270 --> 1:21:08.987
of bar fights, you know
the guys you can fight

1:21:08.987 --> 1:21:10.920
and the guys you can't fight.

1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:12.696
That guy that's goin',
come on, me and you,

1:21:12.696 --> 1:21:14.310
let's dance, let's do this!

1:21:14.310 --> 1:21:15.143
That guy?

1:21:15.143 --> 1:21:15.976
Get out your phones,

1:21:15.976 --> 1:21:17.580
He's getting his ass kicked,

1:21:17.580 --> 1:21:21.100
and it's gonna be hilarious.

1:21:21.100 --> 1:21:24.020
Then there's that other
guy that just goes,

1:21:24.020 --> 1:21:25.123
sure you wanna fight?

1:21:26.164 --> 1:21:29.164
(audience laughing)

1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:36.243
As a matter of fact, I apologize.

1:21:39.758 --> 1:21:40.800
(audience whooping)

1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:43.010
And this guy was calmer
than that guy, and very,

1:21:43.010 --> 1:21:44.173
he's standing 20 feet behind us

1:21:44.173 --> 1:21:45.710
on the edge of this balcony,

1:21:45.710 --> 1:21:47.013
and we're way out in the front of it,

1:21:47.013 --> 1:21:48.507
and he just goes, "Gentlemen,
would you guys mind

1:21:48.507 --> 1:21:50.760
"coming back here for a second, please?"

1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:53.570
So, Everlast turns, 'cause
in his voice, you heard it.

1:21:53.570 --> 1:21:55.220
Everlast walks past him, I walk past him,

1:21:55.220 --> 1:21:56.280
the lieutenant walks past him.

1:21:56.280 --> 1:21:57.130
As the the lieutenant walks over,

1:21:57.130 --> 1:21:58.470
he grabs the front of his shirt

1:21:58.470 --> 1:22:01.570
and part of his nipple,
'cause the kid made noise.

1:22:01.570 --> 1:22:03.637
The kid went, "Oh!"

1:22:03.637 --> 1:22:06.150
And now he's getting carry/dragged

1:22:06.150 --> 1:22:08.460
behind this wall, and the guy
slams him against the wall,

1:22:08.460 --> 1:22:10.033
and I said, I am not next.

1:22:12.490 --> 1:22:15.290
I'm blaming him, he brought us out here.

1:22:15.290 --> 1:22:16.553
And the guy doesn't pay
attention to me at all.

1:22:16.553 --> 1:22:18.167
Gets right in the kid's face, and he goes,

1:22:18.167 --> 1:22:20.427
"You do know there are snipers

1:22:20.427 --> 1:22:23.710
"in that town right now, right?"

1:22:23.710 --> 1:22:26.600
And Everlast goes, "Uh,
can I kick his ass?"

1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:29.710
(audience laughing)

1:22:29.710 --> 1:22:31.820
And the guy was like, no,
it's against Army regulations,

1:22:31.820 --> 1:22:33.920
plus I gotta rape him in a minute, anyway.

1:22:35.230 --> 1:22:37.980
Now, I didn't tell that story
at the Christmas special.

1:22:40.570 --> 1:22:41.870
So, here's what a nice guy W. is.

1:22:41.870 --> 1:22:43.320
I'm in front of him doing my show.

1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:44.670
It's going all right.

1:22:44.670 --> 1:22:46.180
W. and his wife, Laura are sitting there.

1:22:46.180 --> 1:22:47.450
In the middle of it, I go, Mr. President,

1:22:47.450 --> 1:22:48.860
I go, it's hard for me to
call you Mr. President.

1:22:48.860 --> 1:22:50.060
Can I just call you Hoss?

1:22:50.060 --> 1:22:51.367
- Hoss?
- Yeah.

1:22:51.367 --> 1:22:53.377
And the whole room goes
(imitates brakes squealing).

1:22:55.318 --> 1:22:56.470
I thought it would get a laugh

1:22:56.470 --> 1:22:58.430
not thinking that I just
called the President

1:22:58.430 --> 1:23:00.633
of the United States Hoss.

1:23:01.990 --> 1:23:03.407
And W. looks at me and goes,

1:23:03.407 --> 1:23:04.240
"Yeah, Hoss.

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.307
"I like that, go ahead
and call me Hoss, yeah."

1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:08.670
Then at the end of that show,

1:23:08.670 --> 1:23:09.780
we're all standing on stage behind him,

1:23:09.780 --> 1:23:11.250
and he goes to the mic to make a speech.

1:23:11.250 --> 1:23:12.437
And he walk up and he goes,
"How's everybody doin'?

1:23:12.437 --> 1:23:15.117
"Hoss here." (laughing)

1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:18.280
Then they invited me to the White House.

1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:19.610
I got to go to the White House?

1:23:19.610 --> 1:23:20.730
Make America Great Again?

1:23:20.730 --> 1:23:23.080
That's pretty, great, my God.

1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:24.250
And I had just got divorced.

1:23:24.250 --> 1:23:26.010
And met my new girl, and I got,

1:23:26.010 --> 1:23:27.380
married her, finally, by the way.

1:23:27.380 --> 1:23:30.720
My new wife is so far out
of my league is ridiculous.

1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:33.220
Yeah, here's out of my league my wife is.

1:23:33.220 --> 1:23:34.600
We'll be in an airport somewhere.

1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:35.690
She'll get up to go to the bathroom

1:23:35.690 --> 1:23:38.470
and guys I don't know will
walk over to me and go,

1:23:38.470 --> 1:23:41.140
dude, how did you land that?

1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:43.760
I'm like, I don't know, bro, I don't know.

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:46.260
I have no idea. (chuckling)

1:23:46.260 --> 1:23:48.143
And don't you say nothing to her,

1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:52.236
'cause she may not know this is weird.

1:23:52.236 --> 1:23:55.236
(audience laughing)

1:23:57.610 --> 1:23:58.530
So, I called her, I said,

1:23:58.530 --> 1:24:00.320
you wanna go on a date to The White House?

1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:03.553
No, not Waffle House, White House.

1:24:04.750 --> 1:24:05.860
She meets me there.

1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:07.780
She's got on a ball
gown, I've got a tuxedo.

1:24:07.780 --> 1:24:10.040
We're in line to get a picture

1:24:10.040 --> 1:24:12.230
with W. and his wife, Laura.

1:24:12.230 --> 1:24:14.503
And here's what a normal dude W. is.

1:24:15.390 --> 1:24:17.370
As we walk over, he glances, sees my girl,

1:24:17.370 --> 1:24:19.768
and goes, "All right,
things are looking up."

1:24:19.768 --> 1:24:21.754
(audience laughing)

1:24:21.754 --> 1:24:26.085
(audience whooping)
(audience applauding)

1:24:26.085 --> 1:24:29.502
And I was like, fist bump, Mr. President.

1:24:30.353 --> 1:24:31.467
He was like, "I told you to call me Hoss.

1:24:31.467 --> 1:24:32.597
"Call me Hoss."

1:24:34.300 --> 1:24:35.644
Nice man, nice man, even when you see him

1:24:35.644 --> 1:24:36.970
in interviews now, with
Clinton or whatever,

1:24:36.970 --> 1:24:38.900
he's just, he's self-deprecating,
he's a nice guy.

1:24:38.900 --> 1:24:41.740
On the other hand, our new guy hate tweets

1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:46.060
about civil rights leaders on
Martin Luther King weekend.

1:24:46.060 --> 1:24:47.100
Does he have a calendar?

1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:48.650
I'm gonna save this
tweet till next Saturday.

1:24:48.650 --> 1:24:50.050
Maybe that would make sense.

1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.170
He's gone after some of
America's most hated terrorists:

1:24:55.170 --> 1:24:56.263
Meryl Streep.

1:24:58.450 --> 1:25:00.270
Called Meryl Streep overrated.

1:25:00.270 --> 1:25:03.440
She's been nominated for
20 Oscars and won six.

1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:06.050
I'm sorry, you don't get to
talk to talk shit about anybody

1:25:06.050 --> 1:25:09.500
if your best skill is
bankruptcy and the comb over.

1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:14.500
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

1:25:15.417 --> 1:25:16.920
And Trump people, I want you to know

1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:18.600
I'm not giving you my
opinion, this is a fact.

1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:21.633
The man bankrupt four casinos.

1:25:23.380 --> 1:25:25.483
Do you know how casinos work?

1:25:30.530 --> 1:25:32.063
People walk into the casino.

1:25:33.930 --> 1:25:36.573
They hand over all their money.

1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:41.277
And then, they walk out of the casino.

1:25:41.277 --> 1:25:42.720
(audience applauding)

1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:46.290
(audience cheering)

1:25:46.290 --> 1:25:49.050
Somehow, he found the glitch in that.

1:25:59.637 --> 1:26:01.540
Ah, but again the problem
is liberals in our country

1:26:01.540 --> 1:26:02.670
and here's why.

1:26:02.670 --> 1:26:03.990
Here's why: liberals right now

1:26:03.990 --> 1:26:05.040
think they have the moral high ground.

1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:05.873
They're actually all thinking that.

1:26:05.873 --> 1:26:07.480
You know, these people are
stupid, they voted for Trump.

1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:09.590
They're not; they didn't know
he was gonna be this guy.

1:26:09.590 --> 1:26:11.530
And now because everyone's
talking shit online

1:26:11.530 --> 1:26:12.920
like a bunch of digital pussies,

1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:14.200
everyone's got their back up.

1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:15.870
You know, you can't say fuck you, dude.

1:26:15.870 --> 1:26:17.170
No one's gonna, oh, we're good, hug me.

1:26:17.170 --> 1:26:18.370
That's not what happens.

1:26:19.450 --> 1:26:20.480
We gotta learn to be cool.

1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:22.170
If we're gonna be we again.

1:26:22.170 --> 1:26:23.500
we got to be cool,
peoples making mistakes.

1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:24.710
My grandmother's 84 years old.

1:26:24.710 --> 1:26:25.543
She voted for Trump.

1:26:25.543 --> 1:26:27.460
We're playing cards over Christmas,

1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:29.380
and in the middle of playing cards,

1:26:29.380 --> 1:26:30.727
she just goes, "I wish this man

1:26:30.727 --> 1:26:32.904
"would just put down the tweeter."

1:26:32.904 --> 1:26:35.904
(audience laughing)

1:26:38.210 --> 1:26:39.610
Cannot believe a voter for this idiot.

1:26:39.610 --> 1:26:40.570
I made a mistake.

1:26:40.570 --> 1:26:41.860
And you know what I didn't do?

1:26:41.860 --> 1:26:43.333
Yeah, bitch!

1:26:43.333 --> 1:26:45.280
(audience laughing)
(audience applauding)

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:48.511
Yeah, why don't you suck on that, Grandma?

1:26:48.511 --> 1:26:49.344
Yeah.

1:26:56.490 --> 1:26:59.000
They know, liberals, they know.

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.181
They just don't know what to do about it.

1:27:01.181 --> 1:27:02.610
You know they gotta,
they're gonna ride it out,

1:27:02.610 --> 1:27:03.740
but they know, trust me.

1:27:03.740 --> 1:27:05.080
They go home.

1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:06.540
We're all the same, people, we're all,

1:27:06.540 --> 1:27:08.090
I can prove we're, every
one of us, the same.

1:27:08.090 --> 1:27:09.610
Every single one of us, in the morning,

1:27:09.610 --> 1:27:11.360
grabs our phone, hits the news feed,

1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:14.340
sees what he says, and says
exactly what Paul Ryan says.

1:27:14.340 --> 1:27:15.353
Fuck!

1:27:15.353 --> 1:27:18.650
(audience laughing)

1:27:18.650 --> 1:27:20.000
We're all the same.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:21.340
Every single one of us knows

1:27:21.340 --> 1:27:23.850
every time we see Kellyanne
Conway on the television

1:27:23.850 --> 1:27:25.500
that somewhere, she's got a coat

1:27:25.500 --> 1:27:27.199
made out of Dalmatian puppies.

1:27:27.199 --> 1:27:31.239
(audience laughing)
(audience applauding)

1:27:31.239 --> 1:27:32.189
We're all the same.

1:27:33.948 --> 1:27:34.781
There's no difference.

1:27:34.781 --> 1:27:35.614
We're all Americans, man.

1:27:35.614 --> 1:27:38.420
Everyone in this room
knows that from space,

1:27:38.420 --> 1:27:39.940
Trump's hair looks like Doppler radar

1:27:39.940 --> 1:27:41.267
during hurricane season.

1:27:41.267 --> 1:27:44.919
(audience laughing)
(audience whooping)

1:27:44.919 --> 1:27:47.473
How do you comb your hair
over from your neck, man?

1:27:49.130 --> 1:27:50.073
It's insane.

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.450
We're all the same 'cause
everybody in this room

1:27:53.450 --> 1:27:54.740
whether who you voted for,

1:27:54.740 --> 1:27:56.060
when he walked up the stairs that day

1:27:56.060 --> 1:27:57.613
and that whole thing went, baa.

1:27:59.508 --> 1:28:02.047
We all knew that's a Dr.
Evil moment, oh my God.

1:28:03.550 --> 1:28:05.460
And he's obviously part clam.

1:28:05.460 --> 1:28:06.513
What just happened?

1:28:10.660 --> 1:28:11.700
So, I want everyone to be cool

1:28:11.700 --> 1:28:12.660
with people's mistakes now.

1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:13.493
We're all gonna be,

1:28:13.493 --> 1:28:14.326
in fact, I'm gonna tell
you a story right now

1:28:14.326 --> 1:28:15.520
about one of the worst mistakes

1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:17.100
I have made in the last five years,

1:28:17.100 --> 1:28:18.280
and we're gonna laugh about it.

1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:19.830
And that's how we're gonna be
when someone says they voted.

1:28:19.830 --> 1:28:21.480
Anyone, next time they
go, dude, what happened?

1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:22.470
I can't believe I did this,

1:28:22.470 --> 1:28:23.390
you're not gonna get mad.

1:28:23.390 --> 1:28:24.513
You're not gonna be, oh, yeah, fuck you.

1:28:24.513 --> 1:28:25.630
He's not my president.

1:28:25.630 --> 1:28:26.870
Yeah, you live here, too, fucker.

1:28:26.870 --> 1:28:27.703
Yeah, he is.

1:28:27.703 --> 1:28:29.540
(audience laughing)
(audience applauding)

1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:30.910
By the way, you don't have to like it,

1:28:30.910 --> 1:28:31.987
but we gotta figure out how to fix it,

1:28:31.987 --> 1:28:34.070
and the only way that's
gonna happen is we.

1:28:34.070 --> 1:28:36.710
'Kay, so, I'm gonna tell you a story.

1:28:36.710 --> 1:28:37.543
And you guys, it's the worst thing

1:28:37.543 --> 1:28:38.854
I did in the last five years.

1:28:38.854 --> 1:28:42.280
(clears throat) I started
drinking when I was 15 years old.

1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:47.113
I stop drinking at 17 because
I fell into a bonfire.

1:28:47.113 --> 1:28:48.750
(audience laughing)

1:28:48.750 --> 1:28:50.155
Oh, I got really good at drinkin'.

1:28:50.155 --> 1:28:53.210
That's gold-medal level, right there.

1:28:53.210 --> 1:28:54.920
Alcoholics Anonymous sent me a certificate

1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:56.003
that just said wow.

1:28:57.984 --> 1:29:00.334
And then under that it
said, we can't help you.

1:29:01.180 --> 1:29:03.370
So, I stop drinking at 17 years old.

1:29:03.370 --> 1:29:04.290
I didn't drink again till I hit 41.

1:29:04.290 --> 1:29:07.110
I met my new girl, we're
at dinner one night,

1:29:07.110 --> 1:29:08.550
having dinner, and I had water.

1:29:08.550 --> 1:29:09.700
And she goes, "How come
you're not having a drink?"

1:29:09.700 --> 1:29:12.220
And I go, 'cause I fell into
a bonfire when I was 17.

1:29:12.220 --> 1:29:13.697
And she goes, "But you're not 17 anymore.

1:29:13.697 --> 1:29:15.107
"You're a grown-ass man."

1:29:16.312 --> 1:29:18.312
And I thought, wow, you're an alcoholic.

1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:21.953
She's said, "No, I'm just saying

1:29:21.953 --> 1:29:23.397
"you're not making the
decision of a child.

1:29:23.397 --> 1:29:24.690
"You're a grown man, have a drink."

1:29:24.690 --> 1:29:26.890
I go, do you run alcohol
distribution company?

1:29:26.890 --> 1:29:28.253
What is wrong with you?

1:29:29.110 --> 1:29:30.727
And then she said, "I'm
just saying a real man

1:29:30.727 --> 1:29:31.583
"would have a drink."

1:29:31.583 --> 1:29:33.083
-  Whoa!

1:29:35.210 --> 1:29:37.113
- She's from Louisiana, I said okay.

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:42.129
And she was showing a lot
of side boob, so I said yes.

1:29:42.129 --> 1:29:43.723
I am only flesh and blood.

1:29:45.252 --> 1:29:46.085
And she was right,

1:29:46.085 --> 1:29:46.918
I was an older man, different guy,

1:29:46.918 --> 1:29:47.751
have a different life.

1:29:47.751 --> 1:29:48.780
I had a drink, I'm fine.

1:29:48.780 --> 1:29:50.200
I can drink, it's good, everything's fine.

1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:52.380
Everything's fine,
yeah, yeah, I can drink.

1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:53.213
But...

1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:55.770
Recently, something happened.

1:29:55.770 --> 1:29:57.430
And by the way, and I'm
the worst kind of drunk,

1:29:57.430 --> 1:29:58.263
'cause I'm happy drunk.

1:29:58.263 --> 1:29:59.870
You can't piss me off.

1:29:59.870 --> 1:30:00.720
We'll be in a bar somewhere,

1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:02.060
someone's goin', what
the hell you lookin' at?

1:30:02.060 --> 1:30:03.955
Your hair is amazing.

1:30:03.955 --> 1:30:06.955
(audience laughing)

1:30:08.965 --> 1:30:10.460
Is that a mousse or a pomade,

1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:13.023
'cause you are beautiful, Brad Pitt.

1:30:14.515 --> 1:30:15.700
Oh, you wanna do me, homo?

1:30:15.700 --> 1:30:17.853
No, but we can get married legally now.

1:30:20.853 --> 1:30:22.915
Hell, I'll even bake you a cake.

1:30:22.915 --> 1:30:27.915
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

1:30:30.895 --> 1:30:33.040
(drunken laughing) I'm
gonna need a couple more

1:30:33.040 --> 1:30:33.890
of these, though,

1:30:34.990 --> 1:30:37.003
'cause I know my mouth is gorgeous.

1:30:39.870 --> 1:30:41.687
I'm the guy, when people
are dragging me out

1:30:41.687 --> 1:30:42.520
and I'm laughing at 'em,

1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:43.830
I'm like, what, we're just talking.

1:30:43.830 --> 1:30:44.740
No, he's gonna kill you.

1:30:44.740 --> 1:30:46.140
Why? What?

1:30:46.140 --> 1:30:46.973
Is he mad?

1:30:46.973 --> 1:30:48.020
Come on, gimme a hug.

1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:48.880
Come on, it's okay.

1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:50.512
Here, hug it out.

1:30:50.512 --> 1:30:52.262
Let's all hug it out.

1:30:54.710 --> 1:30:56.860
I'm a pain in the ass,
dude, I'm the worst.

1:30:58.200 --> 1:30:59.680
So, you know, I can
drink, everything's fine.

1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:02.510
So I got, but I got one, okay.

1:31:02.510 --> 1:31:05.550
So, a while back, I got home
from one of my road gigs

1:31:05.550 --> 1:31:07.330
and on Monday I take the
day off and I watch my shows

1:31:07.330 --> 1:31:08.183
on my DVR.

1:31:08.183 --> 1:31:10.590
I was watching Street
Outlaws, or whatever it is.

1:31:10.590 --> 1:31:12.173
And I had three glasses of wine.

1:31:12.173 --> 1:31:13.100
I had three, I had three.

1:31:13.100 --> 1:31:15.839
I poured a whole bottle
into three glasses of wine.

1:31:15.839 --> 1:31:17.486
(audience laughing)

1:31:17.486 --> 1:31:20.504
(audience applauding)

1:31:20.504 --> 1:31:21.730
And I drank it over three hours,

1:31:21.730 --> 1:31:23.823
he says to justify his behavior.

1:31:26.315 --> 1:31:27.670
I got done drinking, it was
three hours, I remembered.

1:31:27.670 --> 1:31:29.115
I went upstairs and my
wife was already in bed.

1:31:29.115 --> 1:31:29.948
And I get in bed.

1:31:29.948 --> 1:31:31.657
She goes, "Hey, your
throat sounds kinda raspy.

1:31:31.657 --> 1:31:33.688
"I want you to take this Benadryl."

1:31:33.688 --> 1:31:34.521
-  Oh.

1:31:34.521 --> 1:31:36.190
- I didn't know this part, see?

1:31:36.190 --> 1:31:37.330
This is the part.

1:31:37.330 --> 1:31:38.710
I don't take medication.

1:31:38.710 --> 1:31:41.520
I did not know that wine
plus wine, plus wine,

1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:44.413
plus Benadryl equals oh my God, no.

1:31:44.413 --> 1:31:47.037
(audience laughing)

1:31:47.037 --> 1:31:49.266
And that's the second math
joke I have ever written.

1:31:49.266 --> 1:31:50.592
(audience cheering)

1:31:50.592 --> 1:31:55.592
Thank you.

1:31:56.380 --> 1:31:57.780
So, I took the Benadryl 'cause I love her.

1:31:57.780 --> 1:32:00.330
Well, she can just hand
me anything, take this.

1:32:00.330 --> 1:32:02.670
Okay. (vocal burbling)

1:32:02.670 --> 1:32:03.913
Why am I foaming now?

1:32:05.301 --> 1:32:06.280
She's just counting money.

1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:07.380
No reason, keep going.

1:32:09.570 --> 1:32:11.590
People, I took that
Benadryl after that wine.

1:32:11.590 --> 1:32:14.543
I slept like I have
never slept in my life.

1:32:16.370 --> 1:32:18.013
Almost went into the light.

1:32:20.660 --> 1:32:23.580
Woke up the next morning like
I had a blood transfusion

1:32:23.580 --> 1:32:25.140
like I feel incredible!

1:32:25.140 --> 1:32:27.150
This must be what Oprah
and Keith Richards do.

1:32:27.150 --> 1:32:29.243
This is incredible, woo!

1:32:30.940 --> 1:32:33.340
But my house was weird.

1:32:33.340 --> 1:32:34.960
Like, my wife woke up, she was grumpy,

1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:35.989
but she wakes up grumpy sometimes.

1:32:35.989 --> 1:32:36.822
I didn't think about that,

1:32:36.822 --> 1:32:38.190
but my dogs were inconsistent

1:32:38.190 --> 1:32:39.160
and my dogs are very constant.

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:40.270
Every morning, I wake up,

1:32:40.270 --> 1:32:42.658
my older dog just face
rapes me for five minutes.

1:32:42.658 --> 1:32:44.330
That's what he does.

1:32:44.330 --> 1:32:45.790
This morning, though, he was sitting

1:32:45.790 --> 1:32:47.560
at the end of the bed as
far as he could get away

1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:48.493
from me, going.

1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:52.240
Our younger dog, who's the dark soul,

1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:54.463
he listens to Nine Inch
Nails all the time,

1:32:55.350 --> 1:32:56.710
usually under the bed shivering.

1:32:56.710 --> 1:32:58.550
This morning, however,
he's bouncing all over me

1:32:58.550 --> 1:33:00.680
like whatever I did last, we were buddies,

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:01.900
gonna hang out in the smoking area

1:33:01.900 --> 1:33:04.433
and carve our initials in our arm.

1:33:05.347 --> 1:33:06.190
I didn't think anything of it.

1:33:06.190 --> 1:33:07.490
I just went about my day.

1:33:07.490 --> 1:33:09.070
And my wife didn't say anything to me,

1:33:09.070 --> 1:33:10.810
but instead, as I'm going about my day,

1:33:10.810 --> 1:33:13.570
she started to noise me into an argument.

1:33:13.570 --> 1:33:14.630
Oh yeah, (stammering).

1:33:14.630 --> 1:33:16.310
She wouldn't say anything,
but I get my coffee,

1:33:16.310 --> 1:33:17.480
I'm walkin' down the hall,
and as she goes by me,

1:33:17.480 --> 1:33:18.500
she goes, (loud grumbling sighing).

1:33:21.890 --> 1:33:24.333
You should know what I'm doing right now.

1:33:27.657 --> 1:33:28.797
'Cause I walked past her two hours later

1:33:28.797 --> 1:33:31.087
and she just went, "Wow."

1:33:34.519 --> 1:33:35.352
And I'm not biting.

1:33:35.352 --> 1:33:36.450
I know what's coming, I'm not gonna bite.

1:33:36.450 --> 1:33:37.577
I just keep ignoring her.

1:33:37.577 --> 1:33:38.717
And two hours later, she walks past me

1:33:38.717 --> 1:33:41.437
and she just goes, "Unbelievable!"

1:33:42.409 --> 1:33:43.242
What?

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:46.057
And she whips on me and she goes,

1:33:46.057 --> 1:33:47.850
"Do you know what you did last night?"

1:33:47.850 --> 1:33:49.290
And that sentence is never followed

1:33:49.290 --> 1:33:51.572
by, you saved a baby from a fire.

1:33:51.572 --> 1:33:54.970
(audience applauding)
(audience laughing)

1:33:54.970 --> 1:33:56.720
You cured cancer, filed a patent,

1:33:56.720 --> 1:33:57.840
and we never have to work again.

1:33:57.840 --> 1:33:59.733
That's what you did last night!

1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:03.740
So, I sat down on the edge of the bed

1:34:05.910 --> 1:34:08.510
'cause I'd heard that
sentence before when I was 17,

1:34:09.890 --> 1:34:13.230
and I said, no, what did I do last night?

1:34:13.230 --> 1:34:14.063
And she said, "You were sleeping

1:34:14.063 --> 1:34:15.180
"like I've never seen you sleep."

1:34:15.180 --> 1:34:16.593
And I said, I remember that.

1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:21.337
She said, "About three a.m, you got up

1:34:21.337 --> 1:34:22.589
"to go to the bathroom."

1:34:22.589 --> 1:34:24.440
(audience chuckling)

1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:26.740
You shouldn't be that
far ahead of me on this.

1:34:31.677 --> 1:34:33.377
"You got up to go to the bathroom.

1:34:34.837 --> 1:34:36.483
"walked into the closet,

1:34:41.477 --> 1:34:45.923
"opened your pants, then
opened your pajama drawer,

1:34:48.577 --> 1:34:49.847
"and filled it."

1:34:54.381 --> 1:34:56.070
And I said, with what?

1:34:58.839 --> 1:35:01.439
Because I didn't want the
dogs to have one up on me.

1:35:04.210 --> 1:35:06.367
She said, "Then you pulled up your pants,

1:35:06.367 --> 1:35:09.807
"closed your pajama drawer, and flushed it

1:35:09.807 --> 1:35:12.080
"by flicking off the light switch."

1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:17.080
(audience laughing) (audience applauding)

1:35:22.282 --> 1:35:25.270
I peed in my pajama drawer.

1:35:25.270 --> 1:35:26.790
Now, I know a lot of
you are more weirded out

1:35:26.790 --> 1:35:28.190
that I have a pajama drawer,

1:35:30.630 --> 1:35:32.520
but my wife loves Jimmy Stewart,

1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:34.120
and she likes me to sleep silky.

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:37.873
Our safe word is Harvey.

1:35:39.250 --> 1:35:42.417
(audience applauding)

1:35:45.645 --> 1:35:46.610
I made a dumb mistake.

1:35:46.610 --> 1:35:48.550
It's a dumb mistake,
it was a dumb mistake.

1:35:48.550 --> 1:35:49.900
So, next times, you liberals,

1:35:49.900 --> 1:35:51.064
one sitting next to you, Trump people go,

1:35:51.064 --> 1:35:52.190
God, I voted for this guy, and man,

1:35:52.190 --> 1:35:53.430
he's just not living up to it.

1:35:53.430 --> 1:35:54.680
I wish I hadn't voted for him.

1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:55.513
Don't get in their face.

1:35:55.513 --> 1:35:57.090
Just go, that's okay, you
peed in your pajama drawer.

1:35:57.090 --> 1:35:58.253
It's all right.

1:36:00.911 --> 1:36:02.120
But here's how we can save America,

1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:05.620
if we can just get rid of the
confidently-stupid people.

1:36:05.620 --> 1:36:06.730
I'm not talking about normal stupid,

1:36:06.730 --> 1:36:07.743
or don't know and are trying,

1:36:07.743 --> 1:36:09.090
I talking about the people that don't know

1:36:09.090 --> 1:36:11.050
and are proud they don't
know, and think they know.

1:36:11.050 --> 1:36:12.340
You know the people I'm talking about?

1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:13.173
People that just yell at you.

1:36:13.173 --> 1:36:14.050
You give 'em a fact, they're like,

1:36:14.050 --> 1:36:15.640
I don't believe that.

1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:18.580
Well, it doesn't care what
you believe, it's a fact.

1:36:18.580 --> 1:36:19.840
Where'd you get that fact?

1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:20.803
NASA.

1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:24.390
NASA, a bunch of nerds,
and geeks, and elites.

1:36:24.390 --> 1:36:25.223
'Cause that's what stupid people do.

1:36:25.223 --> 1:36:26.950
Instead of just taking five minutes

1:36:26.950 --> 1:36:28.560
to look it up, they came up with the words

1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:30.000
to make fun of smart people.

1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:33.436
You know, words like
nerd, and geek, homeowner.

1:36:33.436 --> 1:36:36.436
(audience laughing)

1:36:38.177 --> 1:36:39.760
Elite, the damn elites running it.

1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:41.430
And I was on the elite boat for a minute.

1:36:41.430 --> 1:36:42.760
During the election, I was
like, yeah, the elites!

1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:44.660
Then I looked up what elite means.

1:36:44.660 --> 1:36:45.630
You know what elite means?

1:36:45.630 --> 1:36:47.310
It means best of the best.

1:36:47.310 --> 1:36:50.070
Elite means you're better than
almost anybody at your job.

1:36:50.070 --> 1:36:51.130
If you're elite at what you do,

1:36:51.130 --> 1:36:52.530
you're in the top 5%.

1:36:52.530 --> 1:36:53.930
That's who I want running shit,

1:36:53.930 --> 1:36:56.633
not somebody who owned a beauty pageant.

1:36:56.633 --> 1:36:59.404
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

1:36:59.404 --> 1:37:01.070
Sorry.

1:37:01.070 --> 1:37:03.250
Do you know why?

1:37:03.250 --> 1:37:04.740
'Cause every man on the planet

1:37:04.740 --> 1:37:07.313
when it comes to boobs
and butts is pretty elite,

1:37:08.970 --> 1:37:11.820
but I wouldn't trust one of
you bitches with the economy.

1:37:13.479 --> 1:37:15.290
-  Yeah!

1:37:15.290 --> 1:37:16.970
- I don't like the confidently-stupid.

1:37:16.970 --> 1:37:17.803
And do you know how hard it is

1:37:17.803 --> 1:37:19.397
to be stupid and not know in 2018?

1:37:19.397 --> 1:37:21.700
One time, it was being the smartest mammal

1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:22.533
to walk the planet.

1:37:22.533 --> 1:37:24.810
Every single one of us down
to the dumbest person in here

1:37:24.810 --> 1:37:26.190
has one of these phones,

1:37:26.190 --> 1:37:28.410
and in that phone, clickety-clack,

1:37:28.410 --> 1:37:31.130
is every piece of information

1:37:31.130 --> 1:37:33.250
from the beginning of recorded history,

1:37:33.250 --> 1:37:36.493
and it's four inches from
your butt hole, all day long,

1:37:37.770 --> 1:37:40.063
and you still found time to be a dumbass?

1:37:41.260 --> 1:37:43.450
The gas pumps at the, have a screen

1:37:43.450 --> 1:37:45.440
pumping new information
while you're pumping gas,

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:46.450
and you're still stupid?

1:37:46.450 --> 1:37:47.500
How is that possible?

1:37:50.270 --> 1:37:53.330
Stupid people must just get
home tired every day, you know?

1:37:53.330 --> 1:37:55.250
'Cause it's so hard to be stupid now.

1:37:55.250 --> 1:37:56.640
Your wife goes, what's the matter, hon?

1:37:56.640 --> 1:37:57.780
Oh, babe, I'm so beat.

1:37:57.780 --> 1:37:59.450
Today was rough, I had
to walk to the world

1:37:59.450 --> 1:38:01.490
avoiding truth, and knowledge, and facts.

1:38:01.490 --> 1:38:03.860
Oh, yeah. it was horrible.

1:38:03.860 --> 1:38:05.530
Thank God you put that song on my iPod.

1:38:05.530 --> 1:38:07.760
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:08.593
That was great.

1:38:08.593 --> 1:38:09.950
I just don't wanna think anymore, babe.

1:38:09.950 --> 1:38:11.210
I just wanna turn my brain off.

1:38:11.210 --> 1:38:13.223
Put on Fox News, please, put on Fox.

1:38:14.542 --> 1:38:15.684
Please put on Fox News.

1:38:15.684 --> 1:38:20.480
(audience applauding)
(audience whooping)

1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:22.160
Quick fact for you people that thinkin'

1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:24.530
this lib-tard snowflake,
thinking anything like that.

1:38:24.530 --> 1:38:27.180
Fox News was proven,
after a fact check on 'em

1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:29.163
to be 17% accurate.

1:38:30.810 --> 1:38:32.990
CNN's only 73%, but 17?

1:38:32.990 --> 1:38:34.097
Damn, I did better than that in school

1:38:34.097 --> 1:38:35.931
and I got four Fs and a D.

1:38:35.931 --> 1:38:38.374
(audience applauding)

1:38:38.374 --> 1:38:40.830
(audience whistling)

1:38:40.830 --> 1:38:43.970
Fox News is like the Tofurky of news

1:38:45.610 --> 1:38:47.030
'cause it's not what it says it is,

1:38:47.030 --> 1:38:48.500
but I like Fox for a lot of reasons,

1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:50.660
'cause as a older gentleman, I know

1:38:50.660 --> 1:38:52.198
where to get a comfortable catheter.

1:38:52.198 --> 1:38:55.198
(audience laughing)

1:38:56.300 --> 1:38:58.743
Don't need it yet, I'm
waiting for a coupon.

1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:02.270
Do you guys know the
people I'm talking about,

1:39:02.270 --> 1:39:04.030
the confidently stupid, that are just so,

1:39:04.030 --> 1:39:05.330
like, they don't have any
facts but they're loud about it

1:39:05.330 --> 1:39:07.160
so everyone just backs off?

1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:08.580
Yeah, I know, I know.

1:39:08.580 --> 1:39:12.490
98% of climatologists
say climate change exists

1:39:12.490 --> 1:39:16.197
but 2% say it don't, so
that makes it inconclusive.

1:39:16.197 --> 1:39:19.197
(audience laughing)

1:39:20.606 --> 1:39:21.646
Okay.

1:39:21.646 --> 1:39:25.478
So, if I'm 98% inside your girlfriend

1:39:25.478 --> 1:39:27.741
(audience whooping)

1:39:27.741 --> 1:39:30.908
(audience applauding)

1:39:34.100 --> 1:39:39.100
is she cheating on you
or is it inconclusive?

1:39:40.890 --> 1:39:43.853
Either way, I believe
you've been disenfranchised.

1:39:43.853 --> 1:39:45.783
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

1:39:45.783 --> 1:39:47.883
Thank you very much.

1:39:47.883 --> 1:39:49.443
Thank you, very much.

1:39:49.443 --> 1:39:50.663
Fix this bitch!

1:39:50.663 --> 1:39:51.973
Fix this bitch!

1:39:51.973 --> 1:39:53.234
-  Fix this bitch!

1:39:53.234 --> 1:39:54.535
Fix this bitch!

1:39:54.535 --> 1:39:55.863
Fix this bitch!

1:39:55.863 --> 1:39:57.103
Fix this bitch!

1:39:57.103 --> 1:39:58.791
- Goodnight, everybody,
thank you very much!

1:39:58.791 --> 1:40:03.791
(rock version of "The
Star-Spangled Banner")

1:40:05.469 --> 1:40:06.871
See you guys again!

1:40:06.871 --> 1:40:08.119
Thank you, so much!

1:40:08.119 --> 1:40:08.952
Goodnight.

1:40:15.775 --> 1:40:16.608
Bye, guys.
