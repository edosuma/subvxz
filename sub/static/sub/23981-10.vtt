WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.802
Listen, I...

00:11.761 --> 00:15.223
What I'm saying is if you deliver it
and it goes on my door...

00:16.016 --> 00:18.018
and someone steals it, that's your fault.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.271
So, I have to spend a hundred bucks

00:21.354 --> 00:25.358
so I can get another fucking beard trimmer
I already paid for once? Great.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.818
Good business, guys. Thanks.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.154
-Barely.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.864
I moved into
this sketchy neighborhood,

00:30.947 --> 00:32.073
and someone's stealing my mail.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.074
Hmm.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.744
I think it's the landlady's kid,
'cause he's a shifty little fuck.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.996
I didn't know you moved.

00:38.079 --> 00:44.294
Since the split, Arya stays in one place
and then Denise and I rotate in and out.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.880
It's gotta have fringe benefits, right?

00:46.963 --> 00:49.007
You got your own place,
your little babe lair.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.761
Please, I wish. I haven't gotten laid
since the divorce.

00:52.844 --> 00:53.845
Oh, shit. Really?

00:54.262 --> 00:56.222
Story of my life, dude. I used to kill it.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.767
I thought I'd be the shark in the ocean
on a feeding frenzy,

00:58.850 --> 01:04.606
but it turns out I'm just a sad, little,
dickless eel that gets no pussy.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.276
Too bad,
I'd like for that eel to get some.

01:08.359 --> 01:11.905
Yeah. Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about that shoot.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.283
Shoot went great.
I mean, Arya was awesome.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.410
Well, she can't be in it.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.330
What? No, I mean, she is in it.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.207
We shot her stuff already. So...

01:22.290 --> 01:25.293
Well, it's non

01:26.002 --> 01:28.421
Plus, if it turns out to be a big turd,

01:28.505 --> 01:30.632
people are gonna see it,
and that'll hurt her career.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.010
Yeah, but it's so not a turd,
it's really--

01:34.093 --> 01:37.514
It's also weird you didn't ask us
if she could be in it.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.849
Do you think that's weird?
She's a kid.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.684
You don't negotiate with a teenager

01:41.768 --> 01:44.270
and just get her
in your thing on the side.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.814
I was just trying to be proactive.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.607
I figured that's what the big shots do.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.111
They just go and ask and then beg
for forgiveness later, but--

01:51.194 --> 01:54.405
Listen, I don't want to be that guy
and stress you out,

01:54.489 --> 01:55.907
but she can't be in it.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.450
And if she's in it, we're gonna sue you

01:57.534 --> 02:00.203
and go through all that
and nobody wants that.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.997
Then don't be that guy,
be the guy who says,

02:03.081 --> 02:05.750
"This is awesome, and I'm supporting you,
Gus."

02:05.834 --> 02:08.378
Fruit by the Foot. Are you kidding me?

02:09.045 --> 02:12.048
Oh, my God, what a little nugget I found.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.384
<i>Haley, I know you're scared. We all are.</i>

02:14.467 --> 02:17.262
<i>You have to tell me what you saw</i>
<i>before someone else gets killed.</i>

02:17.345 --> 02:20.098
<i>They threatened my family.</i>
<i>What if I'm next?</i>

02:23.059 --> 02:25.395
All right. So...

02:26.271 --> 02:30.066
With Arya out... Uh...
What do we got to work with?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.611
-Nothing.
-Well, don't say nothing.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.196
Let's stay positive here.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.448
She witnesses the murder,
so without her scene,

02:37.532 --> 02:38.867
-the ending makes no sense.
-Yeah.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.327
-Hold on.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.706
Fuck.

02:44.789 --> 02:48.668
Okay, uh, Mickey's here,
so we gotta wrap this up.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.212
What are

02:51.754 --> 02:55.550
What might be cool is we could take
what we have and turn it into a trailer.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.219
You realize this was supposed
to be a seven-part mini-series,

02:58.303 --> 02:59.470
not a two

02:59.554 --> 03:01.598
This could be for the best.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.308
Show people the good parts.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.936
What do you mean "the good parts"?
You're saying there's bad parts?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.981
-I mean, you know, the script is great.
Mm-hmm.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.318
You did a really great job,
but execution-wise,

03:13.401 --> 03:14.777
-Okay, no.
-I don't thin we--

03:14.903 --> 03:17.447
You need to stop talking,
or I'm gonna burst into tears.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.823
-Yeah.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.242
Okay. Um...

03:22.702 --> 03:25.788
-Let's do the trailer.
-I think that's gonna be good.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.667
Pretty soon, this passion project
is gonna be a 30-second commercial.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.295
I mean,
that's not such a bad idea, either.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.301
-Hey. Sorry.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.510
I was just having a talk.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.554
Movie magic

03:41.638 --> 03:45.350
Uh... It's great.
It's going really great.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.269
What's going on?
I sense some tension in here.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.940
No, there's no tension.
We're just talking about the movie.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.776
-So, I'll see you guys later.
-Okay.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.486
-Bye!
-Bye.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.029
-Have fun in South Dakota.
-Yeah.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.949
-Fucking--

04:01.032 --> 04:02.367
-Yeah.
-Yep, okay.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.501
What do you think? I'd say we got about
five good minutes, tops.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.461
Oh! I was thinking three.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.630
Maybe we can squeeze
three and a half out of this thing.

04:39.862 --> 04:43.366
You seem kind of anx-y.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.869
Yeah, it's my cute way of saying anxious
so you don't think I'm being judgy.

04:46.953 --> 04:47.954
-Oh!
-Mm-hmm.

04:48.037 --> 04:51.165
-Okay. Well, I'm feeling very anx-y, then.
-Mm-hmm.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.001
No, I don't know. I'm just...

04:53.084 --> 04:56.963
You know, it's stressful going back,
seeing the family.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.092
I mean, I love 'em. They're great.
They're the best.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.221
-But...
-But...

05:05.305 --> 05:08.224
They just can be
a bit much sometimes.

05:08.308 --> 05:13.688
I mean, as a heads up,
my dad's gonna seem maybe angry

05:13.771 --> 05:17.692
or mean, but he's just quiet and reserved.

05:17.775 --> 05:21.571
And my mom,
she can get a little loud sometimes,

05:21.654 --> 05:25.116
especially after a few drinks.
But, you know, fun loud.

05:25.658 --> 05:30.330
I don't know. They're great. I love them.
Seriously, they're the best.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.207
That is the nicest shit talking
I've ever heard.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.252
Relax, it's gonna be fine.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.424
I know, I know, I know.
Honestly, I just want you to like them.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.717
Okay.

05:44.635 --> 05:48.389
I mean, they are a bit conservative,
so I don't want to be like,

05:48.473 --> 05:51.100
-"Tone it down, Mickey," but--
-No, I get it.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.228
I will not bring up abortion...
until after dinner.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.105
-Okay, thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.781
-Mm-hmm.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.866
Can you tell me if my house has a smell?

06:06.949 --> 06:08.785
Everybody's house has a smell.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.787
No, no, I know. I just...

06:10.870 --> 06:13.581
Because I grew up with it,
I don't know what it is.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.792
-Okay.
-And I can't identify it.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.669
-It's like one of those things.
-I'll take a big whiff.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.631
Okay. So, I, uh...

06:22.715 --> 06:24.717
-I think my parents must be asleep.
-Okay.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.763
-So, we can just turn in now.
-Sure.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.433
-Oh.

06:33.935 --> 06:40.483
It smells like laundry detergent,
ham and Shalimar.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.026
-She did, good nose.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.904
Is that you?
Ah!

06:44.987 --> 06:47.907
-Oh, my gosh. Hi, Mom.
-Yay! My sweetie!

06:48.616 --> 06:49.617
Hello.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.912
-You look wonderful.
-Oh, thank you, thank you.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.664
-Dad. Hey.
-Hey, buddy.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.917
Good to see you. Mom, Dad, this is Mickey.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.544
-Nice to meet you.
-Mickey!

06:59.627 --> 07:01.963
There we are.
-Mickey, I'm Vicki. Oh.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.673
Look at us. Mickey and Vicki.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.051
-We should be a singing duo.
-Oh, we could do that! Yes!

07:07.135 --> 07:09.887
-It was good. Good drive, I would say.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.848
-Mm-hmm.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.142
Took 212 to 14 West.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.602
-Oh, that's good. That's smart.
-Yeah, yeah.

07:16.686 --> 07:20.273
You two must be starving, huh?
I'll warm up some cheese potatoes.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.316
-Yeah, yeah.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.361
South Dakota put
their two favorite foods together.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.780
My cholesterol is about 500,
but I don't care anymore.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.282
-Oh.
-Hmm.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.869
Mmm. Mmm.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.163
-This is delicious.
-Mm-hmm.
-Everybody loves Mom's cheese potatoes.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.501
-She's the best cook.
-Good to see you eating, Gus.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.212
This guy was so skinny, I was afraid
he'd fall through his own asshole.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.465
-Hon...

07:46.299 --> 07:47.717
Oh, my gosh.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.762
Uh, so, Mickey,
Gus tells us you're in radio.

07:51.846 --> 07:55.349
Oh, yeah. She's a big-time producer.
She is killing it.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.769
Oh, well, that's very impressive.
-Thank you.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.606
So, how about you, sweetie?
How's your job?

08:01.689 --> 08:03.441
It's good. <i>Witchita</i> is going great.

08:03.524 --> 08:08.070
And I just finished my movie,
which is very exciting.

08:08.154 --> 08:12.533
I hope you put our money to good use.
Mom tells me that Arya's in it, too?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.952
Oh, Arya? Yeah, she's in it.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.038
Honey. Honey, where did we see her?

08:17.121 --> 08:22.043
What was that movie with, you know,
the cop from that show?

08:22.126 --> 08:23.377
Come on. Help me out here.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.087
Which cop show guy

08:25.171 --> 08:27.465
No. The one where they're
always investigating everything.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.510
You know, that one on Channel 4.
The one that Beverly hates.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.053
The sex crimes one?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.639
Oh, no, she loves the sex crimes one.
Ooh!

08:34.722 --> 08:37.934
-Oh, gosh. This is gonna bug me.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.228
Does Arya have another job lined up?

08:40.311 --> 08:42.313
You better have another job lined up, too.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.899
You never quit a job
unless you have a job.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.651
-Totally right.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.653
If you're still hungry,
I have some more food.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.572
We could sit over here.
We could be comfortable.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.990
Yeah.
Mmm!

08:53.074 --> 08:57.078
Wow! Now what are these?
-Well, these are my boy's favorite.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.080
-As I recall.
Yes.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.498
These are called pickle wheels.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.333
-Yum, yum, yum.
-Oh, yeah.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.753
So it's pickles and cream cheese
and you wrap it in meat.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.255
-Wow.
Mm-hmm.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.216
How have I gone my whole life
without having a pickle wheel?

09:10.299 --> 09:13.719
-It's another South Dakota delicacy.
Yummy, huh?

09:13.803 --> 09:17.473
-Uh, I think we're good. Thanks, though.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.476
-Mom, we're fine.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.562
Well, let her answer, ding-dong.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.731
You know what?
I'm fine, I'm actually sober.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.277
Oh. Okay. Neat. How long?

09:29.360 --> 09:31.696
Oh. That's not
a really polite thing to ask.

09:31.779 --> 09:32.697
Oh, it's okay.

09:32.780 --> 09:38.119
Oh, okay. When was it? I guess it was
sometime before we met, right?

09:39.036 --> 09:40.371
-No.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.290
I wasn't sober when we met.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.668
Oh. Uh... Basically, it was around there,
though, right?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.128
-Sure.
-Yeah.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.255
-Well, you don't mind if I...
-No. Go right ahead.

09:49.338 --> 09:53.092
-Okay, all righty. More for me.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.846
Here we are gabbing about our jobs.
How's work for you two?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.472
Yeah, must be tough being a principal.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.807
Gets tougher every year.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.518
-Last week a kid called me a fascist.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.937
Yeah.
But he has his hobbies and that helps.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.522
You know, fishing and hunting.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.358
-Oh, Dad.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.194
It's midnight. She doesn't want
to be looking at guns.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.404
Show me those guns!

10:15.781 --> 10:20.036
-This is a bolt action. Here. Hold that.
-Okay. All right.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.164
Put it up against your shoulder...
Yeah. Like that.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.291
-Unh-unh.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.751
Could have fooled me. You're a natural.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.379
Oh, yeah. He's right. You look so poised.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.797
Does that feel weird, Mickey?

10:31.881 --> 10:36.469
No, I like it. I get it, I 100%
understand the appeal of this thing.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.888
I guess I didn't take you as a hunter.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.515
Oh, I eat steaks. So that's killing a cow.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.727
I wouldn't shoot a white tiger,
but there's a lot of birds I don't like.

10:45.394 --> 10:49.899
Come up in October. Shoot some pheasant.
Me and Ken go every year. Shotgun.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.276
Ooh, yeah. Pheasants suck.
Tell Ken I'm in.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.903
Oh, you can tell him yourself.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.988
Him and his family are dropping by

10:56.072 --> 10:57.615
-early in the morning.
-Ah.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.743
Oh, and Caroline and Andrew are coming
the night before the party.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.161
-Yeah!

11:02.244 --> 11:04.205
Oh, my God, I can't wait for that party.

11:07.208 --> 11:11.087
It flew by. Just flew by.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.422
Yeah, for me it felt
exactly like 40 years.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.385
How long have you two known each other?

11:17.468 --> 11:20.930
Oh, what's it been, Mickey

11:21.013 --> 11:24.517
Well, in 39 years, you're gonna know
what I'm talking about.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.979
-Yes, they are.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.607
Oh, my God. Just lovely.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.403
-Ooh, I like being in here.

11:35.486 --> 11:40.950
It's like traveling back in time to see
how little teenage Gussie lived.

11:41.033 --> 11:45.579
Oh, yeah. If these walls could talk,
they'd say...

11:45.663 --> 11:48.582
"This boy loves jacking it."

11:51.752 --> 11:55.673
You know, I really like your parents.
A lot.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.049
Oh.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.051
That's nice to hear. I could tell they...

11:59.635 --> 12:01.387
I could tell they really liked you, too.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.431
I can see it in their eyes.
It was very sweet.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.433
Yeah, I don't know why you're so worried.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.519
Your dad's not scary. He's sweet.
So's your mom.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.271
Yes, that's true.

12:10.354 --> 12:15.818
It's just, you know, they're sort of
naturally repressed people.

12:15.901 --> 12:19.071
They were in
good first impression mode too, so...

12:19.155 --> 12:21.157
But whatever, I mean, believe me, the fact that you like them
and they like you

12:23.868 --> 12:26.287
makes me very happy.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.080
I mean, you liked my dad.

12:28.164 --> 12:32.543
Yeah, but I got how he wasn't always
the best dude to you and stuff. Yeah.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.003
But you gotta learn to forgive.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.297
Resentment is like holding
onto a hot coal.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.716
Eventually,
you're the one who gets burned.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.092
Hmm.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.678
Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.764
Another one is,
"Resentment is like drinking poison

12:45.848 --> 12:48.142
-and hoping the other person dies."
-Huh.

12:48.225 --> 12:52.480
Yeah, and "the only difference between
a flower and a weed is judgment."

12:52.980 --> 12:55.483
-I like that weed-flower one.
-I finish strong.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.443
Yeah, that one was really good.

12:57.526 --> 13:01.155
It's just... my brother Ken
is going to be the tough one.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.240
He's Mr. Expert. He'll tell you

13:03.324 --> 13:04.950
-everything you're doing wrong--
-Hey.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.622
Oh. Um...

13:09.705 --> 13:10.873
Yeah, okay.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.541
Have you ever had sex in this bed?

13:13.626 --> 13:17.505
No. Should I go get a bottle of champagne
to crash on the headboard?

13:25.846 --> 13:27.097
Hey, um...

13:27.181 --> 13:29.183
-I'm just a little worried about my...

13:29.266 --> 13:33.145
...family waking up, so can you
make the moans sound like snoring?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.314
-I'm getting in my head now.
-I'm sorry.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.024
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay. -Make whatever sound you want.
-Okay.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.032
Wake up!

13:45.115 --> 13:46.867
-Oh!

13:46.951 --> 13:48.827
Hi, sweetie!

13:48.911 --> 13:51.080
-Finally!
-Hey.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.039
He has risen.

13:52.122 --> 13:55.960
Ah, come here. Good morning.
Good morning, Ken. Kelly, hi.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.087
-Hi.
-Kelly, Ken, this is Mickey.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.838
Hi. Hi.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
Sorry if Nina woke you guys.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.593
Ah, no, it's fine.
We had to get up anyway, so...

14:04.677 --> 14:06.136
I must be wired differently than you.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.681
I cannot sleep in like that.
I'm up at 5:30 every day.

14:08.764 --> 14:11.350
-Thank you. Good morning.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.434
Good morning.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.604
Now, you must not get much sleep
at all though with this guy.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.357
-Shut up.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.526
Oh. Yeah, I mean,
I've heard him once or twice.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.819
I thought it was cute.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.488
Remember when I had you come in
and he was talking in his sleep?

14:24.572 --> 14:29.159
And he was walking around going,
"The campfire goes here!"

14:29.243 --> 14:31.662
Sweet. Aww.
-That.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.956
It was funny.
He was dreaming about camping.

14:34.039 --> 14:38.085
Maybe I was dreaming about
building a warm fire for my loved ones.

14:38.168 --> 14:41.338
-I don't know.
-Oh, yeah. It was probably that, Ken.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.299
-We don't need to...
-All right.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.134
Okay, he loves you.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.345
Of course I do, I'm teasing him.
I'm glad you're here.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.222
-That's nice.
-Thank you. Thank you.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.432
That's very sweet.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.767
What have we got planned?
What are gonna do today, guys?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.853
We can't sit inside all day.
Who's up for some Cornhole?

14:55.936 --> 15:00.399
Is that a game?
-Oh, is it.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.693
Should we team up and make this real?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.445
-Yeah.
-All right, Dad, you go with Kelly.

15:04.528 --> 15:08.407
And then Mom, Gus.
And then you want to double up?

15:08.490 --> 15:11.201
Yeah, let's do it.
-Mickey and me could be a team, too.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.121
Well, no,
I was trying to make it more fair.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.457
So it's people that are good at it
with people

15:16.540 --> 15:18.667
-that are less experienced or whatever.
-Yeah.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.586
Mom would be the experienced one,

15:20.669 --> 15:22.546
-then you're-- whatever, the rest.
-Okay.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.507
I'll help you out.
Gotcha. All right, yeah.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.968

16:02.920 --> 16:04.588
-That is how you Cornhole!
Oh, yes!

16:04.672 --> 16:06.715
-Team Ken and Mick! You're good!
-Yeah.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.009
We'll get 'em next time.
-Yeah. It's okay.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.220
I'm not that competitive,
I don't even care, so...

16:11.303 --> 16:13.764
That's fine, yeah. Good game, everybody!

16:13.847 --> 16:15.099
All right, losers pick up.

-Fuck!

17:50.861 --> 17:53.072
-The drain's all blocked up.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.531
I thought you were out for the day.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.033
Yeah, it got super hot.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.911
Has this ever happened before?
You should ask Mickey.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.915
No. No one likes getting a panicky call
when they're out of town. I'll fix it.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.458
You can really fix this?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.335
I don't know. Can you?

18:06.794 --> 18:09.046
-No way. We should call a plumber.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.969
Are you mad at me?

18:16.470 --> 18:20.057
I'm just...
It just sucks dealing with this.

18:20.474 --> 18:24.561
Yeah, but like, outside of this,
you've been acting really weird around me.

18:24.645 --> 18:28.565
You always seem kind of cranky,
and we haven't had sex in, like--

18:28.649 --> 18:31.110
Can we talk about this
when I'm not covered in bile?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.321
-Fuck!

18:35.155 --> 18:36.073
What?

18:36.156 --> 18:39.785
Oh, it's just like...
It sucks dealing with this, fuck.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.668
-Hi, come on in.
-Hey.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.336
Hi. Randy's here.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.048
-Hey!
-Oh. Hey, Chris.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.342
-Hey. Uh...

18:55.425 --> 18:59.930
Oh, I told Chris about the blocked drain.
He said he'd come over and take a look.

19:00.013 --> 19:03.684
-Yep.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.978
Well, you could've asked me, Bertie.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.813
Yeah, but you know,
you were out for the day,

19:07.896 --> 19:10.440
and you did just literally say
you couldn't fix it.

19:10.524 --> 19:15.154
Yeah, well, not everybody has
a drain gun thing.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.865
-But...
-Uh, it's a drain snake.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.117
Yeah, well, I would've figured it out.

19:20.784 --> 19:24.580
Um... You know, I can go and...
You can borrow this, if you want.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.873
It is pretty easy.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.292
This thing just comes out
and then it will grab the hair...

19:28.375 --> 19:31.879
No, no, no. Stay.
Uh, we can fix it together.

19:31.962 --> 19:37.134
-We'll use the, uh, the snake. Cool.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.224
So, Mickey, what'd you think?
Thank you, Father. Did you like it?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.018
Don't grill her about this stuff.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.102
Thank you, Father.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.189
-I thought it was nice, very peaceful.
-I saw you took communion.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.940
Was that bad? Gus told me I shouldn't.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.861
No, it's just, you know,
Catholics think that the bread and wine

19:55.944 --> 19:59.156
is Jesus' actual body and blood.
So I just wanted you to be aware.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.618
That's why I want to try it. It's like
Anthony Bourdain eating a cow's brain.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.036
I liked that you tried it.

20:04.119 --> 20:07.289
Me, too. It's good to try everything once.

20:07.372 --> 20:11.585
Oh, and what about Father Tom?
Isn't his sermon good? He's so smart.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.046
You think he's cute.
Your mother has a crush on our priest.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.257
-I don't. Stop saying that.
-You said he was handsome.

20:17.341 --> 20:21.303
Just 'cause you asked me.
I mean, he's okay. He's no Jimmy Smits.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.513
So, Gus,
you get to church much in LA or...

20:23.597 --> 20:26.099
Oh, yeah. No, I try to.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.727
Dude, come on. Do you even believe in God?

20:28.810 --> 20:32.397
All right, all right. Let's not have
the Spanish Inquisition.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.441
Okay, yeah.

20:34.524 --> 20:37.152
I want to show Mickey a few spots
around town

20:37.236 --> 20:38.987
so I'm gonna give her a quick tour
and we'll be back.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.197
All right.
-Bye.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.657
Bye.
See you.

20:42.449 --> 20:46.286
-I've never seen you go to church.
-Yeah. I was lying.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.913
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.999
-All right, all fixed.
-Beautiful, thank you.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.585
-Yeah.
-Uh, yeah. Thanks, Chris.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.096
Well, I think I'm gonna take off.

21:04.179 --> 21:07.349
All right, cool, yeah.
I'm gonna shower now that it's fixed.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.059
-Cool.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.436
-All right, have a good day, bud.
-Yeah. See you, dude.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.646
All right, see you.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.857
Hey, does he know about us?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.235
-It seemed like he was jealous.
-Oh, no.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.405
I think he's jealous of how quickly
you fixed the drain.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.990
Which was amazing, by the way.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.075
The way you were like...

21:25.158 --> 21:27.661
-It was incredible.
-Thanks.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.038
I just...

21:31.123 --> 21:35.127
I don't think we should be hooking up
while you guys are still together.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.630
Okay, but... what are you saying?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.842
Well, if you break up with him,
then it wouldn't feel so wrong.

21:42.467 --> 21:47.347
I want to break up with him.
It's just really, really hard.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.309
But I like you so much.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.518
I know. Me, too.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.730
Uh...

21:55.647 --> 21:56.815
Okay.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.155
-I'm gonna go try and return this.
-Oh, okay.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.574
-See you.
-Bye.

22:06.616 --> 22:10.412
Over there is where my first job was.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.913
-Aw!
-Yeah.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.624
Hey, uh, Mickey, thank you so much,
by the way,

22:14.708 --> 22:17.336
for pretending to like church
for my family.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.380
-It meant a lot to them and me...
-No. I genuinely liked it.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.299
-Oh!
You didn't?

22:22.382 --> 22:25.427
-No, I did not.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.264
I think your family could handle it.
You should give 'em more credit.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.561
I know you're all
buddy-buddy, best friends

22:34.644 --> 22:37.022
with the Cruikshanks now, so sorry to...

22:37.105 --> 22:38.315
What does this mean?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.317
What? I don't know,

22:40.400 --> 22:45.989
it's just like you're super into church
and guns and Cornhole.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.242
I'm like, "Who is this person?"
I'm surprised. That's all.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.453
You're weirded out that
I'm getting along with your family?

22:51.536 --> 22:54.206
Because before we got here,
you're so concerned

22:54.289 --> 22:55.457
that we weren't gonna get along.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.168
And now that we are,
you're pissed about it?

22:59.669 --> 23:01.505
I admit, it does not make sense.

23:02.172 --> 23:05.092
I'm being weird here. It's fine.
You're right.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.849
You know, right there is where I smoked
my first cigarette with my friends.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.521
And then, right there

23:17.604 --> 23:21.358
is where I immediately threw up chili
in front of my friends.

23:22.651 --> 23:26.196
Look, I get it. You've got
your own history with your family,

23:26.279 --> 23:30.367
but try to see them through my eyes
and you'll see how great they are.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.411
Yeah. You're right, you're right.

23:33.495 --> 23:38.375
And when we get back to the house,
just relax and try to enjoy 'em like I do.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.627
You're very smart. Thank you.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.548
-You're the smartest person I know.
-I know.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.342
I mean, your friends are all idiots.
Ruby can barely speak.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.302
<i>-Give me the Super Soaker.</i>
<i>-No, it's mine.</i>

23:49.386 --> 23:51.805
<i>-No, Dad bought it for me.</i>
<i>-He bought it for both of us.</i>

23:51.888 --> 23:52.764
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

23:52.848 --> 23:55.142
Oh, my God! Look at you!
Oh, my God.

23:55.225 --> 23:58.728
Why does this make me laugh so much?
This part right here...

24:02.858 --> 24:06.403
I'm just glad this is a video before
I hit puberty and all hell broke loose.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.530
Otherwise, you would have seen...

24:08.613 --> 24:11.491
one big zit and a tiny little boner.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.119
-I'm glad we have evidence of this. We can show it in court
for what a jerk you used to be.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.874
I wasn't a jerk.
I called "no take backs."

24:18.957 --> 24:21.585
You'd had your turn with it, Gus.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.546
Hello, Cruikshanks.
Roll out the red carpet!

24:24.629 --> 24:27.883
Oh, my God. Lina

24:27.966 --> 24:29.384
Good. Hi.

24:29.467 --> 24:32.345
-Hi, hi. Hello. Hi, Dad.
-Hello, my little girl.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.598
Hello, good to see you.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.892
Hello. Hi, good to see you.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.435
Oh, we missed you.

24:38.518 --> 24:41.771
-Okay. Yeah, right.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.690
Caroline, this is Mickey.
Mickey, Caroline.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.775
Hi! I've heard so many great things
about you.

24:45.859 --> 24:49.196
Oh, good. So everybody's been getting
the payoff money, then?

24:49.279 --> 24:50.322
-Took care of it.

24:50.405 --> 24:54.534
Oh, I see we pulled out a family classic
for our new guest.

24:54.618 --> 24:58.413
But I was just thinking,
since you're both here in the flesh,

24:58.496 --> 25:00.916
maybe we could, you know,
get a little bit of...

25:01.791 --> 25:03.501
-Nope! No.
Oh, my... Come on.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.463
Wait a second. What is this?

25:06.546 --> 25:11.259
Ever since they were little kids,
they put on a show. It's a great show.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.387
Okay, it was cute,
and now it's just weird. So...

25:14.471 --> 25:16.139
Grotesque is what it is.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.100
Grotesque? I love grotesque. Come on, Gus.

25:19.184 --> 25:23.104
Come on. Come on.
Come on, please. Come on.

25:23.480 --> 25:27.108
-Okay.
Gus, you caved!

25:27.192 --> 25:29.569
-I got the outfits, let me get 'em.
-Gus, I will help. He's Gus! He caved!

25:32.113 --> 25:34.741
-<i>♪ I'm so excited ♪</i>

25:34.824 --> 25:36.701

25:38.161 --> 25:41.373

25:41.456 --> 25:43.166
I think we're seeing a dress rehearsal.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.420

25:52.926 --> 25:54.636
Whoo!

25:57.180 --> 25:58.807
-Bravo!
Thank you.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.309
-When they were little, it was so cute.
It was like synchronized swimming.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.979
It was still sad, but it was like...
cute sad Gus.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.148
You all just watched us perform a song
about the joy of the female orgasm.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.360
-So... congrats.

26:10.443 --> 26:13.655
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.365
I gotta go saw some logs.

26:15.448 --> 26:17.367
-Good night, everybody.
-Yeah, I'm exhausted.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.160
I'll grab Nina,
make sure she doesn't wake.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.204
Actually, everybody, before you go,

26:21.288 --> 26:24.249
we have a little bit of news
that we wanted to announce,

26:24.332 --> 26:26.418
and I was gonna wait
for Andrew to get here,

26:26.501 --> 26:28.420
but I don't want to...

26:28.503 --> 26:32.090
-like, overshadow the party tomorrow, so--
-Just say it.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.510
-We're having a baby boy.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.598
That's great!

26:40.682 --> 26:42.976
That's awesome. Congratulations.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.228
A grandson, how about that?

26:45.312 --> 26:47.188
Thank you.
-You're gonna be busy!

26:47.272 --> 26:49.274
Gus, they're lapping us.

26:49.357 --> 26:53.737
I know. It's like pump the brakes, guys.
You're making us look bad.

26:53.820 --> 26:57.991
Well, it doesn't have to be that way.
How about catching up a little?

26:58.074 --> 27:00.327
Maybe we could expect
some grandchildren, Gussie?

27:00.410 --> 27:01.828
Oh...

27:01.911 --> 27:04.831
No, don't hold your breath.

27:04.914 --> 27:05.957
What does that mean?

27:06.041 --> 27:08.877
What? No, I just mean, like,

27:09.961 --> 27:13.965
I don't even think we could handle that.
That's crazy. So crazy.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.425
Why would you say that?

27:15.508 --> 27:18.720
I mean, maybe in four years or something.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.306
Gus, you just stepped in it, bro.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.643
Stepped in it,
I don't think I might have...

27:25.727 --> 27:28.188
-Yeah, I feel good.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.773
Good, you look really good.

27:34.069 --> 27:38.531
So, um, I'm setting my alarm for nine.
What time are you gonna get up?

27:43.453 --> 27:46.289
Is it, like, you're not talking to me,
or...

27:46.873 --> 27:48.208
"Don't hold your breath"?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.169
For what?

27:51.252 --> 27:53.671
No, that's what you said
to your mom and your dad.

27:53.755 --> 27:57.092
"Don't hold your breath"? That is so rude!

27:57.175 --> 28:00.678
-Well, it was a joke.
-It was a mean and shitty joke.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.641
Okay, maybe it was a bad joke,
but I didn't mean it, so...

28:04.724 --> 28:08.186
-You said I shouldn't have children.
-In four years.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.939
I said that because
I knew you would get upset.

28:11.022 --> 28:14.609
-So I was like, "Well, in four years."
What does that mean?

28:15.026 --> 28:16.111
In four years...

28:17.237 --> 28:19.572
we figure out
if we're having a kid or not. I just--

28:19.656 --> 28:22.659
What

28:22.742 --> 28:27.330
Why four years in this master plan
that you've concocted for my life?

28:27.414 --> 28:30.208
You're making it sound like
way worse than what it actually is.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.877
I just mean, like, in four years
we'll have a better...

28:34.129 --> 28:36.840
-understanding of...

28:37.590 --> 28:40.009
Just say it. Will you just say it?

28:40.093 --> 28:41.428
Your sobriety.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.642
We'll know if you're sober or not.
I don't know.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.987
So you don't think
I'm gonna be sober in four years.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.197
And you don't want
to have children with me.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.867
I didn't say that.

29:03.950 --> 29:08.246
You told me that last week
you almost drank, okay?

29:08.747 --> 29:11.207
So when I hear that,
it makes me scared about, like...

29:11.291 --> 29:12.917
"
-I get it.

29:13.001 --> 29:16.379
"Is she gonna drink in a week,
two weeks or a year? I don't know."

29:16.463 --> 29:17.881
How do you think sobriety works?

29:17.964 --> 29:21.134
You think in four years
I couldn't fall off the wagon?

29:21.217 --> 29:23.386
You think in ten years
I couldn't fall off the wagon?

29:23.470 --> 29:25.722
You think in 20 years
I couldn't fall off the wagon?

29:25.805 --> 29:26.973
There are no guarantees.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.058
All I can promise you is right now

29:29.142 --> 29:31.060
-I am trying as hard as I fucking can.
-Okay.

29:31.144 --> 29:35.106
So it doesn't make me feel very good
that now you're backing away.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.233
You can no longer see a future with me

29:37.317 --> 29:40.779
because I told you
I almost but didn't drink last week.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.573
-Mm-hmm.
-That was a really shitty moment for me.

29:43.656 --> 29:44.949
But you know what?

29:45.033 --> 29:48.661
I felt proud of myself after that,
'cause I didn't drink.

29:48.745 --> 29:52.874
And if you can't see that as a victory,
and now you're just nervous and scared,

29:52.957 --> 29:55.627
"Oh, God, she's not the right person
to have a kid with,"

29:55.710 --> 29:57.587
then what are we doing?
I can't look at you.

29:57.670 --> 30:00.131
You are being such a dick right now.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.676
You ask me to be honest all the time
and then when I'm honest--

30:03.760 --> 30:05.094
If that's really how you feel...

30:06.930 --> 30:08.932
then maybe we shouldn't be together.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.812
What? Come on. I didn't...

30:14.312 --> 30:15.814
You know, that's not what I--

30:15.897 --> 30:18.233
Maybe we just shouldn't be
in a relationship then.

30:27.867 --> 30:31.246
You're really gonna do this right now
while we're back at my parents' house?

30:31.329 --> 30:33.373
You're gonna fucking
start talking about breaking up?

30:33.456 --> 30:35.041
You brought it up with your shitty joke.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.794
I didn't bring up breaking up.
You brought that up.

30:37.877 --> 30:41.130
No. But how you really feel about me
is grounds for breaking up.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.425
Okay, come on. Let's just--
We're getting upset.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.136
I think there's a lot of pressure
with families and stuff.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.889
-No, I'm not relaxing.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.725
Get out! I don't want to sleep
in the same bed as you.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.233
I'll fucking scream if you don't get out.

31:06.197 --> 31:09.367
Randy, I think we should break up.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.599
-Fuck!

31:34.225 --> 31:36.644
I didn't know you were here.
I'm sorry, man.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.731
-Yeah, I got in, like, 30 minutes ago.
-Jesus.

31:39.814 --> 31:40.899
Did you just fart?

31:42.066 --> 31:44.569
-Yeah, you startled me. I just farted.
-Ugh.

31:44.652 --> 31:47.739
-I'm sorry. Good to see you. I'm just...
-See you.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.158
You don't have to do that.
It's not that bad.
