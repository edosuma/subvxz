>> It is if it's my trash can.
I knew you'd been stuffing your

It took me a week, but i caught
you red-handed.

You've been hiding there for a
week?

12:30.350 --> 12:34.119
>> What i do with my retirement
is my own business.
Now, leave this trash can alone.

You don't own the air inside it.

>> Yes, i do.
>> Dad: You can't own nothing.
>> But i own the lid to nothing,

>> Dad: Oh.

going to intimidate me?

I'll be...
>> Sent to prison.
And it was all...

>> Gumball: Dad, could you
explain that again, this time

I see what's happening here.

13:22.736 --> 13:26.905
>> Dad: Boys, i need you to
sneak into Mr. Robinson's house.
There's this old prank i used to

do in college.
>> Gumball: College?
>> Dad: Okay, high school.

safe.
>> Gumball: Okay, let's do this.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.126
Right.
Now we just need to find the
butter.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.129

and canned stuff?
I mean, look.

get on with it.

think we're doing the right
thing.

disobey Mr. dad.
He told us to put butter on

Let's compromise.

maybe we shouldn't have chosen
the floor.

We've reduced a beautiful

>> Gumball: We have to make up
for this.

Let's tell Mr. Robinson we'll
help him settle the score with

cried so much, all the
moisture's gone from my body.

No!

>> Dad: Robinson stole all my

in that magic bath, but how did

he trick the tag?
Okay, boys, here's the plan.

it.

is the key...

there.

If you'd have shared that cake,

that trash can, we wouldn't have

should have figured it out by

now?
>> Gumball: I'll go and check.
Oh, man.

idea you've ever had!
>> Gumball: Oh, come on.

It was pretty good --
the mysterious riddle, the
positive message, the fact they

one.

to get them back in the house
before the cops come.

>> Darwin: Ahh!
>> I agree.
Wearing a tie every day despite

21:42.735 --> 21:47.905
neither of us having a job is
perfectly appropriate.

nothing to do.
>> You know, watterson, maybe

21:51.611 --> 21:54.945

after all.
