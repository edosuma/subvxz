<i>Previously on</i>
<i>when calls the heart...</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:06.405
It would be
a great new start for me.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.506
I want your row house.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.540
That's my home.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.476
My daddy comes home tomorrow.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.044
Only miner pulled out
alive after the disaster

00:12.046 --> 00:13.245
Is coming home from
the hospital tomorrow,

00:13.247 --> 00:15.047
A new business
is thriving.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.548
This town
is growing fast.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.255
All right, children,
bring your signs.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.690
The stagecoach will
be here any minute.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.592
What?

00:26.594 --> 00:27.593
[clears throat]

00:27.595 --> 00:28.560
Nothing.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.229
Looks like
you've been busy.

00:30.231 --> 00:34.266
The children are beyond excited
to welcome home mr. Miller.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.602
Five months in the hospital
is a long time.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.571
I'm sure it will be
a bittersweet day for everyone.

00:39.573 --> 00:43.275
Yes, hopefully more sweet
than bitter.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.576
Hi!

00:44.578 --> 00:46.311
You must be very excited.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.680
He's the top miner in town,
did you know that?

00:48.682 --> 00:50.516
He once dug two miles
through the mountain

00:50.518 --> 00:54.219
Yes, I believe you've
mentioned it a time or two.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.220
[giggles]

00:55.222 --> 00:57.189
You look silly.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.258
What do you mean, sweetie?

01:00.393 --> 01:01.693
Uh...

01:01.695 --> 01:03.195
I have paint on my nose,

01:03.197 --> 01:04.596
Don't I?

01:06.399 --> 01:08.500
How long were you going to
let me go on like that?

01:08.502 --> 01:10.669
I don't know,

01:10.671 --> 01:12.671
All day?

01:14.508 --> 01:17.242
[mrs. Miller]:
I'm so nervous to see him.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.511
He wouldn't let me
visit him in the hospital.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.146
Said we couldn't afford it.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.181
Yeah, well,
he's a proud man.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.215
All the men
in this town are.

01:23.217 --> 01:26.351
[girl]: Look, here he comes!

01:26.353 --> 01:27.686
All right, children,
hold up your signs.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.250
[crowd falls silent]

02:01.754 --> 02:04.556
What's wrong
with daddy's leg?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.291
Hush now, morgan rose.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.332
Princess?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.235
Sweetheart.

02:17.570 --> 02:18.637
Laurel...

02:19.672 --> 02:21.740
I didn't know
how to tell you.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.709
I love you.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.844
I'm glad you're back.

02:31.684 --> 02:34.386
Welcome home, adam.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.488
Thank you,
mrs. Montgomery.

02:38.591 --> 02:39.591
Let me.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.826
No, no, no.

02:40.828 --> 02:44.596
I can still
do for myself.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.366
[man]:
Welcome home, adam.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.367
[woman]: Welcome
home, adam.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.635
[man]: Welcome back,
mr. Miller.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.304
[man]: Welcome
back, adam.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.739
Laurel didn't know,
did she?

02:53.741 --> 02:55.774
I don't think so.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.786
[♪]

03:14.761 --> 03:17.529
That must have been quite
a surprise for mrs. Miller

03:17.531 --> 03:19.565
And those poor girls.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.466
They're a strong
family of faith.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.235
They'll get
through this.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.803
It's almost barbaric
that in this day and age

03:24.805 --> 03:26.605
A hospital would
issue a peg-leg

03:26.607 --> 03:29.341
When they have
prosthetics available.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.310
We're people of modest means.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.778
I'm sure that
that's all adam could afford.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.347
Well, if nothing else,

03:35.349 --> 03:37.683
The f.D. Play will lift
everyone's spirits.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.451
What is the f-d play?

03:39.453 --> 03:40.819
Founder's day play?

03:42.522 --> 03:44.256
Don't tell me you haven't
begun the rehearsals?

03:44.258 --> 03:48.393
Mrs. Ramsey, I have no idea
what you're referring to.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.329
My goodness,
no one's told her.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.430
Is that possible?

03:51.432 --> 03:52.497
Every year, the children

03:52.499 --> 03:54.266
Put on a play.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.367
It's in celebration

03:55.369 --> 03:57.569
Of the history
of coal valley.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.704
That's lovely,

03:58.706 --> 04:00.505
But given the fact
that I was unaware,

04:00.507 --> 04:03.875
Perhaps we might
postpone it a week or two--

04:03.877 --> 04:05.644
And celebrate on some date
besides the actual anniversary?

04:05.646 --> 04:06.645
It's almost a sacrilege.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.347
The mayor
won't hear of it.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.514
The mayor's
your husband.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.683
Mrs. Appleton always did
such an amazing job.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.453
Everyone looks forward
to hearing

04:14.455 --> 04:15.654
The mayor's eloquent speech

04:15.656 --> 04:17.589
As he guides us
towards a new year

04:17.591 --> 04:18.590
Filled with--

04:18.592 --> 04:19.625
Filled with, dear?

04:19.627 --> 04:20.659
Oh, never mind, silas.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.528
I will get you
a copy of the play

04:23.530 --> 04:25.731
So you can begin rehearsals
immediately.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.933
Okay.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.870
Cat...

04:31.872 --> 04:33.772
How am I going to pull
all this together in a week?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.674
Abigail and I are moving
out of the row houses

04:35.676 --> 04:38.377
And I promised her I'd help get
the cafe ready for business,

04:38.379 --> 04:39.444
And I still have lessons
to prepare--

04:39.446 --> 04:41.546
Okay, don't worry.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.749
The mothers are going
to pitch in.

04:43.751 --> 04:47.419
To drop by the costumes
and the backdrop,

04:47.421 --> 04:48.654
And I should probably go home

04:48.656 --> 04:49.821
And find
the sheet music.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.423
There's music, too?

04:51.425 --> 04:52.658
Yeah.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.694
Don't panic.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.730
You crossed a prairie,
for heaven's sake.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.965
How difficult could it be
to produce a play?

04:59.967 --> 05:01.566
Talking to yourself.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.734
That's not a good sign.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.369
You were eavesdropping.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.405
When one is talking
to one's self

05:06.407 --> 05:10.442
I have to put on
a founder's day play in a week.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.843
A play that has been
performed every year.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.413
A play that apparently
has costumes and music...

05:14.415 --> 05:15.647
Okay, elizabeth,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.716
Come here, come here.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.718
Sit down.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.453
Sit.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.955
Now, take a deep breath
in through your nose

05:23.957 --> 05:26.024
And out
through your mouth.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.598
There.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.900
Now, don't you feel better?

05:36.602 --> 05:38.503
I do.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.444
An entire production?

05:45.446 --> 05:46.645
[sighing]

05:54.754 --> 05:57.022
[reading quietly to herself]

06:04.931 --> 06:06.698
Oh!

06:06.700 --> 06:07.866
[book clattering]

06:07.868 --> 06:09.401
Were you talking
to yourself again?

06:09.403 --> 06:11.503
I'm beginning to worry
about your mental health.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.038
It's this play.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.940
I hardly slept a wink
last night.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.041
I've never
directed a play before.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.476
Well, didn't they
go through that

06:17.478 --> 06:19.010
In that big city university
you attended?

06:19.012 --> 06:20.779
I didn't go
to drama school, jack.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.114
I went to teacher college.

06:22.116 --> 06:26.718
"no great dramatist exists
without a touch of madness."

06:27.720 --> 06:29.955
Aristotle.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.023
Well, aren't you
just full of surprises.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.792
Yes.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.594
Have I thanked you yet
for helping us move?

06:35.596 --> 06:36.995
About a hundred times.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.964
Thank you.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.938
And the rains made it
difficult to cross..."

06:46.940 --> 06:47.939
[gasping]

06:47.941 --> 06:50.475
Oh, no! Oh!

06:50.477 --> 06:53.011
Elizabeth, are you okay?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.579
How could I have been
so careless?

06:54.581 --> 06:55.647
It was an accident.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.915
No, no, this was my fault.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.049
I wasn't looking
where I was going--

06:58.051 --> 06:59.818
It's okay.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.620
Abigail,
please, let me.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.988
No, I-I've got it.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.457
Of course, I will reimburse you
for the vase.

07:05.459 --> 07:09.060
This has been held together
by glue for years.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.630
I mean, peter broke it
three or four times.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.900
I always told him
not to play ball in the house.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.902
Oh, abigail,
I'm so sorry.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.937
It's not the vase.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.740
We built a life here together,
the three of us.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.143
I can only imagine
how difficult this is for you.

07:31.818 --> 07:34.653
I think I would like to
take this vase with me, too.

07:35.688 --> 07:36.721
Of course.

07:36.723 --> 07:37.789
I'll go get the glue.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.859
Elizabeth.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.727
I'm...

07:42.729 --> 07:44.796
Really happy
I'm not in this alone.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.899
Me, too, abigail.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.702
We're both embarking
on a new adventure.

No...

08:29.142 --> 08:30.876
Your daddy's tired,

I love you.

I love you, too.

A hundred times

08:48.862 --> 08:50.195
They are
daddy's girls.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.998
I missed them.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.233
I missed you, too.

08:57.136 --> 09:00.105
I know I'm never going to be
the man I was.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.908
You're the best man
I have ever known

09:02.910 --> 09:04.175
And nothing
will ever change that.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.645
That is just wishful thinking.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.213
I know better.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.915
I'm not going to fit in.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.018
There's no place for a man
in my position.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.653
What do I have to offer?

09:14.655 --> 09:17.989
Love and guidance
for those girls,

09:17.991 --> 09:20.225
And for me, there will never
be another man.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.094
I'm not what I was.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.737
I loved you then,
and I love you now

09:32.739 --> 09:35.874
And nothing
will ever change that.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.756
This is going to take
some getting used to.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.059
It'll feel like home
in no time.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.661
I'm sure
you're right.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.664
It's like you said when
we first started packing,

09:59.666 --> 10:00.832
"love travels with you..."

10:00.834 --> 10:03.768
"wherever you go."

10:03.770 --> 10:06.838
"wherever you go."

10:09.108 --> 10:10.742
Children...

10:10.744 --> 10:13.912
May I have
your attention, please?

10:13.914 --> 10:18.883
Today, we are going to cancel
our math lesson.

10:18.885 --> 10:22.854
In fact, we are going to cancel
all of our lessons.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.956
We're going to start rehearsing
for our founder's day play,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.225
Which we will perform
this Saturday.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.259
Now, how many of you
know the song?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.260
Saturday?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.262
In a week?

10:31.264 --> 10:34.099
Last year, mrs. Appleton
had us practicing for a month.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.134
Well, I'm not mrs. Appleton,

10:36.136 --> 10:37.969
And you all have performed
this play before,

10:37.971 --> 10:41.139
So I'm--
I'm not worried at all.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.708
And he graduated school
months ago.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.778
Yes, well, we'll just
have to get started

10:46.780 --> 10:48.079
And try our best.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.949
Now, I'm going to need
everyone to help me.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.718
Maybe some of the older students
could help me with the...

10:53.720 --> 10:56.921
Jolene, morgan rose!

10:56.923 --> 10:59.090
I thought you two were
going to stay at home today

10:59.092 --> 11:00.725
And spend the day
with your father.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.127
We changed
our minds.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.929
Pa said he needs to
take care of some business.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.265
My daddy only has
one leg now.

11:09.135 --> 11:13.171
Well, what matters
is that he's home now, right?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.006
Yes, ma'am.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.077
I found
the sheet music!

11:19.079 --> 11:21.179
In my attic.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.881
Cat, that's wonderful.
One item off my list.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.215
There ain't no way

11:24.217 --> 11:25.283
We can learn this play
in one week.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.753
Now, children,

11:28.755 --> 11:29.921
If I may, elizabeth?

11:31.724 --> 11:33.892
Miss thatcher is going to need
all of your help

11:33.894 --> 11:36.327
And your concentration for this.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.863
It's a very important play
to all of us,

11:38.865 --> 11:41.399
Especially
after the year that we've had.

11:45.237 --> 11:47.105
[panting with effort]

11:47.107 --> 11:50.241
The good news is that
I found the costumes.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.012
[coughing]

11:54.014 --> 11:55.246
Oh...

11:58.384 --> 12:00.785
Did you store these
at the church?

12:00.787 --> 12:01.986
That would be the bad news.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.354
Oh, my goodness,
they're all singed!

12:03.356 --> 12:04.856
This is horrible.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.357
Well, it is a play
about a coal mine.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.859
We could make this into
one of the miners' costumes.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.394
It's already blackened.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.129
[elizabeth]:
And what about the backdrop?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.331
Or is it best
not to ask about that?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.102
Church fire, too?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.070
More of the bad news.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.371
How are we supposed to
have a play

12:20.373 --> 12:21.906
Without a backdrop?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.776
Noah stanton
painted the last one.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.945
I don't know anyone else

12:26.947 --> 12:28.413
Who has that skill

12:28.415 --> 12:31.116
Left in coal valley.

12:32.818 --> 12:33.885
[sighs bravely]

12:33.887 --> 12:36.354
Boys and girls,

12:36.356 --> 12:37.889
If there's one thing
I've learned

12:37.891 --> 12:39.157
About the people of coal valley,

12:39.159 --> 12:41.059
It's that they don't quit,

12:41.061 --> 12:43.228
Even when everything
is against them,

12:43.230 --> 12:46.097
So we are not going to quit.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.166
Now, I don't know exactly how,

12:48.168 --> 12:50.435
But this Saturday,

12:50.437 --> 12:53.037
We are going to do
founder's day proud.

12:53.039 --> 12:53.905
[clattering]

12:53.907 --> 12:55.240
Oh!

13:02.214 --> 13:03.915
I know you're
a busy man, mr. Gowen,

13:03.917 --> 13:05.250
So I'll get
right to the point.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.253
Of course, what can I
do for you, mr. Miller.

13:08.255 --> 13:12.056
I appreciate the company's
generosity with my family

13:12.058 --> 13:13.324
While I was recovering.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.261
Well, it's the least
that we could do.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.196
Please, sit.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.464
Thank you.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.339
I was, uh...

13:28.341 --> 13:33.344
Unaware of the extent
of your injuries,

13:33.346 --> 13:35.346
But you're a fighter

13:35.348 --> 13:38.082
And the company does appreciate
your sacrifice.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.418
Yes, sir.

13:40.420 --> 13:44.956
The thing is, I need work.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.091
I don't understand.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.860
I'm not askin'
to go back in the mine, sir.

13:48.862 --> 13:49.994
I know I can't do that.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.964
That there might be
somethin' else

13:52.966 --> 13:56.267
I mean, maybe I could
work behind a desk?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.236
Or, uh...

13:58.238 --> 14:00.972
Or help the superintendent out
in some way.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.373
I don't know if we--

14:02.375 --> 14:05.076
Look, I'll do anything.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.280
Sir.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.417
Anything.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.185
I need to provide for my family.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.425
I will speak with mr. Ansvil

14:20.427 --> 14:22.493
And I'll see what I can do.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.131
Great.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.166
Thank you, sir.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.068
Pleasure.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.981
[door opens and closes]

14:42.983 --> 14:44.415
Have you sewn yourself
to the back of the chair yet?

14:44.417 --> 14:47.285
No!

14:47.287 --> 14:49.921
But apparently,
I won't be wearing this

14:49.923 --> 14:51.155
For the rest of the day.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.323
Look what I have--

14:52.325 --> 14:54.158
Compliments of the mayor
and dottie ramsey.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.561
Enough fabric to make
new costumes.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.429
Oh, my goodness!
That's so generous.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.430
Yes.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.232
However, there is a small price.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.137
The star of the play
will now be their son.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.039
Oh...

15:08.041 --> 15:10.108
Well, I suppose
we can afford that.

15:10.110 --> 15:14.112
And dottie will also be
the master of ceremonies.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.047
She will?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.048
Oh, yes.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.517
It's a coal valley tradition.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.030
Hi, elizabeth.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.464
Jack.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.967
I brought you
some saloon cornbread.

15:35.969 --> 15:36.968
Although it doesn't
hold a candle

15:36.970 --> 15:40.038
It's all we have
until she officially opens.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.539
[giggles] ow!

15:41.541 --> 15:43.074
The needle attack you?

15:43.076 --> 15:45.076
Wouldn't be
the first time today.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.411
[chuckles]

15:46.413 --> 15:48.546
So your cooking is only rivaled
by your sewing.

15:50.983 --> 15:52.317
I suppose you could do better?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.484
[chuckles]

15:53.486 --> 15:54.552
May I?

16:00.993 --> 16:02.493
I think a whipstitch
will do here.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.728
[giggles]

16:08.267 --> 16:09.600
Where did you
learn that?

16:09.602 --> 16:12.036
Oh, I've sewn before.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.472
Where?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.407
Uh...

16:16.409 --> 16:17.575
Close to the bone.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.477
What?

16:23.615 --> 16:26.017
Oh, my goodness.
What happened?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.251
It was nothing.

16:27.253 --> 16:32.190
Although the bear
is still talking about it.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.130
Welcome back, adam.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.165
Thank you, liam.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.400
Mr. Gowen's
got me so busy

16:42.402 --> 16:45.603
I've really fallen behind
on the load reconciliation.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.538
I'm really grateful to
have you helping me out here.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.174
Oh, thank you,
mr. Ansvil.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.511
It's still herbert, adam.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.079
You need to enter
the weights here

16:55.081 --> 16:56.280
At the end of the day.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.483
And that's how we know
how much to pay them.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.584
Mm-hmm.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.553
I always remember you being

17:02.555 --> 17:03.588
At the top
of this list.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.224
[shift whistle blaring]

17:07.459 --> 17:09.694
You okay?

17:09.696 --> 17:12.230
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.398
No problem.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.699
Uh, well, I'll get on this

17:14.701 --> 17:16.300
Right away.

17:16.302 --> 17:19.404
Well, it's good to be back,
mr. Ansvil.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.672
Herbert, adam. Herbert.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.375
Herbert.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.317
I picked
these flowers for pa.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.454
That's very thoughtful
of you, sweetheart.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.389
I'll put them in a vase.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.690
Now, why don't you
tell your pa

17:39.692 --> 17:41.492
That supper's
almost ready.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.264
[yelps]

18:21.633 --> 18:23.234
Princess...

18:23.236 --> 18:24.235
What's wrong?

18:24.237 --> 18:25.636
What happened?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.538
I don't know, I was dreaming.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.207
I guess I...

18:29.209 --> 18:30.575
Are you okay?

18:32.244 --> 18:34.445
It's okay.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.646
He didn't mean to.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.149
I'm okay.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.617
I'm all right...

18:58.403 --> 19:01.405
Oh, my lord.

19:01.407 --> 19:04.275
This wasn't here yesterday.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.477
Where on earth...?

19:13.218 --> 19:15.219
Thank you
for helping with this.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.255
Oh, it is mostly
selfish on my part.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.289
The sooner you open,

19:18.291 --> 19:19.590
The sooner
I get to eat here.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.592
And the sooner
I can start cooking

19:21.594 --> 19:22.660
For hordes of hungry miners.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.599
You seem like a natural
with a paintbrush.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.302
Well, I like painting.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.305
Walls.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.306
Perhaps you might consider

19:35.308 --> 19:37.341
Painting a...

19:37.343 --> 19:38.442
Mural on one.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.511
Mural?

19:40.513 --> 19:44.248
Yes, a nice view of coal valley?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.317
Perhaps some
beautiful mountains.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.554
Now, where would you get
an idea like that?

19:51.823 --> 19:55.226
Noah painted
the old founder's day mural.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.694
You know, it takes
a special kind of person

19:56.696 --> 19:59.330
To see things
from an artist's perspective.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.332
I wouldn't know.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.301
Wouldn't you?

20:04.436 --> 20:08.306
No. I'm just a simple
wall painter, ma'am.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.679
Don't worry.
I won't tell elizabeth.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.398
You're home.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.901
How was
the mine today?

20:37.836 --> 20:39.537
The same.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.340
Well...

20:42.342 --> 20:44.842
I have
a surprise for you.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.545
Open it, daddy!

20:47.547 --> 20:48.713
See what it is.

20:53.352 --> 20:54.452
I sent away for it.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.588
It came
on the stage today.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.365
Isn't it wonderful?

21:07.367 --> 21:09.400
You'll be able to do
many things

21:09.402 --> 21:10.568
Like you used to,

21:10.570 --> 21:13.404
And not be limited
by that peg

21:13.406 --> 21:14.939
The hospital gave you.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.910
[slams case shut]

21:19.912 --> 21:21.479
Don't you like it, pa?

21:22.681 --> 21:24.815
Where'd you get
the money for this?

21:28.687 --> 21:30.521
I...

21:30.523 --> 21:33.824
Used some of our savings
for part of it

21:33.826 --> 21:34.959
And abigail stanton helped me

21:34.961 --> 21:37.828
Take up a collection
for the rest.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.597
You passed the hat
on my behalf?

21:39.599 --> 21:41.932
Everyone
was happy to pitch in.

21:43.535 --> 21:44.702
This town
loves you, adam.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.437
[roaring angrily]

21:47.839 --> 21:49.440
Adam, you're
scaring the girls.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.941
Ain't it enough
that I'm a cripple?

21:52.778 --> 21:55.379
You gotta turn me
into a charity case, too?

21:55.381 --> 21:56.714
I just wanted to help.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.416
How?

21:58.418 --> 22:01.786
By giving me
this useless scrap of wood?

22:01.788 --> 22:05.856
We have to accept the hand
the lord has dealt us

22:05.858 --> 22:07.491
And do our best
with it.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.828
Things could have
been far worse.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.997
I can't even hold down a job,

22:12.999 --> 22:15.599
Let alone
do anything else.

22:15.601 --> 22:18.736
What do you mean
you can't hold down a job?

22:18.738 --> 22:22.406
I can't work at that mine
any longer.

22:22.408 --> 22:24.809
I... I can't handle it.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.677
I quit.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.883
When?

22:32.885 --> 22:34.452
This morning.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.755
And...

22:37.757 --> 22:39.523
What have you been
doing all day?

22:40.759 --> 22:42.626
Walking around.

22:42.628 --> 22:43.894
Oh, if that's what
you can call it.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.897
And when were you
planning on telling me?

22:46.899 --> 22:49.500
Or were you just gonna lie,

22:49.502 --> 22:50.034
Like you did
about your condition

22:50.036 --> 22:51.435
All those months?

22:51.437 --> 22:52.903
I never lied to you.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.038
You lied every day
you laid in that hospital bed

22:54.040 --> 22:55.039
And you didn't tell me!

22:55.041 --> 22:57.475
I'm a half a man, laurel!

22:58.710 --> 23:00.845
That's something
you'll never understand!

23:00.847 --> 23:04.415
And if you're just
gonna give up,

23:04.417 --> 23:05.816
Why did you come home at all?

23:05.818 --> 23:07.985
[gasping in shock]

23:16.928 --> 23:18.496
Adam...

23:19.798 --> 23:22.032
I'm sorry.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.704
[gasping in shock]

23:47.526 --> 23:48.626
[stifling sobs]

23:49.795 --> 23:51.762
Okay, cassandra,
we're going to try this again.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.832
Let's take it
from the top.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.735
For some of us,
the rains stopped...

23:57.737 --> 24:01.539
And then the crops dried up.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.506
Okay, now we change
the placard,

24:02.508 --> 24:03.607
And now it's jolene.

24:08.847 --> 24:11.849
For those of us

24:11.851 --> 24:13.784
Who were struggling
to meet our end...

24:13.786 --> 24:15.786
"to make ends meet."

24:15.788 --> 24:18.889
For those
who were making ends meet...

24:18.891 --> 24:22.726
Who were struggling
to make ends meet."

24:24.963 --> 24:26.997
Jolene!

24:26.999 --> 24:28.132
Oh...

24:28.134 --> 24:29.934
Just... Just...

24:29.936 --> 24:31.969
Keep rehearsing your lines.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.671
I'll be right back.

24:55.627 --> 24:56.994
We're all
tired, jolene.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.963
And everyone forgets
a line once in a while--

24:58.965 --> 25:01.932
I know the lines.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.168
I'm just not sure
I believe them anymore.

25:06.071 --> 25:09.173
Look what happened to
all the fathers

25:09.175 --> 25:10.774
Who came here
to work in the mine.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.910
Look what happened to my pa.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.879
I know how hard
this must be for you,

25:14.881 --> 25:16.113
Having him back

25:16.115 --> 25:18.682
After he was gone
for such a long time.

25:19.784 --> 25:23.087
My daddy never came back,
miss thatcher.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.655
Not the pa I knew.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.923
Jolene...

25:25.925 --> 25:27.958
Just because
he may not look the same--

25:27.960 --> 25:29.126
I'm not talking...

25:30.061 --> 25:31.762
About his leg.

25:33.798 --> 25:36.066
He's changed.
He's not the same person,

25:36.068 --> 25:37.268
And I don't know why.

25:40.071 --> 25:42.806
I know it's hard to believe,

25:42.808 --> 25:45.042
But even our mamas
and our daddies

25:45.044 --> 25:46.677
Have struggles sometimes.

25:46.679 --> 25:50.047
I just want everything
to be like it was before.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.590
All you can do
is love him.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.192
You can't be responsible
for how he acts,

26:02.194 --> 26:03.928
All right?

26:06.631 --> 26:07.765
Come here.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.966
It's okay.

26:10.001 --> 26:12.036
It's all right.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.772
You're all right.

26:22.714 --> 26:23.781
Jack.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.184
Where did that
come from?

26:27.186 --> 26:29.186
Your guess
is as good as mine.

26:35.226 --> 26:36.727
Laurel, what's wrong?

26:36.729 --> 26:37.728
Constable,
it's adam.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.163
I need your help.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.165
We had an argument last night,

26:41.167 --> 26:42.866
And he wasn't in the house

26:42.868 --> 26:44.034
When we woke up
this morning.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.104
I just thought he needed
some time to think.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.206
But he hasn't come home all day,
and I...

26:49.208 --> 26:50.975
I found a note.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.811
I must have
missed it.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.847
You and the girls are
better off without me."

26:56.849 --> 26:58.015
We had words,

26:58.017 --> 26:59.149
Terrible words,

26:59.151 --> 27:00.184
And I didn't mean what I said,

27:00.186 --> 27:02.086
I swear it.

27:02.088 --> 27:05.189
It's just, I'm afraid
he's gonna do something awful.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.059
Don't worry.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.160
I will find him.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.100
Jack!

27:23.675 --> 27:24.808
Please be careful.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.879
I'm glad to see you be
so concerned for your constable.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.049
I'm concerned for my constable,

27:32.051 --> 27:34.752
For the man who wears
the constable's uniform.

28:24.169 --> 28:25.169
Whoa.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.138
Mr. Miller?

28:35.313 --> 28:38.115
You're gonna have to shoot me
if you want to take me back.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.883
Come on, mr. Miller.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.285
You know I didn't come here
to shoot anybody.

28:41.287 --> 28:44.121
No, just to stick your nose
in my family's business.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.056
They are worried sick
about you.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.925
It is my choice if I want to
leave town or not, constable.

28:47.927 --> 28:48.992
Is there a law against that?

28:48.994 --> 28:50.294
No argument from me.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.197
Your wife might
see it differently.

28:53.199 --> 28:56.200
You think a man is free
to desert his family?

28:57.936 --> 28:59.403
They don't want me.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.005
Never came back
from that hospital.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.007
Mr. Miller,
there is more to a man

29:04.009 --> 29:05.109
Than flesh and bone.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.810
You still have purpose.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.146
And the almighty can bless
the work of your hands.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.282
All right,
don't you play with me.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.385
I know who I am.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.387
I got nothing to offer.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.823
So, what's the plan?

29:19.825 --> 29:22.793
Are you going to
waste away out here

29:22.795 --> 29:23.961
Until you die?

29:23.963 --> 29:25.295
Here's the plan,

29:25.297 --> 29:28.031
Just leave me alone.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.307
What do you think
you're doing.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.176
I'll head back at first light.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.912
Yeah, you suit yourself,
constable,

29:41.914 --> 29:45.315
But you'll be traveling
back tomorrow by yourself.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.350
That's your choice,
mr. Miller.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.920
You're damn right it is!

29:59.430 --> 30:00.898
Everything okay?

30:00.900 --> 30:01.965
I can't sleep.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.181
I'm scared.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.182
Daddy's gone,

30:18.184 --> 30:19.850
And he's never
coming back.

30:19.852 --> 30:20.918
No, that's not true.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.020
He just...

30:23.022 --> 30:24.888
He needs some time

30:24.890 --> 30:26.223
To get used to
things being different.

30:28.092 --> 30:31.395
[sighs]

30:31.397 --> 30:33.230
When he was gone before

30:33.232 --> 30:36.133
In the hospital,

30:36.135 --> 30:40.237
I knew he was coming home.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.540
Now I'm not sure.

30:46.144 --> 30:50.380
Well, we are just going to
have to pray for the strength

30:50.382 --> 30:53.150
To hold on until he does.

31:06.464 --> 31:07.531
I'm cooking up some fish

31:07.533 --> 31:10.200
If you're hungry.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.169
And come and get warm.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.337
There's no point
freezing

31:13.339 --> 31:15.339
When I got a fire going.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.414
You know,
when I was growing up,

31:57.416 --> 32:01.385
I thought my father
hung the moon.

32:03.054 --> 32:04.154
I know your girls
feel the same way

32:04.156 --> 32:06.156
About you.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.992
They used to.

32:08.994 --> 32:10.394
Everything's changed.

32:12.398 --> 32:17.200
And I cannot imagine
what you've been through,

32:17.202 --> 32:21.338
I have an idea
of what your girls are feeling.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.608
See, my father,

32:24.610 --> 32:28.345
He was a mountie,

32:28.347 --> 32:31.581
And when I was a boy,

32:31.583 --> 32:35.285
All I wanted to do
was be like my pa.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.088
I used to walk around the house
all day,

32:38.090 --> 32:41.291
Wearing his hat,
pretending I was him.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.160
But mounties
aren't around very much.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.362
They're gone
for months at a time.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.463
And that's hard, too.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.398
It was hard on my mom.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.400
Having a father who's away
providing for his family

32:50.402 --> 32:54.204
Is different than a father
who's a burden.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.573
And then he got hurt.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.211
So he came home.

33:02.613 --> 33:07.217
Doctor said
he had trauma to the skull.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.354
Yeah.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.490
I never left his side.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.660
He promised me
that he'd get stronger

33:16.662 --> 33:20.130
And he'd teach me
to be a man like him.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.171
Then one day, he was gone.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.579
Well, we all...

33:35.581 --> 33:39.282
Lose the life
and the people we love.

33:39.284 --> 33:41.385
I was bitter like you.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.221
I blamed god,

33:44.223 --> 33:47.657
I even blamed my father
for leaving me.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.494
But time went by,

33:50.496 --> 33:53.230
And I made
my peace with it.

33:54.265 --> 33:56.299
You think
I want to be out here?

33:59.170 --> 34:03.273
You think I want to be
away from my family?

34:08.179 --> 34:11.181
This is what I have to do.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.649
Really?

34:12.651 --> 34:16.586
The thing is,
my father didn't have a choice.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.255
You do.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.461
I know you're scared.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.397
But you're the same man

34:27.399 --> 34:30.700
Who woke up every morning
and went into that mine.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.237
You put your life
on the line

34:34.239 --> 34:35.405
Every day
for your family.

34:35.407 --> 34:40.343
In my book,
that's as brave as it comes.

34:40.345 --> 34:44.114
But now you've got to find
a way out of that mine,

34:44.116 --> 34:47.617
Back into life.

34:47.619 --> 34:52.222
I've got to believe that
you were spared for a reason.

34:54.258 --> 34:56.126
I've got to believe that
you were given a second chance

34:56.128 --> 34:57.527
Because there's more
for you to do.

34:57.529 --> 35:02.199
Like watching
those girls grow up.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.536
I'm gonna head
back to town at dawn,

35:06.538 --> 35:08.438
And I hope you join me.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.480
But it's your choice.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.731
Welcome, everyone,

35:34.733 --> 35:37.167
To our founder's day
celebration.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.301
[applause]

35:41.439 --> 35:42.472
The mayor and I,

35:42.474 --> 35:44.241
Along with our son, bradley,

35:44.243 --> 35:45.575
Are so pleased

35:45.577 --> 35:46.810
You all have come to the show.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.412
[applause]

35:50.381 --> 35:54.251
And now for the moment
you've all been waiting for,

35:54.253 --> 35:56.620
I'd like to introduce
our current mayor,

35:56.622 --> 35:57.621
And my husband,

35:57.623 --> 35:59.322
Silas ramsey,

35:59.324 --> 36:01.525
Who will inaugurate
this evening's performance.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.760
[applause]

36:06.230 --> 36:11.234
Reminding us of our past
brings us hope for the future.

36:11.236 --> 36:14.504
[applause]

36:15.706 --> 36:17.641
And now, miss thatcher

36:17.643 --> 36:19.576
And the players
of the coal valley school

36:19.578 --> 36:21.645
Bring you "founder's day."

36:32.456 --> 36:34.691
Before coal valley,

36:34.693 --> 36:38.395
For some of us,
the rains stopped.

36:38.397 --> 36:40.330
And then the crops
dried up...

36:40.332 --> 36:41.498
[whispering]
jolene, are you ready?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.433
I think so.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.434
Okay.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.603
Factories
like the candle company

36:46.605 --> 36:48.438
Closed their doors

36:48.440 --> 36:50.674
And we needed to find
a new place to live.

36:52.443 --> 36:55.545
[whispering]

38:38.416 --> 38:40.350
Hey, I never noticed
that before.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.452
What is that?

38:42.454 --> 38:44.387
I think
the bigger question is,

38:44.389 --> 38:45.622
"who is that?"

38:46.724 --> 38:47.891
May I borrow
your magnifying glass,

38:47.893 --> 38:49.359
Miss thatcher?

38:49.361 --> 38:50.460
Certainly.

39:03.709 --> 39:06.943
James, come get
a load of this.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.446
[giggling]

39:13.551 --> 39:14.617
There.

39:15.686 --> 39:16.753
[laughing]

39:16.755 --> 39:18.955
Well, I'll be.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.457
What's so funny, you three?

39:20.459 --> 39:21.958
Come see for yourself,
miss thatcher.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.032
Thank you.

39:32.470 --> 39:33.470
Where?

39:33.472 --> 39:34.671
There.

39:38.943 --> 39:41.745
[gasps]
oh, my goodness.

39:42.748 --> 39:46.649
Why would we know anything
about this, miss thatcher?

39:46.651 --> 39:48.451
We weren't the ones
who painted the backdrop.

39:48.453 --> 39:51.421
It does look a lot like
you and mountie jack, though.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.789
No, it
doesn't, james.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.524
It doesn't at all,

39:54.526 --> 39:55.592
And I'll ask
that you three

39:55.594 --> 39:56.726
Forget all about
this incident.

39:57.862 --> 40:00.563
Lips are sealed,
miss thatcher.

40:04.468 --> 40:05.869
I knew it.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.673
[sighs]

40:17.948 --> 40:19.682
Jack,
are you aware

40:19.684 --> 40:20.683
That someone painted

40:20.685 --> 40:21.651
A tiny likeness
of the two of us

40:21.653 --> 40:22.919
On the founder's day
backdrop?

40:22.921 --> 40:25.688
Yes, and it's hidden there
like a little stick of dynamite

40:25.690 --> 40:28.625
And some of my students
just lit the fuse.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.126
What are we doing
in the painting?

40:31.729 --> 40:32.896
I...

40:32.898 --> 40:34.831
I can't really say.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.566
W-we're...

40:36.568 --> 40:37.700
We're kissing.

40:37.702 --> 40:38.802
We're kissing?

40:38.804 --> 40:40.637
Well, that is

40:40.639 --> 40:42.705
Completely inappropriate.

40:42.707 --> 40:43.706
Pure fiction.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.842
Yes, fiction.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.844
Who would paint such a thing?

40:48.946 --> 40:50.580
You know, I think I should
launch an investigation,

40:50.582 --> 40:52.582
Interrogate
some of your students

40:52.584 --> 40:54.050
Until we get to
the bottom of this.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.585
Uh, all right,

40:55.587 --> 40:57.487
But on second thought,

40:57.489 --> 40:59.088
Both of our reputations
are on the line here.

40:59.090 --> 41:02.625
Hmm, that is
a good point.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.961
But I promise,

41:04.963 --> 41:06.529
I will get
to the bottom of this,

41:06.531 --> 41:07.564
Don't you worry.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.565
[sighs happily]

41:08.567 --> 41:09.766
I'm glad
you're on the case.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.167
[dog barks]

41:12.536 --> 41:14.070
I'm going to go.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.072
[clears throat]
have a good day.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.807
[door closes sharply]

41:17.809 --> 41:19.609
[barks]

41:30.588 --> 41:31.855
Our little secret, boy.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.656
[barking]

41:35.893 --> 41:39.796
[♪]
