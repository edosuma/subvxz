02:50.769 --> 02:53.571
Teacher: Okay, we've got a
four-word sentence here for you.

02:53.605 --> 02:55.206

Vanessa: Cat.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.867
Teacher: Perfect, you've got it.

03:22.901 --> 03:25.003
Now let's continue

03:25.036 --> 03:28.139
Vanessa: Dr-- drin--

03:28.173 --> 03:31.643

Teacher: You've got it.
That's it exactly.

03:46.091 --> 03:47.559
You did it.

03:47.592 --> 03:48.626
Perfect, perfect girl.

03:48.660 --> 03:55.934

03:55.967 --> 03:57.102
Chopper: All right.

03:57.135 --> 03:58.370

03:58.403 --> 04:01.006
Great. Great Vanessa.

04:05.210 --> 04:06.778
Vanessa! Chopper!

04:10.482 --> 04:12.650
Are we rewarded now?

04:12.684 --> 04:15.220
(up-tempo music)

04:42.814 --> 04:45.684
Ramona: Hey mister,
I got my own place.

04:45.717 --> 04:46.718
Man: M-mm. (negative)

04:46.751 --> 04:48.319
Ramona: It's right over
there in the hotel.

04:48.353 --> 04:49.587
Man: M-mm. (negative)

04:49.621 --> 04:51.022
Ramona: You can turn right
here and just get in.

04:51.056 --> 04:52.757
It's cooler. Then can I
get in the car with you?

04:52.791 --> 04:54.092
Man: M-mm. (negative)

04:54.125 --> 04:55.727
Ramona: Please sir. I'll
go wherever you want to go.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.195
I'll go where ever
you want to go.

04:57.228 --> 04:58.463
Man: Move it, now.
No, thank you.

04:58.496 --> 04:59.697
Ramona: Come on sir. Sir!

04:59.731 --> 05:02.333
Well screw you too.
Fucking nigger.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.769
Vanessa: Mom, what
are you doing?

05:04.803 --> 05:06.704
Ramona: What are you
doing home so early?

05:06.738 --> 05:09.007
Vanessa: It's not so early, Mom.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.141
Chopper: How are
you doing Ms. Lutz?

05:10.175 --> 05:12.844
Vanessa: Don't even
talk to her Chopper.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.112
Chopper: Vanessa,
I'm out of here.

05:14.145 --> 05:15.380
Vanessa: Okay.

05:15.413 --> 05:17.449
Ramona: Will you give your
mom my regards for me?

05:17.482 --> 05:19.617
Chopper: Will do Ms. Lutz.

05:19.651 --> 05:21.419
Vanessa: You said you weren't
going to do this no more, Mom.

05:21.453 --> 05:23.555
Ramona: Listen, I've had enough
crap from your father all day.

05:23.588 --> 05:24.456
I'm really stressed out here.

05:24.489 --> 05:25.890
Vanessa: Larry is not my dad.

05:25.924 --> 05:27.358
Ramona: Listen if you're going
to smartass me you can just

05:27.392 --> 05:28.726
go on home right now.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.328
Get out of my face right now.

05:30.361 --> 05:31.696
Go on! Get out!

05:31.730 --> 05:33.765
Vanessa: Fine.

05:33.798 --> 05:34.966
Fine!

05:34.999 --> 05:36.668
Ramona: You don't know
nothing about nothing.

05:36.701 --> 05:39.604
You don't know a goddamn
thing about nothing.

05:45.043 --> 05:46.211
(train horn)

05:47.112 --> 05:49.848
Vanessa: Larry,
just let me through.

05:49.881 --> 05:52.217
Larry: What's the magic word?

05:52.250 --> 05:55.153
Vanessa: Fuck you,
you piece of shit.

05:55.186 --> 05:57.021
Larry: Fuck you?

06:09.767 --> 06:10.835
How was school?

06:10.869 --> 06:13.638
Vanessa: Like you
really fucking care.

06:13.671 --> 06:15.073
Asshole.

06:15.106 --> 06:17.375
Larry: Hey! Me and your
momma, we spent the whole day

06:17.408 --> 06:19.611
in line securing rent vouchers,
and we can both use a little

06:19.644 --> 06:22.413
consideration?!

06:27.018 --> 06:29.654
Vanessa: Don't it bother you
your own wife screwing

06:29.687 --> 06:31.589
off all them strange
guys for money?

06:31.623 --> 06:33.458
Larry: I make her
use mouthwash after.

06:33.491 --> 06:35.460
Vanessa: Oh you like that
minty fresh taste, huh?

06:35.493 --> 06:36.995
Larry: You know
something Vanessa Lutz?

06:37.028 --> 06:39.631
I'm getting ready to take a
seriously big shit right on top

06:39.664 --> 06:41.933
of that pointy
little head of yours.

06:41.966 --> 06:45.069
Don't be a smartass.

06:45.103 --> 06:47.405
Ramona: Hey motherfucker.

06:50.909 --> 06:52.644
You want some company?

06:52.677 --> 06:53.678
Man: Yeah.

06:53.711 --> 06:56.247
Ramona: Let me get in.

06:56.281 --> 07:00.118
(cartoons on TV)

07:00.151 --> 07:02.587
TV: We interrupt this program
to go live to L.A. County

07:02.620 --> 07:04.889
Sheriff's Headquarters where
a press conference is now

07:04.923 --> 07:08.793
in progress regarding the grisly
find yesterday morning along

07:08.826 --> 07:11.429
San Diego freeway in Torrance.

07:11.462 --> 07:13.665
Garnett: The two females
have been identified as

07:13.698 --> 07:15.900
19-year-old Tempest Mueller

07:15.934 --> 07:21.906
of Downey and 16-year-old
Corky Poindexter of Bellflower.

07:21.940 --> 07:25.643
Both females have extensive
arrest records for prostitution

07:25.677 --> 07:29.447
and we are now considering them
as victims of the individual

07:29.480 --> 07:34.719
that we call the I-5 killer.

07:34.752 --> 07:37.255
I'll take a few questions.

07:37.288 --> 07:39.791
Vanessa: I happen to
be watching that Larry.

07:39.824 --> 07:41.226
Larry: Forget it.

07:41.259 --> 07:42.560
Vanessa: You know you just
don't want me hearing about

07:42.594 --> 07:44.262
that killer out there.

07:44.295 --> 07:46.497
Well, what if he drove up
right this second and snatched

07:46.531 --> 07:48.199
up Mom, huh?

07:48.233 --> 07:50.368
What would you have
to say then, smart guy?

07:50.401 --> 07:55.206
Larry: (laughing) First of all,
your momma would kick his ass.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.244
And second of all, that killer
is all the way up in L.A., okay?

07:59.277 --> 08:01.913
(cartoons on TV)

08:32.710 --> 08:35.712
Vanessa: Larry, get your
goddamn hands off my anatomy.

08:35.746 --> 08:37.248
I swear to fucking God.

08:37.282 --> 08:38.883
Larry: What?

08:38.916 --> 08:40.485
What are you going to do?

08:40.518 --> 08:41.852
Vanessa: I'll tell mom.

08:41.885 --> 08:44.822
Larry: Oh yeah, like she's
really going to believe you.

08:44.856 --> 08:47.292
Vanessa: You know I'm really not
up for your shit today Larry.

08:47.325 --> 08:49.527
In fact, I'm mad as
hell at you right now.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.695
Larry: Awe, come here.

08:50.728 --> 08:52.497
Vanessa: Goddammit Larry!

08:52.530 --> 08:54.198
Get your fucking hands off me.

08:54.232 --> 08:55.333
You shithead.

08:55.366 --> 08:57.335
Larry: Ow!

08:57.368 --> 08:58.336
Vanessa: Fucker!

08:58.369 --> 09:02.106
Larry: Ah! Ah! You hit hard.

09:02.140 --> 09:05.043
Ow! Ow!

09:05.076 --> 09:06.544
Ow!

09:06.577 --> 09:09.080
Vanessa: You just behave.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.849
Larry: Fuck, you hit hard.

09:11.883 --> 09:14.619
Ramona: You know
I can't help you if you
don't tell me what it is

09:14.652 --> 09:16.921
you want.

09:16.955 --> 09:19.457
Man: Well, maybe we better
just forget the whole thing.

09:19.490 --> 09:22.493
Ramona: No.

09:22.527 --> 09:25.263
I bet you like having
your wiener sucked.

09:25.296 --> 09:27.165
Hmm? Don't you?

09:27.198 --> 09:29.233
Man dark car: Yeah, I guess so.

09:29.267 --> 09:32.937
Ramona: How come that
doesn't surprise me?

09:32.970 --> 09:35.606
Man: What would
a thing like that cost?

09:35.640 --> 09:40.378
Ramona: $30.

09:40.411 --> 09:43.514
Man: Sheriff's Department.
You're under arrest.

09:47.418 --> 09:48.953
Ramona: Let go!

09:53.124 --> 09:54.759
Ramona: Come on guys.
I didn't do anything.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.027
I did nothing wrong.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.228
Detective: Take it easy.

09:57.261 --> 09:58.463
Ramona: Come on.

09:58.496 --> 10:00.865
Detective: Where do
you think you're going?

10:00.898 --> 10:03.401
Ramona: Ow! Ow!

10:03.434 --> 10:04.168
You're hurting me.

10:04.202 --> 10:05.803
you're hurting my arm.

10:05.837 --> 10:06.704
You're hurting me.

10:06.738 --> 10:08.506
You're hurting my arm.

10:08.539 --> 10:09.540
Ow!

10:09.574 --> 10:10.742
Female cop: What's
your name, miss?

10:10.775 --> 10:12.243
Ramona: Ramona Lutz.

10:12.276 --> 10:16.447
Bully.

10:16.481 --> 10:17.615
Detective: Are you staying
at this motel?

10:17.648 --> 10:21.018
Ramona: Yeah.

10:21.052 --> 10:23.287
I never saw that before
in my life,

10:23.321 --> 10:25.590
and that's
the God's truth, sir.

10:25.623 --> 10:28.092
Female cop: You telling me this
brown residue isn't narcotics?

10:28.126 --> 10:29.727
Ramona: It doesn't
belong to me.

10:29.761 --> 10:30.995
Cop: What is that? Speed?

10:31.028 --> 10:32.330
You look like a
speedy kind of gal.

10:32.363 --> 10:33.831
Ramona: Oh, come on
officer, please.

10:33.865 --> 10:35.433
Listen to me, please.

10:35.466 --> 10:38.770
My little girl's home with me
now, and she just got out

10:38.803 --> 10:42.640
of Children's Services.
I can't afford to be
busted again

10:42.673 --> 10:44.409
because they'll take
her away from me.

10:44.442 --> 10:46.010
They'll just take my baby.

10:46.043 --> 10:48.880
Female cop: You know this pipe
constitutes probable cause?

10:48.913 --> 10:50.748
We're going to have to take a
look inside your motel room.

10:50.782 --> 10:55.153
Ramona: You can't do
that. My husband's asleep.

10:55.186 --> 10:56.854
Cop #2: Your husband know
you're out here soliciting?

10:56.888 --> 10:58.589
Ramona: Oh, give us
a fucking break.

10:58.623 --> 11:00.124
Female cop: Your husband
own a firearm, Ramona?

11:00.158 --> 11:02.393
Ramona: My Larry is on parole.

11:02.427 --> 11:05.963
He hasn't had a firearm
for a long time.

11:05.997 --> 11:07.565
Female cop: We're going to
be real unhappy if you're not

11:07.598 --> 11:08.633
telling us the truth Ramona.

11:08.666 --> 11:10.635
Ramona: I am telling
you the truth.

11:10.668 --> 11:13.638
Female cop: Okay,
come on. Let's go.

11:13.671 --> 11:16.140
Ramona: You guys are
making me wish I was dead.

11:16.174 --> 11:17.608
You fucking--

11:17.642 --> 11:20.178
(screaming)

11:20.211 --> 11:21.245
Female cop: You're going
to cut that out right now

11:21.279 --> 11:22.580
or you're going to be hogtied.

11:22.613 --> 11:23.748
Ramona: Just listen to me.

11:23.781 --> 11:25.783
Cop #1: Shut your mouth now.

11:25.817 --> 11:27.985
Not another word.

11:31.656 --> 11:33.691
(moaning)

11:36.094 --> 11:39.764
Female cop: Sheriff's
Department Larry.

11:39.797 --> 11:42.633
We need to talk to you a minute.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.302
Larry: Hey, hey what the fuck?

11:44.335 --> 11:45.870
Oh shit.

11:45.903 --> 11:48.372
Female cop: Who's
the girl Larry?

11:48.406 --> 11:50.308
Ramona: Don't take my baby away.

11:50.341 --> 11:52.009
Female cop: You diddling
the daughter Larry?

11:52.043 --> 11:53.511
Ramona: What kind
of question is that?

11:53.544 --> 11:56.013
Female cop: Get her out of here!

11:56.047 --> 11:56.981
Larry: Hey, hey, hey.

11:57.014 --> 11:58.449
Come on now.

11:58.483 --> 12:01.352
She ain't my real daughter,
and besides nothing's going on.

12:01.385 --> 12:02.587
Right?

12:02.620 --> 12:03.721
Ow! Ow!

12:03.754 --> 12:04.589
Female cop: Just who
is this man to you?

12:04.622 --> 12:06.057
Vanessa: He's my stepfather.

12:06.090 --> 12:07.425
Female cop: Take him into
the other room, and I'll talk

12:07.458 --> 12:09.127
to the juvenile alone.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.495
Larry: Ow! I got a pin in my
shoulder, and if you don't cuff

12:10.528 --> 12:12.263
me in front I swear to God
I'm going to sue the fucking

12:12.296 --> 12:15.133
police department until
there's no fucking tomorrow.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.134
You son of a bitch! Ow!

12:17.168 --> 12:18.336
Female cop: What's
your name, miss?

12:18.369 --> 12:21.472
Vanessa: Vanessa Lutz.

12:21.506 --> 12:24.075
Female cop: Well kid, I sure
don't envy your situation here.

12:24.108 --> 12:26.344
Vanessa: My parents
is just going through a
hard time is all,

12:26.377 --> 12:28.746
with the finances
and everything.

12:28.779 --> 12:32.350
Female cop: I see they
got enough money left
over to buy drugs.

12:32.383 --> 12:34.519
Vanessa: I wouldn't be
comfortable talking about

12:34.552 --> 12:39.323
that sort of thing, ma'am.

12:39.357 --> 12:40.758
Female cop: I'm going to
ask you a question, okay?

12:40.791 --> 12:42.927
Don't get upset either.
It's important.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.796
Vanessa: Okay.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.398
Female cop: Is there some sort
of sexual activity going on

12:47.431 --> 12:52.770
between your stepfather
and yourself?

12:52.803 --> 12:58.743
Larry: (laughing) Elevator up!

12:58.776 --> 13:01.279
Ramona: (laughing)
What are you laughing at?

13:01.312 --> 13:02.547
Larry: We are so fucked.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.815
Ramona: Don't take
my baby away.

13:04.849 --> 13:06.217
Oh, please!

13:06.250 --> 13:07.585
Cop: If you love her so much
how come you don't clean up

13:07.618 --> 13:09.120
around here once in a while?

13:09.153 --> 13:11.455
Ramona: I do clean up, sir.

13:11.489 --> 13:12.590
Larry: (laughing)

13:12.623 --> 13:14.258
It just happens that I'm
under a great deal of stress.

13:14.292 --> 13:16.594
My sister happened to die
three months ago in Washington,

13:16.627 --> 13:18.829
and I'm trying to
get of methadone.

13:18.863 --> 13:20.031
Cop #2: You're on methadone?

13:20.064 --> 13:22.400
Ramona: Will you please
give me a cigarette?

13:22.433 --> 13:23.935
Female cop: I told
you to keep quiet.

13:23.968 --> 13:27.004
Vanessa: Please give
her a cigarette. Please.

13:27.038 --> 13:29.941
Ramona: Are you
mad at me? Honey?

13:29.974 --> 13:32.777
Vanessa: I'm not mad, Mom.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.211
Ramona: Please, don't be mad.

13:34.245 --> 13:37.014
Come over here,
give me a big hug.

13:37.048 --> 13:38.249
Come on.

13:38.282 --> 13:39.884
I ain't going to see you
for a long time, baby.

13:39.917 --> 13:43.154
Come on.

13:43.187 --> 13:45.923
Ah, baby.

13:45.957 --> 13:48.426
I am so sorry, pooh bear.

13:48.459 --> 13:52.763
I'm so sorry.

13:52.797 --> 13:54.999
You still love me?

13:55.032 --> 13:56.400
Vanessa: I love you Momma.

13:56.434 --> 13:58.869
Ramona: I love you more.

14:02.506 --> 14:04.675
(crying)

14:04.709 --> 14:07.144
Vanessa: Here.

14:07.178 --> 14:09.914
Ramona: I love you.

14:09.947 --> 14:13.084
Larry: (laughing)

14:13.117 --> 14:16.787
Ramona: Ow! Okay, just
tell this piece of shit to get

14:16.821 --> 14:18.756
his knee out of my neck.

14:18.789 --> 14:21.525
Larry: (laughing) Bye Ramona!

14:21.559 --> 14:22.994
I love you, honey.

14:23.027 --> 14:27.064
Ramona: I love you.

14:27.098 --> 14:29.100
Ow! Ow! Ow!

14:29.133 --> 14:30.067
Female cop: Watch her head.

14:30.101 --> 14:37.074
Get her out of here.

14:37.108 --> 14:39.510
Larry: Bye, Ramona!

14:39.543 --> 14:41.345
Female cop: Children's
Services are on their way.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.547
Vanessa: Oh, that's just great.

14:43.581 --> 14:45.616
Female cop: No offense kid,
but anything's an improvement

14:45.650 --> 14:49.453
over this.

14:49.487 --> 14:50.921
What do you think we
ought to do with you?

14:50.955 --> 14:55.459
Just leave you here?

14:55.493 --> 14:58.162
Vanessa: I could stay with
you for a couple of weeks.

14:58.195 --> 14:59.330
Female cop: Are you kidding?

14:59.363 --> 15:01.065
Vanessa: No, I'm serious.

15:01.098 --> 15:02.366
I mean I can do all sorts
of chores

15:02.400 --> 15:03.668
while you was
out messing people up.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.736
Female cop: We're not allowed
to do things like that.

15:05.770 --> 15:10.041
Vanessa: You're lying.

15:10.074 --> 15:11.108
Female cop: No, I'm not.

15:11.142 --> 15:12.043
Vanessa: Yeah, you are.

15:12.076 --> 15:13.044
If you don't want to,
all you had to do

15:13.077 --> 15:15.646
was just say it straight out.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.817
Female cop: I don't want to.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.452
Vanessa: Okay, then.

15:34.398 --> 15:36.367
Hey, Mrs. Sheets.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.635
I guess you heard the news.

15:37.668 --> 15:38.836
Mrs. Sheets: Hello Vanessa.

15:38.869 --> 15:40.471
I heard you mother might
be away for a while.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.540
Vanessa: Yeah, it's her
third arrest this year.

15:42.573 --> 15:44.675
She's looking at six
months mandatory.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.544
Female cop: We're holding her
stepfather on multiple parole

15:46.577 --> 15:47.978
violations.

15:48.012 --> 15:51.115
Mrs. Sheets: Oh, I am so
sorry about all this, Vanessa.

15:51.148 --> 15:53.084
I can take over
here now, officer.

15:53.117 --> 15:54.819
Female cop: Good luck, kid.

15:54.852 --> 15:56.220
Vanessa: Yeah, right.
Come on over and ruin

15:56.253 --> 15:57.655
my life again real soon.

15:57.688 --> 16:00.157
Mrs. Sheets: You don't have
to be so hard on the officer.

16:00.191 --> 16:02.093
Vanessa: She just took my
whole family off to jail,

16:02.126 --> 16:06.364
okay?

16:06.397 --> 16:14.638
Gosh, I hate pigs
so much, Mrs. Sheets.

16:14.672 --> 16:16.407
Mrs. Sheets: Come on, now.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.143
Let's go gather up
some of your things.

16:19.176 --> 16:21.946
Vanessa: You're putting me in
foster care again, aren't you?

16:21.979 --> 16:23.614
Mrs. Sheets: I'm willing to
consider any alternative you'd

16:23.647 --> 16:26.784
like to suggest,
but I don't know.

16:26.817 --> 16:29.320
Vanessa: My Grandma
would be an alternative.

16:29.353 --> 16:31.589
Mrs. Sheets: This is the first
I've heard of any grandma.

16:31.622 --> 16:33.023
Vanessa: Yeah, on
my father's side.

16:33.057 --> 16:34.959
My real father.

16:34.992 --> 16:36.193
See.

16:36.227 --> 16:38.562
She'd take me in,
most likely.

16:38.596 --> 16:39.964
Mrs. Sheets: You
don't sound too sure.

16:39.997 --> 16:44.034
Vanessa: Actually, she
don't know about me yet.

16:44.068 --> 16:46.804
Mrs. Sheets: That's not going
to do us much good for tonight.

16:46.837 --> 16:50.307
Why haven't you been in
touch with her before now?

16:50.341 --> 16:52.076
Vanessa: Because before I was
born there was this bad blood

16:52.109 --> 16:54.812
between her and my mom, and
there must have been some harsh

16:54.845 --> 16:56.680
words spoke because my
mom was supposed

16:56.714 --> 16:58.582
to have thrown this chemical

16:58.616 --> 17:01.218
in her face that burned
her skin a little bit.

17:01.252 --> 17:02.686
Mrs. Sheets: Lovely.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.655
Vanessa: I tried to get
her on the phone once,

17:04.688 --> 17:06.924
but she ain't listed.
If I could just get up

17:06.957 --> 17:09.460
to that Stockton place,
I know I'd find her.

17:09.492 --> 17:10.728
Mrs. Sheets: Just
like that, huh?

17:10.761 --> 17:12.596
Vanessa: Yeah.

17:12.630 --> 17:15.398
Mrs. Sheets: Vanessa, Vanessa.

17:15.432 --> 17:17.935
Oh, my God.

17:17.968 --> 17:20.570
Vanessa: I know what I need.

17:20.604 --> 17:23.374
Mrs. Sheets, could you come in
here and fold up my blanket?

17:23.406 --> 17:24.842
Mrs. Sheets: This one?

17:24.875 --> 17:27.211
Vanessa: Yeah, that one.

17:27.243 --> 17:28.646
Mrs. Sheets: What in the world
do you want with this old thing.

17:28.679 --> 17:29.947
Vanessa: Oh, you know,
my momma gave it to me.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.115
Mrs. Sheets: What are you doing?

17:31.148 --> 17:34.118
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:34.151 --> 17:37.054
Vanessa: Shit! Sorry let
me get you turned around.

17:37.087 --> 17:39.423
Mrs. Sheets: Vanessa,
this is not funny.

17:39.456 --> 17:41.792
Vanessa!

17:41.826 --> 17:42.860
Vanessa: I'm not
laughing Mrs. Sheets.

17:42.893 --> 17:44.462
I promise.

17:44.495 --> 17:47.698
If you yell loud enough,
Mr. Wong will come set you free.

17:47.731 --> 17:50.868
He's the day manager. And I'll
leave the keys on top of the TV.

17:50.901 --> 17:52.236
Mrs. Sheets: Vanessa,
don't do this!

17:52.269 --> 17:53.370
You come back here!

17:53.404 --> 17:54.438
Vanessa!

17:56.974 --> 17:59.410
(mariachi music)

18:24.401 --> 18:26.704
(rock music)

18:28.205 --> 18:33.811
Vanessa: Where the
fuck are you, Chopper?

18:33.844 --> 18:36.413
Chopper: Who wants
some of this shit?

18:36.447 --> 18:39.350
Get the fuck out of here.

18:41.018 --> 18:42.319
(horn)

18:45.623 --> 18:48.192
Vanessa: Chopper!

18:48.225 --> 18:51.629
Chopper, we're fucked.
We're totally fucked.

18:51.662 --> 18:53.931
Just after you left,
the pigs came and pinched

18:53.964 --> 18:56.667
mom and Larry both.
And my parole officer showed up

18:56.700 --> 18:59.570
like a motherfucking plague
to take me to foster care again.

18:59.603 --> 19:04.174
Just like last time.

19:04.208 --> 19:07.011
Chopper: So, how
did you get here?

19:07.044 --> 19:09.947
Vanessa: I cuffed
her ankle to the bed.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.649
Chopper: That wasn't
very smart, Vanessa.

19:11.682 --> 19:14.318
Vanessa: I know. I know. I know.

19:14.351 --> 19:16.520
I'm going up north. Unless you
never want to see me again,

19:16.553 --> 19:18.422
you better get in this car
right now and come with me.

19:18.455 --> 19:21.025
Chopper: I got to be in court
next week for sentencing.

19:21.058 --> 19:28.365
If I don't show I'll get a year
at Camp Gonzales for sure.

19:28.399 --> 19:31.235
Vanessa: I guess I'm on my own.

19:31.268 --> 19:33.137
Chopper: Where up
north are you going?

19:33.170 --> 19:36.273
Vanessa: My grandma
is up in Stockton.

19:36.307 --> 19:37.308
Chopper: You got any money?

19:37.341 --> 19:39.343
Vanessa: No.

19:47.484 --> 19:50.120
Chopper: Sell that when
you get where you're going.

19:50.154 --> 19:55.225
It's from Spain.

19:55.259 --> 19:57.261
Vanessa: I love you
so much, Chopper.

19:57.294 --> 20:01.098
Chopper: I love you too, baby.

20:01.131 --> 20:08.872
Vanessa: (moaning)

20:08.906 --> 20:15.012
Chopper: (moaning)

20:20.084 --> 20:23.954
Vanessa: Here, take this.

20:30.828 --> 20:32.229
I gotta go.

20:42.606 --> 20:44.842
(rock music)

20:50.314 --> 20:53.550
Bye Chopper, my
beloved boyfriend.

21:11.035 --> 21:12.603
Man: Hey,
pinche mayate!

21:17.808 --> 21:19.843
(gunshots)

21:22.946 --> 21:26.183
Chopper: (groaning)

21:52.276 --> 21:55.045
(dramatic music)

22:26.145 --> 22:28.781
Vanessa: Fucking car!

22:28.815 --> 22:32.886
(indistinct) --my ass.

22:32.919 --> 22:36.723
Goddammit.

22:36.756 --> 22:37.957
Fuck.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.214
Bob: You having some
kind of trouble?

23:01.247 --> 23:02.482
Vanessa: Yeah, the
fucking cocksucker won't

23:02.515 --> 23:05.585
even fucking turn over.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.252
(sigh)

23:06.286 --> 23:08.721
Excuse my bad language, sir.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.124
Bob: It's all right. Mind
if I take a look at it?

23:11.157 --> 23:12.859
Vanessa: Yeah, go for it.

23:12.892 --> 23:13.893
Bob: Why don't you get
behind the wheel there

23:13.927 --> 23:16.062
and step on the gas for me.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.734
Bob: Try it.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.473
Again.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.149
Well, I hate to be the one
to break the news to you,

23:36.182 --> 23:37.917
but this car has had it.

23:37.951 --> 23:39.452
Vanessa: I knew it was
only a matter of time.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.587
Bob: Where you headed?

23:40.620 --> 23:43.056
Vanessa: My grandma
is up in Stockton.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.991
Bob: Well, I'm going
as far as L.A.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.492
You're more than welcome
to ride with me if you like.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.994
Vanessa: Really, mister?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.929
Bob: Sure. Why don't you
grab your stuff and let's go.

23:49.963 --> 23:51.230
Vanessa: Thanks!

24:19.125 --> 24:21.661
Bob: I guess we ought to
call a tow truck, huh?

24:21.694 --> 24:23.463
Vanessa: Nah, Cal Trans
will take care of it.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.698
I know my mom used to
work part time for them.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.467
So, what do I call you?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.402
Bob: I'm sorry. My
name is Bob Wolverton.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.070
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa Lutz.

24:31.104 --> 24:32.572
Bob: Nice to meet you, Vanessa.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.041
Why don't you put on your
safety belt and we'll get going.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.510
Great.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.624
Vanessa: What's this all about?

24:51.658 --> 24:54.661
Bob: It's a psychological
manual I use at my work.

24:54.694 --> 24:58.264
I'm a counselor at a school for
boys with emotional trouble.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.199
Vanessa: Just boys, huh?
No girls at all?

25:00.233 --> 25:05.638
Bob: I'm afraid so.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.140
So, how does
your family feel about

25:07.173 --> 25:08.641
this trip of yours
up to Stockton?

25:08.675 --> 25:11.577
Vanessa: I don't got no
family just at the moment.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.881
Bob: Vanessa,
everybody's got family.

25:14.914 --> 25:18.117
Vanessa: Shows
how much you know.

25:18.151 --> 25:19.786
Bob: You want to talk about it?

25:19.819 --> 25:20.987
Vanessa: Not really.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.588
Bob: I'm sorry.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.657
It's an unfortunate
habit of mine,

25:24.691 --> 25:27.193
sticking my nose in where
it doesn't really belong.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.594
Vanessa: That's a bad habit.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.130
Bob: Well, don't rub it in okay?

25:31.164 --> 25:32.799
It's just my work.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.435
I see a kid who looks
like they're in trouble

25:35.468 --> 25:37.236
and I start asking
all kinds of questions.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.572
I guess it's just
become second nature.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.974
Vanessa: It's that obvious?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.142
Bob: What is?

25:43.176 --> 25:45.178
Vanessa: Me being in trouble.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.448
Bob: Look, the offer's
still open if you want it.

25:48.481 --> 25:53.219
You know, I've always found it
amazing how, how much easier

25:53.252 --> 25:55.988
it is to really share something
with a perfect stranger.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.457
Stuff that you couldn't
even talk to with

25:57.490 --> 25:59.025
your best friend
or your family.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.593
Vanessa: Yeah, I noticed that.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.028
That's real funny, isn't it?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.029
Bob: Yeah, it is.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.630
Most of the kids
I work with, I don't even have

26:04.664 --> 26:06.566
to press them to
talk about themselves.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.668
I just let them know I'm there
and that they can talk about

26:08.701 --> 26:13.072
themselves if they want to.

26:13.106 --> 26:17.477
Vanessa: Well, I guess
my biggest problem

26:17.510 --> 26:22.715
right now is...
my mamma is in jail.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.918
Bob: Vanessa, that sounds
like a pretty bad situation.

26:25.952 --> 26:30.456
Vanessa: Yeah, that's why
I'm going to see my grandma.

26:30.490 --> 26:34.560
Bob: You mind me asking
why your mother's in jail?

26:34.594 --> 26:35.995
Vanessa: It's
pretty embarrassing.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.430
Bob: Vanessa, why would you
be embarrassed

26:37.463 --> 26:38.998
about another person's act?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.666
Vanessa: I don't know.
It's just--

26:40.700 --> 26:44.270
I don't feel comfortable
talking about stuff like that.

26:44.303 --> 26:49.242
I think it makes me look
like a low-type person.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.611
Bob: I can understand that.

26:51.644 --> 26:52.578
You know, most of
the boys I work with,

26:52.612 --> 26:55.281
even the most troubled ones,

26:55.314 --> 26:59.452
all they really need is just
someone to listen to them.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.187
Vanessa: Yeah, but you
probably get so sick of hearing

27:01.220 --> 27:04.257
them sad stories
day in and day out.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.525
Bob: I don't.

27:05.558 --> 27:06.859
I really love my work.

27:06.893 --> 27:07.894
I really do.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.996
I couldn't imagine myself
doing anything else.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.364
Not ever.

27:17.336 --> 27:21.307
Vanessa: I guess I wouldn't
mind talking to someone.

27:21.340 --> 27:25.545
Just wouldn't know
where to begin.

27:25.578 --> 27:27.280
Bob: Why don't you
begin with your mother.

27:27.313 --> 27:31.317
I mean, if you want to.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.320
Vanessa: My mamma's
a whore. (crying)

27:41.260 --> 27:44.030
Thanks, mister.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.699
I mean, Bob.

27:46.732 --> 27:50.069
Bob: There.

27:50.102 --> 27:55.007
Vanessa: I can't believe I'm
telling you all this stuff.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.977
My mamma's in jail.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.079
It looks like my
stepfather's next parole officer

28:00.112 --> 28:03.749
ain't even been born yet.

28:03.783 --> 28:07.286
Bob: Vanessa, you really
don't have anyone, do you?

28:07.320 --> 28:14.861
That's terrible.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.530
Oh, that's just terrible.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.699
Vanessa: My real dad was this
merchant Marine out in Texas,

28:19.732 --> 28:23.269
but he got stabbed to death
on one of them container ships

28:23.302 --> 28:27.707
by this man from Pakistan,
before I was born.

28:27.740 --> 28:28.941
You want to see his picture?

28:28.975 --> 28:30.009
I got it right here.

28:30.042 --> 28:34.413
Bob: Absolutely.

28:34.447 --> 28:39.085
That's my daddy.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.553
Bob: He looks very interesting.

28:40.586 --> 28:41.888
Vanessa: You think?

28:41.921 --> 28:43.422
Bob: Absolutely.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.491
Vanessa: I think so, too.

28:45.525 --> 28:47.226
Bob: Vanessa, your grandmother
is going to be very proud when

28:47.260 --> 28:51.297
she finds out what a wonderful
granddaughter she's got.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.699
But I have to be
honest with you.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.035
I think given your
present situation,

28:56.068 --> 28:59.438
maybe foster care would be
the way you should go right now.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.107
Vanessa: Oh Bob. You don't know.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.109
You know, sometimes them places
are okay. But most of the time,

29:03.142 --> 29:05.244
them people are just in it for
the check that the state sends

29:05.278 --> 29:07.146
for your upkeep.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.315
Bob: I take it you've
had some bad experiences?

29:09.348 --> 29:11.450
Vanessa: The last one I was in,
there was this old man there

29:11.484 --> 29:15.054
that everyone called Grandpa
and he had this disease called

29:15.087 --> 29:17.323
"Wiesenheimer's"--
I think it was--

29:17.356 --> 29:22.828
where your brain cells
run out into your pee.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.864
Bob: Yes, it's a
form of senility.

29:24.897 --> 29:25.598
Waitress: Here's your check sir.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.199
Bob: Thank you.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.501
Vanessa: Thanks, Bob.

29:28.534 --> 29:33.739
That's the best fucking
dinner I've had all month.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.141
Bob: Wouldn't mind stretching
my legs for a little while

29:35.174 --> 29:36.409
before I got behind the wheel.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.276
Do you mind?

29:37.310 --> 29:39.745
Vanessa: (burps) No, sure.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.514
I got all the time in the world.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.883
Bob: Great.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.718
Vanessa: So, them foster
parents, the Morales,

29:45.751 --> 29:46.986
I mean you would have

29:47.019 --> 29:49.455
thought a check from the state
would've been enough, but no.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.458
They figured on me helping
out with Grandpa, too.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.493
Bob: You mean, you actually had
to provide care for this man?

29:54.527 --> 29:56.128
Vanessa: Get crucial.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.097
This guy was pissing his
sheets nearly every night.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.968
Just being near him made me
want to puke my guts out.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.337
Bob: So, what happened
when you refused?

30:04.370 --> 30:05.538
Vanessa: They just
started treating me

30:05.571 --> 30:08.975
like I was the biggest
bitch who'd ever been born.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.676
And this one night,
just a couple of weeks after

30:10.710 --> 30:13.579
I'd been placed there,
I woke up to see Grandpa

30:13.612 --> 30:15.748
standing over me with
his cane in one hand

30:15.781 --> 30:18.351
and his you know
what in the other.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.086
Bob: My God! What happened?

30:20.119 --> 30:22.221
Vanessa: I told him
to get the hell out.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.823
Bob: I take it he didn't.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.524
Vanessa: Nah, that's
when he tried to slip in

30:25.558 --> 30:27.226
in under the covers
with me.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.695
I just went crazy on him.

30:29.729 --> 30:32.665
Bob: What do you mean,
you went crazy?

30:32.698 --> 30:34.700
Vanessa: I was pissed off
because I couldn't see my mom

30:34.734 --> 30:36.435
and just having this perv
standing over me

30:36.469 --> 30:40.006
wagging his thing in my face
was just like the last straw.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.074
Bob: So what did you do?

30:42.108 --> 30:44.844
Vanessa: Well, got up
on my knees and just

30:44.877 --> 30:48.114
slapped his dentures half
out of his face.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.383
Then I dropped down on his chest
and just started wailing on him,

30:50.416 --> 30:52.852
beating him up so hard.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.154
Swearing so loud.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.622
Bob: My God.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.190
Vanessa: Yeah. So then, the
lights went on and Mr. Morales

30:58.224 --> 30:59.625
showed up in his pajamas.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.260
Bob: Well, thank
God he was there.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.596
Vanessa: Yeah, right.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.432
He hit me so hard I had to
have my jaw wired shut

31:06.465 --> 31:09.435
for nearly three months.
Broke my nose too.

31:09.468 --> 31:10.670
That's how come it's so big.

31:10.703 --> 31:19.011
Bob: Vanessa, your
nose is not big.

31:19.045 --> 31:23.816
Vanessa: It's pretty damn big.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.651
Bob: Was this man ever punished?

31:25.684 --> 31:27.453
Vanessa: Are you kidding?

31:27.486 --> 31:32.124
A pillar of society
like Mr. Morales? Nah.

31:32.158 --> 31:33.726
But my mom got out of rehab
a couple of days later,

31:33.759 --> 31:36.929
so I didn't have to go back
or nothing.

31:36.962 --> 31:40.699
Bob: You were telling me a while
ago your step-dad was on parole.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.102
Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.304
Larry's been in lots of pens.

31:45.337 --> 31:49.475
Like this one federal place
up in Illinois, Marion.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.044
It's mostly for drug shit.

31:52.078 --> 31:56.515
Manufacturing methamphetamines,
stolen property.

31:56.549 --> 31:59.418
Nothing real, real bad.

31:59.452 --> 32:05.758
Bob: Vanessa, please don't be
offended by my next question.

32:05.791 --> 32:13.365
But, um, did your
stepfather molest you?

32:13.399 --> 32:15.701
Vanessa: Oh, my God.

32:15.734 --> 32:20.106
You know, this lady police woman
just asked me that very same

32:20.139 --> 32:23.776
question just a few hours ago.

32:23.809 --> 32:26.479
Bob: And how did
that make you feel?

32:26.512 --> 32:30.983
Vanessa: Like I got daddy's fuck
hole tattooed on my forehead.

32:31.016 --> 32:35.654
Bob: Maybe this is an
issue you should explore?

32:35.688 --> 32:38.657
Vanessa: I never even told
my fiancÃ© about this stuff.

32:38.691 --> 32:41.160
Bob: Vanessa, if you
keep something like this
bottled up inside,

32:41.193 --> 32:45.397
it could wreck your whole life.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.099
Vanessa: Now you're scaring me.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.502
Bob: It's not my intention.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.670
I just think you have
a very good opportunity
now to get through

32:51.704 --> 32:53.939
some of the trauma and anguish
you've been suffering from

32:53.973 --> 32:56.942
for such a long time.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.411
Vanessa: I do got trauma, huh?

32:59.445 --> 33:04.049
Bob: Let's not kid
ourselves, Vanessa.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.951
Vanessa: I've been so anguished,

33:05.985 --> 33:08.787
I can't even
remember being happy.

33:08.821 --> 33:12.358
Bob: Vanessa, you have to
look this pain in the eye.

33:12.391 --> 33:16.362
Otherwise, it could rule over
every aspect of your life.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.330
Now, I think I can help you,

33:18.364 --> 33:21.934
but you're going
to have to trust me.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.770
You're going to
have to let me in.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.844
My God you're cold.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.946
Vanessa: Just thinking about
my fucked up life is all.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.791
Bob: Let's go.

33:45.824 --> 33:48.827
Vanessa: (crying) I'm sorry.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.430
Here I'm blubbering like a big
old baby, and you're just trying

33:51.463 --> 33:52.865
to help me.

33:52.898 --> 33:56.202
Bob: Vanessa, Vanessa,
just take your time.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.804
Take your time.

34:06.779 --> 34:12.318
Vanessa: I was 11 when
Larry first hit on me.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.253
Bob: Where was your mother?

34:14.286 --> 34:19.592
Vanessa: Some stupid
halfway house.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.795
Bob: How did the abuse begin?

34:22.828 --> 34:24.797
Vanessa: With my mamma gone,
I had all these extra chores

34:24.830 --> 34:30.002
I had to do, like the
laundry, the groceries
and things like that.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.871
Bob: So, in effect you became
the woman of the house.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.005
Vanessa: Yeah.

34:34.039 --> 34:39.745
Yeah. I was so proud of myself.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.614
And then this one night,
we was watching TV after dinner,

34:42.648 --> 34:47.553
like we always do, and that's
when Larry told me

34:47.585 --> 34:55.094
one of mamma's chores
had always been to massage
his you know what.

34:55.127 --> 34:57.663
Bob: Did Larry expose
himself to you?

34:57.696 --> 35:00.933
Vanessa: All through the show.

35:00.966 --> 35:03.669
Bob: Did Larry have an erection?

35:03.702 --> 35:07.506
Vanessa: That's
putting it mildly.

35:07.539 --> 35:11.043
Bob: Did he ask you to
perform oral sex for him?

35:11.076 --> 35:15.247
Vanessa: At first, I mean,
he just had me hold on to
his you know what

35:15.281 --> 35:19.151
during whatever
happened to be on TV.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.086
He didn't get around to the
other thing you just mentioned

35:21.120 --> 35:25.057
for a while.

35:25.090 --> 35:27.559
I guess he figured if he went
all slow I wouldn't freak out

35:27.593 --> 35:30.329
and get him in trouble.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.565
But back then I didn't
know that stuff we was
doing was criminal.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.768
Bob: Vanessa, victims
often blame themselves.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.369
It's a common occurrence.

35:37.403 --> 35:38.637
Make no mistake about it.

35:38.671 --> 35:42.007
You are the victim.

35:42.041 --> 35:43.075
Vanessa: Really, Bob?

35:43.108 --> 35:45.377
Bob: Absolutely.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.012
Vanessa: I was such a baby
back then I didn't even know

35:47.046 --> 35:50.049
why men wanted all that stuff
done to them in the first place.

35:50.082 --> 35:52.885
Bob: Vanessa, my God,
you were a child.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.087
You must have been so confused.

35:55.120 --> 36:00.159
Vanessa: And when he did that
thing that you mentioned

36:00.192 --> 36:04.363
for the first time, I swear to
Christ I thought he was going

36:04.396 --> 36:07.399
to the bathroom in my mouth.

36:12.604 --> 36:18.444
Bob: Vanessa, do I have
your absolute trust?

36:18.477 --> 36:21.180
Vanessa: I guess I trust
you more than I've ever
trusted anyone

36:21.213 --> 36:25.918
in my whole life, Bob.
And I really mean that.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.619
Bob: Thank you.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.588
The reason why I'm asking
is this very powerful new

36:29.621 --> 36:33.092
psychological technique
that I'd like to try on you.

36:33.125 --> 36:35.327
I think it could
really help you.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.496
What do you think? Would
you like to give it a try?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.264
Vanessa: Yeah. Sure.

36:39.298 --> 36:42.000
Bob: Okay. It consists of
a battery of questions
that are designed

36:42.034 --> 36:45.070
to trigger certain elements
of your subconscious.

36:45.104 --> 36:47.206
I've got to warn you, Vanessa.

36:47.239 --> 36:51.110
This technique...
it can be uncomfortable.

36:51.143 --> 36:52.611
Vanessa: Go for it, Bob.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.381
I mean, if you think
it's going to help me.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.649
Bob: Okay, okay.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.619
Let's get started.
Are you ready?

37:00.652 --> 37:02.321
Vanessa: Mm-hmm.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.889
Bob: A few moments ago,
you were telling me that

37:03.922 --> 37:06.759
you felt like Larry had gone
to the bathroom in your mouth.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.027
Those were your exact words.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.495
Do you remember?

37:09.528 --> 37:12.865
Now at that exact moment when
Larry ejaculated in your mouth,

37:12.898 --> 37:14.700
did you feel as though somehow
you were being transformed

37:14.733 --> 37:18.404
into some kind of
a human urinal?

37:18.437 --> 37:20.873
Vanessa: What kind of fucking
questions are these, Bob?

37:20.906 --> 37:22.541
Bob: Vanessa, you have to answer
with the first thing that comes

37:22.574 --> 37:23.942
into your mind.

37:23.976 --> 37:26.111
It's very important.

37:26.145 --> 37:28.080
Vanessa: I knew I
was flesh and blood.

37:28.113 --> 37:30.049
Bob: I understand that,
but you have to tell me

37:30.082 --> 37:31.850
exactly how you felt.

37:31.884 --> 37:39.691
You have to learn how to
express your feelings out loud.

37:39.725 --> 37:45.731
Vanessa: I felt
just like you said.

37:45.764 --> 37:51.770
Bob: Say it out loud Vanessa.

37:51.804 --> 37:58.043
Vanessa: I felt like I had been
transformed into a human urinal.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.813
(crying)

38:07.152 --> 38:09.455
Bob: That's very good, Vanessa.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.024
Very good.

38:12.057 --> 38:15.394
Now tell me this, and this
is absolutely crucial.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.129
Are you ready?

38:17.162 --> 38:21.233
Vanessa: Mm-hmm.

38:21.266 --> 38:27.239
Bob: Vanessa, did
Larry try to fuck you?

38:27.272 --> 38:31.310
Vanessa: Oh God.
He tried... later on.

38:31.343 --> 38:41.253
Bob: Vanessa. Did you like
it when Larry fucked you?

38:41.286 --> 38:42.988
Vanessa: You piece of shit.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.558
Bob: Vanessa, I told you this
can get very uncomfortable.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.960
Vanessa: Pull over right now.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.061
Bob: We're not finished, yet.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.462
Vanessa: Oh yes, we are.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.831
We are definitely finished.
Now you pull on over.

38:52.865 --> 38:55.767
Bob: You can suffer
irreparable damage if
you break it off like this.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.469
Vanessa: I don't give a goddamn.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.805
Bob: Jesus Christ.
Son of a bitch.

38:59.838 --> 39:03.208
Jesus Christ.

39:03.242 --> 39:04.810
Vanessa: Where's
the door handle?

39:04.843 --> 39:06.478
Bob: You looking for this?

39:06.512 --> 39:07.579
(slap)

39:07.613 --> 39:08.413
Vanessa: (screams)

39:08.447 --> 39:09.481
Bob: You just settle down.

39:09.515 --> 39:10.816
Vanessa: I'm going to kill you.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.484
Bob: I'm going to slit
your throat right now.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.019
Is that what you want
me to fucking do?

39:14.052 --> 39:16.388
Vanessa: Okay, okay.
I'm stopping, okay?

39:16.421 --> 39:17.990
Bob: Now you get down there
on the floor and you get my

39:18.023 --> 39:21.727
fucking car keys and you
put them in the ignition.

39:21.760 --> 39:25.564
Vanessa: You wouldn't like it if
someone was doing that to you.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.199
Bob: Well, you're
probably right, Vanessa.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.268
I doubt I would like it if
someone was doing this to me.

39:29.301 --> 39:30.536
Vanessa: Well, then stop it.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.138
Bob: I will stop it if
you promise to behave.

39:33.172 --> 39:39.144
Vanessa: I promise I'll behave.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.812
Are you that guy on the news?

39:40.846 --> 39:42.281
Bob: I'm sorry?

39:42.314 --> 39:44.216
Vanessa: You the guy that's
been killing all them girls

39:44.249 --> 39:45.517
on the freeway, Bob?

39:45.551 --> 39:47.753
Bob: (laughing)

39:47.786 --> 39:49.655
Vanessa: Why you killing
all them girls, Bob?

39:49.688 --> 39:50.822
Bob: Because I've
absolutely reached my

39:50.856 --> 39:53.192
fucking limit with
people like you, Vanessa.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.927
Vanessa: What kind of
people am I supposed to be?

39:54.960 --> 39:59.298
Bob: Alcoholics,
drug addicts, fathers
who fuck their daughters,

39:59.331 --> 40:01.733
the drug addicted motherfucking
whores with their bastards

40:01.767 --> 40:02.868
fucking offspring.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.369
Vanessa: Hey, I
ain't no trick baby.

40:04.403 --> 40:08.273
Bob: Vanessa, I call them
garbage people, and I assure you

40:08.307 --> 40:09.541
you are one of them.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.642
Vanessa: I am not.

40:10.676 --> 40:12.010
Bob: Look at you.

40:12.044 --> 40:14.479
You're already a master at
the manipulation of men.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.181
Vanessa: I didn't
run nothing on you.

40:16.214 --> 40:17.749
Bob: It's so intrinsic
to your fucking nature

40:17.783 --> 40:19.651
you are not even aware
of it when you do it.

40:19.685 --> 40:25.023
Stupid bitch.

40:27.326 --> 40:29.962
(dramatic music)

40:33.532 --> 40:35.334
Vanessa: So what, you think
it's okay to do all sorts

40:35.367 --> 40:36.735
of bad stuff to me now?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.904
Bob: Well, that's an open-ended
discussion, Vanessa,

40:38.937 --> 40:41.506
dealing with deep
philosophical ramifications.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.308
Something you
could hardly grasp.

40:43.342 --> 40:45.277
In fact, take it from me, a
professional, Vanessa,

40:45.310 --> 40:48.246
you're an absolute
fucking moron.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.049
Vanessa: Maybe I ain't smart
like you, and maybe I haven't

40:51.083 --> 40:55.053
finished school, but at least
I ain't a fucking hypocrite.

40:55.087 --> 40:57.189
Bob: (laughing) Vanessa,
please indulge me.

40:57.222 --> 41:00.325
Tell me why I am a hypocrite.

41:00.359 --> 41:02.527
Vanessa: You act like you's all
on some sort of mission,

41:02.561 --> 41:09.668
but all you want to
do is just get off in
a sex type way.

41:09.701 --> 41:12.437
Are you going to
do sex to me now?

41:12.471 --> 41:17.075
Bob: I promise you if
we get really, really intimate

41:17.109 --> 41:21.713
you're going to be way
past being offended.

41:21.747 --> 41:24.516
Vanessa: What? Are you going
to fuck me when I'm dead?

41:24.549 --> 41:27.286
Bob: (laughing)

41:27.319 --> 41:28.987
Vanessa: Mister, I'm a person.

41:29.021 --> 41:31.089
I'm a human being.

41:31.123 --> 41:33.158
Bob: Yeah, like that drug
addict fucking whore of a mother

41:33.191 --> 41:34.693
of yours?

41:34.726 --> 41:36.561
Vanessa: Well, I sure wouldn't
want to meet your mom, Bob.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.963
(punch)

41:37.996 --> 41:39.498
(whimpering)

41:39.531 --> 41:42.200
What? You can talk about my mom,
but I can't talk about yours?

41:42.234 --> 41:45.137
Bob: We are not here to
talk about me, Vanessa.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.572
We are here to talk about you.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.775
So, get your fucking pants down.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.343
Vanessa: Please,
just let me go Bob.

41:51.376 --> 41:52.778
Bob: Goddammit! (punch)

41:52.811 --> 41:56.181
Get your fucking pants down,
you fucking cunt.

41:56.214 --> 41:58.016
Vanessa: What'd you call me?

41:58.050 --> 42:00.652
Bob: I said get your
fucking pants down, now.

42:00.686 --> 42:03.188
Vanessa: Okay! Okay!

42:03.221 --> 42:05.991
Look, I got these boots and I
got all them laces and stuff,

42:06.024 --> 42:07.926
so you're going to have
to give me a minute.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.094
Bob: Hurry up.

42:13.065 --> 42:14.099
(scream)

42:14.766 --> 42:16.068
Bob: Oh, fuck!

42:16.101 --> 42:17.803
Fucking bitch!

42:17.836 --> 42:20.338
I'm going to fucking
kill you, Vanessa.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.274
Vanessa: You just
settle down, Bob.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.209
Bob: You just settle
down right now.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.744
Bob: Okay. Okay.

42:25.777 --> 42:27.646
Vanessa: Drop that
razor out the window.

42:27.679 --> 42:33.752
If you try anything I'm going
to shoot you so many times.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.520
You know you should have
just let me out of the car

42:35.554 --> 42:38.023
when I asked you to, Bob.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.658
You see where bad
manners get you?

42:39.691 --> 42:40.792
You see?

42:40.826 --> 42:42.728
Bob: Listen Vanessa,
look I just--

42:42.761 --> 42:44.896
Vanessa: Look, I've heard all
I'm going to hear out of you.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.765
Bob: Ah, fuck.

42:46.798 --> 42:48.900
Vanessa: So, there.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.635
Bob: Ah, Jesus Christ!

42:50.669 --> 42:52.237
Vanessa: And that's for
tricking me into telling
you all them things

42:52.270 --> 42:55.373
I never even told my fiancÃ©.

42:55.407 --> 42:58.477
Bob: Ah, Jesus Christ, we're
going to get into an accident!

42:58.510 --> 43:01.713
Vanessa: That's for cutting off
all my hair, you fucker.

43:01.747 --> 43:02.514
Bob: Vanessa, look,
you're upset.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.382
Okay. You have
every right to be.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.685
Look, something dark and
terrible came over me.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.954
I don't know what,
but I swear to you I
wasn't going to hurt you.

43:08.987 --> 43:10.322
You've got to believe that.

43:10.355 --> 43:12.324
Vanessa: Oh, yeah
right. I'm so sure.

43:12.357 --> 43:14.159
Bob: I'm serious. I just
wanted to scare you.

43:14.192 --> 43:15.894
I don't even know why.

43:15.927 --> 43:20.499
Look, it's obvious to me now
I'm a profoundly sick man.

43:20.532 --> 43:22.534
Vanessa: Yeah, well I
won't argue with you there.

43:22.567 --> 43:26.037
Anyone who'd do sex to a
dead person is definitely sick.

43:26.071 --> 43:28.874
Bob: Well, you see?
You just admitted there.

43:28.907 --> 43:30.142
I'm a sick man.
You can't hit a--

43:30.175 --> 43:32.010
Vanessa: Shut up!
Shut up!

43:32.043 --> 43:37.249
Bob: Okay, okay, okay.

43:37.282 --> 43:43.121
Son of a bitch.

43:43.155 --> 43:46.491
Vanessa, what are you
thinking right now?

43:46.525 --> 43:48.293
Vanessa: What? You want to
hear more of my innermost

43:48.326 --> 43:49.327
fucking secrets?

43:49.361 --> 43:50.362
Bob: No.

43:50.395 --> 43:51.930
Vanessa: Fucking asshole.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.032
Bob: No, I was just wondering
what you were planning on doing.

43:54.065 --> 43:55.967
Vanessa: I'm going to turn
you in to the fucking pigs.

43:56.001 --> 44:00.205
That's what I'm going to do.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.575
Bob: Well, you know what
will happen then, don't you?

44:03.608 --> 44:07.813
Vanessa: Yeah, you'll end up
sucking gas at San Quentin.

44:07.846 --> 44:08.914
Bob: Vanessa--

44:08.947 --> 44:10.749
Vanessa: You just might.

44:10.782 --> 44:15.353
Bob: Vanessa, people like me,
we don't go to the gas chamber.

44:15.387 --> 44:17.055
Vanessa: Then you'll go to the
penitentiary where the mighty

44:17.088 --> 44:20.192
Aryan brotherhood will make
you wish you'd never been born.

44:20.225 --> 44:22.027
Bob: Vanessa, the likelihood
of someone like me

44:22.060 --> 44:25.330
going to prison
is absolutely nil.

44:25.363 --> 44:27.032
Vanessa: Well, you think they're
just going to let you walk?

44:27.065 --> 44:30.802
Bob: It will be like that time
Mr. Morales broke your jaw.

44:30.836 --> 44:32.671
Vanessa: You think so, huh?

44:32.704 --> 44:34.739
Bob: Absolutely.

44:34.773 --> 44:35.907
They won't take me for a killer.

44:35.941 --> 44:37.909
They'll let me go free.

44:37.943 --> 44:40.245
They'll send you to
some new foster home.

44:40.278 --> 44:42.347
Probably make Mr. Morales'
place look like some pleasant

44:42.380 --> 44:45.784
dream to you.

44:45.817 --> 44:47.185
Unless, of course,
you want to play it

44:47.219 --> 44:50.555
smart for the first time
in your life.

44:50.589 --> 44:53.358
Vanessa: How do I go
about doing that, Bob?

44:53.391 --> 44:56.161
Bob: I got some money on
me. I got an ATM card.

44:56.194 --> 45:00.065
We can go get some more, you
go your way. I'll go mine.

45:00.098 --> 45:04.069
I swear to God you'll
never see or hear me again.

45:04.102 --> 45:07.372
What do you say?

45:07.405 --> 45:10.141
Vanessa: I say turn off
on that exit up there.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.410
Bob: Jesus Christ, Vanessa.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

45:12.444 --> 45:15.180
Vanessa: You want to get
shot a whole bunch of times?

45:15.213 --> 45:18.617
Now do like I tell you,
dumb-ass.

45:18.650 --> 45:20.385
Bob: Okay. Okay I'm turning.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.954
Vanessa: You think
this is a game?

45:35.300 --> 45:36.768
Bob: What are we going
to do, drive around for three

45:36.801 --> 45:39.738
or four hours looking for a cop?

45:39.771 --> 45:43.208
Vanessa: Keep flapping
your gums. Who cares,
if no one is listening.

45:43.241 --> 45:45.343
Pull up on that dirt
road over there.

46:04.029 --> 46:06.197
Now Bob, I know there's a lot
of sick guys out there that get

46:06.231 --> 46:08.466
all hard thinking
about messing women up.

46:08.500 --> 46:13.171
I mean, hell, that's all
you ever see on TV.

46:13.204 --> 46:15.073
But when a guy goes and
does that stuff for real,

46:15.106 --> 46:16.708
like you was planning
on doing to me tonight--

46:16.741 --> 46:18.143
Bob: Vanessa, I was just
trying to scare you.

46:18.176 --> 46:20.912
Vanessa: You had
your turn to talk.

46:20.946 --> 46:22.881
Okay, I think it's only fair
to let me get my two cents in.

46:22.914 --> 46:24.549
Bob: You're absolutely
right. I'm sorry.

46:24.583 --> 46:27.652
Please, go on.

46:27.686 --> 46:30.722
Vanessa: When a guy hurts
someone who never hurt them,

46:30.755 --> 46:34.592
it makes him a criminal
first and a sick guy second.

46:34.626 --> 46:38.296
Being sick has to take second
place to being crooked.

46:38.330 --> 46:40.598
And Bob, you're crooked.

46:40.632 --> 46:41.733
Bob: (crying)

46:41.766 --> 46:43.635
Vanessa: You proved
that to me tonight.

46:43.668 --> 46:45.070
Am I making any sense?

46:45.103 --> 46:47.605
Bob: (crying) Yes, there's
so much I want to tell you.

46:47.639 --> 46:48.873
Vanessa: Bob--

46:48.907 --> 46:50.642
Bob: Look, there's so much more
to me than what you saw tonight.

46:50.675 --> 46:51.843
Vanessa: Bob!

46:51.876 --> 46:53.445
Bob!

46:53.478 --> 46:54.612
Bob: Please. (crying)

46:54.646 --> 46:58.650
Vanessa: Time for
talk is over, now.

46:58.683 --> 47:00.952
I'm going to ask you a question
and it's real, real important,

47:00.986 --> 47:02.487
okay?

47:02.520 --> 47:05.256
Bob: What?

47:05.290 --> 47:08.126
Vanessa: Do you accept Jesus
Christ as your Lord and Savior?

47:08.159 --> 47:09.761
Bob: Oh, my God.

47:09.794 --> 47:11.830
Vanessa, you're
really scaring me.

47:11.863 --> 47:13.031
Vanessa: Tell me now, Bob.

47:13.064 --> 47:16.534
I need to know.

47:16.568 --> 47:21.006
Do you believe Jesus Christ is
your Lord and personal Savior?

47:21.039 --> 47:23.808
Bob: Yes, I do. I swear.

47:23.842 --> 47:26.811
Vanessa: Good.
That's really good.

47:26.845 --> 47:28.580
Bob: (crying)

47:28.613 --> 47:30.081
(gunshot)

47:49.567 --> 47:51.736
-Vanessa: (screaming)
-Bob: (groaning)

48:17.362 --> 48:19.197
Bob: Oh God. Not like this.

48:19.230 --> 48:20.965
(screaming)

48:21.566 --> 48:23.334
(gunshots)

48:32.644 --> 48:34.012
(gunshot)

48:40.852 --> 48:42.153
(vomiting)

48:51.296 --> 48:55.333
Vanessa: Oh God. Dear God,
that was so fucking bad,

48:55.366 --> 49:00.605
but I was at a loss,
so I left it up to you.

49:00.638 --> 49:02.841
I love you with all my heart
and I hope you don't hate me

49:02.874 --> 49:06.511
more than you already do.

49:06.544 --> 49:09.447
Please bless Mamma,
Larry and Chopper.

49:09.481 --> 49:10.648
Amen.

50:11.976 --> 50:15.046
(country music)

50:36.367 --> 50:42.507
I think I'll have the double
Heman breakfast and

50:42.540 --> 50:47.812
a large sized cherry cola.
Okay?

50:47.846 --> 50:52.116
What?

50:52.150 --> 50:54.085
I must look a fright.

50:54.118 --> 50:57.155
Got a washroom?

51:26.184 --> 51:28.620
Nurse: Just one moment, please.

51:30.421 --> 51:31.623
(crash)

51:32.824 --> 51:34.392
Bob: Please.

51:34.425 --> 51:37.795
Please, help me.

51:37.829 --> 51:42.734
Call my wife, please.

51:46.771 --> 51:48.139
(thud)

51:51.509 --> 51:53.878
Vanessa: Hey officer, what's up?

51:53.911 --> 51:55.546
Police officer: Let's go.

51:55.580 --> 51:56.648
Come on.

51:56.681 --> 51:57.715
Vanessa: Sir, I
did nothing wrong.

51:57.749 --> 51:59.651
I did nothing wrong!

51:59.684 --> 52:01.386
Police officer: We've got
a gun. We've got a gun.

52:01.419 --> 52:04.289
Vanessa: Big wow.

52:04.322 --> 52:06.758
God, you know half the
goddamn world's got a gun,

52:06.791 --> 52:08.359
and you're going to throw me
in the back of this--

52:08.393 --> 52:11.229
Cop: Enough!

52:11.262 --> 52:13.231
Vanessa: Give me
a goddamn break.

52:13.264 --> 52:16.901
What, you're not even going to
speak to me mister, oink man?

52:16.934 --> 52:18.369
(snorts)

52:18.403 --> 52:19.370
I bet you like--

52:19.404 --> 52:23.508
Cop: Backing up.

52:23.541 --> 52:25.276
Doctor: Mr. Wolverton.

52:25.310 --> 52:27.245
Mr. Wolverton.

52:27.278 --> 52:29.514
Mr. Wolverton has learned that
he's going to have to undergo

52:29.547 --> 52:31.082
a radical colectomy.

52:31.115 --> 52:33.785
-Garnett: That's awful.
-Mike: Yeah!

52:33.818 --> 52:35.086
Bob: Oh, please no!

52:35.119 --> 52:36.721
Doctor: There's a couple of
detectives here from the

52:36.754 --> 52:39.724
Sheriff's Department that
need to speak with you.

52:39.757 --> 52:42.994
Bob: (crying)

52:43.027 --> 52:45.530
Garnett: Mr. Wolverton,
Mr. Wolverton.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.265
Mr. Wolverton, can you hear me?

52:47.298 --> 52:50.134
I'm Garnett Wallace,
from the Sheriff's Department.

52:50.168 --> 52:53.571
I know you're in a lot of pain,
but can you take a moment?

52:53.604 --> 52:55.340
I want to show you
a photograph.

52:55.373 --> 52:57.975
Tell me if this is the
person that shot you.

52:58.009 --> 53:00.645
Is this the person
that shot you?

53:00.678 --> 53:02.680
Bob: (crying) Yes.

53:02.714 --> 53:07.652
Garnett: Are you sure this
is the person that shot you?

53:07.685 --> 53:09.554
Okay, you'll be all right.

53:14.959 --> 53:18.229
Bob: (crying)

53:18.262 --> 53:19.364
Garnett: Mrs. Wolverton,
your husband gave

53:19.397 --> 53:21.466
a positive identification.

53:21.499 --> 53:23.067
Mimi: What happens now?

53:23.101 --> 53:28.473
Garnett: Well, you have to keep
in mind this is a juvenile we're

53:28.506 --> 53:29.273
talking about.

53:29.307 --> 53:29.340
Mimi: What?

53:30.575 --> 53:31.943
Are you telling me you're
just going to let her go free?

53:31.976 --> 53:34.145
Garnett: I didn't say we're
going to let her go free.

53:34.178 --> 53:36.047
She can be incarcerated
up to the age of 25.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.248
Mimi: For that?

53:37.281 --> 53:39.417
Look at him. Ten years?

53:39.450 --> 53:42.520
My husband is in there with
God knows how many bullets

53:42.553 --> 53:44.722
in his head, and in his back.

53:44.756 --> 53:49.093
She deliberately shot him
over and over and over again.

53:49.127 --> 53:51.362
I want her held responsible.

53:51.396 --> 53:54.031
Mike: Mrs. Wolverton,
I assure you that

53:54.065 --> 53:56.367
whoever did this isn't just
going to walk away.

53:56.401 --> 53:57.969
Mimi: What if he dies, huh?

53:58.002 --> 54:00.104
If he dies, I think she should
be put in the electric chair.

54:00.138 --> 54:01.139
Mike: Gas.

54:01.172 --> 54:01.939
Mimi: What?

54:01.973 --> 54:04.442
Mike: They use
gas in California.

54:04.475 --> 54:06.978
Mimi: I think you know
what I mean, detective.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.446
I certainly hope that
the people that are

54:08.479 --> 54:12.016
responsible for prosecuting
this case can muster

54:12.049 --> 54:14.018
just a little bit more
sensitivity to the rights

54:14.051 --> 54:15.753
of the victims than
you appear to have.

54:15.787 --> 54:17.455
Mike: I didn't mean
to sound uncaring.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.056
Mimi: I want that little
monster to pay for this.

54:19.090 --> 54:23.561
For me, for my husband, for
the next person out there that

54:23.594 --> 54:26.297
she'll end up hurting or killing
if God forbid she's allowed back

54:26.330 --> 54:28.766
on the streets again.

54:40.947 --> 54:44.250
Garnett: Vanessa Lutz.

54:44.283 --> 54:46.919
My name is Garnett Wallace and
this is my partner Mike Breer.

54:46.953 --> 54:50.022
We're with the
Sheriff's Department.

54:50.056 --> 54:52.625
Vanessa: You're that
guy on TV aren't you?

54:52.658 --> 54:55.061
Garnett: Mm-hmm.

54:55.094 --> 54:57.997
I'm investigating
the I-5 murders.

54:58.030 --> 55:00.132
Vanessa: Well y'all can all just
take a big old fucking cruise

55:00.166 --> 55:03.102
because I took full out
care of that piece of shit.

55:03.135 --> 55:06.939
Mike: Mr. Wolverton is
in critical condition,
but he isn't dead.

55:06.973 --> 55:08.274
Vanessa: Oh yeah, right.

55:08.307 --> 55:12.178
I shot him so many times.

55:12.211 --> 55:14.313
Mike: Aren't you concerned
about being tried

55:14.347 --> 55:16.482
as an adult for murder?

55:16.515 --> 55:19.719
Garnett: Vanessa, the reason
we're here is to give you

55:19.752 --> 55:22.421
an opportunity
to change your story.

55:22.455 --> 55:27.660
Vanessa: Well, that would make
me a big fat liar, wouldn't it?

55:27.693 --> 55:31.931
Mike: Look kid. Cooperate,
because right now

55:31.964 --> 55:34.500
we're the best friends
you've got.

55:34.533 --> 55:36.202
Vanessa: Yeah, I'm so sure.

55:36.235 --> 55:37.937
Garnett: You don't believe
we're your friends?

55:37.970 --> 55:41.374
Vanessa: I believe
you're out to ruin me.

55:41.407 --> 55:43.042
Look, I never said
I wouldn't talk.

55:43.075 --> 55:45.411
I might not happen to say
what y'all want to hear.

55:45.444 --> 55:47.413
So, you want me to talk,
that's fine.

55:47.446 --> 55:50.683
But you've got to let me call
my fiancÃ© right afterwards.

55:50.716 --> 55:52.752
Okay?

55:52.785 --> 55:54.754
Garnett: You can.

55:54.787 --> 55:56.122
Mike: Fine.

55:56.155 --> 55:57.990
No problem.

55:58.024 --> 55:59.358
Now talk.

55:59.392 --> 56:00.893
Vanessa: What do
you want to know?

56:00.926 --> 56:05.231
Mike: Did Mr. Wolverton
say he was the I-5 killer?

56:05.264 --> 56:07.666
Vanessa: He didn't
say he wasn't.

56:07.700 --> 56:09.835
Mike: I haven't said
that I'm the I-5 killer.

56:09.869 --> 56:11.937
Vanessa: And you haven't
said that you're going to slash

56:11.971 --> 56:14.740
me dead with a razor and do
sex to my dead body, neither.

56:14.774 --> 56:16.742
Garnett: Mr. Wolverton
said that to you?

56:16.776 --> 56:17.977
Vanessa: Yeah.

56:18.010 --> 56:20.146
Right after he cut
off all my hair.

56:20.179 --> 56:22.982
Then he called me one
of them garbage people.

56:23.015 --> 56:25.351
Then I asked him if he was that
I-5 Killer and he just started

56:25.384 --> 56:27.420
smiling all proud like.

56:27.453 --> 56:31.857
Garnett: You have an opportunity
now to clear your conscience.

56:31.891 --> 56:36.896
Vanessa: I told the truth,
and the truth is eternal.

56:36.929 --> 56:43.302
Mike: Vanessa Lutz, you still
haven't told us why you were

56:43.335 --> 56:46.305
walking around with
a loaded pistol in
the first place.

56:46.338 --> 56:49.041
Vanessa: I was going to
sell it to finance my trip.

56:49.075 --> 56:51.844
Mike: Oh, yet you ended up
shooting some poor slob

56:51.877 --> 56:54.346
who had the decency to give
you a ride instead.

56:54.380 --> 56:56.415
Vanessa: Yeah, except
for the decency part.

56:56.449 --> 56:58.517
Mike: When did you
decide to rob him?

56:58.551 --> 57:00.820
Was it before or
after you shot him?

57:00.853 --> 57:03.322
Vanessa: Look, that perv owed
me for pain and suffering.

57:03.355 --> 57:04.657
So, yeah I took his money.

57:04.690 --> 57:05.991
Mike: Why didn't
you just turn him in?

57:06.025 --> 57:07.726
Vanessa: I wanted to,
but he kept saying that

57:07.760 --> 57:10.196
it would be his word
against mine and that he'd

57:10.229 --> 57:13.732
just get off and I would
go to foster care again.

57:13.766 --> 57:16.268
And aside from that,
I just knew that if
I let him go,

57:16.302 --> 57:18.170
he would go out
and kill some other girl.

57:18.204 --> 57:20.339
And that
would have been my fault.

57:20.372 --> 57:22.675
And I couldn't have
lived with that.

57:22.708 --> 57:25.678
Never. No way.

57:25.711 --> 57:27.113
Garnett: Why were you
so convinced

57:27.146 --> 57:29.415
we wouldn't believe you?

57:29.448 --> 57:30.516
Vanessa: Because I've been
in the system,

57:30.549 --> 57:32.351
and once you've been
in the system once,

57:32.384 --> 57:34.753
ain't no one never going
to believe you again.

57:34.787 --> 57:37.289
It's just how it goes.

57:37.323 --> 57:39.358
Garnett: Tell us about
your past legal problems.

57:39.391 --> 57:41.293
Vanessa: It's all in my file.

57:41.327 --> 57:43.762
Garnett: I want to
hear it from you.

57:43.796 --> 57:49.502
Vanessa: Okay.

57:49.535 --> 57:51.303
All right, when I was younger,
I used to have this

57:51.337 --> 57:53.239
problem with shoplifting.

57:53.272 --> 57:55.040
And I got caught.

57:55.074 --> 57:58.244
And the judge sent me to
this group therapy session

57:58.277 --> 58:00.746
for all these little girls
who was supposed to be clepto.

58:00.779 --> 58:02.348
Mike: How many times
were you arrested for

58:02.381 --> 58:04.617
shoplifting Vanessa?

58:04.650 --> 58:07.786
Vanessa: Seven times.

58:07.820 --> 58:11.891
Mike: What else?

58:11.924 --> 58:15.027
Vanessa: Okay. Now this
is going to sound bad,

58:15.060 --> 58:18.531
but it's not as bad
as it seems, okay?

58:18.564 --> 58:21.800
But I learned later that
I had this problem with anger,

58:21.834 --> 58:24.303
but I don't have
that problem no more.

58:24.336 --> 58:26.505
Mike: Just answer the question.

58:26.539 --> 58:31.544
Vanessa: Back in Texas,
these cops said I lit
this shed on fire.

58:31.577 --> 58:34.747
Mike: What? You were
arrested for arson?

58:34.780 --> 58:36.382
Vanessa: Yeah, but
nobody got hurt.

58:36.415 --> 58:38.117
It was no big deal.

58:38.150 --> 58:39.285
And the judge even said
that I could get it

58:39.318 --> 58:40.452
"explunged" from my record
if I was to go to these

58:40.486 --> 58:42.154
if I was to go to these
group therapy sessions

58:42.188 --> 58:43.856
with all them teenagers

58:43.889 --> 58:46.992
who were supposed to be
firebugs or something.

58:47.026 --> 58:50.763
But, um, that
judge got switched.

58:50.796 --> 58:53.866
So, that's why it's still there.

58:53.899 --> 58:58.304
Mike: How many times were
you arrested for arson?

58:58.337 --> 59:00.973
Vanessa: Three times.

59:01.006 --> 59:05.377
Mike: Okay. What else?

59:05.411 --> 59:08.948
Garnett: Come on
Vanessa, tell us.

59:08.981 --> 59:11.717
Vanessa: Soliciting.

59:11.750 --> 59:14.220
Mike: Just doing what
came natural, huh?

59:14.253 --> 59:17.256
Garnett: Hey Mike.

59:17.289 --> 59:20.359
Vanessa: What's that
supposed to mean?

59:20.392 --> 59:21.994
Garnett: Let's get
back to the questions.

59:22.027 --> 59:23.195
Vanessa: No, uh-uh.

59:23.229 --> 59:25.497
What's that supposed to mean?

59:25.531 --> 59:27.032
What, you think prostitution
comes natural

59:27.066 --> 59:28.567
like being a nigger?

59:28.601 --> 59:30.336
Oh, wait you don't like
being called a nigger?

59:30.369 --> 59:32.638
Well, I don't like being
called a natural born whore.

59:32.671 --> 59:33.739
So there.

59:33.772 --> 59:34.506
Garnett: Sit down.

59:34.540 --> 59:35.774
Vanessa: No!

59:35.808 --> 59:37.810
He's talking to me the
way that fucking guy did.

59:37.843 --> 59:39.345
Mike: Is that why you shot him?

59:39.378 --> 59:42.047
Or was it because you wanted
what was in his wallet?

59:42.081 --> 59:43.582
Vanessa: I already told
you why I shot him,

59:43.616 --> 59:45.551
you shit-skinned motherfucker.

59:45.584 --> 59:46.919
(slap)

59:46.952 --> 59:48.187
(crash)

59:48.220 --> 59:49.989
Mike: (groans)

59:50.022 --> 59:51.490
Vanessa: Come on
you fucking coon!

59:51.523 --> 59:55.928
I'll kick your black ass all
over this fucking station.

59:55.961 --> 59:57.796
Shit head.

59:57.830 --> 01:00:01.600
Garnett: You okay, Mike?

01:00:01.634 --> 01:00:03.002
Why did you call him
those names, Vanessa?

01:00:03.035 --> 01:00:05.271
Vanessa: Because he
didn't say he was sorry.

01:00:05.304 --> 01:00:07.740
And I knew it
would piss him off.

01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:09.475
Now, how about that phone call?

01:00:09.508 --> 01:00:12.344
Come on. Come on.
I need another quarter.

01:00:12.378 --> 01:00:13.812
Come on.

01:00:18.484 --> 01:00:20.252
Hey Mrs. Wood. Is Chopper there?

01:00:30.262 --> 01:00:31.664
(thud)

01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:54.420
Holy shit.

01:00:54.453 --> 01:00:57.956
Look who got beat
with the ugly stick.

01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.360
Is that you, Bob?

01:01:01.393 --> 01:01:04.096
I can't believe such a teeny
weeny little gun made such

01:01:04.129 --> 01:01:05.264
a big mess of some one.

01:01:05.297 --> 01:01:08.734
Lawyer: Are you
out of your mind?

01:01:08.767 --> 01:01:12.204
Vanessa: You are so ugly, Bob!

01:01:12.237 --> 01:01:14.773
That's going to cramp your
style with the babes, big time.

01:01:14.807 --> 01:01:16.108
You know that, huh?

01:01:16.141 --> 01:01:19.178
Especially little
miss priss over there.

01:01:19.211 --> 01:01:22.014
And hey I heard you have
one of them big poop bags

01:01:22.047 --> 01:01:23.248
that's like
attached to your body.

01:01:23.282 --> 01:01:25.451
And all your shit
comes out and like lands in it.

01:01:25.484 --> 01:01:28.287
You're just a big old
shit bag, ain't you Bob?

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.489
You just think of me
every time you empty

01:01:30.522 --> 01:01:32.358
that motherfucking thing,
motherfucker.

01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:34.960
Police officer:
Quiet. Stay there.

01:01:34.993 --> 01:01:36.295
Vanessa: All right.

01:01:36.328 --> 01:01:43.936
Judge: One more word young lady
and you're going to be gagged.

01:01:43.969 --> 01:01:47.473
The people versus
Vanessa Julia Lutz.

01:01:47.506 --> 01:01:49.575
Female lawyer: Your honor,
due to the heinous nature

01:01:49.608 --> 01:01:50.542
of this crime

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:53.212
and the defendant's obvious
lack of remorse,

01:01:53.245 --> 01:01:58.150
the state moves that Vanessa
Julia Lutz be tried as an adult.

01:01:58.183 --> 01:02:02.855
Male lawyer: Your honor, my
client is an illiterate child.

01:02:02.888 --> 01:02:04.490
One only has to
look at her to see--

01:02:04.523 --> 01:02:06.458
Judge: Oh, I've had
my look, counselor.

01:02:06.492 --> 01:02:08.460
And I've been listening, too.

01:02:08.494 --> 01:02:10.863
And I'm going to direct
the youth authority

01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:11.997
to prepare a report

01:02:12.031 --> 01:02:16.201
on the defendant's suitability
to be tried as an adult.

01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:17.269
(knock)

01:02:21.507 --> 01:02:23.675
(blues music)

01:02:40.592 --> 01:02:42.628
(buzzer)

01:02:52.304 --> 01:02:56.074
Mrs. Collins:
Hello there ladies.

01:02:56.108 --> 01:02:58.410
Welcome to Bridgewater.

01:02:58.444 --> 01:03:00.312
I'm Mrs. Collins.

01:03:00.345 --> 01:03:06.018
And if you follow me, I'll
show you to your beds.

01:03:10.255 --> 01:03:12.658
(rap music)

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:30.142
Venus this is yours, number
eight, and Vanessa, number 12.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.815
Hello, Rhonda.

01:03:36.849 --> 01:03:39.485
Rhonda: Hey Mrs. Collins.

01:03:39.518 --> 01:03:40.619
Mrs. Collins: Say
hello to Vanessa.

01:03:40.652 --> 01:03:43.789
Vanessa, this is Rhonda.

01:03:43.822 --> 01:03:47.125
Rhonda: How you doing?

01:03:47.159 --> 01:03:49.394
Mrs. Collins: I was hoping
you could show Vanessa around

01:03:49.428 --> 01:03:52.865
the craft shop later.

01:03:52.898 --> 01:03:54.566
Rhonda: I can't.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:00.606
See, I'm on restriction.

01:04:00.639 --> 01:04:02.841
Mrs. Collins: Rhonda,
what did you do this time?

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:08.313
Rhonda: Mrs. Joiner said
that I was touching Wanda Z.

01:04:08.347 --> 01:04:13.986
all inappropriate.

01:04:14.019 --> 01:04:18.090
Mrs. Collins: Rhonda, I swear.

01:04:25.397 --> 01:04:29.101
Rhonda: So, who'd you kill?

01:04:29.134 --> 01:04:34.072
Vanessa: What makes you
think I killed somebody?

01:04:34.106 --> 01:04:35.774
Rhonda: Because they got
you wearing one of them

01:04:35.807 --> 01:04:39.177
orange murder suits.

01:04:39.211 --> 01:04:42.915
Only the shooters
wear them things.

01:04:42.948 --> 01:04:48.253
Vanessa: Actually, I left him
for dead, but he pulled through.

01:04:48.287 --> 01:04:54.226
Rhonda: Oh, I'm here
for huffing paint.

01:04:54.259 --> 01:04:56.662
Vanessa: They put
you in here for that?

01:04:56.695 --> 01:04:59.698
Rhonda: During the
strip search...

01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:04.069
they found a
gram of tar in my cooch.

01:05:04.102 --> 01:05:06.171
Do you like tar?

01:05:06.204 --> 01:05:10.776
Vanessa: No, heroin is
way to gnarly for me.

01:05:10.809 --> 01:05:14.980
Rhonda: I don't get how a
person could go through their

01:05:15.013 --> 01:05:21.653
whole lives never
being into girls.

01:05:21.687 --> 01:05:25.257
I just--
I love girls.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:27.759
Vanessa: You can keep them.

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:30.762
Rhonda: You don't know
what you're missing.

01:05:39.171 --> 01:05:40.706
Show-off alert.

01:05:43.842 --> 01:05:45.510
Vanessa: How many?

01:05:45.544 --> 01:05:49.681
Rhonda: Three, but you only
got to worry about one.

01:06:01.693 --> 01:06:05.097
Mesquita: Cracker bunny.

01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:10.002
They caught you ditching
school, or what?

01:06:10.035 --> 01:06:14.906
Bitch. I'm fucking
talking to you, man.

01:06:17.409 --> 01:06:19.711
Vanessa: (screaming)

01:06:19.745 --> 01:06:23.181
My name is Vanessa Julia Lutz.

01:06:25.884 --> 01:06:27.052
(buzzer)

01:06:28.253 --> 01:06:30.422
(girls screaming)

01:06:35.127 --> 01:06:38.563
Mrs. Collins: 415 inmates
only, module 1700.

01:06:38.597 --> 01:06:41.099
Vanessa: Say my name before
I break your goddamn head.

01:06:41.133 --> 01:06:42.901
Bitch!

01:06:42.934 --> 01:06:47.105
(girls yelling)

01:06:47.139 --> 01:06:49.808
Rhonda: Stick it in her.

01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:51.209
Stick it in her.

01:06:51.243 --> 01:06:53.278
Guard: Break it up!

01:06:53.311 --> 01:06:56.381
(yelling)

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:04.856
Mrs. Collins: This isn't
going to hurt a bit sweetie,

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:07.426
and afterwards,
you'll have a nice little nap.

01:07:07.459 --> 01:07:09.361
Vanessa: (screaming)

01:07:09.394 --> 01:07:12.364
Mrs. Collins: You can remove
those pesky restraints now.

01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:17.569
Vanessa: (grunting)

01:07:42.527 --> 01:07:43.895
Grandma: Hi, honey.

01:07:43.929 --> 01:07:44.963
Vanessa: Grandma?

01:07:44.996 --> 01:07:48.567
Grandma: Here I am.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.102
Vanessa: Grandma.

01:07:50.135 --> 01:07:55.907
Grandma: Hi. Vanessa.

01:07:55.941 --> 01:07:58.610
Vanessa: Grandma. (echoing)

01:07:58.643 --> 01:08:03.715
Grandma: Vanessa.

01:08:03.749 --> 01:08:05.450
Vanessa.

01:08:07.552 --> 01:08:09.688
(footsteps)

01:08:09.721 --> 01:08:11.790
(keys rattling)

01:08:26.805 --> 01:08:31.343
Mrs. Collins:
Vanessa Julia Lutz.

01:08:31.376 --> 01:08:37.314
Inmate shows no
remorse for her crimes.

01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:42.520
Inmate is combative.

01:08:42.554 --> 01:08:47.058
Refuses to accept
responsibility for her actions.

01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:48.827
Recommendations:

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.895
This inmate appears to be

01:08:50.929 --> 01:08:53.532
a sophisticated criminal,
and an extreme danger

01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:56.968
to society, and should
be required to pay the penalty

01:08:57.002 --> 01:09:03.073
for her actions in a
facility for adult criminals.

01:09:03.108 --> 01:09:04.776
Diagnosis:

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:09.147
Antisocial personality disorder.

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.916
Prognosis:

01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:14.085
Very poor.

01:09:14.118 --> 01:09:18.823
Recommendations:

01:09:18.857 --> 01:09:21.059
This individual is
probably too far gone

01:09:21.091 --> 01:09:24.029
to benefit from corrective
behavior modification

01:09:24.062 --> 01:09:27.899
of the kind offered in
a setting for juveniles.

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:55.427
(dramatic music)

01:09:58.363 --> 01:10:00.799
Hello, Vanessa.

01:10:00.832 --> 01:10:04.569
Do you think you can
join the rest of us now?

01:10:04.603 --> 01:10:07.372
Vanessa: If nobody gives
me no more problems.

01:10:11.376 --> 01:10:16.781
(TV)

01:10:16.815 --> 01:10:19.117
(boos)

01:10:22.487 --> 01:10:25.757
Janice: Hi, this is
Janice Miller,
of Inside View.

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.959
We're here with
Mr. Robert Wolverton and

01:10:27.993 --> 01:10:31.696
his wife Mimi Wolverton,
at their home in Orange County.

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:35.967
Would you describe some of the
hardships you've had to endure

01:10:36.001 --> 01:10:38.570
since this ordeal began?

01:10:38.603 --> 01:10:41.506
Mimi: My husband has been
permanently disfigured.

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.042
How can he ever work
with children again?

01:10:44.075 --> 01:10:48.546
His appearance...
Well, it frightens them.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.849
He's unable to have
sexual relations.

01:10:50.882 --> 01:10:53.919
Janice: You're saying your
husband is no longer capable

01:10:53.952 --> 01:10:55.754
of achieving an erection?

01:10:55.787 --> 01:10:58.323
Mimi: That part of
our lives is over now.

01:10:58.356 --> 01:11:01.860
What makes me so angry is how
that little monster ridiculed us

01:11:01.893 --> 01:11:03.828
during her preliminary hearing.

01:11:03.862 --> 01:11:06.398
And the media...
How dare the media talk about

01:11:06.431 --> 01:11:09.301
how horrible her life is.
What about us?

01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:10.502
That psychopath.

01:11:10.535 --> 01:11:13.572
She's been locked
up nine, ten times?

01:11:13.605 --> 01:11:15.273
Why was she ever let back
out on the streets again

01:11:15.307 --> 01:11:16.975
in the first place?

01:11:17.008 --> 01:11:18.443
Janice: If the teenager
who allegedly shot

01:11:18.476 --> 01:11:20.745
your husband were here,

01:11:20.779 --> 01:11:22.347
what would you
want to say to her?

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.917
Mimi: Was it worth the $300
she stole from my husband?

01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:29.487
Janice: Are you
bitter, Mr. Wolverton?

01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:35.794
Bob: Well just, all the
wonderful letters

01:11:35.827 --> 01:11:40.765
that we received
from across the country.

01:11:40.799 --> 01:11:43.301
Vanessa: (mockingly) My dick
may not function, but I haven't

01:11:43.335 --> 01:11:45.370
lost my smile.

01:11:45.403 --> 01:11:48.840
Bob: I'm not (indistinct).

01:11:48.873 --> 01:11:51.710
Janice: I know there's
a lot of people looking
for some real life

01:11:51.743 --> 01:11:54.379
heroes, and I think
I've found a few.

01:11:54.412 --> 01:11:57.782
Reporter: Their courage
is a real inspiration.

01:11:57.816 --> 01:12:00.652
And now stay tuned for an
unusual story about a couple of

01:12:00.685 --> 01:12:03.455
sweltering polar bears in Texas.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.296
(laughing)

01:12:30.315 --> 01:12:34.919
Vanessa: Holy shit.

01:12:34.953 --> 01:12:37.622
Rhonda: It's okay.

01:12:44.362 --> 01:12:50.535
Let me go get you
some party punch.

01:12:50.568 --> 01:12:56.441
Vanessa: No, I aint thirsty.

01:12:56.474 --> 01:13:02.881
Rhonda: You're all
wigged out, huh?

01:13:02.914 --> 01:13:04.816
Vanessa: Just get all these
bad nightmares once

01:13:04.849 --> 01:13:11.556
I get out of isolation.

01:13:11.589 --> 01:13:18.830
Rhonda: I'm so happy to get
out I can't even sleep at all,

01:13:18.863 --> 01:13:24.002
let alone have nightmares.

01:13:24.035 --> 01:13:29.207
Vanessa: For me it's like
I get all shrunk down.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.445
Rhonda: I don't
get what you mean.

01:13:33.478 --> 01:13:37.816
Vanessa: It's like I get like
a cat or a dog or something.

01:13:37.849 --> 01:13:42.587
Until I'm just
like they all are.

01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.656
I get in the hole
much longer I'm just going

01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:49.260
to be like this hermit,
shunning all human contact.

01:13:49.294 --> 01:13:50.995
Scared like.

01:13:57.669 --> 01:14:00.405
Rhonda: It's like that
song says, Vanessa.

01:14:00.438 --> 01:14:04.742
People need people.

01:14:04.776 --> 01:14:11.216
Vanessa: I ain't so
sure about that, Rhonda.

01:14:11.249 --> 01:14:17.489
Rhonda: Well, what is it
that you think that you need?

01:14:17.522 --> 01:14:19.958
Vanessa: I'll tell you.

01:14:19.991 --> 01:14:24.295
Back in the hole, I decided
all I need to live is my will.

01:14:30.301 --> 01:14:32.403
And a knife is good too.

01:14:32.437 --> 01:14:35.106
So you don't feel so
at the mercy of events.

01:14:39.844 --> 01:14:41.679
Rhonda: You made this?

01:14:41.713 --> 01:14:45.283
Vanessa: Yeah, my stepfather
Larry showed me how.

01:14:45.316 --> 01:14:47.452
Pretty cool, huh?

01:14:51.055 --> 01:14:53.791
Rhonda: What are you
going to do with it?

01:14:53.825 --> 01:14:56.995
Vanessa: Get the
hell out of here.

01:14:57.028 --> 01:15:00.565
Rhonda: You might have to
mess up some of the staff.

01:15:00.598 --> 01:15:03.168
Vanessa: What, you really
feel sorry for them people?

01:15:03.201 --> 01:15:05.370
You think normal people just
wake up one morning and decide

01:15:05.403 --> 01:15:07.105
they're going to
work in a prison?

01:15:07.138 --> 01:15:11.576
They're perverts,
every last one of them.

01:15:11.609 --> 01:15:14.312
Any of them fuckos get in my
way I'm going to make them wish

01:15:14.345 --> 01:15:15.680
they hadn't.

01:15:22.554 --> 01:15:25.223
Rhonda: Do you like that?

01:15:25.256 --> 01:15:31.129
Vanessa: I'll make out
with you, but no fucking.

01:15:31.162 --> 01:15:33.198
Because I'm straight.

01:15:39.671 --> 01:15:42.440
Guard: Okay, you two.

01:15:42.473 --> 01:15:44.309
Male lawyer: Your honor, it's
obvious my client is a child and

01:15:44.342 --> 01:15:45.910
very unstable.

01:15:45.944 --> 01:15:48.046
It says right here:
Nearly illiterate,
emotionally immature,

01:15:48.079 --> 01:15:50.348
prone to impulsivity,
unpredictable.

01:15:50.381 --> 01:15:51.716
Female lawyer: Your
honor, she is charged

01:15:51.749 --> 01:15:53.117
with a gruesome crime.

01:15:53.151 --> 01:15:54.786
Judge: Counselor, please.

01:15:54.819 --> 01:15:56.354
Male lawyer: It goes on to say
she should be tried as an adult.

01:15:56.387 --> 01:15:59.224
Judge: And stand trial
as an adult she will.

01:15:59.257 --> 01:16:00.458
Female lawyer: Thank
you, your honor.

01:16:00.491 --> 01:16:02.160
Judge: Jury selection
will commence on

01:16:02.193 --> 01:16:05.563
June 8th at 10:00 am.

01:16:05.597 --> 01:16:09.567
Vanessa: Are we leaving?

01:16:09.601 --> 01:16:11.135
What are y'all looking at?

01:16:11.169 --> 01:16:12.804
Fuck all y'all.

01:16:12.837 --> 01:16:15.106
Fuck you, chipmunk face.

01:16:15.139 --> 01:16:16.608
And your fucking skipper wife.

01:16:19.177 --> 01:16:20.445
(bell)

01:16:21.613 --> 01:16:23.314
Garnett: I see here that you
and Vanessa were arrested

01:16:23.348 --> 01:16:26.251
together twice in a
period of two years.

01:16:26.284 --> 01:16:28.786
Sharon: Yeah, we
needed the money.

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.855
We thought we'd be all grown up
turning tricks on Warren Avenue

01:16:30.889 --> 01:16:32.390
right outside
the Snack and Shop,

01:16:32.423 --> 01:16:35.827
except we got pinched
in like five minutes.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.595
Bitch.

01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:38.997
Mike: You two were engaged
in acts of prostitution

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:40.498
in the sixth grade.

01:16:40.531 --> 01:16:43.334
Sharon: I was only going
to jack them off, is all.

01:16:43.368 --> 01:16:47.438
Garnett: Did you ever
see Vanessa act in an

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:51.776
overtly hostile way
to an actual human being?

01:16:51.809 --> 01:16:53.311
Sharon: You mean like
blow somebody's brains

01:16:53.344 --> 01:16:54.979
out all over the place?

01:16:55.013 --> 01:16:56.281
Mike: Oh, you
think that's funny?

01:16:56.314 --> 01:16:59.050
Sharon: Yeah. (laughing)

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:03.621
Mike: What about her
boyfriend who passed away?

01:17:03.655 --> 01:17:07.925
Sharon: It was pretty exclusive.

01:17:07.959 --> 01:17:10.295
Garnett: Okay, Sharon,
that will be all for now.

01:17:10.328 --> 01:17:11.963
Thank you very much.

01:17:27.545 --> 01:17:29.714
Sharon: I know she's
blowing it over him.

01:17:39.724 --> 01:17:41.292
Mike: Well, what do you know?

01:17:47.365 --> 01:17:48.900
She's a coal burner.

01:17:48.933 --> 01:17:50.768
Garnett: What's a coal burner?

01:17:50.802 --> 01:17:53.404
Mike: It means her
boyfriend's black.

01:17:53.438 --> 01:17:54.839
Garnett: Are you surprised?

01:17:54.872 --> 01:17:56.507
Mike: Aren't you?

01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:59.110
Garnett: You know Mike,
every kid we've spoken to

01:17:59.143 --> 01:18:02.447
about this Lutz girl seems
to hold her in very high regard.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.881
Mike: Well, Wallace, look
at her friends outside.

01:18:03.915 --> 01:18:05.483
They're the most fucked up
bunch of kids I've ever seen in

01:18:05.516 --> 01:18:07.118
my damn life.

01:18:07.151 --> 01:18:08.953
Still, something just doesn't--

01:18:08.987 --> 01:18:11.255
Garnett: What?

01:18:11.289 --> 01:18:12.890
Mike: I've got to go
back to the crime scene.

01:18:12.924 --> 01:18:14.392
Garnett: It's two and a
half hours away from here.

01:18:14.425 --> 01:18:16.394
Mike: Wallace.

01:18:16.427 --> 01:18:18.162
Garnett: Go, go, go.

01:18:18.196 --> 01:18:20.098
Get it out of your system.

01:19:00.304 --> 01:19:02.974
Mrs. Collins: Go on.

01:19:03.007 --> 01:19:04.509
Diamonds on the back ladies.

01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:08.846
Diamonds on the back.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.148
Guard: Get me some jerky.

01:19:10.181 --> 01:19:11.616
Stay in line.

01:19:23.694 --> 01:19:25.663
Mrs. Collins: Don't forget to
wash your hands now ladies.

01:19:30.334 --> 01:19:32.970
Twin: Do you think that
little guard's cute?

01:19:33.004 --> 01:19:35.573
Twin: I guess,
yeah sort of punky.

01:19:38.609 --> 01:19:39.911
Vanessa: Better watch out
because it's going

01:19:39.944 --> 01:19:42.046
to get pretty crazy
in here in a second.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.582
Twin: You going to cut up
that cute little guard?

01:19:44.615 --> 01:19:47.385
Vanessa: If he gets
in my way, I will.

01:19:47.418 --> 01:19:48.820
Girl: Man, you stupid,
if you think you can

01:19:48.853 --> 01:19:53.825
get past both them two.

01:19:53.858 --> 01:19:56.861
Vanessa: What the fuck do
you care what happens to me?

01:19:56.894 --> 01:20:00.431
Girl: I'm here on
double murder. Okay?

01:20:00.465 --> 01:20:02.166
In two years I'm going to be 18.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.802
I'm going to be sent to Frontera
for 20 fucking years,

01:20:04.836 --> 01:20:08.072
so why the hell shouldn't
we help each other, man?

01:20:08.106 --> 01:20:12.143
Because two heads is a lot
fucking better than one head.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.981
(knocking)

01:20:17.014 --> 01:20:18.950
Mrs. Collins: Hurry
up in there ladies.

01:20:21.118 --> 01:20:22.653
(knocking)

01:20:23.287 --> 01:20:24.622
Come on now.

01:20:24.655 --> 01:20:25.857
Vanessa: All right.

01:20:31.295 --> 01:20:34.232
Vanessa: Don't fucking breathe.

01:20:34.265 --> 01:20:35.500
Mrs. Collins: Vanessa.

01:20:35.533 --> 01:20:37.468
Vanessa: I'm dead
serious. What did I say?

01:20:37.502 --> 01:20:39.170
Mesquita: Where
did he go?

01:20:39.203 --> 01:20:43.441
Mrs. Collins: He went to get a
beef treat, Mesquita,

01:20:43.474 --> 01:20:45.710
and he'll be right back.

01:20:45.743 --> 01:20:47.078
You can't get by the both of us.

01:20:47.111 --> 01:20:48.346
Vanessa: Shut up.

01:20:48.379 --> 01:20:49.213
Mrs. Collins: Think about it.

01:20:49.247 --> 01:20:50.748
Vanessa: Shut up (yelling).

01:21:07.698 --> 01:21:09.500
Twin: My sister Brenda
thinks you're cute.

01:21:09.534 --> 01:21:10.468
Twin: I do not.

01:21:10.501 --> 01:21:11.769
Twin: You do, too.

01:21:11.802 --> 01:21:13.437
Guard: That's good.
Where's Mrs. Collins?

01:21:18.342 --> 01:21:19.477
(groans)

01:21:20.278 --> 01:21:21.145
Vanessa: Yah!

01:21:21.179 --> 01:21:23.614
Who told you you could fight?

01:21:23.648 --> 01:21:24.849
Guard: You didn't
have to kill me.

01:21:24.882 --> 01:21:25.917
Vanessa: What?

01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:27.385
Guard: You didn't
have to kill me.

01:21:27.418 --> 01:21:29.921
Vanessa: I didn't kill you,
you dirty little pervert.

01:21:29.954 --> 01:21:33.090
Give me your goddamn car keys
before I cut your pecker off.

01:21:33.124 --> 01:21:36.727
That won't feel
very good, will it?

01:21:36.761 --> 01:21:38.496
Twin: He sure is bloody.

01:21:38.529 --> 01:21:39.830
Twin: Still think he's cute?

01:21:39.864 --> 01:21:43.467
-Mesquita: (yelling)
-Mrs. Collins: (groaning)

01:21:43.501 --> 01:21:46.070
(yelling)

01:21:48.205 --> 01:21:50.141
Vanessa: Mesquita, I'd
really like to go now.

01:22:05.022 --> 01:22:08.793
Mesquita: Good night, everybody.

01:22:15.066 --> 01:22:17.768
Mesquita: My homeys
are here, Vanessa.

01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:28.112
Flacco: I missed you so much.

01:22:28.145 --> 01:22:31.482
Mesquita: You smell the same.

01:22:31.515 --> 01:22:33.284
Flacco: What happened?

01:22:33.317 --> 01:22:35.786
Mesquita: I was
playing catch up.

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.522
This is Vanessa.

01:22:40.358 --> 01:22:42.259
(speaking Spanish)

01:22:42.293 --> 01:22:46.664
And don't you worry.
Everything's going
to be all right.

01:22:46.697 --> 01:22:48.332
Vanessa: All right.

01:22:55.272 --> 01:22:56.974
Mesquita: You look pretty.

01:22:59.243 --> 01:23:02.813
You will think I'm sound
all feminist and shit.

01:23:02.847 --> 01:23:09.720
It's like the one thing
I learned in jail

01:23:09.754 --> 01:23:14.458
is that girls got to help out
other girls, you know?

01:23:14.492 --> 01:23:17.662
Especially con girls,
because--

01:23:17.695 --> 01:23:22.133
You know what I mean?

01:23:22.166 --> 01:23:26.137
Vanessa: I hear
what you're saying.

01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:27.471
Mesquita: Okay.

01:23:31.742 --> 01:23:33.210
Vanessa: Need me to
drop that off anywhere?

01:23:33.244 --> 01:23:35.279
Flacco: Nah, the
owner he won't mind.

01:23:45.656 --> 01:23:47.558
Mesquita: You going
to need this, girl.

01:23:47.591 --> 01:23:49.627
Vanessa: Oh, Mesquita you've
already done too much for me.

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:50.995
Mesquita: This ain't even $20.

01:23:51.028 --> 01:23:53.497
This bum's a total gas hog.

01:23:53.531 --> 01:23:55.032
Don't be stupid.

01:23:55.066 --> 01:23:58.602
Vanessa: You know, what
I really need is a gun.

01:23:58.636 --> 01:24:08.145
Flacco: You going to give
her my gun?

01:24:08.179 --> 01:24:10.581
Mesquita: I'll get you
another one,pendejo.

01:24:10.614 --> 01:24:13.451
I'll get you a cellular too,
and a beeper.

01:24:13.484 --> 01:24:15.686
I get a hold of your ass.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.855
Watch out for the pigs, Vanessa.

01:24:17.888 --> 01:24:20.558
Vanessa: You know, I'm sorry for
busting your nose that time.

01:24:20.591 --> 01:24:24.028
I was just real upset that day.

01:24:24.061 --> 01:24:26.797
Mesquita: I'm all trying
to work it so I can get

01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:29.233
you to cut put out
for me later on.

01:24:29.266 --> 01:24:32.036
I guess I went about it
pretty dumb, huh?

01:24:32.069 --> 01:24:36.307
Vanessa: Mesquita, I'd put out
for you any day of the week.

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.877
Mesquita: I only
do that in lockup.

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:41.612
Come here.

01:24:45.516 --> 01:24:47.218
(doorbell)

01:24:52.423 --> 01:24:53.858
Mike: Good morning
Mrs. Wolverton.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.728
Mimi: Well, have you found her?

01:24:57.762 --> 01:24:59.597
Garnett: No, we haven't.

01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:01.298
Mike: I really don't think
you're in any danger.

01:25:01.332 --> 01:25:03.100
Mimi: Oh, really?

01:25:03.134 --> 01:25:04.368
Well, your life hasn't
been ruined by

01:25:04.402 --> 01:25:06.971
this little monster, has it?

01:25:07.004 --> 01:25:08.906
Garnett: Is your husband
here now, Mrs. Wolverton?

01:25:08.939 --> 01:25:11.342
Mimi: No, he's at St. John's
doing his physical therapy.

01:25:11.375 --> 01:25:13.711
Now what the hell
are you doing here?

01:25:13.744 --> 01:25:15.179
Garnett: Mike, go over
to the hospital

01:25:15.212 --> 01:25:17.348
and escort Mr. Wolverton
back here, please.

01:25:17.381 --> 01:25:19.984
Mimi: Why?

01:25:20.017 --> 01:25:24.588
Garnett: Mrs. Wolverton, I
have a search warrant here.

01:25:24.622 --> 01:25:25.856
Mimi: What?

01:25:25.890 --> 01:25:27.858
Garnett: If you would just sign
it anywhere, it would be fine.

01:25:27.892 --> 01:25:31.629
Mimi: I'm not signing anything.

01:25:31.662 --> 01:25:33.898
Garnett: Steve, make note that
Mrs. Wolverton refused to sign

01:25:33.931 --> 01:25:35.733
and honor the search warrant.

01:25:35.766 --> 01:25:37.401
Mimi: I don't believe this.

01:25:37.434 --> 01:25:39.437
Mike: So noted.

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:40.571
Garnett: Okay, take
care of the downstairs

01:25:40.604 --> 01:25:42.173
and make sure that you
check out the garage,

01:25:42.206 --> 01:25:44.575
the backyard and
everything thoroughly.

01:25:44.608 --> 01:25:47.711
Mimi: What's this all about?

01:25:47.745 --> 01:25:49.980
Garnett: Mrs. Wolverton, certain
evidence has come to light,

01:25:50.014 --> 01:25:52.416
which we are duty
bound to investigate.

01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:54.185
Mimi: What sort of evidence?

01:25:54.218 --> 01:25:57.054
Garnett: I would prefer
to discuss it in the presence

01:25:57.087 --> 01:26:00.591
of your husband,
if you don't mind.

01:26:00.624 --> 01:26:03.127
Mike: There's a
storage shed out back.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.361
I'm going to take a look.

01:26:04.395 --> 01:26:07.932
You wouldn't happen to
have the key, would you?

01:26:07.965 --> 01:26:09.900
Mimi: Fuck you.

01:26:09.934 --> 01:26:11.202
Mike: Didn't think so.

01:26:13.804 --> 01:26:16.207
(papers falling)

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:35.125
Mike: Robert Wolverton.
Correct. Age 32.

01:26:35.159 --> 01:26:38.062
Yeah, forensics is on its way.

01:26:38.095 --> 01:26:42.132
Tony found some remains,
human, animal who knows.

01:26:42.166 --> 01:26:44.168
Garnett: Mrs. Wolverton,
were you aware your

01:26:44.201 --> 01:26:47.571
husband had mental problems?

01:26:47.605 --> 01:26:51.542
Mimi: Those were--
Those were--

01:26:51.575 --> 01:26:53.477
Those were children?

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:57.348
Mike: Children? Yes.

01:26:57.381 --> 01:26:59.383
Just like the Lutz girl
we've been dying to see get

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.218
strapped down in
the gas chamber.

01:27:04.822 --> 01:27:06.190
Mimi: (whimpering)

01:27:06.223 --> 01:27:07.558
Garnett: Will you
ease up on her?'

01:27:07.591 --> 01:27:09.426
Mike: Fuck her.

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.795
Mimi: (crying)

01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:21.305
(door slams)

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:23.874
(gunshot)

01:27:24.541 --> 01:27:27.311
Mike: Jesus Christ.

01:27:31.315 --> 01:27:32.783
Bob: Shit.

01:27:35.719 --> 01:27:37.488
(tires screeching)

01:27:56.373 --> 01:27:57.541
Vanessa: Por favor.

01:28:01.011 --> 01:28:04.481
Hey ladies,
Donde esta los chicos?

01:28:11.522 --> 01:28:13.557
Sexo.

01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:15.492
Sexo.

01:28:15.526 --> 01:28:16.860
Yeah,muy buena

01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:21.966
Want to screw baby?
Come on.

01:28:25.703 --> 01:28:27.204
Fuck you, too.

01:28:32.176 --> 01:28:34.278
Hey baby.
Ooh, me so horny.

01:28:34.311 --> 01:28:38.882
Yeah, what about now?

01:28:38.916 --> 01:28:42.353
Fuck you, too.

01:28:42.386 --> 01:28:44.188
Back again, huh?

01:28:44.221 --> 01:28:45.489
Wanna fuck?

01:28:45.522 --> 01:28:48.292
Man: How much?

01:28:52.696 --> 01:28:54.798
Vanessa: Depends on
what you're into.

01:28:54.832 --> 01:28:56.000
Man: You suck cock?

01:28:59.536 --> 01:29:02.006
Vanessa: Sure. I can do that.

01:29:04.241 --> 01:29:05.676
Man: I just want
to get sucked.

01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:06.810
Vanessa: All right.

01:29:06.844 --> 01:29:08.078
You just find us an alley
and I'll take care of you

01:29:08.112 --> 01:29:09.513
right where you're sitting.

01:29:09.546 --> 01:29:11.648
Man with tie: I'll pay you $25.

01:29:11.682 --> 01:29:14.685
Vanessa: I can live
with that. Let's go.

01:29:23.127 --> 01:29:24.528
Man: You're
underage, aren't you?

01:29:24.561 --> 01:29:25.829
Vanessa: What, is
that a problem?

01:29:25.863 --> 01:29:29.800
Man: No. Young
people gotta live, too.

01:29:29.833 --> 01:29:31.635
Vanessa: You sure
got that right.

01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:33.303
Now get them all down, okay?

01:29:33.337 --> 01:29:34.905
Makes it a whole
lot easier that way.

01:29:43.747 --> 01:29:46.917
Give me all your
money. All of it.

01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.452
Man: Goddamn it.

01:29:48.485 --> 01:29:52.156
Jesus. Okay. Hey, hey.
I'm sorry, okay?

01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:53.323
Okay?

01:29:53.357 --> 01:29:54.858
Vanessa: I was aiming
at your head, mister.

01:29:54.892 --> 01:29:56.794
Man: Okay, I'm sorry.

01:29:56.827 --> 01:29:58.028
Vanessa: Yeah. If you get this
over quick we'll both be

01:29:58.062 --> 01:30:00.197
a lot happier, okay?

01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:02.566
Man: My money is in
my briefcase in the back seat.

01:30:02.599 --> 01:30:03.834
Vanessa: Don't move it.

01:30:03.867 --> 01:30:07.805
Just lean over and open
it up where it's laying.

01:30:07.838 --> 01:30:11.008
And keep your pants where
they are, mister dirty mouth.

01:30:11.041 --> 01:30:12.409
Man: Okay, okay.

01:30:12.443 --> 01:30:14.211
Okay.

01:30:14.244 --> 01:30:16.346
Vanessa: Don't swing that
motherfucking thing at me

01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.515
or I swear to God you're dead.

01:30:18.549 --> 01:30:19.716
You believe me?

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:21.185
Man: Why
are you doing this?

01:30:21.218 --> 01:30:23.554
Vanessa: Because I'm pissed off
and the whole world owes me.

01:30:23.587 --> 01:30:24.788
Give me your goddamn money.

01:30:35.099 --> 01:30:36.733
Where's the rest of it?

01:30:36.767 --> 01:30:38.602
Man: That's all I got.

01:30:38.635 --> 01:30:41.205
Vanessa: You was just
going to give me $5?

01:30:41.238 --> 01:30:44.308
Man: Please, please,
please, just take it. Okay?

01:30:44.341 --> 01:30:44.374
Please.

01:30:45.409 --> 01:30:46.743
Vanessa: Get out of the
goddamn car right now,

01:30:46.777 --> 01:30:48.479
you little pecker snot.

01:30:48.512 --> 01:30:50.848
Right now!

01:30:50.881 --> 01:30:52.316
No, uh-uh.

01:30:52.349 --> 01:30:58.422
You get all them panties off
before I get really pissed.

01:30:58.455 --> 01:30:59.890
You think I'm kidding?

01:30:59.923 --> 01:31:01.792
(gunshots)

01:31:01.825 --> 01:31:06.096
Now get your ass in the trunk.

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:09.099
Man: Please,
I'm claustrophobic.

01:31:09.133 --> 01:31:10.634
Vanessa: Yeah. Well,
I get claustrophobic

01:31:10.667 --> 01:31:13.203
sucking strange dick.
Get in there.

01:31:13.237 --> 01:31:15.139
Man: Please, please.

01:31:15.172 --> 01:31:16.106
I gotta pee.

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.275
Vanessa: Well, pee in
there motherfucker.

01:31:18.308 --> 01:31:21.411
I ain't kidding. Now.

01:31:21.445 --> 01:31:22.780
Dumbass.

01:31:26.783 --> 01:31:29.219
Flo: I'm sorry sir. This
is a no smoking restaurant.

01:31:44.301 --> 01:31:47.304
Bob: You really are
a dear, Flo.

01:31:51.842 --> 01:31:54.344
Flo: Would you
care for a warm up?

01:31:54.378 --> 01:31:56.246
Bob: No, thank you.

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:59.183
I'd like to order.

01:31:59.216 --> 01:32:01.251
Flo: What would you like?

01:32:01.285 --> 01:32:04.655
Bob: Chicken soup...
with a fucking straw.

01:32:20.938 --> 01:32:23.373
(dramatic music)

01:32:37.854 --> 01:32:39.590
Man: Let me out.
I'm dying in here.

01:32:39.623 --> 01:32:43.026
Vanessa: Oh, you
are? Well, do it now.

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:44.795
Garnett: Will you slow
down for Christ's sake?

01:32:44.828 --> 01:32:48.332
You're going to get us killed.

01:32:48.365 --> 01:32:49.866
There. There's the exit.

01:33:01.645 --> 01:33:03.113
Vanessa: Grandma.

01:33:04.848 --> 01:33:05.849
Grandma.

01:33:07.317 --> 01:33:08.418
Grandma.

01:33:10.821 --> 01:33:13.090
Grandma.

01:33:14.591 --> 01:33:16.927
(dramatic music)

01:34:09.646 --> 01:34:12.683
(man yelling in trunk)

01:34:16.987 --> 01:34:19.323
Vanessa: Grandma, it's me!

01:34:19.356 --> 01:34:21.892
It's me Vanessa!

01:34:21.925 --> 01:34:23.927
Hey, Grandma!

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:27.431
It's me Vanessa.

01:34:27.464 --> 01:34:32.169
Hi, Grandma.
Grandma, wake up.

01:34:32.202 --> 01:34:34.204
It's time to wake up.

01:34:34.237 --> 01:34:35.572
I'm your granddaughter.

01:34:35.605 --> 01:34:37.341
I'm here to take care of you
forever and ever and ever.

01:34:37.374 --> 01:34:41.378
Why are you hiding?

01:34:41.411 --> 01:34:42.746
Here, let me see.

01:34:47.784 --> 01:34:51.888
Them some big ugly
fucking teeth you got, Bob.

01:34:51.922 --> 01:34:56.426
Bob: How do you
like that, Vanessa?

01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.261
You like how that fucking feels?

01:34:58.295 --> 01:34:59.863
Vanessa: What did you
do with my grandma?

01:34:59.896 --> 01:35:01.331
Bob: You want to
see your grandma?

01:35:04.768 --> 01:35:07.070
Why don't you give
Grandma a kiss?

01:35:07.104 --> 01:35:08.705
Vanessa: You fucker!

01:35:08.739 --> 01:35:10.307
You killed my grandma.

01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:11.975
Bob: That's not all
I did to Grandma.

01:35:17.013 --> 01:35:19.282
Man: Naomi. Listen,
I brought you an extension cord.

01:35:19.316 --> 01:35:20.250
(gunshot)

01:35:20.784 --> 01:35:21.952
(Vanessa grunting)

01:35:24.521 --> 01:35:25.589
(gunshot)

01:35:25.622 --> 01:35:26.623
Vanessa: Die, you piece of shit.

01:35:26.656 --> 01:35:28.091

01:35:29.359 --> 01:35:31.495

01:35:31.528 --> 01:35:33.230
Die, fucker.

01:35:33.263 --> 01:35:34.965
(gunshot)

01:35:38.135 --> 01:35:40.470
Garnett: Back inside.

01:35:44.341 --> 01:35:46.143
(gunshot)

01:35:46.176 --> 01:35:48.211
Vanessa: Die, you piece of shit.

01:35:51.314 --> 01:35:52.816
Mike: Let's go.

01:35:52.849 --> 01:35:54.885

01:35:57.888 --> 01:36:00.624
Vanessa: Piece of shit!

01:36:00.657 --> 01:36:03.493
Fucking perv.

Mike: Vanessa.

01:36:05.328 --> 01:36:07.063

01:36:17.808 --> 01:36:19.576
(groaning)

01:36:31.054 --> 01:36:32.189
Come on!

01:36:34.991 --> 01:36:36.226
Shit.

01:36:36.259 --> 01:36:37.861
Get out of there.

01:36:37.894 --> 01:36:39.463
Get out of there.

01:36:59.116 --> 01:37:02.085
Garnett: Holy shit.

01:37:04.855 --> 01:37:06.156
Holy shit.

01:37:09.259 --> 01:37:11.394
Holy shit.

01:37:23.807 --> 01:37:25.408
Vanessa: Y'all got a cigarette?

01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:28.478
(laughing)

01:37:30.046 --> 01:37:33.049
(up-tempo music)
