WEBVTT

00:09.735 --> 00:12.613
NARRATOR: Even though
it was only a hundred miles

00:12.654 --> 00:15.699
from her hometown
of Newport Beach,

00:15.741 --> 00:19.203
the desert created a whole new
value system for Lindsay Bluth.

00:19.245 --> 00:21.705
I'd give $20,000
for a lemonade right now.

00:21.747 --> 00:23.624
For the most part.

00:23.665 --> 00:26.501
It was here that she'd moved
with her activist boyfriend...

00:26.543 --> 00:29.713
Marky! Mommy needs mescaline!

00:29.755 --> 00:30.756
...and his mother.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.883
And tell your girlfriend DeBrie

00:32.925 --> 00:34.135
to shovel that ostrich crap!

00:34.176 --> 00:35.761
It's not DeBrie, Ma Bark.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.429
It's Lindsay.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.098
I just cut off my hair.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.390
I know who you are.

00:40.432 --> 00:41.683
Now start shoveling!

00:41.725 --> 00:43.644
God, you're lazier than Lindsay.

00:43.685 --> 00:44.645
(sighs)

00:44.686 --> 00:46.688
(gasps)
Marky, hurry!

00:46.730 --> 00:48.565
- There's another dead iguana.
- Oh.

00:48.607 --> 00:50.316
What does this mean?

00:50.358 --> 00:52.236
Probably those bastards
next door.

00:52.278 --> 00:55.114
The bastards next door were
actually a gathered group

00:55.156 --> 00:59.243
of CEOs who were attending
a mid-summer sweat and squeeze.

00:59.285 --> 01:00.869
MARKY:
They want us off their land.

01:00.911 --> 01:02.830
Probably so they can
build a border wall.

01:02.871 --> 01:05.749
They just want to separate
the whites from the browns.

01:05.791 --> 01:07.584
You really are color-blind.

01:07.626 --> 01:08.877
Face-blind.

01:08.919 --> 01:10.504
Fortunately, I can see color.

01:10.545 --> 01:13.381
That's how I can tell
the browns are the Mexicans.

01:13.423 --> 01:16.010
Anyway, I thought
I scared those bastards off

01:16.051 --> 01:17.219
by scaring their leader.

01:17.261 --> 01:19.054
The strong will become the weak.

01:19.096 --> 01:21.890
But I think I overdid it first
on the maca, because I ended up

01:21.932 --> 01:23.517
seeing two of him.

01:23.558 --> 01:25.311
But to kill an innocent iguana,

01:25.351 --> 01:27.313
this beautiful creature
of the desert...

01:27.353 --> 01:28.772
- (hissing)
- That lizard bastard bit me!

01:28.814 --> 01:30.065
God!

01:30.107 --> 01:31.900
Who keeps numbing
these desert animals?

01:31.942 --> 01:32.985
No, no, we'll kill it later.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.153
Mom, lizard bite!

01:34.195 --> 01:35.737
Put some rubbing mescaline
on it!

01:35.779 --> 01:37.531
NARRATOR:
Lindsay hated her new life,

01:37.572 --> 01:38.824
but even more,
she hated herself

01:38.866 --> 01:40.575
for hating her new life.

01:40.617 --> 01:42.619
Marky, I just don't know how
much more of this I can take.

01:42.661 --> 01:44.496
I'm surrounded
by squalor and death,

01:44.538 --> 01:46.498
and I still can't be happy.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.083
Yeah, well,
it's only gonna get worse,

01:48.125 --> 01:50.127
'cause they're chasing us
off the land.

01:50.169 --> 01:51.419
I mean, where are we gonna go?

01:51.461 --> 01:52.504
Hey, new girl, I just heard

01:52.546 --> 01:54.173
about your mother's trial.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.757
She was sent away.

01:55.799 --> 01:58.677
Lindsay had missed
her own mother's trial,

01:58.719 --> 02:01.263
and for that, she'd never
be able to forgive her...

02:01.305 --> 02:03.098
Hey, I know a place
that just opened up.

02:03.140 --> 02:04.391
...herself.

02:04.432 --> 02:06.393
Now the story of a family

02:06.434 --> 02:08.562
whose future
was abruptly canceled,

02:08.603 --> 02:11.065
and the one daughter
who had no choice

02:11.106 --> 02:13.275
but to keep her life together.

02:17.487 --> 02:19.406
It's Lindsay's
Arrested Development.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.077
- Lindsay wanted to move
- That's great.

02:23.118 --> 02:25.120
to her mother's
empty penthouse,

02:25.162 --> 02:26.372
- but Marky wouldn't think
- You dropped your shovel.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.623
of leaving the old bird behind.

02:28.665 --> 02:29.875
(clucking)

02:29.917 --> 02:31.668
So it was a party of three

02:31.710 --> 02:34.963
that had to sneak into
the Balboa Towers.

02:36.965 --> 02:38.508
Although Marky
was having trouble

02:38.550 --> 02:40.344
- accepting what appeared to be
- Come on, Cindy.

02:40.386 --> 02:41.595
a lavish lifestyle.

02:41.636 --> 02:43.013
- What do you think?
- Ugh.

02:43.055 --> 02:44.848
Smells weird in here.
What is that?

02:44.890 --> 02:47.268
I think it's just... not urine.

02:47.309 --> 02:48.810
And we're not moving in,

02:48.852 --> 02:51.397
we're occupying a space
with central air.

02:51.437 --> 02:52.356
(Cindy squawks)

02:52.398 --> 02:53.357
Cindy?

02:53.399 --> 02:55.192
You okay?

02:55.234 --> 02:57.945
(chuckles): Look, Lindsay,
Cindy already marked the master.

02:57.986 --> 02:58.946
Okay.

02:58.987 --> 03:01.156
This will be where she goes.

03:01.198 --> 03:02.783
So we're staying.

03:02.824 --> 03:06.703
And we will change the world
and hold our heads high.

03:06.745 --> 03:11.083
And it might be nice to live
like normal people for a change.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.668
Let's put some newspaper
on these windows.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.381
(clucking)

03:17.423 --> 03:19.674
One year later, however,

03:19.716 --> 03:21.843
the only thing
they'd actually changed was

03:21.885 --> 03:24.388
getting the "not urine" smell
out of the penthouse.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.223
(clucking)

03:27.433 --> 03:28.558
You're looking at Lindsay.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.601
Still Lindsay.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.061
Oh. Hey, Linds.

03:31.103 --> 03:32.980
- How was beg?
- Beg was good.

03:33.021 --> 03:34.731
I found sometres lechescake.

03:34.773 --> 03:35.774
That's great.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.484
Hey, did you clean up?

03:37.525 --> 03:40.028
No, no, I just cleared out a
space to work on the Love bomb.

03:40.070 --> 03:42.990
Oh, okay. I'll, uh, change
out of these filthy clothes

03:43.031 --> 03:44.450
and into some filthy lingerie.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.243
I don't think I washed it.

03:46.285 --> 03:49.621
No, I meant what we're gonna do
to this guy-- Herbert Love.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.206
Oh.

03:51.248 --> 03:53.167
Herbert Love was a very
conservative candidate

03:53.208 --> 03:55.169
for a very conservative seat
in the very conservative

03:55.210 --> 03:56.795
- House of Representatives.
- Look, look, look.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.089
Am I guilty of anything? Yes.

03:59.131 --> 04:01.342
Of having a great
sense of humor.

04:01.383 --> 04:03.885
But the two women
who accused me of this crime

04:03.927 --> 04:06.054
donothave
a great sense of humor.

04:06.096 --> 04:08.849
Look, in fact, I'll tell you the
joke and let you be the judge...

04:08.890 --> 04:10.434
Although he was prone to

04:10.476 --> 04:12.144
the more than occasional
harassment scandal.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.561
I forgot the joke.

04:13.603 --> 04:15.939
Oh, he's about to be harassed,
all right.

04:15.981 --> 04:18.565
I'm gonna spray the bastards
with ink and glitter.

04:18.608 --> 04:20.694
It'll be in their ears
for weeks.

04:20.735 --> 04:22.737
Thing is, I can't find
the glitter anywhere.

04:22.779 --> 04:24.156
Did you take the silver glitter?

04:24.198 --> 04:26.283
Nope. I mean,
I'd say check the junk drawer,

04:26.325 --> 04:28.076
but I can't
differentiate anymore.

04:28.118 --> 04:30.454
Oh, God, what is this?

04:30.496 --> 04:31.663
Oh. Okay, good.
Perfect timing,

04:31.705 --> 04:33.165
because this is
where you come in.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.501
A lot of this has to do
with ink compression,

04:35.542 --> 04:37.127
oxygen capacity,
expulsion pressures.

04:37.169 --> 04:40.214
But the point is,
three days before the event,

04:40.255 --> 04:42.341
I'm gonna take the explosive
and hide in the podium.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.259
On the night of the event,
at exactly 7:30,

04:44.301 --> 04:45.802
I'm gonna pull the pin
to the tank.

04:45.844 --> 04:47.429
Then you're gonna (knocking)
knock on the podium door

04:47.471 --> 04:49.264
to let me know
that the coast is clear.

04:49.306 --> 04:52.226
When Love steps up to the podium
at exactly 8:00, blam!

04:52.267 --> 04:55.521
The podium doors burst open,
and he and everyone will be...

04:55.562 --> 04:57.231
Blue in the face, yeah.

04:57.272 --> 04:59.024
That's better than
what I had, actually.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.859
I was gonna say they'd be
covered in ink and glitter.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.404
Or we can support Lucille 2,
who he's running against.

05:03.445 --> 05:04.988
She's right across the hall.

05:05.030 --> 05:07.574
No, no!
She's part of the problem.

05:07.615 --> 05:09.617
Wait, you haven't been
going over there, by the way?

05:09.659 --> 05:11.412
- No one can know we're here.
- Of course not.

05:11.453 --> 05:13.372
Does it look like I'm lying?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.457
It did.

05:15.499 --> 05:18.335
But not to a man
with face-blindness.

05:18.377 --> 05:20.254
Yeah, no, I guess not.

05:20.295 --> 05:22.005
Because Lindsay
could only spend

05:22.047 --> 05:24.049
so many hours with a shrill,
feathered creature...

05:24.091 --> 05:25.092
(Lucille 2 squawks)

05:25.133 --> 05:26.510
...and needed to get away.

05:26.552 --> 05:28.554
You look marvelous in that!

05:28.595 --> 05:29.888
Here, try this on.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.473
I can't believe
how much I've missed

05:31.515 --> 05:33.141
the feel of anything
that isn't hemp.

05:33.183 --> 05:34.184
And try this on.

05:34.226 --> 05:35.601
Isn't that funny?

05:35.643 --> 05:37.354
I used to wear that
with the Captain.

05:37.396 --> 05:38.355
And I was...

05:38.397 --> 05:39.731
Tennille?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.900
And not make contact, yes!

05:41.942 --> 05:44.278
What am I gonna do,
cut it down for my foster child?

05:44.319 --> 05:46.071
That is what she wanted to do,

05:46.113 --> 05:49.615
until he threatened to call
Social Services.

05:49.657 --> 05:51.617
Oh, look what I made you.

05:51.659 --> 05:53.287
Oh! I love it!

05:53.328 --> 05:55.163
It's glittery!

05:55.205 --> 05:58.624
Lindsay was no stranger
to making campaign posters,

05:58.666 --> 06:01.211
having made several
in her seventh grade

06:01.253 --> 06:04.131
class president campaign
against Sally Sitwell.

06:04.172 --> 06:06.716
Sally ultimately
proved successful

06:06.758 --> 06:09.261
with a more fact-based
campaign.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.762
A couple of tiny notes, hon.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.348
There are two S's in "congress."

06:13.390 --> 06:15.142
And I just
call myself Lucille...

06:15.183 --> 06:16.893
Lucille 1. I'm so sorry.

06:16.935 --> 06:18.145
No.

06:18.186 --> 06:19.229
Just Lucille.

06:19.271 --> 06:20.772
But I love it!

06:20.814 --> 06:23.317
Oh, I wish you'd officially work
for my campaign.

06:23.358 --> 06:24.568
We could make such a difference.

06:24.610 --> 06:26.736
Well, Marky says that's not

06:26.778 --> 06:28.155
the way we should make change.

06:28.196 --> 06:29.655
Oh, speaking of, do you mind

06:29.697 --> 06:31.699
if I go through
your couch cushions?

06:31.741 --> 06:34.744
Oh, honey, I wish you'd take the
rest of thistres lechescake.

06:34.786 --> 06:37.080
It's from a dear
Hispanic supporter.

06:37.122 --> 06:40.167
And I'll never get it
into the bay in one piece.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.544
Honestly, Lucille 2,
you've been like a mother to me.

06:42.586 --> 06:44.045
Aw.

06:44.087 --> 06:46.965
Except kind and loving
and willing to let me eat.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.259
It just blows me away.

06:49.301 --> 06:50.885
Lindsay knew she had to keep

06:50.927 --> 06:53.180
her secret life
of luxury hidden...

06:53.221 --> 06:54.515
You're looking at Lindsay.

06:54.556 --> 06:55.681
Still Lindsay.

06:55.723 --> 06:57.142
...from a boyfriend that was

06:57.184 --> 06:58.977
preparing to squat in a podium

06:59.019 --> 07:00.770
for three days
with a paint bomb.

07:00.812 --> 07:02.730
But, Marky, I mean,
won't you go crazy in there?

07:02.772 --> 07:04.774
Oh, no, that's nothing.
I once did a week and a half

07:04.816 --> 07:06.276
in an oil drum
just to throw a pie

07:06.318 --> 07:07.361
at Arnold Schwarzenegger.
(chuckles)

07:07.402 --> 07:08.778
I never heard about that.

07:08.820 --> 07:10.780
Oh, yeah, well,
the press tried to spin it as

07:10.822 --> 07:13.116
"Hippie tries to play pie-tin
Frisbee with the governor,"

07:13.158 --> 07:15.118
but... this time,
I'm eating beforehand.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.120
Yeah, I-I see that.

07:17.162 --> 07:18.872
Hey, can I get you a fork?

07:18.913 --> 07:22.167
'Cause that's my brother
whose face you're licking.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.336
That's a face?

07:24.378 --> 07:26.547
Everything I do is wrong.

07:26.588 --> 07:27.797
- (sighs)
- I knew you wouldn't be

07:27.839 --> 07:28.840
on board with this, Lindsay.

07:28.882 --> 07:29.924
I'm sorry to say this,

07:29.966 --> 07:31.426
but you are losing your passion.

07:31.468 --> 07:33.679
What passion?
You don't even look at me.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.597
I don't know
if I've said this before--

07:35.639 --> 07:37.057
it's not important or anything--

07:37.098 --> 07:38.684
but I'm really, really pretty.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.310
I'm the straightest guy
you know!

07:40.352 --> 07:41.645
Why does every man feel like

07:41.687 --> 07:43.146
they have to say that to me?

07:43.188 --> 07:45.357
- (clucking)
- Quiet! Cindy's in heat.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.192
You know how much she hates it
when we argue.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.985
(whispering): Now listen to me.
This protest of mine

07:49.027 --> 07:51.321
- can really make a difference.
- Yeah, it's gonna land you

07:51.363 --> 07:52.573
- in jail, Marky.
- Oh, there it is.

07:52.614 --> 07:53.865
Oh, yeah, so that's-- oh, yeah.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.450
You know what,
you are just as selfish

07:55.492 --> 07:56.993
- and money-hungry
as you ever were. -No, I'm...

07:57.035 --> 07:58.870
- Yes, you are.
- That's not true.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.788
Ooh, a Neiman's catalog.

08:00.830 --> 08:04.376
But it was what she found
stuck inside the catalog

08:04.418 --> 08:05.919
that got her attention.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.629
And that's when she found
the mother lode.

08:07.671 --> 08:10.798
"From Gangie 4: Facelift."

08:10.840 --> 08:13.427
What a load of...

08:13.468 --> 08:15.011
Mother.

08:15.053 --> 08:17.805
And this time, she did
make a court appearance.

08:17.847 --> 08:20.767
Cheryl, you've got no backhand!

08:20.808 --> 08:22.269
I'm working the whole court,

08:22.310 --> 08:25.439
and you keep hitting the balls
(bleep) high.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.900
Oh, great, looks like we've got
another high-end hooker in here.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.318
Oh, thank you, Mother.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.529
LUCILLE:
So, let's cut to the chase.

08:32.571 --> 08:36.157
I want to talk to you about
a check for plastic surgery.

08:36.198 --> 08:38.243
I already wrote you
a check for that.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.245
NARRATOR: Lucille had,
back when Lindsay thought

08:40.287 --> 08:42.871
- she was only 12 years old.
- New nose.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.792
Worrying it would hurt
her daughter's feelings...

08:45.833 --> 08:47.210
Put a "Y" on there.

08:47.252 --> 08:49.212
...she put a fun spin on it.

08:49.254 --> 08:50.838
- "Nosy."
- LUCILLE: And you should be

08:50.880 --> 08:52.215
thanking me for that.

08:52.257 --> 08:53.967
You looked like a can opener.

08:54.008 --> 08:56.219
No, a check for my daughter.

08:56.261 --> 08:57.429
She's gorgeous.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.139
And I love her
just the way she is.

08:59.180 --> 09:01.141
When was the last time
you saw her?

09:01.182 --> 09:04.269
She's been living
with her father the past year,

09:04.311 --> 09:08.440
and it's been... really hard.

09:08.482 --> 09:11.652
I'll be out on parole
by the time you work up a tear.

09:11.693 --> 09:14.613
What makes you think I wrote
a check to your daughter, nosy?

09:14.655 --> 09:15.989
It came to the penthouse.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.658
Well, well.

09:17.699 --> 09:20.076
Little Miss Lives-Off-the-Land
is living in my penthouse.

09:20.118 --> 09:23.371
Okay, so you figured it out,
Gene Parmesan.

09:23.413 --> 09:27.709
Just goes to show, the apple
does not far from the tree fall.

09:27.751 --> 09:30.086
I am like you nothing.

09:30.128 --> 09:32.339
You're not even my real mother.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.965
I am a political activist.

09:34.007 --> 09:37.344
Oh, you're a lot more like me
than you know, sister.

09:37.385 --> 09:39.596
Except I can back up
my bad choices.

09:39.638 --> 09:41.431
I'm doing hard time.

09:41.473 --> 09:43.809
Your 3:00 p.m.
hot rock massage is open.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.644
Thanks for coming, sweetheart.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.604
- Mm.
- NARRATOR: But Lindsay wanted

09:47.646 --> 09:49.815
to prove that she wasn't like
her so-called mother.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.692
(sighs)

09:51.733 --> 09:54.027
And that's why she did this.

09:55.236 --> 09:56.738
I'm in.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.824
Let's bomb the bastard.

10:00.158 --> 10:01.576
It's Lindsay.

10:01.618 --> 10:04.120
Oh, yes!
(laughs): Yeah!

10:07.123 --> 10:09.292
NARRATOR: Lindsay and her
boyfriend Marky arrived in--

10:09.334 --> 10:11.837
get this--
Beverly Hills to prepare

10:11.878 --> 10:14.381
for their act
of glittery social protest.

10:14.422 --> 10:17.384
But Lindsay was having
second thoughts.

10:17.425 --> 10:19.469
Marky, look, um,

10:19.511 --> 10:22.514
I have this check that my mother
wrote for my daughter.

10:22.556 --> 10:25.308
It can buy us a lot of leaflets
against Love.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.227
And also a lot
of Nature's Miracle.

10:27.268 --> 10:29.771
You know, there's a huge sale
going on right now at Petco...

10:29.813 --> 10:31.314
No, never! Rip it up! No money!

10:31.356 --> 10:33.941
And don't worry,
I've thought of everything.

10:33.983 --> 10:35.151
He had.

10:35.193 --> 10:36.403
Except for someone
to watch Cindy.

10:36.444 --> 10:38.238
(laughs):
Oh, but she's locked in.

10:38.279 --> 10:39.447
What's the worst
that can happen?

10:39.489 --> 10:41.282
(screaming, squawking)

10:43.326 --> 10:44.952
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

10:44.994 --> 10:46.705
Ah! What a great day to step out

10:46.747 --> 10:48.915
onto an over-irrigated
golf course and play a game

10:48.956 --> 10:52.377
that wastes vast acres
of usable, farm-able land.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.379
And after a few nights
in the trailer,

10:54.421 --> 10:58.341
Lindsay showed up
in Lucille 2's Tennille wig

10:58.383 --> 11:00.677
to be ready to release Marky
from the podium

11:00.719 --> 11:02.721
at the appointed time,

11:02.763 --> 11:05.139
and then stroll out together
in disguise.

11:05.181 --> 11:07.267
I think that's what
this part refers to

11:07.308 --> 11:08.727
back when the disguise was

11:08.769 --> 11:10.771
going to be
a two-part horse costume.

11:10.812 --> 11:14.148
But soon, she ran into a father
she hadn't seen in over a year.

11:14.190 --> 11:17.819
Lindsay, I forgot,
you dyed your hair.

11:17.861 --> 11:19.237
Do you have any money?

11:19.279 --> 11:20.363
And that's how Lindsay

11:20.405 --> 11:22.783
parted with the check for Maeby

11:22.824 --> 11:25.577
that Marky had told her
to rip up.

11:25.619 --> 11:27.120
And it was then
she ran into a daughter...

11:27.161 --> 11:28.747
Maeby.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.457
...whose $50,000 check
she'd just given away...

11:30.498 --> 11:31.750
Mom.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.167
...stealing some
coconut shrimp.

11:33.209 --> 11:34.377
Of course you're here.

11:34.419 --> 11:36.129
I should've known you'd be

11:36.170 --> 11:38.005
- supporting this right-wing,
dangerous crackpot. -No, no.

11:38.047 --> 11:40.634
I am here undercover
with my boyfriend.

11:40.675 --> 11:42.552
We are gonna take down Love

11:42.594 --> 11:46.180
with a random act
of senseless nonviolence.

11:46.222 --> 11:48.224
Maeby felt a foreign feeling.

11:48.266 --> 11:50.310
I actually respect that.

11:50.351 --> 11:51.937
- Thank you, Maeby.
- Which is why,

11:51.977 --> 11:54.147
for the first time
in her adult life...

11:54.188 --> 11:55.732
So what are you doing here?

11:55.774 --> 11:58.192
...Maeby was totally honest
with her mother.

11:58.234 --> 12:00.236
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award

12:00.278 --> 12:02.489
for my work
in the entertainment business.

12:02.530 --> 12:03.989
I tried.

12:04.031 --> 12:05.700
Tell your therapist I tried.

12:05.742 --> 12:08.244
NARRATOR: But realizing
she was still too early

12:08.286 --> 12:10.163
to let Marky out of the podium,

12:10.204 --> 12:12.457
Lindsay headed to the bar,

12:12.499 --> 12:14.417
and that's when she met the man
she was there to sabotage...

12:14.459 --> 12:15.877
Is it just me,

12:15.919 --> 12:18.672
or are we the only two people
who don't fit in

12:18.713 --> 12:21.925
with all these
Orange County phonies?

12:21.967 --> 12:23.844
(sighs)

12:23.885 --> 12:25.553
...and had no idea who he was.

12:25.595 --> 12:27.722
They are a bunch of phonies.

12:27.764 --> 12:29.056
I usually don't even go
to these things.

12:29.098 --> 12:30.266
NARRATOR:
And perhaps it was

12:30.308 --> 12:31.893
because he reminded her so much

12:31.935 --> 12:34.479
of Tobias
when they first started dating,

12:34.521 --> 12:36.189
but Lindsay flirted back.

12:36.230 --> 12:37.649
What's your name, princess?

12:37.691 --> 12:40.151
Cindy Featherbottom.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.529
Of the Laguna Beach
Featherbottoms?

12:42.570 --> 12:44.364
Are you trying to find out
where I live?

12:44.405 --> 12:46.950
- And your favorite kind
of jewelry. - (both laugh)

12:46.992 --> 12:48.785
NARRATOR: Lindsay hadn't heard
the word "jewelry"

12:48.827 --> 12:51.162
in a long time
but tried to stay strong.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.123
How do I know you're not
one of these phonies?

12:54.165 --> 12:58.252
The only phony I'm interested in
is your phony number.

12:58.294 --> 13:00.254
NARRATOR: And like Cinderella
at the ball,

13:00.296 --> 13:02.799
Lindsay really felt
like a princess for a change...

13:02.841 --> 13:04.009
Okay.

13:04.049 --> 13:05.760
...but also like Cinderella,

13:05.802 --> 13:08.304
- she lost track of the time...
- It's, uh, 714... -Mm-hmm.

13:08.346 --> 13:09.597
(explosion)

13:09.639 --> 13:11.182
(Marky screams)

13:11.224 --> 13:13.434
- (Lindsay sighing)
- ...and had forgotten

13:13.476 --> 13:16.145
to release Marky
from the podium,

13:16.187 --> 13:18.063
and that's when she was struck

13:18.105 --> 13:19.315
- with an eerie sense...
- Right this way, sir,

13:19.357 --> 13:21.066
- right this way.
- ...of dÃ©jÃ  vu.

13:21.108 --> 13:22.151
Lindsay.

13:22.193 --> 13:25.446
Oh, God, he blued himself.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.785
NARRATOR: Lindsay's attempt
to create a disaster

13:30.827 --> 13:33.120
for Herbert Love was
a complete disaster,

13:33.162 --> 13:35.957
and as she tried to slip away
without drawing attention

13:35.999 --> 13:37.959
to herself, she was
once again approached...

13:38.001 --> 13:39.794
- Cindy Featherbottom.-... by the
man whose name she never got.

13:39.836 --> 13:41.212
Here's my private number.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.547
Give me a call;
perhaps we can engage

13:42.589 --> 13:45.216
- in some sexual congress.
- Although that's

13:45.258 --> 13:47.176
a total giveaway, right?

13:47.218 --> 13:49.679
What a wonderful sense of humor.

13:49.721 --> 13:51.723
I'd like that very much.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.516
Sir, the press awaits.

13:53.558 --> 13:54.726
Now, I don't know what this nut
was protesting tonight.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.101
I thought you were supposed
to be sticking it

13:56.143 --> 13:57.896
to the man,
not the other way around.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.272
Maeby.

13:59.313 --> 14:00.774
You think he likes me that way?

14:00.815 --> 14:03.192
No, Mom, that's Herbert Love,

14:03.234 --> 14:04.235
the man you're here to protest.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.445
And I hear the guy with the bomb

14:05.486 --> 14:06.613
snuck up here from Mexico.

14:06.654 --> 14:07.655
That's why I say,

14:07.697 --> 14:10.992
we have got to build a wall

14:11.034 --> 14:13.118
- between us and Mexico.
- Oh, no.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.996
H-How could you not
recognize him?

14:15.038 --> 14:17.248
NARRATOR: In fairness
to Lindsay, it was Marky's

14:17.290 --> 14:20.167
face-blindness that led him
to mistake this photo

14:20.209 --> 14:21.419
for the candidate.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.004
Why Lindsay failed to recognize

14:23.046 --> 14:26.883
musical icon Nat King Cole
cannot be explained.

14:26.925 --> 14:28.927
But he's so modern looking.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.678
I mean, obviously I didn't know
it was the man

14:30.720 --> 14:32.764
whose politics
I'm here to protest.

14:32.806 --> 14:33.932
I guess I was just having fun,

14:33.974 --> 14:35.642
pretending I had
my old life back.

14:35.683 --> 14:37.393
Well, we'll just be friends,
and I'm gonna keep it

14:37.435 --> 14:39.980
light and fun with him
and not talk politics at all.

14:40.021 --> 14:42.065
I can't believe
you're such a sellout.

14:42.107 --> 14:44.734
- (sighs) -Are you really going
to whore yourself out like that?

14:44.776 --> 14:46.861
- I am not a whore.
- Yeah, you're a whore.

14:46.903 --> 14:47.779
I am not a whore.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.280
Look, I am still committed
to my ideals

14:49.322 --> 14:51.491
and to my Marky.

14:51.532 --> 14:52.951
MARKY:
Lindsay!

14:52.993 --> 14:54.577
Lindsay, Lindsay!

14:54.619 --> 14:55.954
Well, you certainly have a type.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.580
Lindsay? Have you seen a
woman named Lindsay?

14:57.622 --> 14:58.832
If you see a woman
named Lindsay,

14:58.873 --> 15:01.250
tell her to bail me out.

15:01.292 --> 15:03.086
(gravelly):
I'll do my best, sir.

15:03.128 --> 15:04.170
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

15:04.211 --> 15:05.713
(gravelly):
Taxi.

15:05.755 --> 15:07.214
Tell Lindsay to feed Cindy.

15:07.256 --> 15:08.424
- She thinks she's...
- (in normal voice): Taxi.

15:08.466 --> 15:10.093
(elevator bell dings)

15:10.135 --> 15:13.054
NARRATOR: Lindsay was
as blue as one of her men

15:13.096 --> 15:15.348
when she returned
to the penthouse,

15:15.389 --> 15:18.559
and that's when she decided
to get half in the bag.

15:18.601 --> 15:22.730
- But even though she felt
bad...- (elevator bell dings)

15:22.772 --> 15:25.358
...she was at least able
to turn a man's head...

15:25.399 --> 15:27.027
Gentlemen, start your engines.

15:27.068 --> 15:28.736
...although, perhaps had
his head not turned...

15:28.778 --> 15:30.321
- Buster.
- ...he would have seen

15:30.363 --> 15:31.656
- the ostrich warning
on the door.-No, Gob.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.949
- (ostrich screeches)
- Oh!

15:32.991 --> 15:34.575
NARRATOR:
After another night

15:34.617 --> 15:37.704
in the trailer,
Lindsay went to the model home

15:37.745 --> 15:39.372
to give a daughter
who called her a whore

15:39.413 --> 15:40.832
a piece of her mind.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.126
Hi, sweetie.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.294
Of course, she needed a place
to stay, so she couldn't

15:45.336 --> 15:47.714
- just jump right in.-I thought
I'd surprise you with a visit.

15:47.755 --> 15:49.924
Yeah, well, the bags are
certainly a surprise.

15:49.966 --> 15:51.258
You're not thinking
of moving in, are you?

15:51.300 --> 15:53.260
- What? No.
- Yeah, because

15:53.302 --> 15:54.554
I don't think
Dad would be cool with it.

15:54.595 --> 15:56.014
- No, of course not.
- Yeah.

15:56.056 --> 15:59.059
- Is he in?
- No.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.978
(sighs)
Oh, what happened there?

16:02.020 --> 16:04.564
Kids or people who like kids.

16:04.605 --> 16:06.024
So, where's Marky?

16:06.066 --> 16:09.861
God, Marky will be
in jail for quite a while.

16:09.903 --> 16:11.529
NARRATOR: She actually had just
come from visiting him.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.824
So it, uh, turns out
the glitter was shrapnel grade.

16:14.866 --> 16:16.868
They're upping my charges

16:16.910 --> 16:20.205
from prank bomb
to non-Arab terrorism.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.664
This is where
you letting me out

16:21.706 --> 16:22.790
of the podium
would have really helped.

16:22.832 --> 16:24.209
Why didn't you just come out?

16:24.250 --> 16:26.169
I couldn't do it;
someone locked me in.

16:26.211 --> 16:27.587
NARRATOR:
In fact, it was Gob,

16:27.628 --> 16:30.339
thinking he was trapping
the magician Tony Wonder

16:30.381 --> 16:31.716
into one of his illusions.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.300
GOB:
Hey, Mark, you guys want to see

16:33.342 --> 16:34.594
a real failed magician,
you might want

16:34.635 --> 16:35.678
to get down to the Opies
tonight.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.222
It's going to be hysterical.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.639
MARKY: I need you
to bail me out, Lindsay.

16:38.681 --> 16:40.307
- I need you to use that check.
- Oh, I...

16:40.349 --> 16:41.517
I don't have that check anymore.

16:41.559 --> 16:43.644
- What?
- You told me to rip it up.

16:43.686 --> 16:45.063
I thought you said you
didn't believe in money.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.480
I didn't until I realized
what it could keep me from.

16:46.522 --> 16:48.024
Jail's a lot like Swappigans,

16:48.066 --> 16:50.359
except there's only
one thing to swap.

16:50.401 --> 16:51.652
It's scary.

16:51.694 --> 16:52.946
- GUARD: Anus tart.
- TOBIAS: Yep,

16:52.987 --> 16:55.156
- that's me. -MARKY: Oh, God,
that could have been me.

16:55.198 --> 16:57.242
Lindsay, listen to me--
I'm scared.

16:57.283 --> 16:58.451
I'm scared,
I'm scared, I'm scared.

16:58.492 --> 17:00.161
- I'm really scared.
- GUARD: No touching.

17:00.203 --> 17:01.495
LINDSAY:
Actually it's kind of nice

17:01.537 --> 17:03.206
to have a little me time.

17:03.248 --> 17:05.250
Oh, of course, that's why
you were giving Herbert Love

17:05.290 --> 17:07.417
a little you time last night.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.837
You were flirting with him
to get Marky out of jail.

17:09.878 --> 17:11.380
Well, yeah, that is

17:11.422 --> 17:15.718
what I should have been do--
what I did, yeah, yeah.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.887
That's exactly
what I should have and did do.

17:17.929 --> 17:21.015
And it's not that bad an idea,
actually.

17:21.057 --> 17:22.892
You could get him to do anything
'cause he's probably

17:22.934 --> 17:25.185
just one of those shallow guys
who's only interested in looks.

17:25.228 --> 17:26.854
I miss that.

17:26.896 --> 17:28.106
Missed that.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.440
Yeah, you know,
maybe it would be

17:29.482 --> 17:31.776
a good idea if I got
in touch with him.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.946
I mean, he did give me his card.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.948
Although I could never call him.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.783
I could call him for you

17:38.825 --> 17:41.035
and I'll tell him
it has to be tonight.

17:41.077 --> 17:42.954
Well, the sooner the better.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.122
Got to get Marky out of jail.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.207
That's why the sooner
the better.

17:46.249 --> 17:48.168
NARRATOR: So Maeby arranged
for a meeting

17:48.209 --> 17:50.878
that evening at Hollywood's
exclusive Ealing Club

17:50.920 --> 17:52.922
between Herbert Love
and Cindy Featherbottom.

17:52.964 --> 17:55.175
I like this place.

17:55.216 --> 17:57.718
No cameras, no phones.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.053
Everyone's cool.

17:59.095 --> 18:01.222
Well, thank you
for being willing to meet.

18:01.264 --> 18:02.723
Meet, greet.

18:02.765 --> 18:04.309
Sure are sweet.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.392
What a treat.

18:05.434 --> 18:07.103
What did the lamb say?

18:07.145 --> 18:09.189
Baa?

18:09.230 --> 18:10.190
Bleat.

18:10.231 --> 18:11.565
Ah, yes, of course.

18:11.607 --> 18:12.984
I was just wondering,

18:13.026 --> 18:15.111
is anything really bad going
to happen

18:15.153 --> 18:17.488
to that blue guy from the rally?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.531
Do you want to press charges?

18:18.572 --> 18:20.200
Who can think of Little Boy Blue

18:20.241 --> 18:23.203
- when I've got this beautiful
face in front of me? -Oh.

18:23.244 --> 18:26.122
Thanks, haven't heard that
in a long time.

18:26.164 --> 18:28.499
Your cheekbones are even higher
than my approval rating.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.960
Your brain can register
my cheekbones?

18:31.002 --> 18:32.586
I'll register 'em to vote.

18:32.628 --> 18:35.048
- (laughs) -Your lips are
like a Murphy bed.

18:35.089 --> 18:36.216
They don't take up much space,

18:36.257 --> 18:38.301
but they are there
when you need 'em.

18:38.343 --> 18:42.347
Okay, you are a poet.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.474
You're wonderful.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.434
But, um, yeah,
I-I do want to talk

18:47.476 --> 18:49.187
to you about a couple of issues.

18:49.229 --> 18:53.607
Can we just have one night where
we don't talk about politics?

18:53.649 --> 18:56.443
Yes, yes, just one night.

18:56.485 --> 18:58.112
- We deserve it.
- Let's get a room.

18:58.154 --> 18:59.322
Yes-- no.

18:59.364 --> 19:00.323
What?

19:00.365 --> 19:02.408
Uh, I... okay.

19:02.449 --> 19:04.035
We can talk in a room, I guess.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.828
(elevator bell dings)

19:05.870 --> 19:08.039
NARRATOR: And later,
down in the lobby, as Herbert

19:08.081 --> 19:09.832
went off to do some business...

19:09.874 --> 19:11.458
You hang tight.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.212
I'm going to meet with some
of my, uh, "constititutes."

19:14.254 --> 19:15.504
...Lindsay ran
into her brother Michael.

19:15.546 --> 19:17.257
- Hi-lo.
- Michael?

19:17.298 --> 19:18.341
Hi.

19:18.383 --> 19:19.926
- How are you?
- Oh, good, good.

19:19.967 --> 19:21.261
I almost didn't recognize you.

19:21.302 --> 19:22.845
- It's my hair.
- That's some of it,

19:22.887 --> 19:24.597
but it's also, you're with a guy

19:24.638 --> 19:26.891
that pretty much represents
everything you pretend to hate.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.601
- Was that Herbert Love?
- Great, now I remember

19:28.642 --> 19:30.186
why we fell out of touch.

19:30.228 --> 19:32.272
No, Lindsay, I'm kidding,
kidding, kidding, I'm so sorry.

19:32.313 --> 19:33.731
I'm sure that you're having
a great influence

19:33.773 --> 19:35.358
on him, you know.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.943
(chuckling):
Thanks.

19:36.984 --> 19:39.737
But if you really want
to blow him-- away,

19:39.779 --> 19:43.449
you know the wall issue
that everyone is talking about?

19:43.490 --> 19:45.326
The wall between Mexico
and the U.S.?

19:45.368 --> 19:46.702
Tell him to take it down?

19:46.744 --> 19:49.122
Or just not to put it up.
No wall yet.

19:49.163 --> 19:51.207
Oh, no, there's no--
I knew that, yeah.

19:51.249 --> 19:53.000
If you could get him

19:53.042 --> 19:55.128
against the wall, Lindsay...

19:55.169 --> 19:57.463
Well, I had no idea you were
this socially conscious.

19:57.504 --> 19:59.299
NARRATOR:
He wasn't.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.675
In fact, he was just using
her Love connection

20:01.717 --> 20:04.470
to make good
on a deal he'd struck

20:04.511 --> 20:06.597
to get
his father's movie rights.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.016
Can you help me,
then, with Love?

20:09.058 --> 20:11.144
Of course I will.

20:12.853 --> 20:14.855
If you do something for me.

20:14.897 --> 20:16.399
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

20:16.441 --> 20:18.567
I would like to use your
membership at the Balboa Club.

20:18.609 --> 20:20.320
The girl
I've been telling you about--

20:20.361 --> 20:22.738
she likes nice things, and
if everything goes well tonight,

20:22.780 --> 20:24.657
I think I may want
to take her out

20:24.698 --> 20:25.658
for a nice dinner.

20:25.699 --> 20:27.660
You really like this girl?

20:27.701 --> 20:29.829
- She's Tracey.
- Oh.

20:29.870 --> 20:33.082
Fat Tracey
or thin Tracey at the end?

20:33.124 --> 20:35.209
I think, just on this,
you owe me the membership.

20:35.251 --> 20:36.669
You know,
we're kind of maxed out

20:36.710 --> 20:38.838
at the club,
but if you show them my card,

20:38.879 --> 20:43.550
I'm sure they won't turn you
away at the door.

20:43.592 --> 20:45.636
You'd do this for me?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.138
I will if you...

20:47.180 --> 20:49.640
- Yeah, sure, fine.
- Yeah?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.892
Yeah, I'll talk to him
about the wall.

20:51.934 --> 20:53.978
- Good. -I mean,
I want to change politics.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.314
- Great.
- What's in it for me?

20:56.356 --> 20:58.107
So not completely change them?

20:58.149 --> 20:59.317
(chuckles)
What do you want?

20:59.359 --> 21:00.567
Well, actually

21:00.609 --> 21:02.028
I want you to talk
to that warden guy

21:02.069 --> 21:03.904
about getting my boyfriend out

21:03.946 --> 21:06.366
'cause I really don't think
Herbert's gonna help with that.

21:06.407 --> 21:08.326
Well, I have a script notes call
with him on Tuesday.

21:09.952 --> 21:11.871
- Yeah, I'll talk to Warden
Gentles. -Great, thank you.

21:11.912 --> 21:13.247
This is good.

21:13.289 --> 21:15.124
- Of course.
- Glad we ran into each other.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.417
If you do something for me.

21:16.459 --> 21:18.794
I'm making this movie and I need
everybody's rights.

21:18.836 --> 21:20.963
NARRATOR:
And that's how Lindsay agreed

21:21.005 --> 21:23.549
- to give Michael her rights for
his movie.-I'll do it. -Great.

21:23.590 --> 21:24.884
Thanks.

21:24.925 --> 21:26.469
That's it.

21:26.511 --> 21:28.429
NARRATOR:
But it shouldn't have been

21:28.471 --> 21:30.681
because he should have asked
for help getting into a club

21:30.723 --> 21:33.434
he was about to discover
was members only.

21:33.476 --> 21:35.186
- This is a membership place,
huh? -It is,

21:35.228 --> 21:36.812
- yes, members only. -Yeah,
I'm meeting my son up there.

21:36.854 --> 21:39.148
Maybe he's already up there.
Could you maybe page him

21:39.190 --> 21:41.401
- up there?-And when
the page proved fruitless...

21:41.442 --> 21:43.444
If you'd like
to have a seat and wait...

21:43.486 --> 21:46.197
You're gonna make me look like
a big shot in front of my son.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.448
And when the page
proved fruitless,

21:47.490 --> 21:50.034
Michael decided to head
George Michael off

21:50.076 --> 21:53.287
before he could get to the
club's lobby with a small lie.

21:53.329 --> 21:54.872
Hey, buddy, it's Dad.

21:54.914 --> 21:58.042
Um, I am having real trouble
getting up there.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.545
Uh, this traffic
is unbelievable.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.547
NARRATOR: Which led
to a slightly bigger lie...

22:02.588 --> 22:05.966
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

22:06.008 --> 22:07.968
- You know?-... and then some
effort to make it foolproof.

22:08.010 --> 22:10.555
Um, and, uh, the kicker
is that there's no news crew.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.849
I mean, I guess they can't get
in either 'cause of the traffic,

22:13.891 --> 22:15.726
so no one's going
to be able to see this.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.810
NARRATOR:
But perhaps,

22:16.852 --> 22:18.645
had Michael not have lied,

22:18.687 --> 22:21.441
he wouldn't have felt
suspicious when, moments later,

22:21.482 --> 22:23.192
- he received a return call
from his son...-You know what?

22:23.234 --> 22:25.152
I bet we're sitting
in the exact same traffic.

22:25.194 --> 22:28.114
- This is a mess.-... canceling
the get-together entirely.

22:28.155 --> 22:30.908
Oh, God, they're forcing us off.
Oh, they're closing the lanes.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.035
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
in Herbert's hotel room,

22:33.077 --> 22:34.619
Lindsay was worried she was

22:34.661 --> 22:36.956
too quickly abandoning
her principles.

22:36.997 --> 22:39.083
Wait... I can't do this

22:39.125 --> 22:42.420
unless you promise
to be against the wall.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.338
What the hell?

22:44.380 --> 22:45.590
It's better for my back anyway.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.799
Thank you.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.384
NARRATOR:
Although technically

22:48.426 --> 22:50.428
that was one
of Michael's principles.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.471
LINDSAY:
Well...

22:51.512 --> 22:53.306
That was so not quick.

22:53.347 --> 22:54.265
(chuckles)

22:54.307 --> 22:55.349
Well, I paid for six hours.

22:55.391 --> 22:57.059
I want to get my money's worth.

22:57.101 --> 22:58.643
Imagine what would have happened
if you had the room

22:58.685 --> 22:59.979
for the whole night.

23:00.020 --> 23:01.564
Oh, I got it
for the whole month.

23:01.606 --> 23:03.608
You crack me up.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.485
God, can you believe
this is happening?

23:05.526 --> 23:07.820
I mean, we're such opposites
and yet we're so in synch.

23:07.861 --> 23:10.864
- It's like we finish
each other's... -Sandwiches?

23:10.906 --> 23:13.367
What's the point of raising
funds if I'm eating sandwiches?

23:13.409 --> 23:15.786
- (murmurs)
- I got something for you.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.871
(chuckling):
Oh, really?

23:17.913 --> 23:20.374
(gasping)

23:20.416 --> 23:22.960
NARRATOR: And perhaps it was
the heart that made her wonder

23:23.002 --> 23:26.964
if Herbert was the Love the
Four Seasons shaman spoke of.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.343
When love is near,
your heart will be happy.

23:30.384 --> 23:31.552
HERBERT:
This way

23:31.594 --> 23:34.805
you'll always have a little Love
near your heart.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.849
(mystical chanting)

23:36.890 --> 23:39.018
- Aah, Jesus Christ!
- Oh!

23:39.059 --> 23:40.311
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you do that?

23:40.353 --> 23:42.021
No, I thought it was cute,
I saw it in a movie.

23:42.062 --> 23:43.189
- Okay?
- Okay, okay, great, thank you.

23:43.230 --> 23:44.773
Oh, I feel so special.

23:44.815 --> 23:46.025
You are special.

23:46.066 --> 23:47.818
NARRATOR:
Lindsay wasn't special,

23:47.860 --> 23:50.655
but he'd gotten
the necklaces on special.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.072
LINDSAY:
So, when can I see you

23:52.114 --> 23:53.782
- again?
- The only way

23:53.824 --> 23:56.869
we can see each other is
if you work for my campaign.

23:56.910 --> 24:00.498
You are going to be
my key advisor.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.042
NARRATOR: She would be enacting
social change after all.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.627
I would like that very much.

24:04.669 --> 24:05.794
(Herbert chuckles)

24:05.836 --> 24:06.920
She's going to need a key
to my room,

24:06.962 --> 24:10.007
and I'd advise you to use it
when I call you.

24:13.093 --> 24:15.179
NARRATOR: Since Herbert couldn't
officially spend money

24:15.221 --> 24:16.847
on Lindsay, and Lindsay
hadn't told Herbert

24:16.889 --> 24:18.765
- who she really was...
- Uh, why don't you go

24:18.807 --> 24:20.434
- make the rounds, and, uh,
I'll get us checked in. -Okay.

24:20.476 --> 24:21.977
...Lindsay had to pay
for dinner

24:22.019 --> 24:23.646
- the way she always had...
- Uh, Bluth.

24:23.688 --> 24:25.981
- I made a reservation.
- ...by secretly putting it

24:26.023 --> 24:27.525
- on her family tab.
- Hi-lo. Nice to meet you.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.109
Oh, I'm sorry,
the Bluths have been seated.

24:29.151 --> 24:30.944
But she wasn't the only Bluth

24:30.986 --> 24:32.613
pretending to be something
they weren't that night.

24:32.655 --> 24:35.658
Who's the cheap redhead?

24:35.700 --> 24:38.244
Well, hello.

24:38.285 --> 24:39.620
Hello.

24:39.662 --> 24:40.829
Indeed.

24:40.871 --> 24:43.165
Look at you.
What are you doing here?

24:43.207 --> 24:45.834
I need the membership. I'm
taking my boss out to dinner.

24:45.876 --> 24:47.752
It's too late. I already made
a deal with Dad for it.

24:47.794 --> 24:50.047
This is why I had to ask you
for the in with Herbert Love.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.007
Exactly, and that's why
you are leaving,

24:52.049 --> 24:53.967
and I'm going to stay because
I'm the one who did the favor.

24:54.009 --> 24:55.886
I got Love against the wall.
Plus I've got to impress him.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.013
He's making me part
of his campaign.

24:58.055 --> 24:59.764
I'm sorry, there seems
to have been a mix-up.

24:59.806 --> 25:01.475
- A merry one.
- Oh.

25:01.517 --> 25:04.103
A merry one. I already paid you
back for the favor when

25:04.144 --> 25:06.188
I talked to the warden about
getting Marky out of prison.

25:06.230 --> 25:07.607
LINDSAY:
Oh, God, not now.

25:07.648 --> 25:09.316
- When?
- I don't know, but listen.

25:09.358 --> 25:10.901
I haven't been on a date
in a very, very long time,

25:10.943 --> 25:12.403
and she's already going out
with Ron Howard

25:12.445 --> 25:13.778
so I need to impress her.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.489
Actually,
it was Ron's daughter,

25:15.531 --> 25:17.074
but Michael still didn't
know that.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.452
Great to see you.
And you look so good.

25:19.493 --> 25:20.703
So do you.
I do hate the campaign,

25:20.745 --> 25:22.955
okay, but I'm changing him.

25:22.996 --> 25:24.290
I'm his key advisor.

25:24.331 --> 25:25.999
Although without an office,

25:26.041 --> 25:28.461
she was forced to advise him
in the back of his limo.

25:28.502 --> 25:30.921
And soon she was advising him
all over town.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.673
LINDSAY:
And he respect me for it.

25:32.715 --> 25:34.258
He respects me for who I am.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.009
So does mine.
Listen, we'll share it, okay?

25:36.051 --> 25:37.720
- Okay.
- Got it? Great.

25:37.762 --> 25:39.639
Oh! My name
is Cindy Featherbottom.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.974
Right. Oh, and I-I used to be
a real estate tycoon,

25:42.015 --> 25:43.808
now I'm an impressive producer.
Got it?

25:43.850 --> 25:45.102
- Got it.
- Eat light.

25:45.144 --> 25:48.105
This is my date.
This is Rebel Alley.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.856
Oh, and my boss, Herbert Love.

25:49.898 --> 25:52.067
- Hi-lo.
- Hi-lo?

25:52.109 --> 25:53.986
Just like your plan
to hurt the poor.

25:54.027 --> 25:56.739
I thought that was about
neglecting the poor.

25:56.781 --> 25:58.907
I guess the special tonight
is red snapper.

25:58.949 --> 26:00.951
How do you know this woman?

26:02.119 --> 26:06.499
Uh, she is... um...

26:08.668 --> 26:10.210
- I just, I mean...
- (Lindsay laughs)

26:10.252 --> 26:12.045
- High school.
- Brother and sister.

26:12.087 --> 26:13.673
We can't be brother-sister--
she knows about the family.

26:13.714 --> 26:15.716
- We don't.
- Just met.

26:15.758 --> 26:17.510
Yeah, so, but let's eat.

26:17.551 --> 26:19.219
NARRATOR: And that's how Lindsay
found herself

26:19.261 --> 26:22.640
on a very awkward double date
with her brother.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.643
Is everybody's food as delicious
as my side salad?

26:25.685 --> 26:27.812
And a couple of glasses
of white wine in,

26:27.852 --> 26:30.564
Rebel started to espouse
her liberal agenda.

26:30.606 --> 26:32.566
It's just a little hard to sit
two feet away from someone

26:32.608 --> 26:35.194
who doesn't believe in paying
for a woman's contraception.

26:35.235 --> 26:38.280
Well, to be fair, no,
he does pay for the room.

26:38.322 --> 26:41.116
Is there anything better than
the great American scallop?

26:41.158 --> 26:43.369
Look how he changes the subject.

26:43.410 --> 26:45.705
Aren't you glad your teenager's
not here to see this?

26:45.746 --> 26:47.122
You have a teenager?

26:47.164 --> 26:49.291
I'm a movie prod...

26:49.333 --> 26:51.210
Movie producer.

26:51.251 --> 26:53.629
Producing a movie right now--
Rebel's in it

26:53.671 --> 26:55.964
- for Imagine Entertainment.
- Oh!

26:56.006 --> 26:57.882
Is that Ron Howard's company?

26:57.924 --> 26:59.677
- Uh, yeah.
- Yes.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.012
I don't want to be the one
to say it, but I hate that guy.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.889
He's just another Hollywood
liberal big shot.

27:04.931 --> 27:07.267
Oh. There are a lot of those
Ron Howards out there

27:07.309 --> 27:08.853
that do abuse their power,

27:08.893 --> 27:11.480
but I will tell you, sir,
that I do not do that.

27:11.522 --> 27:15.359
Well, don't you have to have
power to abuse the power?

27:15.401 --> 27:18.070
Um, I am not going to sit here
and defend Ron Howard

27:18.111 --> 27:21.866
to someone who's never achieved
half of what he's achieved.

27:21.906 --> 27:23.283
Are you saying that to him
or to me?

27:23.325 --> 27:24.535
I forgot how touchy

27:24.577 --> 27:26.119
these Hollywood people can be.

27:26.161 --> 27:29.206
Oh, I'm not. I'm not.
Are you saying that I am?

27:29.248 --> 27:30.708
Maybe Ron Howard is,
but I-I mean, I don't know.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.917
But I'm not.
And I am also not

27:32.959 --> 27:34.754
one of those Beverly Hills
billionaires

27:34.795 --> 27:36.296
who can't go two minutes without
putting his phone to his...

27:36.338 --> 27:39.924
I got to take this.
Hold on one second. Hello?

27:39.966 --> 27:42.511
Hey, George Michael.
You stuck in traffic, pal?

27:42.553 --> 27:44.764
No, I just feel terrible
that we couldn't get together

27:44.805 --> 27:46.682
the other night and, uh,
I miss you, you know.

27:46.724 --> 27:48.726
But I'm free all night
if you wanted...

27:48.768 --> 27:50.436
- Well... listen, I-I...-But
Michael was still stinging...

27:50.477 --> 27:52.312
I'm in the middle
of a film meeting...

27:52.354 --> 27:54.022
...over his son not making it
to the Ealing Club...

27:54.064 --> 27:57.025
I've got these people in
politics involved and I just...

27:57.067 --> 28:00.320
You know, I can't get away
this time, you know. Maybe...

28:00.362 --> 28:03.532
...even though Michael
had lied to him about it first.

28:03.574 --> 28:04.949
You know, just,
I'm a super busy guy.

28:04.991 --> 28:06.619
- And back at the table...
- So...

28:06.660 --> 28:08.621
I can't believe that a woman
would support this guy.

28:08.662 --> 28:10.456
...Lindsay found herself
torn...

28:10.497 --> 28:13.793
And I assume by being with him,
you just parrot his values.

28:13.834 --> 28:16.128
- ...between who she was
with...-I don't appreciate you

28:16.169 --> 28:17.421
saying that, okay?

28:17.463 --> 28:19.256
I have my own values, Rebel,

28:19.298 --> 28:21.592
and believe it or not, they're
closer to yours than you think.

28:21.634 --> 28:23.260
...and who she wanted to be.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.638
'Cause I do appreciate
you saying that.

28:25.679 --> 28:28.390
But what do I know? I'm just
some shallow Hollywood...

28:28.432 --> 28:30.726
Oh, God, I've got to get this.

28:30.768 --> 28:32.977
It could be my agent.
Hello?

28:33.019 --> 28:35.355
HERBERT:
Now that is one redhead

28:35.397 --> 28:37.566
I do not want to have
sexual relations with.

28:37.608 --> 28:38.943
(laughing)

28:38.984 --> 28:41.779
- Well...
- So... are we having dessert?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.572
- No.
- No. Uh-uh.

28:43.614 --> 28:45.157
Well, I don't want to be the one
to say it,

28:45.198 --> 28:47.033
but if we are not going
to have dessert,

28:47.075 --> 28:50.036
- then I think I am going
to leave. -Oh, no.

28:50.078 --> 28:52.665
But-but we're going to discuss
those new positions tonight.

28:52.706 --> 28:54.750
Wasn't that the plan?

28:54.792 --> 28:56.919
I think the best position for me
to be in tonight

28:56.961 --> 28:58.671
is with my wife,

28:58.712 --> 29:01.089
and tomorrow I'm taking my wife
and children

29:01.131 --> 29:04.176
to see the beautiful
American ocean.

29:04.217 --> 29:07.429
(diners applauding)

29:10.390 --> 29:12.643
Lindsay started rethinking
her new life and that's when

29:12.685 --> 29:14.770
she ran into the man
from her old one.

29:14.812 --> 29:17.356
- Marky?
- Lindsay?

29:17.397 --> 29:18.941
- Oh, Lindsay.
- Marky.

29:18.983 --> 29:21.902
I did it.
I beat the system.

29:21.944 --> 29:23.278
I got out my way.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.405
I thought my brother asked
Warden Gentles

29:25.447 --> 29:27.658
- to get you out.
- No, I mean from the Dumpster.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.368
You wouldn't believe the
scallops they're throwing

29:29.409 --> 29:31.829
away here, but I got out
of that Dumpster my way.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.747
I've really missed you.

29:33.789 --> 29:36.458
Yeah, I missed you, too.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.961
I feel like I really lost my way
for a while.

29:39.003 --> 29:40.629
Me, too.
It's almost like

29:40.671 --> 29:43.883
maybe we shouldn't skip town
after this next one.

29:43.924 --> 29:46.301
Next one? Another paint bomb?

29:46.343 --> 29:48.012
No, a real one.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.973
On the Cinco de Cuatro,
Love's boat is going to...

29:51.015 --> 29:53.684
- Sink-o.
- ...go into the... Yes, sink-o.

29:53.726 --> 29:55.101
See, the coast guard is going
to be busy that night,

29:55.143 --> 29:56.770
so after it's done, we slip away

29:56.812 --> 29:59.940
and make our way down to Mexico
and reunite with Mom.

29:59.982 --> 30:01.567
I just have to find a boat
that won't get chorizo

30:01.608 --> 30:04.028
- caught in the propeller.
- Lindsay was torn.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.071
Her head was with Marky...

30:06.112 --> 30:08.824
but it was Love who was close
to her heart.

30:08.866 --> 30:12.828
So the next night at Cinco,
she felt she had no choice

30:12.870 --> 30:14.997
- but to betray one
- Herbert.

30:15.039 --> 30:16.874
- to protect the other.
- Hi. Um, listen.

30:16.916 --> 30:20.210
I'm here undercover because
I have some inside information

30:20.252 --> 30:22.462
that you really need
to know about.

30:22.504 --> 30:24.006
But as it turned out,
Herbert had

30:24.048 --> 30:26.633
some undercover information
for her, too.

30:26.675 --> 30:29.177
I cannot be under the covers
with you anymore.

30:29.219 --> 30:30.930
It's over between us.

30:30.971 --> 30:34.140
My wife found out and I told her
there was nothing emotional,

30:34.182 --> 30:35.392
that you were just a prostitute.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.186
- I'm not a prostitute.
- Oh, I know, I know.

30:38.228 --> 30:39.772
The point is, we are through.

30:39.813 --> 30:41.023
Here's a little
severance package

30:41.065 --> 30:42.733
for servicing my package.

30:42.775 --> 30:45.569
Lindsay tried to throw
the money in his face,

30:45.611 --> 30:48.488
but she didn't have
the muscle memory for it.

30:49.573 --> 30:51.241
- She's keeping it.
- Oh, good.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.910
And don't forget to vote.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.411
This isn't over.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.747
I'm not some taco
you can throw into the bay.

30:56.789 --> 30:58.707
(grunts)

30:58.749 --> 31:01.585
- Lindsay wanted to get back
- I can't do this.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.087
at Love...

31:03.128 --> 31:05.881
but not by blowing him up

31:05.923 --> 31:09.426
and heading to Mexico to be
with Marky's awful mother.

31:09.468 --> 31:14.014
And that's when she ran into
her own awful mother.

31:14.056 --> 31:16.349
Mom. What are you doing here?

31:16.391 --> 31:18.393
Lindsay.
I thought you were a hooker.

31:18.435 --> 31:20.479
- Again.
- It's a wig.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.022
No one recognizes me in it.

31:22.064 --> 31:23.607
Oh, I recognized you.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.317
Let me rephrase that
more kindly.

31:25.358 --> 31:29.154
I hear you're hooking now
with Herbert Love.

31:29.195 --> 31:30.823
- It's called hooking up.
- Oh.

31:30.864 --> 31:32.950
And, yeah,
I got a little sidetracked,

31:32.992 --> 31:35.494
but I know who I am now.

31:35.535 --> 31:37.329
I'm back to being
severely liberal.

31:37.370 --> 31:38.872
Well, like I said,

31:38.914 --> 31:40.624
the one time you were nice
enough to visit me,

31:40.666 --> 31:42.459
you are who you are--

31:42.501 --> 31:44.628
a blonde, waspy
Orange County princess

31:44.670 --> 31:46.755
who doesn't care about anything
but herself

31:46.797 --> 31:48.674
and that's okay.

31:48.715 --> 31:50.759
Ah, sarcasm.

31:50.801 --> 31:55.180
No, I'm a Bluth
and so are you.

31:55.221 --> 31:57.933
You really know
how to twist the knife.

31:57.975 --> 32:00.226
But you are right about
one thing.

32:00.268 --> 32:01.854
Lindsay was done
pretending to be red.

32:01.895 --> 32:04.523
I don't need this anymore.

32:04.564 --> 32:05.983
And she decided the best way
to get back

32:06.025 --> 32:08.443
at her mother
and Herbert Love

32:08.485 --> 32:11.237
was by working
for their mutual rival.

32:11.279 --> 32:14.074
Lucille 2.
I've got great news.

32:14.116 --> 32:17.369
I'm finally available to become
your campaign manager.

32:17.410 --> 32:19.038
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

32:19.079 --> 32:22.415
But I found someone
more qualified than you.

32:22.457 --> 32:23.917
Hello, Lindsay.

32:23.959 --> 32:26.294
Sally.

32:26.336 --> 32:27.713
It was Sally Sitwell, a woman

32:27.754 --> 32:28.964
who'd long been
Lindsay's rival.

32:29.006 --> 32:31.299
- It's been a while.
- Mm.

32:31.341 --> 32:33.593
How is she more qualified
than me?

32:33.635 --> 32:35.137
She has integrity.

32:35.179 --> 32:36.346
And look at this hair.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.140
Look at this beautiful,
long hair.

32:39.432 --> 32:41.560
I made you a banner.

32:41.601 --> 32:43.353
Look, I can really help
this campaign.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.731
You already have,
more than you know.

32:45.772 --> 32:49.401
- Now, give her a little
show-and-tell. -Mm.

32:49.442 --> 32:50.652
Show-and-tell?

32:50.694 --> 32:52.779
Oh, she just means
these photos

32:52.821 --> 32:55.824
of Herbert Love
with a mystery redhead

32:55.866 --> 32:57.492
he's cheating on his wife with.

32:57.534 --> 32:59.078
Who took these?

32:59.119 --> 33:00.829
The first two were taken
by the security camera

33:00.871 --> 33:02.998
in the Albertsons parking lot.

33:03.040 --> 33:06.085
And the third was left in the
photo booth at the Ealing Club.

33:06.126 --> 33:08.962
- God, that was a photo booth?
- Mm-hmm.

33:09.004 --> 33:11.339
No one can know about this.

33:11.381 --> 33:13.299
Oh, I'm afraid
they're going to.

33:13.341 --> 33:16.678
Lucille has copies-- she wants
to go viral with this.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.097
Herbert Love with his hooker?

33:18.138 --> 33:20.099
She'll win for sure.

33:20.140 --> 33:21.600
I can't let her do that.

33:21.641 --> 33:24.770
I don't think you can stop her.

33:24.811 --> 33:26.855
Anyway, it was so great
running into you again.

33:26.897 --> 33:28.690
- Mwah!
- Lindsay was horrified

33:28.732 --> 33:30.817
that the world would view her

33:30.859 --> 33:32.485
- as Love's prostitute.
- Vote for Love. Vote for Love.

33:32.527 --> 33:34.320
And then Lindsay ran into
someone else

33:34.362 --> 33:35.989
- who was looking for Love.
- David. -Who are you?

33:36.031 --> 33:37.199
I'm Cindy Featherbottom.

33:37.241 --> 33:38.825
I've been looking for you.

33:38.867 --> 33:40.827
Love's gone missing
and I've got to find someone

33:40.869 --> 33:43.496
to jump onto that stage
and to show everyone here

33:43.538 --> 33:46.917
that we are the party
that has complete con-con...

33:46.959 --> 33:48.752
Complete con-con-con...

33:48.794 --> 33:50.295
- con-con... Complete...
- ...trol?

33:50.336 --> 33:51.880
Giant. ...trol.

33:51.922 --> 33:54.049
And that's when Lindsay
found an opportunity...

33:54.091 --> 33:56.468
- I'll do it.
- to put a spin on the looming

33:56.509 --> 33:58.137
- photos scandal.-Oh, my God,
thank you, thank you.

33:58.178 --> 34:00.264
And I'm so sorry about
that giant crack earlier.

34:00.305 --> 34:04.601
Okay, raise the mics, everybody!
New speaker!

34:04.643 --> 34:06.103
So, like many before her,

34:06.145 --> 34:09.022
Lindsay would accuse
Herbert Love...

34:09.063 --> 34:10.690
Can I have everyone's attention?

34:10.732 --> 34:13.318
...of sexual harassment.

34:13.359 --> 34:16.112
I am Herbert Love's
"key advisor."

34:16.155 --> 34:18.197
(crowd cheering)

34:18.239 --> 34:19.866
Uh, thank you, but...

34:19.908 --> 34:21.493
But first she had to turn
his supporters against him.

34:21.534 --> 34:23.578
Listen, I have a few things
I'd like to tell you

34:23.620 --> 34:25.289
about Herbert Love.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.083
Love wants to put up a wall.

34:28.125 --> 34:29.751
- (cheering)
- No, no.

34:29.793 --> 34:32.254
I mean, not just any wall.

34:32.295 --> 34:35.799
A wall to keep out the Mexicans.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.176
(cheering)

34:37.217 --> 34:40.179
Oh, wow,
what a great crowd, uh...

34:40.219 --> 34:41.429
And that's when
the blowback began.

34:41.471 --> 34:44.016
- Checkmate!
- (angry shouting)

34:44.056 --> 34:46.268
- (crowd cheering)
- But no, you don't understand.

34:46.310 --> 34:48.312
He wants to separate...

34:48.353 --> 34:50.063
Oh! (screams)

34:50.105 --> 34:52.649
- Viva MÃ©jico.
- That's my necklace.

34:52.690 --> 34:56.902
(angry shouting, clattering)

34:56.945 --> 34:58.697
What-what's going on?

34:58.738 --> 35:01.033
The marauders, lady,
a bunch of young Mexicans--

35:01.074 --> 35:02.242
they're taking over
Cinco de Cuatro.

35:02.284 --> 35:04.036
They don't find it funny
anymore.

35:04.077 --> 35:07.372
But that was my necklace.
I mean... God.

35:07.413 --> 35:10.416
They don't belong here,
we belong here.

35:10.458 --> 35:13.670
(cheering)

35:13.712 --> 35:17.382
I mean,
someone should put up a wall.

35:17.423 --> 35:19.009
But that's when Lindsay
found herself

35:19.051 --> 35:20.552
- saying this...
- Yeah.

35:20.593 --> 35:22.679
We should put up a wall.

35:22.721 --> 35:26.308
- Put up this wall.
- (cheering)

35:26.350 --> 35:29.602
Put... up... this wall.

35:29.644 --> 35:33.398
ALL (chanting):
Put up this wall!

35:33.439 --> 35:35.608
...which was originally
her mother's idea.

35:35.650 --> 35:38.904
Although it was horrible news
for her father.

35:38.945 --> 35:41.073
- Put up this wall!
- And that's when Lindsay

35:41.114 --> 35:43.116
found out who she really was.

35:43.158 --> 35:48.247
My name is Lindsay Bluth,
and this is who I am.

35:48.288 --> 35:50.665
A Bluth, just like her mother.

35:50.707 --> 35:53.418
She's a game changer.

35:53.459 --> 35:55.628
(crowd cheering)

35:58.423 --> 36:01.051
Herbert Love is discovered
in a coma.

36:01.093 --> 36:03.011
They think it happened
during the blowback.

36:03.053 --> 36:04.930
They found him behind
the Kick a Goat.

36:04.971 --> 36:08.100
The doctors say he may come out
of it in a week to ten years.

36:08.141 --> 36:09.684
So I have one question for you.

36:09.726 --> 36:11.477
- Would you consider...
- Yes.

36:11.519 --> 36:13.521
- Would you consider... -Yes.

36:13.563 --> 36:15.315
- Would you consider...
- Yes.

36:15.357 --> 36:17.442
Would you consider running
in his place?

36:18.526 --> 36:20.320
- Yes.
- Fantastic.

36:20.362 --> 36:22.114
Sweetheart,
could you work his thumb?

36:22.155 --> 36:24.574
And she even gets
Herbert's endorsement.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.243
And Annyong tries to stick

36:26.285 --> 36:28.494
the Bluth family
for a tomato juice

36:28.536 --> 36:30.663
that costs him $700

36:30.705 --> 36:33.250
and ultimately his freedom.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.085
Good-bye, Annyong.
