00:07.874 --> 00:10.744

Well, you are having
an affair with her husband

00:10.744 --> 00:13.413

You know what?
Debbie is history.

00:21.921 --> 00:25.058

How long does it take debbie
to throw in a load of laundry?

01:06.599 --> 01:08.101
I really need to talk to her.

01:08.101 --> 01:09.936
She should be right up.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.888
Debbie said you were gonna "hey!"

01:12.388 --> 01:14.441
No, we were not.

01:14.441 --> 01:15.892
It was a trick.

01:15.892 --> 01:19.896
Is $300 too much for a hot wheels v.w.
Purple evil weevil?

01:21.397 --> 01:22.899
[Sighs]

01:22.899 --> 01:25.068
Yeah, i could use one, too
.

01:25.068 --> 01:27.570
Damn. The ebay auction closed.

01:28.071 --> 01:29.572
I lost my weevil.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.495
Dang it. Can i get a light off yours?

01:37.881 --> 01:39.382
Huh, that's a funny-looking cigarette.

01:39.382 --> 01:41.384
You roll it yourself?

01:41.384 --> 01:42.218
[Holding breath]
Yeah.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.673
You got a weak flame
on this thing.

[Inhales]

01:48.675 --> 01:50.176
[Coughing]

01:50.176 --> 01:52.562
This isn't one of them
clove cigarettes, is it?

01:52.562 --> 01:54.931
No, man. That's
the chronic from mexico.

01:54.931 --> 01:56.900
Damn n.a.f.t.a

01:56.900 --> 01:58.902
It's clearly an inferior tobacco.

01:58.902 --> 02:00.904
So, does your wife party, too?

02:00.904 --> 02:02.405
Party?

02:02.405 --> 02:05.408
Uh, we throw a party

02:19.672 --> 02:22.509
now, you heard the gunshot
at 6:45, was it?

02:22.509 --> 02:24.427
That is correct, sheriff.
Mmm-hmm.

02:24.427 --> 02:27.297
And you discovered
the body at 6:47?

02:27.297 --> 02:28.715
Most of it, yes.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.216
So let me get this straight.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.218
Debbie was mr. Strickland's mistress.

02:32.218 --> 02:34.721
and her murdered body
was found at the same plac

02:35.221 --> 02:36.723
where mr. Strickland
and his wife

02:36.723 --> 02:38.975
just got done
reconciling their differences.

02:38.975 --> 02:40.977
Uh-huh. My husband han
k set that up.

02:41.477 --> 02:43.696
Well, the reconciliation,
not--not the murder.

02:43.696 --> 02:44.697
Mmm.

02:46.816 --> 02:48.818
[Retching]

[continues gagging]

03:03.166 --> 03:06.169
Oh, no. My eyes
are turnin' bloodshot.

03:06.169 --> 03:07.637
I'm goin' on a trip.

03:07.637 --> 03:09.422

03:41.454 --> 03:43.790
Miz liz.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.792
I think i got my first suspect.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.343
I could send that up to dallas,

03:47.343 --> 03:48.928
have my boys run it for prints.

03:48.928 --> 03:52.432
Oh, who in the hell
called in the texas rangers?

03:52.432 --> 03:54.934
A mrs. Peggy hill,
restauranteur.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.887
I love your show!
I love that walker!

04:00.106 --> 04:01.608
[Sighs]

04:01.608 --> 04:04.110
[Panting]
How long was i sleepin'?

04:04.110 --> 04:06.112
Why--why am i running?

04:06.112 --> 04:08.615
Oh, god! I'm talking to myself.

04:08.615 --> 04:11.117
That's a side effect
of the marijuana poisoning

04:12.619 --> 04:14.621
dad! Dad!

04:14.621 --> 04:17.123
The police are
lookin' for you!

04:17.123 --> 04:19.125
Oh, no. Debbie's
hippie roommate

04:19.125 --> 04:21.628
turned me in
for smoking narcotics.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.881
(peggy)
Hank!

04:25.882 --> 04:26.883
[Clears throat]

04:29.218 --> 04:30.720
[Van engine starts]

04:31.971 --> 04:34.474
debbie's dead?
Oh, i was just in her-

04:34.474 --> 04:37.977
i--i mean, i just talked to her,
uh, a-at work.

04:37.977 --> 04:41.814
Oh, it was awful. I saw her
lying there and... oh, hank.

04:41.814 --> 04:42.765
[Sniffing]

04:43.266 --> 04:44.600
Honey, you reek.

04:44.600 --> 04:49.105
Oh, uh, yeah. Too much time
near the, uh, the propane tanks today.

04:49.105 --> 04:52.108
Mr. Hill, i'm lester payton
with the texas rangers.

04:52.108 --> 04:53.109
Ah.

04:53.109 --> 04:54.110
Nice to meet you.

04:54.110 --> 04:55.611
[Clearing throat]

04:55.611 --> 04:57.113
Mind if i cut in, payton?

04:57.613 --> 04:59.115
This is my dance.

04:59.115 --> 05:01.751
Now, mr. Hill,
i have some questions.

05:01.751 --> 05:07.256
Uh, i--i--i'm sorry. I lost a close friend
and a valued tank-wipe today.

05:07.256 --> 05:08.758
I gotta go home right now.

05:09.258 --> 05:10.760
Peggy, you'll need to drive.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.345
I--i'm in mourning.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.683
That coroner in heimlich county

05:16.683 --> 05:18.434
will get to the bottom of this.

05:18.434 --> 05:20.937
He's a good man.
He did the autopsies

05:20.937 --> 05:23.690
on 2 of my gun-club
buddies last year.

05:23.690 --> 05:27.694
You, uh, you don't think
the police will want to run a drug test

05:27.694 --> 05:29.862
on debbie's coworkers,
do you?

05:29.862 --> 05:32.865
Now that you mention it,
i am positive they will.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.868
They'll drug-test
everyone in arlen.

05:35.868 --> 05:38.955
The price for a bag
of clean urine will double.

05:38.955 --> 05:41.457
W-what do you think'll happen
to the price of poo-poo?

05:41.958 --> 05:43.459
Unchanged.

05:47.964 --> 05:49.415
[Hank sighs]

05:49.415 --> 05:51.751
Debbie bought those flowers
just before she died.

05:52.168 --> 05:53.419
Attention, everybody.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.923
Now that there's no one left at work
for my husband to diddle,

05:56.923 --> 05:58.925
i've allowed him
to return.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.927
Buck strickland.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.428
[Clapping]

06:02.428 --> 06:03.679
Ah. Thank you.

06:03.679 --> 06:06.682
Now, i ain't a stupid man.
I heard the rumors.

06:06.682 --> 06:09.685
I know that i got some fingers
a-pointin' at me.

06:09.685 --> 06:12.188
But i'm givin' y'all
the buck strickland guarantee

06:12.188 --> 06:14.190
that i didn't kill
that pretty girl.

06:14.190 --> 06:16.609
I wanna catch the murderer
more than anything.

06:16.609 --> 06:19.912
So, if any of you have information
for the police,

06:20.196 --> 06:21.697
why don't you just
come see me first?

06:22.198 --> 06:24.250
We can discuss the bes
t way of handlin' that.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.869
Back to work, old top.

06:35.795 --> 06:36.796
[Sighs]

06:37.296 --> 06:38.798
All right, ladybird.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.800
I washed this shirt
a dozen times.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.301
[Sniffing]

06:42.301 --> 06:43.519
What do you think, girl?

06:43.519 --> 06:45.605
Can you still
smell the mary jane?

06:46.105 --> 06:46.606
[Sniffing]

06:47.023 --> 06:48.107
Oh, no.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.526
[Birds chirping]

07:00.369 --> 07:04.123
Uncle hank,
sheriff mumford is here.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.042
Afternoon, hank.
What are you cookin'?

07:06.042 --> 07:07.910
Uh, n-nothing.

07:07.910 --> 07:09.745
Well, my eyesight
ain't what it used to be,

07:09.745 --> 07:13.249
but ain't that some kind of smoke
comin' out of there?

07:13.249 --> 07:14.550
Um, that's the burgers.

07:14.550 --> 07:17.086
Strange-smellin' burgers.

07:17.086 --> 07:18.838
What kind of herbs
you puttin' in there?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.673
Herbs? Oh, god!

07:20.673 --> 07:22.475
That's street talk
for marijuana.

07:22.842 --> 07:23.843
You know, hank,

07:23.843 --> 07:25.344
i spent the day
gathering evidence

07:25.344 --> 07:28.648
over at the casa linda
singles apartments.

07:29.148 --> 07:32.852
And, well, i just thought
you might want to know you are now a suspect...

07:32.852 --> 07:34.320
oh, no!

07:34.320 --> 07:36.823
...in the murder
of debbie grund.
Oh.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.324
[Tittering]
Oh, that.

07:38.691 --> 07:39.992
Oh, god!

07:42.912 --> 07:45.715
Now, this goes
without saying, peggy,

07:46.215 --> 07:47.717
but you know
i'm not guilty.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.719
Of course i know
you didn't kill anyone

07:50.219 --> 07:52.138
but you know what
i do not understand?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.006
The sheriff said
that you had a motive

07:54.006 --> 07:56.976
and it concerns your relationship
with miz liz.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.395
He kept using
that phrase.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.731
"Relationship
with miz liz."

08:01.731 --> 08:04.567
"Relationship
with miz liz."

08:04.567 --> 08:07.069
Uh, well, he may
be referring

08:07.069 --> 08:09.572
to this time
i, uh, went out

08:09.572 --> 08:12.575
to a fraudulent propane emergency
at mrs. Strickland's,

08:12.575 --> 08:16.579
and, uh, well,
she was in a kimono,

08:16.579 --> 08:20.583
and, uh, she wanted me
to, uh, service her

08:20.583 --> 08:21.584
[clears throat]

08:22.084 --> 08:25.254
A-accessories,
uh, not the propane.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.756
.
Oh, okey-dokey

08:26.756 --> 08:28.341
well, now,
that makes some sense.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.843
Mrs. Strickland
was coming on to you,

08:30.843 --> 08:32.345
so you kill debbie

08:32.845 --> 08:34.347
buck goes back
to miz liz,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.265
and miz liz
stops bothering you.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.268
Have you been reading
those rabbi mysteries again?

08:39.268 --> 08:40.770
They do hold up.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.023
Now, if i may be
an advocate of the devil here,

08:44.023 --> 08:45.525
let's combine your motive

08:45.525 --> 08:48.528
with the fact that you hav
e no alibi for 6:45 p.m.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.563
Oh, and the sheriff
called earlier.

08:50.563 --> 08:53.065
He said that they found
your strickland name patch

08:53.065 --> 08:55.651
in the bushes behind
peggy's sugarfoot's.

08:55.651 --> 08:58.154
What? I don't remember
losing my "hank" patch.

08:58.154 --> 08:59.655
Well, you didn't lose it.

08:59.655 --> 09:02.658
He said it had been torn off
as if in a struggle.

09:06.412 --> 09:07.413
[Hank exclaims]

09:07.914 --> 09:11.000
So, hank,
my question to you is:

09:11.334 --> 09:14.470
Why did you not tell me
that miz liz made a pass at you?

09:18.507 --> 09:21.510
So, i was wondering if kid
s who are hopped up on drugs

09:21.510 --> 09:24.013
could do things
they wouldn't remember

09:24.013 --> 09:26.349
when they, you know,
hopped back down.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.184
Absolutely, mr. Jones.

09:28.184 --> 09:29.685
So my son,

09:29.685 --> 09:32.188
who'll be attending arlen high
in a couple of years,

09:32.188 --> 09:33.689
god willing,

09:33.689 --> 09:36.192
and he could get, uh, bake

09:36.192 --> 09:38.694
and leave his nametag
in some bushes somewhere

09:38.694 --> 09:40.029
and then not remember?

09:40.029 --> 09:42.031
Y-yeah. We call that
blacking out.

09:42.031 --> 09:45.034
Heck, i was in prison with a guy who was doing
life for a murder

09:45.034 --> 09:47.286
he didn't even remember
committing. Ok?

09:47.286 --> 09:51.290
So someone could take dope
, black out in a field,

09:51.791 --> 09:52.541
and kill a coworker?

09:52.541 --> 09:55.011
Coworker,
cab driver, prostitute

09:55.511 --> 09:56.462
it doesn't matter who.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.307
[Grunts]

10:08.307 --> 10:11.811
All right. This is about
what debbie weighed.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.230
Does this seem familiar?

10:14.230 --> 10:15.231
Maybe.

10:15.231 --> 10:16.482
[Car approaching]

10:20.369 --> 10:21.737
(mr. Strickland)
Evening, hank.

10:21.737 --> 10:23.956
What are you busying
yourself with there?

10:23.956 --> 10:27.960
Uh, just throwin' out
some expired sand.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.245
Garbage cans
at home are full.

10:29.245 --> 10:30.746
Whatever.
We need to talk.

10:30.746 --> 10:33.165
Let's take a ride.
Your truck.

10:35.885 --> 10:36.886
Uh, where to, sir?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.387
The quarry.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.889
It's deserted
this time of night.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.557
Nobody'll bother us.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.072
Mr. Strickland,
sir, i want you to know

10:56.072 --> 10:57.907
that i don't think
i killed debbie.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.326
I cared for that gal, hank

11:00.326 --> 11:03.329
so, if you've taken me
out here to kill me in retribution,

11:03.329 --> 11:06.449
I believe that
would be premature

11:06.449 --> 11:08.451
i know you fooled around
with debbie, old top.

11:08.451 --> 11:10.453
No, not true.
I rebuffed.

11:10.453 --> 11:12.455
But you were angry at her.

11:12.955 --> 11:13.956
Y-yes.
Louder.

11:13.956 --> 11:15.458
Yes, i was angry.

11:15.458 --> 11:16.959
Debbie threatened
to tell my wife

11:16.959 --> 11:18.961
that we had
sexual relations.

11:18.961 --> 11:20.963
Ok, hank.
I--i got all i need.

11:37.697 --> 11:42.451
A 12-gauge shell.
Oh, my god!

11:42.451 --> 11:46.072
I want you to promise me
you won't ever do drugs, bobby.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.573
I promise.

11:48.074 --> 11:51.077
A promise means nothing
when a junkie tricks you
into smoking a joint

11:51.077 --> 11:52.411
when you think
it's a cigarette,

11:52.411 --> 11:53.913
which you shouldn't smoke,
either.

11:54.413 --> 11:55.915
Now, promise me,
promise me, bobby.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.717
Ok, ok, i promise.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.501
[Sighs]

11:59.001 --> 12:00.386
Promises mean nothing.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.838
Look, dad,

12:02.838 --> 12:06.842
i'm not gonna use drugs
because drugs are for losers.

12:06.842 --> 12:08.844
And i'd never wann
a disappoint you.

12:08.844 --> 12:10.346
[Sighing]
Oh.

12:10.346 --> 12:14.350
Plus, i wanna be the first chubby comic
to live past 35.

12:20.689 --> 12:22.191
Afternoon, hank.

12:22.191 --> 12:23.692
Oh. Hi, sheriff.

12:23.692 --> 12:26.195
Uh, any leads
on the, uh, murderer

12:26.195 --> 12:27.696
that don't point
in my direction?

12:27.696 --> 12:29.665
Ms. Hill, could you
excuse us a moment?

12:29.665 --> 12:31.667
I'd like to tell your husband
a dirty joke.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.669
Sheriff, if this is
about the investigation,

12:34.170 --> 12:35.955
i assure you,
you can speak freely.

12:35.955 --> 12:39.291
My husband and i
have no secrets between us.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.426
Cigarette?

12:41.377 --> 12:43.212
No, we do not smoke.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.464
That's smart. Filthy habit.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.933
Say, could i trouble you
for a light?

12:48.434 --> 12:49.718
Uh, i could look
in the house.

12:49.718 --> 12:52.438
Oh, n-never mind. I got
this here silver lighter.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.806
Found it
in debbie's apartment.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.609
Got the initials
"h.r.h." on it.

12:57.893 --> 13:00.112
Say, now,
what's your middle name?

13:00.112 --> 13:01.781
Rutherford.
Right.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.783
H.r.h.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.286
So, unless his royal highness
the prince of wales

13:07.286 --> 13:08.788
stopped by sunday
night for a smoke--

13:09.288 --> 13:10.790
o-ok. The lighter's mine.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.793
It was a gift from
mrs. Elizabeth strickland.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.795
I--i know all about miz liz.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.497
As i said,
i know everything...

13:18.998 --> 13:20.466
about my husband.

13:20.749 --> 13:23.169
So you know about your husband's
relationship with debbie?

13:23.169 --> 13:24.670
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.671
What relationship?

13:26.172 --> 13:28.174
I had no relationship
with debbie.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.091
Sheriff?

13:29.091 --> 13:30.593
Uh-huh.

13:31.093 --> 13:33.729
If i may.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.731
(hank) Debbie threatened
to tell my wife

13:35.731 --> 13:37.733
that we had sexual relations.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.101
[Tape recorder clicks]

13:39.568 --> 13:42.571
Well, i'm sure you folks
have plenty to talk about.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.573
Y'all have a nice day.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.695
I didn't sleep with debbie

13:49.695 --> 13:52.615
i don't know how my lighter
got into her apartment.

13:52.615 --> 13:57.620
And i already told you about bein' in the bathtub
with a naked miz liz.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.421
Did you see her breasts?

13:59.421 --> 14:01.540
Hey, charlie manson.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.541
Can i get your autograph

14:02.541 --> 14:04.877
on this sugarfoot napkin
i pull out of dumpster?

14:04.877 --> 14:09.215
If you murder her, i auction it on ebay
for big bucks.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.550
Ebay? Wait a minute.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.054
Damn. The ebay auction closed.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.522
I lost my weevil.

14:18.974 --> 14:19.975
[Inhaling]

14:21.694 --> 14:23.312
[Moaning]

14:25.614 --> 14:26.866
[Gagging]

14:30.486 --> 14:33.989
Kahn, you may have just made
my autograph worthless.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.713
The auction for that purple weevil wobbler,
what time did it close?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.214
6:58 p.m.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.217
Oh, you wanna go in a chat room
with gene roddenberry's wife?

14:45.217 --> 14:48.754
Listen to me.
Debbie was killed at 6:45.

14:48.754 --> 14:51.757
I didn't inhale until 7:00
at the earliest.

14:51.757 --> 14:54.927
I couldn't have blacked out and killed her.
She was already dead.

14:54.927 --> 14:55.928
Yeah, dude.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.930
You were here
smokin' pot with me.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.683
[Holding breath]
You can tell that to the cops.
I'll back you up.

15:05.821 --> 15:06.855
[Car engine starting]

15:10.192 --> 15:11.577
[Door closes]

15:11.577 --> 15:13.579
Leaving the get in, get out
so soon, payton?

15:14.029 --> 15:16.532
I'm sure there's some candy bars
you haven't questioned.

15:16.532 --> 15:19.034
You had better take them 3 musketeers
into separate rooms.

15:19.535 --> 15:20.703
Maybe one of 'em will crack.

15:20.703 --> 15:22.204
That's a good one, sheriff

15:22.204 --> 15:24.006
how'd hee hawever
let you get away?

15:29.845 --> 15:31.297
Mmm-mmm.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.383
Do i smell peggy hill's old-fashioned buttermilk
griddlecakes?

15:34.383 --> 15:36.885
Sheriff, now, i'm sure
you did not come all this way

15:36.885 --> 15:40.306
just to smell peggy hill's
old-fashioned buttermilk griddlecakes.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.307
Guilty.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.309
Speaking of which, mr. Hill,

15:43.309 --> 15:45.811
debbie's roommate gale's
got an interesting alibi

15:46.312 --> 15:47.313
for the night
of the murder.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.315
Says he was with you,
sparking up a j.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.450
In english, please?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.202
Lighting up a j.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.871
[Gasping]
Getting high? He said that

15:55.871 --> 15:59.792
well,now you have a second crime
to investigate, sheriff.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.795
The attempted assassination
of my husband's character.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.830
How dare you!

16:04.830 --> 16:07.333
My dad would never use drugs.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.335
I say good day, sheriff.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.170
Mr. Hill?

16:15.507 --> 16:18.510
Uh, the boy's right.
I would never smoke pot.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.513
Yeah, yeah, you're as square
as a block of wood.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.516
But this gale feller,
he's from up north.

16:24.516 --> 16:26.018
Hair down to his butt crack

16:26.018 --> 16:28.020
and a layer of filth
that just don't wash off.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.241
Now that i've talked to you,
i know he's just a liar who's got no alibi.

16:37.446 --> 16:39.748
They're arresting
the murderer on t.v.!

16:39.748 --> 16:41.367
It's a woman!

16:41.367 --> 16:42.368
Who is it?

16:42.368 --> 16:43.369
(peggy)
A woman?

16:43.369 --> 16:45.371
(woman on t.v.)
Another arrest at the--

16:45.371 --> 16:47.289
that's not a woman,
that's debbie's roommate.

16:47.289 --> 16:49.124
Uh-uh, her name is gale.

16:49.124 --> 16:52.127
I've never had a homicide go
unsolved in heimlich county,

16:52.127 --> 16:55.381
and my record stands intact.
2 for 2.

16:55.381 --> 16:58.884
But gale couldn't have
done it. He--he was...

16:58.884 --> 17:00.886
he was what, dad?

17:00.886 --> 17:02.888
Uh, n-nothing.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.391
Come on, show peggy's sugarfoot's
in the background.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.394
Show peggy's sugarfoot's
in the background. Show peggy's sugarfoot's..

17:08.394 --> 17:09.395
Yes!

17:12.513 --> 17:16.268
You know, uh, i'm not
so sure this, uh, gale, is it?

17:16.769 --> 17:20.772
I'm just not so sure
he's the right guy who did the murder.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.608
Well, now you're just
talking crazy, hank.

17:23.025 --> 17:24.026
The sheriff
arrested him.

17:24.026 --> 17:25.327
That means
he's guilty.

17:25.327 --> 17:26.694
Bill's right.

17:26.694 --> 17:27.695
I should know.

17:28.196 --> 17:30.699
I've served on 4 jurie
s and we did our job.

17:30.699 --> 17:32.201
4 convictions.

17:32.201 --> 17:35.204
It is not your job as a juror
to just convict.

17:35.204 --> 17:36.205
Is too

17:38.540 --> 17:40.008
[all chattering]

17:40.008 --> 17:42.010
I just wanna say thanks
to buck strickland

17:42.010 --> 17:44.046
for throwin' this
case-closed dinner.

17:44.046 --> 17:45.347
(man #1)
Hear, hear.

17:45.347 --> 17:47.099
The party's also
a sendoff to our good friend,

17:47.433 --> 17:48.434
texas ranger payton,

17:48.434 --> 17:50.936
Who was unable
to solve the crime

17:50.936 --> 17:53.355
[people murmuring]

17:53.806 --> 17:57.309
I hope gale doesn't get off
on some pothead technicality,

17:57.810 --> 17:58.811
right, dad?

17:58.811 --> 18:01.814
Well, those technicalities
have a name, bobby.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.899
They're called
the bill of rights

18:03.899 --> 18:05.901
oh, he's got a right,
he's got a right arm

18:05.901 --> 18:07.402
for them to stick
the needle in.

18:07.402 --> 18:09.238
(man #2)
That'd be good.

18:09.238 --> 18:11.573
All right. All right.
That's enough.

18:11.573 --> 18:14.076
Gale did not kill debbie.

18:14.076 --> 18:16.462
That's right.
He's innocent.

18:16.462 --> 18:19.381
And i know that because
at the time of the murder,

18:19.381 --> 18:21.383
gale was with me.

18:21.383 --> 18:23.385
We were in debbie's apartment,

18:25.337 --> 18:29.842
and, like he said,
we were smoking pot.

18:29.842 --> 18:30.843
[All exclaiming]

18:30.843 --> 18:32.978
?
Who are you, hank hill

18:32.978 --> 18:34.980
now--now,
it was an accident.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.482
I didn't know it was pot,

18:36.482 --> 18:38.984
and god knows
i didn't enjoy it.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.486
But the fact remains,
sheriff,

18:40.486 --> 18:42.488
you have the wrong man
in your jail.

18:43.989 --> 18:45.491
Then it was buck.

18:45.491 --> 18:46.992
Uh-uh, it wasn't me.
I-it was hank.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.494
D-d-didn't you get the tape?

18:48.494 --> 18:51.246
What about that, uh,"hank" nametag
i put in the bushes?

18:51.246 --> 18:52.998
It wasn't hank, it was you.
No, it wasn't.

18:53.282 --> 18:56.118
Then it was miz liz.
No, it wasn't.

18:56.118 --> 18:57.336
All right, fine.
It was me.

18:57.836 --> 18:58.837
I'm your man, sheriff.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.339
You got the right
to remain silent--

19:00.339 --> 19:03.008
if you people are
just about finished,

19:03.342 --> 19:06.345
i'll tell you
who killed debbie.

19:06.345 --> 19:09.348
Debbie's phone record showed
she called mr. Hank hill

19:09.348 --> 19:10.849
a short while
before her death.

19:10.849 --> 19:13.352
Which means
she was home at 6:00 p.m.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.853
Now, what would she have seen

19:14.853 --> 19:17.773
if she looked out her window
at 6:00 p.m., hmm?

19:18.140 --> 19:20.142
Normally, she'd see
sheriff mumford

19:20.142 --> 19:22.611
stuffing some sugarfoot's ribs
into his face.

19:23.111 --> 19:25.197
But on this night,
she saw mr. Buck

19:25.197 --> 19:28.483
and miz liz strickland
entering the restaurant.

19:28.483 --> 19:30.702
Which, according to the sugarfoot's
reservations book,

19:31.203 --> 19:31.954
occurred at...

19:31.954 --> 19:36.208
6:03, mister,
and 6:04, missus.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.043
Seeing buck and miz liz
back together

19:38.544 --> 19:41.547
must have thrown that pretty little tank-wipe
into a jealous rage.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.549
So when she went down
to sugarfoot's--

19:43.549 --> 19:45.551
ah! Peggy's sugarfoot's.

19:45.551 --> 19:46.718
At the time it was

19:46.718 --> 19:48.220
yeah.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.056
The point is, she went there
to kill buck strickland

19:51.056 --> 19:54.593
with the 12-gauge shotgun
he had stashed in her apartment.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.511
So she climbed into the dumpster
next to his cadillac

19:56.511 --> 19:58.564
to lie in wait.

19:58.564 --> 20:02.568
Now, sitting in a dumpster full of half-eaten barbecue
can make you hungry.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.320
And sure enough,
debbie went across the street

20:05.737 --> 20:07.322
To the get in, get out

20:07.823 --> 20:09.658
according to the store
security videotape

20:09.658 --> 20:12.160
and a written deposition
from a mr. Freddie hakimi,

20:12.661 --> 20:13.662
she purchased a big gulp

20:14.162 --> 20:16.665
and a 99-cent nacho plate.

20:16.665 --> 20:20.035
By buying them together,
she saved 23 cents.

20:20.035 --> 20:23.288
My god!
That is one heck of a deal

20:23.622 --> 20:24.957
when debbie returned
to the dumpster,

20:25.374 --> 20:26.875
she saw mr. Strickland's car

20:26.875 --> 20:28.543
and assumed
he was still there.

20:28.543 --> 20:32.047
What she didn't know was that the stricklands
had already left together

20:32.047 --> 20:36.051
in mrs. Strickland's car,
having reconciled physically in a storeroom,

20:36.051 --> 20:37.936
and again
in the meat locker

20:37.936 --> 20:41.139
and once more
in the slop sink.

20:41.139 --> 20:42.975
She had difficulty
juggling the 3 items

20:43.475 --> 20:45.477
as she attempted
to negotiate her way

20:45.477 --> 20:46.979
back into the dumpster.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.981
She put the gun in first.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.867
She wouldn't let go
of that junk food.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.369
And that was the source
of her demise.

20:54.369 --> 20:56.872
For as debbie climbed
into that dumpster,

20:56.872 --> 20:59.708
her foot accidentally tripped
the hammer on the gun.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.209
[Grunting]

21:01.209 --> 21:02.210
[Gunshot]

21:03.629 --> 21:07.132
So, debbie grund's killer
was debbie grund.

21:07.633 --> 21:11.136
Oh, buck,
i am so relieved.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.638
Well, i thought it was you

21:12.638 --> 21:14.640

, too, miz liz.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.475
Yeah, i'd have done it
for you.

21:16.475 --> 21:17.976
Course, i thought you did it.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.979
That's why i planted
the shotgun shell in hank's truck,

21:20.979 --> 21:22.564
to protect you.

21:22.564 --> 21:25.233
You planted evidence for me?

21:25.734 --> 21:26.735
Yeah.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.820
Oh, sugarfoot.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.322

21:32.024 --> 21:34.026
Sorry about that whole
frame-up there, tonto.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.827
I was under a lot of stress.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.829
Uh, yeah.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.331
Yeah, ok.

21:39.831 --> 21:42.334
I guess if my mistress
had been murdered

21:42.834 --> 21:44.836
and my wife were a suspect, uh...

21:44.836 --> 21:46.838

21:46.838 --> 21:49.341
Well, i guess i let you down, son.

21:49.341 --> 21:52.294
Doin' drugs like that
when i've always told you not to.

21:52.511 --> 21:55.514
You know, if i did something like this,
you'd punish me.

21:55.514 --> 21:59.017
Maybe i should be
able to punish you.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.937
Well, ok, son.
What's my punishment?

22:01.937 --> 22:03.271
Am i grounded?

22:03.772 --> 22:05.273
That's too easy.

22:05.273 --> 22:09.227
You cannot mow the lawn
for one week.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.229
