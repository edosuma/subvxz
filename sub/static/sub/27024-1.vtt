- Sorry.
- Go.

00:55.720 --> 00:56.688
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

00:59.191 --> 01:00.524
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>

01:00.526 --> 01:01.491
Yeah.

01:04.396 --> 01:05.063
Yeah.

01:07.165 --> 01:07.834
Yeah.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.469
Lift up your feet.
All right, now.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.835
Let's sound like one family.

01:12.837 --> 01:13.836
Somebody's off.

01:37.763 --> 01:40.764
You know what I want
you to say. Tell me a story.

01:40.766 --> 01:42.701
Buy a DVD?
Real good one, you sure?

01:44.335 --> 01:47.204
Guys, DVDs. It's real cheap.
Two, three bucks.

01:47.206 --> 01:48.871
Hey. Come on.

01:48.873 --> 01:50.242
I want your soul in there.
Let me hear it.

01:50.876 --> 01:51.844
There you go.

02:17.937 --> 02:18.771
<i>Dance it
like you feel it.</i>

02:23.542 --> 02:24.610
<i>Stay together.</i>

02:30.449 --> 02:31.184
There you go.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.823
Don't think about the next step,
just take it.

02:38.524 --> 02:39.592
Uh-huh!

02:43.429 --> 02:45.629
Good. There, there,
there, there.

02:45.631 --> 02:49.902
Some acids and metals react to
each other to produce hydrogen.

02:52.471 --> 02:53.706
Yeah, have a seat, Mr. Davis.

03:02.914 --> 03:04.250
You gonna say hi, or what?

03:12.657 --> 03:13.525
Here!

03:19.298 --> 03:19.799
Hey, guys.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.868
Ugh! You stink.

03:24.469 --> 03:24.971
Partner up.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.276
Uh... No.

03:31.576 --> 03:32.412
I work with Gina.

03:35.046 --> 03:36.848
Well, it'll be nice
to mix it up, right?

03:41.687 --> 03:44.856
Now, that's not much of a lunch.

03:47.659 --> 03:48.561
Take mine.

03:49.395 --> 03:49.963
I haven't touched it.

03:50.862 --> 03:51.997
No, thanks. I'm good.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.935
You have a name, son?

03:57.536 --> 03:59.068
Why?

03:59.070 --> 04:01.674
I just wanted to know if you
wanted to take my class next year.

04:05.343 --> 04:06.645
If you can't dance, it's fine.

04:07.812 --> 04:08.747
We'll start you slow.

04:09.581 --> 04:11.918
It's hard to explain,
but I can't.

04:12.651 --> 04:13.586
Thanks, though.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.399
Yo.

04:26.932 --> 04:27.934
Check out the new merch.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.535
Right?

04:30.069 --> 04:31.737
<i>Zombie Santa 3.</i>

04:32.904 --> 04:34.437
- Good movie.
- Dope.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.442
- No.
- So, what... Wait, hold on. Hey.

04:36.942 --> 04:38.444
You know
you want it, <i>papi,</i> come on.

04:39.377 --> 04:41.010
You sold me some garbage
the last time.

04:41.012 --> 04:42.945
What you talking about? All
right, I'll make it up to you.

04:42.947 --> 04:44.748
Buy <i>Zombie Santa 3,</i> I'll give
you 1 and 2 on the house.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.615
- It's the perfect trilogy, man.
- Don't want anything from you.

04:46.617 --> 04:48.620
- Leave me alone.
- Hey, God bless.

04:49.788 --> 04:52.889
- You got your tail between your legs.
- Man, shut up, man.

04:52.891 --> 04:53.559
Can't win 'em all.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.793
Hey, what's poppin', Aaron?

04:56.795 --> 04:57.963
Hey, you hungry?

04:59.098 --> 05:00.031
I guess.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.934
Really? Don't give me that.
I'm being nice.

05:03.134 --> 05:04.168
Whatever.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.135
Hey, you know what?
I was gonna buy you a burger,

05:06.137 --> 05:08.572
but not if you're gonna mope
around like a little bitch, huh?

05:08.574 --> 05:10.373
- I'm not moping.
- Hey, take a sip, little man.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.608
- Are you serious, ma... Hey!
- Yeah.

05:11.610 --> 05:12.642
Come on, what are you doing?

05:12.644 --> 05:14.644
- Don't be a dumbass, man.
- Come on, man.

05:14.646 --> 05:15.678
Later, guys.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.147
Later.

05:17.149 --> 05:18.685
- Hey, Aaron. I got you.
- Come on.

05:19.517 --> 05:20.719
Aaron, don't let
him get to you.

05:26.425 --> 05:27.492
Mmm!

05:30.161 --> 05:32.031
- I wish Dad still worked here.
- Mm.

05:33.432 --> 05:34.901
Should we go back
and get one for him?

05:35.767 --> 05:37.069
Why? He doesn't get us jack.

05:37.702 --> 05:38.470
He tries.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.576
I'd rather spend my cash
on a lady friend instead.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.009
But you don't know any ladies.

05:46.011 --> 05:47.978
Bullshit, man. Ladies love me.

05:47.980 --> 05:48.915
- Yeah, right.
- Hmm.

05:50.149 --> 05:50.983
Oh, great.

05:56.487 --> 05:57.990
Hey, I got enough
for the Ritz tonight.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.726
You ever gonna fix
this thing, huh?

06:03.728 --> 06:05.865
What are you, my mother?
Jump in. Come on.

06:15.173 --> 06:16.675
- It's not funny.
- Kinda.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.011
Oh, crap.

06:19.644 --> 06:21.178
Hey,
it's a no-standing zone, pal.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.046
Yeah, I know that. Sorry, sir.

06:24.048 --> 06:26.017
I've been meaning to take her
in and get her tuned up.

06:35.093 --> 06:37.597
Um...
We're in the middle of a move.

06:40.699 --> 06:41.734
All right, keep it movin'.

06:42.166 --> 06:43.034
Yes, sir.

06:45.137 --> 06:46.139
That was close.

06:46.637 --> 06:47.570
Dad, if he ran your plate...

06:47.572 --> 06:50.039
I know, I know, I know.
I'll figure it out.

06:52.577 --> 06:54.176
What? No burger
for your old man?

06:54.178 --> 06:56.149
I can smell the onions
on your breath.

06:56.814 --> 06:58.016
And something else.

07:08.726 --> 07:10.125
<i>And with a lead of 32-17...</i>

07:10.127 --> 07:11.197
Have you seen my screwdriver?

07:11.829 --> 07:12.764
Nope.

07:14.266 --> 07:15.535
Did Dad take it again?

07:20.672 --> 07:21.774
Nothing on.

07:22.774 --> 07:24.843
- Wait, go back.
- Knock yourself out.

07:26.577 --> 07:27.947
- Nice throw.
- Nice catch.

07:30.882 --> 07:32.217
- Who's next?
- Me.

07:34.653 --> 07:37.456
Not this musical shit
again. You and your moms.

07:38.589 --> 07:40.589
Did you take
Aaron's screwdriver, Dad?

07:40.591 --> 07:42.127
No, I didn't touch it.

07:45.297 --> 07:46.766
Well, at least
there's some eye candy.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.870
You know, the first date I took
your moms to was to see <i>Cats.</i>

07:52.237 --> 07:54.040
She loved that stupid show.

07:55.673 --> 07:58.243
I stood in line for two hours
to get those tickets...

07:59.043 --> 08:01.613
just to watch a bunch
of grown-ass men...

08:02.014 --> 08:04.281
prance and sing around
in cat costumes.

08:06.851 --> 08:08.086
Shoulda seen her smile.

08:09.954 --> 08:10.956
She was so beautiful.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.562
I'm glad you guys look like her.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.067
Enough of that.

08:30.942 --> 08:32.544
Aaron... here.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.179
Don't hurt yourself.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.288
Do you think
I can take dance next year?

08:58.269 --> 08:59.204
There you go.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.618
- Hey, Gramps.
- Hey, baby girl.

09:14.653 --> 09:16.286
- How was your day, huh?
- Pretty good.

09:16.288 --> 09:17.320
- Yeah?
- Not as good as yours.

09:17.322 --> 09:20.592
Oh, boy. I'm havin' the time
of my life here. Whoa!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.260
- Playing your song.
- What?

09:24.962 --> 09:26.197
Oh, wow.

09:27.732 --> 09:30.733
I've gotta get another album,
mine is scratched.

09:30.735 --> 09:34.240
That's... That's
Lincoln Center, '76, '77.

09:36.942 --> 09:39.912
Hey, we were good,
you know that? Yeah, Greg...

09:40.177 --> 09:42.746
I had this, this... Afro,

09:42.748 --> 09:44.079
and Greg had this Jheri curl,
you know?

09:44.081 --> 09:45.714
Every time he danced,

09:45.716 --> 09:47.249
Jheri-curl juice would spill
all down the front of him.

09:49.221 --> 09:50.087
- It's true.
- For real?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.921
Yeah. Oh, here, wait.

09:51.923 --> 09:54.360
This is the encore. Now,
when he danced this, you know...

09:55.360 --> 09:58.795
those women out there, they'd
throw their bra, their panties,

09:58.797 --> 09:59.996
and these groupies would come
in and grope him...

09:59.998 --> 10:01.698
I'm gonna st...

10:01.700 --> 10:03.336
No, I just threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

10:04.235 --> 10:05.203
All right, all right.

10:09.441 --> 10:12.011
I wish you wouldn't baby
that man.

10:13.144 --> 10:14.079
I baby you too.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.022
Ouch!

10:27.024 --> 10:29.361
<i>♪ Oh, happy day, oh, happy day ♪</i>

10:31.096 --> 10:32.862
Let's go, let's go!

10:32.864 --> 10:36.168
Praise to the Lord. Hallelujah.

10:38.235 --> 10:40.136
Take care of yourself.
Hallelujah.

10:40.138 --> 10:41.470
Well, you know the drill,

10:41.472 --> 10:44.009
so take your thumb
outta your ass and pitch in.

10:44.308 --> 10:46.008
I'm gonna close out
some deals today

10:46.010 --> 10:47.646
and then we'll go out
for some fine dining.

10:49.715 --> 10:51.948
Applebee's is not
fine dining, Dad.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.249
Well, aren't you
freakin' fancy, huh?

10:54.251 --> 10:56.486
And what if you don't close
any deals, huh?

10:56.488 --> 10:58.220
Then I'll go to the blood bank.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.958
All right? I don't know.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.361
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

11:04.428 --> 11:05.795
I'll be back.

11:05.797 --> 11:07.700
- Time is money.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:07.999 --> 11:08.968
Enjoy yourselves.

11:10.134 --> 11:11.302
All right. Come on.

11:17.308 --> 11:20.209
Hey. Hey, hey, come on.

11:20.211 --> 11:21.312
I've got a better idea.

11:22.114 --> 11:23.115
What?

11:23.981 --> 11:24.416
Come on.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.959
Anybody wanna buy a MetroCard?
There's $50 on this thing.

11:36.961 --> 11:38.898
Buy a MetroCard here.
Anyone wanna buy a MetroCard?

11:55.514 --> 11:56.478
Hi, little dude.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.484
- Hey.
- Yeah. Cool.

12:00.519 --> 12:01.653
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

12:03.288 --> 12:05.457
My little brother and I,
we're out on the streets, so...

12:06.191 --> 12:08.793
any little bit helps, so please,
give what you can, thank you.

12:09.794 --> 12:10.761
- Thanks, God bless.
- What you doin'?

12:10.763 --> 12:12.896
We really appreciate it,
thank you. Sorry, man.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.229
- Yo!
- Thanks, guys.

12:14.231 --> 12:15.867
All right, thank you.

12:16.067 --> 12:18.868
Hey, thanks very much,
very kind. Thank you.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.570
Yo, what are you doing?
This is my crowd!

12:20.572 --> 12:21.537
- I was here first!
- I'll cut you in, all right?

12:21.539 --> 12:22.872
- How about I cut you up?
- What?

12:22.874 --> 12:24.507
Back off!
Back off, he's just a kid.

12:24.509 --> 12:26.242
No, you back off! You back off!

12:26.244 --> 12:27.379
Let go of him!

12:29.147 --> 12:30.345
- Get off of me!
- Back off.

12:30.347 --> 12:31.480
- It's my spot!
- Come on!

12:31.482 --> 12:32.581
What are you doin'?

12:32.583 --> 12:33.384
- <i>It's my spot!</i>
- <i>He's a kid!</i>

12:34.852 --> 12:36.018
They got me in bracelets

12:36.020 --> 12:37.554
because you had to go
prancing around.

12:37.556 --> 12:38.758
I don't believe this shit.

12:41.826 --> 12:43.193
There you go.
You're good to go.

12:43.195 --> 12:44.227
Thank you.

12:44.229 --> 12:45.230
Hey, wait.

12:46.030 --> 12:47.597
Ain't got a permit, kid. Sorry.

12:47.599 --> 12:48.533
Perfect.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.434
Well, can I at least go now?

12:51.436 --> 12:52.437
Yeah, as soon as you're cleared.

12:53.504 --> 12:54.439
You guys gotta split.

12:55.407 --> 12:56.372
Why?

12:56.374 --> 12:57.408
You know why.

12:59.543 --> 13:00.779
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.782
Yeah, I'll find you
when I get out.

13:03.514 --> 13:05.547
- Go.
- Go!

13:05.549 --> 13:07.285
Hey!

13:07.918 --> 13:08.788
Hey!

13:09.888 --> 13:11.389
Get back here. Stop!

13:12.323 --> 13:13.192
Hey!

13:19.865 --> 13:21.000
The Pacer.

13:21.265 --> 13:22.400
Son of a bitch.

13:23.268 --> 13:24.870
No, no, no.

13:32.344 --> 13:33.445
Come on!

13:56.268 --> 13:57.267
<i>Gramps, watch this.</i>

13:58.669 --> 14:00.072
He's got potential.

14:00.639 --> 14:03.042
But anybody can dance
with sneakers on them.

14:03.341 --> 14:04.610
The kid's dancing on the one...

14:05.476 --> 14:07.009
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute,

14:07.011 --> 14:08.111
I know this kid... I know this...

14:14.952 --> 14:15.855
Miles Bryant.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.321
<i>This is
the Brooklyn Credit Union.</i>

14:18.323 --> 14:22.193
<i>Our records show that the account
of Greg and Miles Bryant is...</i>

14:23.662 --> 14:25.564
- Who was that?
- Nobody important.

14:26.498 --> 14:27.930
Was it one of your groupies?

14:27.932 --> 14:29.431
Yeah, one of my groupies.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.699
You should see this one too.

14:30.701 --> 14:32.468
Boy, she was built
just like that, boy.

14:32.470 --> 14:34.369
- No.
- Yeah.

14:34.371 --> 14:35.640
- No!
- I mean it.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.513
Why don't you do it? Come on.

14:42.679 --> 14:45.583
Because Ms. Loretta would see
me coming from a block away.

14:46.283 --> 14:47.218
Right?

14:48.620 --> 14:50.255
- It's gotta be you.
- Right.

14:51.089 --> 14:52.024
Do you wanna eat?

14:53.024 --> 14:54.025
Do you want to eat?

14:56.061 --> 14:58.030
Don't gimme that.
Get your ass in there. Go.

15:01.499 --> 15:02.965
Hurry up!

15:02.967 --> 15:04.269
- I'll take my time, thanks.
- Jeez.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.543
Hey, man. Watch out.

15:14.044 --> 15:15.213
Hey, whatever, man.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.262
Hello, Ms. Loretta.
How you doing?

15:33.264 --> 15:34.667
Hello, Miles.
I'm doin' great, thank you.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.607
Hey, hey, hey.
This ain't gonna happen.

15:43.274 --> 15:46.041
No, no, you're not gonna be
stealing from my cafeteria.

15:46.043 --> 15:47.278
- Now, no, you in trouble.
- Hey! Stop!

15:48.245 --> 15:48.980
Hey.

15:50.280 --> 15:50.982
That's enough.

15:51.682 --> 15:52.717
Enough. Okay?

15:53.784 --> 15:54.620
You come with me.

15:57.288 --> 15:58.488
This way.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.625
This don't make
no sense.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.961
And I see you, Albee.

16:05.096 --> 16:06.331
Where's that damn janitor at?

16:07.298 --> 16:08.100
Larry!

16:13.071 --> 16:14.505
I did some investigating.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.273
And it looks like their dad is
in county for the next 12 days.

16:18.275 --> 16:18.743
Yup.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.743
I gotta call
Child Protective Services.

16:21.745 --> 16:23.278
Oh, no, no.
Carver, no. Come on, now.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.080
You...

16:25.082 --> 16:27.052
You want those boys to spend
Christmas in the system?

16:28.219 --> 16:29.321
Come on, now.

16:30.754 --> 16:32.624
No, I'll take care of them
myself if it comes down to that.

16:34.658 --> 16:35.624
You don't have
to do that, Miles.

16:35.626 --> 16:37.328
Yeah, I know, I know I don't.

16:38.296 --> 16:40.095
But they seem
like such good boys.

16:40.097 --> 16:41.699
They're in a little bit
of trouble, that's all.

16:45.269 --> 16:46.337
I'm gonna call the station.

16:48.339 --> 16:50.275
- You're a good man.
- Yeah, yeah. I know.

17:00.217 --> 17:01.152
Hey, guys.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.189
We can't let you
leave on your own.

17:04.855 --> 17:05.921
But I spoke to Randy

17:05.923 --> 17:08.626
and he said you can stay
with me until he's released.

17:10.461 --> 17:12.327
So, this afternoon,
after the class,

17:12.329 --> 17:14.198
you will come
to my apartment and...

17:15.232 --> 17:17.467
maybe you can get a home-cooked
meal and a hot shower.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.369
How does that sound?

17:19.471 --> 17:20.635
Kinda creepy.

17:20.637 --> 17:22.505
You just invited two students

17:22.507 --> 17:24.308
over to your house
for a hot shower.

17:26.611 --> 17:27.512
No, seriously, though.

17:28.746 --> 17:31.279
You will be staying
with me for a bit.

17:31.281 --> 17:32.849
We'll be fine.
But thank you for the offer.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.620
No, no. There's no debate.

17:35.686 --> 17:36.354
You're gonna stay with me,

17:37.721 --> 17:39.391
or Carver's gonna call
Social Services.

17:40.625 --> 17:41.492
All right?

17:42.426 --> 17:45.129
So, come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

17:52.737 --> 17:53.672
Hey, Aaron.

17:54.439 --> 17:55.240
Yeah?

17:57.407 --> 17:58.576
How'd you like to take my class?

17:59.676 --> 18:01.112
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.290
Password is ABC123.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.257
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

18:15.259 --> 18:16.424
Look, I'm 70 years old,
what do you expect?

18:16.426 --> 18:17.862
I do the best I can. All right?

18:19.196 --> 18:20.631
All right, everybody, listen up.

18:21.965 --> 18:24.534
Want you to meet Aaron. He's
gonna be joining us. All right?

18:24.536 --> 18:25.901
Circle up, circle up.

18:25.903 --> 18:28.371
And Aaron, you pick up
what you can. Here we go.

18:32.242 --> 18:33.508
Don't forget
that the Best In The Boroughs

18:33.510 --> 18:35.178
is comin' up in two weeks.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.180
And the prize is $40,000.

18:38.182 --> 18:39.151
What's that?

18:39.450 --> 18:41.183
The big dance contest.

18:41.185 --> 18:43.288
Five, six, seven, eight.

18:45.423 --> 18:46.525
Let me see what you got.

18:48.192 --> 18:48.826
All right.

18:50.194 --> 18:52.263
Yeah. Yeah.

18:54.865 --> 18:55.733
Yeah.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.301
Yeah.

18:59.636 --> 19:00.538
You've got it.

19:01.373 --> 19:02.307
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Come on, Aaron.

19:03.273 --> 19:04.742
Bring it on, boy.
Bring the love in the room.

19:06.644 --> 19:07.645
Let's do it.

19:09.513 --> 19:10.348
All right!

19:12.450 --> 19:13.451
Get down, baby.

19:13.984 --> 19:14.852
Yeah.

19:15.752 --> 19:16.654
All right.

19:17.588 --> 19:18.723
All right, there you go.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.859
Yes. Yeah.

19:23.528 --> 19:24.462
Oh, yeah.

19:25.529 --> 19:26.764
Uh-huh!

19:27.798 --> 19:28.764
Yeah.

19:28.766 --> 19:30.766
- Yo!
- Yeah!

19:30.768 --> 19:31.737
Whoa.

19:33.503 --> 19:34.305
All right.

19:37.474 --> 19:38.876
Pow! Yeah.

19:39.576 --> 19:41.544
Whoa!

19:41.546 --> 19:42.780
All right, y'all.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.347
Now, just remember.

19:45.349 --> 19:47.318
You go to bed,
you keep those shoes on.

19:47.951 --> 19:49.654
And don't you eat
too much turkey.

19:49.988 --> 19:50.956
You get the itis.

19:52.323 --> 19:54.356
Happy holidays,
and I love you madly.

20:01.531 --> 20:02.832
- Hey, Gramps?
- Yeah?

20:02.834 --> 20:04.503
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, well, we should talk.

20:05.936 --> 20:07.939
So Mr. B is Faith's gramps.

20:08.873 --> 20:09.740
Nice.

20:11.476 --> 20:12.477
You know her?

20:13.278 --> 20:14.776
She is one
of my lady friends, yes.

20:14.778 --> 20:15.814
We got two more.

20:16.513 --> 20:17.215
Is that...

20:20.917 --> 20:21.886
What is this place?

20:23.020 --> 20:24.722
It's a friggin' karate
dojo, what do you think?

20:25.757 --> 20:26.892
Used to be something special.

20:27.724 --> 20:28.923
What happened?

20:28.925 --> 20:29.824
Time.

20:47.711 --> 20:49.681
This isn't exactly
the penthouse.

20:49.913 --> 20:51.913
We have two bedrooms.

20:51.915 --> 20:56.052
And we have this couch over
here which is a... sofa bed,

20:56.054 --> 20:57.519
it folds out.

20:57.521 --> 20:58.821
If you guys don't mind,
you can crash there.

20:58.823 --> 21:00.025
We won't be staying.

21:01.726 --> 21:02.761
Huh?

21:03.361 --> 21:04.396
Maybe we should.

21:06.096 --> 21:07.331
I can take care of you.

21:07.597 --> 21:09.731
I know,
but just until Dad gets out.

21:09.733 --> 21:13.271
We don't need him.
We can survive on our own.

21:15.472 --> 21:16.474
It's warm here.

21:16.874 --> 21:17.907
- Gramps?
- Yeah?

21:17.909 --> 21:19.411
I borrowed your iPod.

21:19.943 --> 21:20.745
Just as long as you what?

21:21.747 --> 21:23.612
Remember to put it back
where you found it.

21:25.950 --> 21:29.919
Well... you know, I guess if
Aaron wants to, we can stay.

21:29.921 --> 21:32.490
Oh, good, good.

21:32.990 --> 21:33.991
We have two rules.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.062
The theater is off-limits, okay?

21:39.896 --> 21:41.363
And so is my granddaughter.

21:46.436 --> 21:48.873
- So much for your lady friend.
- Shut up.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.961
Hey, Aaron. Do me a favor
and take that garbage out.

22:12.696 --> 22:13.828
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

22:20.671 --> 22:22.941
Albee, it's 10:30.
Get your butt out of bed.

22:47.432 --> 22:48.366
Hey.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.132
Remind Faith
to take you and Albee

22:50.134 --> 22:52.770
down to the thrift store
little later, okay?

22:59.676 --> 23:00.676
What's the matter, son?

23:00.678 --> 23:01.713
What's this?

23:02.980 --> 23:03.981
What's what?

23:11.955 --> 23:12.823
Nothing.

23:13.990 --> 23:16.461
But it says to open now.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.193
I already know what's inside.

23:18.195 --> 23:20.932
It's not the first time
I got one of those.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.732
It's from the bank.

23:24.734 --> 23:26.201
Yes, everything is cool,
got everything under control.

23:26.203 --> 23:27.471
All right?

23:27.771 --> 23:28.740
- Okay.
- Good.

23:32.509 --> 23:33.545
Is he still asleep?

23:35.813 --> 23:37.916
Albee! Wake up!

23:41.152 --> 23:42.586
You keep this TV on all night?

23:43.054 --> 23:44.186
Huh?

23:44.188 --> 23:45.754
Who said that was a good idea?

23:45.756 --> 23:47.756
- Where's the remote?
- What's with all the shouting?

23:47.758 --> 23:49.592
We fell asleep watching a movie.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.927
Our guests are raising the electric
bill is what the shouting is about.

23:51.929 --> 23:54.497
Okay, Gramps, you fall asleep
in front of the TV all the time.

23:54.499 --> 23:56.201
So calm down
before you have a stroke, okay?

23:59.871 --> 24:01.105
What? Did something else happen?

24:05.009 --> 24:09.047
No. Hey, Albee,
I'm sorry I went overboard.

24:10.047 --> 24:11.450
I haven't had much sleep.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.836
What you doin' trespassing
in my theater, white boy?

27:19.936 --> 27:21.105
I'm staying with Mr. B.

27:23.140 --> 27:25.076
- Miles?
- Yeah.

27:27.978 --> 27:29.314
I see you've met
my brother, Greg.

27:34.417 --> 27:36.120
- Wait, you're brothers?
- Mm-hm.

27:37.288 --> 27:38.256
Long story.

27:43.794 --> 27:44.829
What are you doin' here?

27:45.462 --> 27:47.296
That door's not supposed
to be unlocked.

27:47.298 --> 27:50.966
And I told you, this theater is off-limits.
And that's my iPod.

27:50.968 --> 27:52.101
You took that
without my permission.

27:52.103 --> 27:53.969
I'm sorry.

27:53.971 --> 27:56.004
Look, I bring you into my house
and treat you just like my own.

27:56.006 --> 27:57.472
And the first chance you get,
you burn me.

27:57.474 --> 27:59.274
- What's going on down here?
- Let me explain.

27:59.276 --> 28:01.680
Speak up. Come on.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.113
I was practicing for you, okay?

28:04.115 --> 28:07.115
Practicing what? Come on.

28:07.117 --> 28:08.816
In your class,

28:08.818 --> 28:11.423
you talked about a competition,
right, with a cash prize?

28:12.923 --> 28:13.391
So...

28:17.127 --> 28:17.861
I thought I could win.

28:19.529 --> 28:22.200
Use the money to help you out,
so the bank doesn't...

28:24.835 --> 28:25.703
You know.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.975
You're a pretty sharp kid,
you know?

28:33.243 --> 28:34.977
I'm 12. I know stuff.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.885
Oh, that's very nice of you,
kid, but unfortunately...

28:42.486 --> 28:44.385
it's gonna take more
than $40,000

28:44.387 --> 28:45.823
to get me out of this hole.

28:48.858 --> 28:50.994
Hey, come with me.
Got something to show you.

28:53.364 --> 28:54.429
Go on.

29:00.037 --> 29:01.139
What size shoe you wear?

29:02.071 --> 29:02.806
Seven or eight.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.382
You're a pack rat, huh?

29:12.482 --> 29:13.384
Oh, no, I'm not.

29:14.484 --> 29:15.519
My brother is.

29:16.554 --> 29:17.989
He lives in that old
dressing room over there.

29:20.057 --> 29:21.192
- He does?
- Yep.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.531
We used to have an act
back in the '70s.

29:29.066 --> 29:31.269
This is all of our stuff.

29:34.204 --> 29:35.139
Wait a minute.

29:36.406 --> 29:37.307
Here.

29:39.108 --> 29:40.477
That's a good one. Try these on.

29:42.212 --> 29:44.112
Seriously?

29:44.114 --> 29:45.447
I don't want you wearing those
raggedy old things all day,

29:45.449 --> 29:47.615
and don't mistake
kindness for weakness.

29:47.617 --> 29:49.052
You're gonna earn those shoes.

29:50.554 --> 29:52.190
First thing in the morning,
we're going to training...

29:53.223 --> 29:54.958
and get your feet to work.

29:57.361 --> 30:01.266
So, back in the day, were
you and your brother famous?

30:01.598 --> 30:03.067
We had a few fans.

30:04.634 --> 30:06.203
Did you guys have
a big fight, or something?

30:07.503 --> 30:08.438
What makes you think that?

30:10.406 --> 30:13.477
Me and Albee fight,
but after, we make up.

30:17.248 --> 30:18.817
What happens
if you can't make up?

30:20.584 --> 30:21.486
We squash it.

30:24.587 --> 30:25.455
- We're family...
- Gramps?

30:26.522 --> 30:28.492
- Gramps, you need to come upstairs quick.
- Hmm? Oh!

30:37.433 --> 30:39.934
Like I said, I didn't arrest him

30:39.936 --> 30:42.136
because, you know,
one, the paperwork.

30:42.138 --> 30:45.140
Two, I used to puff at that age
but I never inhaled.

30:45.142 --> 30:46.177
Yeah, yeah.

30:47.678 --> 30:49.544
Hey, you sure
you don't wanna keep these?

30:49.546 --> 30:51.216
It's all right.
I already helped myself.

30:51.448 --> 30:52.984
Yeah? Let me see.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.919
"Devouring children
one chimney at a time."

30:56.921 --> 30:58.088
I love stupid horror movies.

30:58.422 --> 31:00.625
But it'll probably suck.

31:05.128 --> 31:07.496
The next guy who busts him,
though, he might not be so nice.

31:07.498 --> 31:08.930
Thanks, man.

31:08.932 --> 31:10.034
- Take care, Mr. B.
- Take care.

31:24.714 --> 31:26.347
<i>But it's not
that big of a deal.</i>

31:26.349 --> 31:27.651
Here's the rule,
here's the rule.

31:29.553 --> 31:32.190
You be quiet and I speak, okay?

31:32.722 --> 31:35.556
You got very lucky today,
very lucky.

31:35.558 --> 31:38.962
I decided to give you
a second chance. Hmm.

31:39.529 --> 31:41.228
Now, as long
as your father's away

31:41.230 --> 31:42.333
and you respect my family...

31:44.167 --> 31:45.232
you have a home with us,

31:45.234 --> 31:47.971
wherever that might be,
all right?

31:48.172 --> 31:50.642
You go, help the kids
wash those dishes.

31:58.548 --> 32:02.119
Hey! Hey! Excuse me! Um...

32:02.752 --> 32:04.353
Do the Bryant Brothers
still live here?

32:04.355 --> 32:05.420
Hey, listen, come back!

32:05.422 --> 32:07.258
I know someone
they need to meet!

32:10.027 --> 32:13.163
Uncle Greg, one of your
crazy fans is lurking outside.

32:17.734 --> 32:18.568
<i>Who is it?</i>

32:19.103 --> 32:19.637
It's me.

32:20.636 --> 32:21.638
Your only friend.

32:29.113 --> 32:29.614
Thank you.

32:34.617 --> 32:36.653
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

32:37.788 --> 32:39.324
Hey, why are you locking
your door all of a sudden?

32:40.656 --> 32:44.162
In case one of Miles's transient
crackers sneaks back here.

32:44.795 --> 32:47.161
Well, they're not
juvenile delinquents.

32:47.163 --> 32:48.566
They're just two kids
from school.

32:50.299 --> 32:51.068
Whatever.

32:52.336 --> 32:53.304
Can I eat this now?

32:54.270 --> 32:57.107
You can... after you
tell me your decision.

33:01.345 --> 33:02.447
I'm gonna pass.

33:04.681 --> 33:07.215
You're gonna pass on having
Christmas dinner with your family?

33:07.217 --> 33:09.721
Been passing for years.
Why stop now?

33:11.320 --> 33:13.590
Mom was right. You two are
worse than small children.

33:16.727 --> 33:17.628
How's it looking in here?

33:19.829 --> 33:23.198
You promised to start throwing
this stuff out, Uncle Greg.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.670
And you promised
to take voice lessons from me.

33:29.338 --> 33:30.207
Touché.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.312
I guess stubbornness
runs in the family.

33:38.582 --> 33:39.450
Night, Faith.

33:40.384 --> 33:41.349
Just one more thing.

33:41.351 --> 33:42.487
Hmm?

33:43.653 --> 33:46.057
I'm not gonna be bringing
Christmas dinner down this year.

33:47.657 --> 33:49.257
So, unless you wanna go hungry,

33:49.259 --> 33:50.560
you're gonna
have to come up for it.

33:59.702 --> 34:01.769
When you first walk
into the theater,

34:01.771 --> 34:03.473
you have to take a deep breath,
all right?

34:03.807 --> 34:06.373
Let's do that first.
Take a deep breath.

34:06.375 --> 34:08.376
Breathe it in. One, two, three.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.148
Now you are home.

34:14.150 --> 34:15.784
Actually, it's my home!

34:15.786 --> 34:17.619
You supposed to stay upstairs!

34:17.621 --> 34:18.887
Be quiet, you old grump.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.525
We'll be out of your hair
in a little while.

34:21.791 --> 34:22.726
Hey, Greg.

34:23.527 --> 34:24.628
Wherever you are.

34:28.831 --> 34:30.565
All right,
let's get this thing started.

34:30.567 --> 34:31.668
Get up there on stage.

34:35.771 --> 34:37.174
I've noticed
three things about you.

34:38.775 --> 34:41.445
First thing, you got no rhythm.

34:42.378 --> 34:44.246
Second thing,
you can't take choreography,

34:44.248 --> 34:46.250
and the third thing is
you don't know how to tap.

34:47.451 --> 34:49.353
- I can tap. Watch this.
- Let's see.

34:55.858 --> 34:57.594
That's very, very bad.

34:58.327 --> 35:01.396
You gonna listen to me now? You're
gonna tap on your right foot.

35:01.398 --> 35:05.833
Now, it's just brush,
spank, step.

35:05.835 --> 35:07.568
Let's see it.
Let's start. Brush.

35:07.570 --> 35:08.603
- Let me see.
- Brush.

35:08.605 --> 35:09.574
- Yeah, spank.
- Spank.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.608
- Brush, spank, step.
- Step. There you go.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.644
No, lemme... Loosen this up,
loosen it up for me.

35:15.646 --> 35:17.281
Loosen it up. Come on.

35:17.614 --> 35:20.715
- Brush, spank, step.
- Spank.

35:20.717 --> 35:22.686
All right. Speed that up.
Let me see that. Brush.

35:23.719 --> 35:26.588
- Brush, spank, step.
- All right, stop, stop.

35:26.590 --> 35:28.623
You know your left foot and right
foot have got to go together.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.458
Let me see the right foot
and then the left foot

35:30.460 --> 35:31.860
and see
if you can make them match.

35:31.862 --> 35:32.896
Come on, let's go, come on.

35:34.630 --> 35:35.500
Left.

35:36.900 --> 35:37.898
You're gonna make me throw up.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.336
Gee whiz.

35:40.269 --> 35:41.903
Whoa! We got
a lot of work to do, boy.

35:41.905 --> 35:43.438
Let's go.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.805
We're gonna get there,
not to worry.

35:44.807 --> 35:45.974
What's this breathing? Come on.

35:45.976 --> 35:47.041
You said,
breathe in the theater.

35:47.043 --> 35:49.279
Okay, breathe in the theater.
Come on, let's go.

35:49.813 --> 35:50.780
You finished breathing?

35:52.349 --> 35:53.885
Come on, let's go. Brush.

35:55.619 --> 35:56.952
Hey. Now the other one.

35:59.289 --> 36:00.854
All right. There's
some hard work to do now.

36:00.856 --> 36:03.825
You following the tradition
of some great tap dancers.

36:03.827 --> 36:05.726
So you can't be playing
that cute card.

36:05.728 --> 36:06.897
You are going
to have to produce.

36:36.527 --> 36:37.295

- Have you heard of knocking?

36:38.961 --> 36:42.333
I did. Those must be some
pretty serious headphones.

36:43.699 --> 36:44.568
Yeah.

36:44.967 --> 36:46.568
Yeah, they're pretty good.

36:46.570 --> 36:47.638
Man, you got some pipes.

36:48.704 --> 36:49.838
Thanks.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.807
Sing something else.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.742
No. Bye, Albee.

36:53.744 --> 36:55.446
No, hey. Come on.
Don't be like that.

36:55.911 --> 36:57.711
I'll be however I want.
Now, remove yourself.

37:07.690 --> 37:08.358
All right.

37:11.494 --> 37:11.996
Good set.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.595
We got a long way

37:14.597 --> 37:16.530
if we're gonna make any noise
in that competition.

37:16.532 --> 37:18.867
But I'll teach you the rest
of the choreography tomorrow.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.004
And thank you.

37:20.403 --> 37:21.838
Too bad
you teachin' him all wrong.

37:24.641 --> 37:25.710
What you got to say about it?

37:26.476 --> 37:26.978
Plenty.

37:28.711 --> 37:31.514
Watch... and learn.

37:33.516 --> 37:34.317
Kid...

37:35.686 --> 37:39.457
The step... is not this.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.594
No, no, no.

37:46.596 --> 37:49.934
The step... is this.

38:02.913 --> 38:04.548
It's called showmanship.

38:07.117 --> 38:09.019
This one gonna teach
you a lot of bad habits.

38:09.753 --> 38:13.024
If I was you, kid, I'd be
looking for a new teacher.

38:15.425 --> 38:16.594
You're pretty good.

38:17.693 --> 38:20.331
Hey, wanna come
to the Best of the Boroughs?

38:20.563 --> 38:21.565
I'm competing in it.

38:22.798 --> 38:23.867
Thanks, but...

38:25.969 --> 38:27.605
I don't get out much these days.

38:32.943 --> 38:33.811
What?

38:37.646 --> 38:39.349
I haven't seen my brother
dance in a long time.

39:20.824 --> 39:22.526
Good. Go. Is that it?

39:23.460 --> 39:24.862
Keep it up,
don't stop, don't stop.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.483
Eat your heart out,
Bill Bojangles Robinson.

40:42.271 --> 40:43.871
- Come on, let me treat you.
- Absolutely not.

40:43.873 --> 40:44.741
You know you want to.

40:57.554 --> 40:59.190
Over the leg, slap the floor.

40:59.755 --> 41:01.192
This is Greg's favorite step,
you got to do it.

41:10.733 --> 41:11.733
- What?
- Don't do that.

41:11.735 --> 41:12.736
Fine.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.106
Yeah.

41:24.748 --> 41:25.583
Looking good.

41:27.150 --> 41:28.749
Think I'm creating
a monster here.

41:45.735 --> 41:46.269
Albee?

41:49.105 --> 41:50.007
Hey.

41:50.806 --> 41:51.805
Hmm?

41:51.807 --> 41:52.675
What?

41:55.344 --> 41:56.646
You think Dad's all right?

41:59.148 --> 42:00.284
I'm sure he's fine.

42:01.318 --> 42:02.219
Go to sleep.

42:24.273 --> 42:25.141
Excuse me.

42:26.842 --> 42:28.108
I didn't mean to startle you,

42:28.110 --> 42:29.179
but are you
Miles or Greg Bryant?

42:32.248 --> 42:33.182
Maybe.

42:35.150 --> 42:36.052
What's it to you?

42:37.253 --> 42:38.322
Longtime fan.

42:43.025 --> 42:44.157
Yeah, you must be.

42:44.159 --> 42:46.696
We sure don't have
that many new ones.

42:47.963 --> 42:49.065
Greg Bryant.

42:50.099 --> 42:51.568
This is your final notice.

42:52.936 --> 42:54.904
You have until January 2nd to
bring your account up to date...

42:55.105 --> 42:57.041
or the sheriff's gonna remove
you from the property.

43:05.148 --> 43:06.016
That was cold.

43:07.951 --> 43:09.083
You didn't have to pretend.

43:09.085 --> 43:10.220
It's not pretend.

43:11.387 --> 43:12.920
I grew up in this neighborhood

43:12.922 --> 43:14.724
and I remember coming
to this theater as a kid.

43:20.195 --> 43:22.199
- January 2nd, huh?
- Correct.

43:24.099 --> 43:25.702
Well, I hope you guys
figure something out.

43:26.735 --> 43:27.770
I'll be prayin' for you.

43:35.844 --> 43:36.346
Miles...

43:52.762 --> 43:54.131
So, why don't you
sing in public? Hmm?

43:56.099 --> 43:57.365
Who said
I don't sing in public?

43:57.367 --> 43:58.235
Me.

43:59.536 --> 44:01.903
Well, you don't even know me.
So your opinion doesn't matter.

44:01.905 --> 44:04.274
Wow. Why are you
always so stuck-up to me?

44:05.175 --> 44:06.076
I'm not stuck-up.

44:06.443 --> 44:07.344
Then answer my question.

44:11.313 --> 44:14.183
My family are kinda
like Broadway legends.

44:15.284 --> 44:17.184
Exactly. So what's the problem?

44:17.186 --> 44:19.086
They probably have like
a ton of connections, right?

44:19.088 --> 44:21.858
Yeah, except everyone would
compare me to them and I just...

44:22.458 --> 44:24.858
I just don't think I can handle those
kinds of expectations, you know?

44:24.860 --> 44:25.695
Lame.

44:26.829 --> 44:28.297
- Excuse you?
- It's a lame excuse.

44:29.798 --> 44:31.668
You got a great voice, Faith.

44:33.135 --> 44:33.936
Don't waste it.

44:37.273 --> 44:38.271
I'm gonna stop you.

44:38.273 --> 44:40.141
- Nope. Come on.
- No.

44:40.143 --> 44:42.012
- You're spillin' my hot chocolate.
- I don't care.

44:42.778 --> 44:44.778
- I'm not gonna sing.
- Yes, you are.

44:44.780 --> 44:46.981
You're gonna sing, I'm gonna sing,
we are gonna <i>Glee</i> this shit up.

44:46.983 --> 44:48.782
Hey, is it cool
if we sing with you guys?

44:48.784 --> 44:50.016
- Albee, no.
- Cool, thank you.

44:50.018 --> 44:51.853
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great!

44:51.855 --> 44:53.521
And I'm gonna do it
with you, okay?

46:16.338 --> 46:17.541
The contender.

46:34.923 --> 46:36.226
I've done my time.

46:36.925 --> 46:40.061
Well, look at you, huh?
Well, aren't we fancy?

46:40.063 --> 46:41.131
Where you going, Applebee's?

46:41.898 --> 46:43.930
No, we're going to a show.

I got the Pacer back,
we're good.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.867
Where'd you get the money?

46:46.869 --> 46:48.237
I paid a visit
to the blood bank.

46:48.570 --> 46:51.271
Sperm bank wouldn't take me.

46:51.273 --> 46:53.441
So, you can say
thank you to Mr. B.

46:53.443 --> 46:55.275
Get your things together,
we're outta here.

46:55.277 --> 46:57.144
No, we're not going
with you, Dad.

46:57.146 --> 46:59.016
Aaron's dancin' in the competition
tonight, that's the show.

46:59.414 --> 47:02.349
It's kind of a big deal and we're
actually running late, so...

47:02.351 --> 47:03.286
You wanna come?

47:05.355 --> 47:06.856
Not to no dance competition.

47:07.422 --> 47:08.655
Fine.

47:08.657 --> 47:10.191
But Mr. B has been training me.

47:10.193 --> 47:13.193
Yeah, well, your prancing days
are over, twinkle toes.

47:13.195 --> 47:14.297
Let's go. Come on!

47:16.431 --> 47:17.898
He's not goin' with you.

47:17.900 --> 47:19.633
- Oh, you're a big man now?
- Bigger than you.

47:19.635 --> 47:21.505
Hey, Albee, back off.

47:23.505 --> 47:24.373
Hey.

47:26.009 --> 47:27.675
Why don't you
let your kid compete?

47:27.677 --> 47:29.479
We'll talk about
the details later, okay?

47:29.978 --> 47:31.979
- Who died and made you king?
- Ah...

47:31.981 --> 47:33.481
I said you could watch my kids,
not keep 'em.

47:33.483 --> 47:35.349
No, man, it's not like that.

47:35.351 --> 47:37.952
You know, he worked real hard.
You should see him, man.

47:37.954 --> 47:40.621
I don't wanna see no son
of mine dance on no damn stage.

47:40.623 --> 47:41.956
Stay here for a couple of days,

47:41.958 --> 47:43.193
there's room in the theater.

47:44.327 --> 47:45.458
At least until you get
on your feet. How about that?

47:45.460 --> 47:47.630
Screw him, Mr. B. He's a bum.

47:49.364 --> 47:51.601
Oh, I really wish
you had died instead of Mom.

47:52.635 --> 47:53.871
You want me to die?

47:57.373 --> 47:58.472
- You keep 'em.
- No, Randy...

47:58.474 --> 48:00.106
- I'm outta here. No!
- Randy!

48:00.108 --> 48:01.641
No, Dad!

48:01.643 --> 48:03.479
- No!
- Let him go. Let him go.

48:31.139 --> 48:33.676
All right, you and Albee
go find some place to sit, okay?

48:35.043 --> 48:38.412
Me and Aaron are
gonna go and check in.

48:38.414 --> 48:40.417
- Kill it, little man.
- Break a leg.

48:42.150 --> 48:43.386
Stay strong. Let's go.

49:12.782 --> 49:13.951
Such an alpha bottom.

49:15.318 --> 49:16.717
You need to be more of a Glinda.

49:16.719 --> 49:19.519
I am a Glinda on a good
occasion. Let me be alpha...

49:19.521 --> 49:20.657
Oh, my God. Look who it is.

49:24.027 --> 49:25.092
- Mr. Bryant!
- No.

49:25.094 --> 49:26.730
There's an open seat right here.

49:27.563 --> 49:28.795
Would you do us the honor?

49:33.769 --> 49:34.637
Thanks.

49:42.545 --> 49:43.747
My name is Christian.

49:44.813 --> 49:47.213
I'm a huge musical-theater fan.

49:47.215 --> 49:48.719
Oh, could you tell?

49:50.353 --> 49:53.686
I'm Basil, and you'll have
to forgive my partner here,

49:53.688 --> 49:55.157
he's really drunk.

49:56.793 --> 49:57.728
Anyway...

49:59.461 --> 50:01.228
You know, it's kinda funny
that I'd run into you here

50:01.230 --> 50:03.463
because just a few days ago,

50:03.465 --> 50:06.469
I was outside the Bryant Theater
looking for you and Miles.

50:09.704 --> 50:11.505
I think I might've
scared your daughter.

50:11.507 --> 50:12.541
She's your daughter, right?

50:13.643 --> 50:16.177
I mean, I was late and
it was dark, but I didn't...

50:16.179 --> 50:17.681
Would you leave the
nice man alone, please?

50:19.382 --> 50:21.617
Does the name "Frank
Goodman" ring a bell?

50:23.652 --> 50:24.553
Of course.

50:26.289 --> 50:27.024
How you know him?

50:28.858 --> 50:29.793
This is his son.

50:34.297 --> 50:34.764
Really?

50:37.532 --> 50:39.702
Your daddy was
the best manager we ever had.

50:41.637 --> 50:42.672
Like family.

50:47.476 --> 50:49.175
Yeah!

50:49.177 --> 50:51.545
<i>Representing the
Stages Performing Arts School...</i>

50:51.547 --> 50:52.782
- Guys are good.
- Yeah.

50:59.155 --> 51:00.524
It looks good,
but something's missing.

51:02.224 --> 51:02.759
You know what that is?

51:03.592 --> 51:04.460
Huh?

51:08.898 --> 51:09.733
It's dance.

51:11.333 --> 51:12.635
How is dance missing?

51:13.902 --> 51:17.771
Dance is a homeless kid who
hooked up with a street drummer

51:17.773 --> 51:19.709
so he could make some
change and feed himself.

51:20.510 --> 51:21.411
It's family.

51:23.846 --> 51:27.117
It's a kid dancin' the truth.

51:29.418 --> 51:31.621
What do you feel
right here and right now?

51:33.222 --> 51:33.757
Use it.

51:35.557 --> 51:36.590
You dance it.

51:40.228 --> 51:40.864
Hey.

51:42.231 --> 51:45.532
Tell your story. Okay?

51:45.534 --> 51:47.870
<i>Please welcome Aaron Davis.</i>

51:54.443 --> 51:55.278
<i>Easy, now.</i>

52:05.588 --> 52:06.723
<i>You're a pretty sharp kid.</i>

52:10.760 --> 52:12.129
<i>Your mother
was so beautiful.</i>

52:12.961 --> 52:14.498
<i>You shoulda seen her smile.</i>

52:23.472 --> 52:24.908
<i>You're gonna crush it
tomorrow, little man.</i>

52:29.911 --> 52:31.744
<i>This is gonna hurt me
more than it hurts you</i>

52:31.746 --> 52:33.215
<i>if you don't do it just right.</i>

52:33.583 --> 52:35.184
<i>You think I can
take dance next year?</i>

52:47.797 --> 52:49.398
<i>Tell your story.</i>

52:51.666 --> 52:53.733
<i>I don't wanna see no son
of mine dance on no damn stage.</i>

52:53.735 --> 52:55.769
<i>It'll take more than
$40,000 to get me outta this hole.</i>

52:55.771 --> 52:57.807
<i>What, do you think
you're good? Well, you're not!</i>

53:00.443 --> 53:01.344
<i>Dad!</i>

53:09.652 --> 53:10.686
<i>You want me to die?</i>

53:11.987 --> 53:13.019
<i>Done.</i>

53:19.362 --> 53:20.329
It's just so loud.

53:46.621 --> 53:50.824
Well, um...
next up is Blue Crew.

53:50.826 --> 53:51.758
Yeah!

54:22.757 --> 54:23.692
What happened out there?

54:25.827 --> 54:26.762
Nothing.

54:28.030 --> 54:29.432
Didn't look like nothing to me.

54:33.436 --> 54:34.971
Why'd you run away
like that, son?

54:37.606 --> 54:39.572
Because I don't wanna
do this anymore!

54:39.574 --> 54:43.876
I hope you lose your small,
tiny, shitty, crappy theater!

54:43.878 --> 54:45.713
I'd rather sleep in my dad's car

54:45.715 --> 54:47.751
than listen
to one more of your lectures!

54:48.617 --> 54:49.385
Son!

54:52.588 --> 54:53.723
They're announcing
the winners!

55:09.637 --> 55:11.473
Before I announce the winner...

55:12.507 --> 55:14.643
I'd like to congratulate
all of our dancers.

55:14.976 --> 55:18.947
The winner of this year's
Best Of The Boroughs is...

55:24.119 --> 55:25.422
Travis Diaz.

55:26.822 --> 55:27.755
Yeah!

55:27.757 --> 55:29.693
Yo, you go, T!

56:00.922 --> 56:01.824
Hey!

56:04.659 --> 56:05.362
Aaron.

56:06.661 --> 56:08.195
Aaron!

56:08.197 --> 56:09.463
- That's it, I'm outta here.
- Yeah, call the car.

56:09.465 --> 56:10.432
Come on. Let's go.

56:11.434 --> 56:12.435
Move it!

56:15.137 --> 56:16.139
Well, this isn't working.

56:17.172 --> 56:18.107
Let's get the hell outta here.

56:23.913 --> 56:26.516
Everyone, please stay seated.
The situation is under control.

56:29.818 --> 56:30.686
Hey!

56:32.086 --> 56:34.588
Slow down, man.
Come on! Hey, hey, hey!

56:34.590 --> 56:35.525
What are you doin', huh?

56:38.494 --> 56:39.525
Where are you goin'?

56:59.014 --> 57:01.050
I'm glad you didn't
want to go back to Mr. B's.

57:02.751 --> 57:03.586
I can't.

57:05.788 --> 57:06.923
Not yet.

57:08.023 --> 57:10.159
I know the feeling. Faith's
gonna tear me a new one.

57:26.909 --> 57:27.577
Look at this.

57:34.282 --> 57:35.083
He never forgets.

57:37.552 --> 57:38.987
Yeah, he'll surprise you
now and then.

57:54.536 --> 57:55.637
I'm ready.

57:58.039 --> 57:59.041
Me too.

58:04.947 --> 58:05.882
Bye, Mom.

58:12.054 --> 58:13.722
So, what was that
all about back there, huh?

58:15.023 --> 58:15.891
Well...

58:17.826 --> 58:19.226
I'm not supposed to tell you,

58:19.228 --> 58:22.130
but Mr. B really needed
that money.

58:23.632 --> 58:26.999
- What?
- Yeah, so apparently...

58:27.001 --> 58:28.568
You spent
all of our money

58:28.570 --> 58:29.670
but didn't have the balls
to tell me?

58:29.672 --> 58:32.104
Faith, you just watch
your language, don't be coarse.

58:32.106 --> 58:33.141
Oh, I'm sorry.

58:34.143 --> 58:36.646
You... You don't get
to lecture me. Not tonight.

58:37.646 --> 58:39.949
No, you forfeited
that privilege.

58:43.885 --> 58:45.851
Baby girl, please, come on
out here and let's talk.

58:45.853 --> 58:47.720
Greg had no right to interfere.

58:47.722 --> 58:49.356
- Now you wanna talk?
- Yeah.

58:49.358 --> 58:50.026
Okay.

58:50.693 --> 58:52.025
Well, then let's start with you

58:52.027 --> 58:54.695
explaining why you lied to me
for however long.

58:54.697 --> 58:55.965
When were you gonna
break the news, Gramps?

58:57.132 --> 58:58.735
When the sheriff
showed up to evict us?

59:00.268 --> 59:03.005
You were the one who always
said we should never lie...

59:03.972 --> 59:04.940
never keep secrets.

59:07.108 --> 59:08.210
I guess
that didn't apply to you.

59:10.878 --> 59:14.284
So what I wanna know
is what are we going to do?

59:14.882 --> 59:16.215
We got a lot to figure out.

59:16.217 --> 59:17.851
- Yeah. Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

59:17.853 --> 59:19.322
That's an understatement.

59:20.822 --> 59:21.958
We don't have anywhere to live.

59:23.324 --> 59:24.691
We have to find a new apartment,

59:24.693 --> 59:26.262
we have to find people
to help us move!

59:28.063 --> 59:30.567
- Shh. Calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

59:32.867 --> 59:35.237
Okay. Okay. So let me
get this straight.

59:38.373 --> 59:40.175
You blew
all of my college money.

59:41.976 --> 59:45.181
You've been lying to my face,
and you want me to calm down?

59:47.650 --> 59:49.719
Gramps, we're gonna
be homeless in a week.

59:51.186 --> 59:52.055
I...

59:55.289 --> 59:57.059
I can't believe you call
yourself a role model.

59:57.726 --> 59:58.294
I really...

01:00:54.248 --> 01:00:57.717
You... ever get the feeling

01:00:57.719 --> 01:00:59.655
that your whole world
is collapsing...

01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:02.224
and that you're the architect?

01:01:05.393 --> 01:01:07.295
- You should've told me, Gramps.
- Tell you what?

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:10.266
We're gonna lose the house?

01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:15.138
What kind of thing is that
to tell your granddaughter?

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.076
I took those boys
off the street...

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.980
and now I'm gonna put 'em
right back on the street...

01:01:26.114 --> 01:01:27.949
and we're gonna
go along with them.

01:01:31.887 --> 01:01:32.722
It's hopeless.

01:01:34.956 --> 01:01:35.824
Gramps.

01:01:36.858 --> 01:01:37.793
Gramps.

01:01:43.331 --> 01:01:44.299
There's always hope.

01:01:50.838 --> 01:01:56.411
I know things seem bleak, but
the storm will pass, right?

01:02:00.382 --> 01:02:02.952
The only way to start the next
chapter is to turn the page.

01:02:07.222 --> 01:02:08.157
You taught me that.

01:02:13.128 --> 01:02:13.963
I taught you that?

01:02:15.297 --> 01:02:16.295
Are you sure?

01:02:16.297 --> 01:02:17.165
Yeah.

01:02:24.505 --> 01:02:26.408
Okay.

01:02:35.217 --> 01:02:36.249
Okay.

01:03:16.123 --> 01:03:17.392
Gramps wants to see you
in the theater, Aaron.

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:26.134
Just couldn't help yourself,
could you?

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.538
Had to assault that poor guy.

01:03:30.338 --> 01:03:31.306
He was a douche.

01:03:32.273 --> 01:03:33.206
Aaron deserved to win.

01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:34.076
No, he didn't.

01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:36.144
What? It's the truth.

01:03:38.112 --> 01:03:41.082
And... what are you gonna do
if they press charges?

01:03:41.315 --> 01:03:42.551
Take it like a man.

01:03:43.117 --> 01:03:45.887
Look, can you just be
serious for, like, a minute?

01:03:46.153 --> 01:03:48.190
God, what crawled
up in your ass and died?

01:03:50.057 --> 01:03:52.862
I'm sorry, I thought
you actually wanted to change.

01:03:53.128 --> 01:03:56.662
I do, but in case you forgot,
our dad ditched us yesterday.

01:03:56.664 --> 01:03:57.532
Right.

01:03:58.599 --> 01:04:00.469
And you think you're
the only one who's had it rough?

01:04:01.903 --> 01:04:03.168
God help me.
How blind can you be?

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:05.170
I don't know, but I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:06.274
How 'bout this?

01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:08.941
The bank's
foreclosing on the theater

01:04:08.943 --> 01:04:10.610
and kicking us out
in the beginning of January,

01:04:10.612 --> 01:04:12.081
and we have no idea
what we're gonna do.

01:04:17.018 --> 01:04:18.620
Buy an RV
and take the show on the road?

01:04:20.922 --> 01:04:21.623
Would you stop?

01:04:22.557 --> 01:04:24.423
This isn't a joke, Albee.
You know what?

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.992
You need to grow up
and stop running around

01:04:26.994 --> 01:04:29.162
like some
little freeloading punk

01:04:29.164 --> 01:04:31.601
who thinks he's some sort
of Casanova, 'cause you're not.

01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:35.503
Wow.

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:38.007
Albee, I didn't mean that.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.215
Sorry about all that bad stuff
I said.

01:04:50.418 --> 01:04:52.989
You know, that stunt you pulled
last night, it was not okay.

01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:58.057
But Albee punched someone.

01:04:58.059 --> 01:04:59.362
That ain't got nothing
to do with what you did.

01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:02.130
You let your emotions
overcome you.

01:05:02.697 --> 01:05:05.367
Last night,
you lost control of your story.

01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:08.336
Hey. Look at me.

01:05:10.304 --> 01:05:11.606
You're gonna get there.
You know that, don't you?

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:14.076
Hey, hey.

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.579
You are going to get there.

01:05:17.244 --> 01:05:19.079
Okay? All right,
now, let's get up here.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:20.316
Come on. Come on.

01:05:29.224 --> 01:05:30.523
This is yours.

01:05:30.525 --> 01:05:32.191
You act up like that again,

01:05:32.193 --> 01:05:33.396
I'll have you clean up
this whole damn neighborhood.

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:34.693
Take it.

01:05:34.695 --> 01:05:35.996
What's the point?

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:38.034
The point is, this is our home.

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:39.534
Take the mop.

01:05:41.503 --> 01:05:42.605
You get to work.

01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:29.444
What are you doin' here?

01:07:31.512 --> 01:07:32.181
Just lookin'.

01:07:35.617 --> 01:07:36.685
So this is it.

01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:39.687
This is what?

01:07:40.822 --> 01:07:41.690
Where you live.

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:53.536
Don't touch it.

01:07:58.239 --> 01:07:59.207
You did movies too?

01:08:02.911 --> 01:08:04.179
I thought
you didn't get out much.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:09.617
I used to get out a lot.

01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:12.721
Back in the day.

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:16.792
I had quite a reputation.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:24.866
I hope I can dance
like you one day.

01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:28.671
Well...

01:08:30.438 --> 01:08:33.809
you keep workin' hard,
maybe you'll get there...

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:39.115
If your brother
don't screw you up first.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.751
What do you mean?

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.389
Nothing. Never mind.

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:49.256
Story time's over, kid.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:05.341
Hey, Aaron. Look at this.

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:10.746
You know, Miles was
a renaissance man.

01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:14.582
Directing, choreographing,
he did it all.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:16.917
But...

01:09:18.353 --> 01:09:19.622
Greg's the one they came to see.

01:09:20.386 --> 01:09:21.390
He was the headliner.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:24.326
There was a car accident, right?

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:28.796
Yeah. Gramps fell asleep
at the wheel.

01:09:30.465 --> 01:09:32.167
I mean, he came out
of it all right, but...

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.670
Uncle Greg, he...

01:09:35.703 --> 01:09:37.171
He hurt his back pretty bad.

01:09:37.805 --> 01:09:38.907
Never went on stage again.

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:44.947
Where have you been?

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:49.848
Thinking.

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.353
Well, while you've been
jerkin' off...

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:53.488
I cleaned up the whole theater.

01:09:53.688 --> 01:09:56.658
Well, actually that's exactly
what I was thinking about.

01:09:56.957 --> 01:09:58.357
Yeah, I bet.

01:09:58.359 --> 01:09:59.862
I'm talking about the theater,
smart-ass!

01:10:01.895 --> 01:10:03.331
We gotta figure
this thing out.

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:04.964
You know what, Albee?
Can you just help us pack?

01:10:04.966 --> 01:10:06.202
No, listen.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:08.968
My boy Corey's raising money
for his sister on Indiegogo.

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:11.874
You can make, like,
a ton of money on there.

01:10:14.442 --> 01:10:16.009
Okay, but don't we need
some kind of incentive

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.980
to encourage people
to donate money?

01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:20.816
Yeah.

01:10:24.886 --> 01:10:25.955
I know what we could do.

01:10:41.002 --> 01:10:42.838
So that's what they're
calling music these days?

01:10:43.938 --> 01:10:44.974
What, you don't like hip-hop?

01:10:45.873 --> 01:10:49.244
No. I don't. I like soul.

01:10:50.011 --> 01:10:51.480
But you wouldn't
know nothing 'bout that.

01:10:52.413 --> 01:10:53.948
- Hip-hop has soul.
- Yeah.

01:10:54.582 --> 01:10:57.353
- Run-DMC, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube.
- Greg.

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:00.889
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
Greg, come back here. Greg!

01:11:03.024 --> 01:11:04.627
I got something to show you.
Come on.

01:11:05.726 --> 01:11:06.427
Look at this.

01:11:10.431 --> 01:11:10.932
Come on, look.

01:11:13.033 --> 01:11:13.868
You know what this is here?

01:11:14.636 --> 01:11:16.702
These kids here
are using our name

01:11:16.704 --> 01:11:18.673
to help raise money
so we can stay here.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.577
And so far,
they've raised over $2,000!

01:11:22.743 --> 01:11:24.512
People love this theater.

01:11:24.712 --> 01:11:26.414
And they wanna see you guys
back on stage again.

01:11:27.748 --> 01:11:28.617
I think it's worth a try.

01:11:29.684 --> 01:11:30.853
It could be our last shot.

01:11:32.753 --> 01:11:34.456
Y'all can do
this internet deal, but...

01:11:36.457 --> 01:11:37.623
we ain't performing again.

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:41.527
No. Don't nobody
wanna see that mess.

01:11:41.529 --> 01:11:42.464
I do.

01:11:44.565 --> 01:11:46.769
Well, let Aaron do it.

01:11:47.868 --> 01:11:49.902
Nobody really wants
to see Aaron.

01:11:49.904 --> 01:11:51.940
I'm just a kid. You're legends.

01:11:52.373 --> 01:11:53.474
And look at this.

01:11:54.641 --> 01:11:56.909
"The Bryant Brothers have been
in hibernation for too long.

01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:58.678
I can't wait
to see them perform again."

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.015
Look how many likes you got.

01:12:03.784 --> 01:12:04.586
Likes?

01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:08.090
I don't care
nothing about no likes.

01:12:10.524 --> 01:12:11.592
Do you care about me?

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:14.962
Of course I care about you.

01:12:17.931 --> 01:12:19.367
But maybe all this is for...

01:12:20.635 --> 01:12:21.670
the best.

01:12:27.675 --> 01:12:29.744
So I guess we won't be seeing
you for Christmas dinner, then.

01:12:38.118 --> 01:12:39.520
You just gonna let him go?

01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:45.594
It was a good idea, but maybe we
should start thinking about...

01:12:47.194 --> 01:12:48.697
packing up
and getting outta here.

01:13:11.752 --> 01:13:13.585
I know we said we weren't
doing presents this year,

01:13:13.587 --> 01:13:15.823
but I couldn't help myself.

01:13:19.726 --> 01:13:20.729
Merry Christmas.

01:13:21.662 --> 01:13:22.563
Thanks.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:24.867
Merry Christmas, Gramps.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.705
- Like it?
- Yeah, I love it.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.638
Are you sure you didn't
get our gifts mixed up?

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.809
Open yours, Gramps.

01:13:38.145 --> 01:13:40.815
What? Where did you find this?

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:44.116
- Albee helped me.
- I have my sources.

01:13:44.118 --> 01:13:45.154
Wow!

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:47.189
Can we play it?

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.222
I've got a turntable
in the bedroom.

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.490
Let's do this.

01:15:44.137 --> 01:15:45.039
It's your wake-up call.

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:49.642
Look, I know
it's Christmas morning,

01:15:49.644 --> 01:15:51.213
but if we're gonna do
this show...

01:15:54.247 --> 01:15:55.182
you better get to work.

01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.052
Yeah.

01:16:00.287 --> 01:16:01.155
All right!

01:16:03.858 --> 01:16:04.824
Yeah, you ready?

01:16:06.327 --> 01:16:07.229
- Let's get up.
- What you got?

01:16:08.863 --> 01:16:10.097
Bop-bop!

01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:13.398
You may have to adapt, Greg.
Come on.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.102
This is... I can't
go out like this, Miles.

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.769
I can't do it.
I can't embarrass myself.

01:16:17.771 --> 01:16:19.205
Let me talk to you, man.

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.906
Come on, man, this is years ago.

01:16:20.908 --> 01:16:22.775
You don't have to do
the big thing all the time.

01:16:22.777 --> 01:16:23.612
Take it easy.

01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:33.184
- Give me! Just give 'em to me.
- No!

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:35.754
- Just give 'em to me!
- No! Uncle Greg, we need...

01:16:35.756 --> 01:16:37.024
Let me see you
just sweep the floor.

01:16:37.692 --> 01:16:40.194
- Remember the shake and sweep?
- The sweep?

01:16:42.829 --> 01:16:43.698
Yeah!

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.735
<i>♪ Everybody ♪</i>

01:16:48.301 --> 01:16:49.170
Yeah.

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:51.273
Big show, Bryant Theater.

01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:54.406
<i>♪ Everybody, uh-huh ♪</i>

01:16:54.408 --> 01:16:56.342
Check, check. Check one, two.

01:16:56.344 --> 01:16:58.710
I know you're having fun,
but I'm gonna need you to step.

01:16:58.712 --> 01:16:59.711
Bam.

01:16:59.713 --> 01:17:00.247
Right?

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:03.050
All right?

01:17:03.717 --> 01:17:05.386
No, no. No, not my hat,
not my hat.

01:17:06.386 --> 01:17:08.255
- No!
- No! Faith, please!

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.394
Give me a "Hello, ladies."

01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:15.297
Hello, ladies.

01:17:16.963 --> 01:17:17.966
I'm done, y'all.

01:17:21.969 --> 01:17:24.271
- Bryant Brothers.
- Thank you ladies and gentlemen!

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.411
I don't know how I'm gonna get through
this show, though. I'm tired.

01:17:33.413 --> 01:17:35.983
Me too, man.
Let's go sit down somewhere.

01:17:46.493 --> 01:17:47.962
- Whoa!
- Hey!

01:17:48.462 --> 01:17:49.398
All right!

01:17:50.431 --> 01:17:51.966
Looks like we're
getting ready to do this again.

01:17:52.332 --> 01:17:53.398
Doin' it again.

01:18:09.283 --> 01:18:10.782
Oh, really?

01:18:10.784 --> 01:18:12.384
Uh-uh-uh!

01:18:12.386 --> 01:18:14.853
Knock it off. Pretty girl.

01:18:14.855 --> 01:18:15.923
- Gramps, look at this.
- What?

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:18.790
He raised $25,000 in a week

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:20.326
and that is not including
ticket sales.

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:21.927
Which should add up
to another ten grand.

01:18:21.929 --> 01:18:24.362
That means we have
another 60K to reach...

01:18:24.364 --> 01:18:26.866
We may have a situation here.

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:28.270
- What?
- Yeah.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.769
You guys hang tough.
I'll be right back.

01:18:30.771 --> 01:18:31.439
Okay.

01:18:35.342 --> 01:18:36.509
Here, let's go sit over here.

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:37.876
- Okay.
- This one here.

01:18:37.878 --> 01:18:39.178
This is so exciting.

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.849
I mean, the Bryant Brothers!

01:18:42.216 --> 01:18:44.183
<i>Chéri,</i> well, the last time
I saw you two this excited,

01:18:44.185 --> 01:18:47.055
Kristin Chenoweth was
selling a Crock-Pot on QVC.

01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:48.989
<i>Hey, man, open up.</i>

01:18:50.123 --> 01:18:51.292
The crowd's gettin' restless.

01:18:52.326 --> 01:18:53.826
We need to make an announcement.

01:18:53.828 --> 01:18:54.830
Ah, just give me a minute.

01:18:55.529 --> 01:18:56.398
Just a minute.

01:18:59.867 --> 01:19:01.903
Hey, Greg? Greggy!

01:19:05.539 --> 01:19:06.975
You try. He listens to you.

01:19:08.842 --> 01:19:09.510
Uncle Greg?

01:19:10.877 --> 01:19:12.443
You know you really
should see this crowd.

01:19:12.445 --> 01:19:14.381
- They're excited to see you...
- Leave me alone!

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:19.521
What's wrong?

01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:25.226
What's the point?

01:19:28.595 --> 01:19:30.798
The guy they came to see...

01:19:32.132 --> 01:19:32.666
is gone.

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:37.539
And he ain't coming back.

01:19:41.242 --> 01:19:42.543
Back me up, okay?

01:19:43.144 --> 01:19:45.313
- Come on.
- Baby, give me a minute.

01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:03.965
Hey, Greggy.

01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:05.399
Why don't you come on out?

01:20:08.269 --> 01:20:12.106
You remember when we first bought
this theater, back in '79?

01:20:12.506 --> 01:20:13.871
<i>People thought we was crazy</i>

01:20:13.873 --> 01:20:16.275
<i>trying to open up a community
theater in Bedford-Stuy.</i>

01:20:16.277 --> 01:20:18.078
<i>Yeah, we proved them wrong,
didn't we, man?</i>

01:20:19.313 --> 01:20:20.481
Stop with the...

01:20:21.916 --> 01:20:22.984
memory lane shit.

01:20:26.487 --> 01:20:28.519
- It don't have a happy ending.
- Oh, no, no.

01:20:28.521 --> 01:20:30.559
It can have a happy ending, man.

01:20:32.092 --> 01:20:35.093
It can if you come outta
that cave you got in there.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:36.530
There are kids up
there waiting on us.

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:44.605
<i>We're a family, man.
You can do this.</i>

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.341
I can't.

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.007
Yes, you can!

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.444
I can't do it!
I ain't got no feet!

01:20:52.279 --> 01:20:54.014
I'm an embarrassment to my name!

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:59.054
<i>It's because of you!
You did this!</i>

01:20:59.319 --> 01:21:00.487
You did this to me!

01:21:03.423 --> 01:21:04.626
Yeah, hey, Greg...

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:10.195
I'm sick and tired
of being sorry.

01:21:10.197 --> 01:21:12.665
<i>I've spent the last 30 years
apologizing to you.</i>

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:14.469
<i>I fell asleep at the wheel,
man, I'm sorry.</i>

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.304
I hurt myself too, man.

01:21:18.706 --> 01:21:20.242
I can't dance either.

01:21:21.242 --> 01:21:22.878
Gotta spend the rest
of my life with a cane, man.

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:25.512
<i>I got a job as a school teacher.</i>

01:21:27.715 --> 01:21:29.317
I'm trying to take care
of you, man.

01:21:31.551 --> 01:21:34.186
<i>So my granddaughter can come
and feed you</i>

01:21:34.188 --> 01:21:37.025
those freaking meals every day
when you hide in your dungeon.

01:21:38.492 --> 01:21:41.029
<i>It is not my fault
that you gave up on life.</i>

01:21:41.261 --> 01:21:43.497
<i>That you chose to hang out
with those groupies.</i>

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.900
It's not my fault
that you can't get up.

01:21:47.667 --> 01:21:49.101
Huh?

01:21:49.103 --> 01:21:50.568
- What you say?
- I said you can't get up anymore.

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:53.341
You wanna go, huh? You wanna...
Gimme this damn cane!

01:21:54.207 --> 01:21:55.507
- What you gonna do?
- When I'm finished with you,

01:21:55.509 --> 01:21:57.375
they're gonna put you in a home.
You understand?

01:21:57.377 --> 01:21:59.178
They're gonna put you
in a frigging home again!

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:00.345
- Stop it!
- Goddamn it!

01:22:00.347 --> 01:22:01.917
- What are you doing?
- Gimme this cane.

01:22:02.682 --> 01:22:04.549
- You kiss my ass.
- You kiss my ass.

01:22:04.551 --> 01:22:05.451
- Yeah.
- Stop.

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:06.621
I'm outta here. Shit.

01:22:07.654 --> 01:22:08.689
I don't need you anymore!

01:22:12.292 --> 01:22:13.625
People will understand.

01:22:13.627 --> 01:22:14.529
Come on, let's go.

01:22:28.309 --> 01:22:29.444
Anybody here?

01:22:30.543 --> 01:22:31.613
All right, thanks.

01:23:00.507 --> 01:23:02.743
Um...

01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:09.417
Hey, thanks for coming,
everybody.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.756
Now, I'm sure a lot of you
are wondering...

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:18.290
what this little white boy
is doin' on stage.

01:23:21.362 --> 01:23:23.664
Well, my name's Aaron Davis...

01:23:24.798 --> 01:23:26.434
and Mr. B and Uncle Greg...

01:23:28.502 --> 01:23:31.506
they... saved my life.

01:23:33.306 --> 01:23:34.708
And my brother's too.

01:23:40.514 --> 01:23:41.615
<i>Now I'm gonna dance
for you guys.</i>

01:23:43.384 --> 01:23:45.250
And donate some money.

01:23:46.386 --> 01:23:48.055
Okay? Cool.

01:23:50.858 --> 01:23:51.793
Albee, hit it.

01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:25.824
This ain't no Bryant
Brothers. I want my money back.

01:24:25.826 --> 01:24:28.195
Hey, pal, this is for charity.

01:24:40.707 --> 01:24:41.576
Thank you.

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.711
Sure. That's my son.

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:51.485
- That's his son.
- Son?

01:25:11.438 --> 01:25:12.373
Good job, kid!

01:25:20.413 --> 01:25:21.815
Yeah!

01:25:22.483 --> 01:25:23.585
Yeah, Miles!

- I love you too.

01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:24.431
We want to thank everybody
for coming out.

01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:27.735
Supporting us.

01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:31.538
It's been a long, long time.

01:28:33.039 --> 01:28:33.908
It's good to be back.

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:36.674
Thank you.

01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:55.930
The ball drops
in a few minutes, guys.

01:28:58.998 --> 01:29:01.566
Okay, what about
a four-bed in Flushing, 5400?

01:29:01.568 --> 01:29:02.666
Pah!

01:29:02.668 --> 01:29:03.438
Too much!

01:29:04.104 --> 01:29:05.405
And I don't do Queens.

01:29:07.573 --> 01:29:08.742
Congratulations, kid.

01:29:09.475 --> 01:29:10.344
On...?

01:29:10.877 --> 01:29:11.845
My old move.

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.682
Finally pulled it off.

01:29:43.810 --> 01:29:46.546
Hell of a show, guys.
Hell of a show.

01:29:46.747 --> 01:29:49.013
I brought some people with me.
I hope you don't mind.

01:29:49.015 --> 01:29:50.449
They're friends of Greg's.

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:52.854
Greg. Congratulations.
Great show.

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:01.496
Well, is this a funeral
or an after-party?

01:30:02.195 --> 01:30:03.661
We didn't raise the money.

01:30:03.663 --> 01:30:05.065
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:30:05.865 --> 01:30:07.769
You guys were fabulous.

01:30:08.034 --> 01:30:09.668
My dad would turn in his grave

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:11.172
if I didn't do something
to help you out.

01:30:11.904 --> 01:30:13.039
Who's your dad?

01:30:15.108 --> 01:30:18.112
The man who launched our career.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.417
This is for you.

01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:27.518
It's enough to save the theater
and reopen it to the community.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.456
- You kidding?
- For real?

01:30:29.922 --> 01:30:31.057
Well, there's two conditions.

01:30:32.091 --> 01:30:33.991
- Here we go.
- Hang on a minute, everybody.

01:30:33.993 --> 01:30:35.061
One...

01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:37.164
You have to tell me
about my dad.

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:40.034
He was always on the road
with you and...

01:30:41.201 --> 01:30:42.537
I never got to know him.

01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:45.640
And?

01:30:46.606 --> 01:30:48.443
Two, you gotta let us
help you with the books.

01:30:48.675 --> 01:30:49.210
What do you think?

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:52.913
- We say yes!
- What he said.

01:30:54.814 --> 01:30:56.680
Wait, wait, wait, guys, guys.
Here we go, here we go.

01:30:56.682 --> 01:31:01.253
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:05.891
five, four, three, two, one!

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:08.563
Happy New Year!

01:31:15.068 --> 01:31:17.605
I love you.
I'm so proud of you.

01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:20.707
You were great out there,
really great.

01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:30.281
- Love you, Dad.
- Sorry for bein' a jerk.

01:31:30.283 --> 01:31:31.750
No, it's all right.

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:32.620
It was me too.

01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:39.124
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:31:41.795 --> 01:31:43.498
- Hey.
- You're a natural.

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.998
Come on.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.799
Oh, no more.

01:31:48.801 --> 01:31:50.670
See, look at this, you could've
been up there this whole time.
