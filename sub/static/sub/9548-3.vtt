WEBVTT

00:03.745 --> 00:06.873
And the final number is
44,

00:08.016 --> 00:10.348
making tonight's
Gold Rush numbers,

00:10.418 --> 00:17.051
35, 4, 7, 53, 23
and 44.

00:17.692 --> 00:19.626
This is your Gold Rush girl,
Marissa Kessler,

00:19.694 --> 00:22.322
wishing everyone
a lucky lotto day.

00:24.699 --> 00:26.326
Somebody help me!

00:32.406 --> 00:33.999
Help!

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.605 --> 01:05.367
Help me!

01:16.584 --> 01:18.381
No! No!

01:19.955 --> 01:21.946
No! Don't,
please! Don't!

01:29.664 --> 01:32.189
It's a jungle out there

01:32.267 --> 01:35.259
Disorder and confusion
everywhere

01:36.738 --> 01:38.899
No one seems to care

01:38.974 --> 01:39.998
Well, I do

01:40.075 --> 01:42.976
Hey, who's in charge here?

01:43.044 --> 01:45.171
It's a jungle out there

01:46.881 --> 01:49.281
Poison in the very air
we breathe

01:50.151 --> 01:52.449
You know what's in the water
that you drink?

01:52.520 --> 01:53.509
Well, I do

01:53.588 --> 01:56.853
It's amazing

01:56.925 --> 01:58.358
People think I'm crazy

01:58.426 --> 02:00.087
'cause I worry
all the time

02:00.161 --> 02:03.358
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too

02:03.431 --> 02:04.762
You better pay attention

02:04.833 --> 02:07.768
Or this world
we love so much

02:07.836 --> 02:10.828
might just kill you

02:11.506 --> 02:13.736
I could be wrong now

02:13.808 --> 02:15.571
But I don't think so

02:15.643 --> 02:18.339
'Cause there's
a jungle out there

02:18.413 --> 02:20.347
It's a jungle out there

02:34.896 --> 02:37.091
There's something wrong here.

02:43.171 --> 02:44.798
This is wrong.

02:50.345 --> 02:52.677
This is very wrong.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.645
This is very, very...

02:55.717 --> 02:57.014
Wrong?

02:57.952 --> 03:01.615
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.

03:01.689 --> 03:03.680
He was after her.

03:03.758 --> 03:05.225
He took her purse
and some jewelry.

03:05.293 --> 03:07.727
He wanted us
to think robbery.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.457
She was stabbed six times.

03:09.531 --> 03:11.499
That's right. Two in the neck.
Four in the back.

03:11.566 --> 03:15.627
Or, was stabbed three times.
Look at the pattern.

03:15.703 --> 03:18.968
It's two, two and two.

03:20.108 --> 03:23.271
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.

03:23.678 --> 03:25.043
Yes. That's possible.

03:25.113 --> 03:26.478
Who brings
scissors to a mugging?

03:26.548 --> 03:27.674
Scissors say what?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.717
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.

03:29.784 --> 03:32.480
Plus the mud
on her shoes.

03:32.554 --> 03:34.681
There's a mud puddle
near the exit.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.190
But there's
a light right there.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.226
If she was walking,
she would have seen that.

03:39.294 --> 03:41.159
So, she was running when
she left the building.

03:41.229 --> 03:43.459
Whatever happened
started inside.

03:43.531 --> 03:44.555
There was
some kind of fight.

03:44.632 --> 03:47.795
He grabbed some scissors
and chased her out here.

03:48.803 --> 03:50.293
Find me the
station manager.

03:50.371 --> 03:53.169
I want a list of every employee
that was here last night.

03:53.241 --> 03:54.708
Make that every
employee, period.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.074
Yes, sir.
Any idea on motive?

03:57.979 --> 04:01.142
I guess you could say that there
were 12 million people with a motive.

04:01.216 --> 04:04.549
Myself, included.
This was the lotto girl.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.179
She broke my heart
three times a week.

04:07.689 --> 04:09.156
What is that?

04:09.624 --> 04:10.682
What is what?

04:10.758 --> 04:12.919
On her fingertips.
Is that paint?

04:13.561 --> 04:15.290
Yeah. Looks like it.

04:15.363 --> 04:16.762
Hey, Gabby.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.858
Take a sample from her left fingers.
Okay.

04:19.934 --> 04:21.834
Excuse me. Mr. Monk?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.438
I have a nephew.
He's 10 years old.

04:24.506 --> 04:25.973
He's your
biggest fan.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.305
He... He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spiderman.

04:29.377 --> 04:31.038
Really? Kids.

04:31.112 --> 04:32.443
If I could get
your autograph,

04:32.514 --> 04:33.674
he'd think I'm
some kind of hero.

04:33.748 --> 04:37.206
Sorry. Mr. Monk is working.
Maybe when he's finished.

04:37.285 --> 04:38.479
Oh. Sorry.

04:38.553 --> 04:39.850
Anything else?

04:39.921 --> 04:43.721
Clues, clues. Scanning, scanning.
No, that's it. All done.

04:43.791 --> 04:45.656
You said something
about an autograph?

04:45.727 --> 04:48.025
That would be great.
Thank you so much.

04:53.067 --> 04:55.535
Would you mind...

04:56.538 --> 04:58.301
Would you mind...

04:58.740 --> 05:01.300
Perpendicular.
Put your head down.

05:01.376 --> 05:04.368
Your hair is in the way.
Head down. Head down.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.642
Are you okay?

05:06.714 --> 05:07.806
Oh, she's fine.

05:07.882 --> 05:10.612
She looks mad.
Yeah, that's just her look.

05:12.253 --> 05:13.618
What's that?

05:16.357 --> 05:18.154
"It looks like
her number came up."

05:18.226 --> 05:19.716
It's a zinger.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.686
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up. Get it?

05:22.764 --> 05:24.755
Mmm-hmm.
Do you remember last year,

05:24.832 --> 05:26.993
Sergeant Beecham shoved
that junkie into a lamp post

05:27.068 --> 05:28.365
and he said,
"I'll keep you posted"?

05:28.436 --> 05:29.460
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.595
Yeah, everybody heard about it.

05:30.672 --> 05:33.163
I mean, people were repeating it.
It was famous.

05:33.241 --> 05:36.938
This is even better.
This is a classic.

05:37.011 --> 05:38.569
If you say so.

05:38.646 --> 05:41.479
Yeah, I just need to
pick the right moment.

05:43.084 --> 05:45.314
Captain?
If you're ready to release the body,

05:45.386 --> 05:46.614
I can take her downtown.

05:46.688 --> 05:47.780
Okay.

05:51.593 --> 05:53.151
I still don't get it.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.560
Who would want to
kill the lotto girl?

05:55.630 --> 05:57.154
I guess her number came up.

06:01.469 --> 06:03.130
Hey!
What are you doing?

06:03.204 --> 06:05.434
Hey, what are you doing?
That was my line, man.

06:05.506 --> 06:06.803
What are you
talking about?

06:06.874 --> 06:08.501
I just said the exact same
thing two seconds ago.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.600
Ask the Captain.

06:09.677 --> 06:11.770
Randy, this is a crime scene.
For God's sakes...

06:11.846 --> 06:14.076
No. You heard me. Yeah.
You know what? He must have heard me.

06:14.148 --> 06:17.208
Huh? Yeah, it's okay. Look.
It's written in my notebook.

06:17.285 --> 06:19.446
Right here. See that?

06:19.520 --> 06:21.852
"It looks like
her number came up."

06:22.390 --> 06:23.584
Let's see your notebook.

06:23.658 --> 06:26.024
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.085
Please. Come on.
Can you believe this guy?

06:28.162 --> 06:30.653
You know what?
I'm going to have your badge, Officer...

06:30.732 --> 06:33.496
Come on, Shifty.
Let's walk it off.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.371
Excuse me. I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.736
Here's that list
you wanted.

06:39.807 --> 06:42.401
Oh. Great, great, great.
I'll make sure they get it.

06:42.477 --> 06:43.739
How long did she work here?

06:43.811 --> 06:45.938
Not long.
Just a few weeks.

06:46.014 --> 06:49.450
I still can't believe it.
I... I should have put more lights back here.

06:49.517 --> 06:51.280
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You can't blame yourself.

06:51.352 --> 06:53.786
It was at midnight.
The parking lot was empty.

06:53.855 --> 06:55.379
More lights wouldn't have
made a difference.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.219
Thank you, Officer.
That's very nice of you to say.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.420
Oh, I'm not an officer.
I work with Mr. Monk.

07:00.495 --> 07:02.963
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.625
He's a genius. Right?
And you're his partner.

07:05.700 --> 07:10.763
Partnerlbabysitterlassistant
lbabysitter.

07:11.939 --> 07:14.100
What's your name?
Natalie Teeger.

07:14.175 --> 07:16.939
Miss Teeger, I know this
probably sounds callous,

07:17.011 --> 07:18.569
but have you
ever done any acting?

07:18.646 --> 07:21.080
Me? No.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.674
Well, here's my problem.
We've got another show tomorrow night

07:23.751 --> 07:25.616
and I know it's
terrible timing,

07:25.687 --> 07:27.746
but we need someone
to pick the numbers.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.414
You mean on TV?

07:29.490 --> 07:30.957
I think
you're a natural.

07:31.025 --> 07:32.219
No, I don't think so.

07:32.293 --> 07:34.022
Here you go.

07:34.095 --> 07:36.689
I was just talking to
his nephew on the phone.

07:36.764 --> 07:38.925
He couldn't even believe it was really me.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.025
I felt like
Fats Domino.

07:41.102 --> 07:43.502
Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence.
He's the station manager.

07:43.571 --> 07:44.595
Hi.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.640
He just asked me to
be the new lotto girl.

07:46.708 --> 07:47.766
Oh, only for one night.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.242
We can hold a regular
audition over the weekend.

07:50.311 --> 07:52.074
What do you think?

07:52.146 --> 07:55.445
I don't know.
What do you think?

07:55.516 --> 07:56.642
Oh, I think
it sounds like fun.

07:56.718 --> 07:58.948
I know,
but here's the thing.

07:59.020 --> 08:04.151
Tomorrow is Wednesday. Oh.
We've already made plans.

08:04.225 --> 08:05.556
What plans?

08:06.561 --> 08:08.495
Me making dinner while you vacuum the rug?

08:08.563 --> 08:11.054
Exactly.
And here's the other thing.

08:11.132 --> 08:12.394
If I let you
take a night off,

08:12.467 --> 08:14.298
I have to let everybody take a night off.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.394
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?

08:16.471 --> 08:20.305
It's just me! Mr. Monk,
come on, it's one night!

08:20.375 --> 08:24.243
Well, then,
I guess I'll just have to say no...

08:25.646 --> 08:26.977
...kay.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.709
No-kay.

08:29.450 --> 08:31.782
No-kay.

08:32.587 --> 08:35.215
Which is it?
No or okay?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.518
No-kay. No-kay.

08:38.592 --> 08:39.821
He's trying
to say okay.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.361
That's as close as
he's ever going to get.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.919
No-kay. No-kay.

08:43.998 --> 08:45.090
I'm so excited.

08:45.166 --> 08:46.190
No-kay.

08:46.701 --> 08:47.861
She looks nervous.

08:47.935 --> 08:50.870
I don't care as
long as she's lucky.

08:50.938 --> 08:53.168
Is it too much?
You look great.

08:53.975 --> 08:56.136
Excuse me. New girl, new girl.
You're off your mark.

08:56.210 --> 08:57.302
My mark?

08:57.378 --> 08:59.642
Yeah. The big "X" on the floor.
Look where I'm pointing.

08:59.714 --> 09:01.181
Oh.
90 seconds!

09:01.249 --> 09:03.342
90 seconds? Wait. No, no,
no. I don't have a script.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.079
Excuse me.
I never got a script.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.984
There is no script.
This is the lottery.

09:07.054 --> 09:08.919
For the love of God,
if there was a script, we'd all be rich.

09:08.990 --> 09:10.457
God.
Amateurs.

09:14.295 --> 09:16.525
Captain. Lieutenant.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.121
How is the
investigation going?

09:18.199 --> 09:19.826
Well, we're just getting started.

09:19.901 --> 09:21.766
Spoke to the staff,
the camera crew,

09:21.836 --> 09:24.464
everybody said they left
the building after the show.

09:24.539 --> 09:25.938
They usually do.

09:26.007 --> 09:28.908
Well, somebody was here.
The girl didn't stab herself.

09:28.976 --> 09:32.139
You wanted to know if Marissa
received any fan mail.

09:32.213 --> 09:34.044
Some of them
are pretty dicey.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.811
You know, personal.
I put them on top.

09:36.884 --> 09:38.476
I need quiet, everyone!

09:38.553 --> 09:45.152
New girl! New girl! You're on!
In five, four, three, two.

09:47.028 --> 09:50.020
Good evening, people.

09:50.932 --> 09:54.333
Welcome to the Big Gold Rush Pick Six.

09:54.402 --> 09:57.496
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Are you ready to play?

10:00.107 --> 10:02.632
Then let's play.
The lottery.

10:03.778 --> 10:05.803
And the first number is...

10:07.081 --> 10:08.139
Turn it on.

10:10.384 --> 10:11.408
Turn it on!

10:13.588 --> 10:14.953
Oh, my God!

10:16.557 --> 10:20.357
And the first number
is 25.

10:20.428 --> 10:21.827
My mother's birthday.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.789
The next number.

10:27.268 --> 10:31.898
52.
52 cards in a deck.

10:33.574 --> 10:35.633
The next number is...

10:37.979 --> 10:41.176
Seven.
The seven dwarfs.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.012
The seven dwarfs.

10:46.220 --> 10:49.189
32. 32 teeth.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.690
And,

10:54.829 --> 10:58.265
10.
My boss' absolute favorite number.

10:58.332 --> 10:59.492
Aw, crap.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.899
Apparently, not
everybody's favorite.

11:01.969 --> 11:04.199
And the final number
is 17.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.432
My daughter's age!

11:05.506 --> 11:06.905
Hi, Julie!

11:07.542 --> 11:09.908
Once again, the
Gold Rush numbers are

11:09.977 --> 11:15.142
25, 52, 7,
32, 10, and 17.

11:16.417 --> 11:19.682
So, that's it for now.
Keep playing lotto!

11:20.988 --> 11:22.888
You'll thank me later.

11:25.493 --> 11:29.827
"You'll thank me later"?
That's my line. I say that.

11:30.865 --> 11:32.492
Hurts, doesn't it?

11:32.567 --> 11:34.296
You know,
I might as well flush 20 bucks

11:34.368 --> 11:35.926
down the toilet once a week.

11:37.104 --> 11:39.572
It was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible? Yeah.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.800
You were great.
I don't know what happened.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.399
I just...
I got so nervous.

11:42.476 --> 11:43.909
You were great.

11:43.978 --> 11:46.208
It's like a tax
on the stupid.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.248
Come on, Randy.
We're parked out front.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.681
Great job.

11:50.718 --> 11:53.152
Thank you, Mr. Monk.

11:53.220 --> 11:54.346
It was fun.
Yeah.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.821
I'm glad you did it.

11:55.890 --> 12:01.658
What a fun thing to do only one time and
never try it again or mention it again.

12:01.729 --> 12:03.128
Natalie?
Where are you going?

12:03.197 --> 12:06.030
Mr. Lawrence,
I told you I wasn't an actor. I'm so sorry.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.796
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?

12:08.869 --> 12:11.497
That the phones are
lighting up like crazy?

12:11.572 --> 12:14.473
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did?

12:14.542 --> 12:17.511
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?

12:17.578 --> 12:19.842
So, what do you say?

12:19.914 --> 12:22.007
About what?
About doing it full time.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.243
It's just
three nights a week.

12:23.317 --> 12:26.343
I promise it won't
interfere with your day job.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.615
I mean, I don't know.
You really thought I was good?

12:28.689 --> 12:31.214
I told you when I met you.
You're a natural.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.623
Mr. Monk?

12:34.762 --> 12:37.629
Well, I...
Why don't we think about it?

12:37.698 --> 12:39.256
Okay. I will.

12:41.836 --> 12:44.031
I just did. I want to do it.
Oh, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry.

12:44.105 --> 12:46.505
But I could really use the money
and I think it could be fun.

12:46.574 --> 12:48.940
There you go.
A star is born.

12:50.011 --> 12:52.536
No. Don't worry.
It's not going to change a thing.

12:52.613 --> 12:55.207
My job with you always
comes first. I promise.

12:55.282 --> 12:56.715
Come on.
We've got a million things to do.

12:56.784 --> 12:58.411
Okay.
We've got to talk to the publicity people

12:58.486 --> 12:59.544
and set up
a photo shoot.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.460
Natalie.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.054
I hate that picture!

13:36.123 --> 13:38.819
I like the other one better,
the one on the trolley cars.

13:38.893 --> 13:40.053
What do you think?

13:40.127 --> 13:41.253
I don't know.

13:41.328 --> 13:45.230
Oh, my God. It's so weird seeing
myself on a bus like that.

13:45.299 --> 13:47.824
I mean, I can't believe
it's really me up there.

13:47.902 --> 13:50.370
I can't believe this
is really happening.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.497
I can't believe it,
either.

13:56.644 --> 13:59.841
I hate to bring this up,
but we have work to do.

13:59.914 --> 14:02.576
Remember your predecessor,
Marissa Kessler?

14:02.650 --> 14:04.015
Murder victim?

14:04.085 --> 14:06.212
Multiple stab wounds?
Does that ring a bell?

14:06.287 --> 14:08.380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:08.456 --> 14:11.948
All right. Randy and the Captain
are probably already there.

14:12.927 --> 14:14.326
It should be just
around the corner.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.420
It's number 24.

14:16.497 --> 14:20.058
24. 24. 24.

14:20.134 --> 14:22.625
Are you done?
Sorry. Let's do this.

14:23.704 --> 14:24.898
What's the guy's name again?

14:24.972 --> 14:26.906
What... Who was it?
Her ex-boyfriend?

14:26.974 --> 14:30.171
No!
No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.041
He checked out.
Oh, God.

14:32.113 --> 14:34.479
That's right.
You weren't at the meeting this morning.

14:34.548 --> 14:36.175
But I had to
shop for a dress.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.115
I can't wear the same thing every show.

14:38.185 --> 14:41.484
I had to wear the same blouse
three times last week. Three.

14:41.555 --> 14:44.991
Three. Three. Tres.

14:45.059 --> 14:46.151
Three.
Hello.

14:46.227 --> 14:48.320
Sorry. Just remind me.

14:48.395 --> 14:50.556
All right.
His name is Malcolm O'Dwyer.

14:50.631 --> 14:53.156
He's some kind
of lottery fanatic.

14:53.234 --> 14:56.829
He wrote a bunch of fan letters
to Marissa before she was killed.

14:56.904 --> 14:59.099
Hey! I'm a big fan!

14:59.607 --> 15:02.633
Thank you very much.
Not you. The lotto girl.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.473
"You'll thank me later!"

15:06.313 --> 15:10.477
That's not actually my line!
Mr. Monk said it first!

15:10.551 --> 15:12.712
I thought that was you.
It's you, right?

15:12.787 --> 15:14.778
Yeah. I guess it is.
Yeah.

15:14.855 --> 15:17.551
Natalie Teeger.
Oh, my God.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.149
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?

15:19.226 --> 15:21.592
We really do have to...
Oh, sure.

15:21.662 --> 15:23.323
We should head up.

15:23.397 --> 15:25.592
Mr. Monk, do you mind?
The Captain probably...

15:25.666 --> 15:29.500
Mr. Monk? Bend.
Bend a little.

15:29.570 --> 15:32.266
Bend, please. Bend.

15:34.241 --> 15:35.731
I never know what to say.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.505
I know what to say.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.173
Did I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.

15:40.247 --> 15:42.681
My name is on them.
I'm not going to deny that.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.718
Did you bother reading them?
Yes, sir, I have.

15:44.785 --> 15:46.753
Well, then,
you know I didn't threaten anybody.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.652
I offered the producers and
the lottery commissioners

15:48.722 --> 15:50.849
some constructive
criticism.

15:50.925 --> 15:51.983
I don't know why
they don't listen to me.

15:52.059 --> 15:54.493
I know more about this lottery
system than any living American.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.393
I'm sure you do,
Mr. O'Dwyer.

15:56.463 --> 15:59.125
It's not just a game.
Not to me.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.824
I can see that.

16:00.901 --> 16:02.596
Where were you a week ago,
Monday, sir?

16:02.670 --> 16:06.003
A week ago, Monday.
That would be 4, 7,

16:06.073 --> 16:09.440
23, 35, 44, 53.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.534
Uh, excuse me?

16:10.611 --> 16:12.772
I was here.
Like always.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.077
Watching a drawing.

16:16.717 --> 16:18.548
Three prime numbers!

16:19.587 --> 16:21.782
I did not see
that one coming.

16:23.057 --> 16:24.854
Do you own a pair of
scissors, Mr. O'Dwyer?

16:24.925 --> 16:26.017
Of course I do.
Who doesn't?

16:26.093 --> 16:28.357
May
I see them, please?

16:40.341 --> 16:42.332
How about some
metallic paint?

16:42.409 --> 16:43.603
Paint?

16:44.245 --> 16:46.805
Yeah, a shade called
titanium black.

16:47.414 --> 16:49.814
Do you think I killed Marissa Kessler?

16:49.884 --> 16:52.284
Well, you do have her
picture up all over the wall.

16:52.353 --> 16:54.446
I've got everybody's
picture up on the wall.

16:54.521 --> 16:56.887
I mean,
these are the past lotto girls.

16:56.957 --> 16:59.323
Jackpot winners.
People who work there.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.827
Secretaries. Gaffers.
They all know me.

17:01.896 --> 17:06.356
I'm a freelance journalist.
I publish a newsletter. A lotto bulletin.

17:07.701 --> 17:11.102
Yeah, I've seen that.
What's this?

17:11.171 --> 17:12.900
These are some numbers
I'm thinking of playing.

17:12.973 --> 17:14.372
Oh, no, no.
Malcolm, don't worry.

17:14.441 --> 17:16.102
Nobody's going to
steal your numbers.

17:16.175 --> 17:17.803
Well,
you'd be a fool not to.

17:17.877 --> 17:19.903
These six numbers aren't
just chosen at random.

17:19.980 --> 17:23.211
They're my own algorithm based on
probability, emerging number patterns

17:23.284 --> 17:25.444
and the theories
of Sir Isaac Newton.

17:25.519 --> 17:26.986
Isaac Newton?

17:27.755 --> 17:29.382
Really?
There's just six numbers.

17:29.490 --> 17:31.117
You only buy
one ticket a week?

17:31.191 --> 17:34.058
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?

17:36.130 --> 17:39.031
Well, it depends. 20.

17:41.368 --> 17:43.199
You're just shotgunning it, huh?

17:43.337 --> 17:44.668
Rookie move.

17:44.738 --> 17:46.501
Well, how much have you won?

17:46.573 --> 17:48.404
How much ever or
how much this year?

17:48.475 --> 17:50.238
Let's say ever.

17:50.311 --> 17:53.280
Zero. It's not just
about winning or losing.

17:53.347 --> 17:55.315
It's the lottery.

17:55.382 --> 17:57.179
It's all about winning.
What else is there?

17:57.251 --> 17:59.219
The journey, Captain!

17:59.920 --> 18:01.854
It's how you get there.

18:02.690 --> 18:07.821
I'd rather lose my way than win
a $20 million jackpot your way.

18:10.764 --> 18:14.063
Okay.
I think we're through here.

18:17.538 --> 18:20.701
You think you're pretty clever,
don't you, Mr. Lottery Expert?

18:20.774 --> 18:22.901
Well, I've got news for you.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.877
We've got your number.

18:37.191 --> 18:39.523
Hey.
Mother of mercy.

18:39.593 --> 18:40.855
Yeah,
we were just leaving.

18:40.928 --> 18:43.488
I don't blame you.
Who is this guy?

18:43.564 --> 18:46.931
A very colorful dead end.
Hey, where's Natalie?

18:48.535 --> 18:51.504
She's downstairs.
Oh, she's signing autographs.

18:51.572 --> 18:52.903
You hate this,
don't you?

18:52.973 --> 18:54.565
What?
Natalie getting all the attention.

18:54.641 --> 18:57.235
No. I'm happy for her.
Sure you are.

18:57.311 --> 19:00.246
It's good for her.
She deserves it. Long overdue.

19:00.314 --> 19:03.044
It's driving you
crazy. I can tell.

19:03.117 --> 19:06.018
You used to be the superstar.
Now, you're Garfunkel.

19:06.086 --> 19:08.281
I'm not Garfunkel.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.823
You're Garfunkel
and you can't stand it.

19:10.891 --> 19:12.552
I'm not Garfunkel.

19:17.898 --> 19:19.559
I'm not Garfunkel.

19:22.469 --> 19:24.266
Congratulations
to all you winners.

19:24.338 --> 19:28.297
We'll see you Monday night for the
biggest super jackpot in lotto history.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.435
$212 million.

19:31.512 --> 19:34.675
I'm Natalie Teeger reminding
everybody to try your luck.

19:34.748 --> 19:36.613
You'll thank me later.

19:37.584 --> 19:39.279
Bye-bye.

19:39.353 --> 19:41.378
And we're out.
Eddie, you did it again.

19:41.455 --> 19:43.719
Please don't cue the music
until I'm waving goodbye.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.259
Sorry.
It's not rocket science.

19:46.326 --> 19:47.918
Stan, there you are.
Did you get my email?

19:47.995 --> 19:49.587
About?
My new idea.

19:49.663 --> 19:51.187
About all the fan letters I've been getting.

19:51.265 --> 19:52.823
I thought I could read
a few of them on the air.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.492
Well, I don't really think we have time.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.592
Oh, sure,
we have time.

19:55.669 --> 19:57.102
I'll just pick the
lotto numbers faster.

19:57.171 --> 19:59.435
Well, you see, Natalie,
the show is about the numbers.

19:59.506 --> 20:02.339
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.570
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?

20:04.645 --> 20:07.239
Because that's not
what I'm hearing.

20:07.314 --> 20:09.509
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you Monday.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.709
Okay.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.514
Jesus.

20:15.055 --> 20:17.615
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?

20:17.691 --> 20:19.625
Yes, they do. Because
they carry your voice

20:19.693 --> 20:21.183
from this microphone to that sound board.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.729
Well, can't you put them someplace else?
I almost broke my neck.

20:23.797 --> 20:25.458
Almost doesn't count.

20:25.532 --> 20:27.693
Fine. I'll do it.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.259
Okay. What are doing?
Are you mental?

20:30.337 --> 20:32.703
Put it down. Put it down.
Let go.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.831
Put it down.
I am taking care of it.

20:33.907 --> 20:35.534
I got it. Put it down.
I got it.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.906
Billy, what the hell are you doing?

20:36.977 --> 20:38.137
Stan, I can't work with this guy.

20:38.212 --> 20:40.237
What, you can't work with me?

20:40.314 --> 20:42.748
Who do you think you are, lady?
I've been here for eight years.

20:42.816 --> 20:44.909
And you're just another
untalented pretty face.

20:44.985 --> 20:46.714
Billy, calm down.
Untalented, huh?

20:46.787 --> 20:49.347
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?

20:49.423 --> 20:51.448
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up.

20:51.525 --> 20:53.390
That has nothing to do with you,
you moron.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.451
Billy! I've warned you
before about your attitude.

20:55.529 --> 20:56.928
That's it.
You're out of here.

20:56.997 --> 20:59.158
You're fired.
Somebody call security!

20:59.233 --> 21:02.225
What? No, no, no, no. Fired?
Wait, no. Don't fire him.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.361
Look. See? I'm moving it.
I'm moving the cable. I'm moving...

21:04.438 --> 21:06.429
Get him out of here. Stan.
Stan, don't do this, please.

21:06.507 --> 21:07.974
Not now. Okay? Come on.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.066
It's too late, Billy.
I'm sorry. I'm apologizing.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.372
Mr. Logan
has been terminated.

21:11.445 --> 21:12.469
I don't want him
back in the building.

21:12.546 --> 21:14.377
You make sure you get his
security pass and keys.

21:14.448 --> 21:15.779
Get him out of here!

21:15.849 --> 21:18.784
Stan. Listen to me. It was my fault, too.
I tripped over the cable. I...

21:18.852 --> 21:20.342
Natalie,
this is not about you.

21:20.420 --> 21:22.445
I've been warning
this guy all summer.

21:22.523 --> 21:24.514
Come on, people!
Let's get that stage reset.

21:24.591 --> 21:27.458
Make it look good.
Big, big jackpot on Monday.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.592
Garfunkel?

21:34.668 --> 21:36.795
Yeah, I'm probably the biggest
Garfunkel who ever lived.

21:36.870 --> 21:39.134
I mean, after all
I've done for her.

21:39.206 --> 21:42.835
You know,
I give her money almost every week.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.071
But doesn't
she work for you?

21:45.779 --> 21:48.680
That's not the
point, exactly.

21:49.183 --> 21:52.152
Adrian, Natalie
is a human being.

21:52.753 --> 21:55.551
Now, all this attention can
throw a person off balance.

21:55.622 --> 21:58.318
Especially if it comes
suddenly and unexpectedly.

21:58.392 --> 22:00.690
You know, I once wrote
a book on body language

22:00.761 --> 22:04.822
and it spent all of three
minutes on the best-seller list.

22:04.898 --> 22:08.459
Now, I was very young and I'm sorry
to say I became a bit of a diva.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.729
I didn't like
myself very much.

22:09.803 --> 22:11.737
So, now,
you're on her side.

22:11.805 --> 22:14.296
The question is,
why aren't you on her side?

22:14.374 --> 22:16.274
Why aren't you
happy for her?

22:16.343 --> 22:18.208
Natalie is
your friend.

22:18.278 --> 22:20.940
Maybe you're afraid she
doesn't need you anymore.

22:21.014 --> 22:22.413
Maybe you're afraid
of losing her.

22:22.482 --> 22:24.916
Or maybe
I just feel insulted.

22:24.985 --> 22:26.009
Insulted?

22:26.086 --> 22:28.646
What I do is hard.
I am out there.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.020
I am sweating out
every clue.

22:31.091 --> 22:32.991
I am putting killers
behind bars.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.188
What does she do?
What does she do?

22:37.831 --> 22:44.236
91. Number 91.
91. Number 91.

22:44.304 --> 22:48.400
91. Number...
I mean, how hard is that?

22:48.475 --> 22:50.375
I mean,
a talking monkey could do her job.

22:50.444 --> 22:51.672
It's embarrassing.

22:51.745 --> 22:55.511
Actually, that's 16.
See, you're holding it upside-down.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.310
Oh, it's...
It's confusing.

22:59.386 --> 23:01.286
There's usually a little line under the nine.

23:01.355 --> 23:03.653
It goes under the six.
The line goes under the six.

23:03.724 --> 23:04.782
I'm pretty sure it's
the nine.

23:04.858 --> 23:07.053
It's no big deal. Look,
I've seen it my whole life.

23:07.127 --> 23:09.027
I've never seen
it under the six.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.155
Why don't we ask Natalie,
then? Well, she's the expert.

23:11.231 --> 23:13.096
Okay. Okay.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.728
But I see your point.
About the monkey.

23:16.803 --> 23:21.069
All I'm trying to say is
it's not the same Natalie.

23:21.141 --> 23:23.132
If you knew her,
you wouldn't know her.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.974
Last night, after the show,
she got somebody fired.

23:26.046 --> 23:28.310
Really?
One of the crew. Sound guy.

23:28.382 --> 23:31.044
There were some wires
on the floor. She was...

23:33.687 --> 23:35.052
You know, complaining.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.215
And, I mean,
I met the guy when I was there.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.088
He was a nice kid.

23:39.159 --> 23:41.252
Now,
what's he going to do?

23:41.328 --> 23:43.387
What's he going to do?

23:43.463 --> 23:44.623
And...

23:54.074 --> 23:56.406
Wait. Don't tell me.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.068
Sound engineer
Billy Logan, right?

23:58.145 --> 23:59.305
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

23:59.379 --> 24:01.472
Oh, my God. Come in,
come in, come in, come in!

24:01.548 --> 24:03.778
Oh, I can't
believe this. Here.

24:15.962 --> 24:17.827
You've been
taking pictures of me.

24:17.898 --> 24:19.559
Yeah,
I thought I saw you.

24:19.633 --> 24:21.362
I hope
you don't mind.

24:21.435 --> 24:25.394
There was nothing on the website, so,
I took a few candids.

24:26.373 --> 24:27.897
They're for the next issue.

24:27.974 --> 24:31.375
Cast and crew, after hours,
behind the scenes.

24:32.245 --> 24:37.376
While I have you here,
I have a couple of questions.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.058
It's not your lucky day.

24:54.468 --> 24:56.868
What a shame. Just a kid.

24:57.504 --> 25:00.598
At least he didn't hit
anybody when he jumped.

25:00.674 --> 25:02.665
Are we sure he jumped?

25:05.212 --> 25:09.148
"Tired of losing."
Not much of a note.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.047
Brevity,
the soul of wit.

25:11.118 --> 25:14.281
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.

25:15.822 --> 25:18.950
No. There's something
weird about this.

25:19.025 --> 25:20.822
Monk, look around you.

25:20.894 --> 25:24.022
That note's probably the least
weird thing in the whole apartment.

25:24.097 --> 25:25.997
This is the birthplace of weird.

25:26.066 --> 25:29.001
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.970
Isn't tomorrow night
the big jackpot?

25:32.038 --> 25:35.599
Yeah.
Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win,

25:35.675 --> 25:38.542
which makes him a whole lot smarter than me.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.549
What have you got?

25:44.618 --> 25:46.449
A contact lens case.

25:48.855 --> 25:50.982
With only one lens.

25:52.993 --> 25:56.690
Fluid! It's fluid!
I need a wipe.

25:57.731 --> 25:59.722
What?
I don't have a wipe.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.033
Give... Give me a wipe.
Just... I need a wipe.

26:04.704 --> 26:06.296
Where's Natalie?

26:06.373 --> 26:08.739
I'm your biggest fan.
I never miss a show.

26:08.809 --> 26:10.800
Oh, thank you.
That means a lot.

26:10.877 --> 26:12.572
Natalie, what's
your favorite number?

26:12.646 --> 26:14.307
My gosh.
There are so many.

26:14.381 --> 26:16.144
Mine's 19.
That's a good one.

26:16.216 --> 26:17.581
Do you think it's going to
come up on the show tomorrow?

26:17.651 --> 26:22.213
Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.
I got a little distracted.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.757
Is the cadaver in
your way? We could...

26:24.825 --> 26:26.486
We could move it across
the street if you like.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.858
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

26:28.929 --> 26:30.362
So,
how did it go upstairs?

26:30.430 --> 26:31.590
Fine.

26:31.665 --> 26:33.633
Is that
your boyfriend?

26:33.700 --> 26:36.032
Oh, no,
this is my boss.

26:36.102 --> 26:39.299
This is Adrian Monk, who
is a hugely famous detective.

26:39.372 --> 26:41.431
He solves...
Natalie, who does your hair?

26:41.508 --> 26:45.376
Oh, God.
Well, you take your time. Okay?

26:45.445 --> 26:50.178
I'll just be over here at the crime scene,
if anybody's interested.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.115
Natalie?
My mom's in the hospital,

26:52.185 --> 26:55.279
and it would mean so much to her if
you would take a picture with me.

26:55.355 --> 26:56.913
Please?
- Okay.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.184
Thanks.

26:59.860 --> 27:01.191
Murder!

27:02.829 --> 27:04.820
Or suicide.

27:05.732 --> 27:07.097
Or murder.

27:07.901 --> 27:11.337
It's a tough call. Yeah.
This is a tough one.

27:13.740 --> 27:17.767
In many ways,
this reminds me of the killer astronaut case

27:17.844 --> 27:20.608
I solved last year.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.739
You probably
read about it.

27:23.817 --> 27:26.251
Hey, Monk?
Look at this.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.678
Hello.

27:29.756 --> 27:31.553
It's the other lens.

27:33.927 --> 27:35.724
It looks like
you were right.

27:36.263 --> 27:40.063
Nobody jumps after putting
in one contact lens.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.294
Want me to put it
in this evidence bag?

27:44.004 --> 27:46.336
Bag number 32.

27:46.873 --> 27:53.210
Hey. 32. 32. 3-2.

27:53.847 --> 27:56.111
32.

27:56.182 --> 27:59.049
Mr. Monk, are you mocking me?
In public?

27:59.119 --> 28:00.143
I don't make
fun of your job.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.983
That's because
I have a real job.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.955
I'm solving
a homicide here.

28:04.024 --> 28:05.184
Well, I have a real job,
too.

28:05.258 --> 28:07.522
I'm changing people's lives.
I'm making them rich.

28:07.594 --> 28:10.961
Yeah. You are not
making them rich.

28:11.598 --> 28:14.260
You're not giving them financial advice.

28:14.334 --> 28:15.858
You're just reading little numbers

28:15.936 --> 28:17.836
off little
white ping-pong balls.

28:17.904 --> 28:22.000
And if it wasn't you,
they'd just hire some other bim...

28:22.075 --> 28:24.441
Some other what? Bim what?

28:27.447 --> 28:28.436
Bimportant person.

28:28.515 --> 28:30.915
Mr. Monk, do you
think I'm a bimbo?

28:30.984 --> 28:33.953
Look, I know what I do isn't the
most bimportant job on the earth,

28:34.020 --> 28:35.385
but what do I do for you?

28:35.455 --> 28:38.754
Hand you wipes all day long?
Pick up your laundry?

28:38.825 --> 28:40.315
You know,
people admire me now.

28:40.393 --> 28:42.418
And I admit it.
I am enjoying the attention.

28:42.495 --> 28:43.553
I guess I needed it.

28:43.630 --> 28:47.532
Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.
But I can't work like this.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.703
So, you're going
to have to choose.

29:01.748 --> 29:03.272
All right.
Then I guess I quit.

29:03.350 --> 29:04.817
Thank God.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.912
Well,
call the station manager,

29:07.988 --> 29:09.080
and tell him
to find somebody else.

29:09.155 --> 29:10.622
No, I quit you.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.490
I quit us.

29:28.375 --> 29:32.869
Monk, stop crying. I don't know where she is.
It's going to be okay.

29:34.347 --> 29:37.612
No. No, I can't, Monk.
I'm at the gym.

29:39.119 --> 29:40.643
No, you don't want
to come down here.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.314
Believe me.
There are naked people here.

29:44.791 --> 29:47.055
Look. I tell you what.
I've got to work late tonight.

29:47.127 --> 29:49.459
Why don't you
come by the office?

29:49.863 --> 29:51.831
Good. Okay.
See you then.

30:22.262 --> 30:24.856
Hello, everybody.
I'm Natalie Teeger.

30:24.931 --> 30:27.331
Who's ready to
make lotto history?

30:27.400 --> 30:32.633
Our super jackpot
is worth $212 million.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.139
Why did I
make her choose?

30:34.207 --> 30:36.835
Of course she'd choose to leave.
Everybody leaves.

30:36.910 --> 30:38.036
First, my father.

30:38.111 --> 30:40.136
Monk, don't do this now.
- Then, Trudy.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.771
Trudy didn't leave you.
Sharona.

30:41.848 --> 30:43.816
Now, Dr. Kroger...

30:43.883 --> 30:45.510
I can't blame
Natalie for leaving.

30:45.585 --> 30:47.314
I'd leave me, too,
if I had the chance.

30:47.387 --> 30:52.916
God, I am the king of Garfunkel.
I am oozing Garfunkel.

30:52.992 --> 30:55.517
She'll be back, Monk.
She just needs time to cool off.

30:55.595 --> 30:56.653
That's right.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.130
She probably feels
worse than you do.

30:59.199 --> 31:01.292
She looks
pretty happy to me.

31:01.367 --> 31:02.664
Oh, would you
just turn it off?

31:02.736 --> 31:04.761
Please. It's just...
It's too painful.

31:04.838 --> 31:07.466
No, no. Wait.
Did she just say 15?

31:09.509 --> 31:11.602
I've got
four numbers here.

31:11.678 --> 31:14.340
Our next
number is 33. 3-3.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.847
So nice,
they named it twice.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.143
Oh.
- My God.

31:17.217 --> 31:20.015
God, I can't stand it anymore.
All right...

31:21.287 --> 31:26.554
And our final number
for $212 million is...

31:28.661 --> 31:30.026
54.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.461
54.

31:31.965 --> 31:33.330
54.

31:34.701 --> 31:36.430
54!

31:38.004 --> 31:41.201
Making tonight's final Gold
Rush numbers... 25, 62...

31:41.274 --> 31:43.139
...25, 62, 12...
...12...

31:43.209 --> 31:46.372
...15, 33, and 54.
...15, 33...

31:47.113 --> 31:48.478
...54.

31:52.952 --> 31:55.182
Oh, my dear Lord!

31:55.255 --> 31:56.813
All day,
I had this feeling!

31:56.890 --> 31:59.120
Congratulations.

31:59.192 --> 32:00.750
Are you going to quit?

32:00.827 --> 32:03.125
What? You kidding?
I quit 30 seconds ago

32:03.196 --> 32:05.892
when the 54 ball popped out of the drum.

32:09.569 --> 32:13.699
Come here! You big, beautiful,
no-longer-hypothetical boat!

32:18.178 --> 32:20.840
Randy?
Do you still have those student loans?

32:20.914 --> 32:22.438
Yeah, I've got
eight more years.

32:22.515 --> 32:24.244
Not anymore!
No way!

32:24.784 --> 32:25.944
No way! I love you!

32:26.019 --> 32:27.611
Yes! Oh, thank you!

32:27.687 --> 32:29.985
Oh, thank you! Wait, wait!
Believe it. Wait, wait.

32:30.056 --> 32:32.115
- Two hundred what?
- 212.

32:32.192 --> 32:34.888
Two hundred and twelve?
$212 million!

32:36.029 --> 32:37.360
I gotta call my kids.

32:37.430 --> 32:38.829
I've got to find
a good accountant.

32:38.898 --> 32:40.661
Hey! I can buy
a good accountant.

32:40.733 --> 32:44.225
I can buy 20 good accountants!
I hit the jackpot!

32:44.304 --> 32:45.771
Captain just
won the lottery!

32:45.839 --> 32:47.306
Hey. Next time
you call me Captain,

32:47.373 --> 32:49.967
it's because you're on my boat!
Yes!

32:52.512 --> 32:54.844
Oh, my goodness!
I'm a rich man.

32:54.914 --> 32:57.178
Everybody leaves.
- Look at this.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.067
Natalie.

33:25.144 --> 33:27.977
Mr. Monk, I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.948
What happened?
Are you okay?

33:31.551 --> 33:32.609
You haven't heard?

33:32.685 --> 33:33.913
What?

33:33.987 --> 33:35.477
What time is it?

33:35.555 --> 33:37.250
5:00. One minute after.

33:37.323 --> 33:39.223
Turn on the news.

33:39.292 --> 33:40.919
What... What channel?

33:40.994 --> 33:42.018
Any channel.

33:42.095 --> 33:44.996
A major scandal involving
the Gold Rush lottery.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.055
As we told you this morning,
there were two winners

33:47.133 --> 33:49.260
in last night's
jackpot giveaway.

33:49.335 --> 33:52.395
Eugene Maddox,
a truck driver from Rockaway Township

33:52.472 --> 33:57.136
and Leland Stottlemeyer, a highly decorated
officer with the San Francisco police.

33:57.210 --> 33:59.007
Now, according to the
rules, these two men

33:59.078 --> 34:02.479
would split the
$212 million grand prize.

34:02.548 --> 34:03.810
Mr. Maddox, what do
you do for a living?

34:03.883 --> 34:05.874
Yesterday,
I was unemployed.

34:05.952 --> 34:07.943
Today, I guess I'm retired.

34:08.021 --> 34:09.248
That makes two
of us, brother.

34:09.322 --> 34:11.516
But in a stunning development this morning,

34:11.591 --> 34:15.527
the lottery commissioner suspended
all payment to Captain Stottlemeyer

34:15.594 --> 34:20.396
after it was revealed that Stottlemeyer
has known and worked with Natalie Teeger,

34:20.466 --> 34:22.627
the newly hired
lotto ball girl.

34:22.702 --> 34:24.862
There is
a news conference...

34:24.938 --> 34:26.235
He said we cheated.

34:26.306 --> 34:28.399
Why?
Just because you know the Captain?

34:28.474 --> 34:31.705
I... I mean... Okay. It looks bad,
but it's not impossible.

34:31.777 --> 34:34.440
No. It's not just that.
They said they have proof.

34:34.514 --> 34:38.348
They checked the equipment.
There was something wrong with the machine.

34:38.418 --> 34:39.817
It was rigged.

34:39.886 --> 34:41.080
Rigged?

34:41.688 --> 34:43.815
They said I'm going to jail.

34:44.357 --> 34:47.382
Mr. Monk, I'm sorry I said I quit.
I'm sorry.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.518
Okay. Okay.

34:49.594 --> 34:51.358
You have to help me.

34:51.431 --> 34:52.591
Yeah.

35:04.110 --> 35:07.568
Good morning,
Miss Teeger, Captain.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.047
You and your friend, Mr. Monk,
wanted to see what evidence we had?

35:10.116 --> 35:11.140
Yeah.

35:11.217 --> 35:12.241
Well, here it is.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.980
Before we begin,
is there anything you want to say

35:15.054 --> 35:16.954
to the lottery commissioner?

35:17.023 --> 35:20.424
Yep. I'm not a cheater.
Neither is Natalie.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.687
That's all I have to say.

35:21.761 --> 35:25.060
Well, I'm afraid we can prove otherwise,
Captain Stottlemeyer.

35:25.131 --> 35:27.429
After the drawing,
we received a phone call.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.626
An anonymous tip.

35:28.701 --> 35:30.168
I asked Mr. Lawrence to check it out.

35:30.236 --> 35:32.033
I reviewed the tape from Monday night's show.

35:32.105 --> 35:33.800
I didn't see
anything suspicious,

35:33.873 --> 35:36.205
so we examined
the machine itself.

35:36.275 --> 35:39.335
We examined the balls.
We measured them, we weighed them.

35:39.412 --> 35:43.576
We were bouncing them.
And everything seemed perfectly normal.

35:43.649 --> 35:44.741
So, what's the problem?

35:44.817 --> 35:46.842
This is the problem.

36:17.984 --> 36:20.009
The same numbers?
The same numbers.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.152
But that's not possible.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.485
That's what we thought.
So we tried again.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.047
And again.
And again.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.616
And the same six numbers kept popping up.

36:28.694 --> 36:32.061
Not always in the same order,
but the very same numbers.

36:32.131 --> 36:34.156
How did that happen?

36:37.070 --> 36:39.163
They're very
lucky numbers?

36:39.405 --> 36:40.929
Metallic paint.

36:41.874 --> 36:43.637
Very good, Mr. Monk.

36:44.143 --> 36:45.838
We took
a closer look.

36:45.912 --> 36:50.076
The numbers on these six
balls and only these six balls

36:50.149 --> 36:52.549
were painted with
metal-based paint.

36:52.618 --> 36:54.449
All the others
were acrylic based.

36:54.520 --> 36:57.045
There's a magnet
in the microphone.

36:57.123 --> 36:58.522
Right again,
Mr. Monk.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.991
An electromagnet.
Battery operated.

37:01.060 --> 37:03.426
Strong enough to pull these six balls

37:03.496 --> 37:05.327
and only these balls up the chute.

37:05.398 --> 37:07.628
Well, we didn't put that there.

37:07.700 --> 37:11.500
Oh, Miss Teeger, please.
Don't insult us.

37:11.571 --> 37:13.004
You started working
here two weeks ago.

37:13.072 --> 37:15.063
You had access
to the equipment.

37:15.141 --> 37:18.702
Suddenly, your friend
wins what? $106 million.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.338
I suggest you
both get good lawyers.

37:21.414 --> 37:22.711
What?

37:24.283 --> 37:28.777
This is nuts. Hey, Monk?
Monk? Have you got anything?

37:31.724 --> 37:33.555
There were two winners.
What happened to the other man?

37:33.626 --> 37:34.650
The truck driver?

37:34.727 --> 37:37.924
Eugene Maddox.
We've already talked to his lawyers.

37:37.997 --> 37:42.093
He's agreed not to sue us in exchange
for a rather generous settlement.

37:44.904 --> 37:46.496
I'm sure he did.

37:48.107 --> 37:49.574
Waiter! Yo!

37:49.642 --> 37:52.236
There's something
wrong with my glass.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.074
It's empty.

37:54.147 --> 37:56.445
You know what? Hell. Just bring the
whole bottle and charge it to the room.

37:56.516 --> 37:59.349
I'm afraid you can't afford it, Billy.

37:59.418 --> 38:03.354
You think you guys won the jackpot?
We've got news for you, Billy.

38:03.422 --> 38:04.855
We've got your numbers.

38:04.924 --> 38:06.653
Number, number.
We've got your number.

38:06.726 --> 38:07.818
Numbers?

38:07.894 --> 38:10.488
Will you girls excuse us
for a minute?

38:13.499 --> 38:14.761
Thank you.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.529
So, you guys
are old friends?

38:16.602 --> 38:19.400
No. No.
We just met at the bar.

38:19.472 --> 38:20.962
Yeah.
I recognized him from TV.

38:21.040 --> 38:23.167
I went over and said hello.
What was your name again?

38:23.242 --> 38:24.766
Billy, don't bother.
We've already checked.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.209
You guys have known each other for years.

38:26.279 --> 38:28.042
You've worked on
five movies together.

38:28.114 --> 38:30.412
I knew I'd seen this
logo somewhere before.

38:31.717 --> 38:34.743
At the press conference,
it was on your friend's jacket.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.618
That's the clue
that capped the case.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.555
That's not even
a real phrase.

38:39.625 --> 38:40.853
It's all over, Billy.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.895
We know why you killed Marissa Kessler.

38:42.962 --> 38:46.830
The paint we found on her
fingertips told the whole story.

38:47.533 --> 38:52.095
That night after the show, she must
have caught you rigging the equipment.

38:54.273 --> 38:56.070
It looks like you painted
yourself into a corner.

38:56.142 --> 38:57.336
Randy.

38:58.244 --> 39:01.145
You think I rigged
the super jackpot?

39:01.214 --> 39:02.681
That's right.

39:02.748 --> 39:04.978
It's... It... Okay.
If I rigged the lottery...

39:05.051 --> 39:06.484
lf... lf...
If I'm so smart,

39:06.552 --> 39:09.851
why would I let this
hammerhead win half the money?

39:09.922 --> 39:13.414
Well, you didn't want to.
You didn't plan on it. But you got fired.

39:13.492 --> 39:14.584
Well, because of her.

39:14.660 --> 39:15.820
Hey, there were
cables on the floor.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.157
Somebody could
have gotten killed.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.425
They were duct taped down.
Nobody was tripping on it.

39:19.498 --> 39:21.466
Okay. Okay.
I told you about her.

39:21.534 --> 39:23.661
Can we focus here?

39:23.736 --> 39:25.601
Your plan was
already in motion.

39:25.671 --> 39:27.536
You'd put the gizmo in the microphone,

39:27.607 --> 39:29.404
but getting fired
ruined everything.

39:29.475 --> 39:31.409
They escorted you
out of the studio.

39:31.477 --> 39:34.969
They took your security pass
and you couldn't get back in.

39:35.047 --> 39:36.981
You had a problem, Billy.
A real dilemma.

39:37.049 --> 39:38.073
Is that right?

39:38.150 --> 39:40.618
Yeah. You knew the six numbers
that were going to hit.

39:40.686 --> 39:43.746
But then what?
You were locked out of the building.

39:43.823 --> 39:46.223
You couldn't just
turn the magnet off.

39:46.292 --> 39:49.090
You knew the same numbers were going
to keep coming up night after night.

39:49.161 --> 39:52.460
After four or five times,
somebody would have noticed.

39:52.531 --> 39:55.295
Yep. They'd find the magnet,
you'd be the first and only suspect,

39:55.368 --> 39:57.097
so you framed us.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.837
Do you have any idea
what you did to this man?

39:59.905 --> 40:02.772
This man has nothing.

40:02.842 --> 40:05.402
His... His wife left him.
His girlfriend is in jail.

40:05.478 --> 40:07.878
And he's been living
in a ratty little condo.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.108
Thank you, Randy.
He's been looking at a sad little picture

40:10.182 --> 40:12.207
of a boat on a wall
for 11 years...

40:12.285 --> 40:13.309
Randy.
...and you gave him hope,

40:13.386 --> 40:14.614
and then,
you ripped his heart out.

40:14.687 --> 40:15.847
Randy.

40:16.355 --> 40:17.947
For that,
you're going to burn in hell.

40:18.024 --> 40:19.252
That and the homicide.

40:19.325 --> 40:20.519
Actually, two homicides.

40:20.593 --> 40:24.654
Don't forget the lottery fanatic who
had a picture of them both together.

40:25.598 --> 40:27.395
I think
we're done here.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.866
You two are under
arrest. Stand up.

40:30.536 --> 40:33.334
Let me see your hands, hotshot.
Thank you.

40:33.406 --> 40:34.771
Glad you like
numbers, Billy.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.774
You're going to be wearing
some numbers on your shirt.

40:36.842 --> 40:38.969
Is that right?
They won't be lottery numbers.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.740
I get it.
Because you're going to prison.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.145
Yeah, I get it.
You have the right to remain silent.

40:43.215 --> 40:44.978
I will if you will.

41:03.469 --> 41:05.334
You miss it, don't you?

41:05.404 --> 41:07.429
More than you know.

41:07.506 --> 41:09.565
No, I have the best job
in the world right here.

41:09.642 --> 41:11.610
I'm proud to be your Garfunkel,
Mr. Monk.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.577
You know, we could
both be Garfunkels.

41:13.646 --> 41:14.806
A couple of Garfunkels.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.472
Yeah, maybe.
There's no law against it.

41:16.549 --> 41:17.777
Yeah.

41:18.951 --> 41:20.213
Do you know
who Garfunkel is?

41:20.286 --> 41:23.084
Sure. He's a cartoon cat.
He hates Mondays.

41:23.155 --> 41:25.316
No, that's Garfield.
This is Garfunkel.

41:25.391 --> 41:26.551
Oh! Garfunkel.

41:26.625 --> 41:28.525
Right. It's the thing my
grandmother had on her neck.

41:28.594 --> 41:31.620
No, he's a singer.
Simon and Garfunkel.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.858
Oh, right!
The chipmunks.

41:33.933 --> 41:35.230
No, not the chipmunks.

41:35.301 --> 41:38.065
Bridge Over Troubled Water?
Mrs. Robinson?

41:38.137 --> 41:39.297
What are you
talking about?

41:39.372 --> 41:41.431
Their songs.
Feelin' Groovy?

41:41.507 --> 41:42.838
Oh. So,
they're hippies.

41:42.908 --> 41:43.897
Yeah, I guess so.

41:43.976 --> 41:45.034
Cartoon hippies.

41:45.111 --> 41:47.136
No, not cartoon hippies.
Mr. Monk, come on.
