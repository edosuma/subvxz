WEBVTT

00:01.129 --> 00:02.078
There are two kinds of folks

00:02.135 --> 00:03.735
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:04.069 --> 00:05.795
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:06.033 --> 00:07.055
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:07.456 --> 00:08.055
Who am I?

00:08.145 --> 00:09.284
I'm Rick Castle.

00:09.285 --> 00:09.685
Castle.

00:09.719 --> 00:10.379
Castle.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.080
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:12.134 --> 00:14.324
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.534 --> 00:15.353
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.867
Beckett.
Aah!

00:17.140 --> 00:19.225
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?

00:19.576 --> 00:21.460
<i>And thanks to my friendship</i>
<i>with the Mayor,</i>

00:21.511 --> 00:23.145
<i>I get to be on her case.</i>
Oh!

00:23.179 --> 00:25.748
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:25.782 --> 00:27.416
<i>And together,</i>
<i>we catch killers.</i>

00:27.964 --> 00:31.166
I hate this case.
I know. Isn't it great?

00:35.394 --> 00:37.729
Mom.

00:37.763 --> 00:40.966
Mom.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.735
Mom, are you here?

00:59.685 --> 01:02.120
(Keypabeeping)

01:02.154 --> 01:04.089
Come on.

01:04.123 --> 01:06.191
Come on, mom. Answer.

01:06.225 --> 01:09.828
(Cell phone rings)

01:09.862 --> 01:13.798
(Ring)

01:13.833 --> 01:18.036
(Ring)

01:18.070 --> 01:20.205
(Ring)

01:20.239 --> 01:21.539
(Gasps)

01:21.574 --> 01:24.276
(Ring)

01:24.310 --> 01:26.945
(Grunts) Oh!

01:26.979 --> 01:29.281
Aah!

01:35.061 --> 01:36.628
(Martha) Oh, hello.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.031
Shouldn't you be
in school already?

01:39.065 --> 01:40.833
School doesn't start
for another hour.

01:40.915 --> 01:43.750
Yeah. If you were hoping to do the walk
of shame in private, you're outta luck.

01:43.833 --> 01:47.036
Oh, don't be silly. I just
didn't realize how early it was.

01:47.070 --> 01:50.205
I have been a bit distracted
this morning.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.841
Do you mean distracted,
or hypnotized by that giant rock

01:52.876 --> 01:54.443
on your finger?!
(Laughs)

01:55.416 --> 01:57.484
Wow.
Did Chet Palaburn propose?

01:57.518 --> 02:01.220
Uh, Alexis, I think it's about time
we start calling him Uncle Chet.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.256
Oh, now wait a minute.
Wait a minute, you two.

02:03.305 --> 02:04.640
I am not engaged, all right?

02:04.704 --> 02:06.972
Yes, Chet did propose
last night,

02:07.006 --> 02:09.241
and I told him, you know,
I needed time to think about it,

02:09.275 --> 02:12.110
and he insisted I keep the ring
while I make up my mind, so...

02:12.145 --> 02:13.545
Mm. Smart man.
Mm.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.747
Diamonds can be
very persuasive.

02:15.782 --> 02:18.684
I can hear it now, whispering...
(Whispers) "Keep me. Keep me."

02:18.718 --> 02:23.887
(Laughs) Unfortunately, now that
Chet has upped the ante,

02:23.919 --> 02:26.854
as they say,
I'm going to have to decide

02:26.889 --> 02:28.624
whether I'm in or I'm out.

02:28.659 --> 02:30.960
I thought you loved Chet.

02:30.995 --> 02:33.563
Oh, I do love him, darling.
I really do. I j--I...

02:33.597 --> 02:35.598
Well, you know, it's just
that for me, it's, uh--

02:35.633 --> 02:37.233
the thrill is gone.

02:37.268 --> 02:38.534
Yes,

02:38.569 --> 02:41.771
and it's been gone
for quite a while.

02:41.805 --> 02:43.606
Although this little fella
did bring it back

02:43.641 --> 02:45.575
for about ten minutes.
(Chuckles)
(Laughs)

02:45.609 --> 02:48.354
If he's not the one, then I
guess you shouldn't marry him.

02:48.364 --> 02:49.332
That's never stopped her before.

02:49.893 --> 02:52.094
And we miss having you here all the time.
Aw.

02:52.104 --> 02:54.171
Don't we, dad?

02:54.206 --> 02:56.374
(Martha and Alexis) Dad?
(Cell phone rings)

02:56.408 --> 02:58.175
Mm.
Saved by the Bell.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.277
(Beeps)

02:59.311 --> 03:01.946
Ah, it's Beckett.
Castle.

03:02.621 --> 03:04.288
Hey, did I hear you right?

03:04.323 --> 03:07.892
Our victim is Vivien Marchand,
the psychic medium?

03:07.926 --> 03:09.393
You've heard of her?

03:09.428 --> 03:11.796
Yeah. She was very popular
in certain Manhattan circles.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.198
Huh.
Matter of fact, she did a reading for me

03:14.233 --> 03:16.133
at a society party
about eight years ago.

03:16.168 --> 03:17.869
It was pretty extraordinary.

03:17.903 --> 03:19.203
"Extraordinary"?

03:19.238 --> 03:20.671
She got <i>everything</i> right.

03:20.706 --> 03:22.573
You know what?
Come to think of it,

03:22.608 --> 03:24.876
she told me
that a beautiful woman

03:24.910 --> 03:28.246
would one day move into my loft
and stay with me forever.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.182
She neglected to mention
it was my mother.

03:31.216 --> 03:33.751
(Ryan chuckles)
How did she die?

03:33.785 --> 03:36.220
Stabbed in the back of the neck
with an ice pick,

03:36.255 --> 03:39.956
and then stuffed into the sofa.
So she didn't see that coming.

03:40.322 --> 03:41.256
(Beckett)
When did she die?

03:41.293 --> 03:44.361
She's in full rigor.
I'd say yesterday afternoon

03:44.396 --> 03:46.730
is the approximate time of death.
(Esposito) I got a maintenance worker

03:46.765 --> 03:48.699
said he saw a man
leaving the back door

03:48.733 --> 03:51.702
of Vivien's office around 2:30
yesterday afternoon.
Description?

03:51.736 --> 03:53.971
Tall, Caucasian and tough looking.
All right, Ryan, check Vivien's calendar,

03:54.005 --> 03:55.940
and let's interview
her clients from yesterday.

03:55.974 --> 03:58.008
Maybe one of them
saw the guy.

03:58.043 --> 04:00.611
What I don't get is,
why put her in the couch?

04:00.645 --> 04:02.513
(Lanie) She was alive
when she went in.

04:02.597 --> 04:04.765
These scratches on her face
indicate that she tried to move.

04:06.025 --> 04:09.027
I'm gonna get her
back the lab.

04:09.061 --> 04:11.229
She's got a notation here
for 3:00 P.M. yesterday.

04:11.264 --> 04:13.665
It just says "T.J."

04:13.699 --> 04:15.267
And nothing else?

04:15.301 --> 04:17.336
Nope. Maybe T.J. was a ghost
coming to visit.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.498
Mediums are the ones that can
see ghosts, right, castle?

04:19.507 --> 04:20.684
Yes, psychics can tell the future.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.529
Mediums can tell the future
and talk to the dead.

04:23.612 --> 04:25.747
That's like saying
that psychics are con artists,

04:25.781 --> 04:27.749
and mediums are con artists
and charlatans.

04:28.814 --> 04:30.148
I mean, in the end,
they're all just fakes.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.494
You sound pretty certain
of yourself.

04:32.528 --> 04:33.963
That's because
when I started as a cop,

04:34.002 --> 04:37.104
I wasted a lot of time on
clairvoyants calling tip lines

04:37.139 --> 04:39.840
with information
that <i>never</i> led to anything.

04:40.512 --> 04:41.980
I mean, I'm surprised
you're so gullible.

04:41.988 --> 04:43.522
I'm not saying
I can speak with the dead.

04:43.609 --> 04:46.277
I'm just willing to admit that
there are people in this world

04:46.312 --> 04:49.514
who are more sensitive than me.
Now that's not hard to believe.

04:51.134 --> 04:53.469
Walked right into that one.
Mm-hmm.

04:53.503 --> 04:54.804
(Beckett) Ms. Marchand,
do you know of anyone

04:54.887 --> 04:56.989
that might have wanted
to harm your mother?

04:57.023 --> 04:59.324
(Sniffles) She was
a very spiritual person.

04:59.359 --> 05:00.792
She didn't have any enemies.

05:00.827 --> 05:03.061
A witness saw a tall,
dark-haired man

05:03.096 --> 05:05.597
leaving here
around 2:30 yesterday.

05:05.631 --> 05:07.899
Does that sound like
anyone your mother knows?

05:07.934 --> 05:10.202
When was the last time
you two talked?

05:10.236 --> 05:11.703
Around 1:00.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.255
She said she had
her last client of the day,

05:15.290 --> 05:18.825
and then she was gonna spend
the afternoon in meditation.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.994
Do you know
the client's name?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.929
No. It was a mother
and a daughter.

05:22.964 --> 05:24.965
Their names should be
in her book.

05:24.999 --> 05:27.968
Well, there was a notation
in her calendar

05:28.002 --> 05:30.771
at 3:00--
the initials "T.J."

05:31.778 --> 05:33.946
Does that mean anything
to you?

05:33.980 --> 05:36.448
No. I'm sorry
I can't be more helpful.

05:36.483 --> 05:39.418
Hey, I remember this case.

05:39.452 --> 05:41.186
A guy's wife goes missing,

05:41.221 --> 05:42.955
he seems genuinely distraught,

05:42.989 --> 05:44.890
and then the cops find out
he had a girlfriend

05:44.924 --> 05:47.092
and that his marriage
was on the rocks.
Yeah.

05:47.127 --> 05:49.061
Did your mother
help on that case?

05:49.129 --> 05:51.363
Yeah, she had a vision of him
at a local bar

05:51.398 --> 05:53.265
with this pretty blonde
named Amber,

05:53.300 --> 05:55.234
so she went to the police
with the information.

05:55.268 --> 05:57.836
That's when they started
looking at him as a suspect.

05:57.871 --> 06:00.005
And then what happened?
He went to prison.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.174
That case really
put my mom on the map.

06:02.208 --> 06:03.809
Did your mother continue

06:03.843 --> 06:07.078
offering the police help after that?
Yes, all over the country.

06:07.113 --> 06:09.248
My mother helped put away
over a dozen people

06:09.282 --> 06:11.917
in the last ten years.

06:11.952 --> 06:14.253
So here's the list of all
the people that Penny Marchand

06:14.287 --> 06:16.155
claims her mom
helped to convict.

06:16.189 --> 06:17.723
Let's see if any of them
are out of jail

06:17.747 --> 06:19.481
and still holding a grudge.
On it.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.434
Vivien's 1:00 Monday clients
are here.

06:21.469 --> 06:23.003
They say they got a good look

06:23.032 --> 06:24.633
at the dark-haired guy
who was in her office.

06:24.662 --> 06:26.562
Names are
Paula and Marina Casillas.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.755
"Casillas"?
That's a good name.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.190
Hard to possessive pluralize,
though.

06:32.397 --> 06:34.131
(Imitates Ricardo Montalban)
The Casillases' car

06:34.166 --> 06:35.700
has broken down,

06:35.734 --> 06:36.969
so they will be late
for the symphony.

06:36.987 --> 06:39.422
The casillas--s--
casillases-es...

06:40.573 --> 06:41.374
They're waiting for you
in the lounge.

06:41.389 --> 06:42.857
All right. Thanks.

06:44.836 --> 06:46.838
Usually, we're her
last clients on Monday,

06:46.872 --> 06:48.139
but when we left,

06:48.215 --> 06:50.049
there was a man there
waiting for Vivien.

06:50.083 --> 06:53.285
She seemed surprised to see him,
like he wasn't expected.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.387
Oh, and he seemed upset.
I could tell.

06:55.422 --> 06:58.457
Could you describe him?
He was wearing dark clothes.

06:58.492 --> 07:00.960
He had black hair,
going gray at the temples.

07:00.994 --> 07:03.562
Oh, and he had a scar
on his face.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.464
I think
she called him Alfred.

07:05.499 --> 07:07.166
Or was it Albert?

07:07.200 --> 07:09.835
Okay. Well, thank you, both.
You've been very helpful.

07:09.870 --> 07:11.709
How long had you
been going to see Vivien?

07:11.719 --> 07:13.143
Four months.

07:13.437 --> 07:15.838
My husband Emilio
passed away in April.

07:17.009 --> 07:19.243
We both miss him so much.

07:19.278 --> 07:20.662
So she was helping you
get closure.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.033
Yes.

07:22.063 --> 07:24.665
Even at our first session,
Vivien...

07:24.699 --> 07:28.268
Already knew so much
about my Emilio.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.365
Like what?

07:29.421 --> 07:31.989
Well, she knew
he made vitamins for a living.

07:32.024 --> 07:34.759
She knew
he loved arroz con pollo.

07:34.793 --> 07:37.361
She also knew
he was a workaholic.

07:37.396 --> 07:39.663
And that he even died
at the office.

07:39.698 --> 07:41.198
Vivien said
she thought daddy

07:41.233 --> 07:43.634
had something very important
to tell us.

07:43.668 --> 07:47.405
She was going to commune
with his spirit last night.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.675
Now we'll never know.

07:52.698 --> 07:55.000
You're not gonna believe this.

07:55.012 --> 07:58.848
Vivien's daughter is pretty sure
that "Albert" is Albert Moreno.

07:58.882 --> 08:00.293
Albert "The Blade" Moreno?

08:00.637 --> 08:02.571
Former muscle
for the Spolano crime family.

08:02.605 --> 08:05.440
So Vivien helped put him away.
Mnh-mnh. He's her client.

08:06.388 --> 08:08.085
Vivien told Albert
that if he if he invested in

08:08.218 --> 08:10.853
a New Jersey real estate deal,
true happiness would be his.

08:10.887 --> 08:13.489
The deal fell through a month
ago. He lost everything.

08:13.523 --> 08:16.826
Ouch. You give a guy
like that bad advice,

08:16.860 --> 08:19.328
he'll see to it you are
sleeping with the fishes.

08:19.362 --> 08:22.131
Or you get stabbed in the neck
wi an ice pick...

08:23.292 --> 08:25.961
And stuffed in a couch.

08:25.995 --> 08:29.497

08:35.528 --> 08:38.163
(Castle) Whoa.

08:38.197 --> 08:40.164
Albert Moreno
is sure living large

08:40.198 --> 08:42.299
for a low-level mobster.

08:42.335 --> 08:44.302
Well, I guess mob money
goes a little farther

08:44.337 --> 08:46.238
when you don't pay taxes
on it.

08:46.272 --> 08:49.174
And yet, for Albert,
not quite far enough.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.476
Loreen Carter
from real smart real estate.

08:51.511 --> 08:54.446
This house
is a Tuscan jewel,

08:54.480 --> 08:56.181
and it's perfect
for a young couple.

08:56.215 --> 08:57.883
We're here for Mr. Moreno.

08:57.917 --> 09:00.585
Yes. I went to see her.

09:00.620 --> 09:01.287
Three months ago,

09:01.358 --> 09:04.494
Vivien told me I should invest
in some real estate deal.

09:04.528 --> 09:07.563
She knew that I had...

09:09.085 --> 09:09.952
Quit my day job.

09:09.977 --> 09:12.112
I was looking to set myself up
for retirement.

09:12.146 --> 09:14.648
She told you the investment
would bring you true happiness,

09:14.682 --> 09:17.184
but instead,
you lost it all.

09:17.218 --> 09:19.853
I was...

09:19.887 --> 09:21.388
Upset.

09:22.043 --> 09:23.849
And then she canceled
our last appointment

09:23.949 --> 09:25.783
and stopped returning
my phone calls.

09:25.818 --> 09:26.921
And then you decided
to pay her a visit

09:27.190 --> 09:28.423
yesterday around 2:00?

09:27.659 --> 09:29.626
I told her, I'm on my way
to meet my broker.

09:30.892 --> 09:33.226
I'm selling my home because I
can't pay my mortgage no more.

09:33.261 --> 09:35.195
And then what happened,
Mr. Moreno? Did you get angry?

09:35.229 --> 09:36.863
Did things get physical?

09:36.898 --> 09:40.067
No. But I was mad.

09:41.186 --> 09:44.455
And when I'm mad,
sometimes people get nervous.

09:44.548 --> 09:45.148
(Gulps)

09:45.173 --> 09:47.341
She begged me
to let the universe

09:47.375 --> 09:48.842
sort itself out,

09:49.828 --> 09:52.663
and she said she was late
for an appointment Uptown.

09:52.683 --> 09:53.917
Did she say with whom?

09:53.948 --> 09:56.750
No. By then, I was late
to meet my broker,

09:56.784 --> 09:58.952
so I left, about 2:30.

09:58.986 --> 10:00.653
And just like that...

10:03.724 --> 10:05.358
The universe?

10:05.392 --> 10:08.595
It sorted itself out.

10:10.845 --> 10:12.881
I'm--I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

10:12.951 --> 10:15.253
Turns out, my, uh,
broker's partner

10:15.287 --> 10:19.390
is, uh, Loreen here,
my High School sweetheart.

10:19.424 --> 10:20.925
(Kisses)
(Loreen chuckles)

10:20.959 --> 10:23.895
We broke up in '82, but we
never got over each other.

10:23.929 --> 10:25.897
The minute I laid eyes
on her again,

10:25.931 --> 10:27.899
I haven't left her side,

10:27.933 --> 10:30.434
and I never been so happy.

10:30.469 --> 10:32.370
(Castle)
So... Vivien was right.

10:32.404 --> 10:34.372
Investing
in the real estate deal

10:34.406 --> 10:35.940
brought you to bankruptcy,

10:35.974 --> 10:38.442
which, in turn,
brought you to Loreen

10:38.477 --> 10:41.212
and true happiness.

10:42.489 --> 10:44.657
Extraordinary.

10:44.691 --> 10:45.825
(Sighs)

10:45.859 --> 10:46.760
(Castle)
So what do you think?

10:46.765 --> 10:48.979
Well, I think it's possible
he might have killed Vivien

10:49.079 --> 10:51.013
before the universe
righted itself.

10:51.181 --> 10:53.149
Not about that.
About them--Albert and Loreen.

10:53.741 --> 10:56.276
I mean, star-crossed lovers
reunited by fate.

10:56.310 --> 10:58.478
You mean
reunited by coincidence.

10:58.513 --> 11:00.447
Oh, let me guess.
You don't believe in fate.

11:00.481 --> 11:01.982
Soul mates?

11:02.016 --> 11:03.283
No.

11:03.317 --> 11:06.386
Unicorns, fairies,
double rainbows?

11:06.421 --> 11:07.956
Didn't you ever think your dolls
used to get up at night

11:08.015 --> 11:09.983
and play with your toys?
Sorry.

11:10.508 --> 11:11.942
Mm. Let me guess.

11:12.419 --> 11:14.320
You were one of those
annoying 6 year olds

11:15.095 --> 11:16.596
who stopped believing
in Santa Claus

11:16.673 --> 11:17.807
because you figured out
he couldn't travel

11:17.851 --> 11:19.285
faster than the speed of light.

11:19.359 --> 11:21.660
I was 3,
and we didn't have a chimney.

11:29.127 --> 11:30.395
(Esposito) How'd it go
with Moreno?

11:30.442 --> 11:32.010
My gut says it's not him.

11:32.097 --> 11:34.499
But we still have to
look into his alibi.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.462
Oh, so you don't believe
in fate,

11:36.463 --> 11:38.765
yet your "gut"
has magical properties.

11:40.041 --> 11:42.509
That's cool, Scully.

11:42.543 --> 11:44.678
We got calls out on most
of Vivien's dirty dozen.

11:44.712 --> 11:46.720
We should hear back tomorrow.
Meanwhile, we've been

11:46.906 --> 11:49.041
going through her client files--
trips to the hall of records,

11:49.075 --> 11:51.777
Internet searches, even got
ahold of some autopsy files.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.712
Pretty intimate stuff, too.
You see, castle?

11:54.662 --> 11:56.563
Research--that's how
she made people believe

11:57.682 --> 11:58.349
that she has a gift.

11:58.441 --> 12:01.310
And I bet that she even
looked into you eight years ago

12:01.344 --> 12:03.245
when she went to that party.

12:03.279 --> 12:05.080
And I bet she looked up
Paula Casillas as well.

12:05.123 --> 12:07.023
That's how she knew
that her husband Emilio

12:07.058 --> 12:08.959
had a vitamin business.
Is that also how she knew

12:09.026 --> 12:11.394
that Albert Moreno would find
true love through bankruptcy?

12:11.429 --> 12:13.063
She got lucky.

12:13.097 --> 12:15.831
Oh. Or maybe it's just
that she couldn't get

12:15.885 --> 12:17.953
everything she needed
from her abilities alone

12:17.987 --> 12:20.655
and needed to do
a little extra digging.

12:20.690 --> 12:22.857
I have
a fantastic imagination,

12:22.892 --> 12:24.826
yet I still do
a ton of research

12:24.860 --> 12:27.062
when I write a book.

12:31.621 --> 12:32.889
Surrounded by skeptics.

12:32.894 --> 12:35.363
It's called
being a cop, bro.

12:36.483 --> 12:39.085
(Alexis) Oh,
great and powerful spirits,

12:39.166 --> 12:41.867
tell us, should Gram break up
with Chet Palaburn?

12:44.171 --> 12:46.906
Ugh!
This thing must be broken.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.942
Well, luckily, I don't need
the spirits to tell me

12:49.977 --> 12:52.378
when it's time
to say good-bye.

12:52.412 --> 12:55.147
Good-bye, my love.
What if you're being too hasty?

12:55.182 --> 12:57.116
Relationships take work,
right?

12:57.150 --> 12:59.018
No, no, no, love is not
about work. Trust me.

12:59.052 --> 13:01.754
It's about passion.
It's about chemistry, romance.

13:01.788 --> 13:03.789
It's about
your heart pounding faster

13:03.824 --> 13:05.453
because you can't wait to see her.

13:05.463 --> 13:07.259
Can either of you look back
on a relationship

13:07.294 --> 13:08.995
that ended
because the thrill was gone,

13:09.029 --> 13:11.764
and admit that maybe,
you gave up on love too soon?

13:12.877 --> 13:14.379
Dad, you're back
with your ex-wife.

13:14.382 --> 13:16.083
Ooh. No, she's right.
Yeah, with Gina.

13:16.898 --> 13:18.999
The thrill was long,
long gone.

13:19.034 --> 13:21.602
Now... it is back
with a vengeance.

13:22.436 --> 13:23.537
Of course, it brought along
its friends,

13:23.539 --> 13:26.040
high maintenance
and shopaholic.

13:26.074 --> 13:29.010
No, I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry.

13:30.316 --> 13:32.217
But it's just--it's over.

13:32.251 --> 13:34.186
I know it.

13:45.031 --> 13:46.665
(Castle) Hey.

13:46.732 --> 13:48.733
Any news
on the dirty dozen?

13:48.768 --> 13:50.702
Oh, most are
still in prison,

13:50.736 --> 13:54.105
but we're thinking
this line of investigation

13:54.140 --> 13:55.908
may not get us anywhere.
Why not?

13:55.938 --> 13:57.840
I called around to a couple
of lead detectives,

13:57.844 --> 13:59.778
just to check out the level
of Vivien's involvement.

13:59.813 --> 14:03.014
They say, they've never even
heard of her.

14:03.345 --> 14:05.846
She exaggerated her involvement
in these cases

14:05.881 --> 14:07.882
in order to build
her reputation back up.

14:08.487 --> 14:10.388
Or maybe the cops
didn't want to admit

14:10.422 --> 14:14.392
that they had... a psychic
actually helping them.

14:14.426 --> 14:17.428
I mean, what police Detective
would willingly acknowledge

14:18.426 --> 14:21.728
that a layperson is
as talented at solving crimes

14:21.762 --> 14:23.363
as she is?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.334
Vivien Marchand...

14:27.356 --> 14:28.757
Is not a psychic.

14:28.791 --> 14:30.625
I'd bet my badge on it.

14:30.660 --> 14:33.161
Don't throw those dice
until you take a look at this.

14:33.196 --> 14:35.330
"New York homicide division
Detective squad."

14:35.364 --> 14:37.632
It's from Vivien Marchand.

14:38.576 --> 14:39.943
Yeah,
it arrived this morning,

14:39.947 --> 14:42.115
postmarked Monday,
the day she died.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.217
That is her letterhead.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.253
"To whom it may concern, I feel
that my murder is imminent."
(Squeals)

14:51.978 --> 14:53.513
"And although
I have no idea yet

14:53.524 --> 14:55.225
"where or when
this event will occur,

14:55.323 --> 14:57.324
"I have had a vision
of my death.

14:57.389 --> 14:59.490
"In the vision,
I could not breathe.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.626
"I saw a man dressed in black,
the number 7-5-1-8,

15:02.661 --> 15:04.562
"and I could hear
a furious pounding

15:04.596 --> 15:06.864
"from what seemed to be
far away.

15:06.898 --> 15:08.832
I'm sorry I cannot be
more specific"--

15:08.867 --> 15:12.136
the psychic predicted
her own murder!

15:13.605 --> 15:16.407
Or the killer wrote this
in order to throw us off.

15:16.441 --> 15:19.109
Run it. Maybe we'll
get lucky with the prints.

15:19.144 --> 15:21.078
Do you think she really--
no.

15:21.112 --> 15:22.546
Yeah, me neither.

15:24.325 --> 15:25.759
Hey, Lanie.
What do we got?

15:25.838 --> 15:28.673
We've got cause of death--
blood loss and asphyxiation.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.609
And I'm officially putting
the time of death

15:30.643 --> 15:33.078
between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.
on Monday evening.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.503
So that rules out
Albert Moreno. What else?

15:35.589 --> 15:38.324
There were no scratches
on the ice pick blade.

15:38.358 --> 15:40.293
It was brand-new,

15:40.327 --> 15:42.228
probably bought specialist for the  occasion.

15:43.143 --> 15:46.245
And her cell phone
was in her hand.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.347
She may have tried to dial
for help before she expired.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.983
The digits match the beginning
of her daughter's phone number.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.853
1-718-55--

15:53.887 --> 15:55.621
7-1-8-5?

15:57.150 --> 15:58.551
Those are the numbers
from the letter.

15:58.552 --> 16:02.956
They're in a different order,
but those are the same numbers.

16:02.990 --> 16:05.792
Oh, go on. Go on.
Say "coincidence."

16:05.826 --> 16:07.427
Coincidence.

16:07.461 --> 16:09.362
I'm just saying,
it's irrefutable, that's all.

16:09.397 --> 16:11.664
It is not irrefutable,
Castle.

16:11.699 --> 16:14.067
As a matter of fact,
it is completely refutable.

16:14.819 --> 16:17.020
Okay, go on. Refute me.

16:17.055 --> 16:18.522
Okay, how about this?

16:18.556 --> 16:20.724
Vivien is dialing
her daughter's number.

16:20.758 --> 16:22.659
Our killer comes in,
stabs her in the neck,

16:22.727 --> 16:23.394
picks up the phone,

16:23.457 --> 16:25.358
drops it into the sofa
after her,

16:25.392 --> 16:27.193
and then puts the numbers
into the letter

16:27.227 --> 16:29.095
along with the rest
of the fake predictions.

16:30.316 --> 16:31.917
Refuted.

16:31.951 --> 16:35.654
No one types a number
into a cell phone anymore.

16:35.688 --> 16:37.889
Preliminaries on the letter
aren't giving us much.

16:37.924 --> 16:39.892
There are no usable prints
and no D.N.A.

16:39.937 --> 16:42.071
And the pick up at the mail drop
in Vivien's building

16:42.106 --> 16:43.540
is 6:00 P.M.

16:43.574 --> 16:45.475
Time enough for the killer
to have written it

16:45.509 --> 16:47.710
and mailed it
after she was dead.

16:47.745 --> 16:50.413
But why? Why go through
all that trouble?

16:50.747 --> 16:52.848
To keep us spinning
wild theories

16:52.922 --> 16:54.623
and chasing after
men dressed in black

16:54.717 --> 16:56.584
instead of following
hard evidence.

16:56.618 --> 16:59.120
I mean, come on, Castle.
The letter's not even signed.

16:59.904 --> 17:02.740
Actually, I talked to
Penny Marchand about that.

17:02.774 --> 17:04.008
She says it's possible
her mother

17:04.037 --> 17:05.771
would type a letter
and not sign it

17:05.832 --> 17:07.400
in case her prediction
was wrong.

17:07.434 --> 17:08.902
She wouldn't want anybody
selling her mistakes

17:08.946 --> 17:11.482
on the Internet. (Laughs)
But we still can't prove

17:11.516 --> 17:14.484
that Vivien actually wrote the letter.
Until her other predictions come true.

17:16.241 --> 17:17.974
You know, I'm just...

17:18.010 --> 17:20.645
Good. You're back.
I think I got something.

17:20.679 --> 17:22.714
Remember Vivien's
first big case?

17:22.989 --> 17:24.557
Yeah, the guy
with the missing wife

17:24.557 --> 17:26.825
and the blonde girlfriend named Amber.
His name is Steve Adams.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.894
Unis are bringing him up
right now.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.395
They never found
his wife's body.

17:30.429 --> 17:32.163
He did seven years
for second degree.

17:32.198 --> 17:33.899
They released him
two months ago on parole,

17:33.905 --> 17:35.306
only after he agreed to wear

17:35.385 --> 17:36.920
an anklet
with a tracking device.

17:36.948 --> 17:39.316
So I called his P.O.,
and he sent over this.

17:42.885 --> 17:45.121
The GPS readout puts Steve
at Vivien's address

17:45.171 --> 17:46.772
Monday afternoon.

17:48.465 --> 17:51.268
So Vivien finishes with Paula
and Marina Casillas at 2:00,

17:51.322 --> 17:54.358
Albert Moreno exists out
the back door at 2:30,

17:54.392 --> 17:57.027
and now it's time for her
3:00 P.M. with T.J.

17:57.866 --> 18:01.736
Steve Adams was there
from 1:36 to 2:48,

18:01.770 --> 18:03.939
waiting for his opportunity.

18:03.964 --> 18:05.932
So he waits there
until she's alone,

18:05.966 --> 18:09.402
jumps her, stabs her, and then
stuffs her in the couch.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.304
(Man) This is harassment!
(Man) Take it easy.

18:11.338 --> 18:14.006
I haven't done anything wrong!

18:15.721 --> 18:17.022
(Man) Right through here.
Calm down.

18:17.061 --> 18:18.995
Ah. He's wearing all black.

18:19.029 --> 18:22.031
It's gotta be a coincidence.

18:22.066 --> 18:24.234
Or black is the new guilty.

18:33.088 --> 18:34.522
I didn't kill her.

18:34.556 --> 18:37.458
You were the last one
to see her alive.

18:37.493 --> 18:40.695
The GPS on your anklet indicates
that you were at Vivien's office

18:40.729 --> 18:42.630
for over an hour
the day that she was killed.

18:43.237 --> 18:45.138
Yeah, but it's not
what you think.

18:45.173 --> 18:47.974
Last week, I got a call
from a guy named Cody Donnelly.

18:48.009 --> 18:49.543
He's a Reality TV Producer.

18:49.577 --> 18:52.313
He said he could help me clear my name.
How was he gonna do that?

18:52.356 --> 18:54.290
The day after
my wife disappeared,

18:54.325 --> 18:56.793
Vivien Marchand told the cops
she had a vision of me in a bar,

18:56.830 --> 18:59.131
with my girlfriend Amber.
Which was true.

18:59.165 --> 19:00.766
That I was there? Yeah.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.441
But then she started saying
she had other visions--

19:02.476 --> 19:04.878
visions that I murdered my wife,
which I did not do--

19:06.029 --> 19:07.763
but she was right once,
about Amber,

19:07.798 --> 19:09.265
so everyone believed her.

19:10.702 --> 19:12.469
Only Vivien
had lied about that, too.

19:12.504 --> 19:13.672
What do you mean?

19:13.730 --> 19:15.898
Cody donnelly told me
he had proof that Vivien

19:15.981 --> 19:18.449
was a customer in the same bar
where I took Amber that day.

19:19.145 --> 19:21.046
So she saw me, all right,
with her own eyes.

19:22.155 --> 19:23.989
There was nothing psychic
about it, <i>nothing.</i>

19:24.022 --> 19:26.390
So you figured if you could
prove that Vivien was a fraud,

19:26.424 --> 19:27.858
that maybe
people would believe

19:27.892 --> 19:29.226
that you hadn't
killed your wife as well.

19:29.311 --> 19:32.079
I'm an innocent man,
but thanks to Vivien,

19:32.262 --> 19:35.764
everyone in the state
believed that I killed my wife.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.207
She got a book deal.

19:38.763 --> 19:40.464
I got 7 to 10.

19:40.498 --> 19:41.999
And what was in it
for Cody Donnelly?

19:42.017 --> 19:43.952
He wanted me and Vivien to be
in his reality show,

19:44.044 --> 19:46.712
"you've Ruined My Life."
Oh, I love that show.

19:47.355 --> 19:49.357
I-it's where people unleash
their righteous fury

19:49.444 --> 19:51.378
against those
who have wronged them.

19:51.413 --> 19:54.081
Usually ends in tears and a hug.
Cody and me,

19:54.115 --> 19:56.050
we went to her office
with a camera crew.

19:56.084 --> 19:58.185
We sat outside in the van
for almost an hour.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.521
When she finally came out,
I confronted her.

20:00.555 --> 20:03.357
I called her a fake. Cody told
me to make it big, so I did.

20:04.514 --> 20:05.915
And what did Vivien do?

20:05.949 --> 20:07.383
Mostly she freaked.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.352
Then she got in a cab
and took off.

20:09.386 --> 20:12.588
Cody dropped me at my apartment
on Second and 45th,

20:12.623 --> 20:14.423
and I never saw her again.

20:15.129 --> 20:17.931
GPS puts Adams
at his apartment

20:17.972 --> 20:19.873
at the time
that Vivien was murdered.

20:19.896 --> 20:21.830
Find me some witnesses
that can verify that.

20:22.616 --> 20:23.850
You don't trust
the GPS?

20:23.942 --> 20:26.611
No, those things
can be tampered with.

20:26.645 --> 20:28.647
So Vivien told her daughter

20:28.738 --> 20:30.674
that she was gonna be
at the office all afternoon,

20:30.744 --> 20:34.912
and then at 2:45,
she takes a cab and leaves

20:34.940 --> 20:37.108
to see T.J.,
whoever that is.

20:37.143 --> 20:40.011
Let's get ahold of Steve Adams'
producer, Cody Donnelly.

20:40.386 --> 20:42.021
I want to see him
and his footage of Vivien

20:42.113 --> 20:42.813
first thing in the morning.

20:42.861 --> 20:44.828
You got it.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.119
(Door opens)

20:54.153 --> 20:56.020
(Door closes)

20:56.055 --> 20:58.256
I am so glad
that you are home.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.225
You would not believe
the day I had.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.193
Oh, I think
I got you beat.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.162
Mother, what's wrong?

21:04.196 --> 21:07.031
And why are you still
engaged to Uncle Chet?

21:07.066 --> 21:08.500
Oh, Richard.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.469
(Exhales)

21:11.504 --> 21:13.071
Chet is dead.

21:14.535 --> 21:16.469
What?

21:16.504 --> 21:18.606
How?

21:18.698 --> 21:20.832
I went to his apartment
this morning,

21:20.867 --> 21:23.336
and his kids are there--
Boomer and Lotte.

21:23.374 --> 21:24.774
They said...

21:24.809 --> 21:27.210
He'd had a stroke
in his sleep.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.646
(Voice breaking)
I mean, God, I...

21:29.680 --> 21:32.582
He was so young, and...

21:32.617 --> 21:34.584
Mother, I am so sorry.

21:34.619 --> 21:36.086
Mm.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.788
So...
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

21:39.691 --> 21:41.158
Boomer and Lotte
see the ring.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.872
Naturally they assume that
their father and I are engaged,

21:43.906 --> 21:46.774
and now they're worried about
how I'll handle the news.

21:46.809 --> 21:48.643
And, uh,

21:48.677 --> 21:50.578
so I spent
the whole day with them,

21:50.613 --> 21:52.881
receiving visitors.

21:52.915 --> 21:55.316
And they kept telling me...

21:55.351 --> 21:59.419
How happy their father had been
since we'd been together,

21:59.622 --> 22:01.990
and how I was...

22:04.960 --> 22:08.630
The love of his life.

22:08.664 --> 22:12.500
And there I was,
about to break his heart.

22:12.535 --> 22:14.035
Mm.

22:14.069 --> 22:17.038
And now they want me
to give the eulogy.

22:17.072 --> 22:18.807
I don't think I can.

22:19.889 --> 22:21.456
Oh, Richard.

22:21.490 --> 22:23.425
Mom, I'm sorry.
I know.

22:23.459 --> 22:25.861
I'm sorry.
It's just so... (Sniffles)

22:27.064 --> 22:28.065
<i>(Man) Go, go, go, go.</i>
<i>There she is.</i>

22:28.099 --> 22:29.783
<i>All right. I see her.</i>
<i>Go get her. Let's do this.</i>
<i>You remember me?</i>

22:29.793 --> 22:31.893
<i>Vivien Marchand.</i>
<i>remember me?.</i>

22:31.933 --> 22:33.601
<i>You told the cops that you had</i>
<i>a vision of me in a bar.</i>

22:33.678 --> 22:36.380
Is that the footage from Cody Donnelly?
<i>We have evidence that you were</i>
<i>in the same bar that day.</i>

22:36.414 --> 22:38.816
Yep. He's waiting for you
in interrogation.
<i>(Vivien) No,</i>
<i>i don't know you...</i>

22:38.866 --> 22:39.448
Where's castle?

22:39.458 --> 22:41.184
Oh, he had some personal issues
he had to deal with.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.122
What do we got?

22:42.132 --> 22:43.773
So far, it's going just like
Steve Adams says.

22:44.105 --> 22:47.090
Vivien comes out,
he gets in her face.

22:47.107 --> 22:48.874
<i>And I can prove it...</i>
<i>Get him outta here...</i>

22:48.981 --> 22:51.349
She gets in the cab.
And we get a partial on the license plate.

22:52.328 --> 22:53.363
I'll run it down.
See if I can find out

22:53.420 --> 22:55.579
where the taxi dropped her off.
Turn it off. Turn it off.

22:55.588 --> 22:57.022
Detective Beckett.
(Clicks key, video stops)

22:57.057 --> 22:59.191
Hi, Penny.
What are you doing here?

23:00.038 --> 23:02.073
Is there somewhere
we could talk privately?

23:02.932 --> 23:05.267
What's wrong?
Did you remember something?

23:05.301 --> 23:06.668
No.

23:07.722 --> 23:10.390
It's not that.

23:10.424 --> 23:12.593
I'm afraid I wasn't
completely honest with you

23:12.659 --> 23:13.993
the other day.

23:14.044 --> 23:14.845
The fact is,

23:14.883 --> 23:17.252
I have a little bit
of what my mother did.

23:18.290 --> 23:21.225
Sometimes I have dreams
that are meaningful.

23:21.260 --> 23:23.370
Last night,
I had a dream about you.

23:24.271 --> 23:25.372
Okay.

23:25.451 --> 23:27.819
And I can't really explain why,
but I feel very strongly

23:27.854 --> 23:29.788
that I'm supposed to
tell you something,

23:29.822 --> 23:32.257
something important. Are you ready?
I'm ready.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.806
Alexander.
Alexander?

23:33.906 --> 23:36.174
Alexander. I don't know who he
is or what he means to you.

23:36.208 --> 23:38.977
I don't know any Alexander.
You will. You will meet an Alexander.

23:40.497 --> 23:43.633
And he will be
extremely important to you.

23:43.667 --> 23:46.402
At some future date,
he may save your life.

23:46.436 --> 23:47.703
Okay.

23:47.738 --> 23:49.639
Um, good to know.

23:49.673 --> 23:51.874
Thank you, Detective.

23:51.909 --> 23:53.910
Thank you, Penny.

23:59.283 --> 24:01.217
Candid reality gold, mate.

24:01.236 --> 24:03.270
Cody Donnelly presents--
famous mystery writer

24:03.304 --> 24:05.739
follows a tough but beautiful
New York cop around

24:05.774 --> 24:07.741
"for research."

24:08.705 --> 24:11.073
Ah, she'd never go for it.
She's a real b--

24:11.107 --> 24:13.008
Mr. Donnelly,
I appreciate you coming...

24:14.073 --> 24:15.307
What are you doing here?

24:15.328 --> 24:18.063
Uh, for the record, I was
gonna say "big rule follower."

24:18.097 --> 24:21.266
I was not discussing the case.
I swear to God.

24:21.300 --> 24:23.035
Uh, "Naked Heat"
comes out tomorrow,

24:23.069 --> 24:25.003
and Cody here
was admiring the billboards.

24:25.038 --> 24:27.053
Is that your smoking-hot
silhouette on the posters then?

24:27.663 --> 24:28.383
No.

24:28.436 --> 24:30.238
So, Mr. donnelly,
where did you go

24:30.265 --> 24:31.699
after you left
Vivien's office?

24:31.733 --> 24:33.668
After we got
all that great footage,

24:33.702 --> 24:35.603
I dropped Steve off
at his place

24:35.637 --> 24:37.371
around, uh, well, 3:30 or so.

24:38.824 --> 24:41.259
That was just before
Vivien Marchand called me.

24:41.293 --> 24:42.594
Really?
And what did she want?

24:42.608 --> 24:44.009
To save what was left
of her career.

24:44.017 --> 24:45.918
I mean, she knew the film
I had on her was damaging.

24:46.471 --> 24:48.472
She said if I buried it,
she'd give me something better.

24:48.506 --> 24:50.073
Better like what?

24:50.107 --> 24:52.242
Better like murder.

24:52.276 --> 24:54.377
You see, Vivien said she was
hot on a killer.

24:54.412 --> 24:56.180
She said it was bigger
than Steve Adams.

24:56.232 --> 24:57.833
This time, there was a body.

24:57.881 --> 25:00.666
She was gonna let me film
the moment that she confronted

25:00.745 --> 25:01.679
the soon-to-be accused.

25:01.739 --> 25:04.173
She said that she had to confirm
one last suspicion,

25:04.208 --> 25:06.976
and that I had to be ready to go
at a moment's notice

25:07.011 --> 25:08.189
'cause we were gonna catch a killer.

25:08.199 --> 25:10.368
And when was this confrontation
gonna take place?

25:10.468 --> 25:13.437
Straightaway. I got an urgent
text about two hours later.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.439
I-I gathered up my crew,
including security,

25:15.473 --> 25:16.940
thinking this was it.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.942
And then when I called her back,
no answer.

25:20.350 --> 25:22.351
I'm guessing
she was already dead.

25:29.887 --> 25:32.055
Any news on Vivien's hunt
for a murderer?

25:32.090 --> 25:34.024
Well, she had several clients
who came to her

25:34.058 --> 25:35.892
because of unsolved crimes
in the family,

25:35.927 --> 25:37.794
but the ones
that we talked to

25:37.829 --> 25:39.763
said that their cases
are just as cold now

25:39.797 --> 25:42.632
as when they first came to her.
(Ryan) Hey, I found the cab.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.301
The driver says he took Vivien
to a residence

25:44.327 --> 25:45.695
at 112th and Riverside.

25:45.787 --> 25:48.422
The doorman says he remembers
Vivien going up to apartment 2C.

25:48.892 --> 25:50.793
It's rented
to Nick and Toni Johnston.

25:51.607 --> 25:54.376
Toni Johnston.
T.J.

25:58.820 --> 26:01.390
If Vivien came to see
Toni Johnston the day she died,

26:01.486 --> 26:03.620
it had to have been about
something important,

26:03.711 --> 26:05.646
like this killer
she was chasing.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.248
But you'll probably say
it was just a coincidence.

26:08.283 --> 26:10.150
Castle, why is it
so important to you

26:10.185 --> 26:12.119
that I believe
all this stuff

26:12.153 --> 26:14.688
about fates and psychics
and Santa Claus?

26:14.722 --> 26:16.990
(Rings doorbell)

26:17.025 --> 26:18.459
Because...

26:18.493 --> 26:21.228
If you don't believe in even
the possibility of magic,

26:21.262 --> 26:23.163
you'll never, ever find it.

26:25.867 --> 26:28.368
Can I help you?
Toni?

26:28.403 --> 26:31.572
I'm Detective Kate Beckett,
and this is Richard Castle.

26:32.030 --> 26:34.798
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:34.833 --> 26:36.934
Oh, my God.

26:37.633 --> 26:39.067
I'm so stressed out.

26:39.101 --> 26:41.536
I can't believe
this is happening.

26:41.571 --> 26:43.939
So you know
that Vivien was murdered?

26:44.006 --> 26:47.108
When I saw the paper yesterday,
I nearly puked up my oatmeal.

26:48.225 --> 26:52.161
Why did Vivien come
to visit you on Monday?

26:52.195 --> 26:54.930
Look, this is all
very personal and private,

26:54.965 --> 26:56.566
and it involves my sex life.

26:56.641 --> 26:58.541
Will you promise
to keep it confidential?

26:58.576 --> 27:00.010
I--
absolutely.

27:00.044 --> 27:03.747
Okay, earlier this year,
I did a terrible thing.

27:03.781 --> 27:05.882
I had an affair
with my husband's boss.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.785
Very discreet--
no one ever knew about it.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.761
That's why Vivien called me.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.631
She knew about the affair?
She called me out of the blue.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.566
She knew we met
at the company Christmas party,

27:15.600 --> 27:18.535
that we used to rendezvous
at the Starburst Hotel,

27:19.840 --> 27:21.007
everything.

27:21.019 --> 27:21.853
Extraordinary.

27:21.897 --> 27:23.364
I know, right?

27:23.398 --> 27:25.266
I mean, my mind
was totally blown.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.734
An affair?

27:26.768 --> 27:29.236
Mrs. Johnston, did Vivien
ever talk to you about murder?

27:29.834 --> 27:31.735
No. She just told me she knew

27:31.769 --> 27:34.738
how I had cheated
on Nick, my husband,

27:34.772 --> 27:36.973
and then she asked me
a lot of questions about him.

27:37.008 --> 27:38.742
What kind of questions?

27:38.776 --> 27:41.644
She asked if he had a temper,
and if I felt safe.

27:41.679 --> 27:44.080
She was sure Nick did know
about the affair.

27:44.148 --> 27:46.549
Vivien said
the spouse always knows.

27:46.584 --> 27:49.486
Did she ever say
how she knew all of this,

27:50.496 --> 27:53.064
all of this
incredibly personal information,

27:53.099 --> 27:55.333
the details of which
could not be readily be found

27:55.368 --> 27:57.602
at a hall of records
or through an Internet search?

27:57.636 --> 27:58.204
Oh, yeah.

27:58.295 --> 28:00.630
The guy I was cheating with?
He told her everything.

28:01.564 --> 28:03.499
You know, I'm gonna
have to speak with him.

28:03.588 --> 28:05.956
Oh, oh, you can't.
I mean, <i>you</i> can't.

28:07.144 --> 28:10.213
He's dead. That's why
we stopped seeing each other.

28:10.247 --> 28:12.148
He died last April.
Heart attack.

28:12.182 --> 28:14.117
You're telling me
that your dead lover

28:14.151 --> 28:15.952
told Vivien about your affair?

28:15.986 --> 28:17.420
That's right.

28:17.454 --> 28:19.689
She said Emilio came to her
in a dream.

28:19.723 --> 28:21.090
Emilio?

28:21.125 --> 28:22.425
Emilio Casillas.

28:22.459 --> 28:25.461
Your lover
was Emilio Casillas?

28:25.496 --> 28:28.798
(Slurping)

28:29.592 --> 28:30.859
Well?

28:30.894 --> 28:32.928
(Straw squeaks)

28:32.962 --> 28:34.163
(Sighs)

28:34.197 --> 28:36.365
Emilio Casillas' autopsy file

28:36.399 --> 28:39.935
makes for
some very interesting reading.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.204
But do you think
he was murdered?

28:42.238 --> 28:44.073
According to the M.E.'s notes,
in addition to

28:44.151 --> 28:46.119
the cause of death, which was
massive heart failure...
Mm-hmm.

28:46.181 --> 28:47.781
Casillas showed signs
of alopecia,

28:47.816 --> 28:50.017
and his fingernails
were thinning.

28:51.321 --> 28:52.689
Which means what,
exactly?

28:52.701 --> 28:55.103
I'd have to exhume the body
and run some tests,

28:55.137 --> 28:57.238
but it could be
toxic overdose of selenium.

28:57.272 --> 28:58.673
And what's selenium?

28:58.707 --> 29:01.142
It's a mineral that's
naturally found in the body,

29:01.176 --> 29:03.077
and in small amounts,
is good for you.

29:03.112 --> 29:06.514
They even sometimes add it
to diet pills, health drinks.

29:06.548 --> 29:09.350
But too much of it
can be poisonous.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.041
Health drinks.

29:12.137 --> 29:14.104
Maybe it was also
in the vitamins

29:14.139 --> 29:15.606
that the Casillases made.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.275
So that would mean
it would be at the factory.

29:18.310 --> 29:20.078
Vivien told Toni
that her husband knew

29:20.143 --> 29:22.111
about the affair
with Emilio Casillas.

29:22.145 --> 29:24.613
So Toni's husband Nick works
at the Casillases' company.

29:24.648 --> 29:27.416
He would have easy access
to the selenium and to Emilio.

29:27.484 --> 29:28.918
And didn't
the Casillases' daughter

29:28.952 --> 29:30.920
say that her father died
in the office?

29:30.954 --> 29:33.036
That's probably where
he received the fatal dose..

29:33.123 --> 29:36.497
So Nick Johnston figures out his wife
is sleeping with his boss...

29:36.524 --> 29:37.691
Mm-hmm.
And he poisons him.

29:37.741 --> 29:39.742
And then Nick discovers
that Vivien's on to him,

29:39.790 --> 29:42.058
and kills her, too.

29:45.426 --> 29:48.361
Hey. So I just spoke to,
uh, Nick Johnston's Foreman.

29:49.601 --> 29:51.569
He said
that Nick clocked out early

29:51.603 --> 29:54.272
the day that Vivien died,
at 5:00.

29:54.823 --> 29:56.658
But his wife said he didn't
get home till at least 7:00.

29:56.670 --> 29:57.970
Well, that would've been
plenty of time for him

29:58.067 --> 30:00.935
to get to Vivien's office,
murder her, write the letter,

30:00.970 --> 30:02.871
all before the mail
was picked up.

30:04.304 --> 30:06.673
But how did he find out
that Vivien talked to Toni?

30:06.711 --> 30:08.645
Toni wouldn't have told him.
Oh, Toni didn't.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.113
But Vivien did.

30:10.148 --> 30:12.082
The Foreman said that Nick
asked for the time off

30:12.116 --> 30:15.007
after he was visited
by a woman, a woman who looked

30:15.107 --> 30:16.604
a lot like Vivien Marchand.

30:16.676 --> 30:18.343
So Vivien was putting
her plan into action.

30:18.377 --> 30:20.212
She'd bring Nick down
to her office,

30:20.246 --> 30:23.448
then she'd call Cody Donnelly,
have him bring his camera crew.

30:23.483 --> 30:26.985
She would confront Nick about
Emilio Casillas' murder,

30:27.019 --> 30:29.221
capture it all on film.

30:29.255 --> 30:32.624
Vivien was about to solve
Emilio's murder,

30:32.658 --> 30:35.059
and then be returned
to her former glory

30:35.281 --> 30:37.081
as New York's most famous
psychic medium.

30:38.266 --> 30:39.867
It's a pretty bold move.

30:39.889 --> 30:41.491
But how did she get on to
Emilio's murder

30:41.555 --> 30:43.923
in the first place
How many times do I have to say it?

30:43.958 --> 30:45.825
She was
a... (Whispers) Psychic.

30:47.301 --> 30:51.370
I'm sorry. What?
(Normal voice) Psychic.

30:51.405 --> 30:54.040
Or...

30:54.074 --> 30:55.675
Maybe just very intuitive.

30:55.709 --> 30:57.276
According to Vivien's notes,

30:57.311 --> 30:59.745
Paula said Emilio had been
working longer hours

30:59.780 --> 31:02.081
in the months
before his death.

31:02.115 --> 31:04.383
She wrote "affair?"

31:04.418 --> 31:05.985
She also wrote this.

31:06.019 --> 31:07.586
Starburst Hotel.

31:07.621 --> 31:11.461
That's the closest place to Emilio's
office that rents by the hour.

31:11.990 --> 31:14.788
The manager there said
Vivien came by last week.

31:14.127 --> 31:16.095
He confirmed to Vivien

31:16.129 --> 31:18.397
that the lovebirds had been
regulars early this year,

31:18.432 --> 31:22.468
and she gave him 200 bucks
for his trouble.

31:23.852 --> 31:27.855
Okay, but how does Vivien
go from "affair" in general

31:27.890 --> 31:30.458
to "affair
with Toni Johnston"?

31:30.492 --> 31:32.393
That, my friends,
is a pretty big leap.

31:32.428 --> 31:34.896
Yeah, uh, that is

31:34.930 --> 31:36.431
until you see the picture.

31:36.465 --> 31:38.032
This is
from Vivien's research.

31:38.067 --> 31:41.502
This is Toni in the red dress,
and Emilio next to her,

31:41.537 --> 31:43.571
at the company's
last Christmas party.

31:43.605 --> 31:45.740
Pretty cozy, huh?

31:45.774 --> 31:47.408
Where did she get this?

31:47.443 --> 31:49.377
Oh, there's a bulletin board

31:49.411 --> 31:51.279
at the Casillases'
vitamin factory

31:51.348 --> 31:52.816
where employees post pictures.

31:52.856 --> 31:54.724
She could've taken it
from there.

31:54.758 --> 31:56.993
So Vivien suspects
that Emilio is a cheater.

31:58.498 --> 32:00.900
She gets ahold
of his autopsy file,

32:00.934 --> 32:03.869
starts thinking that maybe
his cheating got him killed,

32:03.904 --> 32:06.806
and she starts doing
her usual <i>research</i>

32:06.840 --> 32:08.274
to prove her theory.

32:08.308 --> 32:11.343
And all of this investigation
leads her right back

32:11.378 --> 32:12.878
to Nick Johnston.

32:12.929 --> 32:14.863
She had it all worked out...

32:15.534 --> 32:17.435
Right up until
that awkward moment

32:17.470 --> 32:19.904
where Nick Johnston stabbed her
in the neck with an ice pick

32:19.939 --> 32:21.774
and fed her to the couch.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.650
You got the wrong guy.
I didn't kill that psychic.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.128
We know she came to see you.

32:25.138 --> 32:27.492
Yeah, she said she needed
to talk to me in private,

32:27.804 --> 32:30.372
said it was urgent, had
something to do with my wife,

32:30.407 --> 32:32.942
so I punched out early
and went Uptown to her office.

32:32.976 --> 32:34.944
And what did you do
when you got there?

32:34.978 --> 32:36.912
Nothing.
The door was locked.

32:36.947 --> 32:39.982
I pounded on it for ten minutes.
Nobody answered.

32:40.016 --> 32:41.918
I figured she was
blowing me off, so I went home.

32:41.935 --> 32:44.636
That's
a pretty convenient story.

32:45.011 --> 32:45.912
It's the truth.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.233
Okay. Why don't we start
talking about Emilio Casillas?

32:50.122 --> 32:50.958
What about him?

32:50.968 --> 32:53.017
You knew that he was
sleeping with your wife.

32:53.293 --> 32:55.928
They thought they were being
so careful, but yeah, I knew.

32:55.963 --> 32:58.798
So what did you do?
Nothing.

32:58.832 --> 33:00.266
Seriously, Nick?

33:00.300 --> 33:02.301
Do you actually
expect me to believe

33:02.336 --> 33:04.203
that you just sat by
and let your boss

33:04.271 --> 33:06.439
take your wife
away from you?

33:06.473 --> 33:09.008
Do you think I'm that dumb?
(Lowered voice)
She's not that dumb.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.388
(Sighs) I guess
it doesn't matter now.

33:12.422 --> 33:13.423
I...

33:14.008 --> 33:15.909
When I found out,
I went to Emilio

33:15.967 --> 33:17.901
and I asked him
to stop seeing her.

33:17.936 --> 33:19.837
(Normal voice) And what happened?
He said no.

33:19.922 --> 33:21.924
He was in love with her.
I threatened to tell his wife,

33:21.967 --> 33:24.368
and he just said,
"do what you gotta do."

33:24.402 --> 33:28.503
So I decided that I wasn't gonna
do his dirty work for him.

33:28.523 --> 33:31.091
If he wanted to leave
his wife of 30 years,

33:31.126 --> 33:33.073
then he should just be a man
and do it himself.

33:33.891 --> 33:35.626
But I wanted
to save my marriage,

33:35.723 --> 33:37.490
so I kept my mouth shut.

33:38.657 --> 33:40.524
Two weeks later,
Emilio was dead.

33:40.559 --> 33:42.426
And you did nothing
to help that along,

33:42.461 --> 33:44.762
is that what you're saying?

33:44.796 --> 33:47.098
Help what along?
He had a heart attack.

33:47.132 --> 33:50.614
The stress of being a lying,
cheating asshat finally did him in.

33:51.926 --> 33:53.960
Penny Marchand is here.
She says it's urgent.

33:55.863 --> 33:57.464
(Beckett)
Penny, what is it?

33:58.373 --> 34:00.975
Detective, I have something
important to tell you.

34:01.049 --> 34:02.983
Oh, Penny, is this about
the mystery man?

34:03.017 --> 34:04.865
Because I really don't know
any Alexander.

34:05.198 --> 34:07.332
Alexander?
Yeah, I'll tell you about it later.

34:07.842 --> 34:09.911
Penny, I'm in the middle
of a very important--

34:09.962 --> 34:12.063
Detective, you have to
listen to me.

34:12.098 --> 34:15.000
I know
who murdered my mother.

34:22.791 --> 34:24.792
So let me just...

34:24.826 --> 34:27.594
Get this straight.

34:27.629 --> 34:29.996
You're telling me
that you had a dream

34:30.031 --> 34:32.766
that your mother was murdered
by the Freemasons.

34:32.801 --> 34:35.969
In the dream, I was
having dinner with my mother

34:36.004 --> 34:37.603
in a Masonic Hall.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.373
She was very concerned.

34:39.407 --> 34:41.809
She kept pointing to men
around the room

34:41.842 --> 34:45.145
and saying,
"ask the Masons what happened.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.815
That's the only way
you'll get closure."

34:51.132 --> 34:53.867
Where are we?
Steve Adams alibi checked out.

34:53.875 --> 34:56.110
What about Nick johnston?
Well, I told him not to take
any trips out of town

34:56.143 --> 34:57.779
until we get this sorted out.

34:57.790 --> 34:59.525
Well, the good news is,
with this Freemasons lead,

34:59.615 --> 35:02.150
we have a whole new crop of suspects.
(Esposito and Ryan) Freemasons?

35:02.184 --> 35:03.785
(Beckett) Ignore him.

35:03.819 --> 35:05.787
So Paula and Marina Casillas...
If they knew

35:07.432 --> 35:09.967
that Emilio was cheating,
that would be motive.

35:10.002 --> 35:12.303
Maybe they found out that Vivien
was investigating his death.

35:12.705 --> 35:14.106
But they were
Vivien's clients.

35:14.196 --> 35:16.664
Why would murderers go
to a psychic for closure?

35:16.698 --> 35:19.466
They also have an alibi for
the evening Vivien was killed.

35:19.501 --> 35:20.935
Uniforms canvassed
the restaurant

35:20.969 --> 35:22.903
where they were dining
with friends.

35:22.938 --> 35:25.039
They were there from 5:00 P.M.
till after 7:00.

35:26.175 --> 35:27.877
Was this restaurant
anywhere near Vivien's office?

35:27.960 --> 35:31.296
Yeah, around the corner.
New place. Uh, Mason's.

35:32.310 --> 35:35.913
"Ask the Masons, and they
will give you closure."

35:35.947 --> 35:37.548
Let's not get carried away.

35:37.616 --> 35:40.918
Ask the Masons, please.

35:40.952 --> 35:43.320
Just this once.

35:43.355 --> 35:44.788
(Whispers) Believe.

35:45.774 --> 35:47.309
You know what's going on here?
No, not really.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.867
Me neither.

35:48.902 --> 35:50.335
No matter what happens,

35:50.370 --> 35:52.905
we will never
speak of this again.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.417
(Clicks cell phone open)

35:57.652 --> 36:00.287
(Keypad beeping)

36:01.166 --> 36:01.833
Hello.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.844
This is Detective Kate Beckett
with the NYPD.

36:04.369 --> 36:06.570
Could I speak with the owner,
please?

36:06.605 --> 36:08.039
Hello, Mr. Mason?

36:08.071 --> 36:10.739
I have a couple of questions
to ask you.

36:10.774 --> 36:12.942
Mrs. Casillas,
whose idea was it to go

36:13.003 --> 36:15.063
and visit Vivien Marchand
in the first place?

36:15.355 --> 36:18.224
We have had a very long day.
Please answer the question.

36:18.914 --> 36:20.348
It was my idea.

36:20.991 --> 36:22.426
Mother thought
it cost too much,

36:22.519 --> 36:25.388
but I missed daddy so much that
I was willing to try anything.

36:25.422 --> 36:26.756
And when she knew

36:26.767 --> 36:28.501
so many private things
about your father?

36:28.502 --> 36:29.836
It was almost
like being with him,

36:29.864 --> 36:31.018
like he was in the room with us.

36:31.028 --> 36:33.005
The night that Vivien Marchand
was murdered,

36:33.105 --> 36:36.250
the two of you went to dinner
with friends at Mason's.

36:36.404 --> 36:38.339
That's right.
It's a new place.

36:38.373 --> 36:39.841
My mother wanted to try it.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.781
The waiter confirmed
that you were there

36:41.815 --> 36:43.649
from 5:00 until 7:30.

36:44.962 --> 36:47.830
How was your meal? Did you
order wine with dinner?

36:47.865 --> 36:49.165
Yes.

36:49.199 --> 36:51.634
No, I mean, they don't have
a liquor license yet,

36:51.668 --> 36:53.302
so you bring your own.

36:53.337 --> 36:55.905
So you brought your own bottle
of wine with you, then?
No.

36:55.939 --> 36:58.542
Mother went out to the liquor
store and brought us a bottle.

36:58.624 --> 37:01.780
She was gone about 20 minutes.
And what time was that?

37:01.948 --> 37:03.982
5:15 maybe.
What's this all about?

37:04.017 --> 37:06.385
Paula, we went
to the liquor store.

37:06.419 --> 37:08.820
You didn't buy
that bottle of wine at 5:15.

37:08.855 --> 37:12.691
According to this receipt,
you bought it at 3:12.

37:12.725 --> 37:15.994
And at the same time,
you bought an ice pick.

37:16.029 --> 37:17.462
I don't understand.

37:17.709 --> 37:21.011
You bought that bottle of wine,
and then you put it aside,

37:21.045 --> 37:22.546
and then at 5:15,

37:22.597 --> 37:25.599
you left the restaurant and went
straight to Vivien's Offiice

37:25.633 --> 37:27.300
and murdered her.

37:27.335 --> 37:29.736
Then you went and you retrieved
the bottle of wine.

37:29.770 --> 37:31.471
You returned
to the restaurant.

37:31.505 --> 37:33.907
You had dinner with
your daughter and your friends.

37:33.941 --> 37:36.643
(Marina) That's crazy.
Mom, tell them.

37:36.946 --> 37:39.648
Why would she do something like that?
(Castle) To cover up another murder.

37:39.682 --> 37:41.950
Your father's.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.531
Did you figure out
that Emilio was cheating

37:44.565 --> 37:47.500
or did he tell you?

37:47.535 --> 37:50.436
He told me...

37:50.471 --> 37:53.573
That he hamet someone...

37:53.607 --> 37:57.343
That she was young
and beautiful...

37:57.378 --> 38:00.813
And that I was
just a boring old lady.

38:04.347 --> 38:07.182
I took some selenium
from the factory,

38:07.217 --> 38:10.085
and... every morning,

38:10.135 --> 38:12.036
I put a little bit
in his coffee.

38:12.070 --> 38:14.104
Oh, my God. Mom...

38:14.139 --> 38:16.540
When you wanted
to go see Vivien,

38:16.575 --> 38:19.009
I went along to humor you,

38:19.044 --> 38:22.211
but... she knew things

38:22.216 --> 38:25.085
that she shouldn't
have known.

38:25.099 --> 38:27.000
And then when she told you
that Emilio wanted

38:27.034 --> 38:29.102
to tell you
something important...

38:29.136 --> 38:30.671
And she said she was going to
spend the evening

38:30.676 --> 38:32.611
communing with his spirit...

38:32.645 --> 38:36.348
The cheating son of a bitch
was gonna tell on me.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.775
After everything
that he had done,

38:39.809 --> 38:42.377
I couldn't let that happen.

38:42.412 --> 38:45.547
I had to kill her
to stop him.
(Pounds table)

38:45.582 --> 38:47.082
Mother, stop talking.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.584
We want a lawyer.

38:52.689 --> 38:54.556
Paula Casillas
has lawyered up.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.491
He's already trying
to suppress her confession.

38:56.526 --> 38:57.993
Will that work?

38:58.027 --> 39:00.562
You know, I doubt it,
but Paula's done talking.

39:00.597 --> 39:02.497
Did you ask her
who wrote the letter?

39:02.532 --> 39:04.499
You know,
I didn't get a chance,

39:04.534 --> 39:06.468
so I guess it'll have to
remain a mystery.

39:06.502 --> 39:08.670
Uh, actually, not quite.

39:08.705 --> 39:10.672
Do you remember
the last clue,

39:10.707 --> 39:13.375
the sound of knocking from far away?
Mm-hmm.

39:13.409 --> 39:14.777
That would've been
Nick Johnston.

39:14.807 --> 39:17.009
He said he pounded on that door
for quite some time

39:17.043 --> 39:18.944
before he finally gave up
and went away.

39:18.978 --> 39:20.029
Vivien was already dead.

39:20.039 --> 39:22.443
Yeah, but Paula could've
still been in the office

39:22.444 --> 39:24.545
waiting for him to leave,
she would've heard the knocking

39:24.580 --> 39:27.315
just like she saw the phone,
just like she saw Albert Moreno,

39:27.349 --> 39:28.683
who was probably
dressed in black,

39:28.713 --> 39:30.739
so she just put it into
the letter to throw us off.

39:30.749 --> 39:31.787
Hmm.

39:31.616 --> 39:34.217
Only according to your timeline
on the murder board,

39:34.252 --> 39:36.753
by the time Nick
got to the office at 5:45,

39:38.900 --> 39:40.801
Paula was back
at the restaurant,

39:40.836 --> 39:42.903
so the office was empty,
