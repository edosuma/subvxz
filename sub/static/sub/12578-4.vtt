Twenty biology quizzes
and not one smiley face.

00:38.975 --> 00:42.435
Their grades are plummeting even faster
than I did when I fell out of that airplane.

00:43.046 --> 00:46.174
Ah Peggy, remember the therapist
said to go easy on your spine.

00:47.283 --> 00:50.878
You may want to shorten
your back swing on those check marks.

00:50.987 --> 00:52.478
Hank, the best therapy for my back...

00:52.589 --> 00:57.616
will be lifting my third straight
Substitute Teacher of the Year award...

00:57.727 --> 00:59.820
high above my head in triumph.

00:59.129 --> 01:00.096
[Exclaims in pain]

01:00.230 --> 01:03.698
Falling from that plane
may have broken my spine...

01:03.800 --> 01:05.132
but it could not break my teaching bone.

01:05.235 --> 01:07.066
No, not even if one existed.

01:07.771 --> 01:12.901
Mom, I think you're using
the English key to mark the bio tests.

01:14.343 --> 01:15.708
Oh..Well, yes.

01:15.245 --> 01:18.043
oh I'm not used to teaching
so much non-Spanish.

01:18.148 --> 01:21.446
Come on, Peggy Hill.
Rookie mistake. Get it together.

01:21.386 --> 01:24.684
Uh oh I don't have the bio answer key.

01:25.455 --> 01:27.286
Bobby, find me a frog.

01:28.660 --> 01:34.256
I would suggest you bleed out
the excess pressure in the bypass line...

01:34.364 --> 01:37.629
HANK: because if you don't have--
STRICKLAND: is that a business call?

01:37.768 --> 01:39.235
Not strictly, no.

01:39.336 --> 01:42.203
Hank, when was the last time
you took a day off?

01:42.739 --> 01:47.835
l took a day off when Bobby was born,
but l wasn't really sick.

01:47.762 --> 01:50.060
l meant to tell you,
it just slipped my mind.

01:50.164 --> 01:51.756
l did come in that Saturday.

01:51.866 --> 01:54.300
Would you get the hell out of here, Hank?

01:54.402 --> 01:57.565
I'm getting squeezed by some
insurance-company pencil stain...

01:57.672 --> 02:00.903
who claims working too long
without a vacation can make you sloppy.

02:01.008 --> 02:03.875
And when you're sloppy
in the propane biz, people die...

02:03.978 --> 02:05.741
and then my premiums go up.

02:05.846 --> 02:09.645
Sloppy? I challenge him
to find one single mistake--

02:09.984 --> 02:12.077
Just take some time off.

02:12.420 --> 02:13.614
See you in two weeks.

02:13.721 --> 02:16.087
Couldn't I just
take my vacation at my desk?

02:16.190 --> 02:17.157
STRICKLAND: No!

[Rock music playing on stereo]

02:22.630 --> 02:24.791

02:25.166 --> 02:27.964
After you win
Substitute of the Year this time...

02:28.069 --> 02:30.594
they might just rename it
''The Hill Trophy.''

02:30.805 --> 02:32.136
[Chuckles]

02:32.239 --> 02:34.298
l can't suggest that, Hank.

02:34.709 --> 02:36.301
You'd have to suggest that.

02:36.410 --> 02:38.469
l sure do have the time.

02:38.646 --> 02:42.514
This whole not-working thing is gonna
give me a heart attack, I tell you what.

02:42.616 --> 02:44.106
God, that'd be embarrassing.

02:44.218 --> 02:46.880
''Hank Hill found dead not working.''

02:47.888 --> 02:49.412
I wish I could stay and help.

02:49.523 --> 02:52.720
But until they invent a machine
that can stand in front of a band...

-Yup.
-Yup.

03:52.787 --> 03:54.277
What did you guys do?

03:54.388 --> 03:56.822
Any shaves today, Bill, or just haircuts?

03:56.924 --> 03:59.290
How's that new belt working out,
Boomhauer?

03:59.393 --> 04:01.759
-Dale, you kill any bugs?
-Did I?

04:02.563 --> 04:04.121
-No.
-Yeah, I did.

04:04.231 --> 04:07.291
It fell in the big jar of blue stuff
where I keep my combs.

04:07.401 --> 04:11.861
Was it small like an ant,
or crafty like a fly?

04:12.506 --> 04:13.871
I'm not sure.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.364
Fly.

04:16.442 --> 04:19.776
I'd come by tomorrow to pick it up,
but my plate's full.

Situation with a termite.

04:22.082 --> 04:23.947
Possibly more than one.

04:24.051 --> 04:26.986
Termites? Maybe you could use
an extra set of hands.

04:27.087 --> 04:31.319
Wingo!
But you gotta chip in for gas and poison.

04:34.895 --> 04:36.726
Here is the beauty of tenting.

04:36.831 --> 04:39.527
Ground zero's officially hot for a week.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.726
It takes two days to spray.

04:41.836 --> 04:45.203
The rest of the time
it's your own private playhouse.

04:46.207 --> 04:48.505
Go on. Take a spin on the bidet.

04:48.776 --> 04:51.574
Or did you think it was a water fountain?

04:51.712 --> 04:53.703
[Laughing]

04:55.516 --> 04:56.642
I did.

04:59.053 --> 05:00.543
I'm going home, Dale.

05:00.654 --> 05:04.590
I shouldn't even have let myself
sit on a stranger's toilet lid.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.994
Man, this guy's got bad eyesight.

05:13.467 --> 05:15.025
So, tell me about your day.

05:15.135 --> 05:17.695
How was math?

05:18.439 --> 05:21.203
We were doing conversions
on the overhead projector...

05:21.308 --> 05:25.210
and Mrs. Hosner erased
her mistakes with spit.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.379
Oh.

05:26.914 --> 05:28.279
What'd you do before math?

05:28.382 --> 05:31.146
That's my new favorite class. Shop.

05:31.352 --> 05:35.550
Shop? Bobby, from now on when I ask,
''How was your day?''

05:35.823 --> 05:37.791
I mean, ''How was shop?''

05:37.892 --> 05:39.223
It's great.

05:39.326 --> 05:42.124
Our regular teacher
eloped with the lunch lady.

05:42.229 --> 05:45.027
So, until the two of them
get back from Branson...

05:45.132 --> 05:48.226
Principal Moss is having us use shop
as a study hall.

What happened to shop?

06:04.151 --> 06:05.778
[Sighing]

06:07.421 --> 06:10.219
You look so tired, Aunt Peggy.

06:10.557 --> 06:12.422

06:12.993 --> 06:15.757
There is no rest
for a substitute teacher, Luanne.

06:15.863 --> 06:19.128
Except for 10 minutes every hour
and 45 minutes for lunch.

06:20.868 --> 06:22.893
i'm a pre-education major.

Maybe I could be a substitute teacher.

06:26.106 --> 06:27.835
[Laughing]

06:29.043 --> 06:31.637
Luanne, honey, I was not laughing at you.

06:31.745 --> 06:33.838
I was laughing at the idea.

06:38.085 --> 06:41.987
Sorry, the school board won't authorize
funding for a substitute shop teacher.

06:42.089 --> 06:44.557
We can't even afford to fix a dent
in the gym floor...

06:44.658 --> 06:46.523
where Coach had his little fit.

06:46.627 --> 06:49.755
You know, I remember a fellow
in my eighth-grade shop class.

06:49.863 --> 06:52.388
Pretty handy with a coping saw. Nice guy.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.694
His name was Carl Moss.

06:55.302 --> 06:56.701
Whatever happened to him?

06:56.804 --> 06:59.796
Got married, had kids, responsibilities.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.434
Things change, Hank.

07:01.542 --> 07:04.602
One thing hasn't changed. Kids need shop.

07:04.812 --> 07:06.074
Who's gonna teach them?

07:06.180 --> 07:09.741
The only man handier
with the coping saw than Carl Moss.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.545
-Jack Shermer?
-What?

07:11.652 --> 07:14.416
Jack was all flash.
I coped circles around....

07:14.521 --> 07:17.718
Me! i'll teach shop and i'll do it for free.

07:17.825 --> 07:19.019
Okay, Hank.

07:19.126 --> 07:21.424
With your wife
already a substitute teacher here...

07:21.528 --> 07:24.793
just keep the bitterness and
the ''he said, she said'' out of my school.

07:24.898 --> 07:27.025
We have a very good marriage.

07:27.134 --> 07:30.069
I don't wanna catch you two making out
in the teachers' lounge.

07:30.170 --> 07:31.194
You won't.

07:36.410 --> 07:40.244
Should I have the students call me
Mr. Hill or Hank?

07:40.481 --> 07:41.573
Oh, good Lord.

07:41.682 --> 07:44.549
And I thought I dodged a bullet
when Luanne wanted to teach.

07:44.651 --> 07:46.778
Are you comparing me to Luanne?

07:46.887 --> 07:48.377
Hank, sit down.

07:50.224 --> 07:54.320
i'm gonna do for you what,
at the beginning of my career, l did for me.

07:54.428 --> 07:57.056
Create a unified theory of education.

07:57.798 --> 08:00.358
Teaching can be divided
into seven spectras.

08:00.467 --> 08:03.834
The salutatory,
the attendatory, pedagoguory....

08:04.204 --> 08:05.865
Wait. Let's see, how's it go?

08:05.973 --> 08:10.034
Surf, Arnold, Perverse, Dinah. ''D.''
Oh, disciplinaria.

08:10.844 --> 08:13.904
...which brings us to sanitaria.

08:15.516 --> 08:17.677
Everybody looks pretty clean,

08:20.087 --> 08:22.146
l guess we could empty the trash.

[Stool squeaks]

08:30.898 --> 08:33.264
Son, could you stand up a minute?

08:36.370 --> 08:39.669
Cool. Is that a switchblade?

08:39.873 --> 08:41.841
No, it's a multi-tool.

08:42.476 --> 08:44.273
But it does have a saw.

08:44.378 --> 08:45.709
What else does it have?

08:45.813 --> 08:47.371
HANK: Well, it has a file...

08:47.481 --> 08:50.644
a serrated Sheep's foot blade,
a lanyard ring...

08:50.751 --> 08:51.843
you know, the usual.

08:51.952 --> 08:54.785
And for our purposes now, a Phillips head.

08:58.992 --> 09:01.256
Do that thing again.

09:01.562 --> 09:02.893
HANK: What? This?

09:02.996 --> 09:04.361
[Students exclaim in wonder]

09:04.465 --> 09:08.094
What were you kids working on
before they made this a study hall?

09:08.202 --> 09:10.295
JOSEPH: Birdhouses.
HANK: Let's see them.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.440
[Hank murmurs approvingly]

09:16.677 --> 09:18.110
[Hank grunts thoughtfully]

09:19.179 --> 09:20.612
Okay, Joseph.

09:21.748 --> 09:25.616
I don't see any reason
your father needs to find out about this.

09:25.719 --> 09:28.210
You know,
birds can build their own houses.

09:28.322 --> 09:29.584
They're called nests.

09:29.690 --> 09:32.989
But i've never seen
a bird build a boomerang or a dartboard.

09:33.193 --> 09:34.888
[Students exclaiming in agreement]

09:35.195 --> 09:37.686
Okay, everyone, put on your goggles.

09:39.199 --> 09:43.499
Now remember, everybody,
goggles might make you look cool...

09:43.604 --> 09:46.573
but they're also
part of proper safety attire.

09:48.175 --> 09:51.042
i have this one student,
kind of a troublemaker.

09:51.145 --> 09:54.512
He likes to leave his rabbet plane
lying blade down.

09:54.915 --> 09:58.715
But a project like this mini-foosball set
might just turn him around.

09:58.819 --> 10:01.720
So, can l assume
that my lesson plan got an A...

10:01.822 --> 10:04.052
or is your highest grade an A-plus?

10:04.324 --> 10:07.885
Actually, l was having a little trouble
with the file cards...

10:07.995 --> 10:10.190
so, well, l kind of winged it.

10:11.231 --> 10:12.255
Winged it?

10:12.366 --> 10:16.166
You professional teachers
probably have a special term for it...

10:16.270 --> 10:19.103
but l just fell back on natural instinct.

10:19.206 --> 10:22.198
lt might not have been a pretty win,
but l'll take it.

10:26.313 --> 10:28.975
That's strange.
We don't seem to have a bevel gauge.

10:29.082 --> 10:32.051
l'll bet you've got more tools
than the school does.

10:32.152 --> 10:35.485
And l bet the cost-benefit yahoo
who decided this shop could...

10:35.589 --> 10:39.457
do without a bevel gauge
has never even tried to test a bevel.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.357
Much less a chamfer.

10:41.461 --> 10:43.759
Yeah. The big yahoo.

10:43.964 --> 10:45.397
That's looking good, Bobby.

10:45.499 --> 10:47.990
Just remember to clamp your butt joint.

10:48.101 --> 10:49.500
[Snickering]

10:49.937 --> 10:52.770
-l get it.
-l'm sorry, Dad. l just--

10:52.873 --> 10:56.070
No, it's okay. You're right.

10:56.176 --> 10:58.474
The joke's on me.
You should use a miter joint here.

10:58.579 --> 11:00.012
That will look better.

11:00.113 --> 11:02.240
-Than a....
-Butt joint.

11:02.849 --> 11:05.613
-Right.
-Okay, son. Now you're just rubbing it in.

11:10.324 --> 11:13.384
When we take the rose
out of the liquid nitrogen...

11:13.493 --> 11:17.452
it becomes as brittle as the most delicate
crystal wine goblet.

[Students murmuring]

11:23.837 --> 11:25.532
[Chuckles sheepishly]

11:26.273 --> 11:30.607
The exciting thing
about the laws of nature...

11:30.944 --> 11:34.903
is that, well, you never know...

11:35.415 --> 11:36.939
what to expect.

11:37.918 --> 11:38.885
[Glass shattering]

11:43.423 --> 11:45.220
Nice sanding, Joseph.

11:45.626 --> 11:49.756
This napkin holder is smooth enough
to hold even the finest napkins.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.298
Your mom's gonna love it.

11:52.766 --> 11:55.098
You see, this is why we do shop.

11:55.269 --> 11:58.466
Not to be more popular
or to get into college...

11:58.572 --> 12:03.305
but to sand and drill
and chisel things for our moms.

12:04.478 --> 12:07.413
Hey, there, Peggy,
Welcome to my classroom,

12:08.715 --> 12:11.912
Hank, it's Mrs. Peggy Hill
in front of the voters.

12:12.319 --> 12:15.254
Or two-time Substitute of the Year,
Mrs. Hill.

12:15.355 --> 12:17.220
Yes, that sounds more natural.

12:17.324 --> 12:18.916
Didn't you hear the bell ring?

12:19.026 --> 12:21.722
ln two minutes, these students
will be tardy somewhere.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.955
Did anyone show you
how to fill out a hall pass?

12:24.064 --> 12:26.862
No, but l made my own
rubber hall pass stamp.

12:29.703 --> 12:33.639
Hank, what is gonna happen
when that falls into the wrong hands?

12:34.474 --> 12:37.568
l guess you don't have
a stamp to answer that, do you?

12:39.946 --> 12:41.470
Carl, l hope you don't mind.

12:41.581 --> 12:44.778
l jotted down some basic supplies
we need in shop.

12:45.719 --> 12:49.018
We don't have money
for all these fancy teaching aids.

12:49.122 --> 12:50.419
Like wood.

12:51.692 --> 12:53.853
You know, the Carl Moss l knew wouldn't--

12:53.960 --> 12:55.621
Give it a rest, Hank.

12:55.729 --> 12:59.825
All parents care about these days is
zero-tolerance drug policies, and literacy.

But, Carl, shop is the foundation
of all learning.

A youngster with a tool in both hands...

13:10.477 --> 13:12.775

13:13.780 --> 13:17.682
They'll just put the tools down if they
want to do the drugs bad enough.

13:19.853 --> 13:24.051
Joseph must have used the last piece
of maple for his napkin holder.

13:24.658 --> 13:28.321
l wonder if it was like this
teaching shop during World War ll.

13:28.428 --> 13:29.622
l don't know.

13:29.730 --> 13:31.721
You know what helped us win that war?

13:31.832 --> 13:34.858
People here at home
made do with what they had.

13:35.135 --> 13:38.502
Like when Clark's chair was squeaking,
we all pitched in and fixed it.

13:38.605 --> 13:41.005
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do now.

13:41.108 --> 13:44.339
This school is one big project
waiting to be fixed.

13:44.444 --> 13:47.277
Anyone notice that broken window
in the chemistry class?

13:47.381 --> 13:50.441
We could all bring some tools from home
to fix that window.

13:50.550 --> 13:53.644
Or re-hang the letters
that blew off the school last winter.

13:53.754 --> 13:55.847
And no one's gonna make fun of us...

14:29.222 --> 14:31.690
Remember, l called the drill press,

14:31.892 --> 14:33.519
Okay, then, Susie.

14:34.594 --> 14:36.562
l think they might like me.

14:36.663 --> 14:39.291
More important, though,
l think they might like shop.

14:39.399 --> 14:41.196
That's just wonderful, Hank.

14:41.334 --> 14:43.825
But remember,
just because they are liking it...

14:43.937 --> 14:45.905
does not mean they are learning it.

14:46.006 --> 14:47.371
Hey, Mr. Hill.

14:47.474 --> 14:50.568
And p.s., watch out for the brown-nosers.

14:52.946 --> 14:57.383
lf history teaches us anything,
it is that an informal pre-election vote...

14:57.484 --> 15:00.476
or ''straw poll'' favors the proven winner,
or the ''incumbent.''

15:02.622 --> 15:05.216
For our Substitute Teacher of the Year
straw poll...

15:05.325 --> 15:07.054
the incumbent would be me.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.390
Mrs. Peggy with a ''y'' Hill.

15:09.663 --> 15:12.154
Why should a straw poll
favor the incumbent?

15:13.066 --> 15:15.227
Good question. My theory is:

15:15.335 --> 15:19.465
voting for a winner
is a way for you to feel more popular, too.

15:19.739 --> 15:23.573

Carl, you used to know that.

16:58.138 --> 16:59.105
Well, maybe.

But according to the school board's
zero-tolerance policy...

17:02.309 --> 17:04.777

is a weapon.
