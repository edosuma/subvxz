Well, I'm catching

02:26.560 --> 02:28.000
Business in Genoa, is it?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.520
Yes. The consulate. I'm filing
a complaint against Danioni.

02:32.520 --> 02:37.800

business with my painting. You?

Very well, thank you.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.080
Very well. Yes.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.520
Mm.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.680
I think I tend to agree with you.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.360
Thank you.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.320
Your man is late.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.040
Give him a minute.
He's very dependable.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.600
Is that him?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.840
The very same.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.320
I told you he was reliable.

08:29.320 --> 08:33.280
Francesco has been a great help
to me, packaging the painting.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.520
Ah!

08:41.160 --> 08:43.600
Do come back down
for a glass of brandy and a cigar.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.280
Of course.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.480
Which, as you can see for yourself,
is very much complete.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.480
Andretti ti ha dato un
messaggio per me.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.640
Let's stick to English, please.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.840
I speak a little, Signore.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.680
Though sometimes it's beneficial
to pretend he doesn't.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.040
Hmm.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.800
Did Andretti give you
a message for me?

10:06.760 --> 10:08.520
Is Andretti happy?

10:09.880 --> 10:11.480
He confirms that the painting

10:11.480 --> 10:14.320
has been handed over
in perfect condition.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.600
Excellent!
I'll see you when I get back.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.480
Your receipt.

10:22.840 --> 10:27.080
I've included a reserve price
of £50,000, as agreed.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.880
Although we are clearly
expecting a great deal more.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.600
And this is your advance
in the form of a bank cheque.

10:35.080 --> 10:39.320
25% of a reserve price.
Less our commission.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.760
Looks about right.

10:45.560 --> 10:50.080
And I have your absolute assurance
the sale will be handled privately?

10:51.040 --> 10:54.040
Discretion is our byword,
Mr Ainsworth.

Oh, can I?

15:08.280 --> 15:10.360
"Hello."

15:10.360 --> 15:12.360
Teddy likes Annabelle.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.920
Does he?
Now, which one is Annabelle?

15:14.920 --> 15:19.560
There.  Oh!
Then Teddy has impeccable taste.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.360
But he can't be her sweetheart.

15:23.360 --> 15:27.080
No? Just because he's a bear?

15:27.080 --> 15:29.760
It's too soon, silly.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.000
Why is it too soon, Lots?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.680
I don't know.
It's what Mummy says.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.920
But they can still sit together.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.960
Lucian!

15:47.200 --> 15:49.520
We're having ourselves
a little tea party.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.000
Could I have a word?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.200
Of course you can. Here?
In private.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.760
Righto.
Aw!

15:57.760 --> 16:00.320
It's all right, Lots.
I'll be back in a moment, I promise.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.120

16:29.200 --> 16:30.360
Where did you get this?

16:30.360 --> 16:33.520
Where I got this doesn't matter.
What it says does.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.920
Why are you showing it to me?

16:36.920 --> 16:39.720
Oh, Lucian!
I mean it, Alice. Why?

16:39.720 --> 16:42.520
To stop you making
a bloody fool of yourself!

16:42.520 --> 16:44.000
And the rest of us.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.360
Lucian!

17:04.680 --> 17:06.560
Oh! There you are.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.280
Look, I...  Wait, wait, wait!
I have the most wonderful news.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.840
I have...
I've just spoken to Heddon.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.320
You're not going to believe this.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.280
It turns out the painting
was insured, after all.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.760
We're going to make
quite a tidy sum from the payout.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.680
Enough to put
a bit towards Lucian's wedding

17:19.680 --> 17:22.520
and pay off a few debts
I've accumulated,

17:22.520 --> 17:25.320
and maybe even bung a few hundred
your way for this place.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.080
But only if you promise not
to use it to pay your father back.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.760
HE CHUCKLES

17:31.640 --> 17:35.280
I... I thought you'd be happy.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.240
Sweetheart...

17:41.760 --> 17:43.400
I can't be happy.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.640
W-Was Billy still locked up?

17:56.560 --> 17:57.600
Billy?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.600
Oh.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.960
Yes, of course.

18:02.960 --> 18:07.000
Perhaps I can, er,
see to that myself.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.120
And then maybe when I get back...
we can talk.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.680
Bellakins...

18:16.120 --> 18:19.560
It was a nasty shock you gave me.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.920
I mean,
how's a chap supposed to react,

18:21.920 --> 18:25.520
if he finds out his wife's
been carrying on behind his back?

18:25.520 --> 18:27.760
And the whole town
seems to know about it.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.760
I mean, I see now...

18:31.800 --> 18:35.440
..I was perhaps a little more...
heavy-handed

18:35.440 --> 18:37.160
than perhaps was necessary.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.600
Yes.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.080
It's really not what you think.

19:00.080 --> 19:04.880
Hush, now. No need to make up
excuses for my benefit, honey.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.000
I... I did provoke him, you see.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.320
Don't give me any of that
"I blame myself" nonsense.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.640
Most kinds of men
don't need provoking.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.280
And I know most kinds of men.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.840
Do you want me to cover you up?

19:19.840 --> 19:22.880
No, no. I'll be fine.
Thank you so much.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.040
Well, at least let me put something
on that cut.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.320
You know you're stronger than him,
don't you?

19:37.320 --> 19:40.480
I don't think my face
would agree with you.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.720
I'm not talking about
that kind of strength.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.080
Any fool can use his fists.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.240
I've seen everyone here,
they... look to you...

19:53.560 --> 19:57.120
..for guidance, for wisdom,
for support.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.760
Thank you, Mrs...?

19:59.760 --> 20:02.880
Please, Claudine.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.760
Claudine Pascal.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.400
Claudine Pascal.
Mm.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.960
Thank you. It's... it's just
terribly sisterly of you.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.680
Now, that's a fine word.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.240
Yes. It is, isn't it?

20:36.840 --> 20:38.800
How do you do?

20:40.760 --> 20:42.280
How do you do?

20:42.280 --> 20:45.320
Yes!
Yes.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.080
My name is Alice.

20:49.320 --> 20:53.920
My... name is... Alice.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.320
No. Er, your name is Roberto.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.920
Your name is... Roberto.

21:00.920 --> 21:05.280
No. Erm, my name is Roberto.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.680
No, sono confuso.
Well, imagine how I feel.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.880
You can send me
the most exquisite gift,

21:13.880 --> 21:16.240
yet you can't even
introduce yourself properly.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.520
CLEARS HIS THROAT

21:18.520 --> 21:21.640
I could say anything I like and you
wouldn't have a clue, would you?

21:23.360 --> 21:26.720
I could tell you that you are
frightfully good-looking...

21:28.520 --> 21:30.640
..but, really, you're just a boy.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.640
I wouldn't be wasting my time
on this fool's errand

21:34.640 --> 21:37.200
if there were any half-decent
Englishmen left to marry.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.000
Aspetta.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.520
How do you do?

21:44.120 --> 21:46.640
Your name is Roberto.

21:46.640 --> 21:47.960
Huh?

22:01.360 --> 22:02.960
Thank you.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.840
Non ti preoccupare. Con questi
ti compri le sigarette

22:14.840 --> 22:16.360
e stai tranquillo.
Grazie, Signore.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.960
Francesco?
Signore!

22:18.960 --> 22:20.720
What the devil are you doing here?

22:22.560 --> 22:24.160
What is the meaning of this?

22:24.160 --> 22:28.080
It's just one cousin paying a call
on another, Signor Ainsworth.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.440
Right?
Cousin!

22:32.160 --> 22:34.240
Why am I not surprised?

22:52.840 --> 22:56.920
I was expecting a visit, yes,
from the British Consul,

22:56.920 --> 22:59.920
but from Signor Cecil Ainsworth?
No.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.040
All right, you've had your fun.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.640
No, really,
I'm surprised to see you here.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.320
Not as surprised as I was

23:06.320 --> 23:08.880
to discover we had a spy
in our midst all this time.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.600
So you wish to be friends again?

23:17.840 --> 23:21.720
Perhaps some of the language
I used the last time we spoke

23:21.720 --> 23:25.200
was a wee bit... Well, in the heat
of the moment, you understand,

23:25.200 --> 23:28.520
I may have accused you
of one or two things which...

23:28.520 --> 23:32.160
You mean, er,
"your greasy little insinuations"?

23:32.160 --> 23:35.760
In light of what we now know,
we both know,

23:35.760 --> 23:38.400
don't quite stand up to scrutiny.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.920
Obviously enough.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.840
So you wish to say sorry.
Oh, I can do better than that.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.840
Given your... intimate knowledge
of my dealings...

23:55.440 --> 23:57.920
..this is the price
I'm prepared to pay

23:57.920 --> 24:01.400
to bring an immediate close
to the police investigation.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.520
And... to secure Billy Scanlon's
release.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.640
As well as make reparations
for any hurt feelings.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.520
And this...

24:22.800 --> 24:26.600
Well, let's just call this
a gesture of goodwill.

24:26.600 --> 24:30.480
From one dog to another.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.720
HE CHUCKLES

24:38.080 --> 24:39.640
Let's have a drink.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.720
I'll say.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.160
I.
I.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.920
You.
You.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.280
He.
He.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.880
If you'll excuse me, Mr Albani.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.120
Mother?

24:52.120 --> 24:54.200
Mother!

24:55.640 --> 24:59.240
My name... is Roberto.

24:59.240 --> 25:00.360
Mother?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.360
Mother!

25:03.360 --> 25:05.480
Yes. What is it?

25:05.480 --> 25:07.320
What's happened to your face?

25:07.320 --> 25:10.280
Oh, n-nothing. It's just a scratch.

25:10.280 --> 25:13.040
Righto.  What is it?
I've something I need to show you.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.680
What is it, darling?
I thought you should see this.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.120
Letters.
Letters to Miss March.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.560
You intercepted her letters?

25:28.560 --> 25:30.160
I found them in her room.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.400
What were you doing in her room?
It doesn't matter.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.680
I've known about it for ages.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.160
There's something not right with her
and now we have proof.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.720
You have to put these back.
Immediately.  No!  Immediately.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.120
You're not going to read them?
Of course not.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.640
You don't want to know

25:42.640 --> 25:44.920
what kind of girl she is?
I know what kind of girl she is.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.200
Anyone can see that.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.440
She's conscientious,
she's kind, she's honest.

25:49.440 --> 25:53.120
And the mother of an illegitimate
child at 15 years of age!

25:53.120 --> 25:55.720
Where did I go wrong with you?

25:56.880 --> 25:59.000
With me?

25:59.000 --> 26:04.680
How could I have raised a daughter
who is so... unsisterly?

26:19.080 --> 26:20.880
I thought you'd be painting.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.680
Oh, I'm not...
I'm not really in the mood.

26:25.440 --> 26:28.520
It's our last day tomorrow.
Gosh. So soon?

26:28.520 --> 26:30.640
Three weeks have flown by.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.040
Haven't they just?

26:37.840 --> 26:40.480
We may not get a chance again
to speak properly.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.520
Oh, I hope we do.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.480
So I wanted to say thank you

26:44.480 --> 26:46.720
for all you've done
to look after me.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.120
To make me feel at home here.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.960
It's been my pleasure, really.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.520
And I wanted to give you this.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.680
Oh!
I've been working on it in secret.

26:58.680 --> 27:01.000
It's not very good, I know.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.360
I was going to say wonderful.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.520
You don't have to pretend.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.360
No, truly. It's... it's wonderful.

27:09.640 --> 27:13.080
You know, that you've done it for me
and that painting isn't your thing.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.640
It's really NOT my thing!

27:17.520 --> 27:19.000
I've tried.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.200
Really, I have.
To like it for your sake.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.160
I just don't see what you do in it.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.880
It's all just...
colours and shapes to me.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.640
Well, I think it's better
to be honest about it.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.640
You're not upset?
No, no.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.400
No, I think I'd be
rather more upset

27:44.400 --> 27:47.840
if I thought that you were just
pretending to like it to please me.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.520
But that's it.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.800
That's all I do -

27:54.800 --> 27:56.600
try to please people.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.320
Your mother, you mean?

28:00.320 --> 28:02.480
And everyone else as well.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.760
I try so hard to be interesting
when, really, I'm not.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.400
Rose, you ARE interesting.
I'm not even sure I'm very likeable.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.960
How can you say that?
I'm not stupid, Lucian.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.760
I can see that people
don't warm to others

28:16.760 --> 28:18.800
who can't be true to themselves.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.440
I can't see it myself.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.600
Can't see what?
That little love match.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.040
They'd have fine-looking children.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.120
So would we.
THEY CHUCKLE

28:51.040 --> 28:52.800
She isn't his soulmate.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.520
Do people have soulmates?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.640
Of course.

28:59.320 --> 29:03.520
But not if they're too afraid
to admit who they really are.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.320
Or what they really feel.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.920
Is it that obvious?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.560
To me, it is.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.040
You won't say anything?

29:20.200 --> 29:23.200
It isn't anybody's business
but yours.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.320
Have you tried telling him?
God, no.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.840
And I never will.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.400
I don't mean how you feel about him.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.840
Just how you feel in general.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.840
Why ruin the best friendship
I've ever had?

29:41.840 --> 29:44.120
It isn't much of a friendship
if that would ruin it.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.160
So you're just going to let it
eat away at you?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.880
What choice do I have?

29:55.480 --> 29:57.240
It is the saddest thing.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.000
I've come to terms with it.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.120
I understand.

30:11.200 --> 30:15.800
I wrote the book when it comes
to loving where it isn't allowed.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.280
CHURCH BELLS RING

30:52.920 --> 30:54.800
Now listen to me, Master Scanlon.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.400
You're hurting me.
I've paid good money

30:56.400 --> 30:58.320
to have you released,
you little bastard.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.280
And I can just as easily pay
to have you put back inside.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.280
I have Signor Danioni in my pocket,

31:03.280 --> 31:06.280
which means I have you in my pocket
as well.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.040
So from now on, if I say jump,

31:09.040 --> 31:12.400
your only question is,
"How high, Mr Ainsworth?"

31:12.400 --> 31:14.200
Do you understand?

31:14.200 --> 31:16.880
Do you understand?!
Yes, Mr Ainsworth.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.360
Good.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.520
Now get on with you.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.160
You need to be more careful, ma'am.
I know.

31:39.160 --> 31:42.640
I've always been terribly clumsy.
The return of the prodigal son.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.760
Oh! Billy!

31:44.760 --> 31:48.880
Oh! I've been worried to death!
You've lost weight.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.320
I've not been gone 24 hours, Mam.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.040
Come on. Sit down.
I'll make you a sandwich.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.520
Is he out on bail?

31:56.520 --> 32:00.120
Released without charge. They were
happy to take my word for it.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.600
I don't believe Billy
had anything to do

32:02.600 --> 32:04.640
with the theft of that painting.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.280
What about the bicycle,
Mr Ainsworth?

32:06.280 --> 32:08.840
I've persuaded them
to overlook it, Betty.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.520
Now that it's been returned
to its rightful owner

32:11.520 --> 32:14.480
and a small fee has been paid
in lieu of its loan.

32:14.480 --> 32:18.520
Oh, sir, I don't know how
I can ever repay your kindness.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.600
Just make sure the boy's nose
is kept clean from now on.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.240
That's all I ask.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.200
That's just it, sir.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.320
I've got my hands full here.

32:30.320 --> 32:33.920
But don't distress yourself, Betty.
We'll sort something out.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.640
Maybe it would be best, ma'am,
if I...

32:37.920 --> 32:42.560
..took the lad home.
You know, handed in my notice.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.760
I won't hear of it.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.680
We'd be utterly lost without you,
Betty.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.000
Oh, bless you, Mrs Ainsworth.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.280
Best get on with that sandwich.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.520
Welcome home, Billy.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.440
Oh!

33:13.720 --> 33:16.440
Bella! I need to talk to you.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.920
Bella, wait.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.360
Bella, for heaven's sake, wait!

33:21.360 --> 33:23.480
Cecil...

33:23.480 --> 33:24.640
Julia.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.840
You're in an awful rush.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.520
Your creditors after you
or something?

33:30.520 --> 33:33.880
That's very droll, Julia.
It was just a little joke.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.880
Well, the joke is rather on you.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.680
Shall we?
With pleasure.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.560
You catch me at an awkward moment.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.960
Indeed.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.280
Out.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.920
Have you enjoyed your stay with us?

34:13.920 --> 34:16.000
Tolerably.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.120
Oh?
I would have preferred

34:18.120 --> 34:23.040
to have seen and heard rather less
of some of my fellow guests.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.240
Oh.

34:24.240 --> 34:27.400
Well, I'm sorry to hear you
didn't find the company congenial.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.040
And rather more of you.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.520
Perhaps... that might be possible.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.360
What?

34:40.360 --> 34:45.480
In the, er, 18 hours we have left?

34:45.480 --> 34:47.200
Well, I intend to be in London

34:47.200 --> 34:49.240
rather more
than I have been of late.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.120
Something changed?

34:55.200 --> 34:57.200
My circumstances.

34:58.400 --> 35:02.560
And, of course,
there is this wedding to arrange.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.920
You have the means to go ahead?

35:07.200 --> 35:08.880
I do.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.040
Oh, Cecil,

35:11.040 --> 35:14.640
you have no idea
how long I have waited

35:14.640 --> 35:17.120
to hear you say the words "I do".

35:18.800 --> 35:21.720
And, er... do you?

35:25.120 --> 35:27.560
I most certainly do.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.520
Playing Hide And Seek?

35:48.960 --> 35:50.720
Something like that.

35:50.720 --> 35:54.920
Who are you trying to avoid?
Er... myself, as much as anyone.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.360
Oh, God,
don't be such a bloody misery.

36:00.440 --> 36:03.400
I have something
I want to share with you.  Do you?

36:04.760 --> 36:07.560
Your engagement is announced.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.400
Between Lucian,

36:09.400 --> 36:12.120
son of The Right Honourable
Mr and Mrs Cecil Ainsworth

36:12.120 --> 36:13.560
of Portofino, Italy,

36:13.560 --> 36:18.520
and Rose, daughter of Mr and Mrs
Ivo Drummond-Ward of London.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.440
What do you think?

36:23.720 --> 36:25.400
I thought we might, er...

36:25.400 --> 36:27.960
wander down
to the telegram office tomorrow.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.840
Of course, it does mean
you'll have to get your skates on.

36:32.280 --> 36:34.040
Of course.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.200
Is that going to be a problem?

36:37.720 --> 36:40.600
Uh, um...
Oh, Christ.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.200
Is it Rose you're trying to avoid?

36:43.200 --> 36:46.560
Not exactly.
Then what's the problem?

36:47.680 --> 36:50.120
I'm not sure that...

36:50.120 --> 36:52.560
You're not sure what?

36:52.560 --> 36:55.080
I'm not sure that Rose and I are...

36:55.080 --> 36:58.200
sympathetic.
I don't even know what that means.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.200
It means we're not well matched.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.880
Well matched?

37:02.880 --> 37:05.880
Our families have been marrying
into one another for generations.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.960
I mean emotionally.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.400
Now, look here...

37:10.560 --> 37:13.120
..all this womanish malarkey's
got to stop.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.120
Yes, you've had a rotten go of it,
and a nasty scratch,

37:16.120 --> 37:18.240
but the war's been over
for nearly eight years now.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.760
Yes, I know that...
Well, then, pull yourself together!

37:20.760 --> 37:24.920
You're alive, aren't you?
Capable of thinking, breathing.

37:24.920 --> 37:28.000
Walking. There are millions
who weren't so lucky.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.360
You don't think I'm aware of that?

37:29.360 --> 37:31.080
You don't think I spend
every day and night

37:31.080 --> 37:32.840
overshadowed by the very thought
of them?

37:32.840 --> 37:36.640
Then step out into the sunlight,
man. Learn to live a little.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.440
You're being offered the hand
of a beautiful girl

37:39.440 --> 37:41.200
from an excellent family.

37:41.200 --> 37:45.400
And a house in London and an income
of 1,500 a year to go with it.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.440
Most young men with
a drop of blood in their veins

37:47.440 --> 37:48.960
would be champing at the bit,

37:48.960 --> 37:51.400
not mooning around
worrying about emotions.

37:55.160 --> 37:58.200
This will be in The Times next week.
You...

37:59.320 --> 38:01.080
..do your duty.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.760
Yes, Father.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.320
Like I did mine.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.120
KNOCKING
Mm?

38:30.280 --> 38:33.640
I was wondering where you'd got to.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.760
Not you as well.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.160
Is something wrong?

38:41.160 --> 38:43.640
My father's given me an ultimatum.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.880
HE SIGHS

38:52.360 --> 38:54.840
Ah...

38:56.160 --> 38:58.720
Er... congratulations.

38:58.720 --> 39:01.760
Well, steady on,
I haven't even spoken to her yet.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.560
So, when do you plan to?

39:04.560 --> 39:07.520
There's no time like the present.
What do you...?

39:07.520 --> 39:10.760
That one.
Thank you.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.840
Sorry, did you...
did you want something?

39:15.840 --> 39:18.760
It's nothing important.
Are you sure?

39:18.760 --> 39:20.480
It can wait.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.800
Come here.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.400
Stupid thing.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.040
Do you ever wish
we could go back to that time

39:33.040 --> 39:35.560
we spent in France after the war?

39:35.560 --> 39:38.680
The convalescence depot
in Marseille?  Yeah.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.000
We were just so giddy it was over.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.720
To know we'd survived.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.320
Things were much simpler back then.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.560
Happier.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.080
Thank you.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.640
- But I have to pack.
-That can wait.

40:33.840 --> 40:37.160
Why you being so mysterious?
Because...

40:37.160 --> 40:38.920
I'm sorry,
I need to speak to you.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.560
I've been thinking about
what you said about

40:42.560 --> 40:44.600
how difficult you find it
to be true to yourself,

40:44.600 --> 40:46.640
and the truth is I feel
exactly the same way.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.160
You do?

40:48.160 --> 40:50.240
Yes.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.360
I've spent my whole life

40:51.360 --> 40:55.160
trying to live up to other people's
expectations of me and...

40:55.160 --> 40:59.520
not liking myself very much
as a result.

40:59.520 --> 41:03.880
The whole time we've spent here...
you've seemed so sure of everything.

41:05.440 --> 41:07.480
Well, maybe it's this place,
maybe it's Italy,

41:07.480 --> 41:09.840
maybe I...
Why are you telling me all this?

41:09.840 --> 41:12.680
Because I want you to know
that I feel we have...

41:12.680 --> 41:15.720
more in common
than you realise and...

41:15.720 --> 41:18.480
I don't want you to worry
about feeling yourself around me.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.040
Please, Lucian...

41:21.000 --> 41:23.040
..you don't need to do this.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.240
No, I don't need to do it,
I want to.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.480
I think you're very lovely, Rose.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.800
Just as you are.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.000
Will you marry me?

41:53.720 --> 41:56.120
GULLS SQUAWK

41:57.840 --> 42:00.440
INDISTINCT CHATTER

42:05.120 --> 42:07.640
Julia, Julia, come and stand by me.

42:07.640 --> 42:11.120
Now, where is the happy couple?
That's you.  Here she is.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.840
Ah, come on, Rose.
Don't be a wallflower.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.600
And where is Lucian? Don't tell me
he's done a runner already.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.920
I'm here, Father.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.000
Here he is.
Darling, does everyone have a glass

42:22.000 --> 42:25.120
of something wet and bubbly?
Yes.  I believe so.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.880
Jolly good.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

42:26.880 --> 42:28.200
if you could raise your glasses,

42:28.200 --> 42:30.840
I would like to propose a toast
to our happy couple.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.800
Lucian and Rose.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.800
Lucian and Rose!

42:37.520 --> 42:39.920
No, no, don't run,
go back to your station, please.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.040
Just serve drinks.
I'll go after her.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.960
Good lass,
just serve the drinks, all right?

42:45.960 --> 42:48.280
Oh, thank you very much.

42:50.880 --> 42:54.720
Oh, yes.
It's lovely, isn't it?

43:08.000 --> 43:12.120
Oh, I do so love a wedding,
don't you, Melissa?

43:12.120 --> 43:13.640
I've not been to any.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.320
Well, there's only one
that really matters.

43:16.320 --> 43:19.920
You must have a few suitors,
don't you, my dear?

43:19.920 --> 43:21.960
Goodness, what a question!

43:21.960 --> 43:26.200
I don't know, I feel that
there's so much more to do yet.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.040
Oh, really?

43:29.040 --> 43:33.200
Well, I'm very fond of you
and all I want is your happiness.

43:34.360 --> 43:36.480
I want to be a writer.

43:37.920 --> 43:40.160
A writer?

43:40.160 --> 43:43.480
CHUCKLES
If you say so.

43:43.480 --> 43:46.520
I do say so.

43:50.400 --> 43:53.280
Awfully decent of them
to throw me a victory party.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.000
Plum, darling, you're back?

43:55.000 --> 43:58.120
So, you won?
Ah, not quite, old girl.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.000
Lost to some Frenchie
in the third round.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.160
Oh, you don't seem put out.

44:02.160 --> 44:04.760
I had a little wager...

44:04.760 --> 44:06.520
on the other chap.

44:08.040 --> 44:11.120
So, are we all right?
We're all right, my darling.

44:13.080 --> 44:16.240
I might have some even better news.
Oh, yes?  Er...

44:17.400 --> 44:21.400
I, um, I've been feeling
a little strange and...

44:21.400 --> 44:23.720
I know it's probably
far too early to tell, of course,

44:23.720 --> 44:27.960
but I think that I might be...
You know.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.320
Oh, bugger.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.800
Ah, Wingfield, you're back.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.000
Ah, so it would seem.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.200
Has your wife been filling you in
on all the drama you've missed?

45:24.200 --> 45:25.680
Bits and pieces.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.800
Have you told him
he was almost implicated?

45:27.800 --> 45:29.360
Implicated?

45:29.360 --> 45:31.800
In the theft of the painting, man!

45:31.800 --> 45:34.320
I was just getting round to it.
Oh...

45:34.320 --> 45:36.000
I don't mind telling you,

45:36.000 --> 45:39.680
there were one or two here who were
ready to try you in absentia.

45:39.680 --> 45:43.280
But I told them, "He's an Englishman
and a sporting hero.

45:43.280 --> 45:46.240
"Plum Wingfield is beyond reproach."

45:46.240 --> 45:48.360
CECIL CHUCKLES

45:53.600 --> 45:54.880
Constance...

45:54.880 --> 45:57.400
I'm sorry, Mrs Ainsworth.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.600
What is it?
I hate to see you so distressed.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.600
I've lost something very dear to me.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.120
Ah...

46:05.120 --> 46:08.280
Yes, I...
Are these what you're looking for?

46:10.240 --> 46:12.880
You've read them?
No.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.640
But somebody has.
But you know everything?

46:17.840 --> 46:20.320
I know of your misfortune, yes.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.520
Then I'm dismissed.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.600
Dismissed?

46:25.600 --> 46:29.160
You cannot want me here.
Looking after Lottie.

46:29.160 --> 46:34.760
I can't think of anyone better
than a mother to look after a child.

46:34.760 --> 46:38.160
A mother who has
never had a husband.

46:38.160 --> 46:42.960
And has done her utmost
not to be defined by that.

46:42.960 --> 46:45.360
Who has abandoned her child.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.080
But holds him closest to her heart.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.960
Constance...

46:52.920 --> 46:54.960
..this is my Lawrie.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.600
Or Lawrence.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.360
He was my youngest.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.280
We lost him to influenza.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.640
He would have been 14 next month.

47:09.920 --> 47:12.240
Is he the reason you came here?

47:12.240 --> 47:14.240
Yes.

47:15.480 --> 47:17.760
A new beginning.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.400
I thought you would judge me.

47:22.080 --> 47:24.440
I've learned not to judge people.

47:24.440 --> 47:29.000
I think everyone... should be
given a chance to make amends.

47:31.880 --> 47:35.040
Until they prove themselves
unworthy.

47:37.400 --> 47:39.720
I don't know where to start.

47:39.720 --> 47:43.640
Well, why don't you start by telling
me something about your boy?

47:45.000 --> 47:46.720
Ha...

47:58.000 --> 48:00.920
A hearty occasion, isn't it?

48:00.920 --> 48:03.640
Hmm. My brother is a lucky man.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.360
Oh, yes.

48:05.360 --> 48:08.520
Miss Drummond-Ward is very charming.

48:08.520 --> 48:11.040
You are leaving tomorrow?

48:11.040 --> 48:13.080
At nine.

48:14.320 --> 48:18.400
Well, then... I look forward
to seeing you again soon.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.480
You and Roberto.
Before you go...

48:21.480 --> 48:24.360
I'd like to clear up
a misunderstanding.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.920
Of course.

48:25.920 --> 48:29.400
I hope you will reconsider.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.120
It is very pretty.

48:34.120 --> 48:36.160
As are you, Alice.

48:38.360 --> 48:40.920
Count Albani...

48:40.920 --> 48:42.920
I must speak the truth.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.880
But what about Roberto?

48:45.880 --> 48:48.440
I speak on my own behalf.

48:48.440 --> 48:51.120
You will grow old waiting for him.

48:51.120 --> 48:53.760
But you said...
It was a lie.

48:57.120 --> 49:00.320
This is absurd.
Why?

49:00.320 --> 49:04.880
Alice...
I am a man of experience and means.

49:06.080 --> 49:09.920
I'd like to look after you and...
your child.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.560
HORSES WHINNY

49:44.080 --> 49:46.040
'What would I do in Turin?'

49:47.840 --> 49:49.800
'You will learn to resist.'

50:00.080 --> 50:02.040
Ah...

50:03.680 --> 50:06.400
Mr Sengupta.
Mrs Drummond-Ward.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.560
Rose.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.960
I wasn't aware that we would be
travelling back together.

50:10.960 --> 50:14.840
We're not, I'm afraid.
I'm heading for Turin.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.120
I'm needed there.

50:20.360 --> 50:23.600
That was entirely...
I'm going to delay...

50:25.080 --> 50:27.280
Do you have other guests arriving?

50:27.280 --> 50:29.440
We do, we have a party of eight
arriving from Zurich.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.760
Zurich?

50:30.760 --> 50:33.760
Fortunately, we have a few days
to organise ourselves.

50:33.760 --> 50:37.720
Well... it's certainly been...
eventful.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.360
We do try our best.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.680
My aunt and I have both grown
very fond of the Hotel Portofino.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.200
Thank you.
Yes, we have.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.840
I'm going to tell
all my friends about the hotel

50:46.840 --> 50:49.440
and the genteel lady that runs it.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.960
Thank you.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.040
Might I see you again?

50:54.040 --> 50:57.560
Well, who knows, dear, at my age.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.240
Hardly.
You will write to me, won't you?

51:00.240 --> 51:01.880
Of course I will. Now go.

51:03.240 --> 51:05.000
Thank you.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.640
Lady Latchmere,
I do appreciate how understanding

51:07.640 --> 51:09.040
you've been about everything.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.280
Well, I wouldn't have missed it
for the world,

51:11.280 --> 51:13.640
it was like being in an
Agatha Christie novel.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.280
Not sure even she could imagine

51:15.280 --> 51:17.360
quite such a cast
of unconventional characters.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.720
A nonsense, my dear, it's the 1920s.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.520
Driver...

51:24.640 --> 51:27.120
Arrivederci.

51:27.120 --> 51:29.440
Arrivederci.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.120
I thought...

52:09.560 --> 52:13.640
I thought it might help
make us friends again.

52:16.560 --> 52:19.200
I don't want to be friends.

52:21.240 --> 52:23.600
And I'll never take a penny
from you.

52:25.200 --> 52:29.440
And if you ever touch me again...

52:29.440 --> 52:32.400
I've lived by your rules
for long enough.

52:34.560 --> 52:38.480
It's time I started making up
some of my own.
